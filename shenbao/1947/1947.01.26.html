<h3>政府實行改組計劃　尚在初步討論階段　雷震再來滬與各方洽商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕首都雨雪不止，關於和談及改組政府消，均陷停頓，雷震於廿四日赴蘇州轉滬後，更無任何活動。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政協秘書長雷震，將於今晨度來滬，與青年，民社兩黨及民盟方面協商改組政府事宜。據　悉內情人士表示：將來各黨派之參加政府，恐將出之於集體行動，如此，對內對外方能觀感一新，單獨某一黨參加政府，可能性殊少。又改組政府之範圍，亦爲關鍵所在，各在野黨派對於地方政府之參加，均相當重視。又各黨派對於參與政府後，是否能與政府中下級人員合作無間，亦爲重要之考慮。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕邵力子廿五日答記者詢問關於外傳二月一日將改組政府之消息稱：二月一日有新　，舊曆，舊曆且有二月與閏月之分，故今年有三個二月初，到底是那一個，你們</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕記者廿五日訪司使，請對和談前途及改組政府發表其個人之意見，大使含笑，連連點首稱：我沒有意見，我不說什麼。記者詢以前晤民盟張東蓀談話內容，大使答稱：談的問題很多。記者詢以是否涉及民盟之參加改組政府，大使答：此爲中國之內政問題，本人不能說什麼。記者再詢以政府如在最短期決心進行改組，政府此種現象，好抑不好，大使謂我沒有意見。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿五日電〕據接近政府人士稱：政府之改組，雖已決定，但規定日期尚嫌過早。改組之主要目的，乃在與各黨並共產黨在內，均分權力，從而打開現行政治僵局。反對各黨倘繼續高蹈，則改組即無意義。靑年黨與民主社會黨之參加，端視該兩黨在滬諮商之結果以爲定奪，但大體可以樂觀。川主席張羣即將返省料理若干政務，此行爲時久暫，不得而知。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨昨日下午三時於範圍召開中常會，伍憲子，萬仭千，徐傳霖及在滬常委均出席。張君勱主席，首先報吿在京與政府代表洽商之詳細經過，繼即討論和談擱淺後民社黨封於現局應採之方針，以及參加政府之基本原則。以會議中意見不一致，未作具體決定，定今日上午再行商討。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿五日電〕政府權威方面稱：政府之改組，或不及依照計劃於二月一日開始，改組計劃尙在初步討論階段，想在月底前三五天內，決不及有繼續發展。</p>
<h3>中共發動宣傳戰　規定政治軍事宣傳方針</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕記者頃自關係方面獲悉，「中共中央政治局宣傳部」卅六年度宣傳方針，其全文長達萬餘言，茲擇其較重要者摘錄如下：（一）因共產主義不管在鄕村或都市中，均已失去民衆信仰，今後應改稱：「民主主義」，以利宣傳。（二）對於「馬」「列」主義在現實情况下，也要停止宣傳，爲適合環境，應找尋事實引證三民主義，並利用孫中山以爭取人民信仰。（三）各地「民兵」「游擊隊活動情形，要改稱民變運動」。聞該項宣傳方針，已交全國各地共黨宣傳機構切實施行云。又重慶廿五日電，頃據此間接近新華日報人士之某君談稱，中共中央宣傳部爲控制軍事新聞，特於本月七日分電各地新華社分社及新聞從業人員，指示關於今後軍事消息報導應注意之事項如下：最近報紙對於我方之弱點及不合於民主之宣傳事實甚多，自應亟予糾正，故今後應特別注意下列十點：（一）思想上應確定吾人之新聞工作，要把握時機，在一般社會人士心理上下功夫，單獨盡宣傳責任。（二）每一軍事消息，不論其勝敗，應先衡量其對於我方之助益，如有關軍事機密，無論如何均不得發表。（三）對每一戰息，宜儘量報導我方戰果，縱是被迫撇退，亦以換得代價而論。戰果無妨擴大宣傳，使社會上對於「頑軍」實力懷疑。（四）凡間接暴露我方軍事機密之處，亦不得發表。爲執行上述各項，則必須：（甲）有關戰息情况，必須經當地指揮機關批准後始能發佈。（乙）各地軍事負責人，於每項軍事消息發表前，必須批閱，但今後在宣傳王應主動，因宣傳實爲戰爭利器也。</p>
<h3>民盟參加政府說　張東蓀加以否認</h3>
<p>恢復和談亦尙無可能</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟昨開中常會，對內部之組織人事，以及谷地之主持人選，均有詳盡商討。惟以事關機密，不擬對外發表。至於工作方針，決依政治宣言努力。關於擱淺之和談，因雙方距離過遠，無力斡旋。至於改組政府，根本不擬討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟秘書長張東蓀氏，昨對外傳民盟一部份人士，亦將參加政府之消息，加以否認。渠稱：民盟內部意見一致，不可能有人單獨參加政府。記者詢渠民盟前提恢復和談三項先決條件，政府對此有無表示？氏答：政府對此竭力想做好。渠對大局前途，認爲短期內尙無恢復和談可能。</p>

<h3>禁地方攤派人捐款　政院頒布補充辦法五項</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕政院頃頒布「禁止地方攤派捐款補充辦法」五項如後：（一）中央及省委地方之事項所需經費，應由委託機關指撥專款核實發給。（二）在預算核定及如須舉辦地方新興事業，應先依法辦理追加預算，呈奉核准後，方可舉行。（三）凡非法定徴收機關，不得逕向人民徴收任何款物，即屬法定征收機關，亦不得向人民征收非法稅捐或攤派款項，違者依刑法論處。（四）各縣市長對於所屬各級基層行政機構之非法攤派，如有縱容，包庇或監察不嚴，但經人民呈控査實後，應負連帶責任。（五）各縣政府及鎭保甲人員，如有擅向地方攤派，准由人民列舉事實證據，逕向省政府或中央呈控，經査實後，必予嚴懲。</p>
<h3>同伴中有劇團　可能爲被扣原因</h3>
<p>我大使館尙未獲報吿</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕「戈登將軍」號輪船駛抵舊金山時，林語堂女公子及中國外交部顧問李君之女公子兩人與其他中國乘客同被扣留，此間中國大使館方面今日宣稱，此事恐出於誤會，國務院方面則謂並未接到關於此一事件之抗議。中國大使館認爲船上之中國劇團或爲全體中國乘客被扣之原因，蓋劇團需要特別保證金，但如林李兩女士之流，不應被阻登岸。大使館方面尙未接舊金山張總領事報吿。</p>

<h3>法軍登陸西沙羣島　我即將發表聲明　白部長稱該島屬於中國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京廿五日電〕國防部白部長今日向報界談稱：西沙羣島屬於我國，我國當然派軍前往，歷史上證明該島屬於中國。同時王外長對此問題拒絕評論，謂渠將於一兩日內發表正式聲明，闡明中國立塲。外次劉諾則力言關於西沙島問題，目前并不在進行任何談判，亦無進行談判之必要。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕法外交部發言人稱：法國擬代安南要求對西沙羣島之主權。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿五日電〕據接近外交部方面之高級官方消息吿本社記者稱二中國爲謀法軍撤退西沙羣島起見，已與法國進行外交上之折　。中法兩國間之正式談判已分別在南京興巴黎二地進行，中國所採取之立塲，認爲法軍苟仍留駐島上，則中國絕不討論該島之主權問題。唯有法軍撤退之後，始可討論此一問題。另一外交部高級官員證實中法已在談判西沙羣島之事，但拒絕雨明目前中法談判中，是否涉及法軍撤退問題，抑討論主權問題。</p>
<p>該官員並重申西沙羣島之主權屬於中國，因該島向爲中國之土地，島上居民亦中國人，直至最近法國始與中國爭執該島之主權。</p>
<p>據國防部發言人稱：渠並未聞及派遣增援部隊赴西沙羣島一事，但渠强調稱：此稱事件似將由海軍部處理，據其個人所知，當法軍於數日前第一次企圖登陸時，島上駐有中國海軍陸戰隊一營。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿五日電〕接近外交部高級官方今日證實：法軍　議西沙羣島問題由國際仲裁一節，可　爲中國接受。幷強調稱：目前爲法軍撤退拔陶兒之問題。中國以前甚願考慮國際仲裁之建議，但法軍在西沙羣島登陸後，全部局勢已改變，直至法軍自西沙羣島撤退，中國不能考慮國際仲教之建議。</p>

<h3>中共始終堅持成見　堵黃會談無結果</h3>
<p>薛篤弼說明工程不可停輟之理由</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕關於黃河堵口情形及堵口工作之停輟利害，行總會於一月十七日邀集有關各方商談，有霍署長寳樹，水利委員會委員長薛　弼，聯總駐華辦事處處長艾其頓，副署長畢禮士，工程顧問塔德，及中共代表董必武等。董必武曾謂：中共區河堵險工，完全未作，河道居民救濟未辦，上上月廿七日已放水流入故道，未通知彼方云云。當由薛委員長加以詳細說明後，董氏表示堵口須停三五個月，未能談有結果。旋於廿日又作非正式會談，中央允對封口斷流工作，延至二月十五日，拋石工作，仍繼續進行。董氏又認爲雙方意見相距甚遠，須待請示延安後決定，卒無結果，但黃河堵口工程之停輟利害，按薛委員長稱：拋石工作，此時加緊進行，於工程固有益，於下游亦無害，反之，如停止三個月或五個月，至桃汎或大汎時再行堵口，於工程旣極危險，於下游亦不見有利，其理由如下：（一）堵口石壩，已進至成敗緊要關頭，目前所承受之水壓力極大，如停止進行，則石壩與便橋有全被沖毀之危險，欲避免全功盡棄，必需不分晝夜趕拋塊石，以與洪流搏鬥，爭取片刻之時間，最近正在積極拋　期中，尙時有木樁被冲情事，工程艱鉅，由此益可證明（二）自去年十二月廿七日引河開始過水歸入故道，但在此冬令水涸期中，即使口門石壩拋出水而封口以前，旣不斷流，則舊槽流量估計不過五百秒立方公尺·流速亦甚緩，在此期間，下游尙朱修復之堤工，儘可有時間修復；（三）下游河槽，經八九年之乾涸，一旦有水流入，則舊日之險工平工，事實上是否仍保持原狀，或將發生變化，及變化至如何程度，非俟實際過水，不能確定，現在過水不多，正可就此機會，作必需之觀察、以籌謀對策，對於下游裨益實多，如延至汛期過水，則流量太大，如有平工變爲險工，則措手不及，潰決堪虞。至中共方面，要求停止堵口工程五個月，是藉口下游堤工尙未修竣及河道居民尙未遷移，但該方（晋冀魯豫邊區政府冀魯豫行署）已於上年十一月十一日佈吿，曉諭沿河居民遷移及搶修冬防，可見其平有準備，即使堤工尙未修竣，居民尙未遷完，而現時水流甚緩，儘可趕辦。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿五日電〕廿五日午，修防處長孔令瑢等，赴洛口候黃河水頭下午五時，黃水過長淸屬之楊莊（洛口西廿里），九時可抵洛口。水深，流量及速度，因風不能測量。黃水改道已九年，堤岸年久未修，現國軍駐地已星夜培修，惟共軍駐地無連絡，且下游缺石料，培修情形不詳，桃汛期衆料可無虞，伏汛時必出大險，須加速預防。</p>
<h3>聯總空運救濟品　投送冀西中共區　美派機三架担任運送明日開始</h3>

<h3>承德各喇嘛廟　悉遭共軍摧毀</h3>
<p>〔中央社承德廿四日電〕承德八大喇嘛廟，始建於康熙年間，大部份照拉薩之布答拉寺，規模最稱宏敞，自經共軍摧毁，歡喜佛多被推倒，其七丈二尺獨木雕成之千手千眼佛，亦遭射擊，面頰槍痕宛然，廟宇壁殘垣頹，團無烟火，各廟喇嘛僅餘七十八名，缺衣少吃，設非列入難民，得受行總之救濟，殆已陷於凍餓。大佛寺住持坤希，職拉薩，乃達賴活佛特派來此之總理堪布，位居北方喇嘛之首座，今亦委頓不堪，籲請救濟機關施救。</p>

<h3>澀谷事件日兇手　三警長竟告無罪　我駐日代表將要求重審</h3>

<h3>經濟部潘次長談　解除日經濟武裝　日工業應限至一九一四年標凖</h3>
<p>〔聯會社南京廿四日電〕經濟部次長潘序倫今日談稱：該部現正審査全國著名經濟專家之各項方案，以謀在經濟上與工業上解除日本武裝，奠定世界永久和平。各專家認爲日本之侵略，由於無限制的經濟發展所激起，尤其在第一次世界大戰期間爲然，故聯合國應使日本之平時工業，限至一九一四年即第一次世界大戰初期之標準。聯合國遠東委員會提議日本之生產應恢復至一九二八年至一九三〇年期之地位，未免過於寬天，蓋日本利用第一次大戰後各國之不景氣，早於一九三〇年時樹立繁榮之經濟，使其準備侵略戰爭。聯合國一方面解除日本武裝，同時應嚴格限制日本之輕重工業，此種工業隨時可化爲戰時工業，故必須加以限制，以澈底摧毁其戰爭潛勢力。日本之紡織，生絲，人造絲、水泥及製紙工業，均有限制之必要。除日本人民最低需要者外，一切設備與機器應撥充對戰時受損最重各國之賠償？日本之對外貿易應儘力限制，以待與聯合國樹立正式關係，庶日本不能藉口進行對外貿易，而從事政治陰謀。日本之漁業，應受監視，劃定捕魚區域，以防其海軍力量秘密滋長之可能。最後，日太政府不應聽其採取任何措置，繼續鼓勵人口增加。爲糾正日本一般人之經濟狀態及防止人口過剩而引起另一</p>

<h3>台灣教育考察團考察歸來總檢討</h3>
<p>郭蓮峯幫辦告本報記者</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕敎部前派台灣敎育考察團程時煃（敎育硏究委員會委員）郭蓮峯（　藏敎育司帮辦）陳雯登（督學），於上年十一月下旬飛赴台灣，考察各級教育。程郭陳三氏頃已回京，上星期一向教長口頭報告考察經過，至觀感所及之詳細書面報吿，正在編製中。程時烽氏已往南昌家鄉一行。本報記者，頃訪郭蓮峯帮辦，詢以考察台灣省敎育情形，承吿如次：</p>
<p>學校概況　台灣省之高等敎育，有國立台灣大學一所、又有省立農工兩學院與師範學院。原有之法商學院，現已併入國立台灣大學。又私立延平學院，正在呈請該省敎育行政當局審核，尚未核准立案。中等教育骨是普師範，職業各校一百數十所。國民學校，數量亦多，敎育相富發達。考察團所到台中，台北，台南，及其他各地，每考察完畢一地，即隨時邀集各該地之敎育行政及敎學人員，開座談會，檢討敎育之實施硏究及應行興革諸問題，後在台北視察完畢時，並舉行兩次規模較大之座談會，台省敎育行政當局亦參加，爲台省教育新設施之總檢討，考察團方面，提出意見七十三條，經交換意見，結果圓滿。一行三人，本擬一月七日作歸計，因飛機停航，又在附近各地視察若干學校，待至十七日始起飛。前星期五抵滬，星期六回京，上星期一向敎部復命。</p>
<p>教育特點　台省中等以上學校校舍，以及敎學實騐之設備，規模相當宏大，非內地學校可比，關於教育上有數特點：（一）政治安定，各界人士對於敎育都認爲重要，協力進行，故敎育相當進展。（二）敎員服務精神，極能貫注，各校敎職員每日到校，工作八小時，上課前後，皆能在學校理學生，無課畢即走現象，因敎員皆係專任，以另行兼事爲禁。（三）敎員研究精神，極切實，不浮泛，頗多成續表現。（四）學校有家長會，與家庭切實聯絡，家長對學校經費及設備，甚多助益。</p>
<p>師資缺乏　台省各級敎育師資，均感缺乏，以台灣大學而論，現在仍有日敎授八十人留任，至中小學敎師，亦多以代用教員充任，其原因在日人時代，台灣教育，雖相當發達，多爲日人敎育而設，台灣人比較受敎育機會者少，因此人材缺乏，師資頗多降格以求，現在光復該地，幣制台幣一萬元，合國幣三十五萬元，供職該省在中學任敎職奢，月得台幣一萬元者，已屬最高待遇，其土著因住房及種種便利，減少開支，可以自給，故敎員待遇雖不高，而生活極其安定，若內地人前往，則寄費養家，不敷開支，且以遠隔海道，願往者不多，故救濟師資，爲當前最關切要之問題。</p>
<p>經費充裕　台省因行政當局注重敎育，對於省敎育經費，籌措充裕，而各縣敎費，間有少數縣份，因稅收改制關係，稍感拮据，此次考察團與該省當局商定本年度起，開闢稅源，增加附稅，以裕敎育經費之收入，前途更形樂觀。</p>
<h3>有照華僑入菲　竟被百般留難</h3>
<p>我領館向移民馬交涉</p>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺廿五日電〕甚多在上海美領事館獲得護照之我國華僑，最近抵達此間時，竟爲菲移民局予以不必要之拘留，若千華僑執有一九四七年之護照，彼等顯未注意菲外交部長於本年一月十日所發表之通吿。該通吿謂：每年之移民額，不能累積：其他被拘之華僑，僅因勒索賄賂而已。僉信此間中國領事館已與移民局商談，准此輩華僑入境，然此案今已鬧至此間公使館，蓋若干華僑訴移民局非法拘留彼等也。</p>
<h3>甥婿圖姦未遂　菜刀砍殺舅母　京市發生逆倫血案</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕舊曆元旦之晚、京市遊府街遊府新村八號，發生驚人大血案，被殺者爲張梅影，係刻在漢口十八兵站分監部上尉科員孫榮生之妻，身中菜刀，傷及要害，於事發後當夜不治身死。殺人犯經警方三日來之偵查，已判明即爲孫榮生之甥婿李延昌，綠李因在京習汽車駕駛，經其舅同意，與另一友人同室借居孫家，李年輕好色，對空房獨守之舅母，早存非非之想，事發之晚十時許，李友在另房，李乃乘機入死者之寢室，強圖行姦，當遭張氏拒絕，一時惱羞成怒，竟持菜刀將張氏砍成重傷，外定人聞聲趕至，李猶呆立房中，乃爲警方拘押，經三日偵訊，始供認圖姦未遂殺人諱。按一年以來，京市色情慘案，已發生多起，如去年四月之白鷺洲少女朱蘭落被殺案，迄今猶未結案。中央日報爲此特於今日刊出社論，呼籲「建立新的男女之防」，以正社會倫常。</p>
<h3>周逆佛海尚圖茍延　楊淑慧向高院聲請更審　能否獲准日內即可裁定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕奸貴周逆佛海，死刑定後，覆判書已於廿五日下午送達京高法院，並即轉送周逆及其家屬，至執行令是否亦已同時下達，雖有若干可能跡象，尚元法證實。惟依刑訴法第四二三條「聲請再審無停止刑罰執行之效力，但管轄法院之檢察官，在關於再審之裁定前，得命停止。」即使執行令業已下達，目前亦可能暫停執行。蓋周妻楊淑慧，於前日獲悉覆判結果後，即慌忙設法聲請再審，其再審書狀亦於廿五日晨提呈高院，由趙琛院畏發交前曾協助其本人審判周案之金（世鼎）葛（之　）兩庭以外之另一刑庭會商，判斷其理由是否充足合法，而裁定是否准予再審，以示公正。周妻再審書狀所列理由有二：（一）程克強彭素現均經軍統局釋放，彼二人可證明周逆曾自首，應再傳訊；（二）獨山大捷，乃周逆謀略之「功」，前審未予重視，應再調査。唯據熟悉案情者談：此二理由均難成立，幷不能謂爲新證據。關於第一點，程彭二人被釋後，曾有詳盡報吿送達高院，未證明周逆曾自首，關於第二點，國防部前已有覆文，謂與周逆無關，故周逆聲請再審之理由至爲薄弱，勢難獲得肯定之裁定，而依刑訴法第四六笠條「死刑應經司法行政最高官署令准，於令到三日內執行之。」設若周逆炎執行令亦已下達、或可於日內下達，此項是否准予再審之裁定，必將於最近期內即行決定，周逆末日殆已不遠。</p>

<p>〔本報南京二十五日電〕首都高院趙琛院長稱：丁逆默邨罪證調査完竣，即將定期公審。</p>
<h3>谷壽夫下月受審　昨起先開調查庭</h3>
<p>被害人屍骨即予發掘</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕南京大屠殺案主犯谷壽夫，業經國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭定期目二月六日至八日公審·該庭爲便利被害人或被害人家屬檢舉其罪行起見，特定自廿五日至廿八日止，每日九時至五時在中華門外雨花路第十一區公所設置臨時調査庭，辦事偵査事宜。廿五日晨，該庭庭長石美瑜，偕同葛召棠，葉在增推事等。親自前往。首由該區張區長召集各被害人家屬談話，並發出傳票二百餘張。旋有四十餘人報到，歷述當時被書經過，有年邁老婦哭訴伊子被殺，少婦申訴其夫被害等，均極悲憤。一老者名吳忠貴者，現年七十二歲，報吿當年其老母八十餘，姐夫七十餘，均遭殺害。又羊巷地洞內被其一次堵塞，殺害十餘人，而其殺害方式，難於詳述。據紅卍字會同善堂掩埋組組長劉德才，副組長戈長根之報吿，有被屠殺屍體二千餘具，埋於雨花台山脚下，另有金陵兵工廠被焚斃之屍體五千餘具，又秦淮河被溺斃貧民大七百具，掩埋河邊，均可挖掘。該庭原定二十五日午後發細屍骨，因天雨改期舉行，衆　谷壽夫罪案如山，萬難倖免一死。</p>
<h3>社論　遵守條約的義務</h3>
<p>古代閉關自守的國家，自給自足，與鄰邦不相往來，當無對外衝突的可能。迨後交通發達，國際關係頻繁，國　國之間互相依賴的地方日多，彼此摩擦的機會也隨着增加，摩擦而不得圓滿解決，就發生戰爭，戰爭的結果是創傷與毀減。西哲本悲天憫人之懷，倡以國際公法爲國際關係的規律，作爲各國共同遵守的準則，無形中消弭了不少的國際紛爭，奠樹了國際和平的基礎。惟是國除公法並不禁止戰爭，換句話說，國　國之間如有糾葛，仍可訴諸戰爭以爲最後解決的方法。而　國際公法僅係普通原則原理，關於詳細節目的規定，還賴各國互訂倏的，以資信守。所以就保障國除和平力量說，條約的功能實在高於國際公法。倘若各國都能遵守本身同意所簽訂的條約，則戰爭的可能性根本可以减少。</p>
<p>條約是兩個或兩個以上的國家，　於利書關係而訂立的，其目的在實現共同的希求，訂約各國自有信守的義務。就以和平條約而論，戰敗國簽訂於己不利的條款，固然出之情非得已，但一經簽訂，即生效力，不得因爲環境變遷而作毀的的企圖。推究條約的起源，遠在國際公法產生以前，古時各國本着宗敎和道德觀念，莫不視其爲神聖不可侵犯，非經雙方同意，不能藉故廢棄，否則根本失了信用，在國際舞合上難以站脚。近代國際關係日趨繁複，條約的需要性和拘束力更彼重視。在一九一四年第一次世界大戰爆發的時候，各國簽訂的條約已多至八千餘件，其中雖有不少因爲訂的的目的已達或時效已過而失效，但戰後增訂的條約也很可觀。單就數字一項來看，已可測知條約與國際和平的關係了。這次世界大戰的爆發，直接由於德國破壞凡爾費和的，九國公約，凱洛格非戰公約，和國聯盟約，所以應負破壞國際和平的責任。</p>
<p>戰後各國政治家努力重建和平，自從聯合國憲章通過以來，接着已有對意匈羅布分等五國和的的簽訂。對德對日的和約，不久也當可着手。在戰勝國方面已有彼此簽訂同盟條約以爲互助的；在安全理事會中，正討論普遍裁軍方案，將來或許簽訂多邊條約以作保證。從表面上看，國際間似可永樹和平了。可是今後國際和平的能否保持，多半還要看各國有無守的的誠意和決心。最近國際間發生兩件大事，都和條約的拘束力有關：一是蘇聯要求在斯匹决北爾根羣島的聯防，另一爲中國接收大連問題。</p>
<p>依照一九二〇年在巴黎簽訂的斯匹次北爾根條約，該羣島主權屬於那威，但不得設立任何防禦工事或海軍基地。該的第九條明載：「那威因加入國聯而負有各項權利與義務，那威担保本身不在本約第一條特別指明之領土上建築任何海軍基地，亦不允許其他國家建立任何海軍基地，且不在上述不得爲戰爭目的所使用之領土上，叭築任何砲台。」該條約的簽字國原爲美，英，加，澳，南菲，紐西蘭，印，丹，法，義，日，那，荷，瑞典等國，蘇聯後亦加入，所以應受該條約之的束。蘇聯因爲要謀加强其自認北方防綫脆弱之處，要求在斯匹次北爾根羣島聯防，已遭英美的反對，理由是蘇聯兩國如成立任何協定以爲該的宜予修改，應於事先徴求各簽　國的意見，不得片面決定廢棄。今後斯匹决北爾根羣島的聯防問題，無疑的將成爲國際間重大爭議之一，或許在不得妥善解決時，英美可能提出國際安全機構討論，條約的神聖不可侵犯性將經一度嚴格的測騐。</p>
<p>斯匹次北爾根羣島條約是多邊的，但由國收回大連問題是根據中蘇兩國所訂的友好同盟條約。大通向屬中國，旣而租於俄國，日俄戰後復轉讓於日本，論主權，轉讓原非合法，日本投降後理應物歸原主，由中國接收。中蘇友好條約中關於大連的協定，蘇聯鄭重聲明保證尊重中國管轄東三省全部主權，視其爲中國之二不可分離的部分，所以該的第三條明文規定大連的行政權屬於中國。中國方面同意宣布大連爲一自由港，對各國貿易及航運一律開放，並詳定細節，保證蘇聯在大連得有貨物進出口的利益。總觀中蘇友好條約的內容，實含互讓互惠的基本精神。可是條約雖早經生效，大連依舊未能收回。蘇聯對於中蘇友好條約，當然有遵守的誠意和決心的，所以大連的交還不應該長此拖延成爲國際問題。</p>
<p>遵守條約是各國的基本義務，也是維持國際和平的重要因素。希望各國政治家從遠處着眼，從近處做起，不要重蹈德日覆轍，甘負破壞條約的責任！</p>
<p>五年經濟計劃</p>
<p>五年經濟計劃，已經主席批准，交行政院執行。同時又據華盛頓電訊：進出口銀行發言人稱，中國如欲獲得美國已指定之五億美元借款，必須於五個月內整頓其經濟。換言之，中國政府必須於六月卅日，提出詳細計劃書，說明如何運用此項但其款云云。這兩個消息，不先不後，適同在此時發表，內中有無關聯，我們無從猜測。照常理論，此項五年計劃之起草，旣遠在一九四四年，自與五億借款無關。照事實論，所謂五億借款，旣係復興借款，且須提供詳細計劃，那麽，也許有部份的關聯。因爲此五年計劃，實際亦即是復興計劃。從使另起爐灶，重行草擬，也未必能盡脫其窠臼，這是可想而知的。</p>
<p>五年計劃的內容，分交通，工業，礦務，電力，水利，農業等六項。據謂：此方案包括許多專家之有價値經騐，故極切實際，而且就建築諭，其費用，人工，材料，及完工時期，均有凖確預算。可稱體大思精，與一般局部的或偏於理想的計劃完全不同。如果經費，人事等客觀條件確能配合，大家按步就班，循序漸進，相信這個計劃，必將爲我國經濟復興的骨幹。</p>
<p>現在全文還沒有披露，不知各部門的分配情形，尤其是農業方面的具體設施如何。一般觀感，尙在股切期待中。因爲靠近這二十年來，經濟上的建設，雖然着着孟晋，諸如公路，工礦等事業，並不因內亂外患而停頓，但農業方面的改進，比較地顯然落後。而且有幾種粗具萌芽的事業，例如美棉和美烟的推廣，蠶種的改良等，也多爲戰爭所摧毁。其他又因捐稅，　役，交通，治安等問題，還沒有整理就緒，以至閭閻騷然，使農村瀕於破產的危境。還在全局看來，雖僅佔經濟中之一環。然而我們須知，大部份的原料和日用品，其來源均在農村，而工業製品的去路，也以農村爲主要的尾閭。現在工業復員並未完成，各種生產，尙不及戰前之一半。但市面上許多貨品，已狠顯着呆滯和壅塞的現象。農民購買力的低落，已是無可諱言。加以廠用原料，如小麥，棉花，烟葉，羊毛，乃至蠶繭等，都不能不靠外貨來接濟，接濟偶滯，生產便有停頓之虞。從此看來，則復興農村，無疑地是經濟建設中最重要的工作。大家知道，我國農民，要佔到全民總額的八九成。這絕對多數的民衆，其生活程度，要是無法提高，乃至無法維持，在經濟建設上，要受到多少阻礙？</p>
<p>其次，則金融和幣制問題，原計劃內未見列入。我們希望，另有整個的辦法，能與之相輔而行。因爲現在經濟問題的癥結，乃在於幣制的不安定，所以整理幣制，實在是經濟建設的初步工作，也是經濟建設的重要工作。倘使現行的金融，幣制，及其運帶的利率，物價，工資等等，一仍其舊，不加以根本的整理，那麽，上項經濟建設，至少在進行上，要受到絕大的紛擾。因爲一切計算不能確定，便是一切計劃無從確立之故。我們推想：原計劃內所以未經列入，這或許是事屬急要，必須提前辦理，未便排定五年程序，從容漸進之故。</p>
<p>但在五億的美元借款以內，倘確如所傳，須先提出整頓經濟的詳細計劃，那麽這一件事，我們仍認爲是一個重要的節目。現在出口未能發展，僑匯大量逃避，而通貨膨脹，尙無收縮之象。如果要及時加以整理，我們相信，非求助於外資不可。外人的投資，其途徑自然狠多。除掉力求安全以外，其選擇的對象，當然以最有利益爲第一，如運貨來華，代辦工程，設廠，開礦，築路等皆是。過去一年之中，國際貿易，還沒有正式展開，但所耗的外匯資金，已極可觀。這項數字，不難從逐月的海關統計中窺見一斑。惟其入超太鉅，國際貿易愈形不利，所以政府對於進口貨的申請，已經逐步加以限制。照此推論，則所謂五億美元或其他借款，如果成立，其運用的途徑，當未必與過去一樣，仍任令流入於一般通常的用途。我們認爲最急要的用途，無過於整理幣制，安定幣値。</p>

<h3>火油抬價應予限制</h3>
<p>近來一般市民多用火油爐煮燒飯菜，故火油用度較廣，已為大衆重要日用品之一，最近市上商舖火油舊價，每五咖侖連聽費已由一萬五千元漲至三萬元左右，但查美孚及亞細亞等公司配售於各經理人之價格，每五咖侖速聽費仍售一萬二千元（內火油費七千元及聽費五千元）。然各經理人因鑒火油供應不暢，及金鈔上升之故，即奇貨可居，轉售商舖須每聽二萬數千元，即每聽得利一萬數千元，且聞各經理人，每逢得到火油公司配貨綫單後，不需勢付貨款，即可將該綫單拋售於人，從中取利，不勞而獲，應請市政府社會局設法限制此種中間人之不法漁利，以利羣衆。（盛本公）</p>
<h3>鄉自衛隊亟應成立</h3>
<p>近來滬西各鄉村，盜匪充斥，刦案時聞，鄉民惴惴不安。查滬西各鄉村，自保衛團奉令撤銷後，缺少武裝團體之組織，因此不能作有力之自衛，警局因管區遼闊，交通不便，雖晝夜巡邏，未嘗稍懈，各鄉義繁又人數不多，幅員廣闊，不敷分配，均感鞭長莫及。至保甲人員，參加協助，無奈徒手而出，豈能與執有武器之盜匪格鬥？故如欲消弭郊區匪患，則非各鄉村組織自術隊不可。蓋以郊區各鄉村民，世代居此，身家財產所緊，一遇盜刦，自可奮勇兜捕，若以各村聯防，旣可輔助警力之下足，亦可消戢盜匪之兇燄，誠為地方自治之良法，深望當局採納，亟令各鄉從速成立自衛隊，俾鞏固郊區治安。</p>

<h3>史達林接受英方保證　英蘇盟約仍有效　蘇聯建議將條約延長至五十年　貝文演說所引起之誤解已消釋</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿四日電〕英外交部本日宣稱：史達林元帥業已接受英國無意廢棄英蘇同盟之保證，並提議英蘇兩國共同考慮，削去英蘇同盟協定內有削弱性之條文，而再度延長此一協定之期限。史達林在送致英外相貝文之照會中稱，現已十分明白，閣下與本人對英蘇同盟有相同之見解。史達林之照會遂正式結束貝文演辭之誤解事件。衆信貝文之次一行動，當爲硏究史達林所謂英蘇協定有內「削弱性之條文」一語之意義所在。貝文曾示意正在計劃與蘇聯締結「防德侵略」協定，傳史達林並已同意將英蘇協定之期限延長至五十年云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四電〕史達林已接受貝文外相聲明英蘇盟約繼續有效之保證。蘇真理報最近會謂貝文於聖誕節廣播時所稱英國除負有對聯合國機構之義務外，不受任何束縛之一語，即爲宣布英蘇盟約已不復有效。經英仿再度聲明後，真理報昨仍維持前言，不承認英方之解釋。英外交部乃於今日發表貝文與史達林所交換之電文。貝文係於一月十八日電史達林，內稱，此次敝國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥來貴國，承蒙熱忱招待，令人銘感。茲就蒙帥携來之報告予以研究中，但對閣下向渠所稱倫敦或已認英蘇盟約及戰後之合作，已因聯合國機構之存在而停止有效之一語，深感不安。真理報前此對此已有誤解，余相信其他諸強亦常表示當以聯合國機構爲其政策之基礎。蒙帥曾告余謂閣下對英蘇盟約並不具有如真理報所言者之意見，余亦當然不具此意云。史達林於一月廿三日覆電貝文，內稱，閣下所稱英國不受任何束縛之語，確令余費解，認爲若不予以解釋，則難免被人用以破壞英蘇友誼。本人認爲無論如何英蘇盟約對雙方仍產生義務，本人前此已於上年九月十七日接見英記者華斯，表示蘇聯受有英蘇盟約之束縛，不因聯合國憲章而受有影響‘茲者閣下之電文以及貴國政府之聲明，已完全消滅誤解之原因，今始確知閣下以及本人對於英蘇盟約均具同一觀點。貝文於接獲史達林之電後，已令英駐蘇大使向史達林致謝其「坦白而有用之聲明」。</p>
<h3>英蘇兩國關係　或將有新開展　交換軍官事遭蘇拒絕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〔倫敦二十五日廣播：據此間消息靈通方面稱，英外相貝文三月間赴莫斯科出席外長會議時，將與蘇聯方面重開英蘇聯盟之談判。英外部發言人稱：英國政府之政策，厥爲與蘇聯覓取最密切之關係。</p>
<p>又訊：英參謀長蒙哥馬利前釙蘇訪問時，曾建議英蘇交換軍官，史達林已予以拒絕，據謂交換軍官用意甚佳，但此非其時，蓋恐被誤認係一種作戰準備也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕自史達林電覆貝文外相暗示若能消除「足以削弱英蘇盟約之保留」，蘇聯或可同意將該盟約之有效期自二年延長至五十年後，消息靈通方面預料貝文外相或當即行依據此項暗示而行事，第一步當爲探詢此等所謂保留之性質，盟的第四條規定於德國及其他前敵國再事侵略時簽約雙方應從事軍事互助，復曰該條當繼續有效，直至雙方聯合其他意志相似之國，採取共同行動保護戰後和平及抵抗侵略之建議時爲止。一九四四年十二月之法蘇盟約，已將軍事互助在已有一般安全制度確立之後，即不適用之規定删除，想蘇聯政府亦願將英蘇盟約之此項規定删去，以使軍事互助成爲絕對的義務。倫敦政治觀察家均信此一步驟未始不可採取云。</p>
<h3>英報論調一斑</h3>
<p>認條約有修正必要</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕英外相貝文與蘇聯元首史達林最近之就英蘇同盟條約之效力問題交換照會事，頃由英國各報加以評論。工黨每日前鋒報稱，「盟約極有修正必要，乃顯而易見之事，因此乃戰時之條約，其中大部份已不合時宜，故應改爲區域安全協定，一如聯合國憲章第八章所規定者。目前時機已至，應消除誤會，在和平時期之永久基礎上重建戰時之友誼」。倫敦泰晤士報稱，「不幸的誤會已導致幸運的結果，增進英蘇關係之次一步驟，將在三月間莫斯科會議中求之。」每日郵報稱：「史達林元帥明白希望更爲堅强之條約，甚至希望擴大範圍」。新聞紀事報稱，「未來英法同盟當依英蘇條約之路綫草擬，後者若有任何修改，或將影響前者」。每日郵報稱，「解釋莫斯科之心境，並非易事，史達林元帥最近數次對記者談話及與貝文交換之照會，暗示一種友誼態度」云。</p>
<h3>英緬談判成敗　目前尚難逆料</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教廿五日電〕英緬談判緬代表之一鄔鼎杜談稱，談話在友好之氣氛下順利進行，不可預示談判將歸失敗，英緬雙方均不能使談判失敗云。又一代表緬前總理鄔沙談稱，談判結果目前尙難預料，但此次可已談及各項問題，均互相有密切關係，需要鄭重考慮，預料須數日始能有肯定的決定。英政府對緬方要求已盡力考慮，設法予以接受，若不幸而談判失敗，亦不能歸咎英緬雙方云。</p>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿四日電〕緬甸反法西斯人民自由聯盟發言人稱：該聯盟已準備於英緬談判失敗後，即訓令該盟代表退出緬督行政委員會，緬甸在倫敦之代表團已奉召於一月卅一日以前返仰光。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦四日電〕消息靈通人士稱，英相艾德禮頃宣佈，將於下週初向下院報吿關於最近緬甸代表團在此間進行獨立談判之決議，據稱，會談將於下週一結束，該代表團即將於本月秒前進返仰光。聞艾德禮及其閣僚對緬甸所提各項建議，皆表同情，但曾向之力言倘緬甸能先取得自治領地位，則對於雙方均有裨益。此間觀察家談稱，緬甸領袖雖曾竭力要求完全獨立，但緬甸或將在英國聯治機構之內，先成爲獨立與自主之自治領地，俾可一收獲與英帝國通裔及軍事合作之一利益云。</p>
<h3>緬搜捕共黨領袖</h3>

<p>〔聯合社開羅廿五日電〕英政府今日向埃及政府提出新照會，車行聲明該國對於蘇丹問題之態度，觀察家相信此項新照會不能使一九三六年英埃同盟條約修約談判成立協議。英大使康培爾今日會見埃及總理諾克拉奇，面交此項照會。諾氏稱：定於明日宣佈覆文。雙方對於英國新照會內容均未披露，惟悉英國堅持　丹自決，反對埃及要求蘇丹併入埃及版圖，由埃及織王統治。</p>
<h3>世界銀行臨時行長　柯拉杜膺選</h3>

<h3>南非附和澳建議　主張小國應參加和約討論　蘇代表堅決表反對</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕南非聯邦代表今日在四强外長代表會中，提出關於小國參與會議之程序之意見，認爲應許各積極交戰國參加所擬設立各項委員曾之工作，小國應有提出意見，質詢問題，及接受文件之權利。英代表史屆朗謂，英國認爲小國代表應大體參加本屆外長代表之會議，法代表亦謂南非之意見有數點與法國相關。蘇代表古賽夫仍稱，外長會議之訓令有明晣之規定，決不許小國在目前階段參加四強代表會之工作，祗能應召蒞塲發表意見而已。美代表墨飛謂，外長會議之訓令應予嚴格解釋，辯論良久仍無協議。</p>
<p>調整疆界勿過苛求</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕南非聯邦代表史加倫及柯倫，今日在四強外長代表會中陳述南非對　和約之意見，謂南非贊成德國成爲分權而聯邦之國家，但不包括普魯士在內。此一聯邦國家得有中央政府，以處理外交及經濟等主要事務，基本目標在防止德國軍力之再生，而同時則不限制其經濟及社會生活之發展，使其得在歐洲佔有應得之地位。關於德國疆界問題，南非認爲不宜將大塊純由德人居住之土地劃歸其鄰國，認爲德國東疆至多應以奧特河爲界，若使波蘭國土深入德境，適足造成難以控制之摩擦。南非承認薩爾區對法國經濟之重要，但堅決反對該區之併入法國領土，良以該地居民幾純爲德人之故。南非對於荷蘭比利時及虞森堡所要求之小規模疆界調整，大致表示同意。</p>

<p>一九四七年之世界經濟全局，以美國爲最有利，而英方則甚爲難，俄則伺隙乘虛，向西進展。英美與俄對抗中之德國，相持之勢今昔逈殊。昔者英方應付歐洲大陸之傳統政策，每可不費鉅資而坐收宏效；如借法以抗德，或借德以抗俄，英方每便於結合「第二强者」，合英方與第二强者之實力，以共禦「第一强者」，以二對一，最易取勝。利用歐洲大陸方面兩强國相互抵制之妙訣，英以「第二者」之地位，於鷸蚌相爭之下接近一方面，坐收漁翁之利不甚難。</p>
<p>今則星移物換，不容如數年前之更藉德方兵力以抗俄，英美雙方乃需有等於昔日德方軍力之强兵，力阻俄勢之向西進展。此舉需款太昂，且今美國向海外爭取市塲，屬意中國與亞洲，並不注重歐洲方面，以是英須獨力對俄國，每苦岌岌難又。</p>
<p>最近自東向西之俄方勢力，在土耳其之韃靼海峽，希臘之薩則尼加，曁義大利之特里埃斯特各方面，步步進展，而在埃及希臘土耳其之英方勢力則日見衰沈，此後歐洲大陸之義法諸邦，將成俄國强有力之根據地。法國政局尙未十分安定，而義及西班牙兩國，均受美資接濟，義國戰後事業之復興，其進步定較法國爲速。</p>
<p>在北歐方面，俄國領土之擴展已饜所圖，一時自不必再攘新地，惟求速就已佔得之領區，成立各門新工業，俾堪自足以給以孳養本地工人。丹麥農產本甚富，最近被英國搜購一空，比則幸保非洲剛果殖民地，國內工業漸復原狀。比照戰前一九三八年之百分標準數，羊毛織品增百分之七十二，棉織品增百分之三十五。麻織品增百分之二十二，混合織品增百分之十八，服裝衣料之購求，已豁免分配限制。</p>
<p>荷蘭則自上年十一月十八日荷印和平協定簽字之後，一切東印殖民地事業經營之有價證券，在國內市塲突然貶價，各由原值跌云四分之一，荷本部對東印殖民地之航運公司及工廠，總共投資的四千兆荷盾之鉅，國內船埠及賴殖民地原料從事製造之工廠，因海上之貨不來，今悉陷於停頓狀態，且殖民地人民員額，數倍於荷本部，用兵於殖民地旣不易咄嗟致勝，其在兩方面交戰之際，農工事業受害尤深，欲求迅復原狀，又需有甚大之資本，而不得不向美方通有無。但美國爲自便計，寗願直接借款與新建民主政府之荷印，荷旣缺人，又缺資本，不易坐挽東印度之富源利藪，致其本部九兆之民，中有五兆恐尙須向國外移殖，察其所苦，似與革國略相同。</p>
<p>英則美債不易償，其合領屬並殖民地爲一大規模之經濟集團，總求賴出口貨之暢銷以抵償美債，惜乎此意，却與美國爭取市塲之旨相矛盾，致無以捷收良效。</p>
<p>美之爭取海外市塲，最注重者首爲中國，次日本，次則荷領東印度，後印度以及亞洲各地，其中南美諸邦，除阿根廷之肉市，暗與美國商務利益相衝突外，餘則早在美人掌握之中。</p>
<p>其次尙有廢除重工業單營輕工業，欲假兒童玩具之出口，用以淸償英美諸佔領軍消費之德國與日本，其對戰期新布設之美國玩具工業，可爲勁敵，德日之貨，物美價廉，不啻共美貨爭取市塲，又是經濟界一種矛盾。聞美工業家已籌對策而夢遊其貶價傾銷矣。</p>
<p>戰爭每因商務而興，順天者存，逆天者亡。我華修德右文，毋忘自身爲弱質，凡事能看淸世界全局，順其道而利用時機，因風使舵，借各方面外來之勢，以成遂我「向上」之希求，無不可收事半功倍之效。若僅受某一方面利用，而如中南美半殖民地之屢起暴動，毁人誠不足，自禍則有餘。</p>
<p>今我中華，乃如女性中之秀傑，忽被一個强有力之友邦愛上了，比諸德國與日本，走來或走去，均走不通者，天上人間，大有仙凡之別，中國人因風使舵，此正其時，順勢而趨易之至，智之極也。</p>
<p>予意絕非偏袒美國，試問今日之世，除美國外，尙有得餘力餘暇，誠心助我者乎，尙有更如美國之迷級我而愛我者乎。我國民生凋敝，百廢待興，如能因一個友邦之愛上了我，而急向張羅有計畫之借款，即以增强民衆購買力，推進對於美國不相衝突之中國出口貨。視爲消納美貨者治標之急需，復因敎育獎勵之方，位置飽學文人，提高民衆智識，用爲消納美貨者治本之要務，國利民福，豈有不隨之而進俱哉。</p>

<h3>行總真茹機廠舞弊案　起訴局全文</h3>
<p>聯總職員二人盜賣嫌疑將受我國法院首次審理</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總眞茄機器廠舞弊案業經地檢處偵查終結，提起公訴，承辦檢察官認為希智，歇陂洛二人，雖係聯絡職員，然為行總所借用而受我國政府監督，從事於公務之人員，其為公務員之身份已確定，退一步言，彼二人亦係受公務機關委託承辦之人，懲治貪汚條例第一條載明：「軍人，公務員或受公務機關委託承辦之人於作戰期內犯本條例之罪者，依本條例處斷，其非軍人公務員而與為共犯者亦同」。故被吿希智，歇陂洛，楊聲煥，李羅士，馬世懿，曹赤明，錢錚福等共同侵占盜賣，有懲治食汚條例第三條第二款：「盜賣侵占或竊取公有財物者，處死刑無期徒刑或七年以上有期徒刑」之罪嫌，尤以其中希智，歇陂洛述續盜賣，依刑法第五十六條：「通續數行為而犯同一之罪名者，以一罪論，但得加重其刑至二分之一」。故希智，歇陂洛等如所犯各罪屬實，依刑法第五十條併合處罰，則將來判刑必不能輕。聯總職員受我國法院審理處刑，亦將以希智，歇陂洛二人為第一次。茲刊錄其起訴書</p>

<h3>檢定棉紗品質　紡管通過採肅辦法</h3>
<p>並催各紗廠陳報成品以便收購　請購外棉以廿支以上棉紗爲限</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第廿一次例會於昨日上午十時，在市府會議室舉行，到吳兼主委，李副主委，委員束雲章，吳味經，王啓宇，榮鴻元，郭棣活，唐星海，及紡管會業務處長劉文騰。列席貨物稅局局長方東，及榮一心。討論至十一時卅分，始吿散會。</p>
<p>重要議案，共有三起：（一）催請各紗廠，速將成品應歸政府收購之數陳報。紡管會業已發出紗廠日報表及每週出售棉紗通知書各一份，惟各紗廠迄未塡報，致該會亦無法根據核發核定及委託收購棉紗通知書。現決請貨物稅局派駐各紗廠之廠員，代催各廠將本年一月一日起以迄目前之生產情形，速行塡報。（二）各紗廠不論其規模大小，如欲請購外棉，須以紡製廿支及廿支以上之棉紗爲限。同時須按照本會所定收購棉紗辦法，應將成品半數，撥交政府收購。其成品品質，尤須合平前定檢騐標準，否則其收購價格將比例核滅。（三）通過檢定棉紗品質採取紗樣辦法七條，並定本月廿七日起實施。茲將該項辦法探誌如次：</p>
<p>第一條各廠所產棉紗品質檢定，由本會主辦之。</p>
<p>第二條每次舉辦棉紗品質檢定時，由本會派員分赴各廠，按照規定辦法，採取紗樣，加封携會，以備檢騐。</p>
<p>第三條採取各廠紗樣之辦法，訂列於下：（甲）在各廠紡製每種牌號紗支之細紗間，由取樣人員，分向各車任意抽取紗管二十個，以爲試騐生量，拉力，條幹，撚度，及水份之用。（乙）在各廠成包間內，於每種牌號支別之棉紗中，由取樣人員，任意抽取輕重紗各一團（即10Hank，以爲檢騐長度及絞紗內容之用。（丙）在谷廠成包間內，就每種牌號支別之成紗中，由取樣人員，任意抽取一幷（即十磅），以爲試騐色澤及包裝之用。</p>
<p>第四條全部紗樣取齊後，應由取樣人員，隨時標明牌號，並請各該廠協助包紥裝箱加封，同時請廠方負責人在箱面封條上簽章，簽以資愼重。</p>
<p>第五條封條由本會製備。</p>
<p>第六條檢定棉紗品質辦法，另行訂定施行。</p>
<p>第七條本辦法有未盡善處，得隨時提請本會委員會議決修改之。</p>

<h3>木材紅盤略高</h3>
<p>昨木材紅盤，因天落雪，市塲到者甚少，所謂元寳交易，甚少做開，所開之價，比去年略高，洋松因申請書未出，脚地頗穩，衫木略漲。</p>
<h3>銀樓盤飾金掛牌價格　不得超過配價兩萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行負責當局，以本市各銀樓於農暦除夕時，擅將飾金掛牌價高抬至每兩四十四萬元。而實際上央行是日最高之配售價，除　十條係在每兩四十萬〇三千元之價格配出外，其餘大部均在四十萬元關內配出。足見各銀樓有抬價價牟利之嫌，故特重申前令，限各銀樓飾金每兩之掛牌價，不得超過央行配售價二萬元云。</p>
<h3>受金價堅穩影響　華股皆欣欣向榮</h3>
<p>華般昨疲後見梢，小般更爲見　，永紗，薄　，創新高價。晨初因金市疲怯而開低盤，開後除掉期外，九一號一〇四號四四號九七號即進現永紗，八五號二三二號一五五號九七號並購遞永紗，遞交盤升至八四四元，掉期由金融帮四五號二二〇號等貼進，永紗貼價在二十一二元間，合日息一角八光景，一九八號賣出，一五六號二三一號則　現永紗，一度回落十元，二三二號一五五號八九號仍進，三五號二二四號一四號九七號一再來進現永紗，近午全價急升，遞永紗盤升至八六〇元，新亞一度漲停，一四五號　高有供而稍　，結果較前收計永紗微升，信和，景福，新光，勤興各升半成強，華豐，美亞則漲一成强，遞交計永紗，美亞，新光各升半成強，華豐縐漲一成半，冷股繼續微升，塲外各股喊舊層年尾價有求。</p>
<h3>央行配售二千餘條　金價結果微升一萬</h3>
<p>烚赤昨頗爲穩定，央行雖供，但難　買冒胃，初低　高，晨開見低至四〇四萬有售，後以壓力及　給關係，曾下挫至三九五萬左右，央行即以是價配給二三九二條，嗣後　買及擁有餘資者，搜羅之下，供源見减，逐步回升，午刻曾扳高至四一〇萬外，結果較前日升一萬。飾金因央行限制銀樓祇可照配金加二萬之故，昨掛四十一萬五。銀之尙穩，錢兌業未開市，外幣喊價，無甚變動，港匯亦一三四〇元有供，暗息在一角半左右？</p>
<h3>秋絲開始收購　手續簡便隨到隨買</h3>
<p>秋絲成本核實，經宋院長批准後，央行方面，爲體卹絲廠商春節結帳，並扣除各項貸款欠額手續起見，即於二十一日下午二時，分別通知秋蠶貸款總管理處，曁中信局，中農行三機關，當日開始辦理收買事宜，第一日計收秋絲及零姚繭春絲共二百七十五祖，昨今兩日，又續收二百餘担。據秋繭貸款總管理處長孫伯和氏對記者謂：三十五年度蘇，浙，皖三省秋絲及零烘春絲產量，估計的共三千担左右，業已繅成並經檢騐合格者，計秋絲六六〇祖，零烘春絲二二五祖，其餘正在絡績檢騐送解中。此次買秋絲手續，爲求簡捷計，隨到隨買，並不規定彙解日期，絲廠商求售時，僅憑貸款總管理處一紙棧單，解交中信局，即能領款，預計此項工作，至多不過一月，當可結束。</p>
<h3>輸入臨管會發表許可證核發數額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：輸入臨時管理委員會執委會，對卅五年十一月十七日以前，業已訂購而尙未報關進口之輸入品，其屬於附表二及三兩類之輸入許可申請，業已發出之許可證，已佔全部申請案件百分之九十八。其餘極小部份，或係申請手續不究備尙待補行申請，或因故遭批駁云。</p>
<h3>新春市塲雜訊</h3>
<p>昨棉布紅盤平穩，交易絕無，紡建公司棉布亦未供售。　烟業市塲，昨雖已開市，但交易仍清，美烟價較堅挺，頤中捲烟轉疲。</p>
<p>日用品各貨，晨開交易依然寥寥，喊價與上週末相彷。</p>

<h3>中信將組評茶委員會　外銷茶決定收買</h3>
<p>收茶以本月底前運滬爲限</p>
<p>本市外銷茶葉收講事宜，茶商要求當局儘舊歷新年以前舉辦，以便度過年關，終以種種原因，未予實現，政府爲救濟商民起見，乃由中農辦理押匯，茶商得勉渡難開，茲據中信局負責此項事務人員談，現已決定採用以往中農公司收購茶葉辦法，進行收購，評茶委員會即可組織成立，除　定人員參加外，並聘定外商二人，充作顧問，收購茶葉，以本月底以前運滬者爲限，評價工作至遲下月初即可開始云。</p>

<h3>潘議長意見　私校學費問題　應求合法解決　決議案除依法提交覆議外無法變更</h3>
<p>本市私立中小學校長及敎師，昨在各報登載廣吿，發表宣言，認爲市參議會決議卅六年度私校學費小學十三萬元，初中十七萬元，高中廿二萬元，爲不顧教師生活之任意規定，記者特爲此事訪問參議長潘公展氏，叩以意見，據答：此案乃市政府交議之案，凡市長交議之索，參議會自應依法討論，依法表決，一切議案祇有取決於多數，此爲民主國家議會之通例。該案討論兩天，經過情形，具見報載，能通過酌加，已屬不易，此爲教員界參議員及在塲記者共睹之事實，若謂不顧教師生活任意規定，則恐未必盡然。教師生活清苦，家長負擔基重，雙方兼顧，自難盡如人意，年來物價高漲有增無已，辦學雖屬困難，假使私校經濟絕對公開，全受政府合法之監督，其真正艱苦狀況，如何能爲人人所瞭解，敢信必更能獲得家長之支持與社會之同情。至於市參會議決案應否遵守，爲政府之職責問題，苞有窒碍，除依法提交覆議外，實無他途可以變更。吾敎育界素多叫達之士，深願平心靜氣，以求問題之合法解決。</p>
<h3>本市私校教師　明向參會請願</h3>

<p>本市私立中小學敎師代表，定明日（廿七）上午，向參議會，市政府，敎育局請願，要求改善敎師待遇，增加本市敎育經費，佔市預算百分之卅五，並以半數津貼私校敎師。據稱：本市學生在私校者，中學佔百分之八十五，小學佔百分之六十七，而現時私校補助費，僅百分之三，猶未見發放。</p>
<h3>竺可楨博士談　中國留學生少實際經驗　主張乎腦並用以求實際</h3>
<p>〔菌新聞處倫敦廿四日電〕出席聯合國文敎會中國代表兼國立浙江大學校長竺可楨博士，業已抵達倫敦，訪問著名英國敎育機關及專門人材。記者頃謁竺校長於旅次，承發表下列談話：余生於一八九〇年，曾在塘山工學院，哈佛大學，依里諾州立大學，專攻地質學及冶金學，但數十年來之敎育經騐，使余相信現時之高等敎育宜重實際，少談空洞之制度。今日敎育法中太多專門化，因而中國留學生返國後，祇知理論而缺乏實際經騐，此實爲一重大之敎育危機。換言之，留學生缺乏　）礎敎育，不能手腦並用。故余此番乘出席聯合國文敎會之便，特來英國，觀光英國之一般敎育法，以資觀摩。余以爲太多分門別類之敎育法，決不能提高今日中國之生活程度，其結果或因而有書。就英國之敎育機構而論，牛津及劍橋大學雖過於古典化，但頗重視實際教育。余最初見英國一般學校缺乏設備，但此亦有其優點，蓋莘莘學子須手腦並用，以求智識，反之，如一切須依賴機械，則手腦決不能同時發展。</p>
<h3>武大學潮平息　明日可全部復課</h3>

<h3>市立國民學校本學期難添級</h3>
<p>因市預算尙未決定</p>
<p>卅六年度預算，尙朱經市參議會通過，市府會計處已通知各機關，經費祗能按照卅五年預算數辦理，新增事業部份，暫從緩辦，因此本市市立國民學校，本學期勢將難於增級，聞市郊各區地方人士，已自行設法校舍校具，向敎局請求開辦國民學校者，已有二十餘校，各中心國民學校及保國民學校，請求添級者共有百餘級，均因爲預算所限，不能設立或增添。但在學校方面，因報名人數異常擁擠，維持卅五年度原狀，其勢有所不能，聞一部份校長將相的至市教育局，市政府，及市參議會，分別請願，俾吿校得在開學前決定添級，收容失學兒童云。</p>
<h3>洛克斐勒基金會　撥付最後一筆捐款　協助平協和醫院</h3>
<p>〔美國新間處華成頓廿四日電〕洛克斐勒　金會頃宣布：對中國醫學委員會最後一决之捐款一千萬美元，以齊支持北平之協和醫學院。總計該基金會，自一九一五年以來，在此一方面共撥款四千四百六十五萬二千四百九十美元，爲該基金會歷史中最大之津貼。洛克斐勒基金會保管委員會主席福斯迪克，致函中國聲學委員會主席派克，引述北平協和醫學院「偉大之成績」稱：「基金會乘撥付最後一筆捐款之機會，重新奉獻該學院，與中國新生之一代，堅信該學院在近代醫學中所發佈之光芒，將不致令其熄滅。」</p>

<h3>左舜生建議當局　各校設憲法講座</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：左舜生此次在京時，曾向張羣，陳立夫，吳鼎昌等建議，在大學內普遍設立憲法講座，中政治學者講演我國憲法內容及制憲史，以提高靑年對於憲法之正確認識，不爲宣傳所惑。同時中學亦增設憲法課程，使學生對國家之根不法有所了解。左氏並指出十二歲之法國兒童，在課本上即有人權宣言，此點値得我國取法。聞張陳吳三氏對此均表贊成。</p>
<h3>國民學校被焚　吳長允擇地重建</h3>
<p>本市陜西北路（即西摩路）國民學校，於本月廿二日被隣居失火，延燒焚燬，業經市敎育局顧局長，向市政會議提請，准予即日擇地建造校舍，作爲獻校祝壽之　範，巳蒙吳市長面示許可。並聞敎局已派員向地政局洽商，在第十二區範圍內，撥給公地一方，作爲建校之用，至校舍圖樣決定後，即可與工務局接洽建築辦法，費用的在二萬萬元左右。</p>

<h3>滬港埠際足球賽　昨戰成和局　零比零雙方未開綠錄李惠堂射十二碼未中</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港廿五日電〕港滬埠際足球賽，今日在此舉行，終塲時，雙方均無所獲，以天色已暗，故未延長。滬隊守門張邦褕爲全塲之英雄，救出險球不少，否則滬隊不免慘敗。賽時球常盤旋於滬隊區內，港隊先鋒，屢次突渦守衛綫，但悉爲守門救出，港中鋒李惠堂，罰十二碼球，中張邦綸之手掌，未曾入網。事後李氏謂不知何故，竟難以控制皮球，然一般觀衆，皆知李氏認該球有疑問，故意不使蹴中。賽時曾有兩次必中之球碰及滬隊門柱而彈出。</p>

<p>首塲開　戲，女子組綠隊與强華會師，綠隊兩戰連捷，聲勢煊赫，强華雖在林維聰指導下，擁有江美英，曹素珍，習曼英，曹曼珠等後起小將，恐仍難抵敵。</p>
<p>次塲甲二部，由綠林與V隊對壘，前者首戰曾取印第安番將，麾下擁有舒家義，王介平，陳正森，葉雲山等靑年好手，V隊球藝楚楚可觀，定有劇烈演出。</p>

<h3>正視我國戲劇</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>不料我的一封信竞给本刊编辑先生发表了。那祇是一封私信，僅僅对于某些事实，略爲提及，自然语焉不详。这么一来，倒非再说几句不可了。我全没有想批评玄　先生的意思，祇是慨嘆我國戲劇，不是被人盲目地推崇，使是被人盲目地攻擊，或者毫無顧忌，信筆揮洒，以致自評誤人。我國戲劇，已約有七百年歷史，遺留不可勝數的作品，現代分化爲幾十種不同的形式。這麼一種龍大的東西，決不是可以隨便對付的。其中的利弊優劣，很值得詳細討論。我現在先　出三點，爲以下說明的根據。</p>
<p>（一）我國戲劇，以音樂爲極重要的無素，或者不如逕直說以唱腔爲極重要的元素，現在各種戲劇，自崑曲（其實這也祇是一種唱腔的名目）以至楚劇，越劇，平劇（這是幾種發展最近的戲劇，盛行不過二十年乃至幾年），其最大區別祇在唱腔，而劇本，表演，舞台諸條件（包括服裝）都不過是次要的因素，但戲劇之逐漸脫離音樂而獨立，却是一確定的趨勢，所以我國戲劇已經到了非改革不可的地步。</p>
<p>（二）但戲劇的範圍極廣，決不可固執地從某一觀點立論面否定其餘。自古希拉到現代立歐美的作品，其問變化很大。從現代劇的格律來繩度莎士比亞，中古的神秘劇，亞裏士多芬斯，甚至於莫里哀，都不相合。但得客觀地承認這些都是戲劇，無論其外觀相差多遠。也得客觀地承認桃花扇，漢宮秋等與娜拉，哈孟雷特，安梯剛娜等有同樣的價值。</p>
<p>（三）藝術總得從自己民族的歷史文化出發，單靠外來的東西終久不能根深蒂固。筆者以在民間廣泛地演劇六年以上的經騐說：純粹西洋話劇的形式對於我國民衆總不大避合。必得從我國原有的戲劇裏學習，汰劣存優，重新創造一種民族形式的戲劇。</p>
<p>不過這是太遠了的理想，一時談不到。目前希望吏精確地研究四洋戲劇，同時也更精確地研究自己。先弄清楚了這究竟是怎麼一回事。再談其他。雖然認爲非廢止不可的話，也得到那時再下判決。</p>
<p>目前，關於我國戲劇，僅僅劇曲發展史大體明瞭。（但我希望許多已經明白確定了的事實不要再給人攪亂。）雖然也還有些細節未曾確定，但已不成大問題。可是，此外還有許多重要問題，幾乎是一無所知。例如：劇本方面，僅文　價僅（作曲的格律在內）受人研究。但處理內容的　本觀念，結構形式的主要方法，還沒有人過問。就形式講，有些地方　異西方，如時間空間之全不被注意，如人物之間多缺少糾紛，如悲劇立劇之不分，如冗長的四五十齣的編注等等。劇塲和表演的發展過程極少有人注意，現存的三十種以上的地方劇（多豐富的材料）無人研究。</p>
<p>有許多問題亟欲知道答案；可是自己旣無此學力，又見聞寡陋，也不曾讀到討論這些問題的文字。舉目四顧，不勝惆悵。例如！呂天成，李漁等人論劇本作法，極爲精到，又極注意舞台。何以我國戲劇的舞台性總不甚顯著，而阮李的作品不能與高湯孔洪等人並列元劇？明以前的南戲取材極爲廣泛，何以明以後　全集中於佳人才子？關漢卿和黃解元時代相及，他們之間，也就是說雜劇和諸宮調之間，有沒有過渡作品？崑曲全盛約二百五十年，自明嘉靖到清乾隆，何以爲劇本，表演唱腔都遠較原始的亂彈所打倒？各種戲劇的盛衰，是否有一定的公例？而各種戲劇間的盛衰，幾乎都是退行，即較原始的打倒技法上較完整的，何故？各種地方劇，尤其是小戲，如何所舉楚劇等，都擁有極廣大的觀衆，其優點何在？歐洲的神秘劇，頗和我國戲劇類似，大約還要幼稚，何以各有不同的發展？音樂原互不旣極重要，是否可以改革？如此等等。</p>
<p>所以我希望要正視我國的戲劇。攻擊，得找出眞正的　點，不能就現代西洋劇的標準批評，說沒有燈光盆景之類。也不能列舉某些劇本之有封建思想或誨淫誨盜之類。因爲佈景燈光原不是戲劇必具的要素，不能一槪來論整個戲劇。推崇，要找出眞正的優點，不能以臉譜身段唱工等充數。因爲這些或屬之演員，或無關大體。至於說王實釧的結構如何佳妙，更祇好　　外行的洋人。</p>
<p>我希望有人先從切實的材料工夫下手，且標確定，逐漸進展，終於可以弄清楚我國嚴戲劇究竟是什麼。爲了讓他們能夠從容着手，也希望無意於此道的人根本不要過問。</p>
<p>卅一年六月，蘇州凖提庵</p>
<p>這時，相反的，困居在淪陷區上海的徐　不僅與道君失掉音訊的聯絡，而卻每況愈下，不得不投考宏康公司的女職員，但以她是已結婚的人未被錄取，衹得又改就漢奸慮志明的家庭敎師，因着慮却被　妻憤而革退了。</p>
<p>於是他們母女生活起了恐慌，只好變賣了僅有的傢俱，而遷入環境複雜的平民區居住，她們的芳鄰有舞女及靠舞女生活的邸大班還有終日思子的瘋老頭子和相依爲侖的三輪車夫阿根母子。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事爆發，敵人佔領整個上海，內地消息更是無從探尋了，徐慧一面苦支着她和愛女的生計一面焦慮着道君同赴戰塲的李杰成這時被派來上海，担任着某項秘密工作，在一次敵僞警探追擊中，他偶着徐　，徐將他藏匿家中爲其治療傷口，並苦詢道君下落，杰成亦不能答，盜彼與道君亦離開五六年矣。</p>
<p>徐　母女依然度貧困生活，在這悠長淒慘的幾月裏，僅有痴戀小玲的三輪車阿根與阿棍媽及李杰成的友情，是她們唯一的溫暖！</p>
<p>勝利給人帶來了歡欣，但也給人帶來災難，多少人家在喜慶着家人團　，而道君仍雋是消息杳然，一個更大的不幸落在她們頭上，小玲做工藉以養家的紗廠告訴她媽，又不忍看着一家陷入絕境，只得走上最後的一條　，去　求了她的「善鄰」邱大班，藉靠　抱生涯而苟延下去，每日夜半歸來，以紗廠僅開半工來隱瞞病母。</p>
<p>勝利後的道君經某顯要的推荐榮任了接收大員的美職，更名林傳薪被派來上海，大受各方逢迎，特別是自稱地下工作者的漢奸慮志明更　顏相事，道君亦曾囑人去以前住處探詢徐　下落，然終未獲確實去處，隨即亦置諸腦後，終日　應於　色塲中。</p>
<p>某舞廳中恰遇婷婷玉立能歌善舞的紅舞女愛娜，彼即小玲也，父女相逢，在「似曾相識未相逢」的迷亂中却一見傾心了。</p>
<p>聖誕節夜各舞塲通宵任歡，愛娜被道君苦留不放，當天明返家，正撞見倚門久候的母親，徐　發覺了小玲的隱　，大加責訓並以乃父爲一愛國乃顧體面者爲戒，寗俄斃亦不願女從是業，從此小玲即絕跡舞塲。</p>
<p>道君數日未見愛娜，托邱大班帶字條來約其在某酒家相會，被挑動芳心的少女也正熱戀着多，情多資的貴客，竟如約去酒家會晤，徐　看到小玲遺留的字條，追蹤而去，目睹與已女熱戀的舞客，即八年來日夜思念並以其自勉自慰的丈夫林道君也。</p>
<p>徐慧經此痛不欲生的刺激，病吏轉入膏肓，臥床不起，李杰成至，喜告已打聽到道君住地矣，小玲警喜欲狂，即欲與杰成往視，徐　忽大聲阻止，二人莫知所以，一再追詢徐　苦笑不答，彼實不願以實情相告　女也。</p>
<p>當小玲外出購藥時，道君又來相邀，適逢行將彌留的徐　，道君啞口，不能自　其說，唯囑咐，千萬不可外揚，因爲其現在譽地位着想，徐　以彼薄　，又　此亂侖大禍，遂痛擊而驅林外出。</p>
<p>風雨交加的晚上，徐　與世長辭了，小玲聽到母親臨終遺言，頓司自己所迷戀的舞客即生父也，小玲羞憤交集，痛不欲生，經杰成懇切諫戒，即隨李去遠處追求新生了。</p>
<p>等徒三思後的道君趕來　悔，已是人去樓空，恍若輕烟　渺隨風而浙去。</p>
<h3>「衣錦榮歸」故事</h3>
<p>— 顧而已</p>
<p>一九三七年上海某中學敎員林道君和他妻子小學敎員徐　及他們九歲的女兒小玲正度着幸福甜蜜悠閒的生活，不幸『八一三』砲聲響了，侵略的烽火燃燒了上海及大部份的國土，林道君激於愛國熱情，雖是在慶祝小玲的生辰，但也決然離別了嬌妻愛女偕同友人李杰成轉赴內地參加保衛祖國的神聖工作。</p>
<p>在激憤的情緒中他們踏上了征程，加入了　區救護工作，出入於砲火中，道君慣於安靜生活，不奈其苦，藉詞前方後方工作同樣重要的理由，告別了戰友單獨退出了火綫，走向戰時首都。</p>
<p>重慶找職業的困難使人地生疏的道君感到進退維谷，終於逼得去找他不願找的唯一舊友吳伯先。</p>
<p>吳伯先是三江貿易公司經理，在吳的冷顏下却命道君去做汽車零件的　客，道君萬般無奈，經再三的考慮，而決定走上了他相反的道路。</p>
<p>從此，道君居然一帆風順，由　客直家，而躍升到九豐企業公司的大經理了，連以前對道君白眼的交際花高麗琴也被吳伯先當貨品似的轉讓於道君了。</p>
<h3>「天堂春夢」</h3>
<p>— 徐昌霖</p>
<p>工程師丁建華，正率工人修建某前綫飛機塲配合國軍　反攻，有人自離機塲數十里之縣城，　馳至丁等工作地點，告以日本無條件投降訊，并示報章所載消息。丁等閱後，喜極欲狂，咸相慶祝不已。</p>
<p>丁馳　，告妻，時其妻潄蘭爲建華裝點心，因自己有孕三月，正作哎心，聞勝之訊，夫妻二人，與奮異常，遂於室內計劃，戰後甜蜜之家庭生活，丁并以久經繪製完成之精美住宅，圖樣，出示其妻，恍若　已置身其中生活矣。</p>
<p>不久，建華夫婦已返上海，丁有老母寄居與其遠石戚　某處，建華初抵滬，故亦暫居此。　有廠商數處，上海淪陷時，曾以物資資敵博取敵人歡心，而致巨富，勝利後，因未被人注意，故得逍遙法外，而借其金錢廣交遊。　見丁建華係來自後方，初甚把結也，但漸見丁並無辦法，而已另交有勢力之人物，欲將已屋招待貴賓，遂逼丁等　居。丁四出　屋，均因頂費钜大，手無金條，故久無着落，丁自念畢生建築巨　，　然聳立眼前，而已寬無着風雨之所，寄居於觀之下房一陋室中，頒傷異常。</p>
<p>爾臨盆在即，而建華數旬奔波，仍在失業中，更以老母操勞過甚，亦臥床不起，一病奄奄，丁至此乃萬念俱灰，憂憤至極，以餘資買醉，雨夜跟蹌而歸。適　宅證采燦煌，笙歌宴舞，司　者，疑丁乃小偷，竟擊之，事爲　知，得見丁所設計之建築圖稿，甚愛其優美，欲應之，蓋龔正熟戀某交際花，擬建築金屋，以藏嬌也。</p>
<p>臨臨盆產一男，無力撫養，與丁議之，擬捨之於孤兒院。事爲熟悉，　早年涉足花叢，斷傷過甚，故妻妾并無所出，乃向丁求撫作螟蛤，并應付丁若干代價，丁因生產費尙費着落，遂允之，惟龔力　丁等切勿將此事走漏。</p>
<p>龔妻對此子頗爲　惡。某日，龔妻對此子因非所出，任意虐待，潄蘭痛子心切，宛如刀割，即起憤而干涉，龔妻始悉此嬰乃丁家骨肉，因與潄蘭失和，乃將嬰孩鄰還之。</p>
<p>丁夫婦處此環境，決離龔家他去，然無處可以借宿，暫寄於其巨慶之簷下，殊不知此巨廈正丁當年所設計建築者。屋基留有丁名　留在上，丁見之，悲戀異常，遂潛入歷廈內，撫覧其心血之作，拾級而上，至五十餘　縷之頂，念及已身爲建築師，而一家竟至無蔽風雨之所，頹傷至極，忽聞地上人聲喧　俯視之，乃巨廈之門警正呵斥其妻子他去，丁　憤之餘，體力不支，忽失足下墜。待人衆往救，已奄奄一息，警察抬其自身上遺落之建築師證明文件，始知丁乃巨慶過去建築設計人也。路人莫不悲　異常。</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博長</p>
<p>夜夜春宵</p>
<p>並不是火樹銀花含星橋鎮　鎮開的春宵，而是大轟炸下的夜倫敦。沒有燈火的街道，情侶順步回家，火光起處，家剩下了殘壁敗瓦，也有少年男女置醉酒肆，溫馨的情意訴說未盡，一片硝烟，他們都永遠沉默了，這是劫難，但只有在這種生死關頭，人們才瞭解愛情在短短一生中有多少渴望，因此在汽車上他們對甜吻貪之無厭。我相信「夜夜春宵」此其他新年歌舞片的故事來得綺麗，較之「封面女郎」尤覺完整，雖然沒有「封面女郎」的燦爛花頭。數塲歌舞中，我獨稱賞「孤獨的哭泣」，衣服配色和面具佈景都極調和，包括芭蕾劇特有的象徵意境。「同營的女兵」一塲穿着衛生衫，倒是曲綫畢露，作一比較，珍妮白蘭似乎苗條一些，屬於「少女型」，麗泰海華絲咯形豐滿，已是婦人體態了。麗泰的歌舞索被哥菕比亞視爲搖錢樹，她的舞藝有時超遵福斯的蓓蒂哀蘭實，色相郤是蓓蒂甜蜜。小鬍子李鮑曼滿瀟　風流，允稱茂文陶格拉斯第二。珍刀妮白蘭嬌媚勝昔，「想入非非」「浪漫水手」中的演出自然不及。瑪克派禮特的舞蹈確是奇才，希特勒的狂妄表達無遣，可與「空軍監遇」中的納粹敬禮，並爲雙絕</p>
<p>金馬玉堂</p>
<p>西部野建起歌台舞榭，還是葉鳳黛卡珞的世界，　的「莎榮美」的　舞迄今余味猶存，極樂　拉摩的天下是太平洋上的島嶼，裏上沙籠，光艦照人，棕欄樹下，累歌一關，瑪麗蒙丹東施效　，總非其敵。到了西部，獻藝舞廳，天地人各皆不利便，披上黑紗，獨唱一歌，燈火明亮，四面是人，毫無情調，足以掩映出黑紗的神秘「印第安女郎」一塲，桃樂珊初試舞步，沒有「夜夜春落宵」那樣的特寫，媚力充以發揮，這塲舞不能勝　「沙漠情歌」的東方舞，女兵舞亦較「甜甜兒」遜色，靜夜泛舟時合唱的「你是彩虹」，最覺動聽，「光天化日吹上哨」一歌難好，比「彩鳳清歌」狄安娜實萍驅車高歌一節的Tempo　就著了。計算下來，只要桃樂珊平梳頭髮時的微笑依然可喜。狄克鮑惠爾歌喉不弱，但是幸好他能及早改變作風，「魔綱擒王」一片證明他的轉變前途無量。維多摩亞一謂老糊　相，宜　雷史藝爾頓之流唱雙簧。</p>
<p>導演喬治馬歇爾，平庸之至，甚至不及「彩鳳清歌」的羅勃地安，第一他不會利用桃樂珊拉摩的特點；第二他不懂歌舞塲面的圖案美，鏡頭只從正面角度推進，吊滯而少變化；第三他把歌塲面限於室內，錯過阿利宋娜州的野景。</p>
<p>長想思</p>
<p>「桃花潭水」的結尾是一面灰茫茫的玻璃門，寒冷赤裸，寂靜無聲，時間的分野，嚴化的身影抹過雲，那麼緩慢，透過玻璃上的凹凸點子，一顆顆淚珠似的，顯得毛滲滲地黑影停住了，慢慢轉過來，還是那麼靜，那麼慘淡，好一會兒這身影又抹過雲，不見了。這個塲面與「　夢重溫」的玻璃門鏡頭不約而同，但「桃花潭水」更爲潔沉，導演何兆璋可以爲此自傲·「長想思」中末尾高跟鞋上樓一段簡介有力，參用「蝴蝶夫人」樂曲配音，果然聰明，偌長的故事，淪陷時期上海屋簷下的小景，太迷糊了，沾上我們以往的夢魔，一起退後去，劫的風沙，人們只要一種溫暖，聯空時候的果然晒台上塵夢，有點寒意，郤是淚水裏的　意比起勝利以後，光明竟是悲劇了。可惜何兆璋僅這兩點可取，余則散漫，累贅，防空介紹水桶等鏡頭太多，形同新聞宣傳片，無塲歌唱亦不自然，佈景中的衣星恰如狗眼，令人啼笑難分，編劇沒有中心，創陣痕跡顯然可見了。獨有周旋最佳，好的溫馨，嫵媚，比她的歌喉更覺可喜，久看西片，我對國片便少好感，惟對周旋仍然推許，舒適，演盲母的和黃宛蘇都可以，白沉及他人面貌就看不順眼。</p>
<h3>評「女人與和平」</h3>
<p>— 葉聯薰</p>
<p>在我沒有看「女人與和平」以前，我以爲李健吾先生祇是一個能寫「不這還是春天」「金小玉」這樣浪漫色彩底作家。當我看完了「女人與和平」，我覺得李健吾先生並不是一個祇會寫爲「英雄與美人」的低能劇作家，他也是一位能夠站在時代前端，批判現實，暴露社會上課惡現象底進步　作家。</p>
<p>陳白塵的「陸官圖」，反映了政治腐敗的陰影，貪官污吏唯利是國的　態，然而在李健吾先生的「女人與和平」裏，我們却看到了戰爭把人類當作砲灰的殘酷，骨肉流離的　慘，政治腐敗，經濟　潰下的苛捐　稅，女人過剩，男人奇缺的不合理底現象。</p>
<p>「女人與和平」有故事是一個　話，然而却不是一個美麗的童話，它不像「牛郎織女」這樣地把的陶醉在粉紅色的幻想裏，它是一個充滿了警惕和批判的神話，這神話使我們想到戰爭的可佈，人類自想殘殺的無聊，和平的可貴，同人害那種應該被矯正的可憐又可笑底「喜劇」。</p>
<p>有人說「女人與和平」這樣形式的作品，祇是劇運低潮過程中，賣弄嗜頭底作品，他沒有像陳白康的「結婚進行曲」那樣的嚴重而帶着人情味，然而我以爲一個劇作家，祇要他否定了社會上腐敗的現象，他是可以不擇一切底手段和形式，去表現他的主題和情節，因爲劇劇不是單純地　要完整底形式，而主要的還是這個作品的內容是否有對現實的人生起着矯正底效果。因此像「女人與和平」這樣的作品，雖然　的人物沒有像「結婚進行曲」中主人公那樣的現實，他多少還帶着一些神話的色彩，還有那種「浮誇」的缺點，但是祇要他的內容已達到了戲劇矯正人生的任務，我們還是應該說他是一個好戲。</p>
<p>陳白塵「結婚進行曲」，祇提出一個嚴重的問題，然而他却沒有去解決問題，而「女人與和平」的作者，他雖然也喊出了爭取和平的口號，然而他却運用了男人的反動來擊敗嗜殺成性的戰神，顯然前者祇是一個提出問題的戲劇，而後者是一個久負盛名的「舵手」，這底價「女人與和平」得到他導演，無疑地是「錦上添花」，地位的勻稱，手法的　　，構力的美麗，這決非一個普通庸俗的導演所能　得到，尤其是第三幕結尾的大塲面，這演能夠處置得這樣有條不紊，實在是非常的不容易。</p>
<p>值得一提的倒是這歲的舞蹈和歌唱，前才的簡單而切全「戲劇」的動作，和後者那種利用民間歌調的歌詞，它給觀衆帶來了不少親切底感覺。</p>
<p>這個戲的裝置也是相當使人滿意的，第一幕裝置運用斷牆殘壁來顯示戰爭後房屋的被毀壞，在第二幕「貴人關」裝置又利用了卡通的手法來表示這是陰曹地府，而最後一幕裝置又增加了「房子的淺景」不斷地升起，來表示和平且不斷地建築，又恢復了過完去的繁榮，這是相當得裝置配合「劇情底發展」的。</p>
<p>演員方面沈揚的皮鞋匠，是最成功的一個，唸詞富於節奏，動作的善於抓取喜劇效果，實在是一個不可多得的喜劇演員，其次陳青的壯丁更林的會長，也都有很好的成就。</p>

<h3>假如飛機在海面失事</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>自從中國和中央兩航空公司四架飛機失事，乘客死亡百除人，接着遠東　空公司的呂宋小姐號也失事了，幸虧遠束航空公司的飛機有海面救生設備，所以祇有極少數乘客死亡，飛機失事旣然這樣多，倘在戰時一定要疑神疑鬼，說是有間諜破壞，的確，如果有人把一　砂十或一撮砂糖放在發動機的傳動部分，還能不中途發生故陣嗎，現在不見得有問諜從中破壤，所以不是歸咎於飛行員技術不良，就得推諉於氣候惡劣，總之飛行員假如摔死了，也就死人無對證，氣候在外行看也是難以捉模的東西，即使賢明如包孝肅的檢察官，也無法把氣候之神，抓來審問一番的。</p>
<p>旅客對於飛機難免引起懷疑，而有談虎色變之概，其實航空運輸主持得當，是非常安全的，就以呂宋小姐號，在海面失事而論，因處置得法，犧牲成分極小，如果換了旁的航空公司，那全部旅客豈不要寃沉海底，我們決不能因為一兩家航空公司因主持不得其人而對於一切航空公司和一切飛機的安全性發生懷疑，因而放棄乘坐飛機的權利，但在坐上飛機之先，一定要明白失事時的應急步驟，搭坐外國海面航行之飛機，乘客均有救生橡皮背心一件，使用時將拴子拔開，壓縮氣體就把橡皮背心充實，在海面可以沉不下去，飛機機　上方夾艙內有橡皮救生船兩隻，划槳，無綫電信號機，獵槍釣魚鈎及糧食醫藥品都有充分的配備，在飛機發生故障時，飛行員發出棄機的通知或警號，乘客切勿慌張亂動，一定要等到飛機在海面强迫降落，大概在一二分鐘之內是不會沉沒的，那一二分鐘的時間儘够全部乘客逃至機翼上面，海上是非常冷冽的，所以在海面飛行的人，一定要多穿棉衣，不透水的允妙，先達到機翼的人，將救生船拉出，拔去栓子，壓縮氣體把橡皮船充實了，那時飛機已有逐漸下沉之勢，後出的乘客不妨跳在海裏，抓住救生船旁的繩索，有時在匆遽之間把救生船放反了，船底朝天，那大家得設法把牠翻過來，方法是由力大者壓住船的一邊，使牠的另一邊撓起來，那就可以把牠翻過來了，在救生船上飄流的日子無定，從數日至四五十日，預備的糧食有限，至多可充一星期之用，而且以罐食等緊縮乾糧為限，並有小量淡水，在海上最難忍受的事有好幾件，第一件是白天的太陽光，把你炙得皮膚佳脫，雖然救生船上有一個小篷帆司用，但實在遮不了無情的烈炎，由熱炙而引起的第二件事就是口渴了，起初還有淡水司飲，迨淡水用完，就得等候天上的雨露，但這種期待是沒有把握的，不論如何口渴，切不可飲海水，那會使你愈加口渴的，有些乘客口渴得寗可跳在海裏淹死，第三件是飢餓，乾糧旣極有限，即使節制使用，也過不了幾天，以後就得釣魚來吃，海魚是可以生吃的，據我的飛行敎官說。他在海面漂流過四十二天，完全靠生魚活命，普通人在海面活不到那麼久，身體壞的，水裏浸上一二天就死了。</p>

<h3>一定保險</h3>
<p>— 聞遲</p>
<p>前些天，　中失事特多，如果旅客個個保過旅運險，那麽保險公司就要大賠其款。我以爲這種保險業務，確實頗宜提倡·然而我得聲明，並不是替什麼保險公司招攬生意；有些人以為「死者已矣」，賠到了錢又如何呢？這當然要看各人的處境。死者固然巳矣，可是有些死者還有家屬，却並不已矣。航空公司又把中國人的身價壓得比外國人低，在我看來，是　　提出抗議的。死者固然已矣，可是我舞終究是中國人哪！怎么　？還是　　處處？</p>
<p>不過航空公司方面還能負一責任，比起別的地方來，則又　　一籌了。</p>
<p>在中國的旅運事業，從飛機到出險的事。例如前些時有　　路交口大覆車案，死者的家屬　還在和前路局局長陸福廷打官司；至於汽車失事，抗戰後方司空見慣，全軍覆滅，或者安全到達，都是聽天由命；火輪方面，也　有內河小輪爆汽缸等慘劇新聞在　上出現，而失了事大都不負什麽責任。諸如此類，使人想到中國人的旅行實在太無保障，令人慄慄危懼。</p>
<p>我覺得我們一方面應請政府嚴令所有掌握交通工具的國營機關或私營企業機構，切實負起旅運安全責任，並且明定一種合理的賠償辦法，一個企業只有賺路，却對於賠償責任輕輕卸掉，那么實在是太「得其所哉」了。另一方面，我覺得凡是旅行者，凡如認為必要，還是保險的好，至於因公出差，出事公私機關事後或有一筆撫卹金，可是往往其數量足以令人啼笑皆非，我覺得倒不如先撥一部份專門小款子，為出差旅行人員投付保費。撫卹，保險與賠償，三方面都有責任。而現在我們還只看到航空公司付給酸溜溜的一百萬元什麽費，予死者家屬，眞是無限感槪：何不幸生為中國人！</p>
<p>「買肉搭脚爪」</p>
<p>前幾天在錫滬公路蘇常綫走了一决，碰到了一件意外的事。蘇常汽車票價是三千六百元，但是買票時必須要付出三千八百元，售票員才肯從窗洞中塞一張車票給你，這另外的二百元，是搭售一個什麽公司的「旅運意外保險單」。俗語云：「買肉搭脚爪」，意謂買肉買得多一點，經過同意，搭隻把脚爪可以不另付錢，是一種老例。而買車票搭買保險單却還是初次看到。但硬要你付錢保火險，兵險，人壽險，旅運險，種種花樣，是一個保險公司的各種業務部門。承保者收到少量保費，如其出險，就要付出一大筆保款，原算得公平交易，老無欺。願來保則保，不願來保也不能到街上硬拉。</p>
<p>可是蘇常路上的搭頭辦法，則簡直硬做，不保也得保，否則就不賣車票給你，讓你行不得也。因此走上這條路便「一定保險」。</p>
<p>老實說，蘇常路短短六十華里，汽車道路都好，開一萬趟車不知會不會有一决所謂「意外」，或弄得旅客「死亡或殘廢」。所以旅客不保險則己，來保則「穩吃」賺錢。做「穩吃」賺錢的事，當然誰都願意，不過這種「一定保險」的辦法實在大有問題。我以為保險事業，在中國還待各方推動，提倡，這實在是一宗頗有意思的事業。「一定保險」的事情是做不得的，你要「穩吃」，但是客人不吃，人情法理也都不吃。「一定保險」變成「硬要保險」，「硬做」，「穩吃」。小處着手，大處着眼，中國保險事業的推進，主持者應該多多動些腦筋，少打「穩吃」算盤，使人自動一定保險，才是辦事業者應有的態度，否則便不大上流了。</p>
<h3>「新正」難過</h3>
<p>— 友楨</p>
<p>舊歷新正，跑到親友家裏，你不說拜年，他會先喊恭喜；由是乎，相互恭喜發財一番，千篇一律，俗不可耐；雖明知這是陋習，却限於人「情」與「面」子，不能不「禮尙往來」一下。由是乎，舊規陋俗，牢不可破！年復一年，誰也抵抗不了。</p>
<p>接着，傭人先生，笑嘻嘻地端了一杯茶出來，杯旁附加兩隻橄攬，橄欖原為「苦盡甘來」之象徵，總算吉利的東西，並不令人討厭；可是，在習俗，橄攬者元寳也，元寳者「招財進寳」也，主人的意思，大家發財，而傭人的意思，則招客人之財也。到了此時，儘管你口袋空虛，見了這兩顆靑果，便無法不袖出鈔票，賞給傭人；不然的話，總覺得怪難為情的！</p>
<p>因此，難過的年關倒已過云了，而發財的「新正」却真難過！許多親親友友，不去賀一賀「年」要挨　，云賀一賀「年」，却吃不消那兩顆「元寶」！</p>

<p>舊曆新正，上海　頭眞多，只要你花樣翻新，廣吿奇特，自會轟動上海人來觀看的。南京路新世界三樓，展覽兩頭怪嬰，看的人倒也也不少。該嬰有兩個頭，一個頭在在號，一個頭在甜睡，一個頭在大嚼，一個頭在呆看，一個頭在笑，一個頭在哭。他們在廣吿上說，不是看白相，有研究價値。這種變態，究竟是何理由，我不是生理學家，當然研究不出所以然來。</p>
<p>不過一面笑，一面哭的事情，在這畸形的動亂社會裹，不知多多少少？唉！兩頭怪嬰隨處有，這種變態何時休？</p>

<h3>艾德禮的一天</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>倘使你　　俗早晨到偷敦的聖傑姆斯公園去，你可以看見一對老夫婦緩步而行。趕上去一看，原來那是艾德禮夫妻。這是首相開始一天前工作之前，夫妻兩人在作着早晨的散步。</p>
<p>艾德禮夫妻住在公園附近的唐寗街十號——英國首相的官邸。害寗街十號的房屋非常廣大，可是艾德證夫妻僅佔用它的上層，遇到公事上的需要時才使用下層。</p>
<p>首相起身很早，七時三十分已經離牀，在早餐席上閱讀晨報（泰晤士報，曼澈斯特保衛報和工黨的機關報每日導報）十後，到公園去散步。</p>
<p>散步歸來　十當夫妻二人散步回來之後，首相回到唐寗街十號的內閣辦公室開始工作，批閱需要他注意的電報和文件。如果沒有閣議（閣議的常會是每星期一十一時至一時，每星期四十時至一時舉行），訪客的在十時左右來訪。</p>
<p>訪客總是閣員，議員，首相擔任主席之委員會的委員，以及前來表示敬意的來賓。談話一直繼續到午餐時間。那通常是下午一時。艾德禮夫妻往往和工黨的領袖或來訪的聞人共進午餐。</p>
<p>每天下午一一時四十五分左右，首相到下院去聽取質問。他也許將留到舉行辯論，在這席上他必須發言，而到下院散會（有時竟遲到晚上的十點三十分）為止。</p>
<p>在下院時，首相接見許多議員，他從這裏接觸到國會對於當前問題的空氣。他的國會新聞秘書和新聞官員向他供應輿論。</p>
<p>處理公文　回到內閣辦公室的唐寗街十號，艾德禮又處理公文，電報和報告！一直到四點鐘，於是他停止工作，和夫人及女見用茶。到五點鐘，他又開始工作，接見訪客，召開委員會議，在文件上簽署，口授信件，直到七點鐘，於是進晚餐。</p>
<p>晚餐往往是官方的宴席，有聞名的訪客等共席。晚餐，咖啡，雪茄，和談話通常需要二小時。於是艾德禮又回去作一小時左右的工作。</p>
<p>和多數英國人一樣，首相也是一個板球迷，在這一切的會議及工作之間，他研究當天板球賽的結果。</p>
<p>重視後進　在唐寗街十號的訪客中，往往有年靑的工黨議員，他們在國會工作中曾表示有充分希望。艾德禮經常閱　國會紀錄，並且密切注意年靑的議員，他們的演說表示他們具有於工黨及英國有利的才幹和思想。這是首相用以接觸有升為閣員之資格的人才的一種方法。</p>
<p>當首相在家中時，他最喜歡的消遺是偵探小說，同時他也喜歡古典詩，並且他還帶着一本手册，把目己的詩句寫下來。雖然他並不反對，但是他不喜歡現代詩。</p>
<p>自從担任首相以來，因爲缺乏時間，艾德禮不得不放棄他做木王的好癖了。</p>

<h3>雲林歲朝書畫展</h3>
<p>— 徐仲年</p>
<p>雲林書畫社（呂班路四十號）主人楊愷齡先生，於一月二十一日（夏曆丁亥年元旦）至三十日，在該社開「歲朝圖」及書法展覽會。筆者於夏曆年初二，前往參觀，拜年，並參加粥會，飽取精神食糧與實物食糧而歸。</p>
<p>「歲朝圖」是一個老題目，眞可以說：數見不鮮。如果以「歲朝岡」爲主題，要開個展覽會，祇有兩條路可循：（一）取其「多」，予人以錯雜　紛，目不暇給之感；（二）取其「精」，在應時之外，自有其藝術價値。此次楊愷齡先生採取了第二條途徑：這是値得稱贊的。</p>
<p>會中所有的「歲朝圖」都由吳稚　先生題序。「歲朝圖」的主要作用在乎祝頌：福祿壽三項，吳稚老沒有一項不全的！八十三歲的高齡，嵩高淵博的智識，中外欽敬的令譽：接受「歲朝圖」的先生，祗須有幾分像吳稚老，我想，就可以自豪了罷！何况和吳先生合作的人都是名畫家，如：張大千，汪亞塵，馬超然，江寒汀，梅蘭芳，張君謀，鄭午昌，吳湖帆，陳定山，侯湘，秦淸曾，諸健秋，賀天健，徐育柳，秦古柳，顯坤伯，侯碧漪，唐湘冷諸先生：衆美俱，二難（畫及書）併，洋洋乎大觀哉！</p>
<p>書法的部門也不弱。吳稚暉，葉恭綽，沈尹默，潘伯鷹，張繼，陳其采，張默君，鄒魯，鈕永建，但懋辛，華士巽，侯湘，胡毅生，楊千里諸先生都是卓然大家。字體有瘦有肥，有剛有柔；有的人以字傳，有的字以人傳；有的身爲士人，不脫書生本色；有的躍馬疆塲，功成退隱，景從風雅。古人所謂：立德，立功，立言：參與書展的諸位均有所立。我們參觀的人，除了傾佩他們書法之外，對於各位的品操和功業，也懷有無限的敬意。</p>
<p>現今我隨意攝刊「歲朝圖」一幀，以示一斑。該圖由：張君謀繪梅，陳定山繪竹，鄭午昌繪松，江寒汀繪天竹，張大千繪芝草，梅蘭芳繪荸齊，汪亞塵繪雙柿，馮超然繪柏枝，吳稚暉題序。</p>
<p>卅六年一月廿四日，丁亥年初三，試筆。</p>
<h3>歲朝圖</h3>
<p>— 吳稚暉　張大千　汪亞塵　梅蘭芳　諸家合作</p>
<h3>現代繪畫之真實性</h3>
<p>— 關良</p>
<p>現代繪畫自從塞尙表現立體性以來，與其說當時的畫家們在標奇立異，追尋各色各樣的主題及表現的五花八門當中，母寗說是當時畫家們苦於十八九世紀一種外表傳統，而追求超脫，甚至找尋一種更活潑，更具有表現自我的自由型式的創造。當時自塞尙，哥根，馬締斯，畢加索，以至奇力哥，沙伐多，他們當時無論受着頑固守舊派批評家們的攻擊，以爲他們在放棄傳統的美的觀念中，也不過像達達者們的只求破壞，不事建設的胡鬧，然而事實却在證明藝術是創造，不只是追求先人的傳統爲滿足。事過二十餘年的今日看來，他們那時激烈地對新藝術的建設，不是白費的，而是遺留在整個現代繪畫史上更多燦爛和綺麗的花朶。</p>
<p>有人以爲新的藝術總是難以理解；因爲其難於理解，也就只有冷漠視之，甚至毀謗隨之了。新的繪畫在否定了十八九世紀外表的傳統以來，其最可寳貴的是精神和新的眞實性，野獸羣的畫家佛拉芒克在他的靜物和風景畫中不單是表現了主題色和質的皓肖，甚至他拿鹽和糖來做比喻，同是一堆白色的東西，而應該表現出來他是一種代表鹹的，一種代表甜的。由此可見當時的野獸羣畫家們對眞實性的認眞，現代繪畫的眞實性不單是一面的而應是多面的，例如，「視覺的眞實性」，「感覺的眞實性」，以及形而上的眞實性，都可爲一個很好的例子。在視覺的眞實性言，不單畫家們表現一種主題以表現「像」爲滿足，更從「像」之中找出比渦像還重要的因素，那即是說，例如人體應該是一種血肉之驅，而表現血肉之軀之外，其更重要的是生命。要那生命如何地更加活躍地呈顯在畫面，那同時還應附以不可缺的情感。當。當情感支配着畫面的時候，甚至可以放萊外表的形態，在變形中甚且還能得到更豐富的畫面的這類的作品以馬締斯，多蘭，哥根，佛拉芒克等可爲代表，至若感覺的眞實性，畫家們於追求色彩調和之外，形態變形之外，是一種表現當時情緖的眞實感，這相似人們的初戀的生活中，初嚐親吻時飄飄欲仙的一種感覺，將這感覺直截地描到畫面去，而收到超越了視覺眞實性的效果，這例作家奇力哥等可爲代表。</p>
<p>在形而上的眞實性中，那羣曾被命爲畫壇怪物的超現實主義作家們可爲代表。超現實主義者們，認爲人在日常生活中的思索之外，在不可知的時日中支配着生活的仍有幻想，和夢的一種生活，在自己的幻想或是夢境，直截的，描成畫面。繪畫，在他們以爲能表現日常可視的生活，又那有不能描寫日常不可視而比現實生活更可貴的部份呢！新的繪畫目從趨現實主義發現以來，不單是像八們未曾看過美怪的花朵，同時給新繪畫的領域從有限擴展到無限，帶現代繪畫進入無窮角度和視野。最近的超現實主義者們。從單是詩趨的題材擴展到政治和社會的主題上去，他們認爲，人類以言語文字傳達思想之外，那麽人們的幻像和夢境也至少有共通的共鳴點，共同的眞實性，拿這些作爲題材，也未必是不可懂的東西了。這類的畫家，有現居美國的沙伐多利，米羅可代表。</p>
<p>總之，現代繪畫目塞尙以後至畢加索，達利等不單在短短的二十年代擴展了前人幾世紀也夢想不到的領域，對傳統美的否定以來，從各派別中創造出了更擴大的美的觀點。繪畫不只是主題物的再現，而是主題物的創造。</p>
<h3>一個菲律濱作家的自述</h3>
<p>— 卜魯遜作　彭思衍譯</p>
<p>當我自傳發表以後，接到許多信件都以「我如何變成作家」的問題來相詢。他們要知道，一個未經正式訓練的人如何能够寫出愉快而富有刺激性的作品。他們也要知道，一切關於促成我從事寫作事業的因素。</p>
<p>解答這些問題是很困難的，因爲一個作家的成功，是須經過較長的程序和精緻的磨鍊才能達到的。當我來到美國的時候，我從未想到我會成爲一個作家。我回想由家鄉啓程來美的那一天，對美國這個地方腦筋褒僅現呈一幅模糊不淸的印象而已。那裏會想到在美國得到如是的幸運。同時我不太明瞭自己求知的確切原因。不過在我潛意識的深處確存着一種反抗緊迫我童年時代的惡劣環境的熱情。也因爲這個原因，即毅然決然地遠離了我的祖國。</p>
<p>可是這種的「反抗」又跟我來到？美國——當然我不認爲這種反抗是孕育在我的自身——我常常在我朋友中發見很多的過失。因此我開始感覺我已由低級的標準而走向與美國良心相抵觸的局面了。而且在苦悶中我唯一避免激怒的方法就是「跑」。所以這十年來我老實過着漂泊而恐懼的生活。從朱和平，安定於一時。結果因逃避恐懼反而走入恐懼的深淵。這幾乎使我不想再活下去了。這種恐懼的感覺直至認識「反抗」是孕育在自己本身時爲止。其實恐懼就是我意識的一部分，那個時候我開始尋求擺脫恐懼的方法了。</p>
<p>首先我們要明瞭恐懼的性質，什麽帶來了恐懼，什麼把恐懼養成如此可怕的程度。是因爲我被人驅往阿拉斯加，在不良的工作環境下，而幹牛馬般的工作，致使我心頭現示可怕的影子嗎？或者是因爲我到達加里福尼亞時，被人拒絕進入敎堂及痛見「人魂販子」在支配宗敎信仰而生恐</p>
<p>其實我有生以來感覺到最恐懼的還是下述的幾次；第一次；在舊金山公共汽車站時，我全神正爲一個美國漂亮女人所吸引住，當時不料就有一個白色人予我難堪的打擊，事後我很慚愧爲什麼不能以下列的語調駁斥他呢：難道人類的美麗是美國人的特產嗎這種罪惡的感覺實使我不能一時忘懷；相反的更鼓起我讚美的勇氣。同時我始終認爲美麗是屬每個人的，而不是屬於某一種族或某一階級的。因此我就完全由長期纏繞的恐懼中解脫了。其次，有一天當我到公共圖書館自修的時候，街上有人指着我大笑，起初我不認爲他們是嘲笑我。及至鏡前自看週身，才知道他們所笑的我褲襠上的破洞那時我心裏很難過。其實我每天那個時候到圖書館去讀書已達六個月了，而且所穿的衣服都是這一套。因爲我全神都注意書本的嘉州言懿行，而忘却人類間還有服飾的講究，及至那天傍晚即潛至賭塲中去飲「揩油茶」</p>
<p>的確，這些恐懽，羞恥和飢餓的年頭，我是孤寂的；幾乎好幾年沒有和人類（甚至和單獨個人）接觸過，也沒有聽過女人嬌嫩的聲間。有一天的深夜，我從夢中驚醒，用冰冷的被蓋撫摩着自己的臉部，那時我實在渴望人類的撫愛。過幾年後果然遇着一個女人，她確是把我帶到真正世界的邊緣，而且也使我遭遇着美國種族歧視的恐懼。因爲她的父親用冷酷的語調對我說：「你們菲律濱人根本不是人類，不配與我女兒談愛情」。</p>
<p>「愛情」是白種人特有的產業嗎？「愛情」是屬於種族嗎？美國人的父親爲什麽犯如此的錯誤呢？唉！淸水實較男女間的愛情來得更慈悲，鴿子實較人類間的愛情來得更忠實，螞蟻在她社會中的建設，實較我舞私有制度的世界來得更完善啊！</p>
<p>這樣剝奪我做人類的權利，我開始過着像森林中的禽默生活。其實在世風日下的「社會式森林」裏又何嘗沒有更多兇惡的禽獸。所以我不忍再見這樣的人類生活。我曾經這樣想：如果能眞正變爲禽默而不受所謂「人道」的拘束，那是最好不過的。</p>
<p>但有人帮助我奔出黑暗而走向光明，所以我可以寫寫關於我們在森林中生活實情的作品。這種寫作的動機完全是在暴露我菲律濱人生活在美國的罪惡。其實也是暴露生活在「社曾式森林」裏的幾百萬人的罪惡。然後我希望在這暴露的文字裏可以發揮一</p>
<p>我對於美國的情形非常明療，對於美國民主淵源也相當熟悉，所以我深恐美國民主前途爲錢，權三勢三種勢力所斷送。因此我希望美國有一種能盡力貢獻其經騐爲歟千萬美國服務的作家，同時我也希望菲律濱也有一種能爲國人製造生活武器和希望的作家。唯有這樣的作家才有意義，才有機能。</p>
<p>以上就是我答覆一般人詢問我如何變爲作家的問題。本來作家之爲作家，不僅是爲了生活，而且要明瞭美國民主的要義，同時還要把它推動建立一種社會，使在這種社會裏不會再有種族的歧視，貧賤的藐視。那麽我們解放人類之一的目的就算達到了。（譯自The　Far　East</p>

<h3>美育與心理建設</h3>
<p>— 鄭午昌</p>
<p>追念提倡美育的蔡老師</p>
<p>美的認識，雖是出於人羣的太性直覺；因爲知識程度的高下，而發生不同的觀感；往往你以爲美，我却以爲不美；今天以爲美，明日反以爲不美；此地以爲美，別處則以爲不美。其閒似乎是很複雜而漫無標準的。因此，怎樣才算是眞正的美？先要有個定律。就是「美律」。鄙意以爲「美」，要合乎「眞理」，合乎「實情」，就是要「眞」，是一個律。旣眞了，還要迎合耳目之欣賞，你得心神之怡恍，就是「善」，是一個律。具此二律，無論是在製作上，行事上，都是美的——美術，美德。反面就是不講理，不合情，傷良心，害天理的，都是不美。古人說：「已所不欲，勿施於人；」「不奪人之所好。」人羣本一點良知良能，誰也不知道美，誰也不知道美的可愛。不施人以不欲，不辱人之所好，就是合於情理，也就是「眞」；於是人我兩相怡恍，便是一善」；不是美德麽？盡參造化，師自然，是美術，但畫遠樹大於近樹，在風雨中張帆，就是不合情理，也就是不「眞」；使人見了不合眼，不樂眼，就是不「善」；也得算是美術麼？由此推演，所謂美育，不難有相當的標準了。其實美育的工作及其功效，很普遍而久遠的在人類社會中，緊握着無上的權威。比如男子的衣冠枝履，女子的脂粉珠翠，官家的宮院儀仗，商人的門面廣吿，宗敎的建築圖像，上而制禮作樂，下而尋花問柳，無不借美的感化和誘惑，去迎合人羣愛美性來達到他所要求的目的；也可以說凡是政治家，宗敎家，敎育家，及其他社會學家，都不能不利用「美術」「美德」，來治國傳敎，移風易俗。</p>
<p>現在關心國事的賢達輩，都在高談要建設新的中國。他們的意思，或是因爲我們有數千年文化史的中國，到了現在，是崩潰了，落伍了，必須重新建設。不知所要建設的，還是建設得和美國英國蘇俄一樣，就算是新呢？還是要比他們更新一點。就算是新？我以爲新也好，舊也好，只要「美」。心理建設，比物質建設重要得多；禮義廉恥，忠孝仁愛，這是我們中國舊有的美德，也可以說是歷萬古而常新的，現在可是眞沒落了！我們應該從國人心理中喚醒過來。國人心理上，有了美德的建設，一切政治，敎育，軍事………才能合理順情，而上軌道；至於工業，商務等，也不難有適應現代實際情勢的建設。如果動輒會汚，動則鬥爭，動則腐化，和美律背道而馳，什麽都沒有建設的希望。所以我現在更迫念提倡</p>
<p>蔡老師孑民曾經提倡「美育來代替宗敎」。一時相與吶喊的，頗不乏人；到了現在，簡直沒有人說起了。這種偉大而崇高的啓迪，尤其是在現代的中國社會，不過承認她是一句名言，不設法去發揚光大·使他事實化，不但辜負光覺，實在是吹滅了民族文化運動前程的明燈。</p>
<p>任何宗敎的存在，無非握着人類共同本有的一種情，理，性，做根據，演編敎義經典，廣事感化，使不失本有的情，理，性，而成佛得道，脫罪昇天。但其中，未免要假借神說鬼話，施用迷惑手段。至於美育，只有一個「美」字來做敎育的信條。比較光明着實。因爲人類無論　愚賢不，可以說都是愛美的。愛肖美是人的夭性，我們就握着這種愛美性；一方面就來發揮美的精神，提高美的程度，增加美的價値，推廣美的效用，同時培養美的欣賞，引起美的愛好。了解美的功能。具有愛美性的人羣，不時受着美的陶養感化，於是改革身心·變換氣質，乃至移風易俗，恐怕比受了洗禮或戒律的敎徒的奉行敎義，還覺自然，而易於信仰得多。</p>
<p>但是「美」是有美的「律」。不是好看悅目的，就是美；可愛鎖視的，就是美；自鳴得意，而被人豔羨的，就是美。世界人羣，忙忙碌碌，干祿求富，爭權奪利的，那一個不是爲求美的安慰，美的享受，來滿足他愛美性的慾望。但其結果，反而不美。這都是不知「美律」妄行追求，以致畫虎類犬，學道成魔，甚至如飛蛾投燄，到死不悟。這是多麽辜負天付人類以愛美性的好意！，要拯救爲愛美求美而走錯了路的人羣，所以要有「美的教育」。</p>
<h3>西洋畫史上的寫這精神　十六七世紀之風景畫</h3>
<p>— 沈雁</p>
<p>如果在西洋美術史上追尋風景畫發達之根源，則在古典時代亦可發見不少資料，取材於「歐德塞亞」之叙事詩或空想性的風景畫。在羅馬時代中可以發見綑貝住宅之室內裝飾，「令人想起日本襖畫。（註：襖與障紙相似，惟糊以特殊厚紙，上畫各種繪畫，兼室內裝飾之用）」直至基督敎時代之十五世紀義大利繪畫之背景中，多有具備風景畫構想之作品，因爲當時流行遠近法，描寫風景爲背景之風更盛。但是，出現純粹寫生之風景畫，開始將風景畫爲獨立作品之製作。十六世紀當時代表作，有維尼啻亞畫家吉爾吉歐尼美麗之壁畫，曁德國畫家丟拉之水彩畫。而雷歐納爾德之素描亦應特別舉出。雷納爾德素描中，有一羣恰如風景寫生之眞筆。惟其大部爲關於考察自然現象之備忘錄，而非純粹風景寫生，例如雨下山岳之風景爲描寫氣象現象之素描，描寫河水流域的爲流水現象之素描，而均爲關於地球物理學之觀察研究之紀錄。故在雷歐納爾德具體地研究生動的自然現象之純科學態度，與以科學敏感探求風光審美性之純藝術觀察，融合成不可分離之一體。因此他的素中可發見的好像風景畫的作品，係一種「科學」與「藝術」兩者融合之形態，與純粹的風景畫完全不同，但其于張至少可認爲風景素描，此一素描上著有一四七三年，研究風景畫歷史之學者頗重視此明記年代之資料。</p>
<p>殆與雷歐納爾德同一時期，完成德國繪畫之丟拉，亦留下一對優秀之水彩風景畫。此種風景畫美麗地描寫出當時德國地方色彩，這是頗令人回味的作品。自然風光之外，描寫民房的亦多。</p>
<p>吉爾吉歐尼傑出之風景畫，普通被稱爲「嵐」，爲一色彩美麗之純粹風景畫，背後天空之雲彩厚而暗，相反地樹木色彩濃而鮮麗。據云係描寫作者居住的卡斯特伏郞哥的地方色彩。據一部研究家解釋，該畫前景中之人物與傳說有關，但不如將此年靑而窮困的男女認爲點綴人物爲合適。而此後者解釋對於美術史上實有重大意義。因爲配合點綴人物的純粹風景畫，以一個「作品」姿態，由此始而出現。吉爾吉獸尼尙有「田園之合奏」一畫，此以人物描寫爲主，同不能認爲風景畫，惟吉爾吉尼爾對於描寫風景之優秀材能於此却表現無遺。</p>
<p>粽合以上一如述各種作品，僅爲個別散見之美麗史料而已。風景畫成爲繪畫中獨立之一部門而促成有系統之發達，實在次一時代（即十七世紀以後）。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在十七世紀的畫界有兩種系統的風景畫（一）爲「理想風景畫」，（二）爲「田園風景畫」，前者在法國發達，後者則在荷蘭勃興。大槪而論，前者爲根據宮廷文化需要而產生之系統，後者爲在市民文化氣氛中成熟之形式。惟據寫實性問題予以考察則尙多須主意之點。</p>
<p>當時在法國，在原則上尊重理想風景畫，而對於田園風景畫不承認其高度藝術性。其原因雖複雜，惟要點爲如下三點：當時法國繼承古典時代之神話傳說之環境描寫，再配合風景之義大利傳統，對向然風光亦較好於義大利風味之異鄉情調。因此藝術上的自然趨勢必在理想化的技巧上表現。當時法國曁義大利之社會所希求之庭園並非自然之橫做，而係顯著形式化的庭園。例如「凡爾賽」之廣大庭園可爲其代表，當時之王公貴族常遊於此種被構成圖案化之庭園中。因此，對於農民生活環境之田園風景，不承認任何藝術性，那是極可能的</p>
<p>但在此種情勢中寫實自然的傾向亦不少，因爲法國畫家本性向尊重寫實性，此種特徵在其繪畫中自然的表現出來；所以雖爲理想風景畫亦多含豐富的寫實性。例如法國繪畫鼻祖之尼克拉，勃生爲當時理想風景畫之代表作家，惟其點綴傳說人物之風景畫之背景却爲羅馬近郊之寫生。又加斯派爾勃生之繪畫，多有不包含任何傳說人物之純粹寫生畫，甚至其作品中可以發見能確實感覺羅馬近郊山岳地帶地方色彩之作品。</p>
<p>此種寫生傾向，在十八世紀之法國繪畫亦可明顯地看出。例如當代代表畫家昂特宛瓦特作品中，多有以貴族庭園爲背景，如「愛的宴會」其中描寫的樹木爲現實的寫生。及至十八世紀後半，例如代表古典主義黎明時期之風景畫家憂倍。羅培之作品，其大部爲描寫古典羅馬廢址之純粹寫生畫。</p>
<p>如以上各點在法國發達之理想風景畫，在其中多包含寫生要素的。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>荷蘭爲在十七世紀中葉離開西班牙而獨立之新興共和國宗敎亦爲新敎。色彩特別濃重，其社會制度以及民情習慣與法國迦異故其繪畫性質亦有其特徵。例如宗敎畫之速勃朗特作風好像將聖傳世界以平常日用語表示。又如法朗斯哈爾斯之肖像畫其中可以發見容易接近之日常表情·此種基本情調開闢以日常生活環境爲繪畫主題之新現象，於是創造獨自的鄕土風味之畫。日常生活環境之描寫，使繪畫範圍顯著擴大茲略述其情形如下：</p>
<p>（一）爲市民住房裏之生活環境描寫，雖爲一種風俗畫，惟其性質與普通一般的風俗畫截然不同，普通風俗畫對於材料表示某種程度之好奇，而强調特定情趣，但荷蘭繪畫則較此自然而平易，好似一副日常生活之斷片，爲將此種作品與普通風俗畫區別起見，稱爲「室內畫」，比較適當。</p>
<p>（二）如馬路上廣塲或公共建築物內部等，民衆集中之一定塲所，亦爲特殊主題。美術史家稱此爲「建築畫」，而承認其特殊性。</p>
<p>（三）靜物畫，以獨立一部門姿態出現於美術史上的亦始於當時荷蘭。此亦爲日常生活環境之特寫。惟常時之靜物畫未臻高度發達，靜物畫之完成應歸功於繼承荷蘭畫風而發揚光大之法國市民階級大畫家歇爾鄧，但是靜物畫歷史當時始於十七世紀之荷蘭。</p>
<p>如以上各述，在十七世紀之荷蘭，描寫日常生活環境之專門畫家多數出現，其作品多係小型畫。含有細輕風味，適當於掛在市民住房內而予以鑑賞。在此種情形下之荷蘭，出現田園風景畫家，以田園爲描寫生活環境之主題，以供應當時社會需要，亦爲勢所必然。</p>
<p>在荷蘭發達之田園風景畫，其取材範圍廣，形式亦有種種。槪括而論則有如下特徵：</p>
<p>（一）與上述「建築畫」相似，描寫包含建築物在內之地域風景。</p>
<p>（二）描寫以牲畜曁牧童爲點綴之田園風景，其中有寗可認爲動物畫者。</p>
<p>（三）以各種人物爲中心描寫田園風景其中包含頗似風俗畫者在內。</p>
<p>（四）描寫海邊風景，其中以帆船爲中心者居相當多。</p>
<p>（五）以樹木爲主描寫自然環境</p>
<p>（六）描寫天空雲彩效果者。</p>
<p>七，配合風車或農民房屋以描寫田園風趣者，其中亦有以農房爲主者。</p>
<p>以上所述各種構成要素，被隨意配合，以發生種種變化，作家亦槪爲平均地優秀。換言之，田園風景畫家之一般水準相當高，作家數亦不少。在此多數作家中，魯易斯達爾比較著名，惟特別傑出者當推連勃朗特；此人爲當時畫宗敎畫之唯一作家，同時肖像畫，風俗賽亦不壞。且以風景畫家亦頗出名，連勃朗特精通油彩畫法技巧，以此技巧對於田園風景畫增加圓滿豐富之氣氛。要之，十七世紀爲繪畫史上劃出新領境之一個時代。</p>

        <h1>1947.01.26</h1>
<h3>Government Reorganization Plan Still in Initial Discussion Phase; Lei Zhen Visits Shanghai Again to Consult with Various Parties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The capital has been experiencing continuous rain and snow. Discussions regarding peace talks and government reorganization have both stalled. Lei Zhen traveled to Suzhou on the 24th and then to Shanghai, but there have been no further activities.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Lei Zhen, the Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, will arrive in Shanghai this morning to consult with the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Democratic League on matters regarding the reorganization of the government. According to insiders, it is likely that various parties will participate in the government through collective action. This would present a fresh image both domestically and internationally. The possibility of a single party joining the government is quite slim. Furthermore, the scope of the government reorganization is also a key point. The various parties not in power attach considerable importance to participating in local governments. Another important consideration for each party is whether they can seamlessly cooperate with lower-level government personnel after participating in the government.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] When Shao Lizi was asked by reporters on the 25th about the rumors that the government would be reorganized on February 1st, he replied, "February 1st is a new era, the lunar calendar. The lunar calendar even has a February and a leap month, so this year there are three first days of February. Which one are you referring to?"</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] On the 25th, reporters visited the American ambassador to seek his personal opinion on the prospects for peace talks and government reorganization. The ambassador smiled and nodded repeatedly, saying, "I have no opinion. I won't say anything." When reporters inquired about the content of his previous meeting with Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic League, the ambassador replied, "We talked about many issues." When asked if it involved the Democratic League's participation in the government reorganization, the ambassador replied, "This is China's internal affair, and I cannot say anything." When reporters further asked whether the government's determination to reorganize in the shortest possible time would be good or bad, the ambassador said, "I have no opinion."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 25th] According to sources close to the government, although the government's reorganization has been decided, the set date is still too early. The main purpose of the reorganization is to share power with all parties, including the Communist Party, thereby breaking the current political deadlock. If the opposition parties continue to maintain a lofty attitude, then the reorganization will be meaningless. The participation of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party depends on the outcome of consultations between the two parties in Shanghai, but overall, optimism is possible. Chairman Zhang Qun of Sichuan Province is about to return to the province to handle some political affairs. The duration of this trip is unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting at Fanwei at 3:00 PM yesterday. Wu Xianzai, Wan Renqian, Xu Chuanlin, and the Standing Committee members in Shanghai attended. Chairman Zhang Junmai first reported on the detailed process of the negotiations with government representatives in Nanjing. This was followed by a discussion of the policies that the Democratic Socialist Party should adopt in the current situation after the breakdown of peace talks, as well as the basic principles for participating in the government. Due to differing opinions during the meeting, no concrete decisions were made. It was decided to continue discussions this morning.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 25th] Government authorities claim that the government's reorganization may not begin on February 1st as planned. The reorganization plan is still in the initial stages of discussion. It is thought that there will not be any continued development in the next three to five days before the end of the month.</p>
<h3>CCP Launches Propaganda War; Sets Guidelines for Political and Military Propaganda</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] A reporter has learned from relevant sources that the "Propaganda Department of the Central Political Bureau of the CCP" has issued propaganda guidelines for the 36th year of the Republic, totaling over 10,000 words. Excerpts of the more important points are as follows: (1) Because Communism has lost public faith in both rural and urban areas, it should henceforth be referred to as "Democracy" to facilitate propaganda. (2) Propaganda regarding "Marxism-Leninism" should also be stopped in the current situation. To suit the environment, facts should be sought to support the Three Principles of the People, and Sun Yat-sen should be used to win people's faith. (3) The activities of "militia" and "guerrilla units" in various places should be renamed "civil unrest movements." It is reported that these propaganda guidelines have been issued to CCP propaganda organizations across the country for strict implementation. Furthermore, a dispatch from Chongqing on the 25th stated that a certain individual close to the Xinhua Daily said that the CCP Central Propaganda Department, in order to control military news, specifically sent a telegram to Xinhua News Agency branches and journalists across the country on the 7th of this month, instructing them on the following matters that should be noted in future military news reports: Recently, newspapers have published many facts that expose our weaknesses and undemocratic propaganda, which should be corrected urgently. Therefore, the following ten points should be given special attention in the future: (1) Ideologically, it should be determined that our news work should seize the opportunity to work on the psychology of the general public, and fulfill propaganda responsibilities independently. (2) Every military news report, regardless of its success or failure, should first be measured for its benefit to our side. Any military secrets must not be published under any circumstances. (3) For every battle, the battle results on our side should be reported as much as possible. Even if we are forced to retreat, it should be framed as exchanging for value. Battle results can be expanded in propaganda to make society doubt the strength of the "stubborn army." (4) Anything that indirectly exposes our military secrets must not be published. In order to implement the above, it is necessary that: (a) Information on battle situations must be approved by the local command before it can be released. (b) Local military leaders must review every military news report before it is published. However, in the future, the propaganda department should take the initiative, as propaganda is indeed a weapon of war.</p>
<h3>Democratic League's Participation in Government Denied by Zhang Dongsun</h3>
<p>Restoration of Peace Talks Also Impossible</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Democratic League held a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday, during which it extensively discussed internal organizational personnel matters and the selection of heads of valley areas. However, as these matters are confidential, they will not be released to the public. As for the working policy, it was decided to work hard in accordance with the political declaration. Regarding the stalled peace talks, both sides are too far apart, and there is no capacity to mediate. As for reorganizing the government, it is not even considered for discussion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Secretary-General Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic League yesterday denied rumors that some members of the Democratic League would also participate in the government. He said that the Democratic League's internal opinions are consistent, and it is impossible for anyone to participate in the government alone. When reporters asked him whether the government had responded to the Democratic League's three prerequisites for resuming peace talks, he replied, "The government is trying its best to do well in this regard." He believes that there is no possibility of restoring peace talks in the short term regarding the prospects of the overall situation.</p>
<h3>US Immigration Bureau in San Francisco Detains Overseas Chinese Going to the US</h3>
<p>Including Lin Yutang's Daughter</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 24th] Lin Yutang's daughter and the daughter of Li Jun, a consultant to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were detained on board a ship by the US Immigration Bureau upon their arrival in the United States. After negotiations by Zhang, the Chinese Consul General in San Francisco, they were released on bail of $500. Prior to this, the Chinese ambassador had sent a letter requesting consideration of diplomatic etiquette, but it was not effective. The two young ladies will be traveling to Washington and New York within days. Consul General Zhang said afterward, "Everything has been resolved smoothly. The Immigration Bureau personnel probably do not know who Lin Yutang is. Only educated people know his name. The Immigration Bureau personnel are probably not educated, but I had no problems."</p>
<h3>General Budget</h3>
<p>To Be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The National General Budget for the 36th year of the Republic has been delivered to the Legislative Yuan. It is reported that the Yuan is preparing to begin the review within days. It is also reported that the 313th regular meeting of the Yuan has been scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 30th, and the discussion of the Banking Law and other cases will continue.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Local Apportionment of Donations; Executive Yuan Promulgates Five Supplementary Measures</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan recently promulgated five "Supplementary Measures Prohibiting Local Apportionment of Donations" as follows: (1) The expenses required for central and provincial affairs should be allocated with special funds by the entrusted agency for verification and issuance. (2) If new local undertakings need to be carried out after the budget is approved, a supplementary budget should be legally processed first and submitted for approval before they can be carried out. (3) All non-statutory collection agencies shall not directly collect any money or goods from the people. Even if it is a statutory collection agency, it shall not collect illegal taxes or apportioned funds from the people. Violators shall be dealt with in accordance with criminal law. (4) If county magistrates and mayors condone, harbor, or fail to supervise illegal apportionments of subordinate grassroots administrative institutions, they shall be jointly liable after verification of people's complaints. (5) If any county government, township, or pao-chia personnel arbitrarily apportion local funds, the people may list the facts and evidence and directly submit them to the provincial government or the central government. After verification, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Play Troupe Among Companions; Possible Reason for Detention</h3>
<p>Our Embassy Has Not Yet Received a Report</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] When the "General Gordon" ship arrived in San Francisco, Lin Yutang's daughter and Li Jun's daughter, a consultant to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, were detained along with other Chinese passengers. The Chinese Embassy here today stated that the matter was likely a misunderstanding. The State Department said that it had not received any protests regarding this incident. The Chinese Embassy believes that the Chinese play troupe on board may be the reason why all Chinese passengers were detained, as the play troupe required a special bond. However, people like the two young ladies Lin and Li should not be prevented from landing. The embassy has not yet received a report from Consul General Zhang in San Francisco.</p>
<h3>Giant Plane Flies Out of the Philippines; Rumored to Have Crashed in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Carrying US$15 Million</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 25th Broadcasting: A C-47 aircraft took off from Manila today bound for Hong Kong and Shanghai and has now gone missing.

<p>[Further Dispatch] Small groups of Communist forces have been acting up in recent days near Quantou Station (150 kilometers north of Shenyang) on the Sino-Chang Railway. Lianhua Village, 35 li southeast of Quantou, was occupied by Communist forces on the night of the 21st. The self-defense corps and villagers guarding the village mostly fled to Quantou Station. Currently, 4,000 Communist troops are gathering in the area, with the vanguard at Laoye Ridge, 15 li south of Quantou.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 25th] The National Army outside Dalian is currently carrying out clearing operations between Pulandian and Fuzhou Bay. The Communist forces on Boji Island south of Songmu Island have retreated to five uninhabited islets and will be driven away again by the National Army. In this way, the money line from Piziwo in the east, through Pulandian, to Fuzhou Bay in the west, has been completely controlled by the National Army, completing the blockade line across the Liaodong Peninsula.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 25th] Soviet troops are currently stationed on the Dalian Islands before and after Boji Island.

<h3>Fierce Fighting South of Baoding</h3>
<p>Communist Forces Besiege Dingxian Station</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Fighting is fierce south of Baoding. Xidian Station, north of Xinle and south of Dingxian, fell again on the 24th.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Zheng Jiemin, the government member of the Military Mediation Department, flew from Beiping to Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 25th. General observation suggests that Zheng's trip may be related to the impending closure of the department.</p>
<h3>British Labour MP Lindsay's Remarks are a Misconception; Minister Peng Responds to Foreign Reporters' Inquiries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] When reporters inquired with Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei about the British House of Lords' debate on the China issue, he replied, "Apart from newspaper reports, I have not yet been able to read the original text of the British House of Lords' debate. Labour MP Lindsay is unaware of the situation here, and I cannot attach importance to his remarks. Fortunately, most leaders in the UK have a true understanding of the situation in China, which is what a great power with keen discernment and rich common sense should have. Mr. Lindsay's advocacy of interfering in China's internal affairs is a mistaken view of the times, indicating that he misunderstands China. He does not know that China was at the forefront in the war against Japanese and Nazi aggression."</p>
<h3>US Marines in Qingdao Have Not Received Withdrawal Orders</h3>
<p>But Will Send Back a Portion of Officers and Soldiers</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 25th] During a reception hosted by Admiral Cooke for leaders from all walks of life in Qingdao on the 25th, this reporter asked a senior US Navy officer stationed in Qingdao about two matters. (1) What impact would Marshal Marshall's return to the United States to assume a new position have on the US Navy and its Marines stationed in Qingdao? He replied, "Marshal Marshall's return to the United States to assume the important position of Secretary of State is proof that the United States attaches even more importance to China. Therefore, the US Navy stationed in Qingdao is not affected by his return. On the contrary, its mission will soon be increased. Qingdao is an important seaport in the Pacific region. In addition to assisting the Chinese government in training and strengthening the Chinese Navy, the US Navy stationed in Qingdao is also responsible for guarding the Pacific. Therefore, no orders have been received for the US Navy to withdraw from Qingdao, but the US Marine Corps is currently planning to send back a portion of officers and soldiers." (2) What is the general's opinion on the American soldiers sentenced to "completed rape" in Beiping? He replied, "This is a legal issue, and there will be a reasonable legal solution. I cannot rashly express my opinion, but I have instructed the troops stationed here to strictly observe discipline."</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Administration and Air Force Headquarters to Negotiate the Division of Airfields</h3>
<p>Investigation Reports on Two Airline Plane Crashes to be Released Soon</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The establishment of the Civil Aviation Administration is a new undertaking in our country, so all work remains to be planned. However, the main task is to assist the development of civil aviation. It is reported that the Administration plans to negotiate with the Air Force Headquarters on the division of airfields because there are only five airfields in China that can be used for civil aviation, such as Beijing and Shanghai. Others are mostly used jointly by the military and civilians, resulting in unclear responsibilities for airfield managers. Currently, the Air Force intends to hand over airfields that are not military strongholds to the Ministry of Communications for management.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Regarding the issue of responsibility for the plane crashes of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, the Ministry of Communications previously sent Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to investigate. The report has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications. Dai told reporters on the 25th that the full investigation will be released by the Ministry of Communications within one or two days. As for the main cause of the accident, it was still due to poor weather.</p>

<h3>French Troops Land on the Xisha Islands; We Are About to Issue a Statement; Minister Bai States the Islands Belong to China</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 25th] Minister of National Defense Bai stated to the press today: The Xisha Islands belong to our country, and of course our country will send troops there. History proves that the islands belong to China. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Wang declined to comment on this issue, saying that he will issue a formal statement in a day or two to clarify China's position. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Nuo emphasized that the Xisha Islands issue is not currently under any negotiation, nor is there any need for negotiation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry stated: France intends to request sovereignty over the Xisha Islands on behalf of Annam (Vietnam).</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] According to senior official sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the reporter for this agency has been informed that China is conducting diplomatic negotiations with France in order to seek the withdrawal of French troops from the Xisha Islands. Formal negotiations between China and France are being conducted separately in Nanjing and Paris. China's position is that China will never discuss the issue of sovereignty over the islands if French troops remain stationed on the islands. Only after the French troops withdraw can this issue be discussed. Another senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that China and France are negotiating the Xisha Islands issue, but declined to clarify whether the current Sino-French negotiations involve the withdrawal of French troops or the discussion of sovereignty.</p>
<p>The official also reiterated that sovereignty over the Xisha Islands belongs to China, because the islands have always been Chinese territory and the inhabitants of the islands are also Chinese. Only recently did France begin to dispute China's sovereignty over the islands.</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, he had not heard of the dispatch of reinforcements to the Xisha Islands, but he emphasized that this matter seemed to be handled by the Navy. According to his personal knowledge, when French troops first attempted to land a few days ago, a battalion of Chinese Marines was stationed on the islands.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 25th] A senior official close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today confirmed that China could accept the proposal of international arbitration on the Xisha Islands issue. It was emphasized that the current issue is the withdrawal of French troops from the islands. China was very willing to consider the suggestion of international arbitration before, but after the French troops landed on the Xisha Islands, the entire situation has changed. Until the French troops withdraw from the Xisha Islands, China cannot consider the suggestion of international arbitration.</p>

<h3>The CCP Persists in Its Prejudices; The Du-Huang Talks Yield No Results</h3>
<p>Xue Dubi Explains the Reasons Why the Project Cannot Be Stopped</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the situation of blocking the Yellow River and the benefits and harms of suspending the blocking work, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) convened relevant parties on January 17 for discussion. Present were Director Huo Baoshu, Water Conservancy Commission Chairman Xue Dubi, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Office Director A.S. Eddington, Deputy Director Bliss, Engineering Advisor Todd, and CCP representative Dong Biwu, among others. Dong Biwu stated that the CCP region had not built any river blocking or risk prevention works, no relief had been provided to residents in the river channel, and that water had been released into the old channel on the 27th of the previous month without notifying their side, etc. After Chairman Xue gave a detailed explanation, Dong stated that the blocking of the river needed to be suspended for three to five months, and no results were achieved in the talks. Afterwards, on the 20th, an informal meeting was held, and the central government agreed to postpone the closure of the river until February 15, while the work of throwing stones would continue. Dong also believed that the opinions of the two sides were far apart and that a decision would have to wait until instructions were received from Yan'an, so there were ultimately no results. Regarding the benefits and harms of suspending the Yellow River blocking project, Chairman Xue stated that intensifying the throwing of stones at this time would be beneficial to the project itself and would not harm the downstream area. On the contrary, if it were suspended for three or five months, and the river were blocked again during the peach blossom flood or a major flood, it would be extremely dangerous for the project and would not be beneficial to the downstream area. The reasons are as follows: (1) The stone dam for blocking the river has reached a critical stage of success or failure. It is currently bearing extremely high water pressure. If the work is stopped, there is a risk that the stone dam and the temporary bridge will be completely washed away. To avoid all efforts being in vain, it is necessary to rush to throw boulders day and night to fight the flood and seize every moment. Recently, the work of throwing is being actively carried out, and there are still incidents of wooden stakes being washed away from time to time. The arduous nature of the project proves this even more. (2) Since the diversion of the river began to flow back into the old channel on December 27 last year, even before the water outlet stone dam is thrown out and closed off during this winter period of low water, the old channel flow is estimated to be no more than 500 cubic meters per second, and the flow rate is also very slow. During this period, the dike works that have not yet been repaired downstream can have time to be repaired. (3) After eight or nine years of drought in the downstream river channel, once water flows in, whether the old dangerous and flat works will still maintain their original state in reality, or whether changes will occur, and to what extent, cannot be determined until the actual water flows through. The current flow of water is small, which is an opportunity to make the necessary observations and plan countermeasures, which is of great benefit to the downstream area. If it is delayed until the flood season, the flow will be too large, and if a flat work becomes a dangerous work, it will be too late to take action, and a breach is to be feared. As for the CCP's request to suspend the river blocking project for five months, it is using the excuse that the downstream dike works have not yet been completed and the residents of the river channel have not yet been relocated. However, the other party (the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government of the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office) issued a notice on November 11 last year, informing the residents along the river to relocate and rush to repair the winter defenses, which shows that they have some preparation. Even if the dike works have not yet been completed and the residents have not yet been completely relocated, the current water flow is very slow, and it is possible to rush to handle it.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 25th] At noon on the 25th, Director of the Repair and Prevention Office, Kong Lingrong, and others went to Luokou to wait for the Yellow River water head. At 5 pm, the Yellow River water passed Yangzhuang (20 li west of Luokou) belonging to Changqing. At 9 pm, it would reach Luokou. The depth, flow, and speed of the water could not be measured due to the wind. The Yellow River has changed its course for nine years, and the dikes have not been repaired for many years. Currently, the national army garrison has been reinforcing them day and night. However, there is no contact with the communist army garrison, and there is a shortage of stone materials downstream, so the reinforcement situation is unknown. It is expected that there will be no worries during the peach blossom flood season, but there will inevitably be major risks during the summer flood season, so prevention must be accelerated.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Airlifts Relief Supplies to the CCP Area in Western Hebei; The US Sends Three Aircraft to Undertake the Transportation, Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] UNRRA will airlift a large number of relief supplies to help the people in the CCP area in western Hebei. According to an announcement by the headquarters of the 5th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division of the US Marine Corps today, the UNRRA relief to the poor people of Zaoping and Laiyuan under the control of the Communist Party in western Hebei has decided to hand over more than one million pounds of valuable items, including old clothes, blankets, medicines, etc., to the US Marine Corps for airdrop by plane starting on the 28th of this month. At that time, the Marine Corps will send three giant transport planes to undertake the airlift. Each plane will take off from Tianjin twice a day, transporting 40,000 pounds a day, which can be completed in 25 days. The national and communist forces in the area near Fuping and Laiyuan have all received notice of this agreement, and the flight routes of the planes have also been specified and notified to both sides. In addition, both sides have also signed a ceasefire agreement to ensure the safety of the Marine Corps personnel, guaranteeing that pilots can pass safely and return to the nearest Marine Corps base in the event of a forced landing. Colonel Kearney, the person in charge of the First Air Wing, stated that all medicines will be dropped using cargo parachutes, while clothes and blankets will be packaged into 90-pound bundles and dropped. It is understood that the area for dropping relief supplies is one mile long and 300 feet wide, and has a white cross flag as a sign. It is estimated that there are about 200,000 people in the area who urgently need relief, some of whom have several people sharing one blanket. After being disturbed by the Japanese army, they have been unable to obtain clothing due to the economic blockade during the state of war. After UNRRA sent personnel to conduct on-site inspections of these miserable situations, it decided to actively provide relief. Afterwards, UNRRA will have two representatives stationed in each dropping area to ensure proper distribution.</p>
<h3>All Lama Temples in Chengde Have Been Destroyed by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 24th] The Eight Great Lama Temples in Chengde, which were first built during the Kangxi reign, are mostly modeled after the Potala Palace in Lhasa, and are the most magnificent in scale. Since they were destroyed by the Communist army, many of the statues of the Yab-Yum (Buddha of Bliss) have been pushed down, and the thousand-hand, thousand-eye Buddha carved from a single 7.2-zhang (approximately 24 meters) wooden trunk has also been shot at, with bullet marks clearly visible on its face. The temple walls are ruined and desolate, without any signs of life. Only 78 lamas remain in the temples, lacking clothing and food. If they were not listed as refugees and received relief from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), they would have already fallen into freezing and starvation. Kunxi, the abbot of the Great Buddha Temple, whose post is in Lhasa, was specially sent here by the Dalai Lama as the general Kanbu, ranking first among the lamas in the north. He is now also exhausted and implores relief agencies to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Menon to Arrive in China Early Next Month</h3>

<h3>Guangdong to Release Prisoners; Can Be Completed Within Ten Days</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] The long-awaited amnesty order was only received by the High and District Courts here on Lunar New Year's Eve. At that time, the staff of the two courts were immediately tense, and busy conveying this order. Even on New Year's Day, they did not rest. The prisoners were even more surprised and overjoyed upon hearing the news. It is estimated that there are one thousand prisoners in the First Prison and Detention Center here who meet the amnesty regulations. Currently, releases are being processed by severity of crime and precedence, and more than 300 people have already been released. Processing will continue daily and will be completed within ten days. However, some prisoners who have no home to return to fear that they will have no food or clothing after being released and ask to remain in prison. The court, citing the major national order, has no authority to make such a decision and can only politely decline.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Daily Newspaper Suffers from Fire; Printing Presses Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 25th] The printing presses of the Xinjiang Daily newspaper caught fire on the 17th. As a result of the efforts of the newspaper's employees, publication was resumed on the 18th, but only a small sheet was produced. The newspaper originally published in both Chinese and Uyghur versions. Subsequently, due to the demands of Uyghur people for an independent Uyghur version, this factory fire occurred after the Uyghur version became independent. Both printing presses were completely destroyed by the fire. Therefore, the newspaper is currently borrowing the printing presses of the Security Command to temporarily resume publication.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Gathering of Elders</h3>

<h3>Japanese Culprits in the Shibuya Incident; Three Police Chiefs Actually Declared Not Guilty; Our Representative in Japan Will Request a Retrial</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The American three-person committee that judged the three Japanese police chiefs involved in the Shibuya Incident today declared the three defendants not guilty after a brief trial. The three police chiefs are Tsuchiya, the director of the Shibuya Police Station, Heito, the assistant director of the Shibuya Police Station, and Miyaji, the assistant investigator of the station. They were accused of acting in violation of the objectives of the occupying forces. People from our delegation hinted that they might request a retrial on behalf of compatriots because Taiwanese compatriots believe that this trial was not entirely fair and impartial. The Shibuya Incident occurred in July of last year when Taiwanese compatriots and Japanese police clashed in front of the Shibuya Police Station. As a result, six Taiwanese compatriots and one Japanese policeman died, and about 20 Taiwanese compatriots were injured. The Japanese police fired a total of 242 shots in the conflict, and 36 Taiwanese compatriots were sentenced to imprisonment and deportation by another three-person committee.</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Pan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Discusses; Disarming Japan Economically; Japanese Industry Should Be Limited to the 1914 Standard</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Vice Minister Pan Xulun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated today that the ministry is currently reviewing various plans from prominent economic experts across the country to disarm Japan economically and industrially, and to lay the foundation for lasting world peace. Experts believe that Japan's aggression was triggered by unlimited economic development, especially during World War I. Therefore, the United Nations should limit Japan's peacetime industry to the standard of 1914, i.e., the beginning of World War I. The United Nations Far Eastern Commission's proposal that Japan's production should be restored to the level of 1928 to 1930 is too lenient, because Japan took advantage of the recession in various countries after World War I and had already established a prosperous economy by 1930, preparing it for aggressive war. While disarming Japan, the United Nations should also strictly limit Japan's light and heavy industries, which can be transformed into wartime industries at any time, so they must be restricted to thoroughly destroy its war potential. Japan's textile, silk, rayon, cement, and paper industries all need to be restricted. Except for the minimum needs of the Japanese people, all equipment and machinery should be allocated to the countries most severely damaged during the war as compensation. Japan's foreign trade should be restricted as much as possible pending the establishment of formal relations with the United Nations, so that Japan cannot use the excuse of conducting foreign trade to engage in political conspiracies. Japan's fishing industry should be monitored and fishing areas should be designated to prevent the secret growth of its naval power. Finally, the Japanese government should not be allowed to take any measures to continue encouraging population growth. In order to correct the economic conditions of the Japanese people in general and to prevent overpopulation from causing another war, the Japanese birth rate must not exceed the average birth rate of other countries.</p>
<h3>More Than 300,000 Japanese Residents Evicted from Taiwan Province Last Year</h3>

<h3>Incident of Overseas Chinese Victims in Palembang; Indonesian Deputy Governor Isa Admits Troops Acted Recklessly; Arrested Overseas Chinese Are Being Released</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] Dr. Isa, Deputy Governor of Sumatra, Indonesian Republic, declared at a press conference that the civilian casualties in the recent Palembang incident were 500 dead and 1,000 injured. Injured Indonesians: 140 people. Isa denied Dutch accusations that Indonesians had premeditated the Palembang incident. Isa arrived here yesterday. (Another dispatch) Chen Yuanju, our consul in Indonesia, commented today on the figures released to the press by Isa regarding the losses suffered by overseas Chinese, saying that he believed his own figures were accurate. He also said that the Indonesian claim that overseas Chinese were Dutch spies without providing concrete or even on-the-spot evidence was pure fabrication. He asked, if they were spies, how would one explain the women and children who were victimized? Chen told reporters that Indonesian people in Palembang even referred to Chairman Chiang as a Dutch spy, simply because Chiang's photo featured three colors (red, white, and blue) on his medal. We have already explained that these three colors have nothing to do with the Dutch flag. Isa admitted that Indonesian troops had arrested a large number of Chinese civilians and were trying to release them. Responding to reporters, Isa said that Indonesian troops may have committed atrocities, but the Indonesian government absolutely opposes such crimes and will investigate them specifically. Isa also said that the Palembang conflict was caused by a Dutch soldier firing a shot into the air during the New Year, followed by blind shooting, which killed a major of the Indonesian army, causing public outrage among the Indonesian people. The incident escalated, and the authorities were unable to suppress it. The Indonesian army's losses were 30 dead.</p>
<h3>Proposed Tunnel Between Hong Kong and Kowloon</h3>

<h3>Supervisory Personnel Are Not Afraid to "Strike Tigers"; It's Just That Corrupt Officials Have Too Many Clever Tricks; Heartfelt Words of Supervisory Committee Member Qiu Niantai to Reporters in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 25th] Supervisory Committee member Qiu Niantai was recently dispatched to Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan to inspect administration. Qiu recently hosted reporters here, first soliciting their opinions on local administration. Qiu also expressed his heartache about the corruption situation in various places, saying that it is not that supervisory personnel only swat flies and are afraid to strike tigers, but that corrupt officials have too many clever tricks. Qiu then published the recent situation in Taiwan from the perspective of a Taiwanese compatriot. Qiu is the son of Qiu Fengjia, the former temporary president of the Republic of Taiwan. It is said that since Taiwan Province was taken over, the political situation has bred a sense of alienation internally and between superiors and subordinates. Although governance in administration is quite intense and planned, it is a pity that it has not adapted to popular sentiment and the current situation, and a small number of corrupt practices brought from the mainland have caused dissatisfaction among Taiwanese people. However, Taiwanese people are forward-thinking and pure, and mostly lean towards the Three Principles of the People. Qiu concluded: Taiwan has abundant industries, with rice, sugar, tea, bananas, camphor, pineapples, timber, fish, and shrimp in agriculture, and coal, gold, oil, and light industrial manufactured goods in industry. Although construction has gradually progressed, there are still 500 factories that have not yet recovered, and there is also a great shortage of talent. Therefore, it is hoped that the industries of Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan can establish links, which will greatly help the construction of a new China.</p>
<h3>The Taiwan Education Inspection Group Returns from Inspection; General Review</h3>
<p>Guo Lianfeng, Assistant of the Tibetan Education Department, Tells Our Reporter</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Education previously sent the Taiwan Education Inspection Group, consisting of Cheng Shih-feng (member of the Education Research Committee), Guo Lianfeng (assistant of the Tibetan Education Department), and Chen Wen-deng (supervisor), to Taiwan in late November of last year to inspect education at all levels. Cheng, Guo, and Chen have recently returned to Beijing and gave an oral report to the Minister of Education on the inspection process last Monday. A detailed written report on their observations is being compiled. Cheng Shih-feng has gone to his hometown in Nanchang. Our reporter recently visited Assistant Guo Lianfeng and asked about the inspection of the education situation in Taiwan Province. Guo said the following:</p>
<p>Overview of Schools: In Taiwan Province, there is one National Taiwan University, as well as two provincial agricultural and industrial colleges and a teachers college. The original law and commerce college has now been merged into National Taiwan University. The private Yanping College is currently submitting an application to the province's education administration authorities for review, but it has not yet been approved. There are more than 100 normal, vocational, and other schools at the secondary education level. There are also many national schools, and education is quite developed. The inspection group went to Taichung, Taipei, Tainan, and other places. After completing each inspection, they convened the local education administration and teaching staff to hold seminars to review the implementation of education, study and research, and discuss issues that should be reformed. Later, after completing the inspection in Taipei, they held two larger-scale seminars, which were also attended by Taiwan Province's education administration authorities, for a general review of the new educational facilities in Taiwan Province. The inspection group put forward 73 suggestions, and after exchanging opinions, the results were satisfactory. The three-person group originally planned to return on January 7, but the planes were grounded, and they inspected several schools in nearby areas, waiting until the 17th to take off. They arrived in Shanghai last Friday and returned to Beijing on Saturday, reporting back to the Ministry of Education last Monday.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Education: The school buildings and equipment for teaching experiments in Taiwan Province's secondary and higher education are quite large in scale, which cannot be compared with those of schools on the mainland. There are several characteristics of education: (1) The political situation is stable, and people from all walks of life regard education as important and cooperate to carry it out, so education is progressing considerably. (2) Teachers have a strong service spirit and can concentrate on their work. Teachers and staff at all schools arrive at school every day and work for eight hours. They can manage students at school before and after class, and there is no phenomenon of leaving immediately after class. This is because teachers are all full-time, and it is forbidden to engage in other part-time work. (3) Teachers have a very practical, non-superficial research spirit, and have achieved many results. (4) Schools have parent-teacher associations that are closely connected with families. Parents contribute a lot to the school's funding and equipment.</p>
<p>Shortage of Teachers: All levels of education in Taiwan Province are experiencing a shortage of teachers. Taking Taiwan University as an example, there are still 80 Japanese professors employed. Most primary and secondary school teachers are also substitutes. The reason is that during the Japanese occupation, although education in Taiwan was quite developed, it was mostly set up for Japanese education, and Taiwanese people had fewer opportunities to receive education. Therefore, there is a lack of talent, and teachers are often recruited at a lower level. Now that the area has been restored, one ten thousand Taiwan dollars is equivalent to three hundred and fifty thousand national currency. Those who work in middle schools in the province and hold teaching positions earn a maximum of ten thousand Taiwan dollars per month, which is already the highest treatment. Locals can reduce expenses due to housing and other conveniences, and can support themselves. Therefore, although the treatment of teachers is not high, their lives are extremely stable. If people from the mainland go there, the cost of sending money home to support their families is insufficient, and because of the distance across the sea, not many are willing to go. Therefore, relieving the shortage of teachers is the most pressing issue of current concern.</p>
<p>Abundant Funding: Because the administrative authorities in Taiwan Province pay attention to education, they raise sufficient funds for provincial education expenditures. However, the education expenditures of some counties are slightly stretched due to tax system reforms. During this inspection, the inspection group agreed with the provincial authorities to open up tax sources and increase surcharges starting this year to increase the income of education funding, and the future is even more optimistic.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Holding Visas Encounter Many Difficulties Upon Entering the Philippines</h3>
<p>Our Consulate Negotiates with the Immigration Bureau</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 25th] Many overseas Chinese from our country who have obtained passports from the US Consulate in Shanghai have recently been unnecessarily detained by the Philippine Immigration Bureau upon arriving here. Some overseas Chinese hold 1947 passports, and they have apparently not taken note of the announcement issued by the Philippine Foreign Minister on January 10 of this year. The announcement states that the annual immigration quota cannot be accumulated. Other detained overseas Chinese are being detained simply for extortion. It is believed that the Chinese consulate here has negotiated with the Immigration Bureau to allow these overseas Chinese to enter the country. However, this case has now reached the legation here because some overseas Chinese are suing the Immigration Bureau for illegally detaining them.</p>
<h3>Nephew Attempts Rape and Fails; Chops Aunt with Cleaver; Heinous Parricide Bloodbath Occurs in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] On the evening of the Lunar New Year's Day, a shocking bloodbath occurred at No. 8 Youfu New Village, Youfu Street, Beijing. The murdered victim was Zhang Meiying, the wife of Sun Rongsheng, a captain staff member of the 18th Garrison Department in Hankou. She was stabbed with a cleaver, injuring vital parts, and died that night after the incident. After three days of investigation by the police, the murderer has been identified as Li Yanchang, Sun Rongsheng's nephew-in-law. Because Li was studying car driving in Beijing, he was allowed by his uncle to live with another friend in Sun's house. Li, young and lecherous, had long harbored inappropriate thoughts about his aunt, who was alone in the house. At about 10 o'clock on the evening of the incident, Li's friend was in another room, so Li took the opportunity to enter the deceased's bedroom and forcibly attempted to rape her. When Zhang refused, he became angry and ashamed and used a cleaver to seriously injure Zhang. Outsiders heard the sound and rushed over, and Li was still standing blankly in the room. He was arrested by the police. After three days of interrogation, he confessed to the attempted rape and murder. In the past year, many obscene tragedies have occurred in Beijing, such as the murder of the young girl Zhu Lanlu in Bailuzhou in April of last year, which has not yet been resolved. The Central Daily News published an editorial on this matter today, calling for "the establishment of a new defense between men and women" to rectify social ethics.</p>
<h3>Zhou Ni Fohai Still Hopes to Delay Death; Yang Shuhui Petitions Higher Court for Retrial; Decision on Approval Expected Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] The death sentence for traitor Zhou Fohai has been finalized, and the review judgment was delivered to the Nanjing Higher Court on the afternoon of the 25th and immediately forwarded to Zhou and his family. Although there are some indications that the execution order may also have been issued simultaneously, this cannot yet be confirmed. However, according to Article 423 of the Criminal Procedure Law, "A petition for retrial does not suspend the execution of the penalty, but the prosecutor of the court having jurisdiction may order a suspension before the ruling on the retrial." Even if the execution order has already been issued, its execution may be temporarily suspended. Zhou's wife, Yang Shuhui, upon learning of the review result the day before, hurriedly sought a retrial. Her petition for retrial was also submitted to the Higher Court on the morning of the 25th. Court President Zhao Chen, to demonstrate impartiality, forwarded it to a criminal court panel other than the Jin (Shiding) and Ge (Zhi) panels, which had previously assisted him in the trial of Zhou's case, for deliberation on whether her reasons were sufficient and legal and to decide whether to grant a retrial. Zhou's wife cited two reasons in her retrial petition: (1) Cheng Keqiang and Peng Su have both been released by the Military Intelligence Bureau and can testify that Zhou had surrendered himself and should be summoned again; (2) The victory at Dushan was due to Zhou's strategic planning, which the previous trial did not value, and should be investigated again. However, according to those familiar with the case, both of these reasons are difficult to establish and cannot be considered new evidence. Regarding the first point, Cheng and Peng submitted detailed reports to the Higher Court after their release, which did not prove that Zhou had surrendered himself. Regarding the second point, the Ministry of National Defense had previously replied that it was unrelated to Zhou. Therefore, Zhou's reasons for petitioning for a retrial are very weak and are unlikely to be affirmed. According to Article 46 of the Criminal Procedure Law, "A death sentence shall be executed within three days of receiving the order approved by the highest judicial administrative authority." If Zhou's execution order has already been issued or may be issued within days, the decision on whether to grant a retrial will certainly be made in the near future, and Zhou's end is approaching.</p>
<h3>Evidence of Traitor Ding Mocun's Crimes Completely Investigated by the Court</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Zhao Chen, President of the Capital Higher Court, stated that the investigation of the evidence of traitor Ding Mocun's crimes has been completed and a public trial will be scheduled soon.</p>
<h3>Tani Hisao to be Tried Next Month; Investigative Hearings Begin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Victim's Remains to be Exhumed</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 25th] Tani Hisao, the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, has been scheduled for a public trial by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense from February 6th to 8th. To facilitate the reporting of crimes by victims or their families, the tribunal has specifically set up a temporary investigation court at the Eleventh District Office on Yuhua Road outside Zhonghua Gate from the 25th to the 28th, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, to handle investigation matters. On the morning of the 25th, Court President Shi Meiyu, accompanied by Judges Ge Zhaotang and Ye Zaizeng, personally went to the district office. District Chief Zhang of the district first convened a meeting with the families of the victims and issued more than 200 summonses. More than 40 people reported and recounted their experiences at the time, with elderly women crying about the murder of their sons and young women complaining about the murder of their husbands, all extremely aggrieved. An elderly man named Wu Zhonggui, 72 years old, reported that his mother, over 80, and his brother-in-law, over 70, were both killed that year. More than ten people were once blocked and killed in a cave in Yangxiang, and the way they were killed is difficult to describe in detail. According to Liu Decai, the leader of the burial team of the Red Swastika Society and Tongshan Hall, and Ge Changgen, the deputy leader, there are more than 2,000 massacred bodies buried at the foot of Yuhuatai Mountain, and more than 5,000 bodies burned to death at the Jinling Arsenal, and 700 poor people drowned in the Qinhuai River, buried along the river, all of which can be excavated. The court originally planned to exhume the remains on the afternoon of the 25th, but it was postponed due to rain. Tani Hisao's crimes are as numerous as mountains, and it is impossible for him to escape death.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Obligation to Abide by Treaties</h3>
<p>Ancient countries that closed themselves off and were self-sufficient had no possibility of external conflict because they did not interact with neighboring countries. As transportation developed and international relations became frequent, countries became more and more interdependent, and opportunities for friction increased. Friction that could not be resolved satisfactorily led to war. Western philosophers, with a compassionate heart, advocated international law as the rule of international relations, as a common standard for all countries to abide by, which invisibly eliminated many international disputes and laid the foundation for international peace. However, international law does not prohibit war. In other words, if there are disputes between countries, they can still resort to war as the final solution. International law is only a set of general principles, and the detailed regulations on specific matters still depend on the conclusion of treaties between countries for mutual observance. Therefore, in terms of protecting the forces of international peace, the function of treaties is actually higher than that of international law. If all countries could abide by the treaties they have agreed to sign, the possibility of war could be reduced fundamentally.</p>
<p>A treaty is established between two or more countries regarding their mutual interests, and its purpose is to achieve a common desire. Each country that signs a treaty has an obligation to abide by it. Taking a peace treaty as an example, the defeated country signing clauses unfavorable to itself is certainly out of necessity, but once it is signed, it takes effect, and there should be no attempts to renege on it due to changing circumstances. Tracing the origin of treaties, they existed long before international law came into being. In ancient times, countries, based on religious and moral concepts, regarded them as sacred and inviolable, and could not be abandoned unless both parties agreed. Otherwise, they would fundamentally lose credibility and find it difficult to gain a foothold on the international stage. In modern times, international relations have become increasingly complex, and the need for and binding force of treaties have become even more important. At the time of the outbreak of World War I in 1914, countries had signed as many as 8,000 treaties, many of which had become invalid because the purpose for which they were signed had been achieved or their time had expired, but the number of treaties added after the war was also considerable. From the sheer number alone, one can gauge the relationship between treaties and international peace. The outbreak of World War II was directly due to Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Covenant of the League of Nations, and therefore bears the responsibility for destroying international peace.</p>
<p>After the war, politicians from various countries worked hard to rebuild peace. Since the passage of the United Nations Charter, treaties have been signed with Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Finland. Peace treaties with Germany and Japan should also be initiated soon. On the side of the victorious countries, alliances have been signed with each other for mutual assistance. In the Security Council, a general disarmament plan is being discussed, and multilateral treaties may be signed in the future to provide guarantees. On the surface, it seems that international peace can be permanently established. However, whether international peace can be maintained in the future depends largely on whether countries have the sincerity and determination to abide by treaties. Recently, two major international events have occurred that are related to the binding force of treaties: one is the Soviet Union's request for joint defense of the Spitzbergen Islands, and the other is the issue of China's recovery of Dalian.</p>
<p>According to the Spitzbergen Treaty signed in Paris in 1920, sovereignty over the archipelago belongs to Norway, but no fortifications or naval bases may be established. Article 9 of the treaty clearly states: "Norway, by virtue of its accession to the League of Nations, assumes all the rights and obligations pertaining to it. Norway undertakes not to construct any naval base in the territory specially designated in Article 1 of this Treaty, nor to allow any other country to establish any naval base, nor to construct any fortifications in the said territories which may be used for warlike purposes." The original signatories to the treaty were the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The Soviet Union later joined, and is therefore bound by the treaty. Because the Soviet Union wanted to strengthen what it considered a vulnerable point in its northern defense line, it requested joint defense of the Spitzbergen Islands, which has been opposed by the United Kingdom and the United States. The reason is that if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States reach any agreement to modify the treaty, the opinions of all the signatories should be solicited in advance, and unilateral decisions to abandon it should not be made. In the future, the issue of joint defense of the Spitzbergen Islands will undoubtedly become one of the major international disputes, and perhaps if it cannot be resolved properly, the United Kingdom and the United States may propose a discussion by the international security agencies, and the sanctity and inviolability of treaties will undergo a rigorous test.</p>
<p>The Spitzbergen Treaty is multilateral, but the issue of China's recovery of Dalian is based on the Treaty of Friendship and Alliance between China and the Soviet Union. Dalian originally belonged to China, and was then leased to Russia, and after the Russo-Japanese War, it was transferred to Japan. In terms of sovereignty, the transfer was originally illegal, and after Japan surrendered, it should have been returned to its original owner and received by China. In the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty's agreement on Dalian, the Soviet Union solemnly declared that it would guarantee respect for China's sovereignty over all of the Three Eastern Provinces, regarding them as an inseparable part of China, so Article 3 of the treaty clearly stipulates that the administrative power of Dalian belongs to China. The Chinese side agreed to declare Dalian a free port, open to trade and shipping from all countries, and detailed arrangements were made to guarantee the Soviet Union's interests in importing and exporting goods in Dalian. Looking at the content of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty as a whole, it actually contains the basic spirit of mutual concession and mutual benefit. However, although the treaty had long been in effect, Dalian still could not be recovered. The Soviet Union certainly has the sincerity and determination to abide by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty, so the return of Dalian should not be delayed for so long as to become an international problem.</p>
<p>Abiding by treaties is the basic obligation of all countries and an important factor in maintaining international peace. We hope that politicians from all countries will look at the big picture and start from the immediate situation, and not repeat the mistakes of Germany and Japan, and be responsible for destroying treaties!</p>
<p>Five-Year Economic Plan</p>
<p>The five-year economic plan has been approved by the Chairman and submitted to the Executive Yuan for implementation. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Washington: A spokesman for the Export-Import Bank stated that if China wants to obtain the $500 million loan already designated by the United States, it must rectify its economy within five months. In other words, the Chinese government must submit a detailed plan by June 30, explaining how to use the loan, and so on. These two news items, not early and not late, happen to be published at this time. We have no way of guessing whether there is any connection between them. According to common theory, the drafting of this five-year plan started as early as 1944, so it has nothing to do with the $500 million loan. In terms of reality, since the so-called $500 million loan is a reconstruction loan and requires a detailed plan, then there may be some connection. Because this five-year plan is actually a reconstruction plan. Even if we start from scratch and rewrite it, it may not be able to completely break away from its framework, which is conceivable.</p>
<p>The content of the five-year plan is divided into six categories: transportation, industry, mining, electricity, water conservancy, and agriculture. It is said that this plan includes the valuable experience of many experts, so it is extremely practical, and in terms of construction, its costs, labor, materials, and completion time all have accurate budgets. It can be called comprehensive and well-thought-out, completely different from the general partial or idealistic plans. If objective conditions such as funding and personnel can be properly coordinated, and everyone proceeds step by step, we believe that this plan will be the backbone of our country's economic recovery.</p>
<p>The full text has not yet been disclosed, and we do not know the distribution of each department, especially the specific facilities in the agricultural sector. General impressions are still in earnest expectation. Because in the past twenty years, economic construction has been steady, and industries such as highways, industry, and mining have not been suspended due to internal and external troubles, but the improvement in agriculture has been significantly lagging behind. And several budding businesses, such as the promotion of American cotton and American tobacco, and the improvement of silkworm varieties, have also been destroyed by the war. In addition, problems such as donations, corvée, transportation, and public security have not yet been sorted out, so that the villagers are restless and the countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy. Still, from the overall point of view, it only accounts for one part of the economy. However, we must know that most of the raw materials and daily necessities are derived from the countryside, and the outlet for industrial products is also mainly the countryside. Now the industrial recovery has not been completed, and various productions are less than half of what they were before the war. But many goods on the market have already shown obvious signs of stagnation and congestion. The decline in farmers' purchasing power is undeniable. In addition, raw materials for factories, such as wheat, cotton, tobacco leaves, wool, and even silkworm cocoons, all have to rely on foreign goods for supply, and if the supply is occasionally delayed, production may be suspended. From this point of view, revitalizing the countryside is undoubtedly the most important task in economic construction. Everyone knows that our country's farmers account for 80 to 90 percent of the total population. If the living standards of this absolute majority of the population cannot be improved, or even cannot be maintained, how much obstacle will there be to economic construction?</p>
<p>Secondly, the financial and monetary system problems are not listed in the original plan. We hope that there will be a whole set of methods that can be implemented in conjunction with it. Because the crux of the current economic problem lies in the instability of the monetary system, so sorting out the monetary system is actually the initial work of economic construction and also an important work of economic construction. If the current financial system, monetary system, and the interest rates, prices, wages, etc. that it entails remain the same and are not fundamentally reorganized, then the above economic construction will be greatly disturbed, at least in the process. Because all calculations cannot be determined, then all plans cannot be established. We speculate that the reason why it was not included in the original plan is perhaps because the matter is urgent and must be handled in advance, and it is not convenient to schedule a five-year procedure to proceed gradually.</p>
<p>But within the $500 million US dollar loan, if it is true, as it is said, that a detailed plan for economic restructuring must be submitted first, then we still believe that this is an important program. Now exports have not been developed, overseas remittances are largely evading, and inflation shows no signs of contraction. If we want to sort it out in time, we believe that we must seek help from foreign investment. There are naturally many ways for foreigners to invest. In addition to striving for safety, the objects of their choice are naturally the most profitable first, such as transporting goods to China, handling engineering, setting up factories, mining, and building roads. In the past year, international trade has not yet officially started, but the foreign exchange funds spent have been considerable. This number can easily be seen from the monthly customs statistics. However, the trade deficit is too large, and international trade is becoming more and more unfavorable, so the government has gradually restricted the application for imported goods. According to this inference, the so-called $500 million or other loans, if established, the way they are used will not necessarily be the same as in the past, still allowing them to flow into general and normal uses. We believe that the most urgent use is to sort out the monetary system and stabilize the value of currency.</p>

<h3>Opening of New Jiaozuo Section of the Daoqing Railway</h3>
<p>140,000 Tons of Coal in Jiaozuo Awaiting Transportation</p>
<p>[Our Xinxiang Dispatch] Since the repair project of the new Jiaozuo section of the Daoqing Railway started on the 14th of last month, the entire project was completed on the afternoon of the 14th of this month. The next day (the 15th), at 8:00 AM, Shan Ping, the director of the Han Railway Bureau, represented Qian Zongyuan and led the heads of various sections, along with Qian Guiyi, the director of the New Jiaozuo Section Repair Project Office, and Li Xueyi, the director of the Xinxiang Office, to inspect the repair situation of the section along the line from Xinxiang to Jiaozuo by light special train, and to conduct the first test run. The reporter recently learned about the repair process of the Xinxiang-Jiaozuo railway in detail from Li Xueyi, director of the Xinxiang Office of the Pinghan Railway. According to his reply: The reason why this road could not be started last year was due to the lack of equipment. However, due to the serious coal shortage in the Yangtze River area and Henan Province, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Transportation to complete the repairs and open to traffic for coal transportation by the end of the year, so as to solve the fuel problem as soon as possible. After receiving the order, this road immediately established the "New Jiaozuo Section Repair Project Office" in Xinxiang and started work on the 14th of last month. More than 1,000 workers and more than 300 large horse-drawn carts were mobilized to work separately. During the period, the work was difficult and the equipment was extremely scarce. In addition, the Communist army often shot workers and damaged the restoration project in the area of Xiuwu, Daiwang, and so on, so that the work could not be completed before the deadline. All employees insisted on one month in this extremely difficult situation, and the entire repair was completed on the 14th of this month. The entire 62-kilometer line, except for the Xinxiang to Xiuwu section (41 kilometers), which is heavy rail and can be used for locomotives and cargo cars, the remaining Xiuwu to Jiaozuo section is light rail with 16 kilograms, so it can only be used for small light trains modified from cars. It is estimated that 150 tons of coal can be transported out every day, and if the track condition is good, it can be increased to 400 tons. The light rail from Xiuwu to Jiaozuo is currently being replaced with heavy rail. If the goal can be achieved, the coal reserves in Jiaozuo (currently about 140,000 tons) can be continuously transported out, and the coal shortage can be solved. As for the road protection issue of this road, we are requesting the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters for protection, and it is currently being guarded by armed workers of this road. After the test run on the 15th, tickets will be sold soon. However, the ticket price will be doubled compared to the price set by the current Pinghan Road. Three stations will be set up: Huojia, Xiuwu, and Jiaozuo.</p>

<h3>Default on Debt and Then Commit Murder: Robbing a Boat and Killing People in the Middle of the Night. Shouting "Soybeans Are Here!" and Chopping Down with a Kitchen Knife. The Dead Were Thrown into the River, and the Wounded Were Fortunate to Be Rescued.</h3>
<p>[Report from Gaochun by this newspaper] On the 11th of this month, Chen Shujin and his son-in-law Wang Xianmu from Shuiyang Town, Anhui, used a civilian boat to load 30 bundles of vegetable cakes and transported them from Shuiyang to Dongba Town for sale. When they passed through this city, it was already afternoon, so they docked the boat at the Mendouwei area across the river from the urban area. Because Liang Jiagui, a resident there, had a friendly relationship with Wang and others, Liang owed Wang three bundles of wheat. Therefore, they took the opportunity to go to Liang Jiagui's house to demand payment. Liang Jiagui agreed to repay the debt and said, "There are five *zu* of soybeans to be sold in Dongba. After the sale, the proceeds will be used to offset the wheat debt, and then we will settle the account. He also instructed them to move the boat about *li* to Sangu on the same night to load the soybeans." Wang Xianmu thought that it was a win-win situation and agreed. Unexpectedly, at midnight, as the two were sleeping, Liang Jiagui suddenly appeared with a kitchen knife, shouting, "Soybeans are here!" Just as the two were about to get up, they were met with the kitchen knife. Wang Xianmu was slashed once on the neck and fell into the water, but he did not die. Chen Shujin was slashed more than ten times and died. The body was tied up and thrown into the water. The murderer loaded the vegetable cakes onto another boat and escaped. Wang Xianmu went ashore naked and covered in blood. Enduring the pain, he ran to Hukoutou Village, about *li* away, and opened the door of a blacksmith shop. The blacksmith was shocked when he opened the door and called out to the neighbors in the village. Wang Xianmu was unable to speak due to his injuries, but he was able to write down the details with a pen. The villagers rushed to the rescue that night, reported it to the county government, and carried him to the county hospital. The county government arrested the murderer's family, and after questioning them, they were temporarily released on bail, responsible for collecting Chen Shujin's body. Wang Xianmu is now able to speak after medical treatment. The authorities are pursuing the murderer.</p>

<h3>Rongyang, Guangwu, and Fushui Counties in Henan Province Are Merged into Chenggao County: Yuanwu and Yangwu Counties Are Merged into Bolang County</h3>
<p>[Report from Zhengzhou by this newspaper] Rongyang, Guangwu, and Fushui counties in Henan Province are small in area and sparsely populated. Their borders are adjacent, and in fact, there is no need to divide them. The previous Changju had a proposal to merge these three counties. The name after the merger was officially named Chenggao County by the Ministry of Interior. Later, the War of Resistance against Japan started, and the plan was delayed and not implemented. This year, Henan Province has carried out large-scale staff reductions and streamlining of administration, and has made great efforts to reduce the institutions below the county level. At the same time, Che Xingwang and other representatives of the people of Guangwu County submitted a report to the Henan Provincial Government, requesting that the three counties be merged as soon as possible to facilitate the implementation of government orders. After deliberation by the provincial government committee, it was deemed necessary and it was decided to implement it from this year. The Ministry of Interior was consulted and it was named Chenggao County. At the same time, Yuanwu and Yangwu counties were merged into Bolang County. The Henan Provincial Government also submitted the proposal for approval and decided to implement it in advance. However, the location of the county seat for the above two merged counties has not yet been clearly stipulated. Regarding the reduction of institutions below the county level, the general regulations stipulate that the county government should set up four sections and one office. The same type of business in the original institutions should be merged and handled separately. At the township level, they should also be merged and expanded according to the actual situation. For example, Zhengzhou originally had three towns and ten townships, but now it has been merged into two towns and six townships. The regulations for the mergers of various counties have been implemented since January 1 of this year. All laid-off employees will be paid one month's salary as severance pay.</p>

<h3>Thirteen Counties in Northern Anhui Jointly Establish Farms to Revitalize the Yellow River Flood Area</h3>
<p>[Report from Bengbu by this newspaper] Northern Anhui has been plagued by frequent disasters and military costs, followed by the Yellow River floods. The rural areas are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the flood areas urgently need relief. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), recognizing this, has joined hands with the four ministries of agriculture and forestry, food, transportation, and economy, as well as the Department of Health, to establish the Yellow River Flood Area Reconstruction Committee. Branch committees will be set up in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan, and work teams will be set up in each county. In northern Anhui, thirteen counties including Fuyang, Taihe, Yingshang, Wuhe, Sixian, Shouxian, Fengyang, Fengtai, Dingyuan, Lingbi, Huaiyuan, Xu Yi, and Huoqiu will jointly establish farms. The committee will allocate tractors to help these disaster-stricken counties with cultivation. These machines can cultivate 50 acres of land per day and will be used for mobile cultivation within each county. It is estimated that the thirteen counties will cultivate a total of approximately 4.4 million acres. This work is scheduled to be completed before the spring plowing. The seeds, fertilizers, small farm tools, and flour for work relief will also be allocated by the committee. The estimated flour allocation is 8,000 tons in January, 8,000 tons in February, 10,000 tons in March, 12,000 tons in April, and 12,000 tons in May. If the seeds cannot be received before the spring plowing, the flour will be exchanged with farmers in various villages to help them complete the cultivation work as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Inquiries Regarding Identity Card Detention Are Welcome</h3>
<p>This column published a suggestion from Mr. Li Zihe to simplify the procedures for obtaining national identity cards. The Civil Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government has replied: "The issuance of national identity cards in this city must be forwarded by the district Baozhang according to law; the district Bao is a grassroots autonomous organization, and it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the population dynamics in its jurisdiction. As for the forwarding procedures, detention is not allowed. The municipal government has repeatedly issued orders to correct this. If there are still cases of delays and accumulations, we will investigate and deal with them.

<h3>There Is a Deep Pit on Sichuan Middle Road</h3>
<p>Sichuan Middle Road is an important thoroughfare in the city. More than three *zhang* south of Beijing Road, there is a deep pit with a diameter of two *chi*. When I take the bus, if the driver is not careful and the wheels run over the deep pit, the car body will shake violently, making passengers feel uneasy. I believe there are many others who have the same feeling when passing Sichuan Road. I am asking for a small space in your newspaper to publish this and request the Public Works Bureau to repair it as soon as possible (Wu Haifeng).</p>
<h3>Price Increases for Kerosene Should Be Restricted</h3>
<p>Recently, many citizens use kerosene stoves for cooking, so the use of kerosene is more widespread and has become an important daily necessity for the public. Recently, the old price of kerosene in city shops, including the can fee, has risen from 15,000 yuan to about 30,000 yuan per five gallons. However, the price at which companies such as Mobil and Asia Petroleum sell to their managers is still 12,000 yuan per five gallons, including the can fee (7,000 yuan for kerosene and 5,000 yuan for the can). However, because the managers are aware of the unstable supply of kerosene and the rising price of gold notes, they hoard the goods and resell them to shops for tens of thousands of yuan per can, making a profit of tens of thousands of yuan per can. Furthermore, it is said that whenever managers receive a delivery slip from the kerosene company, they can sell the delivery slip to others without having to pay for the goods, making a profit without working for it. We should ask the Social Bureau of the Municipal Government to find a way to restrict this kind of illegal profiteering by intermediaries to benefit the public. (Sheng Bengong).</p>
<h3>Village Self-Defense Teams Should Be Established Urgently</h3>
<p>Recently, bandits have been rampant in the villages of western Shanghai, and robberies are frequent, causing anxiety among the villagers. After the security forces in the villages of western Shanghai were ordered to be abolished, there was a lack of organized armed groups, so they could not effectively defend themselves. Although the police station patrols day and night due to the vast jurisdiction and inconvenient transportation, it has not been slightly slack. The number of volunteer patrols in each village is small, and the area is vast, so there are not enough people to allocate, and it is felt that the reach is not long enough. As for the Baojia personnel, who participate in assisting, they are helpless to go out empty-handed. How can they fight against bandits with weapons? Therefore, if we want to eliminate the banditry in the suburbs, we must organize self-defense teams in each village. The villagers in the suburbs have lived here for generations, and their families and property are closely tied to this place. When they encounter a robbery, they can bravely arrest the bandits. If each village is jointly defended, it can not only supplement the police force but also suppress the bandits' arrogance. It is a good method for local autonomy. We sincerely hope that the authorities will adopt it and order the villages to establish self-defense teams as soon as possible to consolidate the security of the suburbs.</p>

<h3>Stalin Accepts British Guarantee: Anglo-Soviet Treaty Still Valid. Soviet Union Suggests Extending the Treaty to Fifty Years. Misunderstandings Caused by Bevin's Speech Have Been Resolved.</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 24th] The British Foreign Office announced today that Marshal Stalin has accepted Britain's guarantee that it has no intention of abandoning the Anglo-Soviet alliance and proposed that the two countries jointly consider removing weakening clauses from the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Agreement and extending the term of the agreement again. In a note sent to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Stalin stated that it is now clear that Your Excellency and I have the same view of the Anglo-Soviet alliance. Stalin's note officially ended the misunderstanding surrounding Bevin's speech. It is widely believed that Bevin's next action will be to study the meaning of Stalin's statement that the Anglo-Soviet Agreement has "weakening clauses". Bevin had hinted that he was planning to conclude a "Prevent German Aggression" agreement with the Soviet Union, and it is rumored that Stalin has agreed to extend the term of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement to 50 years.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Stalin has accepted Foreign Secretary Bevin's assurance that the Anglo-Soviet treaty remains valid. The Soviet newspaper Pravda recently stated that Bevin's Christmas broadcast, in which he said that Britain was not bound by any obligations other than those to the United Nations, was a declaration that the Anglo-Soviet treaty was no longer valid. After Britain's repeated statements, Pravda maintained its previous statement and did not recognize the British explanation. The British Foreign Office today published the exchange of telegrams between Bevin and Stalin. Bevin telegraphed Stalin on January 18, stating that he was deeply grateful for the warm reception given to the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Montgomery, during his visit to your country. I am studying the report that Marshal Montgomery brought with him, but I am deeply disturbed by Your Excellency's statement to him that London may have recognized that the Anglo-Soviet treaty and post-war cooperation have ceased to be valid due to the existence of the United Nations. Pravda has previously misunderstood this, and I believe that other powers have also often expressed that they will base their policies on the United Nations. Marshal Montgomery told me that Your Excellency does not have the same opinion of the Anglo-Soviet treaty as Pravda, and of course, I do not have this intention either. Stalin replied to Bevin by telegram on January 23, stating that Your Excellency's statement that Britain is not bound by any obligations is indeed puzzling to me, and I believe that if it is not explained, it will inevitably be used to undermine Anglo-Soviet friendship. I believe that the Anglo-Soviet treaty still creates obligations for both parties regardless. I previously met with British reporter Wallace on September 17 of last year and stated that the Soviet Union is bound by the Anglo-Soviet treaty and is not affected by the United Nations Charter. Your Excellency's telegram and the statement from your government have completely eliminated the cause of the misunderstanding. Now I am sure that Your Excellency and I have the same view of the Anglo-Soviet treaty. After receiving Stalin's telegram, Bevin ordered the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union to thank Stalin for his "frank and useful statement".</p>
<h3>Relations Between Britain and the Soviet Union May Have New Developments. Soviet Refusal to Exchange Military Officers</h3>
<p>[Report by this newspaper] [London, 25th Broadcasting: According to well-informed sources here, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will reopen negotiations on the Anglo-Soviet alliance with the Soviet side when he attends the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow in March. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: The policy of the British government is to seek the closest possible relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Another report: When British Chief of Staff Montgomery visited the Soviet Union earlier, he suggested an exchange of military officers between Britain and the Soviet Union. Stalin has rejected this suggestion, saying that the intention of exchanging military officers is very good, but this is not the time, as it may be misunderstood as a preparation for war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Since Stalin's telegram to Foreign Secretary Bevin hinted that the Soviet Union might agree to extend the validity of the alliance from two to fifty years if "reservations that could weaken the Anglo-Soviet alliance" could be eliminated, well-informed sources expect Foreign Secretary Bevin to act immediately on this hint. The first step should be to explore the nature of these so-called reservations. Article 4 of the alliance stipulates that the contracting parties should engage in military mutual assistance in the event of renewed aggression by Germany and other former enemy countries, and states that this article should remain valid until both parties jointly adopt common action with other like-minded countries to protect post-war peace and resist aggression. The Franco-Soviet alliance of December 1944 deleted the provision that military mutual assistance would not apply after the establishment of a general security system. It is thought that the Soviet government would also like to delete this provision from the Anglo-Soviet alliance to make military mutual assistance an absolute obligation. London political observers believe that this step may not be impossible.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the British Press's Views</h3>
<p>Recognizing the Need to Revise the Treaty</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The recent exchange of notes between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet leader Stalin on the validity of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty has been commented on by the British press. The Labor Party's Daily Herald stated, "It is obvious that the alliance treaty must be revised, because it is a wartime treaty, and most of it is out of date, so it should be changed to a regional security agreement, as stipulated in Chapter 8 of the United Nations Charter. The time has come to eliminate misunderstandings and rebuild wartime friendship on a permanent basis in peacetime." The London Times stated, "An unfortunate misunderstanding has led to a fortunate result, and the next step to improve Anglo-Soviet relations will be sought at the Moscow conference in March." The Daily Mail stated, "Marshal Stalin clearly hopes for a stronger treaty, and even hopes to expand its scope." The News Chronicle stated, "The future Anglo-French alliance should be drafted along the lines of the Anglo-Soviet treaty, and any modifications to the latter may affect the former." The Daily Mail stated, "It is not easy to interpret Moscow's state of mind. Marshal Stalin's recent conversations with reporters and the exchange of notes with Bevin hint at an attitude of friendship."</p>
<h3>Success or Failure of Anglo-Burmese Negotiations Still Difficult to Predict</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] U Tin Tut, one of the Burmese representatives to the Anglo-Burmese negotiations, said that the talks were proceeding smoothly in a friendly atmosphere and that it was impossible to predict that the negotiations would fail, adding that neither the British nor the Burmese side could allow the negotiations to fail. Another representative, former Burmese Prime Minister U Saw, said that the outcome of the negotiations was still difficult to predict, but that all issues of close mutual concern had been discussed and needed to be seriously considered, and that it was expected to take several days to reach a definitive decision. The British government has made every effort to consider and accept the Burmese demands, and if the negotiations unfortunately fail, neither the British nor the Burmese side can be blamed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 24th] A spokesman for the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma said that the League was prepared to instruct its representatives to withdraw from the Burmese Governor's Executive Council if the Anglo-Burmese negotiations failed, and that the Burmese delegation in London had been summoned to return to Rangoon by January 31.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] Well-informed sources said that British Prime Minister Attlee had announced that he would report to the House of Commons early next week on the outcome of the recent independent negotiations conducted here by the Burmese delegation. It is reported that the talks will conclude next Monday, and the delegation will return to Rangoon before the end of the month. It is said that Attlee and his cabinet members expressed sympathy for the various proposals put forward by Burma, but strongly urged that if Burma could first achieve dominion status, it would benefit both sides. Observers here said that although Burmese leaders have strived for complete independence, Burma may first become an independent and autonomous dominion within the British Commonwealth, so as to reap the benefits of Commonwealth and military cooperation with the British Empire.</p>
<h3>Burmese Authorities Arrest Communist Leaders</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 24th] The Burmese government gazette contained an order from the authorities declaring the Burmese Communist Party and the Red Flag Peasants' Association (Trotskyist faction) to be illegal organizations. Police have been dispatched to arrest the leaders of the Communist Party and other illegal political parties, and 26 people, including Red Flag Association leader Soe Thein, have been arrested. The government gazette stated that members of the aforementioned groups had trespassed into courts and government offices, and that members of the Communist Party had looted rice warehouses, and had publicly distributed leaflets inciting rebellion.</p>
<h3>Britain Issues New Note to Egypt</h3>
<p>Britain Firmly Advocates Sudanese Self-Determination</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 25th] The British government today presented a new note to the Egyptian government, stating its position on the Sudan issue. Observers believe that this new note will not lead to an agreement in the negotiations to amend the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance of 1936. British Ambassador Campbell met with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy today to deliver the note. Nokrashy said that he would announce a response tomorrow. Neither side disclosed the contents of the new British note, but it is known that Britain insists on Sudanese self-determination and opposes Egypt's demand for the annexation of Sudan into Egyptian territory under the rule of the Egyptian monarch.</p>
<h3>Coeur du was Elected as Temporary Head of the World Bank</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] The Board of Directors of the World Bank today elected Coeur du as its temporary head. The sudden death of former Deputy Head Smith (who had resumed acting head duties after Meyer's resignation as head) forced the Board to quickly elect Managing Director Coeur du as temporary head, and also prompted the Board to fill these two vacancies. Truman and other American officials unanimously praised Smith as one of the most capable people in public service.</p>
<h3>South Africa Echoes Australian Proposal, Advocating Small Countries' Participation in Peace Treaty Discussions; Soviet Representative Firmly Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The South African representative to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers today presented his views on the procedures for the participation of small countries in the meeting, believing that all active belligerent countries should be allowed to participate in the work of the various committees to be established, and that small countries should have the right to express opinions, ask questions, and receive documents. British representative Strang said that Britain believes that representatives of small countries should generally participate in the meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The French representative also said that several points of the South African proposal were relevant to France. Soviet representative Gusev reiterated that the mandate of the Council of Foreign Ministers had clear provisions and would not allow small countries to participate in the work of the Four Power representatives at this stage, but could only be invited to attend the meeting to express their views. American representative Murphy said that the mandate of the Council of Foreign Ministers should be strictly interpreted, and there was no agreement after a long debate.</p>
<p>Avoid Excessive Demands in Border Adjustments</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] South African representatives Skellen and Kerlen presented South Africa's views on the German peace treaty to the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers today, saying that South Africa favored Germany becoming a decentralized and federal state, but not including Prussia. This federal state should have a central government to handle major affairs such as foreign affairs and the economy. The basic goal is to prevent the resurgence of German military power, while not restricting the development of its economic and social life, so that it can occupy its rightful place in Europe. Regarding the issue of Germany's borders, South Africa believes that it is not appropriate to cede large areas of land inhabited purely by Germans to its neighboring countries, and that the eastern border of Germany should be at most the Oder River. If Poland's territory extends deep into Germany, it will create uncontrollable friction. South Africa recognizes the importance of the Saar region to the French economy, but firmly opposes the annexation of the region into French territory, because the residents of the region are almost purely German. South Africa generally agreed with the small-scale border adjustments requested by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Plans to Try Again to Form a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>Success or Failure Depends on the Attitude of the Opposition Parties</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] The "Kyoto Shimbun" reported today that Prime Minister Yoshida has re-determined his plan to form a coalition cabinet. If an agreement is reached among the leaders of the three major parties, the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, and the Social Democratic Party, then the Yoshida cabinet will submit its resignation within a few days, and the three major parties may hold a meeting today. According to some observers, the Social Democratic Party, which refused to participate in the Yoshida coalition cabinet on the 17th of this month, has changed its attitude after suddenly holding an executive committee meeting on the 22nd, and Yoshida's proposal to form a coalition cabinet again has apparently been encouraged by this. In addition, the general strike scheduled for February 1 is another reason why Yoshida is eager to stabilize the political situation. It is rumored that Yoshida is preparing to invite all political parties to join the cabinet, except for the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Japan Issues New Public Bonds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese government issued new national public bonds yesterday totaling approximately 5 billion yen, with an interest rate of 3.5%.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Birthday</h3>
<p>Although Old, He Has a Good Appetite</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] Tomorrow is General MacArthur's 67th birthday. He will work as usual and only have lunch with his wife and son, followed by a birthday cake. According to his adjutant, there are no special celebration plans. MacArthur, who is spending his birthday abroad for the twelfth consecutive year, is now 67 years old. Although he thinks about retiring someday, he is still very healthy and is fully focused on the occupation work. Since arriving in Japan, he has only taken a few days off due to a cold last spring. Doctors say that he has a good appetite and is quite casual about food, not being particular about fine cuisine. One general said that the old man has an "iron stomach."</p>
<h3>Marshall Personally Attends Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference; Vandenberg and Connally Will Accompany Him; Marshall Hosts Banquet for Envoys from Various Countries</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall will attend the Foreign Ministers Conference, which, according to the decision of the recent New York Foreign Ministers Conference, will be held in Moscow on March 10 to discuss the drafts of the German and Austrian peace treaties.

<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned today that the new Secretary of State Marshall will invite Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Connally to accompany him when he attends the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in March. Vandenberg and Connally initially expressed their unwillingness to go, but have now agreed, in order to continue to represent the unified foreign policy of the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Riots in Punjab Province, India; Caused by the Arrest of Muslim League Leaders; Clashes with Police Result in 200 Injuries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lahore, 24th] Police today searched the offices of the Muslim National Guard and the Hindu National Guard in Lahore. Seven Muslim League leaders were arrested for refusing to be searched. Muslims in Lahore held a meeting in a mosque to protest the arrests.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lahore, Punjab Province, India, 24th] The Punjab Provincial Government today banned the Muslim League's paramilitary volunteer group, the National Guard, and detained eight high-ranking Muslim League officials. Police wielding batons charged a group of Muslim League members, resulting in riots. No fewer than 200 people were injured. The Muslim League expressed its outrage at the government's actions. The Bombay Muslim League has called on 2.5 million Muslims throughout the province to strike this Saturday to protest. Muslims held a mass rally in Bombay tonight to protest the government's ban on gatherings of more than five people. The implementation of this ban was due to the Indo-Muslim conflicts since last September, which resulted in more than 1,200 deaths. Today's editorial in the Muslim League's newspaper called on the people of Punjab Province to depose the provincial government that hates Muslims. The Punjab Provincial Government announced that the Muslim League's "National Guard" and the Hindu "Youth League" were searched at the same time, but no Hindus were arrested. The provincial government's actions are not aimed at any political party, but only to prevent the expansion of private armies in order to ensure national security. After the news of the searches and arrests was announced, demonstrations appeared in Lahore, chanting anti-government slogans, resulting in clashes with the police. At least 30 people were arrested. The Muslim League Executive Committee of this province is scheduled to meet tomorrow with the Muslim League members of the Provincial Assembly to decide on a course of action. Kamaruddin, leader of an Indian women's group, said: "This is another attempt by the Punjab Provincial Government to eliminate the Muslim League groups by force, but I dare say that these people will never succeed, and the Muslims of India will never yield." Hassan, acting chairman of the Muslim League in this province, said: "Our struggle is neither criminal nor violent. I have been ordered to strike against the ban on public gatherings when necessary, and the people will not retreat even if they are shot." Ali, a Muslim League cabinet member of the interim government, also made a statement here, advising the leaders of this province not to get caught up in the vortex of Indo-Muslim conflict.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Handling the Korean Issue; Rumors that the United Nations Will Be Asked to Resolve It; American Senators Advocate Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 25th] According to reliable sources, officials from the United States State Department and the Army Department in Japan and Korea are now beginning to consider the possibility of entrusting the currently unresolved Korean issue to the United Nations for resolution. The source cautiously pointed out that this consideration is still in its early and formative stages. Even if this move is still in the "consideration stage," it is recognized here that the US-Soviet efforts to resolve the Korean issue have indeed reached a dead end. However, the United Nations may also find it difficult to accept this thorny issue, so this matter will only be referred to the United Nations when it is ultimately impossible to resolve it. It is unanimously believed here that some measures should be taken, because the 38th parallel has been an obstacle to the country's economic recovery for 17 months since the US-Soviet joint occupation of Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] Syngman Rhee, leader of the conservative party in the US military occupation zone in southern Korea, today bluntly denounced the "ambiguous elements" in the State Department for obstructing the United States from fulfilling its promise to grant Korea independence, but refused to say who these ambiguous elements were. Rhee said that these people are hindering the execution of the American policy towards Korea and feel that they are inclined towards communism, but since General Marshall was transferred to Secretary of State, he has heard that these people will leave the State Department.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 24th] Senator Hickenlooper, Chairman of the Senate Atomic Energy Committee and a Republican senator, told reporters that there are many contradictory rumors about the situation in Korea, which is really disturbing, so the US Congress really needs to send an investigation team to Korea to conduct an on-site investigation. In addition, Hickenlooper spoke in the Senate today and also requested the Senate to immediately discuss all the activities of the United States in the Far East, especially in Japan and Korea.</p>

We have suffered greatly from the continuous rise in prices over the years, and we are fortunate that it has now ended. The government will continue to complete this task. We will do everything in our power to implement this plan, and the continued development of price suppression movements will eventually punish those who act against the will of the people and thus go bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet Crisis Expected to Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Socialist Workers' Party Holds Dissenting Views</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Rome, 25th] After the Socialist Party leader Nenni issued a declaration last night, proposing new conditions for joining the government, the Italian cabinet crisis has seen a turning point and is expected to be resolved soon. Nenni today expressed his approval of the principles of the coalition government and Premier de Gasperi's plan, and has changed his position after learning that Socialist Workers' Party leader Saragat refused to join the government. De Gasperi told the press that the situation yesterday showed hope for a rapid resolution of the cabinet crisis, and that Nenni and Communist Party leader Togliatti were in agreement with him. Togliatti only requested that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Treasury be merged into a "ministry," but did not object to the abolition of the Post-War Relief Department. After Saragat decided not to join the government, Nenni asked De Gasperi to change his plan and reconsider the allocation of cabinet members. He suggested that the government's plan should meet the needs of the working class and that the Socialist Party should also be given political leadership positions. Nenni's resignation as foreign minister was of decisive significance to himself, and what is most important now is what decision the Republican Party will make at its meeting today.</p>

<h3>American Commander Announces Arctic Combat Conditions</h3>
<p>Human Endurance to Cold Exceeds That of Machinery</p>
<p>[United Press, Somewhere in Alaska, 24th] Colonel Cain, commander of the US Army's "Operation Musk Ox," a special mobile unit in Alaska that tested the endurance of tanks and infantry, proved today that humans can maintain combat capabilities in the Arctic cold, while equipment may not be able to do so. Defensive warfare can be carried out in Alaska, but new tactics are needed. In addition, there must be two shifts of personnel for rotation, and there must be warm tents and hot meals, ample rest opportunities, and care for the injured at the highest speed. As for offensives, strategies such as flanking maneuvers or central breakthroughs are impossible, and only positional warfare can be carried out.</p>
<p>Innocent Victims of the War in Vietnam</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Handling the Korean Issue; Rumors that the United Nations Will Be Asked to Resolve It; American Senators Advocate Thorough Investigation</h3>
<h3>World Economic Trends</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent in the Tea Trade, Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>If one can clearly see the global situation, follow its course and seize opportunities, and leverage external forces from various aspects to achieve our aspirations for "progress," there is no reason why we cannot achieve twice the result with half the effort...</p>
<p>In the global economic landscape of 1947, the United States is in the most advantageous position, while Britain faces significant difficulties. Russia, on the other hand, is seeking opportunities to advance westward. The stalemate between Britain and the United States against Russia regarding Germany is vastly different from the past. In the past, Britain's traditional policy of dealing with the European continent could often achieve great results without spending huge sums; for example, using France to counter Germany, or Germany to counter Russia. Britain was always adept at combining with the "second strongest" power, combining the strength of Britain and the second strongest power to jointly defend against the "strongest," making it easy to win with a two-on-one advantage. By leveraging the tactic of mutual restraint between the two major powers on the European continent, Britain, as the "second," could approach one side during their infighting and easily reap the benefits without much difficulty.</p>
<p>Now, however, times have changed, and it is no longer possible to rely on German military strength to counter Russia as it was a few years ago. Britain and the United States now need a strong military force equivalent to the former German military to forcefully prevent Russia's westward advance. This action requires too much funding, and the United States is now seeking markets overseas, focusing on China and Asia, and not paying much attention to Europe. As a result, Britain must face Russia alone, and each time it struggles precariously.</p>
<p>Recently, the Russian forces advancing from east to west have been making steady progress in the Dardanelles Strait in Turkey, Thessaloniki in Greece, and Trieste in Italy, while the British forces in Egypt, Greece, and Turkey are declining day by day. In the future, European countries such as Italy and France will become strong bases for Russia. The political situation in France is not yet fully stable, while Italy and Spain are both receiving American financial assistance. The progress of post-war reconstruction in Italy will definitely be faster than in France.</p>
<p>In Northern Europe, Russia has expanded its territory to its satisfaction and does not need to seize new territories for the time being. It only seeks to quickly consolidate the territories it has already occupied, establish new industries in all sectors, and become self-sufficient in providing for local workers. Denmark's agricultural products are very abundant, but recently they have been completely bought up by Britain. Belgium is fortunate to have preserved its Congo colony in Africa, and its domestic industry is gradually returning to its original state. Compared to the pre-war 1938 standard of 100%, woolen fabrics have increased by 72%, cotton fabrics by 35%, linen fabrics by 22%, and mixed fabrics by 18%. The purchase of clothing fabrics has been exempted from distribution restrictions.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, after the signing of the Dutch-Indonesian peace agreement on November 18 last year, the securities of all East Indies colonial enterprises suddenly depreciated in the domestic market, falling by a quarter of their original value. The Dutch headquarters has invested a total of 4 trillion Dutch guilders in shipping companies and factories in the East Indies colonies. Due to the lack of goods coming by sea, domestic docks and factories relying on colonial raw materials for manufacturing have all fallen into a state of stagnation. Moreover, the number of colonial people is several times that of the Dutch headquarters. It is not easy to win quickly by using force in the colonies. During the two-sided war, agriculture and industry suffer the most. To quickly restore the original state, a large amount of capital is needed, and it is necessary to communicate with the United States. However, for its own convenience, the United States would rather lend directly to the newly established democratic government of the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands lacks both people and capital, making it difficult to retain the wealth and resources of the East Indies. As a result, among its nine trillion people, five trillion may still need to be relocated abroad. Its suffering seems to be somewhat similar to that of Germany.</p>
<p>Britain finds it difficult to repay its American debts, and its combined territories and colonies form a large-scale economic group, seeking to rely on the sale of export goods to repay its American debts. Unfortunately, this idea contradicts the United States' intention to seize markets, resulting in a lack of quick and effective results.</p>
<p>The United States places the greatest emphasis on China in its efforts to seize overseas markets, followed by Japan, then the Dutch East Indies, then India and other parts of Asia. Among them, the South American countries, except for Argentina's meat market, which is in conflict with American business interests, are already under American control.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the abolition of heavy industry monopolies and light industry, with the intention of using the export of children's toys to pay off the consumption of the British and American occupation forces in Germany and Japan. The newly established American toy industry during the war can be a strong competitor. The goods of Germany and Japan are of high quality and low price, which is tantamount to competing with American goods for markets, and is another contradiction in the economic world. It is said that American industrialists are already planning countermeasures and dreaming of devaluing and dumping their goods.</p>
<p>Wars often arise from commerce. Those who follow the will of Heaven prosper, and those who defy it perish. We Chinese should cultivate virtue and value culture, not forgetting that we are weak. If we can clearly see the global situation, follow its course and seize opportunities, adjust our sails to the wind, and leverage external forces from various aspects to achieve our aspirations for "progress," there is no reason why we cannot achieve twice the result with half the effort. If we are only exploited by one side, like the frequent uprisings in the semi-colonies of Central and South America, it is not enough to harm others, and there will be more than enough self-inflicted disasters.</p>
<p>Today, China is like an outstanding woman who has suddenly been loved by a powerful friendly nation. Compared to Germany and Japan, who cannot succeed whether they go forward or backward, there is a vast difference between heaven and earth. It is the right time for the Chinese to adjust their sails to the wind, and it is extremely easy and supremely wise to follow the trend.</p>
<p>My intention is by no means to favor the United States. I ask, in today's world, who else besides the United States has the remaining strength and leisure to sincerely help us? Who else loves and values us more than the United States? Our people's livelihood is declining, and everything needs to be rebuilt. If we can take advantage of the fact that a friendly nation has fallen in love with us and quickly arrange for planned loans, we can increase the purchasing power of the people and promote Chinese export goods that do not conflict with the United States. Regarding the absorption of American goods as an urgent need for temporary solutions, and using education and incentives to place knowledgeable intellectuals and improve the knowledge of the people as the key to fundamental solutions for absorbing American goods, wouldn't national interests and the people's welfare advance together as a result?</p>

Therefore, we respond to the call of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and other legal entities, and jointly appeal, urging fellow countrymen across the country to unite as one, urge the government and the CCP to immediately ceasefire on the spot, spare no sacrifice, implement the proposition thoroughly, and make those who possess military power and act independently realize that public opinion cannot be insulted and that military force cannot be relied upon, so that they have to change their ways and move towards the right track of political struggle. We hope that the government and the CCP will respect public opinion, heed our suggestions, and realize peaceful unification as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>防疫 Committee Holds General Meeting, Zhang Wei Emphatically Calls for Strengthening Port Quarantine, Hong Kong Smallpox Patients Have Already Mixed into the City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee held a general meeting at the YMCA in Baxianqiao yesterday afternoon. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei, Epidemic Prevention Division Director Chen Bangxian, municipal councilors, and prominent figures from all walks of life, totaling over a hundred people, attended. The meeting was chaired by Mayor Wu, who emphasized the importance of vaccination to prevent smallpox in his address. Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei then reported on the implementation of mandatory vaccination in the city, stating that the city's population is estimated at four million, excluding the elderly and weak, who account for 30 percent. Those who should be vaccinated this year account for 3.2 million people, to be completed in two phases, with 2 million in the first half of the year and 1.2 million in the second half of the year. Vaccination is planned to be carried out in the spring and autumn seasons. The implementation dates, as decided yesterday, are changed as follows: (1) The spring vaccination period will be from February 1st to 9th for the promotion period, using slogans, announcements, newspaper advertisements, movies, and speeches to raise public awareness. February 9th to March 15th will be the first phase of the general mobilization, adopting a persuasion approach. April 15th to May 15th will be the second phase of the general mobilization, forcibly implementing vaccination and conducting a general inspection of land and water transportation and citywide spring vaccination certificates. (2) The autumn vaccination period will be from September 16th to 20th for the announcement period. September 21st to October 31st will be the first phase of the general mobilization. November 1st to November 30th will be the second phase of the general mobilization. The methods are the same as in the spring.</p>
<p>Later, the person in charge of the Seaport Quarantine Station reported that in November last year, a seven-year-old child with smallpox was discovered on a ship from Hong Kong to Shanghai. After a thorough investigation, it was found that his vaccination certificate was forged. A similar situation occurred two weeks ago, and the matter has been handed over to the Hong Kong government. Therefore, it is hoped that the city will be especially cautious when issuing vaccination certificates. According to the rules of the Seaport Quarantine Station, if smallpox patients are found in a certain area,</p>
<p>When the number reaches thirty, it will be declared a smallpox area. Between December 21st and, the number of smallpox patients reached 1,474. The Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station declared Hong Kong a smallpox epidemic port on November 8th.</p>
<p>Director Zhang loudly appealed at yesterday's meeting, saying that Hong Kong is only separated by a body of water, and smallpox is now rampant with a very high mortality rate. Therefore, the traffic inspection work must be strengthened! We absolutely do not want to bring diseases into this city from other places. After hearing this, the mayor nodded in agreement and asked all sectors to work hard to promote this. He stated that if no smallpox is found in the city in the future, it will be due to the efforts of everyone; if unfortunately any is found, it will be our shame.</p>
<p>Also, it was decided at yesterday's meeting that citizens aged 50 and over will not be subject to the mandatory vaccination measures, but this is only limited to within the city. If traveling abroad, they must still be vaccinated one week in advance.</p>

Two pieces of dry bread were placed on the long stool. Wang held her stomach with both hands and complained of stomach pain, asking the prison staff to give her boiling water to quench her thirst. Some people sympathized with her, but others pointed out that she was a female con artist, claiming that she was faking illness and did not need to be paid attention to. It was not until 4:35 pm that a bailiff accompanied Wang to hire a taxi to take her out of the prison with her bail. In the evening, this sensational female con artist regained her freedom.</p>

Bureau Director Li Guofan, Section Chief Chen Guangzhe, Wang Muzong, Customs Port Director Yuan Jun, and the responsible persons of the two companies attended. The captain of the Zhijiang ship, Xin Chengfang, and the captain of the Huatong ship, Zhang Jinsheng, were escorted to the scene by the District Prosecutor's Office to describe the circumstances of the collision. The meeting lasted until 7 pm. After detailed inquiries and judgments, it was decided that the Zhijiang ship was at fault for its wrong course, and should bear 80% of the responsibility. The Huatong ship's towing barges on both sides did not comply with the Port Affairs Law, and should bear 20% of the responsibility. All losses will be shared by the two companies according to this ratio.</p>
<p>It is also learned that more than ten representatives of local sailors went to the Navigation Administration Bureau yesterday morning to request the release of the captains of the Zhijiang and Huatong ships. Director Li received them and expressed his agreement, but because the two captains are currently detained by the District Prosecutor's Office, the Navigation Administration Bureau plans to issue a letter requesting their release.</p>
<p>Zhijiang Ship to Bear 80% of the Responsibility for Traveling the Wrong Course</p>
<p>As for the salvage of the Zhijiang ship, after inspection by the Customs Port Authority, it was found that the water flow at the sinking site was very rapid, which would be a costly project, so it will be put out to tender.</p>

<h3>A Large Number of Robbers Caught in the Net - Guns and Original Stolen Goods Recovered - Headquarters Located at Panjiasha Outside Wusongkou</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Xiao Fuquan, the Director of the Huxi District Investigation Office of the Songhu Garrison Command Investigation Department, recently received a secret report stating that a large number of robbers were hiding in the urban area, committing many crimes, and possessing weapons such as carbine rifles. He immediately dispatched Deputy Director Zhang Wenming, Director Wang Jingwen, and Intelligence Section Chief Yang Weibin to conduct investigations. After spending more than ten days, they finally discovered that the gang had set up a secret room at Room 609 of the Jinshan Hotel on Guangxi Road on the 15th of this month. Action Section Chief Yan Jinwen immediately led officers such as Zhai Gengchun to arrest the robber Chen Linqi. He confessed that the gang leader Zhang Shicai was hiding in Room 520 of the Wugong Hotel. When they went there, the suspect had already fled upon hearing the news, and only his mistress Tang Dayuan was apprehended. Subsequently, they went to Room 414 of the Yangtze Hotel to arrest the remaining members, but were unsuccessful. They then rushed to Wusong overnight and finally captured the gang leader Zhang Yancai inside No. 105 Hefeng Road, confiscating dozens of bullets and box gun cartridge belts. After interrogation, they apprehended accomplices Fan Zhiming, Huang Nianxiu, Yang Heshang, and Zhang Mulang at the Wusong Wushang Inn. They confessed that the headquarters was located at Panjiasha, 40 li away from the Wusongkou sea area. They immediately took the suspect Fan Zhiming there and recovered a carbine rifle, hundreds of bullets, two telescopes, and three hand grenades from a thatched house. They also arrested Huang Wangjin and Zhu Xilang, two robbers guarding the firearms, and Zhou Aibao, a receiver of stolen goods, bringing the total number of men and women arrested to ten. After the office interrogated each suspect one by one, they confessed to committing numerous robberies from December of last year to January of this year without denying it. The most recent incident was the robbery of Wei Yuren's home at No. 10 Qianjia Lane, Yangjiadu, Pudong, where they stole 104 salted pigs, 12 bundles of vermicelli, peanuts, cabbage, and other items, worth more than 50 million yuan. Some of the stolen goods were also recovered the day before yesterday. The case was fully investigated yesterday and immediately sent to the Garrison Command Military Law Department for trial.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Machine Factory Embezzlement Case of UNRRA - Indictment Full Text</h3>
<p>Two UNRRA Staff Suspected of Stealing and Selling Will Be Tried for the First Time by Our Country's Courts</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The UNRRA Zhenru Machine Factory embezzlement case has been investigated and concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office, and a public prosecution has been filed. The handling prosecutor believes that although Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are UNRRA staff members, they were borrowed by UNRRA and supervised by the Chinese government, engaging in public service. Their status as public officials has been confirmed. In the worst case, the two are also persons entrusted by public institutions to handle matters. Article 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption states: "Soldiers, public officials, or persons entrusted by public institutions to handle matters who commit crimes under these regulations during wartime shall be punished in accordance with these regulations. The same applies to non-military or public officials who are accomplices." Therefore, the defendants Xi Zhi, Xie Piluo, Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Cao Chiming, Qian Zhengfu, and others jointly encroached upon and stole for sale, violating Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption: "Those who steal for sale, encroach upon, or steal public property shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for seven years or more." In particular, Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo continued to steal and sell. According to Article 56 of the Criminal Law: "Whoever continuously commits the same crime through multiple acts shall be deemed to have committed one crime, but the sentence may be increased by up to one-half." Therefore, if the crimes committed by Xi Zhi, Xie Piluo, and others are true, they will be punished jointly in accordance with Article 50 of the Criminal Law, and the sentencing will inevitably be severe in the future. The fact that UNRRA staff members are tried and punished by our country's courts will begin with Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo. The full text of the indictment is published below:</p>
<p>Defendants:</p>
<p>Xi Zhi, male, 46 years old, Australian, residing at No. 165 Maiyang Road, Occupation: Deputy Director of Factory.</p>
<p>Xie Piluo, male, 34 years old, Polish, residing at No. 35 Tailatuo Road, Occupation: Director of Factory Affairs.</p>
<p>Yang Shenghuan, male, 34 years old, Hunanese, residing at No. 70 Lane, 84 Xianyang Road, Occupation: Staff of UNRRA Zhenru Machine Factory.</p>
<p>Li Luoshi, male, 21 years old, Cantonese, residing at No. 16, Lane 97, Meibaike Road, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.</p>
<p>Ma Shiyi, male, 21 years old, Hebei native, residing at No. 14, Lane 97, Meibaike Road, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.</p>
<p>Qian Zhengfu, male, 23 years old, Jiading native, residing at No. 21, Lane 102, Zhongzheng North Road, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.</p>
<p>Cao Chiming, male, 36 years old, Zhejiang native, residing at No. 7, Fuxingli, North Zhangjia Lane, Nanshi, Occupation: Staff of Zhenru Machine Factory.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned defendants are involved in a case of suspected corruption (Case No. 5755 of Zhenjia in the 35th year). After investigation, the prosecution is filed because it is deemed:</p>
<p>Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are both staff members of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), borrowed by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Xi Zhi is the deputy director of the Zhenru Machinery Assembly Factory of the administration, and Xie Piluo is the director of the factory's affairs. On July 22 of last year, Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo stole and sold 55 boxes of five-plywood from the factory to Huang Zhangbin of the Daxing Construction Company, obtaining US$11,000. In November of the same year, they, together with Yang Shenghuan, the leader of the factory's material distribution group, Li Luoshi, the field manager, Ma Shiyi, Yang's assistant and cargo inspector, and Cao Chiming, the auditor, jointly stole and sold 10 boxes of aluminum sheets from the factory to Li Siheng, the owner of the Jingcheng Hardware Store, obtaining 11 million yuan. In the same month, Xi Zhi, together with Qian Zhengfu, the leader of the material allocation group, stole and sold 10 boxes of aluminum sheets to Wang Xiansheng, the owner of the China-US Oil Company, and divided the proceeds, which led to their transfer to the office.</p>
<p>The defendants Xi Zhi, Xie Piluo, Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, and Ma Shiyi have already confessed to the above-mentioned facts. The process of how they discussed it, how they obtained the proceeds, how they distributed them, how they were discovered, and how they were arrested is described in detail, as if they were drawing a picture. In addition, witnesses Zhu Jiade, Deng Tuolai, and Hui Desheng testified in court about the investigation and investigation process in great detail. There is also evidence of the US dollar bill and legal tender of the stolen money sent to the case, a note from Daxing Construction Company applying to purchase 4-foot, 8-and-a-half-inch five-plywood, a receipt for US$11,000 signed by Australian Xi Zhi to Daxing Construction Company, UNRRA Machine Factory Nos. 26, 42, and 58 delivery orders, and invoices for aluminum sheets, etc. It is beyond doubt that they jointly stole and sold public property. The defendant Qian Zhengfu quibbled with his words, but it has been clearly indicated by Xi Zhi how he negotiated with Xi Zhi to steal and sell 10 boxes of aluminum sheets. It has also been stated by Ma Shiyi and Yang Shenghuan how he took the 10 boxes of aluminum sheets that he stole out of the factory. It is difficult to deny. The defendant Cao Chiming is responsible for the inspection of material receipt and distribution. If he did not collude with them, how could the aluminum sheets without a delivery permit be allowed to be loaded and shipped out of the factory? Since the defendant admitted that he was suspicious, why did he not report it for investigation? Based on the testimony of witness Zhu Jiade, when he went to inquire at the time, the defendant looked flustered and spoke evasively, indicating that he was suspected of jointly stealing. Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Cao Chiming, and Qian Zhengfu are all staff members of UNRRA, and there is no doubt that they are public officials. Although Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are staff members of UNRRA and receive salaries from UNRRA, they are borrowed by UNRRA and supervised by the Chinese government, and are engaged in public service. They must be recognized as having the status of public officials. Even if we take a step back, because they are UNRRA employees and receive salaries from UNRRA, we cannot consider them to be public officials. They are also persons entrusted by public institutions to handle matters. According to the provisions of Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, if they have engaged in acts of encroachment upon or theft for sale of public property, they should also be punished in accordance with the regulations. Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo are responsible for the custody of the factory's public property. They jointly encroached upon and stole for sale with Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Cao Chiming, Qian Zhengfu, etc., in violation of Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 3, Section 2 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption. Xi Zhi and Xie Piluo stole and sold aluminum sheets twice, with only a few days in between, indicating that they had an overall intention to commit the crime. There is no doubt that they are serial offenders under Article 56 of the Criminal Code. However, Xi Zhi's theft and sale of five-plywood in July of last year and the theft and sale of aluminum sheets were separated by several months, and it is believed that the intent to commit the crime was different. They should be punished jointly in accordance with Article 50 of the same law. All the stolen public property will be handled in accordance with Article 7 of the Regulations on Punishment of Corruption, and a public prosecution will be filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<h3>American Military Remains in China Theater - 2,500 Bodies Have Been Found - More Than 400 Unidentified</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Major Allersmith, Director of the American Military Cemetery Registration Office in the China Theater, stated here yesterday morning that the office has now discovered a total of 2,575 bodies of American military personnel, which were found in Taiwan, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shenyang, Kunming, Chengdu, and Shanghai. Among them, about 1,760 bodies have been identified, and the identities of 455 are being checked by the US Army Department.</p>
<p>A total of 420 coffins of American military personnel have been found in Taiwan, but some coffins contain more than one body. Forty bodies were found in Qingdao, and 260 bodies were found in Shenyang, including two bodies of British military personnel and one body of an Australian military personnel. Eight hundred and sixty bodies were found in Kunming, 325 in Chengdu, and 525 in the Shanghai cemetery.</p>
<p>Major Smith said that the work of identifying these bodies is extremely slow and difficult. He said that the office plans to send some personnel to Germany for research because the method of identifying bodies used there is faster.</p>
<p>About 400 of the bodies found in Taiwan were American prisoners of war who were bombed by American aircraft while being transported from the Philippines to Japan on two Japanese ships. It is reported that one Japanese ship originally carried 1,700 American prisoners of war from the Philippines to Japan and was bombed outside the Philippine Islands. As a result, 560 American prisoners died. The survivors were carried on another Japanese ship, which was bombed again by American aircraft on January 9, 1945, killing 200 people. According to Japanese documents, the bombed bodies were originally intended to be cremated, but due to the major bombing by American aircraft, it could not be implemented, and they were buried together in a large tomb 75 feet long and 18 feet wide.</p>
<h3>Deeds, Delivery Orders, and Bills Should Be Stamped in Accordance with the Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, for shipping deeds, delivery orders, and bills issued for meals, dishes, and beverages sold on ships and trains, should be stamped in accordance with the law. Notice to all member stores of the guilds: It is approved by the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in the letter Hu Zhi Si Zi No. 218 of the 18th of this month, which states that the Ministry of Finance and Direct Taxation Office issued Instruction No. 16822 of Jing San Zi, stating that shipping deeds and delivery orders of transportation agencies should be stamped separately by the issuers in accordance with Item 21 of the Stamp Tax Rate Table. In addition, bills issued for meals, dishes, and beverages sold on ships and trains should also be stamped in accordance with Item 3 of the Tax Rate Table. It is reported that the issuers of the above-mentioned documents have mostly failed to stamp them in accordance with the law, and the stamp inspection and sampling personnel in various places have also neglected to check them at any time, resulting in a huge amount of stamp tax evasion, which is very wrong. In addition to separate orders, it is necessary to order the bureau to quickly transfer it to its subordinate agencies and strictly investigate it at any time and place, and to report the inspection situation in accordance with the regulations. This order, etc., should be complied with, in addition to separate letters, the corresponding letter reaches, that is, I hope your guild will check it.</p>
<h3>Social Service - Donate One More Penny, Save One More Life</h3>
<p>Everyone Practiced Thrift During the Spring Festival, Saving More People Brings Great Fortune</p>
<p>Yesterday, this column published an appeal for the people who are lonely, widowed, poor, and sick, hoping that everyone would save as much as possible during the Spring Festival and help the poor compatriots as much as possible, so that they can get some help in this season of snow and severe cold. Although there are so many poor compatriots and our strength is so weak, I believe that as long as everyone works together and enthusiastically contributes, we can definitely accumulate a considerable amount, and at the same time enable more suffering compatriots to receive assistance. As the ancient saying goes, "Many grains of sand form a pagoda, and many furs make a coat." No matter what the matter is, as long as we gather the strength of the masses to do it, it will never fail. Now we only need to adhere to the purpose of "donate one more penny, save one more life," eliminate all unnecessary expenses, and donate the money saved to our poor compatriots. The so-called "giving charcoal in the snow" is exactly what it means. At the same time, I think the compatriots who receive alms will definitely express their heartfelt thanks.</p>

<h3>Inspecting Cotton Yarn Quality - Textile Control Passed Sampling Method</h3>
<p>And Urge Each Yarn Factory to Report Finished Products for Purchase - Purchase of Foreign Cotton is Limited to 20 Count and Above Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The 21st regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held in the city government conference room at 10:00 AM yesterday. The attendees were Wu,兼 Chairman, Li,副 Chairman, and committee members Shu Yunchang, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, and Liu Wenteng, the director of the Textile Control Committee's business office. The attendees were Fang Dong, the director of the Goods Tax Bureau, and Rong Yixin. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>There were three important motions: (1) Urging each yarn factory to quickly report the number of finished products that should be purchased by the government. The Textile Control Committee has issued a yarn factory daily report and a weekly cotton yarn sales notice, but each yarn factory has not yet filled it out, so the committee cannot issue a notice of approval and entrustment to purchase cotton yarn based on the verification. It is now decided to ask the factory personnel stationed in each yarn factory by the Goods Tax Bureau to urge each factory to quickly fill out and report the production situation from January 1 of this year to the present. (2) Each yarn factory, regardless of its size, must be limited to spinning 20 count and above cotton yarn if it wants to purchase foreign cotton. At the same time, it must allocate half of the finished product to the government for purchase in accordance with the cotton yarn purchase method set by the committee. The quality of the finished product must meet the predetermined inspection standards, otherwise, the purchase price will be proportionally reduced. (3) Passed the seven articles of the cotton yarn quality inspection sampling method and decided to implement it from the 27th of this month. The items are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The quality inspection of cotton yarn produced by each factory shall be organized by the committee.</p>
<p>Article 2: Each time a cotton yarn quality inspection is conducted, the committee will send personnel to each factory to take yarn samples in accordance with the prescribed method, seal them, and bring them to the committee for inspection.</p>
<p>Article 3: The method for taking yarn samples from each factory is listed below: (A) In the fine yarn room of each factory that spins each brand of yarn count, the sampling personnel shall randomly select 20 yarn tubes from each car for testing, such as raw yarn weight, tension, evenness, twist, and moisture. (B) In the packaging room of each factory, the sampling personnel shall randomly select one skein of light and heavy yarn from each brand and count of cotton yarn (i.e., 10 Hank) for inspecting length and skein content. (C) In the packaging room of each factory, the sampling personnel shall randomly select one pile (i.e., ten pounds) from each brand and count of finished yarn for testing color and packaging.</p>
<p>Article 4: After all the yarn samples are collected, the sampling personnel shall mark the brand number at any time, and ask each factory to assist in packaging, packing, and sealing the box, and at the same time ask the person in charge of the factory to sign the seal on the box to ensure caution.</p>
<p>Article 5: The seal shall be prepared by the committee.</p>
<p>Article 6: The method for inspecting cotton yarn quality shall be formulated and implemented separately.</p>
<p>Article 7: If there are any shortcomings in this method, it may be submitted to the committee meeting at any time for resolution and modification.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The responsible authority of the Central Bank stated that the silver shops in this city raised the listed price of jewelry to 440,000 yuan per tael on Lunar New Year's Eve. In fact, the highest distribution price of the Central Bank on that day was only 400,300 yuan per tael for the 10条, and most of the others were distributed within 400,000 yuan. It is evident that the silver shops are suspected of raising prices for profit. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated, limiting the listed price of jewelry in each silver shop to not exceed 20,000 yuan beyond the distribution price of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Impacted by Stable Gold Prices: Chinese Stocks are all Flourishing</h3>
<p>The Chinese general issues were sluggish yesterday but then improved; the small issues even more so. Yong Shas and “Bo” (likely a typo of “Bu” 簿) stocks reached new highs. Initially, the market opened lower due to weakness in the gold market. After the opening, apart from the futures market, issues 91, 104, 44, and 97 immediately purchased cash Yong Shas, while issues 85, 232, 155, and 97 also purchased forward Yong Shas, pushing the forward Yong Sha price up to 844 yuan. The futures market was posted by financial firms issues 45 and 220, etc. The Yong Sha posting price was between 21 and 22 yuan, equivalent to a daily interest rate of about 1.8 cents. Issue 198 sold, while issues 156 and 231 cashed out Yong Shas, causing a temporary drop of 10 yuan. Issues 232, 155, and 89 continued to purchase, and issues 35, 224, 14, and 97 repeatedly purchased cash Yong Shas. Near noon, the overall price rose sharply, with forward Yong Shas rising to 860 yuan. New Asia once hit the limit up. Issue 145 had high supply and fell back slightly. In the end, Yong Shas closed slightly higher than the previous closing price. Xinhe, Jingfu, Xinguang, and Qinxing each rose more than half a percent, while Huafeng and Meiya rose more than one and a half percent. In the forward market, Yong Shas, Meiya, and Xinguang each rose more than half a percent, and Huafeng rose one and a half percent. Cold stocks continued to rise slightly. Off-market, various stocks were quoting for old-tier year-end prices.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Distributes Over Two Thousand Bars: Gold Price Ultimately Rises by Ten Thousand</h3>
<p>Raw gold was quite stable yesterday. Although the Central Bank supplied, it was difficult to satisfy buying appetite. It initially fell low and then rose high. The morning opening saw prices as low as 4.04 million yuan for sale. Later, due to pressure and supply relationships, it once fell to around 3.95 million yuan. The Central Bank immediately distributed 2392 bars at this price. Subsequently, buyers and those with surplus funds searched, and the supply source decreased, gradually rebounding. At noon, it once rose to over 4.1 million yuan, resulting in a rise of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the Central Bank's restriction that silver shops could only add 20,000 yuan to the allocated gold, yesterday's price for jewelry gold was 415,000 yuan. Silver was still stable. Money exchange businesses had not yet opened. Foreign currency quotations had no significant changes. The Hong Kong exchange rate also had supply at 1340 yuan, with an implied interest rate of about 1.5 cents?</p>
<h3>Autumn Silk Purchase Begins: Simple Procedures, Purchase Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>After the autumn silk cost was verified and approved by President Song, the Central Bank, in order to provide relief to silk manufacturers for the Spring Festival settlement and to deduct various loan arrears, notified the Autumn Cocoon Loan Administration Office and the China Trust Bureau and the China Agricultural Bank on the 21st at 2 PM to begin purchasing. On the first day, a total of 275 loads of autumn silk and mixed spring silk were purchased. In the past two days, another 200 loads were purchased. According to Sun Bohe, Director of the Autumn Cocoon Loan Administration Office, the estimated output of autumn silk and mixed dried spring silk in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in the 35th year is about 3,000 loads. Of these, 660 loads of autumn silk and 225 loads of mixed dried spring silk have been reeled and passed inspection. The rest are currently being reeled, inspected, and transported. The procedures for purchasing autumn silk this time are simplified for convenience: purchase is done upon arrival, and there is no specified date for remittance. When silk manufacturers want to sell, they can receive payment by presenting a warehouse receipt from the Loan Administration Office to the China Trust Bureau. It is expected that this work will be completed in no more than a month.</p>
<h3>Import Provisional Management Committee Announces Number of Licenses Issued</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the Executive Committee of the Import Provisional Management Committee has issued licenses for import applications for goods ordered before November 17, 35th year, but not yet declared for import, which belong to categories two and three in the attached schedule, accounting for 98% of all applications.

<h3>Miscellaneous News from the New Year Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth red market was stable, with no transactions. Fangjian Company's cotton cloth was also not available for sale.

<p>For daily necessities, trading was still scarce at the morning opening, with quotations similar to last weekend.</p>
<p>Among Western medicines, saccharin and quinine quotations rose slightly, while others remained stable.</p>
<h3>China Trust to Establish Tea Evaluation Committee: Decides to Purchase Tea for Export</h3>
<p>Tea Collection Limited to Shipment to Shanghai Before the End of This Month</p>
<p>The issue of collecting tea leaves for export in this city had been requested by tea merchants to be held before the Lunar New Year so they could get through the New Year. But for various reasons, this was not realized. In order to relieve merchants and the people, the government is handling the acceptance of drafts through the China Agricultural Bank so tea merchants can barely get by with difficulty. According to personnel responsible for this matter at the China Trust Bureau, it has now been decided to adopt the method of the former China Agricultural Corporation for purchasing tea leaves. The tea evaluation committee will be established soon. In addition to the designated personnel participating, two foreign businessmen will be hired as consultants. The purchase of tea leaves is limited to those shipped to Shanghai before the end of this month. The evaluation work will begin at the latest at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>The Red Market for Sugar is Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for sugar red market was stable.

Although the price of Qing sugar was raised to 110,000 yuan, there were no transactions. There was also a lack of activity for other sugars, and trading in the market was very quiet.</p>
<h3>A Large Amount of Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai at the end of the Lunar New Year. It was the Zhaoshang Bureau's "Hai Lie" (likely a typo for 海列, a ship name) coming from Bangkok (a typo of 曼谷, Bangkok, here, meaning "Shanghai"). It contained 8,500 tons (85,000 bags). The ship sailed on December 21 of last year and returned to Shanghai this Monday (20th). It is currently docked at buoys 7 and 8 for unloading and transfer. It is said that this large amount of foreign rice was purchased by the China Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Rise in Nanchang</h3>

<h3>Speaker Pan's Opinion: Private School Tuition Issues Should be Legally Resolved; Resolutions Cannot be Changed Except by Submitting for Reconsideration According to Law</h3>
<p>Private primary and secondary school principals and teachers in this city published advertisements in newspapers yesterday, issuing declarations stating that the City Council's resolution setting the tuition fees for private schools in the 36th year at 130,000 yuan for primary schools, 170,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 220,000 yuan for senior high schools was an arbitrary regulation that disregards the livelihoods of teachers. The reporter interviewed City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan specifically about this matter, asking for his opinion. According to his response: This case was submitted for discussion by the municipal government. All cases submitted by the mayor should be discussed and voted on according to law by the City Council. All resolutions are decided by the majority. This is the general practice of parliaments in democratic countries. The case was discussed for two days, and the proceedings were reported in the newspapers. It was not easy to pass with an addition. This is a fact witnessed by councilors from the teaching profession and reporters present. To say that it is an arbitrary regulation that disregards the livelihoods of teachers is probably not entirely true. Teachers' lives are hard, and parents bear a heavy burden. It is difficult to satisfy both parties. In recent years, prices have risen continuously. Although running schools is difficult, if the private school economy is absolutely transparent and fully subject to legal supervision by the government, how can the true difficult situation be understood by everyone? I believe it will be more likely to gain the support of parents and the sympathy of society. As for whether the resolutions of the City Council should be complied with, it is the responsibility of the government. If there are obstacles, there is no other way to change it except to submit it for reconsideration according to law. There are many eloquent people in our education field, and I sincerely hope that they can be calm and seek a legal solution to the problem.</p>
<h3>Private School Teachers in this City to Petition the Council Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Demanding Increased Education Funding</p>
<p>Representatives of private primary and secondary school teachers in this city are scheduled to petition the City Council, the Municipal Government, and the Education Bureau tomorrow (27th) morning, demanding improved teacher treatment, increased education funding in the city, accounting for 35% of the city budget, and subsidizing private school teachers with half of the funds. It is said that students in private schools account for 85% of middle school students and 67% of primary school students in this city, but the current subsidy for private schools is only 3%, which has not yet been distributed.</p>
<h3>Dr. Zhu Kezhen Discusses: Chinese Students Lack Practical Experience; Advocates Integrating Mind and Hand to Seek Practicality</h3>
<p>[UK News Agency, London, 24th] Dr. Zhu Kezhen, the Chinese representative attending the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and President of National Zhejiang University, has arrived in London, visiting renowned British educational institutions and professional personnel. The reporter recently visited President Zhu during his travels and received the following statement: I was born in 1890 and studied geology and metallurgy at Tangshan Engineering College, Harvard University, and the University of Illinois. However, decades of educational experience have led me to believe that current higher education should emphasize practicality and reduce empty talk about systems. There is too much specialization in today's education law, so Chinese students only know theory and lack practical experience after returning to the country. This is a major educational crisis. In other words, students lack a basic education and cannot integrate mind and hand. Therefore, I am taking this opportunity to attend the UNESCO conference to come to England and observe the general British education law for comparison. I believe that too much compartmentalized education cannot raise today's living standards in China. The result may be that there are books. As for the educational institutions in England, although Oxford and Cambridge Universities are too classical, they attach great importance to practical education. I initially saw that ordinary schools in England lacked equipment, but this also has its advantages, because students must use both mind and hand to seek knowledge. Conversely, if everything must rely on machines, then mind and hand cannot develop simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Student Unrest at Wuhan University Subsides: All Classes to Resume Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Hankou, 25th] The student unrest at Wuhan University has, in fact, been quelled since the Student Self-Government Association issued a public letter. In order to seek a thorough solution, the association, with the consent of the majority of students on Lunar New Year's Eve, sent representatives to meet with President Zhou, expressing a firm desire to retain him. Zhou has agreed to consider and announced to students that classes will resume on the 24th, pending resolution by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, some students have already started classes today, and all classes should resume on the 27th. However, the requested demobilization subsidy for students remains unresolved.</p>
<h3>It will be Difficult to Add Grades to Municipal National Schools this Semester</h3>
<p>Because the City Budget has not yet been Decided</p>
<p>The budget for the 36th year has not yet been approved by the City Council. The Accounting Department of the Municipal Government has notified all departments that expenses can only be handled according to the budget for the 35th year. New projects will be postponed for the time being. Therefore, it will be difficult to add grades to municipal national schools this semester. It is reported that local people in various suburban districts have independently prepared school buildings and school supplies and requested the Education Bureau to open national schools. There are already more than 20 schools. More than 100 grades have been requested to be added to various central national schools and Bao national schools, but due to budget constraints, they cannot be established or added. However, on the school side, because the number of applicants is unusually crowded, maintaining the original state of the 35th year is impossible. It is reported that some principals will go to the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Government, and the City Council to petition separately, so that the school can decide to add grades before the start of school to accommodate out-of-school children.</p>
<h3>Rockefeller Foundation Allocates Final Donation to Assist Peiping Union Medical College</h3>

<h3>Zuo Shunsheng Suggests that the Authorities Establish Constitutional Lectures in all Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that Zuo Shunsheng suggested to Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Wu Dingchang, and others during his time in Beijing that constitutional lectures should be universally established in universities. Chinese political scholars should lecture on the content of our constitution and the history of constitutionalism in order to enhance young people's correct understanding of the constitution and not be misled by propaganda. At the same time, constitutional courses should also be added in middle schools so that students can understand the foundation of the country. Zuo also pointed out that French children aged twelve already have declarations of human rights in their textbooks, which is something that our country should emulate. It is said that Zhang, Chen, and Wu all expressed their agreement.</p>

Education Bureau Director Gu has submitted a request to the Municipal Government, which has been approved, to select a site for the construction of a school building as a model for celebrating the birthday of the school's founder. Mayor Wu has personally indicated his permission. It is also reported that the Education Bureau has sent personnel to consult with the Land Administration Bureau to allocate a public land within the 12th district for the construction of the school. Once the school building design is decided, they will contact the Public Works Bureau to discuss construction methods. The cost is around 200 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match Ends in a Draw Yesterday: Score 0-0, Neither Side Scores; Li Huitang Misses Penalty Kick</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 25th] The Hong Kong-Shanghai interport football match was held here today. At the end of the match, neither side had scored, and the match was not extended due to darkness. Shanghai goalkeeper Zhang Bangyao was the hero of the entire match, saving many dangerous shots. Otherwise, the Shanghai team would have suffered a crushing defeat. During the match, the ball often hovered in the Shanghai team's area. The Hong Kong team's forwards repeatedly broke through the defense line, but were all saved by the goalkeeper. Hong Kong center forward Li Huitang's penalty kick hit Zhang Banglun's palm and did not go into the net. Afterwards, Li said that he did not know why he could not control the ball. However, the general audience knew that Li thought the ball was questionable and deliberately did not kick it in. During the match, two shots that were sure to score hit the Shanghai team's goalposts and bounced out.</p>
<h3>Basketball League Resumes After Holiday: All Black to Fight Giant Today; Green Team vs. Qianghua in Women's Group</h3>
<p>The Second Basketball League had been closed for a week due to the Lunar New Year. The holiday has now passed. Starting at 5:30 PM today, three matches in the men's and women's groups will continue to be held at the Municipal Gymnasium.</p>
<p>The opening act will be a meeting of the women's group, where the Green Team will meet Qianghua. The Green Team has won two consecutive victories and is showing great momentum. Although Qianghua, under the guidance of Lin Weicong, has up-and-coming young players such as Jiang Meiying, Cao Suzhen, Xi Manying, and Cao Manzhu, it is feared that they will still be difficult to resist.</p>
<p>The second match, in Group B of the second division, will be between Green Forest and Team V. The former took the Indian Fanjiang team in the first match and has young players such as Shu Jiayi, Wang Jieping, Chen Zhengsen, and Ye Yunshan. Team V's ball skills are quite impressive, and there will definitely be a dramatic performance.</p>
<p>The headlining match will be in Group A, where Giant will face All Black. All Black has rebuilt its strength this year, but today is only its first match. However, the team's main player Jia Youliang is on a trip to Hong Kong with the interport football team, and it is difficult to gather the team members, so it may be possible to withdraw from the game. However, in order to maintain the spirit of sports, the victory or defeat is not important, and they will try their best to participate. The order of each match is recorded later:</p>
<p>Green Team - Qianghua (Women) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Green Forest - Team V (Group B) 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Giant - All Black (Group A) 7:30 PM</p>

<h3>Facing Up to Our Nation's Drama</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, my letter was published by the editors of this journal. It was merely a private letter, only briefly mentioning certain facts, so naturally it was not very detailed. Now that it has been published, I feel compelled to say a few more words. I have no intention of criticizing Mr. Xuan, but I simply lament that our nation's drama is either blindly praised, blindly attacked, or carelessly handled with irresponsible writing, leading to misinterpretations. Our nation's drama has a history of about seven hundred years, with countless works left behind, and has now diversified into dozens of different forms. Such a huge thing cannot be casually dealt with. Its advantages, disadvantages, strengths, and weaknesses are worth discussing in detail. I will first put forward three points as the basis for the following explanation.</p>
<p>(1) Music is an extremely important element in our nation's drama, or rather, singing is an extremely important element. In various dramas today, from Kunqu Opera (which is actually just a type of singing) to Chu Opera, Yue Opera, and Peking Opera (these are some of the most recently developed dramas, popular for no more than twenty or even a few years), the biggest difference lies only in the singing style, while the script, performance, and stage conditions (including costumes) are only secondary factors. However, the gradual separation of drama from music and its independence is a definite trend, so our nation's drama has reached a point where reform is imperative.</p>
<p>(2) However, the scope of drama is extremely broad, and it is never permissible to stubbornly negate the rest based on a viewpoint of a certain point. From ancient Greece to modern European and American works, there have been many changes. Judging Shakespeare, medieval mystery plays, Aristophanes, or even Molière by the standards of modern drama would be incompatible. But one must objectively admit that these are all dramas, no matter how different they may appear. One must also objectively admit that "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Autumn in the Han Palace," and others have the same value as "A Doll's House," "Hamlet," and "Antigone."</p>
<p>(3) Art must always start from the history and culture of one's own nation. Relying solely on foreign things will never take deep root. Based on my experience of performing in folk dramas for more than six years, I can say that purely Western-style spoken drama does not suit our people very well. We must learn from our own original drama, eliminate the inferior and preserve the superior, and re-create a national form of drama.</p>
<p>However, this is too distant an ideal to be discussed for the moment. At present, I hope to study foreign dramas more accurately, and at the same time, study our own more accurately. First, figure out what this is all about, and then talk about other things. Even if it is thought that it must be abolished, the verdict must be made at that time.</p>
<p>Currently, regarding our nation's drama, only the history of the development of opera music is generally clear. (But I hope that many facts that have already been clarified and determined will not be confused again.) Although there are still some details that have not been determined, they are not major problems. However, there are many other important issues about which we know almost nothing. For example, in terms of scripts, only literary value (including the rules of composition) is studied. But no one has asked about the basic concepts and main methods of structural form for handling content. In terms of form, some places differ from the West, such as the complete disregard for time and space, the lack of conflict between characters, the indistinguishability of tragedy and comedy, and the lengthy forty or fifty act annotations, etc. Very few people pay attention to the development process of theaters and performances, and no one studies the more than thirty existing local operas (which are rich materials).</p>
<p>There are many questions for which I urgently want to know the answers; however, I have neither the academic ability nor the knowledge, and I have not read any texts discussing these questions. Looking around, I can't help but feel melancholy. For example, Lü Tiancheng, Li Yu, and others' theories on playwriting are extremely precise and pay great attention to the stage. Why is the stage performance of our nation's drama not very significant, and why can't Ruan and Li's works be listed alongside Gao, Tang, Kong, and Hong's Yuan drama? The themes of Southern drama before the Ming Dynasty were extremely broad, why did they focus entirely on talented scholars and beautiful ladies after the Ming Dynasty? Guan Hanqing and Huang Jieyuan were about the same age, between them, that is, between Zaju drama and Zhugongdiao, were there any transitional works? Kunqu Opera flourished for about two hundred and fifty years, from the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty to the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, why was it overthrown by the more primitive Luan Tan in terms of script, performance, and singing? Is there a certain general rule for the rise and fall of various dramas? And the rise and fall between various dramas are almost all regressive, that is, the more primitive ones overthrow the more complete ones in terms of technique, why? Various local operas, especially minor operas, such as the aforementioned Chu Opera, etc., have a very large audience, what are their advantages? European mystery plays are quite similar to our nation's drama, but they are probably more immature, why do they each have different developments? Music is originally extremely important, can it be reformed? And so on.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope to face up to our nation's drama. To attack it, we must find the real shortcomings, and we cannot criticize it based on the standards of modern Western drama, saying that there are no lights or sets. Nor can we list certain dramas as having feudal thoughts or being obscene and thieving. Because scenery and lighting are not necessary elements of drama, and we cannot generalize to the entire drama. To praise it, we must find the real advantages, and we cannot fill it with face paint, posture, singing skills, etc. Because these either belong to the actors or are irrelevant to the whole. As for saying how wonderful Wang Shifu's structure is, it is only meant to fool foreign laymen.</p>
<p>I hope that someone will first start with solid material work, and gradually progress to finally understand what our Chinese drama is. In order to allow them to start calmly, I also hope that people who have no intention of pursuing this path will not interfere at all.</p>
<p>June of the thirty-first year, Zhunti Nunnery in Suzhou</p>
<p>At this time, on the contrary, Xu Hui, trapped in Shanghai, which had fallen into enemy hands, not only lost contact with Daojun, but her situation deteriorated and she had to apply for a job as a female employee at Hongkang Company, but she was not hired because she was married, so she had to change her job again and become a tutor in the family of the traitor Lu Zhiming, but Lu was fired by his wife in anger.</p>
<p>As a result, the lives of their mother and daughter were plunged into panic, and they had no choice but to sell their meager furniture and move into a complex neighborhood in a working-class district. Their neighbors included a dancer and the head of the dance hall who lived off the dancer, as well as a crazy old man who thought of his son all day long, and the mother and son of a rickshaw puller named A Gen, who depended on each other for life.</p>
<p>The Pacific War broke out, and the enemy occupied the entire city of Shanghai. News from the mainland was even more impossible to find. Xu Hui struggled to support the livelihood of herself and her beloved daughter while anxiously worrying about Daojun and Li Jiecheng, who had gone to the battlefield together. At this time, Li Jiecheng was sent to Shanghai to carry out a secret mission. In one chase by enemy and puppet detectives, he accidentally encountered Xu Hui. Xu hid him in her home to heal his wounds and asked him about Daojun's whereabouts. Li Jiecheng could not answer either, as he and Daojun had also been separated for five or six years.</p>
<p>Xu Hui and her daughter continued to live in poverty. In these long and miserable months, only the friendship of A Gen and A Gen's mother, the rickshaw pullers who were infatuated with Xiaoling, and Li Jiecheng, was their only warmth!</p>
<p>Victory brought joy to people, but it also brought disaster. Many families were celebrating family reunions, but Daojun's news was still nowhere to be found. An even greater misfortune befell them: the yarn factory where Xiaoling worked to support her family told her mother that they were no longer hiring people, so Xiaoling, who was so worried about her mother, decided to take the last way out and go to her "good neighbor" Qiu Daban, relying on her singing career to survive. She returned home every night at midnight, and concealed the truth from her sick mother, saying that the yarn factory was only operating half-time.</p>
<p>After the victory, Daojun was recommended by a certain prominent person and honorably assumed the beautiful position of receiving official, changing his name to Lin Chuanxin and being sent to Shanghai. He was warmly welcomed by all parties, especially the traitor Lu Zhiming, who claimed to be an underground worker and flattered him. Daojun had also asked people to inquire about Xu Hui's whereabouts at his former residence, but he never obtained accurate information, and soon put it behind him, indulging himself in the pleasure of brothels all day long.</p>
<p>In a certain dance hall, he happened to meet the graceful and talented red dancer Aina, who was Xiaoling. Father and daughter met, and in the confusion of "seeming to know each other but not meeting", they fell in love at first sight.</p>
<p>On Christmas night, all the dance halls were open all night. Aina was reluctantly kept by Daojun. When she returned home at dawn, she ran into her mother, who had been waiting at the door for a long time. Xu Hui discovered Xiaoling's secret and severely reprimanded her, warning her that her father was a patriotic and honorable man, and that she would rather die than have her daughter engage in this occupation. From then on, Xiaoling disappeared from the dance halls.</p>
<p>Daojun did not see Aina for several days, so he asked Qiu Daban to bring a note to invite her to meet at a certain restaurant. The girl, who had been stirred by his charm, was also deeply in love with the affectionate and wealthy guest, and went to the restaurant as promised. Xu Hui saw the note left by Xiaoling and followed her. She saw the dancer in love with her daughter, who was also her husband Lin Daojun, whom she had missed day and night for eight years.</p>
<p>After this unbearable stimulation, Xu Hui's illness turned terminal and she was bedridden. Li Jiecheng arrived and happily told her that he had found out where Daojun lived. Xiaoling was overjoyed and wanted to go with Li Jiecheng to see him, but Xu Hui suddenly stopped them loudly. The two did not know why. After repeatedly asking, Xu Hui smiled bitterly and did not answer. She really did not want to tell her daughter the truth.</p>
<p>While Xiaoling was out buying medicine, Daojun came again to invite her. He happened to meet Xu Hui, who was about to die. Daojun was speechless and could not explain himself. He only told her not to spread the word, for the sake of his current reputation and status. Xu Hui was disappointed by his ingratitude and hated this incestuous disaster, so she angrily beat and drove Lin out.</p>
<p>On a stormy night, Xu Hui passed away. Xiaoling heard her mother's dying words and suddenly realized that the dancer she was infatuated with was her own father. Xiaoling was filled with shame and indignation and was so grief-stricken that she wanted to die. After Li Jiecheng's sincere persuasion, she left with Li to pursue a new life far away.</p>
<p>When Daojun, after thinking carefully, rushed to regret, the place was empty, as if light smoke had disappeared with the wind.</p>
<h3>The Story of "Returning Home in Glory"</h3>
<p>— Gu Eryi</p>
<p>In 1937, Lin Daojun, a middle school teacher in Shanghai, and his wife, Xu Hui, an elementary school teacher, and their nine-year-old daughter, Xiaoling, were living a happy, sweet, and leisurely life. Unfortunately, the "August 13th" artillery fire rang out, and the flames of aggression burned Shanghai and most of the country. Lin Daojun, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, although it was Xiaoling's birthday celebration, resolutely left his beloved wife and daughter and went with his friend Li Jiecheng to the mainland to participate in the sacred task of defending the motherland.</p>
<p>In a fit of anger, they embarked on the journey and joined the rescue work in the war zone, going in and out of the artillery fire. Daojun was used to a quiet life and could not bear the hardship. Using the excuse that the work in the front and rear was equally important, he bid farewell to his comrades-in-arms and withdrew from the front line alone, heading towards the wartime capital.</p>
<p>The difficulty of finding a job in Chongqing made Daojun, who was unfamiliar with the place, feel trapped. Finally, he was forced to go to his only old friend, Wu Boxian, whom he did not want to see.</p>
<p>Wu Boxian was the manager of Sanjiang Trading Company. Under Wu's cold demeanor, he ordered Daojun to be an automobile parts salesman. Daojun had no choice but to make a decision to go on the opposite path after repeated consideration.</p>
<p>From then on, Daojun went smoothly, rising from a salesman to a householder, and then soaring to become the general manager of Jiufeng Enterprise Company. Even Gao Liqin, the socialite who used to give Daojun the cold shoulder, was transferred to Daojun by Wu Boxian as if she were goods.</p>
<h3>"Spring Dream in Heaven"</h3>
<p>— Xu Changlin</p>
<p>Engineer Ding Jianhua was leading workers to build an airfield on the front line to cooperate with the National Army's counter-offensive. Someone rushed from a county town dozens of miles away from the airfield to Ding and others' work site, telling them the news of Japan's unconditional surrender, and showing them the news published in the newspaper. After reading it, Ding and others were overjoyed and celebrated with each other.</p>
<p>Ding rushed home to tell his wife, Shulan, who was preparing snacks for Jianhua, because she was three months pregnant and was having morning sickness. When she heard the news of the victory, the husband and wife were both unusually excited, and they planned a sweet family life after the war in the room. Ding also showed his wife the drawings of a beautifully designed house that he had completed a long time ago, as if they were already living in it.</p>
<p>Soon, Jianhua and his wife returned to Shanghai. Ding had an old mother living with a distant relative somewhere. When Jianhua first arrived in Shanghai, he also lived there temporarily. There were several manufacturers who had ingratiated themselves with the enemy by providing them with materials during the fall of Shanghai, and thus became rich. After the victory, because they had not been noticed, they were able to get away with it and used their money to make friends widely. Seeing that Ding Jianhua came from the rear, they were very friendly at first, but gradually saw that Ding had no connections and had already made friends with powerful people, and wanted to use his house to entertain distinguished guests, so they forced Ding and others to move out. Ding went everywhere to find a house, but because the transfer fees were huge and he had no gold bars, he had no place to live for a long time. Ding thought to himself that he had spent his whole life building huge mansions that stood towering before his eyes, but he had nowhere to shelter from the wind and rain, and he was living in a small room under the eaves of an ancestral hall, and he was extremely sad.</p>
<p>Shulan was about to give birth, and Jianhua had been running around for several weeks and was still unemployed. Moreover, his old mother was overworked and was also bedridden and seriously ill. At this point, Ding was utterly despondent and extremely grieved. He used his remaining money to get drunk and staggered home in the rain. Just then, the mansion was brightly lit with lanterns, and there was singing and dancing. The guards suspected that Ding was a thief and beat him. The matter was learned by the master, who saw the architectural drawings designed by Ding and loved their beauty very much, and wanted to hire him, because Gong Zheng was deeply in love with a socialite and planned to build a golden house to hide her.</p>
<p>Shulan gave birth to a son, but she was unable to raise him, and discussed it with Ding, planning to abandon him in an orphanage. The matter was known to Gong, who had been involved in the world of pleasure in his early years and had been too injured, so his wife and concubines had no children. He asked Ding to raise him as an adopted son, and paid Ding a certain price. Ding agreed, because the delivery fees had not yet been settled, but Gong repeatedly warned Ding and others not to leak this matter.</p>
<p>Gong's wife hated this child very much. One day, Gong's wife abused the child at will because it was not her own. Shulan's heart ached for her child, as if it were being cut with a knife, so she stood up and interfered angrily. Gong's wife then learned that this baby was Ding's own flesh and blood, and quarreled with Shulan, so she returned the baby to his neighbors.</p>
<p>Ding and his wife decided to leave Gong's house in this situation, but they had nowhere to stay, so they temporarily lived under the eaves of his mansion. Little did they know that this mansion was the very one that Ding had designed and built back then. Ding's name was left on the foundation stone. When Ding saw it, he was extremely grieved, so he sneaked into the mansion to caress his hard work, climbed the stairs to the top of the fifty-odd story mansion, and thought that he was an architect, but his family had nowhere to shelter from the wind and rain, and he was extremely depressed. Suddenly, he heard voices from the ground and looked down, and it was the doorman of the mansion scolding his wife and telling her to leave. Ding was furious, but he could not support his strength and suddenly lost his footing and fell. When the crowd went to rescue him, he was already dying. The police found the architect's certificate that had fallen from his body and realized that Ding was the past architect of the mansion. The passers-by were all extremely saddened.</p>
<h3>Random Talks About New Films</h3>
<p>— Ma Bochang</p>
<p>"Tonight and Every Night"</p>
<p>It is not the fire tree and silver flower containing Xingqiao Town that opens, but London at night under the big bombing. On the streets without lights, lovers walk home hand in hand. Where the fire rises, the home is left with ruins. There are also young men and women indulging in taverns. Warm feelings are not fully expressed, and a piece of smoke, they are all forever silent. This is a catastrophe, but only at this critical moment of life and death do people understand how much love is desired in a short life. Therefore, in the car, they are insatiable for sweet kisses. I believe that the story of "Tonight and Every Night" is more beautiful than other New Year's song and dance films, and more complete than "Cover Girl", although it does not have the dazzling tricks of "Cover Girl". Among several song and dance scenes, I especially appreciate "Lonely Crying". The color matching of clothes and the mask set are extremely harmonious, including the symbolic meaning unique to ballet. The scene of "Women Soldiers in the Same Camp" wearing sanitary shirts is full of curves. As a comparison, Jenny Bland seems to be slimmer, belonging to the "girlish type", while Rita Hayworth is plump and already a woman's body. Rita's singing and dancing are regarded by Columbia as a cash cow. Her dancing skills sometimes surpass Betty Ireland of Fox, but the sex appeal is as sweet as Betty. Lee Bowman with a small mustache is full of romance, and can be called a second Melvin Douglas. Jane Darwell is more charming than before. Her performance in "My Favorite Brunette" and "Romance on the High Seas" is naturally not as good. Marc Platt's dance is indeed a genius. Hitler's arrogance is expressed without regret. It can be combined with the Nazi salute in "Air Force" as a double masterpiece.</p>
<p>"Diamond Horseshoe"</p>
<p>A song and dance stage is built in the West, or it is the world of Ye Feng and Dai Carlo. The charm of her "The Gay Senorita" dance is still lingering. Carmen Miranda's world is an island in the Pacific. In the Lishang Salon, the lights are shining. Under the palm trees, the songs are passed on one by one. Mary Montan imitates Dong Shi, but she is not her opponent. When she arrives in the West and performs in a dance hall, the time, place, and people are all inconvenient. Wearing a black veil and singing a song alone, the lights are bright and there are people all around, without any sentimentality, enough to set off the mystery of the black veil. In the "Indian Girl" scene, Dorothy Lamour tries her dancing steps for the first time. Without the close-ups of "Tonight and Every Night", the charm is fully displayed. This dance cannot beat the oriental dance of "Desert Song". The women soldiers' dance is also inferior to "Sweet Rosie O'Grady". The chorus of "You Are My Rainbow" while boating on a quiet night is the most moving. The song "Whistling in Broad Daylight" is not good. Compared with Diana Durbin's driving and singing in "Spring Parade", the tempo is just right. Counting it all, as long as Dorothy's smile when she combs her hair is still pleasing. Dick Powell's singing is not weak, but fortunately he can change his style early. The movie "Murder, My Sweet" proves that his transformation has a bright future. Victor Moore is a confused old man, and he is suitable for singing a duet with Laurel and Hardy.</p>
<p>Director George Marshall is mediocre, even inferior to Robert Z. Leonard of "Spring Parade". First, he does not know how to use Dorothy Lamour's characteristics; second, he does not understand the graphic beauty of song and dance scenes. The camera only advances from the front angle, which is sluggish and lacks change; third, he limits the song and dance scene to the interior, missing the wild scenery of Arizona.</p>
<p>"Endless Love"</p>
<p>The ending of "Peach Blossom Pool" is a gray glass door, cold, bare, quiet and silent. The division of time, Yan Hua's figure brushed across the clouds, so slowly, through the bumps on the glass, like teardrops, the dark figure stopped, slowly turned around, still so quiet, so bleak, after a while this figure brushed across the clouds again and disappeared. This scene coincides with the glass door lens of "Waterloo Bridge", but "Peach Blossom Pool" is more pure and heavy, and director He Zhaozhang can be proud of this. The brief and powerful final section of high heels going upstairs in "Endless Love" uses the music of "Madame Butterfly" for dubbing, which is really clever. In such a long story, the small scenes under the eaves of Shanghai during the occupation period are too vague, stained with our past dream demons, retreating together, the wind and sand of the disaster, people only need a kind of warmth, and the dust dream on the drying platform when the air raid sounds is a bit cold, but it is the sweetness in the tears. Compared with after the victory, the light is actually a tragedy. It is a pity that He Zhaozhang only has these two points to commend, the rest are scattered and redundant. There are too many shots of air defense introducing buckets, etc., which are similar to news propaganda films. The singing in no scene is natural, and the garment stars in the set are like dog eyes, which make people laugh and cry. The screenwriter has no center, and the traces of creation are obvious. Only Zhou Xuan is the best, good at warmth and charm, which is more pleasing than her singing. After watching Western films for a long time, I have less affection for domestic films, but I still praise Zhou Xuan. Shu Shi and Huang Wansu, who play blind mothers, are okay, but the faces of Bai Chen and others are not pleasing to the eye.</p>
<h3>Review of "Woman and Peace"</h3>
<p>— Ye Lianxun</p>
<p>Before I saw "Woman and Peace," I thought Mr. Li Jianwu was just a writer who could write romantic works like "Isn't It Still Spring" and "Jin Xiaoyu." After I finished reading "Woman and Peace," I felt that Mr. Li Jianwu was not just a mediocre playwright who could only write "hero and beauty" stories, but also a progressive writer who could stand at the forefront of the times, criticize reality, and expose the evils of society.</p>
<p>Chen Baichen's "Lu Guantu" reflects the shadows of political corruption and the self-serving attitude of corrupt officials, but in Mr. Li Jianwu's "Woman and Peace," we see the cruelty of war treating humans as cannon fodder, the tragedy of families being torn apart, the exorbitant taxes and levies under political corruption and economic collapse, and the irrational phenomenon of women being surplus and men being scarce.</p>
<p>"Woman and Peace" has a story that is a myth, but not a beautiful fairy tale. It doesn't intoxicate people in pink fantasies like "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." It is a myth full of vigilance and criticism. This myth makes us think of the horror of war, the boredom of human self-slaughter, the preciousness of peace, and the pitiable and ridiculous "comedy" of harming one's fellow humans, which should be corrected.</p>
<p>Some people say that works like "Woman and Peace" are just works that show off during the low tide of the drama movement. It is not as serious and humane as Chen Baichen's "Wedding March." However, I believe that as long as a playwright denies the corrupt phenomena in society, he can use any means and form to express his themes and plots, because drama is not simply about having a complete form, but mainly about whether the content of the work has a corrective effect on real life. Therefore, although the characters in a work like "Woman and Peace" are not as realistic as the protagonists in "Wedding March" and still carry some mythological colors and the shortcoming of "exaggeration," as long as its content has achieved the task of drama correcting life, we should still say that it is a good play.</p>
<p>Chen Baichen's "Wedding March" only raises a serious question, but he does not solve the problem, while the author of "Woman and Peace," although he also shouts the slogan of striving for peace, he uses the reaction of men to defeat the war god who is addicted to killing. Obviously, the former is just a drama that raises questions, while the latter is a long-established "helmsman." It is undoubtedly "icing on the cake" to have him direct "Woman and Peace," with the balanced positioning and adept techniques. This is definitely not something an ordinary and vulgar director can achieve, especially the grand scene at the end of the third act. It is really not easy to handle this performance in such an orderly manner.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning the dance and singing, the former's simple and appropriate "drama" movements, and the latter's lyrics that use folk tunes, which bring a lot of intimacy to the audience.</p>
<p>The set design of this play is also quite satisfactory. The set design of the first act uses broken walls to show the destruction of houses after the war. The set design of "Guiren Pass" in the second act uses cartoon techniques to indicate that this is the underworld, and the set design of the last act adds the "shallow scene of the house" constantly rising to show that peace is constantly being built, and the prosperity of the past has been restored. This is quite a set design that matches the "development of the plot."</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Shen Yang's shoemaker is the most successful, with rich rhythm in his lines and a good ability to capture comedic effects. He is really a rare comedic actor. Secondly, Chen Qing's strongman and the chairman of the village also have good achievements.</p>

<h3>What If a Plane Crashes at Sea?</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Since the four plane crashes of China and Central Airlines, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of passengers, followed by the crash of the Far Eastern Airlines' Luzon Miss, it was fortunate that the Far Eastern Airlines' plane had sea rescue equipment, so only a very small number of passengers died. Since there are so many plane crashes, in wartime, people would definitely be suspicious and say that there were spies sabotaging. Indeed, if someone puts a pinch of sand or sugar in the transmission part of the engine, wouldn't there be a breakdown halfway? Now it doesn't seem that there are spies sabotaging it, so it is either attributed to the poor skills of the pilots, or it is blamed on the bad weather. In short, if the pilots die in a crash, there will be no evidence to prove anything. Weather is also a difficult thing for laymen to understand. Even a wise prosecutor like Bao Xiaosu would not be able to catch the god of weather and interrogate him.</p>
<p>Passengers inevitably become suspicious of planes and have a tiger-talking-about-color attitude. In fact, air transport is very safe if it is properly managed. Taking the Luzon Miss crash at sea as an example, because it was handled properly, the sacrifice was minimal. If it had been another airline, wouldn't all the passengers have been unjustly drowned at the bottom of the sea? We must not doubt the safety of all airlines and all planes because one or two airlines are not properly managed, and therefore give up the right to fly. However, before getting on a plane, we must understand the emergency steps in the event of an accident. Passengers on foreign planes that fly over the sea have a life jacket. When using it, pull out the bolt, and the compressed gas will fill the life jacket. It can't sink in the sea. There are two rubber lifeboats in the overhead compartment of the plane, with oars, radio transmitters, shotguns, fishing hooks, and sufficient supplies of food and medicine. When the plane malfunctions, the pilot issues a notice or alarm to abandon the plane. Passengers must not panic or move around. They must wait until the plane makes a forced landing on the sea. It will probably not sink within one or two minutes. That one or two minutes is enough for all passengers to escape to the wings. The sea is very cold, so people who fly over the sea must wear more cotton clothes. It's great if they are waterproof. The people who reach the wings first will pull out the lifeboats and pull out the bolts. The compressed gas will fill the rubber boats. At that time, the plane will be gradually sinking. The passengers who come out later may jump into the sea and grab the ropes next to the lifeboats. Sometimes the lifeboats are released upside down in a hurry, with the bottom facing up. Then everyone has to find a way to turn it over. The method is for the strong to press down on one side of the boat, so that the other side can be lifted up. Then it can be turned over. The days of drifting on the lifeboat are uncertain, from a few days to forty or fifty days. The prepared food is limited, and at most it can be used for a week. Moreover, it is limited to canned food and other compressed dry food, and there is a small amount of fresh water. The most unbearable things at sea are several. The first is the sunlight during the day, which burns your skin off. Although there is a small awning for use on the lifeboat, it really can't block the ruthless fire. The second thing caused by the heat is thirst. At first, there is still fresh water for drinking, but when the fresh water is used up, you have to wait for the rain from the sky, but this kind of expectation is not certain. No matter how thirsty you are, you must not drink seawater, which will make you even more thirsty. Some passengers are so thirsty that they would rather jump into the sea and drown. The third thing is hunger. The dry food is extremely limited, and even if it is used sparingly, it will not last for a few days. After that, you have to fish to eat. Sea fish can be eaten raw, according to my flight instructor. He drifted at sea for forty-two days and lived entirely on raw fish. Ordinary people can't live that long at sea. People with bad bodies will die after being soaked in the water for one or two days.</p>
<p>Rather Abandon Treasures, Don't Forget the Radio</p>
<p>When escaping from the plane, don't forget the radio transmitter. Rather lose gold and silver treasures, but be sure to bring the radio transmitter to the rubber boat. The transmitter is a square generator. By shaking a handle, you can generate electricity. Turn the dial to SOS to automatically send out a distress signal. If other planes pass by, shake a small mirror towards the sun to attract the attention of the people on the plane. This method is very effective. In the past, people who made a forced landing in the jungles of Burma were rescued by transmitting signals with a small mirror.</p>
<p>In wartime, the United Kingdom and the United States had rescue teams on the sea, using electric boats, planes, and helicopters to carry out rescue work. Generally, within a few hours of receiving the distress signal, they could send boats and planes to reach the scene of the accident to search for the drifting people. The most ideal rescue tool is a helicopter. It flies close to the sea and hooks the drifting people one by one, which is both easy and fast. China has also bought helicopters, but they have not been used for sea rescue. Machines are to be used by people. No matter how good the machine is, if it is not used properly, it is no different from waste. I don't have too much hope that the civil aviation authorities will have the determination to improve, but I have to enrich my rescue knowledge to seek self-defense.</p>
<h3>Must Insure</h3>
<p>— Wen Chi</p>
<p>A few days ago, there were too many accidents in the China and Central Airlines. If all passengers had travel insurance, the insurance company would have to pay a lot of money. I think this kind of insurance business is indeed quite suitable to be promoted. However, I have to declare that I am not soliciting business for any insurance company; some people think that "the dead are dead," what is the point of paying money? This certainly depends on each person's situation. The dead are indeed dead, but some of the dead still have family members who are not dead. The airline also presses down the value of Chinese lives lower than that of foreigners. In my opinion, a protest should be raised. The dead are indeed dead, but we are still Chinese! What? Still everywhere?</p>
<p>However, the airline can still bear a responsibility, compared to other places, it is still a step ahead.</p>
<p>In China's transportation industry, from planes to accidents. For example, a few days ago, there was a big car accident at an intersection. The family members of the dead are still suing Lu Futing, the former director of the Road Bureau; as for car accidents, they are commonplace in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War. Total annihilation or safe arrival is all up to fate; in terms of steamers, there are also tragic news reports of small inland steamers exploding cylinders appearing in the newspapers, and most of the accidents do not bear any responsibility. All of this makes people think that Chinese people's travel is really too unsecured, making people shudder with fear.</p>
<p>I think that on the one hand, we should ask the government to strictly order all state-owned institutions or private enterprises that control transportation tools to effectively assume responsibility for travel safety, and also specify a reasonable compensation method. If an enterprise only makes money and lightly unloads its compensation responsibility, then it is really too "getting what it deserves." On the other hand, I think that all travelers, if they think it is necessary, should still get insurance. As for business trips on public service, public and private institutions may have a pension after the accident, but often the amount is enough to make people laugh or cry. I think it is better to allocate a small amount of special funds in advance to pay insurance premiums for business travelers. Pensions, insurance, and compensation are all responsible. But now we only see the airline paying a sour one million yuan in some kind of fee to the family members of the dead, which is really infinitely touching: How unfortunate to be born a Chinese!</p>
<p>"Buy Meat with Extra Pig Feet"</p>
<p>A few days ago, I took a trip on the Suxi-Changzhou Road on the Shanghai-Nanjing Highway and encountered an unexpected thing. The ticket price for the Suxi-Changzhou bus is 3,600 yuan, but when buying a ticket, you must pay 3,800 yuan before the ticket seller is willing to stick a ticket out of the window. This additional 200 yuan is to buy a "travel accident insurance policy" from some company. As the saying goes: "Buy meat with extra pig feet," meaning that if you buy a little more meat, with agreement, you can get some pig feet without paying extra. It is an old example. But buying a bus ticket with an insurance policy is still the first time I've seen it. But they insist on you paying for fire insurance, military insurance, life insurance, travel insurance, and all kinds of tricks, which are the various business departments of an insurance company. The insurer receives a small amount of premium, and if an accident occurs, it has to pay a large amount of compensation, which is originally considered a fair transaction, with no deception. You can choose to insure if you want, and you can't force it on the street if you don't want to.</p>
<p>But the bundling method on the Suxi-Changzhou Road is simply forced. You have to insure even if you don't want to, otherwise they won't sell you a ticket and won't let you go. Therefore, taking this road means "must insure."</p>
<p>To be honest, the Suxi-Changzhou Road is only 60 Chinese miles long, and the roads are good. I don't know if there will be an accident, or if passengers will be "dead or disabled" after running ten thousand trips. So if passengers don't insure, it's fine, but if they do, they are "sure to win" and make money. Of course, everyone is willing to do things that "sure to win" and make money, but there is a big problem with this "must insure" method. I think the insurance business still needs to be promoted by all parties in China. This is really a quite meaningful business. "Must insure" is not allowed. You want to "sure to win," but the customers don't eat it, and neither does human emotion or law. "Must insure" becomes "forced to insure," "forced," "sure to win." Starting with small things and focusing on big things, the promoters of China's insurance business should use their brains more and calculate "sure to win" less, so that people will automatically and certainly insure. This is the attitude that business operators should have, otherwise it will not be very sophisticated.</p>
<h3>"New Year" Is Hard to Get Through</h3>
<p>— Youzhen</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, when you go to visit relatives and friends, if you don't say "Happy New Year," they will shout "Congratulations" first; therefore, congratulating each other on getting rich is all the same, unbearably vulgar; although it is clear that this is a bad habit, it is limited to human "feelings" and "face," and you can't help but "reciprocate" a bit. Therefore, old customs and bad habits are unbreakable! Year after year, no one can resist.</p>
<p>Then, the servant smilingly brings out a cup of tea, with two olives attached to the side of the cup. Olives are originally a symbol of "bitterness comes before sweetness," which is considered auspicious and not annoying; however, in customs, olives are ingots, and ingots are "bringing in wealth and treasure." The master means that everyone gets rich, while the servant means attracting the wealth of the guests. At this time, even if your pockets are empty, seeing these two green fruits, you can't help but take out banknotes and reward the servant; otherwise, you always feel embarrassed!</p>
<p>Therefore, the difficult year-end has already passed, but the "New Year" of getting rich is really hard to get through! Many relatives and friends don't go to congratulate "New Year" to be scolded, saying congratulate "New Year," but can't afford the two "ingots"!</p>
<h3>Two-Headed Monster Baby – One Side Laughs, One Side Cries</h3>
<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, there are really many tricks in Shanghai. As long as you innovate and advertise in a unique way, you will cause a sensation for Shanghainese to watch. On the third floor of the New World on Nanjing Road, there is an exhibition of two-headed monster babies, and quite a few people come to see them. The baby has two heads, one head is scolding, one head is sleeping sweetly, one head is chewing, one head is staring blankly, one head is laughing, and one head is crying. They say in the advertisement that it is not for fun, but has research value. What is the reason for this kind of abnormality? I am not a physiologist, so of course I can't study the reason.</p>
<p>However, how many things happen in this deformed and turbulent society with one side laughing and one side crying? Alas! Two-headed monster babies are everywhere, when will this abnormality stop?</p>
<h3>Quasi-New Prophecy</h3>
<p>— Shigu</p>
<p>The 1947 prophecy said that the people had already seen the rain pass, and the year of Bingxu cannot be without prophecy. I intend to write eight new prophecies.

Therefore, I humbly add the word "Quasi," intending to respect other prophetic predecessors.</p>

Those that have not been overprinted can also be used at the same value. The citizens celebrate, and some set off firecrackers. However, one yuan notes are extremely scarce on the market, so the result is still quite disappointing.</p>

<h3>A Day in the Life of Attlee</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>If you happen to be in St. James's Park in London early in the morning, you may see an elderly couple walking slowly. If you catch up and take a closer look, it turns out to be Mr. and Mrs. Attlee. This is the morning walk that the Prime Minister and his wife take before starting their day's work.</p>
<p>The Attlees live at 10 Downing Street near the park—the official residence of the British Prime Minister. The house at 10 Downing Street is very large, but the Attlees only occupy the upper floors and use the lower floors when public affairs require it.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister gets up very early, already out of bed by 7:30 AM. He reads the morning papers (The Times, the Manchester Guardian, and the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald) at breakfast, and then goes for a walk in the park.</p>
<p>Back from the Walk After Mr. and Mrs. Attlee return from their walk, the Prime Minister returns to his office in 10 Downing Street to begin work, reviewing the telegrams and documents that require his attention. If there is no Cabinet meeting (the regular Cabinet meetings are held every Monday from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, and every Wednesday from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM), visitors arrive around 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>The visitors are always Cabinet members, Members of Parliament, members of committees chaired by the Prime Minister, and guests who come to pay their respects. The conversations continue until lunchtime, which is usually at 1:00 PM. The Attlees often have lunch with Labour Party leaders or visiting dignitaries.</p>
<p>Every day around 1:45 PM, the Prime Minister goes to the House of Commons to answer questions. He may stay to participate in debates, where he must speak, and until the House adjourns (sometimes as late as 10:30 PM).</p>
<p>While in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister meets with many Members of Parliament, where he gets a sense of the Parliament's view on current issues. His Parliamentary Private Secretary and press officers supply him with public opinion.</p>
<p>Handling Official Documents Returning to his office in 10 Downing Street, Attlee handles official documents, telegrams, and reports! He stops working at 4:00 PM to have tea with his wife and daughter. At 5:00 PM, he begins work again, receiving visitors, holding committee meetings, signing documents, and dictating letters, until 7:00 PM, when he has dinner.</p>
<p>Dinner is often an official banquet, with famous visitors and others in attendance. Dinner, coffee, cigars, and conversation usually take two hours. Then Attlee goes back to work for about an hour.</p>
<p>Like most Britons, the Prime Minister is also a cricket fan. Between all these meetings and work, he studies the results of the day's cricket matches.</p>
<p>Valuing the Younger Generation Among the visitors at 10 Downing Street, there are often young Labour MPs who have shown great promise in their work in Parliament. Attlee often reads the Parliamentary record and pays close attention to young MPs whose speeches show that they have the talent and ideas that are beneficial to the Labour Party and Britain. This is one way the Prime Minister identifies talented people who are qualified to become Cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister is at home, his favorite pastime is detective novels, but he also enjoys classical poetry, and he also carries a notebook to write down his own verses. Although he doesn't object, he doesn't like modern poetry.</p>
<p>Since becoming Prime Minister, Attlee has had to give up his hobby of woodworking because of lack of time.</p>

<h3>Yunlin New Year's Day Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Kailing, the owner of the Yunlin Painting and Calligraphy Society (No. 40, Lüban Road), held a "New Year's Day Paintings" and calligraphy exhibition from January 21st (the first day of the lunar Dinghai year) to the 30th at the society. The author visited on the second day of the lunar new year to offer New Year greetings and participate in the congee gathering, returning satisfied with both spiritual and material nourishment.</p>
<p>"New Year's Day Paintings" is an old theme, truly countless. If you want to hold an exhibition with "New Year's Day Paintings" as the theme, there are only two paths to follow: (1) Emphasize "quantity," giving people a sense of clutter and overwhelming the senses; (2) Emphasize "quality," having its own artistic value beyond mere timeliness. Mr. Yang Kailing adopted the second approach this time, which is commendable.</p>
<p>All of the "New Year's Day Paintings" in the exhibition have prefaces by Mr. Wu Zhihui. The main purpose of "New Year's Day Paintings" is to offer blessings: fortune, prosperity, and longevity. Mr. Wu Zhihui lacks none of these! At the advanced age of eighty-three, with profound knowledge and a reputation respected both at home and abroad, a gentleman who receives "New Year's Day Paintings" need only be somewhat like Mr. Wu Zhihui, I think, to feel proud! Moreover, the people who collaborated with Mr. Wu are all famous painters, such as Zhang Daqian, Wang Yachen, Ma Chaoran, Jiang Hanting, Mei Lanfang, Zhang Junmou, Zheng Wuchang, Wu Hufan, Chen Dingshan, Hou Xiang, Qin Qingzeng, Zhu Jianqiu, He Tianjian, Xu Yuliu, Qin Guliu, Xian Kunbo, Hou Biyi, and Tang Xiangleng. With all kinds of beauty gathered together, the two difficulties (painting and calligraphy) combined, it is truly a magnificent sight!</p>
<p>The calligraphy section is also strong. Mr. Wu Zhihui, Ye Gongchuo, Shen Yinmo, Pan Boying, Zhang Ji, Chen Qicai, Zhang Mojun, Zou Lu, Niu Yongjian, Dan Maoxin, Hua Shixun, Hou Xiang, Hu Yisheng, and Yang Qianli are all outstanding masters. The characters are sometimes thin and sometimes plump, sometimes rigid and sometimes gentle; some people are known for their calligraphy, and some calligraphy is known for its author; some, being scholars, retain their scholarly essence; and others, having galloped across battlefields, retire after achieving merit and follow elegant pursuits. As the ancients said: establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words: all the participants in the calligraphy exhibition have established something. We, the viewers, in addition to admiring their calligraphy, also hold unlimited respect for their character and achievements.</p>
<p>Now, I randomly publish a "New Year's Day Painting" to show a glimpse. The painting is by: Zhang Junmou painting plum blossoms, Chen Dingshan painting bamboo, Zheng Wuchang painting pine trees, Jiang Hanting painting nandina, Zhang Daqian painting lingzhi, Mei Lanfang painting water chestnuts, Wang Yachen painting persimmons, Feng Chaoran painting cypress branches, and Wu Zhihui writing the preface.</p>
<p>January 24, Year 36, the third day of the lunar Dinghai year, first attempt at writing.</p>

<h3>The Truthfulness of Modern Painting</h3>
<p>— Guan Liang</p>
<p>Since Cézanne expressed three-dimensionality in modern painting, it is more accurate to say that the painters of that time, rather than striving for novelty and seeking various themes and diverse expressions, were struggling with the superficial traditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and seeking transcendence, even creating a more lively and free form of self-expression. At that time, from Cézanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Picasso, to Chirico and Salvador, they were attacked by stubborn conservative critics, who believed that in abandoning the traditional concept of beauty, they were merely engaging in the destructive nonsense of the Dadaists, without building anything. However, the fact is that art is creation, not just the pursuit of ancestral traditions for satisfaction. Looking back from today, more than twenty years later, their intense construction of new art was not in vain but left behind more brilliant and beautiful flowers in the entire history of modern painting.</p>
<p>Some people believe that new art is always difficult to understand; because it is difficult to understand, it is only met with indifference, and even slander follows. Since new painting negated the superficial traditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, its most valuable aspects are its spirit and new truthfulness. The Fauvist painter Vlaminck, in his still lifes and landscapes, not only expresses the subject's color and quality vividly but even uses salt and sugar as metaphors. Even though they are both piles of white things, he should express that one represents saltiness and the other represents sweetness. From this, it can be seen the seriousness of the Fauvist painters at that time towards truthfulness. The truthfulness of modern painting is not just one-sided but should be multi-faceted. For example, "visual truthfulness," "emotional truthfulness," and metaphysical truthfulness can all be good examples. In terms of visual truthfulness, painters not only express a subject to satisfy the "likeness" but also find factors more important than likeness in the "likeness," which is to say that, for example, the human body should be a flesh-and-blood entity, and beyond expressing the flesh-and-blood entity, what is more important is life. How to make that life appear more actively on the canvas, and at the same time, it should be attached with indispensable emotions. When emotions dominate the canvas, even the superficial form can be abandoned, and even more abundant images can be obtained in deformation. Matisse, Derain, Gauguin, and Vlaminck can be representative of this type of work. As for emotional truthfulness, beyond pursuing color harmony and shape transformation, painters express a true feeling of the emotions at that time. This is similar to the feeling of floating like an immortal when first experiencing a kiss in the life of first love, directly depicting this feeling onto the canvas, and receiving an effect that transcends visual truthfulness. Writers such as Chirico can be representative of this example.</p>
<p>In metaphysical truthfulness, the group of surrealist writers who were once called monsters in the art world can be representative. Surrealists believe that beyond the thinking in daily life, there is still a life of fantasy and dreams dominating life in unknowable times, and they directly depict their own fantasies or dreams onto the canvas. They believe that if painting can express daily visible life, then how can it not depict daily invisible but more valuable parts of reality? Since the discovery of surrealism, new painting has not only been like flowers that the common folk have never seen, but it has also expanded the field of new painting from the limited to the unlimited, bringing modern painting into infinite angles and visions. The most recent surrealists have expanded from purely poetic themes to political and social themes. They believe that in addition to using words and writing to convey thoughts, people's illusions and dreams at least have common points of resonance and common truthfulness. Taking these as themes may not be incomprehensible things. Painters of this type are Salvador, who currently lives in the United States, and Miró can be representatives.</p>
<p>In short, from Cézanne to Picasso and Dalí, modern painting has not only expanded the fields that predecessors could not have dreamed of in just two short decades, but also created broader aesthetic views from various schools since the negation of traditional beauty. Painting is not just the reproduction of the subject matter, but the creation of the subject matter.</p>
<h3>An Autobiography of a Philippine Writer</h3>
<p>— Written by Bulusan, translated by Peng Siyan</p>
<p>Since my autobiography was published, I have received many letters asking the question "How did I become a writer?" They want to know how a person without formal training can write pleasant and stimulating works. They also want to know all the factors that contributed to my writing career.</p>
<p>It is difficult to answer these questions, because a writer's success requires a long process and delicate tempering. When I came to America, I never thought I would become a writer. I recall the day I set off for America from my hometown, with only a vague impression of America in my mind. How could I have imagined being so fortunate in America? At the same time, I was not clear about the exact reason for my pursuit of knowledge. However, deep in my subconscious, there was indeed a passion to resist the harsh environment that pressed on my childhood. It was for this reason that I resolutely left my motherland.</p>
<p>But where did this "resistance" come with me? Of course, I don't think this resistance was born within myself. I often found many faults in my friends. Therefore, I began to feel that I had moved from a lower standard to a situation that contradicted the American conscience. Moreover, the only way I could avoid anger in my distress was to "run." So for the past ten years, I have been living a wandering and fearful life. From Zhuhe to temporary stability, the result was that I fell into the abyss of fear instead of escaping it. This almost made me want to give up on life. This feeling of fear did not stop until I realized that "resistance" was born within myself. In fact, fear is part of my consciousness, and at that time I began to seek ways to get rid of fear.</p>
<p>First, we must understand the nature of fear, what brings fear, and what makes fear so terrible. Is it because I was driven to Alaska and forced to do animal-like work in a poor working environment that a terrible shadow appeared in my mind? Or is it because when I arrived in California, I was refused entry into the church and saw "soul traders" dominating religious beliefs, which caused fear?</p>
<p>In fact, the times I have felt the most fear in my life are still the following: The first time, at a bus station in San Francisco, I was completely attracted by a beautiful American woman. At that time, I did not expect that a white man would give me an embarrassing blow. Afterwards, I was very ashamed of why I couldn't refute him in the following tone: Is human beauty a special product of Americans? This feeling of guilt really made me unable to forget it for a while; on the contrary, it aroused my courage to praise. At the same time, I have always believed that beauty belongs to everyone, not to a certain race or a certain class. Therefore, I was completely freed from the long-standing fear. Secondly, one day when I went to the public library to study on my own, people on the street pointed at me and laughed. At first, I didn't think they were laughing at me. When I looked in the mirror and saw myself all over, I realized that they were laughing at the hole in the crotch of my pants. At that time, I felt very sad. In fact, I had been going to the library to read books at that time every day for six months, and the clothes I wore were all this set. Because I was completely focused on the beautiful words and deeds in the books of California, I forgot that there were also clothing requirements among human beings. That evening, I sneaked into the gambling den to drink "oily tea."</p>
<p>Indeed, I was lonely during those years of fear, shame, and hunger; I hardly had contact with human beings (even with a single individual) for several years, and I had not heard a woman's delicate voice. One late night, I woke up from a dream and stroked my face with the cold blanket. At that time, I really yearned for human affection. Several years later, I did meet a woman who indeed brought me to the edge of the real world, and also made me encounter the fear of American racial discrimination. Because her father said to me in a cold tone: "You Filipinos are not human at all, and you are not worthy of talking about love with my daughter."</p>
<p>Is "love" a unique property of white people? Does "love" belong to race? Why did the American father make such a mistake? Alas! Clear water is actually more compassionate than the love between men and women, pigeons are actually more faithful than the love between human beings, and the construction of ants in their society is actually more perfect than the world of my private ownership!</p>
<p>By depriving me of my right to be human, I began to live like a silent bird in the forest. In fact, in the declining "social forest," there are even more vicious beasts. Therefore, I can't bear to see such a human life again. I once thought: If I could truly become a silent bird and not be restricted by so-called "humanity," that would be the best thing.</p>
<p>But someone helped me run out of the darkness and move towards the light, so I can write about the truth of our life in the forest. The motivation for this writing is entirely to expose the sins of Filipinos living in America. In fact, it is also to expose the sins of millions of people living in the "social forest." Then I hope that in this exposed text, I can develop a</p>
<p>I am very clear about the situation in the United States, and I am also quite familiar with the source of American democracy, so I am deeply afraid that the future of American democracy will be ruined by money, power, and influence. Therefore, I hope that the United States will have a writer who can do his best to contribute his experience to serve thousands of Americans, and I also hope that the Philippines will have a writer who can create weapons of life and hope for the people. Only such a writer has meaning and function.</p>
<p>The above is my answer to the question of how I became a writer that people generally ask. Originally, a writer is not only for life, but also to understand the essence of American democracy, and at the same time to promote it to build a society in which there will be no more racial discrimination and contempt for the poor and lowly. Then our goal of liberating mankind will be achieved. (Translated from The Far East</p>

<h3>Aesthetic Education and Psychological Construction</h3>
<p>— Zheng Wuchang</p>
<p>Remembering Teacher Cai Yuanpei, who advocated aesthetic education</p>
<p>The recognition of beauty comes from the inherent intuition of human beings; because of the level of knowledge, different perceptions arise; often you think it is beautiful, but I think it is not beautiful; today I think it is beautiful, tomorrow I think it is not beautiful; here I think it is beautiful, but elsewhere I think it is not beautiful. It seems to be very complicated and without standards. Therefore, what is truly beauty? First, there must be a law, which is the "law of beauty." In my humble opinion, "beauty" must conform to "truth" and "reality," that is, it must be "true," which is one law. Once it is true, it must also cater to the appreciation of the ears and eyes, making you feel happy and joyful, which is "good," which is one law. With these two laws, whether in production or in actions, they are all beautiful - fine art, virtue. On the contrary, things that are unreasonable, irrational, hurt conscience, and harm morality are all not beautiful. The ancients said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself;" "Do not deprive others of what they like." Human beings inherently have a little bit of conscience and ability, and no one knows what beauty is, and no one knows how lovable beauty is. Not imposing on others what you do not want, and not insulting what others like, is conforming to reason, which is "true"; therefore, harmony between self and others is a "good"; is it not a virtue? Exhaustively imitating creation and learning from nature is fine art, but painting distant trees larger than nearby trees, and unfurling sails in the wind and rain, is unreasonable, which is not "true"; it makes people see it unpleasantly, which is not "good"; can it be considered fine art? From this, it is not difficult to have a considerable standard for so-called aesthetic education. In fact, the work and effect of aesthetic education are very common and long-standing in human society, firmly holding supreme authority. For example, men's clothes and hats, women's rouge and jewelry, officials' palaces and instruments, merchants' storefronts and advertisements, religious buildings and images, from making rituals and music to seeking flowers and willows, all borrow the influence and temptation of beauty to cater to human's love of beauty to achieve their desired purposes; it can also be said that all politicians, religious leaders, educators, and other sociologists must use "fine art" and "virtue" to govern the country, preach, and change customs.</p>
<p>Now, wise men who care about national affairs are all talking about building a new China. They mean that because our China, which has a history of thousands of years of culture, has now collapsed and fallen behind, it must be rebuilt. I don't know whether what is to be built is to be built the same as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, which is considered new? Or to be a little newer than them, which is considered new? I think whether it is new or old, as long as it is "beautiful." Psychological construction is much more important than material construction; propriety, righteousness, integrity, shame, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love are our old Chinese virtues, and they can also be said to be eternally new, but now they are really declining! We should awaken them from the psychology of the people. If the psychology of the people has the construction of virtue, all politics, education, military affairs... can be reasonable and conform to the situation, and get on the right track; as for industry, commerce, etc., it is not difficult to have constructions that adapt to the actual situation of modern times. If it is easy to be polluted, easy to fight, and easy to corrupt, which goes against the laws of beauty, there is no hope for construction. Therefore, I now miss even more the promotion of</p>
<p>Teacher Cai Yuanpei once advocated "replacing religion with aesthetic education." At that time, quite a few people shouted together; now, hardly anyone talks about it. This great and lofty enlightenment, especially in modern Chinese society, only acknowledges it as a famous saying, and does not try to carry it forward and make it a reality. It not only fails to live up to Guangjue, but also blows out the bright lamp of the national cultural movement.</p>
<p>The existence of any religion is nothing more than holding a common emotion, reason, and nature of human beings as a basis, compiling doctrines and classics, and spreading influence to prevent the loss of the original emotion, reason, and nature, so as to become a Buddha, attain the Tao, escape sin, and ascend to heaven. But among them, it is inevitable to borrow divine sayings and ghost stories, and use confusing means. As for aesthetic education, there is only one "beauty" character to serve as the creed of education, which is relatively bright and practical. Because human beings, whether foolish or wise, can be said to love beauty. Loving beauty is human nature, and we hold this love of beauty; on the one hand, we come to develop the spirit of beauty, improve the degree of beauty, increase the value of beauty, promote the effectiveness of beauty, and at the same time cultivate the appreciation of beauty, arouse the love of beauty, and understand the function of beauty. A group of people who have a love of beauty are constantly nourished and influenced by beauty, and then reform their body and mind, change their temperament, and even change customs, which is probably more natural and easier to believe than the practice of doctrines by believers who have been baptized or ordained.</p>
<p>However, "beauty" has "laws" of beauty. It is not beautiful just to be good-looking and pleasing to the eye; it is not beautiful just to be lovable and attractive; it is not beautiful just to be self-satisfied and envied by others. People in the world are busy, seeking wealth and profit, and fighting for power, which one is not to seek the comfort and enjoyment of beauty to satisfy his desire for the love of beauty. But the result is that it is not beautiful. This is all because they do not know the "laws of beauty" and blindly pursue them, so that they draw tigers like dogs and learn Taoism and become demons, and even like moths throwing themselves into the flames, they do not realize it until they die. How much this fails to live up to the good intentions of Heaven in endowing human beings with the love of beauty! To save the people who have gone astray for the love of beauty, there must be "beauty education."</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Depiction in Western Painting History: Landscape Painting in the 16th and 17th Centuries</h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>If one were to trace the roots of the development of landscape painting in Western art history, one could find considerable material even in the Classical era, taking its subject matter from the narrative poem "The Odyssey" or from fantastical landscape paintings. In the Roman era, one can find interior decorations in Pompeian houses that "resemble Japanese fusuma paintings (Note: Fusuma are similar to shoji screens, but are covered with special thick paper and painted with various pictures, serving as interior decorations)." Until the 15th century of Christian painting, Italian paintings often featured works with landscape painting concepts in the background, as the prevalence of perspective at that time made the trend of depicting landscapes as backgrounds even more popular. However, purely drawn-from-life landscape paintings began to appear, and landscape paintings began to be produced as independent works. Representative works from the 16th century include the beautiful murals by the Venetian painter Giorgione and the watercolors by the German painter Dürer. The sketches of Leonardo da Vinci should also be especially noted. Among Leonardo's sketches, there are groups that resemble landscape sketches from life. However, most of them are memoranda regarding the investigation of natural phenomena, rather than pure landscape sketches from life; for example, the landscape of mountains under rain is a sketch depicting meteorological phenomena, and the sketch depicting the river basin is a sketch of fluvial phenomena, all of which are records of observations and studies of geophysics. Therefore, Leonardo's concrete study of vivid natural phenomena with a purely scientific attitude is integrated with the purely artistic observation of exploring the aesthetic of scenery with scientific sensitivity, forming an inseparable unity. Thus, the works that resemble landscape paintings that can be found in his sketches are a form of integration of "science" and "art," which is completely different from pure landscape painting, but at the very least, it can be considered a landscape sketch. This sketch is dated 1473, and scholars who study the history of landscape painting attach great importance to this clearly dated material.</p>
<p>Almost at the same time as Leonardo, Dürer, who completed German painting, also left a pair of excellent watercolor landscape paintings. These landscape paintings beautifully depict the local color of Germany at that time, which is a very evocative work. In addition to natural scenery, many depictions of folk houses are also included.</p>
<p>Giorgione's outstanding landscape painting, commonly known as "The Tempest," is a purely colorful landscape painting. The clouds in the sky behind are thick and dark, while the colors of the trees are rich and bright. It is said to depict the local color of Castelfranco, where the author lived. According to some researchers, the figures in the foreground of the painting are related to legends, but it is more appropriate to regard these young and poor men and women as decorative figures. And this latter interpretation is of great significance in art history. Because pure landscape paintings with decorative figures appeared as a "work" from this point on. Giorgione also has a painting called "Pastoral Concert," which focuses on depicting figures and cannot be regarded as a landscape painting, but Giorgione's excellent talent for depicting landscapes is fully demonstrated here.</p>
<p>Combining the above-mentioned various works, they are merely beautiful historical materials that are scattered individually. Landscape painting became an independent department in painting and promoted systematic development in the next era (i.e., after the 17th century).</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>In the 17th-century art world, there were two systems of landscape painting: (1) "ideal landscape painting" and (2) "pastoral landscape painting." The former developed in France, while the latter flourished in the Netherlands. Generally speaking, the former is a system that arose based on the needs of court culture, while the latter is a form that matured in the atmosphere of civic culture. However, there are still many points to be noted when examining it from the perspective of realism.</p>
<p>At that time in France, ideal landscape painting was respected in principle, while pastoral landscape painting was not recognized for its high artistic value. Although the reasons are complex, the main points are as follows: At that time, France inherited the mythological legends of the Classical era, and combined with the Italian tradition of landscape depiction, it preferred the Italian flavor of foreign sentiment to natural scenery. Therefore, the artistic natural trend must be expressed in idealized techniques. At that time, the gardens sought by society in France and Italy were not natural imitations, but distinctly formalized gardens. For example, the vast gardens of "Versailles" can be regarded as its representative. At that time, kings, nobles, and aristocrats often wandered in this kind of patterned garden. Therefore, it is very possible that any artistry was not recognized in the pastoral landscape of the farmer's living environment.</p>
<p>However, there were still many realistic natural tendencies in this situation, because French painters inherently respected realism, and this characteristic was naturally expressed in their paintings; therefore, even ideal landscape paintings often contain rich realism. For example, Nicolas Poussin, the founding father of French painting, was a representative writer of ideal landscape painting at that time, but the background of his landscape paintings with decorative legendary figures was a sketch of the suburbs of Rome. Moreover, Gaspard Dughet's paintings often include pure sketches from life that do not contain any legendary figures, and even his works can be found that can truly feel the local color of the mountainous areas near Rome.</p>
<p>This kind of sketching tendency can also be clearly seen in French painting in the 18th century. For example, in the works of Antoine Watteau, a representative painter of the time, many use aristocratic gardens as backgrounds, such as "The Embarkation for Cythera," in which the trees depicted are realistic sketches. By the second half of the 18th century, for example, the works of Hubert Robert, a landscape painter representing the dawn of Neoclassicism, were mostly pure sketches depicting the ruins of classical Rome.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the ideal landscape paintings that developed in France mostly contain elements of sketching from life.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The Netherlands was a newly emerging republic that separated from Spain in the mid-17th century, and its religion was also Protestantism. Its colors were particularly strong, and its social system and customs were different from those of France, so its paintings also had their own characteristics. For example, Rembrandt's style of religious painting seems to express the world of sacred tradition in everyday language. Also, in Frans Hals's portrait paintings, one can find easily approachable everyday expressions. This basic sentiment opened up a new phenomenon of using the living environment of everyday life as the subject of painting, thus creating paintings with unique local flavors. The depiction of the living environment of everyday life significantly expanded the scope of painting. The situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The description of the living environment inside the homes of citizens is a kind of genre painting, but its nature is completely different from ordinary genre paintings. Ordinary genre paintings show a certain degree of curiosity about the materials and emphasize specific interests, but Dutch paintings are more natural and easygoing than this, like a fragment of everyday life. In order to distinguish this kind of work from ordinary genre paintings, it is more appropriate to call it "interior painting."</p>
<p>(2) Certain places where the public gathers, such as roads, squares, or the interior of public buildings, are also special themes. Art historians call this "architectural painting" and recognize its particularity.</p>
<p>(3) Still life paintings, which appeared in art history as an independent department, also began in the Netherlands at that time. This is also a close-up of the living environment of everyday life. However, ordinary still life paintings did not reach a high level of development. The completion of still life paintings should be attributed to Chardin, a great painter of the French bourgeoisie who inherited and promoted the Dutch painting style, but the history of still life paintings began in the 17th-century Netherlands.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in the 17th-century Netherlands, many specialized painters who depicted the living environment of everyday life appeared, and their works were mostly small paintings. They have a delicate and light style and are suitable for hanging in citizens' homes for appreciation. In this situation in the Netherlands, pastoral landscape painters appeared, using the countryside as the theme of depicting the living environment to meet the needs of society at that time, which was also inevitable.</p>
<p>Pastoral landscape paintings developed in the Netherlands, and their subject matter was broad and their forms varied. Generally speaking, they have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) Similar to the above-mentioned "architectural painting," it depicts regional landscapes including buildings.</p>
<p>(2) It depicts pastoral landscapes decorated with livestock and shepherds, some of which can be regarded as animal paintings.</p>
<p>(3) It depicts pastoral landscapes centered on various figures, including those that resemble genre paintings.</p>
<p>(4) It depicts seaside landscapes, many of which are centered on sailing ships.</p>
<p>(5) It depicts the natural environment mainly with trees.</p>
<p>(6) It depicts the effect of clouds in the sky.</p>
<p>(7) It combines windmills or farmers' houses to depict the fun of the countryside, some of which focus on farmhouses.</p>
<p>The various constituent elements mentioned above are arbitrarily combined to produce various changes, and the writers are generally equally excellent. In other words, the general level of pastoral landscape painters is quite high, and the number of writers is also considerable. Among these many writers, Jacob van Ruisdael is relatively well-known, but the most outstanding one is Rembrandt; this person was the only writer who painted religious paintings at that time, and his portrait paintings and genre paintings were also not bad. And he is also quite famous as a landscape painter. Rembrandt was proficient in oil painting techniques, and he used these techniques to add a complete and rich atmosphere to pastoral landscape paintings. In short, the 17th century was an era that marked out new territories in the history of painting.</p>
