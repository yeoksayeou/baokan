<p>馬歇爾提議建立德中央行政機構　强調德應爲一經濟整體　法表示反對並主張魯爾區與德分離　　〔中央社莫斯科十七日專電〕馬歇爾於本日會議中，要求視德國為一經濟整體，並提議外長會議應指令德國盟方當局，建立德國中央行政機構，由德國人士領導之。土產及進口貨應不限於佔領區界綫，而在全德國普遍基礎上使用之。全面進出口計劃應即制定，俾德國能健速價付經過批准之進口額，財政改革計劃應及早擬定，並應發行新通貨，盟國管制當局不應使佔領區界綫為政治及經濟之藩　，而僅為佔領國保安軍隊駐紥之界綫。　　〔本報訊〕莫斯科十八日廣播：四外長今日下午開會，法外長皮杜爾要求魯爾，蘇爾及萊茵各區應與德國脫離。皮杜爾對統一德境經濟，表示反對。謂此舉可使德國恢復侵略力量。　　又訊：莫洛托夫對於德境經濟統一，雖表贊同，但其意見，與英美完全背道而馳。　　〔合衆社莫斯科十八日電〕四國外次今晨十一時集會繼續討論德奧和約，外長會議將於下午四時舉行，屆時皮杜爾將不顧英美企圖自西歐排出蘇聯之慾望，而提出附議莫洛托夫之國際管制　爾計劃。法國至今尙不同意英美所提之各佔領區經濟合併計劃，而　欲英美同意法國所　之德國西部邊境案。至於德國統一案，法或亦將與蘇聯採取一致之反對。　　〔聯合社莫斯科十七日電〕外長會議今日已進入第二　，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫猛烈抨擊西方列强，並要求訂立二十年方案，由德國賠償蘇聯一百億美元，此項賠償且　自德國目前生產中　付。莫民此種要求，雖對會議最悲觀者亦感覺大出意料之外。美國務卿馬歇爾態呀鎭靜，答稱，須先使德國自給自足，然後庶可自其生產中抽取賠償。「吾人實不能接受一個統一的德國，而實際上美國人民須向另一盟國償付賠款」。莫氏責難西方列强一再違反波茨坦及雅爾達協定，亦引起馬帥嚴峻指斥。馬氏宣稱，「莫氏大部份言論之根據或邏輯，余不能同意，但無論責難　反責難，除使歧見擴大外，並不能解決吾人之問題，徒足益形糾葛」。　　今日討論時，發現蘇聯與西方三國相對陣，馬歇爾貝文與莫洛托夫所採取之堅決態呀，使觀察家難望對德問題在本屆會議中能獲任何重大結果。馬貝莫三人同意德國經濟有統一之必要，各中央機關亦應設立。但對於實施之方式則意見紛歧，對於其他各項問題則完全格格不入。馬歇爾提出取消否決權之新建議，主張柏林盟管會應以過半數表決，蘇聯迎頭反對，當然無疑。法國須在十八日之會議中，始行發表對經濟統一與賠償問題之意見。解決德國經濟問題　蘇提十二項建議　要求百億元賠償廿年付清主張國際共管魯爾工業區　　〔合衆社莫斯科十八日電〕馬歇爾·貝文及莫洛托夫對於統一德國經濟之每項細則，均不能協議，此事現已十分明顯。莫洛托夫堅持以德國現有生產事業作為賠款，亦不顧德國人民在缺乏外援之下，有無足够之生產事業。　　莫洛托夫對於德國所提出之計劃，包括如下十二點：（一）根據波茨坦協定，立即組成之中央管理機構，以討論工業，農業。財政·運輸·交通·國外貿易等問題。（二）增加錮之生產，自目前之五百八十萬噸提高至一千萬噸。（三）四國共管魯爾區。（四）改良財政制度及貨幣流通。（五）擴展出口事業。（六）在德國各「民主」政黨合作之下，解散工業托辣斯，移歸國營。（七）廢止與波茨坦協定不符之英美佔領區經濟合併。（八）賠款當根據一九三八年之世界物價而計算。（九）德國應賠償蘇聯一百億美金，蘇聯搬走之工業設備，及其使用之現有生產工具，以及外國資產皆不計在內。（十）賠款自一九四五年起，應於二十年內付淸。（十一）重組盟國間之賠償委員會。（十二）在發展和平時期德國工業之過程中不得有種種妨礙。外長代表同意　設立四委會　協助革擬德和約　　〔本報訊〕莫斯科十八日廣播：四外次今日同意設立四個常任委員會，協助草擬對德和的。開會時，英美代表力爭小國代表參加討論對德和約，但仍為蘇代表維辛斯基所阻，當時美代表墨飛與蘇代表維辛斯基曾有極激烈之辯論。　　〔路透社莫斯科十七日電〕四外長代表今晨企圖解決倫敦開會時未有協議之奧國條約中若干款，結果未有若何重大成就。關於奧軍隊人數，英國建議在美國所主張之五萬五千名與蘇聯建議之五萬名中，折中規定為五萬二千名，但以蘇代表表示尙須繼續考慮，故無協議。關於限制飛機塲一點，四代表同意採用美國之建議，規定奧國飛機塲之數額及形式，應嚴格符合奧空軍及民用航空之要。關於禁止「集體破壞力武器」一點，仍未有結論，蘇聯禁止莫國建設或恢復邊界防務之建議，則遭英美之反對。觸及問題核心展開主議鬥爭　　〔法國新聞社莫斯科十八日電〕此聞負賣人士談稱：莫斯科外長會議討論經濟問題，已達德國問題之核心。目下關鍵所在，即德國將否在經濟上保持分裂。政治的統一與經濟的統一，不可混為一談，政治統一問題在和約草成前不能解決，因其牽涉德國之永久地位問題。蘇聯切實贊成德國中央集權，英美法三國則多少贊成擴大波茨坦協定之解釋，而支持德國邦聯或德國聯邦之觀念。在和約簽訂前之過渡時期，應有何種經濟制度，乃為問題重心。經濟統一之原則，理論上一致贊同，但解釋各異，根本　　英美資本主義與蘇聯的自由主義之爭。莫洛托夫準備用間接的經濟捷徑，以達成政治的統一，並要求取消英美經濟合併，此非英美所能贊同者也。莫洛托規章宴請外賓　　〔法國新聞社莫斯科十八日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫定今午宴請出席外長會議之外國代表團代表。已有八十人接獲請東。杜魯門今返白宮　國會議員將提出三大問題　　〔本報訊〕舊金山十八日廣播：杜魯門總統短期休養已吿結束，定明日（十九日）飛返白宮，重理要公”並將接見昨由雅典抵美之美國駐希使節團領袖潘德及已由雅典起飛之美國駐希大使麥克維。杜氏休養期間，白宮隨時將莫斯科會議情形及其新外交政策聲明所引起之國際反響，由無綫電報傳達杜氏，故此次杜氏銷假視事，並不感到困難。杜氏必先考慮者，為國會之要求，即確定美國對中國及巴爾幹共產主義之政策。若干有勢力之參衆兩院議員堅持在國會批准四億美元之對希援助以前，必須有此決定。彼等對白宮提出三大問題：（一）美政府現仍壓迫蔣主席與中共言和，而對近東方面之共產黨則抱較强硬態度，其故安在？（二）在盡人皆知租借法案已經滿期之際，何以美國務院仍要求國會批准對蘇供給值價二千五百萬美元之煉油設備？（三）歐洲救濟金三億五千萬美元之一部份何以指撥與蘇聯控制下之波蘭？彼等並稱：除非美政府有明白之解合，則杜魯門擬於三月底繼承英國在希土之行動，希望甚微云。史達林接見皮杜爾　交換對德國問題意見　　〔法國新聞社莫斯科十七日電〕史達林本日在克林姆宮，接見法外長皮杜爾有所商討，蘇外長莫洛托夫及法駐蘇大使賈德魯時亦在座。　　〔法國新聞社莫斯科十八日電〕頃悉：法國外長皮杜爾今日拜訪史達林時，曾說明法國對德國問題之態度，會議歷一小時四十分鐘，在和睦空氣中舉行。其間皮杜爾追述渠於一九四四年十二月間訪問莫斯科簽訂法蘇條約情形。史帥穿軍裝，佩「蘇聯英雄章」與「社會主義工人章」。　　〔本報訊〕莫斯科十八日廣播：法外長皮杜爾昨晋謁史太林，會談兩小時之久，事後皮杜爾發表重要聲明，謂在德國邊境及德國未來政治機構未決定前，法國反對德境經濟統一計劃。美艦隊將訪希　　〔本報訊〕倫敦十八日廣播：希臘政府頃宣佈，該政府已接獲正式通知，美海軍艦隊不久將訪問拜里厄斯及克利地。按地中海東部之美海軍不時訪問希臘海口，故此舉不能視為杜魯門發表援助希土以抑制共黨勢力之聲明後，美海軍之一種示威行動。但自航空母艦「羅斯福號」訪問希臘海面以來，此次將為美海軍首次重要之訪問。劉鍇經菲赴美　　〔中央社馬尼刺十八日電〕外次劉錯本日下午五時半抵此，轉赴美國出席聯合國會議。圖示美國務卿馬歇爾於三月五日自華盛頓飛莫斯科出席四國外長會議前，在機塲上與歡送者握手話別時之情形。自左至右，國務卿馬歇爾，美新任駐英大使陶格拉斯，國務副卿艾克遜。（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）美民主黨全國委會建議兩黨聯合支持總統計劃　　〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕參議院外交委員會主席范登堡今日請民主黨協助探察杜魯門總統援助希土兩國之計劃。據稱；彼希豐民主黨少數派固人與之聯合，共同集中注意於此項援助計劃之各方面。總統提議須經國會批准議員方面則要求對於援助範圍加以若干限制，因此立法手續不免延緩。同時民主黨全國委員會曾提出一空前建議，請共和黨與民主黨聯合正式發表聲明，共同支持杜魯門計劃，援助希土兩國使成為地中海上抵抗共產主義之堅城。惟共和黨方面尙未立即發生反應。　　聯合國協會提三項建議　　〔法國新聞社紐約十八日電〕美國境內聯合國協會頃電杜魯門總統，擁護其援助希臘與土耳其計劃，但提出修正三點：（一）派遣聯合國常駐委員會前往希臘，就任何邊界擾攘事件，提出報吿；（二）制定法律，規定援助該兩國　金之一部份，應由聯合國居間應用；（三）聯合國參謀會議應迅速工作，俾美國以其援助任務移交國際警衛軍，愈早愈佳。麥帥談話反響一斑　　〔合衆社倫敦十七日電〕希臘人士頃談稱：希臘或將任命一致治要員爲駐美大使，以對杜魯門之援助建議，表示感忱。　　〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕官塲消息靈通人士今日宜稱：杜魯門總統與馬歇爾國務卿倘欲加緊進行，則美國或可於今秋準備談判對日和約。目下對日和約談判正被對德和約談判擱置。官方評論麥帥提議草擬對日和約不可再事延宕一事　私下表示美蘇或其他盟國迄無加　討論此事之任何行動。惟國務院與十一國遠東委員會從事初步工作已歷數月。國務院在接獲麥帥提議之原文前，暫不發表意見。遠東委員會則毫來贊成早日成立對日和約。　　〔聯合社東京十八日電〕此間五强外交代表今日對　　　　早日訂立對日和約一節，不願　　惟據各國代表力表示，稍後當可發表意見。中英法共四國代表，已將麥帥　議報告各本國政府，一部份觀察家相信南京，倫敦，巴黎，莫斯科方面將有正式評論發表。惟此間官方日前均不願有所表示。遠東軍法庭　不受理虛妄辨護　　〔法國新聞社東京十八日電〕國際軍事法庭今日開庭，辯護律師對中日戰爭前日本之亞洲政策有所申辯，略謂：日本之逕佔東北，僅係一種警務工作，「滿洲國」不過一傀儡國而已。日本對東北並無加以生服之討論，惟在保護東北之日僑以防土匪。庭上認為所言皆屬宣傳作用，決定不予受理。爲蘇軍干涉匈內政事　美提第二次照會　仍主美英蘇聯合進行調查　　〔聯合社布達佩斯十七日電〕美國今日向匈牙利境內蘇聯佔領軍司令史維里杜夫提出第二次照會，否認干涉匈國內政。據稱：匈牙利少數派在共黨領導之下，顯欲威脅匈國民主之繼續存在。美英蘇三國乃關於解放歐洲的雅爾達協定之事簽字者，應該採取一致行動，調查匈牙利之政治狀態。按美國第一次照會係於本月五日提出。三日後蘇方即加駁斥，謂此類調查將爲對匈國內政之魯莽的干涉，美國新照會中則否認調查爲干涉。美國務院官員談　千島列島　蘇已開始設防　　〔聯台社華盛頓十八日電〕美國務院官員今日聲稱：一九四五年雅爾達協定，訂明日本所屬千島列島，將移交蘇聯，故美國已在事前同意日本和約將規定蘇聯得保持千島列島。該列島共計四十七個島嶼，自日本本土起，向北蜿蜒至堪察加半島止。聯合國在太平洋戰勝後，蘇方即接管千島列島，顯待最後和的確認其生效。據東京傳來未證實消息，千島列島上至少有飛機塲一處已經設防，而列島所在之鄂霍次克海，已變成蘇方湖沼，自蘇軍進駐列島後，島上日本居民紛紛逃避，如薩哈林島南部日人然，薩哈林島南部亦已在雅爾達商定給予蘇聯。一九四五年二月十一日簽訂雅爾達協定時，故總統羅斯福，前首相邱吉爾與大元帥史達林曾特別申明，此等讓步，乃蘇聯於德國投降後三個月內參加對日戰爭之代價，當時蘇方更獲羅邱兩人同意，得在中國東北取得鐵路及其他權利。據雅爾達協定所載，給予蘇聯之讓步，大半係恢復一九〇四年俄日戰爭及翌年樸茨茅斯和約以前俄國所享之權利，但千島列島從未屬蘇，最初俄人曾從堪察加半島出發，侵入千島列島，一八七五年遂有條約訂立，確認日本對該列島之主權。列島全境共三千九百四十四方哩，常有濃霧，除軍事戰略觀點外，其重要性殊有限。第二次世界大戰早期，北太平洋控制　尙未決定何　時，千島列島曾一度為世人矚目。前日委治島問題　討論無結果　我支持美國立塲　　〔聯合社成功湖十七日電〕聯合國安全理事會今日討論美國代管太平洋舊日本委任統任各島間題，仍無結果。英國與澳洲代表擬在代管協定中列入一條，即讓協定非至對日和約締結之後，不能生效。美代表奧斯汀則表反對，認爲託管制度爲聯合國安全理事會之事

　　上半時，恩卡斯擲中十球，汕隊祗投入五球，形勢優劣，可以概見。恩卡斯多長人，氣力速率又與汕隊同等，兼以射籃順手，所以佔盡優勢。　　下半時二十四比十六時，紀南康罰出，林維聰扶病入替，汕隊改取攻勢，曾造廿五比廿二，三十一比廿四之接近及落後形勢，此時雙方動作粗暴，精彩全失，汕隊祇賴何立德奪籃下球，支持均勢。小林與V凱羅斯基發生誤會，同判離塲，林志仁入代，馬仔。淸江擲中，竟迫成平手，淸江罰入，汕隊反以三十二比三十一超出一分。　　此時尙餘四分鐘，局面混沌，時常三五人疊成一國，恩卡斯屢屢犯規，淸江兩罰，志仁兩投俱均中的，汕隊在最後四分鐘內反敗為勝。　　汕隊之勝，僥倖成份居多，在雙方陷入混戰時，汕隊淸江已負創不能奔跑，幸藉頭腦鎮靜，由林志仁乘間攻入兩球，最後一球係遠射，多少帶點幸運性質。（昌年）僵持中的正大學潮　　「正大」的學潮，自二月二十日學生總請假後，迄今三週，蕭校長頭部的傷勢，雖然痊癒，但是，學生護校會仍然堅持着非達到着校長辭職獲准目的後，決不復課。教育部專門委員程其保來到南昌調處，前天作了初次聽取教職員與學生對於學潮的意見與報告，他提出：從速恢復秩序的指示，學生的反映是「非達目的不復課」，所以正大學潮，現在是個僵局。　　程氏在正大教職員談話會席上轉達朱部長對學潮的三點意見，他認為正大是先天不足，後天失調，急待補養，絕對不能遭受風寒打擊。此次學生提出：「要教授，要圖書，要儀器，要工廠農塲」，均屬正當，政府當盡力設法解決，程氏並强調精神上的建設，較諸物質上的建設，尤為重要。他主張大學應如昔日書院，樹立一種風氣，影響社會國家，正大的成立，尤有特殊意義，除智識傳授外，尤應注意人格的培養，教授應注意及此，以補現行訓導制度的缺陷。　　蔣主席對正大學潮，尤表關切，程氏由京來贛時，曾奉指示「希望正大迅速恢復秩序，不願鬧至不可收拾，若眞鬧到不可收拾時，亦決不姑息。」程氏對於調處這次的學潮，認爲不太重視小處，以免多生技節。關於蕭校長被學生擊傷懲兇一點，他說：「當時近在深夜而秩序混亂，學生以石子擊傷校長，固屬不當，係屬越軌行為，但是，現在要懲兇，却是難找到眞的兇手，同時亦不能就認現在參加護校運動者或系級代表，就是龍擊校長的兇手。」他並且申述學校秩序安定，並非即拖延不理，對於此次學潮發生的原因與如何免除以後發生同樣事件，亦必根究與解決。　　蕭校長辭職問題，羅容梓教務長說：「國立大學校長被學生打傷，是開全國以及全世界各大學的先例，亦為中國大學教育之一大污點。如不嚴辦，今後亦將無人敢任正大的校長，亦無人敢任正大的教授。」　　正大的教授對於這次學潮，政治系一位教授曾勉談：「教授對學生總請假，荒廢光陰，責為可惜，校務會於上月二十二日會佈告勸導學生復課無效，所以今後恢復上課，不在教授而在學生，學生擊傷校長，此風不可長，應予處分。」胡光廷教授說：「五教授非正式召集各系級代表，苦口婆心，勸導學生復課，並由學校方面佈告，迄無答覆。」胡氏認為三個禮拜來，在此種狀態下停課，不同放假，教授亦如學生之感受苦悶，唯一希望能維持本校，使其蒸蒸日上，前途光明。　　化學系主任劉橡，是由蕭校長新聘而來，他到校僅四天，就遭遇道回不辛事件，他說：「正大的歷史淺，研究環境差，且與蕭校長尙屬新交，但是，聽說正大的研究風氣濃厚，校風良好，故應聘而來。一他對學潮的意見：「（一）學生提出的要求，有些合理，教授亦表同情。（二）學生要求的方法不對，若以「鬧風潮」，「總請假」等方式，而冀達到其目的，則教授均將裏足不來，弄成愈要愈沒有。他舉出例子：蕭校長在滬，同時聘約的教授有四人，其中二人，原欲來贛，聞發生風潮，已決定不來。（三）教育部補助各校經費，是以創辦歷史及學校成績為準，正大旣先天不足，後天失調，如三天一小潮，五日一大潮，學校是失調愈甚，風潮愈鬧得多，獲得補助的機會愈少。（四）校長縱為學生所不滿，亦不能將其打得頭破血流，而要挾教部撤換。　　學生護校會代表引述程其保氏的訓話：「正大是先天不足，後天失調」嬰孩，他們將蕭校長臂喻為一個沒乳的奶媽，以無乳之母，怎能贗此撫育嬰兒之重任，並喻程氏此次來校調處，是個學驗具優的醫生，必能洞察眞情，用科學的方法，為此嬰兒更換有乳的奶媽。　　正大一四一四位靑年學子，為了「護校」而請假，停課，雖說是為正大前途，但是，現實的損失，還是在學生，所以程其保委員對正大學潮第一張處方，是恢復秩序。截至最近，這位程「醫生」，在施行手術—執行教部的解散侖令—以前，正慎重地對「恢復秩序」方面，作最後努力。　　（本報駐贛記者劉藻三月十五日寄自南昌）從世運談到全運  王徵君　　舉世矚目的世界運動會，將於明年八月在英國倫敦舉行，因受戰爭影響而停止了將近十年的國際性的體育活動，將要恢復戰前的狀態。世界各國不但非當注意這件大事，而且都在積極地準備參加明年英偷之世運會的各項工作，如準備出席世運選手之挑選，選手技能之訓練等等，都在政府當局熱烈地倡導和各國體育專家的響應合作之下，正在迅速地進行之中。由此可知，世界各國對於參加明年世運會這件事情是非常重視的。　　在世界各國目前正在推進參加世運的準備工作中，尤以瑞典和蘇聯這兩個國家最為熱烈，瑞典的體育先進，已經在其太國傑姆蘭區的梵拉山谷之間，成立了世運訓練營，把全國最優秀的田徑能手徵選集中於此，再予以各種技能的訓練。蘇聯的情形雖然不像瑞典一樣，有世運訓練營之設立，但各項參加世運的準備工作，也正如風起雲湧一般地隨時推進着。蘇聯是採取競賽的方式，全國各地都在發動各項體育活動的競賽，如田徑，球類和拳擊等項，都已經在普遍性地發動或正在熱烈地舉行中。　　由上所述，我們可以知道世界各國對世運工作，不但引起普遍地重視，而且都正在興高采烈地準備着。現在，讓我們來回顧一下我們自己國內的情形。　　自從世運會將於明年在英倫舉行的消息透露以後，我國體育界的專家和主持體育活動的機構也非常注意這件事情，教育部也一度擬於本年舉行全國運動會以作準備，全國輿論界也曾熱烈地響應，報紙上也常見發表關於全國運動會方面的文字，大致的意見都相同，主張本年舉行全國運動會，藉以挑選優良的選手代表，準備參加明年的世界運動會。更重要的是要表示勝利後全國團結統一和平的深長的意義。　　但是醞釀已久的全國運動會，一直到現在還未有具體的決定，是否能够舉行，尙屬問題；主要的原因，由於經費的龐大，政府方面恐未能應付所致。但是這次全國運動會的舉行，意義非常重大，對於我國今後的體育事業，風氣，和心理方面均有很大的影饗。筆者深願這次全國運動會的舉行，能够實現。（上）華羅庚名著　　列入蘇聯出版計劃　　〔塔斯社莫斯科十六日電〕蘇聯科學院主席團，已批准一九四七年度科學著作出版計劃。去年出書二百五十種，今年計劃出書五百種，包括中國數學家華羅庚之名著。</p>

<p>馳訪工業基地鞍山鋼铁廠  瀋陽十二日航訊　本報東北特派員韓清濤　　鞍山鋼鐵事業，是中國整個工業化的起點，同時也是奠定中國工業的主要基地，因為這裏可以供給全國重工業所需的鋼鐵，以至這裏成了全國和全世界注視的焦點。　　從瀋陽坐火車到鞍山去，過了遼陽，就可看到有些靠近鐵路的工廠，過去偽滿鞍山大都市計劃，就是把遼陽的一部份，劃到鞍山去了。　　車近立山站，那偉大的重工業塲面，就展開在眼前，北邊的多半是鋼鐵廠的外圍工廠，過去是日人財閥的，像「神鋼」「住友」「大谷」的機械，金屬等重工業，此外還有一些其他日人所設立的「株式會社」。　　再往南就是鋼鐵公司的本廠了，建築物林立，高　　霄，蔚為大觀，鐵路綫，電車路，縱橫貫通，廠房內礦山脚，交通便捷，現在雖然是在大破壞中謀重建，已經從死寂裏有些生息了。　　復興費五萬萬元　　日人「鞍山製鋼所」，成立於民初六年，民國廿二年更名「昭和製鋼所」，到現在已經有卅多年的歷史了，在這卅多年裏，初創，長成，擴張，日人下了很大的資本，我們同胞流盡了血汗。　　東北光復，蘇軍有計劃的拆遷了新的和好的機器，共軍又加予函度的破壞，此外還有一些無知人民的搶刦，致使有名的大鋼鐵廠，幾乎剩下了空虛的軀殼。　　經濟部在卅五年首先派員接收，九月間又改由資委會經營，設立「資源委員會鞍山鋼鐵有限公司」，派定邵逸周為總經理，公司設有十四處，並修復委員會等機構，公司所擬復興計劃，已經中央核准第一期發經費國幣五百億元，現正開始重建，工程是相當艱鉅的。　　前製鋼所理事之一的「瀨尾喜代三」，在鞍山製鐵所從事鋼鐵工業，已經有十七八年的歷史了，他是學冶金的，現在，在公司顧問室當顧問，他和記者談起話來，大有不勝「今昔之感」，但工作精神還是相當好的。　　蘇軍拆共軍破壞破壞的情形，他曾參與和目睹，據他描述當時的情景說：「蘇軍來了，首先以調查設備為名，調查極為詳盡，畫好了符號，隨着命令拆卸，所拆卸的是新的和好的，拆卸計劃很完密，命令很嚴格，這樣規定着：妨碍拆卸的處死刑，怠慢工作的帶到軍事法庭訊辦，有些日本和中國工人，曾經受到第二項的罰辦。」　　「在拆卸技術指導上，是由蘇高級技術人員負責，同時蘇軍在旁監視拆卸工人，所有拆卸的機械，多半是從大連運走的，其餘也有些從安東方面，經過北鮮北運的。　　「結果，蘇軍拆走了三分之二的設備，但剩下的還可生產，同時鋼鐵廠附帶設備，並未拆多少，但去年五月廿五日，共軍二次進人鞍山市，在這一個星期間，燒掉了發電廠，破壞了三個煉鐵爐，當地人民們，也有搶刧行動，舉個例十來說：他們為了拿滾珠，曾不惜破壞整個馬達。」　　最後他說：「當共軍二次走的時候，把昭和製鋼所理事長安本帶走了，為什麽帶走，我們弄不淸楚，不幸的是安本的太太，為了這，在監牢裏自殺了！」　　現在，鞍山鋼鐵公司，留有日技術人員千餘人，加上眷屬，總數是五千多，有些眷屬的女孩子，就在公司辦公廳做傳送公文和倒茶掃地工作，以維持生活。開工工廠及設備內容　　電力廠　　（一）發電廠，（電力）卅五年九月廿日開工，設有發電機一二五〇〇Kw一座，最大八〇〇Kw。鍋爐六〇噸時一座，發電中。配電盤設備一套。（三〇〇〇KVA一架）。又卅五年十二月廿五日開工者，設有製鋼第一變電所，（三〇〇〇KVA一架，一二五〇KVA一架，）小型鋼材廠配電中。又卅六年一月廿日開工者，鍋爐六〇噸時一座。　　（二）水道組（水這）卅五年九月九日，及十一月廿六日開工者，首山水源地打水井四座，三座使用中。（每分一五M3三座，每分七五M3一座。）　　卅五年九月九日及十一月一日開工者，設有輸水唧筒（每分三〇M3座，一座使用中。　　卅五年九月十日及十二月八日開工者，設有千山河水源地輸水唧筒，（每分三〇M3一座，使用中。）（每分二〇M3）三座，尙未使用。　　卅五年十月二日及卅六年一月十三日開工者，設有廠內新水打水站輸水唧筒，（每分三〇M3）二座。　　酸素廠（氫氣）卅五年九月廿七日開工，設有每時六〇M3氧氣機，已經開工生產。　　煉鋼廠　　鐵合金廠（電石）卅五年十二月廿七日開工，設有爐五瓩一二五〇KVA座，已開工生產。　　軋鋼廠　　小型鋼材廠（元鋼）卅五年十二月卅日開工，年產七〇，〇〇〇瓩設備一套，已經開工生產。　　鋼輥廠（鋼輥）卅五年十二月廿五日開工，設有小型軋輥旋床二架，使用中。　　鋼管鋼綫廠：　　綫品第一廠（釘）卅五年十二月廿日開工，設有伸綫機（每日五瓩）一架，已經開工生產。製釘機（每日一八〇瓩）五架，磨釘機（每日六〇〇瓩）三架。　　綫品第二廠（鐵綫）卅六年一月廿日開工，設有伸綫機（每日三　）一套，受電設備一套。加熱爐二座。乾燥爐一座。　　鋼管第二廠（薄鐵皮）卅五年十二月廿八日開工，設有軋鋼機（三〇〇馬力）一座。改造加熱爐一座。受電設備一套。　　鋼繩廠（鋼繩）卅五年十一月廿一日開工，設有燒綫設備爐二座，已開工生產。洗綫設備，製綫設備五套。鍍鋅設備爐一座。鍍綫捲取機一套。試騐設備，工具設備，製繩設備一八架。繩心設備一五架。受電設備。　　運輸處：卅五年十二月卅一日開工，設有機車十一輛，五輛使用中。電機車三輛。貨車一七七輛。客車四輛。卡車九輛。修理機械十一架。卅五年十月廿日開工者，鑄有環市綫火車一套。十一月十五日開工者，有轉車台一套。十二月一日開工者，有起重機一套。又十二月卅一日開工者，廠內各鐵路一部。　　鑄造廠：第一廠（合金件）卅五年十月十五日開工者，堝坩爐，已開工生產。（冷鋼車輪用鐵模）卅五年十二月十日開工者，鑄有小型熔撇爐乾燥爐起重搬（一〇萬）三　。機械零件十噸　鐵爐一座。車輪，卅六年一月五以上均已開工生產。鍛製件，起重機五部。　火爐二座。反射爐（二〇電）一座。三　電氣爐一座。十五　　　一座及煤氣爐二座。鍋爐三　。　　第二廠（修　用機械零件）卅五年十一月廿日開工，起重機（一〇　）二架，已開工製造。工作機械（合格）一〇架。連結器完成，卅五年十一月十日開工，空氣壓縮機（一〇〇馬力）一架。修復用機械　　。起重機八套。車輪用鐵模，卅五年十二月十日開工，各種工作機械十九架。鋼輥卅五年十二月十五日開工，熔接機二架。　　第三廠（修復用機械零件）卅五年十一月十日開工，半　熔鐵爐一座，已經開工生產，十　熔　爐二座。甘　起重機一座。十　起重機一座。五處起重機一座。三　起重機一座．工作機械類五架受電設備一套　　修造廠　　第一廠（鑄件品）卅五年十一月十三日開工，化鐵爐一阡，三　，四　，五　各一座，已經開工生產。　合金件品，化鋼爐一座。懸　起重機三套。鍛造品，卅五年十二月一日開工，汽芻　阡一架。汽錘　瓩一架。鍋爐25OHO一座。零件加工，卅五年九月五日開工，工作機十九架縣樑起重機三架。鉚造品，卅五年十一月一日開工，鉚造機七部。空氣壓縮機三架。電焊機二十三架。懸樑起重機一架。起伏起重機二架。修造工程，卅五年九月一日開工，蒸汽起重機八架。起伏起重機四架。空氣壓縮機二架。捲揚機十五架。　　第二廠（通話）卅五年十二月廿四日開工，自動交換機（五十四綫）二台，使用中。眞通　石式電話器三十台。電動機修理，卅五年十二月卅日開工，工作機械五架。乾燥爐五〇Kw二座。電氣試騐，卅五年十二月卅日開工，試騐設備一套，試騐電　四四〇〇〇KV。　　製鑲廠（道釘）卅五年十二月廿五日開工，製鑲　九架，已經開工生產。（鉚釘）打尖機三架。（螺絲釘）工作機四架。（螺絲　，螺絲　）剪斷機一架。　　鐵塔廠（輸電鐵塔）卅五年十二月一日開工，切斷機二架，已經開工生產。鑽眼機二架。工作機三架。　　外匯匯率之穩定，而促進國際貿易這發展·七來中央銀行得着以增强控制金融市塲之力量，而　公開市塲活動之基礎。再股該劵將來在市塲上的作用，將遠勝於黃金，旣不需黃金的本錢亦不受存量的限制，更無黃金促長投機之性能。該劵之發行可任意隨市塲情形而放縮，當通貨繼續膨脹物價織鐵上漲時，該　偵值固因隨之升高，以吸游資而收平抑物價之效，但在通貨數量及物搜穩定時，該劵價値亦隨之穩定，當經濟情形好轉，物價下跌時，該劵又可兌出通貨，刺激物價回升，以防止工商業之虧蝕。凡此，實不勝列舉。惟筆者並非以為發行「物價指數國庫劵」就可解決我國全盤的物價問題，而是以他為解決我國物價問題的重心。前文曾提出管理通貨，利息，及物資是　定物價的三要素，但三要素中，尤以管理通貨是主動因素，單就物資及利息加以管理，並不見得有這樣相等的效果。當然，用其他的手段如調整金融機稱，緊縮投機信用，坩加生產貸款，改良運輸及生產工具，提倡科學管理與技術，商借國外實物或外幣貸款，發展股票市塲與出賣國營事業等，也未嘗不是辦法。但沒有通貨的管理，這些辦法或是行不通，或其效果會大打折扣，有了通貨的管理，這些辦法將更會發揚其效果。發行「物價指數國庫券」是針對我國經濟的病源下藥。這種通貨的管理手段具有充份的支配性，高度的彈性與適當的調劑性，只要政府確能隨時按物價指數維持該劵的兌換價値，而不失其信用，該劵將永為政府管理通貨及平抑物價的法寳！星期論壇論通貨管理並建議發行「物價指數國庫券」　（下）  李崇淮　　（三）國庫券在流通中，但國庫券的志出少於收進，換句話說，政府將付出通貨，因此增加負擔。　　（四）國庫劵停止流通，或人民以之全部向政府贖出通貨，或政府自動收回「物價指數國庫劵」，是則政府將有發行大量通貨的負擔。　　第（三）（四）兩種情形為吾人所應加研討者。　　首先，吾人應知者，即常政府在某種物價水準時向人民借錢，而另一種（上漲的）物價水凖時還錢，是不是增加政府額外的負擔？換句話說，這種借款在政府立塲看來，究竟合算不合算？舉例來說，當政府在某種物價水準時向人民借一億元，在一年以後物價上漲一倍時，要還人民兩億元，這是一〇〇％的利息，在政府是否爲一鉅大損失？　　從表面數字看來，政府多負擔一倍於本金的利息付出，誠然綦重。然而細想之後，則不禁令人失笑。假設的政府之借款不以貨幣計算，而以實物計算，其理將自明。設政府所借之一億元等於當時之二千擔米，在還價時米價已漲了一倍，則政府所償還者將仍為二千石米耳。無論物價上漲幾倍，政府何嘗增加實際的負擔？因為在貨幣加速貶値時期，賬面負債增加，但事實上與在物價穩定時發行公債之情形何異？再說，政府所增加償付的通貨，其印刷成本甚微，並非眞實負擔，不過仍然借用人民的購買力而已。問題不在政府的負擔增加，而是其所增發的貨幣對於整個經濟的影響何如耳。　　十二　「物價指數國庫券」之作用　　當人民（普遍地）不欲繼續的購買「物價指數國庫券」而願以國庫劵兌回法幣時，其心理乃是對法幣的信任增加。這種情形，在通貨膨脹業已過止或物價轉趨下跌時才發生。這時，國內的政治，必已相當的進步，生產亦有相當的增加，政府財政亦將趨穩健。物價長足上漲固非應有的現象，而物價下跌時亦有害於工商發展甚鉅。故最穩的經濟狀態是物價平穩，或很慢的在上漲。當人民恐懼物價下跌，而以國庫劵兌換法幣時，此種舉動對於全體經濟恰可發生一種制衡作用，因為政府收回國庫劵而付出通貨時，此種通貨之增加，正可以緩和物價的下跌，而使一般工商業免於受物價下跌的影響而虧蝕。當人民兌換國庫劵之數額足以使通貨再行膨脹，物價再度上漲時，則兌賬之舉必至减少或停止。筆者前歲參觀美國TNA時，發現保持水力常度的原理。因爲河流水量的多寡是有季節性的，而水閘的發電機需要維持常度的水量，因此工程家在每一水閘的上流，築一蓄水沼（Reservoir），在洪水時期，此蓄水沼可以吸收一部洪水而减輕水閘的壓力，在枯水時期，永沼之水反灌入正流，以增加河身的水量，因此河流季節性的盈枯得以調劑。最近水利委員會薛篤弼氏來漢，謀商創挖天祐垸，也就是為長江謀一調劑水量盈枯的蓄水沼。筆者提出發行「物價指數國庫券」，也就是根據這個原理。惡性通貨膨脹，有如「洪水」之來，用「堵堤」的辦法不是根本解決的辦法，而應因勢利導，另儲「蓄水沼」以分其勢，待物價下跌時仍將「所儲通貨」注入經濟體中，以維持物價的平穩。　　由此以觀，若此「蓄水池」運用得法，則將永為政府調劑通貨之工具，並無須廢除。易言之，即實無完全收回「物價指數國庫劵」之必要也。如政府實欲全部收回，斯時財政經濟必已趨正規，工商業已轉繁榮，政府之租稅及國營事業之收入亦必大量增加，無須依賴發行通貨及公債（即「物價指數國庫劵」）來彌補收支之不足。是則「物價指數國庫券」之使命業已完成，屆時政府收回國庫劵之手段，勢必跟隨通貨整理之政策，如發行新單位的貨幣然。　　退一萬步來講，不論「論價指數國庫券」的收回是由於何種原因，或對我國的經濟影響怎樣，人民決心一致向政府兌匯，或政府毫無基礎地向人民收回全部國庫券的負債，則其影響也絕不壞於未曾發行此種債券之情况，吾人應知此種債券原係通貨的凍結，如無此種債券發行，則市塲上至少有等額的鈔票流通（事實上將不止於此，因此種「活躍」的鈔票勢將刺激新發行也）。假設吾人於若干時日後發行新幣以代替舊幣及購取國庫劵，則新幣之數量乘上新幣與舊幣的比例將等於舊幣發行的總和加上「物價指數國庫券」的負債，因爲「物價指數國庫券」所代表的舊幣數量，少於因未曾發行該券而應增加的通貨數量，或至少與其相等，是則政府決不因「物價指數國庫劵」的發行而於將來更改幣制時增加新幣之負担也。　　十三　發行「物價指數國庫劵」之效果與影響　　至於發行「物價指數國庫券」對於全體經濟的效果與影響究竟何如？此在細閱前文以後已知有相當的答覆。發行「物價指數國庫劵」以後，一來人民的剩餘購買力有了去路，可以减少人民對於物資囤積的需要，物價上漲可以緩和。二來因為人民將儲入銀錢行莊大部份的錢改用於投資該劵，以及銀錢行莊亦願將自身資金投資於此，勢將緊縮商業及投機的信用，而减少物價上漲之勢。三來政府收回這筆通貨，可以再用於財政支出以節省通貨之發行，從而緩和惡性通貨膨脹之威脅。四來政府可以利用這筆收回的通貨，透過國家銀行作為貸放正當工商及交通公用事業信用的膨脹，從用而增加生產及物資流通，收平抑物價之效。五來因物價漲勢緩和，短期利息被迫下落，對於正當工商業，不無鼓勵。六來因國內幣値得以維持，有助於　　十四　提高國家銀行存息之效果不能與之比擬　　在本文草成之際，盛傳政府將提高國家銀行存款利率以吸游資，或謂此舉可以代替「物價指數國庫券」之發行。筆者以為發行「物價指數國庫券」與提高存款利率，二者實不可同日而語。前者之作用遠較後者優越，其理由如次：　　（一）存自是銀行的成本，放息是工商業的成本。國家銀行提高存款利率是增加其成本，國家銀行爲顧及其成本起見，勢將增加放款利率，如此則增加工商業的負擔，而刺激物價之上漲。如使國家銀行不增加其放息，則政府或中央銀行必須貼補國家銀行利息之損失。　　（二）金融市塲利率息息相關，國家銀行存款利率提高，勢將影響金融市塲不正常的反應。若存款利率僅提高一二厘，於事實無補；若提高至足與商業銀行錢莊競爭存款時，勢必引起金融市塲之騷動。蓋商業行莊欲維持金融業務，勢必也隨之提高存款利率以相競爭也。如國家銀行能以低利貸無限制地供給市塲需要，則商業行莊勢將紛紛倒閉，而使整個金融機構發生空前危機，倒不如乾脆停止國家銀行以外之行莊業務。設國家銀行不能無限制地供給工商業之低利貸，換句話說，，商業行莊的資金尙有出路的話，則其放款利率將更為提高，而刺激物價之上漲。「物價指數國庫券」之利息雖高，但與市塲利率完全隔離，其雖有與商業行莊競爭存款之嫌，但其性質畢竟與存款不同也。蓋以「物價指數國庫券」所吸收的游資，側重在「社會儲蓄」一方面，商業銀行仍有活動之餘地也，「物價指敢國庫劵」雖已發行，若闕家銀行不提高利率，一般市塲利率絕不會曾高，反又而可以因物價之平抑而降低。　　（三）再說，「物價指數國庫券」所付的「利息」，與一般銀行利率的性質亦有不同。一般銀行利率是銀行與顧客在「成交」時預先言明的契的，洽定後不能隨意更改的。假設利率定得太低，而物價仍長足上漲時，其利率幷不能隨時提高，以補償人民儲蓄的損失。假設利率定得太高，萬一物價下跌，則該利率亦不能立即貶低，以自失銀行信用。「物價指數國庫券」所付「利息」不是事先釘定的利率而是事後償付的代價，可以隨時按物價漲落情形而調整，具有高度的彈性，遠非提高銀行之存款利率所可此擬。　　（四）提高銀行存款利率，在物價上漲時，其吸收游資的效果亦遠不若「物價指數國庫券」來得强。蓋其所提高之利率，受種種的牽制，決不能有如「物價指數國庫劵」之「利息」那樣高（在物價上漲時），亦決不足保持人民的儲蓄價値，當然其對於游資之引誘力亦不如「物價指數國庫券」之大。　　（五）發行「物價指數國庫券」除吸收游資外，尙有管理通貨及本文第四節以後所述稱種之功用，提高國家銀行存息則不能有那樣理想的圓滿結果。　　職是之故，發行「物價指數國庫券」仍將為吸收游資，管理通貨，平抑物價之最良方法。（完）卅六年二月底於漢口關於拆遷和鞍山鋼鐵廠三景　（上）一部分煉鐵爐（中）右邊是煉廠的烟囱，左邊是電力廠冷却塔（下）鞍山鋼鐵廠遠景（本報特派員韓淸濤寄）　　高聳入雲的煉鐵爐（本報特派員韓清濤寄）</p>

<p>春秋愛念  灃莉　　上帝呀，降災給我吧！　　我殺死了一隻無辜的羔羊，　　靑年的朋友呀，咀咒我吧！　　我毀滅了一顆純潔的心靈，　　傑進D公司是在公司開幕的前一天，我進D公司是在開幕前一星期。我初次會見傑，覺得他是一個服裝整齊，面露笑容的快樂靑年，常時，我並沒有想認識他的意思。　　為了公司將要開幕，我們都忙碌地工作着，當我工作完畢，因為要透一口氣，我便走過去看傑，他的工作還是那樣的多，我不免有些同情，於是在無意間說了一句，「還有那麽多要寫嗎？」傑回答，「是呀，今天一定要寫完。一這就是我們談話的開始　　公司開幕，我臨時被派去管理麥克風，傑也派在那間置麥克風的房間工作，揭幕剪彩以後，商塲中非常熱閙，我想去看看盛况，但是我不能離開麥克風，傑願意代我看管一會，讓我出去玩玩。當時我奇怪像他那樣快樂的人為什麼不喜歡熱閙，以後纔知道他是有理由的。　　公司開幕的三天中是供給晚膳的。第二天晚飯後，傑伴我回家。那晚明月正是圓的時候，我們慢慢的走着。到了我的家門口，我不敢進去，我怕他知道我的家，等我們走過了相當的距離，我纔說聲「明天見！」然後反轉方向走，傑笑了一笑，好像明瞭我的意思，頭也不回的去了，我覺得傑是非常的可愛。　　一天，傑要請我看電影。「提起看電影，我便聯想到傑坐在我旁邊是多麼不自然。於是我回答他：「看電影，這是一個多麼難回答的問題！因為我從來都是一個人去看的，我雖不敢拒絕你的好意，我也不能接受你的提議，我祗能說謝謝，對不起。我誠懇的希望你不要因為我而失去玩的機會。」因此傑也就沒有去看，我心裏非常過意不去。　　我是喜歡音樂的，傑又要請我聽音樂。他託他同桌的劉先生回家時到蘭心戲院去買兩張票，我請求劉先生祗買一張，劉先生說不願意買一張，因為買一張不能償還鞋子的損失。結果沒有買。我又覺得太對不起傑，他又因我失去一次玩的機會。　　又一天，我寫了張紙條給傑，「我是非常抱歉，因為我不願意尋找麻煩，更不願使你失望，世界是這樣的大，你為什麽要找我？」　　傑的回答說：「你眞聰明，被你猜着了，當我剛認識你的時候，就有這意思，我感到這是天意，但我不敢在我們剛認識不久就向你表示，現在你旣然說明，我們暫且不談那問題，假如將來有可能性的話，再談吧。」　　我回答他，「我願你不要這樣希望，我可以吿訴你，絕對沒有可能性的，因為我喜歡你，所以預先給你暗示，以免將來使你失望。」　　以後公司下班時，我們當是一起走。我們常繞道萬國墳山，靑年人是喜歡墳墓的。我們批評着一座一座的墳墓，我說：「我願意在這裏選一塊地睡下，你來祭我好嗎？」傑說：「對不起，我不能祭你，我要先走了！」我們相顧　　　　　公司在星期日下午也要辦公，並且也供給午膳，一天我來遲了，沒有趕上午膳時間，遇見傑，傑問我：「吃過飯嗎？」我本能的回答，「沒有吃，你請客吧！」傑立刻回答：「好的。」我知道話說錯了，不應坦白的說，給他機會，我趕緊又說吃過了，　不相信，他一定要請我，他說，「你說的沒有吃飯，我請客，」　　通不過，非常後侮。到了餐室門口，我還是有些不願意，但是一方面我又餓，我想這也許是命運，我於是不敢違反天命，在餐室中，傑坐在我的對面，吸着香烟，喝着咖啡，我忽然想起柏拉圖的一句話，女子吃東西的能度是難看的，我望一望傑，傑並沒有望着我，他實在是可愛。　　傑是一向為我服務着，有一次我的抽屜壞了，傑低着頭替我修理，他的領帶被抽屜木板鉗住了，他還不知道，我說：「你看看你的領帶！」傑一看，「啊呀」一聲，他自己也笑了。因此，我便非常喜歡那條領帶—一條紅色加白點的領帶。　　傑曾送過我許多東西，我實在受之有愧，我對他說：「你所送給我的東西太多了，我怕那對於你是一種損失。他說：「你能收下我的東西，我已經滿足了。」直到傑把最後的東西送給我，我眞嚇壞了。我不知他對我的感情在無形中已進入絕境，實在也是我太不小心。　　有一天，傑給了我一封信，信中附着一塊玉。那信裏說：　　「……現在我給你一件東西，那是我的心，你看看牠上面的雕刻是多麼有意義！請你千萬不要使我失望。」　　我連忙拿起那塊玉一看，上面刻着一對鴛鴦，我的手一顫，那塊玉落在桌上，我慌了，勉强鎭靜，慢慢拿起來，反覆細看，還好，沒有摔破一點，不然我是一定要收下了。　　我回了一封信，我說：「煩惱終於降臨了，友誼這美麗的名詞是騙人的，人類的自私是本能的。我不是結婚的人，我是愛好自由的。如果你認為男女間沒有友誼的存在，那麼再會吧！」　　在公司裏看見傑，他穿得很漂亮，白色的西裝，打着那條紅色加白點的領帶，微笑着。我非當高興，以為一切煩惱都沒有了。這天晚上是一個暴風雨之夜，半夜我從夢中醒來，窗外一片漆黑，靜聽狂暴的風雨聲，心裏起了一陣無名的恐懼，我細細追尋這恐懼的原因，一點綫索也得不到，我覺得沒有一件事是可使我恐懼的。第二天，傑沒有來。我問劉先生，知道他是病了。他的身體是很好的，怎麽會生病？難道是我的信把他氣病了？若是這樣，我實在對不起他。　　傑死的消息終於傳到了，我非常詫異，傑怎麽這樣快就死了？這時候傑的信也來了，我望着他的信封心裏很難過，連忙拆開來，是用航空信箋寫的，展開紙箋，一張像片落下，我對他的像片望了望，眼淚立刻湧出來，在視綫模糊裏，我讀着他的信：　　一莉：　　你不會再有煩惱了，因為使你煩惱的一個靑年他一定會離開你，永遠不會再和你見面。　　祝你永久的快樂！　　傑絕筆　月　日晨三時」　　再拿起像片反過來一看，那上面寫着；　　「他是因為多情而犧牲的，生前你是愛他，死後請你好好的保留他。」我的筆  中原　　我倦了。歪着頭，側着身，斜　在床頭。我的疲乏的眼睛從床頭望過去，我看見，在窗口的桌子上，靜靜地放着我的筆。　　我的筆巳經舊了。黑亮的桿身變成灰黃。自銅的筆鋏泛出靑緣。寬大的筆套已經有一角破裂。尖滑的筆頭，磨得圓笨組大，而且銹跡班斑了。　　但是我的筆是好的。牠是一個忠實的伴侶，已經伴了我十二年了。十二年前，我還在學校裏讀書。有一天一個朋友來看我，吿訴我他要往法國去做事，不知什麽時候再能回來。但是他呌我不要哭，他從袋裹摸出一枝筆，塞到我手裏，輕輕的說；「你要用這枝筆寫信給我，永遠永遠」！　　我不可能「永遠永遠」寫信給他，但是我就此一直藏着這一枝筆。　　我藏着這一枝筆，用牠來寫下過千千萬萬的字。我快樂的時候用牠來表達心中的喜樂，痛苦的時候借牠來發洩胸頭的沉悶。寂寞的時候藉牠作排遣，疾病的時候從牠得安慰。最後，在飢寒交還的時候，靠着牠，竟能半溫半飽地度過了六年最最困苦的日子！　　我在困苦的日子裏作了一個胆怯的懦夫，我的筆，也跟着我做了一個胆怯的懦夫。我向飢餓屈膝，向疾病求饒，向隆隆的砲聲和熊熊的烈火發出卑微的顫慄。我的筆，也在棲棲皇皇之中，向寒冷屈膝，向貧窮求饒，向隆隆的砲聲和熊熊的烈火發出卑微的顫慄。　　我的筆，無數次跟着我在狂風暴雨之下，躍躍欲試地想做一個勇敢的戰士，想抬起頭，仰起身，推起筆直的胸脯大步邁進。然而砲來了，火來了，山崩海裂的狂濤湧來了！我身無片甲，手無寸鐵。終於我只能低下頭去，無助地嘆息了；我的筆也跟着我低下頭去，無助地嘆息了。　　我的筆，曾在春天的花園裏讚美過鮮艷的花朶，也曾在冰凍的雪地上痛器過僵硬的屍首。我的筆尖走進過錦繡的天堂，也曾深入過慘苦的地獄。我在無星無月之夜，幻想過我的筆桿能像一根萬能的魔杖，隨手一揮，飛散出滿天明亮的火花來照亮世界。我也曾在紅酒燈綠之下，默禱着我的筆尖能像一顆有力的巨彈，輕輕一摔，放射出滿地烈火來燒毀一切狂妄和虛偽。我為我的筆尖架起過一所華燦的樓台，我用孩子的歡笑和慈母的歌聲來裝飾樓台四角。我也為我的筆尖疏通過一條寬暢的河道，我用壯士的鮮血和英雄的淚珠來點綴河岸的單調。我曾願我的筆桿成功一把堅硬的快劍，對準撒旦的毒頸用力一斬。我又曾願我的筆桿成功一管溫柔的輕笛，附和着天使的銀簫，在似永似畫的月夜。……　　我的筆，暗舊，灰黃；但牠是一個忠實的伴侶，伴了我十二年了！　　我的筆，渺小，軟弱；但他給了我生命和希望，使我的靈魂　醒了十二年了！　　我倦了。現在我默默地躺在床上，我的筆靜靜地放在桌上。但是不多一會，等到我的精力充沛，我就要從床上挺起身來，用更加有力的手臂舉起我的筆！（卅六年三月寄自松江）松間聽瀑  趙桐蔭低訴篇  黃宗津　　記得童年時候，有一次，我熟睡在母親的縫紉的桌上，醒來時，四週是靜寂得像這人世上，僅有我們兩個人，我說：　　　媽，我也夢着飛呢。　　唔，是的，你是有一天要飛的。　　這時，母親流下顆顆眼淚，低訴命運的悲哀，一顆一針，仍補綴我的破衣，於是我感到一種可怕的寂寞的痛苦，號啕地投入母親的懷抱。　　之後，母親呵，我帶着一顆寂寞的心，在天南地北間飄浪，在我的週圍永遠盤旋着生疏與虛偽……。　　然而，我想我還是幸福的，我應該比什麽人都溫暖些。因為那一個穿着綠背心的挑郵包的同志，在那兒，跨過千山萬水，把母親的溫聲的言語帶給我。　　可是，母親呵，現在我獨步在冬天的村道上，道旁衰草嘲笑我，無數匍伏地下的墳墓，也敞開石門，誘惑我：　　「這裏是門，上這裏來便有溫暖。」　　當時，我聽到長眠者恬靜的鼾聲，和頭頂上底白雲的脚步………。　　啊，母親呵，冬天的路該是短的？路的盡頭該是繁花和茂草，以及雲雀的歌聲編織成的，麗陽溫煦的春天……。　　昨夜，我夢見我跪在聖母瑪利亞的面前，我，以聖潔的雙手，高舉着，求她給我以熾熱的愛情的種子，並求她給我以爽朗的預言，說是冬天下種，來春出芽，開花……。　　瑪利亞，聖母瑪利亞啊，低着羞澀的頭，彷彿在她心底又一次漾上了往事。　　唉，為什麽在夢中也不能如願啊，我哭了，我洶湧的淚水，把生命的小舟划向醒的彼岸…………。　　睜開惺忪的睡眼，看見窗外黑漆的夜空上，有一顆金星，撑着生命的明燈，它啊，愛着土地愛得多麽深沉，於是已引起了我的母愛的溫馨的憶念。占卜及其他  方舟　　占卜　　命運是支狡黠底蛇，　　當你試想捉住它時—　　它便從指縫中像水般滑掉了。　　別幻想一張「鏟形騎士」　　會使你碰到好運，　　而一張「紅心皇后」　　吿訴你有一段美滿愛情；　　因為生活底組成原是一串偶然　　再綴上千萬個誘惑底迷圈，　　有歡笑也有眼淚，　　上帝却從未安排了「絕對」。　　採朶開得最豔麗底花吧！　　朋友，因為在明天—　　它將永從你底心頭枯萎。　　邂逅草　　像一顆流屋滑過天際，　　最難忘的是你那一笑輕盈；　　圓舞曲從手風琴上如烟般升起，　　從你底眼中　　我領悟了水仙底幽麗。　　尙記否臨行前一聲低呼？　　在你鬢邊，　　有人以顫抖底手插上一朶康乃馨；　　為恐你已悄然拭去唇上底半絲微笑，　　我乃尋思於已遺忘了底詩句。墳祭  默之　　回到家鄕的第二天，年老的父親從勇我到墳田裏去祭拜祖宗的墳墓，為了表示我遊子歸家的孝意，我滿口答應了。　　雖然是短時間的離家，但院子裏立刻呈出冷淸淸的，滿頭白髮的老母，孤零零的依在大門口，向凄凉的曠野凝望。　　在斜陽的殘照裏，冬尾的原野，特別顯出寒冷和蕭條，我的心在悲惻着跳動。父親默默地走着，我拿着錢紙，祭菜，也一聲不響的跟在後面，雖然兒童時期的影子不時浮泛起來，但心是一直的沉甸甸地。踏進了墳田的邊緣，三五隻寒鴉，呱呱地從墳後飛起，這悲慘的鴉啼，逼使我潛浮在心底下的熱淚湧將出來了。　　我離開家，經過這殘酷地，漫長的歲月，家裏就有好幾位與世長逝，一位小妹妹死在荒年，大哥死於敵人機關槍的掃射下，三伯母死於垂老的疾病，無情的時光，糧荒，敵人，結束了她們的生命；今天，一杯杯的黃土，蓋遮了她們的屍體，悲怨……　　父親見我哀慟的沉默着，他像預防更悲傷來襲似的躱在一邊，想像完全沉浸在過去殘破的記憶裏，不，他在感觸人生的淒凉吧！　　我在祖父的墳前，點燃着香燭，將祭菜擺好，虔誠的跪下來，將錢紙焚着，當我叩頭的時候，這錢紙被風刮跑了，我不覺更悲傷起來。一陣沉默後，我又去祭拜伯母，大哥，小妹妹的墳墓，這時，我童年的生活，像潮水似的湧來，我的靈魂，彷彿投到冥冥然的國度。祖父母用溫慈的手，撫摩我的前額，伯母也蹣跚着脚步趕來問長敘短，哥哥手牽着妹妹的手，也像歡迎我的回家……　　「死得最可憐的還是你妹妹，」父親湊近我，並且眼裏流着淚「病的時候，她想吃麵食，但年景正是閙糧荒，家裏弄些樹葉，楡樹皮來過日子，那裏有麵給她？你母親爲着這事，東跑西去，也沒有弄到，祇有用話騙她：『你二哥回家的時一候，給你帶來，等一等……』她在死前的昏迷中，還問：二哥回來了沒有？』你母親祗是哭……」　　父親悲傷的陳述着，右手抖顫地將淚擦掉。　　「大哥呢？」我為了减少父親的悲泣，岔轉了話題。　　「他的死像命運裹註定了，你大嫂在她娘家裏，他非去看望一下不可，就在路途上，被鬼子的機槍射中，把他抬回家的時候，已死了。」父親慨嘆的吁了一口氣。　　回想我離家的前二年，大哥和大嫂親熟的宛如一個人，時常聯合起來和母親作對。我想，大哥殭臥在棺不的時候，大嫂哭號的眼淚，一定比其他的人多。　　淡黃的太陽光，微弱的從西山凹處閃射出來，像垂死的老人，作着費力的呼吸似地消失下去，墳田裏已黯淡起來，我收拾起祭菜，踽躅的跟在父親的背後回家。　　晚風呼嘯，大地靜寂的睡去一寸山河一寸血　202  葉勁風　　以上這一反一正的思想衝突，在我心上，只是如同閃電一般，一掠即成過去。這一點意思，也許早被那位極度機警的w君看透了，因此我剛站起來，預備尋覓他這個裝置的當口，他早伸手把座前書桌的一隻抽屜拉開，撥弄了一下，立刻就有收音機一般的聲音發了出來，這時一聽那淸脆圓潤的嗓音，就知是萍子在說話：　　「大哥，您弄錯了，她並不是要冒充川島芳子來嚇唬您。」　　原來他們擬在討論那位冒牌「金司令」的事。　　「不是　　人，又是為什麼？這是　見的聲音」　　萍—芳十這傢伙，有她的一貫作風，她挑選訓練出來的幾個手下，只要是女子，都算她的替身。所以她們無論上那裏去，只要對方不認識，就會把「「芳子」這臭牌十實扛出來。」　　鶴—什麼用意，除了唬嚇人以外？　　萍—頭一個用意，她本人用不着在外勞動，功勞却是現成的。第二，這一類的工作，都是性命抓在手心裏的，犧牲了一個手下，她的姓名，在上司們那裏，又增加了一重光榮。還有第三點，她這麽幹，也是她工作上的一種技巧，至少要呌對方的人，弄得糊里糊塗，不知道眞的芳子，究竟是誰……　　鶴—傢伙也許不大知道我的來歷？　　萍—我想她們都很淸楚。　　鶴—那麼，又為什麼要故意同我搗蛋？　　萍—我認為也有兩點——　　鶴—第一點？　　萍—特意要跟您搗蛋，因為土肥原不會放過您的，雖然您也參加了黑龍會，却是因為近衛太看重您了。　　鶴—哈……那個第二點？　　萍—第二點更危險；我雖不曾聽見他們—松井·酒井·今井·芳子·籘尾，這些人—雖不曾聽見他們明說您同「有嫌疑的人」來往……　　鶴—什麼？……他們在監視我？　　萍—最敢……可也不必監視，只問您為什麼住在這裏？　　鶴—哼？……這裏為什麽不可以住？你不是也在這裏嗎？　　萍我不必怕他們，因我的任務是短期的，大哥您就不能這麽說哪！L托爾斯泰語錄  金寧譯　　在我們的世界，一切活着人們，不但應具眞理，至少也應有認識眞理的信念，最好是以堅毅的決心　可能的機會去追求人類生活法則的眞理。　　獨泊漫談  王聰　　我國人最喜歡在自己同姓中找幾個歷史的英雄，作為自己的祝宗。姓文的人，必自承為文天祥的後裔，其實，文山先生的血統早就斷絕了。　　孔二先生在這一個觀念下，顯然是進步的，他說：「犁牛之十，醉且角；雖欲勿用，山川其舍諸？」　　禹是鯨的兒子，紂是商湯的後人；榮幸和恥辱，止乎己身。這不比做官；沒有什慶可依附的　　我反對一切，高攀生殖器關係的人。　　好名心並不完全是壞事，這只看生活態度如何？所走的路綫如何？　　屈原說：「老冉冉其將至兮，恐脩名之不立。」　　孔仲尼說：「君子疾沒世，而名不稱焉。」替歷史的天空頗一道燦爛的長虹，當然是一件最美麗最偉大的工作。　　至於殺了人，還要假慈悲地大笑一頓，以求善名的；總是令人寒心的事。　　至於，長虹在天地，他無法，事實上也不必喚開百葉窗裹沉睡的厲鬼，瞻仰他自已的眴爛。　　還是孔仲尼有一句話說得好：「君子病無能　，不病人之不己知也。」文藝巨片「孽緣」中新人蓋梅狄遜迴避任用家屬  長空　　人家確立了人事制度，獲得了高度的工作效能。　　而咱們這一家—五千年華炎子孫，却始終不脫以「個人」為中心的「門風」。不管機關也好，學校也好，團體也好，只要是有這麼一塊「方印」，一塊「條戳」，那裏裏外外，往往從大門口的傳達一直到「內務」，你準可以聽到「一家子」的「鄕土語」。至於他們的關係，更不用說，妻丈，妻味，妻舅，外甥，姪女，姪女婿，霸佔了整個機關；傳達，文書，秘書，出納，庶務……那一個不是「自己」口袋裏掏出來的人物？　　有人說：這便是中國官塲的縮形，這話，還替中國人遮了半邊羞；其實，中國民族，什麽事都為「個人」「家屬」打算。　　佛語：「一人昇佛，鷄犬登天」。中國歷代官塲，相習成風，只要家族一人騰達，五親四族均往投奔，於是弄得糟不堪言！　　這一種家族式的政治，在涮淸政風的大前提下，我們是應該雷厲禁絕的了。　　一省，一縣，一個機關，一個首長的調動，因為人事的整個調遺，常常使整個機構，工作停頓二三個月。　　這，像什麼話！　　銓叙部日昨決定任用公務員辦法中，有一條特別規定，說是機關首長對於配偶，血親，姻親，應迥避任用；道正是準對中國現狀的一帖「對症湯藥」！希望這碗黃湯，能救救中國機關家屬化的絕症，同時也為中國官塲和一切機關化的團體學校，洗涮洗涮骯臓的「門風」！自由談飛機票漲價了　航行可以保障安全麼？  高武弘　　去年聖誕夜起，聖誕老人給飛機帶來了厄運，飛機失事案，接踵發生，乘客們遭了「飛來橫禍」，死的死，傷的傷，哭聲震天，慘不忍聞。追究責任咧，請求賠償咧，受難家屬的控訴咧，輿論的指摘咧，……鬧了一個時期，也沒有什麼效果。從那時候起，飛機眞的成了「危機」，好端端的飛出去，碰碰就失事墜毀，人們都把空路捷徑視為畏途，避之若蝎，不要一上天，就被送入「西天佛國」，乘飛機眞要抱着「視死如歸」的「大無異」精神，纔敢去嚐試。　　現在雖然時隔未久，却也可以算是「事過境遷」了。死的死了，這些事件留給人們的印象，也漸漸冲淡了下去，停航多時的中國中央兩航空公司，已奉命於本月十六日晨恢復國內各綫飛航，中國公司飛出客貨機十八架，中央公司飛出客貨機七架。同時喧傳已久的飛機票漲價事，兩公司也已於復航前一日接到交通部電令：「准予酌情加百分之一百五十或百分之二百」，隨着復航同時實行了。　　本年度國營交通工具增價，當以此為第一聲。大槪因為兩公司停航了不少日子，損失綦重，所以「特准增價，以資彌補。」可以在乘客頭上，撈回一部分損失，飛機漲價使其他火車輪船，不久當然也將「跟進」。筆者有一位朋友，去冬即想到加爾各答去一次，起初飛機一再失事，並不是他胆子小，而是他的太太不放心，行期一誤再誤，以後索性飛機停了航，最近那方面有信來一定要他去一次，他預備待航綫恢復了就搭機前往，聽說票價漲了一倍多，他連呼：「硬傷」！時間，事業，金錢上的三項損失，都無從計算。　　乘飛機雖然危險，但飛機畢竟是最便利迅速的交通工具，可以省去不少麻煩，有事情的人，總不能因危機而不去乘它；况且照迷信說法，遇到這類事情，也是「命中註定」，否則也像中頭彩一樣的難以「適逢其會」。　　飛機復航了，票價增加了百分之一百五十至二百，但不知兩公司當局，對乘客的安全保障，也有了切實的改善沒有？希望也能像票價一樣，給乘客以百分之百的安全，因為人們以前乘飛機，就像把生命交給了航空公司當局，或死或生，聽候命運的判斷。　　春光爛漫，長空萬里，祝票價高漲後的航行飛機，能夠得到切實的保障。眼兒媚  胡盧　　洋員　　大亨多喜用洋員，活寳一般看！碼頭管理，交關優待，高俸金元！　　洋房頂給洋津大，洋月亮何妍？洋員盛氣，華員歎氣—個個「洋盤」！　　註：中信局用一英國人為碼頭管理員，月薪百餘英磅，津貼國幣二百多萬元，並以一萬二千美金頂房屋給他居住。說朗曹端方——清末官塲貪侈外史之二  愛菊　　　金玉錦繡之享用，貪也，即書畫金石之嗜好，亦貪也淸季　普，旗員中漂亮人物，有口號曰：大榮小那端老四，那為　軒相國，端即直督午橋也。榮為何人，則余忘之矣。那與端皆余會典館同事，那之尊人，與先君己酉同年，那又為伯兄乙酉同年，端則工部郞中，為先君所保京察一等也。故二人與余皆甚稔，端且强與余兄弟三人，通蘭譜焉。（余兄弟最不喜此惡習，故端强而後可）。　　至端罷直督後，居黃米胡同半畝園，與予僅一墻之隔，時予官戎曹，衙參散後，幾無日不相過從，或間日因事不往，則遣使走請，同賞書畫。余今述端之身世，可分三時代。一為郞曹時代；二為灞昌道至鄂督江督時代；三為直督及退休遇害時代。　　方其在郞曹初露頭角也，先公任工尙時，甚賞其才華，謂與鐵寳臣（良），實為部中二傷，故二人同在先公任內，保京察一等，列門下焉·（得一等者例稱門生）午橋承盛伯羲祭酒之餘風，酷慕風雅，尤好與深人結納，故甲午時之張鄭文（芸閣），戊戍時之康梁沈（寐叟），皆交好甚密。端且自稱本漢裔陶姓，其時最喜搜羅新出土之碑石，十大皆墓志銘，徧植所居庭院，若叢葬焉；每拓以贈人，實有至淸之品。聞人有淸書畫，輙過訪索觀，有時且乾沒巧取之。伯羲逝後，所蓄亦少數歸其篋筒。性好狎邪，西城口袋胡同，多旗人破落戶，為私倡，端有時且衣冠至其下處，甚為人指目，可笑也。當戊己之際，黨人駢戮，唐梁出亡，端於是搖身一變，作勸善歌，梓之徧送交遊（歌之內容，為忠君愛國，且反對戊戍黨人議論），　緣李蓮英，達之慈禧，慈禧閱之大喜，端乃以京察記名，簡放直隸　昌道矣，可不謂之機警過人乎？（上）哀雙頭怪嬰　我為他們命運悲　也為他們解脫喜  王後　　兩體連生的楊姓怪嬰，由於左邊的一個突患肺炎，牽連到右邊的一個，終於同時死去。距離生時，約有八個月。這樣的怪嬰究竟能夠活多少時候，並無定論。記得暹邏曾經有過一對，可是他們一直活到成年。那末楊姓怪嬰終是一種夭折，是其所以可哀也。　　上帝創造亞當與夏娃，都是乾乾凈凈一個身子，而怪嬰却異想天開，兩個身子併在一起，有巧奪天工之嫌，是其死亡，也許是上帝的一種責罰吧。　　怪嬰出世以後，就供人展覽，據說生意興隆，門庭若市，而怪嬰也就因為不勝其疲勞而得病。（報載如此）而死亡了。可是反過來想一想，怪嬰在八個月中所面對的人，已經不少，或者還勝過某些人一生所看見的人數（何况他有兩對眼睛），在八個月中他替主人所賺的錢，更比某些人一生所賺的多一些，那末他雖然祇活八個月，也總算不負此生，可以瞑目而去了。　　而且這樣的怪嬰，充其量能活多少時候？一個肉體，兩個靈魂（兩個頭也），我想他果然長大成人的話，其身體上所感受的不便，一定遠不如他兩個靈魂的衝突所造成的痛苦。　　迷信的人一定要說，此孩前生造孽，所以上帝給他吃兩頭的痛苦。幽默的人會說這是兩個小孩。搶着投胎，上帝一時分不出第一第二，祇能讓他們兩個一同出來（普通雙胞胎也有先後），也算是對於他們不知謙讓的一種責罰。　　總而言之，明明是一個肉體，却要硬生生分成兩個，分而却又不離，實實在在是一種痛舌，一種天譴，一個怪。　　我為怪嬰之命運悲，我又為怪嬰之解脫喜。繁榮之秘訣  景初譯　　美國勞工聯合會對其會員最近的報吿中，有下面一段有效而且正確的意見。這種意見雖然好像普通的常識，但是它的確是美國所以能繁榮的最大因素：　　增强工作效率，是提高勞工之工資；减低產品之價格；爭取銷貨市塲及使你有一更穩固的工作。美國提高工資的傳統方法，是以增强其生產力，這方法不但使工費因而提高，且能使人民之生活水凖也隨之提高。　　另一種提高工資的方法，是專靠提高產品之價格，然而由這種方法所增加之工資，對於勞工毫無益處，因為他所增得之工資，恰被所增之生活指數相抵消。（譯自三月份讀者文摘）本性難移  嚴敏求　　一個不務正業的瑛子，在外面流浪了幾個月，終於回到了家。　　他對妻子說：「親愛的，我又回到家裏來了。我很快樂：我們一家可以團團圓圓過年了。」　　妻子說：「是的，我希望你從今以後好好的做人，尤其　　我們的孩子做一個榜樣。」　　過了一會，妻子到樓下對兒子說；「你猜得到今天家裏來了什麼人嗎？」　　兒子說：「我猜一定是爸爸回來了。」　　妻子說：「咦！正給你猜中了。你怎麼知道的？」　　兒子說：「因為我搖搖我那隻撲滿，已聽不見裏面錢的聲音了。」危城記  秦瘦鷗　　提到太太兩偭字，徐紹明眞有些心胆俱寒，臉上的笑容立刻去了一半。　　「她早上柳州去了！」他硬着頭皮說，聲音有些發抖。　　屋子裏似乎有人想笑而竭力忍住了。　　「那到了柳州怎麽辦？」老祝也裝出了談虎色變的神氣

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The war in Shandong is fierce, and residents are fleeing. More than 10,000 people have arrived in Nanjing in recent days, lacking food and shelter, in a truly miserable state.

The following three measures were decided upon: (1) Requesting supplies from the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Executive Headquarters for emergency relief; (2) Arranging for the repatriation of refugees from recovered areas; (3) Sending refugees from areas not yet recovered by the National Army to Xuzhou to participate in the South Canal embankment restoration project for work relief.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting South of Yan'an</p>
<p>Communist Army Reinforcements Repelled After Attempted Advance</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Office, 18th] The Communist army has repeatedly reinforced its troops, massing on the southern front, attempting to advance on the National Army. Initially, there were seven brigades and four regiments, and an additional four brigades have been added. The total Communist army strength now exceeds 130,000. The center of the fighting is still intensely unfolding around Ganquan County and the area northeast of it.

<p>[Our Xi'an Office, 18th] On the morning of the 18th, the National Army advanced along the highway from Ganquan City, which was recaptured yesterday, across the last high ground south of Yan'an (i.e., Laoshan), and entered Yan'an County. By the afternoon, the main force had advanced to San Shilipu. Authoritative sources estimate that the final 13 kilometers to Yan'an County will be completed by the 19th, at the latest the 20th. At the same time, the National Army in the southeast crossed Songshuling and Chengjiacheng, entering the southeastern border of Fushi (i.e., Yan'an). As of now, the Communist army's resistance has not exceeded the National Army's prior estimates, and the most difficult terrain, advantageous to the defenders, is now behind the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] The Yan'an Communists have been broadcasting for days that they have decided to strengthen Yan'an's defenses with 100,000 troops and to seize Xi'an by taking it from the south with elite units, eliminating Hu Zongnan's forces. Contact first occurred in the area north of Luochuan on the 11th, with the National Army firmly holding its ground, facing frequent danger. On the 12th and 13th, National Army reinforcements arrived, driving back the Communist army and simultaneously advancing to the line from Niuwu Town to Linzhen Town in Jixian County. On the 15th, the Communist army massed heavy forces from Ganquan, continuing their southern advance and fiercely attacking Niuwu Town under cover of heavy artillery. The battle was unprecedentedly fierce. The National Army withdrew temporarily, and the Communist army took advantage of the situation, launching intense battles throughout the 16th. On the 17th, the National Army counterattacked Ganquan County from the southeast, west, and another unit crossed Ganquan, advancing into and out of Daxiaobaoshan, firmly defending the eastern line. On the 17th, the National Army was attacked by the Communist army south of Jinpenwan, suffering slight damage. When the main force bravely counterattacked, the Communist army was unable to withstand it and fled northwest. The National Army pursued, and by noon on the 18th, had advanced to Chengjiagou and was continuing to advance.</p>

<p>Zhangjiakou Conference on Stabilizing Suiyuan and Chahar Opens</p>
<p>It Is Reported That Chairman Fu Zuoyi Delivered a Speech Emphasizing National Defense in the North; More Than Sixty Proposals Discussed; Closed on the Same Day</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th] Chairman Fu Zuoyi stated in his speech at the work review conference for the stabilization area that Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan are as important to the northern defense line as the Northeast and Northwest. The northern defense line is truly the key to the safety of all of North China. Historically, any strong and prosperous dynasty owed its success to the stability of the northern defense line and invested the greatest talent and money in it. Today, we must not disregard it. As for the Inner Mongolia problem, those who do not understand the truth believe it is complex, but in reality, it is quite simple. I dare to say responsibly that the Inner Mongolian compatriots absolutely support the central government and absolutely oppose division. The people of Chahar and Suiyuan are indeed very poor, but the crux of the problem is not just poverty; it is like holding a golden bowl and begging for food. Chahar and Suiyuan are rich in resources, and if they can be developed, all problems can be easily solved. The conference opened at 8:00 AM on the 17th. Reports on various tasks were heard, and more than sixty proposals related to politics, finance, and economy were discussed in the afternoon. The conference closed at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Suiyuan Office specifically invited economic scholars, experts, and heads of relevant departments to hold an economic conference starting today to study concrete plans and implementation methods for developing economic construction in Chahar and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>The Suiyuan Political Supervision Group Returns to Beiping from Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Qiu Changwei Speaks on the Political Integrity of Chahar and Suiyuan</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 18th] The second group of the Suiyuan Political Supervision Group, led by Qiu Changwei, arrived in Beiping by car from Zhangjiakou at 6:00 PM. They plan to stay in Beiping for a few days to compile their report before returning to Nanjing, without going to Taiyuan. According to Qiu, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces are largely implementing the policies of relief, cooperation, agriculture, and land set by the Suiyuan Political Affairs Committee. Small loans have been widely distributed, greatly increasing social vitality, but spring plowing is still a problem due to the lack of livestock and manpower. Qiu also said that Chahar and Suiyuan provinces are in good order, with cooperation between the party, government, and military. Public officials are hardworking, and politics are clean. He concluded by saying that Chahar and Suiyuan are located on the front lines of national defense, and their land is rich in coal and iron. The people are particularly hardworking, and if cooperative farms can be effectively developed, adult education can be organized, and telecommunications and transportation can be strengthened, the future is limitless.</p>

Bai said in his speech that the Taiwan incident was incited by a small number of Communist elements and a small number of vagrants in Taiwan and that it has now largely stabilized. Some young people are still hiding in the mountains, and it is hoped that they will return soon and live in peace. The government has decided not to pursue them. Lin Xiantang then gave a speech saying that the unfortunate incident was caused by the past assimilation policy of the Japanese, which caused a small number of Taiwanese compatriots to develop a narrow island mentality, resulting in today's rash behavior. For these young people, their mistaken mentality should be corrected through education in the future. Chen Yi said in his speech that the childish actions of a small number of young people in Taiwan were due to the Japanese education's fear of losing and disdain for China, which became the source of the rash actions of a small number of Taiwanese compatriots today. I have adopted a lenient attitude in the past three broadcasts and have advised public officials from other provinces not to take retaliatory actions. I would like to reiterate my guarantee and take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the kind Taiwanese compatriots who rescued people from other provinces during this incident.</p>

<p>Hong Kong's Industry and Commerce Is Stagnant</p>
<p>Purchasing Power Declines, The Market Will Generally Decline, Goods Are Oversupplied, The Black Market Disappears Invisibly</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 17th] Hong Kong is now experiencing a decline in purchasing power. Responsible observers predict that if China's economic problems are not resolved, the market will inevitably decline generally by this summer. After the fear of devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar disappeared, the phenomenon of local goods has become a thing of the past. In general, people are unwilling to pay high prices for anything other than necessities. This is because consumption has reached saturation, but goods are still pouring in. After the Chinese government promulgated measures to restrict imports, Shanghai merchants' orders were unable to be imported, so they had to shift their targets and dump their goods in Hong Kong. At present, the black market in Hong Kong has invisibly disappeared due to oversupply and strict crackdowns by the authorities. Those who ordered goods from abroad six months ago lost a lot of money after the goods arrived. The market price of luxury goods is lower than the limited price. Now, a large number of goods arrive every other day. Merchants have no other way out but to cut prices and sell them locally. However, major grains are still rationed. At the same time, due to the increase in population, rents continue to rise. There are homeless people everywhere, and the number of unemployed people is also increasing day by day. The cost of living is about five to six times higher than before the war. Due to the difficulty in selling goods, the money supply is very tight and interest rates are high. The local industry cannot compete with foreign goods due to the high wages of skilled workers. For example, the selling price of foreign-made suits is cheaper than the local labor cost. This economic stagnation is definitely not something that the Hong Kong government can handle alone. Hong Kong's economy is closely linked to mainland China. Every economic or monetary fluctuation in China is not enough to shake Hong Kong's economy. Therefore, it is difficult to expect the situation in Hong Kong to improve until the situation in China returns to normal.</p>

Deputy Director Li, Division Chief Zhu, Section Chief Lu, and Section Chief Sun of the Education Bureau were invited to accompany them. Director Gu delivered a speech first, welcoming the new district heads to their posts and expressing his hope that they would work together to promote national education, which is the foundation of national construction. The percentage of school-age children enrolled in school in the city has reached an average of 80%, but some districts have only reached 40%, and there are more than 10 districts with less than 70%. Therefore, joint efforts are needed in the future to gradually reduce the number of out-of-school children. It is planned to add 500 classes to national schools this semester and 1,000 classes next semester. The recurrent expenses will be borne by the government, but it is hoped that the local authorities will be jointly responsible for the construction of school buildings and the provision of equipment. The "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign can compensate for this shortcoming. The director also reported that the principles for raising funds for public welfare undertakings such as education in various districts have been approved by the municipal government. The Ministry of Education has also issued eight points for attention in guiding the "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign, and each district can handle it in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education. Secretary-General Xiang then reported on the progress of the "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign in the city, explaining that the donation brochures have been printed by the Municipal Council and can be collected and used by each district when needed. Section Chief Li of the Civil Affairs Department hoped that the first thing that the new district heads would do after taking office is to handle the educational undertakings that are most beneficial to the people, concentrate their efforts, and resolve various difficulties such as school building construction fees to complete this meaningful work. From now on, the cultural divisions of each district must earnestly take responsibility to assist in the promotion of national education. Division Chief Zhu of the Education Bureau reported on the principles for increasing the number of national schools this semester, paying attention to the balanced development of each district. Districts in the city such as Putuo and Lao Zha do not have a municipal school, and it is hoped that municipal schools in districts such as Huangpu, Xincheng, and Lujia will also be established as soon as possible. It is also hoped that the old municipal schools with bases in districts such as Hunan will be restored as soon as possible. Section Chief Sun of the Social Education Division reported on the practical difficulties in promoting popular education, hoping that the new district heads can assist in resolving them. During the meeting, the Education Bureau distributed guidance books such as the promotion of national education and reference materials for school construction, totaling eight types, and specific methods for promoting literacy education. Director Gu reported on them one by one as a reference for implementation in each district and invited the district heads to express their opinions. District Head Zhong of Gaoqiao District asked whether the district office could report any areas in which the district's schools need to be improved to the Education Bureau for adoption and implementation. Director Gu expressed his acceptance. District Head Wang of Zhabei District suggested that in order to promote the "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign, it seems necessary to establish organizations for promoting school construction and celebrating longevity in each district in order to promote this work so that it can achieve satisfactory results. After exchanging opinions, it was decided that the Civil Affairs Department would formulate methods for donation receipts and notify each district to collect them from the Municipal Council.</p>

<p>Basketball Sideline Notes</p>
<p>The final good show of the basketball league Group A, Enkas first flourished and then declined, losing to the ever-victorious army Shantei team.</p>
<p>At the opening, Enkas frequently used mid-range shots, as if aided by God, nine out of ten shots hit, this opening show of force, had an impact on the Shantei team's combat psychology.</p>
<p>The most abnormal state was Chen Qingjiang, who did not score in the first half. Ge Peng Qigu Fu used his height to subdue He Lide's elasticity, but He was still the best performer for the Shantei team last night.</p>
<p>In the first half, Enkas threw in ten balls, and the Shantei team only put in five balls, the advantages and disadvantages of the situation can be seen. Enkas had many tall people, and the strength and speed were equal to the Shantei team, and the shooting was smooth, so they took all the advantages.</p>
<p>In the second half, at 24 to 16, Ji Nankang was sent off, and Lin Weicong entered as a substitute with illness. The Shantei team changed to offensive tactics and once made the score close and behind at 25 to 22, 31 to 24. At this time, the actions of both sides were rough, and the excitement was completely lost. The Shantei team only relied on He Lide to grab the ball under the basket to support the balance. Xiao Lin and V. Cairo Suki had a misunderstanding and were both judged to leave the court. Lin Zhiren entered as a substitute, Ma Zai. Qingjiang threw in the ball, and unexpectedly forced a tie, Qingjiang fined in, the Shantei team reversed and exceeded one point at 32 to 31.</p>
<p>At this time, there were still four minutes left, the situation was chaotic, and there were often three or five people piled up into one country. Enkas repeatedly fouled, Qingjiang made two free throws, and Zhiren made two throws, all of which hit, the Shantei team reversed the defeat in the last four minutes.</p>
<p>The victory of the Shantei team was mostly due to luck. When both sides were caught in a melee, Shantei Qingjiang had been injured and could not run. Fortunately, he relied on his calm mind and Lin Zhiren took the opportunity to score two goals. The last goal was a long shot, which was somewhat lucky. (Changnian)</p>
<p>The Stalemate in the Zhengda University Student Movement</p>
<p>The student movement at "Zhengda" has been going on for three weeks since the students took a collective leave of absence on February 20. Although Principal Xiao's head injury has healed, the Student School Protection Association still insists that they will not resume classes until the goal of Principal's Xiao's resignation is achieved. Cheng Chi-pao, a specialist from the Ministry of Education, came to Nanchang to mediate. The day before yesterday, he held the first hearing to listen to the opinions and reports of teachers, staff and students regarding the student movement. He put forward the instruction to restore order as soon as possible. The students' response was "no resumption of classes until the goal is achieved," so the Zhengda student movement is now at a standstill.</p>
<p>At the meeting with teachers and staff of Zhengda, Cheng conveyed Minister Zhu's three opinions on the student movement. He believed that Zhengda was congenitally deficient and acquired imbalances, and urgently needed to be replenished, and must not be subjected to cold strikes. The students' demands for "professors, books, instruments, factories, and farms" are all legitimate, and the government should do its best to find solutions. Cheng also emphasized that spiritual construction is more important than material construction. He advocated that universities should be like ancient academies, establishing an ethos that influences society and the country. The establishment of Zhengda has special significance, and in addition to knowledge transmission, attention should be paid to the cultivation of personality. Professors should pay attention to this to compensate for the deficiencies of the current guidance system.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang expressed particular concern about the Zhengda student movement. When Cheng came to Jiangxi from Beijing, he was instructed to "hope that Zhengda will quickly restore order and does not want it to get out of hand. If it really gets out of hand, he will never be tolerant." Cheng believes that in mediating this student movement, he should not pay too much attention to small things to avoid generating more complexities. Regarding the point of punishing the murderer for Principal Xiao's injury by students, he said: "At that time, it was late at night and the order was chaotic. It was inappropriate for the students to injure the principal with stones, which was an overstepping behavior. However, it is difficult to find the real murderer to punish now. At the same time, we cannot just identify the students who are participating in the school protection movement or the department representatives as the murderers who attacked the principal." He also stated that the school's order is stable, not because of procrastination, and the reasons for the student movement and how to avoid the same incidents in the future must be investigated and resolved.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Principal Xiao's resignation, Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongzi said: "It is unprecedented in national and world universities for a president of a national university to be injured by students, and it is also a major stain on Chinese university education. If it is not dealt with seriously, no one will dare to take up the post of president of Zhengda in the future, and no one will dare to take up the post of professor of Zhengda."</p>
<p>Regarding the student movement, a professor in the Department of Politics said: "It is a pity that the professors blame the students for taking a collective leave of absence and wasting their time. The School Affairs Committee issued a notice on the 22nd of last month to persuade the students to resume classes, but it was ineffective. Therefore, the resumption of classes in the future depends not on the professors but on the students. It is not permissible to injure the principal by students, and they should be punished." Professor Hu Guangting said: "Five professors informally convened representatives from each department to painstakingly persuade the students to resume classes, and the school also issued a notice, but there was no reply." Hu believes that suspending classes in this state for three weeks is different from taking a vacation. Professors feel as depressed as the students. The only hope is to maintain the school and make it thrive and have a bright future.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang, Director of the Department of Chemistry, was newly hired by Principal Xiao. He encountered this unfortunate incident only four days after arriving at the school. He said: "Zhengda has a shallow history, a poor research environment, and I am still new to Principal Xiao, but I heard that Zhengda has a strong research atmosphere and a good school spirit, so I accepted the job." His opinion on the student movement: "(1) Some of the students' demands are reasonable, and the professors also sympathize. (2) The students' methods are not correct. If they hope to achieve their goals by means of 'making trouble' and 'taking a collective leave of absence,' the professors will not come, and they will get less and less. He gave an example: Principal Xiao hired four professors in Shanghai at the same time. Two of them originally wanted to come to Jiangxi, but when they heard that there was a student movement, they decided not to come. (3) The Ministry of Education subsidizes schools based on the history of the school and the school's performance. Zhengda is congenitally deficient and acquired imbalances. If there is a small disturbance every three days and a large disturbance every five days, the school will be more and more unbalanced, and the more disturbances there are, the less opportunities there are to obtain subsidies. (4) Even if the principal is dissatisfied with the students, he cannot be beaten to the point of breaking his head and demand that the Ministry of Education replace him."</p>
<p>The representatives of the Student School Protection Association quoted Cheng Chi-pao's lecture: "Zhengda is congenitally deficient and acquired imbalances" infants, they likened Principal Xiao to a milkmaid without milk. How can a mother without milk be entrusted with the important task of nurturing an infant? They also compared Cheng to an experienced doctor who can see the truth and use scientific methods to replace the infant with a milkmaid with milk.</p>
<p>The 1414 young students of Zhengda took leave and suspended classes for the sake of "protecting the school," although it is for the future of Zhengda, but the real loss is still on the students. Therefore, Cheng Chi-pao's first prescription for the Zhengda student movement is to restore order. As of recently, this Cheng "doctor" is making a final effort on the "restoration of order" before performing surgery—executing the Ministry of Education's order to dissolve the student association.</p>

<p>From the World Games to the National Games By Wang Zhengjun</p>
<p>The world-renowned World Games will be held in London, England in August next year. International sports activities that have been suspended for nearly ten years due to the impact of the war will return to their pre-war state. Countries around the world are not only paying close attention to this major event, but are also actively preparing for various tasks to participate in the World Games in England next year, such as preparing to select athletes to attend the World Games, training athletes' skills, etc., all of which are being rapidly promoted under the enthusiastic advocacy of government authorities and the cooperation of sports experts from various countries. From this, we can know that countries around the world attach great importance to participating in the World Games next year.</p>
<p>Among the preparations that countries around the world are currently promoting to participate in the World Games, Sweden and the Soviet Union are the most enthusiastic. Sweden's sports are advanced, and it has already established a World Games training camp in the valley of Fanla Mountain in the Jämtland region of its country, selecting and concentrating the best track and field athletes in the country here, and then providing them with various skills training. Although the situation in the Soviet Union is not the same as Sweden, with the establishment of a World Games training camp, the various preparations for participating in the World Games are also being promoted at any time like a storm. The Soviet Union has adopted a competition method, and various sports activities competitions are being launched throughout the country, such as track and field, ball games, and boxing, all of which have been generally launched or are being held enthusiastically.</p>
<p>From the above, we can know that countries around the world not only attach universal importance to the World Games, but are also preparing for them with great enthusiasm. Now, let's look back at the situation in our own country.</p>
<p>Since the news that the World Games will be held in London next year was revealed, sports experts and organizations in charge of sports activities in our country have also paid close attention to this matter. The Ministry of Education also once planned to hold the National Games this year in preparation, and public opinion circles across the country also responded enthusiastically. Articles on the National Games are often published in newspapers, and the general opinions are the same, advocating that the National Games be held this year to select outstanding athletes to represent the country in the World Games next year. More importantly, it is to express the profound significance of national unity, peace and unity after victory.</p>
<p>However, the long-brewing National Games has not yet been concretely decided, and whether it can be held is still a question; the main reason is that the funds are huge, and the government is afraid that it will not be able to cope with it. However, the holding of this National Games is of great significance and has a great impact on the future sports undertakings, ethos, and psychology in our country. The author sincerely hopes that the holding of this National Games can be realized. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Fair, Reasonable, and as Open as Possible; The Principles for Reviewing Applications Were Decided by the Transportation Management Executive Committee Yesterday; Striving to Support Industry and Commerce to Cooperate with Economic Measures</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The position of Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee was recently concurrently assumed by Mr. Zhang Jia-ji, President of the Central Bank. Mr. Zhang has always been extremely concerned about the promotion of committee affairs. It is reported that immediately after taking office, he additionally hired industry and commerce magnates such as Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the National Industry and Commerce Association, Li, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, and Xu Ji-lian, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as consultants to the Executive Committee. The aim is to broadly consult and gather extensive benefits from various sectors. Yesterday (18th) at 5:00 PM, the 26th Executive Committee meeting was held at the Central Bank. In addition to the original members of the committee, Liu Gong-yun, Vice President of the Central Bank, Shao Zeng-hua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau, and representatives from various countries were invited to attend the meeting. During the meeting, Mr. Zhang first expressed his importance to the applications for importing accessories, supplementary parts, and machine tools in Appendix (1) Production Equipment Category. He believes that achieving the goal of reconstruction and development cannot be easily achieved without importing the aforementioned equipment. He has ordered his subordinates to expedite the handling. At present, cotton, a raw material urgently needed by various textile industries to maintain production, has also been carefully reviewed by specialized committees. Under the principle of reasonable supply and demand, the import of 23,000 bales was approved. Regarding the applications in Appendix (3), there are currently more than 6,000 pieces, with no fewer than hundreds of names. The competent department has also been ordered to expedite the review based on factual needs. In short, in the future, the review of any application must weigh the importance and urgency, and strive for fairness and reasonableness, and also be as open as possible in principle. Therefore, industry</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Yearnings -- Feng Li</p>
<p>Oh God, bring calamity upon me!</p>
<p>I killed an innocent lamb,</p>
<p>Friends of youth, curse me!</p>
<p>I destroyed a pure soul.</p>
<p>I joined D Company a week before its opening, while Jie Jin D Company joined the day before. When I first met Jie, I thought he was a happy young man with neat clothes and a smiling face. At that time, I didn't intend to get to know him.</p>
<p>We were all busy working for the company's upcoming opening. When I finished my work, I went to see Jie to get some fresh air. He still had so much work to do that I couldn't help but sympathize with him, so I casually said, "Still so much to write?" Jie replied, "Yes, I must finish writing it today." This was the beginning of our conversation.</p>
<p>For the company's opening, I was temporarily assigned to manage the microphone, and Jie was also assigned to work in the microphone room. After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the shopping mall was very lively. I wanted to see the grand occasion, but I couldn't leave the microphone. Jie was willing to take care of it for me for a while and let me go out to play. At that time, I wondered why someone as happy as him didn't like crowds. Later, I realized that he had his reasons.</p>
<p>The company provided dinner for the first three days of the opening. On the second night after dinner, Jie accompanied me home. The moon was full that night, and we walked slowly. When we reached my doorstep, I didn't dare to go in. I was afraid he would know my home. After we walked a considerable distance, I said "See you tomorrow!" and then turned around and walked away. Jie smiled, as if he understood my meaning, and left without looking back. I thought Jie was very cute.</p>
<p>One day, Jie wanted to invite me to see a movie. "When I thought about seeing a movie, I immediately thought about how unnatural it would be for Jie to sit next to me. So I replied to him: "Seeing a movie, what a difficult question to answer! Because I always go alone. Although I dare not refuse your kindness, I cannot accept your suggestion. I can only say thank you, I'm sorry. I sincerely hope that you don't lose the chance to have fun because of me." Therefore, Jie didn't go. I felt very sorry.</p>
<p>I like music, and Jie wanted to invite me to listen to music. He asked Mr. Liu, who sat next to him, to buy two tickets at the Lyceum Theatre when he went home. I asked Mr. Liu to buy only one ticket. Mr. Liu said he was unwilling to buy one because buying one could not compensate for the loss of the shoes. In the end, no tickets were bought. Again, I felt too sorry for Jie. He lost another chance to have fun because of me.</p>
<p>One day, I wrote a note to Jie, "I am very sorry, because I don't want to look for trouble, and I don't want to disappoint you. The world is so big, why did you choose me?"</p>
<p>Jie replied, "You are really smart, you guessed it. When I first met you, I had this idea. I felt that it was God's will, but I didn't dare to express it to you soon after we met. Now that you have explained it, let's not talk about that problem for the time being. If there is a possibility in the future, let's talk about it again."</p>
<p>I replied to him, "I hope you don't hope so. I can tell you that there is absolutely no possibility, because I like you, so I give you a hint in advance, so as not to disappoint you in the future."</p>
<p>After that, we always walked together when we got off work. We often detoured to the International Cemetery. Young people like cemeteries. We criticized one tomb after another. I said, "I would like to choose a piece of land here to sleep, would you come to worship me?" Jie said, "I'm sorry, I can't worship you, I have to go first!" We looked at each other.</p>
<p>The company also worked on Sunday afternoons and provided lunch. One day I was late and missed lunch. I met Jie, and Jie asked me, "Have you eaten?" I instinctively replied, "I haven't eaten, treat me!" Jie immediately replied, "Okay." I knew I said the wrong thing, I shouldn't have been so frank and given him the opportunity. I quickly said that I had eaten. He didn't believe me and insisted on treating me. He said, "You said you didn't eat, I'll treat you." I couldn't get through, and I was very regretful. When I got to the door of the dining room, I was still a little unwilling, but on the one hand, I was hungry. I thought this might be fate, so I didn't dare to violate God's will. In the dining room, Jie sat opposite me, smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee. I suddenly remembered a sentence from Plato, "A woman's ability to eat is ugly." I looked at Jie. Jie didn't look at me. He was really cute.</p>
<p>Jie has always been serving me. Once, my drawer was broken, and Jie lowered his head to repair it for me. His tie was caught by the drawer's wooden board, but he didn't know it. I said, "Look at your tie!" Jie took a look and said, "Oh dear," and he laughed himself. Therefore, I liked that tie very much—a red tie with white dots.</p>
<p>Jie had given me many things. I really felt ashamed to accept them. I said to him, "You have given me too many things. I am afraid that it will be a loss to you." He said, "I am satisfied that you can accept my things." Until Jie gave me the last thing, I was really scared. I didn't know that his feelings for me had unconsciously entered a dead end. It was really because I was too careless.</p>
<p>One day, Jie gave me a letter with a piece of jade attached. The letter said:</p>
<p>"...Now I give you something, it is my heart. Look at how meaningful the carvings on it are! Please don't disappoint me."</p>
<p>I quickly picked up the piece of jade and looked at it. A pair of mandarin ducks was carved on it. My hand trembled, and the piece of jade fell on the table. I panicked and tried to calm down. I slowly picked it up and looked at it carefully. Fortunately, it didn't break at all, otherwise I would definitely have to accept it.</p>
<p>I wrote back a letter. I said: "Trouble has finally arrived. The beautiful noun of friendship is deceptive, and human selfishness is an instinct. I am not a person for marriage. I love freedom. If you think that there is no friendship between men and women, then goodbye!"</p>
<p>I saw Jie in the company. He was dressed very nicely, in a white suit, wearing that red tie with white dots, and smiling. I was very happy, thinking that all the troubles were gone. This day was a stormy night. I woke up from a dream in the middle of the night. It was pitch black outside the window. Listening quietly to the violent wind and rain, I felt a nameless fear in my heart. I carefully searched for the cause of this fear, but I couldn't find any clue. I felt that there was nothing that could make me afraid. The next day, Jie didn't come. I asked Mr. Liu and learned that he was sick. He was in very good health, how could he get sick? Could it be that my letter made him angry? If so, I am really sorry for him.</p>
<p>The news of Jie's death finally came. I was very surprised. How could Jie die so quickly? At this time, Jie's letter also arrived. I felt very sad looking at his envelope. I quickly opened it. It was written on airmail stationery. When I unfolded the stationery, a photo fell out. I looked at his photo, and tears immediately welled up. In the blurry vision, I read his letter:</p>
<p>"Li:</p>
<p>You will no longer have troubles, because a young man who troubled you will definitely leave you and never meet you again.</p>
<p>I wish you eternal happiness!</p>
<p>Jie's last words</p>
<p>Month Date, 3 a.m."</p>
<p>Then I picked up the photo and turned it over. It said:</p>
<p>"He sacrificed because of his affection. You loved him when he was alive. Please keep him well after his death."</p>
<p>My Pen -- Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>I am tired. I lean my head, tilt my body, and lie diagonally against the headboard. My tired eyes look from the headboard, I see, on the table by the window, my pen is quietly placed.</p>
<p>My pen is already old. The black and shiny barrel has turned grayish-yellow. The copper pen clip has a green tinge. A corner of the wide pen cap has already broken. The smooth pen tip has been worn round and clumsy, and it is covered in rust.</p>
<p>But my pen is good. It is a faithful companion, and it has been with me for twelve years. Twelve years ago, I was still studying at school. One day a friend came to see me, telling me that he was going to France to work, and he didn't know when he would be able to come back. But he told me not to cry. He took a pen from his bag, put it in my hand, and said softly; "You must use this pen to write to me, forever and ever"!</p>
<p>I couldn't write to him "forever and ever," but I have kept this pen ever since.</p>
<p>I have kept this pen, and I have used it to write millions of words. When I am happy, I use it to express the joy in my heart. When I am in pain, I use it to vent the depression in my chest. When I am lonely, I use it to dispel loneliness. When I am sick, I get comfort from it. Finally, in the days of hunger and cold, relying on it, I was able to spend six of the most difficult years half-warm and half-fed!</p>
<p>During the difficult days, I became a cowardly coward, and my pen also became a cowardly coward with me. I knelt to hunger, begged for mercy from illness, and issued a humble tremor to the rumbling cannons and the raging fire. My pen, also in its anxious state, knelt to the cold, begged for mercy from poverty, and issued a humble tremor to the rumbling cannons and the raging fire.</p>
<p>My pen, countless times with me in the raging wind and rain, eagerly wanted to be a brave warrior, wanted to raise its head, straighten its body, and push its straight chest forward with big strides. But the cannons came, the fire came, and the cataclysmic tides surged in! I had no armor on my body, and no iron in my hands. In the end, I could only lower my head and sigh helplessly; my pen also lowered its head with me and sighed helplessly.</p>
<p>My pen has praised the bright flowers in the spring garden, and it has also mourned the stiff corpses on the frozen snow. My pen tip has entered the magnificent paradise, and it has also delved into the miserable hell. On a starless and moonless night, I imagined that my pen barrel could be like an all-powerful magic wand, and with a wave of my hand, scatter bright sparks all over the sky to illuminate the world. I also silently prayed under the red wine and green lights that my pen tip could be like a powerful giant bomb, and with a gentle fall, release a field of fire to burn all arrogance and hypocrisy. I have built a magnificent pavilion for my pen tip, and I have decorated the four corners of the pavilion with children's laughter and a loving mother's song. I have also dredged a wide river for my pen tip, and I have embellished the monotony of the river bank with the blood of brave men and the tears of heroes. I once wished that my pen barrel could become a hard sword, aiming at Satan's poisonous neck and slashing hard. I also once wished that my pen barrel could become a gentle flute, echoing the angel's silver flute, on a moonlit night that was like a painting....</p>
<p>My pen, dark and old, grayish-yellow; but it is a faithful companion, and it has been with me for twelve years!</p>
<p>My pen, small and weak; but it has given me life and hope, and awakened my soul for twelve years!</p>
<p>I am tired. Now I lie silently in bed, my pen is quietly placed on the table. But in a little while, when my energy is full, I will stand up from the bed and lift my pen with more powerful arms! (Sent from Songjiang in March of the 36th year)</p>
<p>Listening to the Waterfall Among the Pines -- Zhao Tongyin</p>
<p>Low Whispers -- Huang Zongjin</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, once, I was fast asleep on my mother's sewing table. When I woke up, the surroundings were so quiet that it seemed like there were only the two of us in this world. I said:</p>
<p>Mom, I also dreamed of flying.</p>
<p>Yes, you will fly one day.</p>
<p>At this moment, my mother shed tears, whispering about the sorrow of fate, one tear for each stitch, still mending my torn clothes. Then I felt a kind of terrible lonely pain and threw myself into my mother's arms, wailing.</p>
<p>After that, mother, I wandered in the north and south of the country with a lonely heart. Strangers and hypocrisy were always swirling around me...</p>
<p>However, I think I am still happy. I should be warmer than anyone else. Because that comrade in the green vest carrying the mailbag, there, across thousands of mountains and rivers, brought me my mother's warm words.</p>
<p>But, mother, now I am walking alone on the winter village road. The withered grass on the roadside mocks me, and countless prostrate tombs also open their stone doors, tempting me:</p>
<p>"Here is the door, come here and you will be warm."</p>
<p>At that time, I heard the peaceful snoring of the sleepers and the footsteps of the white clouds above my head...</p>
<p>Ah, mother, should the winter road be short? The end of the road should be woven with blooming flowers and lush grass, and the singing of larks, a warm spring of Liyang...</p>
<p>Last night, I dreamed that I was kneeling in front of the Virgin Mary. I, with holy hands, held them high, asking her to give me the seeds of ardent love, and asking her to give me a clear prophecy, saying that sowing in winter will sprout, bloom in spring...</p>
<p>Maria, Virgin Mary, lowered her shy head, as if the past surfaced in her heart again.</p>
<p>Alas, why can't I get my wish even in a dream? I cried, and my turbulent tears rowed the small boat of life to the shore of awakening...</p>
<p>Opening my drowsy eyes, I saw a golden star in the dark night sky outside the window, propping up the bright lamp of life. It, ah, loves the land so deeply, and thus has aroused my maternal warmth and remembrance.</p>
<p>Divination and Other -- Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Divination</p>
<p>Fate is a cunning snake,</p>
<p>When you try to catch it—</p>
<p>It slips away from your fingers like water.</p>
<p>Don't imagine that a "spade knight"</p>
<p>Will bring you good luck,</p>
<p>And a "queen of hearts"</p>
<p>Tells you of a happy love;</p>
<p>Because the composition of life is originally a string of coincidences</p>
<p>And thousands of seductive mazes,</p>
<p>There is laughter and tears,</p>
<p>But God has never arranged "absolute."</p>
<p>Pick the most beautiful flower!</p>
<p>Friends, because tomorrow—</p>
<p>It will wither forever from your heart.</p>
<p>Encounter Grass</p>
<p>Like a shooting star gliding across the sky,</p>
<p>The most unforgettable thing is your light smile;</p>
<p>The waltz rises like smoke from the accordion,</p>
<p>From your eyes</p>
<p>I realized the beauty of the daffodil.</p>
<p>Still remember the low cry before leaving?</p>
<p>Beside your temples,</p>
<p>Someone tremblingly inserted a carnation;</p>
<p>For fear that you have quietly wiped away the half-smile on your lips,</p>
<p>I am contemplating the forgotten verses.</p>
<p>Grave Worship -- Mo Zhi</p>
<p>On the second day of returning to my hometown, my elderly father urged me to go to the graveyard to worship the tombs of my ancestors. To show my filial piety as a returning wanderer, I readily agreed.</p>
<p>Although it was a short time away from home, the courtyard immediately presented a cold and quiet appearance. My old, white-haired mother stood alone at the gate, gazing at the desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>In the afterglow of the setting sun, the winter's end wilderness was particularly cold and desolate, and my heart was throbbing with sadness. My father walked silently, and I followed behind him in silence, holding money paper and sacrificial dishes. Although the shadows of childhood often floated up, my heart was always heavy. Stepping into the edge of the graveyard, three or five crows flew up from behind the tombs, croaking. This miserable crow's cry forced the hot tears floating in my heart to gush out.</p>
<p>I left home and passed through this cruel and long time. Several members of my family have passed away. A little sister died in a famine year, my eldest brother died under the strafing of enemy machine guns, and my third aunt died of old age. Ruthless time, famine, and enemies ended their lives; today, cups of loess cover their bodies, grief...</p>
<p>Seeing my grieving silence, my father hid aside as if to prevent more sadness from attacking, imagining himself completely immersed in the broken memories of the past. No, he was feeling the desolation of life!</p>
<p>I lit incense candles in front of my grandfather's grave, arranged the sacrificial dishes, knelt down reverently, and burned the money paper. When I kowtowed, the money paper was blown away by the wind, and I couldn't help but feel even more sad. After a moment of silence, I went to worship the graves of my aunt, elder brother, and little sister. At this time, my childhood life surged like a tide, and my soul seemed to be thrown into the dark and mysterious realm. My grandparents stroked my forehead with gentle hands, my aunt also stumbled over and came to ask about my well-being, my brother held my sister's hand, also as if welcoming me home...</p>
<p>"The most pitiful death was your sister," my father approached me, tears in his eyes. "When she was sick, she wanted to eat noodles, but it was a famine year. The family used leaves and elm bark to survive. Where were there noodles for her? For this matter, your mother ran around, but she couldn't get any. She could only deceive her with words: 'When your second brother comes home, he will bring them to you, wait a little longer...' In the coma before her death, she still asked: 'Has second brother come back?' Your mother just cried..."</p>
<p>My father sadly narrated, wiping away his tears with his trembling right hand.</p>
<p>"What about my elder brother?" I changed the topic to reduce my father's grief.</p>
<p>"His death seemed to be destined. Your sister-in-law was at her mother's house, and he had to go visit her. On the way, he was shot by a devil's machine gun, and he was already dead when he was carried home." My father sighed.</p>
<p>Recalling the two years before I left home, my elder brother and sister-in-law were as close as one person, and they often joined forces to oppose my mother. I thought that when my elder brother was lying stiff in the coffin, my sister-in-law's tears must have been more than anyone else's.</p>
<p>The pale yellow sunlight shone weakly from the depression in the western mountains, disappearing like an old man on his deathbed, breathing heavily. The graveyard had already darkened. I packed up the sacrificial dishes and followed behind my father's back to go home.</p>
<p>The evening wind howled, and the earth slept quietly.</p>
<p>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood -- 202 Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The above conflict of thoughts, one positive and one negative, in my heart, was only like lightning, flashing and becoming a thing of the past. Perhaps this point had already been seen through by the extremely alert Mr. W, so as soon as I stood up, preparing to look for his device, he reached out and opened a drawer of the desk in front of him, fiddled with it, and immediately a radio-like sound came out. As soon as I heard the clear and round voice, I knew it was Pingzi speaking:</p>
<p>"Brother, you're wrong, she's not trying to impersonate Kawashima Yoshiko to scare you."</p>
<p>It turned out that they intended to discuss the matter of the fake "Commander Jin."</p>
<p>"Not the person, then why? This is the voice of Jian."</p>
<p>Ping—Fang Shi this fellow has her consistent style. The few subordinates she selects and trains, as long as they are women, are considered her substitutes. So no matter where they go, as long as the other party doesn't recognize them, they will carry out the stinky card of "Fangzi."</p>
<p>Crane—What's the purpose, besides scaring people?</p>
<p>Ping—The first purpose is that she herself doesn't have to work outside, but the credit is readily available. Second, this kind of work is like holding life in the palm of your hand. If a subordinate is sacrificed, her name will add another layer of glory to her superiors. There is also a third point, she does this as a technique in her work, at least to make the other party confused, not knowing who the real Fangzi is...</p>
<p>Crane—That fellow probably doesn't know my background?</p>
<p>Ping—I think they are very clear.</p>
<p>Crane—Then why deliberately mess with me?</p>
<p>Ping—I think there are two points—</p>
<p>Crane—First point?</p>
<p>Ping—Deliberately messing with you, because Doihara will not let you go, although you also participated in the Black Dragon Society, it is because Konoe values you too much.</p>
<p>Crane—Ha... what's the second point?</p>
<p>Ping—The second point is even more dangerous; although I have not heard them—Matsui, Sakai, Imai, Fangzi, Fujio, these people—although I have not heard them say that you are associating with "suspicious people"...</p>
<p>Crane—What?... They are monitoring me?</p>
<p>Ping—Most likely... but it is not necessary to monitor, just ask you why you live here?</p>
<p>Crane—Hmph?... Why can't I live here? Aren't you here too?</p>
<p>Ping—I don't have to be afraid of them, because my mission is short-term, Brother, you can't say that!</p>
<p>L. Tolstoy's Quotations -- Translated by Jin Ning</p>

<p>Random Talks in Dubei -- Wang Cong</p>
<p>The Chinese people like to find a few historical heroes among people with the same surname as their ancestors. People with the surname Wen must claim to be descendants of Wen Tianxiang. In fact, Mr. Wenshan's bloodline has long been cut off.</p>
<p>Mr. Kong Er is obviously progressive in this concept. He said: "The ploughing ox with variegated hair, though it has horns, who would sacrifice to the mountains and rivers for it?”</p>
<p>Yu was the son of a whale, and Zhou was a descendant of Shang Tang; honor and disgrace rest only on oneself. This is not like being an official; there is nothing to rely on.</p>
<p>I oppose all people who climb up through reproductive relationships.</p>
<p>A desire for fame is not entirely a bad thing; it only depends on the attitude towards life and the path taken.</p>
<p>Qu Yuan said: "Old age is approaching, I fear that I will not establish a good name."</p>
<p>Kong Zhongni said: "The gentleman is grieved that he dies without a name worthy of him." Of course, it is the most beautiful and greatest work to create a brilliant rainbow for the sky of history.</p>
<p>As for killing people and then hypocritically laughing loudly to seek a good name; it is always heartbreaking.</p>
<p>As for the rainbow in the world, he cannot, and in fact does not need to, call out the sleeping ghosts behind the blinds to admire his own brilliance.</p>
<p>Kong Zhongni still has a good saying: "The gentleman is grieved that he is incompetent, not that others do not know him."</p>
<p>In the Literary Giant Film "Karmic Fate," the Newcomer Gay Madison Avoids Hiring Relatives -- Chang Kong</p>
<p>People have established a personnel system and achieved high work efficiency.</p>
<p>But we, the descendants of the five-thousand-year-old Chinese nation, have never been able to get rid of the "personal"-centered "family style." Whether it is an institution, a school, or a group, as long as there is such a "square seal" or a "strip stamp," you can always hear the "native language" of "one family" inside and out, from the doorman to the "internal affairs." As for their relationship, it goes without saying, wife's father, wife's uncle, wife's brother, nephew, niece, niece's husband, occupy the entire institution; messenger, document clerk, secretary, cashier, general affairs... which one is not a character taken out of "one's own" pocket?</p>
<p>Some people say: This is the microcosm of the Chinese officialdom. This statement still covers half the shame for the Chinese people; in fact, the Chinese nation does everything for "personal" and "family" consideration.</p>
<p>The Buddhist saying: "If one person becomes a Buddha, even his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." In the Chinese officialdom of past dynasties, it has become a common practice that as long as one member of a family rises to prominence, all five relatives and four clans flock to him, which makes the situation terrible!</p>
<p>Under the premise of cleaning up the political atmosphere, this kind of family-style politics should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>The transfer of a province, a county, an institution, or a leader often causes the entire organization to stop working for two or three months due to the entire transfer of personnel.</p>
<p>What kind of talk is this!</p>
<p>In the method of appointing civil servants decided by the Ministry of Personnel yesterday, there is a special regulation that the head of an agency should avoid employing spouses, blood relatives, and relatives by marriage; this is a "prescription" aimed at the current situation in China! I hope this bowl of yellow soup can save the incurable disease of familyization in Chinese institutions, and at the same time wash away the dirty "family style" of the Chinese officialdom and all institutionalized groups and schools!</p>

<p>Airplane Ticket Prices Have Risen -- Can Flight Safety Be Guaranteed? -- Gao Wuhong</p>
<p>Since Christmas Eve last year, Santa Claus has brought bad luck to airplanes. Airplane accidents have occurred one after another. Passengers have suffered "unexpected disasters," with deaths, injuries, cries shaking the sky, and the tragedy is unbearable to hear. Investigating responsibility, requesting compensation, accusations from the families of the victims, accusations from public opinion... after a period of uproar, there was no effect. From that time on, airplanes have really become a "crisis." A perfectly good airplane flies out and crashes, and people regard the shortcut of air routes as a dangerous road, avoiding it like a scorpion. If you don't want to be sent to the "Western Paradise" as soon as you take to the sky, you have to try flying with the "great fearless" spirit of "regarding death as home."</p>
<p>Now, although not long after, it can be regarded as "the matter has passed." The dead are dead, and the impression these events have left on people has gradually faded away. The China Central and China National Aviation Corporations, which had been suspended for many days, have been ordered to resume domestic flights on the morning of the 16th of this month. China National Aviation Corporation flew out 18 passenger and cargo planes, and China Central Aviation Corporation flew out 7 passenger and cargo planes. At the same time, the long-rumored increase in airplane ticket prices has also been received by the two companies on the day before the resumption of flights with an order from the Ministry of Communications: "Permission to increase by 150% or 200% at its discretion," and implemented at the same time as the resumption of flights.</p>
<p>This year's increase in state-owned transportation tools can be regarded as the first sound. Probably because the two companies have been suspended for many days, resulting in heavy losses, so they are "specially allowed to increase prices to make up for the losses." They can recoup some of the losses on the heads of passengers. The increase in airplane prices will naturally lead other trains and ships to "follow suit" soon. A friend of the author's wanted to go to Calcutta last winter. At first, airplanes kept crashing. It wasn't that he was timid, but his wife was worried. The trip was delayed again and again. Later, the airplanes were simply grounded. Recently, a letter came from that side urging him to go there once. He was preparing to take a plane when the route was restored. He heard that the ticket price had more than doubled, and he shouted "Hard injury"! The three losses in terms of time, career, and money are all impossible to calculate.</p>
<p>Although taking an airplane is dangerous, it is still the most convenient and fastest means of transportation, which can save a lot of trouble. People with business cannot avoid taking it because of the crisis; moreover, according to superstition, encountering this kind of thing is "destined," otherwise it would be as difficult as winning the lottery to "meet the opportunity."</p>
<p>Airplanes have resumed flights, and ticket prices have increased by 150% to 200%, but I don't know if the authorities of the two companies have also made substantial improvements to the safety guarantee for passengers. I hope that they can also provide passengers with 100% safety like the ticket prices, because people used to take airplanes as if they had entrusted their lives to the airline authorities, and their fate was left to fate.</p>
<p>The spring is bright, the sky is clear, and I wish that the flights of airplanes after the soaring ticket prices can be effectively guaranteed.</p>

<p>Note: The China National Aviation Corporation employs a British man as the pier manager, with a monthly salary of more than 100 pounds, an allowance of more than 2 million national currency, and gives him a house worth 12,000 US dollars to live in.</p>
<p>Saying of Lang Cao Duanfang—History of Extravagance and Corruption in the Late Qing Officialdom, Part Two -- Ai Ju</p>
<p>Enjoying gold, jade, brocade, and embroidery is greed. Even a fondness for calligraphy, painting, metalwork, and stone carvings is also greed.</p>
<p>In the Qing Dynasty, a saying went around about handsome men among the banner people: Da Rong Xiao Na Duan Lao Si. Na refers to the Chancellor Xuan, and Duan refers to the Governor-General of Zhili, Wuqiao. I forgot who Rong was. Na and Duan were both my colleagues in the History Compilation Hall. Na's father and my late father were born in the same year, Ji You, and Na was also my elder brother's classmate in the Yi You year. Duan was a Secretary in the Ministry of Works and was recommended by my late father as first-class in the Beijing Inspection. Therefore, Na and Duan were very familiar with me, and Duan even insisted on becoming sworn brothers with the three of us brothers. (My brothers disliked this bad habit the most, so Duan could only do it by force).</p>
<p>After Duan was dismissed as Governor-General of Zhili, he lived in Banmu Garden in Huangmi Hutong, only a wall away from me. At that time, I was an official in the Ministry of War. After the morning court, almost every day we visited each other, or if something prevented me from going on some days, he would send someone to invite me to appreciate calligraphy and painting together.</p>
<p>Now I will describe Duan's life, which can be divided into three eras. One was the era when he was a Secretary in the Ministry; the second was the era from being Circuit Intendant of Bachang to Governor-General of Hubei and Governor-General of Jiangnan; and the third was the era of being Governor-General of Zhili and his retirement and murder.</p>
<p>When he first showed his talent as a Secretary in the Ministry, my late father was the Minister of Works and greatly appreciated his talent, saying that he and Tie Bao Chen (Liang) were truly the two outstanding talents in the Ministry. Therefore, the two of them were promoted to first-class in the Beijing Inspection during my late father's tenure and were listed as his disciples. (Those who get first-class are usually called disciples). Wuqiao inherited the style of Bo Xi, the Grand Sacrificer, and admired elegance very much, especially liking to associate with deep people. Therefore, Zhang Zhengwen (Yun Ge) in the Jia Wu year and Kang Liang Shen (Meisou) in the Wu Xu year were all very close friends. Duan even claimed to be a Han Chinese with the surname Tao. At that time, he liked to collect newly unearthed steles the most, most of which were epitaphs, planting them all over the courtyard where he lived, as if in a mass burial; he often rubbed them and gave them to people, which was truly a first-class product. When he heard that someone had fine calligraphy and paintings, he would visit and ask to see them, and sometimes he would even secretly take them by trickery. After Bo Xi died, a small number of his collections also returned to his box. He liked to indulge in licentiousness. Koudai Hutong in the Western City was home to many impoverished banner people who were private prostitutes. Duan sometimes even went to their places in full official attire, which was ridiculous. During the Wu Ji year, the party members were killed, and Tang Liang fled. Duan then transformed himself into a singer of moralistic songs, printing them and sending them to friends (the content of the songs was to be loyal to the emperor and love the country, and to oppose the arguments of the Wu Xu party members). Through Li Lianying, he reached Empress Dowager Cixi. Cixi read it with great joy, and Duan was then recorded in the Beijing Inspection and appointed as Circuit Intendant of Bachang in Zhili. Can it not be said that he was extremely alert? (To be continued)</p>
<p>Lamenting the Two-Headed Monster Baby—I am Sad for Their Fate and Happy for Their Relief -- Wang Hou</p>
<p>The Yang surname monster baby, born with two bodies, died at the same time because the one on the left suddenly suffered from pneumonia, which affected the one on the right. They lived for about eight months. There is no definite conclusion on how long such a monster baby can live. I remember that there was once a pair in Siam, but they lived to adulthood. Then the Yang surname monster baby was a premature death, which is why it is sad.</p>
<p>God created Adam and Eve, both with clean and complete bodies, but the monster baby had a whimsical idea, with two bodies merged together, which has the suspicion of surpassing the craftsmanship of God, so its death may be a punishment from God.</p>
<p>After the monster baby was born, it was put on display. It is said that business was booming and the threshold was crowded, and the monster baby got sick because it couldn't stand the fatigue (reported like this), and died. But thinking about it the other way around, the number of people the monster baby faced in eight months was already quite a lot, or even more than the number of people some people see in their lifetime (especially since it has two pairs of eyes). The money it earned for its owner in eight months was even more than some people earn in their lifetime, so even though it only lived for eight months, it can be considered that it did not fail in this life and can rest in peace.</p>
<p>Moreover, at most, how long can such a monster baby live? One body, two souls (also two heads), I think if it really grows up to be an adult, the inconvenience felt in its body must be far less than the pain caused by the conflict of its two souls.</p>
<p>Superstitious people must say that this child committed sins in its previous life, so God gave it the pain of two heads. Humorous people would say that these are two children rushing to be reincarnated. God couldn't tell the first from the second for a while, so he could only let them both come out together (ordinary twins also have a sequence), which can be regarded as a punishment for their lack of humility.</p>
<p>In short, it is clearly one body, but it has to be forcibly divided into two, divided but not separated, which is really a kind of pain, a kind of divine punishment, a monster.</p>
<p>I am sad for the fate of the monster baby, and I am also happy for the monster baby's relief.</p>
<p>The Secret of Prosperity -- Translated by Jingchu</p>
<p>In its recent report to its members, the American Federation of Labor has the following effective and correct opinion. Although this opinion seems like ordinary common sense, it is indeed the biggest factor in the prosperity of the United States:</p>
<p>Increasing work efficiency is to increase the wages of workers; reduce the prices of products; win sales markets; and make you have a more stable job. The traditional method of increasing wages in the United States is to increase its productivity. This method not only makes the cost increase, but also makes the people's living standards increase accordingly.</p>
<h3>The Third Plenary Session Opens its Third General Assembly to Review the Gains and Losses of Diplomacy Over the Past Year; Lively Questioning and Tense Atmosphere in the Assembly Hall</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Second Plenary Session held its fourth general assembly on the morning of the 19th to continue its review of military affairs, politics, and the economy. Committee member Zou and Chairman Lu presided. Starting at 3:00 PM, the proposals were reviewed in groups, except for the diplomacy group, which was suspended. The remaining four groups held meetings in their original locations for review.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 18th] The Third Plenary Session convened its third general assembly on the morning of the 18th. 273 committee members were present.

<p>[Our Correspondent, Nantong, 18th] Bi Shuwen, commander of the 42nd Army Group who replaced Hao Pengju, came to Nantong yesterday to request instructions and left for Shanghai and then Nanjing on the morning of the 18th.</p>

<h3>The Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government Reportedly Reappears</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] According to information obtained by Mongolians in Beiping, an autonomous government has reappeared in eastern Mongolia, located in the Hailar area. However, in the early years, the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government was established, and later, under the instigation of Communist Yunze, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Joint Association was established to merge the east and west. The original Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government was changed to the Feng'an Provincial Government. After the CCP failed in Chahar and Rehe, the Xing'an Provincial Government has somehow changed into a form of autonomous government. Those who captured Kailu at the end of October were the joint forces of the Eastern Army and the Communist Army, totaling 65,000 troops. This is the first time the Eastern Mongolian Army has appeared on the domestic battlefield, so its significance is quite serious. The slogan of the Communist and Mongolian armies this time is to eliminate Li Shouxin's Rehe People's Self-Defense Army and block traffic to destroy spring plowing. Kailu was originally a protruding area of ​​the National Army's defense line, so only a small number of Li Shouxin and the 93rd Army of the National Army were stationed there. When the Communist and Mongolian armies suddenly rushed to attack the headquarters of the People's Self-Defense Army, Li disguised himself and broke through, barely escaping with his life.</p>
<h3>Dong Yingbin Flies to Beiping and Transfers to Shenyang; The US Attitude Towards the Dalian Issue Remains Unchanged and Still Hopes that the Soviet Union Will Immediately Return It to Our Country</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 18th] Dong Yingbin, who came to Nanjing to request instructions on the matter of taking over Dalian, completed his official business in Nanjing and left Nanjing by plane for Beiping and transferred to Shenyang on the morning of the 18th.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesman said that the United States had not yet received an official report to confirm that the Soviet Union intends to transfer Dalian to the Chinese government. The attitude currently held by the United States is still the same as that expressed in its note to the Soviet and Chinese governments on January 3. The United States still believes that the Soviet Union has no reason not to immediately return the port of Dalian to the Chinese authorities for management in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 14, 1945. It is hoped that the situation in Dalian will soon return to normal so that American citizens can go there to live and resume their activities.</p>
