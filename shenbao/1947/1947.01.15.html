<h3>政府要員在京集議　和平新案正草擬中　內容包括軍政兩項主題</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕政府方面參與和談之要員孫科，邵力子，獲治中，兪大維，陳立夫，雷震，張厲生，張羣，王世杰，吳鼎昌等十人，十四日下午四時假孫邸開會，至七時始散·會後據某氏談稱：自政府根據政協決議召開國大，制定憲法，並定本年十二月廿五日行憲後，此</p>
<p>一段期間，仍有要務多端待決，故決再邀共產黨同商國是。十四日之會議，即爲硏究和平方案，其內容的包括二事，軍事方面，根據整軍方案，求合理解決。政治方面，邀的共產然參加政府，並商地方政權問題之解決。至共產黨之兩點要求，則未予以考慮。此項會議或將繼續兩三日，一俟和平方案擬就，報告蔣主席核定後，即可向共產黨提出，至和談恢復之方式係圓桌會議或派員赴延安，則未有決定，胥視共產黨選擇接受何者而定。該氏表示，至盼共產黨以國家爲重，俾使和平之門得以重開。</p>
<p>本報南京十四日電〕政府方面人士，十四日午後舉行重要會議後，記者曾訪孫科，詢其對和談看法，據稱：政府方面正作「盡其在我」之努力，以求打開僵局，新方案正草擬中，惟尚未擬成。記者詢以是否包括過去八點，孫答：「過去的不談」．記者又詢以「中共兩點是否爲考慮對象」，孫不作肯定答覆。記者詢以直接談判抑舉行圓桌會議，孫答：「何者方便何者可能」。並表示：圓桌會議與政協不同，蓋前者並無的束力。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕孫院長談：目前唯一要務，端在恢復和平，而恢復和平又必須先恢復和談，和談之可能方式，一為直接談判，但直接談判在目前似難展開，故本人建議召開圓召開議，邀請各有關方面共同參加。至關於和談之內容，應以：（一）恢復交通，（二）實行整編爲主題。其他問題不難覓取解決途徑。孫氏旋追述過去一年來努力和平之經過，認爲良機一誤再誤，目今全國面臨嚴重危機，人民一致要求和平，認為對和平前途，應有充分信心及樂觀。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕張厲生部長稱：政府代表今日集會，曾就恢復和談辦法討論甚久，原則上已有決定，此項方案將來中共接受與吾，尚不得而知。關於改組政府問題，政府隨時準備改組，固不論在恢復和談之前後也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕雷震十四晨談：和談新方案，正由政府要員進行商討，過　所獲協議之整軍方案及未獲協議之恢復交通方案，均為重要參考材料。地方政權問題，為次新方案之主要問題，在若干方面，政府將在可能範圍，盡量讓步。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕聞滬地日內又將發生若干政治接見，孫科本人十六日可能再赴滬。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕恢復和談聲中，各方咸認中共之堅持兩項要求爲最大困難，，政府方面對之迄未加考慮。美方人士亦謂，該兩項要求乃和談之二閉門閂，首都關心國事人士，均盼中共再作考慮，勿以此兩項背離事實之要求爲前提，而致影響和談之恢復。</p>
<h3>地方政權及軍區問題　政府願合理讓步　傳中共亦不堅持兩前提</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨發言人孫寳毅昨對記者鄭重表示，民社黨對時局之基本主張，爲恢復和談必須以誠意進行，不應先作失敗之打算，即使和談不幸失敗時，必待政府先作各項重要改革，例如財政經濟政策之改進及結束訓政等，然後方能考慮參加政府，此項基本政策，現已得黨內一致之支持。論及政府行將提出之具體建議，孫氏謂：雷震在滬晤各黨代衣時，即表示政府願在地方政權及駐軍地區方面，作合理之讓步。頃聞南京傳來中共不再堅持兩項前提之消息，如屬確實，誠爲佳音。記者詢以張羣離滬時，希望民社黨提出對時局之方案，但最後朱提出，何故？答稱：原因有二，（一）完善之方案，需有相當時間徵求各方面之意見閉門造車，而致不切實際。（二）民社黨方案之草案，與靑年黨之意見頗有出入，尚需磋商斟酌，故未能即刻提出。</p>
<h3>孫寳毅將赴美</h3>
<p>又孫寳毅氏定二三月後赴美，整頓該黨在美之報紙，並謀海外黨務之開展，爲期的一年。據孫氏稱；該黨在舊金山之世界日報，將來擬增出英文版，以供年老僑胞之閱讀，氏並擬乘出國之便，在美硏究政治哲學。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕左舜生告記者，據渠個人觀察，和談之正式重開，目前尚有困難。現靑年黨在京並無正式代表，渠因參政會之故，短期內或將晋京，但與恢復和談事無關。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕接近美方之某權威人士語本報記者：華府不至再派任何軍事將領來華。魏德邁·李海之臆測，均屬無稽。司徒大使將繼續執行馬帥之未竣任務，努力恢復和談，促其成功。至和談再開之方式，凡有達到國共合作之目的之可能者，均將被採取試騐。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕休會將近兩月之立院，十四日九時半舉行三一二次會議，處理積壓案件，到立委五十餘人，孫院長主席，首討論國家銀行法立法原則，由財政委會委長陳長蘅說明審查經過，關於中央銀行法立法原則部份，陳指出，根據新草案，中央銀行爲銀行之銀行，受財部之監督，負輔助國家財政及調節全國金融之責，其資本全部由國庫撥給，如是可使央行成爲完全國家資本之「銀行之銀行」。同時，根據立法原則，央行發行幣劵之最高額，應經立法院之議決，其發行亦應由財部會同春計部檢查並公布。此外，原則中對央行不得兼營之業務亦有規定，此皆爲進步之點，所應討論者，則爲理監事究應由何種方法產生，蓋根據草案，全國銀行公會·農工·勞工及商業方面，皆得各推選二人爲理事，全國銀行公會並得推選二人爲監事，全國會計師公會亦得推出一監事，此點，各方頗多不同意，盼能加以討論。樓桐孫發言，認各方對銀行法極重視，如提新主張變更制度，對市面恐有不良影響，並希望討論此問題時，能時時憶及我人之工作係為未來金融制度樹立穩固基礎。孫院畏發言，對農工團體得推選國家銀行理監事一點，天不謂然，一再說明央行旣爲國家銀行，理監事自應由政府產生，今規定由人民團體推選，於法於理，皆所不合。蓋理事代表股東股權，有股權者始能推出理事，現央行之資本旣全由國庫撥給，不知案據何種理由，令上述團體得推出理事。孫並舉出英美銀行制度爲例，說明此種規定，即在外國亦所罕見，據稱：英倫銀行收歸國有獲，國家已爲該行股東理事，由政府派定之，其辦法爲財部提名後，由英王任命之，並無公會得推選理事之規定，是以國家銀行之理監事，無論如何，須由政府聘任，量多亦僅由團體提名，再由政府決定，不然國家銀行無異爲「全國各團體之公立銀行」，豈非笑話。樓桐孫再起發言，認立法原則中對中交農三行與央行之法律關係並無說明，似應列入。洪瑞釗主張，此案關係重大，不宜草率從事，應重付審查，並建議立法原則中應規定國家銀行之政策，應如何與國家之金融財政政策相配合，同時，對於國家銀行從事投機牟利等行爲，亦應加以制止。洪氏指出、今日之中央銀行，以投機商姿態於投機市面出現，以投機商手法從事打擊投機商人之工作，在黃金政策方面，處處以多頭架勢出現，與商人鬥法，令投機者進入其圈套，此種做法，即令勝利，亦不足爲訓，更不足爲榮，若不幸而失敗，請問置國家利益，人民生計於何地？因之，將來之國家銀行法，對此非予限制不可。</p>
<h3>收回小四行官股　亦決定重付審査</h3>
<p>張肇元對於我國目前銀行界不官不商，亦官亦商之情形，深表不滿，指出根據世界趨勢，國家銀行與商業銀行之劃分甚淸，一一者糾總後，流弊極大，目前國家銀行中所有之少數商殷，實在無繼續容其插足必要，張氏繼指出，小四行中官股數目雖有多寡，然因不官不商而產生之流弊，實應設法剔除，蓋小四行攙人官股後，與商業銀行發生種種不應有之爭端，而吃虧者又往往爲商行，因之，至張小四行中所有官股應全部退出，最後決定國家銀行法立法原則草案重付審查，收回小四行官股案亦重付審査。</p>
<p>今日立院討論銀行法問題外，尙通過兩重要法令，其一爲修正礦產稅條例草案，該案主要之點爲將煤炭，煤氣，石油，鐵等有關工業及國民日用品之物資之稅率，减低爲百分之三。另一要案爲修正經濟部商品檢騐局組織條例草案。</p>
<h3>及時放棄政爭　解除行憲困難　孫院長在立法院致詞</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕十四日午立院同人在院公宴孫院長，孫氏即席致辭，略謂：本院自由胡展堂先生成立以來，已十有八年，即本人來此亦已十四年，此在短促之人生中，實爲一寳貴之時間，當時同人之年在三四十餘歲者，今已四五六十矣。在此時間內，本院完成修訂憲草，茲亦經國民大會修正通過，吾人之所以放棄堅持五五憲草，實本容忍精神，尊重別人意旨，今憲法雖已頒布，而行憲尚有實際困難，所以政爭如果不及時予以放棄，恐明年應行憲之日，猶不能行憲。</p>

<h3>冷靜了的軍調部　成立週年紀念悄然渡過</h3>
<p>〔本報北平　訊〕軍調部成立一週紀念日，今天悄然的渡過，沒有集會，沒有儀式，甚至三委員連一句感想都沒有發表。政府委員鄭介民說：「他根本就忘記今天是成立週年了。」去年今日　氏蒞任伊始，曾對包圍的記者說，他坐飛機來，希望不久能坐火車回南京，一年以來，他已經數去南京，卻還沒有坐過一次平浦通車呢！共產黨委員葉劍英，今天一見記者便掛出免戰牌，第一句話也是最末一句話便是：「我今天一句話也不能說。」美方的老委員饒伯森，受不了磨折，老早老了，吉倫將軍只得來頂這份苦差使，他也是打定主義，作三緘其口的金人，預先叮囑司閻，記者要見吉倫將軍的，請與新聞處接治。在週年日裏執行部惟一值得注意的動態，是下午三點半左右，吉倫首訪鄭介民，談話約廿分鐘，接著葉劍英拜訪吉倫，談話約廿五分鐘辭出，葉說只是日常事務性質的談話，這些戰火　　，調處閒散的日子裏。三委員常常十天半月不見面，簡直難得碰一次頭。今天的軍調部，不　去年上半年了，門口的共產黨衛兵早已撤去，只　政府憲兵在無聊的徘徊　躅，去年發下的三環臂章，在年來風雨　殘裏，看去只是一個零了，樓梯過道雖然也人來人往，但都缺乏緊張與生氣，辦公室裏打字機的旋律也照得比從前緩慢低沉，院子裏從前　遍布全國小組通消息電台帳篷，早拆除得乾乾凈凈，幾行楊柳，去年春天的葉子都落光了，枯枝叉上連一點新的萌芽還看不到。別　這般蕭條冷落，軍調都每月僅吃飯　暖氣就化十億元以上，中國每個人都要給他　兩塊錢呢！軍調部的房東協和醫院　務長鮑溫，是個大好老，他並沒有爲無功的軍調部耽誤協和的復員發牢騷，他說美方爲中國和平盡了最大勞力，他歡迎軍調部在他們的醫院裏繼續爲中國和平而工作。</p>

<h3>市參議會休會之後</h3>
<p>上海市參議會第二次大會於六日開幕後，原定議事日程爲一星期，後因提案衆多不及討論完畢，乃決定將會期延長一天；伺時爲愼重審查三十六年度市府財政預算案起見，又決定暫時休會，至二月初旬再行召集大會討論，而在此休會期間，則將預算案提交財政。預決算暨法規三委員會負責審查。所以從昨天起，市參議會開完了第八次會議之後，暫時休會，其議程也就告一段落了。</p>
<p>市參鐵會是上海光復後所產生的民意機關，成立於去年八月間，曾開過一次大會，至今年一月六日始舉行第二次大會；檢討過去，第一次大會所通過的議案，市政府雖已在逐步施行中；但也未必能使參議會完全滿意。因此在第二次大會中，潘議長致開幕辭時也不得不說：「希望各位同仁，代表各方意見，一方面須顧到市民負担，一方面亦須體諒市府施政之因難，在此大會中完成代表應盡之責任。」參議員適居在市民與市府之間，不免要陷於左右爲難的困境。在這八天的會期內，我們會聽到會塲之內的鐵論紛紜；同時也曾看到會塲之外的紛擾情形，雖可目爲民主精神的表現；但亦足以證明今日上海局勢的困難，市政當局若不能高瞻遠矚，努力革新，則一時恐難產生良好的政績。</p>
<p>上海是我國第一個通商大埠，也是全國的文化中心，人口的衆多以及工商的繁盛，均在其他各市省之上，而且又爲中外觀瞻所繫，所以上海的市政亟待革新，實在刻不容緩、但是客觀的環境如何？幾使改革市政成爲不可能，上海自光榮收復以來，已及一年有半，但是受了國內降局的激盪，不僅未能達到繁榮上海的目標，而且連安定兩個字也談不上。試看因攤販問題曾引起一塲軒然大波；去年十二月間，因金鈔狂漲暴落，又引起金融風潮，今年本市各大廠商，因年終獎金問題，又相繼發生的工潮；此起彼伏，層楚不窮？其他再如民族工業的破產，物價問題，房荒問題，以及節省用電問題……無一不足以象工微本市民生的困難和社會的不安。但是這些問題，不能單單責備市政當局，更不是市參議會所能解決的；老實說，這一切的一切，還不是受了國內大局的影響所致嗎？</p>
<p>目下國內的大局，實在太凶險了；國內戰亂一日不停，則國內交通就一日無法恢復，貨物更不能流暢；不但生產建設無從着手，物價問題，更不能根本解決。影響所及，使上海成爲畸零的都市。一方面因爲人口的激增，消費浩大造成表面的繁榮；而在另一方面因爲受了大局的彩響，工商業均呈不景氣，失業人數有增無减，有職業的，也感到生活的艱難。因此表面繁榮和民生困苦，恰成爲上海的一個諷刺的對照。再加以上海市政，又是千頭萬緒，任何興革，都是「非錢莫辦」；而上海市民的經濟能力，實極有限，對於市府所提出的預算案，已成不勝負担。所以我們平心靜氣，分析一下目前上海的環境，對於過去的市政設施，固不願多所指摘，即使對於今後應興應革的事項，實在也不願多言。</p>
<p>這次市參議會對於警察，衛生，教育，社會，公用，工務，財政，以及地政，曾紛紛提出質問，頗多煩言，以代表市民的身份，實爲其應盡之職責，固未可厚非；但是我們認爲，這些都屬消極性質，僅能發洩人民心頭所鬱積的苦悶而已；而對於上海市政的革新，仍少推動的力量。我們認爲市參議會對於今後的市政，應該多提出些具有　設性的意見。其實今日上海四百萬市民，對於市政當局的要求，是非常單純的，一言以蔽之，乃在建設一個安定築榮的上海而已。但是在目前的環境之下，市府要能滿足人民的要求，而使其所期望的安定繁榮的上海得以實現，也有兩個先決的根本問題：</p>
<p>第一是如何樹立良好的社會鳳氣？人人都知道上海的社會風氣，奢麋荒淫，敗壞到極點。蔣主席對於上海市政的指示，　一再以此爲言。我們研究這種風氣的造成，實爲「租界時代」所造留下來的，決不能聽其存在於今日的上海社會。但是如何移風轉俗，使上海的社會面目一新呢？我們認爲應從市府獨立立良好的政風開始。市府所有的公務員，當不能一槪論，均稱之「無官不貪」，但確有一小部份的人，來到了這十里洋塲的上海之後，敵不了聲色的誘惑，就爲社會風氣所同化，而度其奢糜荒淫的生活，前任市長期內發生營私舞弊的案件，現已相繼暴露，實在是上海市政史最可恥的污點。所以我們希望現任市長，能本着「有則改之，無則勉之」的態度，接受我們的意見，轉移上海敗壤的社會風氣，應從市府樹立良好的政風開始。</p>
<p>第二是如何繁榮工商？這個問題固然是有關於我國民族工業興衰的問題，應屬於國家的經濟政策的團範以內。但是我們每遇到一個工商界的朋友，談及中國工商業之前途時，無不搖頭歎氣，一致認爲捐稅太重，不勝負担，使工商業無法振興。我們在報端閱及市長向參議會　提出的預算案，總額達三千三百萬萬元，市民平均每人須負担六萬元，不能不說我太重了。上海是中國工商業的中心，其興衰有關中國經濟的發展甚巨，我們不得不替工商界向市政當局大聲疾呼，要求减輕人民的負担，千萬要「竭澤而魚」，使工商業根本不能存在。至於市府在收入方面，應以棗實爲先，整理稅收，也可以增加收入的。此在支出方面，雖不能量入爲出，但亦應以緊縮爲第一義，目下市府的機構也不免太龐大了。</p>
<p>要之，市參議會現已休會，在八天丙所通過的議案，市政當局，應即切實實施，以表示上海的市政，已能眞正的民主化。吳市長旣然也知道；「民國三十六年將爲上海歷史上最困苦艱難的一年」。更應知任何興革以及一切實施，須以安定社會與繁榮工商爲重點。反之。與此二者關的市政，在此困難的一年，均應暫緩辦理。至於如此龐大的預算問題，參議會最　注意的還在人民的經濟能力，能否勝此負担！好在至今還沒有通過，尚在各小組委員會的審查之中，全上海四百萬的市民，對於參議會審查預算案，都抱着十二萬分的熱望，參議員能否眞正代表民意，這正是全體參議員听面臨的一大考騐！</p>

<p>第一個是浙江鎭海人，姓竺名詩偉，在時年的二十七八歲。他家戰前僑居上海法租界永安銜，抗戰後，投考入中央軍校十五期步科，本業後，分發至七十九軍工作，在卅二年冬季常德會戰中，於七九軍一九四師連長任內，傷專不治，途中殉國的，現葬於湖南大庸鄉間。</p>
<p>第二個是江蘇宜興人，姓唐名一鳴，在時年的五十三四歲，妻亡，僅一女兒在上海，淪陷時曾於浦東四灶浜小學任教，唐君戰前向於浙西孝豐安吉等地任教員及區公所文牘，該地淪隆時，遂加入七十九軍，歷任書記等職，在卅四年夏季任職中國陸軍總部第四集訓處第十總隊書記時，病故於桃源縣三陽港，現葬於該地。</p>
<p>上列竺唐二君，生前均爲筆者友好，且曾於七九軍同事多年，竺君且爲軍校前期同學，因二君戰時未能與家鄉通信連絡，遽而長逝，復以逾時日久，遠隔他鄉，家屬甚難獲悉，用敢彼露報章，冀滬上二君家屬親友，故舊知好，聞訊得悉，速作運柩請恤等後事，則本人心願已了，設竺唐二君泉下有知，當可暝目矣。程漢德通信處武昌金水閘本部</p>

<h3>交換對德奧兩國和約意見　四強外次會議揭幕　並將商定莫斯入會議議呈　釐定新疆界問題勢必引起重大爭執</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：四強外次今晨在倫敦開始討論對德國之和約，此次四外次會談，乃今年三月莫斯途外長會議之序幕，極堪注意。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〕四國外次會議今日開幕，法國代表　維爾·美國代表黑飛，英　代表斯特朗爵士·及蘇聯代表古賽夫將負責擬定對德和約，並草擬莫斯科四國外長會議之議　。對奧地利和約則將由英國代表胡特勛爵·美國代表克拉克將軍以及蘇聯代表古賽夫起草。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十四日電〕四國外長代表今日開會，討論德奧和約起草事宜，此項會議心須於本月廿五日結束，俾將各項成議提出三月間莫斯科外長會議審核。蘇聯要求如何雖不可知，但　國近來態度已趨和綏。各方咸信德奧和約應有輕重之別，奧國可立即准其總復獨立，惟對德和約必須苛刻，必使其引起第二次世大戰償付代價，賠價各國損失，並須防止其獨裁制死灰複燃。惟於懲處總國三身問題之外，如　　定其新邊界，則戰勝國之開利害不一，巴多爭執勢將成爲重大難關。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕四強外代表討論德奧問題之會議，定於今日下午三時在此開始舉行。（上海時間夜十一時）今日首行應決定者，即爲會議之是否公開。蓋開此之外長代表會議均屬秘密，惟至紐約外長會議，已有充分之消息向報界發表，故此次採取何種態度，自應於會初加以決定。今日之會議或不致即行擬定關於德國及奧國兩個別是會議之工作計劃，此項計劃當於個別會議中決定之。奧國問題會議亦並不如一般所想象者之簡易，其首先應決定考，即使爲准許南斯拉夫及奧地利兩國參加討論之程度，及瀋查南國對奧之要求。（南國前已向紐約外長會議提出照會，要未詳針奧國斯洛凡納人所居卡林西亞省劃歸南國），其次即爲決定奧境　軍區內何種德資金可移作賠款。此外尙有多瑙河奧國境內部份之通航問題，該問題可能再度引起西方國家與多瑙河沿岸諸國利益之衝突，蓋多瑙河諸國希望該河僅歸各該國控制，而西方國家希望該河成爲真正國際管制河流供各國通航之立塲，固至今猶無變更也。德國問題會議之主要任務，除審查各小國之意見外，即爲決定是否准許德國未來之政府簽字於德國和約之上，　森堡對德國之土地要求，預料將與法國起　衝突，盧森堡要求使其東部沿　爾及蘇爾兩河之疆界，向前伸展至多五公里半，此外並要求取得南部沿莫賽爾河之一小方土地，該一土地之一部份正在法國所稱之大薩爾區境內，故料法國對此項要求，必將表示反對。</p>
<h3>德奧希望　列席陳辭</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林十三日電〕四强討論德國問題之外長代表會議，已定明日在倫敦開始舉行，德政界及官方希望四強中至少有二強或三强將贊成准許德國專家列席陳述意見。彼等雖尚朱向盟國管制委會正式提出要求，但彼等宣稱，四强中已有二强對該問題已予注意。蘇軍總司令蘇柯洛夫斯基元帥在返莫斯科前，已曾與德方及盟方非正式談及此事。聞美政治代表墨飛贊成允許德專家列席陳述意見。英國雖未正式表示態度，但料其亦當採取與美蘇相同之態度。所成問題者，僅法國之態度耳。聞德國每一大政黨不久將向盟管會提出專家名單，以供批准，批准以後可由盟管會指示其活動之範圍。</p>
<p>〔路這社倫敦十三日電〕奧地利政府已正式請求四強，准其得以及早參加關於奧國未來之談判。奧政府之照會內指出奧國乃最先受希特勒侵略之國，此次關於奧國未來之討論，應以恢復希特勒所破壞之奧國爲目標，若不使奧國參加，顯然不能使其再生活。</p>
<h3>捷克要求　修改疆約</h3>
<p>丹麥表明對德和約立塲　〔法國新聞社普拉格十三日電〕捷克政府發表致四强之血忘錄，說明對德將來命運之意見後，衆信其要求將捷德兩國目前之分界綫移入德境之內，俾捷克可以控制原在德境內之波希米亞山坡。有謂備忘錄內尚提出對德國領土之其他要求，如波茨坦協定後波蘭所控制之拉蒂布爾。赫魯比斯格拉資等地，此說業經此間人士加以糾正，謂並非事實。捷克政府旣未在備忘錄內提及格拉資一地，因此衆人皆認爲捷克當係贊成德波兩國間目前在梅斯與沃德一帶之界錢。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社丹京十三日電〕此間人士談稱：四國在倫敦舉行外次會議，討論德國問題時，丹麥對此所持產塲，當與最近所致四強之備忘錄相同，即丹麥認爲韋瑪憲法所定民主權利之含意，未見充份，尚需保障德國人民之民權與個人自由，方屬合格。德國境內之少數非日耳曼民族，尤其是南斯萊來斯維格區之親丹麥人民，亦應獲得同樣保障。丹麥更主張施萊斯維格區之霍爾斯坦行政權，應屬自洽性質，並許當地人民有自決之權。此外，丹麥當要求將該區內數十萬外國難民遣送至別處。</p>
<h3>原子制問題　英將支持　美國主張</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十三日雷〕負責方面今日宣稱，美蘇兩國倘在安理會中攤牌，則英國將贊助美國，堅主原子能管制問題應先於普遍裁軍問題討論。蘇聯則主張普遍裁軍問題應立刻討論，反對原子能優先討論。美國認爲原子武器倘不先決定管制辦法，其他武器之管制即無從談起。各代表相信美蘇之根本爭執可望於安理會十五日會議中解決、同時安理會各代表審閱英國對阿爾巴尼亞之長篇申訴，指責阿爾巴尼亞在柯孚海峽埋置水雷，死傷英兵四十四名。該案可望在十七日以前提付討論。</p>
<h3>勃魯姆總理在倫敦　英法進行談判　兩國共同利益事件爲討論主題　英法關稅同盟說又起</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〕法總理勃魯姆與央首相艾德禮之談判，本日午前十時在唐甯街相邸舉行，英外相貝文。法駐英大使安奈斯均參加。午刻貝文招待便餐，午後在外相官邸繼續會議。會議明日繼續舉行，英政府明日午後將正式招待勃魯姆。勃魯姆總理僅可在倫敦勾留六十小時，英國方面深知其一俟法國總統選出之後，即將退出政界，此一機會若失諸交臂，則一時恐不能復得。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十三日電〕法總理勃魯姆聘間英國之日，法一經濟專家多人適在倫敦，其中一人即法外部經濟事務司長阿爾芬之助手巴拉都克。據消息靈通人士談稱，巴拉都克之訪英任務，乃與英政府討論减低關稅壁壘一事，並擬對去年十一月在此間參加貿易預備會議之十六國提出同樣之要求。按該一會議當時曾建議各參加國家在去年十二月卅一日前，可提出各項讓步事件，今巴拉都克即係與英商都代表討論此事，並與英經濟專員就四月間一日內瓦關稅會議之程序問題交換意見。猶憶法運輸部長莫希最近訪問英國時，曾謠傳英法將簽訂關稅協定之說，今勃魯姆抵英，此說又甚嚣塵上，但官方並未加以證實，惟兩國刻正進行經濟談判，則屬事實。又英法經濟專家將於十七日在巴黎舉行會議，以使英方獲悉法國計劃之詳情，然後進行發展英國生產工作之計劃，比事國會將於下月加以研究·</p>
<p>政治經濟互相關聯</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕唐甯街十號相邸今夜正式發表公報，謂法總理勃魯姆與英首相艾德禮太週舉行之談話，係以有關兩國共同利益之問題爲主題。倫敦法官方之聲明亦謂，關人所討論者爲有關兩國共同利益之問題。據本社外交記者稱，法總理此次來英，雖以煤觔問題爲主要動機，然據消息靈通方面人士指稱，事實上經濟問題殊難與政治問題脫離，故整個魯爾區之未來，均將乘便加以檢討。又據本社巴黎來電稱，法外部發言人謂，勃魯姆總理訪英，將與英首相討論英法復與計劃之調和及法國之煤觔尚題等。</p>
<p>兩國領袖交換函件</p>
<p>勃魯姆應，於週末決定赴英，常法遝輸部長莫赫於一月一日赴倫敦時，携有勃魯姆致艾德體之函，表示希望加緊英美經濟合作，並力言法國煤觔問題如經濟合作，惟在目前階段殊不能以更多煤觔供給法國，甚盼勃魯姆得至倫敦與英閣員直接一談。法發言繼謂，勃魯姆總理將及時趕回參加星期二下午之法總統選舉。</p>
<h3>聯大第一屆會議一週年　郭泰祺盛讚聯合國成就</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十三日電〕聯合國大會第一屆會議一週年紀念日，中國出席安全事會代表郭泰祺博士，特發表談話，對於聯合國機構之成就，稱道備至，並謂經濟社會理事會及託管理事會所當解決之經濟，社會，種族，以及領土等項問題，均極重大，去年中國雖在困苦與擾亂不安狀態之下，但仍能堅守聯合國機構之目的及原則，中國在此種環境之下，對於聯合國機購可謂已盡最大之貢獻矣。中國堅信對於上述各項問題，欲在政治上成立協議，當須採取遠大之步驟，國際合昨尤屬必要，吾人認爲對於世界各屬地尚未能自治之人民，務須改善其待遇，並承認其在經濟上及社會上所應享受之權利。果爾則對於國際解及世界和平，必大有裨益。聯合國大會之成就殊大，深以爲幸，其中最可重親者，厥爲聯合國大會全體一致通過關於着普遍管制及裁减軍備及軍隊之一項決議，如能再採取具體育有效之辦法，則世界即將步入無戰爭之時代，屆時各國之人力所有經濟資源，均將用於促進人類幸福，而不再用之於戰爭矣云。</p>

<h3>河內越軍反攻　華僑區安全至堪憂慮</h3>
<p>〔聯合社河内十四日電〕河內今日復起激戰，越盟軍猛攻本城華僑區週圖之法軍陣地，更以七五口徑野戰砲轟擊本城各區。法軍司令部稱：徒步進攻者，侮越人武裝青年團團員，共意顯在試探法軍陣地實力。越盟軍今日攻勢之烈，爲多日來所未見，且係同時進攻若千地點，有時結集百人，進攻一地。華僑區共有華僑萬人，已被越盟軍圍困，對於法方，已成困難問題。華僑區佔地的五百方碼，在羅琪河南岸長達一哩之杜美大橋即在該區越羅琪河通往河內飛機塲。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢十三日電〕官方頃發表公報稱，法軍在河內城郊西南部進行掃蕩戰，越盟軍隊倉卒撤退，遺棄屍體頗衆。在凉山一帶，越盟正規軍被迫退出巴甯區。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十三日電〕據甫自越南歸來之法國觀察家稱：最近城南華僑之被殺，係受日人之指使，並誣指華僑爲法方間諜以爲藉口。該人又曰越南大規模軍事行動之階段已成過去，以後將僅有掃蕩殘餘之行動云。</p>

<h3>勃魯姆政府將闡明　法對越態度</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十四日電〕可靠方面息，勃魯姆政府將於本星期三或四在新　統選出，現政府卸職以前之國人之末次會議中，提出決議案，確定法政府對越南局勢之態度，該一決議案將以去年春季及夏季法方與維明所訂之協定爲據。</p>
<h3>杜魯門馬歇爾　隔洋能話</h3>
<p>〔路透社華舟盛頓十三電〕杜魯門總統今日與在夏威夷之馬歇爾將軍以長途電話交談。白宮新聞秘書羅斯謂：兩人曾傾心而談，並以馬歇爾將軍何時抵達尚未決定，當於總統再與其交談後始能宣布。</p>
<h3>美國務院　機密檔案　供馬帥隨時參考</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕官方一人士今日透露：馬歇爾將軍本星期內就任國務卿時，將獲得一種秘密檔案，詳載美國對各大國現行外交政策之內容，指導其處理外交事務一。美國史上歷任國務卿獲得此種檔一茶者，以馬歇爾爲第一人。此種檔案性質甚爲機密，美國對積累基本政策均詳細闡明無遣，係由國務院曾同聯合參謀部根據各大使報告及非正式顧問旭著名大學教授等之意見，資時數月綜合成爲一種國策，對於馬氏急切準備參加三月間草期科外長會議，尤具特殊價值。蓋以馬帥雖已熟悉中國情形並爲世界軍略大家，但對於聯合國機構內，歐洲及其他地點戰後外交發展之詳細內慕，尚爲門外漢。此種綜合制之立國策初步準備，始於赫爾國務卿時代，然後由貝爾納斯時代竟其全功。貝氏突然辭職後，曾以羨慕之語氣告友人稱，深望當初就任國務卿時能有此種檔案，作爲外交折衝之南針云。</p>

<h3>倫敦工潮益嚴重　勞動界反對軍隊運輸主要食物</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦寸四日電〕倫敦碼頭工人決定罷工，直至軍隊退出市塲時爲止，以示對糧食挑夫及卡車夫罷工之同情。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〕倫教運輸工人罷工事中央工資處理局今因法理關係，展緩至廿一日再作決定，但雇主與工人仍在另覓途徑，力謀打開此僵局。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕英政府高級人員本日在此告本社記者稱，艾德禮首相於本月十日與反對用軍隊運輸主要食物供應之大臣三人發生爭論時，曾以辭職爲威脅。同時本日有其他工人一萬人參加一萬四千名卡車司機之罷工，作爲反對軍隊運輸主要食物之同情罷工。緊張之情勢於是益形嚴重。內閣中意見之分歧雖已减少，但迄今仍未獲得解決，而勞働界對艾德禮頒發是項命令之事機一致表示不滿，目將再度公開表示。地下鐵道，公共汽車，電車及其他司機曾公開討論彼等之不滿情緒，但迄今尚無參加罷工之正式行動。一千輛由軍隊駕駛之卡軍上均站有警察，食物市塲亦由警察加以保護，但並未發生騷擾。按卡車司機要求每週工作四十四小時，每年有不扣工資之假期二星期云。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕仳界各處於過去六星期中發生飛機失事案多起，因而殞命者達二百人，故關係當局已於今日宣布採取兩大行動，美參院委員會曾於今日召見美國民用航空局及各航空公司代表調查近來飛機連續失事之原因，同時非列賓遠東航空公司亦因「呂宋小小姐」號之失事宣布暫停中國航綫之飛行。</p>
<h3>闡明立塲　英緬雙方</h3>
<p>艾德禮允緬人自決開會詞，重申前言，允許「緬甸人民自決，在不列顧聯邦以內，或聯邦以外，均無不可」。緬甸首席代表盎山與代表巴申答詞，直捷要求緬甸完全獨立。盎山稱：〔緬甸人一致要求完全自主。吾人當然希望及早運用此種權利，同時並望來日運用法律及事實」。巴申稱：「除開完全獨立外，無法滿足緬人之願望」。會議將在文德禮主特下，繼續舉行。開會時雙方避免討論實置獨立細則。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦寸四日廣播：印度聖雄甘地繼續在孟加拉省東都回印衝突地區巡行，宣傳其非暴力主義。該處旣無鐵路，且道路極端惡劣，同行者有少數信徒及黑山羊四頭其隨從信徒每至一村落，必合唱讚美詩，各方對於甘地此行收穫若何，意見不一。擁護甘地之報紙謂渠此行予印度人以不少安慰，使和平善意重見於各衝突區域，但回教報紙則謂甘此行乃屬失敗。</p>
<p>〔合衆社喀爾巴拉十三日電〕甘地今晨七時三十分自倫却爾啓程，赤足徒步，於半小時內抵達喀爾巴拉，甘地因鞋底破裂，足趾出血，渠擬於六日之內，走徧東孟加拉諸村，向各界呼籲印回團結。</p>
<h3>蘇聯與阿富汗　交換協定文件</h3>
<p>〔中財社莫斯途十三日電〕聯與阿富汗兩國，昨日在喀布爾交換有關兩國邊境問題協定之批准文件按該協定係於去年六月在莫斯科所簽訂者。</p>
<h3>今年世界各地　將有糧食恐慌嗎？</h3>
<p>從整個世界的食糧出產說來，大量的小麥，貪糖，洋山芋和漁產正在積極增加供應中。今年米和植物油的產景將有增加，但是肉類，牛乳和乳酪以及其他動物油脂仍將如去年一般地缺乏。</p>
<p>根據各洲產麥區域的報告，今年各種穀類登塲的時候，其數量將超過戰爭時期中的任何一年。今年的總收穫量約爲五十九億美斗，從道一個數字看來，吃麵包的國家的前途是樂觀的。</p>
<p>食米生產依然不多</p>
<p>吃米的國家大都位置在亞洲。今年也可能預料有大量食米的出產，但是較之戰前，仍見遜色，約减少百分之　十，因爲亞洲的人口繁殖迅速，今年的榖類出產未必足以避免嚴重的飢荒。估計全世界米的總產量是六十九億美斗，比較去年的產量六十三億美斗固見進步，但是比較戰前產量七十四億美斗又不免瞠乎其後了。其結果將致中國人和印度人局部遭遇饑荒。</p>
<p>當前食糧問題　結的所在是歐洲和亞洲。在歐洲，小麥是主要的食糧，今年穀類的收穫將爲十二億美斗，比較去年十億三千萬美斗，也略見進步，但較諸戰前產量十六億二千萬美斗又减色不少了。</p>
<p>英國和西歐的　雨以及東歐亢旱都是使歐洲的產麥數量减少的原因。英國的小麥常在秋收時，因爲過多的雨水而被浸漲破裂。自然道些霉爛的穀子是只適宜於做畜牲飼料，是不能焙製麵包供人食用的。</p>
<p>歐洲東部和蘇聯的歐洲部份都是缺乏雨水，難以收穫大量米麥的地方。今年歐洲中部和東部，麥子，洋山芋，製糖的甜菜都不能超過戰前產量百分之七十。施肥的缺乏，政局的頭簸都是主要的原因。</p>
<p>中海盆地日光充足，糧食的出產將有良好的前途。希臘，義大利，西班牙和法屬北非都能有較去年更覺豐富的出產。榖類，食米，洋山芋，甜菜和橄欖油的產量可能從百分之五十五推進到戰前百分之八五歐洲最危殆的是德國西部和奧地利。氣候的惡劣和政治的紛擾及人人的缺乏都預告着今年糧食前途隊去年一股的黑暗。</p>
<p>亞　食米產額的增加抵不上出生率的　增，在過去五年之中，印度一地就多了二千五百萬的嗷待哺的饑民。</p>
<p>暹　，緬甸，法屬安南原是產米剝餘區，但是較之仗前額仍是望慶莫及。這一帶產量的减低，大部是受　日本佔領的影響以及工具的缺乏和政治的不安。</p>
<p>中國印度困難尤甚</p>
<p>中國和印度將繼續感受到飢餓的威脅。中國糧食問題的癥結在於政治不安定，南北相聯的鐵路幹綫不能暢達。因此南方和中部的人民都不能從北方獲到食糧，按照戰前的消費量，中國尚且缺乏五百四十萬噸食米。挽救中國的饑荒惟有進口食米和雜糧。</p>
<p>印度方面，去年十二月收穫前三個月中已經遭受到緊迫的缺乏。印度要渡過這次難關就必須進口榖類和减少配給。美國，巴西和其他國家將有食米供給印度，但是數量究屬有限。饑荒是難免的。</p>
<p>豐當的食糧將出產在西半球。</p>
<p>加拿大預料今年全部小麥可以收穫四億美斗，這個數字是自從一九四二年之後未嘗見到的，較之去年已超出百分之三十五。大量的穀類現在都是從農人的麥田裏直接經赫得森彎運輸到英國去，爲時僅一星期多。燕麥印大麥也將有豐富的出產。</p>
<p>美國將在今年產出十一億六千萬美斗的小麥，比較去年增加三千七百萬美斗·農業部估計今年倘若氣候適常，是可能達到這固數字的·去年爲了救濟歐亞兩洲的飢民，美國開啓了倉庫的貯麥，剩餘糧食之少，打破廿年來之記錄。今年預計增加到二億七千五百萬美斗，還可能剩餘大量的小麥存貯下來以備不時之需。</p>
<p>美國的動物油脂將較去年略爲减少。亟須增加入口，禁止出口傾銷。儲存量也極有限。雖然美國某區域內猪的繁殖可能增加，但較之去年，仍難以駕齊驅。</p>
<p>去年美國輪船業罷工，正當遠東飢荒劇烈，亟須美國進口食糧的時候，因此加重了東言諸國人民的饑餓和營養不良。</p>
<p>阿根廷榖類和小麥的出口都遠不及贊前的標準·惟有肉類的出口超過了一九四五年的數量。阿根廷的農村，今年播種較去年多百分之十，預測今年出口將有顯著的進步。</p>
<p>糧食配給仍將在許多國家施行，以减免糧食恐慌的加劇。英國和　聯都將繼續麵包的配給。</p>
<p>糧食管制仍將保持</p>
<p>國際糧食管制是仍舊賡續下去的。必須設法運輸大量食糧給最迫切需要的國家。糧食的生產和消費在現壯下的世界還不能聽其自然演變。但今年控制剩餘食糧來消弭糧荒並不像去年那船迫切了。</p>
<p>糧食恐慌的國家，例如中國和印度，還　要經濟上的協助。美國就得擔負起這個責任來。首被日本鐵蹄蹂躪過的區域都是繼續需要食糧進口的。</p>
<p>英國和幾個西歐國家因爲收穫欠佳也將需要糧食進口。英國人將减少日川品和原料的購買來瀰補糧食之不足。英國的國家預算將要增加，做爲食糧進口的準備。</p>
<p>世界航運方面仍有若干障礙存在着。雖然今年的收穫預計情形較佳，但是饑荒的災區距離豐收的區域却是很遙遠的。今年將需要更多的輪船載送糧食到世界各地。</p>
<p>麥粉將要充斥於世界各地不以麥粉爲主要食糧的國家的市塲中。印度人本來只知吃米的，但是現在却接受了麥粉，做爲代用的糧食。在墨西哥和巴西，吃米的工人現在已經嘗試着吃麥粉，他們都喜歡吃麵食了。</p>
<p>開墾新土解決糧荒</p>
<p>今年糧食的貯戰較之去年將有增加，不致再有像去年那般傾罄了倉庫去搶救飢荒的冒險措置了。</p>
<p>新的土壤仍須繼續開墾和耕耘。現在世界人口較戰前多百分之五至十左右。但是食糧的出產還不能達到戰前的數量。</p>
<p>但是今年不致有大規模的飢荒是可斷言的。雖然整個世界的人民都不能達到戰前所稱的「普通」食糧的標準，到了一九四八年糧食的豐足也許可以有希望了。（兪晶譯自「世界報告週刊」）</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十三日電〕農業部頃宣佈：聯總於二月份內將以縠牧八千五百噸運往中國，救濟難民。按美國縠物出口二月份共計四萬六千萬包，殆爲一九四六年至一九四七年中最高之數字，其分配如次：英國一萬九千噸，太平洋英國屬地四萬二千五百噸，印度六萬九千五百噸，德境英美佔領區三十萬一千噸，德境法軍佔領區三萬五千五百噸，日本一萬六千五百噸，朝鮮一萬六千五百噸，比利時荷蘭各三萬八千五百噸，瑞士二萬七千噸，奧地利三萬五千五百噸，希臘三萬噸，義大利二萬二千噸，波蘭入千五百噸（按此項穀物係指小麥等物而言，食米不計在內，聯總於一九四七年上半年，擬以食米二十四萬五千噸運往中國）。</p>

<h3>讀書問題　一塲爭辯　下學期私校學費　決定酌量增收　免費額照規定嚴格執行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前日參議會討論未有結果之下學期（三十五年度第二學期）私立中小學收費標準問題，昨日在大會繼續討論時，各參議員發言熱烈，情緒緊張，仍引起一塲激烈爭辯。結果決定小學收費收費標準之最高額為十三萬元，初中為十七萬元，高中為二十二萬元。（按上學期收費標準為小學八萬至十二萬，初中十二萬至十六萬，高中十六萬至二十萬，約加百分之十，而此次敎育局所擬提交大會討論之標準為小學十萬至十五萬，初中十五萬至廿萬，高中廿萬至廿五萬，較上學期加百分之二十五。）</p>
<p>討論時敎育局長登台對此次敎育局所擬收費標準，以數字解釋稱：戰前小學學費約八元至十二元以，十二元計算，乘六千倍生活指數，則如今學費應為七萬二千元。但戰前小學敎員待遇為廿元至四十元，以平均數三十元計算，乘上六千倍，祗十八萬一月。中學戰前學費為二十五至三十元，以三十元乘六千倍，應為十八萬。而中學敎員戰前之待遇為一百二十元至一百六十元，以一百元計算，乘六千倍，應為六十萬。請諸位與此次所擬之標準可作一比較。</p>
<p>反對者發言反對本學期增加學費者有姜懷素，黃炳權，費樹　，周濂澤等，理由為：敎職員之生活固應予以同情，但大多數家長之負担更應顧到。而加費後敎職員待遇未有提高，卻給校長發了財。而今學費已較戰前增萬倍左右，則敎職員之待遇亦應照此倍數增加。否則徒增少數人之利益。學校不比商店，究應以敎育為先，經費不足數，可由校董會貼補。即如顧局長所言戰前中學學費三十元，以今日生活指數六千倍計算，應為十八萬。但上學期在三千七百倍時已收二十萬，多收一半。如加上利息計算，本學期不但可不付，且可拿點回來。看近日報上為經濟自殺者有多少？上學期有子女學費而借債，而今年關緊急，這一筆學費，又如何能負担得起？我們是代表大多數民眾而來，不是祗代表少數人。而應請諸位多向門外看看！</p>
<p>贊成者贊成依敎育局所擬標準者，有奚玉書，鄧傅椿，陶廣川，傅曉??等，理由為私立學校全賴學生學費維持，此六月來，米紗金鈔，無一不漲，依生活指數言約已較上學期時漲起百分之五十，但所擬學費標準祗加百分之二十五。敎師生活受威脅，但學費不准調整，沒有理由。各人都有子弟，都希望能受到好敎育，但亦必需敎使職員生活安定後，敎學效率才能提高。今日吾人應鼓勵人去辦敎育，而萬不能使已在敎育崗位上者灰心離去。如言校董會可貼補經費，但校董會大多有名無實。在應參議員亦有担任校董者，請問拿出了多少經費？給那一學校？至言家長是一條牛，不勝負担。則敎員亦是一條牛，且不但要為自己子弟做牛，更要為敎育人家子弟而牛！陶參議員廣川更大聲疾呼稱：參加敎育工作已二十年，今耳目睹此種情形，表示灰心。</p>
<p>繼有多人提出折衷意見，朱文德主張小學維持上學期原額，中學則提高二萬。瞿鉞主張小學最高十萬，中學照敎局所擬最額為標準。王先青主張小學十萬高至十四萬，初中十四萬至十八萬，高中十八萬至廿二萬。</p>
<p>付表決最後淵議長擬付表決時，陸參議員蔭初忽又請求議長解釋參議會組織法第十三條（該條規定凡表決與本身利害有關之議案時，應退出議塲，如此則與敎育界有關之參議員皆不得參與表決）淵議長當表示本人並無解釋權。如依該條規定實行，則不論討論農法工商等案時，農會商會工會或律師皆不得參與表決，如有欠通之處，此條祗能請中央解釋。繼之乃就造成酌加及不加兩意見付表決，結果造成酌加者居多，而酌加各數額付表決，結果多數通過決定小學最高額不得過十三萬，初中不得過十七萬，高中不得過廿二萬。</p>
<p>免費額又經敎育部規定市參議會通過之私校必須有百分之二十免費額，百分之十半費額一點，各參議員紛紛發言：　稱上學期各私校多不遵照此規定辦理。淵議長對此表示意見稱：上學期私校收費標準與規定免費名額一點，市參議會皆予通過，今私立學校祗知照標準收費，而不照規定免費名額辦理，簡直是欺騙。幫擬請　育局澈查上學期各私立學校輸免費半費名額一事，如有不遵照規定辦理者，應由校董會撤換校長，否則解散校董會。顧局長當聲稱上學期各校輸免費學額平均佔百分之十五，其主要原因為上次參議會通過此案時，各校多已收費。收了費要呌他再吐出來是不容易。所以議長稱不照規定輸撤換校長一點，恐怕責任重大，全體要被撤換。此為上學期本人督察不力，甚為抱歉。淵議長乃將此提議改為去年私校輸免費名額情形，請敎育局澈底查明，報告本會。本年度則請敎育局預先通知各校，嚴格執行。否則校長撤換，校董會解散。全塲鼓掌通過。</p>
<h3>市參議會　今起休會　本年度市府預算　留待延會期討論</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕上次參議會議決戰撤之市立實騐，民眾學校及市立實騐戲劇學校一案，此次市長提請大會復議，以利民敎之推行。昨日討論該案時，費參議員樹聲主張准予續辦。大會熱烈鼓掌，經多數通過。</p>
<p>開會前市立實騐民眾學校學生到會請願，市立民眾學校亦有學生參加代為呼籲。大會討論提案時，羣集於樓上旁聽席，待依次討論至該案，傾耳　聽，全心關注，當付表決時，見多數參議員舉手贊成續辦，欣喜若狂，掌聲　動。散會時，列隊對出塲之參議員，揮旗擁護，歡呼不止，</p>
<p>另提請複議關於裁撤市立　　師範學校一案，因根據顧局長報告已將該校學生併入新陸師範，對於培植師資，並無妨碍。故大會通過不必複議。</p>

<h3>「呂宋小姐」慘案　可泣可歌一幕……　紅舞星捨身救友　李素蘭冤沉南海　羅熾豐卒傷重死於呂宋　周麗娟死裹逃生電報平安</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於「呂宋小姐」失事旅客中，曾因奮不顧身，救護同伴羅熾豐而不幸「下海」之馮英小姐，頃探悉渠之傎姓名為李素蘭，寗波人，年僅十九，為「大都會」舞廳一「紅星」。李出身花界，昔在羣玉芳榮華家自鋪房間，後一度　旗息鼓，赴京探親，此次重返歡塲，乃寄寓於新會樂里東四弄憶華家，尚為二月前事。李以久居書寓頗有倦意，乃改入「大都會」正式伴舞，不意下海不久，而今傎以「下海」聞。且其死也，為救生而犧牲，亦風塵中難得之人物也。</p>
<p>此次李乘機離滬，純因稔客之召，赴港小邂。　李之手帕交周麗娟（名單上化名周萍），原為舞海　友。周於「上海小姐」選舉舞后時，曾參加競選，為米高美舞應一紅星，平日兩人交邂廣聞，得識大孚公司董事長李澄漁。適大孚擬在港　設分行，乃相約偕行。同行者除李澄漁外，尚有該行負責人羅熾豐，及李之友人孫子青。（名單上誤為孫志清）。</p>
<p>「呂宋小姐」號初定十日??程，聞因氣候不佳，臨時延期。是時李素蘭為便利行旅起見，行前寄宿於周麗娟寓內。迨至翌晨六時半，「呂宋小姐」號決定??飛，李羅兩人，乃駕車至周寓，促同行。時兩婦尚在夢鄉，聞訊後，咸極興奮，乃草草粧妝後，趕往機塲。</p>
<p>回溯聖誕節中航機失事，其中有武丑張椿華者，曾因受傷療治於中山醫院，周麗娟曾往探視慰問。目睹當時慘象，深有戒心，故此次搭機，亦會加以考慮，而其家人亦會應加勸說，不以冒險為然。但周麗娟思及遠東航空公司，係為外人所辦，且機身為一DC4型之四引擎機，當以為絕對可靠，遂不顧一切，決定??程。不意飛離上海後，果又出事，實非當時始料所及也。</p>
<p>再說「呂宋小姐」飛出上海臨近香港??德機塲時，亦因濃霧障止，無法降落，遂續飛馬尼刺，不料行近呂宋附近海面，竟因引擎起火，而被迫墮海。當時周李兩女，曾首先獲救，已告平安無事，但因同行者羅熾豐在飛機迫降時，業已不幸受傷，無法爬入橡皮艇內，李以見死不救，心有不忍，乃奮勇重返機內，將羅搶救而出，不意是時海灣不斷侵襲，李女竟因此被浪濤吞沒，永淪「苦海」。是時飛機亦已沉沒，機內尚有五人，隨機沉淪，而李澄漁亦在焉！</p>
<p>至此，業經獲救之旅客，已達三十六人，目睹機身　為海浪所掩沒，而李素蘭之亭亭玉影，從此消失浪沫之中見者莫不哀憐！</p>
<p>羅雖獲救，唯在機中時已受重傷，呻吟於橡皮艇中，在海面漂泊達十餘小時，始經「戈登將軍」號輪前來營救。</p>
<p>抵馬尼刺後，受傷者即急送醫院醫治，羅熾豐終因重任流血過多，神志昏迷，形勢極為嚴重。延至昨晨二時許，卒不治身故。</p>
<h3>遠東公司航機　奉令一律停機</h3>

<h3>失蹤五從身份判明</h3>
<p>失蹤之郭　英，係廣東省團大代表，於港粵間經商，乃永安公司總經理郭琳爽族人。「呂宋小姐號」失事消息抵達此間後，「永安」方面首先致電本報，探詢郭代表消息，終不幸以失蹤聞，據悉，此次郭氏係過港返粵。</p>
<p>黃伯英氏係本埠益　搪資　主人，於工商實業界頗孚時　，乃國貨廠商之領袖。</p>
<p>又前述之李澄漁氏，為大孚貿易公司董事長，亦即雲南省前民政廳長李培炎氏之公子。</p>
<p>陳寗關係華僑興業公司協理，因公赴港。</p>
<p>另一失蹤之陳逸之，係　灣省貿易局香港辦事處總務組組長。陳與其同事郭君由　　經滬返港，原定本月六日同乘中航機飛港，臨時因交通部下令中央，中國航兩公司停航一星期，乃改　遠束航空公司七日機票。嗣因「呂宋小姐號」待修，延期至十日，後又延至十一日起飛「遠東」因該機甫經修理，將待客減至三十人，陳郭二人被派乘下班機，後有人退票，陳因有要公待理，乃獲登機。竟不幸罹難。</p>
<p>獲救旅客名單中之周德成，係戴志成之誤，戴為大華經建公司業務部經理。周綸係　綸之誤，　為該公司航務部經理。兩人係經香港赴澳大利亞，接收該公司之輪船，並代「紡建」採購羊毛</p>
<h3>不幸消息又一起　美航機汕頭墮毀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美國不定期某航空公司之C四六型第五八四號航機，由查斯特皮加普（ChesterPickcup）機師駕駛，於本月十一日自滬飛港，飛抵合灣海峽附近後，突告失蹤，十四日已於汕頭海灘發現，全機損毀。</p>
<p>上星期六，第五八四號機與該公司另一C四六型第五八六號機，於惡劣氣候下，同時自滬啓飛。第五八六號機亦曾因氣候惡劣，被迫於華南海岸沙灘降落，唯後又啓飛，安抵香港啓德機塲。</p>
<p>皮加普之飛機，毀於汕頭南卅　之海灘上。據悉，皮中普機師已徒步抵汕頭城內，另傅尚有三名飛行人員興渠同行，惟尚未能證實。</p>
<p>此兩機於龍華啓飛時，曾遭若干有經騐機師之勸阻。唯兩機之美國機師於機塲上空試飛四小時，認為滿盡。兩機於飛離龍華時，未經騐行，最初機塲方面仍認為渠等係於此間試飛。</p>
<p>此兩機於去年初，由中央航空公司租用，訂約三月，唯於尚未期滿前，即已停航，因引擎欠佳，耗油量過高。</p>
<p>美國航空公司於龍　機塲將該兩機修理後，乃於上星期六飛香港。</p>
<p>據傅其兩機本擬於飛抵香港後，裝配新引擎，再飛馬尼刺，橫渡太平洋至墨西哥。另有一說，此兩機係售與南洋美某航空公司者，唯皆未能證實。</p>

<h3>天賜麟兒　竟屬子虛</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有讀者署名「仇海」的給本報來了封信，說是去年在河塔廟側　毀的中航公司一一五號機中乘客，除去四歲幼孩王弟弟安然無恙外，另有襁褓嬰孩一名，適被彈出夾在樹枝之間，竟亦絲毫無傷，被附近鄉婦抱回扶養，該孩白嫩秀麗，鄉婦認為天賜麟兒。仇海先生說得　　繪影，記者昨天因此奉命再到河塔廟去調查一番。</p>
<p>究竟有沒有這麼一回事呢？記者從河勞動保護用品廟發然而返，在歸途上想起這一位署名「仇海」的先生，也許他本人倒真的是「中年無嗣」，一天到晚想「天賜麟兒」，想得腦袋發了昏，而近來飛機失事的消息又湊巧接二連三，他老先生因此就昏昏然的連想到河塔廟的樹椏樹上去了。天下「白嫩秀麗」的嬰孩有的是，不過河塔廟樹枝上的奇跡却祗是他冥想中的幻像罷了。</p>
<p>一一五號機的殘骸依舊擱在那裏，有十幾個工人正在拆卸零件，河塔廟被壓坍的部份也仍舊是瓦　一堆。記者又碰到了那位大難不死的孫校長以及附近露出驚奇眼光的質樸的鄉民。他們聽記者敘述這待證實的故事，都割開嘴笑了。有的說：「傎是笑話！」有的說：「我們宅上都是有子息的。」孫校長儼然是這一鄉的衆望所歸，他肯定的對我說：「絕對沒有這種事，這簡直是荒　好得一點賞錢。藏在家裏，人家會不曉得的嗎？」</p>
<p>我們在失笑中離開河塔廟，並替這位「再世為人」的孫校長在瓦　堆上照了一相，聊作此行收獲。達　毀機殘骸旁的那顆樹幹j中，枯枝正空空的迎風搖曳。</p>
<p>繪影繪聲來尺素　徒勞往返河河塔廟</p>

<h3>高劍沖李虎兩逆　高院更審同日宣判　刑期減少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳劍冲，曾任忠義救國軍第八支隊中隊長，軍統局上海區行動員，後爲敵　逮捕，變節附敵，充任僞警察所長，敵滬南憲兵（隊密探，將我兩路特別黨部委員兼書記長吳傑之行踨，報吿敵憲，致吳爲敵逮捕，前經高院判處有期徒刑八年，被吿不服上訴，經最高法院發還更審，業於九日審結，昨日高院宣判，吳劍冲通謀敵國，服務有關軍事機關，處有期徒刑三年，褫奪公權三年，財產除酌留家屬生活必需費外沒收。</p>

<h3>為保安隊班長　承認殺人</h3>
<p>（本報訊）曾任僞保安隊班長之張雪根，在敵偽時期，因分配稅款不均，將另一班長向應堂擊斃，經偽保安司令部逮捕押送僞地院監禁。勝利後高檢處以漢奸殺人罪提起公訴，昨在高院受審。被吿面負肌瘦，身穿灰色囚衣，褲管一爲灰色，一爲藍色，對殺人事承認不諱，惟對於殺人動機，則稱幷非因分配稅款不均，而係由於被吿勸誘向應堂參加忠義救國軍，向未應允，深恐與已不利，故下毒手，將向擊斃，攫得向之駁壳槍一枝逃匿。庭上繼訊爲何不參加忠救軍反而投入敵守備隊充當密探，被吿則支吾其詞。繼傳訊證人沈關連，沈稱被吿會用切菜刀對渠恐嚇，要兩枝步槍，結果素詐僞幣一萬元了事。最後被吿請求傳訊前忠救軍隊長馬德生作證。處諭改期再審，被吿還押。</p>

<h3>為取締棚戶　警民起衝突</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市工務局與警察局合組之取締棚戶巡邏隊，連日來分往各禁建區內巡視，遇有新建之棚戶，即令其拆除。彼等於昨日上午行經極司非而路三十弄時，警官張藹先即下車巡視，其他巡邏隊員則並未下車。詎張與棚戶忽生衝突，張藹先當塲受傷甚重，其他警士即爲排解，並將張車送華德路警察醫院治療。而棚戶居民竟焚香燃燭，稱有多人受傷流血，並於混亂中有二人失踪，要求瞥局立即釋放。警局交通科長陸俠聞訊後，趕往視察，並召集棚戶談話，表示若確有其事，則渠可担保立即釋放。惟據調查結果，江寗路警察分局已將肇事人等全部釋放，現警局正繼續調查眞相中。</p>
<h3>大赦令下十五日　再犯入獄第一人</h3>

<h3>美水手刀戳三輪車夫案　勞傑斯被起訴　如被害人傷重不治　起訴條文尙有變更</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總美籍漁船水手勞傑斯刀戳三輪車夫程榮芳案，旬日來地檢處正傳訊有關證人，及搜集各種資料。頃悉：檢察官對該案業已偵查終結，已於昨日提起公訴，起訴法條係依刑法傷害罪第二百七十七條後段，（傷害人之身號或健康，而致重傷者處三年以上十年以下有期徒刑，）因被害人程榮芳傷及肺部與膽囊，傷勢極爲嚴重，創傷縱能治愈，今後健康亦必大受影響，故檢察官認爲應照致人重傷罪起訴。若在審理過程中被害人因傷震不治，則當變更起訴條文。檢察官又稱：本案被吿勞傑斯左額角亦曾受輕傷一處，據其供稱係被程榮芳用鐵圈盤傷，然不能提供鐵圈或其他證明，不足憑信。又因被害人僅指兇手勞傑斯一人，且經調查，確無某他帮兇，故其他有關人等，皆不擬起訴。</p>
<h3>歐哈德局案審結　廿一被吿作最後爭辯　靜待十七日決定命運</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕納粹在華情報機關歐哈德局間諜案，經美軍法庭數月來不斷審訊，除沈克等六人業已宣吿無罪外，其餘二十一被吿，昨經庭上宣佈，定於十七日下午二時宣判。屆時即爲本案全部結束之期。所有被吿不論有罪無罪，一律均將遺返本國執行。</p>
<p>昨爲本案最後一庭，雙方唇槍舌劍，辯論至爲激烈。檢察官方面發言者爲奧康納上校與杜華少校，辯護律師方面發言者有江一平律師，普萊姆律師及勞佑中校</p>
<p>奧康納上校認爲被吿席上二十一人可視爲納粹德國之縮影，此一有組織之團號，於一九四一年起，即在中國從事秘密活動，德國投降以後，彼等認爲軸心同盟之日本在遠東仍可獲勝，因此間諜工作繼續不輟。彼等在華南之秘密電台，截取聯合國空軍情報，由此而受害之我方飛行員不計其數。彼等之北平支部，供給日方關於蘇聯在滿洲邊境並無駐兵之情報，由此而使日本敢於放膽行動。</p>
<p>杜華少校根據偵詢調查所得及歷次開庭證人之供述，指出歐哈德局所有被吿在德國投降以後繼續從事間諜工作，遠反戰爭法規，故爲戰犯實無疑義。</p>
<p>江一平律師爲前上海德新聞局長普開麥辯護，認爲並無證據足以證明普開麥在德國投降以後曾以軍事情報供給日方。</p>
<p>晋萊姆律師亦辯稱並無一件正確事實可使檢察官指被吿而言，「此爲汝與日方軍事合作之部份」，或「此爲汝所從事之軍事性活動。」故渠認爲渠之當事人弗爾克勒及海雪不能稱爲戰犯。</p>
<p>勞佑中校同樣以檢察官方面未能提出充份證據爲理由，認爲所控歐哈德局上海部份於德國投降後繼續工作一點，不能成立。</p>
<p>被吿之一，前上海德新聞局職員羅門，昨亦自行辯護，要求庭上判決無罪。渠承認曾印寫宣傳小册，但此種小册從未散發戰堪，故實際上並無予聯合國任何損失或禍害云。</p>
<p>辯論終結後，二十一名被吿黯然還押，以待本星期五決定藥等未來之命運。</p>
<h3>黃杰將軍訪問記　儒將風流身經百戰　大場吊熱淚雙行</h3>
<p>〔本報專訪訪〕素有儒將之稱的黃杰將軍（見圖本報記者攝）前兩天以中央訓練團敎育長的身份，特地抽暇到上海來主持該團上海分團的開學典禮。黃將軍自去年復員回到南京，一直忙着中訓團的職務，前天是他在勝利後，第一次來到上海。十年不遠，上海市民對於抗戰初起保衛大場陣地的黃木將軍是不陌生的，黃將軍這次到上海來，也帶着憑吊的意味。</p>
<p>黃將軍是黃埔軍校第一期畢業生中最露頭角的一個，翻開二十六年秋的舊報紙看，可以知道黃將軍在戰壕裏指揮作戰之餘，常常把自己的「隨興詩篇」帶給記者們去發表，這是意味着生死的火綫上特有的鎭定與勇敢，其副作用更足鼓勵士氣，安定人心。</p>
<p>黃將軍是湖南長沙人，普通國語中帶着濃重的湘音，記者昨天在一個酒會上，初决拜訪到他，一身灰綠色的長綢袍，陪襯着他那副淸秀紅潤的臉色，顯得十分文雅，如不　介紹，誰知這他就是身經百戰的黃杰將軍。他和記者談了很多關於軍官復員的間題，中央訓親　在戰時担負訓練黨政人員的工作，現在則是軍官復員訓練的機構，黃將軍從前年勝利時起，就開始肩負起這個艱巨的任務。軍人復員，回到平時的職業，在外國是沒有困難的，我國由於兵役制及國家財力間題，不能使此大批軍官退伍後就能得到相當的職業，但是政府鑒於他們戰時的功績，自然都要予以合理的安置，何况建國見需要大批人力的？據黃將軍的估計，戰後復員軍官是二十學人，其中逾齡傷病退役者三萬人，參加轉業考試及格者七萬人，金國師團管區挑選幹部三萬人，挑選預備軍官二萬二千人，撥往各省訓練者二萬六千人，其他志願赴東北服務或參加軍中新聞工作者萬餘人。</p>
<p>黃將軍當九一八時，任第二師師長在古北口與敵人作戰，八一三時任空稅警總團長及徐海警備司令，未久升任第八軍軍長調滬作戰，他率領的二萬多人，最後退出上海時，只剩五百餘人了。黃將軍這次到上海住了三天，兩天是在上海分團辦公，昨天上午特地到大場「古戰場」作憑吊，據他的秘書王履常說：黃將軍在大場部屬的墳墓前，留連徘徊，終至於滴下了他的「英雄淚」，他決定爲抗戰死亡的部屬們，在大場建立下百世不朽的紀念塔，這就是軍事敎育的意義，對於他的部屬，如對待子弟第一樣的愛護。</p>
<p>黃將軍頃以在滬公畢，定今晨乘車返京，參加中訓團之軍官總隊綻編會議。</p>
<h3>馬占山返東北任所　乘長城輪離滬赴津</h3>
<p>抗日名將現任東北保安副司令長官之馬</p>
<p>占山將軍，於週前來滬療疾，茲已痊愈，於昨晨七時在外灘黃浦碼頭登福民輪船公司長城輪首途赴津，轉返東北任所。昨晨至碼頭歡迎者，有本市各界代表及馬氏親友數百人，皆手持「歡送馬占山將軍」之旗熾，並放爆竹。馬氏衣藍袍，外御黑呢皮領大衣，精神煥發，於七是正抵碼頭，與歡送者一一握手話別，並語記者，希望和平統一早日實現。七時半長城號在爆竹聲中駛離碼頭。</p>
<h3>警察局加緊冬防　將召開保民大會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察局副局長兪叔平，昨在記者招待會席上表示：陰曆年關已近，在此工商凋敞之現况下，失業人數已見增加，同時地痞流氓，散丘遊勇，未能澈底肅淸，加之最近獲得大赦出獄之罪犯，仍徨徬街頭，無所適從，致本市治安，頗受影響。目前警局雖已動員各分局所有員警，及保安警察總隊，機動部隊，義警大隊，警訓所學員等全力担任警衛，惟尙望全市市民注意事先防範，並與警局隨時取得連繫，俾盜匪無機可乘。警局即日起並將召開各保保民大會，曉以防盜須知，並利用電台廣播及幻燈廣吿，廣爲宣傳。</p>
<h3>海園遷讓房屋案宣判　被吿應於二月內交還</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市高院檢察處戴榮鐸檢察官之堂姊戴芍如，控訴出口商李愼言等，要求遷讓房屋案，昨日宣判。判決主文：「被吿等應於二月內，自華山路海園二三七弄十一號房屋內分別遷讓，將房屋交還原吿，原告提供担保法幣二百萬元後，前項判決准予假執行。被吿等提供担保法幣六百萬元後，准予免爲假執行，訴訟費用由被吿分担。」</p>
<h3>司徒博牙醫師　地租金案　昨日判決　千倍給付</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕地主謝子賢所有林森中路馬當路轉角租於司徒博牙醫師之地產九分四厘三毫，戰前地租金每年五百六十元最近謝向地院控訴司徒博，要求依復員後辦理民事訴訟條例第二條，增加給付本年度租金法幣一百二十萬元一案，業經地院於本月九日審結，昨日下午二時宣判。判決主文稱：「被吿司徒博應付給原吿民國三十六年份地租金法幣五十六萬元，原吿其餘之訴駁回。訴訟費用除參加參用由參加人負祖外，其餘費用由被吿負担。」按地院曾判決戰前存款皆依一千倍償還爲標準，此案戰前原定地租金爲每年五百六十元，今判令增加給付爲五十六萬元，亦適爲一千借。</p>
<h3>碼頭工人請願　凶毆工會代表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊曆年關逼近，廠店勞資糾紛日必數起，昨日社會局內竟有因勞資糾紛發生之兇毆事件。綠有招商局第三碼頭失業工人代表陳嘉匯等昨向社局請願要求復工。時工會代表吳士發問話甫畢，陳嘉匯等五六人預伏社會局廣塲，乘吳外出之際，包圍兇毆。社會局以陳等軌外行動，當即函送　山路警察分局訊辦。</p>

<p>大東舞臺紅舞女胡萍，廿三歲，胡金抹，廿一歲，同住永善街十四號三層亭子間，房間雖小，裝璜精繳，房內裝有小火電表，每月用度達卅餘度，近因限制用電，以致光綫黑暗，於是胡等命一電燈匠將電綫接至總門，是以電火雖儘量燃點，但度數反大減，每月僅二三度，事為該屋二房東王黃氏查悉，於前晚九點時，闖入其房內察看小火表，始行發現偷竊電火之事，於是全體房客共九戶，羣起而攻之，雙方一言不合，互相　毆，後由警士趕來，一併帶入警局，先據吿發人等陳述前情，並稱，被吿房內燃點百支光燈泡，豈有兩星期僅用一度之理。詰之胡萍稱，該項電綫實係電燈匠修理，並非我等故意呌他偷接等語。局方又將電燈匠傳案訊問一過，將兩胡解送地檢處偵訊。</p>

<h3>各廠代表謁宋院長　調整麵粉價商決　並配售利朗粉六萬包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市福新·早豐·華豐·茂新·裕通等五大麵粉廠，曾以生產成本關係，生產量逐漸减少，致每日配售本市需用麵粉各業之一萬二千包麵粉，亦發生窒礙。昨日上午十一時許，吳市長特於市府，召見各廠代表，到榮毅仁。席德柄。卞筱卿·錢壽椿。吳禮門，及麵粉商業公會理事長顧竹年，常務理事張超等，惟討論調整議價，並未獲致結果。吳市長當伴同各廠代表，往謁宋院長，會談經過，當決定將本粉議價，調整爲每包二萬五千元，外洋利朗粉（七十磅）每包三萬七千元，至麵粉商業公會之配售價，連車力在內，本粉侮包二萬六千元，利朗粉每包三萬八千五百元，該項價格，決暫維持至本年一月底爲止。又在農曆年關以內，以本粉不敷分配，決由各廠先供給利朗粉六萬包，撥交麵粉商業公會配售云。</p>
<h3>農曆年關逼近　金融情況尙佳　各行均有盈餘　交換情形良好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅五年度本市各行莊結賬後，一般情形，尙稱良好，除年前倒閉者外，大的依其資本額之大小與存款之多少，贏餘四五千萬元至五萬萬元不等，目前一般金融情形，似無若何變動，各行莊當可安渡農歷年關云。</p>
<p>再據本市票據交換所消息：農曆年關雖已逼近，惟連日各行莊交換情形良好，並未有軋缺頭寸之事發生。至退票數量，亦未增加云。</p>
<h3>存款準備核減　央行已發還餘額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕各行莊存款準備金，原爲百分之十五與百分之二十，去年十二月份起，减爲百分之十與百分之十五，惟準備金一律改作現金。至剩餘之準備金數額，目前已由中央銀行發還云。</p>
<h3>銀行學會規定　劃一印鑑樣本</h3>
<p>銀行學會近以往來同業頻增，所送印鑑樣本格式辦法互有參差，保存核騐，均感不便，聞重慶漢口等地銀行，其同業印鑑樣本，已由各該地銀行公會統一辦法，茲悉：銀行學會迭接各同業函囑研究改良，以期劃一，特經詳細研究，擬具「劃一同業印鑑樣本辦法草案」一份，印鑑式樣四頁，送請銀行公會通函同業一致採用，以資劃一云。</p>
<h3>紡建照額配售　紗市一蹶不振</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，江河日下，緣紗市本已一蹶不振，加以昨晚紡建發表，所有申請購買之紗綫，不拘廠號，照額儘量配足，一般薄於資力者，無不貶價求脫，廿支紗一跌十萬，四十二支雙股，尤爲焦頭爛額，竟落卅五萬之巨。</p>
<h3>銀根緊迫　布價下挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開因結束期近，銀根緊迫，吐售者多，致細布一律下挫，五福細布曾喊十一萬元，三A彩球喊十萬零八千元，迨至收盤時，聞紡建停開細布，價乃轉上升一千元至二千五百元，結果較上日軋小五百元至一千元，惟五福細布因現貨不豐，比上日升二千五百元，各檔士林，尙形平定。</p>
<h3>人造絲再抵降　廠絲市況甚寂</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲又吿低降，因中信局配售昨已實行，黑市貶價，目是意中事。一二〇號旭字有光，上午開盤喊三百四十萬元，最大喊過四十四萬元，終以乏人顧問，回小做三十五萬元收盤，比上日跌落十七八萬元之譜。下午塲外又喊四十萬元賣出，但無成交，其餘半尖等貨俱乏做開，行情亦無喊出，廠經市况頗寂。絲號大都已軋好頭寸，不願脫手，需款而欲求售者，價均做小，昨市與上日無甚上下，綢貨與廠經情形相同，喊價與成交價大有出入，昨市塲內喊價較上日無甚差錯，人造絲價雖小，華錦縐價仍喊三千五百元。</p>
<h3>外幣流通問題　列國所無·亟應取締　金融界之意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國商聯會曾向取府建議，禁絕外幣在劉內流通，記者特以此事向金融界負責人叩詢，據中央銀行某要負稱：外幣在國內流通，原屬極不合理，世界上決無任何一獨立國家，明令准許外幣在國內流通者，故中國國內有外幣流通，實爲一不合理之事實。目前之問題，即在如何將此種事實，加以消滅，惟欲消減此種事實，亦非一紙命令所能生効，如僅用明令禁止，難免暗地流通，滋多流弊，故欲禁絕外幣流通，必須擬具一周密有効之辦法，以求一勞永逸。另據上海銀行某委員稱，禁絕外幣在國內流通，實爲一合理之建議，政府在原則上自應採納，惟其實施辦法，則難免發生困難，禁絕外幣流通，必須審愼其事，不可朝令暮改，我國人投機取巧。往往不可思議，亦須事光嚴防，目前我國富商巨賈在國外存款者，爲數極巨，而我國財政本身之情形，亦非常複雜，禁絕外幣流通，僅其小焉者也，</p>
<h3>碼圓肉回鬆</h3>
<p>石碼生晒圓肉，前以軋缺，曾步漲二三成，茲以海湘輪已有運到一批，又値大結束已迫，行胃不貪，價乃稍鬆，昨市號方開出十餘箱，回鬆百分之七弱。</p>
<h3>昨日金市平靜　債股亦鮮波動</h3>
<p>烚赤穩定　外幣平庸　烚赤昨尙平穩，徘徊殊定。晨開三七一萬有求開後先見三七三　高價，央行逢高有售，曾盤旋而降，不久三七〇萬大關，終吿不支，低價時在三六七萬左右，掙扎較久。十時後，央行以三六八萬之價，配給一四〇條，嗣後供給忽見呆滯，復現穩定，十一時後，再越出三七〇萬關，午刻站三七三萬左右。午後央行加嚴管制，是以欲漲無力，自三七二萬起，逐漸回低，且有紗業中人加以供售，是以臨收見疲，結果較前收回跌二萬五，飾金卅九萬四，暗息仍在一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣極爲平庸，美鈔黑市六五〇〇元至六六〇〇元，自晨迄午，始終在此價掙扎，幷無特殊變化，午後平定少變，仍在六五〇〇元至六六〇〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收毫無出入，港幣亦無榮辱，港匯仍報一二〇〇元至一二二〇元，印匯一四六〇元至一四八〇元，英匯一九二〇〇元至一儿四〇〇元，除印英兩匯外，僅港匯稍有成交。</p>
<p>公債盤旋</p>
<p>華股恍惚</p>
<p>公債昨仍不脫盤旋，三六〇室五〇三室有售散買尙殷，統丙晨開見昂升至二二〇〇元外，中途低價見二一二〇元，最後在二一五〇元左右徘徊，較前收計甲乙平平，統丙微挫二十元，統丁統戊各升五十元，成交的三百萬元。</p>
<p>華股昨多空短兵相接，塲外對敲大戶，全力撳售，而二二一號在場猛購大批現交永紗，市况混亂而微形恍惚。晨開各股見低少許，開後二三二號七六號八三號八七號四七號一八〇號咸進，升至七七三元，二二四號一五二號一四號一九八號八九號來賣而回低十餘元，二一九號四號一入六號一七二號二三二號來進，一五號一四五號則進現永紗，勤興由一九八號力購至漲停，盤旋而高，遞交升至七九〇元，現交七七七元，孰料此後，即趨肉搏階段，二三一號二一三號一五四號力售現永紗，二二四號二三一號亦賣遞永紗，塲內二一二號突來大量搜羅現永紗一百餘萬股，而塲外大戶力壓，現永紗見過七八五元高價後，終被壓低，良以塲外報低甚鉅也。午刻最爲虛疲，而以盤局結束，較前收計永紗，美亞，華豐，微穩，信和，新光升半成强，勤興漲一成，景福微挫，冷股中紡，火柴，景綸，微降外，餘均吿漲及升半成不等。遞交美亞，信和，新光，華豐微升，勤興漲一成，永紗徵降。午後三號未進，一五四號亦購現交，遞交見七八五元，現交七七〇元高個，一五六號一七三號來藝現永妙，一九八號一八五號一五二號不時脫售遞永妙，曾見七六二元低價，二二號一八六號二三一號三〇號有進，四號出後復進，會盤升至七七五元以上，一五二號八三號一九七號脫手，臨收複退入七七〇元以內，結果較前收計永紗，信和，景福，華豐，微升，美亞微降，新光升一成弱，動興漲一成，遞交永紗美亞，華豐微升，信和，新光升半成，勤興漲一成，冷股水泥，麗安，五和，內衣，中絲永公榮豐，統益均漲，火柴，木通平平，景綸，中紡，新亞，商務均跌，塲外各股，若大生續漲，餘稍回低。</p>
<p>外股昨稍穩健，惟各股起仆較爲飄忽，怡紗曾迫九千元關，較前收計美聯銅業升半成，業廣，航業，紙業平平，餘均微升。</p>
<h3>煙煤挺秀</h3>
<p>煤市白煤鴻基塊實銷尙活，焦作塊車站到貨較微，行市路升，烟煤開平二號　廠方股戶逢低頻吸，市價急遽回升，塊煤亦隨之喊高，煤球平價配售第一批五千噸，年內即將開始，現上海市煤球零售商聯合辦事處，共有登記會員一千二百單位，分甲乙丙丁四等，甲等計派七噸，乙等五噸又四分之一，丙等三等又二分之一，丁等一噸又四分之三云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕煤球評價會，前經議定自十五日開始配售，據悉因轉備時間匆促，恐今日上午僅可辦理各零售商繳款取貨手續，下午始可應市，購置煤球手續，仍爲前訂辦法，憑同戶口牌，每戶可向零售商（不限地區）購買一担，每担售價爲一萬一千元，再國華煤球廠各門市部，售煤球辦法，亦照各零售商同樣辦理。</p>

<h3>市面不景氣　四大公司　營業淸淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各大百貨公司，因營業淸淡與勞資糾紛等原因，頗感難於支持，去年年底，四大公司職工，除要求雙薪與獎金外，並要求每人借薪三十萬元，經勞資雙方再度磋商後，已決定發給借薪，惟數額則酌量减少。目前各大公司中，以永安公司之營業額爲最高，而每日營業亦僅八千餘萬元，其他各公司更遠較此數爲少，故不得不藉减價，贈品等招徠顧客。據十大百貨公司聯合辦事處負責人言，本市百貨公司現多靠存貨渡日，此實爲各大公司空前未有之困難時期。</p>
<h3>運輸業昨獲准　繼續免稅一年　已納稅款准予退還</h3>

<h3>川財政極度困窘　敎育將瀕總崩潰　專科及中學校長四十餘人聯名辭職</h3>
<p>〔本報成都航訊〕川省敎育在去今爾年川省財政極度困窘之下，將瀕總崩潰，去年川省敎育復員經費八億元，中央僅撥下四億五千萬元，而川財政廳復尅扣二億元，僅撥付二億五千萬元，以致若十學校無法復員，經費亦支絀萬分。敎廳長劉明掃為此，已向省府堅決辭職，現經鄧代主席，及川省參議會再四挽留中。又全川省立專科及中學校長楊佑之等四十餘人。已於日前聯名參請省府，以經費無着，無力推動敎育，請准全體辭職。川省敎育前途，實深令人殷憂。</p>

<h3>敎部工作人員　由美考察返國</h3>
<p>敎育部前年七月，曾派一部分工作人員赴美考察敎育，并於事前指定考察部門：科長許自誠，（敎育行政）；督學趙祥麟，（敎育政策）；督學黃龍先，（高等敎育）；國立十四中校長楊希麗，（中等敎育）：專員李超英，（師範敎育）；科長胡叔異，（小學敎育）；專員趙笙，（社會敎育）；委員溫麟，（訓育）；在美歷時年餘，考察至為周詳，除溫麟已乘飛機先行回國，黃龍先，李超英現仍在美繼續考察外，餘均於日前乘海和輪抵滬，聞刻正分別編製報告，　陳改進意見，呈部參考云。</p>
<h3>胡叔異返國　暢談考察經過</h3>
<p>敎育專家胡叔異氏，前奉敎育部令派赴英美考察敎育日昨由美返滬，上海市敎育局顧局長及敎育家新聞界人士，先後在國際飯店及三馬路腴飯店設筵歡宴。胡氏於今日乘夜車晉京，向敎部報告。昨向記者發表考察經過如下：此次奉命考察，　歷英，美，加各大都市，如英國之倫敦愛丁堡，利物浦，牛津，劍橋，北明罕，美國之華盛頓，紐約，支加哥，舊金山，密蘇利，加拿大之屋太驊，蒙脫利爾，託浪託等地，參觀大中學各級學校及其他敎育機關約三百餘所，搜集敎育應用實際材料，極為　當。復因從事新聞事業多年，故又參觀倫敦之泰晤士報，紐約之紐約時報，每日新聞等報館，及合衆社路透社，美聯社等通訊社。美國務院情報局曾邀余向上海區廣播遊美觀感，並出席各學術團體年會。</p>
<p>……大學敎育……</p>
<p>英國之牛津大學，與劍橋大學，是英國最優秀之學府，同時亦為訓練「英國紳士」無獨有偶之最高機關，此二大學，均有二十個以上之學院，在牛津和劍橋二地，形成大學城，清靜古樸，確是青年藏修息遊之佳地。倫敦大學，是英國新穎之大學，建築設備之現代化，學系及學生之多，極如美國新式之大學。英國聞名之中學，為伊敦，及哈羅二中學，與牛津劍橋成一系統，可謂「英國紳士」之初級訓練機關。</p>
<p>……初等敎育……</p>
<p>英國之初等敎育，　得最切實，最有成效，英國人之好體格，好習慣，都由小學養成，最近將學齡前期敎育，規定在正式學制內，自二歲起，即受獨立一貫之　本訓練敎育，全國普遍實行，沈着老練之英國帝國，在歷次大戰中之表演，謂為小學　本訓練之成功。美國之中小學敎育，充分表演自由活潑精神，服務與助人以及國體生活之訓練，是中小學敎育之成功。師資訓練之師範學校，英美均極重視，一面培養未來師資，一面領導現任敎師之進修，所以輔導，是英美師範學校極重要之責任。</p>
<p>……女子敎育……</p>
<p>英美之女子敎育，或注重家事訓練，與兒童敎育二大項，與我國良母之敎育宗旨，十分相似，值得注意。英美中小學敎員之薪給，已十分近似，在美國敎育界，全國已有共同一致之要求，中小敎員待遇一律。至年功加俸，及各種優良待遇辦法，英美均已次第實施。</p>
<p>……成人敎育……</p>
<p>英美均主張「終身學習」（Life　Long　Learning）所以成人補習敎育，十分發達，無綸鄉村與都市，把學校開放，日夜供給市民應用，學習之年齡與時期，一面延長高等敎育，提高敎育之素質，一面提高學習時間，把學齡前期的敎育，納入正式學制內，加強基礎的國民敎育。父母與子女，同時學敎育於一個學校，分別不過在學習時前，與內容之不同，在英美已司空見慣。學校社會化，將學校當作改進社會之中心機關，在英國有幾個實騐區，呌做（ConniunitrCenters）卓著成績，值得效法。</p>

<h3>昨晚籃球聯賽　後來居上喜出望外　汕隊壓倒海陸青　另塲華陽輕取鐵路滬</h3>
<p>二屆籃球聯賽，昨日下午六時半起，甲組兩幕，廣績在市體育館舉行，觀衆不多，戰來頗為精彩。結果甲二部華陽對鐵路滬之戰，華陽以五十九比卅六勝鐵路滬，甲一部汕隊對海陸青之役，汕隊以四十比卅七反敗勝海陸青。戰情如下：</p>
<p>開塲戲首塲甲二部華陽對鐵路滬登塲，鐵路諸將攻守無方，且手法不佳，獨腳上功夫頗多，致使華陽諸　先生，多與球同做地下滾。華陽各將善遠射，穿心籃源源而中。開賽後華陽季有崑籃下托入，首開紀錄，孫銘新錦上添花，以四比零領前。鐵路陳恩榮遠射獲分後，華陽孫銘新又告探中，時宋啓後離塲，王華庭入補，鐵路聯絡欠熟，華陽着着進逼，獲分累累，鐵路吳炳浩韓龍海李垚等，竭力掙扎，上半時終了，華陽以廿二比十五優先。</p>

<h3>HVA工程計劃副的助產師　黃河頸問车陝西</h3>
<p>— 西安四日航訊　本報西安記者李馳</p>
<p>新年本該放三日假，但元旦那天，依然有二十多位中美籍水利專家在陝省水利局開着座談會，熱烈地彼此交換意見。出席者包括馳名天下的薩凡奇老博士，和最高經濟委員會黃河顧問團一行其她十二人，他們好像忘記了這天應該休息，因而照常集中精力來研討流經九省的浩浩黃水，和關乎要澈底治療「黃患」而不能忽略的汾·洛·涇·渭四河的「診斷」與「處方」。本雀水利常局提供了厚厚的一册一册資料，無數頁地同，統計。</p>
<p>座談會才開過了，「黃顧團」一行十三人趕程到機塲，乘坐專機飛汴返京，其間沒有片刻的空閒。他們在陝前後一共勾留十八天，跑了一千多公里早路，和完成了好幾百公里的空中測量，但並未發表最後的結論。</p>
<p>黃河中游</p>
<p>話從上月十三日該團自汴飛寗夏說起：當天專機沿着黃河床往西飛，到了潼關，折北飛，跟着山西陝西交界的黃河水道，在著名的龍門和壺口一帶作低空測量，然後繼續往北飛，越過河曲的附近上空，經綏遠以達寗夏，這</p>
<p>一天旅途中他們曾靜靜的沿着渭河降落在鄂縣，加添油類，再往北朝西飛，一直探索到黃河的上游及其水源地區。</p>
<p>四天以後（十七日），他們才由蘭州飛回西安，當天下午去臨潼洗一個溫泉浴，和探訪十年零五天以前震撼世界的「西安事變」發生地。傍晚歸來，宿泊在西京招待所，這也是一座與「西安事變」有關的歷史建築物。一宿醒來，開始他們的勘察工作。日程一共分爲四段。</p>
<p>第一條路程是考察黃河中游，他們經過韓城於廿日到達黃河汾河口略北的龍門一帶，歸程時順便參觀洛河及其水利灌溉工程。他們本來打算再往北去宜川縣屬的壺口，但壺口的東岸就是山西的吉縣，地近戰區，祗好作罷。同時因爲根據兩個月前黃河治本團的勘察報告，差不多已一致認爲壺口的價値比不上龍門。（請參去年十二月廿八日本版西安通訊「壺口·龍門」）當他們到達那一天，本來早已結凍的黃河，大概表示歡迎千里萬里而來的「大夫」們吧，河冰意外的局部解凍，濺濺黃水顯示出活力和希望。</p>
<p>薩凡奇博士是個百分之二百的愼重人，從南京出發後這幾千里路程上，據說從不肯發表半句局部的初步結論。筆者祗從間接方面獲悉，他對於龍門以北的石門峽，認爲是壺口與龍門，禹門六十五公里間最爲滿意的一個建築水壩地點。其他的中美專家在那裏分別作了一番精密和多角的考察，但歸來時亦無人願意發表個別的意見和推算數字。其綜合的結論，怕要在返回南京經過一番整理和推敲以後，才有發表。</p>
<p>石門峽，當地居民亦稱之曰「八扁担」，以形容黃河在這一段如何窄狹。根據「黃河治本團」張含英和陝水利局劉鍾瑞，關文啓諸氏的最新意見，他們一致認爲石門峽的利用價値最大，將來「黃顧國」的結論，很可能與此十分相近。</p>
<p>薩氏一行本來還要北溯洛河上游，但目前那一帶土地，在中國政治地圖上屬於延安控制區，所以他們走得到看得到的僅限於洛河下游，和「洛惠渠」的灌溉受益區。在那裏和在「涇惠渠」受益區裏，他們看到陝省主要產棉區，並且極度讚美陝省棉田每單位面積的生產量，超出美國棉田的數倍。事實上，陝省今年獲到全國棉花增產的首名獎狀，除了得力於農學家改良品種以外，就靠這幾條渠來灌溉。</p>
<p>一行疲勞而交混着興奮地歸來西安，正是聖誕節的前夜。</p>
<p>涇河上游</p>
<p>並不是說「黃顧團」在此過渡了一九四六年的除夕，因而這位六十六歲白髮老人薩凡奇，到了離陝東返時已是六十七歲。他的生日與基督耶穌及科學家牛頓同一天，而今年恰在西安渡過了。當天正午，他手執銀刀，帶着無限喜悅，切開三秦黃土上種育得來的麥粉製壽糕。</p>
<p>廿六日開始第二條勘察路程，沿着公路到涇河上游到那縣，再向西北行四十公里達亭口，那裏正是涇河馬連河，和靈台河的會合口，河水很汹湧，從前有人認爲極有利用的價値，但今次「黃顧團」的意見，似乎未作如此高度的評價，將來的結論，很可能澈底修正前人的意見。不過涇河本身在亭口的下游尙有十八處跌水，都可作爲水電的動力。涇河的水源地帶，亦屬「邊區」，他們沒有去勘察。</p>
<p>第三段路程是廿八日到渭河西段寳鷄峽，地在寳鷄以西十五公里。薩幾奇氏對於這段河道將來築壩發電，具有同感，且極滿意。在他的記錄册裹，已經繪下秦隴高原水電站的草圖了。廿九日返西安，完成了黃河上游中游的全部勘察工作。</p>
<p>記述到這裏，關於「黃顧團」之兼顧和重視，洛，涇，渭三河，有稍加說明的必要。這同時亦可以說明下述第四段行程到黃河下游三門峽視察的意義。</p>
<p>遠在薩凡奇等這次來華實地勘察黃河以前，最高經濟委員會事先徵集了許多資料到美國，作爲行前的準備。不過我國治黃專家之間，有許多是僅僅集中注意力於黃河下游，尤以河南陝州三門峽附近，最受重視。他們認爲祗要在那裏築一水壩，即可防止下游的氾濫，和利用蒂水來溉田，發電。但另外一些專家，則以爲澈底治理黃河，必要從上游中游先下手，否則依然是「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」的治標手段，而非根本的對策。就與陝省有關的一段黃河來說，依劉鍾瑞氏的意見，認爲黃河下游決口的原因，與汾，涇，渭河河水有極密切的關係。所以，要築壩節制黃水，應該先由支流入手。從地質，水文，交通諸觀點來看，涇，渭，洛，汾四條支河和黃河主流中游的龍門附近，不獨有許多優良的築壩地址；而且由經濟，實用，耐久等等的尺度來衡量，這些地點都比三門峽一地更爲理想。這兩種不同的主張，正是治理黃河全錢一個很大的課題，不容輕易下斷。爲了解決這疑問，「黃顧團」在陝西先後分別勘察過洛，連，渭三河以後，還要往東跑去河兩，在陝州附近化了兩天勘察日程。這是他們第四段路。回到西安時，恰在一九三六年最後的一日！當然，這條大問題並不是爲上就可以獲到結論的，不過我們晚得，「黃河治本團」上幾個月勘察結果，認爲在三門峽略東屬新安縣屬的八里胡同，尙有一峽谷此三門峽更宜於築壩蓄水。</p>
<p>十三顧問</p>
<p>「黃顧團」十三位團員陣容是「超級」的：薩凡奇氏不用再介紹，其他如雷巴德氏，葛羅同氏在中國雖不大爲普通人所稔知，但在美國都是第一流專家，一如該團中幾位中國顧問也是他祖國水利事業「智囊團」中有數人物。十幾天逗留在陝西，有人認爲够長了，但內行人仍然認爲不過是初步的「走馬看花」。盡管有無數册一尺一尺厚的參考資料，無數幀大大小小由陸地和空中的照片，依然未足以寫下最後的結論，更談不到具體的方案和動工完工的時日了。然而偉大的「黃域安」（HVA）計劃，無疑的正在專家手中的計算尺上孕育着。</p>
<p>是的，科學可以克服中國有史以前就開始的黃河水患，但從藍圖到實施，從實施到收穫効果，還有其他條件。「治理黃河並不單是技術上的問題；中國整個經濟問題政治問題之納入正軌，是一切水利建設的先決條件。』陝省水利當局一位最高級人員曾道麼對記者說。</p>
<p>「黃顧團」今次之云不了壺口，看不到洛河涇河上游，爲了什麼呢？</p>
<p>鐵路英雄　平綏路西段管理處長　紀　（本報駐綏記者劉映元　）</p>
<h3>平綏路德再造者　歸綏六日航訊　本報駐綏記者劉映元</h3>
<p>平綏路自從興工以來，祗出過兩個偉大的工程匠師：一個是穿破南口千山萬嵌的詹天佑先生，一個便是年來搶修全綫破壞路基，如同軍事進展神速的西段管理處的蘇紀忍處長。詹天佑建築平綏路，是山海洋征服沙漠；蘇紀忍擔修平綏路，是從沙漠尋找海洋，前者用的是科學的技術和文明的才智，後者用的是原始的毅力和野蠻的幹勁。所以蘇紀忍於綏包解圍後一禮拜通車，大同解圍後半月內通車，張垣收復一個月中通至北平和柴溝堡，不到兩個月使平綏路全綫通車，這一連串的光業表現，此詹天佑的功業，允被人目爲是一種奇蹟。因此社會上的一般人說：「蘇紀忍是平綏路的再造者」。</p>
<p>在砲火閃電下　搶修鐵路</p>
<p>我們不先說明共軍對平綏路慘酷，便無法介紹蘇紀忍的輝煌成就。蘇紀忍於去年日本投降後，就擔任了平綏路西段管理處的處長。卞二戰區的先遣部隊於八月十三日進入包頭，共軍緊接着在包頭大同之間施行破壞鐵路。當綏南專員郭長淸在十八日那天接收了歸綏，共軍首决將綏遠的省會圍困，並派遣勁旅在畢克齊鎭站阻止國軍東進，將附近的鐵路橋　完全炸倒，使兵車無法通過。那幾天正下大雨，蘇紀忍處長隨軍趕到前綫，傅長官一面命令孫蘭峰將軍驅逐畢克齊鎮內的匪徒，一面限二十四小時內呌他把鐵路修好。當時鐵路工人都因打仗而四散逃走，蘇紀忍便指揮部隊的工兵，在砲火閃電下，於十八個小時內就搶修完成。才使解救省會的馳援部隊，很快速的到達歸綏。</p>
<p>蘇紀忍於民國六年從北京大學土木工程系，，考取留美官費，轉入R.P.I大學土木工程系讀書。民國九年畢業後，並在華特爾橋樑工程顧問處實習，民國十二年返國後，歷任平綏路局工務處長，和隴海正太兩路的工程技正。他在八年抗戰當中給傅長官往來平津陝壩做地下工作時，很了解鐵路員工的痛苦，所以他接收平綏路西段管理處以後，並沒有把每一個淪陷區的員工都看成澫奸；反而特別關懷他們的生活。那時交通部的經費匯不到綏遠，全由蘇紀忍向傳長官借錢，保持員工的豐衣足食。因此他們都願在他領導之下，藉恢復交通報効國家。任共軍天天破壞，員工總是日日擔修。在十月十七日共軍大舉圍攻綏包以前，包頭到大同全長一千華里的鐵路，始終沒有中斷。</p>
<p>冒着絕大危險　交涉機車</p>
<p>去年下月十七日，共軍在綏東開始行動的時候，蘇紀忍親自冒着絕大的危險，到大同向二戰區交涉四五輛機車，要不是他這個蠻牛，現在祗有四輛機軍在西段行動。共軍圍攻包頭時，他很從容的完成軍站撤退，把機車的重要零件，都卸下拉到包頭城裏，不像大同軍站的九輛江號機車被共軍整個燒成廢鐵。綏包解圍正在去年舊層臘月，共軍將歸綏至台閣間的枕木統通扒走，綏包間的橋樑水塔沒有一處未遭重大破壞。那時天寒地凍，氣溫在零度以下。據許多人估計，必須一月以後方可恢復交通。誰也沒有想到一禮拜內就行通車。其中的奧妙，就是蘇紀忍和員工們在冰天雪野上並肩作戰，當他的手指凍成紫紅以後，底下的員工就不會感覺到寒冷了。從那一次起，綏遠的軍民開始認識了蘇紀忍處長，不僅是一個勞苦的工程師，而且是一員堅毅的戰將。</p>
<p>化裝商人模樣　深入敵陣</p>
<p>蘇紀忍宣統三年在山西大學中學部讀書時，正遇見辛亥革命，他在那時就和陸軍小學的傳作義將軍同時加入了山西學生軍，到娘子蘭抗拒淸兵，曾經担任過一度連長。廿七年他由正太路撤退至西安，闖過敵僞和散兵盤据擾胤的地帶，跑到河曲追隨傳長官抗戰。武功會娥時他和傳長官同軍到西安分手，由河內經過香港潛赴平津做地下工作。直到珍珠港事變後，才由天津回到陝壩。他表面上担任了綏遠省政府的工程總顧問，實際上仍往來平綏綫收集敵僞的情報。對傅長官歷决作戰有很大的帮助。</p>
<p>三十三年二月，他終於在天津被包頭日本特務機關派去的憲兵扣住，因爲蘇紀忍的態度很强硬，站在中國人的立塲，和包頭的日本特務機關負責人田中展開雄辯。結果日本人被他的慷慨激昂氣度懾服，不但沒有把他殺害，返而把他護送回國軍的防綫。去年蘇聯對日宣戰的消息傳到陝壩，傳長官又派蘇紀忍化裝成商人，乘座汽車進入包頭策動偽軍。八月十日敵人接受波茨坦宣言的夜晚，他首先公開的跑到日軍司令部，歡吿他們向十二戰區投降，幾乎被敵人拉出去槍斃。不過特務機關的兒玉顧問終被蘇紀忍說服，本來日本是十五日宣佈投降，國軍最早也得在十六日進城，他們在十三日的夜晚，便將十二戰區的先遣部隊接收包頭。當時許多人把「蘇紀忍的一片嘴，等於傳長官的三師兵」，做爲受降的佳話。也是從那時起，許多人才知道綏遠的神秘的工程總顧問，原來是十二戰區的無名英雄。我們從蘇紀忍以往不平凡的經歷看來，這個山西猗氏縣嵋陽鎭耕讀家庭的產兒，不僅有農民的氣質，工人的修養，而且具有軍官的果敢，和大政治家的風度和手腕。</p>

<p>平緩路西段的員工，在集寗會戰以前，因爲火車祗能從包頭通到三道營，各種修路的準備在五月間就已完成，可是遲遲不能開工，所以每個人都陷入無事做的苦悶，蘇紀忍在這個階段，特別注意員工的文化活動和學習風氣，他用圖書館和劇國運動塲，給同人們的心緒上加油。所以集寗會戰開始，蘇紀忍好像帶着一羣生龍活虎跑上前綫，他們先在共軍砲彈射程和散匪的暗槍底下，很快的給三道營至卓資山間六十里內，重新輔了一道路軌；其後國軍在九月十四日完全佔領集寗，蘇紀忍親自督工把新安莊和四城四的兩座大橋便道修成，於十月一日那天，最先帶着兩個路警，在堡子灣和共軍邊走打的，座着壓道車前往收拾大同車站的殘破局面。許多沒人管的大同員工，跟他在火焚的機車塲的瓦礫上抱頭痛哭。</p>
<p>共軍看到大同以西搶修神速，所以對大同至張　間的鐵路，比三道營至卓資山間還要破壞的澈底。全長一百八十公里內，就有九十多公里，沒有剩下一很枕本。鐵軌都用繩子拉彎，水塔完全崩毀，站台一律點火，他們還利用値錢的民力，把路基攤平。蘇紀忍把大同御河橋得工程佈置好，於雙十節前返回集寗，乘汽車前往張家口修路，行至玫瑰營子附近，在三百米以外發現一團共軍的騎兵，險些把他乘座的那輛孤單汽車伴虜。不過蘇紀忍爾達張家口以後，却拿察綏兩省的老弱員工，和北平來的大批專家技師，同時由張家口和西撥子向下花園賽跑，而超過兩站在沙城會師的冠軍業譽，補償了他在集寗張垣路上所受的驚恐。現在蘇紀忍又回到了歸綏，定於日內赴大同以東搶修，他保證本月月底即可接軌。我們這一盞交通界的燈塔，又將要給佈滿陰霾的平綏路沿綫放射塊麗的光彩。</p>
<p>蘇紀忍處長，今年五十二歲，這個小老頭兒，身體好像一個農夫，氣度如同一個士兵。他最愛穿工人的衣裝，嘴上經常　着一根紙煙，腰間老插着一支手槍。他不修邊幅，也不講究吃喝，富有冒險精神和正義感。他和有爲的靑年很相好，公餘看戲時跟小伙子們座在一塊鼓掌喝彩。並帮助學生和文化人士，很受靑年們愛戴。他對人非常爽直，有不對的地方當時就指出，不講面子和客套。他的夫人田玉册女士，是山西名士渾源田子　的小姐，現在在綏遠領導婦遝工作。他的獨生子蘇庭彥，戰前就到了甫方，後來考入航空幼年學校，目前在航空大學讀書。他因爲從事抗戰工作和排除建國障碍，父子們已經有十年沒有見面，因此他對扶輪小學的學生，如同自己的子弟一樣愛惜。</p>
<h3>遼東半島　在凍風寒雪中</h3>
<p>— 岫岩四日航訊　本報特約記者關榮欽</p>
<p>遼東半島的人們，正在讚美着今年的「冬」來得特別晚，正在享受着「小春」天氣似的滋味之際，雲，驀地像成羣成隊的白鳥似地，從天而降了。給凹凸不平的原野，給大大小小的城鎭。村莊，披上一件縞素的白衣：前此孤獨地站得遠遠的峯密，不的而同地倚偎在一處，並且跑到人們的跟前來了；她們也和人類一樣，抗不過數冬的凄苦與寒凍，都倚倀在一起，好像彼此間獲取些溫暖。</p>
<p>居在半島的同胞，和別個地方的東北同胞一樣；也慢吞吞地擬過敵僞給他們的十多年的磨難。「九一八」以後的兩三年中，他們也聽過義勇軍，游擊隊一類的名詞；甚至，他們有些人還　强地參加過義勇軍，打過游擊。不過「時間」把他們的記憶冲得稀淡了，今年的冬天，出乎他們意外地，又出現了使他們的記憶復活的新的事物。</p>
<p>「大哥，今天有我們的兩千多同志到貴鄉來，請給我們預備點吃的！」</p>
<p>「老鄉，明天我們有五千多同志要路過貴處往東去，大家都是中國人，給我們預備點炭火，茶水吧！至緊：你們可不要走瀾消息！」</p>
<p>這一類突如其來的消息，使給寒風白雪把腦子擠塞得不大愛活動的村民，打起寒噤來，像無主孤魂似地亂轉，胆强心壯的，就冒着風雪到有國軍駐守的鄰鄉或城里報吿去。頭一二回，眞約有些國軍或地方保安團隊揮車驅馬，結果都撲了個空。接着人們也就聽到某屯捉住兩個借炭求糧的代表的消息了。</p>
<p>「他媽的，我就不管他有幾千幾萬！」腦子本來不大愛活動的人們胆壯起來了！</p>
<p>一個多月前，記者到岫岩。聽說有一位八路參謀投誠到龍天武將軍的司令部去。</p>
<p>他們說，那個參謀本來是「奉命到遼陽海城一帶打游擊，不准出來的」。我沒有看見過他，因爲我到岫岩前幾天他已被送到瀋陽去了。</p>
<p>一個月來，我却看見過幾批投誠或俘虜來的八路，他們是預備轉送去瀋陽的。有一回，在一所破廟里我看到四十多人。有些穿着棉衣，有些僅穿着夾衣，攏着手，咬着牙，在寒風里發抖。據一位矮個子的政工人員吿訴我，他（她）們都是比較重要的，所以先送，還有好幾百，過幾天才送。國軍弟兄不少也來「看熱鬧」，你看看他，他看看你，可是總看不出敵意來：這敎我記起了童年的往事來：那時在鄉間常和與自己年齡相若的野孩子做「兵捉賊」的遊戲；自己擒過「俘虜」，也被人擒過而當「俘虜」。難道眼前的四十多位同胞，要比我從前當過的「俘虜」嚴重些嗎？四十多名俘虜中，有五位女的。頂年長的一位，約摸三十五六歲；和她一同做俘虜的，還有她那一歲多的孩子。那矮個十的政工人員吿訴我：她的丈夫是八路縣府的敎育科科長。五名女俘虜中，她無形中做了代表！一則，她年紀較大；二則，她穿着黃色棉軍服，戴軍帽，而其餘的四位都穿着百姓衣裳；三則，她的目光老射着每一個來「看熟鬧」的人們，現出「有問必答」的神氣。我就和她搭訕起來了。她是河北人，她的丈夫是遼陽人，到河北去敎書，也就在河北和她結婚了。她說「抗戰時我們鄉間只有八路軍，要是有中央軍，我們也早就參加中央軍了」。此次和她一同被俘的四位女的，其中三人是山東人，僅受過初小敎育，是被八路強征出來的，她們說：「不去可不成」。另一位是莊河人，是十七八歲的初中生。奇怪，在那四十多名的俘虜中，竟有三個日本人。兩男一女，據說那兩個男的是技工，女的是其中之一的妻子。男的倒不在乎，那個女的却頹喪地坐在她的舖蓋上面，聽說後來她還哭過一陣：因爲是晚飯開遲了。又聽說，還沒有運來的俘虜中，還有好些輕重機槍射手是日本人。這班日本人，是第二次還是第三次做俘虜呢？</p>
<p>在許穎將軍的指揮所裏，我看到三位投誠的八路幹部。一名葛貴，係獨立師二團一營的敎導員，河北人，三十多歲，七八年前就在延安參加中共；一名王有仁，是一營的副敎導員，山東人，參加八路才兩年多；另一名王春華，是一營三連的特務長。三人中，以葛貴較冷靜，不大說話。最興奮的，是王有仁那個山東人，他們三人都是在岫岩西南　子附近投降的，和他們一同投降的還有四十多名八路弟兄。</p>
<p>「我們這一營人看到國軍，就散的散，溜的溜，投降的投降。「老鄉，大家都是中國人，不要放槍，我們都是中國人，我們投降的！」說着就把槍放下，舉起手，一共四十多人』王有仁的話裏有笑，有駡，還有莫名的悲哀。他還說：</p>
<p>我們抗戰幾年，勝利了，本來，我們就可以回家。他媽的，又拖着我們打！……今天到這裏，明天到那裏，深夜在山裏行軍，踩着那末厚的雪，……一天到晚，不知什麼時候才有吃，一頓半頓也不定……大家都是中國人嘛！」</p>
<p>誰說不是「自己人」呢？在一個作爲傷兵轉運站的澡堂裏，託者看見二十多位受傷的國軍弟兄和八路弟兄：灰棉衣，黃棉衣，肩併肩坐着，足對足躺着，他們都是在復縣水門子廟一役負傷的。一位頭部紥着綳帶的國軍弟兄吿訴我：「水門子廟的一仗眞老火，輕機槍，小鋼砲，不描準打出去就成」！負傷的八路弟兄中，有兩個才十八九歲：一名宋英傑，雲南保山人，頭部受傷，紮着綳帶，轉動不靈，不愛說話，另一名劉萬由，遼中人，臂部受傷，也許是由於傷不重，就侃侃而談他的故事。</p>
<p>「看到國軍，我就和宋英傑把輕機轉過頭，對着我們連長打，他也用手槍打我們，可是他死了，我們只受了點傷」！</p>
<p>「他媽的！八路！死路！向南跑，有大鼻子，向西，有海，向東向北，都有中央軍，還不是死路」！時萬由的話剛說完，和他並排坐着以及對面躺着的灰棉衣和黃棉衣都起了一陣騷動。</p>
<p>據從火綫上回來的國軍軍官們說：為着防止臨陣投降，八路多用縱隊攻擊前進，不敢散開，因爲一散開，投降的就接二連三·用密集的縱隊前進，也許可以减少投降，可是死傷起來，就是一堆一堆的，多殘忍啊！慰勞國軍呀，慰勞傷兵呀，在岫岩，在鳳城，在莊河，在貔子窩，在普蘭店……都常有看到。地方那麼窮，物價那末高，看他（她）們挪出來用作慰勞的三元，五元，十元百元的鈔票，與其說是「錢」，無寗說是「淚」！我看到鳳城中小學生慰勞國軍的信，眼前就浮動着無數張熱淚橫流的小險！</p>
<p>日本人統治東北十四年，使東北同胞在文學上甚至語言上，不錯是染上點「協和」的色彩，可是他們要想把祖國觀念從東北同胞的腦子裏壓出來，則不但十四年不成，甚至四十年五十年也不成。城子瞳，是「關東州」東北端的一個小城鎭，鎭裏的同胞們，在日俄戰爭時代，曾經看見過日軍從該鎭西南的　十窩登陸，北上與帝俄軍隊作戰，日俄戰爭以後，他們就實際上在日人統治下過活了。此次國軍（龍天武將軍陳英部）進駐時，該鎭的老者就興奮得發狂；拉着弟兄們連哭帶笑，說他們已經沒有看見過國軍五十年！把弟兄們也感動得熱淚橫流了！</p>
<p>國軍收復的地區，老百姓是攏開做生意的門面了，可是由於人人身邊的貨物，沒有成了廢紙的「八路票子」多，於是大家都鬧窮。糧價一斤漲了幾元，就坐在一起嘆氣，嘆完氣之後，總是有「這個戰事什麼時候才完結呢」這句話。</p>
<p>這裏幾個縣份的中小學，在八路走了之後，都相繼復課了；可是學校設備却是「空空如也」。通常的現象是：參考書沒有一本，敎科書到學期要結束了才運到，還是有這樣缺那樣，岫岩男中連椅桌也凑不齊，有兩班學生還站着上課。做過八路傷兵病院的岫岩女中，其校長室比軍隊前方指揮所還簡陋。該校從十月就復課了，而省府發的經費却是從十</p>
<p>一月份起算：經費那末少，除了買粉筆之外，剩下來的買取暖的柴火也不够，還說添點什麽設備？什麽理化室，圖書室，除了門口掛着的小牌牌而外，這一塊小木板也找不到。全校才有一個工友，工友病了就由老師搖鈴上下課。經費不够，柴火不够，唯一的辦法，是提前放假，元旦一遇，就大考，一考，就大家回家。聽說軍方在幾天之後要演劇代學校籌款，不知能籌到幾文？</p>
<p>以岫岩為中心，不論去海域，去鳳城，去安東，去莊河，或去孤山街，都有公路可通。一個多月前坐在車子上，直把你腸吐心嘔，八路撤退前之破壞公路，　裁黃歸一樣：隔三四丈就來那末深深的一斬；經鄉民的一再塡補，月來才好的多，燒木炭的商車，問或出現了；可是車費那末貴，坐車又得露頭透頂地給風劃　咬，要不是有必要，誰也不想爬上去。從鳳城到安東的火車是通了；可是牠也和公路上的商車一樣樣：燒木炭；一走三停，有些人就寗好坐板車甚至索性步行，省得　煩。莊河西南的貔子窩，復縣的普蘭店，都經國軍收復了。半島上的人們，尤其那逃亡到瀋陽的二十萬大連同胞，都在懷緬着大連——那「日本化」的水都！</p>
<p>新年來了，半島的同胞們，似乎還沒有作「新」的打算，倒是那班天眞無邪的孩子們，還連　結隊去那冰凍了的河濱推雪車，溜冰，他們像是這白得發紅的半島上唯一有生氣的動物？</p>
<h3>建設東遼河</h3>
<p>— 本報東北特派員　韓淸濤　瀋陽四日航訊</p>
<p>遼河是東北的黃河，少舟　灌溉之利，多氾濫淤塞之災。敵僞爲了它，曾經費了很長的時間，下了一大套資本和人力，一定要把它化災害爲有利，工程已經做了很多，當然這裏十分之八九是我們同胞血汗的結晶？</p>
<p>道些工程是有價値的，是値得注意的，在這裹報導在光復後大家通方合作已經糧續或者說是一個較早復工的大工程，那就是遼河支流的東遼河水利工程。</p>
<p>東遼河——遼河支流之一，發源山脈在連綿的西安縣屬的薩哈嶺裏，蜿蜓向東南奔流，一直到橫過中長鐵路以後，　進入沃野千里的太平原，這裏的確是「阡陌縱橫」「碧綠靑葱」，適於農耕的地方，據「東北水利述要」記載，河的全長凡三三三，五公里，流域面積達一〇一　，八〇平方公里，流經西安，懷德，梨樹等縣，到了枯楡樹，註入了遼河。</p>
<p>敵偽時期的經營</p>
<p>日本人爲了移民增產，加强他們侵略的資本，曾到「東遼河防洪灌溉工程」爲緊急工程之一，在他們擬定的計劃中，包括建壩，蓄水，導流，灌溉，造林，防風，防沙三大要項，他們預期目標，要增闢水旱田六十萬畝，增產水稻雜糧八萬六千餘噸，並可將東遼河二七〇〇秒立方公尺的洪水量，减到每秒五一〇立方公尺，好不再有洪水　濫災患，同時對下游的枯水航運以及四平市的工業用水，得到解決。</p>
<p>偽滿為實現這個計劃，曾由偽「滿洲拓殖公社」，於民國三十二年底，在四平街東滴打嘴子，開始建築橫跨東遼河的大攔河壩，原計劃壩的高度，爲廿六·八公尺，長度爲五百六十公尺，其中一百公尺爲高十八公尺的鋼骨水泥滾水堰，以瀉溢洪水，至前年八·一五光復前夕，僅僅元成了百分之八十，據說當時日人爲配合軍需，爭取時效，會不顧一切，務使五年工程，於二年內做成，強微我國農民服役，組織所謂「勤勞奉仕隊」及「愛國勤勞隊」，不分寒暑，畫夜進行着。</p>
<p>重建工作之發動</p>
<p>水委會東北區特派員辦公處，鑒於工程的最主要部份欄河土壩，敵偽巳完成部份，它的高度，仍在洪水位以下，而且厚度不足，一旦夏汛秋洪驟至，不但本工程有冲毀的可能，同時下遊受災面積將達二二八萬畝，遂和善後救濟總署東北分署，遼北省政府洽定，組設「東遼河工程委員會」，負責推動和指導監督本工程的復工事宜，同時由水利特派員辦公處，組設東遼河工程局，負責本工程的實施。</p>
<p>工程局在八月一日正式在滴打嘴子工地成立，當時決定施工原則，計主要工程，採取招商娥做，零星工程，則採取自設工程隊辦理，東遼河工程局成立後，即着手各項準備工作，懺淸理工地，整理殘餘器材，修理工具器材，添購器材，修繕房舍和火藥庫，電力間，機械廠，修補道路，同時，在瀋陽辦理招商事宜，上項工作，截至八月底止，大部吿一段落，招商部份，經有關各方決議，交由忠信，利華，建成三營造廠承做，共計包價爲東北流通券五七，七一七，七七五。〇〇元。</p>
<p>主要工程的進行</p>
<p>本工程主要部份，計有壩身塡土，開採塊石，塊石護坡，塊石護岸，混凝土護岸，混凝土橋面，混凝土閘墩，草皮護坡等八項，其中壩身塡土，開採塊石，在九月初旬，首先開工，塊石護坡，混凝土，滾水壩，閘墩一項，繼而也隨着付諸實施。</p>
<p>混凝土閘墩，是在九月下旬開工，截至十一月上旬止，進行尙稱順利，塊石護坡工程，因壩身塡土和遝石關係，至十月中旬，方開始舖砌，截至十二月上句，僅元成三四二〇公方，現正書夜趕工，期於三十六年一月將其完成。</p>
<p>由四平向工地去，在石嶺車站迤北，就可看到堆着斗，車軸和殘存的機器，再走三十華里的路程，欄河大壩，巍然矗立東辦河身上，碧綠的人造湖，也略具雛形，據說：日人為東遼河工程，曾專設有機器工具修理廠，製材廠氣壓工廠等，又有鑚探機，開山機挖土機碎石機等，惜因八一五以後之破壞，現在壩頂上僅有兩架無綫電式的鐵塔起重機在絞動着，六架坦克車式的　壓機在怒吼着，其餘的抽水機，洋灰攪拌機，開山機，以及各型各色的機器，都在隆隆作響，壩頂上七條鐵軌上的一百六十輛運送車，在川流不息的運土塊運石頭。</p>
<p>卅五年底，蓄水庫工程，大部完成，至於灌溉區，還遠在中長鐵路以西，距離滴打嘴子”尙有六十餘公里，她的範圍，南起小城子，老松林子，二龜山和孤家子，北迄遼河南岸，這塊新聞的農產區，以前還是人煙稀少，十分荒凉的去處，現在雖未竣工，已經是渠道縱橫，設一旦將渠道附屬工程像引水節水閘壩，渡槽，跌水，公路橋樑等完成，就可導水灌溉，這項工程，因為材料準備不及，加上地方不靖，還未開工，预計明年四月開始趕辨，七月間結凍前可以完成，這是一個偉大的工程，對　國計民生，也是不可忽視的！</p>

<h3>美國的內政外交</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>足以左右世界未來命運</p>
<p>戰後美國已成爲世界問題的核心，社魯門總統今後所當採取的內政外交政策，足以左右世界未來的命運。所以全世界的人民都把視綫集中在杜魯門總統於六日對國會所發表的咨文上。在這一篇冗長的咨文裹，將美國今後所當採取的內政外交政策，予以詳盡的說明。杜魯門總統的政策雖然沒有像故總統羅斯福所採取的政策，富有遠大而崇高的理想，但是在實際上，仍不失爲中庸切實的辦法，在目前的環境之下，杜魯門也唯有取這種方針，始能獲得民主黨與共和黨的一致擁戴。</p>
<p>兩黨合作　政局可定</p>
<p>共和黨對於杜魯門的咨文，除了在內政上有些意見而外無不表示滿意。誠如參議院議長范登堡所說：「杜魯門總統咨文，措辭溫和婉轉，實爲共和黨議員一致所贊成，總統對於白宮與國會之關係所提出之論據，亦能言之有理，」同時共和黨衆議員哈勒克也說；「共和黨亦願與杜魯門總統合作，使美國問題獲致公平解決。相信共和與民主兩黨，在衆議院內，必能和衷共濟，」由此可知，杜魯門總統對國會發表咨文之後，在美國國內已獲得良好的反響，兩黨的合作絕無問題，從此也可以預料到杜魯門總統在任期屆滿以前，不致與國會發生齟齬而在政治上引起軒然大波，所以杜魯門總統向國會發表的咨文，終算替美國政局獲得了暫時的安定。</p>
<p>馬帥返國　任國務卿</p>
<p>馬歇爾特使的離華返國，已是惹人注意的新聞，當其在中國步入專機的時候，國務卿貝爾納斯辭職由馬帥繼任的消息，也傳到了中國，這實在是一九四七年的第一件重要新聞，動動了全世界。</p>
<p>美國參議院對於杜魯門德統任命馬帥爲國務鄉，於八日即全體一致的予以批准，竟無一表示異議，在美國政治史上實在是罕有的現象。時代雜誌稱頌貝爾納斯爲一九四六年的偉人，我們實在可以說篤帥是美國近代史上之眞正的偉大人物。馬帥奉命來華調處國共衝突，歷十一個月之久，不僅曾與各方面接觸，並曾默察中國暨遠東局勢的演進，故深知中國的政情，並洞悉遠東局勢的核心何在！所以我們預料馬帥歸國就職之後，美國外交政策的重點，必將集中在遠東，馬帥憑其超人的智慧及其百戰百勝的韜略。遝用其外交手腕，對於中國問題的和平解決，必將有更重大的貢獻。同時對於美蘇關係，也必能設法加以改善，恢復兩國前在戰時互信互助的精神，共同致力於和平的締造，至少可使一九四七年的國際局勢，展開一幕美妙的遠景。</p>
<h3>麻風病　用消發治療</h3>
<p>美國衛生處的痳瘋病顧問委員會最近發表一篇撲減痳瘋病計劃書，希望用强力的「消發」（Sulpfa）類新藥治愈全世界三百萬痳瘋患者，消減人類的最大敵人之一。該委員會特別指出痳瘋可以右效治療，甚至完全治愈，但必須施行早期診斷，並應用最新式的治療法。　該委員會希望在今後數年內把流行於美國的痳瘋病完全肅淸，並且希望用新式的診斷法和治療法迅速並普遍地遏制全世界各地的痳瘋病。</p>
<h3>日本已變成思想戰的戰塲</h3>
<p>— 許弘譯自讀者文摘</p>
<p>盟國佔領下第二年的日本已變成了思想戰的戰塲了。向美國挑戰的是蘇聯，這戰鬥的結果將決定親日本，是否是「一個强大的和平堡壘，抑或是危險的戰爭跳板」（麥帥語）。</p>
<p>這戰鬥祗有日本人自己來決定其結果；有些觀察家以爲：這初生的民主，還敵不過赤色壓力，別些熟悉日本的美國人相信：日本民主的根基，雖才新近種下，却是强大的而且是種在十分肥沃的地面上。</p>
<p>現在，使戰後歐洲變爲恐怖的戰鬥亦向日本猛襲。日本現在正被兩個相反的勢力在撕拉，而這兩個勢力都迷惑地允許給與人民以自由。</p>
<p>在投降之後，政治犯的釋放復原了共產黨徒的活動，由中國共產區，來了一隊，結果，共產黨掌握了新生日本的工運，無綫電廣播和出版事業。</p>
<p>在一九四六年一月，大多數銷路極廣的東京和大阪報紙及較小省份的新聞紙都明白地傾向於左派。那些不公開承認是屬於共產黨的報紙大聲地擁護共產黨底論題。東京有三家大報的雇工趕走了老闆和主編－而攖得了編輯的管理權。在政府下令禁止之前，這種方法代替了一般工人底武器：罷工。</p>
<p>在最初，最高統帥部好像不願千涉而且事實上，還有少數的往來各地負有統帥部的工作者，暗地表鼓勵日本底左翼份子，但當這些被麥帥注意之後，報紙配給事宜交給了可以信任的人員，有些美國人亦被「送了回去」。</p>
<h3>壓力來自蘇京</h3>
<p>今日日本人民是在左翼的極大壓力下生活着。沒有辦法可以隱飾這種壓力的來源是來自斯莫科的事實。這壓力是分兩層來實施：公開的是在東京的盟國諮詢會；隱藏的是在公衆的意見中，那是用以淆亂和激動日本羣衆的</p>
<p>在上層，一個適當的但是膨大的外交團體，由准將古斯瑪，第里夫揚科率領代表着蘇聯，它包括有五百人之多。（英國代表祗有三十二個團員）蘇聯在佔領工作中是沒有活躍的任務的，第里夫揚科底任務是在每兩週一次的會議中（把國內所有）對麥帥底政策的抨擊捧出來－這些，都由麥帥底代表艾契遜巧妙地避開</p>
<p>在下一騰，蘇聯底策略是大大約有效的。蘇聯在西伯利亞的煖波電台每天向日本作強烈的反麥帥，反政府的羅駡廣擭。雖然在日本祗有不到五百座的短波收音機，但是，它的存在，就把這宣傳送到日本人底心裏，而且，任何特別廣播，在廿四小時至四十八小時之內，就可以在日本報紙上找到反應。</p>
<p>很多日本人間爲什麼美國不阻止這睦活動。答案是：在民主政治下，即使和現實極端相反的意見亦有權說出，批評和討論，甚至曲解事實。這祗看讓每個人自已來區別其是非，現在日本人已開始看破蘇聯式的民主了。</p>
<h3>到月球去</h3>
<p>— 譯自雜誌文摘</p>
<p>「月球旅行」快要成爲事實了。現在人類己經開始作破天荒第一决世外旅行的實際準備了，這回的主辦人並非是好出風頭的僞科學家，而是脚踏實地的美國陸軍</p>
<p>今年美國陸軍曾由雷達電波的媒介「達到」了月球。明年將有一架無人駕駛的火箭，載有無綫電自動報吿儀器，試作廿四萬英里路程的單程飛行。此後，只等科學解決幾個比較困難的問題以後，人類便可實地嘗試「月球旅行」了。美空軍火箭組主任卡爾杭少校最近曾對華盛頓合衆社記者說：他希望此生能實地往返月球一决。</p>
<p>關於「月球旅行」的準備和目的，科學論文作家已在著名雜誌裏有詳盡的討論。</p>
<p>因爲月球上旣沒有水。空氣和食物，也沒有像地球上那樣的氣候，所以月球探險家必須穿着七百磅重貯有全部生活必需品特製服裝。但是，由於月球質量和引力較小的緣故，這些在地球上七百磅重的服裝，在月球上只有一百四十磅重，同時那服裝裏面的探險家的一百八十磅的體重在月球上只有三十五磅。</p>
<p>人類要想從地球上飛出去，必須發明一只超高速度的火箭，須具有足以克服地心吸力的每秒鐘七英里的速度。所用的馬達其效率只須兩倍於現有馬達便可。人類征服月球的目約有二：一是遠大的目的，即在萬一發生，「宇宙大戰」，地球上的人類和火星或金星上的人類發生戰爭時，月球可以作爲地球的前哨。第二種目的是眼前的，亦即科學上的發掘，例如在月球上發掘外鎮和其他未知的貴重物質。</p>
<p>「我們將在月球上發見些什麼東西呢？」要知答案，請讀下文。這是人類第一次的月球探險隊到達月球以後，在月球上第一天（等於地球上半個月）向地球所發送的兩週廣播報導，內容的一部是根據多種天文學名著寫成的。</p>
<h3>七月一日　氣溫　零下二百餘度</h3>
<p>各位聽衆！鄙人是美國空軍ＸＲ第七〇一號火箭駕駛員史密斯少校，正在從月球上廣播！不錯，我們已在一小時前平安到達此間，可是關於月球上面的情形，我們此刻所知道的正和你們在地球上所知道的沒有兩樣：我們現在只知道兩件事實：這裏很暗很冷。在夜間持續兩星期以後，氣溫降到了零下二百四十二度，我們靠了特製的保溫服裝得免於凍死。</p>
<p>乘我們在等待天明的當兒，且把我們的廣播程序報吿一下。我們探險隊裏而的科學家隊員，像物理學家兼輻射專家葛雷教授，繫生兼細菌學家鈍思博士，地質學家兼礦物學家社森等，將以所發見的作成報吿。我將逐日把我們的經歷和發見作概括的廣播，所有材料由各位科學家供紛。</p>
<p>自從你們幾百萬羣目送我們從亞利　那沙漠出發，一縷火焰向天空射去以後，大概是這樣的情形：</p>
<p>我們一直上昇，速度愈變愈高，直到電子速度指示器上指示着每秒鐘七英里的速度，我使把馬達關閉，於是我們便「靠岸」了。現在決沒有下墜的危險，這裏沒有地方可以下墜，我們已脫離地心吸力，孤獨地懸宕在太空的眞空中。</p>
<p>再前進幾千英里以後，開始下雨了，至少火箭外殼上淅瀝之聲很像雨聲。我在通訊機上談到這件事，只見杜森露齒而笑。他說：「不會的，我們此刻所在的地方，旣不會下雨下穴或下雹，也不會括風的……」</p>
<p>我私自默思着：「譚尼森坐在太空飛船裏」！</p>
<p>杜森說：「道是星塵，浮遊在太陽系周圍的宇宙質點。我們必須通過這種質點的雲層。」</p>
<p>「希望我們不要碰到像羅得島那樣大的質點，」火箭技士兼副機師李昂嚴肅地說，接着是悄然的沉默。</p>
<h3>解觸月球表面</h3>
<p>天空一片漆黑，點綴着像圓睜而不閃動的大眼睛的星星。沒有月亮。</p>
<p>沒有月亮……我們是向着無窮的空間，向着一個看不見的目標疾馳。這是依照原定的計劃。我們要在月球三百三十六小時的一天黎明以前到達月球，以便能充分利用白畫的時光從事我們的探險工作。在此後一百小時內，我們在火箭內除了注視着無數的儀器，懷着種種希望，和玩着紙牌戲以外，便沒有什麼事情可做了。</p>
<p>但是在最後兩小時內，我坐在機師座位衷，雙目可在儀器上面。其餘的隊員各自守在自己的崗位上，情緒異常緊張。……月球表面對於我們的高度測量器的反應如何，我們不十分確定。當儀器上指示着一千英里時，照我們的速度只賸二分鐘多些，我開始用反向火箭「殺車」。</p>
<p>在十秒鐘內，儀器上指示着我們正背離着月球進行。我急得汗流浹背，茫然不知所措。只見李昂冷笑地說：「月球的引力只有地球的六分之一」。我在緊張的情緒之下，竟通這僩也忘掉了，而發生地球人的反應。</p>
<p>我弛緩了反向火箭控制器，我們便慢慢地向下降落。七百英里……六百，五百……一百英里。我屏息地等着，默禱着。在通過廣大無垠的空間以後，我們的火箭終於徐徐地接觸了月球的表面。</p>
<p>每個人都舒了一口氣。我們互相帮忙穿起了那七百磅笨重的「月球服裝」，小心地跨出了火箭，等待天明。這是十分鐘以前的事。我們通過了火箭的雙重眞空門以後，我們就覺得輕鬆了許多，我們可以自由行動，但是不敢。我們不知道我們是否站在山谷的邊緣上，還是在五哩深的火山穴底部。</p>
<p>四周是漆黑一團，我們看不見什麼，也聽下見什麼。我們踡縮在火箭的旁邊，只過三十分鐘後便要天明了。　（下期續）</p>

<h3>留給下一代</h3>
<p>— 野草</p>
<p>觀抗敵文獻展覽後</p>
<p>漢奸家屬的生活費已經開始發還，接收舞弊的印象還零零碎碎地存在於人們心中，在目前，我們不能不强迫自已去承認這些已被成為事實的現實。</p>
<p>但是這種承認是够痛苦的。尤其在我們用自己的眼睛看了一决抗敵文獻展覽以後。</p>
<p>八年來的抗戰留下了這許多可歌可泣的文獻，這光榮是屬於無數敵前敵後捨身爲國的英雄。成仁的英雄把這份光榮遺留給我們，而我們却輕輕地淡忘了；那些以敵後幸得餘生的同志，又是瘡痍滿體，帶着以生命換來的軀體上的傷殘，這傷殘曾換取了民族的健康，但我們不都是又在紛擾的現實中忘記了他們？</p>
<p>對於蒙難同志會的這次抗敵文獻展覽我們受到了莫大的感動，每一個踏進市立博物館的人，都重溫了一次為解放我們自己而受着終身苦難的英雄們的面影。</p>
<p>姜夢麟先生的一只腎囊，劉志剛先生被注射毒素後週身的變形，充分說明了侵略者一種毫無掩飾的獸性，也說明了我們為爭取正義所付出的代價。姜劉二先生雖然失去了他們個人的健康，但還能够和我們一同生活在這自由的士地上，這是我們這一代人的最高榮譽。</p>
<p>范芸芳女士和她的事業——仙樂照相館，也替地下工作留下了不可磨滅的一頁，這一頁，將永遠照臨在這渾渾噩噩的都市底裏層，使千萬個徵歌逐酒的都市女兒景慕這崇高的榜樣！</p>
<p>平祖仁烈士終於離開我們了，多麼壯烈的安息！勝利是這樣地用鮮血塗成的，我們面對着照片上他那靜靜地躺着的遺體，應該有一個深刻的警悟！</p>
<p>祝福這些受苦難折磨的英雄！這一點燦爛的記憶我們將留給下一代！</p>
<h3>倒的故事</h3>
<p>— 樹勛</p>
<p>今天回家，太太臉色不大好看。心裏慌了：是不是下午跳茶舞給她探聽到了？自己的臉上也不免緊張，但不得不放鬆了面部的肌肉，輕輕地試探一下：</p>
<p>「為什麼不高興？小曼麗不聽話麼？那末一定是大官不肯溫課了。」我有點生氣了。太太本來太疼愛了小孩子，小孩們也太頑皮和荒唐了。</p>
<p>太太儘是搖頭，幷且眼圈兒有些潮潤。</p>
<p>一定是大官使媽媽受氣，因為只有他常常使媽媽氣得哭出來</p>
<p>「大官，來！」</p>
<p>我又想扮一份審判官的臨時角兒。</p>
<p>「不是的，不是的，不要斥責他，我難過。」</p>
<p>我更慌了。在這年頭兒，生病不是好玩的，診費，藥費，手術費，一下就是好幾百萬，我的天！但我不能不萬分的小心與關切；</p>
<p>「要不要請醫生？王醫生，是我幼年的同學，再，趙醫生是我公司裏的顧問，打電話去找他去。親愛的，到底那裏不舒服？」</p>
<p>「我對不起你，三弟倒了，人也找不到了！」太太終於哭起來。</p>
<p>我明白了，跳茶舞的事情她沒有知道，我心頭放下了一塊石子。</p>
<p>但是，三弟倒了！想起太太平日很能幹，能把一百萬借給人家，一個月收二十萬息貼補家用，她常常出去買東西。</p>
<p>「你瞧，我買了一件衣料，十萬另五千，便宜嗎？漂亮嗎？這是我賺來的錢。」每逢此種塲合，我總是讚她能幹，也唯有在此場合，她會快活得儼一只小鳥，笑起來如花枝招展，新婚時也沒有如此美麗。同時她也很驕傲，似乎說你還沒有像我這樣能幹，在我自卑的讚美的神態下，她益發高興得意，似乎比新婚時一步步踏入禮堂還來得……</p>
<p>然而今天，她垮了。好像一隻鳳，忽然斬去了美麗的尾巴，又好像是一枝花，一煞時萎落了</p>
<p>一眞想不到三弟也會倒！他平日省吃儉用，做事穩穩當當，從來也沒有說過一句謊話。」</p>
<p>太太抽噎着向我伸訴。</p>
<p>「有人要捉他報局。還是大哥不忍，吩咐查賬研究研究。原來他去年三月做生意虧了五百萬，為了要顧面子，不失信用，他就開始拆款過渡，從賬上看來，東的移，西去補，利息越高，負債額越大，為了要拆款，交際也忙起來了，為了要交際，塲面也大起來了，傷面一大，開支增加，手頭鬆動，家用也放實了，怪道三弟婦上個月買了一件皮大衣，小寶實又滿身是金飾品，原來都是用的別人的錢！」</p>
<p>「倒了多少？」</p>
<p>「結果一共虧空八千七百萬。」</p>
<p>「你的份兒？」</p>
<p>「我的五百萬都完了！」</p>
<p>妻哭得很傷心。</p>
<p>只覺得天在旋，地在轉。五百萬，五百萬，五百萬……</p>
<h3>「意見計」</h3>
<p>— 佳原</p>
<p>在龐大的會塲中舉行表決手續，實在是一件極麻煩的事情。人多手雜，計算起來容易發生錯誤，偶一不愼，就須從頭數起，浪費下少時間，面且對於會塲秩序也有不良影響。還有一點，一個人對於一個問題固然可以絕對的贊成或者絕對的反對，但是有時候也極可能部份贊成。例如百分之七十五贊成，百分之廿五反對。但在普通的會塲中是無法加以精密計算的。這一點，不能不說是一大缺陷。</p>
<p>但人終究是聰明的動物，到底發明了一種可以精密計算意見的工具了。這東西呌做「意見計一是美國通用電氣公司所設計的，可以記錄各種各樣的見解，自「百分之一贊成」至「百分之九十九贊成」，至於絕對贊成或絕對反對，那就更不成問題了。這機器一决可以託錄一百五十個下同的意見，每記錄一個意見平均需時十秒鐘，最後撥動機關，指針就可以告訴你準確的百分數，例如百分之五十三贊成之類，其精密程度，當非按手計算所能望其項背，在開會特別多的二十世紀，的確是極有用處的。（以上根據聯合社紐約電）</p>
<h3>安定第一</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>談勞資糾紛新花樣</p>
<p>自勝利以來，尤其在上海，勞資糾紛此起彼伏，層出不窮，當時，勞方對抗資方的武器，不外乎「懶工」，「怠工」，和「罷工」三種，但是，最近又因年賞問題而引起許多勞資糾紛，勞方對抗資方的新武器又增多二個，這二個的新名詞就是「愁工」和「慢工」。</p>
<p>「愁工」的創始者是南京路小呂宋百貨商塲，他們的職員在門口設一長方木牌，大書「愁工」二字，在商塲內部四壁以及玻璃櫃上，遍貼標語，說明舊曆年關將近，百物昂貴，日常生活所需，實非低微待遇可以負担，要求資方體念同人，發給雙薪，提高待遇，及從速發給應得公記金等。勞方因不欲使資方蒙受損失，仍照常營業，意思說，「愁工」僅為精神上之表示，這是一個新花樣，是消極的反抗表示。</p>
<p>至於「慢工」的創始者是法商電車，他們亦是為了年賞問題，實行「慢工」來作為反抗，所謂「慢工」，就是將行車的速度减低，與步行無異，譬如由善鐘路至外灘十六舖，竟需一小時又半，實在可以說已創車輛最慢速率之紀錄，意思說，使資方减少收入，這亦是一個「新花樣」。</p>
<p>我們看了上面的情形，就會感到這是勞資間的不幸，但是為什麼勞費間不能互想諒解？為什麼勞資間不能互相協調？雙方都難辭其咎。記得吳市長在去年曾經這樣說：「要吃蛋，就要保護母鷄」我們希望不管是母鷄，不管是蛋，從今以後，應互相愛護，目前中國，千言萬語一句話：「安定第一」，希望關於勞資糾紛的新名詞，亦至此吿終。</p>
<h3>「機會」瞬息即逝</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>有一句成語，說是「機會』會在每個人的門上敲一次的，但是，只敲一次。往往，牠敲門的聲音沒有被人家聽見，於是便成為遺憾。這裏，就是一些遺憾的故事。</p>
<p>欲找尋出來誰是借錢給勞勃。富爾頓而讓他發明汽船的人，那是一件非常困難的事，因為那個支持者懼怕自己的姓名因為贊助了這項計劃而受到人家的嘲笑，所以，他把姓名藏沒了。可是後來，汽船竟發明了，他郤還是一個不知何許人也。</p>
<p>當喬奇，偉司丁好斯，在一八七五年設計了一項蒸汽制輸器，他把計劃寄給萬德皮爾·那位鐵路界的要人，郤把偉司丁好斯的信退還了給他，並且在信箋下面註了一句話：「我沒有功夫去和愚笨的呆子瞎繼！」呆子嗎？哈，偉司丁好斯後來成為美國數一數二的發明家呢！</p>
<p>有一天，一個陌生人走到馬克·吐溢面前，向他商量五百元錢，他說情願以他的發明的一半利益抵償，作為那筆錢的代價。馬克吐溫「咬着嘴唇」考慮了許多時候，然後，斷然地決絕了，但是，為了禮貌上的關係，他詢問那陌生人的姓名。『倍爾，』那男人一面回答說，一面轉身走了，『我的名字呌亞力山大·葛辣亨姆·倍爾·』現在，誰都知道他就是電話的發明人。</p>
<p>曾經向福爾摩斯的作者（科南，道爾）去建議的人倒也不是一個陌生人，他是科南道爾劇本中的一個靑年演員，他提議從今以後和那作家的收入，大家不論多少，一齊放在一起互相平均分配，一直到死亡為止。道爾禁不住哈哈大笑了，『假使我不知道你是在開玩笑，』他說，「郤利。卓別林，對於你這瞻大妄為，旁若無人的冒昧建議，我早就把你開除掉了』。如今這位郤利·卓別林·却已就是大獨裁者的主角，獨一無二的滑稽電影明星。哈，還用說嗎？</p>

<h3>今日縣長</h3>
<p>— 若斯</p>
<p>今日當縣長，如非天才，決難辦事。民，財，建，敎，軍，法，糧，社，地……事事集於一身。如縣長為政務官，則各科科長當為事務官，庶可勉强辦理。可是今日的縣長大抵帶就一副班子，今年在甲縣做縣長，這幾個人跳，弄得不好，被地方一吿，坐立不穩了，明年到乙地做縣長，又是這副班子，也是這幾個人跳。這當然是中國政治奇蹟之一，但現在看來已見怪不怪。如果縣長不帶班子，光桿上任，迎接事也辦不來的。上司決然無好感，「嚇，這個人幹部也沒有。」班見並無大能耐。</p>
<p>有的縣長每月待遇不過九萬元，（信不信由你），秘書科長五六萬元。目前江蘇縣長待遇不過廿多萬元，上海一個黃包車夫比他强得　可是事體樣樣辦，地方吵架，軍隊要米，抽丁派伕，如認眞去做，則一天忙到晚，每天廿四小時嫌太少。可見縣政府辦公費只有幾十萬元。這個數目用來打電報好呢，還是用來吃點心？筆墨紙張，姑毋論矣。</p>
<p>錢要用，只好東移西挪，如縣長問心無愧，也是查賬不得。縣參議會大權在握，倘板起面孔來查，就不堪設想。預算經費，特支項下，都要通過參議會，可是參議會也不見得理想得很，縣長偶一敷衍不好，遂頗糟糕，可能百事推不動，只好捲舖蓋走路。想有些設施，大刀闊斧幹也不行，因為牽制太多，要「獨裁」不行，求「民主」也像不大通。</p>
<p>某縣長製「縣長論則」四條吿我：</p>
<p>用之若聖賢；</p>
<p>驅之若牛馬；</p>
<p>棄之若敝屣；</p>
<p>防之若盜賊。</p>
<p>可為今日縣長寫照。事實上要當縣長而不得的又大有人在。對地方行政有濃厚興趣嗎？倒也並不見得。有些縣長要靠特別關係才撑得住，百事包拍胸脯。今日政事不上軌道，人浮於事，縣長到任，介紹職員履歷片一大堆，說沒有人去辦縣政嗎，又不盡然。縣長的頭是夾得扁的，就在看各人的手段，</p>
<p>有一個老班子，有人拍胸脯，則縣長越做越老，越做越易做，甚至無為而治，閉着眼睛也好辦事了，倒又不見得要什麼天才。</p>
<h3>滅火器的種種</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>火，與水一樣，能為利於人類，也會為害於人類。我們利用着火，也為着失火而發愁。自古以來，人類滅火的武器，一直是水。現在，雖然救火車改善了，唧筒發明了，但是滅火的主要武器還是水。</p>
<p>普通的滅火的設備有許多缺憾，對於發生高熱的失火的事物，根本不能接近，使之熄滅。但是聰明的人類豈能束手無策的任火神猖獗？有一些新的滅火的武器已經發明了。這裏介紹三種於讀者：</p>
<p>第一種是無色的，化學性質不活發的二氧化碳，我們呼吸時呼出的氣體就是它。舊式的二氧化碳滅火機是利用碳酸氣納與硫酸化合而放出氣體的二氧化碳。新式的二氣化碳滅火機則直接將液體的二氧化碳盛入高壓的固封的筒內。用的時候，將蓋揭開，於是筒內的壓力消失，二氧化碳便急噴而出，體積膨脹到五百倍，像寒零一樣的罩着火塲，溫度低至零下一百十度！雪狀的二氧化碳，隨即變成氣體，籠罩着火塲，使它與外界的氧氣隔絕，使它無法繼續燃燒。</p>
<p>另一種滅火新武器呌「覆火沬」。「環火沬」是一種膠黏的，海綿狀的泡沬，它是無往而不黏，甚至在豎直的玻璃片上，它也是穩黏不溜。無論何處失火，它都能將之撲滅，如同濕草包撲滅餘燼一般。</p>
<p>泡沬滅火的奇異的特點是：它並非是化學作用，而完全是機械作用。製造泡沫的液體通常是硫酸鋁或者一種秘密的製造醫酒的黃豆的製成品。這種「黃豆湯」與水和空氣混合後，用唧筒打出來，經過沒帶由尖管內噴射出來，便成了滅火的泡沫。「覆火沫」和二氧化碳一樣的無書。它對於衣服和人類的皮膚都是無損傷的，火滅之後，百分之九十的泡沬便也消失了。</p>
<p>現在有一種救火事，除了「覆火沬」和一具强力的唧筒之外不携帶其他滅火物。祗要混合一百加侖的水，它們便能製造一千加侖的泡沬。永噴射出來後，或是四流，或是被熱火蒸發，但是泡沫却緊黏在着火物上。所以在水源缺乏的傷所，「覆火水沬」，價値允大滅火武器是一水霧」，它不是什麼秘密的化學品製成的，僅不過是人類原始的滅火武器－水－被－裂而成的一道「霧牆」·一皮帶的水，經過一個特製的噴霧管便會被分成許多針形的噴射物。這些噴射物從皮帶的頂端流入時，便互相衝碰而再分成上億的微細的水的細點。這些水噴射出去便成功了一座滅火的「霧牆」。</p>
<p>「水霧」的滅火的原理很節單；無數的水點將火塲包圍後，便能吸收其中的熟度，使火塲的溫度降低，同時又將它從空氣的氧中隔絕開來，於是火神就束手被擒了。</p>
<p>「水霧」有許多優點：因為這霧牆是不導電的，所以當有高電壓的發電所失火時，救火負可以施放「水霧」趨近灌救，而無觸電喪生之慮·又因爲水的質點幾乎輕得沒有重量，所以對灌救失火的輪船特別有利。輪船失火，因船內載有航行用的燃料，加以船身被焚時發生高熱，所以施救非常困難。雖然水源不慮匱乏，但是船身裝滿了水，火雖然熄了，船也傾環了，去年紐約港口「諾曼底」大郵船失火，日以機夜的用水灌救的結果，就使她傾覆了。但是如利用「水霧」灌救，便能免去這種弊害，戰爭時期，聯合國的大運輸船「曼漢坦」號失火，一發不可收拾，幸虧有「水霧」救急，噴射了三天，大火始滅，而船身僅有輕微傾斜，如以海水灌救，當時「曼漢坦」號恐早已被海龍王「拉差』拉去了。</p>

<h3>從憤怒的葡萄看美國</h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>近十年來的美國小說界是海明威，沙洛揚和史丹培克三個人的世界。海明威的技巧平常，只是用新奇的題材去吸引讀者，至於「戰地鐘聲」，生活體騐得太不够，形象化這一點都沒有能做到，只有庸俗的小市民去欣賞，原談不上文學。沙洛揚的語彙太貧乏，不能把握個性比較複雜的人物和偉大的塲面，史丹培克則用他强有力的筆觸刻畫了美國人民生活的眞實，「人鼠之間」是一部不朽的佳作，而「憤怒的葡萄」底藝術價値和社會價値更達到了一個高峯的頂端。</p>
<p>中國的智識份子對於美國的看法有一個傾向，往往把自己的希望都寄托在美國，彷彿在那裏遍地都是金條金塊股票債券，只等你去拾取，每一個都市和鄕村不分日夜地在舉行着盛大的鷄尾酒會，只等你去參加，每一個女性都像電影廣吿上所形容的那樣香艷熱情，只等你去接吻或擁抱，「憤怒的葡萄」是糾正這種傾向的一本好書。</p>
<p>在酷烈的太陽下面，俄克拉何馬的原野是枯瘠的，風不停地吹着，天空裏永遠飛揚着塵沙凝結着烟霧，枯瘠的原野分裂成無數不整齊的塊塊，塵沙一層層覆蓋下來，埋沒了那些本來就少得可憐而又飢渴得快要失去生命的植物，農民們頭上包紮了手帕，戴着防風沙的眼鏡辛勤地耕種這一塊土地，用他們的汗水和血液來灌溉這一塊土地，但是他們不能享有他們的收穫，因為這土地雖然是他們開墾出來的，但是荒年裏向銀行借過帳，土地的所有權已轉移給銀行了，如今必須文付一筆租稅給業主們，又因為一架曳行車就能代替十二三家農民的勞力，在這一種情形之下，勞力的供應成為多餘，「佃戶制度再也行不通了。」</p>
<p>現在農民必須離開這枯瘡的原野，他們到什麼地方去？他們今後怎探生活下去，銀行沒有功夫來管這些，銀行只要求它的利潤和利息。而加利福尼亞的地主們在東印度發散了許多傳單，說是他們需要很多的人工來摘葡萄或做其他工作，工資相當的優待，實際上呢？他們僅僅只需要少量的人工，而他們故意這樣宣傳，因爲供需律的作用，到加利福尼亞來求工作的人工愈多，他們愈可以降低工資，從另一方面說，他們可以獲得更多的利潤。</p>
<p>逃荒的人羣底洪流裏有的特他們一家子，他們買了一輛用過年限的卡車來做交通工具，載着他們道一家老少和日常應用的家其，把卡車裝得像一聽罐頭食物這樣滿滿的。他們幻覺中的加利福尼亞一切都是理想的，是人間世的伊甸園。老祖父說：「那邊滿限是葡萄，一路都有纍纍的葡萄宕在上頭，你猜我打算怎樣辦啦，我要把葡萄摘滿了一脚盆，自己坐在這中央挨磨，讓汁水浸透了我褲子。」母親說：「但是我少不得心裏想，加里福利亞的情形大的好得很，天氣永下冷，到處是水菓，人們住着摘樹樹叢裏的小巧的白房子，如心如意的地方。」</p>
<p>死亡和逃荒永遠是親密的孿生兄弟，在的特一家的旅程裏最先死去的祖父，本來常動身的時候，他就捨不得離開自己的故鄉，他們把他用藥酒灌醉了抬上卡車的，呌一個老年人遠離他所生長的土地，已經够使他的精神痛楚了，再加上旅途的辛苦，急性中風就結束了他的生命。在越過沙漠以前祖母又病死了，為了要大家早些脫離亢旱的沙漢，母親始終把祖母病死的消息保守秘密，和祖母冰冷的屍體在一起睡了一整夜，卡車到達大平原的時候才公開出來，另一件使人心頭蒙上一層暗影的事是大兒子諾亞在中途的走散，他獨自一個人去和生活門爭去了。</p>
<p>他們到達加利福尼亞境內以後，所儲藏的一些錢，已經用得乾乾淨凈了，工作仍舊找不到，而那汚穢的霍佛微爾的停置塲也不讓他們停留下去，警察三天兩頭來找麻煩，後來在靑草地收容所裏好容易找到地方安居下來，這裏是貧窮的羣衆，組織很嚴密，設備也齊全，過着有規律的自治生活，然而工作問題不能解决，只得離開道理想的生活環境到一個農塲去採桃子，所得的工資少得可憐，因為托謨打壞了一個人，怕惹出大亂子，這一家人又坐着破爛的卡市到另一個地方去採棉花，在那裏他們又遭遇了洪水，奪去了他們可憐的財物，威脅着們可憐的生命……</p>
<p>我想從「憤怒的葡萄」來說明一下美國社會的現狀：</p>
<p>一，美國的地主和資本家已經發現要獲得更多的利潤，不一定用增加資本擴充市塲的方法，控制勞工和市塲，就能達到目的，「美國六十家」這一本书叙述了各企業托拉斯化的趨向，又分析了每一個托拉斯的政治背景，很能帮助我們理解「憤怒的葡萄」。地主和資本家控制勞工和市塲的結果，勞工為了生活的逼迫，只得接受最低的工資，結果仍然不能維持生活。</p>
<p>二，華盛頓的革命理想和材肯所憧憬的，Of　the　people　Ｆor　the　people　By　people到現在為至然沒有能完全兌現，美國式的民主雖然給予每一個國民以有限的言論自由，但是不能保證他們不受飢餓。在美國一切自由財貨由於高度資本化的原因都轉變成經濟財貨了，於是貧民的生活空間變得異常窄狹，在停車塲上停一夜車就得付出一筆可觀的租金，和警察爭論幾句，亂黨的帽子就加到頭上來，我們認爲美國政府進步速度還太遲緩，應該多多注意地主资三家以外的人民。</p>
<p>三，誠然近代歐美文明的泉源是希臘思想和希伯來思想，誠然近代歐美人士的精神生活和敎會不能分開，但是一般人的宗敎信仰的變質是一個事實，在「憤怒的葡萄」裏面的牧師起初對於祈禱的效力發生懷疑，最後乾脆不幹牧師了，這很能說明美國年靑的一代對待宗敎的。</p>
<p>四，除了市儈階層，美國人都是歡迎賓客的，一個陌生人在異鄕旅行，隨處都會受到熱烈的款待和親切的招呼，使你恍如置身家園，這是因為人口過份集中都市，林野生活太孤寂的綠故。因此，像的特他們这樣貧窮的家庭依然用最寳貴的食物來款待下速之客。眞眞的美國人民是可愛的，我們應該同情的。</p>
<p>讀完了道一本書，我們會體味出史丹培克的憤怒的情緒，而我們自己，也下禁憤怒起來了。</p>
<h3>山谷</h3>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>我早就渴望着想來這裏唱支歌，沿着穿流在這個山谷裏曲折的溪畔口里很荒凉，但一‘切都呈顯得這樣幽靜可愛，像玫瑰色的夢般綺·很久很久；我就渴望着想來這裏描繪一幅不用彩色的畫。</p>
<p>這裏有：飛島微幅的翱翔，小溪汨汨的歌唱，野花芬芳撲鼻，牧笛高吭的滾響在山坡上。…</p>
<p>雖然是個濃霧濛茫的黎明，蒼翠茂密的林子里已響着可可的伐木聲了。炊烟也裊裊上升起來了。勞働的人民也已跨出低矮陰濕的門檻到田野間去工作了。誰還願留戀於長夜凄苦的夢呢！</p>
<p>於是溪邊盪漾着村姑底銀鈴的笑聲，原野騰起粗獷的牧歌，沉寂的山谷隨即響起奔赴遠方旅人底急促的脚步。</p>

<p>還有一個人却也不能不見一面：誰？就是那位第五縱隊的特務領袖，獨眼紳士沙登。他的事很忙，不一定常在近衛身邊。要是凑巧在這裏，却也是個大大的辣手傢伙，因為他比日本一切矮疙瘩的腦筋却要靈活些；也許他在一旁，冷眼旁觀，說不定就可把鶴見的計劃，一下戳破。要是他在別府的話，鷄見必得跟他打個照面：打這照面的意義，上海話就呌「別苗頭」。當然見面第一句，開宗明議，就得吿訴他「這是敝國『自己人』鬧意見的小玩意，貴賓不必插手，否則必要討個大大的沒趣」。沙登要是識趣，各自避開，鶴見也不見得定要給他下不去。萬一沙登定要鬥個明白，鶴見早有佈置，一致示會給他拾着便宜的哩。</p>
<p>會見這幾個人，在文字上費了偌大篇幅，在實際上，要是順利的話，也就是這麼三五六分鐘的事：就令不大順手，殺砍起來，也花不了多大時間，因為明的暗的，都已早有佈置哩。照原定計劃，除非萬不得己，眞要大事殺砍，才有割斷電燈電話等等，斷絕別府外援的舉動。然而這時鶴見還只剛剛抓到一把刀，並沒碰見一個人，爲何就把電燈熄了？所以連鶴見本人，竟也莫明其妙了。</p>
<p>鶴見看見情形起了變化，知道不妙，但無論如何，總得探詢一個道理出來。他念念不忘的，當然是那個地下室，料想自己的人，凡是担任重要工作的，必在那一個地區　，要是這時發生意外變化，猜想起來，必也發生在那個地區以內。果然，等他跑到甬道轉灣盡頭的地方，乍一拉開那扇小間，就聽見叮叮噹噹刀劈劍砍的聲音。側耳靜聽了一下，要探明這激鬥的方向，所在；無奈這裏重門疊戶，高培矮垣，回聲激蕩，竟不能斷定這廝殺聲響的來源。</p>
<p>這時不由得鶴見不焦躁，因爲步　已經亂了。他也顧不了許多了，便徑直搶近衛那座東洋式的大聽內。</p>
<p>「哼…轟急糾舉…？」廳內裏地有，這麼吆喝了一聲，「呟」，是日本武　開口的先道詞，大概是倣效虎嘯獅吼發的聲響；同時，憑這一哼，暗含著先聲　人的嚴重意義。可就是一件，日本人的　天缺陷太大，鼻音毛病太重，　將起來，竟有些不　老虎和獅子。黑龍會的暗誠，不是「恐急糾舉」嗎？為什麼這專是「轟」？那也是由於鼻音太重或喉音　　　究。</p>
<h3>陌生人</h3>
<p>— 蘇·李比節夫作　李黎譯</p>
<p>這是夏天的一個早晨，我背着漁竿，到我熟習而歡喜的，距鎭上約有兩俄里的地方去釣魚。在這裏我碰見了一位我從未見過的人。</p>
<p>「我常常來這兒釣魚，請您原諒，我想靠着您找個地方坐坐，」—我對那陌生人講。</p>
<p>「這是怎麼說，假如您需要我這塊地方，我可以讓您！」他回答着。</p>
<p>「請坐，請坐，您沒有佔住我的地方。您來了很久吧」！</p>
<p>「是的，快一個鐘顯了。』</p>
<p>「有什麼收擭嗎？」</p>
<p>「什麼都沒有！」</p>
<p>我拋出釣竿後，開始審視我的鄰坐，他約有四十來歲，長着灰白髴，沒有修剃的下額，污　的帶着花邊的帽子，油膩的　綫內衣，披着一件汚髒的而補了補釘的皮外套，脚上穿一雙破爛歪斜的長統靴。－所有這些，給與了我一個大概的印象；我的鄰坐是一個窮困的酒鬼。</p>
<p>我們靜坐了將近一個鐘頭，沒有互相說一句話。這時我已經釣了幾條　魚和鯉魚。</p>
<p>「咿：什麼鬼氣？」－我的鄰坐終於開始說話了。－「我來了快兩個鐘頭，祗來啄過一次餌兒，您還在我後來，幾條魚都被您「强釣了去」。」</p>
<p>一假如您想要的話，我可以把魚送給您。」我隨便地說了一句。</p>
<p>「這是怎麼講的？請你原諒我，我是從不納受別人的施捨的，別看我是一個衣衫襤褸的窮鬼…」</p>
<p>「這對不起，實在我全沒有想到我是施捨。」我急忙地解釋着。「我之所以想把魚送給您，祗是它對於我是一件不需要的東西而已。」</p>
<p>我們倆又沉寂了幾分鐘。</p>
<p>「您時常來釣魚嗎？」我打破了沉寂。</p>
<p>「時常，您呢？」</p>
<p>「我在夏天每一個例假的日子，差不多都來，這是一個很好的消遣。」</p>
<p>「您是做哪一行業的？」我繼續地問。</p>
<p>「我……我……我就是這樣的我呀！」</p>
<p>「就是這樣的我，這是什麼意思？」</p>
<p>「這很簡單，……就是，不是任何一個旁人。」</p>
<p>「我還是不滿您的意思。」</p>
<p>鄰坐這樣有趣的對我，我已經忘記了飄在水面上的浮子。</p>
<p>「沙皇時代，我是一個縣衙門的書記，可是工作非常繁重，收人又有限，我就辭退了，現在我是一隻自由鳥兒樣的人了，我可以隨意所欲的到天涯海角去…」</p>
<p>「您再沒有託人帮您找職業了？」</p>
<p>「唉！落泊囑！他們都說我是「反對者」。」妥協者」。」</p>
<p>「這又是什麼意思？」</p>
<p>「反對者」和「妥協者」這就是說我是一個危險份子。」</p>
<p>「您現在住在哪裹呢？」</p>
<p>怪人用脚尖在地上點點。</p>
<p>「就在這塊同您在一塊兒的土地上……」</p>
<p>「有些人呌我是浪蕩鬼，有些人呌我是漂泊王，還有人呌我是窮光棍，這三個請您任擇一個吧！」</p>
<p>「唉，就這樣已很久囑！再多的東西，我都是不要的了。他提起一隻大的鯉魚，感慨地說：「好鯉魚，我的可愛的鯉魚，你對我表示出熱烈的親切，你給了我無限的溫暖……</p>
<p>他說完了道些話，把鯉魚擲在我的脚旁，拿起目己的釣竿，沿着河岸，很快的走了。</p>
<p>「再見了，朋友！」他離我有五十碼遠的樣子，喊着。</p>
<p>過了幾分鐘，怪人又轉來了，拿他忘記了帽子，帽子拿到手裏，他又嘻笑地說：</p>
<p>「明天您可以借給我三十個戈貝嗎？』</p>
<p>「您有急用嗎？」</p>
<p>「為了半杯老酒的酒癮在作祟。」——他微笑着。</p>
<p>我掏出了錢袋。</p>
<p>「魚您也可以拿出。」我把魚遞給他。</p>
<p>「謝謝您，這個不必了，為了您的健康，我不再打擾您了。」</p>
<p>我拿起錢袋和魚簍，他已很匆忙地在我的視錢中消失了。</p>

<h3>Government Officials Gather in Beijing to Discuss Peace, New Proposal Being Drafted, Content Includes Military and Political Themes</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Ten key government officials involved in peace negotiations, including Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Lei Zhizhong, Yu Dawei, Chen Lifu, Lei Zhen, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, and Wu Dingchang, convened a meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 4 PM on the 14th, adjourning at 7 PM. According to sources, since the government convened the National Assembly and formulated the constitution based on the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) resolution, and scheduled constitutional governance to commence on December 25th of this year,</p>
<p>numerous important matters still require resolution during this period. Therefore, it was decided to invite the Communist Party again to discuss national affairs. The meeting on the 14th focused on studying a peace proposal, with content covering two aspects: In military affairs, seeking a rational solution based on the military reorganization plan. In political affairs, inviting the Communist Party to participate in the government and discussing the resolution of local government issues. As for the two demands of the Communist Party, they were not considered. This meeting may continue for two or three days. Once the peace proposal is drafted, it will be reported to Chairman Chiang for approval before being presented to the Communist Party. The format for resuming peace talks, whether a round table conference or sending representatives to Yan'an, has not been decided and will depend on the Communist Party's preference. The source expressed the hope that the Communist Party would prioritize the nation, allowing the door to peace to be reopened.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After government officials held an important meeting on the afternoon of the 14th, reporters visited Sun Ke to inquire about his views on peace talks. He stated that the government is making "every effort within its power" to break the deadlock, and a new proposal is being drafted, but it is not yet finalized. When asked if it includes the past eight points, Sun replied, "The past is not being discussed." When asked if the "two points of the CCP are being considered," Sun did not give a definitive answer. When asked whether direct negotiations or a round table conference would be held, Sun replied, "Whichever is convenient, whichever is possible." He also indicated that a round table conference is different from the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) because the former has no binding force.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] President Sun stated: The only crucial task at present is to restore peace, and to restore peace, we must first resume peace talks. The possible ways to restore peace talks are direct negotiations, but direct negotiations seem difficult to initiate at present, so I propose convening a round table conference, inviting all relevant parties to participate. As for the content of the peace talks, it should focus on: (1) restoring transportation, (2) implementing reorganization. Other issues can easily find solutions. Sun then recalled the efforts made for peace over the past year, believing that good opportunities have been missed repeatedly. Today, the country is facing a serious crisis, and the people unanimously demand peace, believing that there should be full confidence and optimism in the future of peace.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Minister Zhang Lisheng stated: Government representatives gathered today and discussed the method of resuming peace talks for a long time. A decision has been made in principle. It is still unknown whether the CCP will accept this plan. Regarding the issue of government reorganization, the government is ready to reorganize at any time, regardless of before or after the resumption of peace talks.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Lei Zhen said on the morning of the 14th: The new peace proposal is being discussed by key government officials. The military reorganization plan, for which an agreement had been reached in the past, and the restoration of transportation plan, for which no agreement had been reached, are both important reference materials. The issue of local government is the main issue of the new proposal. In some aspects, the government will make as many concessions as possible within its capabilities.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] It is said that several political receptions will take place in Shanghai in the coming days. Sun Ke himself may go to Shanghai again on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Amidst the calls for the resumption of peace talks, all parties believe that the CCP's insistence on two demands is the biggest obstacle. The government has not yet considered them. American sources also said that these two demands are the two bolts on the door of peace talks. People in the capital who care about national affairs hope that the CCP will reconsider and not use these two demands, which deviate from the facts, as a prerequisite, which would affect the resumption of peace talks.</p>
<h3>Local Government and Military Region Issues, Government Willing to Make Reasonable Concessions, Rumors that the CCP Also No Longer Insists on Two Prerequisites</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Sun Baoyi, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, solemnly told reporters yesterday that the basic proposition of the Democratic Socialist Party regarding the current situation is that the resumption of peace talks must be conducted with sincerity, and one should not presume failure. Even if peace talks unfortunately fail, the government must first make various important reforms, such as improving financial and economic policies and ending political tutelage, before considering participating in the government. This basic policy has now received unanimous support within the party. Speaking of the concrete suggestions the government is about to put forward, Sun said: Lei Zhen indicated when he met with representatives of various parties in Shanghai that the government is willing to make reasonable concessions on local government and garrison areas. It was recently heard from Nanjing that the CCP no longer insists on two prerequisites, which, if true, would be good news. When the reporter asked why Zhang Qun had hoped that the Democratic Socialist Party would propose a plan for the current situation when he left Shanghai, but it was not ultimately proposed, he replied: There are two reasons: (1) A complete plan requires considerable time to solicit opinions from all parties behind closed doors, which may lead to impracticality. (2) The draft of the Democratic Socialist Party's plan differs greatly from the opinions of the Youth Party and still needs to be discussed and considered, so it could not be put forward immediately.</p>
<h3>Sun Baoyi to Go to the United States</h3>
<p>Also, Mr. Sun Baoyi is scheduled to go to the United States in February or March to reorganize the party's newspapers in the United States and seek the development of overseas party affairs for a period of one year. According to Mr. Sun; The World Daily in San Francisco, the party plans to increase the English version in the future for the reading of elderly overseas Chinese, Mr. Sun also intends to take advantage of the opportunity to go abroad to study political philosophy in the United States.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Zuo Shunsheng told reporters that, according to his personal observation, the formal reopening of peace talks is still difficult at present. There is no formal representative of the Youth Party in Beijing at present. He may go to Beijing in the short term because of the Senate, but it has nothing to do with the restoration of peace talks.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Visits Mausoleum</h3>
<p>And Meets with Wei Daoming, etc.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After Wei Daoming arrived in Beijing at 7 AM on the 14th, he visited Xiong Shihui at Bai Chongxi's residence at 10 AM, and then Gan Naiguang came to talk for a long time. It is likely that the topic was still Northeastern diplomacy. After Wei and Gan left, Xiong Shihui visited the mausoleum at 11:30 AM, and attended a banquet hosted by Zhu Jiahua at 6 PM.</p>
<h3>Detailed Rules for Amnesty Decree to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] After the National Government issued the amnesty decree, the detailed rules are being drafted and will be announced soon. It is heard that criminals sentenced to imprisonment of 15 years or less are expected to be pardoned.</p>
<h3>Marshal Ma's Mission Unfinished, Ambassador Will Continue to Carry It Out, Reports of Wedemeyer, Etc., Coming to China Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] An authoritative source close to the U.S. side told our reporter: Washington will not send any more military generals to China. The speculation about Wedemeyer and Li Hai are all unfounded. Ambassador Stuart will continue to carry out Marshal Ma's unfinished mission, striving to restore peace talks and promote their success. As for the way to reopen peace talks, all possible ways to achieve the goal of cooperation between the KMT and the CCP will be adopted and tested.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Ambassador Stuart hosted a banquet for Bai Chongxi at 7 PM on the 14th. Chen Lifu and Yu Dawei also engaged in "social" style conversation after the meal and dispersed late at night.</p>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 14th] After reporting on his work in Beijing, Xiong Shihui will return to Jiangxi. Xiong's friends are preparing a welcome. Huang Guangdou, who is in Jiyang, will also return to Jiangxi to handle personal affairs before going to the Northeast to assist Gong Xuesui in assisting with the Dalian municipal administration.</p>
<h3>Society for International Relations</h3>
<p>Elects Song Ziwen, Etc., as Directors</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Society for International Relations, initiated by diplomatic circles and famous scholars, held its inaugural meeting at 3:30 PM on the 14th, with over 200 members attending. Shao Fangzi presided and delivered a speech, stating briefly: Living in today's world, from politics and economy to daily life, is influenced by international relations. It is a mistake not to care about international relations. It is also a mistake to only know how to value international relations without in-depth research and to easily follow others, resulting in the abuse of the times. The purpose of the establishment of the Society for International Relations is to arouse public attention to international relations and further conduct practical research. Initiator He Fengshan delivered a speech, emphasizing that countries cannot be isolated in the future, and mutual understanding between countries is the foundation of diplomatic relations. After speeches by Ma Xingye and Bai Chongxi, the meeting rules were discussed. The association's charter stipulates that the association aims to study international relations and promote and maintain international understanding and world peace, and engages in the following research: (1) international organizations and international political, economic, military, social, and cultural issues, (2) various issues of Sino-foreign relations, and (3) the diplomatic policies of various countries, especially focusing on the diplomatic policies that China should adopt. After passing the charter, Shao Lizi, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Bai Chongxi, Wang Shijie, Yu Hongjun, Chen Lifu, Gan Naiguang and other twenty-five people were elected as honorary directors, Song Ziwen, Yan Huiqing, Zhu Jiahua, Hu Shi, Zhou Gengsheng, Chen Guangfu, Wu Guozhen, He Fengshan, Li Weiguo and other thirty-one people were elected as directors, Liu Wendao, Chen Yuguang, Wu Yifang and other nine people were elected as supervisors.

<h3>Ping Mei Soldier Rape Case, Trial Scheduled for the 20th</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 14th] It is reported that the U.S. military court will try the case of the U.S. military rape of a Chinese female student at Peking University on the 20th. The U.S. side said that nine Chinese and foreign reporters have been approved by the authorities to attend the military court hearing. Nine Chinese citizens have also been approved by the authorities, one of whom is Ms. Shen's father, and the rest are Ms. Shen's legal advisors, Mayor He Siyuan and six female civil servants from the municipal government. In addition, nine U.S. military officers will also attend to maintain the balance of numbers between China and the United States. The U.S. side did not intend to hear the case during Lieutenant General Tenner's inspection in Peiping, so after Tenner returned to Hawaii on the 17th, the trial will be held on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Electoral Laws and Regulations Related to the Constitution, Legislative Yuan Establishes Special Committee to Draft, Chairman Orders Wang Chonghui to Draft the Initial Draft</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Sun Ke announced at the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 14th that, according to regulations, all electoral laws and regulations related to the constitution should be drafted within three months after the promulgation of the constitution. Now, there are only two and a half months left in the specified period, urging that this matter be actively carried out. All committee chairmen believe that the election law is important and very specialized and that a special committee should be set up to handle it. It was decided that the five committee chairmen and conveners of the Legislative Yuan would make a preliminary study of the organization and number of members of this special committee and make various necessary preparations so that when the newly added legislators joined, they could jointly promote it. It is heard that the number of members of the special committee will not be too large, possibly fifteen people, at most not more than thirty people, and one-third of the quota will be reserved for the newly added legislators. Regarding the issue of amending all current laws and regulations that conflict with the constitution, Sun also asked all committees to actively study them in order to make necessary revisions. Chen Changheng asked whether the organizational laws of the five Yuan should also be drafted at present, since the organization of the five Yuan will be different from the current structure after the new constitution is promulgated. Sun replied: The establishment of the new government may be around the end of the 36th year, and this work seems to be delayed slightly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to various electoral laws and regulations related to the constitution and recently ordered Wang Chonghui to draft an initial draft of the election law for reference by the Legislative Yuan when formulating laws. After receiving the order, Wang is collecting various relevant materials and inviting experts to help him carry out this important work.</p>

<h3>Legislative Principles Draft of the National Bank Law, Legislative Yuan Decides to Resubmit for Review, Mineral Tax Regulations Draft Amended and Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Legislative Yuan, which had been in recess for nearly two months, held its 312th meeting at 9:30 AM on the 14th to deal with backlog cases. More than 50 legislators attended, and President Sun presided. First, the legislative principles of the National Bank Law were discussed. Chen Changheng, chairman of the Finance Committee, explained the review process. Regarding the legislative principles of the Central Bank Law, Chen pointed out that, according to the new draft, the Central Bank is a bank of banks, subject to the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, and is responsible for assisting national finance and regulating national finance. The responsibility of finance is to regulate national finance, and its capital is all allocated by the national treasury, so that the Central Bank can become a "bank of banks" with completely national capital. At the same time, according to the legislative principles, the maximum amount of currency issued by the Central Bank should be decided by the Legislative Yuan, and its issuance should also be checked and announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Accounting. In addition, the principles also stipulate the businesses that the Central Bank shall not engage in. These are all progressive points. What should be discussed is how the directors and supervisors should be produced. According to the draft, the National Bank Association, agriculture, industry, labor, and commerce can each elect two directors, and the National Bank Association can also elect two supervisors, and the National Accountants Association can also elect one supervisor. There is a lot of disagreement from all sides on this point, and I hope to discuss it. Lou Tongsun spoke, believing that all parties attach great importance to the Bank Law. If new proposals are put forward to change the system, it may have an adverse impact on the market, and hoping that when discussing this issue, we can always remember that our work is to establish a solid foundation for the future financial system. President Sun Weifa spoke, disagreeing with the point that agricultural and industrial groups can elect directors and supervisors of the National Bank, repeatedly explaining that since the Central Bank is a national bank, the directors and supervisors should be produced by the government. Now it is stipulated that they should be elected by people's organizations, which is not in accordance with the law or reason. The reason is that the directors represent the shareholders' equity. Only those with equity can elect directors. Now that the capital of the Central Bank is all allocated by the national treasury, I don't know what the reason is to allow the above-mentioned groups to elect directors. Sun also cited the British and American banking systems as examples, explaining that this type of regulation is rare even in foreign countries. It is said that after the Bank of England was nationalized, the state has become a shareholder and director of the bank, which is designated by the government. After nomination by the Ministry of Finance, it is appointed by the British King, and there is no regulation that the public association can elect directors. Therefore, the directors and supervisors of the National Bank must be appointed by the government, and at most they are only nominated by the group and then decided by the government. Otherwise, the National Bank is no different from "Public Bank of National Groups", wouldn't it be a joke. Lou Tongsun spoke again, believing that the legislative principles do not explain the legal relationship between the China Jiaotong and Agricultural Banks and the Central Bank, and it seems that it should be included. Hong Ruizhao advocated that this case is of great importance and should not be taken lightly, and should be resubmitted for review, and suggested that the legislative principles should stipulate how the policies of the National Bank should be coordinated with the national financial and financial policies. At the same time, acts such as speculative profiteering by the National Bank should also be curbed. Hong pointed out that today's Central Bank appears in the speculative market as a speculative merchant, using speculative merchant methods to crack down on speculators, and everywhere appears as a bullish position in the gold policy, fighting with merchants, leading speculators into its trap. This approach, even if successful, is not enough to be a lesson, let alone to be proud of. If unfortunately it fails, may I ask where will the national interest and the people's livelihood be placed? Therefore, the future National Bank Law must restrict this.</p>
<h3>Recovering the Official Shares of the Small Four Banks is Also Decided to Resubmit for Review</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhaoyuan expressed his deep dissatisfaction with the current situation in China's banking industry, which is neither official nor commercial, pointing out that according to the world trend, the division between national banks and commercial banks is very clear. After the integration of the two, the abuses are very serious. At present, there is no need to continue to allow the small number of merchants in the national banks to get involved. Zhang continued to point out that although the number of official shares in the small four banks varies, the abuses caused by not being official or commercial should be eliminated. Because the official shares are mixed in the small four banks, all kinds of unnecessary disputes arise with commercial banks, and the losers are often commercial banks. Therefore, all official shares in the Zhāng small four banks should be withdrawn. Finally, it was decided that the draft of the legislative principles of the National Bank Law should be resubmitted for review, and the case of recovering the official shares of the small four banks should also be resubmitted for review.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing the Bank Law issue today, the Legislative Yuan also passed two important laws, one of which was to amend the draft of the Mineral Tax Regulations. The main point of the case was to reduce the tax rate of coal, gas, petroleum, iron and other materials related to industry and national daily necessities to 3%. Another important case was to amend the draft of the organizational regulations of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<h3>Timely Abandon Political Disputes, Resolve the Difficulties of Constitutional Governance, President Sun's Speech at the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] At noon on the 14th, the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan hosted a public banquet for President Sun at the Yuan. Sun delivered a speech, briefly stating: This Yuan has been established by Mr. Hu Zhantang from freedom for eighteen years, and I have been here for fourteen years. This is really a valuable time in a short life. Those who were in their thirties or forties at that time are now in their forties, fifties, or sixties. During this time, this Yuan completed the revision of the draft constitution, which has now been amended and passed by the National Assembly. The reason why we gave up insisting on the Five-Five Draft Constitution is the spirit of tolerance and respect for the wishes of others. Although the constitution has been promulgated, there are still practical difficulties in constitutional governance. Therefore, if political disputes are not abandoned in a timely manner, I am afraid that the day for constitutional governance next year will still not be able to be implemented.</p>

<h3>Communist Army of Northeast China Crosses the Songhua River for a Southern Offensive; Zhongchang Railway Bridge Destroyed Again</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 14th] After the Communist army destroyed the Zhongchang Railway's Zhongde Iron Bridge between Changchun and Songhua River again before dawn on the 12th, they built fortifications near the bridge to prevent railway workers from repairing it. On the afternoon of the 12th, the Communist army attacked from Weichun and retreated to Dehui. The bridge is located 97 kilometers north of Changchun and has two parallel bridges. The upstream bridge was built by Imperial Russia with nine spans, while the downstream bridge was built by the Japanese with fifteen spans, each approximately 300 meters long and 20 meters high. In late May, when the Communist army retreated north of the Songhua River from Changchun, both bridges were damaged in four spans. After the Zhongchang Railway employees repaired the breach with over 10,000 sleepers, it reopened to traffic. It is reported that the Communist army has now burned all the sleepers. According to the responsible person in charge of the railway engineering here, the bridge is the largest bridge between Changchun and Songhua, and the engineering work is huge.

<h3>The Closure Project Cannot be Delayed; The Closing Work Must be Completed in One Go During the Dry Season; Water Conservancy Authorities Express Opinions on the CCP's Protest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Kaifeng, 14th] After the news of the CCP's protest against the closing of the breach and the diversion of water, as well as their demand to stop, spread, it aroused a wave of anger among the 30 million people of Henan, especially the people in the Yellow River flood area. Our reporter paid a special visit to the person in charge of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to inquire about their opinions. They expressed the following: The Yellow River breach closure and levee restoration project is in response to the urgent demands of millions of victims in the flood area and is related to the fundamental plan for national reconstruction. Since the victory, the central government has ordered that efforts be accelerated to promote it. Not only are the people of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu eagerly awaiting it, but people at home and abroad are also paying close attention. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission's Breach Closure and Levee Restoration Engineering Bureau is currently working day and night to complete the joint observation work in one go during the dry season. Otherwise, if the major flood arrives this year, all the projects that have consumed infinite human and material resources in the past year will be threatened by floods. If there is an unforeseen event, who will be held responsible? Therefore, the key to the closure is to race against time. It is rumored that the CCP plans to build dams to block water and breach levees in the middle to continue flooding Hebei and Henan. Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the CCP, recently told reporters in Shanghai: "If the Water Conservancy Commission and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ignore the CCP's request and accelerate the closure, the local people will take self-defense and self-rescue actions." The claim of building dams and breaching levees is not without reason. If the people can build dams and breach levees, why not actively devote themselves to levee restoration work? The intention is incomprehensible. If this is the result of the CCP's leadership, it is very unwise. We sincerely hope that this is just a rumor and will not become a reality.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Proposals at the Work Relief Conference; Proposal to Adopt Agricultural and Industrial Materials Accepted; Egerton and Hopaum Fly to Beijing to See Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[This City News] Yesterday was the second day of the UNRRA Work Relief Conference. At 0900 hours, representatives from various member states attended as scheduled. Director Lu Guangjin presided over the meeting. First, the heads of various departments reported on the work of their respective departments, followed by representatives from various sub-bureaus who raised issues with the work. After a break, the financial group, general affairs group, and storage and transportation group of the General Office reported on the progress of their work. One opinion was that the greatest difficulty was the excessive transportation costs, which resulted in the financial group's funds being mostly used for transportation (it was reported that the average cost of transporting materials was 100,000 to 150,000), putting the staff in a difficult situation. This was one of the proposals. A suggestion was made on the spot whether one-tenth of the relief materials could be used as transportation expenses to reduce the burden on the Finance Department. In addition, it was proposed to make full use of agricultural and industrial materials as work relief, which was also accepted by the conference. The meeting continued at 1400 hours, and Mr. Smith, a representative of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, reported on the main policy of relief work and discussed it. Mr. Smith continued: The assistance and supply of work relief have gradually weakened due to the approaching end of the UNRRA and the General Office. We must make the most of the short time and small amount of materials, so as not to lose the greatest significance of work relief. The conference will continue today and will discuss more than one hundred proposals submitted by the conference in turn.</p>
<p>[Another message] Egerton, Director of the UNRRA Sub-Bureau, and Ho Shishu, Director of the General Office, flew to Beijing together yesterday morning to see Chairman Chiang and make some requests.

<h3>Date of Public Trial for Main Culprit of Wanbaoshan Incident Still Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 14th] It is reported that the date of the public trial for Hao Weide, the main culprit of the Wanbaoshan Incident, has not yet been determined. Since the local prosecutor's office prosecuted him for the crime of forming a gang to rob, the case is clearly within the scope of the amnesty decree according to the provisions of the amnesty decree. However, since the case involves collusion with foreigners to sell out rights and interests, the situation is different. If it constitutes the crime of internal disorder and external troubles under the criminal law and applies the Emergency Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, it cannot be pardoned. The Changchun District Court is currently investigating in many ways, and it has not yet been decided whether it can be handled as a robbery case.</p>

<h3>The Calmed Military Mediation Department Quietly Passes Its First Anniversary</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office] The first anniversary of the establishment of the Military Mediation Department quietly passed today. There were no gatherings, no ceremonies, and not even a single word of sentiment was expressed by the three committee members. Government committee member Zheng Jiemin said, "He completely forgot that today is the anniversary of its establishment." This day last year, when Mr. Zheng assumed office, he said to the surrounding reporters that he came by plane and hoped to return to Nanjing by train soon. In the past year, he has been to Nanjing several times, but he has not yet taken the Pingpu train once! Communist committee member Ye Jianying, upon seeing reporters today, immediately hung up a "no war" sign. His first and last sentence was: "I cannot say a single word today." The American old committee member, Robertson, could not withstand the torment and aged long ago. General Gillon had to come and take on this difficult task. He was also determined to be a golden man who kept his mouth shut, and preemptively instructed his staff to have reporters wishing to see General Gillon contact the press office. On this anniversary, the only noteworthy movement in the Executive Headquarters was that at around 3:30 PM, Gillon first visited Zheng Jiemin and spoke for about 20 minutes. Then, Ye Jianying visited Gillon and left after speaking for about 25 minutes. Ye said that it was just a conversation of a routine nature. In these days of mediating disputes amidst the flames of war, the three committee members often do not see each other for ten days or half a month, and it is simply rare to meet. The Military Mediation Department today is not what it was in the first half of last year. The Communist guards at the entrance have long been removed, and only government military police are aimlessly wandering around. The three-ring armbands issued last year, weathered by the year's wind and rain, now look like nothing. Although people still come and go in the corridors of the building, they all lack tension and vitality. The rhythm of the typewriters in the offices is also slower and more subdued than before. The tents of radio stations used by teams spread throughout the country to communicate news, which used to be all over the courtyard, have long been completely dismantled. The leaves of the rows of willows all fell off last spring, and not even a single new bud can be seen on the bare branches. Apart from this desolation and loneliness, the Military Mediation Department spends more than one billion yuan on meals and heating alone each month, costing every Chinese person two yuan! Bao Wen, the head of affairs at the Peking Union Medical College, the landlord of the Military Mediation Department, is a very good old man. He did not complain that the ineffective Military Mediation Department was delaying the college's recovery. He said that the American side had made the greatest effort for peace in China, and he welcomed the Military Mediation Department to continue working for peace in China at their hospital.</p>

<h3>After the Municipal Council Adjourns</h3>
<p>The second general meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council opened on the 6th. The original agenda was for one week, but because there were so many proposals that could not be fully discussed, it was decided to extend the meeting by one day. Then, in order to carefully review the municipal government's financial budget proposal for the 36th year, it was decided to temporarily adjourn the meeting until early February for a general meeting to discuss it. During this adjournment period, the budget proposal will be submitted to the Finance, Budget and Regulations Committees for review. Therefore, starting yesterday, after the Municipal Council completed its eighth meeting, it temporarily adjourned, and its agenda came to an end.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council is a body of public opinion that emerged in Shanghai after the restoration. It was established in August of last year and held its first general meeting. The second general meeting was held on January 6th of this year. Looking back, although the resolutions passed by the first general meeting have been gradually implemented by the municipal government, they may not be able to fully satisfy the Council. Therefore, in his opening speech at the second general meeting, Speaker Pan had to say, "I hope that all colleagues, representing the opinions of all parties, must consider the burden on the citizens on the one hand, and understand the difficulties of the municipal government's administration on the other hand, and fulfill the responsibilities that representatives should fulfill in this general meeting." Councillors are situated between the citizens and the municipal government, and inevitably find themselves in a difficult situation. During the eight days of the meeting, we heard a lot of debate within the meeting, and at the same time, we saw the disturbances outside the meeting. Although it can be seen as a manifestation of the spirit of democracy, it is also sufficient to prove the difficulty of the current situation in Shanghai. If the municipal authorities cannot have a broad vision and strive for innovation, it will be difficult to produce good political achievements for a while.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the first trading port in our country and the cultural center of the country. The large population and the prosperity of industry and commerce are above other cities and provinces, and it is also the focus of Chinese and foreign attention. Therefore, the reform of Shanghai's municipal administration is urgently needed and cannot be delayed. However, what is the objective environment like? It makes it almost impossible to reform municipal administration. Shanghai has been gloriously recovered for a year and a half, but affected by the domestic situation, it has not only failed to achieve the goal of prospering Shanghai, but even stability is out of the question. Take the hawker problem as an example, which caused a great uproar. In December of last year, the wild rise and fall of gold notes caused a financial turmoil. This year, major manufacturers in this city have successively experienced labor unrest due to the year-end bonus issue. One after another, problems have emerged endlessly. Other problems such as the bankruptcy of national industries, the price issue, the housing shortage issue, and the electricity saving issue... all show the difficulties of the people's livelihood and the unrest in society. However, these problems cannot be solely blamed on the municipal authorities, nor can they be solved by the Municipal Council. To be honest, is not all this caused by the influence of the overall domestic situation?</p>
<p>At present, the overall domestic situation is too dangerous. If domestic wars do not stop for a day, domestic transportation cannot be restored for a day, and goods cannot flow smoothly. Not only is it impossible to start production and construction, but the price problem cannot be fundamentally solved. As a result, Shanghai has become an abnormal city. On the one hand, the surge in population and massive consumption have created superficial prosperity; on the other hand, due to the influence of the overall situation, industry and commerce are in recession, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and those with jobs also feel the hardship of life. Therefore, superficial prosperity and the hardship of the people's livelihood have become an ironic contrast in Shanghai. In addition, Shanghai's municipal administration is extremely complex, and any reform is "impossible without money"; and the economic capacity of Shanghai citizens is very limited, and they are already overwhelmed by the budget proposal put forward by the municipal government. Therefore, if we analyze the current environment in Shanghai calmly, we are unwilling to criticize the past municipal facilities, and even if we want to talk more about the things that should be done and reformed in the future, we are really unwilling to say more.</p>
<p>At this meeting, the Municipal Council raised many questions about the police, health, education, society, public utilities, public works, finance, and land administration, which was quite verbose. As representatives of the citizens, it was their duty, which should not be criticized; however, we believe that these are all passive in nature and can only vent the accumulated grievances of the people; and they still lack the power to promote the reform of Shanghai's municipal administration. We believe that the Municipal Council should put forward more constructive opinions on the future municipal administration. In fact, the demands of the four million citizens of Shanghai today on the municipal authorities are very simple. In a word, it is to build a stable and prosperous Shanghai. However, in the current environment, if the municipal government wants to meet the people's requirements and make their expected stable and prosperous Shanghai a reality, there are also two prerequisite fundamental issues:</p>
<p>The first is how to establish a good social atmosphere? Everyone knows that Shanghai's social atmosphere is extravagant, decadent, and licentious to the extreme. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly mentioned this in his instructions to the Shanghai municipal government. We have studied that the formation of this atmosphere was left over from the "concession era" and must not be allowed to exist in today's Shanghai society. But how can we change customs and make Shanghai's social landscape new? We believe that it should start with the municipal government independently establishing a good political atmosphere. All the civil servants of the municipal government cannot be generally referred to as "no official is not corrupt", but there is indeed a small number of people who, after coming to this ten-mile foreign land of Shanghai, cannot resist the temptation of pleasure and are assimilated by the social atmosphere and live their extravagant and licentious lives. The cases of seeking personal gain and engaging in malpractice that occurred during the term of the previous mayor have now been exposed one after another, which is really the most shameful stain in the history of Shanghai's municipal administration. Therefore, we hope that the current mayor can accept our opinions with the attitude of "correcting if you have mistakes, and making efforts if you don't", and that the transformation of Shanghai's decadent social atmosphere should start with the municipal government establishing a good political atmosphere.</p>
<p>The second is how to prosper industry and commerce? This issue is certainly related to the rise and fall of our national industries, and it should fall within the scope of the national economic policy. However, every time we meet a friend in the industrial and commercial circles and talk about the future of China's industry and commerce, they all shake their heads and sigh, and unanimously believe that taxes are too heavy and unbearable, making it impossible for industry and commerce to revitalize. We read in the newspaper that the budget proposal submitted by the mayor to the Municipal Council totaled 33 million yuan, and each citizen had to bear an average of 60,000 yuan, which cannot but be said to be too heavy. Shanghai is the center of China's industry and commerce, and its rise and fall are greatly related to the development of China's economy. We have to speak out loudly to the municipal authorities on behalf of the industrial and commercial circles and ask them to reduce the burden on the people, and never "drain the pond to catch fish", so that industry and commerce cannot exist at all. As for the income of the municipal government, it should give priority to solid things and reorganize tax collection, which can also increase income. As for expenditures, although it cannot live within its means, it should also give priority to austerity. At present, the structure of the municipal government is also too large.</p>
<p>In short, the Municipal Council has now adjourned. The municipal authorities should immediately and earnestly implement the resolutions passed in the eight days to show that Shanghai's municipal administration has been able to achieve true democratization. Since Mayor Wu also knows that "the 36th year of the Republic of China will be the most difficult and arduous year in Shanghai's history", he should also know that any reform and all implementation must focus on stabilizing society and prospering industry and commerce. Conversely, the municipal administration that is related to these two should be postponed in this difficult year. As for such a huge budget issue, the most attention of the Council is still on whether the people's economic capacity can bear this burden! Fortunately, it has not yet been passed and is still under review by various subcommittees. All four million citizens of Shanghai are holding 120,000 points of enthusiasm for the Council's review of the budget proposal. Whether the councillors can truly represent public opinion is a major test facing all the councillors!</p>

<h3>Yuyao Salt Price Turmoil: Ox Carts Follow Up With A Strike</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Yuyao Office] After the current increase in salt funds in the Andong Salt Yard in this county, the wave of salt farmers demanding supplementary salt funds has now spread to the ox cart industry. According to salt yard merchants, salt is distributed and transported out. Whether it is inland river or offshore, it must be transported by ox cart to the river port. Therefore, the ox cart is the only means of transportation for the salt yard. There are more than 300 ox carts on each road, and most of the car drivers are salt farmers who also work as car drivers. Now, because the car drivers' request to the authorities to increase the cart price has been rejected, all the car drivers have gone on strike in response since the 7th of this month, causing salt transportation to be suspended and the salt yard to become more chaotic.</p>

<h3>Bengbu Merchants Close Down One After Another</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Bengbu Office] As the Lunar New Year's Eve approaches, the market is becoming more sluggish. Under the shadow of recession, the wind of closure is swirling. According to a survey by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, another 27 businesses announced their closure in December of last year due to financial stagnation and inability to make ends meet. They include department stores, dried and fresh goods, leather factories, silver shops, Huai salt, oil and wine, grain shops, tobacco merchants, tobacco silk, and native cloth, one each; rattan bag industry, two; waterway transportation, two; miscellaneous goods, three; restaurants, two; and timber trade, six. The largest number of closures is in the timber industry, mostly due to tight credit and inability to survive the New Year's Eve under high interest rates. Since the beginning of the month, Fucheng Money Shop announced its closure on the 4th due to insufficient chips. Although the industry has tried to help, there is no hope of resuming operations. In order to curb high interest rates, the municipal government has strictly banned underground money shops. Tongyu Money Shop was found to be operating without the approval of the Ministry of Finance and was ordered to cease operations on the 9th, with a deadline of 10 days to complete liquidation and fined 500,000 yuan as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>As Lunar New Year Approaches, Huaiyin Urgently Distributes Relief</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Huaiyin Office] The recovery of Huaiyin has brought about popular suffering. As the Lunar New Year approaches, prices have doubled, and the general poor people feel even more embarrassed. Mr. Wang Shuxiang, as chairman of the Relief Association, has an inescapable responsibility. He specially convened a temporary conference on the afternoon of the 9th to discuss emergency relief measures. Bian Jinqian, Commissioner of the Huaiyin Office of the Jiangsu-Ningxia Branch Office, attended and reported that the relief materials for the entire Huaiyin County included 800 bags of rice, 30,000 sets of cotton clothes, and 20,000 yuan in cash, ready for distribution. However, because Director Zhang's communication is very cautious and he dare not entrust it to others to avoid abuses, the internal personnel of the office are not numbered and allocated, resulting in the inability to seize the time, which is considered slow. County Magistrate Huang Jiaju said that Director Zhang is realistic and his good intentions are deeply admirable. However, in the middle of winter, cotton clothes should be issued to the poor disaster victims as soon as possible to keep them warm, otherwise, spring breeze warmth cotton clothes will not be suitable for needs and will lose the meaning of relief. He is willing to do his best to assist. Wang Shifu, a representative of the Chamber of Commerce, also expressed his willingness to mobilize all the cloth industry merchants to cut and measure the clothing materials. After discussion, it was decided that in addition to the distribution amount of the Relief Office, a portion of rice or flour and bean flour would be allocated for an emergency relief in the seven townships in the urban area recently to help the poor people spend the New Year. The distribution procedures should be as simple, rapid, and effective as possible. It was stipulated that the Association should send four people, the Chamber of Commerce should send three people, the County Government should send seven people, the Party Headquarters should send one person, the Youth League should send four people, and the Township Office should send two people. They should be divided into seven groups, each with three people, and go to each township on the morning of the 11th at 8:00 AM to conduct household surveys together with the Pao-Chia chiefs. After the survey is completed, the flour certificate will be issued immediately so that the poor people can receive the flour early with the certificate. It is estimated that there are nearly 6,000 poor people in a total of 84 pao in the seven townships. If 6,000 bags of flour and 3,000 bags of bean flour are allocated, each person can receive one bag of flour and half a bag of bean flour. In the future, if there is any surplus in the allocated accounts and relief rice, it can still be given to the most severely affected households in Huaiyin.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Province's Finances in Dire Straits: Two Senior Officials Fly to the Capital for Instructions</h3>
<p>Budget Deficit of 32 Billion This Year</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu] The Sichuan Provincial Government's budget for this year has been prepared and approved by the Sichuan Provincial Assembly after three plenary sessions. The total provincial revenue and expenditure are each 59.53 billion yuan. The total revenue is 27.5 billion yuan, including 10.8 billion yuan from Sichuan's land tax, business tax, and thirteen other tax revenues, and 16.7 billion yuan in central government subsidies (for grain agencies and road maintenance) and assistance funds for various counties. The total expenditure is 59.53 billion yuan, with approximately 13 billion yuan allocated to education and culture, followed by administration, finance, security, and construction. The total deficit for the year is 32 billion yuan. The budget deficits of all counties in Sichuan are also over 100 million yuan. If the new public servant salary standards promulgated by the central government are followed for salary adjustments, the total deficit for all counties in Sichuan would be approximately 160 billion yuan. Sichuan's current financial situation is extremely tight. There is a shortage of 6 billion yuan for provincial expenses before the Lunar New Year. Deng Hanxiang, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Finance Department, and Yu Chengyuan, Chief Accountant of the Provincial Government, jointly flew to the capital on the 10th to seek instructions from the central government on how to adjust and resolve the situation.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Provincial Bank's Accounts Unclear: Assembly Members Report Problems, Decision to Establish an Investigation Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu] At the Third Plenary Session of the Sichuan Provincial Assembly, during the Sichuan Provincial Bank's work report, the absence of Kang Xinzhi, the bank's general manager, who was in Beijing on official business, caused a great uproar. Assembly members filed reports, claiming that the bank had profited by 100 billion yuan when recovering US dollar bonds, that over 7 billion yuan in off-book assets had unclear accounting, and that the handling of production loans was improper, with both former and current personnel suspected of dereliction of duty. A resolution was unanimously passed to establish an investigation committee to thoroughly investigate the bank's total assets and all accounts, and to suggest that the bank should implement independent accounting and establish personnel and operational standards. A telegram was also passed urging Kang to return to Sichuan as soon as possible to attend and report, otherwise he should resign.</p>

<h3>Ferry Service Restored in Minhang and Fengxian, Facilitating Traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Minhang] The Shanghai Engineering Office of the Highway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications considers the Minhang Huangpu River a vital transportation route on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Before the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Communications had a special ferry for automobiles to cross the river, which was very convenient. During the occupation, this transportation means was destroyed long ago. A Minhang Ferry Management Office was specially established and ordered an amphibious landing craft from the United States, specially for military, government, commercial, passenger cars, and animal-powered carts to cross the river. The ferry has now arrived in Minhang and has begun operation. The fare for first-class cars is 1,500 yuan in national currency; for animal-powered carts, it is 750 yuan in national currency. This has been implemented since the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fengxian] Xidu Estuary in this county is a key point on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Before the war, a state-run ferry used to run to Hangzhou to maintain traffic on the Huangpu River. Since the enemy invaded, the ferry service was suspended. Usually, wooden barges were relied on for crossing, which was quite inconvenient. Now that the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway has been restored and opened to traffic, the Huangpu River ferry service urgently needs to be restored. It is reported that the Ferry Management Office has approved the Shanghai-Fengxian Ferry Company to operate the service before the establishment of a state-run ferry, in order to facilitate the safe and prompt passage of passengers. The company is actively preparing and will resume service soon.</p>

<h3>Proclamation to the Families of Martyrs Zhu and Tang</h3>
<p>I am an active-duty soldier currently serving as an education adjutant in the First Battalion of the Seventh Officers Training Corps in Wuchang. During the War of Resistance, I served in the 79th Army of the Army. Because two of my fellow soldiers from the same hometown in this army sacrificed themselves for the country and were buried in foreign lands, now that victory has been achieved, their families may not know the truth and may still be waiting hopefully for news of their beloved sons or fathers. Now I am announcing the facts so that their families can understand the truth, no longer harbor empty hopes, and can apply to the government for pensions and transport their loyal remains back home.</p>
<p>The first is Zhu Shiwei from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, who was around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old at the time. Before the war, his family lived in the Yong'an Street of the French Concession in Shanghai. After the War of Resistance began, he entered the 15th class of the Infantry Department of the Central Military Academy. After graduating, he was assigned to work in the 79th Army. During the Battle of Changde in the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic, he was a company commander in the 194th Division of the 79th Army. He was seriously wounded and died on the way to treatment. He is now buried in the countryside of Dayong, Hunan.</p>
<p>The second is Tang Yiming from Yixing, Jiangsu, who was fifty-three or fifty-four years old at the time. His wife had passed away, and he had only one daughter in Shanghai. During the occupation, he taught at Sizaobang Elementary School in Pudong. Before the war, Tang had worked as a teacher and clerk in the district government in Xiaofeng and Anji, Zhejiang. When the area was occupied, he joined the 79th Army and served as a clerk, etc. In the summer of the 34th year of the Republic, he was working as a clerk in the 10th Regiment of the Fourth Training Corps of the Chinese Army Headquarters when he died of illness in Sanyanggang, Taoyuan County. He is now buried there.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned Zhu and Tang were both my friends during their lifetimes, and I worked with them in the 79th Army for many years. Zhu was also a classmate from an earlier class at the military academy. Because the two gentlemen were unable to communicate with their hometowns during the war and passed away suddenly, and because so much time has passed and they are far away in foreign lands, it is very difficult for their families to find out. Therefore, I dare to expose this in the newspaper, hoping that the relatives and friends of the two gentlemen in Shanghai, knowing this news, will quickly arrange for the transportation of the coffins and apply for pensions, etc., so that my wish will be fulfilled. If Zhu and Tang knew about this under the spring, they would be able to rest in peace. Cheng Hander's mailing address: Wuchang Jinshuizha Headquarters</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel sadness when I read the article about the abandoned baby in Chongming published in your newspaper on January 9th. Yimin even witnessed a baby being wrapped in rice straw and placed on an open-air fresh produce stall as if it were fish, on the morning of the day before yesterday. This situation is truly heartbreaking. If Chongming is like this, other impoverished and disaster-stricken areas must be even worse, which is truly painful. Before the war, infant care institutions were established everywhere, varying in scale depending on local economic conditions, but they were all supported and managed by local philanthropists and gentry. During the war, due to the oppressive environment, most were destroyed. I sincerely hope that local authorities and philanthropists and gentlemen will actively plan to restore the original infant care institutions in those places, and for those places where economic capacity is limited, the government should find ways to provide subsidies to promote their establishment. At the same time, the baojia system should be used to strictly prohibit abandonment and protect humanity. There is nothing more urgent than this. I hope philanthropists everywhere will quickly take action! (Qian Yimin)</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, this newspaper published an article by reader Zhang Yucheng, "Request to Restore Telegram Branch Offices." We have now received a letter from the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau in response, stating: "In order to avoid congestion for telegrams sent and received by all sectors, this Bureau has successively established eight branch offices at No. 25 Changzhi Road, Sichuan Road Post Office, Fujian Road, Ennan Road, Yuyuan Road, North Railway Station, and Wusong Pudong. Furthermore, because the location of the Bureau's main business office is not spacious, we have recently expanded the telegram receiving area to reduce congestion and achieve the goal of allowing telegram senders to send telegrams as soon as they arrive. However, due to the drastic fluctuations in prices recently, the congestion situation is uncertain from morning to night. This Bureau has been doing its best to add manpower and work overtime at any time. The sections pointed out by Mr. Zhang, such as the branch office refusing to accept telegrams and having to wait until the next morning to send them out, may not be consistent with the facts. We sincerely hope that Mr. Zhang will specify the date and time or come to the Bureau's business office to explain the process in detail. We will of course answer sincerely."</p>

<h3>Exchanging Views on Treaties with Germany and Austria: Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting Opens, Also to Determine Agenda for Moscow Conference, Defining Xinjiang Border Issue Inevitably to Cause Major Disputes</h3>
<p>[News Report] London, 14th Broadcast: The four-power deputy foreign ministers began discussing the treaty with Germany in London this morning. This four-power deputy foreign ministers' meeting is a prelude to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March this year and is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The four-power deputy foreign ministers' meeting opened today. French representative Hervé, American representative Reber, British representative Sir Strang, and Soviet representative Gusev will be responsible for drafting the treaty with Germany and drafting the agenda for the Moscow four-power foreign ministers' meeting. The treaty with Austria will be drafted by British representative Lord Hood, American representative General Clark, and Soviet representative Gusev.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 14th] The representatives of the four foreign ministers met today to discuss the drafting of the German and Austrian treaties. This meeting must be concluded by the 25th of this month so that the various agreements reached can be submitted to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March for review. Although it is not known what the Soviet Union's requirements are, the attitude of the United States has recently become more conciliatory. It is generally believed that the German and Austrian treaties should be treated differently. Austria should be granted full restoration of independence immediately, but the treaty with Germany must be harsh, making it pay the price for causing World War II, compensate the losses of various countries, and prevent the resurgence of dictatorship. However, in addition to the issue of punishing Germany itself, if its new border is determined, the interests of the victorious countries will vary, and disputes are bound to become a major obstacle.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] The meeting of the four-power representatives to discuss the German and Austrian issues is scheduled to begin here at 3:00 PM today (11:00 PM Shanghai time). The first thing to be decided today is whether the meeting will be open to the public. All previous deputy foreign ministers' meetings were confidential, but at the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference, ample news was released to the press. Therefore, the attitude to be adopted this time should be decided at the beginning of the meeting. Today's meeting may not immediately formulate a work plan for the two separate meetings on Germany and Austria. This plan should be decided in separate meetings. The Austrian issue meeting is also not as simple as generally imagined. The first thing to be decided is the extent to which Yugoslavia and Austria are allowed to participate in the discussions, and to review Yugoslavia's demands on Austria (Yugoslavia had previously submitted a note to the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference, wanting to demarcate the Carinthia Province, inhabited by Slovenian people in Austria, to Yugoslavia). Secondly, it is to decide what kind of German funds within the military districts of Austria can be transferred as reparations. In addition, there is also the issue of navigation on the Austrian part of the Danube River. This issue may once again cause a conflict of interest between Western countries and the countries along the Danube River, because the countries along the Danube River hope that the river will be controlled only by each of them, while the Western countries hope that the river will become a truly internationally controlled river for all countries to navigate. This position has not changed to this day. The main task of the German issue meeting, in addition to reviewing the opinions of the smaller countries, is to decide whether to allow the future German government to sign the German treaty. Luxembourg's land claims against Germany are expected to conflict with France. Luxembourg requires its eastern border along the Our and Sauer rivers to extend up to five and a half kilometers further and also requires a small square of land south along the Moselle River. Part of this land is within the so-called Greater Saar region claimed by France, so France is expected to oppose this claim.</p>
<h3>Germany and Austria Hope to Attend and Present Arguments</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 13th] The four-power deputy foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the German issue is scheduled to begin tomorrow in London. German political and official circles hope that at least two or three of the four powers will agree to allow German experts to attend and present their opinions. Although they have not yet formally submitted a request to the Allied Control Council, they claim that two of the four powers have already paid attention to this issue. Before returning to Moscow, Marshal Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces, had informally discussed this matter with the German side and the Allied side. It is heard that Murphy, the American political representative, agrees to allow German experts to attend and present their opinions. Although Britain has not formally expressed its position, it is expected to take the same attitude as the United States and the Soviet Union. The only question is the attitude of France. It is heard that each major German political party will soon submit a list of experts to the Allied Control Council for approval. After approval, the Allied Control Council can instruct them on the scope of their activities.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The Austrian government has formally requested the four powers to allow it to participate in the negotiations on Austria's future as soon as possible. The Austrian government's note points out that Austria was the first country to be invaded by Hitler. The current discussion on Austria's future should aim to restore Austria as destroyed by Hitler. Obviously, it is impossible to revive it without Austria's participation.</p>
<h3>Czech Republic Requests Revision of Border Treaty</h3>
<p>Denmark States Its Position on the Treaty with Germany</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 13th] After the Czech government issued a memorandum to the four powers explaining its views on the future fate of Germany, it is widely believed that it requires the current border line between the Czech Republic and Germany to be moved into German territory so that the Czech Republic can control the Bohemian hillside originally in German territory. It has been said that the memorandum also raises other demands on German territory, such as Ratibor and Hlubiszów, controlled by Poland after the Potsdam Agreement. This statement has been corrected by people here, saying that it is not true. Since the Czech government did not mention Hlubiszów in the memorandum, everyone believes that the Czech Republic supports the current border between Germany and Poland near Mies and Wodzisław.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Danzig, 13th] People here said that when the four countries hold a deputy foreign ministers' meeting in London to discuss the German issue, Denmark's position will be the same as in the recent memorandum to the four powers, that is, Denmark believes that the meaning of democratic rights stipulated in the Weimar Constitution is not sufficient and that the people's rights and individual freedoms of the German people still need to be protected before they can be qualified. The minority non-Germanic people in Germany, especially the pro-Danish people in the Southern Schleswig region, should also be given the same protection. Denmark also advocates that the Holstein administrative power in the Schleswig region should be self-governing in nature and that the local people should have the right to self-determination. In addition, Denmark should also demand that hundreds of thousands of foreign refugees in the region be sent elsewhere.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of Atomic Control, Britain Will Support the US Position</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Responsible parties declared today that if the United States and the Soviet Union face off in the Security Council, Britain will support the United States and firmly advocate that the issue of atomic energy control should be discussed before the issue of general disarmament. The Soviet Union advocates that the issue of general disarmament should be discussed immediately and opposes prioritizing the discussion of atomic energy. The United States believes that if a control method for atomic weapons is not decided first, the control of other weapons cannot be discussed. Representatives believe that the fundamental dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union is expected to be resolved at the Security Council meeting on the 15th. At the same time, representatives of the Security Council reviewed Britain's lengthy complaint against Albania, accusing Albania of planting mines in the Corfu Strait, killing and injuring 44 British soldiers. The case is expected to be submitted for discussion before the 17th.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Blum in London: Anglo-French Negotiations Underway, Events of Common Interest to the Two Countries Are the Theme of the Discussions, Talk of an Anglo-French Customs Union Rises Again</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The negotiations between French Prime Minister Blum and British Prime Minister Attlee were held at 10:00 AM today at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Ambassador to Britain Annet also participated. Bevin hosted a luncheon at noon, and the meeting continued at the Foreign Secretary's official residence in the afternoon. The meeting will continue tomorrow. The British government will formally host Blum tomorrow afternoon. Prime Minister Blum can only stay in London for sixty hours. The British side is well aware that he will withdraw from politics as soon as the French President is elected. If this opportunity is missed, it may not be available again for a while.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] On the day of French Prime Minister Blum's visit to Britain, many French economic experts were in London, including Baraduc, assistant to Alphen, Director of Economic Affairs of the French Foreign Ministry. According to well-informed sources, Baraduc's mission to Britain is to discuss the issue of reducing tariff barriers with the British government and to make the same request to the sixteen countries that participated in the trade preparatory meeting here last November. According to the information, the meeting at that time suggested that each participating country could propose various concessions before December 31st of last year. Today, Baraduc is discussing this matter with the British Ministry of Commerce representatives and exchanging views with British economic commissioners on the procedures for the Geneva Tariff Conference in April. It is recalled that when French Transportation Minister Moch recently visited the UK, there were rumors that the UK and France would sign a customs agreement. Now that Blum has arrived in the UK, this rumor has become even louder, but officials have not confirmed it. However, it is a fact that the two countries are currently conducting economic negotiations. In addition, British and French economic experts will hold a meeting in Paris on the 17th to allow the British side to learn the details of the French plan, and then carry out plans to develop British production. The parliament will study this matter next month.</p>
<p>Political and Economic Issues are Interrelated</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The Prime Minister's residence at No. 10 Downing Street officially issued a communiqué tonight, stating that the topic of discussion between French Prime Minister Blum and British Prime Minister Attlee this week was issues related to the common interests of the two countries. The official statement from the French Embassy in London also said that the discussion was about issues related to the common interests of the two countries. According to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, although French Prime Minister Blum's main motivation for coming to Britain was the issue of coal, well-informed sources pointed out that in fact, economic issues are difficult to separate from political issues, so the future of the entire Ruhr region will be reviewed at the same time. According to this agency's report from Paris, a French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that Prime Minister Blum's visit to Britain will discuss the coordination of the British and French rehabilitation plans and France's coal shortages with the British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Two Countries Exchange Letters</p>
<p>Blum responded and decided to go to the UK on the weekend. When French Transportation Minister Moch went to London on January 1st, he carried a letter from Blum to Attlee, expressing his hope to strengthen Anglo-American economic cooperation and strongly emphasizing that France's coal issue is inseparable from economic cooperation. However, at the current stage, France cannot be supplied with more coal. He sincerely hopes that Blum can go to London and talk directly with British cabinet members. The French spokesperson then said that Prime Minister Blum will return in time to participate in the French presidential election on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the First UN General Assembly Session - Guo Taiqi Praises the Achievements of the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] On the first anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly, Dr. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the Security Council, issued a statement praising the achievements of the United Nations. He stated that the economic, social, racial, and territorial issues to be resolved by the Economic and Social Council and the Trusteeship Council are of great importance. Although China was in a state of hardship and unrest last year, it was still able to adhere to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In this environment, China can be said to have made its greatest contribution to the United Nations. China firmly believes that to reach a political agreement on the above issues, far-reaching steps must be taken, and international cooperation is especially necessary. We believe that the treatment of people in all territories of the world who have not yet achieved self-government must be improved, and their economic and social rights should be recognized. If this is done, it will greatly benefit international understanding and world peace. The achievements of the United Nations General Assembly are significant, which is very gratifying. Among the most important achievements is the unanimous adoption by the United Nations General Assembly of a resolution on universal control and reduction of armaments and troops. If concrete and effective measures can be taken, the world will enter an era without war, and the human and economic resources of all countries will be used to promote human happiness and no longer for war.</p>
<h3>New French President - Auriol Expected</h3>
<p>Herriot as Candidate for Speaker</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 14th (Radio): French Radical Socialist leader Herriot has secured the qualifications of a candidate for the National Assembly after the Popular Republican Movement provided unanimous guarantees.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] French Communist Party Secretary-General Duclos declared in the parliamentarians' lounge today that the party would not nominate any candidate for Speaker of the National Assembly, but intends to nominate a candidate for Speaker of the Senate. The various political parties in the parliament are scheduled to convene a joint meeting tonight to exchange views on the presidential election scheduled for the 16th of this month. Observers predict that the various parties can form the following arrangement: (1) Socialist leader, the current Speaker of the National Assembly, Auriol, amiable, capable, and talented, will serve as President of the French Republic. (2) Communist Maran will serve as Speaker of the Senate. (3) As for the Speaker of the National Assembly, it will be Radical Socialist leader Herriot, allowing him to display his eloquence. (4) As for the position of Prime Minister, Blum, due to physical weakness, may not want to continue (his temporary position as acting Prime Minister will last until the formal election of the president), then it will be filled by a leader from the Popular Republican Movement, if not former Prime Minister Bidault, then it will be former Minister of Justice Teitgen.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Counter-Offensive in Hanoi - Safety of Overseas Chinese District Is Worrisome</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hanoi, 14th] Fierce fighting resumed in Hanoi today, with Viet Minh forces attacking French military positions surrounding the Overseas Chinese district of the city, and using 75mm field guns to bombard various areas of the city. The French military headquarters stated that the attackers on foot were members of the Viet Minh armed youth group, with the apparent intention of testing the strength of the French military positions. The intensity of the Viet Minh's offensive today was unprecedented in recent days, with simultaneous attacks on several locations, sometimes gathering hundreds of people to attack one place. The Overseas Chinese district, with a population of 10,000 overseas Chinese, has been surrounded by the Viet Minh forces, which has become a difficult problem for the French. The Overseas Chinese district occupies 500 square yards and stretches for a mile along the south bank of the Lo River. The Doumer Bridge, which crosses the Lo River and connects to Hanoi's airport, is located in this district.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 13th] An official communique was recently released, stating that French forces conducted a mopping-up operation in the southwest suburbs of Hanoi, and the Viet Minh troops retreated in haste, abandoning many corpses. In the Lang Son area, the Viet Minh regular army was forced to withdraw from the Bac Ninh district.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] According to a French observer who just returned from Vietnam, the recent killings of overseas Chinese in the south of the city were instigated by the Japanese, who falsely accused the overseas Chinese of being French spies as a pretext. The observer also said that the stage of large-scale military operations in Vietnam has passed, and there will only be mopping-up operations against the remaining forces in the future.</p>
<h3>Grafting Brings Back the Light</h3>
<p>[United Press, Reno, Nevada, 14th] Here, a 31-year-old Catholic priest, Edmund, who lost his sight in his right eye ten years ago due to a gunshot wound, has regained his sight after a local surgeon inserted the eyeball of an executed murderer into his right eye.</p>
<h3>Blum Government Will Clarify France's Attitude Towards Vietnam</h3>

<h3>Truman and Marshall Can Talk Across the Ocean</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman spoke with General Marshall in Hawaii by long-distance telephone today. White House Press Secretary Ross said that the two had a heartfelt conversation, and the time of General Marshall's arrival has not yet been determined and will be announced after the President speaks with him again.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Secret Files for Marshall to Refer to at Any Time</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] An official revealed today that when General Marshall takes office as Secretary of State this week, he will receive a secret file detailing the current diplomatic policies of the United States towards major countries, guiding him in handling diplomatic affairs. Marshall is the first Secretary of State in American history to receive this type of file. The nature of this file is very confidential, clearly explaining the basic policies accumulated by the United States. It was compiled by the State Department in conjunction with the Joint Chiefs of Staff based on reports from major ambassadors and opinions from informal advisors and famous university professors over several months, becoming a kind of national policy. This is of particular value to Marshall's urgent preparation to participate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference in early March. Although Marshall is familiar with the situation in China and is a world-renowned military strategist, he is still an outsider to the detailed inside story of post-war diplomatic developments in the United Nations, Europe, and other locations. The preliminary preparation for this comprehensive formulation of national policy began during Secretary of State Hull's time and was completed by Secretary of State Byrnes. After Byrnes' sudden resignation, he told a friend with admiration that he hoped he could have had this kind of file when he first took office as Secretary of State, as a compass for diplomatic negotiations.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Approves a Large Number of Diplomats</h3>

<h3>London Labor Strike Worsens - Labor Circles Oppose Military Transportation of Essential Foods</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] London dockworkers have decided to strike until the military withdraws from the market, in sympathy with the strike of food porters and truckers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The London transport workers' strike will be delayed until the 21st for a decision by the Central Wage Handling Bureau due to legal reasons, but employers and workers are still seeking other ways to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] Senior British government officials told reporters here today that Prime Minister Attlee threatened to resign on the 10th of this month during a dispute with three ministers who opposed the use of the military to transport essential food supplies. At the same time, another 10,000 workers joined the strike of 14,000 truck drivers today in a sympathy strike against the military transportation of essential food. The tense situation has become increasingly serious. Although the differences of opinion within the cabinet have been reduced, they have not yet been resolved, and the labor community has expressed unanimous dissatisfaction with Attlee's issuance of this order and will publicly express it again. Subway, bus, tram, and other drivers have openly discussed their dissatisfaction, but there has been no formal action to join the strike so far. One thousand trucks driven by the military are all stationed with police, and food markets are also protected by the police, but no disturbances have occurred. It is reported that truck drivers are demanding a 44-hour work week and two weeks of paid vacation per year.</p>
<h3>British Rocket Experts Arrive in Australia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Melbourne, 14th] British rocket expert Lieutenant General Ivans and eleven technical experts arrived here today from England and will preside over rocket testing in central Australia. It is said that British rockets will be used for this test instead of German rockets. The construction cost of the test site is £3 million, and the maintenance cost is approximately £3 million. A large number of personnel will be employed.</p>
<h3>Improving Equipment to Ensure Aviation Public Safety - British Consortium Formed - Many Airplane Accidents in Various Countries in Six Weeks</h3>
<p>Overseas Airlines, British European Airways, and British South American Airways have received permission from the Ministry of Civil Aviation and have now formed a consortium to ensure the safety of aviation travel. The company is named "International Aviation Wireless Electricity Co., Ltd.", equipped with wireless radio transmission, flight guidance, and blind landing equipment. The company does not aim to make profits, and is subsidized by the governments of relevant countries and the airlines using the equipment. It is expected to be established within six months and can start providing services.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] There have been many airplane accidents around the world in the past six weeks, resulting in the deaths of 200 people. Therefore, the authorities concerned announced today that they will take two major actions. The U.S. Senate committee summoned representatives from the U.S. Civil Aviation Administration and various airlines today to investigate the causes of the recent series of plane crashes. At the same time, the Philippine Far Eastern Airlines announced the suspension of flights on the Chinese route due to the accident of the "Luzon Little Miss" plane.</p>
<h3>Clarifying Positions - Both British and Burmese Sides</h3>
<p>Attlee's opening remarks to the Burmese on self-determination reiterated his previous statement, allowing "the people of Burma to decide for themselves, whether within or outside the British Commonwealth." Aung San, the chief representative of Burma, and representative Ba Shin responded directly, demanding complete independence for Burma. Aung San said: "The Burmese people unanimously demand complete autonomy. We certainly hope to exercise this right as soon as possible, and at the same time hope to exercise law and fact in the future." Ba Shin said: "Nothing but complete independence can satisfy the wishes of the Burmese people." The meeting will continue under the chairmanship of Wendeli. During the meeting, both sides avoided discussing the details of actual independence.</p>
<h3>Paraguay Declares National Martial Law</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paraguay, 13th] It was announced here that the government has discovered a pro-communist anarchist faction attempting to cause disruption, so it has declared national martial law for a period of thirty days, and President Morinigo has formally taken command of the national army.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Marches and Inspects - Calls for Indian-Muslim Unity</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 14th (Radio): Mahatma Gandhi of India continues to tour the areas of conflict between Hindus and Muslims in East Bengal Province, preaching his doctrine of non-violence. There are no railways there, and the roads are extremely bad. He is accompanied by a small number of followers and four black goats. When his followers arrive at a village, they always sing hymns together. Opinions on the success of Gandhi's trip vary. Newspapers supporting Gandhi say that his trip has given many Indians comfort and restored peace and goodwill to the conflict zones, but Muslim newspapers say that Gandhi's trip was a failure.</p>
<p>[United Press, Karachi, 13th] Gandhi set off from Lenchur at 7:30 this morning and arrived at Karachi on foot in half an hour. Because the soles of his shoes were broken and his toes were bleeding, Gandhi plans to walk through the villages of East Bengal in six days to call on all walks of life to unite Hindus and Muslims.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and Afghanistan Exchange Agreement Documents</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 13th] The Soviet Union and Afghanistan exchanged ratification documents yesterday in Kabul regarding the agreement on border issues between the two countries. The agreement was signed in Moscow in June last year.</p>
<h3>Will There Be a Food Panic Around the World This Year?</h3>
<p>In terms of the world's food production as a whole, large quantities of wheat, sugar, potatoes and fish are actively increasing in supply. This year, the production of rice and vegetable oils will increase, but meat, milk and cheese and other animal fats will still be as scarce as last year.</p>
<p>According to reports from wheat-producing areas on various continents, when various grains are harvested this year, their quantity will exceed any year during the war. The total harvest this year is about 5.9 billion bushels. From this figure, the future of bread-eating countries is optimistic.</p>
<p>Rice Production Still Insufficient</p>
<p>Most of the rice-eating countries are located in Asia. A large amount of rice production can also be expected this year, but it is still inferior to that before the war, decreasing by about 10%. Because Asia's population is multiplying rapidly, this year's grain production may not be enough to avoid serious famine. The total world rice production is estimated at 6.9 billion bushels, which is an improvement compared to last year's production of 6.3 billion bushels, but it is still far behind the pre-war production of 7.4 billion bushels. As a result, the Chinese and Indians will face localized famines.</p>
<p>The key to the current food problem is Europe and Asia. In Europe, wheat is the main food. The harvest of grains this year will be 1.2 billion bushels, which is a slight improvement compared to the 1.03 billion bushels last year, but it is still far behind the pre-war production of 1.62 billion bushels.</p>
<p>The heavy rain in the United Kingdom and Western Europe and the drought in Eastern Europe are the reasons for the decrease in wheat production in Europe. British wheat is often soaked and cracked by excessive rain during the autumn harvest. Naturally, these moldy grains are only suitable for animal feed and cannot be used to bake bread for human consumption.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe and the European part of the Soviet Union are both places where rain is lacking and it is difficult to harvest large quantities of rice and wheat. This year in Central and Eastern Europe, the production of wheat, potatoes, and sugar beets will not exceed 70% of pre-war production. The lack of fertilizer and political upheaval are the main reasons.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean Basin has plenty of sunshine and the production of food will have a good future. Greece, Italy, Spain and French North Africa can all have richer production than last year. The yield of grains, rice, potatoes, beets and olive oil may advance from 55% to 85% of pre-war levels. The most critical areas in Europe are western Germany and Austria. Poor weather, political turmoil, and lack of manpower all foreshadow a dark food future this year, similar to last year.</p>
<p>The increase in rice production in Asia cannot keep pace with the increase in the birth rate. In the past five years, India alone has added 25 million hungry people waiting to be fed.</p>
<p>Thailand, Burma, and French Indochina used to be surplus rice-producing areas, but their production is still far from what it was before the war. The reduction in production in this area is mostly affected by the Japanese occupation, as well as the lack of tools and political unrest.</p>
<p>China and India Face Even Greater Difficulties</p>
<p>China and India will continue to feel the threat of hunger. The crux of China's food problem lies in political instability, and the north-south railway trunk lines cannot be smoothly connected. Therefore, the people in the south and central regions cannot obtain food from the north. According to pre-war consumption, China still lacks 5.4 million tons of rice. The only way to save China from famine is to import rice and miscellaneous grains.</p>
<p>In India, the three months before last December's harvest were already experiencing an urgent shortage. To overcome this difficulty, India must import grain and reduce rationing. The United States, Brazil and other countries will supply rice to India, but the quantity is limited. Famine is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Abundant food will be produced in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Canada is expected to harvest 400 million bushels of wheat this year, which has not been seen since 1942, an increase of 35% compared to last year. Large quantities of grain are now being transported directly from farmers' wheat fields to the United Kingdom via Hudson Bay, which takes just over a week. Oats and barley will also have abundant yields.</p>
<p>The United States will produce 1.16 billion bushels of wheat this year, an increase of 37 million bushels compared to last year. The Department of Agriculture estimates that if the climate is normal this year, it is possible to reach this fixed number. Last year, in order to relieve the famine in Europe and Asia, the United States opened up its warehouses, and the remaining grain was the lowest in 20 years. This year, it is expected to increase to 275 million bushels, and it is possible that a large amount of wheat will remain in storage for emergencies.</p>
<p>Animal fats in the United States will decrease slightly compared to last year. It is necessary to increase imports and prohibit export dumping. Storage capacity is also very limited. Although pig breeding may increase in a certain area of the United States, it is still difficult to catch up with last year.</p>
<p>Last year's strike by the US shipping industry occurred when the famine in the Far East was severe and the US urgently needed to import food, which exacerbated the hunger and malnutrition of the people in the eastern countries.</p>
<p>Argentina's grain and wheat exports are far below pre-war standards. Only meat exports exceeded the 1945 quantity. Argentina's rural areas have planted 10% more this year than last year, and it is predicted that exports will have significant progress this year.</p>
<p>Food rationing will still be implemented in many countries to reduce the aggravation of food panic. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will continue to ration bread.</p>
<p>Food Controls Will Still Be Maintained</p>
<p>International food controls will still continue. It is necessary to find ways to transport large quantities of food to the countries that need it most. The production and consumption of food in the current world cannot be left to natural evolution. But controlling surplus food to eliminate food shortages this year is not as urgent as last year.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing food panic, such as China and India, also need economic assistance. The United States must take on this responsibility. Areas that were trampled on by the Japanese army are continuing to need food imports.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and several Western European countries will also need food imports due to poor harvests. The British will reduce the purchase of daily goods and raw materials to compensate for the lack of food. The UK's national budget will need to be increased in preparation for food imports.</p>
<p>There are still some obstacles in world shipping. Although the harvest is expected to be better this year, the famine-stricken areas are very far from the abundant harvest areas. This year, more ships will be needed to transport food to all parts of the world.</p>
<p>Wheat flour will flood the markets of countries around the world that do not use wheat flour as their main food. Indians originally only knew how to eat rice, but now they have accepted wheat flour as a substitute food. In Mexico and Brazil, rice-eating workers have now tried eating wheat flour, and they all like to eat pasta.</p>
<p>Opening up New Land Solves Food Shortages</p>
<p>This year, food storage will increase compared to last year, and there will be no more risky measures to empty warehouses to save famine like last year.</p>
<p>New soil must continue to be opened up and cultivated. The world's population is now about 5-10% higher than before the war. But food production has not yet reached pre-war quantities.</p>
<p>But it can be asserted that there will not be a large-scale famine this year. Although the people of the entire world cannot reach the pre-war "normal" food standard, there may be hope for food abundance by 1948. (Translated by Yu Jing from "World Report Weekly")</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] The Department of Agriculture recently announced that the UN will ship 8,500 tons of grain to China in February to aid refugees. The total US grain exports in February totaled 460 million bags, which is almost the highest figure in 1946-1947. The distribution is as follows: United Kingdom 19,000 tons, British territories in the Pacific 42,500 tons, India 69,500 tons, British and American occupied areas of Germany 301,000 tons, French occupied areas of Germany 35,500 tons, Japan 16,500 tons, Korea 16,500 tons, Belgium and the Netherlands 38,500 tons each, Switzerland 27,000 tons, Austria 35,500 tons, Greece 30,000 tons, Italy 22,000 tons, Poland 2,500 tons (Note: This grain refers to wheat and other items, excluding rice. The UN plans to ship 245,000 tons of rice to China in the first half of 1947).</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Relations Division declared that the pre-war rice production standard was 7.4 billion bushels. If it is desired to restore the original state, it depends on whether Asia can restore its production. The 1945 production was 11% short of supply and consumption. It is feared that in the coming year, the Western Hemisphere will need to transport rice to the Eastern Hemisphere, reversing the past situation. It will take two to three years before countries hope that rice-producing countries in Asia will restore their pre-war status and export rice.</p>

<h3>Reading and Studying Issues A Debate Lower Semester Private School Tuition Decided to Appropriately Increase Free Quota Strictly Enforced According to Regulations</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The day before yesterday, the Senate discussed the tuition standard for private primary and secondary schools for the next semester (second semester of the 35th year), but no result was reached. Yesterday, during the plenary session, the senators spoke enthusiastically and emotionally, which still caused a fierce debate. As a result, it was decided that the maximum amount for primary school tuition would be 130,000 yuan, junior high school would be 170,000 yuan, and senior high school would be 220,000 yuan. (According to the tuition standard for the previous semester, primary school was 80,000 to 120,000 yuan, junior high school was 120,000 to 160,000 yuan, and senior high school was 160,000 to 200,000 yuan, an increase of about 10%. The standard proposed by the Bureau of Education for discussion in the plenary session was 100,000 to 150,000 yuan for primary school, 150,000 to 200,000 yuan for junior high school, and 200,000 to 250,000 yuan for senior high school, an increase of 25% compared to the previous semester.)</p>
<p>During the discussion, the Director of the Bureau of Education took the stage and explained the tuition standard proposed by the Bureau of Education with numbers, saying: Before the war, primary school tuition was about 8 to 12 yuan. Taking 12 yuan as the base and multiplying it by the living index of 6,000, the current tuition should be 72,000 yuan. However, the salary of primary school teachers before the war was 20 to 40 yuan. Taking the average of 30 yuan and multiplying it by 6,000, it is only 180,000 yuan per month. Before the war, secondary school tuition was 25 to 30 yuan. Taking 30 yuan and multiplying it by 6,000, it should be 180,000 yuan. The salary of secondary school teachers before the war was 120 to 160 yuan. Taking 100 yuan and multiplying it by 6,000, it should be 600,000 yuan. Please compare these with the proposed standard.</p>
<p>Those who opposed the tuition increase for this semester included Jiang Huaisu, Huang Bingquan, Fei Shuzeng, and Zhou Lianze. Their reasons were: The life of teachers and staff should be sympathized with, but the burden on most parents should be taken into consideration. After the fee increase, the treatment of teachers and staff has not improved, but the principal has made a fortune. Now the tuition has increased by about ten thousand times compared to before the war, so the treatment of teachers and staff should also be increased by this multiple. Otherwise, it will only increase the interests of a few people. Schools are not like shops and should prioritize education. If the funding is insufficient, the board of directors can subsidize it. As Director Gu said, before the war, secondary school tuition was 30 yuan. Calculated at today's living index of 6,000 times, it should be 180,000 yuan. But in the previous semester, when it was 3,700 times, 200,000 yuan was charged, which is half more. If interest is added, not only can this semester not be paid, but some can be taken back. How many people have committed economic suicide recently reported in the newspapers? In the previous semester, some borrowed money for their children's tuition. With this year being so tight, how can they afford this tuition? We are here to represent the majority of the people, not just a few. Please look outside the door more!</p>
<p>Those who supported the standard proposed by the Bureau of Education included Xi Yushu, Deng Fuchun, Tao Guangchuan, and Fu Xiaozeng. Their reasons were that private schools rely entirely on student tuition to maintain themselves. In the past six months, rice, yarn, gold, and paper money have all risen in price. According to the cost of living index, it has risen by about 50% compared to the previous semester, but the proposed tuition standard only increases by 25%. Teachers' lives are threatened, but tuition is not allowed to be adjusted, which is unreasonable. Everyone has children and hopes to receive a good education, but the teaching efficiency can only be improved after the lives of teachers and staff are stable. Today, we should encourage people to run education, and we must not dishearten those who are already in the education field and make them leave. If it is said that the board of directors can subsidize the funding, most of the board of directors are nominal. Among the participating senators, there are also those who serve as directors. May I ask how much funding has been taken out? Which school has it been given to? As for saying that parents are a cow and cannot bear the burden, teachers are also a cow, and they not only have to be a cow for their own children, but also for educating other people's children! Senator Tao Guangchuan even shouted loudly: Having participated in education work for 20 years, I am disheartened to witness this situation today.</p>
<p>Subsequently, many people put forward compromise opinions. Zhu Wende advocated maintaining the original amount for primary schools in the previous semester, while increasing 20,000 yuan for secondary schools. Qu Yue advocated that the maximum for primary schools should be 100,000 yuan, and the maximum for secondary schools should be the standard proposed by the Bureau of Education. Wang Xianqing advocated that primary schools should be 100,000 to 140,000 yuan, junior high schools should be 140,000 to 180,000 yuan, and senior high schools should be 180,000 to 220,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Voting At the end, when Speaker Yuan was about to put it to a vote, Senator Lu Yinchu suddenly requested the Speaker to explain Article 13 of the Senate's organizational law (which stipulates that when voting on motions related to their own interests, they should withdraw from the venue, so senators related to the education sector would not be allowed to participate in the vote). Speaker Yuan immediately stated that he had no right to interpret it. If this article is implemented, then regardless of the discussion of agricultural, commercial, and industrial laws, agricultural associations, chambers of commerce, trade unions, or lawyers would not be allowed to participate in the vote. If there is a lack of communication, this article can only be explained by the central government. Subsequently, the two opinions of appropriately adding and not adding were put to a vote. As a result, the majority voted for appropriately adding, and the various amounts of appropriate addition were put to a vote. As a result, the majority passed the decision that the maximum amount for primary schools should not exceed 130,000 yuan, junior high schools should not exceed 170,000 yuan, and senior high schools should not exceed 220,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Free Quota Furthermore, the Ministry of Education stipulated that private schools approved by the Municipal Senate must have a 20% free quota and a 10% half-fee quota. The senators spoke one after another, saying that most private schools in the previous semester did not comply with this regulation. Speaker Yuan expressed his opinion on this, saying: The Municipal Senate approved the tuition standard for private schools and the free quota in the previous semester. Now private schools only know how to charge fees according to the standard, but do not comply with the free quota regulations, which is simply a deception. It is proposed that the Bureau of Education thoroughly investigate the issue of free and half-fee quotas for private schools in the previous semester. If anyone does not comply with the regulations, the board of directors should replace the principal, otherwise the board of directors should be disbanded. Director Gu then claimed that the average free quota for each school in the previous semester accounted for 15%, the main reason being that when the Senate passed this case last time, most schools had already charged fees. It is not easy to ask them to spit out the fees they have already collected. Therefore, the Speaker said that the responsibility for replacing the principal for failing to comply with the regulations is probably heavy, and the entire group will be replaced. This is because I did not supervise effectively in the previous semester, and I am very sorry. Speaker Yuan then changed this proposal to asking the Bureau of Education to thoroughly investigate the situation of free quotas for private schools last year and report it to this council. This year, please notify all schools in advance and strictly enforce it. Otherwise, the principal will be replaced and the board of directors will be disbanded. The entire room applauded and passed the motion.</p>

<h3>The "Miss Luzon" Tragedy A Moving and Tragic Scene… Red Star Dancer Sacrifices Herself to Save a Friend Li Suolan Wrongfully Sinks in the South China Sea Luo Zhifeng Dies of Serious Injuries in Luzon Zhou Lijuan Escapes Death and Telegrams Peace</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the missing passengers of the "Miss Luzon" accident, Miss Feng Ying, who bravely rescued her companion Luo Zhifeng but unfortunately "went to sea," has been identified as Li Suolan, from Ningbo, only 19 years old, a "red star" in the "Metropolitan" ballroom. Li came from the flower world. She used to have a room in Qunyufang Ronghua's house, but she stopped for a while and went to Beijing to visit relatives. This time, she returned to the entertainment venue and lived in Yihua's house at No. 4, Lane 4, Xinhui Le Li, which was only two months ago. Li was tired of living in a brothel for a long time, so she changed to the "Metropolitan" and became a formal dance partner. Unexpectedly, not long after she went to sea, she became famous for "going to sea." Moreover, her death was a sacrifice to save lives, which is also a rare character in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Li's departure from Shanghai on this flight was purely due to the call of a regular customer for a short meeting in Hong Kong. Li's best friend, Zhou Lijuan (alias Zhou Ping on the list), was originally a friend in the dance world. Zhou participated in the "Miss Shanghai" beauty pageant when she was a dance queen and was a red star at the MGM Ballroom. The two usually had extensive contacts and got to know Li Chengyu, the chairman of Dafu Company. It happened that Dafu planned to set up a branch in Hong Kong, so they agreed to go together. In addition to Li Chengyu, the other people traveling together were Luo Zhifeng, the person in charge of the company, and Li's friend Sun Ziqing (mistakenly listed as Sun Zhiqing on the list).</p>
<p>The "Miss Luzon" was originally scheduled to depart on the 10th, but it was heard that it was temporarily postponed due to bad weather. At that time, Li Suolan stayed at Zhou Lijuan's residence before the trip for the convenience of traveling. On the morning of the next day at 6:30, when the "Miss Luzon" decided to take off, Li and Luo drove to Zhou's residence to urge them to go together. The two women were still dreaming, and after hearing the news, they were very excited, so they hurriedly dressed up and rushed to the airport.</p>
<p>Looking back at the China Airlines plane crash on Christmas Day, Zhang Chunhua, a martial arts actor, was injured and treated at Zhongshan Hospital. Zhou Lijuan went to visit and comfort him. Witnessing the tragedy at that time, she was deeply wary, so she also considered this flight, and her family also advised her not to take the risk. However, Zhou Lijuan thought that Far Eastern Airlines was run by foreigners, and the plane was a DC4 four-engine aircraft, so she thought it was absolutely reliable, so she decided to take the trip regardless of everything. Unexpectedly, after flying away from Shanghai, something happened again, which was not expected at the time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the "Miss Luzon" flew out of Shanghai and approached Kaitak Airport in Hong Kong, it was also unable to land due to dense fog, so it continued to fly to Manila. Unexpectedly, when it approached the sea near Luzon, it was forced to crash into the sea due to an engine fire. At that time, Zhou and Li were the first to be rescued and were safe and sound, but because Luo Zhifeng, who was traveling with them, had unfortunately been injured when the plane made a forced landing and could not climb into the rubber dinghy, Li could not bear to see him die, so she bravely returned to the plane to rescue Luo. Unexpectedly, at that time, the bay was constantly invaded, and Li was swallowed by the waves and forever fell into the "sea of suffering." At this time, the plane had also sunk, and there were still five people on board, who sank with the plane, including Li Chengyu!</p>

<h3>Identities of Five Missing Confirmed</h3>
<p>Guo Kuangying, who is missing, is a delegate from Guangdong Province and a businessman in Hong Kong and Guangdong. He is a member of the Guo Linshuang family, the general manager of Wing On Company. After the news of the "Miss Luzon" accident reached here, Wing On first telegraphed this newspaper to inquire about the news of Delegate Guo. Unfortunately, he was reported missing. It is said that Guo was returning to Guangdong via Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Boying is the owner of Yikuang Candy Factory in this port. He enjoys a good reputation in the industrial and commercial circles and is a leader of national product manufacturers.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Li Chengyu, mentioned earlier, is the chairman of Dafu Trading Company and the son of Li Peiyan, the former Minister of Civil Affairs of Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>Chen Ningguan is the assistant manager of the Overseas Chinese Xingye Company and went to Hong Kong on business.</p>
<p>Chen Yizhi, another missing person, is the chief of the general affairs section of the Taiwan Provincial Trade Bureau's Hong Kong office. Chen and his colleague Mr. Guo returned to Hong Kong from Taiwan via Shanghai. They were originally scheduled to fly to Hong Kong on China Airlines on the 6th of this month. However, due to the Ministry of Communications' order to suspend the flights of China and Central Airlines for one week, they changed to a Far Eastern Airlines ticket for the 7th. Later, due to the "Miss Luzon" being repaired, it was postponed to the 10th, and then to the 11th. "Far Eastern" reduced the number of passengers to 30 because the plane had just been repaired. Chen and Guo were assigned to the next flight. Later, someone canceled their ticket, and Chen was able to board the plane because he had important business to attend to. Unfortunately, he died.</p>
<p>Zhou Decheng, whose name appeared in the list of rescued passengers, is a mistake for Dai Zhicheng. Dai is the business manager of Dihua Economic and Construction Company. Zhou Lun is a mistake for Guanglun, who is the shipping manager of the company. The two were traveling to Australia via Hong Kong to take over the company's ships and purchase wool for "Fangjian."</p>
<h3>Another Unfortunate News: US Aircraft Crashes and Destroyed in Shantou</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A C-46 type aircraft, number 584, belonging to a certain US unscheduled airline, piloted by Chester Pickcup, took off from Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 11th of this month. After flying near the Taiwan Strait, it suddenly went missing. On the 14th, it was found on a beach in Shantou, the entire aircraft destroyed.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, aircraft number 584 and another C-46 type aircraft, number 586, belonging to the same company, took off from Shanghai simultaneously under adverse weather conditions. Aircraft number 586 was also forced to land on a beach on the South China coast due to the bad weather, but later took off again and safely arrived at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Pickcup's aircraft was destroyed on a beach 30 miles south of Shantou. It is reported that pilot Pickcup has walked to Shantou city. It is also rumored that three other flight personnel were with him, but this has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>When these two aircraft took off from Longhua, they were dissuaded by some experienced pilots. However, the two American pilots test-flew over the airport for four hours, considering it satisfactory. When the two aircraft left Longhua, they did not go through inspection procedures. Initially, the airport staff thought they were just conducting test flights in the area.</p>
<p>These two aircraft were leased by the Central Aviation Transport Corporation at the beginning of last year, with a three-month contract. However, before the contract expired, they were grounded due to poor engine condition and excessive fuel consumption.</p>
<p>After the US airline company repaired the two aircraft at Longhua Airport, they flew to Hong Kong last Saturday.</p>
<p>It is rumored that after arriving in Hong Kong, the two aircraft were originally intended to be equipped with new engines and then fly to Manila, crossing the Pacific Ocean to Mexico. Another theory is that the two aircraft were sold to a certain American airline in Southeast Asia, but neither has been confirmed.</p>

<h3>Flowerbed Hiding Opium Case Unveiled: Pei Yuanjun Knew About the Planting and Fragrance but Failed to Report; Drug Trafficker Ye Qinghe Suspected as the Owner; Thousand Pounds of Opium to be Sent to the National Health Administration</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A large quantity of opium, weighing one thousand pounds and valued at 3.3 billion, was unearthed from the soil in a flowerbed at the residence of Pei Yuanjun, number 31 Dade Lane, Lin Sen Middle Road. Details have been reported in this newspaper. According to Pei Yuanjun's statement at the Changre Precinct yesterday, he was unaware of the opium. He purchased the house from Shi Zhaoguang in June 1942, with a purchase contract as proof. On the first day he moved into the new house, he noticed a mulberry tree planted in the flowerbed in the courtyard, which he considered inauspicious, so he asked the gardener Zhou Asan to replace it with a nandina plant. When excavating the soil, he discovered that the soil contained fragrant substances. After investigating, he realized it was opium. He originally intended to report it to the police, but he was afraid to cause trouble during the enemy occupation. He also stated that when he moved in, there was a safe buried under the stairs, the contents of which he did not know. Later, he ordered it to be cemented over, and now coal briquettes are piled there. According to the statement, Chief Zhao of the precinct immediately ordered officers to investigate. They found many loads of coal briquettes, which they removed, revealing white cement and a safe underneath. They then hired a coppersmith, Mao Peilong, to pry it open with a hammer, only to find the safe full of sewage and no other items. Pei also stated that Shi Zhaoguang is currently located at number 5, Lane 53, Zheng Lu. Police were dispatched to that address, and Shi was brought to the station. Shi stated that after the house was completed in 1930, he rented it to a Korean (surname forgotten) for about nine months. After that, he rented it to Ye Qinghe, who ran the Guomin Pharmacy on Shenhua Road. Unexpectedly, before a few months had passed, the "January 28th Incident" broke out, and Ye moved elsewhere. Later, he saw in the newspaper that the Shanghai Municipal Council had offered a reward for Ye's arrest, and he realized that Ye was involved in a major case of privately trafficking morphine. At that time, he moved his family in to live there, but soon moved back to his old house at number 1235 Siwen Lane, Datong Road. The house was then rented to Hu Songgao, a technician at the Academia Sinica. In April 1935, Hu moved out, and the house remained vacant for six months. After that, he moved back in and lived there for eight years. In June 1942, he sold it to Pei Yuanjun. He knew nothing else. Gardener Zhou Asan also came to the station for questioning, and his statement was largely the same as Pei Yuanjun's. Chief Zhao of the precinct further told reporters that the interrogation of the suspects in this case has been completed, and tomorrow they will be sent to court. The opium is planned to be sent to the Narcotic Drugs Administration of the National Health Administration for use in manufacturing medicines. Although Pei Yuanjun is indeed a legitimate businessman, his failure to report the matter is also difficult to excuse.</p>

At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, she suddenly received a strange phone call, asking her to talk at the Nanjing Cafe. When she asked his name, he said that she would recognize him when they met. After saying that, he hung up the phone. Miss Wan thought this was peculiar and wanted to find out what was going on, so she went as agreed. When she arrived at the cafe, she sat alone.

<h3>A Gift of a Son from Heaven Turns Out to Be False</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A reader with the pseudonym "Qiu Hai" sent a letter to this newspaper, stating that among the passengers on China National Aviation Corporation aircraft number 115, which crashed beside the Heta Temple last year, in addition to the four-year-old Wang Didi who was safe and sound, there was also a swaddled infant who was ejected and caught in the branches of a tree, also unharmed. The infant was taken back and raised by a nearby village woman. The child was fair and beautiful, and the village woman believed it was a gift of a son from Heaven. Mr. Qiu Hai described it in detail. Therefore, this reporter was ordered to go to Heta Temple yesterday to investigate.</p>
<p>Was there really such a thing? The reporter returned empty-handed from Heta [Damaged] Labor Protection Supplies Temple. On the way back, I thought of this Mr. "Qiu Hai." Perhaps he really is "childless in middle age," thinking about "a gift of a son from Heaven" all day long, to the point of confusing his mind. Furthermore, the news of recent plane crashes happened one after another. The old man was therefore dazed and associated it with the branches of the tree at Heta Temple. There are plenty of "fair and beautiful" infants in the world, but the miracle on the branches of the tree at Heta Temple is just a figment of his imagination.</p>
<p>The wreckage of aircraft number 115 is still there, with a dozen workers dismantling parts. The part of the Heta Temple that was crushed is still a pile of rubble. The reporter also met the principal, Mr. Sun, who survived the disaster, as well as the simple villagers nearby who showed surprised looks. They all laughed when they heard the reporter describe this unconfirmed story. Some said, "It's a joke!" Others said, "We all have children at home." Principal Sun, seemingly the hope of the village, said to me with certainty, "Absolutely not such thing. It's simply absurd. Good for a little reward. If it was hidden at home, would people not know?"</p>
<p>We left Heta Temple laughing and took a photo of this "reborn" Principal Sun on the pile of rubble as a harvest for this trip. The broken trunk of the tree next to the wreckage of the destroyed aircraft [damaged], the dead branches are swaying empty in the wind.</p>
<p>Detailed description came in a letter, but the trip to Heta Temple was in vain.</p>

<h3>High Jianchong and Li Hu, Two Traitors, Sentenced on the Same Day After Retrial by High Court; Reduced Sentences</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Jianchong, who once served as the captain of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army and an action member of the Shanghai District of the Military Statistics Bureau, later arrested by the enemy and defected, serving as the chief of a puppet police station and a secret agent for the enemy's Shanghai South Gendarmerie (reporting the whereabouts of Wu Jie, a member and secretary-general of our two special district party branches, to the enemy, leading to Wu's arrest by the enemy), was previously sentenced by the High Court to eight years of imprisonment. The defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court remanded the case for retrial.

<h3>As Squad Leader of the Security Team: Admits to Murder</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) Zhang Xuegen, who once served as a squad leader of the puppet security team, killed another squad leader, Xiang Yingtang, due to uneven distribution of taxes during the enemy occupation period. He was arrested by the puppet security headquarters and imprisoned in the puppet court. After the victory, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution for the crime of treason and murder. He was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant was gaunt and wearing a gray prison uniform, one trouser leg gray and one blue. He confessed to the murder, but as for the motive, he claimed that it was not due to the uneven distribution of taxes, but because he had persuaded Xiang Yingtang to join the Loyal National Salvation Army, which Xiang had not agreed to. He was afraid that it would be detrimental to him, so he took the opportunity to kill Xiang, seizing Xiang's Mauser pistol and fleeing. The court then asked why he did not join the Loyal National Salvation Army but instead joined the enemy's garrison force as a secret agent. The defendant prevaricated. Then, witness Shen Guanlian testified that the defendant had threatened him with a kitchen knife, demanding two rifles, and he settled the matter by paying 10,000 yuan in counterfeit currency. Finally, the defendant requested that Ma Desheng, the former captain of the Loyal National Salvation Army, be summoned to testify. The court ordered a change of date for retrial and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>

They were released only after the victory of the Resistance War. During their imprisonment, their family property suffered significant losses due to extortion by Hu, Jin, and others.

After the court hearing, it was determined that witnesses still needed to be summoned, and a new hearing date was set.</p>

<p>Zhao Ganxian, from Huaiyin, residing at number 210, Zhongzhou Hotel, Shandong Middle Road, carried 1.5 million yuan in cash, divided into two large packages, to Yulun Socks Factory at number 126, Jinling East Road, to purchase goods yesterday morning around 9:00 AM. He placed the money on the counter while choosing samples when he suddenly felt someone lingering beside him. When he turned around, he saw that the two packages of banknotes had disappeared. While he was hesitating, he noticed that the man next to him had also left. Zhao rushed out and saw the man hurriedly carrying the packages onto a pedicab. Zhao immediately grabbed him and called the police, who took him into custody at the jurisdictional police station. After interrogation, it was learned that the man's name was Chen Guocai, who had previously committed theft, been sentenced to imprisonment, and recently released under the general amnesty order. Unexpectedly, shortly after his release, he committed theft again. This is the first person to re-enter prison after the amnesty.</p>
<h3>American Sailor Stabs Pedicab Driver Case: Rogers Indicted; If Victim's Injuries Are Fatal, Indictment Clause May Be Changed</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) In the case of Rogers, an American sailor from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) fishing boat, stabbing pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang, the local prosecutor's office has been summoning relevant witnesses and collecting various materials in recent days. It has just been learned that the prosecutor has concluded the investigation of the case and filed a public prosecution yesterday. The indictment is based on Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law (intentionally inflicting an injury, which results in grievous bodily harm, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no less than three years and no more than ten years). Cheng Rongfang suffered injuries to his lungs and gallbladder, and the injuries were extremely serious. Even if the wounds could be healed, his health would be greatly affected in the future. Therefore, the prosecutor believed that he should be indicted for the crime of causing grievous bodily harm. If the victim dies due to the injuries during the trial, the indictment clause will be changed. The prosecutor also stated that the defendant Rogers also suffered a minor injury to his left forehead. According to his statement, he was injured by Cheng Rongfang with an iron ring. However, he could not provide the iron ring or other evidence, which was insufficient to be credible. Furthermore, because the victim only identified Rogers as the assailant, and the investigation confirmed that there were no other accomplices, the other relevant people are not intended to be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Ohrdruf Agency Case Concluded: 21 Defendants Make Final Arguments; Await Decision on the 17th to Determine Fate</h3>
<p>(Report from Our Newspaper) After months of continuous trials by the US military court in the Ohrdruf Agency spy case (Nazi intelligence agency in China), in addition to Shen Ke and six others who have been declared innocent, the remaining 21 defendants were announced in court yesterday to be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 17th. That time will mark the complete end of the case. All defendants, whether guilty or innocent, will be repatriated to their home countries for execution.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last hearing in the case. Both sides debated fiercely. The speakers for the prosecution were Colonel O'Connor and Major Du Hua, while the speakers for the defense lawyers included lawyer Jiang Yiping, lawyer Prime, and Lieutenant Colonel Labor.</p>
<p>Colonel O'Connor believed that the 21 people in the defendant's seat could be seen as a microcosm of Nazi Germany. This organized group has been engaged in secret activities in China since 1941. After Germany surrendered, they believed that Japan, a member of the Axis powers, could still win in the Far East, so espionage work continued unabated. Their secret radio stations in South China intercepted information about the Allied Air Force, resulting in countless casualties among our pilots. Their Beijing branch provided the Japanese with information about the absence of Soviet troops on the Manchurian border, which emboldened the Japanese to act.</p>
<p>Major Du Hua, based on the findings of the investigation and the testimony of witnesses in previous court sessions, pointed out that all the defendants of the Ohrdruf Agency continued to engage in espionage work after Germany surrendered, violating the laws of war and were undoubtedly war criminals.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jiang Yiping defended Pu Kaimai, the former director of the Shanghai German News Agency, arguing that there was no evidence to prove that Pu Kaimai provided military intelligence to the Japanese after Germany surrendered.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jinlem also argued that there was no accurate fact that would allow the prosecutor to point at the defendant and say, "This is part of your military cooperation with the Japanese," or "This is the military activity you were engaged in." Therefore, he believed that his clients, Fuerkele and Haixue, could not be called war criminals.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Layou similarly argued that the prosecutor's office had failed to present sufficient evidence and believed that the accusation that the Shanghai part of the Ohrdruf Agency continued to work after Germany surrendered could not be established.</p>
<p>Luo Men, a former staff member of the Shanghai German News Agency and one of the defendants, also defended himself yesterday, requesting the court to acquit him. He admitted that he had printed propaganda pamphlets, but these pamphlets were never distributed to the front lines, so in fact they did not cause any loss or harm to the United Nations.</p>
<p>After the debate, the 21 defendants were dejectedly remanded in custody, awaiting the decision that would determine their future fate this Friday.</p>
<h3>General Huang Jie's Interview: A Refined General with a Distinguished Air Who Has Fought a Hundred Battles; Shedding Tears at Dachang</h3>
<p>[Exclusive Interview by This Newspaper] General Huang Jie (see photo taken by our reporter), known for his refined air, recently took time out from his position as the Education Director of the Central Training Corps to come to Shanghai to preside over the opening ceremony of the Shanghai branch of the corps. General Huang returned to Nanjing after the war last year and has been busy with the duties of the Central Training Corps. The day before yesterday was his first time in Shanghai after the victory. Ten years is not a long time, and the people of Shanghai are familiar with General Huang Jie, who defended Dachang at the beginning of the War of Resistance. This trip to Shanghai also carried a sense of remembrance for General Huang.</p>
<p>General Huang was one of the most prominent graduates of the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy. Looking through old newspapers from the autumn of 1937, it can be seen that in addition to commanding operations in the trenches, General Huang often brought his "impromptu poems" to reporters for publication. This signified a unique calmness and courage on the front line of life and death, and its side effect was to encourage morale and stabilize people's hearts.</p>
<p>General Huang is from Changsha, Hunan, and his Mandarin has a heavy Hunan accent. The reporter had the opportunity to visit him for the first time at a cocktail party yesterday. Dressed in a grey-green long silk robe, which complemented his fair and rosy complexion, he appeared very refined. If not for the introduction, no one would know that he was General Huang Jie, who had fought hundreds of battles. He talked a lot with the reporter about the issue of officer demobilization. The Central Training Corps was responsible for training party and government personnel during the war, and now it is an institution for officer demobilization training. General Huang has been shouldering this difficult task since the victory the year before last. Officer demobilization and returning to civilian professions is not difficult in foreign countries. Due to China's military service system and national financial issues, it is not possible for this large number of officers to obtain suitable jobs after being discharged from the army. However, the government, in view of their wartime achievements, will naturally provide them with reasonable placement, not to mention that national construction requires a large amount of manpower. According to General Huang's estimates, there are 200,000 demobilized officers after the war, including 30,000 who are overage, injured, and retired; 70,000 who have passed the vocational transfer examination; 30,000 selected as cadres by the Gold Country Division and Garrison Area; 22,000 selected as reserve officers; 26,000 assigned to various provinces for training; and more than 10,000 others who volunteer to serve in the Northeast or participate in military news work.</p>
<p>During the September 18th Incident, General Huang served as the commander of the 2nd Division and fought against the enemy at Gubeikou. During the August 13th Incident, he served as the commander of the Air Tax Police General Regiment and the commander of the Xuhai Garrison. Not long after, he was promoted to commander of the 8th Army and transferred to Shanghai to fight. Of the more than 20,000 men he led, only over 500 remained when they finally withdrew from Shanghai. General Huang stayed in Shanghai for three days this time. He spent two days working at the Shanghai branch office, and yesterday morning he made a special trip to the "ancient battlefield" of Dachang to pay his respects. According to his secretary, Wang Luchang, General Huang lingered in front of the graves of his subordinates in Dachang and eventually shed his "heroic tears." He decided to build an immortal memorial tower in Dachang for his subordinates who died in the War of Resistance. This is the meaning of military education, and he cherishes his subordinates as if they were his own children.</p>
<p>General Huang finished his official business in Shanghai and is scheduled to take a train back to Nanjing this morning to attend the officers' general team compilation meeting of the Central Training Corps.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Returns to His Post in the Northeast; Departs Shanghai for Tianjin on the Changcheng Ship</h3>
<p>The famous anti-Japanese general, Ma Zhanshan, currently the Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Command, came to Shanghai for medical treatment a week ago. He has now recovered and boarded the Changcheng ship of the Fumin Shipping Company at the Huangpu Wharf on the Bund at 7:00 yesterday morning to go to Tianjin and return to his post in the Northeast. Yesterday morning, hundreds of representatives from all walks of life in the city and Ma's relatives and friends came to the wharf to welcome him, all holding flags with the words "Farewell to General Ma Zhanshan" and setting off firecrackers. Ma, dressed in a blue robe and a black woolen coat with a fur collar, looked radiant. He arrived at the wharf at 7:00 a.m., shook hands with the welcomers and said goodbye, and told reporters that he hoped for the early realization of peaceful reunification. At 7:30 a.m., the Changcheng ship left the wharf amidst the sound of firecrackers.</p>
<h3>The Police Bureau Intensifies Winter Defense; A People's Security Conference Will Be Held</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, stated at a press conference yesterday: The Lunar New Year is approaching, and in the current situation of economic depression, the number of unemployed people has increased. At the same time, local ruffians, vagrants, and idlers have not been thoroughly eliminated. In addition, the criminals who were recently released from prison after being granted amnesty are still wandering the streets, without a place to go, which has greatly affected the security of the city. Although the police bureau has mobilized all police officers from various branches, as well as the Security Police General Team, mobile units, volunteer police brigades, and police training school students to fully undertake security duties, it is hoped that citizens throughout the city will pay attention to prevention in advance and maintain contact with the police bureau at any time so that thieves and robbers have no opportunity to take advantage of. The police bureau will also convene people's security conferences in various districts starting today to explain the knowledge of theft prevention, and use radio broadcasts and slide advertisements to publicize widely.</p>

<h3>Dentist Situ Bo's Land Rent Case; Judgment Yesterday: Payment Increased by a Thousandfold</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The land of 9.43% owned by landlord Xie Zixian at the corner of Linsen Middle Road and Madang Road, rented to dentist Situ Bo, had a land rent of 560 yuan per year before the war. Recently, Xie sued Situ Bo in the local court, requesting an increase in the payment of this year's rent to 1.2 million legal tender in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery. The local court concluded the trial on the 9th of this month, and the verdict was announced at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The main text of the judgment stated: "The defendant, Situ Bo, shall pay the plaintiff 560,000 legal tender for the land rent of the year 1947. The remainder of the plaintiff's claims is dismissed. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant, except for the part borne by the intervenor." It is noted that the local court has ruled that pre-war deposits should be repaid at a rate of one thousand times the original amount as a standard. In this case, the pre-war land rent was originally set at 560 yuan per year, and now the judgment orders an increase in payment to 560,000 yuan, which is also approximately one thousand times the original amount.</p>

<h3>Striving for Light; Too Unfair; The Red Dancer; Shouldn't Steal</h3>
<p>Hu Ping, 23, and Hu Jinmo, 21, red dancers from the Great Eastern Stage, live together in a third-floor attic at No. 14 Yongshan Street. Although the room is small, it is exquisitely decorated. The room is equipped with a small electric meter, and the monthly usage reaches more than 30 degrees. Recently, due to the restriction of electricity usage, the light has become dark. Therefore, Hu and others instructed an electrician to connect the electric wire to the main switch. As a result, although the electric lights are lit as much as possible, the number of degrees has been greatly reduced, only two or three degrees per month. This was discovered by Mrs. Wang Huang, the second landlord of the house, who broke into their room at 9:00 p.m. the night before to check the small electric meter and discovered the theft of electricity. Therefore, all nine households of the tenants attacked them. The two sides disagreed and fought each other. Later, the police officers arrived and took them to the police station together. First, the informants stated the previous situation, and said that the defendants had lit hundreds of light bulbs in the room. How could it be that they only used one degree in two weeks? When questioned, Hu Ping said that the electric wire was actually repaired by the electrician, and it was not that we deliberately told him to connect it illegally. The police also summoned the electrician for questioning, and then sent the two Hus to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Various Factories Visit President Song; Discuss and Decide on Adjusting Flour Prices; And Allocate 60,000 Bags of Lilan Flour</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Five major flour mills in this city, including Fuxin, Zaofeng, Huafeng, Maoxin, and Yutong, have gradually reduced production due to production costs, which has hindered the daily allocation of 12,000 bags of flour needed by various industries in this city. At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu specially summoned representatives of various factories at the municipal government, including Rong Yiren, Xi Debing, Bian Xiaoqing, Qian Shouchun, Wu Limen, and Gu Zhunian, chairman of the Flour Business Association, and Zhang Chao, standing director. However, no results were achieved in the discussion on adjusting the negotiated price. Mayor Wu accompanied the representatives of various factories to visit President Song. After the meeting, it was decided to adjust the negotiated price of domestic flour to 25,000 yuan per bag, and foreign Lilan flour (70 pounds) to 37,000 yuan per bag. The allocation price of the Flour Business Association, including transportation, is 26,000 yuan per bag for domestic flour and 38,500 yuan per bag for Lilan flour. This price will be maintained temporarily until the end of January of this year. Also, since domestic flour is insufficient for distribution before the Lunar New Year, it was decided that various factories should first supply 60,000 bags of Lilan flour for allocation by the Flour Business Association.</p>
<h3>As the Lunar New Year Approaches, the Financial Situation Is Still Good; All Banks Have Profits; The Exchange Situation Is Good</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] After the accounts of various banks in this city were settled in 1946, the general situation was still good. Except for those that went bankrupt before the year, the large ones, depending on the size of their capital and the amount of deposits, had profits ranging from 40-50 million yuan to 500 million yuan. At present, the general financial situation does not seem to have changed much, and various banks should be able to get through the Lunar New Year safely.</p>
<p>According to news from the city's clearing house: Although the Lunar New Year is approaching, the exchange situation in various banks has been good in recent days, and there has been no case of overdrafts. The number of returned checks has also not increased.</p>
<h3>Deposit Reserves Reduced; The Central Bank Has Returned the Balance</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The deposit reserve of various banks was originally 15% and 20%, but it was reduced to 10% and 15% starting in December of last year. However, the reserve was changed to cash. The remaining amount of the reserve has now been returned by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>The Banking Association Stipulates; Uniform Signature Samples</h3>
<p>The Banking Association has recently found that the formats and methods of signature samples sent by counterparties have varied, making it inconvenient for preservation and verification. It is learned that the banks in Chongqing, Hankou, and other places have unified the methods for signature samples of counterparties through the local banking associations. It is now learned that the Banking Association has repeatedly received letters from various counterparties requesting research and improvement in order to achieve uniformity. Therefore, after detailed research, it has drafted a "Draft of Uniform Signature Sample Methods," with four pages of signature styles, and sent it to the Banking Association for circulation to counterparties for uniform adoption in order to achieve uniformity.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Distributes According to Quota; The Yarn Market Is Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market declined sharply. The yarn market was already depressed, and in addition, Textile Construction announced last night that all yarn requested for purchase would be fully allocated according to the quota, regardless of the factory number. Those who were thin on funds were all selling at reduced prices. 20-count yarn fell by 100,000, and 42-count double-ply was particularly miserable, falling by as much as 350,000.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit; Cloth Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened in the morning due to the approaching closing period and tight credit. There were many sellers, which caused fine cloth to fall across the board. Five Fortune fine cloth was once quoted at 110,000 yuan, and Three A Colorful Ball was quoted at 108,000 yuan. By the time the market closed, it was heard that Textile Construction had stopped opening fine cloth, and the price rose by 1,000 to 2,500 yuan. As a result, it was slightly lower than the previous day, down 500 to 1,000 yuan. However, Five Fortune fine cloth rose by 2,500 yuan compared to the previous day due to the scarcity of spot goods. Each grade of Shilin was still stable.</p>
<h3>Rayon Declines Again; The Factory Silk Market Is Very Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market declined again. Because the China Trust Bureau's allocation has been implemented yesterday, the black market depreciated, which was expected. 120-count Asahi-brand shiny rayon was quoted at 3.4 million yuan at the opening in the morning, and was once quoted as high as 4.44 million yuan. In the end, due to a lack of buyers, it closed at 3.5 million yuan, down 170,000-180,000 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, it was quoted at 4 million yuan outside the market, but no transactions were made. Other half-point goods also lacked transactions, and there were no quotations. The factory silk market was very quiet. Most of the silk houses have already balanced their positions and are unwilling to sell. Those who need money and want to sell have reduced their prices. Yesterday's market was not much different from the previous day. The quotations and transaction prices of silk fabrics were very different. The quotations in yesterday's market were not much different from the previous day. Although the price of rayon was small, the price of Huajin crepe was still quoted at 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Foreign Currency Circulation; Unprecedented in Other Countries; Should Be Banned Urgently; Opinions from the Financial Sector</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The National Federation of Commerce and Industry has suggested to the government to prohibit the circulation of foreign currency within the country. The reporter asked the person in charge of the financial sector about this matter. According to a responsible person of the Central Bank: The circulation of foreign currency within the country is originally extremely unreasonable. No independent country in the world expressly permits the circulation of foreign currency within the country. Therefore, the circulation of foreign currency in China is an unreasonable fact. The current problem is how to eliminate this fact. However, to reduce this fact, a single order cannot be effective. If only a clear prohibition is used, it is inevitable that it will circulate secretly, causing many abuses. Therefore, to ban foreign currency circulation, a thorough and effective method must be devised to achieve a permanent solution. According to a member of the Shanghai Bank, prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency within the country is a reasonable suggestion, and the government should adopt it in principle. However, there will inevitably be difficulties in its implementation. Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency must be done carefully, and cannot be changed frequently. The speculative trickery of the Chinese people is often unimaginable, and strict prevention is also necessary. At present, the number of wealthy merchants in China who have deposits abroad is extremely large, and the situation of China's finances itself is very complicated. Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency is only a small part of it.</p>
<h3>Longan Pulp Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Shima dried longan pulp had previously risen by 20-30% due to shortages. Now that a batch has arrived on the Haixiang ship, and the approaching end of the year is also imminent, merchants are not greedy, and the price has eased slightly. Yesterday, merchants only released a dozen boxes, and the rebound was weak, at just under 7%.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Gold Market Was Calm; Bond and Stock Markets Also Showed Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Gold Was Stable; Foreign Currencies Were Mediocre; Gold was still stable yesterday, hovering without much change. It opened in the morning at 3.71 million, and was first seen at the high price of 3.73 million. The Central Bank sold at the high price, and it once spun and fell. Before long, the 3.7 million mark could not be supported, and the low price was around 3.67 million. After struggling for a long time, the Central Bank allocated 140 bars at a price of 3.68 million. Afterwards, the supply suddenly became sluggish and restabilized. After 11:00, it crossed the 3.7 million mark again, and stood at around 3.73 million at noon. In the afternoon, the Central Bank tightened controls, so it was unable to rise. From 3.72 million, it gradually fell back, and some yarn industry insiders supplied it, so it looked tired when the market closed. As a result, it fell by 25,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold was 394,000, and the hidden interest rate was still around 1.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies were extremely mediocre. The black market price of US dollars was 6,500-6,600 yuan. From morning to noon, it struggled at this price and there were no special changes. In the afternoon, it was stable with little change, and still hovered around 6,500-6,600 yuan. As a result, it was no different from the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar also had no gains or losses. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still quoted at 1,200-1,220 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 1,460-1,480 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 19,200-19,400 yuan. Except for the Indian and British exchange rates, only the Hong Kong exchange rate had some transactions.</p>
<p>Bonds Hovered</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Were Dazed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market was still hovering. There were sellers of 360-series and 503-series, and scattered buying was still active. Tongbing opened in the morning and rose to 2,200 yuan. The low price in the middle was 2,120 yuan. Finally, it hovered around 2,150 yuan. Compared with the previous close, Jiayi and Yi were flat, Tongbing fell slightly by 20 yuan, and Tongding and Tongwu each rose by 50 yuan. The transaction volume was 3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was a short-term confrontation between the long and short sides of Chinese stocks. Large outside-the-market players were frantically selling, while 221 was frantically buying large quantities of current delivery Yong yarn in the market, and the market was chaotic and slightly dazed. The opening price of each stock in the morning was slightly lower. After opening, 232, 76, 83, 87, 47, and 180 entered, rising to 773 yuan. 224, 152, 14, 198, and 89 sold and fell by more than 10 yuan. 219, 4, 16, 172, and 232 entered, 15 and 145 entered current delivery Yong yarn. Qinxing was bought by 198 and rose to the limit, spinning and rising. Deferred delivery rose to 790 yuan, and current delivery rose to 777 yuan. Unexpectedly, after that, it entered a dogfight stage. 231, 213, and 154 frantically sold current delivery Yong yarn. 224 and 231 also sold deferred delivery Yong yarn. 212 suddenly came into the market to collect a large number of more than one million shares of current delivery Yong yarn, while large outside-the-market players suppressed it. After the high price of 785 yuan of current delivery was seen, it was finally suppressed because the outside-the-market quotation was very low. The noon market was the most tired, and it ended with a stalemate. Compared with the previous close, Yong yarn, Meiya, and Huafeng were slightly stable, Xinhe and Xinguang rose by more than 5%, Qinxing rose by 10%, Jingfu fell slightly, and among the unpopular stocks, Zhongfang, Match, and Jinglun fell slightly. The rest rose and rose by up to 5%. Deferred delivery of Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, and Huafeng rose slightly, Qinxing rose by 10%, and Yong yarn fell slightly. In the afternoon, 3 did not enter, and 154 also bought current delivery, seeing high prices of 785 yuan for deferred delivery and 770 yuan for current delivery. 156 and 173 came to Yi for current delivery Miaoyun, and 198, 185, and 152 sold deferred delivery Miaoyun from time to time, and saw a low price of 762 yuan. 22, 186, 231, and 30 entered, 4 exited and then entered again, and once rose to above 775 yuan. 152, 83, and 197 sold off, and were about to withdraw into 770 yuan when the market closed. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yong yarn, Xinhe, Jingfu, and Huafeng rose slightly, Meiya fell slightly, Xinguang rose by less than 10%, Dongxing rose by 10%, and among the unpopular stocks, Cement, Lian, Wuhe, Underwear, and Zhongsi Yonggong Rongfeng and Tongyi all rose. Match and Mutong were flat, and Jinglun, Zhongfang, and Xinya fell. Each stock in the outside market, such as Dasheng, continued to rise, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks were slightly stable, but the ups and downs of each stock were more erratic. Yisha once approached the 9,000 yuan mark. Compared with the previous close, Meilian Copper rose by more than 5%, Yeguang, Shipping, and Paper were flat, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Upright Coal Exhibits Excellence</h3>
<p>In the coal market, white coal, Hongji lump coal, has active sales. The arrival of Jiaozuo lump coal at the station is relatively low, and the market price is rising. For Pingdingshan Coal Mine No. 2 bituminous coal, the factory shareholders are frequently absorbing it at low prices, and the market price is rising rapidly. Lump coal prices are also rising accordingly. The distribution of coal briquettes at the government price of 5,000 tons in the first batch will begin within the year. Currently, the Shanghai Coal Briquette Retailers Joint Office has a total of 1,200 registered members, divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A is allocated 7 tons, Grade B is 5 and 1/4 tons, Grade C is 3 and 1/2 tons, and Grade D is 1 and 3/4 tons.</p>
<p>[Further News] The Coal Briquette Price Stabilization Committee previously decided that the distribution would start on the 15th. It is reported that due to the rush of preparation time, it is feared that only the payment and collection procedures for retailers can be handled this morning, and the coal briquettes will be available on the market in the afternoon. The procedures for purchasing coal briquettes will still be as previously determined, based on the household registration card. Each household can purchase one "dan" (a unit of weight) from retailers (not limited to the region), and the price is 11,000 yuan per "dan". The sales method of coal briquettes in the various outlets of the Guohua Coal Briquette Factory is also handled in the same way as other retailers.</p>

<h3>China Production Promotion Association: Safeguarding Small-Scale Manufacturers</h3>
<p>Li Jishen, Mao Qingxiang, Pan Gongzhan, Hu Boxiang, and others, the leaders of the China Production Promotion Association, in view of the recent precarious situation of domestic goods manufacturers and the cumbersome procedures for government-sponsored production loans, which most small and medium-sized factories do not meet, in order to maintain the market and care for the people's livelihood, specially initiated the organization of the "Shanghai Municipal Temporary Committee for the Protection of Small-Scale Manufacturers" to assist small-scale manufacturers in getting through the New Year. All factories and merchants who have finished products, raw materials, and commodities that do not meet the eligibility for production loans but need to borrow money can register with the association, and the association will allocate and introduce them to the supporting banks and firms for direct handling. The interest rate will be particularly favorable, and it is requested that they be allowed to pledge goods. Yesterday, the association distributed requests for assistance to various banks and money houses and scheduled to host news reporters at the association at 2 pm today.</p>

Yao Zhicheng (No. 169), Yan Junrong (No. 101), Huang Chongye (No. 15), Chen Yonglin (No. 213), and Liu Xifan (No. 9) were elected as representatives to negotiate with the exchange based on reason.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Market: Four Major Department Stores Experience Dull Business</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The major department stores in this city are feeling difficult to sustain due to sluggish business and labor disputes. At the end of last year, the employees of the four major department stores, in addition to demanding double pay and bonuses, also demanded a loan of 300,000 yuan per person. After repeated consultations between labor and management, it has been decided to issue loans, but the amount will be reduced accordingly. Currently, among the major companies, Wing On Company has the highest turnover, but the daily turnover is only over 80 million yuan, and other companies are far less than this number, so they have to attract customers by means of price reductions and gifts. According to the person in charge of the Joint Office of the Ten Major Department Stores, most of the department stores in this city are currently relying on inventory to get by, which is indeed an unprecedented difficult period for the major companies.</p>
<h3>Transportation Industry Granted Continued Tax Exemption for One Year Yesterday: Taxes Already Paid to be Refunded</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Transportation Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the industry had served the country during the war and made great sacrifices. During the post-war recovery period, it was also responsible for military and public transportation, undertaking the task of post-war recovery, and bearing heavy responsibilities. It requested that the previous practice of exempting business tax for one year be continued. This request was approved by the Ministry of Finance yesterday, and the transportation industry tax will continue to be exempted for one year from October 1946 to September 1947. Taxes already paid will be refunded.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Sales are Quiet</h3>
<p>The sales of woolen fabrics are now coming to an end. Customers in this street no longer have formal demand, and the market is usually weak. Except for a few stores, most are burdened with high-interest loans. There are only a very few with sufficient capital. Therefore, there are fewer people who absorb and purchase cheaply in advance than in the past. Except for spring flannels, all prices are openly flat and secretly reduced. After the final settlement of 1946, except for the stores on Qipan Street, which have considerable profits, the gains of other large and small stores are less than the losses.</p>
<h3>Cooking Oil Rationing Continues as Usual</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Cooking Oil Joint Distribution Office will soon come to an end since it began rationing cooking oil from various private factories. It is reported that the chairman of the office, Zhang Chao, will pay a visit to Mayor Wu tomorrow to discuss the timely allocation of 5,000 "dan" of cooking oil from state-owned oil factories that have already been agreed to be allocated for distribution, in order to maintain the people's food supply. Yesterday, the office distributed a total of 863 "dan" of cooking oil.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture Establishes Committee for Improvement</h3>

The main tasks of the committee will include: (1) Selecting and managing foreign cotton seeds; (2) Assisting in supplying raw materials to farmers in cotton-producing areas; (3) Reviewing and planning improved cotton seed planting areas; (4) Studying technical issues related to cotton production.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Silk Industry: Production Loans Approved for Participation; Joint Venture Company Established Today</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Industry Association has recently reached an agreement with the Production Loan Association that, in addition to the fact that the larger factories in the industry can apply for loans, other small and medium-sized factories have now been invited to participate in the application for loans. Therefore, it is hoped that member factories of the association who need loans can apply to the Production Loan Association separately.</p>
<p>[Further News] The Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Stock Company, after active preparation, is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Kangle Restaurant at 3 pm today. At that time, the company's articles of association will be adopted, and directors and supervisors will be elected.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Sugar Softens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market softened again. The association's division showed that the spot price for medium white sugar was 138,000 to 9,000 yuan, down 3-4,000 yuan. Warehouse receipts were 133,000 to 5,000 yuan, small 4-5,000 yuan, medium sugar was 127,000 to 6,500 yuan, small sugar was 2-3,000 yuan, warehouse receipts were 121,000 yuan, small 4-5,000 yuan, Shunde green sugar was 98-9,000 yuan, with little change.

<h3>Tea Sales are Quiet</h3>
<p>Domestic sales of black and green tea are dull because customers are not taking deliveries, and the stores on this street are also very inactive in selling. The situation is dim. In the foreign tea market, the high-end Chen Qimen tea favored by British Jardine Matheson has quiet negotiation but no agreement. As for the Zhenzhen and Zhenmei green teas sold to Africa, the shipping dates are approaching, and the export firms are busy handling export procedures, so the momentum of inquiry is weaker than before, and transactions are rare. In terms of prices, they are as firm as before. Other varieties are evenly matched in terms of imports and exports, with little unique quality.</p>
<h3>Directors and Supervisors of Zhejiang Provincial Bank Elected</h3>
<p>It is learned that the current board of directors of Zhejiang Provincial Bank was held in Hangzhou on January 10 this year.

Zheng Wenli, Xu Shaodi, and Yang Yun were elected as standing supervisors, a total of three people. As for the candidates for chairman and general manager, it is said that the Ministry of Finance will designate them from the standing directors.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Implements Plant Import Inspection</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the spread of plant diseases, bacteria, and pests, the Taiwan Provincial Government has announced and implemented two orders: the "Regulations for the Prohibition of Imports" and the "Regulations for the Inspection of Special Plants." All kinds of plants entering and leaving the island must be released after inspection and approval.</p>
<h3>National Insurance Industry's Premium Income Exceeded 100 Billion Last Year: Foreign Reinsurance Accounted for 60%</h3>
<p>According to an authoritative source in the insurance industry, the total premium income of the national insurance industry last year exceeded 100 billion yuan. However, more than 60% of this income was reinsured by Chinese companies to foreign companies. Therefore, the loss of foreign exchange from our premiums last year is quite noteworthy. In view of this, the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association initiated the organization of a savings group last year to control the outflow of premiums, but very few people participated in the group. Recently, Chinese companies have signed reinsurance contracts with foreign companies one after another, and the loss of foreign exchange cannot be estimated. If these reinsurance contracts can be handled in the same way as salt reinsurance, a lot of foreign exchange can be saved.</p>
<h3>Refined Rice Increases and Reduces Prices: The Oil Market is Said to Be Rising and Falling Slightly</h3>
<p>A total of 15,000 to 16,000 rice shipments arrived from both the north and south. The goods arrived in abundance, but the actual sales were dull. The price of medium and low-quality southern refined rice continued to fall by 1,000 yuan, while the price of high-quality rice remained flat. Northern refined rice was in short supply and stable. The arrivals were mostly southern refined rice, and the market was still in a state of increasing and reducing prices. Indica rice showed a mediocre trend. White rice and Yinyuan rice were actively sold, up by more than 1,000 yuan. The price of flour fell by 200-300 yuan due to the ample supply of foreign flour, and it was still hovering in a weak state. Bran continued to rise in price in the countryside, up by 300 yuan. The supply and demand of soybeans were both strong. This street had a very strong appetite. However, as the end of the year approached, the owners of Dazou soybeans were very eager to sell them, and the price dropped by 5-600 to 1,000 yuan. The market for Northeast soybeans became more and more stable, but the market situation showed both ups and downs. Soybean cakes and oil dregs were in great demand, up by 2-300 yuan. The oil market showed mixed ups and downs. Raw oil shops were cold and sluggish, and Ningbo shops were also weak, down by 1-2,000 yuan, showing a situation of rising and falling slightly. Sesame oil was still in demand, up by 3-4,000 yuan. Clear oil was fair. Soybean oil was not yet available due to a shortage of goods. Red beans were still sluggish, down by 1,000 yuan. Broad beans, horse beans, and corn from Qingdao were still dry and in demand, up by 3-400 yuan, and the market situation was firm. Raw peanuts were still lacking in price fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Sichuan's Finances are Extremely Difficult: Education is on the Verge of Total Collapse: More than 40 Presidents and Principals of Specialty and Middle Schools Resign Jointly</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch] Under the extremely difficult financial conditions in Sichuan Province this past year, education is on the verge of total collapse. Last year, the post-war rehabilitation funds for education in Sichuan Province were 800 million yuan, but the Central Government only allocated 450 million yuan, and the Sichuan Department of Finance deducted 200 million yuan, only allocating 250 million yuan, resulting in the inability of dozens of schools to rehabilitate and the extreme shortage of funds. For this reason, Liu Ming, the director of the Department of Education, has firmly resigned to the provincial government and is currently being retained by Acting Chairman Deng and the Sichuan Provincial Assembly. In addition, more than 40 presidents and principals of provincial specialty and middle schools in Sichuan Province, including Yang Youzhi, have recently jointly petitioned the provincial government, stating that they are unable to promote education due to a lack of funds and requesting permission for all to resign. The future of education in Sichuan Province is truly worrying.</p>

<h3>Hu Shuyi Returns to China: Talks About Inspection Experience</h3>
<p>Educational expert Mr. Hu Shuyi, who was ordered by the Ministry of Education to go to the United Kingdom and the United States to inspect education, returned to Shanghai from the United States the other day. Director Gu of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and educators and journalists successively held banquets at the International Hotel and the Yu Restaurant on Sanma Road to welcome him. Mr. Hu took the night train to Beijing today to report to the Ministry of Education. Yesterday, he released his inspection experience to reporters as follows: This time, he was ordered to inspect major cities in England, America, and Canada, such as London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Oxford, Cambridge, and Birmingham in England; Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Missouri in the United States; and Ottawa, Montreal, and Toronto in Canada. He visited more than 300 universities, middle schools, and other educational institutions, and collected extremely practical educational materials. Moreover, because he had been engaged in journalism for many years, he also visited the Times in London, the New York Times and the Daily News in New York, and the United Press, Reuters, and Associated Press news agencies. The US State Department's Information Bureau invited him to broadcast his impressions of visiting the United States to the Shanghai area and to attend the annual meetings of various academic groups.</p>
<p>……University Education……</p>
<p>Oxford University and Cambridge University in England are the most outstanding institutions of higher learning in England, and they are also the highest organs for training "British gentlemen." These two universities each have more than 20 colleges, forming university towns in Oxford and Cambridge. They are quiet and simple, and are indeed good places for young people to study and relax. The University of London is a modern university in England. Its modern architecture and equipment, the number of departments and students are very similar to modern universities in the United States. The famous middle schools in England are Eton and Harrow, which form a system with Oxford and Cambridge and can be said to be the primary training institutions for "British gentlemen."</p>
<p>……Primary Education……</p>
<p>Primary education in England is the most practical and effective. The good physique and good habits of the British are cultivated in elementary schools. Recently, pre-school education has been included in the formal education system. From the age of two, they receive independent and consistent basic training education, which is universally implemented throughout the country. The calm and experienced British Empire's performance in the previous wars can be said to be the success of elementary school basic training. Elementary and secondary education in the United States fully demonstrates the spirit of freedom and liveliness. Service, helping others, and the training of national life are the success of elementary and secondary education. Both England and the United States attach great importance to normal schools for teacher training. On the one hand, they train future teachers, and on the other hand, they guide the in-service training of current teachers. Therefore, guidance is a very important responsibility of normal schools in England and the United States.</p>
<p>……Women's Education……</p>
<p>Women's education in England and the United States focuses on household affairs training and children's education, which are very similar to our country's educational purpose of good mothers and are worthy of attention. The salaries of elementary and secondary school teachers in England and the United States are very similar. In the US education sector, there is a common and consistent requirement across the country that the treatment of elementary and secondary teachers be the same. As for seniority pay increases and various excellent treatment methods, England and the United States have gradually implemented them.</p>
<p>……Adult Education……</p>
<p>England and the United States advocate "Lifelong Learning," so adult continuing education is very developed. Whether in rural or urban areas, schools are open, providing citizens with opportunities to use them day and night. The age and time of learning are extended. On the one hand, higher education is extended to improve the quality of education, and on the other hand, the time of learning is extended, and pre-school education is included in the formal education system to strengthen basic national education. Parents and children learn education in the same school at the same time, with the only difference being the time and content of learning. This is commonplace in England and the United States. School socialization, treating schools as the central organs for improving society, has several pilot zones in England called "Community Centers," with remarkable achievements that are worthy of emulation.</p>

<h3>Last Night's Basketball League: Unexpected Delight in a Comeback Victory; Shantou Team Overwhelms the Navy and Marine Corps Youth; Elsewhere, Huayang Easily Defeats the Shanghai Railway Team</h3>
<p>The second Basketball League held two Class A matches yesterday starting from 6:30 PM at the Municipal Gymnasium. Despite a small audience, the games were quite exciting. As a result, in the Class A Second Division match, Huayang defeated the Shanghai Railway team with a score of 59 to 36. In the Class A First Division match, the Shantou team staged a comeback, defeating the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team with a score of 40 to 37. The game details are as follows:</p>
<p>The opening match featured Huayang against the Shanghai Railway team from Class A Second Division. The Railway players lacked effective offense and defense, and their techniques were poor. They relied heavily on footwork, causing the Huayang players to frequently roll on the ground with the ball. The Huayang players excelled at long-range shots, hitting the basket with precision. At the start of the game, Ji Youkun from Huayang scored under the basket, opening the scoring. Sun Mingxin added to the lead, making it 4-0. After Chen Enrong from the Railway team scored with a long-range shot, Sun Mingxin from Huayang scored again. When Song Qihou left the court, Wang Huating substituted. The Railway team lacked coordination, and Huayang relentlessly pressured them, scoring repeatedly. Wu Binghao, Han Longhai, and Li Yao from the Railway team struggled valiantly. By the end of the first half, Huayang led with a score of 22 to 15.</p>
<p>After switching sides, Liu Benqin from Huayang quickly scored two points, followed by Dong Zhongyi, adding six points rapidly and creating a strong momentum. The Railway team was at a loss, resulting in a score of 49-30. Sun Mingxin and Song Qihou from Huayang re-entered the game. At the end of regulation time, Huayang easily defeated the Shanghai Railway team with a score of 59-36.</p>
<p>The final match was between the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team and the Shantou team. The Navy and Marine Corps Youth team, composed of foreign players, was tall and strong, employing a man-to-man defense. They lined up on the court, resembling a pagoda and city wall. The young players of the Shantou team struggled to penetrate their defense. However, they managed to turn defeat into victory, exceeding expectations. At the start of the game, Cai Yanxiong from the Shantou team scored the opening point with a free throw. Folack from the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team scored with a long-range shot, followed by five consecutive points. Pittman added to the lead, quickly making it 7-1. The Shantou team rallied, with Lin Weicong controlling the ball and making long-range shots, closing the gap to 5-7. The Navy and Marine Corps Youth team regained momentum. By the end of the first half, the Shantou team was behind with a score of 18 to 26.</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. Cai Yanxiong from the Shantou team made a shot, followed by two scores from Lin Weicong, closing the gap to 24-26. After the foreign player Pease scored, Lin Weipei from the Shantou team was injured and left the court. Chen Qingjiang substituted and re-entered the game. He Lide and Ji Nankang then scored successively, tying the game. The Shantou team began to see a turning point. The Navy and Marine Corps Youth team called a timeout, adjusting their players. Folack scored, regaining the lead. Cai Yanxiong from the Shantou team scored under the basket, and Chen Qingjiang scored two consecutive points, taking the lead for the first time with a score of 34-31. In the last four minutes, Chen Qingjiang scored again, and the foreign player Folack scored a point with a free throw. At the end of regulation time, the Shantou team staged a comeback, defeating the Navy and Marine Corps Youth team with a score of 40-37.</p>

<h3>Railway Interdepartmental Soccer Tournament: Transportation Department Heavily Defeats Accounting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The interdepartmental mini-soccer tournament for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway District, which had been suspended for several days due to continuous rain, resumed yesterday under clear skies. The match between the Transportation Department and the Accounting Department proceeded as scheduled, with Yan Yougeng as the referee. The Accounting Department took the offensive first. Young players Lu Hongji and Chen Daoxing coordinated their attacks, but were thwarted by Jin Ning from the Transportation Department. The ball was passed to Xiao Ziwen, who dribbled it to the right wing. Zhang Da tried to break through, but the Accounting Department's goalkeeper, Tang Wenwei, reacted quickly and dived to save the ball. The two fell in a heap, and Huang Haosheng seized the opportunity to score, opening the scoring for the Transportation Department. Shortly after, Xiao Ziwen from the Transportation Department received a pass from Qian Peng, dribbled past Huang Jinquan from the Accounting Department, and scored from about twenty yards away, making it 2-0. After conceding two goals, the Accounting Department tried hard to retaliate. Chen Daoxing and Lu Hongji made several attempts to score, but Qian Peng from the Transportation Department defended effectively, making it difficult for the Accounting Department to succeed. Later, Xiao Ziwen from the Transportation Department made a brilliant pass, and Huang Haosheng scored again, making it 3-0. Before the first half ended, Huang Haosheng scored his second goal, making it 4-0.</p>
<p>After switching sides, the Accounting Department brought in fresh players Zhang Zonglin and Zhou, while the Transportation Department called up Chen Da to strengthen their lineup. The two sides were evenly matched for twenty minutes without any scoring. In the last five minutes, the Transportation Department's three forwards became active again, causing more trouble in front of the Accounting Department's goal. Ultimately, due to the weakness of the Accounting Department's defense, Jin Ning from the Transportation Department scored again, bringing the final score to 5-0 in favor of the Transportation Department. Today's match will be between the Engineering Department and the Affairs Department.</p>

<h3>HVA Engineering Project Deputy Assistant Engineer &amp; Obstetrician Visit Shaanxi to Survey the Yellow River</h3>
<p>— Special dispatch from Xi'an, January 4th — Our Xi'an reporter Li Chi</p>
<p>The New Year should have been a three-day holiday, but on New Year's Day, more than twenty Chinese and American hydraulic engineering experts were still holding a symposium at the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, exchanging opinions enthusiastically with each other. Attendees included the world-renowned Dr. Savage and the twelve members of the Yellow River Advisory Group of the Supreme Economic Council. They seemed to have forgotten that this was a day of rest, and continued to concentrate on discussing the vast Yellow River that flows through nine provinces, and the "diagnosis" and "prescription" of the Fen, Luo, Jing, and Wei Rivers, which are related to the thorough treatment of the "Yellow River calamity" and cannot be ignored. The Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau provided thick volumes of data, countless pages of correspondence, and statistics.</p>
<p>As soon as the symposium was over, the thirteen members of the "Yellow Advisory Group" rushed to the airport and took a special plane back to Bian (Kaifeng), without a moment to spare. They stayed in Shaanxi for a total of eighteen days, traveled more than a thousand kilometers by road, and completed several hundred kilometers of aerial surveys, but did not publish their final conclusions.</p>
<p>Middle Reaches of the Yellow River</p>
<p>Let's start with the group's flight from Bian (Kaifeng) to Ningxia on the 13th of last month: that day, the special plane flew west along the Yellow River bed. Upon reaching Tongguan, it turned north and followed the Yellow River waterway at the junction of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, conducting low-altitude surveys in the famous Longmen and Hukou areas. Then it continued to fly north, crossing the area near Hequ, passing over Suiyuan to reach Ningxia.</p>
<p>During the day's journey, they quietly landed along the Wei River in E County to refuel, before flying north and west, exploring the upper reaches of the Yellow River and its water source areas.</p>
<p>Four days later (the 17th), they flew back to Xi'an from Lanzhou. That afternoon, they went to Lintong to take a hot spring bath and visit the site where the world-shaking "Xi'an Incident" occurred ten years and five days ago. They returned in the evening and stayed at the Xijing Hotel, which is also a historical building related to the "Xi'an Incident." They started their survey work after waking up the next morning. The itinerary was divided into four sections.</p>
<p>The first route was to inspect the middle reaches of the Yellow River. They passed through Hancheng and reached the Longmen area slightly north of the Yellow River-Fen River confluence on the 20th. On the return journey, they visited the Luo River and its water conservancy and irrigation projects. They originally planned to go further north to Hukou in Yichuan County, but the east bank of Hukou is in Jixian County, Shanxi, which is close to the war zone, so they had to give up. At the same time, according to the survey report of the Yellow River Harnessing Group two months ago, it was almost unanimously agreed that the value of Hukou was not as high as that of Longmen. (Please refer to the Xi'an correspondence "Hukou·Longmen" in the December 28th edition of this newspaper last year.) When they arrived on that day, the Yellow River, which had long been frozen, probably wanted to welcome the "doctors" who had come from thousands of miles away. The river ice unexpectedly thawed partially, and the splashing yellow water showed vitality and hope.</p>
<p>Dr. Savage is a cautious person to the two-hundredth degree. It is said that he never made even a partial preliminary conclusion on these thousands of miles of road after departing from Nanjing. This reporter only learned indirectly that he considered Shimen Gorge, north of Longmen, to be the most satisfactory location for building a dam among the sixty-five kilometers between Hukou, Longmen, and Yumen. Other Chinese and American experts conducted a precise and multi-faceted inspection there, but no one was willing to publish individual opinions and estimates upon their return. The combined conclusion may only be published after it has been sorted out and considered in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Shimen Gorge is also known as "Ba Biandan" by local residents, to describe how narrow the Yellow River is in this section. According to the latest opinions of Zhang Hanying from the "Yellow River Harnessing Group" and Liu Zhongrui and Guan Wenqi from the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau, they unanimously believe that the utilization value of Shimen Gorge is the greatest, and the future conclusion of the "Yellow Advisory Group" is likely to be very similar to this.</p>
<p>Mr. Sa and his party originally wanted to trace the upper reaches of the Luo River, but at present that area is in the control of Yan'an on the Chinese political map, so what they could see and reach was limited to the lower reaches of the Luo River and the irrigation benefit area of the "Lohui Canal." There, and in the "Jinghui Canal" benefit area, they saw the main cotton-producing area of Shaanxi Province, and highly praised the fact that the production volume per unit area of cotton fields in Shaanxi Province exceeds that of American cotton fields by several times. In fact, Shaanxi Province won the first prize in the country for increased cotton production this year, thanks to the improvement of varieties by agronomists, and to the irrigation provided by these canals.</p>
<p>The group returned to Xi'an, tired but mixed with excitement, on the eve of Christmas.</p>
<p>Upper Reaches of the Jing River</p>
<p>It is not to say that the "Yellow Advisory Group" spent the eve of 1946 here, and that the sixty-six-year-old white-haired Savage was already sixty-seven years old when he left Shaanxi and returned east. His birthday is the same day as Jesus Christ and the scientist Newton, and he happened to spend it in Xi'an this year. At noon that day, he held a silver knife and, with great joy, cut open a birthday cake made from wheat flour grown on the loess soil of Shaanxi.</p>
<p>The second survey route began on the 26th, following the highway to Na County in the upper reaches of the Jing River, and then northwest for forty kilometers to Tingkou. This is where the Jing River, the Malian River, and the Lingtai River meet. The river water is very turbulent, and some people used to think that it was extremely valuable to exploit, but this time the "Yellow Advisory Group's" opinion does not seem to give it such a high evaluation. The future conclusion may thoroughly revise the opinions of predecessors. However, the Jing River itself still has eighteen waterfalls downstream of Tingkou, which can all be used as hydropower. The source area of the Jing River also belongs to the "border area," and they did not go there for surveying.</p>
<p>The third route was on the 28th to the Baoji Gorge in the western section of the Wei River, fifteen kilometers west of Baoji. Mr. Savage expressed the same feeling about the future construction of a dam for power generation in this section of the river and was extremely satisfied. In his notebook, he has already drawn a sketch of the hydroelectric station in the Qinlong Plateau. They returned to Xi'an on the 29th, completing the entire survey work of the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>At this point in the description, it is necessary to briefly explain the "Yellow Advisory Group's" consideration and emphasis on the Luo, Jing, and Wei Rivers. At the same time, it can also explain the significance of the following fourth itinerary to inspect the Sanmen Gorge in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>Long before Savage and others came to China to conduct a field survey of the Yellow River, the Supreme Economic Council collected a lot of data in advance in the United States as preparation for the trip. However, many of our country's Yellow River management experts only focus on the lower reaches of the Yellow River, especially the area near Sanmen Gorge in Shanzhou, Henan, which is most valued. They believe that as long as a dam is built there, it can prevent flooding in the lower reaches and use the collected water to irrigate fields and generate electricity. However, other experts believe that the thorough management of the Yellow River must start from the upper and middle reaches first, otherwise it is still a palliative measure that does not address the root cause. With regard to the section of the Yellow River related to Shaanxi Province, Liu Zhongrui believes that the reason for the breach of the Yellow River in the lower reaches is closely related to the water of the Fen, Jing, and Wei Rivers. Therefore, to build dams to control the Yellow River water, one should start with the tributaries first. From the point of view of geology, hydrology, and transportation, the Jing, Wei, Luo, and Fen Rivers and the area near Longmen in the middle reaches of the Yellow River not only have many excellent dam construction sites; moreover, measured by the standards of economy, practicality, durability, etc., these locations are more ideal than the Sanmen Gorge. These two different views are a major topic in the management of the entire Yellow River, and cannot be easily concluded. In order to solve this question, the "Yellow Advisory Group" successively surveyed the Luo, Lian, and Wei Rivers in Shaanxi, and then ran east to the area along the river and spent two days inspecting near Shanzhou. This was their fourth trip. When they returned to Xi'an, it was exactly the last day of 1936! Of course, this big question cannot be concluded in one go. However, we learned late that the "Yellow River Management Group" believes that the Bali Hutong in Xin'an County, slightly east of Sanmen Gorge, still has a gorge that is more suitable for building a dam to store water than Sanmen Gorge.</p>
<p>Thirteen Advisors</p>
<p>The lineup of the thirteen members of the "Yellow Advisory Group" is "super": Mr. Savage does not need to be introduced again. Others such as Mr. Rebaude and Mr. Grotto are not well-known to ordinary people in China, but they are all first-class experts in the United States, just like the several Chinese consultants in the group, who are also leading figures in the "think tank" of their motherland's water conservancy undertaking. Some people think that the stay in Shaanxi for more than ten days is long enough, but insiders still think that it is only a preliminary "look at the flowers while riding a horse." Despite countless volumes of reference materials, one ruler and one foot thick, and countless large and small photos taken from land and air, it is still not enough to write the final conclusion, let alone a specific plan and the time of starting and completing construction. However, the great "Yellow River Valley Authority" (HVA) plan is undoubtedly being conceived on the slide rulers in the hands of experts.</p>
<p>Yes, science can overcome the Yellow River flood that began before Chinese history, but there are other conditions from blueprint to implementation, from implementation to achieving results. "Governing the Yellow River is not just a technical issue; putting China's entire economic and political issues on the right track is a prerequisite for all water conservancy construction." A senior official from the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Authority once told the reporter.</p>
<p>Why couldn't the "Yellow Advisory Group" go to Hukou and see the upper reaches of the Luo River and the Jing River this time?</p>
<p>Railway Hero: Ji, Director of the Western Section Management Office of the Ping-Sui Railway (Reported by our Suiyuan correspondent Liu Yingyuan)</p>
<h3>The Re-Creator of the Ping-Sui Railway: News from Gui Sui, 6th Day by Airmail, Our Correspondent in Sui, Liu Yingyuan</h3>
<p>Since the construction of the Ping-Sui Railway began, only two great engineering masters have emerged: one is Mr. Zhan Tianyou, who pierced through the thousands of mountains and valleys of Nankou, and the other is Director Su Jinin of the Western Section Management Office, who has been rushing to repair the damaged roadbeds along the entire line with the speed of a military advance. Zhan Tianyou built the Ping-Sui Railway by conquering the ocean of mountains and the desert; Su Jinin repaired the Ping-Sui Railway by finding the ocean in the desert. The former used scientific technology and civilized intelligence, while the latter used primitive perseverance and barbaric drive. Therefore, Su Jinin opened the railway to traffic one week after the siege of Sui Bao was lifted, within half a month after the siege of Datong was lifted, and within a month of the recovery of Zhangyuan, it reached Beiping and Chaigoubu. In less than two months, the entire Ping-Sui Railway was opened to traffic. This series of glorious achievements is comparable to the achievements of Zhan Tianyou and is considered a miracle by many. Therefore, people in society generally say: "Su Jinin is the re-creator of the Ping-Sui Railway."</p>
<p>Under the Flashes of Artillery Fire, Rushing to Repair the Railway</p>
<p>We cannot introduce Su Jinin's brilliant achievements without first explaining the cruelty of the Communist army towards the Ping-Sui Railway. Su Jinin took office as the director of the Western Section Management Office of the Ping-Sui Railway after Japan surrendered last year. The advance troops of the Second War Area entered Baotou on August 13th, and the Communist army immediately began to destroy the railway between Baotou and Datong. When Guo Changqing, the commissioner of Sui South, took over Gui Sui on the 18th, the Communist army first decided to besiege the provincial capital of Suiyuan and sent elite troops to block the eastward advance of the National Army at the Bikqi Township station, completely blowing up the nearby railway bridge, making it impossible for military vehicles to pass. It was raining heavily those days, and Director Su Jinin rushed to the front line with the army. Commander Fu ordered General Sun Lanfeng to drive out the bandits in Bikqi Township and gave him 24 hours to repair the railway. At that time, the railway workers had scattered and fled due to the war, so Su Jinin commanded the engineering soldiers of the troops to rush to repair the railway in 18 hours under the flashes of artillery fire. This allowed the reinforcements to reach Gui Sui quickly to relieve the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Su Jinin was admitted to the United States on government funding after graduating from the Department of Civil Engineering at Peking University in the sixth year of the Republic of China and transferred to the Department of Civil Engineering at R.P.I. University. After graduating in the ninth year of the Republic of China, he interned at the Walter Bridge Engineering Consultant Office. After returning to China in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, he successively served as the director of the Engineering Department of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau and the engineering technician of the Longhai and Zhengtai Railways. During the eight-year War of Resistance, when he worked underground for Commander Fu, traveling between Pingjin, Shanba, he understood the suffering of the railway employees. Therefore, after he took over the Western Section Management Office of the Ping-Sui Railway, he did not regard every employee in the occupied area as a traitor; instead, he paid special attention to their lives. At that time, the Ministry of Communications could not remit funds to Suiyuan, so Su Jinin borrowed money from Commander Fu to keep the employees well-fed. Therefore, they were willing to serve the country by restoring transportation under his leadership. Even though the Communist army destroyed it every day, the employees always repaired it every day. Before the Communist army launched a large-scale siege of Sui Bao on October 17th, the 1,000-li railway from Baotou to Datong was never interrupted.</p>
<p>Risking Great Danger to Negotiate for Locomotives</p>
<p>Last month, on the 17th, when the Communist army began to move in Sui Dong, Su Jinin personally risked great danger to negotiate with the Second War Area in Datong for four or five locomotives. If it were not for this stubborn bull, there would only be four military locomotives operating in the Western Section. When the Communist army besieged Baotou, he calmly completed the evacuation of the military station and unloaded the important parts of the locomotives to the city of Baotou, unlike the nine Jiang-class locomotives at the Datong military station, which were completely burned into scrap iron by the Communist army. The siege of Sui Bao was lifted in the twelfth lunar month of last year. The Communist army removed all the sleepers between Gui Sui and Taige, and no bridge or water tower between Sui Bao escaped serious damage. It was freezing cold at that time, with the temperature below zero. According to many people's estimates, it would take more than a month to restore traffic. No one thought that traffic would be restored within a week. The secret was that Su Jinin and the employees fought side by side on the icy and snowy fields. When his fingers were frozen purple, the employees below would not feel the cold. From that time on, the soldiers and civilians of Suiyuan began to recognize Director Su Jinin as not only a hardworking engineer but also a resolute general.</p>
<p>Disguised as a Merchant, Penetrating Deep into Enemy Lines</p>
<p>When Su Jinin was studying at the middle school of Shanxi University in the third year of Xuantong, he encountered the Xinhai Revolution. At that time, he and General Fu Zuoyi of the Army Primary School joined the Shanxi Student Army at the same time and went to Niangziguan to resist the Qing army, where he once served as a company commander. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, he retreated from the Zhengtai Road to Xi'an, breaking through the areas occupied and harassed by the enemy, puppets, and scattered soldiers, and ran to Hequ to follow Commander Fu in the war of resistance. When he met Fu Zuoyi in Wugong, he parted ways with Commander Fu in Xi'an and went to Pingjin for underground work via Hanoi and Hong Kong. It was not until after the Pearl Harbor Incident that he returned to Shanba from Tianjin. On the surface, he served as the chief engineering consultant of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, but in reality, he still traveled along the Ping-Sui Line to collect information about the enemy and puppets. He was of great help to Commander Fu in making combat decisions.</p>
<p>In February of the 33rd year, he was finally arrested in Tianjin by the military police sent by the Baotou Japanese Special Service Agency. Because Su Jinin's attitude was very tough, standing on the position of a Chinese, he engaged in a powerful debate with Tanaka, the person in charge of the Baotou Japanese Special Service Agency. As a result, the Japanese were overwhelmed by his慷慨激昂 spirit and did not kill him. Instead, they escorted him back to the National Army's defense line. Last year, when the news of the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan reached Shanba, Commander Fu again sent Su Jinin, disguised as a merchant, to enter Baotou by car to instigate the puppet army. On the night of August 10th, when the enemy accepted the Potsdam Declaration, he was the first to publicly run to the Japanese headquarters and happily inform them to surrender to the Twelfth War Area, almost being dragged out and shot by the enemy. However, the Kodama adviser of the Special Service Agency was finally persuaded by Su Jinin. Japan originally announced its surrender on the 15th, and the National Army would have to enter the city on the 16th at the earliest. They received the advance troops of the Twelfth War Area in Baotou on the night of the 13th. At that time, many people regarded "Su Jinin's tongue is equal to Commander Fu's three divisions" as a good story of surrender. It was also from that time that many people knew that the mysterious chief engineering consultant of Suiyuan was originally an unknown hero of the Twelfth War Area. From Su Jinin's extraordinary experience in the past, we can see that this offspring of a farming and studying family in Meiyang Town, Yishi County, Shanxi Province, not only has the temperament of a farmer and the cultivation of a worker but also has the decisiveness of a military officer and the demeanor and skill of a great politician.</p>
<h3>Carrying Two Railway Police While Fighting</h3>
<p>The employees of the Western Section of the Ping-Han Railway had completed various preparations for repairing the road in May because the train could only run from Baotou to Sandaoying before the Jining Campaign. However, they could not start construction for a long time, so everyone fell into the boredom of having nothing to do. During this stage, Su Jinin paid special attention to the cultural activities and learning atmosphere of the employees. He used the library and the theater to energize the minds of his colleagues. Therefore, when the Jining Campaign began, Su Jinin seemed to lead a group of lively and vigorous people to the front line. They quickly laid a roadbed of 60 li between Sandaoying and Zhuozishan under the range of the Communist artillery shells and the hidden guns of scattered bandits. After the National Army completely occupied Jining on September 14th, Su Jinin personally supervised the construction of the large bridge shortcuts of Xin'anzhuang and Sichengsi. On October 1st, he was the first to take two railway police officers, fighting the Communist army while walking in Baoziwan, and took the track-pressing vehicle to clean up the dilapidated situation of Datong Station. Many Datong employees who had no one to care for embraced and cried with him on the rubble of the burned locomotive field.</p>
<p>The Communist army saw that the repairs west of Datong were progressing rapidly, so they destroyed the railway between Datong and Zhangjiakou more thoroughly than between Sandaoying and Zhuozishan. In the entire length of 180 kilometers, more than 90 kilometers had no sleepers left. The rails were bent with ropes, the water towers were completely destroyed, and the platforms were all set on fire. They also used the valuable manpower to flatten the roadbed. Su Jinin arranged the project of Datong Yuhe Bridge and returned to Jining before Double Ten Day. He took a car to Zhangjiakou to repair the road. When he reached the vicinity of Rose Camp, he discovered a group of Communist cavalry 300 meters away, almost capturing the lonely car he was riding in. However, after Su Jinin arrived in Zhangjiakou, he took the old and weak employees of the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan and a large number of expert technicians from Beiping and raced from Zhangjiakou and Xibozi to Xiahuayuan, surpassing the reputation of the champions of the two stations meeting in Shacheng, compensating for the horror he suffered on the Jining Zhangyuan Road. Now Su Jinin has returned to Gui Sui and is scheduled to go to the east of Datong to rush to repair. He guarantees that the track can be connected by the end of this month. Our beacon of the transportation industry will once again radiate brilliant brilliance to the Ping-Sui Railway line, which is full of haze.</p>
<p>Director Su Jinin is 52 years old this year. This little old man has the body of a farmer and the demeanor of a soldier. He loves to wear workers' clothes, always has a cigarette in his mouth, and always carries a pistol on his waist. He is unkempt and does not pay attention to eating and drinking, and he has a spirit of adventure and a sense of justice. He is very friendly to promising young people. When he goes to the theater in his spare time, he sits with the young people, applauding and cheering. He also helps students and cultural figures and is loved by young people. He is very straightforward with people and points out what is wrong at the time, without considering face or courtesy. His wife, Ms. Tian Yuce, is the daughter of Tian Zixuan, a famous person in Shanxi, and is now leading women's work in Suiyuan. His only son, Su Tingyan, went to Fang before the war and was later admitted to the Aviation Juvenile School and is currently studying at the Aviation University. Because he has been engaged in the war of resistance and eliminating obstacles to national construction, the father and son have not seen each other for ten years. Therefore, he cherishes the students of Rotary Elementary School as if they were his own children.</p>
<h3>Liaodong Peninsula in the Freezing Wind and Cold Snow</h3>
<p>— News from Xiuyan, 4th Day by Airmail, Our Special Correspondent, Guan Rongqin</p>
<p>The people of the Liaodong Peninsula are praising this year's "winter" for coming especially late, and are enjoying the taste of "little spring" weather, when clouds suddenly descended from the sky like flocks of white birds. The uneven wilderness and the large and small towns and villages are covered with a plain white coat: the peaks that stood far away alone before are now leaning against each other at the same time and running to the front of the people; like human beings, they can't resist the suffering and freezing of several winters, and they are all huddled together, as if to get some warmth from each other.</p>
<p>The compatriots living on the peninsula, like the Northeast compatriots in other places, have also slowly endured the hardships imposed on them by the enemy and puppets for more than ten years. In the two or three years after the "September 18th Incident," they also heard terms such as volunteer army and guerrilla team; some of them even reluctantly joined the volunteer army and fought guerrillas. However, "time" has diluted their memories, and this winter, unexpectedly, new things have appeared that revive their memories.</p>
<p>"Big brother, more than 2,000 of our comrades are coming to your village today, please prepare some food for us!"</p>
<p>"Fellow villagers, more than 5,000 of our comrades will pass through your place tomorrow on their way east. We are all Chinese, please prepare some charcoal and tea for us! At the very least, don't leak the news!"</p>
<p>This kind of sudden news made the villagers, whose brains were squeezed by the cold wind and white snow and were not very active, shudder and wander around like homeless ghosts. Those who were brave and strong-willed braved the wind and snow to report to neighboring villages or towns where the National Army was stationed. For the first one or two times, some National Army or local security teams rushed out, but they all came back empty-handed. Then people heard the news that a certain village had caught two representatives who had asked for charcoal and food.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I don't care if he has thousands or tens of thousands!" The people whose brains were not very active in the first place became bold!</p>
<p>More than a month ago, I went to Xiuyan. I heard that a certain Eighth Route Army staff officer had surrendered to General Long Tianwu's headquarters.</p>
<p>They said that the staff officer was "ordered to fight guerrillas in the Liaoyang-Haicheng area and was not allowed to come out." I had not seen him because he had been sent to Shenyang a few days before I arrived in Xiuyan.</p>
<p>In the past month, I have seen several batches of Eighth Route Army soldiers who have surrendered or been captured. They were prepared to be transferred to Shenyang. Once, I saw more than 40 people in a dilapidated temple. Some were wearing cotton clothes, and some were only wearing lined clothes, huddling their hands and gritting their teeth, shivering in the cold wind. According to a short political worker, he (she) said that they were all relatively important, so they were sent first, and there were several hundred more to be sent in a few days. Many National Army brothers also came to "watch the fun." They looked at him, and he looked at you, but they couldn't see any hostility: this reminded me of my childhood: at that time, in the countryside, I often played "soldiers and thieves" games with wild children of my own age; I had captured "prisoners," and I had also been captured and became a "prisoner." Could it be that the more than 40 compatriots in front of me are more serious than the "prisoners" I used to be? Among the more than 40 prisoners, there were five women. The oldest one was about thirty-five or six years old; and with her as a prisoner was her one-year-old child. The short political worker told me: her husband was the head of the education section of the Eighth Route Army county government. Among the five female prisoners, she invisibly became a representative! First, she was older; second, she was wearing a yellow cotton military uniform and a military cap, while the other four were wearing civilian clothes; third, her eyes were always shooting at everyone who came to "watch the fun," showing a "must-answer" look. I started chatting with her. She was from Hebei, and her husband was from Liaoyang. He went to Hebei to teach, and they got married in Hebei. She said, "During the War of Resistance, there were only Eighth Route Army soldiers in our hometown. If there had been Central Army soldiers, we would have joined the Central Army long ago." The other four women who were captured with her were all from Shandong, only had elementary school education, and were forcibly conscripted by the Eighth Route Army. They said, "We can't not go." The other one was from Zhuanghe, a junior high school student of seventeen or eighteen years old. Strangely, among the more than 40 prisoners, there were three Japanese. Two men and one woman. It is said that the two men were technicians and the woman was one of their wives. The men didn't care, but the woman sat slumped on her bedding. I heard that she cried for a while later: because dinner was delayed. I also heard that among the prisoners who had not yet been transported, there were many Japanese light and heavy machine gun shooters. Is this group of Japanese prisoners for the second or third time?</p>
<p>In General Xu Ying's command post, I saw three Eighth Route Army cadres who had surrendered. One was Ge Gui, the political instructor of the first battalion of the second regiment of the Independent Division, a native of Hebei, in his thirties, who joined the CCP in Yan'an seven or eight years ago; one was Wang Youren, the deputy political instructor of the first battalion, a native of Shandong, who joined the Eighth Route Army only two years ago; and the other was Wang Chunhua, a special agent leader of the third company of the first battalion. Among the three, Ge Gui was more calm and didn't talk much. The most excited was Wang Youren, the Shandong native. All three of them surrendered near Junzi in southwestern Xiuyan, and with them, there were more than 40 Eighth Route Army brothers who surrendered.</p>
<p>"When the people in our battalion saw the National Army, they scattered, slipped away, and surrendered. 'Fellow villagers, we are all Chinese, don't shoot, we are all Chinese, we surrender!' They put down their guns and raised their hands, a total of more than 40 people," Wang Youren's words were full of laughter, scolding, and inexplicable sadness. He also said:</p>
<p>"We fought for several years during the War of Resistance, and we won. Originally, we could have gone home. Damn it, they dragged us to fight again! ... We go here today and there tomorrow, marching in the mountains late at night, stepping on that thick snow... All day long, we don't know when we will have something to eat, maybe one meal or half a meal... We are all Chinese!"</p>
<p>Who says we are not "our own people"? In a bathhouse used as a transit station for the wounded, the trustee saw more than 20 wounded National Army and Eighth Route Army brothers: gray cotton clothes, yellow cotton clothes, sitting shoulder to shoulder, lying foot to foot, they were all wounded in the Shuimenzimiao battle in Fuxian. A National Army brother with a bandage on his head told me: "The battle at Shuimenzimiao was really fierce. The light machine guns and small mortars were fired without aiming!" Among the wounded Eighth Route Army brothers, there were two who were only eighteen or nineteen years old: one was Song Yingjie, a native of Baoshan, Yunnan, who was wounded in the head, wore a bandage, couldn't turn his head flexibly, and didn't like to talk. The other was Liu Wanyou, a native of Liaozhong, who was wounded in the arm. Perhaps because his injury was not serious, he talked freely about his story.</p>
<p>"When we saw the National Army, Song Yingjie and I turned the light machine gun around and shot at our company commander. He also shot at us with his pistol, but he died, and we were only slightly injured!"</p>
<p>"Damn it! Eighth Route Army! Dead end! Running south, there are big noses, running west, there is the sea, running east and north, there are all Central Army soldiers, isn't that a dead end!" As soon as Shi Wanyou finished speaking, a commotion arose among the gray cotton clothes and yellow cotton clothes sitting next to him and lying opposite him.</p>
<p>According to National Army officers who returned from the front lines, in order to prevent surrendering on the battlefield, the Eighth Route Army often used column attacks to advance and did not dare to disperse, because once they dispersed, surrenders would occur one after another. Advancing in dense columns may reduce surrenders, but when they are killed or injured, they are in piles and piles, how cruel! Comforting the National Army, comforting the wounded soldiers, is often seen in Xiuyan, Fengcheng, Zhuanghe, Piziwo, and Pulandian... The place is so poor, and prices are so high. Looking at the three, five, ten, and hundreds of yuan bills that he (she) moved out for comfort, it is better to say that it is "tears" than "money"! When I saw the letters from the primary and middle school students in Fengcheng comforting the National Army, countless small faces with tears in their eyes floated before my eyes!</p>
<p>The Japanese ruled the Northeast for fourteen years, so that the Northeast compatriots, in literature and even language, were indeed dyed with a bit of "Concord" color, but if they wanted to squeeze the concept of the motherland out of the minds of the Northeast compatriots, not only would fourteen years not be enough, even forty or fifty years would not be enough. Chengzitun is a small town at the northeastern end of "Kwantung State." The compatriots in the town saw Japanese troops landing from Woshiwo in the southwest of the town and heading north to fight the imperial Russian army during the Russo-Japanese War. After the Russo-Japanese War, they actually lived under Japanese rule. When the National Army (General Long Tianwu's Chen Ying Department) entered the town this time, the elders in the town were so excited that they went crazy. They pulled their brothers and cried and laughed, saying that they had not seen the National Army for fifty years! The brothers were also moved to tears!</p>
<p>In the areas recovered by the National Army, the common people have opened their storefronts to do business, but because everyone has more "Eighth Route Army tickets" that have become waste paper than goods around them, everyone is poor. The price of grain has risen by several yuan per catty, so they sit together and sigh. After sighing, there is always the sentence "When will this war end?"</p>
<p>The primary and middle schools in several counties here have resumed classes one after another after the Eighth Route Army left; however, the school equipment is "empty." The usual phenomenon is: there is not a single reference book, and the textbooks are not delivered until the end of the semester, and there are still some missing. Xiuyan Boys' Middle School can't even get enough chairs and desks, and two classes of students are still standing to attend classes. The principal's office of Xiuyan Girls' Middle School, which was used as an Eighth Route Army wounded soldier's hospital, is more dilapidated than the army's front-line command post. The school resumed classes in October, but the funding issued by the provincial government is calculated from November: the funding is so small that, in addition to buying chalk, there is not enough firewood left to buy for heating, let alone add any equipment? What physics and chemistry lab, library, except for the small plaques hanging at the door, this small piece of wood cannot be found. There is only one handyman in the whole school. When the handyman is sick, the teacher rings the bell to start and end classes. There is not enough funding, and there is not enough firewood. The only way is to start the holiday early. Once New Year's Day is encountered, there will be a big exam. Once there is an exam, everyone will go home. I heard that the military will perform a play in a few days to raise funds for the school. I don't know how much money can be raised?</p>
<p>Taking Xiuyan as the center, whether it is to the sea, Fengcheng, Andong, Zhuanghe, or Gushan Street, there are highways that can be reached. More than a month ago, sitting in a car would make you vomit, just like the destruction of the highways before the Eighth Route Army retreated. The road was cut every three or four feet; after the villagers repeatedly filled it in, it has been much better in the past month. Charcoal-burning commercial vehicles have occasionally appeared; however, the fare is so expensive, and sitting in the car has to be exposed to the wind, so no one wants to climb up unless it is necessary. The train from Fengcheng to Andong is open; however, it is the same as the commercial vehicles on the highway: it burns charcoal; it stops every three steps, and some people would rather take a board car or even walk, saving trouble. Piziwo in southwestern Zhuanghe and Pulandian in Fuxian have been recovered by the National Army. The people on the peninsula, especially the 200,000 Dalian compatriots who fled to Shenyang, are all nostalgic for Dalian - the "Japanized" water capital!</p>
<p>The New Year is coming, and the compatriots on the peninsula do not seem to have any "new" plans. It is the innocent children who are still in groups pushing snowplows and skating on the frozen riverbanks. They seem to be the only living creatures on this white and red peninsula?</p>
<h3>Construction of the East Liao River</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao, Shenyang, 4th Telegram</p>
<p>The Liao River is the Yellow River of the Northeast. It lacks the benefit of boat transportation and irrigation but suffers from frequent flooding and siltation. The enemy and puppets spent a long time, investing a large amount of capital and manpower, determined to turn the disaster into a benefit. A lot of engineering has already been done. Of course, eighty to ninety percent of this is the crystallization of our compatriots' blood and sweat?</p>
<p>These projects are valuable and worthy of attention. This report covers a large-scale engineering project that was among the first to resume work after the recovery, thanks to everyone's cooperation. That is the East Liao River water conservancy project, a tributary of the Liao River.</p>
<p>The East Liao River—one of the tributaries of the Liao River—originates in the continuous mountain range within the jurisdiction of Xi'an County, in the Saha Ridge. It flows meanderingly southeast until it crosses the Chinese Changchun Railway and enters the fertile Taiping Plain. This is indeed a place of "intersecting fields" and "verdant green," suitable for farming. According to the "Outline of Northeast Water Conservancy," the river's total length is 333.5 kilometers, with a drainage area of 10,180 square kilometers. It flows through Xi'an, Huai'de, and Lishu counties and enters the Liao River at Kuyushu.</p>
<p>Japanese Management During the Puppet Regime</p>
<p>In order to increase production for immigration and strengthen their capital for aggression, the Japanese considered the "East Liao River Flood Control and Irrigation Project" as one of the emergency projects. Their planned project included three major components: dam construction, water storage, diversion, irrigation, afforestation, wind protection, and sand control. Their expected goal was to reclaim 600,000 mu of paddy and dry land, increase the production of rice and miscellaneous grains by more than 86,000 tons, and reduce the flood volume of the East Liao River from 2,700 cubic meters per second to 510 cubic meters per second, thus eliminating flood disasters. At the same time, it would solve the problem of low-water navigation downstream and industrial water use in Siping City.</p>
<p>In order to realize this plan, the puppet "Manchuria Colonization Corporation" began constructing a large dam across the East Liao River at Didazuizi, east of Siping Street, at the end of 1943. The original plan for the dam was to have a height of 26.8 meters and a length of 560 meters, of which 100 meters would be a steel-reinforced concrete spillway with a height of 18 meters to discharge floodwaters. By August 15th, before the recovery, only 80 percent had been completed. It is said that at that time, in order to meet military needs and save time, the Japanese did everything possible to complete a five-year project in two years, forcing our country's farmers to serve, organizing so-called "diligent service teams" and "patriotic diligent service teams," working day and night regardless of the cold and heat.</p>
<p>Launch of Reconstruction Work</p>
<p>The Northeast Regional Office of the Water Conservancy Commission, considering that the most important part of the project, the earth dam, had been partially completed by the enemy and puppets, but its height was still below the flood level and its thickness was insufficient. If a summer flood or autumn flood were to suddenly arrive, not only would this project be likely to be destroyed, but the downstream area affected by the disaster would reach 2.28 million mu. Therefore, it negotiated with the Northeast Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Liaobei Provincial Government to establish an "East Liao River Engineering Committee" to be responsible for promoting, guiding, and supervising the resumption of the project. At the same time, the Water Conservancy Special Envoy Office established the East Liao River Engineering Bureau to be responsible for the implementation of the project.</p>
<p>The Engineering Bureau was officially established at the Didazuizi construction site on August 1st. At that time, the principles of construction were determined: major projects would be contracted out to merchants, while scattered projects would be handled by self-established construction teams. After the establishment of the East Liao River Engineering Bureau, it immediately began various preparatory works, clearing and sorting out the construction site, organizing residual materials, repairing tools and equipment, purchasing equipment, repairing houses, gunpowder depots, power rooms, machine shops, and repairing roads. At the same time, it handled commercial recruitment in Shenyang. By the end of August, most of the above work had come to an end. After deliberation by relevant parties, the contracting part was undertaken by Zhongxin, Lihua, and Jiancheng Construction Companies, with a total contract price of 57,717,775.00 Northeast circulation coupons.</p>
<p>Progress of Major Projects</p>
<p>The main parts of this project include eight items: dam body filling, quarrying stone blocks, rubble revetment, rubble retaining wall, concrete revetment, concrete bridge deck, concrete pier, and turf revetment. Among them, dam body filling and quarrying stone blocks started first in early September. Rubble revetment, concrete, spillway, and pier projects were then implemented accordingly.</p>
<p>The concrete pier started in late September. As of early November, the progress was still smooth. The rubble revetment project only started in mid-October due to the relationship between the dam body filling and the blasting stone. As of the beginning of December, only 3,420 cubic meters had been completed. Currently, they are working day and night, hoping to complete it in January 1947.</p>
<p>Going from Siping to the construction site, north of the Shiling Station, you can see piles of buckets, axles, and remnants of machinery. After another thirty li, the large dam stands majestically on the East Ban River. The green artificial lake also has a preliminary form. It is said that the Japanese had specially established machine tool repair shops, lumber mills, and pneumatic factories for the East Liao River project, as well as drilling machines, mountain-opening machines, excavators, and crushers. Unfortunately, due to the destruction after August 15th, there are only two radio-style iron tower cranes on the dam top, and six tank-style compactors are roaring. The rest of the water pumps, cement mixers, mountain-opening machines, and various types of machinery are rumbling. One hundred and sixty transport vehicles on the seven rails on the dam top are constantly transporting earth and stones.</p>
<p>At the end of 1946, the reservoir project was mostly completed. As for the irrigation area, it is still far west of the Chinese Changchun Railway, more than sixty kilometers away from Didazuizi. Its range stretches from Xiaochengzi, Laosonglinzi, Ergushan, and Gujiazi in the south to the south bank of the Liao River in the north. This new agricultural area was previously sparsely populated and very desolate. Although it has not yet been completed, there are already crisscrossing canals. Once the auxiliary works of the canal, such as water diversion and water-saving gate dams, aqueducts, drops, and highway bridges, are completed, water can be diverted for irrigation. This project has not yet started due to insufficient material preparation and local instability. It is expected to start in April next year and can be completed before the ground freezes in July. This is a great project, and it is also not to be ignored for the national economy and the people's livelihood!</p>

<h3>American Domestic and Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>Sufficient to Determine the Future Destiny of the World</p>
<p>Post-war America has become the core of world problems. The domestic and foreign policies that President Truman should adopt in the future are sufficient to determine the future destiny of the world. Therefore, people all over the world have focused their attention on President Truman's message to Congress on the 6th. In this lengthy message, the domestic and foreign policies that the United States should adopt in the future were explained in detail. Although President Truman's policies are not as rich in far-reaching and lofty ideals as those adopted by the late President Roosevelt, they are still practical and moderate. Under the current circumstances, Truman can only take this approach to gain the unanimous support of the Democratic and Republican parties.</p>
<p>Cooperation Between the Two Parties Stabilizes the Political Situation</p>
<p>The Republican Party expressed satisfaction with Truman's message, except for some opinions on domestic affairs. As Senate Speaker Vandenberg said: "President Truman's message is mild and tactful, and is unanimously approved by Republican senators. The president's arguments on the relationship between the White House and Congress are also reasonable." At the same time, Republican Congressman Halleck also said: "The Republican Party is also willing to cooperate with President Truman to achieve a fair resolution of American problems. I believe that the Republican and Democratic parties will be able to work together in the House of Representatives." From this, it can be seen that President Truman's message to Congress has received a good response in the United States, and there is no problem with cooperation between the two parties. From this, it can also be predicted that President Truman will not have disagreements with Congress before the expiration of his term and cause political turmoil. Therefore, President Truman's message to Congress finally brought temporary stability to the American political situation.</p>
<p>Marshal Returns Home, Appointed Secretary of State</p>
<p>Marshal's departure from China and return home is already noteworthy news. When he boarded the special plane in China, the news that Secretary of State Byrnes had resigned and been succeeded by Marshal also reached China. This is indeed the first important news of 1947, shaking the world.</p>
<p>The US Senate unanimously approved President Truman's appointment of Marshal as Secretary of State on the 8th, without any dissent. This is a rare phenomenon in American political history. Time magazine praised Byrnes as a great man of 1946. We can really say that Marshal is a truly great figure in modern American history. Marshal was ordered to come to China to mediate the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for eleven months. He not only contacted all parties, but also silently observed the evolution of the situation in China and the Far East, so he deeply knew the political situation in China and understood the core of the situation in the Far East! Therefore, we predict that after Marshal returns home and takes office, the focus of American foreign policy will be concentrated in the Far East. Marshal will rely on his superhuman wisdom and his undefeated strategy. With his diplomatic skills, he will make greater contributions to the peaceful resolution of the Chinese problem. At the same time, he will also try to improve US-Soviet relations, restore the spirit of mutual trust and mutual assistance during the war, and work together to create peace, at least to make the international situation in 1947 unfold a beautiful prospect.</p>
<h3>Leprosy Treated with Sulfa Drugs</h3>
<p>The US Public Health Service's Leprosy Advisory Committee recently published a plan to eradicate leprosy, hoping to use powerful new "Sulfa" drugs to cure 3 million leprosy patients worldwide, reducing one of humanity's greatest enemies. The committee specifically pointed out that leprosy can be effectively treated, and even completely cured, but it must be diagnosed early and the latest treatment methods must be applied. The committee hopes to completely eliminate the leprosy epidemic in the United States in the next few years, and hopes to quickly and universally contain leprosy around the world with new diagnostic and treatment methods.</p>
<h3>Japan has become a Battlefield of Ideological Warfare</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xu Hong from Reader's Digest</p>
<p>Japan in the second year of Allied occupation has become a battlefield of ideological warfare. Challenging the United States is the Soviet Union. The outcome of this battle will determine whether Japan is "a strong fortress of peace, or a dangerous springboard for war" (MacArthur's words).</p>
<p>The outcome of this battle is decided only by the Japanese themselves; some observers believe that this nascent democracy is no match for red pressure, while other Americans familiar with Japan believe that although the foundation of Japanese democracy has only recently been planted, it is strong and planted on very fertile ground.</p>
<p>Now, the battle that has turned postwar Europe into terror is also fiercely attacking Japan. Japan is now being torn apart by two opposing forces, both of which confusingly allow the people freedom.</p>
<p>After the surrender, the release of political prisoners restored the activities of communists. A team came from the Chinese communist area. As a result, the Communist Party took control of the burgeoning Japanese labor movement, radio broadcasting, and publishing.</p>
<p>In January 1946, most of the widely circulated newspapers in Tokyo and Osaka and the smaller provincial newspapers were clearly leaning to the left. Those newspapers that did not openly admit to belonging to the Communist Party loudly supported the Communist Party's arguments. In Tokyo, the employees of three major newspapers drove away the bosses and editors - and seized the management rights of the editors. Before the government ordered a ban, this method replaced the usual weapon of workers: strikes.</p>
<p>At first, the Supreme Command seemed unwilling to intervene and in fact, there were still a few of the command's workers who went around and secretly encouraged Japan's left-wing elements, but when these were noticed by MacArthur, newspaper rations were handed over to trusted personnel, and some Americans were also "sent back."</p>
<h3>Pressure Comes from Moscow</h3>
<p>Today, the Japanese people are living under tremendous pressure from the left. There is no way to conceal the fact that the source of this pressure comes from Smoko. This pressure is implemented in two layers: openly in the Allied Advisory Council in Tokyo; hiddenly in public opinion, which is used to confuse and agitate the Japanese masses.</p>
<p>At the upper level, a suitable but bloated diplomatic corps, led by Brigadier General Kuzma Derevyanko, represents the Soviet Union. It includes more than 500 people. (The British delegation has only thirty-two members.) The Soviet Union has no active task in the occupation work. Derevyanko's task is to bring out criticisms of MacArthur's policies (all domestic) at bi-weekly meetings - these are cleverly avoided by MacArthur's representative, Acheson.</p>
<p>In the next stage, the Soviet Union's strategy is roughly effective. The Soviet Union's Warm Wave Radio Station in Siberia broadcasts strong anti-MacArthur, anti-government rhetoric to Japan every day. Although there are less than five hundred shortwave radios in Japan, its existence sends this propaganda into the hearts of the Japanese people, and any special broadcast can be found in the Japanese newspapers in 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>Many Japanese wonder why the United States does not stop these activities. The answer is: In a democracy, even opinions that are extremely contrary to reality have the right to speak out, criticize, and discuss, and even distort facts. This only allows everyone to distinguish between right and wrong themselves. Now the Japanese have begun to see through Soviet-style democracy.</p>
<h3>To the Moon</h3>
<p>— Translated from Magazine Digest</p>
<p>"Lunar travel" is about to become a reality. Now mankind has begun to make practical preparations for the unprecedented first journey to the outside world. The organizers this time are not pseudoscientists who like to show off, but the down-to-earth US Army.</p>
<p>This year, the US Army has "reached" the moon through the medium of radar waves. Next year, an unmanned rocket, loaded with radio automatic reporting instruments, will attempt a one-way flight of 240,000 miles. After that, as soon as science solves a few more difficult problems, humans will be able to actually try "lunar travel." Major Carl Hahne, director of the US Air Force Rocket Group, recently told a United Press reporter in Washington that he hopes to make a round trip to the moon in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Regarding the preparation and purpose of "lunar travel," scientific paper writers have had detailed discussions in famous magazines.</p>
<p>Because there is no water, air, or food on the moon, and there is no climate like on Earth, lunar explorers must wear specially made suits weighing seven hundred pounds, containing all the necessities of life. However, due to the smaller mass and gravity of the moon, these suits weighing seven hundred pounds on Earth weigh only one hundred and forty pounds on the moon, and at the same time, the explorer inside the suit, weighing one hundred and eighty pounds, weighs only thirty-five pounds on the moon.</p>
<p>If humans want to fly out of the Earth, they must invent a super-high-speed rocket with a speed of seven miles per second, which is enough to overcome the Earth's gravity. The efficiency of the motor used only needs to be twice that of the existing motor. There are two purposes for mankind to conquer the moon: one is a far-reaching purpose, that is, in case of a "cosmic war" and a war between humans on Earth and humans on Mars or Venus, the moon can be used as an outpost of the Earth. The second purpose is immediate, that is, scientific exploration, such as discovering extraterrestrial and other unknown valuable substances on the moon.</p>
<p>"What will we find on the moon?" To know the answer, please read the following. This is a two-week broadcast report sent to Earth on the first day (equivalent to half a month on Earth) by the first human lunar expedition team after arriving on the moon. Part of the content is based on various famous astronomical works.</p>
<h3>July 1st Temperature - Over Two Hundred Degrees Below Zero</h3>
<p>Dear listeners! I am Major Smith, rocket pilot XR701 of the US Air Force, broadcasting from the moon! That's right, we arrived here safely an hour ago, but as for the situation on the moon, what we know at this moment is no different from what you know on Earth: we only know two facts now: it's very dark and very cold here. After two weeks of continuous night, the temperature drops to minus two hundred and forty-two degrees. We are saved from freezing to death by specially made insulated clothing.</p>
<p>While we are waiting for dawn, let us report our broadcast program. The scientists in our expedition team, such as Professor Gray, physicist and radiation expert, Dr. Dunn, biologist and bacteriologist, and Jackson, geologist and mineralogist, will make reports on their findings. I will make a general broadcast of our experiences and discoveries day by day. All materials will be provided by the scientists.</p>
<p>Since you millions of people watched us depart from the Arizona desert, a wisp of flame shooting into the sky, the situation is probably like this:</p>
<p>We have been rising, and the speed is getting higher and higher, until the electronic speed indicator shows a speed of seven miles per second, I turned off the motor, and then we "reached the shore." Now there is no danger of falling. There is no place to fall here. We have broken away from the Earth's gravity and are hanging alone in the vacuum of space.</p>
<p>After advancing a few thousand miles, it began to rain, at least the sound of dripping on the rocket's outer shell was like rain. I talked about this on the communicator, only to see Dawson smile. He said, "No, there will be no rain, hail, or sleet where we are now, and there will be no wind..."</p>
<p>I thought to myself, "Tennyson sitting in a spaceship"!</p>
<p>Dawson said, "It is stardust, cosmic particles floating around the solar system. We must pass through this cloud of particles."</p>
<p>"I hope we don't encounter particles as big as Rhode Island," said Rocket Technician and Co-Pilot Lyon seriously, followed by a quiet silence.</p>
<h3>Touching the Surface of the Moon</h3>
<p>The sky is pitch black, dotted with stars like wide-open and unblinking eyes. There is no moon.</p>
<p>No moon... We are speeding towards infinite space, towards an invisible target. This is in accordance with the original plan. We must arrive on the moon before the dawn of the three hundred and thirty-six hours of the lunar day, so that we can make full use of the daylight to engage in our exploration work. In the next hundred hours, we had nothing to do in the rocket except watch the countless instruments, cherish all kinds of hopes, and play cards.</p>
<p>But in the last two hours, I sat in the pilot's seat, my eyes fixed on the instruments. The rest of the team stood in their respective positions, their emotions extremely tense. ... We were not very sure how the lunar surface would react to our altimeter. When the instrument indicated a thousand miles, at our speed, we only had a little more than two minutes left, and I began to use reverse rockets to "brake."</p>
<p>Within ten seconds, the instrument indicated that we were moving away from the moon. I was sweating profusely and at a loss. I saw Lyon smile coldly and say, "The moon's gravity is only one-sixth of the Earth's." Under the tense emotions, I forgot this point and had an Earthling's reaction.</p>
<p>I relaxed the reverse rocket controller, and we slowly descended. Seven hundred miles... six hundred, five hundred... one hundred miles. I held my breath and prayed silently. After passing through the vast and boundless space, our rocket finally slowly touched the surface of the moon.</p>
<p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. We helped each other put on those seven hundred pounds of heavy "moon suits," carefully stepped out of the rocket, and waited for dawn. This was ten minutes ago. After we passed through the rocket's double vacuum door, we felt much more relaxed. We can move freely, but we dare not. We don't know if we are standing on the edge of a valley or at the bottom of a five-mile-deep volcanic crater.</p>
<p>It is pitch black all around. We can't see anything and we can't hear anything. We are curled up next to the rocket, and dawn will come in only thirty minutes. (To be continued in the next issue)</p>

<h3>Left to the Next Generation</h3>
<p>— Yecao</p>
<p>After Viewing the Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Documents</p>
<p>Living expenses for the families of traitors have already begun to be returned, and impressions of corruption in the takeover are still scattered in people's minds. At present, we cannot but force ourselves to acknowledge these realities that have already become facts.</p>
<p>But this kind of recognition is painful enough. Especially after we have seen the Exhibition of Anti-Japanese War Documents with our own eyes.</p>
<p>The eight years of the Anti-Japanese War have left behind so many moving documents. This glory belongs to countless heroes who sacrificed themselves for the country before and behind enemy lines. The martyred heroes left this glory to us, but we have lightly forgotten it; those comrades who survived behind enemy lines are also full of scars, carrying physical disabilities in exchange for their lives. These disabilities once exchanged for the health of the nation, but haven't we all forgotten them again in the turbulent reality?</p>
<p>We were greatly moved by this Anti-Japanese War Documents Exhibition organized by the Society for the Relief of Martyrs. Everyone who stepped into the Municipal Museum relived the faces of the heroes who suffered lifelong hardships to liberate ourselves.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Menglin's only scrotum, and Mr. Liu Zhigang's deformed body after being injected with poison, fully illustrate the undisguised bestiality of the invaders, and also illustrate the price we paid to fight for justice. Although Mr. Jiang and Mr. Liu have lost their personal health, they are still able to live with us on this free land. This is the highest honor of our generation.</p>
<p>Ms. Fan Yunfang and her business - the Xianle Photo Studio, have also left an indelible page for underground work. This page will forever illuminate the bottom layer of this muddled city, making thousands of urban daughters who sing and drink yearn for this noble example!</p>
<p>Martyr Ping Zuren finally left us. What a magnificent rest! Victory is painted with blood like this. Facing his quietly lying remains in the photo, we should have a deep realization!</p>
<p>Bless these heroes who have suffered hardships and torments! We will leave this brilliant memory to the next generation!</p>
<h3>The Story of Collapse</h3>
<p>— Shu Xun</p>
<p>I returned home today, and my wife's face didn't look good. I panicked: Had she found out about my dancing at the tea house this afternoon? My own face couldn't help but tense up, but I had to relax my facial muscles and gently probe:</p>
<p>"Why are you unhappy? Is Xiao Manli being disobedient? Then it must be that Da Guan isn't studying diligently." I was a little annoyed. My wife was too doting on the children, and the children were too naughty and outrageous.</p>
<p>My wife just shook her head, and her eyes were a little moist.</p>
<p>It must be Da Guan making Mom angry, because he's the only one who often makes Mom cry with anger.</p>
<p>"Da Guan, come here!"</p>
<p>I wanted to play the role of a temporary judge again.</p>
<p>"No, no, don't scold him, I'm just sad."</p>
<p>I panicked even more. In these times, getting sick is no joke. Consultation fees, medicine fees, surgery fees—it all adds up to millions. My God! But I had to be extremely careful and concerned:</p>
<p>"Do you need a doctor? Dr. Wang is my childhood classmate, and Dr. Zhao is a consultant at my company. I'll call them. Dear, where exactly are you feeling unwell?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to you, Third Brother has collapsed, and he's disappeared!" My wife finally burst into tears.</p>
<p>I understood. She didn't know about the tea house dancing, and a weight lifted from my heart.</p>
<p>But, Third Brother has collapsed! I thought of how capable my wife usually is, able to lend a million to others and collect two hundred thousand in interest each month to supplement the household income. She often went out shopping.</p>
<p>"Look, I bought a piece of clothing material, one hundred thousand and five thousand, is it cheap? Is it pretty? This is the money I earned." Whenever this happened, I always praised her for being capable. And only in these situations would she be as happy as a little bird, her smile as radiant as blossoming flowers—not even as beautiful as she was during our honeymoon. At the same time, she was also very proud, as if saying that I wasn't as capable as she was. Under my humble admiration, she became even more pleased and triumphant, seemingly even more so than when she stepped into the wedding hall during our wedding…</p>
<p>But today, she collapsed. Like a phoenix, suddenly having its beautiful tail cut off, or like a flower, withering in an instant.</p>
<p>I really didn't expect Third Brother to collapse! He usually saved every penny, was steady and reliable in his work, and never told a lie."</p>
<p>My wife sobbed as she explained to me.</p>
<p>"Someone wanted to arrest him to report to the authorities. But Big Brother couldn't bear it and ordered an audit to be conducted. It turns out that he lost five million in business last March. To save face and maintain his credit, he started borrowing money to get by, moving funds from one place to another to cover debts, with interest rates getting higher and the debt amount increasing. To borrow money, he also had to engage in more socialising. To socialize, the events became bigger and more lavish, increasing expenses and loosening his grip on money. He also generously provided for the household. No wonder Third Brother's wife bought a leather coat last month, and Xiao Baoshi is covered in gold jewellery. It turns out they were all spending other people's money!"</p>
<p>"How much did he lose?"</p>
<p>"In the end, he owes a total of eighty-seven million."</p>
<p>"Your share?"</p>
<p>"My five million is all gone!"</p>
<p>My wife cried very sadly.</p>
<p>I felt like the sky was spinning and the earth was turning. Five million, five million, five million…</p>
<h3>"Opinion Meter"</h3>
<p>— Jia Yuan</p>
<p>Holding a vote in a huge venue is indeed an extremely troublesome matter. With so many people and hands involved, it's easy to make mistakes in the calculations. Even a slight oversight can require starting over, wasting a lot of time, and also negatively impacting the order of the venue. Another point is that while a person can absolutely agree or absolutely disagree with a question, sometimes they may only partially agree. For example, 75% agree, 25% disagree. But in a normal venue, it is impossible to accurately calculate this. This has to be considered a major flaw.</p>
<p>But humans are ultimately intelligent animals and have finally invented a tool that can precisely calculate opinions. This thing is called the "Opinion Meter." It was designed by General Electric of the United States and can record all kinds of opinions, from "1% agree" to "99% agree." As for absolute agreement or absolute disagreement, that's even less of a problem. This machine can record up to 150 different opinions. Each opinion takes an average of ten seconds to record. Finally, turning the mechanism, the pointer can tell you the accurate percentage, such as 53% agree. Its precision is beyond what can be achieved by hand calculation. In the 20th century, which has a particularly large number of meetings, it is indeed extremely useful. (The above is based on a United Press report from New York.)</p>
<h3>Stability First</h3>
<p>— Wan Shi</p>
<p>Talking About New Tricks in Labor-Management Disputes</p>
<p>Since the victory, especially in Shanghai, labor-management disputes have arisen one after another, endlessly. At that time, the weapons of the labor side against the capital side were nothing more than "lazy work," "slow work," and "strike." However, recently, many labor-management disputes have been caused by the year-end bonus issue. The labor side has two new weapons against the capital side, and these two new terms are "worried work" and "slow work."</p>
<p>The originator of "worried work" is the Little Luzon department store on Nanjing Road. Their employees set up a rectangular wooden sign at the entrance, with the words "worried work" written in large letters. Inside the department store, on all the walls and glass counters, they pasted slogans, stating that the Lunar New Year is approaching, prices are expensive, and daily life needs cannot be met with low wages. They demanded that the capital side understand their plight, issue double salaries, increase wages, and promptly issue the public funds due to them. Because the labor side did not want the capital side to suffer losses, they continued to operate as usual, meaning that "worried work" was only a spiritual expression, a new trick and a passive form of resistance.</p>
<p>As for the originator of "slow work" is the French-owned tram company. They also implemented "slow work" as resistance for the year-end bonus issue. The so-called "slow work" means reducing the speed of the tram to that of walking. For example, it takes an hour and a half to go from Shanzhong Road to the Bund's 16th Pier, which can really be said to have created the record for the slowest vehicle speed. The intention was to reduce the capital side's income, which is also a "new trick."</p>
<p>When we see the above situation, we will feel that this is unfortunate for both labor and capital. But why can't labor and capital understand each other? Why can't labor and capital coordinate with each other? Both sides are to blame. Mayor Wu once said last year: "If you want to eat eggs, you must protect the hen." We hope that whether it is the hen or the egg, from now on, they should love each other. Currently in China, in a thousand words, one sentence stands out: "Stability first." We hope that the new terms regarding labor-management disputes will also end here.</p>
<h3>"Opportunity" Passes in an Instant</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>There is an idiom that says "opportunity" will knock on everyone's door once, but only once. Often, the sound of its knocking is not heard, and it becomes a regret. Here are some stories of regret.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to find out who lent money to Robert Fulton and allowed him to invent the steamboat, because the supporter was afraid that his name would be ridiculed for sponsoring this project, so he hid his name. But later, the steamboat was invented, and he was still an unknown person.</p>
<p>When George Westinghouse designed a steam brake in 1875, he sent the plan to Vanderbilt, the key figure in the railway industry, who returned Westinghouse's letter to him and wrote a sentence at the bottom of the letter: "I don't have time to mess around with stupid idiots!" Idiot? Ha, Westinghouse later became one of the leading inventors in the United States!</p>
<p>One day, a stranger walked up to Mark Twain and asked him for five hundred dollars, saying that he was willing to offset half of the benefits of his invention as the price for that money. Mark Twain "bit his lip" and considered it for a long time, then resolutely refused. However, for the sake of politeness, he asked the stranger's name. "Bell," the man replied, turning to leave, "My name is Alexander Graham Bell." Now, everyone knows that he is the inventor of the telephone.</p>
<p>The person who made a suggestion to the author of Sherlock Holmes (Conan Doyle) was also not a stranger. He was a young actor in Conan Doyle's play. He suggested that from now on, the writer's income and his own, no matter how much, should be put together and divided equally until death. Doyle couldn't help but laugh, "If I didn't know you were joking," he said, "Charlie Chaplin, I would have fired you long ago for your presumptuous and audacious suggestion." Now this Charlie Chaplin is the star of "The Great Dictator," a unique comedic film star. Ha, needless to say?</p>

<h3>County Magistrate Today</h3>
<p>— Ruo Si</p>
<p>To be a county magistrate today, unless you are a genius, it is difficult to handle affairs. People, finance, construction, education, military, law, grain, society, land... everything is concentrated in one person. If the county magistrate is a political official, then the section chiefs of each department should be administrative officials, so that they can barely handle matters. However, today's county magistrates mostly bring a team with them. This year they are county magistrates in County A, and these few people jump around. If they don't do well, they are sued by the local people, and they can't sit still. Next year they will be county magistrates in County B, and it is still this team, still these few people jumping around. This is of course one of the miracles of Chinese politics, but now it seems to be commonplace. If the county magistrate does not bring a team and takes office alone, even welcoming him cannot be handled. The superiors will definitely not have a good impression, "Huh, this person doesn't even have cadres." The team does not have great ability.</p>
<p>Some county magistrates have a monthly salary of only ninety thousand yuan (believe it or not), while the secretary and section chief have fifty to sixty thousand yuan. Currently, the salary of a county magistrate in Jiangsu is only more than two hundred thousand yuan, which is stronger than a rickshaw puller in Shanghai. But everything has to be done, local people are quarrelling, the army wants rice, conscription, if you do it seriously, you are busy from morning to night, and twenty-four hours a day is not enough. It can be seen that the county government's office expenses are only a few hundred thousand yuan. Should this amount be used to send telegrams or to eat snacks? Not to mention pens, ink, and paper.</p>
<p>If money is needed, it can only be moved from one place to another. If the county magistrate has a clear conscience, the accounts cannot be checked. The county council has great power in hand. If they put on a serious face to check, the consequences would be unimaginable. The budget and expenses, especially under the special expenses item, must be approved by the council, but the council is not necessarily ideal. If the county magistrate does not deal with them well, it will be quite terrible. It may be impossible to promote anything, and you can only pack up and leave. If you want to implement some facilities, it is not possible to do it boldly, because there are too many constraints. "Dictatorship" is not possible, and "democracy" does not seem to work well either.</p>
<p>A certain county magistrate told me four rules for "county magistrate theory":</p>
<p>Use him like a sage;</p>
<p>Drive him like an ox or horse;</p>
<p>Discard him like worn shoes;</p>
<p>Defend against him like a thief.</p>
<p>This can be a portrayal of today's county magistrate. In fact, there are many people who want to be county magistrates but cannot. Do they have a strong interest in local administration? Not necessarily. Some county magistrates have to rely on special relationships to survive and promise everything. Today, politics is not on track, and there are too many people in positions. When the county magistrate takes office, a large number of resumes of staff members are introduced. Is it true that no one is doing county administration? Not necessarily. The county magistrate's head is flattened, and it depends on each person's means.</p>
<p>If there is an old team and someone promises everything, then the county magistrate will become more and more old, and the work will become easier and easier. Even if he does nothing and closes his eyes, he can handle things well, and it does not necessarily require any talent.</p>
<h3>Various Fire Extinguishers</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Fire, like water, can benefit mankind and also harm mankind. We make use of fire and also worry about fire. Since ancient times, mankind's weapon for extinguishing fire has always been water. Now, although fire trucks have been improved and pumps have been invented, the main weapon for extinguishing fire is still water.</p>
<p>Ordinary fire extinguishing equipment has many shortcomings. It cannot approach objects that are on fire and producing high heat to extinguish them. But how can intelligent humans sit idly by and let the fire god run rampant? Some new fire extinguishing weapons have been invented. Here, I will introduce three to the readers:</p>
<p>The first is colorless, chemically inert carbon dioxide. The gas we exhale when we breathe is it. The old-fashioned carbon dioxide fire extinguisher uses sodium carbonate and sulfuric acid to produce carbon dioxide gas. The new carbon dioxide fire extinguisher directly fills a high-pressure sealed cylinder with liquid carbon dioxide. When used, the lid is opened, and the pressure inside the cylinder disappears. The carbon dioxide then sprays out rapidly, expanding to five hundred times its volume, covering the fire scene like cold frost, with a temperature as low as minus one hundred and ten degrees! The snow-like carbon dioxide immediately turns into a gas, enveloping the fire scene, isolating it from the outside oxygen, making it impossible to continue burning.</p>
<p>Another new fire extinguishing weapon is called "fire-covering foam." "Fire-covering foam" is a sticky, sponge-like foam that sticks to everything, even on vertical glass sheets. Wherever there is a fire, it can extinguish it, just like using a wet straw bag to extinguish embers.</p>
<p>The strange feature of foam fire extinguishing is that it is not a chemical reaction, but a completely mechanical action. The liquid used to make the foam is usually aluminum sulfate or a secret product made from soybeans used to make wine. This "soybean soup" is mixed with water and air, pumped out, and sprayed out through a nozzle, becoming fire-extinguishing foam. "Fire-covering foam" is as harmless as carbon dioxide. It is harmless to clothing and human skin. After the fire is extinguished, 90% of the foam disappears.</p>
<p>Now there is a fire brigade that carries only "fire-covering foam" and a powerful pump, and no other fire extinguishing materials. By mixing one hundred gallons of water, they can make one thousand gallons of foam. The foam is sprayed out, either flowing or evaporating due to the heat, but the foam sticks tightly to the burning object. Therefore, in places where water sources are scarce, "fire-covering foam" is a valuable fire extinguishing weapon. Another fire extinguishing weapon is "water mist," which is not made of any secret chemicals, but is simply mankind's original fire extinguishing weapon - water - broken down into a "mist wall." A water hose, passing through a specially made spray nozzle, will be divided into many needle-shaped jets. These jets collide with each other as they flow from the top of the hose, and are further divided into billions of tiny water droplets. These water droplets, when sprayed out, create a fire-extinguishing "mist wall."</p>
<p>The principle of "water mist" fire extinguishing is very simple: countless water droplets surround the fire scene, absorbing the heat and lowering the temperature, while isolating it from the oxygen in the air, so the fire god is captured.</p>
<p>"Water mist" has many advantages: because this mist wall is non-conductive, when a high-voltage power plant catches fire, firefighters can use "water mist" to approach and rescue without the risk of electric shock. Also, because the water particles are almost weightless, it is especially beneficial for rescuing burning ships. Ship fires are very difficult to extinguish because the ship is loaded with fuel for navigation, and the ship's hull generates high heat when it burns. Although there is no shortage of water sources, the ship is filled with water. Although the fire is extinguished, the ship also capsizes. Last year, the "Normandy" ocean liner caught fire in New York Harbor. The result of using water to extinguish the fire day and night was that it capsized. But if "water mist" is used for rescue, this drawback can be avoided. During the war, the United Nations' large transport ship "Manhattan" caught fire and was out of control. Fortunately, "water mist" was used for emergency rescue. After spraying for three days, the fire was extinguished, and the ship only had a slight list. If seawater had been used for rescue, the "Manhattan" would have been "pulled away" by the Sea Dragon King long ago.</p>

<h3>From *The Grapes of Wrath* to See America</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>The American novel scene of the past decade has been dominated by Hemingway, Saroyan, and Steinbeck. Hemingway's technique is commonplace, merely using novel subject matter to attract readers. As for "For Whom the Bell Tolls," the lived experience is insufficient, and the imagery fails to materialize. It is only appreciated by vulgar petty bourgeois individuals, and cannot be considered literature. Saroyan's vocabulary is too limited to grasp complex characters and grand scenes. Steinbeck, on the other hand, uses his powerful pen to portray the reality of American people's lives. "Of Mice and Men" is a timeless masterpiece, while the artistic and social value of "The Grapes of Wrath" has reached a peak.</p>
<p>Chinese intellectuals tend to have a certain perspective on America, often placing their hopes on the United States as if it were paved with gold bars, gold nuggets, stocks, and bonds, just waiting to be picked up; as if every city and village were holding grand cocktail parties day and night, waiting for you to attend; as if every woman were as glamorous and passionate as described in film advertisements, waiting for you to kiss or embrace. "The Grapes of Wrath" is a good book to correct this tendency.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, the fields of Oklahoma are barren. The wind blows incessantly, and the sky is forever filled with dust and smog. The barren fields are divided into countless irregular patches. Layers of dust cover the land, burying the already scarce and desperately thirsty plants. Farmers, with handkerchiefs wrapped around their heads and wearing sand-proof glasses, diligently cultivate this land, irrigating it with their sweat and blood. However, they cannot enjoy their harvest because, although they reclaimed the land, they borrowed from the bank during lean years, and the ownership of the land has been transferred to the bank. Now, they must pay a sum of rent to the landowners. Moreover, because a tractor can replace the labor of twelve or thirteen farm families, the supply of labor becomes redundant. "The tenant system is no longer viable."</p>
<p>Now, the farmers must leave these desolate fields. Where will they go? How will they live in the future? The bank does not care about these matters. The bank only demands its profits and interest. The landowners of California have distributed many leaflets in the East, saying that they need a lot of labor to pick grapes or do other work, and that the wages are quite favorable. But what is the reality? They only need a small amount of labor, and they deliberately advertise in this way because, according to the law of supply and demand, the more people who come to California seeking work, the lower they can drive down wages, thus gaining more profit.</p>
<p>In the flood of refugees, some carry their entire families, buying a used truck to serve as transportation, loading their families and everyday household items onto the truck, packing it as full as a can of food. In their illusions, California is ideal, the Garden of Eden on earth. The grandfather says: "Over there, it's full of grapes, with clusters of grapes hanging everywhere. Guess what I'm going to do? I'm going to pick a basin full of grapes and sit in the middle of it, letting the juice soak through my pants." The mother says: "But I can't help but think that California is very good, the weather is never cold, there are fruits everywhere, and people live in small white houses hidden among the bushes, a place to one's heart's content."</p>
<p>Death and flight are always close-knit twin brothers. In the Joad family's journey, the first to die is the grandfather. Originally, when it was time to set off, he was reluctant to leave his hometown. They got him drunk with medicinal wine and carried him onto the truck. Forcing an old man to leave the land where he grew up is already enough to cause him spiritual pain, and adding the hardship of the journey, an acute stroke ended his life. Before crossing the desert, the grandmother also died. In order to help everyone escape the arid desert sooner, the mother kept the news of the grandmother's death a secret, sleeping with the grandmother's cold corpse all night. It was not until the truck reached the Great Plains that the news was revealed. Another event that cast a shadow over everyone's hearts was the disappearance of the eldest son, Noah, who went off alone to fight for his life.</p>
<p>After they arrive in California, the little money they had saved has been used up, and they still cannot find work. The filthy Hooverville camp does not allow them to stay. The police come to make trouble every two or three days. Later, they finally find a place to settle down in the Weedpatch Camp. Here, the poor masses are well-organized, well-equipped, and live a disciplined, autonomous life. However, the problem of work cannot be solved, so they have to leave their ideal living environment and go to a farm to pick peaches. The wages they earn are pitifully small. Because Tom beats up a man, fearing further trouble, the family gets back into their dilapidated truck and goes to another place to pick cotton. There, they encounter a flood that sweeps away their meager possessions and threatens their lives…</p>
<p>I would like to use "The Grapes of Wrath" to illustrate the current situation of American society:</p>
<p>First, American landowners and capitalists have discovered that to obtain more profits, it is not necessary to increase capital and expand the market. Controlling labor and the market can achieve the same goal. The book "The Sixty Families" describes the trend of enterprise trusts and analyzes the political background of each trust, which can help us understand "The Grapes of Wrath." As a result of landowners and capitalists controlling labor and the market, workers are forced to accept the lowest wages in order to survive, but they still cannot make a living.</p>
<p>Second, Washington's revolutionary ideals and what Mencken longed for, "Of the people, For the people, By the people," have not been fully realized to this day. Although American-style democracy gives every citizen a limited freedom of speech, it cannot guarantee them freedom from hunger. In the United States, all freedoms have been transformed into economic commodities due to high capitalization. As a result, the living space of the poor has become extremely narrow. Parking a car overnight in a parking lot requires a considerable rent, and arguing with the police even a few times can get you labeled as a radical. We believe that the U.S. government's progress is too slow and should pay more attention to the people other than the landowners and capitalists.</p>
<p>Third, it is true that the source of modern European and American civilization is Greek and Hebrew thought, and it is true that the spiritual life of modern Europeans and Americans cannot be separated from the church. However, the degeneration of the religious beliefs of the general population is a fact. In "The Grapes of Wrath," the pastor initially doubts the efficacy of prayer and eventually quits being a pastor altogether, which illustrates the attitude of the younger generation of Americans towards religion.</p>
<p>Fourth, apart from the philistine class, Americans welcome guests. A stranger traveling in a foreign land will be warmly received and greeted with kindness everywhere, making you feel as if you are at home. This is because the population is excessively concentrated in cities and life in the wilderness is too lonely. Therefore, poor families like the Joads still use their most precious food to treat unexpected guests. The real American people are lovely, and we should sympathize with them.</p>
<p>After reading this book, we will appreciate Steinbeck's angry emotions, and we ourselves cannot help but feel angry.</p>
<h3>Valley</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>I have long yearned to come here and sing a song, along the winding stream flowing in this valley. It is very desolate, but everything appears so quiet and lovely, like a rose-colored dream for a long, long time; I have long yearned to come here and paint a picture without colors.</p>
<p>Here there are: light soaring of flying birds, murmuring of a small stream, fragrant wild flowers, and the resounding of a high-pitched shepherd's flute on the hillside...</p>
<p>Although it is a foggy dawn, the sound of logging is already echoing in the lush green forest. Cooking smoke is also rising. The working people have already stepped out of the low, damp thresholds to work in the fields. Who would still linger in the bitter dreams of the long night!</p>
<p>Thus, the laughter of village girls tinkles by the stream, a boisterous pastoral song rises from the fields, and the silent valley immediately echoes with the hurried footsteps of travelers heading to distant places.</p>
<h3>Aphorisms</h3>
<p>— Ou</p>
<p>Poetry is a copper flute; a skilled musician can play out its sorrows and joys.</p>
<p>Poetry is like a rainbow after the rain, spanning the heart when people's thoughts are clear.</p>
<p>Poetry is the eye of the soul, in which truth and beauty are hidden; only those who truly love her can comprehend her and be intoxicated by her.</p>
<p>In fact, the essence of poetry is beauty.</p>
<h3>The Oyster Gatherer</h3>
<p>— John Singer Sargent</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>There is also one person that must be met: who? It is the leader of the Fifth Column's special agents, the one-eyed gentleman, Sargent. He is very busy and not always by Konoe's side. But if he happens to be here, he will be a very tricky fellow, because his brain is more flexible than any of the Japanese dwarves. Perhaps he is watching coldly from the sidelines and might be able to expose Tsurumi's plan at once. If he is in Beppu, Tsurumi must meet him. The meaning of this meeting, in Shanghai dialect, is called "bie miao tou" (sizing each other up). Of course, the first sentence of the meeting must be straightforward, telling him that "this is a small matter of opinion among 'our own people' in this country. VIPs need not interfere, otherwise you will be greatly embarrassed." If Sargent knows what's good for him, each will avoid the other, and Tsurumi may not necessarily want to put him in an awkward situation. But if Sargent insists on fighting it out, Tsurumi has already made arrangements, and will not let him gain any advantage.</p>
<p>Meeting these few people has taken up a lot of space in writing, but in reality, if all goes well, it will only take three to six minutes. Even if it doesn't go smoothly and a fight breaks out, it won't take much time because arrangements, both overt and covert, have already been made. According to the original plan, unless absolutely necessary and a major fight really breaks out, there will be no cutting off the electricity and telephone, etc., to cut off Beppu's external support. However, at this time, Tsurumi had only just grabbed a knife and had not encountered anyone. Why were the lights turned off? So even Tsurumi himself was baffled.</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation had changed, Tsurumi knew that things were not good, but in any case, he had to find out the reason. What he could not forget was the basement, where he expected his people, all of whom held important positions, to be in that area. If an unexpected change occurred at this time, he guessed that it must have occurred within that area. Sure enough, when he ran to the end of the passage and suddenly pulled open that small room, he heard the clanging sound of knives and swords clashing. He listened quietly to determine the direction of the fierce battle. Unfortunately, with the heavy doors and stacked houses, high walls and low fences, the echoes were too much, and he could not determine the source of the fighting.</p>
<p>At this point, Tsurumi could not help but be anxious, because the plan had already gone awry. He couldn't care about much anymore and went straight into Konoe's Japanese-style hall.</p>
<p>"Hmm… Hong ji jiu ju…?" Someone shouted in the hall. "Yan," is the opening word of Japanese martial arts, probably imitating the sound of a tiger or lion roaring; at the same time, this hum contains the important meaning of preempting the enemy. But the thing is, the Japanese have too many inherent deficiencies, and the nasal sound problem is too serious. When they try to imitate it, they don't quite sound like tigers or lions. Isn't the secret code of the Black Dragon Society "Kong ji jiu ju"? Why is this one "Hong"? That is also because the nasal sound is too heavy or the throat sound is…究.</p>
<h3>Stranger</h3>
<p>— Su. Libijieff 作, Li Li 譯 (translated by)</p>
<p>It was a summer morning. I was carrying my fishing rod and going to my familiar and favorite place, about two versts from the town, to fish. There I met a man I had never seen before.</p>
<p>"I often come here to fish. Please forgive me, I wanted to sit next to you," I said to the stranger.</p>
<p>"What do you mean? If you need this place, I can let you have it!" he replied.</p>
<p>"Please sit, please sit, you haven't taken my place. Have you been here long?"</p>
<p>"Yes, almost an hour."</p>
<p>"Any luck?"</p>
<p>"Nothing!"</p>
<p>After I cast my line, I began to scrutinize my neighbor. He was about forty years old, with graying hair, an unshaven chin, a dirty, lace-trimmed hat, a greasy woolen undershirt, and a dirty, patched leather jacket, and worn-out, crooked boots. All this gave me a general impression; my neighbor was a poor drunkard.</p>
<p>We sat quietly for nearly an hour without saying a word to each other. By this time I had already caught several roach and carp.</p>
<p>"Eh? What's the matter?" my neighbor finally began to speak. "I've been here for almost two hours, and the bait has only been nibbled at once. You came after me, and you've been 'stealing' all the fish from me."</p>
<p>"If you want, I can give you the fish," I said casually.</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Please forgive me, I never accept charity from others, even if I am a poor wretch in tattered clothes…"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to be charitable," I hastened to explain. "The reason I wanted to give you the fish is just that it is something I don't need."</p>
<p>We were silent again for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"Do you often come fishing?" I broke the silence.</p>
<p>"Often, and you?"</p>
<p>"I come almost every holiday in the summer. It's a very good pastime."</p>
<p>"What do you do for a living?" I continued to ask.</p>
<p>"I... I... I am just who I am!"</p>
<p>"Just who I am, what does that mean?"</p>
<p>"It's very simple, ... it's just, not anyone else."</p>
<p>"I still don't understand what you mean."</p>
<p>My neighbor was so amusing to me that I had forgotten the float on the water.</p>
<p>"In the Tsar's time, I was a clerk in a county yamen, but the work was very heavy and the income was limited, so I quit. Now I am like a free bird, and I can go wherever I want..."</p>
<p>"Didn't you ask anyone to help you find a job?"</p>
<p>"Alas! So desolate! They all say I am an "objector." "Compromiser"."</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"Objector" and "Compromiser" means I am a dangerous element."</p>
<p>"Where do you live now?"</p>
<p>The strange man tapped the ground with his toes.</p>
<p>"Right here on this land with you..."</p>
<p>"Some people call me a vagrant, some people call me a wanderer, and some people call me a poor bachelor, please choose any three of those!"</p>
<p>"Alas, it's been like this for a long time! I don't want anything more. He picked up a big carp and said with emotion: "Good carp, my lovely carp, you show me warm kindness, you give me infinite warmth..."</p>
<p>After he finished saying these words, he threw the carp at my feet, picked up his fishing rod, and walked quickly along the bank.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, friend!" he shouted, about fifty yards away from me.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the strange man turned back, carrying the hat he had forgotten. When he got the hat in his hand, he laughed and said:</p>
<p>"Can you lend me thirty kopecks tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"Do you need it urgently?"</p>
<p>"Because the addiction to half a glass of old wine is acting up" he smiled.</p>
<p>I took out my purse.</p>
<p>"You can take the fish too." I handed him the fish.</p>
<p>"Thank you, not necessary for this one. For your health, I won't bother you anymore."</p>
<p>I picked up my purse and fish basket, and he had disappeared from my sight in a hurry.</p>
