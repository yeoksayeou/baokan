<h3>華盛頓明星報著論　呼籲美國從速援華　軍事觀察員稱蘇正積極援助中共</h3>
<p>〔聯合華盛頓九日電〕華盛頓明星報社論稱，美國如不援助中國，則共產主義勢必蔓延全國，對於美國外交政策關係重大。間題之嚴重，匪特有關美國對華及對遠東其餘各國之政策，抑且有關美國之世界政策。指定存備進出口銀行之五億美元對華貸款旣已擱置，中國政府之財政狀况與美國之對華政策已達於焦點。美國對華貸款原附有條件，即中國政治須上軌道。馬歇爾出任特使調解國共戰爭將近一年之久，即本此種條約行事。馬氏歸國以來，中國局勢每况愈下，多處地方正進行內戰，輕濟情形亦瀕於混亂。假定中國已失去向美借款機會，即聯合政府如包括共產黨在內，勢必聽任其為所欲為，及至最後乃控制全局，否則決難有成。如是，則美政府豈非以不可能者，要求於蔣主席乎</p>
<p>〔又電〕美國軍事觀察員數人，會赴中國考察，近始返美據稱美軍自華北撤退後，蘇聯對華政策已目消極轉積極。「在美軍撤退前，東北及舉北共軍軍火甚感不足，一俟美軍撤退，東北共軍即發動攻勢，並備有排砲，以前則僅有野戰砲一二尊而已一比輩美國軍官相信，朝鮮北部蘇軍正以配備及其所訓練之韓共積極援助中共。</p>

<p>白華德奉召返國經一般人注視　觀察家認魏德邁將使華</p>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕美國公使銜參贊白德華，新近奉召回國，與馬歇爾國務卿有所協商，因此又引起一般人猜測，司徒雷登大使是否將遭撤換？此事若果在擬議中，觀察者認為其可能之繼任入選，當為前中國戰區美軍司令魏德邁中將。魏氏原定繼赫爾利少將任駐華大使，後以此舉恐將妨害國共談判之進行，遂未實現。中共認魏　邁係親政府派，故對之並不歡迎。美國當時不能不顧到中共意見，今則國共公開作戰，已有數月，和談旣無恢復之望，此點自可不必再行顧慮。號德選於戰時在重慶大為蔣主席所激賞，兩人交誼頗篤。當魏氏繼史迪威中將任中國戰區司令時，兼為主席參謀長，雙方合作無間。美政府最近決定以戰時為中國製造之步槍彈一億三千萬發售與中國，此間觀察者多認為美國對中共之綏靖政策將吿結束。司徒博士之任駐華大使，係由馬歇爾元帥特別推荐，認為欲使中國和平統一，司徒係一重要助手，國共雙方對之均具好感，且為一有名學者，於中國文字造詣極深，不意司徒之才識，與馬帥之努力，終屬徒勞無功。</p>

<h3>歐洲到了分合的關頭！</h3>
<p>歐洲經濟復興會議將於十二日開幕，歐洲二十二國，均已接獲英法兩國的邀請，是否應邀參加？都要在這幾天內決定。截至執筆爲止，據法國新聞社的報道，歐洲已有十五國，卽奧地利，此利時，捷克，丹麥，挪威，瑞典，瑞士，土耳其，希臘，荷蘭，盧森堡，冰島，義大利，葡萄牙，暨南愛爾蘭等十五國，已相繼正式表示接受邀請，參加歐洲復興會議，以討論美國國務卿的經濟援助歐洲計劃；此在南斯拉夫與保加利亞兩國，則已表示正式予以拒絕；其餘的五國，尙在鄭重考慮之中。歐洲的「分」「合」，已到了最後關頭，在這幾天內，就可以分曉了。所以這幾天來歐洲政局的發展，實在値得我們密切注視的，美國合衆社外交記者日昨報道稱：「天下一家的理想已瀕於幻滅」，這句話並非言過其實，曰或欲危言聳聽：歐洲的「分」「合」，確已到了十字路口了。</p>
<p>馬歇爾國務卿的援歐計劃，本來是杜魯門主義的第二章，欲以經濟援助歐洲各國復興爲題目，試探蘇聯對於歐洲眞正的意向，從而在美蘇對立的夾縫中覓獲一條出路來。惟因英法亟需美國的援助，聞及馬歇爾國務卿在哈佛大學發表演說之後，貝文外相卽匆匆前往巴黎，先行會商英法兩國的共同態度，然後決定邀請蘇聯外長莫洛托夫赴巴黎，舉行三國外長會議。在當時雖然也有人懷疑莫洛托夫外長能否接受英法外長的邀請，但至最後，莫洛托夫終於到了巴黎，參加三國外長會議，使一般人士大爲興奮，認爲歐洲的前途殊可樂觀了；詎意在三國外長會議席上，發生了非常明顯的裂痕，就是英法的意見與蘇聯的主張，大相逕庭，不啻背道面馳，三國外長愈多辯論，意見愈見紛歧，因此三國外長會議也就不歡而散。</p>
<p>三國外長會議的流產，對歐洲各國而言，實在是一大損失；因爲歐洲各國在大戰期問，遭受戰爭的摧毀，元氣大傷，戰後瘡痍滿目，欲言復興繁榮，勢非取得國外的援助不可；此在英法兩國，亦有同樣的情形；美國旣有願予經濟援助的表示，英法自不能因蘇聯的反對，而輕言放棄美國援助的機會，因此英法乃邀請歐洲二十二國，舉行全歐會議，共商實施馬歇爾援歐計劃的辦法。但是在蘇聯方面，旣認爲英法暗中勾結，而企圖玩弄蘇聯，不願再度參加歐洲經濟會議，自不待言，蘇聯再鑒於歐洲各國均有偏向西方集團的傾向，當然也不願其附庸各國也接受英法的邀請，而參加歐洲經濟會議，以討論馬歇爾的援歐計劃，除了政治上外交上對羅，匈，南，保，芬等國稍稍施行壓力而外，並以穀物接濟羅國，表示蘇聯也有經濟援助他國的意向與實力，可使其附庸各國獲得些慰藉。所以在這種情勢之下，歐洲唯有走向分裂的道路了。</p>
<p>這種局勢的發展，不論從那一個角度去觀察，都是一種令人悲觀的現象，蘇聯雖然一再以「干涉他國內政」攻擊馬歇爾的援歐計劃，並以此爲理由，拒絕參加此項計劃的實施；但在我們第三者平心而論，終覺得歐洲分裂的責任，應由蘇聯負之。因爲美國在提出援歐計劃之後，深恐過分刺激歐洲若干國家，始終保守緘默，從未確切聲明自己的立塲。至於法國新聞社於六月廿七日所報道的美國援歐條件：（一）廢除優惠之關稅壁壘；（二）使各種商務協定具有多國性質；（三）以平等的基礎待遇各國；（四）歐洲內河水道，尤其是多瑙河，一律自由航行；（五）實現德國經濟統一；（六）批准及簽署和平條約；（七）年均分配歐洲之資源，這不過是華府人士的一種猜測之詞而已，並不能視爲美國政府的眞正態度。所以向來親蘇的華萊士，對於蘇聯拒不接受英法的邀請，在其主編的新共和雜誌，也撰文攻擊蘇聯之非是。</p>
<p>要之，歐洲已到了「分」「合」的關頭，局勢的嚴重，幾乎已到了不堪想像的階段，第二次大戰勝利結束，未及兩年，而在盟國之間，因爲不能互信互讓，反而猜疑傾軋，致使在大戰期間世人所憧憬的天下一家完全幻滅，實在人類的一大悲劇，惟據法國外長此杜爾宣佈。歐洲會議自十二日開幕之後，至十五日始能正式開始討論美國的援歐計劃；凖此而論，歐洲的「分」「合」，尙可有五天轉圓的餘地；我們終希望各國的政治外交家，能在這四五天內，運用其政治的智慧，務使歐洲能合而不能分，否則歐洲的前途，不僅沒有和平可言，而且兩個歐洲的共存也是不易維持的，遲早終不免再度引起人類的浩刦。</p>
<h3>捐款勞軍</h3>
<p>上海各界人民團體，爲了擁護政府頒佈總動員令，爲了慶祝四平街國軍大捷早已央定於本月廿日，舉行剿共建國萬元勞軍大會，一切都已在積極籌備之中，勸募委會也將於今晨開會，討論勸募的具體辦法。</p>
<p>我們覺得勸募的辦法，愈簡單愈好。因爲捐款勞軍，是人民應盡的義務，和普通的捐款，截然不同。第一，在後方的民衆，至今還能過着經常的生活，不能小感謝在前綫浴血作戰的將士，假如沒有前綫將士的忠勇作戰，今日之後方，早已淪爲東北或華北的第二，不僅人民的財產沒有保障，而且人民的生命也有朝不保夕之虞了。這幾天來，我們在中外報紙，看到了戰後四平街的慘像，對於如此忠勇衛國護民的將士，怎能無動於中呢？第二，勸募的數目，雖然鉅大，但是利用上海的保甲制度，以一戶一萬一元計算，卽可損得七億元；若以一人一萬元計算，則可得三四百億元；在今日之上海，大家在別的方面節省一點，捐助一萬元勞軍，實在是一件輕而易舉的事情。第三，人民捐款勞軍，就是人民擁護政府動員令的表示；其意義更爲重大；司徒大使在北平說：「總動員令的效果如何，將視人民的擁護而定」。我們完全同慮；人民自動捐款勞軍，實爲人民表示擁護總動員令的最佳辦法。</p>
<p>最後，本着有力出力有錢出錢的原則，我們希望上海富有之家，慷慨解囊，多多捐款！</p>

<h3>英外相今日飛巴黎　準備出席歐洲會議開幕式　波羅保南匈五國決定拒絕英法邀請</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十日電〕頃悉：英國外相貝文定十一日午後飛往巴黎，外交部經濟顧問赫爾巴契同行。貝文將留法，至巴黎經濟會議開幕之後。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：匃牙利已正式拒絕參加。匃國經長時間會議後在市達佩斯發表聲明稱：「此種會議所有大國並不全體參加，匃牙利未　出席，深以為數」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十日電〕波蘭，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞及南斯拉夫，拒絕英法之邀請，不參加本星期六在巴黎召開之討論馬歇爾援歐計劃會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社赫爾　　十日電〕芬蘭內閣十日舉行會議　　法之邀諧作最後之討論，決議可望於十日晚揭曉。又外務委員會曾於十日最八時集會研究各國經濟局勢之秘密備忘錄。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕被邀參加本星期六巴黎會議之二十二歐洲國家中，至今日即提出答覆之最後以期為止，僅餘阿爾巴尼亞芬蘭兩國尙無表示。其餘業已接受者有十五國，拒絕者有五國。業已肯定拒絕之五國為保加利亞·羅馬尼亞·南斯拉夫·波蘭及匈牙利。南斯拉夫表示拒絕應邀之照會，指責建議中之援歐計劃，將使若干國家威脅他國之經濟生活及獨立。波蘭之照會則曰小國之極利並不能獲有保障，且就邀請書之條件觀，任何對於建議設立之機構擬提出之修正意見或其他修正案，均已彼預先排斥。羅馬尼亞之決定拒絕，並未說明理由。最近聲明接受者為挪威·丹麥·瑞典三國，係於三國外長在哥本哈根開會後決定接受。業已接受之十五國為奧地利·利時·捷克·丹麥·南愛爾蘭·希臘·荷蘭·冰島·義大利·盧森堡·挪威·葡萄牙·瑞典·瑞士及土耳其。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕偷敦十日廣播：蘇聯管方通訊社塔斯社指責英外長貝文及法外長皮杜爾甘心為美國利用，以達到組成歐洲國家集團使蘇聯陷於孤立之目的、。上項電訊蘇聯各報均以顯著地位刋登，為蘇聯報紙對於馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃最露骨之批評。該社並指責美英法三國企圖拉攏德國西部加入集團。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十日電〕法外長皮杜爾吿法國民議會稱：巴黎會議之最初三日，將專作會議組織法之辯論。會務討論於星期二開始。皮杜爾說明德國在開會期間，無代表參加。稍後，英·美·法三佔領區軍事長官可能會商此一問題。</p>
<h3>波蘭拒絕參加歐洲會議　係出於蘇聯壓迫　美國務院官員所持見解</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕美國官員對於波蘭拒絕參加巴黎會議討論馬歇爾計劃，認為出於蘇聯壓迫。國務院方面以波蘭大使館曾於兩星期前聲明贊成馬歇爾計劃，又况波蘭如參與歐洲復興事宜，獲益必大，今忽右此決定，殊覺失望。波蘭會請美國資助，今旣決定拒絕參加巴黎會議，則此種請求不免失去力量。同時此間主管當局對於捷克決定參加，益表尊重之意。蘇聯對於捷克是否將使用同樣壓力，尙不可知。將來蘇聯可能强制修改捷克選舉法及其他限制法令，俾使共產黨能在捷克政府中更為得勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕捷克駐美大使沙拉維克稱：捷克決定參加巴黎會議，可終止「關於鐵幕之論傳」。渠謂，渠從未懷疑捷克將出席巴黎會議。</p>
<h3>聯合國要求獲悉　歐洲會議經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖九日電〕聯合國代理秘書長畢爾德今日在此稱；聯合國未被邀派觀察員列席巴黎討論馬歇爾計劃之會議，惟渠已促請英國允許聯會國獲悉此次會議之全部經過。畢氏于　依赴挪威旅行期間，代理其職務。渠並重申賴依之希望，即盼蘇聯對馬卿計劃之拒絕，並非對該問題之最後表示。</p>
<h3>捷克代表團抵蘇　蘇外長親往歡迎</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科九日電〕捷克內閣總理高德華爾特與外長馬薩克率領捷克代表團前來蘇聯訪問，於本日午後抵此，莫洛托夫外長與維辛斯基外次曾親自至飛機場歡迎。此外捷克商務代表團由司法部長特萊奈率領，亦已行抵莫斯科。</p>
<h3>蘇不應拒絕參加　歐洲經濟會議　華萊士發表見解</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐約九日電〕華萊士頓在本期「新共和雜誌」發表一文稱：蘇聯應接受巴黎會議所給予之機會，今未能如此，致馬歇爾計蘭將造成世界分裂局面之嚴重危機，此次會議乃爭取自由世界之第一會合，雖屬失敗，但並未全盤盡失。以國際主義者之立塲而論，吾人當　責軍事援助反蘇政府之杜魯門主義，但對馬歇爾所提出之計劃，吾人則在原則上表示贊同。以經濟援助各國，協力復興世界，國會執有世界和平之鑰匙，共和黨若一日恐懼歐洲之社會主義進展，則馬歇爾計劃不能得其良好結果，反將招致惡果。若以為美國在聯合國會議內不獲得充份之擁議，以制服蘇聯，故欲縮小聯合國　　經　委員會之任務，　欲推行馬歇爾計劃，即終必歸於失敗。但余以為蘇聯應接受巴黎會議所給予之機會，蓋蘇聯若不參加，則推行馬歇爾計劃之結果，將招致世界分裂之危機故也。若不取消杜魯門主義之哲學，則世界形成分裂局面，終必歸於失敗。此種哲學，惟在結成西歐集團，使德國成為對付蘇聯之堡壘耳。</p>
<h3>蘇聯猜疑心　為和平諒解障碍　羅斯福夫人分析蘇態度</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約九日電〕羅斯福夫人今在其每日專欄中稱：蘇聯之猜疑，為和平反諒解過上之眞正障碍。伊於回答蘇聯為何未參加聯合國之一切活動時，乃引用前總統之言曰：其理由之一即為蘇聯需要最佳之人才，從事國內建設，故蘇聯顧在此方面選擇良好人才，而不願挑選合格人才担任各種聯合國活動？關於蘇聯為何認為其他各國須完全接受其計劃，而不能作何修改以實現合作　一點，羅夫人答稱；甚多年來，蘇聯素為其他國家所隔離，故蘇聯在與他國接觸時，常懷有猜疑乏心。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕有署名「X君」者在本月出版之外交季刋發表一文，足以代表最高權威方面意見。據稱二美國必須以「勁敵而非合作者」對付蘇聯許多年。蘇聯苟能如是被抑制十年，或十年以上，其結果非使其採取更合作之態度，即足以使其勢力瓦解。外交界官員認為此種見解係反映國務卿馬歇爾新政策設計團主任喬治肯尼之思想。此文論據則為蘇聯當局望並期待資本主義世界最後不免崩潰，此際蘇聯領袖一面乘機在國內宣傳「資本主義包圍之威脅」，一面在國外向弱國方面到處擴展勢力，以組護自身之獨裁制。唯一關鍵則為蘇聯行動並無一種時間表其進退完全以敵對勢力之强弱為轉移。以策略而論，蘇聯不能常在等待而無所成就。美國如能計劃此種弱點，會同其他西方國家，採取一種堅壁河野政策，加以監視，則不出十年或十五年，則蘇聯勢力非軟化即破裂。</p>
<h3>蘇對美債務償息</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社舉盛頓九日電〕國務院頃宣佈：蘇聯政府業已依照協定之規定，償付利息四百十七萬美元。</p>
<h3>安理會續討論　巴爾幹糾紛　美拒絕折衷案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖九日電〕據可靠消息：法國與哥倫比亞已向美國提出折衷方案，藉以調和美蘇兩國對於解決巴爾幹糾紛之意見。美代表團已予拒絕，仍堅持設立半永久性質之調査團遏阻希臘邊界糾紛，並信可得安理會法定七票多數予以通過，聽任蘇聯以否決權為擱阻之唯一武器。</p>
<h3>美參院核准　陸海空軍合併案　建議統國防部長指揮</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕參議院今日核准陸海空軍永久合併折衷法案。此案係杜魯門總統兩年來一再要求而擬成，現已送交衆議院討論，該院共和黨領袖認為必須通過。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕參議院十日以口頭表決，一致通過一項立法案，任命國防部長一人，以指揮全國武裝部隊。</p>
<h3>英希望與美國成立　平時租借協定　以免英國經濟崩潰</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕英政府或將設法與美國成立平時租借協定，以免英國經濟崩潰。副總理莫里遜與財長達爾頓昨夜已在下議院作露骨表示，謂美國對英九億三千七百五十萬美元之貸款，正在迅速消耗中。依照目前之速率，冬末將耗盡。莫里遜復稱：「唯一補救辦法，在以價値數十億美元南北美洲貨物運來接濟，而無需立即以歐洲相等之貨物運往交換。英國目前平均每年負債四億五千鎊，以償付糧食與原料，保持稀少之口糧及綏緩復原之工業。美國再度援助後，吾人生產與生活標準將大為調整，吾人不能無限制轍入不能付値之貿易」云。今晨各報均研究政府此項政策，僅工黨「每日先鋒」報表示緘默。</p>
<h3>美小麥輸出　本年可望參加　將為援歐計劃主要部份</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕國際糧食會議本日在此間開會，到有四十二國代表，由法總理賴瑪迪致歡迎辭後，即一致推舉法國農業部長普利香為大會主席。美代表即該國農業部長安德遜發表演說稱：每年一次之穀物運動，已宣吿開始，美國今後對於世界穀物之進出口貿易當能有具體之貢獻，但穀物之匱乏情形，在來春之前，未必能有顯著之改善。估計美國今年小麥之收成將為十四億蒲式耳，故其輸往國外之小麥，或可較上年略多。美國目下存儲之玉蜀黍亦較上年為多，但主蜀黍，大麥，及燕麥之秋收，恐將較去年為遜色，以是小麥之收成雖將增加，但穀物之總收成則可能較上年為少。余樂於宣佈在美國今年所當輸往國外之榖物中，小麥之數量將予增加。總之，糧食生產之增加，尤其是穀物產量之增加，無疑為馬歇爾援歐計劃之主要部分，歐洲應立即開始促成其結果云。</p>
<h3>美參院兩黨集團提議　強化聯合國機構　主張賦予權力防止戰爭</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華感頓十日電〕美國曾於昨日提出議案三項，目的在使聯合國機構具有堅强手腕，重新開始，若蘇聯妨碍進行，並有將其拋開之誠。據衆院民主共和兩黨議員十人宜稱，召開聯合國新憲章會議，賦與聯合國機構以執行世界法律防止戰爭之權，此為決定蘇聯是否志在征服世界之最可靠方法。參議院民主共和兩黨議員十人則提議由杜魯門總統召集改組聯合國機構會請，修改憲章，以增强其組持世界和平之力量，或無需蘇聯衆加即可進行。提案人之一，並會同其他參議員兩人另行提出一案，主張授權聯合國機構，以制定解釋及執行法律，維持世界和平。</p>
<p>眾院中所提出之議案，內容與此相同。主張由國會促請總統按照憲章規定，主動召集聯合國大會，目的在使該機構能制定，解釋並執行世界法律，以防止戰爭。據其發表之聲明稱，「提案人認為欲決定蘇聯是否志在征服世界，其最可靠之方法，莫若探知蘇聯是否願與他國共同創造一能保障其安全之聯合國機構。以兩，年來之經騐，使聯合國會員確信聯合國機構如欲維持世界和平，則其實力必須增强。提案人認為美國援助希土及歐洲復興之直接行動，已明白表示聯合國機構在目前之形式，殊不足以應付此分裂世界之重大壓力。至於美國不願以國際管制原子能之權交與安全理事會一節，可姑置不諭，同時在辯論援助希土案時，業已證明不僅國會議員之一般意見，認為聯合國機構係我人對於和平之惟一希望，且有一種極强烈之主張，贊成增强聯合國機構，使其能執行任務」。按照憲章第一〇九條，可由大會會員三分之二，外加安理會任何七個會員之同意，即可召開憲童會議。但非經安理會美蘇英法中五常任理事全體贊同，即不能修改憲章。同時在成功湖方面，據聯合國機構職員宣稱，目前如欲將聯合國憲章大事修改，或不免引起此世界機構之破裂。某聯合國機構方面評論美國會中之提機案稱，在“前情形下修改改憲章，絕對無此機會，美國如有何種嚴重行動，或將使聯合國機構壽終正寢。</p>
<h3>美減稅法案　總統擬再予否決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：杜魯門總統今向記者稱，渠將否決共和黨减縮所得稅法案，按衆院已通過該項法辯，參院則於今日開始討論。</p>
<h3>杜魯門將召集兩黨領袖　討論馬卿計劃立法問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕頃自消息靈通方面探息：杜魯門總統定於星期一在白宮否集民主黨與共和黨六位領袖，舉行會議，屆時將向之提出實行馬歇爾援歐計劃之立法。被邀六人即參院議長范登堡，參院共和黨領袖懷特，參院民主黨領袖巴克萊，衆院議長馬丁，衆院共和黨領袖哈萊克及衆院民主黨領袖雷本。杜魯門計劃之內容，雖來言明，但衆料當係關於制定馬歇爾計劃之立法，及在必要時在本年內召開國會特別會議，以討論外交政策等事。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：杜魯門總統今日稱：渠將於本年秋季召集國會特別會議，實施馬歇爾援歐計劃，但目前則無召集之必要。</p>
<h3>白金漢宮空前盛會　慶祝英儲君締婚　婚禮大約在明春前舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：伊麗莎白公主今日由斐利浦議巴頓陪同出席白金漢宮園游會。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕英王喬治六世今夜宣布同意英國王位繼承人伊麗莎白公主與蒙巴頓海軍上尉之婚約，公主年廿一歲，上尉即前希臘斐列浦親王。白金漢宮今夜發表之宮廷公報有云：「英王及后以極愉快之心情，宣布其愛女伊麗莎白公主與皇家海軍斐列浦蒙特頓上尉（即已故希臘安特魯親王之子）締結婚約，英王對該項婚約業已欣然同意」婚禮日期迄尙未定，然據權成方面今夜消息，婚禮大約將於明春以前舉行。伊麗莎白公主之婚姻須與一七七二年皇家婚姻法之規定相符，英王之同意締婚，即係本於該法規定，婚禮之舉行亦待英王之批准，屆時樞密院將召開特別會議，並請帝國代表，國會，及反對黨領袖，以及敎會首長列席，由英王正式批准公主之婚禮。英王之同意婚約，業已通知艾德禮首相以及加拿大·澳大利亞·紐西蘭·南非·南羅特西亞等自治邦總理。不列顚共和邦各地之賀電，業已紛至沓來，惟白金漢宮今夜並未舉行儀式，明日下午宮中或將舉行園遊會，屆時公主及蒙巴頓上尉均將參與。</p>
<p>依據憲法辦理手續</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕伊麗莎白公主與蒙特頓上尉締結婚約後，依據憲法規定，將採取下列之步驟：（一）文德禮首相將在下院正式向議員宣布公主之婚約，上院中亦將作類似之宣布。（二）兩院將通過決議案，批准公主之婚約並致賀意，婚禮之舉行當母需再經國會同意。（三）國會應決定公主及其夫之年俸，公主未成年時，年俸六十鎊，成年後增為一萬五千鎊，結婚以後可望提高至六萬鎊，惟確數須經國會以特別法案通過。（四）蒙巴頓上尉可望獲得貴族最高級之公爵銜，並參加上議院。</p>
<p>戰爭初期情苗深種</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦九日電〕據白金漢宮非宜方透露伊麗莎白與斐列浦婚禮將於十月間在威斯敏斯特敎黨舉行。據悉斐列浦上尉於若干時前，已以三粒大鑽戒一隻，贈與伊麗莎白公主，但公主尙未在公共塲所中帶此戒指。斐列浦係於一九三九年戰事爆發前數月，至達特茅塞海軍學校參觀，乃與公主初次邂逅，當時斐列浦十八歲，公主十三歲，彼此見面之時，並未交談，但在大戰期內，則常相聚首，尤在斐列浦之舅父即現任印督蒙巴頓之家會面次數最多，戀愛則因此開始。但直至本年一月間，始提出婚議，其時英王尙請其稍待，待四月間英王一行自南非巡遊歸來後，英王始表同意，有情人遂成眷屬。</p>
<p>天生佳偶終成眷屬</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦九日電」英國未來女王之夫婿斐列浦蒙巴頓，本係希臘親王，為希臘王室之第六承繼人，為與英王儲伊麗莎白公主締結良業起見，於本年初入英國籍，改姓其舅印督蒙巴頓勳爵之姓，其祖先半係英人，半係丹麥人，係英王喬治六世之表姪。出生柯孚島，容貌英俊，據悉結婚後將獲公爵銜，並將依照習慣，皈依英格蘭敎會。斐列浦四歲時，即託於蒙帥敎養，肄業於蘇格蘭及英格蘭，十八歲進皇家海軍學校，一九四〇年赴海實習，為海軍少尉候補生。斐列浦現任海軍上尉，年廿六歲，身長六呎二吋，體重一八五磅，雖為希臘與丹麥之血統，但頗具英人風度。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播，紐約太陽報載稱，原子秘密文件被竊，頃由杜魯門總統在記者招待會中予以否認。</p>
<h3>敘利亞醞釀內戰　德拉茲旅陰謀推翻敘政府統治</h3>
<p>〔合衆社大馬色九日電〕此間阿拉伯報紙九日載稱：德拉茲藩族現已在叙利亞與外約但邊境幾貝爾區集中，等候該族酋長阿脫拉契發動內戰之命令。叙利亞總理馬拉達宣稱：叙政府對推翻幾貝爾區叙當局之陰謀甚為關切，（按幾貝爾區乃戰前在法國代管下之自治省）敘總理並已將此事通知外約但國王阿勃杜賴。傳幾貝爾區之非德拉茲族官員鑒於形勢嚴重，携帶其眷屬及財產逃走，蓋叙政府與德拉茲族之調解企圖失敗後，阿脫拉契酋長即下以武力解決之命令。同時，叙總理已下命逮捕達里柴，緣渠乃一九二五年革命領袖之一，此次新陰謀之計劃，亦與渠有關。又訊，叙總理曾宣佈，渠已獲得大馬色城中三反對黨領袖參加比次陰謀之證據，但在日前大選時期中，渠不擬下令逮捕彼等云。</p>
<h3>蘇生產激增　大部均超過目標　設計委員會發表報告</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科九日電〕蘇聯計設委員會今日委員，一九四七年　　　　時期增加二千萬英畝，工業生產則增加百分之十五。運輸各部門一亦見改善。春耕計劃已完成，本季糧食生產超過目標百分之十。紡織業與輕工業生產提高百分之二十八，零售商業提高百分之二十。今年上半年度房屋之建築較去年同時期增加百分之十四。第二季其他生產均超出預定目標，其百分比如下：藥物二十九，化學品十五，電器十三，橡膠十四，建築與舖路三，煤斤二，重機械工業五，機械工具五。倫敦方面認為蘇聯於巴黎經濟會議開幕前四日發表此項統計，殆欲證明其正担負牛個大陸復興之重任。</p>
<h3>印尼臨時政府　日內可望成立　荷仍要求合組警察隊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞十日電〕據十日荷蘭通訊社報吿：荷蘭所建議之印尼臨時政府，不久將成立。據共和國發言人稱：副總統哈泰與前總理沙利可能為印尼在臨時政府中之代表。荷蘭方面可能由內閣顧問開次與經濟顧問伐蘇斯特拉頓代表，並由范莫克任首席專員。西婆羅洲最可能由議長哈密特第二代表，而東婆羅洲或將由情報部長泰哈加與不管部長克拉普洛斯任代表。同時，印尼副總理西提亞傑已回返目惹，設立國內保安部渠可望於明日返巴對此作詳細之建議某共和政府發言人吿荷蘭通訊社稱：可能成立屬於聯合政體下之「特別師團」總理夏里福亭以及副總理西提亞傑與加尼等定於近日內視察爪哇與蘇門答臘之荷印軍前綫，俾完全停止戰事。</p>
<p>〔路透社海牙九日電〕荷蘭內閣今日召開特別會議，討論印尼昨日致荷印總督范莫克之補充照會。荷政府將於明日在國會發表印尼局勢之正式聲明·據權威方面息，荷政府當建議由荷雙方，就合組警察隊之一點，舉行商談，然後再接受印尼之答覆，蓋除合組警察隊之點外，印尼對荷方於五月二十七日可從照會中之各點，悉已同意故也。印尼讓步之消息，使荷政府殊感欣慰，</p>

<h3>「羣聲」過不了五關</h3>
<p>〔中央社新加坡航訊〕菲律賓羣聲籃球隊去歲在國內打平半壁江山無敵手，可是此次南征馬來亞，却給把守第五關之新加坡聯隊擊敗了，四十六比四十一，積分相差兩個半球，此一戰羣聲不只輸而且輸得欠漂亮，球員發脾氣，不服裁判員判處，甚至在是後一節中，數度堅欲中途退塲停賽，其好勝恥敗之偏見與情感衝動，竟把運動道德和體育精神，完全置諸不顧，因是引起極多觀衆之不滿·而鼓噪呌打。本來羣聲在星數戰，予人印象很好，這次越軌失態，不僅失去觀衆之同情，且使過去美譽掃地，誠令人不勝惋惜。</p>
<p>海外球迷大嘆觀止</p>
<p>羣聲於本月十三日與香港星島足球隊聯袂抵星，預定在星比賽七塲，其中二塲是慈善賽，替此問一福建會館籌募敎育基金，十五日晚初顯身手，即以六十比四十七苦勝新加坡混合隊。（我說苦勝因為羣聲曾破例在上半塲以三分之差，屈居下風）。此後，羣聲挾着戰勝餘威，一口氣破下三關，以四十九比卅七勝雪蘭莪隊，五十四比四十二勝工商隊，（工商除於一九四六七年連獲全星錦標賽冠軍）七十四比六十一勝霹靂隊。此數役，羣聲演出恒佳，精湛之技藝與良好之精神，使星洲人士讀賞不已，尤其是蔡文華之躍起翻身隻手投籃，球怪蔡文章之滿塲飛，陳金德之進退攻守，指揮若定，以及所有假動作，車輪戰（菲語所謂「拉務拉務」）蝴縣穿花等戰術，令海外球迷大嘆觀止。本來各關守軍，不無名手，如宮邦傑，尹鴻翔，李國銳等，都是中原宿將，可惜年事已高，與體力充沛之　聲健兒相比，實也無法較量</p>
<p>第五關碰上了勁敵</p>
<p>不過，話說回來，馬來亞體育水準，究竟還不能算低，老邁者固難為敵，但靑年伙子還是照樣驍勇，羣聲隊衝過了四重關，却終在第五關碰上勁敵新加坡聯隊，栽了一個大跟斗。論陣容，新加坡聯隊擁盡全星精華，實力不容輕侮，中鋒黃夫錫身長六尺二寸，與好萊萊影星賣萊古柏一樣高，搶球投傳，又快又準，前鋒林文典，黃樹浩，後衛李異南，侯深湖，又都是身經百戰的勇將，陣容很合理想，另一方面，羣聲已經戰了數場，打法和弱點，多少暴露一些，而被他們窺破，所以未戰之時，報章評論，認為此一戰星聯即敗，亦不會敗得太慘，羣聲縱勝，亦將勝得費力·羣聲自知道一戰退上強敵，故亦以最堅強的隊伍登塲，蔡文華，蔡文章，陳金德，陳金置和楊人輝，但隊伍雖堅强，結果還是打了一塲敗仗。照道理講，勝敗為兵家當事，輸了球本不要緊，可惜羣聲好勝心過重，完全忘却了道德與精神，敗陣時於萬目睽睽之下失了態，因而弄出不愉快之塲面，弄出被觀衆喊「打」，隊員於賽後還被人包圍，差一點離不了球塲。</p>
<p>經過情形是這樣的</p>
<p>情形是這樣的：不愉快的事起於球賽第四節，離終塲約六七分鐘，積分脾上羣聲正以九分之差，居於劣勢，後衛楊人輝於亂軍中，截得了球，沿着邊緣疾運向前衝，情勢正緊張，　聯防衛上前擱住了，正所謂「說時遲，那時快」，大槪彼此身體互相接觸，裁判員銀笛一聲，判楊人輝犯規，在楊人輝看來，這一次錯在對方，而自己竟反受罰，認為栽判欠公允，立即提出抗議，但裁判員不賣帳，抗議無效，乃憤然離場，裁判員又判以技術犯規，於是羣聲全場停賽，副領隊蔡達文，亦出場交涉，正爭持不一，觀眾呌囂，秩序大亂，經駐星總領事伍伯勝出面勸解，比賽才勉强繼續·羣聲隊員經此一激，舉動已失常態，不上二鐘，已起糾紛，陳金置犯規，又被判出塲，於是羣聲怒火更增，全體再穿上外衣，又經多方勸說，終由李世僑胡秉鈞蔡連科陳金德蔡文華五人，勉力上陣。最後一分鐘雖一度趕至只差二分，但終於以四十六比四十一終塲。（未完）</p>
<h3>星島南征觀感　（二）</h3>
<p>小告山奴的演出，最是令人失望，他職司右翼，而常常錯走內鋒的位置，結果有好幾次球吊右翼，而他卻不及接應，控球技術，亦遠不如前。正前鋒馮景祥的「老等球兒到脚」的毛病，尙未除掉，他是一個典型的設計師，他從來就沒有頭上的工夫，也沒有衝刺硬刦的勇氣，他的優點，是配發兩翼和替內鋒造就射門的機會，這一點技能，在中國球員裏面，至今還沒有人跟得上他。這一次在星洲幾塲比賽中，短傳遙送，他是有過相當的表演，但因為他不能搶，不敢射門，總覺得有點美中不足。不過以四十多歲的人，尙能維持這樣的水準，的確値得我們敬佩。內錄黎兆榮的脚頭勁而準確，是星島前鋒綫最具威脅性的一員，他射門的工作，可以不擇角度，不論是翻身橫射，抑或迎球直踢，都有他的方寸。他還有一點超人的本領，就是鎭定，雖在頭脚錯雜的亂陣中，他依然指揮若定，能够淸淸楚楚看出敵方破綻的所在，他的弱點，就是不大喜歡跑，原因或許是太胖了。　星島足球隊勝在前鋒富於機會取巧，而彼此間更具有充分的諒解和合拍，他們是臨門不迫，應射不誤，傳遞敏捷，變化機警，但他們的守衛卻成反比例，進不能盡控制輸運之功，退不能效防敵兩翼包抄之力，結果敵鋒一進，瞬即迫門，釀成極度險惡之形勢，在這各局面之下，自己的前鋒，便不能不退後助防，等到車圍獲解，球向對方繞進的時候，前鋒已經來不及推選，這樣簡直把前鋒綫弄到疲於奔命，到了下半場，便成人倦馬乏，精彩盡失，這種現象，在最先三次比賽，確有顯明的證據。首戰星華，三比三迫和，星島所得三球，都在上半塲射入的，下半塲不特毫無進取，反而被星華一連還奪三關。次戰軍聯，雖以五比一的絕對優勢制勝，但所得五球，也是取諸上半場，而下半塲的結果，只是零比零。三戰星民聯，五比三，雖然有四球是下半塲射入，但四球都是在最初十分鐘裏，乘前鋒未衰的時候獲得的。此後便變了草木皆兵的階段，星民聯雖然只能奪回兩球，可是當時他們的優勢，簡直是一面倒，只可惜前鋒射門欠凖，和不會爭取機會，不然恐怕星上在這一場吃了敗仗。星島守衛力的薄弱，一直無法補救，所以到了迎戰馬華那天，剛好碰到前鋒失常，於是便全軍瓦解。本來星島的前鋒，三是失常，又遇到陳家壽陳家萬這對鐵壁後衛，更覺相形見絀，弄到一籌莫展，這是星島失敗的生要原因。（聞星島已邀請陳家壽參加英倫之遊）</p>

<h3>未獲進口許可證之外棉　中信局定收購辦法　代紡及墊紗外銷辦法尙待商擬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於本年四月卅日以前到埠，無法取得進口許可證之外棉，前經中央銀行決定，委託中央信託局代表政府收購。中信局爲辦理此項工作順利推進起見，特於昨日下午三時許，在該局召開小組會議，到中央銀行邵曾華，吳長甫，中國紡建公司張似旅，徐贊三，第六區棉紡公會榮一心，審計部　治權等，由中信局張煦主席。討論至五時卅分散會，決定大要如次：</p>
<p>收購範圍</p>
<p>（一）去年十一月廿四日以前起運，本年四月卅日以前到埠無法取得進口許可證者，予以收購。</p>
<p>（二）去年十一月廿四日以後起運，惟於十一月廿四日以前售出，（售與花行或紗廠）本年四月卅日以前到埠，無法取得進口許可證者，予以收購。</p>
<p>（三）本案向信局申請收購，規定七月底爲截止期限，逾期不予受理。</p>
<p>收購價格</p>
<p>（一）收購價格，應按照國外打包廠，售予本埠進口商之售貨合同原定價格（True　C.I.F.Volue），並應附具當時銀行所開信用狀或其他押匯等有力證明。</p>
<p>（二）進口商售予花行或紗廠之傭金概不支付。</p>
<p>（三）到埠後應付棧租及其他必需之國幣費用，亦得核實支付。</p>
<p>付款辦法</p>
<p>核定價格後，申請人將所有單據，送交中信局，經核明後即辦理付款手續。</p>
<p>又關於代紡棉紗詳細辦法，及向各廠墊紗外銷辦法，請中國紡建公司會同六區棉紡公會先行商擬，再與中信局治商決定。該批棉紗，將由政府接洽外銷，以期早日換回外匯。</p>
<p>棉商意見</p>
<p>又訊：棉花商業同業公會，前日下午召開同業談話會，討論到埠外棉收購問題，至下午四時散會。會後據該會理事長劉屏蓀語記者稱，自中央銀行公佈收購到埠外棉處理辦法後，本會亦即奉到通知，嗣即召葉有關同業數度磋商，聽取意見後，本人即向中信局接洽，雙方會談之下，癓結點即爲匯率價格問題，難以接近。蓋中信局對收購棉花規定，依照棉商過去向國外訂購時所取得之定單，已繳付之美金，依照官價匯率折合國幣，付給棉商。此點使棉商非但無利，反致虧蝕，故棉商不能承認。綠棉商過去即用黑市外匯，均較官價爲高，且此項棉花，訂購期間，大都爲去年十二月及今年一二月爲最多。彼時國外棉價以　米特林每磅扯價總在三角八九分左右，目前已達四角四分之間，故依照訂購時定價又相差不少，似此殊使棉商雙重虧折，自屬難以犧牲。但本會爲顧全官商兩方各有困難，曾提出折衷辦法。（一）請將棉商過去所付美金，仍以原數發付，准棉商動用，其拖欠外商未付部份。請中信局自行料理。（二）棉商所儲之美金，當局如必須收回，棉商要求將價格依照目前美國價格計算。匯率方面，亦請酌量補貼。</p>
<h3>外股統債續疲</h3>
<p>外股昨成交仍少，業外奄無刺激，市價遂再趨疲。電話環境不利，所跌仍多。英聯亦因脫手者多而軟化，怡紗自晨初八一五〇〇元起，微降至七九〇〇〇元結束。洋行有納，證券帮及散賣紛紛。結果較前收計電話跌落一成，英聯亦降半成，餘股則升沈不一。</p>
<p>公債昨仍趨疲，統丙晨開七一〇〇元，即吿低落至六三○〇元，而後略回，最後在六八〇〇元左右徘徊，結果較前收計甲乙丁各降一〇〇元，丙戊亦降二〇〇元，業中人若三六〇室五四九室有供，五三九室五〇三室則進，成交約二百萬左右。</p>
<p>三種公債抽籤還本</p>
<p>民國二十五年復興公次還本，民國二十八年建設公債第二期債票第十二次還本，及民國三十年軍需公債第一期債票第九次還本，財政部於昨日上午十時在滬舉行抽籤，計（一）復興公債中籤號碼十八支，應還本六百十二萬元。（二）建設公債抽籤十支，應還本三百萬元。（三）軍需公債抽籤五支，應還本二百萬元。</p>
<h3>戰前存款問題</h3>
<p>銀錢業提供保證　司以請免假執行</p>

<p>華股昨値永紗增資前最後一次掉期之日，活動者咸放棄永紗，轉取信和以代，以致信和漲停後有貼價成交，永紗則高很步回，而以疲態結束。小股型以景福新光最爲俏利。晨開見穩，遞永紗開後，曾逢掉期套賣，五四號一〇四號有供，一五七號一四二號二三一號一一七號均賣現永紗，而迫低至一〇八八〇元。現永紗亦達一〇四八〇元低價。二三四號二二四號二四號八五號六九號進至一一〇〇〇元外，一七七號一〇六號三六號以及套利者均售，尙有掙扎。八五號二二四號一三七號二二三號二三四號一五四號一〇四號一八一號三一號一〇五號進至一一四二〇元，信和忽起大量買風，八九號一六〇號八四號二二四號一五九號六九號俱進，取永紗而代，一再步昂，漲達停板。遞永紗六一一號一八五號一六三號逢高有供，八九號一七一號亦賣現永紗，而將遞永紗迫低至一一二〇〇元。無如信和漲勢仍烈，人心不無留戀，二一八號六五號二〇七號一四二號進至一一四二〇元，七六號一四八號三六號六九號乘勢套出，遞永紗下挫至一一二五〇元以下，其奈此時人心仍好，信和現交由一五二號，遞交由一一六號八號均掛漲停板。遞永紗且由一五二號一九號買進，現永紗由二二〇元吸納，十時二十分遞永紗再漲到一一四〇〇元外。遞信和且暗市貼價六十元之多。美亞新光景福各見生氣勃勃，惟永紗旣將實行增資，大部份業中大戶均在陸續溜走，以套轉信和美亞，塲外息價開高甚巨，是以一五四號二一八號一八三號拋出現永紗，二三一號八三號二二四號一八三號五四號七六號三二號一二號一〇二號一四二號八九號存多紛紛出籠，十二時十五分遞永紗步跌至一〇七六〇元低價。經二一九號二二號之吸收，尙回升至一〇九五〇元，二二四號二一八號一二九號一四八號等仍來了結，午收退爲二八〇〇元。收後六一號等有納，最後升至一〇八五〇元以上。現景福猛躍十元收市，興遞交祇相差二元之微，流通籌碼極見涸竭，結果與前收相較即交股計信和漲停，新光美亞微升，華豐中法平平，永紗勤興微降，永公景福各漲半成强，新華獨跌一成有零，商務景倫漲半成强，火柴中絲五和大通國貨徵升，麗安跌半成，新亞內衣微挫。遞交股計信和漲停，景福新先美亞各漲一成左右，永公華豐各升半成，永紗雖升而有限，動興尙見微降。塲外各老股計世界仍難振作，餘均穩定。</p>
<h3>現遞套利交易不多</h3>

<h3>人造絲下挫　廠經交易沉靜</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲始呈堅穩，終因供求失衡，遂致下挫，一二〇號旭字有光，開盤喊三千一百萬元，最大喊一百五十萬元，並未成交。很因賣聲充斥，價呈下瀉，至中午收盤已退做三千萬元。東洋有光三千〇三十萬元有成交，下午人心仍虛，再跌入三千萬元關內，最後價爲二千九百七十萬元。一五〇號有光及七五號半光，因絲織聯營公司發配綢廠爲數甚多，但不合實用，故充斥於市，價亦猝降。一五〇號有光與二一〇號價相同，七五號半光比一二〇號有光只大起三百萬元。</p>
<p>昨市廠經交易甚靜，市價平穩ABC等級仍無交易，只做關D字等級價三千三百三十萬元，E字等級價二百八十萬元，不過貨款供有一星期期頭，零擔成交價中級貨二百萬元，高級貨三百萬元，干經市價仍無變化。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨繼續下挫，美亞被面三百四十萬元，大誠被面二百七十五萬元有成交，很喊八十萬元。華强貨二百七十萬元亦有做開，大誠格子壁縐挫勢更厲，開盤爲四萬千元，節節下降，最小做過三萬九千八百元。後經大戶拉提，　挽頹勢，然終無起色。收市即期價爲四萬元，隔日期做零四百元。華錦縐隨原料而稍軟，昨市高檔貨二萬七千元有成交。</p>

<h3>夏季宜忌街售冷飲及熟菜</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>近見沿街酒舖食品店及食物攤，有冷飲料者，有熟鷄熟肉等者。此等飲食物最易招引蒼蠅的吮集，實爲傳播傷寒霍亂菌的媒介。現在若不及早預謀，日後一旦疫疾流行悔之莫及！但禁之過嚴，則容易引起騷擾及不安。過寬則視若無覩。最好方法，在乎提高民衆知識，使自知其害，不願購飲或購食，則售者無利可圖或竟致虧蝕，安有不自行改業之理。爰製標語於左；街售冷飲是病菌的集中池。街售熟菜是疫神的播種塲。</p>
<h3>你貧血嗎？</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>疲倦，困乏，無精力，可能是貧血的結果。貧血病减弱了無數人的工作效率，在戰時發現貧血病，世界各國毫不懷疑其進行，而侵害千百人的生命。現在有許多關於貧血病的事實，你知道嗎？請看：</p>
<p>貧血病缺乏紅血球——對的。患貧血病的人，可能是紅血球的不足，或可能是紅血球數正常，而紅色血素不足。</p>
<p>貧血病是一個新的疾病，一個文明的產物——不對。早在一六七〇年，英國醫師Sydenham即認淸了貧血病，同時用鐵治療此病。早期的醫學記載中，亦提及貧血病。肝治療惡性貧血病，是在美國最近才發現的。</p>
<p>血色素是造成紅血球為紅色的物質——對的。血色素是輸送氣同二氧化砍的複雜蛋白質，並包含鐵質，微量的銅與另外必要的物質。</p>
<p>除掉出血的損失，紅血球爲身體不變的部份——不對。血球是不斷地死亡，也不斷地新生，一個紅血球的平均生命可能是少於三個月。</p>
<p>紅血球數時常隨著傳染增進——不對。那是白血球隨着傳染增進。許多傳染，特別是璉菌屬侵染，紅血球衆目是降低。</p>
<p>較身體的需要量，產生更多的紅血球——對的。新生血球數慣常是較永久存在的爲多。當小孩子生命開始的一天，準備儲蓄鐵質在肝中，紅血球便破壞了。</p>
<p>蒼白色時常爲貧血症——不對。而色蒼白可能有貧血的原因，但所有蒼白的人，不一定是貧血。許多人有充分的紅血球，與血色素，仍好像是蒼白色的，原因爲他的血管，不能使血液到迷皮膚的表而。許多人紅血球幾乎必須减少至百分之五十，貧血的蒼白才能察見。</p>
<p>貧血病無症狀——不對。非惡性貧血例，虛弱同疲倦等病狀，時常在一短時期以後發現。和緩的貧血病時常結果爲呼吸短促，心贓雜音，脚同踝膨脹，同頭痛。嚴正的貧血病，有時因爲麻本，腹部的增大，聾，蒼白或黃色皮膚，同指尖增大。</p>
<p>一自然冷」的人平均大概是貧血——對的。紅血的缺乏，可能爲低微溫度易過敏地增長。</p>
<p>設若一個人是貧血，能由他眼嘴角的紅襯物判決——不對。設若貧血是嚴重的，那可能是色素充分的損失。但是强烈的懷疑，並不是完全可靠的。</p>
<p>診斷貧血正確的方法是血液計數——對的。正確的血球計數可以判斷貧血的發生與程度，以及其現象，或紅血球的缺乏，此爲唯一的診斷方法。</p>
<p>貧血發生的最大原因，由食物中鐵質的缺乏——對的。必須記着，貧血的原因爲鐵質缺——時常稱爲續發性貧血，或營養性貧血——這是通常見到的。有十二種不同的型態。貧血原因在嚴重傳染時。如惡性貧血，出血性貧血，　疾，鈎虫病同梅毒是一種少數的型態，而不是由鐵的缺乏</p>
<p>孕婦貧血可能傳送疾病與孩子——對的。孩子身體是依靠母體內鐵的供給，同另外必要的成份以組成紅血。一個貧血的母親生出的孩子，出生後可能不貧血，但是無充分的鐵儲蓄在他的體內，當他生命的第一年，他是可能發病的。</p>
<p>不貧血的產婦，無貧血的孩子——不對。特殊的貧血，可能虫不貧血的母親傳送，這是由遺傳的因素，而不是不適宜的飲食，也非輕率，完全是姙娠時的原因。Mediforranean。種族便發現這一型的形成。另一種原因，稱爲有核赤血球的貧血，在最近尙未發現。孩提時代輸血通常能遏制這些于遠傳性的貧血。</p>
<p>設若一個孩子完全飲用牛奶，他將不貧血——不對。牛奶中雖然含有極微量的鐵，但這種生命的要素，牛奶中仍是少有。新生體　常需要足够的鐵，以適合其需要。但是，除非含有鐵的食物是在出生後八九月以內充分供給，貧血病將可能發現。</p>
<p>預防貧血病，食物中必須用肝——對的。肝含有遏阻惡性貧血的必需要的物質，以防止中年或老年的貧血。不過，不應僅需要此一種食物。但無諭如何·肝是富於鐵的好食物。</p>
<p>易於供給防止貧血的食物是當於鐵者——對的。食物最實有鐵質者，包含所有的五穀，蛋黃，肝，瘦肉，菀豆，豆，棗，梅乾，葡萄乾，大黃，黃豆，菠菜，同蕪，靑菜，芥菜同甜菜，蔬菜，花柳菜，白菜心，豆芽，蘆筍，馬鈴薯同菓實亦是富有鐵質</p>
<p>菠菜可以用於每一種食物，因爲那是防止貧血的食物——不對。當菠菜含有鐵質時，存在於綠色多葉食物中的物質，將不能强迫孩子們吃食。</p>

<h3>傷寒三字經</h3>
<p>— 壽梧靑</p>
<p>目下天氣失調，晴雨無定，忽爾　燦爛，霎時陰霾奔騰，雖急性流行病症較稀，但僞寒之感染，據臨診所見，有增無减。且傷寒以正型爲多，副型較少，故病期頗長。戲擬「傷寒三字經」一則，俾供兒童閱讀，對於促進夏令衛生，不無裨益。</p>
<p>傷寒病，傳染病。諸兒童，都曉聞。</p>
<p>感染易，要當心。病期長，眞害人。　熱度高，費苦心。莫延誤，頂要緊。</p>
<p>有病菌，如桿形。具織毛，活靈敏。　從口腔，傳進門。汚蒼蠅，做媒人。</p>
<p>濟伏期，要二星。起初時，察熱緊。</p>
<p>寒不退，熱不淨。出點汗，像瘧病。</p>
<p>吃白藥，不會靈。有咳嗽，多鼻　。</p>
<p>常便閉，或瀉痢。粥湯水，都難進。　發白瘖，出紅疹。徒睡眠，好呻吟。　腸出血，加雜病。腸穿孔，怕得很。</p>
<p>三禮拜，病减輕。想飲食，死逃生。</p>
<p>皮包骨，瘦乾凈。少血色，像人精。</p>
<p>看一看，眞怕人。葡萄糖，來打針。</p>
<p>維他命，快吃進。速調理，慢起身。</p>
<p>勸弟妹，　衛生。常洗手，滅蒼蠅。</p>
<p>節飲食，　禍根。謹牢記，却百病！</p>

<h3>再談鈣丙合劑</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>自從鄙人在本刋第四期提出本問題以後，接着在第十期，第十三期，第十五期，第十六期，見到沈，吳，注諸氏先後發表之高見，開研究之門，啓貢獻之路，諸君子之功，誠然不可湮沒也！</p>
<p>本問題關係重大，不獨學術上有其是非，醫療上亦受其影響，個人之成見事小，病家之利害實大，骨鯁在喉，一吐爲快，「余豈好辯哉，余不得已也」！</p>
<p>（一）禁酸一說，本不一致，數十年來，有主張禁者，有主張不禁者，各持異說，各具理由，各有師承，各有學派，門戶之爭，非一日矣。余宗Sergent氏之說，以為進行性之肺癆患者，缺鈣旣多，需鈣尤甚，酸旣尅鈣，則在鈣劑治療期間，禁酸一說，當然爲合理之理論。至汪氏謂」胃液本屬酸性」，內服之鈣，已受其影響，初不需禁酸而已然也，殊不知普通在服用鈣劑之前，例須飲制酸水一杯，以中和胃液，使胃酸不能逞其作用，而達鈣療法之目的，此何說耶？且鈣丙合劑之內服藥，在外國成藥當中，少見其例，以余所知，祇有鈣丁合劑，如CalcipotD之類。而鈣丙合劑，祗有國產某葉廠，爲供給我國醫師之需要，始有如Calcivit　C之出現，此又何說耶？縱觀汪氏不禁酸之說，亦具相當理由，若果能有公開的實騐之證明，余不難敝蓗Sergent氏之學說，「盡棄其學而學焉」。</p>
<p>（二）沈氏謂「結核病一定缺乏鈣素」，主張對於肺癆患者，一律施以鈣劑療法，此點未敢贊同，蓋肺癆爲多型性之疾患，有缺鈣者，有不缺鈣者，如纖維型及石鈣型之肺癆，病灶鈣素，已達飽和程度，若再注射鈣劑，勢必如沈氏所謂「排出體外」，則注射等於不注射，縱無大害，亦無寸益，此沈氏所以「持續二三年」之久而鮮效也歟？</p>
<p>（三）老年肺癆，多爲頑固慢性疾患，進行活動性，究居少數，注射鈣劑與否，當視病人而異，若不問病型，一律施以鈣劑，則米免近於盲目。</p>
<p>總之，本問題非空言能解決，必須施行：（甲）屍體剖騐，將曾經服用或注射鈣丙合劑之屍體，檢視其病灶，（一）有無不溶解性之鈣塊。（二）若有鈣塊，屬於何種鈣鹽。</p>
<p>（乙）動物試騐，取天竺鼠數頭，使之結核化，然後投以鈣丙合劑及單純鈣劑而比較之。</p>
<p>（丙）臨床實騐，將肺癆病人分爲兩組，一組注射以鈣丙合劑，一組注射以單純鈣劑，同時食譜禁酸，而檢騐其尿中有無鈣素之排泄，及比較其排泄之量。</p>
<p>如此則眞理方可大白於天下，質之沈吳汪三氏，以爲何如？</p>
<h3>預防黃熱病！</h3>
<p>— 柴特林</p>
<p>在倫敦歐斯頓路一座大洋房的六層樓上，有五個穿着白色外套低聲細語的靑年，正在埋頭工作，製造一種黃色的粉末。這座洋房就是衛爾康熱帶藥物化騐所的所址，在對抗熱帶各種死疾的戰鬥中是一個發號施令的軍要機關。那些靑年所製造的黃粉是一種防疫苗，可說是人類抵禦黃熱病的第一道防綫。</p>
<p>我們預防黃熱病的傳染，就賴注射這種活的病毒——種奇妙致疾介乎生物與非生物之間的東西，不是尋常的光學顯微鏡所能察見。但是預防黃熱病的注射和預防天花的接種牛痘，雖然都牽涉到活的有機體，頗有不同的地方。牛痘苗是從牛身取來，接種之後便患牛痘。用作黃熟病防疫苗的病毒則是在歐斯頓路實騐室裏經過多年的培養和紫殖而來。最初的一絲毒苗已經用人工方法繁殖了幾千次，因爲只有靠實騐室的培養才能製出足够的病毒以應需求。衛爾康化騐所和世界上其他實騐室所用的毒苗都呌做「十七D」，是最初毒苗的變形，和天緣湊巧的產物。</p>
<p>這毒苗的故事一部份是英屬黃金海岸土人阿悉比的故事，二十年前一個在菲洲研究黃熱病的英美考察團從染着此病的阿悉比身上抽得了一些病毒的標本。英美兩國的實騐室就接着進行研究。有一天，在培養着阿悉比病毒的美國實騐室裏看到了異常的發展，就是那病毒（注射在猴子身上）不再發生病微，它已經失掉了使人害黃熱病的能力，雖則有使人經久不被傳染的功效。不久以前，英政府殖民部鑒於阿悉比捐獻病毒，有益人類，還賞了他一筆養老金呢。</p>
<p>製造這種防疫苗的需時十六天，等到經過最後的試騐，可貯而待用，共需三星期。在製造程序中，非常借重普通的鷄蛋。衛爾康化騐所就每月用蛋一千多隻，平均每星期二百六十八隻，這些鷄蛋乃來自彌得爾塞克斯，肯脫，和薩立各郡的農塲。</p>
<p>在衛爾康化騐所每星期開始新防疫苗的製造兩次，每次數批。鷄蛋自農塲或販商送來後，先在華氏一百零二三度的溫度中孵化九天，讓胚胎生長。到了第九天鷄蛋從孵卵器取出後，就在一具特製的機器中迎光加以檢查，不能生育隨即棄掉，其餘的都汪黃熱病的病毒。</p>
<p>在注射的時候，實騐室裏的氛圍有似手術室。動手注射的是高級技術助理葛林氏。他因有功防疫苗的製造工作，曾獲得不列顚帝國獎章。在注射的時候，他載上透明的面具，以防鷄蛋的傳染疾病；蛋面上更擦以酒精，因此空氣中有消毒劑的濃厚氣味，皮下注射用的針頭，每三個蛋便掉換一根，俾萬一針頭染汚，鷄蛋換壞的數目得以减少。</p>
<p>注射所費的時間每個蛋一秒鐘。他利用指頭向下的壓力敏捷地把針挿入，每個蛋各注射十分之一西西的病毒。經過這樣注射的鷄蛋平均每一個可以產生足够百人用的劑量。有時候一個蛋多至二百劑。於是再把鷄蛋放在孵卵器中三天或四天，讓胚胎裏的病毒繼續生長。（參閱附圖）</p>
<p>到了第十二或十三天，這才把胚胎從蛋壳中取出，和水磨碎，如是所得的混合物放在試管裏，用遠心力機很快的加以轉動，使粗大的粒子都沉到管底，上面剩下一層溷濁綜色的液體，就是防疫苗。這防疫苗還得經過試騐，看是否染有微菌。</p>
<p>到此爲止。每一個試騐都是爭取時間的戰鬥，因爲病毒是極脆弱的有機體，非俟液體弄乾變成粉末隨時都有死滅的危險，等到變爲粉末之後，也只能保存一二個月，並且必須維持恰當的溫度，最高不能超過攝氏四度，這是爲什麼防疫苗從實騐室送出的時候，都包裝在置有冰塊的保溫瓶或置有二氧化碳冰的匣子裏。</p>
<p>在防疫菌的製造過程中，第十六天上才變成粉末。這是先把液體置入小玻璃管內，使其冰凍，然後用一種乾燥法達到目的。</p>
<p>但是在這批防疫苗可以取用之前，還須解決一個問題，這就是極重要的劑量問題，究竟多少份量才能收免疫的功效？換一句話說，道批防疫苗中含有多少病毒？因此，又得把粉末用幾千倍原含的水量把它冲淡後，加以試騐。根據這試騐的結果，始能推知每批防疫苗中病毒的力量。</p>
<p>製成以後的防疫苗像大粒的黃色藥片。使用的時候，須在蒸溜水中把它溶化，注射到人體上去祇費短短幾分鐘的時間，但注射以後，百分之九十到九十五的人，可以至少有四年功夫完全不怕黃熱病的侵襲了。</p>
<h3>孵卵器內的鷄蛋</h3>
<p>鷄蛋孵化了九天之後，棄掉不能生育的，其餘都注入黃熱病毒，在孵卵器再放上三四天，這才從蛋壳中把胚胎取出，假使聽其自然的話，再過八天，就將孵出小鷄。（英國新聞處攝）</p>

<h3>小雨點</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>都只為花事太匆匆，縱不愛花，也在賣花的姑娘前駐足了。</p>
<p>那個年靑稚氣的賣花姑娘用期待的目光朝人盈盈的笑。</p>
<p>『這個，』她揀起一束濃紅的，半開的花，是玫瑰；問：『您要麼？』</p>
<p>『唔—？要，不要……』我正凝神瞧着那邊的粉牆，是誰家院子裹的紫藤花，開得那麼盛？許是花枝細軟，有一串被風吹下來，掉在牆外的地上。……</p>
<p>『到底要不要呢？』她將手裏的花朶舉得再高一點，玫瑰花的影映上她的臉，她也有着花一樣的靑春，她可不知道。她只想用花換得買米的錢，因此她的臉上現出悽惶的焦急。</p>
<p>我點點頭，吿訴她要的。</p>
<p>有着玫魂花影的臉頰，遂平添了一絲欣慰的笑意。</p>
<p>當她把那束玫魂交給我的時候，我請她檢起那枝掉在路上的紫藤。</p>
<p>她有點義異，然而也高興的做了；還笑嘻嘻的說：『您連牆脚下的花也都歡喜嗎？』</p>
<p>『為什麼不呢？……』然而我沒有說出。</p>
<p>她笑我有幾分傻氣，我也憐她有幾分傻氣……</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>夏季逐漸成熟了。又一年的花，葉，夜鶯，畫眉——</p>
<p>綠暗紅稀，你不嫌春光的短暫麼？</p>
<p>一個打南國歸來的朋友問：『吿訴我，你愛不炎炎的七月？』</p>
<p>我朝她不經心的點點頭。</p>
<p>她笑了：『什麼是這一個季節裏最令你神馳的呢？』</p>
<p>『看芙　放蕊，聽雨打芭蕉，』我思索了一下：『還有，夜晚的凉風，天上的巧雲，池塘裏的蛙聲，高枝上的知了……』</p>
<p>『唔，』她沉吟着：『在江南住久了的人，就會欣賞這些個溫靜舒徐的美。』</p>
<p>『怎麼？你，不覺得這些是最可愛？』她的話呌我茫然了。</p>
<p>『我愛的是驕陽，颶風，驟雨，閃電，和迅雷。』</p>
<p>『不嫌太刺激一點兒嗎？』我笑起來：『從前你也不的，一次不算太長久的旅行，你帶來了南國的熱情。』</p>
<p>她沉着的笑了笑，問：『難道你沒有覺得：刺激的，象徵了生命的熱情的，不是比溫和平靜的更好麼？』</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>月朗風淸的仲夏之夜，在燈明人靜的屋子裏，我們曾無語相對。</p>
<p>她忽然起了惆悵。</p>
<p>『如此良辰美景，就是有什麼傷心事，也該暫時遺忘。』我勸她。</p>
<p>『遺忘？』她抬起含愁的眸子：『除非是滄海變成又要。』</p>
<p>『啊，為什麼你總對於不可再來的往昔，有太多的懷　？那是不太好的，我以為。』</p>
<p>『我也這樣想。』她低聲的說：『不過這不止是懷戀而已。』</p>
<p>『還有什麼呢？』</p>
<p>『也許是悲憤？連我自己……也弄不明白。』</p>
<p>『悲憤？』我詫異的仰起了頭，這肅問她。</p>
<p>她點點頭，補充道；『悲憤一個朋友的死。』</p>
<p>『一個好朋友，是不是？他死得太慘，也太年靑了。』我太息着。</p>
<p>『還有死得太平儿，』她道麼解稱：『所以我將永遠不能遺忘，永遠為他悲憤，直到我死，也要將這無限憂傷，帶到墳墓裏去。』</p>
<p>『你愛他？』</p>
<p>『請別這麼說，』她莊嚴的答：『我並不為着愛而變戀於往昔，只是因了他的死而恨——』</p>
<p>『我明白你的意思了，你惋惜他的死亡——一個有為的靑年這遇到無名的犧牲，你永元悲憤。』</p>
<p>『是的，老鷹絕不能夠和烏鴉死得一樣，一匹怒馬怎麼可以不死在沙塲上呢？』她微昻着頭，抬起向上的險和深思的眼：『一個英雄模樣的人怎麼可以沒有一個英雄的死法呢？』</p>
<p>『一個英雄模樣的人怎麼可以沒有一個英雄的死法呢？』我　意重複她的話，吿訴我們朋友中的英雄，以及一切英雄的朋友們！</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>我從不曾想到怎肅為自己安徘下一個墳墓。或是憶及一個最知己朋友的死。</p>
<p>然而，有一次——</p>
<p>『如果一個最好的朋友死了，』他問我：『你打算怎樣紀念？』</p>
<p>『不會是你吧？』</p>
<p>『也許是我哩！』</p>
<p>『是你，那麼，』我思索了一下：『不間斷的到你的墓園去，獻祭一束黃色的鬱金香，或是冷艷的白芍藥，如果是風雪料峭的大冷天，我一定會帶來一枝幽美的寒梅……』</p>
<p>他無言。</p>
<p>『嫌不好嗎？』我莫名其妙的朝他投以一瞥；『這些，不都是你所愛的？』</p>
<p>『那是我生前所愛的，却不一定是死後所需要的。』他莊重的說。</p>
<p>『是的，我還得囑咐他們用常靑的松柏點綴你寂寞的墓地——』</p>
<p>『那倒不，』他打斷了我的話：『我並沒有想到需要一個墳墓。』</p>
<p>『啊，明白了，』我恍然如有所得：『如冰心女士所說，在風淸月白之夜，將遺骸埋葬海洋之底——。我猜得對麼？』</p>
<p>他明快的笑了起來：『唔，一個詩人的想法，其實，海底未必能夠安眠，或許還看不見珊瑚</p>
<p>『……』</p>
<p>『……』我茫然，不知所云了。</p>
<p>『你就想不到其它麼？糊塗的人，記否有一句話：我們的墳墓不在地上，在人家的心裏。』</p>
<p>『你是說，』我呌起來：『我會將你遺忘？不，不，那是絕對不會的；我記得你，永遠，永遠。』</p>
<p>『我想，我也希望。』言似的：『你不是曾經說過？人類有最強烈的記憶，是上帝最殘酷的安排。』</p>
<p>『感激上帝如此的安徘，』他笑了。又喜悅，又惆悵：『還謝謝你；你知道麼？能夠遺忘是最幸福的事，但是被人遺忘却是頂頂不幸……』</p>
<p>——才是的，活夜人家的記憶裏，是最美的墳墓，勝似永生！你不這樣想麼？</p>
<h3>綠窗新語</h3>
<p>— 子振</p>
<p>傳奇文雜集的『綠窗新語』，在明代流傳很盛，從諸家書目中可以看出。牠和託名湯顯祖輯的『虞初志』（確出凌性德的依託），題王世貞選的『艷　編』（疑亦出凌　初弟兄輩之手）同樣風行。三書所收都是傳奇文，『太平廣記』是牠們的一個主要來源。後二種時代較晚，故兼收明人之作，『綠窗新語』則無宋以後的著作。</p>
<p>明嘉靖間開州晁瑮『實文堂書目』（「北平圖書館月刋」三卷二期）子雜類著錄『綠窗新話』，實即此書。又別著錄『綠窗紀事』一種，似另為一書。萬曆間朱睦　『萬卷樓書目』（「玉簡齊　書」）卷三也曾著錄：『綠窗新語四卷』。二家書目都不題撰入，不知輯於何人之手。近人『書舶庸談』卷四記所見日本細川店頭的鈔本題：『皇都風月主人撰』。又淸錢塘相氏『八千卷樓書目』，也著錄此書。八千卷樓藏書半歸南京蟠龍里國學圖書館，這書不知是否也在內；即使曾經庋藏，現在也不知是否存在。此外南潯劉氏嘉業堂也有一部，現在也不知存佚。所惟，國內外收藏的三部，現在都無從寓目；能見到的只是『書舶庸談』轉錄的全書目錄而已。</p>
<p>原書雖不可見，但牠的成書時代還約略可以知道。宋元羅燁『醉翁談錄』（日本景印本）首卷『舌耕叙引』論說話人的小說一家謂：</p>
<p>『……幼習「太平廣記」，長攻歷代史書，烟粉傳奇，　蘊胸次之問，風月須知，只在　物之上，「夷堅志」無有不覽，「琇瑩集」所載皆通；　哨中哨，莫非「東山笑林」，引倬低倬，須還「綠窗新話」。……』</p>
<p>牠旣和「夷堅志」並列，又在『醉翁談錄』之前，其中又沒有宋以後的著作，那麼，成書的時代當在南宋，編者是皇都的臨安行在的人。</p>
<p>這書編刋以後，也常有變遷。元楊朝英『太平樂府』卷七越調門鵪鶉套，周仲彬『詠小卿』首曲云：</p>
<p>釋卷挑燈，　今覽古，妬嫌風，埋雲寃〔怨〕雨。因觀金斗遺文，故造『綠窗新語』。自忖度，有窗腹；好做得是也有鈔茶商，好行得差也能文士夫。</p>
<p>按周曲所詠是宋伎女蘇卿（小卿）和書生雙漸，商人馮魁戀愛事，本事見明梅鼎祚『靑泥蓮花記』卷七。宋樂人張五牛有諸宮調，元雜劇也有不少以這事為師材的作品。金斗為廬州金斗郡，是小卿的產地，故云。『結窗新語』當這書。這可相信：元代會將小卿故事也收入『綠窗新主』中，而這故事正是元人最喜歌詠的（元散曲中極多）。但見存日本藏本却無此項記載，這當是鈔本以宋刋本為祖本，所以未收；而此事僅見元人的『增補』本。其次是書名也不統一：鈔本和周仲彬曲及『萬卷樓書目』作『綠窗新語』；而『醉翁談錄』及『寶文堂書目』作『綠窗新話』。其中或不兔有筆誤，但這未必是主因；大約還是原本就如此分歧，而二字形義相近，故易於混淆。然而二者當是一書，似無可疑。</p>
<p>這書所錄一百多簿傳奇名目，也給我們不少啓示：『鄭德璘傳』據此書及『歲時廣記』，知出於唐裴鉶『傳奇』，足正明陸楫『古今說海』的誤題。『金彥遊春遇　娘』（出「剡玉小說」）和『情史』參證，即『醉翁談錄』話本名目中的『錦莊春遊』。『楊愛愛不嫁後夫』（出蘇子美文，但今本「蘇學士集」不載），是話本『愛愛詞』所本『崔寳羨薛瓊彈箏』（源出「　情集」），又見『歲時廣記』，即元白樸『薛　月夜銀筝怨』，鄭德輝『崔懷寳月夜聞筝』兩種雜劇及元代南戲『崔懷寳』所本。</p>
<h3>聖母受胎啟示</h3>
<p>— 葛萊柯</p>
<p>葛萊柯（EL　Greco　1545-1614）本是希臘人，因為久居西班牙，並且為西班牙藝術奠定了基礎，所以一般史家都把他列入西班牙美術史中。</p>
<p>他信仰宗敎，所作多以宗敎神話為題材，嚴肅而有力，善用色彩，並以色彩象徵事物。所作人物雖多誇張，但並不使人感到怪異，不安，這亻風直影響到現代。</p>
<p>「聖母受胎啓示」就是其最有名的作表作之一。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>往事</h3>
<p>— 蓮子</p>
<p>雖然我沒有見過廣大的海洋，但水總使我有太多的愛戀。我羨慕它的自由，因為在它惱怒的時候，可以波濤澎湃地宣洩它的怒火；不像我，要整天深藏了自己原有的善良的靈魂，提心弔胆地在人民的風沙裏飄浮；甚至在悲苦的時候，也不讓我痛快地流一滴淚。</p>
<p>記得有一次在郷間，我伴同母親　着一葉小舟，去拜訪一個遠親。因為路途的遙遠，我們差不多還在黑夜的蓋頭就動身了，排開了兩岸低垂的樹梢，經過這一段狹小的河面，正當黎明的時候，舟已駛航在都山，麓下的廣闊的河面上了。河水平靜的像老尼的心情，沒有一點世俗的波紋，朝陽剛漏出半個紅艷的臉兒，把滿　的水都染成金赤，在淸流的水底，我可淸楚地看到一莖莖的水草，與大大小小的魚兒，它們成羣地在水草裏穿游。小舟在水草的梢頭滑過，魚兒偸吻着浸沉在水裏的船的邊沿；我睜大了眼眀注視這一切，我懷疑自己傲游在夢境。</p>
<p>河裏淺灘上，成雙作對的水鷗，在那兒相互洗刷它們的羽毛，有的完畢了它們的晨課，徜徉在空中追逐嘻戲，間或有一二隻孤獨的水鷗，形單影隻地佇立在水邊，伸長了頸項，像在期待他失去的友伴的歸來。</p>
<p>這是，一雙水鷗，盤旋在我的上空，我正深深地祝頌他們的幸福與自由。突然一聲槍聲，射中了其中的一隻，頓時它喪失了可貴的生命，自空中落下，另一隻却在一聲哀鳴裏逸去。看着這殘酷的一幕，我禁不住驚呌起來，急得母親在船艙裏來不及的給我呼靈，她以為我給槍聲受驚了。其實她何嘗知道她女兒的心情。含着淚悵望着失事的天空，我悽惋良久，我哀憐這隻蒙難的水鷗不幸的遭遇，但我更痛惜生還的那隻水鷗的命運。自今以後，它將在多少懷戀與悲痛裏，去追念它那永不復返的情侶？它又該在多少寂寞與凄凉裏，顧影自憐地度這悲愁的日子？</p>
<p>人類為什麽要如是殘酷呢？難道他們不該有自由相處的權利？我黯然了。</p>
<h3>莎翁逸事</h3>
<p>— 東方蒙霧</p>
<p>當莎士比亞還沒有成為著名的詩人劇作家時，曾一度和喜劇家眞蓀在倫敦的劇壇上相互競爭過雄長。不過，有時眞蓀之喜劇的演出，竟連招待費也無法抵銷；而莎翁所創造的人物，只要一登塲，戲院的客滿牌便會立刻高掛在門口了。</p>
<p>但是，眞蓀非但毫不妬忌，憤恨，埋怨，却反因此而非常的欽佩莎翁。就在一次莎翁的劇本刋行時，眞蓀竟把他和希臘，羅馬以及歷來的大作家相媲美，同時還寫了一首詩：</p>
<p>『英國啊，你有一位詩人可以自豪！歐洲的劇景，都仰仗他底聖績奇功。他非一時的學者，乃是萬世之文龍。』</p>
<p>據說莎士比亞生前是非常害怕死後自己的墳墓會遭遇到別人挖掘掉的命運。因此，他就堅決地拒絕了死後葬在威士明德寺，並且還親自撰了這樣的一篇墓誌銘，刻在他的墓碑上：</p>
<p>『請你看耶穌面上，不要挖掘這墳墓。誰肯保留這幾塊石頭的，但願他福壽齊增；誰若來　擾我骸骨的，但願他絕子絕孫！』</p>
<p>別輕視了這篇短銘的威力，傳說後來那些想看一看莎翁遺體的好奇者，都被它所唬倒了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血339</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「一」W君搖了搖頭；「那僅僅指南口一方面說的…中央收到我們這一方面的報吿，…當然還有其他實地調查報吿，就像前些日子，戴先生親上東北，等等。…中央得到這些資料，所以火急訓令晉閻，轉調大將，防堵南口…南口是西北半壁的咽喉，卡住那　，守，可以穩定半壁江山；攻，可以動搖日寇南下的主力，是一個最重要的地點…</p>
<p>「可是中央防堵南口的訓令，雖說十萬火急，受令的却是晉閻；因這一帶虎區，早已劃歸晉閻負責，訓令到了閻老手裏，當然有些耽擱，斟酌人選等等」等到湯恩伯得到這項訓令，已經七月三十夜半了。虧得湯車動作迅速，就在三十一午夜到八月一日零時之後，幾小時內，趕到南口，佈置了搶堵的防綫；湯部大軍，也火速從綏東趕到，把總司令部紥在懷來…</p>
<p>「同日，幾乎可說同時，日軍方面，議定八月五日之前，先在平津平漢來一個大攻勢，作為響應『八之秘密』的動作；一方面仍由坂垣抽調部下，依照原定計劃，走平綏綫去接應由張北南下的倭軍。誰知他剛剛走到昌平，我軍却早一步在南口險要，佈置得差不多了。我說『五分福命，五分僥倖，』就是指的這一點…您想這等重要所在，假如呌倭軍先到一步，…」</p>
<p>「這居庸關南口一帶，是我國九大要塞之一，平津一帶，鬧到如此地步，就說中央沒有收到情報，難道就不注意？……」我揷口問着W君。</p>
<p>「防軍當然有的，可是力量小得可憐。」W君說到這裏，不禁搖頭嘆息：「………總而言之，人事問題罷了！………」W君靜默了睛會，好像要把衝動的感情抑壓下去似的；隨即又從沒思的狀態裏，猛然驚醒轉來：「………還是來討論渡過南口的問題罷。」他又指點桌上舖的那張軍事簡圖，給我瞧：</p>
<p>「假定您到了昌平，那就算『十五號』方式的行動終點。再往西行，當然就是兩軍的防綫口上，一切交通工具，除了馬匹以外，大槪都行不通。您得步行就是騎馬………可是您看——」W君指着地圖：「南口這個地形，坐西北，朝東南；後背就是居庸關，一帶長城，做了屛風。這南口的西面一帶，從雙嶺口起，都是巒山絕嶺，東面一帶從馬鞍山起，也是重重疊疊的高峯，綿延數十里；所以只有前面這一綫狹道可通………」</p>
<p>「我明白。」我知道W君的意思，這時要沿平綏路上張北，探尋　羣小老虎，最多只能走到昌平。南口旣已佈防，一般行人，當然斷絕往來，揷翅也飛不過去了；除非冒險，穿過「無人境地，」平安找到我軍前哨，應用W君正要替我佈置的方式前進。但這「無人境地」丙軍的前哨都可隨時射擊；要想平安過去，怕不容易。這一點早經W君看到了。</p>
<p>「您聽！」W君不讓我打斷他的話路：「………南口的前綫，大槪直頂屛障這個要塞的大門，一個呌做龍虎口，或稱龍虎台的高地帶。從昌平到這裏，還隔着大約三五里。這三五里的一段路上，情形如何，我這裏還沒有一人情報，所以無從猜想。這………」</p>

<h3>「百年大計」</h3>
<p>— 十郞</p>
<p>因為各方的動盪不安，它直接影響到學術界，敎育界，使他們都深深地感染到工作與生活都在紛擾不安的狀態中。</p>
<p>前兩天，我們看到各方祝賀一位大學敎授執敎廿五年，這是値得慶賀的；但一個小學敎師，在現在這個生活狀况下，怕就不容易呌他熬廿五年吧。</p>
<p>我們並不為敎育界洩氣，我們以為，無論大學，中學與小學的敎授或敎員，在現在這是候，格外應該使他們有一個安心敎學的環境與心境。那意思即是說，不要把不安的情緒再去打擾這些身心憔悴的敎育工作者。</p>
<p>中國有句古老的話，呌作「百年樹人」，意思即是說，一個人得到一個好的敎養，並不是一朝一夕之功；而這「百年樹人」的責任，正落在敎育工作者的肩仔上。</p>
<p>所以，當我們看到市小校長聯誼會向敎育局請願，以及大學敎授聯誼會向敎部提出的要求中，都口口聲聲請保障職位，迅發聘書，俾得安心工作等等的話，這個聲音，在現在聽起來，是多麼悲切，又多麼使人心酸！</p>
<p>敎育為「百年大計」，我們一定要使它不受任何波動，不受任何干擾，使從事敎育的專才，能够一面敎學，一面硏究，使落寞枯寂的敎育園地，能够從此欣欣向榮，那就是中華民族的福音了。</p>

<h3>南宋初年之外交</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>報載監委某等因王世杰對蘇外交軟弱，業已提出彈劾，並經于院長批准審查成立云云。王氏個人對國家之功過，姑置不論，要之，作外交官者，內受國策之限制，外應國際之　化，其一言一動，未必皆出於自心，即出於自心，亦未必有裨於大局，　外交演奱至今日，已非「子產有辭，　實賴之」之時代，然則對蘇態度之強弱，中樞旣定計於先，蘇聯復藉端於後，王氏個人，不過逶迤執行之而已，功過云何有？</p>
<p>近讀宋史，覺南宋初年之外交，正復與今日有相同者，茲略比較於後，以符鑒往知來之旨。</p>
<p>所謖「南宋初年」，此處係指高宗，孝宗，光宗，寧宗四代而言，其外交對象，不似今日之裑雜，蓋遼已亡，元尙未興，曰和曰戰者，僅指北方之金人而已</p>
<p>初，康王構南渡，即位於建康，用李綱為相，宗澤守汴，當時頗有恢復中原之志，會黃潛善汪伯彥用事，帝惑之，遂南適臨安，避金之鋒，然兩國處戰時狀態中，雙方關係尙未定也。先是，汴京吿急時，欽宗為茍安計，與金訂約，金君宋臣，歲納銀絹各若干，謂之貢禮，及高宗即位，金復以包茅見責，高宗初則迫於輿論，勉強議戰，後則專任秦檜，力主和議，是知紹興之前期，宋金尙為　國，和議既定，　渝為君臣關係矣。史載，王倫率金使歸以詔諭江南為名，謂宋一屈膝，則太后可復，梓宮可還，淵聖可歸，中原可得，宰相秦檜孫近以下，翕然和之，凡阻和議者，先則殺岳飛，　張浚，再則廢趙鼎，貶胡銓，一時輿論統一，若捨示和外再無外交可循者</p>
<p>孝宗立慨然以恢復自任，以虞允文劉錡為相，與金連虞，然綿為所敗，時金主世宗號稱賢君，故雙方無隙可乘，因罷兵議和，宋為侄，金為叔，廢君臣之禮，以與國相見，時論譽為中興，光宗繼立，宴兵無事，與孝宗同</p>
<p>寧宗時，主虞派復活，韓侂胄為相，好大喜功，思以軍威自見，因請追封岳飛，詔貶秦檜，力詆和議之失，寧宗初，乃有伐金之師，侂胄自為太師平原郡王平章軍國事，一時愛國志士如辛棄疾等，均倡聲和之，惜侂胄志大才疏，不學無術，致師出出無功，反罹慘敗，宋人斬侂胄頭　送金師，約以伯侄之禮，由是宋兵力益衰，金亦疲於奔命，為日後元人建國張本。</p>
<p>總上四朝之外交政策，均不足取，戰旣無功，和亦辱國，尤以高宗屈膝稱臣為甚，蓋南宋初年，多　意氣，氣盛時則摩拳擦掌，氣脮時則匐匍示憐，對於國家之大計，外交之正軌，皆置不問，惟孝宗朝，「戰而求和」，較為穩妥之策，惜所遇非時，未能逞志為可惜耳。</p>
<p>今日外交局面，自較南宋為裑雜，操此外交輪舵者，尤非一二大員所能藏事，况處於兩大之間，常有事齊事楚之感，一步不當，極易招　不測之禍，然則當如之何？吾意外交自為外交，內政自為內政，二者不必影響，蓋非常時期，舉措間亦應非常也。</p>
<h3>錫克族人的抗議</h3>
<p>— 榮觀</p>
<p>勾踐打了敗仗，為了忍辱負重，不惜以國主之尊，卑躬曲節，奉承吳王。一面臥薪嘗膽，十年生聚，十年敎訓。結果裑仇雪恥，替後世多難興邦哀師示勝立下一個殷鑒。</p>
<p>時至今日，別的民族也從歷史得了敎訓，曉得這個訣竅，如印度在爭取獨立中，一部份民族極力主張分治，但更大多數是痛苦地迎候着這分裂的日子到來，就在這印回分治日趨實現的時候，電訊傳出了近乎臥薪嘗膽可歌可泣的訊息：</p>
<p>〔中央三日新德里電〕：印度錫克族及印度敎大會人士三日實行罷工抗議分治，錫克族人民似更不愉快，蓋彼等幾在兩國間被均分也。彼等之領袖指示以傳統方式紀念此反對分治日，故令其　均勿點燈，勿睡於床上，勿用金屬器皿，勿於桌上進餐，彼等復以稻草置於床上，或以樹葉置於碟下，其間懐勿忘國家分割之痛苦。</p>
<p>藝上最明白分割的痛苦的，莫過於波蘭民族了。波蘭痛遭三次分割二次亡國之禍，國而不幸，誰不　史而為之唏噓！但錫克族能在分治之前預知分割的痛苦，含辛茹苦，謀所以避免或抗議之方，上下一心，只要堅持到底，像波蘭一樣，仍不失其完成的一日的。</p>
<h3>十二個月命名的起源</h3>
<p>— 西風</p>
<p>你知道了「一週七天命名的起源」後，一定也很想知道十二個月命名的起源吧，現在讓我再來作一簡單的介紹：</p>
<p>一月January：就是神Janus的月，他生着兩個頭，一頭瞻前，一頭顧後，是一個「開端和終結」的神。一月是新年的開端，舊年的終結。從前種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生；舊的從此湮滅，新的自今萌芽。以Janus來命名一年的開始，是再也適宜汪過了。Janus在天庭的職司是守門，所以人們也聘他兼了「門神」的差事。</p>
<p>二月February：是由Februa而來的。這是羅馬在這月舉行的一種祭典，這種「淸凈之祭」是為祭魯貝爾克斯神所特設。February本是居最末位的月份。至耶穌紀元前四百五十年時，才改居二月的位置。後來又曾一度變動，現在　然回復了，但二月却仍是一　不安定的月份，平年廿八日，閏年廿九日，每隔四年。加上一日。</p>
<p>三月March：為戰神Mars馬斯的月。他常以「恐怖「「驚矛，一手執盾。古代羅馬人每逢起兵出征。事前總奉承神前卜個吉凶。由主師愼重地獻上一匹囚在籠裏的雛形小鳥，然後以一穗新穀，試於鳥前若穀粒被啄食了，則認為此戰必勝，即刻誓師出發；否則就旗偃鼓息了。馬斯又被奉為「萬能之神」，古羅馬的善男信女們，幾至一舉一動都取決於他，以他的意志為意志。</p>
<p>四月April：是一個優雅聰穎，溫和親切的安琪兒Angel。她追隨着馬斯的血漬斑斑腥膻撲鼻的車轍，散播着喜悅的和平的種子。小草透露着頭，快樂之淚迷糊了兩眼，花苞也嬌羞地笑了。大地揚溢着喜氣，萬物都在孕育滋長。April本為Opener之意，事實上四月也的確是「開展之月」。</p>
<p>五月May：是女神　亞Maia之月。她就是肩負地球的大力神奧塔拉斯的七個女兒之一。又是「商業之神」麥考萊的母親。羅馬主神將她七姊妹組成一個普來亞代斯星座。她是七星中最慘淡的一顆。因為她為着丈夫西富士被神罰作搬運巨石的苦工，終日上下於大山嶺。以致神色沮喪，鬱悶不樂。</p>
<p>六月Jane：為崇拜女神Juno之月，也有說是紀念羅馬　族Junius的。前者是邱比特的嬌妻，常乘着孔雀輓引的　　，悠游天宮。而後者則為一艷麗善妒的大家閨秀。</p>
<p>七月July：提起Julius　Gaesar凱撒的大名，幾乎是盡人皆知的。他不但是一英勇善虎的豪傑，也是一位博學多能的俊才。改法律，廢舊曆，將舊曆以三月為年首而居第五位的七月，昆特里斯改以己名July命名，因為他是出生於是月的。</p>
<p>八月August。奧加斯脫Augustus原名是奧加塔威斯，為凱撒之外甥，他和安特尼，來比茨斯三人支配着羅馬。後來做了皇帝，才改名Augustus，這是「尊嚴」的意思。八月是他最有功績的月份，他結束了戰爭，奠下了和平，羅馬黃金時代也就此發　，在史上寫下了燦爛的一頁。羅馬人為紀念他的豐功偉績，就以他的名字命名八月了。並且為了免除妒忌，特將九月移一日與八月，使與凱撒的七月，同樣有三十一天。</p>
<p>羅馬人覺得在奧加斯特之後，更無偉人，足以命名所餘月份了。所以八月之後的月名一槪照舊。因舊曆惟三月為年首，September，October，November，December原為七，八，九，十月的意義，而現在却照新曆而表示九月，十月，十一月，十二月了。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐茲園</p>
<p>麗莎畫寓一宵</p>
<p>在曉市頓作家協會內，認識了許多作家詩家和畫家，她們提起一位當地頗有名望的畫家麗莎Liza，麗莎曾留法意等國從名師習繪事，造詣頗深，但返美後曲高和寡，其藝不售，現已改變作風專在生意眼上着想，繪事甚忙，供不應求，我很願意認識這位藝術家，約定了一個日子，伴同作家協會同人驅車往其寓所，平房一座，有客廳，餐廳，臥室，廚房，浴室，佈置甚精，麗莎已三十許人，貎亦平平，但吐屬極腻，如十六歲小姑娘，遍宅未見其畫室，詢知畫室設於汽車間內，麗莎為治晚膳，食畢索觀作品，持不可，索益急，乃　　出巨帙以示，揭這則赫然藝術叛徒之作品也，畫非手繪而係木刻所印，據麗莎云係取法於中國古時森刻，顧所用非木板而為橡皮地　，其聰明可知，將所刻人像印於手巾及茶巾上，然後敷色及題詩，名皆冶艷而有雙關意。例如I　don't　mean　Private，I　mean　a　little　privacy，則圖一裸體少女，正與一等兵Private　1st　class打電話也。又如Brigadier-general's　hot　srff均屬活色生香。此項手帕及茶巾以銷於好萊塢及歡塲女子者為多，蔴紗者每打十八元起，綢質者每打二十四元起，麗莎售畫所得，月入千金，生活裕如，顧居處無郞，未免缺憾。臨行承貽手帕一方，視之則赫然Brigadier-general之hot　stuff也。　（可譯作准將的心上人）（十六）</p>
<h3>陳娟在「春之夢」中</h3>
<h3>二海記</h3>
<p>— 美國B·巴頓作　許天虹譯</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦有兩個海。</p>
<p>一個是淡水的，其中有魚，飛濺的葱　裝飾着它的岸邊，樹木散佈椏枝於其上，伸出它們的乾　的根，去吮　它那些會治病的水。</p>
<p>沿着它的水濱，兒童們玩耍着，正如「他」（耶穌基督）在那邊時一般。「他」愛它。當「他」講他的寓言時，「他」可以越過它那銀色的水而望開去。在距離不遠的一片起伏的平原上，「他」以兩　魚和幾塊麵包　飽過五千個人。</p>
<p>「約但河」以來自山間的璀燦的水造成了這個海。人們在它附近造了房子，鳥築了它們的巢；一切的有生之物，都因它在那兒而更快樂。</p>
<p>「約但河」繼續南流，流入了另一個海。</p>
<p>這兒沒有魚的潑　，沒有翩僊的樹葉，沒有鳥的歌聲，沒有兒童的笑聲。除非有緊急的事幹，旅行者都不願走過這兒。空氣沉重地籠罩在它的水上，無論人或禽獸都不去喝它。</p>
<p>什麽東西使得這兩只鄰接的海有這麼大的不同呢？</p>
<p>不是約但河—它以同樣的好水注入它倆，不是它們躺在那裏的土壤；也不是它們周圍的地方。</p>
<p>不同的在這一點，「加黎利海」接受了約但河，但並不留住它。有一滴流進去，就有另一滴流出來。</p>
<p>其他一個海比較狡黠，嫉妬地囤積着它收入的東西。</p>
<p>它不會被誘發一點慷慨的衝動。它得到的每一滴，它都保留着。</p>
<p>「加黎利海」有所予，所以它活着。其他那一個，什麽也不給。它名呌「死」海。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦有兩個海。</p>
<p>世界上有兩種人。</p>
<h3>趙松雪夫婦</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>趙孟頫字子昂，號松雪道人，湖州人，本為宋之宗室，降於元，官翰林學士承旨，故又稱趙承旨，書法褚米，尤工行楷，今人所臨之「趙貼」，即孟頫之傑作也。此公雖係一文化漢奸，然平生風流瀟洒，工詩善詞，堪稱元代一大家，娶婦管仲姬，世稱管夫人，畫墨竹蘭梅，筆意淸絕，書牘行楷，殆與松雪不辨，衛夫人而後，世無　者。按元史所載，松雪夫婦間之韻事，頗多　頤處，初，二人情感極篤，後仲姬色衰，松雪頗有納寵之意，乃試以長短句投這，曰：「我為學士，爾作夫人，豈不聞王學士有桃葉桃根，蘇學士有朝雲暮雲，我便多娶幾個越女吳姬無過分，爾年紀已過四旬，只管佔住玉堂春！」仲姬得句，亦以諧詞報之，曰：「爾儂我儂，忒煞情多，情多處熱似火，把一塊泥觀一個你，揑一個我，將咱兩個一齊打破，用水調和，再塑一個你，再揑一個我，我泥中有你，你泥中有我，我與你生同一個衾，死同一個　。」松雪感莫多情，　罷納妾之想。昔文君私奔相如，晚年相如亦欲再娶，文君作白頭吟示意，可見「痴心女人負心漢」，千古如出一轍，某雖非女流。甞為婦女界呌屈不已。</p>

<h3>National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Members' Election Dates Decided Separately; Voting in Late October and December</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The third committee meeting of the General Election Office was held at 3:00 PM on the 10th. Chairman Zhang Lisheng presided over the meeting, and the following important matters were discussed and approved: (1) Decided on the format of the nomination and signature forms for candidates for National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members. (2) Decided that the General Election Office will draft general rules for the meetings of the election committees of district-level election offices, which will be submitted to the meeting for approval and then promulgated. (3) Decided that voting for National Assembly representatives will be held on October 21st, 22nd, and 23rd (three days), and voting for Legislative Yuan members will be held on December 21st, 22nd, and 23rd (three days). Other opinions related to election affairs were also widely exchanged.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is reported that the election date for Legislative Yuan members has been set for December 21st to 23rd. According to Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law, incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the election district under their jurisdiction or where their office is located should resign five months before the election period. Therefore, all incumbent officials who are running for Legislative Yuan membership in their jurisdiction or where their office is located should resign before July 20th. However, given that the election date is approaching rapidly, and to ensure that restricted officials can participate in the election, it has been clarified that the resignation date will be calculated from the date the resignation letter is submitted. The date of submission of the resignation letter must be communicated by the official's superior in the name of the organization to the competent election office via telegram. If the resignation is rejected with persuasion to stay, the date of the resubmitted resignation letter will be used for calculation. If the date of the resubmitted resignation letter is later than July 20th, the resignation will be invalid. The Judicial Yuan has clarified that the scope of officials refers to civil officials above the rank of appointee and military officials above the rank of second lieutenant. The office has clarified that the "election district where the office is located" refers to "the election district where the government office is located." For example, if Zhenjiang County is one of the election districts for Legislative Yuan members in Jiangsu Province and is also the location of the provincial and county governments, then all restricted officials who have not resigned will not be eligible to be elected as Legislative Yuan members in the Zhenjiang election district. Furthermore, the office has also clarified that the "election district of jurisdiction" refers to "the area of jurisdiction, whether partially or wholly included within the scope of an election district, must resign according to law before participating in the election in that election district." For example, if an administrative inspectorate district governs six counties, and these six counties belong to two or more Legislative Yuan member election districts, then the restricted officials of this inspectorate must resign before competing in these multiple election districts.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Assembly Representatives Friendship Association held its 17th executive committee meeting at 9:00 AM on the 10th in the conference room on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. More than 60 people attended, chaired by Liang Xanda. Ding Xuanxiao and Wang Zemin first reported on recent work, and a number of important proposals were discussed. Many expressed dissatisfaction with the rumored "2-1-1-1" allocation method for the election ratio quotas negotiated between the central government and political parties, and representatives were appointed to draft a written proposal to the central government expressing opposition. Subsequently, they unanimously supported the government's issuance of a mobilization order.</p>
<h3>Chief of General Staff Chen Arrives in Beiping from Nanjing; Resolves Logistics Problems in Northeast and North China; Will Go to Shenyang in the Coming Days to Represent the Chairman in慰勞the Troops</h3>

Chen told our newspaper reporter at the airport that he wanted to visit the Northeast after a brief stay in Beiping. When a reporter asked for his thoughts on the Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion Order, Chen replied, "I was just about to ask for your thoughts." It is reported that Chen will stay in Beiping for one or two days and then go to Shenyang, where he will stay longer in the Northeast. The main purpose of Chen's trip is to resolve the logistics problems of the National Army in the Northeast and North China. Therefore, in addition to the Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, Guo Chi, the accompanying personnel also include senior officials from the General Affairs Management, Communications, Military Medicine, Finance, Transportation, and Ordnance departments of the Joint Logistics Headquarters.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] Chen Cheng and Guo Chan came to the north to thoroughly reorganize the logistics work in the Northeast and North China, and to plan for the transportation of wounded soldiers from the Northeast to Beiping, while wounded soldiers in this area will be transported to Shanghai. Chief of General Staff Chen brought many慰勞items such as Nanjing salted ducks. It is said that after Chen arrives in Shenyang, he will represent the Chairman in慰勞ing meritorious generals, officers, and soldiers such as Chen Mingren.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits in Northern Shaanxi Enter Suiyuan; Four Townships in Chicheng, Chahar Province, Are Also Disturbed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui绥, 10th] Communist bandits from northern Shaanxi have moved north, entering Otog Banner from Sanduan 土. Yang Sen扎布 telegraphed the province to report the emergency.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 10th] Communist bandits in four townships in Chicheng are carrying out bloody struggles. Those with more than 30 acres of land are first struggled against and then killed. The people are terrified and are fleeing to Longguan. More than 200 men, women, and children are hoping that the National Army will send troops to rescue them from the abyss of suffering. Furthermore, according to refugees who recently fled from Hequ, the communist bandits recently held an emergency meeting and decided to launch a fundraising campaign. Wealthy households and those who have made money by joining the Trade Bureau's "turn over" team must donate large amounts of money. If they disobey in the slightest, they will be severely tortured and treated as national special stubborn elements and sentenced to death, with their property confiscated. The communist bandits also instructed their cadres that "now is the time to kill people. If the bourgeoisie does not wake up, they can only be awakened with a knife." Currently, the people in the communist-controlled areas who have a few acres of meager land are unable to survive and are fleeing to our area. Everyone who hears about this is filled with righteous indignation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 10th] At 3:00 AM on the 10th, the Communist Independent Regiment and three county brigades from Yanqing and other counties, totaling more than 1,100 people, suddenly besieged Da Xiaobailao, which is about ten li northwest of our Yongning City. Although our self-defense force only had more than 30 people, they were able to use small but strong stronghold fortifications to resist bravely. After an hour of fierce fighting, the communist bandits were unable to succeed. A certain regiment of the National Army received the news and dispatched a battalion to quickly provide support. At 4:00 AM, they arrived and coordinated with our self-defense force, launching a pincer attack on the bandits from both inside and outside. After two hours, at dawn, the entire bandit force was defeated. It is estimated that the bandits left behind 100 corpses, and hundreds were wounded. More than 90 prisoners were captured, and three light machine guns and 50 or 60 rifles were seized. Our self-defense force suffered less than ten casualties.</p>
<h3>Repairs to the Beiping-Baoding Line Are Underway; Through Traffic Will Still Take a Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] After being severely disrupted by the communist bandits this time, the railway on the Beiping-Baoding line was once again severely damaged. The losses in Xushui and Zaohe were particularly heavy, with an estimated loss of 1,640 rails and damage to 68,000 sleepers. Other track components were damaged for about 40 kilometers. The repairs will take time. In addition to sending a telegram to the Ministry of Transportation requesting the allocation of materials, the Pinghan Railway Bureau has now begun repairs. Repairs have now reached 103 kilometers. It is estimated that through traffic on the entire line will take about a month. Furthermore, the largest railway bridge at Beihedian between Beiping and Baoding has been repaired, and passenger trains are now running to Beihedian.</p>
<h3>China Repays the Principal and Interest on Lend-Lease Materials from the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] The U.S. State Department announced on the morning of the 9th that it had received a check from the Chinese Supply Commission in Washington for US$2,820,020.32 to pay the principal and interest due on July 1, 1947, under the terms of the "Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of China Concerning the Disposition of Lend-Lease Supplies in Agreed Inventories Acquired in the United States" of June 14, 1946. The State Department's statement was issued by the newly appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Armer, and stated that US$1,095,020.32 of the aforementioned figure was interest due on July 1, 1947. The total amount officially notified to the Chinese government to date is $46,010,618.75, with an interest rate of 2 and 3/8 percent. As the principal amount increases, the subsidiary amount will also increase. The remaining $1,725,000 of the aforementioned figure is the principal installment due on July 1, 1947. Based on the estimated total debt owed by China under the June 14, 1946, Lend-Lease Oil Pipeline Agreement, which is $51.75 million, the above number accounts for approximately 1/30th of it.</p>
<h3>The Council of State Affairs Residents Committee Will Hold a Regular Meeting This Morning; Huang Yanpei Arrives in Nanjing from Shanghai to Attend</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Council of State Affairs Residents Committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Bai Chongxi will attend to report on military affairs and discuss proposals, including those for increasing the salaries of officers and soldiers.</p>

<h3>Leng Xin Discusses the Mobilization Plan; Relies on Cooperation Between the People and the Government</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Local News] General Leng Xin told reporters yesterday that the State Council's recent passage of the General Mobilization Plan is sufficient to boost public morale and strengthen the suppression of communist bandits and shorten the war time. However, the thorough implementation of general mobilization relies on close cooperation between the people and the government. Leng was unwilling to predict when the war to suppress the communist bandits would be concluded. He said that sometimes it is for pure scientists, sometimes it is for non-scientists, so prediction is difficult to be reliable. Leng is scheduled to return to Nanjing in a day or two. He denied the news that he would succeed Li Mo'an as the Pacification Commander of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Gao Shuxun's Troops in Southeastern Shanxi Clashed Fiercely with the Main Force of the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th] Gao Shuxun's troops in southeastern Shanxi, who are holding up the banner of the Chinese Communist Party, are on the verge of clashing fiercely with the main force of the communist bandits. Gao's troops have withdrawn all units east of Dongyangguan westward, and the main force is concentrated in the Changzhi, Lucheng, Licheng, and Nangyuan areas. It is reported that Gao himself is currently stationed in the strongholds of Beijiaoshan City and Nanwulongshan, northeast of Changzhi City, and is currently strengthening fortifications. According to military sources, Liu Bocheng recently ordered Qin Jiwei, commander of the Communist Taihang Military Region, and Chen Geng, commander of the Fourth Column, to eliminate Gao's troops within a limited time. Chen's main force arrived in Xihuozhen (southeast of Changzhi), and Qin's bandits occupied Dongyangguan (east of Licheng). In addition, more than 10,000 people bearing the designation "New Fourth Army" advanced from northern Henan through Licheng towards Nangyuan, taking an encirclement posture against Gao's troops. Currently, Gao's troops have confiscated all communist bandit trade bureaus, cooperatives, public-run stores, and other production institutions in their controlled areas. Militiamen are uniformly disarmed. On the one hand, they are extensively recruiting people who have been subjected to liquidation and are dissatisfied with the communist bandits' brutal behavior. Many people are joining the ranks.</p>
<h3>Buildings in Chairman's Hometown; Zhejiang Provincial Government Raises Funds for Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, *Date Omitted*] The former residence of Chairman Chiang in Xikou, Fenghua, originally had the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the Chiang Kai-shek Library, and the Danyou Villa, which were precious buildings. Unfortunately, they were destroyed during the Japanese occupation and are now incomplete. When the Chairman returned to his hometown this spring, he also expressed his regret for this. It was decided to rebuild them. The provincial government decided to join forces with the Hangzhou municipal government and the municipal chamber of commerce to raise 10 million yuan to restore the old appearance.</p>
<h3>Border Demarcation Work Between China and Mongolia; Difficult to Realize in the Short Term; Xinjiang Provincial Assembly Declares Recess</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] There is great expectation from all sides regarding the border demarcation issue between China and Outer Mongolia. Relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Interior have completed various preparatory works. However, this matter must first go through diplomatic channels before it can begin. To date, China and Outer Mongolia have not established diplomatic relations, and there are battles on the border. Therefore, border survey work is difficult to commence in the short term.</p>

<h3>Arrested Communist Personnel in Chongqing Confirmed to Have Solid Evidence After Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Of the 229 reporters, students, and citizens summoned by the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters, most have been released on bail successively. The remaining, after the headquarters' multi-faceted investigation and questioning, are believed to have solid evidence against them. Those who admitted to being underground Communist workers or having close relations with the Communist Party totaled 32 people, who are still being held for questioning and have not been released. A reporter recently met with Commander Sun Yuanliang of the headquarters, who said: "These 32 people detained are all involved in serious circumstances. For example, Zhang Nuhu was the manager and printing factory director of the former 'Democracy Daily,' Li Hongren was the chief writer of the former 'Democracy Daily,' Luo Keting was a professor at the Southwest Academy No. 1, Li Wenzhao was the dean of student affairs at the Southwest Academy, and Zhong Qiuyuan was the manager of the Sanlian Bookstore. Zhou Shikai was the director of the New China Theatre Company. All the above-mentioned people are members of the Chinese Communist Party's External Relations Committee. Their acceptance of Communist Party orders to disrupt social security and order is not tolerated by national law. However, for the sake of caring for young people, if they can change their ways, repent, and start anew, they can also be released at our discretion."</p>
<h3>Beiping Population: 1,680,000</h3>

<h3>China's Agricultural Mechanization; Currently Sprouting and Actively Promoting; Tractor Tillage Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] A certain agricultural expert from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently gave a speech on the improvement of agricultural machinery and its use by farmers, stating: "European and American countries have moved toward rural electrification, while China's agricultural mechanization is still in its initial stage. The achievements of agricultural mechanization in the United States can serve as a model for our country's efforts. In 1929, one-third of the population of the United States was engaged in farming, producing enough food to be self-sufficient. By the end of 1945, not only was food self-sufficient, but also in large surplus, exported abroad, while the number of people engaged in farming was less than one-fifth of the total population. This is entirely the effect of agricultural mechanization. In contrast, more than 70% of farmers in our country still need to rely on others for food. Irrigation tools are urgently needed in China's rice-growing areas. Currently, they are already being used in various locations. In order to promote this, this year, the Ministry has ordered 12-inch water pumps and 25-horsepower cold-start engines from the Wuxi Farm Tool Factory, nine sets each. It has also cooperated with the Farmers Bank of China to pilot the mechanical irrigation loan purchase demonstration project in Danyang and Jintan counties in Jiangsu. If the results are excellent, it will continue to expand the program. The use of tractors can greatly save labor costs. Currently, tractor tillage stations have been established in Weishi and Fugou in the Yellow River flooded area, Shayang in Hubei, Shatang in Guangxi, and Hengyang in Hunan, with excellent results. With the use of tractors, more than 50 mu can be cultivated every day. Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Northeast provinces are also actively preparing to establish these stations. Other machines such as harvesters, threshers, and rice mills are also very commonly used in various parts of our country."</p>
<h3>President Zhang Proposes to the Economic Commission; Hoping for the Strict Implementation of Savings and Consumption; Executive Yuan Discusses Implementation Measures for Mobilization</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] In order to strictly implement the General Mobilization Plan, President Zhang proposed the "Measures for the Strict Implementation of Savings and Consumption" at the sixth meeting of the National Economic Commission held in the afternoon of the 10th. After the proposal was made, President Zhang himself explained it, hoping that all administrative agencies could take the lead in promoting savings and strictly implement them. In addition, all public banquet expenses must be reduced. After the report was completed, the discussion began. Several committee members suggested that the implementation of savings should emphasize both law and morality, and must be seriously implemented to be effective; otherwise, it would become a mere formality, disturbing the public. Some committee members believed that savings and consumption should pay special attention to large cities such as Shanghai. If such cities are allowed to indulge in extravagant and wasteful spending, then even if we loudly call for savings, it will be in vain. After deliberation, it was decided to hand the matter over to Wang Yunwu, Lou Tongsun, Xiao Jie, Pan Xulun, He Haoruo, and others to form a subcommittee with the Ministry of Social Affairs for further discussion, convened by Wang Yunwu. The main points of President Zhang's original proposal are three: (1) saving manpower, (2) saving materials, and (3) saving time. Subsequently, the "Regulations on the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises" was discussed and approved. It is said that the main task of the committee is to supervise and approve the sale price and other works when state-owned enterprises are sold in the future. The committee members are designated by President Zhang. (2) The principle of reducing organizations, which is the report case of the review subcommittee. After the report, it was approved after discussion. The main task is to first conduct spot checks on the organization, personnel, and expenses of each agency. After the results of the investigation are compiled, a specific plan for reduction will be determined. (3) Li Ming proposed the formation of a committee to assist in the handling of enemy and puppet industries in Shanghai. Chen Lifu and others believed that there was no need to set up another agency. Finally, it was decided that the Shanghai Trust Bureau should first report on the handling process before further discussion. Furthermore, the review reports of the financial subcommittee and the food subcommittee of the economic reform plan have not yet been submitted, and were not discussed at today's meeting. After the comprehensive subcommittee compiles the text, it will be submitted to the seventh plenary meeting next week for discussion. Today's meeting began at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, chaired by President Zhang, with committee members such as Chen Lifu and Huang Yuanbin in attendance.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Executive Yuan has scheduled a temporary meeting to be held on the morning of the 11th to discuss the implementation measures for each department of the General Mobilization Order and the mobilization measures for the economic sector, which will be based on the wartime general mobilization guidelines and coordinated with the economic reform plan to cope with both peacetime and emergency periods. Regarding the food sector, the principles have not yet been decided. Senior officials of the Ministry of Food have been in frequent contact with people from all walks of life in recent days, exchanging opinions extensively.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] In order to study how to cooperate with the national mobilization decrees, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established five subcommittees: (1) General Affairs Subcommittee, handling all document matters. (2) Materials Subcommittee, responsible for studying the control of materials such as cotton yarn. (3) Price Subcommittee, responsible for price management and research on improving the treatment of public school teachers and civil servants. (4) Increased Production Subcommittee, responsible for increasing production in industries such as mining. (5) Trade Subcommittee, responsible for promoting domestic and foreign trade. Each subcommittee will separately formulate detailed measures, and then submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>Those Who Purchased a Large Amount of Victory Bonds; The National Government Awards the Medal of Excellent Star; Xu Hailong, Wang Mouqing, and 63 Others</h3>

<h3>Commentary from the Washington Star: Urging the United States to Assist China Promptly; Military Observers Claim the Soviets Are Actively Aiding the CCP</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The Washington Star editorial stated that if the United States does not aid China, communism will inevitably spread throughout the country, which is of great importance to American foreign policy. The severity of the issue is not only related to American policy towards China and the rest of the Far East, but also to America's global policy. With the $500 million loan to China from the Export-Import Bank set aside, the Chinese government's financial situation and American policy towards China have reached a focal point. The American loan to China was originally attached to conditions, namely that Chinese politics must be on the right track. Marshall's mission as a special envoy to mediate the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists for nearly a year was based on this type of agreement. Since Marshall's return to the United States, the situation in China has been deteriorating, with civil war raging in many places and the economy on the verge of chaos. Assuming that China has lost the opportunity to borrow from the United States, the coalition government, if it includes the Communist Party, will inevitably be allowed to do as it pleases, and will ultimately control the overall situation, or it will be difficult to succeed. If so, isn't the American government asking the impossible of President Chiang?</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Several American military observers who went to China for inspection and recently returned to the United States stated that since the withdrawal of American troops from North China, Soviet policy towards China has shifted from passive to active. "Before the withdrawal of American troops, the Communist forces in Northeast China and North China felt a severe shortage of military supplies. As soon as the American troops withdrew, the Communist forces in Northeast China launched an offensive and were equipped with artillery pieces, whereas previously they only had one or two field guns." These American officers believe that the Soviet troops in northern Korea are actively assisting the CCP with equipment and the Korean Communists they have trained.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] Merchant ships from a certain country, the "Gogol", "Disna", "Simoni", and "Kobosev," have recently been traveling between Vladivostok and Shanghai, providing supplies to the Communist forces along the coast.</p>
<p>The Recall of John Carter Vincent to His Home Country Draws Attention; Observers Believe Wedemeyer Will Be Sent to China</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Shanghai] The recent recall of John Carter Vincent, the American Minister-Counselor, to his home country to consult with Secretary of State Marshall has once again sparked speculation as to whether Ambassador Stuart will be replaced. If this matter is under consideration, observers believe that the likely successor would be Lieutenant General Albert Wedemeyer, the former commander of the U.S. forces in the China theater. Wedemeyer was originally scheduled to succeed Major General Hurley as the ambassador to China, but this was not realized because it was feared that this move would hinder the Nationalist-Communist negotiations. The CCP considers Wedemeyer to be pro-government and therefore does not welcome him. The United States had to take the CCP's views into account at that time, but now that the Nationalists and Communists have been openly at war for several months, and there is no hope of resuming peace talks, this point need not be considered any further. Wedemeyer was greatly appreciated by President Chiang during the war in Chongqing, and the two had a close friendship. When Wedemeyer succeeded Lieutenant General Stilwell as the commander of the China theater, he also served as Chief of Staff to the President, and the two sides cooperated seamlessly. The U.S. government recently decided to sell 130 million rounds of rifle ammunition manufactured for China during the war to China, and observers here mostly believe that the U.S. policy of appeasement towards the CCP will come to an end. Dr. Stuart's appointment as ambassador to China was specially recommended by Marshal Marshall, who believed that Stuart was an important assistant in achieving peaceful unification of China, that both the Nationalists and Communists had a good impression of him, and that he was a famous scholar with a deep understanding of Chinese writing. Unexpectedly, Stuart's talents and Marshal Marshall's efforts were ultimately in vain.</p>
<p>Veterans Who Fought in China Organize an Association in the United States</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] American soldiers who fought in China are being led by Albert Wedemeyer, the former commander of the U.S. forces in the China theater, to form an association here to commemorate their relationship with China. The name has not yet been decided. All those who have been stationed in China are eligible to join, and it is planned to hold monthly gatherings to connect emotionally.</p>

<p>[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 10th] The main force of over 100,000 Communist troops in the Yunmengshan area of southern Shandong, in order to avoid being annihilated by the Nationalist forces in one fell swoop, has been divided into a dozen small groups and are breaking through and fleeing into the rear of the Nationalist forces. This is a desperate struggle after the complete loss of the CCP base in Shandong, providing the Nationalist forces with a good opportunity to defeat them individually. The 69th and other columns fled eastward towards Donglidian. Over 10,000 troops from the 8th Column captured Tai'an on the night of the 7th and continued to capture Dawenkou on the afternoon of the 9th.

<h3>Communist Forces Obstruct the Repair of the Yellow River Dike; The Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious; The Hebei Repair and Defense Office Urges Employees to Repair at the Risk of Their Lives</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The work of restoring the Yellow River dike in Hebei Province is being expedited by the Hebei Repair and Defense Office. It is expected that all dangerous projects will be completed before the 10th of this month. However, since the Communist bandits broke their promise and crossed the river to disrupt, the situation has become very serious. The Ministry of Water Resources recently received a report from the office stating that the elevated part of the dike restoration project could not be completed due to the disruption of the Communist forces. If the water level rises sharply, there is a risk of widespread breaches. The situation of the various dangerous projects is also serious. The office has agreed on two emergency rescue measures: (1) In the sections near the Communist-occupied areas, employees should repair at the risk of their lives. (2) Strengthen the transportation of labor and materials. The commissioners and county magistrates have prepared for emergency implementation when necessary.

<h3>Huang Shaohong Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing; Calls for Relief for the Guangxi Flood Disaster; Huang Xuchu Arrives in Shanghai Today and Returns to Guangxi the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper report] Huang Shaohong, Vice President of the Control Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 1:30 p.m. yesterday. According to him, the disaster situation in Guangxi is serious, and this visit is related to disaster relief. He hopes that all sectors of the city will sympathize with the situation.

He is scheduled to fly to Shanghai today.

<p>The Tragic Situation of the Guangxi Disaster</p>
<p>According to Guangxi natives in Shanghai, the people of Guangxi have been suffering from famine and are unable to survive. This summer, they were hit by a major flood. Due to continuous rain last month, mountain torrents broke out, causing rivers to flood. The basins of the West River, Yu River, Yong River, and the left and right rivers, such as Yongning, Heng County, Tiandong, Qianjiang, Teng County, Binyang, Yongchun, and more than 20 other counties and cities, have suffered floods unprecedented in the past 50 years. The cities of Guixian, Wuzhou, and Tengxian were flooded to depths of 10 to 20 feet. Counties further away from the river were flooded by mountain torrents. For example, the area within 30 miles of the Wuming district was turned into a swamp, with water depths reaching 25 feet. In the disaster area, all crops such as rice, corn, peanuts, etc., in more than 500 towns and villages were washed away by the floods, and the harvest is hopeless. As for the loss of human lives, livestock, and property, detailed statistics are not yet available. According to a rough estimate by the provincial government, a total of 56 counties have been affected, with approximately 3 million disaster victims. Emergency relief work is urgently needed. After arriving in Nanjing on the 7th, Chairman Huang repeatedly negotiated and obtained approval for an allocation of 2 billion to provide relief, and a loan of 5 billion from the Four Banks Consortium to purchase grain for relief. Relief from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is also being negotiated, hoping to immediately release the materials stored in Guangxi and request an allocation of 30,000 tons of relief grain, but no final decision has been made. In addition, he requested the central government to allocate 300,000 piculs of grain from Guangxi Province's requisition quota for 1946 for emergency relief, and this matter is being reviewed by the Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the staff accompanying Chairman Huang on this trip to Shanghai include Secretary-General Huang of the Provincial Government, Director Yin Zhi of the Department of Social Affairs, and Consultant Chen Niiren. Huang and his party are scheduled to fly back to Guilin this Sunday.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Chairman Huang Xuchu of Guangxi met with President Chiang at 1:00 p.m. on the 10th to report on the disaster situation in order to seek relief for the Guangxi disaster. Huang is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the morning of the 11th to continue raising funds for disaster relief in Guangxi. Furthermore, the government has decided to allocate 2 billion for disaster relief in Guangxi, but Huang believes that the disaster area is too large and the funds are insufficient, and is still in negotiations.</p>

Building materials do not need to rely on foreign countries, and we should use as much domestic bricks, tiles, and wood as possible."

(2) After a certain period of execution, the person has shown genuine remorse. The traitor Zhou currently has absolutely no reason for bail, and this matter is bound to fail.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Europe Reaches a Critical Juncture of Division and Unity!</h3>
<p>The European Economic Recovery Conference will open on the 12th. The 22 countries of Europe have all received invitations from Britain and France. Whether they should accept the invitation or not must be decided within these few days. As of the time of writing, according to a report from Agence France-Presse, 15 European countries, namely Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Iceland, Italy, Portugal, and Southern Ireland, have successively and formally indicated their acceptance of the invitation to participate in the European Recovery Conference to discuss the U.S. Secretary of State's plan for economic aid to Europe. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have formally refused. The remaining five countries are still carefully considering. Europe's "division" and "unity" have reached a final juncture, and the outcome will be clear within these few days. Therefore, the development of the European political situation in these few days is really worth our close attention. A diplomatic reporter from the Associated Press stated yesterday: "The ideal of 'One World' is on the verge of disillusionment." This statement is not an exaggeration, or perhaps it is intended to be alarmist: Europe's "division" and "unity" have indeed reached a crossroads.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Marshall's plan for aid to Europe was originally the second chapter of the Truman Doctrine, seeking to explore the Soviet Union's true intentions towards Europe through economic aid to European countries' recovery, thereby finding a way out in the gap between the U.S. and Soviet Union's confrontation. However, because Britain and France urgently needed U.S. assistance, upon hearing Secretary of State Marshall's speech at Harvard University, Foreign Secretary Bevin hastily went to Paris to first consult on the common attitude of Britain and France, and then decided to invite Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Paris to hold a three-nation foreign ministers' conference. At that time, although some people doubted whether Foreign Minister Molotov would accept the invitation from the British and French foreign ministers, in the end, Molotov finally arrived in Paris to participate in the three-nation foreign ministers' conference, which greatly excited the general public, who believed that the future of Europe was very optimistic. Unexpectedly, very obvious rifts occurred at the three-nation foreign ministers' conference, namely that the opinions of Britain and France and the Soviet Union's proposals were vastly different, virtually running in opposite directions. The more the three foreign ministers debated, the more divergent their opinions became, and therefore the three-nation foreign ministers' conference broke up in disagreement.</p>
<p>The failure of the three-nation foreign ministers' conference was a great loss for European countries, because European countries suffered war destruction during the war period, their vitality was greatly damaged, and the post-war devastation was everywhere. If they wanted to talk about recovery and prosperity, they had to obtain foreign assistance. Britain and France were in the same situation. Since the United States had expressed its willingness to provide economic assistance, Britain and France could not easily abandon the opportunity for U.S. assistance because of the Soviet Union's opposition. Therefore, Britain and France invited 22 European countries to hold a pan-European conference to jointly discuss methods for implementing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. However, on the Soviet side, since it believed that Britain and France were secretly colluding and attempting to manipulate the Soviet Union, it was unwilling to participate in the European Economic Conference again. The Soviet Union also considered that European countries generally tended to lean towards the Western bloc, and of course it was unwilling for its vassal countries to accept the invitation from Britain and France and participate in the European Economic Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. In addition to exerting slight pressure on Romania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Finland, and other countries politically and diplomatically, it also provided grain aid to Romania to show that the Soviet Union also had the intention and ability to provide economic assistance to other countries, which could give some comfort to its vassal countries. Therefore, under this situation, Europe had no choice but to move towards a path of division.</p>
<p>The development of this situation, no matter from which perspective it is observed, is a pessimistic phenomenon. Although the Soviet Union repeatedly attacked the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe as "interfering in the internal affairs of other countries" and used this as a reason to refuse to participate in the implementation of this plan, we, as third parties, feel impartially that the responsibility for the division of Europe should be borne by the Soviet Union. Because after the United States proposed the plan for aid to Europe, it was deeply afraid of excessively stimulating some European countries, and always remained silent, never clearly stating its position. As for the U.S. aid-to-Europe conditions reported by Agence France-Presse on June 27: (1) Abolishing preferential tariff barriers; (2) Making various commercial agreements multilateral in nature; (3) Treating all countries on an equal basis; (4) Allowing free navigation on European inland waterways, especially the Danube; (5) Realizing the economic unification of Germany; (6) Ratifying and signing peace treaties; (7) Allocating European resources evenly each year; these were just speculations by people in Washington and cannot be regarded as the U.S. government's true attitude. Therefore, Wallace, who has always been pro-Soviet, also wrote an article in his edited New Republic magazine attacking the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the invitation from Britain and France.</p>
<p>In short, Europe has reached a critical juncture of "division" and "unity," and the seriousness of the situation has almost reached an unimaginable stage. It has not been two years since the victorious end of World War II, and yet among the Allied countries, because they cannot trust and accommodate each other, they instead suspect and undermine each other, causing the "One World" that people yearned for during the war to be completely disillusioned, which is really a great tragedy for mankind. However, according to French Foreign Minister Bidault's announcement, the European Conference will not be able to officially begin discussing the U.S. aid-to-Europe plan until the 15th, after its opening on the 12th. According to this, Europe's "division" and "unity" still have five days of room for maneuver. We ultimately hope that the political diplomats of various countries can use their political wisdom in these four or five days to ensure that Europe can unite and not divide, otherwise the future of Europe will not only have no peace to speak of, but also the coexistence of two Europes will be difficult to maintain, and sooner or later it will inevitably lead to another great calamity for mankind.</p>
<h3>Donations to Comfort the Troops</h3>
<p>People's organizations from all walks of life in Shanghai, in order to support the government's promulgation of the General Mobilization Order and to celebrate the great victory of the National Army in Siping Street, had already decided to hold a "Suppress Communism and Build the Nation: Ten Thousand Yuan Comfort the Troops" conference on the 20th of this month. Everything is being actively prepared, and the solicitation committee will also hold a meeting this morning to discuss the specific methods of solicitation.</p>
<p>We believe that the solicitation methods should be as simple as possible, because donating money to comfort the troops is an obligation that the people should fulfill, and it is completely different from ordinary donations. First, the people in the rear can still live a normal life to this day, and they cannot fail to thank the soldiers who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines. If it were not for the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers on the front lines, today's rear would have already become a second Northeast or North China. Not only would the people's property have no guarantee, but the people's lives would also be in danger at any moment. In these few days, we have seen the tragic scene of Siping Street after the battle in Chinese and foreign newspapers. How can we not be moved by such loyal and brave soldiers who defend the country and protect the people? Second, although the amount of solicitation is huge, it can be obtained by using Shanghai's Baojia system, calculating at 10,000 yuan per household, which can yield 700 million yuan; if calculated at 10,000 yuan per person, it can yield 30 to 40 billion yuan. In today's Shanghai, if everyone saves a little in other aspects and donates 10,000 yuan to comfort the troops, it is really an easy task. Third, the people's donation to comfort the troops is an expression of the people's support for the government's mobilization order, and its significance is even greater. Ambassador Stuart said in Beiping: "The effect of the General Mobilization Order will depend on the people's support." We fully agree; the people's voluntary donation to comfort the troops is the best way for the people to express their support for the General Mobilization Order.</p>
<p>Finally, based on the principle of those who have strength contributing strength and those who have money contributing money, we hope that wealthy families in Shanghai will generously donate money!</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Flies to Paris Today, Preparing to Attend the Opening Ceremony of the European Conference; Five Countries: Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and South Yugoslavia Decide to Reject British and French Invitations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 10th] It has just been learned that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to fly to Paris on the afternoon of the 11th, accompanied by the Foreign Office's economic advisor, Helbach. Bevin will stay in France until after the opening of the Paris Economic Conference.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: Hungary has formally refused to participate. After a lengthy meeting, the Hungarian government issued a statement in Budapest saying, "Because not all major powers are participating in this conference, Hungary feels deeply sorry for not attending."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 10th] Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have rejected the invitations from Britain and France and will not participate in the conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, which will be held in Paris this Saturday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Helsinki, 10th] The Finnish Cabinet held a meeting on the 10th for final discussion on the invitation from France. A resolution is expected to be announced on the evening of the 10th. In addition, the Foreign Affairs Committee convened a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 10th to study a secret memorandum on the economic situation of various countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] Of the 22 European countries invited to attend the Paris Conference this Saturday, only Albania and Finland have not yet responded by today, the deadline for submitting replies. The remaining 15 have already accepted, and 5 have refused. The five countries that have definitely refused are Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Hungary. Yugoslavia's note expressing its refusal to accept the invitation criticized the proposed aid-to-Europe plan, saying that it would allow some countries to threaten the economic life and independence of other countries. Poland's note stated that the interests of small countries cannot be guaranteed, and judging from the conditions of the invitation, any proposed amendments or other amendments to the proposed establishment of the institution have already been preemptively rejected. Romania's decision to refuse did not state the reasons. The most recent statements of acceptance were made by Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, which decided to accept after the foreign ministers of the three countries met in Copenhagen. The 15 countries that have already accepted are Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Southern Ireland, Greece, the Netherlands, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 10th Broadcast: The Soviet official news agency TASS accused British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault of willingly being used by the United States to achieve the goal of forming a European group of countries to isolate the Soviet Union. The above telegram was published in prominent positions in Soviet newspapers and is the most blatant criticism of the Marshall Plan for economic aid to Europe by Soviet newspapers. The agency also accused the U.S., Britain, and France of attempting to win over western Germany to join the group.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 10th] French Foreign Minister Bidault told the French National Assembly that the first three days of the Paris Conference will be devoted to debating the conference's organizational law. Substantive discussions will begin on Tuesday. Bidault explained that Germany will not have representatives participating during the conference. Later, the military governors of the British, American, and French occupied zones may discuss this issue.</p>
<h3>Poland's Refusal to Participate in the European Conference is Due to Soviet Pressure, According to U.S. State Department Officials</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] U.S. officials believe that Poland's refusal to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan is due to Soviet pressure. The State Department stated that the Polish Embassy had declared its support for the Marshall Plan two weeks ago, and that Poland would greatly benefit from participating in European recovery. The sudden change of decision is disappointing. Poland had requested U.S. aid. Now that it has decided to refuse to participate in the Paris Conference, such a request inevitably loses its force. At the same time, the authorities here express their increased respect for Czechoslovakia's decision to participate. It is still unknown whether the Soviet Union will use the same pressure on Czechoslovakia. In the future, the Soviet Union may forcibly revise Czechoslovakia's election law and other restrictive laws to allow the Communist Party to gain more influence in the Czech government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Czech Ambassador to the U.S., Salavik, said that Czechoslovakia's decision to participate in the Paris Conference can end the "speculation about the Iron Curtain." He said that he had never doubted that Czechoslovakia would attend the Paris Conference.</p>
<h3>United Nations Requests to Be Informed of the Progress of the European Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 9th] Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, Beardsley, said here today: The United Nations has not been invited to send observers to the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan, but he has urged Britain to allow the United Nations to be informed of the entire progress of the conference. Beardsley is acting in his position while Lie is traveling to Norway. He also reiterated Lie's hope that the Soviet Union's rejection of the Marshall Plan is not its final statement on the issue.</p>
<h3>Czech Delegation Arrives in Soviet Union, Soviet Foreign Minister Welcomes Them in Person</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk led a Czech delegation to visit the Soviet Union and arrived here this afternoon. Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky personally welcomed them at the airport. In addition, a Czech trade delegation led by Minister of Justice Traina has also arrived in Moscow.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Should Not Refuse to Participate in the European Economic Conference, Wallace Expresses His Views</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 9th] Wallace wrote an article in the current issue of "New Republic Magazine" stating: The Soviet Union should accept the opportunity given by the Paris Conference. Its failure to do so will cause the Marshall Plan to create a serious crisis of world division. This conference is the first meeting to strive for the free world. Although it has failed, it is not a complete loss. From the perspective of an internationalist, we should criticize the Truman Doctrine of providing military aid to anti-Soviet governments, but we agree in principle with the plan proposed by Marshall. By providing economic aid to various countries and cooperating to rebuild the world, Congress holds the key to world peace. If the Republican Party fears the socialist development of Europe, the Marshall Plan will not achieve good results and will instead lead to bad consequences. If it is thought that the United States does not obtain sufficient support in the United Nations Conference to subdue the Soviet Union and therefore wants to reduce the tasks of the United Nations Economic Commission and wants to promote the Marshall Plan, it will ultimately fail. But I believe that the Soviet Union should accept the opportunity given by the Paris Conference, because if the Soviet Union does not participate, the result of promoting the Marshall Plan will lead to a crisis of world division. If the philosophy of the Truman Doctrine is not abolished, the world will form a divided situation and will ultimately fail. This philosophy is only to form a Western European group and make Germany a fortress against the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Suspicion is an Obstacle to Peaceful Understanding, Eleanor Roosevelt Analyzes the Soviet Attitude</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Eleanor Roosevelt said in her daily column today: The Soviet Union's suspicion is a real obstacle to peaceful understanding. When answering why the Soviet Union did not participate in all activities of the United Nations, she quoted the former President as saying: One of the reasons is that the Soviet Union needs the best talents to engage in domestic construction, so the Soviet Union chooses good talents in this area instead of selecting qualified talents to serve in various United Nations activities? Regarding why the Soviet Union believes that other countries must fully accept its plan and cannot make any modifications to achieve cooperation, Mrs. Roosevelt replied: For many years, the Soviet Union has been isolated by other countries, so the Soviet Union often has suspicions when contacting other countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] An article published in this month's Foreign Affairs Quarterly by a person signing as "Mr. X" represents the views of the highest authority. It is said that the United States must treat the Soviet Union as a "fierce enemy rather than a partner" for many years. If the Soviet Union can be suppressed in this way for ten years or more, the result will either be to make it adopt a more cooperative attitude or to weaken its power. Foreign affairs officials believe that this view reflects the ideas of George Kennan, director of the Policy Planning Staff of Secretary of State Marshall. The argument of this article is that the Soviet authorities hope and expect that the capitalist world will eventually collapse. At this moment, Soviet leaders are taking the opportunity to promote the "threat of capitalist encirclement" domestically and are expanding their influence everywhere abroad towards weak countries to protect their own dictatorship. The only key is that Soviet actions do not have a timetable. Their advance and retreat completely depend on the strength of the opposing forces. Strategically speaking, the Soviet Union cannot always wait and achieve nothing. If the United States can plan for this weakness, unite with other Western countries, adopt a policy of fortified walls and clear fields, and monitor it, then in ten or fifteen years, Soviet power will either soften or break.</p>
<h3>Soviet Debt to the U.S.: Interest Repayment</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] The State Department announced that the Soviet government has repaid interest of $4.17 million in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<h3>Security Council Continues to Discuss the Balkan Dispute, U.S. Rejects Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] According to reliable sources: France and Colombia have proposed a compromise plan to reconcile the opinions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union on resolving the Balkan dispute. The U.S. delegation has rejected it and still insists on establishing a semi-permanent investigation team to curb the Greek border dispute and believes that it can obtain the statutory majority of seven votes in the Security Council, leaving the Soviet Union as the only weapon to obstruct it with its veto power.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Approves Army, Navy, and Air Force Merger Bill, Recommends Command by Secretary of Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Senate today approved a compromise bill for the permanent merger of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This bill was drafted at the repeated request of President Truman for two years and has now been sent to the House of Representatives for discussion. Republican leaders in that House believe it must be passed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The Senate passed a bill by voice vote on the 10th to appoint one Secretary of Defense to command the nation's armed forces.</p>
<h3>Britain Hopes to Establish a Peacetime Lend-Lease Agreement with the United States to Avoid Economic Collapse</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] The British government may seek to establish a peacetime lend-lease agreement with the United States to avoid economic collapse. Deputy Prime Minister Morrison and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton made explicit statements in the House of Commons last night, saying that the U.S. loan of $3.75 billion to Britain is being rapidly depleted. At the current rate, it will be exhausted by late winter. Morrison also said: "The only remedy is to bring in goods worth billions of dollars from North and South America to supply aid, without immediately shipping equivalent goods from Europe in exchange. Britain currently owes an average of £450 million per year to pay for food and raw materials, maintain scarce rations, and ease the recovering industries. After the U.S. provides assistance again, our production and living standards will be greatly adjusted. We cannot enter into trade without limit that cannot be paid for." The newspapers this morning are all studying the government's policy, only the Labour Party's "Daily Herald" is silent.</p>
<h3>US Wheat Exports: Expected Participation This Year, To Be a Major Part of the Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The International Food Conference opened here today, attended by representatives from forty-two countries. After a welcoming address by French Prime Minister Ramadier, French Minister of Agriculture Plihon was unanimously elected as Chairman of the Conference. The US representative, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, stated in his speech: "The annual grain movement has begun. The United States will be able to make concrete contributions to world grain import and export trade in the future. However, the grain shortage is unlikely to improve significantly before next spring. It is estimated that the US wheat harvest this year will be 1.4 billion bushels, so its wheat exports may be slightly more than last year. The US currently has more stored corn than last year, but the autumn harvest of corn, barley, and oats may be inferior to last year. Therefore, although the wheat harvest will increase, the total grain harvest may be less than last year. I am pleased to announce that the amount of wheat will be increased among the grains that the United States should export this year. In short, increasing food production, especially grain production, is undoubtedly a major part of the Marshall Plan for European aid. Europe should immediately start to achieve its results."</p>
<h3>US Senate Bipartisan Group Proposes Strengthening UN Institutions, Advocates Granting Power to Prevent War</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The United States yesterday proposed three resolutions aimed at giving the United Nations institutions strong arms to start anew. If the Soviet Union obstructs progress, there is a sincerity to discard it. According to ten Democratic and Republican members of the House of Representatives, convening a new charter conference of the United Nations and empowering the United Nations institutions with the power to enforce world law and prevent war is the most reliable way to determine whether the Soviet Union is determined to conquer the world. Ten Democratic and Republican senators have proposed that President Truman convene a meeting to reorganize the United Nations institutions and amend the Charter to enhance its power to uphold world peace, which can proceed without the addition of the Soviet Union. One of the proposers, together with two other senators, has also proposed a bill to authorize the United Nations institutions to formulate, interpret, and enforce laws to maintain world peace.</p>
<p>The resolution proposed in the House of Representatives has the same content, advocating that Congress urge the President to take the initiative to convene the United Nations General Assembly in accordance with the provisions of the Charter, so that the organization can formulate, interpret, and enforce world laws to prevent war. According to their statement, "The proposers believe that the most reliable way to determine whether the Soviet Union is determined to conquer the world is to find out whether the Soviet Union is willing to jointly create a United Nations organization with other countries that can guarantee its security. Two years of experience have convinced the members of the United Nations that if the United Nations organization is to maintain world peace, its strength must be enhanced. The proposers believe that the direct actions of the United States to aid Greece, Turkey, and the European recovery have made it clear that the United Nations organization in its current form is insufficient to cope with the major pressure of this divided world. As for the United States' unwillingness to hand over the power of international control of atomic energy to the Security Council, it can be left unsaid for the time being. At the same time, during the debate on the aid to Greece and Turkey, it has been proven that not only the general opinion of members of Congress believes that the United Nations organization is our only hope for peace, but there is also a very strong advocacy in favor of strengthening the United Nations organization so that it can perform its tasks." According to Article 109 of the Charter, a Constitutional Conference can be convened with the consent of two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly plus any seven members of the Security Council. However, the Charter cannot be amended without the unanimous consent of all five permanent members of the Security Council, namely the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and China. At Lake Success, United Nations officials claim that any major revisions to the United Nations Charter at this time may cause the breakup of the world organization. A United Nations official commented on the proposal in the US Congress, saying that "there is absolutely no chance of amending the Charter under the current circumstances. Any serious action by the United States may lead to the demise of the United Nations organization."</p>

<p>[Our newspaper] London, 10th Radio: Princess Elizabeth, accompanied by Philip Mountbatten, attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] King George VI announced tonight his consent to the marriage of the heir to the British throne, Princess Elizabeth, to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, the Princess is twenty-one years old, and the Lieutenant is the former Prince Philip of Greece. The Court Circular issued by Buckingham Palace tonight reads: "The King and Queen announce with great pleasure the betrothal of their beloved daughter, Princess Elizabeth, to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten of the Royal Navy (son of the late Prince Andrew of Greece). The King has been pleased to give his consent to the marriage." The date of the wedding has not yet been determined, but according to authoritative sources tonight, the wedding is likely to be held before next spring. Princess Elizabeth's marriage must comply with the provisions of the Royal Marriages Act of 1772. The King's consent to the marriage is based on the provisions of the Act. The holding of the wedding is also subject to the King's approval. At that time, the Privy Council will convene a special meeting and invite representatives of the Empire, Parliament, and leaders of the opposition party, as well as heads of the church, to attend. The King will formally approve the Princess's wedding. The King's consent to the marriage has been notified to Prime Minister Attlee and the Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Southern Rhodesia. Congratulatory messages have been pouring in from all parts of the British Commonwealth, but Buckingham Palace did not hold a ceremony tonight. A garden party may be held at the palace tomorrow afternoon, at which both the Princess and Lieutenant Mountbatten will participate.</p>
<p>Handling Procedures in Accordance with the Constitution</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] After the betrothal of Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten, the following steps will be taken in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution: (1) Prime Minister Attlee will formally announce the Princess's marriage to the members of the House of Commons, and a similar announcement will be made in the House of Lords. (2) Both houses will pass resolutions approving the Princess's marriage and expressing congratulations. The holding of the wedding does not need to be approved by Parliament again.

The annual salary is 60 pounds when the Princess is a minor, and it will increase to 15,000 pounds after she reaches adulthood. It is expected to increase to 60,000 pounds after marriage, but the exact amount must be passed by Parliament in a special bill. (4) Lieutenant Mountbatten is expected to be awarded the highest rank of nobility, the title of Duke, and participate in the House of Lords.</p>
<p>Deeply Rooted Seeds in the Early Days of the War</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] According to unofficial sources at Buckingham Palace, Elizabeth and Philip's wedding will be held in Westminster Abbey in October. It is learned that Lieutenant Philip gave Princess Elizabeth a ring with three large diamonds some time ago, but the Princess has not worn this ring in public places. Philip first met the Princess when he visited Dartmouth Naval College a few months before the outbreak of the war in 1939. At that time, Philip was eighteen years old and the Princess was thirteen years old. They did not talk when they met, but they often gathered together during the war, especially at the home of Philip's uncle, the current Indian Governor Mountbatten. Love began because of this. However, the marriage proposal was not made until January of this year. At that time, the King asked them to wait a while. After the King and his entourage returned from a tour of South Africa in April, the King expressed his consent, and the lovers became a family.</p>
<p>A Match Made in Heaven Becomes a Reality</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] The husband of Britain's future Queen, Philip Mountbatten, was originally a Greek prince, the sixth heir to the Greek royal family. In order to conclude a good marriage with British Crown Princess Elizabeth, he joined British nationality at the beginning of this year and changed his surname to that of his uncle, Indian Governor Lord Mountbatten. His ancestors were half British and half Danish, and he is the cousin of King George VI. Born in Corfu, he is handsome. It is reported that he will receive the title of Duke after marriage and will convert to the Church of England according to custom. Philip was entrusted to Mountbatten's upbringing at the age of four, studied in Scotland and England, and entered the Royal Naval Academy at the age of eighteen. In 1940, he went to sea for practice and became a naval second lieutenant candidate. Philip is currently a naval lieutenant, 26 years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, and weighs 185 pounds. Although he is of Greek and Danish descent, he has a British demeanor.</p>
<p>Princess Elizabeth's engagement ring is made of platinum inlaid with a large diamond and two small diamonds. The Princess's full name is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor. She is 21 years old, loves literature and music, is 5 feet 5 inches tall, and weighs 136 pounds. She can speak French and German. Like her great-grandfather, King Edward VII, she likes drama and horse racing. She is often seen in London theaters and nightclubs.

<h3>Syria Brewing Civil War: Durzi Tribe Conspires to Overthrow Syrian Government Rule</h3>
<p>[United Press, Damascus, 9th] Arab newspapers here reported on the 9th that the Durzi clans have now concentrated in the Jebel area on the border between Syria and Transjordan, waiting for their chieftain Al-Atrash to issue an order to launch a civil war. Syrian Prime Minister Mardam Bey declared that the Syrian government is very concerned about the conspiracy to overthrow the Syrian authorities in the Jebel area (Note: The Jebel area was an autonomous province under French mandate before the war), and the Syrian Prime Minister has notified King Abdullah of Transjordan of the matter. It is rumored that non-Durzi officials in the Jebel area, in view of the seriousness of the situation, have fled with their families and property, because after the Syrian government's attempt to mediate with the Durzi tribe failed, Chief Al-Atrash issued an order to resolve the matter by force. At the same time, the Syrian Prime Minister has ordered the arrest of Daricha, because he was one of the leaders of the 1925 revolution, and the planning of this new conspiracy is also related to him. In addition, the Syrian Prime Minister announced that he had obtained evidence that three opposition party leaders in Damascus City participated in the next conspiracy, but during the recent general election, he did not intend to order their arrest.</p>
<h3>Soviet Production Increases Sharply, Mostly Exceeding Targets: Design Committee Releases Report</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 9th] The Soviet Planning Committee announced today that in 1947, the area under cultivation increased by 20 million acres, and industrial production increased by 15%.

<h3>Indonesian Provisional Government Expected to Be Established Within Days; Netherlands Still Demands Joint Police Force</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 10th] According to a report from the Dutch News Agency on the 10th, the Indonesian provisional government proposed by the Netherlands will soon be established. According to a spokesman for the Republic, Vice President Hatta and former Prime Minister Sjahrir may be the representatives of Indonesia in the provisional government. The Dutch side may be represented by cabinet advisor Keizer and economic advisor Van Suetstraten, with Van Mook as the chief commissioner.

The Conservative Party's newspaper today pointed out that Indonesia's reply is absolutely unsatisfactory, and at the same time predicted that in Indonesia, extremists will still oppose Prime Minister Sjahrir's policy, so the future of the Indonesian situation is not yet fully optimistic.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, New York, 9th] The New York Times wrote an article today detailing the new developments in the Indonesian situation, stating: "If The Hague can adopt the latest proposals put forward by Indonesia, this will be a milestone in the progress of the Far East from colonies to autonomy, and become a good example of peaceful negotiations for Asian countries. Indonesia will usher in a new era."</p>

<p>The memorial ceremony began with an opening address by Wang Zuliang, President of the Shanghai Branch of the Tsinghua Alumni Association, who reported on the circumstances of Yang's martyrdom. This was followed by a report from Chen Changtong, Manager of the Foreign Department of the Bank of China. Chen and Yang were close friends and associates. He spent much time with Yang in Manila and was the last of his friends to see him. He knew Yang's character very well. When he tearfully recounted Yang's tragic murder by the enemy, he was overcome with grief.</p>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, saying, "Mr. Yang and I were classmates at Tsinghua and also fellow students in the United States. When the news of Mr. Yang's death arrived, I was saddened for many days. Consul-General Yang can be said to be one of the most loyal to the country and the nation. I hope that every citizen in the future, when facing danger, will be willing to sacrifice their lives and take Mr. Yang as an example. Regardless of success or failure, we must emulate Mr. Yang's spirit and put the country and the nation first."</p>
<p>After the Mayor's speech, Dr. Yin Zulan played a mournful song. Then, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating, "Mr. Yang Guang-sheng devoted himself to his country and regarded death as returning home. This spirit can indeed be an example for future generations.

Now that Mr. Guang-sheng has sacrificed himself for the country, this is not only the glory of Wuxing but the glory of the entire nation. Because of Mr. Yang, I recall another martyr from Wuxing, Mr. Chen Yingshi. After Martyr Chen sacrificed himself for the revolution, President Sun sent a mourning couplet. Today, I would like to use these two sentences of the mourning couplet to praise the spirit of Martyr Yang. The words are: 'Holding up the fallen and supporting the endangered, his deeds shine like the sun and moon; achieving righteousness and sacrificing himself, he faces heaven and man without shame.'"</p>

Over the course of fifteen years, they traveled tens of thousands of miles. Of the original 140,000 people, only 8,500 remain. In May of this year, the central government ordered the Ministry of Social Affairs to be responsible for the demobilization of these anti-Japanese heroes. At that time, a Northeastern Volunteer Army transit station was established in Dihua, and they were sent back to the Northeast in batches. After passing through Lanzhou and Xi'an southward, the last eleventh batch departed from Dihua to the east at the beginning of this month. The first batch of about 1,200 people departed from Xuzhou on the evening of the 9th, passed through Nanjing and came to Shanghai, and may arrive today. After arriving in Shanghai, they will wait for ships to take them to Yingkou, Huludao, or Qinhuangdao to be sent back to various places.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeastern Fellow Townsmen Association immediately began preparing a welcome after hearing the news that the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Heroes were about to arrive in Shanghai. The port headquarters also received a notice from the Transportation Department of the Nanjing Joint Logistics Headquarters a few days ago, ordering them to make proper preparations. The party and government organizations held a meeting the night before last to discuss issues such as comforting, welcoming, transportation, and accommodation. It was decided that the logistical support would be the responsibility of the Executive Yuan, and the accommodation would be arranged by the Education Bureau and Fudan and Jiaotong Universities, who would allocate some housing as temporary dormitories. Transportation ships would be the responsibility of the port headquarters, the China Merchants Bureau, and the Jianghai Customs. The comfort activities would be the responsibility of the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau scheduled a meeting at its office at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss the comfort measures with relevant organizations.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers of Zhonghua Publishing House Have Been Fasting for Three Days and Nights</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] More than 300 unemployed workers of the Zhonghua Publishing House's printing factory, demanding reinstatement, have been gathered at the factory on Macau Road for more than two months. Repeated negotiations have failed to yield results. It is reported that the factory stopped supplying food on July 7th, and the workers have also started fasting on the same day. They have been fasting for three days and nights. In addition, because of the hot weather and hunger, many are sick.</p>
<h3>Improvement Planned for the Issuance of Allowances for Public Educators</h3>
<p>Among the public educators in this city, some wish to exchange the allocated goods for cash allowances due to various reasons. However, the current issuance of allowances is slow, sometimes taking more than a month to receive, which, in today's volatile prices, causes considerable losses to ordinary civil servants. In light of this, the municipal government has formulated two improvement measures: (1) All supplying agencies are required to collect the total amount of allowances to be received within one week and quickly submit them to the supplying agency; (2) After receiving the official documents from the supplying agency, the supplying agency is required to issue the due allowance amount to the requesting agency within three days.</p>
<h3>Balancing the Needs of Both Landlords and Tenants; The Land Bureau Schedules a Meeting to Discuss Rent Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The debate over rent standards in this city has been going on for a long time. The Land Bureau has recently formulated a number of measures and has scheduled a joint meeting with relevant French authorities on the 16th of this month to discuss and make a decision. Mayor Wu will personally preside over the meeting at that time.</p>
<p>Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the standards formulated by the Land Bureau this time are based on the resolutions of the Provisional Council and are intended to simultaneously consider the income of landlords and the affordability of tenants as the original intention. The salaries of public educators are adjusted at any time and are flexible, so it is more reasonable to base the rent standard on the multiple of the salaries of public educators. On the one hand, the necessary expenses for landlords to retain property rights are taken into account, and on the other hand, the affordability of tenants is also considered.</p>
<h3>A Few Landlords Drastically Increase Rents; The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association Petitions to Stop Them</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association submitted a petition to the Municipal Government and the Council yesterday, requesting them to stop landlords from drastically increasing rents by multiple amounts. The petition stated: Landlords in this city, before the war, were said to have "every inch of land worth an inch of gold." They lived in luxury and enjoyed peace. During the war, prosperous areas remained intact. Even though the war has spread, Shanghai remains majestic. It is already a great blessing. If they still use food and clothing as an excuse to increase rents, they are pushing the cold masses into further suffering, which is either madness or rebellion. Therefore, the current problem is that the landlords are taking advantage of the situation, which is the same crime as silk merchants hoarding yarn. In the past eight or nine years, landlords have entrusted all the costs of repairs, management, and various taxes to the tenants. All their income is pure profit. Compared to before the war, it has not decreased at all. Now, speaking in terms of multiple proportions, the payment of pre-war deposits in banks, as ruled by the court, is about a thousand times. Compared to the City Council's proposal to increase rent by 1,800 times, it is only half that much. Why can't those landlords understand the difficulties to such an extent? The government authorities are sparing no effort to stabilize people's livelihoods and stop the rise in prices. They should not allow the actions of a few landlords in the important sector of people's lives, namely housing.</p>

<h3>French Concession Tram and Bus Service Temporarily Suspended Yesterday; Unidentified Armed Youths Assault Ticket Inspectors, Arousing Public Outrage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] A French Concession 22-route bus, while stopping at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Route Lafayette around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, had ticket inspector Jin Yinchu, number 52, inspecting the tickets of passengers disembarking the bus. Among them, a youth wearing a Hong Kong shirt had not purchased a ticket. The ticket inspector immediately negotiated with him to purchase one. The youth did not respond but lifted the corner of his coat and patted the handgun tied around his waist, indicating that he was a public official. Ticket inspector number 52, due to the fact the youth was in plain clothes and his identity was difficult to determine, asked which unit he belonged to. The youth still did not answer and instead slapped the ticket inspector and threatened him with his gun. After being insulted, the ticket inspector tried to grab him. At the same time, the conductor and other personnel on the bus also came to his aid. Seeing that he was outnumbered, the youth fled towards Avenue Albert. The ticket inspector relentlessly pursued him. When he approached the entrance of the Third Inspection Brigade of the 423 Garrison Headquarters on the road, the youth hailed the two sentries on guard, turned around, grabbed the ticket inspector, beat him severely, and brought him into the unit. The news spread in an instant, arousing public outrage among all the French Concession tram and bus field personnel, who suspended the service of buses and trams on all lines to protest. Upon hearing the news, the company authorities and the union sent representatives to negotiate with the Third Inspection Brigade. They made four demands: (1) Severely punish the perpetrator. (2) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. (3) Compensate the injured party for medical expenses. (4) Issue a public apology. The captain of the Inspection Brigade, Zhang Hanguang, agreed in principle to the first three demands but did not accept the last one, stating that he needed to investigate the facts. As for the ticket inspector number 52, who was detained in the unit, he was immediately released and taken back by the representatives. The French Concession transportation workers were satisfied with Captain Zhang's response and immediately resumed work. Vehicles on all lines resumed service at 5:30 PM, after a suspension of three and a half hours.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the Municipal Price Evaluation Council is not planning to convene in the short term.

<h3>Table Tennis League Decides the Tenth Act: Shanghai Star Defeats Green Team; Tonight Lianxing Meets Hualianhua</h3>
<p>The second table tennis league concluded the tenth act last night at the original venue. Shanghai Star faced the Green Team. There were more than 400 spectators, and Dai Yongquan and Shen Bohong served as referees. The Green Team once broke through Hualian, creating a great sensation, but yesterday it fought against Shanghai Star and was completely defeated. After the contact, the Shanghai Star generals were incomparably brave. Cheng Aixin, Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, and Wang Changhou defeated the four gates. In the fifth group, Chen Yilong of the Green Team struggled and defeated Huang Gaoyuan of Shanghai Star. In the sixth and seventh groups, each side lost once, and as a result, Shanghai Star defeated the Green Team 5-2. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Star) (Green Team) (Score)</p>
<p>Cheng Aixin Wang Yishan 3-1</p>
<p>Qifang Qin Duyan 3-0</p>
<p>Xue Xuchu Chen Yinzhou 3-0</p>
<p>5 Changhou Dai Ranxing 3-1</p>
<p>Huang Gaoyuan Chen Yilong 2-3</p>
<p>Li Zongpei Li Peiran Li Retired</p>
<p>Yu Cheng Li Ronglong Li Retired</p>
<p>Starting at eight o'clock tonight, the show will continue at the original venue, with Lianxing playing Hualianhua. The referees are Li Longbiao and Dai Yongquan, and the recorder is Tang Fuwan. Lianxing, the runner-up of the first division, has successively defeated Post A and Post B in the final, showing its brilliance. Although Hualianhua has lost three times, its results are outstanding. Tonight, when it meets Lianxing, the hope of victory is relatively high.</p>
<h3>China Youth Volleyball A Group Tournament: Yongan Red Meets Soviet Union Tonight</h3>
<p>The volleyball league hosted by the Chinese Youth Association, the fourth act tonight, will still be held in the fitness room of the association in Baxianqiao at 5:30 PM this afternoon. In the women's group, Fuhua will play against Jinde Blue, and in the B Youth Division, Shantou Team will play against Nanxing. In the A group, Yongan Red will meet Soviet Red for the first time. However, due to the issue of the evacuation of overseas Chinese back to their country, the Soviet Union originally participated in two teams each in the A and B groups, and now it has been decided to merge into one team. Today, they will play with a mixed brigade. In terms of strength, they are still considerable. Yongan Red is the incarnation of Guangdong, and made its debut last week, directly defeating Jiguang by three goals. There will definitely be a fierce battle with the foreign army at that time. The program for today is as follows:</p>
<p>Fuhua - Jinde Blue (Women's) 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Shantou Team - Nanxing (B Youth) 6:10 PM</p>
<p>Yongan Red - Soviet Red (A Group) 7:00 PM</p>
<h3>"Collective Voice" Can't Pass the Fifth Checkpoint</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore Airmail] The Philippine "Collective Voice" basketball team, which was invincible domestically last year, encountered defeat in its southern expedition to Malaya. They were defeated by the Singapore United team at the fifth checkpoint with a score of 46 to 41, a difference of two and a half goals. In this battle, "Collective Voice" not only lost but also lost in an ungraceful manner. Players lost their temper and disagreed with the referee's decisions, even repeatedly insisting on withdrawing from the game midway during the last quarter. Their bias for victory and aversion to defeat, as well as their emotional impulsiveness, completely disregarded sportsmanship and the spirit of athletics. This aroused much dissatisfaction among the audience, leading to jeers and shouts. Originally, "Collective Voice" had given a very good impression in several matches in Singapore. This time, their transgression and misbehavior not only lost the audience's sympathy but also tarnished their past reputation, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Overseas Fans Exclaim in Awe</p>
<p>"Collective Voice," together with the Hong Kong Sing Tao Football Team, arrived in Singapore on the 13th of this month, scheduled to play seven matches in Singapore, two of which were charity matches to raise education funds for a Fujian association. They first displayed their skills on the evening of the 15th, narrowly defeating the Singapore Mixed Team with a score of 60 to 47. (I say narrowly because "Collective Voice" had, unusually, been at a disadvantage by three points in the first half). Subsequently, carrying the momentum of victory, "Collective Voice" successively broke through three checkpoints, defeating Selangor Team 49 to 37, Business &amp; Industry Team 54 to 42 (Business &amp; Industry had won the All-Singapore Championship consecutively in 1946 and 1947), and Perak Team 74 to 61. In these matches, "Collective Voice" consistently performed well. Their superb skills and excellent spirit were highly appreciated by the people of Singapore, especially Cai Wenhua's leaping, turning, and one-handed shots; Qiu Guai Cai Wenzhang's all-court flying; Chen Jinde's advancing, retreating, attacking, and defending with assured command; as well as all the feints, rotating attacks (what the Filipinos call "lawu-lawu"), and butterfly-like weaving tactics, which left overseas fans exclaiming in awe. Originally, each checkpoint's defenders had their own famous players, such as Gong Bangjie, Yin Hongxiang, and Li Guorui, who were all veterans from the Central Plains. However, they were unfortunately too old and could not compare with the energetic athletes of "Collective Voice."</p>
<p>The Fifth Checkpoint Encounters a Strong Opponent</p>
<p>However, it must be said that the level of sports in Malaya is not low after all. While older players are difficult to contend with, young fellows are still brave and valiant. The "Collective Voice" team rushed through four checkpoints but ultimately stumbled at the fifth checkpoint, encountering a strong opponent: the Singapore United team. In terms of lineup, the Singapore United team possessed the essence of all Singapore, and their strength should not be underestimated. Center Huang Fuxi is six feet two inches tall, as tall as Hollywood star Gary Cooper. His ball-grabbing and passing are both fast and accurate. Forwards Lin Wendian and Huang Shuhao, and guards Li Yinan and Hou Shenhu, are all battle-tested veterans. The lineup is very ideal. On the other hand, "Collective Voice" had already played several games, and their playing style and weaknesses were somewhat exposed and discovered by their opponents. Therefore, before the match, newspaper commentators believed that even if the Singapore United team lost, it would not be a crushing defeat, and even if "Collective Voice" won, it would be a laborious victory. "Collective Voice" knew that this battle would be against a strong opponent, so they also fielded their strongest team: Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, Chen Jinzhi, and Yang Renhui. But even with a strong team, they still suffered a defeat. In theory, victory and defeat are commonplace for soldiers, and losing a game is not a big deal. Unfortunately, "Collective Voice" was too eager to win and completely forgot about morality and sportsmanship. They lost their composure in front of everyone during the defeat, which led to an unpleasant scene, with the audience shouting "Hit them!" and the players being surrounded after the game, almost unable to leave the stadium.</p>
<p>The Course of Events Was as Follows</p>
<p>The course of events was as follows: The unpleasantness began in the fourth quarter of the game. With about six or seven minutes left until the end of the game, "Collective Voice" was at a disadvantage, trailing by nine points. Guard Yang Renhui intercepted the ball in the chaos and rushed forward along the edge. The situation was tense. The United Team's defense stepped forward to block him. Just as the saying goes, "No sooner said than done," roughly when their bodies came into contact with each other, the referee blew his silver whistle and ruled that Yang Renhui had committed a foul. In Yang Renhui's view, the fault was on the other side, but he was penalized instead. He felt that the referee was unfair and immediately protested. However, the referee did not budge, and the protest was ineffective. He then angrily left the court. The referee then ruled a technical foul, and the entire "Collective Voice" team stopped playing. Deputy leader Cai Dawen also came out to negotiate. While they were arguing, the audience shouted, and the order was in great chaos. After the Consul General in Singapore, Wu Bosheng, came forward to mediate, the game barely continued. The "Collective Voice" players, after this stimulation, had lost their composure. In less than two minutes, another dispute arose. Chen Jinzhi committed a foul and was also ruled out of the game. The anger of "Collective Voice" increased even further, and the entire team put on their jackets again. After much persuasion, Li Shiqiao, Hu Bingjun, Cai Lianke, Chen Jinde, and Cai Wenhua reluctantly took the field. In the last minute, they once managed to close the gap to only two points, but finally the game ended with a score of 46 to 41. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Impressions of Sing Tao's Southern Expedition (II)</h3>
<p>Little Gao Shannu's performance was the most disappointing. He is responsible for the right wing, but he often mistakenly goes to the inside forward position, resulting in several times when the ball was lobbed to the right wing, but he failed to respond. His ball-handling skills are also far inferior to before. The "old waiting for the ball to come to my feet" problem of center forward Feng Jingxiang has not been removed. He is a typical designer. He has never had any aerial skills, nor the courage to sprint and hard tackle. His advantage is distributing to the wings and creating scoring opportunities for the inside forwards. This skill has not been matched by any Chinese player to date. In several matches in Singapore this time, his short passes and long balls have been quite impressive, but because he cannot grab the ball and dares not shoot, it always feels a bit lacking. However, for someone over forty years old to still maintain this level, it is indeed worthy of our respect. Inside forward Li Zhaorong's shots are powerful and accurate, making him the most threatening member of Sing Tao's forward line. His shooting can be done from any angle, whether it is a turning volley or a direct kick, he has his own way. He also has a superhuman ability, which is composure. Even in the chaotic array of heads and feet, he still commands calmly and can clearly see where the enemy's weaknesses are. His weakness is that he doesn't like to run much, perhaps because he is too fat. Sing Tao Football Team wins because their forwards are rich in opportunities for trickery, and there is also full understanding and coordination between them. They are not rushed in front of the goal, they never miss a shot, their passing is agile, and their changes are alert. However, their defense is inversely proportional. They cannot fully control the distribution, nor can they prevent the enemy's wings from flanking. As a result, as soon as the enemy forwards advance, they immediately force the door, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Under these circumstances, their own forwards have to retreat to help defend. By the time the siege is relieved and the ball is swung towards the opponent, the forwards are too late to push forward. This simply wears out the forward line. By the second half, they are exhausted, and the wonderfulness is lost. This phenomenon was clearly evident in the first three games. In the first battle against Sing Hua, they drew 3-3. All three goals scored by Sing Tao were in the first half. In the second half, not only did they make no progress, but they were also seized by Sing Hua for three consecutive goals. In the second battle against the Military United, although they won with an absolute advantage of 5-1, all five goals were also scored in the first half, and the result in the second half was only 0-0. In the third battle against Sing Min United, the score was 5-3. Although four goals were scored in the second half, all four goals were scored in the first ten minutes, taking advantage of the forwards' vigor. After that, it became a stage of "every bush an enemy." Although Sing Min United was only able to recover two goals, their advantage at that time was simply one-sided. It was only a pity that their forwards' shots were not accurate enough and they did not know how to seize opportunities. Otherwise, Sing Tao might have suffered a defeat in this game. Sing Tao's weak defensive power has never been remedied. So, when they faced the Ma Hua team that day, they happened to encounter the forwards' failure, and the entire army collapsed. Originally, Sing Tao's forwards failed and also encountered the iron-wall defenders Chen Jiashou and Chen Jiawan, making them feel even more inferior and at a loss. This is the main reason for Sing Tao's failure. (It is heard that Sing Tao has invited Chen Jiashou to participate in a trip to England.)</p>

<h3>The China Trust Bureau Determines Purchase Methods for Imported Cotton Without Import Permits; Methods for Subsidized Spinning and Export of Yarn are Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the imported cotton that arrived at the port before April 30th of this year and for which import permits could not be obtained, the Central Bank previously decided to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to purchase it on behalf of the government. In order to smoothly advance this work, the China Trust Bureau specially convened a group meeting at the bureau at about 3 PM yesterday afternoon. Shao Zenghua and Wu Changfu from the Central Bank, Zhang Sili and Xu Zansan from the China Textile Construction Company, Rong Yixin from the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, 　Zhiquan from the Auditing Department, and others attended, chaired by Zhang Xu from the China Trust Bureau. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM, and the main decisions were as follows:</p>
<p>Scope of Purchase</p>
<p>(1) Cotton that shipped before November 24th of last year and arrived at the port before April 30th of this year, for which import permits could not be obtained, will be purchased.</p>
<p>(2) Cotton that shipped after November 24th of last year but was sold before November 24th (sold to flower shops or yarn factories) and arrived at the port before April 30th of this year, for which import permits could not be obtained, will be purchased.</p>
<p>(3) The deadline for applying to the Trust Bureau for purchase in this case is set at the end of July, and applications will not be accepted after the deadline.</p>
<p>Purchase Price</p>
<p>(1) The purchase price shall be based on the original price (True C.I.F. Value) stipulated in the sales contract between the foreign packing plant and the local importer, and shall be accompanied by valid proof such as the letter of credit issued by the bank at that time or other documents.</p>
<p>(2) Commissions paid by the importer to the flower shop or yarn factory will not be paid.</p>
<p>(3) Dock rent and other necessary national currency expenses payable after arrival at the port may also be paid after verification.</p>
<p>Payment Method</p>
<p>After the price is approved, the applicant shall submit all documents to the China Trust Bureau, and payment procedures will be processed after verification.</p>
<p>In addition, detailed methods for cotton yarn spinning and methods for subsidized yarn sales to various factories will be discussed by the China Textile Construction Company in conjunction with the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association before further consultation and decision with the China Trust Bureau. The government will negotiate the export of this batch of cotton yarn in order to recover foreign exchange as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Cotton Merchants' Opinions</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Cotton Business Association convened a trade discussion meeting the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of purchasing imported cotton. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM. According to the association's chairman, Liu Pingxun, after the Central Bank announced the handling methods for purchasing imported cotton arriving at the port, the association immediately received a notice. Afterwards, he convened relevant traders to discuss and listen to opinions several times. He then contacted the China Trust Bureau, and the deadlock in the discussions was the issue of exchange rate prices, which was difficult to approach. The China Trust Bureau's regulations for purchasing cotton stipulate that the US dollars paid by cotton merchants when placing orders with foreign countries in the past should be converted into national currency according to the official exchange rate and paid to the cotton merchants. This point makes cotton merchants not only unprofitable but also at a loss, so cotton merchants cannot accept it. Cotton merchants used black market foreign exchange in the past, which was higher than the official price, and most of the cotton was ordered during December of last year and January and February of this year. At that time, the price of foreign cotton was generally around 38 to 39 US cents per pound, but it has now reached 44 US cents. Therefore, there is a significant difference based on the price set when ordering, which would cause cotton merchants to suffer double losses, which is naturally difficult to sacrifice. However, in order to take into account the difficulties of both the government and the merchants, the association proposed a compromise solution: (1) Please pay the cotton merchants the original amount of US dollars they paid in the past, allowing them to use it, and the unpaid portion owed to foreign merchants should be handled by the China Trust Bureau itself. (2) If the authorities must recover the US dollars stored by the cotton merchants, the cotton merchants request that the price be calculated according to the current US price. Please also consider subsidizing the exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stock Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks had low transaction volume yesterday. With no external stimulus, market prices further weakened. The telephone sector suffered most from unfavorable conditions. British American Tobacco also softened due to heavy offloading. Ewo Cotton Mill started at $81,500 in the morning, dropping slightly to close at $79,000. Foreign firms were selling, while securities houses and individual investors also engaged in selling. As a result, telephone shares fell by 10% compared to the previous close, British American Tobacco also fell by 5%, and the remaining stocks showed mixed performance.</p>
<p>Government bonds also weakened yesterday. Unified Bonds (Class C) opened at $7,100 in the morning, immediately falling to $6,300 before recovering slightly, eventually fluctuating around $6,800. As a result, Classes A, B, and D fell by $100 compared to the previous close, while Classes C and E also fell by $200. Market participants believed that rooms 360 and 549 were sellers, while rooms 539 and 503 were buyers, with a total transaction volume of around 2 million.</p>
<p>Three Types of Government Bonds Drawn for Principal Repayment</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance held a lottery in Shanghai at 10 AM yesterday for the redemption of principal for the 1936 Recovery Public Bonds, the 12th redemption of the 2nd series of 1939 Construction Public Bonds, and the 9th redemption of the 1st series of 1941 Military Needs Public Bonds. (1) For the Recovery Public Bonds, 18 numbers were drawn, with a total principal repayment of $6,120,000. (2) For the Construction Public Bonds, 10 numbers were drawn, with a total principal repayment of $3,000,000. (3) For the Military Needs Public Bonds, 5 numbers were drawn, with a total principal repayment of $2,000,000.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Deposit Issues</h3>
<p>Banking Industry Provides Guarantees; Court Considers Exempting from Provisional Execution</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that the National Federation of Banking Associations is reporting that when the courts in Hankou order local banks to pay double the amount for pre-war deposits, they often grant provisional execution based on the plaintiff's request, causing deep anxiety among the banking industry. The Federation has reportedly sent representatives to consult with the Ministry of Finance, which has agreed that banks can provide guarantees to avoid provisional execution. In addition, the banking industries in Tianjin are planning to establish a joint reserve association, and the Banking Association will provide technical assistance and apply to the government for approval to establish it.</p>
<h3>Yung Shing's Capital Increase Imminent; Sino-Foreign's Brilliance Revealed</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for Yung Shing Cotton Mill to adjust interest rates before its capital increase. Active traders abandoned Yung Shing and switched to Sino-Foreign as an alternative, resulting in Sino-Foreign reaching its limit price with transactions at a premium. Yung Shing, on the other hand, retreated in steps and closed in a tired state. Small stocks such as King Fook and New Light were the most popular. The market opened stable in the morning. After the opening of Yung Shing, drop-period selling was encountered, with Nos. 54 and 104 offering to sell, and Nos. 157, 142, 231, and 117 all selling Yung Shing, forcing the price down to $10,880. Current Yung Shing also reached a low price of $10,480. Nos. 234, 224, 24, 85, and 69 advanced to over $11,000, while Nos. 177, 106, 36, and arbitrageurs were all selling, still struggling. Nos. 85, 224, 137, 223, 234, 154, 104, 181, 31, and 105 advanced to $11,420. Suddenly, a large buying trend arose for Sino-Foreign, with Nos. 89, 160, 84, 224, 159, and 69 all advancing, taking Yung Shing's place, and the price rose again and again, reaching the limit price. Drop-period Yung Shing, Nos. 611, 185, and 163, offered at high prices, and Nos. 89 and 171 also sold Yung Shing, forcing drop-period Yung Shing down to $11,200. However, Sino-Foreign's rising trend remained strong, and people still had some nostalgia, with Nos. 218, 65, 207, and 142 advancing to $11,420. Nos. 76, 148, 36, and 69 took advantage of the situation to sell, and drop-period Yung Shing fell below $11,250. But at this time, people's sentiment was still good, and Sino-Foreign's current delivery was taken over by No. 152, and the drop-period delivery was taken over by Nos. 116 and 8, all at the limit price. Drop-period Yung Shing was bought by Nos. 152 and 19, and current Yung Shing was absorbed by No. 220. At 10:20 AM, drop-period Yung Shing rose again to over $11,400. The gray market for drop-period Sino-Foreign even had a premium of $60. American Asia, New Light, and King Fook all showed vitality. However, since Yung Shing was about to implement a capital increase, most of the major market players were gradually leaving to switch to Sino-Foreign and American Asia. The off-market interest rate opened very high. Therefore, Nos. 154, 218, and 183 sold current Yung Shing, and Nos. 231, 83, 224, 183, 54, 76, 32, 12, 102, 142, and 89 all released a lot of stock. At 12:15 PM, drop-period Yung Shing fell to a low price of $10,760. After absorption by Nos. 219 and 22, it still rose back to $10,950. Nos. 224, 218, 129, 148, etc., still came to close out positions, and the noon close retreated to $2,800. After the close, No. 61 and others offered to sell, and the final price rose to over $10,850. Current King Fook soared by $10 to close, and the difference with drop-period delivery was only $2, indicating that the circulating chips were extremely scarce. The results compared to the previous close were: Sino-Foreign rose to the limit, New Light and American Asia rose slightly, China Flour and France Flour were flat, Yung Shing and Chin Hsing fell slightly, Yung Kong and King Fook each rose by more than 5%, New China alone fell by more than 10%, Commercial and King Lun rose by more than 5%, Matches, China Silk, Wuhe, Datong, and National Products all rose, Lilian fell by 5%, and New Asia Underwear fell slightly. Drop-period stocks: Sino-Foreign rose to the limit, King Fook, New Asia, and American Asia each rose by about 10%, Yung Kong and China Flour each rose by 5%, Yung Shing rose but only slightly, and Tung Hsing saw a slight decrease. In the off-market, old stocks such as World Paper Mill were still difficult to recover, and the rest were stable.</p>
<h3>Not Many Arbitrage Transactions Between Current and Drop-Period Delivery</h3>
<p>Yesterday's arbitrage transactions between current and drop-period delivery had an interest rate of around $0.14 to $0.20. Yung Shing rose from $460 to $540 and closed at $510. Banking groups Nos. 181, 174, 74, 31, and 320 bought in, and Nos. 4, 89, 149, 224, and 173 sold out. Sino-Foreign ranged from $165 to $190, and New Light ranged from $9 to $10. Transaction volume was low.</p>
<h3>Rayon Falls; Factory-Management Transactions Are Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market initially showed firmness, but ultimately fell due to the imbalance between supply and demand. No. 120, Asahi, was bid at $31 million, with the largest bid at $1.5 million, but no transaction occurred. Due to the abundance of sellers, prices declined, and the noon close had retreated to $30 million. Dongyang rayon was traded at $30.3 million. In the afternoon, sentiment remained weak, and prices fell below the $30 million mark again, with the final price at $29.7 million. No. 150, Asahi, and No. 75, Semi-Gloss, were abundant in the market because the silk weaving joint venture distributed a large number of them to silk factories, but they were not practical, so the prices also plummeted. No. 150, Asahi, had the same price as No. 210, and No. 75, Semi-Gloss, was only $3 million higher than No. 120, Asahi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, factory-management transactions were very quiet. Market prices were stable. Grades A, B, and C still had no transactions, only Grade D was traded at $33.3 million, and Grade E was traded at $2.8 million, but the payment was due in one week. Spot transactions were at $2 million for mid-grade goods and $3 million for high-grade goods. The dried-goods market price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market continued to decline. American Asia bedspreads were traded at $3.4 million, and Dachen bedspreads were traded at $2.75 million, with bids as high as $800,000. China Strong goods were also traded at $2.7 million. Dachen checkered crepe suffered an even greater decline, opening at $41,000 and falling all the way to a low of $39,800. Later, major players pulled it up, reversing the decline, but ultimately it did not improve. The spot price at the close was $40,000, and the deferred price was $40,400. China Kam crepe softened slightly due to raw materials. Yesterday, high-end goods were traded at $27,000.</p>
<h3>The Textile Adjustment Committee Actively Plans to Promote Yarn and Fabric Exports</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to Yuan Zhongda, Director of the Secretariat of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the Committee is actively planning how to promote the export of yarn and fabric. It is rumored that the recent rise in yarn and fabric prices in Shanghai is related to the Committee's promotion of yarn and fabric exports. In fact, the Committee's plan is to find ways to increase the national cotton yarn production by two-sixths based on the current production volume and then use this increase of two-sixths to promote exports. Therefore, it will not affect the domestic yarn and fabric supply. In order to handle the promotion of exports, the Committee will send four specialists to foreign countries to investigate the market conditions and the demand for yarn and fabric. At the same time, it will ask national and private yarn factories to each send 20 specialists to assist the Committee in planning the promotion.</p>
<h3>As of June 30th, the Total Sales of US Dollar Bonds Nationwide Reached More Than 41 Million</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to the US Dollar Bond Sales Committee, the sales performance of bonds nationwide as of June 30th was: US Dollar Public Bonds $20,950,700, Short-Term Treasury Bills $20,471,600, totaling $41,422,300. Among them, Shanghai accounted for the largest number: US Dollar Public Bonds $18,687,300, Short-Term Bills $10,462,820, totaling $29,150,120.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday's total sales of treasury bills was $72,680, of which New China Bank sold $45,500 and Guangdong Bank sold $10,000.</p>
<h3>Fund Depository Institutions to be Approved Independently by the Committee</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the fund issue for the 1947 US Dollar Public Bonds, according to the organizational regulations of the US Dollar Bond Fund Supervisory Committee, the Ministry of Finance should allocate the fund (foreign exchange fund) to the institution designated by the Committee before each public bond matures for principal and interest payments. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has issued an official document instructing the Central Bank to allocate the funds accordingly. However, it has recently been found that the Public Treasury Law stipulates that whenever treasury funds are transferred to any institution, the receiving institution must deposit the received treasury funds with the Central Bank. The organizational regulations of the US Dollar Bond Committee were promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. As a result, the fund depository methods stipulated in the organizational regulations cannot supersede the provisions of the Public Treasury Law. However, in order to demonstrate greater trustworthiness and avoid the fund being deposited with the Central Bank, the Bond Committee has requested the Ministry of Finance to forward a request to the Executive Yuan, asking the National Government to separately approve the Bond Committee's independent designation of the fund's depository institution. It is heard that the National Government has approved this case. Once the official document is issued to the Bond Committee, the Committee will send a letter to the Central Bank requesting that the British gold be allocated accordingly. In the future, the foreign exchange gold will be considered for deposit with the Bank of China in New York. As for the fund issue for short-term treasury bills, it is heard that the Bond Committee is currently submitting a request to the Ministry of Finance to allocate the funds to the Committee for safekeeping before each treasury bill matures for principal and interest payments.</p>
<h3>Stores Actively Buy to Strengthen Their Stocks; Rice Prices Decline and Then Rise; Vegetable Oil Prices Decline by Ten Thousand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets combined received more than 8,300 piculs of rice. The market initially declined but then rose. At noon, stores took the opportunity to actively buy, strengthening their stocks. As a result, japonica and indica rice rose slightly by 3,000 to 5,000, while white rice remained mediocre.</p>
<p>Flour digestion became active again, declining and then recovering, rising by 3,000 to 4,000. Wheat bran followed the rise by 2,000. Soybean cake had normal purchasing power in rural areas, and the situation was flat and unremarkable. Yingkou cake fell by 3,000 to 5,000 due to the suspension of operations in Shantou. The oil market also declined due to the suspension of operations in the Guangdong region. Vegetable oil all saw a decline of ten thousand. Rapeseed oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000. Sesame oil and light oil remained temporarily flat. Soybean customers did not move, and prices tended to soften, with a slight reduction of 2,000 to 3,000. Red beans continued to be pursued by Nanyang, and prices rose by ten thousand. However, mid-grade beans remained mediocre. Broad beans were similar, and retail sales in this area were not smooth. Outbound sales were scarce, falling by 3,000 to 5,000. Peas were fixed, Yuan wheat was fixed, wheat was cheap, raw peanuts fell by 3,000 to 5,000, sesame was scarce and still rising, and corn was similar.</p>

When applying for the transportation of cotton yarn to North China, manufacturers must attach their factory warehouse receipts or tax bills.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Market Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market conditions were affected by tight credit, and yarn factories showed a slight slowdown in purchases. However, both wholesalers and retailers continued to cover their positions, so prices remained firm. However, due to the balance between supply and demand, trading was slightly less active than the previous day, and the market remained stable. The opening prices for various grades for delivery to factories were: US Memphis Strict Middling at 2.15 million, Bao at 2.15 million, 2.2 million to 2.25 million. The prices for delivery at the warehouse were: US Strict Middling at 2.5 million, US Middling at 2.5 million, US Middling at 2.08 million, L.S.S. at 2.15 million, Lingbao at 2.12 million, 2.15 million to 2.2 million, Shashi at 2.03 million to 2.07 million, Han Fine at 1.92 million to 1.95 million, Dazhongji at 1.95 million, Pengjiapo at 2.15 million, Huoji at 1.885 million to 1.7 million, Zhoupu seed cotton at 340,000 per load.</p>
<h3>Fine Yarn Weak, Coarse Yarn Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market initially followed the upward trend of the previous days, but buyer interest waned, credit became tight again, cloth prices fell, and sentiment stabilized, causing the market to weaken suddenly. Later, demand emerged on dips, and dyeing and weaving factories also came to pick up goods, causing the market to rebound. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell slightly by 200,000 to 19.8 million, while 20-count Special Double Horse yarn rose by 100,000 to 1.23 million. Other 32-count fine yarns fell slightly, while 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, and other coarse yarns all rose by about 100,000.</p>
<h3>Developing the Nanyang Market: Overseas Chinese Hope for Domestic Goods Sales in Nanyang</h3>
<p>Zhang Shoushi, Standing Director and General Manager of the Hong Kong China Nanyang Economic Association, invited local economic scholars Wei Youye, Zhu Sihuang, and others to discuss the Nanyang market issue at the Bankers Club yesterday. Zhang Yifan first introduced the topic, and then Zhang Shoushi reported on the current situation of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, stating that overseas Chinese are currently under dual oppression and are in a worse situation than before, and they feel very distressed about the current situation in their motherland. They hope that national industries can gain a significant position in the Nanyang market. Finally, those present believed that the obstacles to selling domestic goods in Nanyang are domestic rather than foreign. One is the excessively low exchange rate, and the other is the excessively high domestic prices. They unanimously hoped that the association could take on the responsibility of communicating between the domestic market and overseas Chinese in Nanyang.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Procurement Procedures: Four Banks Jointly to Provide Loans, Flour Industry to Nominate Xi Debing and Rong Yiren for Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to sources, the Ministry of Food has recently finalized the procurement procedures for new wheat this year. The capital portion will be allocated by the Four Banks Joint Office, providing the ministry with 300 billion yuan for application. The loan agreement will be signed this week in Nanjing by Director Wang of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food and the Nanjing branch of the Central Bank. The procurement matters will be handled by the various branches of the China Farmers Bank entrusted by the Ministry of Food. However, in order to expedite the procurement process, the Fourth District Flour Industry Association and its five major factories, including Fuxin, Maoxin, Huafeng, Yutong, and Fufeng, will jointly form a procurement price review committee with the grain industry associations in various producing areas. The procurement area is limited to the original wheat distribution centers along the Yangtze River, including Hankou, Wuhu, Pinghu, Suzhou, Taixian, and other places. After a certain amount has been procured, it will be collected and sold on behalf of the five major factories such as Fuxin. The handling fee per bag is between 15,000 and 20,000 yuan, and the Ministry of Food is responsible for overall allocation. It is expected to officially start in the second half of this month. Currently, the flour industry has nominated Xi Debing of Fufeng Factory and Rong Yiren of Maoxin to conduct negotiations on the future, and it is also planned to request the authorities to support small and medium-sized factories in the industry.</p>
<h3>Cotton Production in Shaanxi and Hubei Not Drastically Reduced</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recent reports have indicated that cotton production in Shaanxi, Hubei, and other places this year has been significantly reduced compared to the pre-war period. According to a cotton textile industry authority in this city, this report is not entirely accurate. Taking Shaanxi as an example, in 1937, the production was 1,067,612 dan, last year's production was 711,000 dan, and this year's estimate is more than 1 million dan. In Hubei Province, in 1937, the production was 1,517,337 dan, last year's production was 1,721,000 dan, and this year's estimate is 1.9 million dan. If there were no natural disasters and disturbances, the above-mentioned output would not be limited to this and could even exceed the pre-war output. As for the total number of spindles in our country, the most accurate statistics are 4,512,890, with 4,061,000 actually operating. However, due to insufficient electricity and shortened working hours, the operating efficiency is 85% of the pre-war level. To date, the cotton textile industry has the most generous profits in the national industrial sector, and there is no crisis as rumored.</p>
<h3>Dyed Cloth Market Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw insiders selling at high prices and retailers liquidating their positions. In addition, due to strict investigations by the authorities, buyers remained cautious, and the market suddenly weakened. As a result, the off-exchange price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell back to 471,000 yuan. Fine cloths such as Five Happiness Blue Chicken, Colored Ball, and Yanghe also fell slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, due to increased dye and labor costs, the prices of dark blue Drill and blue cloth rose sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. The Textile Construction Company sold 26 types of cloth, with Blue Chicken fine cloth rising to 420,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Start Production</h3>
<p>The Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Economic Affairs released two pieces of news yesterday. (1) Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have started production one after another. The spring cocoons collected this spring have now been completely transported into warehouses. The committee once stipulated that production should start from July 1st to 15th. Currently, the dry cocoon mortgage loans are being processed by the China Farmers Bank. To date, more than a dozen factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, including Fuhua, Yongkang, and Dingxin, have started production. The rest will be able to start production completely within a few days. (2) Research on autumn silkworm eggs. Regarding the sale price, quantity, and acid treatment date of autumn silkworm eggs, the committee's tenth meeting designated a group consisting of Shao Shenpei, Xu Danren, Zhu Xinyu, Jiang Shiqi, and Guan Yi to be responsible for research and first solicit the opinions of the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It is also learned that the committee will submit the topic for discussion at its eleventh meeting on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Market Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign tea market saw a sudden surge in trading, and the market continued to rise. Initially, prices only increased slightly, but then the upward trend intensified, and as a result, the price of each grade rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per dan compared to the previous day. The reason for this is the rumor that France and Morocco may open up trade in Chinese tea, and it is feared that this will become a reality. At the same time, the French trading company Yongxing has finalized a deal for 900 tons of Chun Mee green tea, which will be delivered and exported within a few days. It is said that it has been distributed to local exporters in this city, who are actively rushing to ship it overseas, leading to increasingly strong buying sentiment in the market. Currently, in addition to Shui Xing Trading Company acquiring 2,000 boxes, Tongfu Trading Company and Wuchang and other tea companies have also acquired around 1,000 boxes. Under these circumstances, sentiment is naturally bullish. As for domestic sales of black and green tea, they have been performing consistently well recently, and prices are also extraordinarily strong. The future is particularly optimistic.</p>
<h3>Food Business Tax: Food Associations in Various Regions Request Continued Exemption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The food associations of four provinces, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and two cities, Beijing and Shanghai, held a joint meeting at the Zhejiang Provincial Association on Beijing West Road in this city at around 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Huang Tongsheng. The representatives from various regions unanimously requested the government to extend the exemption period for the business tax on food, as the current exemption period is about to expire at the end of October this year. It was decided that a meeting would be held again at the YMCA at 12:00 noon today to nominate representatives to go to Beijing to petition the relevant ministries and departments.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Warehouse Receipt Trading: Principle Already Determined</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of restricting warehouse receipt trading, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that the principle has been decided. For daily necessities and goods circulating in this city, the delivery period must be restricted. The time limit for transit exports can be slightly relaxed to reduce the inconvenience for merchants. As for the specific dates for each item, after separately convening representatives from the tallow cake and food industry, the rice and grain industry, the fuel and Burmese powder industry, and the sugar, yarn, and cloth industry for discussions in the next two days, the dates can be determined and submitted to the Economic Council for decision and implementation.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cigarette prices continued to rise. The highest price for a pack of ten Great British cigarettes was 8.7 million yuan. The price slightly retreated in the afternoon session, and the final listed price was 8.65 million yuan, an increase of 230,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife also rose to 7.58 million yuan, and Five Flowers and Ardath both rose by more than 100,000 yuan. Other Chinese merchant cigarettes, such as Beauty, Million, Brandy, and Crest, also rose by 500 to 1,000 yuan. However, high-grade cigarettes in white tin packaging saw a decline.</p>
<h3>Native Tobacco Sales Prices Increased</h3>
<p>Recently, the various local tobacco merchants in this city have found it difficult to operate due to the sharp increase in costs. Therefore, they held the fourth joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the industry association yesterday to discuss tobacco prices. It was decided to increase wholesale prices as follows: (per 100 market catties, unit: thousand yuan)</p>
<p>Lanzhou Water Tobacco</p>
<p>1,500</p>
<p>Medium Grade 1,000</p>
<p>Low Grade 650</p>
<p>Native Sun-Cured Tobacco 729</p>

<p>Fujian Shredded Tobacco 10 taels 7.5</p>
<p>Medium Grade 10 taels 6</p>
<p>Low Grade 10 taels 4</p>
<h3>Xiang Mao Adjusts Factory Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the continuous rise in the prices of various raw materials, the production costs of China Soap Company have increased sharply. Therefore, the factory prices of Huang Xiang Mao Soap and other products have been adjusted appropriately. It is reported that the price of Huang Xiang Mao Soap is 350,000 yuan per case, the price of Bai Xiang Mao Soap is 475,000 yuan per case, the price of Sunlight Soap is 600,000 yuan per case, and the price of Lever Brothers Sanitary Medicinal Soap is also 600,000 yuan. As a result, the soap market in the city was unusually stable yesterday. There were mostly scattered purchases from individual customers, while large customers remained cautious. As a result, the prices of various soaps were lower by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Summer Precautions: Street Vendors Selling Cold Drinks and Cooked Food</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen wine shops, food stores, and food stalls along the street selling cold drinks, cooked chicken, cooked meat, and the like. These foods and drinks are most likely to attract flies, which are a medium for spreading typhoid and cholera germs. If we do not plan ahead now, we will regret it if an epidemic breaks out in the future! However, strict prohibition is likely to cause disturbances and unrest. Excessive leniency will be viewed as if nothing is happening. The best approach is to increase public knowledge so that people are aware of the dangers and are unwilling to buy or eat them. Then the sellers will not be able to make a profit or even suffer losses, so they have no reason not to change their business. Therefore, I have made slogans on the left: Street vendors selling cold drinks are a concentrated pool of germs. Street vendors selling cooked food are a breeding ground for the god of plague.</p>
<h3>Are You Anemic?</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>Fatigue, exhaustion, lack of energy may be the result of anemia. Anemia weakens the work efficiency of countless people. During the war, the world did not doubt its progress and harmed the lives of thousands of people. Now there are many facts about anemia, do you know them? Please see:</p>
<p>Anemia is a deficiency of red blood cells - correct. People with anemia may have insufficient red blood cells, or they may have a normal number of red blood cells, but insufficient red blood pigment.</p>
<p>Anemia is a new disease, a product of civilization - incorrect. As early as 1670, the English physician Sydenham recognized anemia and treated the disease with iron. Early medical records also mention anemia. Liver treatment for pernicious anemia was only recently discovered in the United States.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin is the substance that makes red blood cells red - correct. Hemoglobin is a complex protein that transports gas and carbon dioxide and contains iron, trace amounts of copper, and other essential substances.</p>
<p>Except for the loss of bleeding, red blood cells are a permanent part of the body - incorrect. Blood cells are constantly dying and constantly regenerating. The average life of a red blood cell may be less than three months.</p>
<p>The number of red blood cells often increases with infection - incorrect. It is white blood cells that increase with infection. Many infections, especially streptococcal infections, reduce the number of red blood cells.</p>
<p>More red blood cells are produced than the body needs - correct. The number of newly formed blood cells is usually greater than the number that permanently exists. When a child's life begins, red blood cells are destroyed to prepare to store iron in the liver.</p>
<p>Paleness is often a symptom of anemia - incorrect. While paleness may be a cause of anemia, not all pale people are necessarily anemic. Many people have sufficient red blood cells and hemoglobin, but still appear pale because their blood vessels cannot bring blood to the surface of the skin. In many people, red blood cells must be reduced by almost 50 percent before the paleness of anemia can be detected.</p>
<p>Anemia has no symptoms - incorrect. In non-pernicious anemia cases, symptoms such as weakness and fatigue are often discovered after a short period of time. Mild anemia often results in shortness of breadth, heart murmur, swelling of the feet and ankles, and headaches. Severe anemia is sometimes caused by numbness, enlargement of the abdomen, deafness, pale or yellow skin, and enlargement of the fingertips.</p>
<p>A naturally cold person is probably anemic on average - correct. A lack of red blood may increase sensitivity to low temperatures.</p>
<p>If a person is anemic, it can be judged by the redness of the corners of their eyes and mouth - incorrect. If the anemia is severe, there may be a significant loss of pigmentation. But strong suspicion is not completely reliable.</p>
<p>The correct way to diagnose anemia is a blood count - correct. An accurate blood count can determine the occurrence and extent of anemia, as well as its symptoms or the lack of red blood cells. This is the only diagnostic method.</p>
<p>The biggest cause of anemia is the lack of iron in the diet - correct. It must be remembered that the cause of anemia is iron deficiency - often referred to as secondary anemia, or nutritional anemia - which is commonly seen. There are twelve different types. Anemia is caused by severe infections. Diseases such as pernicious anemia, hemorrhagic anemia,　disease, hookworm disease, and syphilis are a few types, not caused by iron deficiency.</p>
<p>Anemia in pregnant women may transmit the disease to the child - correct. The child's body relies on the mother's supply of iron and other essential components to form red blood cells. A child born to an anemic mother may not be anemic at birth, but without sufficient iron reserves in his body, he may become ill in the first year of his life.</p>
<p>Mothers who are not anemic do not have anemic children - incorrect. Special anemia may be transmitted by non-anemic mothers. This is due to genetic factors, not inappropriate diet or recklessness. It is entirely due to the causes of pregnancy. This type of formation is found in the Mediforranean race. Another cause, called erythroblastic anemia, has not been discovered until recently. Blood transfusions in childhood can usually suppress these hereditary anemias.</p>
<p>If a child drinks only milk, he will not be anemic - incorrect. Although milk contains very small amounts of iron, this life element is still rare in milk. Newborns often need enough iron to meet their needs. However, unless foods containing iron are adequately supplied within eight or nine months after birth, anemia may be discovered.</p>
<p>To prevent anemia, liver must be used in food - correct. Liver contains the essential substances to inhibit pernicious anemia and prevent anemia in middle age or old age. However, this one food should not be needed alone. But no matter what, liver is a good food rich in iron.</p>
<p>Foods that are easy to provide to prevent anemia are those with iron - correct. Foods that actually have iron include all grains, egg yolks, liver, lean meat, garden peas, beans, dates, prunes, raisins, rhubarb, soybeans, spinach, and turnips, green vegetables, mustard greens, and beets, vegetables, cauliflower, cabbage, bean sprouts, asparagus, potatoes, and fruits are also rich in iron.</p>
<p>Spinach can be used in every food because it is a food that prevents anemia - incorrect. When spinach contains iron, substances present in green leafy foods will not force children to eat.</p>

<h3>Three-Character Classic on Typhoid Fever</h3>
<p>— Shou Wuqing</p>
<p>The weather is currently out of balance, with uncertain sunny and rainy days. It is suddenly sunny and bright, and suddenly overcast and surging. Although acute epidemics are rare, infections with typhoid fever, according to clinical observations, have increased rather than decreased. Moreover, typhoid fever is mostly the typical type and less often the atypical type, so the course of the disease is quite long. I have jokingly written a "Three-Character Classic on Typhoid Fever" to provide children with reading material, which is not without benefit for promoting summer hygiene.</p>
<p>Typhoid fever, infectious disease. All children, have heard of it.</p>
<p>Easy to contract, be careful. Long illness, truly harmful.　High fever, takes much effort. Do not delay, it's most important.</p>
<p>Has bacteria, like rods. With cilia, very agile.　From the mouth, enters. Dirty flies, act as matchmakers.</p>
<p>Incubation period, takes two weeks. At first, observe fever closely.</p>
<p>Cold does not subside, heat does not clear. Sweating, like malaria.</p>
<p>Taking white medicine, won't be effective. Has cough, mostly nasal discharge.</p>
<p>Often constipated, or diarrhea. Porridge soup, difficult to take.　Develops white fur, red rash. Only sleeps, often moans.　Intestinal bleeding, complications. Intestinal perforation, very scary.</p>
<p>Three weeks, illness lessens. Wants food, escapes death.</p>
<p>Skin and bones, skinny and clean. Lacks blood, like a ghost.</p>
<p>Looking at it, truly frightening. Glucose, given by injection.</p>
<p>Vitamins, quickly take. Quickly recover, slowly get up.</p>
<p>Advise siblings, pay attention to hygiene. Often wash hands, kill flies.</p>
<p>Be moderate in diet, guard against calamity. Remember carefully, ward off all diseases!</p>
<p>(Note) White medicine is the common name for quinine powder.</p>
<h3>More on Calcium-Vitamin C Compound</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Since I raised this issue in the fourth issue of this publication, I have seen the high opinions expressed by Mr. Shen, Mr. Wu, and Mr. Zhu in the 10th, 13th, 15th, and 16th issues one after another, opening the door to research and contributing to the path. The merits of all gentlemen are truly undeniable!</p>
<p>This issue is of great importance. It not only has its rights and wrongs in academic terms, but also affects medical treatment. My personal prejudice is trivial, but the interests of patients are great. I must speak my mind frankly. "How can I be fond of argument? I have no choice!"</p>
<p>(1) The theory of prohibiting acid is not consistent. For decades, there have been advocates for and against it, each holding different views, each with reasons, each with teachers, and each with schools of thought. The competition between factions is not a one-day affair. I follow Sergent's theory, believing that patients with progressive tuberculosis have a high calcium deficiency and need even more calcium. Since acid overcomes calcium, the theory of prohibiting acid is of course a reasonable theory during calcium treatment. As for Mr. Wang's statement that "gastric juice is inherently acidic," the orally administered calcium has already been affected by it, and there is no need to prohibit acid, which is already the case. However, it is not known that before taking calcium supplements, it is necessary to drink a cup of antacid water to neutralize gastric juice, so that gastric acid cannot play its role, and to achieve the purpose of calcium therapy. Why is this? Furthermore, oral medications containing calcium and vitamin C are rarely seen among foreign proprietary medicines. As far as I know, there are only calcium-vitamin D compounds, such as Calcipot D. As for calcium-vitamin C compounds, only a certain Leaf factory in China began to produce Calcivit C to meet the needs of doctors in our country. Why is this? Taking a broad view of Mr. Wang's theory of not prohibiting acid, it also has considerable reasons. If there is a public experimental proof, I would not hesitate to abandon Sergent's theory and "completely abandon his learning and learn from it."</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Shen stated that "tuberculosis is certain to lack calcium," advocating that all tuberculosis patients should be treated with calcium. I dare not agree with this point. Tuberculosis is a polymorphic disease. Some patients lack calcium, and some do not. In fibrotic and calcified tuberculosis, calcium in the lesions has reached saturation. If calcium is injected again, it will inevitably be "excreted out of the body" as Mr. Shen said. Then, the injection is equal to no injection. Even if there is no great harm, there is no benefit. Is this why Mr. Shen has been doing this for "two or three years" without much effect?</p>
<p>(3) Elderly tuberculosis is mostly a stubborn chronic disease, and progressive activity is in the minority. Whether or not to inject calcium should be determined based on the patient. If calcium is administered regardless of the disease type, it is almost blind.</p>
<p>In short, this issue cannot be resolved by empty words. We must carry out: (A) autopsies to examine the lesions of bodies that have taken or injected calcium-vitamin C compounds. (1) Are there any insoluble calcium lumps? (2) If there are calcium lumps, what kind of calcium salt do they belong to?</p>
<p>(B) Animal experiments. Take several guinea pigs, make them tuberculous, and then administer calcium-vitamin C compound and pure calcium for comparison.</p>
<p>(C) Clinical experiments. Divide tuberculosis patients into two groups, one group injected with calcium-vitamin C compound and the other group injected with pure calcium. At the same time, the diet should prohibit acid, and examine the urine for calcium excretion and compare the amount of excretion.</p>
<p>In this way, the truth can be made clear to the world. What do you three gentlemen, Shen, Wu, and Wang, think?</p>
<h3>Preventing Yellow Fever!</h3>
<p>— Chai Te-lin</p>
<p>On the sixth floor of a large building on Euston Road in London, five young men in white coats were working diligently, whispering softly, producing a yellow powder. This building is the location of the Wellcome Tropical Medicine Research Institute, a crucial command center in the battle against various deadly tropical diseases. The yellow powder these young men were producing is a vaccine, arguably humanity's first line of defense against yellow fever.</p>
<p>Our prevention of yellow fever transmission relies on injecting this live virus—a wondrous pathogenic entity somewhere between living and non-living, invisible to ordinary optical microscopes. However, while both yellow fever vaccination and smallpox inoculation involve living organisms, there are significant differences. The smallpox vaccine is taken from cows, and inoculation results in cowpox. The virus used for the yellow fever vaccine, on the other hand, has been cultured and propagated for years in the Euston Road laboratory. The initial trace of the virus has been artificially reproduced thousands of times, as only laboratory cultivation can produce enough virus to meet demand. The viral strain used by the Wellcome Institute and other laboratories around the world is called "17D," a mutation and fortuitous product of the original viral strain.</p>
<p>Part of the story of this viral strain involves Asibi, a native of the British Gold Coast. Twenty years ago, a British-American expedition studying yellow fever in Africa obtained some virus specimens from Asibi, who was infected with the disease. Laboratories in both Britain and the United States then began research. One day, an unusual development was observed in the American laboratory culturing the Asibi virus: the virus (when injected into monkeys) no longer caused illness. It had lost its ability to cause yellow fever, although it retained the ability to provide lasting immunity. Not long ago, the British colonial government, recognizing Asibi's donation of the virus as beneficial to humanity, awarded him a pension.</p>
<p>Manufacturing this vaccine takes sixteen days, and a total of three weeks is required, including the final testing, before it can be stored and used. Ordinary chicken eggs are crucial to the manufacturing process. The Wellcome Institute uses over a thousand eggs per month, an average of 268 per week, sourced from farms in Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey.</p>
<p>The Wellcome Institute starts manufacturing new batches of vaccine twice a week, each time producing several batches. After the eggs arrive from the farms or suppliers, they are incubated at a temperature of 102-3 degrees Fahrenheit for nine days to allow the embryos to develop. On the ninth day, the eggs are removed from the incubator and inspected against a light source using a specially designed machine. Non-viable eggs are discarded immediately, and the remaining ones are inoculated with the yellow fever virus.</p>
<p>During inoculation, the atmosphere in the laboratory resembles that of an operating room. The one performing the inoculation is senior technical assistant Mr. Green. He was awarded the British Empire Medal for his contributions to vaccine production. When inoculating, he wears a transparent mask to prevent contamination from the eggs. The surface of the eggs is also wiped with alcohol, resulting in a strong odor of disinfectant in the air. The hypodermic needles used for injection are replaced every three eggs to minimize the number of contaminated eggs in case a needle becomes contaminated.</p>
<p>The injection takes one second per egg. He deftly inserts the needle with a downward pressure of his finger, injecting one-tenth of a cubic centimeter of the virus into each egg. On average, each egg injected in this way can produce enough doses for a hundred people. Sometimes one egg yields as many as two hundred doses. The eggs are then placed back in the incubator for three or four days to allow the virus to continue to grow within the embryos. (See attached illustration.)</p>
<p>On the twelfth or thirteenth day, the embryos are removed from the eggshells, ground up with water, and the resulting mixture is placed in test tubes. They are then spun rapidly in a centrifuge to allow the larger particles to settle to the bottom of the tube, leaving a layer of cloudy, brownish liquid above, which is the vaccine. This vaccine must then be tested to see if it is contaminated with bacteria.</p>
<p>Up to this point, every step is a race against time, because the virus is an extremely fragile organism that is at risk of dying at any moment before the liquid is dried and turned into powder. Even after it becomes powder, it can only be preserved for one or two months and must be kept at the proper temperature, not exceeding four degrees Celsius. That is why the vaccine is sent out from the laboratory packaged in insulated bottles containing ice or in boxes containing dry ice.</p>
<p>In the vaccine manufacturing process, it only becomes a powder on the sixteenth day. This is achieved by first placing the liquid into small glass tubes, freezing them, and then using a drying method.</p>
<p>But before this batch of vaccine can be used, one problem must be solved: the crucial issue of dosage. Exactly how much is needed to achieve an immunizing effect? In other words, how much virus does this batch of vaccine contain? Therefore, the powder must be diluted with thousands of times its original water content and then tested. Based on the results of this test, the strength of the virus in each batch of vaccine can be determined.</p>
<p>The manufactured vaccine resembles large yellow pills. When used, it must be dissolved in distilled water and injected into the human body. The injection only takes a few minutes, but after the injection, 90 to 95 percent of people will be completely immune to yellow fever for at least four years.</p>
<h3>Eggs in the Incubator</h3>
<p>Eggs are incubated for nine days, and non-viable eggs are discarded. The remaining eggs are injected with the yellow fever virus and placed in the incubator for another three or four days before the embryos are removed from the eggshells. If left to hatch naturally, they would hatch into chicks in another eight days. (Photo courtesy of the British Information Service)</p>

<h3>Little Raindrops</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>It's all because the flower season is too fleeting; even if one doesn't love flowers, one still pauses before the flower-selling girl.</p>
<p>The young, naive flower-selling girl smiles expectantly at people.</p>
<p>"This one," she picks up a bunch of deep red, half-open flowers—roses; she asks, "Do you want it?"</p>
<p>"Um—? Want, don't want..." I'm staring intently at the pink wall over there, the wisteria in someone's yard, blooming so profusely? Perhaps the branches are delicate and soft; a cluster has been blown down by the wind, falling on the ground outside the wall...</p>
<p>"Do you want it or not?" She raises the flowers in her hand a little higher; the shadows of the roses are reflected on her face; she also has a flower-like youth, but she doesn't know it. She just wants to exchange the flowers for money to buy rice, so a distressed anxiety appears on her face.</p>
<p>I nod, telling her that I want them.</p>
<p>The cheeks shadowed by the roses then gain a comforting smile.</p>
<p>As she hands me the roses, I ask her to pick up that sprig of wisteria lying on the road.</p>
<p>She's a little surprised, but happily does it; she also says with a grin: "Do you even like the flowers at the foot of the wall?"</p>
<p>"Why not?..." But I don't say it out loud.</p>
<p>She laughs at how silly I am, and I pity how silly she is...</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Summer gradually matures. Another year of flowers, leaves, nightingales, thrushes—</p>
<p>Green darkens and red thins; don't you dislike the transience of spring?</p>
<p>A friend returning from the South asks: "Tell me, do you love fiery July?"</p>
<p>I nod casually at her.</p>
<p>She laughs: "What in this season makes you most fascinated?"</p>
<p>"Watching lotuses blossom, listening to rain hitting banana leaves," I think for a moment: "Also, the cool breeze at night, the artful clouds in the sky, the croaking of frogs in the pond, the cicadas on the high branches..."</p>
<p>"Hmm," she ponders: "People who have lived in Jiangnan for a long time will appreciate these gentle, leisurely beauties."</p>
<p>"What? Don't you think these are the most lovable?" Her words make me feel lost.</p>
<p>"I love the blazing sun, hurricanes, torrential rain, lightning, and thunder."</p>
<p>"Isn't it a bit too stimulating?" I laugh: "You didn't used to be like this; a not-too-long trip has brought you the passion of the South."</p>
<p>She smiles calmly and asks: "Don't you think that stimulating, symbolizing the passion of life, isn't better than gentle peace?"</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>On a clear, moonlit midsummer night, in a quiet, brightly lit room, we were silently facing each other.</p>
<p>She suddenly felt melancholy.</p>
<p>"On such a beautiful night, even if there's something sad, it should be temporarily forgotten," I advise her.</p>
<p>"Forgotten?" She raises her sorrowful eyes: "Unless the seas turn into mulberry fields."</p>
<p>"Ah, why do you always have so much longing for the past, which can never return? That's not very good, I think."</p>
<p>"I think so too," she says softly: "But it's more than just longing."</p>
<p>"What else is it?"</p>
<p>"Maybe it's indignation? Even I... can't figure it out."</p>
<p>"Indignation?" I ask in surprise, raising my head to look at her.</p>
<p>She nods, adding: "Indignation over the death of a friend."</p>
<p>"A good friend, right? He died too tragically and too young," I sigh.</p>
<p>"And died too ordinarily," she explains: "So I will never be able to forget, I will always be indignant for him, until I die, I will carry this endless sorrow into the grave."</p>
<p>"You loved him?"</p>
<p>"Please don't say that," she answers solemnly: "I don't cling to the past because of love, but because of his death, I hate—"</p>
<p>"I understand what you mean; you regret his death—a promising young man meeting an unnamed sacrifice; you are eternally indignant."</p>
<p>"Yes, an eagle must never die like a crow; how can a furious horse not die on the battlefield?" She raises her head slightly, lifting her dangerous and thoughtful eyes: "How can a hero-like person not have a heroic death?"</p>
<p>"How can a hero-like person not have a heroic death?" I deliberately repeat her words, telling our hero among friends, and all the friends of heroes!</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>I have never thought about how to arrange my own tomb, or recalled the death of a most intimate friend.</p>
<p>However, once—</p>
<p>"If a best friend died," he asked me: "How would you commemorate him?"</p>
<p>"It wouldn't be you, would it?"</p>
<p>"Maybe it would be me!"</p>
<p>"If it were you, then," I thought for a moment: "I would go to your cemetery without interruption, offering a bunch of yellow tulips, or cold, beautiful white peonies; if it were a snowy, windy, bitterly cold day, I would definitely bring a sprig of elegant winter plum..."</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>"Do you dislike it?" I give him a puzzled glance; "Aren't these all the things you love?"</p>
<p>"Those are what I loved when I was alive, but not necessarily what I need after death," he says solemnly.</p>
<p>"Yes, I also have to tell them to decorate your lonely tomb with evergreen pines and cypresses—"</p>
<p>"No, no," he interrupts me: "I didn't think about needing a grave."</p>
<p>"Ah, I understand," I realize with a start: "As Ms. Bing Xin said, on a clear, moonlit night, bury the remains at the bottom of the ocean—I guessed right?"</p>
<p>He laughs brightly: "Hmm, a poet's idea; actually, the seabed may not be able to sleep peacefully, and perhaps you can't even see coral..."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"..." I'm at a loss, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>"Can't you think of anything else? You confused person, do you remember a saying: Our graves are not on the ground, but in people's hearts."</p>
<p>"You mean," I exclaim: "I'll forget you? No, no, that's absolutely impossible; I remember you, forever, forever."</p>
<p>"I think, I hope so too," he says as if murmuring to himself: "Haven't you said? The strongest memory of mankind is God's most cruel arrangement."</p>
<p>"Thank God for such an arrangement," he laughs. Both joyful and melancholic: "And thank you; you know? Being able to forget is the happiest thing, but being forgotten is the most unfortunate thing..."</p>
<p>—That's right, living in people's memories is the most beautiful grave, better than eternal life! Don't you think so?</p>
<h3>New Words from a Green Window</h3>
<p>— Zizhen</p>
<p>The "New Words from a Green Window," a collection of legendary writings, was very popular in the Ming Dynasty, as can be seen from various book lists. It enjoyed the same popularity as the "Unofficial History of Yu Chu," falsely attributed to Tang Xianzu (actually written by Ling Xingde under a pseudonym), and the "Collection of Beautiful Women," attributed to Wang Shizhen (suspected to have been written by Ling Chu's brothers). All three books contain legendary writings, with the "Taiping Guangji" being a major source for them. The latter two are later in date, so they also include works from the Ming Dynasty, while the "New Words from a Green Window" does not contain any works from after the Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>In the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Chao Li of Kaizhou compiled the "Shiwentang Book List" ("Peiping Library Monthly," Volume 3, Issue 2), which lists "New Tales from a Green Window" in the category of miscellaneous writings. This is indeed the book in question. He also lists "Records of the Green Window" as a separate book, seemingly another work. During the Wanli period, Zhu Muxue's "Wanjuanlou Book List" ("Yujianzhai Books") Volume 3 also listed: "New Words from a Green Window, Four Volumes." Neither book list mentions the compiler, so it is unknown by whose hand it was compiled. The recent "Shubo Yongtan" Volume 4 records a manuscript copy seen at the Hososawa shop in Japan, titled: "Compiled by the Master of Imperial Capital Romance." Also, Xiang's "Eight Thousand Volume Building Book List" in Qiantang during the Qing Dynasty also listed this book. Half of the Eight Thousand Volume Building's collection was acquired by the National Academy of Sciences Library in Panlongli, Nanjing. It is unknown whether this book was among them; even if it was once stored there, it is now unknown whether it still exists. In addition, the Liu family of Nanxun also had a copy in their Jia Ye Tang collection, but its current whereabouts are also unknown. Unfortunately, all three copies held domestically and abroad are currently inaccessible; all that can be seen is the full table of contents of the book transcribed in "Shubo Yongtan."</p>
<p>Although the original book is not available, its date of completion can still be roughly determined. In the first volume of Luo Ye's "Drunken Old Man's Talks" from the Song and Yuan Dynasties (Japanese photoprint edition), the "Preface to the Tongue-Plowing Narrative" discusses storytellers of fiction, saying:</p>
<p>"...In youth, he studied the 'Taiping Guangji'; in adulthood, he attacked historical books of past dynasties; the legendary tales of powder and rouge were stored within his heart; knowledge of romance and beauty only resided above the mundane; he perused 'Yijianzhi' without exception, and mastered all that was recorded in the 'Xiuyingji'; no hidden secret escaped the 'Dongshan Laughing Grove'; he returned to the 'New Tales from a Green Window' as a basis."</p>
<p>Since it is listed alongside the "Yijianzhi" and predates the "Drunken Old Man's Talks," and contains no works from after the Song Dynasty, then its date of completion should be in the Southern Song, and the compiler was a resident of the Southern Song capital, Lin'an.</p>
<p>After this book was compiled and published, it also underwent changes. In Yuan Yang Chaoying's "Taiping Yuefu" Volume 7, the Yue Tiao tune "Quail Suite," the opening song of Zhou Zhongbin's "Ode to Little Qing" says:</p>
<p>Releasing the scroll, picking up the lamp, I now view the ancients, hating the wind, burying the clouds, resenting the rain. Because of viewing the surviving writings of Jindou, therefore, 'New Words from a Green Window' was created. Considering it, there are windows within; it's good that there are also tea merchants, it's good that there are also able literati.</p>
<p>According to Zhou's song, the subject is the love affair between the Song courtesan Su Qing (Little Qing) and the scholar Shuang Jian, and the merchant Feng Kui. The original story can be found in Mei Dingzuo's "Qingni Lotus Flower Record" Volume 7 in Ming Dynasty. The Song musician Zhang Wuniu had various palace tunes, and there were also many Yuan dramas that used this story as material. Jindou is Jindou County in Luzhou, the birthplace of Little Qing, hence the name. "'Jie Window New Words' should refer to this book. It is credible that the Yuan Dynasty would have also included the story of Little Qing in 'New Master from a Green Window,' and this story was exactly what the Yuan people liked to sing about the most (there are many in Yuan Sanqu). However, the extant Japanese collection does not contain this record, which should be because the manuscript copy used the Song printed edition as its source, so it was not included; and this matter is only seen in the Yuan people's 'Supplemented' edition. Secondly, the book titles are also inconsistent: the manuscript copy and Zhou Zhongbin's song and the 'Wanjuanlou Book List' use 'New Words from a Green Window'; while the 'Drunken Old Man's Talks' and the 'Baowentang Book List' use 'New Tales from a Green Window.' There may be some clerical errors, but that may not be the main reason; it is likely that the original was divergent like this, and the two characters are similar in form and meaning, so they are easily confused. However, the two should be the same book, there seems to be no doubt.</p>
<p>The more than one hundred legendary titles recorded in this book also give us many insights: The "Biography of Zheng Delin" according to this book and the "Guangji of Annual Customs," we know comes from the Tang Dynasty Pei Xing's "Legend," sufficient to correct the Ming Dynasty Lu Ji's error in the "Ancient and Modern Collection of Sayings." "Jin Yan's Spring Outing Meets Niang" (from "Yanyu Fiction") and the "Qingshi" compared, is the "Jin Zhuang Spring Outing" in the "Drunken Old Man's Talks." "Yang Ai'ai Did Not Marry Her Second Husband" (from Su Zimei's essay, but the current "Collection of Su Scholar" does not contain it), is what the story "Ai Ai Ci" is based on, "Cui Bao's Praise Xue Qiong Playing the Zither" (derived from "Yiqing Collection"), is also seen in "Guangji of Annual Customs," which is what Bai Pu's "Xue Qiong's Moonlight Night Zither Lament," Zheng Dehui's "Cui Huaibao Hears the Zither on a Moonlit Night" two miscellaneous dramas and Yuan Dynasty Southern drama "Cui Huaibao" are based on.</p>
<h3>The Annunciation</h3>
<p>— El Greco</p>
<p>El Greco (1545-1614) was originally Greek, but because he lived in Spain for a long time and laid the foundation for Spanish art, most historians include him in the history of Spanish art.</p>
<p>He was a religious believer, and his works mostly used religious myths as themes. They are solemn and powerful, and he was good at using colors and symbolizing things with colors. Although the figures he made were mostly exaggerated, they did not make people feel strange or uneasy. This style directly influenced modern times.</p>
<p>"The Annunciation" is one of his most famous works. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Past Events</h3>
<p>— Lotus Seed</p>
<p>Although I have never seen the vast ocean, water always fills me with too much love. I envy its freedom, because when it is annoyed, it can vent its anger with surging waves; unlike me, who has to hide my original kind soul all day long, floating cautiously in the wind and dust of the people; even in times of sorrow, I am not allowed to shed a single tear with relief.</p>
<p>I remember once in the countryside, I accompanied my mother on a small boat to visit a distant relative. Because of the long journey, we set off almost still under the cover of darkness, pushing aside the low-hanging treetops on both sides of the narrow river surface. Just as dawn was breaking, the boat had already sailed onto the wide river surface at the foot of Dushan Mountain. The river was as calm as an old nun's mood, without a trace of worldly ripples. The morning sun had just revealed half of its red face, dyeing the water all over with golden red. In the clear water, I could clearly see the strands of aquatic plants and the large and small fish swimming in groups among them. The boat glided over the tops of the aquatic plants, and the fish secretly kissed the edges of the boat submerged in the water; I stared wide-eyed at all this, doubting that I was swimming in a dream.</p>
<p>On the sandbars in the river, pairs of gulls were washing each other's feathers. Some had finished their morning lessons and were frolicking in the air, while occasionally one or two solitary gulls stood alone by the water, stretching their necks as if waiting for their lost companions to return.</p>
<p>At this moment, a pair of gulls hovered above me, and I deeply wished them happiness and freedom. Suddenly, a gunshot struck one of them, instantly taking its precious life. It fell from the sky, while the other fled with a cry of sorrow. Watching this cruel scene, I couldn't help but cry out, and my mother in the cabin hurriedly called out to reassure me, thinking I was startled by the gunshot. But how could she know her daughter's feelings? Looking up at the sky where the tragedy had occurred, with tears in my eyes, I lamented for a long time. I pitied the unfortunate encounter of the gull who had met with disaster, but I even more regretted the fate of the surviving gull. From now on, in how much longing and sorrow would it recall its never-returning lover? In how much loneliness and desolation would it gaze at its own reflection and spend these sorrowful days?</p>
<p>Why are humans so cruel? Don't they deserve the right to be together freely? I was saddened.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Shakespeare</h3>
<p>— Oriental Mist</p>
<p>When Shakespeare had not yet become a famous poet and playwright, he once competed with the comedian Jonson on the London stage. However, sometimes the performance of Jonson's comedy could not even cover the reception fees; while the characters created by Shakespeare, as soon as they appeared on stage, the "sold out" sign would immediately be hung high at the door of the theater.</p>
<p>However, Jonson not only did not feel jealous, resentful, or complaining, but instead greatly admired Shakespeare. Once, when Shakespeare's play was published, Jonson actually compared him with the great writers of Greece, Rome, and all ages, and also wrote a poem:</p>
<p>"England, you have a poet to be proud of! The theater scene of Europe depends on his holy achievements and miracles. He is not a scholar of a temporary moment, but a literary dragon for all ages."</p>
<p>It is said that Shakespeare was very afraid during his lifetime that his tomb would be dug up by others after his death. Therefore, he firmly refused to be buried in Westminster Abbey after his death, and also personally wrote such an epitaph, engraved on his tombstone:</p>
<p>"Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear,</p>
<p>To dig the dust enclosed here.</p>
<p>Blessed be the man that spares these stones,</p>
<p>And cursed be he that moves my bones."</p>
<p>Don't underestimate the power of this short inscription. Legend has it that later, those who wanted to take a look at Shakespeare's remains were all frightened by it.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 339</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"One." Mr. W shook his head; "That's only referring to the Nankou side… The central government received our report from this side,… and of course, there were other on-the-spot investigation reports, like Mr. Dai personally going to the Northeast some time ago, and so on… The central government got this information, so it urgently instructed Jin Yan to transfer generals to defend Nankou… Nankou is the throat of the northwest, if you block it, you can stabilize half of the country; if you attack, you can shake the main force of the Japanese invaders going south. It's a most important location…"</p>
<p>"But the central government's instruction to defend Nankou, although it was extremely urgent, was received by Jin Yan; because this tiger's den area had already been assigned to Jin Yan's responsibility. The instruction was delayed a bit in Yan's hands, considering personnel selection, and so on." By the time Tang Enbo received this instruction, it was already half past midnight on July 30th. Fortunately, Tang's troops moved quickly, and within a few hours, they rushed to Nankou between midnight on the 31st and after 0:00 on August 1st, and arranged the defensive line to seize and block; Tang's main army also rushed from Suidong and set up the headquarters in Huailai…"</p>
<p>"On the same day, almost at the same time, the Japanese army decided to launch a major offensive in Pingjin and Pinghan before August 5th, as a response to the 'August Secret'; on the one hand, Itagaki still transferred troops to follow the original plan and take the PingSui line to meet the Japanese army advancing south from Zhangbei. Who knew that just as he reached Changping, our army had already taken the lead in Nankou's strategic location and made almost all of the necessary arrangements. When I say 'five parts fortune, five parts luck,' that's what I'm referring to… Think about such an important place, if the Japanese army had arrived first…"</p>
<p>"The Juyongguan Nankou area is one of the nine major fortresses in our country. Considering how serious the situation is in the Pingjin area, even if the central government didn't receive intelligence, shouldn't they have paid attention?…" I interjected, asking Mr. W.</p>
<p>"Of course there were defense forces, but they were pitifully small." When Mr. W said this, he couldn't help but shake his head and sigh: "………In short, it's a personnel problem!………" Mr. W was silent for a while, as if he was trying to suppress his impulsive emotions; then he suddenly woke up from his absent-minded state and turned around: "………Let's discuss how to cross Nankou." He pointed to the military map spread out on the table, showing it to me:</p>
<p>"Assuming you get to Changping, that's the end point of the '15th' method of action. Going further west, of course, is the front line of the two armies, and all means of transportation, except horses, are probably impassable. You have to walk or ride a horse… But look—" Mr. W pointed to the map: "Nankou's terrain faces southeast and sits on the northwest; the Juyongguan and the Great Wall act as a screen in the back. The western side of Nankou, starting from Shuanglingkou, is all continuous mountains and high ridges, and the eastern side, starting from Ma'anshan, is also layer upon layer of high peaks, stretching for dozens of miles; so only this narrow passage in the front can be used for transportation…"</p>
<p>"I understand." I knew what Mr. W meant. At this time, if I wanted to go to Zhangbei along the PingSui Road to search for those little tigers, I could only go as far as Changping at most. Since Nankou was already defended, ordinary people were naturally cut off from going back and forth, and they couldn't fly over even with wings; unless they took a risk and passed through the "no man's land" and safely found our army's outposts, they would advance using the method that Mr. W was about to arrange for me. But in this "no man's land," the outposts of both armies could shoot at any time; it would be difficult to pass safely. Mr. W had already seen this point.</p>
<p>"Listen!" Mr. W didn't let me interrupt him: "………The front line of Nankou probably directly reaches the gate of the fortress called Pingzhang, a high ground called Longhukou, or Longhutai. It's still about three to five miles from Changping to here. I have no information here about the situation on this three-to-five-mile stretch of road, so I can't guess. This………"</p>

<h3>"A Century of Planning"</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>Because of the unrest in all aspects, it directly affects the academic and educational circles, making them deeply infected with a state of disturbance and unease in both work and life.</p>
<p>The other day, we saw celebrations from all sides for a university professor who had been teaching for 25 years, which is worthy of celebration; but it may not be easy to ask an elementary school teacher to persevere for 25 years under the current living conditions.</p>
<p>We are not discouraged for the education community. We believe that professors and teachers in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools should be given an environment and state of mind that allows them to teach with peace of mind. That means not disturbing these physically and mentally exhausted educators with anxious emotions.</p>
<p>There is an old Chinese saying, called "a century to cultivate people," which means that it is not a matter of one day or one night to get a good education; and the responsibility of this "century to cultivate people" falls on the shoulders of educators.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we see the City Elementary School Principals Association petitioning the Education Bureau, and the University Professors Association making demands to the Ministry of Education, all of them repeatedly asking to guarantee their positions and issue appointment letters quickly, so that they can work with peace of mind, this voice sounds so sad and heartbreaking now!</p>
<p>Education is "a plan for a century," we must ensure that it is not affected by any fluctuations or interference, so that education specialists can teach and research at the same time, so that the desolate and barren education garden can thrive from now on, that will be the gospel of the Chinese nation.</p>

<h3>Diplomacy in the Early Southern Song Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>Reports state that Supervisor So-and-so and others have filed an impeachment against Wang Shijie for his weak diplomacy towards the Soviet Union, and it has been approved by the President of the Yuan for investigation and establishment. Wang's personal merits and demerits to the country are set aside for the moment, but in short, a diplomat is restricted internally by national policies and responds externally to international changes. His every word and action may not all come from his own heart, and even if they do, they may not be beneficial to the overall situation. The evolution of diplomacy to this day is no longer the era of "Zichan having eloquent words, which the country relied on." In that case, the strength or weakness of the attitude towards the Soviet Union, the central government has already decided in advance, and the Soviet Union has used this as an excuse afterward. Wang's personal actions are merely to implement it in a roundabout way. What merits or demerits are there?</p>
<p>Recently, reading the History of the Song Dynasty, I feel that the diplomacy in the early Southern Song Dynasty is similar to that of today. I will briefly compare them below to accord with the purpose of learning from the past to know the future.</p>
<p>The so-called "early Southern Song Dynasty" here refers to the four generations of Emperor Gaozong, Xiaozong, Guangzong, and Ningzong. Its diplomatic object is not as complex as it is today. Liao had already fallen, and Yuan had not yet risen. Those who talked about peace or war only referred to the Jin people in the north.</p>
<p>Initially, Prince Kang Gou crossed south and ascended the throne in Jiankang, appointing Li Gang as the Prime Minister and Zong Ze defending Bian. At that time, there was quite a desire to restore the Central Plains. When Huang Qianshan and Wang Boyan were in power, the emperor was confused by them, so he went south to Lin'an to avoid the Jin's attacks. However, the two countries were in a state of war, and the relationship between the two sides was not yet determined. Earlier, when Bianjing was in crisis, Emperor Qinzong, for the sake of temporary peace, signed a treaty with Jin, with the Jin ruler and the Song subject, paying a certain amount of silver and silk each year, called tribute. When Emperor Gaozong ascended the throne, Jin again demanded tribute. At first, Emperor Gaozong was forced by public opinion to reluctantly discuss war, but later he appointed Qin Hui to vigorously advocate peace. It is known that before Shaoxing, Song and Jin were enemy countries, but after the peace treaty was signed, the relationship changed to that of ruler and subject. The history records that Wang Lun led the Jin envoys back in the name of notifying Jiangnan, saying that if Song yielded, the Empress Dowager could be restored, the coffin could be returned, Emperor Huizong could return, and the Central Plains could be obtained. Prime Minister Qin Hui and Sun Jin and others all agreed with peace. All those who opposed the peace talks were first to kill Yue Fei and Zhang Jun, and then to dismiss Zhao Ding and demote Hu Quan. For a time, public opinion was unified, as if there was no diplomacy to follow other than showing peace.</p>
<p>Emperor Xiaozong resolutely took it upon himself to restore the country, appointing Yu Yunwen and Liu Qi as Prime Ministers, and allied with Jin. However, he was defeated by Mian. At that time, the Jin ruler Shizong was known as a wise ruler, so there was no opportunity for either side to take advantage of. As a result, the soldiers were withdrawn and peace was negotiated. Song was the nephew, and Jin was the uncle, abolishing the etiquette of the ruler and subject, and meeting as allied countries. Contemporary discussions praised it as the restoration. Emperor Guangzong succeeded to the throne, and there was no war, the same as Emperor Xiaozong.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Ningzong, the hardliners were revived. Han Tuozhou was the Prime Minister, ambitious and eager to show off his military power. Therefore, he requested to posthumously confer Yue Fei, decreed the demotion of Qin Hui, and strongly criticized the loss of the peace treaty. In the early years of Emperor Ningzong, there was an army to attack Jin. Tuozhou himself was the Grand Master, the Prince of Pingyuan, and the Pacifier of Military and National Affairs. For a time, patriotic men of lofty ideals, such as Xin Qiji and others, all advocated supporting him. Unfortunately, Tuozhou was ambitious but lacked talent, unlearned and unskilled, resulting in the army failing to achieve any results and suffering a terrible defeat. The Song people cut off Tuozhou's head and sent it to the Jin army, agreeing to the etiquette of uncle and nephew. As a result, the Song's military strength weakened, and Jin was also exhausted, laying the groundwork for the Yuan people to establish their country in the future.</p>
<p>In general, the diplomatic policies of the above four dynasties were not desirable. War was fruitless, and peace was humiliating. In particular, Emperor Gaozong's bowing down and acknowledging himself as a subject was even more egregious. In the early Southern Song Dynasty, there was too much impetuosity. When they were strong, they rubbed their fists and palms, and when they were weak, they crawled and showed pity. They did not ask about the country's major plans or the right track of diplomacy. Only Emperor Xiaozong's "seeking peace through war" was a relatively stable strategy. Unfortunately, he did not meet the right time, and it was a pity that he could not achieve his ambition.</p>
<p>Today's diplomatic situation is more complex than that of the Southern Song Dynasty. Those who steer the wheel of diplomacy are not able to hide things among one or two senior officials, and being between two great powers often gives them a sense of serving both Qi and Chu. A wrong step can easily lead to unpredictable disasters. So what should we do? I believe that foreign affairs should be foreign affairs, and domestic affairs should be domestic affairs. The two do not necessarily have to affect each other. In extraordinary times, measures should also be extraordinary.</p>
<h3>The Protest of the Sikh People</h3>
<p>— Rong Guan</p>
<p>Goujian suffered a defeat. In order to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, he did not hesitate to use the dignity of the monarch to flatter the King of Wu in a servile manner. On the one hand, he slept on brushwood and tasted gall, and on the other hand, he spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years teaching. As a result, he avenged his humiliation and set an example for future generations of disaster-stricken and prosperous countries.</p>
<p>Today, other ethnic groups have also learned lessons from history and understand this secret. For example, in the struggle for independence in India, a part of the ethnic groups strongly advocated separation, but the vast majority were painfully awaiting the arrival of this split. Just as this division between India and Pakistan is becoming more and more realized, the telegraph has sent out a message that is almost as moving and praiseworthy as sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall:</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd] Indian Sikhs and Indian religious congressmen went on strike on the 3rd to protest the partition. The Sikh people seem to be even more unhappy, because they are almost equally divided between the two countries. Their leaders instructed them to commemorate this day of opposition to the partition in the traditional way, so they ordered everyone not to light lamps, not to sleep on beds, not to use metal utensils, and not to eat on tables. They also put straw on the bed, or put leaves under the dishes, with the intention of not forgetting the pain of the country's division.</p>
<p>Among the arts, the pain of division is most clearly understood by the Polish people. Poland suffered three divisions and two national disasters. Who would not sigh and sigh for its misfortune! However, the Sikh people can foresee the pain of division before it happens, endure hardships, and seek ways to avoid or protest it. As long as they persevere to the end, like Poland, they will still not lose the day of their completion.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Names of the Twelve Months</h3>
<p>— Xifeng</p>
<p>After you know the origin of the names of the seven days of the week, you must also want to know the origin of the names of the twelve months. Now let me give you a simple introduction:</p>
<p>January: is the month of the god Janus. He has two heads, one looking forward and the other looking backward. He is a god of "beginning and ending". January is the beginning of the new year and the end of the old year. All things of the past are as dead as yesterday, and all things of the future are as born as today; the old will be annihilated from now on, and the new will sprout from now on. It is most appropriate to name the beginning of the year with Janus. Janus's job in heaven is to be a gatekeeper, so people also hired him to be the "god of the door".</p>
<p>February: comes from Februa. This is a festival held by the Romans in this month. This "purification festival" is specially set up to worship the god Lupercus. February was originally the last month. It was not until 450 BC that it was changed to the second month. Later, it was changed again, but now it has been restored, but February is still an unstable month, with 28 days in a common year and 29 days in a leap year, with an extra day every four years.</p>
<p>March: is the month of the god of war Mars. He often holds a "terror", "spear", and a shield in one hand. Whenever the ancient Romans went out on an expedition, they would always flatter the gods and predict good or bad luck in front of the gods. The master would carefully offer a small bird imprisoned in a cage, and then test it with a ear of new grain in front of the bird. If the grain was pecked at, it was considered that the battle would be won, and they would immediately swear an oath and set off; otherwise, they would lower the flag and stop the drums. Mars was also worshipped as the "god of all things". The ancient Roman men and women almost made all their decisions based on him, taking his will as their will.</p>
<p>April: is an elegant, intelligent, gentle and kind angel. She followed Mars's bloody, foul-smelling trail, spreading the seeds of joyful peace. The grass revealed its head, and tears of joy blurred its eyes, and the flower buds smiled shyly. The earth was filled with joy, and all things were breeding and growing. April originally meant Opener. In fact, April is indeed the "month of expansion".</p>
<p>May: is the month of the goddess Maia. She is one of the seven daughters of the Hercules Atlas, who carries the earth on his shoulders. She is also the mother of the "god of commerce" Mercury. The Roman god of the gods formed her seven sisters into a Pleiades constellation. She is the dimmest of the seven stars, because she worked hard for her husband Xifu being punished by the gods to carry huge stones, going up and down the mountains all day long, so that she looked depressed and unhappy.</p>
<p>June: is the month to worship the goddess Juno, and some say it is to commemorate the Roman family Junius. The former is Cupid's lovely wife, often swimming in the heavenly palace on a chariot pulled by peacocks. The latter is a beautiful and jealous young lady.</p>
<p>July: Mentioning the name of Julius Caesar is almost universally known. He is not only a brave and good hero, but also a learned and versatile genius. He changed the law, abolished the old calendar, and changed the old calendar, which took March as the beginning of the year and was the fifth month of the year, to July, and named it after his own name. This is because he was born in this month.</p>
<p>August: Augustus's original name was Augustus, the nephew of Caesar. He and Antony and Lepidus dominated Rome. Later, he became emperor and changed his name to Augustus, which means "dignity". August was the month when he made the most achievements. He ended the war and laid the foundation for peace. The Roman golden age also began at this point, writing a splendid page in history. The Romans named August after him to commemorate his great achievements. And in order to avoid jealousy, he specially moved a day from September to August, so that it had 31 days like Caesar's July.</p>
<p>The Romans felt that after Augustus, there were no more great men to name the remaining months. Therefore, the names of the months after August were all the same as before. Because only March was the beginning of the year in the old calendar, September, October, November, and December originally meant the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth months, but now they are expressed as September, October, November, and December according to the new calendar.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Ziyuan</p>
<p>A Night at Lisa's Painting Studio</p>
<p>At the Xiaoshidun Writers Association, I met many writers, poets, and painters. They mentioned a local painter named Liza. Liza had studied painting with famous teachers in France and Italy, and her attainments were quite deep, but after returning to the United States, her work was too sophisticated for the general public, and her art was not sold. Now she has changed her style and focuses on business. She is very busy painting and cannot meet the demand. I am very willing to meet this artist. We made an appointment for a day and accompanied the colleagues of the Writers Association to drive to her residence. It was a one-story house with a living room, dining room, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. The layout was very exquisite. Liza was in her thirties and looked plain, but her speech was very delicate, like a sixteen-year-old girl. I did not see her painting studio throughout the house. When I asked, I learned that the painting studio was set up in the garage. Liza prepared dinner, and after eating, I asked to see her works. She refused, but I insisted, so she reluctantly took out a huge book to show me. Revealing this was the work of an art traitor. The painting was not hand-painted but printed by woodcut. According to Liza, she took the method from ancient Chinese forest carving, but instead of using wooden boards, she used rubber floor tiles. Her cleverness can be seen. She printed the carved portraits on hand towels and tea towels, and then applied colors and inscribed poems. The names were all enchanting and punning. For example, "I don't mean Private, I mean a little privacy" depicts a nude girl talking on the phone with a private 1st class soldier. Another example is Brigadier-general's hot stuff, which is also very vivid. These handkerchiefs and tea towels are mostly sold to Hollywood and women in entertainment venues. Linen ones start at $18 per dozen, and silk ones start at $24 per dozen. Liza earns a lot of money from selling paintings, with a monthly income of thousands of dollars, and her life is very prosperous, but living alone is inevitably a pity. When I was about to leave, she gave me a handkerchief, which turned out to be Brigadier-general's hot stuff. (Can be translated as the Brigadier General's sweetheart) (Sixteen)</p>
<h3>Chen Juan in "Spring Dream"</h3>
<h3>Two Seas</h3>
<p>— By American B. Barton, translated by Xu Tianhong</p>
<p>There are two seas in Palestine.</p>
<p>One is fresh water, in which there are fish, and its banks are decorated with lush green, and trees scatter their branches on it, stretching out their dry roots to suck up its healing waters.</p>
<p>Along its shores, children play, just as "He" (Jesus Christ) was there. "He" loved it. When "He" told his parables, "He" could look out over its silvery waters. On a rolling plain not far away, "He" fed five thousand people with two fish and a few loaves of bread.</p>
<p>The Jordan River made this sea with its dazzling waters from the mountains. People built houses near it, and birds built their nests; all living things are happier because it is there.</p>
<p>The Jordan River continues to flow south and flows into another sea.</p>
<p>Here there is no splashing of fish, no dancing leaves, no singing of birds, no laughter of children. Unless there is something urgent to do, travelers are unwilling to walk through here. The air is heavily shrouded over its waters, and neither man nor beast drinks it.</p>
<p>What makes these two adjacent seas so different?</p>
<p>Not the Jordan River—it pours the same good water into them both, nor the soil they lie on; nor the place around them.</p>
<p>The difference is this, the Sea of Galilee accepts the Jordan River but does not keep it. One drop flows in, and another flows out.</p>
<p>The other sea is more cunning, jealously hoarding what it takes in.</p>
<p>It cannot be induced to an impulse of generosity. Every drop it gets, it keeps.</p>
<p>The Sea of Galilee gives, so it lives. The other one gives nothing. It is called the Dead Sea.</p>
<p>There are two seas in Palestine.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people in the world.</p>
<h3>Zhao Songxue and His Wife</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>Zhao Mengfu, whose style name was Ziyang and sobriquet was Songxue Daoren, was a native of Huzhou. He was originally a member of the Song imperial family, surrendered to the Yuan, and served as a Hanlin Academician. Therefore, he was also called Zhao Chengzhi. His calligraphy followed Chu and Mi, especially his running script and regular script. The "Zhao Post" that people copy today is Mengfu's masterpiece. Although this man was a cultural traitor, he was romantic and unrestrained throughout his life, and he was good at poetry and lyrics, and can be called a great master of the Yuan Dynasty. He married Guan Zhongji, known as Madam Guan, who painted ink bamboo, orchids, and plums with a clear and elegant brush. Her calligraphy in running script and regular script was almost indistinguishable from Songxue's. After Madam Wei, there were no such people in the world. According to the Yuan History, there are many interesting things about the relationship between Songxue and his wife. At first, the two were extremely affectionate, but later, when Zhongji's beauty faded, Songxue had the intention of taking a concubine, so he tried to test her with a ci poem, saying: "I am an academician, and you are a wife. Have you not heard that Academician Wang has Taoye and Taogen, and Academician Su has Chaoyun and Muyun? It is not too much for me to marry a few more Yue girls and Wu girls. You are over forty years old, and you only occupy Yutangchun!" Zhongji, upon receiving the poem, also replied with a humorous poem, saying: "You me, me you, we are so affectionate, the affection is as hot as fire. We take a piece of mud and look at you, we knead you and me into being. If we break the two of us at the same time, and we mix the water until harmony, we reshape you, we knead you and me, you in my mud, me in your mud, we live together in the same quilt, die in the same ." Songxue was moved by her deep affection and gave up the idea of taking a concubine. In the past, Wenjun eloped with Xiangru. In his later years, Xiangru also wanted to marry again. Wenjun wrote "White Head Yin" to indicate her intentions. It can be seen that "infatuated women, unfaithful men" are the same throughout the ages. Although I am not a woman, I have always complained for the women's circle.</p>
