<h3>馬使繼任美國務卿　昨晨離京飛抵關島　主席夫婦親至機場歡送</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕美杜魯門總統駐華特使馬歇爾元帥，八日晨八時一刻，携蔣主席致美總統親筆函，乘五星座機離京返美，同行者有其私人參該長柯義上校等人。蔣主席夫婦，宋院長子文，王部長世杰，陳總長誠，俞部長大維，皮參軍宗敢，黃總幹事仁霖，中共王炳南，章文晋，美大使司徒雷登，美參事白德華，新聞專員康納士，及中外記者等約三十餘人到大校塲飛機塲歡送。今日大敎塲飛機塲上，籠罩黯然銷魂情調。王世杰部長於晨七時卅分，即到機塲，宋子文院長，陳總長，司徒大使，俞大維，亦先後趕抵。渠等在塲上俯首徘徊，默默不語，七時五十分，馬帥即乘五星汽車到達，渠今晨着淡黃色行軍大衣，佩五星肩章，戴軍帽。在此臨別之際，臉上亦籠罩依依惜別之情。渠甫下車，即爲機塲上之歡送人員包圍，一一握別，並與宋院長，王部長，陳總長，司使，在機塲一角長談。談後，又與機旁之行館職員可叮嚀握別，爲馬帥駕駛五星汽車之華籍司機老常，馬帥亦與之道別。俄而蔣主席夫婦抵機塲，馬帥即趨前脫帽握手，蔣主席祝馬帥一路平安，由皮宗敢參軍緒譯，談約五分鐘，馬帥即登機梯，蔣主席亦同上機，再與渠老友握別，並面致書信一件，託轉杜魯門總統，蔣主席在機內約三分鐘，即下機梯，馬帥依傍機門相送。八時十五分，機槳轉動，此在華十三個月之和平特使，即昇空向柬北方飛去。</p>
<p>﹝本報南京八日電﹞馬帥離京後不及半小時，此間即獲悉華府已發表由渠繼貝爾納斯出任國務卿之消息，各方對此一熟悉中國情勢之友人就任斯職，成極欣慰。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日合衆電〕國務卿貝爾納斯已辭職，並自一月十日起，開始生效，杜魯門總統宣佈任命馬歇爾將軍繼任國務卿。〔上岡右爲馬歇爾左爲貝爾納斯﹞</p>
<p>﹝聯合社關島八日電〕馬歇爾特使今日乘專機前往華盛頓，道出此間，小駐片刻，精神健旺，惟對就任國務卿後，將採取何種行動方針，則守緘默。或問將否遵循前任國務卿見爾納斯之一般政策，馬帥笑稱：「此際如果答覆此種問題，實屬蠢愚．馬帥係在飛機無綫電中，聆得新任命消息。惟稱：「余曾與總統討論此事，已知行將發表」。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯突辭職　華府外交界震動</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕貝爾納斯國務卿辭職事，自此間外交界政界及國會人士視之，恰如炸彈之爆發。參衆二院議員對貝爾納斯之離職，均引爲遺憾，但對總統任命馬歇爾繼其後任，則亦表未滿意。衆料國會必能批准此項任命。共和黨議員范登堡率先對才智卓絕之貝爾納斯辭職，引爲遺憾，認爲是一大損失。同時對素爲國會信任之馬歇爾，則表歡迎，預祝其成功。前任參議院外交委員會主席康納利亦對貝爾納斯揄揚備至。若千觀察家並謂：馬歇爾殊有出任總統之希望，蓋根據憲法，倘社魯門總統因或種原因而出缺，則由副總統繼任，目前並無副總統，（杜魯門即係由副總統升任總統）則唯有以國務卿補缺。</p>
<h3>馬使就新職後　中國政策不變　彭部工於記者會上發表談話</h3>
<p>﹝本報南京八日電﹞馬帥聲明發表後，各方極重視。彭部長八日午後於記者會席上稱：馬帥作此談話，自屬出於誠摯友好之精神，余亦以同等精神誦讀之。並謂，其中許多意思，馬帥曾對余談及。記者詢以馬帥何時與其談及？彭答：「曾數度談及」。惟未說明日期。彭氏對馬帥任國務卿事表欣慰，否認馬氏回國將爲對共產黨衝突之嚴重化。據稱，我人欽佩馬帥過去一年間對中國之努力，並承認杜魯門總統所申述馬帥之各種成就，今馬師被升任美國國務卿，可見美國方面與吾人觀感相同。至馬帥返國是否將爲中共樹突之嚴重化一問題，余不明二者如何互相關聯。中國政府之政策，自不因馬帥之升任國務卿而有所改變。關於改組政府及與各黨派商談進展悄形，彭謂，政府正努力實施改組，進行情形良好，但尚無具體消息可塞告。</p>
<h3>司使聲明　否認退休</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕司徒大使八日聲明，渠現無退休意，外傳馬帥返國後，渠將提辭呈說不確。共黨採取緘默態度</p>
<h3>王世杰表示欣慰</h3>
<p>共黨採取緘默態度</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕王世杰於聞悉馬帥出任美國務卿新職後，表示欣慰。</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕共產黨發言人梅益，對馬帥出任美國務卿及馬發表談話二事，採緘默態度，不表示任何意見。馬使將有更多貢獻</p>
<h3>美國對華政策</h3>
<p>馬使將有更多貢獻</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日合衆電﹞馬歇爾今後將更能指導美國對華政策。消息靈通人士相信，被爲欲達成此目的，曾作不斷努力，而目前將以遙遠控制，而從事此項工作，可能較其在華時更能作一較爲廣泛之計劃矣。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯笑談　卸任為一快事</h3>
<p>今後將返故鄉休養</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕貝爾納斯昨晩在白宮宴會席上，有人詢以辭官之感想，貝氏作詼諧語曰：「一個政治家生平有兩天快活的日子，第一是當選的一天，第二是退休的一天」。貝氏繼稱：今後擬在南加羅里那州史巴丹堡故鄉，長期休養。</p>
<h3>雷震返京</h3>
<p>張治中來京係述職</p>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕彭部長八日午後於記奢招待會席上稱：張治中來京，純爲述職，新省局勢近無變化。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕雷震氏於四日晚來滬後，每日與各黨派人士接觸，轉達政府，希望各然派人士參加，早日完成憲政進備之誠意，與恢復和談之決心，同時探詢各黨派之意見，茲悉，雷氏以任務完畢，昨（八日）晚十時乘軍返京，即以此行結果向政府報告，如無特別需要，雷氏不再來滬，嗣後與各黨派接洽之工作，仍由張羣氏擔負。</p>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞羅隆基六日曾晤雷震，對時局交換意見。羅氏力陳改組政府之不可行，認為此舉將關閉談判之門，並戲舉宴客爲例，佳肴已盡，而欲以殘羹饗客，使負列席之名，來客雖愚，不致參加。</p>
<h3>滬上工商情形　政府極為注視　彭部長謂正不斷改善</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕彭部長八日午後宣稱：上海爲全國經濟生活之神經中樞，政府對該地工商情形特予注意，彭氏此一談話，係答覆某記者所詢「政府對銀行工商危機採何對策」一問題而發者，據稱：政府確信工商方面不致有何重要動亂，羅斯爾總統有言，最可畏渚，莫過于恐懼，吾國在戰時與戰後遭受巨大破壞，發生艱鉅之經濟復興問題，除長期努力與刻苦節約而外，殊鮮捷徑。在大問題解決之前，政府須維持現有之農工商交通事業，而不斷加以改善，每日須與造謠者，投機者，囤積居奇者作戰，每日有新問題發生，必須妥爲解決，且必須權衡利害，作斷然有力之處置，過去已採取許多辦法，將來仍須努力不懈。</p>
<h3>滬市參議會全體同人　均感念馬使賢勞　潘議長徐副議長發表共同談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕馬歇爾元帥於前晨奉召離華返美，榮任美國務卿之職，本市各界對馬帥此去，均表示惋惜。記者特向若千地方領袖探詢感想，據潘議長公展，徐副議長寄廎，共同告記者稱：「馬歇爾元帥自前年歲暮奉杜魯門總統之特命，由美來華，除去年三月間曾回美述職一次外，其爲中國和平統一所作之努力，前後貽達一年，辛勞奔走，苦心斡旋，爲吾人所共見共聞。雖馬帥促成和談之努力，迄爲極端份子所阻撓破壤，而尚未見完全之成功，但政協會議早經通過，「和平建國綱領」，軍隊之整編統編方案，又經政府與共黨同意簽訂，而召開國大，制定民主憲法，更由政府遵循政協之協議原則，於去年年底完成，今年元旦公布。凡此，中國向民主憲政和平統一之大道邁進，吾人同樂見政府所取政策之正確，但亦深悉此皆馬帥在華一年來忍耐努力之效果。馬帥此次奉召返美，將膺新命，任務重要，臨行匆促，未能過滬，吾人未克與其握別，非常悵惘。市參議會全體同人，必均感念馬帥留華期間之賢勞，而尤深信其此去主持盟邦外交責任，必更有助於中美邦交之敦陸與世界和平之維持。吾人敬以此意祝馬帥旅途之健康，與任務之成功」。</p>
<p>又據接近外交界人士，認爲馬帥此去不論對目前國內及以後美國對華均可謂一很好現象。値此反動份子正激烈排美之際，馬帥返國亦或可减少反美運動之嚴重性。</p>
<p>中宣部駐滬代表馮有質發表感想如下；馬帥在過去一年餘來，爲中國和平統一而努力，其情神及貢獻實使吾人感激。美國希望中國和平，則於彼亦有利或係事實，但美國朝野確不願見其友邦，陷於痛苦不安狀態。馬帥返國後，國共和談雖不致中斷，但因乏人居間調解，恐將更多困難。馬帥奔走各方目的在協助促成中國和平統一，達到眞正民主國家，吾人惟有希望趕快完成渠對中國之願望，以感謝馬帥誠意及其一年餘來之賢勞。</p>
<h3>美國對大連問題照會　外部正研究究覆文　中印兩國準備互派使節</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電﹞中宣部八日記者招待會中，記者問，報載中國政府請求收回西沙羣島，同時報載中國國旗已飛揚於西沙羣島，請問眞相如何？</p>
<p>外部歐洲司長葉公超答稱：中國政府已由日本佔領中收回西沙羣島，該羣島主權本屬中國，故無經過向任何方面「請求一收回之手續。</p>
<p>問，中國政府對美政府所根關於大通之照會，態度如何？又中國政府接收大連，將有何種手續　葉答，中國政府已收到美國政府關於大連之照會，其內容與報間所載大致相同，關於大連之法律地位，本人前次已發表意見，今日無所補充者。　問，中印兩政府已同意升格互設大使館，請問中印政府是否將商討互設領事館事宜。</p>
<p>葉答，中印兩政府，於去年十月廿二日同意將彼此之專員公署升格爲大使館，現兩國政府均準備派遣使節，我國在印度向設有領事館，印度政府則最近在上海初步設立領事館。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京八日電﹞葉公超宣稱：對美國所提大連問題之照會，外部現正在研究覆文，目前大連局勢並無任何變化。倫敦外部發言人稱</p>
<h3>英盼開放大連</h3>
<p>倫敦外部發言人稱</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕英外部發言人今日宣稱：關於大連問題，英國雖未追隨美國向蘇聯提出照會，要求履行中蘇條約，但甚望該港能完全開放，成爲眞正世界通商之自由港。美國務院向蘇聯政府提出照會時，英國亦未與之有何接洽。</p>
<h3>民盟決定設立　政治計劃委會</h3>

<h3>馬使離華聲明全文</h3>
<p>﹝美國新聞處華盛頓七日電﹞杜魯門總統駐華特使馬歇爾將軍，本日向美國人民作坦白之報告，據稱：「中國和平之最大障礙，厥爲國共兩方之猜疑」。奉總統之召而立即返美報告中國局勢之馬歇爾將軍續稱：「誠意獲致調解之努力，再三遭受雙方極端份子之阻撓」。渠稱：依渠之見，「挽救大局」之道，在於蔣主席手下工作之各黨派自由份子集團，領導採取實際之步驟，藉以履行中國最近通過之民主憲法。</p>
<p>據國務院發表：馬帥告示深切關心遠東局勢發展之美國人民之文告，內容如次：</p>
<p>「總統最近曾發表過去一年內中國一切發展之綜合報告，以及美國政府對華之立塲。目下之環境使余對於此事應以最先獲得之印象、有所補充。</p>
<p>在本人進行談判以便促成中國和平與民主政府之時期內，若干問題，乃余所認爲比較重要者，際此複雜而混亂之局勢中，余僅將述及各該比較重要之問題。</p>
<p>第一，和平最大之障礙，厥為國共兩方彼此究全以猜疑相對。</p>
<p>一方面，政府領袖堅決反對組織一共產主義式之政府。另一方面，共產黨人則坦率聲明，謂彼等係馬克斯主義者，雖則首先將經由英美型之民主方式政府，但仍企求在中國建立一共產主義式之政府。</p>
<p>政府領袖認爲：中共願意參加去年一月間政治協商會所規定之政府，此種表示，純出於破壞性之意旨。余相信：中共人士深感政府方面並無履行政協決議組設新政府之誠意，中共人士並認爲政府且以軍事力量之威脅及秘密警察之行動存心消滅共產黨。除此項濃重之相互不信任外，國共雙方且有一顯而易見之錯誤，此即忽視在談判中此項疑懼對於對方考慮若干建議或反對理由時之影響。雙方均斤於設法消弭自身之疑懼。因此，雙方對於對方之立塲均存偏見，且對每一建議或可能性，均具戒心。遙遠及廣大軍事衝突前綫所傳來之混亂新聞，復使此項錯誤愈見深重。斥堠衝突每被故意歪曲爲大規模攻勢行動。雙方均利用曲解以中傷對方。余亦只得仰賴執行總部所屬小組中之美籍官員之報道，略窺事實眞相，而且事件次數極多，所佔之地區亦極廣大，以致美方人士遂有顧此失彼之感。余對美軍及海軍陸戰隊排除極大障礙，爭取中國和平之卓絕英勇，謹此加以述及。</p>
<p>余以爲最近談判決裂最重要之因素如下：在國民政府（實際上亦即國民黨）方面最有勢力之集團，對於余促成眞正聯合政府之一切努力，幾無不加以反對。此種反對，往往以政治或黨的行動爲掩護，但國民黨即是政府，故其行動雖非直接，而其勢殊不可侮。被等公然坦白宣稱：中共之合作實爲不可想像之事，惟有武力政策方能解決問題，此一集團包括軍事與政治各領袖。</p>
<p>在中共方面，余相信內有激烈份子，亦有自由份子，但有不少人竭力反對此種見解以爲中共黨紀嚴厲，在一黨內決不容有如此不同之觀點。但在余看來，共產黨方面，確有自由份子集團在內，尤其一般靑年，彼等因痛恨當地政府之腐敗而傾向共產黨，但彼等重視中國人民之利益，更甚於立即建立共產政府之魯莽措施。至於眞正極端之共產黨徒，則不惜任何激烈之手段，以求達到其目的，例如破壞交通，以便破壞中國之經濟，而造成有利於推翻政府之局面，至於人民所受之直接痛苦，則在所不計。彼等完全不信任國民黨之領袖，彼等似乎相信：凡政府所提出之建議，無一非用以打倒共產黨者。去年二三月間，顯然受人鼓動之羣衆暴動（其中若干次發生之地點離余從事談判之地僅數椽之隔），予共產黨以良好之籍口，使其猜疑成爲合理。（下文接二版）</p>
<h3>行政院舉行例會　任命東北經委會各處長</h3>

<h3>花園口堵工加緊　月終可如期完成　中共佈告將在下游築壩攔水</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封七日電〕花園口堵口工程，現正加緊拋石，証水面已不及三公尺，如引河水流順利，本月終可如限完成。現黃河故道水流的四十立方公秒，為全水卅分之一，深七公寸，闊卅米達，時速一華里，水勢涿漸湍急，八日可達蘭封附近，惟中共以遷移河床居民等問題為藉口，對堵口迭表反對，近更屢提抗談，中共駐汴代表趙明甫，除向堵復工程局抗議外，，並赴京與中共駐京代表董必武等有所商討，豫各界聞悉中共阻撓堵復工程後，極表憤慨，僉以黃河汎濫，豫境人民慘遭浩刦，倘少具人心，對此堵復工程，不應橫肆阻撓，以拯救汛區數百萬難胞。</p>

<h3>董必武抵滬　黃河問題會議　日內在滬召開</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕數千年來為患我國之黃河問題，最近又因渚口及復堤工作之措施，而因起政府與中共雙方之爭執。中共代表董必武氏應聯總中國分署署長艾格頓將軍之邀，巳於昨日乘早車抵滬，與有關方面洽商。同時黃河總工程師泰德（Tadd），亦將於日內自開封兼程來滬，參加黃河問題會議？行總霍署長寶樹，己於昨晚晋京請示，一俟霍氏返滬，會議即可召開，參加者包括征署長，艾格頓將軍，輩必武·泰德工程師，及水利委會代表等。據中共方面伍雲甫氏對記者表示：董氏此來最大之要求有三點：（一）暫緩堵；，以免引起山東方面之大水災；（二）從遠完成復堤工作，保證老河這不發生水患；（三）立即撥款一百五十億，敎濟須還移之人民，按我政府方面為拯救激皖蘇三省大百餘萬災　，及恢復廣大富庶之耕地，巳依照原定計觀之第一步，從事堵口與復堤之工作，而中共方面勛堅持花園口堵口工作，必須再延五個月，方可實行。伍氏稱：十二月廿七日放水後，預計本月十五日大水將到濟南，一月底二月初山東區將有大水，亟宜謀取解決之道，政府方而巳批准以六百六十億為復堤經費（巳撥下六十億），一百五十億為救濟費（已允先撥交三分之二），黃河兩岸共長一平九百蘿里，其修築工作至為　童，問題亦多，將俟各代表在滬開會後，</p>

<h3>國防部發言人談　大連附近無戰事　國軍在大長山島登陸說無稽</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕國防部軍事發言人，本日答覆本社記者詢問時稱：關於大連附近軍事動態，外間頗多揣測之詞，而新聞界又多以訛傳訛，上海文匯報轉載合衆社北平五日電，調國軍在東北發動第一次登陸戰，攻克大連東北六十哩之大長山島及海洋島等語，査大連北面國軍在普蘭店以北，幷未前進，東面國軍在莊河以西地區，亦朱與共軍發生接觸，至於治海一帶，僅有少數海防艦艇巡邏，維持治安，幷無在大長山島及海洋島登陸之事，望谷界勿為流言所惑。</p>

<h3>馬使離華聲明全文　上接第一版</h3>
<p>中共程序中之極有書及煽動性之階段，則為宣傳文字。余願吿示美國人民：此糧宣傳已全然不　眞理及事實經過，對吾人政府之政策及意志，極邊故意曲解及祇毀之能事，日種種事實均足證明此項宣傳之主要目標欺騙中國及世界人民，數發彼等對美國痛根心理。對於此項公然詆毀及全然不顧事實之行動，吾人實難保持緘默，然而一次否認後，則非侮日均有否認不可，此又為美國會員絕難客忍之一種工作，秉公言之，國民政府新聞公佈機構雖無中共宜傳之罪縣性質，亦有睹多錯誤之報導。中共對於安平事件所發表之聲明，尤其純屬杜撰，安平事件之結果，為海軍陸戰隊士兵死者三名，負傷十二名，此項事件係出自有計劃之埋伏截擊，被襲者為輸送執行總部供應品及若干職總物資之海軍陸戰隊運輸數，中共方面之報導、則謂此項事件係由防禦海軍陸戰隊襲擊而起。對於此項事件之調査工作，亦屬故事遷延，以便掩飾此項事件之眞實及私自承認的事實。</p>
<p>雙方之極端份子，曾使獲致解決之誠密工作一再挫折。一年前政治協商會所獲致之協議係自由而且遠大之憲章，此項憲章遂為中國奠定一和平及復興基礎。惟國民黨中之不妥協人士，意欲保持其自身對中國之封建控制，顯無秉承政協決議之誠意。余雖以軍人之姿態現身說法，然而余對軍事之支配力魚亦復開以為憾。軍事之支記力魚已使中國政府之力量愈益薄弱。同　，祥寨中觀形勞之人士必須牢記者：並非少數共黨集團或委員會之工作（此種工作，亦為我人在美國所司空見慣者），而係萬萬人民及一百餘萬軍人之動態。</p>
<p>余從未能確定中共內部態度之演進。最近數月中，中共所追隨之路綫，顯示被等不願促成公允之妥協，此為最確定者。即欲促使中共代表與政府代表會談問題，亦屬不可能。中共現巳提出最後要求，而促使談判中斷。彼專要求解散國民大會並恢復一月十三日之軍事地位，此皆政府所不能接受者。</p>
<p>在政府中佔有優勢之反動派與不妥協約共黨之間（余必須聲明在二月問共產並無此種不妥協之表示），現已有一種間題：此即如何使和平安樂陽予飽受痛苦而目前被分階之中國人民是也。政府中之反動派，顯然以為不論其行動如何，必能獲得美國之帮助。共產黨則不願為國家利益而妥協，彼等以為經濟崩潰將使政府倒台，並深倡沿鐵路交通的廣泛游擊戰，將加速政府之倒台，而將中國人民所受之痛苦，置諸不顧。</p>
<p>據余觀察所及，此項情勢之挽救，惟有　政府中之自由份子與少數黨派担任領袖，少數黨派為優秀人物之集合，惟仍缺乏政洽權力以實施控制之影響。余相信：在　主席領導之　，此等團體如能總利推行工作，必可經由良奸之政府而達到團結之目標。</p>
<p>事實上，國民大會業已制訂一項民主之憲法，其中主要部份均與去年一月各黨各派政治協商會議決定之原　相符合·不幸共產黨未能認為可以參加此次之大會，而該會通過之憲法則似巳包括彼等主要之要求在內。</p>
<p>中國政府不久即將進行重要之改組，而一九四七年聖　簡前將可完成選舉然後實施憲法，目前民主中國之形式旣已由新訂之憲法奠定，其實際步驟，目將成為一種試鍊矣。至於眞誠歡迎各黨各派積極負担政府責任，從事充實民主中國形式一點，政府確能做到佣種程度，則猶在未定之天</p>
<p>第一步將為改組國府委員會與政府之行政部門，以待憲法之實施。實行改組之方法以及對自由份子與非國民黨黨員之代表席數，將有重大之關係。吾人並希望在此過渡時期內，共產黨或其他集團仍有機會得以參加政府，共同負担起中國前途之責</p>
<p>國民黨治下，訓政時期已吿結束，此點早已正式聲明在案。一黨之統洽若果眞正終止，測國民黨即應終止收受政府之財政</p>
<p>余所言皆坦白無諱，蓋非如此不能希望美國人民明瞭此複雜之問題。余在談判進行時期內，巳發表此種見解，余以為大多數有關係之個人均巳知之。余今公開發表，乃因此為余之職責所在，向對於遠東局勢一切發展深切關心之美國人，提出余對於此種局勢及一切可能性之估計。」（完）</p>
<h3>政府決設民航局　擬聘陳納德主持　陳氏昨晩赴京晉謁主席</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕我國航空事業之組絀，早有改進之必要，自飛行慘開作繼發生後，政府當局即決心設立底航局，並據以飛虎將軍陳納德主其事，陳納德將軍已於六日晚應邀階秘書舒伯炎上校乘夜車晋京，晋謁蔣主席，並與各有關方面會談，定本週末返滬，陳氏臨行對記者稱：渠甚願協助中國，組織一較為良好與現代化之航空機構，按去年五月陳氏三度來華時，蔣主席即邀渠出任交通部總顧問，陳氏堅辭，最近政府又有意以陳氏主持即將成立之民航局，陳氏是否接受，尙待其回滬後方可決完。陳氏此次赴京，除謁　主席外，並將與空軍總司令馬至柔氏商討行總空運大隊之飛機降落問題。</p>

<h3>送馬歇爾將軍回國</h3>
<p>美國杜魯門總統特使馬歇爾將軍，業於昨晨乘坐五星元帥私人飛機離華返國。馬特使此去原為親向杜魯門總統述職；可是在馬將軍離我首都一小時半後，從美國傳來的消息，卻報道杜魯門總統已提名馬歇爾將軍為國務卿，以繼貝爾納斯之任。同時，馬將軍原擬到達美京後發表有關中國局勢的文吿，亦提早於將軍離京後發表。凡此事態的急遽發展，在此一短時間內而有這樣高度的展開，實出一般人意料之外。這眞彷彿像投下了一顆原子炸彈；我們直接受到這顆原子炸彈影響的人，眞不知從何訴說起我們的心情。</p>
<p>首先，我們自不能不由衷訴說我們對於馬歇爾將軍的感謝。這一年來將軍以杜魯門總統特使的資格。對於中國的統一和平，斡旋奔走，勞瘁不辭。這種精神感動侮一個善良的中國人。將軍在中國的努力並沒有失敗，由於他的努力，我們看見有「政協」的召開，及其所成立的决議，特別是軍隊統編整編的決議。這是得到政府輿共產黨一致的支持的。如今就編整編雖尙未完全實現；就是此一協議的成立，己足表示將軍在華的成功。况在這次國民大會所通過的中華民國憲法，又多少實受了馬歇爾將軍的感召。這憲法是各方不堅持成見的結晶，是容忍精神的良好表現。値得中國人民永為感奮的，就是這部憲法的制成，正當馬歇爾將軍留華期內，這種容忍精神的表現，無疑地，多少由於馬歇爾將軍的感召。即此上點，馬歇爾將軍對中國人民的功績，已足昭垂萬禩。當將軍於去歲十二月二十日飛抵上海赴京就任之際，本報著論歡迎，曾有句曰：「目前敵寇降伏，正當我們積極建國的時候，偉大的盟邦，特派像馬歇爾元帥的使節到中國來，眞使我們想起當美國建國之初，建國理想與美國相同的法蘭西亦派了一位傑出的軍事政治人物到美國去的往事。我們願馬歇爾儿帥來華，在中國人民中所起的影響，亦能够像辣斐德在美國人民心理中起的影響一樣」。現在中國的憲法旣烙印着馬歇爾將軍的精神，足與民國千秋是，不僅我們的願望為不虛，抑亦足以示馬歇爾將軍在華的成功。茲當將軍離華返國，實不勝依依惜別之情。</p>
<p>其次，我們所要說的，是祝賀馬歇爾將軍的新任命。馬歇爾將軍此去將出任美國的國務卿。杜魯門總統此際將這個責任交給馬歇爾元帥是最明智的決定。自從故總統羅斯福逝世以來，美國的政治頓然失去了一個重心。杜魯門總統以非常之才，當非常之時，膺非常之任，處境艱難，衆所周知。因其有非常之才，故能運用其非常之智，所以自他膺非常之任以來，頗能於各種矛盾之中，善以自處。國務卿負折衝樽俎之責，况値戰後，美國的外交尤為各國所企仰，貝爾納斯亦以非常之才。膺國務卿非常之任；膺命以來，對於執行美國國策，迭著功績，於是乃引起少壯派政客之不滿，我們遂看見有像這樣的人物如前商務部部長華萊士的抨擊。這一抨擊，不但對於身處國務卿地位的貝爾納斯大有影響；就是對於美國本身的威望，也大有影響。差幸杜魯門總統有明智的決斷，將商務部部長予以罷免。這雖然多少挽救了美國的聲望；然而華萊士這一抨擊的創傷，依舊未能全復。去歲美國大選，共和黨又在國會中抬起了頭。在這個時候，杜魯門總統不能不讓勞苦功高的貝爾納斯掛冠以去。而此際能膺國務卿之任的，舍馬歇爾將軍以外，實沒有第二個人。何以言之？現在美國的行政首長是屬於民主黨籍的杜魯門總統；而民主黨卻己不能控制美國最高立法機關的國會－共和黨在上次選舉的結果，己能操縱國會。現在美國人民所關心的第一是外交，第二是內政。屬於民主黨籍的貝爾納斯自不能不於此時求去；而繼其任者，必一定是一個超政黨的人物，而同時又必須能得到舉國一致擁戴的。這除了馬歇爾將軍，能有誰呢？對於馬歇爾將軍的新膺重命，我們表示無限的欣慰。因為此際只有像將軍這樣才智的人，纔能膺此新命。中國人民這一年來深知將軍才智的卓越，加以這一年來在中國的經驗，深知將軍此番之另膺親命，不但能夠勝任愉快，且更能使中美關係趨於緊密。我們深信這位五星元帥，旣能以他非常之才，擊潰軸心；必更能使戰後的世界能夠獲致持久和和平。我們於此謹祝將軍新使命的成功。</p>
<p>復次，我們所不能不一言的是馬歇爾將軍臨去時所發表的文吿。在這一文吿裏，我們可以看見將軍對於中國局勢的怎樣關心，和他具有軍人氣概的坦白率直。對於這一文吿，我們雅不欲多所論列。如今馬歇爾將軍是離華歸國，另膺新命了。這一新命·無疑地，足以影響整個時節的安危。將軍新自中國回去，對此新命，必能從一個更闊的角度來決定所鷹採取的行動。中國局勢之發展到現階段，原有其歷史的背景。馬歇爾將軍現在一個更闊的角度上，深信對於中國局勢的改善，必大有裨益。如何來推進將軍出任國務卿以後的中美關係，此在將軍，固或己胸有成竹，惟站在中國人民的立塲，我們願另文再申我們的所見。</p>

<h3>美國今後外交動向　世界各國密切注視　英工黨對貝文政策將作新檢討</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕美國務翹貝爾納斯辭職及由馬歇爾繼任一項消息傳至此間時，英政府人士均表駭異。聞貝文外相與艾德禮今最將進一行會談，討論馬歇爾出任國務卿後，對美國外交政策有何影響一項問題，尤其是關於巴勒斯坦局勢，馬歇爾將作何方針。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕此間人士談稱：馬歇爾繼貝爾納斯之後，出任國務卿一事，殆可視為美國外交政策將趨向右傾，英國現正在焦切等候莫斯科之不良反應，蓋最近數月以來，莫斯科常嚴詞抨擊美國之對議政策，斥諸為在整個太平洋區之「帝國主義目的」歲也。反之，蘇聯政府素極重視軍事領袖，或將因此能對馬歇爾表示良好反應云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕英國工黨今日宣布：本黨於二月份起，將在全國各地舉行一連串非正式會議，曉示黨員以政府之外交政策，外相具文及其他閣員均將號表演說。按自去年底工黨發現一部份叛黨議員後，該黨領袖即展開「敎育」運動，下月之演講會即為最新步驟。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎八日電〕此間外交界人士預料美國新任國務卿馬歇爾將繼續改善美蘇關係。貝爾納斯辭職一訊，此間人士聞之驚異，僉謂自共和黨選舉勝利後，員爾納斯辭職雖屬可能，但就草擬對德國前衛星國之和約及就國家利益問題與共和黨參議員相商一項原則而論，渠之成就已使其地位大見增强。今之出於辭職，殆為一種政黨政治之比賽行動，民主黨有將其保留之意云。</p>
<h3>蒙帥在蘇酬酢忙　明日將晤史達林</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科七日電〕英參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥今日參觀伏羅希洛夫軍校，蘇軍將官詳為解釋紅軍訓練之技術。午刻蘇外長莫洛托夫在托爾斯泰紀念堂歡宴蒙帥，席問蒙帥答覆蘇將領之歡迎辭，力言英蘇有維持良好關係之需要。今日適為俄人之聖誕節，夜間田蘇聯柯尼埃夫元帥等諸名將陪同觀舞踊劇。</p>
<p>又據合衆社電：蒙帥預定在蘇聯勾留四天，十日史達林將在克林姆宮宴請蒙帥。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科七日電〕負責方面今日宣稱：蒙帥來蘇聘問擬使蘇聯當局明瞭英美兩國任何軍事協定，並無拒絕他國參加性質。蒙帥將聲明英國歡迎蘇聯在聯合國機構下參加此類協定。按蘇聯評論家對於英美擬使兩國軍備與訓練計劃標準化一事，曾加指責。</p>
<h3>安理會討論　普遍裁軍案</h3>
<p>特港問題尙待決定</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖七日電〕安全理事會今日對特里埃斯特港歸聯合國管理一事，展期討論，澳洲代表曾質問此一計劃之法理性，比利時代表則要求從長研究。衆料該案之批准，不過為形式問題，但大國鑒於此種意外的反對，故不催促表決，但該案如欲生效，必須獲七票贊成。安理會定九日再度討論。同時安理會八日開會，將討論普遍裁軍之重大間題。</p>
<h3>柯孚事件</h3>
<p>尙未向安理會提出</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖七日電〕關於英國政府擬將阿爾巴尼亞在柯孚海峽放置水雷一事列入聯合國安全理事會議事日程內，英國代表團雖尙未接獲政府訓令，但聞有英國海軍部專家二人現在紐約等待，至將此事提交安全理事會討論時，作為英國代表買德幹爵上之頗問。</p>
<h3>南極會議　目前不致召開</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕貝爾納斯頃以最後一次國務卿姿態，出席情報會議，對於要求即行召開國際會議，研究至少有九國對南極大陸所提出之領土要求，一項建議，表示冷淡之態度，並作如下之解釋曰：南極情勢，並非急迫之事，目前正有許多其他政治會議，須待舉行，故不必即行召開此項國際會議云。</p>
<p>另悉：挪威與紐西蘭現皆極注意南極之會展情形，紐西蘭總理並在喚起英澳之興趣，擬派探險隊前往設立科學站，以便常期進行研究工作。</p>
<h3>希境調查團　中蘇代表亦已任命</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖七日電〕聯合國安全理事會擬組織一調査委員會，前往巴爾襲半島實地調査。頃據官方宣佈，蘇聯政府巳任侖比利時大使賴夫利契夫為代表，中國政府亦巳任命駐比利時大使金問泗為代表。</p>

<p>〔路透社西貢七日電〕法越之間雖未宣佈戰爭然態，但河內之法軍參謀部已完全依照宣戰狀襲而動員。今日消息謂，法機城化部隊兩隊自河內及海防向東西推進，已在兩城間之公路會師，但法方認為此次成就，恐難以久持。又據勒格萊將軍談稱，法軍已逐漸能控制河內及海防之局勢，正向兩城週圍逐漸伸展中。</p>
<h3>河內法軍狗肉充飢</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺七日電〕此間今日收聽越盟電台廣播，謂河內法軍糧食恐慌。越軍所獲法俘膚供稱，一部份法軍與客籍軍隊（即前納粹德人），不得不殺死警犬與越犬以充飢，河內蔬菜完全缺乏。德國客籍軍隊開到越盟共和國塊內，非法越條約所謂。該電台並稱，法當局巳徇華僑之請，每日自海防撤退華僑五十名。</p>

<h3>猶太恐怖團體　傳已停止活動</h3>
<p>〔路透社聯路撤冷七日電〕此間盛傳伊爾根黨及史德恩黨兩恐怖團體，已接受溢和份子之數吿，在英方之誠意得獲老騐以前，停止恐怖活動，惟英軍總部謀報部，則謂不　有此事。過去廿四小時來巴勒斯坦未發生襲擊英軍之事，將　之起，或則在此。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕據可靠消息，巴勒斯坦問題團眾會議，定本月廿一日在輪渡恢復舉行。</p>
<h3>杜魯門施政計劃　國會中將遇難關　共和黨反對普遍軍訓　堅決主張減低所得稅</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統之行政方針，與共和黨國會固巳同床各夢，總統明午提出其挽救經濟蕭條與恢復繁榮之預算案時，此種裂痕將更為擴大。目前總統之許劃，已引起下列爭執：（一）總統對於下屆財政年度，擬提出三百七十億元預算案，共和黨巳表示反對。據稱，總統之預算案咨文、將說明剩餘款項不及十五億元。此款須用以償付二千五百三十億元左右之國債。大部份共和黨員稱嚴格節約，可能减低所得稅百分之二十，仍能减少國債。（二）大部份國會議員對於總統主張設立二十人委員會調査防止罷工方法一事，鮮加注意。（三）總統主張陸海軍部合併，似有在新國會一加檢討之機會。但一般均反對普遍軍訓，並贊成聽由戰時徵兵法於今年三月卅一日廢止。</p>
<h3>關於蘭舉行普選事　美照會英蘇兩國　指責波蘭政府採取壓迫措施　波農民黨擬抵制選舉</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓七日電〕美國務院今日透露美政府於一月五日分別致牒蘇聯外次維辛斯基及英大使寇爾，指責波蘭政府從事壓迫措施，如以政治聲察逮捕政見不同之人，殺人及侵入住宅，並壓制新聞自由等，表示對此等現象深感不安，如果不立即停止，與波茨坦協完相符之民主選舉實不能舉行。據云美駐華沙大使於十二月十八日，曾接獲波蘭農民黨領袖副總理米柯拉齊克之備忘錄，揭路波政府壓制農民黨不使有政治自由之事。米氏謂壓制之方法包括逮捕，暗殺，强迫農民黨員加人共產黨社會黨等之集團，解傭農民黨員之職務，搜査其住宅等。此外對農民黨報紙亦予禁止出版或限制流通，並逮捕該黨報紙之編輯一人。照會繼細謂此等現象，對於波蘭選舉之影響尙在其次，但對於國際協定原則之維隨期關係重大，故美國政府為為波茨坦協定之簽字國如不能盡力執行該一協定，即為未能克盡厥職。因此認為英美蘇三國應以最友警但最堅決之態度促起波政府注意其未能遵行協定規定之義務。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華沙七日電〕波蘭即將舉行普選。頃據波蘭農民黨主席米柯拉齊克談稱：本黨已有大批選舉票被作廢，屆時屬於本黨之選民將有二百萬人，無法投票。本黨執行委員會將開會決定是否抵制此次普選，但此舉將視普選總幹事如何答復而定云。</p>

<h3>美參眾兩院聯席會議席上　杜魯門總統演詞全文（中）</h3>
<p>勞資關係</p>
<p>在剛剛過去的一年內－　第一次大戰後的那一年殺－勞資糾紛不斷發生。</p>
<p>一九四六年這種經濟戰雖巳　發，然而今日我們正生產數量相當可屬的貨物和服務。不過改善勞資雙方獲致協議的方法以及减少罷工和意工次數却是重要的事。</p>
<p>我們不鷹採納懲罰性的法案。我們不鷹為了懲處幾個勞工領袖而通過那些勢必限制勞工正常的法規。我們不應在感情的驅使下採取不加考慮的行動，危害我們美國人的自由，招致不期然而來的災禍。　我們於檢討一九四六年勞資糾紛的紀錄時，應曉得勞資未能獲致停止工潮的協議。資方亦難辭其咎。為此，我們應曉得光靠針對工會的法律，工業和平是無從獲得的。</p>
<p>在過去十五年內，我們已根據自由集體談判為決定薪給和工作條件的原則建立一國家勞工政策。</p>
<p>那個國家政策依然不變。道種勞工政策仍應賡績為國家政策。</p>
<p>然而我們之中還有不懂何謂自由及公允談判的人。我們也沒有全懂得如何克盡與談判的權利俱來的相互責任。目前我們不無若干限制集體談判制度效能約有害條例。而且我們並缺乏協助勞資消弭異見的政府機關。</p>
<p>若干勞歲問題應立即加以注意，若干其他則因其錯綜複雜性，必須予以詳盡的調查和研究。我們應通過法案以糾正若干錯誤並規定政府對勞資談判應予以更多的協助。我們並鷹設身處地深切暸解勞資困難的徵結。</p>
<p>我有鑒於上述種種，特建議諸位並籲請諸位實現下列包括四點的計劃，以减少工業上的鬥爭：</p>
<p>第一點</p>
<p>為早日通過法律，防止某些不正當的條例、　首先，本點下的是工會與工會爭奪控制權所引起的罷工。人民和資方在這種罷工中是無辜的旁觀者，然而却備受敵對工會間的衝突所帶來的損害。這種糾紛危害生產，工業，人民和勞工目身。我認為工會與工會爭奪控制所引起的罷工是難於防止的。</p>
<p>國家勞工關係法案規定有決定那一個工會代表某一資方所屬職工的程序。可是在若干工會與工會爭奪控制權所引起的體工中，小數派工會却宣佈罷工，强迫資方與其談判，而置那些與多數派工會談判的法律責任於不顧。壓迫資方違反法律的罷工是不可寬恕的。通過防止這種罷工的決案顧然是必要的事。</p>
<p>另一種工會與工會問的不協調是涉及某些問題的工會與工會間爭執所引起的罷工，亦即工會應負責完成一種特殊工作的問題。常敵對工會不能自行解決那種糾紛時，當局即應有某種規定，以期和平解決該問題。</p>
<p>其次的一種不正當條例是同情罷工，這種罷工每會加深工會與工會爭執所引起科紛，或强迫資方違反國家勞工關係法。</p>
<p>並不是一切同情罷工都是不正常的。我們應就它們的目標來判斷。換言之，意在保障工資數率和工作條件的同情罷工就和那些意在加深工會與工會爭執所引起的罷工不同。工業的機構有時也需要工會擴展某種衝突超出某一特殊資方的範圍。我們不應不分靑就皂白，一概禁止同精罷工。我們應有的目標為制定那些禁止立意不善的同情罷工，我們不應危害工會有以自存和爭取眞正集體談判利益的權利。‘</p>
<p>其次的一種亟應糾正的條例，是勞資雙方運用經濟力以決定解釋現存合同所引起的問題。</p>
<p>集體談判協議和其他合同般兩方也應加以進守。在最開明的勞資關係中，解釋合同內容所引起的糾紛是由談判或仲裁和平解決的。我們應制定法案，規定設立某種機構，俾便勞資雙方發生解釋現有合同的問題時得以請求仲裁。</p>
<p>第二點</p>
<p>是擴大勞工部裏面協助集體磋商的便利。</p>
<p>我們避免勞工爭執的困難之一，由於在集體磋商進行中缺乏秩序。勞資雙方往往不明自他們應以自動談判解決糾紛的責任·我們常常看到勞方或資方採用經濟勢力的例子，而不盡力從磋商的辦法當中取得同意。無論勞資兩力或政府都沒有確切的辦法來確定如何可以引起政府的協助。政府機構應採取調解或仲裁的步驟，而確定爭執的事實，並向公衆報吿。這種機構應當便利並加速爭執的解決。</p>
<p>第三點</p>
<p>是搬究我們社會立　的計劃，以便减輕工人不安定的原因。</p>
<p>一九四六年六月十一日在我否決開斯議案的咨文中，我槪括地聲明我對於勞資關係的意見。那個時候我說的話現在再來重述一遍：勞資困難的解決不但可在直接關於勞工關係的立法中找到，而且也可在一種計劃中找到，這種計劃的目的在於祛除我們工業社會中許多工人所感覺的不安定的原因。例如：國會鷹考慮延長並擴大我們的社會安全制度，改良居住問題，全國健康計劃，和一個公正的最低限度工資的規定。</p>
<p>第四點</p>
<p>是成立了一個臨時的聯合委員會，以研究全盤的勞資關係。</p>
<p>我建議國會成立這樣一個臨時的聯合委員會，以從事這一項廣泛的研究。</p>
<p>總統，國會以及勞資雙方都　有繼續合作以覓致勞資問題解決的責任。現在我建議這委員會的組織如下：由國會從兩院兩黨的議員中選出十二人，另由總統指定代表人民，及勞方的代表共八人。　該委員會應負責對主要問題進行調査與建議。生要問題包括：</p>
<p>第一　各重要工業中影響公共利益的全國性的罷工，此外，該委員會並應研究如何處置及防止罷工同時且不致損害民主自由的方法。</p>
<p>美國全部工業的前途，都有賴於這些罷工問題的適當解決。運輸，煤礦，石油，鋼鐵以及電信交通的全國性罷工的遠大影饗，是以造成全國的紛亂。我價近年曾經利用戰時的特殊法令而避免了這些紛亂，但這些戰時特殊權力不久就要取消了。這些權力一定要有另一個適當而有效的制度與機構來代替，這項問題要求我們仔細的研究和勇氣的應付。但這種應付的方法必需能和我們人民權利的維護互想符合。這項需要是迫切的，委員會必需對這件事儘早予以注意。</p>
<p>第二　便是實現集體談判的最佳方法與步驟。這一點應當包括勞資雙方都能自由而公平地談判，並且談判協調完全失敗以前，儘量避免罷工和僵局。</p>
<p>第三　是勞資科紛的內幕因素。這些因素中，有些需要長期的研究。但委員會可以立刻考慮另一些問題而立刻提出建議交予國會。</p>
<p>我建議委員會在一九四七年三月十五日以前，完成包括立法方面建議的報吿。</p>
<p>（明日續）</p>

<h3>張維備受責難　表示深感灰心　審查意見兩點提交大會公議　垃圾車案餘波　舉行緊急小組會討論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會衛生委員會以前日大會臨時動議關於衛生局垃圾車營私舞弊一案，急待審查，特於昨日下午五時在正始中學招待室舉行緊急小組會議，由范守淵任主席，張局長維出席再度報告此事查辦經過謂：本人得到車夫營私情事後，即派員化裝，於半夜間密查，前曾發現有垃圾車六輛營私，後又發現七輛，根據報告：「司機與菜販商定，每次私帶蔬菜與菜販，代價爲四百元至七百元。」當即呈請市長予以革職，並將爲首者開除。但司機生活淸苦，實堪同情，雖曾屢次提交淸這淸潔委員會，市政會議討論，及向市長私人報告，但均無妥善辦法。又曾與劉鴻生商討辦法，劉氏主張將垃圾車出售與司機保管，市府抽百分之六十作爲償還車價，但亦因種種困難，米成事實。張局長並聲明本人並非袒護屬下，但局中雖有少數不良份子，危害法規，然同時亦確有不少人員，奉公守法，埋頭苦幹。渠對各參議員責難重重，深感灰心。謂：「本人曾向市長四次辭職，但四次未准，但像本人這樣年紀，又不敢不告而去，本人極願接受諸公嚴辦，殺低限度予我以撤職。」言畢，局長遵參議員要求，迴避退席。</p>
<h3>議員表示意見　態度各有不同</h3>
<p>出席各參議員，對於此案紛紛表示意見、態度各有不同，有人認爲此事司機責任尚小，局長責任大，司機生活淸苦雖可同情，但風紀問題亦不可忽視，必須嚴辦，而市長亦明知犯法而不加阻止，亦應負責。趙參議員君豪表示張局長處置此案雖有失當，但司機因待遇過低不願任職，使局長處事極爲困難，於情理而言，亦有可原諒之處，故請建議大會將違法垃圾車夫開除後，再另籌應付辦法。路參議員式導列席該會提供意見二點謂；（一）公務人員待遇菲薄，營私事情，不能避免，同情肌可以，但市參議員負有監督市府之責，堂堂局長在大會中承認有此事件而任其作爲，如此下去，以後市參議會也可不必討論。個人站在客觀地位講，局長辦事困難應予原諒，但局長事先應考慮自己有多少力量，這是他的無能。（二）市參議會對於此事不提則已，旣已提出而衆皆注意，若不了了之，我們的正義何在？故這事非鄭重辦理不可。</p>
<p>但美參議員屏藩認為在情理上說，對局長應予從寬，勿使過於難堪。若說要嚴辦，則應查明局長是否有舞弊，不可任意爲之。</p>
<h3>意見兩點</h3>
<p>經討論許入後，結果根據陳參議員存仁提出審查報告草案，再由委員會全體修正後，擬定二點：（一）衛生局長承認屬員之不合法行爲爲合法行爲應貧責任，並鷹保證以後不再發生類似事件。（二）為整飭公務人員風紀起見，函請市府對本案賣職人員嚴予處分，並將辦理情形報告本會。衛生委員會對於上項審查報告，並無權決議，尚須提交大會審查。</p>
<h3>張維口頭答覆　一般衛生問題</h3>
<p>衛生局長張維。頭答覆前日之質詢稱：市立醫院自給自足，係因以往經費不够，至今雖言自給自足，市政府仍有補助。前有五百卅一病床分佈各院，如今改爲優待辦法，可多補助些病人。至言市立醫院分佈要平均，數量要多，如今不能說是合併，而是調整分佈，容量增加，職員不加，而經費可省。糞便問題，承辦亦需專門，至今收回自辦，幹部人員雖有，但管理方面終感困難，現在是否招商承辦，尚未肯定，正請人研究中。關於限制私立醫院收費，我很坦白說：還沒有一個醫坐發財，如有發財，亦爲副業而致；至言私立醫院處待病人事，要是有，定予嚴厲處置。國華殯儀館問題，在前俞局長時已經審查，並非敵產，故予發還。學校收取衛生費事，取之於學生，用之於學生，與經常衛生費無關。衛生局工作人員是否减少事，已遵照市參議會決議，將事務人員减少。瘋狗被咬打針復發問題，或因咬處關係，世界各地一樣，且有百分之三不救。至此因時間限制，其他未答覆者，均留待書面答覆。</p>
<h3>市參議會第三次會議　今日舉行小組審查會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第二次大會昨日下午舉行第三次會議，首由警察·社會·衛生•教育各局長答覆第二次會議質詢。繼由參議員對財政·地政·公用·工務各局提出質詢。又衛生委員會舉行臨時會議，討論垃圾車營私案，商決審查報告案二件，擬交大會公議。</p>
<p>今日議程，將爲第一次，小組審查會及第二次小組審查會，分別在福明邨市參議會及招商局等處舉行。又爲詳細討論預算起見，試會擬於十日及十二日上午增加舉行預算委員會二次，十一日上午舉行大會一次，專爲討論本年度預算。</p>
<p>麥克風前之三局長（上）顧毓琇（中）吳開先（下）俞叔平（本報記者攝）</p>
<h3>請增各級學費　籌設女子師範　敎育局長答覆質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敎育局長顧毓琇昨出席大會答覆質詢各點：（二）敎育經費至十一月份爲止，共用十八億元，另有一部份費用尚未計在內。十•十一•十二月份新加國民敎育班次，用費十三億元，其中包括敎職員生活補助費。市立學校已墊付達二十餘億元，市府准撥三十七億元，但尚未領得，本年底擬償還市校熱款十分之六，但至今財政局猶未籌撥。（二）廣播敎育電台已列入本年工作計劃，當可實行。（三）爲緊縮機構起見，已將藝術師範併人師範學校，但藝術師範確屬必要，仍請大會重行考慮，俾能成立。（四）私校上年度第二學期收費標準爲小學八萬至十二萬元，初中十二至十六萬，高中十六至二十萬元，如按上月生活指數，已較前定學費時增加百分之四十五，現爲兼籌並顧計，擬增加百分之二十五，請重訂小學十至十五萬，初中十五至二十萬，高中二十至二十五萬元。（五）市立中小學敎員呈請補助學術進修費，提請市府，請大會列入預算中撥給。上項三點昨已由市長列為交議案送請大會公決。（六）市體育塲曾屢次向軍事當局交涉收回，未獲結果，現已請市府呈請國防部賠債。（七）私校立案手續決從寬從速辦理。（八）郊區學校現已設一百十二所，國民敎育班已設一千五百餘所，佔全部二分之一以上，如有房屋，仍擬加辦。獻校經費可先作國民學校之用。（九）公敎子弟免費規定私立學校鷹設百分之二十五，但調查結果顧均僅百分之十五，現已再予通知。（十）女子師範擬將前幼稚師範改辦，現正與行總洽　商，俟僑胞收養所結束後即辦。（十一）敎育局如有附逆人員，請報告，決鄭重處置，又如市參議會認爲學校敎師太多，亦可裁减。</p>
<h3>社會局　答覆質詢</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞社會局長吳開先在昨日大會中答覆前日參議員有關該局質詢謂：（一）勞資評斷委員會係根據政院規定之單行法組織，採取合議方式，社會局乃負調解責任，其評斷範圍限於含有全市性質者。（二）公典已辦者有三處，擬再辦數處，滿期後舉辦標賣，辦法規定如標賣數超出原常數額，可持當票取回超過之款額。第一期即將舉行，如成績優良，將繼續辦理。平民區亦將在適當地點成立公典。（三）婦女收容所已決定俟冬令救濟庇寒所結束遣散後，正式成立。</p>
<h3>國產棉花無銷路　原因是纖維太短</h3>
<p>（四）國產棉花無銷路，並非紗廠不願採用，實因該項棉花纖維太短，現正在設法改良棉種。（五）靜安寺廟產牽涉司法問題，因該寺主持人有漢奸嫌疑，在法院未判決前，不能剝削其自治權。（六）商業登記係依經濟部規定，同一牌號商號於同時登記者須先審核，否則以先登記者得優先權。（七）關於冬令救濟，目的在於獲得捐款，其方法即不能顧及。前次選舉上海小姐，募款救濟蘇北難民，共得二十一億餘元，凈餘三億餘元，雖相差頗多，但亦可救濟不少難民。此次冬令救濟擬募四億元，慈善舞會亦可收一億數千萬元（八）爲使難童難民自謀坐計起見，現已與中國旅行社接洽設訓練班，至各地旅行社充任待應生，又與中國航空公司接洽設無綫電訓練班，如洽商成功，今年均可舉辦。此外又訓練難民難童爲修理器車匠。（九）後方失業工人早已與各廠方接洽，於十人中安插二人，現二千餘工人中已有一千餘有業。</p>
<h3>警局長答質詢</h3>
<p>警察局代理局長俞叔平，對日前參議員對警局之質詢，於昨日作口頭答覆稱：（一）關於消防設備費問題，前次大會議決定五億元。去年十二月呈請市府，至今尚未撥下。在前錢市長任內曾撥到五億元，已與震旦公司簽約，訂購機具。（二）關於警察待遇問題，經一再調整，現三等警察每月可得十四萬六千零四元，一等警察得十九萬零五百元，承市長關懷，每人另發食米五斗。福利事業則每局設有公共食堂，衣有制服，住有宿舍，敎育方面有子第學校，患病時有警察醫院，而撫恤費則特別優待。另因物價高漲，呈准市長，每者另撥五萬元。（三）本局祗整飭市容並米欲美化市容。錄取之義務警察，皆需初中畢業，身家淸白，方合乎標準。（四）北新涇盜匪問題，祗爲當地之流氓散兵流勇騷擾。前星期五晚上，本人親自督剿，捉獲七名，得槍兩枝，至今未聞再有盜警。（五）關於調騐烟民，生活困苦，睡水門汀一點，則調騐地址，在警察醫院內，設備完善，事實俱在，可請各位前往參觀。（六）騎巡隊裁撤問題，騎巡隊自有其存在效用，負有巡邏郊區，鎭壓暴動之任務，功效很大，此次亦出動北新涇剿匪，否則不能如此迅速，而二百五十匹馬皆係由陸軍總部撥給。（七）違警罰　由各分局於月初公佈，其中百分之六十解國庫，百分之四十則作賞金。（八）戶口調查工作，預算十西億元事，係五年計劃之　支，待大會公決。（九）警局博物館爲警察敎育工具，與敎育局之博物館不同。（十）警察醫院為警察福利而設，爲業務及刑事似查，覊犯病犯等之需要，有保留必要。（十一）關於攤販事件，本局因市府三令五申，參議會及輿論界之責問，乃負靑執行取締。經再三勸導，一再寬期，均無效果。十一月二十八日事件，已經市長潘議長及唐參議員等調查。（十二）關於沒收物品，係根據違警罰法，沒收貨物由市府侖令會同財政局。社會局審計處等拍賣，以所得作救濟之用。（十三）張志韓參議員所稱目睹警察任意拿小販物品事，希望以後發生時，能將警察號碼汽車號碼報告警局，一定依法辦理。因時間不及，其他質詢留待害面答覆。</p>
<h3>旅棧捐　認為與法無據　市府不可刨黃瓜兒</h3>
<p>休息十分鐘，繼之對財政，地政，工務，公用四局及民政處之質詢開始。</p>
<p>關於財政部門，邵永生稱：旅棧捐與法律無根據。上次大會未予通過，而其稅率係隨房價徵收百分之二十，即使算作特別稅，亦超過法定稅率。如言課稅對象為外來過境旅客，因彼等不負市政建設捐；則如本市居民離滬去杭期間，能否向財政局收回所繳數天市政建設捐，而杭州市政府亦是否再向上海旅客徵收旅棧捐？堂堂政府，不能作此「刨黃瓜兒」工作。因其與法不合，與情理欠通。董幹文稱：財政局對於稅收本身，有重新檢討之必要。瞿鉞稱：領營業牌照事，雖由財政局辦理，但因有向衛生警察等局調查之手續。公文來往，待核準發下，不知何時。以後切望市府各局做事要快。</p>
<h3>市府實際職員　與預算不相同</h3>
<p>李文杰質詢兩點：（一）審查本年下半年度重編預算時，據調查報告，市府實際職員人數，七八兩月爲四一七七五人，九月爲四一七七二人，十月爲四一一五五人，十一十二兩月爲四三九五九人。但市府送呈之預算中共列五三一五四人，差額達一萬人，是何原因？（二）去年下半年度保警預算費用共卅二億。但至去年十一月份爲止，經常與臨時之支出，已達四十六億之多，十二月份尚不在內。原因何在？唐世昌稱：本人於去年十二月廿四日收到朮政建設捐繳款書，上載限於十二月十九日繳進，復經交涉展至十二月底，但因事忙，至一月四日始繳進，被罰款一成。以後請當局妥善斟酌，將繳款截止期寬限，</p>
<h3>財政賬目·要求公開</h3>
<p>楊撫坐稱：市府喜開新稅，而不喜整理舊稅，市民稅市稅項目之繁與對率之高，莫不皆知。因此要求三點：（一）財政會計當局對預算數字之準確，應負起責任。（二）對稅收之執行，亦須負起責任。（三）財政賬目應絕對公開，儘量公開，迅速公開。</p>
<h3>勞動代役金　似乎不必要</h3>
<p>朱亞撲問：（一）市庫至　　年底止有否盈餘？如有盈餘共多少？（二）卅六年預算中，有義務勞動代役金一項，一般市民對之非常不滿，認爲等於人頭稅，似不必要。鍾玉良稱：郊區寳山等地，糧串每多不合，應請財政局會同地政局共同進行調查登記，俾使有淸理希望。俞傳鼎請財局考查肅淸稽征處人員舞弊行爲。孫震春則稱市校校長向市庫領取經費時，該處職員態度傲慢，每多輕視留難，加以白眼，應請財局令飭以後糾正態度。</p>
<h3>犯有盜賣物資嫌疑　王公遐將送京訊究　同時被拘者尚有周雲龍宋安兩人</h3>
<p>本市前警備部副官處長王公遐少將，於在職期內，犯有盜賣物資嫌疑，有人向南京最高當局控告。頃悉，警備部日前已奉國防部代電，飭該部迅拘王公遐及共犯周雲龍（前警備部副官年中校副官），宋安（前日僑管理處上校科長）等三犯，連同原案，併解國防部軍法處訊辦。警備部奉令後，業於前晩在江灣中訓團部拘獲周雲龍，狄思威路四六七號拘獲宋安，在大西路美儷園七號將王公遐傳案，刻正在整理案卷，即將移送國防部軍法處訊究。</p>
<p>牽涉榮德生綁案汽車</p>
<p>﹝又訊﹞該案之發生，實一盜賣公物案件而起，時間已在一年以前。聞當時某接收之倉庫中，曾告失竊，竊犯事後即被捕獲，當經淞滬警備部軍法處審詢，迄至目前，該犯仍在拘押中·據　當時情形，案情牽連甚廣，因盜賣者所乘之汽車，即為警備部前副官處長王公遐所有（記者按：當時王尤任副官處長，又去年榮德生綁案綁票時之汽車，亦係王所借用）。至該倉庫之　匙則存於日僑管理處總務科科長宋安上校處，故案發後，朱亦被捕。同時警備部副官處之中校副官周雲龍，亦涉及重大嫌疑。後宋被保釋，事情隔一載，近悉警備部奉國防部密令，着將該案有關人員，解京審訊。</p>
<h3>收回跑馬廳　市長表示有希望</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據吳市長昨日在會外表示：收回跑馬廳問題頗有希望，聞跑馬總會可能允許以地易地，但必須准許其在其他所闢之地跑馬，此案尚須經參議會通過後，始可進行交涉。</p>
<h3>開一次會　加一次稅</h3>
<p>朱亞撥又稱：市民以開一次參議會，增加人民一次捐稅，故有還是不要開之言。故希同人對此次市府卅六年度之預算，愼重加以考慮，顧及市民能否負担。</p>
<h3>質詢地政部份</h3>
<p>關於地政部門施駕東稱：請地政局將全市所有公地公佈，以低價租予市民，俾得解決一部份房荒問題。瞿鉞顧錦藻稱：浦東美孚油站朱家橋附近，於淪陷時期曾由日人圈地三百畝，關作高射砲陣地，勝利後居民曾請發還，今無下文，任其荒蕪，未免可惜，請迅予查明，使能墾殖生產。國錦藻又稱：卅五年一月十七日曾登記申州請發給土地執照，至今無結果，去年四月又曾有辦理登記中請，亦無下文，經追詢結果，則答稱此登記紙已遺失，應請查明。俞傳鼎稱：敵僑時期市府非法出賣之公地六百四十餘畝，地政局淸查處理結果如何，並未見報告。又該局舉辦土地登記後所發之土地權狀，常將畝數之數字寫少，而未見有寫多者。黃炳權稱：地價稅已開征，但估價不對，且不顧業王之納稅能力，有地帶相同，而稅額相差達四分之三者，未知根據何種標準估價？</p>
<h3>對限制用電問題　各議員熱烈發言　有的地區限制有的地區並不限制　請問公用局管制能力究竟在那裏</h3>
<p>質詢關於公用局部門，以對限制用電等間題發言較熱烈。張中原稱：捐稅旣要加在市民頭上，而對用電却要加以限制。市民連極微細之用電自由亦沒有，何談其他。王劍鍔稱：對公用局發生整個懷疑，如限制用電係由公用局之命令，至今前法租界地區已經執行，但舊公共租界地區則並無限制，據聞係因美商電力公司不同意之故。現今公用事業有華商，美商，英商，法商等，皆不在國營範圍之內，如無管制能力，公用局簡直無設施必要。現今公用局之切實中心工作究爲何？限制用電，究有多少效果？馬君碩稱：現聞法商已有發電機到滬，限制用電似可取消。趙局長曾言自二月一日起限制辦法可以撤銷，請作切實答覆。</p>
<p>又王維　稱：路燈對於交通方而甚爲重要，上次大會議決請公用局從速添裝，但至今祗及預算一半，是否爲材料短少？或區域管轄問題關係？徐則驤稱：南市居民與中區居民，所盡義務相等，而所享權利不同。此或爲歷史性關係，其中自來水電燈之享受向與中區相同，但至最近，南市常有斷電情事，且有一日數次者，居民甚感不便，請問公用局此舉是否有計劃的，或能否預先通知，以使居民得有準備？</p>
<h3>輪渡票價　不找尾數</h3>
<p>顧錦藻稱：往來東昌路碼頭者每日有一二萬人，公用局規定渡輪票價爲一百六十元，市民備零票旣不易，公用局方面四十元亦遂不找，如此每天額外收入達一百萬元以上，往來碼頭者多為苦力工人，希局方能將適當辦法改善。另東昌路兩旁負責輪渡人員之態度，與敵僞時期無異，亦應予以制止。虞舜稱：街道行車仍極擁擠，關於交道有否澈底改善辦法？而老垃圾橋爲去北火車站及法院捷徑，能否准許三輪車人力車恢復通行？有數綫電車，搭客擁擠，能否增加行駛電車數量？又打電話至東區必須先撥〇二，每不易接通，能否改善？張中原稱：向電話公司添裝分機，答稱「無」。但有許多電器公司存有該項分機，爲商業上方便起見，能否請公用局通知電話公司，對市民自己能買有分機者，准予方便裝設？</p>
<h3>三月不見　禮義廉恥</h3>
<p>又國際飯店屋頂上之禮義廉恥四覽虹燈大字，最近已三月無光，但上海不能無禮義康恥，能否使其重放光明？嚴國楝稱：取締人力車問題，上次大會曾議決在三年後實行，此次一部份國大代表亦王張暫緩取締</p>
<h3>修築馬路忽略兩旁　疏濬河道鷹顧支流</h3>
<p>對於工務局之質詢，嚴國棟稱：工務局現正與警局會同進行調查，未領執照之棚戶，在禁建區域內，將予拆除。但上次大會曾議決在平民住宅未建築完成前，應暫緩取締。施駕東稱，在南市閘北有甚多竹搭之茅屋，希在建築前先予注意。周濂澤質問，目前上海棚戶據調查估計共達六萬多戶，據聞領執照者祗七百多戶，請問工務局所爲何事？侯雋人與瞿鉞質詢關於疏濬河道事稱，工務局僅重大河，而不顧及支流，今後應多注意，以利農田灌溉。本年旣將其列入中心工作，便鷹積極進行。施駕束稱，新築馬路衹重馬路中間，而忽略兩旁。人力車遂亦向中間平坦路走，車輛肇禍之事遂多發生。以後修築馬路工程時，希能注意此點。又稱，旣言整飭市容，為何小東門一帶，尚存有敵偽障礙物？孫震春稱，滬西梵皇渡金家浜一帶，每逢大雨，馬路泥濘，積水難行，希能改善。俞傳鼎稱，局方不能聽信馬路視察員片面之報告，鷹作詳細審查，否則擾民之事情必多。，但至今上海已取渧十分之一，今應予暫　實行。</p>
<h3>娛樂捐　決依照中央規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於本市娛樂捐减稅問題，市參議會頗爲關切，昨據可靠消息：市參議會決將依照中央規定，請市府將娛樂捐减至百分之二十五，市府預算雖仍超出百分之二十五，市參議會將不予通過。</p>
<h3>第十一區塲外菜販　商定暫準設攤辦法</h3>
<p>關於十一區菜塲外之菜攤版向參議會請願一事，昨由參議員唐世昌等，與衛生局長張維，警察局方處長志越，會同商討，結果議定在不違背交通之原則下，暫准設攤，並決定在山海關路菜塲外，正門不準設攤地，以至山海里爲限，後面不準設攤地，以至三德里爲限。其他各處，均暫准沿路邊設攤，不許置於路中，期限暫以二月爲限，惟警局聲明，如確守秩序，而決不有礙交通，至限期時仍可繼續延長，准予設攤。</p>
<h3>電力公司　華籍聘員　請願改善待遇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市電力公司華籍聘員一百六十人，昨派代表沈潼等向市參議會請願，對市府當局强制减低上海電力公司員工待遇，認爲有損害勞資雙方情感融洽。又對公司員工工作高度效能呈請審查事，此項辦法是否經市參議會審查通過，茲以情勢迫切，希望主持正義，依法糾正。當經議長先推黃柄權及葉翔皋二參議員代表接見後報告稱：（一）請願者皆係該公司高級職員，（二）渠等認爲「市府生活指數暹用委員會」所定薪水折扣有所不當，（三）對社會局曾頒「復員時各公用事業公司員工非在六十歲以上或因病不能工作者不得退職」之訓令表示反對。</p>
<p>後因請願代表等要求參議會法規委員會派員接見，議長復派馬君碩朱扶九接見，據代表再表示：（一）生活指數運用委員會之決議，對業夏勞資雙方實行多時之協議，有無法律根據？（二）要求依據公司原來規定，照底薪按市府公布之生活指數賞足發給。（三）社會局所訂員工退職金額遞减辦法，與公司原訂辦法，優劣縣殊，影響工作效能，請照公司原訂辦法辦理。參議員當即允將請願悄形向大會報告，提請法規，社會二委員會審查再復。</p>
<h3>巴黎新邨　發生命案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕重慶南路巴黎新邨內，昨晨發生一謀殺案，被害人係該弄業已任職十二載之司　捕，名蔣福臣，年卅八歲，北平人，住里內Ａ字六十一號。前晚蔣循例祖任夜班値勤，詎至昨晨三時許，適有里內住戶自外歸來，因呼喚開啓鐵門不鷹，其妻賈氏（卅五歲，浙江人）頓生疑竇，急起身在弄內遍尋，迨抵弄底（近四維邨）九十六號前，見蔣仆臥地上，口吐鮮血，撫之已氣絕身死。不覺駭極大號，附近居戶聞聲出視，在昏黃燈光下見蔣頸間留有指甲印二處，顯係生前被人扼喉窒息而死。同時約在一時左右，有人曾聞蔣大呼「你逃」，足聲雜沓，最後猶微聞「救命」聲。惟時値深夜，細雨濛濛，且自「救命」聲後，即聲息全無，故而未疑有他。賈氏旋即投報泰山警察分局，經派員前往調查，在離屍不遠處，發現兇手遺落之呢帽一頂，網綫袋一只，當即携回存案，一而將死者車送同仁輔元堂騐屍所候騐。記者昨赴出事地點調查，據其同事李壽臣告稱，蔣君平時待人接物，和靄可親，且忠於職守，故今晨遭人暗算，恐係歹徒拒捕所致。</p>

<h3>中航公司全體飛行人員　建議中樞改善設備　提出各點認係保障安全最低條件　民航局長抵滬從事督導</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕現在此問之中國航空公司飛行人員，內有中國機師副機師，航行員，無綫電報務員，約七十名，美國機師約三十五名，昨日上書蔣主席宋院長交通部部長俞大維民航局長戴安國。內稱：中國商航飛行，安全設備，殊欠妥美。美國各航空公司所使用之現代航空安全設備，多告缺如。函中並提出若干具體建議，各飛行人員認爲係保障商航飛行安全之最低條件。</p>
<p>渠等認爲此項建議，純爲保障未來航空旅客之安全，及輔助中國航空之健全發展。而各項建議，皆係根據渠等數年來每日飛行之經騐。</p>
<p>各項建議之要點如下：機塲及降落地而之各項障礙，皆須撤除。機塲及跑道須保特究善。兩道燈光須保持充份强度。（中國商航機塲，皆無充份夜航設備）各種非必須之建築，樓塔，溝道皆須撤除。各種飛行無綫設備，應由政府管理及監督。一切機塲應有現代設備之氣象觀察。氣象報告，每日二十四小時應繼續不停。終點之氣象預測及風向應報告所有中途各站。各航空公司與民航局及中國空軍當局應會商一全國一律之空中交通管制。各機站皆應有合格之無終電人員及設備。各終點皆應有合格之修理人員，並儲藏充份器材。該函末稱，上述各項設備，中國商航機塲或全部缺少，或尚欠完備。</p>
<p>又交通部爲切實澈查航空公司之迭次失事，與檢騐中國·中央二公司所有飛機及機塲等各種設備，特派民航局局長戴安國來滬，就地督導，並檢騐一切。茲悉戴局長偕中央公司陳總理卓林等數人，於前日夜車自京來滬，於昨日抵達。戴氏下車後，即驅車往中央公司，稍事休息，下午即驅車往龍華機塲，首召集中國公司機航組及無綫電等各組負責人，詢問起飛之起候標準，電訊聯絡情形，以及降落時之指引技術等問題，當由各組負責人妥爲解答，至五時許始返市區，預定明後日再繼續檢騐各項設備，並隨時召詢二公司各組負責人員。</p>
<p>另據可靠方面消息，二公司負責人，前日抵京後，交部俞部長，即予召見，俞部長對中國公司之再度在靑島失事，甚爲震怒，故對中國公司沈總經理乖詢頗詐，並囑即造具一二一號飛機之失事報告，其他關於二公司之一切設備，兩公司負責人，均擬就詳細資料，面呈俞部長審核中。</p>
<p>﹝又訊﹞中國公司沈總經理，機航組主任華滋等，業於昨日乘去京之專機返滬，據悉，前日飛抵南京上空時，適遇飛雪，專機在上空盤旋二十分鐘後始下降，頗為危險云。又昨日谷地郵運及貨運，均已恢復。</p>
<h3>三客機失事情慘案　膺赦不擬再追究　青島失事情飛機　地檢處偵查中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕去年耶誕節上海三機失事慘案，地檢處吳啓華，曹鴻，季蘇三檢察官曾先後赴江灣龍華塲，親自勘察，及至中國中央兩航空公司查訪，幷向各方面收集材料，同時又行文漢口地方法院檢察處請協助偵查，現正靜待其答覆。唯大赦令已於元旦日頒布，三飛機失事案，兩公司當局縱有業務上過失致人於死之罪嫌，最重本刑亦不過有期徒刑五年，常在赦免之列，故地檢處對其刑專責任，不擬再加追究，然其失職之昝難辭，俟檢察官偵查一有結果，或將全案移送監察使署，予行政上處分。最近中國航空公司平滬終第一二一號機又在靑島失事，地檢處首席檢察官黃亮見報載後，認爲民航機一再失事，對旅客生命毫無保陣，公司如此玩忽職務，應負法律上責任，且此次失事在今年一月五日，已在大赦規定期限之外，不能再享赦免之惠，特於昨日下午諭知撿察官季蘇，沈祖壽共同負責偵查。</p>

<h3>放聲大哭撲倒庭前　頻呼大老爺伸冤　青浦大命案續審　證人顧年林等悲訴慘情　兩個被告一狡賴一裝傻</h3>

<h3>對最近被控有所解釋　丁貴堂招待記者　稱本人不經商不營私不舞弊　問心無愧決不懼人控告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關務署副總務司丁貴堂，昨日下午四時柬邀本市新聞界，以私人談話方式，對於最近被人控告通敵等事有所表示。丁氏歷述渠本人三十年來服務海關，自小職員升至副總稅務司之經過。自稱平日忠誠爲國，剛直耿介，三十年來曾屢次與外籍關員力爭平等權利，爲民族爭取光榮。對於此次被革職之海關職員沈某控告一事，丁氏解釋太平洋爆發後一年間，渠之留滬繼續在海關供職，係奉財政部之命令，暫時留守崗位，渠認爲沈某之控告係屬挾嫌誣告。因自勝利後，財政部爲甄別收復區海關人員，特成立審查委員會（渠本人並不在內），專司其事，規定凡在淪陷區海關任職之高級官員，除確受敵僞監視無法脫離者外，一律予以革職處分。當時查得該沈某任職廣州關稅務司時有與敵僞勾結之文件，當即呈報財政部予以革職並解送地檢處，後因證據不足而得釋放。此人於出獄後，當屢次要求復職並以檢舉爲威脅，本人未予理睬，因此遂有挾嫌控訴之事。至其檢舉書中所列各種罪狀，丁氏昨日一一解釋，指爲「胡說八道」，並稱渠本人不經商，不營私，不舞弊，現所住寓邸，所坐汽車，均爲海關所有，「如一日不幹海關，即一日沒有飯吃。」故問心無愧，決不懼人控告。最後丁氏對於本月六日報章所載有人密告敵產處理局接收倉庫貪汚案中牽涉渠本人一節，據稱此事不特與彼毫無關係，即與江海關亦毫無牽涉，故希望社會及興論界鄭重立論，對於壞人固應制裁，對於好人勿予難堪云。</p>

<h3>輸管會限額分配處　申述分配遲緩原因　進口商登記核許事情宜尚未辦竣　申請輸入品數額又多不合事情實</h3>
<p>（本報訊）輸入臨時管理委員會雲執委會限額分配處處長李幹氏，昨於接見記者時談稱：本處對若干項須由本處分配限額之輸入品，近正加緊計算其限額之分配。惟現因進口商登記核許事宜，尙未辦理完竣，如遽欲對各項輸人品，作統盤之限額分配，事實上殊多困難。且查各進出口商申請轍入品之數額，常有不合理之情事發生。例如單以燃料一項而言，在一季中之申請輸人額，已超過一年之總需要額。類此申請，如隨予核許，則國家外匯資源，將大量外溢，且國內亦無如許需要量。故外界不明眞相，常譴責本處故意延遲限額之分配，殊屬未悉事實眞相。然太處現對若干種主要之輸入品，例如汽油，柴油木材，橡皮，樹膠，羊毛等，無不趕速計算其輸入之限額。此中汽油一項，以其輸入十九皆集中於三五家大公司之手，故性質單純。本年第一委之輸入限額，亦已決定為美金二百五十萬元，在此貨値限額之內，由各公司自行決定裝運散裝或桶裝之汽油。至該項限額之分配，除極小部份保留予各小公司分配外，其他百分之九十以上，本交由各大公司自行分配。然各公司終以分配不均，而仍請由本處代爲核配。將來其他輸入品限額決定後，如各進出口商能自行分配則最佳。否則，本處只得按照各進出口商所塡報之戰前三年及戰後一年間之輸入額，作爲參考資料，而予以合理之分配。</p>
<p>又據職管會執委會秘書處消息，本市進出口商向輸管會申誚登記者，已超過四千家。外埠數字，尙未在內，該會近正加緊審核中。已核准者，已由該會分發通知書個別通知。惟核准家數若干，尙未結出。外傳三百家之說，完全不確。聞該會核准完畢後，將有公吿發表云。</p>
<h3>央行雖有配售　金價步步高升　較前漲起十二萬</h3>
<p>烚赤昨賡續俏利，央行不時管制市况多盤，晨開三五六萬有買，上場時在三五七萬左右盤旋不已，迄無特變，十時後，央行以三五八萬之價，配給二四六條後，金融幫及進口商等需求更殷，而回升至三六〇萬外，高價達三六五萬，央行逢高仍有壓力，曾回跌至三六〇萬關邊，惟實銷仍因時令而見暢，午刻仍屹立於三六五萬左右排徜，午後隔日交割曾迫三七〇萬關，央行仍來力售，低價曾退至三六四萬，結束時仍站三六九萬左右，較前收漲起十二萬，飾金掛升至卅八萬，銀元續升，暗拆銀根尙平，暗息站一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣蝗較為平穩，美鈔暗盤晨初六二五〇元至六三五〇元，午刻回升至六五〇〇元高價，午後金價優騰，形勢尙穩，結果較前收漲起一五〇元，港票亦稍見趨榮，結果較前收升二十元，港匯因申電回跌，稍吿上漲，昨一一四〇元左右，略有成交，印匯一四〇〇元，英匯一八四〇〇元，兩者仍屬有行無市，美匯牌價仍平。</p>
<h3>多頭陸續出籠　公債逐漸回跌</h3>
<p>公債昨多頭續有出籠，五〇三室等咸加脫售，於是統丙晨開二五〇〇元，即吿爭賣，逐漸回跌至一八五〇元以下，而後稍平，臨收徘徊，結果較前收回跌六五〇元，甲乙跌四〇〇元，丁戊各降五〇〇元，成交約四百餘萬元</p>
<h3>人絲將有到貨　市場漲風已息</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲因傳將有到貨，故漲風已息，終日盤旋，卒做上日原盤，三〇號有光高山開盤喊三百卅七萬元，旭字做三百三十五萬元，後有實銷者吸收幾箱，乃又喊高二三萬元，迄午收盤三百四十萬元，一二〇號旭字半光討價三百八十萬元，終鮮成交，廠經依舊平穩，交易亦甚寂寥，喊價與上日相仿無更，綢貨被面殊形疲軟，成交殊稀，華錦縐因原料提高，喊價每碼三千六百元，但買戶束手觀望，致乏交易做開。</p>
<h3>行莊在港設分支行　均經財部核準　變相設立不用分行名義銀錢業公會亦無法干與</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部為防止上海資金向香港逃避起見，曾飭令本市銀錢業公會，凡各行莊擅自在香港設立分支行者，限令到後五日內撤銷報部，並將辦理情形具報，如藐視法令，延不遵辦者，即予嚴懲不貸，記者特以此事，往詢銀錢業公會負責人，據云此項命令係在去年年底接到，銀行方面在香港設立分支行者，雖有數家，惟設立以前，皆經過財部核准，並無搜自設立情事，現銀行公會已據財部命令，通函各會員，錢莊方面沈日新氏云，據彼所知，各錢莊並無在香港設立分行者，如或改換名目，不用分行名義，在香港設立錢莊，則事實上無需經過財部之核准，其內幕亦無從調查，且目前香港各行莊，利息甚低，若干英商銀行，且有存款不給利息者，普通銀行利息，大約存款爲一二厘，放款亦僅六厘，故上海行莊向香港移動，亦僅能保持原有資金而已，非資力雄厚，別有他圖者，實無此種必要，現錢業公會已據令通函各會員，唯不法設立之分行撤銷報部者，則未有所聞。</p>

<h3>京滬兩市書業代表　為文化危機呼籲　昨在首都招待新聞男人味</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕京滬兩市書業同業公會，八日下午三時，招待新聞界，到滬方晋京請願　衣劉季康，姚蓬子，徐啓堂，徐筱雲，陸實忠，王豐榖，徐伯昕，京方代表黃仲康等，及記有十餘人。首由姚蓬子報吿淪陷時及勝利後上海出版業之情况，謂目前的政局之影響，印刷工料成本倍增，市塲及購買力則日减，巳而臨重大危機。</p>
<p>出版機構隨開隨閉</p>
<p>新創辦之出版機構，隨開隨閉，自後方復員者三十六家，巳有十家停頓，出版業與其他各業不同，其成品旣不能貿然漲價，或抵押借款，成品之銷行亦復受交通及時效之影響，資金週轉不易，前次曾進京請願，請求政府　免營業稅，俾資扶植文化，迄無結果，故又晋京，聯合京市同業，再度請願。惟據非正式消息，敎科書得全部免除營業稅，其他書籍，則减半征收，其營敎科書及不兼營敎科書之出版機稱，對此均表不滿，一則國家之文化，非僅賴敎科書可得發展，二則新聞紙可完全免稅，同為文化效力之書業，應事同等待遇。</p>
<p>圖書郵遞力謀改善</p>
<p>七日曾至直接稅署，及經濟交通兩部，除王雲五部長表示鬨情，允予轉達意見外，交部凌鴻勛次長亦接受攷慮，各代表提出取消戰時頒佈之岡書小包寄遞辦法之請求，並即邀郵政總局負責人員，有所垂詢，允於合理範圍內，力謀改善今後寄書辦法。至稅務方面，因財部生管，忙於應付參政會對預算之審核，尚無結果，巳另由代表於八日午後再往財部請願，希與論界能鼎力協助，共維國家文化命脈。</p>
<p>半免消息聲明不確</p>
<p>姚詞舉，徐啓堂氏略予補充後，即由甫自財部歸來之請願代表徐伯昕報吿，財部李次長接談兩點：第一李氏否認中央社報導書業營業稅全免半免之消息，為官方發表，直接稅署迄未發出是項公吿，財部對此事，尙在研究與攷慮之中，將儘速有所決定。第　李氏肯定「書業」與「報業」同為文化事業，毫無疑問云。</p>
<p>財部方面反應頗佳</p>

<h3>全運會的舉行　和滬市的準備</h3>
<p>第七屆全國運動，的舉行與否，在兩個月前的京滬平津各報，刋有很多的消息，而且統含有該勵的意思。終於敎育部發出一個側面新聞，說全運定明年（即本年）雙十節在首都舉行，於是關於全運舉行日期及地點的推測，吿一段落，靜行政府明確的公布，然而迄今未見下文。許多熱心的朋友，爭着要問個究竟，但是</p>
<p>大概政府正忙着政治上的實大事情，無暇及此；或者政局尙未十分平靜，有所顧慮；或者經費問題有所困難；確實原因何在，我們不得而知。假使因為以上的原因而被擱置，我以為不成理由，運動會的籌備，另有技術上的人材來辦理，與政治活動並不衝突；運動會參加單位是各省市及特別區域，現在各省市與由央間並無問題，可以保證百分之百的派隊出席，就是交通上略有困難，亦非無法解決，况且十個月以後或許根本沒有困難；至於經費，算來運建築在內不過百餘億，決不會使財政上束手無策。</p>
<p>復員一年，其他各部門均有相當成就，獨有體育還是一籌莫展，我們不敢說政府不肯致力提倡，至少敢說是沒有巷埀危的體育打一次强心針。全國運動會確可當作强心針看待，全國各地方的體育就盼望在此一針之下活動起來，然而這一針拿在手裏而不肯打下去，我們在着急，為乘危的體育着急</p>
<p>從體育行政上說，運動會本是一種手段，而不是目的，只要政府明白公佈全國運動會於今年雙十節在首都舉行，也時於給垂危的全國體育一服強心劑，全國體育就會活躍起來　，何況實際舉辦並無不可能呢？光陰是比飛機快吧？轉瞬就是雙十節的來臨，我們希望政府下一個決心，立即把準備時的強心劑灌進體育的病口，接着把拿在手裏的強心針打入體育的病體。</p>
<p>上海是上屆全運會的地主，亦是上屆全運會總錦標的得主，上海體育向不肯落人之後，無論全運會是否能在本年雙十節舉行，上海體育界必須從事準備，準備着保持我們過去的榮譽。準備的工作自然要分鬥別類的去做，然而應該有一區通盛的計劃。整個的計劃應該由教育局國民體育委員會會同布體育協會理事會來訂定，各門各艱的技術問題司以市體育協曾的各委員會為基礎，擴大組織來辦理。</p>
<p>我所希望於準備工作的，不像過去在會前幾個星期選拔些特優人才，凑合起來就算，而要從現在起，注意物色可造之材，指定負責的指導員去用種種的方法試騐，最後加以組織和訓練。假使不是這樣的做，不但會埋沒新進的人才，而且從球隊來講，我們只能得到五個九個或十一個好手，而得不到一個好球隊。</p>
<p>上海有很多熱心的體育家，有經騐的指導員，更有無量數的新舊運動人才，如果能由主管體育行政機關和體育團體合作主持，一定可以得到優異的結果，以待全運會的來臨，否則亦可應付埠際的挑戰或出征他邑，收獲提高運動水準的效益。（偉）</p>

<h3>張家口在重建中</h3>
<p>— 本報記者俞振基</p>
<p>政復將近三個月的張家口，至今仍在半警戒狀態中。城中滿街都是堡壘，沿途到處可見鐵網。入晚後，一過九點，全城即入戒嚴狀態，路上看不到一個行人，祇有戴皮帽穿大衣荷槍實彈的戍卒於零下近十度的酷寒中守衛着，在半明不暗的燈光下，拖着一條長長的影子份外見得緊張。京滬記者團在張垣時，就曾因戒嚴而發生過如下一個笑話。</p>
<h3>一張照片　變成臨時通行證</h3>
<p>是十二月卅日晚上，記者團坐了小跑車——或許就是長官自己的乘車——從長官部辭行出來，於主人慇懃招待之下，每人都喝了一些塞外著名的葡萄酒，在車上談着白天在崇禮看到的慘狀。車過淸河橋後，市街益見狹隘，行駛亦漸遲緩，正要轉最後一們灣時，堡壘旁的戍卒，突然將車攔住，要問口令。這可把記者們難住了，唯一的希望是司機或許知道，不想此公亦因臨行匆匆，事先未注意及此，記者等雖一再解說，我們是從長官部出來的京滬記者團，但士兵因執行命令，仍堅不放行，如是者僵持有兩分鐘之久。最後，還虧有一個同業有急智，將傅長官送給我們每人一張親筆簽名的大照片給士兵看，才算順利通行。事後大家笑着說：「想不到傅長官的照片還可當臨時通行證用：」記者所以提起這個故事，只想說明察省雖已全部收復——然因到處仍有散股共軍，治安當局不得不做着「居安思危」的戒備工作。就是傳長官本人亦承認「察綏兩省不能說不受威脅。」　這種不安定的情形，對於張垣以至整個察省的復興，當然有其重大的影響。在張垣從事救濟工作的某行總人員即特別强調此點。記者和張茲文，亦從某可靠方面獲悉，十二月廿九日晚，張垣曾發現一　動陰謀，幸事先發覺，得以撲滅。</p>
<p>分不出長官與士兵</p>
<p>儘管察哈兩全境尙未全部安定，儘管張家口至今仍受着一些或大或小的威脅，但這一切却不能阻止省當局對復興工作的努力。在記者所接觸的十幾個隨軍入張的人士談話中，他們幾異口同聲贊美張垣在道不到三個月時期中復興的迅速。有一個汽車駕駛員吿訴記者，國軍初人張垣時，城內到處都埋有地雷，尤其是公路及工廠一帶，現在掃雷工作已全部完成了。最初全城電燈都給破壞了，現在靠着一部年邁龍鐘的萬機器，城中晚上已經可以重睹光明了，麪粉廠的輪子亦開始轉出一袋一袋混合麪。</p>
<p>推動這些工作的，都是些埋頭苦幹不求聞達的志士，他們有的貴爲主席廳長，有的曾留學外國，但所穿的只有兩種制服，一種是草黃色的棉軍服，頭上戴了一頂兩邊蹺起的皮帽，遠望像一個下級軍官；一種是黑棉制服，（很少呢的），因爲他們服裝如此樸素，所以常常爲記者所誤認。張家口市長周鈞，就曾因爲他穿了「大布之衣」，在機塲迎接記者時，沒有引起注意。察省財政廳長白寳璋亦吿訴記者，他上次隨傳長官到首都時，因爲怕黑棉制服見不得人，臨時趕製了一些新裝。</p>
<p>一般公務員待遇都差得很，尤其是從緩遠調來的，侮人僅給三萬元津貼，他們就在人錢兩缺的情形下工作。平緩路通車後，張家口的物價幾已與平津拉近，但這次公務員待遇調整，平津京滬同列爲第一級，而張家口則爲第三級，與蘭綏相同，未免太不公平。白廳長等很希望記者們能代爲呼籲。但說明在這國家經濟情况窘迫的時候，公務員暫時吃些苦亦是應該的，只要他們所做的工作，對國家民族有利，錢少一些亦是甘心的。這些話實足以代表多數察省公務員的意思，而整們張家口以至察省的復興就逮築在這種堅靭的意志上。</p>
<h3>從廢墟中站起來</h3>
<p>記者生長滬濱，抗戰後足跡又曾遍及西北西南各省，但在後方這許多大都市中，所見烟囪最多的都市，很少有能與張家口比擬的。這次同行的中外記者，對張市工業基礎的良好，亦無不同表驚愕，遺憾的是破壞得太厲害了。汽車從飛機塲駛入市區途中，一路都是斷垣殘壁，彷彿走過上海江灣一帶。</p>
<p>據可靠調查，察省工電機構共有七十七個單位，屬於工廠性質者十個，屬於半工廠性者九個，規模過小仍未脫離副業性者五十八個，其中四十家就在張家口，而這四十家幾乎完全被破壞了，無怪傅長官沉痛的說：「破壞容易建設難，共產黨一夜半天所做的破壞工作，我們到現在當無法完全恢復過來。」</p>
<p>話雖這樣說，經過將近三個月的努力，殘渣是剷除了，烟囪是豎起了，若干工廠的輪子又重新轉動了。據調查在上述七十七個單位中，巳整理者有五十四個，在整理中者亦有廿三個。其中一待電力供應無問題即可復工者有十九家，根本不能復工者十七家，餘者欲求復工，房屋機械均須大加修理。　此外，當局又在毘連共軍地區搶運搜集機械器材（大部殘缺不全）六百噸，一百餘噸已運回，其餘正在搶運中。</p>
<p>最嚴重的電力問題</p>
<p>偶爾停電一兩分鐘即大罵電燈公司的京滬人士，是無法想像電力缺乏義張家口造成了何種嚴重狀態。張家口不是沒有過電的，日寇佔領期間，曾計劃在察建立六萬五千瓩電力供應網，其中四萬瓩已完成，最著名的則是下花園發電廠，（日寇在那裏建有兩萬瓩的發電機，）但經三次破壞後，張坦所剩的電力已不滿一千瓩。因爲缺電工廠的機輪無法轉動，連累成萬工人失業，因爲缺電，麵粉廠的磨子無從推動，成千成萬升斗小民生計都受了影響　記者們逗留張垣的短暫時期中，曾至碩果僅存的此發電廠作半小時的參觀。</p>
<p>據張股長告訴我們該廠所用的機器在日本人時代是早已棄置不用了的，光復後才從新把它找出來，重加修理，烟囪還是從別處搬來的。因爲是老牛破軍，所以只能發三一二瓩，當然不能負起全部供電任務，至今張市用電的商家還是不多。這位電力界的老前輩，領我們去看鍋爐，又指着堆棧裏的煤塊對我們說：「鍋爐雖是美國威斯丁霍斯廠的出品，但到底是高齡了，而煤塊，你們看，一燒就結成了渣，非常常洗不可，我們每天下午五時開爐，晚間十二時休息淸爐，淸晨一點再開，亮到五點，八點再開一直到下午三點，這樣住家與工廠都有電了，尤其是麵粉廠，麵粉太重要了，老百姓沒有麵粉吃怎末得行！」</p>
<p>他吿訴我們大同或許有兩個三千瓩的破機器搬來，再加上六七千萬塊錢就可以開動了。資委會亦可能有一個五百瓩的機器搬來，全部開動時可有三千瓩，如是一則火柴廠烟廠等都不難次第復工一下花園的大電廠已由資源委員會接管了，該會所派郵凌雲及全體員工已於上月二十日到達、第一步工作是檢查破壞情彩，一俟竣事，即可從事配修裝補，因破壞情形尙不厲害，兩三個月內可望恢復舊觀，屆時發電量可達一萬瓩，除供給下花園張家口外，尙可供給宣化等地。</p>
<p>與電同樣重要的是煤，入冬以後，張垣氣侯老是在零下十幾度，一位記者藏在箱中的墨水瓶亦因天冷而凍裂了，街上老年人連鬍髭都結了冰珠，沒有煤是無法禦寒的。張垣附近最大的煤礦是寳興煤礦，傳長官近曾撥流動資金三千萬元，協助重建，該礦有工人千餘名，工作情緒都極高，每提煤一體，足够四百斤；農民利用農閒時間採掘煤副業者亦多，目前每日可出有烟煤與無烟煤三百噸，假使下花園電力恢復。四坑都出煤，產量可增到四百餘噸。該礦又自行磨電，裝燈二百餘盞，光亮可與張垣相比。</p>
<p>省府最近又曾派員至下花園視察各礦礦務及業務，以爲增產準備，對於礦業安全亦將採某種有效措置，所以張垣等地煤荒問題不久即可解決。</p>
<h3>大動脈再度躍動</h3>
<p>國人自行設計自行出資建成的平綏路，最近又全綫通車了，這事對張家口的復興非常重要。</p>
<p>平緩路張間段的搶修工作是十二月十二日完成的，該日東西兩搶修隊在羅文皂接軌，平綏路全綫通車的工作乃吿完成。自上月二十一日起，張問間每日有兩次列車各往返一次，便利客運不少。</p>
<p>平綏路所受的戰爭損失是相當重大的，該路對此曾有一個總的關查，到現在翻閱損失淸册時，仍令人心悸手顫。記者們曾到火車站去參觀，站上滿堆着修屋用的石灰，鐵軌上停了幾輛漆得紅紅綠綠的壓道車，辦公室都是空落落的，景象是够凄闵的了。經過三轉五問，才找到了一位姓陳的當班副站長，也正忙於打電話，旁邊站着四五個商人模樣的人，屋子本來不够大，平添了四五個記者，益見得狹隘。</p>
<p>「昨天一共裝了七個車的皮糧，今天恐怕還要多，客人催得很急，您得想個辦法……」副站長對着電話直嚷，站在旁邊的客人都以焦灼的眼光望着他。這電話足足打了三分鐘，其間又進來了好幾個客人。最後副站長看我們等得太久了，才讓我們坐下，第一句話就說：「實在太忙了，累諸位久等，抱歉得很。一</p>
<p>據他吿訴我們，張家口積壓的貨相當多，客人催得很緊，因爲沒有車皮，貨物有三四天運不出的，從張家口運往北平的以白麵，小米，黃米，豬肉等物爲大宗，最近長官部曾口頭通知，禁止糧食肉類大宗出口，但小量仍有運出，每天約有三四個車皮。北平運來的物品則以布匹雜貨機件需多，數量無法估計。</p>
<p>西段方面，雖然已經通車了，但爲安全計，晚間不行車，同時客運亦不多，從大同一帶裝來的，以食糧及煤炭爲多，大炭都爲口泉出產。</p>
<p>目前主要的困難是機車及車皮不够，沿綫橋樑都是臨時修的，開春尙得大加修建，因爲缺水，煤質又不好，火車往往要誤一兩個鐘頭，有時甚至誤到一夭，過去火軍每小時可走六七十　　，現在最快只能走二三十里，最壞時每小時只走十里，跟人走差不多快。　平綏路通車後，對張家口有好的影響亦有壞的影響，就好的方面說，張垣與晋綏冀的物資靠着這條鐵路溝通了，壞的方面，張垣的物價漸漸與平津拉平，老百姓感到生活的重壓。張垣的皮貨本來相當便宜，通車後，因爲平津來張辦貨的人很多，價格就漲了，著名的葡萄，以前只買兩百元一斤，現在漲到一千多元一斤。此外平綏路通車後當然亦運來一些美國香烟之類的東西，所好數量尙不頂多。</p>
<p>除了鐵路以外，張垣附近的公路亦已全部修竣。最近修復的，有龍關赤城公路，十二月廿七日曾舉行試車，成績良好。</p>
<p>皮貨業及工商現狀</p>
<p>憑記者在張兩天視察的觀感，張家口商業情形雖然相當呆疲，但是一般尙稱平穩，最低限度過陽曆年底或陰曆年底的，不致於發生如京滬平津工商業一樣的危機。關於這點，記者曾詢問過當地人土，他們的解釋是：張家口收復未滿三月，一切尙在復員狀態中，所感缺乏的只是資金不足，尙不致有其他嚴重問題。</p>
<p>爲了好奇心驅使，記者們對張垣的皮貨業都相當注意，臨行一天尙到幾家最大的皮貨店中去看了一下。</p>
<p>據熟悉該業者談：皮貨最近半個月生意相當好，除了皮裘業門市零星銷售外，山，老羊皮因爲天氣漸冷，口外糧車入境，一般農民及跑口外商販紛紛購裘皮褲皮襖，所以一般皮貨都較鬆動，價格粗皮每件大者的十二萬，小者的十萬左右。至於生皮張與各種毛類，因天津商家不來採購，仍相當呆滯。</p>
<p>除皮貨業外張垣主要出口品有糧食藥材等項，雜糧最近因爲口裏口外農民來張糶糧”每日上市貨由一千餘石漲至一一千石左右，主要雜糧如小麥小米玉米高糧每石均落五百至一千不等。北平及察東各地糧客，因運輸困難，不再貪購，供過於求，糧價隨之而瘦，尤以油糧類如胡蔴菜子等爲甚，價格由每石四萬三四，跌至三萬五六，相差有萬元之鉅，小麥銷路尙暢，仍保持三萬價格。</p>
<p>張垣是一個貨物集散地，本身沒有多大的消費量，到貨　擠，往往易生跌價現象。最近煤油及紙烟等外來物品，即曾因來貨過多，價格下落，甚至有較平津更賤者。記者等在張時，煤油價的爲二十二萬一大　，紙烟一大箱跌至十萬元左右，市上銷行最好的是上海出品的咖啡。小哈德門，單刀等香烟銷路甚呆，至張垣本地烟廠出品，幾無人問津。這種情形與其他各地並沒有什麼不同。</p>
<p>敎育復員成績美滿</p>
<p>在張垣整個重建過程中，敎育復員成續該是最爲令人滿意的。周市長曾以驕傲的口吻向記者們報吿，張垣中小學如何在一兩個星期之內次第復校的情形。張家口原有三十九所小學，現在已全部復校了，敎職員人數亦自一百九十三人增至二百三十五人，班級數亦增加了三十八班，自一五八級增至一九六級，學生人數亦目七千一百人增加至七千七百二十七人，加添了六二七人。這將近一萬的小學生，在京滬一帶看來沒有什麼希奇，但請記住，張家口目前總人口尙不到十四萬人（最初光復時僅十二萬多）小學生所佔的比例是不能算小的。</p>
<p>當局對各小學敎員殊爲軫念，先後曾撥發臨時救濟費十一萬元，最近敎部又撥下一千五百萬作爲失業敎師與失學靑年的救濟金，對於從事淸苦生涯的敎書匠當不無小補。</p>
<p>張垣原有中學四所，現在省中與省師已經復課了，省中爲救濟失學靑年計，奉准增加班次，最近尙舉行一次新生考試。此外塞北中學亦籌備復校，傳長官允在收回校產與黨措經費代爲設法，春季或可開課。</p>
<h3>空校狂歡之夜</h3>
<p>— 一月五日杭州訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>卅五年除夕的白天，卅多架曾經橫越駝峯的司蒂曼練習機，在杭州的空中大編隊成「三十六」三字，這是啓示給杭州的市民：「卅六年年到了，我們將以什麼來迎取她呢」？</p>
<p>當晚，中國空軍的搖籃——筧橋空軍軍官學校有一個盛大的聯歡會，我也被邀參加，同行約有善後救濟總署浙江分署署長孫　樓和副署長祝脩爵兩位先生，我們通過了車輛頻繁的去筧橋公路，又通過了空軍學校的警衛，直達空軍學校的大禮堂前，那高大的洋樓上綴着電炬築成的「卅六」兩個阿拉伯字這學校的四週，所有一幢幢的房屋，機塲上的設備，都燈燭輝煌，光明燦爛，好像今天這中國空軍的搖籃，已被寶石所點綴着了。</p>
<p>笑聲酒氣蕩漾</p>
<p>車停了下來，拉開車門，便有英姿煥發的空軍官佐招待我們，在白綾上簽了名，卸了大衣，過大禮堂，到昔日我們常來的會客室，已是賓朋滿座了，這裏有華貴的女賓，英武的空軍官佐，我們被逖登樓，很多人已先我們而至。政治部主任祝桓壽氏，很熱烈的過來拉着手，介紹他們的空軍高級官佐以及他的太太，教育長胡偉克也來了，笑着說：「來了，好極了，我們正設法接你們呢」！</p>
<p>友邦的陸空官佐也絡繹蒞止，他們帶着目己漂亮的太太和女友，胡敎育長夫人穿着紫紅色的毛織品短旗袍，黑空花的全高跟鞋，來回的招呼着賓客。浙省主席沈成章氏秘書長雷法章氏，杭州市長周企虞氏也都一齊來了，一陣愉快的笑聲震盪在樓室裏。</p>
<p>碰杯互祝進步</p>
<p>酒筵是中菜，樓外樓的，我們這一桌是敎育處副處長趙珊氏主人，他殷勤的勸着酒，他說他的太太不會喝，但也喝了七八杯了。胡敎育長又來敬酒，他是豪爽痛快的個性，一口氣就乾了好多杯，大個十祝主任又來敬酒了，於是激起了賓客們的還敬，尤某是友邦的官佐們，他們以絕對壓倒的姿式來向主人和中國客人乾杯，這個强大的威力終於被抵抗住了，「哈，哈，哈」；一片「哈哈哈」洋溢在戶外。</p>
<p>趙副處長已經乾了七十餘杯了，他再三吿訴我，在杭州市裏應該成立一個航空俱樂部，可使民間與空軍打成一片，他說：「外國人對航空的興趣眞濃厚，我們中國人視之如畏途的正大有人在呢」？所以，他主張提倡航空興趣，提倡航空事業，提倡空中活動，他拉着我的膀子說：「這事要努力鼓吹呢」！</p>
<p>沈主席站起來了，他說：「今天剛從外縣回來，本來正當除夕，應該在家裏過的，但空軍學校直等於是我們的家，我行裝甫卸，就趕來了，我們眼見中國空軍逐漸成長，我們感着無比的興奮，今天我要乾杯，來祝中國空軍健康進步，說友邦人士健康進步」。碰杯乾杯聲重又四起，激成了又是一片歡快的熱浪。</p>
<p>參加音樂舞會</p>
<p>酒興闌珊，每個女士的臉上像塗得更紅了，男賓們也正是薰薰欲醉的時侯，我們又被邀參加音樂舞會，下樓經大禮堂時，航校劇團正演着曹禺編的「原野」，禮堂黑匯壓的一片人，，靜止得毫無聲息，我們探頭禮堂內，淸晰的台詞聽得很淸楚。</p>
<p>這是圖書館吧？臨時佈置成的舞廳，幽美的燈光像浴在溫暖的泉水中，一條條藍色綴着朵朵雪白花絮的條子，挕在舞廳中益增無限美感。女子樂隊奏起了樂曲，周市長和友邦一位女士首先起舞，接着胡敎育長夫婦跟踵而起，小小的休息室中一位外國年老的夫人問：「請去跳舞吧」？</p>
<p>胡敎育長之母</p>
<p>胡敎育長舞罷他爲我介紹他的母親，原來就是這位外國年老的夫人，我才知道她是英國籍的，她拉住我坐在她坐的沙發上，她說：「我的孩子生出來後，許多英國朋友問我爲什麼讓他進中國學校呢？我說他本來是中國人啊！」她吿訴我她喜愛中國，她愛中國人的自由和平，她認中國是有前途的，有希望的啊。她又吿訴我：「你看這許多空軍軍官，多天眞，活潑，熱情哪！」</p>
<p>胡敎育長又吿訴我，他希望介紹這個學校的全體官生，而不必介紹他自己，因爲他正被這許多官生的天眞活潑，熱情底可愛的情愫所引誘着呢？是的，這許多空軍官生，他們却頂酷愛自由的呢？但他們的自由是大民族的自由，如果有人侵犯了大民族的自由，他們會犧牲自己的自由來換取大民族的自由的。他們酷愛國家，民族的自由，甚至可以說也酷愛人類的自由。</p>
<p>一位官佐吿訴我：「你別看今夜這樣的頑皮，在平日訓練的時侯，遠不及友邦訓練空軍的待遇，在作戰的時侯，正也同於一般平民的生活，中國自己根本窮困，咱們不能好高驚遠，在建設的過程中，只有大家吃苦啊！」</p>
<p>市長舞姿準確</p>
<p>周市長又與胡敎育長夫人跳舞了，這舞廳裏滿滿地擠着，大概有四十多來對吧。胡敎育長一忽兒去舞，一忽兒又到休息室來招呼客人，一忽兒又在舞應四週的桌椅上坐着，官佐們送着蜜橘，一個個遞到賓客們的手中。</p>
<p>我笑着對周市長說：「你的舞姿與舞法至爲準確。」周市長說：「謝謝你，我是遵守着嚴格的跳舞規則的。」　我又對胡敎育長夫人說：「胡太太舞得眞好。」她笑着說：「你沒有和我舞過，怎曉得我舞得好呢？」幸虧孫署長在旁邊解了圍，他說：「他是欣賞家啊！」</p>
<p>愉快，興奮，狂歡的一九四六年空軍官校的除夕夜。</p>
<p>夜幕愈深，我想回去了，周市長要記者再留一回，一齊回來。胡敎育長拉着記者說：「不能走，舞一下吧？等回派車送你回去。」</p>
<p>歸來，這天眞，活潑，熱情的狂歡影子不停地在腦際映演着。尤其這大禮堂前「卅六」的兩個阿拉伯字，我正不知拿什麼來迎接這卅六年的到來！</p>

<h3>評「理性與民主」</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>作者　張東蓀　出版　商務印書館</p>
<p>「民主二字愈成濫調，則必致離眞正實現民主愈遠」</p>
<p>這本書是張先生在抗戰剛勝利的時候完成的，可說是對於中國前途的一本理論著述，比他以前的兩本者作（即知識與文化及思想與社會）所討論的問題較爲具體，但是我還是認爲張先生是在從原則上來談中國的前途。所以他有兩點他是可以把握的，第一是世界必須和平；第二是中國必須民主。道乃是原則上的認識，而道個原則是大家都應該承認的。</p>
<p>張先生說得好，民主不祇是一種政治制度而是一種有特色的文明。換句話說，民主更不是少數人嘴裏所喊出口號而應是一種切切實實的生活習慣，這種習慣不是機械的盲從，而應是受人類理性的指導的。</p>
<p>本畫的主題可以歸納成功四點：（一）人類文明的進步應受理性的指導；（二）個人應自覺的表現自己的人格；（三）人類應運用理智以處理人事；（四）人類應發揚自由平等的民主精神。最後張先生再根據這幾個原則來解決中國的國是</p>
<p>（一）文明進步</p>
<p>張先生把人類的歷史分成三個時期：在人類有史以前是第一期，這時的人在不自覺的深淵中潛藏有一種「死之威脅」的心理上的鬱結，他們衹有乞訴於宗敎，他們服從，他們摸拜，他們安心於靈魂不朽的信仰上。第二個時期是從有史以來到最近一二百年爲止，這時期的人在心理上受着一種生的威脅，這是一種彼此搶奪鬥爭的生活，這時的社會把人類訓練成功各種機詐狡猾殘忍偽善的心理，人們在時候是强凌弱，富壓貧，點欺愚。這種社會是「病社會」，這樣的文明是醜文明。現在已有萌芽在第二期以外，幾乎要開第三期了，這個時期便是科學的昌明和理性的抬頭。張先生說：「第二期中幾乎完全是病社會和醜文明，乃幸而其中漸漸把理性榨出來，擠出來，逼出來。並且愈榨愈出，愈擠愈大，愈逼愈多。從一個狹小夾縫放出理性，却不料理性回頭來猶如探海燈一樣而仍照在這個夾縫的本身。理性的功甩並不全在於能爲未來設想，要建議一個合理的社會與合理的人生乃反而在能對於社會的病態與人性的缺點爲之戳穿，爲之揭破」。這個時期的文明乃是科學的共同主義，「其順序是出於客觀的自然演化，而不需有預定的旣定公式」。這一個似乎很受柏格森創化論的影響，祗是柏格森的主力是「生命之力」而張先生乃是「理性之力」或「智力」。</p>
<p>（二）人格與人性</p>
<p>文明的進步必須有精神自由，要精神自山必須有人格成立。所以張先生說：「這三者是不可分的」。人格觀念是西方文化的中心，也是建立西方民主主義的基礎。張先生引用魯盡罷在他的「歐洲自由主義史」中的話說：</p>
<p>「自由乃對於一己及其無限的精神價値之自覺，故同時亦必須承認他人同具有此。只有能覺得其本身自由者始承認他人之自出」。</p>
<p>我應自覺我是一個人，我有我做人的特權，我旣有我的人權，那末我們使也應覺得別人也是人，他們也應有人權。自由平等的觀念，便是在這種自我意識發展的過程中建立起來的。這是西方文明的特色。在中國文明有與此類似者便是儒家的「人倫」觀念。所以注意中國文化前途的人今後的問題只在於如何使儒家的人格觀念和西方民主主義文化上的人格觀念融化爲一。</p>
<p>（三）理智與條理</p>
<p>「理性」可以從兩方面來解釋。一方面可以解釋說，理性就是人類的理智，這是指人類對於自然界或社會的一種認識，這種智慧又包括兩方面：一方面是認識事物的因果關係，從這種因果關係中去預測事後的效果；另一方面是抽擇事理的邏輯關係，從道種推演的過程中去求得己知事理中的涵意。這是屬智識一方面的，它是不斷的發展，不斷的增進的。「理性」一辭在另一方面我們也可以解釋爲人倫關係中的入情入理的態度，這是屬於做人的態度方面的。平時我們說某人做事很合乎情理。現在的人們合乎情理的不一定是知識淵博的，而知識淵博的人對人往往又是並不合乎情理的。這種情理是亙古不變的。這種情理是祗能體會而來而不能言語傳受。西方人重智慧，中國人重情理。所以張先生主張今後中國必須重振傳統的「講理之風」，而同時又必須如西方人之磨練理智，提高理想。</p>
<p>（四）自由與民主</p>
<p>自由乃是一個道德上的觀念。自由就是人與人之間有合理的結合。愈合理，便愈自由。張先生說：「中國人以爲民主制度易引起搗亂，自由就是放縱與隨便，平等是以高而遷就於下，殊不知這些乃完全是錯誤。……當知自由，平等，民主，都是道德的爭點。但道德不是責人的，乃只是律己的。必須自己血管裏與丹田中確有民主精神存在；平時一舉一動都有容人立己的意思，方足形成民主的社會。……民主與生活必須打成一片……並且須知自己不民主而希望他人實行民主，這是不可能的。個人如此，政治上的黨派亦是如此。如要辦到這樣，必須澈底立於理性主義上，因爲理性與道德根本是合一的」。</p>
<p>以上是略述張先生的主張，這個略述我覺得對於讀張先生原著的人或者是有帮助的，因爲張先生在著述的時候思想太豐當了，往往拉得很遠，易使讀者如墮五里霧中，張先生自己也深知這一點，所以我們提出他的主題來說一說是有益於讀者的。以下我們預備對於這本書就其內容，方法，和敘述的態度各方面申述一一點意見以就正於東蓀先生和諸位讀者。</p>
<p>關於張先生的理論內容在主題上我們是完全贊同的。例如他說，民主就是個人在生活習慣思想精神上要有自由，而個人的自由就是在人羣中行爲得合理，這是我們完全一致的。但是我們覺得對於自由和民主以及自由與理性的關係，張先生在理論上還沒有充分的發揮。假使把民主當做一種生活態度那末凡有民主精神的人一定是一方面對於自己的生活習慣思想情緒都能自己作主而不盲從別人，更不機械的受別人的支配；對於別人的生活習慣思想情緒也不會妄思統制而斲傷其主動力。但是怎樣的人纔能眞正自主呢？怎樣的人纔能使別人眞正自主呢？自主的人不是放縱隨便，眞正自主的人乃是對於一切事理認識得淸淸楚楚，他的取捨是合乎情理，他的行動是要產生對於人類文化的發展有最大福利的效果，他有認識，有特見，合乎情理，追求福利。使人眞正自主的人是應該帮助別人求得有淸晣認識情境的目光，有正確辨別是非的智慧，有誠摯推己及人的心意。所以我有一個想法，覺得政治家是不會眞正民主的，因爲一個熟心的政治家總希望別人信仰他的見地，服從他的組織，遵守他的紀律。我覺得眞正有民主精神的人乃是敎育家，不過這種敎育家並不是說敎的敎育家，而是帮助別人增進處世做人的理智的敎育家。假使政治家可能是民主的話，那末他一定要以一稱敎育家的態度帮助別人使其善於運用其智慧，愼於決定其取捨，以自主的立塲，追大衆的福利。</p>
<p>在理論內客方面張先生之所以未能暢所欲言，我以爲這和他的研究方法有關。張先生解決問題所用的方法是做學問的方法，所謂做學問的方法張先生一面是用的歷史法，這就是說，張先生是從歷史的演變趨勢中去求出路。這一點我們是贊成的，不過我們覺得張先生太注重於歷史上的思想學說的演變而不够從社會生活和社會心理的演變中找路綫。張先生所用的另一種方法是中西文化同異的比較法，進也是正確的，不過他所比較的仍是中西的幾個特殊概念，至於這幾個特殊概念如何從其特殊的社會背景所產生，張先生還沒有給我們一個更詳細的指示。所以我們覺得張先生仍是在做學問而不在解決實際問題。</p>
<p>張先生在中國學術界是我個人最景仰者的一位，我對於他的尊重是無疑意的，他也自應有他的傲氣，不過在本書中他討論問題的時候對人的態度似欠謙虛，這是我想向張先生進言的。例如他說：「除張君勱先生外，國內最配在言論上對於民主來說話的恐怕就是區區小子了。」又如：「我對於這些問題的意見比較複雜，不是幾句話所能說盡的。……讀者務必要有耐性，方能了解我的主張。」又如說：「這乃是我的創見。」這雖是小疵，然對於讀者心理頗有影響。又如「除了馬一浮梁漱溟熊十力等尙有士君子風度以外，簡直是愈過愈少了，」這話也似嫌說得太具體了。不知張先生以爲如何？</p>
<p>介紹一冊</p>
<h3>中國地形圖</h3>
<p>— 孫盤壽</p>
<p>中國史地圖表編纂社編纂　亞光與地學社出版</p>
<p>作一幅地圖，要粗着使人獲得明晰的印象，細察可以從中尋出多種的意義，正像寫一幅　，要宜於遠觀復足供近賞同樣的不容易，本圖爲作者融和優良的製圖技術與精深的地學素養，作成「中國立體地形大地圖」，却　備　美。</p>
<p>道幅圖是用立體描繪法來表示地形的，全國河山大勢，一眼望去，淸淸楚楚。山地·高原·邱陵·盆地·平原各按其實際形貌與位置，一一展佈圖上，足資讀者細細觀摩，看這幅岡，彷彿看我們這綿延達一千餘萬方公里國土縮成的照片，獲有眞切之感。</p>
<p>照片顯出人物的形貌，五彩照片更渲染出人物的本色，看去當更覺生動，此圖也沒有忘記爲它自己添上各種自然的彩色。康藏一帶，五千公尺以上的高山，終年白雪皚皚，這些地方圖上都蓋上白色，高度較低的高原·山地·和邱陵·或灰或赭或黃，悉據原色分染，平原則普遍覆以綠色，水道，湖泊，海洋各就其深度，分別印上淡藍或深藍色，故此圖又不意爲中國地面形態的一幅五彩照片，注目這些自然的彩色，腦子裹會不期然而然地浮現出各地實在的景象來。另外，圖上將國界，省界，重要都市並予表出，道對於初讀地圖的人，所助尤多。</p>
<p>圖的右下角，附有三四千字的說明，由盧村禾先生執筆，於全國地形的特色，地形區域的劃分，讀岡的方法，都有扼要的敍述，讀者一面研究說明，一面看圖，對中國地形必可得到進一步的認識。</p>
<p>現在許多地理敎師，講述本圖地形，每以不得適當的掛圖爲苦，此圖的出版，對他們實在是一個喜訊；社會上一般人，對於本國地形的概念一向是很糢糊的，這幅圖至少可把全國地面景象的輪廓顯示給他們看，使他們比看一省一色的掛圖，多吸取到一點地理的意味。我寫這篇簡短介紹的用意，是在使讀者先知道此項値得注意的消息，寥寥數百字中並不能盡言此圖的好處，好在它即將行世，大家要瞭解其眞實價値，還請詳讀原圖。</p>
<h3>「恐懼與無畏」</h3>
<p>— 陳述</p>
<p>一部小說體的戰史</p>
<p>別克著蘇聯外文出版局發行</p>
<p>世界上有特殊意義的事情，在歷史上總會佔有篇幅，作爲後人的一種驚惕或參考。所以歷史猶如一面鏡子，它能反映出過去的各種事情情。當我們回想到一九四一年十月，德寇使用「閃電戰術」，節節進迫蘇京，莫斯科危在旦夕；但因蘇軍的沉着抗戰，莫斯科保衛戰終於成爲勝利的轉捩點時侯，我們一定會疑惑這中間有什麼關鍵在。那末「恐懼與無畏」能吿訴你。這是一部以小說筆調來寫的戰事記錄，由當時保衛莫斯科的巴武爾章、莫爾什·烏雷營長口述，再由別克記下來。</p>
<p>它吿訴我們，當時德寇使用大量兵力來攻莫斯科，而蘇軍在數量上說來是差得遠。烏雷營長的使命就是以一營－七百個左右士兵，來保衛莫期科的大門的六公里的一段公路，使德軍不能長驅直入。因軍隊數量如此懸殊，所以烏雷營長不能不以智謀取勝；弄得他日夜思慮，推敲他預想的種種戰術。在戰爭中又使他知道「在戰爭中的論證並不像在邏輯學和數學中論證那樣。在戰爭中是以血來證明的」經騐。同時他心中總有種恐懼時常與理智交戰着，他拚命使理智克服害怕。因了戰事的進行，蘇軍的陣地被德軍突破了幾處，烏雷營長的一營戰士漸漸的被包圍了。以形勢言，他的一營軍隊很有被消滅的危險，但他沒有接到退的命令。他的內心又起了矛盾：如堅持下去，有被消滅可能。如撤退，沒有命令。當他想到「榮譽貴於生命」時，他的難題又解決了；同時他又想起他的上司潘菲洛夫師長的與他的談話，這談話亦鼓勵了並指導了他。使精神從新振作起來，用智謀與德寇堅持到底，非得到命令不撤退。爲激勵士氣，保貴士兵，他時時拿潘菲洛夫的「愛護士兵，不是用空話，而是用動作和火力愛護」的話警戒自已。</p>
<p>在冰天雪地中，德機轟炸下，德軍進攻中，烏雷營長用冷靜的頭腦應付一切。終於接到潘菲洛夫非撤退不可的命令，烏雷的一營士兵，在烏雷領導下「用動作和火力愛護」下，就安全的退出了危險區。因了他的牽制德軍，使德軍行動不便，使蘇軍在時間上佔了便宜，蘇軍的援兵便開到了，解了莫斯科的園，而成爲勝利的關鍵。</p>
<p>從這裏使我們知道指揮官對於戰事有何等重大的影響！無論對自己部下，對敵人。同時指揮官亦不是所謂「鐵打的人」，他亦有恐懼及矛盾，祗在乎他如何克服他內心的弱點。這或許就是勝利關鍵所在吧。</p>
<p>諸位讀者要知道得詳細一些，不妨買一本來看看，而譯筆的流利，內容的緊張，猶如一張戰事影片。</p>

<p>民主與設計的原著者利廉德氏是Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·（田納西河谷　管理局的節稱）的主席，本其十年經騐，把這個偉大事業，從問題的發生到解決的過程中，詳爲描述，非常熱情，非常忠實，他不隱諱已發生的種種障礙——如人民的懷疑，工業家的冷淡以及專家們的各執己見等等，終於靠他把握住民主的原則，加以克服了，最後蹄納到他的一個新的認識，就是：「要得到新工作，新工廠，肥沃的農田，並不必需選擇於左右兩極端之間，並不必需選擇於過分集權的龐大政府與無力政策之間，並不必需選擇於私人企業與社會主義之間，」著者更總結他的經騐說：「事情能作得有效的最好的方法，而且也許就是唯一的方法，就是遵守自然的一體，隨順民主的方法，由人民自己天天積極參加。」這是田窪局這個實行民主設計，科學與生活，工藝與人民結合的實騐成就的要義，也就是著者在本書所要拿具體實物來弄明白的，「在這一個谷窪裏，已證明能够發展出些方法（著者稱爲草根民主的方法）由此而爲更大的快活，更深的經騐，爲自由，創造機會，就在技術進步的路程中。」</p>
<p>根據全書二十章的敍述，我們可以知道Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·之所以能有今日的成功，決不是偶然的，而是有其成功的條件：</p>
<p>第一是靠政府——總統及國會的支持，絕對的信　，同時Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·對政府也絕對負起責任。</p>
<p>第二是靠科學家工程師及技術人員的通力合作，按照一定的計劃，艱苦奮鬥十年之久，而能擺脫了官僚政治與黨派鬥爭的牽制。</p>
<p>第三是靠目標的正確，始終爲人民謀利益，因此能得到人民的熱心參加。</p>
<p>十年之前的田納西河流域的情形是怎樣的呢？據著者自己所說：「河流成爲氾濫的威脅，土地和人民，煎熬於荒廢與乾旱的狀况中。」又說：「田納西河已往常常是一個破壞的爲害的怪物。」</p>
<p>十年以後的現在，又換了另一幅新的景象，著者說：「走到每處地方，你都可以看到這種改變。你可以君到沿路的電綫，新刷色的房屋，農村中新設的電力抽水機，路口上設置着的冷藏所，鋸木廠和研磨機你還能看見今天在那裏的工廠，那兒幾年以前是地方已盡了的農田，和櫛比排列着的茅屋，現在你看到市鎭邊際的新房舍無盧萬千。」又說：「新的私人工業在這裹建設起來了，從前倒閉了的企業復活了，人民手中的錢多起來了，稅務的弊端减少了，銀行存款增加了，市塲的購買力加强了。」</p>
<p>這個顯著的改變是如何達到的呢？開始是建築許多蓄水池，收容山上各處流下來的水，經過一個大的鋼管，使水力轉化爲電力，供給各工廠以及流域內居民之用，遇到暴雨的季節，管理局以無綫電指揮，開放各蓄水池的存水，來容納雨水，以免氾濫成災。因爲雨水的調節，使農田土壤不致被水冲刷，再由管理局免費供給憐酸肥料，以增加地力，農產自然增加了，家畜家禽的數目也增加了，蓄水池有水閘，使湍急的河流變爲平坦的河面，可以便利航運，再進而在谷窪中百分之五十四的地方，都種上樹，總共有一千四百萬畝的林地，再進而改善農村的道路房屋以及醫藥衛生文化敎育種種設備，於是新農村建設成功了。</p>
<p>在道偉大的全部工程上，充分表現了民主的精神，眞做到了爲人民所有，爲人民所治，爲人民所享的程度，因此Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·不僅是一個經濟的組織，同時也可以說是一個政治的組織，用另一種方式，達到了民主政治的任務，但地竭力避免捲人政黨政治的漩渦，運用人行政也都是超黨派的，在局裏工作的人員，不許參加政治活動。這樣，能使技術知識，專爲人們的日常生活而服務，爲人類改進的公共目標而服務，得到民主之現代的形式及其運用的收穫。</p>
<p>我爲了明瞭Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·的實際情形，又請敎了剛從美國考察歸來的王祖烈工程師，他在Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·實習了三個月之久，是專門研究水利工程的，據他說；</p>
<p>「Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·的組織，是以董事部爲最高指導機構，董事三人，一爲總統所派，一爲田納西州州政府所派，一爲田納西州州立大學所派，互推一人爲主席，負執行責任。</p>
<p>董事部之下設總經理，總經理爲實際負責人，下分三大部門，一管河流，一管電力，一管農田，各部之下再各設十餘科，工作人員甚多，即以測繪科一科而言，就有八百多人，工作人員生活非常安定，研究精神非常認眞。</p>
<p>管理局十年來的成績，已完成電力水利工程，現在祗須管理即可，現正在研究農田改進工作，故有肥田粉工廠之設置，ＴＶＡ現有二十四個壩，所發的電力，不謹供給田納西流域居民之用，而且在戰時供給軍用，製造原子彈之用。</p>
<p>該管理局成立於一九三三年，正當美國失業恐慌之時，目的在救濟失業及防洪，因該河流過去時常洪水爲災，土地貧瘠，平時雨量亦大，故蓄永庫之目的在防洪，不在灌溉。</p>
<p>田納西河流域雖包括七州，但尙不及淮河流域大，我國導淮委員會成立於民國二十年，較ＴＶＡ猶早，可惜我國人才經費兩缺，未能即見事功。」</p>
<p>現在國內又正鬧着設立ＴＶＡ揚子江流域管理局希望大家來研究ＹＶＡ成功的條件，看我們將來能否做到，依我看，還不僅是人才經費的問題，有了人才經費，還得問問有沒有脫離黨派漩渦專爲事業俊幹到底的精神。</p>

<h3>「同溫層」航行　「戰爭的貢獻」</h3>
<p>— 王一德</p>
<p>在離海面一萬五千公尺到二萬五千公尺之間，那裏的氣溫終年在攝氏表零下五十度左右；因爲溫度恒常不變，所以就稱那一帶的高空爲「同溫層」。</p>
<p>同溫曆航空在二次大戰之前，世人尙認爲冒險之舉，那時作同溫曆航空的人，僅限於少數的科學家和探險家而已。沒有普通的乘客敢作嘗試，也沒有作同溫層航行的旅客機。</p>
<p>大戰發生，參戰各國科學家們鈎心鬥角，對於飛機之改進不遺餘力。尤其是美國，因作戰的必需和避免敵方制空砲火的射擊起見，不得不將飛機飛行的高度超出一萬五千公尺以上。這樣一來，向被世人視爲神秘高空的同溫層，幾乎成爲飛將軍們每天必經之地了，所謂同溫層飛行亦不再使人有新奇之感覺。</p>
<p>但是，同溫曆飛行却非普通飛機所能勝任。因爲在同溫層中不但氣候寒冷，並且氣壓低小，　氧缺乏；普通飛機祗能上昇至六千公尺左右，若冒險達到同溫層，勢必險象園生：以駕駛者而言，則因氧之缺乏而感窒息，因氣壓低小而毛細血管脹裂耳鼻出血；以飛機本身而言，則高空因氣候酷寒，飛機之　面等易爲水氣堆樍而凝結成冰，若不斷飛行水氣加多冰結愈厚，結果飛機因不勝祖負而下墜：所以普通飛機不適合作同溫層飛行之用。</p>
<p>航行同溫層的飛機呌同溫層航空機，戰時美軍所用的B17型空中要塞和B29型超空要塞即屬此類。這種飛機是鑒於普通飛機不能作同溫層飛行而特別設計的；這種飛機的駕駛員都帶有氧氣面罩，以防空氣之不足；機件亦有特別的散溫構造，使引擎內的溫度能平均散放在機體和機翼上，使水氣不致凝結成冰，於是飛機便能泰然飛行於同溫層之間了。</p>
<p>旅客用的同溫層飛機，是戰後才出現的；它的構造與戰時同溫層飛機又不同，因爲呌旅客在飛行時套上面罩究竟是桎梏的事。於是就有人新設計在飛機內裝置氣室，調節氣壓與溫度使適合人體正常需要，一如地面。在美國已有大量這種旅客用的同溫層飛機由轟炸機改裝而成，稱之爲Stratocruiser，直譯爲「同溫曆巡艦」其機體之龐大可想而知了。</p>
<p>在同溫層中因空氣稀薄氣壓低小，飛行時可以少受抵抗力，所以在速率方面就可以加快。戰後有許多國家都在開闢同溫層航綫。我國也正向美方訂購新機，假使一旦運筆，那末我們就可以毫不費力地在幾小時內來回於重慶上海之間了。</p>

<h3>蘇州話</h3>
<p>— 聲申</p>
<p>蘇州人的言語，實在使人傷腦筋，裏面的含意奧妙無窮；而且有深有淺，因此往往使外鄕人聽之有山東人吃麥冬，一巧也不懂之感。</p>
<p>蘇白分土白，切口　縮脚韻三類：</p>
<p>土白以女子說起來最爲適合，尤其是書壇上之一般女說書更爲悅耳動聽，眞好像鶯聲燕語，假使唱開篇時的曲調，嬌媚歌聲，斯斯文文，聽來眞令人有特殊之感。俗語云；「情願與蘇州人相駡，而不願與寗波人談話」。</p>
<p>縮脚韻多數是把四個字一句的成語，省除了末一個字而成的語言。</p>
<p>像城隍老一爺」；康三姑一娘一；鷄毛撣「帚」；談宋茅一龐」；風吹冷一「打」很通行的縮脚韻；其他還有莫名其「土地堂一（挼：「　」的諾音「　」，且廟」和「土地堂」好像同一意思）。妙不可「醬油」「醬油」即「鹽」也所以與「言」字音相彷彿。）</p>
<p>切口一類便是含意最深之蘇白，只有兩蘇州人一起才能全用切口對答。不要說，外鄉人不能明瞭，沒有蘇州話條養的人，憑你如何聰敏，恐怕也不能猜透其中的意義。切口在從前原是一般文人雅士之土白，後來一變爲下流人之口頭語。好像「上有黃樑，下有海，中間還有小門檻」。（上面的句子是表示一女子在不如意時說：「我上面有公婆，下面有子女，而在中間還有丈夫」）。</p>
<p>一小洞中爬不出大　」。（這是表示一個人不肯出適當的銅錢，買不到好東西。</p>
<p>「上香頭」（普通所謂一上香頭」，是指師娘們說的鬼上身了，但切口中的上香頭；是表客人到來拜訪）。</p>
<p>「一粒芝頭能大」。（好比一件細小的事預備去做成。但是回想橫討厭，豎困難，倒反而弄得無從辦起了，）「　　箕相對，壞掃帚」（就是所謂與郞才女貌的意思相反。）</p>
<p>蘇州人的語言，照如此情形看來，確是複雜異常，使得聽者要煞費苦心。</p>

<h3>「刺花黨」</h3>
<p>— 黃接靑</p>
<p>我國在宋朝已有刺花，當時所募兵勇，都在手背上刺字，染以色素，終身不滅，作爲識別，並且藉以防止臨陣逃脫。</p>
<p>宋以後歷朝，對於重罪犯發配遠戍的，在面部刺以金字；輕罪的，在額上刺字，喚做「墨刑」。遜淸時代，凡是凶犯，搶匪，竊賊，逃兵均施行刺字。盜匪初犯，在右臂刺記，再犯刺左臂；逃兵初犯刺右面，再犯刺左面。每一罪名，刺地也異。</p>
<p>日本在二百數十年前，對於盜刦案犯，刑期屆滿，釋放以前，例須刺字，以防再犯時便於查緝，直到近代指紋學可以應用時，方不才取消墨刑。</p>
<p>至於全身刺花胸，臂背部，五色斑斕，世界各國民族，都有流行，便是所謂「文身」一半由於裝飾或留記念，一半作爲「勇敢」的表示。其實都不渦是野蠻行爲的殘留罷了。</p>
<p>當民國十四年，淞滬警察應曾下令捉拿「刺花黨」。因爲當時據說上海的流氓地痞，有秘密團體的組織，凡是黨員，臂部腿間都刺有花紋，作爲標認。因此一來，鬧得滿城風雨，本來「文身」的人以低級職業者居多，所以那時候，連到理髮匠，浴室擦背，船夫水手亦多不敢外出，因爲一經被捕，便要大費口舌。</p>
<p>歐美各國的水兵和從事海上失涯的人，大都在身體上刺有本人的姓名或符號，以作萬一道到不測，可供親友辨認識別。但也有刺繪奇怪的圖案花紋，和荒誕不經的字句。過去，曾有一個美國水兵，在胸前刺了華感頓和林肯兩偉人的肖像，頸下加刺「面惡心慈」的字句。又有一人，在胸部刺了一對印度人的結婚像。又有一人，左臂刺一啤酒瓶，右臂刺一水手調戲婦女圖一，胸前更刺有三個年輕貌美的西班牙少女像，可謂洋洋大觀。此外更有一個惡作劇的男子，在臍腹以下，刺了「婦女所愛的一一行字。有一女子，在臂上刺了幾位情人的簽名式。又有一女人在左臂刺有「利劍穿心圖」，並附刺「紀念親愛的勞萊先生」等字。此外，日本市井無頓的婦女，很多有混身刺繪五彩花紋圖案的。</p>

<h3>乞丐的化裝</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>每個成年的乞丐，不論男女，都得穿上一件百結的鶉衣，提着長棒，方可上街乞討。因爲這件鶉衣是乞丐的標轍，表示他們實在窮得太不成話，藉此引起施主惻隱之心。可是我們如果細心的觀察那件鶉衣，便不免要引起疑　起來。因爲一件衣服（鶉衣祇限於上身衣服）如果穿得又舊叉破，破到不能再穿的地步，事實上決不會破碎到那麼支離割裂的模樣。這自然又是丐流們苦心地採用人工的技術，加以補綴，併接，而且一條一縷地打成了結。要在鶉衣上找尋一塊兩方寸的完好的布塊，簡直就找不到。每個乞丐要造成這樣一件鶉衣，確曾費盡了時間與精神。名爲百結，事實上決不止打一百個結呢。而且表面不管如何破裂，內中却襯着夾裏。這夾裏雖然也是雜色布塊補襯着的，可是大體上却密不透風。在寒冷的季節，那鶉衣的裏面還可以穿上幾件並不太壞的舊衣裳呢。但路人那裏看得出。筆者幼時曾見一個老丐婦穿着一件類此的鶉衣。我的　母雲不過眼，便把一件舊棉襖送給了她，要她就穿在外面以禦寒氣。但那丐婦執拗地把它穿在鶉衣的裏面。據她說，如果好衣裳穿在外面，誰也不肯再給她錢了。鶉衣雖是破不成衣，但却縫有極牢固的大口袋一二只在內，藉以收藏錢鈔。</p>
<p>避狗秘訣</p>
<p>穿上百結鶉衣雖然有利於乞討，可是同時却招來了羣狗的騷擾。尤其是村鎭地方，每戶有狗，家狗野狗，終日尋事生非。一見鶉衣丐兒到來，於是「一犬吠影，衆犬吠聲。」如無避狗秘訣，這碗呌化飯也是喫不得的。丐帮中祖傳有各種避狗秘訣，而其唯一的利器乃是手裏一根長棒。但要運用裕如，也須經騐與訓練。乞丐深信「咬狗不吠，吠狗不咬」的道理。所以吠狗雖多，並不着急，却祇注視那兩頭不發吠的猛狗，等它們衝上來時，便將長棒望着狗嘴裏猛戳兩下。猛狗必受創奔逃。這時仰着　子助威的羣狗。看見它們的勇先鋒敗陣，也都四散奔逃了。</p>

<h3>閒話鄒魯</h3>
<p>— 疾風</p>
<p>年已六十五歲的中委鄒魯（海濱），近突以中風聞，正在中央醫院診治中。他秉性倔強，在黨國歷史足與胡漢民相埒。年靑時即幹練有爲，曾在香港和陳烱明辦一小報，名呌一可報一，攻擊政府，不留一些餘地。時國父與朱執信等正籌活動，鄒氏即在此時，加入同盟會，和胡展堂，鄧慕韓等朝夕相處，成爲莫逆。</p>
<p>民國後，當過應運使，財政廳長，後來又轉入教育界，先後任廣東高等師範及國立廣東大學校長。十四年第一屆中央執委林森，居正，覃振，和鄒等十餘人，在北平西山國父靈前開會，議決解屈鮑羅廷等議案，人遂目鄒爲西山會議派。</p>
<p>鄒氏在粵省有相當的地位，當二十五年日本正籌侵略中國時，松井大將曾特地到廣州往訪鄒魯，談論中日問題。當時鄒氏直捷了當地說：『老實對你說，中國人沒有一個不恨日本人，日本對付中國的手段有三個：對黃河以北用「搶一，長江流域用「嚇」，珠江流域用「騙」，不管其名詞用一親善」也好，「大亞洲主義」也好，「統一」也好。其侵略則一。』鄒氏口沒遮攔，不等松井多嚕囌，便叫着：『我根本不相信日本人，別談別談—』把松井送出天門。</p>
<p>鄒氏長中山大學有年，擅長文學，讀書甚多，普作散見於「民國」，「建設」，「正誼」，「新中華」等雜誌，其在民國以前所作之文，悉燬於光復時諮議局寓室的炸彈，現有「鄒魯文存」，「中國國民黨史稿」，「廣州三月二十九革命史」，「環遊二十九國記」諸書行世。</p>
<p>黨國要人中的佞佛者，除戴季陶以外，大概就是鄒魯了；在家中，鄒氏常和其佛人唸佛禮懺，並特建有佛堂·整潔異常。</p>
<p>鄒氏面相異人，齒特長，相者曾評他貌似象形，斷爲貴貌。但後來挪氏續弦。自覺齒長不雅觀，乃就牙醫生拔去，據說當時星相家曾爲之嘆息不置，認爲自己破壞了好命運云。</p>
<p>話且打住。記者謹在此希望鄒氏能早占勿藥！</p>

<h3>索橋的故事</h3>
<p>— 周圭</p>
<p>世界上的事物，往往因兩性的愛而產生奇蹟，這種情形，在中外歷史上，可以找到不少的例子。記得縫紉機的發明，也是因爲一個多情的丈夫，看到他的愛妻在手裏縫紉衣服，旣勞力而又浪費時間，所以千方百計，造成了縫紉機來代替手工，這是多麼値得艷羨的一件事呵！</p>
<p>四川成都附近灌縣都江堰的索橋，也包含一段動人的故事。去年秋天，我曾親歷其境，並承靑年旅行社的主人張君。吿訴了我這一段故事。于右任先生在他的記事詩中，曾將索橋名爲『夫婦橋』和『父子廟』相對，（李冰父子創建都江堰水利工程，後人紀念李氏功業，建『伏能觀」在都江堰之東。）傳爲美談。</p>
<p>據說在淸朝初年的時候，在都江堰地方，因爲水流的湍激，並未建築橋樑，只是有官渡的設立，人民過江都是免費通行的。在離南岸不多遠的地方，住着一位秀才名字呌做何先德。他在家中設了一所村熟，敎幾個小學生。每到斜陽欲墜的時候，因爲村中沒有酒店，他便騎了一匹騾子，到江邊去坐了官渡的船，過江去喝一盅「乾酒」（四川酒名如高梁酒）。因爲他有驟子同時過江，並且是一個堂堂的秀才，所以船夫就每次要討一文制錢爲酬報，讓他獨乘一船過江。道樣子過了幾年，不幸遇到了年成歉收，這位何秀才的經濟受了打擊，但是他習以爲常的過江去喝酒，並不是因財力打了折扣而放棄他的嗜好。過江去固然爲了飲酒，但還可以和幾位老朋友擺擺龍門陣，（四川話即談天）這也是當時社交中心，可以解解一天的塾中沈悶。可是每天來回耗費二文制錢的旅費，在當時已着實可觀。因在那時一個人上酒店大嚼一頓也，不過三四文制錢。隨着經濟收入的减少，這等支出，在何秀才更覺得嚴重起來。他一想，這是官渡，別人都不出錢，爲怎麼單要我出錢，這個船夫眞在敲詐了。</p>
<p>於是，他便向縣衙門去控吿這船夫。船夫聽見了這位何秀才在控吿他敲詐勒索，他急得不得了。於是跑到一位惡訟師那邊去求救。那位惡訟師就給他擬就了辯訴書，說「都江堰本是官渡，人們過江，從來不取渡資，但何秀才之情形不同，他過江是單放的（即獨乘一舟），並且帶了一匹騾子。騾子的脚上釘了鐵的，上船下船，船板容易損壞。小人是以每次收費一文，以作修理船板之用。至於何秀才本人，與其他旅客一樣是免費的，請求大人鑒宥。」到了開審的時候，縣官聽了雙方的起訴和申辯，覺得這個船夫並沒有過失。於是批下來何秀才敗訴了。</p>
<p>何先德對於這個打擊，他心上如何能過得去呢？就是他的許多朋友，也是很抱不平。眞的一個秀才和一側目不識丁的船夫講理都講不過麼？明知道有一個惡訟師在作祟，但事已如此，無可奈何了。可是，他們總想在都江堰造一座橋，這樣才可以不受這船夫的氣，</p>
<p>時節已是初冬了。北風吹在將枯的樹葉上呼呼作聲，有時還一片片臨空飄落下來。何秀才的太太，和共他村婦一樣能幹勤儉。一家大小的鞋子，都是她自己做的。她常常把長櫈翻轉放在地上。四脚朝天，把做鞋底的綫，一匝一匝地繞在上面。一天，何秀才正坐在旁邊抽烟解悶，看他的太太繞鞋綫。忽然一片黃葉落到這一匝匝的綫上停住了，不跌下來。他就很高興地對他的太太說「你且停住，你看，這黃葉能够逗留在這錢上，假使吾們根據這個原理，用許多竹索，（以竹劈成細綫，編成繩子，細者作拉縴，盛行於湖南四川等地。）在沙帶上做了橋墩，把牠南岸經到北岸，上面舖了橫木板，這樣不就是一條可以走人的橋嗎？這橋的成功，一定把胸中的積恨舒洩了。」他的太太也成贊成了這個計劃，因爲經費等待籌措，他們又吿訴了許多同學和朋友，大家都表示贊成的，並且給他很大的帮忙；於是籌款，購料，招工，造成了這條都江堰的「索橋」。何秀才和他的太太以及同情他們的親友們，都非常高興。而官渡的船夫，只能另改行業了。</p>
<p>但是美中不足的，道位「能知天下事」的秀才先生，對於邊橋，本是門外漢，那裏會考慮週到呢？這條橋只有橋身而兩邊沒有欄杆的，加以有一華里之長。又是在北臨高山的江面上。冬天的北風，眞是移沙走石地吹着。下面的江流又是汹湧得很。這動盪的長索橋，眞是危險！</p>
<p>造好了不多天，有一天早上，因爲村人趕集市，過橋的人太擁擠了，結果把橋翻了轉來。在道寒風凜烈的天氣，人跌在江水衷，很少有不死之理，於是乎何秀才的命運，又跌入愁雲慘霧裏了。</p>
<p>這慘案發生以後，官渡的船夫，就去和那位惡訟師商量如何能維持他渡船的生活。得到惡訟師的指示，他便到縣衙門去控吿何秀才，建造形同兒戲的索橋以致人於死命。於是何秀才百口難辯，終於被拘入獄，其餘他的親友們，也都消聲匿跡，惟恐累及自己，而何先德悶　氣憤，不久竟病死於獄中。船夫又恢復了他的官渡。</p>
<p>這索橋的案子，在旁人心目中，自從何秀才死後，都在漸漸地淡下去。可是他的太太心坎中的創傷，無時無刻不在隱痛。這口氣不出，如何對得起他的丈夫呢？何秀才死後，他還有一個小兒子在搖籃裏做着甜蜜的夢。一天他的寡母，坐在他的搖籃旁邊做針線。一隻脚踏在搖籃底下的弧形木條上推盪。她又想起了索橋翻身的事情。她發覺搖籃之所以波盪而小孩不會翻倒出來，因爲兩邊有欄杆，假使索橋也兩邊做了欄杆，也可以不翻身了。於是她就去和她丈夫的親友商量，結果大家一致贊同，这成爲世界奇蹟的原始而又科學化的索橋，何先德雖以身殉而未竟全功，但他的賢慧的夫人，却完成了這不朽的工作。</p>
<p>你要走了！這是你已下了的決心。在這樣寒冷的冬夜裏，你的走顯然更增加了我的凄楚。</p>
<p>你說：「我走了，我是難過的，自然也更使你難過！」</p>
<p>你說後，我們彼此默然相對，臉上的表情，保持着那般的呆板，連極微小的隨便的動作也沒有，深怕會有什麼不測的事情發生，或者怕被別人瞧見我們的不安。其實我道間卑陋的臥室，就是白天也像與別人隔離開了，何况在這夜裏呢；在道樣的地方，絕不會有人來窺視我們。可是我們仍是那般遲純的平息着，竭力地去抑制各人內心的情感，不讓它發洩出來再作一度熟烈的溶匯。</p>
<p>你是慣於能隨時克制强烈情感暴露的人，端坐着一動也不動，睜大眼睛，瞪着暗澹的屋角。而我呢？斜對着你望着你。突然，我想要去抓住你的手，伏下頭來放縱地哭一會，因爲我是已無法再忍受這窒息的空氣了。這是比承受暴君所施的任何一種有形的刑罰更痛苦的呵！同時我想最後用眼淚去過止你的出走，可是我沒有照樣做，這樣的行爲，表現在你的眼前，是太可憐稚氣的。</p>
<p>燈光幽暗，外面的寒風狂嘨，玻璃窗被吹打得砰隆砰隆的響。我聽見你的心卜卜地跳動，你彷彿在蹂着脚，似要掙脫什麼地跳起來。</p>
<p>「抽烟吧！」你從衣袋裏掬出了一包香烟。</p>
<p>我們點了火抽起烟來，白迷迷的烟圈，從你的嘴角噴出；白烟繚繞，我們的險都糊糢了。稀淡的影子，充塞屋內，好像無敷欷歔的嘆息。滿佈我們的週圍，烟解救了我們默對的苦惱。</p>
<p>我想起了酒——從前你來時，我們常在深夜同喝的。我起來，跑到門邊的櫃子前面，打開那扇小門，拿起五茄皮的酒瓶，但是裏而是空的，我扔下瓶子，走到窗邊，倚着窗外望向外面，我不對你說一句話，你似乎在接抽第二枝香烟了。</p>
<p>外而通向大街的小巷，那盞孤零的路燈，像啜泣過後的眼睛，露出憊倦的瞳孔，只有一綫黃色的影子，塗在黑越越的牆壁上。</p>
<p>我想着；自明天起，這條小巷就只剩下我孤獨的足音了。以前你是常來這裏的，雖然道汚穢的陋巷，從來就少行人，但有時淸早或晚上的時刻，仍饗着我們同進出的兩雙調和拍子的足音。你走後，這小巷會像一隻寒冷可怕的手，伸向我的身邊了！</p>
<p>我繼續想下去，你仍默然坐在那邊。</p>
<p>寒夜的時間，我們便是這樣的挨過了很久。因爲要趕上夜車，你不能再留下了，我替你提起你帶來簡單的行李，送你走出小巷到大街呌了三輪車。你上了車子，刺骨的寒風正猛刮而來，我們互握着的手，像兩塊冰凍的枯木，沒有一點溫暖的交流。是你先放了我的手，催車夫拉車走了。</p>
<p>我望着你的車子，一直等待到拐過大街的轉角。你沒有作一次回顧。我慢慢的走回小巷，瑟縮着身體躱，避察風。我知道這次離別，在情感上你是難過的，然而，你咀咒這惡濁靡爛的地方，你要堅決的離開這裏，走上另一條新的大路，我明白你堅強的意志不會後悔，也用不着後悔的。</p>
<p>當然踏進冷淸的門口時，我記起了你曾對我說過的話：「像這樣腐朽的地方，難道還値得留戀嗎？」</p>

<p>葉，飄然的辭別了樹，聚集在根旁的泥土上，維護着根，讓冰雪腐化了它，再給樹以滋養，爲了明年的花和果！和那些向春天，向陽光吐露的新葉！</p>

<h3>Marshall Appointed U.S. Secretary of State; Left Beijing Yesterday Morning and Arrived in Guam; Chairman and Madam Chiang Personally Saw Him Off at the Airport</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] U.S. President Truman's Special Envoy to China, Marshal George C. Marshall, carrying a personal letter from Chairman Chiang to the U.S. President, departed Beijing at 8:15 AM on the 8th aboard a C-54 Skymaster for his return to the United States. He was accompanied by his personal aide, Colonel K. C. Koier, and others. Chairman and Madam Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan T.V. Soong, Minister Wang Shih-chieh, Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng, Minister Yu Ta-wei, Military Counselor Pi Tsung-kan, Secretary-General Huang Jen-lin, CCP representatives Wang Ping-nan and Chang Wen-chin, U.S. Ambassador John Leighton Stuart, U.S. Counselor Walter S. Robertson, Information Officer Connors, and about thirty other Chinese and foreign journalists saw him off at the large airport. The atmosphere at the airport today was filled with poignant farewells. Minister Wang Shih-chieh arrived at the airport as early as 7:30 AM. President Soong T.V., Chief of General Staff Chen, Ambassador Stuart, and Yu Ta-wei also arrived in succession. They paced around the tarmac, silent and pensive. At 7:50 AM, Marshal Marshall arrived in a five-star car, wearing a light yellow military coat, five-star epaulets, and a military cap. At this moment of parting, his face also showed signs of reluctance. As soon as he got out of the car, he was surrounded by the well-wishers at the airport, shaking hands with each of them. He also had a long conversation with President Soong, Minister Wang, Chief of General Staff Chen, and Ambassador Stuart in a corner of the airport. After the conversation, he cordially shook hands with the staff of the nearby airport terminal. Marshal Marshall also bid farewell to Lao Chang, the Chinese driver who drove his five-star car. Shortly after, Chairman and Madam Chiang arrived at the airport. Marshal Marshall immediately stepped forward, took off his hat, and shook hands with them. Chairman Chiang wished Marshal Marshall a safe journey, which was translated by Military Counselor Pi Tsung-kan. After talking for about five minutes, Marshal Marshall boarded the plane. Chairman Chiang also boarded the plane to bid farewell to his old friend and personally handed him a letter to be delivered to President Truman. Chairman Chiang left the plane after about three minutes, while Marshal Marshall stood by the door to see him off. At 8:15 AM, the propellers started turning, and the special envoy for peace, who had been in China for thirteen months, took off and flew towards the northeast.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Less than half an hour after Marshal Marshall left Beijing, it was learned here that Washington had announced his appointment as Secretary of State to succeed James F. Byrnes. All parties were extremely pleased that a friend familiar with the Chinese situation was appointed to this position.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, United Press] Secretary of State James F. Byrnes has resigned, effective January 10th. President Truman has announced the appointment of General George C. Marshall as his successor. [Caption: On the right is Byrnes, on the left is Marshall]</p>
<p>[United Press, Guam, 8th] Special Envoy Marshall arrived here today aboard a special plane en route to Washington. He made a brief stopover and appeared to be in good spirits. However, he remained silent about the policy direction he would take after assuming the post of Secretary of State. When asked whether he would follow the general policies of his predecessor, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, Marshal Marshall smiled and said, "It would be foolish to answer such a question at this time." Marshal Marshall heard the news of his new appointment via the plane's radio. However, he stated, "I had discussed this matter with the President and knew that an announcement was forthcoming."</p>
<p>Byrnes' Sudden Resignation Shakes Washington's Diplomatic Circles</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] The resignation of Secretary of State James F. Byrnes has been regarded by diplomatic, political, and congressional circles here as a bombshell. Members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives expressed regret over Byrnes' departure but also expressed dissatisfaction with the President's appointment of Marshall as his successor. It is generally expected that Congress will approve the appointment. Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg was the first to express regret over the resignation of the exceptionally talented Byrnes, considering it a great loss. At the same time, he welcomed Marshall, who is trusted by Congress, and wished him success. Former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Tom Connally, also praised Byrnes highly. Some observers also noted that Marshall has a high chance of becoming President, because according to the Constitution, if President Truman were to leave office for any reason, the Vice President would succeed him. Currently, there is no Vice President (Truman himself rose from Vice President to President), so the Secretary of State would be the next in line.</p>
<h3>Marshall's China Policy Unchanged After Taking Office; Minister Peng States in Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Marshal Marshall's statement has attracted great attention from all sides. Minister Peng stated at a press conference on the afternoon of the 8th, "Marshal Marshall made this statement in a sincere and friendly spirit, and I read it in the same spirit. He also said that Marshal Marshall had discussed many of the points with him. When reporters asked when Marshal Marshall had discussed them with him, Peng replied, "He has discussed them several times," but did not specify the dates. Peng expressed pleasure at Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State and denied that Marshall's return to the United States would lead to a worsening of the conflict with the Communists. He stated, "We admire Marshal Marshall's efforts in China over the past year and acknowledge President Truman's description of Marshal Marshall's various achievements. Marshal Marshall's promotion to U.S. Secretary of State shows that the U.S. and we share the same views. As for the question of whether Marshal Marshall's return to the United States will lead to a worsening of the CCP's situation, I do not understand how the two are related. The Chinese government's policy will not change because of Marshal Marshall's promotion to Secretary of State. Regarding the progress of the government reorganization and discussions with various parties, Peng said that the government is working hard to implement the reorganization and that progress is good, but there is no concrete news to announce.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Stuart Declares: Denies Retirement</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Ambassador Stuart stated on the 8th that he has no intention of retiring and that rumors that he will submit his resignation after Marshal Marshall returns to the United States are inaccurate. The Communist Party Maintains Silence.</p>
<h3>Wang Shih-chieh Expresses Gratification</h3>
<p>The Communist Party Maintains Silence</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Wang Shih-chieh expressed gratification upon hearing of Marshal Marshall's new post as U.S. Secretary of State.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Communist Party spokesman Mei Yi remained silent on the matter of Marshal Marshall's appointment as U.S. Secretary of State and his statement, expressing no opinion. Marshall Will Make Greater Contributions.</p>
<h3>U.S. China Policy</h3>
<p>Marshall Will Make Greater Contributions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, United Press] Marshall will be better able to guide U.S. policy toward China in the future. Well-informed sources believe that he has been making continuous efforts to achieve this goal and that he may be able to work on a broader plan through remote control than when he was in China.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Jokes: Leaving Office is a Joyful Event</h3>
<p>Will Return to Hometown for Recuperation</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] When asked about his feelings about resigning at a White House banquet last night, Byrnes quipped, "A politician has two happy days in his life: the first is the day he is elected, and the second is the day he retires." Byrnes continued, stating that he plans to take a long vacation in his hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina.</p>
<h3>Lei Chen Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chang Chih-chung's Trip to Nanjing is for Reporting on Duties</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Minister Peng stated at a press conference on the afternoon of the 8th that Chang Chih-chung's trip to Nanjing was purely for reporting on his duties and that there have been no recent changes in the situation in Xinjiang Province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Since arriving in Shanghai on the evening of the 4th, Lei Chen has been in contact with people from various parties every day, conveying the government's sincerity in hoping that people from various parties will participate and complete constitutional preparations as soon as possible, and in its determination to resume peace talks. He also inquired about the opinions of various parties. It is now learned that Lei has completed his mission and returned to Nanjing by military plane at 10:00 PM last night (the 8th) to report the results of this trip to the government. Unless there is a special need, Lei will no longer come to Shanghai. The work of contacting various parties will continue to be handled by Chang Chün.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Luo Long-chi met with Lei Chen on the 6th to exchange views on the current situation. Luo strongly argued against the feasibility of reorganizing the government, believing that this move would close the door to negotiations. He jokingly used the example of hosting a banquet: the good dishes have been eaten, and the host wants to serve leftovers to the guests, making them nominally present. Even foolish guests would not participate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Situation; The Government is Paying Close Attention; Minister Peng Says It is Constantly Improving</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Minister Peng declared on the afternoon of the 8th that Shanghai is the nerve center of the country's economic life and that the government is paying special attention to the industrial and commercial situation there. Peng made this statement in response to a reporter's question about "what countermeasures the government is taking against the banking and industrial crisis." It is said that the government believes that there will be no major turmoil in the industrial and commercial sectors. President Roosevelt said that the most fearful thing is fear. Our country has suffered tremendous damage during and after the war, and there are difficult economic reconstruction problems. There are few shortcuts other than long-term efforts and hard work and thrift. Before major problems are solved, the government must maintain the existing agricultural, industrial, commercial, and transportation industries and constantly improve them. Every day, we must fight against rumor-mongers, speculators, and hoarders. New problems arise every day and must be properly resolved, and the advantages and disadvantages must be weighed to make decisive and forceful decisions. Many measures have been taken in the past, and we must continue to work tirelessly in the future.</p>
<h3>All Members of the Shanghai Municipal Assembly Are Grateful for Marshal Marshall's Hard Work; Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu Issue a Joint Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Marshal George C. Marshall was summoned to return to the United States from China the day before yesterday and was honorably appointed as U.S. Secretary of State. All circles in this city have expressed regret at Marshal Marshall's departure. A reporter specifically inquired about the feelings of several local leaders. According to Speaker Pan Kung-chan and Deputy Speaker Hsu Chi-ch'ing, they jointly told reporters: "Marshal George C. Marshall was sent to China by President Truman at the end of the year before last. Except for a return to the United States last March to report on his duties, his efforts for China's peaceful reunification lasted for a year, and his hard work and painstaking efforts were witnessed by all of us. Although Marshal Marshall's efforts to promote peace talks were obstructed and sabotaged by extremists and have not yet been fully successful, the Political Consultative Conference had already passed the 'Program for Peaceful National Reconstruction,' and the government and the Communist Party had agreed to and signed the plan for the reorganization and integration of the army. Moreover, the convocation of the National Assembly and the drafting of the democratic constitution were completed by the government at the end of last year, following the principles of the Political Consultative Conference, and were announced on New Year's Day this year. All this, China is moving towards the great road of democratic constitutionalism and peaceful reunification. We are all happy to see the correctness of the policies adopted by the government, but we also know that this is all the result of Marshal Marshall's patience and efforts in China over the past year. Marshal Marshall has been summoned back to the United States this time to assume a new mission, which is important. He left in a hurry and was unable to pass through Shanghai. We were unable to shake hands with him to say goodbye, which is very regrettable. All members of the Municipal Assembly must be grateful for Marshal Marshall's hard work during his stay in China and are especially confident that his assumption of responsibility for the diplomacy of the Allied countries will further contribute to the strengthening of Sino-American relations and the maintenance of world peace. We respectfully express this sentiment to wish Marshal Marshall a healthy journey and success in his mission."</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to people close to diplomatic circles, Marshal Marshall's departure can be said to be a good phenomenon for both the current domestic situation and future U.S. policy towards China. At a time when reactionary elements are fiercely anti-American, Marshal Marshall's return to the United States may also reduce the severity of the anti-American movement.</p>
<p>Feng Yu-chih, a representative of the Central Propaganda Department stationed in Shanghai, expressed the following thoughts: "Marshal Marshall has worked for China's peaceful reunification for more than a year, and his spirit and contributions are truly appreciated by us. It may be a fact that the United States hopes for peace in China, which is also beneficial to them, but the U.S. government and people certainly do not want to see their friendly country fall into a state of pain and unrest. Although Marshal Marshall's return to the United States will not interrupt the peace talks between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it may cause more difficulties due to the lack of an intermediary. Marshal Marshall's purpose in running around was to help promote China's peaceful reunification and achieve a truly democratic country. We can only hope to quickly fulfill his wishes for China to thank Marshal Marshall for his sincerity and hard work over the past year."</p>
<h3>The U.S. Note on the Dalian Issue; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Studying the Reply; China and India are Preparing to Exchange Envoys</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At the Central Propaganda Department's press conference on the 8th, a reporter asked, "It is reported that the Chinese government has requested the recovery of the Xisha Islands, and it is also reported that the Chinese flag has been flown over the Xisha Islands. What is the truth?"</p>
<p>Yeh Kung-chao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied: "The Chinese government has recovered the Xisha Islands from Japanese occupation. Sovereignty over these islands belongs to China, so there is no procedure to 'request a recovery' from any party."</p>
<p>Asked, "What is the Chinese government's attitude towards the note from the U.S. government regarding Dalian? Also, what procedures will the Chinese government take to take over Dalian?" Yeh replied, "The Chinese government has received the U.S. government's note regarding Dalian. Its content is generally the same as that reported in the newspaper. Regarding the legal status of Dalian, I have expressed my opinion previously and have nothing to add today." Asked, "The Chinese and Indian governments have agreed to upgrade their offices to embassies. Will the Chinese and Indian governments discuss the establishment of consulates?"</p>
<p>Yeh replied, "The Chinese and Indian governments agreed on October 22nd of last year to upgrade each other's commissioner's offices to embassies. Currently, both governments are preparing to send envoys. Our country has already established consulates in India, while the Indian government recently preliminarily established a consulate in Shanghai."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 8th] Yeh Kung-chao declared: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the reply to the U.S. note on the Dalian issue. There are currently no changes in the situation in Dalian." London Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Said</p>
<h3>Britain Hopes for the Opening of Dalian</h3>
<p>London Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Said</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman declared today: "Regarding the Dalian issue, although Britain has not followed the United States in issuing a note to the Soviet Union requesting the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, it very much hopes that the port can be fully opened and become a true free port for world trade." Britain did not have any contact with the U.S. State Department when it issued the note to the Soviet government.</p>
<h3>The Democratic League Decides to Establish a Political Planning Committee</h3>

<h3>Full Text of Marshal Marshall's Statement on Leaving China</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 7th] General George C. Marshall, President Truman's Special Envoy to China, today made a frank report to the American people, stating: "The greatest obstacle to peace in China is the mutual suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party." General Marshall, who was immediately summoned back to the United States by the President to report on the situation in China, continued: "Efforts to achieve reconciliation in good faith have been repeatedly obstructed by extremists on both sides." He said that in his view, the way to "save the situation" lies in the group of liberal elements from all parties working under Chairman Chiang's leadership taking practical steps to implement China's recently adopted democratic constitution.</p>
<p>According to the State Department, Marshal Marshall's message to the American people, who are deeply concerned about developments in the Far East, reads as follows:</p>
<p>"The President recently issued a comprehensive report on all developments in China over the past year, as well as the U.S. government's position on China. The current environment requires me to supplement this with my initial impressions.</p>
<p>During my negotiations to promote peace and a democratic government in China, there were several issues that I considered more important. In this complex and chaotic situation, I will only address those more important issues.</p>
<p>First, the greatest obstacle to peace is the mutual suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the government leaders are firmly opposed to organizing a communist government. On the other hand, the Communists frankly stated that they are Marxists and, although they will first go through a government based on the Anglo-American type of democracy, they still seek to establish a communist government in China.</p>
<p>The government leaders believe that the CCP's willingness to participate in the government stipulated by the Political Consultative Conference in January of last year is purely for destructive purposes. I believe that CCP members deeply feel that the government has no sincerity in implementing the PCC resolutions to form a new government. CCP members also believe that the government intends to eliminate the Communist Party through the threat of military force and the actions of the secret police. In addition to this strong mutual distrust, there is also an obvious mistake on both sides, namely, ignoring the impact of this fear on the other party's consideration of certain suggestions or reasons for opposition in negotiations. Both sides are trying to eliminate their own fears. Therefore, both sides are prejudiced against the other party's position and are wary of every suggestion or possibility. The chaotic news from the remote and vast military conflict front lines has further deepened this error. Skirmishes are often deliberately distorted as large-scale offensives. Both sides use distortions to slander the other. I can only rely on the reports of American officers in the Executive Headquarters teams to get a glimpse of the truth, and there are so many incidents in such a vast area that American personnel feel overwhelmed. I would like to mention the outstanding courage and bravery of the U.S. military and Marines in overcoming great obstacles to strive for peace in China.</p>
<p>I believe that the most important factors in the recent breakdown of negotiations are as follows: The most powerful group in the National Government (in fact, the Kuomintang) opposed almost all my efforts to promote a true coalition government. This opposition is often disguised as political or party actions, but the Kuomintang is the government, so its actions, although not direct, are very powerful. They openly and frankly declared that the cooperation of the CCP is unimaginable and that only a military policy can solve the problem. This group includes both military and political leaders.</p>
<p>On the CCP side, I believe there are radical elements and also liberal elements, but many people strongly oppose this view, believing that the CCP's party discipline is strict and that such different views are not allowed within a party. But in my opinion, there is indeed a group of liberal elements within the Communist Party, especially among the youth. They lean towards the Communist Party because they hate the corruption of the local government, but they value the interests of the Chinese people even more than the reckless measures to immediately establish a communist government. As for the truly extreme communists, they will not hesitate to use any radical means to achieve their goals, such as destroying transportation in order to destroy China's economy and create a situation conducive to overthrowing the government, regardless of the direct suffering of the people. They completely distrust the leaders of the Kuomintang. They seem to believe that every proposal made by the government is used to defeat the Communist Party. The crowd riots in February and March of last year, which were clearly instigated (some of which occurred only a few houses away from where I was negotiating), gave the Communist Party a good excuse to make their suspicions reasonable.

<h3>Detailed Measures for Sentence Reduction; May Be Announced in the Short Term</h3>
<p>Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Questions Yesterday</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] At the Central Propaganda Department's reception, a reporter asked, "Are there any political prisoners detained in China? If so, what impact will the recently announced amnesty have on them?" Minister Peng replied, "The Minister of Justice stated this morning that the amnesty decree is divided into two parts: (1) amnesty and (2) sentence reduction. The amnesty part has been effective since the date of publication in the National Government Gazette, and courts at all levels can handle it independently according to the law. The sentence reduction part is more complicated, and the detailed implementation measures are being drafted by the Judicial Yuan in conjunction with the Executive Yuan and will be announced and implemented in the short term. There are no purely political prisoners detained in the government-controlled areas. No one is detained for political beliefs, but no one who has committed a crime will be exempted simply because of their political affiliation."</p>

<h3>Intensified Efforts to Block the Huayuankou Breach: Expected Completion by End of Month; Communist Announcement to Build Dam Downstream to Block Water</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th] The Huayuankou breach blocking project is currently being intensified with the dumping of rocks. The water surface is already less than three meters. If the diversion of the river water is smooth, it can be completed as scheduled by the end of this month. The current flow of the old course of the Yellow River is forty cubic meters per second, one-thirtieth of the total flow, with a depth of seven Chinese inches, a width of thirty meters, and a speed of one Chinese li per hour. The water is gradually becoming turbulent. It can reach the vicinity of Lanfeng on the 8th. However, the Chinese Communists, using issues such as the relocation of residents along the riverbed as an excuse, have repeatedly expressed opposition to the blocking. Recently, they have repeatedly raised protests. Zhao Mingfu, the Chinese Communist representative stationed in Bian, has protested to the blocking and restoration engineering bureau and has also gone to Beijing to discuss the matter with Dong Biwu and others, the Chinese Communist representative stationed in Beijing. Various circles in Henan were extremely indignant upon hearing that the Chinese Communists were obstructing the blocking and restoration project. They all believed that the Yellow River flooding had caused a great catastrophe for the people of Henan. If they have even a little humanity, they should not obstruct the blocking and restoration project to save millions of refugees in the flood-stricken areas.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th] The Huayuankou breach blocking project is expected to be closed before the flood season. The news has been met with rejoicing by the people in the flood-stricken areas. However, the "JiluYu Administrative Office" of the Chinese Communists recently issued an announcement stating that it will build a dam downstream to block the flow of water. If the Chinese Communists implement this plan, the north and south banks of the Yellow River could face danger at any time.</p>
<h3>Dong Biwu Arrives in Shanghai: Meeting on Yellow River Issue to be Convened in Shanghai Within Days</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Yellow River issue, which has plagued our country for thousands of years, has recently caused disputes between the government and the Chinese Communists due to the measures taken for the Zhu Kou and levee restoration work. Chinese Communist representative Dong Biwu has arrived in Shanghai by early train yesterday at the invitation of General Egerton, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's China Office, to discuss the matter with relevant parties. At the same time, Yellow River Chief Engineer Tadd will also come to Shanghai from Kaifeng within days to participate in the Yellow River issue meeting. Director Huo Baoshu of the Executive Yuan has gone to Beijing last night to seek instructions. Once Huo returns to Shanghai, the meeting can be convened. Participants will include Director Zheng, General Egerton, Dong Biwu, Engineer Tadd, and representatives of the Water Conservancy Commission. According to Wu Yunfu of the Chinese Communist Party, Dong's biggest demands are three: (1) Postpone the blocking to avoid major flooding in Shandong; (2) Complete the levee restoration work as soon as possible to ensure that the old river course does not flood; (3) Immediately allocate 15 billion to subsidize the people who need to be relocated. According to our government, in order to save more than one million victims in the three provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, and Jiangsu and restore a large area of ​​fertile farmland, it has carried out the first step of the original plan, engaging in the Zhu Kou and levee restoration work, while the Chinese Communist Party insists that the Huayuankou Zhu Kou work must be delayed for another five months before it can be implemented. Wu said: After the water is released on December 27, it is expected that the flood will reach Jinan on the 15th of this month, and there will be a major flood in Shandong in late January and early February. It is urgent to seek a solution. The government has approved 66 billion for levee restoration expenses (6 billion has been allocated) and 15 billion for relief expenses (it has agreed to allocate two-thirds first). The total length of the Yellow River on both sides is 1900 kilometers, and the construction work is extremely difficult, and there are many problems. It will be after the representatives meet in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Wu, according to the reporter of this newspaper: The number of residents in the old course area who should be transferred reaches 350,777, of which 263,083 need to be rescued.</p>

<h3>Spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense Talks: No War Near Dalian; Landing of National Army on Dachangshan Island is Groundless</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] When answering questions from reporters from this agency today, the military spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense said: There has been much speculation about the military situation near Dalian, and the press has been spreading false information. The Shanghai Wenhui Bao reprinted a telegram from the Associated Press in Beiping on the 5th, stating that the National Army launched its first landing battle in Northeast China and captured Dachangshan Island and Haiyang Island, sixty miles northeast of Dalian, etc. According to investigations, the National Army north of Dalian is north of Pulandian and has not advanced. The National Army in the eastern area is west of Zhuanghe and has not come into contact with the Communist Army. As for the area of governing the sea, only a small number of coastal defense ships are patrolling and maintaining order. There is no landing on Dachangshan Island and Haiyang Island. I hope Gujie is not deceived by rumors.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch, Shenyang, 8th] Reporters have been inspecting the periphery of Dalian for several days. Some chimneys of the Anshan Steel Plant have been smoking.

<h3>Full Text of the Malaysian Ambassador's Statement on Leaving China: Continued from Page 1</h3>
<p>The most literate and inflammatory stage in the Communist program is the propaganda text. I would like to tell the American people: This food propaganda is completely devoid of truth and facts, and it deliberately misinterprets and destroys the policies and will of our government. All kinds of facts are sufficient to prove that the main goal of this propaganda is to deceive the people of China and the world and to arouse their hatred of the United States. It is difficult for us to remain silent about this act of public slander and disregard for the facts. However, after one denial, it is necessary to deny it every day, which is a kind of work that American members can hardly tolerate. Speaking fairly, although the news publishing institutions of the National Government do not have the county nature of Communist Party propaganda, there are also many erroneous reports. The statement issued by the Chinese Communist Party regarding the Anping incident is especially pure fabrication. As a result of the Anping incident, three Marine Corps soldiers were killed and twelve were injured. This incident was the result of a planned ambush and interception. The victims were several Marine Corps transport units transporting supplies and some general materials to the Executive Headquarters. The report from the Chinese Communist Party said that the incident was caused by the defensive attack by the Marine Corps. The investigation into this incident was also a story of procrastination in order to cover up the truth of this incident and privately acknowledge the facts.</p>
<p>Extremists on both sides have repeatedly frustrated sincere efforts to reach a solution. The agreement reached at the Political Consultative Conference a year ago was a free and grand charter, and this charter laid the foundation for China's peace and revival. However, the uncompromising people in the Kuomintang wanted to maintain their own feudal control over China, and they obviously had no sincerity in adhering to the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. Although I am speaking out as a soldier, I regret that I have opened up to the military's dominance. The military support has made the strength of the Chinese government increasingly weak. At the same time, people with similar sentiments in Xiangzhai must firmly remember: it is not the work of a small number of Communist Party groups or committees (this kind of work is also commonplace for us in the United States), but the movements of tens of thousands of people and more than 1 million soldiers.</p>
<p>I have never been able to determine the evolution of the Communist Party's internal attitude. The road followed by the Chinese Communist Party in recent months shows that they are unwilling to promote a fair compromise, which is the most certain thing. It is also impossible to promote talks between representatives of the Chinese Communist Party and the government. The Chinese Communist Party has now put forward its final demands, which have led to the breakdown of negotiations. They specifically demanded the dissolution of the National Assembly and the restoration of the military status on January 13, which were unacceptable to the government.</p>
<p>Between the reactionaries and the uncompromising Communist Party who occupy a dominant position in the government (I must state that the Communist Party did not express such uncompromising views in February), there is now a question: How to make the peace and happiness of the Chinese people, who have suffered and are currently in a divided stage, a reality. The reactionaries in the government apparently believed that no matter what they did, they would be able to obtain the help of the United States. The Communist Party is unwilling to compromise for the interests of the country. They believe that the economic collapse will bring down the government, and they deeply advocate widespread guerrilla warfare along the railway lines, which will accelerate the collapse of the government, and disregard the suffering of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Based on my observations, the only way to save this situation is to have the free members and minority parties in the government take the lead. The minority parties are a collection of outstanding people, but they still lack the political power to implement control. I believe that under the leadership of Chairman , such groups, if they can work together to promote their work, will surely achieve the goal of unity through a good government.</p>
<p>In fact, the National Assembly has already formulated a democratic constitution, the main parts of which are in line with the original intentions decided by the political consultative conference of various parties in January last year. Unfortunately, the Communist Party failed to think that it could participate in this conference, and the constitution passed by the conference seems to include their main requirements.</p>
<p>The Chinese government will soon carry out major reorganizations, and elections will be completed and the constitution will be implemented before the 1947 Saint . Now that the form of democratic China has been laid down by the newly revised constitution, the actual steps will become a trial. As for the extent to which the government can sincerely welcome all parties to actively assume government responsibilities and work to enrich the form of democratic China, it remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The first step will be to reorganize the National Government Committee and the administrative departments of the government pending the implementation of the constitution. The method of implementing the reorganization and the number of representative seats for free members and non-Kuomintang members will be of great importance. We also hope that during this transitional period, the Communist Party or other groups will still have the opportunity to participate in the government and jointly assume responsibility for China's future.</p>
<p>The period of training under the rule of the Kuomintang has come to an end, and this has already been formally stated on record. If the political rule of one party truly ends, then the Kuomintang should stop receiving government funding.</p>
<p>What I have said is frank and unreserved, because only in this way can I hope that the American people will understand this complicated issue. I have expressed this view during the negotiations, and I believe that most of the individuals involved are already aware of it. I am making it public now because it is my duty to present my estimates of this situation and all its possibilities to the Americans who are deeply concerned about all developments in the Far East.

Special Envoy Marshall originally went to report to President Truman in person; however, one and a half hours after General Marshall left our capital, news came from the United States reporting that President Truman had nominated General Marshall as Secretary of State, succeeding Byrnes. At the same time, General Marshall's original intention to issue a statement on the Chinese situation after arriving in the U.S. capital was also advanced and released after the general left Beijing. The rapid development of this situation, unfolding to such a high degree in such a short period of time, was truly beyond the expectations of ordinary people. This is truly like the dropping of an atomic bomb; we, who are directly affected by this atomic bomb, truly do not know how to express our feelings.</p>
<p>First of all, we cannot but express our heartfelt gratitude to General Marshall. Over the past year, General Marshall, in the capacity of President Truman's special envoy, has tirelessly worked for the unification and peace of China, his efforts untiring. This spirit has moved every kind Chinese person. General Marshall's efforts in China have not failed. Because of his efforts, we have seen the convening of the "Political Consultative Conference" and the resolutions it established, especially the resolution on the unified reorganization of the army. This was supported by both the government and the Communist Party. Although the unified reorganization has not yet been fully realized, the establishment of this agreement alone is sufficient to indicate General Marshall's success in China. Moreover, the Constitution of the Republic of China passed by this National Assembly has also been greatly influenced by General Marshall's inspiration. This constitution is a crystallization of all parties not adhering to their prejudices and is a good manifestation of the spirit of tolerance. What the Chinese people should be forever grateful for is that the making of this constitution coincided with General Marshall's stay in China. The manifestation of this spirit of tolerance was undoubtedly due in part to General Marshall's inspiration. On this point alone, General Marshall's contributions to the Chinese people are sufficient to be known for all time. When the general flew to Shanghai and went to Beijing to take office on December 20th of last year, this newspaper wrote a welcoming editorial, which contained the sentence: "At present, the enemy has surrendered, and it is precisely the time for us to actively build the country. Our great ally has specially sent an envoy like Marshal Marshall to China, which truly makes us think of the past when France, which had the same ideals of nation-building as the United States, sent an outstanding military and political figure to the United States at the beginning of the founding of the United States. We hope that the influence of Marshal Marshall's visit to China on the Chinese people will be as great as the influence of Lafayette on the American people." Now that the Constitution of China is imprinted with the spirit of General Marshall, it can stand alongside the Republic of China for thousands of years. Not only is our wish not in vain, but it is also sufficient to show General Marshall's success in China. Now that the general is leaving China and returning home, we cannot help but feel reluctant to part.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we want to say is to congratulate General Marshall on his new appointment. General Marshall will go to serve as the U.S. Secretary of State. President Truman's decision to entrust this responsibility to Marshal Marshall at this time is the wisest decision. Since the death of the late President Roosevelt, American politics has suddenly lost its center of gravity. President Truman, with his extraordinary talent, at an extraordinary time, assumed an extraordinary responsibility. His situation was difficult, as everyone knows. Because he has extraordinary talent, he can use his extraordinary wisdom, so since he assumed his extraordinary responsibility, he has been able to handle himself well in various contradictions. The Secretary of State is responsible for negotiation and compromise, especially after the war, when American diplomacy is admired by all countries. Byrnes also had extraordinary talent and assumed the extraordinary responsibility of Secretary of State; since taking office, he has made many contributions to the implementation of American national policy, which aroused dissatisfaction among young politicians. We then saw attacks by figures like former Secretary of Commerce Wallace. This attack not only greatly affected Byrnes, who was in the position of Secretary of State, but also greatly affected the prestige of the United States itself. Fortunately, President Truman made a wise decision and dismissed the Secretary of Commerce. Although this somewhat salvaged the reputation of the United States, the wounds of Wallace's attack have not yet fully healed. Last year, the Republican Party also raised its head in Congress. At this time, President Truman had no choice but to let the meritorious Byrnes retire. And at this time, there is no one else who can take on the position of Secretary of State other than General Marshall. Why do we say this? Now the administrative head of the United States is President Truman, who belongs to the Democratic Party; but the Democratic Party can no longer control the U.S. Congress, the highest legislative body - the Republican Party has been able to control Congress as a result of the last election. The first thing the American people care about now is diplomacy, and the second is domestic politics. Byrnes, who belongs to the Democratic Party, cannot but seek to leave at this time; and his successor must be a non-partisan figure, and at the same time must be able to obtain the unanimous support of the country. Who else could it be other than General Marshall? We express our infinite joy at General Marshall's new appointment. Because at this time, only a person with General Marshall's talent can take on this new appointment. The Chinese people have known General Marshall's outstanding talent for the past year, and with his experience in China over the past year, we firmly believe that General Marshall's new appointment will not only be able to perform his duties happily, but also make Sino-American relations closer. We firmly believe that this five-star marshal, who was able to defeat the Axis with his extraordinary talent, will surely be able to bring lasting peace to the post-war world. We hereby wish the general success in his new mission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what we cannot but mention is the statement issued by General Marshall upon his departure. In this statement, we can see General Marshall's concern for the Chinese situation and his soldierly frankness. We do not want to comment too much on this statement. Now General Marshall is leaving China and returning home to take on a new appointment. This new appointment will undoubtedly affect the safety and security of the entire era. General Marshall is returning from China and will undoubtedly be able to decide on the actions to be taken from a broader perspective. The development of the Chinese situation to the present stage has its historical background. General Marshall is now in a broader perspective, and we firmly believe that this will be of great benefit to the improvement of the Chinese situation. How to promote Sino-American relations after General Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, General Marshall may already have a plan in mind, but standing in the position of the Chinese people, we are willing to further state our views in another article.</p>

Since the beginning of winter, abandoned infants have been found from time to time in fields and on embankment sides, but most of them have been bitten to death by cats and dogs, with incomplete limbs and heads. Before the New Year, someone even hung a basket of three naked infants at the gate of the infant welfare center in the town at night and left them to freeze to death, which was too horrible to bear.

<h3>Ningbo Municipality Establishment Issue: Local Gentry Telegraph the Provincial Government to Postpone Discussion: The People's Hardships Have Not Recovered, and There Are No Conditions for Being Called a Municipality</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ningbo] Regarding the issue of restoring the establishment of Ningbo as a municipality, the province originally planned to restore the establishment this year and sent Chen Zongen, an inspector from the Civil Affairs Department, to Ningbo to delineate the city boundary in conjunction with the Sixth Special District Office and the Zheng County Government and draw detailed diagrams, which were submitted to the province for verification. Now, it is learned that Sun Biaoqing, Zhao Zhishi, Zhang Zhongzhi and other gentlemen from Ningbo believe that the establishment of Ningbo as a municipality is unnecessary, and they specially telegraphed the provincial government, requesting to postpone the discussion. The original telegram is as follows: "We have learned from newspapers that the proposal to establish Ningbo as a municipality has been approved and will be established soon. The general public is panicked, and informed people know that this is not a good plan. According to the experience in the 16th year of the Republic of China, when it was established once, it was ultimately because various conditions did not meet the standards for establishing a municipality, so the governance was not satisfactory, the results were difficult to speak of, and the people were not able to receive the actual benefits of the municipality, and they could not bear the burden of government expenses. The central government, in view of this, immediately ordered the abolition. The loss of the previous vehicle is not far away. After the disaster, the wounds have not healed, the people's hardships have not recovered, and the maintenance and care of the trees are still needed, and the livelihood needs to be restored. How can we change the governance institutions and increase the burden on the people? After the war, there was much destruction, the refugees have not returned, the people's livelihood is exhausted, all the conditions that can be called a city, the construction of public facilities, the burden of financial resources, are not only not better than before the 16th year, and the railway has not been restored, the highway has not been repaired, the maritime atmosphere is not peaceful, the number of ships has decreased, the transportation is difficult, the rural areas are bankrupt, the high interest rates are oppressed, the industry and commerce are collapsing, the unemployment is increasing, the housing is in a panic, compared with the situation when the city was established in the 16th year, the general financial resources of the people are even less than one thousandth of the past. If the city is established again, the number of institutions will increase, the organization will be large, and the people's financial burden will be unbearable. We have observed this situation and believe that it is unnecessary for Ningbo to establish a municipality at present. Therefore, we telegraphed to your Excellency for verification, and we hope that you will temporarily postpone the discussion in order to reduce the burden on the people. It is for your convenience."</p>

<h3>Future Diplomatic Trends of the United States Closely Watched by All Countries in the World; British Labor Party to Conduct New Review of Bevin's Policies</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] British government officials were shocked when news of the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes and the succession of Marshall reached here. It is heard that Foreign Secretary Bevin and Prime Minister Attlee will hold further talks to discuss the impact of Marshall's appointment as Secretary of State on U.S. foreign policy, especially regarding the situation in Palestine and what policy Marshall will adopt.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 8th] Sources here say that Marshall's succession to Byrnes as Secretary of State can be seen as a rightward shift in U.S. foreign policy. Britain is anxiously awaiting Moscow's negative reaction, as Moscow has recently severely criticized U.S. policies, accusing them of "imperialist aims" throughout the Pacific region. Conversely, the Soviet government has always valued military leaders and may therefore react favorably to Marshall.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 7th] The British Labor Party announced today that the party will hold a series of informal meetings across the country starting in February to inform members of the government's foreign policy. Foreign Secretary Bevin and other cabinet ministers will give speeches. Since the Labor Party discovered a number of dissident members at the end of last year, the party leader has launched an "education" campaign, and next month's lecture will be the latest step.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Diplomatic circles here expect that the new U.S. Secretary of State Marshall will continue to improve U.S.-Soviet relations. News of Byrnes's resignation was met with surprise here. It was generally believed that although Byrnes's resignation was possible after the Republican election victory, his achievements in drafting treaties with Germany's former satellite states and consulting with Republican senators on matters of national interest had greatly strengthened his position. His resignation now is likely a political competition of parties, and the Democratic Party intends to retain him.</p>

<h3>French Paratroopers Land in Nam Dinh to Rescue Besieged French Troops; Only the Use of Force Can Resolve the Vietnam Incident</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 8th] The French Minister for Overseas Territories, Moutet, left here by air to return to France today, accompanied by his son, Gustave, and entourage, after inspecting Vietnam.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] The French Colonial Minister, Moutet, who went to Vietnam to conduct an on-site investigation, is scheduled to depart for France tomorrow. He gave a radio speech in Saigon today, stating that the conflict in Vietnam is a large-scale war and that his mission has failed. Only military force can restore order. Mr. Moutet said, "I came here to carry out peaceful work, but unexpectedly, what I saw was a large-scale war. If we want to regain security, France must continue military operations. We have been attacked, we are now defending ourselves, and we will never be subdued by riots."</p>
<p>French military commander in Vietnam, General Leclerc, reiterated the battle results and claimed that the French army is expanding the "safe zone," but Leclerc also admitted that a small number of French troops defending near Nam Dinh are under siege by Viet Minh troops and are fighting independently.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] The French General Staff announced today that French paratroopers landed successfully near Nam Dinh, 80 miles southeast of Hanoi, on a moonlit night. They immediately occupied a bridgehead on the Red River to relieve the Europeans trapped in the local textile factory and to clear out the Viet Minh troops in the city.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] According to reliable sources, the Palestine problem group conference is scheduled to resume in London on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Truman's Policy Plans Will Encounter Difficulties in Congress; Republicans Oppose Universal Military Training and Insist on Reducing Income Taxes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman's administrative policies and the Republican Congress are already at odds. This division will widen when the President presents his budget proposal to save the economy from depression and restore prosperity tomorrow afternoon. Currently, the President's plans have sparked the following disputes: (1) The President plans to submit a budget proposal of $37 billion for the next fiscal year, which the Republicans have opposed. It is said that the President's budget message will state that the surplus is less than $1.5 billion, which must be used to pay off the national debt of around $253 billion. Most Republicans say that strict austerity measures could reduce income taxes by 20% and still reduce the national debt. (2) Most members of Congress have paid little attention to the President's proposal to establish a 20-member committee to investigate ways to prevent strikes. (3) The President's proposal to merge the Army and Navy Departments seems to have a chance for further review in the new Congress. However, there is general opposition to universal military training and support for allowing the wartime conscription law to expire on March 31 this year.</p>
<h3>Regarding General Elections in Poland, the United States Sends Notes to Britain and the Soviet Union Accusing the Polish Government of Taking Oppressive Measures; Polish Peasant Party Plans to Boycott Elections</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The U.S. State Department revealed today that the U.S. government sent notes to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky and British Ambassador Balfour on January 5, accusing the Polish government of engaging in oppressive measures, such as arresting people with different political views through political scrutiny, murder and intrusion into homes, and suppressing freedom of the press. The notes expressed deep concern about these phenomena and stated that if they are not stopped immediately, democratic elections in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement cannot be held. It is reported that the U.S. Ambassador to Warsaw received a memorandum from Polish Peasant Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister Mikolajczyk on December 18, revealing the Polish government's suppression of the Peasant Party and its denial of political freedom. Mikolajczyk said that the methods of suppression include arrests, assassinations, forcing Peasant Party members to join groups such as the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, dismissing Peasant Party members from their jobs, and searching their homes. In addition, the publication or circulation of Peasant Party newspapers is prohibited or restricted, and the editor of the party newspaper has been arrested. The note continued that these phenomena have an impact on Polish elections, but are more important in relation to the principles of international agreements. Therefore, the U.S. government, as a signatory to the Potsdam Agreement, believes that it cannot fulfill its duties if it cannot do its best to implement the agreement. Therefore, it believes that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union should urge the Polish government to pay attention to its failure to comply with its obligations under the agreement in the most friendly but most resolute manner.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 7th] Poland is about to hold general elections. According to Polish Peasant Party Chairman Mikolajczyk, a large number of the party's ballots have been invalidated, and 2 million voters belonging to the party will be unable to vote. The party's executive committee will meet to decide whether to boycott the general election, but this move will depend on how the Director-General of Elections responds.</p>

<h3>Full Text of President Truman's Speech at the Joint Session of the US Senate and House of Representatives (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Labor-Management Relations</p>
<p>In the past year – especially the year following the First World War – labor disputes have been incessant.</p>
<p>Although this economic war erupted in 1946, we are now producing a considerable amount of goods and services. However, improving the methods by which labor and management reach agreements and reducing the number of strikes and work stoppages is essential.</p>
<p>We should not adopt punitive bills. We should not pass regulations that inevitably restrict the normal activities of labor in order to punish a few labor leaders. We should not take ill-considered actions driven by emotion that jeopardize our American freedoms and invite unforeseen disasters. When reviewing the record of labor-management disputes in 1946, we should be aware that labor and management failed to reach agreements to end labor unrest. Management is also not without fault. Therefore, we should realize that industrial peace cannot be achieved solely through laws targeting labor unions.</p>
<p>In the past fifteen years, we have established a national labor policy based on the principle of free collective bargaining to determine wages and working conditions.</p>
<p>That national policy remains unchanged. This labor policy should continue to be the national policy.</p>
<p>However, there are still those among us who do not understand what free and fair bargaining is. We also do not fully understand how to fulfill the mutual responsibilities that come with the right to negotiate. Currently, we have some harmful provisions that limit the effectiveness of the collective bargaining system. Moreover, we lack government agencies to help labor and management resolve differences.</p>
<p>Some labor issues should be addressed immediately, while others, due to their complexity, require detailed investigation and research. We should pass legislation to correct some errors and provide for more government assistance in labor-management negotiations. We should also deeply understand the core of labor-management difficulties by putting ourselves in their shoes.</p>
<p>In view of the above, I recommend and urge you to implement the following four-point plan to reduce industrial strife:</p>
<p>First Point</p>
<p>To pass laws as soon as possible to prevent certain improper regulations. First, what is below is the strike caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions for control. The people and the management are innocent bystanders in this kind of strike, but they are greatly damaged by the conflict between the hostile trade unions. This kind of dispute harms production, industry, the people, and the workers themselves. I think it is difficult to prevent strikes caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions for control.</p>
<p>The National Labor Relations Act stipulates a procedure for determining which union represents the employees of a particular employer. However, in some strikes caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions for control, the minority union declares a strike and forces the employer to negotiate with it, ignoring the legal responsibility of negotiating with the majority union. It is inexcusable to force employers to violate the law by striking. It is necessary to pass resolutions to prevent this kind of strike.</p>
<p>Another kind of disharmony between trade unions is the strike caused by disputes between trade unions involving certain issues, that is, the issue of which trade union should be responsible for completing a specific job. When rival trade unions cannot resolve such disputes on their own, the authorities should have some provisions to peacefully resolve the issue.</p>
<p>The next kind of improper regulation is sympathy strikes, which often deepen the conflicts caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions, or force employers to violate the National Labor Relations Act.</p>
<p>Not all sympathy strikes are abnormal. We should judge them by their goals. In other words, sympathy strikes intended to protect wage rates and working conditions are different from those intended to deepen the conflicts caused by the struggle between trade unions and trade unions. The industrial structure sometimes requires unions to extend certain conflicts beyond the scope of a particular employer. We should not indiscriminately prohibit sympathy strikes. Our goal should be to formulate those that prohibit sympathy strikes with ill intentions, and we should not endanger the right of trade unions to survive and strive for the benefits of genuine collective bargaining. '</p>
<p>The next regulation that urgently needs to be corrected is the use of economic power by labor and management to determine issues arising from the interpretation of existing contracts.</p>
<p>Collective bargaining agreements, like other contracts, should be adhered to by both parties. In the most enlightened labor-management relations, disputes arising from the interpretation of contract content are resolved peacefully through negotiation or arbitration. We should enact legislation to establish an agency that allows labor and management to request arbitration when problems arise in interpreting existing contracts.</p>
<p>Second Point</p>
<p>Is to expand the convenience of assisting collective consultation within the Labor Department.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties we have in avoiding labor disputes is the lack of order in the process of collective consultation. Labor and management often do not understand their responsibility to resolve disputes through automatic negotiation. We often see examples of labor or management using economic power instead of trying to reach an agreement through consultation. Neither labor nor management nor the government has a definite way to determine how government assistance can be elicited. Government agencies should take mediation or arbitration steps to determine the facts of the dispute and report to the public. This agency should facilitate and expedite the resolution of disputes.</p>
<p>Third Point</p>
<p>Is to investigate our social and established plans in order to alleviate the causes of workers' insecurity.</p>
<p>In my message vetoing the Case Bill on June 11, 1946, I outlined my views on labor-management relations. What I said at that time, I will repeat again now: The solution to labor-management difficulties can be found not only in legislation directly related to labor relations, but also in a plan whose purpose is to eliminate the causes of insecurity felt by many workers in our industrial society. For example, Congress should consider extending and expanding our social security system, improving housing problems, a national health plan, and a provision for a fair minimum wage.</p>
<p>Fourth Point</p>
<p>Is to establish a temporary joint committee to study overall labor-management relations.</p>
<p>I recommend that Congress establish such a temporary joint committee to conduct this extensive study.</p>
<p>The President, Congress, and labor and management all have the responsibility to continue to cooperate in order to find a solution to labor problems. Now I suggest that this committee be organized as follows: Congress should elect twelve members from the members of the two houses of the two parties, and the President should appoint eight representatives of the people and representatives of labor. The committee shall be responsible for conducting investigations and recommendations on major issues. The main problems include:</p>
<p>First, national strikes in various important industries that affect the public interest. In addition, the committee should study how to deal with and prevent strikes at the same time without harming democratic freedom.</p>
<p>The future of the entire industry in the United States depends on the proper resolution of these strike issues. The far-reaching impact of national strikes in transportation, coal mining, oil, steel, and telecommunications is to create national turmoil. We have recently used special wartime legislation to avoid these turmoils, but these special wartime powers will soon be abolished. These powers must be replaced by another appropriate and effective system and institution. This issue requires our careful study and courageous response. However, this method of response must be in line with the protection of our people's rights. This need is urgent, and the committee must pay attention to this matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Second, is the best method and steps to achieve collective bargaining. This point should include that labor and management can negotiate freely and fairly, and avoid strikes and deadlocks as much as possible before the negotiation and coordination completely fail.</p>
<p>Third, is the internal factors of labor and management disputes. Some of these factors require long-term research. However, the committee can immediately consider some other issues and immediately submit recommendations to Congress.</p>
<p>I recommend that the committee complete a report including legislative recommendations by March 15, 1947.</p>
<p>(To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>Zhang Wei Severely Criticized, Expresses Deep Frustration, Submits Two Points of Review Opinion to the General Assembly for Public Discussion, Aftermath of the Garbage Truck Case, Emergency Panel Meeting Held to Discuss</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Regarding the temporary motion at the previous general meeting of the Municipal Council's Health Committee regarding the private corruption and malfeasance of the Health Bureau's garbage trucks, an urgent review was needed. Therefore, an emergency panel meeting was held at 5 pm yesterday in the reception room of Zhengshi Middle School, chaired by Fan Shouyuan, with Director Zhang Wei attending to report on the handling of the matter again. He said: After I learned about the private affairs of the drivers, I sent staff to disguise themselves and secretly investigate at midnight. Previously, it was discovered that six garbage trucks were running private affairs, and later another seven were discovered. According to the report: "The drivers agreed with the vegetable vendors that each time they privately brought vegetables to the vegetable vendors, the price was 400 to 700 yuan." I immediately requested the mayor to dismiss them and expel the leaders. However, the drivers' lives are difficult and worthy of sympathy. Although the matter has been repeatedly submitted to the Cleanliness Committee, Municipal Council meetings for discussion, and reported to the mayor personally, there has been no proper solution. I also discussed solutions with Liu Hongsheng, who advocated selling the garbage trucks to the drivers for safekeeping, with the municipal government drawing 60% as repayment of the truck price, but it was also not realized due to various difficulties. Director Zhang also stated that he was not protecting his subordinates, but although there are a few bad elements in the bureau who endanger the regulations, at the same time, there are indeed many personnel who are dedicated to their duties and work hard. He felt deeply frustrated by the heavy criticism from the councilors and said: "I have resigned to the mayor four times, but all four times were not approved, but at my age, I dare not leave without saying goodbye. I am extremely willing to accept your strict handling, and at the very least, give me a dismissal." After speaking, Director Zhang complied with the councilors' request and withdrew.</p>
<h3>Councilors Express Opinions, Attitudes Vary</h3>
<p>The attending councilors expressed their opinions on the case, and their attitudes varied. Some believed that the driver's responsibility was small and the director's responsibility was great. Although the driver's difficult life could be sympathized with, the issue of discipline could not be ignored and must be dealt with strictly. The mayor also knew that the law was being violated but did not stop it, and should also be held responsible. Councilor Zhao Junhao expressed that although Director Zhang's handling of the case was inappropriate, the drivers were unwilling to work because their salaries were too low, making it extremely difficult for the director to handle matters. In terms of reason and sentiment, it was forgivable, so he suggested that the General Assembly dismiss the illegal garbage truck drivers and then find another way to deal with it. Councilor Lu Shidao, who attended the meeting, provided two points of opinion: (1) The salaries of public officials are meager, and private affairs are inevitable. Sympathy is possible, but the municipal councilors have the responsibility to supervise the municipal government. The dignified director admits to this incident in the General Assembly and allows it to act as such. If this continues, the municipal councilors will not need to discuss it in the future. Speaking from an objective position, the director's difficulties in handling affairs should be forgiven, but the director should consider how much power he has beforehand. This is his incompetence. (2) The Municipal Council has already raised this matter and everyone is paying attention to it. If it ends without a result, where is our justice? Therefore, this matter must be handled solemnly.</p>
<p>However, Councilor Mei Bingfan believed that in terms of reason and sentiment, the director should be treated leniently and not made too embarrassed. If you want to deal with it strictly, you should find out whether the director has committed fraud, and you cannot do it arbitrarily.</p>
<h3>Two Points of Opinion</h3>
<p>After discussion and approval, the result was based on the draft review report submitted by Councilor Chen Cunren, which was then revised by the entire committee, and two points were formulated: (1) The Director of the Health Bureau should be held responsible for acknowledging that the illegal behavior of his subordinates is legal, and should guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. (2) In order to rectify the discipline of public officials, a letter should be sent to the municipal government to severely punish the staff involved in the case, and report the handling situation to this council. The Health Committee has no right to resolve the above review report, and it must be submitted to the General Assembly for review.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wei's Oral Reply on General Health Issues</h3>
<p>Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei verbally replied to the questions raised the other day, stating: The municipal hospital is self-sufficient because of insufficient funding in the past. Although it is said to be self-sufficient now, the municipal government still provides subsidies. Previously, there were 531 beds distributed in various hospitals. Now, it has been changed to a preferential method, which can subsidize more patients. As for the municipal hospital's distribution being average and the quantity being large, it cannot be said to be a merger now, but an adjustment of distribution, an increase in capacity, no increase in staff, and expenses can be saved. The issue of feces and urine also requires special handling. Now that it has been taken back for self-management, although there are cadres, there is still a feeling of difficulty in management. It is not yet certain whether to invite merchants to contract for it. People are being asked to study it. Regarding restricting the fees charged by private hospitals, I frankly say: No doctor has made a fortune. If there is a fortune, it is due to a side business; as for the treatment of patients in private hospitals, if there is any, it will be dealt with severely. The issue of the Guohua Funeral Home was reviewed during the tenure of former Director Yu and was not enemy property, so it was returned. The school's collection of health fees is taken from students and used for students, and has nothing to do with regular health expenses. Regarding whether the Health Bureau's staff has been reduced, it has followed the resolution of the Municipal Council to reduce the administrative staff. The problem of rabies-bitten dogs relapsing after vaccination may be related to the bite site. The same is true all over the world, and about 3% cannot be saved. Due to time constraints, those who have not answered other questions will be answered in writing.</p>
<h3>The Third Meeting of the Municipal Council Will Be Held Today, Panel Review Meeting</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The second general meeting of the Municipal Council held its third meeting yesterday afternoon. First, the directors of the Police, Social Affairs, Health, and Education Bureaus answered questions from the second meeting. Then, the councilors raised questions to the directors of the Finance, Land Administration, Public Utilities, and Public Works Bureaus. The Health Committee held a temporary meeting to discuss the garbage truck private affairs case and decided on two review reports to be submitted to the General Assembly for public discussion.</p>
<p>Today's agenda will be the first and second panel review meetings, which will be held at the Municipal Council in Fuming Village and the China Merchants Bureau, respectively. Also, in order to discuss the budget in detail, the trial meeting is scheduled to hold two budget committee meetings on the morning of the 10th and 12th, and a general meeting on the morning of the 11th, specifically to discuss the budget for this year.</p>

<h3>Request to Increase Tuition Fees at All Levels, Establish a Women's Normal School, Director of Education Bureau Answers Questions</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Director of the Education Bureau Gu Yuxiu answered questions at yesterday's General Assembly: (1) The education expenses up to November totaled 1.8 billion yuan, and some expenses were not included. The newly added national education classes in October, November, and December cost 1.3 billion yuan, including living subsidies for teachers and staff. The municipal schools have prepaid more than 2 billion yuan, and the municipal government has approved 3.7 billion yuan, but it has not yet been received. It is planned to repay 60% of the municipal schools' hot money by the end of this year, but the Finance Bureau has not yet raised funds. (2) The radio education station has been included in this year's work plan and should be implemented. (3) In order to tighten the organization, the art normal school has been merged into the normal school, but the art normal school is indeed necessary. Please consider re-establishing it so that it can be established. (4) The fee standard for private schools in the second semester of last year was 80,000 to 120,000 yuan for elementary schools, 120,000 to 160,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 160,000 to 200,000 yuan for high schools. According to the cost of living index last month, it has increased by 45% compared to the previously set tuition fees. Now, in order to take care of both, it is planned to increase it by 25%. Please re-set elementary schools to 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, junior high schools to 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, and high schools to 200,000 to 250,000 yuan. (5) Municipal elementary and secondary school teachers have requested subsidies for academic advancement fees. Please submit it to the municipal government and ask the General Assembly to allocate it in the budget. The above three points have been listed by the mayor as a referral case and sent to the General Assembly for public decision yesterday. (6) The municipal sports field has repeatedly negotiated with the military authorities to recover it, but no result has been obtained. It has now been requested that the municipal government submit a claim for compensation to the Ministry of National Defense. (7) The procedures for registering private schools will be handled leniently and quickly. (8) There are currently 112 schools in suburban areas, and more than 1,500 national education classes have been established, accounting for more than half of the total. If there are houses, it is still planned to add more. The funds for the dedicated school can be used for national schools first. (9) Private schools should set up 25% for free regulations for children of public teachers, but the investigation results show that Gu Jun only has 15%. Now, it has been notified again. (10) The Women's Normal School is planned to be converted from the former Kindergarten Normal School. It is currently consulting with the Executive Yuan. It will be established after the overseas Chinese orphanage is closed. (11) If there are any personnel affiliated with the Education Bureau, please report it, and it will be dealt with seriously. Also, if the Municipal Council believes that there are too many school teachers, they can also be reduced.</p>
<h3>Department of Social Affairs Answers Questions</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Director of the Department of Social Affairs Wu Kaixian answered the councilors' questions regarding the department at yesterday's General Assembly, saying: (1) The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee is organized according to the separate laws and regulations stipulated by the Executive Yuan and adopts a collegial approach. The Department of Social Affairs is responsible for mediation, and its evaluation scope is limited to those with city-wide characteristics. (2) There are three public pawnshops that have already been established, and it is planned to establish several more. After the expiration, bidding will be held. The regulations stipulate that if the bidding amount exceeds the original fixed amount, the excess amount can be taken back with the pawn ticket. The first phase is about to be held. If the results are good, it will continue to be held. Public pawnshops will also be established in appropriate locations in the civilian area. (3) It has been decided to formally establish the Women's Shelter after the winter relief shelter for the cold is closed and dispersed.</p>
<h3>There is no Market for Domestic Cotton Because the Fibers are too Short</h3>
<p>(4) There is no market for domestic cotton. It is not that yarn factories are unwilling to use it, but that the cotton fibers are too short. Efforts are now being made to improve cotton seeds. (5) The property of the Jing'an Temple involves judicial issues. Because the host of the temple is suspected of being a traitor, his autonomy cannot be deprived before the court's verdict. (6) Commercial registration is in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. If two companies with the same brand name register at the same time, they must be reviewed first. Otherwise, the first registrant has priority. (7) Regarding winter relief, the purpose is to obtain donations, and the method cannot be taken into account. In the previous election of Miss Shanghai, more than 2.1 billion yuan was raised to relieve the victims of Northern Jiangsu, with a net surplus of more than 300 million yuan, which is a large difference, but it can also relieve many refugees. This winter relief plans to raise 400 million yuan, and the charity ball can also collect 100 million yuan. (8) In order to enable child and refugee refugees to find their own jobs, we have now contacted the China Travel Service to set up training classes for them to serve as waiters at travel agencies around the country. We have also contacted China Aviation Corporation to set up wireless training classes. If successful, they can be held this year. In addition, refugees and refugee children are trained to repair cars. (9) Unemployed workers in the rear have already contacted various factories and arranged for two people to be placed among every ten people. More than 1,000 of the more than 2,000 workers now have jobs.</p>
<h3>Police Chief Answers Questions</h3>
<p>Acting Police Chief Yu Shuping gave an oral answer yesterday to the questions raised by the councilors to the police department the other day, saying: (1) Regarding the fire equipment fee issue, the previous General Assembly decided on 500 million yuan. It was submitted to the municipal government in December last year, but it has not been allocated so far. During the tenure of former Mayor Qian, 500 million yuan was allocated, and a contract was signed with Zhendan Company to order equipment. (2) Regarding the police treatment issue, after repeated adjustments, third-class police officers can now receive 146,004 yuan per month, and first-class police officers can receive 195,000 yuan. With the mayor's concern, each person is issued an additional five buckets of rice. In terms of welfare, each bureau has a public canteen, uniforms, and dormitories. In terms of education, there are children's schools. When sick, there is a police hospital, and bereavement expenses are given special treatment. In addition, due to the high cost of living, the mayor approved another 50,000 yuan for each person. (3) This bureau is only rectifying the city's appearance and not trying to beautify it. The volunteer police officers who are recruited must have graduated from junior high school and have a clean background to meet the standards. (4) The problem of bandits in Beixinjing is only due to the harassment of local hooligans, scattered soldiers, and ruffians. On Friday night last week, I personally supervised the suppression and arrested seven people and obtained two guns. No more robberies have been reported since then. (5) Regarding the adjustment of opium smokers, the address of the sleep cement is in the police hospital, the equipment is perfect, the facts are all there, please visit. (6) Regarding the abolition of the mounted patrol, the mounted patrol has its own existing effect. It is responsible for patrolling the suburbs and suppressing riots. It has a great effect. It also dispatched troops to Beixinjing to suppress bandits this time. Otherwise, it would not be so fast. All 250 horses were allocated by the Army Headquarters. (7) The penalties for violations are announced by each branch at the beginning of the month, 60% of which is handed over to the national treasury and 40% of which is used as bonuses. (8) The budget for the household registration survey work is 14 billion yuan, which is a support for the five-year plan, pending the public decision of the General Assembly. (9) The police museum is a police education tool, which is different from the museum of the Education Bureau. (10) The police hospital is set up for police welfare. It is necessary for business and criminal investigation and for the needs of prisoners and patients with diseases. It is necessary to retain it. (11) Regarding the hawker incident, this bureau is responsible for the implementation of the ban due to the repeated orders from the municipal government, the questions from the council, and the public opinion. After repeated persuasion and repeated extensions, no effect was achieved. The incident on November 28 has been investigated by Mayor Pan, Speaker, and Councilor Tang. (12) Regarding confiscated items, according to the Violation Penalty Law, the confiscated goods are jointly sold by the Municipal Government Lun Order with the Finance Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau Audit Office, and the proceeds are used for relief. (13) Regarding Councilor Zhang Zhihan's claim that he witnessed the police arbitrarily taking items from vendors, he hopes that in the future, when it occurs, he can report the police number and car number to the police station, which will definitely be dealt with according to law. Due to time constraints, other questions will be answered in writing later.</p>
<h3>Hotel Tax: Believed to be Without Legal Basis; The City Government Must Not Be Doing "Pickled Cucumber" Work</h3>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the questioning of the four bureaus of finance, land administration, public works, and public utilities, as well as the civil affairs office, began.</p>
<p>Regarding the finance department, Shao Yongsheng stated: The hotel tax has no legal basis. The previous general assembly did not approve it, and its tax rate is 20% of the room price, which exceeds the statutory tax rate even if it is considered a special tax. If it is said that the taxable objects are foreign transit passengers, because they are not responsible for municipal construction donations; then, if residents of this city leave Shanghai for Hangzhou, can they recover the municipal construction donations paid for a few days from the finance bureau, and will the Hangzhou municipal government also levy hotel taxes on Shanghai passengers? A dignified government cannot do this "pickled cucumber" work, as it is not in accordance with the law and lacks reason. Dong Ganwen stated: The finance bureau needs to re-examine the tax revenue itself. Qu Yue stated: Although the business license is handled by the finance bureau, there are procedures for investigating the health police and other bureaus. The official documents are exchanged and waited for approval, but it is unknown when they will be issued. It is hoped that the various bureaus of the municipal government will act quickly in the future.</p>
<h3>Actual Number of City Government Employees Differs from Budget</h3>
<p>Li Wenjie questioned two points: (1) When reviewing the recompiled budget for the second half of this year, according to the investigation report, the actual number of city government employees was 41,775 in July and August, 41,772 in September, 41,155 in October, and 43,959 in November and December. However, the budget submitted by the city government lists a total of 53,154 people, a difference of 10,000. What is the reason for this? (2) The budget expenditure for the security police in the second half of last year was 3.2 billion. However, by November of last year, the expenditure for regular and temporary expenses had reached more than 4.6 billion, not including December. What is the reason? Tang Shichang stated: I received a payment notice for the municipal construction donation on December 24 last year, which stated that it should be paid by December 19. After negotiations, it was extended to the end of December, but due to being busy, it was only paid on January 4, and a penalty of 10% was imposed. In the future, please the authorities carefully consider and extend the deadline for payment.</p>
<h3>Financial Accounts: Request for Disclosure</h3>
<p>Yang Fuzuo stated: The city government likes to open new taxes and does not like to sort out old taxes. Everyone knows that the items of municipal taxes and the high tax rates are complicated. Therefore, he requested three points: (1) The financial accounting authorities should be responsible for the accuracy of the budget figures. (2) They must also be responsible for the implementation of tax collection. (3) Financial accounts should be absolutely open, as open as possible, and quickly open.</p>
<h3>Labor Substitute Fee: Seems Unnecessary</h3>
<p>Zhu Yapu asked: (1) Does the city treasury have a surplus at the end of the year? If there is a surplus, how much is it? (2) In the budget for the 36th year, there is an item for labor substitute fee, which the general public is very dissatisfied with, considering it equivalent to a poll tax, which seems unnecessary. Zhong Yuliang stated: There are many inconsistencies in the grain strings in Baoshan and other suburban areas. The finance bureau should be requested to conduct joint investigation and registration with the land administration bureau, so as to have hope of clearing them up. Yu Chuanding requested the finance bureau to investigate and eliminate the corrupt practices of the collection office personnel. Sun Zhenchun stated that when school principals of the city schools collect funds from the city treasury, the staff of that office have an arrogant attitude and often show contempt and create difficulties, and give them the cold shoulder. The finance bureau should order them to correct their attitude in the future.</p>
<h3>Suspected of Embezzling and Selling Materials: Wang Gongxia Will Be Sent to Nanjing for Interrogation; Zhou Yunlong and Song An Were Also Detained</h3>
<p>Wang Gongxia, a former major general and deputy adjutant of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, is suspected of embezzling and selling materials during his tenure. Someone reported him to the highest authorities in Nanjing. It is reported that the Garrison Headquarters recently received a telegram from the Ministry of National Defense, ordering the headquarters to quickly detain Wang Gongxia and his accomplices Zhou Yunlong (former lieutenant colonel adjutant of the Garrison Headquarters) and Song An (former colonel section chief of the Japanese Overseas Management Office), and send the three criminals, together with the original case, to the Military Law Office of the Ministry of National Defense for interrogation. After receiving the order, the Garrison Headquarters arrested Zhou Yunlong at the Jiangwan Training Corps on the evening before last, arrested Song An at 467 Dixiwei Road, and summoned Wang Gongxia to the case at 7 Meiliyuan, Daxilu. They are currently sorting out the case files and will soon transfer them to the Military Law Office of the Ministry of National Defense for interrogation.</p>
<p>Involved in the Rong Desheng Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>[Another report] The occurrence of this case was actually caused by a case of embezzlement and sale of public property, which occurred a year ago. It is said that at that time, a warehouse that had been taken over was reported stolen. The thieves were arrested afterward and interrogated by the Military Law Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. So far, the criminals are still in custody. According to the situation at the time, the case involved a wide range of people, because the car used by the embezzlers belonged to Wang Gongxia, the former deputy adjutant of the Garrison Headquarters (editor's note: Wang was the deputy adjutant at the time, and the car used for the Rong Desheng kidnapping case last year was also borrowed by Wang). The key to the warehouse was kept by Song An, the colonel section chief of the General Affairs Section of the Japanese Overseas Management Office, so Zhu was also arrested after the case occurred. At the same time, Zhou Yunlong, the lieutenant colonel adjutant of the Garrison Headquarters, was also suspected of being involved. Later, Song was released on bail, and a year passed. Recently, it was learned that the Garrison Headquarters received a secret order from the Ministry of National Defense to send the relevant personnel in the case to Nanjing for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Mayor Says There is Hope for Recovering the Racecourse</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] According to Mayor Wu's remarks outside the meeting yesterday: There is considerable hope for the issue of recovering the racecourse. It is said that the Jockey Club may allow land to be exchanged for land, but it must be allowed to race horses on the land developed elsewhere. This case must be approved by the Senate before negotiations can proceed.</p>
<h3>One More Meeting, One More Tax Increase</h3>
<p>Zhu Yapu also stated: The public believes that every time the Senate holds a meeting, the people's taxes increase. Therefore, some are saying that it is better not to hold the meetings. Therefore, it is hoped that colleagues will carefully consider the municipal government's budget for the 36th year, taking into account whether the public can afford it.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of the Land Administration Department</h3>
<p>Regarding the land administration department, Shi Jiadong stated: Please publicize all the public land in the city by the land administration bureau and lease it to the public at a low price, so as to solve some of the housing shortage problems. Qu Yue and Gu Jinzao stated: Near the Meifu Oil Station in Zhujiaqiao, Pudong, the Japanese had enclosed 300 mu of land during the occupation period and used it as an anti-aircraft artillery position. After the victory, the residents had requested that it be returned. Now there is no news, and it is a pity to let it lie barren. Please investigate and clarify it quickly so that it can be cultivated and produced. Guo Jinzao also stated: He registered at Shenzhou on January 17, 35 and requested a land license, but there has been no result so far. In April of last year, he also applied for registration, but there has been no news. After inquiring, he was told that the registration paper had been lost. This should be investigated and clarified. Yu Chuanding stated: What is the result of the land administration bureau's investigation and handling of the more than 640 mu of public land illegally sold by the municipal government during the enemy-occupied period? There is no report. In addition, the number of mu often written on the land title issued by the bureau after land registration is less than the actual amount, and there is no case of writing more. Huang Bingquan stated: The land value tax has been levied, but the valuation is incorrect, and the taxpayer's ability to pay taxes is not taken into account. In the same area, the tax amount differs by three-quarters. What standard is used for valuation?</p>
<h3>Regarding the Issue of Limiting Electricity Use: Councilors Spoke Enthusiastically; Some Areas are Restricted, While Others are Not; Please Ask the Public Utilities Bureau Where the Control Capacity Lies</h3>
<p>The questioning of the public utilities department was particularly heated on issues such as restricting electricity use. Zhang Zhongyuan stated: Taxes must be added to the public, but electricity use must be restricted. The public does not even have the freedom to use very little electricity, let alone other things. Wang Jian'e stated: There is an overall doubt about the Public Utilities Bureau. If the restriction on electricity use is ordered by the Public Utilities Bureau, it has been implemented in the former French Concession area, but there is no restriction in the former International Settlement area. It is said that this is because the American Electric Power Company does not agree. At present, public utilities have Chinese, American, British, and French merchants, all of which are not within the scope of state-owned enterprises. If there is no control capacity, there is simply no need to set up a Public Utilities Bureau. What is the actual central work of the Public Utilities Bureau now? How effective is the restriction on electricity use? Ma Junshuo stated: It is now said that the French merchants have a generator arriving in Shanghai, and the restriction on electricity use seems to be able to be canceled. Director Zhao once said that the restriction measures could be revoked from February 1. Please give a definite answer.</p>
<p>Also, Wang Wei stated: Street lights are very important for traffic. The last general meeting decided to ask the Public Utilities Bureau to install them as soon as possible, but so far only half of the budget has been spent. Is it due to a shortage of materials? Or is it related to the issue of regional jurisdiction? Xu Zexiang stated: Residents of Nanshi and residents of the central area have the same obligations, but the rights they enjoy are different. This may be due to historical reasons. The enjoyment of tap water and electric lights has always been the same as in the central area, but recently, Nanshi often has power outages, and there are several times a day. Residents feel very inconvenient. Please ask whether this move by the Public Utilities Bureau is planned, or whether it can be notified in advance so that residents can be prepared.</p>
<h3>Ferry Fares: No Change Given</h3>
<p>Gu Jinzao stated: There are 120,000 people traveling to and from the Dongchang Road wharf every day. The Public Utilities Bureau stipulates that the ferry fare is 160 yuan. It is not easy for the public to prepare small change, and the Public Utilities Bureau does not give back 40 yuan. In this way, the extra income is more than 1 million yuan per day. Most of those traveling to and from the wharf are coolie workers. It is hoped that the bureau can improve the appropriate methods. In addition, the attitude of the ferry personnel on both sides of Dongchang Road is no different from the enemy-occupied period, and they should also be stopped. Yu Shun stated: Street traffic is still very congested. Are there any thorough improvement methods for traffic? The old Garbage Bridge is a shortcut to the North Railway Station and the court. Can tricycles and rickshaws be allowed to resume traffic? On some tram lines, passengers are crowded. Can the number of trams running be increased? Also, when calling the East District, you must first dial 02, which is not easy to get through. Can it be improved? Zhang Zhongyuan stated: When asking the telephone company to add an extension, the answer is "no." However, many electrical companies have such extensions. For commercial convenience, can the Public Utilities Bureau notify the telephone company to allow citizens who can buy extensions to install them easily?</p>
<h3>For Three Months, There is No Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Sense of Shame</h3>
<p>Also, the four large neon light characters for propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame on the roof of the International Hotel have been dark for three months recently. Shanghai cannot be without propriety, justice, integrity, and sense of shame. Can they be relit? Yan Guolian stated: Regarding the issue of banning rickshaws, the last general meeting decided to implement it in three years. This time, some National Assembly representatives also requested a temporary delay in the ban.</p>
<h3>Ignoring Both Sides While Repairing Roads; Neglecting Tributaries While Dredging Rivers</h3>
<p>Regarding the interrogation of the Public Works Bureau, Yan Guodong stated: The Public Works Bureau is currently conducting a joint investigation with the police department to demolish unlicensed shanties in restricted construction areas. However, the last general meeting decided that the ban should be temporarily postponed until the construction of civilian housing is completed. Shi Jiadong stated that there are many bamboo-and-straw houses in Zhabei, Nanshi. It is hoped that attention will be paid to them before construction. Zhou Lianze asked: According to the current survey, there are an estimated 60,000 shanties in Shanghai. It is said that only more than 700 have licenses. What is the Public Works Bureau doing? Hou Junren and Qu Yue questioned the dredging of rivers, stating that the Public Works Bureau only focuses on major rivers and ignores tributaries. More attention should be paid to them in the future to facilitate farmland irrigation. Since it has been listed as a central task this year, it should be carried out actively. Shi Jiadong stated that the construction of new roads only focuses on the middle of the road and ignores both sides. As a result, rickshaws also go to the flat road in the middle, and vehicle accidents occur frequently. It is hoped that attention will be paid to this point when constructing roads in the future. He also stated that since the city appearance is being rectified, why are there still enemy and puppet obstacles in the Xiaodongmen area? Sun Zhenchun stated that in the Jiahua Ferry, Fanhuangdu area in western Shanghai, the roads are muddy and waterlogged whenever it rains, which is difficult to travel. It is hoped that it can be improved. Yu Chuanding stated that the bureau should not listen to the one-sided reports of the road inspectors, and should conduct a detailed review, otherwise there will be many things that disturb the people. But Shanghai has now taken one-tenth of the country, and it should be temporarily implemented now.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Tax: Decision to Follow Central Government Regulations</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The City Senate is very concerned about the issue of reducing entertainment tax in the city. According to reliable sources yesterday: The City Senate has decided to follow the central government regulations and request the city government to reduce the entertainment tax to 25%. Although the city government's budget still exceeds 25%, the City Senate will not pass it.</p>
<h3>Temporary Approval Measures for Street Vendors Outside the Eleventh District Market Have Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Regarding the petition to the Senate by the stallholders outside the Eleventh District's vegetable market, City Senator Tang Shichang et al., Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei, and Police Bureau Director Fang Zhiyue jointly discussed the matter yesterday. As a result, it was agreed that stalls would be temporarily allowed to be set up under the principle of not violating traffic regulations. It was also decided that stalls would not be allowed to be set up outside the front gate of the Shanhai Road vegetable market, up to Shanhai Lane, and at the back up to Sande Lane. In other places, stalls are temporarily allowed to be set up along the roadside, but they are not allowed to be placed in the middle of the road. The time limit is tentatively set at two months. However, the police bureau stated that if order is maintained and traffic is not obstructed, the time limit can be extended and stalls can continue to be allowed to be set up.</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of Electric Company Petition for Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Yesterday, 160 Chinese employees of the Electric Company sent representatives, including Shen Tong, to petition the City Senate. They believe that the city government's mandatory reduction of the Shanghai Electric Company's employee benefits is detrimental to the harmonious relationship between labor and management. They also petitioned for a review of the company's employees' high efficiency plan. Was this plan reviewed and approved by the City Senate? Because the situation is urgent, they hope to uphold justice and correct it according to law. The speaker first assigned two senators, Huang Bingquan and Ye Xianggao, to represent the petitioners and reported: (1) The petitioners are all senior employees of the company; (2) They believe that the salary discount set by the "City Government's Cost of Living Index Application Committee" is inappropriate; (3) They expressed opposition to the Social Affairs Bureau's instruction that "employees of various public utility companies shall not retire at the time of demobilization unless they are over 60 years old or unable to work due to illness."</p>
<p>Later, because the petitioners requested that members of the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee meet with them, the speaker reassigned Ma Junshuo and Zhu Fuji to meet with them. The representatives further stated: (1) Does the resolution of the Cost of Living Index Application Committee have any legal basis for implementing the long-standing agreement between labor and management? (2) They requested that the city government's announced cost of living index be fully rewarded and issued according to the original company regulations based on the base salary. (3) The Social Affairs Bureau's method of gradually reducing the amount of employee retirement benefits is vastly different from the company's original method and affects work efficiency. Please handle it according to the company's original method. The senators immediately agreed to report the petition to the general assembly and submit it to the Legal Affairs and Social Affairs Committees for review and reply.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Occurs in Paris New Village</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] A murder case occurred in Paris New Village, Chongqing South Road yesterday morning. The victim was Jiang Fuchen, a Sipu, 38 years old, from Beiping, who had worked in the village for 12 years, and lived at No. 61, A. The night before, Jiang followed the usual practice of working the night shift. However, at about 3 a.m. yesterday morning, a resident of the village returned from outside. Because calling for the iron gate to be opened was unsuccessful, his wife, Ms. Jia (35 years old, from Zhejiang), became suspicious and hurriedly got up and searched the village. When she arrived at No. 96 (near Siwei Village) at the end of the village, she saw Jiang lying face down on the ground, vomiting blood. She felt him and found that he had died. She was extremely shocked and screamed. Nearby residents heard the sound and came out to look. In the dim light, they saw two fingernail marks on Jiang's neck, indicating that he had been strangled to death. At the same time, around 1 o'clock, someone had heard Jiang shout "You run!", followed by the sound of footsteps. Finally, they faintly heard "Help!" However, it was late at night, and it was drizzling, and after the "Help!" sound, there was no more sound, so they did not suspect anything else. Ms. Jia immediately reported the case to the Taishan Police Sub-bureau, which sent officers to investigate. Not far from the body, they found a wool hat and a net bag left behind by the murderer, which were immediately taken back to the police station. The body of the deceased was sent to the Tongren Fuyuantang autopsy room for examination. This reporter went to the scene of the incident yesterday to investigate. According to his colleague Li Shuchen, Jiang was usually kind and amiable to others, and was loyal to his duties, so he was ambushed this morning, probably because the gangster refused to be arrested.</p>
<h3>Youth Radio Station etc. Please Exempt from Closure</h3>
<p>"Youth", "New Movement", "Youth Culture", and "Seafarer" radio stations were also closed down yesterday. The persons in charge of each radio station convened an emergency joint meeting yesterday and jointly telegraphed the Garrison Headquarters, requesting a postponement of the ban, and telegraphed the Central Broadcasting Administration, requesting permission to establish the stations.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on the Manufacturing of Counterfeit American Cigarettes</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The Penglai Sub-bureau learned that there was a counterfeit American cigarette Marlboro Red Samsung machine at No. 6, Cishan Lane, Yingshi Road, and ordered police officers to arrest them. As a result, Fu Youfu, Wang Shouliang, and others were arrested, and the evidence was taken to the bureau.</p>

<h3>All Flight Personnel of China National Aviation Corporation Recommend the Central Government Improve Equipment and Propose Points Considered Minimum Conditions for Ensuring Safety; Director of Civil Aviation Administration Arrives in Shanghai to Supervise</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The flight personnel of the China National Aviation Corporation currently in this office, including Chinese pilots, co-pilots, navigators, and wireless telegraph operators, about 70 in number, and about 35 American pilots, wrote to Chairman Chiang, President Song, Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, and Director of Civil Aviation Administration Dai Anguo yesterday. The letter stated: The safety equipment for Chinese commercial flights is far from perfect. The modern aviation safety equipment used by various American airlines is mostly lacking. The letter also put forward several specific recommendations, which the flight personnel considered to be the minimum conditions for ensuring the safety of commercial flights.</p>
<p>They believe that these recommendations are purely for the purpose of ensuring the safety of future air passengers and assisting the sound development of Chinese aviation. The various recommendations are based on their daily flight experience over the past few years.</p>
<p>The main points of the recommendations are as follows: All obstacles at airports and landing sites must be removed. Airports and runways must be kept in good condition. Runway lights must maintain sufficient intensity. (Chinese commercial airports lack sufficient night flight equipment). All unnecessary buildings, towers, and ditches must be removed. Various flight wireless equipment should be managed and supervised by the government. All airports should have modern weather observation equipment. Weather reports should be continued 24 hours a day. Weather forecasts and wind direction at the destination should be reported to all intermediate stations. Various airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration and the Chinese Air Force authorities should consult on a nationally unified air traffic control. All stations should have qualified wireless personnel and equipment. All terminals should have qualified repair personnel and store sufficient equipment. The letter concluded that the above-mentioned equipment is either completely lacking or incomplete at Chinese commercial airports.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to thoroughly investigate the repeated accidents of airlines and to inspect all the aircraft and airport equipment of the China and Central Aviation Corporations, the Ministry of Transportation has specially dispatched Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to Shanghai to supervise and inspect everything on the spot. It is learned that Director Dai and Chen Zhuolin, general manager of the Central Aviation Corporation, and several others took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai the day before yesterday and arrived yesterday. After getting off the train, Dai drove to the Central Aviation Corporation for a short rest, and in the afternoon drove to Longhua Airport. First, he summoned the heads of the flight crew and radio groups of the China National Aviation Corporation and asked about the takeoff standard, communication situation, and landing guidance technology. The heads of the groups gave appropriate answers. He returned to the urban area at about 5 o'clock and is scheduled to continue inspecting various equipment in the next few days, and will summon the heads of various groups of the two companies at any time.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the heads of the two companies were summoned by Minister Yu after arriving in Nanjing the day before yesterday. Minister Yu was very angry about the re-accident of the China National Aviation Corporation in Qingdao, so he questioned General Manager Shen of the China National Aviation Corporation quite a bit and ordered him to prepare an accident report for aircraft No. 121 immediately. The heads of the two companies prepared detailed information on all the equipment of the two companies for submission to Minister Yu for review.</p>
<p>[Another report] General Manager Shen of the China National Aviation Corporation, Huazi, director of the flight crew, and others returned to Shanghai on a special plane to Nanjing yesterday. It is reported that when they flew over Nanjing the day before yesterday, they encountered snow, and the special plane circled in the air for 20 minutes before landing, which was quite dangerous. Yesterday, both mail and freight transportation in the valley resumed.</p>
<h3>Three Passenger Plane Disasters: Amnesty Does Not Intend to Pursue Further; Civil Aviation Plane Disasters in Qingdao; District Prosecutor's Office Investigating</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The prosecutors of the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, Wu Qihua, Cao Hong, and Ji Su, personally inspected the three aircraft disasters in Shanghai on Christmas last year at Jiangwan Longhua Airfield. They visited the China and Central Aviation Corporations to collect materials from various sources, and sent a letter to the Hankou District Court Prosecutor's Office requesting assistance in the investigation. They are currently waiting for a reply. However, the amnesty decree was promulgated on New Year's Day. Even if the two companies had operational negligence that caused death in the three aircraft disasters, the heaviest sentence would be no more than five years' imprisonment, which is usually included in the amnesty. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office does not intend to pursue its criminal responsibility further. However, their dereliction of duty is undeniable. After the prosecutor's investigation has a result, the entire case may be transferred to the Supervisory Commission for administrative punishment. Recently, China National Aviation Corporation's Flight No. 121 from Shanghai to Pinghu crashed again in Qingdao. After seeing the report, Huang Liang, the Chief Prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, believed that civil aviation aircraft had crashed repeatedly, providing no protection for passengers' lives. The company's negligence of duty should bear legal responsibility. Moreover, this accident occurred on January 5 this year, which is outside the time limit stipulated by the amnesty and cannot enjoy the benefits of the amnesty again. He specifically instructed prosecutors Ji Su and Shen Zushou yesterday afternoon to jointly be responsible for the investigation.</p>
<h3>Neglecting Preventive Plans; Human Efforts Greatly Deficient</h3>
<p>Supervisory Commission Pays Attention to Aircraft Accidents</p>
<p>The Central and China Aviation Corporations destroyed three aircraft at Longhua Jiangwan Airfield on the 25th of last month, and dozens of passengers were killed and injured. The Jiangsu District Supervisory Commission paid great attention and immediately sent personnel to investigate separately after the accident. In addition to reviewing weather reports and the back-and-forth telegrams between various aviation stations and aircraft, they also asked in detail about the airport equipment and rescue process. This reporter inquired with the Supervisory Commission yesterday about the progress of the investigation. They were told that the main reasons for this aircraft accident were the bad weather and the incomplete airport equipment. The company's negligence in preventive plans and human efforts were greatly deficient.</p>

<h3>Little Traitor of Wu County, Gong Jianxun, Under Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Gong Jianxun, who formerly served as the head of the Water Patrol Team of the puppet Wu County Police Bureau, was brought to trial at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Gong is a native of Wu County and originally made a living as a seal engraver. During the War of Resistance, he became closely acquainted with Cao Zhang Jue Shengzhi Shi of the enemy's military police and Special Agent Cao Zhang Jin Shengnan. In the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], he became the head of the Water Patrol Team of the puppet Wu County Police Bureau. After being reported by the Traitor Supervision Team of the Third Front Army's military police, two Mauser pistols, two wooden-holstered pistols, 495 rounds of ammunition, and four pistol holsters were seized from his home. He was detained and transported to Shanghai. Upon arriving at the Shanghai railway station, taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the escorts, including Chen Hairu, he took out the wooden-holster pistol from the transport box and wounded Chen Hairu in the leg while attempting to escape, but was unsuccessful. The defendant argued that he took out the gun to commit suicide and accidentally injured Chen Hairu unintentionally. He denied all accusations during the court's interrogation regarding inspecting ships, extorting donations and taxes, and eliminating our underground workers who were lurking on the water. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Boatman Wang Shouqing Does Not Admit to Doing Evil</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Suspected traitor Wang Shouqing was tried at the High Court yesterday afternoon. He is ostensibly a night-soil barge operator but is accused of serving as the chief of the Fifth Bao of the Fourth District of the Puppet Shanghai Waterways Security System, and later concurrently as a ship crewman for the enemy's 1629 Unit. In June of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], when the enemy army sealed ships, the defendant assigned Xu Likui's ship to transport artillery shells and military supplies to Wu [illegible] to aid Taiwan's defense. The ship was bombed by American aircraft, resulting in the death of crew member Bai Wentian and injuries to worker Lian Kaizha.

<h3>Bursting into Tears, Collapsing Before the Court, Repeatedly Crying for Justice, Continued Trial of a Major Murder Case in Qingpu, Witnesses Gu Nianlin and Others Tragically Narrate the Horrors, Two Defendants, One Evasive and One Feigning Ignorance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zou Baoxian, the puppet township chief of Xi'an Township, Qingpu County, who is accused of the brutal murder of fifteen people, and Xue Shunde, Chen Amu, Yang Ada, Yu Kesheng, and others, a total of five people, are on trial. Zou Baoxian and Chen Amu are in custody, while the others are still at large. The High Court continued the trial yesterday morning and summoned witnesses Gu Nianlin and Liu Xiaoerzi. Among the fifteen people killed, Huang Gu Nianlin's daughter, Huang Kaishan, and Zhou Zhenghong are Gu's two sons-in-law. Therefore, when Gu Nianlin testified in court yesterday morning, he was extremely grief-stricken. He entered the court and burst into tears, collapsing before the court president, repeatedly crying out for "Justice, Your Honor!" Gu is already 60 years old, with gray hair, wearing an old blue cloth jacket and broken rubber shoes. It is said that the murdered victims had their heads cut off and their bellies cut open, and were buried in two pits, one with nine bodies and the other with six. Zou Baoxian falsely accused the murdered victims of being bandits and sought a reward from Huang Liewen, the puppet county magistrate of Qingpu. Liu Xiaoerzi stated that in the first month of the lunar calendar in the 34th year of the Republic [1945], their small boat was docked near Laozhai River in Xiaoyin Township, Xi'an Township, in the Qingpu County area. While going ashore to collect grass, they had a quarrel with villagers Yang Ada and others and were subsequently surrounded and beaten. Liu Xiaoerzi was able to escape because he was small and unnoticed. He has not seen the other fifteen people since then. When questioned, defendant Zheng Shixian still claimed that they only knew about the villagers fighting with bandits at the time and remained evasive about other matters. Chen Amu kept shaking his head and asking irrelevant questions. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Provides Explanations Regarding Recent Accusations, Ding Guitang Receives Reporters, Claims That He Does Not Engage in Business, Self-Dealing, or Corruption, Has a Clear Conscience, and Is Not Afraid of Accusations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Ding Guitang, Deputy Chief Secretary of the Customs Administration, invited members of the Shanghai press yesterday afternoon at 4 PM for a private conversation to address recent accusations of collaboration with the enemy and other matters. Mr. Ding recounted his 30 years of service in the customs service, rising from a junior clerk to Deputy Inspector General of Customs. He claimed that he has always been loyal to the country, upright and straightforward, and has repeatedly fought with foreign customs officials for equal rights over the past 30 years, striving for national honor. Regarding the accusation made by a dismissed customs official named Shen, Mr. Ding explained that he remained in Shanghai and continued to work in the customs service for a year after the outbreak of the Pacific War under the orders of the Ministry of Finance to temporarily remain at his post. He believes that Shen's accusation is a malicious slander. After the victory, the Ministry of Finance established a review committee (of which he was not a member) specifically to review customs personnel in the recovered areas. The regulations stipulated that all senior officials who had served in the customs service in the occupied areas, except those who were indeed under enemy and puppet surveillance and unable to leave, would be dismissed. At that time, documents were found showing that Shen had colluded with the enemy and puppet regime while serving as the Customs Commissioner of the Guangzhou Customs, and he was immediately reported to the Ministry of Finance and dismissed and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office. He was later released due to insufficient evidence. After his release from prison, this person repeatedly demanded reinstatement and threatened to make accusations. He ignored him, and therefore, the malicious slander occurred. As for the various accusations listed in his indictment, Mr. Ding explained them one by one yesterday, calling them "nonsense," and claiming that he does not engage in business, self-dealing, or corruption. The residence he lives in and the car he drives are all owned by the customs service. "If I don't work for the customs service for one day, I won't have food to eat for one day." Therefore, he has a clear conscience and is not afraid of accusations. Finally, regarding the report in the newspapers on the 6th of this month about allegations of corruption in the warehouse takeover by the Enemy Property Administration, which implicated him, he stated that this matter not only had nothing to do with him but also had nothing to do with the Jianghai Customs. Therefore, he hopes that society and the press will take a serious stance. Criminals should be punished, but good people should not be embarrassed.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to Ding Guitang, Deputy Inspector General of Customs of the Customs Administration, the Jianghai Customs has seized approximately 10 billion yuan worth of smuggled goods over the past year through informants, with contraband such as cosmetics being the most common.</p>
<h3>Scope of Confiscation Defined for Enemy and Puppet Regime's Undelivered Postal Packages</h3>

However, within two months after the announcement, Koreans, Taiwanese, or Dalian residents may apply to the post office to claim the packages. If it is verified that there is no suspicion of collaboration with the enemy, the packages will be returned. (2) Postal packages sent by people from allied countries or friendly nations to Japanese people will be confiscated. (3) Postal packages sent between Chinese people, where the sender or recipient is a convicted traitor, will be confiscated.

<h3>American Steamship Arrives in Shanghai with Cargo</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The American Atlantic Navigation giant, the American Steamship Company, has established a branch in Shanghai. The company has over a hundred ships of 10,000 tons or more, with the largest reaching 40,000 to 50,000 tons. In the future, in addition to planning regular routes between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, it also plans to operate regular steamships between Shanghai and Australia once a month. The company also manages the American Pioneer Company and the Pacific Far East Line. Its first ship, the "Scorton," is scheduled to arrive in port today, carrying over 5,000 tons of war loan goods, including over 1,200 tons of relief supplies. The second ship, the "Red Coat," is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 16th of this month, carrying over 5,000 tons of goods and 52 passengers. The ships are scheduled to dock at the Riyun Port Wharf, and passengers will transfer to small company-prepared steamers to disembark at the New Customs Wharf.</p>
<h3>Lively Scene on Sinan Road, Another Thirty-Three Suspects Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The detailed implementation measures of the amnesty have not yet arrived in Shanghai. The District Prosecutor's Office continued to process the release on bail yesterday. A total of thirty-three suspects, who are considered relatively minor and certainly within the scope of the amnesty, were released, including three female prisoners. The detention center has released a total of 165 people in the past two days, most of whom are suspected of theft. There are currently approximately 2,000 inmates in the Sinan Road detention center, and it is estimated that over half of them will be eligible for amnesty. Currently, those released on bail are limited to those who have not been prosecuted and are likely to receive a decision not to prosecute. The news of the District Prosecutor's Office releasing prisoners has caused a lively scene at the junction of Sinan Road and Jianguo West Road for several days. The families of the detained defendants are all waiting in the nearby area to greet them. Three-wheeled vehicles and rickshaws, upon hearing the news, have also gathered from various places. As soon as the prison gates open, drivers compete to solicit business. [Another Report] Most of those detained in the detention center are small thieves. Yesterday, several people were approved for release on bail, but since they could not find guarantors, they had to be sent back to the detention center. When these people were being returned, they had smiles on their faces, as life after release would be problematic, and it would be better to be able to eat for free in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Our Military and Civilians Captured During the War and Sent Back from Australia Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the Pacific War, the Japanese army captured our military and civilians and sent them to islands near Australia to perform forced labor. The number of people was quite large. After the victory, it was ascertained that there were still over 1,200 of our military and civilians stranded on Yapur Island in Australia. After several consultations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British side, they finally boarded the Australian merchant ship "Chelena" at the end of last month and came to Shanghai. Over 800 civilians from Guangdong and Guangxi disembarked in Hong Kong to return to their hometowns. A Japanese war criminal, General Tanaka, was also taken into custody by the ship in Hong Kong. The remaining 356 people followed the ship and arrived at the Fourth Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong at 6:30 PM yesterday. 355 of them are our military officers and soldiers, and one is a civilian. Due to the late hour of arrival, they did not disembark from the ship yesterday and will disembark this morning. The Shanghai Garrison Command and other relevant agencies will send personnel to welcome them. The Shanghai Branch of the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will first distribute a cotton coat and a bag of flour to each person. The First Supply District Command has designated Jiangwan Conservatory of Music as the reception area.</p>
<h3>Supervise Those Who Sell and Manufacture Opium to Change Professions, Loans of Capital and Tools Will Be Provided for Relief</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Interior has drafted detailed implementation measures for handling opium addicts, rehabilitation, and post-rehabilitation relief affairs in the recovered areas. The main points are as follows: (1) The investigation, rehabilitation, inspection, compulsory rehabilitation, and follow-up verification of opium addicts will be carried out by the provincial and municipal governments along with their subordinate units. (2) Each province and city should establish special drug rehabilitation centers. The number and location of the centers will be determined by the Ministry of Interior in consultation with the Department of Health. The establishment of local drug rehabilitation centers and follow-up verification centers in each city and county will be supervised by the provincial and municipal governments along with their subordinate units. The necessary medicines and equipment will be applied for by the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration from UNRRA for early shipment to China. (3) Drug rehabilitation medications will be produced by the Department of Health, which may also authorize local health agencies to produce them. (4) Regarding the post-rehabilitation relief of opium addicts, after the opium fields are cleared of opium seedlings, the provincial and municipal governments will supervise the change to planting agricultural crops. For opium farmers who are unable to switch to other crops, loans of capital, seeds, etc., will be provided.

The necessary funds will be raised and allocated by the post-rehabilitation relief branch offices in each district. (6) For people who sell and manufacture opium, the provincial and municipal governments will supervise the change of profession.

<h3>Suspicion of Hidden Gold, Truth Can Be Revealed Immediately, Prosecutor Goes to Fuxing Island Again for Third On-Site Inspection</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The suspected hidden gold case on Fuxing Island is being jointly investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office, the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and the Garrison Command. The case has now developed to the final stage. According to relevant sources from the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration yesterday, the truth of the case has already been revealed. The informant's accusations of hidden gold and embezzlement, etc., are actually untrue. The inside story is that the informant fabricated facts and made malicious accusations due to other disputes, so he did not dare to sign his name on the informant's letter. Not long ago, the authorities directly obtained several suspected informants. After comparing their handwriting, new discoveries were made. Therefore, the case will be revealed soon. This morning, Gu Hongbiao, the prosecutor in charge of the District Prosecutor's Office, will once again go to Fuxing Island with Yu Lexing, a specialist commissioner from the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Xuan Dijie from the Garrison Command for a third on-site inspection.</p>

<h3>Quota Allocation Office of the Import Control Committee Explains Reasons for Slow Allocation; Registration and Approval of Importers Not Yet Completed; Number of Imported Goods Applied for is High and Inconsistent with Reality</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Gan, Director of the Quota Allocation Office of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Committee, stated when meeting with reporters yesterday: Our office is currently stepping up the calculation of quota allocations for several imported goods that require quota allocation by our office. However, due to the fact that the registration and approval of importers has not yet been completed, it is actually very difficult to make a comprehensive quota allocation for various imported goods. Furthermore, the amount of imported goods applied for by various import and export merchants is often unreasonable. For example, in the case of fuel alone, the amount applied for in one quarter has exceeded the total annual requirement. If such applications are approved, the country's foreign exchange resources will be greatly drained, and there is no such need domestically. Therefore, the outside world, not understanding the truth, often condemns our office for deliberately delaying the quota allocation, which is not knowing the true facts. However, our office is now quickly calculating the import quotas for several major imported goods, such as gasoline, diesel, timber, rubber, gum, and wool. Among these, gasoline is simple in nature because its import is concentrated in the hands of three or five large companies. The import quota for the first quarter of this year has also been determined to be 2.5 million US dollars. Within this value limit, each company can independently decide whether to ship gasoline in bulk or in drums. As for the allocation of this quota, except for a very small portion reserved for allocation to small companies, over 90% is delegated to the large companies for independent allocation. However, the companies ultimately believe that the allocation is uneven and still request that our office allocate it on their behalf. In the future, after the quotas for other imported goods are determined, it would be best if the import and export merchants could allocate them independently. Otherwise, our office will have to use the import amount reported by each import and export merchant in the three years before the war and one year after the war as a reference and make a reasonable allocation.</p>
<p>According to the Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Import Control Committee, over 4,000 import and export merchants in Shanghai have applied for registration with the Import Control Committee. The figures for other cities are not yet included. The committee is currently stepping up its review. Those who have been approved have been individually notified by the committee with a notification letter. However, the number of approved companies has not yet been finalized. The rumor of 300 companies is completely inaccurate. It is said that the committee will issue a public announcement after the approval is completed.</p>
<h3>Although the Central Bank Sells Gold, Gold Prices Rise Step by Step, Up 120,000 Compared to Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for [illegible] continued to be brisk. The Central Bank controlled the market many times. The morning opened at 3.56 million, and buyers were present. The price fluctuated around 3.57 million in the first session without any special changes. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank allocated 246 bars at a price of 3.58 million, and the demand from financial groups and importers became even greater, rebounding to over 3.6 million, with the high price reaching 3.65 million. The Central Bank still put pressure on the high price, and it once fell back to around 3.6 million. However, actual sales were still brisk due to the season, and at noon, it still stood at around 3.65 million. In the afternoon, overnight delivery once reached close to 3.7 million. The Central Bank still sold forcefully, and the low price once fell to 3.64 million. It ended at around 3.69 million, an increase of 120,000 compared to the previous close. Jewelry gold rose to 380,000. Silver dollars continued to rise. Underground money market was still even. Underground interest stood at around 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market was relatively stable. The underground market for US dollars opened in the morning at 6,250 yuan to 6,350 yuan, and at noon, it rebounded to a high price of 6,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold price rose sharply, and the situation was still stable. The result was an increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes also showed a slight upward trend. The result was an increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate rose slightly due to the decline in Shanghai telegraphic transfer rates, yesterday at around 1,140 yuan, with slight transactions. Indian exchange rate was 1,400 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 18,400 yuan. Both were still traded without a market. The official exchange rate for US dollars was still flat.</p>
<h3>Bulls Continuously Emerge, Government Bonds Gradually Fall Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, bulls continued to emerge in the government bond market. Offices such as 503 were selling heavily. Therefore, Tong Bing opened in the morning at 2,500 yuan and was immediately sold, gradually falling back to below 1,850 yuan, and then it stabilized slightly, hovering near the close. The result was a decline of 650 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi fell by 400 yuan, and Ding and Wu each fell by 500 yuan. The transaction volume was about 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Man-Made Silk Expected to Arrive, Market Price Increases Have Ceased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, because it was rumored that man-made silk would be arriving, price increases in the market ceased. It hovered throughout the day, and ultimately, the prices remained the same as the previous day. On the 30th, Guang Gaoshan opened at 3.37 million yuan, and Xu Zi traded at 3.35 million yuan. Later, there were real buyers who absorbed a few boxes, and then the price was increased by 230,000 yuan. At the close at noon, it was 3.4 million yuan. 120 Xu Zi semi-gloss was offered at 3.8 million yuan, but there were few transactions. Factory yarn was still stable, and trading was also very quiet. The asking price was similar to the previous day without any changes. Silk fabrics and quilt covers were particularly weak, and transactions were very rare. Because the raw material costs increased, Hua Jin crepe was offered at 3,600 yuan per yard, but buyers hesitated and watched, resulting in a lack of transactions.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Branches of Businesses Established with Finance Ministry Approval; Underground Establishments Evade Industry Associations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to prevent capital flight from Shanghai to Hong Kong, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Shanghai Silver Money Trade Association to instruct all businesses that had established branches in Hong Kong without authorization to close them down within five days of receiving the order and to report the handling situation to the Ministry. Those who disregarded the law would be severely punished. Our reporter inquired with the person in charge of the Silver Money Trade Association about this matter. According to him, the order was received at the end of last year. Although several banks had established branches in Hong Kong, they had all been approved by the Ministry of Finance before their establishment and there were no cases of unauthorized establishment. The Banking Association has already issued circulars to its members based on the Ministry of Finance's order. Shen Rixin of the money exchange business said that, to his knowledge, no money exchanges had established branches in Hong Kong. If they changed their names and established money exchanges in Hong Kong without using the name "branch," they would not need to be approved by the Ministry of Finance and there would be no way to investigate their inner workings. Furthermore, the interest rates in Hong Kong's businesses are currently very low. Some British banks do not even pay interest on deposits, and the interest rate for ordinary banks is approximately one or two percent for deposits and only six percent for loans. Therefore, Shanghai businesses moving to Hong Kong can only maintain their original capital. Unless they have strong financial resources and other plans, there is no need for this. The Money Exchange Association has now issued circulars to its members, but there have been no reports of illegal branches being closed and reported.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Increasingly Sluggish; Only 32-Count Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market became increasingly sluggish. From the opening of the market, it was enveloped in a selling atmosphere. Operators rushed to sell, and 20-count yarn fell by another 30,000 to 50,000. Gu Lu customer sales were also weak and transactions were very few. Only 32-count remained stable as before, because textile factories and the Guangdong groups were still adding to their purchases.</p>
<h3>Simplified Forms for Factory Loan Applications Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The tenth regular meeting of the Provisional Examination Committee for Production Business Loans of the Four Joint Offices was held in the conference room of the Bank of China Building yesterday afternoon. The meeting was chaired by Huo Yamin, the chairman of the committee, and attended by standing committee members Li Fuxun, Xu Jili, Qin Runqing, Lin Fengbao, and experts, totaling more than 20 people. The meeting adjourned at about 3:00 PM, having approved more than ten loan applications, totaling about 4 billion yuan. In order to facilitate the completion of application forms for factories applying for loans of less than 100 million yuan, the committee has approved the simplification of the forms to be submitted by approved factories. Details can be inquired at the committee's information office, Room 218, Second Floor, Bank of China. It is also heard that the committee is handling production business loans quickly due to their urgent nature. Ordinary cases can be loaned out one week after receiving the documents. More complex cases can be loaned out within ten days after receiving the documents. However, it is best for applicants with larger loan amounts to apply for review and transfer through their usual banks, which will be even faster.</p>
<h3>Rice Supply Decreases; Both Northern and Southern Japonica Rice Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>The supply of rice decreased, with only about 5,000 stones arriving from both the north and south. Demand revived, and the prices of both northern and southern Japonica rice rose again by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Common rice was still scarce, and Baiyinyuan rice also rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. The supply of vegetable oil on the oil market was still strong, and demand was also brisk. After an initial decline, prices recovered strongly, eventually rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil was scarce and remained firm. Sesame oil prices fluctuated. Demand for soybean cake in Shantou and Xiamen was not strong, and prices fell by a small amount of 100 yuan. Flour mills continued production as usual, and the supply was available. People were calm, and market prices were nominally fixed but actually soft. Bran from inland areas was firm and expensive, with very active rural demand, rising by 300 to 500 yuan. Sesame sales in Guangdong were light and prices fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. However, black sesame sales were active within the year and prices were still firm. Raw peanuts remained unchanged for the time being. Cowpeas were sold as soon as they arrived and prices were stable. The supply of wheat could not keep up with sales and remained firm. The sales of mung beans to Southeast Asia continued and the market was strong, rising another 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Broad beans fell by 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories showed slight interest, and local demand was also strong, rebounding by 500 to 1,000 yuan. The supply and demand for corn were balanced and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn and Cloth Sold to Hong Kong; Domestic Goods Transported Southward Impacted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the victory, Southeast Asia had a strong demand for Chinese cotton cloth. However, production was insufficient, so it was temporarily impossible to supply it. Even though the Fujian and Guangdong provinces in South China had transported it in batches, smuggling was still rampant. Recently, Japanese yarn has begun to be transported to Hong Kong, and the price is cheaper than Chinese yarn. According to the transportation industry in this city, cotton yarn was smuggled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in the past. Now that Japanese yarn is being transported to Hong Kong, it is feared that Hong Kong's cotton yarn will be smuggled to Guangzhou. Also, because Japanese yarn is cheap, Southeast Asian ports such as Singapore and Java, which used to sell Chinese cloth, may be unable to supply it in the future and may be taken over by Japanese cotton cloth. The future of China's Southeast Asian market is quite bleak.</p>
<p>Another report: The Taikoo Steamship Company's Fujian wheel will sail from Shanghai to Kobe on the 16th of this month, carrying a large batch of cotton yarn to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Book Industry Representatives from Beijing and Shanghai Appeal for Cultural Crisis; Journalists Entertained in the Capital Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing 8th Telegram] The book industry associations from Beijing and Shanghai entertained the press at 3:00 PM on the 8th, including Liu Jikang, Yao Pengzi, Xu Qitang, Xu Xiaoyun, Lu Shizhong, Wang Fenggu, Xu Boxin, and Huang Zhongkang, representatives from Shanghai who came to Beijing to petition, and more than ten reporters. Yao Pengzi first reported on the situation of the Shanghai publishing industry during the occupation and after the victory, saying that the impact of the current political situation, the cost of printing materials has doubled, and the market and purchasing power have decreased, and a major crisis is imminent.</p>
<p>Publishing Institutions Open and Close Randomly</p>
<p>Newly established publishing institutions open and close randomly. Of the 36 who returned from the rear, 10 have been shut down. The publishing industry is different from other industries. Its finished products cannot be rashly increased in price or mortgaged for loans. The sales of finished products are also affected by transportation and timeliness. It is difficult to turnover capital. Last time, they came to Beijing to petition, requesting the government to exempt business tax in order to support culture, but there was no result, so they came to Beijing again to jointly petition with their Beijing counterparts. However, according to unofficial news, textbooks can be completely exempted from business tax, while other books will be taxed at half the rate. Publishing institutions that run textbooks and do not run textbooks are dissatisfied with this. On the one hand, the country's culture cannot be developed solely by relying on textbooks. On the other hand, newspapers can be completely tax-free, and the book industry, which also contributes to culture, should be treated the same.</p>
<p>Efforts to Improve Book Postage</p>
<p>On the 7th, they went to the Direct Taxation Department and the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Communications. In addition to Minister Wang Yunwu expressing his sympathy and promising to convey his opinions, Deputy Minister Ling Hongxun of the Ministry of Communications also accepted considerations. The representatives put forward a request to abolish the small package postage method for books promulgated during the war, and immediately invited the responsible personnel of the General Post Office to make inquiries, promising to strive to improve the book postage method in the future within a reasonable range. As for taxation, because the Ministry of Finance is busy dealing with the review of the budget by the Senate, there is no result yet. The representatives will go to the Ministry of Finance again on the afternoon of the 8th to petition, hoping that the media can lend their support and jointly maintain the country's cultural lifeline.</p>
<p>Half-Exemption News Declared Inaccurate</p>
<p>After Yao Ci and Xu Qitang added briefly, Xu Boxin, the petition representative who had just returned from the Ministry of Finance, reported that Vice Minister Li of the Ministry of Finance had two points: First, Li denied that the Central News Agency's report on the full or half exemption of business tax for the book industry was officially released. The Direct Taxation Department has not yet issued this announcement. The Ministry of Finance is still studying and considering this matter and will make a decision as soon as possible. Second, Li affirmed that the "book industry" and the "newspaper industry" are both cultural undertakings, without any doubt.</p>
<p>The Response from the Ministry of Finance is Quite Good</p>
<p>Then Wang Fenggu supplemented the explanation that textbooks and reference books are both necessary in formal education and self-study education and cannot be arbitrarily increased in price. He also stated the embarrassing situation of the book industry's inability to compensate for losses. Vice Minister Li's response was quite good, but he still hoped for media assistance to complete the purpose of the petition. Then the reporters asked questions about printing costs and book sales, and everyone had a feeling of laughing and crying. Xu Boxin also told reporters yesterday that the various bookstores are now busy dealing with the year-end. The representatives from Shanghai are scheduled to return to Shanghai by night train on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Education Bureaus in Various Counties of Guizhou to be Restored Next Month</h3>

<h3>Student Unrest at Jianghuai Middle School Leads to Movement to Expel President Wang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Bengbu 8th Telegram] Wang Ziyi, the president of Jianghuai Jia School, is corrupt and domineering, arousing public indignation among alumni and launching a movement to protect the school and expel Wang, requesting the competent authority to dismiss him and elect a capable president.

<h3>Representatives of Municipal Elementary School Principals Association Petitioned the Education Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting Announcement of New Salary Standards for Teachers and Staff</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] More than 30 representatives from the Municipal Elementary School Principals Association, including Hu Huaitian and Ling Qishen, went to the Municipal Education Bureau to petition yesterday (8th) at 10:00 AM, requesting the prompt announcement of the new salary standards for elementary school teachers and staff and the monthly salary to be issued earlier at the beginning of the month.

<h3>Ji Weihao Appointed as New Principal of Qingnian Elementary School</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Qingnian Elementary School affiliated with the Qingnian Middle School on Linsen Middle Road in this city held a school affairs meeting yesterday (8th), presided over by Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the school board. In addition to giving instructions on future school affairs, the original principal, Jiang Yuxuan, resigned due to other high positions. It was resolved to appoint Ji Weihao, a school board member, as the principal. The school is well managed, and Ji, who was originally the principal of Qingnian Middle School and has rich academic experience, will definitely have greater development under the leadership of Li in the future.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Middle School Teachers and Staff Association Sends Letter Requesting Emergency Loans from the Council</h3>
<p>The Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Association held a board meeting at Yucai Middle School at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and made many important decisions. Regarding the request for assistance from the Municipal Council, the following two opinions were unanimously agreed upon and sent to the Municipal Council in a letter: (1) To improve the lives of teachers, it is still hoped that students will contribute assistance. The name can be set as the Teacher Welfare Fund, and the amount is requested to be determined by the Council. It has been found that the treatment of municipal middle school teachers this semester is only half that of private schools. Fortunately, the Respect for Teachers Fund has slightly supplemented it, and the public sentiment has been slightly calmed. If the facts are ignored in the next semester and the Council ignores and disregards the Association's recommendations, then the municipal school teachers will flock to private schools or switch to other industries, and the Shanghai municipal middle school frontline will be on the verge of collapse; (2) To issue winter clothing subsidies, it is proposed that the government immediately raise funds. The members of the Association previously requested the government to issue a winter clothing subsidy of 500,000 yuan because of the cold weather and the need to add cotton clothing. The mayor stated that if there is a precedent to follow, the municipal government will do its best to allocate it. It has been found that "the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration issued winter clothing expenses of 1 million yuan per person, and the Central Party Department Secretariat and the Supreme National Defense Council issued winter clothing expenses of 500,000 yuan per person," etc., and the news has been widely broadcast, and the facts are ironclad. It is not excessive for the middle school colleagues to request an emergency loan of 500,000 yuan, which can be drawn from the general reserve fund. Once the Council makes a decision, the municipal government can announce it. This is a government special relief that must be provided according to law, reason, and precedent, so as to get through the New Year.</p>

<h3>The City Education Bureau Will Begin Issuing Elementary School Teacher Qualification Certificates Tomorrow; Schools Must Verify Qualification Certificates Before Employing Teachers Next Semester</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has completed the writing of qualification certificates for national school teachers. Qualified teachers should go to the bureau on the following specified dates, according to their receipt number, to collect their certificates. A printing fee of 500 yuan must be paid. Those who have lost their receipts must have a letter of proof from their serving school, with a photo attached and the number noted. If the number is forgotten, inquire with the bureau and report it as soon as possible for collection: January 10th for numbers 1 to 2000, January 11th for numbers 2001 to 4000, January 12th for numbers 4001 to 6000, January 14th for numbers 6001 to 8000, January 15th for numbers 8001 to 10000.</p>
<p>Another report: Among the 10,000 teachers in public and private elementary schools in this city, those teaching part-time account for slightly more than one-tenth. According to the Education Bureau, over 8,000 teachers have been issued qualification certificates this time, which is sufficient for the employment of teachers in public and private elementary schools throughout the city. Starting next semester, schools must first verify whether teachers have qualification certificates before employing them. Those without certificates will not be allowed to be employed arbitrarily.</p>

<h3>British Expert Mr. Patrick Arrives in China to Promote Sino-British Cultural Exchange</h3>
<p>[Our News] Mr. Trelake, newly appointed as a consultant for the English Studies Department of the British Council, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from England and took a train to Beijing in the evening. The main task of Mr. Trelake's visit is to investigate the general situation of English studies in our country so that the British Council can maximize its efforts. The council has established a detailed plan to subsidize universities and normal schools in terms of economy and materials to engage in English research. In recent years, advanced countries have adopted film education as a tool to educate the general public. The council will also widely adopt it for English education to promote cultural exchange between China and Britain. The two countries have a long history of several decades in the study of each other's language and literature. Mr. Trelake's visit will further strive to promote friendly relations between the two countries. Mr. Trelake was born in China and returned to England at the age of six. He studied English at the University of London for many years and taught at Columbia University and Yale University. After the outbreak of the European War, he once wanted to serve in China with the army, so this is his third visit to our country.</p>
<h3>College Basketball Game: Tongji Meets Datong Today, Hujiang Faces Daxia in the Women's Group</h3>
<p>The college basketball league will hold a total of three games for men and women starting at 3:00 PM today at the City Gymnasium. Admission is free and visitors are welcome.</p>
<p>The first game, the college group, starts at 3:00 PM, with Gongzhuan facing the China Journalism College. Followed by the women's group at 4:00 PM, Hujiang faces Daxia. The last game, the school group, Tongji meets Datong. Datong narrowly defeated Jiaotong by 49 to 47 in the first game, but due to a player who was a part-time worker and a dropout, they automatically declared their defeat to Jiaotong. Today, they will be extra cautious against Tongji. The school's players are not short of famous players. If the team's Lin Weicong, Ren Yu Xu Shen, etc., have experienced many battles and have rich experience, it should not be difficult to solve the problem at that time. However, Tongji is known as a "dark horse" among the university teams. Although Datong can win, it will undoubtedly pay a considerable price, and there will definitely be many wonderful moments. Today's order of events is recorded below: Gongzhuan - Zhongxin (College) 3:00 PM, Hujiang - Daxia (Women's Group) 4:00 PM, Tongji - Datong (School Group) 5:00 PM.</p>

After the start, Feishuo's Hong Dequan won the first game 15 to 10 with fierce smashes. In the second game, Tiyun's two players fell into a slump, and Feishuo won again 15 to 0. In the last game, Tiyun resisted hard, but still could not resist the opponent's fierce attack, and lost to Feishuo again by 12 to 15.</p>
<p>In the second doubles group, Feishuo's Ni Zhengyi and Cai Shiwen met Tiyun's Pei Sigan and Aisikai. Feishuo's Ni and Cai were skilled and well-coordinated, and defeated Pei and Ai in three straight sets 15 to 9, 15 to 8, and 15 to 2.</p>
<p>In the third group, Feishuo was composed of Wu Chonggong and Wang Zhongcheng against Tiyun's Hai Xuny ou and Qiao Qinsen. After the start of the game, Tiyun tried to avenge their shame and attacked fiercely. Feishuo could not resist and lost the first game to Tiyun by 13 to 15. In the second game, Feishuo saw the opponent's weakness and, under a concerted attack, won back a game by 15 to 12, tying the score. In the last game, Feishuo attacked with all their strength, and Tiyun resisted fiercely. Feishuo narrowly won the third game by 15 to 14. The overall result was 8 to 1.</p>
<p>Results from the previous day:</p>
<p>Tiyun defeated Liangyou (B Group) 7-2</p>

<h3>Small Ball Performance at the Stadium: Longjie vs. Yiqiao This Weekend, Another Match: Qigui vs. Jianhua</h3>
<p>The City Stadium originally planned to hold a soccer performance on the National Revival Festival last year, with a match between Railway and Yiqiao. However, it was blocked due to rain at that time. In order to make up for this soccer game, it is scheduled to be changed to a small soccer performance starting at 2:00 PM this weekend, with Qigui vs. Jianhua, and Longjie vs. Yiqiao, a total of two games.</p>

<p>Civil Affairs Briefing</p>
<h3>National Identity Cards are Exempt from Stamp Duty; The Ministry of Interior Notifies the City Government by Telegram</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved a telegram from the Ministry of Interior, which stated that "previously, the Henan Provincial Government requested the issuance of national identity cards, with stamp duty of 50 yuan affixed in accordance with regulations. The Ministry considers that the national identity cards issued by local governments at all levels in accordance with the Household Registration Law and its Implementation Rules, and other household registration certificates, are all a type of various certificate forms attached to the rules. Judging from their nature, they are the same as the 'household registration certificates' listed in item 23 of the stamp duty law's tax rate table, which are exempt from stamp duty. Furthermore, the national identity cards are intended to be issued universally, and stipulating the collection of costs is already difficult for the country. If we are to order the payment of stamp duty again, I am afraid that the majority of the people will not be able to afford it, which will hinder the implementation of household administration. After requesting the Ministry of Finance to review the matter, the Ministry of Finance approved a public letter stating that national identity cards are certificates for handling household registration, and in accordance with the provisions of item 23 of the stamp duty law's tax rate table, which exempts household registration certificates from stamp duty, they can be exempted from stamp duty. Accordingly, please check" The City Government has issued a notice to all district offices yesterday to comply.</p>

<h3>The Holding of the National Games and Shanghai's Preparation</h3>
<p>Whether or not the 7th National Games will be held has been widely reported in the newspapers of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin two months ago, and all contained encouraging messages. Finally, the Ministry of Education issued a side news saying that the National Games will be held in the capital on the Double Tenth Festival next year (that is, this year). Thus, the speculation about the date and location of the National Games came to an end, and the Jingxing government made a clear announcement, but there has been no further news to date. Many enthusiastic friends are vying to ask what is going on, but</p>
<p>Perhaps the government is busy with major political events and has no time for this; or the political situation is not yet completely stable and there are concerns; or there are difficulties in funding; we do not know the exact reason. If it is shelved for the above reasons, I think it is not a reason. The preparation of the Games is handled by technical personnel, which does not conflict with political activities; the participating units of the Games are provinces, cities and special regions, and there is no problem between the provinces, cities and the central government, and it can be guaranteed that 100% of the teams will attend. Even if there are some difficulties in transportation, it is not impossible to solve, and perhaps there will be no difficulties at all in ten months; as for the funds, including the construction of the stadium, it will only cost more than 10 billion yuan, which will definitely not make the finance overwhelmed.</p>
<p>In the year since the restoration, other departments have made considerable achievements, but only sports are still at a loss. We dare not say that the government is unwilling to devote itself to promoting it, but at least dare to say that it has not given the endangered sports a shot in the arm. The National Games can indeed be regarded as a shot in the arm. The sports of all parts of the country are hoping to be activated under this shot, but this shot is held in the hand and is unwilling to be injected. We are anxious, anxious for the endangered sports.</p>
<p>From the perspective of sports administration, the Games are a means, not an end. As long as the government clearly announces that the National Games will be held in the capital on the Double Tenth Festival this year, it is also giving a shot in the arm to the endangered national sports. National sports will be revitalized. What's more, it is not impossible to actually hold it? Time is faster than an airplane, right? The Double Tenth Festival is coming in the blink of an eye. We hope that the government will make a decision, immediately inject the prepared shot in the arm into the sick mouth of sports, and then inject the shot in the arm held in the hand into the sick body of sports.</p>
<p>Shanghai was the host of the previous National Games and also the winner of the previous National Games overall championship. Shanghai sports has never been willing to fall behind. Regardless of whether the National Games can be held on the Double Tenth Festival this year, the Shanghai sports community must prepare to maintain our past glory. The work of preparation naturally needs to be done in different categories, but there should be a comprehensive plan. The entire plan should be formulated by the National Sports Committee of the Education Bureau and the Council of the Sports Association, and the technical problems of each discipline should be handled by expanding the organization based on the committees of the City Sports Association.</p>
<p>What I hope for the preparation work is not like in the past, selecting some outstanding talents a few weeks before the Games, and putting them together. But from now on, pay attention to finding promising talents, and assign responsible instructors to use various methods to test them, and finally organize and train them. If this is not done, not only will new talents be buried, but also from the perspective of the team, we can only get five, nine or eleven good players, but we cannot get a good team.</p>
<p>Shanghai has many enthusiastic sports enthusiasts, experienced instructors, and countless new and old sports talents. If the competent sports administrative agency and sports organizations can cooperate and preside over it, excellent results can be obtained to await the arrival of the National Games. Otherwise, it can also cope with inter-port challenges or expeditions to other cities, and reap the benefits of improving the level of sports. (Wei)</p>

<h3>Zhangjiakou is Under Reconstruction</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou, nearly three months after its restoration, is still in a state of semi-alert. The city is full of bunkers, and iron nets are visible everywhere along the way. After 9 pm, the entire city enters a state of martial law. There is not a single pedestrian on the road, only soldiers wearing leather hats and coats, carrying guns and ammunition, guarding in the severe cold of nearly minus ten degrees. Under the half-lit lights, dragging a long shadow, they appear particularly nervous. The Beijing-Shanghai reporters group once had the following joke in Zhangyuan due to martial law.</p>
<h3>A Photo Becomes a Temporary Pass</h3>
<p>It was the evening of December 30th. The reporters group took a small car – perhaps the commander's own car – and left the commander's office after bidding farewell. Under the host's warm hospitality, everyone drank some of the famous wines from outside the Great Wall. On the car, they talked about the tragic situation they saw in Chongli during the day. After the car passed Qinghe Bridge, the streets became narrower and narrower, and the driving gradually slowed down. Just as they were about to make the last turn, the soldier next to the bunker suddenly stopped the car and asked for the password. This stumped the reporters. The only hope was that the driver might know, but unexpectedly, this person was in a hurry to leave and did not pay attention to it in advance. Although the reporters repeatedly explained that they were the Beijing-Shanghai reporters group who came out of the commander's office, the soldiers still refused to let them go because they were executing orders. This standoff lasted for two minutes. Finally, thanks to the quick wit of one of the colleagues, who showed the soldier a large photo of Commander Fu with his autograph that he had given to each of us, they were able to pass smoothly. Afterwards, everyone laughed and said, "I didn't expect Commander Fu's photo to be used as a temporary pass!" The reason why the reporter mentioned this story is just to illustrate that although the entire province of Cai has been recovered, the security authorities have to take precautions against the "scattered Communist troops" everywhere. Even Commander Chuan himself admitted that "the two provinces of Cai and Sui cannot be said to be unthreatened." This unstable situation, of course, has a significant impact on the revival of Zhangyuan and even the entire Cai province. A staff member of a certain bank who is engaged in relief work in Zhangyuan specifically emphasized this point. The reporter and Zhang Ziwen also learned from a reliable source that on the evening of December 29, a sabotage conspiracy was discovered in Zhangyuan, but fortunately it was discovered in advance and suppressed.</p>
<p>Unable to Distinguish Commanders from Soldiers</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the entire territory of Caiha has not been completely stabilized, and despite the fact that Zhangjiakou is still under some large or small threats, all of this cannot prevent the provincial authorities from making efforts to revitalize. In conversations with a dozen people who entered Zhang with the army, they almost unanimously praised the rapid revival of Zhangyuan in the period of less than three months. A car driver told the reporter that when the National Army first entered Zhangyuan, landmines were buried everywhere in the city, especially along the highways and factories. Now the mine-sweeping work has been completed. Initially, all the electric lights in the city were destroyed, but now, relying on an aging and dilapidated 10,000-watt machine, the city can see light again at night, and the wheels of the flour mill have begun to turn out bags of mixed flour.</p>
<p>Those who are promoting these works are all people who are devoted to their work and do not seek fame. Some of them are noble chairmen and directors, and some have studied abroad, but they only wear two kinds of uniforms: one is a grass-yellow cotton military uniform, with a leather hat with upturned sides, which looks like a junior officer from a distance; the other is a black cotton uniform (rarely woolen). Because their clothing is so simple, they are often mistaken by reporters. Zhou Jun, the mayor of Zhangjiakou, did not attract attention when he greeted reporters at the airport because he wore "coarse cloth clothes". Bai Baozhang, the director of the Finance Department of Cai Province, also told reporters that when he accompanied Commander Chuan to the capital last time, he was afraid that his black cotton uniform would be unsightly, so he rushed to make some new clothes.</p>
<p>The treatment of general civil servants is very poor, especially those transferred from Huanyuan, who are only given a subsidy of 30,000 yuan per person. They work in the situation of lack of money and people. After the opening of the Pinghuan Road, the prices in Zhangjiakou have almost caught up with those in Pingjin, but in this adjustment of civil servant treatment, Pingjin, Beijing and Shanghai are listed as the first level, while Zhangjiakou is the third level, the same as Lansui, which is too unfair. Director Bai and others hope that the reporters can appeal on their behalf. But they explained that at this time when the national economic situation is difficult, it is right for civil servants to suffer temporarily, as long as the work they do is beneficial to the country and the nation, they are willing to have less money. These words are enough to represent the meaning of the majority of civil servants in Cai Province, and the revival of the entire Zhangjiakou and even Cai Province is built on this firm will.</p>
<h3>Rising from the Ruins</h3>
<p>As a reporter who grew up in Shanghai and has traveled extensively throughout the northwestern and southwestern provinces since the Anti-Japanese War, I have seen many major cities in the rear. However, few can compare to Zhangjiakou in terms of the sheer number of smokestacks. The Chinese and foreign reporters traveling with me this time were also unanimously astonished by Zhangjiakou's solid industrial foundation. The pity is that the destruction was so severe. On the way from the airfield to the city, we passed countless broken walls and ruins, as if we were walking through the Jiangwan area of Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to reliable investigations, there are a total of seventy-seven industrial and electrical institutions in Chahar Province. Ten are factories, nine are semi-factories, and fifty-eight are small-scale and still operate as side businesses. Forty of these are located in Zhangjiakou, and almost all forty were completely destroyed. It is no wonder that Chief Fu said with deep sorrow: "Destruction is easy, but construction is difficult. The destruction that the Communist Party accomplished in one night or half a day, we have yet to fully recover from."</p>
<p>Having said that, after nearly three months of effort, the debris has been cleared, the smokestacks have been erected, and the wheels of some factories have begun to turn again. According to the investigation, out of the above-mentioned seventy-seven units, fifty-four have been reorganized, and twenty-three are in the process of being reorganized. Among them, nineteen can resume work as soon as the electricity supply is no longer a problem. Seventeen cannot be restored at all, and for the rest to resume work, the buildings and machinery must be extensively repaired. In addition, the authorities have also rushed to transport and collect 600 tons of machinery and equipment (mostly incomplete) from the area bordering the Communist army. More than 100 tons have already been transported back, and the rest is being rushed back.</p>
<p>The Most Serious Electricity Problem</p>
<p>People in Beijing and Shanghai who curse the electricity company for a one or two-minute power outage cannot imagine the severity of the electricity shortage in Zhangjiakou. Zhangjiakou was not without electricity before. During the Japanese occupation, there were plans to establish a 65,000-kilowatt power supply network in Chahar, of which 40,000 kilowatts had been completed. The most famous was the Xiahuayuan Power Plant (where the Japanese built a 20,000-kilowatt generator). However, after three destructions, Zhangjiakou had less than 1,000 kilowatts of electricity left. Because the wheels of the factory cannot turn without electricity, tens of thousands of workers are unemployed. Because there is no electricity, the millstones of the flour mill cannot be turned, and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of ordinary people are affected. During the reporter's short stay in Zhangjiakou, we visited the only remaining power plant for half an hour.</p>
<p>According to Section Chief Zhang, the machines used in the plant were already discarded by the Japanese. After the restoration, they were found again and repaired. The smokestacks were moved from elsewhere. Because it is an old and broken machine, it can only generate 312 kilowatts, which of course cannot bear the entire power supply task. To this day, not many businesses in Zhangjiakou use electricity. This veteran of the electricity industry led us to see the boiler and pointed to the coal in the warehouse and said to us: "Although the boiler is a product of Westinghouse, it is already old. And the coal, you see, turns into slag as soon as it is burned and must be washed very often. We start the furnace at 5 pm every day, rest at 12 pm to clean the furnace, and start again at 1 am and burn until 5 am. Then we start again at 8 am and burn until 3 pm, so that both homes and factories have electricity, especially the flour mill. Flour is too important. How can the people live without flour!"</p>
<p>He told us that Datong may have two broken 3,000-kilowatt machines that can be moved here, and they can be started with another 60 to 70 million yuan. The National Resources Commission may also move a 500-kilowatt machine here. When all of them are started, there will be 3,000 kilowatts. If so, it will not be difficult for match factories, cigarette factories, etc. to gradually resume work. The Xiahuayuan Power Plant has been taken over by the National Resources Commission. You Lingyun and all the staff sent by the commission arrived on the 20th of last month. The first step is to check the damage, and once completed, they can begin repairs and replacements. Because the damage is not too severe, it is hoped that the old appearance can be restored in two or three months. At that time, the power generation will reach 10,000 kilowatts, which can be supplied to Xuanhua and other places in addition to Xiahuayuan and Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>Equally important as electricity is coal. After entering winter, the climate in Zhangjiakou is always below ten degrees Celsius. A reporter's ink bottle hidden in the box also cracked due to the cold. The beards of the elderly on the street were covered with ice beads. It is impossible to keep warm without coal. The largest coal mine near Zhangjiakou is the Baoxing Coal Mine. Chief Fu recently allocated 30 million yuan in working capital to help rebuild it. The mine has more than 1,000 workers, and their work enthusiasm is extremely high. Each load of coal is enough for 400 catties. Many farmers also use their slack farming time to mine coal as a side business. Currently, 300 tons of bituminous coal and anthracite coal can be produced every day. If the electricity in Xiahuayuan is restored, and all four pits produce coal, the output can be increased to more than 400 tons. The mine also generates its own electricity and has installed more than 200 lights, the brightness of which can be compared with that of Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>The provincial government recently sent personnel to Xiahuayuan to inspect the mining affairs and business of various mines to prepare for increased production. Certain effective measures will also be taken for mine safety, so the coal shortage problem in Zhangjiakou and other places will soon be resolved.</p>
<h3>The Major Artery Beats Again</h3>
<p>The PingSui Railway, designed and funded by the Chinese themselves, has recently been fully opened to traffic again. This is very important for the revitalization of Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>The rush repair work on the Zhangjiakou section of the PingSui Railway was completed on December 12th. On that day, the east and west rush repair teams connected the rails in Luowenzao, and the work of opening the entire PingSui Railway was completed. Since the 21st of last month, there have been two trains each day between Zhangjiakou, traveling back and forth once, which has greatly facilitated passenger transport.</p>
<p>The PingSui Railway suffered considerable war damage. The railway once conducted a general investigation of this, and turning over the loss list now is still shocking and makes one's hands tremble. The reporters went to the railway station to visit. The station was full of lime for repairing the houses, and several red and green track-pressing cars were parked on the rails. The offices were empty, and the scene was desolate enough. After asking around three or five times, we found a Deputy Station Master Chen on duty, who was also busy making phone calls. Four or five merchants were standing next to him. The room was not big enough, and the addition of four or five reporters made it even narrower.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, we loaded seven cars of leather and grain. I'm afraid there will be more today. The customers are urging us very urgently. You have to find a way..." The Deputy Station Master shouted into the phone. The customers standing next to him looked at him with anxious eyes. The phone call lasted for three full minutes, during which several more customers came in. Finally, the Deputy Station Master saw that we had been waiting for too long and asked us to sit down. The first thing he said was: "I'm really too busy. I'm very sorry to have kept you waiting."</p>
<p>According to him, Zhangjiakou has a considerable backlog of goods, and customers are urging them very closely. Because there are no train cars available, the goods cannot be shipped out for three or four days. The main items shipped from Zhangjiakou to Beiping are white flour, millet, yellow rice, pork, and other items. Recently, the Chief Headquarters verbally notified that large-scale exports of grain and meat are prohibited, but small quantities are still being shipped out, about three or four train cars per day. The items shipped from Beiping are mainly cloth, sundries, and machinery parts, and the quantity cannot be estimated.</p>
<p>On the western section, although it has been opened to traffic, no trains run at night for safety reasons, and there are not many passenger transports. The main items loaded from the Datong area are food and coal, and most of the coal is produced in Kouquan.</p>
<p>The main difficulties at present are the lack of locomotives and train cars. The bridges along the line are all temporarily repaired and must be greatly repaired in the spring. Because of the lack of water and the poor quality of the coal, trains are often delayed by one or two hours, sometimes even by a day. In the past, trains could travel at 60 or 70 li per hour, but now they can only travel at 20 or 30 li per hour at the fastest, and only 10 li per hour at the worst, which is almost as fast as walking. After the PingSui Railway was opened to traffic, it had both good and bad effects on Zhangjiakou. On the good side, the materials between Zhangjiakou and Jin, Sui, and Ji provinces are connected through this railway. On the bad side, the prices in Zhangjiakou are gradually leveling with those in Pingjin, and the people feel the heavy pressure of life. The fur in Zhangjiakou was originally quite cheap. After the opening of the railway, because many people from Pingjin came to Zhangjiakou to purchase goods, the price increased. The famous grapes used to sell for only 200 yuan per catty, but now they have risen to more than 1,000 yuan per catty. In addition, after the PingSui Railway was opened to traffic, it also transported some American cigarettes and other things, but fortunately, the quantity is not too large.</p>
<p>In addition to the railway, the highways near Zhangjiakou have also been completely repaired. The Longguan-Chicheng highway, which was recently repaired, had a test drive on December 27th, and the results were good.</p>
<p>Current Status of the Fur Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Based on the reporter's observation in Zhangjiakou for two days, although the commercial situation in Zhangjiakou is quite sluggish, it is generally stable. At the very least, a crisis like the one in the industry and commerce of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin will not occur by the end of the Gregorian calendar or the end of the lunar calendar. Regarding this point, the reporter asked the locals, and their explanation was: Zhangjiakou has not been recovered for three full months, and everything is still in the process of repatriation. The only thing that is felt lacking is insufficient funds, and there are no other serious problems.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, the reporters paid considerable attention to the fur industry in Zhangjiakou. On the day of departure, we went to several of the largest fur stores to take a look.</p>
<p>According to people familiar with the industry: The fur business has been quite good in the past half month. In addition to the retail sales of fur coats and robes, because the weather is getting colder, and food carts from outside the port are entering the country, farmers and vendors running outside the port are buying fur trousers and fur coats, so fur is generally more liquid. The price of coarse fur is about 120,000 yuan for large pieces and about 100,000 yuan for small pieces. As for raw fur and various types of hair, because merchants from Tianjin do not come to purchase them, they are still quite sluggish.</p>
<p>In addition to the fur industry, the main export products of Zhangjiakou include food, medicinal materials, and other items. Recently, because farmers inside and outside the port came to Zhangjiakou to sell grain, the amount of grain on the market has increased from more than 1,000 shi to 1,100 shi per day. The main miscellaneous grains such as wheat, millet, corn, and sorghum have fallen by 500 to 1,000 yuan per shi. Grain merchants from Beiping and eastern Chahar, due to transportation difficulties, no longer greedily purchase, and supply exceeds demand, and grain prices have fallen accordingly, especially oil grains such as sesame seeds and rapeseed, with the price falling from 43,000 to 44,000 yuan per shi to 35,000 to 36,000 yuan, a difference of as much as 10,000 yuan. Wheat sales are still smooth, and the price remains at 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou is a distribution center for goods and does not have much consumption itself. When goods arrive, they are often crowded, which easily leads to price drops. Recently, foreign goods such as kerosene and cigarettes have fallen in price due to excessive imports, and some are even cheaper than those in Pingjin. When the reporters were in Zhangjiakou, the price of kerosene was 220,000 yuan per large bucket, and the price of cigarettes fell to about 100,000 yuan per large box. The best-selling product on the market is Shanghai-made coffee. Small Hadtan and Single Knife cigarettes are selling very slowly, and no one cares about the cigarettes produced by the local cigarette factory in Zhangjiakou. This situation is no different from that in other places.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Education Repatriation Results</p>
<p>In the entire reconstruction process of Zhangjiakou, the results of education repatriation are the most satisfactory. Mayor Zhou proudly reported to the reporters the situation of how primary and secondary schools in Zhangjiakou were gradually reopened within one or two weeks. Zhangjiakou originally had thirty-nine primary schools, and now all of them have been reopened. The number of faculty and staff has also increased from 193 to 235, the number of classes has also increased by 38, from 158 to 196, and the number of students has also increased from 7,100 to 7,727, an increase of 627. This nearly 10,000 primary school students may not seem surprising in Beijing and Shanghai, but please remember that the current total population of Zhangjiakou is less than 140,000 (only more than 120,000 at the beginning of the restoration), and the proportion of primary school students is not small.</p>
<p>The authorities are very concerned about the teachers in the primary schools and have successively allocated 110,000 yuan in temporary relief funds. Recently, the Ministry of Education has also allocated 15 million yuan as relief funds for unemployed teachers and out-of-school youths, which will undoubtedly be a small supplement to the hard-working teachers.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou originally had four secondary schools, and now the Provincial Middle School and the Provincial Normal School have resumed classes. In order to provide relief to out-of-school youths, the Provincial Middle School was approved to increase the number of classes, and recently held a new student examination. In addition, Saibei Middle School is also preparing to reopen. Chief Fu promised to help recover the school property and raise funds, and classes may be opened in the spring.</p>
<h3>A Night of Wild Revelry at the Empty School</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, January 5th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this newspaper</p>
<p>During the day on New Year's Eve of the 35th year, more than 30 Stearman training aircraft that had crossed the Hump formed a large formation of the words "Thirty-Six" in the sky over Hangzhou. This was to tell the citizens of Hangzhou: "The 36th year has arrived. What will we use to welcome it?"</p>
<p>That night, the cradle of the Chinese Air Force—Jianqiao Air Force Officer School—had a grand gathering, and I was invited to attend. Accompanying me were Mr. Sun, Director of the Zhejiang Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and Mr. Zhu Xiujue, Deputy Director. We passed through the busy Jianqiao Highway and through the guards of the Air Force School, directly to the front of the Air Force School's auditorium. The tall Western-style building was adorned with two Arabic numerals "36" built of electric torches. All the buildings around the school and the equipment on the airfield were brightly lit, as if the cradle of the Chinese Air Force had been embellished with jewels.</p>
<p>Laughter and the Smell of Alcohol</p>
<p>The car stopped, the door opened, and smartly dressed Air Force officers greeted us. We signed our names on white silk, took off our coats, passed through the auditorium, and arrived at the reception room where we used to come often. It was already full of guests. There were noble female guests and valiant Air Force officers. We were led to Denglou, and many people had arrived before us. Director Zhu Huanshou of the Political Department warmly shook hands and introduced their senior Air Force officers and their wives. Director of Education Hu Weike also came and said with a smile, "You're here, that's great. We were just trying to pick you up!"</p>
<p>Allied land and air officers also came one after another. They brought their beautiful wives and girlfriends. Director Hu's wife was wearing a short cheongsam made of purple-red wool and high-heeled shoes with black lace flowers, greeting the guests back and forth. Secretary-General Lei Fazhang of Zhejiang Province Chairman Shen Chengzhang and Hangzhou Mayor Zhou Qiyu also came together. A burst of pleasant laughter vibrated in the building.</p>
<p>Toasting and Wishing Each Other Progress</p>
<p>The banquet was Chinese cuisine, from Lou Wai Lou. The host of our table was Mr. Zhao Shan, Deputy Director of the Education Department. He diligently urged us to drink. He said that his wife could not drink, but she had already drunk seven or eight cups. Director Hu came to toast again. He has a hearty and straightforward personality and drank many cups in one breath. Director Shi Zhu came to toast again, which aroused the guests' reciprocation, especially some Allied officers. They used absolutely overwhelming gestures to toast the host and the Chinese guests. This powerful force was finally resisted, "Ha, ha, ha;" A burst of "Hahahaha" filled the outdoors.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Zhao had already drunk more than seventy cups. He repeatedly told me that an aviation club should be established in Hangzhou City so that the public and the Air Force can become one. He said: "Foreigners have a really strong interest in aviation, but many Chinese people still regard it as a dangerous road." Therefore, he advocated promoting aviation interest, promoting the aviation industry, and promoting aerial activities. He grabbed my arm and said, "This matter requires a lot of advocacy!"</p>
<p>Chairman Shen stood up and said, "I just came back from a foreign county today. It should have been New Year's Eve, and I should have spent it at home, but the Air Force School is like our home. As soon as I unloaded my luggage, I rushed over. We have seen the Chinese Air Force gradually grow, and we feel unparalleled excitement. Today I want to toast and wish the Chinese Air Force health and progress, and the Allied people health and progress." The sound of clinking glasses and toasting rose again, forming another wave of joyful enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Participating in a Music and Dance Party</p>
<p>The wine was waning, and every lady's face seemed to be painted redder. The male guests were also drunk. We were invited to participate in a music and dance party. When we went downstairs through the auditorium, the aviation school theater troupe was performing Cao Yu's "Wilderness." The auditorium was black and crowded with people, and it was quiet and silent. We poked our heads into the auditorium, and the clear lines were heard clearly.</p>
<p>Is this a library? The dance hall was temporarily decorated. The beautiful lights were like bathing in warm springs. Strips of blue with white flower clusters added to the infinite beauty in the dance hall. The women's band played music, and Mayor Zhou and an Allied lady took the lead in dancing, followed by Director Hu and his wife. An elderly foreign lady in a small lounge asked: "Shall we go dancing?"</p>
<p>Director Hu's Mother</p>
<p>After Director Hu finished dancing, he introduced me to his mother, who turned out to be this elderly foreign lady. I realized that she was British. She pulled me to sit on the sofa where she was sitting. She said, "After my child was born, many British friends asked me why I let him go to a Chinese school? I said he was Chinese anyway!" She told me that she loved China, she loved the freedom and peace of the Chinese people, and she believed that China had a future and hope. She also told me: "Look at these many Air Force officers, how innocent, lively, and enthusiastic!"</p>
<p>Director Hu also told me that he hoped to introduce all the officers and students of the school, rather than introduce himself, because he was being seduced by the innocent, lively, and enthusiastic lovely feelings of these many officers and students. Yes, these many Air Force officers and students love freedom very much? But their freedom is the freedom of the great nation. If anyone infringes on the freedom of the great nation, they will sacrifice their own freedom to exchange for the freedom of the great nation. They love the freedom of the country and the nation, and it can even be said that they also love the freedom of mankind.</p>
<p>An officer told me: "Don't look at how naughty we are tonight. During peacetime training, we don't have the same treatment as Allied air force training. When fighting, it is the same as the life of ordinary civilians. China itself is fundamentally poor, and we cannot aim too high. During the construction process, everyone has to suffer!"</p>
<p>Mayor's Accurate Dancing Posture</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou danced with Director Hu's wife again. The dance hall was crowded with people, probably forty or so couples. Director Hu went to dance for a while, then came to the lounge to greet the guests, and then sat on the tables and chairs around the dance floor. The officers were sending tangerines, handing them one by one to the guests' hands.</p>
<p>I said to Mayor Zhou with a smile: "Your dancing posture and dance method are very accurate." Mayor Zhou said: "Thank you, I am following the strict dancing rules." I said to Director Hu's wife again: "Mrs. Hu dances really well." She said with a smile: "You haven't danced with me, how do you know I dance well?" Fortunately, Director Sun relieved the siege by saying: "He is an appraiser!"</p>
<p>Happy, excited, and wild New Year's Eve of the Air Force Officer School in 1946.</p>
<p>The night grew deeper, and I wanted to go back. Mayor Zhou asked the reporter to stay again and come back together. Director Hu pulled the reporter and said: "Don't go, let's dance for a while? I'll send a car to take you back later."</p>
<p>Returning, the innocent, lively, and enthusiastic shadows of the revelry kept playing in my mind. Especially the two Arabic numerals "36" in front of the auditorium, I really don't know what to use to welcome the arrival of this 36th year!</p>

<h3>On "Reason and Democracy"</h3>
<p>— A Traditional Perspective First</p>
<p>By Zhang Dongsun Published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>"The more the words 'democracy' become clichés, the further we stray from the true realization of democracy."</p>
<p>This book was completed by Mr. Zhang when the War of Resistance against Japan had just ended. It can be said to be a theoretical work on China's future. The problems discussed are more specific than in his previous two works (namely, Knowledge and Culture and Thought and Society). However, I still believe that Mr. Zhang is discussing China's future from principles. Therefore, there are two points he can grasp: first, the world must have peace; second, China must have democracy. These are principled recognitions, and everyone should acknowledge these principles.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang puts it well that democracy is not just a political system but a distinctive civilization. In other words, democracy is not merely a slogan shouted by a few but should be a genuine way of life. This habit should not be a mechanical blind obedience but should be guided by human reason.</p>
<p>The theme of this book can be summarized into four points: (1) The progress of human civilization should be guided by reason; (2) Individuals should consciously express their personality; (3) Humanity should use reason to handle human affairs; (4) Humanity should promote the democratic spirit of freedom and equality. Finally, Mr. Zhang uses these principles to solve China's national issues.</p>
<p>(1) Progress of Civilization</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang divides human history into three periods: The first period is before human history, when people were hidden in the depths of unconsciousness, with a mental knot of a "threat of death." They could only appeal to religion; they obeyed, they worshipped, and they found peace in the belief in the immortality of the soul. The second period is from the beginning of history to the last one or two hundred years. People in this period were psychologically threatened by life, a life of mutual plunder and struggle. During this period, society trained people to have all kinds of cunning, treacherous, cruel, and hypocritical psychologies. People were strong bullying the weak, rich oppressing the poor, and clever deceiving the foolish. This kind of society is a "sick society," and such civilization is an ugly civilization. Now, sprouts have emerged outside the second period, and the third period is about to begin. This period is the flourishing of science and the rise of reason. Mr. Zhang said: "In the second period, it is almost entirely a sick society and an ugly civilization. Fortunately, reason is gradually squeezed out, pushed out, and forced out of it. And the more it is squeezed out, the bigger it becomes, and the more it is forced out. Reason is released from a narrow crevice, but it does not manage to turn around like a sea-searching lamp and still shines on the crevice itself. The usefulness of reason does not lie entirely in being able to envision the future and propose a rational society and a rational life, but rather in being able to expose and reveal the maladies of society and the shortcomings of human nature." The civilization of this period is scientific communism, "the order of which comes from objective natural evolution and does not require a predetermined formula." This seems to be greatly influenced by Bergson's theory of creative evolution, except that Bergson's main force is the "vital force," while Mr. Zhang's is the "force of reason" or "intellect."</p>
<p>(2) Personality and Human Nature</p>
<p>The progress of civilization must have spiritual freedom, and to have spiritual freedom, personality must be established. Therefore, Mr. Zhang said, "These three are inseparable." The concept of personality is the center of Western culture and the foundation for establishing Western democracy. Mr. Zhang quoted Lu Jinba in his "History of European Liberalism":</p>
<p>"Freedom is the self-awareness of oneself and one's infinite spiritual value, so it must also recognize that others have the same. Only those who feel free themselves can recognize the freedom of others."</p>
<p>I should be aware that I am a person, and I have the privilege of being a human being. Since I have my human rights, then we should also feel that others are also human beings, and they should also have human rights. The concept of freedom and equality is established in the process of developing this self-awareness. This is the characteristic of Western civilization. In Chinese civilization, what is similar to this is the Confucian concept of "human relations." Therefore, the question for those who pay attention to the future of Chinese culture is how to integrate the Confucian concept of personality with the concept of personality in Western democratic culture.</p>
<p>(3) Reason and Logic</p>
<p>"Reason" can be explained from two aspects. On the one hand, it can be explained as reason, which refers to human's understanding of the natural world or society. This wisdom includes two aspects: one is to understand the causal relationship of things and predict the effects of things from this causal relationship; the other is to extract the logical relationship of things and seek the meaning of known things from the process of deduction. This belongs to the intellectual aspect, and it is constantly developing and increasing. On the other hand, the term "reason" can also be explained as the reasonable attitude in human relations, which belongs to the attitude of being a person. Usually, we say that someone's actions are very reasonable. Nowadays, people who are reasonable are not necessarily knowledgeable, while people who are knowledgeable are often not reasonable to others. This kind of reason is eternal. This kind of reason can only be understood and cannot be passed on by words. Westerners value wisdom, while Chinese people value reason. Therefore, Mr. Zhang advocates that China must revive the traditional "style of reasoning" in the future, and at the same time, it must hone its reason and improve its ideals like Westerners.</p>
<p>(4) Freedom and Democracy</p>
<p>Freedom is a moral concept. Freedom is the rational combination between people. The more rational, the more free. Mr. Zhang said: "Chinese people think that democratic systems easily cause trouble, that freedom is indulgence and casualness, and that equality is the high accommodating to the low. But they do not know that these are completely wrong... It should be known that freedom, equality, and democracy are all moral disputes. But morality is not about blaming others, but about disciplining oneself. There must be a democratic spirit in one's blood vessels and dantian. One must have the intention of accommodating others and establishing oneself in every action, so as to form a democratic society... Democracy must be integrated with life... and it must be known that it is impossible for oneself to be undemocratic and hope that others will practice democracy. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for political parties. To do this, one must thoroughly stand on rationalism, because reason and morality are fundamentally one."</p>
<p>The above is a brief description of Mr. Zhang's views. I think this brief description may be helpful to those who read Mr. Zhang's original works, because Mr. Zhang's thoughts are too abundant when he writes, and he often pulls them too far, which can easily make readers feel like they are lost in a fog. Mr. Zhang himself is well aware of this, so it is beneficial to readers to bring up his theme and talk about it. Below, we are prepared to express some opinions on this book in terms of its content, method, and narrative attitude to seek correction from Mr. Dongsun and all readers.</p>
<p>Regarding the theoretical content of Mr. Zhang, we completely agree with the theme. For example, he said that democracy means that individuals must have freedom in their habits, thoughts, and spirits, and that individual freedom is to act rationally in the crowd, which we completely agree with. However, we feel that Mr. Zhang has not fully developed his theory on the relationship between freedom and democracy, and between freedom and reason. If democracy is regarded as a way of life, then anyone with a democratic spirit must be able to make his own decisions about his habits, thoughts, and emotions without blindly following others, let alone being mechanically controlled by others; and he will not wantonly control or undermine the initiative of others' habits, thoughts, and emotions. But what kind of person can truly be autonomous? What kind of person can truly make others autonomous? An autonomous person is not indulgent or casual. A truly autonomous person is someone who has a clear understanding of all things, whose choices are reasonable, and whose actions are meant to produce the greatest benefit for the development of human culture. He has knowledge, has unique insights, is reasonable, and pursues welfare. A person who makes others truly autonomous should help others to gain a clear understanding of the situation, have the wisdom to distinguish right from wrong, and have a sincere intention to put oneself in others' shoes. So I have an idea that I think politicians cannot be truly democratic, because an experienced politician always hopes that others will believe in his views, obey his organization, and abide by his discipline. I think the person who truly has a democratic spirit is an educator, but this educator is not an educator who only lectures, but an educator who helps others improve their reason in dealing with people and the world. If politicians can be democratic, then they must help others in the attitude of an educator so that they are good at using their wisdom, careful in deciding what to choose, and pursue the welfare of the public from an autonomous position.</p>
<p>I think that Mr. Zhang's failure to express himself freely in terms of theoretical content is related to his research method. The method used by Mr. Zhang to solve problems is the method of doing scholarship. The so-called method of doing scholarship is that Mr. Zhang uses the historical method on the one hand, that is, Mr. Zhang seeks a way out from the evolution trend of history. We agree with this, but we feel that Mr. Zhang pays too much attention to the evolution of historical thoughts and doctrines and not enough to find a path from the evolution of social life and social psychology. Another method used by Mr. Zhang is the comparison method of the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western cultures, which is also correct, but what he compares are still a few special concepts of Chinese and Western cultures. As for how these special concepts are produced from their special social backgrounds, Mr. Zhang has not given us a more detailed indication. Therefore, we feel that Mr. Zhang is still doing scholarship and not solving practical problems.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is one of the people I admire most in the Chinese academic circle. My respect for him is unquestionable, and he should have his own arrogance, but in this book, his attitude towards people seems to be lacking in humility when he discusses problems, which is what I want to say to Mr. Zhang. For example, he said: "Except for Mr. Zhang Junmai, I am afraid that I am the most qualified person in the country to speak about democracy in his words." Also, for example: "My opinions on these issues are more complicated, and cannot be exhausted in a few words... Readers must be patient in order to understand my views." Also, for example, saying: "This is my original idea." Although these are minor flaws, they have a great impact on the reader's psychology. Also, for example, "Except for Ma Yifu, Liang Shuming, Xiong Shili, etc., who still have the demeanor of a scholar-gentleman, there are simply fewer and fewer of them," this statement also seems to be too specific. I wonder what Mr. Zhang thinks?</p>
<p>Introducing a Book</p>
<h3>Map of Chinese Topography</h3>
<p>— Sun Panshou</p>
<p>Compiled by the Chinese Historical and Geographical Chart Compilation Society Published by Yaguang and Dixue Society</p>
<p>To make a map, it must be rough enough to give people a clear impression, and detailed enough to find multiple meanings from it. It is as difficult as writing a painting that is suitable for viewing from a distance and can also be appreciated up close. This map is made by the author, who integrates excellent cartographic techniques and profound geographical knowledge, into a "Three-Dimensional Topographical Map of China," which is both complete and beautiful.</p>
<p>This map uses the three-dimensional depiction method to represent the topography. The general trend of the rivers and mountains of the whole country is clear at a glance. Mountains, plateaus, hills, basins, and plains are all displayed on the map according to their actual shapes and positions, which is enough for readers to carefully observe and study. Looking at this map, it is like looking at a photograph of our country, which stretches over 10 million square kilometers, and you get a real feeling.</p>
<p>Photographs show the appearance of people, and color photographs further render the true colors of people, making them look more vivid. This map has not forgotten to add various natural colors to itself. In the Kangzang area, high mountains above 5,000 meters are covered with snow all year round. These places are covered with white on the map. Plateaus, mountains, and hills with lower altitudes are dyed gray, ocher, or yellow according to their original colors. The plains are generally covered with green. Waterways, lakes, and oceans are printed in light blue or dark blue according to their depth. Therefore, this map is also unintentionally a color photograph of the landform of China. Paying attention to these natural colors, the actual scene of each place will inevitably appear in your mind. In addition, the map shows the national boundaries, provincial boundaries, and important cities, which is especially helpful for people who are new to reading maps.</p>
<p>In the lower right corner of the map, there is an explanation of three to four thousand words, written by Mr. Lu Cunhe. It gives a concise description of the characteristics of the national topography, the division of topographical regions, and the method of reading maps. Readers who study the explanation while looking at the map will definitely gain a further understanding of the Chinese topography.</p>
<p>Now, many geography teachers are suffering from the lack of suitable wall charts when they talk about the topography of this map. The publication of this map is really good news for them. The general public has always had a very vague concept of the topography of their own country. This map can at least show them the outline of the national landform, so that they can absorb a little more geographical meaning than looking at a wall chart of one color per province. The purpose of my writing this short introduction is to let readers know this noteworthy news first. The benefits of this map cannot be fully stated in just a few hundred words. Fortunately, it will be published soon. If you want to understand its true value, please read the original map in detail.</p>
<h3>"Fear and Courage"</h3>
<p>— Chen Shu</p>
<p>A War History in the Form of a Novel</p>
<p>By Beck Published by the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House</p>
<p>Things of special significance in the world will always occupy space in history, as a kind of alarm or reference for future generations. Therefore, history is like a mirror, which can reflect all kinds of things in the past. When we think back to October 1941, when the German bandits used "blitzkrieg tactics" to advance towards the Soviet capital step by step, and Moscow was in imminent danger; but because of the Soviet army's calm resistance, the Battle of Moscow finally became a turning point for victory, we will definitely wonder what the key was in between. Then "Fear and Courage" can tell you. This is a record of war events written in the style of a novel, narrated by Bavourzhang and Morsh Ulei, the commanders of the Moscow defense at the time, and recorded by Beck.</p>
<p>It tells us that at that time, the German bandits used a large number of troops to attack Moscow, while the Soviet army was far behind in number. The mission of Ulei's battalion was to use one battalion—about seven hundred soldiers—to defend a six-kilometer section of the highway at the gate of Moscow, so that the German army could not drive straight in. Because the number of troops was so disparate, Ulei could not help but win by wisdom; he pondered day and night, deliberating on all the tactics he had envisioned. In the war, he also learned the experience that "argument in war is not like argument in logic and mathematics. In war, it is proved by blood." At the same time, there was always a kind of fear in his heart constantly fighting with reason, and he tried his best to make reason overcome fear. As the war progressed, the Soviet army's positions were breached in several places by the German army, and Ulei's battalion of soldiers was gradually surrounded. In terms of the situation, his battalion of troops was in great danger of being wiped out, but he did not receive an order to retreat. A contradiction arose in his heart again: If he persisted, he might be wiped out. If he retreated, there was no order. When he thought of "honor is more valuable than life," his problem was solved again; at the same time, he also remembered his superior, Commander Panfilov's conversation with him, which also encouraged and guided him. He made his spirit rejuvenate, and he insisted on the end with the German bandits with wisdom, and did not retreat without an order. In order to inspire morale and protect the noble soldiers, he often used Panfilov's words of "take care of soldiers, not with empty words, but with actions and firepower" to warn himself.</p>
<p>In the snow and ice, under the bombing of German aircraft, and in the German army's attack, Ulei used a calm mind to deal with everything. Finally, he received Panfilov's order that he had to retreat. Under the leadership of Ulei, Ulei's battalion of soldiers safely withdrew from the dangerous area "with care and protection using action and firepower." Because his containment of the German army made their actions inconvenient, the Soviet army gained an advantage in time, and the Soviet army's reinforcements arrived, relieving the siege of Moscow and becoming the key to victory.</p>
<p>From this, we know how important the commander has for the war! Both for his subordinates and for the enemy. At the same time, the commander is not the so-called "iron man," he also has fear and contradictions, it all depends on how he overcomes the weaknesses in his heart. This may be the key to victory.</p>
<p>If you readers want to know more details, you may as well buy a copy to read, and the fluency of the translation and the tension of the content are like a war film.</p>
<h3>Democracy and Design</h3>
<p>— Chen Tao</p>
<p>Original by D. Lilienthal Translated and described by Xu Zhonghang Published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>At a time when everyone is paying close attention to economic democracy, this is indeed a good book worth introducing.</p>
<p>The original author of Democracy and Design, Mr. Lilienthal, is the chairman of TVA (abbreviation for Tennessee Valley Authority). Based on his ten years of experience, he described the process of this great undertaking from the occurrence of the problem to the solution in detail, with great enthusiasm and great faithfulness. He did not hide the various obstacles that had occurred—such as the suspicion of the people, the indifference of industrialists, and the insistence of experts on their own opinions, etc. Finally, he overcame them by grasping the principles of democracy. Finally, he arrived at a new understanding, that is: "To get new jobs, new factories, and fertile farmland, it is not necessary to choose between the two extremes of left and right, it is not necessary to choose between an over-centralized and huge government and powerless policies, and it is not necessary to choose between private enterprise and socialism." The author further summed up his experience and said: "The best and perhaps the only way to do things effectively is to follow the unity of nature, to follow democratic methods, and to have people actively participate every day." This is the essence of the experimental achievements of the TVA, which implements democratic design and combines science with life, technology with the people. It is also what the author wants to clarify with concrete things in this book. "In this valley, it has been proven that some methods (which the author calls grassroots democratic methods) can be developed, thereby providing greater happiness, deeper experience, and creating opportunities for freedom in the course of technological progress."</p>
<p>According to the narration of all twenty chapters of the book, we can know that the success of TVA today is by no means accidental, but has its successful conditions:</p>
<p>First, it relies on the support of the government—the President and the Congress—absolute trust, and at the same time, TVA is absolutely responsible to the government.</p>
<p>Second, it relies on the full cooperation of scientists, engineers, and technicians. According to a certain plan, they have worked hard for ten years, and have been able to get rid of the constraints of bureaucratic politics and party struggles.</p>
<p>Third, it relies on the correctness of the goal, always seeking the interests of the people, so it can get the enthusiastic participation of the people.</p>
<p>What was the situation in the Tennessee River Valley ten years ago? According to the author himself, "The river has become a threat of flooding, and the land and people are suffering from the state of desolation and drought." He also said: "The Tennessee River has often been a destructive monster in the past."</p>
<p>Now, ten years later, it has changed to another new scene. The author said: "You can see this change everywhere you go. You can see the power lines along the road, the newly painted houses, the newly installed electric water pumps in the countryside, and the cold storage, sawmills, and grinding mills set up at the crossroads. You can also see the factories that are there today, which a few years ago were exhausted farmland and rows of thatched huts. Now you see tens of thousands of new houses on the edge of the town." He also said: "New private industries have been built here, companies that had closed down have been revived, people have more money in their hands, tax malpractices have been reduced, bank deposits have increased, and the purchasing power of the market has been strengthened."</p>
<p>How was this significant change achieved? It started with the construction of many reservoirs to collect the water flowing down from the mountains, which was converted into electricity through a large steel pipe to supply various factories and residents in the basin. In the season of heavy rain, the management used radio to direct the opening of the stored water in each reservoir to accommodate rainwater and avoid floods. Because of the regulation of rainwater, the soil of farmland is prevented from being washed away by water. The management also provides free憐酸fertilizers to increase soil fertility. Naturally, agricultural production has increased, and the number of livestock and poultry has also increased. The reservoirs have sluices, which turn the rapid rivers into flat river surfaces, which can facilitate shipping. Furthermore, 54% of the valley is planted with trees, totaling 14 million acres of woodland. Furthermore, the roads, houses, medical and health care, cultural education, and various facilities in the countryside are improved, and the new rural construction is successful.</p>
<p>The spirit of democracy is fully expressed in the entire great project, and it truly achieves the level of being owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people. Therefore, TVA is not only an economic organization, but also a political organization, which achieves the task of democratic politics in another way. But it strives to avoid getting involved in the whirlpool of partisan politics, and the people it employs are also non-partisan. Personnel working in the bureau are not allowed to participate in political activities. In this way, technical knowledge can be used exclusively to serve people's daily lives and the common goals of human improvement, and reap the harvest of the modern form of democracy and its application.</p>
<p>In order to understand the actual situation of TVA, I also consulted Mr. Wang Zuli, an engineer who had just returned from a survey in the United States. He had an internship in TVA for three months and specialized in the study of hydraulic engineering. According to him;</p>
<p>"The organization of TVA is based on the Board of Directors as the highest guidance institution. There are three directors, one appointed by the President, one appointed by the Tennessee State Government, and one appointed by the Tennessee State University. They elect one of them as the chairman, who is responsible for implementation.</p>
<p>Under the Board of Directors is the General Manager, who is actually in charge. Under the General Manager are three major departments, one in charge of rivers, one in charge of electricity, and one in charge of farmland. Each department has more than ten sections. There are many staff members. Even the Mapping Section alone has more than 800 people. The staff has a very stable life and a very serious research spirit.</p>
<p>The achievements of the management in the past ten years have completed electrical and hydraulic engineering. Now it only needs to be managed. It is now studying farmland improvement work, so there is a fertilizer plant. TVA currently has 24 dams. The electricity it generates not only supplies the residents of the Tennessee Valley, but also supplies military use during the war and is used to manufacture atomic bombs.</p>
<p>The management was established in 1933, just during the US unemployment panic. The purpose was to relieve unemployment and prevent floods, because the river has often been plagued by floods in the past, the land is barren, and the rainfall is also large, so the purpose of the reservoirs is to prevent floods, not to irrigate.</p>
<p>Although the Tennessee River Basin includes seven states, it is not as large as the Huai River Basin. The Guidance Committee of the Huai River in our country was established in the 20th year of the Republic of China, which was earlier than TVA. It is a pity that our country lacks both talents and funds, and has not been able to see success immediately."</p>
<p>Now, there is a lot of talk about setting up the YVA Yangtze River Valley Authority in China. I hope everyone will study the successful conditions of TVA to see if we can do it in the future. In my opinion, it is not just a matter of talents and funds. Even if we have talents and funds, we still have to ask if we have the spirit of getting rid of the whirlpool of partisan politics and working hard for the cause to the end.</p>

<h3>"Stratosphere" Navigation – "The Contribution of War"</h3>
<p>— Wang Yide</p>
<p>Between 15,000 and 25,000 meters above sea level, the temperature remains around minus 50 degrees Celsius year-round. Because the temperature is constant, this high altitude area is called the "stratosphere."</p>
<p>Before World War II, stratosphere aviation was considered a risky endeavor. At that time, only a few scientists and explorers engaged in stratosphere aviation. Ordinary passengers dared not attempt it, and there were no passenger planes for stratosphere flights.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the war, scientists from the participating countries vied with each other, sparing no effort to improve aircraft. The United States, in particular, had to fly aircraft above 15,000 meters due to operational necessity and to avoid enemy anti-aircraft fire. As a result, the stratosphere, once regarded as a mysterious high altitude, almost became a daily route for flying generals. The so-called stratosphere flight no longer felt novel.</p>
<p>However, stratosphere flight is not something that ordinary aircraft can handle. Because in the stratosphere, not only is the climate cold, but also the air pressure is low and oxygen is scarce. Ordinary aircraft can only ascend to about 6,000 meters. If they venture into the stratosphere, they will inevitably encounter perilous situations. For the pilot, lack of oxygen will cause suffocation, and low air pressure will cause capillaries to burst, leading to bleeding from the ears and nose. For the aircraft itself, the extreme cold at high altitude causes moisture to accumulate on the surface, easily condensing into ice. If the flight continues, the moisture increases and the ice becomes thicker. As a result, the aircraft descends because it cannot bear the load. Therefore, ordinary aircraft are not suitable for stratosphere flight.</p>
<p>Aircraft that navigate the stratosphere are called stratosphere aircraft. The B17 Flying Fortress and B29 Superfortress used by the US military during the war belong to this category. These aircraft were specially designed because ordinary aircraft cannot fly in the stratosphere. Pilots of these aircraft wear oxygen masks to prevent lack of air. The aircraft components also have special heat dissipation structures, so that the temperature inside the engine can be evenly distributed on the fuselage and wings, preventing moisture from condensing into ice. Thus, the aircraft can fly safely in the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Passenger stratosphere aircraft only appeared after the war. Their structure is different from wartime stratosphere aircraft, because asking passengers to wear masks during the flight is ultimately restrictive. Thus, someone newly designed aircraft with air chambers to regulate air pressure and temperature to suit the normal needs of the human body, just like on the ground. In the United States, a large number of these passenger stratosphere aircraft have been converted from bombers, called Stratocruiser, which directly translates to "Stratosphere Cruiser." The size of its fuselage can be imagined.</p>
<p>In the stratosphere, because the air is thin and the air pressure is low, the resistance during flight is less, so the speed can be increased. After the war, many countries opened up stratosphere routes. Our country is also ordering new aircraft from the United States. If they are delivered, we can easily travel between Chongqing and Shanghai in a few hours.</p>

<p>"Brothers," said the chaplain. "Today my subject is liars. How many of you have read Matthew chapter 69?" Almost every soldier in the service raised his hand, though a few hesitated.</p>
<p>"You are exactly the people I want to preach to," said the chaplain. "Because you know, there is no such chapter in the Bible." Translated from (CatholicReview)</p>
<h3>Suzhou Dialect</h3>
<p>— Shengshen</p>
<p>The language of Suzhou people is really a headache. Its implications are infinitely mysterious, and it has depth and shallowness. Therefore, it often makes outsiders feel like a Shandong person eating wheat winter, unable to understand at all.</p>
<p>Suzhou dialect is divided into three categories: local vernacular, 'qiekou', and shortened rhyme.</p>
<p>Local vernacular is most suitable for women to speak, especially the general female storytellers in the book circles are more pleasant to hear, really like the song of a oriole and the murmur of a swallow, if you sing the tune at the beginning of the chapter, charming singing, gentle, it is really a special feeling to hear. As the saying goes; "I would rather scold with a Suzhou person than talk to a Ningbo person".</p>
<p>Shortened rhymes mostly consist of idioms of four characters per sentence, omitting the last character to form a language.</p>
<p>Like "City God Old Lord"; Kang San Gu "Niang"; Chicken Feather Dus"ter"; Tan Song Mao "Pang"; Wind blows Cold "Da" are very popular shortened rhymes; others include Mo Ming Qi "Tudi Tang" (Nuo: The sound of "挼" "　", and "temple" and "Tudi Tang" seem to have the same meaning.) Miao Bu Ke "Jiang You" "Jiang You" is "salt" so it is similar to the sound of the word "Yan".)</p>
<p>'Qiekou' is the Suzhou vernacular with the deepest meaning. Only two Suzhou people can fully answer each other in 'qiekou'. Not to mention that outsiders cannot understand, people who are not nurtured by Suzhou dialect, no matter how clever you are, I am afraid you cannot guess the meaning. 'Qiekou' was originally the local vernacular of general literati, and later it turned into the slang of the lower class. Like "Above is Huangliang, below is the sea, and in the middle there is a small threshold." (The above sentence means a woman says when she is not satisfied: "I have parents-in-law above me, children below me, and a husband in the middle").</p>
<p>"A big 'gui' cannot be crawled out of a small hole." (This means that a person is unwilling to spend the appropriate amount of money and cannot buy good things.</p>
<p>"Shang Xiang Tou" (The ordinary "Shang Xiang Tou" refers to the ghosts possessing the bodies of the female sorcerers, but "Shang Xiang Tou" in 'qiekou' means guests come to visit.)</p>
<p>"A sesame head can be big." (It is like preparing to do a small thing. But thinking about it, it is annoying horizontally and difficult vertically, but it makes it impossible to handle,) "dustpan facing each other, broken broom" (It means the opposite of so-called talented men and beautiful women.)</p>
<p>Looking at the language of Suzhou people in this way, it is indeed extremely complicated, making listeners have to rack their brains.</p>
<p>Anecdotes and Common Sense</p>
<h3>"Tattoo Gang"</h3>
<p>— Huang Jieqing</p>
<p>My country already had tattoos in the Song Dynasty. The soldiers recruited at that time were all tattooed with characters on the back of their hands, dyed with pigments, which would not disappear for life, as a means of identification and to prevent desertion during battle.</p>
<p>In later dynasties after the Song Dynasty, serious criminals who were sent to distant garrisons were tattooed with golden characters on their faces; minor criminals were tattooed on their foreheads, called "ink punishment". During the late Qing Dynasty, all criminals, robbers, thieves, and deserters were tattooed. First-time thieves were tattooed on the right arm, and repeat offenders were tattooed on the left arm; first-time deserters were tattooed on the right face, and repeat offenders were tattooed on the left face. Each crime was tattooed in a different place.</p>
<p>In Japan, for more than two hundred years, criminals involved in robbery cases were tattooed before being released after serving their sentences, in order to facilitate investigation and arrest in case of recidivism. It was not until modern fingerprinting could be applied that ink punishment was abolished.</p>
<p>As for tattooing the whole body, chest, arms, back, with colorful patterns, it is popular among various ethnic groups around the world, which is the so-called "tattoo". Half of it is for decoration or commemoration, and half of it is a symbol of "courage." In fact, they are all just remnants of barbarism.</p>
<p>In 1925, the Shanghai police once ordered the arrest of the "Tattoo Gang." Because at that time, it was said that the Shanghai gangsters had secret organizations. All members had patterns tattooed on their arms and legs as identification. As a result, the city was in an uproar. Originally, most people with "tattoos" were low-level workers, so at that time, even barbers, bathhouse scrubbers, boatmen, and sailors did not dare to go out, because once arrested, they would have to spend a lot of effort explaining.</p>
<p>Sailors and those engaged in maritime work in various European and American countries mostly tattoo their names or symbols on their bodies, so that if something unexpected happens, relatives and friends can identify them. But there are also strange patterns and absurd words. In the past, there was an American sailor who tattooed portraits of the two great men Washington and Lincoln on his chest, and added the words "fierce face and kind heart" under his neck. Another person tattooed a pair of Indian wedding pictures on his chest. Another person tattooed a beer bottle on his left arm, a sailor molesting a woman on his right arm, and three young and beautiful Spanish girls on his chest, which can be described as a magnificent sight. In addition, there was a mischievous man who tattooed the words "What women love" below his navel and abdomen. A woman tattooed the signatures of several lovers on her arm. Another woman tattooed a "sword piercing the heart" on her left arm, with the words "In memory of dear Mr. Laurel". In addition, many women in Japanese cities have colorful patterns tattooed all over their bodies.</p>

<h3>The Disguise of Beggars</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>Every adult beggar, regardless of gender, must wear a tattered coat and carry a long stick before they can beg on the street. Because this tattered coat is the beggar's symbol, indicating that they are indeed too poor to be considered, thereby arousing the benefactor's compassion. But if we carefully observe that tattered coat, we cannot help but be suspicious. Because if a piece of clothing (the tattered coat is limited to the upper body clothing) is worn until it is old and broken, to the point where it can no longer be worn, it will never be broken into such a fragmented appearance. This is naturally the result of the beggars' painstaking use of artificial techniques, adding patches, and connecting them, and tying them into knots one by one. It is simply impossible to find a two-square-inch piece of intact cloth on a tattered coat. Every beggar has spent a lot of time and energy to create such a tattered coat. It is called a hundred knots, but in fact it is more than a hundred knots. And no matter how broken the surface is, there is a lining inside. Although this lining is also patched with miscellaneous colored cloth, it is generally airtight. In the cold season, several not-too-bad old clothes can also be worn inside the tattered coat. But passers-by cannot see it. When I was young, I saw an old beggar woman wearing a similar tattered coat. My mother could not bear it and gave her an old cotton-padded coat, asking her to wear it outside to keep out the cold. But the beggar woman stubbornly wore it inside the tattered coat. According to her, if good clothes are worn outside, no one will give her money anymore. Although the tattered coat is so broken that it is not a coat, it has one or two extremely strong large pockets inside to store money.</p>
<p>Dog Avoidance Secrets</p>
<p>Although wearing a tattered coat is beneficial for begging, it also attracts harassment from groups of dogs. Especially in villages and towns, every household has dogs, domestic dogs and stray dogs, constantly looking for trouble. As soon as they see a tattered coat beggar coming, then "one dog barks at the shadow, and all the dogs bark." Without dog avoidance secrets, this begging rice is also inedible. The beggar gang has various dog avoidance secrets passed down from their ancestors, and their only weapon is a long stick in their hand. But to use it smoothly, it also requires experience and training. Beggars firmly believe in the principle of "dogs that bite don't bark, and dogs that bark don't bite." So although there are many barking dogs, they are not anxious, but only focus on the two fierce dogs that do not bark. When they rush up, they will stab the long stick into the dog's mouth twice. The fierce dog will definitely be injured and run away. At this time, the dogs that were cheering on, seeing their brave vanguard defeated, will also run away in all directions.</p>

<h3>Idle Talk about Zou Lu</h3>
<p>— Jifeng</p>
<p>Zou Lu (Haibin), a member of the Central Committee who is already sixty-five years old, recently suddenly suffered a stroke and is being treated in the Central Hospital. He is stubborn in nature and can be compared with Hu Hanmin in the history of the Party and the country. When he was young, he was capable and promising. He once ran a small newspaper called "Yi Ke Bao" with Chen Jiongming in Hong Kong, attacking the government without leaving any room. At that time, the Founding Father and Zhu Zhixin were planning activities, and Zou joined the Tongmenghui at this time, and spent time day and night with Hu Zhentang, Deng Muhan, etc., becoming close friends.</p>
<p>After the Republic of China, he served as an envoy and director of finance, and later transferred to the education sector, serving as the president of Guangdong Higher Normal School and National Guangdong University successively. In 1925, the first Central Executive Committee members Lin Sen, Ju Zheng, Tan Zhen, and Zou and more than ten others held a meeting in front of the Founding Father's spirit in Xishan, Beiping, and resolved to dismiss the Bolodin et al. proposal, and people regarded Zou as the Xishan Conference faction.</p>
<p>Zou has a considerable position in Guangdong Province. When Japan was planning to invade China in 1936, General Matsui specially visited Zou Lu in Guangzhou to discuss Sino-Japanese issues. At that time, Zou directly said: "To be honest with you, no Chinese person does not hate the Japanese. Japan has three methods to deal with China: 'rob' north of the Yellow River, 'scare' the Yangtze River basin, and 'deceive' the Pearl River basin, regardless of whether its terms use 'friendship', 'Pan-Asianism', or 'unification'. Its invasion is one." Zou spoke bluntly and did not wait for Matsui to babble, and shouted: "I simply do not believe in the Japanese, don't talk, don't talk—" and sent Matsui out of Tianmen.</p>
<p>Zou served as the president of Sun Yat-sen University for many years. He is good at literature and reads a lot. His works are scattered in magazines such as "Republic of China", "Construction", "Zhengyi", and "New China". His articles written before the Republic of China were all destroyed by bombs in the Consultative Bureau's residence during the restoration. Now there are books such as "Zou Lu's Collected Works", "History of the Chinese Kuomintang", "History of the Guangzhou March 29 Revolution", and "Travels to Twenty-Nine Countries".</p>
<p>Among the important figures in the Party and the country, besides Dai Jitao, Zou Lu is probably the only one who believes in Buddhism; at home, Zou often chants Buddhist scriptures and repents with his Buddhist wife, and has a specially built Buddhist hall that is exceptionally clean.</p>
<p>Zou's face is different from others. His teeth are particularly long. Physiognomists once commented that he looked like a pictograph and judged him to have a noble appearance. But later, Nuo remarried. Feeling that his long teeth were unsightly, he had them pulled out by a dentist. It is said that at that time, astrologers sighed endlessly, believing that he had destroyed his good fortune.</p>
<p>Let's stop here. The reporter would like to hope that Zou will recover soon!</p>

<h3>The Story of the Suspension Bridge</h3>
<p>— Zhou Gui</p>
<p>The world is full of miracles often born from the love between two sexes, and one can find many such examples in both Chinese and foreign history. I recall that the invention of the sewing machine was also due to an affectionate husband who, seeing his beloved wife laboriously and time-consumingly sewing clothes by hand, tried every possible means to create a sewing machine to replace handwork. What an enviable thing this is!</p>
<p>The suspension bridge at Dujiangyan in Guan County, near Chengdu, Sichuan, also contains a touching story. Last autumn, I personally visited the place and was told this story by Mr. Zhang, the owner of the Youth Travel Agency. Mr. Yu Youren, in his commemorative poem, referred to the suspension bridge as the "Couple Bridge," in contrast to the "Father and Son Temple" (Li Bing and his son created the Dujiangyan water conservancy project, and later generations commemorated the Li family's achievements by building the "Fu Neng Temple" east of Dujiangyan), which is considered a beautiful tale.</p>
<p>It is said that in the early Qing Dynasty, due to the turbulent water flow in the Dujiangyan area, no bridges were built, but there was an official ferry, and people could cross the river for free. Not far from the south bank lived a scholar named He Xiande. He set up a village school at home, teaching a few young students. Every day when the sun was about to set, because there were no taverns in the village, he would ride a mule to the riverbank, take the official ferry, cross the river to drink a cup of "Gan Jiu" (a Sichuan wine like sorghum liquor). Because he had a mule crossing the river with him and was a dignified scholar, the boatman would ask for one copper coin as a reward each time, allowing him to cross the river alone in a boat. This went on for several years until unfortunately, there was a poor harvest, and the economy of this Mr. He suffered. However, he was accustomed to crossing the river to drink and did not give up his habit because of his financial setbacks. Crossing the river was not only for drinking but also for chatting with old friends (in Sichuan dialect, "bai long men zhen," meaning chatting), which was also a social center at that time and could relieve the boredom of a day in the school. However, the travel expense of two copper coins for each round trip was quite considerable at the time. Because at that time, a person could have a feast at a tavern for only three or four copper coins. With the decrease in economic income, this kind of expenditure became even more serious for Mr. He. He thought, this is an official ferry, others don't pay, why do I have to pay? This boatman is really extorting me.</p>
<p>Therefore, he went to the county government to accuse the boatman. When the boatman heard that this Mr. He was accusing him of extortion, he was extremely anxious. So, he ran to a wicked lawyer for help. The wicked lawyer drafted a defense for him, saying, "Dujiangyan is an official ferry, and people crossing the river have never been charged a ferry fee. But Mr. He's situation is different. He crosses the river alone (i.e., in a boat alone) and brings a mule with him. The mule's feet are nailed with iron, and the boat planks are easily damaged when getting on and off the boat. This humble one charges one copper coin each time to repair the boat planks. As for Mr. He himself, he is free of charge like other passengers. Please, Your Honor, have mercy." When the trial began, the county official listened to the plaintiffs and defenses of both parties and felt that the boatman was not at fault. So, he ruled that Mr. He had lost the case.</p>
<p>How could He Xiande get over this setback in his heart? Many of his friends also felt indignant. Is it really impossible for a scholar to reason with an illiterate boatman? Knowing that a wicked lawyer was behind it, but things were like this, there was nothing to do. However, they always wanted to build a bridge at Dujiangyan so that they would not be bullied by this boatman.</p>
<p>The season was early winter. The north wind howled on the withering leaves, and sometimes they fell one by one in the air. Mr. He's wife was as capable and thrifty as other village women. She made all the shoes for the family herself. She often turned the long bench upside down on the ground, with the four legs facing up, and wrapped the thread for making shoe soles around it one turn after another. One day, Mr. He was sitting beside her smoking to relieve his boredom, watching his wife winding the shoe thread. Suddenly, a yellow leaf fell on these turns of thread and stopped, not falling down. He happily said to his wife, "Stop for a moment, look, this yellow leaf can stay on this thread. Suppose we use many bamboo ropes (splitting bamboo into thin threads, weaving them into ropes, the thinner ones are used for towing boats, prevalent in Hunan and Sichuan) according to this principle, build bridge piers on the sandbar, connect them from the south bank to the north bank, and pave them with horizontal wooden planks, wouldn't that be a bridge that people can walk on? The success of this bridge will surely relieve the accumulated hatred in my chest." His wife also agreed to this plan. Because funding needed to be raised, they told many classmates and friends, and everyone expressed their support and gave him a lot of help. So, they raised funds, purchased materials, hired workers, and built this "Suspension Bridge" at Dujiangyan. Mr. He and his wife, as well as their relatives and friends who sympathized with them, were very happy. And the boatman of the official ferry could only change his profession.</p>
<p>But the only flaw was that this scholar, who "knew everything about the world," was an outsider to bridge building and couldn't have considered everything thoroughly. This bridge only had a bridge deck and no railings on both sides, and it was half a mile long and on a river surface facing high mountains to the north. The north wind in winter was really blowing sand and rocks. The river below was also very turbulent. This swaying long suspension bridge was really dangerous!</p>
<p>Not many days after it was built, one morning, because the villagers were rushing to the market, the bridge was too crowded, and as a result, the bridge overturned. In such cold weather, people who fell into the river rarely survived. So, Mr. He's fate fell into a cloud of sorrow again.</p>
<p>After this tragedy occurred, the boatman of the official ferry went to consult with the wicked lawyer on how to maintain his ferry business. Getting instructions from the wicked lawyer, he went to the county government to accuse Mr. He of building a suspension bridge that was like child's play, causing people to die. So, Mr. He had no way to defend himself and was finally imprisoned. His other relatives and friends also disappeared, fearing that they would be implicated. And He Xiande died of illness in prison soon after being depressed and angry. The boatman resumed his official ferry.</p>
<p>In the eyes of bystanders, this suspension bridge case gradually faded away after Mr. He's death. But the trauma in his wife's heart was constantly aching. How could she face her husband if she didn't vent this anger? After Mr. He's death, he still had a young son dreaming sweet dreams in the cradle. One day, his widowed mother was sitting beside his cradle doing needlework. One foot was stepping on the curved wooden strip under the cradle to push it. She thought about the overturning of the suspension bridge again. She realized that the cradle swayed but the child would not fall out because there were railings on both sides. If the suspension bridge also had railings on both sides, it would not overturn. So, she went to discuss it with her husband's relatives and friends, and as a result, everyone unanimously agreed. This became the original and scientific suspension bridge, a miracle of the world. Although He Xiande died in the line of duty before completing his work, his virtuous wife completed this immortal task.</p>
<p>You're leaving! This is the decision you've already made. On such a cold winter night, your departure clearly increases my sadness even more.</p>
<p>You said, "I'm leaving, I'm sad, and it will naturally make you even sadder!"</p>
<p>After you said that, we silently faced each other, our expressions maintaining that same rigidity, without even the slightest casual movement, fearing that something unexpected might happen or that others might see our unease. In fact, my humble bedroom, even during the day, seems to be isolated from others, let alone at night. In such a place, no one would ever come to spy on us. But we were still stifling things in that slow way, trying our best to suppress each other's inner emotions, not letting them out to create another round of intense mingling.</p>
<p>You're used to being able to restrain the exposure of strong emotions at any time, sitting upright and motionless, opening your eyes wide, staring at the dim corner of the room. And me? I'm looking at you diagonally. Suddenly, I wanted to grab your hand, bow my head and cry freely for a while, because I could no longer bear this suffocating atmosphere. This is more painful than enduring any kind of tangible punishment imposed by a tyrant! At the same time, I thought of using tears as a last resort to stop you from leaving, but I didn't do it that way. Such behavior, expressed in front of you, is too pitiful and childish.</p>
<p>The light was dim, and the cold wind outside was howling madly, the glass windows were being blown and banging. I heard your heart pounding, you seemed to be grinding your feet, as if wanting to break free from something and jump up.</p>
<p>"Have a cigarette!" You took out a pack of cigarettes from your pocket.</p>
<p>We lit cigarettes and started smoking, white hazy smoke rings coming out of the corners of your mouth; the white smoke swirled around, blurring our faces. Thin shadows filled the room, like countless soft sighs. Covering our surroundings, the smoke relieved our silent suffering.</p>
<p>I thought of wine—we used to drink together late at night when you came. I got up, ran to the cabinet by the door, opened the small door, picked up the Wujiapi wine bottle, but it was empty. I threw down the bottle, walked to the window, leaned against the window and looked outside, I didn't say a word to you, you seemed to be lighting a second cigarette.</p>
<p>Outside, the small alley leading to the main street, that lonely street lamp, like eyes after sobbing, revealed tired pupils, with only a line of yellow shadow painted on the dark wall.</p>
<p>I thought: From tomorrow onwards, this alley will only have the sound of my lonely footsteps. You used to come here often, although there were always few pedestrians in this dirty alley, there were still times in the early morning or evening when we shared the sound of two pairs of feet in harmony as we went in and out. After you leave, this alley will be like a cold and terrifying hand reaching out to my side!</p>
<p>I continued to think, you were still sitting there silently.</p>
<p>We spent a long time like this in the cold night. Because you had to catch the night train, you couldn't stay any longer. I picked up the simple luggage you brought and took you out of the alley to the main street to call a pedicab. You got into the pedicab, and the piercing cold wind was blowing fiercely. Our hands, holding each other, were like two frozen dead trees, with no exchange of warmth. You were the first to let go of my hand and urged the pedicab driver to pull the pedicab away.</p>
<p>I watched your pedicab, waiting until it turned the corner of the main street. You didn't look back once. I slowly walked back to the alley, shrinking my body, trying to avoid the cold wind. I know that emotionally you were sad about this departure. However, you cursed this foul and decadent place, you wanted to firmly leave here and embark on another new road. I understand that your strong will will not regret it, and there is no need to regret it.</p>
<p>Of course, when I stepped into the cold and deserted doorway, I remembered what you had said to me: "Is such a decadent place worth missing?"</p>

<p>Leaves, with veins as fine as those in a human hand, stretch towards the sky, every tree spreading its leaves to absorb the sunlight it deserves. Without the beauty of flowers, without the fullness of fruits, it quietly dedicates its strength to flowers and fruits, like countless hands working for an ideal, the leaf is the palm of the tree.</p>
<p>The leaf, first awakened by the spring breeze, reveals its bud to the sunlight, and in the wind and rain, it forever tells of its injustice! The leaf protects the flowers, waiting for the ripening of the fruit. When its first companion is blown down by the autumn wind, the leaf knows that winter is coming. It is aware of its fate, but it has left the fruit for the tree, and every seed contains the sunlight absorbed by the leaf!</p>
<p>The leaf, gracefully bids farewell to the tree, gathers on the soil beside the roots, protects the roots, lets the ice and snow rot it, and then nourishes the tree, for next year's flowers and fruits! And those new leaves that reveal themselves to spring and sunlight!</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 241</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Who knew that just as he had calmed down, an astonishing strange thing happened again: the light in the room flickered twice suddenly, like a person's eyes, becoming lively twice in a row.</p>
<p>"Signal!" He Jian turned his wrist, the watch pointing exactly to eleven fifteen.</p>
<p>"Got it!" He almost shouted out. It turned out that the plan specified that 03 and 011, after scouting the basement of the guards, Yuanzi must immediately send this signal, so that the four layers of arrangement inside and outside could start at the same time.</p>
<p>In this instant, He Jian had jumped up from the sofa, about to rush out of the door, when he suddenly felt hurried, rapid, and heavy footsteps on the floor, as if many people were running in the corridor outside. He Jian was stunned when he heard this sound. At this critical moment, he had to remain extremely calm, so he withdrew his intention to rush out, and instead lowered his body and sat back in the double sofa.</p>
<p>Sure enough, just as he sat down, the room door suddenly opened wide, and that polite secretary, Mr. Xiyuan, hurried in, bowing repeatedly, his expression so nervous that he couldn't speak:</p>
<p>"He Jian-jun... Excuse me, excuse me... The Prime Minister has ordered "Urgent Correction and Removal"! ...Yes... "Urgent Correction and Removal"! ...Saying this. He bowed repeatedly, very much like a person who, carelessly mistaking someone's eldest daughter for his own wife, went up and grabbed her arm; besides bringing out the Japanese national etiquette and repeatedly bowing to apologize, there was no other way.</p>
<p>"Understood!" He Jian stood up, answering as he returned a bow, his attitude as calm as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>What did He Jian's "understood" refer to? This requires asking official members of the Black Dragon Society. These four pronunciations of "Urgent Correction and Removal" are neither Esperanto nor Japanese, but a phrase of black talk within the Black Dragon Society that is blacker than black. It is a kind of emergency order, and this emergency order has many meanings: for example, if a member misses his job title or violates a serious society rule, in the instant before the execution in the Ministry of Justice, these four words will be said, which means he has to "commit seppuku". Furthermore, if a member is discovered while doing something secret and is surrounded on all sides, feeling that there is no way to escape, and only suicide can protect the secret, then before this person commits suicide, he must also inflate his lungs fully and pull up the energy from the Dantian as much as possible. No matter how big or high his voice is, he must shout a loud and crazy cry, and what is shouted is also this black talk—Urgent Correction and Removal—Of course, after shouting, the trailing sound must also include a "Bancai"! That is "Mount Tiantai Forever".</p>
