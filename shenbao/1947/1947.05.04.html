<h3>五億貸款或部份動用　美考慮眨長限期　中美租借賬目將予清理</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓二日電〕國務院官員二日吿本社訪員稱；此間現正在考慮將進出銀行五億元貸華借款之期限，延長至月卅日以後。彼等稱，中國官員在華盛頓曾非正式提出使用一部份五億元借款之計劃，詳細計劃即將提出。同時，若干國會議員則在籲請。立即貸予此項貸款，無需提出詳細計劃，僅說明其用途已可。但制定美國國策之官員，則對蔣主席改組後之政府，仍未　表贊成，尤其是馬歇爾國務卿反對將全數一次貸予中國。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕國務院本日宣佈。中國即將與美方開始解決十五億十美元租借法案債務，與一九四二年五億貸款以及其他戰時帳目之談判，唯尙未決定確切之日期。國務院對華作五億政治貸款時，其歸還之條款以及使借款轉爲長期公債之辦法，均未經規定。據國務院人士稱：解決此項借款之條款，不致過於嚴厲。國務院宣稱：對華租借帳目解決協定之條款，將興其他國家同樣開明，尤其於聯合王國相似英國租借帳目達三百十億美元减去反租借帳目，及其他美國應負之義務外凈償數額爲二百五十億美元，其解決方法為英方償還六億五千萬元，約合每一美元償還二分半。中美之談判，並涉及戰時兩國政府之其他財政義務，包括尙未調整之戰時剩餘物資交易之情形，以及戰時所發生之其他財政要求等。去年六月，雙方已就租偕問題簽訂兩項協定，其一規定償付兩項以及日本投降後民用油管轉讓事宜，另一爲去年六月後於限定時期內制定限定給付軍用租借帳目之條款。然二項條款內，無一係關於一九四二年六月二月互助協定中解決租借帳目經濟事項之問題，以及與戰事帳目有關之一般問題。剩餘物資價値九億元，已以二億一千萬元之謂售於中國，其中一億二千萬元，已由美國爲維持駐華美軍之費用，而與中國所負之義務相抵消，中國並同意五千五百萬元以中國法幣支付，內三千五百萬元作爲美國購置並改進美政府在一華產業之需，叧二千萬元，作爲文化敎誦計劃之經費。</p>

<h3>社論　五四的精神</h3>
<p>—並祝上海文藝作家協會成立—</p>
<p>民國八年的五四運動到今天是二十八年了。二十八年，將近一代，當年的五四靑年，至今鬚髮已白，老將至矣！今天，我們來紀念此一偉大的運動，憧憬過去景象，環顧現在局勢，展望未來進程，感慨無限！</p>
<p>五四運動，不僅是學生運動，政治運動，而且是一次偉火的敎育運動。在我國近代史上，它是劃時代的運動。五四巨潮的掀起，由於第一次世界大戰後，四月的巴黎和會，對於中國山東問題，日本代表作了欺騙的諾言，口頭上允許：山東的軍事政治，可以交還中國，惟經濟除外。美總統威爾遜受了騙，中國南北政府代表受了騙，正準備簽字的時候，中國的靑年學生怒吼了。五月四日恰好是星期日，由北京大學發起，聯合中等以上學校，舉行一次大會，並結隊遊行示威，口號是『外抗强權，內除國賊。』接着，這巨潮震激了全國靑年學生和工人都起來，參加這一愛國運動，從單純的學生運動，變質而爲一種政治運動。因無積極的政治目標，發展不久，乃又由政治運動，轉變而成爲文化運動，新思潮運動，在中國近代史上成爲最富有敎育意義的，劃時代運動。</p>
<p>五四運動到今天已二十八年，回憶二十八年前的景象，事事物物，頗多與今天的局勢相似：第一，廿八年前正是第一次世界大戰結束，我國參戰勝利之時，當時我國以戰勝國不能復興，國際上挺不起胸膛，所以巴黎和會，我們受到很大的欺辱；第二，民國肇基，國內戰禍不已，南北有政府，封建仍割據，以致官吏食汚，政治腐敗，所以學生不滿現狀；第三，學生受着落伍的敎育，缺少新思潮的輸入，缺少科學的知識，所以靑年學生，由思想苦悶。而萌生怨惡：第四，廿八年前，日本國際環境比我們好，英法同她有密約，在外交上事事欺壓我們，日本的意圖，不僅要蠶食山東，並且要吞併東北。而在今天呢？世界又經過一次大戰，我們曾經抗戰八年，我們已是勝利國的地位，日本則已無條件投降，環顧現在的局勢，我們國家的地位，似乎很優越，日本已經下沉，然展望前程，暗礁甚多。至於說到學生運動，從五四到今天，學生運動的性質和形勢，儘管有不同，但其情緒及發展，始終澎湃高漲，且有過於五四時代者。</p>
<p>看今天的日本。在形勢上，日本是戰敗了，無條件投降了，恭順服從聯合國的管制。實質上，日本人的頑固思想，沒有多大的改變。四月選舉，保守勢力依然强大，五月三日實施新憲法，表面文章是民主，心機如何？尙不可測。日本人對中國，並無多大好感，日本人對麥帥，則卑禮屈節，處處討好美國。最近決定保持日本一九三〇至三四的工業水凖，恢復其貿易，增加其生產，足以證明美國的優待日本。美國這種作風，顯然另有國際目標：然日本的重起，最後必興東亞的干戈，此非中國之福，此非亞洲和古之福！</p>
<p>再看今天的學生運動，在理路上，學生運動本是社會運動的一環，並與文化運動同一原流，它與時代進化，相因相成的。環顧現階段的學生運動，幾次的愛國護運動，無不轟轟烈烈，與五四運動相比較，誠有過之無不及。所以在今天，我們不能不指出，五四運動，是中國學生所創造的光榮偉業；五四的時代雖已過去，但五四的精神，至今持續不絕，並將發揮光芒，是値得我們珍重的。但是五四時代的環境，今天仍然存在，是値得我們警惕的。</p>
<p>此外，我們還要鄭重指出，五四運動的本質，不僅是一種政治運動，而且是一種新文化運動，最初發韌於新文藝運動。上海文藝作家協會特定於今日成立，實含有重大的意義。今天我們紀念五四運動，同時並祝上海文藝作家協會成立！</p>

<h3>美蘇聨會本月廿日重開　談判韓國統一問題　馬歇耳覆函申明美國立塲　並將副本分別送達在英兩國政府</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二日電〕馬歇爾已接受莫洛托夫之建議，定本月二十日在漢城這開美蘇聯合委會，俾成立臨時韓國民主政府，但馬氏曾請求蘇方闡明聯合委會將來恢復其工作時所根據之基礎。馬氏今日之覆函中，曾提及蘇外長之聲明，即聯合委會之工作，將根據「純爲實行莫斯科協定關於朝鮮者之基礎」。馬歇爾爲避免將來對此語發生誤會，特吿莫洛托夫謂，聯合委會組織臨時政府時，美方將不拒絕韓國任何民卞黨派或社會團體，供委員會之諮商，從而組織臨時政府。馬氏並對其四月十八日致莫氏函中所云，美國對韓國所特立塲之語句，加以明白闡述，謂聯合委會應依照莫斯科協定加速其工作，而以尊重言論自由之民主權利爲基礎。馬氏謂，任何黨派不應以其目前或過去對將來韓國政府之意見而遭拒絕。馬氏曾請莫洛托夫對兩國在此點上已相互同意一節，早日裁答，俾着手準備召開會議。按馬氏致莫氏函曾分別抄送中英兩國。國務院稱，希望五月二十日會期可能獲得決定。馬氏檢討莫洛托夫對莫斯科協宛有關韓國部份所提出之三點時，渠同意（一）韓國臨時民主政府之建立，應依照各民主黨派社會團體廣泛參加之基礎，且韓國應不受外力控制，並爲聯合國會員。（二）中央省級及各地方民主政府機構之設立，應以自由選舉方式抉擇。（三）美國對韓國經濟復員計劃，敎育及政治之發展計劃，已在老慮中，故歡迎蘇聯保證對韓國恢復爲一民卞國，及在發展其經濟與文化中允予協助。</p>

<h3>吉田稱頌新憲　呼籲日人「諒解」</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京三日電〕日首相吉田今晨宣佈新憲法正式實行，並謂新的日本，已於今日誕生，深望全國人民，咸抱樂觀態度，共同協力，重建祖國。吉田稱，新憲法夫定日本放棄發動戰爭之權利，且至少在理論上剝奪日皇之神聖權利，實有加以諒解之必要。新憲法之精神，若能滲入全國人民之生活，則日本必能再生而爲一快樂之國家，對於人類之進步，必大有貢獻云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京三日電〕日本今日實施新憲法，但慶祝之舉因下雨而减色，參加皇宮廣塲之慶祝者僅五千人，日皇裕仁冒雨蒞臨，已在演說終了之後。裕仁僅逗留二分鐘，向羣衆頻頻揮帽，羣衆亦下　脫帽致敬，幷高呼「萬歲」。</p>
<h3>日地方議會選興　保守派勝利</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京三日電〕日本地方議會議員之選舉，已有二四八四名（定額二四九五名）揭曉，計民主黨佔五一七各，自由黨四六九，社會黨四一四，國民協同黨二三三，共產黨三，小黨派一七七，無黨派七七一。如以保守進步分之，則保守系佔一六二二名，進步系僅五六二名。再女性議員總數僅十二十七名。</p>
<h3>蘇對匈牙利　提苛刻要求</h3>
<p>〔聯合社布特佩斯特二日電〕匈牙利某要人今日談稱：蘇聯已要求匈牙利付出戰爭結束時對德國欠款二似美元，據謂此乃德國資產之一部，應歸蘇聯所有。但蘇聯對於戰爭結束時德國對匈牙利各種物品之欠款五億美元，則拒絕加以考慮。內閣昨日舉行緊急會議，討論蘇聯要求及派遣代表赳莫斯科談判之可能性，朱有決議。</p>
<h3>義國總罷工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦三日廣播，義大利全國各地工人，除交通工人外，約共六百萬人，爲抗議五一勞動節西西里屠殺案，於今晨十一時起，在共產黨之策動下，實行全國總罷工。</p>
<h3>法閣潮形勢嚴重　內閣命運今日可決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎二日電〕法議會定於四日上午十時表決賴瑪迪總理聯合政府之信任案，本晚有各種跡象表示在閣潮嚴重之際，或將與共產黨獲致某種妥協辦法。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎二日電〕社會黨與共產黨就工資物價政策之爭，迄未有解決之望。賴瑪迪總理今夜向議會要求對其工資物價政策投信任票，並當塲表示，如議會與其意見相同，則當繼續執行此一政策；不然即請另以他人担任此項責任。渠並謂共和國已在埀危之中，故盼人人予以協助。觀察家認此不啻爲向共產黨之最後呼籲，，以避免聯合內閣之破裂。共產黨議員迄尙不願表示關於信任表決之意見，預料不論發展如何，共黨閣員當不致辭職。但若星期日以前不獲解決，則賴瑪迪恐不得不提出整個內閣之辭呈。若干觀察家認爲共黨抨擊政府之經濟政策，不過爲一種藉口，共黨之準備退入反對黨陣地，主要動機尙在國際員勞，蓋共黨已認法國之現政府已愈益傾向英美而遠離蘇職故也。</p>
<h3>法請派華工赴越　我政府已予拒絕</h3>

<h3>印荷重開談判</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞三日電〕荷蘭印尼談判已於三日重開，新任命之印尼代表團團員皆未出席，談判共歷數小時，結果未宣佈。</p>
<h3>史達林曾向史泰遜保證　蘇無意向美作戰　謂美蘇可在和洽中生存</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日廣播：史泰遜在莫斯科時，曾于四月九日與史達林作八十分鐘之談話，頃由此間予以發表。在談話中，史達林保證蘇聯絕無向美國作戰之意。蘇聯元首並稱：「茍雙方具有合作之誠意，則美蘇經濟制度雖有不同，但仍可在和洽中生存。史達林强調原子能國際管理，必須書立，其用于戰爭之可能性，必須予以禁絕」。蘇領袖談話內容其他要點如次：（一）雙方互以宣傳作攻擊，不能造成合作；（二）原子管理問題，雖有異議，但終必獲得解決；（三）歐洲目前之慘劇，厥爲原料及食糧之匱乏；（四）美國目前毋庸憂慮。美國旣有兩洋爲之保護，其南北隣國（加拿大與墨西哥）亦係弱國，其安全絕對不受威脅。</p>
<h3>法國擬在遠東　設立海軍基地　越南新政治計劃草擬中</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社西　三日電〕法國海軍部長饒蓋特昨夜透露：渠正考慮建築一設備良好的海軍基地，庇護法國遠東艦隊。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢三日電〕法國陸長弗洛萊，海長饒蓋特及海軍參謀長勒蒙納，在越南視察畢事，已於今晨離此飛返巴黎。</p>
<p>〔路透社西貢二日電〕此間法當局正在擬具越南之新政治計劃，擬使全部政極早日移交安南人之手。安南人多屬越北東京安南兩省之居民，乃越盟民族遝動之先鋒。根據新計劃，安南，東京，交趾支那，柬埔寨及老撾，均將保持個別行政機構，法國之任務僅以維護法國人民之商務及個人利益爲限。此一新計劃不復稱越南爲聯邦國，僅稱之爲法國之聯合國，對法國得以樹立直接條約關係。聞法政府不久即可與柬埔寨及老撾簽訂給予此等新政治地位之條約。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢三日電〕法文「南方報」今日載稱：順化方面已設立越南新政府，該一政府不擬要求法國承認，以待獲得廣大民衆之擁護，此訊是否確實，尙待證實。</p>

<h3>美國援士計劃剖視</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>美國國會一旦批准了杜魯門總統所提貸與土耳其一億五千萬美元的請求，土耳其將變成防止蘇聯勢力伸張至中東的一個堅強的前進基地。這筆款子的主要用途，是在軍事設施和戰略改進方面。</p>
<p>人力配備望于常惡劣的土耳其國防，應使其近代化，以便分出一部份兵員担任民間工作。土耳其的海口，鐵路。公路和飛機塲，爲了要配合大規模的軍事行動，非加以改進不可。要使土耳其的鋼鐵和煤能够自給自足，　的鋼鐵和燃料工業需要更好的設備。</p>
<p>美國的此項大刀闊斧的計劃，使土耳其官方甚至英國政府爲之詫異不置。無怪倫敦和安卡拉的官方要稱道美國的此項建議爲「革命的」措置，一定能在地中海，近東和中東的外圍發生效力。</p>
<p>土國需要精神援助</p>
<p>土耳其現在的局面對於精神上的援助和軍事配備的需要，比較金錢更爲迫切。自從歐戰結束以後，土耳其始終受着蘇聯的壓力，迫使它將接連黑海和地中海的韃靼尼爾海峽的特權讓與蘇聯。蘇聯同時施用下列種種壓力：正式的要求，報紙及無綫電對土政府的攻擊，以及土耳其應將東部卡爾斯及亞達罕兩省割與蘇聯的建議。土耳其須維持一百萬左右的陸軍，約爲全人口的百分之四。軍費一項幾乎佔了土耳其預算的百分之六十。因此土國的經濟資源的基本改進，就不得不延擱下來。</p>
<p>共產政黨並不存在</p>
<p>去年的選舉承認了一個反對黨，這在土耳其近代史上尙屬創舉。但外長薩卡依舊留任，表示土耳其拒絕蘇聯要求的決心，並沒有因選舉而改變。土耳其國內沒有共產黨，同時左派的活動，因政府監視綦嚴，實際上無法施展。</p>
<p>土耳其並不像希臘那樣瀕於財政上的危機。土耳其預算的支出數目不大，儘可藉內償以為彌補。最近土耳其通貨的貶値使輸出額大見增高。美國是土耳其的最大主顧，英國次之。土耳其有黄金準備，自大戰發生以來，共獲得美國貸款四千萬元，供購買工業設備，剩餘物資及商船之用。</p>
<p>英國停止對土耳其的援助，不致發生重大的經濟上的影響。英國於一九三九年根據英法與土耳其所訂盟約，曾貸給土耳其四千萬美元，此項借款土耳其並未延期償付。英國在戰時以信用貸款方式供給土耳其以値價一億美元之軍火。大戰發生以後，英國迄未貸款與土耳其。事實上英國因未支付在倫敦之金鎊差額而對土耳其負欠債務？撇開政府上的援助不談，英國戰後對土耳其的最大貢獻，便是軍事使節團的派遣，該團原有官員三十三人，今已增至六十人。</p>
<p>美國援土分期進行</p>
<p>美國援土計劃將逐漸進行，直到危機解除時爲止。所有款項並不立刻一次交付。照目前計劃，先將軍事設備供給土耳其，以減省從事國防工作的人力。土國需要雷達，高射礟，馬達車輛，坦克車，海岸巡邏船，運輸機和戰鬥機。若干輕型船舶可加改造，以增强土耳其海軍章力。航空站必須重行佈置，使適於夜間降落及重轟炸機降落之用</p>
<p>土耳其士兵訓練將興軍事設備的接濟同時進行。美國軍事使節團將以軍事技術訓練土耳其人，使其能使用現代軍器。此外並有人建議以改進基本工業及交通設施的機器供給土耳其</p>
<p>改進計劃範團甚廣</p>
<p>土耳其早擬向美國吿貸五億美元借款，可是在杜魯門總統宣佈他的新政策以前，土耳其獲得鉅額借款的希望是很渺茫的。土耳其人有意改進黑海沿岸的桑古達克和特萊比桑兩個海口，他們欲把土京安卡拉至伊斯坦部爾的鐵路改成雙軌，舊的車輛更換新的，把鐵路綫延長到伊拉克和伊朗。他們希望增加安卡拉·伊斯米爾·和阿丹那地方的水電供給量，並改良煤礦和鋼鐵廠的機器。</p>
<p>美國援助土耳其的步驟，擬就援土計劃中對於國防上最念切的部分先行實施。土耳其如能獲得更多的貸款，還希望更換破舊的紡織機器，建築新公路並擴大漑灌面積。</p>
<p>抵抗蘇聨土具決心</p>
<p>土耳其是蘇聯邊境最堅强的反共國家，與希臘同樣應得美國的支持，這是美國援土計劃的基本戰略。土耳其人相信：美國宣佈援土計劃以後，已使土耳其對抗蘇聯的立塲增强不少。土耳其希望在物資源源而來時，把它的龐大的陸軍復最一部份。當全部計劃完成時，土耳其將變成對抗蘇聨未來威脅的一個堅强的軍事根據地。（譯自「世界報吿」週刋）</p>
<h3>五強車事參訂委員會　第一次報告發表　蘇與其他四強意見懸殊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山三日廣播：聯合國五强軍事參謀委員會第一次報言內容已發表，關於紐織世界警備　之大綱共四十一條，其中三份之一，均爲蘇聯所反對。此項報吿槪略共八十頁，爲一個月來秘密討論之結果。法國在三點上與蘇聯表示一致，中英兩國則與美國之意見曾同。報吿將由安理會加以討論，其內容揭露結果，證實蘇聯與各强之意見，相去甚遠。蘇聯認爲聯合國憲章中並無明文規定任何國家爲聯合國軍力設立基地，中英美則謂若無萊地，則建立警備軍亦屬徒然。蘇聯要求所有聯合國軍力在完成任務後於三十日至九十日內退回本國領土。其他各強表示反對，此外尙有數點，蘇聯之意見亦不能與其餘各國相吻合。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖三日電〕據此間今日透露：五强已同意以「訓練最精配備最優」之武裝力量撥作聯合國之全球警察力。然蘇聯與西方各國關於聯合國和平維特國之原則，在意見上相距甚遠。聯合國軍力談判之完全取得協議，可能尙需數月，甚至數年之久。此種談判乃在十五個月前聯合國軍事參謀會議始。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京三日電〕東京西北琦玉縣一工廠，被竊毒藥鏞化鉀卅六公斤一事，已引起東京人民之極大恐慌。警察方面深恐竊賊已誤將此毒藥爲麵粉出售，卅六公斤之錆化鉀，可毒斃全部東京市民，東京衛生當局已動員挨戶搜査。同時復設立兩　騐站，几麵粉在製作前須先送往該處試騐，全市麵包商在製作麵包前，須先將麵粉分析。衛生當高爲預防竊賊已將毒藥傾入河道計，故每隔三小時必試騐河永一次，東京警察及衛生當局雖竭力搜査，然迄未發現毒藥之踪跡。</p>

<h3>猶太代表僅獲準　列度委員會陳辭　聨大指導委會通過決議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三日電〕聯合國特別大會今日下午四時開會，討諭猶太代表出席問題。指導委會昨夜已以十一票對零，蘇聯波蘭及捷克　權，表決猶太代表不准出席大會，僅准出席委員會陳述意見。此項建識如由大會接受，則將提付五十五國政治委會討論。政治委會現僅有一項議程，即巴勒斯坦調査委會之組織及職權同題，可望於明日開始討論。調査委會成立後，將從事草擬報吿書，提出九月間大會常會審査，並決定處置辦法，據秘書長賴伊稱，猶太人方面已有四個團體要求派遣代表出席發言。</p>
<p>各國意見分歧　我支持美建議</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗洛辛二日電〕關於猶太族是否得參加本屆聯合國特別大會討論之問題，四強意見已呈分裂。英代表賈德幹在指導委會中首先表示阿拉伯國旣已進入特別大會巴勒斯坦問題之充分　論，則在與法並不抵觸之情形下，應許猶太代表列席陳述意見。美代表奧斯汀表示反對，渠認指導委員會應建議全體大會將猶太族之一切要求，交政治委員會，由政治委員會設法使猶太族有陳述意見之適當機會。奧氏復謂猶太族之代表當以猶太公會爲限，其代表亦不代能向全體大會陳述意見。中國表支持美國之意見，然蘇聯代表葛羅米柯則認美代表之意見欠公允，認爲不但應使猶太代表得向全體大會陳述意見，且應由指導委會審查除猶太公會以外其他一切猶太團體之要求。聨合國秘書長賴伊至此亦參加意見，謂過去非聯合國會員國之聲請參加大會，莫不悉遭駁回，如指導委員會建議由全體大會聆非政府團體之意見，實屬破壞成例。波蘭及捷克代表講起發言，均主張使猶太公會代表到席全體大會陳述意見·印度代表艾里則主張不但應使猶太代表以陳述意見，且應使巴勒斯坦居民代表陳述意見。</p>

<h3>谷部長攜方案返京　指數決有條件解凍　擬有具體計算薪給辦法　建議中央核准後實行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會部谷部長正網已於昨夜公畢搭車返京。谷氏連日徵求本市勞資雙方之意見，並與吳市長及吳局長等洽商後，已決定建議中央原則上解凍生活指數。但爲减輕產業界之担負起見，將採取規定基數十足按指數計算，以上則按級遞减之辦法；並已擬定方案多種，附有團表說明，由谷氏携帶返京，呈中央採擇決定。據谷部長吿記者稱：本市工界方面，認爲目前物價上漲，工人生活無法維持，要求解凍生活費指數，最低限度亦必須有條件解凍指數。本日復經約集工商界領袖商討，對工人生活困苦，亦表同情。惟表示工業界本身之不景氣，危機亦極嚴重，希望政府能注意維護產業及安定工人生活，兼籌並顧。關於解凍指數問題，勞資雙方意見，原則上已趨一致，現經與吳市長吳局長研究解凍後之技術問題，亦已決定初步具體辦法。惟凍結指數，係屬中央決策，未經中央核准，地方無法變更，日內將由市府會同本部，建議中央，深信保障工人生活，原爲政府旣定國策，對此項建議，最短期間，諒能採納實施。</p>
<p>勞資評斷會小組會　擬就具體辦法多項</p>

<p>底薪基數　傳為卅元</p>
<p>據吳局長吿記者：小組會參照工業協會，市商會，總工會三方面之意見，擬定方案，決定自五月份起有條件解凍指數，待中央核准後即可公佈。</p>
<p>據悉：所謂「有條件」，即爲底薪在規定基數以下按指數實給，其超過規定基數之部份，按照指數另打一折扣實發。該項底薪蔭數，在工人方面，可能以卅元爲起點。其所以如此決定者，係爲顧及一部份資方之負祖能力，使不致因驟然解凍，增加工資，而不勝負擔。</p>

<p>記者旋往訪社會局吳局長徵詢工人要求自四月份起解凍指數之意見，吳局長答稱：法律不咎旣往，本人負責於五月份起解決此一問題。如工人定欲自四月份起實行，則決不受威脅云云。</p>

<h3>產業界代表　舉行談話會　認外滙原料難得　為物價上漲癥結　同情工人待遇應予調整</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會部谷部長爲明瞭當前產業界實際情形起見，特於昨晨在社會局會議室召集各工業同業公會談話。到有電工器材業，造紙業，紡織業，橡膠等業負責人四十餘人。席間谷部長闡述三點：（一）積極發揮各業本身力量，以保障前途並謀取發展。（二）當彰經濟困難，必須政府與人民，勞方與資方，工人同合作，以打破難關。（三）勞工問題正由政府研究對策，以求社會安定。繼由各業代表就當前物價，工資，組織，業務各點，廣泛交換意見，對外匯與輸入管理，工資調整，官僚資本利用特權，搗毁經濟等問題，揭述至爲詳盡。大多認爲工業界不能直接取得外匯以購買所需原料材料，實爲當前工業界最大困難，並爲物價上漲之最大癥結。對於工人工資問題，多認爲自指數凍結至今，已與物價脫節甚遠，影響工作效率及引起社會不安現象，故應予合理調整。</p>
<p>谷部長結論七點</p>
<p>最後由谷部長作結論稱：（一）檢舉官僚資本利用特權非法取得外匯。（二）不加入公會者應依法停止營業，此點應由社會局嚴格執行。（三）保護工業，禁止以暴力破壞生產事業。（四）發揚民主精神，貫澈民主作風，以爭取本身利益，監督官吏，以自己力量保障自己利益。（五）工業會法必須本以往一貫主張，完成立法程序，以應需要。尤希工商合作，以發生相輔相成的作用。（六）失業工人問題應請廠方與政府合作，以謀取解決之道。（七）工業團體按月舉行會報，甚爲必要。京滬咫尺，本人甚願常能參加，以與各工業家取得聯緊。談話會至一時許方吿結束</p>
<h3>區政座談會第二日　談話中心為糧腐女房租等問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會分區區政座談會，昨爲第二日繼續舉行，仍由潘議長主持，計出席嵩山。蓬萊。盧灣及邑廟等四區之區民代表會主席，正副區長，及各該區產生之市參議員等十七人。談話中心，計有下列數項問題：</p>
<p>糧食輸入·應予考慮</p>
<p>（一）抑平物價問題：代表等認爲市府採用拋售米糧，以期抑平米價之措施，暫不如採用計口授糧之方法，則小民較可直接蒙受利益。當經潘議長表示當局亦已考慮及此，繼有施參議員宗德即席大聲疾呼，謂：輸入管理委員會第二次限額分配表內，米與小麥之限額僅七百萬美金，而烟葉有八百萬美金，是何理由？豈謂民食所恃之米麥，不如烟草重要乎？應請中央重加考慮此項限額政策。</p>
<p>房租標準·應重規定</p>
<p>（二）房屋租金問題：亦爲昨日列論之中心，咸感租金標準亟應重加規定，以免糾紛，惟僅作倍數之規定，頗不合理。例如黄浦區之地價及房產，決不能與龍華區之地價相提並論，故依土地法九十七條之規定原則，比較合理，但其規定最高額依利息百分之十計算，尙嫌過高，因戰前上海一般房地產，其租金依年息計，尙不達百分之三四。</p>
<p>私搭棚屋·易釀火災</p>
<p>（三）火災防範問題：南市棚戶衆多，該項棚戶大都用油毛氈作為屋頂，一旦遇火，碎片四飛，即形成不可收拾之局面，施求困難，故欲解決消防問題，禁止私搭棚屋及停乏棚屋執，實為當務之急。並查南市火災發生後，救火龍頭往往放水不能暢達，蓋為自來水公司未能充份供給之故，此點亦應請當局注意斜正。</p>
<p>最後由潘議長表示，各區區民代表會第三次大會，希望均能在本會第三次大會之前召集，俾各參議員得列席聽收各方意見，以便提付本會參考。</p>

<h3>高院提審梅斯伯　被告爭朱營銀行職務　辯稱港幣二萬並非存款</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕「洋老虎」荷蘭人梅斯伯，因其所主持之埃勃斯公司，（在南京路沙遜大厦一一八號房間新豐公司內）有經營黑市外匯，買賣外幣，運反經濟緊急措施方案情事，於三月三日經淞滬警備司令部破獲，將梅拘送地院法辦，業經地院於四月十四日處梅有期徒刑一年，梅不服，上訴高院，而原起訴之地檢處檢察官全甸亦認爲原審判刑太輕，向高院上訴。該案於昨晨九時許在高院審訊，美國駐滬總領事館副領事安德生，法律顧問張天薩，荷蘭總領事密特而登均到庭旁聽，梅之辯護人陳霆銳。蔡汝棟兩律師，及警備司令部延請審查賬目之謝春溥會師均到庭。高院刑庭長劉毓桂，推事王可權，韓述之，檢察官楊瑞成升座刑一庭，即由法警將梅斯伯提案，庭上首詢梅之年齡籍貫，據答五十五歲，荷蘭人，住海格路四三三號，業外匯掮客。劉庭長即吿以今日乃調査證據，你旣提起上訴，檢察官亦同時提起上訴，先請檢察官陳述上訴意旨。</p>
<p>楊檢察官論告</p>
<p>檢察官楊瑞成遂起立稱：上訴理由，已詳上訴書，今扼要加以說明，査二月間因金鈔狂漲，影響物價高漲，政府遂有緊急措施方案之頒布，被吿不遵守法令，依然經營黑市外匯交易，原審認定被告係外籍人士，不諳中國法律，故從輕處刑一年。但査被吿留滬經商甚久，對中國情形殊爲熟悉，故原審之認定，殊不適當，此不服原判者一。又原審認定所經營之外匯，不能視作經濟緊念措施方案中所指之外幣，不予論處，査被吿所經營之外匯，悉以外國貨幣爲標的，其屬於經營外幣，顯無疑義，原審對此，不予論處，亦有未合，此不服原判者二。基上兩點理由，本檢察官認爲原判太輕，應請庭上撤銷原判，更爲適當之判決。</p>
<p>被告否認有罪</p>
<p>嗣據梅斯伯稱：原審法院依經濟緊急措施方案第七條，認定上訴人於二月二十五日收受港幣二萬元，作爲存款論，有經營跟行業務情事，遂遽根據該方案第七條處上訴人徒刑，不知此港幣二萬元並非在款，係顧客與紐約雷峨公司買賣外匯之保證金，交易完畢，仍須退還原主。上訴人僅屬經紀人性質，埃勃斯公司亦從不接受存款，原審以銀行論處判罪，顯有未妥，應請庭上爲諭知無罪之判決。至此，陳霆說律師起立補充，略謂：本案被吿於聲明上訴後，鈞院即時審訊，致上訴理由書未及呈遞，容後補呈。關於本案所引用之經濟緊急措施方案法條，是否已完成立法手續，將來在上訴理由中詳加說明，茲先將事實方面略予補充。原審法院認定被吿經營銀行業務，遽以此加以判罪，要知經濟緊急措施方案所指者爲正式銀行，故其文末，有吊銷執照一語，況被告所收之保證金二萬元港幣，乃與紐約雷峨公司買賣外匯之保證金，原審翻譯錯誤，視作存款，據以判罪，實難甘服。</p>
<p>審查賬目經過</p>
<p>繼由謝春溥會計師起立報吿審査埃勃斯公司賬目經過稱，三月一百晚接警備司令部電話通知査賬，窮三日之力，至六日將報吿製就，所有埃勃斯公司之收支賬目均列表於內，往詢梅斯伯，承認該項報吿書審査正確。陳律師起立詢問謝會計師三點：（一）二萬港幣是保證金，抑係志款？（二）埃斯勃公司內有無銀行性質之存款？（三）埃斯勃公司依會計學觀點論究竟係何種性質之公司？謝會計師稱：（一）經査明二萬港幣是保證金。（二）該公司無銀行性質之存款。（三）該公司未經我國政府註册，係經美國註册，爲一匯票公司，至是否銀行性質，不能斷定。</p>
<p>證言大致相同</p>
<p>嗣傳訊證人管賬員葡人巴勃鐵斯泰，出納員史久森，記賬員邵舜欽，協理葡人康派司，及管易員葡人保太利亞等，證言大致相同。末由陳律師請求停止覊押庭諭須以狀聲請，開合議庭裁定。又要求將被吿仍還押馬斯南路看守所，以便就近送飯，當庭裁准。劉庭長諭：本案定十日上午九時半開言詞辯論庭，屈時審理終結。昨日該案審訊時間達四小時之久，退庭時已一時半。</p>
<h3>僞造交通公司封條　冒充整紮鈔票行騙</h3>
<p>前日嵩山　分局　警査緝至寗海西路鴻運坊南京旅社某號房間內，見有一人，正在封紥鈔票，桌上滿堆「上海市公共交通公司交通組營業所」封條十餘紙，及五十萬一捆之現鈔，上面貼有上項封條，經警員拆開檢點，實數僅僅廿五萬元，中間夾有五百元之小票半數。旋又在其床底下搜出大皮夾一只，內藏西裝料三段，當將其人拘獲。據供名林夢南，廿一歲，浙江人，無業，承認報將此項不足數之鈔票，送往中國銀行儲蓄部活期儲存，因欲避免銀行職員檢點起見，故而粘貼此項封條，詰其此項西裝料從何處購來，答亦係用此方法向某西裝店講得，但店號已經忘却，餘供支吾。林身穿西裝，舉止闊綽，當即連同贓物一併帶入警局，聽候調査，再行解院訊辦。</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律釋疑</p>
<p>（一）解除婚約</p>
<p>宗誠問　舍親某甲女性在七歲時，由父母作主憑媒許配與乙男。當時除交換手飾戒指外，得聘金五十元，今甲女年已廿四，肄業於某大學，因與對方志趣不同，故對此婚約，堅決反對，但不明法律，未敢輕舉妄動，茲擬下列數問題，務請賜答爲感。（一）其本人可否空報聲明宣布此項婚約無效？（二）對方如不同意解約是否妨礙婚姻自主？（三）提議解約人是否要賠償任何損失？（四）聘金應如何償還？（五）對方如有非法要挾如何應付？（六）對方如採取拖延不允解約，女方可否另行擇配，是否違法？（七）此項婚約解決步驟如何？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕父母爲未成年子女訂定婚約當然無效，無待於解除，故（一）可。（二）不礙。（三）一般解除婚約者，無過失之一方，得向有過失之他方，請求賠償其因此所受之損害。（四）可由雙方協議。（五）訴請法院裁判。（六）可。（七）最好託人從中調處。</p>
<p>（二）暗渡陳倉</p>
<p>李治中問　敝人有法律疑問數則，敬祈賜答；甲男已婚，並育有子女，今有同居某君，因家境河寒，時向甲男求助，日久則某君之女逐漸對甲發生好感，後即發生肉體關係，但該女已與丙男訂婚（女年十九歲），現已珠胎暗結。請問（一）某甲之行爲是否觸犯妨害家庭或有傷風化等罪名？（二）丙方能否控甲男以誘姦罪？（三）甲妻願同乙女同居，能否再同丙方解除婚約？</p>
<p>〔傅况鱗律師答〕甲乙通姦，如係乙所主動，固不成爲略誘，如甲無使乙脫離家庭或其他有監督權之人，亦不成立和誘罪，除甲妻得以有配偶與人通姦吿訴外，丙不能控甲，若甲妻對比縱容或宥恕，亦不得吿訴。至乙與丙之婚約，因乙與甲通姦，丙得主張解際，並得請求賠償損失，倘乙主張解除，當得丙之同意，但丙亦不得請求强迫履行。</p>

<h3>黃伯惠遭狙擊案　高檢處發回覆查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前時報館主人黄伯惠被狙擊案，曾經地檢處偵査終結，認爲被吿鄭德昇並無敎唆殺人嫌疑，予以不起訴處分。吿訴人黄伯惠不服，向高檢處申請再議，並提供證據。茲經高檢處偵査完畢，認爲黄伯惠之申請有理由，應重行偵查，全部案卷已於昨日發回地檢處。其理由略謂：吿訴人提出五洲藥房受創頭骨X光照片說明書及張去病醫師診斷結果，認爲吿訴人右側頭部頂骨凹陷骨折可能係槍傷所致，而原偵査中法醫檢驗，謂非槍傷所致，二者出入甚大，應依刑事訴訟法一百九十五條，檢察官可囑託醫院鑑定。同時頗注重吿訴人指出之行兇者蓋司韋脫，高院檢察官認爲蓋確有重大嫌疑。按被吿鄭德昇現在押，地檢處將於下週內對該案開始覆査。</p>

<p>昨晚雙方戰來均無以往第一第二兩戰之精采，而靑聯隊員中竟有一日間參加比賽兩塲者，上半時靑聯尙見合作，比分始終接近，下半時即呈不支，而現疲態，故雪白得漸入佳境，終獲勝利。</p>
<p>首開紀錄者爲雪白張秀麗，靑聯孫鳳竹二擲二中，各四平手。五比四時雪白王珊易朱家珍，第一節十四比十三，靑聯領前一分。第二節開始王慧玲打成十五分平手，俄雪白更以十八超出三分，楊堅孫鳳竹頃刻復以廿二比廿再追出，上半時廿四比廿三雪白勝一分。</p>

<h3>港籌賬綱球賽　蔡惠全敗績</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕籌賑英國水災之網球表演賽，由我國前臺杯選手蔡惠全對新膺全港單打冠軍葉觀雄，廿八日在本球塲舉行，是日塲地雨濕，未得全乾，且天陰光綫不佳，對老將出賽已失天時地利，是以蔡惠全演來未見理想。</p>
<p>在第一盤裏，雙方苦戰後，葉先勝六比四。第二盤比數成五比五時，裁判見天色低沉，即宣佈再賽三局，誰能勝兩局，即作勝此盤。結果成六比六後，葉觀雄再得一局，遂以直落二勝蔡惠全。</p>
<p>雙打賽，由蔡觀雄，蔡惠全對徐氏兄弟煒培潤培，登塲時，微雨飄飄，觀衆大减失望，當第一盤未分勝負時，大雨已來，於是掃興而散。</p>

<p>确拉士基</p>
<p>謝錦洪　地亞　安達臣　陳利　色曷　依土　　干那士　蕭維路　鄒文治　謝錦河</p>
<p>籃球　越南藍球隊在港原定比賽五塲，二戰對中青後，由於種種誤會的原故，臨時把餘下的秩序——對自力，黑貓，南萊三戰取消。後越南領隊林鷺英以此次歸國，原屬切磋觀光，乃出而折衷調停，比賽遂得繼續舉行，決定先續戰自力。對黑貓，南華之戰則候越除征穗完畢返港時，然後再賽。</p>
<p>自力本爲香港勁旅，但因人事關係，每况愈下，前鋒少去盧振喧，僅得張樹棠活躍，難以取分，後衛陸德彰表演雖好，難反敗局，目下半塲後，調月後備登塲，動搖陣脚，結果爲越隊所乘，以三十比四十敗北。計越隊在港三戰，成績兩勝一敗。</p>

<h3>國家行局各地滙率　明日起予以調整</h3>
<p>滙額可望放寬審核手續加嚴</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市四行兩局一庫匯往各地匯款匯率，自五月五日起，又將大批調整。據悉：此緣近來廣州法幣大批走私香港，套取港幣，購訂外貨。一方面又有若干商業行莊，利用國家行局之低匯率，從事套匯取巧。聞各商業行莊匯往各地匯率，夏門泉州每千元一九〇元，福州六〇元，廣州交現者二三〇元，劃帳者一七五元。汕頭一八〇元至二〇〇元。漢口九五元。重慶廿五元。關係方面吿記者：近來黑市外匯飛漲，與官價相差日鉅，僑匯逃避情形，又日吿嚴重，無形中又增加鉅額法幣之需要量。深望政府對僑匯應覓求切實解決辦法。至國家行局此次調整各地匯率，目的在杜絕商業行莊套匯取巧。目前所取之對策，爲加嚴審核手續，惟匯額則予放寬。如各商業行莊能申述理由，列舉事實，無不准予調撥。茲將調整後之匯往各地匯率，分誌如次：</p>
<p>廈門每千元八〇元，（原爲四五元），福州六〇元，（原爲四〇元），福建區其他各地八〇元，（原爲四五元）。廣州九五元，（原爲七五元），汕頭九五元，（原爲八〇元），廣東區其他各地九五元，（原爲八〇元）。靑島二元，（原爲五元），山東區其他各地五元，（原爲十元）。廣西區小數五〇元，（原爲三〇元）。</p>
<p>長沙七〇元，（原為五五元），衡陽七〇元，（原爲五五元），湖南區其他各地七〇元，（原爲五五元）。河南區七〇元，（原爲五五元）。南通六元，（原爲八元）。蕪湖二〇元，（原爲一五元）。</p>
<p>漢口，武昌六五元，（原爲五〇元，沙市，宜昌七〇元，（原爲五五元），湖北區其他各地七〇元，（原爲五五元）。贛州，南昌，九江均二〇元，（原均一〇元），景德鎭及江西區其他各地均二〇元，（原均一五元）。杭州三元，（原為二元）。</p>
<p>重慶二〇元，（原為二元），成都二〇元，（原爲五元），叙府三〇元，（原爲一〇元），萬縣三〇元，（原爲八元），四川區其他各地二〇元，（原爲一〇元）。貴州區二〇元，（原爲五元）。雲南區二〇元，（原爲五元）。</p>
<h3>統債靜極思動　丙種漲三千二</h3>
<p>公債昨買戶靜極思動，向榮之心理又股。統丙晨開一六三〇〇元，自一五九〇〇元起，逐漸拉高至一九二〇〇元，而後轉盤。五一二室五〇三室二五一室五五〇室俱進，三六〇室先出後進，寳隆潤德有售。結果較前收計甲乙丁戊各升一千六及一千八不等，統丙獨漲三千二。</p>
<h3>外股走勢績俏</h3>
<p>外股昨續吿走俏，洋商及廣帮分購會德豐及英聯，證券幫出怡紗而扒轉業廣，以致業廣等小股漲勢見勁。怡紗晨開七一六〇〇元，即吿盤上，午刻申電有報縮之說，漲到七四四〇〇元而後轉盤。結果較前收計業廣紙業鋼業各漲成半左右，英聨怡紗航業墾植開平各升一成光景，餘升半成</p>
<h3>人造絲略挫</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲因同行中軋銀根關係，開盤即小，一二〇號高山有光先喊一千七百萬元，後六百八十萬元成交一箱，但因喊價過小，一度有買無賣，於是喊價又漸上升，卒做八百二十萬元收盤。下午仍喊上午收盤價，結果比上日短八十萬元。七五號金鷄半光因貨缺喊價堅持。廠經實銷有限，昨價各擋均短五六十萬元不等。D字等級做價二千萬元，E字等級一千九百五十萬元，干經五祖有單子貨價做一千六百五十萬元。綢貨昨市大都穩定，格子璧縐先做三萬四千元，後做四千五百元，只人絲貨華錦縐羽紗等，因原料稍回，昨亦短五百元之譜</p>
<h3>棉紗議價小組　尚在搜集資料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會議價小組會，於昨日上午十時，假中國紡建公司召開會議。到委員吳味經，劉淸基，紡管會劉文騰，王子建等，當以民營紗廠方面，尙未能提出計算生產成本之資料，議價無從進行。當決定於明日上午十時，由民營紗廠先搜集資料，議就成本表，然後再召開議價小組會討論云。</p>
<h3>黑市價格極混亂　米商提兩點要求</h3>
<p>請求恢復白米自由買賣</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米問題仍極嚴重，各米號除經售政府之配米外，多無貨應市。黑市價格謠傳紛紜，極爲混亂。市民無處購米，頗感恐慌。米商因運米困難，沿路宵小乘機敲詐，且有被搶可能，乃多不敢運米，怨聲載道，寗可不做交易。兩市塲昨共祗到九〇四百，白元做廿六萬五千元。社會局仍拋白米九千包。</p>
<p>市長改期明日談話</p>
<p>昨日下午三時，吳市長召集米商代表談話。是時米業負責人適被米商包圍於市塲，無法脫身，祗胡咸鋼一人前往，談話遂吿流產。吳市長乃改期五日上午八時半再談。而聚於市塲之米商經集會決定，推派瞿振華等七人前往市府晋謁市長，提出兩點要求：（一）市府所拋售之米，由各區區公所另行指定地點出售。（二）恢復白米自由賣買。當代表趕往市府時，市長適已公出。乃轉往社會局與糧食科長吉明齋商定，於五日（星期一）上午八時半再往晋謁吳市長。</p>
<p>恐演打店懼售配米</p>
<p>據米業代表稱：各米號因見杭州打米店之風潮大起恐慌。爲避免危險起見，故要求市府配售之米由各區區公所另行指定地點出售，各米號願派員義務協助。至要求恢復自由賣買一點，因鑒於目前當局之限價政策，爲米號有米時不肯寬放，待賣光後姶放鬆一步。如是使來源枯竭，而米商之資金亦日漸短少。人民無米可購，更造成恐慌現像。故要求從速准予恢復自由賣買。</p>
<p>雜糧食淮盤旋局面</p>
<p>麵粉昨成堅定之格，麩皮去化轉暢，回升二千元，忽上忽落。</p>
<p>豆餅交易重見熱閙，疲而復振，挺升二三千元，亦成乍升乍降之象。油市店胃轉旺，回漲二三萬元，亦然兎起體落，聞靑島亦將開禁，配油正在辦理，趨勢盤旋之局。</p>
<p>黄豆來去兩稀，無榮無辱。菉豆南洋動而不旺，平疲少神。赤豆華南消化淸閒，價形站立。生仁去化活潑，猛進萬元。芝蔴廣消呆滯，狂跌一萬餘元。紅糧似前，苞米成交不多，市勢暫平。</p>
<h3>食糖價續鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市以台糖配售之期已近，惟價格未定，故趨勢雖軟，尙未過跌。如秘魯細砂爲四十二萬元，小八千元，二四粗白小萬元，二〇中砂小一二萬元，四半車白小三萬許，三半軒白降度相仿。土糖微鬆，汕提靑廿七萬元，小五千元。黄江靑廿六萬五千元，漳刁靑廿六萬至二十五萬七千元，小三五千元。興化白四十，一萬五千元，小一萬五千元。次之四十萬元至三十九萬五千元，興化赤三十萬元至二十九萬元，小萬餘元。</p>
<h3>抑平物價</h3>
<p>吳市長訪張總裁</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長於昨日下午五時許，往中央銀行訪謁張總裁，不久國府主計處主計長徐堪亦到，共同會談，前後歷二小時，聞會談內容，與抑平本市一舷物價問題有關云。</p>
<h3>茶市依然黯淡</h3>
<p>專供內銷之紅綠茶，本街及客幫之云化，昨無多大出入。價格方面，則在吐納古衝中，極少變遷。洋莊茶市，若干家出口行對於一部份外銷花色，雖有與貨主磋商，惟雙方喊價難以圓滿，致交易依然黯淡，市勢奄無生氣。</p>
<p>又訊：浙省遂安亦爲豐盛之產茶區，每年行銷國內國外數量均頗可觀。茲據業中人云：彼地毛茶，刻下業已開盤，聞每担爲二十五萬元。</p>
<h3>工業油脂猛挺</h3>
<p>工業油脂，以存底日薄，各皂廠搜購不遺餘力，市價再見高翔。禾本柏油喊六十六萬元，牛油喊八十萬元，略有成交。椰子油一百十萬元，有成交，惟數量甚小，蓋各油行，均已出售一空也</p>
<h3>西藥行市騰漲　具有兩種原因</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據新藥業中人談稱：近來西藥行市騰漲，原因有二：（一）黑市外匯騰漲，商人羣起搜購，價遂愈抬愈高。（二）輸管會發表第二季西藥限額，僅美金六十萬元。且對輸入商資格之規定，須限於去年一年間，輸入西藥金額，在美金十萬元以上。其有經理權者，輸入額需在五萬元以上。而符合該項資格者，十九均屬進進口商行。正式西藥房，去年多直接向美國各大藥廠直接定貨，而各廠以產量少，供給不多，故正式西藥房進口反少。今如輸入之西藥限額，悉入進口商行之手，深恐造成壟斷居奇，無貨應市之惡果。故新藥業上月廿五日會員大會時，曾要求輸管會兩點：（一）更改輸入西藥資格之審核規定，專業合法之藥房，亦應列爲合格之西藥輸入商行。（二）國內不能製造或產量極微之西藥，不應採取限額制度。其他重要藥品，應放寬限額，則西藥行市不難抑平云。</p>
<h3>股市人心脆弱　走勢飄忽靡定</h3>
<p>華股昨雖見平穩，但因人心脆弱屢起屢仆倍形恍惚，中心力量操諸塲外，散戶業已有莫知所從之苦，趨勢更爲不定。</p>
<p>晨初勤與等古古，榮塵等開低較多，迨遞永紗登塲見昂，於是遞交各股咸開高盤。開後九四號二五三號二〇七號一八五號一八六號二一八號二二號二一九號一五二號均進，商務苜先漲停，升爲六二〇〇元。一〇二號八九號三三五號一四二號來賣，一〇六號二一九號進後有售，而回降至六〇五〇元左右。一〇二號一〇五號七七號四號九一號一〇五號九四號一五三號八九號來納，九福亦吿迫停，升爲六二三〇元。一五二號一四五號二三號一七七號一八三號有售，散戶忽起恐慌，榮豐跌停而回落至六〇三〇元低價。一七八號二號一四號二三號進至六二〇〇元外，一五一號亦來補進，乃將遞永紗扳高至六三〇〇元高價。一〇五號一八五號一五四號七六號　七號尙有供給，復回降至六一〇〇元光景。一四五號一四八號四號一五二號一二九號來買，美亞由一一二號掛高至漲停而仍穩。午刻在六二〇〇元內外徘徊，收後二二三號脫售而迫低至六一〇〇元內，聞夜報有借款消息也。結果較前收計永紗平平，信和美亞華豐升半成，新光中法跌半成弱，景福微升，永公勤興稍跌，新華跌一成弱。遞交永紗華豐景福各升半成左右，勤興跌半成，永公微降，信和新光略升，美亞漲停。冷股計商務九福漲停，火柴漲停後有回，升半成。榮豐跌停後有回，跌半成强。中紡統益平平，大通漲一成强，水泥跌一成弱，餘股榮辱俱微。場外各股漲風仍烈，升一成至一成不等，中華漲風最烈。</p>
<h3>金菜貨稀軋升</h3>
<p>金針菜近以存底漸稀，而產價步緊，鎭江曾由四十七八萬元升至六十四萬元，由市高貨行盤售七十五萬元次照减，市象穩定。</p>
<h3>銀樓業代表　請國行配售原料</h3>
<p>或對收兌價格不作硬性規定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀樓業代表吳彭年·姚桂卿？裘雲艮·馮淸庵等四人，於昨日下午四時許，往謁中央銀行張總裁，當由劉副總裁代爲接見。各代表等提出二點：（一）望國行配售金條金塊等原料，（二）如不能配售，則對銀樓業收進兌出之價格，勿作硬性規定。劉氏當表示，願代爲轉達張總裁。惟稱：此事國行亦不能決定，尙須請示行政院財政部云。</p>
<p>據銀樓業中人談：銀樓業過去出售金飾，對調劑農村金融，不無帮助。蓋農民常以所得，儲購金飾，茲因無從兌購金飾，乃羣趨購買日用品，亦足促成日用品之漲風。又該業現決於最近，分函京·蘇·錫·常·九江·長沙。重慶等地銀樓業，派遣代表，來滬召開全國銀樓業代表大會，俾便決定該業今後動向，聞將集體晋京請願云。</p>
<h3>煤價獨平</h3>
<p>煤市本週過程尙稱平靜，白煤塊上檔貨來源不多，市勢較爲俏俐。中下檔貨，不合滬地實銷，去路較呆。烟煤廠商自行採購，雖經核准，然因煤源有限，且目前滬地廠銷不振，業中人仍似無多大興趣，行市亦無甚軒輊。焦炭贛漢來貨尙績，滬地納胃亦盛。市况平定，萍薌焦行市，穩站九十五萬至一百萬元之間。柴炭因產地辦價受米價上漲影響，致市價略見帶升。</p>
<h3>肥皂市貨稀少　廠方持貨不放</h3>
<p>肥皂市貨極度稀少，客埠以皂價扶搖直上，紛紛來滬採辦。皂廠以目前市塲所售價格尙不敷製造成本，致甚少出籠，而原料來源旣少存底又薄，最近油脂與燒碱純碱激漲達一倍半以上，皂價上漲尚不到一倍，倘客羣再予大量收講，則皂價將再度激升。</p>
<h3>農行召集會議　推進本年繭貸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國農民銀行爲討論推進本年春繭貸款問題，曾於日前召集該行蘇·錫·常·杭等地分支行處負責人，及各地繭行代表會議，當決定：（一）請蠶絲產銷協導委員會報吿各繭行核貸數額，待陳准四聯總處後，即行核貸。（二）浙東蠶繭上市較早，爲避免侷促計，決先由中蠶公司杭州分公司，向杭州中農行先貸借廿億元，核貸予各　行，該貸款由浙江建設廳擔保，將來再在春繭貸款總額中扣除云。</p>
<h3>桐油運輸問題</h3>
<p>輸廣會設法解決</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，於昨日上午十一時，在中央銀行舉行第九次會議，到主委，張嘉璈，副主委陳光甫。委員劉攻芸，金士宣，沈熙瑞，顧問李銳，白益恩，馬格，決議要案多件，聞由渝運滬桐油，以輪船缺乏噸位，及武漢等地儲藏設備不足，該會正力謀解決，除已函重慶船舶調配委員會設法外，並由桐油小組加以研究。再桐油走私香港，日見嚴重，損失外匯，爲數甚鉅，聞該會業已商決對策，正轉呈行政院核示中。</p>
<p>又訊：中國植物油料廠上月份中桐油出口者爲一千七百噸，成交者爲六百四十噸。又一月份至三月份出口部份爲三千噸，成交部份爲三千〇五十噸。該公司在香港辦理出口者，一月份至三月份出口部份爲七千噸，其他各行在香港出口者爲七千六百噸。又悉：上海其他方面，尙有經營桐油出口行商十餘家，如中信局沈源來南洋公司及義瑞等，一月份至三月份出口數量爲三千五百噸。桐油爲我國出口主要物資，居國際貿易重要地位，數月以來，輸出數量不多。據業中人談其原因不外（一）產地價高，運輸困難，每市擔上海市價計國幣四十五萬元，每磅約合美金三角七分。（二）海外價跌，每磅美金兩角七分，形成倒琉。（三）海外存貨甚豐，即以美國論，據估計總量可敷十個月之用。餘如我國幣値不能穩定，國外商人惕惕惕不安，產地商人又奇貨可居，以致構成此種不良現態。</p>
<h3>燒堿價混亂</h3>
<p>一月以來，燒碱市價，由三百五十萬元激升至八百萬元左右。砟市以日來黑市外匯狂升，國外價格報升，紗廠，皂廠紛起扒吸，原料商執貨不多，散戶不特不肯吐售，反衞盡情搜買，故竟乏做開，喊價混亂異黨，市上籌碼，頗爲枯竭。</p>
<h3>改進許昌菸葉　經取締者十之九</h3>
<p>許昌菸葉改進工作，經農林部菸產改進處許昌菸葉改良塲陳塲長，與地方各機關聯推動後，頗著成效。蘿葉曾經取締者已十之八九，並經懲德豐等行三十四家取締雜菸，共計九八六〇磅，照章科罰國幣一一，一九〇，〇〇〇元，該款由各菸行逕送縣銀行，專戶儲存。並擬定雜菸取締委員會之組織條例及檢查人員服務規則兩種，將來擬於各主要產菸縣份如許昌，襄城，禹縣，郟縣，長葛，臨穎，葉縣等處，依據寶際　要情形，酌設取締所五至七處，一俟昆山壽措及人事佈置就緒，即可成立。</p>
<h3>鮮肉價狂漲</h3>
<p>日來陰雨多日，猪隻來源减少，產地頻頻上漲，本市昨日鮮肉拆價每百斤已騰至五十五萬元，爲本年來第一次之新高價。另售腿肋爲七千元，條肋爲六千元。又訊：日來靑菜，竹笋等價格，較半月以前漲起已達一倍。</p>
<h3>永泰和　調整配價</h3>
<p>本市錢兌莊自當局禁止金鈔買賣後，大多已改營紙烟業，彼等持雄厚資金，向市，拖捲烟，且純視股票以及其他物價爲升沉準繩，不顧實銷，以致促使烟價上漲，漫無止境。今悉：永泰和烟公司爲謀敉平姻市漲風計，聞將大量配售，但配價略予調整，爲大英每箱四百黃莊兇，（增八十萬元），老刀每箱三百廿萬元，（增六十萬元）但較市價仍見低廉云。</p>
<h3>臺省新茶上市</h3>
<p>台北三日電，本省新茶已自淸明前後，絡續上市，省垣茶行均呈活氣，惟運銷省外仍稀。新茶葉價格，較去年稍軟，每百斤的一萬元左右。又舊茶存貨，日漸减少，呈有行無市之狀態。</p>
<h3>印刷業漲價　照舊價加三成三</h3>
<p>本市印刷業同業公會，正式決定於三日起，調整印刷價目，槪照舊價提高三成三計算，書版排工過去每千字一萬八千元，現爲二萬三千九百四十元，書版印工過云每千本三萬八千元，現為五萬零五百四十元。每加一千本過去爲三萬二千元，現爲四萬二千五百六十元。</p>

<h3>參觀廣東西村士敏士廠　華南唯一的水泥供應處</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>廣州十八日航訊</p>
<p>最近得到一位朋友的介紹，到廣東西村士敏土廠（Saichuen　Cement　Works）去參觀，這是華南唯一製造水泥出品的工廠；因爲這也屬於重工業，製造水泥的機器要靠外國運來裝配，所以我國水泥廠根本沒有幾間。記得在戰時的大後方，全國低有重慶一間四川水泥廠，而且規模也不大，每天產量僅有九百桶。到復員後，在華北華中大規模的水泥廠，雖然都已陸續復工了，但在華南方面，到現在還是祗有一間，就是廣東西村士敏土廠；目前粤湘桂幾省需要的水泥，都全靠它來供應的了。　西村，道是廣州市西郊一個地方；那裏樹蔭濃密。　景頗佳。在戰前，廣東建設廳將那塊地方劃爲廣東第一工業區，有一所省立工業專門學校也就在那裏；不過經過幾年的淪陷，我們不少建設都給敵偽破壞得面目全非，現在雖然那個題着「廣東第一工業區」的牌樓，還巍然屹立，但裏面已是一片荒凉；成爲這個工業區的點綴品的，祗有一所飲料廠，一間建設廳的工業化騐所，和士敏土廠等三間，而其中規模較大的，也祗有士敏土廠而已！</p>
<p>滄桑閱畫</p>
<p>這所士敏土廠一向是省營的工廠，開始籌辦於民國十八年八月，負責開辦和建築的工程師是鄧鴻儀，全部機器係向丹麥國斯蔑士（F.L.midth）廠定購，連裝配機器及建築廠塲一共費時三十個月始克完成，到民國二十一年三月才正式成立。廠內比較重要的機器，大的是碎石機，洗泥池，原料磨，熟土磨和燒泥窰等幾個部份，完全都是龐大的機器；其中燒泥窰允爲宏偉，它是一條口徑丈餘，長達二百三十餘呎的大鐵管，而這種窰一共設軒有三條，在這些機件活動之下，每天可以出產水泥三千六百桶（第桶三百四十市斤）。可是，就爲了這些機器過於龐大笨重，致廣州淪陷時無從拆卸下來疏散，又來不及破壞，結果給日本的淺野株式會社用來繼續出產水泥，供應給華南各省淪陷區的日軍建築防禦工事，這眞是我們一種無從計算的損失哩！</p>
<p>復員經過</p>
<p>復員後，這工廠才由建設廳接收過來，仍然派戰前原任該廠的廠長孫滿先生任總經理，來負責籌備復工事宜，但日軍投降時，將該廠破壞得很厲害，所有泥槳池，碎石機，一個二千瓩和一個四千瓩的發電機，都給炸燬；原來的三條燒泥窰有兩條被拆去，現在已經査到一條是搬了去海南島，叧一條則搬到東北去；所以後來經過半年多的時間，才將損壞和缺少的機件慢慢的修復和補充，到去年六月中旬，總算復工了！現在廠內的技工和職員有四百多人，以外還有在他們礦塲採石和運輸的工人二三百人；但因爲現在祗有一條窰，而且還受到煤和電力供應的限制，致目前的產量僅及戰前的三分之一，即是每天可出水泥一千二百桶。</p>
<p>內部一瞥</p>
<p>學我們參觀了廠內各個製造的部門，知道了水泥的製造也並不十分困難的，手續也不算複雜；大概最困難的就是要有那些宏偉機器的設備吧了！製造水泥的主要原料，原來就是我們日常所見的石頭（石膏石），泥巴（山泥和海泥），石膏，和水幾種；它的製造過程大約是這樣：先將碎石放在碎石機內壓碎，一方面將泥巴放在洗泥池洗滌，使之成爲純泥，然後把碎石，泥槳和水混合，放到原料磨去磨，那便變成石泥漿；再將石泥漿放到燒泥那條長窰去用高度的熱力來燒它，那便變成熟土，將這熟土加上相當份量的石膏，再放到熟土磨去把它磨幼，然後稱過重量，加上包封，那便是製成品了！</p>
<p>嫓美英坭</p>
<p>在過去，我們所用的水泥，大半是靠舶來品供應，允以「英坭」爲更著名；但據該廠的孫經理語記者：因爲他們肯悉心研究而且製作不肯馬虎，所以該廠出產的五羊牌士敏土，不單是全國最幼滑精美的水泥，就與舶來品比較，其製鍊精美亦有過之而無不及；同時他們的定價也至便宜，現照他們規定的批發價，是每小包（八十五市斤）國幣一萬八千元，並交由二十一家承銷商代理，規定他們的利潤不得超過百分之二十；而舶來品的市價，起碼每小包也要港幣八元，伸起來還沒有我們便宜；所以他們的出品不祗稽美而且又最便宜的哩！</p>
<p>在建設第一的現階段當中，一切水利工程，橋樑，以至於房屋的建築，水泥實在是最主要的材料；所以它也可算是一種國防工業；當我們參觀完西村士敏土廠後，覺得他們對國家社會的貢獻實在不少；尤其他們那種悉心研究和努力增產的精神，更足使人欽佩的。</p>
<h3>李宗黃演講　基層組織</h3>
<p>— 陳起龍</p>
<p>江寗廿日訊</p>
<p>今天是貴縣幹訓所第五期舉行畢業典禮，兄弟能得此機會，參與其盛，內心深感愉快而興奮！兄弟以畢生精力，致力於下層工作，因爲我的父母是農民，兄弟是來自田間，飮水思原，對農民同胞同志，向來都喜歡接近。所以今天自不能不來。</p>
<p>基層組織的詮釋</p>
<p>什麽是基層組織呢？由廣義說：縣各級都可以說是基層組織，而所謂基層，是對縣以上的省和中央而言。由狹義說：是單指鄕鎭保甲而言。縣的一級係地方自治的主體，所以凡是從事縣政的人員，也就是地方自治工作的人員。其决說到基層組織的性質，及其含義一點，當然政治上的一切措施，不能脫離了「管·敎·養·衛」的範圍，縣旣然同時是地方自治的主體，在一個縣所屬的範圍中，當然具有地方自治團體的性質，依照國父的啓示：「地方自治團體，不僅爲一政治組織，並爲一經濟組織」。由此可見，在這個基層組織中，特別注重民生問題，以政治組織爲手段，以達到經濟組織爲目的。經濟組織，是在基層組織中的重心。在地方自治開始實行法中，有非常詳明的規定，想來諸位都已有充分的認識。在新縣制中所要舉辦的各種農業。工業·交易·銀行·保險等合作社，都是以鄕鎭爲中心，來實施造產。若我們把這政治組織和經濟組織，幹得很好，人民公共所需用的育幼·養老·濟貧·救災，醫藥等，消極方面，就能完滿的達到，積極方面，就可以提高了人民的生活，獲得充分的福利，使社會文化進步，國家民族的基礎鞏固。　由上面我們可以看出，關於基層組織的重要性是如此，我們其次再來從下面所提出的向個問題，再來更進一步的看看。</p>
<p>從中國歷史來看</p>
<p>從中國固有的歷史看，我們的國家，當然是具有綿且着萬古千秋的悠久的生命，但單從有文字的刀載來開始計算，至今約有四五千年的歷史。翻開我們中國的歷史的篇頁，當中却完全是保留着一治一亂的興亡往跡，但却總是治的時候少，亂的時候多。各位都曾看過三國誌演養的罷？也許記得開章明義他便說：「天下大勢，分久必合，合久必分。」我國歷史上的治亂分合，究竟是什麼故？面亂的時候，往往總是時間很長，治的時候，往往總是時間很短，這又是什麽原故？中國四五千年的歷史中，眞正享有太平，人民眞正能得安居樂業的年代，究竟有多少年？恐怕眞是太過於短促了。這就是我國中國向來就有良好的基層組織，我們不能够加以保留改進的原故，人民總常常在兵慌馬亂，談虎色變中，讓生命財產毫無保障的陷在水深火然的痛苦裏不能自拔。黄帝時候的「井道」，夏商周時候的「井田」，及「鄕遂」之制，都是最良好的基層組織。春秋時有大政治家管仲出，有「軌里」之法，才有齊桓公九合諸侯，一匡天下的覇業偉績。秦國的特別强盛，是爲商鞅的「什五連坐法」，也是最元善的基層組織，漢唐爲我國全盛時代，其能發揚國威就是由於漢的「鄕亭」，制度及唐的「里鄰」制度，是最良好的基層組織。所以才能開拓疆土，（外人稱我爲秦人，漢人，唐人）內安外攘，表現豐功偉績。宋王安石創立保甲保馬等法度，都是當時健全基層組織，非常良好的制度。但因受到保守勢力的種種阻撓，不能得行其道，不久，才有靖康之恥，接着宋也只好亡國。明代王陽明先生的「什家牌法」等，也因不能普遍應用，不加保存。流寇發生，勢如破竹，明朝仍然亡了。由我國歷史上看來，基層組織不能建立，所以我們會有兩次亡了國，這是一個怎樣沉痛的敎訓？使我們由此能够深切認識到墓層組織的重要性了。</p>
<p>在我國歷史上發生變亂的時候，總是由於當時的農民受到暴君汚吏土劣的過甚壓迫，使他們在不得不用民變暴動的方式，來求推翻政府，改造國家，若果，人民能够安居樂業，國家就得太平。不能各得其所，民不聊生，自然就發生暴動。兄弟來自田間，幼小時在家鄕，就親眼看見父老兄弟姊妹，受盡種種壓迫和痛苦。農民對國家的貢獻，尤其以這一决的抗戰，出錢出力，流血流汗，只有他們貢獻得最　最大。兄弟迄今二十八年如一日，都喜歡與農民接近，並努力從事於基層工作，以地方自治爲終身的理想事業，願爲淡民而工作，願爲農民而求得他們的自由解放。本着這個理想，兄弟願爲這個崇高的理想，一息尚存，此志不容稍懈的永遠做下去，這項工作，若不能及身完成，還要我的子子孫孫不斷的做下去。</p>
<p>從國父遺敎來看</p>
<p>由國父遺敎來看，兄弟生平最佩服我國歷史上的兩個偉大人物，一個就是用非常雄偉的氣魄以全力來統一分崩離析的國家的秦始皇，那是因爲時代不同，所以他所採用的方法，純是專制的　一個是認淸時代的使命，順應世界的潮流，用民主的方法，建立我們國家的國父，他曾說：「地方自治者，民國之礎也，全國三千縣之民權，即似三千塊之石礎，礎堅則國固，國固則子子孫孫同享福利。」我國政治與其他國家不同，我國政治，就如以建築一所房屋爲例，總是先上樑上柱，不注意建築基層，一遇大風暴雨的來臨，隨之而傾圯崩潰。而我國一般從政的人，又只想做大官，不願爲小官。人人都只願意集中於都市，集中於省，於中央，對於地方的基層工作，從來不願注意，我們的國家不强，而亂多治少，分多合少，這就是如同用我們建屋的方式，去建國的原故，而多數人們只想做省長，總統，不願做鄕長保長，這實在是不對的。</p>
<p>但我國有一種建築是最好的，就是寳塔，總統總斑，就如一個寳塔的塔頂，兄第最近到杭州去，特別去登臨高達十三層的六和塔，據說它的建築年代，至今已有八百多年，竚立塔頂，俯視錢塘江上的帆影波光，中心殊覺愉快。兄弟當時就有這樣一個感覺，認爲這個塔的建築者，眞正可以作我們地方自治的導師。（據說是宋代人，忘其名）所以今後我們建國，就要像建塔一樣，今天在座諸位，都是一些非常良好的工程師。</p>
<p>從近代歷史來看</p>
<p>從近代歷史來看；太平洋彼岸的新興的美國，他的建國歷史，至今才不過一百六十多年，英國只不過一千多年，他們如何能維視世界？就是一個面積狹小的比利時，也只不過是七百多年的歷史。他們如何能做到使人不敢小視？可以說完全是由於他們的藝層組識好，地方自治的工作健全。日太在侵略我國前後，在戰敗以前，他們的地方自治工作雖也不錯，但因為只注重了政治的組織，而忽略了經濟的組織，所以只做到強國，而不是富國。美國的織斯福總統的偉大，是舉世皆知的，但他死後，杜魯門總統，或者人們會以為他較羅總統平凡，不過人家國內基層組織良好，總統只是一個塔頂，任何人來做道個塔頂，國家的固有的當強，是不會變質的。英國也還是一樣，邱吉爾首相在戰時領導全國抵抗德國，不可一世，戰後工黨的阿特里登台組閣，對於國家行政效率，絕不因邱吉爾的去職而發生絲毫影嚮。也還是由於人家的地方自治良好，基層組織完善的綠故。</p>
<p>再來看看我們中國，眞覺得可憐！因為我們在內憂外患的夾攻之中，所以現在雖然訓政完結，憲政即將開始，到今天我們還不能完成一縣一鎮的地方自治工作，我們眞正感到是一件奇恥大辱。若我們要勉強的去搜尋，只有過去的山西，廣西，還略為有一點成績，此外，是兄弟在河南服務親眼看見河南的鎮平，鄧縣，內鄕，浙江等四縣（統稱宛西）的自治工作，辦理得相當良好，其間有兩個特出人物，一個名彭禹亭，一個各別廷芳，他們尤其對「術」的工作做到全民皆兵，能夠自衛，在抗戰中敵偽不易侵入，屏障了我們的陝川鄂邊。此次李先念的部隊，由湖北竄入，到宛西邊界，就不能越雷池一步，其他的管，敎，養，部份，也做得相當的好。這是一個少有的奇蹟，所以兄弟主辦的下一期地方自治專刋，特別出版一個「宛西自治中心專號」來表彰他們，獎勵他們，使各地聞風興起，倘若我國各自都能像他們那樣注重基層組識，地方自治工作及民選縣長，何息不能早日完成？</p>
<p>從總裁言論來看</p>
<p>從總栽的言論來看：總裁創制新縣制，在縣各級組織綱要中規定；「縣為自治單位，縣為法人」，縣旣已經是地方自治的單位，同時他又是其有「法人」的資格，他當然依法具有獨立自主之權。鄉鎮是一個基本單位，所以他也同樣的具有「法人」的資格。我們由於新縣制的訂定，可以獲得充分的證明，基層組識的重要性是怎樣了。為了一種眞正賓貴的理想，我們應該用見義勇為，當仁不議，始終不渝的精神，來完成這一項崇高的理想，神聖的工作。因此，兄弟以為要能達成這一項理想和工作，就不能忽略下面的二項措施：</p>
<p>人才下注與上升</p>
<p>我們一說到在　層組織中，要怎樣才能來完成他所要舉辦的工作？但我們總不免一來就深深感到在鄉緩中第一是缺乏餞，第二是缺乏人，所謂人才俱無。鄕鎮只有一個空壳，上面說過，人才及有錢的人都只想向都市，省，中央跑，只想做大官，不願為小官，人才向旁的地方去求發展，試問在蕊層組織中的管敎養衛的工作，找什麼人來舉辦？兄弟以為國家應該特別訂出一項制度，不論是地方上的任何人，在中學或大學畢業以後，至少都要轉囘家鄉去做一年的工作，就如中央軍校舉業的學生，畢業後要到連裏做見習官一樣。這樣一來，可以使他們深知民問疾苦，　層組議的重要，使他們不致忘去根本，同時還可以使他們的工作熊力，知識經騐，加多加強，另一方面，就是地方上向外分散的人才，集中於都市，省，或中央的多數人，（就是縣，省，中央政府中最少限度都可以裁去三分之一的人）讓他們回縣鄕云，回到基層組織中云工作，如此才能眞正的做到人才下注，一切事業，才可以逐漸興辦，但仍然必須政府完成一種法制，才能實現。</p>
<p>人才下注做到了後，仍要補之以人才上升，因為，一個優良的人才，在倣了十年，二十年的基層工作以後，當然不免有不甘寂寞，力求進步的意念，如加壓抑，必致一無成就，地方自治工作，我們不能來純全盡義務，應該由國家給以俸給，訂立官等，由鄉鎮保長，升至科長，縣長，縣長可以升至專員，專員可以升至委員，廳長，一層層的升上去，然後直到中央，並要完成偽制度，使基層組織人員，都有上升的機會。其次國家更要訂定一種獎懲，競賽的標準，在一定辦法中，一定時期內，去加以競賽老核，對鄉鎮縣，省，中央，都是一樣。鄕鎭與鄕鎭間，縣與縣間，那些鄉鎭，那些縣份能夠與利除弊？解決了數幸百年久縣未決的問題，可以示範的，我們就可以獎勵他算是一個模範鄕鎮模範的縣，或是模範的鄉鎮長，威是縣長，有特殊功績的。這個鄕長就可以稱他為一個鄕鎮英雌，讓他受到全縣，或全省全國的崇敬。自然人才倍出，否則，我們的基層組織裏，不知埋沒了多少無名英雄，豈不可惜？各級都有英雄，人才自然就會興起，這是建立基層政治中，不可少的舉措，假使得法，敎養有道，鼓勵有方，才能人盡其才，地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流。</p>
<p>基層組織的展望</p>
<p>顧亭林先生說：「大官多其國亂，小官我其國治」。實在很有道理。大官多了，有時不免常常發生同牀異夢，挑撥離間，舉甲倒乙，聯乙個丙的事，反而偽了爭權奪利，因私忘公，把要做的事，放下不辦。若是小官多呢？不論是管，敎，養，衛，在何一項事，大家都還能同心協力，各站崗位去埋頭努力。就單以一個保甲的一衛」字來說，國民兵保隊辦得好，一朝有事，不論一擊鼓，一鳴羅，也能立刻集由槍刀棍矛，撲滅幾個匪徒，聯合各個鄕鎮的武力起來，縣府的武力，國家的軍隊都用不着，讓他們全部放到國防上去，請諸位看這效力大不大？</p>
<p>就再以生產說，每一保都能够挖一水塘，利用塘中的水，可以灌溉田畝，植蓮藕，養魚鮮。江寗縣四百七十保，每保養魚百斤，植連藕百斤，請問以此類推，共有多少？至於其他農村副業也是一樣，每保能有力量養一個殘廢無告的人，全國八十幾萬保，我們就能救恤八十幾萬個人。所以蒸層組織辦得好，國民政府眞可以到那時高拱無憂了。反而言之，再單以一個「衛」字說。國家為每一保的一衛」的一項，用一個兵士，全國便要用這八十幾萬個兵士，每人每年最少限度用一百二十萬元，試看一看，國家每年就要花消多少金錢，這就不雖想像了。</p>
<p>最後，我們更可以深知，基層組織良好，國家建國工作才有辦法。國家內部，才沒有內亂。就如今天各地匪徒的殺人放火，也就不會有了。人民也就能夠安居樂業了。所以基層組織完成了，地方自治工作實現了，我們中國才能永遠停止內戰；長治久安，過去日本偽什麼來侵略我們，就因為我們是一盤漫無組織的散沙。不然，以我們的眾多的人口，吐一口氣，睡一滴涎沫，都可以使他毀滅·我們禍去，不只缺乏政治組職，而且更缺乏經濟組織。我們要改造國家民族的命運，就在今天在座各位的身上，地方自治完成，我們處處都是桃源樂土，錦繡江山，我們世世代代子子孫孫，都能同享幸福，成為世界上最憂秀的民族。「湯以七十里，文王以百里而王天下。」願諸君勉之！</p>

<h3>報告莫斯科會議經過　馬歐爾演辭全文（續）</h3>
<p>德波疆界問題形成一大爭端</p>
<p>疆界問題—德國疆界問題是一大爭端，也是與會人員對於三巨頭有關德國疆界宣言致的又例於爭的速，人民逃德河以西地去的在前，蘇聯就有人跡的，坦時，杜門面道種局面。在情形下，總頭言，承認局面，三巨頭宣言有調：「三巨頭謹此霞申其意見：量後刨足波蘭西派界縷之間題，應劊待和的決定。」</p>
<p>現在莫浴托夫卻說波茨坦會歙己就波德區思間題獲致錢後婉議，並謂上述一段僅篇和的應決定疆界之謂踴因此他認為目前所應老慮的只有那些劃界的技術上問題而已。</p>
<p>美政府承認在雅爾達會議中所負的義務，對於波蘭在寇急儷以東併入蘇蠍黜運日在西部予絨公正的補償。咀滄蠍訂德國與波蘭閒的臨時曰藕，如果永入存在，將使德國失去一部份領土，而這部份領士在戰前供給德國人同所仰給的糧食五分之一以上。顯然的，德國無論如何必須在很有限的疆界內，不但支持和戰前一樣多的人口，而且還須供給自東歐的大批德人。</p>
<p>這種情形固然是無法避免的，但我們決不能在任其更醒嚴重。我們不願波瀾減少其戰前所有的資源。波瀾應得更多的資源，但是把邊界給予波瀾，對於波蘭並無裨益。因為這些邊界將來威許引起各種難題，邊界不論劃在什麼地方，不應成為對貿易和商業的障礙，歐洲的幸福完全繫於這種貿易與商業等。我們必須瞻望到一個民主的波蘭和一個民主的德國成為良好隣國的前途。</p>
<p>草擬對德和約意見頗不一致</p>
<p>和約程序——關於對德作戰的各盟國如何參加德國和約的草擬與認可一事，意見各不一致。與此事有關的國家有五十一國。其中除四大盟國之外，直接從事於作戰的有大人國，當然作戰的範　有大有小，各不相同。</p>
<p>美政府的立塲認為對穗作戰的各盟國都應該有機會參加和約的草擬與締訂，但是我們承認：由五十一國全體參加草擬一個條約，雖非不可能，實際上將有不少困難。所以美政府力圖促使各方一致同意於一種方法，這種方法包括兩種不同的程序，視有關的國家是否實際參加作戰而定。但各國都將有機會提出他們的意見和反駁別人的意見，而各國都將出席一次和平會議，以通過一個條約。</p>
<p>曾受德軍佔領恐怖及在堅苦作戰中遭重大損失的國家，很難同意接受未受人力物力損失而離戰爭很遠的各國參加決定和約的條件。但美國認為凡是對德交戰的國家，對於解決穗國問題，都應有發言權。</p>
<p>對於四強公約蘇聨有延宕</p>
<p>四強公約一四強公約的建議是美國政府一年前提出的。我們希望這個簡單的公約，迅速為各方所接受，在締造對德和約，解決穗國問題之先，保證美國有意和他國密切合作，以防範德國的重整軍備。這個公約的訂立，將消除對未來的恐懼，使適合目前和未來歐洲需要的和的，便於成功。同時，我們又希望美國方面簽訂此項公約，將使歐洲各強國恐懼美國重採第一次大戰後步驟的心理為之解卸。那時候美國先是對和約若干條文，堅持不休，然後又忽然退出，把執行和約的實任推得一乾二凈。我們認為四強訂立公約，保證繼續使德國解除武裝會再度昭示全世界，我們具有全部誠意，謀獲歐洲的和平安全。</p>
<p>但是，孫聯政府針對我們的建議提出一連串的修正案。這些修正案足以使整個公約的性質為之更改，使它實際上成為複雜的和約。而且蘇方把許多對德問題　本上絕難獲致協議的要點也包括在修正案內。因此我不得不下一個結諭：蘇聯政府不是不願意這個公約的實現，就是企圖拖延時日，使它一時不致採納。至於這個問題的最後協議能否獲到，尚有待事實證明。但我相信美國方面，一定會固守目前的立塲，堅持公約的簡單化並使它限於一個　本的目的—那就是使德國不能再度發動戰爭。</p>
<p>對奧和約要點意見頗有出入</p>
<p>對奧和約問題—對奧和約談判的結果為大部問題均獲協議，惟尚有數點仍無法解決，此數點均極重要。對於付給賠償及割讓卡林西亞與南斯拉夫，蘇聯表示贊同，惟其他與會國家均表反對。</p>
<p>蘇聯對奧境德資產問題極其重視，按照波茨坦協定，奧境穗資產應歸與蘇聯，蘇方認為凡在奧境之德國資產（其他三強認為這些一九三八年三月德軍開入奧國後以武力強佔之奧人及盟國僑民資產），應一律視為奧境德資產。蘇方拒絕老　「強佔」一辭，其他三強則認為「強佔」一辭厥為決定何者確為德國資當之重要準繩。</p>
<p>蘇聨並拒絕考慮任何折衷辦法，以解瘊此項爭端。一切覓取折衷解決的努力，都沒有結果。依我的意見，美國決不能承認這種顯然有欠公允的條約，而且這種條約將造成一個荏弱而無援的奧國，足為將來重大危險的根源。在會議的最後一次，大家同意委任一個委員會，定於五月十二日在維也納集會，以便重再考慮我們的異議，並設立專家小組會，以便查老德國在奧的資產。我們如欲履行我們的義務，承認奧國是一個自由獨立的邦國，並解除它佔領區的食祖，那末我們對於對奧條約，當然應採取迅速的行動。</p>
<p>摘要—這些問題雖然很複雜、但其中關於中歐的特性和管制，尚有一種式樣可找。各外長同意：他們的任務是要奠定一個穗國中央政府的甚礎，促成德國的經濟統一，設立可能實行的邊界，並通過四強條約而成立有保證的管制。奧國應迅速解決佔領負祖，而以解放國與獨立國的地位相待。</p>
<p>莫斯科會議中無法獲致協議</p>
<p>莫斯科會議欲求意見一致是不可能的，因為照我們的看法，蘇聯是在堅持各種建議，這些建議將在德國設立一個中央政府，以便對於這個經濟必告崩潰的國家抓住一種絕對的管制權，此一政府在經濟上的崩潰是注定的，因為它地域不廣人口過多，並將以大部份生產，抵償賠款之用，主要的是對蘇聯的賠款。蘇聯代表團對奧國也要求同樣的抵償，不過採取另一種方式而已。</p>
<p>據美國代表團的意見，這樣的計劃不但牽涉美國無限期的津貼，而且結果僅能造成德國和歐洲經濟生活的愈趨惡化，而必然引起獨栽和爭鬥。</p>
<p>我們的政府所代表的報道自由，必然包含一切訴諸與論。但在莫斯科，以宣傳訴諸情感與成見，似乎代替了訴諸理智與諒解。孫聯代表團對波茨坦和其他協定的指摘和解釋，與美國代表團所瞭解的事實，完全不同。</p>
<p>關於各種建議，或對此種建議所提出的反對，其眞正的用意和動機，當然是不能確定的。這是在任何國際談判中不可避免的。</p>
<p>但是不論上述的意見如何分歧，面對的問題如何困難，我們對問題的最後解決所已獲得的進展可能比事先想到的更大。</p>
<p>把各方意見不同之處，一一顯現，這還是第一次。此後問題看得清清楚楚，未來的商談便知道該如何下手去解決懸案。各國外次都已明白各國政府對不同問題的準確觀點。那末，他們或能解決一些異議，或是把協議與不能協議的研究結果，提交報告，使未了的問題更為澄淸。這就是下幾個月的最大的希望。不管進步如何艱苦遲緩，而結果必然會有一些進步。這些事情對全歐人民的生活以及世界歷史的未來都具有極大的重要性。我們不應該在大原則上遷就，以但反協議而完成協議。同樣地，對不同的意見我們必須誠意地求得瞭解。</p>
<p>在這個地方，我想到史達林元帥向我聲明的一段話。他說到這次會議時，認為這些都不過是對這個問題前哨力量的試探和接觸而已。過去我們有過多問題，發生過許多不同的意見，但好像已成一個定規，人們在辯論疲倦之後，便明白協調的需要。這次會議上我們或不會有太大的成就，但他認為對所有主要問題成立協義仍舊可能。這些問題包括解除德國武裝問題，德國政治組識問題，賠償問題，經濟統一問題等等。我們必須有耐性，而且不要悲觀。</p>
<p>歐洲處境嚴重蘇不應拖延</p>
<p>我衷誠希望史達林所表示之觀點乃屬正確，我希望他的意見顯示在未來的會議中，蘇聯代表團將有較大的合作精神。然而我們不能忽視這兒所牽涉的時間因素。歐洲的復興已出於我的意料，遲遲未見實現。分化的力量愈見明顯。醫師正在深思熟慮，而病人却已奄奄一息。因此，我認為我們不應一再拖延而至無可救藥的時刻到臨時才有所行動。新問題與日俱壇。我們應毫不遲疑地採取穩種可能的行動，以對付這些迫切的問題。</p>
<p>最後，我願就一種和我們全體人類都有重大關係的事的某一方面發表一已的意見。正和貝爾納斯的際遇一樣地，我不能挽請參院外委會兩位首要委員相偕赴會，可是我却得到杜爾斯氏的極有價値襄助，杜氏是共和黨眾院議員和外交問題專家。事實上，在此次會議期間，范登堡康納利兩參議員於領導參院策劃外交政策新發展的工作聲中，曾明顯表達美對外事務措施熊度中的兩黨性質。此種意見一致的跡象對於遠在莫斯科的我顯有莫大帮助。我認為今日此界的形勢和美國的處境已使美國人民採取一致行動的責任。這也就是我詳儘報告我對外長會意見的原因。（完）</p>

<p>爭取智慧的崇敬！</p>
<p>爭取思想的自由！</p>
<p>在中國近代思想史上，「五四運動」是應該大書而特書的一頁。這個運動最初是愛國運動，後來從愛國運動演變爲思想解放運動。所謂解放者，乃從封建思想中解放出來，推翻舊禮敎，吸收泊來的新思想。在文學方面，最大的收穫乃是白話文代替文言文而登寳位。</p>
<p>就「五四運動」的史實來分析，它首先對事對人而發；即使後來從現實而轉到思想，也是「順演」，而非另起。那麽，我們不妨說：它是被動的。其次，該運動對於推翻舊禮敎有莫大的功績；無奈這種功績祗含破壞性，而無建設性，所以是消極的。其三，它吸收泊來的「新」思想，——在它國也許已是陳腐了，——飢不擇食，多多益善。結果呢？矛盾，膚淺，變質，不消化！在這一點上，它整個失敗了。</p>
<p>自此而後，每逢一次國恥，必激起一陣愛國思潮。可是，由愛國思潮擴大深入爲某種思潮的很少。個中最重要的一次是「八。一三」之後；那一次的最盛期恰當中國文化界人士集中在武漢；那時候，國家至上，捐除小我的成見，共謀建樹精神上的新中國，聲勢之浩大，波濤之汹湧，幾乎駕「五四運動」而上之。因爲「五四運動」祗含破壞性，此次却含建設性；「五四運動」是消極的，而此次是積極的。</p>
<p>不幸一切的高潮都難能持久，而此幾乎駕五四而上的運動，僅止乎「幾乎」，並非未成爲事實！自從「慘勝」以來，中國的文化界已臨破產地位。這並非不是我們危言聳聽，却是百分之百的眞事實。我們找任何一位教授，任何一位作家，任何一位學人，任何一位出版商，任何一位新聞記者，任何一位大學生，任何一位任何類的文化人，同他或他們談談當代中國文化界的情形，除非對方是瞎子，聾子，白癡，神經病，他或他們決不會樂觀的！</p>
<p>也許有人把這種境界的造成歸罪於「慘勝」。話，未嘗不對，只不是全對。另一批人以爲這與「內亂」有關；內亂造成不安，不安造成不景氣，不景氣自然包括文化的沒落在內。這種看法，也是局部對，而非全對。爲什麼呢？若論「慘勝」，不止咱們中國一國，法國「勝」得更比我們「慘」。然而最近的莫斯科會議，蘇聯是地主，美英是大柱子，參加是當然的；此外，曾經投降過的法國參加了，抗戰對底的中國却被摒於門外：這是爲了什麼？莫不因爲中法同樣是一慘勝　，法國已經踏上復興之將，而咱們中國，進步得太慢，去此目標尙遠，因而被人輕視麽？再退一步講，——也可以說進一步講，——「慘敗」的國家，如德如日，尤其是日本，他們所過的日子當然比我們苦，但從他們以往的文化水準以及民族性的堅忍而論，他們的復興似乎不致太慢，不致太沒有把握，這又是爲了什麼？若說「內亂」，似乎春秋戰國時代，無日無戰，亂得更甚於今日，然而當年的學術豈是今日的學術所能媲美？這更是爲了什麼？</p>
<p>唯物主義者流就說：這種種都因爲物質關係，物質文明不昌明，必然造成這種慘果。我聽到了「物質文明」四字，不禁微笑：因爲物質固然可以造成某一種文明，然而運用物質的還須依賴腦袋。「物質文明」與「精神文明」的分野在乎：「精神文明」以人爲主，以物爲奴；「物質文明」初興時也以人爲主，極盛時却以人爲奴了！尤其文化落後的國家，——「文化」兼攝精神與物質，——逢到了文化進步的國家，必然爲奴隸。當代中國做了列强的「二爺」，就是說高等奴隸；至多也不過是一位淸客；若論平等，遠在十萬八千里以外！這是事實，我們不應當再被「五强」一稱迷糊了眼睛，蓄意不看，或不敢看這個事實！</p>
<p>「大西洋憲章」說明了新的人權，也說明了人類新的尊嚴，合乎時代的尊嚴。然而，這個憲章反映着目前的世界並不承認這種人權和這種尊嚴；——否則的話，如果已經成了事實，又何待乎這側憲章呢？在中國，自從很久以來，——遠在「五四運動」以前，——所有一切的政策和一切的社會活動都犯了「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」的毛病；以一人」就「事」，而非以「事」就「人」；這種喧賓奪主，反奴爲主的作法，完全拋棄了應享的人權，完全忘去了人類的尊嚴！木必自蛀而後蟲生之，人必自侮而後人侮之：自己旣然自輕自賤，人家何必來尊重你呢？</p>
<p>論視覺，人不如猫；論嗅覺，人不如狗；論跑路，人不如馬；論體力，人不如牛，然而人爲萬物之靈，猫狗馬牛爲其所用：這是爲了什麽？因爲人類有高度的智慧，多方面地發展；而動物的智慧或比人差得遠，或祗單方面發展，或只有摹倣性而無創造力。人，不過是宇宙中一枝最脆弱的蘆葦而已：微風可以把它吹倒，滴雨可以使它低頭。一隻小小的麻雀，立在柳枝上，隨風飄盪，毫無關係；可是，萬一牠看中了這枝蘆葦，這枝蘆葦可負担不起牠的重量，如果幸而不斷腰，勢必俯伏在地！然面……這是一枝有智慧，能思想的蘆葦：它明知自己的脆弱，却能想出種種方法，先得保陣自己，進而圖克服比自己大上不知多少億的倍宇宙：這是人類的命運，這是人類的野心，這也是人類的偉大所在！所以人類的尊嚴在乎智慧。</p>
<p>固然，這枝小小的蘆葦是非常倔强的，它以大無畏的精神與風，火，水，士，日，月，星，獸相周旋，相撲鬥。它的一生是不斷的奮鬥，它的幸福是勝利的微笑。然而，自從一顆種子變成一枝蘆葦，有相當的過程；在這過程裏，它需要甘霖和薰風，——猶之人類的思想需要自由！據說世間有一種騙子，專騙小孩，騙來之後，把孩子養在缸裏，長成了，便化爲形形色色的怪物：在不自由氣氛裏養成的的思想都是古怪的思想。這枝　葦，即使長大了，是病態的蘆葦，是不健全的蘆葦。</p>
<p>假使「五四運動」是解放運動，是把被舊禮敎索縛住的中國人解放出來，恢復其自由，尤其恢復其思想的自由，那麼，我們不得不悲嘆該運動流波不宏，半途而涸！遠的不談，——因爲我們沒有鉅大的篇幅，也沒有充分的時間來逐一叙述，逐一批評，——且談近在目前的，就是說自從「慘勝」以來的短短時間。思想自由麽？當然，國家至上，凡危害國家的思想都該掃除：世界各國都如此，不獨中國爲然。然而即使在國策範圍內，凡憲法及普通法律所允許的，曾否培植自由思想，曾否讓思想自由發展呢？我將臥寐以求之，求之不得，祗能輾轉反側了！</p>
<p>我很誠懇相信政府並未存心抑制思想：一則，當局諸公都是讀書人，縱然飛黄騰達，高官厚祿，畢竟還保存着些書生氣；二則，他們積了多年的經騐，深知思想不能「抑」，「抑」則「變」，「變」則爲「害」更大！然而有一點他們不得不承認：這幾年來並未重視智慧，並未重視學術！他們不是沒有類似重視學術，類似重視智慧的措施，甚而內中若干項還差强人意。然而一般的說，求其公爾忘私，眞正深切懂得崇敬智慧，懂學術之可寳者，恐怕寥若晨星！其實晨星並不少，只是太陽光強了一些，刑花了眼睛，——而此時此地的大陽光是黄金色的！</p>
<p>因爲這個一厘之差，把整個中華民國變爲混亂落伍。「上下交征利，而國危矣」：現今是否上下交征利？姑且不談。單就這種「買辦精紳」如洪水泛濫，已足亡國而有餘！什麼呌做「買辦精神」？上海人都懂得這一套；我爲非上海人的讀者　幾句：見了洋人，忘爺忘娘，鞠躬如也；見了華人，神氣活現，昂昂然也；見了金錢，心花怒放，飄飄然也。「人生以賺錢爲目的」，鬼兒子纔讀書！如此如此，這般這般，便是「買辦精神」。現今的老頭兒，壯年，小伙子，先生，太太，小姐，少爺都在「動腦筋」，想撈一把。固然生活逼人，大部分的時間還是「人」去逼「生活」，不斷地把生活提高。</p>
<p>我們看看別人的國家是什麼樣的？先說美蘇兩國。它們在思想上，在政策上是南北極，然而它們尊重智慧則一。原子彈如何在美國發明？因爲美國肯花錢，肯下資本，集中各國的學者，予以生活的保障，予以硏究的便利：於是原子彈不在別國，而在美國先發明了。在第二次世界大戰以前，美國的應用科學非常發達（因爲有錢），理論科學却不如德法。現今它不但迎頭趕上，而且隱隱居於領導地位了！若論蘇聯，最初有個錯誤：勞工神聖壓低了腦子工作，學術水準猛烈降落，幾乎不及帝國時代。他們發覺了這個錯誤，立刻很巧妙地把「勞工」放寬尺度，兼指「手」和「腦」，於是無所不包了。今日，在蘇聯，一位腦工作者最低程度無凍餓之虞。</p>
<p>「參勝」國的法蘭西，想盡方法，使盡氣力，提倡學術，爭取人類的尊嚴。報載法國已經發現原子彈全部的秘密：據常情推測，這個消息不會是假的。「慘敗」國的日本，在美國人翼護之下，必然在作學術硏究，若千消息已經透漏過來，見諸新聞紙了。「慘敗」國的德意志，處境比“本困難，——日本受一强之庇，而德意志面臨數强瓜分之危，——然而若說德國人不作學術研究，正如說中國人不打麻將，同樣不可靠！</p>
<p>人家在埋頭硏究，我們却在發揚「買辦精神」。大槪原子彈可以用麻將抵拒，而雷達火箭可以使關金中和。人的體力不如牛，人的奔馳不如馬，人的嗅聞和視囑不及狗貓：人而去了智慧，人而輕視智慧，那比牛馬狗貓都不如！丁茲五月四日，又値上海作協開成立大會，盪氣廻腸，我發出下列的呼聲；我想凡是不願做半，不願做馬，不願做狗，不願做貓，而願做「人」的人，必然向我表示同情，和我同聲喊：</p>
<p>——我們要：</p>
<p>爭取人類的尊嚴！</p>
<p>爭取智慧的祟敬！</p>
<p>爭取思想的自由！</p>

<h3>文藝巨著的產生</h3>
<p>— 孫福熙</p>
<p>紀念五四並祝「上海作協」成立</p>
<p>「五四」紀念到今天已是二十八週年了，以今比昔，有了什麽進步，實在有點說不淸。</p>
<p>第一，回憶當時文藝上與學術上的熱烈情緒，遠非現在所能比擬，當時的「新青年」「新潮」，「每週評論」，「星期評論」等刋物，內容是何等充實，態度又何等堅定鮮明。尤其是當時的讀者，不論靑年與老幼，在攻讀時的虛心與熱誠，絕無成見，不存絲毫利害私心，一意以學術爲最高原則。不但對各種雜誌如此，即對於每種日報上的副刋亦竭誠盡心。若與現在相比，與其說現在的讀者不及以前的熱烈至誠，不如說現在的刋物沒有以前的吸引力。</p>
<p>第二，從時代上說，當時政治十足是軍閥的黑暗時代，名雖爲共和國，而內政與外交，國民未得參與。現在則革命已經成功，抗戰已經勝利，民主與行憲的呼聲亦已達到最高峯，然而，在文藝上與政治上的民主精神，甚且不及二十八年以前的熟烈。這不能不怪我們有匹夫之責者不够努力。還記得當時的我們學生，開會，辦刋物，請名家演講，都出於全心全力，旣無權勢企圖，亦無利名意味，人人是身穿藍布大褂一件，沒有跳舞電影這類名詞的煩擾，甚且香烟醇酒亦不相親近。這些話當然是難兌落伍與冬烘之議，但仍可供國民體格與國民道德測騐的參考。</p>
<p>第三，許多人疑問：爲什麼經過抗戰的大時代而文藝巨著尙朱產生？抗抗戰以來，識見是增長多了，人生意味是了解多了；更於處理自身與處理國事的見解有强大的進步。但現在正在醞釀與組織，將來必有文學巨製與藝術傑作的出現無無疑。西洋學者認歐美社會不够豐富，到非洲去觀察原始人的生活，去研究熱帶病狀况。中國是形形式式，無奇不有，實在是學術的好材料，大可不必灰心，我認爲中國一定將要產生世界的大學問家，文學與藝術上不必說，將來在社會學經濟學政治學上，還要產生世界獨特的大家，現在正在研究與整理中，將來必能一鳴驚人。</p>
<p>但希望中國靑年不要自餒，同時還望負有領導靑年之資者的注意，這就是紀念文藝節和慶祝上海作協成立的意思。</p>
<h3>五·四頌</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>誰劃下五。四，</p>
<p>難禁受的春寒日子；</p>
<p>這象徵文藝道路，</p>
<p>經過多少的崎嶼炎凉。</p>
<p>我們不要錦的心，</p>
<p>也不要　的口；</p>
<p>有力的巨筆，</p>
<p>永遠擎在補天之手。</p>
<p>看！</p>
<p>衝破了春寒，</p>
<p>死灰裏亮出星星，</p>
<p>文藝在荒土上開花了！</p>
<h3>一個團體·幾項業務</h3>
<p>— 王進珊</p>
<p>「上海作協」籌備人對於團體今後業務的幾點意見</p>
<p>在過去，已經有不少類似的團體，有過先例：開一次成立會，通過幾條章則，掛一塊招牌，從此烟消雲散，髣髴大功業已吿成。所謂秀才造反，三年不成；文人辦事，只是興之所之，類多有頭無尾。因此大家都希望上海作協的成立，不是如此，也不能如此，更敢相信不會如此。</p>
<p>在另一篇文字中，我曾經談倒一個文藝團體的組織任務，除了會員與會員之間感情的聯擊，事業的合作之外，無庸諱言的，就是爭取寫作的自由，保障寫作的權益，進而共同建立一種新的寫作信念，創造現代中國文藝的新作風。</p>
<p>籌備期間，朋友們都發表過許多寳貴意見，大家認爲時代已經進步，作風也應該改變，而今團體更重於小我，友情更重於政見，實踐更重於理論，互助合作更重於個人發展；互相尊重思想的自由，共同尊重人類的智慧與感情；這不能不說是五四運動以來，又經過八年抗戰的熬煉，所造成的中國知識份子思想的覺醒。這一個月來，上海作協的籌備工作所以能迅速完成，微求會員所以能普遍而順利，也不能不說是　於這種共同信念的因素。</p>
<p>因此，今後組織任務的實踐，便成爲今天成立大會的主要課題。經費還沒有來源，人事也不能確定，不過大家確信精神勝於物質，人力重於物力，只要大家有一份共同的事業心，對自己的團體有一份會員的責任心，有錢同然可以辦事，沒錢也要想出幹的辦法。也就是只要大家都還有心力可以供獻給我們的團體，社會各界一定也會給我們事業上的聯繫和協助。爲了上海作協的前途，爲了今後的文藝事業，必需如此，也應該如此，更非如此不可。</p>
<p>在這兒，可以試舉幾項事業，說明一個文藝團體可能舉辦的業務。</p>
<p>例如，作品的介紹與評選，本來是一種文藝服務或通訊事業，可是）社會還沒有進步到產生這種機構的時期，但是現實的需要已經存在，我們的團體便不妨當仁不讓的擔當起來。</p>
<p>且體的說，團體可以和出版機構接洽代編文藝叢書，也可以接受影劇機構委託編撰影劇脚本，與音樂團體合作編撰歌詞，與美術團體合作編撰圖文並重的作品。</p>
<p>倘若政府或其他社團舉辦文藝獎金，團體便可以接受委託，代辦徵選和推荐的手續。</p>
<p>還可以有計劃的選譯優良文藝著作，介紹給國外出版界；同時也可以把國外優良作品，　譯供應國內出版機構的需要。</p>
<p>又如，增進作家的福利事項，也是團體不能忽略的，版稅的結算，著作物的登記，手續繁瑣，書生本色的作家又多不層爲此，團體便可以特約律師，會計師經常擔任會員的法顧顧問。類此的還可以特約醫師，醫院擔任會員的醫藥顧間。</p>
<p>那麽特約書局，出版社經常優待作家購書；特約圖書館儘量便利作家借閱參考書刋，也是天公地道，應該辦，可以辦的事。</p>
<p>倘若經費充足，或是有人投資的話，團體可以自辦出版機構，印行會員作品，以及建築會所，招待所，甚至於文藝新村。</p>
<p>再如，在聯絡情誼之中，最好不忘切磋觀摩，實踐「以文會友，以友輔仁」，一般文藝團體經常舉行的各種茶會，晚會，欣賞會，紀念會，以及集團游覽參觀，共同硏究批評，也都是團體中所費無多，所獲甚大的活動。</p>
<p>更如，要爲下一代建立一點堅實的文藝基礎的話，指導靑年寫作，也應該是上海作協所不能忽視的工作。評改靑年作品，約請名家講述寫作經騐，舉辦短期寫作講習會，以及推荐靑年作品發表或出版。上一代雖然沒有給我們多少幫助，我們却不能因此丟開不管。「後生可畏，焉知來者之不如今也。」這是孔子早已說過的。</p>
<p>團結就是力量，互助合作就是辦法；過去文人相輕才造成往日文藝界的分歧，和今日文藝園地的荒蕪。戰時文藝建設無疑的應與物質建設並重；况且，就以文藝作品的形式而論，也正如我們這一代的生活形式一樣，舊的已經破壞，新的還待努力。在這時代爲了追求理想的諧和，不得不光求實際的調和；爲了建立共同的信念，不得先放棄各目的成見；爲了創造中國文藝的新作風，不得不從新的組織的建立開始。上海作家雖不敢說要做各地作家的榜樣，但，上海作協須得給各地文藝團體一點示範，一種新的觀感。乃係事實如此，縱不存心如此，也非如此不可。</p>
<p>附註：本文所論大部份均係各籌備人月來交換意見之所得，筆者代述，不敢掠美。</p>
<h3>祝「上海作協」成立　愉快與願望</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>籌備了這久的「上海文藝作家協會」，總算在今天正式成立了！</p>
<p>「正式成立」給我們帶來了愉快，同時也帶來憂慮</p>
<p>在參加籌組的過程中，曾和許多朋友交換過意見。大家都認爲在文化中心的上海，組織一個文藝團體是亟需要的，間題只在如何組織？組織的意義何在？於是，進珊兄在四月十九日的春秋上就公開的代表了我們向大家表示了態度。這里，本毋庸我多所饒舌，爲了表白個人的一點敏感和願望，似乎不得不說幾句，以了職責。</p>
<p>文藝與政治，本是有密切的關係。因此過去有少數人竟把文藝視爲政治的工具。—辛克萊都這末說：「一切藝術都是宣傳」；把文藝團體當做爭政權的武力。一方面高唱民主，一方面却把玄關閉得緊緊，拒人於千里之外</p>
<p>文藝作者本身應該是絕對自由的，超然的，他的作品應該是反映時代的一切，不但使當代的一切發生影響，就是後代也會因之而發生力量。這樣的文藝才有生命！這樣的作家才够得上稱爲偉大。姑勿論古代的文藝及其作者，我們祗就大衆熟悉的曹雪　和魯迅來作個例：</p>
<p>「紅樓夢」與「阿Q正傳」，雖是兩部內容不同的著作，但他們的恩想體系是相同的。他們用尖說的眼光透視了一切，在筆底，針對着現實，反映出當代的一切，儘管讀者的看法各有不同，但它畢竟是兩部滲透人心的互著，有生命的巨著。所以，他們都能够獲得廣大羣衆的愛戴和崇敬。</p>
<p>換言之：曹雪芹和魯迅的是盡了文藝的職責，完成了作家的任務。也就是說：他們的作品並非爲政治而利用，相反地，是改善了政治，是領導了政治。</p>
<p>所以，我們盼望多產生這樣的文藝和這樣的作家。而且更盼望這樣自由主義的作家聯製起來，成爲一個自由的寫作集團。在友情上可能增進在生活上得到互助，在學識上相輔相成，在事業上可以發揮更大的力量。因此，我們應該不分黨派信仰，不拘男女老少，不塑造偶像黨魁，不關門閉戶，已成名的作家和在學習的靑年，都可以自由參加，共同在自由的空氣裏呼吸。這就是我們亟需組織此會的願望和目的。</p>

<h3>好聞不是新聞？</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>昔日小市民形容一般上人的能耐，有云：「秀才不出門，能知天下事」。在從前，雖然未必有新聞紙，官報邸抄之類火約是有的，這所謂「天下事」，亦僅限於廟堂，民間新聞不與焉。時至今日，若干小報咸以黄色新聞或內慕新聞爭勝，算是迎合時好，較之官報邸抄之類枯燥的說敎，自不可同日而語，但就新聞迫德說，前者尙不失爲「實錄」，後者則只是誇張或揑造而已。</p>
<p>値得研究的是，爲什麽有許多人愛讀這種明知其爲揑造的新聞。——為了生活單調的緣故？還是日趨墮落的社會風氣在鼓募他們？</p>
<p>英國赫胥黎曾說過一句名言：「好新聞不是新聞」。這話的含意，其實也就是「狗咬人不是新聞，人咬狗才是新聞」。在一個一切反常的社會裏，「正常」遠不如「反常」來得吃香。報導一座大橋的建設計劃，自遠不如有關淫慾，盜刦，殺戮的新聞來得吸引讀者。在這樣的境遇中，如加以若干人迎合取寵，羣以「黄色」或「內幕」爭勝，自然更喚起了讀者的反常的慾望，這是必然的事。</p>
<p>同時，我們也不能一味怪記者們在製造黃色新聞，社會風氣的敗壞，有時倒鼓勵他們在胡說，在揑造，而他們的胡說和揑造則又轉而影響了社會風氣。長此以往，就變成了一個循環體，終於將使整個社會墮入萬刦不復之境地。</p>
<p>比如說，最近發生於上海的兩件逆倫案：飯店主人陳達達姦汚親女，茶館小開杜羣圖　庶母，情節的離寄，就有點出於「黄色新聞製迭家」們的想像以外；至於依利莎伯公寓內破獲的人妖「沈五爺」案，其猥褻的程度，較之小報上的連載小說尤甚。這還有什麽可說呢？在目前，彷彿整個社會在向淫慾和殺戮的道路念進，那遮掩在「猥褻行爲」之上的禮義廉恥等字眼，在一般人看來或許已比甲骨文還要難懂了。總有一天，學者們將不得不來考證這四個字的眞正含義了吧。</p>
<p>我想起某報記者在記述「人妖案」後所說的話：</p>
<p>「現在，復興中路那座漂亮的伊莉莎伯公寓的十一號房間已經　無一人，賸着美麗的紗格窗帘空懸着，遮掩掉室內的一切，正和這都市的繁華和富麗，障蔽住一切荒淫和無恥一樣。」</p>
<p>紙是包不住火的，如果以爲美麗的紗格窗帘足能掩蔽室內的　　褻行爲，則「沈五爺」似應該尙有幾年「皇宮」可居；如果以爲都市的繁華和富麗，足以障蔽一切荒淫與無恥，則上海灘的盜刦和逆倫案又怎能登上新聞紙？</p>
<p>未來的世界如尙能稱爲「樂圍」，我想，第一個條件，必須是「唯好新聞才算是新聞」！</p>
<h3>談簡體字</h3>
<p>— 衣白</p>
<p>我國文字，結構複雜，不僅書寫費時，初學者常惑不易記憶，對於敎育之普及，不無影響。年來熱心敎育人士與文字學家，爲掃除文盲，推進民衆敎育計，從事於簡化文字工作者，頗不乏人。簡體字的創製，逐漸增多，失學民衆，莫不稱便。惟文字簡書，不自近代始，「謔集」嘗載一故事云：「唐進士有單性者，就試主司。主司誤書爲「單」。單訴云：「雖則陋宗，然姓氏不欲爲人所轉易，乞改正之」。主司曰：「方口尖口，亦何足辦」？單曰：「若不足辦，則臺州吳兒縣，改作呂州矣兒縣可乎」？主司無以應」。</p>
<p>現行簡體字中，簡書部份所川符號，並無一定標準，實有研討必要。如「敵」字左旁之「商」，簡書爲「舌」，設「適」字之「商」，亦書作「舌」，則成南宮適之「適」矣。又如「懷」作「怀」，「還」作「還」，則「環」與「環」之簡書，應同作「环」矣。再如「鷄」旁之「奚」，「漢」旁之「　」，以及「歡」旁之「葛」，均以「又」字代表，作「　」，「漢」與「歡」，同一符號，三號可用，殊覺「汉」不能作「溪」或「灌」，「　」又不能作「鶴」，雖習慣使然，究不合理，初學者識字不多，尤難辨識。鄙意簡筆符號，必須劃一，假如以「父一代「舊」，則「觀」為「觀」，「權」為「權」，「歡」作「歡」，自無疑義，但「漢」祇能作「濯」，不能作「英」或「溪」。至如「　」「奚」，當另湘簡單符號分別代表，庶幾體制分明，不致混雜，對於初學，自多裨益，不知當世致力於簡化文字工作各專家，以爲何如？</p>
<h3>可憐人語</h3>
<p>— 乘之</p>
<p>艾森蒙威將軍講一個故事，他說：「歐洲戰事結束後，我奉令搭機返美參與某會議，在許多乘客中，有一位是傘兵，他吿訴我不少關於他的飛行經騐，可是在我們飛機降落時，我發現他顯得非常的不安。</p>
<p>「孩子，怎樣了？」我問地。</p>
<p>「將軍，」他發着抖回答道，「我在飛機中降陸，這還是第一遭呢！」」</p>
<h3>死模活樣</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>南送　史載：「癸丑元夕，上（理宗）呼妓入禁中，有唐安倫者，歌色絕倫，帝愛幸之。侍郞牟子才奏曰：「此皆董宋臣輩引誘，壞陛下二十年自修之操。」上令丁大全諭旨曰：「納忠不妨，但勿散副本可也。」子才又作高力士脫靴圖，有與宋臣善者，拓本以遣之。宋臣大怒曰：「口說尙可，乃畫此死模活樣乎？持入謂上曰：「牟某在當徐駡官家。」上視其圖笑曰：「乃駡汝，非駡我也。」</p>
<p>古往今來，小人輩多係如此，其所作爲，臭而且醜，由於心虛，更怕人說臭說醜。有如患過痛瘡的人，畏懼別人打痛其瘡疤，如出一轍。說上面這節故事的人物與時間吧，理宗處小朝廷南面稱孤其時已經是襄淮地區失守的失守，吿警的吿警，國事蜩　，國難日亟之際，稍微有點良知的人，決不致那樣犬　聲色，荒唐透項的了。而他却招妓入禁中，逍遙得很。董宋臣以一小黄門，看中皇帝弱點，投其所好，邀幸固寵。這正是小人物的聰明處，及其死模活樣處。等別人家繪出他的尊容，得確連自己也有點看不順眼的時候，於是就不耐煩了，也並不想將自己的死模活樣糾正一下，反怪別人不應該一口說尙可，乃畫此死模活樣乎，」結果哭訴到主子面前去，企岡尋求報復。可見「克己」的工作，在小人物們是更難做到的。或以爲此係中國人的傳統精神亦無不可。君不觀夫阿Q乎？頭上長着　　，不怪自己生的不好，却到處忌諱別人說「光」「亮」一類字眼，與這董宋臣本來就是十足死模活樣的行徑，却羞恨牟子才臺脫靴圖，不是同樣的道理嗎？</p>
<p>今天，黃宋臣的時代固已得遙遠了，阿Q的時代正還存在，死模活樣的人不少，怕人說死模活樣者亦就大有人在。</p>

<p>題目上的兩位先生，是「五四」運動那一年被介紹給國人的。可是廿八年來，這爾位先生活終被擱在一邊，沒有多少人認識他們，旣不認識、自然不會理睬，更不會親熱地將他們當作夥伴。事隔廿八年，現在再要稱名道姓地介紹他們，實在太對不起這兩位被冷落的客人了。</p>
<p>說起這件事，我們不能不承認當時介紹的失敗，也就是新文化運動一部分的失敗。新文化運動的一個果實是白話文的拓展，不幸這個果實却沒有成熟就給摘下了。提倡白話文的目的是口語與文字的致，是文字的大眾化，是要把文字成為大眾的工具。因為唯　有大眾能讀能寫的時候，才能使德先生賽先生爲大衆所認識，爲大衆所愛慕。現在的白話文並不屬於大衆，它還是少數人所京有的東西。儘管我們把白話文如何口語花，可是大衆一日不認識它，就一日和它相距千里之遙，無法接觸。缺少這個媒介，我們要希望把德賽二先生介紹與國人，終覺萬難。</p>
<p>「五四」運動被人稱爲文藝復興運動。錯誤就在這個地方。我們所需要的不是什麼復興，而是一個澈頭澈尾尾的啓蒙運動。「五四」運動之中，我們大量介紹西方的文化，並且努力改善了介紹的工具。惜乎祗見木而不見林，徒知在白話文上團團轉，却沒有把白話文交給大衆。　之無甚高論，我們忽視了基本的敎育。</p>
<p>大衆化的文字固然重要，文字有大　所認識則尤為重要。在全國文盲猶佔百分之五十以上的現在，德賽二先生斷難為大衆所認識。賽先生的特性是科學的方法，是合乎遍輯的思想，德先生的特性是相互的寬容，是彼此妥協的藝術。這些東西倘沒有敎育作爲工具，即不能深入大衆，而祗能成爲秀才們的紙上談兵，沒有兌現的資金。我們不反對兩位先生一再的站在台上被介紹，可是文盲的眼睛必須使之發亮，讓他們親眼看見兩先生才好。</p>
<h3>「合作」</h3>
<p>— 屺</p>
<p>她正在修理那拋錨在狹路上的汽車，但是她車後的汽車等得不耐煩了，拼命地撳着喇叭，最後，跑到後面的車上。</p>
<p>一非常抱歉，但是我修不好它」。她很婉和地對那司機說：「要是你能代我去修理它，那要也很願意留在這裏代你撳喇叭。」</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「我們已經等候一月多了，要不是其他方面沒有辦法，我也決不敢再來麻煩熊處長的」！他勉强陪着笑，用極婉轉的詞令說：「好在我們並無奢望，什麼車都行有一輛也成，有兩輛更好……」！</p>
<p>熊處長仰着臉，眼望着天花板，透出不很耐煩的神氣。</p>
<p>「聽說明天有一批軍車要開回柳州，……」老祝打算把自己的要求漸漸說得具體化起來。</p>
<p>可是處長室的門又給人推開了，進來是一位打扮得挺漂亮，眉眼都會說話的三十歲左右的少婦；一陣香風吹到，立刻驚醒了險朝天的年少的熊處長，他立刻跳出了座位，笑容滿面的迎上去。</p>
<p>老祝失望得差一些就想拂袖而走。</p>
<p>男主人和女客人在一片歡笑聲裏各佔一張沙發坐下，談話立即極順利地展開；老祝好容易用一顆糖抑住了滿腔的憤怒，裝着不在乎的神氣，坐在後面傍聽。可是心緒已亂，火半的話都聽不進去，只偶然聽到一兩句話，籠統地知道這位闊太太是爲着她那滿載商貨的三輛卡車給檢査所攔阻不放而特地來乞援的；熊處長起初似乎也打了一套官話，但經不起那位妖媚的太太再三使出了以柔制剛的手段，便給她玩弄得意志全消，什麽話都沒有了。</p>
<p>「那末你立刻給我打電話！別一轉臉又忘掉了交情」！最後，那位懂得把握時機的闊太太就立逼熊處長以電話通知公路上的檢査所，放那三輛卡車開出桂林。</p>
<p>熊處長跨着醉人一樣的步子，歪歪斜斜地走回辦公桌去。</p>
<p>「打回電話，我請你吃飯」！他一面拿起電話聽筒來，一面用眼睛盯着那位脂濃粉膩的闊太太說。</p>
<p>這可把祝兆年急壞了。</p>
<p>「忙什麽？你就是這樣」！那位闊太太扭着頭！嬌嗔似的說：「晚上我請你』！大槪中午她也實在沒有工夫，或許效是早已吃過了。</p>
<p>祝兆年這才鬆了一口氣。</p>
<p>以後的六七分鐘過得很快，那位闊太太限見目的已達，便不願再和這容易衝動的少年軍官多纏，熊處長雖然已被挑逗得很興奮了，可是對方堅持　要走，也沒有法子强留。（六二）</p>

<h3>Lu National Army Tightens Encirclement, Fierce Fighting in Southeastern Mountainous Areas, Tense Situation in Southern Shanxi, No Major Changes in Northern Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 3rd] The National Army has launched a large-scale annihilation campaign against the communist forces in the southeastern area of the Yimeng Mountains for several days, with unprecedentedly fierce fighting. As of the 3rd, the National Army has achieved brilliant results. Following the National Army's momentum in capturing Mengyin and Xintai, remnants of the 4th, 8th, and 9th Communist Columns attempted to avoid the main force and flee back to Yishui and Ju County. However, the National Army preemptively cut off the communist forces' retreat on the west bank of the Yi River. The main force of the communist troops, approximately 50,000 men, was heavily encircled by the National Army in the triangular area of Mengyin, Yishui, and Tangtou. Over the past four days, the National Army has gradually tightened the encirclement. Although the communist forces have made three desperate attempts to break through, all have failed. According to initial reports received on the 3rd, as many as 5,000 communist troops have been annihilated north of Qingtuo Temple and east of Duozhuang alone, and the National Army is currently expanding the gains across the board.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 3rd] The war situation in Shandong Province has completely shifted to a favorable position for the National Army. Recently, the communist forces' feints to the east and attacks to the west, as well as their attempts to resolve the National Army's major forces in Tai'an and seize Yanzhou from Ningyang, have all failed. The various columns participating in the fighting in the Tai'an and Ningyang areas have been entirely or partially shifted to the Yimeng Mountains in recent days. On the 3rd, fighting continued in the area east of Xintai and Mengyin, where the communist forces have been pinned down and unable to escape.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 3rd] According to a dispatch from Xuzhou, the National Army is fighting steadily in various locations, aiming to achieve the goal of pacifying the areas in a short period. In the Yimeng Mountains, the National Army annihilated the entire 5th Division of the 2nd Communist Column in the Qingtuo Temple area on the 2nd, and decimated the 6th Division of the same column and a part of the 7th Column in the Jiehu area.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 3rd] The communist forces in the southwestern areas of Tai'an and Feicheng in central Shandong are currently trapped in the National Army's pocket-shaped position. The 1st, 2nd, 6th, 7th Columns, and a part of the 10th Column of the communist forces have recently retreated from southwest of Tai'an and Ningyang to the east of Culaishan and the Laiwu area for reorganization. The situation in central Shandong is expected to become clear soon. Furthermore, there are no longer any traces of communist forces in the vicinity of Qidezhen, southeast of Dakou.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Xuzhou, 3rd] On the morning of the 2nd, the National Army's mopping-up forces in the Yimeng Mountains captured and encircled over 10,000 men from a part of the 9th Communist Column in the Hongshan and Dushan line, six kilometers northwest of Ge Gou. Two-thirds of the communist forces were eliminated after a day of fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Jinan, 3rd] According to reports, the 5th Communist Column of Shandong was bombed by the National Army while assembling in the area north of Ningyang on April 30th, resulting in heavy losses.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch from Taiyuan, 3rd] Fierce battles have broken out on the periphery of Taiyuan to defend the city. The communist forces have entered areas more than sixty *li* away from Taiyuan. The fierce fighting is still centered on Shouyang, with the communist forces extending more than fifty *li* west of Shouyang. The main force of the National Army is concentrated around Shouyang City to defend it firmly, while dispatching strong units to counterattack and expand in multiple directions. Fierce fighting is taking place in Yangquan, Pingding, the eastern and western edges of Yangqu, and within the borders of Yuci County.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Taiyuan, 3rd] Two columns of communist forces are besieging the National Army at Ceshipotou between Yangquan and Shouyang, with fierce fighting underway. The communist forces invading from Meng County split into two groups and moved west. One group, numbering tens of thousands, turned south towards Shouyang City and attacked, suffering over a thousand casualties and retreating to Huangdanggou after being fiercely attacked by the National Army north of the city. The other group, numbering five to six thousand, moved west and captured Lingjingzhen, posing a threat to disrupt the eastern mountains of Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd] Pingding County, east of Shanxi, was once again captured by communist forces on the evening of the 1st. This location is 125 kilometers from Taiyuan, on the southern side of the eastern section of the Zhengtai Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] The situation in southern Shanxi has become serious. The National Army is reorganizing. The bridgehead position at Maojindu is still being defended by the National Army, with the communist forces surrounding the narrow strip of land just ten *li* from the crossing. Telecommunications with Pinglu have been cut off, and the situation is unclear. Jiexian and Yuxiang are surrounded, and local forces in Ruicheng have broken through and withdrawn south across the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] War situation in Shanxi: (1) The communist forces captured Zhaocheng in Huo County on the morning of the 1st. On the afternoon of the 2nd, fierce fighting was taking place in the suburbs of Hongdong. (2) A unit of 3,000 communist forces from Huo County launched a surprise attack on the garrison at Xujiadian Station, south of Lingshi, on the afternoon of the 2nd, and the garrison retreated into the town to await reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Xi'an, 3rd] After the recapture of Suide, Peng Dehuai, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest People's Liberation Army of the Chinese Communist Party, fled east with his horses and family to Yihezhen. The 3rd Police Brigade and the 1st Independent Brigade of the communist forces occupy the area around Cijiayita and Cijiahe, while the 358th Brigade of the communist forces remains in the area around Zhangjiachuan and Mudanchuan.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Gui Sui, 2nd] The communist forces in northwestern Shanxi originally planned to invade north in two routes, one led by He Long, attacking Suiyuan and Baotou, and the other led by Yao Zhe, attacking Datong. However, they have now changed their route and are circumventing Taiyuan. The vanguard troops coming from Xing County have been discovered within the county borders. Furthermore, the Kang Jianmin Brigade, which recently invaded west from northern Chahar, arrived at the Baiyin Bulang Yaozi Bulang area near Wulanhua at 5 PM yesterday. The National Army cavalry is tracking and pursuing them. Wulanhua is heavily defended, and there are unlikely to be major changes in the situation in northern Suiyuan.</p>
<h3>Tangyin in Northern Henan Falls, Sun Dianying Missing After Issuing a Brief Will, Provincial Assembly Sends Representatives to Beijing to Request Assistance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd] Tangyin was captured by the communist forces at 7 PM on the 2nd. Since the morning of that day, the communist forces used over a hundred Japanese artillerymen to shell the city walls with heavy artillery. By about 3 PM, much of the fortifications had been destroyed, leading to fierce street fighting. By 7 PM, the city had fallen. According to reconnaissance aircraft reports, the fighting at the time was extremely fierce, with extraordinarily heavy casualties on both sides. Corpses were scattered inside and outside the city, and the city walls were stained red with blood. The city had been under siege since April 5th, for a total of 17 days. Sun Dianying, the commander of the 3rd Column of the National Army, issued a brief will at 2 PM that afternoon and has been missing ever since.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 3rd] Tangyin County has fallen into the hands of the communist forces, and Commander-in-Chief Sun Dianying is missing. Liu Bocheng personally commanded the communist forces that captured Tangyin. The month-long siege resulted in over 40,000 casualties for the communist forces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xinxiang, 2nd] The Independent 4th Brigade, New 5th Brigade, 5th Brigade of the 2nd Column, Special Service Regiment, and troops from the Southern Hebei Military District, numbering over 15,000 men, continue to besiege Cuijiaqiao, east of Anyang City. The fighting is fierce, and the town is still being firmly defended by Wang Muquan.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd] The Third Session of the First Henan Provincial Assembly dispatched eight representatives, Qu Wanshan, Li An, Niu Jifei, Liu Zengruo, Miao Chongxiu, Ding Hansan, Shen Huanan, and Wang Shoumei, from the assembly at 9:30 AM on the 3rd to Beijing to appeal to the central government. The reasons are that the communist forces under Liu Bocheng are besieging Tangyin and Anchang in northern Henan, lasting for over a month. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are gathered in both locations, without food or shelter, in a extremely miserable state. The defending troops are lacking ammunition and reinforcements, and are in imminent danger. At the same time, since important crossings such as Fenglingdu and Maojindu in southern Shanxi have fallen to the communist forces, the river defenses have suddenly become tense. Local forces are eager to defend their homes, but lack ammunition. Communist forces in the eastern flooded areas of Henan are also becoming increasingly rampant, and the situation is extremely critical, reaching a breaking point. The representatives asked the central government to quickly send a large army to relieve the siege of northern Henan, consolidate river defenses, stabilize the flood-affected areas, and quickly allocate ammunition to local forces for self-defense, and also allocate a large amount of relief funds to handle relief efforts. At 3 PM, they visited Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi and Deputy Minister Qin Dechun, who expressed sympathy and promised to pay absolute attention to the requests.</p>
<h3>Communist Division Commander Killed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd] Ning Xianwen, commander of the 9th Division of the 3rd Communist Column, was killed by the National Army in the battle of Wankougouzi, 20 kilometers southwest of Liuhe, on April 1st.</p>
<h3>National Army Changes Strategy on Baoshi Section, Emphasizing Search and Destroy Operations on Both Flanks, National Army in Shijiazhuang Expands Outward</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Baoding, 3rd] The National Army moving south on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section has changed its strategy from a direct assault to emphasizing search and destroy operations on both flanks against the main force of the communist forces. A part of the left-wing army group is pressing Anguo, and is still engaged in mixed battles in the surrounding areas of Boye and Anguo. Another part captured Gaoyang yesterday and is pursuing the communist forces retreating in a southeastern direction, advancing towards Hejian. On the morning of the 3rd, over 3,000 communist forces were surrounded and are resisting stubbornly in Banbidian, at the border of Renqiu and Gaoyang. The National Army has the trend of clearing the central area between the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, and opening up the Baoding-Shijiazhuang road.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Baoding, 3rd] The National Army in Shijiazhuang has been actively counterattacking in recent days, and has expanded its offensive outwards, pressing Yecheng in the east, reaching Jingxing in the west, and crossing Liuxinzhuang in the north, sweeping in the east and west to eliminate the remnants of the communist forces along the Tuo River. Officials claim that there are no longer large groups of communist forces within forty *li* of Shimen, and that the main force of the communist forces between Zhengding and Xinle has mostly taken refuge in the Taihang Mountains.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] The communist forces have recently been harassing Xushui and Caohejian. At 8 PM on the evening of the 2nd, Ma Hui's New 4th Brigade attacked the garrison at Fangying, west of Xushui, for four hours, leaving behind two corpses and retreating west to Dadian.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] The mystery of whether or not the National Army has recovered Wanxian, Tangxian, Dingxian, and Lixian has been solved. The National Army has arrived in these areas one after another, but after completing the mopping-up tasks, they have moved to other areas to fight. Currently, there are no National Army troops stationed in the county seats of the aforementioned counties or in Gaoyang, which was recently recovered. The purpose of the National Army's operations is not to occupy strongholds, but to pursue the main force of the communist forces.</p>
<h3>Lingyuan Has Been Relieved</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Shenyang, 3rd] The siege of Lingyuan has been lifted. The communist forces are attempting to move troops to Chengde and Duolun. Furthermore, the communist forces on the Songhua River front are shifting towards the Fuyu area, threatening Changling and Tongliao on the right flank of the Chinese Changchun Railway.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Shenyang, 3rd] When a reporter inquired with Commander Du Yuming about the recent rumors that the communist forces had assembled 40,000 troops in Rehe, Du replied that the force might be in the area of Chicheng outside the Great Wall, but there were no confirmed reports.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Changchun, 3rd] The communist forces in northern Songhua are currently gathering near Fuyu, Damai, Changling, and Liaoyuan, numbering about 60,000 to 70,000 men, appearing to be planning to invade Nongan and northern Liaoning. At the same time, they are urgently repairing the railway from Damai to Wangfu. However, internal Jiangxi in the communist ranks is increasingly fierce, and the desertion rate of new recruits is extremely high. Therefore, the military authorities here believe that even if the communist forces attack, they will suffer a serious blow.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu Salt and Yancheng Are Peaceful, Remnants of Communist Forces to be Cleared Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 3rd] According to a military official from Funing, the remnants of the communist forces are currently causing disturbances in the areas of Yancheng, Funing, Xiangtai, and Lianhai in northern Jiangsu, but their strength is limited and they are unlikely to succeed. A part of the elite National Army troops reinforcing northern Jiangsu has arrived in Dongtai, and another part is advancing north along the Grand Canal. After the deployments are complete, a large-scale mopping-up operation will be launched. Yancheng and Funing are peaceful. The rumor that they have been captured is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Taixian, 3rd] The communist forces have recently designated the low-lying coastal area of several tens of *li* along the Tongyu Line, a narrow strip of land 800 *li* long from Guanyun in the north to Haiqi in the south, as the "Coastline," using it exclusively for moving north and south, and launching harassment attacks on various recovered areas at any time.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces Attack Great Wall Coal Mine</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] The Great Wall Coal Mine near Qinhuangdao was suddenly attacked by over 3,000 communist forces starting on the 29th. Over a thousand employees are trapped.

Although Li himself has repeatedly expressed his firm refusal, according to other sources, he will assume the position after some personnel issues within the party are resolved. Zuo Shunsheng is scheduled to assume the position of Minister of Agriculture within the next week. Li left Beijing for Shanghai at 3:50 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd and will return to Beijing in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs, Li Huang, took a train to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 3rd and is scheduled to return to Beijing within a few days. It is reported that Li expressed his humble refusal for the new position, but after being urged by Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan and members of the Youth Party, Li agreed to go to Shanghai for further consideration and stated that even if he assumes the position, he needs to make some preparations in advance.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd] Xu Fulin and Yang Junming of the Democratic Socialist Party are scheduled to return to Shanghai from Beijing at 8 AM on the morning of the 4th.

Our reporter specifically inquired with Mr. Ye Duyi, who said: All of this is a rumor and is absolutely inaccurate. Luo Longji has gone to Beijing again on official business. Furthermore, the Provisional Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Democratic League was established on the 2nd of this month.</p>
<h3>CCP Not an Autonomous Political Party, Negotiations Therefore Unsuccessful, Mr. Tao Xisheng Discusses "Reorganizing the Government"</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd] The Central Cultural Movement Association held a cultural lecture at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, inviting Tao Xisheng to lecture on "On Reorganizing the Government." Mr. Tao raised three questions: (1) Can reorganizing the government solve the problem? (2) Why did the government not continue peace talks and why not make greater concessions to the Communist Party? (3) Can the Communist Party solve the problem? Mr. Tao pointed out that the biggest problem in reorganizing the government is to end one-party politics. Mr. Tao stated: Once transitioning from one-party politics to multi-party politics, there is no going back to one-party politics. The government almost completely accepted the Communist Party's demands from September to November last year, but there was still no peace, so the Communist Party should be fully responsible for the breakdown of the peace talks. Mr. Tao also pointed out that the Communist Party is not an autonomous political party, so it cannot solve the problem. After the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party join the government, they will surely achieve ideal development, cooperate and compete with the Kuomintang, both will progress and lead China to the road of constitutional construction.</p>
<h3>Chairman Summons Minister Bai</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd] Chairman Chiang summoned Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi at his residence at 9 AM on the morning of the 3rd and gave him some instructions.

The team consists of ten members, including one from the National Government, two from the Executive Yuan, and seven from the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinwu, Editor of North China Daily, Arrested</h3>
<p>Truth Not Yet Ascertained</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 3rd] Zhang Jinwu, an editor of the North China Daily here, was arrested on the 1st. Because those who carried out the arrest did not show their identities at the time, cut off the telephone lines, and fired two shots as a show of force, killing one person, it caused outside discussion. One newspaper pointed out that Zhang was taken away because it was related to the case of Yu Xing, the maid who was raped by Zhao Yunxiang, the former puppet army commander of Sun Liangcheng's troops, which was published in the newspaper. Yesterday, the Beiping Headquarters specially issued a public notice stating: "The Headquarters received a secret report that Zhang had held a puppet position and was a dangerous element, so he was arrested." All parties attach great importance to this, but because the truth is not clear, the newspapers remain silent. Several people from the local journalism community went to the Headquarters today to ask for bail but were unsuccessful. The Headquarters spokesperson stated again today that Zhang has been handed over to the military law department for strict interrogation, and the truth will soon be revealed. The authorities will not ignore the fact that the outside world and Zhang's family claim that Zhang's arrest is related to the Yu Xing case and that he has been framed, and are preparing to thoroughly investigate this point.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Government to Be Established This Week, Governor-General's Office Busy Preparing for Handover</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Taipei, 3rd] The Taiwan Governor-General's Office has been busy preparing for the handover in recent days, and stopped receiving and sending documents starting on the 3rd. The previously tense and exhausting work mood seems to be gradually easing. At the last government affairs meeting on the 2nd, Governor Chen still urged his subordinates to ensure that the handover procedures were clear and that any difficulties should be explained in detail, so as to create a new atmosphere. We have received a telegram that the newly appointed Secretary-General Xu Daolin and [name missing] will arrive in Taiwan by plane on the 3rd, and a welcome banquet will be held at [hotel name missing] tonight. At noon, farewell banquets were held by Yang, President of the High Court, Liao, President of the Local Court, and the Chief Prosecutor, all from the judicial circles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the departure of Ren Xianqun, Director of the Communications Department of Taiwan Province, to Beijing yesterday, the employees of various transportation agencies in Taiwan Province, including railroads, highways, shipping, ports, and communications, became restless upon hearing the news, and transportation on land and water lines is trending towards stagnation. The people of the province are fearful and have sent telegrams to the central government, urging Director Ren to stay in Taiwan and work. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has decided to appoint the Director of the Transportation Administration soon.</p>
<p>Moreover, civil servants here, especially technical personnel, are leaving one after another, and more people are trying to obtain the qualifications of "redundant" or "laid-off personnel," because Governor Chen Yi has approved these personnel to enjoy three to five months of severance pay. However, this does not apply to those who resign voluntarily.</p>
<p>It is rumored here that Provincial Chairman Wei Xinyi will come to Taiwan between the 7th and 8th, and the Provincial Government will be established on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] U.S. Ambassador Dr. Leighton Stuart flew back to Nanjing from Tianjin by special plane at 12:30 PM on the 3rd, while the Director of the U.S. Information Service, Connors, flew directly to Shanghai.</p>

At the meeting, it was decided that companies such as "China Textile," "Yongli," "Jiuda," and "Qixin" would share the next year's expenses of US$36,000 according to last year's ratio, to continue the plan of Yanjing University to train practical industrial talents. The school will raise the remaining US$20,000 on its own.</p>
<h3>Part of Taiwan Goods Decontrolled</h3>

<h3>Possible Use of Five Hundred Million Loan; US Considers Extending Deadline; Sino-American Lend-Lease Accounts to Be Cleared</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] State Department officials informed this agency's reporter on the 2nd that the extension of the deadline for the $500 million loan to China from the Export-Import Bank is currently being considered, possibly extending it beyond the 30th of the month. They stated that Chinese officials in Washington have informally proposed a plan to use a portion of the $500 million loan, and a detailed plan will be submitted soon. Meanwhile, some members of Congress are urging that the loan be granted immediately, without requiring a detailed plan, and that only a statement of its purpose should be sufficient. However, officials formulating US policy have not yet expressed approval of Chairman Chiang's reorganized government, especially Secretary of State Marshall, who opposes lending the entire amount to China at once.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The State Department announced today that China is about to begin negotiations with the US on resolving $1.51 billion in Lend-Lease Act debts, the $500 million loan from 1942, and other wartime accounts. A precise date has not yet been decided. When the State Department made the $500 million political loan to China, the terms of its repayment and the method of converting the loan into long-term public debt were not specified. According to State Department sources, the terms for resolving this loan will not be overly harsh. The State Department stated that the terms of the agreement to resolve the Lend-Lease accounts with China will be as liberal as those with other countries, especially the United Kingdom. The UK's Lend-Lease accounts totaled $31 billion, less reverse Lend-Lease accounts and other US obligations, leaving a net repayment amount of $25 billion. The resolution method involved the UK repaying $650 million, approximately 2.5 cents on the dollar. The Sino-American negotiations will also involve other financial obligations between the two governments during the war, including the situation of unadjusted wartime surplus material transactions and other financial claims arising during the war. Last June, the two sides signed two agreements on Lend-Lease issues, one stipulating the payment of two items and the transfer of civilian oil pipelines after Japan's surrender, and the other stipulating the terms for setting limited payments for military Lend-Lease accounts within a limited period after last June. However, neither of these two articles concerned the economic matters of resolving Lend-Lease accounts in the Mutual Aid Agreement of June 2, 1942, nor the general issues related to wartime accounts. Surplus materials valued at $900 million have been sold to China for $210 million, of which $120 million has been offset by the US for the cost of maintaining US troops stationed in China, and China has agreed to pay $55 million in Chinese legal tender. Of this, $35 million will be used by the US to purchase and improve US government properties in China, and another $20 million will be used for cultural education programs.</p>

Premier Zhang's instructions were as follows: Compulsory grain purchase is a policy, and we hope (1) to institutionalize and systematize it; (2) that colleagues in the work can have enthusiasm and perseverance to ensure the completion of the task. At the same time, he emphasized that the wartime food policy will not be changed, and the grain administration organization will also not be changed. He also urged that the abuses of compulsory grain purchase by local governments and Baojia chiefs be effectively prevented, so as to avoid people complaining about the government. The cases passed today were (1) regarding the compulsory purchase and clearing of grain and grain funds from previous years; (2) the organization and expenses of grain collection, etc.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Shen Guojin, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry of Food, is scheduled to depart after the Field and Grain Conference to inspect and supervise grain transportation along the provinces and counties of the Yangtze River. According to Shen, the waters are now high, and the need for grain in various places is urgent, so we should take the opportunity to speed up transportation. It is also heard that Shen claimed to the attendees of the Field and Grain Conference on the 3rd that the amount of military grain payable from June 35 to April of this year reached more than 1.6 million large packages.

<h3>Adjustment of Field and Grain Institutions in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] This year's field tax in various provinces, in accordance with the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, will still be collected in kind and in currency, and the practice of forced borrowing will be discontinued. Therefore, the field and grain storage and transportation institutions and their expenses in various provinces should be readjusted. The following decisions were made on this matter at the Field and Grain Affairs Review Conference: (1) The new organization will be implemented from July, and the existing institutions should be adjusted within one month from June 1. Depending on the number of counties collecting in currency, the personnel of the provincial and county offices and storage and transportation institutions will be reduced, and the severance pay will be shared by the central, provincial, and county levels. (2) The routine expenses and living allowances of the provincial field and grain offices and the county-level and lower field and grain institutions that collect in kind will be borne by the central government. The counties collecting in currency will directly deduct 5% of the field tax that should be received by the central government as collection fees. (3) The routine expenses and living allowances required by the municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan for handling field tax matters, as well as the cost of printing field tax lists and vouchers, will be shared by the central government and the municipalities according to the proportion of income. (4) The cost of printing field tax lists and vouchers for counties collecting in kind, as well as the collection operating expenses and inspection tool expenses, will all be borne by the central government. The above-mentioned expenses required by counties collecting in currency will be listed in the collection fees directly deducted. (5) Various field tax expenses, total household registration fees for each business, and field tax promotion fees will all be borne by the central government. (6) The living allowances for the staff of the field and grain departments in the counties collecting in currency will be paid according to the county standard, and the remaining staff at all levels will be paid according to the provincial (municipal) standard. (7) The various expenses for the first half of the year, from January to June, will still be shared according to the previous regulations, and the funds already advanced by the central government will be cleared and supplemented separately.</p>
<h3>Soaring Grain Prices in Various Places; Common People Cry Out in Misery</h3>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The rice and meat industries in Nanjing are both without markets, and the black market prices are shocking. The price of meat is 8,000 yuan per catty, and the price of top-quality rice is 170,000 yuan per stone. However, there are frequent disputes among citizens who buy rice and flour at government-subsidized prices. Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau, went to various districts at 7:00 AM on the 3rd to inspect the sale of rice by rice merchants, and at the same time formulated measures to avoid profiteering by unscrupulous merchants. The measures are as follows: (1) Select rice shops with good credit to sell government-subsidized rice exclusively; (2) Reserve cooperative societies distributed in various districts to sell on behalf of the government. Xie said that Nanjing has four months' worth of food rice reserves, and there should be no panic about food rice in the future. In addition, the reason for the steep rise in meat prices is that meat merchants originally requested to increase the price limit to 5,800 yuan per catty, but it was not approved by the municipal government, resulting in a situation of no market and no goods.</p>
<p>Jiangsu</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] Rice prices have risen sharply in recent days, with listed prices of 170,000 yuan but no market, and the black market reaching 200,000 yuan. Common people are crying out in misery. Yangzhou is slightly lower, hovering around 150,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun telegraphed to Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, on the 3rd, ordering that rice and grain within the territory of Jiangsu Province and transported to Nanjing and Shanghai be allowed to circulate and not be obstructed. If it can be implemented in the near future, the rice shortage problem in Nanjing and Shanghai should be resolved immediately.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] The price limit for rice in the Suzhou rice market is 180,000 yuan, and the black market price is as high as 240,000 yuan. However, most of the rice shops in the city still refuse to sell, and the severity of the grain shortage has reached its peak. Suzhou Women's Normal School, Industrial College, Agricultural School, County High School, and other schools in Suzhou Province, unable to purchase rice, caused a dietary panic, and on the 3rd, they jointly sent personnel to the county government to petition, requesting that the Grain Association purchase rice for one month, totaling more than 1,000 stones. The county government agreed to find a way.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 3rd] The black market price of rice in Suzhou reached a peak of 250,000 yuan per stone today. The city defense headquarters held an emergency meeting today and decided (1) that the price of rice in Suzhou shall not exceed that of Wuxi and shall be calculated at 90% of the price limit in Shanghai; (2) that residents shall not store more than three months' worth of food per household. The Grain and Food Conference's price negotiation is in accordance with the provincial government's regulations, and it is clearly ordered that it can arrive in Suzhou on the 4th.</p>
<p>Anhui</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 3rd] The grain market in Bengbu was crowded on the 3rd, and rice prices went crazy, reaching 430,000 yuan per stone at the close of the market, and flour was 100,000 yuan per bag. Other prices also rose sharply, and people were panicked.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 3rd] In the past two weeks, the price of rice here has risen from 70,000 to 160,000 yuan, and other daily necessities have also doubled in price. The spring famine in central Anhui has reached a severe stage. A few days ago, a rice merchant shipped 200 stones of cooked rice from here to Wuhu by boat, but unexpectedly, when it reached a place 20 miles away from Hefei, it was robbed by starving people. After this case occurred, rice merchants were all afraid to move forward, but the rising trend has not stopped, and the future of public security is quite worrying.</p>
<p>Shanxi</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 2nd] The business market in Taiyuan is chaotic, and the rising trend of grain and cloth is the most severe. The retail price of flour is 150,000 yuan per bag.</p>

<p>Jiangxi</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 3rd] The rice price in the city is 52,000 for subsidized rice and 82,000 (per stone) for government-subsidized rice. However, since large households are unwilling to sell, the afternoon market suddenly rose again, breaking the 100,000 mark, reaching 100,500, and medium-quality rice is 95,000.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Newspapers Resume Publication Today</h3>

The labor side has now expressed its acceptance, and all workers resumed work on the evening of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Grain Merchants Gather to Petition; Start from the Rice Market and Fight Along the Way; News Reporter Taking Photos is Also Beaten and Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 3rd] Yesterday, rice shops in Hangzhou were beaten up until dark, and today another beating scene was staged, and even news reporters were beaten. The grain merchants who were beaten yesterday gathered more than 300 people. This morning, they held flags and marched to the city government to petition, demanding: (1) that the perpetrators who destroyed the rice shops yesterday be severely punished; (2) that the losses be investigated; (3) that the government effectively guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future. They started from the grain market, and because of emotional impulses, they beat rickshaw pullers, egg vendors, and children who were accused of stealing rice along the way, causing a noisy and chaotic scene in the streets. Later, they also smashed the doors, windows, and equipment of the China Restaurant and the China Cafe. At the Lakeside Sino-American Cafe, because they saw that the cafe had a playbill for "Rice Weevil," they became very angry, and stones and wooden sticks flew, and all the facilities were destroyed, causing heavy losses. After the beating, military police arrived and arrested 40 perpetrators. The remaining crowd gathered in front of the city government, demanding the release of all the prisoners, and persisted all day. Shan Yuyue, a reporter from the city's Industry and Commerce Newspaper, was beaten and injured for taking news photos. The rice merchants also shouted in front of the city government to beat the newspaper office, and their frenzy ignored the government and the law. Later, Mayor Zhou met with representatives and promised to release those arrested on bail. However, the grain merchants continued to clamor and did not leave.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Regulates People's Food and Supplies 1,000 Stones Daily</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the city government convened a people's food regulation meeting to discuss the aftermath of yesterday's incident and decided: that the provincial and municipal governments, the Zhejiang Supervisory Envoy's Office, the local court, the procuratorate, the finance department, the field and grain department, and related agencies such as the public association, will form an investigation committee to investigate public and private losses first.

The price per stone will increase from 127,000 to 160,000, with 33,000 of the amount separately submitted as compensation for rice merchants to collect rice in the producing areas. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, but the grain merchants did not leave. Supervisory Envoy Zhu and Jin Runquan and others were forced to retreat and could not go out. At 6:45 PM, after the arrested perpetrators were released on bail, they dispersed. In addition, because there were no rice merchants or rice shops today, only a very small portion of the 2,000 stones of government subsidized rice was sold.</p>

Both the French and Vietnamese sides respect the neutral status of Overseas Chinese. The Vietnamese themselves destroyed their cities, while Overseas Chinese suffered very few casualties. Overseas Chinese refugees are very grateful for the central government's substantial assistance to them after the war. Commercial activities in northern Vietnam are still at a standstill, and most Overseas Chinese have no work. Also, ships between Haiphong, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou Bay are very crowded.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Spirit of the May Fourth Movement</h3>
<p>—Also a Congratulation to the Establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association—</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years have passed since the May Fourth Movement of 1919. Twenty-eight years is nearly a generation. The May Fourth Youth of that time now have white hair and are approaching old age! Today, as we commemorate this great movement, recalling the past, looking at the current situation, and looking forward to the future, we are filled with emotion!</p>
<p>The May Fourth Movement was not only a student movement and a political movement, but also a great educational movement. In the modern history of our country, it was a landmark movement. The May Fourth Movement was triggered by the Paris Peace Conference in April after World War I. On the Shandong issue of China, the Japanese representatives made deceptive promises, verbally allowing the return of military and political control of Shandong to China, but excluding economic control. American President Wilson was deceived, and the representatives of the North and South governments of China were deceived and were preparing to sign the agreement, when the young students of China roared in anger. May Fourth happened to be a Sunday. Initiated by Peking University, it united secondary schools and above to hold a rally and demonstration. The slogan was "Resist foreign powers externally and eliminate national traitors internally." Subsequently, this great movement inspired young students and workers across the country to participate in this patriotic movement, transforming it from a simple student movement into a political movement. Because there was no active political goal, it did not develop for long, and then it transformed from a political movement into a cultural movement and a new thought movement, becoming the most educationally significant and epoch-making movement in modern Chinese history.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years have passed since the May Fourth Movement. Recalling the scene twenty-eight years ago, many things are quite similar to the current situation: First, twenty-eight years ago was exactly when World War I ended and our country won the war. At that time, our country could not be restored as a victorious nation, and we could not stand tall internationally, so we suffered great humiliation at the Paris Peace Conference; second, after the founding of the Republic of China, the war continued unabated, there were governments in both the North and the South, and feudalism still existed in division, leading to corrupt officials and political corruption, so students were dissatisfied with the status quo; third, students were receiving backward education, lacking the input of new ideas and scientific knowledge, so young students developed ideological depression, which led to resentment; fourth, twenty-eight years ago, Japan had a better international environment than us. Britain and France had secret agreements with her, and in diplomacy, she oppressed us in every way. Japan's intention was not only to nibble away at Shandong, but also to annex the Northeast. And today? The world has gone through another world war. We have resisted Japan for eight years. We are already in the position of a victorious nation, and Japan has surrendered unconditionally. Looking around at the current situation, our country's position seems to be very superior, and Japan has already sunk. However, looking forward to the future, there are many hidden reefs. As for the student movement, from the May Fourth to today, the nature and form of the student movement, although different, its emotions and development have always been surging and high, and even more so than in the May Fourth era.</p>
<p>Looking at Japan today. In form, Japan has been defeated, surrendered unconditionally, and obediently obeys the control of the United Nations. In essence, the stubborn thinking of the Japanese has not changed much. In the April elections, conservative forces remained strong. The new constitution was implemented on May 3. The surface article is democracy, but what is the real intention? It is still uncertain. The Japanese have no great affection for China. The Japanese treat MacArthur with humble etiquette, trying to please the United States everywhere. The recent decision to maintain Japan's industrial level from 1930 to 1934, restore its trade, and increase its production is enough to prove the preferential treatment of the United States towards Japan. This style of the United States clearly has other international goals: however, the revival of Japan will ultimately cause trouble in East Asia. This is not a blessing for China, nor is it a blessing for Asia and the ancient world!</p>
<p>Looking at today's student movement, in theory, the student movement is originally a part of the social movement, and it has the same origin as the cultural movement. It grows and supports each other with the evolution of the times. Looking at the current stage of the student movement, several patriotic movements have been earth-shattering, and compared with the May Fourth Movement, they are indeed even better. Therefore, today, we cannot but point out that the May Fourth Movement is a glorious and great undertaking created by Chinese students; although the era of the May Fourth has passed, the spirit of the May Fourth continues to this day and will shine, which is worthy of our cherishing. However, the environment of the May Fourth era still exists today, which is worthy of our vigilance.</p>
<p>In addition, we must solemnly point out that the essence of the May Fourth Movement is not only a political movement, but also a new cultural movement, which initially originated from the new literary movement. The Shanghai Literary Writers Association is specifically established today, which has great significance. Today, we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, and at the same time, we congratulate the establishment of the Shanghai Literary Writers Association!</p>

<h3>US-Soviet Joint Commission to Reconvene This Month on the 20th to Discuss the Issue of Korean Unification; Marshall Replies, Clarifying the US Position; Copies Sent Separately to the Governments of the Two Countries in England</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] Marshall has accepted Molotov's suggestion to reconvene the US-Soviet Joint Commission in Seoul on the 20th of this month to establish a provisional Korean democratic government. However, Marshall requested the Soviet side to clarify the basis on which the Joint Commission will resume its work in the future. In his reply today, Marshall mentioned the Soviet Foreign Minister's statement that the work of the Joint Commission would be based "solely on the implementation of the Moscow Agreement regarding Korea." In order to avoid future misunderstandings regarding this statement, Marshall told Molotov that the US will not refuse any democratic parties or social groups in Korea to consult with the committee when the Joint Commission organizes the provisional government, thereby organizing the provisional government. Marshall also clarified the statement in his letter to Molotov on April 18 regarding the US's special position on Korea, saying that the Joint Commission should expedite its work in accordance with the Moscow Agreement, and that it should be based on respect for democratic rights of freedom of speech. Marshall said that no party should be rejected because of its current or past opinions on the future Korean government. Marshall asked Molotov to reply as soon as possible regarding the mutual agreement between the two countries on this point so that preparations could be made for the convening of the meeting. Marshall's letter to Molotov was copied to China and England. The State Department stated that it hopes that the meeting date of May 20 can be determined. When Marshall reviewed the three points raised by Molotov regarding the relevant part of the Moscow Agreement on Korea, he agreed that (1) the establishment of a provisional democratic government of Korea should be based on the broad participation of various democratic parties and social groups, and Korea should not be controlled by foreign forces and should be a member of the United Nations; (2) the establishment of central, provincial and local democratic government institutions should be chosen by free elections; (3) the United States' plans for Korean economic recovery, education, and political development are already under consideration, so it welcomes the Soviet Union's guarantee to restore Korea to a democratic country and to assist in the development of its economy and culture.</p>

<h3>The Situation of the French Cabinet is Serious; The Fate of the Cabinet May be Decided Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 2nd] The French Parliament is scheduled to vote on the confidence motion of Prime Minister Ramadier's coalition government at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th. Tonight, there are various indications that in the midst of the serious cabinet crisis, some compromise may be reached with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] The dispute between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party over wage and price policies has not yet been resolved. Prime Minister Ramadier asked the parliament tonight to vote on a motion of confidence in his wage and price policies, and stated on the spot that if the parliament agrees with his views, he will continue to implement this policy; otherwise, he will ask someone else to take on this responsibility. He also said that the Republic is in danger, so he hopes everyone will help. Observers believe that this is nothing more than a final appeal to the Communist Party to avoid the collapse of the coalition cabinet. Communist Party members have not yet expressed their views on the confidence vote. It is expected that no matter how things develop, Communist Party cabinet members will not resign. However, if a solution is not reached before Sunday, Ramadier may have to submit the resignation of the entire cabinet. Some observers believe that the Communist Party's criticism of the government's economic policies is just an excuse. The main motive for the Communist Party's preparation to retreat into the opposition party camp is still international factors. The Communist Party has realized that the current government of France has become increasingly inclined towards Britain and the United States and is moving away from the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Analysis of the U.S. Aid to Turkey Plan</h3>
<p>Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Once the U.S. Congress approves President Truman's request to lend Turkey $150 million, Turkey will become a strong forward base to prevent the expansion of Soviet power into the Middle East. The main purpose of this funding is for military facilities and strategic improvements.</p>
<p>The Turkish national defense, which is poorly equipped, should be modernized so that a portion of the troops can be assigned to civilian jobs. Turkey's seaports, railways, highways, and airfields must be improved to cope with large-scale military operations. To make Turkey's steel and coal self-sufficient, its steel and fuel industries need better equipment.</p>
<p>This sweeping U.S. plan surprised even the Turkish government and the British government. No wonder officials in London and Ankara praised the U.S. proposal as a "revolutionary" measure that will certainly be effective in the Mediterranean, the Near East, and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Turkey Needs Spiritual Assistance</p>
<p>Turkey's current situation requires spiritual assistance and military equipment more urgently than money. Since the end of the European War, Turkey has been under constant pressure from the Soviet Union, forcing it to cede the privileges of the Dardanelles Strait, which connects the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has also applied various pressures, including: formal demands, newspaper and radio attacks on the Turkish government, and suggestions that Turkey should cede the eastern provinces of Kars and Ardahan to the Soviet Union. Turkey must maintain an army of about one million men, about four percent of the total population. Military expenditures account for almost 60 percent of Turkey's budget. Therefore, the basic improvement of Turkey's economic resources has had to be postponed.</p>
<p>No Communist Party Exists</p>
<p>Last year's election recognized an opposition party, which is an unprecedented event in modern Turkish history. However, Foreign Minister Saka remained in office, indicating that Turkey's determination to reject Soviet demands has not changed as a result of the election. There is no Communist Party in Turkey, and the activities of the left wing are virtually impossible to carry out due to strict government surveillance.</p>
<p>Turkey is not in as dire a financial crisis as Greece. The amount of Turkey's budget expenditures is not large and can be compensated for by internal loans. The recent devaluation of the Turkish currency has greatly increased exports. The United States is Turkey's largest customer, followed by the United Kingdom. Turkey has gold reserves and has received $40 million in loans from the United States since the outbreak of the war for the purchase of industrial equipment, surplus materials, and merchant ships.</p>
<p>The cessation of British aid to Turkey will not have a significant economic impact. In 1939, the United Kingdom lent Turkey $40 million under the Anglo-French-Turkish Treaty, which Turkey did not default on. The United Kingdom supplied Turkey with $100 million worth of military supplies on credit during the war. The United Kingdom has not lent money to Turkey since the war. In fact, the United Kingdom owes Turkey for not paying the gold pound difference in London? Aside from government aid, Britain's greatest contribution to Turkey after the war has been the dispatch of a military mission, which originally had 33 officers and has now increased to 60.</p>
<p>U.S. Aid to Turkey to Be Implemented in Stages</p>
<p>The U.S. aid to Turkey plan will be implemented gradually until the crisis is resolved. Not all funds will be delivered at once. According to the current plan, military equipment will be supplied to Turkey first to reduce the manpower engaged in national defense work. Turkey needs radar, anti-aircraft guns, motor vehicles, tanks, coastal patrol boats, transport aircraft, and fighter planes. Some light vessels can be modified to enhance the strength of the Turkish Navy. Airfields must be rearranged to accommodate nighttime landings and heavy bomber landings.</p>
<p>The training of Turkish soldiers will be carried out simultaneously with the supply of military equipment. The U.S. military mission will train Turks in military technology so that they can use modern weapons. In addition, it has been suggested that Turkey be supplied with machines to improve basic industries and transportation infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Improvement Plan Covers a Wide Range</p>
<p>Turkey had long planned to borrow $500 million from the United States, but before President Truman announced his new policy, Turkey's hope of obtaining a large loan was very slim. The Turks intend to improve the two seaports of Zonguldak and Trabzon on the Black Sea coast. They want to convert the railway from the Turkish capital Ankara to Istanbul into a double track, replace old vehicles with new ones, and extend the railway line to Iraq and Iran. They hope to increase the supply of hydropower in the Ankara, Izmir, and Adana areas and improve the machinery of coal mines and steel mills.</p>
<p>The U.S. steps to aid Turkey are intended to first implement the parts of the aid to Turkey plan that are most critical for national defense. If Turkey can obtain more loans, it also hopes to replace dilapidated textile machinery, build new highways, and expand irrigation areas.</p>
<p>Turkey Is Determined to Resist the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Turkey is the strongest anti-communist country on the Soviet border and deserves U.S. support as much as Greece. This is the basic strategy of the U.S. aid to Turkey plan. The Turks believe that the U.S. announcement of the aid to Turkey plan has greatly enhanced Turkey's position against the Soviet Union. Turkey hopes to demobilize a portion of its vast army as resources become available. When the entire plan is completed, Turkey will become a strong military base against future threats from the Soviet Union. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)</p>
<h3>The First Report of the Five-Power Military Staff Committee Is Released, Soviet Views Differ Greatly from Those of the Other Four Powers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: The contents of the first report of the United Nations Five-Power Military Staff Committee have been released. Of the 41 articles outlining the organization of the world's peacekeeping forces, one-third were opposed by the Soviet Union. The report consists of approximately 80 pages and is the result of a month of secret discussions. France agreed with the Soviet Union on three points, while China and the United Kingdom shared the same views as the United States. The report will be discussed by the Security Council. The revelation of its contents confirms that the views of the Soviet Union and the other powers are far apart. The Soviet Union believes that there is no explicit provision in the United Nations Charter for any country to establish bases for the United Nations military forces. China, the United Kingdom, and the United States say that without such bases, the establishment of peacekeeping forces would be futile. The Soviet Union demands that all United Nations military forces return to their home territories within 30 to 90 days after completing their missions. The other powers expressed their opposition. In addition, there are several other points on which the Soviet Union's views do not coincide with those of the other countries.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] It was revealed here today that the five powers have agreed to allocate "the best-trained and best-equipped" armed forces as the United Nations' global police force. However, the Soviet Union and Western countries differ greatly in their views on the principles of the United Nations' peace maintenance. Complete agreement on the United Nations military force negotiations may take months, even years. These negotiations began 15 months ago at the United Nations Military Staff Committee.</p>
<h3>Stolen Deadly Poison, Tokyo Citizens Panic</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] The theft of 36 kilograms of potassium cyanide from a factory in Saitama Prefecture, northwest of Tokyo, has caused great panic among the people of Tokyo. Police fear that the thieves may have mistakenly sold the poison as flour. 36 kilograms of potassium cyanide could poison all the citizens of Tokyo. Tokyo health authorities have mobilized to search door-to-door. At the same time, two testing stations have been set up. All flour must be sent there for testing before production. All bakers in the city must analyze the flour before making bread. To prevent thieves from pouring the poison into the river, health authorities test the river water every three hours. Although Tokyo police and health authorities have made every effort to search, the poison has not yet been found.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Polish Relations Improve</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 3rd] It was announced here this morning that the British government only recognizes the legitimate government of Poland and has no relationship with the former Polish government-in-exile in London.</p>
<h3>Jewish Representatives Only Allowed to Present Their Case to the Committee, UN Steering Committee Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] The United Nations Special General Assembly will meet at 4:00 p.m. today to discuss the issue of Jewish representatives' attendance. The Steering Committee last night voted 11-0, with the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia abstaining, that Jewish representatives should not be allowed to attend the General Assembly but only to present their views to the committee. If this recommendation is accepted by the General Assembly, it will be submitted to the 55-nation Political Committee for discussion. The Political Committee currently has only one item on its agenda, namely the organization and terms of reference of the Palestine Investigation Committee, which is expected to begin discussion tomorrow. After the investigation committee is established, it will be engaged in drafting a report, which will be submitted to the General Assembly's regular session in September for review and a decision on how to deal with it. According to Secretary-General Trygve Lie, four Jewish groups have requested to send representatives to speak.</p>
<p>Divergent Views Among Countries, We Support U.S. Proposal</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 2nd] The views of the four powers have diverged on the question of whether the Jewish people should be allowed to participate in the discussion of the current session of the United Nations Special General Assembly. British representative Cadogan first stated in the Steering Committee that since the Arab countries have entered into a full discussion of the Palestine issue at the Special General Assembly, Jewish representatives should be allowed to attend and present their views without conflicting with the law. U.S. representative Austin expressed his opposition. He believed that the Steering Committee should recommend to the entire General Assembly that all requests from the Jewish people be referred to the Political Committee, and that the Political Committee should find appropriate opportunities for the Jewish people to present their views. Mr. Austin further stated that the Jewish representatives should be limited to the Jewish Agency, and their representatives should not be able to present their views to the entire General Assembly. China expressed its support for the U.S. view, but Soviet representative Gromyko believed that the U.S. representative's view was unfair. He believed that not only should Jewish representatives be allowed to present their views to the entire General Assembly, but the Steering Committee should also review the requests of all Jewish groups other than the Jewish Agency. United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie also joined the discussion, saying that in the past, requests from non-United Nations member states to participate in the General Assembly had all been rejected. If the Steering Committee recommends that the entire General Assembly hear the views of non-governmental organizations, it would be a violation of precedent. Representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia spoke out, both advocating that representatives of the Jewish Agency be allowed to attend the entire General Assembly and present their views. Indian representative Ali argued that not only should Jewish representatives be allowed to present their views, but representatives of the residents of Palestine should also be allowed to present their views.</p>

<h3>Minister Gu Takes Plan Back to Beijing, Says Cost of Living Index Freeze May Be Lifted Conditionally, Plans to Have Specific Calculation Methods for Salaries, Suggests Central Government Approve and Implement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Minister Gu Zhengwang of the Ministry of Social Affairs returned to Beijing by train last night after completing his official duties. Minister Gu has been soliciting opinions from both labor and management in this city for several days, and after consulting with Mayor Wu and Director Wu, he has decided to recommend to the Central Government that the cost of living index freeze be lifted in principle. However, in order to reduce the burden on the industrial sector, a method will be adopted whereby the base number is calculated in full according to the index, and the percentage will be gradually reduced above that level. Multiple plans have been drafted, with attached charts for explanation, which will be carried back to Beijing by Minister Gu and presented to the Central Government for selection and decision. Minister Gu told reporters that the labor sector in this city believes that the current price increases make it impossible for workers to maintain their livelihood and demands that the cost of living index be unfrozen, or at least that the index be unfrozen conditionally. He also convened leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors today to discuss the issue, and they expressed sympathy for the workers' hardship. However, they expressed that the recession in the industrial sector itself is also very serious, and they hope that the government can pay attention to maintaining the industry and stabilizing the lives of workers, taking both into consideration. On the issue of lifting the index freeze, the opinions of labor and management have converged in principle. The technical issues after the freeze is lifted have now been studied with Mayor Wu and Director Wu, and preliminary specific measures have also been decided. However, the freezing of the index is a central government decision, and local authorities cannot change it without central approval. The Municipal Government will jointly suggest it to the Central Government within days. It is deeply believed that protecting the lives of workers is an established national policy of the government, and this suggestion will be adopted and implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Small Group Meeting of Labor-Management Evaluation Committee Plans to Come Up with Multiple Specific Measures</p>
<p>In order to solicit opinions and formulate plans for Minister Gu to bring to the central government for reference and adoption, the Small Group Meeting of the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee on the Cost of Living Index Issue held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau Conference Room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the issue of lifting the index freeze. The specialized committee members present were Shang Xuexiang, Tian Heqing, Li Kaidi, Fan CaiKui, Xia Enlin, Zhao Banfu, Shui Xiangyun, Dong Rengui, Wang Ziyang, Zhang Zhusan, and Ye Xianggao. Fan Zhenbang, Ling Mozhen, and Xu Lin attended as observers. Director Wu served as chairman. After three hours of discussion, multiple specific measures were drafted. Director Wu Chang telegraphed the said measures to Minister Gu and Mayor Wu in advance, and Minister Gu carried them to Beijing last night to present them to the highest authorities for approval.</p>
<p>Base Salary Rumored to Be 30 Yuan</p>
<p>According to Director Wu, the small group meeting formulated a plan based on the opinions of the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Federation of Trade Unions, and decided to conditionally lift the index freeze from May. It can be announced after the central government approves it.</p>
<p>It is learned that the so-called "conditional" means that the base salary is actually paid according to the index if it is below the specified base number, and the portion exceeding the specified base number is actually paid at a discount according to the index. The base salary is likely to start at 30 yuan on the worker's side. The reason for this decision is to take into account the ability of some employers to bear the burden, so as not to be unable to bear the burden due to the sudden lifting of the freeze and the increase in wages.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West District Cotton Textile Workers' Union Petitions the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Director Wu Says the Matter Can Be Resolved This Month</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai West District Cotton Textile Workers' Union, representing 45,000 workers from 28 units, demanded that the indexation freeze be lifted starting from April. They threatened to strike at 2:00 PM on the 5th if their demand was not met. The union's directors and supervisors, feeling unable to control the agitated workers, convened a joint meeting of all unions at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. They immediately dispatched over ten representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, which was in session. At 7:00 PM that evening, another joint meeting was held. Zhang Zhusan, the representative of the General Labor Union who attended the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee meeting, reported that a method for lifting the freeze had been agreed upon and would be announced after approval from the central government. He urged everyone not to take rash actions.</p>
<p>A reporter then visited Wu, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to inquire about the workers' demand to lift the indexation freeze starting from April. Director Wu replied: "The law does not punish past actions. I am responsible for resolving this issue starting from May. If the workers insist on implementing it starting from April, then I will not be threatened," and so forth.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union also convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its headquarters yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to strive for the lifting of the indexation freeze. It was resolved to invite representatives from postal workers' unions across the country to hold a joint meeting in Beijing on the 15th to discuss the direction forward.</p>

<h3>The War Prisoners Management Office: Closure Is Still Pending</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Jiangwan War Prisoners Management Office, which was originally scheduled to close at the end of June this year, will reportedly be extended because war prisoners are still being sent in successively from various locations, and the repatriation work still needs to be carried out. At the same time, the Japanese war criminals detained in the war criminals detention center, although being tried successively by military tribunals, will be difficult to complete all trials in a short time, and the War Prisoners Management Office will still be responsible for the duty of detention and guarding. As for the Japanese technical personnel remaining in China, they have now been transferred to the responsibility of the Municipal Government for unified management. Those who have no need to remain in China or have other intentions have been investigated separately and will be repatriated to their country in the short term.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Industry Hold Talks, Acknowledge That Difficulty in Obtaining Foreign Exchange and Raw Materials is the Crux of Rising Prices, Sympathize with the Need to Adjust Workers' Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, in order to understand the actual situation of the current industry, convened a talk with various industrial trade associations in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. Over 40 responsible persons from the electrical equipment industry, papermaking industry, textile industry, rubber industry, and other industries attended. During the meeting, Minister Gu elaborated on three points: (1) Actively exert the power of each industry to ensure the future and seek development. (2) It is necessary to overcome economic difficulties, and the government and the people, labor and capital, and workers must cooperate to break through the difficulties. (3) The government is studying countermeasures to address labor issues in order to seek social stability. Subsequently, representatives of various industries broadly exchanged views on the current prices, wages, organization, and business. They provided very detailed descriptions of the problems of foreign exchange and import management, wage adjustments, bureaucratic capital using privileges, and destroying the economy. Most believed that the industrial sector's inability to directly obtain foreign exchange to purchase the required raw materials and materials is the biggest difficulty for the current industrial sector and the biggest crux of rising prices. Regarding the issue of workers' wages, many believed that since the indexation freeze, there has been a significant disconnect from prices, which affects work efficiency and causes social unrest, so reasonable adjustments should be made.</p>
<p>Minister Gu Concludes with Seven Points</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Gu concluded with seven points: (1) Report bureaucratic capital using privileges to illegally obtain foreign exchange. (2) Those who do not join the association should be stopped from operating in accordance with the law, and this point should be strictly enforced by the Social Affairs Bureau. (3) Protect industry and prohibit the use of violence to destroy productive enterprises. (4) Promote the spirit of democracy, implement a democratic style, to fight for their own interests and supervise officials to protect their interests with their own strength. (5) The Industrial Association Law must be based on the consistent stance in the past to complete the legislative process to meet the needs. It is especially hoped that industry and commerce will cooperate to generate a complementary effect. (6) The problem of unemployed workers should be solved by factory owners and the government cooperating to seek a solution. (7) It is very necessary for industrial groups to hold monthly meetings. Beijing and Shanghai are close at hand, and I am very willing to participate often to establish closer ties with various industrialists. The talks ended at about 1:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Second Day of the District Government Symposium: The Focus of the Discussion is on Issues Such as Food, Corruption, and Rent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's district government symposium continued to be held for the second day yesterday, still presided over by Speaker Pan. Seventeen people attended, including the chairmen of the district representatives' conferences, deputy district heads, and municipal councilors elected from the four districts of Songshan, Penglai, Luwan, and Yimiao. The focus of the discussion included the following issues:</p>
<p>Food Imports Should Be Considered</p>
<p>(1) Suppressing Prices: The representatives believed that the municipal government's measure of selling rice to suppress rice prices was not as effective as adopting a method of allocating grain based on population, which would directly benefit the common people more. Speaker Pan indicated that the authorities have also considered this. Then, Councilor Shi Zongde stood up and loudly exclaimed: "In the second quota allocation table of the Import Management Committee, the quota for rice and wheat is only 7 million US dollars, while the quota for tobacco leaves is 8 million US dollars. What is the reason for this? Is it that rice and wheat, on which the people rely for food, are not as important as tobacco?" He requested that the central government reconsider this quota policy.</p>
<p>Rent Standards Should Be Re-Established</p>
<p>(2) Housing Rent Issues: Also a central topic of discussion yesterday, it was felt that rent standards should be re-established urgently to avoid disputes, but simply setting a multiple is quite unreasonable. For example, the land prices and real estate in Huangpu District cannot be compared with the land prices in Longhua District, so following the principles of Article 97 of the Land Law is more reasonable, but its provision of a maximum amount calculated at 10% of interest is still too high, because before the war, the general real estate rent in Shanghai, calculated on an annual interest basis, did not reach 3-4%.</p>
<p>Privately Built Shanties Easily Cause Fires</p>
<p>(3) Fire Prevention: There are many shanties in Nanshi. These shanties mostly use tar paper as roofs. Once a fire breaks out, the fragments fly everywhere, forming an uncontrollable situation and making rescue difficult. Therefore, to solve the fire problem, prohibiting the private construction of shanties and suspending shanty construction licenses is an urgent priority. It was also found that after fires occur in Nanshi, the fire hydrants often cannot discharge water smoothly because the water company fails to provide a sufficient supply. This point should also be brought to the attention of the authorities.</p>
<p>Finally, Speaker Pan stated that he hoped that the third general meeting of the district people's representatives' conferences could be convened before the third general meeting of the council, so that councilors could attend and listen to opinions from all sides, so that they could be submitted to the council for reference.</p>
<h3>Former Municipal Government Chongqing Office Personnel Zhang Yuren and Others Accused of Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Yuren, the former director of the Municipal Government's Chongqing Office, deputy director Wu Jingsen, Public Works Bureau representative Zhang Baoming, Land Bureau representative Chen Zicai, and Finance Bureau representative Wu Boqi were recently accused of corruption by Tang Mingshi, the chief secretary of the Public Works Bureau. It was said that when Zhang and others hired a special ship to transport the families of municipal government personnel to Shanghai at the beginning of the victory the year before last, they took advantage of their positions to sell Mo shi tickets and deduct the cost of food on the ship, openly engaging in bribery and other actions. Yesterday morning, the District Procuratorate held a court hearing, summoning the defendants and accusers for interrogation, and all were ordered to return after the interrogation.</p>
<h3>Music Group Manager Accused of Abandonment, Brings Luggage to Court and Firmly Asks to Be Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Deng Shiping, the manager of the Chinese Music Group, which is about to perform the "Meng Jiangnv" opera in the United States, was recently accused of abandonment by his wife, Chu Jingru, to the Women's Movement Committee of the Municipal Party Department. The case has been transferred by the Women's Movement Committee to the District Procuratorate. The presiding prosecutor summoned Deng for interrogation yesterday afternoon. Deng arrived at the court at 2:00 PM, carrying a blue cloth bundle containing bedding, underwear, and other daily necessities, saying that he was prepared to be detained in prison. After the prosecutor interrogated him, he offered to release him on bail. Deng firmly requested to be detained. After persuasion from the bailiff, he quickly left to find bail.</p>

<h3>Literary and Artistic Writers Association to be Established Today, General Assembly to be Presided Over by Zhang Daofan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Literary and Artistic Writers Association, in view of the fact that most general cultural groups operate individually and fail to cooperate and develop with relevant social institutions, has drafted future business guidelines during the preparatory period, based on the principles of "the group is more important than the individual, practice is more important than theory, organization is power, and mutual assistance and cooperation are the foundation of the cause." It will also establish connections and close cooperation with cultural undertakings such as education, news, publishing, drama, film, art, and music in the city, as well as relevant agencies and groups. The planned events include: 1. Writer fellowship and gathering activities. 2. Improving writer welfare and assisting members' further education. 3. Evaluation and recommendation of members' works. 4. Assisting young writers in literary and artistic writing. It is reported that the association is ready and will hold its inaugural meeting at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the articles of association, issue a declaration, and determine the future work program. Zhang Daofan, the standing director of the General Association, will personally preside over the meeting. There will also be music, singing, recitation, and other entertainment programs. In the evening, Zhang Daofan will broadcast a speech in this newspaper on "The Significance of Commemorating the May Fourth Movement and the Establishment of the Shanghai Literary and Artistic Writers Association."</p>
<h3>New-Style Postal Booths Set Up at the Bund Racecourse</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In order to facilitate citizens' mailing, the Shanghai Postal Bureau has decided to set up two new-style postal booths recently in front of Nanjing Road, the Bund, and the Racecourse. The business includes selling tickets and receiving and sending registered mail. There will also be a telegraph operator stationed inside, dispatched by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, to facilitate citizens sending and receiving telegrams. The bureau has obtained the approval of the Public Utilities Bureau for the land occupied by these postal booths. In addition, since the bureau implemented the postal zoning delivery system last month, it has not achieved significant results because the general public is not yet accustomed to it. It has recently decided to send personnel to the major companies, shops, and newspaper offices that send the most mail to register postal codes on their behalf, and to send letters to printing companies requesting them to add postal codes when printing envelopes for various institutions and groups in order to promote the system widely.</p>

<h3>Shi Chunxuan Sued, Cries "Aiya" Upon Hearing the Verdict, Tested for Opium Addiction, Cries Injustice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Shi Chunxuan, who calls himself the "King of Shenqu," was forced by six unidentified people on March 29 to go to the Yipinxian Hotel to negotiate, saying that someone had accused him of smoking opium, resulting in him being defrauded of 4 million legal tender. The police bureau learned of the matter and immediately went to Shi Chunxuan's house to search the next day. Although nothing was found, the police bureau believed that Shi was indeed suspected of drug use and sent him to the hospital for examination. The examination revealed that Shi Chunxuan was indeed addicted to opium, so he was sent to the District Court for trial as a special criminal case. Judge Shen Tianbao opened the trial yesterday and sentenced him to one year and four months in prison, with a two-month deadline to quit opium addiction. Shi cried "Aiya" upon hearing the verdict, closed his eyes tightly, and then fell backward. The bailiffs and court clerks quickly helped him up. Shi slowly woke up, jumping around with his feet, and repeatedly shouted injustice.</p>
<h3>High Court Reviews the Case of Meisberg, the Defendant Contends for Position in Zhu Ying Bank, Claims That 20,000 Hong Kong Dollars Was Not a Deposit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The "Foreign Tiger" Dutchman Meisberg was detained by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and sent to the District Court for legal action on March 3 because his Ebbs Company (in the Xinfeng Company, Room 118 of the Sassoon Building on Nanjing Road) was engaged in black market foreign exchange, buying and selling foreign currency, and violating emergency economic measures. The District Court sentenced Meisberg to one year in prison on April 14. Meisberg refused to accept this and appealed to the High Court, while the District Procuratorate prosecutor Quan Dian also believed that the original trial sentence was too light and appealed to the High Court. The case was heard in the High Court at 9:00 AM yesterday. Anderson, the Deputy Consul of the US Consulate General in Shanghai, legal advisor Zhang Tiansa, and Dutch Consul General Mitterdeng all attended the hearing. Meisberg's lawyers Chen Tingrui and Cai Rudong, and Xie Chunpu, the accountant hired by the Garrison Headquarters to review the accounts, also attended the hearing. Liu Yugui, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court, judges Wang Kequan and Han Shuzhi, and prosecutor Yang Ruicheng took their seats in the Criminal Court One, and the bailiffs brought Meisberg before the court. The court first asked Meisberg his age and origin. He replied that he was 55 years old, Dutch, residing at No. 433 Haig Road, and a foreign exchange broker. Judge Liu then informed him that today was for investigating evidence, and since you have filed an appeal, the prosecutor has also filed an appeal at the same time. First, let the prosecutor state the reasons for the appeal.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Yang's Argument</p>
<p>Prosecutor Yang Ruicheng then stood up and said: "The reasons for the appeal have been detailed in the appeal document. Now, I will briefly explain them. In February, due to the soaring prices of gold and banknotes, which affected the rising prices of goods, the government promulgated emergency measures. The defendant did not comply with the laws and continued to engage in black market foreign exchange transactions. The original trial determined that the defendant was a foreigner and did not understand Chinese law, so he was sentenced to one year in prison. However, it was found that the defendant had been doing business in Shanghai for a long time and was very familiar with the situation in China, so the determination of the original trial was inappropriate. This is the first reason for not accepting the original judgment. Also, the original trial determined that the foreign exchange operated by the defendant could not be regarded as the foreign currency referred to in the emergency economic measures and was not dealt with. However, it was found that the foreign exchange operated by the defendant was all denominated in foreign currencies, which undoubtedly belonged to the operation of foreign currency. The original trial did not deal with this, which was also inappropriate. This is the second reason for not accepting the original judgment. Based on these two reasons, this prosecutor believes that the original judgment was too light and requests the court to revoke the original judgment and make a more appropriate judgment."</p>
<p>The Defendant Denies Guilt</p>
<p>Subsequently, Meisberg said: "The original court, based on Article 7 of the emergency economic measures, determined that the appellant received 20,000 Hong Kong dollars on February 25 as a deposit, which was an act of operating a bank, and sentenced the appellant to imprisonment based on Article 7 of the plan. However, this 20,000 Hong Kong dollars was not a deposit, but a deposit for a customer to buy and sell foreign exchange with New York Lei'e Company. After the transaction was completed, it had to be returned to the original owner. The appellant was only a broker, and Ebbs Company never accepted deposits. The original trial treated it as a bank for conviction and sentencing, which was obviously inappropriate. It is requested that the court pronounce a judgment of innocence." At this point, lawyer Chen Tingrui stood up and added: "After the defendant filed an appeal, your court immediately conducted a hearing, so the statement of reasons for appeal has not yet been submitted and will be submitted later. Whether the legal provisions of the economic emergency measures cited in this case have completed the legislative procedures will be explained in detail in the appeal statement in the future. Now, I will briefly supplement the facts. The original court determined that the defendant was engaged in banking business and convicted him accordingly. It should be known that the emergency economic measures refer to formal banks, so at the end of the text, there is a statement about revoking the license. Moreover, the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars of deposit received by the defendant was a deposit for buying and selling foreign exchange with New York Lei'e Company. The original trial translation was incorrect, treating it as a deposit and convicting him accordingly, which is really difficult to accept."</p>
<p>Account Review Process</p>
<p>Subsequently, accountant Xie Chunpu stood up and reported on the account review process of Ebbs Company, saying that he received a phone call from the Garrison Headquarters on the evening of March 1 to check the accounts. After three days of effort, the report was prepared on the 6th. All the income and expenditure accounts of Ebbs Company were listed in the report. He asked Meisberg, who admitted that the report was correct. Lawyer Chen stood up and asked accountant Xie three questions: (1) Was the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars a deposit or a comfort fund? (2) Did Ebbs Company have deposits of a banking nature? (3) From an accounting point of view, what kind of company was Ebbs Company? Accountant Xie said: (1) After investigation, the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars was a deposit. (2) The company had no deposits of a banking nature. (3) The company was not registered with our government, but was registered in the United States as a draft company. Whether it is of a banking nature cannot be determined.</p>
<p>Testimonies are Mostly the Same</p>
<p>Subsequently, bookkeeper Portuguese Pabotistai, cashier Shi Jiusen, bookkeeper Shao Shunqin, assistant Portuguese Kangpaishi, and transaction officer Portuguese Baotailiya were summoned, and their testimonies were mostly the same. Finally, lawyer Chen requested a suspension of the detention. The court said that it was necessary to apply with a statement and the collegiate panel would make a ruling. It also requested that the defendant be returned to the Masnan Road Detention Center to facilitate the delivery of meals, which was approved by the court. Judge Liu said: "This case is scheduled to open an oral debate court at 9:30 AM on the 10th, and the trial will conclude then." Yesterday, the trial lasted for four hours, and the court adjourned at 1:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Forging Transportation Company Seals to Impersonate Bundle of Banknotes for Fraud</h3>
<p>The police officers of the Songshan Precinct arrested a person in a room in a certain hotel in the Hongyunfang on Ninghai West Road the day before yesterday. He was seen sealing bundles of banknotes. On the table were more than ten pieces of seals of "Shanghai Public Transport Company Transportation Group Business Office" and cash of 500,000 in one bundle. The above seals were affixed on it. After the police officers opened it for inspection, the actual amount was only 250,000 yuan, and half of the intermediate was mixed with small tickets of 500 yuan. Then, a large leather wallet was searched under his bed, containing three pieces of suit material. He was immediately arrested. According to the confession, his name is Lin Mengnan, 21 years old, from Zhejiang, unemployed. He admitted that he was going to deposit the insufficient amount of banknotes into the current deposit account of the Savings Department of the Bank of China. In order to avoid the inspection by the bank staff, he affixed the seals. When asked where he bought the suit material, he replied that he also obtained it from a certain suit shop using this method, but he had forgotten the shop number, and the rest of his confession was ambiguous. Lin was wearing a suit and had a lavish demeanor. He was immediately taken to the police station along with the stolen goods for investigation, and then sent to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Joint Anti-Tuberculosis Committee Launches Student Anti-Tuberculosis Fundraising</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Anti-Tuberculosis Committee held a tea party on the 2nd at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA and the Shanghai Student Relief Association, convened by Yen Hui-ching and Pan Gongzhan, to discuss student anti-tuberculosis fundraising methods. It was decided to use the more than 3,300 university students who had been aided by the Shanghai Student Relief Association as the main force, with each person responsible for inviting two enthusiastic and righteous student leaders from their classmates, forming a fundraising team of 10,000 students. Each person's goal is at least 60,000 yuan, which would yield a total of 600 million yuan. Of this amount, 30% will be donated by the Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee to the Shanghai Student Relief Association as operating expenses, and the remaining 70% will be used for anti-tuberculosis work in the city. There are three types of fundraising: paper badges at 2,000 yuan each, metal badges at 5,000 yuan each, and medical books at 10,000 yuan each. In addition to the anti-tuberculosis paper badges, which will be sold on the streets and in public places on the official fundraising day, the other two types can be sold in advance anywhere, such as homes, stores, and organizations.</p>

<h3>Passenger Jumps to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] At 8 AM yesterday, a man suddenly jumped from the fourth floor of the Dazhong Hotel at the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Fujian South Road, committing suicide. Liu Sugen, a pregnant woman (30 years old, the wife of a sweeper nearby), was passing by and was injured in the waist when she was crushed. A crowd gathered to watch, and a police officer arrived and called an ambulance, which took both injured people to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to a reporter's investigation, the suicide victim was named Wu Zaixian, 40 years old, from Henan Province, and was a solo trader. He was accompanied to the Shanghai Red Cross Hospital by his friend Deng Wenkui on the 20th of last month due to a heart condition. He was discharged from the hospital on the 29th and stayed in Room 430 of the Dazhong Hotel. Recently, his old illness relapsed, and he was unable to seek medical treatment, leading him to have suicidal thoughts. He jumped from the building and committed suicide. Wu died at 5 PM due to severe internal injuries and fractures of the left and right femurs. The injured pregnant woman had minor injuries and was discharged from the hospital after treatment.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Jianghai Bandit Gang, Cai Yifu, Arrested</h3>
<p>Cai Yifu (also known as Cai Xiaoguzi), an accomplice of the Jianghai bandit Sun Xinmin, was arrested by the Seventh Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters in the Wusong area at around 6 PM on the 30th of last month. According to Cai's confession, he is 40 years old, from Funing, and had two Mauser rifles and one Box Cannon hidden in a certain location on a ship. However, when investigators boarded the ship for inspection the day before yesterday, the guns had disappeared, presumably taken away by his accomplices. Cai admitted that he partnered with Sun Xinmin and Zhao Jinshan (one of the bandits who has already been arrested) to transport and sell stolen goods for them. It is said that the stolen goods were handed over to Shunji Xiexing Public North Goods Store in Wusong for resale. Cai is one of the shareholders of the store, which closed down when the Sun Xinmin case was cracked. Manager Li is still at large.</p>

<h3>Social Services, Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>(1) Dissolution of Engagement</p>
<p>Zongcheng asks: A female relative of mine, Miss Jia, was betrothed to Mr. Yi by her parents through a matchmaker when she was seven years old. At that time, in addition to exchanging jewelry and rings, they received an engagement gift of 50 yuan. Now Miss Jia is 24 years old and studying at a university. Because she has different interests from the other party, she firmly opposes this engagement. However, she does not understand the law and has not dared to act rashly. I would like to ask the following questions and would be grateful for your answers: (1) Can she declare this engagement invalid by simply making a public statement? (2) If the other party does not agree to the dissolution, will this hinder her freedom of marriage? (3) Will the person proposing the dissolution have to compensate for any losses? (4) How should the engagement gift be returned? (5) How should she deal with illegal coercion from the other party? (6) If the other party delays and refuses to dissolve the engagement, can the woman choose another spouse, and would this be illegal? (7) What are the steps to resolve this engagement?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] An engagement made by parents for their minor children is naturally invalid and does not need to be dissolved. Therefore, (1) is yes. (2) is no hindrance. (3) In general, the party who is not at fault in dissolving an engagement may request compensation from the party who is at fault for the damages suffered as a result. (4) It can be negotiated by both parties. (5) Sue the court for a ruling. (6) Yes. (7) It is best to have someone mediate.</p>
<p>(2) Concealed Pregnancy</p>
<p>Li Zhizhong asks: I have several legal questions and respectfully request your answers: Mr. Jia is married and has children. He cohabits with a Miss Yi, who, due to her poor family background, often asks Mr. Jia for help. Over time, Miss Yi's daughter gradually developed feelings for Mr. Jia, and later a physical relationship occurred. However, the daughter is engaged to Mr. Bing (the daughter is 19 years old) and is now pregnant. Please advise (1) whether Mr. Jia's behavior constitutes the crime of interfering with a family or offending public morals? (2) Can Mr. Bing sue Mr. Jia for seduction? (3) If Mr. Jia's wife is willing for Miss Yi to cohabit with them, can the engagement between the daughter and Mr. Bing be dissolved?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin answers] If Yi and Jia are having an affair, and it is initiated by Yi, it does not constitute abduction. If Jia did not cause Yi to leave her family or other persons with supervisory authority, it does not constitute the crime of enticing her away. Bing cannot sue Jia, except that Jia’s wife can sue him for adultery. If Jia’s wife tolerates or pardons the affair, she cannot sue either. As for the engagement between Yi and Bing, Bing may claim dissolution due to Yi's affair with Jia and may request compensation for losses. If Yi claims dissolution, Bing's consent must be obtained, but Bing may not request compulsory performance.</p>

<h3>High Procuratorate Returns Huang Bohui Assassination Case for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The assassination case of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Times, had been concluded by the local procuratorate, which found that the defendant Zheng Desheng had no suspicion of inciting murder and dismissed the case. The plaintiff Huang Bohui disagreed and applied to the High Procuratorate for reconsideration and provided evidence. The High Procuratorate has now completed its investigation and believes that Huang Bohui's application is justified and should be reinvestigated. The entire case file was returned to the local procuratorate yesterday. The reasons are roughly as follows: The plaintiff submitted an X-ray photograph explanation and the diagnosis of Dr. Zhang Qubing from Wuzhou Pharmacy, stating that the depressed fracture of the parietal bone on the right side of the plaintiff's head may have been caused by a gunshot wound, while the forensic examination in the original investigation stated that it was not caused by a gunshot wound. The High Procuratorate believes there is a big difference and the Prosecutor can entrust the hospital to conduct an expert determination in accordance with Article 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. At the same time, they attach great importance to the assassin identified by the plaintiff, Gai Siweituo, and the High Court prosecutor believes that Gai is indeed a major suspect. Defendant Zheng Desheng is currently in custody, and the local procuratorate will begin the reinvestigation of the case within the next week.</p>

<h3>Shanghai University Professors' Association Cables Executive Yuan Requesting Adjustment of Salaries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors' Association recently sent a telegram to Executive Yuan President Zhang and Minister of Education Zhu, stating: "Recently, due to soaring prices and the depreciation of currency, the lives of professors have become increasingly difficult. According to official statistics, the price increase rate has exceeded 20,000 times, while the income of teachers has not reached 2,000 times. With this meager income, it is impossible to cope with soaring prices, and even the most basic living needs cannot be met. We, as respected teachers, bearing the heavy responsibility of education, are unable to support our parents or raise our children. We are mentally and physically exhausted and helpless. Our current lives are heartbreaking to talk about! Therefore, the Association has decided to request that the salaries of professors be reasonably adjusted immediately to alleviate our suffering. Otherwise, forced by livelihood concerns, we will inevitably seek other means of survival, or even stop teaching due to hunger. The future of education is a matter of great concern."</p>

<h3>Paper Shortage Leads to Book Famine, Awaiting Relief from the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>The national paper import allocation method is quite slow. In the book industry, since the adoption of the quota system for paper last winter, the first paper quota has only been settled, and it will not be imported until after August. This will not alleviate the urgent need for paper for textbooks in the fall semester. Some publishers in the city have to purchase spot goods locally for emergency use, which has stimulated the price of paper to rise. The price is now close to 200,000 yuan per ream. General publishers are struggling to maintain their business and plan to appeal to the Ministry of Education for relief and to solve the paper shortage problem quickly with effective measures to avoid an unprecedented serious book famine.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Teachers' College Student Riot Case Involves Inhuman Education</h3>
<p>The classroom of the Municipal Wuben Girls' High School was destroyed by students from the Municipal Teachers' College one evening, causing the school to be forced to suspend classes from the 2nd. This matter has aroused considerable social attention. According to an editorial in a certain newspaper, the principal of the Municipal Teachers' College should be replaced to rectify the academic atmosphere. It is said that the principal of the Municipal Teachers' College is Dong Renjian. Dong usually runs the Municipal Teachers' College in a way that does not follow the regulations of the Ministry of Education, but implements his own "Inhuman Education." The so-called "Inhuman Education" is to allow students to be free and not require teachers to teach, allowing students to engage in free activities. Those who have visited the Municipal Teachers' College have often criticized this approach. The incident of students from the Municipal Teachers' College rioting in a mob is said to be the result of the lack of discipline in "Inhuman Education."</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Charity Tennis Match: Cai Huiquan Suffers Defeat</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Hong Kong] A charity tennis exhibition match for British flood relief, featuring our country's former Davis Cup player Cai Huiquan against Ye Guanxiong, the newly crowned Hong Kong singles champion, was held on the 28th at this court. The court was wet from rain, not completely dry, and the sky was overcast with poor lighting. This was not ideal for the veteran player. Cai Huiquan's performance was not up to par.</p>
<p>In the first set, after a hard-fought battle, Ye won 6-4. When the score reached 5-5 in the second set, the referee, seeing the dimming sky, announced that three more games would be played. Whoever won two games would win the set. After the score became 6-6, Ye Guanxiong won another game, thus defeating Cai Huiquan in straight sets.</p>
<p>In the doubles match, Cai Guanxiong and Cai Huiquan faced the Xu brothers, Wei Pei and Run Pei. When they took the court, there was a light drizzle, and many spectators were disappointed. Before the first set was decided, the heavy rain came, and everyone dispersed in disappointment.</p>

<p>Xie Jinhong, Diya, Anderson, Chen Li, Se He, Yitu, Ganna Shi, Xiao Weilu, Zou Wenzhi, Xie Jinhe.</p>
<p>Basketball: The Vietnamese basketball team originally scheduled five matches in Hong Kong. After the second match against Zhongqing, due to various misunderstandings, the remaining matches against Zili, Black Cat, and Nanlai were temporarily canceled. Later, the leader of the Vietnamese team, Lin Luying, stated that the purpose of this trip was for exchange and sightseeing, and he stepped forward to mediate. The competition was then allowed to continue, and it was decided to first continue the match against Zili. The matches against Black Cat and South China will be rescheduled when the Vietnamese team returns to Hong Kong after completing their tour in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Zili was originally a strong team in Hong Kong, but due to personnel issues, their performance has been declining. The forward, Lu Zhenxuan, was missing, and only Zhang Shutang was active, making it difficult to score. Although the defender, Lu Dezhang, performed well, it was difficult to reverse the situation. After halftime, the substitute was brought in, shaking up the formation. As a result, the Vietnamese team took advantage and won 40-30. The Vietnamese team's record in Hong Kong is now two wins and one loss.</p>

<h3>National Banks and Bureaus to Adjust Exchange Rates in Various Places Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Remittance Amount Expected to be Relaxed, Review Procedures Tightened</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The exchange rates of remittances to various places from the city's four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury will be adjusted on a large scale starting May 5th. It is reported that this is due to the recent smuggling of large quantities of legal tender from Guangzhou to Hong Kong to obtain Hong Kong dollars and purchase foreign goods. On the other hand, some commercial firms are taking advantage of the low exchange rates of national banks and bureaus to engage in arbitrage. It is heard that the exchange rates of various commercial firms to various places are 190 yuan per 1,000 yuan to Xiamen and Quanzhou, 60 yuan to Fuzhou, 230 yuan for cash and 175 yuan for account transfer to Guangzhou. 180 yuan to 200 yuan to Shantou. 95 yuan to Hankou. 25 yuan to Chongqing. Related parties told reporters: Recently, the black market exchange rate has skyrocketed, and the difference with the official price has become increasingly large. The situation of overseas remittances escaping has also become increasingly serious, invisibly increasing the demand for huge amounts of legal tender. It is hoped that the government will seek practical solutions to the issue of overseas remittances. The purpose of the national banks and bureaus adjusting exchange rates in various places this time is to curb arbitrage by commercial firms. The current countermeasure is to tighten the review procedures, but the remittance amount will be relaxed. If commercial firms can state reasons and list facts, permission for allocation will be granted. The adjusted exchange rates for remittances to various places are listed as follows:</p>
<p>80 yuan per 1,000 yuan to Xiamen (originally 45 yuan), 60 yuan to Fuzhou (originally 40 yuan), 80 yuan to other places in the Fujian region (originally 45 yuan). 95 yuan to Guangzhou (originally 75 yuan), 95 yuan to Shantou (originally 80 yuan), 95 yuan to other places in the Guangdong region (originally 80 yuan). 2 yuan to Qingdao (originally 5 yuan), 5 yuan to other places in the Shandong region (originally 10 yuan).

<p>Request to Restore Free Trade of White Rice</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The rice problem is still extremely serious. In addition to selling rice allocated by the government, most rice shops have no goods to offer on the market. The black market prices are rumored to be varied and extremely chaotic. Citizens have nowhere to buy rice and feel quite panicked. Rice merchants find it difficult to transport rice, and petty thieves take the opportunity to extort money along the way, and there is a possibility of being robbed, so most dare not transport rice, and complaints are endless. They would rather not do business. A total of 9,040 bags arrived at the two markets yesterday, and Baiyuan was sold for 265,000 yuan. The Social Bureau still released 9,000 bags of white rice.</p>
<p>Mayor Reschedules Talk for Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu convened a meeting with representatives of rice merchants. At that time, the person in charge of the rice industry was surrounded by rice merchants in the market and could not get away. Only Hu Xiangang went, and the talk failed to materialize. Mayor Wu then rescheduled the talk to 8:30 AM on the 5th. The rice merchants gathered at the market decided to send Qu Zhenhua and others to visit the mayor at the City Hall and made two requests: (1) The rice sold by the city government should be sold at locations separately designated by the district offices in each district. (2) Restore free trade of white rice. When the representatives rushed to the City Hall, the mayor had already gone out on official business. They then went to the Social Bureau and agreed with the head of the Food Department, Ji Mingzhai, to visit Mayor Wu again at 8:30 AM on the 5th (Monday).</p>
<p>Fear of Performing Shop Raids, Afraid to Sell Allocated Rice</p>
<p>According to the representatives of the rice industry: the rice shops saw the great upsurge of rice shop raids in Hangzhou and became panicked. To avoid danger, they requested that the rice allocated by the city government be sold at locations separately designated by the district offices in each district, and the rice shops are willing to send personnel to assist voluntarily. As for the request to restore free trade, in view of the current price limit policy of the authorities, the rice shops are unwilling to sell when they have rice, and then relax one step after selling out. This depletes the source, and the capital of the rice merchants is gradually dwindling. People have no rice to buy, which creates a panic. Therefore, they requested that free trade be allowed to be restored as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Coarse Grains and Food Huai Hovering Situation</p>
<p>Flour was firm yesterday, bran was easier to move and turned smooth, rising by 2,000 yuan, sometimes up and sometimes down.</p>
<p>Soybean cake trading was hot again, tired and revived, rising by 2000 to 3000 yuan, also showing a sudden rise and sudden drop. The oil market shops turned prosperous, rebounding by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, also rising and falling rapidly. It is heard that Qingdao will also be opened, and oil distribution is being processed, with a hovering trend.</p>
<p>Soybeans were rare in both directions, with no glory or humiliation. Mung beans in Nanyang were moving but not prosperous, flat and less spiritual. Red beans in South China were digesting leisure, and the price stood still. Raw kernels were lively to remove and vigorous, advancing 10,000 yuan. Sesame seeds in Guangzhou were sluggish and dropped by more than 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was as before, and corn was traded little, with the market temporarily flat.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Loosen</h3>
<p>The sugar market yesterday approached the date of the allocation of Taiwan sugar, but the prices were undecided, so although the trend was soft, it did not fall too much. Such as Peruvian fine sand for 420,000 yuan, small 8,000 yuan, 24 coarse white small 10,000 yuan, 20 medium sand small 120,000 yuan, four and a half car white small more than 30,000 yuan, three and a half Xuan white fell similarly. Local sugar was slightly loose, Shantou Qing 270,000 yuan, small 5,000 yuan. Huangjiang Qing 265,000 yuan, Zhang Diao Qing 260,000 to 257,000 yuan, small 3000 to 5000 yuan. Xinghua White forty, 15,000 yuan, small 15,000 yuan. The second is 400,000 yuan to 395,000 yuan, Xinghua Red 300,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan, small more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Visits President Zhang</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Mayor Wu visited President Zhang of the Central Bank at around 5:00 PM yesterday. Soon after, Xu Kan, the Director-General of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, also arrived, and they jointly held talks for two hours. It is heard that the content of the talks was related to the suppression of high prices in the city.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Remains Dim</h3>
<p>The red and green teas exclusively for domestic sales saw little change yesterday in this district and those brought by merchants from other provinces. In terms of prices, there were minimal fluctuations within the fluctuating ranges. In the foreign-firm tea market, although several exporting firms were negotiating with cargo owners for certain export varieties, the bids from both parties were difficult to reconcile, leading to continued dim trading and a lifeless market.</p>
<p>Another report: Sui'an in Zhejiang Province is also a bountiful tea-producing area, with considerable annual sales both domestically and internationally. According to industry insiders, the local raw tea market has now opened, with prices reported at 250,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight).</p>
<h3>Industrial Oils Surge</h3>
<p>Due to dwindling stockpiles, industrial oils are being aggressively sought by soap factories, leading to further price increases. Wo-ben asphalt is quoted at 6.6 million yuan, and tallow at 8 million yuan, with some transactions occurring. Coconut oil is at 1.1 million yuan, with transactions, but in very small quantities, as oil merchants have already sold out.</p>
<h3>Western Medicine Prices Soar - Two Reasons Behind It</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to sources in the new medicine industry, the recent surge in Western medicine prices is due to two reasons: (1) The black market exchange rate is soaring, leading to merchants rushing to purchase, which further drives up prices. (2) The Import Control Committee announced a second-quarter quota of only US$600,000 for Western medicines. Furthermore, the eligibility criteria for importers are limited to those who imported Western medicines worth US$100,000 or more in the past year. For those with management rights, the import amount needs to be over US$50,000. Most of those meeting these qualifications are import/export companies. Legitimate pharmacies mostly ordered directly from major American pharmaceutical companies last year, but due to low production, the supply from these companies was limited, resulting in fewer imports by legitimate pharmacies. If the import quota for Western medicines is entirely in the hands of import/export companies, there is a deep concern that it will lead to monopolistic speculation and a shortage of goods on the market. Therefore, at the New Medicine Industry Association's general meeting on the 25th of last month, two requests were made to the Import Control Committee: (1) Revise the qualification review regulations for importing Western medicines so that professional and legitimate pharmacies are also listed as qualified Western medicine importing firms. (2) Western medicines that cannot be manufactured domestically or are produced in very small quantities should not be subject to quota systems. For other important medicines, quotas should be relaxed, which would make it easier to stabilize Western medicine prices.</p>
<h3>The Stock Market's Fragile Sentiment - Trends Unpredictable and Unstable</h3>
<p>Although the Chinese stock market appeared stable yesterday, its fragile sentiment led to repeated rises and falls, creating a sense of uncertainty. The central forces controlling the market were external, leaving retail investors at a loss and making the trend even more unpredictable.</p>
<p>In the morning, Qin and other Gu-Gu stocks, as well as Rong Chen and others, opened lower. When Di Yong Yarn entered the market and showed strength, all the Di Jiao stocks opened higher. After the opening, stocks like 94, 253, 207, 185, 186, 218, 22, 219, and 152 all advanced. Shang Wu first reached its limit, rising to 6,200 yuan. 102, 89, 335, and 142 were selling, and 106 and 219 sold after advancing, causing the price to fall back to around 6,050 yuan. 102, 105, 77, 4, 91, 105, 94, 153, and 89 came to purchase, and Jiu Fu also nearly reached its limit, rising to 6,230 yuan. 152, 145, 23, 177, and 183 were selling, and retail investors suddenly panicked. Rong Feng hit its limit and fell back to a low price of 6,030 yuan. In addition to 178, 2, 14, and 23 advancing to 6,200 yuan, 151 also came to buy in, raising Di Yong Yarn to a high price of 6,300 yuan. 105, 185, 154, 76, and 7 still had supply, and it fell back to around 6,100 yuan. 145, 148, 4, 152, and 129 came to buy, and Mei Ya was raised by 112 to its limit and remained stable. At midday, it hovered around 6,200 yuan. After the close, 223 sold off, pushing it down to below 6,100 yuan. It was rumored that there was news of loans in the evening papers. In the end, compared to the previous close, Di Yong Yarn was unchanged, Xin He and Mei Ya Hua Feng rose by half a percent, Xin Guang Zhong Fa fell by slightly less than half a percent, Jing Fu rose slightly, Yong Gong and Qin Xing fell slightly, and Xin Hua fell by slightly less than 10%. Di Jiao, Yong Yarn, Hua Feng, and Jing Fu each rose by about half a percent, Qin Xing fell by half a percent, Yong Gong fell slightly, Xin He and Xin Guang rose slightly, and Mei Ya reached its limit. Among the unpopular stocks, Shang Wu and Jiu Fu reached their limits. Matches reached their limit and then retreated, rising by half a percent. Rong Feng hit its limit and then recovered, falling by slightly more than half a percent. Zhong Fang Tong Yi was unchanged, Da Tong rose by slightly more than 10%, Cement fell by slightly less than 10%, and the gains and losses of the remaining stocks were minimal. The rise of the off-market stocks remained strong, rising between 10% and 10%. The rise of Zhong Hua was the strongest.</p>
<h3>Daylily Scarce, Prices Surge</h3>
<p>Recently, the stock of daylilies has been gradually decreasing, and production prices are tightening. Zhenjiang has risen from 470,000-80,000 yuan to 640,000 yuan. High-priced cargo in the market is sold at 750,000 yuan, with subsequent reductions, and the market appears stable.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Industry Representatives Request the National Bank to Allocate Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Or Not to Impose Rigid Regulations on Purchase and Sale Prices</p>
<p>[Our Report] Representatives of the local jewelry industry, Wu Pengnian, Yao Guiqing, Qiu Yungen, and Feng Qing'an, visited President Zhang of the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at around 4 pm and were received by Vice President Liu on his behalf. The representatives presented two points: (1) They hope the National Bank can allocate raw materials such as gold bars and gold blocks. (2) If allocation is not possible, then rigid regulations should not be imposed on the prices at which the jewelry industry purchases and sells. Mr. Liu indicated that he would relay the message to President Zhang. However, he stated that the National Bank could not make a decision on this matter and would need to consult the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>According to industry insiders, the jewelry industry's past sales of gold jewelry helped regulate rural finance, as farmers often used their income to purchase gold jewelry. Now, due to the inability to purchase gold jewelry, they are flocking to buy daily necessities, which is also contributing to the price increases of daily necessities. Furthermore, the industry has decided to send letters to jewelry industries in Beijing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiujiang, Changsha, Chongqing, and other places in the near future to dispatch representatives to Shanghai to convene a national jewelry industry representatives conference to determine the industry's future direction. It is rumored that they will collectively petition the central government.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>The coal market this week has been relatively calm. There is not much supply of high-quality white coal, making the market relatively brisk. Lower-quality coal is not suitable for local sales in Shanghai, making its market sluggish. Although coal producers have been approved to purchase their own bituminous coal, the limited coal supply and the current sluggish factory sales in Shanghai mean that industry insiders still seem to have little interest, and prices have not changed much. Coke shipments from Jiangxi and Hubei are still arriving, and Shanghai's demand is also strong. The market is stable, with Pingxiang coke prices holding steady between 950,000 and 1,000,000 yuan. Firewood prices have risen slightly due to the impact of rising rice prices on production area prices.</p>
<h3>Soap Market Scarce, Factories Holding Back</h3>
<p>The soap market is extremely scarce. Due to soaring soap prices in other ports, there is a rush to purchase in Shanghai. Soap factories believe that the current market prices are not sufficient to cover production costs, so they are releasing very little supply. Furthermore, the source of raw materials is limited and the inventory is low. Recently, the prices of oils, caustic soda, and pure alkali have surged by more than 150%, while soap prices have not yet doubled. If customers continue to purchase in large quantities, soap prices will rise sharply again.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank Convenes Meeting to Promote This Year's Cocoon Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Agricultural Bank of China recently convened a meeting of responsible persons from its branches in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Hangzhou, and other places, as well as representatives from various cocoon firms, to discuss promoting this year's spring cocoon loans. It was decided that: (1) The Sericulture Production and Marketing Coordination Committee will be requested to report the approved loan amounts for each cocoon firm. After being approved by the Four Banks Joint Office, the loans will be issued. (2) The silkworm cocoons in eastern Zhejiang are on the market earlier. To avoid congestion, the Hangzhou branch of the China Sericulture Company will first borrow 2 billion yuan from the Hangzhou Agricultural Bank of China to loan to various firms. The loan will be guaranteed by the Zhejiang Construction Department and will be deducted from the total amount of spring cocoon loans in the future.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Transportation Issues</h3>
<p>The Export Promotion Committee is Working to Resolve Them</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held its ninth meeting at the Central Bank yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Chairman Zhang Jia'ao, Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu, Committee members Liu Gongyun, Jin Shixuan, and Shen Xirui, and advisors Li Rui, Bai Yien, and Mag attended. Several important cases were resolved. It was reported that due to the lack of tonnage in ships and the lack of storage facilities in Wuhan and other places, the Committee is working hard to resolve the issue of transporting tung oil from Chongqing to Shanghai. In addition to sending a letter to the Chongqing Shipping Allocation Committee to find a solution, the Tung Oil Working Group is also conducting research. Furthermore, the smuggling of tung oil to Hong Kong is becoming increasingly serious, resulting in significant losses of foreign exchange. It was reported that the Committee has already discussed countermeasures and is submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Another report: The China Vegetable Oil Factory exported 1,700 tons of tung oil last month and sold 640 tons. From January to March, the exported portion was 3,000 tons, and the sold portion was 3,050 tons. The company's exports in Hong Kong from January to March were 7,000 tons, while other firms' exports in Hong Kong were 7,600 tons. Furthermore, it is known that there are more than a dozen other firms in Shanghai engaged in tung oil exports, such as the China Trust Bureau, Shen Yuan Lai Nanyang Company, and Yi Rui, whose export volume from January to March was 3,500 tons. Tung oil is a major export commodity for our country and occupies an important position in international trade. In recent months, the export volume has not been high. According to industry insiders, the reasons are: (1) High production area prices and transportation difficulties, with Shanghai prices at 450,000 yuan per shi dan (unit of weight), or approximately US$0.37 per pound. (2) Overseas price declines, with a price of US$0.27 per pound, resulting in losses. (3) Abundant overseas inventory. In the United States alone, the estimated total amount is sufficient for ten months of use. Furthermore, the instability of our country's currency has caused foreign merchants to be apprehensive, and producers are hoarding goods, leading to this unfavorable situation.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Prices Chaotic</h3>
<p>Since January, the market price of caustic soda has soared from 3.5 million yuan to around 8 million yuan. Due to the recent surge in black market exchange rates and reported price increases abroad, yarn factories and soap factories are scrambling to purchase. Raw material merchants do not have much inventory, and retail investors are not only unwilling to sell but are also trying their best to buy, resulting in a lack of transactions and chaotic bidding. The number of trading chips in the market is quite depleted.</p>
<h3>Improving Xuchang Tobacco Leaves - Nine Out of Ten Businesses Were Banned</h3>
<p>The Xuchang tobacco leaf improvement project has achieved significant results after being jointly promoted by the Xuchang Tobacco Leaf Improvement Field of the Tobacco Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, led by Field Director Chen, and various local authorities. Eight or nine out of ten inferior leaves have been banned. Furthermore, 34 businesses, including Cheng Defeng and others, have been banned from selling miscellaneous tobacco, totaling 9,860 pounds. Fines of 11,190,000 yuan were imposed in accordance with regulations. The funds were directly deposited by the tobacco firms into the county bank in a special account. Two organizational regulations have been drafted, including the organizational regulations of the Miscellaneous Tobacco Prohibition Committee and the service rules for inspection personnel. In the future, it is planned to establish five to seven prohibition offices in major tobacco-producing counties such as Xuchang, Xiangcheng, Yuxian, Jiaxian, Changge, Linying, and Yexian, depending on the actual circumstances. They will be established as soon as the Kunshan Shou Cuo and personnel arrangements are completed.</p>
<h3>Fresh Meat Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>Due to continuous rainy days, the supply of pigs has decreased, and production areas are frequently raising prices. The disassembled price of fresh meat in the city yesterday rose to 550,000 yuan per 100 jin, the highest new price this year. Separately, the retail price of leg and rib meat is 7,000 yuan, and the price of strip ribs is 6,000 yuan. Another report: The prices of green vegetables, bamboo shoots, and other items have doubled compared to half a month ago.</p>
<h3>Wing Tai Wo Adjusts Allocation Prices</h3>
<p>Since the authorities banned gold and banknote trading, most of the local money exchange houses have switched to the cigarette industry. They hold large amounts of capital and drag and roll cigarettes toward the market and simply regard stocks and other commodity prices as an indicator, and disregard actual sales, which in turn promoted the cigarette prices to rise, rising without limit. Now it is understood that Wing Tai Wo Tobacco Company, in order to mitigate the rising prices of the marriage market, is planning to distribute a large number of products, but the allocation price will be slightly adjusted, with Great Britain at 400 boxes per box. Huang Zhuang Xiong, (increased by 800,000 yuan), Old Knife per box is 3.2 million yuan, (increased by 600,000 yuan) but is still cheaper than the market price.</p>
<h3>New Tea from Taiwan Enters the Market</h3>
<p>Taipei, 3rd. This province's new tea has been on the market successively since before and after Qingming, and the tea houses in the provincial capital are showing vitality, but the transportation to other provinces is still rare. The price of new tea leaves is slightly softer than last year, at about 10,000 yuan per 100 catties. In addition, old tea inventories are gradually decreasing, showing a state of having market but no sales.</p>
<h3>Printing Prices Increase - 33% Added to the Old Price</h3>
<p>The local printing industry association officially decided to adjust printing prices from the 3rd, with all calculations based on a 33% increase over the old prices. The typesetting cost for book editions was previously 18,000 yuan per thousand characters, but is now 23,940 yuan. The printing cost for book editions was previously 38,000 yuan per thousand copies, but is now 50,540 yuan. For each additional thousand copies, the previous cost was 32,000 yuan, but is now 42,560 yuan.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Guangdong Xicun Cement Factory - The Only Cement Supplier in South China</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Liang Feng</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 18th (Air Dispatch)</p>
<p>Recently, with the introduction of a friend, I visited the Guangdong Xicun Cement Factory (Saichuen Cement Works), which is the only factory in South China that manufactures cement products. Because this also belongs to heavy industry, the machinery for manufacturing cement must be transported and assembled from abroad, so there are not many cement factories in our country at all. I remember that during the war in the Great Rear Area, there was only one Sichuan Cement Factory in Chongqing, and the scale was not large, with a daily output of only 900 barrels. After the restoration, although large-scale cement factories in North and Central China have gradually resumed work, in South China, there is still only one factory to this day, which is the Guangdong Xicun Cement Factory. The cement needed by several provinces, including Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi, all relies on its supply. Xicun is a place in the western suburbs of Guangzhou. The trees there are shady and the scenery is quite beautiful. Before the war, the Guangdong Construction Department designated that area as the first industrial zone in Guangdong, and there was a provincial industrial vocational school there. However, after several years of occupation, many of our constructions were destroyed beyond recognition by the enemy and puppet forces. Although the archway with the words "Guangdong First Industrial Zone" still stands majestically, the inside is desolate. The only decorations in this industrial zone are a beverage factory, an industrial test institute of the Construction Department, and the cement factory, among which the cement factory is the only one with a larger scale!</p>
<p>Historical Vicissitudes</p>
<p>This cement factory has always been a provincially run factory. It began preparations in August of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, and the engineer responsible for the opening and construction was Deng Hongyi. All the machinery was ordered from the Danish F.L.midth factory. It took a total of 30 months to complete the installation of the machinery and the construction of the factory, and it was officially established in March of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China. The more important machinery in the factory includes a stone crusher, a mud washing pond, a raw material mill, a clinker mill, and several parts such as a clinker kiln. They are all huge machines. The clinker kiln is magnificent. It is a large iron pipe with a diameter of more than ten feet and a length of more than 230 feet. There are three of these kilns in total. Under the operation of these machines, 3,600 barrels of cement (340 catties per barrel) can be produced every day. However, precisely because these machines were too large and bulky, they could not be dismantled and evacuated during the fall of Guangzhou, and it was too late to destroy them. As a result, they were used by the Japanese Asano Corporation to continue producing cement and supply it to the Japanese army in the occupied areas of various provinces in South China to build fortifications. This is truly an incalculable loss for us!</p>
<p>Restoration Process</p>
<p>After the restoration, the factory was taken over by the Construction Department, and Mr. Sun Man, the original director of the factory before the war, was appointed as the general manager to be responsible for the preparation of the restoration work. However, when the Japanese army surrendered, the factory was severely damaged. All the slurry ponds, stone crushers, a 2,000 kW generator, and a 4,000 kW generator were blown up. Two of the original three clinker kilns were dismantled. It has now been found that one was moved to Hainan Island, and the other was moved to Northeast China. Therefore, after more than half a year, the damaged and missing parts were slowly repaired and supplemented, and it finally resumed operation in mid-June of last year! There are now more than 400 technicians and staff in the factory, in addition to 200-300 workers who mine stone and transport it from their mines. However, because there is only one kiln now, and it is also subject to restrictions on the supply of coal and electricity, the current output is only one-third of what it was before the war, which is 1,200 barrels of cement per day.</p>
<p>A Glimpse Inside</p>
<p>After we visited the various manufacturing departments of the factory, we learned that the manufacture of cement is not very difficult and the procedures are not complicated. The most difficult thing is probably the equipment of those magnificent machines! The main raw materials for making cement are the stones (gypsum stone), mud (mountain mud and sea mud), gypsum, and water that we see every day. The manufacturing process is roughly as follows: first, crush the crushed stone in a stone crusher, and on the other hand, wash the mud in a mud washing pond to make it pure mud. Then mix the crushed stone, slurry, and water and put them into a raw material mill to grind them, which becomes stone slurry. Then put the stone slurry into the long kiln and use high heat to burn it, which becomes clinker. Add a certain amount of gypsum to this clinker, then put it into a clinker mill to grind it finely, and then weigh it, add a package, and that's the finished product!</p>
<p>Comparable to British Cement</p>
<p>In the past, most of the cement we used was supplied by imports, and "British Cement" was even more famous. However, according to Manager Sun of the factory, because they are willing to study carefully and make it meticulously, the Five Rams brand cement produced by the factory is not only the finest and most exquisite cement in the country, but is also superior in its exquisite manufacturing compared with imported products. At the same time, their pricing is also the most reasonable. According to their current wholesale price, it is 18,000 yuan per small package (85 catties), and it is handled by 21 distributors, who are required to have a profit of no more than 20%. The market price of imported products is at least 8 Hong Kong dollars per small package, which is not as cheap as ours. So their products are not only beautiful but also the cheapest!</p>
<p>In the current stage of construction first, cement is really the most important material for all water conservancy projects, bridges, and even the construction of houses. Therefore, it can also be regarded as a national defense industry. After we visited the Xicun Cement Factory, we felt that their contribution to the country and society is really significant. In particular, their spirit of careful research and hard work to increase production is even more admirable.</p>
<h3>Report on the Moscow Conference: Full Text of Mr. Marshall's Speech (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Question of the German-Polish Border Forms a Major Dispute</p>
<p>Border Issues—The German border issue is a major point of contention, and it is another example of attendees quickly disagreeing over the Three-Power Declaration regarding German borders. People fleeing west of the Oder River were already present, and there were already traces of Soviet presence. At that time, Truman acknowledged this situation. Generally speaking, acknowledging the situation, the Three-Power Declaration stated: "The Three Powers hereby express their opinion: The final delimitation of the western frontier of Poland should await the peace settlement."</p>
<p>Now, Molotov states that the Potsdam Conference had already reached a final agreement on the German-Polish border issue, and that the above paragraph only refers to awaiting the peace settlement to finalize the border. Therefore, he believes that the only matters that should be considered now are the technical issues of demarcating the border.</p>
<p>The U.S. government recognizes its obligations under the Yalta Agreement to compensate Poland fairly in the west for its incorporation of territories east of the Curzon Line into the Soviet Union. If this temporary arrangement between Germany and Poland were to become permanent, Germany would lose a portion of its territory that, before the war, provided over one-fifth of the food supply for the German people. Obviously, Germany, within very limited boundaries, must not only support as many people as before the war but also provide for a large number of Germans from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>This situation is unavoidable, but we must not allow it to become more serious. We do not want Poland to reduce its pre-war resources. Poland should have more resources, but giving Poland these borders will not benefit Poland. Because these borders may cause various problems in the future, borders, no matter where they are drawn, should not be barriers to trade and commerce. The happiness of Europe depends entirely on this trade and commerce. We must look forward to a future where a democratic Poland and a democratic Germany become good neighbors.</p>
<p>Opinions Differ Greatly on Drafting Peace Treaty with Germany</p>
<p>Peace Treaty Procedures—Opinions vary greatly on how the Allied countries that fought against Germany should participate in the drafting and ratification of the peace treaty with Germany. There are fifty-one countries related to this matter. Among them, in addition to the four major Allied powers, there are adult countries directly engaged in combat. Of course, the scope of combat varies in size and degree.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's position is that all Allied countries that fought against Germany should have the opportunity to participate in the drafting and conclusion of the peace treaty. However, we acknowledge that it would be difficult, though not impossible, for all fifty-one countries to participate in drafting a treaty. Therefore, the U.S. government is trying to encourage all parties to agree on a method that includes two different procedures, depending on whether the country in question actually participated in the fighting. However, all countries will have the opportunity to express their opinions and refute others' opinions, and all countries will attend a peace conference to pass a treaty.</p>
<p>Countries that have suffered from German occupation and terror and have suffered significant losses in arduous combat are reluctant to accept countries that have not suffered losses in manpower and material resources and are far from the war to participate in deciding the terms of the peace treaty. But the United States believes that all countries that fought against Germany should have a voice in resolving the German issue.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Delays on the Four-Power Pact</p>
<p>Four-Power Pact—The proposal for a Four-Power Pact was put forward by the U.S. government a year ago. We hoped that this simple pact would be quickly accepted by all parties, guaranteeing that the United States intended to cooperate closely with other countries to prevent German rearmament before concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the German issue. The conclusion of this pact will eliminate fears of the future and facilitate a peace that meets the current and future needs of Europe, making it easier to succeed. At the same time, we also hoped that the U.S. signing this pact would alleviate the fear among European powers that the United States would repeat the steps taken after World War I. At that time, the United States first insisted on some clauses of the peace treaty and then suddenly withdrew, pushing the responsibility for implementing the treaty away completely. We believe that the Four Powers concluding a pact guaranteeing the continued disarmament of Germany would once again show the world that we have the full sincerity to seek peace and security in Europe.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet government proposed a series of amendments to our proposal. These amendments would be sufficient to change the nature of the entire pact, making it a complex treaty in practice. Moreover, the Soviet side included in the amendments many key points on German issues that are fundamentally difficult to agree upon. Therefore, I have to draw a conclusion: either the Soviet government is unwilling to realize this pact, or it is trying to delay it so that it will not be adopted for the time being. Whether a final agreement on this issue can be reached remains to be seen. But I believe that the United States will definitely adhere to its current position, insist on simplifying the pact, and limit it to a fundamental purpose—that is, to prevent Germany from launching another war.</p>
<p>Opinions Differ Greatly on Key Points of the Austrian Treaty</p>
<p>The Austrian Treaty Issue—Negotiations on the Austrian Treaty resulted in agreement on most issues, but several points remain unresolved, all of which are extremely important. The Soviet Union expressed its approval for paying reparations and ceding Carinthia to Yugoslavia, but the other participating countries expressed their opposition.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the issue of German assets in Austria. According to the Potsdam Agreement, German assets in Austria should belong to the Soviet Union. The Soviet side believes that all German assets in Austria (the other three powers believe these are assets of Austrians and Allied expatriates forcibly seized after the German army entered Austria in March 1938) should be regarded as German assets in Austria. The Soviet side refused to consider the term "forcibly seized," while the other three powers believed that the term "forcibly seized" was an important criterion for determining what exactly constituted German assets.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union also refused to consider any compromise solutions to resolve this dispute. All efforts to seek a compromise solution were unsuccessful. In my opinion, the United States cannot recognize this clearly unfair treaty, and this treaty will create a weak and helpless Austria, which will be a source of major danger in the future. At the last meeting of the conference, everyone agreed to appoint a committee to meet in Vienna on May 12 to reconsider our objections and to establish an expert panel to investigate German assets in Austria. If we want to fulfill our obligations, recognize Austria as a free and independent state, and lift the occupation zone's food rations, then we should of course take prompt action on the Austrian Treaty.</p>
<p>Summary—Although these issues are very complex, there is still a pattern to be found regarding the characteristics and control of Central Europe. The foreign ministers agreed that their task was to lay the foundation for a German central government, promote German economic unification, establish feasible borders, and establish guaranteed control through a Four-Power Pact. Austria should quickly resolve the occupation zone's food rations and be treated as a liberated and independent country.</p>
<p>No Agreement Could Be Reached at the Moscow Conference</p>
<p>It was impossible for the Moscow Conference to reach a consensus because, in our view, the Soviet Union was insisting on various proposals that would establish a central government in Germany in order to seize absolute control over this economically collapsing country. This government is destined to collapse economically because it has a small area, a large population, and will use most of its production to pay for reparations, mainly to the Soviet Union. The Soviet delegation demanded the same compensation from Austria, but in a different way.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. delegation, such a plan not only involves indefinite subsidies from the United States but also will only lead to the worsening of German and European economic life, which will inevitably lead to dictatorship and strife.</p>
<p>The freedom of reporting represented by our government must include all appeals to public opinion. But in Moscow, appealing to emotions and prejudices through propaganda seemed to replace appealing to reason and understanding. The Soviet delegation's criticisms and interpretations of the Potsdam Agreement and other agreements were completely different from the facts as understood by the U.S. delegation.</p>
<p>The true intentions and motives of various proposals or objections to such proposals cannot, of course, be determined. This is inevitable in any international negotiation.</p>
<p>But regardless of how divergent the above opinions are, and how difficult the problems are, the progress we have made toward the final solution of the problems may be greater than expected.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the differences between the parties have been fully revealed. From now on, the problems can be seen clearly, and future discussions will know how to start resolving the outstanding issues. The foreign ministers of each country have clearly understood the accurate views of their respective governments on different issues. Then, they may be able to resolve some differences, or submit a report on the results of the agreement and non-agreement, so that the outstanding issues can be further clarified. This is the greatest hope for the next few months. No matter how difficult and slow progress is, there will inevitably be some progress in the end. These things are of great importance to the lives of all European people and to the future of world history. We should not compromise on major principles in order to reach an agreement. Similarly, we must sincerely seek to understand different opinions.</p>
<p>At this point, I am reminded of a statement Marshal Stalin made to me. When he spoke about this meeting, he believed that these were just preliminary probes and contacts with the problem. In the past, we had many problems and many different opinions, but it seemed to have become a rule that people understood the need for coordination after being tired of debating. We may not have had much success at this meeting, but he believed that it was still possible to reach agreements on all major issues. These issues include the disarmament of Germany, the problem of Germany's political organization, the problem of reparations, and the problem of economic unification. We must be patient and not be pessimistic.</p>
<p>The Situation in Europe is Serious, the Soviet Union Should Not Delay</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the views expressed by Stalin are correct, and I hope that his opinions show that in future meetings, the Soviet delegation will have greater cooperation. However, we cannot ignore the time factor involved here. The recovery of Europe has been slower than I expected. The forces of division are becoming more obvious. The doctors are pondering deeply, but the patient is dying. Therefore, I believe that we should not delay again and again until the moment of no return before taking action. New problems arise every day. We should take steady and possible actions to deal with these urgent problems without hesitation.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my opinion on a certain aspect of something that has a major relationship with all of us. Just like the experience of Burns, I could not invite the two leading members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to attend the meeting with me, but I did get the extremely valuable assistance of Mr. Dulles, a Republican member of the House of Representatives and an expert on foreign affairs. In fact, during this conference, Senators Vandenberg and Connally clearly expressed the bipartisan nature of U.S. foreign affairs measures in the midst of leading the Senate in planning new developments in foreign policy. This sign of consensus was of great help to me far away in Moscow. I believe that today's world situation and the situation of the United States have made it the responsibility of the American people to take unified action. That is why I have reported in detail my views on the Foreign Ministers Conference. (End)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>— Dedicated to the Shanghai Literary and Art Workers Association - A New "May Fourth Movement"</p>
<p>— Xu Zhongdong</p>
<p>Fight for the dignity of mankind!</p>
<p>Fight for the reverence of wisdom!</p>
<p>Fight for the freedom of thought!</p>
<p>In the modern Chinese intellectual history, the "May Fourth Movement" is a page that should be specially highlighted. This movement was initially a patriotic movement, and later evolved from a patriotic movement into an intellectual liberation movement. The so-called liberation is to liberate from feudal ideas, overthrow old ethics, and absorb new ideas from abroad. In literature, the greatest achievement was the replacement of classical Chinese with vernacular Chinese, which ascended to the throne.</p>
<p>Analyzing the historical facts of the "May Fourth Movement," it first started with specific events and people; even if it later shifted from reality to thought, it was a "smooth evolution" rather than a new beginning. Then, we might as well say: it was passive. Secondly, the movement made great contributions to overthrowing the old ethics; unfortunately, this contribution only contained destructiveness and no constructiveness, so it was negative. Thirdly, it absorbed "new" ideas from abroad—which may have already been outdated in those countries—eating everything without discrimination. The result? Contradiction, superficiality, degeneration, indigestion! On this point, it failed completely.</p>
<p>Since then, every national humiliation has aroused a wave of patriotic sentiment. However, there are very few cases where patriotic sentiment has been expanded and deepened into a certain kind of thought. The most important one was after "August 13th"; the peak of that period coincided with the gathering of Chinese cultural figures in Wuhan; at that time, the nation was paramount, the prejudices of the individual were discarded, and efforts were made to build a new China in spirit. The momentum was so great and the waves so surging that it almost surpassed the "May Fourth Movement." Because the "May Fourth Movement" only contained destructiveness, while this one contained constructiveness; the "May Fourth Movement" was negative, while this one was positive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all climaxes are difficult to sustain, and this movement that almost surpassed the May Fourth Movement only went "almost," and did not become a reality! Since the "tragic victory," the Chinese cultural world has been on the verge of bankruptcy. This is not alarmist talk, but 100% true. We can find any professor, any writer, any scholar, any publisher, any journalist, any college student, any cultural person of any kind, and talk to him or them about the situation in the contemporary Chinese cultural world. Unless the other party is blind, deaf, an idiot, or mentally ill, he or they will never be optimistic!</p>
<p>Perhaps some people attribute the creation of this situation to the "tragic victory." This is not entirely wrong, but not entirely correct either. Another group of people believes that this is related to the "internal strife"; internal strife leads to unease, and unease leads to economic recession, which naturally includes the decline of culture. This view is also partially correct, but not entirely correct. Why? If we talk about "tragic victory," it is not just China alone; France "won" even more "tragically" than us. However, at the recent Moscow Conference, the Soviet Union was the host, and the United States and Britain were the main pillars, so their participation was natural; in addition, France, which had surrendered, participated, while China, which fought to the end, was excluded: why is this? Is it because China and France both had a tragic victory, and France has already embarked on the road to recovery, while our China is progressing too slowly and is still far from this goal, so we are looked down upon? Taking a step back—or rather, taking a step forward—the countries that "tragically failed," such as Germany and Japan, especially Japan, are of course living harder lives than us, but judging from their past cultural standards and the perseverance of their national character, their recovery does not seem to be too slow or too uncertain. Why is this again? If we talk about "internal strife," it seems that in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there was war every day, and the chaos was even worse than today, but how can the scholarship of that time compare with the scholarship of today? Why is this even more so?</p>
<p>Materialists say: all of this is because of material relations. If material civilization is not prosperous, it will inevitably lead to such a tragic result. When I heard the words "material civilization," I couldn't help but smile: because although matter can create a certain kind of civilization, the use of matter still depends on the brain. The difference between "spiritual civilization" and "material civilization" lies in: "spiritual civilization" takes people as the master and things as the slave; "material civilization" also takes people as the master when it first rises, but it takes people as the slave when it reaches its peak! Especially in culturally backward countries—"culture" includes both spirit and matter—when they encounter culturally advanced countries, they will inevitably become slaves. Contemporary China is the "second master" of the great powers, that is, a high-class slave; at most, it is just a parasite; as for equality, it is far away, beyond the ten thousand li! This is the reality, and we should no longer be blinded by the name of "Five Great Powers," deliberately not seeing, or daring not to see this fact!</p>
<p>The "Atlantic Charter" explains the new human rights and also explains the new dignity of mankind, which is in line with the dignity of the times. However, this charter reflects that the current world does not recognize these human rights and this dignity; otherwise, if it had already become a reality, why would we need this charter? In China, for a long time—long before the "May Fourth Movement"—all policies and all social activities have made the mistake of "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the foot when it hurts"; they focus on "events" based on "individuals," rather than focusing on "individuals" based on "events"; this practice of reversing the master and slave, and turning slaves into masters, completely abandons the human rights that should be enjoyed, and completely forgets the dignity of mankind! Wood must be eaten by insects before worms are born, and people must insult themselves before others insult them: if you despise yourself, why should others respect you?</p>
<p>In terms of vision, humans are inferior to cats; in terms of smell, humans are inferior to dogs; in terms of running, humans are inferior to horses; in terms of physical strength, humans are inferior to cattle. However, humans are the most intelligent of all things, and cats, dogs, horses, and cattle are used by them: why is this? Because humans have a high degree of intelligence and develop in many ways; while the intelligence of animals is either far inferior to humans, or develops only in one way, or only has imitative ability and no creativity. Man is only the most fragile reed in the universe: a breeze can blow it down, and a drop of rain can make it bow its head. A small sparrow, standing on a willow branch, sways with the wind and has nothing to do with it; however, if it takes a fancy to this reed, this reed cannot bear its weight, and if it is lucky enough not to break in the middle, it will inevitably prostrate on the ground! However... this is a reed with wisdom and the ability to think: it knows its own fragility, but it can think of various ways to first protect itself, and then try to overcome the universe that is many billions of times larger than itself: this is the fate of mankind, this is the ambition of mankind, and this is also the greatness of mankind! Therefore, the dignity of mankind lies in wisdom.</p>
<p>Of course, this small reed is very stubborn. It uses a spirit of dauntlessness to deal with and wrestle with wind, fire, water, earth, sun, moon, stars, and beasts. Its life is a constant struggle, and its happiness is the smile of victory. However, there is a considerable process from a seed becoming a reed; in this process, it needs sweet rain and gentle breezes—just as human thought needs freedom! It is said that there are scammers in the world who specialize in scamming children. After scamming them, they raise the children in jars. When they grow up, they turn into all kinds of monsters: the thoughts that are cultivated in an atmosphere of unfreedom are all strange thoughts. This reed, even if it grows up, is a morbid reed, an unhealthy reed.</p>
<p>If the "May Fourth Movement" was a liberation movement, liberating the Chinese people who were bound by the old ethics and restoring their freedom, especially restoring their freedom of thought, then we have to lament that the ripple of the movement was not broad and dried up halfway! Let's not talk about the distant past—because we don't have huge space or enough time to describe and criticize them one by one—let's talk about what's close at hand, that is, the short time since the "tragic victory." Is there freedom of thought? Of course, the nation is paramount, and all thoughts that endanger the nation should be eliminated: this is true in all countries in the world, not only in China. However, even within the scope of national policy, has there been cultivation of free thought, has there been allowing freedom of thought to develop, as permitted by the constitution and ordinary laws? I will lie awake at night seeking it, but I cannot find it, and can only toss and turn!</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that the government does not intend to suppress thought: first, all the officials in power are intellectuals, and even if they have risen to prominence and have high positions and generous salaries, they still retain some scholarly temperament; second, they have accumulated many years of experience and know that thought cannot be "suppressed," for if it is "suppressed," it will "change," and if it "changes," it will be "more harmful"! However, there is one thing they have to admit: in recent years, they have not paid attention to wisdom, and have not paid attention to scholarship! It is not that they have not taken measures similar to paying attention to scholarship and paying attention to wisdom, and even some of them are somewhat satisfactory. However, generally speaking, there are probably very few who seek impartiality and selflessness, and who truly deeply understand the reverence of wisdom and the preciousness of scholarship! In fact, there are not a few morning stars, it is just that the sunlight is a little strong, blinding the eyes—and the sunlight in this place at this time is golden!</p>
<p>Because of this one-thousandth of an inch difference, the entire Republic of China has become chaotic and backward. "When superiors and inferiors contend for profit, the country is in danger": is there a contention for profit between superiors and inferiors now? Let's not talk about it for now. Just this "comprador spirit" flooding like a flood is more than enough to destroy the country! What is the "comprador spirit"? The people of Shanghai all understand this; I'll add a few words for readers who are not from Shanghai: when they see foreigners, they forget their parents and grandparents, bowing deeply; when they see Chinese people, they look arrogant and haughty; when they see money, their hearts blossom and they are overjoyed. "The purpose of life is to make money," only the devil's son studies! Thus, thus, thus, that is the "comprador spirit." Today's old men, middle-aged men, young men, gentlemen, ladies, young ladies, and young masters are all "using their brains" and trying to make a fortune. Of course, life is pressing, but most of the time, it is "people" who are pressing "life," constantly improving life.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what other countries are like? First, let's talk about the United States and the Soviet Union. They are at opposite poles in terms of thought and policy, but they both respect wisdom. How was the atomic bomb invented in the United States? Because the United States was willing to spend money and invest capital, gather scholars from various countries, provide them with security of life, and provide them with the convenience of research: thus, the atomic bomb was invented in the United States first, not in other countries. Before World War II, the United States had a very developed applied science (because it had money), but theoretical science was not as good as Germany and France. Now, it has not only caught up, but also implicitly occupies a leading position! As for the Soviet Union, there was an initial mistake: the sanctity of labor suppressed brain work, and academic standards fell sharply, almost inferior to the imperial era. They discovered this mistake and immediately cleverly broadened the scope of "labor" to include both "hands" and "brains," so it encompassed everything. Today, in the Soviet Union, a brain worker is at least free from the danger of freezing and starvation.</p>
<p>France, a "victorious" country, is trying every means and using all its strength to promote scholarship and fight for the dignity of mankind. It is reported that France has discovered all the secrets of the atomic bomb: according to common sense, this news is unlikely to be false. Japan, a "tragically defeated" country, is bound to conduct academic research under the protection of the Americans, and some news has already been leaked and published in newspapers. Germany, a "tragically defeated" country, is in a more difficult situation than Japan—Japan is protected by one strong power, while Germany faces the danger of being divided by several strong powers—but to say that Germans do not conduct academic research is as unreliable as saying that Chinese people do not play mahjong!</p>
<p>While others are burying their heads in research, we are promoting the "comprador spirit." Perhaps atomic bombs can be resisted with mahjong, and radar rockets can be neutralized with customs gold. Human strength is inferior to cattle, human running is inferior to horses, and human smelling and seeing are not as good as dogs and cats: if humans lose their wisdom, if humans despise wisdom, then they are inferior to cattle, horses, dogs, and cats! Today is May 4th, and it is also the opening of the founding congress of the Shanghai Writers Association. With passion, I utter the following call; I think that all those who do not want to be half-men, do not want to be horses, do not want to be dogs, do not want to be cats, but want to be "human beings," will definitely express their sympathy to me and shout with me:</p>
<p>— We want:</p>
<p>To fight for the dignity of mankind!</p>
<p>To fight for the reverence of wisdom!</p>
<p>To fight for the freedom of thought!</p>

<h3>Li Zonghuang's Speech: Grassroots Organizations</h3>
<p>— Chen Qilong</p>
<p>Jiangning, 20th Dispatch</p>
<p>Today is the graduation ceremony for the fifth session of your county's cadre training center. I am very happy and excited to have this opportunity to participate! I have devoted my life's energy to working at the grassroots level because my parents were farmers, and I came from the fields. Remembering the source of the water I drink, I have always liked to be close to my farmer compatriots and comrades. So, of course, I had to come today.</p>
<p>Interpretation of Grassroots Organizations</p>
<p>What are grassroots organizations? In a broad sense, all levels of the county can be said to be grassroots organizations, and the so-called grassroots are relative to the province and the central government above the county. In a narrow sense, it refers only to rural townships, villages, and neighborhoods. The county level is the main body of local self-government, so all personnel engaged in county administration are also personnel engaged in local self-government. When it comes to the nature and meaning of grassroots organizations, of course, all political measures cannot be separated from the scope of "control, education, nurturing, and sanitation." Since the county is also the main body of local self-government, it naturally has the nature of a local self-governing body within its jurisdiction. According to the teachings of the Father of the Nation: "Local self-governing bodies are not only political organizations but also economic organizations." From this, we can see that this grassroots organization places special emphasis on people's livelihood issues, using political organizations as a means to achieve economic organizations as the goal. Economic organization is the center of gravity in grassroots organizations. The law on the implementation of local self-government has very detailed provisions, which I believe you all already have a full understanding of. The various agricultural, industrial, trade, banking, insurance, and other cooperatives to be established in the new county system all take rural townships as the center to implement production. If we do a good job in these political and economic organizations, we can fully achieve the negative aspects of childcare, elderly care, poverty relief, disaster relief, and medical care for the public, and on the positive side, we can improve people's lives, obtain full welfare, promote social and cultural progress, and consolidate the foundation of the country and the nation. From the above, we can see the importance of grassroots organizations. Next, let us further examine the following questions.</p>
<p>Looking at Chinese History</p>
<p>Looking at China's inherent history, our country certainly has a long and enduring life, but starting from the earliest written records, it has about four or five thousand years of history. Turning the pages of our Chinese history, we find that it is entirely filled with the rise and fall of governance and chaos, but there is always less governance and more chaos. Have you all read the Romance of the Three Kingdoms? You may remember that it begins by saying: "The general trend of the world is that after a long period of division, there must be unity, and after a long period of unity, there must be division." What is the reason for the division and unity of governance and chaos in our country's history? Why is it that the period of chaos is often very long, while the period of governance is often very short? In the four or five thousand years of Chinese history, how many years have there been of true peace and people truly living in peace and contentment? I am afraid it is too short. This is because we have never been able to preserve and improve the good grassroots organizations that China has always had. People are always in a state of panic and fear, with their lives and property unprotected, trapped in deep water and fiery pain from which they cannot extricate themselves. The "well system" of the Yellow Emperor era, the "well-field" and "rural settlement" systems of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties were all excellent grassroots organizations. In the Spring and Autumn period, there was the great statesman Guan Zhong, who, with his "track and neighborhood" method, enabled Duke Huan of Qi to unite the princes nine times and achieve the great feat of unifying the world. The extraordinary strength of the Qin state was due to Shang Yang's "mutual responsibility system of ten and five families," which was also the most fundamental and well-meaning grassroots organization. The Han and Tang dynasties were the golden age of our country, and their ability to promote national prestige was due to the Han's "rural pavilion" system and the Tang's "neighborhood" system, which were the best grassroots organizations. Therefore, they were able to expand their territories (foreigners call us Qin people, Han people, Tang people), maintain internal stability and external defense, and demonstrate great achievements. Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty created laws such as the Baojia and Baoma systems, which were very good systems for sound grassroots organizations at the time. However, due to various obstacles from conservative forces, they could not be implemented, and soon there was the Jingkang Incident, and then the Song Dynasty had to perish. Wang Yangming's "ten-family card system" in the Ming Dynasty was also not widely used or preserved. The roving bandits arose and swept through the country, and the Ming Dynasty still fell. From the perspective of our country's history, the failure to establish grassroots organizations is why we have perished twice. What a painful lesson! This enables us to deeply recognize the importance of the tomb-level organization.</p>
<p>In the history of our country, when turmoil occurred, it was always because the peasants of the time were excessively oppressed by tyrannical rulers, corrupt officials, and local bullies, forcing them to use popular uprisings and riots to overthrow the government and transform the country. If the people can live in peace and contentment, the country will be at peace. If they cannot get what they need and cannot make a living, riots will naturally occur. I come from the fields, and in my childhood, I personally saw my elders, brothers, sisters, suffering all kinds of oppression and pain in my hometown. The peasants' contribution to the country, especially in this resolute war of resistance, spending money and effort, shedding blood and sweat, only they have contributed the most and the greatest. For twenty-eight years, I have liked to be close to farmers and have worked hard in grassroots work, taking local self-government as my lifelong ideal career, willing to work for the people, willing to seek their freedom and liberation for the farmers. Based on this ideal, I am willing to work for this lofty ideal, as long as I have a breath, this ambition will not be slackened and I will continue to do it forever. If this work cannot be completed in my lifetime, my sons and grandsons will continue to do it.</p>
<p>Looking at the Teachings of the Father of the Nation</p>
<p>Looking at the teachings of the Father of the Nation, the two greatest figures in our country's history that I admire the most are Qin Shi Huang, who used a very grand spirit to fully unify the divided country, because the times were different, so the methods he adopted were purely autocratic, and the Father of the Nation, who recognized the mission of the times, followed the trend of the world, and used democratic methods to establish our country, he once said: "Local autonomy is the foundation of the Republic of China. The civil rights of the people in the three thousand counties of the country are like three thousand stone foundations. If the foundations are solid, the country is strong, and if the country is strong, our children and grandchildren will enjoy the same benefits." The politics of our country are different from those of other countries. The politics of our country are like building a house, always putting the beams and pillars first, without paying attention to building the foundation. Once a big storm comes, it will collapse. And most of the people in our country who are engaged in politics only want to be high officials and are unwilling to be small officials. Everyone only wants to concentrate in the cities, in the provinces, and in the central government, and they never want to pay attention to the grassroots work in the localities. Our country is not strong, and there is more chaos than governance, and more division than unity. This is like building a country in the way we build houses, and most people only want to be governors and presidents, and are unwilling to be township chiefs and village chiefs. This is really wrong.</p>
<p>But there is one kind of architecture in our country that is the best, and that is the pagoda. The president is like the top of a pagoda. I recently went to Hangzhou and made a special trip to climb the Liuhe Pagoda, which is thirteen stories high. It is said that it was built more than eight hundred years ago. Standing on the top of the pagoda, looking down at the sails and waves on the Qiantang River, I felt very happy. I had a feeling at the time that the builder of this pagoda could really be our guide in local self-government. (It is said to be a person from the Song Dynasty, but I forgot his name.) So, in the future, we should build our country like building a pagoda. Today, all of you here are very good engineers.</p>
<p>Looking at Modern History</p>
<p>Looking at modern history, the emerging United States on the other side of the Pacific has only been building its country for more than one hundred and sixty years, and England has only been around for more than one thousand years. How can they maintain their position in the world? Even a small country like Belgium has only been around for more than seven hundred years. How can they make people not dare to underestimate them? It can be said that it is entirely due to their good grassroots organization and sound local self-government work. Before and after the invasion of our country, before their defeat, the local self-government work in Japan was also good, but because they only focused on political organization and ignored economic organization, they only achieved a strong country, not a rich country. The greatness of President Roosevelt of the United States is known to the world, but after his death, President Truman, or people may think that he is more ordinary than President Luo, but the grassroots organization in their country is good, and the president is only the top of the pagoda. Whoever comes to be the top of the pagoda, the inherent strength of the country will not change. England is still the same. Prime Minister Churchill led the country in resisting Germany during the war and was invincible. After the war, Attlee of the Labor Party came to power and formed a cabinet, and the efficiency of national administration was not affected by Churchill's departure. It is also due to the good local self-government and the perfect grassroots organization.</p>
<p>Let's look at our China again. It's really pitiful! Because we are being attacked by internal and external troubles, so even though the tutelage period has ended and constitutional government is about to begin, we still cannot complete the local self-government work of one county and one town. We really feel that this is a great shame and humiliation. If we want to search hard, only Shanxi and Guangxi in the past had a little achievement. In addition, I personally saw the autonomous work in Zhenping, Deng County, Neixiang, and Zhejiang counties (collectively known as Wanxi) in Henan, where I served, and it was done quite well. There are two outstanding figures, one named Peng Yuting and the other named Ge Bietingfang. They especially did a good job in the "art" of making all the people soldiers, able to defend themselves. During the War of Resistance, it was not easy for the enemy and puppets to invade, protecting our borders of Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei. This time, Li Xiannian's troops sneaked in from Hubei and could not cross the Lei Pond for a step when they reached the Wanxi border. The other aspects of management, education, and nurturing were also done quite well. This is a rare miracle, so the next issue of the local self-government special issue that I am organizing will specially publish a "Wanxi Autonomous Center Special Issue" to commend them, encourage them, and make people rise up everywhere. If our countries can all pay attention to grassroots organization, local self-government work, and elected county magistrates like them, why can't it be completed sooner?</p>
<p>Looking at the Words of the President</p>
<p>Looking at the words of the President: The President created the new county system, which stipulates in the outline of the organization at all levels of the county; "The county is an autonomous unit, and the county is a legal person." Since the county is already a unit of local self-government, and it has the qualifications of a "legal person," it naturally has the right to be independent and autonomous according to law. Township is a basic unit, so it also has the qualifications of a "legal person." We can get full proof from the enactment of the new county system. How important is grassroots organization. For a truly noble ideal, we should use the spirit of acting bravely for righteousness, not hesitating when duty calls, and never changing our minds to complete this lofty ideal and sacred work. Therefore, I think that to achieve this ideal and work, we cannot ignore the following two measures:</p>
<p>Talent Goes Down and Rises</p>
<p>When we talk about how to complete the work that needs to be done in the grassroots organization, we cannot help but feel deeply that the first thing that is lacking in the townships is money, and the second is people, the so-called lack of talent. The township is just an empty shell. As mentioned above, talented people and rich people only want to run to the cities, provinces, and central government. They only want to be high officials and are unwilling to be small officials. Talented people go to other places to seek development. May I ask who can be found to do the management, education, nurturing, and sanitation work in the grassroots organization? I think the state should specially formulate a system that requires anyone in the locality, after graduating from middle school or university, to return to their hometown to work for at least one year, just like students who graduate from the Central Military Academy have to go to the company as interns after graduation. In this way, they can deeply understand the suffering of the people, the importance of grassroots organization, so that they will not forget the fundamentals, and at the same time, they can make their work power and knowledge experience more and stronger. On the other hand, the talents who are scattered to the outside world in the locality, the majority of people who are concentrated in the cities, provinces, or the central government, (that is, at least one-third of the people can be cut from the county, provincial, and central governments) let them return to the county and township to work in the grassroots organization, so that they can truly achieve the talent injection, and all undertakings can be gradually started, but the government must still complete a legal system to realize it.</p>
<p>After the talent injection is achieved, it is still necessary to supplement it with the talent rise, because a good talent, after doing ten or twenty years of grassroots work, will inevitably have the idea of not being willing to be lonely and striving for progress. If pressure is applied, it will inevitably lead to nothing. In local self-government work, we cannot just fulfill our obligations. The state should give salaries and establish official ranks, from township village chiefs to section chiefs, county magistrates, county magistrates can be promoted to commissioners, and commissioners can be promoted to committee members, department heads, and promoted layer by layer, and then to the central government, and a pseudo system must be completed so that grassroots organization personnel have the opportunity to rise. Secondly, the state should also formulate a standard for rewards and punishments and competitions, and conduct competitions and assessments within a certain method and within a certain period, for townships, counties, provinces, and the central government. Among townships and townships, and among counties and counties, which townships and which counties can eliminate disadvantages and solve problems that have not been resolved for hundreds of years? If they can be demonstrated, we can reward them as a model township model county, or a model township chief, or a county magistrate with special achievements. This township chief can be called a township heroine and be respected by the whole county, or the whole province, or the whole country. Naturally, talents will emerge in large numbers, otherwise, how many unknown heroes will be buried in our grassroots organization? Isn't it a pity? There are heroes at all levels, and talents will naturally rise up. This is an indispensable measure in establishing grassroots politics. If the methods are correct, the education is proper, and the encouragement is proper, then people can make the best use of their talents, land can be used to its fullest extent, things can be used to their fullest extent, and goods can flow smoothly.</p>
<p>Prospects for Grassroots Organizations</p>
<p>Gu Tinglin said: "Too many high officials lead to the chaos of the country, and too few low officials lead to the governance of the country." It makes a lot of sense. If there are too many high officials, sometimes there will inevitably be disagreements, instigations, alliances, and betrayals. Instead, they will forget the public for the sake of private gain and leave things undone. If there are more low officials, whether it is management, education, nurturing, or sanitation, everyone can still work together with one heart and devote themselves to their posts. Just take the word "Wei" in a village unit as an example. If the national military village team is well organized, in case of an emergency, whether it is a drumbeat or a gong, they can immediately gather guns, knives, sticks, spears, and extinguish a few bandits, and unite the forces of each township. The county government's forces and the country's army do not need to be used, let them all be put into national defense. Please see if this effect is great or not?</p>
<p>Let's talk about production again. Every village unit can dig a pond, and use the water in the pond to irrigate the fields, plant lotus roots, and raise fish. There are 470 village units in Jiangning County. If each village unit raises 100 jin of fish and plants 100 jin of lotus roots, how much will there be in total? As for other rural side businesses, it is the same. Every village unit can have the strength to support a disabled and helpless person. With more than 800,000 village units in the country, we can rescue more than 800,000 people. So, if the village organization is well run, the national government can really be carefree at that time. Conversely, just take the word "Wei" as an example again. If the state uses one soldier for each "Wei" in each village unit, the country will need these more than 800,000 soldiers, and each person will cost at least 1.2 million yuan per year. Just take a look, how much money will the country spend each year? This is beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Finally, we can deeply know that if the grassroots organization is good, the country's construction work will have a way. There will be no internal strife within the country. Just like the murders and arson by bandits everywhere today, it will not happen. The people will be able to live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, when the grassroots organization is completed and local self-government is realized, our China can forever stop civil wars and have long-term peace and stability. Why did Japan invade us in the past? Because we were a pan of loose sand without organization. Otherwise, with our large population, a breath of air or a drop of saliva could destroy him. We were not only lacking in political organization, but also lacking in economic organization. If we want to transform the destiny of the country and the nation, it is on all of you present today. When local self-government is completed, we will have a paradise everywhere, a beautiful land, and our descendants will be able to share happiness and become the most outstanding nation in the world. "Tang used seventy miles, and King Wen used a hundred miles to rule the world." May you all strive for it!</p>

<h3>Summer is Approaching: Be Careful of Fake Medicine</h3>
<p>Editor: Recently, it has been discovered on the market that Japanese fake medicines such as "Jintan" for summer use, "Jiuer" for scabies, and "Zhiyingzi" for coughs are being openly sold and flowing into the countryside. Purchasers are greedy for cheapness and do not investigate carefully, misleading patients and endangering their lives, which is extremely harmful. With the approach of summer, it is the active period for these fake medicines. Therefore, I hope that the health authorities will pay close attention to this and urge medicine buyers to be careful of fake goods and not be deceived. (Du Zhongrong)</p>

<h3>The Emergence of Literary Masterpieces</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>Commemorating the May Fourth Movement and Celebrating the Establishment of the "Shanghai Writers Association"</p>
<p>Today is the 28th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. Comparing the present with the past, what progress has been made? It is really difficult to say clearly.</p>
<p>First, the fervent mood in literature, art, and academia at that time is far beyond what can be compared to now. How substantial was the content of publications such as "New Youth," "New Tide," "Weekly Review," and "Sunday Review" at that time, and how firm and clear was their attitude? Especially the readers at that time, whether young or old, were humble and enthusiastic in their studies, with no preconceived notions and no selfish interests, with academia as the highest principle. Not only were they sincere towards various magazines, but they also devoted themselves to the supplements of every newspaper. Compared with the present, rather than saying that the readers of today are not as enthusiastic and sincere as before, it is better to say that the publications of today do not have the attractiveness of the past.</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of the times, politics at that time was the dark age of warlords. Although it was nominally a republic, the people had no say in domestic and foreign affairs. Now, the revolution has been successful, the War of Resistance has been won, and the call for democracy and constitutional government has reached its peak. However, the democratic spirit in literature, art, and politics is even less enthusiastic than it was twenty-eight years ago. This cannot but be blamed on our lack of effort as people who have a duty to the nation. I still remember that when we were students, we organized meetings, published periodicals, and invited famous experts to give lectures, all from the bottom of our hearts, without any intention of gaining power or fame. Everyone wore a blue cloth gown, and there was no disturbance from terms like dancing and movies, and even cigarettes and alcohol were not close to us. These words are of course difficult to avoid the criticism of being outdated and pedantic, but they can still be used as a reference for the national physique and national morality test.</p>
<p>Third, many people wonder: Why have no literary masterpieces been produced after the great era of the War of Resistance? Since the War of Resistance, knowledge has increased a lot, the meaning of life has been understood more, and there has been a great progress in the understanding of how to deal with oneself and how to deal with national affairs. But now it is in the process of brewing and organizing, and there is no doubt that literary masterpieces and artistic masterpieces will appear in the future. Western scholars believe that European and American societies are not rich enough, so they go to Africa to observe the lives of primitive people and study tropical diseases. China has all kinds of forms and nothing is impossible. It is really a good material for academia, so there is no need to be discouraged. I believe that China will surely produce the world's great scholars, not to mention literature and art. In the future, great masters unique to the world will also be produced in sociology, economics, and political science. Now they are being studied and sorted out, and they will surely amaze the world in the future.</p>
<p>But I hope that Chinese youth will not be discouraged, and I also hope that those who have the resources to lead young people will pay attention. This is the meaning of commemorating the Literary Arts Day and celebrating the establishment of the Shanghai Writers Association.</p>
<h3>Ode to the May Fourth Movement</h3>
<p>— Lv Baihua</p>
<p>Who defined the May Fourth Movement?</p>
<p>Days of unbearable spring chill;</p>
<p>This symbolizes the literary and artistic path,</p>
<p>How many rugged islands and hot and cold seasons it has passed through.</p>
<p>We don't want hearts of brocade,</p>
<p>Nor do we want mouths of gold;</p>
<p>A powerful giant pen,</p>
<p>Forever held in the hands that mend the sky.</p>
<p>Look!</p>
<p>Breaking through the spring cold,</p>
<p>Stars shine out of the ashes,</p>
<p>Literature and art are blooming on barren land!</p>
<h3>A Group·Several Businesses</h3>
<p>— Wang Jinshan</p>
<p>Some Opinions of the Preparatory Committee of the "Shanghai Writers Association" Regarding the Future Business of the Group</p>
<p>In the past, there have been many similar groups, and there have been precedents: holding an inaugural meeting, passing a few articles of association, and hanging a sign, and then disappearing without a trace, as if a great cause had been accomplished. The so-called scholars rebelling never succeed in three years; men of letters doing things are just carried away by their whims, and most things are started but never finished. Therefore, everyone hopes that the establishment of the Shanghai Writers Association will not be like this, cannot be like this, and dares to believe that it will not be like this.</p>
<p>In another article, I once talked about the organizational tasks of a literary group. In addition to the emotional connection between members and the cooperation in their careers, there is no need to shy away from striving for the freedom to write, protecting the rights and interests of writing, and then jointly establishing a new writing belief and creating a new style of modern Chinese literature and art.</p>
<p>During the preparation period, friends have expressed many valuable opinions. Everyone believes that the times have progressed, and the style should also change. Now, the group is more important than the individual, friendship is more important than political views, practice is more important than theory, and mutual assistance and cooperation are more important than personal development; mutual respect for freedom of thought and common respect for human wisdom and emotion; this cannot but be said to be the awakening of the Chinese intellectuals' thinking after the May Fourth Movement and after eight years of the War of Resistance. The reason why the preparatory work of the Shanghai Writers Association has been completed so quickly in the past month, and the reason why the recruitment of members has been so widespread and smooth, cannot but be said to be due to this common belief.</p>
<p>Therefore, the practice of organizational tasks in the future has become the main topic of today's inaugural meeting. The funding has not yet been sourced, and personnel cannot be determined, but everyone is convinced that spirit is more important than matter, and human resources are more important than material resources. As long as everyone has a common sense of purpose and a sense of responsibility as a member of their own group, even with money, things can be done, and without money, we must find a way to do it. In other words, as long as everyone still has the energy to contribute to our group, all sectors of society will definitely give us business connections and assistance. For the future of the Shanghai Writers Association and for the future of literary and artistic undertakings, it must be so, it should be so, and it must be so.</p>
<p>Here, we can try to list a few things to illustrate the business that a literary group can undertake.</p>
<p>For example, the introduction and evaluation of works is originally a kind of literary service or communication business, but the society has not yet progressed to the point of producing such an institution, but the actual needs already exist, and our group may as well take the responsibility without hesitation.</p>
<p>Specifically, the group can contact publishing institutions to compile literary series on behalf of them, or accept commissions from film and theater institutions to write film and theater scripts, cooperate with music groups to write lyrics, and cooperate with art groups to write works that emphasize both pictures and text.</p>
<p>If the government or other social groups hold literary awards, the group can accept commissions to handle the procedures for soliciting and recommending candidates.</p>
<p>It can also systematically select and translate excellent literary works and introduce them to foreign publishing circles; at the same time, it can also translate excellent foreign works to supply the needs of domestic publishing institutions.</p>
<p>In addition, improving the welfare of writers is also something that the group cannot ignore. The settlement of royalties and the registration of copyrights are cumbersome procedures, and most writers, being scholars by nature, do not bother to do this. The group can specially hire lawyers and accountants to serve as legal advisors for members on a regular basis. Similarly, we can specially hire doctors and hospitals to serve as medical advisors for members.</p>
<p>Then, specially contracted bookstores and publishers often give writers preferential treatment when buying books; specially contracted libraries try their best to facilitate writers' borrowing of reference books and periodicals, which is a matter of course, should be done, and can be done.</p>
<p>If there is sufficient funding or someone invests, the group can run its own publishing institution to publish members' works, as well as build clubhouses, hostels, and even literary and artistic new villages.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the connection of friendship, it is best not to forget to learn from each other and practice "meeting friends with literature and assisting benevolence with friends." Various tea parties, evening parties, appreciation meetings, commemorative meetings, as well as group tours and visits, and joint research and criticism, which are often held by general literary groups, are all activities that cost little and gain a lot in the group.</p>
<p>What's more, if we want to build a solid literary foundation for the next generation, guiding young people to write should also be a task that the Shanghai Writers Association cannot ignore. Evaluating and revising young people's works, inviting famous writers to talk about writing experience, holding short-term writing workshops, and recommending young people's works for publication or publication. Although the previous generation did not give us much help, we cannot therefore ignore it. "The younger generation is to be feared; how do you know that those who come later will not be equal to us?" This is what Confucius said long ago.</p>
<p>Unity is strength, and mutual assistance and cooperation are the way. In the past, literary people looked down on each other, which caused the division of the literary and artistic circles in the past and the desolation of the literary and artistic garden today. Wartime literary and artistic construction should undoubtedly be given equal importance to material construction; moreover, in terms of the form of literary and artistic works, it is just like the form of life of our generation. The old has been destroyed, and the new still needs to be worked hard. In this era, in order to pursue the harmony of ideals, we have to seek the harmony of reality; in order to establish a common belief, we have to give up the prejudices of various purposes; in order to create a new style of Chinese literature and art, we have to start with the establishment of a new organization. Although Shanghai writers dare not say that they want to be an example for writers from all over the country, the Shanghai Writers Association must give literary and artistic groups from all over the country a demonstration and a new perception. This is the case in fact, and even if we don't intend to do so, it must be so.</p>
<p>Note: Most of the arguments in this article are the results of the exchange of opinions among the preparatory committee members over the past month. The author is only acting as a representative and dare not take the credit.</p>
<h3>Congratulations on the Establishment of the "Shanghai Writers Association" Joy and Wishes</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Literary Writers Association," which has been in preparation for so long, has finally been officially established today!</p>
<p>"Officially established" brings us joy, but also brings worries</p>
<p>In the process of participating in the preparatory group, I have exchanged opinions with many friends. Everyone believes that it is urgently needed to organize a literary group in Shanghai, the cultural center. The question is how to organize it? What is the meaning of the organization? Therefore, Brother Jinshan publicly expressed our attitude to everyone in the Chunqiu on April 19. Here, I don't need to say much more. In order to express my personal sensitivity and wishes, it seems that I have to say a few words to fulfill my responsibilities.</p>
<p>Literature and art and politics are closely related. Therefore, in the past, a few people actually regarded literature and art as a tool of politics. Sinclair even said this: "All art is propaganda"; they regarded literary and artistic groups as military forces to seize political power. On the one hand, they sang the praises of democracy, but on the other hand, they closed the Xuan gate tightly, rejecting people thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Literary and artistic authors themselves should be absolutely free and detached. Their works should reflect everything of the times, not only affecting everything of the present, but also affecting future generations. Only such literature and art have life! Only such writers are worthy of being called great. Leaving aside the literature and art of ancient times and their authors, we will only take Cao Xueqin and Lu Xun, who are familiar to the public, as examples:</p>
<p>"Dream of the Red Chamber" and "The True Story of Ah Q," although are two works with different contents, their thought system is the same. They used sharp eyes to see through everything, and in their writing, they targeted reality and reflected everything of the times. Although readers have different views, they are after all two penetrating and vital masterpieces. Therefore, they can all win the love and respect of the broad masses.</p>
<p>In other words, Cao Xueqin and Lu Xun have fulfilled the duties of literature and art and completed the tasks of writers. In other words, their works are not used for politics. On the contrary, they have improved politics and led politics.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope to produce more such literature and art and such writers. Moreover, we hope that such liberal writers can unite to become a free writing group. They can increase friendship, get mutual assistance in life, complement each other in learning, and exert greater power in their careers. Therefore, we should not be divided by parties and beliefs, regardless of men, women, old or young, not shape idols and leaders, not close doors, and allow established writers and young people in learning to participate freely and breathe together in the air of freedom. This is our urgent desire and purpose for organizing this association.</p>

<h3>Is Good News Not News?</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>In the past, the petty bourgeoisie used to describe the abilities of ordinary superiors, saying: "Scholars do not go out, but they can know the affairs of the world." In the past, although there may not have been newspapers, official reports and residence copies may have existed. The so-called "affairs of the world" were only limited to the court, and folk news was not included. Today, some tabloids compete for victory with yellow news or insider news, which is regarded as catering to the popular taste. Compared with the boring sermons in official reports and residence copies, it is naturally not the same, but in terms of news morality, the former is still a "veritable record," while the latter is just exaggeration or fabrication.</p>
<p>What is worth studying is why so many people like to read this kind of news that they know is fabricated? - Is it because of the monotonous life? Or is it the increasingly decadent social atmosphere that is encouraging them?</p>
<p>The British Huxley once said a famous saying: "Good news is not news." The meaning of this sentence is actually "Dog bites man is not news, man bites dog is news." In a society where everything is abnormal, "normal" is far less popular than "abnormal." Reporting on the construction plan of a large bridge is far less attractive to readers than news about lust, theft, and killing. In such a situation, if some people cater to and seek favor, and compete for victory with "yellow" or "insider" news, it will naturally arouse the abnormal desires of readers, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>At the same time, we cannot simply blame reporters for creating yellow news. The corruption of social customs sometimes encourages them to talk nonsense and fabricate stories, and their nonsense and fabrication then turn around and affect social customs. Over time, it becomes a cycle, which will eventually plunge the entire society into a state of eternal ruin.</p>
<p>For example, the two recent cases of incest that occurred in Shanghai: hotel owner Chen Dada defiled his own daughter, and teahouse owner Du Quntu defiled his stepmother. The absurdity of the plot is somewhat beyond the imagination of the "yellow news fabricators"; as for the "Shen Wuye" case of transvestites uncovered in Elizabeth Apartment, the obscenity is even worse than the serialized novels in the tabloids. What else is there to say? At present, it seems that the entire society is moving towards the path of lust and killing, and the words such as etiquette, justice, integrity, and shame that are covering up "obscene behavior" may be even more difficult to understand than oracle bone inscriptions in the eyes of ordinary people. One day, scholars will have to come to study the true meaning of these four words.</p>
<p>I remembered what a reporter from a certain newspaper said after describing the "transvestite case":</p>
<p>"Now, Room 11 of the beautiful Elizabeth Apartment on Fuxing Middle Road is already empty, leaving the beautiful gauze curtain hanging empty, covering up everything in the room, just like the prosperity and wealth of this city, shielding all the debauchery and shamelessness."</p>
<p>Paper cannot cover up the fire. If you think that the beautiful gauze curtain can completely cover up the obscene behavior in the room, then "Shen Wuye" seems to still have a few years to live in the "palace"; if you think that the prosperity and wealth of the city can shield all debauchery and shamelessness, then how can the theft and incest cases in Shanghai Beach be published in newspapers?</p>
<p>If the future world can still be called a "paradise," I think the first condition must be "Only good news is considered news!"</p>
<h3>On Simplified Characters</h3>
<p>— Yi Bai</p>
<p>Chinese characters are complex in structure, which not only takes time to write, but also often confuses beginners and makes it difficult to remember, which has an impact on the popularization of education. In recent years, many people who are enthusiastic about education and philologists have been engaged in simplifying Chinese characters in order to eliminate illiteracy and promote mass education. The creation of simplified characters has gradually increased, and the illiterate masses are all claiming that it is convenient. However, the simplification of characters did not start in modern times. "Xiaoji" once recorded a story: "A Jinshi of the Tang Dynasty had a single surname and went to the examination hall. The chief examiner mistakenly wrote it as "Dan." Dan complained: "Although my clan is humble, I don't want my surname to be changed by others. Please correct it." The chief examiner said: "Is it worth arguing about the square mouth and the sharp mouth?" Dan said: "If it is not worth arguing about, then can the Wu'er County of Taizhou be changed to the Er County of Luzhou?" The chief examiner had nothing to say."</p>
<p>Among the current simplified characters, the symbols used for simplification do not have a certain standard, and it is necessary to discuss them. For example, the "Shang" on the left side of the word "敌" (dí, enemy) is simplified to "舌" (shé, tongue). If the "Shang" of the word "适" (shì, suitable) is also written as "舌", then it becomes the "适" (kuò) of Nanggong Kuo. Another example is that "怀" (huái, bosom) is written as "怀" and "还" (huán, return) is written as "还", then the simplified forms of "环" (huán, ring) and "環" (huán, surround) should be the same, "环". Furthermore, such as the "奚" (xī) beside "鷄" (jī, chicken), the "灌" (guàn) beside "漢" (hàn, Han), and the "葛" (gé) beside "歡" (huān, happy), all use the character "又" (yòu, again) to represent them, as "灌," "汉," and "欢." Three symbols are usable by one symbol, which makes it feel like "汉" cannot be made into "溪" (xī, stream) or "灌" (guàn), and "灌" cannot be made into "鶴" (hè, crane). Although it is because of custom, it is not reasonable after all. Beginners who do not know many characters are especially difficult to distinguish. I think that the symbols for simplified strokes must be uniform. If we replace "旧" (jiù, old) with "父" (fù, father), then "觀" (guān, view) becomes "观," "權" (quán, power) becomes "权," and "歡" (huān, happy) becomes "欢," without any doubt. However, "漢" (hàn, Han) can only be made into "濯" (zhuó, wash), not "英" (yīng, hero) or "溪" (xī). As for "灌" and "奚," other simple symbols should be used to represent them separately, so that the system is clear and not mixed up, which will be more beneficial for beginners. I wonder what the experts who are currently working on simplifying Chinese characters think?</p>
<h3>Pitiful Words</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhi</p>
<p>General Eisenhower told a story, he said: "After the end of the war in Europe, I was ordered to return to the United States by plane to participate in a certain meeting. Among the many passengers, there was a paratrooper, and he told me a lot about his flying experience, but when our plane landed, I found that he seemed very uneasy.</p>
<p>"Boy, what's wrong?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"General," he replied, trembling, "this is the first time I've landed in an airplane!"</p>
<h3>Dead Model Living Appearance</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Southern Song History records: "On the Lantern Festival of Gui Chou, the emperor (Lizong) summoned prostitutes into the palace. There was Tang Anlun, whose singing and appearance were unparalleled. The emperor loved and favored her.侍郎牟子才奏曰: 'These are all the temptations of Dong Songchen and others, which have destroyed your Majesty's twenty years of self-cultivation.' The emperor ordered Ding Daquan to issue an edict: "Loyalty is not forbidden, but do not distribute copies." Zi Cai then made a picture of Gao Lishi taking off his boots, and sent copies to those who were friendly with Song Chen. Song Chen was furious and said: "Verbal advice is still acceptable, but to draw this dead model living appearance? He took it in and said to the emperor: "Mou is scolding the official family." The emperor looked at the picture and laughed: "You are scolding you, not me."</p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, villains are mostly like this, their actions are smelly and ugly. Because they are guilty, they are even more afraid of others saying they are smelly and ugly. It is like people who have suffered from painful sores, fearing that others will touch their scars, which is exactly the same. Speaking of the characters and time of this story, when Lizong was facing south and calling himself lonely in the small court, the Xianghuai area had already been lost, and the alarms were alarming. At the critical moment of national affairs, a slight sense of conscience, would never be such a dog 　 enjoying the sounds and colors, absurd through the top of it. But he recruited prostitutes into the palace and was very happy. Dong Songchen, as a small yellow door, saw through the emperor's weaknesses and catered to his preferences to win favor and solidify his position. This is exactly the cleverness of small people, and the living appearance of their dead model. When other people draw his portrait, and even he himself feels a little uncomfortable, he becomes impatient, and does not want to correct his own dead model living appearance, but blames others for saying "Verbal advice is still acceptable, but to draw this dead model living appearance," and as a result, he cries to the master, attempting to seek revenge. It can be seen that the work of "self-restraint" is more difficult for small people. Or it may be said that this is the traditional spirit of the Chinese people. Don't you see Ah Q? With scabies growing on his head, he does not blame himself for being born badly, but everywhere he is taboo against others saying words like "light" and "bright." Isn't this the same reason as Dong Songchen's originally thorough dead model living behavior, but being ashamed and hating Mou Zicai's boots-off picture?</p>
<p>Today, the era of Huang Songchen is far away, and the era of Ah Q still exists. There are many people with dead model living appearances, and there are also many people who are afraid of being said to have dead model living appearances.</p>
<h3>Mr. De and Mr. Sai</h3>
<p>— Lei Ke</p>
<p>The two gentlemen in the title were introduced to the Chinese people in the year of the May Fourth Movement. However, for 28 years, these two gentlemen have been put aside, and not many people know them. Since they don't know them, they naturally don't pay attention to them, let alone treat them as partners affectionately. After 28 years, it is really too sorry for these two neglected guests to introduce them by name again.</p>
<p>Speaking of this matter, we have to admit the failure of the introduction at that time, which is also a part of the failure of the New Culture Movement. One of the fruits of the New Culture Movement was the expansion of vernacular Chinese, but unfortunately, this fruit was picked before it was ripe. The purpose of advocating vernacular Chinese is to unify spoken and written language, to popularize writing, and to make writing a tool for the masses. Because only when the masses can read and write can Mr. De and Mr. Sai be recognized and loved by the masses. Today's vernacular Chinese does not belong to the masses. It is still something possessed by a few people. No matter how vernacular we make vernacular Chinese, as long as the masses do not know it, they will be thousands of miles away from it and unable to touch it. Lacking this medium, it is always difficult to hope to introduce Mr. De and Mr. Sai to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The "May Fourth" Movement is called the Renaissance. The mistake is in this place. What we need is not a revival, but a thorough enlightenment movement. During the "May Fourth" Movement, we introduced a large amount of Western culture and worked hard to improve the tools of introduction. Unfortunately, we only saw the trees but not the forest, and only knew to spin around in vernacular Chinese, but did not hand vernacular Chinese over to the masses. There is no high theory, we have neglected basic education.</p>
<p>Popularized writing is important, but it is even more important for the masses to understand it. With the illiteracy rate in the country still accounting for more than 50 percent, it is difficult for the masses to recognize Mr. De and Mr. Sai. The characteristic of Mr. Sai is the scientific method, which is the idea that conforms to ubiquity, and the characteristic of Mr. De is mutual tolerance and the art of mutual compromise. If these things do not have education as a tool, they cannot penetrate into the masses, but can only become empty talk on paper for scholars, without the funds for realization. We do not object to the two gentlemen being introduced on stage again and again, but the eyes of the illiterate must be made to shine so that they can see the two gentlemen with their own eyes.</p>
<h3>"Cooperation"</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>She was repairing the car that had broken down on the narrow road, but the cars behind her were getting impatient and honking their horns desperately. Finally, she ran to the car behind her.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry, but I can't fix it." She said very gently to the driver, "If you can repair it for me, then I'd be very willing to stay here and honk the horn for you."</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"We've been waiting for more than a month. If there was no other way, I would never dare to bother Director Xiong again!" He smiled reluctantly and said with extremely tactful words: "Fortunately, we have no extravagant hopes. Any car will do, one is fine, two is even better...!"</p>
<p>Director Xiong raised his face and looked at the ceiling, showing a very impatient look.</p>
<p>"I heard that a batch of military vehicles will be driven back to Liuzhou tomorrow,..." Lao Zhu planned to gradually make his request more concrete.</p>
<p>But the door of the director's office was pushed open again. In came a young woman of about thirty years old, dressed very beautifully, with expressive eyebrows and eyes; a gust of fragrant wind blew in, immediately startling the young Director Xiong, who was about to fall asleep. He immediately jumped out of his seat and greeted her with a smile.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu was so disappointed that he almost wanted to leave in a huff.</p>
<p>The host and the female guest each occupied a sofa amidst laughter, and the conversation immediately unfolded very smoothly; Lao Zhu managed to suppress the anger in his heart with a piece of candy, pretending not to care, and sat in the back listening. But his mind was already in a mess, and he couldn't hear half of what was said. He only occasionally heard a word or two, vaguely knowing that this wealthy woman had come specifically to beg for help because her three trucks loaded with commercial goods had been blocked by the inspection office and were not allowed to pass; Director Xiong initially seemed to have made a set of official remarks, but he couldn't resist the charming woman's repeated use of gentle means, and she played with him until he lost all his will and had nothing to say.</p>
<p>"Then call me immediately! Don't forget your friendship after turning around!" Finally, the wealthy woman, who knew how to seize the opportunity, immediately forced Director Xiong to notify the inspection office on the highway by telephone to let the three trucks out of Guilin.</p>
<p>Director Xiong staggered back to his desk with intoxicating steps.</p>
<p>"Call back, and I'll treat you to dinner!" He said, staring at the wealthy woman with greasy powder, as he picked up the phone receiver.</p>
<p>This made Zhu Zhaonian very anxious.</p>
<p>"What's the rush? That's how you are!" The wealthy woman twisted her head! Jiao Chen said: "I'll treat you in the evening!" Perhaps she really didn't have time at noon, or perhaps she had already eaten.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The next six or seven minutes passed quickly. The wealthy woman saw that her goal had been achieved and was unwilling to entangle with the easily impulsive young military officer anymore. Although Director Xiong had been provoked to excitement, there was no way to force her to stay because the other party insisted on leaving. (62)</p>
