<p>〔聯合社南京六日電〕據熟悉內情人士今日吿聯合社稱，蘇方對旅大問題覆文，殊不能滿意，但覆文內容，未便披露。蘇方對旅順地區所抱立塲，係以「對日和約尙未簽訂故戰爭狀態在技術上繼續存在」爲根據，中國認爲此種立塲，殊與現實不符，因日本早已戰敗，成被佔領國家。大連旅順兩地，一如燕北其他區域，主權全屬中國，此乃中蘇條約明白規定者。世大連郊外現有共軍，中國若無軍隊保護，殆無接收該區行政之望，僅藉警察，顯然無濟於事。</p>

<h3>社論　正視目前的經濟危機</h3>
<p>最近兩星期以來，米價瘋狂飛漲，其他一切物價，也無一不直綫上昇，漲勢之猛，實在太驚人了，使人人的生活都感到威脅，尤其是一般靠薪水或工資收入的人們，幾乎要惶惶然不可終日；自二月中旬政府實施經濟緊急措置辦法以來，生活的指數是被凍結了；但是物價不僅沒有抑平，而且日漲夜大，以米價一項而論，兩個多月來，就漲了二三倍：在這種物價與薪給不平衡的狀態下，要求解凍生活指數的呼聲，也就跟着物價的飛漲而日益高漲。這一個問題，不僅爲社會所注意，而且也爲政府所重視，據本報南京電，行政院會議昨晨也曾討論及解凍生活指數的問題，聞在原則上已表示同意，僅對於解凍的具體辦法，尙待從長計議而已；大約在本月中旬，這個問題，就可以獲得合理的解決。但是我們在物價瘋在飛漲的情形之下，除了全國工人要求解凍生活指數而外，最使我們關切的，要算是爲國家服務效勞的公務人員和軍隊士兵的待遇了。以其收入之菲薄，在目前高物價的壓迫之下，幾乎要無法生活下去，其影響所及，對於國家社會，也將有非常密切的關係，使我們不能不替他們向朝野呼籲，以喚起大家的注意。</p>
<p>戰後我國經濟困難，旣是不可否認的事實，自然也無庸諱言：其實戰後的世界各國，就是在英法蘇等國，在長期戰爭之後，也沒有一個國家不在那要鬧着糧荒媒荒；也沒有一個國家不在那裏嚷着經濟困難，只是他們多有良策美計，對於如何應付戰後經濟困難，各有其妥善的辦法。例如在英國，經濟困難的情形，並不亞於我國，貝文外相最近自莫斯科返國，也憤慨萬分的說：英國在外交上最感困難的地方，就是在英國『旣無煤斤出口，又無貨物及款項可以貸與他國。』</p>
<p>英國在經濟上自顧不暇，可於此獲一明證。其次是法國，在勃魯姆內閣時代，因爲物價的高漲，致使工潮泛濫及全國，乃毅然決然，實行抑低物價政策，雖能奏效於一時，但是到了賴瑪迪埃內閣，抑平物價的政策，並沒有獲得預定的效果，因此工人要求增加工資的運動，也就由此面發生，共產黨贊成工人的要求，投票反對內閣的政策，以致在政界引起了軒然巨波，使共產黨閣員不得不退出內閣；這一幕政潮，雖已到了尾聲，但是法國的政局將來如何演變下去，尙難逆料。最後是蘇聯，戰後蘇聯國內復興的神速，固然令人欽佩，但是蘇聯在大戰期間所受的創傷，實在太大太深了：所以在經濟上，仍感到相當的困難，第一次發行的國內公債，快要用完了，到如今又不得不再發行第二次國內公債二百萬萬盧布；僅以此點而論，也可以看出蘇聯經濟的全貌了。</p>
<p>但是在英法蘇等國，不論物資如何缺乏；不論經濟如何困難，終還能保持國民經濟生活的平靜，尤共在英國，人民衣食住行日常所需要的物品，至今還實行着戰時的配給制皮，倫敦從未因必需品的匱乏而發生黑市，最近英國人民還發起一種國民節約儲蓄運動，以協助政府早日完威復興偉業：英國從來沒有像我國，常常發生物價飛漲的風潮，從這一點看來，我們敢大朋地說，我國經濟雖極困難，但是安定民生穩定物價，決不是沒有辦法的。戰後我國物價，不斷的上漲，原因固然不一而足。但是主要的原因，厥在我國當局未能統盤籌劃，確立一個完整的經濟政策，只知頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，而且醫頭醫脚的藥方，往往朝令夕改，不待方案貫澈，卽另換新方案。我們檢討一下戰後二年來的經濟政策，我們不能不指出，宋院長時期的經濟政策，失敗在自由貿易，根本不知珍惜外匯，而聽任人民自由向國外訂購物資，以致外貨充斥市塲，工商衰落，外匯枯竭，無法支持，後來雖已覺悟，改採管制辦法；但是洪水業經泛濫，再修堤防，已不可收拾了。今年二月間實行的經濟緊急措置辦法，就是這樣產生的。但是這個措置實行未久，宋院長辭職，政府醞釀着改組，一直到四月下旬，改組後的新政府始告成立，所以這個緊急措置辦法，可以說，始終沒有切實執行；而且張院長首次出席立法院，卽率直表示，經濟緊急措置卽將加以修正或廢除。同時上海食米的限價，也奉命取消，而准許自由買賣；使頭腦最簡單的人，也會知道政府的經濟政策，又將有根本改變的可能，何况上海素來是一個投機市塲，沒有事情的時候，當常要捕風捉影，企圖興風作浪；現在他們聽了張院長的表示，當然是投機的絕好理由。所以這幾天市面的混亂，固然是人爲的因素所造成；但是政府言行的矛盾，不能不負相當的責任。我們不得不在此指出下列二點，以喚醒全國朝野的注意。</p>
<p>第一，我們認爲改組後的新政府，應付當前的經濟難關，只有在下面兩條道路中，抉擇一條。一是繼承宋院長時代的經濟政策，加强經濟的管制，切實實施經濟緊急措置辦法，不達目的不止；二是採取新的方案，實行新的辦法。但若政府舍舊路而走新路，則我們要求政府注意下列數點。（一）新政策須經深思熟慮之後，認爲有絕對把握。始可採行；萬萬不可以嘗試的態度出之；（二）在政策改變的時候，千萬要保守機密，因爲在政策改變的前後，最易引起金融界的風潮；（三）要採取新方案，就要立卽拿出辦法來，不能再拖延了。</p>
<p>第二，我們要社會大家都能認淸目前的危機，若不早日設法挽救，則長此以往，徒然替共產黨造機會，我們大家都知道，共產主義不適合於中國，因爲中國社會，並無貧富懸殊的現象：但是目下的經濟情形，正在使社會加速分化而爲兩大階級。能投機取巧的人。就能暴發暴富；安分守己的正當商人，反而不能立足於社會，這種情形，如果不能以民生主義的政策來挽救，則今日的社會豈不在替共產黨造機會！</p>
<p>要之，目前國內的經濟局勢。嚴重到極點，已到了總崩潰的邊緣；但是我們終認爲人力勝天：只要全國上下，能認淸一個共同目標。同心戮力。能克服一切困難；他國所能安渡的難關，我們相信我國也必能安然渡過去，而到繁興富强的彼岸！</p>

<h3>猶太代表出席問題　聯大通過折衷案　准許在政委會陳述意見</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約弗魯辛草地五日電〕聯合國大會全體會議，今日以四十四票對七票，又三票棄權，通過決議案，命政治委員會聽取猶太公會代表關於巴勒斯坦問題之意見。決議案並規定巴勒斯坦人民其他部份所述意見，應交由政治委員會取決，此乃被蘭提案與美國提案折衷之結果。關於捷克與波蘭所提猶太公會代表向全體大會發表意見一項建議，則已卅九票對八票，又七票棄權加以否決。猶汰代表陳述意見辦法決定後，注意力現集中於巴勒斯坦高級委會要求陳述意見一項問題，聞阿拉伯同盟曾訓令各會員國堅持猶太公會代表倘許其陳述意見，則阿拉伯高級委員會亦得陳述意見。</p>

<h3>英帝國參謀會議　討論海陸空合作問題　海外英駐軍總司令均出席</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦五日專電〕英國戰後最大之國防會議今日開始，出席者爲英國及英帝國之總司令，其中包括陸軍元帥及將官七十六人，海軍將官及高級海軍官四十四人，海軍陸戰隊將官五人及一部分高級空軍軍官。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕英國海陸空三軍將領，本日在桑德赫斯特軍校舉行秘密會議，由陸軍參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥主席，此乃計劃諾曼第登陸以還最要之軍事會議。世界各地英軍司令，如日境英國佔領軍總司令羅柏遜將軍等，均奉召返國參加會議。據消息靈通人士稱，觀於英國高級將領均認爲海陸空三軍分立，在現代戰爭中已爲陳舊之制度，故此次會議對於三軍密切合作問題，殆將加以討論。此外關於新武器及其用途問題，亦將討論及此。僅就空軍力量而言，皇家空軍司令嘗稱原子時代之降臨，即大規模轟炸隊消失之謂，聞海軍部現尙不能確定原子彈對於海軍之影響。若干方面預料海軍將利用航空母艦裝載置有原子彈之飛機，但商船隊及護校隊之利用問題，並不能因而獲得解決。</p>

<h3>衆院開始辯論美援助希土案</h3>

<h3>消息報評論馬歇爾演說　謂其目的乃在嫁罪蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科五日電〕「消息報」今日發表社論，長達一頁，闡明蘇聯前禾淸晰確定之態度，指斥美國務院支持反動份子「鼓勵對蘇敵視」，並譴責美國務卿馬歇爾將莫斯科外長會議失敗「歸咎蘇聯，意存誹謗。」多數蘇聯人士相信美國務院大體反蘇，本不諱言，但筆之於報章則以此次「消息報」社論爲噶矢。據稱，四月二十八日馬歇爾向美國人民廣播報吿外長會議經過實屬「失實」。參議員范登堡旣謂馬氏演詞事先曾經民主共和二黨領袖在白宮討論，可見一般反蘇情緒較諸國務院尤深。馬氏演飼已訟人對於外長會議產生一種「錯誤印象」，嫁罪蘇聯代表團缺乏協議誠意，藉以證明其自身行爲正當，引起美國人民不滿蘇聯政策。馬歇爾顧問杜勒斯之會議工作廣播報吿同樣「歪曲事實」。馬氏給予該會以一種不準確評價，其故顯因辯論德國問題時美英代表立塲決非嘗試建立健全和平與預防侵略之眞正保證云。</p>
<h3>法政局仍未穩定　美可能助法拘救經濟危機　惟以推行防共政策爲條件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫教六日廣播：法國政府此次公然排斥共產黨，在解放後尙係初次嘗試，此項政策今已遭遇嚴重之試騐。社會黨代表四百人今召開全國會議，對共產五閣被逐出聯合內閣一事，投票表決。倘遭否決，則政府將吿傾覆，同時法國將面臨近年來最嚴重之政治危機。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎六日電〕法國星期日之政潮，疾風雖已平息，但在此社會黨召開全國代表會議以對改組賴瑪迪內閣作最後決議之時，政局仍未見穩定。此間政界人士頃談稱，賴瑪迪殆將根據社會黨國會議員團之協議，組織共黨並不參加之內閣。全國代表會議多數意見當將贊成此議，但各省社會黨員之意見，自亦將考慮及之。以言未來內閣之經濟調整措施，急進黨當將設法推行較國民經濟部長費里浦所採取者更爲自由之經濟政策，或將提出更迭經濟部長之要求。據悉，人民共和黨國會議員團昨日舉行集會，副總理曁該黨領袖戴德香對於共黨理解關於政府之問題及覓取解決方案之善意，曾加以讚揚。此間若干觀察家推斷倘社會黨全國會議拒絕與共黨破裂，則人民共和黨或將提出領導下屆內閣之建議。同時政治觀察家對於法國勞工聯合會擁護薪給階級，要求改善生活情形一事，極爲注意，衆人並料巴黎目前意外之平靜狀態，或將繼之發生社會困難之局面。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎五日電〕美官方高級人士今日宣稱，美國可能加緊援助法國經濟危機，惟以賴瑪迪總理能團結其非共產主義聯合新內閣爲條件。據悉，美大使館要員對於法政府需要何種援助及其數量，現正起草詳細報吿。預料法國對於解決糧食，燃料，及工業問題方面尙有新要求，故該報吿書須待修改，始可送達華府。美國準備支持此西歐防共新壁壘之決定因素，端視賴瑪迪所領導之法國社會黨有意成爲推行美國防共政策之工具與否。社會黨若能繼續領導反共聯合內閣，美國可望寄予同情，助其維持凍結薪資，抑平物價，及增加生產等經濟政策。其他人士並稱，美方態度已由駐法大使卡佛萊轉達共黨以外各政黨領袖。但據聞共黨或將利用其左右工會聯合六百萬會員之潛力，鼓動總罷工。</p>

<h3>法工會對政府展開勞戰爭</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎五日電〕法政府排斥五共黨閣員退出政府後，共黨所控制之工會，頃已對政府展開勞工戰爭，工潮及加薪要求有蔓延全國之勢。估計罷工人數已達四萬二千人之多，另有一萬三千人亦提出加並薪要求，倘予拒絕，亦有釀成罷曰工之　。</p>
<h3>美向巴拿馬提出　防衛運河新條約　美擬繼續使用巴基地</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：關於巴拿馬運河防衛新約，美國已向巴拿馬當局提出，該項新約規定美方繼續使用巴拿馬共和國境內之軍事基地。按在戰爭時期，巴拿馬曾以一百三十四處基地供給美軍使用，保衛巴拿馬運河。和平後，九十八處已交還巴拿馬當局，其餘三十六處則因有關空運與航運之安全，仍由美軍使用。</p>
<h3>法內閣會議　討論馬島局勢</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎五日電〕共產黨退出後之法國內閣，今日首次開會，討論東非馬達加斯加島叛亂事件，代理國防部長台爾博斯報告叛亂已受控制，但尙未敉平，當即決定派遣步兵與空軍前往該島增援。</p>
<p>戰況激烈</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕巴黎今日接訊，印度洋馬達加期加島法軍與叛黨交戰，已逾匝月，最近數日展開演泛軍事行動，叛亂土人喪生者一百五十名，負傷者百餘人。馬島東海岸一帶及丹那那里芙迤南山嶺，戰况激烈，法方傘兵出動作戰，馬島土人似以截斷法軍交通綫爲目的。</p>
<h3>法越有議和跡象　西貢法方否認呼籲和平</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社西貢五日電〕外傳法國駐越南高級專員波拉特已開始向雙方呼籲，和平解決法越衝突，此說頃由此間負責人士予以否認。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕法政府與越盟政府大約可於本週閒始談判，以圓結束戰爭。本社西貢來電，透露越南之衝突，可望早日停止，以使解決糾紛之談判得在和平空氣中進行；本社巴黎來電，亦謂法政府已在考慮解決越局之條件。據日巴黎可靠方面探悉，越盟政府已以半官方式，向法國駐越高級專員波拉特試探和平。法政府已在考慮成立解決辦法之條件，今日之內閣會議，即曾論及此事。同時西貢關係方面謂法政府與胡志明政府代表之談判，週末以前可在河內附近舉行，談判基礎尙在嚴守秘密中。越局之急轉直下，想係法陸長弗勞雷，海長謝基諾巡視越北軍事局勢之結果。</p>
<h3>英傘兵部隊　搜索聖城逃犯</h3>

<h3>根除季罪傾向切云積竊前腦</h3>
<p>外科醫術一大成就</p>
<p>〔聯合社匹茲堡五日電〕今日據悉：以腦部開刀手術剷除人類犯罪傾向之工作現巳實行，是爲外科醫學上一大成就。緣有慣於竊盜之賴德其人者，現年三八歲，積案櫐櫐，遠溯至一九二八年前，根據刑法，可判無期徒刑，遂請准亞里希尼州法庭，甘願接受前腦解剖實騐。在手術室內由柯斯哥夫博士開刀歷三小時，法庭行爲精神病學家一人在旁監視，將前腦自餘部分離。今日已精神煥發，健康如常。此種手術，非不經見，新神病學機關中屢會實施，頗著成效。但出於犯人申請，則賴德一例，尙屬創舉。賴德是否能從今棄暗投明，猶待此後行爲證明。</p>
<h3>美將舉行貿易週　謀擴大進口貿易</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕美國將於五月十八至二十四日期內，慶祝「世界貿易週」，其宗旨乃在擴大進口貿易，而非向爲美國傳統貿易政策之主要目標增進出口貿易。據目前最有利之預測，謂美國商品之出口，在一九四七年，可能達到一百十億美元，但進口貨物之估計，罕能超過六十億美元，其結果使美國及世界他國之最卓越之經濟學家深爲詫異，即此項鎼隙，如何彌補。不能找到補救辦法，則使一九二九年引起世界嚴重經濟蕭條之形勢，有重行出現之危險。</p>
<h3>日閣僚昨提辭呈　內閣總辭日期將由首相決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京六日電〕日政府六日奉日皇命令，定五月廿八日正式召開新議會。若千觀察家相信，日皇指定新議會召開日期後，內閣或即在今日辭職。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京六日電〕日政府定例閣議仍於六日在首相官邸舉行，吉田首相因病未出席。會議中首即議決五月二十日召集國會一案，繼之討論總辭職之手續問題。於此林內閣書記官長說明此次總選舉後有關吉田內閣之進退態度，繼即收集各閣僚之辭呈，並由佐籐內閣總務課長送往外相官邸，交付吉田首相。內聞書記官長林讓治及內閣法制局長官入江俊郎亦已向內閣提出辭呈。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京六日電〕因次期政權之談判尙未成熟，依據新憲法第七十條規定，內閣總辭職之日期問題，有將延至二十日新國會召集日之勢，故本”閣議中，就總辭職日期問題，決議聽任首相處理。現已提出辭呈之各閣僚，仍將依首相之意思而決定其辭職日期云。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾與國會議員　會商推行廣播計劃　衆院院支委會主張取消</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓六日電〕國務卿馬歇爾昨夜曾與代理國務卿艾克遜美駐蘇大使史密士及重要國會議員進行會談，歷二小時之久，討諭關於向外國繼續短彼廣播一事。會談目的乃在取得三千一百萬美元之經費，以便進行此項短波宣傳計劃。國會方面對此則希望加以取消。馬歇爾與艾克遜在會談時曾一再力言世界現正受謊言宣傳之毒素，故必須使人民接近事實之眞相，國會議員持何態度，國務院發言人在會後拒不加以評論。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓五日電〕衆議院度支委員會本日通過小組委員會之建議，將「美國呼聲」對蘇聯廣播計劃，予以取消。國務卿馬歇爾雖表示渠已請國會領袖維持此一廣播計劃，但仍無效。此外在蘇聯境內發行之俄文一美國」雜誌，亦將停刋。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕衆院度支委員會主席泰勃本日談稱：該委員會擬於政府，工業界及國會方面與國務卿馬歇爾舉行聯席會議之後，仍將堅持該委員會之決定，以取消國務院對蘇聯之「美國呼聲」廣播節目，及對歐亞二洲之其他廣播節目。依目前跡象而言，馬歇爾此後殆將以全力從事於參院內之辯論，蓋參院通常較衆院容易批准政府之經費。先是，馬歇爾曾傳回美國駐蘇大使史密斯與國會重要領袖進行會議，擬避免國會方面削减經費而繼續維持廣播節目。按史密斯業於三日應召返國，乃首先主張國務院用俄語向蘇聯廣播者。史密斯曾吿參加會議之參衆二院議員約廿五人稱，許多蘇聯人士曾私下告渠謂，「美國呼聲」給予彼等之印象殊深。據渠估計，蘇聯在一九五〇年將有短波收音機七百五十萬架。渠並認爲此項節目足以推反蘇聯指斥美國爲軍國主義及帝國主義之共產黨宣傳品。</p>
<h3>日皇晋謁麥帥</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京六日電〕日皇裕仁偕宮內大臣松平，侍從大臣及譯員等三人於本日上午十時十五分赴美大使館謁見麥帥，會談一小時而退。此爲日本投降以來裕仁第四次會見麥帥，亦爲五月三日新憲法實施後，一切政治特權被褫奪以後之裕仁第一次會見麥帥。據麥帥之發言人談稱，二人僅討論「例行公事。」但一般認爲裕仁在政治特權被遞奪以後往訪麥帥，必係二人互相祝賀日本之進入此一新時代。同時，議會選舉後之政治局勢殊爲混亂，日人方面傳盟軍總部或將出面調停，俾聯合內閣得以成立。</p>
<h3>日機非法濫炸　戰犯尚圖猛將賴</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京五，合衆電〕東州京國際戰罪法庭今繼續開　，被吿律師竭力卸脫日本空軍被控在所謂「中國事變」期間，非法　施轟炸之罪狀。日前海軍省　問權本供稱：日空軍確注意國際空　慣例與規則；復稱，海牙會議所通過之各項規則雖未經批准，但日本在華作戰時，確會遵守各該規則。渠又提出一項文件，以示何種目標，應加以轟炸，及何種目標，應避免轟炸。並指出敎堂，　字，神社，圖書館，及無關軍事之地點，均在不應轟炸之列。根本又稱，當局會命令日空軍在轟炸時，「極力愼重，」以防損失第三國或其國民之財產。末稱：故意轟炸平民，以達成威脅目的之事，乃不容許者。</p>

<h3>印度種族鬥爭　甘地歸罪英國　稱英軍應儘速退出印度</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里五日電〕甘地今日在德里接見本社記者，作四十分鐘之談話。表示英國之決定於明年六月退出印度雖屬可貴，然英國若能於目前即行退出，豈不更佳。甘地盤膝而坐，當記者往訪前，已連續接見尼赫魯等多人，但仍毫無倦容。記者詢以如至一九四八年六月，回印爭執猶未解決，英國是否有繼續留印之道義上的義務？甘地答稱：英國如於目前即行退出，殊屬佳舉，再等十三個月，對印度實爲禍患。余並不懷疑英內閣宣言之可貴以及印督之誠意，然事實終屬事實，當非英內閣或總督所能變更者。</p>
<h3>歐洲發現最古人骨</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社德國漢堡五日電〕據傳羅納堡區已發現歐洲古之人骨，其年代遠在洪水時期以前，實爲人類遺跡之新發現。</p>
<h3>蒙巴頓報告書中　曾建議印回分治　若干軍事家表示反對</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕關於印督蒙巴頓交由其顧問伊斯美向英內閣提出之報吿書，頃據政界人士談稱，該項報告書並不包含任何對於印度現行難局之確切解決辦法，但包括數項解決辦法，可任擇其一。其中一項爲劃分印度爲巴基斯坦·印度斯坦。及若干藩王之自主邦。各該解決辦法將向印度各領袖分別提出，或舉行圓桌會議，同時提出。此外又據若干軍事專家稱：回教徒若在印度西北邊區設立巴基斯坦，則印度國防將極感困難，英國政府實應接受內閣代表團之建議，即予回盟以一切可能之權利，但在外交及交通方面則維持印度之統一。</p>
<p>倚賴心理實屬可恥</p>
<p>今日之印度，已被訓練成惟英國之力量是賴，此項心理，一時已不易改變，在今後十三三個月，印度各方面，均當唯英內閣及印督之馬首是瞻。今人人均盼望英國軍力之援助，此誠可恥之現象。印度並無自治制度，僅有強迫人民接受之制度，故英國一旦撤退，難免使印度陷入混亂。余認印度之種族鬥爭，乃英人在印之結果。英人如不在印，吾人雖亦不免有戰鬥，但此項戰鬥，當已能使吾人自行澄淸矣。記者又詢英國退出印度後、英印關係如何？答曰：英國若能本於至誠，完全退出，英印必能維持最友好之關係。</p>
<p>世界趨向另一決鬥</p>
<p>問：聯合國機構能雜持持久和平否，答：無人能否認世界已趨向另一決鬥之途，但印度之一切均有順利進展，則世界必能有久長之和平。</p>
<h3>史泰遜評論援助希土案　認爲此係消極辦法</h3>

<h3>指數本月決解凍工資計算分八級　官方透露目前指數約爲一萬五千倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕可靠方面消息。此次社會部谷部長正綱在滬與各方面商定之生活指數解凍方案，爲工資在三十元以下者，全部依指數計算，三十元至四十元者打一九五折，四十元至五十元者再加九五折；以上者依此類推。至於目前之指數，官方雖未公佈，但據政府要員方面透露，約在一萬五千左右。記者頃以對此方案之意見，詢諸勞資兩方，其所得之反應如下：勞方認爲一月份之白米每担不過十萬元，目前之售價爲三十萬元，其餘物價上漲亦不止一倍，甚盼指數之計算，能與實際情形一致。資方之意見，則認爲目前工人之底薪大部在三十元至五十元之間，依此方案計算，等於未打折扣，指數凍結四個月，一旦突然解凍。若干廠家恐不能負担，至於工廠成品之價格，固已上漲一倍以上，按理應有力負担；惟原料價格已上漲十倍以上，故就工廠而言，亦有其實際困難。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中央對生活指數，決定解凍，並已內定四項辦法：（一）凡係各廠產業工人，工資在卅元以下者，一律照生活指數計算。（二）在三十元以上者，遂級打折扣，計分下列八級：1卅一元至四十五元，2四十六元至六十元，3六十一元至九十元，4九十一元至一百廿元，5一百二十一元至一百五十元，6一百五十一元至一百八十元，7一百八十一元至兩百十元，8二百十一元以上。以上八級，每級均打折扣，級數愈高，折扣愈小，但折扣相差距離，並不甚遠。（三）指數解凍後，如資方確實無力負擔者，得由勞資雙方自行協商後，另訂發給工資標準，呈報主管當局備案後實行。（四）此項辦法之施行日期，於本月份開始。（即指數於本月份必定解凍）。以上四項辦法，待最高當局作最後核定後，即可公布施行，故生活指數之解凍，於本月內決可實現。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕生活指數解凍原則，業經主管當局決定。惟此一問題，牽涉二月十六日國防最高委員會所通過之經濟緊急措施方案之規定，且解凍後之各項技術間題，及其可能發生之影響，關係至大，現正由社會部與各方審愼硏討中。聞詳細辦法，旬日內即可公佈，聞職工工資在卅元以下者，其工資依生活指數發給，卅元以上者，分爲若干等級，依生活指數折扣發給，同時將現有之差額金辦法取消。</p>

<h3>社會服務　讀者諮詢</h3>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（一）雀巢鳩佔</p>
<p>吳志萍問舍親某甲有自產店面一間，於民國廿五年間於租與乙。未訂租約，亦無證人。雙方言明甲方如欲自用隨時可以收回，民國三十年甲故世，房租由用妻丙收取。至民國三十二年甲子（丁）成年，欲收回自用，即通知乙方，請其於三個月內遷出，乙即允許，三月後乙因房屋難尋，丙允延期三月，又三月後，丙再請乙遷讓，乙竟毁約，堅持不讓。因此丙方自卅二年秋起即拒收房租今已三年請問（一）丙之店面確係自用能否收回？（二）三年未收房租，丙可否控吿乙强佔罪？（三）丙收回自用有相當證明，是否即可使乙遷出？</p>
<p>〔姜屏藩律師答〕（一）丙之店面，如確係自用，依照土地法第一百條第一款規定自可向乙收回。（二）三年朱收房租，與欠租情形不同，在雙方之租貸契約未經合法終止以前，不發生强佔問題，丙不得向乙控吿强佔房屋。（三）丙之收回自用，旣有相當證明，可訴諸法院，請求判令乙遷讓出屋。</p>
<p>（二）債務訴訟</p>
<p>丁權問（一）法律規定控訴權爲十五年，但抗戰八年是否得扣除計算？則原被吿一在內地，一在淪陷區，則訴訟如何辦法？（二）戰前之債務事隔十年，得請求增加若千？（三）現在被吿在上海，原吿在常州，可否在常州起訴？</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕（一）民法或其他法律所定行使權利之期間，因戰事不能遵守者，於復員後辦理民事訴訟補充條例施行後二年內（該條例於三十四年十二月二月十八日施行）仍得行使權利，但其原定期間，短於二年者，僅得於該條例施行後六個月內行使之，（見復員後民事訴訟補充條例第七條）（二）戰前之債務，依法固得請求法院增加給付，但其增加給付之標準，應由法院公平裁量之。（三）民事訴訟法第二十四條規定「當事人得以合意定第一審管轄法院，但以關於由一定法律關係而生之訴訟爲限」，「前項合意　以文書證之。」</p>

<h3>在結束了八年抗戰的大時代裏　怎樣做一個建國青年　（續五日完）</h3>
<p>— 周緝熙</p>
<p>訓練科學知能</p>
<p>第三，我們要做一個建國靑年，須有科學的知能。現在的世界，是一個科學的世界。科學的力量，足以決定世界的一切。漫大烽火，殃及全球的第二次世界大戰，因爲德國有七十噸的坦克車，有磁性水雷等的科學武器，才顯出希特拉的兇猛，而曾叱咤風雲，席捲歐陸，横行一時。假如英國當時沒有新式的反坦克砲，沒有深水炸彈和破磁性水雷的發明，還能轉危為安，轉敗爲勝嗎？等到前年八月，美國發明的兩顆原子彈，在日本初顯身手，竟使横行東亞的數百萬日本皇軍，俯苜就範，日本天皇，戰慄着率領數千萬臣民敬向我們宣佈無條件投降，因此結束了血戰近十年，流血遍全球的世界大變。這不是科學的力量，科學的決戰嗎？所以我們要建國强國，生存在這個科學的世界，必須發展科學，要發展我國的科學，我國就必須有較現有的多數千倍以上的科學工作者；並且其中多數的工作成績必須是世界上第一流的。到了有這樣多的科學工作者和有這樣好的成績，並且科學的方法能够普遍的應用到解決各種生活問題的時候；科學方才能在中國的領土裏生根長住。能做到這個程度，我國的經濟，我國的政治，我國的社會才有堅牢的根基。靑年朋友們，無論我們願意做實際的或理論的工作。在科學裏，從數學到生物學，有無數的有趣的重要問題等待我們去解決。愛好科學的靑年朋友們，我們爲了建國，必須使科學深入鄉村，深入邊疆，把科學的種子，撒播於窮鄉僻壤，廣大邊疆，撒播於四萬萬七千萬同胞的眼裏心底，使自東北的黑龍江畔起，至西南的喜馬拉雅山麓止，以及整個中國社會的經濟，政治裏頭，都滿佈着科學的稱子，茁長起科學的新芽，開放出科學的鮮花，結下來科學的碩果。愛好科學的靑年朋友們，一致動員起來，致力科學的研究，從事科學的建設，建設起科學化的現代新中國。</p>
<p>培養民主精神</p>
<p>第四，我們要做一個建國青年，須有民主的修養。民主的重要意義，是要奉公守法，就是要服從多數人的公意，和遵守國家社會的法紀。我國一般人民對於民主的修養，可以說是非常的缺乏。所以一切事情，往往不能服從公意，遵守法紀，以致整個國家社會，紛亂不堪言狀。我們當這實施憲政的前夕，自然要奔向民主的大路，注意民主的修養。靑年學生，是人民的先鋒，是民族的菁英，故其一言一動，都應該做一般民衆的表率，尤其要注意民主的修養，領導一般民衆，奔向民主憲政的坦途。靑年學生們，能够這樣去做的固然很多，但缺乏民主的修養，假民主自由的美名，做犯法亂紀的事情的亦不少。最近各地靑年學生，因細故而鬧風潮，打報館商店，甚至因而以罷課爲要挾的武器的，亦時有所聞。這完全是與民主背道而馳的。因爲民主是服從公意，遵重輿論的；報紙原是做人民喉舌，爲人民說話的，怎樣可以打毁報館呢？這不是毀滅與論，背叛民主的蠻横行爲嗎？至於校內的發生細故，儘可以訴之於法律，斷之以公意公理，爲什麼偏要鼓動風潮，基至於罷課，靑年學生，以求學爲天職，家長和國家社會，都以此期待着，望其學業成功，造福國家社會，所以不惜每年化費鉅大的經費，來辦理學校，今竟以細故而罷課，這不是自欺欺人，自誤誤國，廢棄自己的學業，毁滅國家的前途嗎？靑年學生們，爲愛護你們的學業，珍念國家的前途，切不可再有罷課之類的自殺行爲。相反的，你們要用合法的手續，公意的表現，輿論的制裁：在消極方面，剷除校內喜歡興波作浪的犯法亂紀的害羣之馬；在積極方面，組織各種學信研究會，並且奉公守法的從事各種團體的活動，來培養民主的精神，促進民主的修養，再進而指導民衆，實踐地方自治，準備實施憲政，建設起民主憲政的新中國。</p>
<p>靑年朋友們，我們生逢這個建國與邦的千載一時的偉大時代，應該負起這個建國的時代使命，鍜煉起強健的體格，修養成高尙的人格，訓練好科學的知能，具備着民主的修養，然後本着「己立立人，己達達人」的精神，建設起富强民主的現代新中華民國。（三六，五，四，寫於上海。）</p>

<h3>輸出推廣執委會討論　進出口連鎖制度</h3>
<p>由輸出輸入兩會推舉代表研究　擬具意見呈送全國經委會參考</p>

<h3>米船遭扣留來貨稀少　糧商請市長保護　白粳門售超三十萬元大關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕搶米風潮由杭州蔓延至無錫，米商深恐運米被搶，遂多裹足不前。而本市米商前往產區運米，沿途地方政府亦頗多留難，日前即有來滬米船十艘被扣於靑浦黄渡之間。</p>
<p>本市米商因扣米之舉影響採運及全市整個民食問題，乃於昨晨推派瞿振華，查寳三，及徐頌仁晋謁吳市長，請市長設法解決此點困難。吳市長當應允即電請警備司令部派員對產區運米商加以保護，並分請各地當局勿予留難。被扣之十艘米船則電請放行。</p>
<p>白粳白元創新紀錄</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市塲到貨仍稀，共六六八·六石。因市塲已恢復自由買賣，河下貨亦加入交易，故實際成交在五千石以上。白粳喊價常帮爲二十七萬元，錫帮則爲三十萬元。白元做卅一萬元。門售尙逾此數，均創新紀錄。</p>
<p>社會局昨仍拋白粳九千包，南市塲承銷四千五百包，北市塲僅購四千三百二十包，另有一百八十包無人承購。各米號前因配米少而排隊欲購之市民多，每易引起糾紛，故多不敢登記。現各米號擬將每區之配米集中一處出售，而由各米號派員共同協助辦理。</p>
<p>工人學生將施配米</p>
<p>近來本市米價飛漲，且不易購買，社會局為安定民食，聞已擬定臨時緊急辦法，將實施配米。據記者探悉，該項辦法規定對工廠工人公私立大學學生中等學校學生，由各工廠及學校當局造具名册，及國民身份證號碼送局核配，每人每月配米二斗。又貧民區域將由該局會同各區警局及區公所，組設貧民食米公賣處。各區貧民可持戶篇證連同該戶所有身份證，向公賣處購米，聞該項臨時緊急辦法，正呈請中央核定，預計短期內即可實行云。</p>
<p>大批洋米日內可到</p>
<p>中信局訂購之洋米，續有運到，五日由海厦輪運到暹米二千噸，又暹米六千八百噸，三日已由仰光重興輪裝出，日內可到。</p>
<h3>麵粉雜糧上漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油價格昨先升後跌，結果各檔收盤價皆較前日回小一萬元左右。本廠豆油五十九萬元，通桶熟菜油五十七萬五千元，簍生油五十七萬元，小車蔴油六十萬元，吉桶生油六十一萬五千元。</p>
<p>麵粉雜糧豆餅價格昨日均挺。洋粉做十六萬元，午粉十一萬元，麩皮八萬三千五百元，漲起一萬元左右。大連元豆十九萬元，大連靑豆十八萬八千元，平湖杜豆二十三萬五千元，崇明沙黄責十八萬五千元。</p>
<p>各檔生仁漲起一萬至二萬元不等。秦皇島生仁三十四萬五千元，九江生仁三十二萬元，開封生仁三十三萬元，靑島生仁三十六萬元，營口生仁三十五萬五千元</p>
<p>豆餅亦各昇數千元。甡記豆餅六萬元，仁記豆餅六萬另五百元，元隆豆餅六萬元，利字豆餅六萬一千元，建字豆餅五萬九千五百元，餘記豆餅六萬二千元，營豆餅九萬八千元。</p>
<h3>議價無結果今日再會談</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）食油及麵粉兩議價小組會，曾分於前昨兩日下午，在市社會局召開會議，到兩業有關各方面人士，討論後迄未獲得結果。</p>
<p>緣聞廠方提出之生產成本，係採上海之原料成本計算。故算出之成本，尙在目前黑市價格之上。本廠荳油，以大連大豆每祖十八萬五千元計算，廠方所提出之荳油生產成本，每担爲七十七萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉以小麥每担十七萬元計算，廠方所提出之本粉生產成本，每包爲十一萬三千九百元，均較目前黑市償格爲高。故社局着各商重行硏究抑低成本之方。聞麵粉業方面人士已定於今日會談，俾便提供麵粉最低可能生產之成本云。</p>
<h3>農行舉辦茶貸　根據三項原則</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行舉辦之茶葉貸款，茶商咸認限制過嚴，請求放寬。據該行負責人談稱：此次舉辦茶貸，根據三種原則。一，導游資入生產，二，减低成本，三，加高生產速率。預計本年度茶葉總產量約在五十萬担至六十萬担之間。但迄目前止，已向該行請求貸款之茶商茶廠，有一千六百餘單位。總計其產量竟有一百五十萬担之多。其中恐有不實。故該行規定凡綠茶能產三百担之茶商，及紅茶能產一百担之茶商，始可申請貸款。又爲顧及生產速率，由各該商先以成本購買毛茶商，然後再由該行貸予茶貸，作改裝及運銷之用。凡產量少之茶，可合併請求貸款，對不足產量之茶商，則一概不貸。目前開始貸出者僅祁門一地，其他尙在審核產量中云。</p>
<h3>遞交將增特證　華股漲勢微挫　尙有少數漲停板</h3>
<p>華股昨稍後突有反動，傳下期遞交有增收特證三成之說，市氣漸有裂痕。惟中絲新亞仍在環境推助下，屹立於漲停，尙多買戶。</p>
<p>晨初　開出，美亞五和漲停，餘股榮辱互見，遞永紗開後，二二四號九一號一八八號一九七號一二九號二三一號六五號均進，中絲商務水泥又均漲達限度，永紗乃漲達六九〇〇元。二〇七號二二三號一二九號九四號賣出，退爲六八五〇元。九一號一八〇號一四九號一八四號一二九號一四五號二一九號九七號二八號進胃不弱，升爲六九七〇元。新亞亦吿漲停，二三一號一五三號一五五號四號二三二號二三號逢高了結，降爲六八三〇元。入後轉呈徘徊，十時四十分後，外股突俏，一四五號二一九號一〇五號一六號一八〇號一一七號一五三號一二號一九九號二一九號七六號六二号連袂購買，散空亦補，遞永紗漲到七一〇〇元。一四五號一五三號一八三號九四號六〇號八九號二一三號一六二號脫乎，退爲六七二〇元。良以增收特證三成之訊突傳也。此後形勢混亂，九一號二二二號買進，九四號三六號二〇七號則賣，午刻在六八八〇〇元內外，大事掙扎，惟收後一八五號等有補，喊價升至六九二〇元以上，塲外報高，即交倒掛。結果較前收計永紗升半成，美亞升一成弱，信和勤興永公微升，華豐平平，新光景福新華微挫。遞交計美亞升一成弱，勤興平平，新光永公稍降，永紗信和華豐景福微升。冷股計新亞五和中絲商務漲停，水泥榮豐漲停後有回，升一成不到，景綸中紡跌半成，火柴大通小聞，餘均微降。</p>
<p>午後　因聞港申電續縮，人心復好，二一五號一九六號俱有微納，中絲美亞商務新亞仍吿漲停，遞永紗見七〇六元高價後，即吿下游。四九號一五二號九七號一七九號一八三號一五三號四號四七號紛售，退至六八五〇元。二二四號一九九號一〇〇號進至六九五〇元左右。二二三號一六〇號二號二二號一四五號七七號二一三號八九號一六〇號一五四號八五號一〇五號三一號儿四號一五三號了結，供過於求，退爲六五四〇元。七七號一七三號九七號几五號二一五號趁低有納，臨收回穩，收後喊價升至六七〇〇元外。結果較前收計永紗午後未獲成交，信和微升，華　微降，新光永公景福勤興各跌半成强，新華跌一成，美亞漲停。遞交計永紗信和景福微降，華豐永公新光景福勤與各跌半成，奚亞漲停後有回，尙升半成。冷股中絲新亞商務漲停，中紡榮豐統益大通景綸各跌一成，餘股榮辱不一，塲外各設再升一成。</p>

<p>（五）原匯票在滬到期，倘有拒付情事，應由原申請行莊負責償還。</p>
<p>（六）本辦法經陳奉核准後施行，修正時亦同。</p>
<h3>外股疲落</h3>
<p>外股昨高後急回，證劵　脫手，午後更爲不支。怡紗晨開九〇〇〇〇元；港匯步俏，廣幫有納，高價達九三五〇〇元，英聯達一五〇〇〇〇外，始吿回瀉。午後更見怯疲，慘跌至八〇〇〇〇元內，鋼業等小股更爲不利，結果較前收計鋼業航業各跌一成强，英聯紙業電話墾植開平各跌半成，餘均微降。</p>
<h3>統債轉跌</h3>
<p>公債昨稍疲落，統丙晨開二〇〇〇〇元，高價二〇三〇〇元。五〇三室雖有補進，五五二室及散戶俱書，而退至一七八〇〇元。成交約一千萬。結果較前收計甲乙降三百元，丙跌一千元，統丁降四百元，統戊亦小五百元。</p>
<h3>美金公債基金　已撥交保管會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：政府業已將美金公債部份之基金本利，約合外匯基金五千五百餘萬元，行文撥交新債劵基金保管委員會保管。至短期庫劵部份之基金本利，因尚待指定之國營事業及敵僞產業等處理就緒後，方能撥交保管云。</p>
<p>又悉：該基金保管委員會定於今日下午四時，在銀行公會大廈舉行第三次會議，主要議題，爲討論該會內部之辦事細則云。</p>
<h3>王龍生湘鄂歸來談　桐油出口之危機</h3>
<p>走私猖獗香港存貨充斥</p>
<p>經濟部中國植物油料廠，爲謀取桐油產量增加，及擴充儲煉設備，曾於兩週前，由該廠經理王龍生，親赴湘鄂等地考察。茲悉王氏已公舉返滬，據談此行經過稱，値此海外桐油價格低落之秋，吾人除積極加緊生產外，如提高品質，减輕成本，加强煉儲設備，均為當前急務。試觀湘鄂等地桐油客商儲藏設備問題，最感困難。本人此行任務，一方使太廠煉油產量增加，一方代客商服務，使產地之貨，用油管輸入輪船，使貯藏者，用鐵聽裝置，以節省人力，减少消耗爲主。經過十餘日之籌劃，最近期內，可獲實現。對本廠煉油部份，漢口廠可每月煉製一千五百噸，儲藏設備爲五千噸。長沙常德，可煉兩千噸，儲藏一千五百噸。宜昌煉儲各爲一千噸。商人得有完善儲藏設備，雖一時海外市價不景氣，亦可稍存觀望，待價而沽。王氏認爲漢口桐油市價平穩，存貨並不過缺乏，如須大量採購，亦無問題。又走私現已不易，輸管會在華南之設施，頗著成效。湖南全省，戰前年產桐油三萬五千噸，經戰時兵變，產量减少，現約二萬噸。迄今運出者，據估計約五千噸。另有內銷秀油，洪油，亦約五千噸。其餘數量，均走私至香港，套取黑市外匯。其路綫分長沙常德兩途，其實際走私數量，刻無從估計。但正當商人，由長沙運油運港，包括運費結果所得，結匯重返原地購貨，其補充量，須折百分之四十。反之，走私商人，其利益則倍之。因之湘桂路上走私猖獗，香港存貨充斥，造成互相傾軋狀態。紛紛跌價，外商脅於價格不穩，胃納呆滯，此均桐油市塲內在危機。至外在原因，據悉：三月份以後統計，美國由華輸入存油，約共兩萬噸。美國戰前，桐油生產量，年僅約七千噸，現對植桐榨油，加速改良，可增至一萬噸。其成本不及每磅兩角美元。又如新發明用硬性篦蔴油代替品，其成本亦僅兩角五美元，足爲我國外銷桐油勁敵云。</p>
<h3>內銷茶大活躍　價比前漲二三成</h3>
<p>岑靜多時之各種內銷茶，昨日市上，因津帮突然搜吸，致過程大有死灰復燃之局面。價格方面，初尙平定，迨後竟若燎原野火，一發不可收拾。結果卅五年度上徽烘每祖由卅五萬元一路翱翔至四十二三萬元。同時花大方，每祖跳叩八十萬元左右。他若珠蘭茶每担躍登百萬高峯，比前均漲起二三成不等，脚地俱亟鞏固，其他花色，咸僅零星去化，形勢膠着不變。洋莊茶市，因買戶胃納狹隘，抑且雙方談判僵持，故交易依然難振行情虛浮非凡。茲悉：刻下歐地需茶頗殷，終以價格關係，一時難以順利輸出，而聞本市新華茶葉公司國外莊口，即將派員來滬，視察茶市實際情形，以利日後華茶外銷云。</p>
<h3>三月份行莊存放款統計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據央行統計：三月份全國金融機構之資產總額爲一，六〇八，三五四，九二三，二四一元。其中華商銀行一七三家，佔百分之廿五·七九。外商銀行十三家，佔分之三三·九九。錢莊三十二家，佔一一·五六。信託公司十三家，佔百分之一。六六。存款總額爲五九五，七九五，九五二，一三八元，其中華商銀行佔百分之六九·四九。外商銀行佔百分之八·九三。錢莊佔百分之十八一三九。信託公司佔二·八九。放款總額爲四六八，七六四，六二五，四六四元。其中華商銀行佔百分之五七·一三，外商銀行佔百分之二二·〇一，錢莊佔一八·三一，信託公司佔二·五五云。</p>
<h3>公教人員配布　本月半可望發售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司配發公教人員夏季布匹，爲黄卡其漂白布兩積，早經着手準備，現已就緒。上海方面，原定本月五日在金陵路五二五號該公司第二門市部開始。茲以公敎人員配售物品審核委員會決定此項配布，以肆月份各公敎機關之人員名額爲準。此項名册，正趕編中。紡建公司爲便利領布機關及避免過分擁擠計，擬俟接到名册後，即分函各機關按排定日期，彙集其所應繳之布款，携備公函，至門市部交款提布，大約本月月半，可望開市發售云。</p>
<h3>閩省擬與東北　辦理物物交換</h3>

<h3>新華銀行新廈落成</h3>
<p>本市新華信託儲蓄銀行，因業務擴張，原有行址不敷應用。乃價購江西路九江路轉角前沙遜大　房屋全部，作爲總行行址。現已修葺完工，定於五月十二日遷移新址營業云。</p>
<h3>食糖市況轉疲</h3>
<p>昨糖市因台公司復配之說可望實現，故趨勢轉軟。秘魯細砂初爲四十二萬元，旋至二萬五千元，終回至一萬九千元，小萬餘元。二四粗白無更動，二〇中砂小萬五千元，車白上落無幾，汕靑因售出無多，尙持原價。刁靑廿五萬元至廿四萬六千元，小四五千元，成交三百數十包。興化白四十一萬元至卅九萬五千元，興赤小五千元，爲卅萬〇五千元至廿九萬元。</p>
<h3>菸業再騰</h3>
<p>菸業以來路阻塞，市貨甚少，本年激漲甚力，最近漲勢尤甚。靑州中等貨葉子每磅喊一萬五千元，許州一萬四千元，鳳陽，新昌，四都葉子，亦齊步飛升。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據昨日杭州來烟客談：四都菸葉產地貨已甚少，滬商前往搜購者，絡繹不絕，每件一一二磅，散片已漲至八十萬元。</p>
<h3>五金步漲</h3>
<p>五金在一月以來，以受黑市外匯上升之刺激，幾無日不漲，近日漲勢更銳，人心之堅，得未曾有。昨人頭砂布。紫銅管，白鐵管，漲風最厲。洋釘亦漲一成左右。</p>

<h3>賽恩河上春色無邊　巴黎街頭風景線</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>四月廿五日巴黎航訊</p>
<p>多維爾海峽短短二十五英里，把歐洲兩　並肩的大國，　成了兩個天地，這一水之隔，不僅劃分了兩個國家絕不相同的民族性，而且也劃分了絕不相同的天時和地利。暮春在月的天氣，在倫敦還是濃霧重重，難得看見大太陽。但是，在巴黎，已經是望不盡的無邊春色。</p>
<p>到過巴黎的人，沒有不懷念這世界花都的。凱旋門的雄偉，平坦，整齊，錄蔭隔道的馬路，賽恩河上的錄楊垂柳，康吿特廣塲的空嚝寬暢，秀麗的鐵塔，乃至於古色古香的拉丁區風味，都給人一個不會泯滅的印象。法國人愛美，愛藝術，愛生活情趣的欣賞。因此，一百多來琢磨成功的巴黎，也見美的，藝術的，處處可以令人欣賞的都市。如果說：倫敦，上海，和紐約，是屬於同一類型的都布，那麽，巴黎，北平，蘇杭，該屬於相反的一類。前者給人的印象，是忙，是亂，是緊張，是煩　。人們的活動，是爲了爭錢，爭地位，爭名譽。後者却給久一種安　，一種解脫，一種超越的想像，人們生活在這一個境界中，慢慢地體騐，咀嚼生活的情趣，從而導求眞正的美。</p>
<p>一重公案　法國姑娘話貝當</p>
<p>我並非玄妙地誇耀巴黎。兩年前，我曾經在巴黎逗留過一個時候，那是巴黎光復後不久，一切都是亂糟糟的。法國人三星期丢了「馬奇諾」，又加上四年被征服的慘痛，陰黯，失望，灰心，籠單住法國人的胸懷和心境。他們成羣的站立在國立歌劇院門前，眼睜睜看着年輕的日耳曼小伙子出去了，生氣蓬勃大呼大鬧的美國孩子進來了。戴高樂回到了巴黎，貝當被放逐了，賴伐爾上了斷頭台。大多數的法國人，對於那一幕接一幕的悲劇，那時候確乎感覺麻木。一直到我這次來巴黎，有回巴黎姑娘和我在黄昏的賽恩河上散步。她說：，法國人祇何衝動，沒有理智，法國人腦筋中的「革命」，是一陣風一樣的短期的情感的激動。從來就沒有統盤計劃過一件事。她還說：侮辱老貝當，是法國人泯滅了良心的舉措。她那時候在巴黎，她知道老貝當的苦心。</p>
<p>巴黎變了　與兩年前大不同</p>
<p>對於這段公案的是非，也許更有複雜的內幕。但無論如何，我這次來巴黎，覺得和兩年前有了絕大的改變。第一，經濟的繁榮，雖然沒有做到十二分理想，但因爲法國有工業基礎，復員建設的速度，是無可抺殺的。兩年前，我出入於凱旋門大街，曼德琳大街，乃至於「孟碼頭」一帶的商業區，玻璃廚窗內看不見商品，飯館裏沒有魚肉，沒有是够的麵包，旅館洗澡沒有熱水，馬路上難得看見幾輛車子。這回來，玻璃窗裏，有了呢絨綢緞，有了眞正皮革做成的皮鞋，（註：兩年前，法國人穿木製皮鞋）。餐館吃飯，只要付黑市售價，應有盡有。旅館的規模，已經恢復到戰前的水準。格蘭特旅館，巴黎飯店，都是外國進來的國際商人盤據着，將近一千法郞一天的房價，每天都高掛着「客滿」，香舍麗寨附近的「喬治第五」大飯店，從前美國司令部徵用的，現在交還給了原主，是巴黎天字第一號的大旅館，現在大部份是各國的外交官住着，房金都收到一千法郞以上。從前盟軍總部徵調，作爲戰地記者大本營的「斯可白」飯店，現在偶而還可以君見一二個戎裝的盟軍官長，出入其間，大部份旅客，都是來往於美法之間的商人。只要顧客們捨得化錢，旅館的供應什麼都有。</p>
<p>公用街車　數達八千輛之多</p>
<p>闊別一年多，巴黎的面目，確乎有了大改變。滿街的水輛，是兩年前所絕對夢想不到的。公共汽車多半已經恢復，黄錄色的車廂，每班都是擠得滿滿的。「公用街車」現在已經有八千輛之多，在巴黎街頭揮手科「街車」，似乎比倫敦更方便。我到巴黎的第五天，忽然所有街車都罷工，原因據說是爲了政府减少配給汽油，黑市汽油價錢太貴。大槪政府後來讓了步，所以第二天，八千輛街車，又生氣蓬勃的出現在市上。</p>
<p>地道車輛　每條綫均呈弧形</p>
<p>貫穿巴黎市區最重要的交通工具，應該算是「地道車」了。我跑了這麼些地方，對巴黎的地道車最爲欣賞。紐約的太　，一看見地道車，腦殼就發脹。車廂是黑漆漆的，坐位一點沒有舒適之感，驛台內外，鐵軌兩旁，全是遍地的菓殼報紙，乃至於橡皮糖的包反。我在紐約的時候，常常想起美國人可以有力量打敗德國和日本，但誰都沒有方法，來淸掃紐約的地道車。許多人讚美倫敦的地下車，乾乾凈凈，有條有理，坐位舒適，而且深度大，戰時可以用來躱避空襲。但是我仍然覺得巴黎的更好，巴黎的制度好，每條綫全是弧形的，從任何一個地道車的洞口，踏進地洞，你便永遠不會迷失路途，按圖索驥，最多祗要換一次車，便可以到達你的目的地。有人說：莫斯科的地道車有如「藝術之宮」，我沒有到過莫斯科，不敢隨便批評。</p>
<p>借來外匯　一年前用去大半</p>
<p>這回來巴黎，地道車還和往常一樣擁擠。票價從兩法郞漲到四法郎一次，並且取消了頭等二等的差別。兩年前封閉了的十多個出口，現在經過修理，又重新開放了。我到巴黎的時候，正是戴高樂演講以後不久，法國的政潮，正在急激醞釀，我看見地道車的墻上，貼着很多政治性的標語。</p>
<p>我預備在下一篇通訊中，詳細報導法國政潮的內幕。法國目前的政治生活，和經濟生活，都在一個畸形的變態中發展。從美國借來的外匯，一年之間，又已用去了大半，而海關進口數字，主要項目，是糧食和香烟。法國現在仍然對馬達加斯加島和越南用兵，北非洲隨時有小規模的騷動，海外駐軍三四十萬人，再加上佔領德國的軍事用費，政府的財政預算，依然走在崩潰的路上。</p>
<p>商店門窗一律貼九折標語</p>
<p>但是，在巴黎，道些現象都隱伏在安定與繁榮的幕後。社會黨執政以來，大吹大擂的做了幾件事情：第一是各商店，旅館，餐廳，理髮店，成衣舖，等等，一律厲行「减價百分之十運動」，各家商店的門上，都貼着印就的標語：「减價百分之十」。法國人聰明，法國商人更聽明，他們一方面厲行法令，一方面先把物價提高百分之十，然後再减價百分之十售出。大部份都這樣做了。但是聰明的苜相尼拉馬第亞，比那些商人們更聰明，有一次，他對一位法國記者說：「這就好了，我原來的目的，並不希求他們减價，而是期望他們不漲價。减價雖沒成，但　的目的，算是達成了」！</p>
<p>第二條傑作　沒收國難商財產</p>
<p>社會黨對經濟措施的第二件傑作，是沒收國難商人的財產。每天，社會黨政府的機關報「民衆報」上，常常披露「例如」的消息：一個羅馬尼亞「拾荒」的靑年，五六年前漂流到法國，那時候，正是維琪政府屈降的時候，這位羅馮尼亞靑年，因爲和德國人勾結，竟發了法國的「國難財」，變成千萬巨富。戰事結束以後，他運用他的資金，仍舊操縱巴黎的黑市。「現在經內政部警察總署査巡，財產全部沒收」。例如這標傳奇性的故事，幾乎每天都有。國務總理拉馬第亞最近的演說中，常常此較他的前任政府和現任政府，他說：社會黨政府，有能力鎭服法國的經濟危機，要人民鎭定，安靜和動奮工作。</p>
<p>美鈔暴跌　異國遊客大吃虧</p>
<p>然而，拉馬第亞的傑作還不在此。他最得意的是：最近美金價格的暴跌，從最高黑市價格三百七十五法郞比一，到現在一百九十比一。社會黨政府說：這表示法國經濟的安定，表示法郎幣制的穩定。但是，內行人都不以爲然。巴黎的物價沒有跌，跌了的是外幣，因此，倒霉的是外國的遊客。這幾天，法國報紙都在紛紛研究美鈔跌價的原因，說來話長，道理很複雜。內中近因之一，是法國國家銀行拋售存放於瑞士的黄金，吸收了相當大數目的市塲游資。</p>
<p>這些畸形的經濟變態，倒有些跟中國相像。我離開上海十年，也許，上海今天的「繁榮」和紙辭金迷，和巴黎可以東西　美。倫敦「每日郵報」的大陸版，有一天寫得很刻薄，它說；英國人打了勝仗，法國人沒有打仗，如今仗打完了，英國人縛要　　人間少見的「苦」，法國人事人間未有的「福」，這焉能讀爲公平？</p>
<p>享樂是法國人的天性，沒有快樂，便沒有生活的美，沒有美，人活着，無異死去。因此，今朝有酒今朝醉，便成了法國民間，特別是巴黎民間的共同人生觀。不是嗎？凱旋門大街連接着的舞廳，畢伽爾一帶的形形色色的夜總會，袒裸的女人的胸脯，赤條條的女人的大腿，再加上靡靡的肉麻的音樂。酒，脂粉，香水的濃烈的氣氛，再加上不自然的女人的在笑，揉成一片。</p>
<p>冬天是巴黎陰雨蟄伏的季節，春來了，塞恩河上百花競放。在紐約一年，聽不見鳥語，嗅不到花香。一到巴黎，看到遍地的錄色，緊束着的胸襟，像獲得了解放。今早上，我呌了一輛街車，從拉了區的河邊出發，沿着賽恩河兩岸「兜風」，綠色的河水，倒映着岸邊的綠蔭，微微抖動，賽恩河上幾十幢花崗石的「弓橋」，映着煦和的朝陽，點綴着這世界花都的無邊春色。</p>
<h3>台灣中南部四日行</h3>
<p>— 本報特約員江暮雲</p>
<p>台灣的光復，是一件劃時代的大事；台灣的二，二八，又可說是光復後的一件並不小的大事。現在回憶起來，流血的二，二八，該是個恐怖的日子；人們都感到過去一年半來的擾嚷和狹義的排外行動，在熱望到失望，失望到怨望的情緒轉變中，可能發生反響，但以一般人們所直感的，決沒有事實那樣波及範圍之大，流血之多。尤其是中南部的台中，嘉義，高雄閙得最兇，情形最糟，而時間也最長。</p>
<p>記者以一百小時的短時間，在這二，二八的三個放血口，作了一次腹地的動亂後首次的巡禮。</p>
<p>刦後餘生　滿是驚險故事</p>
<p>記者們於上月二十九日搭早快車離台北，過去有可能地買二等票坐舒適的座位，可是現在不可能了，買了頭等票，仍坐不到位，白天列車的　次减少了，入晚軍事管制，不能通行，於是把全部旅客擠縮在白天的幾班車裏。</p>
<p>當記者訪問地方首長，彼此見面時，大家都互慶刧後餘生。而當各個人講述他在事變時的經歷時，又像聽着不同的驚險故事。故事裏有血有淚，顯然地，地方首長的能未遭意外的，還憑倚着平時的作爲，更要的還在於他們能堅持自我的崗位，忍苦的發揮愛民族國家的正義感。</p>
<p>高雄市長黄仲閣是半山（省胞諷外省人爲阿山，稱內地來的省胞是半山，省女嫁外省人爲靠山，謂之三山），仍免不了要接受暴徒威脅恐嚇的禮物，他在領導參議員們七人到要塞司令部拜訪彭司令孟緝時，其中的暴徒竟身懷短槍，企圖行刺，這一幕是可怕的。嘉義市長孫志俊在動亂中撤退到飛機塲後，仍冒萬險和暴徒們談判，機智幫助了他脫離虎口，泉州人台中市長黄克立通閩南話，但在如此動亂中，阿山的閩語是失了效用的，他還需要能講日語，暴徒們是忘情不了日本。他是從霧峯逃回市區，又被「集中」起來，飽受驚險和威迫，台共們要他的法寳：官方的密電碼。</p>
<p>一種試鍊　苦難中大教訓</p>
<p>這次，不論對官民都是一個敎訓，而對軍警憲更是一種試鍊。</p>
<p>高雄要塞司令部的王潔參謀長追述當時應付的情形是煞費苦心的，爲民衆的安全，治安的維持，生命和港灣的保護他不能不戰，但爲了服從層峯不能輕舉妄動的命令又不能戰，民絕不能戰，戰乎，不戰乎，這是個最堪躊躇的難題。</p>
<p>嘉義憲兵區隊長李士榮，率領所有十八位同志，槍聲緊迫中護送公敎人員撤退後再進入市區，終又在飛機塲激戰，暴徒們書面和電話裏要挾他要繳械，否則「十二萬市民每個人可以用一根竹桿」殺完外省人，爲了實力的單薄，槍械可要繳，但爲了保持軍人正氣，又絕不能貿然投降，於是繳乎，不繳乎，使他煞費苦心</p>
<p>地方當局在「權宜處理」的情形下，審愼地堅持地善處理緊急事件，確屬是一種試鍊。暴徒之來，像一陣暴雨，官方和民間都失了控制力，行政官吏能指揮的警察們百分之八十是本省籍，他們都臨陣棄職了。一種沒有實力的軍事刺激，更徒增暴徒的氣燄。在苦難中，我們看到了好歹民衆的分野，也看到了軍人不可屈的凛然抗拒精神，而公敎人員的手無寸鐵，其情形更是可憫的。</p>
<p>這中南部的三大都市，時聞持續得最久的是嘉義，情彩也最慘烈，參加者有二萬人，記者們在踏査市區的「戰地」時，還可以看到壕溝和彈痕。</p>
<p>我們所最關心的是死傷數字，各該地方政府所提出的統計是：</p>
<p>嘉義：外省人（公教人員）</p>
<p>死一一人</p>
<p>傷五一人</p>
<p>輕傷未計入</p>
<p>本省人</p>
<p>死四〇六人</p>
<p>傷一三一人</p>
<p>失踪九人</p>
<p>高雄：死傷官兵（守倉庫）三一人</p>
<p>明正典　一四人</p>
<p>違犯軍紀士兵二人</p>
<p>台中：外省人</p>
<p>伤五〇人</p>
<p>死五人</p>
<p>本省人</p>
<p>死二人</p>
<p>以上還不過是一個初步調査數字，以嘉義而論，據記者所知，實際上不止此數。</p>
<p>善良省胞　仍是可敬可愛</p>
<p>此次事件，有一個共通點是，暴徒都來是台北，他們分乘卡車到各地煽動，勾結當地的地痞，流氓，利用靑年學生，政治野心家便乘機活動，到最後階段少數的共產黨參加進去。在各地都成立了「參謀本部」或「作戰本部」，下面分設若干隊，若干組。而且都提出了「條件」，散發日文傳單，日本式的軍事配備。刀棒之外，還有輕重機關槍，甚至還有小鋼砲，他們有不同的目標，流氓企圖繳槍做資本，野心家要利用時機過官癮，共產黨參加離間，搗亂，在不同目標下便表現了錯綜複雜幼稚可憐的爭奪戰和排外行動。</p>
<p>流氓大部自內地和海外撤退歸來的，一部是火燒島釋放的，他們之中總數十多萬人，其中儘多的是軍人，政治野心家都是「星民會」人物，因爲政府寬大，他們在光復後又成了民間的「紅人」，而兆產黨怕也不是屬於中共，日共之流，即是稱爲「台共」的這些份子，在大部善良的民衆之中，借着「緝私」的事端而導演着一幕空前的流血慘劇。</p>
<p>從叧一個角度來看，善良的省胞，仍是可愛可敬的民族。</p>
<p>在此次事變中，目擊耳觸，許多安分守己的省胞，農·工階層始終沒有參加，而且他們還保護了他作爲自己的事業底場所，若干更奮不顧身的救護外省人。台中虎尾有一個老人家藏匿了外省籍排長，竟被割去了耳朵，到現在還在醫院要。</p>
<p>血的裂痕　需要趕緊彌補</p>
<p>二·二八它寫下了本外省人之間血的裂痕底紀錄。目前正是綏靖淸鄕時期，黨政軍配合着調查戶口，收繳槍械，這將是事變的尾聲在此一時期中，民衆們都一致希望政府寬大爲　除主犯者外，從犯不必深究，而且希望公開審判，明正典　，這已給白部長現了，堪注意的是公激人員的一片保障聲，正在四起，他們抱着滿腔熱誠飄洋渡海爲這塊新生的島省工作，結果待遇旣交國內爲低不能溫飽，而又獲致出人意料之外的「報　」，這種怨聲，）正渴待警本外省人感情的彌補。</p>
<p>我們絕不能忽略促成流血事件的最要因素：日本思想文化的廻光反照。而人民因物價高漲致生活不安定，直覺的打動着每個人的心絃。自然，思想文化的再看輸和再敎育，必須使省胞　潛移默化地擴展其視野和胸襟，發揮其祖國愛的！</p>
<p>血的裂痕，需要用迅捷而妥善的方法，彌補起來，新生的力量將較以前是更堅實的，希望二，二八是口灣的新的轉捩點。</p>

<h3>本市道路建設芻議</h3>
<p>邇來本市各處馬路已在逐漸修理，而天目路且在大事改造，鄙人樂觀市政之建設，情緒非常興奮，今就管見所及，謹建議數點，披露於本欄，以爲我市政當局參考焉，（一）開闢跑馬廳貫通東西南北必要道路，以調濟中區交通。（二）溝通東區直達新閘區與滬西區之道路，使勿經蘇州河南之中區道路，（甲）將北浙江路之天潼路與阿拉白司脫路接通（中間祗有一養塚地隔離）再與庫倫路接通，即可至新閘橋，而新閘橋必須重建以便車輛通過，則東區車輛可循此路直達新閘區（乙）將新民路放寬截直直達恒豐路橋畔，則東區與北區車輛可循此路直達滬西矣。（三）按目前交通情形，滬市道路必須保持同時能容納電車汽車與各種速度較慢車輛並行之寬度，庶不致擁擠不通動輙衝撞，是以滬市各主要交通綫似宜逐漸與以放寬而計劃中新闢道路與市中心區閘北區滬西區滬南區尤宜預將寬度放大，以應滬市將來發展之需，而快車道與慢車道似不宜劃分隔離，因隔離了似乎反不便與不經濟也，此可在中正路見之。（四）現有道路旁房屋已讓進者或已毁於戰火者應即放寬之，不可讓棚戶或准棧木柵之類再侵佔路面，或在人行道上面搭蓋蘆柵堆積雜物，妨礙交通。（五）市中道路人行道旁常見有很多大小石塊，石屑，水泥塊柏油路塊，或泥土汚泥堆積，似宜由工務當局分別與以收集堆放於空曠之處，儲為他處之用，蓋舊料不無可用之處，亦所以節省物資以補建設經費之不足，亦所以使道路整潔，以利交通以重觀瞻也。（六）市中各道路修理後每見有石塊碎石石屑遺漏在路旁，日久常與垃圾爲任，而所修碎石路常不堅不實，無多日即浮鬆高低不平，此非爲减料而度喻工也，因料固有餘而棄置路旁也此不免爲浪費工料，而使市民有市政不良之感覺，我工務當局宜嚴加督察，勿使浪費人力與物力，（七）市中各處道路旁常有很多垃圾或汚泥堆積，或水溝不通積水不退，在早晨又有糞車將糞汁滲漏路上，誠有糞垢浪藉之感，想我世界大都市之一大上海實愧對我一較整潔之小都市也，且今夏令將屆本市不是在宣傳防疫嗎，竊思在垃圾堆中打防疫針不如先淸除垃圾糞垢爲愈祈我衛生當局勿徒自宣傳，尙應努力實際工作爲要，蓋欲談衛生，環境淸潔實爲最初去條件乎。（八）爲淸除本市垃圾及多餘碎石泥磚起見，最好由工務局築一自浦東循公路至川沙東海濱，有一沙灘斜出於海內，與海岸略平行之臨時過路，一方面在浦江中建備二艘汽車輸渡，可載運汽　　車過江，衛生局即利用此項建設運垃圾及沙土磚石等至海濱即逐漸堆積於沙灘上，日積月纍，或能形成一狹長之防波堤，而堤內可能形成一小海港以為帆船或漁船停泊之所，以本市垃圾量之大，且向爲市政當局難以處置問題之一，余之建議或能有且於此一問題之解決乎？</p>
<h3>神鷹部隊兩軍長　儒將孫立人　硬將潘裕昆</h3>
<p>— 本報記者趙展</p>
<p>長春一日航訊</p>
<p>在多事的東北，保衛祖國邊疆的神鷹部隊新一軍，有屏障松南的光輝戰績，他們的血汗流在邁向祖國統一大道的荆棘上。</p>
<p>這是一枝光榮的軍隊。前任軍長孫立人將軍的英名，遠播海外，他是一位儒將，愛護民衆是該軍的優良傳統，到處受民衆的熱誠愛戴，神魔部隊戰績卓著，並不是偶然的機遇。孫將軍已升任東北保安司令部副司令長官，他對記者談升遷的感想說：我覺得兩肩的負担輕了許多。但他爲國家民族盡忠的熱忱，則洋溢言表，歷久彌篤。他說：有一位記者小姐稱他爲老將軍，眞是遺憾，接着便哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>新任軍長潘裕民將軍，原是該軍五十師師長，是一位沉毅果敢的模施軍人，又是一位丹心鐵骨的硬將。在松花江畔的烽火綫上，在共軍的新春攻勢中，林彪與他硬碰硬的幹了好幾次，德惠的攻防戰最使林彪寒心，林彪曾以數萬之衆圍攻德惠，猛攻一週而不能克，蒙受很大的犧牲，不得不知難而退。記者那時在戰地會晤潘將軍，他在許多不眠之夜後，紅着眼睛吿訴記者：「共匪和我過不去，專門找我的麻煩」。　松花江北岸橋頭堡在歷次戰役中的孤軍苦鬥，最能代表潘將軍部下的硬骨頭，共軍拔掉了門牙，也沒有拔走這一根鐵釘。他們的光輝戰果，使他們的部隊獲得定名中正師的光榮，苦守橋頭堡的一連，定名爲中正連。</p>
<p>潘將軍在換任軍長後的第一次記者招待會上說：如我得到接收哈爾濱的命令，我首先宣佈這一個好消息。可見他爲國家民族是懷着一片如何深切的熱血忠魂，茲介紹潘將軍的略歷如次：　潘裕昆字孔希，湖南瀏陽人，黄埔軍校第四期步兵科曁軍校高級班第四期畢業，曾在廬山，珞珈山中訓團及印度藍姆加受訓。民國十四年任新編第二師見習官，排連營長等職，後參加北伐諸役負傷。廿六年升任十四師八三團上校國長，參加淞滬抗日負傷，調該師榮譽團團長，旋遷任十四師八十團團長，少將步兵指揮官，陸軍第五十師少將副師長兼政治部主任，三十三年二月升任五十師師長，本年四月五日升新一軍軍長，兼長春警備司令。</p>

<h3>毛姆提拔新進作家</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>英國劇作家毛姆（Somerset　Maugham此名gha無音，讀作Mawm不譯能作毛幹姆）給英國作家協會一萬五千磅，作爲基金，每年給一年在三十以下而有布望的作家。這獎金由作家協會的三位評判員選擇。這獎金的唯一條件就是：這作家必須到外國去花這個錢。</p>
<p>毛姆說：「隨便他願意到那兒去。只要他高興，他不妨到蒙特卡羅去一星期以內把它輸光；或者他經濟一點，拿這錢去環遊世界一週。這酬報是給出過一本書的人，無論詩歌，小說，傳記，哲學都行，只要評判員認爲他將來是有點成就的</p>
<p>「我請求評判員們，不要遲疑，不要怕冒險。我說過，他們在十個中，中選錯了九個也不要緊。我想，每十年只要有一個作家，眞的能產生點什麽，使得英國文學豐富起來，那也就很値得了。</p>
<p>「總之，每一世紀能產生十個作家，實在是很好的平均數了」。</p>
<p>毛姆在四十年前就有了這個意念，當時他正開始作戲劇家。他對蕭伯納說，評判員的年齡不能太大，最好不超過四十。過了四十歲的人也許會不了解新思想的。大約這三位評判員合共的年齡不會超過一百五十歲。</p>
<p>毛姆說『本來我想將這件事定在遺囑裏的。但我恐怕不能活得長久。我不耐等待，我想，最好在我活着的時候把這錢送出去」。</p>
<p>中國的兩個文藝刋物，「文藝復興」常刋載新進作家的作品，「文藝春秋」最近還出了一個新進作家專號：這用意可說是與毛姆一樣的。</p>
<h3>再過新寧（速寫）</h3>
<p>— KM</p>
<p>一座小山城，怎樣寗靜！</p>
<p>是洛卜美莎士遺忘了的傑作，</p>
<p>給生生地扔在這一帶石甕當中。</p>
<p>它是五嶺脈下的加德滿都；</p>
<p>它是小國裏的Graz的象形。</p>
<p>傍午，太陽由掛了靑藤的峯脊，</p>
<p>扶搖直上至天空，來俯瞰人們午餐；</p>
<p>向西偏的堡寨落身下去，</p>
<p>怎樣短暫呵，一塲幽夢！</p>
<p>柚子糖還在上市，</p>
<p>秋來梨形的小漿果，香又甜淸！</p>
<p>今且雇船到夫夷江！對岸隴間，</p>
<p>看那　褚大木，楓柟成林，</p>
<p>不結肉的香蕉，移植到嶺南，</p>
<p>便成鮮柔的果食品。</p>
<p>這裏只是些水墨畫家筆下的風景！</p>
<p>由武岡乘轎東行，經四天岩險　的行程，抵達城街東的石建小憩亭內。亭內照例有些殘廢人，或瑟縮在亭角，或呌賣米粉，油炙糯餅。椒堂下了轎，說首先要訪問的是新寗巨室劉家，（新任立院檢委的劉弘度老人，就是在這古邸中生長的）。</p>
<p>椒堂還記得六年前湘北首次會戰，由前方的緣故到這裏來，是一度觀光劉宅的。宅內的樓宇亭台，臨古池的軒榭，很帶些北平十刹海的風味。參空的樟柟大木，羅漢松，繞著高牆生著，畫廊雕棟，門牆之雅，有似瞻覽古畫。</p>
<p>劉宅有這樣祖傳的雅逸環境！……據說他們的祖代是曾左麾下一名有功的人員，那時候的澤蔭，至今猶光彩煥然，椒堂走過劉宅門口，躊躇了半晌，不是司閣人說「劉校長！（弘度先生之弟）還沒回家」，他已登堂直進了。</p>
<p>從後街轉到江岸，見新寗唯一的中學，立在山風撲拂當中，滿牆柳絮，只是向外搖拽不停。不幾步，急遇見六年前的相識林君。問到別後五年間的新寗，他說；</p>
<p>「還講什麽呢！都沒料到「桃源可避秦」這幾個字十二成不兌現。半年間的焚燒刧掠，竟沒一天能彀避免。我們家裏的用具多半都是從僻遠的鄉下運來的。」</p>
<h3>詩人的獨特</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>在日本鶴見氏的「拜侖傳」裏曾有這樣一段：</p>
<p>一八一一年，當拜侖剛旅行回倫敦時，得到母親逝世的噩耗，原來她因爲傢具商人的提高價格的賬單動怒而死。拜侖痛苦的趕回他的古堡去爲母親送葬，希奇的他不一直送葬到墓地去，却站在門口呆望。終於，他呌侍童別甫帶赴鬥拳手套和他猛烈的在家裏互相撲打起來。據說他是用這種兇惡的厮殺來解除道心底的悲痛的。</p>
<p>經過一帶窄窄的河街，椒堂忽想起早日吃狗肉的其頻君，一一位易卜生專家，僑居此間的邵陽新青年其頻君。他又憶起不時相過從的桂林畫家陽太陽，安化詩人吳奔星，杭州的高音唱歌家錢維楨，北平的教育者周振邦……他們都從各交通口紛紛遷避到內地，再輾轉紹介才臨這山國來的。</p>
<p>這一幫人，冬季開始未久，其頻忽罹了一塲一「汽槍殺妻」的家庭慘劇後，又紛紛到各地投他們的新主子去了。椒堂還影約憶得別去新寗的前一天，他到縣署內的監所去探看其頻。其頻帶着些微笑，很自然地說：</p>
<p>「誰知道什麽緣故！殺妻，哼，我自己也都不明白……簡直現在還矇瞳着。……不過，我父兄在時，因爲權力威大，怨家很不少。我不免覺得有些遭連累。……」</p>
<p>回憶回憶椒堂不禁向林君過提出這故事情節來，林君說，——其頻早引渡到邵陽監所去了。他的案子，在新寗似乎永無人探問。它永遠成了一個撲朔迷離的圈套……難道有人捉弄他？</p>
<p>新寗是如此一個地方麼？人們是如此虺其性豺其心？不像……他們那樣溫敦，喜怒不形於色呵！</p>
<p>林君吿訴椒堂說，一堡寨下面住的德國傳敎師又回來了，他的房子給東洋人毁去許多部份。他回到這個空廡，也和我們一般，無一天不感覺岑寂！……過夫夷江對河去看看吧，趁天早。」</p>
<h3>惜餘春三記——揚州續夢之十六</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>惜餘春情形，除前記外，當時座上客中，不少特有風趣者，亦不可不記：</p>
<p>（一）薛萬歲乃是一位老秀才。每日晚間，必燒酒四兩，喝得　然大醉。醉後便哼着京戲中道白「皇帝萬萬歲，小的天天醉。』人因呼爲萬歲。</p>
<p>（二）劉大令　此人人曾做過大令。可是性情暴躁，旣逐其予，復遣其妾，便獨自過活。每日三餐，幾乎都在惜餘春。且任意飲啖，一餐即費一元左右，但是現金交易，斷不記賬。並因家中無人，所有存款及收租的經摺，一槪捲在馬蹄袖中。</p>
<p>（三）金三花子　彼之家境很好，但所穿衣服却極破爛。家中人偶或爲其添製新衣，即隨時黨去賣去，自稱是花子命。以其行三，故有三花子之稱。</p>
<p>（四）汪火頭雅善唱戲，同輩如餉以香烟一枝，即可唱大曲一支。自命是汪桂分派，人因呼爲火頭。亦善詩歌，惜有阿芙蓉癖，窮困至於時時捱餓。其長衫衹是搭在左臂上不肯穿起。問其原因，則謂「我的長衫是擦酥的，一碰就散了！」（</p>
<p>五）蔣門神是一位醫生。平生並不善棋，但當他人著棋時，則必信口插嘴。著棋者如加以制止，便更起勁，一時以手作勢，亂指盤上。人家即報以惡聲，亦不生氣，依舊插嘴。因其身材很高，人因呼爲門神。</p>
<p>（六）王老本已七十餘歲，臉上却極紅漢。或謂其面似桃花。他說：「四字不類近體詩句。』人因添上「王老太』成七言一句。性喜　人打鬧，並常用旱烟袋邊人。人因其老，不便還手，即格格作　　美，宛如小兒。</p>
<p>（七）郭獃子業醫又兼敎館。家住念四橋，自號念四橋頭客。每日午後三時入城，十時出城。如遇城門關閉，便整夜坐在惜餘春。因其好淌口水，人多呼爲獃子。或更作一聯贈之：『念四橋頭，吟詩作對；十九阿鼻，敎館行醫。』</p>
<p>（八）短張此人是一秀才，因身材矮小，羣呼矮張。特好用假典欺人，人或問其出處，便笑謂：『何必認眞！』</p>
<p>（九）南斗北斗　王瞿二人，均六十餘歲，常川對坐在櫃檯外一張桌子上，却彼此不交一語。瞿性詼諧，人稱南斗，王性肉頭，人稱北斗。</p>
<p>此外得附帶說及者，惜餘春座上客也曾組織一樂曾。參與者必須起一別名，並須名姓相關。如先大外祖臧宜孫先生改名臧獲，此外吉亮工先生改名吉利，宣古愚光生改名宣布，孔小山先生改名孔方，譚亦偉先生改名譚閑，季先生金萍改名金錢，即連主人駝翁也改名高興了。</p>
<h3>少女之墓碑</h3>
<p>— 劉</p>
<p>Papillose型的可憐的希臘少女彫像，左乎托着一隻小箱，右手正在由箱內取出什麼飾物似的悲哀地站在那裏，但什麼飾物都沒有彫刻出來，察其痕跡，可知當時是　着極艷麗的色彩的。</p>
<p>這樣的作品，在希臘初期很多。在先史時代本來先有繪畫，而由繪畫演進到浮刻，這個墓碑應該就是這過程中的混合產物。</p>
<p>此作之布局，衣　之手法，肉體之表現，着實可觀。可謂紀元前五世紀上半葉端正的樣式之代表。原爲維納斯某貴族家藏，後爲德人收入柏林國立美術館。大理石質，高爲一，四二八米。</p>
<h3>夜雨——病中小記</h3>
<p>— 宣建人</p>
<p>夜深了，雨在屋上　着金屬的音樂。窗外舉黑二遍，病房里的一盞油燈，微弱的光綫，掃不掉屋內的黑暗。我睡不着，但我怎樣也不能控制我的思想的野馬。幼小時病了，母親的愛護，是那樣的慈祥，只要我翻一下身子，或是咳嗽一聲，她老人家會輕輕的走近牀前；就是夜深，母親也不閉眼的守護着；如今，她老人家已遠在古長安。我聽着窗外的雨凝，有無限的思念。……</p>
<p>隔壁病房又傳來了呻吟。</p>
<p>病，這魔鬼，何日可以消滅　我的年靑的生命，還沒有開過燦爛的花朵，就讓她這樣無聲的凋殘，我是不甘心的，我要向天控訴！</p>
<p>過去的許多殘夢，一個一個的惹我去溫習：遠在東北的欣，仍留在山城的若，失去消息的珠，已是孩子們的母親的英，……每一段殘夢，都是我用心血寫下的詩篇，讓我在靜夜裏朗誦，朗講到我生命的盡頭。我願人家的心扉上，寫下我的名字。</p>
<p>雨在落，落着。</p>
<h3>詩人臨終豪語</h3>
<p>— 孟龍</p>
<p>偉大的作家的臨終，往往是一幕悲壯劇之結束。詩人歌德，在死床上，大約是有感於人世的黯澹，喊出了一句最後的豪語：「多發一點光明罷！」與歌德同時代的詩人海湼，。在死前也不忘提出自已的遺囑；「請把一柄劍和一枝筆插上我的墓頭！」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　503</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「古承志先生嗎？一這是守一的電話，因鶴見在旅社註册上，用的自己原名，也把這原名的小史，吿訴過守一，所以守一用道個名字招呼鶴見：「我吿訴你兩件事；第一，那封信，……」（指着靑木長老畫着一個黑圓圈的神秘信箋而說。）「雖是寫得奇特，已經請敎過鄙莊覺厂老人。老人家說，這信還得經原收件人過目，方能起作用，……」這是說明這個神秘信件，還得萍子本人過目，才能發生作用。守一並隱約吿訴鶴見，覺厂老人，並非不能運用這個作用；不過萍子是青木老人的心靈交通媒介，當然以萍子本人來通，最合心靈科學方式原理。……</p>
<p>「萬一收件本人，不能出來，到午夜，老人答應了自己動手。」守一說明這一點，是要減少鶴見的焦灼。即使萍子在午夜十二點以後，還沒有從匪窟裏出來，責厂老人，也可試騐一下。</p>
<p>「第二件需要說明的事，照老人的分析，三個「窩子」，以虹鎭地段的那一個，最爲適合。雖說那邊解送的是兩個人，並且都是男性，但也許這是匪徒的烟幕作用，呌人不易猜測。另外，老人對匪徒這個辦法，悟到其中，恐怕還有別的作用。至於什麽作用，因老人不大明瞭日人間諜內幕，暫時不能解釋。……對於這三個窩子，本莊同人，擬有另外辦法，暫時還沒有規定步驟，回頭見面再談……」。</p>
<p>鶴見收到了守一這個電話，心上一塊石頭，落下了一大半。本來，他這次同萍子南來，最大目標，當然是要破除日本軍部計劃的「八的秘密」行動。他本人對這一舉，當然不算主動，而這主動的執行人萍子，行動上也固然神秘，實際上恐怕也只是一個工具，受着幕後靑木長老的指揮；連她自己，也是機喊式的，受一步指揮，實行一步。</p>
<p>不過臨到最後這等重要的一步，竟爾遭到這種意外，時間又是這等緊促；那最後一道錦囊妙計。又僅僅是一個黑墨圓圈，除了萍子本人以外，這個命令簡直等於一個啞謎，也可說有些過分的游戲三昩甚至好像兒戲。試想，假定這時沒有韓万的革命志士來參加行動，沒有最高反諜綱主持人，差派李明來合作，也沒有百忍莊這些劍客式的愛國份子來扶持，要呌鶴見一人，僅僅加上一個正岩，碰到這們棘手的問題，能解決得了嗎？</p>
<p>再說，這個「八的秘密」，鶴見雖說在北平和W等，有過各種揣測，後來萍子也會說明了這秘密的性質，方式；然而日本軍部，處心積慮，佈置下這等巨大的一個秘密行動，豈是兒戲，又豈能這等簡單？那重要關鍵是什麽？那發動這巨大秘密的步驟，又是怎樣的？就算能够抓住了這個關鍵，明瞭了發動的各步驟，究竟如何去破壞呢？縱今有了確定完備的方法去破壞，這時間上如此緊促，能够充分辦到嗎？</p>
<h3>夢外樓詩</h3>
<p>— 徐澄宇</p>
<p>題姜詠鴻遺草</p>
<p>故人有遺草，紙墨紛離陸；披卷憶平生，精爽猶在目；淸辭追白雪，秋風響綠竹；相對寂無言，拂塵感流瀑。</p>
<p>謝陸儼少贈畫</p>
<p>陸君揮毫世莫匹，林中高士呼欲出；風烟蒼莽來松間，絕澗幽藝回雲日；遠道贈我懸座隅，對之淸曠復超逸。</p>
<h3>碧湘閣詞</h3>
<p>— 陳家慶</p>
<p>齊天樂夏夜和淸眞</p>
<p>水雲隔斷花南北，林　漸看天晚；萍末流香，鷗波穩夢，好把荷衣輕剪，銀屛月掩；正烟冷　釭，凉生湘鞏，漫托微吟，楚騷淸怨入詩卷。</p>
<p>難問藉事，流塵驚歲月，幽恨何限？竹外吹簫，酒邊說劍，空使秋心宛轉，良宵意遠；待嘴蕊調冰，玉盤初薦，觸起閒情，黛蛾愁更歛。</p>
<p>掃花遊松圖晚坐同玉姊</p>
<p>薄寒似酒，正醉後重陽，亂愁無數；行行不語，對秋容澹冶，漫吟秀句；梧葉蕭蕭，禁得幾多風雨？悄回顧，傍柳下池塘，還覓佳處。</p>
<p>芳意餘幾許，這重續清遊；吟邊歡聚，華年迅羽，怕秋光一寸，又成輕去；短笛西風，欲把閒情付與；暗凝佇，看斜陽漸低林樹。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>希臘神話裏載着——</p>
<p>普洛米修士（Promctheus）是人類的恩人，因爲他從天上盜火給人，乃被火神宙斯（Zeus）轉禁。後來宙斯覺悟到他是先知者，並且打算恢復他的自由，可是矜持的普洛米修士正認爲替人類受　乃是他的義務，終於拒絕了火神的恩赦。</p>
<p>痛苦，受難，成爲一切先知者必然的命運。</p>
<p>這表現在哲人宗敎家，便是從容地忍受；沒有怨尤。儀蘇格拉底的飲鴆和基　的釘死在十字架上，都給歷史鑄成了不滅的聖蹟——這是人類理想中的至善。</p>
<p>而表現在詩人藝術家，便是熱烈地呐喊；一往情深。像屈原但丁的放逐和史遷的接受可怕的腐刑，他們不屈服，至死尙續　於人我——這是人類理想中的至眞。</p>
<p>以　——眞，這——善；去和宇宙的美去求調和均勻的，便是人生光榮的目的。</p>
<p>朋友問起我對於人生的看法，我回答了如上的話。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>理想夫婦</h3>
<p>— 戈夷</p>
<p>法人楊思奇夫人，抱着她眞純底愛環避世界，找尋她理想中的夫婦。這位善良而偉大的太太，她希冀在夫婦的愛情中探求愛的秘密，藉使世界上沒有曠夫怨婦，進而使人類的愛情浸沐在諧和的幸福中。</p>
<p>夫人最近到了上海。卅日在蘭心戲院作了一次公開的講演，題目就是「環遊全世界尋找理想的夫婦」她說她從意大利到巴萊斯丁，西班牙，巴黎，但是她所經過的地方，有的夫婦間充滿了情殺或仇視，有的是嘴裏揖着甜蜜的吻手中拿着鋒利的刀，有的是過着淫佚的生活，有的是忍受，單調，又有的因爲沒有小孩，不免使夫婦間生活失却溫暖。最後她到了上海，終於碰到了幸福的夫婦。這一對最理想的中國夫婦，他們愛情的秘訣就是每隔三月有一星期的靜默，在這星期內謝絕一切外務，使整個家庭在休息狀態中。過此依然恢復原狀。</p>
<p>我眞不知道楊夫人這一個宣佈是眞實的也還是玩意兒？如果愛情的幸福便在這一個分合之中，那米理想夫婦似乎也並不怎樣的難於實現吧。如果這不是一個結論，那末理想夫婦到底又是怎樣的？世界上到底有否理想夫婦？</p>
<p>我曾有一個僾想：一切的「理想」都是永存的，但要尋求這理想的「實際」，那就有點等於水中撈月。夫婦間的愛情也是如此。我們可有「理想中的夫婦」，但我們却永遠找不到」理想夫婦」。這因爲理想是最前進的，當理想成爲現實時，另一個新的理想又在招引我們。好些夫婦常覺得他們的家庭欠缺某樣東西不够理想，但是當他補足了那缺陷時，他又不能自滿。又有的因爲夫婦間沒有孩子，覺得家庭間清寂陰妻，但到了他們有了孩子，反又厭惡家庭間的繁擾不堪了！人類永不能在現實中自滿，所以人類時時產生他的理想；追求理想，促進現實，這也許便是社會進化的動力吧。</p>
<p>夫婦間的幸福是不是神秘的？和諧的愛情又有什麽秘訣？這些都在主觀的性情，知識，健康來決定的。而且雙方是相對的，不是絕對的。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰曾有一句名言：「男女都要回到各自的工作崗位上去」。理想夫婦也許就產生這樣的條件之下吧。</p>
<h3>金錢難買</h3>
<p>— 嚴安孚</p>
<p>在我從海外回來後第一個晚上，我去探望我的愛人。她的父親和母親很知趣，讓我們兩人單獨在會客室裏談心。當我倆在擁抱接吻之際，突然發覺她年幼的妹妹在門口張大着兩隻眼睛對我們望着。「如果你願做一個好孩子，快回到房裏去安睡，」我對那個小女孩說，「那末我就給你二角五分錢。」</p>
<p>那孩子並不接受我的賄賂，也不說話，就跑開了。但是不一會她又回來了。「這裏是五角錢，」她說道，「讓我在旁邊瞧着你們。」</p>
<h3>關於浮生六記</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>浮生六記是一本家傳戶誦的著作，因爲它的體裁特別，以一自傳的故事，兼談生活藝術，閒情逸致，山水景色，文評藝評等。因此，中國作者們大都嗜愛本書，林語堂就是一個最好的例子，他曾經把它譯成英文，分段刋載於英文天下月刋和西風月刋，後來由西風社出版單行本，譯名爲Six　Chaptrs　of　a　Floating　Life，頗使國外讀者徘徊不能卒讀。</p>
<p>作者乾隆時蘇州沈復（三白），死於何時雖不知，但依書中自述，第四記之寫作必在一八〇八年之後，現有的四記是楊引傳在蘇州冷攤上所發現，於一八七七年首先刋行，四記的名目是：閨房記樂，閒情記趣，坎坷記愁，浪遊記快；至於所闕的二記則是中山記歷和養生記道，由管貽　的時及尙存回目中，我們知道第五章是記他在台灣時的經歷，而第六章是記他對於義生之道的心得和感想。</p>
<p>但是現在市面上所印行的一本浮生六記（世界書局出版）居然把殘缺的，二記也復覓得據說這也是某著名作家於蘇州某處發現的，而且把養生記道一章更正爲養生記逍，當然，發現者自有他的根據，一是否可靠仍爲沈氏手筆，我們固不必論它；但是筆者偶與我師鄭逸梅談及此事，却知道另外一段有關浮生六記的事實，也許對於「新發現」的二記稍有牽涉。</p>
<p>據鄭氏謂也嘗聞某著名老作家於蘇州發現二記之說，該二記老途經係作家茶農田而見一農夫翻閱者，索借閱讀之下，駭然乃全部浮生六記，驚奇之餘，乃商借一日，盡閱六記，深信仍係三白所作，於是遄返上海，與世界</p>
<p>北大中文系敎授馮文炳（即廢名）定二十七日上午在西四牌樓居士林講一佛敎儒敎與西洋哲學」。（米喜林）當局訂立版約，迨再返吳地，農夫已携　他遷，不知所蹤，窮數月追尋，終無所得，老作家不勝態慮，乃商之我師逸梅，以其文筆頗近沈復，擬盡其記憶重寫二記，我師未敢應承，婉言謝辭。至於以後世界書局出版浮生六記之詳細情形，是否二記重復獲得，抑或係後人偽作，則都不得而知。</p>
<h3>北大近事</h3>
<p>— 米喜林</p>

<p>北大「北京人」壁報爲紀念「五四」及發揮其偉大精神，定是日舉辦「五四史料展覽會」，凡有關史料之報章，雜誌，政會，文吿，私人函件及紀念物等均在積極搜集中。</p>
<p>北大中文系教授馮文炳（即廢名）定二十七日上午在西四牌樓居士林講「佛教需教與西洋哲學」。</p>
<h3>介紹——「新聞天地」</h3>
<p>— 珂珮</p>
<p>——一本優秀的報道性刋物</p>
<p>在物質條件缺乏的情形下，一本優良的刋物仍能不斷的繼續下去，無論在編者，在讀者都會感覺得很高興的。</p>
<p>首先我得介紹這期的幾篇文章，關於國內戰局的有莫訶薩的「廷安之戰五天六夜」和萬兆京的「濟南外圍共軍及其他」，以最精短的筆法把一月來的戰局明明白白的勾畫出來了。一般寫時事性的文章，不是把自己看得太高，便是把對方估量得太低，這不但容易失却時局的眞實性，在讀者也往往被墮入五里霧中，在這裏却能站在客觀的立塲根據事實來報導，這是非常難能可貴的。政治性內幕的有宋中堂的「三中全會中的幾門大砲」，它不但客觀的報導了事實，也把幾位代表的個性都描繪出來了。一月前發生的台灣事件和舉世矚目的大連接收問題，在這裏也有很詳細的報導。其餘如「英國未女在王伊莉莎伯」，「刨黄瓜兒季節」等篇，輕鬆雋永，餘味無窮。</p>
<p>我很興奮的看完了這期的每一篇文章，這裏會發現你所不知道的事物，雖然稱不上良師，也够得到益友。自然缺點仍不能避免，一本報導性的刊物最好能與時間配合，就以這一期來說，「延安之戰五天六夜」，「台灣，人爲的颱風」等篇，都是發生在一月前的事，能早些見面豈不更好，因此，假如經濟條件容許的話，我們很希望「新聞天地」能改出半月刋。</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>— 聲</p>
<p>南京國立音樂院著名聲樂敎授蘇石林氏，於本月二日在首都舉行獨嗎會，演唱世界名曲及著名歌劇作品。</p>
<p>國立上海音專已決定於本月十八，十九兩日，假座蘭心大戲院公開舉行勝利後復校之第一次師生聯合演奏會。此次演奏節目極爲精彩，除選拔優秀學生參加外，該校著名敎授馬格林斯基，拉査當夫，勒布，應尙能，陳又新等均參加演奏。聞票價訂兩萬，一萬元兩種。</p>
<p>南京國立音樂院，國立上海音專及福建音專三校校長及主持敎務人員，聞將在京舉行聯合會議，商討學生程度及課程標準之訂定，以期嚴格實施，造就優秀之音樂人才。</p>
<p>我國著名抒情男高音黄源尹，近應本市粽藝影片公司之聘請，祖任該公司新攝之「吉人天相」一片歌唱部份男主角，主唱主題歌一支，挿曲二支，黄君參加市音樂協會組織之音樂訪問團，出國在即，此爲其出國前臨別紀念之作品。</p>
<p>市政府交響樂團，將於本月十一日假蘭心大戲院舉行整頓後之第二次公開演奏，仍由富華敎授担任指揮，節目較上次豐富，該團自經上海昔專管理後，陣容整齊，煥然一新。</p>
<h3>天韻樓的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>永安公司的天韻樓，爲了「維護風化」關係，自五月一日起實行停業，據說該樓六百職工，困守棋內已達五日，平日積蓄已吿用罄，現在全部食用，僅賴同情人士供應，有一記者前往視察，祗見男女老幼雜居，妻帝兒號，爲狀之慘，令人目不忍睹。眼見這六百職工和他們的家屬，還要在這個狀態之下，挨餓下去。</p>
<p>天韻樓的妨害風化之處，人所共知。而且妨害已久。怎麽現在老闆忽然一反從前的作爲而要對風化加以維護了呢？然而人總是有向上心的。老闆要天韻樓棄邪歸正，我們總不能說不好，問題還在那六百名職工和他們的家屬。老闆棄邪歸正了，夥計生活斷絕了，這些夥計平日的職務，未必與風化有關，然而當老闆要停業，而他們都要求展期的時候，他們就等於要求把那妨害風化的營業維持下去，彷彿老闆要向正路上跑，而他們則拖他躭在邪路上面，如果我們能把目光放遠一些，職工們實在應該放棄他們這種要求。</p>
<p>可是吃飯問題却比那遠大的目光來得嚴重。一旦停業，就須挨餓。職工們平日積蓄毫無，自然不能長久維持。同情人士的供應本來不多，而且更不能長久維持，這種塲所唯有老闆顧念到過去賓主的關係，多少年來他曾經集了這些職工賺了多少錢，放出大決心，替他們想一個打開生路的辦法。</p>
<p>像天韻樓一樣需要來一次「維護風化」的革新運動的地方，實在不少，許多人多少年來都在社會的默許之下，幹着某種直接或間接有害社會的營生。對於這些事情我們都主張加以停止或革新。然而第一個條件是要主持人先替那些賴此爲生的人們換一條路走，否則好的花沒有開，壤的果子都先已結成了。天韻樓的悲劇便是一個例。</p>
<p>「大槪三十幾個人」。祝兆年堆着滿臉的笑回答。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「大槪三十幾個？不成！不成！要有準數！這是公事，怎麽可以隨你亂說的！」余科長滿臉大不爲然的神氣。</p>
<p>祝兆年不防還有這一關，頓時被駁得啞口無言。</p>
<p>「回去辦一個公事來！還要名單！」鐵靑着臉的余科長像對付一個當差似的呼叱着。</p>
<p>「可是……可是……」老祝回頭去望了望壁上的時鐘，急得發昏。</p>
<p>「這是公事！」對方像怒吼一樣的回答。　老　起身就走。他知道跟習氣這樣深的老衙門講理是白費的。幸而距離五點鐘還有六七十分鐘光景，估量回去趕辦一件公事帶來也還來得及，便忘命似的飛奔回去；仗着劇團裏的人多，七手八脚的一會兒居然把公事和名單一起辦好了。——是張昌做的主把閘和緋緝也寫進了名單去。</p>
<p>氣急敗壞的老祝重復再趕回交通處的時候離五句鐘剛差十二分，他像一陣風似的直撲到余科畏的辦公桌上。</p>
<p>「公事名單都有了！對不起，請趕辦一下！」他向那正在抽烟看報的科畏老爺求吿着，聲音有些發抖，自己也控制不住了。</p>
<p>余科長緩緩地放下報紙，先取起信封來端相了一二分鐘，然後才抽出裏面的信紙，又看了三四遍；忽然，他的缺乏營養的枯褐色的臉又望下一沉，同時連連搖頭</p>
<p>祝兆年的心直跳。</p>
<p>「不行！公事上沒有關防，我們不能交代！又是一個老祝所永遠不會料想到的理由。</p>
<p>「可是我們是一個劇團，那兒來關防呢？」老祝開始有一些被激怒了。</p>
<p>「不行這是公事」又是兩句刻板的不講理的官話。</p>
<p>「那是不是還要我們臨時去刻起來？」老祝的眼睛瞪圓了，身子俯向前去，緊緊地隊定着那位已失掉了人性的大半的老公務員。「可是，你們的車子明兒一早就要開了」！</p>
<p>「這我管不着，我只知道公事」！對方側過臉，毫不為動。</p>
<p>現在，老祝眞是不能再忍耐了，他仲過手去，一下就從余科長手裏搶回了那封公函，立刻站起身，跨着極大的步子，衝進態處長的辦公室去。（六五）</p>

<h3>National Army Converges in Two Routes at Tai'an, Jinan-Jining Traffic Restored, Annihilation War to Commence in Yimeng Mountains</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The National Army, under the command of Wang Jingjiu, departed from Dawenkou northward at 11:30 AM on the 6th, retaking Tai'an. The Communist 10th Column fled eastward. Communist casualties in this battle reached eight to nine thousand. With the recapture of Tai'an, the east-west lines of the Hong Army were severed again, and the encirclement of the Communists became smaller. The Jinpu Railway traffic was thus able to resume.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] The National Army on the Jinpu front in central Shandong advanced with unstoppable momentum, retaking Tai'an at 11:30 AM on the 6th. The remaining Communist forces fled eastward. The National Army seized a large amount of supplies, and the battle results are being assessed. At 12:00 noon, the National Army moving north from Dawenkou and the National Army under Wang Yaowu moving south from Jieshou officially converged at Tai'an, Xuzhou. Traffic between Jinan was also officially restored. The Communist forces in western Shandong and the Yimeng Mountains have been completely isolated and dismembered and can be defeated and annihilated one by one.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] A major battle to annihilate the main force of the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains of central Shandong is about to begin. The remnants of the Communist 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 10th Columns, totaling more than 50,000 men, who fled east from Tai'an and Feicheng, are currently concentrated in the triangle area of Xintai, Laiwu, and Tai'an, attempting to take advantage of any opportunity to make trouble. However, the National Army has already detected their conspiracy and quickly adopted a preemptive strategy. The Xintai National Army launched attacks in two routes on the morning of the 5th. The right-wing National Army recovered Nanshidian, 30 kilometers south of Laiwu, and the highlands north of Jindoushan at 9:00 AM on the 5th. The left-wing National Army recovered Zhushan and Dongxiyu, 20 kilometers northwest of Xintai, at noon on the 5th. This group of Communist forces is now trapped in the National Army's pocket formation and can be annihilated in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3>Insufficient Funds for Various Agencies Decided to Double the Budget, Second Meeting of the Political Affairs Council Passed Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The soaring prices of the past half-month have created major financial problems for various government agencies.

<h3>External Affairs Ministry to Issue Statement Clarifying Our Position on the Lushun-Dalian Issue, Gong Xuesui Reaffirms Good Neighbor Policy</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement soon regarding the acceptance of Lushun-Dalian, clarifying our nation's position. According to reports, Soviet Ambassador Petrov visited Foreign Minister Wang on the afternoon of the 5th to respond to our previous note. The Foreign Ministry declined to announce the contents of the Soviet response.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] Gong Xuesui received reporters at 4 p.m. on the 6th and stated, "The issue of receiving Dalian is of utmost concern to both Chinese and foreign individuals. The current government is negotiating with allied nations through diplomatic channels. Once the negotiations have a result, and the central government issues an order, we can proceed with the acceptance. Mr. Gong continued to state that the sovereignty of Dalian is clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and not only do China and the Soviet Union have a mutual obligation to comply, but it is also of great importance to peace in the Far East. As for the key points of my administration after taking over Dalian, I will adhere to the good neighbor policy to establish friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, stabilize local order, provide relief to refugees, promote industry and commerce, and develop education as the foundation."</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] Ti Xuesui visited Du Yuming on the evening of the 5th and went to various offices of the Northeast Headquarters on the morning of the 6th, and received reporters at 4 p.m. According to Mr. Xi, everyone has the opportunity to develop industry and commerce based on the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, and the treaty is accompanied by naval maps. The maps of the Jin City District of Lushun-Dalian are not attached, but original maps are available for reference.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] Regarding the Lushun-Dalian reception issue, the crux of the matter, it is said, remains the troop deployment issue. The opinions of China and the Soviet Union have not converged. Furthermore, the Dalian municipal government feels that personnel and funding are insufficient, and a training session for reception personnel. can begin next week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] According to sources familiar with the situation, the Soviet response to the Lushun-Dalian issue is not satisfactory. However, the content of the response cannot be disclosed. The Soviet Union's position on the Lushun area is based on the premise that "a peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, so the state of war continues technically." China believes that this position is not in line with reality, as Japan has long been defeated and has become an occupied country. The sovereignty of Dalian and Lushun, like other areas north of Yan, belongs entirely to China, as clearly stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. If there are communist troops in the suburbs of Dalian and China has no troops to protect it, there is little hope of receiving the administration of the area. Merely relying on the police is obviously insufficient.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Facing the Current Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, rice prices have skyrocketed, and all other prices have risen in a straight line. The rate of increase is truly alarming, threatening everyone's livelihood, especially those who rely on salaries or wages for income, who are almost in a state of constant anxiety. Since the government implemented emergency economic measures in mid-February, the cost of living index has been frozen. However, prices have not only failed to stabilize but have continued to rise day by day. Taking rice prices as an example, they have increased two or three times in the past two months. In this state of imbalance between prices and wages, the calls for unfreezing the cost of living index have also risen with the soaring prices. This issue has not only attracted social attention but has also been emphasized by the government. According to our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, the Executive Yuan also discussed the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index at its meeting yesterday morning. It is reported that agreement has been reached in principle, but the specific measures for unfreezing are still under deliberation. It is expected that this issue will be reasonably resolved around the middle of this month. However, amidst the skyrocketing prices, in addition to the nationwide workers' demand to unfreeze the cost of living index, what concerns us most is the treatment of civil servants and soldiers who serve the country. With their meager income, they are almost unable to survive under the pressure of current high prices. The impact on the country and society will also be very close, making it impossible for us not to appeal to the government and the public to arouse everyone's attention.</p>
<p>The postwar economic difficulties in our country are undeniable facts, and there is no need to shy away from them. In fact, in the postwar world, even in countries like Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, after long periods of war, no country has not been plagued by food shortages and fuel shortages, and no country has not been complaining about economic difficulties. However, they mostly have good strategies and ingenious plans, and each has its own proper methods for dealing with postwar economic difficulties. For example, in Britain, the economic difficulties are no less than in our country. Foreign Secretary Bevin recently returned from Moscow and said with great indignation: The most difficult thing for Britain in diplomacy is that Britain "has neither coal for export nor goods and funds to lend to other countries."</p>
<p>Britain's inability to take care of itself economically can be clearly seen from this. The second is France. During the Blum cabinet, due to the high prices, labor unrest spread across the country. Therefore, it resolutely implemented a policy to suppress prices. Although it was effective for a while, by the time of the Ramadier cabinet, the policy of suppressing prices did not achieve the expected results. As a result, the workers' movement to demand wage increases arose from this. The Communist Party supported the workers' demands and voted against the cabinet's policy, which caused a huge wave in the political arena, forcing the Communist Party members of the cabinet to withdraw. This political turmoil has come to an end, but it is still difficult to predict how the political situation in France will evolve in the future. Finally, there is the Soviet Union. The rapid recovery of the Soviet Union after the war is indeed admirable, but the damage suffered by the Soviet Union during the war was too great and too deep. Therefore, it still feels considerable economic difficulties. The first issue of domestic bonds is about to be used up, and now it has to issue a second issue of domestic bonds worth 200 billion rubles. This point alone can show the whole picture of the Soviet economy.</p>
<p>However, in countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, no matter how scarce resources are and no matter how difficult the economy is, they can still maintain the calm of the national economic life. Especially in Britain, the daily necessities of the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation still implement the wartime rationing system. London has never experienced a black market due to the scarcity of necessities. Recently, the British people have also launched a national savings movement to help the government complete the great cause of recovery and prosperity as soon as possible. Britain has never been like our country, often experiencing waves of soaring prices. From this point of view, we dare to say boldly that although our country's economy is extremely difficult, it is by no means impossible to stabilize people's livelihoods and stabilize prices. The constant rise in prices in our country after the war has various reasons. However, the main reason is that our authorities have failed to plan comprehensively and establish a complete economic policy, only knowing how to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. Moreover, the prescriptions for treating the head and the foot often change from morning to evening. Before the plan is implemented, a new plan is changed. Reviewing the economic policies of the past two years after the war, we cannot but point out that the economic policies during the period of President Song failed due to free trade, completely ignorant of cherishing foreign exchange, and allowing people to freely order materials from abroad, resulting in foreign goods flooding the market, industrial and commercial decline, and exhaustion of foreign exchange, making it impossible to support. Later, although it has realized and adopted control measures, the flood has already flooded, and repairing the dikes is no longer recoverable. The emergency economic measures implemented in February this year were produced in this way. However, this measure was not implemented for a long time, and President Song resigned, and the government was brewing a reorganization. It was not until the end of April that the reorganized new government was established. Therefore, this emergency measure can be said to have never been effectively implemented. Moreover, when President Zhang attended the Legislative Yuan for the first time, he frankly stated that the emergency economic measures would be revised or abolished. At the same time, the price limit for rice in Shanghai was also ordered to be abolished and allowed to be traded freely. Even the simplest-minded person would know that the government's economic policy will have fundamental changes. What's more, Shanghai has always been a speculative market, and when nothing is happening, it often has to catch wind and shadows and try to make waves. Now that they have heard President Zhang's statement, it is certainly an excellent reason for speculation. Therefore, the chaos in the market these days is indeed caused by human factors. However, the government's contradictory words and deeds cannot but bear considerable responsibility. We have to point out the following two points here to awaken the attention of the whole country.</p>
<p>First, we believe that the reorganized new government should choose one of the following two paths to cope with the current economic difficulties. One is to inherit the economic policies of President Song's era, strengthen economic control, and effectively implement emergency economic measures until the goal is achieved. The second is to adopt new plans and implement new methods. But if the government abandons the old road and takes the new road, we ask the government to pay attention to the following points. (1) New policies must be carefully considered and considered absolutely certain before they can be adopted. Do not try them out with an experimental attitude. (2) When policies change, be sure to keep them secret, because before and after policies change, it is easiest to cause financial turmoil. (3) To adopt a new plan, we must immediately come up with a solution and can no longer delay.</p>
<p>Second, we want everyone in the society to recognize the current crisis. If we do not find a way to save it as soon as possible, then in the long run, it will only create opportunities for the Communist Party. We all know that communism is not suitable for China, because Chinese society does not have a disparity between the rich and the poor. However, the current economic situation is accelerating the differentiation of society into two major classes. People who can speculate and take advantage can become rich overnight. Honest and law-abiding legitimate businessmen cannot stand in society. If this situation cannot be saved by the policy of the Three Principles of the People, then is today's society not creating opportunities for the Communist Party!</p>
<p>In short, the current domestic economic situation is extremely serious and has reached the edge of total collapse. However, we still believe that human power can overcome nature. As long as the whole country, from top to bottom, can recognize a common goal and work together with one heart, it can overcome all difficulties. The difficulties that other countries can safely overcome, we believe that our country will also be able to overcome safely and reach the other shore of prosperity and strength!</p>

<h3>Issue of Jewish Representatives' Attendance: UN General Assembly Passes Compromise Plan: Allowed to State Opinions in the Political Committee</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, Flushing Meadow, 5th] The United Nations General Assembly, in plenary session today, passed a resolution by a vote of 44 to 7, with 3 abstentions, instructing the Political Committee to hear the opinions of representatives of the Jewish Agency on the Palestine issue. The resolution also stipulates that the opinions of other parts of the Palestinian people should be decided by the Political Committee, which is the result of a compromise between the Bland proposal and the American proposal. A proposal by the Czech Republic and Poland that representatives of the Jewish Agency express their opinions to the General Assembly was rejected by a vote of 39 to 8, with 7 abstentions. After the method of Jewish representatives' statements was decided, attention is now focused on the question of the Palestine High Committee's request to make a statement. It is reported that the Arab League has instructed its member states to insist that if representatives of the Jewish Agency are allowed to make a statement, the Arab High Committee must also be allowed to make a statement.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 5th] The Chairman of the UN General Assembly's Political Committee, Canadian representative Pearson, convened the committee to meet this morning to begin organizing the Palestine Investigation Committee.</p>

<h3>British Imperial Chiefs of Staff Conference: Discussing Cooperation Between the Navy, Army, and Air Force: Commanders-in-Chief of Overseas British Troops Are All in Attendance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th Special Telegram] Britain's largest postwar defense conference began today. The attendees included the Commanders-in-Chief of Britain and the British Empire, including 76 field marshals and generals, 44 naval admirals and senior naval officers, 5 marine generals, and some senior air force officers.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] British army, navy, and air force generals held a secret meeting at the Sandhurst Military Academy today, chaired by Field Marshal Montgomery, Chief of the General Staff. This is the most important military conference since the planning of the Normandy landing. British military commanders from all over the world, such as General Robertson, Commander-in-Chief of the British Occupation Forces in Japan, were summoned back to the country to participate in the conference. According to informed sources, in view of the fact that British senior generals believe that the separation of the army, navy, and air force is an outdated system in modern warfare, this conference will discuss the close cooperation between the three services. In addition, the issue of new weapons and their uses will also be discussed. As far as air power is concerned, the Commander of the Royal Air Force once said that the advent of the atomic age means the disappearance of large-scale bombing teams. It is reported that the Navy Department is still unable to determine the impact of atomic bombs on the navy. Some parties expect the navy to use aircraft carriers to carry atomic-bomb-equipped aircraft, but the problem of using merchant fleets and escort teams cannot be solved as a result.</p>
<h3>Turkish President Receives US Fleet Commander</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Istanbul, 5th] Turkish President Inonu suddenly arrived here from Ankara today to receive US Mediterranean Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Billie, who is leading four US warships, including the 27,000-ton aircraft carrier Leyte, on a six-week cruise in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Voice of Jinshan broadcasted on the 6th: Turkish President Inonu reviewed the US fleet and Turkish warships that recently arrived in the Dardanelles Strait today. US and Turkish warships fired a 21-gun salute. The Turkish President delivered a speech, which stated that Turkey has a deep understanding of the friendship and importance of the US fleet's visit to Turkey. After the speech, US and Turkish naval personnel cheered loudly.</p>
<h3>House Begins Debate on US Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill</h3>
<p>The Opposition Party Will Hinder All Attempts</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Political figures here said last night that when the House of Representatives begins debating Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey today, all opponents will go all out, most of whom are Wallace's supporters and old-fashioned isolationists. They all believe that spending $400 million to stop the spread of communism will ultimately be futile. Political figures also predicted that when the bill is submitted to the House, the opposition will first demand that the entire plan be sent to the United Nations. If this motion is rejected, they will probably demand that it be sent to the Military Committee for discussion, because this bill has a military nature. If both motions fail, a few Republican senators will try to remove its military clauses to cancel aid to Turkey. House leaders said that although the opponents are active, the aid bill is expected to be passed by a satisfactory majority in the House.</p>
<h3>Izvestia Comments on Marshall's Speech: Says Its Purpose Is to Blame the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] "Izvestia" published a long editorial today, explaining the Soviet Union's previous clear and determined attitude, accusing the US State Department of supporting reactionaries, "encouraging hostility towards the Soviet Union," and condemning US Secretary of State Marshall for "blaming the Soviet Union" for the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, "intending to slander." Most Soviet people believe that the US State Department is generally anti-Soviet and do not deny it, but this "Izvestia" editorial is particularly sharp. It is said that Marshall's broadcast report to the American people on April 28 about the progress of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was "untrue." Senator Vandenberg said that Marshall's speech had been discussed in advance by the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties at the White House, which shows that the general anti-Soviet sentiment is even deeper than that of the State Department. Marshall's speech has given people a "wrong impression" of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, blaming the Soviet delegation for lacking sincerity in the agreement, in order to prove the legitimacy of his own actions and arouse the American people's dissatisfaction with Soviet policy. Marshall's advisor Dulles' broadcast report on the conference's work also "distorted the facts." Marshall gave the conference an inaccurate assessment, obviously because the positions of the US and British representatives when debating the German issue were by no means a genuine guarantee of trying to establish sound peace and prevent aggression.</p>
<h3>The Political and Legal Situation Remains Unstable; the US May Help France Address the Economic Crisis, but Only on the Condition of Implementing Anti-Communist Policies</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] London, 6th Dispatch: The French government's open rejection of the Communist Party is a first attempt since the liberation, and this policy is now facing a serious test. Four hundred representatives of the Socialist Party convened a national conference today to vote on the expulsion of the five Communist ministers from the coalition cabinet. If rejected, the government will collapse, and France will face its most serious political crisis in recent years.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th Dispatch] Although the political storm in France on Sunday has subsided, the political situation remains unstable as the Socialist Party convenes a national congress to make a final decision on the reorganization of the Ramadier cabinet. Political figures here say that Ramadier will likely form a cabinet without the participation of the Communist Party, in accordance with the agreement of the Socialist Party's parliamentary group. The majority opinion of the national congress will likely support this proposal, but the opinions of Socialist Party members in the provinces will also be taken into consideration. Regarding the economic adjustment measures of the future cabinet, the Radical Party will try to implement a more liberal economic policy than that adopted by the Minister of National Economy, Philip, or may propose to replace the Minister of Economy. It is reported that the parliamentary group of the People's Republican Movement held a meeting yesterday, and Vice Premier and party leader De Gaulle praised the Communist Party's understanding of the government's problems and its goodwill in seeking solutions. Some observers here speculate that if the Socialist Party's national congress refuses to break with the Communist Party, the People's Republican Movement may propose to lead the next cabinet. At the same time, political observers are paying close attention to the French General Confederation of Labor's support for wage earners and its demands for improved living conditions. People expect that the current unexpected state of calm in Paris may be followed by a situation of social difficulty.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th Dispatch] Senior US officials announced today that the United States may step up aid to France's economic crisis, but only on the condition that Prime Minister Ramadier can unite his new non-Communist coalition cabinet. It is reported that officials from the US Embassy are drafting a detailed report on what kind of assistance the French government needs and the amount of assistance. It is expected that France will have new demands for solving food, fuel, and industrial problems, so the report must be revised before it can be sent to Washington. The decisive factor in the United States' willingness to support this new anti-Communist bulwark in Western Europe depends on whether the French Socialist Party led by Ramadier is willing to become a tool for implementing the United States' anti-Communist policy. If the Socialist Party can continue to lead the anti-Communist coalition cabinet, the United States is expected to sympathize and help it maintain economic policies such as freezing wages, curbing prices, and increasing production. Other people also said that the US attitude has been conveyed by the US Ambassador to France, Caffery, to the leaders of parties other than the Communist Party. However, it is rumored that the Communist Party may use its potential to control six million members of the trade union federation to instigate a general strike.</p>

<h3>French Labor Unions Launch Labor War Against the Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 5th Dispatch] After the French government rejected the five Communist ministers from the government, the Communist-controlled labor unions have launched a labor war against the government, and the wave of strikes and wage increase demands is spreading across the country. It is estimated that the number of strikers has reached as many as 42,000, and another 13,000 people have also proposed wage increases, and if rejected, it may also lead to strikes.</p>
<h3>The US Proposes a New Treaty on Defending the Panama Canal to Panama; the US Plans to Continue to Use Bases in Panama</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] San Francisco, 6th Dispatch: Regarding the new treaty on defending the Panama Canal, the United States has proposed to the Panamanian authorities that the new treaty stipulates that the US will continue to use military bases within the Republic of Panama. During the war, Panama provided 134 bases for the US military to use to defend the Panama Canal. After the war, 98 bases have been returned to the Panamanian authorities, and the remaining 36 bases are still used by the US military for air transport and shipping safety.</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Meeting Discusses the Situation in Madagascar</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 5th Dispatch] The French cabinet after the withdrawal of the Communist Party held its first meeting today to discuss the rebellion in Madagascar, East Africa. Acting Minister of National Defense Telbos reported that the rebellion has been brought under control, but has not yet been quelled. It was immediately decided to send infantry and air force to the island for reinforcement.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 6th Dispatch] Paris received news today that French troops and rebels are fighting in Madagascar, an island in the Indian Ocean, for more than a month. In recent days, a large-scale military operation has been launched. One hundred and fifty rebel natives have been killed, and more than one hundred have been injured. The fighting is fierce along the east coast of Madagascar and in the mountains south of Tananarive. French paratroopers are engaged in combat. The natives of Madagascar seem to be aiming at cutting off the French army's transportation lines.</p>
<h3>There Are Signs of Peace Talks Between France and Vietnam; the French Side in Saigon Denies Calling for Peace</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 5th Dispatch] It is rumored that the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Bollaert, has begun to call on both sides to resolve the conflict between France and Vietnam peacefully. This statement has been denied by responsible persons here.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th Dispatch] The French government and the Viet Minh government may begin negotiations sometime this week to end the war. A dispatch from our Saigon office revealed that the conflict in Vietnam is expected to end soon so that negotiations to resolve the dispute can be conducted in a peaceful atmosphere; a dispatch from our Paris office also said that the French government is considering the conditions for resolving the situation in Vietnam. According to reliable sources in Paris, the Viet Minh government has tentatively explored peace with the French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Bollaert, in a semi-official manner. The French government is considering the conditions for establishing a solution, and today's cabinet meeting discussed this matter. At the same time, Saigon sources said that negotiations between the French government and representatives of Ho Chi Minh's government could be held near Hanoi before the weekend, and the basis for the negotiations is still being kept secret. The sudden change in the situation in Vietnam is thought to be the result of French Army Minister Florey and Navy Minister Shekino's inspection of the military situation in northern Vietnam.</p>
<h3>British Paratroopers Search for Fugitives in the Holy City</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 5th Dispatch] After the prison break in Acre yesterday, British paratroopers continued to surround the Jewish areas near the city today. Criminal police from the police headquarters conducted a thorough investigation of all Jewish men. Officials announced that a total of 316 prisoners escaped, including 33 Jews and 183 Arabs. Twenty-nine Jewish prisoners who are still at large are convicted terrorists, and several Arab prisoners have surrendered.</p>
<h3>Eradicating Criminal Tendencies by Cutting the Prefrontal Lobe</h3>
<p>A Major Achievement in Surgery</p>
<p>[United Press, Pittsburgh, 5th Dispatch] It was learned today that the work of removing human criminal tendencies by brain surgery has now been implemented, which is a major achievement in surgery. A person named Ryder, who is accustomed to theft, is 38 years old and has a long history of criminal cases dating back to 1928. According to criminal law, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment, so he asked the Allegheny County Court for permission to voluntarily accept prefrontal lobotomy experiments. In the operating room, Dr. Koskoff performed the surgery for three hours, with a court behavioral psychiatrist monitoring it. The prefrontal lobe was separated from the rest of the brain. Today, he is radiant and healthy as usual. This type of surgery is not uncommon and has been performed repeatedly in new psychiatric institutions with considerable success. However, Ryder's case is the first to be requested by a criminal. Whether Ryder can abandon darkness and turn to the light from now on remains to be proven by future behavior.</p>
<h3>The US Will Hold Trade Week to Seek to Expand Import Trade</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] The United States will celebrate "World Trade Week" from May 18 to 24, with the purpose of expanding import trade, rather than increasing export trade, which has been the main goal of the United States' traditional trade policy. According to the most favorable forecast currently, the export of US goods may reach 11 billion US dollars in 1947, but the estimate of imported goods rarely exceeds 6 billion US dollars, which has surprised the most outstanding economists in the United States and other countries in the world. How to make up for this gap? If a remedy cannot be found, there is a risk that the situation that caused the serious global economic depression in 1929 will reappear.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Ministers Submitted Resignations Yesterday; the Date of the Cabinet's Resignation Will Be Determined by the Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The Japanese government was ordered by the Emperor on the 6th to formally convene the new parliament on May 28. Some observers believe that after the Emperor designates the date of the new parliament's convening, the cabinet may resign today.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The regular cabinet meeting of the Japanese government was still held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 6th. Prime Minister Yoshida did not attend due to illness. The meeting first resolved to convene the Diet on May 20, and then discussed the procedures for the general resignation. At this time, Cabinet Secretary-General Hayashi explained the attitude of the Yoshida cabinet regarding the general election, and then collected the resignations of the cabinet ministers, which were sent to the Foreign Minister's official residence by Sato, the Director of the Cabinet Affairs Division, and handed over to Prime Minister Yoshida. It is reported that Cabinet Secretary-General Hayashi and Cabinet Legislation Bureau Director-General Irie Shunro have also submitted their resignations to the cabinet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] Because the negotiations on the next regime have not yet matured, according to Article 70 of the new constitution, the issue of the date of the cabinet's general resignation is likely to be postponed to the date of the new Diet's convening on the 20th. Therefore, in this cabinet meeting, it was decided to leave the date of the general resignation to the Prime Minister to handle. It is said that the cabinet ministers who have submitted their resignations will still decide on their resignation date according to the Prime Minister's wishes.</p>
<h3>Seoul-Busan Railway Runs Streamlined Train</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] Korea's newest streamlined train, the "Korean Liberator," made its maiden voyage on the Seoul-Busan railway yesterday.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Members of Congress Confer on Implementing Broadcasting Plan; House Appropriations Committee Advocates Cancellation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall, Acting Secretary of State Axson, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, and important members of Congress held a meeting last night that lasted two hours to discuss the continuation of shortwave broadcasting to foreign countries. The purpose of the meeting was to obtain an appropriation of $31 million to carry out this shortwave propaganda plan. Congress hopes to cancel this. Marshall and Axson repeatedly stated at the meeting that the world is currently being poisoned by lies and propaganda, so people must be brought closer to the truth. The State Department spokesman declined to comment on the attitude of members of Congress after the meeting.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th Dispatch] The House Appropriations Committee today passed the subcommittee's recommendation to cancel the "Voice of America" broadcasting plan to the Soviet Union. Although Secretary of State Marshall said that he had asked congressional leaders to maintain this broadcasting plan, it was still ineffective. In addition, the Russian-language "America" magazine issued in the Soviet Union will also be discontinued.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber said today that the committee intends to adhere to its decision to cancel the State Department's "Voice of America" broadcast program to the Soviet Union and other broadcast programs to Europe and Asia after holding a joint meeting with Secretary of State Marshall from the government, industry, and Congress. According to current indications, Marshall will likely devote all his efforts to the debate in the Senate, as the Senate is usually easier to approve government funding than the House. Earlier, Marshall had summoned US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith back to the United States to hold a meeting with key congressional leaders to avoid Congress cutting funding and continuing to maintain the broadcasting program. Smith, who was first called back to the country on the 3rd, was the first to advocate that the State Department broadcast to the Soviet Union in Russian. Smith told about 25 senators and representatives who attended the meeting that many Soviet people had privately told him that the "Voice of America" had made a deep impression on them. According to his estimate, the Soviet Union will have 7.5 million shortwave radios in 1950. He also believes that this program is sufficient to overturn Soviet communist propaganda that accuses the United States of being militaristic and imperialistic.</p>
<h3>The Emperor of Japan Visits MacArthur</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] Emperor Hirohito, accompanied by Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, a chamberlain, and three interpreters, went to the US Embassy at 10:15 this morning to visit MacArthur and talked for an hour before leaving. This is Hirohito's fourth meeting with MacArthur since Japan's surrender, and it is also Hirohito's first meeting with MacArthur since the implementation of the new constitution on May 3, after all political privileges were stripped. According to MacArthur's spokesman, the two only discussed "routine business." However, it is generally believed that Hirohito's visit to MacArthur after his political privileges were stripped must be a mutual congratulation on Japan's entry into this new era. At the same time, the political situation after the parliamentary election is very chaotic. It is rumored among the Japanese that the Allied Headquarters may come forward to mediate so that a coalition cabinet can be established.</p>
<h3>Illegal Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; War Criminals Still Try to Defend the Generals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th, United Press Dispatch] The Tokyo International War Crimes Tribunal continued its trial today, with defense lawyers trying to absolve the Japanese Air Force of charges of illegal bombing during the so-called "China Incident." Rear Admiral Nemoto of the former Ministry of the Navy testified that the Japanese Air Force did pay attention to international air force practices and rules; he also said that although the various rules passed by the Hague Conference had not been ratified, Japan did comply with these rules during its operations in China. He also presented a document showing which targets should be bombed and which targets should be avoided. He pointed out that churches, crosses, shrines, libraries, and places unrelated to military affairs were not to be bombed. Nemoto also said that the authorities would order the Japanese Air Force to be "extremely cautious" when bombing to prevent damage to the property of third countries or their citizens. Finally, he said that deliberately bombing civilians to achieve threatening purposes was not allowed.</p>
<h3>The Last Batch of Japanese People From Taiwan Arrives in Tokyo</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th Dispatch] The last batch of 2,200 Japanese people sent back from Taiwan arrived here yesterday aboard the Tainan. When the Tainan returns to Taiwan, it will carry about 100 Taiwanese people, mostly unemployed. In total, 477,000 Japanese people have been sent back to Japan from Taiwan.</p>
<h3>Indian Racial Strife; Gandhi Blames Britain; Says British Troops Should Withdraw From India as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 5th Dispatch] Gandhi met with our reporter in Delhi today and gave a 40-minute speech. He said that although Britain's decision to withdraw from India in June next year is commendable, wouldn't it be better if Britain could withdraw immediately? Gandhi sat cross-legged. Before the reporter visited, he had continuously met with Nehru and many others, but he still showed no signs of fatigue. The reporter asked whether Britain had a moral obligation to continue to stay in India if the dispute in India had not been resolved by June 1948? Gandhi replied: It would be a good thing if Britain could withdraw immediately. Waiting another 13 months would be a disaster for India. I do not doubt the value of the British Cabinet's declaration or the sincerity of the Governor-General, but the facts are still the facts and cannot be changed by the British Cabinet or the Governor-General.</p>
<h3>The Oldest Human Bones in Europe Discovered</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hamburg, Germany, 5th Dispatch] It is reported that the bones of ancient Europeans have been discovered in the Ronaberg area, dating back to before the time of the Great Flood, which is a new discovery of human remains.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten's Report Suggested That India Be Divided; Some Military Experts Oppose</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th Dispatch] Regarding the report submitted by Governor-General Mountbatten to the British Cabinet through his advisor Ismay, political figures said that the report does not contain any specific solutions to India's current difficult situation, but includes several solutions, one of which can be chosen. One of them is to divide India into Pakistan, Hindustan, and several autonomous states of princes. These solutions will be presented to Indian leaders separately, or at a round table conference. In addition, according to some military experts, if Muslims establish Pakistan in the northwestern border area of India, India's national defense will be extremely difficult. The British government should accept the proposal of the cabinet delegation, that is, grant the Muslim League all possible rights, but maintain the unity of India in terms of diplomacy and transportation.</p>
<p>A Reliance Mentality Is Shameful</p>
<p>Today's India has been trained to rely solely on British power. This mentality will not be easy to change in a short time. In the next 13 months, all aspects of India should follow the lead of the British Cabinet and the Governor-General. Today, everyone hopes for the assistance of British military power, which is a shameful phenomenon. India does not have a system of self-government, only a system of forced acceptance by the people, so once Britain withdraws, India will inevitably fall into chaos. I believe that India's racial strife is the result of the British presence in India. If the British were not in India, we would inevitably have battles, but these battles would have allowed us to clarify ourselves. The reporter then asked what the relationship between Britain and India would be after Britain withdrew from India? He replied: If Britain can withdraw completely in good faith, Britain and India will be able to maintain the most friendly relationship.</p>
<p>The World Is Trending Towards Another Duel</p>
<p>Q: Can the United Nations maintain lasting peace? A: No one can deny that the world is trending towards another duel, but if everything in India progresses smoothly, the world will be able to have lasting peace.</p>
<h3>Stettinius Comments on the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act; Believes This Is a Negative Approach</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th Dispatch] Stettinius, a Republican presidential candidate for 1948, criticized President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey plan as a "negative" approach at a press conference today, and said that the United States should take a "positive and constructive path." We should not use money, arms, and technology to promote a full-scale military offensive against the Communist-led guerrillas in Greece, but should rely on economic plans to bring prosperity and thereby win the hearts of the people. I support the Senate's approval of the $400 million amendment to the aid to Greece and Turkey bill simply because I believe that "this is a bipartisan foreign policy issue." However, the only way to stop the internal division of Greece is to establish an effective economic system in the areas controlled by the current government, promote prosperity, and attract those who form factions to resist the government to return.</p>

<h3>The Index Will Decide to Unfreeze Wages This Month; Calculations Will Be Divided Into Eight Levels; Officials Reveal That the Current Index Is Approximately 15,000 Times</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Reliable sources said that the plan for unfreezing the cost of living index that Minister Gu Zhengcheng of the Ministry of Social Affairs negotiated with various parties in Shanghai this time is as follows: for wages below 30 yuan, all will be calculated according to the index; for those from 30 yuan to 40 yuan, a 5% discount will be applied; for those from 40 yuan to 50 yuan, another 5% discount will be added; and so on. As for the current index, although the government has not announced it, government officials revealed that it is about 15,000 times. The reporter asked both labor and management for their opinions on this plan, and the responses received were as follows: the labor side believes that a dan of white rice in January was only 100,000 yuan, and the current selling price is 300,000 yuan. The price increase of other commodities is also more than double. It is hoped that the calculation of the index can be consistent with the actual situation. Management believes that the base salary of most workers is currently between 30 yuan and 50 yuan. According to this plan, it is equivalent to no discount. The index has been frozen for four months, and once it is suddenly unfrozen, some factories are afraid that they will not be able to bear it. As for the price of factory products, it has indeed risen by more than double, and in principle, they should be able to bear it; however, the price of raw materials has risen by more than ten times, so as far as factories are concerned, there are also practical difficulties.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The central government has decided to unfreeze the cost of living index and has internally decided on four measures: (1) All industrial workers in each factory with wages below 30 yuan will be calculated according to the cost of living index. (2) Those with more than 30 yuan will be discounted level by level, divided into the following eight levels: 1. 31 yuan to 45 yuan, 2. 46 yuan to 60 yuan, 3. 61 yuan to 90 yuan, 4. 91 yuan to 120 yuan, 5. 121 yuan to 150 yuan, 6. 151 yuan to 180 yuan, 7. 181 yuan to 210 yuan, 8. 211 yuan and above. Each of the above eight levels will be discounted, and the higher the level, the smaller the discount, but the difference in the discount is not very large. (3) After the index is unfrozen, if the employer is indeed unable to bear it, the labor and management can negotiate separately and re-establish the standard for issuing wages, and report it to the competent authorities for record. (4) The implementation date of this measure will begin this month. (That is, the index must be unfrozen this month). The above four measures will be implemented after the highest authorities make a final approval, so the unfreezing of the cost of living index can be realized within this month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The competent authorities have decided on the principle of unfreezing the cost of living index. However, this issue involves the provisions of the emergency economic measures plan passed by the Supreme National Defense Council on February 16, and the various technical issues after the unfreezing and the possible impacts are of great importance. The Ministry of Social Affairs is currently studying it carefully with all parties. It is heard that the detailed measures will be announced within ten days. It is heard that for employees with wages below 30 yuan, their wages will be issued according to the cost of living index. Those with more than 30 yuan will be divided into several levels and issued according to the discount on the cost of living index. At the same time, the existing differential gold method will be cancelled.</p>

<h3>Pan Da Appeals Death Sentence; Vehemently Denies Presiding Over Assassinations; Provides Detailed Information on the Organization of "76"</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Da was charged with suspicion of being a traitor. The High Court sentenced him to death on August 19 last year. Pan refused to accept the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court instructed the original trial to conduct a detailed investigation on the so-called "Shanghai Evil Bully" and the creation of terrorist incidents in Shanghai, and whether the defendant had the right to directly direct this action, especially whether there was solid evidence to convince the defendant. The original judgment was revoked and returned for retrial. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday. Pan wore a gray striped suit and tea crystal glasses when he appeared in court, and his attitude was quite calm. He vehemently denied the accusations in the indictment that he had presided over the assassination incidents in Shanghai, saying that the assassinations of Wu Gengshu and Xu Tianmin of the Hollywood Casino were committed by Qian Renlong, the deputy director of the Pseudo Fourth Division. The terrorist acts in the Shanghai Concession during the period of the fall were directly directed by Ding Mocun and Li Shiqun, and he described in detail the organizational situation in "76", saying that it was divided into four divisions, three offices, four groups, and two teams. The functions of the four divisions were: the first division was in charge of general affairs, the second division was in charge of intelligence and trials, the third division was in charge of telecommunications, and the fourth division was in charge of foreign affairs. He had served as the director of the fourth division, and his work was to contact police officers in the concession and negotiate with the concession authorities on the establishment of a pseudo special police station in the cross-border road construction. After repeated questioning by Judge Xiao, the trial lasted for an hour, and it was announced that the trial would be adjourned to a later date because further investigation was needed.</p>
<h3>Xu Jidun Applies for Review; Obvious Evidence of Crimes Rejected</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Jidun was suspected of being a traitor, and the High Court sentenced him to ten years of imprisonment, ten years of deprivation of civil rights, and confiscation of his property in accordance with the law. Xu refused to accept the sentence and applied to the Supreme Court for review. The Supreme Court has now issued a special judgment No. 927, "The original judgment is approved." The reasons are briefly as follows: "The defendant served as the director of the General Education Department of the Pseudo Ministry of Education in April of the 29th year, increasing the Japanese language course. In September of the same year, he was transferred to the Pseudo Zhejiang Provincial Education Department. In the 34th year, he was transferred to the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Bureau, and then changed to the Construction Bureau, and he continued to be re-elected, assuming actual responsibility, and his crimes of colluding with the enemy are obvious. The original trial sentenced the defendant to ten years of imprisonment because he surrendered himself, which is not inappropriate. The evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to be adopted, so the original judgment is approved, and the defendant's application is rejected."</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Announces Details of Student-Police Conflict</h3>
<p>On "May Fourth" at Noon, Shanghai Law School Students Had a Conflict with Police Due to Posting Slogans</p>
<p>The police bureau spokesman announced the handling of the case as follows:</p>
<p>On "May Fourth" at noon, Li Shuxi, Lin Ziqiu, Pan Sicai, and Gu Qianji, students of the Law School, pasted slogans on the glass windows of the Free Press on Shanyin Road. Police officer No. 6163 Guo Jiaxiang was ordered to ban it and politely dissuaded them, but to no avail. Before long, two trucks loaded with about 200 students surrounded Officer Guo, and a conflict immediately broke out. Officer Guo fled to the desk in the Free Press, but the students still chased and beat him, causing Officer Guo to be seriously injured. Later, Zhao, a staff member of the North Sichuan Road Branch, received the news and rescued him, and rushed the police officer to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, students Li Shuxi and others claimed to have been beaten by Officer Guo. The police bureau believed that the fact that Officer Guo was beaten and injured was clear, and the right and wrong had been clarified. However, considering that these students were all young people, or were reckless for a while, the police handed over the students who committed the crime to Chu Fengyi, the president of the Law School, to take back. However, since the case involved injury, the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>According to the police bureau spokesman, "On the morning of 'May Fourth' at 7:30, Zhu Huiliang and other students of Guanghua University pasted slogans opposing the government's policies in the area of Haining Road on North Sichuan Road. The branch in charge ordered the shops to scrub them off and seized 140 of these slogans. Yesterday at noon, ten student representatives from Guanghua University went to the general bureau to request an explanation. After being dispatched to explain the handling process, the representatives expressed their satisfaction and left the bureau.</p>

<h3>Relatives of Victims of the Zhongya Ship Disaster Request Auction of Motor Sailboat</h3>
<p>Gather at the Maritime Administration Bureau; A Dispute</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhongya ship of the Zhongya Shipping Company was burned on the Yangtze River Zhangjiazhou River in early March of this year. More than 100 crew members and passengers were killed. The company only had this one ship, and it was unable to handle it after the accident, so it closed down, so that the families of the victims had no way to obtain compensation. Later, it was learned that the owner of the company, Jin Fuya, had another motor sailboat named Jinya. The relatives of the victims detained it, intending to auction it off and use the proceeds as compensation. At about 3:00 p.m. yesterday, male and female family members of the crew members went to the Maritime Administration Bureau to request recognition of the auction. The bureau was located on the second floor of the China Merchants Bureau on Guangdong Road Bund. At that time, there were twenty or thirty people, who rushed upstairs. The guard saw this and tried to stop them, causing a conflict. Fortunately, Zhu caused the disaster. Then the family members mistakenly believed that it was ordered by the Maritime Administration Bureau, so they negotiated with the bureau. After persuasion, they dispersed. The transfer of the motor sailboat has also been approved, and a disturbance has subsided.</p>
<h3>Four District Administrative Symposiums; Thugs Snatching Goods, Pushing Carts for Extortion; Bad Phenomena to Be Improved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Municipal Councilor Pan convened the chiefs and deputy chiefs of Hongkou, Zhabei, North Station, and North Siping Road districts and the chairmen of the district people's congresses yesterday morning to hold a district administrative symposium. In addition to general issues such as funding, awareness, shantytowns, and garbage, the representatives also raised several issues that they hoped to improve: (1) North Tibet Road and Anqing Road are important transportation hubs. It is hoped that the Municipal Public Works Bureau will repair them as soon as possible, and the North Zhejiang Road Bridge will be opened. (2) Organized thugs specialize in snatching goods from trucks and vans. When rickshaws and tricycles go up and down the bridge, a large number of street children use pushing the cart as a pretext to extort in every possible way, which is very annoying to passengers. On both sides of the road, refugees eat in the wind and sleep in the open. All these phenomena affect order and appearance, but the police turn a blind eye, and the competent authorities do not try to accommodate them. This problem is really worth paying attention to. (3) It is hoped that the district chief and the autonomous personnel below the district will increase their salaries and implement year-end bonuses. (4) It is hoped that one household registration cadre will be assigned to each Bao, and Bao Ding will be restored.</p>

<h3>Enemy and Pseudo Real Estate Re-Evaluated in Two Weeks; Register Tenants; Then Sell by Tender</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the handling of enemy and pseudo real estate in Shanghai, the Central Trust Bureau is scheduled to start re-evaluating in two weeks, and at the same time register tenants, and then sell by tender.

<h3>Cracking Down on Counterfeit Japanese Medicine; Principal Offenders Captured; Fake Medicine Worth 500 Million; Haining Pharmacy Investigated for Purchase</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Chief Kuai of the North Sichuan Road Police Branch received a book report at about 4:00 p.m. one day, saying that someone was counterfeiting Japanese Western medicine in No. 83, Lane 50, Kulun Road. Deputy Branch Chief Wang Jianxin was ordered to go to the address with Criminal Section Chief Wu Zhenxiong and staff member Cai Yanzuo to search.

All the decorations, boxes, trademarks, and medicine bottles were almost genuine. The principal offenders, husband and wife, were taken to the bureau for interrogation along with the fake drugs. According to the confession: Song Hanzhong, 29 years old, from Haimen, engaged in business. His wife, Guan Jizhen, was of the same age and from the same hometown. They admitted to manufacturing fake drugs and selling them under false pretenses. All duties such as purchasing raw materials, manufacturing, and selling were performed by their accomplice Chen Jinrong. His nephew Xiao Gen was responsible for washing bottles and other chores. Song was only responsible for packaging and other matters. Last month, Song had manufactured two kinds of Wanyou and Jiesiji Er by himself, but all the medicine bottles and signs were also handled by Chen Jinrong. In addition to the 50 boxes of Wanyou potion that Chen had sold, the Jiesiji Er he made was sold to Haining Pharmacy at No. 233 Haining Road last month. A police officer was sent to the store under the guise of buying various brands of Japanese medicine. As a result, four boxes of Xinhua Linzong and Wanli Airilisheng and two boxes of Jiesihai Er were found in the store. The owner, Yu Jixiang, was summoned to the bureau. It was learned that he and Song had worked together at Bailing Pharmacy on Dazha Road before the war. Recently, Song brought Jiesiji Er to the store for sale. Because they were in the same industry, he did not suspect anything else. The rest of the drugs were bought from customs auctions. After questioning Song Guan Jizhen, they denied participating in the work. The case has been investigated, and all the defendants will be sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial today. According to the police officer in charge of the case, if all the fake drugs seized are sold, it is estimated that they can earn about 500 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Two Cases of Rice Hoarding Transferred to Court; Commander Xuan Speaks on Hiding Rice and Refusing to Sell; Decides to Order Military and Police to Investigate and Handle Strictly</h3>
<p>The Economic Section of the Police Bureau recently received a tip that Fu Xing Gong Rice Store at No. 269 Dajing Road in the Southern District was refusing to sell rice sold by the Social Bureau and hiding it in the stack of Dazhong Oil Shop at No. 263 next door, while selling it at black market prices. They immediately sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and found that the store still had twelve shi of white japonica rice (not rice sold by the Social Bureau), fourteen shi of Saigon rice, and four shi of Baiyuan rice, all of which they refused to sell. When questioned, the store owner Yan Jiasheng claimed that the store had been taking orders from various customers since last year, and about fifty shi had not yet been delivered, so the stored rice was prepared for customers to pick up. Police officers ordered Yan Jia[sheng] to sign a guarantee.</p>
<p>Continuing to Dazhong Oil Shop, they found 50 shi of rice inside. According to the shop owner Gu Zhongshan, some of the rice was purchased and stored by Tian Fu Xing Gong Rice Store, and the other part was sent by Ma Qiao Yongfeng Flower Factory for storage, but there was no evidence. Gu Zhongshan was also ordered to sign a guarantee. The Police Bureau reported this case to Commander Xuan for handling. Yesterday, the order was received: "Immediately arrest the persons in charge of each store and send them to the court for investigation." Yesterday, the manager of Dazhong Oil Shop, Gu Zhongshan, and the business director of Fu Xing Gong Rice Store, Sun Rungen, were summoned to the bureau, temporarily detained for investigation, and will be transferred to the court soon.</p>

The detailed plan is currently being drafted. Once implemented, the price of food will naturally fall. If rice merchants arbitrarily raise market prices or hide rice and refuse to sell it during this period, creating artificial panic, the military and police will be ordered to strictly investigate and handle it. If unscrupulous elements lurking in the city secretly incite the masses, stir up trouble, and disrupt public order, they will also be severely punished. It is hoped that the government and the people will work together to ensure the peace of this city.</p>

<h3>Social Services; Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Cuckoo Occupying the Nest</p>
<p>Wu Zhiping asks: A relative, Mr. A, has a shop that he produced himself. In 1936, it was rented to Mr. B. There was no lease agreement, and no witnesses. Both parties stated that Mr. A could take it back at any time if he wanted to use it himself. In 1941, Mr. A passed away, and the rent was collected by his wife, Mrs. C. In 1943, Mr. A's son (Mr. D) came of age and wanted to take it back for his own use. He notified Mr. B and asked him to move out within three months. Mr. B agreed. After three months, Mr. B said it was difficult to find a house, so Mrs. C agreed to extend the deadline by three months. After another three months, Mrs. C asked Mr. B to move out again, but Mr. B broke his promise and insisted on staying. Therefore, Mrs. C has refused to accept rent since the autumn of 1943, which is now three years. Questions: (1) Since Mrs. C's shop is indeed for her own use, can she take it back? (2) Since she has not collected rent for three years, can Mrs. C sue Mr. B for forcible occupation? (3) Since Mrs. C has considerable proof that she wants to take it back for her own use, can she make Mr. B move out?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) If Mrs. C's shop is indeed for her own use, she can take it back from Mr. B in accordance with Article 100, Paragraph 1 of the Land Law. (2) Not collecting rent for three years is different from owing rent. Before the lease agreement between the two parties is legally terminated, there is no issue of forcible occupation. Mrs. C cannot sue Mr. B for forcibly occupying the house. (3) Since Mrs. C has considerable proof that she wants to take it back for her own use, she can sue in court, requesting a judgment ordering Mr. B to move out.</p>
<p>(2) Debt Litigation</p>
<p>Ding Quan asks: (1) The law stipulates that the right to sue is for fifteen years, but should the eight years of the war be deducted from the calculation? Also, if one defendant is in the interior and the other is in the occupied area, how should the lawsuit be handled? (2) After ten years have passed since the pre-war debt, can a request be made to increase it by a certain amount? (3) Now that the defendant is in Shanghai and the plaintiff is in Changzhou, can the lawsuit be filed in Changzhou?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) If the period for exercising rights stipulated in the Civil Code or other laws could not be observed due to the war, the rights can still be exercised within two years after the implementation of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Recovery (this regulation was implemented on February 18, 1945). However, if the original period is shorter than two years, the rights can only be exercised within six months after the implementation of the regulation (see Article 7 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation after Recovery). (2) According to the law, it is indeed possible to request the court to increase the payment of pre-war debts, but the standard for increasing the payment should be fairly determined by the court. (3) Article 24 of the Civil Procedure Law stipulates that "the parties may agree on a court of first instance, but only for lawsuits arising from a certain legal relationship," and "the aforementioned agreement must be evidenced in writing."</p>

<h3>In the Great Era of the End of the Eight-Year War of Resistance, How to Be a Nation-Building Youth (Continued from the 5th)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jixi</p>
<p>Training in Scientific Knowledge</p>
<p>Third, to be a nation-building youth, we must have scientific knowledge. The world today is a scientific world. The power of science is enough to determine everything in the world. The Second World War, which raged across the globe, was due to Germany's scientific weapons, such as seventy-ton tanks and magnetic mines, which highlighted Hitler's ferocity and once dominated Europe for a time. If Britain had not had new anti-tank guns and the invention of depth charges and magnetic mine destroyers at the time, could it have turned danger into safety and defeat into victory? Until August of the previous year, when the two atomic bombs invented by the United States first showed their power in Japan, they forced millions of Japanese imperial troops, who had been rampaging in East Asia, to submit. The Japanese Emperor, trembling, led tens of millions of his subjects to declare unconditional surrender to us, thus ending the nearly ten-year bloody war that had swept the globe. Is this not the power of science, the decisive battle of science? Therefore, to build a strong country and survive in this scientific world, we must develop science. To develop our country's science, our country must have thousands of times more scientific workers than it currently has; and most of their work must be world-class. When there are so many scientific workers and such good results, and when scientific methods can be widely applied to solve various life problems, then science can take root and live in China. Only when this level is achieved can our economy, our politics, and our society have a solid foundation. Young friends, whether we are willing to do practical or theoretical work, there are countless interesting and important problems in science, from mathematics to biology, waiting for us to solve. Young friends who love science, for the sake of nation-building, we must bring science deep into the countryside and the border areas, and sow the seeds of science in poor and remote areas, in the vast border areas, and in the eyes and hearts of our 470 million compatriots, so that from the Heilongjiang River in the northeast to the foothills of the Himalayas in the southwest, and throughout the Chinese society, the economy, and the politics, are filled with the seeds of science, sprouting new shoots of science, blooming with the flowers of science, and bearing the fruits of science. Young friends who love science, let us mobilize together, devote ourselves to scientific research, engage in scientific construction, and build a scientific, modern, new China.</p>
<p>Cultivating a Democratic Spirit</p>
<p>Fourth, to be a nation-building youth, we must have democratic cultivation. The important meaning of democracy is to be law-abiding and to obey the public will of the majority and to abide by the laws and regulations of the state and society. The general public in our country can be said to lack democratic cultivation. Therefore, in everything, they often fail to obey the public will and abide by the laws and regulations, resulting in chaos throughout the country and society. As we approach the eve of constitutional government, we must naturally move towards the road of democracy and pay attention to democratic cultivation. Young students are the vanguard of the people and the elite of the nation, so their every word and deed should be a model for the general public, and they should pay special attention to democratic cultivation, leading the general public towards the open road of democratic constitutionalism. There are indeed many young students who can do this, but there are also not a few who lack democratic cultivation and, under the guise of democracy and freedom, do things that violate the law and disrupt discipline. Recently, it has been heard from time to time that young students in various places have stirred up troubles due to minor matters, attacked newspaper offices and shops, and even used strikes as a weapon. This is completely contrary to democracy. Because democracy is about obeying the public will and respecting public opinion; newspapers are originally the mouthpiece of the people, speaking for the people, so how can newspaper offices be destroyed? Is this not a barbaric act of destroying public opinion and betraying democracy? As for minor matters that occur within the school, they can be resolved through legal means and judged by public opinion and reason. Why is it necessary to incite unrest and even strikes? Young students have a duty to study, and parents and the country expect them to succeed in their studies and benefit the country and society, so they spare no expense to run schools every year. Now, to strike over minor matters is to deceive oneself and others, to harm oneself and the country, to abandon one's studies, and to destroy the country's future? Young students, for the sake of protecting your studies and cherishing the country's future, you must not engage in suicidal acts such as strikes again. On the contrary, you must use legal procedures, express the public will, and use the sanctions of public opinion: in a negative sense, eliminate the troublemakers and lawbreakers who harm the group within the school; in a positive sense, organize various academic research associations and engage in various group activities in a law-abiding manner to cultivate a democratic spirit, promote democratic cultivation, and then guide the public to practice local self-government, prepare for the implementation of constitutional government, and build a new China with democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Young friends, we are living in this great era of nation-building, which comes once in a thousand years, and we should shoulder the historical mission of nation-building, forge a strong physique, cultivate a noble personality, train good scientific knowledge, and possess democratic cultivation. Then, with the spirit of "establishing oneself and establishing others, achieving oneself and achieving others," we can build a strong and democratic modern new Republic of China.

<p>Representatives nominated by the Export and Import Associations to study and submit opinions to the National Economic Commission for reference</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held its ninth consecutive meeting on May 3rd, 5th, and 6th. Chairman Zhang Jia'ao introduced Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu. Attendees also included committee members Liu Gongyun, Jin Shixuan, Ren Sida, Shen Xirui, consultants Li Rui, McGrath, Payne, Chen Junren, director of the Shenyang office, Mai Zuoheng, director of the Guangzhou office, secretaries Fang Shangui, Zhang Xu, and Shao Zhenhua of the National Bank Business Bureau, and many others.

<h3>Rice Boats Detained, Scarcity of Goods Arriving; Grain Merchants Ask Mayor for Protection; White Rice Retail Price Exceeds 300,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The rice rush spread from Hangzhou to Wuxi, and rice merchants were afraid of their rice being robbed, so they mostly hesitated to move forward. Local governments along the way also made things difficult for rice merchants from Shanghai who went to the production areas to transport rice. Ten rice boats destined for Shanghai were detained between Qingpu and Huangdu a few days ago.</p>
<p>Shanghai rice merchants, concerned that the detention of rice would affect transportation and the overall food supply for the city, sent Qu Zhenhua, Cha Baosan, and Xu Songren to visit Mayor Wu yesterday morning to ask him to find a way to solve this difficulty. Mayor Wu promised to immediately telegraph the garrison headquarters to send personnel to protect the rice merchants in the production areas and to ask the local authorities not to make things difficult for them. They also telegraphed to request the release of the ten detained rice boats.</p>
<p>White Rice Creates New Record</p>
<p>The amount of goods arriving at the North and South markets yesterday was still scarce, totaling 668.6 dan. Because the market has resumed free trading and river goods have also joined the trade, the actual transaction volume was more than 5,000 dan. The asking price for white rice was 270,000 yuan for the Chang Gang and 300,000 yuan for the Xi Gang. The retail price was even higher than this, all setting new records.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau still sold 9,000 bags of white rice yesterday. The South Market sold 4,500 bags, and the North Market only purchased 4,320 bags. Another 180 bags were not purchased. In the past, because of the small amount of allocated rice, many citizens lined up to buy it, which often caused disputes, so they were afraid to register. The rice shops now plan to concentrate the allocated rice for each district in one place for sale and send personnel from each rice shop to jointly assist in handling it.</p>
<p>Rice to Be Rationed to Workers and Students</p>
<p>Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has soared and it is not easy to buy. In order to stabilize the food supply, the Social Affairs Bureau has reportedly formulated temporary emergency measures to implement rice rationing. According to reporters, the measures stipulate that factory workers, public and private university students, and secondary school students will have their names and national ID numbers submitted by the factories and schools to the bureau for verification and allocation of two dou of rice per person per month. In poor areas, the bureau will set up public rice sales offices for the poor in conjunction with the district police stations and district offices. Poor people in each district can purchase rice from the public sales office with their household registration certificates and all ID cards of the household. It is reported that the temporary emergency measures are being submitted to the central government for approval and are expected to be implemented in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Foreign Rice to Arrive Within Days</p>
<p>The foreign rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau continues to arrive. On the 5th, 2,000 tons of Siamese rice were transported by the Hai Xia ship. Another 6,800 tons of Siamese rice were loaded by the Yangon Chongxing ship on the 3rd and will arrive within days.</p>
<h3>Rising Prices of Flour and Grains</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Edible oil prices rose and then fell yesterday, with closing prices for all vendors ending up about 10,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Our factory's soybean oil was 590,000 yuan, common barrel cooked vegetable oil was 575,000 yuan, basket crude oil was 570,000 yuan, small cart sesame oil was 600,000 yuan, and auspicious barrel crude oil was 615,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour, grains, and bean cake prices all held firm yesterday. Imported flour was 160,000 yuan, Wu flour was 110,000 yuan, and bran was 83,500 yuan, an increase of about 10,000 yuan. Dalian yuan beans were 190,000 yuan, Dalian green beans were 188,000 yuan, Pinghu Du beans were 235,000 yuan, and Chongming sand yellow peas were 185,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of various grades of raw peanuts rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Qinhuangdao raw peanuts were 345,000 yuan, Jiujiang raw peanuts were 320,000 yuan, Kaifeng raw peanuts were 330,000 yuan, Qingdao raw peanuts were 360,000 yuan, and Yingkou raw peanuts were 355,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cakes also increased by several thousand yuan each. Shengji bean cake was 60,000 yuan, Renji bean cake was 60,500 yuan, Yuanlong bean cake was 60,000 yuan, Lizi bean cake was 61,000 yuan, Jianzi bean cake was 59,500 yuan, Yuji bean cake was 62,000 yuan, and Ying bean cake was 98,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Agreement Reached in Price Negotiations, Meeting to Resume Today</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The edible oil and flour price negotiation committees met separately in the afternoon of the day before yesterday and yesterday at the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Relevant parties from both industries attended, but no agreement was reached after discussions.</p>
<p>It is heard that the production costs proposed by the factories were calculated based on the raw material costs in Shanghai. Therefore, the calculated costs were still above the current black market prices. For our factory's soybean oil, calculated with Dalian soybeans at 185,000 yuan per "zu" (unit), the production cost of soybean oil proposed by the factory was 770,000 yuan per "dan" (unit).</p>
<p>For flour, calculated with wheat at 170,000 yuan per "dan", the production cost of flour proposed by the factory was 113,900 yuan per bag, which is higher than the current black market prices. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau instructed the merchants to re-examine ways to reduce costs. It is reported that people from the flour industry are scheduled to meet today to provide the lowest possible production cost of flour.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Bank Offers Tea Loans Based on Three Principles</h3>
<p>Tea merchants believe that the tea loans offered by the Chinese Farmers Bank are too restrictive and have requested relaxation. According to the person in charge of the bank, the tea loans are based on three principles: first, to guide funds into production; second, to reduce costs; and third, to increase production speed. The total tea production for this year is estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 "dan". However, to date, over 1,600 tea merchants and tea factories have applied for loans from the bank. Their total estimated output is over 1.5 million "dan". Some of this may be inaccurate. Therefore, the bank stipulates that only tea merchants who can produce 300 "dan" of green tea or 100 "dan" of black tea can apply for loans. Also, to take into account production speed, the merchants must first purchase raw tea at cost, and then the bank will provide tea loans for repackaging and marketing. Tea merchants with small production volumes can apply for loans jointly, but no loans will be granted to tea merchants who do not meet the production requirements. Currently, loans are only being issued in Qimen, while other areas are still under production volume review.</p>
<h3>Increased Special Certificates to be Submitted, Chinese Stocks' Rise Slightly Weakened, Still a Few Limit-Up Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks experienced a sudden rebound later yesterday. There was a rumor that 30% more special certificates would be collected for the next submission, and the market sentiment gradually cracked. However, China Silk and New Asia still stood firm at the limit-up price with environmental support, with many buyers still interested.</p>
<p>In the morning, Meiya and Wuhe opened at the limit-up price, while the other stocks saw mixed fortunes. After the opening of Diyi Spinning, stocks 224, 91, 188, 197, 129, 231, and 65 all advanced. China Silk, Commerce, and Cement also all rose to the limit. Diyi Spinning then rose to 6,900 yuan. Stocks 207, 223, 129, and 94 were sold, retreating to 6,850 yuan. Stocks 91, 180, 149, 184, 129, 145, 219, 97, and 28 showed strong momentum, rising to 6,970 yuan. New Asia also announced a limit-up, and stocks 231, 153, 155, 4, 232, and 23 were liquidated at high prices, falling to 6,830 yuan. Afterward, the trend turned to hesitation. After 10:40, foreign stocks suddenly became popular, and stocks 145, 219, 105, 16, 180, 117, 153, 12, 199, 219, 76, and 62 collectively purchased, and scattered short positions were also covered, pushing Diyi Spinning to 7,100 yuan. Stocks 145, 153, 183, 94, 60, 89, 213, and 162 unloaded, retreating to 6,720 yuan. The reason was the sudden rumor of a 30% increase in special certificates. After that, the situation was chaotic. Stocks 91 and 222 were bought, while stocks 94, 36, and 207 were sold. At noon, there was a major struggle around 6,880 yuan. However, after the close, stock 185 and others covered, and the quoted price rose to above 6,920 yuan, and the off-site quotations were high, resulting in an inverted yield curve. As a result, compared with the previous close, Diyi Spinning rose by half a percent, Meiya rose by slightly less than 10%, Xinhuo, Qinxing, and Yonggong rose slightly, Huafeng was flat, and Xinguang, Jingfu, and Xinhua declined slightly. In the delivery market, Meiya rose by slightly less than 10%, Qinxing was flat, Xinguang and Yonggong fell slightly, and Diyi Spinning, Xinhuo, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose slightly. Among the inactive stocks, New Asia, Wuhe, China Silk, and Commerce reached the limit up, Cement and Rongfeng retreated after reaching the limit up, rising by less than 10%, Jinglun and China Textile fell by half a percent, Match and Datong had small gains, and the rest generally fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, due to news of continued reductions in Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraph charges, market sentiment recovered. Stocks 215 and 196 both saw slight gains. China Silk, Meiya, Commerce, and New Asia still reached the limit up. Diyi Spinning saw a high price of 7,060 yuan before falling. Stocks 49, 152, 97, 179, 183, 153, 4, and 47 were sold in succession, retreating to 6,850 yuan. Stocks 224, 199, and 100 advanced to around 6,950 yuan. Stocks 223, 160, 2, 22, 145, 77, 213, 89, 160, 154, 85, 105, 31, Ersi, and 153 were liquidated, resulting in an oversupply, retreating to 6,540 yuan. Stocks 77, 173, 97, Jiwu, and 215 took advantage of the low prices to gain, and the market stabilized near the close, with quoted prices rising to above 6,700 yuan after the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Diyi Spinning did not trade in the afternoon, Xinhuo rose slightly, Huadian declined slightly, Xinguang, Yonggong, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by slightly more than half a percent, Xinhua fell by 10%, and Meiya reached the limit up. In the delivery market, Diyi Spinning, Xinhuo, and Jingfu fell slightly, Huafeng, Yonggong, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qin and each fell by half a percent, and Xiya retreated after reaching the limit up, still rising by half a percent.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that the government has already transferred the principal and interest of the US dollar bond portion of the fund, amounting to over 55 million yuan in foreign exchange funds, to the New Bond Fund Custodian Committee. The principal and interest of the short-term treasury bill portion of the fund will be allocated to the Custodian Committee after the designated state-owned enterprises and enemy and puppet properties are processed.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Fund Custodian Committee is scheduled to hold its third meeting at 4:00 PM today at the Bank Association Building. The main agenda item is to discuss the internal operating rules of the committee.</p>
<h3>Wang Longsheng Talks About the Tung Oil Export Crisis After Returning from Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Rampant Smuggling, Hong Kong Inventory Overflowing</p>
<p>The China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to increase tung oil production and expand storage and refining facilities, sent its manager Wang Longsheng to Hunan and Hubei two weeks ago for an on-site investigation. Wang has now returned to Shanghai and stated that with overseas tung oil prices currently low, we must not only actively step up production, but also prioritize improving quality, reducing costs, and strengthening refining and storage facilities. The lack of storage facilities for tung oil merchants in Hunan and Hubei is the most pressing issue. The purpose of my trip was both to increase the factory's oil refining output and to serve the merchants by transporting goods from the producing areas to ships via pipelines and storing them in iron containers to save manpower and reduce consumption. After more than ten days of planning, this will be realized in the near future. For our factory's oil refining operations, the Hankou factory can refine 1,500 tons per month with storage capacity of 5,000 tons. Changsha and Changde can refine 2,000 tons with storage of 1,500 tons. Yichang can refine and store 1,000 tons each. With sound storage facilities, merchants can wait and see even if overseas market prices are temporarily depressed and sell when the price is right. Wang believes that the tung oil market price in Hankou is stable, and there is no shortage of inventory. There will be no problem even if large quantities are purchased. Smuggling is no longer easy. The facilities set up by the Transport Control Commission in South China have been quite effective. Hunan Province had a pre-war annual tung oil production of 35,000 tons. Due to wartime military unrest, production has decreased to about 20,000 tons. It is estimated that about 5,000 tons have been shipped out so far. There are also about 5,000 tons for domestic sales of "xiu" oil and "hong" oil. The remaining amount has been smuggled to Hong Kong to obtain black market foreign exchange. The routes are divided into Changsha and Changde. The actual amount of smuggling cannot be estimated at this time. However, for legitimate merchants transporting oil from Changsha to Hong Kong, including transportation costs, the resulting exchange rate back to the origin for purchasing goods has to be discounted by 40%. Conversely, the profits of smugglers are doubled. As a result, smuggling is rampant on the Hunan-Guangxi road, and Hong Kong's inventory is overflowing, creating a state of mutual undercutting. Prices are falling one after another, and foreign merchants are threatened by unstable prices, and their demand is sluggish. These are all internal crises of the tung oil market. As for external reasons, according to statistics after March, the United States imported about 20,000 tons of stored oil from China. Before the war, the United States' tung oil production was only about 7,000 tons per year. Now, it is accelerating the improvement of tung tree planting and oil extraction, which can increase to 10,000 tons. Its cost is less than two cents of a US dollar per pound. New inventions, such as the use of hard castor oil substitutes, also cost only two and a half cents of a US dollar, which is a strong competitor to China's export tung oil.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tea Market Active, Prices Up 20-30% From Previous</h3>
<p>The various types of domestic tea that had been quiet for a long time saw a resurgence in the market yesterday due to a sudden surge in demand from Tianjin merchants. Initially, prices were stable, but later they spread like wildfire and became uncontrollable. As a result, the 35th-year Shanghui roasted tea soared from 350,000 yuan to 420,000-430,000 yuan per "zu". At the same time, flower Dafang tea jumped to around 800,000 yuan per "zu". Other teas, such as Zhulan tea, climbed to the high point of 1 million per "dan", an increase of 20-30% from the previous, and their positions were consolidated. Other varieties saw only sporadic sales, and the situation remained deadlocked. The foreign tea market was sluggish due to the narrow demand from buyers and the stalemate in negotiations, so trade remained difficult to boost and prices were unusually volatile. It is reported that there is currently a strong demand for tea in Europe, but due to price issues, it is difficult to export smoothly for the time being. The Xinhua Tea Company's foreign trade department will send personnel to Shanghai to inspect the actual situation of the tea market to facilitate the future export of Chinese tea.</p>

<h3>Distribution to Civil Servants and Teachers Expected to Begin Mid-Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The summer cloth distributed by the China Textile Construction Company to civil servants and teachers, consisting of two bolts of khaki and bleached cloth, has long been in preparation and is now ready. In Shanghai, it was originally scheduled to begin on the 5th of this month at the company's second retail store at 525 Jinling Road. The Civil Servants and Teachers' Distribution Items Review Committee has decided that the distribution will be based on the staff numbers of various civil service and education agencies in April. The list is currently being compiled. To facilitate the collection of cloth and avoid excessive congestion, the Textile Construction Company plans to send letters to the various agencies after receiving the list, arranging a scheduled date for them to collect the cloth money they are supposed to pay, and bring an official letter to the retail store to pay the money and collect the cloth. It is expected that the market will open and sales will begin around the middle of the month.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Plans to Engage in Barter Trade with the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, May 5] In order to promote the sales of special products within the province, the Fujian Provincial Chamber of Commerce plans to engage in barter trade with the Northeast, exchanging Fujian tea and paper for Northeast soybeans and bean cakes. Cai Youlan, chairman of the chamber, has consulted with the Northeast Executive Headquarters, and an agreement in principle has been reached.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Bank's New Building Completed</h3>
<p>Xinhua Trust &amp; Savings Bank in this city, due to the expansion of its business, the original site was insufficient for application.

It has now been renovated and will move to the new site for business on May 12.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a soft trend due to the hope of the resumption of distribution by the Taiwan Company. Peruvian fine granulated sugar was initially 420,000 yuan, then 25,000 yuan, and finally returned to 19,000 yuan, a decrease of over 10,000 yuan. There were no changes in 24 coarse white sugar, 20 medium granulated sugar was at a small loss of 15,000 yuan, and car white sugar fluctuated little. Shantou green sugar maintained its original price due to few sales. Daoqing sugar fell by a small amount of 4,000-5,000 yuan, from 250,000 yuan to 246,000 yuan, with about 300 parcels traded. Xinghua white sugar ranged from 410,000 yuan to 395,000 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar was at a small loss of 5,000 yuan, ranging from 300,500 yuan to 290,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Industry Surges Again</h3>
<p>The tobacco industry has been greatly boosted this year due to blocked routes and scarce goods on the market, and the recent surge has been particularly strong. Qingzhou medium-grade tobacco leaves are quoted at 15,000 yuan per pound, Xuzhou at 14,000 yuan, and Fengyang, Xinchang, and Sidu leaves are also rising in step.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to a tobacco merchant from Hangzhou yesterday, there are very few Sidu tobacco leaves left in the production area, and Shanghai merchants are flocking to purchase them. Each 112-pound package of loose leaves has risen to 800,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals Rise</h3>
<p>Since January, metal prices have been stimulated by the rise in the black market exchange rate and have been rising almost every day. The recent rise has been even sharper, and market sentiment is stronger than ever. Yesterday, people's head sanding cloth, copper pipes, and galvanized iron pipes saw the most severe price increases. Imported nails also rose by about 10%.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the China Stock Yearbook</h3>

<h3>Boundless Spring Scenery on the Seine, A Picturesque View of Parisian Streets</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Paris Airmail, April 25th</p>
<p>The twenty-five short miles of the Strait of Dover separate two great European powers, turning them into two different worlds. This body of water not only divides two nations with distinctly different national characters, but also separates completely different climates and geographical advantages. In late spring, while London is still shrouded in heavy fog and seldom sees the sun, Paris is already a boundless vista of spring colors.</p>
<p>Anyone who has visited Paris will never forget this global city of flowers. The grandeur of the Arc de Triomphe, the flat, orderly, and tree-lined boulevards, the weeping willows along the Seine, the spaciousness of the Place de la Concorde, the elegant Eiffel Tower, and even the quaint charm of the Latin Quarter all leave an indelible impression. The French cherish beauty, art, and the appreciation of the joys of life. Therefore, Paris, honed over a century, is a city of beauty and art, offering something to admire at every turn. If London, Shanghai, and New York belong to the same type of city, then Paris, Beijing, and Suzhou-Hangzhou should be considered their opposites. The former impresses with busyness, chaos, tension, and restlessness, where people strive for money, status, and fame. The latter, however, offers a sense of peace, relief, and transcendent imagination. People live in this realm, slowly savoring the pleasures of life and seeking true beauty.</p>
<h3>A Lingering Question: A French Girl Speaks of Pétain</h3>
<p>I am not exaggerating about the wonders of Paris. Two years ago, I spent some time in Paris shortly after its liberation, when everything was in disarray. The French had lost the Maginot Line in three weeks, compounded by the pain of four years of occupation. Gloom, disappointment, and discouragement filled the hearts and minds of the French people. They stood in groups in front of the National Opera House, watching young German lads leave and boisterous American kids arrive. De Gaulle had returned to Paris, Pétain was exiled, and Laval was guillotined. Most French people felt numb to the series of tragedies at that time. Until my recent visit to Paris, when a Parisian girl and I were strolling along the Seine at dusk. She said, "The French are impulsive and lack reason. The 'revolution' in the French mind is like a gust of wind, a short-lived burst of emotion. They never plan anything thoroughly." She added that "insulting old Pétain was an unconscionable act by the French people." She was in Paris at that time and knew of Pétain's dedication.</p>
<h3>Paris Has Changed: Vastly Different from Two Years Ago</h3>
<p>The right and wrong of this issue may be more complex. In any case, I feel that Paris has changed significantly compared to two years ago. First, the economic prosperity, while not perfectly ideal, is undeniable due to France's industrial base and the speed of reconstruction. Two years ago, I frequented the Champs-Élysées, the Boulevard de la Madeleine, and the Montmartre area. The shop windows were empty, the restaurants had no meat or fish, nor enough bread, the hotels lacked hot water, and there were few cars on the streets. This time, the windows are filled with wool and silk fabrics, and genuine leather shoes (note: two years ago, French people wore wooden-soled shoes). Dining in restaurants, one can find everything as long as one pays black market prices. The hotels have returned to pre-war standards. The Grand Hotel and the Paris Hotel are filled with international merchants from abroad, with room rates nearly a thousand francs a day and the "No Vacancy" sign always displayed. The George V Hotel near the Champs-Élysées, formerly requisitioned by the American command, has been returned to its original owners and is now the top hotel in Paris, mostly occupied by diplomats from various countries, with room rates exceeding a thousand francs. The Scribe Hotel, formerly requisitioned by the Allied headquarters as a base for war correspondents, now occasionally sees a few Allied officers in uniform, but most guests are merchants traveling between America and France. As long as customers are willing to spend money, the hotels can provide anything.</p>
<h3>Public Streetcars: As Many As Eight Thousand Vehicles</h3>
<p>After a separation of more than a year, Paris has indeed changed dramatically. The abundance of vehicles on the streets is something that was absolutely unimaginable two years ago. Most of the buses have been restored, and the yellow and green carriages are always packed. There are now as many as eight thousand "public streetcars," and hailing a "streetcar" in Paris seems more convenient than in London. On the fifth day of my visit to Paris, all the streetcars suddenly went on strike, reportedly because the government reduced gasoline rations and black market gasoline prices were too high. Apparently, the government later relented, so the next day, eight thousand streetcars reappeared on the streets, full of vitality.</p>
<h3>Subway Trains: Each Line is Arched</h3>
<p>The most important means of transportation in downtown Paris should be the "subway train." I have traveled to so many places, but I admire the Paris subway the most. New York's... [omitted word], seeing the subway train makes one's head swell. The carriages are dark, the seats are not comfortable at all, and the stations and tracks are covered with fruit peels, newspapers, and even gum wrappers. When I was in New York, I often thought that Americans could defeat Germany and Japan, but no one had a way to clean the New York subway. Many people praise the London Underground for being clean, orderly, and comfortable, and for being deep enough to be used as an air-raid shelter during wartime. But I still think Paris's is better. The Paris system is good, each line is arched. Stepping into the subway from any entrance, you will never get lost. Following the map, you only need to transfer once at most to reach your destination. Some people say that the Moscow subway is like an "art palace." I have not been to Moscow and dare not comment casually.</p>
<h3>Borrowed Foreign Exchange: Most of It Was Spent a Year Ago</h3>
<p>During this visit to Paris, the subway is as crowded as ever. The fare has increased from two francs to four francs per ride, and the distinction between first and second class has been eliminated. More than a dozen entrances that were closed two years ago have now been repaired and reopened. When I arrived in Paris, it was shortly after De Gaulle's speech, and the political upheaval in France was brewing intensely. I saw many political slogans posted on the walls of the subway.</p>
<p>I plan to report on the inside story of the political upheaval in France in my next dispatch. The current political and economic life in France is developing in a distorted and abnormal way. Most of the foreign exchange borrowed from the United States has been spent in a year, and the main items in customs import figures are food and cigarettes. France is still using troops in Madagascar and Vietnam, there are small-scale riots in North Africa at any time, and there are 300,000 to 400,000 overseas troops. Coupled with the military expenses of occupying Germany, the government's financial budget is still on the road to collapse.</p>
<h3>Shop Windows are Covered with 10% Discount Slogans</h3>
<p>However, in Paris, these phenomena are hidden behind the stability and prosperity. Since the Socialist Party came to power, it has loudly promoted several things: The first is that all shops, hotels, restaurants, barber shops, clothing stores, etc., strictly implement the "10% discount movement." Each shop's door is covered with a printed slogan: "10% discount." The French are smart, and the French businessmen are even smarter. On the one hand, they strictly implement the law, and on the other hand, they first raise the prices by 10% and then sell them at a 10% discount. Most of them did this. However, the clever Prime Minister Ramadier is smarter than those businessmen. Once, he said to a French reporter, "That's good. My original purpose was not to expect them to reduce prices, but to hope that they would not increase prices. Although the price reduction did not succeed, my purpose has been achieved!"</p>
<h3>The Second Masterpiece: Confiscating the Property of Merchants Who Profited from National Crisis</h3>
<p>The second masterpiece of the Socialist Party's economic measures is to confiscate the property of merchants who profited from the national crisis. Every day, the Socialist Party government's official newspaper, "Le Populaire," often discloses "for example" news: A Romanian "scavenger" youth drifted to France five or six years ago. At that time, it was when the Vichy government surrendered. This Romanian youth, because he colluded with the Germans, actually made France's "national crisis fortune" and became a multi-millionaire. After the war, he used his funds to continue to manipulate the black market in Paris. "Now, after an inspection by the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior, all property has been confiscated." For example, there are almost such legendary stories every day. In his recent speeches, Prime Minister Ramadier often compares his predecessor government with the current government. He said: The Socialist Party government has the ability to subdue France's economic crisis, and it wants the people to be calm, quiet, and work hard.</p>
<h3>The US Dollar Plummets: Foreign Tourists Suffer Great Losses</h3>
<p>However, Ramadier's masterpiece is not here. What he is most proud of is the recent plunge in the price of the US dollar, from the highest black market price of 375 francs to one to the current 190 to one. The Socialist Party government said: This indicates the stability of the French economy and the stability of the franc monetary system. However, insiders do not think so. Prices in Paris have not fallen, but foreign currencies have fallen. Therefore, the unlucky ones are foreign tourists. These days, French newspapers are studying the reasons for the drop in the price of the US dollar. It is a long story, and the reasons are very complicated. One of the immediate causes is that the French National Bank sold the gold it stored in Switzerland, absorbing a considerable amount of market hot money.</p>
<p>These deformed economic mutations are somewhat similar to China. I have been away from Shanghai for ten years. Perhaps, Shanghai's "prosperity" and extravagant paper money are comparable to Paris in the East and West. The mainland edition of London's "Daily Mail" wrote very harshly one day, saying: The British won the war, and the French did not fight. Now that the war is over, the British are bound to endure the "bitterness" rarely seen in the world, and the French are enjoying the "happiness" never seen in the world. How can this be read as fair?</p>
<p>Enjoyment is the nature of the French. Without happiness, there is no beauty in life. Without beauty, living is no different from dying. Therefore, "drink today, for tomorrow we die" has become the common life philosophy of the French people, especially the Parisians. Isn't it? The dance halls connected to the Champs-Élysées, the various nightclubs in the Pigalle area, the bare breasts of women, the naked legs of women, plus the decadent and nauseating music. The strong atmosphere of wine, powder, and perfume, plus the unnatural laughter of women, are all mixed together.</p>
<p>Winter is the season when Paris is cloudy and dormant. When spring comes, hundreds of flowers bloom on the Seine. In New York for a year, you can't hear the birds singing or smell the flowers. Once you arrive in Paris, you see green everywhere, and your tightly bound heart seems to be liberated. This morning, I hailed a streetcar and set off from the riverside in the Latin Quarter, "driving" along the banks of the Seine. The green river water reflects the green shade on the banks, shaking slightly. Dozens of granite "arch bridges" on the Seine, reflecting the warm morning sun, decorate the boundless spring scenery of this world city of flowers.</p>
<h3>A Four-Day Trip to Central and Southern Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>The restoration of Taiwan is an epoch-making event; the February 28th Incident in Taiwan can also be said to be a not-so-small major event after the restoration. Looking back now, the bloody February 28th Incident should be a terrifying day; people felt that the commotion and narrow-minded xenophobic actions of the past year and a half, in the emotional shift from eager anticipation to disappointment and resentment, might have a reaction, but what ordinary people directly felt was that the scope of the facts was not as large as that, and the bloodshed was not as much. In particular, Taichung, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung in central and southern Taiwan were the most fierce, the situation was the worst, and the time was the longest.</p>
<p>In a short time of one hundred hours, the reporter made the first post-unrest pilgrimage to the hinterland of these three bleeding points of the February 28th Incident.</p>
<h3>Survivors: Full of Thrilling Stories</h3>
<p>The reporters left Taipei on an early express train on the 29th of last month. In the past, it was possible to buy second-class tickets and sit in comfortable seats, but now it is impossible. Even if you buy first-class tickets, you still cannot find a seat. The number of trains during the day has been reduced, and military control is in place in the evening, so it is not possible to pass through. As a result, all the passengers are squeezed into the few trains during the day.</p>
<p>When the reporters visited local leaders, everyone congratulated each other on surviving the catastrophe. And when each person recounted his experience during the incident, it was like listening to different thrilling stories. The stories are full of blood and tears. Obviously, the local leaders who were able to avoid accidents relied on their usual behavior, and more importantly, they were able to adhere to their positions and endure the suffering to display the sense of justice of loving the nation and the country.</p>
<p>Kaohsiung Mayor Huang Zhongge is a "half-mountain" (Taiwanese people satirize mainlanders as "Ah Shan," call mainlanders who come from the mainland provinces "half-mountain," and call Taiwanese women who marry mainlanders "leaning against the mountain," calling it "three mountains"), and still cannot avoid receiving threatening and intimidating gifts from thugs. When he led seven senators to visit Commander Peng Mengji at the fortress headquarters, one of the thugs was carrying a short gun and attempted to assassinate him. This scene was terrifying. Chiayi Mayor Sun Zhijun retreated to the airport during the unrest, but still risked his life to negotiate with the thugs. His wit helped him escape from the tiger's mouth. Taichung Mayor Huang Keli from Quanzhou speaks Hokkien, but in such unrest, the Hokkien language of "Ah Shan" lost its effect. He also needed to be able to speak Japanese. The thugs could not forget Japan. He escaped from Wufeng back to the city and was "concentrated" again, suffering great danger and coercion. The Taiwanese communists wanted his magic weapon: the official secret code.</p>
<h3>A Kind of Trial: Great Lessons in Suffering</h3>
<p>This time, it was a lesson for both officials and civilians, and even more so a trial for the military police and constitution.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Wang Jie of the Kaohsiung Fortress Headquarters recalled that it was painstaking to deal with the situation at that time. For the safety of the people, the maintenance of public security, and the protection of life and the harbor, he had to fight, but in order to obey the orders from above not to act rashly, he could not fight. He could not fight the people. To fight or not to fight, this was the most hesitant problem.</p>
<p>Li Shirong, the squadron leader of the Chiayi Gendarmerie District, led all eighteen comrades to escort public servants to retreat in the midst of urgent gunfire, and then re-entered the city. In the end, there was a fierce battle at the airport. The thugs threatened him in writing and by phone to surrender his weapons, otherwise "120,000 citizens can use a bamboo pole" to kill all mainlanders. Due to the weakness of the strength, weapons could be surrendered, but in order to maintain the integrity of the soldiers, they must not surrender rashly. Therefore, to surrender or not to surrender made him painstakingly consider.</p>
<p>The local authorities carefully adhered to and properly handled the emergency situation under the circumstances of "expedient handling," which was indeed a kind of trial. The arrival of the thugs was like a rainstorm, and both the official and civilian sides lost control. 80% of the police officers that administrative officials could command were Taiwanese, and they all abandoned their posts in the face of the enemy. A military stimulus without strength only increased the arrogance of the thugs. In the midst of suffering, we saw the division between good and bad people, and we also saw the indomitable and awe-inspiring spirit of resistance of the soldiers, and the situation of the unarmed public servants was even more pitiful.</p>
<p>Of these three major cities in central and southern Taiwan, the one that lasted the longest was Chiayi, and the situation was also the most tragic. 20,000 people participated. When the reporters surveyed the "battlefield" in the city, they could still see trenches and bullet marks.</p>
<p>What we are most concerned about are the death and injury figures. The statistics provided by the local governments are:</p>
<p>Chiayi: Mainlanders (Public Servants)</p>
<p>Dead: 11 people</p>
<p>Injured: 51 people</p>
<p>Minor injuries not included</p>
<p>Taiwanese:</p>
<p>Dead: 406 people</p>
<p>Injured: 131 people</p>
<p>Missing: 9 people</p>
<p>Kaohsiung: Dead and injured officers and soldiers (guarding warehouses): 31 people</p>
<p>Executed according to law: 14 people</p>
<p>Soldiers who violated military discipline: 2 people</p>
<p>Taichung: Mainlanders:</p>
<p>Injured: 50 people</p>
<p>Dead: 5 people</p>
<p>Taiwanese:</p>
<p>Dead: 2 people</p>
<p>The above is just a preliminary investigation figure. In the case of Chiayi, as far as the reporter knows, the actual number is more than this.</p>
<h3>Good Taiwanese Compatriots Are Still Respectable and Loveable</h3>
<p>This incident has a common point, that is, the thugs all came from Taipei. They took trucks to various places to incite, collude with local thugs and hooligans, and political careerists took the opportunity to move around, and in the final stage, a small number of communists joined in. In various places, "General Staff Headquarters" or "Operations Headquarters" were established, and below them were several teams and several groups. And they all put forward "conditions," distributed Japanese leaflets, and Japanese-style military equipment. In addition to knives and sticks, there were also light and heavy machine guns, and even small steel cannons. They had different goals. The hooligans tried to surrender their weapons to make capital, the careerists wanted to take the opportunity to become officials, and the communists participated in discord and sabotage. Under different goals, they showed a complex, naive, and pathetic struggle and xenophobic action.</p>
<p>Most of the hooligans retreated from the mainland and overseas, and some were released from Fire Island. Among them, there are hundreds of thousands of people in total, and most of them are soldiers. The political careerists are all "Star People's Association" figures. Because the government was lenient, they became the "red people" of the people after the restoration. The communists were probably not members of the CCP or the Japanese Communist Party, that is, these people called "Taiwanese communists," in the midst of most of the good people, directed an unprecedented bloody tragedy under the pretext of "suppressing smuggling."</p>
<p>From another perspective, the good Taiwanese compatriots are still a lovely and respectable nation.</p>
<p>During this incident, witnessed and touched, many well-behaved Taiwanese compatriots, farmers, and workers never participated, and they also protected the place where they worked as their own business, and some even rescued mainlanders regardless of their own safety. An old man in Huwei, Taichung, hid a mainlander platoon leader and had his ears cut off. He is still in the hospital now.</p>
<h3>The Blood Crack Needs to Be Quickly Repaired</h3>
<p>The February 28th Incident wrote down the record of the bloody crack between mainlanders and Taiwanese. Currently, it is the period of appeasement and village cleansing. The party, government, and military cooperate to investigate the population and collect weapons. This will be the end of the incident. During this period, the people unanimously hope that the government will be lenient and not investigate the accomplices except for the main culprits, and they also hope that there will be a public trial and a clear execution according to law. This has already been promised by Minister Bai. It is worth noting that the voice of protection for public servants is rising everywhere. They embrace a passion and cross the ocean to work for this newly born island province. As a result, their treatment is lower than that in the country and they cannot make ends meet, and they have also obtained unexpected "retribution." This complaint is waiting for the compensation of the feelings of mainlanders and Taiwanese.</p>
<p>We must not ignore the most important factor that contributed to the bloody incident: the reflection of Japanese thought and culture. And the people's lives are unstable due to high prices, which directly touches everyone's heart. Naturally, the re-transmission and re-education of thoughts and culture must enable the Taiwanese compatriots to imperceptibly expand their horizons and minds, and develop their love for the motherland!</p>
<p>The blood crack needs to be repaired quickly and properly. The new strength will be more solid than before. I hope that the February 28th Incident will be a new turning point in Taiwan.</p>

<h3>Tentative Suggestions for Road Construction in This City</h3>
<p>Recently, roads in various parts of the city have been gradually repaired, and Tianmu Road is undergoing major reconstruction. I am optimistic about the city's construction and very excited. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I respectfully offer several suggestions for our municipal authorities to consider, which I disclose in this column: (1) It is necessary to open up a road through the racecourse, connecting east, west, north, and south, to alleviate traffic congestion in the central area. (2) Connect roads in the eastern district directly to the Xinza District and the West Shanghai District, so as to avoid passing through the central district roads south of the Suzhou River. (A) Connect Tiantong Road on North Zhejiang Road to Alabaster Road (separated only by a cemetery), and then connect it to Kulun Road, which will lead to the Xinza Bridge. The Xinza Bridge must be rebuilt to allow vehicles to pass, so that vehicles in the eastern district can directly reach the Xinza District via this road. (B) Widen and straighten Xinmin Road to Hengfeng Road Bridge, so that vehicles in the eastern and northern districts can directly reach West Shanghai via this road. (3) According to the current traffic situation, the roads in Shanghai must maintain a width that can simultaneously accommodate trams, cars, and various slower vehicles, so as to avoid congestion and collisions. Therefore, the main traffic lines in Shanghai should be gradually widened, and the planned new roads, as well as the central urban area, Zhabei District, West Shanghai District, and South Shanghai District, should especially have their width enlarged in advance to meet the future development needs of Shanghai. It seems that fast lanes and slow lanes should not be separated, because separation seems inconvenient and uneconomical, as can be seen on Zhongzheng Road. (4) The existing houses along the roads that have been moved back or destroyed in the war should be widened immediately, and shantytowns or wooden fences should not be allowed to encroach on the road surface again, or to build reed fences and pile up debris on the sidewalks, hindering traffic. (5) It is common to see many large and small stones, gravel, cement blocks, asphalt blocks, or mud and dirt accumulated on the sidewalks of the city's roads. It seems that the public works authorities should collect and pile them up in open spaces, storing them for other uses, because old materials are not without their uses, and it is also a way to save materials to supplement the insufficient construction funds, as well as to make the roads clean, to facilitate traffic, and to improve the appearance. (6) After the roads in the city are repaired, it is common to see stones, gravel, and stone chips left on the roadside, which often mix with garbage over time. The repaired gravel roads are often not firm and solid, and become loose, uneven, and bumpy in a few days. This is not because of reducing materials and cheating on labor, because there are surplus materials that are discarded on the roadside. This inevitably wastes labor and materials, and makes citizens feel that the municipal administration is poor. Our public works authorities should strictly supervise to avoid wasting manpower and resources. (7) There are often many garbage or dirt piles along the roads in the city, or the ditches are blocked and the water does not recede. In the morning, there are also dung carts leaking dung juice on the road, which is truly a feeling of dung and dirt. I think that Shanghai, one of the world's major cities, is truly ashamed of even a cleaner small city. Moreover, the summer season is approaching, and isn't this city promoting epidemic prevention? I think that giving vaccinations in garbage piles is not as good as clearing garbage and dirt first. I hope that our health authorities will not just promote it, but should also work hard in practice, because to talk about hygiene, environmental cleanliness is the most basic condition. (8) In order to remove garbage and excess gravel and mud bricks in this city, it is best for the Public Works Bureau to build a temporary road from Pudong along the highway to Chuansha East Coast, where a beach slopes out into the sea, roughly parallel to the coast. On the one hand, two car ferries should be built in the Huangpu River to transport cars across the river. The Health Bureau can then use this construction to transport garbage and sand, soil, bricks, and stones to the seaside, gradually accumulating them on the beach. Over time, it may form a long and narrow breakwater, and the inside of the breakwater may form a small harbor for sailboats or fishing boats to dock. Given the large amount of garbage in this city, and the fact that it has always been a difficult problem for the municipal authorities to deal with, my suggestion may be helpful in solving this problem.</p>
<h3>Two Army Commanders of the Divine Eagle Unit: Cultured General Sun Liren and Tough General Pan Yukun</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>Aviation News from Changchun, One Day</p>
<p>In the eventful Northeast, the Divine Eagle Unit, the New First Army, which defends the borders of the motherland, has glorious battle achievements in protecting southern Songjiang. Their blood and sweat flow on the thorns on the road to the great unity of the motherland.</p>
<p>This is a glorious army. The fame of the former army commander, General Sun Liren, has spread far and wide overseas. He is a cultured general, and caring for the people is the fine tradition of this army. He is warmly loved by the people everywhere. It is no accident that the Divine Eagle Unit has achieved outstanding battle results. General Sun has been promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command. He told reporters about his feelings about the promotion: I feel that the burden on my shoulders has been lightened a lot. However, his enthusiasm for serving the country and the nation is overflowing and remains firm for a long time. He said: A female reporter called him an old general, which is really regrettable, and then he laughed heartily.</p>
<p>The new army commander, General Pan Yumin, was originally the commander of the 50th Division of this army. He is a resolute and decisive model soldier, and also a tough general with a loyal heart and iron bones. On the front line of the Songhua River, in the Communist army's New Year offensive, Lin Biao fought him head-on several times. The defense of Dehui was the most disheartening for Lin Biao. Lin Biao besieged Dehui with tens of thousands of troops, attacking fiercely for a week without being able to take it, suffering great sacrifices and having to retreat in the face of difficulty. The reporter met General Pan in the war zone at that time. After many sleepless nights, he told the reporter with red eyes: "The Communist bandits are going against me and are deliberately looking for trouble for me." The isolated and arduous struggles of the bridgehead on the north bank of the Songhua River in the previous battles best represent the tough bones of General Pan's subordinates. Even if the Communist army pulled out their teeth, they could not pull out this iron nail. Their brilliant battle results have earned their troops the glory of being named the Zhongzheng Division, and the company that stubbornly defended the bridgehead was named the Zhongzheng Company.</p>
<p>At his first press conference after being appointed army commander, General Pan said: If I receive the order to take over Harbin, I will announce this good news first. It can be seen how deeply he cherishes the motherland and the nation with a loyal and passionate soul. The following is a brief introduction to General Pan's resume: Pan Yukun, courtesy name Kongxi, is from Liuyang, Hunan. He graduated from the fourth class of infantry and the fourth class of the senior class of the Huangpu Military Academy. He received training in the Lushan and Luojia Mountain Training Groups and Lamgarh in India. In 1925, he served as a probationary officer, platoon leader, company commander, and battalion commander in the newly編2nd Division. Later, he participated in the Northern Expedition and was wounded. In 1937, he was promoted to Colonel and Commander of the 83rd Regiment of the 14th Division. He participated in the Battle of Shanghai and was wounded. He was transferred to the commander of the honor regiment of the division. Then he was transferred to the commander of the 80th Regiment of the 14th Division, Brigadier General Infantry Commander, Brigadier General Deputy Commander and Director of the Political Department of the 50th Division of the Army. In February 1944, he was promoted to Commander of the 50th Division. On April 5 of this year, he was promoted to Commander of the New First Army and Commander of the Changchun Garrison.</p>

<h3>Maugham Promotes Emerging Writers</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The British playwright Maugham (Somerset Maugham; the "gha" in this name is silent, pronounced "Mawm," and should not be translated as "Maoganmu") gave 15,000 pounds to the British Writers' Association as a fund to be awarded annually to promising writers under the age of thirty. The prize is selected by three judges from the Writers' Association. The only condition of the prize is that the writer must spend the money abroad.</p>
<p>Maugham said: "He can go wherever he wants. If he likes, he can go to Monte Carlo and gamble it all away within a week; or, if he is more economical, he can use the money to travel around the world for a week. This reward is for someone who has published a book, whether it be poetry, novels, biographies, or philosophy, as long as the judges think he will achieve something in the future.</p>
<p>"I ask the judges not to hesitate and not to be afraid of taking risks. I said that it doesn't matter if they choose the wrong nine out of ten. I think it would be very worthwhile if only one writer could really produce something every ten years that would enrich English literature.</p>
<p>"In short, it would be a very good average if ten writers could be produced every century."</p>
<p>Maugham had this idea forty years ago, when he was just starting out as a playwright. He told Shaw that the judges should not be too old, preferably not over forty. People over forty may not understand new ideas. The combined age of the three judges will probably not exceed one hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>Maugham said, "I originally wanted to put this in my will. But I'm afraid I won't live that long. I can't wait, I think it's best to give the money away while I'm still alive."</p>
<p>Two Chinese literary magazines, "Literary Renaissance," often publish the works of emerging writers, and "Literary Spring and Autumn" recently published a special issue on emerging writers. This intention can be said to be the same as Maugham's.</p>
<h3>Passing Through Xinning Again (Sketch)</h3>
<p>— KM</p>
<p>How serene is this small mountain town!</p>
<p>A masterpiece forgotten by Lope de Vega and Shakespeare,</p>
<p>Thrown alive into this stone urn.</p>
<p>It is Kathmandu under the Wuling Mountains;</p>
<p>It is a pictograph of Graz in a small country.</p>
<p>At noon, the sun rises from the peaks hanging with green vines,</p>
<p>Soaring straight up to the sky, to look down on people's lunch;</p>
<p>The fortress leaning westward falls,</p>
<p>How short it is, a dream!</p>
<p>Pomelo candy is still on the market,</p>
<p>The pear-shaped small berries in autumn, fragrant, sweet, and refreshing!</p>
<p>Now hire a boat to the Fuyi River! Across the river, in Longjian,</p>
<p>See the Cinnamomum camphora and nanmu trees, forming a forest of maple and nanmu,</p>
<p>Bananas that do not bear meat, transplanted to Lingnan,</p>
<p>Become fresh and tender food.</p>
<p>These are just the landscapes under the brush of ink painters!</p>
<p>Traveling east from Wugang by sedan chair, after four days of dangerous mountain roads, we arrived at a small stone rest pavilion east of the city street. As usual, there were some disabled people in the pavilion, either huddled in the corner of the pavilion or selling rice noodles and fried glutinous rice cakes. Jiao Tang got out of the sedan chair and said that the first thing to visit was the Liu family, a prominent family in Xinning (the elderly Liu Hongdu, the newly appointed member of the Legislative Yuan's Audit Committee, grew up in this ancient mansion).</p>
<p>Jiao Tang still remembered that during the first Battle of Northern Hunan six years ago, he had visited the Liu residence when he came here for reasons related to the front line. The buildings, pavilions, and terraces in the residence, and the pavilions and kiosks facing the ancient pond, had a bit of the flavor of the Ten Temples of Shichahai in Beijing. The towering camphor and nanmu trees and arhat pines grew around the high walls, and the painted corridors and carved beams and the elegance of the doors and walls were like viewing ancient paintings.</p>
<p>The Liu residence has such a ancestral elegant and leisurely environment!... It is said that their ancestors were meritorious personnel under Zeng Guofan and Zuo Zongtang, and the blessings of that time are still shining brightly today. Jiao Tang walked past the gate of the Liu residence and hesitated for a long time. It was not until the gatekeeper said, "Principal Liu! (Mr. Hongdu's younger brother) is not home yet," that he stepped straight in.</p>
<p>Turning from the back street to the riverside, we saw Xinning's only middle school standing in the blowing mountain wind, with willow catkins all over the walls, just shaking outward non-stop. Before long, we suddenly met Mr. Lin, whom we had known six years ago. When asked about Xinning in the five years since we last met, he said;</p>
<p>"What else is there to say! No one expected that the saying 'Peach Blossom Spring can avoid Qin' would not be fulfilled at all. The burning, looting, and robbery in the past six months were unavoidable every day. Most of the utensils in our house were transported from remote rural areas."</p>
<h3>The Uniqueness of Poets</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>In Tsurumi's "Biography of Byron" in Japan, there is such a passage:</p>
<p>In 1811, when Byron had just returned to London from traveling, he received the bad news of his mother's death. It turned out that she died because she was angry about the furniture merchant's increased price bill. Byron painfully rushed back to his castle to bury his mother. Strangely, he did not continue the funeral to the cemetery, but stood at the door and stared blankly. Finally, he called the servant Boyford to bring boxing gloves, and they fiercely wrestled with each other at home. It is said that he used this fierce fight to relieve the grief in his heart.</p>
<p>After passing through a narrow river street, Jiao Tang suddenly thought of Qi Pin, who used to eat dog meat early in the morning, an expert on Ibsen who lived in Shaoyang, Xinning. He also recalled the painter Yang Taiyang from Guilin, the poet Wu Benxing from Anhua, the high-pitched singer Qian Weizhen from Hangzhou, and the educator Zhou Zhenbang from Beiping, who often visited each other... They all moved to the interior from various transportation hubs, and then were introduced and came to this mountain country.</p>
<p>Not long after this group of people started winter, Qi Pin suddenly suffered a family tragedy of "shooting his wife with an air gun," and then they all went to various places to serve their new masters. Jiao Tang still vaguely remembered that on the day before he left Xinning, he went to the prison in the county office to visit Qi Pin. Qi Pin said with a smile, very naturally:</p>
<p>"Who knows what the reason is! Killing his wife, huh, I don't even understand it myself... I'm still confused now... However, when my father and brothers were alive, because their power was great, they had many enemies. I can't help but feel a little implicated..."</p>
<p>Recalling the past, Jiao Tang couldn't help but mention this plot to Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin said that Qi Pin had been extradited to the Shaoyang prison long ago. His case seems to be never asked about in Xinning. It will always become a confusing trap... Could someone be teasing him?</p>
<p>Is Xinning such a place? Are people so treacherous and wolfish in their hearts? It doesn't seem like it... They are so gentle and don't show their emotions on their faces!</p>
<p>Mr. Lin told Jiao Tang that the German missionary who lived in a fortress below had returned, and many parts of his house had been destroyed by the Japanese. He returned to this empty temple, and like us, he felt lonely every day!... Let's go across the Fuyi River to take a look while it's still early."</p>
<h3>Three Records of Cherishing the Remaining Spring - Sequel to a Dream in Yangzhou, Sixteen</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>In addition to what was mentioned in the previous record, there were also many particularly interesting people among the guests at Xiyuchun at that time, which must also be recorded:</p>
<p>(1) Xue Wansui was an old scholar. Every evening, he would drink four taels of liquor and get very drunk. After getting drunk, he would hum the lines from Peking Opera, "Long live the emperor, the little one gets drunk every day." People therefore called him Wansui (Long Live).</p>
<p>(2) Liu Daling This person used to be a magistrate. But he had a violent temper. After expelling his concubine, he lived alone. He ate almost all three meals at Xiyuchun. And he ate and drank arbitrarily, spending about one yuan per meal, but he paid in cash and never kept an account. And because there was no one at home, all the deposits and rent collection records were rolled up in his horse-hoof sleeves.</p>
<p>(3) Jin Sanhuazi His family was very well-off, but the clothes he wore were extremely tattered. If someone in his family occasionally made him new clothes, he would immediately take them away and sell them, claiming to be a beggar. Because he was the third child, he was called Sanhuazi (Third Beggar).</p>
<p>(4) Wang Huotou was good at singing opera. If his peers offered him a cigarette, he could sing a long song. He claimed to be from the Wang Guifen school, so people called him Huotou (Fire Head). He was also good at poetry, but he was addicted to opium and was so poor that he often went hungry. He just draped his long gown over his left arm and refused to put it on. When asked why, he said, "My long gown is crisp, and it will fall apart if you touch it!" (</p>
<p>(5) Jiang Menshen was a doctor. He was not good at chess at all, but when others were playing chess, he would always interrupt. If the chess players tried to stop him, he would become even more energetic, gesticulating and pointing randomly on the board. People would respond with angry voices, but he would not get angry and would still interrupt. Because he was very tall, people called him Menshen (Door God).</p>
<p>(6) Wang Laoben was over seventy years old, but his face was extremely rosy. Some said that his face resembled a peach blossom. He said, "These four characters are not like a near-body poem." People therefore added "Wang Laotai" to make it a seven-character sentence. He liked to play and make trouble with people, and often used his dry tobacco pouch to hit people. Because he was old, people did not fight back, and just laughed, like children.</p>
<p>(7) Guo Daizi practiced medicine and also taught at a private school. He lived in Niansi Bridge and called himself the Guest of Niansi Bridge. He entered the city at three o'clock every afternoon and left the city at ten o'clock. If the city gate was closed, he would sit in Xiyuchun all night. Because he liked to drool, people called him Daizi (Fool). Or someone would give him a couplet: "At the head of Niansi Bridge, composing poems and writing antithetical couplets; in the nineteenth hell, teaching at a private school and practicing medicine."</p>
<p>(8) Duan Zhang This person was a scholar. Because he was short, people called him Ai Zhang (Short Zhang). He especially liked to use false allusions to deceive people. If people asked him where they came from, he would laugh and say, "Why be serious!"</p>
<p>(9) Nandou and Beidou Wang and Qu, both over sixty years old, often sat facing each other at a table outside the counter, but they never said a word to each other. Qu was humorous, and people called him Nandou (Southern Dipper), while Wang was dull, and people called him Beidou (Northern Dipper).</p>
<p>In addition, it should be mentioned that the guests at Xiyuchun also organized a music association. Participants had to come up with a pseudonym, and the pseudonym had to be related to their name. For example, Mr. Zang Yisun, my late great-grandfather, changed his name to Zanghuo (Zang's slave), Mr. Ji Lianggong changed his name to Jili (Lucky), Mr. Xuan Guyu changed his name to Xuanbu (Announce), Mr. Kong Xiaoshan changed his name to Kongfang (Square Hole), Mr. Tan Yiwei changed his name to Tanxian (Talk Leisurely), and Mr. Ji Jinping changed his name to Jinqian (Money). Even the owner, Tuo Weng, changed his name to Gaoxing (Happy).</p>
<h3>The Tombstone of a Maiden</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>A Papillose-style statue of a pitiful Greek maiden, standing there sadly, her left hand holding a small box, her right hand seeming to be taking out some ornaments from the box, but no ornaments were carved out. Observing its traces, it can be known that it was originally painted with extremely gorgeous colors.</p>
<p>There were many such works in early Greece. In prehistoric times, there was originally painting first, and then relief evolved from painting. This tombstone should be a hybrid product in this process.</p>
<p>The layout of this work, the technique of clothing, and the expression of the body are truly remarkable. It can be said to be representative of the upright style of the first half of the fifth century BC. It was originally collected by a noble family of Venus and later acquired by a German and entered the Berlin National Gallery. Made of marble, it is 1.428 meters high.</p>
<h3>Night Rain - A Small Record in Sickness</h3>
<p>— Xuan Jianren</p>
<p>It is late at night, and the rain is playing metallic music on the roof. Outside the window, darkness stretches in all directions. The dim light of an oil lamp in the sickroom cannot sweep away the darkness in the room. I can't sleep, but I can't control the wild horse of my thoughts. When I was sick as a child, my mother's care was so kind. As long as I turned over or coughed, she would gently walk to the bedside; even late at night, my mother would watch over me without closing her eyes; now, she is far away in ancient Chang'an. Listening to the sound of the rain outside the window, I have endless thoughts...</p>
<p>Groans came from the next sickroom again.</p>
<p>Sickness, this demon, when can it be eliminated? My young life has not yet bloomed into a brilliant flower, so let it wither silently like this, I am not reconciled, I want to complain to heaven!</p>
<p>Many past dreams, one by one, prompt me to revisit them: Xin, far away in the Northeast, Ruo, still remaining in the mountain city, Zhu, who has lost contact, Ying, who is already the mother of children... Each dream is a poem written with my heart's blood, let me recite it in the quiet night, recite it to the end of my life. I want to write my name on people's hearts.</p>
<p>The rain is falling, falling.</p>
<h3>The Poet's Last Words of Heroism</h3>
<p>— Meng Long</p>
<p>The death of a great writer is often the end of a tragic drama. The poet Goethe, on his deathbed, probably feeling the gloom of the world, shouted out a final heroic saying: "More light!" The poet Heine, who was contemporary with Goethe, did not forget to propose his will before his death: "Please insert a sword and a pen on my tombstone!"</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood 503</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Is that Mr. Gu Chengzhi? This is Shouyi on the phone." Because Tsurumi used his original name on the hotel registration and had told Shouyi the brief history of this original name, Shouyi greeted Tsurumi using this name: "I'm telling you two things; first, that letter..." (referring to the mysterious letter paper with a black circle drawn by Elder Aoki). "Although it is written strangely, I have already consulted Elder Juechang of my village. The old man said that this letter must be seen by the original recipient before it can take effect..." This explains that this mysterious letter must be seen by Pingzi herself before it can take effect. Shouyi vaguely told Tsurumi that Elder Juechang was not unable to use this effect; however, Pingzi was Elder Aoki's medium for spiritual communication, so of course it was most in line with the principles of spiritual science to communicate through Pingzi herself...</p>
<p>"In case the recipient herself cannot come out, the old man has promised to do it himself by midnight." Shouyi explained this point to reduce Tsurumi's anxiety. Even if Pingzi has not come out of the bandit's den after midnight, Elder Zechang can also try it out.</p>
<p>"The second thing that needs to be explained, according to the old man's analysis, the one in the Hongzhen area is the most suitable of the three 'nests'. Although it is said that the two people being escorted there are both men, perhaps this is a smokescreen by the bandits to make it difficult for people to guess. In addition, the old man has realized that the bandits' method probably has other purposes. As for what purpose, because the old man is not very clear about the inside story of Japanese spies, he cannot explain it for the time being... Our village people intend to have other methods for these three nests, but the steps have not yet been determined, so we will talk about it when we meet again..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi received this phone call from Shouyi, and a big stone fell from his heart. Originally, his greatest goal in coming south with Pingzi this time was of course to eliminate the "Secret Operation of the Eighth" planned by the Japanese military. Of course, he himself was not considered proactive in this move, and Pingzi, the proactive executor, was indeed mysterious in her actions, but in reality, she was probably just a tool, receiving instructions from Elder Aoki behind the scenes; even she herself was mechanical, receiving one instruction and implementing one step.</p>
<p>However, when it came to this final and important step, she unexpectedly encountered this kind of accident, and the time was so tight; the last trick in the bag was just a black ink circle. Except for Pingzi herself, this order was simply a dumb riddle, and it could even be said to be a bit of an excessive game, even childish. Just imagine, if there were no revolutionary people like Han Wan to participate in the action at this time, no top counterintelligence executives to send Li Ming to cooperate, and no patriotic elements of Bai Ren Village to support them, would it be possible for Tsurumi alone, with only Zheng Yan added, to solve this thorny problem if they encountered it?</p>
<p>Furthermore, although Tsurumi had made various conjectures about this "Secret of the Eighth" in Beiping and W, etc., and later Pingzi had explained the nature and method of this secret, how could the Japanese military, after racking their brains and arranging such a huge secret operation, be child's play, and how could it be so simple? What is the key? What are the steps to launch this huge secret? Even if the key can be grasped and the steps of the launch are clear, how can it be destroyed? Even if there is now a definite and complete method to destroy it, is it possible to fully accomplish it with such limited time?</p>
<h3>Poems from Mengwai Building</h3>
<p>— Xu Chengyu</p>
<p>Inscription on Jiang Yonghong's posthumous manuscripts</p>
<p>The deceased has posthumous manuscripts, the paper and ink are scattered; flipping through the volumes, I recall his life, his spirit still in sight; the clear words chase the white snow, the autumn wind echoes the green bamboo; facing each other in silence, I brush away the dust and feel the flowing waterfall.</p>
<p>Thanking Lu Yanshao for the painting he gave</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's brushstrokes are unmatched in the world, the lofty scholar in the forest seems about to come out; the wind and smoke are vast and come between the pines, the secluded art of the steep stream returns to the clouds and sun; he gave it to me from afar to hang in a corner of my seat, looking at it, I feel clear and unrestrained and transcendent.</p>
<h3>Bi Xiang Pavilion Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiaqing</p>
<p>To the Tune of Qi Tian Le: Summer Night, Harmonizing with Qingzhen</p>
<p>Water and clouds sever the north and south of the flowers, as the woods gradually darken with the approaching evening. Floating duckweed carries fragrance, gulls dream serenely on the waves, one would do well to lightly tailor a lotus leaf robe. The silver screen hides the moon; the oil lamp exudes a cool smoke; a light breeze stirs the Xiang River bank. I idly murmur, incorporating the clear lament of Chu poetry into my verse.</p>
<p>It is difficult to ask about past events; the passage of time startles the years, and sorrows know no bounds. Beyond the bamboo, flutes play; beside the wine, swords are discussed, all to no avail, leaving the autumn heart to twist and turn; the fine evening stretches far. I await the ice-cooled pistils of the flowers, freshly presented on a jade platter, stirring up idle feelings; my dark eyebrows knit with worry.</p>
<p>Sweeping Flowers, Strolling Through Pines, Evening Sitting with Elder Sister Yu</p>
<p>A light chill resembles wine, just past the drunken Double Ninth Festival, countless chaotic sorrows. Walking along silently, facing the delicate beauty of autumn, I idly chant beautiful verses. The phoenix leaves rustle; how much wind and rain can they endure? Quietly looking back, beside the pond under the willows, I still seek a pleasant spot.</p>
<p>How much beauty remains? This time, we renew our clear wandering; gathering joy beside the verses. The fleeting years fly by, afraid that an inch of autumn light will quickly fade away. With a short flute and the west wind, I want to entrust my idle feelings. Silently I gaze, watching the setting sun gradually lower into the trees.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk While Anchored</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Greek mythology recounts—</p>
<p>Prometheus was humanity's benefactor because he stole fire from the heavens for humans, and was thus imprisoned by the fire god Zeus. Later, Zeus realized he was a prophet and intended to restore his freedom, but the self-possessed Prometheus believed that suffering for humanity was his duty, and ultimately refused the fire god's pardon.</p>
<p>Suffering and tribulation are the inevitable fate of all prophets.</p>
<p>Expressed in philosophers and religious figures, it is calm endurance, without complaint. Socrates drinking hemlock and Christ being nailed to the cross have both forged immortal sacred events in history—this is the ultimate good in humanity's ideal.</p>
<p>And expressed in poets and artists, it is passionate shouting; a deep and unwavering affection. Like Qu Yuan and Dante's exile and Sima Qian's acceptance of the terrible punishment of castration, they did not yield, and continued to dedicate themselves to others until death—this is the ultimate truth in humanity's ideal.</p>
<p>Therefore—truth, this—good; to seek harmony and balance with the beauty of the universe is the glorious purpose of life.</p>
<p>A friend asked me about my view on life, and I answered with the above words.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Ideal Couple</h3>
<p>— Ge Yi</p>
<p>Mrs. Yang Siqi, a French woman, embraces her pure love to travel around the world, searching for her ideal couple. This kind and great lady hopes to explore the secrets of love in the love between husband and wife, so that there are no abandoned husbands and resentful wives in the world, and further, that human love is immersed in harmonious happiness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yang recently arrived in Shanghai. On the 30th, she gave a public lecture at the Lyceum Theatre, titled "Traveling Around the World in Search of the Ideal Couple." She said that she had been to Italy, Palestine, Spain, and Paris, but in the places she had passed through, some couples were filled with love murders or hostility, some exchanged sweet kisses but held sharp knives in their hands, some lived licentious lives, some endured monotony, and some, because they had no children, inevitably made the lives of the couples lose warmth. Finally, she arrived in Shanghai and finally encountered a happy couple. The secret of the love of this most ideal Chinese couple is that they have a week of silence every three months, during which they refuse all external affairs, so that the whole family is in a state of rest. After this, they return to their original state.</p>
<p>I really don't know if Mrs. Yang's announcement is true or just a joke? If the happiness of love lies in this separation and reunion, then the ideal couple does not seem to be so difficult to achieve. If this is not a conclusion, then what is the ideal couple? Does an ideal couple exist in the world?</p>
<p>I once had a vague idea: all "ideals" are eternal, but to seek the "reality" of this ideal is a bit like trying to catch the moon in the water. The love between husband and wife is also the same. We can have an "ideal couple," but we will never find a "perfect couple." This is because the ideal is the most forward-looking, and when the ideal becomes reality, another new ideal is beckoning us. Many couples often feel that their family lacks something and is not ideal enough, but when they make up for that defect, they cannot be satisfied. Some feel that their family is quiet and gloomy because they have no children, but when they have children, they hate the hustle and bustle of the family! Humans can never be satisfied in reality, so humans always generate their ideals; pursuing ideals and promoting reality may be the driving force of social evolution.</p>
<p>Is the happiness between husband and wife mysterious? What is the secret to harmonious love? These are all determined by subjective temperament, knowledge, and health. And both sides are relative, not absolute.</p>
<p>Tolstoy once had a famous saying: "Men and women must return to their respective jobs." Perhaps the ideal couple is produced under such conditions.</p>
<h3>Money Can't Buy</h3>
<p>— Yan Anfu</p>
<p>On my first night back from overseas, I went to visit my sweetheart. Her father and mother, being discreet, left us alone in the parlor to talk. As we were embracing and kissing, I suddenly noticed her young sister standing at the doorway, staring at us with wide eyes. "If you're willing to be a good girl, go back to your room and go to sleep," I said to the little girl, "then I'll give you twenty-five cents."</p>
<p>The child did not accept my bribe, nor did she speak, and ran away. But she came back in a little while. "Here's fifty cents," she said, "let me watch you."</p>
<h3>About Six Records of a Floating Life</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Six Records of a Floating Life is a widely read book because of its special style, with an autobiographical story, combining life art, leisurely feelings, landscape scenery, literary criticism and art criticism, and so on. Therefore, Chinese authors mostly love this book. Lin Yutang is the best example. He once translated it into English, and it was published in sections in the English T'ien Hsia Monthly and The China Critic. Later, it was published as a separate book by The China Critic, translated as Six Chapters of a Floating Life, which made foreign readers linger and unable to put it down.</p>
<p>The author was Shen Fu (Sanbai) from Suzhou during the Qianlong period. Although it is not known when he died, according to the self-description in the book, the writing of the fourth record must have been after 1808. The existing four records were discovered by Yang Yinchuan at a cold stall in Suzhou and were first published in 1877. The titles of the four records are: "Joys of the Bedchamber," "Leisurely Interests," "Adversities and Sorrows," and "Joys of Wandering." As for the missing two records, they are "Records of Zhongshan Travels" and "Records of the Way to Nourish Life." From Guan Yiwei's "Preface" and the surviving table of contents, we know that the fifth chapter records his experiences in Taiwan, and the sixth chapter records his insights and feelings about the way to nurture life.</p>
<p>However, the Six Records of a Floating Life (published by the World Book Company) currently printed on the market has actually found the missing two records. It is said that this was also discovered by a famous writer in a certain place in Suzhou, and the chapter "Records of the Way to Nourish Life" has been corrected to "Records of Nourishing Leisure." Of course, the discoverer has his own basis. Whether it is reliable as Shen's handwriting, we don't need to discuss it; however, the author occasionally talked about this matter with my teacher Zheng Yimei, but knew another fact about Six Records of a Floating Life, which may be somewhat related to the "newly discovered" two records.</p>
<p>According to Zheng, he also heard that a famous old writer discovered the two records in Suzhou. The old man passed by a tea farmer's field and saw a farmer reading it. After borrowing it to read, he was shocked to find that it was the entire Six Records of a Floating Life. In surprise, he borrowed it for a day and read all six records. He deeply believed that it was still written by Sanbai. So he rushed back to Shanghai and signed a publishing contract with the World</p>

(Mi Xilin) Bureau. When he returned to Suzhou again, the farmer had taken it and moved away, and his whereabouts were unknown. After searching for several months, he found nothing. The old writer couldn't help but be distressed, so he discussed it with my teacher Yimei, because his writing style was quite similar to Shen Fu, and he planned to rewrite the two records to the best of his memory. My teacher did not dare to agree and politely declined. As for the detailed circumstances of the World Book Company's publication of Six Records of a Floating Life, whether the two records were recovered or were forged by later generations, it is unknown.</p>
<h3>Recent Events at Peking University</h3>
<p>— Mi Xilin</p>
<p>Student organizations such as the councils of the three colleges of liberal arts, sciences, and medicine at Peking University, the Autonomous Association of the First Year, the Autonomous Association of the Preparatory Class, and the Departmental Association of the Economics Department have established the Peking University Student Commemorative May Fourth Preparatory Committee and will hold a May Fourth Commemorative Week. The program is tentatively scheduled as follows: May 1st is a science evening, May 2nd is a literary evening, May 3rd is a history evening, the morning of May 4th is various ball games, and the evening is a bonfire party. May 6th and 7th are drama evenings.</p>
<p>The Peking University "Peking Man" wall newspaper, in order to commemorate the "May Fourth" and promote its great spirit, is scheduled to hold a "May Fourth Historical Materials Exhibition" on that day. Newspapers, magazines, political associations, documents, private letters, and souvenirs related to historical materials are being actively collected.</p>

<h3>Introduction——"News World"</h3>
<p>— Ke Pei</p>
<p>——An excellent reporting publication</p>
<p>In the case of a lack of material conditions, a good publication can still continue to operate, which will make the editors and readers feel very happy.</p>
<p>First of all, I have to introduce some of the articles in this issue. Regarding the domestic war situation, there are Mo Hesha's "The Battle of Yan'an: Five Days and Six Nights" and Wan Zhaojing's "The Communist Army Around Jinan and Others," which clearly portray the war situation of the past month in the most concise writing style. Generally, when writing current affairs articles, one either thinks too highly of oneself or underestimates the other party. This not only easily loses the truth of the current situation, but also often plunges the reader into a fog. Here, one can stand on an objective position and report based on facts, which is very commendable. The political insider story is Song Zhongtang's "Several Big Guns in the Third Plenary Session," which not only objectively reports the facts, but also portrays the personalities of several representatives. The Taiwan incident that occurred a month ago and the Dalian takeover issue that attracted worldwide attention are also reported in detail here. The rest, such as "British Virgin Queen Elizabeth" and "Cucumber Peeling Season," are light and meaningful, with endless aftertaste.</p>
<p>I am very excited to have finished reading every article in this issue. Here, you will discover things you didn't know. Although it can't be called a good teacher, it is enough to be a beneficial friend. Naturally, shortcomings are still unavoidable. A reporting publication should preferably be coordinated with time. Taking this issue as an example, articles such as "The Battle of Yan'an: Five Days and Six Nights" and "Taiwan: An Artificial Typhoon" all happened a month ago. Wouldn't it be better to see them sooner? Therefore, if economic conditions permit, we very much hope that "News World" can be changed to a bi-monthly publication.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Circle</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>Mr. Su Shilin, a famous vocal music professor at the Nanjing National Academy of Music, held a solo concert in the capital on the 2nd of this month, performing world-famous songs and famous opera works.</p>
<p>The National Shanghai Conservatory of Music has decided to hold its first joint teacher-student concert since the restoration of the school after the victory at the Lyceum Theatre on the 18th and 19th of this month. The program for this performance is extremely exciting. In addition to selecting outstanding students to participate, famous professors from the school, such as Magrinski, Lacha Donv, Lebrun, Ying Shangneng, and Chen Youxin, will also participate in the performance. It is reported that the ticket prices are set at 20,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The presidents and academic affairs officers of the Nanjing National Academy of Music, the National Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and the Fujian Conservatory of Music will hold a joint meeting in Beijing to discuss the establishment of student proficiency and curriculum standards in order to strictly implement them and cultivate outstanding musical talents.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuanyin, a famous lyric tenor in China, has recently been hired by the Ben Shi Zongyi Film Company to serve as the male lead in the singing part of the new film "Lucky Person, Auspicious Appearance" produced by the company, singing a theme song and two interlude songs. Mr. Huang is about to go abroad as a member of the music visiting group organized by the Municipal Music Association. This is his parting commemorative work before going abroad.</p>
<p>The Municipal Symphony Orchestra will hold its second public performance after the reorganization at the Lyceum Theatre on the 11th of this month. Professor Fu Hua will still serve as the conductor. The program is richer than last time. Since the group has been managed by the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the lineup has been neat and brand new.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of the Heavenly Music Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Lei Ke</p>
<p>The Heavenly Music Pavilion of Wing On Company has been closed since May 1st for the sake of "maintaining morality." It is said that the 600 employees of the building have been trapped inside for five days, and their usual savings have been exhausted. Now, all the food they eat is supplied by sympathetic people. A reporter went to inspect and saw men, women, old and young living together, wives crying and children wailing. The scene was so miserable that people couldn't bear to look at it. It is foreseeable that these 600 employees and their families will have to go hungry under this state.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Music Pavilion's harm to morality is well known. And it has been harming for a long time. Why is the boss suddenly reversing his previous behavior and wanting to maintain morality now? However, people always have an upward heart. We can't say it's bad for the boss to want the Heavenly Music Pavilion to abandon evil and return to righteousness, but the problem lies with the 600 employees and their families. The boss has abandoned evil and returned to righteousness, but the employees' livelihoods have been cut off. The employees' usual duties are not necessarily related to morality, but when the boss wants to close the business and they all ask for an extension, they are tantamount to asking to maintain the business that harms morality, as if the boss wants to run on the right path, and they are dragging him into the evil path. If we can look a little further, the employees should really give up this request.</p>
<p>But the problem of eating is more serious than that far-sighted vision. Once the business is closed, they will have to go hungry. The employees have no savings, so naturally they cannot maintain it for long. The supply from sympathetic people is not much, and it cannot be maintained for long. In this situation, only the boss can take into account the past relationship between the host and the guests. Over the years, he has made so much money from these employees. He must make a big decision and think of a way to open up a path to life for them.</p>
<p>There are really many places like the Heavenly Music Pavilion that need a renovation movement to "maintain morality." For many years, many people have been doing some kind of business that directly or indirectly harms society with the tacit consent of society. We all advocate stopping or innovating these things. However, the first condition is that the host must first find another way for those who rely on this for a living, otherwise the good flowers will not bloom, and the bad fruits will have already been formed. The tragedy of the Heavenly Music Pavilion is an example.</p>
<p>"Probably thirty-odd people." Zhu Zhaonian replied with a smile on his face.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Probably thirty-odd people? No! No! There must be an exact number! This is official business. How can you just say whatever you want!" Director Yu looked very disapproving.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian was caught off guard by this hurdle and was immediately speechless.</p>
<p>"Go back and get an official document! And a list of names!" Director Yu, with an iron face, shouted like he was dealing with a servant.</p>
<p>"But... but..." Old Zhu looked back at the clock on the wall, anxious and dizzy.</p>
<p>"This is official business!" the other party replied like a roar. Old Zhu got up and left. He knew that arguing with old yamen officials with such deep habits was a waste of time. Fortunately, there were still six or seventy minutes until five o'clock. He estimated that he could rush back to get an official document and bring it back in time, so he ran back desperately. Relying on the large number of people in the troupe, they actually managed to get the official document and the list of names together in a short time. - It was Zhang Chang who took the lead and wrote Zha and Fei Ji into the list.</p>
<p>Breathless, Old Zhu rushed back to the Traffic Bureau again. It was just twelve minutes before five o'clock. He rushed like a gust of wind to Director Yu's desk.</p>
<p>"The official document and the list of names are all here! Sorry, please process it quickly!" He pleaded with the Director, who was smoking and reading a newspaper, his voice trembling, and he couldn't control himself.</p>
<p>Director Yu slowly put down the newspaper, first picked up the envelope and looked at it for a minute or two, then took out the letter paper inside and looked at it three or four times; suddenly, his malnourished, withered brown face sank again, and at the same time, he shook his head repeatedly.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian's heart jumped.</p>
<p>"No! There is no official seal on the official document, we can't account for it!" Another reason that Old Zhu would never have expected.</p>
<p>"But we are a troupe, where would we get an official seal?" Old Zhu began to get a little angry.</p>
<p>"No, this is official business!" Again, two formulaic, unreasonable official words.</p>
<p>"Does that mean we have to temporarily carve one?" Old Zhu's eyes widened, his body leaning forward, staring tightly at the old civil servant who had lost most of his humanity. "But, your car is leaving early tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>"I can't control that, I only know official business!" The other party turned his face away, unmoved.</p>
<p>Now, Old Zhu really couldn't bear it any longer. He reached over and snatched the official letter from Director Yu's hand, immediately stood up, took huge strides, and rushed into Director Tai's office. (65)</p>
