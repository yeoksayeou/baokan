<p>問：台灣目前情勢如何，能詳告吾？白祟禧部長將赴台否？</p>
<p>答：過去三日來，台灣已迅速恢復平靜。日內即可完全無事，凡台理之政治經濟改革，政府無一不樂於實施，對於事件之處理亦力從寬大。蔣主席已於十一日明白宣示，唯吾國即將進入憲政時期，國民之能負責任，守紀律爲民主憲政成功之前提，如要求取消台灣警備司令部，繳卸武器及台灣陸海軍皆由合灣人充任，顯爲不負責任，不守紀律之言動。以此而求民主憲政，將不但如綠木求魚，且後必有災。此吾人所當共同灤省者也。白部長日內即可赴合灣宣慰，並權宜處理。</p>
<p>問：目下之軍事情勢如何？</p>
<p>答：（一）東北方面林彪所部共軍，集結於通化一帶似蠢蠢欲動，唯其所部系統複雜，思想紛歧，故戰鬥力不强。（二）河北方面共軍聶榮臻部，自大同慘敗後，曾在易縣滿城一帶整編，現東開大城附近，似欲有所舉動，以應援陳毅，但實力未充，不能發生作用。（三）冀魯豫邊區共軍劉伯誠部，前在隴海綫損失甚大，現在范縣陽　補訓中。（四）魯中方面，陳毅所部集結在蒙陰·新泰·萊蕪·泰安·等地·南上國軍進展甚速，已於九日收復曲阜·阜陽等地。中共雖誇大宣傳其擾亂力量之廣大，但中國三十六省區單位中，有實際軍事行動者，共約六七單位而已。</p>

<p>〔聯合社南京十二日電〕外次劉鍇今日對美國務卿反對蘇聯建議將中國問題列入莫斯科外長會議議程一節表示歡迎，並稱：此舉爲實現對中國政府之保證。</p>
<h3>美英法一致主持正議　蘇聯建議被否決　外長會不討論中國問題</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處莫斯科十一日電〕四國外長會議，蘇方提議將中國問題列入議程一節，法國代表亦予以反對後，本日英，美代表同意，對中國局勢，在外長會議塲外，與蘇聯作非正式之討論。蘇外長所提之第二建議，即蘇聯，美國及英國，以一九四五年十二目外長莫斯科宣言簽字人之資格，在外長會議塲外，考慮中國局勢，並發表公報一節，亦遭否決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十一日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾今日已略感安心，獲得英外相貝文與法外長皮杜爾之協助，卒　蘇聯之討論中國問題動議予以挫毀。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫在美，英，法三國外長聯合施壓下，遂收回該一提案。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十一日電〕美國務鄕馬歇爾，十一日于外長會議發表聲明，原文如下：「一九四五年十二月，莫斯科會議中發表之三國對中國聲明，並非外長會議聲明，而實乃蘇聯，聯合王國及美國三外長之聲明，余誌爲倘于會議鐵程中列入有關中國之事項，而中國以會議會員國一員之地位，不出席且不參加關於議程之決定？以及其後任何討論，實屬不當。莫斯科聲明，僅係聲明三國對華立塲，尤其關於兩國對彼此駐華部隊之立塲者，余頗願意在莫斯科之時日，然不在外長會議中。與莫洛托夫及貝文兩位先生，交換關於執行莫斯科聲明中任伺條款之報告」。</p>
<p>〔又電〕馬歇爾十一日在其主持之會議中，拒絕在外長會議中無中國代表參加而討論中國問題。皮社爾稱，若無中國參加而討論中國問題，實欠公平。莫洛托夫解釋謂：會議旣然不同意將此提議列入議程，彼亦不堅持。貝文表示，可非正式談論此一問題，但不願參與發表公報。貝文坦白表示，若無中國參加，則不願談論中國問題。貝文發言後，莫洛托夫即未表示意見。今日之會議繼續三小時廿分，十二日之會議，將於下午四時開始。</p>

<h3>谷壽夫判決書要點（續）</h3>
<p>姦淫　日軍陷城後，更四出強姦，一逞淫慾，　外僑所組國際委員會統計，在廿六年十二月十六日十七日兩日，我婦女遭日軍蹂躪者，巳越千人，且方式之離奇慘虐，實史乘所未前聞。如十二月十三日，民歸陶湯氏，在中華鬥東紅厚里五號被日軍輸姦後，剖腹焚屍，懷胎九月之孕婦蕭余氏，十六歲少女黃桂英，陳二姑娘，及六十三歲之鄕婦，亦同在中華門地區慘遭姦污，鄕女丁小姑娘，在中華門堆草巷，經日軍十三人輸姦後，因不勝在慮，厲聲呼救，當被刀刺小腹致死。同月十三日至十七日問，日軍在中華門外，於强姦婦女後，復迫令過路佾侶續與行姦，僧拒不從，竟被處宮刑致死。又在中華門外土城頭南少女三人，因遭日軍强姦，羞憤投江自盡。凡我留京婦女，莫不岌岌自危，乃相率奔避於國際委員會會所劃定安全區，詎日軍岡顧國際正義，竟亦逞其　慾，每乘黑夜越垣入內，不擇老幼，摸索强姦，雖經外僑以國際團體名義，迭向日軍當局嚴重抗議，而日將谷壽夫等，均置若罔聞，任使部屬肆虐如故。</p>
<p>焚燒　再日軍鋒鏑所至，焚燒與屠殺，常同時並施，我首都爲其實行恐怖政策之對象，故焚燒之慘烈，亦無倫比。陷城之初，沿中華門迄下　江邊，遍處大火，烈熖燭天，半城幾成灰　，我公私財產之損失殆不可數計。中華門循相里房屋數十幢，均遭燒殺，居民何廣森，夏鴻貴，畢張氏待數百人，盧舍成墟，　息無所，中華門，釣魚巷，湖北路，長樂路，雙閘鎮各處，居民遭有年，常許氏，馮兆英等房屋數百幢，亦俱焚燒，蕩然無存。至十二月廿日，復從事全城有計劃之縱火暴行，市中心區之太平路，火熖遍佈，至夜未熄，且所有消防設備，悉遭刦掠，市民有敢營救者，盡殺無救。</p>
<p>劫掠　日軍更貪婪成性，舉凡糧食，牲畜，器皿，古玩，莫不刦取，如在石壩街五十號，搶掠國銀石鐵軒名貴書籍四大箱，字　古玩二千餘件，木器四百件，衣服三十餘箱。又在集慶路，任管巷等處，掠刦民間牲畜，糧食，錢財，不可勝計。即國際紅十字會病院內護士財物，病人被褥，難民食糧，亦遭洗刦一空。美大使館職員陶格拉斯晋欽·美籍女敎士格舊絲苞爾，德人烏拉比巴赤德波濮羅蒸姆生等住宅，並經先後搜刦，損失　量。種種暴行，更屬難數。日本投降後，谷壽夫在東京被捕，經行我駐日代表團解送來京，由本庭檢察官偵查起訴。（理由從略）（完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>經濟參謀本部的設置</h3>
<p>負有復興我國戰後經濟建設使命之最高經濟委員會，於卅四年十一月廿六日成立；然一年以來，國家的一切均未回復平時的正常狀態，距離復興建設的前程，尚有相當迂迥的路徑。故該會的組織法立法院旣未通過；論其性質，又多少與各主管部門相衝突。在國家力圖緊縮預算，厲行裁汰的今日，是否有其必要，也頗值得考慮。但政府爲實施經濟緊急的措施，於本月四日行政院例會席上，又決議將最高經濟委員會改爲全國經濟委員會，變更原有的使命，擴大現在的職掌，已經六日之國防最高委員會將該會組織條例草案通過，正送立法院完成立法程序中。我們從經濟學曁世界經濟趨勢看，一國最高的經濟行政組織，應爲一國的經濟參謀木部，地位重要，意義深長，何待多言。全國經濟委員會之組織是否將負起此種使命，自爲一般國民所關心。今值立法院正縝密研討該會組織條例草案，尚未完成三讀程序之際，我們願略抒所見，以供參證：</p>
<p>一，關於經委會之組織：最高經濟委員會之組織，依條例所示，委員會設委員長一人，由行政院院長兼任，副委員長一人，由副院長兼任，經濟農林糧食各部長爲當然委員，並得由國府指派五人爲委員，另設參事秘書及專門委員，分組辦理各項職務：必要時幷得延聘中外專門人員爲顧問參議。依此組織條例所示，該會雖似完全爲一行政機構，但直隸國民政府，提有行政全權之治權機關却無從干預，是其制度本身是否應予採行，不無審愼考慮必要。今次改制，名稱旣易爲「全國經濟委員會」，體制復改隸於行政院，此在制度上，似較合理。至人員方面，除當然委員增加水利委員會委員長曁中央銀行總裁外，另有委員十人至廿人由國府遴派，似有網羅人才集思廣益之意，此在襄助經委會工作之推進；自是一種正確的舉措。惟此種組織形態，是否相等於經濟參謀部，不無可慮餘地。我們根據世界的經騐，和過去組織不合理的失敗敎訓，對於此項與全國人民經濟命脈息息相關的機構，似應廣泛遴選生產與消費方面之代表，和民問銀行公司企業代表人參加，幷應包有經濟專家及民意機關代表。庶能綜合各方意見，而能達成其所負的任務。</p>
<p>二，關於經委會之任務：最高經濟委員會之任務，依條例所示，自的爲完成經濟復員，提高人民生活；對全國資源作充分有效之利用，決定主要經濟政策，制定主要經濟計劃方案，聯繫經濟各部門工作；其權力實至强大。然而事實所昭示，年來國內經濟狀態如何，未必全如我們的理想。今次最高經委會改制，不僅要在組織上人事上，破除官僚主義的作風，允需在任務上，實施並完成民主的計劃經濟。據聞今後之全國經委會，除負有「最高經濟委員會」職掌外，並主持「特定經濟措施之推動」，如物價管制，輸入管理，輸出推廣等，最近行政院通過「全國經濟委員會物價委員會組織規程」，大的循此而來。我們以爲：組織條例可因情况變遷，必要時提出修改；但今後經委會之任務，似不可包羅萬象，職掌卻不可太過繁瑣，目前似仍應以推動經濟緊急措施，安定人民生活爲要務。同時經委會應爲諮詢的計劃的機構，其行政事務，應由主管部會執行者，仍應由主管部會執行。</p>
<p>總之，當前實施民族經濟政策，經緯萬端，非集思廣益，動員全國的智慧，實不能挽救嚴重的經濟危難。六屆三中全會轉瞬卽將集會，對當前經濟問題必有討論的決議，而國內經濟學者曁工商人士，關心時事，亦不乏珍貴意見，希望政府於三中全會後，能够博採衆議，來挽救我們當前的經濟危難。</p>

<h3>扶助自由民族抵禦外患　美具有重大決心　杜魯門昨在兩院聯會闡明政府立塲</h3>
<p>對希土兩國決予經濟援助</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：杜魯門總統凖備向國會發表演說，其演詞已預先交各報，內容如次；</p>
<p>「目前世界形勢的嚴重，已使本人不得不出席兩院聯席俞議，我所要提请各位注意以及決定的問題之一，是希臘和土耳其問題。美國頃自希臘政府接獲緊急經濟援助的請求。目前在希臘考察的美國經濟代表團以反駐希美大使的報告，蹬明希臘如果要繼續成為自由的國家，這種援助是必需的。我不相信美國人民和國會對於希臘的請求，將會「置若罔聞」。希臘不是一個富有的國家。由於天然資源的缺乏，希臘人民不得不拼命苦幹，從一九四〇年以還，這勤儉與愛好和平的國家，接連遭遇到四年的內憂外患。當解放軍開入希臘時，他們發覺撤退中的德軍已把所有鐵路，公路，交通工具和商船等盡行破壞，鄉村被燬者一千餘處，兒童百分之八十五均患肺結核，牲畜家禽幾全失蹤。通貨膨脹傳國民經濟宣告破產。此種悲慘景象足以造成政治混亂，而使經濟復興無實現可能。希臘今日缺乏資金以輸入生活必需品。在此種情形下，希臘人斷不能解央其建沒問題。希臘現亟需經齊援助，俾能繼續購買糧食，衣服，燃料，種子等，這是國民生計所不可少的，而且只能從外國購得。希臘必需得到援助，以輸入恢復國內秩序和安全所不可少的物資。現在，希臘國家的生存，已為恐怖份子活動所威脅，由共黨領導的武裝人員向政府叛變，尤其是在北部邊境一帶。安理會調查團目前正在實地考察希臘北部動亂的情形。希臘政府現在不能應付局勢，希臘軍隊配備不良，人數也少。假使政府要在領土內恢復權力，就非要配備不可。希臘如果要做一個自尊自足的民主國家，就必須人家援助，美國必須提供這種援助，因為希臘已經無法從別國得到援助，以前英國曾經給予若干援助，但是現在因為自顧不暇，所以從三月三十一日起將中止這一方面的協助。我們曾經老慮到如何促使聯合國去援助希臘，但是因為目前的迫不及待，聯合國恐怕很難有所作為。</p>
<p>「希臘的鄰邦土耳其也値得我們注意。作為獨立國家的土耳其的前途，在全世界愛好自由人士視之，其重要性決不决於希臘的前途。今日土耳其國內的情形和希臘大不相同。土耳其並沒有遭遇像希臘所遭到的災難，而且在戰爭期間英美兩國會給予土耳其以物質援助，但土耳其目前仍需要我們援助。自戰爭以來，土耳其曾向英美兩國覓求經濟援助，以達到保持其國家完整所必需之現代化，而此國家完整為維持中東秩序所絕對必要者。</p>
<p>「美國外交政策就是要創造一種環境，使我們和其他各國人民可以共同自由工作，不受威脅。最鈑世界上若干國家都受到極權國的威迫。對於違反雅爾達協定在波蘭，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞三國的一切威嚇行為，美國曾經屢次提出抗議。援助自由民族抵抗外來壓力。必須是美國的政策。</p>
<p>「我們假使不能在這重要關頭援助希臘，那末，西方與東方都將受到重大的影響。因此，我請求國會授權以四萬萬美元借給希土兩國，至一九四八年六月三十日截止。」</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十一日電〕美國國會今進備接受社魯門總統明日將概述之建議，並支持其政策，即不僅協助希臘，並在世界各重要區域支持民主並抑制共產主義之　　。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十一日電〕參院共和黨外交政策領袖范登堡頃談稱：美國　　干涉希臘局勢，以防止共產黨加以控制一事，或將引起美國援助其他「友好」國家之反應，演成蘇聯共產黨主義與西方民主政治間之戰爭，尤其是中國與朝鮮，故范登堡亦與其他議員意見相同，要求杜書門總統向國會聯合會議要求援助希臘時，應請其閘明干涉希臘局勢與美蘇關係之影響云。</p>
<p>白宮醫師宣布總統亟需休養</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：本日下午一時（東方標準時間）杜魯門出席國會非常聯席會議，宣佈其經濟援助希臘以制止南歐共黨勢力之計劃以前不久，白宮宣佈杜氏私人醫矚其立刻擺晚公務，作短期休養。白宮稱：杜魯門在國會發表演說後，即自華盛頓啓程前往佛羅里達歧惠斯特小憩。社氏演說將歷時二十分鐘，堪稱戰後尖國外交政府最重要之宣佈，將由無綫電及電視廣播世界各地。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾提出建議統一德佔區經濟　摧毀德戰力問題美蘇起激辯</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科十二日廣播：外長會議今舉行第三次會議，美方提出德境四佔領區經濟統一之建議。英外相貝文向莫洛托夫大興問罪之師，綠蘇方曾指英國　藏納粹戰爭罪犯，為報復計，貝文特在今日會議中向莫洛托夫問蘇聯處理德戰俘眞相，詞鋒銳利，滔滔不絕。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十二日電〕馬歇爾在外長會議中所提之德國經濟統一案，乃根據貝爾納斯之原議。按貝氏之建議，乃為在盟國柏林管制委會指導之下，成立工業，財政，糧食，農業，國外貿易與交通運輸等六處中央機關，各佔區常局不加以過問，然蘇聯從未與接受。今馬歇爾之提案，除少有增補外，完全依照貝氏之原議。蘇聯表示願意接受整個德國經濟統一之建議，然要求各佔區當局需有權加以控制，美方則認為如此即將損減統一之效果。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十二日廣播：四國外次今於在航空俱樂部開會，分組處理德奧問題，德國組在美國務院專家墨飛主持下，將盟國管制委員會之德國調查報告加以簡的，俾　强在下午討論肅淸德國納粹勢力及德國民主化問題時，可以加速進行。奧國組由美國克拉克主席，檢討奧國政治上之因難問題。</p>
<h3>解除德武裝　蘇建議四點</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十一日電〕莫洛托夫今日在外長會議提出下列諸點，以迅速完成解除德國武裝之工作。（一）外長會應訓令柏林盟管會於一九四七年七月一日以前、擬具消滅德國戰爭工業之計劃，至遲於一九四八年年底以前必須完全實行，對於淸理德國之托辣斯機構等點，尤其應予特別注意。（二）銷毀德國之一切戰具及德國土地內之一切陸海空軍設備，此項工作應於九四九年年底以前全部完成。（三）於一九四七年六月一日以前，解散德國一切軍事部隊，包括輔佐部隊在內。（四）解散德國境內之一切非德人部隊及集居營，依盟管會前此之決議，將此等人員遣返本國。</p>
<p>〔聯台社于莫斯科十二日電〕美國在外長會議中決心爭取蘇方同意德國經濟早獲统一，並以弦外之音，警告蘇方如不應諾，則將减少其所獲德國充作賠款之工業設備。美國政策趨勢，於外長會議着手討論異常複雜之德國問題時，已顯而易見。</p>
<p>美蘇意見大相逕庭</p>
<p>會議甫告開始，東西國家意見已大相逕庭。蘇外長莫洛托夫立即抨擊美英在德國西境佔領區之行為，切言各該佔領區內解除德方軍備及摧毀其戰爭潛在力－重工業－均難令人滿意。法外長皮杜爾僅聲明該國特別關切使德國永無行動力量。英外相貝文認為解除軍備工作，進行頗為順利。美國務卿馬歇爾之言最長，稱聯合國對德管制委會會所提解除軍備報告書，頗可滿意，摧毀德國重工業戰爭潛在力，則進行不力。但按照波茨坦協議，拆除德重工業設備充賠款，須待德境四佔領區經濟統一，方能竣事。如果德國經濟仍不統一，其工業水準自需較諸經濟統一時為高云。</p>
<p>現在兩途任蘇抉擇</p>
<p>馬氏此言用意，似乎僅留兩途，以待莫洛托夫抉擇，即參加某種種經濟制度，使德國東西兩區經濟平衡，否則美英兩國不願拆除德國多數工廠，充作對蘇賠款。雙方意見分歧，究至何種程度，可於莫馬兩氏所提建議見之。莫氏建議擬定特殊計劃，限期迅速摧毀戰爭潛在力。馬氏則主張對於解除軍備，承認已有「重大進展」，並循業已樹立之路綫，完成任務。雙方意見旣告分歧，蘇方建議將棘手之中國問題用入會議議程，遂被馬氏所阻。</p>
<p>貝文投下外交爆彈</p>
<p>會議揭幕日，馬氏曾建議將歐洲佔領軍限額問題，列入議程，莫洛托夫要求暫緩決定，現此建議亦在未決之列。會議激烈對論解除軍備問題時，員文投下外交爆彈，謂若知德境以外現仍被縈之職俘人數，「成者不無列途」云。關於此事，前已屢次提出結問，然蘇方均不置答，從未說明蘇聯境內究有德俘若干，貝文是否擬追問到底，尙未可知。</p>
<h3>魯爾區問題美法交換意見</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十二日電」非正式方面謂，馬歇爾國務卿今日曾與法外長皮杜爾就魯爾區工業之管制交換意見，馬歇兩曾表示魯爾工業雖宣由國際予以政治的管制，但此等工業之所有權，必須屬諸德國人。此間人士認為馬卿此一解明，僅足表示美國對於魯爾工業所採之立塲仍未變更，與法國之意見仍相逕庭。然另一說則謂，此項聲明可以顯示美國已有覓取妥女協之意，以調和前此之美國政策及最近法政府關於魯爾之建議。按此項意見的交換，並不在外長會議議程以內。</p>
<h3>特里波里問題　將舊事重提</h3>
<p>英主張歸國際管理</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十二日電〕此間英國人士預料一九四五年九月外長會議所提出之特里波里坦尼亞（北非前義舊屬地）問題，即將當事煎提。按蘇聯前曾要求將該地交其託管。又據此間消息靈通人士稱，英國對此立傷極為微妙，規惟希望能將該地列為國際軍略託管地？</p>
<h3>前日委治島問題　英仍持異議</h3>
<p>主張各國經濟機會平等</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十二日廣播：安全理事會今日下午召開會議時，英代表賈德幹再度反對美方代管太平洋前日本委治島嶼六百二十三處。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十二日電〕英國賈德幹爵士稱：英國對美國託管太平洋前日本委治島嶼之計劃，將提出新抗讓，在華盛頓請求之下，安理事將於今日下午三時集會，俾迅速通過美國之託管計劃，屆時賈德幹將提出異議，其反對之要點在於美國計劃中之經濟部份。致於軍率與行政郃份則並無異議。英方吧稱經濟機會平等之原則，此點係聯合國戰略託管恊定所規定者，在任塲合上必須嚴格遵守云。</p>
<h3>美對韓政策　將較以前更積極</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕副國務卿艾克遜今日向報界宣稱：國務院正依照馬歇爾之訓令，進一步探討朝鮮局勢。艾氏此言似支持該院帮助希爾特林昨日演說，暗示蘇聯拒絕援助朝鮮統一後，美國或將推展一種新的臨時計劃，較以前更為積極。若干方面認為此種言論與設立朝鮮南部獨六政府有利，並暗示美國正考慮在鮮南設立「臨時獨立政府」。</p>

<p>艾德禮闡明英對埃政策</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十一日電〕艾德禮首相今晶在下院答反對黨議員前外相艾登之間稱：埃及總理前此為英埃肢判破裂事，曾發表聲明，指出破裂原因係因埃及就下更兩點，不能獲得滿意。（一）英軍自埃之撤退，必須為無條件的立即全部撒退；（二）保持埃及與蘇丹之統一，恢復埃及在蘇丹之行政權，以籌備蘇丹之自治。關於第一點，英政府在貝文與埃前總理蔴特基所成立之協定中，已同意於一九四九年撒畢駐埃全部英軍，英軍前此在埃負有重大責任，今自該國撒退，鳥需相當時日，故一九四九限期之規定並不為過。關於第二點，英外相已明由表示英政府贊成蘇丹之有自治政府，並於時機屆臨以後，應使蘇丹人有完全之選擇自由，或完全獨立，或與埃合併，英國政府並不擬使蘇丹脫離埃及。然蘇丹民族，亦並非與埃人完全同種同文同教，蘇丹人民係許多種族所紐成，人口總計七百萬，並非回教徒或操阿拉伯語，職是之故，蘇丹人民之自由選擇權，實為必要云。</p>
<h3>調查匈內政事　蘇聯拒絕英美建議</h3>

<h3>世界語言　英語最通行　次爲中國語　美專家主張改良拼法</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十一日電〕世界語言學會最近發表報吿書，主張「一個世界，一種語言」主義，人人倘若學習同一語言，則事事將簡單化，全世界英語最通行，操英語者達四萬萬以上人散佈全球。其次為中國國語，操此語者達二萬萬人。英語雖甚普遍，却非統一世界之語言，外國人學習英語艱難，甚至本國人學習拼法亦非多年苦功不辦。該學會會長歐文主張採用新字母，手訂寰球適用之三十七個字母，代表任何種語言中之每一種聲普。每個字母代表一種聲音，故英語蘇川此種字母即可在數月之內學成。發音學專家勞巴克則別有見解，主張保留原來廿六個字母，僅改良其拼法。別種語言都能如此，英語又何獨不能。英文字典中，約有百分之二十應予修改，使其拼法與讀音完全相同。例如Though，Tough，Cough，Plough，Through應改拼為Thoa，Tuf，Kawfi，Plow，Throo。如此則eeze　enuf　for　anibodi(人人容易學習了）。</p>

<p>混合雙打</p>
<p>（一）安維與屈洛拉夫人對曾宏然與葉競雄小姐作混合雙打賽，安屈兩人搭擋較密切，故分數領前，第一局十五比十勝。　第二局在安等獲八分後，曾葉方開始急追，連得六分，安屈亦不放鬆，十五比八再勝。</p>
<p>安維　屈洛拉　（十五比十十五比八）　曾宏然　葉競雄</p>

<p>籃球聯賽甲組三幕，今晚六時起，賡繼在市體育館角逐，甲一部兩塲，豚有緊張精彩塲面，六時汕隊對春茂，勝負能影響冠軍，八時仁餘對海陸靑，則為名位之爭，門票仍售二千及三千，秩序錄次：</p>
<p>汕隊－春茂（甲一）六時</p>
<p>甲申－鐵路滬（甲二）七時</p>
<p>仁餘－海陸靑（甲一）八時</p>
<p>汕隊春茂之開鑼戲，與甲一部錦標頗有出入，春茂六三勝三負，固無問津希望，但汕隊則每仗俱捷，奪標呼聲極高，對此戰異常重視，馬燦希蔡演雄足智多謀，定有妙計定天下，而陳淸江·何立德·林維聰之剽悍，猶其餘事。春茂曾冷門突出，擊退華聯盟主，亦非「好惹」之流，惟主將劉福善受傷，能否出場尙成問題也。</p>
<p>第二塲甲二部甲申對鐵路滬，勝負得失無關重要，壓軸甲一部仁餘對海陸靑，番軍日前遭恩卡斯毒手後，前途黯淡，仁餘在此組中，今日係最後一戰，當能發揮其優良球藝，與番將　鬥一塲。</p>
<h3>談參加世運</h3>
<p>— 吳邦偉</p>
<p>我國應該參加明年在英國舉行的第十四屆世界運動會，照理不成問題，中華全國體育協進會亦正在準備，只要經費有着，一切自可順利進行。作者所要提出討論的，不是參加與吾的問題，而是如何確定我們的目的，因而計劃一種適當的辦法，務使這次參加世運，對於我國的現在與將來，確有若干裨益。</p>
<p>我們旣估計自己的力量，在世運會中很難有得勝的機會，而且我們明知道世運的終極目標，並不在錦標的得失，於是我們參加這次世界運動會，應該另行假定一個目的。</p>
<p>記得十年前到柏林參加第十一屆世界運動會的時候，我們在歐洲各國經過，大家以為我們是日本人，等我們說明是中國人時，他們非常驚奇，而感甚大的興趣。從這個經歷中，可見我們對歐洲各國實在太隔膜了。這次勝利以後，我們正好趁着他們腦海中對中國有很深的印象，而希望進一步知道中國和中國人的一切的時候，去給他們一個滿意的宣揚，藉以增進彼此間的友誼與瞭解。關於這一層，似乎離體育很遠，而是大家明白的，姑置不論。</p>
<p>中華全國體育協進會曾討論到邀請世運會於一九五六年，到中國來舉行的問題，我們確有發出此項邀請的資格與需要，因為我們是世界四强之一，我想世運委員會亦一定樂於接應這個邀請的。問題是我們對世運的舉辦，實在知道的太少了。譬如說，在我們所熟悉的幾種遝動，如田徑賽，游泳，足球，籃球等，我們或者還可以勝任愉快，然而此外還有若干種運動呢？有許多只是聽到過，而沒有見識過，有許多或者見過、但是不知其詳。在這種情形之下，如果世運曾眞開到中國來，我們將如何辦理呢？</p>
<p>所以，我們參加這次世運，志不在錦標，而要利用這機會，增進國際間的關係，同時要學習世運會各種活動的組織與方法，來做我們主辦第十六屆世運會的準備。根據這種目的，這種看法我以為我們派往世運會的代表團，必須有很多的人員，整齊的陣容，而決不是像十屆世運時一個運動員，幾個職員，舉着國旗去裝點門面，亦不是像十一屆世運時參加七八種運動，忽略了其他。</p>
<p>很多人從另一種觀點上，贊成只派足籃球隊和少數合格的田褪賽運動員去參加當然有充分的理由。然而為着前述的目的，我贊成普遍的遣送。我們除了足籃球和田徑賽以外，不是沒有人材可選，不過我們對於其他運動不甚注意，很少提倡，更沒有比賽的機會，這般人材也就埋沒不聞罷了。據我的推想，這種人材出席比賽時，他們的成績，不一定比足籃球田徑賽運動員與外國人成績比例差些。過去我們選拔運動員，一向從學校中或狹隘的運動圈裏去找，其實我們可以從軍警隊伍中找到射擊的能手，從農工勞力中找出舉重的健將，從國術界中找着拳擊摔角的良材，從其他特殊環境中找尋各種不同技能的人材。我們應該廣泛的徵求，訓練，使世運會的大多數或全部運動項目中，統有幾個運動員參加。一然後我們可以知道世運會的一切，踏進每一個國際競技運動組織的圈子。如果永遠故步自封，守着國內幾種普通的運動為已足，我們將永遠隔絕在國際運動的廣大範圍以外。</p>
<p>在派遣運動員以外，我們更須注意到指導員的人選。担任指導員的，自須對於所司的一項運動，在知識與技能上有相當的基礎。他們除領導指示運動員參加各種比賽，使運動員從比賽中獲得實際經騐與知能外，還應考察這項運動的建築設備的方法，組織管理的技術，並與各國際競技運動組織的主腦人員多接觸，多討敎，然後同國以後，可以領導這項運動，使他在國內發達起來。要是世界遝動會應邀開到中國來，他們就是與各個國際競技運動組織的技術人員合作的幹部。</p>
<p>至於選拔運動員，不論假全國運動會的機會，或單獨舉行一個預選會，均無不可，能兩者兼施並行更好，因為有許多運動項目未必能列入全運會中去。但是遴選委員會必須立即定出一個辦法來，委託各地方的體育塲，體育團體，學校，軍警機關，部隊，或個人，去物色我們所需要的人材，好好的加以訓練。在世遝註册截止前的相當時問，根據各人的技能來作一次最後的選定。這種選定是否需要標準，見仁見智，各有不同，則在主事者抉擇。區區之見，敢以供主持參加世運諸公約參攷。</p>

<h3>收購外銷華茶問題　昨已獲得解決方案</h3>
<p>仍照原定價格收購，但由中信局給予打包貸欵百分之一百二十。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕三十五年度外銷華茶之收購事宜，幾經茶商與當局洽商，未獲結果。昨日下午三時，洽談在中央銀行總裁室重行展開。出席有中央銀行副總裁劉攻芸，業務局副局長邵曾華，李筱莊，中央信託局沈熙瑞，中國農民銀行王伯天，周紀曜，茶葉協會壽景偉，茶葉輸出業公會孫曉邨，葉世昌，東南區茶塲聯合會吳覺農，平水區陶振聲，屯綠區洪涇五，祁門區陳受百等。經三小時之討論，終於獲致最後之解決方案。惟尚待　由行政院核定後，方能施行。預計因此而收購之外銷華茶，總額將達十萬擔。內包括洽妥押款之茶葉八萬　，及未洽妥之茶葉二萬檐</p>
<p>昨日決定之方案，仍係維持中央銀行之收購原案。惟按原定收購之中心價格，即平綠卅萬元，屯綠四十萬元，祁紅五十萬元，由中央信託局以打包放款之方式，給予百分之一百二十之貸款。該項貸款，應先償付各茶商在中國農民銀行七折作押之茶貸。至茶葉之推銷事宜，則決由中信局與各茶商合組聯營推銷委員會。中信局負監督之責，設法使所有茶葉，在三個月內推銷完畢。推銷所得利潤，按茶商七成，中央銀行三成之比例分配之。</p>
<h3>華股後市轉俏　散買光顧冷門</h3>
<p>華股昨多空角逐更烈，遞永紗形成拉鋸，祗百餘元起仆，終以銀根鬆濫異常，午後即交又係隔日交易，散買有恃無恐，臨收忽俏。</p>
<p>晨初見低，一九八號四七號四九號一八五號七八號有售，九四號九七號八五號則進，上塲時倍多盤旋，七六號進後即出，一八五號一五二號二二三號九一號八四號二三五號二二號亦賣，而將遞永紗迫低至三〇〇〇元關，一二號一四九號九四號二三二號三一號一七九號三二號一五五號一六二號俱進，國貨漲停，曾回漲到三一二〇元，九七號四號七六號二二〇號二〇七號二二三號一四八號一六七號紛加脫手，又回低至二九八〇元。一三三號二一八號一〇二號一八四號九四號等俱進，近午又迫近三一〇〇元關，午收仍盤，結果較前收計永紗美亞微挫，信和華豐跌半成强，景福新光動興新華各降一成，遞交計永紗美亞微降，信和華豐新光跌半成，景福降落一成不到，冷股統益中紡跌一成弱，國貨獨告漲停，大通新亞永公各升半成光景，餘者升降不一。</p>
<p>午後祇做即交，因係隔日交割關係，散買忽起活動，一九九號八四號一四二號二二三號四號二三一號一三三號三六號九四號均進，即告步漲，商務·永公·中法·大通·新亞·中絲·九福·美亞紛告漲停，人心大振。一九八號九七號二二四號六一號等雖賣，二〇七號再進，一再盤高至三三〇〇元。二一八號等逢高脫手，而後盤旋，結果較前收計永紗信和新華升半成，中法·美亞漲停，華豐·新光·勤興·景福微升。遞交祗半天交易，計永紗美亞微降，信和。華豐。新光跌半成，景福跌一成弱，冷股統益中絲商務國貨五和永公九福新亞漲停，餘者自微升迄一成不等。塲外各股聞南洋有上市訊，與中華同告急漲，餘亦見高。</p>
<h3>證券套利　王志莘現身說法</h3>
<p>近日股市上漲，各方極爲關切，上海證券交易所兼代總經理王志莘發表談話，茲據其有關套利者如下：</p>
<p>試行證券套利辦法。一方係便利握有剩餘資金者買進現貨，同時賣出遞交，以套取利息，而不負市價漲落之風險。另一方面便利證券投資人有所緩急時，得以放出現貨，同時買進遞交，以吸收淹動資金。除負檐額定之利息外，亦不負市價漲落之風險。允其目金鈔停止買賣後，一般有小額資金，原可購買金飾美鈔者，不得購買，用以套利，最爲便利。是以套利父勿運川得法，確有吸收剩餘資金，調劑短期金融，與利川資金供給平抑利率之作用。近來市息尚高，套息在七八分至二角半間。將來金融弛鬆時，資金湧至，套息自可見低。</p>
<h3>多方獲利出籠統債漲熱稍挫</h3>
<p>公僓昨漲後仍回，外行不斷吸收，但多方獲利出籠，成交達一千萬元，統丙晨開一二〇〇〇元高價一二六〇〇元，曾回低一〇九〇〇元，午刻在一一六〇〇元徘徊，收後减價見低一千元，結果較前收計甲乙跌七百元，丙種平穩、，丁降五百元，戊種亦小六百元。</p>
<h3>亞洲鋼業俏秀橡皮有求少供</h3>
<p>外股昨洋行帮吸收鋼業亞洲，兩者頗見秀色，午後得華股之助力，繼續向榮。橡皮股喊價仍高，有求少供，結果會德豐業廣尚平，鋼業軋漲一成，餘均徽升。</p>
<h3>外銷絕跡紗市續跌</h3>
<p>昨日紗市跌勢益勁，紗廠及紡建雖然無大量配出，然業中人鑒於外銷絕跡，一意傾售，買戶萎縮不前，致成一面倒之勢。念支紗又跌十萬至廿萬，輕磅雙馬低見三百廿二萬，僅較紡建掛牌高二萬，尚乏買主，廿支三羊低見二百九十七萬，略有去化，平均又跌五萬之譜。</p>
<h3>棉布云胃薄弱</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以隔日紡建公司供售籌碼充斥，而本街染廠及門莊進胃減弱，致細布一致下挫，自一千元至六七千元不等。十二磅龍頭細布價做十四萬九千五百元，軋小四千元，彩球十四萬四千元，軋小七千五百元。振中亦降七千五百元爲十三萬元。士林布去胄亦呆，一九〇美亭士林價爲三十六萬五千元，軋小九千元。鶵鷄。桃花女。俱降一萬元，爲三十五萬元。已屆銷令之漂布，亦因門莊家無進胃，價亦軋低三四千元。其餘藍布及斜紋布等，價俱　憊不振。僅府綢去化徵動，軋升四五千元。</p>
<h3>外商推選代戈　參加輸廣小組</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各外國商行代表，於昨晨十時起，假怡和洋行二樓召開會議，正式推選參加輸出推廣會十七小組之人選。今日繼績開會，代表三十四人之名單，明日可公布。按昨今兩日之會議，爲本市外商接受輸廣會之建　面召開者，完全爲外商本身之會議，並非如外傳之由輸出推廣會召開者，故開會之地點選在怡和洋行云。</p>
<h3>日本紗布經滬運港</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日要紗布，侵入南洋市塲，逐漸推進，最近已有二批經滬運港，再轉船運赴各埠，太古公司北海輪，亦由日本神戶載運棉紗二千七百五十件，人造絲五百箱，昨日抵埠，定今日在滬加裝少許新加坡貨後，即起椗南駛，日本運來之紗，原船運往仰光，人造絲運香港交卸。</p>
<h3>央行限制結滙辦法　進出口商困難重重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市進出口及皮毛油骨兩商業同業公會，昨日聯合招待本市新聞界，公開表示該業等目前困難情形。茲特摘誌如次：（一）中央銀行規定寄售出口結匯的期限，最長僅九十天，而目前因交通不暢，運歐美貨物，有需二三月以上才能到達，幾無餘日爲寄售之日期。且出口貨物，多有受時令性拘束之種類，結果將遭外商乘機殺價。（二）中央銀行規定之一九四六年十一月七日以前起運之出口貨，按照一九四七年二月六日以前之匯率結售外匯，不得李受現行匯率結售。出口商應得之利益，盡爲剝奪。（三）暹羅方面，仍無正式匯率，係由港幣轉結，而目前暹港方面，亦無正式比值，故限期結匯，實非事實所許可。（四）中央銀行本年二月廿八日發布對英匯率之規定，進出相差八千元之鉅，又無異剝削出口商利益，使已成交而未結匯之出口貨物，損失二成。（五）出口商對國外代理商的佣金，及代付一切的雜費，因中央銀行輒不准結匯，致無法匯付，影響出口商之國際商業信用。</p>
<h3>暹米出口辦法改善　本月將有大的比暹米運滬</h3>
<p>暹羅政府頃將購米制度改善，准許內地榖米流通，凡運購暹米出境者，並得有百分之十之自由英鎊，因此在暹之我國米商頗感方便，購米數量亦因此增多。聞三月份已分配我國過米一萬五千七百噸，短期內即可遝滬去。</p>
<h3>人絲喊價下挫</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市因配售繼續，塲內供過於求，故開盤後即見下挫。一二〇號高山初喊六百九十萬元，乏人過問，旋即退至六百七十萬元，有數箱交易，中間最小喊過六十萬。下午仍因求脫者多，最小價喊五十五萬元，但喊價過低，持貨者均不願割售，故最後喊價仍復回高，做七十萬元，結果比上日下降二十萬元。廠經市况較隔日更靜，大都並無做開。C字等級昨喊隔日做開價七百五十萬元，普通零擔喊七百十萬至二十萬元左右。干經高檔五擔貨喊六百萬元，决者的小四十萬元之譜，綢貨亦然淸寂，被面無做開，喊價照上日未更。大誠格璧縐稍有做開，初喊七千一二百元，最後做七千元。</p>
<h3>祁紅買賣岑寂</h3>
<p>邇來洋莊茶市，三十五年度祁門紅茶，市勢續居岑靜，良以目前英國各地雖有吸胃，惜嫌價格奇昂，故依然望茶興嘆。他若陳久多年之决綠茶，因不受國外埀愛，買氣已戢，過程殊爲淸閒。至於三十四年及三十五年度之綠茶，一片進風，則猶甚囂塵上。刻下午昌·華茶·大德昌·等茶葉公司，均曾與貨方磋商，但供求態度各趨堅持，交易不盛，行情一致盤旋，缺少變化，紅綠茶內銷，呆滯如故，人心徘徊。</p>
<h3>呢羢銷呆價昂　火姆四本活躍</h3>
<p>呢羢市面，昨仍成銷呆價昂之勢，賣方多憾進貨困難，買方則覺銷出爲艱，一般購買用戶，大半俱嫌昂貴，乏力添製，以致市價標準始終在穩定中徘徊。預測本客帮銷路得能進展時，呢羢行情勢必再度上升數級。火姆四本日來趨勢甚形活躍，大小西服裁縫帮，咸加問津，來路貨遠較本廠貨爲倘秀。本廠貨每碼批沽三萬五千元以至六萬餘元，來路貨頭號批沽二十萬元，二號十六七萬元，三號十萬元光景。</p>
<h3>台糖原價標售</h3>
<p>昨糖市以台糖公司今日標售額照八期配售，二四粗白三成十九萬元，四半軍百二成廿萬元，台赤五成十四萬元，故趨勢復軟。公會劃盤廿二號中砂白十九萬四千元，决之十九萬〇五百元，三半率白十九萬四千元，棧　十八萬八千元至六千元五干五百元，二四組呌二十一萬五千元，九期台赤棧單十四萬元。號貨汕提靑十三萬元，順德靑十二萬九千元至七八千元。上冰花白二十萬〇五千元，興化白十八萬五千元至三四千元，次與赤十三萬二千元至一千元。</p>

<p>〔又訊〕經濟部長王雲五，已定今日晚車來滬，預計明晨可到。王氏此來，聞將參加週五召開之紡管會例會，及週六召開之紡建公司董事會。紡建董事會議，將討論如何發歸民發，及發行股票方式云。</p>
<h3>本市造紙廠　月產量約五千噸　云年受外貨影響營業清淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據本市造紙工業同業公會調查：本市造紙工廠，純屬民營者有廿二家，其中以天軍，大中華，民幾，華豐，及華盛規模爲最大。海京及華安均在停頓之中。此外尚有大陸造紙廠（己拆），興業，利用，華麗，海峯，大同，（不在廿二家之列），均在停頓之中。去年各廠營業不振之原因，乃以外貨傾銷，及原料採購不勿之故。開工之工廠，亦不過製造運史紙包皮紙舛國產品，因此等紙類，不受外貨影響，故銷路尚佳。至於敵偽產業，自卅四年九月，由經濟部蘇浙皖特派員辦公處，造紙復工業委員會接收之大小紙廠，計十四家。其中除一部機件不齊，或原料缺乏，朱能開工外，其較大者爲大中華，櫻井，金星東廠及西廠，江南一廠及二廠，均已開工。現大中華及天章，已歸民營。新東亞已出租，上海加工紙廠，上海紙器株式會社、江南造紙第二廠，均已出售。其他各廠尚在處理之中。</p>
<p>各廠製品種類，隨市面之需要，而時常變更。大約有捲烟紙，各式紙版，運史紙，毛邊紙，牛皮紙，招貼紙，道林紙，白報紙，彩色紙，書面紙，三丁紙，打字紙，火柴紙等。每日產量，最小者一噸，殺大者三十餘噸，平均的五噸。查民營工廠對各種紙張最大之產量，合計爲九二八一噸，國營工廠爲五四〇噸。國民營工廠每月最大之總產量的九七二一噸，而實際產量以二分之一計，的五千噸。</p>
<p>如按每月造紙一萬噸，所需原料計：木漿五五五〇噸，破布四千噸，豆桿漿一五〇〇噸，廢紙一五〇〇噸，燒碱三八〇噸，松香二五〇噸，明礬七百噸，漂粉六百噸，榆木五百噸，煤斤二五七〇〇噸，電力一千五百萬度，毛毯三萬八千磅，銅絲布二萬平方尺。上列原料及材料，以木漿毛毯銅絲布需要舶來品。聞柬北及台灣有製造木漿工廠，亟廳籌備復工，以應國內之需要。</p>
<h3>染料頹勢難挽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕兩週以來，染料市况之鈍，實銷之淸，爲一年來所未有。買戶不敢吸納，賣生競相吐售。更以本市實銷亦稀，客帮以運輸情形，日益惡化，亦裹足不前。而內地價格，復多低於滬市，故至日前止，染料尚無腳地可言，每日價格必跌。據業中人云：客銷淸淡，固爲跌價原因之　一，但散戶買目風積，亦爲主要原因之一。上年染料　乏，紛紛競相　囤，及至價格軟化，囤戶復爭相出籠，故正常營業反而處於彼動。昨市三星灰每聽做價爲卅二萬至卅五萬元，六九三　化元，每擔六百萬元，十六號地字灰每斤卅五萬元，B．N．C．元靑每斤九萬元，三鴿皂黃每聽廿一萬元，略有成交，餘均無人問津。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕毛紡織工業同業公會，前爲貨物稅問題，屬决推派代表晋京向有關院部面陳該業種種困難情形，建讓改就毛紗徵稅，並請减低稅率。茲聞關於就紗徵稅，經行政院咨送立法院後，已於本月十一日提付大會修正通遇，稅率仍舊，不日即可公佈施行云。</p>
<h3>滬鬃國外獨秀　本市交易清稀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據猪紫出口商稱：紐約滬鬃市價，每磅爲美金二元一角，川鬃二元六角，漢鬃三元五角，因政府拋售戰前有鬃，除滬鬃交易尚多外，其餘天津，漢口，重慶，等猪鬃，均轉疲態。本市亦以滬鬃交易爲多，川漢鬃無人問津。昨市本地鬃每司馬担爲三〇〇萬元，漢口鬃爲五百萬元，）川鬃爲三百九十萬一元，漢口黑鬃配箱每浙寗担爲五百萬元，重慶黑猪鬃配箱爲二百四十八萬元。</p>

<h3>西子湖畔一盛會　中英美　飛將軍聯歡</h3>
<p>— 杭州九日快訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>三月七日，杭州蔚藍晴麗的上空，東北方向來了一架C四七的軍用機，她徐徐降落在筧橋空軍學校的機塲上，機門啟處，一個胖胖的蓄着濃黑鬆鬆的英國人，他含笑的站在門前，他是英國空軍中將鮑爾溫爵士E，A，Baldwin同來約有英國民航部的羅斯先生Charles　North和我國的空軍林偉成少將等兩人。空軍軍官學校教育長胡偉克將軍接待着他們參觀了我們的空軍學校，又遊覽了西湖名勝。</p>
<p>晚上，在西子湖泊濱的樓外樓設宴歡迎他們，順便談談杭州的風土人情。當時被邀參加這個宴會約有浙省府主席沈鴻烈先生，秘書長雷法軍先生，杭州市長周象賢先生，空軍美國民顧問溫先生，空軍官校政治部主任祝樞壽先生，空軍張楊兩主任，空軍美國總顧問克寧漢夫人，張楊兩夫人，空軍李成源副官，新聞界約有劉湘女先生和記者兩人。主人胡偉克先生和胡夫人，他們忙着為賓客們介紹姓氏，隨後我們團坐弄來，嗑着西瓜子。</p>
<p>鮑爾溫爵士是在第二次的世界大戰中卓著戰功的人，他在一九四二年春，計劃和率領英國飛機一千二百架轟炸萊茵河邊的重鎮柯侖。這在空軍大舉轟炸史上開了新頁。在談話中，他很謙遜的避免談到他的戰功，他總是以一種英國人特有的風度言笑着。</p>
<p>華筵敞開酒令盛　華筵盛開，鮑爾溫爵士和羅斯先生都很會喝酒，尤其是羅斯先生，他除了高興喝酒以外，並且還喜歡猜拳，被派坐在他旁邊的我，作為他唯一的敵手，當他兩次敗北後，說着「賭賭運氣看，」又來了一次，克寧漢夫人亦以記者為對象，她接受了周市長的參謀，所以連戰皆捷，但是每當她的勝利來臨時，她必舉杯一飲而盡。溫先生也很會喝，後來沈主席也痛飲了幾杯，那主人夫婦還有一個個殷勤勸酒，使到會的每一個人都感到無比的愉快和興奮。</p>
<p>一聲頂好讚空軍　酒興闌珊，我們重又品茗談笑，我問鮑爾溫爵士，「覺得我們中國訓練的空軍怎樣？」他撓起了大姆指說：「頂好！」接着又說：「胡教育長是我在印度時訓練空軍的老朋友，我曾和他密切合作過，我覺得中國這樣艱難的時代，空軍教育還是這樣克復物質的困難，不斷的前進，這是難能可貴的。譬如我親見從印度出發飛越駝畢的司蒂曼練習機，想不到現在還在使用，這實在是在艱苦中創造的一個例證。又如我在印度看見中國空軍的營中，遍植樹木，現在空軍學校也遍植樹木。這是胡先生一貫的作風，我們値得讚佩的」</p>
<p>胡偉克說受感召　溫先生在旁聽了，也插了一句：「我親見這種訓練空軍的另一作風，使我們無緣的欣慰。」羅斯先生笑着說：「眞好！」克寧漢夫人也說：「我們在中國訓練空軍的營裏，受着這種的影響，眞是十分的高興。」林偉成洗凈謙遜的說：「還靠大家幫忙呢？」胡偉克先生他有些不好意思起來說：「這一切都是受着校長的感召呢！」</p>
<p>中英民航簽協定　鮑爾溫接着滔滔不絕地談他此行的任務，因為他有很多很好的中國朋友，所以他熱愛中國，這次中英要訂立民航協定，他被派為代表團團長，他是樂於接受這個任務的。在南京，曾和我們的當局見了面，現在要到各地去考察，他到過上海，現在來杭州，翌晨仍飛回上海，再到南京，漢口，廣州，香港等地，再飛回南京，然後簽訂航空協定。他說，他很喜愛杭州，杭州這個地方有　　瑞士，雖然是地區並不大，但全城很乾淨。他又說像杭州這樣的地方，可以建設為理想的文化城池。因着他喜愛杭州，所以我們歡迎他再來，他說：「我事情辦完後，當設法再來的。」</p>
<p>邦交親睦大合作　在這一次宴會上，眞是中，英，美一部份空軍將領的聯歡盛會，大家談得很痛快，大家覺得中，英美的邦交應該更加親睦些，更加需要密切的合作，在平等互惠的原則下密切合作。</p>
<p>夜已深沉，賓客們尚留戀忘返，聽那湖濱的舟子在呌着「可以歸去」的聲音，才喚醒了這一羣客人；整了整衣裳，互道珍重而別。</p>
<h3>港政府決定　開征所得稅</h3>
<p>— 香港入日航訊　本報特約記者子健</p>
<p>這幾天來，本港在更換港督的聲中，社會上發生一個波動，由薪水階段以至富豪，都一律被捲入這個波動中。這個波動的緣起，就是港府決定開徴所得稅。這個重大的決定，差不多經過一年的醞釀了。</p>
<p>稅務部　積極籌備中</p>
<p>自從去年七月底港府宣佈一九四六年至一九四七年三月三十一日的財政年度支出一億六千餘萬，而收入僅五千餘萬，港府財政司便宣佈港府進行考慮繼續徵收一九四一年實行的戰稅或所得稅，當時已引起港中人士，不問中西，一致的嘩然。這個「考慮」因此沉默了半年之久，上月份，港府的機關忽然透露將於四月一日實行開徴所得稅的消息。在英倫埋頭研究一年以上早由英殖民地部委派的港府所得稅稅務司畢達萊，便在那個時候一聲不響來到香港，着手籌備他的稅務部。（Inland　Revenue　Department）。</p>
<p>港府為了彌補那一億多元的財政赤字，而減少英國納稅人對香港的負擔，開徴所得稅已勢在必行。但港中居民，為了維持他們「捉襟見肘」的生活，也勢難俯首就範。他們也許明知沒有什麼可以阻止港府執行這個「經濟緊急措施方案」的辦法，但不能不發抒已見，表示民間對官方的反響。</p>
<p>中外人一致表驚惶</p>
<p>「我寧愿跑進赤柱監獄，也不繳納所得稅！」這是一句很幽默的話，說話的當然不會是中國商人。另一個年靑的英國紳士也說：「因為屋宇奇缺，我祇好和我的太太長住旅館，我們剛好渡過難關，因為公司最近加了一些薪水給我，而且還加了一些生活津貼來補償我的不足，然而現在政府又要將我入息的一部份抽去了，那豈不是又要我重新鑽進牛角尖去？我現在所得的薪水增額及津貼都是空的，因為旅館的開支是驚人的高昂，但這是我唯一可能找到的居處了。」</p>
<p>我們僑胞的意見，有謂：「戰後本港正式商人，從事正當營業，大部份祇能維持門面，並無實利可圖。戰時的損失更無法補償，不比富有游資者，利用遊資以操縱市場，獲取厚利。政府開徴所得稅，繳納者祇有正式商人，而富人遊資，當能逃避。實在是極不公允。」有謂：「目前商塲不景氣，比去年更甚，開徴所得稅和營業稅，尚非其時。」有謂：「開徴所得稅，遭受其嚴重打擊者，以中等薪水階級為最。窮苦階不成問題，而富有階級，如最近由上海來港的暴發戶，因為他們大多數很難找得出他們有什麼的入息，所以他們總有辦法就會過去。」</p>
<p>對港府徴收所得稅的反響，僑胞方面似還不及外人那麼激昂。他們不是表示反對，却是認為戰後生活困難，徴稅尚非其時，或指為不公允。「人民有納稅的義務」，這個道理，我們的僑胞似比英人更為「了解」哩！</p>
<p>着眼點不在富有者</p>
<p>港府所得稅的開徴，所以引起居民熱烈的反對的，原因就是根據稅務司的披露，凡年薪在五千元以上者，將繳納至少百分之十四的稅！年薪五千，即月入四百，在今天的香港，僅足供一家五口之備，這是一個中等人家起碼的支出，假如再扣除了百分之十四，他們簡直無法生活下去！一個工人月入兩三百元，若無家室的負擔，要比一個月入千元的經理，過得更寫意的生活！所以港府除非把所得稅開徴的底額提高至相當數目，如五萬元或十萬元之數，把着眼點放在富有者身上，否則勢得引起更多的貪污和逃稅的風行。</p>
<p>所得稅戰稅第一步</p>
<p>一九四一年實行的「戰稅」，計分：（一）產業稅－依地價或屋價徵收百分之十四；（二）薪金稅－年入五千元徴百分之六，五千元以上，征百分之十四；（三）溢利稅－每年溢利五萬元徴百分之七，五萬元以上，徴百分之十四；（四）利息稅－徴百分之十上。這種「戰稅」是因徴募戰費而起，但和平已遍年豐，這種「戰稅」的條例，還未正式廢除。故若干社會名流，認為港府開徴所得稅，將為恢復開徴「戰稅」的第一步。其他三種戰稅，將必繼續執行。</p>
<p>港府為維持預算平衡，在未決定關徴所得稅之前，已開始增加其他的稅收，如水費，港口使用稅，領港費，燈塔旨，船舶寄碇費，都比戰前提高。此外，恢復印花稅和成葉稅，又開徴飲食稅，（每客五元以上，徴百分之十），和跳舞稅，港中居民直接間接的負担，實不為少。現在有人建議港府開徴奢侈品稅，發行彩票或公債，以代開徴所得稅。有人誠惶誠恐地想將來或有開抽「人頭稅」的一天？</p>

<h3>五院制度下　司法行政之掌理機關　最高法院全體庭長推事</h3>
<p>引言　自五院制度旅行以來，司法行政之掌理機關，屢生問題，法制上亦時有變遷，今憲法已公布矣，而司法行政究由何院掌理，未設明文，於是解之者又分兩說。聞國防最高委員會交立法院審議之行政司法兩院組織法草案，採由行政院掌理之說，是果副於憲法之本旨歟？茲略敍五院制度施行以來法制上之沿革，而論其得失，並就憲法上司法行政之掌理機關，加以研討。</p>
<p>五院制法制沿革</p>
<p>五院制度之施行，自十七年十月三日公布國民政府組織法始，同法第三十三條規定：「司法院為國民政府最高司法機關掌理司法審判司法行政官吏懲戒及行政審判之職權」，同月二十日公布司法組織法，依其第一條之規定，設司法行政署以為司法院組織分子之一。同年十一月十七日修正司法院組織法，改司法行政署為司法行政部。二十年六月十五日公布修正之國民政府組織法第三十七條規定：「司法院為國民政府最高司法機關掌理司法審判之職權」，司法行政是否全部由司法院掌理，未設明文，但在同法施行期間，司法行政部仍隷屬於司法院，及至二十年十二月三十日公布修正之國民政府組織法第二十四條第五款規定：「荐任以上行政司法官吏之任免應經行政院會議議決」，第三十五條第一項規定：「司法院為國民政府最高審判機關」第三十六條規定：「司法院高最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會」，由是司法行政部遂改隷於行政院。二十三年二月十七日公布修正之國民政府組織法將第二十四條第五款修正為：「荐任以上行政官吏之任免應經行政院會議議決」，將第三十五條修正為：「司法院為國民政府最高司法機關」，將第三十六條修正為：「司法院設司法行政部最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會」，於是司法行政部乃重隷於司法院。三十一年十二月十二日公布修正之國民政府組織法於第二十四條第五款增入司法兩字，於第三十六條刪去司法行政部五字，回復二十年十二月三十日所公布之原文司，法行政部遂又改隷於行政院，是即現行之制度也。惟關於審判機關之司法行政，司法行政部所掌理者，僅為關於高等法院地方法院之部分，所有關於最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會之司法行政，雖在司法行政部隷屬於行政院之時期，仍由司法院掌理焉。</p>
<p>兩院分掌之失策</p>
<p>五院制度發明於國父，國父手訂之建國大綱內，列舉行政院各部並無司法部或司法行政部之名稱，徴以國父在廣東設立大理院，所有現由司法行政部掌理之司法行政，即由該院掌理，可見司法行政不應由行政院掌理，乃國父之本意。建國大綱內，列舉行政院各部之無司法部或司法行政部，非漏舉也。然自五院制度施行以來，兩次修正國民政府組織法，將隷屬於司法院之司法行政部改隷於行政院，其原因安在，頗費思索。或曰：「司法院設部以掌理司法行政，即名該部為司法行政部，人見部之名稱，明明有行政字樣，遂倡改隷行政院之議，倘司法院不特設該部，而直接掌理該部權限內之事務，或雖特設該部，而名為法務部，不露行政字樣，則司法行政部必不致隷行政院矣。」此在普通人或不免有所觀念，然吾人以為倡議改隷者，必別有理由在，特其理由，吾人無由知之耳。此項原因，已無探索之必要，茲就其得失論之，司法行政部改隷於行政院後，司法院仍掌理一部份之司法行政，已如上述，司法行政最高官署，旣分而為二，司法行政即因之而不能統一，此其失策，約有五點：一曰：政令難免抵觸，有失政府之威信，舉例言之，依民事訴訟法第六十六條之規定，計算法定期間所應扣除之在途期間，由司法行政最高官署定之，赴地方法院或高等法院之在途期間，固應由行政院或司法行政部定之，赴最高法院之在途期間，（參照民事訴訟法第三四條第二項第二三三條第二項第四九六條第一項）仍應由司法院定之，蓋司法院為最高法院之司法行政最高官署赴最高法院之在途期間，非行政院或司法行政所得代定也，此徴之民事訴訟法第四百六十三條第二項所稱司法行政最高官署，向係解為指司法院而言，毫無疑義，設使行政院或司法行政部所定某地至首都高等法院之在途期間，與司法院所定該地主最高法院之在途期間不同，未免有失政府之威信。法院組織法第八十八條載：「依前條規定有監督權者對於被監督之人員關於職務上之事項得發命令使之注意，」設使關於同種事項，司法院院長對於最高法院推事所發之命令如此，而司法行政部部長對於高等法院推事所發之命令如彼，其為有失政府威信，亦不待言。二曰：最高法院與下級法院相互間處理事務，不易保持聯繫，以幸工作效率。蓋法院組織法第五十六條規定：「各級法院及分院與最高法院檢察署處務規和以命令定之，」定最高法院之處務規程，由司法院主其事，定下級法院之處務規程，由行政院或司法行政部主其事，最高法院與下級法院之處理事務，即不易保持聯繫，以幸工作效率。倘司法院院長與司法行政部部長於監督權之行使上，見解各有不同，則欲保持聯繫，尤感困難。三曰：同一事務由兩機關分別辦理，人力物力兩不經濟。例如三十四年關於民刑訴訟法之修正，與復員後辦理民刑訴訟補充條例，及台灣法院接收民刑案件處理條例之制定，司法院與司法行政部以各為主管事項，各向立法院提出草案，即其實例。四曰：一種事務由兩機關會同辦理，難期迅速，例如三十六年元旦所頒罪犯赦免減刑令，丁項規定：「減刑之詳細辦法，由司法院會同行政院定之」，此項辦法，未制定頒行前，所有刑事案件，應減刑者，均不能辦理，乃竟遲至二月十九日始制定公布者，以兩院往復磋商，頗費時日也。而行政院接司法院所定草案後，必令交司法行政部核議具復，俟復後再行核辦，尤為遲延之原因。假使司法行政不失統一，則此項辦法早已公布矣，其他因司法行政之不統一，必須會同辦理之事項，尚不乏其例。如律師法第一條第三項規定：「律師檢　辦法由考試院會同司法院行政院定之」是也。五曰：條件之審判，與司法官成績之考核，不能聯繫，最高法院為終審機關，曾經高等法院裁判之案件上訴於最高法院者居大多數，高等法院及地方法院推事辦案，是否妥速，最高法院之最　，若眞由最高法院於辦案時，遂一評定記錄，俾司法行政長官懲獎司法官有所依據，則於幸效率改良司法，必大有裨益。今因司法行政部隷屬於行政院致最高法院之審判案件與司法行政部之考核司法官成績，不能互相聯繫，未免可惜。由是觀之，司法行政分由行政司法兩院掌理，在立法論上洵非得策。</p>
<p>掌理機關的檢討</p>
<p>憲法第七十七條規定：「司法院為國家最高司法機關掌理民事刑事行政訴訟之審判及公務員之懲戒」，第七十八條之規定：「司法院解釋憲法並有統一解釋法律並命令之權」，固無司法行政由司法院掌理之明文，然在解釋上，司法行政當然全部由司法院掌理，其理由如左：</p>
<p>（一）憲法第六十三條規定：「立法院有議決法律案預算案戒嚴案大赦案宣戰案媾和案條約案及國家其他重要事項之權」，關於立法之行政固未嘗明定其有掌理之權，然立法院亦有種種行政事務，例如關於文書之收發及保管事項關於文件之分配撰擬編製事項，關於會議紀錄事項，關於職員之任免監督事項，關於典守印信事項，關於庶務事項，皆關於立法之行政也。此種行政事務，若不能由立法院掌理，則立法權勢將不克適當行使。又憲法第八十三條規定：「考試院為國家最高考試機關掌理考試任用銓敘考績等事項」，關於考試之行政，固未嘗明定其有掌理之權，然觀現行考試院組織法所列秘書處參事處職掌之事項，皆為關於考試之行政，且依現行銓敘處組織條例之規定銓敘部得於各省設銓敘處辦理各該省委任職公務員之銓敘事宜，關於銓敘處之設立及其職員之任免監督等事項，亦為關於考試之行使。憲法施行後，此種行政事務，必由考試院掌理，可斷言也。又憲法第九十條規定「監察院為國家最高監察機關行使同意彈劾糾舉及審計權」，關於監察之行政，如現行監察院組織法所列秘書處參事職　事項，關於各區監察使署之設立與其職員之任免監督等事項，固未嘗其有掌理之權，然在憲法施行後，亦必由監察院掌理無疑，是憲法規定五院之權限，不過舉其專有之主管事務耳。五院為使其權限內專有之主管事務，能適當處理而無窒碍，當然得掌理其牽聯之必要行政事務，不必以明文規定之，即在行政院亦有此種行政事務，故行政院所掌理之行政，分為兩種：第一種行政，如外交國防教育交通三類，為其專有之主管事務，此與立法司法考試監察相對立。第二種行政，如所屬職員之任免監督之類，為使其專有這主管事務能適當處理所必要之行政事務，此即關於行政之行政，（以其專有之主管事務，亦名行政，若簡稱行政，行政意義，恐欠明瞭）與立法行政司法行政考試行政監察行政相對立。憲法第五十三條所稱之行政，僅指第一種行政而言，其第二種行政，則應解為當然由行政院掌理，與立法行政司法行政考試行政監察行政均不包含在內。憲法之所以未如五五憲草第七十六條明定司法行政由司法院掌理者，蓋為使其立法體裁一貫起見，對於司法行政未便獨異，非認司法行政應由行政院掌理也。</p>
<p>（二）憲法第七十九條第一項規定：「司法院設院長副院長各一人，」而其第七十七條第七十八條所定由司法院掌理之事項，並不屬於院長副院長之職權，法院組織法第三條規定「地方法院審判案件以推事一人獨任行之，」「高等法院審判案件以推事三人分合議行之，」「最高法院審判案件以推事五人或三人之合議行之，」是民事刑事訴訟之審判，非司法院院長副院長之職權也，行政法院組織法第五條第一項規定：「行政法院之審判。以評事五人合議行之，」是行政訴訟之審判，非司法院院長之職權也，公務員懲戒委員會組織法第七條規定：「公務員懲戒委員會懲戒事件之審議，應有委員五人以上之出席，」是公務員之懲戒，非司法院院長副院長之職權也，憲法第七十九條第二項規定：「司法院設大法官若干人掌理本憲法第七十八條規定事項，」是解釋憲法並統一解釋法令非司法院院長副院長之職權也，且憲法第八十條規定：「法官須走出黨派以外依據法律獨立審判不受任何干涉，」則司法院院長非但無審判之職權，且不得干涉法官之獨立審判，然則司法院設此院長副院長果何為哉？憲法明文所定司法院院長之事務，不外兩點：第四十四條規定總統對於院與院間之爭執，除本憲法有規定者外，得召集有關各院院長會商解決之。」第一百十五條規定：「省自治法施行中如因其中某條發生重大障碍，經司法院召集有關方面陳述意見後，由行政院院長立法院院長考試院院長與監察院院長組織委員會以司法院院長為主席提出方案解決之，」司法院院長之設，殆為此乎！然此非經常應有之事務，如司法院不設院長，此種事務可使首席大法官為之，何必為此特於司法院設一院長？司法院院長之設，必有其經常之職務存焉。司法院組織法草案第三條，雖規定「司法院大法官會議以大法官十一人組織之院長副院長為當然大法官包括在前項名額之內大法官會議以院長為主席行使解釋憲法並統一解釋法律命令之職權，」然此與憲法之本旨是否相符，不無疑義，憲法之本旨果係若此，則必依立法院院長副院長由立法委員互選，監察院院長副院長由監察委員互選之例，（參照憲法第六六條第九二條）規定為司法院，設院長副院長各一人，由總統於大法官中任命之，何以於規定該院長副院長之外，另行規定，設大法官若干人，且同草案第十一條規定：「院長副院長之任期為六年，」固未可厚非，惟憲法第八十一條規定：「法官為終身職，」院長副院長旣應定有任期，而又規定其為當然大法官，尤未免與之衹觸，是則憲法規定司法院設院長副院長各一人，其經當職務必為綜理司法行政，而非使其為當然大法官也明矣。</p>
<p>（三）二十年六月十五日公布之修正國民政府組織法第三十七條規定：「司法院為國民政府最高司法機關掌理司法審判之職權」，並未定明司法行政由何院掌理，此與憲法第七十七條之規定文字，雖不盡同，實質則無差異，而在二十年十二月三十日修正之國民政府組織法公布前，司法行政部仍隷屬於司法院，不因其未明定司法行政，由司法院掌理而受影響，是憲法第七十七條關於司法院審判權之規定，無碍於司法院院長之掌理，全部司法行政已有行使可考。又法院組織法第一條規定：「法院審判民事刑事訴訟條件並依法律所定管轄非訟事件，」其所謂依法律管轄非訟事件，並不包含司法行政在內，觀於司法第十條之規定非論事件，僅由地方法院管轄，即可明瞭。審判民事刑事訴訟案件及管轄非訟事件，屬於推事之專權，並非法院院長之權限，而同法第十一條第十八條第二十三條規定各級法院，各置院長一人，綜理全院行政事務，與其第一條之規定並行不悖，蓋法院為使其審判權能適當行使而無窒碍，當然得掌理其牽聯之必要行政事務，無待於第一條特設明文也。憲法第七十七條與第七十九條第一項之關係，實與法院組織法第一條與第十一第十八第二十三各條之關係無異，不得以憲法第七十七條規定審判權之屬於司法院，遂謂司法院院長無掌理司法行政之權。</p>
<p>（四）最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會，因為審判機關，然法院組織法第二十三條規定：「最高法院置院長一人特任經理全院行政事務，」行政法院組織法第二條規定：「行政法院置院長一人綜理全院行政事務，」公務員懇戒委員會組織法第八條第一項規定：「公務員懲戒委員會委員長綜理會務，監督所屬職員，對於懲戒事件得查察進行程序，但不得干涉懲戒，」是最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會，皆有關於審判之行政事務，此項行政事務，即司法行政由院長或委員長掌理之，而最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會為司法院所屬機關，其行政事務受司法院院長之監督，內有若干行政事務，如薦任以上職員之任免，並須呈請司法院院長行之，雖在司法行政部隷屬於行政院之時期，亦莫不然，且司法院組織法草案第四條規定「司法院置左列各機關（一）最高法院，（二）行政法院，（三）公務員懲戒委員會，」第十條第一項規定：「院長綜理院務及監督所屬機關之行政事務，」則在憲法施行後，亦擬如是矣，然則採用司法行政應由行政院掌理之說者，不過將關於高等法院地方法院之司法行政劃歸行政院掌理而已，所有關於最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會之司法行政，仍不能不使司法院掌理。夫最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會之隷屬於司法院，與高等法院地方法院之隷屬於司法行政部，性質上毫無差異，旣以司法行政之性質為行政之故，使高等法院地方法院隷屬於行政院之司法行政部，則非使最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會一併隷屬於行政院，其說不能貫澈，不僅此也，大法官之角憲法，並行使統一解釋法律命令之權，雖為司法權之行使，然大法官辦公房屋之修理，大法官薪俸之發給，請求解釋文件之收受分配保管，解答文件之用印繕發，皆屬司法行政事務，則大法官亦必使之隷屬於行政院，然後司法行政應由行政院掌理之說，乃能貫澈，今僅使高等法院地方法院隷屬於行政之司法行政部，則不過就司法院不應掌理之司法行政減少其數量並將司法院不應掌理之司法行政，悉數劃歸行政院。如是而由吾說已貫澈矣，與以五十步笑百步，何以異哉？司法行政全部劃歸行政院掌理，旣為勢所不能，則關於高等法院地方法院之司法行政，仍由司法院掌理，何獨不可？或曰：「高等法院地方法院為各省市縣之司法機關，與最高法院之純為中央司法機關者不同，」殊不知司法制度由中央立法並執行之，為憲法第一百零七條第四款之所明定；則高等法院地方法院雖設於各省市縣，而其為中央司法機關，實與最高法院毫無差異，況依現行制度，公務員懲戒機關原有中央公務員懲戒委員會與地方公務員懲戒委員會之分，其事務監督以及用人行政諸端，均由司法院直接處理，徴以各省銓敘處審計分處監察使署，亦均由最高主官之考試監察兩院分別監督，則各省市縣之高等法院地方法院，應由司法院統轄，亦未容獨異。</p>
<p>（五）依憲法第七十七條之規定民事刑事訴訟之審判，除現役軍人得使之受軍事審判，在憲法第九條設有特別規定外，由司法院掌理，司法院如不能直接掌理，則必其掌理機關為司法院之組織分子而後可，各級法院皆為司法院之組織分子，觀於憲法第八十二條規定：「各級法院這組織以法律定之，」其條文列於第七章司法之內，而不列於第五章行政之內，毫無疑義，若高等法院及地方法院為隷屬於行政院之司法部所設，（聞行政院組織法草案規定行政院設司法部，）縱其名稱亦為法院，仍係行政院之組織分子，而非司法院之組織分子，查司法院組織法草案第四條規定：「司法院置左列各機關：（一）最高法院，（二）行政法院，（三）公務員懲戒委員會，」並未規定司法院於各省市設高等法院，於各縣市設地方法院，則高等法院及地方法院非司法院所設，即非司法院之組織分子可知矣，旣非司法院所設，則侮隷屬於行政院之司法部所設，而為行政院之組織分子亦明矣。夫以行政院之組織分子，掌理民事刑事訴訟這審判，寧得謂非違憲？雖當事人對於高等法院之判決或裁定，得上訴或搞吿於最高法院，亦不過與不服行政官署這再訴願決定向司法院所設之行政法院提起行政訴訟無異，為再訴願決定之行政官署旣不因此而失其為行政院組織分子之性質，則高等法院亦何得因此認為司法院這組織分子？或曰：「外國之法院大都為隷屬於內閣這司法部所設，何以不為違憲，」不知外國之憲法，大都規定法院掌理民事刑事訴訟之審判，其法院由隷屬於內閣之司法部設之，又大都為其憲法之所許，我國憲法第七十七條規定：「司法院掌理民事刑事訴訟這審判，則非司法院之組織分子，不能有此權限，」彼此憲法之規定，廻不相同，何得以彼律此？或曰：「憲法旣明定司法院為國家最高司法機關，自僅須掌理最高級審判之最高法院為其組織分子，其掌理下級審判之高等法院地方法院不在其內，」是又不然。所謂最高乃無上之意，非必排除下級也，果如其說，則憲法明定行政院為最高行政機關，何以反對論者不使之掌理最高法院之司法行政，而僅使之掌理下級法院之司法行政？且以下級法院為行政院之組織分子，使之掌理民事刑事訴訟之審判，在憲法上究有何根據？此說之不能，奚待煩言。審判民事刑事訴訟之各級法院，旣須為司法院之組織分子，則司法院組織法草案第四條必改為：「司法院置左列各機關：（一）最高法院，各省市高等法院及各縣市地方法院，（二）行政法院，（三）中央公務員懲戒委員會及各省市地方公務員懲戒委員會」，始與憲法第七十七條第八十二條之本旨相符，司法院組織法之規定旣應如此，則關於高等法院地方法院之司法行政，應由司法院掌理，不待言矣。</p>
<p>對兩種論據反駁</p>
<p>以上為憲法上應解為司法行政全部由司法院掌理之理由。茲再將反對論者所持兩種論據，論駁如左：</p>
<p>一謂「外國之司法部皆隷屬於內閣，我國行政院與外國之內閣相當，司法部或司法行政部自應隷屬於行政院」，按美國聯邦司法部只能監督檢察官，對於法院之推事並無任免監督之權限，與大陸法系國家之司法部總攬全國司法行政者，逈不相同，大陸法系之司法部，雖隷屬於內閣，然其司法部部長對於最高級法院之司法行政亦有掌理之權，以與最高級法院同級之司法部監督最高級法院，其失當固不待論，其所以若此者，一百欲使司法行政不失統一，一面又不於最高級法院之上設一與內閣總理同等地位之司法長官，遂使兩個同級機關立於監督與被監督之地位，我國旣行五院制度，於最高級法院之上，設有與行政院院長同等地位之司法院長，一切司法行政即應槪由司法院院長掌理，若採大陸法系之制度，則不惟關於高等法院地方法院之司法行政，應由行政院之司法部掌理，即關於最高法院行政法院及公務員懲戒委員會之司法行政，亦必一併由行政院掌理，而司法院將無存在之餘地矣，茍不能不設司法院使之掌理，關於最高法院之司法行政，則關於高等法院地方法院之司法行政，何必劃歸行政院設部掌理，使司法行政失其統一，此種論據，殊與五院制度之精神不符，顯非可採。</p>
<p>二謂「五五憲草第七十六條明定：「司法院掌理司法行政」，其後政治協商會議議決憲草修改原則，其第四項載：「司法院即為國家最高法院，不兼管司法行政，由大法官若干人組織之」，等語，故提出於國民大會之憲草第八十二條規定：「司法院為國家最高審判機關掌理民事刑事行政訴訟之審判及憲法之解釋」，並無掌理司法行政字樣，憲法第七十七條亦無此種字樣，由立法之經過觀之，司法院實無掌理司法行政之權」，按解釋法律之目的，係在探究者之意思，抑在闡明法律本身之意義，從前固有爭論，近世這學者槪採後之見解，故如法律之草案起草之經過及草案變遷之原因，不能拘束解釋者，法律之意義應就作為法律而發表者，以學理闡明之，憲法之意義，係認司法院有掌理司法行政之權，已依上開種種理由闡明之矣。憲法之所以未如五五憲草明定司法行政由司法院掌理者，係為使其立法體裁一貫起見，對於司法行政未便獨異，非認司法行政應由行政院掌理，亦已於理由第一點說明，至政治協商會議議決之憲草修改原則第四項所載司法院即為國家最高法院，不兼管司法行政各語，憲法內並未作為法律而發表之，本不能據以解釋憲法，即使司法院直接掌理最高級之審判，不另設最高法院，亦有關於最高級審判之行政事務，茍非使司法院隷屬於行政院，此種司法行政仍應使之掌理，此種司法行政旣應使之掌理關於下級審判之司法行政，何獨不應使之掌理？此項論據，亦無理由</p>
<p>結語　由上種種論之，關於審判部分之司法行政，在憲法之解釋上，自應全部由司法院掌理，絕無將其關於下級法院之部份劃歸行政院掌理之理由，倘行政司法兩院組織法草案關於此點之規定，竟獲通過，則與憲法不無抵觸，立法院制定法律，向係審愼從事，當不致輕易通過也。</p>

<h3>今日之危機</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>The　Crisis　of　Our　Age，by　Sorokin</p>
<p>本書是當代社會學權威速樂鏗近著，在美國出版後三年內曾發行八版，足見其影響之大。以前他著有「當代社會學說」，「社會變動論」，及「社會與文化之動力」三大作品，歷任國際社會學會主席及哈佛大學社會學系主任。他雖是俄國人却不贊成蘇聯的社會主義。此公學問淵博精通，古今中外博覽無遺。本書是他前幾部鉅製的精華。本文可說是介紹這個精華之精華。</p>
<p>他的主題在他的「社會與文化之動力一一書已有明確的說明，他說：</p>
<p>一今日西方社會之生活，組織，文化，無論在任何重要的方面都已面臨非常的危機。它的身體與心靈均有顯著的病態。……我們似乎處於兩個時代的中間：一個是有光輝的過去而今將死的感覺文化；另一個是將來的，富有創造性的觀念文化。感覺文化已經有了六百多年的光榮榮歷史，於今已成尾聲，我們現在便正是生活在這個近乎尾聲的感覺文化的時代，當然我們的思想和行動也還受着這個時代的影響。這個將近死去的時代至今雖仍有其過去的光輝，但已至迴光返照的境况。它的暗影正在逐漸的籠罩着我們，使我們徬徨無措，不知如何適應這黃昏時的昏暗。這個過度時期的黑夜將蒞臨到我們面前，我們將遭遇到黑暗的恐怖。但走過了這段黑暗的路程我們就會見到一個偉大的新文化的曙光，這個偉大的新文化便是觀念的文化，它會迎接着未來的人們。」今日世界的危機，有一般人看得太簡易了，認為和歷史上人類所遭遇的許多危機一樣，祗不過是人類在經濟財政軍事政治上所遭遇的許多困難而已。所以他們以為祗要人類能够增進國際關係，改善經濟制度，變更政治情况，這個危機就可迎刃而解了。還有一種人如Spengler（西方之歿落的作者）却又以為西方文化已到了死亡的階段，整個是不可藥救。本書作者以為這兩種看怯都是錯誤的。今日世界的危機並不祗是枝枝節節的政治經濟問題，而是在整個做人和思想的方面出了毛病，它是整個文化的腐蝕。但舊文化的腐蝕並非這個文化的全部毀滅而是蛻變出一個新的文化。</p>
<p>作者把人類文化的發展視為三個過程的輸迴循環：（一）觀念文化階段，它是出世的，超脫的，神聖的，它是以心靈奴役形體的，以精神價値支配物質享受的；（二）理想文化階段，這是一個過渡時期的文化，它是半聖半凡，亦心亦物的；（三）感覺文化階段，它是現世的，凡俗的，功利的，它是崇尙肉體上的享受，以心為形役的。例如希臘在紀元前九世紀到六世紀是觀念文化，希臘羅馬自紀元前四世紀到紀元後第四世紀便是感覺文化；中世紀是觀念文化而近六百年又是感覺文化。在這兩種文化轉變之問的過渡時期便是所謂理想文化，這個階段時期很短，作者以為現在西方的文化乃是感覺文化的歿落，今日的危機乃是西方感覺文化的歿落。這個感覺文化的歿落將使西方文化經過一個短期的理想文化的階段，然後再產生一個新的觀念文化‘</p>
<p>作者在本書中從西方的美術，科學，哲學，宗敎，倫理，怯律各方面的發展歷史上證明他的學說。他覺得今日西方社會在上述各方面都已逐漸走到感覺文化的僵化和腐化的階段。在這個階段的西方社會發生了許多的病態。第一，犯罪行為的增加和懲罰方去的　　；第二，精神病的流傳和自殺數量的驚人；第三，大規模戰爭的殘殺和以流血來奪取政權的革命；再加上第四，經濟破壞，和生活脅迫。</p>
<p>現代感覺文化已面臨瓦解的時機，宅在最近的文化動態中呈現出四稱現象：（一）不調協約內在矛盾，例如一方面是喊着人類平等，另一方面却表現出在知識，道德，經濟，政治上的極端的不平等；再如一方面是要想追求最大多數人的最大快樂，另一方面却在替人類製造空前未有的浩刦。（二）五花八門，混雜一團而不成其為一個統一文化，在今日的西方肚會中我們可以看見人們同時在事受印度烟，土耳其浴，中圍茶，信仰東方的宗敎哲學，形成了一個雜亂的萬花筒。（三）只求量的　大，而不顧質的高尙，祗求外表的眩耀，而不顧內在的價値。例如舞台的表演是成知成百的伶人和樂師的大集合；學校裏只滿坑滿谷的生員工役；書的好壞是依賴於銷售的數量；學者的優劣是取決於聽衆的多寨。（四）創造性的蔽錮，在近代的各種作品中已逐漸看不出人們的創造能力，十九世紀的作曲家如Ｗagner　，Tschaikowsky，以至Dubussy，在二十世紀一個也沒有看見；十九世紀的文學家如Tolstoi　　Dostoevski,Byron，Goethe，Balzac在二十世紀也沒有見過一個影子；其他在劇本，繪畫，雕刻等方面也莫不如此。至多在機械工程方面尙多貢獻，但即是道一方面也頗有衰落之象。</p>
<p>未來文化的趨勢是傾向於觀念型態，現在的文化並不毀滅而只是用以違到神聖的目的，目前的過渡時期是不能免的，只是我們要减少宅給人們的痛苦，使這個時期很快的過去。他說：「人不只是一個有機體，他還是「絕對價値』的傳遞者。……文化的最大使命，無論在科學，技術，宗敎，哲學，倫理，藝術，任何一方面都祗是這個『絕對價値』在經騐世界中的反映和實現。」</p>
<h3>讀「幸福之路」</h3>
<p>— 范之龍</p>
<p>英國羅素作　傳雷譯　南國版</p>
<p>這是一本充滿了溫情和智慧的好書，作者首先就吿訴我們，這部書不是獻給博學之士的，也不是給那般把實際問題作為助談的人，旣無高深的哲理，也無淵博的徵引。而只把通情達理的一些意見歸納起來。其所採取的學說都是由作者自己的經騐和觀察證實過的，而且每次尊從這些學說時，都會增加了自己的幸福。在現在這種苦悶動盪的環境中，無人不渴望幸福的到來。而幸福旣非遺產，更不是天賦，幸福是需要人為的爭取。所以這本書本名呌「幸福之征服」（Conquest　　of　happiness）。是呌人怎樣去爭取幸福的。</p>
<p>在這本書中，確給許多感受着憂鬰之苦的男女很多帮助，憑着適當的努力，幸福是可以獲得的。當然不幸福是有着種種原因，在外的是物質環境和現存的制度，那不能僅靠了個人的努力，而在內的原因則是心理的癥結，傳統的信念，這都是個人能力之內，而往往為個人所不知，或竟不願糾正的。那些自私，猜忌，煩慮，自我耽溺的感覺是可以克服的。作者一一道出我們的病症，他吿訴我們不幸福的原故是因，自我沈耽，浪漫底克的憂鬰，競爭，煩悶與興奮，疲勞，嫉妒，犯罪意識，被虐在，畏懼輿論</p>
<p>「自我沈溺」的人，無時無地不把「自我」裝在腦中，以自我的利害去衡量，友誼，娛樂，和工作。他們頭腦中只有一個「自我」，把整個的世界看作建造一個人自我的顯赫的素材，犧牲了人性中一切的分子來培植一個分子，而培育其虛榮心到了高度時，除了自己以外，對任何人都不感興趣。結果形成了畏罪在，自溺在，自大在典型的病態心理。</p>
<p>所謂浪漫底克的憂鬰，却習尙一種「不歡」的驕傲，好像他們的智慧都看破了前一代的熟誠，覺得世界上再沒有甚麼東西値得生活，覺得萬般空虛，太陽底下無新事，而人永遠勞作，物永遠動盪，可沒有一件東西常住。這種才子式的憂鬰實由於太多的空閑。</p>
<p>「競爭」，一般人辛苦的競爭並非必要的生活的鬬爭，實際是成功的鬬爭，他們所懼怕並非沒有早飯吃，而是恐怕自己不能耀武揚威蓋過鄰人。當問他們的工作對公衆能有甚麼貢獻的時候，他們一無所答。而其心理狀態恰如百碼競走者相同，但其終點是墳墓。其實「成功」只能為造成幸福的一分子，倘犧牲了一切其餘的分子去贏取這一分子，代價就太高了。成功的現實勢必令人捱受煩悶的煎熬，除非先懂得怎樣去處置成功。</p>
<p>「煩悶與興奮」也是不快活的心理。所謂「煩悶」就是眼前擺着現狀，想像裏又盤旋着另外一些更愉快的情狀。所以煩悶在本質上是渴望着發生事故，所渴望的不一定是愉快的事情。煩悶的反面不是歡樂而是興奮，我們在社會階梯上越往上爬，刺激的追求也愈形劇烈，結果凡有能力追遂的人，永遠席不暇暖的到處奔波着，而形成了煩悶與興奮的循環，永無快樂，眞正的快樂是安靜中的快樂，他們的喜樂也不是別人心目中認為興奮的那一種。一切偉大的成就必須歷久不懈的工作，不是興奮追求。</p>
<p>再講到「疲勞」，一種精神上的疲憊。這種疲勞多半是由煩盧而來的。生活在這緊張的社會，神精難得鬆弛，不斷的要接觸生人，就不斷的緊張，神精支離破裂，陷入疲勞之中。這種人是髣髦在一個人與外界之問掛了一重簾幕，他感到印象是糢糊的，聲音是微弱的，他無力再注意四周的人物。對於飲食陽光毫無樂趣，只是念念不忘地想着一些問題，只更會日益疲勞，無法休息</p>
<p>在不快活的許多主要原因中除去煩惱當首推嫉妒。嫉妒是一種惡習，一部份屬於精神的。它主要是從來不從事情本身上看事情，而在它們的關係上着眼。懷着妒意去注視外界，是一定不會快活的，他知道有些比自己更優美的東西在他手旁，却不知道究竟在那裏，怎樣去尋找。絕望之下，嫉妒佔據了他，悲哀憤懣進入了他的靈魂。而適當的救治之道是培養精神紀律，擴張心胸，並必須會超越自我。由超越自我而自由自在，像宇宙一樣的無掛無碍。</p>
<p>有着犯罪意識的人，總離不開犯罪的感覺，覺得自己不配列入上品。這實不能作一種向上的召換，而要當作一種病態。我們的傳統道德素來是太過以自己為中心的罪惡的觀念，而這便是不智的「自我中心」底一部。作者認為應該排除迷信的道德，而犯罪感是應接受合理的倫理觀所指示的。犯罪意識非但不能促成良好的生活，反令獲得相反的結果，它令人不快樂，令人自慚形穢。他對優越的人心懷怒恨。他將發覺嫉妒很容易，佩服很困難，他將變成一般地不受歡迎，越來越孤獨，永不會有幸福感。</p>
<p>至於「被虐狂」；極度的被虐狂是瘋癲的一種，是種很嚴重的病痼。普通顯示於生活上的則是時時感到受人迫害，實際上，是因爲缺乏同情心的緣故，很易使其證實自己受大衆的厭惡。或則是太看高自己。我是根本遠反了對方的意志而施惠於人。我們對自己總抱着溫柔的愛和深切的敬意，我們期望人家對我們也是如此。我們從未想到，我們不能期待人家的看待我們，勝於我們看待人家。</p>
<p>最後一章是「畏懼輿論」：一般而論，除了專家之外，大家對別人的意見總是過於重視。就可能被役於社會的輿論，而感到苦惱。實則眞正漠視與論是一種力量，一個社會中，充滿不向世俗低頭的男女，定比大家行事千篇一律的社會有意思的多。在每個人的性格個別發展的地方，就有不同的典型。人當然不應當有意行動怪僻，和那守舊拘泥的人同樣無聊。人應當自然。應當在不是根本反社會範圍之內，尊重天生的趣味。</p>
<p>以上幾章，都是消極的向心理的癥結進攻，把一個人由自我禁錮的牢籠中解放出來。在下面幾章，作者又吿訴我們如何積極的打開心靈的道路，去尋求快樂。怎樣通過了興趣，情愛，家庭，工作，閒情，努力和捨棄，成一個個幸福的人。他寫下幸福的秘訣是讓你的興趣盡量擴大，讓你對人物的反應盡量傾向於友善。</p>
<p>羅素的這本書，充滿了溫厚的人情，沒有說敎，也並不呌人逃避現實。相反卻是教人面對現實，解放了自己。在這偉大的生命之流中，獻出自己的愛。他與人們共同感受，共同呼吸。這樣的入是覺得自己是宇宙的公民，自由享受世界所提供的色相和歡樂。不因死亡而困惑，因爲他覺得並不眞和後來人分離。如是深切的和生命的長流溶合之下，至高至大的歡樂才能覓得。</p>
<p>傳雷先生的譯筆，信實流俐，一字不苟，頗値稱許。而封面設計的樸美，使人覺得這本書的本身就是幸福。</p>

<h3>「學習與戰鬥」</h3>
<p>— 王任叔著一上海雜誌公司版</p>
<p>當前的靑年中，由於民族自衛戰學的啟示，使他們明白了學習理論的重要性，他們　喝似地追求着學術知識。但這條荊棘叢生的學習道路上二又往往使他們受到不少障礙－不理解學習的方法。</p>
<p>這個現象可以說是普遍地留存在廣大的學習靑年底內心。這種痛苦的覊絆，對於學習，是深深地受到它的打擊的！</p>
<p>可是，靑年們不必因此氣沮氣餒，指示我們學習道路書，解除我們苦痛的書，是會出現在書店裏的。</p>
<p>現在我就在此介紹一本給諸位。</p>
<p>這本「學習與戰鬥」，無疑地，是指示剛入門靑年的學習門徑！作者文筆淺顯通俗，祗要中學程度，即可瞭解其內容。因此，無論是在校的，或是職業的靑年，拿這本書作為初步學習的指導，是都很適宜的。</p>
<p>綜合本本的內容，簡括的說，是這　的：</p>

<h3>「美國憲法史」讀後</h3>
<p>— 趙師傳</p>
<p>"A　Constitutional　History　of　the　United　States"By　Andrew　C.　Mclaughlin</p>
<p>留心美國憲法的人都知道美國憲法之基本原則是三權分立的，即國會行使立怯權，總統行使行政權，最高法院行使司法權。三權不但彼此分立，實際上並互相牽制，即所謂制衡（Check　and　balance）的原則。不過年來國內學者論總統制者往往只强調美國總統之受國會牽制，而對國會與司怯的關係略而不談；有之，則把最高怯院的地位大貶，因為最高怯院的大怯官須由國會的上議院批准，並且國會可以彈劾審判的方式使其去職。這種見解，很難使我們瞭解立法與司法間之眞正關係；這關係不淸楚，則難以明瞭制衡的整個意義。最近讀了這本「美國憲法史」，很想節略地以書中所得談談美國國最高法院與國會的關係，及其在憲法發展史上的地位。</p>
<p>照憲法規定，總統得經上議院之同意任命最高法院的法官。這一點我們只能認為是國會牽制總統，而不是牽制最高法院。又照憲怯規定，法官（他們是Civil　offcers）如犯有叛國及受賄等罪可被彈劾去職。這裏我們要注意的是：下議院雖可提出彈劾，而審判此彈劾案者，獨上議院有權。至於去職與吾，則須由上議院出席人數三分之二的表決。憲怯上雖規定如此，實際上彈劾案在美國憲法史上並不多見。彈劾法官的案子只有兩件：第一件是彈劾John　Pickering（afereral　　distriet　judge　inNewHampshire），但他並非最高法院的怯官，而且據他兒子的聲訴，他實息有神經病，所以他雖被去戰，並不値重視。比較嚴重的，是彈劾最高法院法官Samuel　Chase；但上議院審判的結果，判為無罪。所以最高法院的法官在美國憲法史上尙無一人被彈劾去職。若我們以國會具有彈劾審判權而便忽視最高怯院的地位，那是很不當的，</p>
<p>反過來說，最高怯院却能牽制國會，因為它可以審查（Review）國會所通過的法案是吾合乎憲法。此權憲法雖未明文規定，但最高法院院長的翰馬紹爾（John　Marshall）在Marbury　　V．Madison一案中（一八〇三年）已奠定運用此權之基礎。在本案中，馬紹爾宣佈國會所通過的Judiciary　Act（一七八九）中的一部分為無效，因為該部分授權最高法院頒發命令狀（Writ　of　mandamus），而憲法並未授此權與最高法院，故該部分不合憲法。</p>
<p>最高法院之具有此權，是非常重要之事，因為它可限制國會的立法必須在憲法範圍之內，使國會不能為所欲為。唐尼（Taney）做最高法院院長時曾宣佈Missouri　Compromise為無效。以前羅斯福總統「新政」中的法案有的也被最高法院認為無效。所以國會雖能牽制總統，總統雖能任命法官（法官經任命後，終身任職，總統無權撤換），而國會却受最高法院的牽制。我們如認淸此三者的相互關係，則制衡的意義自易明了。</p>
<p>最高法院不但牽制了國會的立法，它在憲怯發展史上也佔了最重要的地位。特別在初期馬紹爾任院長時（自一八〇一年至一八三五年），最高怯院的聲望及勢力大極了。那時聯邦政府成立不久，一切對於憲法的解釋尙無例可援，所以馬紹爾的意思就可說是憲法的意思。所幸馬紹爾是一偉大的法官，他雖也有偏見，但他眼光遠大，他的判決差不多都成為解釋憲法的天經地義，對國家的發展及對聯邦政府權力的穩定，皆有莫大的貢獻。</p>
<p>我們自然不能否認美國立法與行政兩權之大，但我們也不應把司法權看低。至少在憲怯發展史上說，美國最高法院喲影響及貢獻遠非國會和總統所可比擬約。</p>

<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 五聰</p>
<p>我嘗和朋友馬說：</p>
<p>「孔夫子誠然有他的偉大處，然而依照我尊敬的說法講，他是人，會吃飯，也會放屁。」</p>
<p>然而，令我廳怪的事真是多着。許多所謂「什麽家」之流的人物，常常愛發生許多高論。</p>
<p>「高爾基的鼻子扁得偉大，魯迅的面孔浮　得不朽。托爾斯太全靠他的大鬃　，還有留伯納也不是有大　　麽？還有郭沫若因為　所以……因為……所以……</p>
<p>於是「什麽家」們照普式金或莎士比亞的樣子打一個大領結，學高爾基皺眉毛，學尼采鼓眼請。學……到照像館去拍他一織十寸放大照，於長自我欣賞一香。外加互相稱譽，新的莎翁或普式金還吿產生。</p>
<p>我最恨抹煞；沙裏有金，金並不因為產自沙裏而不成為金。</p>
<p>同樣，替偉人神話缺點，亦為不智的行為。</p>
<p>事實上有一種怪趨向。人之有善行，及其在某一方面的能力無可　議底，不獨不承認他所有的少數弱點，而特別加以文飾。這眞是太不聰明的做怯了。因為你的文飾一且被人發覺，你的榮響也同時不幸地被抹煞。</p>
<p>我曾目擊許多善戰的將軍，喜歡耐　　雅，自命以書法文學可以名世。結果倒權的是宣紙搬墨，幸運的是那些偽造古　的商人。</p>
<p>織前中華書局印的「古今圖書集成」和商務印的「萬有文庫」，據說生宜很好。因為有許多大人物和商人可以將他作為文房擺設。</p>
<p>寄語文化商，有許多大部頭的書，書內不必印字，只要書殼上有名就行，旣省排工，又省油墨，如果存書賣不掉，還可改作小孩子的拍紙簿。</p>
<p>其實，更簡潔一點的話，文化商人們大可做幾個刻有「古今圖書集成」或「大英百科全害」的書箱子發售。旣可作風雅的擺設，又可作衣箱用。我想　笨生意是可以做得的。</p>
<p>希勒在他底劇作一陰謀與愛情」裏，借米納威爾的嘴說：「偉大的犯罪者，自已失身於汚濁的社會中，還時常用求愛的眼淚以救援那些無辜的人們！」</p>
<p>多少偉大的人啊！曾瞪着眼走進監獄，可是忍不住眼淚的傾流，看許多善良的靑年走近他們的身邊，日見顯頭。</p>
<p>傳敎士說。基督替代可憐的人們受罪，釘上了光榮的十字架。基督要、求獲得的僅只是愚昧的信仰。我未嘗懷疑基督的偉大，然而，我却惦念着可憐的人們是否可能得到拯救。</p>

<h3>咖啡座上客</h3>
<p>— 寅伯</p>
<p>說咖啡館是專供人們呷咖啡的去處，其實是並不盡然的。</p>
<p>不論是國際三樓或十四十八樓，霞飛路的弟弟斯，復興或卡夫卡司，乃至外灘的沙遜與匯中，就所有的座上客而言，很少是眞正悠閒地在那裏名符其實的「呷咖啡」，他們大抵都是「有所為」而來的！</p>
<p>如果你有這麼半天閒功夫，你不妨到幾個著名的咖啡館裏去巡禮一番，那才够你瞧呢。</p>
<p>這裏，首先是那些一本經談生意的朋友，所謂生意，當然是指廣義的而言，它包括實貨賣買，也包括空頭掮客，甚至假咖啡館作為「開調斧」「講斤頭」的臨時租借地的，於是有的眉飛色舞，唾沫四濺；有的垂頭喪氣，一籌莫展。他們大抵都是高談闊論，即使四座的人們都投以驚異乃至討厭的目光，他們還是津津樂道，旁若無人的。</p>
<p>以次多數計算，那末便是以咖啡館作為臨時歇脚地的人了，他們視咖啡館猶如旅途中的一個驛站，其作用頗有類於鄉間兩個村落之間的十里亭，他們或則分別來自不同的處所，或則同自某個地方出來並且還打算同到某一個更遠的處所去，於是就在這個驛站上，他們展開了下一個旅程的計劃與憧憬，這批人，他們來旣匆匆，去也匆匆，悠閒兩字也是無從談起的。</p>
<p>此外便是借咖啡館為談情說愛的「人間天堂」的情侶們了。當然他們與她們之間也有程度上差別，從「相親」或介紹認識起，到做朋友，初交際以迄山誓海盟地談情說愛為止，眞是形形色色，莫不俱全，至於那些非耳　撕磨不足以過癮曠男怨女，感謝天，也自有設計週到的老闆為他們佈置了隔離的座位，福煦路上的葉子咖啡館等便是以此作為號召的。</p>
<p>另一稱人以專坐（他們稱「孵」）咖啡館過日子，像是上公事房一樣，每年每月，無分　雨，他們都準時而到，三四或五六個蟠踞一桌，擺開龍門陣，上至天文，下至地理，旣談政治，也談女人，誰說他們是在「消閒」那才可笑，在他們自己，這是再嚴肅也沒有的公事呢。</p>
<p>比較佔少數的是那些在咖啡館裏看書報聽音樂的，像我這樣以咖啡桌權充寫字台來寫稿的人，那當然更少了。但無論如何，終究都是「有所為一而來的，所以我終認為：</p>
<p>說咖啡館是專供人們哩咖啡的去處，其實是並不盡然的。</p>
<h3>「老頭兒」</h3>
<p>— 阿露</p>
<p>中國歷史上的皇帝眞是無不以萬民為芻狗的－明人筆記「剪勝野聞」中有一則朱洪武軼事，洪武出身微賤，理該多少懂得一些「人民的感情」。可是並不，這裏有例：</p>
<p>「太祖嘗微行京城中，聞一老媼，密呼上為老頭兒；帝大怒。至徐太傳家，繞室而行，沉吟不已，時太傳他往，夫人震駭，恐有他虞；惶恐再拜，「得非妄夫徐達負罪於陛下耶？」太祖曰『非也，嫂無以為念，」亟傳令召五城兵馬司總諸軍至曰：「張士誠小竊江東，吳民至今呼為張王，今朕為天子，此邦居民，呼朕為老頭兒何也？」即命藉沒民家甚衆。』</p>
<p>因為「朕為天子」，人民便應該爭呼「萬歲」，中國的統治階級就是存着這樣的觀念，『老媚」大槪並非「出身名門」，所以不懂得這些大法，害得太傅徐達的太太誠惶誠恐，為什麽這老媼竟敢呼「皇帝」為「老頭兒」呢？太祖問：「何也？」划並不等誰解答，便「即」藉沒民家，這又顯見那些「五城兵馬司總之流的官兒都是「震駭」異常的</p>
<h3>「金石盟」</h3>
<p>— 流水</p>
<p>「金石盟」導演的風格是淸麗的，它正如那男主角留速於童戀時期中那一彎的湖心一樣，在凄凉中蘊藉着多少溫馨的意味。</p>
<p>幾個主要角色的抓取，那個心理治療的年靑的醫生；那個絕處逢生的浪蕩子；都有了深刻的造象。導演山姆伍德在人情味的轉捩點上，對人物感情，周圍的氣氛，表現得都極精湛動人。你看：、那心理治療的年靑的醫生，去對幼年的同伴，（現在是一個牀上殘廢）宣布他腿部被割的經過，這個高潮處理得多麼優越，那一段詩，背誦得多麽好，病室中三個角色激動的情形，使人無法遏制。</p>
<p>但「金石盟」劇本編製的成功，更帮助了全劇演出的完整。那些悲劇氣氛的貫穿，直到最後高潮，却使一個殘廢，康健地向上奮鬥，這是一個多麼大的轉變。因為這個收束有力，更使人物更富有感情。對於劇本，是應該加以贊揚的。</p>
<p>安秀麗丹演一個工人的女兒，變更了作風，一洗過去妖冶的風姿，她的路是闊的，而且也演得極好。勞勃孔敏士飾一個好學的年靑的學生，後來成為一心理治療的醫生，始終能保特他樸素的性格與身份，最後高潮，說服同伴一塲，也極洗煉。其他幾個男女演員都極好。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「好，咱們先別鬧，見仁見智，各人看怯不同。」他仍然用極堅決的語氣說：「總之，我們生意人有我們生意人的見解。現在，別的我都不管，我只知道用我全部的力量，把手裏所有的貨槍運出去。你說我為了國家也好，你說我為了自己也好！我都不管！你們文化界目光遠大，認為一定要舉行獻金勞軍，我也決不反對；並且，天地良心，你老兄說一句公平話，我老徐是不是多少也盡過了？現在，你再逼我捐那麽大的數目。這件事我兄弟實在難以效勞！</p>
<p>說到末了，他總有些　釘截鐵似的。</p>
<p>但祝兆年並沒有留給他說退。這個瘦長的人反而又在那張長沙發上坐了下云，隨手打口袋裏掬出一顆糖來，剝去了紙，欣然大嚼起來。他的視綫却一直注定了對面的徐胖子，好半嚮沒有移動。胖子給他瞧得有些窟，把臉略略側過一些，很不自然地吸着嘴角上掛的半支駱駝牌。</p>
<p>屋子裏靜默了兩三分鐘。</p>
<p>「老祝，別這樣瞅着我好不好？」　持了一會、徐紹明首先吿饒起來。「我這人也是最要朋友的。衝着你的面子，我一個人捐五萬元！這肅大家都過得去了！」說到這道裏，他忽然又壓低了聲音。一你老兄這幾天裏如果要走的話，可以隨時來找我，我們有好幾輛車子要開上獨山去，你一個人總是不成問題的。咱們自己人，也不必談錢的事！」　他想這樣老祝總可以滿意而去了。</p>
<p>「多謝你，逃難的事我還沒有想到咧！」老祝偏是那樣的不中抬舉。「我們在這兒，本來就是過的難民生活；如果真要離開桂林，當然也只配做難民。坐不坐車子沒有大關係。</p>
<p>胖子子倒沒有想到他會如此倔强。</p>
<p>「這幾夭消息很不好，據說東洋人日到了零陵，柏公館黎公館都搬空了！」他想再恐嚇一下試試看。</p>
<p>「我們無貨一身輕，等敵人眞到了挂林再走也來得及，一老祝簡直不像凖備逃難的樣子。</p>

<h3>Communist Northeast Army Again Invades the Outskirts of Dehui, Fierce Fighting Breaks Out, National Army Reinforcements Arrive to Fight Back Courageously</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The battle on the outskirts of Dehui is currently unfolding fiercely. This large-scale battle began on the 10th, with a three-pronged attack launched by Lin Biao's reorganized troops. The eastern front consists of three divisions from each of Lin's columns, crossing the river south of Wu Ke Shu. Near Xia Long Wang Miao, they reached the northwestern outskirts of Dehui City by the afternoon of the 11th. The western front is the 3rd Column of Lin's army, consisting of the 16th, 17th, and 18th Divisions, which launched a fierce attack along the Changchun-Harbin Railway, reaching the northwestern outskirts of Dehui City by the afternoon of the 11th. The central front consists of the 3rd Column of Lin's army, consisting of the 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions, launching a fierce attack on Kao Shan Tun from Wu Jia Zhan. Overall, the three-pronged offensive is extremely fierce, and the battle on the outskirts has begun. As of tonight, fierce fighting is still ongoing. The communist army has suffered five to six thousand casualties. The National Army sent reinforcements on the 11th to fight back. Furthermore, the 359th Brigade of the Communist Northeast Army has also joined the battle.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th] The battle for Dehui has resumed. The communist army has returned with renewed vigor, apparently under the strictest orders. The 16th, 17th, and 18th Divisions have reached the northwest of Dehui, while the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions are advancing rapidly from Wu Tai Fang Hui. Fierce fighting broke out on the outskirts of Dehui on the 11th. The National Army fought bravely, killing and wounding over 5,000 communist soldiers and capturing over 100, including the Chief of Staff. Fierce fighting also took place in the Kao Shan Tun area today. The communist 4th Division and the 359th Brigade, etc., launched a fierce attack on the defending troops on the evening of the 10th, repeatedly repelled by the National Army. However, the communist supervisory team used machine guns to block any retreat and repeatedly charged with hand grenades. As of the 11th, the National Army had been sending reinforcements. Furthermore, there are over 10,000 communist troops near Shulan, with a tendency to invade Wula Street. The major war in the Northeast has broken out again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 11th] Du Yuming went to Dehui by car to inspect at 1:00 PM on the 11th, arriving at 5:00 PM. He had a long conversation with Sun Liren and left Dehui at 7:30 PM, returning to Changchun at midnight. Furthermore, the person in charge of the China Changchun Railway stated that the railway between Changchun and Dehui on the northern section of the China Changchun Railway can be restored to traffic on April 5th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 12th] An unknown number of communist troops carrying heavy weapons were discovered seven li south of Qidao Hezi Ying Tang La Zi on the Ji(lin) Dun(hua) Road, and fighting has broken out with the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The battles at Jinchuan and Liuhe, where Liaoning and Jilin meet, are intensifying. Over 10,000 communist troops are advancing towards Bei Shan Cheng and Meihekou, and fierce fighting is in progress.

<h3>Communist Army Fiercely Attacks the Suburbs of Qufu, National Army Responds with Strong Counterattack, Stalemate on the Outskirts of Weixian and Changle</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] Over 20,000 communist troops launched a fierce attack on the National Army positions in the suburbs of Qufu from areas west of Sishui on the night of the 11th. They were met with a strong counterattack from the National Army, and the battle raged all night. The fighting is still intense.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] The communist army in the Sishui area has now gathered over 60,000 troops. Movements are frequent and hectic. A major battle in Sishui is imminent.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] The regimental troops advancing from Ningyang towards Da Wenkou are sweeping up the remaining communist troops in the area north of Xinji Guanzhuang, northeast of Ningyang, strengthening pacification work. Currently, there are no communist troops harassing within 25 kilometers of the outskirts of Ningyang.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Army in Jiaoxian, believing that holding on was meaningless, withdrew as of the afternoon of the 10th. The officers and soldiers who broke through suffered some casualties in combat, but no major losses. Although Jiaoxian has been abandoned, there is no danger of Qingdao being constrained. The battle of Jiaoxian began on the 4th of this month, with an estimated 60,000 communist troops attacking.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 12th] On the outskirts of Weixian and Changle, the communist army has repeatedly failed in its attacks, and a stalemate has developed in recent days.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 12th] The communist army and munitions in the southern part of the Liaodong Peninsula continue to be transported to the Shandong Peninsula on the 10th. According to reports, over 80 trucks loaded with munitions drove south from Yantai via Gaomi in recent days. On the evening of the 9th, two more divisions landed in the Yangjiao Wan area and opened west through Zhang Jianqiao southeast of Shouguang. The National Army has taken precautions.</p>
<h3>Yan'an Military Conference Decides to Launch Offensive</h3>
<p>Communist Generals in Hebei Also Meet to Discuss</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Mao Zedong convened a meeting of senior Communist military leaders in Yan'an on the 10th, deciding to launch a large-scale mountain offensive during the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to gain a favorable situation, with the battle on the outskirts of Dehui as the first step in their overall offensive.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 12th] The military announced that senior communist generals in Hebei, Nie Rongzhen, He Long, Xiao Ke, Liu Bocheng, etc., have reportedly gathered in Fuping, western Hebei, in recent days to hold a military conference, planning to conscript 200,000 militiamen to secure their old base in the Taihang Mountains. They intend to use 100,000 troops to guard the area north and south of Zijing Pass in Yixian to prevent the National Army from sweeping the Taihang Mountains and intercept the National Army's westward advance to Laiyuan. It is also claimed that another 100,000 troops will cooperate with the regular army to launch a new offensive on the entire Pinghan Railway line. Relevant sources told reporters that this news may be propaganda intended to create a false impression and may not be accurate.</p>
<h3>National Army Continues Fan-Shaped Advance in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>Recovered Rongcheng, Refugees Return Home</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 12th] After the National Army recovered Rongcheng in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, it continued to sweep through the territories of Xiongxian, Anxin, and Xinzhen. Yesterday, under the northeastern-southern fan-shaped attack, it captured three important strongholds in the evening: Antai Town in the south of Anxin, Baigou in Xiongxian, and Beiyang Village in Rongcheng, completing the triangular sweeping circle centered on Rongcheng. The fighting in western Hebei has been quiet for the past ten days.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 12th] After Rongcheng, along the Pinghan Railway on the eastern side, was recovered by the National Army, the remaining communist troops within ten li of the city have now been completely eliminated. Refugees who fled to Pingbao and other places are returning one after another. The county seat has been demolished by the communist army, most of the young people have been conscripted, and food and materials have been taken away, leaving nothing behind. The county government is now actively carrying out relief work.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 12th] Communist troop movements around Baoding are still frequent. The main force of Nie Rongzhen's troops has fled back to the area around Wucun Town in Wanxian. The National Army positions in that area have retreated slightly. Fangshun Bridge is still an area where communist troops harass.</p>
<h3>Suixian and Zhecheng Fall</h3>
<p>Two County Magistrates, One Missing, One Killed in Action</p>
<p>[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 11th] The remaining communist troops of Jin Shaoshan and Wei Fenglou's units, numbering 4,000, launched a fierce attack on Suixian City at 10:00 PM on the 9th, capturing the city at 12:00 AM that night. County Magistrate Yin Chengen led his troops in a bitter fight and has since gone missing. Furthermore, Zhecheng was captured by the communist army again on the 6th. County Magistrate Lu Fuzhi resisted until the 8th and died a heroic death.</p>
<h3>Minister Peng Discusses the Taiwan Incident, Explains the Current Military Situation in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The Ministry of Information held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 12th. Minister Peng Xuepei answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the current situation in Taiwan? Can you give us details? Will Minister Bai Chongxi go to Taiwan?</p>
<p>Answer: In the past three days, Taiwan has quickly returned to calm. Things will be completely fine in a few days. The government is happy to implement any political and economic reforms in Taiwan, and it is also trying to be lenient in handling the incident. Chairman Chiang clearly declared on the 11th that our country is about to enter a constitutional era, and the ability of the people to be responsible and disciplined is a prerequisite for the success of democratic constitutionalism. Demands such as canceling the Taiwan Garrison Command, surrendering weapons, and having all of Taiwan's army and navy staffed by Taiwanese are obviously irresponsible and undisciplined actions. Seeking democratic constitutionalism in this way will not only be like climbing a tree to catch fish, but will inevitably lead to disaster. This is something we should all jointly admonish. Minister Bai will go to Taiwan in a few days to offer condolences and handle matters expediently.</p>
<p>Question: What is the current military situation?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) In the Northeast, the communist troops under Lin Biao are gathering around Tonghua and seem ready to move, but their units are complex and their ideology is divided, so their combat effectiveness is not strong. (2) In Hebei, the communist troops under Nie Rongzhen, after their disastrous defeat at Datong, were reorganized in the area around Yixian and Mancheng. They are now moving east near Dacheng, seemingly intending to take action to support Chen Yi, but their strength is insufficient to have any effect. (3) In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area, the communist troops under Liu Bocheng suffered great losses on the Longhai Railway line and are now undergoing replenishment and training in Fanxian Yang. (4) In central Shandong, Chen Yi's troops are gathering in Mengyin, Xintai, Laiwu, Tai'an, and other places. The National Army is advancing rapidly southward and recovered Qufu, Fuyang, and other places on the 9th. Although the Chinese communists exaggerate the extent of their disruptive forces, among China's thirty-six provinces and regions, only about six or seven are experiencing actual military activity.</p>

The original text is as follows: Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already issued a statement yesterday explaining the Chinese government's attitude. What I can say is that the Chinese people have fought hard for more than eight years to win China's freedom and independence. They absolutely cannot accept the suggestion to provide their internal problems for discussion by other governments or to form an agreement by other governments, and of course, they will feel resentment. This suggestion will be regarded as infringing on China's sovereignty and China's status as a wartime ally, and this suggestion is contrary to the spirit and provisions of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that it shall not interfere in the internal affairs of member states. You may ask whether the participation of China can discuss the Chinese problem. I can emphatically answer that the participation of China and me will absolutely not affect China's view that the problem cannot be discussed.</p>

<h3>The United States, Britain, and France Unanimously Uphold Justice, Soviet Suggestion is Vetoed, Foreign Ministers Conference Does Not Discuss the China Issue</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Moscow, 11th] At the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, after the French representative also opposed the Soviet proposal to include the China issue on the agenda, the British and American representatives agreed today to have an informal discussion on the Chinese situation with the Soviet Union outside the Foreign Ministers Conference. The second suggestion made by the Soviet Foreign Minister, namely that the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, in the capacity of the signatories of the December 1945 Moscow Declaration of Foreign Ministers, consider the Chinese situation outside the Foreign Ministers Conference and issue a communiqué, was also rejected.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] US Secretary of State Marshall felt somewhat relieved today, having obtained the assistance of British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault, and finally thwarted the Soviet motion to discuss the China issue. Under the joint pressure of the US, British, and French Foreign Ministers, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov withdrew the proposal.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th] US Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement at the Foreign Ministers Conference on the 11th, the original text of which is as follows: "The Three-Power Declaration on China issued at the Moscow Conference in December 1945 was not a declaration of the Foreign Ministers Conference, but a declaration of the three Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. I believe that if matters related to China are included in the conference agenda, and China, as a member state of the conference, does not attend and participate in the decision on the agenda? and any subsequent discussions, it would be inappropriate. The Moscow Declaration is only a statement of the three countries' position on China, especially regarding the position of the two countries on their troops stationed in China. I am quite willing to exchange reports with Mr. Molotov and Mr. Bevin on the implementation of any clauses of the Moscow Declaration during my stay in Moscow, but not at the Foreign Ministers Conference."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Marshall rejected the discussion of the China issue at the Foreign Ministers Conference without the participation of a Chinese representative at the meeting he chaired on the 11th. Bidault said that it would be unfair to discuss the China issue without China's participation. Molotov explained that since the conference did not agree to include this proposal on the agenda, he would not insist on it. Bevin stated that he could discuss this issue informally but was unwilling to participate in issuing a communiqué. Bevin frankly stated that he did not want to discuss the China issue without China's participation. Molotov did not express any opinion after Bevin spoke. Today's meeting continued for three hours and twenty minutes. The meeting on the 12th will begin at 4:00 PM.</p>

There are 70 coal stations and 60 rice stations in the city to facilitate the supply. Furthermore, the material preparations in Beijing in January determined the food needed for 100,000 civil servants, but the civil servants approved by the Executive Yuan numbered only 30,000 to 40,000, so the reserves are extremely sufficient.</p>

The former involved railways, highways, shipping, postal services, etc., while the latter involved coal, cotton, etc. The principles and amounts were all passed at the meeting. However, because the center of gravity is in Shanghai, it was decided that Wang Yunwu would go to Shanghai immediately to negotiate and decide with the various manufacturers.</p>

<p>Liaoning Province to Focus on Construction This Year</p>

The strength of the militia is strong, and public security can be guaranteed. The people's lives in the province are very stable. Last year, the central task of the province was to protect transportation lines and power lines, namely, to maintain the Fengman Hydropower Station. This year, the province will engage in construction and production work, developing water conservancy in the Liao River area, improving aquatic products, and increasing the production of cotton, soybeans, and apples.

<h3>Key Points of the Gu Shouxun Verdict (Continued)</h3>
<p>Rape: After the Japanese army captured the city, they went out and raped, indulging in lust. According to statistics from the International Committee composed of foreigners, on December 16th and 17th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), more than a thousand Chinese women were raped by the Japanese army, and the methods were bizarre and cruel, unprecedented in history. For example, on December 13th, Mrs. Tao Tang, residing at No. 5 Donghonghou Lane, Zhonghua Street, was raped by the Japanese army and then had her abdomen cut open and her body burned. Mrs. Xiao Yu, a pregnant woman of nine months, Huang Guiying, a 16-year-old girl, Chen Er Guniang, and a 63-year-old village woman were also brutally raped in the Zhonghua Gate area. In Duicaoxiang Lane, Zhonghua Gate, a young village girl, Ding Xiaoguniang, was raped by thirteen Japanese soldiers. Unable to endure the pain, she cried out for help and was stabbed to death in the lower abdomen. From December 13th to 17th, outside Zhonghua Gate, after raping women, the Japanese army forced passing couples to continue the rape. A monk who refused was castrated to death. Also, outside Tucheng Head, Zhonghua Gate, three young girls committed suicide by jumping into the river out of shame and anger after being raped by the Japanese army. All Chinese women remaining in Nanjing were in constant fear and fled to the safety zone designated by the International Committee. However, the Japanese army disregarded international justice and indulged their lust, sneaking in at night, groping and raping without regard for age. Although foreigners made serious protests to the Japanese military authorities in the name of international organizations, Japanese generals Gu Shouxun and others turned a blind eye and allowed their subordinates to continue their atrocities.</p>
<p>Burning: Furthermore, wherever the Japanese army went, burning and slaughter were often carried out simultaneously. Our capital was the target of their terror policies, so the intensity of the burning was unparalleled. At the beginning of the fall of the city, large fires raged everywhere from Zhonghua Gate to the lower Yangtze River, the flames soaring into the sky, and almost half of the city was reduced to ashes. The loss of our public and private property was incalculable. Dozens of houses in Xunzhang Lane, Zhonghua Gate, were burned down, and hundreds of residents, including He Guangsen, Xia Honggui, and Bi Zhangshi, were left homeless. Hundreds of houses belonging to residents You You Nian, Chang Xu Shi, Feng Zhaoying, and others in Zhonghua Gate, Diaoyu Lane, Hubei Road, Changle Road, and Shuangzha Town were also burned down and completely destroyed. On December 20th, a planned arson attack was launched throughout the city. The Taiping Road in the city center was engulfed in flames, which did not extinguish until night. Furthermore, all fire-fighting equipment was looted, and any citizen who dared to rescue was killed without mercy.</p>
<p>Looting: The Japanese army was also extremely greedy, looting all kinds of food, livestock, utensils, and antiques. For example, at No. 50 Shiba Street, they looted four large boxes of valuable books and more than 2,000 pieces of calligraphy, paintings, antiques, 400 pieces of furniture, and more than 30 boxes of clothes belonging to Shi Tiexuan of the National Bank. In Jiqing Road, Renguan Lane, and other places, they looted countless livestock, food, and money from the people. Even the belongings of nurses, the bedding of patients, and the food of refugees in the International Red Cross Hospital were looted. The residences of Douglas Jenkins, an official of the U.S. Embassy, Miss Gertrude Stable, an American missionary, and Germans Ula Biba, Chipahede Bo, and Puluo Zhengmmsheng were also searched and looted, resulting in enormous losses. Such atrocities are too numerous to count. After Japan surrendered, Gu Shouxun was arrested in Tokyo and escorted to Nanjing by our delegation to Japan. He was investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutors of this court. (Reasons omitted) (End)</p>

<h3>The Establishment of the Economic General Staff</h3>
<p>The Supreme Economic Council, entrusted with the mission of reviving China's post-war economic construction, was established on November 26, 1945. However, in the year that has passed, nothing in the country has returned to its normal state, and there is still a long and winding road ahead towards economic recovery. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan has not passed the council's organizational law. Moreover, its nature somewhat conflicts with the various competent departments. In today's situation, where the country is striving to tighten budgets and vigorously carry out streamlining, its necessity is also worth considering. However, in order to implement emergency economic measures, the government, at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the 4th of this month, decided to change the Supreme Economic Council into the National Economic Council, changing its original mission and expanding its current responsibilities. The National Defense Supreme Council has already passed the draft organizational regulations of the council on the 6th, and it is now being sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. From the perspective of economics and world economic trends, a country's highest economic administrative organization should be its economic general staff, its position being important and its significance profound, requiring no further explanation. Whether the National Economic Council will assume this mission is a concern for the general public. Now, as the Legislative Yuan is meticulously studying the draft organizational regulations of the council and has not yet completed the third reading, we would like to express our views to provide reference:</p>
<p>1. Regarding the organization of the Economic Council: According to the regulations shown, the organization of the Supreme Economic Council consists of a chairman, concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan, a vice-chairman, concurrently held by the Vice-President, and the ministers of the economic, agricultural, forestry, and food departments as ex officio members. The National Government may also appoint five people as members. In addition, there are counselors, secretaries, and specialized members, who are divided into groups to handle various duties. When necessary, Chinese and foreign experts may be hired as consultants and advisors. According to the organizational regulations, the council seems to be entirely an administrative body, but the governing authority directly under the National Government, which holds the full administrative power, cannot interfere. Therefore, whether its system itself should be adopted requires careful consideration. This time, the reform changes the name to "National Economic Council," and the system is changed to be subordinate to the Executive Yuan, which seems more reasonable in terms of the system. Regarding personnel, in addition to increasing the chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission and the president of the Central Bank as ex officio members, there are another ten to twenty members appointed by the National Government, which seems to be intended to gather talent and pool wisdom. This is certainly a correct move in assisting the promotion of the Economic Council's work. However, whether this type of organizational form is equivalent to an economic general staff is open to question. Based on world experience and the lessons of past unreasonable organizational failures, for this institution, which is closely related to the economic lifeline of the people of the country, we should widely select representatives from the production and consumption sides, and representatives from private banks, companies, and enterprises to participate, and it should include economic experts and representatives of public opinion organs. This will enable us to synthesize opinions from all parties and achieve its assigned tasks.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the tasks of the Economic Council: According to the regulations, the tasks of the Supreme Economic Council are to complete economic recovery and improve the people's livelihood, to make full and effective use of the country's resources, to decide on major economic policies, to formulate major economic plans, and to coordinate the work of various economic departments. Its power is very strong. However, the reality shows that the domestic economic situation in recent years has not been entirely as we would like it to be. This time, the reform of the Supreme Economic Council should not only eliminate bureaucratic practices in organization and personnel, but also implement and complete democratic planned economy in its tasks. It is heard that the future National Economic Council will not only be responsible for the functions of the "Supreme Economic Council," but also preside over the "promotion of specific economic measures," such as price controls, import management, and export promotion. The "Organizational Regulations of the Price Commission of the National Economic Council" recently passed by the Executive Yuan is a large step in this direction. We believe that organizational regulations can be amended if necessary due to changes in circumstances. However, the tasks of the Economic Council should not be all-encompassing, and its functions should not be too cumbersome. At present, it should still focus on promoting emergency economic measures and stabilizing the people's livelihood. At the same time, the Economic Council should be a consultative and planning body, and its administrative affairs should still be executed by the competent ministries and commissions.</p>
<p>In short, implementing national economic policies at the present time is a complex undertaking. It is not possible to reverse the severe economic crisis without gathering wisdom and mobilizing the nation's intelligence. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee is about to convene, and will surely have discussions and resolutions on the current economic problems. Domestic economists and business people are concerned about current affairs and have valuable opinions. We hope that the government will broadly adopt public opinion after the Third Plenary Session to reverse our current economic crisis.</p>

<h3>22nd Anniversary of the Death of the Founding Father of the Nation: Chairman Leads Central Committee Members to Pay Respects at the Mausoleum, All Circles in Peiping Hold Public Memorial Service at the Empty Grave</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] The 12th was the 22nd anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father of the Nation. The Central Committee members staying in Nanjing went to the mausoleum of the Founding Father at 9:00 AM to pay their respects. A simple memorial ceremony was held, presided over by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and after Chiang offering flowers, and leading the members in paying respects at the mausoleum, the ceremony was completed. The Central Standing Committee had originally resolved not to hold a memorial service on the anniversary of the Founding Father's death.

<p>Letter to the Editor: To the Editor: Regarding the report in your March 11th edition from Hankou on the 10th about the incident involving the Zhongya transport ship, which attributed the responsibility for the incident to the seamen's discipline, claiming that a fire occurred in the ship's coal bunker, and that the Zhongya Company requested the union to replace the crew, but the union did not agree, resulting in leniency and ultimately leading to the disaster. The Zhongya transport ship was originally named Nanxiang and owned by the Nanxiang Company. The seamen serving on the ship were all former employees of Nanxiang. According to established practice, changes in ship ownership do not affect the personnel working on the ship. Our union, in order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of its members, should handle the matter accordingly. Furthermore, the ship has been operating well since its voyage, and the company has never requested the replacement of seamen due to poor discipline. As for the unfortunate incident involving the ship, the relevant authorities will surely investigate thoroughly, and it is unlikely that unsubstantiated responsibility will be placed on the seamen. We have always admired your newspaper's fair stance and truthful reporting, and we kindly request you to investigate and correct the report to set the record straight! Sincerely, The Chinese Seamen's Union, March 12th.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seven Hoarders Uncovered in Xi'an, Large Quantities of Flour Confiscated, Provincial Government's Decisive Action Pleases the People</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Xi'an dispatch, 12th] Twenty-seven hoarders were found hoarding a batch of flour worth 140 million yuan, which was decisively confiscated by the Shaanxi Provincial Government and will be distributed to public educators and staff. The proceeds will be used to support social relief efforts. A large quantity of hoarded flour is also being sealed and audited, and some will certainly be confiscated. This is an example of the authorities acting decisively after obtaining clues from news reports following the promulgation of the economic emergency measures, which has greatly pleased the citizens. However, it seems no one can prove that the black market for gold is non-existent. The Xi'an gold market, which once controlled the entire speculative market in the Northwest and saw daily transactions of hundreds of thousands of taels, now sells very little to the Central Bank, which is quite intriguing. It is also rumored that the counties along the fortified line have banned the flow of gold to the Communist areas and are strictly cracking down on drug dealers who purchase gold through illegal channels.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Has a Major Determination to Help Free Nations Defend Against Foreign Aggression, Truman Clarifies Government's Stance in Joint Session of Congress Yesterday</h3>
<p>Economic Aid Granted to Greece and Turkey</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: President Truman is preparing to deliver a speech to Congress, the text of which has been pre-released to newspapers. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>"The seriousness of the current world situation has compelled me to attend a joint session of Congress. One of the issues I want to bring to your attention and decision is the issue of Greece and Turkey. The United States has just received an urgent request from the Greek government for economic assistance. The report from the American economic delegation currently in Greece, as well as the report from the American ambassador to Greece, confirms that this assistance is necessary if Greece is to remain a free country. I do not believe that the American people and Congress will turn a deaf ear to Greece's request. Greece is not a wealthy country. Due to a lack of natural resources, the Greek people have to work hard. Since 1940, this thrifty and peace-loving country has faced four years of internal and external troubles. When the liberation army entered Greece, they found that the retreating German army had destroyed all railways, roads, transportation vehicles, and merchant ships. Over a thousand villages were destroyed, 85% of the children suffered from tuberculosis, and almost all livestock and poultry disappeared. Inflation has declared the national economy bankrupt. This tragic situation is enough to create political chaos and make economic recovery impossible. Greece today lacks the funds to import necessities. Under these circumstances, the Greeks cannot solve their construction problems. Greece urgently needs financial assistance to continue purchasing food, clothing, fuel, seeds, etc., which are essential for the people's livelihood and can only be purchased from abroad. Greece must receive assistance to import materials necessary to restore domestic order and security. Currently, the survival of the Greek state is threatened by the activities of terrorists, with armed personnel led by the Communist Party rebelling against the government, especially in the northern border areas. A Security Council investigation team is currently on the ground investigating the turmoil in northern Greece. The Greek government is currently unable to cope with the situation. The Greek army is poorly equipped and understaffed. If the government wants to restore its authority within its territory, it must be equipped. If Greece is to be a self-respecting and self-sufficient democratic country, it must receive assistance from others. The United States must provide this assistance because Greece can no longer obtain assistance from other countries. Britain used to provide some assistance, but now, due to its own difficulties, it will discontinue this assistance from March 31st. We have considered how to encourage the United Nations to assist Greece, but due to the current urgency, it is feared that the United Nations will be unable to do much.</p>
<p>"Greece's neighbor, Turkey, also deserves our attention. In the eyes of freedom-loving people around the world, the future of Turkey as an independent country is no less important than the future of Greece. Today, the situation in Turkey is very different from that in Greece. Turkey has not experienced the disasters that Greece has encountered, and the United States and Britain provided Turkey with material assistance during the war, but Turkey still needs our assistance. Since the war, Turkey has sought economic assistance from the United States and Britain to achieve the modernization necessary to maintain its national integrity, which is absolutely necessary for maintaining order in the Middle East.</p>
<p>"The goal of American foreign policy is to create an environment in which we and the people of other countries can work together freely, without being threatened. Unfortunately, several countries in the world are being threatened by totalitarian countries. The United States has repeatedly protested against all threats in Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria in violation of the Yalta Agreement. Aiding free nations resisting external pressure must be the policy of the United States.</p>
<p>"If we fail to assist Greece at this critical juncture, both the West and the East will be significantly affected. Therefore, I request Congress to authorize $400 million in loans to Greece and Turkey, ending on June 30, 1948."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The United States Congress is now prepared to accept the recommendations that President Truman will outline tomorrow and support its policy, which is not only to assist Greece, but also to support democracy and curb communism in important regions around the world.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Senator Vandenberg, the Republican leader on foreign policy, stated that the United States' intervention in the Greek situation to prevent the Communist Party from gaining control may trigger a reaction in which the United States aids other "friendly" countries, leading to a war between Soviet Communism and Western democracy, especially in China and Korea. Therefore, Vandenberg, like other senators, requested that when President Truman asks the joint session of Congress for assistance to Greece, he should also clarify the impact of intervening in the Greek situation on US-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>White House Physician Announces President Needs Rest</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: Not long before Truman attended an extraordinary joint session of Congress at 1:00 PM today (Eastern Standard Time) to announce his plan to provide economic aid to Greece to curb Communist forces in Southern Europe, the White House announced that Truman's personal physician had instructed him to immediately put aside official duties and take a short rest. The White House stated that Truman would depart from Washington for a short stay in Key West, Florida, after delivering his speech to Congress. Mr. Truman's speech will last twenty minutes and is considered the most important announcement of the post-war US diplomatic government, which will be broadcast to the world by radio and television.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: White House physician, Dr. Grayting, stated that President Truman must take absolute rest, but denied that Mr. Truman's health was in any serious condition. He stated that Mr. Truman's health was good and he was radiant, but he was exhausted from his recent trip to Mexico, which had caused him to lose weight. Therefore, he urgently needed to rest in order to recover.</p>
<h3>Marshall Proposes Unifying the Economies of the German Occupation Zones, Heated Debate Between the U.S. and Soviet Union on the Issue of Destroying German War Capacity</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] Moscow, 12th Broadcast: The Foreign Ministers' Conference held its third meeting today, with the US side proposing to unify the economies of the four occupation zones in Germany. British Foreign Secretary Bevin questioned Molotov extensively, accusing the Soviet Union of harboring Nazi war criminals. In retaliation, Bevin questioned Molotov at today's meeting about the truth of the Soviet Union's handling of German prisoners of war, with sharp and eloquent words.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 12th] The German economic unification plan proposed by Marshall at the Foreign Ministers' Conference is based on Byrnes' original proposal. According to Mr. Byrnes's proposal, six central agencies, including industry, finance, food, agriculture, foreign trade, and transportation, should be established under the guidance of the Allied Berlin Control Council, without interference from the local authorities in each occupation zone. However, the Soviet Union never accepted it. Marshall's proposal today is exactly the same as Byrnes's original proposal, except for a few additions. The Soviet Union stated that it was willing to accept the proposal to unify the entire German economy, but demanded that the authorities in each occupation zone have the right to control it. The US side believes that this would reduce the effect of unification.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] London, 12th Broadcast: The four foreign ministers met today at the Aviation Club to handle German and Austrian issues in groups. The German group, chaired by US State Department expert Murphy, simplified the German investigation report of the Allied Control Council, so that when the issue of eliminating Nazi forces and democratizing Germany is discussed in the afternoon, progress can be accelerated. The Austrian group, chaired by American Clark, reviewed the political difficulties in Austria.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Suggests Four Points to Disarm Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] Molotov proposed the following points at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today to quickly complete the disarmament of Germany: (1) The Foreign Ministers' Conference should instruct the Berlin Allied Control Council to formulate a plan to eliminate Germany's war industry by July 1, 1947, which must be fully implemented by the end of 1948 at the latest. Special attention should be paid to the liquidation of German trust organizations, etc. (2) Destroy all German war materials and all land, sea, and air force facilities within German territory. This work should be completed by the end of 1949. (3) By June 1, 1947, all German military units, including auxiliary units, will be disbanded. (4) Disband all non-German troops and concentration camps within Germany and repatriate these personnel to their home countries in accordance with previous resolutions of the Allied Control Council.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 12th] The United States is determined to strive for Soviet consent to the early unification of the German economy at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and warned the Soviet Union in an indirect way that if it does not agree, it will reduce the amount of German industrial equipment it receives as reparations. The trend of American policy was evident when the Foreign Ministers' Conference began to discuss the extremely complex German issue.</p>
<p>Large Discrepancies Between U.S. and Soviet Opinions</p>
<p>Differences of opinion between Eastern and Western countries were evident from the very beginning of the conference. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately criticized the actions of the United States and Britain in the western occupation zones of Germany, stating that the disarmament of the German side and the destruction of its war potential - heavy industry - in those occupation zones were unsatisfactory. French Foreign Minister Bidault merely stated that his country was particularly concerned with ensuring that Germany would never have the power to act again. British Foreign Secretary Bevin believed that the disarmament work was progressing smoothly. US Secretary of State Marshall's remarks were the longest, stating that the report on disarmament submitted by the United Nations Control Council for Germany was satisfactory, but the destruction of Germany's heavy industrial war potential was not progressing well. However, according to the Potsdam Agreement, the dismantling of German heavy industrial equipment for reparations must be completed after the economies of the four occupation zones in Germany are unified. If the German economy is not unified, its industrial level will naturally need to be higher than when the economy is unified.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Now Has Two Choices</p>
<p>The implication of Mr. Marshall's remarks seems to be to leave only two choices for Molotov, that is, to participate in some kind of economic system to balance the economies of the eastern and western zones of Germany, or else the United States and Britain are unwilling to dismantle most of the German factories to be used as reparations to the Soviet Union. To what extent the opinions of the two sides differ can be seen in the proposals submitted by Mr. Molotov and Mr. Marshall. Mr. Molotov's proposal called for the formulation of a special plan to quickly destroy war potential within a time limit. Mr. Marshall advocated recognizing that there had been "significant progress" in disarmament and completing the task along the established lines. Since the opinions of the two sides diverged, the Soviet proposal to include the thorny issue of China on the agenda of the conference was blocked by Mr. Marshall.</p>
<p>Bevin Drops a Diplomatic Bombshell</p>
<p>On the opening day of the conference, Mr. Marshall had suggested that the issue of troop limits in Europe be placed on the agenda. Molotov requested that a decision be postponed, and this suggestion is also still pending. When the conference intensely debated the issue of disarmament, Mr. Bevin dropped a diplomatic bombshell, saying that if the number of prisoners of war still being held outside Germany was known, "it might be worth a list." Questions about this matter had been raised many times before, but the Soviet side had never answered, and had never stated how many German prisoners of war there were in the Soviet Union. It is not yet known whether Mr. Bevin intends to pursue this question to the end.</p>
<h3>U.S. and France Exchange Views on the Ruhr Area Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 12th] According to unofficial sources, Secretary of State Marshall exchanged views with French Foreign Minister Bidault today on the control of industry in the Ruhr area. Mr. Marshall stated that although Ruhr industry should be placed under international political control, ownership of these industries must belong to the Germans. It is believed here that Mr. Marshall's explanation only indicates that the position adopted by the United States on Ruhr industry has not changed, and that it still differs from the opinion of France. However, another view is that this statement may indicate that the United States is willing to seek a compromise to reconcile the previous American policy and the recent recommendations of the French government on the Ruhr. According to this view, the exchange of opinions was not on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<h3>The Tripoli Issue Will Be Reopened</h3>
<p>Britain Advocates for International Administration</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] British officials here expect that the issue of Tripolitania (the former Italian territory in North Africa) raised at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in September 1945 will be raised again. According to reports, the Soviet Union had previously requested that the area be placed under its trusteeship. According to well-informed sources here, Britain's position on this issue is extremely delicate, and hopes to list the area as an international strategic trusteeship.</p>
<h3>Britain Still Dissents on the Former Japanese Mandated Islands Issue</h3>
<p>Advocates Equal Economic Opportunity for All Countries</p>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: At the Security Council meeting this afternoon, British representative Cadogan once again opposed the United States' trusteeship of 623 former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] British Sir Cadogan stated that Britain will raise new objections to the United States' plan to place former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific under trusteeship. At the request of Washington, the Security Council will meet at 3:00 PM today to quickly pass the United States' trusteeship plan. At that time, Cadogan will raise objections, and the main point of his opposition is the economic part of the American plan. There are no objections to the military rate and administrative portion. The British side stated that the principle of equal economic opportunity, which is stipulated in the United Nations strategic trusteeship agreement, must be strictly adhered to in all circumstances.</p>
<h3>U.S. Policy Toward Korea Will Be More Active Than Before</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 11th] Undersecretary of State Acheson told reporters today that the State Department is further exploring the situation in Korea in accordance with Marshall's instructions. Mr. Acheson's remarks seemed to support a speech by Mr. Hiltring yesterday, implying that after the Soviet Union refused to help unify Korea, the United States may promote a new provisional plan that is more active than before. Some believe that this kind of speech is beneficial to the establishment of an independent six-government in southern Korea, and implies that the United States is considering establishing a "temporary independent government" in southern Korea.</p>
<h3>Czechoslovak-French Mutual Assistance Treaty Could Be Signed in Six Weeks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] Czech Prime Minister Gottwald came here from Prague to sign a good neighborly and mutual assistance treaty with Poland, and has completed the public ceremony. He told reporters that Czechoslovakia and France will sign a mutual assistance treaty within six weeks. The two countries began negotiations last month and are about to declare them over. In addition, Czechoslovakia will begin negotiations with Romania and Bulgaria in the near future to conclude treaties. An agreement on the exchange of ethnic minorities between Czechoslovakia and Poland will also be signed in the near future.</p>
<h3>Polish and Czech Envoys Promoted</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 11th] After the Polish-Czech alliance was signed today, the embassies of both countries in each other's countries were simultaneously upgraded to embassies. A special official gazette was also published here stating that an agreement had been reached on economic issues, and a cultural treaty will also be signed in the near future.</p>

<h3>U.S. Determined to Crack Down on Communist Party Activities</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] US Secretary of Labor Schwellenbach recently proposed a suggestion to ban the Communist Party within the United States and presented various pieces of evidence to the House Labor Committee. The chairman of the committee, Hartley, immediately expressed his agreement and promised to consult with legal experts on the matter to determine the best way to ban the Communist Party. Hartley also said: The Communist Party is a threat to our way of life. We now intend to ban the Communist Party within labor unions and will implement this effectively, but we do not intend to take any further action.</p>

<h3>Egypt Plans to Abandon the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 11th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy told the Senate today that he will ask the United Nations Security Council to declare the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 invalid.

<p>Attlee Clarifies Britain's Policy Toward Egypt</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 11th] Prime Minister Attlee told former Foreign Secretary Eden, a member of the opposition party, in the House of Commons today: The Egyptian Prime Minister previously made a statement regarding the breakdown of Anglo-Egyptian limb negotiations, pointing out that the reasons for the breakdown were that Egypt could not obtain satisfaction on the following two points: (1) The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt must be an unconditional, immediate, and complete withdrawal; (2) Maintain the unity of Egypt and Sudan and restore Egypt's administrative authority in Sudan to prepare for Sudan's autonomy. Regarding the first point, the British government has agreed in the agreement established by Bevin and former Egyptian Prime Minister Matki to withdraw all British troops stationed in Egypt by 1949. British troops had previously had significant responsibilities in Egypt, and now that they are withdrawing from the country, a considerable amount of time is needed, so the 1949 deadline is not excessive. Regarding the second point, the British Foreign Secretary has clearly stated that the British government supports the existence of an autonomous government in Sudan, and that when the time comes, the Sudanese people should have complete freedom of choice, either complete independence or merger with Egypt. The British government does not intend to separate Sudan from Egypt. However, the Sudanese people are not completely the same race, culture, or religion as the Egyptian people. The Sudanese people are made up of many races, with a total population of 7 million, and they are not Muslims or speak Arabic. Therefore, the Sudanese people's right to free choice is indeed necessary.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Zheng's Speech in Greater London: China's Contribution to the Great War - Direct and Indirect Efforts Led to Victory</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 11th] Zheng Tianxi, China's Ambassador to the United Kingdom, stated in a speech at the "China and the Chinese Army" commemorative luncheon held at the Simpson Military Club in London today: China's direct and indirect contributions led the anti-aggression war towards victory. Today's luncheon was held by the Simpson Military Club to commemorate the Chinese army. Ambassador Zheng said, "You should know the contributions made by the British in enduring the insane aggression at the beginning of this great war." Zheng also stated that in addition to the huge sacrifices of human life in directly resisting aggression, indirect contributions to victory should also be commemorated, such as the construction of the Burma Road, which was a huge project comparable to the Suez Canal or the Great Wall of China. However, China is a peace-loving nation. China has fought wars with other countries, but China has never launched a war of aggression. Long before the birth of Caesar, Chinese sages had already rejected war with extremely clear words! Zheng stated: The sacrifices made by China and the Chinese people in this war have not only been recognized by the United Kingdom but have also been understood by all civilized countries. China's pioneering resistance to aggressor nations is China's glory. Zheng concluded, "We were allies in wartime, and we will always be brothers in peacetime. This friendship will not only benefit the future of China and the United Kingdom but will also benefit all mankind."</p>

<h3>Hundreds of Dependents of Taiwanese Civil Servants Arrive in Shanghai in Disarray Aboard the "Zhongxing" - Some Wounded and Penniless</h3>
<p>After the "February 28th Incident" in Taipei, the "Zhongxing" ship, which had sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan, returned to Shanghai from Shantou yesterday at 6 p.m. and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Huangpu Wharf. The ship carried more than 1,000 passengers, of whom 300-400 boarded in Keelung, mostly dependents of civil servants in Taiwan Province, who were evacuated hastily during the chaotic period. According to the ship's captain, Chen Xiqiu, the passengers boarded in extremely disarray, with 30-40 of them suffering injuries and bleeding profusely, a tragic sight. Most of them were also disheveled and penniless and were taken care of properly on board. Mr. Chen also said: "The ship's important mission to Taiwan this time was to load 160 boxes of Taiwan Bank banknotes, totaling 900 million Taiwan dollars. On the 1st of this month, when it arrived off the Zhoushan Islands from Shanghai, it learned of the 'February 28th Incident' and anchored there for a day to observe the situation. Later, on the 3rd of this month, after learning that order had been restored in Taipei, it was ordered to continue sailing, but some 60-odd passengers decided to turn back, and the company sent a small steamer to Shanghai. It arrived in Keelung on the morning of the 5th. To prevent any accidents, it was only able to dock at 2 p.m. after negotiations. It stayed in Keelung for two hours, and 500-600 people disembarked, of whom more than 100 were 'mainlanders.' Several of them were beaten by Taiwanese people for wearing civil servant uniforms.

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Mayor Wu, who attended the price conference in Nanjing, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The reporter asked him extensive questions about the price issue and the personnel arrangements of the municipal government. The mayor did not give a clear answer to the results of the price conference, saying only that they would be announced after Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu left for Shanghai tomorrow and arrived here the day after (the 14th). He also said that the prices of public utilities in the city may not be adjusted to avoid stimulating commodity prices. If public utilities suffer losses, the government may still consider subsidizing them. The distribution of in-kind rations to public school teachers and civil servants has been postponed to the 20th of this month due to the fact that the lists have not yet been compiled.</p>

He also said that Secretary-General He Dekui's resignation has been retained, and the heads of all bureaus have also expressed their intention to resign, and they have all been persuaded to stay. He also did not agree to the internal transfer of the heads of the financial bureaus, because Shanghai's tax revenue is complicated, and the heads of the financial bureaus have been dealing with it for more than a year, and they are familiar with everything, so it is better not to transfer them. However, the central government needs talent urgently and insists on the transfer, so he could not force them to stay. However, he has requested the central government to wait until the heads of the bureaus have completed the issue of the old Shanghai Municipal Council employees' retirement funds before taking up their new positions.

<h3>Old-Time Traitor Chang Yuqing: Shot in the Back of the Head and Killed; Muttered to Himself When Brought Out; Entered a State of Confusion</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chang Yuqing, the leader of the old-time traitor "Huangdao Association," was sentenced to death by the High Court. Chang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the death sentence after review. The Prosecutor-General of the Supreme Court ordered the High Prosecutor's Office to carry out the sentence by telegraph on the 29th with the code "Jie." After receiving the telegram, the High Prosecutor's Office sent prosecutors Sun Xiangrong and Lin Wopeng, carrying the execution order, to the High Court Detention Center at 11:30 a.m. yesterday to bring out Chang. Chang was wearing an old dark gray silk-faced camel hair robe, a small black velvet hat, blue silk leggings, and black cotton shoes. He was fat, and two bailiffs held him as they walked to the public case prepared in advance. Knowing that his death was near, his face suddenly turned pale. He stated: He was 63 years old, from Jiangling, Hubei, and lived at Fuzimiao, Nanjing. The prosecutor handed the Supreme Court's verdict to Chang to read, and instructed him, "The order has been given to execute you today. Do you have any last words?" Chang replied, "My family has not come, I have nothing to say," and muttered to himself, "I still want to appeal." At this time, Chang's mind was in a state of confusion. He was then ordered to put his handprint on the document, put on handcuffs, and escorted by bailiffs to the new execution ground behind the police hospital. Bailiff Weng Yunquan shot Chang in the back of the head, and the bullet exited through his right cheek. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely, and died instantly. The time was exactly 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m., the District Prosecutor's Office sent prosecutors to examine the body. Chang Yuqing's younger brother, Chang Yuting, who lived at 14 Taicheng Lane, Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu, did not know the news of his brother's death and came to visit him in prison. The District Prosecutor's Office prosecutors handed over Chang's body to Chang Yuting to claim. Later, a hearse from the Shangtian Funeral Parlor was sent to the autopsy office on Hede Road for examination, and then transported to the funeral parlor for burial. This murdering demon who relied on the power of the enemy has passed away.</p>
<p>Chang was formerly the owner of the Daguan Garden Bathhouse in this city. When the January 28th Incident occurred, he colluded with Hu Lifu and others to become a traitor. Later, Hu was arrested and executed, but Chang escaped and disappeared for a long time. It was once heard that he was in the Northeast. After the August 13th Incident, he reappeared and became the leader of the "Huangdao Association." Many people were sacrificed under his control. Today, he was executed according to law, which was welcomed by all who heard about it. (The above picture shows the identification of the body before the execution, and the picture below shows the body after the execution. Photographed by this newspaper)</p>

This has been admitted by the defendant and is supported by seized account books and vouchers. The defendant has tried to evade and conceal the nature of New Asia and Alpes companies and his personal position in the two companies. However, during the court hearing on the 8th of this month, he disclosed that New Asia and Alpes companies are limited liability companies registered in the United States, and are essentially banking organizations. He also admitted to being the manager of both companies when questioned by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters during the case investigation. As for the defendant's buying and selling of US dollars and other foreign currencies, and his role in determining prices, in addition to the testimony of Bolivia, an employee of both companies, at the Garrison Headquarters, the defendant also admitted that after February 17th, "remittances were based on market prices," and "market prices were the prices at which buyers and sellers were willing to transact." When questioned about the prices at which he bought and sold US dollars during the initial interrogation, he stated: "The highest buying price was 14,700 yuan in legal tender, and the lowest was over 12,000 yuan. The highest selling price was 15,000 yuan, and the lowest was also above 12,000 yuan." It is clear that he was buying and selling foreign currencies such as US dollars without adhering to the prices stipulated by the government. Furthermore, based on various pieces of evidence, the thirteenth book in the seized evidence register compiled by the Garrison Headquarters, from page 43 to page 57, contains records of each transaction in which he bought and sold foreign currencies at black market prices. The twelfth and thirteenth books also record that after the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, he bought and sold large amounts of foreign currencies with cash or telegraphic transfers. The nineteenth item is a collection of original vouchers seized on the spot, documenting the defendant's determination of black market prices for foreign currencies. In addition, a large amount of illicit funds, including US$345,310 and Hong Kong dollars, were also seized on the spot. This sufficiently proves that the defendant's crime is indeed a fact. It is believed that the defendant used the substantial funds of New Asia and Alpes companies to set black market prices, buy and sell foreign currencies, engage in speculation and manipulation, and disrupt finance, which is a serious offense. It constitutes a violation of Article 7 of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency, and is therefore being publicly prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>It is understood that "Foreign Tiger" is the first case of a person being arrested by the authorities and prosecuted by the court for engaging in black market trading in violation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan after its promulgation.</p>
<h3>A Tragic Incident: Son Slashed with a Knife, Father Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhao Huanbin, a 44-year-old Shandong native residing at No. 4445 Yuqing Lane, Changshou Road, Shanghai West, for unknown reasons, used a kitchen knife to slash his son, Songquan (22 years old), injuring his forehead, the top of his head, and both hands at around 4:20 AM yesterday. Songquan, wounded, ran to the Putuo Road Police Station to report the incident. Officer Guan Zhaoyi rushed to investigate, only to find that Zhao Huanbin had tightly closed the door and refused to respond to knocking. He then, together with the sub-landlord Wu Yingzhou, opened the door and found Zhao had cut his neck with scissors and injured his skull, his breath weak. Both father and son were sent to the hospital for treatment. According to Wu Yingzhou, Zhao Huanbin and his wife, Zhao Zhang, often argued. Last month, Zhang, unable to bear the disturbances, angrily left and went to her daughter's place in Qingdao. Only the father and son were left in Shanghai. Recently, Zhao Huanbin and his son had frequent conflicts. It was apparent that the father seemed to be suffering from a mental illness, leading to this tragedy. It is reported that the injuries of both father and son are severe, and as of midnight yesterday, they were still in critical condition.</p>

<h3>Truck Auction: Eating the Debt, Enemy Property Clearance Office's Appeal to the High Court Still Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Last June, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau entrusted the Jianghai Customs with the twenty-fifth auction of eight cargo trucks. Among them, six trucks were won by the Da Hu Transportation Company at a bid of 11,710,000 yuan. The manager of the company, Yuan Lianqi, paid 6 million yuan in cash and three crossed checks from the Daya Bank with a date of June 26, totaling 5,710,000 yuan. The remaining two trucks were won by Zheng Liangcai of the Gongji Company at a bid of 7,050,000 yuan. 3,050,000 yuan was also paid with a Daya Bank check dated June 27. Unexpectedly, the Daya Bank suspended check clearing from the 28th and declared liquidation on the 29th, causing the Bureau's check payments to be uncashed. The legal representative of the Bureau, Liu Gongyun, sued the Da Hu and Gongji companies in the civil division of the district court, requesting a judgment ordering them to repay the check amounts, but the judgment was rejected. Liu Gongyun disagreed and appealed to the High Court in his capacity as the legal representative of the Clearance Office of the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau of the China Trust Bureau. The second instance of the case was announced yesterday. It was held that the drawer of the check was the Shanghai Daya Bank, and the check was personally signed by the bank's vice president. According to the provisions of Article 2 of the Check Law, the Daya Bank should be responsible, and the appellee has no debt liability. Therefore, the appeal was rejected, and the costs of the second instance shall be borne by the appellant.</p>

<h3>Accused of Conspiracy: Prosecution of Plainclothes Police Officer Wang Xiaoyun for Corruption, Huang Yubang, etc. is not a False Accusation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Prosecutor's Office received the case of Wang Bin, Huang Yubang, and Wang Weihou's false accusation against Wang Xiaoyun, a plainclothes police officer of the Penglai Branch, from the police bureau on February 19th. Prosecutor Wu Qihua conducted an investigation and detained the three suspects. The investigation has now concluded. The prosecutor found that Huang Yubang and others were not falsely accusing, and Wang Xiaoyun was indeed suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty. Therefore, Wang has been prosecuted. Wang Weihou and Huang Yubang used to engage in theft and paid protection money to Wang. Later, they were sentenced to imprisonment by the criminal division of the district court. After being released from prison, they reformed themselves, and their "tribute" to Wang was also interrupted. Wang then detained the thief Hu Zhifang at No. 242 Fumin Road, a teahouse opened by Wang, on February 5th, and ordered Hu to identify Huang Yubang and Wang Weihou as accomplices in theft, and detained the two. He secretly ordered Wang Bin (Wang's informer) to detain the two, but invited them to the teahouse that night to negotiate, extorting 300,000 yuan. Afterwards, Huang Wangbang and Wang Weihou reported the incident to the Inspectorate of the Police Bureau. The police bureau's investigation concluded that the accusations were unsubstantiated and suspected of false accusation, and transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The prosecutor summoned Hu Zhifang (who was in custody for another crime) and conducted investigations from various aspects, concluding that Wang was indeed suspected of corruption, and Huang Yubang, Wang Weihou, and Wang Bin were innocent.</p>

<p>Letter Received: Having read your newspaper's publication of the news "Arrangement of the Execution Ground for the Execution of the Death Sentence for the Convicted Chang Banqing," which stated that "the Chief Prosecutor of this Court indicated that the order to execute Chang could be issued tonight," this is inconsistent with the facts. The Chief Prosecutor of this Court has not met with reporters recently, and the execution order for Chang was only received at 9 AM today. In fact, it was not possible to express that yesterday. Furthermore, the execution of the death sentence must be kept secret beforehand, and there is no way to announce it beforehand. Please investigate and correct this. Sincerely, Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office Secretariat.</p>

<h3>Qingxia Relief Fund for Orphans, Widows, the Poor, and the Sick: Ninth Approved Application for Nine People (Continued)</h3>

I served in the rear during the war and, when my hometown was invaded, I returned to Shanghai to search for my wife but was unable to find her, leading to the experience of unbearable separation. Now my elderly mother is ill and her life is hanging by a thread, but because of poverty, I can only sit and wait for death and cannot fulfill my duties as a son.

<h3>Inspecting Ships, Dividing Responsibilities, Setting Up Lifeboats at Wusong Port: Harbor Management Resolutions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Harbor Management Committee held its 22nd meeting yesterday. When discussing the issue of reorganizing warehouses throughout the city, the Warehouse and Wharf Group put forward four points: (1) The congestion of goods in the Mai Gen Road General Warehouse is noteworthy. (2) The large amount of enemy and puppet grass ropes and grass bags stored in the No. 9 Wharf Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau are actually useless and occupy warehouse space. (3) It seems inappropriate for a certain division to occupy the No. 9 Wharf Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau. (4) There is an uneven distribution of cargo stacking among warehouses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are as many as eight units inspecting ships from military and police agencies, which is cumbersome and difficult to manage. It was resolved that customs will uniformly check tax matters, and the police bureau will convene relevant units to discuss inspection methods for public security matters, to be submitted to the next meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>At the same time, it was also decided to set up one or two lifeboats at Wusong Port, and it is proposed to ask the Executive Headquarters to find a way to allocate them. The seaport quarantine station will be responsible for rescue affairs. Before the equipment is perfect, the quarantine speedboat will temporarily take on the task.</p>

<h3>Sichuan Education Department Takes Over Four National Schools</h3>

<h3>World Languages: English Most Prevalent, Chinese Second, American Experts Advocate Spelling Reform</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 11th] The World Linguistics Society recently published a report advocating "One World, One Language" ideology. If everyone learned the same language, everything would be simplified. English is the most prevalent language in the world, with over 400 million speakers scattered across the globe. The second most prevalent is Mandarin Chinese, spoken by 200 million people. Although English is very common, it is not a unified world language. It is difficult for foreigners to learn English, and even native speakers find mastering the spelling requires years of hard work. The society's president, Owen, advocates adopting a new alphabet, personally creating a universally applicable alphabet of 37 letters, representing every sound in any language. Each letter represents one sound, so with this alphabet, English could be learned in a matter of months. Phonetics expert Laubach, however, has a different opinion, advocating retaining the original 26 letters and simply reforming the spelling. Other languages can do this, so why can't English? About 20% of English words in the dictionary should be modified so that their spelling and pronunciation are completely the same. For example, "Though," "Tough," "Cough," "Plough," and "Through" should be respelled as "Thoa," "Tuf," "Kawfi," "Plow," and "Throo." This way it would be "eeze enuf for anibodi" (easy enough for anybody).</p>

<h3>Temporary Measures for Aiding Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China Experiencing Difficulties</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, considering the chaotic situations often occurring in overseas Chinese residential areas, which affects the ability of returning overseas Chinese students to receive financial support for their studies, has drafted the following "Temporary Measures for Aiding Overseas Chinese Students Returning to China Experiencing Difficulties": (1) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission hereby establishes these measures for the purpose of providing temporary assistance to overseas Chinese students returning to China for their studies and experiencing difficulties. (2) Overseas Chinese students studying at public or registered private secondary or higher education institutions in China who encounter one of the following situations may request temporary assistance in accordance with the provisions of these measures: (1) The overseas Chinese residential area where their parents reside is in a chaotic situation, and funds are exhausted; (2) Remittances from the overseas Chinese residential area where their parents reside are disrupted, and funds are exhausted; (3) They suddenly suffer from a serious illness and are unable to afford medical treatment. (3) Overseas Chinese students requesting assistance should provide a detailed account of their family's current situation, along with their overseas Chinese student ID and other relevant documents, to the school they are attending, which will then forward the application to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for review. (4) If the request for assistance from an overseas Chinese student is verified to be true, the assistance funds will be allocated by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to the school they are attending for distribution.</p>
<h3>Professional Training for Normal School Students</h3>
<p>Rewards and Punishments Based on Performance</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The Ministry of Education is strengthening professional training for normal school students and has established assessment measures, dividing training into four major categories: "Academic," "Spiritual," "Life," and "Professional."

It was then decided: (1) The City Scholarship Loan Committee for Needy Students will borrow 50 million from national banks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, as well as the Central Trust Bureau, the Postal Savings Bureau, and the Central Cooperative Treasury, the City Bank, at a monthly interest rate of 4%, to be repaid in two months, with the City Bank acting as guarantor.

(3) 500 million will be reserved under the education expenditure item in the City Government's general budget for this year as a loan guarantee fund. (4) The Shanghai Scholarship Fund for Needy Students will be changed to the Shanghai Scholarship Loan Program for Needy Students. (5) Needy students applying for scholarship loans should have their application guaranteed by the faculty and staff of the school they are attending and repay the loan in installments without interest after graduation. As for the fundraising issue, the committee members exchanged views at yesterday's tea party, but no concrete decision was made. It is generally planned to jointly raise 200 million from various national banks and bureaus, 150 million from China Textile Industries Corporation, 100 million from private yarn factories, and 50 million from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industries. The method of sporadic fundraising by students in the past will not be adopted. However, Mr. Wu Yun-chu immediately pledged to donate 10 million yesterday.</p>

<h3>Operating Expenses of Private Schools Should Not Rely on Tuition Income, Executive Yuan Orders City Government to Notify</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Government recently received an instruction from the Executive Yuan (Jiu Zi No. 6123) stating: "A letter from the Civil Service Office of the National Government, regarding the submission of a petition from 109 private secondary schools in Shanghai received by Committee Member Niu Yong-jian during his visit to Shanghai. As the Shanghai Municipal Council has been formally established, point 5 of the original petition need not be addressed. The remaining points have been instructed to be reviewed by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry's response is as follows: "Each section of the original petition has been reviewed as follows: (1) Regarding the request for government grants to private schools, the Ministry has long attached importance to assisting private schools and has implemented it in practice over the years. This year, with the restoration of schools, all provinces and cities have been instructed to allocate funds from the provincial and municipal education restoration funds to subsidize private schools to facilitate their restoration. (2) Regarding the request for an increase in private school tuition fees, private school tuition fees are appropriately increased each year according to price levels. However, according to regulations, the operating expenses of private schools should be covered by interest from the school's assets and funds or raised by the board of directors, and should not rely on tuition income. (3) The so-called formulation of laws and regulations to protect school buildings involves school rights and is not something that the Ministry can handle. (4) Regarding the request to reward principals and teachers at all levels who complied with laws and regulations and stood their ground during the war, each school should submit a special report for review," etc. Article 100 of the Land Law stipulates that the lessor may not take back the house unless one of the following circumstances exists, and Article 97 of the same law also imposes restrictions. If landlords of private primary and secondary schools in Shanghai take back school buildings on the pretext of doing so, or demand exorbitant rents, and a dispute arises, they can be handled in accordance with Article 101 of the Land Law. The Ministry of Education's proposals (1), (2), and (4) should be approved and implemented. In addition to notifying the Ministry of Education, the Municipal Government is hereby ordered to forward this notice to all private primary and secondary schools in the city for their information."</p>
<h3>People's Education Center Commemorates Arbor Day, Held Mass Meeting Yesterday Morning</h3>

<h3>Public Disclosure of Private School Finances, Teachers Investigated Accounts, Principal Used Violence</h3>
<p>Faculty and Staff File Lawsuit with District Court</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Lu Tie-min, the principal of Tiehua Private Primary and Secondary School at No. 120 Julu Road, this city, has recently been sued by the Faculty and Staff Association in the District Court. Xue Yu-shan, a member of the school's Economic Audit Committee, and other members went to the principal's office to check the accounts and discovered that Principal Lu Tie-min was suspected of embezzling 3 million in deposits. When they confronted him, the principal and his wife initially prevaricated, and then resorted to violence, causing injuries. At the same time, they falsely accused them of theft. Xue Yu-shan was abruptly dismissed on the same day, and the dismissal letter stated: "Mr. Xue has expressed dissatisfaction with the school's administrative facilities and seems difficult to cooperate with in harmony. Moreover, today's uncivilized behavior makes it even more difficult to retain him." The Faculty and Staff Association of the school believes that the organization of an audit committee to check the school's finances publicly was originally mandated by the Education Bureau. The fact that violence was used because of this is obviously illegal. Therefore, in addition to filing a lawsuit with the District Court, they have also reported the situation to the City Education Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>English Football Association Replies Welcoming, Singapore Island to Tour Europe at the End of May, Will Play Against British Professional and First Division Teams, Total of 20 Soldiers Recruit Famous Players from Hong Kong and Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Air Mail] In order to improve, the Singapore Island Sports Association asked the Hong Kong Football Association to introduce them to the English Football Association, planning to lead a team to England to observe after the end of this football season. The English Football Association reportedly replied by telegram, stating that they would accept it in principle and asking the Singapore Island what teams they wanted to play against when they arrived in England.

<h3>Three College Basketball Games Today</h3>

<p>The first game is between the Faculty of Law and Tongde in the College Group. The strength of both sides is similar, and it is difficult to predict the winner once they meet.

<h3>Mayor's Cup Football Preliminary Replay, Qingbai Eliminated Railway Yesterday, Two to Zero, One Goal in Each Half, Qingbai's Defense Line is Strong and Impenetrable</h3>
<p>In the Mayor's Cup football preliminary replay, Qingbai and Railway fought at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. The audience was not as large as expected, totaling more than 2,000 people. The leaders of both teams, Wang Xin-heng of Qingbai and Wang Zhao-huai of Railway, personally came to the stadium to supervise the battle. As a result of the competition, Qingbai relied on the efforts of all three armies, scoring one goal in each half, eliminating Railway with a score of two to zero.</p>
<p>Gu Yisa Opened the Record</p>
<p>The referee was temporarily changed to Le Xiu-rong, with Huang Ren-yi and Wang Chong-ye as assistant referees. The game started at 3:30 PM. Qingbai took the initiative to attack. In less than two minutes, Li Yi-chen headed the ball in front of the Railway goal, and Liao Xiong left his post without authorization. Fortunately, Le Ren-xiao cleared the danger with a big kick. Qingbai continued to attack relentlessly, and the Railway goal was in constant danger. Jiang Wen-qing shot from the right corner, but failed. Lazy Niu cut in again, but was saved by Liao Xiong into a corner kick. At the 12th minute, Xiao Zi-wen took a free kick from 15 yards in front of the Qingbai goal, which was tricky and fast, but was saved by Qin Bi-gao. At the 26th minute, Mei Jian-qing's corner kick was headed by Li Yi-chen, but it was ruled invalid due to a collision foul with Liao Xiong. Eight minutes before the end of the first half, Qingbai attacked again. Li Yi-chen shot again, and Liao Xiong missed. Gu Yisa rushed to the scene and touched the ball into the net, opening the record with a score of one to zero. Although Railway tried to counterattack, the first half had already ended.</p>
<p>Li Yi-chen Scored Another Goal</p>
<p>After the break, the two sides fought again. Qingbai's original lineup remained unchanged, while Lu Bing-sheng retired from Railway and Fei Chun-lin took the field. Railway attacked, but Yan Shi-xin was stationed in the back, as solid as a rock. Meng Yi-liang and Qu Yong-fu assisted in the defense, and Railway had no chance to take advantage. In the chaotic battle until the 28th minute, Jiang Wen-qing took a corner kick, which landed in a great spot. Li Yi-chen took the opportunity to attack, shooting into the net from five yards away, giving Qingbai another victory with a score of two to zero. Railway worked together to counterattack, and Xiao Zi-wen and Wu Bing-hao had many opportunities to attack, but they were all saved by Yan Shi-xin and Wu Jia-lu one by one. Ten minutes before the end, Xiao Zi-wen lobbed the ball, and Lu Qing-xiang headed it in, but it was again saved by Qin Bi-gao into a corner kick. Before long, the final whistle sounded, and Railway was eliminated by Qingbai with a score of 0-2. The lineups of both sides yesterday are as follows.</p>
<p>Qingbai</p>
<p>Qin Bi-gao, Yan Shi-xin, Wu Jia-lu, Qu Yong-fu, Meng Yi-liang, Xue Pei-ran, Zhang Shi-yi, Luo Shou-fu, Li Yi-chen, Gu Yisa, Jiang Wen-qing</p>

<h3>Public Badminton Match Yesterday: Mixed Doubles, Two Pairs, Hong Dequan and Miss Zhang Meili Win</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday evening's public badminton match originally had one preliminary-level singles match and one advanced-level singles match each, and two mixed doubles matches. In the preliminary-level singles semi-final, Hua Jiajie was against Siba, but the latter requested a postponement due to illness.

In the mixed doubles (1), An Wei and Mrs. Qu Luola won against Zeng Hongran and Miss Ye Jingxiong two to zero. (2) Hong Dequan and Miss Zhang Meili won against Ivanoff and Mrs. Fu Mixigen two to zero.</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles</p>
<p>(1) In the mixed doubles match between An Wei and Mrs. Qu Luola versus Zeng Hongran and Miss Ye Jingxiong, An and Qu had closer teamwork, so they led in points. They won the first game fifteen to ten. In the second game, after An and others scored eight points, Zeng and Ye began to chase quickly, scoring six consecutive points. An and Qu also did not relax and won again fifteen to eight.</p>
<p>An Wei Qu Luola (fifteen to ten fifteen to eight) Zeng Hongran Ye Jingxiong</p>
<p>(2) In the match between Hong Dequan and Miss Zhang Meili versus Ivanoff and Mrs. Fu Zhuxigen, Hong and Zhang had a strong momentum and often gained the upper hand. Mrs. Fu's golden hair, red vest, and fit figure concentrated the audience's attention. Hong and Zhang won the first game fifteen to three.</p>
<p>In the second game, they were evenly matched at the beginning. After each scoring two, they were neck and neck. Hong's smashes were quite fierce, and Ivanoff retaliated in kind. In the end, Hong and Zhang still won fifteen to four.</p>
<p>Hong Dequan Zhang Meili (fifteen to three fifteen to four) Ivanoff Fu Mixigen</p>
<p>Donghua Arranges Lineup to Clearly Battle British Navy</p>
<p>The British Pacific Fleet's Bellfirth, Guardian, Comet, Kirk, and other four warships, after arriving in Shanghai last week, in order to foster friendship between China and Britain, will form a soccer team composed of mixed teams tomorrow at 4 PM to challenge the reigning champion of this year's league, Donghua Team, in a friendly match at Yiyuan Stadium. This friendly match is sponsored by the Physical Education Association's Soccer Committee. To limit the audience, tickets are sold in two denominations: three thousand and five thousand. The referee has also been arranged, with Shen Huichun, who has been resting for a long time, officiating, and He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang as linesmen.</p>
<p>The starting lineup for both sides will be announced today. Because Li Yao is in Shanghai, he may be able to return in time, but it is still under consideration. The British Navy mixed team held selections at the Russian Emigrant Sports Association yesterday. When the Chinese and British athletes compete, the excitement will be obvious.</p>
<h3>Primary School Physical Education Teachers' Association Orders Early Exercise Teaching Materials for Primary Schools</h3>
<p>The city's primary school physical education teachers' association for liaison and advanced studies held its third board of directors and supervisors meeting yesterday at the city gymnasium. Board members and supervisors Yao Minghua, Jiang Ronghua, Zhang Yin, Jiang Xinping, Zhang Yundao, Zhu Bingkang, and others attended. It was decided that a equipment research class will be established first on the afternoon of March 24. Registration locations are Zou Yinlu at He'an Primary School, Zhang Yin (Jiang Ronghua at the Tenth District, Second Center, in the Shanghai West District).

It is also heard that the association is currently widely recruiting members and plans to hold a general meeting of members in mid-April.</p>
<h3>Exciting First Division Basketball Match: Shantou Team Meets Chunmao Tonight, Renyu Faces Navy Youth, There Will Be a Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>The third act of the First Division Basketball League will continue at the City Gymnasium starting at 6 PM tonight. There will be two First Division matches, both with tense and exciting scenes. At 6 PM, Shantou Team will play Chunmao, and the outcome will affect the championship. At 8 PM, Renyu will play Navy Youth, which will be a battle for ranking. Tickets are still sold for two thousand and three thousand. The order of matches is as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou Team - Chunmao (First Division) 6 PM</p>
<p>Jiashen - Railway Shanghai (Second Division) 7 PM</p>
<p>Renyu - Navy Youth (First Division) 8 PM</p>
<p>The opening act of Shantou Team versus Chunmao is quite relevant to the First Division championship. Chunmao has six wins and three losses, so they have no hope of winning the championship, but Shantou Team has won every match and their calls for the championship are very high. They attach great importance to this battle. Ma Canxi and Cai Yanxiong are resourceful and will definitely have brilliant plans to secure victory, while Chen Qingjiang, He Lide, and Lin Weicong's aggressiveness is secondary. Chunmao once had a surprise upset, defeating the Hua Lianmeng champion, so they are not an "easy to deal with" team either, but whether the main player Liu Fushan can play due to injury is still a question.</p>
<p>The second match is between Jiashen and Railway Shanghai in the Second Division, and the outcome is not important. The final match is between Renyu and Navy Youth in the First Division. After the foreign troops were poisoned by Encas the other day, their future is bleak. Today is Renyu's last battle in this group, and they should be able to display their excellent basketball skills and have a good fight with the foreign troops.</p>
<h3>Talking About Participating in the World Games</h3>
<p>— Wu Bangwei</p>
<p>There should be no problem for our country to participate in the 14th World Games to be held in England next year. The China National Sports Advancement Association is also preparing, and as long as the funding is available, everything will proceed smoothly. What the author wants to propose for discussion is not the question of participation, but how to determine our purpose and therefore plan an appropriate method to ensure that this participation in the World Games will indeed have some benefit for our country's present and future.</p>
<p>Since we estimate our strength and it is difficult to have a chance of winning in the World Games, and we clearly know that the ultimate goal of the World Games is not the gain or loss of trophies, we should assume another purpose for participating in this World Games.</p>
<p>I remember ten years ago when I went to Berlin to participate in the 11th World Games, we passed through various European countries, and everyone thought we were Japanese. When we explained that we were Chinese, they were very surprised and greatly interested. From this experience, it can be seen that we are too isolated from European countries. After this victory, we should take advantage of the deep impression of China in their minds and the hope to further know everything about China and the Chinese people, to give them a satisfactory promotion, so as to enhance friendship and understanding between each other. Regarding this level, it seems far from sports, but it is clear to everyone, so let's leave it aside for now.</p>
<p>The China National Sports Advancement Association has discussed the issue of inviting the World Games to be held in China in 1956. We do have the qualification and need to issue this invitation because we are one of the world's four great powers. I think the World Games Committee will definitely be happy to accept this invitation. The problem is that we really know too little about the holding of the World Games. For example, in the few sports we are familiar with, such as track and field, swimming, soccer, basketball, etc., we may still be able to handle them well, but what about the other sports? Many have only heard of them, but have never seen them. Many have seen them, but do not know the details. Under these circumstances, if the World Games were really held in China, how would we handle it?</p>
<p>Therefore, our participation in this World Games is not aimed at trophies, but to use this opportunity to enhance international relations, and at the same time to learn the organization and methods of various activities of the World Games, to prepare for us to host the 16th World Games. Based on this purpose, this view, I think the delegation we send to the World Games must have many personnel, a complete lineup, and definitely not like the 10th World Games, with one athlete and a few staff members holding the national flag to decorate the facade, nor like the 11th World Games, participating in seven or eight sports and neglecting others.</p>
<p>Many people, from another point of view, agree to only send soccer and basketball teams and a few qualified track and field athletes to participate, of course, there are sufficient reasons. However, for the aforementioned purpose, I agree with universal dispatch. In addition to soccer, basketball, and track and field, it is not that we have no talent to choose, but we do not pay much attention to other sports, rarely promote them, and there are even fewer opportunities for competition, so these talents are buried and unheard of. According to my inference, when these talents attend the competition, their results may not be proportionally worse than the results of soccer, basketball, and track and field athletes compared to foreigners. In the past, we always selected athletes from schools or narrow sports circles. In fact, we can find sharpshooters from the military and police, weightlifting champions from farmers and workers, good boxing and wrestling materials from the national martial arts community, and talents with various different skills from other special environments. We should widely solicit, train, and make most or all sports in the World Games have a few athletes participating. Only then can we know everything about the World Games and step into every international competitive sports organization. If we always stick to the same old ways and stick to a few common sports in the country, we will forever be isolated from the vast scope of international sports.</p>
<p>In addition to dispatching athletes, we must also pay attention to the selection of instructors. Those who serve as instructors must have a considerable foundation in knowledge and skills for the sport they are in charge of. In addition to leading and instructing athletes to participate in various competitions, so that athletes can gain practical experience and knowledge from the competitions, they should also investigate the methods of construction equipment, organizational management techniques of this sport, and contact and ask the key personnel of various international competitive sports organizations more, so that they can lead this sport after returning to the country and make it develop in the country. If the World Games are invited to China, they will be the cadres who cooperate with the technical personnel of various international competitive sports organizations.</p>
<p>As for the selection of athletes, whether it is through the opportunity of the National Games or holding a separate preliminary meeting, both are possible, and it is better to implement both concurrently, because many sports may not be included in the National Games. However, the selection committee must immediately formulate a method and entrust various local sports fields, sports organizations, schools, military and police agencies, troops, or individuals to find the talents we need and train them well. A considerable period of time before the registration deadline for the World Games, make a final selection based on each person's skills. Whether this selection needs standards is a matter of opinion, and everyone has different opinions, which is up to the person in charge to decide. My humble opinion is to provide it for the reference of the officials in charge of participating in the World Games.</p>

After three hours of discussion, a final solution was finally reached. However, it still needs to be approved by the Executive Yuan before it can be implemented. It is estimated that the total amount of export Chinese tea purchased as a result will reach 100,000 dan. This includes 80,000 dan of tea for which mortgage loans have been negotiated and 20,000 dan of tea for which no negotiations have been completed.</p>
<p>The solution decided yesterday is still to maintain the Central Bank's original purchase plan. However, according to the original central purchase price, i.e., 300,000 yuan for Pinglv, 400,000 yuan for Tunlv, and 500,000 yuan for Qihong, the Central Trust Bureau will provide a loan of 120% in the form of packing loans. This loan should first be used to repay the tea loans mortgaged at 70% by the tea merchants at the Farmers Bank of China. As for the promotion of tea sales, it was decided that the China Trust Bureau and the tea merchants would jointly form a joint marketing committee. The China Trust Bureau is responsible for supervision and strives to sell all tea within three months. The profits from the sales will be distributed at a ratio of 70% for tea merchants and 30% for the Central Bank.</p>
<h3>Hua Stocks Rebound, Retail Investors Patronize Unpopular Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the battle between bulls and bears in Hua stocks was even more intense. Deyong Yarn formed a tug-of-war, rising and falling by only a hundred yuan or so. Finally, due to the unusually loose monetary conditions, the afternoon transaction was on a next-day delivery basis. Retail investors were fearless, and the market suddenly rebounded at the close.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, Nos. 198, 47, 49, 185, and 78 were sold, while Nos. 94, 97, and 85 were bought. There was a lot of hovering at the opening. No. 76 was bought and sold immediately. Nos. 185, 152, 223, 91, 84, 235, and 22 were also sold, and Deyong Yarn was forced down to the 3,000 yuan level. Nos. 12, 149, 94, 232, 31, 179, 32, 155, and 162 were all bought. National Goods rose to the limit, once rebounding to 3,120 yuan. Nos. 97, 4, 76, 220, 207, 223, 148, and 167 were sold off in succession, and the price fell back to 2,980 yuan. Nos. 133, 218, 102, 184, 94, etc. were all bought. Near noon, the price was again close to the 3,100 yuan level. The closing price at noon was still hovering. As a result, compared with the previous close, Deyong Yarn and Meyer slightly declined, Xinhuo and Huafeng fell by more than half a percent, Jingfu, Xinguang, Dongxing, and Xinhua each fell by one percent. In the next-day delivery market, Deyong Yarn and Meyer slightly declined, Xinhuo and Huafeng and Xinguang fell by half a percent, and Jingfu fell by less than one percent. The unpopular stocks Tongyi and Zhongfang fell by slightly less than one percent. Only National Goods rose to the limit. Datong, Xinya, and Yonggong each rose by about half a percent. The rest rose or fell differently.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, only spot transactions were made. Because of the next-day delivery relationship, retail buying suddenly became active. Nos. 199, 84, 142, 223, 4, 231, 133, 36, and 94 were all bought and immediately rose. Commerce, Yonggong, Zhongfa, Datong, Xinya, Zhongsiliu, Jiufu, and Meyer all rose to the limit, and people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Although Nos. 198, 97, and 224, 61, etc. were sold, No. 207 was bought again, and the price was repeatedly raised to 3,300 yuan. No. 218, etc. sold off at high prices, and then the price hovered. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsiliu, Xinhuo, and Xinhua rose by half a percent, Zhongfa and Meyer rose to the limit, and Huafeng, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Jingfu slightly rose. The next-day delivery market only traded for half a day. Deyong Yarn and Meyer slightly declined, Xinhuo, Huafeng, and Xinguang fell by half a percent, Jingfu fell by slightly less than one percent. The unpopular stocks Tongyi, Zhongsiliu, Commerce, National Goods, Wuhe, Yonggong, Jiufu, and Xinya rose to the limit. The rest rose from slightly to no more than one percent. Outside the market, various stocks heard news of Nanyang's listing and rose sharply along with Zhonghua. The rest also saw higher prices.</p>
<h3>Securities Arbitrage: Wang Zhixin Explains</h3>
<p>Recently, the stock market has been rising, and all parties are extremely concerned. Wang Zhixin, acting concurrently as General Manager of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, made a statement, and his remarks regarding arbitrage are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>A securities arbitrage method is being tested. On the one hand, it facilitates those who hold surplus funds to buy spot goods and sell next-day deliveries at the same time in order to arbitrage interest without bearing the risk of market price fluctuations. On the other hand, it facilitates securities investors to release spot goods and buy next-day deliveries at the same time when they have an urgent need for funds in order to absorb idle funds. In addition to bearing the fixed interest rate, they also do not bear the risk of market price fluctuations. After the ban on trading in gold and foreign currency, those with small amounts of funds, who could originally buy gold jewelry and US dollars, cannot buy them and use them for arbitrage, which is most convenient. Therefore, if arbitrage is used properly, it can indeed absorb surplus funds, adjust short-term finance, and benefit the supply of funds to stabilize interest rates. Recently, market interest rates are still high, and interest arbitrage is between 7-8% and 25%. When finance is relaxed in the future and funds pour in, interest arbitrage will naturally decrease.</p>
<h3>Bullish Party Takes Profits, Bond Market Rally Slightly Weakens</h3>
<p>After rising yesterday, the government bond market fell back again. Outside institutions continue to absorb, but the bullish party took profits, and the transaction volume reached 10 million yuan. Type C bonds opened in the morning at a high price of 12,000 yuan to 12,600 yuan, once falling back to 10,900 yuan, and hovered at 11,600 yuan at noon. After the close, the price decreased and saw a low of 1,000 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Type A and B fell by 700 yuan, Type C was stable, Type D fell by 500 yuan, and Type E also fell by a small amount of 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Asian Steel Shows Well, Rubber is in Demand with Limited Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms absorbed the steel industry's Asian stocks, and both showed well. In the afternoon, with the help of Hua stocks, they continued to prosper. The asking price for rubber stocks remained high, with demand exceeding supply. As a result, He Dexun and Yeguang remained flat, the steel industry's rolling price rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Export Disappears, Yarn Market Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market's downward trend became stronger. Although yarn factories and construction companies did not allocate a large amount of yarn, those in the industry, in view of the disappearance of exports, intended to sell at all costs. Buyers shrank back, resulting in a one-sided situation. 10-count yarn fell another 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Light-weight Shuangma saw a low of 3.22 million yuan, only 20,000 yuan higher than the construction company's listed price, and still lacked buyers. 20-count Sanyang saw a low of 2.97 million yuan, with slight sales, averaging another drop of 50,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Demand Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were characterized by the abundance of supply of construction company chips for next-day delivery, while the demand from dyeing factories and door shops in this street weakened, resulting in a uniform decline in fine cloth, ranging from 1,000 yuan to 6,000-7,000 yuan. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was priced at 149,500 yuan, a decrease of 4,000 yuan, and Caiqiu was 144,000 yuan, a decrease of 7,500 yuan. Zhenzhong also fell by 7,500 yuan to 130,000 yuan. The demand for Shilin cloth also remained sluggish. 190 Meiting Shilin cloth was priced at 365,000 yuan, a decrease of 9,000 yuan. Chuji and Taohuanv both fell by 10,000 yuan to 350,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, which has reached the sales order, also saw a decrease in price of 3,000-4,000 yuan due to the lack of demand from door shops. The prices of other blue cloth and twill cloth were all sluggish. Only Fuchou saw a slight movement in sales, rising by 4,000-5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Businesses Recommend Daige to Participate in Export Promotion Group</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Representatives of various foreign trading companies in the city held a meeting in the second floor of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to formally nominate candidates to participate in the 17 small groups of the Export Promotion Council.

Therefore, the meeting location was chosen to be at Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn and Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong via Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Japanese yarn and cloth have invaded the Nanyang market and are gradually advancing. Recently, two batches have been shipped to Hong Kong via Shanghai and then transferred to various ports by ship. The Taikoo Company's Beihai vessel also carried 2,750 pieces of cotton yarn and 500 boxes of rayon from Kobe, Japan, and arrived at the port yesterday. It is scheduled to load a small amount of Singapore goods in Shanghai today before setting sail south. The yarn from Japan will be shipped to Yangon by the original ship, and the rayon will be unloaded in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Restriction Methods: Importers and Exporters Face Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's import and export and fur, grease, and bone trade associations jointly hosted the city's press yesterday to publicly express the current difficulties of these industries. Here are excerpts: (1) The Central Bank stipulates that the maximum period for exchange settlement for consignment exports is only 90 days, but at present, due to poor transportation, it takes more than two or three months for goods to reach Europe and the United States, leaving almost no time for the consignment period. Moreover, many export goods are subject to seasonal restrictions, which will result in foreign merchants taking the opportunity to cut prices. (2) The Central Bank stipulates that export goods shipped before November 7, 1946, must be settled for foreign exchange at the exchange rate before February 6, 1947, and cannot be settled at the current exchange rate. The profits that exporters should have obtained are completely deprived. (3) There is still no formal exchange rate in Siam, and it is settled through Hong Kong dollars. However, there is no formal parity between Siam and Hong Kong, so the time limit for exchange settlement is not permitted by the facts. (4) The Central Bank's regulations on the British exchange rate issued on February 28 of this year have a difference of 8,000 yuan, which is tantamount to剥削（depriving/exploiting） the interests of exporters, causing a loss of 20% on export goods that have been traded but not settled. (5) Exporters' commissions to foreign agents and the payment of all miscellaneous expenses cannot be remitted because the Central Bank often does not approve foreign exchange settlement, which affects the international commercial credit of exporters.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Siamese Rice Export Methods: Large Shipments of Siamese Rice Will Be Transported to Shanghai This Month</h3>
<p>The Siamese government has recently improved the rice purchase system, allowing the circulation of domestic grain. Those who transport Siamese rice out of the country will also receive 10% in free pounds. Therefore, Chinese rice merchants in Siam feel more convenient, and the amount of rice purchased has also increased as a result. It is reported that 15,700 tons of rice have been allocated to our country in March, which can be transported to Shanghai in the short term.</p>
<h3>Man-made Silk Asks for Lower Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rayon market saw a drop in prices after trading opened due to the continuation of the distribution and sales, with supply exceeding demand in the market. No. 120 Gaoshan initially asked for 6.9 million yuan, but no one paid attention. Soon, it retreated to 6.7 million yuan, and a few boxes were traded. The smallest interim price was 6 million. In the afternoon, due to the fact that there were many who wanted to sell, the minimum price was 550,000 yuan, but the asking price was too low, and holders were unwilling to sell, so the final asking price returned to 700,000 yuan. As a result, it fell by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The factory business situation was even quieter than the next day, and there was mostly no trading. Grade C yesterday called for a next-day trading price of 7.5 million yuan, and ordinary retail called for around 7.1-7.2 million yuan. The high-end five-dan cargo called for 6 million yuan, and the decision-makers were about 400,000 yuan. The same was true for silk goods, which were also quiet. There was no trading in quilt covers, and the asking price remained unchanged from the previous day. Dachengggebi wrinkle slightly traded, initially asking for 7,100-7,200 yuan, and finally trading for 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Qihong Trading is Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, in the foreign tea market, the momentum of Qimen black tea for the 35th year has continued to be quiet. Although there is demand in various parts of Britain, the prices are too high, so they still sigh at the tea. Old Chen's aged green tea, because it is not loved by foreign countries, the buying has subsided, and the process is very leisurely. As for the green tea in the 34th and 35th years, there is a craze for it, and it is still very popular. At this moment, Xiachang, Huacha, Dadechang, and other tea companies have all consulted with the holders, but the attitudes of supply and demand tend to persist, transactions are not prosperous, and the market is hovering consistently, lacking changes. Domestic sales of red and green tea are as stagnant as before, and people's hearts are lingering.</p>
<h3>Wool Sales Sluggish, Prices High, Huom Fourth Book Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wool market still showed a situation of sluggish sales and high prices. Sellers mostly regretted the difficulty of importing goods, while buyers felt it was difficult to sell out. Most general buyers felt that the prices were too expensive and were unable to add to production, so the market price standard has always hovered steadily. It is predicted that when the sales of the local gang can be advanced, the wool market will inevitably rise several levels again. The trend of Huom's Fourth Book has been very active in recent days. Large and small Western-style tailoring gangs have all added to their inquiries. Imported goods are far more suitable than local factory goods. Local factory goods are wholesaled for 35,000 yuan to more than 60,000 yuan per yard, and imported goods are wholesaled for 200,000 yuan for first-class, 160,000-170,000 yuan for second-class, and 100,000 yuan for third-class.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Sold at Original Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market tended to soften again because Taiwan Sugar Company's today's tender sales were allocated according to the eighth phase, with 30% for 24 coarse white at 190,000 yuan, 20% for four and a half military at 200,000 yuan, and 50% for Taiwan red at 140,000 yuan. The association's board price was 194,000 yuan for No. 22 medium sand white, with the decision price at 190,500 yuan, 194,000 yuan for three and a half-rate white, 188,000 yuan to 186,000 yuan and 185,500 yuan for the wharf, and 215,000 yuan for 24 group jiao. 140,000 yuan for the No. 9 phase of the Taiwan Red wharf. Shantou green was 130,000 yuan for the No. goods, and Shunde green was 129,000 yuan to 127,800 yuan. Superior ice flower white was 200,500 yuan, Xinghua white was 185,000 yuan to 183,400 yuan, and inferior red was 131,200 yuan to 131,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Adopts Subsidy Method to Handle Coal Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the National Economic Commission's Price Committee held its first decision-making meeting in Beijing. Regarding the handling of cotton yarn purchase prices, it was decided to seek a solution that takes into account the interests of manufacturers and does not stimulate market prices. Appropriate methods will also be sought to stabilize the yarn and cloth market and prevent prices from soaring. The issue of foreign cotton supply was also discussed. Furthermore, a subsidy method has been decided upon as a countermeasure for handling coal prices. It is said that all the resolutions have been submitted to Chairman Chiang by Weng Wenhao and Wang Yunwu. If approved, Wang will bring them to Shanghai for announcement.</p>
<p>[Another report] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu is scheduled to take the evening train to Shanghai today, and is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. It is reported that Wang will attend the regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee to be held on Friday, and the board meeting of the Textile Construction Company to be held on Saturday. The board meeting of the Textile Construction Company will discuss how to return the company to private management and the methods for issuing stocks.</p>
<h3>Paper Mills in This City Have a Monthly Output of Approximately 5,000 Tons; Business Was Slack Last Year Due to the Impact of Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a survey by the Paper Manufacturing Industry Association of this city, there are 22 paper mills in this city that are purely privately owned. Among them, Tianjun, Da Zhonghua, Minji, Huafeng, and Huasheng are the largest in scale. Haijing and Huaan are both in a state of suspension. In addition, there are also the Dalu Paper Mill (already demolished), Xingye, Liyong, Huali, Haifeng, and Datong (not included in the 22), all of which are in a state of suspension. The reason for the poor business performance of various factories last year was due to the dumping of foreign goods and the improper procurement of raw materials. The factories that are in operation mainly produce wrapping paper and domestic products similar to foreign products, so the sales are still good, as these types of paper are not affected by foreign goods. As for enemy and puppet properties, since September of the 34th year [1945], the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces, and the Paper Industry Rehabilitation Committee, took over 14 large and small paper mills. Among them, except for some machines that are incomplete or lacking raw materials and cannot be started, the larger ones, such as Da Zhonghua, Sakurai, Jin Xing East Factory and West Factory, and Jiangnan Factory 1 and Factory 2, have all started operation. Currently, Da Zhonghua and Tianzhang have been returned to private management. New East Asia has been leased out. Shanghai Processing Paper Factory, Shanghai Paperware Co., Ltd., and Jiangnan Paper Factory No. 2 have all been sold. The other factories are still being processed.</p>
<p>The types of products produced by each factory are constantly changing according to the needs of the market. Approximately, there are cigarette paper, various paper boards, wrapping paper, rough-edged paper, kraft paper, poster paper, woodfree paper, newsprint, colored paper, cover paper, three-ding paper, typing paper, match paper, etc. The daily output ranges from a minimum of one ton to a maximum of more than thirty tons, with an average of five tons. The maximum total output of various papers by private factories is 9,281 tons, and that of state-owned factories is 540 tons. The maximum total monthly output of national and private factories is 9,721 tons, but the actual output is estimated at half of that, approximately 5,000 tons.</p>
<p>Based on a monthly paper production of 10,000 tons, the required raw materials are estimated as follows: 5,550 tons of wood pulp, 4,000 tons of waste cloth, 1,500 tons of bean stalk pulp, 1,500 tons of waste paper, 380 tons of caustic soda, 250 tons of rosin, 700 tons of alum, 600 tons of bleaching powder, 500 tons of elm wood, 25,700 tons of coal, 15 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, 38,000 pounds of blankets, and 20,000 square feet of copper wire mesh. Among the above raw materials and materials, wood pulp, blankets, and copper wire mesh need to be imported. It is reported that there are wood pulp factories in Northeast China and Taiwan that are urgently preparing to resume production to meet domestic needs.</p>
<h3>The Downturn of Dyes is Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The sluggishness of the dye market and the low actual sales in the past two weeks are unprecedented in the past year. Buyers dare not absorb stock, and sellers are vying to sell. Moreover, actual sales in this city are also scarce, and merchants from other regions are hesitant to move forward due to the increasingly deteriorating transportation situation. In addition, the prices in the inland areas are mostly lower than those in the Shanghai market, so until recently, the dye market has had no support to speak of, and prices are falling every day. According to people in the industry, the low sales to other regions are indeed one of the reasons for the price decline, but the accumulation of stock by retail buyers is also one of the main reasons. Last year, there was a shortage of dyes, and people competed to hoard them. When prices softened, the hoarders competed to release their stocks, so normal businesses were instead in a passive position. Yesterday, the price of Samsung Gray was 320,000 to 350,000 yuan per can, 693 [illegible] yuan, 6 million yuan per dan, No. 16 Di Zi Gray was 350,000 yuan per catty, B.N.C. Yuanqing was 90,000 yuan per catty, and San Ge Soap Yellow was 210,000 yuan per can. There were slight transactions, but no one asked about the rest.</p>
<h3>Goods Tax on Wool Textiles Changed to Tax on Wool Yarn</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Wool Textile Industry Association previously decided to send representatives to Beijing to personally present to the relevant ministries and commissions the various difficulties of the industry regarding the goods tax issue, proposing to change the tax to wool yarn and to reduce the tax rate. It is now reported that the proposal to tax yarn has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan and was approved at the general meeting on the 11th of this month. The tax rate remains the same and will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bristles Stand Out Abroad; Transactions in This City are Sparse</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to pig bristle exporters, the market price of Shanghai bristles in New York is US$2.10 per pound, Sichuan bristles are US$2.60, and Hankou bristles are US$3.50. Because the government is selling pre-war bristles, except for the relatively high number of transactions in Shanghai bristles, the other pig bristles in Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, etc., are all showing signs of fatigue. In this city, transactions are also mostly in Shanghai bristles, and no one is asking about Sichuan and Hankou bristles. Yesterday, the market price of local Shanghai bristles was 3 million yuan per sima dan, Hankou bristles were 5 million yuan, Sichuan bristles were 3.9 million yuan, Hankou black bristles paired with chests were 5 million yuan per Zhejiang-Ningbo dan, and Chongqing black pig bristles paired with chests were 2.48 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Leather Market is Weak</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In the past two weeks, the leather market has plummeted. Raw cowhide has fallen from 350,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan per dan, large raw yellow cowhide has fallen from 800,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan per dan, medium boards have fallen from 1 million yuan to 800,000 yuan, and small boards have fallen from 1.6 million yuan to 1.2 million yuan. Tree-patterned leather has fallen from 60,000 yuan to 36,000 yuan per foot.</p>
<h3>Measures for Adjusting Capital of Industrial and Mining Enterprises (Continued Conclusion) Supplementary Calculation Methods to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>5. If the depreciation period stipulated by the Income Tax Law for various fixed assets has expired, but they are still in actual use, the residual value of the assets, that is, one-tenth of their original price, may be calculated according to the specified multiple as the maximum limit for their re-evaluated price.</p>
<p>If the actual usage period of the aforementioned fixed assets that have exceeded the depreciation period is reliably estimated to be more than three years, their residual value may be appropriately increased, but it shall not exceed two-tenths of their original price at most.</p>
<p>If the original price and service life of various fixed assets are unknown, their value shall not be re-evaluated according to these measures. If there are legitimate reasons for the ambiguity, the reasons may be stated (and relevant documents, if any, should also be attached) and submitted to the competent authority for approval, and the following paragraphs shall be followed:</p>
<p>(1) If the original price is verifiable but the service life is unknown, it shall be deemed to have exceeded the prescribed depreciation period and valued in accordance with the preceding paragraph.</p>
<p>(2) If the original price is unknown but the service life is verifiable, the value of the asset may be estimated, and the new replacement value in December of the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936] shall be deducted. The depreciation that should be provided during its service life shall be deducted, and one-half of the remaining price shall be the maximum limit for its re-evaluated price.</p>
<p>(3) If both the original price and the service life are unknown, the new replacement value of the asset in December of the 35th year of the Republic of China [1946] may be estimated, its residual value calculated in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, and then halved to be the maximum limit for its re-evaluated price.</p>
<p>The estimation of the new replacement value in the preceding paragraph shall be done by a specialized technician entrusted by the court.</p>

<h3>A Grand Gathering on the Shores of West Lake: A Joint Celebration of Chinese, British, and American Flying Generals</h3>
<p>— Hangzhou, 9th Fast News - Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>On March 7th, a C-47 military plane came from the northeast direction in the clear blue sky of Hangzhou and slowly landed at the airport of the Jianqiao Air Force School. When the door opened, a plump Englishman with thick, dark, and loose hair stood smiling at the door. He was British Air Force Lieutenant General Sir E.A. Baldwin, accompanied by Mr. Charles North of the British Ministry of Civil Aviation and Major General Lin Weicheng of our Air Force. General Hu Weike, the Director of Education of the Air Force Officer School, received them and showed them around our Air Force School, and they also toured the scenic spots of West Lake.</p>
<p>In the evening, a banquet was held at Lou Wai Lou on the banks of West Lake to welcome them and to talk about the customs and culture of Hangzhou. Those invited to the banquet included Mr. Shen Honglie, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Mr. Lei Fajun, Secretary-General, Mr. Zhou Xiangxian, Mayor of Hangzhou, Mr. Wen, American Civil Advisor of the Air Force, Mr. Zhu Shushou, Director of the Political Department of the Air Force Officer School, Directors Zhang and Yang of the Air Force, Mrs. Cunningham, American Chief Advisor of the Air Force, Mrs. Zhang and Yang, Aide-de-Camp Li Chengyuan of the Air Force, and about two people from the press, including Ms. Liu Xiangnu. The host, Mr. and Mrs. Hu Weike, were busy introducing the guests by name. Afterwards, we sat around eating watermelon seeds.</p>
<p>Sir Baldwin is a person who has made outstanding achievements in World War II. In the spring of 1942, he planned and led 1,200 British aircraft to bomb Cologne, a major town on the Rhine River. This opened a new chapter in the history of large-scale air force bombing. In his conversations, he humbly avoided talking about his military exploits and always spoke and smiled with a peculiar British demeanor.</p>
<p>A Feast Opens with Spirited Drinking Games</p>
<p>The feast opened grandly. Sir Baldwin and Mr. Ross were both good at drinking, especially Mr. Ross. In addition to enjoying drinking, he also liked to play finger-guessing games. I, who was assigned to sit next to him, was his only opponent. After he lost twice, he said, "Let's gamble on luck," and tried again. Mrs. Cunningham also targeted the reporter as her opponent. She accepted the advice of Mayor Zhou, so she won every battle, but every time she won, she would raise her glass and drink it all down. Mr. Wen was also good at drinking. Later, Chairman Shen also drank a few glasses, and the host and hostess diligently offered drinks one by one, making everyone at the party feel extremely happy and excited.</p>
<p>A Thumbs-Up for the Air Force</p>
<p>As the drinking enthusiasm waned, we returned to drinking tea and chatting. I asked Sir Baldwin, "What do you think of our Chinese-trained air force?" He raised his thumb and said, "Very good!" He then said, "Director Hu is an old friend of mine who trained the air force in India. I have worked closely with him. I think that in such a difficult time in China, the air force education is still overcoming material difficulties and continuing to move forward. This is commendable. For example, I personally saw the Stearman training planes that departed from India flying over the Hump. I didn't expect them to still be in use now. This is really an example of creating something out of hardship. Also, as I saw in the Chinese air force camps in India, trees were planted everywhere. Now, trees are also planted everywhere in the Air Force School. This is Mr. Hu's consistent style, and we are worthy of praise."</p>
<p>Hu Weike Says He Was Inspired</p>
<p>Mr. Wen, who was listening from the side, also interjected, "I personally saw this other style of training the air force, which made us feel immensely gratified." Mr. Ross said with a smile, "Very good!" Mrs. Cunningham also said, "We are very happy to be influenced by this in the Chinese air force camps we are training in." Lin Weicheng humbly said, "We still rely on everyone's help." Mr. Hu Weike was a little embarrassed and said, "All of this is inspired by the principal!"</p>
<p>China and Britain Sign Civil Aviation Agreement</p>
<p>Baldwin then talked eloquently about his mission. Because he has many good Chinese friends, he loves China. This time, China and Britain are going to sign a civil aviation agreement, and he was assigned as the head of the delegation. He was happy to accept this task. He had met with our authorities in Nanjing, and now he was going to various places to investigate. He had been to Shanghai, and now he was in Hangzhou. The next morning, he would fly back to Shanghai, then to Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places, and then fly back to Nanjing before signing the aviation agreement. He said that he loved Hangzhou very much. Hangzhou is like Switzerland, although the area is not large, but the whole city is very clean. He also said that a place like Hangzhou could be built into an ideal cultural city. Because he loved Hangzhou, we welcomed him to come again. He said, "When I finish my business, I will try to come again."</p>
<p>Friendly Relations and Great Cooperation</p>
<p>This banquet was truly a grand celebration of a part of the air force generals of China, Britain, and the United States. Everyone talked very happily. Everyone felt that the friendly relations between China, Britain, and the United States should be more cordial and that closer cooperation was needed, and that close cooperation should be carried out under the principles of equality and mutual benefit.</p>
<p>The night was already deep, but the guests were still reluctant to leave. Only the sound of the boatmen on the lake shore calling out "It's time to go home" awakened this group of guests. They tidied their clothes, wished each other well, and parted.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Decides to Levy Income Tax</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong, News on the [day not specified] - Our Special Correspondent Zi Jian</p>
<p>In recent days, amidst the voice of changing the Governor of Hong Kong, a wave has occurred in society, with everyone from salaried employees to the wealthy being swept into this wave. The origin of this wave is the Hong Kong government's decision to levy income tax. This major decision has been brewing for almost a year.</p>
<p>Tax Department Actively Preparing</p>
<p>Since the Hong Kong government announced at the end of July last year that the financial year from 1946 to March 31, 1947, would have expenditures of over 160 million and income of only over 50 million, the Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong government announced that the Hong Kong government was considering continuing to levy the war tax or income tax implemented in 1941. At that time, it caused an uproar among people in Hong Kong, regardless of Chinese or Western. This "consideration" was silent for half a year. Last month, Hong Kong government agencies suddenly revealed that they would implement income tax collection on April 1. Mr. Peter Dale, the Income Tax Commissioner of the Hong Kong government, who had been immersed in research in Britain for more than a year and was assigned by the British Colonial Office, came to Hong Kong without a sound at that time and began to prepare his Tax Department (Inland Revenue Department).</p>
<p>In order to make up for the financial deficit of over 100 million and reduce the burden on British taxpayers on Hong Kong, levying income tax is inevitable. However, Hong Kong and Chinese residents, in order to maintain their "hand-to-mouth" lives, are also difficult to succumb to. They may know that there is nothing they can do to prevent the Hong Kong government from implementing this "economic emergency measure plan," but they cannot help but express their views and show the public's reaction to the government.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreigners Alike Express Panic</p>
<p>"I would rather run into Stanley Prison than pay income tax!" This is a very humorous sentence, and the speaker is certainly not a Chinese businessman. Another young British gentleman also said: "Because of the extreme shortage of housing, I have no choice but to live in a hotel with my wife for a long time. We have just overcome the difficulties because the company recently added some salary to me, and also added some living allowances to compensate for my deficiencies. But now the government is going to take away part of my income again, wouldn't that make me retreat into a dead end again? The salary increase and allowances I am getting now are all empty, because the cost of the hotel is shockingly high, but this is the only place I can find to live."</p>
<p>The opinions of our overseas Chinese are: "Most of the formal businessmen in Hong Kong after the war, engaged in legitimate business, can only maintain their facade and have no actual profit. The losses during the war cannot be compensated, unlike those with abundant floating capital who use floating capital to manipulate the market and obtain huge profits. When the government levies income tax, only formal businessmen pay, while the wealthy and those with floating capital will be able to avoid it. It is really extremely unfair." Some say: "The current business situation is sluggish, even worse than last year. It is not the time to levy income tax and business tax." Some say: "The most severely hit by the levying of income tax are the middle-income salaried class. The poor class is not a problem, while the wealthy class, such as the nouveau riche who have recently come to Hong Kong from Shanghai, will always find a way to get by because it is mostly difficult to find out what kind of income they have."</p>
<p>The reaction of the overseas Chinese to the Hong Kong government's levying of income tax does not seem as intense as that of foreigners. They do not express opposition, but believe that life is difficult after the war, and that it is not the time to levy taxes, or point out that it is unfair. "People have an obligation to pay taxes." It seems that our overseas Chinese "understand" this principle more than the British!</p>
<p>The Focus Is Not on the Wealthy</p>
<p>The reason why the Hong Kong government's levying of income tax has aroused strong opposition from residents is that, according to the disclosure of the Tax Commissioner, anyone with an annual salary of more than 5,000 yuan will pay at least 14% tax! An annual salary of 5,000 yuan, or a monthly income of 400 yuan, is only enough to support a family of five in today's Hong Kong. This is the minimum expenditure for a middle-class family. If 14% is deducted again, they simply cannot live! A worker with a monthly income of two or three hundred yuan, without the burden of a family, lives a more carefree life than a manager with a monthly income of one thousand yuan! Therefore, unless the Hong Kong government raises the lower limit of income tax collection to a considerable amount, such as 50,000 yuan or 100,000 yuan, and focuses on the wealthy, it will inevitably lead to more corruption and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Income Tax is the First Step of the War Tax</p>
<p>The "war tax" implemented in 1941 is divided into: (1) Property tax - 14% levied according to land price or house price; (2) Salary tax - 6% levied on an annual income of 5,000 yuan, and 14% levied on income above 5,000 yuan; (3) Profit tax - 7% levied on annual profits of 50,000 yuan, and 14% levied on profits above 50,000 yuan; (4) Interest tax - 10% levied. This "war tax" arose because of raising war expenses, but peace has prevailed for years, and the regulations of this "war tax" have not been formally abolished. Therefore, some social celebrities believe that the Hong Kong government's levying of income tax will be the first step in restoring the levying of the "war tax." The other three types of war tax will surely continue to be implemented.</p>
<p>Before deciding to levy income tax, the Hong Kong government has already begun to increase other taxes in order to maintain budget balance, such as water fees, port usage taxes, pilotage fees, lighthouse fees, and ship berthing fees, all of which are higher than before the war. In addition, stamp duty and tobacco tax were restored, and food and beverage tax (10% levied on each guest of more than 5 yuan) and dance tax were levied. The direct and indirect burdens on residents in Hong Kong are not small. Now, some people suggest that the Hong Kong government levy luxury tax, issue lottery tickets or government bonds, in lieu of levying income tax. Some people are trembling with fear, wondering if there will be a day when a "head tax" will be levied?</p>
<h3>Under the Five-Yuan System: The Administrative Organ of Judicial Administration - Supreme Court Presiding Judges and Judges</h3>
<p>Introduction: Since the implementation of the Five-Yuan system, the administrative organ for judicial administration has repeatedly faced issues, and there have been constant changes in the legal system. Now that the Constitution has been promulgated, which Yuan will administer judicial administration has not been clearly defined, leading to two different interpretations. It is heard that the draft organization laws for the Administrative and Judicial Yuans, submitted by the National Defense Supreme Council to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, adopt the view that the Administrative Yuan should administer it. Does this truly align with the fundamental purpose of the Constitution? This article briefly narrates the evolution of the legal system since the implementation of the Five-Yuan system, discusses its merits and demerits, and conducts a study on the administrative organ for judicial administration under the Constitution.</p>
<p>Evolution of the Five-Yuan System's Legal System</p>
<p>The implementation of the Five-Yuan system began with the promulgation of the National Government Organization Law on October 3, 1928. Article 33 of the same law stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government, administering judicial trial, judicial administration, the discipline of officials, and administrative trial." The Judicial Organization Law was promulgated on October 20 of the same month, and according to its Article 1, a Judicial Administration Department was established as a component of the Judicial Yuan. The Judicial Yuan Organization Law was amended on November 17 of the same year, renaming the Judicial Administration Department as the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Article 37 of the amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on June 15, 1931, stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government, administering judicial trial." Whether judicial administration was entirely administered by the Judicial Yuan was not clearly defined. However, during the period of its implementation, the Ministry of Judicial Administration remained subordinate to the Judicial Yuan. Subsequently, Article 24, Paragraph 5 of the amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on December 30, 1931, stipulated: "The appointment and removal of administrative and judicial officials above the recommended rank shall be decided by the Executive Yuan Council." Article 35, Paragraph 1 stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest trial organ of the National Government." Article 36 stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan has the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries." Consequently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. The amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on February 17, 1934, amended Article 24, Paragraph 5 to: "The appointment and removal of administrative officials above the recommended rank shall be decided by the Executive Yuan Council." Article 35 was amended to: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government." Article 36 was amended to: "The Judicial Yuan has the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries." Thus, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was once again subordinate to the Judicial Yuan. The amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on December 12, 1942, added the two characters for "judicial" to Article 24, Paragraph 5, and deleted the five characters for "Ministry of Judicial Administration" from Article 36, reverting to the original text promulgated on December 30, 1931. The Ministry of Judicial Administration was then again transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, which is the current system. However, regarding judicial administration of the trial organs, what the Ministry of Judicial Administration administers is only the part concerning the High Courts and District Courts. All judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries, even during the period when the Ministry of Judicial Administration was subordinate to the Executive Yuan, was still administered by the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>The Mistake of Division of Authority Between the Two Yuans</p>
<p>The Five-Yuan system was invented by the Founding Father of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. The Outline of National Reconstruction, personally drafted by him, lists the various departments of the Executive Yuan without any mention of a Ministry of Justice or a Ministry of Judicial Administration. Citing the establishment of the Dali Yuan in Guangdong by the Founding Father, all judicial administration currently administered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration was administered by that court. This shows that it was the Founding Father's original intention that judicial administration should not be administered by the Executive Yuan. The omission of a Ministry of Justice or a Ministry of Judicial Administration in the list of the Executive Yuan's departments in the Outline of National Reconstruction was not an oversight. However, since the implementation of the Five-Yuan system, the National Government Organization Law has been amended twice, transferring the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which was subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. The reason for this is quite puzzling. Some say: "The Judicial Yuan establishes a department to administer judicial administration, naming it the Ministry of Judicial Administration. People see the name of the department and realize that it clearly has the characters for 'administration,' so they advocate changing it to be subordinate to the Executive Yuan. If the Judicial Yuan did not specifically establish this department and directly administered the matters within the scope of the department's authority, or even if it did specifically establish the department but named it the Ministry of Legal Affairs, without revealing the characters for 'administration,' then the Ministry of Judicial Administration would certainly not be subordinate to the Executive Yuan." Ordinary people may inevitably have this notion, but we believe that those who advocated for the change in subordination must have had other reasons. However, we have no way of knowing those reasons. There is no need to explore this reason. Let's discuss its merits and demerits. After the Ministry of Judicial Administration was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan still administered a portion of judicial administration, as mentioned above. Since the highest judicial administration organs were divided into two, judicial administration could not be unified as a result. This mistake has approximately five points: First, government orders inevitably conflict, undermining the credibility of the government. For example, according to Article 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the travel time to be deducted when calculating the statutory period is determined by the highest judicial administration organ. The travel time to the District Court or the High Court should indeed be determined by the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The travel time to the Supreme Court (refer to Article 34, Paragraph 2, Article 233, Paragraph 2, Article 496, Paragraph 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure) should still be determined by the Judicial Yuan. This is because the Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial administration organ for the Supreme Court, and the travel time to the Supreme Court cannot be determined by the Executive Yuan or judicial administration on its behalf. This is evident from the fact that the highest judicial administration organ mentioned in Article 463, Paragraph 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure has always been interpreted as referring to the Judicial Yuan without any doubt. If the travel time from a certain place to the capital's High Court determined by the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration is different from the travel time from that place to the Supreme Court determined by the Judicial Yuan, it will inevitably undermine the credibility of the government. Article 88 of the Court Organization Law states: "Those who have supervisory power according to the preceding article may issue orders to the supervised personnel regarding matters of their duties to make them pay attention." If, regarding the same type of matter, the President of the Judicial Yuan issues such orders to the judges of the Supreme Court, and the Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration issues such orders to the judges of the High Court, it goes without saying that it will undermine the credibility of the government. Second, it is not easy to maintain contact between the Supreme Court and lower courts in handling affairs, hindering work efficiency. Article 56 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "The internal regulations of courts and branches at all levels and the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office shall be determined by order." The Judicial Yuan is in charge of determining the internal regulations of the Supreme Court, and the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Judicial Administration is in charge of determining the internal regulations of the lower courts. It is not easy to maintain contact between the Supreme Court and lower courts in handling affairs, hindering work efficiency. If the President of the Judicial Yuan and the Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration have different views on the exercise of supervisory power, it will be even more difficult to maintain contact. Third, the same affairs are handled separately by two organs, resulting in a waste of manpower and resources. For example, the amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure and the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1945, the supplementary regulations for handling civil and criminal lawsuits after repatriation, and the regulations for handling civil and criminal cases received by Taiwanese courts were all instances where the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Judicial Administration each submitted draft laws to the Legislative Yuan as their respective competent matters. Fourth, it is difficult to be prompt when one type of matter is handled jointly by two organs. For example, Item D of the Amnesty and Commutation Order for Criminals promulgated on New Year's Day in 1947 stipulates: "The detailed measures for commutation shall be determined jointly by the Judicial Yuan and the Executive Yuan." Before these measures were formulated and promulgated, all criminal cases that should have been commuted could not be handled. However, they were only formulated and promulgated as late as February 19 because the back-and-forth consultations between the two Yuans took a lot of time. And after the Executive Yuan received the draft plan determined by the Judicial Yuan, it must order it to be submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for review and reply, which further delayed the process. If judicial administration had not lost its unity, these measures would have been promulgated long ago. There are many other examples of matters that must be handled jointly due to the lack of unity in judicial administration. For example, Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Attorney Law stipulates: "The measures for attorney review shall be determined jointly by the Examination Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Executive Yuan." Fifth, the review of qualifications and the evaluation of judicial officials' performance cannot be linked. The Supreme Court is the court of final instance, and most of the cases that have been tried by the High Court are appealed to the Supreme Court. Whether the judges of the High Court and the District Court handle cases properly and quickly is best known to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court truly evaluates, records and reviews each case during trial, so that the judicial administration officials have a basis for punishing and rewarding judicial officials, it will definitely be beneficial to improving efficiency and reforming the judiciary. Now, because the Ministry of Judicial Administration is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, the trial cases of the Supreme Court and the evaluation of the performance of judicial officials by the Ministry of Judicial Administration cannot be linked, which is a pity. From this point of view, it is not a good policy in terms of legislative theory for judicial administration to be administered separately by the Executive and Judicial Yuans.</p>
<p>Review of the Administering Organ</p>
<p>Article 77 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the State, administering the trial of civil, criminal, and administrative lawsuits, and the discipline of public functionaries." Article 78 stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan interprets the Constitution and has the power to unify the interpretation of laws and orders." Although there is no explicit statement that judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan, it is naturally understood in interpretation that judicial administration is entirely administered by the Judicial Yuan. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Article 63 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Legislative Yuan has the power to resolve legal bills, budget bills, martial law bills, amnesty bills, war declaration bills, peace treaty bills, treaty bills, and other important matters of the State." Although the administration of legislation has not been explicitly stated to have the power to administer, the Legislative Yuan also has various administrative matters, such as matters concerning the receipt, dispatch, and safekeeping of documents, matters concerning the allocation, drafting, and compilation of documents, matters concerning meeting records, matters concerning the appointment, removal, and supervision of staff, matters concerning the safekeeping of seals, and matters concerning general affairs, all of which relate to the administration of legislation. If these administrative matters cannot be administered by the Legislative Yuan, the legislative power will not be able to be exercised properly. Article 83 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Examination Yuan is the highest examination organ of the State, administering matters such as examinations, appointments, qualifications, performance evaluations, etc." Although the administration of examinations has not been explicitly stated to have the power to administer, looking at the matters listed in the current Examination Yuan Organization Law regarding the functions of the Secretariat and the Counselor's Office, all of them relate to the administration of examinations. Moreover, according to the current regulations on the organization of the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Personnel may establish offices in various provinces to handle the qualification matters of commissioned public functionaries in those provinces. Matters concerning the establishment of the offices of the Ministry of Personnel and the appointment, removal, and supervision of their staff also relate to the exercise of examinations. After the implementation of the Constitution, it can be asserted that these administrative matters must be administered by the Examination Yuan. Article 90 of the Constitution stipulates: “The Control Yuan is the highest control organ of the State, exercising the powers of consent, impeachment, censure, and audit.” Regarding the administration of control, such as the functions of the Secretariat and Counselors listed in the current Control Yuan Organization Law, and matters concerning the establishment of control offices in various regions and the appointment, removal, and supervision of their staff, it has not been explicitly stated that they have the power to administer, but after the implementation of the Constitution, it will undoubtedly be administered by the Control Yuan. Therefore, the Constitution's provisions on the powers of the five Yuans are merely listing their exclusive, competent affairs. In order for the five Yuans to properly handle the exclusive, competent affairs within their powers without any obstruction, they should naturally administer the necessary administrative affairs related to them, without the need for explicit provisions. The Executive Yuan also has this type of administrative affair, so the administration administered by the Executive Yuan is divided into two types: The first type of administration, such as foreign affairs, national defense, education, and transportation, is its exclusive, competent affair, which is opposed to legislation, judiciary, examination, and control. The second type of administration, such as the appointment, removal, and supervision of subordinate staff, is the necessary administrative affair for properly handling its exclusive, competent affairs. This is the administration of administration (because its exclusive, competent affairs are also called administration, if it is simply called administration, the meaning of administration may not be clear), which is opposed to legislative administration, judicial administration, examination administration, and control administration. The administration referred to in Article 53 of the Constitution only refers to the first type of administration, and the second type of administration should be interpreted as naturally administered by the Executive Yuan, and does not include legislative administration, judicial administration, examination administration, or control administration. The reason why the Constitution did not explicitly stipulate that judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan, as in Article 76 of the May 5th Draft Constitution, is to maintain the consistency of its legislative style, and it was not appropriate to treat judicial administration differently, not because it was believed that judicial administration should be administered by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Article 79, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have a President and a Vice President, each one person." However, the matters stipulated in Articles 77 and 78 to be administered by the Judicial Yuan do not fall under the duties of the President and Vice President. Article 3 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "Trials in District Courts shall be conducted by one judge acting alone." "Trials in High Courts shall be conducted by a collegial panel of three judges." "Trials in the Supreme Court shall be conducted by a collegial panel of five or three judges." Therefore, the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits is not the duty of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Administrative Court Organization Law stipulates: "The trial of the Administrative Court shall be conducted by a collegial panel of five judges." Therefore, the trial of administrative lawsuits is not the duty of the President of the Judicial Yuan. Article 7 of the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries Organization Law stipulates: "The deliberation of disciplinary cases by the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries shall have the attendance of five or more members." Therefore, the discipline of public functionaries is not the duty of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Article 79, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have several Grand Justices to administer the matters stipulated in Article 78 of this Constitution." Therefore, the interpretation of the Constitution and the unification of the interpretation of laws and orders are not the duties of the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Moreover, Article 80 of the Constitution stipulates: "Judges shall conduct independent trials based on the law, free from any interference, outside of party affiliations." Therefore, the President of the Judicial Yuan not only has no trial duties, but also may not interfere with the independent trials of judges. So, what is the purpose of establishing the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan? The matters of the President of the Judicial Yuan explicitly stipulated in the Constitution are no more than two points: Article 44 stipulates: "The President, for disputes between the Yuans, in addition to those prescribed in this Constitution, may convene a meeting of the Presidents of the Yuans concerned to resolve them." Article 115 stipulates: "If a certain article of the Provincial Autonomy Law encounters significant obstacles during its implementation, after the Judicial Yuan convenes the relevant parties to present their opinions, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the President of the Legislative Yuan, the President of the Examination Yuan, and the President of the Control Yuan shall form a committee with the President of the Judicial Yuan as chairman to propose a solution." Is the establishment of the President of the Judicial Yuan for this purpose? However, these are not frequent matters. If the Judicial Yuan did not establish a President, these matters could be handled by the Chief Justice. Why is a President specifically established in the Judicial Yuan for this? The establishment of the President of the Judicial Yuan must have its regular duties. Article 3 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law stipulates: "The Grand Justices Conference of the Judicial Yuan shall be composed of eleven Grand Justices. The President and Vice President are ex officio Grand Justices and are included in the aforementioned number. The Grand Justices Conference shall be chaired by the President and shall exercise the power to interpret the Constitution and unify the interpretation of laws and orders." However, it is doubtful whether this is in line with the fundamental purpose of the Constitution. If the fundamental purpose of the Constitution were like this, it would necessarily follow the examples of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan being elected by the members of the Legislative Yuan, and the President and Vice President of the Control Yuan being elected by the members of the Control Yuan (refer to Articles 66 and 92 of the Constitution), and stipulate that the Judicial Yuan shall have a President and a Vice President, each one person, appointed by the President from among the Grand Justices. Why is it that in addition to stipulating the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, it is separately stipulated that there shall be several Grand Justices? Moreover, Article 11 of the same draft law stipulates: "The term of office of the President and Vice President shall be six years." While this is not objectionable, Article 81 of the Constitution stipulates: "Judges shall hold office for life." Since the President and Vice President should have a fixed term of office, and it is stipulated that they are ex officio Grand Justices, it is even more contradictory. Therefore, it is clear that the Constitution stipulates that the Judicial Yuan shall have a President and a Vice President, each one person, and their regular duties must be to manage judicial administration, not to make them ex officio Grand Justices.</p>
<p>(3) Article 37 of the amended National Government Organization Law promulgated on June 15, 1931, stipulated: "The Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the National Government, administering judicial trial." It did not explicitly state which Yuan administered judicial administration. Although the wording of this is not exactly the same as that of Article 77 of the Constitution, there is no difference in substance. Before the promulgation of the amended National Government Organization Law on December 30, 1931, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was still subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, and was not affected by the fact that it did not explicitly state that judicial administration was administered by the Judicial Yuan. Therefore, the provisions of Article 77 of the Constitution regarding the Judicial Yuan's trial power do not hinder the President of the Judicial Yuan from administering all judicial administration, and there is evidence of its exercise. Article 1 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "The courts shall try civil and criminal lawsuits and administer non-litigation events according to the jurisdiction stipulated by law." The so-called administration of non-litigation events according to law does not include judicial administration. This can be clearly understood by looking at the provisions of Article 10 of the Judicial Law, which stipulate that non-litigation events are only under the jurisdiction of the District Court. Trying civil and criminal lawsuits and administering non-litigation events are the exclusive powers of the judges, and are not the powers of the President of the court. However, Articles 11, 18, and 23 of the same law stipulate that each level of court shall have a President, who shall manage all the administrative affairs of the court. This does not conflict with the provisions of Article 1, because the court must be able to administer the necessary administrative affairs related to it in order to properly exercise its trial power without any obstruction, without the need for specific provisions in Article 1. The relationship between Article 77 and Article 79, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution is actually no different from the relationship between Article 1 and Articles 11, 18, and 23 of the Court Organization Law. One cannot say that because Article 77 of the Constitution stipulates that the power of trial belongs to the Judicial Yuan, the President of the Judicial Yuan has no power to administer judicial administration.</p>
<p>(4) The Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries are trial organs. However, Article 23 of the Court Organization Law stipulates: "The Supreme Court shall have a President, appointed by special appointment, to manage all the administrative affairs of the court." Article 2 of the Administrative Court Organization Law stipulates: "The Administrative Court shall have a President to manage all the administrative affairs of the court." Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries Organization Law stipulates: "The Chairman of the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries shall manage the affairs of the Commission, supervise the subordinate staff, and may investigate the progress of disciplinary cases, but may not interfere with the discipline." Therefore, the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries all have administrative affairs related to trial. These administrative affairs, i.e., judicial administration, are administered by the President or Chairman, and the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries are organs subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, and their administrative affairs are supervised by the President of the Judicial Yuan. Some administrative affairs, such as the appointment and removal of staff above the recommended rank, must also be submitted to the President of the Judicial Yuan for approval. This was the case even during the period when the Ministry of Judicial Administration was subordinate to the Executive Yuan. Article 4 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have the following organs: (1) The Supreme Court, (2) The Administrative Court, (3) The Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries." Article 10, Paragraph 1 stipulates: "The President shall manage the affairs of the Yuan and supervise the administrative affairs of the subordinate organs." Therefore, it is planned to be the same after the implementation of the Constitution. However, those who adopt the view that judicial administration should be administered by the Executive Yuan are merely transferring the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. All judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries still cannot but be administered by the Judicial Yuan. The subordination of the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries to the Judicial Yuan is no different in nature from the subordination of the High Courts and District Courts to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Since the nature of judicial administration is administrative, the High Courts and District Courts are subordinate to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the Executive Yuan, then the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries must also be subordinate to the Executive Yuan in order for the argument to be consistently applied. Not only that, but the Grand Justices interpret the Constitution and exercise the power to unify the interpretation of laws and orders, which is the exercise of judicial power. However, the repair of the office buildings of the Grand Justices, the payment of the salaries of the Grand Justices, the receipt, allocation, and safekeeping of documents requesting interpretation, and the sealing and issuing of answer documents are all judicial administrative affairs. Therefore, the Grand Justices must also be made subordinate to the Executive Yuan in order for the argument that judicial administration should be administered by the Executive Yuan to be consistently applied. Now, only the High Courts and District Courts are made subordinate to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the Executive Yuan, which is only reducing the amount of judicial administration that the Judicial Yuan should not administer, and transferring all the judicial administration that the Judicial Yuan should not administer to the Executive Yuan. If this is the case, and my argument has been consistently applied, how is it different from laughing at someone for fleeing fifty steps when you have fled a hundred steps? Since it is impossible to transfer all judicial administration to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, why can't the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts still be administered by the Judicial Yuan? Some say: "The High Courts and District Courts are the judicial organs of the provinces, cities, and counties, which is different from the Supreme Court, which is purely a central judicial organ." However, it is clearly stipulated in Article 107, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution that the establishment and implementation of the judicial system by the central government is a matter for the central government. Therefore, although the High Courts and District Courts are located in the provinces, cities, and counties, they are central judicial organs, which is no different from the Supreme Court. Moreover, according to the current system, the public functionary disciplinary organs originally had the Central Public Functionary Disciplinary Commission and the Local Public Functionary Disciplinary Commission, and their supervision of affairs and personnel administration are all handled directly by the Judicial Yuan. Citing that the offices of the Ministry of Personnel, the auditing offices, and the control offices in various provinces are all supervised separately by the Examination Yuan and the Control Yuan, respectively, it is also not permissible to treat the High Courts and District Courts of the provinces, cities, and counties differently and should be administered by the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>(5) According to the provisions of Article 77 of the Constitution, the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits, except for active military personnel who may be subject to military trials, for which there are special provisions in Article 9 of the Constitution, is administered by the Judicial Yuan. If the Judicial Yuan cannot administer it directly, then its administering organ must be a component of the Judicial Yuan's organization. The courts at all levels are components of the Judicial Yuan's organization, as can be seen from Article 82 of the Constitution, which stipulates: "The organization of courts at all levels shall be determined by law." This article is listed in Chapter 7, Judiciary, and not in Chapter 5, Executive. There is no doubt about it. If the High Courts and District Courts were established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Executive Yuan (it is heard that the draft Executive Yuan Organization Law stipulates that the Executive Yuan shall have a Ministry of Justice), even if their names are also courts, they are still components of the Executive Yuan's organization, and not components of the Judicial Yuan's organization. Looking at Article 4 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law, which stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall have the following organs: (1) The Supreme Court, (2) The Administrative Court, (3) The Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries," it does not stipulate that the Judicial Yuan shall establish High Courts in various provinces and cities, and District Courts in various counties and cities. Therefore, it can be known that the High Courts and District Courts are not established by the Judicial Yuan, i.e., they are not components of the Judicial Yuan's organization. Since they are not established by the Judicial Yuan, then it is clear that they are established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and are components of the Executive Yuan's organization. Is it not a violation of the Constitution to have components of the Executive Yuan's organization administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits? Although the parties may appeal or protest the judgments or rulings of the High Courts to the Supreme Court, it is no different from filing an administrative lawsuit with the Administrative Court established by the Judicial Yuan against the administrative organ that made the decision on the re-appeal. The administrative organ that made the decision on the re-appeal does not lose its nature as a component of the Executive Yuan because of this. So, how can the High Courts be considered components of the Judicial Yuan because of this? Some say: "Most of the courts in foreign countries are established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Cabinet. Why is it not a violation of the Constitution?" However, the constitutions of foreign countries mostly stipulate that the courts shall administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits, and the fact that the courts are established by the Ministry of Justice subordinate to the Cabinet is mostly permitted by their constitutions. Article 77 of our Constitution stipulates: "The Judicial Yuan shall administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits. Therefore, only components of the Judicial Yuan's organization can have this power." The provisions of the constitutions are completely different from each other. How can we apply their laws to our situation? Some say: "Since the Constitution clearly stipulates that the Judicial Yuan is the highest judicial organ of the State, it only needs to administer the Supreme Court, which is the highest level of trial, as its component, and the High Courts and District Courts, which administer lower-level trials, are not included." That is not the case. The so-called "highest" means "supreme," which does not necessarily exclude the lower levels. If it were as they say, then since the Constitution clearly stipulates that the Executive Yuan is the highest administrative organ, why don't the opposing theorists allow it to administer the judicial administration of the Supreme Court, and only allow it to administer the judicial administration of the lower courts? Moreover, what is the basis in the Constitution for making the lower courts components of the Executive Yuan's organization and allowing them to administer the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits? There is no need to waste words to explain why this argument is untenable. Since the courts at all levels that try civil and criminal lawsuits must be components of the Judicial Yuan's organization, then Article 4 of the Draft Judicial Yuan Organization Law must be changed to: "The Judicial Yuan shall have the following organs: (1) The Supreme Court, the High Courts of various provinces and cities, and the District Courts of various counties and cities, (2) The Administrative Court, (3) The Central Public Functionary Disciplinary Commission and the Local Public Functionary Disciplinary Commissions of various provinces and cities," in order to comply with the fundamental purposes of Article 77 and Article 82 of the Constitution. Since the provisions of the Judicial Yuan Organization Law should be like this, it goes without saying that the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts should be administered by the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>Refutation of Two Arguments</p>
<p>The above are the reasons why it should be interpreted under the Constitution that all judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan. Now, I will refute the two arguments held by the opposing theorists as follows:</p>
<p>One argument is that "the Ministries of Justice in foreign countries are all subordinate to the Cabinet. Our Executive Yuan is equivalent to the Cabinet in foreign countries, so the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Judicial Administration should naturally be subordinate to the Executive Yuan." According to this, the Federal Ministry of Justice in the United States can only supervise prosecutors and has no power to appoint, remove, or supervise the judges of the courts. This is completely different from the Ministries of Justice in civil law countries, which have overall control over the judicial administration of the entire country. Although the Ministries of Justice in civil law countries are subordinate to the Cabinet, their Ministers of Justice also have the power to administer the judicial administration of the highest-level courts. It goes without saying that it is inappropriate for the Ministry of Justice, which is at the same level as the highest-level court, to supervise the highest-level court. The reason why they do this is that they want to ensure that judicial administration is not disunited, and they do not want to establish a judicial official above the highest-level court who is equal in status to the Premier of the Cabinet. Therefore, they put two organs of the same level in the position of supervision and being supervised. Since our country has implemented the Five-Yuan system, and there is a President of the Judicial Yuan above the highest-level court who is equal in status to the Premier of the Executive Yuan, all judicial administration should be administered by the President of the Judicial Yuan. If we adopt the system of civil law countries, then not only the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts should be administered by the Ministry of Justice of the Executive Yuan, but also the judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the Commission on the Discipline of Public Functionaries must also be administered by the Executive Yuan, and the Judicial Yuan will have no room for existence. If we cannot but establish the Judicial Yuan and allow it to administer the judicial administration concerning the Supreme Court, then why is it necessary to transfer the judicial administration concerning the High Courts and District Courts to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan and establish a department to administer it, causing judicial administration to lose its unity? This argument is completely inconsistent with the spirit of the Five-Yuan system and is clearly unacceptable.</p>
<p>The second argument is that "Article 76 of the May 5th Draft Constitution explicitly stipulated: 'The Judicial Yuan shall administer judicial administration.' Later, the Political Consultative Conference resolved the principles for amending the draft constitution, and Item 4 stated: 'The Judicial Yuan shall be the highest court of the State and shall not also administer judicial administration. It shall be organized by several Grand Justices.' Therefore, Article 82 of the draft constitution submitted to the National Assembly stipulated: 'The Judicial Yuan is the highest trial organ of the State, administering the trial of civil, criminal, and administrative lawsuits and the interpretation of the Constitution.' There were no words about administering judicial administration. Article 77 of the Constitution also did not have such words. Judging from the legislative process, the Judicial Yuan actually has no power to administer judicial administration." According to this, the purpose of interpreting laws is to explore the meaning of the drafters, or to clarify the meaning of the law itself. There used to be disputes, but scholars in recent times have generally adopted the latter view. Therefore, the process of drafting the law and the reasons for the changes in the draft cannot restrict the interpreter. The meaning of the law should be clarified academically based on what is published as the law. The meaning of the Constitution is that the Judicial Yuan has the power to administer judicial administration, which has been clarified based on the above-mentioned reasons. The reason why the Constitution did not explicitly stipulate that judicial administration is administered by the Judicial Yuan, as in the May 5th Draft Constitution, is to maintain the consistency of its legislative style, and it was not appropriate to treat judicial administration differently. This has also been explained in Reason 1. As for the words in Item 4 of the principles for amending the draft constitution resolved by the Political Consultative Conference, which stated that the Judicial Yuan shall be the highest court of the State and shall not also administer judicial administration, it was not published as law in the Constitution and cannot be used to interpret the Constitution. Even if the Judicial Yuan directly administers the highest level of trial and does not establish a separate Supreme Court, there are administrative affairs concerning the highest level of trial. If the Judicial Yuan is not subordinate to the Executive Yuan, this type of judicial administration should still be administered by it. Since this type of judicial administration should be administered by it, why shouldn't the judicial administration concerning lower-level trials also be administered by it? This argument is also without reason.</p>
<p>Conclusion: From the above discussion, it is clear that all judicial administration concerning the trial portion should be administered by the Judicial Yuan under the interpretation of the Constitution. There is absolutely no reason to transfer the portion concerning the lower courts to the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. If the provisions of the draft organization laws for the Administrative and Judicial Yuans regarding this point are passed, it will not be in accordance with the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan has always been cautious in enacting laws and will not pass them easily.</p>

<p>Novel Tricks: Everyone Gets to Be an Official</p>
<p>In terms of administrative divisions, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) intentionally destroys the original government structure. Originally, the government had a total of one municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, three ordinary municipalities, seventeen commissioner districts, and one hundred and seven counties in Shandong. Today, the CCP has fragmented it into four municipalities under provincial jurisdiction, six administrative directorates (one of which is also incorporated into the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government), twenty-eight administrative commissioner's offices (two of which are the Longkou and Zibo Special Zone Commissioner's Offices), nine directorate-administered cities, and one hundred and seventy-seven counties. In addition, the CCP uniformly changes the original local townships and towns into administrative districts, and the original Baojia system into boards and neighborhoods, combining several households into a neighborhood, several neighborhoods into a board, and several boards (about the original several villages) into an administrative district. With novel tricks and frequent increases in official positions, everyone you meet is either a department head or bureau chief, or a director or commissioner. Everyone gets to be an official, and everyone gets to enjoy the benefits. The CCP takes advantage of the Chinese people's vanity for "reputation," not hesitating to destroy the original administrative divisions of the government in order to carry out its separatist conspiracy and ruling ambition.</p>

<h3>The Crisis of Our Age</h3>
<p>— By Chuantong Xian</p>
<p>The Crisis of Our Age, by Sorokin</p>
<p>This book is a recent work by the contemporary sociological authority Pitirim Sorokin. It has been published in eight editions within three years of its release in the United States, demonstrating its significant influence. Previously, he authored the three major works "Contemporary Sociological Theories," "Social and Cultural Dynamics," and "Social Mobility," and has served as the president of the International Sociological Association and the chairman of the Department of Sociology at Harvard University. Although he is Russian, he does not support Soviet socialism. He is erudite and well-versed in both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign knowledge. This book is the essence of his previous monumental works. This article can be considered the essence of this essence.</p>
<p>His theme is clearly stated in his book "Social and Cultural Dynamics," where he says:</p>
<p>"Contemporary Western society's life, organization, and culture, in any important aspect, is facing an extraordinary crisis. Both its body and soul exhibit significant morbidity… We seem to be in the middle of two eras: one is a sensate culture with a glorious past and now dying; the other is a future, creative ideational culture. Sensate culture has had more than six hundred years of glorious history, and is now coming to an end. We are now living in this near-end sensate culture era, and our thoughts and actions are still influenced by this era. Although this dying era still has its past glory, it has reached a state of twilight brilliance. Its shadows are gradually enveloping us, making us at a loss as to how to adapt to this twilight darkness. This transitional period's night will come upon us, and we will encounter the horror of darkness. But after passing through this dark journey, we will see the dawn of a great new culture, which is the ideational culture, and it will welcome future people." The crisis of today's world is seen too simply by some, who believe that it is the same as the many crises that humanity has encountered in history, merely a number of difficulties encountered by humanity in the economic, financial, military, and political realms. Therefore, they believe that as long as humanity can improve international relations, improve economic systems, and change political situations, this crisis can be easily resolved. There are also those, like Spengler (the author of "The Decline of the West"), who believe that Western culture has reached the stage of death and is entirely beyond remedy. The author of this book believes that both views are wrong. The crisis in today's world is not just a matter of political and economic details, but a problem in the entire way of being and thinking. It is the corrosion of the entire culture. However, the corrosion of the old culture is not the complete destruction of this culture but a transformation into a new culture.</p>
<p>The author views the development of human culture as a cyclical cycle of three stages: (1) the ideational culture stage, which is otherworldly, transcendental, and sacred, and which enslaves the body with the soul and dominates material enjoyment with spiritual values; (2) the idealistic culture stage, which is a transitional culture, half sacred and half mundane, both soul and matter; (3) the sensate culture stage, which is worldly, mundane, and utilitarian, which advocates physical enjoyment and is enslaved by the body. For example, Greece from the 9th to the 6th century BC was an ideational culture, while Greco-Roman culture from the 4th century BC to the 4th century AD was a sensate culture; the Middle Ages were an ideational culture, and the last six hundred years have been a sensate culture. The transitional period between these two cultures is the so-called idealistic culture. This stage is very short, and the author believes that Western culture is now the demise of sensate culture, and today's crisis is the demise of Western sensate culture. This demise of sensate culture will cause Western culture to go through a short idealistic culture stage, and then produce a new ideational culture.</p>
<p>In this book, the author proves his theory from the developmental history of Western art, science, philosophy, religion, ethics, and law. He feels that in today's Western society, the above aspects have gradually reached the stage of ossification and corruption of sensate culture. In this stage of Western society, many morbidities have occurred. First, the increase in criminal behavior and the [text missing]; second, the prevalence of mental illness and the alarming number of suicides; third, the massacre of large-scale wars and revolutions that seize power through bloodshed; plus fourth, economic destruction and life coercion.</p>
<p>Modern sensate culture is facing the opportunity of disintegration, and it presents four phenomena in recent cultural dynamics: (1) disharmony and internal contradictions, for example, on the one hand, shouting for human equality, and on the other hand, showing extreme inequalities in knowledge, morality, economy, and politics; again, for example, on the one hand, wanting to pursue the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people, and on the other hand, creating unprecedented catastrophes for mankind. (2) A dazzling array of things, mixed together and not forming a unified culture. In today's Western society, we can see people simultaneously engaging in Indian opium, Turkish baths, Chinese tea, and believing in Eastern religions and philosophies, forming a chaotic kaleidoscope. (3) Only seeking quantitative growth and not caring about qualitative nobility, only seeking superficial dazzling and not caring about intrinsic value. For example, stage performances are large gatherings of hundreds of performers and musicians; schools are only full of students and staff; the quality of books depends on the number of sales; the quality of scholars depends on the number of audiences. (4) The imprisonment of creativity. In modern works, people's creative abilities are gradually invisible. Composers of the nineteenth century, such as Wagner, Tchaikovsky, and even Debussy, have not been seen in the twentieth century; nineteenth-century writers such as Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Byron, Goethe, and Balzac have not seen a shadow in the twentieth century; the same is true in other areas such as plays, painting, and sculpture. At most, there are still many contributions in mechanical engineering, but even in that aspect, there are signs of decline.</p>
<p>The trend of future culture is towards the ideational form. The current culture is not destroyed but only used to achieve sacred purposes. The current transitional period cannot be avoided, but we must reduce the pain it gives to people and make this period pass quickly. He said: "Man is not only an organism, but also a transmitter of 'absolute value.'... The greatest mission of culture, whether in science, technology, religion, philosophy, ethics, or art, is only the reflection and realization of this 'absolute value' in the experienced world."</p>
<h3>Reading "The Conquest of Happiness"</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhilong</p>
<p>By Bertrand Russell, Translated by Chuan Lei, South Country Edition</p>
<p>This is a good book full of warmth and wisdom. The author first tells us that this book is not dedicated to erudite scholars, nor to those who use practical problems as conversation starters. It has neither profound philosophical principles nor extensive quotations. It only summarizes some reasonable opinions. The doctrines adopted are all confirmed by the author's own experience and observation, and each time he follows these doctrines, he increases his own happiness. In the current distressed and turbulent environment, everyone craves the arrival of happiness. But happiness is neither inheritance nor a gift. Happiness needs to be fought for by human beings. So this book is actually called "The Conquest of Happiness". It tells people how to fight for happiness.</p>
<p>In this book, it does give a lot of help to many men and women who are suffering from melancholy. With appropriate efforts, happiness can be obtained. Of course, unhappiness has various reasons. The external reasons are the material environment and the existing system, which cannot be achieved solely through individual efforts. The internal reasons are psychological problems and traditional beliefs, which are within the scope of individual ability, but are often unknown to the individual, or even unwilling to correct. Those feelings of selfishness, suspicion, anxiety, and self-indulgence can be overcome. The author tells us one by one our illnesses. He tells us that the reasons for unhappiness are self-immersion, romantic melancholy, competition, boredom and excitement, fatigue, jealousy, criminal consciousness, being abused, and fearing public opinion.</p>
<p>Those who are "self-immersed" put "self" in their minds at all times and in all places, and use their own interests to measure friendship, entertainment, and work. There is only one "self" in their minds, and they regard the entire world as material for building a person's own splendor, sacrificing all the elements of humanity to cultivate one element, and when cultivating their vanity to a high degree, they are not interested in anyone except themselves. As a result, they form typical morbid psychology such as guilt, self-indulgence, and narcissism.</p>
<p>The so-called romantic melancholy, however, is accustomed to a kind of "unhappy" pride, as if their wisdom has seen through the sincerity of the previous generation, and they feel that there is nothing in the world worth living for, and they feel all kinds of emptiness, that there is nothing new under the sun, and that people are always working, and things are always turbulent, but nothing is permanent. This kind of talented melancholy is actually due to too much leisure.</p>
<p>"Competition", the hard work and competition of ordinary people is not a necessary struggle for life, but actually a struggle for success. What they fear is not not having breakfast, but fearing that they will not be able to show off their power and surpass their neighbors. When asked what contribution their work can make to the public, they have nothing to answer. And their psychological state is exactly the same as that of a hundred-meter runner, but their end point is the grave. In fact, "success" can only be a component of creating happiness. If you sacrifice all the remaining components to win this one component, the price is too high. The reality of success will inevitably make people endure the torment of boredom, unless they first know how to deal with success.</p>
<p>"Boredom and excitement" are also unhappy psychology. The so-called "boredom" means that the status quo is in front of you, and other more pleasant situations are hovering in your imagination. So boredom is essentially a desire for accidents to happen, and what is desired is not necessarily pleasant things. The opposite of boredom is not joy but excitement. The higher we climb on the social ladder, the more intense the pursuit of stimulation becomes. As a result, anyone who is capable of pursuing it is always running around without warming their seat, forming a cycle of boredom and excitement, never having happiness. True happiness is happiness in quiet. Their joy is not the kind that others think is exciting. All great achievements must go through long-term and unremitting work, not the pursuit of excitement.</p>
<p>Speaking of "fatigue", a kind of mental exhaustion. This kind of fatigue is mostly caused by anxiety. Living in this tense society, it is difficult to relax the nerves, and constantly having to contact strangers will lead to constant tension. The nerves are fragmented and fall into fatigue. This kind of person is like putting a curtain between a person and the outside world. He feels that the impressions are blurred and the sounds are weak. He has no ability to pay attention to the surrounding people. He has no pleasure in food and sunshine, but just keeps thinking about some problems, which will only become more and more tired and unable to rest.</p>
<p>Among the many major causes of unhappiness, jealousy is the first to be eliminated. Jealousy is a bad habit, partly spiritual. It mainly comes from never looking at things from the things themselves, but from their relationships. It is certainly not happy to look at the outside world with jealousy. He knows that there are some things that are more beautiful than himself by his side, but he does not know where they are and how to find them. In despair, jealousy occupies him, and sadness and anger enter his soul. The appropriate remedy is to cultivate spiritual discipline, expand the mind, and must be able to transcend the self. Be free and unfettered by transcending the self, like the universe.</p>
<p>People with criminal consciousness can never be separated from the feeling of crime and feel that they are not worthy of being included in the upper class. This cannot be used as an upward call, but as a morbidity. Our traditional morality has always been an overly self-centered concept of sin, and this is an unwise part of "self-centeredness." The author believes that superstitious morality should be eliminated, and the sense of guilt should be indicated by a reasonable ethical view. Criminal consciousness not only cannot promote a good life, but leads to the opposite result. It makes people unhappy and ashamed. He harbors anger and hatred towards superior people. He will find jealousy easy and admiration difficult. He will become generally unpopular, more and more lonely, and will never have a sense of happiness.</p>
<p>As for "masochism"; extreme masochism is a kind of madness and a very serious disease. What is usually displayed in life is the constant feeling of being persecuted. In fact, it is because of the lack of sympathy, which makes it easy to prove that he is disgusted by the public. Or he looks too high on himself. I am fundamentally against the other party's will and give favor to people. We always have tender love and deep respect for ourselves, and we expect others to do the same to us. We never thought that we cannot expect others to treat us better than we treat others.</p>
<p>The last chapter is "Fearing Public Opinion": Generally speaking, everyone, except for experts, always attaches too much importance to other people's opinions. They may be enslaved by social public opinion and feel distressed. In fact, truly ignoring public opinion is a kind of power. A society full of men and women who do not bow to the world is definitely more interesting than a society where everyone acts in the same way. In places where the character of each person develops individually, there will be different types. Of course, people should not deliberately act strangely, and it is equally boring as those who are conservative and rigid. People should be natural. They should respect their innate tastes within the scope that is not fundamentally anti-social.</p>
<p>The above chapters are all passively attacking psychological problems and liberating a person from the prison of self-confinement. In the following chapters, the author tells us how to actively open the road to the soul and seek happiness. How to become happy people through interest, love, family, work, leisure, effort and abandonment. He writes that the secret to happiness is to expand your interests as much as possible and to make your reactions to people as friendly as possible.</p>
<p>Russell's book is full of warm human emotions, without preaching, and does not tell people to escape reality. On the contrary, it teaches people to face reality and liberate themselves. In this great stream of life, offer your love. He shares and breathes with people. Such a person feels that he is a citizen of the universe, freely enjoying the colors and joys provided by the world. He is not confused by death, because he feels that he is not really separated from those who come later. If you deeply merge with the long stream of life, the highest and greatest joy can be found.</p>
<p>Mr. Chuan Lei's translation is faithful and fluent, without any carelessness, and is quite commendable. And the simple and beautiful cover design makes people feel that the book itself is happiness.</p>

<p>Now I would like to introduce one to you.</p>
<p>This book, "Learning and Fighting," undoubtedly points the way for beginners! The author's writing is simple and easy to understand. Only a secondary school education is needed to understand its content. Therefore, whether you are a student or a working youth, it is suitable to take this book as a guide to preliminary study.</p>
<p>Summarizing the content of the book, in short, it is like this:</p>

<h3>After Reading "A Constitutional History of the United States"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shichuan</p>
<p>"A Constitutional History of the United States" By Andrew C. Mclaughlin</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to the U.S. Constitution know that the basic principle of the U.S. Constitution is the separation of powers, that is, Congress exercises legislative power, the President exercises executive power, and the Supreme Court exercises judicial power. The three powers are not only separate from each other, but in fact, they check each other, which is the so-called principle of checks and balances. However, in recent years, domestic scholars discussing the presidential system often only emphasize the President's being checked by Congress, while glossing over the relationship between Congress and the judiciary. If mentioned, the position of the Supreme Court is greatly diminished, because the Supreme Court justices must be approved by the Senate of Congress, and Congress can impeach and try them to remove them from office. This view makes it difficult for us to understand the true relationship between the legislature and the judiciary. If this relationship is not clear, it is difficult to understand the entire meaning of checks and balances. Recently, I read this "A Constitutional History of the United States" and would like to briefly discuss the relationship between the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress, and its position in the constitutional development history, based on what I learned from the book.</p>
<p>According to the Constitution, the President may appoint Supreme Court justices with the consent of the Senate. This point we can only consider to be Congress checking the President, not checking the Supreme Court. According to the Constitution, judges (who are civil officers) can be impeached and removed from office if they commit crimes such as treason and bribery. Here we must note that although the House of Representatives can file an impeachment, only the Senate has the power to try the impeachment case. As for removal from office, it requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate members present. Although the Constitution stipulates this, in fact, impeachment cases are not common in U.S. constitutional history. There have only been two cases of impeaching judges: the first was the impeachment of John Pickering (a federal district judge in New Hampshire), but he was not a Supreme Court justice, and according to his son's claim, he actually had a mental illness, so although he was removed from office, it is not worth paying attention to. A more serious case was the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase; but the Senate trial resulted in a verdict of not guilty. Therefore, no Supreme Court justice has been impeached and removed from office in U.S. constitutional history. If we ignore the position of the Supreme Court simply because Congress has the power to impeach and try, that is very inappropriate.</p>
<p>Conversely, the Supreme Court can check Congress because it can review whether the laws passed by Congress are in accordance with the Constitution. Although this power is not explicitly stipulated in the Constitution, Chief Justice John Marshall laid the foundation for exercising this power in the Marbury v. Madison case (1803). In this case, Marshall declared part of the Judiciary Act (1789) passed by Congress invalid because that part authorized the Supreme Court to issue writs of mandamus, but the Constitution did not grant this power to the Supreme Court, so that part was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court's possession of this power is very important because it can limit Congress's legislation to within the scope of the Constitution, preventing Congress from doing whatever it wants. Chief Justice Taney declared the Missouri Compromise invalid. Some of President Roosevelt's "New Deal" legislation was also deemed invalid by the Supreme Court. Therefore, although Congress can check the President, and the President can appoint judges (once judges are appointed, they serve for life, and the President has no power to remove them), Congress is checked by the Supreme Court. If we recognize the relationship between these three, then the meaning of checks and balances will be easily understood.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court not only checks the legislation of Congress, but also occupies the most important position in the development history of the Constitution. Especially in the early days when Marshall was Chief Justice (from 1801 to 1835), the Supreme Court's reputation and power were extremely high. At that time, the federal government had not been established for long, and there were no precedents to follow for the interpretation of the Constitution, so Marshall's meaning could be said to be the meaning of the Constitution. Fortunately, Marshall was a great judge. Although he also had biases, he had a broad vision, and his rulings almost all became the unalterable truths for interpreting the Constitution, making great contributions to the development of the country and the stability of the federal government's power.</p>
<p>We naturally cannot deny the greatness of the legislative and executive powers of the United States, but we should not underestimate the judicial power. At least in the history of constitutional development, the influence and contribution of the U.S. Supreme Court is far beyond what Congress and the President can compare to.</p>
<h3>Bertrand Russell Who Believes Education Can Transform the World</h3>
<h3>Random Talks at Dubo</h3>
<p>— Wu Cong</p>
<p>I once said to my friend Ma:</p>
<p>"Confucius certainly has his greatness, but according to my respectful statement, he is a person, he eats, and he farts."</p>
<p>However, the things that surprise me are truly many. Many so-called "some kind of expert" types often make many high-sounding arguments.</p>
<p>"Gorky's nose is greatly flat, Lu Xun's face is eternally swollen. Tolstoy relies entirely on his big mane, and Liebniz doesn't have a big head either? And Guo Moruo because of...because...therefore..."</p>
<p>So the "some kind of expert" types put on a big bow tie like Pushkin or Shakespeare, frown like Gorky, bulge their eyes like Nietzsche. Learn... go to a photo studio to take a ten-inch enlargement, and then self-admire. In addition, they praise each other, and a new Shakespeare or Pushkin is announced.</p>
<p>I hate obliteration the most; there is gold in the sand, the gold does not become not gold because it comes from the sand.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is unwise to mythologize the shortcomings of great men.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a strange tendency. When a person has good deeds, and his ability in a certain aspect is undeniable, not only is his few weaknesses not acknowledged, but they are especially embellished. This is really an unwise thing to do. Because once your embellishments are discovered, your reputation will unfortunately be obliterated at the same time.</p>
<p>I have witnessed many good generals who like to be refined and elegant, and claim that their calligraphy and literature can make them famous in the world. The result is that they waste rice paper and ink, and the lucky ones are those merchants who forge ancient paintings.</p>
<p>The "Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books" printed by Zhonghua Book Company and the "Wan You Wen Ku" printed by Commercial Press are said to sell very well. Because many big shots and merchants can use them as decorations in their studies.</p>
<p>A message to cultural merchants, there are many bulky books, there is no need to print words in the book, as long as the book cover has a name on it, it saves typesetting and ink, and if the books cannot be sold, they can be used as children's scratchpads.</p>
<p>In fact, to be more concise, cultural merchants can make several book boxes engraved with "Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books" or "Encyclopedia Britannica" and sell them. They can be used as elegant decorations or as clothes boxes. I think this stupid business can be done.</p>
<p>Schiller, in his play "Intrigue and Love," said through the mouth of Miller: "Great criminals, who themselves lose their way in a corrupt society, often use tears of love to rescue those innocent people!"</p>
<p>How many great people! Have walked into prison with their eyes wide open, but cannot help but shed tears, watching many kind young people walk to their side, becoming more prominent day by day.</p>
<p>Missionaries say. Christ took the sins of the poor and was nailed to the glorious cross. All Christ asked for was blind faith. I have never doubted Christ's greatness, but I am concerned about whether the poor can be saved.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>No Wonder</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>The general manager, deputy general manager, assistant manager, associate manager, etc. hold a meeting to discuss the company's business policy. In the middle of the meeting, the deputy general manager expressed some doubts about a staff member in the purchasing department.</p>
<p>No wonder he's been living lavishly lately.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>No wonder he even made a Melton cloth coat. Where did he get the money?</p>
<p>No wonder he hasn't borrowed salary this month.</p>
<p>How can he make ends meet without borrowing salary?</p>
<p>No wonder he even gave a gift for your son's birthday.</p>
<p>Who asked him to give a gift?</p>
<p>No wonder he was able to get married last year.</p>
<p>No wonder he can even raise a son.</p>
<p>He has money to raise a son?</p>
<p>Is this the time for them to raise children?</p>
<p>No wonder there's often money missing from the warehouse.</p>
<p>No wonder there are often goods missing from the warehouse.</p>
<p>The company can't afford such a big loss!</p>
<p>He's so daring!</p>
<p>No wonder there's always a bit of wickedness in his eyes.</p>
<p>No wonder he usually doesn't dare to look me in the eye.</p>
<p>No wonder the company's profits last year couldn't keep up with the cost of living index.</p>
<p>No wonder all the employees in the company have lost weight in the past few months, except for him.</p>
<p>He certainly has very strong suspicions.</p>
<p>He is suspected of stealing money.</p>
<p>He is suspected of stealing goods.</p>
<p>No wonder he often arrives earlier than others.</p>
<p>No wonder he often leaves later than others.</p>
<p>No wonder one day I saw him alone in the office looking flustered.</p>
<p>No wonder the next day there was a bill that couldn't be found no matter how much we looked for it.</p>
<p>No wonder I once saw him take a package out.</p>
<p>No wonder his coat pockets were full that day.</p>
<p>No wonder I always felt there was a thief in the company.</p>
<p>No wonder I always felt that this thief was him!</p>
<p>The result of the meeting was that the next day the company announced the start of austerity measures, and that "thief" who was "no wonder" ate the first knife of layoffs.</p>
<h3>A Customer at a Coffee Shop</h3>
<p>— Yin Bo</p>
<p>To say that coffee shops are places specifically for people to sip coffee is not entirely true.</p>
<p>Whether it's the International Building on the third floor or the fourteenth and eighteenth floors, Didi's on Avenue Joffre, Fuxing or Kafkas, or even Sassoon and Cathay on the Bund, for all the customers, few are truly leisurely there to "sip coffee" in the true sense of the word. They mostly come "for a purpose"!</p>
<p>If you have half a day to spare, you might as well take a tour of some famous coffee shops. That's enough for you to see.</p>
<p>First of all, there are those friends who talk business seriously. The so-called business, of course, refers to the broad sense, including real goods trading, but also empty-headed brokers, and even using coffee shops as temporary rental locations for "opening a can opener" and "bargaining." Some are beaming and spitting, while others are crestfallen and at a loss. They are mostly talking loudly, and even if the people around them cast surprised or even disgusted glances, they are still talking with relish, as if there were no one else around.</p>
<p>In terms of the second most numerous, then it is the people who use coffee shops as temporary resting places. They regard coffee shops as a station on a journey, and their function is quite similar to the ten-mile pavilion between two villages in the countryside. They either come from different places, or they come from the same place and plan to go to an even farther place together. So, at this station, they unfold the plans and aspirations for the next journey. This group of people comes and goes in a hurry, and there is no way to talk about leisure.</p>
<p>In addition, there are couples who borrow coffee shops as a "paradise on earth" for love affairs. Of course, there are also differences in the degree between them, from "blind dates" or introductions to getting to know each other, from initial socializing to swearing oaths of love, truly all kinds of shapes and colors, nothing is missing. As for those men and women who cannot get their fill of whispering in each other's ears, thank goodness, there are also thoughtful bosses who have arranged isolated seats for them. The Leaves Coffee Shop on Avenue Foch is calling for this.</p>
<p>Another type of people spend their days sitting (they call it "hatching") in coffee shops, like going to a public office. Every year, every month, regardless of wind or rain, they arrive on time. Three, four, five or six people occupy a table, set up a dragon gate formation, talking about everything from astronomy to geography, talking about politics and women. Who says they are "killing time"? That's laughable. In their own eyes, this is the most serious business.</p>
<p>A relatively small number of people read newspapers and listen to music in coffee shops. Of course, there are even fewer people like me who use coffee tables as writing desks to write articles. But in any case, in the end, they all come "for a purpose," so I finally think:</p>
<p>To say that coffee shops are places specifically for people to sip coffee is not entirely true.</p>
<h3>"Old Man"</h3>
<p>— A Lu</p>
<p>The emperors in Chinese history really regarded the people as straw dogs - there is an anecdote about Zhu Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty notes "Jiansheng Yewen". Hongwu came from a humble background, so he should understand some "feelings of the people". But no, here's an example:</p>
<p>"Taizu once traveled incognito in the capital, and heard an old woman secretly call Shang 'old man'; the emperor was furious. He went to Grand Tutor Xu's house, walked around the room, and pondered endlessly. At that time, the Grand Tutor was away, and his wife was shocked, fearing that there would be other misfortunes. She kowtowed again and again, 'Is it not that the foolish husband Xu Da has committed a crime against Your Majesty?' Taizu said, 'No, madam, do not worry.' He immediately ordered the five city garrison commanders to summon all the troops and said, 'Zhang Shicheng stole Jiangdong, and the people of Wu still call him King Zhang. Now that I am the Son of Heaven, why do the residents of this country call me old man?' He immediately ordered the confiscation of many people's homes."</p>
<p>Because "I am the Son of Heaven," the people should compete to call "Long live." The ruling class of China has such a view. This "old woman" probably did not "come from a famous family," so she did not understand these major laws. Why did this old woman dare to call the "emperor" "old man"? Taizu asked, "Why?" He didn't wait for anyone to answer, so he "immediately" confiscated people's homes. This also shows that those officials of the "five city garrison commander and the like" were all "shocked" extremely.</p>
<h3>"The Golden Promise"</h3>
<p>— Running Water</p>
<p>The directorial style of "The Golden Promise" is fresh and beautiful, just like that bay of lake in the male protagonist's childhood love period, implying how much warmth in the desolation.</p>
<p>The capture of several major characters, the young doctor of psychological therapy; the prodigal son who found a new lease on life; all have profound images. Director Sam Wood has shown extremely exquisite and moving portrayals of the characters' emotions and the surrounding atmosphere at the turning points of human relationships. Look, how excellently that young doctor of psychological therapy went to announce to his childhood companion (now a paraplegic in bed) the process of his legs being cut off, how excellently this climax was handled, how well that poem was recited, and the excited state of the three characters in the sickroom, making people unable to restrain themselves.</p>
<p>But the success of the script for "The Golden Promise" further helped the completeness of the entire performance. The threading of those tragic atmospheres until the final climax, but made a paraplegic strive healthily upwards, what a great transformation this is. Because this ending is powerful, it makes the characters even more emotional. The script should be praised.</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan, playing a worker's daughter, changed her style and washed away her past coquettish demeanor. Her road is wide, and she also performs extremely well. Robert Cummings plays a studious young student who later becomes a psychological therapist, and has always been able to maintain his simple character and identity. The final climax, persuading his companion, is also extremely refined. The other male and female actors are all excellent.</p>

<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Okay, let's not argue first, different people have different opinions." He still said in a very resolute tone: "In short, we businessmen have our own views. Now, I don't care about anything else, I only know how to use all my strength to transport all the goods in my hands out. You say I'm doing it for the country, you say I'm doing it for myself! I don't care! You in the cultural world have a broad vision and think it's necessary to hold a donation campaign to comfort the troops. I definitely don't object; and, with a clear conscience, you, brother, say a fair word, has Old Xu done his best? Now, you're forcing me to donate such a large amount. It's really difficult for me to help with this matter!"</p>
<p>In the end, he was a bit assertive.</p>
<p>But Zhu Zhaonian didn't give him a way to back down. This thin, tall man sat down on the long sofa again, took out a piece of candy from his pocket, peeled off the paper, and chewed happily. His gaze had been fixed on the fat Xu on the opposite side, not moving for a long time. The fat man was a little uneasy from being watched by him, and slightly turned his face, sucking on the half of a Camel cigarette hanging on the corner of his mouth unnaturally.</p>
<p>The room was silent for two or three minutes.</p>
<p>"Old Zhu, don't stare at me like that, okay?" After holding on for a while, Xu Shaoming first begged for mercy. "I'm also the kind of person who values friends the most. For your sake, I'll donate 50,000 yuan alone! This should satisfy everyone!" Saying this, he suddenly lowered his voice again. "If you, brother, want to leave in the next few days, you can come to me at any time. We have several cars going to Dushan, and it shouldn't be a problem for you alone. We're all our own people, so there's no need to talk about money!" He thought Old Zhu should be satisfied and leave.</p>
<p>"Thank you, I haven't thought about fleeing yet!" Old Zhu was just that ungrateful. "We're already living like refugees here; if we really want to leave Guilin, we're only fit to be refugees. It doesn't matter if we take a car or not." Old Zhu simply didn't look like he was preparing to flee.</p>
<p>The fat man didn't expect him to be so stubborn.</p>
<p>"The news hasn't been good these past few days. It's said that the Japanese have reached Lingling, and the Bai mansion and the Li mansion have all been emptied!" He wanted to try to scare him again.</p>
<p>"We have nothing to lose and travel light. It's still time to leave when the enemy really reaches Guilin." Old Zhu simply didn't look like he was preparing to flee.</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming was at a loss. (Twelve)</p>
