<h3>新加坡色相</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　吳嘉棠</p>
<p>隨中航機視察南洋追記之三</p>
<p>上海市民天天愁着物價的高漲，工潮的澎湃和工資的激增，要是他們知道了新加坡的情形還要比上海嚴重幾倍，也許心裏會得到一些寬慰吧！　譬如拿食米一項來說，在新加坡每石米售價新幣一百四十元，照現行匯率折算起來，便是每石米售美金七十元，比較起上海的米價來，要高出七倍左右，可是一般薪水階級的薪給，並不比上海人增多七倍，一個寫字間職員的平均薪水約爲新幣三百元，在新加坡，這樣的薪水還算是不錯的哩。據某僑胞吿訴記者，在新加坡最節省的生活，亦需新幣五百元之譜，的合美金二百五十元，這樣，那裏薪水階級生活的困苦可想而知了。</p>
<p>但是，新加坡工人的待遇是比較優越的，戰後各職業工會像雨後春笋般茁長着，據當地人士統計，在人口約計九十五萬的新埠，已經成立的工會約計二百七十個。新加奴的整個工人運動，是由某華僑共產黨員張明今領導下的馬來共產黨（「馬共」）指揮着的。新加坡的每一個工會裏面，差不多全有共產黨滲入，許多實業家們想使他們的工廠避免發生週期性的罷工，差不多是一樁沒有希望的事情了。</p>
<p>據當地某實業界領袖吿訴記者，不熟練工人的平均工資，是每日新幣五元，折合美金二元五角，這數目和上海一般的工資比較起來，似乎已很可觀，然而那裏的工人都說，欲使每月的收支相抵，是煞費苦心的一回事。</p>
<p>綜觀新加坡的經濟全貌，覺得是百業蕭條，戰後復興工作進行遲遲。新加坡的經濟機構，大部分建立在樹膠上面，可是在世界市塲中，樹膠的價格從原來的每磅美金四角五分，跌到每磅二角九分。據當地樹膠業中人說，生產樹膠每磅的成本約美金三角九分，因此他們售出每磅樹膠，就得虧蝕若干血本。樹膠的跌價，反映着馬來的整個經濟情形，隨時隨地你可以遇見人們皺眉蹙額，搖頭嘆息。</p>
<p>除了樹膠的跌價以外，荷屬東印度的戰事更使新加坡的駁運業受到很大的打擊。新加坡向來由荷印輸入大量的樹膠，食糖和食米，而以各種製造品供給印尼市塲，但目前由於荷蘭對印尼港口實施封鎖的結果，進出口貿易幾乎完全陷於停頓了。在印尼共和國區域以內，雖有小規模的私運貿易仍在進行中，但大半危險性太大，不能引起正當商人的興趣。</p>
<p>配合着英帝國保存外匯準備的政策，新加坡當局最近對各現幣地區停發輸入許可證，這並不是說，你可以得到取道香港偸運入新埠的美國製造品。可是一般地說來，在過去數月間，新加坡的進出口業略見入超，本年一月至五月間，輸入總額計新幣五八一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，輸出總額五六九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，同時期內，新加坡對美輸出額計新幣一五八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，自美輸入額祗有三七，五〇〇，〇〇〇元，結果保持了美元的出超。</p>
<p>高昂的生活費，日軍佔領時期所遺留下來的敗壞的風氣，和英國人的不能建立一個效率高强的行政機構，這幾種因素合併起來，造成了殖民地政府的貪汚凟職的普遍現象。據僑胞吿訴記者，政府官吏的「敲詐」行爲，是司空見慣的事情。馬來人希望有一個廉潔政府，這希望在戰前並不見得怎樣光明，到現在却更顯得黯淡了。</p>
<p>試舉一事為例，以說明新加坡官場的敲詐行為。依照政府的規定，市民需要購買汽車時，須先經當局批准，取得購買車輛許可證。然而事實上，一個新加坡居民無需申請許可證，可以走進任何一家汽車公司的樣子間而得到一輛汽車。據常地居民說，取得許可證的方法，不一而足，每張的代價是新幣六百元到一千元。</p>
<p>就政治方面說，新加坡可以算是東南亞全區域中的一個最重要的共產黨中樞。共產黨在戰前是禁止活動的，當日軍佔領時期，他們在抗日義勇軍的旗幟下，組織了一個强有力的抗日團體，這團體的軍火一部分是英人供給的，一部分是從日軍手中奪得的。在馬來北部，據說以前的遊擊隊至今還携帶着武器。</p>
<p>「馬共」在新島各地公然活動，總部的首領是一個中國人。據說「首共」直接受命於莫斯科，負責指揮南海區的一切共黨活動。</p>
<p>同時，由於馬來政治活動不受約束</p>
<p>使新加坡變成了我國國內政治的鬥爭塲所。新加坡的親國民黨份子和反國民黨份子，兩派軋礫甚烈，嫌隙日深，去年雙十國慶節曾經發生敵對慶祝的事情。最近舉行孔誕紀念儀式時，親國民黨和反國民黨兩派又發生紛歧的行動。</p>
<p>最近英國移民當局會拒絕一位蘇聯駐新採辦商更換新護照，這位採辦商曾經從幾家中國商行購買大批樹膠和其他物產。據未證實之謠傳這位蘇聯採舟辦商藉交易活動暗地裏給予當地共產黨以經濟援助。許多人說，他的護照雖被吊銷了，可是他還沒有離開新加　，但另有人說他已到香港去了。</p>
<h3>內蒙阿拉善旗　荒漠的綠洲　物產豐富國防地位重要</h3>
<p>〔中央社寗夏七日電〕阿拉善旂爲內蒙特別旗之一，在行政上不屬於盟，而直屬於蒙藏委員會，旂境面積約爲一千方公里，現有人口六萬多，營游牧生活，民性忠厚，迄無鬥爭之事發生，倘非强鄰壓境，實爲西北草原上之「世外桃源」。該旂政府所在地爲定遠營，樹木林立環境優美，乃荒漠之綠洲，因其建築多倣自北平，故有「小北京」之稱，記者前往考察時，曾注意該旗文化敎育及經濟，今就所獲印象略述於後，藉供關心邊疆者之參考：</p>
<p>阿旗現有國立實騐小學，旂立實騐小學及蒙文補習學校，共計三所，均設於定遠營，每校學生均在四百名以上，前二者爲完全小學，兼收蒙藏子弟，除授普通課程外，並敎以蒙文。後者純爲蒙民及喇嘛中之適齡學童不諳國語亦多不識蒙文而設，故在施敎時，蒙文與國文並重，四年畢業後，按其程度，分別插入完全小學，繼續就讀，該旂扎薩克達理扎雅，爲內蒙王公中之最開明者，渠所施行之强迫敎育，已已獲相當成就。據謂：擬於明年成立中學一所，俾可深造蒙民子弟，惟甚感人才之不够，希望各方予以協助。此外，有一中央直屬黨所辦之阿旗簡報，爲該旂僅有之石印報紙，每日抄收中央廣播電台之簡明新聞，以蒙文與國文刋印發行，日銷三百份，除供六千人口之定遠營民衆閱讀外，並分送旗境內各重要地點。</p>
<p>經濟方面，昔年與外蒙通商時，定遠營之商業，曾盛極一時，其後外蒙關係斷絕，商業已逐漸衰落，但旂內物產之豐，甲於內蒙各旗。將米經濟前途，則大有可爲。全旗現有之牲畜，羊約七八十萬頭，駱駝十餘萬頭，馬萬餘匹，每年出產之羊毛及駝毛，平均在百萬斤以上，其所產之甘草，麝香等，尙屬於次要地位。礦產方面，則有煤鹽鹼等，煤鹼因無大需要，故出產不大。鹽之產量較大，但每年亦不過千担而已，全旗共有鹽湖十三處，以現已開採之吉蘭泰池爲最大，週圍達二百餘華里，深度約爲一丈五尺，產出之鹽，不惟潔白味美，且可於今歲挖掘後，明年復生，洵爲取之不盡，用之不竭之寳藏。</p>
<p>就目前現狀而言，阿拉善已爲內蒙四十九旗之最進步之一旗，但以國防觀點言之，其一切措施，則尙須作最大之努力，阿旗與外蒙，有四百華里之毗連地帶，因旂內出產特多，在經濟方面之價値甚大，故益增其國防地位之重要，在此外蒙軍侵我新疆之際，深望國人注意及之。</p>
<h3>鄧文儀談北方軍情</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕軍聞社訊：最近赴東北，華北一帶視察歸來之鄧文儀談：（一）東北剿匪軍事情勢，自共匪發動五次攻勢先後失敗以來，共匪實力已遠不如前，因其精銳及幹部損傷甚衆，其總兵力雖號　近三十萬、但能使用於戰塲云，不過半數而已。所謂第六次攻勢，或難於最近發動，即發動亦將遭遇更嚴重之挫敗而國軍方面，由於山東戰事已獲澈底勝利，國軍陸續出關增援，實力倍增，同時，由於國府下令總動員，從此師出有名，人心歸順，國軍待遇自八月份起提高，東北行轅改組，厲行整肅軍紀，如是軍威士氣為之大振，以現勢觀察，稍駁時日，東北勦匪不難繼山東勦匪而獲得決定性勝利。（二）北方軍事情勢，近兩月來亦已改觀，劉伯誠匪主力已遠離河北，且巳大部被國軍殲滅。陳毅殘匪雖有一部逃竄黃河以北，但爲强弩之末，最近國軍已將平津保三角地帶匪衆掃盪。　榮臻匪衆雖尙號稱有十萬人，但其主力在平漢北段保定，石門週圍，實力僅三個縱隊，約五至六萬人，東逃西竄，企圖逃避國軍包圍，俟國軍主力集中，彼將不免再蹈去年十月左右在集寗與張家口慘敗覆轍。（三）華北政治，經濟及社會情形，已較數月前進步，穩定物價，漲風已不如前此急劇，人心亦較安定，山東國軍勝利與東北軍事穩定，影響華北甚大。</p>

<h3>文化界戡亂救國會　斥尾巴份子謬論　新蒂國主義以共匪作侵略工具　戡亂實是一種革命工作</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕中國文化界議亂救國總動員會，爲駁斥共匪尾巴份子謬論，發表宣言。首說明該會組織的理由，是要以動員文化工作者，動負人力物力，以完成戡亂救國的大業。繼指出文化界中有一些人，在報紙和刋物上，反對其所謂內戰，而呼籲其所謂和平，謂他們以中立份子自居，藉口民主自由，視戡亂爲內亂和黨爭，大做其反宣傳。</p>
<p>這些謬論</p>
<p>更是文化動員和戡亂救國總動員中十分不幸的事。該宣言續即以肅淸廖論，伸張正義之立塲，對阻撓戡亂救國總動員的反宣傳，加以闢斥：「誰也知道，舊帝國主義侵略中國，以軍閥爲工具，新帝國主義侵略中國，以共匪爲工具，所以共匪就是漢奸，戡亂所以救國，這怎能把戡亂指爲單純的內戰？老實說，戡亂是抵抗侵略，保障獨立的戰爭，而在消滅割據，鞏固統一，擁護憲法，完成民主，反對破壞，開展建設。各方面說來，戡亂又實在是一種革命工作，它不是五十幾年來的國民革命的最後一戰嗎？固然革命也是內戰，但絕不能與通常所謂內戰一概而論，其非黨爭，就很顯然了。有人以魏德邁特使指出人民需要和平的事實，來反對所謂內戰，不知需要和平爲一事，如何求得和平，又爲一事，而求得和平的方法，只有和平與戰爭，在和平方法失效時，除開戰爭，即無別的途徑。所以戰爭與和平，有相反相成之妙，而且在戡亂之時，呼籲和平，這就是說在五十幾年來的國民革命的最後一戰時，呼籲和平，實爲一種</p>
<p>反動行為</p>
<p>是的，所謂：「反對內戰」，實際上就是爲侵略割據破壞張目，阻撓行憲，而與獨立統一民主建設作對，這就顯然站在共匪漢奸方面去了，又怎能說是中立？共匪漢奸在其所謂「解放區」內，大呌動員，而在政府統治之卞，則「反對內戰」，其意即是只許共匪漢奸作亂賣國，不許政府戡亂救國，所以僅在政府統治之下「反對內亂」，實在是共匪漢奸的尾巴，第五縱隊的第五縱隊，這絕非甚麼中立份子，不過僞裝中立的份子而已。共匪漢奸持其暴力甘作鷹犬，務爲騷亂，毫無和平合法政黨之氣味，這是不能處以寬宏與以自由的。尤其要明白：言論自由，不能作扁袒共匪漢奸的護符，而反暴動，反漢奸，反騷亂的戡亂則爲民主所需要，這是很重要的一點。凡此種種，不可以說明文化界中，那班以</p>
<p>中立份子</p>
<p>自居，而藉口民主自由，以視戡亂爲內戰和然爭，而呼籲其所謂和平的人之錯誤嗎？我們希望他們對於戡亂救國總動員，有所認識，有所努力，否則全體文化界不能容忍，全體人民也是不能容忍的』。最後，該宣言呼籲各地文化界，就近注視共匪漢奸的尾巴，而糾正其謬論。並稱：政府旣然通過了戡亂救國總動員案，亦不能沒有責任。共匪漢奸對政府旣在前方以兵戎相見，政府又怎麽容許其尾巴在後方來爲共匪漢奸工作，以破壞戡亂救國總動員呢？</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美國外交與聯合國機構</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統於本月五日向巴西參衆兩院發表演說，指出戰後世界和平問題之困難、較一般人所預料者爲尤甚；但相信必能解決；並謂聯合國機構，實爲世界爲其共同之科平與福利而够力之結合，雖已遭遇各種困難，但美國決不因此而灰心，美國決以其所有之資源，擁護聯合國機構，務使其完成其任務。杜魯門總統的這一段話，本來是老生常談，我們從一般外交家的口中，早已耳熟能詳，並不包有任何新頴因素；但是在國際局勢動盪不定的今日，聯合國機構一再遭遇到嚴重的考騐，其對於維持世界和平促進人類幸福的功效究竟如何，迄今還是一個疑問；杜魯門總統適於此時，發表演說，籲請世界各國一致擁護聯合國機構，實含有特殊的意義，尤其値得我們的重視。</p>
<p>聯合國第二屆大會定於本月十六日在成功湖開幕，將討論安全理事會常任理事國應否享有否決權一項問題，這個問題不僅牽涉及聯合國憲章的修改問題，而且對於聯合國機構的眞正功效，也有莫大的關係，世界各國對於這次聯合國大會，都非常重視，故我國外長王世杰氏也親自率領了代表團前往成功湖，參加聯合國大會，日昨自京來滬，並曾向報界發表談話，對於聯合國機構，也率直表明中國的立塲與態度，其言有曰「中國政府對於目前修改憲章之可能性，雖不無懷疑，然對於憲章中否決權之合理解釋，因以限制其使用，則準備充分尊重大會多數意見。當舊金山會議於一九四五年通過聯合國　章之時，召開該會議之中·美·英·蘇四國，曾就此事發表共同解釋，遇必要時，中國政府並擬對於變更該項解釋之建談，予以贊助。』由此可知，中國政府對於聯合國機構，不僅能始終擁護到底，而且能隨時尊重聯合國大會大多數國家的意見，修改憲章或另作解釋。所以中國以全力擁護聯合國機構，是沒有問題的；但今日的問題，却在聯合國機構要不要使擁護者大失所望？</p>
<p>美國竭誠希望聯合國機構能盡其職責，並以全力擁護使其成爲維持世界和平最有效的機構，這是誰也不能表示懷疑的。不過在美國的政策上及共意向上，仍不免有錯誤之點，足以鑄成未來的大錯，所以我們不能不明自指出，以供美國外交當局的參考，並盼望其能够反躬自省，隨時加以改正。</p>
<p>聯合國機構誕生於大戰行將結束之際，當時有遠見的政治外交家，早就看到聯合國欲贏得軍事上的勝利，並不是一件難事；但至大戰結束之後，立即就能締造世界和平，却是一件最艱難的工作，因此就在大戰尙未結束的時候，就在舊金山舉行會議，通過一部聯合國憲章，作爲職後締造世界和平的張本。殊不料迨至大戰吿終之後，聯合國大會雖一再在倫敦紐的開會，但迄未能發生聯合國機構的功效。對義·羅·匈·芬·保·五國和約，雖已簽字成功，但對德奧兩國和約，迄未起草成功，甚至對日和約，尙未開始起草，不免使仳人發生和平更加渺茫的感覺。美國不論爲其本身的利害打算，　　爲其對於世界和平所負的責任計，都應該加緊努力，扶持聯合國機構，促成和平的實現，這次泛美會議，在美國主持之下，卒使西半球共同防衛協定得以成立，西半球的和平與安全，業已因此而獲得一重保障，不能不認為美國外交的一大成功。但是在現行國際關係之下，不論是和平或是戰爭，都是不可分割的；美國僅能做到獨善其身的辦法，或僅能使西半球的和平與安全獲得保障，而歐洲或遠東的和平與安全，若無保障，則美國仍無和平可言，聯合國機構也不能發揮其功效。我們相信美國外交當局對於目前的世界大勢，一定看得非常淸楚。不要說今日的歐洲，仍在動亂之中，，就是今日的亞洲，也潛伏着種種可怕的因紫，足爲今後國際的亂源。但是從美國的外交措施上看來，美國仍不脫「歐洲第一，遠東其次」的作風。杜魯門主義早已行之於歐洲，不惜鉅款協助希臘土耳其，抵抗外來勢力的侵入，大規模的援歐計劃，不久也將見諸事實；但是美國對於遠東，仍在徨彷，不知何去何從？雖知遠東局勢的嚴重性，不亞於歐洲，但終覺得有所顧忌，不肯將杜魯門主義推行及遠東，甚至美國國內還有一部份目光如豆的人，主張扶持戰敗國，作爲遠東的安定力。這種錯誤的觀念，不僅足以貽誤遠東各國，而且美國將來也終不免自食其惡果！</p>
<p>要之，曰下美國雖竭力促成聯合國機構的功能，但從其所施行的外交政策看來，頗多與其原意背道而馳的地方；我們爲遠東的和平計，同時也爲聯合國機構的前途計，不能不指出美國外交政策的錯誤，並希望美國外交政策早日改絃更　！</p>

<h3>美建議四強會商韓政局　蘇政府拒不接受　並責美方分設臨時議會亦不同意</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科七日電〕塔斯社今日發表蘇聯政府聲明，完全拒絕美國建議，由美蘇中英四國討論朝鮮問題，對於朝鮮南北兩部分別設立臨時議會一層，亦不同意。蘇聯致美覆文係於本月四日以莫洛托夫外長名議提出，內稱：美蘇混合委員會尙未智窮力竭，美國向英中蘇建議舉行四國會議討論朝鮮問題係出於片面行動。該覆文並重述蘇聯見解，以爲美蘇混合委員會未能成立協議，其咎在於美方代表。美國建議僅足以加强朝鮮南北兩部之分裂，當前關鍵則須由朝鮮全部民主份子組織臨時統一政府。</p>

<p>〔路透社七日電〕越督波拉爾定星期三夜在西貢電臺代表法政府向越盟提出法國之和平建議，其中有重大之讓步，計有下列數端：（一）接受胡志明前此要求之於簽訂和平一年後，由法國准許越盟完全獨立；（二）撇回前此否認越盟有脫離法國聯盟之權之聲明；（三）完全免除越盟向法賠償損失之義務；（四）釋放全部越盟政治犯。</p>
<p>據悉胡志明之代表已飛往香港晤越督之代表，數月以來早日恢復和平之希望，未有更濃於此次者。胡志明對法方建議可能的反響，雖尙未有透露，然此間越盟地下人員，則料越盟電台可於週四宣布胡志明之接受，故停戰協定或可於週末即行簽字。</p>
<p>〔路透社香港七日電〕越督波拉爾即將對越盟廣播法國和平建議之前夕，香港已成雙方談判之中心。據悉越盟要員三人以及越督波拉爾之代表均於今日抵港，彼等於明日即將與前安南皇帝保大開始談判。</p>

<h3>下屆遠經會十一月在菲舉行</h3>
<p>〔路透社馬尼刺七日電〕聯合國亞洲及遠東經濟委會之下屆會議，暫定於十一月十五日菲律賓普選之後，在菲島之巴基沃召開。會期議定兩週，討論事項有東方各國之需要。其主要物品及建設材料之缺乏。貿易之促進，財政及放款以及工業之發展等問題。會中成立之決議案，將向聯合國經社理事會提出作爲建議案。犬會主席一職，或將由菲財長桂台諾當選，菲政府對會塲之佈置，已在積極籌備中。</p>
<h3>英法澳減少輸入美工業蒙受影響</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦六日電〕據今日調查，新近英·法·澳洲決定减少輸入，美國工業因此喪失之交易不下十億美元。三國決定停購之貨物均極急需，但因美元供應減少，不得保存作購買必需品之美元。法國決定於此後六個月內節省二億五千萬美元，澳洲決定每年減少輸入四千萬美元。此項節省大部份係在美國方面，惟較小之金元國家，亦將感受影響，加拿大尤甚。</p>
<h3>分配黃金建議　美反應冷淡</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕英外相貝文提議，美國應重行分配諾克斯堡黃金，今日雖有新鮮事，但仍未改變美國對此項建議之冷淡態度。據倫敦方面稱，貝氏　論係欲美國提高其鉅額存金之美元價値，俾可藉此「盈餘」用以援歐，毋須直接增加美國納稅人之負祖。政府方面謂此乃請美國借款城送禮之另一請柬。美國財長史奈特新近黨否認有改變黃金價格每盎斯三十五美元之意，故財部對此必將竭力反對。無論如何改變金價須經國會通過，目前國會方面並無此種意向。</p>
<h3>為避免付出更大代價　美必須加速援歐</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕國務院業於六日同意加速實行馬歇爾之援歐計劃。國務院國際貿易政策司代理司長尼資今夜廣播國務院之聲明稱：「吾人相信關於馬歇爾計劃之時間表，必須予以提早，使歐洲得於今年年底以前獲得援助」。</p>
<p>尼氏復謂許多歐洲國家，若英·法·義等均已處於嚴重局勢之下。尼氏雖未說明須召開國會特別會以提早援歐，但曰「國會預定須於明年一月始能復會，故在春季以前難望得有行動。然歐洲國家如於今冬不能輸入煤斤及糧食，則局勢必趨危殆。」尼氏復力言美國決盡力以援助歐洲，自道義觀點而論，美國不能僅因他國之無錢購置復興材料，而坐視其陷入崩潰狀態，或坐視其人民餓以待斃。自經濟觀點而觀，美國亦不能坐視龐大之生產機構祗因資本之缺乏而趨於破毀，自政治觀點而論，美國亦不能容許右傾或左傾的獨裁制度，在缺乏援助的局勢下長成。總之，美國之拒不援助，實較給予援助更須耗費較多之代價。</p>
<p>〔合衆社底德律七日電〕美國工業組織大會之汽車工人大會會長路塞氏七日要求杜魯門總統召集國會特別會議，並提議立即恢復管制糧食及其他主要物品之價格。路塞致總統之函內警吿稱：若國會召集特別會議以加緊對歐洲經濟危機之行動，則亦必須對「國內經濟危機」有所行動。</p>
<h3>法將向美國進出口銀行　再申請新借款五億美元　法減少麵包配給全境騷然</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕消息靈通人士今日稱，法國駐美大使龐萊定下星期返任，內閣已命其向美國進出口銀行申請借款五億美元，勉渡難關，以待馬歇爾援歐計劃生效。此爲數月來法國向進出口銀行第二次申請貸款，第一次申請五億美元，結果獲得二億五千萬美元。法國需款購買糧食，汽油與小麥。麵包配給又减少兩啢，全境騷然。昨日有工人十五萬名在巴黎遊行，反對减少麵包配給，高喊「賴瑪迪辭職』，「賴瑪迪上斷頭台」之口號。同時，賴瑪迪總理昨日在衆議院獲得信任票，聞正草擬廣大之行政，財政與預算案，整頓內部。</p>
<h3>諾克斯堡金庫　庫門重逾四萬磅藏金一萬二千噸</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛領六日電〕英外相貝文最近突然提議，美國應重行分配諾克斯蕯黃金，此世界最大之資金儲　已因此復見於　　新聞中。究竟貝文之意何在，此計劃將如何執行及有何利益，此爲一大秘密。記者與另一聯合社訪員曾與美國財政部人員及私人經濟家談話數小時，寬無一人確知貝文之命意。惟人民對於鏗德基州一萬二千噸金條之大量儲藏，已因員氏掦議而重復引起其好奇心，實則諾克斯堡黃金僅爲美國存金之一部份。世界各國用作紙幣準備金之黃金總值，約爲美金三百八十億元，其中二百十八億元爲美國所有。而堆藏在諾克斯堡一座守衛嚴密之庫房中者，約偵一百廿五億元。此項黃金均係鎔成金磗，每塊長僅六吋，重量在廿七磅半左右，約計有八十二萬九千塊堆存其中。庫房分上下兩層，一在地下，一在地面。庫房之門重逾四萬磅。美政府在一九四六年因存金過多，始建此庫備藏。</p>
<h3>杜魯門在巴西　郊遊受虛驚　乘車脫輻離懸崖僅咫尺</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴西京城六日電〕杜魯門總統訪問巴西，已歷六日，即將啓程返美，今日偕同行數人，乘白宮黑色大敞車登山，赴巴西商人豐德斯家午餐，途中車輪突然滑卸，幾遭不測。惟杜魯門仍聲色不動，笑請新聞記者及攝影師協助將汽車推回，以便繼續進行。記者見車之左後輪擱在邊石上，距懸崖祗有二呎，可謂險極。</p>
<h3>東歐各國政局撲朔迷離　英美政策不一致　美嫌英對蘇政策綏靖色彩過濃</h3>
<p>〔合眾社維也納六日電〕合眾社記者羅伯茲報稱：外交觀察家發覺英美對東歐各國政策之歧見，日益加深，致蘇聯大可利用此裂痕，以發展其自巴爾幹至波羅的海之計劃。數週來，駐奧匈保三國境內之英美外交人員互作無情之指摘。</p>
<p>記者在東歐六週間，曾與英美外交官員屢次晤談，結果獲得一印象，即英人以爲美人常有不負責任之舉動，而美方則感覺英國對蘇政策，綏靖政策過份濃厚。英方對美國政治軍事代表中，常有人討論對蘇戰爭不可避免一點，特別表示不滿。在東歐即將開戰之謠諑日有所傳，保守人士尤其渴望美國起而「阻止」蘇聯。保加利亞反對黨魁彼得柯夫被判死刑後，保京索菲亞即盛傳美國將於一週內侵保。英代表除抗議匈選舉舞弊及彼得柯夫處死之不當外，即不作第二步之表示。英國非官方人士估計，大選舞弊票尙未超過二十萬票，實力不足以改變結果，維也納傳稱，英美已停止交換政治情報，特別有關自蘇聯控制各國逃出難民之情報。英美意見分歧表面跡象，厥為共黨羽翼下之各國對英態度較前熱切，英國亦希望能與此數國迅速建立貿易關係。</p>
<h3>日戰犯審訊將入新階段</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京七日電〕盟軍審訊東條英機及其廿四名戰爭共犯，可能於本週，最可能於下週進入一新階段，各戰犯將個別爲其本人辯護。此階段開始前，尙須待遠東國際法庭庭長魏勃規定每一戰犯在證人席陳述之時間。此間預測稱，每人然有三日至一星期之時限，如以三日爲限，全程尙須費時十餘星期，而時序已進入十二月。魏勃及法庭審判官均力求戰犯能有公平而迅速之審判，故法庭將盡力在聖庭節前完成審訊。戰犯辯陳之次序，恐將以英文字母排列，故東條將爲自我辯護之最後第二人。被吿自辯結束後，檢察官將反駁被吿方面所提之證據，被吿律師或有機會再予反駁，然一般以為此事不甚可能。兩方然後再以全體盤簡略陳報庭上，因審訊中無陪審員，故庭上不必再作簡略總報告。</p>
<h3>國際統計會議今在華府開幕</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕來目五十六國（其中包括中國）之代表五百餘人，今聚集於此，參加於八日在此間開幕之國際統計會議。我國代表團長爲朱君毅，團員爲金國實陳達，此會主旨係在謀取國際統計及標準發展，據朱君對中央社記者談稱，鑒於此次會議將討論中國本身即擬舉辦之人口調査及國際收入調査，故此次會議將對中國眞有特別意義。</p>
<h3>領事團監督印荷停戰　五國派軍官協助　印尼首都防守司令易人</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞六日電〕據可靠消息：聯合國領事團若干團員，今日已接獲本國政府訓令，加速佈置荷屬東印度之停戰監督事宜，該團奉命於本月二十日以前向聯合國安理會提出報吿。領事團團長即美代表福特召集各代表，於七日晚開會，聞福氏已獲得官方證實，美軍官將自馬尼刺與東京前來協助監督停戰。</p>
<p>某方稱，領事調査團之六國每國將派出陸軍或海軍官八十名，以供技術援助。其中中英法澳可望派遣本國軍官，但比利時或將暫借美國軍人充任，因該國並無軍官留在亞洲大陸。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞七日電〕印尼共和國國務部長兼日惹酋長飽　諾，據報將繼陸軍參謀總長蘇摩哈拉卓爲日惹城防司令，使以前謠傳鮑沃諾擬宣佈日惹爲不設防城市之說得以證實。印尼方面最近宣稱，共和國首都將遷往蘇門答臘西岸婆的丁集地方。</p>

<h3>希臘合內閣成立　人民黨卒取得陸長要職　美特使完成任務已啟程返國</h3>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎七日電〕法警察局方面宣佈：猶太法師一名及兩史脫恩地下組織黨員兩名，由於與陰謀空襲倫敦案有關，業已加以逮捕。據警署稱：該法師企圖向倫敦自空中散發傳單，而史脫恩黨員則擬轟炸倫敦，以爲一九四七年重返漢堡猶太難民報仇。該法師名考爾夫，為巴勒斯坦政治行動委員會主席。渠在法國凡爾賽附近私人機塲準備登私人飛機赴倫敦時被捕。警署稱：該機中裝滿藏有宣傳品之文件箱，準備至倫敦散發。宣傳品上署有「解放依色列人戰士」之名，內稱，「吾人今日爲自由解放而戰，以免明日爲奴隸解放而戰」。該兩史脫恩黨黨員祗知其姓名爲耶格斯及奧爾加，在同一時期於巴黎某公寓中被捕。據警署稱，渠等於其公寓中發現六顆自製之炸彈。又悉，耶格斯及奧爾加兩人曾僱用飛機，擬飛往倫敦投彈。</p>

<p>卅區區發代表會招待首長　對大選提供意見　希望公開明朗樹立良好風氣　擁護總動員令決以事實表現</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市三十區區民代表會主席，昨日下午六時，在新生活俱樂部，招待本市地方首長及新聞界，一方面對地方長官表示敬意，一方面對國家大選事提供意見。到吳市長代表民政局長張曉崧，潘議長公展，方主委洽，査院長良鑑，杜月笙代表唐世昌，市參會項秘書長昌權及區民代表會主席，各區調解委員會主席等約七十人。該會爲酬謝各長官爲地方服務之勞績，特以「中庸舜頌紀念册」，分別贈獻吳市長，潘議長，宣司令，方主委，査院長，嚴監察使，及杜理事長。席間並由老閘區區民代表會主席劉協勛致歡迎詞，新成區任矜蘋致頌詞。</p>
<p>自力更生·勿求外助</p>
<p>繼由聯合會總幹事黃浦區江兆虎說明此次招待會之意見數點：（甲）在競選立法委員及國大代表時，希望：（一）樹立良好風氣，並響應節約，對於利用請客等任何行賄方式均須予以拒絕。（二）競選應公開明朗化，當向區民公開演講，並使人民對政治有確切認識。（三）參加者應將本人過去政績詳細說明，勿僅報吿履歷。（四）希望智識份子及有資格被選者多多參加。（乙）魏德邁特使此次來華，根本未與眞正民衆代表接觸，即對我國人民加以批評，似不合理，渠所搜集資料雖多，但都屬吿洋狀者之個人申訴，故區民代表會必須表示數點意見：（一）我們並不希望向美國討錢，美國帮助中國應爲道義之助，借款應勿損害中國之主權。（二）美國遠東政策顯係放棄中國，抓住日本，此種現象必將蹈珍珠港事變覆轍。我國人民務須自力更生，勿依賴外力。</p>
<p>上下團結·達到繁榮</p>
<p>（三）擁護總動員令。（四）我們本身必須下決心，以事實表現，答覆別人批評，一方面要檢舉貪汚，並請上海長官領導予以精神反擊，人民之合作，須視長官之是否合作。（丙）關於直轄市地方自治，政府頗不加重視，必須力爭，地方自治應以城市開始，而非以鄕縣爲始，實行憲政，亦當由下做去，區民代表會應作爲法人。</p>
<p>旋由方主委致詞，略謂：本人來滬已有十一月，但未曾爲上海市民及人民代表盡力，甚覺慚愧，但相信同人等已盡最大努力，今後希望各代表多加鞭策，上下整個團結，以達本市繁榮之境。對魏德邁之判斷，本人認爲由於認識不足，接觸人民太少，中國事必須中國人自了。對於提競供選意見，決予接受。</p>
<p>參會希望·交換意見</p>
<p>後由潘議長致詞略稱：直轄市地方自治，憲法上僅以「另以法律定之」一語規定，對其地位殊未加以確定，且產生之代表名額又少，市參議會自治委員會已將中央發表之省縣，直轄市及普通市自治通則草案印就整理，將於本屆大會討論，希望區民代表會提供意見。</p>
<p>關於魏德邁調査團來華調査結果發表聲明，的確感到遺憾。本屆市參議會大會即將舉行，希望區民代表在開會前儘量與本會交換意見，俾市政建設發揚光大。</p>
<h3>本市各機帆船公司　被拒加入輪船公會　聯名具呈社局　請求予以糾正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市機帆船（即柴油機輪），在勝利後，各輪公司尙未復員復航時，活躍於長江沿海，總計約有二三百艘。迨各輸復航後，逐漸改航，至今尙存百餘艘，正式設立公司船行者約七十餘家，數月前向輪船商業同業公會申請加入爲會員，經該會擱置數月，嗣於七月二十八日復稱：經第二十四次理監事聯席會議決，凡機帆船及輪船總噸位在二百噸以下，眞實馬力在二百匹以下者，毋庸加人該會等語。</p>
<p>各機帆船行家對公會拒絕加入，認爲殊無充分理由，乃於上月二十日由威利船務行，四通船務行，振興仁船務行等七十家，且呈社會局，陳述公會處置不當之理由五點，請求予以糾正。大意謂：機帆船與輪船並無二致，根據海商法與輪船法規定，與主管交通部及航政局核發輪船業執照各項證照處置辦法，顯然相同。該會限制總噸位二百噸，馬力二百匹以下之決談，毫無根據，旦與法不符。即就會章而論，並無上述限制之規定，今僅根據理監事之決議，而修改會章，實屬與法不合。會員中原有同樣資格之會員多家，並有一部份會員純係代理行，根本無自置輪船者，反許入會，而機帆船公司雖與各大輪船公司不同，但其經營業務，並無二致，且參加公會，對於同業，亦無不利之處，何以竟加拒絕云云。</p>

<h3>綠礬原料　激增三倍　水要漲價　正研究中　浦東電廠要求貼補</h3>
<p>新外匯管制辦法實施後，汽油柴油等液體燃料，中樞規定不能再以官價結匯，故液體燃料價格激增。茲悉：本市浦東電氣公司，前以官價外匯所購得之柴油，業已用罄，於本月初起，所用之柴油，進價提高，致成本加重，虧損過鉅，已感不勝負担，乃於日前具呈市公用局，請求對虧損部份，予以貼補。茲據公用局長趙曾玨吿記者稱：該公司要求貼補事，當先行着手調査其消耗油量，再行決定，配以官價燃油，或予補貼。又悉：如自來水公司現正紛向公用局要求即予調整售價，因各公司所所需之原料，以綠礬爲主，但綠礬不准申請官價外匯，而市價業已猛漲三倍許，故對自來水現行售價，實難維持，市公用局對此問題，亦正硏究中。</p>

<h3>防癆主要在隔離　本報第廿三次星期特別廣播　公濟醫院朱院長講詞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨假座東方華美電台，舉辦第廿三次星期特別廣播，請公濟醫院院長朱仰高（見圖）博士播講：「防癆我見」。茲紀錄其講詞六意於後：</p>
<p>「肺結核是世界上最殘酷的疾病，人類的勁敵，無論什麽疾病，都沒有像肺結核使我們當醫生的人如此感覺困難的。外國情形及我國整個情形暫且不談，即以上海一隅而論，可以說隨便那一種職業部門中都有患肺結核病的人在工作，假如患結核病者不傳染別人，問題還不嚴重，可以緩　的設法解決，無如患肺結核病的人，他的一呼一吸，經過空氣的媒介，傳染給他的朋友，他的左右親近的人，在不知不覺當中，不獨害了自己，還要害了親戚朋友，這是多麽嚴重的問題。所以防癆工作，主要的就是把許多患有肺結核嫌疑的人。加以檢査，如確係患着肺結核病，應該和他的親戚朋友隔離開來，不至於傳染給別人，這是防癆的第一步工作。</p>
<p>兩種檢查</p>
<p>一般檢查大槪分兩種，（一）X光檢查，（二）痰液檢査。X光檢査，僅能透視肺中有無病狀，對於咳痰中有無細菌，尙須進一步檢査痰液。也有許多輕微的肺病患者，痰液中無結核細菌存在、此種人無傳染別人危險，尙可不需隔離，假如痰液檢査結果、確有細菌，則此種人非立即予以隔離不可。然此種方法亦有困難，即檢査痰液中有結核菌之病人，隔離以後，如何善後的問題。有若干肺結核患者，非不知自己之病可以傳染別人，但爲生活問題，不得不掩飾自己的病狀，勉强工作。醫生囑以須靜養，與社會隔離，則家庭方面生活首先發生問題。如何能安心養病，此爲事實上的困難。</p>
<p>保障生活</p>
<p>關於此點，則不屬於醫師責任範圍之內，醫師的責任，』僅在發現病因，治療病症，至於進一步牽涉社會問題，則需社會上各界人士通力合作，譬如各機關·團體·工廠·商號·如發覺其中職員有患肺結核者，一方面勸其積極治療，勿因循自誤，一方面須對其家庭生活，有一妥善處置，俾不致因養病而失業，因失業而影響其家庭生活。蓋防癆之主要工作爲使患者與健康人羣隔離，不至擴大傳播，惟一經隔離，則不能生產，如無法以善其後，病者仍不能安心療養，勢必支持病體，勉强工作，結果仍傳染他人。故各機關，團體，工廠，商號首長，對於患結核病的職工，在治療期間予以生活上之保障，乃爲防癆有效之前提。此　非醫師力所能及，今藉此機會促起各界注意，以發揮人類互助之精神。</p>
<p>切勿畏懼</p>
<p>至於醫藥界方面，對肺結核之研究，日新月異，患者如及早治療，幷非絕望之症，深望患肺結核者在心理上勿恐怖畏懼，撲滅肺結核雖不敢說有十分把握，果能各界人士聯合一致，決心撲滅，一定能達到目的。今將防癆之主要工作在隔離一點，提供於各界人士之前，希望大家眞心誠意，與肺結核菌宣戰，不達勝利之目的不止。</p>

<h3>滬東絲織廠工潮　今晨商處理辦法　二區三區工會防止蔓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬東二十餘家絲織廠職工，昨日仍繼續罷工。四區絲織業產業工會，除竭力勸導復工外，並定於今晨九時召開各廠代表會議，商討處理辦法。前日各廠職工停工時，工會方面事前並無所知，聞訊後即緊急通知各廠工人照常工作，唯工人昨日仍未復工。</p>
<p>二區（滬南）三區（滬西）絲織業產業工會雖對勞資評斷委員會決定之工資折扣辦法，感覺不滿，但表示在未接奉評斷會通知以前，各廠工人仍照常生產。一面爲預防工潮之蔓延，已作適常準備。工會並望當局對工資折扣辦法失當之處，能予修正改善。</p>
<p>社會局與總工會對此次滬東一部份絲織廠工人之突然罷工甚爲注意，已派員調査。</p>
<p>據一部資方表示，此次勞資評斷會決定之工資折扣辦法對職工頗爲有利，因絲織業）目前之艱困，及不能維持情形，確爲實情。此次滬東一部份工廠工人之突然罷工，係猜想資方對該項工資折扣辦法尙不能負祖，故先予「示威」，表示工人對該項辦法亦不能滿意云。</p>

<h3>留聲機唱片業　走向沒落邊緣　收音機替代了他的地位　產銷商計劃着兼營副業</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕十年前，上海留聲機與唱片業的黃金時代，已成過云，主顧們愈來愈少，機片商們對着堆積着銷售不了的產品發愁，聰明些的商家，都在計劃或已開始兼營電料，收音機，或其他的副業。</p>
<p>今天，無綫電收音機已經代替了留聲機片的位置，留聲機便走近了沒落的邊緣。</p>
<p>每月灌片兩三萬張</p>
<p>在上海製造留聲機的昌明，德成兩廠，前者以製造自鳴鐘爲正業，後者以電燈電料爲副業，這樣還可勉强幫助着維持留聲機的生產；灌製唱片的百代，大中華兩家公司，除了爲他們自己的產品之外，前者並接受勝利，商亭，蓓開三家的委託，後者並接受百歌，峨嵋，星月三家的委託，　發唱片。現在各界每月灌片的決數在兩萬張到三萬張，僅上戰前每月灌製數目的五分之一。這兩三萬張的數目，分配給寳芳，心聲，大聲，天聲，百聲，歌聲，及四大公司等十家作爲零售。據說，這可憐的數目，每月有很多存貨不能脫售。</p>
<p>銷數銳减僅五之一</p>
<p>戰前外國入口的唱片，都由百代公司代爲經理，美國的哥倫比亞公司，英國的勝利公司，在中國尤其是在上海，也有相當的銷路，現在可說完全沒有來貨。這不是限止入口的關係，而是願意購置留聲機片的人减少了。</p>
<p>談到機片的銷路，以前除了京滬及江南各地的零售是大宗之外，華北·平津·武漢·四川·河南·陜西·濟南·廣東·香港乃至於南洋各地的批發生意，都很普遍，可是這些批發生意，也說　到只占戰前的五分之一，京滬一帶的零售數目是很小的。</p>
<p>成本太高也是主因</p>
<p>製片業的困難，第一是交通未恢復，成品不能大量行銷外埠，次是地方性唱片發達，不能普遍行銷，至於灌製的成本太高，也是個主要原因。除掉所需的各項材料及人工不說，單祗版權一項，以前梅博士與馬連良合灌一張「打漁殺家」的唱片是一千元，現在如要灌製一張平劇名角唱片，前兩個月的代價，約在一千萬元以上，還要附送幾十張唱片。所以目前歌曲唱片流行，是因爲灌片的代價較低，沒有平劇或其他地方劇的名角的拘束。但是流行歌曲的壽命短，風行一時的歌曲，隨時有新的譜曲出現，舊唱片祗好堆到貨架上，讓它給塵封着了。</p>
<p>我聽到了留聲機與唱片業的嘆息之聲！</p>
<h3>滬南車輛輪渡　國慶日可通航</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬南軍輛輪渡工程，經市輪渡公司負責推進以來，成績尙屬良好，據該公司負責人稱：若無一風雨停工，罷工或其他意外，則十月十日當可通航。浦東方面之打樁引橋工程，業已全部完成。鋼橋及起重架即可安裝。浮橋下載重方舟，本月底可裝就。至於浦西之疏浚，亦早已完工，其引橋工程，限於本月十日之前完成之。據悉：全部工程完成後，其運輸功能，初期恐難望充分發揮。現該公司決絡續加以改進，其目標決定如下：（一）渡輪用登陸艇改造爲過渡性質，將來必須特殊設計，而以採用兩端行駛者。（二）起重機現採卡車，賴人力轉動，將來須改機動。（二）兩岸馭岸均甚單薄，將來應改建加深，以便疏濬而利航行。（四）浦東道路須繼續完成之。</p>
<h3>申報助學金　盼慷慨解囊　統計各校淸寒學子　待援者數逾四千人</h3>
<p>爲了調查和統計本市家境淸寒無力入學亟待援助的窮苦學生的人數起見，在一個星期以前，我們向全市各大中學寄出了近二百份的「學校概况調査表」，請各校給我們塡報，因爲這種調査工作，能够使我們決定受助名額及助學金的預算，以便工作的開展。</p>
<p>由於全市各大中學的熱忱協助，這件複雜的調查工作快將完成，到今天爲止，已經有五分之四的「調查表」重行寄回到我們的手中，我們把它分類，整理，最後我們得到了一個驚人的結果，這結果告訴我們全市需要本報援助的學生人數，至少在四千人以上，這數字昭示在我們面前，是鐵一般的事實，假使每人平均給予七十萬元的助學金，總數要廿八億元，但我們只預備核准一千五百名，就需要十億五千萬元呢。</p>
<p>本報「讀者助學金」開始勸募以來，已整整的十六天了，已收到捐款的數額，還只有四千多萬，加上本館自認的三億元外，離開十億五千萬元的目標，還差上一段很長的距離。事實上這些數目，確是無游泳是於事的。</p>
<p>上面的數字明白的吿訴我們，也同時吿訴社會人士，「讀者助學金」未來的效能，還有待大家的努力，這努力將給無數的窮苦學生帶來光明的前途！</p>

<h3>建設東北好環境　作根本救治工作　陳兼主任蒞任一席談</h3>
<p>馬愚忱氏說：熊式輝係內科大夫，請陳兼主任爲外科大夫，對東北惡瘤開刀！</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽七日電〕陳兼主任昨招待民產機構代表茶會時，馬愚忱致詞，謂：熊式輝係內科大人，請陳兼主任爲外科大夫，對東北惡瘤開刀，大家可爲親屬，簽字信任！</p>
<p>陳兼主任謂：將接受人民意見，改東北特殊化爲正常化，希望地方人士負起責任來，爲補救十四年缺陷。陳兼主任又謂：本人將本蔣主席意旨，使東北成一個三民主義實騐區。</p>
<p>陳兼主任又謂：大家希望我對貪汚等事開刀，我將以建設好環境作根本之救治，當開刀者必開刀，但壞人究竟少，千萬不要中了共產黨分化奸計。</p>

<h3>將軍一到瀋陽　東北人心開朗</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽三日航訊〕九月一日，是我們記者的節日，是在連綿陰雨後出現的一個東方色彩的老晴天。這天，我們愉快，又忙碌，以致無暇想到過節的事，潘市的外勤記者，已被陳總長蒞瀋的消息吸引到北陵機塲了。</p>
<p>小女孩子獻花</p>
<p>下午兩句鐘「追靈號」專機的銀翼緩緩降落，機門啓處，陳總長含笑下機，與熊主任寒暄，接受一個小女孩子的獻化，頻呼「謝謝」不已。他與年近花甲的東北元老張作相，，王樹翰握手時，連說「不敢當，不敢當」。</p>
<p>陳兼主任與熊前主任同車往市內行轅第二招待所，沿途佇立歡迎的民衆和學生，從他們笑容可掬的臉上，看出了他們的爽郞的心情。</p>
<p>共匪發動五次攻勢前後，東北人心一度陷於苦悶之境，陳總長之蒞潘。使沉悶的人心爲之開郞，因爲一般人都知道陳總長的明快作風，希望他能大刀闊斧，對東北一切政治，軍事，經濟各方面，加以澈底的革新，來挽救東北的危機，滿足東北同胞的一切希望。</p>
<p>兼嫻軍事政治</p>
<p>東北局勢的變化，能前主任式輝說得明日：「過去東北行轅，乃以和平及外交方式來進行接收工作，故有政經兩委會之設立，兩年以還，形式巳經變化，不得不注重軍事」。熊主任兩年霄旰憂勤的努力及其所運用的和平外交，由於蘇聯的背信失約，而諸感棘手，共匪的勢力也乘機龐大。中央不能坐視東北的局勢日益惡化，因而不得不改變在東北的政策與作風，以謀挽救大局，所以改派嫻於軍事兼長政治的陳總長前來主持東北大計。陳總長在九月二日接事的一天便說：「東北的問題，不僅是中國安危的問題，而且是世界和平相關的問題」。</p>
<p>此間中央日報於陳總長蒞瀋之翌日，盛稱他爲「新階段的人物」，因爲他具有如剪刀的識力。如鐵的胆力，更有如鋼的自信力，如風的指揮力，他的廉潔與剛毅德性，爲全國靑年所景從，他的韜略與革命精神，爲黨內黨外所翕服。</p>
<p>國軍制敵機先</p>
<p>從東北軍事的加强，到政治的刷新，經濟的改革，脈絡一貫。我們可以看出，一切的軍事勝利爲前題，這也是陳兼主任蒞任前後所積極籌劃的，一般相信，東北戰事在九月中必然爆發，國軍將制敵機先，爭取主動。國軍之初步行動，將爲肅淸遼南及安東梅河口一帶共匪，然後沿中長路指師北上，直搗共匪之神經中樞哈爾濱，及兵工廠佳木斯，全面收復松北。（記者趙展）</p>

<h3>廬山拾零</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺五日航訊〕南潯鐵路通車後，昔日車輛雲飛之南潯公路上，頓呈荒凉之象，但是，沿途撿查登記的部隊，依然未减曩昔威風，短短一百九十公里的南潯道上，除了公路管理站，照例應該管制路上的行車外，保安團隊的檢查，實在給予旅客以無限痛苦，所謂護路部隊的檢查，除了他們自己要取得無票行車的方便外，對於路上的治安，實在沒收到預期的效果，因爲檢查自檢查，匪刼自匪刧，何况他們還要征收一筆無名的登記費，有一次王陵基主席車以途經張公波，護路隊的檢查站，强迫征收三千元的登記費，這才將此事揭破，飭令停辦。</p>
<p>張公渡，是南潯公路的中點，來往南潯的汽車，多在此中餐，昔日繁盛，不亞戰前，但是現在却鴉雀無聲，除了極少數的幾家小飯店，每天僥倖的能够賣幾杯開水或是一餐便飯之外，其他的舖子，都已關門。當地的老百姓，現在唯一的希望，是贛　公路通車，他們將繁榮的遠景，寄託在贛鄂道上，但是，這條路的修成，恐怕還需相當時日。</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>改革幣制問題之商榷</h3>
<p>最近曾盛傳政府擬向美國借款十億至二十億美元，用以改革幣制，以穩定金融。國內輿論界一致認爲，對症良藥，倘服用過平，不但不能愈病，而等到眞正需用時，反而無藥可用。此時改革幣制，因客觀條件未備，效果有限，尙嫌過早，宜俟一般經濟情况略見好轉，然後再作根本之圖。作者遠在日本，亦認爲此一問題與國民經濟關係重大，故就平時對於此一問題研究所得，提供若干意見，以供國人參攷。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以來，爲時已逾兩載，四方多難，民不聊生。默察國內情形，能不悲從中來。眼看東鄰，於戰敗之後、收拾餘燼，重新建設，政治經濟，大致已上軌道，國際貿易亦已於八月十五日起開放；以一億三千七百萬美元之存金作爲基金；實力已屬相當雄厚，加以美國朝野之精神提携，更覺左右逢源。日本人民眞是興高彩烈，抱有無限希望。我國與之昆鄞，宿寃未解，而又首當其衝。</p>
<p>我國現在的問題，概括的說，只有一個經濟問題，換言之，就是幣制問題。法幣爲政府信用所寄托，戰事結束以來，迄未定有具體的整理辦法，以至惡性膨脹，到了飽滿點，危象已見，崩潰可期。法幣的崩潰，便是政治經濟的總崩潰。倘不幸而竟至此無可收拾之境地，結果之悲慘，有不堪設想者。所以，倘有對症良藥，用正其時，稍一觀望，後悔莫及。所謂客觀條件，非至幣制之信用，重新建立，必不到來，蓋可斷言也。</p>
<p>欲重立法幣信用，必從改革幣制着手。現行法幣靈魂已失，無法挽救。果能以最大之勇氣，直捷了當，稱實際僅抵戰前三角之尤元票爲法幣三角，心理上必起異機之作用，而精神爲之一振。否則，徒見物價不斷上漲，神經天天在緊張中，陷入泥沼，無力自拔。今之鈔票亦猶昔之鈔票，名之爲三角，不覺物價之昂貴，生活之艱難，名之爲萬元，即不免有今日之紛擾。數字作崇，玩弄人類，爲害之烈，一至於是。</p>
<p>昔日之萬元現已貶値爲三角，其中九千九百九十九元七角全因民族抗戰而消耗。此項損失實際上已由全國人民共同分擔，掛此爛賬，徒然令人驚心怵目，何如一筆勾銷，反覺乾净痛快。但應注意者此剩餘之三角，務必以全力保全其價値，勿使再行跌落。保全之道，在改革幣制，重立法幣之信用。惟有若干問題，應加以檢討：</p>
<p>（一）新舊法幣之折合率由經濟專家，就舊幣之總發行額及其現有之購買力，以精密之計算方法算定之，不宜過高，亦不宜過低。比率旣定，乃進而估定新幣第一期之發行額及其應有之準備金。假定，其比率爲十萬對三者，如舊幣之發行額爲一百萬億元折合新幣僅爲三十億元，約合美金十億元。新幣之發行額大見减少，則籌措準備金自亦較易。</p>
<p>（二）新幣之發行，必須有與戰前同一標準之準備金，否則無以保持其信用。此項準備金，除以政府現有之黃金及外匯並國營事業之賣得價金撥充外，自須另向美國商借若干萬萬元美金以充實之，而由理財專家以最嚴格的方法管理，按期公布，以昭大信。</p>
<p>（三）中央銀行現存及收購之金銀，陸續交由造幣廠彭鑄硬幣，以增人民對於新幣之信仰，但除輔幣必須即時發行，以應需要外，金幣則非至相當時期，不宜發行流通。</p>
<p>（四）外匯於一年或兩年之期限內，予以嚴格的管制。必要之進口貨，以出口貨抵銷，採物物交換之原則。其他非必要之外匯一律停止結售。總之，無論在何情形下，在一年之時間內，絕對不動用前項準備金。</p>
<p>（五）舊幣於一定期間內一律收回，禁止流通。調換之新幣在一定數額以上者，除必要之生活費及薪水等項之維持費，得按金額大小之比例，分期提取其一部份外，其餘予以短期之凍結，以減少第一期之發行額，而防止膨脹。凍結部份，由中央銀行發給記名存券，給以相當利息。</p>
<p>（六）調換新幣，手續務求簡便，以免過度騷動。錢莊商號機關學校均可委託經理，人手如嫌不足，則臨時徵用高中以上之學生助理之。</p>
<p>（七）新幣實行後，一切物價一律恢復抗戰前一年之原狀，米每石爲新幣十元，大餅油條每件爲新幣一分，布每尺爲新幣一角。主要之糧食及必要之日用品，仍採戰時之辦法予以統制，由糧食部及經濟部疏通來源，統籌配給。爲求配給制度之施行無弊，首宜通令各保甲長尅日完成戶口調查。此項工作可臨時徴用高中以下高小以上之學生爲之。</p>
<p>（八）政府財政宜力求平衡。所有軍政各費暫按抗戰前一年之預算發放，從而公敎人員之薪給即亦一律恢復戰前之原額，生活因以安定，貪汚自可經跡。惟薪額在二百元以上者，應以其超過額之半數，予以短期之凍結，名　儲蓄，優給利息。倘有機關因人員增多，舊有預算不能配合現狀者，應令裁汰冗員自行調節之。</p>
<p>（九）政府發行之公債，類皆戰節之物，爲增人民對政府之信仰，並鼓勵其投資計，宜一律以新幣按原額承認之，但已屆還本期者，延期一年至五年償還，仍照給利息。</p>
<p>（十）人民之儲蓄存款，其存入之時期在戰前者，一律按原額償還本息，其存入之時期在戰時或戰後者，按逐年物價指數之總和折合新幣。已爲訴訟上之請求而得確定判決者，依判決。淸償期已屆至者，一律延期一年，然後按數額之大小分期償還之。延期時間仍依原訂利率給予利息。以新幣承認戰前存款，雖若干銀行或不免因此受有掛失，但意義深長，無形之收穫，有不可同日而語者。儲蓄存款大抵係中產階級，節衣縮食而積聚，以備子女敎育，防病養老之用。歷時十年而不提用，其信仰法幣可謂深矣。倘以舊幣折算償付，則往日之心血，及多年之期望盡付流水。嗣後無論政府如何提倡並無論銀行如何宣傳，對於儲蓄必視爲畏途不敢嘗試。按獎勵儲蓄，爲政府安定民生穩固經濟之唯一良策，吸收存款，爲銀行運用遊資調劑金融之主要業務。今以新幣承認此項存款，無異昭示於人曰，任何投資無如儲蓄之穩妥可靠者，足以鼓舞儲戶之興趣，而增强其信仰。儲蓄存款之數額增多，新幣之信用即由是而建立，理至明顯。至銀行方面旣予以緩期償還之便利亦不至因一時週轉欠靈而動搖其基礎。倘銀行誠有困難者，應由政府全力支持之，務使此項國定政策，見諸實施，而收效果。</p>
<p>（十一）民間之黃金外匯由政府定收買之價格予以收買，但在初期不宜强制收買；歷年政府所行之經濟政策，屢次失敗，自不免影響人民之信心。新幣實行之時人民鑒於旣往之慘痛經騐，不免疑慮，而抱觀望之態度。倘政府將黃金外幣强制收歸國有而凍結其代價者，人民必責政府爲沒收其合法取得之財產而生想恨之心；倘政府　僵收買者，則在新幣信用宋著以前，此項遊資必另謀出路，作種種投機或囤積之利用，因而妨害新法幣政策之推行。權衡得失，還以　其自然之爲宜。如此，旣足以昭示政府保護人民財產之至意，亦所以表彰新幣有其內在之償　，並不仰仗民間之黃金外匯以爲撑持。但誠有人能體認政府之苦心，或激於愛國心而自願以黃金外匯賣與國家者，或因急需現款面不得不將黃金外匯變賣者，政府即照章予以收買，給付價金之半數，而將其餘半數予以短期之凍結，或作爲定期一年或半年之存款而給予利息。人民自動之捐獻，政府爲其尊一嚴計，宣予謝絕。</p>
<p>（十二）舉辦黃金及外幣存款，保證到期時一律以黃金及外幣償還本息，決無折扣。此項存款，因旣往之失敗，或不能鼓起人民之興趣，但新幣之信用一經樹立，其前途亦不如所想　之悲觀。中央銀行接受此種存款即撥交凖備庫予以封存絕不動用。故在中央言，其接受此項存款，不但無利可圖，抑且賠貼，殊不上算，但爲增强新幣之信用計，應在所不計也。黃金外匯，本屬呆物，民間進資所以趨之若騖者，因鑒在法幣信用之消失，而思保全耳。一旦新經濟基礎樹立堅固，此種呆物已無前途，存戶必爭欲折合新幣，存放銀行，以收較厚之利息，勢所必然。</p>
<p>（十三）舉辦工商貸款，扶掖實業，必須與新法幣政策相輔而行。新舊交替之際，因籌碼緊縮，週轉欠靈，或不免有一度之紛擾而引起類似不景氣之現象。爲預防此種不良之結果，宜繼續舉辦工商貸款，以純客觀之標準，爲准駁之依據，不得有絲毫徇私舞弊之情事。大戰以後，產業盡遭破壞，物資早感缺乏，今又因實行新幣，不得不管制外匯，限制進口，其情形必更見惡劣。一面物資不足，一面購買力减弱，此種矛盾處必設計爲之調和。倘政策妥善，執行有方，過渡時期必有之紛亂現象，爲時必甚暫，不致發生嚴重之結果。</p>
<p>（十四）嚴厲執行法律，根絕貪汚，爲新法幣政策成敗之關鍵。頻年戰亂民生凋弊，國幾不國，救亡圖存，在此一舉。故只可觀其成功，不容復遭失敗。國家大信，不可輕作試騐，政策旣定，應即動員全國上下，以鐵的意志，全力赴之。公務人員無一非爲此政策之執行人，今待遇已予改善，生活可臻安定，自應忠實服務，倘仍查得貪汚情節，即執法以繩，不得瞻徇。亂世用重刑，即此之謂也。監察委負宜巡察各地，全國人民尤應通力合作，盡情舉發，務期貪汚絕跡，綱紀重振。任何國家，其法律行者强，法律不行者弱。凡百事件，成功失敗，繫於執行，政策尙在其次。過去政府所行之政策，無不盡善，然終至失敗者，蓋在執行之未能有效也。今行新政，宜力矯此弊，嚴厲執行，以底於成。</p>

<h3>致榴萍的復信</h3>
<p>來函見前日本欄</p>
<p>榴萍君：根據你來信所叙述的事實，我們可以得到下列的結論，第一：你小的時候，你的父親給你訂定的婚約，假使按照民法第九百七十二條：「婚約，應由男女當事人自行訂定」的規定的話，那末當初你父母代你訂定的婚約，就根本無效。但這已經是過去的事，第二：男方藉當地的惡勢力，實行「搶親」，這種行爲根本就違反了民法第九百九十七條的規定，在這一條裏面很明白指出：「因被詐欺或被脅迫而結婚者，得於發見詐欺或脅迫終止後，六個月內向法院請求撤銷之」。所以根據你來信所說這種「搶親」的行爲，根本就不合法，而且是違法。爲了你的前途，爲了你的幸福，你可以向當地法院請求撤銷此項婚事。至於償還聘金等問題，那根本是你父母的責任，與你沒有絲毫關係的。祝你快樂。編者。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>八月二十五日　靑島一日記</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>今天我的錶（不是夏令時間。年年別人過夏令時間，我偏照舊。理由是平白提前一個鐘頭，明明我是早上九點起床的，夏令時間可已經十點了，顯得我太懶似的。明明我是十二點就寢的，夏令時可已經下一點了，我的精神受威脅！因此，我固執地非不把我的錶撥快一個鐘頭不可。這樣有時不免誤事，但我遇到有約會了，總盡量警醒着。朋友們知道我這脾氣的，約我幹什麼的時候，也必再三叮嚀我：「記住呵，是我們的時間，比你的錶要早一個鐘頭！」）才八點鐘，我就起床了，在上海，這時間還正酣睡着哩。</p>
<p>先到凉台上作丁一番深呼吸，然後梳洗以畢，喝了碗香片泡的茶，再吸上一枝大前門香烟，於是開始寫作。本來預算好的，上午一定要把「江上烟」剩的一章尾巴給宰利落了，下午好出去舒舒暢暢地玩玩。對於別的事兒，我沒把握，對於要趕稿子的事兒我說什麼時候完，就得完，我這一輩子大概任何東西也控制不住，只有筆！筆聽我的官能支配，筆服從我最柔馴，而始終如一！因此，十二點半鐘我就放下筆了。我向太空吁了口輕鬆愉快的氣，邁着悠然自得的步子走出了寓所，走了了恒台路。我心裏想：再換觸小館子吧，老吃「第一春」怪膩味的。、</p>
<p>走着走着，我發現遼寗路中段，有一個小館，掛着紮了紅綢彩的招牌，上寫：「餃子大王」，看上去還乾净，於是我便走進去。只有一個小跑堂的，沒有樓，就有一間屋，擺着三張桌了。冷淸淸的，不像是作生意，傑個家庭。掌櫃娘穿着白綢衫褲，挽個　兒。笑嘻嘻地直招呼着。我看見靠窗的一張桌子已經有客人了，便只好佔了另外一張比鄰的桌子。我要了三十個餃子。這兩天餃子可眞吃得不少了，前天兩頓都是吃的餃子，但也一點兒不覺得膩味。到底是北方人的原故</p>
<p>餃子沒作好，只有抽着烟等，屋子裏靜得就像打中覺了。忽然，聽見鄰桌的那位客人開了腔，我回頭瞅了一眼，敢情他早吃過飯了，光前是在看報，如今報看完了，嘴裏哼起小曲兒。聽口音，不是山東人，像是北平人。再仔細聽，並不是哼的小曲兒，乃是在背誦「紅樓夢」中林黛玉的「葬花詞」，而且翻來復去地老是沒個完。我的第一枝烟抽完了，餃子還沒來。</p>
<p>「小孩兒，去給買包烟捲！」那人好像被我給撩起烟癮來了。他是一口的京片子。</p>
<p>「啥脾子呀？」小孩兒跟那人挺熱的樣子，嬉皮笑臉地問。</p>
<p>「雙喜唄。」</p>
<p>烟買回來了，那人打開來取了一枝，小孩兒趕快上廚房拿火去了。這時候，掌櫃娘好像是去爲我催餃子了。屋裏只剩下我和那人，那人乘着這個空隙，低聲向我說：</p>
<p>『抽烟吧？』</p>
<p>『謝謝，剛抽過。』我答應着，連頭也沒敢抬。我有點兒怕，怕那人是流氓。也有點兒窘，不知道如何應付才好。</p>
<p>那人碰了個釘子，不再言語了。小孩兒，掌櫃娘都來了。我的餃子也好了。那人抽那人的烟，我吃我的餃子。過了一會兒。聽見那人向掌櫃娘問着：</p>
<p>『我這個禮拜八成又吃過廿萬了吧？』</p>
<p>原來那人是道裏的常顧客。</p>
<p>『二十萬還多嗎？一天吃兩頓，才三萬不到。』掌櫃娘笑着回答。</p>
<p>「呃！」那人呃了一聲，又說：「今兒個我不過喝了二兩酒！怎麼可倒暈糊糊的？看來你的酒沒滲水。』</p>
<p>我才明白那人是有點兒醉了</p>
<p>『瞧，對你這個老顧客還能弄盧頭不！」掌櫃娘的聲音都是笑的。</p>
<p>停了停，那人又換了話題。他好像存心磨瘋時間。</p>
<p>「七月七都早過了，戲院子還唱着「天河配」。不知道到底兒有這回事兒沒有？逗弄的些靑年男女們直是一把鼻涕一把淚的。我瞧哇，都是作小說的人缺！存心不讓人們快活，平白地杜撰出些故事兒，給人們招些個苦惱；就像我吧，明知故犯！就跳不出這種感情圈兒。」那人說罷，偷偸瞧了我一眼。還深深地嘆了口氣，表示他是眞的在苦惱着！</p>
<p>我早覺得了。我覺得那人一直都在瞅着我，他說的這派話，明知道人家掌櫃娘不會懂的，不是顯然說給我聽麼？但我只有裝沒聽見，低着頭吃我的餃子。果然掌　娘也直是「哼哼」，回答不出個什麼來。於是他又背誦起「葬花詞」來了，這回我才感到他的聲調是那麼悲切，那麼　　。我有些好笑，可也有些可憐他。我吃完了，把賬付掉。站起來的時候，我看見他走過我的身邊去拿那掛在墻上的一件黑色西裝上衣，一頂嶄新的草帽。他穿着的是白襯衫，白褲子，白皮鞋。人生得還淸秀，頂多三十來歲。</p>
<p>我走出飯館，那人就跟在我的後面，可也並不太靠近，由這種地方證明：他還不是一個壞蛋。儘管如此；可我總有點不自然，於是走到一家書店門口，我故意進去　擱了一會兒。但是他並不走開，也不迫過來，直遠遠地站着等。我不得不再走出來了，又經過中正公園的門口，這回他可竄到我跟前了，他是那麼胆怯地依然低聲說：</p>
<p>「逛逛神社吧，這裏淸靜。」</p>
<p>我一轉身，那人却低下了頭，他也窘了，於是我用帶怒的口氣回答他：</p>
<p>「你別認錯了人！」</p>
<p>其實我想說：「我可不是林黛玉」呀，但是我沒有。我急急向前走幾步，正好一部人力車在那兒，我顧不得講價錢，坐上去吿訴車夫了一個地點兒就溜了。</p>
<p>那人沒言語，我記得當我責備他以後，他曾呵了口氣。我坐上車子走了，我的胆子也壯了，再回頭看了看他，他還拿着那件黑上衣呆站在太陽裏咧！這時我心裏說：「幹嗎呢？好好一個靑年，（看樣子是一個流落異鄉的光桿兒公務員）無病呻吟的！作些個自尋苦惱的癲狂沒意思的蠢事兒。一我猜想他也許是失戀了，所以一個人跑來借酒澆　！可也許他根本就沒戀過愛，正在憶憬着戀愛的夢，所以才那麼自作多情地背誦着「葬花詞」，爲林黛玉而空自悲傷：不管怎樣吧，他這種人生態度總是不對的。我若是他的朋友，我一定要歡觀他，但我可沒興緻去管一個陌生人的閒事。</p>
<p>胡思亂想地不知不覺就到了海濱，我先在海濱公園兜了個圈子，找了一塊乾凈沙灘躺下休息着。我遠眺無邊的海涯，她和天只是一綫之隔，沒有雲采的時候，你簡直分不出哪是海？哪是天？近看海水啃着沙灘，不住地叨明些個聽不懂的言語，噴着些個白吐沫花子。</p>
<p>太陽晒得怪熱的，我便走向前面一家帶舞靈的「靑島咖啡店」。在靠海的廊子上我坐下來，這時客人寥寥無幾，音樂還沒開始，所以淸靜極了。我享受着這份兒的淸靜，興緻地要了一小杯白蘭地，我跟自己慶祝今天了了一件事－「江上懂」脫稿了。</p>
<p>我一口口慢慢地呷着酒，一面我欣賞着海濱的風景。在這家咖啡店的左右，都是高高低低的洋房。稍遠一點有一片綠茵茵的靑山，山上也有稀疏幾幢珠紅瓦的洋房，活像山上開了幾朶野攻瑰。這時天空飛翔着幾片白雲，又活像是柳絮被淸風舞弄得有些兒醺醺然！廊子下的一帶沙灘上，孩子們正提着綿筐檢蛤蜊。淺水中沐浴着男男女女，有一對少年，似乎是愛人，在海水裏打起架來了，男的使勁兒把女的頭按到水裏，女的一個躍身跳出了水面，用手豁着水反攻男的。男的又預備撲過去按女的頭了，女的笑着折轉身就逃，男的在後邊迫；就這樣一逃；一追，終于他們自己講和了，擁抱着沉溺在海水裏！</p>
<p>我正看得起勁兒的時候，一陣尖呌把我驚擾了！我連忙回頭瞧，是一位小姐正向着侍者發脾氣。她就坐在我的前面的一張台子旁、我一直沒注意到她，敢情她比我來的還早，從她的話裏聽得出。</p>
<p>「怎麼着？吃了飯的客人就不許多坐一會兒？緊直地拿了賬單子來催，誰還賴了你的不成」？小姐操着口廣東官話嚷嘛着。</p>
<p>「不是這意思！我舞看您吃了飯不要什麼了，以爲您是預備走囑！所以才把賬單送來。」一個侍者頭兒，走來連連向小姐陪着禮解釋。</p>
<p>「好吧，再給我來一杯咖啡，要熱的。」小姐吩咐着，氣消了些。</p>
<p>另一個侍者把咖啡送了來。忽然小姐又說：</p>
<p>「再拿瓶啤酒來」！</p>
<p>侍者也不敢待慢地趕快去照辦了。小姐把咖啡擱在一邊，先喝着啤酒。我瞧見她一邊喝着酒，一邊兩眼無神地直瞅着另外一角沒有山，沒有洋房的海天銜接的地方。一邊她還不住地抽着烟，子是我注意她面前的烟灰盤，哼！起碼也有二十個烟頭兒。當然，也許不一定都是她自己兒抽的，但從她生氣到現在，頂多二三十分鐘吧，可不止抽過五根。我心裏說：她比我兇，她一經是一根接一根了，她的速度更比我快上一倍。</p>
<p>小姐生得不難有，圓臉蛋兒，一對水汪汪的眼睛，像是隨時都要哭似的。兩道眉失去自然了，修得那麼尖細。端正的鼻子，雖然不太高。小嘴，塗着大紅的唇膏。頭髮燙過很久，已經直了，披在兩肩上。穿一件藍底白花的綢旗袍，白鞋，沒穿襪子。體格不瘦不胖，皮膚是棕色的。她不會是學生，歲數相當大了。也許是一個女敎員。我猜想。她彷彿有什麼心事，顯得很煩燥，憂懣。她使力抽着烟，又一口口濃濃地噴出去。像是要噴出她的苦悶！時時她搔搔她的頭髮，順手再揪下一兩根兒來。她喝酒也是那麼性兒急，一大杯一忽兒就沒有了，一瓶兩大杯。不到廿分鐘她都一掃而光。剩下那杯熟咖啡，她仍是那麼三兩口嚥下去了。像是要借這東西冲淡她的傷感！</p>
<p>「她是爲什麼這樣惱煩呢？也是失變？」我這樣揣摩着，不禁想起晌午那位背誦「葬詞」的假寳玉來了，我想：要是我算就了這裏也有這麼一位對象的話，我一定把那人給引到這裏來，好讓他們同病相憐一番，也許彼此能够塡補一些空虛之感！然而我的懊悔是白費，我沒法再找回那人。那麼，我去安慰安慰這位小姐嗎？我倒是不怕了，我也願這樣作，但我却覺得我的安慰不會是她所需要的！我這樣作了，沒準兒還碰上一鼻子灰！犯不着！還是別管閒事的妙。於是我這會子什麼風景也顧不得看了，直冷跟觀察着她——直至她收歛了那雙遠眺海天的眼睛；直至她抽完最後一根烟；直至她付了賬站起來，越至她蹣跚地走出去，像不生根的幽靈似的走到黃昏裏去了！</p>
<p>這時，我的白蘭地也喝光了，我又要了一份兒冰糕吃了。天快黑了，我再順便兒解決了晚餐問題。在音樂聲裏，我踏着有節奏的步子，伴了月光走回來。</p>
<p>一到寓所，那位對面小樓上的一位像是永遠患着月經病的女士，已經辦公回來了，而且又在那裏「哇啦哇啦」地責駡用人。不知怎的，這些天，我一看見她就覺得頭痛，我簡直有點兒怕她了！她的那副經常彷彿誰欠她二百銅錢似的不掛一絲微笑的臉，使你沒法兒不觸目驚心！加上她那經常是咀咒的聲音，更使你聰了毛髮悚然！她簡直是一隻瘋狗，隨時都有亂咬人的可能。爲了她給我的精神成脅，我不得不一直躱着她——她上班去了，我打開窗子，她一回來，我就連忙關牢窗子。反正，我盡量廻避她。如今我只好又關上窗子了。我坐到寫字台前回憶着今天的兩個有趣的遭過，覺得頗耐人尋味的，於是一口氣把它們記了下來。</p>
<p>我的錶已經十二點了，疲憊襲上欠神，不由自主地倒在了牀上。今天夜裘，大概不用看書就可以熟睡了！（書自靑島）</p>

<h3>紅燭的火花</h3>
<p>— 馮士珂</p>
<p>一枝枝嬌艷的紅燭，燃着了無數團熊熊的火花。她們倚傍在「作協文講」絳帳的正面，儘量地散發着智慧的光芒。</p>
<p>那雄偉綺麗的絳帳呵！他以他廣袤的幅員，小心翼翼地掩護着她們光芒的四射；更遮斷了從窗子的掣隙裘，徐徐侵入掠過戶外的風颼——在他的羽覆下，他不讓任何一枝纖細的紅燭，熄滅在囂鬧紛亂的恐怖之中。</p>
<p>那絳帳廣袤的幅員呵：他伸張着巨大而有力的胳膊膊，圍住了一方優美恬靜的幽境，適應着每一枝亭亭紅燭的體溫，讓她們在溫馨的鍛鍊中，繼續地燃燒着，燃燒着；以至用她們軒昂而帶着微笑的火熖，一齊唱出了人世間平和而愉快的福音。</p>
<p>文藝女神，在水波也似地盪漾着，柳絲也似地輕拂的巨幅絳帳的上端，她據高臨下地鳥瞰着這一切甜密的生意，用她那像玫瑰花瓣一樣諧和的可嚀，來對她們作無價的餽贈了——</p>
<p>我那使人喜悅的紅燭啊，！有一分熱，發一分光，這就是妳們涉世的唯一眞諦。重視妳們煥發着的容光吧！在窗外還沒有灑下淸澈的月光，在天邊還沒有映着交輝的繁星！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「我也不喜歡這個……！」小老虎一臉的天眞氣　。</p>
<p>「我早就知道你不喜歡這個」。耀羣立刻把話接了過來：「所以說，我要不換一個樣兒出塲，萬一失錯，給鬼子圈了去，你想他們肯饒我嗎？那不是一萬個糟糕？……」</p>
<p>「不呀，紀姨、……您也改渦幾回裝，……可也用不着使這毒草玩意哪！」小老虎指着放在遠遠地的那包草藥。</p>
<p>「可你要知道，咱們這回上山西云，不是一天兩天的短期工作，不是嗎？這麼長年長月幹下去，那外國顏色粉藥，又沒長性，天天爬起要打扮一回，你想够多麼惹？……所以我才想到這柬西；只要使上一回。是邱爺說的，「可以管一輩子！」豈不省下多少麻煩？」</p>
<p>「一輩子讓這玩　毒下去？」這是小老虎的中心疑問。</p>
<p>「毒？怕什麼？……一輩子又有什麼關係？多多少少的人，爲了打鬼子，連性命都不顧，咱們還怕毒？」耀羣說到這裏，語名裏夾着些哽咽，有些說不下去了。</p>
<p>「紀姨，打完了仗怎麼辦？」小老虎的意思是說，戰事終有一天結束，直是　羣的本來姿容，亦是不能恢復，豈非把一個女子的終身都給毀壞了。</p>
<p>「什麼打完了仗怎麼辦？」耀羣大約正在悲感之中，沒有聽備小老虎的話：「打完了仗……；哼……要是敗了，當然你也不願我給鬼子據去落花姑娘，當老媽子，是不是？……打了的話，晌們死也値得，雒還管到疔泡不疔泡……况且，我就不相信沒法兒醫治，要是願意醫治的話……」</p>
<p>「因爲什麽不願意醫治，紀姨？」小老虎的孩子腦筋，把問題想得轉了彎，打破砂罐問到底！</p>
<p>小老虎這一問，可說把眞正的主題抓了一個正着，也正觸動了耀羣那個不預備說明的第二點：</p>
<p>「傻孩子，且等咱們活到了那個時候再說罷，這時候那裏管得到那麼些個！」</p>
<p>二人早飯之後，酒館的一幕就此結東了。依照原是計劃，他們向「法租界」走着；耀羣預備找到駐　支隊的同志，可以打德天津淪陷以後的情况。</p>
<p>沿路，照耀羣的分析，天津這時可以看見三種狀熊的人：一種是趾高氣揚的虎倀；一種是筆頭裏氣的可憐蒼生；一種是歧途待徊，不知所措的下愚。這，當然是</p>
<p>一種大綱式的分析。</p>

<h3>基本教育與科學知識</h3>
<p>— 劉威</p>
<p>聯合國敎育科學文化組織，遠東區基木敎育研究會議，於九月三日在我國首報間幕。會期十日，參與者十四國，爲四個區城基本敎育研究會議之首先舉行者，專家蒞止，把晤一堂，以討論世界持久和平之基本辦法，謀所以化干戈爲玉帛，泯猜疑爲諒解，甚盛事也！預料此次會議之成功，對於遠專區域各國，尤其吾國之未來基本文敎事業，將有　期性之重大意義，與深遠影響，可以斷言。吾人於預祝會議成功之餘，更應藉此機會，略貢所見，惟代表諸討察焉！</p>
<p>考遠東區域之國家，多文明古國，與新興之邦，科學大都不甚發達。處茲强力競爭世界，科學進步，一日千里，以國家言，苟無相當之科學基礎，即難免受他國之威脅；就個人論，倘缺乏科學知識，即不足以適應現代生活之環境。故一方面，國家宜提倡高深科學之研究，一方面，更宜灌轍科學知識於人民，二者並行不蔽，相輔相成。因此，科學知識之傳播，在基本敎育中，實佔重要之位置。顧檢討基本敎育會議之主旨，首在掃除文盲，對於如何傳播科學知識於一般大衆，尤其在科學落後之許多遠東國家，並無專條之規定。吾人本科學家之立塲，切盼此次會議於若干主題之外，能將普及科學知識，列爲重要課題之一，詳加研討，製爲方案，以俾各國採用，知所從事，以應時代之需求，蓋束方國家現在所最感缺乏者，爲物質建設，非精神文明。</p>
<p>復次，吾國科學晚興，科學敎育甚爲落後，亟應改善，以圖進步。吾人誠宜趁此次國際會議機會，審度國情，借助他山，澈底討論改進吾國科學敎育之方案，如敎材之選擇，敎學法之活用，圖書之編撰，儀器之製備，實騐之設計，電化敎學之採用，一般平民科學知識之灌輸等等，皆宜集思廣益，審時地之宜，更參以他國之成規，實施情况，作成不空通，可實行之計劃，以爲改進之張本，一矯過去偏枯之弊病，納科學教誦於正軌，作之模範，樹爲風聲，先他國而獲基敎會議之裨益，則此次南京會議，爲不虛矣！</p>
<p>聯合國文敎組織秘書長赫胥黎博士，爲科學名家，對於南京會議，寄以深切之期望，其祝詞中有一警語，即「科學知識，如何能傳授給非專門家，」可謂先獲我心，所望與會諸代表，本此意旨，作爲會議之南指可也。</p>
<h3>穿雲霧的！　電視偵察機</h3>
<p>— 白吿</p>
<p>利用電視的偵察機，在現代戰爭技術上，已漸露它的頭角。現在一部分的科學家和軍事家，對於它均在努力研究，謀軍事上的便利。</p>
<p>一隻飛行極高的飛機把中彈區域的眞相用無綫電電視傳到後方使遠在二十哩外的砲位上的軍官能够「眼見」開砲後的結果。這事想起來似乎不可信，但是法國科學家已經兩年的秘密寶驗而達到這個目的，且已引起法政府的嚴重注意了。</p>
<p>法政府人員會得目睹一張在偵察機上攝得的軟片，在相距數哩外的一組電視器上複演－並且攝片至複演其間僅相隔七秒鐘！</p>
<p>關於這個發明未有專稱，暫且稱爲「發明X」它的詳細內容尙守秘密，不過它確是一種驚人的發明。</p>
<p>現在已設計完成一種持殊飛機能够帶一隻攝活動影片的照相機，在一萬五千呎至二萬呎的高空中攝取地面上詳組的狀况。高空中攝活動影片在軍事上和商業上已應用多年，沒有什麼希奇。但是電視偵察機直且利用紅外光綫的照相機能够透過霧烟或雲攝取地面情形，所以不論在任何氣候下都可使用敵人雖用烟幕，也不能逃避它的偵察。</p>
<p>這個照相機由一位視察員用手發動。它有一個巨大而活動的視界審察器，能助他使透鏡收到一個廣大的面積。飛機到達需要偵察的地面上時攝影拔師即令軟片發動，歟片隨即自動經過照相機。</p>
<p>但是軟片經過照相機後，並不捲在軸上以備飛機飛返根據地後顯像，却隨即經過一隻顯像櫃，再經過定像盆和受一種細水注的冲洗。冲洗手績完畢後，軟片即在一個電視分像盤下經過分像盤連接於裝在飛機上另一艙內一個小型而本領强的發送機。</p>
<p>但是這種子續能够施於實用，中問實有許多困難需要克服。空氣的溫度和它對於軟片顯像的影響等，還是諸般困難中比較的小問題。可是法政府與研究人員終在奮鬥中。</p>
<p>一陣砲彈集中花數哩外的敵人據點，而軍官可在火綫外的砲位上坐視它們的威力自砲彈炸裂至幕上映出破壞工作的結果，其間祇需七秒鐘。靠這樣電視機的報吿砲彈的射擊不準就不難迅速校正，而目標如有任何重要變動，也得顯明的暴露，</p>
<p>敵軍對於這種偵察機當然嫉視努力驅逐。但是電視偵察機也可以武裝自衛，並且必有一隊戰鬥機拱衛它，以抵抗空中聲撃它的敵機。</p>
<h3>海水</h3>
<p>沈平</p>
<p>爲什麽是藍的</p>
<p>海水因反映天空之藍色而變藍之說，最近已被美國加利福尼亞大學物理敎授捷金博士及韋而遜山天文台台長鮑溫博士斥爲虛妄。彼等在測探潛水艇時，發現海水中之無數汚質將所受之日光反映至水面，但反映出之光彩必透渦數尺以至數十尺之水，然後可達水面；因此水將日光中之紅及黃色吸去，而餘下之綠藍及紫三色組成眞正深海之藍色。</p>
<h3>北極的資源</h3>
<p>— 宋吾</p>
<p>北極區域的資源非常豐富，北緯六十度南北大陸上的大森林，爲世界最可寳貴的資源，目前尙未充分利用，同時尙有大片尙未墾種的肥沃農地，如坎拿大的大奴湖以南區域。西伯利亞的農業界綫業已推進至北緯六十八度，如北極圈以北的伊垃加(Igarka）附近，即可生長洋薯和蔬菜，極地不少地方長着灌木，草類，和苔蘇地衣等各種植物。</p>
<p>北極冰天雪地中，人類活動絕少，唯動物種類及數量仍甚繁夥，具有特殊經濟價値者，陸上有馴鹿，麝牛，麝鼠，白兎，旅鼠，獺，貂，狼，狗，狐，熊等；海上則有海豹，海馬，鯨魚，沙魚等；空中飛禽鳥類種類亦多。其中鹿熊魚之肉可供免用，阿垃斯加目前已有大規模的養鹿事業；海豹與鯨魚體內之油脂爲當地取暖燃火取給最方便的燃料來源，各種動物毛皮可供禦寒之用，鯊魚油爲製魚肝油之重要原料；北極狗體高力大，用以拖運雪撬爲冰地雪地中最方便之交通工具。</p>
<p>北極礦產蘊藏豐富，極有發展希望，西伯利亞和北美沿北冰洋岸，將來可能成爲世界最大產油中心之一，坎拿大西北部馬更些河（Mardenzie）下游的諾門(Norman）油井已設有煉油廠，並鋪設油管通到阿拉斯加公路上的白馬（White　horse）站，供應汽車和飛機的需要，西伯利亞北極圈內和斯匹次伯根羣島上煤田很廣，均由蘇聯着手開採。西伯利亞，坎拿大和阿拉斯加極區均以產金著名，如雅庫次克共和國，育空河流域均爲世界著名產金中心。鈾爲製造原子彈的原料，世界最重要之鐳鑛即在坎拿大大熊湖畔愛爾多拉多（Eldorado）礦區，目前該區巳形成一市鎭，名爲鐳港（Port　Radiu日），有礦工二百餘人，利用河道或空運將鑛砂遝至奧大略湖之希望港（Port　Hoqe。），利用尼亞加拉的水電設廠提煉出鐘和鈾,大戰中美國製造原子彈的鈾，主要取給於此。</p>
<h3>能量會變物質嗎？</h3>
<p>— 珊詩</p>
<p>電能是否可能變成一種實物而使其能量繼續存在？這是什麼力量－比電力和地心吸力還强－能够使原子的核連結一起？電是否可以一直接」從一團原子中而來？原子是不是能够作爲熱的來源？怎樣能够使「核子鍋爐」不發生爆炸？原子能是否可能作爲一切機械的原動力？</p>
<p>對於這些問題，科學家認爲原子能在和平時的應用，必須像在戰時中的貢獻一樣，爲了達到此種目的，各國都傾全力加以研究。在美國，原子能研究委員會設立兩個工作中心：芝加哥附近的阿肯實騐室和長島的勃魯克海芬宣騐室，他們努力尋求放射性元素之同位元素對於能與機械的關係，冶金術元素的分子或原子的構造，用鈾與石墨等種稱物質做試騐，冀得一最好的結果，而原子能對於人體的夢響和在生物學上及化學上的功效，更視爲研究重心。</p>
<p>據最近美國科學雜誌發表，已計劃出一種可以產生一千兆伏特的機械，同時據哥倫比亞大學教授拉比博士（曾獲諾貝爾獎金）謂，將來可能達到三或四千兆伏特以上呢！他的解釋是：「這種能量　的質子或中子是可能的。」</p>
<p>質子是氫原子的核，它立即興自由電子結成氣氣；所以對於大量伏特數的能量，科學家希望反證得到「顆原子彈爆炸時的現象，物質旣能變成能量，能量也一定會變成物質的！</p>
<h3>談談航空測量</h3>
<p>— 阮孟寬</p>
<p>上海市政府邀請空軍總部，施測上海全市的航空測量地形圖，沈寂已久的航空測量，獲此消息，不勝欣喜。</p>
<p>談起航空測量，應用飛機來攝製地圖，早已開始在歐美諸國，第一次世界大戰，德軍應用航攝，偵察地形，收獲甚大，其後各國相繼採用，不但專供軍事偵察，而土地測量，亦可應用，即在我國亦有十餘年的歷史，惟抗戰時期，一度停止，戰前亦會轟動一時，如乍浦·南昌·黃河泛汎及華南鐵道勘測等，均係用飛機攝影。現在世界科學家已不在研究航空攝影問題，都是研究的航空製圖問題，如何使所攝的照片，能製成興實地一模一樣的地形圖，高低的曲綫，平面的距離，不會使牠有絲毫的差誤。</p>
<p>至於航空測量之步驟，可分控制·　攝。糾正。調查，製圖等，如有高低曲綫，還諾要立體製圖。吾人如測量上海地形圖，先來一次人工測量的工作，將廣大的地區依用三角法逐漸縮小控制，所謂大小三角測量及圖根測量，這種測量，非本篇範圍，恕不　述。但現代科學已經研究不用人工控制的航空測量，是用幅射三角測量代替，此類測量方法，完全室內工作，在航空照片上選定點子，控制地區。惟在荒山僻野，人烟荒蕪之區，而所測最小比例尺（如十萬分一以上）有人用之，而用於大比例尺，其精度尙不能達到吾人之滿意。</p>
<p>其次就是航攝，航攝即是航空攝影，應用飛機，帶着照相機到天空中作埀直照相的工作，這裏與普通照相所不同者，一是垂直或急傾斜照相，一是側而照相。其照相機與底片亦有不同，前者照相機是固定的，而焦距一定。後者是活動的，焦距可以自由。鏡頭須相仿，前者一個至多個，後者僅一個。即是底片，一是全色（紅光要感光）一魚。非全色片。我們攝影的時候，在飛機上一共四人至五人，除駕駛外，一人指揮航綫，一人管理無綫電，其他一人或二人管理攝影機。攝影機大都是電動器，亦有手搖器。如果吾人欲測一萬分一照片，則按公式計算航高，假定焦距是廿一公分（也有十公分），則所要航高爲二千一百公尺。吾人先按飛機內的氣壓表昇上二千一百公尺，當然所昇起的高度，不一定很準確，我們只求其近似，所以所照像片的比例尺隨之有大小，我們必須將其改正，謂之糾正。我們糾正時，應用用一架糾正儀，利用電光的透視作用。使地面上所測的控制點與照片上相就的點子相合，如果不一致，改正高度及飛機的華西斜與偏斜角。糾正後放大成五千分一或一千分一藍圖，加以實地調查，着墨製圖，就成一幅地圖。但是這幅地圖是沒有山地曲綫·如果加測山地·有一種立體製圖儀，或者多倍製圖儀上，再應用電光講告出一座立體模型來，如申報館出版的「中國全圖」內之立體地圖一樣，吾人架上紅綠眼　，即可在製圖儀上依其立體模型畫出山高的曲綫來，那是一輻完善的地形圖了。</p>

<h3>Important Topics of the Fourth Plenary Session: Eradicating Corruption and Reforming Politics; President Chiang Returns to Nanjing to Preside Over the Opening</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 7th] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng told this agency that the important items on the agenda of the Fourth Plenary Session include political and economic reforms and the eradication of corruption. However, these reform plans are not the result of Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China. The Kuomintang's reforms were planned long ago and will be temporarily limited to reforming local administration. Wu also emphasized that the National Government will not change its fundamental policy of cooperating with the Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties to implement national construction plans. He also called on Kuomintang members to support the party merger plan to establish a united revolutionary front to cope with the current difficulties. Wu also said that at the Fourth Plenary Session, party members will thoroughly discuss and adopt measures to eradicate corrupt practices.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] Senior officials said that the Kuomintang's Fourth Plenary Session will decide on a major party purge, including some senior party members and government officials. Those who are disloyal to the party headquarters and the government, those who are demonstrably corrupt, and those whose public and private behavior disgrace the party's reputation will be subject to expulsion. The targets of the purge are not factions within the party, but only individual party members. The names of senior party members who have been accused will not be announced for the time being. According to Kuomintang rules, the accusation procedure should be initiated by the local party headquarters and then reviewed by the Central Supervisory Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 7th] The Chairman is scheduled to descend the mountain at 9:00 AM on the 8th to return to Nanjing to preside over the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session. It was previously reported that the Madam would stay in Kuling for a short time, but due to the sudden change in the mountain climate, she may return with him. However, if the weather is bad on the 8th, the departure date may be delayed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 7th] This morning, Kuling was shrouded in rain and mist, and the temperature dropped sharply. The Chairman and Madam visited the Union Church at 11:00 AM to attend the service. The Chairman and Madam sat in the sixth row in the church. At 12:00 PM, the service ended, and the Chairman and Madam walked side-by-side with paper umbrellas in the autumn rain back to the official residence. Although today is a Sunday rest day, the Chairman still received guests as usual in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Central Committee members attending the National Congress Plenary Session continued to register with the Central Party Headquarters on the 7th, including Xie Guansheng, Zheng Jiemin, and Liang Hancao, totaling eighteen people. Together with the number of people who registered on the 6th, the total is sixty-nine.

<h3>Youth Corps Plenary Session Discusses Kuomintang Reform Outline</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Second Plenary Session of the Youth Corps held a full day of meetings on the 7th, with the second meeting at 9:00 AM, the third meeting at 3:00 PM, and the fourth meeting at 9:00 PM. A joint meeting of cadres and supervisors will be held on the morning of the 8th, and the fifth meeting will be held in the afternoon. The closing time has not yet been decided. Some attendees at today's meeting advocated that after the Fourth Plenary Session approves the organizational method for party and corps unification, the meeting should continue before closing. However, no final decision has been made yet. At today's meeting, Chiang Ching-kuo reported on the process of handling the general review of corps members and youth issues and provided many suggestions. After the report, the issue of unified party corps organization was discussed. At the afternoon meeting, the "Draft Outline for Kuomintang Reform" was discussed, and speakers were very enthusiastic. However, the general opinion was that the案 was too vague and did not specify concrete measures for personnel and systems, how to achieve reform in the future, national unification, and suppressing bandits. It should be resubmitted for review and reorganization. At the meeting, He Haoruo also proposed important opinions on the division of labor between the party and the government in unifying the corps to promote party-corps cooperation and increase work efficiency. This opinion was supported by the majority, and it was decided to resubmit the案 for review and immediately appoint Liu Jianqun, Huang Yuren, Huang Shaogu, and eighteen others to form a reorganization committee, which will meet on the evening of the 7th to reorganize the案 and submit it to the meeting on the 8th for discussion. The draft is divided into two major parts: the current political outline of our party and the current organizational outline of our party. The first part is divided into: (1) eliminating the communist bandits, (2) consolidating national power, (3) eradicating corruption, (4) implementing constitutional government, (5) improving people's livelihood, and (6) supporting youth. The second part is divided into: (1) regarding party members, (2) regarding organizations, (3) regarding cadre policy, and (4) regarding discipline. In addition, a temporary motion at the meeting requested the presidium to report to the meeting on the implementation measures for the unified party-corps organization, which was accepted by the presidium.</p>

<h3>Currency System Research Council Decides Not to Establish</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] It is heard that the authorities originally intended to establish a currency system research committee to study various issues related to the currency system. Later, it was decided not to establish it because Yu Hongjun and Zhang Jia'ao of the Financial Group of the National Economic Council had been ordered to specialize in this matter.</p>
<h3>Nomination Period for National Assembly Representative Candidates May Be Extended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] It is rumored that the authorities have not yet made a final decision on issues such as party nominations, election affairs in the pacification zones, and overseas elections, and the nomination deadline for National Assembly representative candidates may be extended.</p>

<h3>Chen Bulei Meets with Our Newspaper Reporter; Talks About China's Journalism; Chen Stays in Kuling Temporarily Due to Unrecovered Health</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kuling, 7th] Central Committee member Chen Bulei is currently planning to stay in the mountains temporarily because his health has not yet recovered and will not go to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. Mr. Chen met with our newspaper reporter at his mountain residence on the 7th and talked about China's journalism. Mr. Chen believes that currently, in addition to a few newspapers in China with substantial content and correct opinions, there are many that do not meet the cultural standards. Mr. Chen said: Newspapers should be able to reflect the opinions of the people and report accurately. If a newspaper is unsound in some part, it may affect its own position. Now the influence of newspapers on readers is great, while the influence of readers on newspapers is small. Mr. Chen then discussed the situation of China's journalism before the war, during the war, and at present. He deeply believes that the progress of various sectors of China's journalism has not reached the ideal level in terms of the current situation. There is also an abuse of freedom and democracy, issuing newspapers as tools for personal elections or other purposes, regardless of the substance of their content or the low cultural level, and often making inaccurate or malicious criticisms of government policies, causing obstacles to government implementation. Mr. Chen concluded: In the future, the central idea of ​​journalists should be to recognize that China's future is bright and hopeful. Although there are unsatisfactory aspects due to various relationships, it should also be regarded as an inevitable process in the course of a certain undertaking, but we should overcome various difficulties and enhance the self-confidence and enterprising spirit of the people in the country and the nation. The reporter also asked about the Ministry of Interior's recent opinion on defining the identity of journalists. Mr. Chen said: This should be strictly regulated and self-eliminated to improve one's own identity.</p>

<h3>US Agricultural Assistant Suggests Establishing Revolving Loan Program</h3>
<p>So That Needy Countries Can Purchase Cotton From the US [Reuters, Hillsboro, Texas, 6th] White, an assistant to US Agricultural Andersson, addressed the Texas Cotton Commission, suggesting that the United States establish a revolving loan program to enable countries in need of US cotton, such as China and Japan, to purchase cotton from the United States. White estimated that Japan would need about one million bales of cotton this year, and the United States is expected to supply more than half. China imported 800,000 bales of cotton last year, and this year's import is likely to be less than this number.</p>
<h3>Singapore's Various Aspects</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>A Follow-up to the South Seas Inspection by China Airlines Plane, Part 3</p>
<p>The citizens of Shanghai are worried every day about the soaring prices, the surging labor unrest, and the surge in wages. If they knew that the situation in Singapore was several times more serious than in Shanghai, perhaps they would feel a little relieved! For example, taking rice as an example, in Singapore, the price of each picul of rice is 140 Singapore dollars, which, according to the current exchange rate, is 70 US dollars per picul, which is about seven times higher than the price of rice in Shanghai. However, the salaries of ordinary wage earners are not seven times higher than those of Shanghai people. The average salary of an office worker is about 300 Singapore dollars. In Singapore, such a salary is considered good. According to a compatriot told the reporter, the most economical life in Singapore also requires 500 Singapore dollars, or 250 US dollars. Thus, the plight of wage earners there can be imagined.</p>
<p>However, the treatment of Singapore workers is relatively superior. After the war, various occupational unions sprang up like mushrooms after rain. According to local statistics, in the new city with a population of approximately 950,000, approximately 270 unions have been established. The entire labor movement in Singapore is commanded by the Malayan Communist Party ("MCP") under the leadership of a certain overseas Chinese communist, Zhang Mingjin. Almost every union in Singapore has communist infiltration, and it is almost hopeless for many industrialists to prevent cyclical strikes from occurring in their factories.</p>
<p>According to a certain industry leader told the reporter that the average wage of unskilled workers is 5 Singapore dollars per day, equivalent to 2.5 US dollars. This number seems to be very considerable compared with the general wages in Shanghai. However, the locals say it takes a lot of effort to balance the monthly income and expenditure.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall economic picture of Singapore, it feels that all industries are in recession and the post-war reconstruction work is progressing slowly. The economic structure of Singapore is mostly based on rubber, but in the world market, the price of rubber has fallen from the original 45 US cents per pound to 29 US cents per pound. According to people in the local rubber industry, the cost of producing each pound of rubber is about 39 US cents, so they have to lose some money for every pound of rubber they sell. The fall in rubber prices reflects the entire economic situation in Malaya. You can meet people frowning and sighing everywhere.</p>
<p>In addition to the fall in rubber prices, the war in the Dutch East Indies has also greatly affected Singapore's transshipment industry. Singapore has always imported large quantities of rubber, sugar, and rice from the Dutch East Indies, and supplied various manufactured goods to the Indonesian market. However, as a result of the Dutch blockade of Indonesian ports, import and export trade has almost completely stagnated. Within the area of ​​the Republic of Indonesia, although small-scale private smuggling trade is still going on, most of the danger is too great to arouse the interest of legitimate businessmen.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the British Empire's policy of preserving foreign exchange reserves, the Singapore authorities recently stopped issuing import licenses to various currency regions. This does not mean that you can get American-made products smuggled into Singapore via Hong Kong. But generally speaking, in the past few months, Singapore's import and export industries have slightly seen a trade surplus. From January to May of this year, the total amount of imports was 581,000,000 Singapore dollars, and the total amount of exports was 569,000,000 Singapore dollars. During the same period, Singapore's exports to the United States totaled 158,000,000 Singapore dollars, and imports from the United States were only 37,500,000 Singapore dollars, resulting in a dollar trade surplus.</p>
<p>The high cost of living, the corrupt atmosphere left over from the Japanese occupation, and the British inability to establish a highly efficient administrative agency, these factors combined to create a widespread phenomenon of corruption in the colonial government. According to compatriots, the "extortion" behavior of government officials is commonplace. Malays want a clean government, and this hope was not very bright before the war, but now it seems even dimmer.</p>
<p>Let me give an example to illustrate the extortion behavior of Singapore officials. According to government regulations, citizens must first obtain approval from the authorities and obtain a vehicle purchase permit when they need to purchase a car. However, in fact, a Singapore resident can walk into the sales room of any car company and get a car without applying for a permit. According to local residents, there are many ways to obtain a permit, and the cost of each is 600 to 1,000 Singapore dollars.</p>
<p>Politically speaking, Singapore can be regarded as one of the most important communist hubs in the entire Southeast Asia region. The Communist Party was banned before the war. During the Japanese occupation, they organized a strong anti-Japanese organization under the banner of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Part of the organization's military supplies was supplied by the British, and part was seized from the Japanese army. In northern Malaya, it is said that the former guerrillas still carry weapons.</p>
<p>The "MCP" openly operates in various parts of the New Island, and the leader of the headquarters is a Chinese. It is said that "the first communist" is directly ordered by Moscow and is responsible for directing all communist activities in the South China Sea region.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to unrestricted political activities in Malaya</p>
<p>Singapore has become a battleground for our country's domestic politics. The pro-Kuomintang and anti-Kuomintang factions in Singapore are fiercely opposed to each other, and their relationship is getting deeper and deeper. Last year, during the Double Tenth National Day, there was a celebration of opposition. Recently, during the Confucian birthday memorial ceremony, the pro-Kuomintang and anti-Kuomintang factions again took different actions.</p>
<p>Recently, the British immigration authorities refused to renew the passport of a Soviet purchasing agent stationed in Singapore. The purchasing agent had purchased large quantities of rubber and other products from several Chinese commercial banks. According to unconfirmed rumors, the Soviet purchasing agent secretly provided local communists with financial assistance through trading activities. Many people say that although his passport has been revoked, he has not left Singapore, but others say that he has gone to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Alxa League of Inner Mongolia: An Oasis in the Desert; Rich in Resources and Important in National Defense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 7th] The Alxa League is one of the special leagues in Inner Mongolia. Administratively, it does not belong to the league, but is directly under the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. The league has an area of approximately 1,000 square kilometers and a population of more than 60,000. They live a nomadic life and are honest and kind. There has never been any fighting. If there are no strong neighbors, it is truly a "Shangri-La" on the northwestern grasslands. The seat of the league government is Dingyuanying, which is lined with trees and has a beautiful environment. It is an oasis in the desert. Because its buildings are mostly imitated from Beiping, it is known as "Little Beijing." When the reporter went to investigate, he paid attention to the league's culture, education, and economy. Now I will briefly describe the impressions I gained for the reference of those who care about the border areas:</p>
<p>Alxa League currently has a national experimental primary school, a league-established experimental primary school, and a Mongolian language tutoring school, a total of three schools, all located in Dingyuanying. Each school has more than 400 students. The first two are complete primary schools and also enroll Mongolian and Tibetan children. In addition to teaching ordinary courses, they also teach Mongolian. The latter is purely for Mongolian people and school-age children among lamas who are not familiar with Mandarin and do not know Mongolian. Therefore, when teaching, both Mongolian and Chinese are equally emphasized. After graduating in four years, they are inserted into complete primary schools according to their level and continue to study. The league's Zasak Darizaya is the most enlightened among the princes of Inner Mongolia. The compulsory education he implemented has achieved considerable success. It is said that they plan to establish a middle school next year so that Mongolian children can study in depth. However, they feel that there is not enough talent and hope that all parties will provide assistance. In addition, there is the Alxa League Briefing, which is directly affiliated with the Central Party and is the only lithographic newspaper in the league. It copies the concise news from the Central Broadcasting Station every day and publishes and distributes it in Mongolian and Chinese. It sells 300 copies a day. In addition to being read by the 6,000 residents of Dingyuanying, it is also distributed to important locations within the league.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, when it traded with Outer Mongolia in the past, Dingyuanying's commerce was once very prosperous. Later, the relationship with Outer Mongolia was severed, and commerce gradually declined. However, the league's abundant products are better than other leagues in Inner Mongolia. The economic future is promising. The league currently has approximately 7-800,000 sheep, more than 100,000 camels, and more than 10,000 horses. The average annual output of wool and camel hair is more than one million catties. The licorice and musk produced are of secondary importance. In terms of minerals, there are coal, salt, alkali, etc. Because coal and alkali are not in great demand, the output is not large. The output of salt is relatively large, but it is only a thousand dans per year. There are a total of thirteen salt lakes in the league, with the Jilantai Pond, which has been mined, being the largest, reaching more than 200 Chinese miles in circumference and approximately one zhang and five chi in depth. The salt produced is not only white and delicious, but can also be dug up this year and regenerated next year. It is truly an inexhaustible treasure.</p>
<p>In terms of the current situation, Alxa League is already one of the most advanced leagues among the forty-nine leagues in Inner Mongolia. However, from a national defense point of view, all its measures still need to make the greatest efforts. Alxa League and Outer Mongolia have a border area of 400 Chinese miles. Because the league produces so many special products, its economic value is very great, so it also increases the importance of its national defense status. At this time when the Outer Mongolian army is invading our Xinjiang, I hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Deng Wenyi Discusses the Military Situation in the North</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] News Agency reports: Deng Wenyi, who recently returned from an inspection tour of the Northeast and North China, stated: (1) Regarding the military situation of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Army, since the Communist bandits launched five offensives and failed one after another, the strength of the Communist bandits is far inferior to before. Their elite troops and cadres have suffered heavy losses. Although their total force is claimed to be close to 300,000, only half of them can be used on the battlefield. The so-called sixth offensive may be difficult to launch recently, and even if it is launched, it will encounter more serious setbacks. On the side of the National Army, due to the complete victory in the Shandong battle, the National Army has successively entered the customs to reinforce, and its strength has doubled. At the same time, due to the National Government's order for general mobilization, the dispatch of troops is justified, and the people are obedient. The National Army's treatment has been improved since August, and the Northeast Headquarters has been reorganized to strictly rectify military discipline. As a result, the military's prestige and morale have been greatly boosted. Judging from the current situation, with a little more time, it will not be difficult for the Northeast bandit suppression to follow the Shandong bandit suppression and achieve a decisive victory. (2) The military situation in the North has also changed in the past two months. Liu Bocheng's main bandit force has moved far away from Hebei, and most of it has been annihilated by the National Army. Although a part of Chen Yi's remnant bandits fled north of the Yellow River, they are at the end of their strength. Recently, the National Army has swept away the bandits in the Pingjinbao triangle area. Although Rong Zhen's bandit troops still claim to have 100,000 people, their main force is only three columns, about 50,000 to 60,000 people, in the Baoding and Shimen areas in the northern section of Pinghan. They are fleeing east and west, trying to escape the encirclement of the National Army. Once the main force of the National Army is concentrated, they will inevitably repeat the disastrous defeat in Jining and Zhangjiakou around October last year. (3) The political, economic, and social situation in North China has improved and stabilized compared to several months ago. Price increases are not as rapid as before, and people's hearts are more stable. The victory of the Shandong National Army and the stability of the Northeast military situation have had a great impact on North China.</p>
<h3>Three Principles Determined for Developing the Northeast Economy, No Conscription Allowed in Newly Recovered Areas for Six Months</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] In order to develop the Northeast economy, prosper industry and commerce, and regulate people's livelihood issues, the Headquarters convened relevant parties for discussion and decided on three principles: (1) Simplify loan procedures, (2) Connect the currency systems inside and outside the customs, and the legal currency is determined to go out of the customs, (3) Regulate the supply of materials and pay attention to the needs of the people.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the strengthening of administrative efficiency by the provincial and municipal governments in the unrecovered areas, three principles have been determined.

<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 7th] Chu Xichun will temporarily serve as the chief counselor of the Northeast Headquarters. After completing his mission, he will return to Datong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] The Northeast Military Service Review Conference was held at the Headquarters at 9:00 a.m. on the 6th. Director Chen attended and presided over the meeting and gave four instructions on the spot: (1) No conscription is allowed in the newly recovered areas within six months, (2) Returning righteous people from the Communist areas are not allowed to be conscripted before they are formally naturalized, (3) Conscription will be suspended for two months from now during the current autumn harvest season. (4) Strictly crack down on the practice of forcibly recruiting soldiers by miscellaneous units, and no regular troops are allowed to recruit soldiers on their own.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The General Mobilization Association of Chinese Cultural Circles for Suppressing Rebellion and Saving the Nation issued a declaration to refute the absurd theories of tail-following Communist bandits. It first explained the reason for the organization of the association, which is to mobilize cultural workers and mobilize human and material resources to complete the great cause of suppressing rebellion and saving the nation. It then pointed out that some people in the cultural circles, in newspapers and publications, opposed their so-called civil war and called for their so-called peace, claiming to be neutral and using democracy and freedom as an excuse, regarded suppressing rebellion as internal strife and party struggle, and carried out extensive counter-propaganda.</p>
<p>These absurd theories are even more unfortunate events in cultural mobilization and the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation. The declaration then took the position of clearing up Liao's arguments and upholding justice to criticize the counter-propaganda that hindered the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation: "Everyone knows that old imperialism invaded China by using warlords as tools, and new imperialism invaded China by using Communist bandits as tools. Therefore, Communist bandits are traitors, and suppressing rebellion is saving the nation. How can suppressing rebellion be referred to as a simple civil war? To be honest, suppressing rebellion is a war to resist aggression and protect independence, and it is also a war to eliminate separatism, consolidate unity, uphold the constitution, complete democracy, oppose destruction, and expand construction. In all respects, suppressing rebellion is indeed a revolutionary task. Is it not the final battle of the National Revolution of the past fifty years? Of course, revolution is also a civil war, but it must not be confused with the so-called civil war in general. It is obvious that it is not a party struggle. Some people use the fact that Special Envoy Wedemeyer pointed out that the people need peace to oppose the so-called civil war, but they do not know that needing peace is one thing, and how to seek peace is another. When peaceful methods fail, there is no other way but war. Therefore, war and peace have the wonderful effect of being opposite and complementary to each other. Moreover, calling for peace during the suppression of rebellion is tantamount to calling for peace during the final battle of the National Revolution of the past fifty years, which is actually a kind of reactionary behavior.</p>
<p>Yes, the so-called "opposing civil war" is actually to advocate for aggression, separatism, and destruction, to hinder constitutional government, and to oppose independence, unity, democratic construction, which obviously stands on the side of the Communist bandits and traitors. How can it be said to be neutral? The Communist bandits and traitors are mobilizing in their so-called "liberated areas," while "opposing civil war" under the rule of the government means that only Communist bandits and traitors are allowed to make trouble and sell out the country, and the government is not allowed to suppress rebellion and save the nation. Therefore, "opposing civil war" only under the rule of the government is actually the tail of the Communist bandits and traitors, the fifth column of the fifth column, which is by no means a neutral element, but a disguised neutral element. The Communist bandits and traitors hold their violence and willingly act as henchmen, striving to create unrest and having no atmosphere of a peaceful and legitimate political party. They cannot be treated with leniency and freedom. In particular, it should be made clear that freedom of speech cannot be used as a shield for partiality towards the Communist bandits and traitors, while suppressing rebellion against riots, traitors, and unrest is needed by democracy. This is a very important point. Can all of this not explain the mistake of that group in the cultural circles who claim to be neutral, and who use democracy and freedom as an excuse to regard suppressing rebellion as a civil war and a natural struggle, and who call for their so-called peace? We hope that they will have some understanding of the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation and make some efforts, otherwise the entire cultural circles cannot tolerate it, and the entire people cannot tolerate it either." Finally, the declaration called on cultural circles in various places to pay close attention to the tails of the Communist bandits and traitors and correct their absurd theories. It also stated that since the government has passed the General Mobilization Plan for Suppressing Rebellion and Saving the Nation, it cannot be without responsibility. Since the Communist bandits and traitors are facing the government with weapons on the front line, how can the government allow their tails to work for the Communist bandits and traitors in the rear to undermine the general mobilization for suppressing rebellion and saving the nation?</p>
<h3>Australia Donates Rubber Tree Seeds and Seedlings to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Canberra, 6th] The Australian Forest Timber Bureau has provided China with substantial assistance in forestry in the past four years. The Bureau has successively provided China with at least 10,000 tree seeds and 1,000 seedlings. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently asked the Bureau to confirm the rumor that a certain Australian rubber tree can grow to a height of 50 feet in four or five years and expressed the hope that this kind of tree could be transplanted to Nanjing. According to the Bureau's reply, the rumor that a certain type of rubber tree is indeed true, but it is not suitable for the climate of Nanjing. However, the Bureau will send three kinds of fast-growing rubber tree seeds and 15 seedlings to Nanjing. The Bureau will also send several of its publications to the Chinese National Forestry Experimental Institute at its request and will also donate 18 kinds of rubber trees for planting experiments throughout China.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Police Bureau Cracks a Major Bribery Case Involving a Russian, the Embezzled Money Totals $30,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] The Tianjin Police Bureau recently cracked a case of a person bribing with a huge sum of money. The embezzled money amounted to 30,000 US dollars. 18,000 US dollars have been handed over, and all the criminals in the case have been arrested and are being strictly interrogated. The manager of the Dalu Oil Factory at No. 4 Lingnan Road, Tenth District, Tianjin, a Russian named David Guriewidis, was arrested by the police for supplying military supplies to the Japanese enemy. His brother, Elford, and his friend Solomon Pediretti colluded with the Chinese Chen Jialan and colluded with Wang Yuguo, the prosecutor of the East Station of the Police Bureau, to bribe the Police Bureau with 30,000 US dollars in US dollars to release the arrested David. After Police Chief Li learned of this, he initially pretended to accept the bribe and accepted 10,000 US dollars on the 3rd. When 8,000 US dollars were handed over at the Hanyi Hotel on the 4th, all the criminals in the case were arrested.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US Diplomacy and the United Nations Organization</h3>
<p>In a speech delivered to the Brazilian Senate and House of Representatives on the 5th of this month, President Truman pointed out that the difficulties of post-war world peace were even greater than generally expected, but he believed they could be resolved. He also stated that the United Nations organization is indeed a powerful combination for the sake of the world's common peace and welfare, and although it has encountered various difficulties, the United States will never be discouraged by this. The United States will use all its resources to support the United Nations organization and ensure that it completes its mission. President Truman's words are, in fact, clichés that we have long been familiar with from the mouths of ordinary diplomats and do not contain any novel elements. However, in today's volatile international situation, the United Nations organization has repeatedly encountered serious tests, and its effectiveness in maintaining world peace and promoting human happiness remains a question. President Truman's speech at this time, calling on all countries of the world to unanimously support the United Nations organization, has special significance and is particularly worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The second session of the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open on the 16th of this month at Lake Success and will discuss the issue of whether permanent members of the Security Council should have the right of veto. This issue not only involves the amendment of the United Nations Charter but also has a great bearing on the true effectiveness of the United Nations organization. All countries in the world attach great importance to this session of the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie also personally led a delegation to Lake Success to participate in the United Nations General Assembly. He arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and gave a speech to the press, frankly stating China's position and attitude towards the United Nations organization. He said, "Although the Chinese government has some doubts about the possibility of amending the Charter at present, it is fully prepared to respect the majority opinion of the General Assembly on the reasonable interpretation of the veto power in the Charter, in order to restrict its use. When the San Francisco Conference passed the United Nations Charter in 1945, the four countries that convened the conference, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, issued a joint interpretation on this matter. When necessary, the Chinese government intends to support the proposal to change that interpretation." From this, it can be seen that the Chinese government can not only consistently support the United Nations organization to the end but also respect the opinions of the majority of countries in the United Nations General Assembly at any time and amend the Charter or make other interpretations. Therefore, there is no question that China will fully support the United Nations organization, but today's question is whether the United Nations organization should avoid disappointing its supporters.</p>
<p>The United States sincerely hopes that the United Nations organization can fulfill its responsibilities and will do its utmost to support it and make it the most effective organization for maintaining world peace. No one can doubt this. However, there are still bound to be errors in the policies and common will of the United States, which could lead to major mistakes in the future. Therefore, we must point them out clearly for the reference of the US diplomatic authorities and hope that they can reflect on themselves and correct them at any time.</p>
<p>The United Nations organization was born at a time when the war was about to end. At that time, far-sighted political diplomats had already seen that it was not difficult for the United Nations to win a military victory. However, immediately after the end of the war, creating world peace was the most difficult task. Therefore, while the war was still going on, a conference was held in San Francisco and a United Nations Charter was passed as the basis for creating world peace after the war. Unexpectedly, after the end of the war, although the United Nations General Assembly repeatedly convened meetings in London and New York, it has not yet been able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the United Nations organization. Although peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria have been successfully signed, peace treaties with Germany and Austria have not yet been drafted, and even the peace treaty with Japan has not yet begun to be drafted, which inevitably makes people feel that peace is even more distant. Whether for its own interests or for the responsibility it bears for world peace, the United States should step up its efforts, support the United Nations organization, and promote the realization of peace. This Pan-American Conference, under the auspices of the United States, finally led to the establishment of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance. The peace and security of the Western Hemisphere have already been greatly guaranteed as a result of this, which cannot be regarded as a major success of American diplomacy. However, under the current international relations, whether it is peace or war, it is indivisible. The United States can only achieve self-preservation, or only guarantee the peace and security of the Western Hemisphere. If the peace and security of Europe or the Far East are not guaranteed, then the United States will still have no peace to speak of, and the United Nations organization cannot play its role. We believe that the US diplomatic authorities must see the current world situation very clearly. Not to mention that today's Europe is still in turmoil, today's Asia also harbors all kinds of terrible factors that are sufficient to become a source of future international chaos. However, judging from the US diplomatic measures, the United States still does not abandon the approach of "Europe First, Far East Second." The Truman Doctrine has long been implemented in Europe, sparing no expense to assist Greece and Turkey in resisting the intrusion of foreign forces. The large-scale aid to Europe plan will also soon become a reality. However, the United States is still hesitating about the Far East, not knowing where to go. Although it knows that the seriousness of the situation in the Far East is no less than that in Europe, it ultimately feels hesitant and is unwilling to promote the Truman Doctrine in the Far East. Even some shortsighted people in the United States advocate supporting defeated countries as a stabilizing force in the Far East. This erroneous view will not only mislead the countries of the Far East, but the United States will eventually suffer the consequences!</p>
<p>In short, although the United States is now striving to promote the functions of the United Nations organization, judging from the diplomatic policies it has implemented, there are many places that run counter to its original intentions. For the sake of peace in the Far East, and also for the sake of the future of the United Nations organization, we must point out the errors of American diplomatic policy and hope that American diplomatic policy will be corrected as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>US Suggests Four-Power Consultation on Korean Political Situation; Soviet Government Refuses to Accept; Also Disagrees with US Proposal to Establish Provisional Assembly Separately</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 7th] TASS announced today a statement by the Soviet government completely rejecting the US proposal for the US, Soviet Union, China and Britain to discuss the Korean issue, and also disagrees with the proposal to establish a provisional assembly separately in the north and south of Korea. The Soviet Union's reply to the US was submitted in the name of Foreign Minister Molotov on the 4th of this month, stating: The US-Soviet Mixed Commission has not yet exhausted its wisdom and capabilities, and the US suggestion to England, China and the Soviet Union to hold a four-power conference to discuss the Korean issue is a unilateral action. The reply also reiterated the Soviet view that the US representative is to blame for the US-Soviet Mixed Commission's failure to reach an agreement. The US proposal only serves to strengthen the division between the north and south of Korea, and the current key is to organize a provisional unified government by all democratic elements in Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Moscow Radio reported that Molotov rejected the US proposal to convene a meeting of the four powers in Washington on September 8 to negotiate the stalemate in the Soviet-American occupied zones of Korea. The broadcast stated that Molotov addressed a note to Marshall on September 4, stating that the US proposal was not appropriate because the US-Soviet Mixed Commission had not exhausted its efforts to draft a completely appropriate proposal. Molotov's reply was in response to a note from Acting Secretary of State Lovett. Lovett requested the convening of a four-power conference because the US-Soviet Mixed Commission had failed to implement the Moscow Conference's agreement on Korea.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] MacArthur's May report on the activities of the Korean military government stated that the people of South Korea continue to strengthen their transitional democratic system, as the Korean Legislative Assembly has been engaged in formulating various measures to expand universal suffrage. The report announced that 18,889 refugees moved into South Korea from North Korea in April, 1,149 moved in from Northeast China, and four moved in from inland China. The report also stated that trade with China is conducted by ship and barter, and the market in Hong Kong is also forming.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Governor Will Announce Armistice Conditions; Glimmer of Hope for French-Vietnamese Peace; Hong Kong Becomes Negotiation Center for Both Sides</h3>
<p>[Reuters, 7th] Vietnamese Governor Bollaert made a peace proposal from the French government to the Viet Minh on Saigon Radio on Wednesday night, which included major concessions, including the following: (1) Accept Ho Chi Minh's previous request that France allow the Viet Minh complete independence one year after the signing of peace; (2) Retract the previous statement denying the Viet Minh's right to secede from the French Union; (3) Completely exempt the Viet Minh from the obligation to compensate France for losses; (4) Release all Viet Minh political prisoners.</p>
<p>It is reported that Ho Chi Minh's representative has flown to Hong Kong to meet with the Vietnamese Governor's representative. The hope for an early resumption of peace has never been stronger than this time in recent months. Although there has been no disclosure of Ho Chi Minh's possible reaction to the French proposal, Viet Minh underground personnel here expect the Viet Minh radio station to announce Ho Chi Minh's acceptance on Thursday, so a truce agreement may be signed as early as the weekend.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 7th] On the eve of Vietnamese Governor Bollaert's broadcast of the French peace proposal to the Viet Minh, Hong Kong has become the center of negotiations between the two sides. It is reported that three senior members of the Viet Minh and the representative of Vietnamese Governor Bollaert arrived in Hong Kong today, and they will begin negotiations with former Annam Emperor Bao Dai tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Alliance Treaty Formally Ratified Today</h3>

The main purpose of the treaty is to prevent Germany from re-aggression and stipulates the strengthening of political and economic relations between Britain and France.</p>
<h3>Next Session of the Far East Economic Commission to Be Held in the Philippines in November</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manila, 7th] The next session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is tentatively scheduled to be held in Baguio, Philippines, on November 15, after the Philippine general election. The meeting is scheduled for two weeks to discuss the needs of Eastern countries, the shortage of its main items and construction materials, the promotion of trade, finance and lending, and the development of industry. The resolutions established during the meeting will be submitted to the United Nations Economic and Social Council as proposals. The position of Chairman of the General Assembly may be elected by the Philippine Finance Minister Guitaño. The Philippine government is actively preparing for the arrangement of the meeting place.</p>
<h3>British, French, and Australian Reduction of Imports Affects US Industry</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] According to a survey today, the US industry has lost no less than one billion US dollars in transactions due to the recent decisions by Britain, France, and Australia to reduce imports. The goods that the three countries decided to stop purchasing are all urgently needed, but due to the reduction in the supply of US dollars, they must be saved as US dollars for purchasing necessities. France decided to save 250 million US dollars in the next six months, and Australia decided to reduce imports by 40 million US dollars each year. Most of these savings are on the US side, but smaller gold standard countries will also be affected, especially Canada.</p>
<h3>US Response to Gold Allocation Proposal is Cold</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal that the United States should redistribute the gold at Fort Knox, although it is fresh news today, has not changed the US's cold attitude towards this proposal. According to London, Bevin's argument is that the United States should increase the US dollar value of its huge gold reserves so that it can use this "surplus" to aid Europe without directly increasing the tax burden of American taxpayers. The government said that this is another invitation to ask the United States to borrow money and give gifts. US Treasury Secretary Snyder recently denied any intention to change the price of gold to 35 US dollars per ounce, so the Treasury Department will definitely oppose this. In any case, changing the price of gold must be approved by Congress, and there is no such intention in Congress at present.</p>
<h3>To Avoid Paying a Greater Price, the United States Must Accelerate Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] The State Department agreed on the 6th to accelerate the implementation of Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Neal, Acting Director of the International Trade Policy Division of the State Department, broadcast a statement from the State Department tonight, saying: "We believe that the timetable for the Marshall Plan must be advanced so that Europe can receive aid before the end of this year."</p>
<p>Neal also said that many European countries, such as Britain, France, and Italy, are in serious situations. Although Neal did not say that a special session of Congress must be convened to advance aid to Europe, he said, "Congress is scheduled to reconvene in January next year, so it is difficult to expect action before spring. However, if European countries cannot import coal and food this winter, the situation will inevitably become critical." Neal also strongly stated that the United States is determined to do its best to help Europe. From a moral point of view, the United States cannot just sit idly by and watch it collapse or watch its people starve to death simply because other countries do not have the money to purchase reconstruction materials. From an economic point of view, the United States cannot sit idly by and watch its huge production facilities collapse simply because of a lack of capital. From a political point of view, the United States cannot allow right-wing or left-wing dictatorships to grow under the lack of assistance. In short, the United States' refusal to provide assistance will actually cost more than providing assistance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Detroit, 7th] The president of the Automobile Workers' Congress of the Congress of Industrial Organizations of the United States, Luces, requested on the 7th that President Truman convene a special session of Congress and proposed to immediately restore the control of prices of food and other major items. In a letter to the President, Luces warned that if Congress convenes a special session to intensify action on the European economic crisis, it must also take action on the "domestic economic crisis."</p>
<h3>France Will Apply to the US Export-Import Bank for a New Loan of 500 Million US Dollars; France's Reduction of Bread Rationing Causes Disturbances Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 6th] Well-informed sources said today that the French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, will return to office next week, and the cabinet has ordered him to apply to the US Export-Import Bank for a loan of 500 million US dollars to tide over the difficulties until the Marshall Aid Plan takes effect. This is the second time in months that France has applied to the Export-Import Bank for a loan. The first application was for 500 million US dollars, and the result was 250 million US dollars. France needs money to buy food, gasoline, and wheat. The bread ration has been reduced by two ounces again, causing disturbances throughout the country. Yesterday, 150,000 workers marched in Paris to protest the reduction of bread rationing, shouting slogans such as "Ramadier resigns" and "Ramadier to the guillotine." At the same time, Prime Minister Ramadier won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly yesterday and is reportedly drafting broad administrative, financial, and budgetary measures to reorganize the interior.</p>
<h3>Fort Knox Vault; Door Weighs Over 40,000 Pounds; Stores 12,000 Tons of Gold</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent sudden proposal that the United States should redistribute the gold at Fort Knox, the world's largest gold reserve, has thus reappeared in the news. What exactly Bevin meant, how this plan will be implemented, and what benefits it will bring are all a big secret. Reporters and another United Press reporter spoke with US Treasury Department personnel and private economists for hours, but no one knew for sure what Bevin meant. However, the people's curiosity about the large storage of 12,000 tons of gold in Kentucky has been aroused again because of Bevin's proposal. In fact, the gold at Fort Knox is only a part of the US gold reserves. The total value of gold used by countries around the world as currency reserves is about 38 billion US dollars, of which 21.8 billion US dollars belong to the United States. And about 12.5 billion US dollars are stored in a heavily guarded vault at Fort Knox. This gold is all melted into gold bars, each only six inches long and weighing about 27 and a half pounds, with an estimated 829,000 pieces stored in it. The vault is divided into two floors, one underground and one on the ground. The door of the vault weighs over 40,000 pounds. The US government built this vault for storage in 1946 because it had too much gold in storage.</p>
<h3>Truman's Outing in Brazil Suffers False Alarm; Car Wheel Comes Off and is Only Inches Away from Cliff</h3>
<p>[United Press, Brazilian Capital, 6th] President Truman's visit to Brazil has lasted six days and is about to return to the United States. Today, he and several others rode in a large open White House black car to climb the mountain for lunch at the home of Brazilian businessman Fontes. On the way, the car wheel suddenly slipped off and almost had an accident. However, Truman remained calm and smiled and asked reporters and photographers to help push the car back so that they could continue. Reporters saw that the left rear wheel of the car was resting on the curb, only two feet away from the cliff, which can be said to be extremely dangerous.</p>
<h3>Political Situation in Eastern European Countries is Confusing and Unpredictable; British and American Policies are Inconsistent; US Dislikes Britain's Policy Towards the Soviet Union Having Too Much Appeasement Color</h3>
<p>[United Press, Vienna, 6th] United Press reporter Roberts reported that diplomatic observers have found that the differences between Britain and the United States on policies towards Eastern European countries are deepening, which allows the Soviet Union to take advantage of this rift to develop its plan from the Balkans to the Baltic Sea. For weeks, British and American diplomats stationed in Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria have been making relentless accusations against each other.</p>
<p>The reporter has repeatedly met with British and American diplomats during his six weeks in Eastern Europe and has gained the impression that the British think that the Americans often take irresponsible actions, while the Americans feel that Britain's policy towards the Soviet Union has too much appeasement. The British are particularly dissatisfied with the fact that some American political and military representatives often discuss the inevitability of war with the Soviet Union. Rumors that war is about to break out in Eastern Europe are spreading daily, and conservatives especially hope that the United States will rise up to "stop" the Soviet Union. After Bulgarian opposition leader Peterkov was sentenced to death, there were widespread rumors in Sofia that the United States would invade Bulgaria within a week. In addition to protesting the unfairness of the Hungarian elections and Peterkov's execution, the British representative did not take a second step. Non-official British sources estimate that the number of fraudulent votes in the general election did not exceed 200,000, which is not enough to change the result. Vienna reported that Britain and the United States have stopped exchanging political intelligence, especially information about refugees fleeing from Soviet-controlled countries. The obvious sign of the divergence of opinions between Britain and the United States is that the countries under the wings of the Communist Party have a more enthusiastic attitude towards Britain than before, and Britain also hopes to establish trade relations with these countries quickly.</p>
<h3>Trial of Japanese War Criminals Will Enter a New Stage</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] The Allied trial of Hideki Tojo and his 24 war co-conspirators is likely to enter a new stage this week, most likely next week, when each war criminal will defend himself individually. Before this stage begins, it is still necessary to wait for the President of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Webb, to stipulate the time for each war criminal to testify on the witness stand. Predictions here say that each person will have a time limit of three days to a week. If the limit is three days, the entire process will take more than ten weeks, and the time sequence has already entered December. Webb and the court judges are striving to give the war criminals a fair and speedy trial, so the court will do its best to complete the trial before the Christmas season. The order in which the war criminals will make their defenses is likely to be arranged in alphabetical order in English, so Tojo will be the second to last person to defend himself. After the defendants have finished defending themselves, the prosecutors will rebut the evidence presented by the defendants, and the defendants' lawyers may have the opportunity to rebut again, but it is generally believed that this is unlikely. Then both sides will make a brief report to the court as a whole. Because there are no jurors in the trial, there is no need to make a brief summary report to the court.</p>
<h3>International Statistical Conference Opens Today in Washington</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] More than 500 representatives from 56 countries (including China) gathered here today to participate in the International Statistical Conference that opened here on the 8th. The head of the Chinese delegation is Zhu Junyi, and the members are Jin Guoshi and Chen Da. The main purpose of this conference is to seek international statistics and standard development. According to Zhu Jun's conversation with a Central News Agency reporter, in view of the fact that this conference will discuss the population census and international income census that China itself intends to conduct, this conference will have special significance for China.</p>
<h3>Consular Corps Supervise Indonesian-Dutch Ceasefire; Five Countries Send Military Officers to Assist; Indonesian Capital's Defense Commander Changes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 6th] According to reliable sources, several members of the United Nations Consular Corps have today received instructions from their home governments to expedite the arrangements for supervising the ceasefire in the Dutch East Indies. The corps is ordered to submit a report to the United Nations Security Council before the 20th of this month. The head of the Consular Corps, US Representative Ford, convened a meeting of all representatives on the evening of the 7th. It is reported that Ford has obtained official confirmation that US military officers will come from Manila and Tokyo to assist in supervising the ceasefire.</p>
<p>One party said that each of the six countries of the Consular Investigation Team will send 80 army or navy officers for technical assistance.

<p>[United Press, Paris, 7th] French police authorities announced that a Jewish rabbi and two members of the Stern Gang underground organization have been arrested in connection with a plot to bomb London. According to the police, the rabbi attempted to drop leaflets over London from the air, while the Stern Gang members planned to bomb London in revenge for the Jewish refugees returning to Hamburg in 1947.

<h3>Four Supervisory Committee Members Arrive in Shanghai Under Order of the Yuan; Thorough Investigation of Foreign Exchange Usage; To Clarify Whether the Usage of Various Agencies and Industries is Proper; Results to be Organized and Publicly Released</h3>
<p>The Control Yuan previously dispatched Supervisory Committee members He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Guanwu, and Du Guangxun to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the use of foreign exchange by the Central Bank and the case of Yangtze, Fuchung, and other companies purchasing large quantities of luxury goods from abroad. After receiving the order, the four committee members conducted a preliminary review in Nanjing based on reports from various parties. It is now learned that, in order to conduct an on-site investigation and obtain more detailed information, the four individuals arrived in Shanghai separately from Nanjing on the 6th and are scheduled to commence their work separately starting today. The targets of the investigation are not limited, with the aim of clarifying whether various agencies and industries are using foreign exchange properly. The duration of the investigation will also depend on the needs of the actual situation. The results of the investigation will be organized and, in addition to being reported to the government, are also planned to be released publicly.</p>
<p>The District Representatives of the 30 Districts Host Chiefs; Provide Opinions on the General Election; Hope for Openness and Clarity to Establish a Good Atmosphere; Support the General Mobilization Order and Resolve to Demonstrate with Facts</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies of the thirty districts of Shanghai hosted local chiefs and members of the press at the New Life Club at 6:00 PM yesterday, both to express respect to local officials and to provide opinions on the national general election. Those in attendance included Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Bureau, representing Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Chairman Fang Qia, President Cha Liangjian, Tang Shichang representing Du Yuesheng, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan of the Municipal Assembly, and approximately 70 people including the chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the chairmen of the district mediation committees. The assembly presented the "Zhongyong Shun Song Commemorative Album" to Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, President Cha, Inspector Yan, and Director Du in appreciation of their service to the locality. During the gathering, Liu Xiexun, chairman of the people's representative assembly of the Old Zha District, delivered a welcome speech, and Ren Jinpin of the Xincheng District delivered a eulogy.</p>
<p>Self-Reliance · Do Not Seek External Assistance</p>
<p>Jiang Zhaohu of Huangpu District, the executive director of the Federation, then explained several points of opinion regarding the reception: (A) Regarding the election of legislators and National Assembly representatives, it is hoped that: (1) A good atmosphere will be established, and economy will be promoted, and any form of bribery, such as using banquets, will be rejected. (2) The election should be open and transparent, with public speeches to the district residents, and the people should have a clear understanding of politics. (3) Participants should explain in detail their past political achievements and not just report their resumes. (4) It is hoped that intellectuals and those qualified to be elected will participate more. (B) The special envoy Wei Demai did not contact the real representatives of the people during his visit to China, and he criticized our people, which seems unreasonable. Although he collected a lot of information, it was all personal complaints from those who "sue to foreigners," so the district people's representative assemblies must express several opinions: (1) We do not want to beg for money from the United States. The United States should help China as a moral act, and loans should not damage China's sovereignty. (2) The United States' Far East policy clearly abandons China and holds on to Japan, a phenomenon that will inevitably repeat the Pearl Harbor incident. Our people must be self-reliant and not rely on external forces.</p>
<p>Unity From Top to Bottom · Achieve Prosperity</p>
<p>(3) Support the general mobilization order. (4) We ourselves must be determined to answer the criticism of others with facts. On the one hand, we must report corruption, and we ask the Shanghai authorities to lead us in a spiritual counterattack. The cooperation of the people depends on whether the authorities cooperate. (C) Regarding the local autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government, the government does not pay much attention to it and must strive for it. Local autonomy should begin with cities, not with rural counties, and constitutional government should also be carried out from the bottom up. The district people's representative assembly should be a legal entity.</p>
<p>Then Chairman Fang delivered a speech, briefly stating: I have been in Shanghai for eleven months, but I have not done my best for the citizens and people's representatives of Shanghai, which I feel ashamed of, but I believe that my colleagues have done their best. In the future, I hope that the representatives will encourage me more, and that we will unite as a whole from top to bottom to achieve prosperity in this city. I believe that Wei Demai's judgment is due to insufficient understanding and too little contact with the people. Chinese affairs must be resolved by the Chinese themselves. I will accept the proposed election opinions.</p>
<p>Assembly Hopes · Exchange of Views</p>
<p>Later, Speaker Pan delivered a brief speech stating: The constitution only stipulates "to be determined by law separately" regarding the local autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government, and the status of these municipalities has not been determined, and the number of representatives produced is small. The Autonomy Committee of the Municipal Council has printed and organized the draft general rules for the autonomy of provinces, counties, municipalities directly under the central government, and ordinary cities issued by the central government, which will be discussed at the current assembly. It is hoped that the district people's representative assemblies will provide opinions.</p>
<p>It is indeed regrettable to issue a statement regarding the results of the Wei Demai investigation team's visit to China. The General Assembly of the Municipal Council will be held soon, and it is hoped that the district people's representatives will exchange views with the Council as much as possible before the meeting so that municipal construction can be promoted and developed.</p>
<h3>The City's Various Motorized Junk Companies Refused Membership in the Shipping Association; Jointly Submit Petition to the Social Bureau; Requesting Rectification</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In this city, motorized junks (i.e., diesel engine vessels) were active along the Yangtze River coast after the victory, when various shipping companies had not yet restored their operations. The total number of these junks was about two to three hundred. After the restoration of various shipping lines, they gradually changed routes, and there are still more than a hundred vessels remaining. Approximately seventy or more companies have been formally established. Several months ago, they applied to the Shipping Business Association for membership, but the association shelved the application for several months. Later, on July 28th, they stated: "Resolved by the 24th joint meeting of directors and supervisors that all motorized junks and vessels with a total tonnage of less than 200 tons and a true horsepower of less than 200 horsepower do not need to join the association," etc.</p>
<p>Various motorized junk operators believe that there is no sufficient reason for the association to refuse their membership and submitted a petition to the Social Bureau on the 20th of last month by seventy companies including Willy Shipping, Sitong Shipping, and Zhenxingren Shipping, stating five reasons why the association's actions were inappropriate and requesting rectification. The general idea is: Motorized junks are no different from ships. According to the Maritime Law and the Shipping Law, and the measures for the competent Ministry of Communications and the Shipping Administration Bureau to issue various permits for shipping operations, the handling methods are clearly the same. The association's decision to limit the total tonnage to 200 tons and the horsepower to less than 200 horsepower is unfounded and inconsistent with the law. Even in terms of the association's articles of association, there is no provision for the above-mentioned restrictions. Now, modifying the articles of association based solely on the resolution of the directors and supervisors is inconsistent with the law. There are already many members with the same qualifications, and some members are purely agents and do not own their own ships, but they are allowed to join. Although motorized junk companies are different from large shipping companies, their business operations are no different, and joining the association would not be detrimental to the industry. Why are they being rejected? etc.</p>

All military and political units in this city have received this order.</p>
<h3>Two Inches of Rain; Weather Turns Cool</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The weather in this city suddenly turned cool last night, with strong winds and showers yesterday morning. According to the Meteorological Observatory, this was caused by the contact between the Siberian anticyclone and the Pacific tropical air mass near the East China Sea. This air mass is now gradually moving towards Japan, and it is expected that cloudy weather will continue to envelop this city for several days. After the northwest wind stops, the temperature will rise again, but the maximum temperature is not expected to exceed 95 degrees, so the hot season of this year has passed. The rainfall yesterday morning was 2.1 inches, and the crops are in dire need of water. With this moisture, a bumper harvest can be expected this autumn.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory's forecast for Shanghai's weather today: Cloudy, turning cooler, with fog in the morning and evening, moderate west to north wind. Yesterday's highest temperature was 83 degrees, and the lowest was 74 degrees.</p>
<h3>Tea Merchant, Fearing Punishment, Mistress Takes Own Life; Cohabitation Without Wedding; Breaking Promise Leads to Tragedy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Chen Mengzhong, the owner of the East China Tea Company, 40 years old, from Zhenhai, fell in love with a female employee, Chen Yanya (31 years old, from Ningbo), several years ago and cohabited at No. 41 Chengqing Lane, Shunchang Road, without holding a wedding. Recently, after repeated urging from Wuya, Chen had agreed to choose a date for the ceremony. However, when Mengzhong's brother arrived from the countryside, he was opposed to it, explaining that he already had a wife in the countryside and that marrying Chen Yanya would constitute bigamy. Mengzhong then stopped the process. When Yanya learned of this, she questioned Chen Mengzhong at 3:00 AM yesterday, and an argument ensued, during which the woman swallowed ten sleeping pills. Chen then hired a car to take her to the hospital for treatment, but due to the excessive overdose, she had not yet escaped danger as of midnight yesterday.</p>
<h3>Preferential Treatment Money for Recruits to be Collected Immediately</h3>
<p>The Preferential Treatment Committee of the Shanghai Military Service Association held a committee symposium at the garden hall of the Kangle Restaurant on Nanjing West Road at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the preferential treatment of volunteer soldiers. Those in attendance included Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xie Renzhao, Wang Xianqing, Xu Jiyin, Zhang Xiaosong, and representatives from various industrial and commercial groups, totaling more than 60 people, presided over by Pan Gongzhan. After Pan's speech, Zhang Xiaosong reported on the situation of recruiting volunteer soldiers, briefly stating: Since being ordered to handle the registration of volunteer soldiers, participation has been very enthusiastic, especially in Hongkou and Old Zha districts, which have achieved the best results. The first batch of 1,000 people will be sent to the division management area on the 15th, and all will be sent in three batches. Then, Du Yuesheng, Xie Renzhao, Xu Jiyin, etc., gave speeches one after another. The meeting decided: (1) The preferential treatment money for draftees whose conscription has been deferred and the preferential treatment money for non-conscripted draftees will be collected immediately, and the funds will be turned over to Zhejiang Industrial Bank and China Remittance Bank. (2) The 12 billion yuan for the settlement expenses of 3,000 volunteer soldiers will be raised by each committee member, who will be responsible for raising 100 million yuan. Before the funds are fully raised, they will be borrowed without interest from the municipal banks, cooperative treasuries, and the Four Banks and Two Bureaus.</p>

<p>Serving Soldiers in Transit</p>
<p>After the recent reorganization of the Shanghai Women's Association, Dr. Zheng Yuxiu took office as the chairman of the board. In addition to regularly seeking the welfare of women and organizing relief efforts, she also organized sewing and writing teams to serve soldiers in transit. Yesterday, they departed for places such as the Jiangwan Stadium. Zhang Hongbei, the executive director of the association, served as the general captain, and Fang Yingda, Zou Qinping, Cheng Hailun, and Xie Yonghua served as the team leaders. More than 40 members were mobilized to go to the work locations and write letters home and sew for the soldiers in transit, with great enthusiasm and as if they were family members.</p>

<h3>Raw Alum Material Increases Threefold; Water Prices to Rise; Under Study; Pudong Power Plant Requests Subsidies</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new foreign exchange control measures, the central authorities stipulated that liquid fuels such as gasoline and diesel oil can no longer be settled at official prices, so the prices of liquid fuels have soared. It is learned that the Shanghai Pudong Electric Company, which had previously purchased diesel oil at the official foreign exchange rate, has exhausted its supply. Since the beginning of this month, the purchase price of the diesel oil used has increased, resulting in increased costs and excessive losses, which has become unbearable. Therefore, the company recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, requesting subsidies for the loss. According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, he told reporters that the company's request for subsidies will first be investigated for its oil consumption, and then a decision will be made on whether to allocate official-priced fuel or provide subsidies. It is also learned that the water companies are currently requesting the Public Utilities Bureau to immediately adjust the selling price because the raw materials required by each company, mainly alum, are not allowed to apply for official foreign exchange, and the market price has soared by three times. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain the current selling price of tap water. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is also studying this issue.</p>
<h3>One Yuan Notes Difficult to Obtain</h3>
<p>Zhou Canhai, the owner of Shuntai Hardware Store at No. 44 Yuegui Lane, Guangdong Road, recently sued Zhou Juru of Jinchang Iron Works at the intersection of Beijing Road and Shandong Road in court for spreading rumors and slandering. After three court hearings by the prosecutor, it was found that Zhou was indeed intentionally defaming and spreading rumors, and a public prosecution was filed, which was transferred to the court for trial. The judge asked Zou if he had any demands. Zou said that the loss of money was a small matter, but he had to compensate for the loss of reputation by one yuan. Because Zhou found it difficult to find one yuan, he changed the compensation to one Mexican silver dollar. Zou insisted on one yuan note, so Zhou finally managed to obtain one yuan note before the case was closed.</p>
<p>Seeking Compensation for Reputation; The Purpose is Not Money</p>
<h3>Two More Beijing-Shanghai Night Express Trains to be Added</h3>
<p>Revised Timetable Starting Next Month</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration has recently begun revising the train schedule, which will take effect on October 1st, in order to meet the convenience of passengers as the weather turns cooler and daylight saving time is about to end. Also, the bureau has decided to add two direct Beijing-Shanghai night express trains to alleviate the excessive crowding of passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai line. The seat cushion equipment of these passenger cars is modeled after the American semi-reclining style and is currently being rushed to be manufactured by the Qishuyan Rolling Stock Plant. It is expected to be completed before the end of this month, and it is hoped that it can be officially put into operation when the new schedule takes effect on October 1st.</p>

<h3>Bandit Forces Rampant in Southern Anhui Counties; Huining Fellow Townsmen Hold Emergency Meeting; Urge Ministry of National Defense to Deploy Large Army to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>The bandit atmosphere is very strong in the counties of southern Anhui, especially in Huizhou and Ningguo. They have twice invaded Jixi County, and in Jingxian and Taiping County, they occupy the four villages, making it impossible to implement government orders. Bandit police are still frequent in the counties of Xiuning and Yi County, and the future troubles are worrying. The Huining Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai held an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Cao Zhigong. It was resolved: (1) to establish a Local Public Security Promotion Committee, with Yang Xiaotian, Cao Zhigong, Xie Renzhao, Fang Weiping, Cheng Haifeng, Zhang Yizhai, Hu Huanwen, Zheng Zhiliang, Shao Yiqun, etc., as 15 members, and Yang Xiaotian as the director and Cao Zhigong and Zhang Yizhai as the deputy directors; (2) to recommend Cao Zhigong and Xie Renzhao as two representatives to petition the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing as soon as possible and dispatch a large army to suppress the bandits; (3) to send letters to the special commissioners and county governments of the two counties, asking them to establish self-defense organizations as soon as possible and jointly prevent and suppress the bandits.

<h3>Main Focus of TB Prevention is Isolation; Special Weekly Broadcast for This Newspaper; Speech by Hospital Director Zhu of the Public Welfare Hospital</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, this newspaper held its 23rd special weekly broadcast at the Oriental Hua Mei Radio Station and invited Dr. Zhu Yanggao (pictured), director of the Public Welfare Hospital, to broadcast: "My Views on TB Prevention." The following is a record of the six points of his speech:</p>
<p>"Tuberculosis is the most cruel disease in the world, the great enemy of mankind. No disease makes us doctors feel as difficult as tuberculosis. Without mentioning the situation in foreign countries and the overall situation in our country, just taking Shanghai as an example, it can be said that people with tuberculosis are working in almost every profession. If tuberculosis patients do not infect others, the problem is not so serious and can be solved gradually. However, when a tuberculosis patient breathes, through the medium of air, he infects his friends, his close associates, unknowingly harming not only himself but also his relatives and friends. This is a very serious problem. Therefore, the main task of TB prevention is to examine many people who are suspected of having tuberculosis. If it is confirmed that they have tuberculosis, they should be isolated from their relatives and friends so that they will not infect others. This is the first step in TB prevention.</p>
<p>Two Types of Examination</p>
<p>The general examination is roughly divided into two types: (1) X-ray examination, (2) sputum examination. X-ray examination can only reveal whether there are any lesions in the lungs. To check whether there are bacteria in the sputum, further sputum examination is required. Many patients with mild lung disease have no tuberculosis bacteria in their sputum. Such people are not in danger of infecting others and do not need to be isolated. However, if the sputum examination results show that there are indeed bacteria, then such people must be isolated immediately. However, this method also has difficulties, namely, what to do after the patients whose sputum contains tuberculosis bacteria are isolated. Some tuberculosis patients are not unaware that their disease can infect others, but for the sake of livelihood, they have to conceal their symptoms and work hard. Doctors advise them to rest and isolate themselves from society, but the family's livelihood becomes a problem. How can they rest in peace? This is a practical difficulty.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Livelihood</p>
<p>Regarding this point, it does not fall within the responsibility of the doctor. The doctor's responsibility is only to find the cause of the disease and treat the symptoms. As for further social problems, the cooperation of all sectors of society is needed. For example, if agencies, organizations, factories, and businesses discover that an employee has tuberculosis, they should, on the one hand, advise him to actively seek treatment and not delay it, and on the other hand, provide a proper arrangement for his family's livelihood, so that he will not lose his job due to recuperation or affect his family's livelihood due to unemployment. The main task of TB prevention is to isolate patients from healthy people so as not to expand the spread. However, once isolated, they cannot produce. If there is no way to take care of them afterwards, the patients will still not be able to recuperate in peace and will inevitably support their sick bodies and work hard, which will still infect others. Therefore, it is an effective prerequisite for TB prevention for the heads of agencies, organizations, factories, and businesses to provide livelihood guarantees to employees with tuberculosis during the treatment period. This is beyond the power of doctors. I would like to take this opportunity to urge all sectors of society to pay attention to this and promote the spirit of human mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Do Not Be Afraid</p>
<p>As for the medical community, research on tuberculosis is constantly evolving. If patients receive treatment early, the disease is not hopeless. It is hoped that tuberculosis patients will not be afraid psychologically. Although we dare not say that we are 100% confident in eradicating tuberculosis, if all sectors of society can unite and are determined to eradicate it, we will definitely achieve the goal. I am now providing the main task of TB prevention, isolation, to all sectors of society, and I hope that everyone will sincerely declare war on tuberculosis bacteria and not stop until the goal of victory is achieved."</p>

<h3>Silk Weaving Factory Workers' Strike in Pudong: Method of Handling to Be Discussed This Morning; Unions in Districts Two and Three Prevent Spread</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The workers of more than twenty silk weaving factories in Pudong continued their strike yesterday. In addition to making every effort to persuade workers to resume work, the Industry Union of Silk Weaving in District Four will hold a meeting of factory representatives at 9:00 a.m. this morning to discuss how to handle the situation. When the workers of various factories stopped working the day before yesterday, the union was unaware of it beforehand. After hearing the news, it immediately notified the workers of each factory to work as usual, but the workers still did not resume work yesterday.</p>
<p>Although the Industry Unions of Silk Weaving in District Two (South Shanghai) and District Three (West Shanghai) feel dissatisfied with the wage discount method decided by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, they stated that workers in each factory will continue to produce as usual until they receive notification from the Evaluation Committee. At the same time, in order to prevent the spread of the labor unrest, they have made appropriate preparations. The union also hopes that the authorities can revise and improve the inappropriate aspects of the wage discount method.</p>
<p>The Social Bureau and the General Labor Union are paying close attention to the sudden strike of some silk weaving factory workers in Pudong and have sent personnel to investigate.</p>
<p>According to some employers, the wage discount method decided by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee is quite beneficial to employees, because the current difficulties and unsustainable situation of the silk weaving industry are indeed true. The sudden strike of some workers in factories in Pudong is speculated to be a "demonstration" because they suspect that the employers cannot afford the wage discount method, expressing the workers' dissatisfaction with the method.</p>
<h3>How Many Abandoned Women! Over Three Hundred Cases in Three Months</h3>
<p>Shanghai, known as the "Ten-Mile Foreign Concession," sees easy unions between men and women, but the number of divorces and abandonments is also not small. Some women with a higher social status have the means to hire lawyers and resort to law, and it is not difficult to be granted a sum of living expenses to support their old age. The most bitter are the wives of general poor and salaried classes. Once abandoned by their husbands, they immediately lose their livelihood and become pitiful insects in the vast sea of people, most of whom turn to the Shanghai China Relief Society for Women and Children for relief. According to Mr. Ding Hao, the secretary director of the society, and Mr. Zhou Naihao, the general manager, "In the past three months, the society has provided relief to more than 300 cases of abandoned women."</p>
<h3>Announcement of the List of Admitted Junior Tax Officials</h3>

<h3>Counterfeit Liushen Pills: Suspect Admits to Years of Forgery</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Liushen Pills produced by the Lei Yunshang Chinese Medicine Store have long been famous everywhere, with a history of more than 300 years, leading to covetousness by unscrupulous people who often counterfeit them for profit. Recently, the store received another secret report. Therefore, on the 4th, it reported to the police station, which, together with criminal officers from the Jiangning Road Police Sub-Bureau, arrested two suspects, Qi Wenhua and Lu Fusheng, at No. 811, Jiangbian Road, for counterfeiting the wooden bottle model for the drug.

<h3>Electric Pole on Zhapu Road Bridge Snaps, Injuring Three Pedestrians</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] At about 5:15 p.m. yesterday, an electric pole on the south side of the Zhapu Road Bridge suddenly snapped, injuring three pedestrians on the spot. Yang Xiaofa, 29, and Wang Damao, 46, both suffered head injuries, and Gao Shilong, 45, suffered a fractured left foot. All were taken to Gongji Hospital by the police on duty for treatment.</p>
<h3>Gramophone Record Industry Declining: Radio Replaces Its Position; Producers and Distributors Plan to Operate Sidelines</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] The golden age of the gramophone and record industry in Shanghai ten years ago has become a thing of the past. There are fewer and fewer customers, and machine and record merchants are worried about the accumulation of unsold products. Smarter merchants are planning or have already started to operate electrical materials, radios, or other sidelines.</p>
<p>Today, radio has replaced the position of gramophone records, and the gramophone is approaching the edge of decline.</p>
<p>Two to Three Million Records Pressed Monthly</p>
<p>The Changming and Decheng factories in Shanghai, which manufacture gramophones, take the manufacture of cuckoo clocks as their main business and electric lights and electrical materials as their sideline, respectively. This can still barely help maintain the production of gramophones. The Baidai and Great China companies, which produce records, accept commissions from Victory, Shangting, and Beikai in addition to their own products, and the latter accepts commissions from Baige, Emei, and Xingyue to release records. Currently, the number of records pressed by all parties each month is between 20,000 and 30,000, only one-fifth of the number pressed each month before the war. These 20,000 to 30,000 records are distributed to Bao Fang, Xinsheng, Dasheng, Tiansheng, Baisheng, Gesheng, and the four major companies, among others, for retail sale. It is said that many of these pitiful numbers cannot be sold each month.</p>
<p>Sales Decline Sharply to Only One-Fifth</p>
<p>Before the war, imported foreign records were all managed by Baidai Company. The American Columbia Company and the British Victory Company also had considerable sales in China, especially in Shanghai. Now, it can be said that there are no imports at all. This is not due to import restrictions, but to the decrease in the number of people willing to purchase gramophone records.</p>
<p>Speaking of the sales of machines and records, in addition to the large volume of retail sales in Kyoto, Shanghai, and various places in Jiangnan, the wholesale business in North China, Tianjin, Wuhan, Sichuan, Henan, Shaanxi, Jinan, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and even Southeast Asia was very common. However, it is said that these wholesale businesses only account for one-fifth of the pre-war level, and the retail volume in the Kyoto-Shanghai area is very small.</p>
<p>High Costs Also a Major Reason</p>
<p>The first difficulty in the record industry is that transportation has not been restored, and finished products cannot be sold to other places in large quantities. The second is that local records are developed and cannot be widely sold. As for the high cost of production, it is also a major reason. In addition to the required materials and labor, the copyright alone used to be 1,000 yuan for Dr. Mei and Ma Lianliang to jointly press a record of *Killing the Fisherman*. Now, if you want to press a record of a famous Peking Opera actor, the cost for the first two months is about more than 10 million yuan, and you have to give away dozens of records. Therefore, popular song records are currently popular because the cost of pressing is lower, and there are no restrictions from famous Peking Opera or other local opera actors. However, the lifespan of popular songs is short. New compositions appear at any time for songs that are popular for a while, and old records have to be piled on the shelves and let them be covered in dust.</p>
<p>I heard the sigh of the gramophone and record industry!</p>
<h3>South Shanghai Vehicle Ferry: Can Be Opened to Traffic on National Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Since the Shanghai Ferry Company took charge of promoting the South Shanghai Military Vehicle Ferry project, the results have been good. According to the person in charge of the company, if there are no shutdowns due to storms, strikes, or other accidents, it should be open to traffic on October 10. The pile-driving and approach bridge project on the Pudong side has been completed. The steel bridge and crane can be installed. The floating bridge and loading barge will be installed by the end of this month. As for the dredging on the Puxi side, it has also been completed. The approach bridge project is limited to completion before the 10th of this month. It is reported that after the completion of the entire project, its transportation function may be difficult to fully develop in the initial stage. The company has decided to continue to improve it, and its goals are determined as follows: (1) The ferry uses landing craft that have been converted for transitional use, and in the future, special designs must be adopted, using those that travel at both ends. (2) The crane currently uses a truck and relies on manual rotation, which must be converted to motorized in the future. (3) The embankments on both sides are very thin and should be rebuilt and deepened in the future to facilitate dredging and navigation. (4) The roads in Pudong must continue to be completed.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship: Hoping for Generous Donations; Statistics of Needy Students in Various Schools Show More Than 4,000 Awaiting Assistance</h3>
<p>In order to investigate and count the number of poor students in this city who are unable to attend school due to their poor family backgrounds and urgently need assistance, we sent nearly 200 "School Overview Survey Forms" to major middle and elementary schools throughout the city a week ago, asking the schools to fill them out for us. Because this kind of survey work can enable us to determine the number of recipients and the budget for scholarships, so that the work can be carried out.</p>
<p>Thanks to the enthusiastic assistance of major middle and elementary schools throughout the city, this complicated survey work will soon be completed. To date, four-fifths of the "Survey Forms" have been returned to us. We have classified, organized, and finally obtained a shocking result. This result tells us that the number of students in the city who need assistance from our newspaper is at least more than 4,000. This number is a rock-solid fact displayed in front of us. If each person is given an average scholarship of 700,000 yuan, the total amount will be 2.8 billion yuan, but we only plan to approve 1,500 people, which will require 1.05 billion yuan.</p>
<p>It has been a full sixteen days since our newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund" began soliciting donations. The amount of donations received is only more than 40 million, plus the 300 million yuan that our newspaper has committed, there is still a long way to go from the goal of 1.05 billion yuan. In fact, these numbers are indeed of no help.</p>
<p>The above numbers clearly tell us, and at the same time tell the public, that the future effectiveness of the "Reader Scholarship Fund" still depends on everyone's efforts. This effort will bring a bright future to countless poor students!</p>
<h3>Communist Bandit Organization Cracked Down in Pudong: Five Key Leaders Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters Investigation Department recently cracked down on a secret communist bandit organization in Pudong, arresting five key communist bandit leaders on the spot.

<h3>Building a Good Environment in the Northeast: Undertaking Fundamental Treatment Work; A Conversation with Director Chen Jian Upon His Arrival</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Yuchen said: Xiong Shihui is an internist, please let Director Chen Jian be a surgeon to operate on the malignant tumor in the Northeast!</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 7th] At the tea party held by Director Chen Jian to entertain representatives of civil production institutions yesterday, Ma Yuchen said in his speech: Xiong Shihui is an internist, please let Director Chen Jian be a surgeon to operate on the malignant tumor in the Northeast. Everyone can be a relative and sign a letter of trust!</p>
<p>Director Chen Jian said: He will accept the opinions of the people, change the special nature of the Northeast to normal, and hopes that local people will take responsibility to remedy the deficiencies of the past fourteen years. Director Chen Jian also said: He will follow Chairman Chiang's will to make the Northeast a Three Principles of the People experimental zone.</p>
<p>Director Chen Jian also said: Everyone hopes that I will operate on corruption and other matters. I will build a good environment as a fundamental cure. Those who should be operated on will definitely be operated on, but there are ultimately few bad people, so don't fall for the Communist Party's divisive schemes.</p>

<h3>With the General's Arrival in Shenyang, the People of the Northeast Feel Open and Bright</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 3rd, Air Dispatch] September 1st is our reporters' holiday, and it was a clear day with oriental colors after days of continuous rain. On this day, we were happy and busy, so we had no time to think about celebrating the holiday. The Pan City field reporters had already been attracted to the Beiling Airport by the news of Chief Chen's arrival in Shenyang.</p>
<p>Little Girl Presents Flowers</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m., the silver wings of the "Chasing Spirit" special plane slowly landed. As the door opened, Chief Chen got off the plane with a smile, exchanged greetings with Director Xiong, and accepted the flower presented by a little girl, repeatedly saying "Thank you" endlessly. When he shook hands with Zhang Zuoxiang and Wang Shuhan, elders of the Northeast who were nearly sixty years old, he repeatedly said "I don't deserve it, I don't deserve it."</p>
<p>Director Chen Jian and former Director Xiong rode in the same car to the Second Guest House of the Municipal Headquarters. The people and students who stood to welcome them along the way showed their bright mood on their smiling faces.</p>
<p>Before and after the Communist bandits launched five offensives, the hearts of the people in the Northeast were once in a state of distress. Chief Chen's arrival in Pan made the depressed hearts of the people feel open and bright, because everyone knew Chief Chen's straightforward style and hoped that he could make drastic reforms in all aspects of politics, military affairs, and economy in the Northeast to save the crisis in the Northeast and satisfy all the hopes of the people in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Proficient in Military and Political Affairs</p>
<p>Regarding the changes in the Northeast situation, former Director Shihui said frankly: "In the past, the Northeast Headquarters carried out the work of receiving in a peaceful and diplomatic manner, so the Political and Economic Committees were established. In the past two years, the situation has changed, and we have to pay attention to military affairs." Director Xiong's two years of diligent efforts and the peaceful diplomacy he used were greatly challenged due to the Soviet Union's breach of faith and the Communist bandits' forces also took the opportunity to grow. The central government could not sit idly by and watch the situation in the Northeast deteriorate day by day, so it had to change its policies and practices in the Northeast to save the overall situation. Therefore, it changed the policy in the Northeast and sent Chief Chen, who is proficient in military affairs and also good at politics, to preside over the overall plan for the Northeast. On the day he took over on September 2, Chief Chen said: "The problem in the Northeast is not only a problem of China's safety, but also a problem related to world peace."</p>
<p>The local *Central Daily News* hailed him as "a figure of a new stage" the day after Chief Chen arrived in Shenyang, because he has the discernment of scissors, the courage of iron, and the confidence of steel, as well as the commanding power of wind. His integrity and fortitude are admired by the youth of the whole country, and his strategy and revolutionary spirit are admired by people inside and outside the party.</p>
<p>National Army Gains the Upper Hand</p>
<p>From the strengthening of military affairs in the Northeast to the reform of politics and the reform of the economy, the veins are consistent. We can see that all military victories are a prerequisite. This is also what Director Chen Jian has been actively planning before and after his arrival. It is generally believed that the war in the Northeast will inevitably break out in mid-September, and the National Army will take the initiative to gain the upper hand. The initial actions of the National Army will be to eliminate the communist bandits in southern Liaoning and the AnDong-MeiHeKou area, and then point the army north along the Middle East Railway, directly attacking the communist bandits' nerve center in Harbin and the armory in Jiamusi, and fully recover northern Songjiang.

<h3>Reveling in the Dance Hall: Disregarding the Lives of Patients; "Famous Doctor" in Fuzhou Accused</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 2nd] Cao Can, a commissioner of the Fujian Provincial Government Commissioner's Office, is nearly sixty years old and has an only son, Zhiyu, who is only seven years old. A few days ago, he felt unwell. Therefore, in the afternoon when his illness began, he invited Fang Shengzhen, a famous pediatrician in the city, to treat him. After Fang slightly diagnosed him, he first thought it was *ganji* (infantile malnutrition), and then thought it was heatstroke. He immediately prescribed a prescription, first taking castor oil, and then medicine and powder. At that time, Cao's wife believed that her son was already suffering from severe diarrhea, and according to her common sense, it did not seem appropriate to take castor oil. She asked the doctor to examine him properly, but Dr. Fang did not take it seriously and instructed her to prescribe the medicine according to the prescription immediately. Cao and his wife had no choice but to follow the doctor's instructions. However, on the evening of the same day, the child's symptoms changed after taking the medicine. The diarrhea worsened, his hands were cold, and he was delirious. Cao rushed to Dr. Fang's residence, where Dr. Fang was having fun in the dance hall as usual, dancing. After a dance ended, Cao stepped forward and explained the child's evening symptoms, but Fang suddenly told him that it was okay to have heatstroke and told him to return to his residence. At night, the child's condition worsened. At about 2:00 a.m., Cao asked Fang to come to his residence for treatment again. At this time, Fang believed that it was meningitis. Cao asked for emergency treatment, but Fang was unwilling to do so immediately. After a while, the child died. Cao and his wife suddenly suffered the pain of losing their son in their old age, and were greatly devastated. They believed that Fang's love for dancing delayed matters and disregarded human life, and should be held liable for business negligence. Therefore, they filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, requesting that this quack doctor be punished to serve as a warning. It is heard that Fang also admitted that he did indeed have faults that led to the death of the person.</p>
<h3>Lai Shuangxi in Taitung: Old National Hero; Seventy-Six Years Old; Teeth Fallen Out, Hearing Impaired; Still Rides a Bicycle; Visits Wei Daoming</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taitung, 5th, Air Dispatch] This reporter accompanied Chairman Wei on his tour of Taitung and met Lai Shuangxi, a 76-year-old national hero from Pingtung. When the Japanese attacked Taiwan more than 50 years ago, he, as a 24-year-old youth, rose up and called on his comrades to fight guerrillas with the Japanese. As a result, he retreated into the mountains and did not leave the mountains to farm until 1916. He rode his bicycle to visit Chairman Wei, repeatedly saying: "Very good! Very good!" His teeth have fallen out and he has hearing impairment, but his spirit is exceptionally good. Director Zhu of the Civil Affairs Department was so excited that he just nodded. Looking at the back of this elder who had spent 52 difficult years, I was also in awe for a long time. (Reporter Yang Yu)</p>

<h3>Lushan Gleanings</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Kuling dispatch on the 5th] Since the opening of the Nanxun Railway, the once bustling Nanxun Highway, crowded with vehicles, has become desolate. However, the troops stationed along the road for inspection and registration have not diminished their past imposing presence. On the short 190-kilometer Nanxun road, apart from the highway management stations that should regulate traffic, the security teams' inspections cause endless trouble for travelers. The so-called road protection troops' inspections, other than providing them with the convenience of free rides, have not achieved the desired effect on road safety. Because inspection is inspection, and banditry is banditry. Moreover, they also levy an inexplicable registration fee. Once, Chairman Wang Lingji's car was forced to pay a registration fee of three thousand yuan at the road protection team's checkpoint while passing through Zhang Gongbo. This incident was then exposed, and the practice was ordered to be stopped.</p>
<p>Zhang Gongdu is the midpoint of the Nanxun Highway. Cars traveling between Nanxun often have lunch there. In the past, it was as prosperous as before the war, but now it is quiet as a graveyard. Apart from a few small restaurants that are fortunate enough to sell a few cups of boiled water or a simple meal each day, the other shops are all closed. The only hope of the local people now is that the Gan-E Highway will be opened to traffic. They place their hopes for prosperity on the Gan-E road. However, the completion of this road will probably take quite some time.</p>
<p>The remnants of Li Xiannian's troops from the Communist Central Plains Military Region, about two hundred people, armed with six small cannons and more than ten light machine guns, moved from Hubei Province to the north bank of the Yangtze River in northern Jiangxi in mid-August, attempting to operate along the riverbank and loot the autumn harvest. Peng Xiuye, a former investigator from the Fourth Section of the Security Department, is also recruiting local ruffians and vagrants, armed with more than forty rifles and two light machine guns, to operate on the Nanxun Highway. In mid-August, De'an County was once in a state of emergency. The authorities should immediately search for and eliminate these scattered bandits in a timely manner. (Reporter Liu Zao)</p>
<p>Zhejiang Water Conservancy Bureau Investigates Disaster and Requests Appropriation for Relief</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Hangzhou dispatch on the 7th] The Zhejiang Water Conservancy Bureau has sent personnel to investigate the details of the disaster situation in the entire province. Statistics show that the disaster area accounts for one-third of the entire province, mostly coastal counties, totaling twenty-nine counties. Nine counties, including Sanmen, Ruian, Ninghai, Huangyan, Linhai, Wenling, Jiaxing, Xiangshan, and Zhengxian, suffered from armyworm plagues. Eighteen counties, including Xianju, Yueqing, Yongjia, Pingyang, Zhuji, Jiashan, Zhenhai, Deqing, Yuyao, Yuhang, Lin'an, Dinghai, Qu County, Changhua, Yuqian, Xiaoshan, Haining, and Hang County, suffered from drought. Sheng County suffered from typhoons and drought, and Shaoxing suffered from rain, hail, and drought.

<h3>Abbot of Jiaoshan Monastery Accused of Colluding with Communists, Professor Haiji of the Buddhist Academy Offers Explanation</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Zhenjiang dispatch on the 7th] Regarding the widely spread case in Nanjing and Shanghai of the Abbot of Jiaoshan Monastery colluding with Communists, Professor Haiji of the Buddhist Academy on the mountain stated: This matter is entirely fabricated. Monk Xuefan retired in September of last year and was invited this spring to preside over the Qingliang Temple in Changzhou and Shanghai. After Monk Xuefan retired, he was suddenly arrested on August 29th and sent to the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters. This is actually an act of malicious accusation. I personally went to Beijing yesterday to request that the Xinmin Evening News correct and apologize for the report, and I also clarified the truth to the Garrison Headquarters. The Headquarters agreed to investigate. As for Monk Xuefan's arrest in Shanghai, it was due to a former monk who had been expelled from the mountain seeing the news report about Xuefan colluding with Communists and attempting to take revenge.</p>

On the 4th, at Wang Meiqiao in Zhongshanmen, they inspected more than 2,000 officers and soldiers of the entire 2nd Regiment of the 1st Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army.

<p>[Another dispatch] Xu Daxing, the director of the county education bureau, has only been in office for four months, but due to corruption, improper measures, and inappropriate words and deeds, as well as using his position for personal gain and arbitrarily transferring the principals of 198 urban and rural schools, he has stirred up an unprecedented wave in the local education sector. He has also been impeached by the first session of the county council, which unanimously passed a resolution requesting the provincial authorities to promptly dismiss him from his position and investigate. Recently, the provincial authorities have repeatedly received reports from various parties regarding Xu's arbitrary transfer of principals, causing disputes and failing to meet the expectations of the people, and have paid close attention to the matter. Chairman Wang specifically telegraphed County Magistrate Weng to investigate and respond to Xu's behavior. After receiving the telegram, Weng summoned Xu Daxing and inquired about the situation. Xu then expressed that handling affairs was difficult and that he had already considered resigning.</p>
<h3>Black Fever Spreads in Northern Anhui, Health Authorities Urgently Need to Pay Attention to Prevention and Treatment</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Bengbu dispatch on the 3rd] A type of black fever is prevalent in various parts of northern Anhui. It is spreading extremely rapidly and widely, and the number of deaths is increasing daily, which has aroused great attention from the medical community. It is reported that this type of highly contagious and malignant disease was first discovered in Huaiyin, northern Jiangsu, and soon spread to cities such as Jinan, Kaifeng, and Xi'an. After the disaster in northern Anhui, people's livelihoods are difficult, and most people are undernourished. This black fever takes advantage of the situation. The area around Si County and Su County is particularly rampant. According to people in the medical field, the source of black fever is said to be the sandfly, which is the transmission medium. The sandfly is quite similar to a midge, with a body that is yellowish in color. It sucks human blood in the same way as mosquitoes. After a person is bitten by a sandfly, red spots appear on the buttocks. The symptoms are quite similar to malaria. At first, there are alternating chills and fever, followed by a persistent fever, yellow complexion, abdominal distension, facial swelling, and bleeding gums. A foul odor is emitted during breathing. This disease is due to the lack of nutrition and weak resistance in the human body. The bacteria destroy tissues in the body, making it stubborn and terrifying. Initially, more children were affected, but recently, many adults have also been affected. Those who do not recognize the condition often mistakenly believe it to be dropsy. This disease spreads widely and quickly. Health authorities in various places should urgently pay attention to prevention. The most effective drug for treating black fever is "Neostam," a British product. Patients urgently need vitamin B, followed by vitamins A, C, and G. Xie Guanyi, Deputy Director of the Anhui Rehabilitation and Relief Branch of the Executive Yuan, inspected the flood disaster in Su County at the end of last month and witnessed many people suffering from black fever. Therefore, he paid great attention to it, and all parties also hope that the branch can provide medical relief to combat the offensive of this terrible disease.</p>

<h3>Sing Tao Loses Fifth Match - Defeated by Walton</h3>

Sing Tao's skills were all top-notch, but their shooting technique was too poor. In terms of short passes and formation, their technique was clearly superior to their opponents, but when they reached the goal area, they often hesitated, and the ball was snatched by the opponents, resulting in countless missed opportunities. The smaller stature compared to the taller defenders of the opponents was also a disadvantage. In the first half, Walton's Stephens scored a goal. Three minutes after the restart, Sing Tao's Ho Ying-Fan scored a goal. Five minutes later, Walton's Holdens scored another goal, and after that, it was Walton's game. The final result was 2-1, with Walton winning.</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Reform of the Monetary System</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the government intends to borrow US$1 billion to US$2 billion from the United States to reform the monetary system in order to stabilize finance. Domestic public opinion generally believes that a good medicine for the right disease, if taken excessively, will not only fail to cure the disease, but when it is truly needed, there will be no medicine available. Reforming the monetary system at this time, because the objective conditions are not yet ready, the effect is limited, and it is too early. It is advisable to wait until the general economic situation improves slightly before making a fundamental plan. The author, far away in Japan, also believes that this issue is of great importance to the national economy. Therefore, I would like to provide some opinions based on my usual research on this issue for the reference of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>More than two years have passed since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan. The country is in trouble everywhere, and the people are suffering. Observing the domestic situation, one cannot help but feel grief. Looking at our eastern neighbor, after the defeat in the war, they have cleaned up the aftermath and rebuilt. Their politics and economy are generally on track, and international trade has also been opened since August 15th. With a gold reserve of US$137 million as a fund, its strength is already quite strong. In addition, with the spiritual support of the United States, it feels like everything is going smoothly. The Japanese people are truly elated and full of hope. Our country and Japan are neighbors, with old grievances unresolved, and we are the first to bear the brunt.</p>
<p>The current problem in our country, broadly speaking, is only one economic problem, that is, the monetary system problem. The legal tender is entrusted with the government's credit. Since the end of the war, no concrete method of reorganization has been determined, resulting in malignant inflation, which has reached a saturation point, and a crisis has appeared, with collapse expected. The collapse of the legal tender is the total collapse of politics and economy. If, unfortunately, it reaches an irreversible state, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, if there is a good medicine for the right disease, use it at the right time. A little hesitation will lead to regret. The so-called objective conditions will not come until the credit of the monetary system is re-established, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>To re-establish the credit of the legal tender, it is necessary to start with reforming the monetary system. The current legal tender has lost its soul and cannot be saved. If we can use the greatest courage, directly and clearly, call the existing yuan note, which is actually only worth 30% of its pre-war value, a 30% legal tender, it will definitely produce a different psychological effect and boost morale. Otherwise, we will only see prices continue to rise, nerves constantly tense, trapped in a quagmire, unable to extricate ourselves. Today's banknotes are like the banknotes of the past. Calling them 30% does not make people feel the expensiveness of prices or the difficulty of life. Calling them 10,000 yuan inevitably leads to today's turmoil. Numbers are at work, playing with humanity, and the harm is so great.</p>
<p>The 10,000 yuan of the past has now been devalued to 30%. The 9,999 yuan and 70% are all consumed due to the national War of Resistance. This loss is actually shared by the people of the whole country. Hanging on to this bad debt only makes people feel alarmed. Why not write it off in one stroke and feel clean and happy? However, it should be noted that this remaining 30% must be preserved with all efforts and not allowed to fall again. The way to preserve it is to reform the monetary system and re-establish the credit of the legal tender. However, there are several issues that should be reviewed:</p>
<p>(1) The conversion rate between the new and old legal tender should be determined by economic experts based on the total amount of old currency issued and its existing purchasing power, using precise calculation methods. It should not be too high or too low. Once the ratio is determined, we can proceed to estimate the first phase of the new currency issuance and its corresponding reserve. Assuming that the ratio is 100,000 to 3, if the amount of old currency issued is 100 trillion yuan, the equivalent of new currency is only 3 billion yuan, which is approximately US$1 billion. The amount of new currency issued is greatly reduced, which makes it easier to raise the reserve.</p>
<p>(2) The issuance of new currency must have the same standard of reserve as before the war, otherwise there is no way to maintain its credit. In addition to allocating the government's existing gold and foreign exchange and the proceeds from the sale of state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to borrow tens of millions of U.S. dollars from the United States to replenish it, and managed by financial experts with the most stringent methods, and announced on a regular basis to show great trust.</p>
<p>(3) The gold and silver currently held and purchased by the Central Bank should be gradually delivered to the mint to cast coins to increase the people's belief in the new currency, but except for auxiliary coins that must be issued immediately to meet needs, gold coins should not be issued and circulated until a considerable period.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign exchange should be strictly controlled within a period of one or two years. Necessary imports should be offset by exports, adopting the principle of barter. All other unnecessary foreign exchange should be stopped from being settled and sold. In short, under no circumstances should the aforementioned reserve be used within one year.</p>
<p>(5) The old currency should be recalled in a fixed period and its circulation prohibited. For the exchanged new currency, those above a certain amount, except for the necessary living expenses and salaries, etc., which can be withdrawn in installments in proportion to the amount, the rest should be frozen for a short period to reduce the amount issued in the first phase and prevent inflation. The frozen portion should be issued registered deposit certificates by the Central Bank, with reasonable interest.</p>
<p>(6) The procedures for exchanging new currency should be simplified to avoid excessive disturbance. Money houses, commercial firms, institutions, and schools can be entrusted to manage it. If manpower is insufficient, high school students or above can be temporarily recruited to assist.</p>
<p>(7) After the implementation of the new currency, all prices should be restored to their original state one year before the War of Resistance. Rice should be 10 yuan per stone, sesame cakes and fried dough sticks should be 1 cent per piece, and cloth should be 10 cents per foot. The main food and necessary daily necessities should still be controlled in the same way as during the war. The Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Economic Affairs should dredge up sources and coordinate distribution. In order to ensure that the distribution system is free of abuses, the heads of each baojia should be ordered to complete the household survey by a certain date. This work can be temporarily recruited from students below high school and above elementary school.</p>
<p>(8) The government's finances should strive to be balanced. All military and government expenses should be temporarily disbursed according to the budget one year before the War of Resistance, and the salaries of public school personnel should also be restored to their original amounts before the war, so that life can be stabilized and corruption can be eliminated. However, those with salaries above 200 yuan should have half of their excess amount frozen for a short period, called savings, with preferential interest. If any institution has increased personnel and the old budget cannot match the current situation, it should be ordered to cut redundant personnel and adjust itself.</p>
<p>(9) The government's issued public bonds are all products of wartime. To increase the people's belief in the government and encourage investment, they should all be recognized at the original amount in new currency, but those that have reached the repayment period should be postponed for one to five years, and interest should still be paid.</p>
<p>(10) The savings deposits of the people, if the deposit period was before the war, should be repaid at the original amount of principal and interest. If the deposit period was during or after the war, it should be converted into new currency according to the sum of the annual price index. Those that have been requested in litigation and have obtained a definite judgment should be followed according to the judgment. Those whose liquidation period has expired should be postponed for one year, and then repaid in installments according to the amount. Interest should be given at the original interest rate during the postponement period. Although some banks may inevitably suffer losses by recognizing pre-war deposits in new currency, it has far-reaching significance, and the intangible gains are incommensurable. Savings deposits are mostly accumulated by the middle class, saving money and food, for the education of their children and to prevent illness and old age. Not withdrawing for ten years shows their deep belief in the legal tender. If they are repaid by converting old currency, then the hard work of the past and the expectations of many years will be lost. Afterwards, no matter how the government promotes or how the bank advertises, they will regard savings as a dangerous path and dare not try. Promoting savings is the government's only good policy to stabilize people's livelihood and stabilize the economy. Absorbing deposits is the bank's main business to use idle funds and regulate finance. Now, recognizing these deposits in new currency is tantamount to showing people that no investment is as safe and reliable as savings, which is enough to encourage depositors' interest and enhance their belief. The amount of savings deposits increases, and the credit of the new currency is established from this, which is obvious. As for the banks, since they are given the convenience of deferred repayment, they will not shake their foundations due to temporary turnover shortages. If the bank really has difficulties, the government should fully support it, so that this national policy can be implemented and achieve results.</p>
<p>(11) The government should set a purchase price to buy gold and foreign exchange from the people, but in the early stages, it should not be forced to buy. The government's economic policies over the years have repeatedly failed, which inevitably affects the people's confidence. At the time of the implementation of the new currency, the people will inevitably be wary and adopt a wait-and-see attitude in view of the painful experiences of the past. If the government forcibly nationalizes gold and foreign currency and freezes its price, the people will blame the government for confiscating their legally obtained property and generate resentment. If the government does not force the purchase, then before the credit of the new currency is established, this idle fund will inevitably seek another way out, and use it for various speculations or hoarding, thereby hindering the implementation of the new currency policy. Weighing the pros and cons, it is better to let it be natural. In this way, it is enough to show the government's utmost intention to protect the people's property, and it is also to show that the new currency has its intrinsic compensation and does not rely on the gold and foreign exchange of the people to support it. However, if someone can understand the government's good intentions, or is motivated by patriotism and voluntarily sells gold and foreign exchange to the country, or has to sell gold and foreign exchange due to urgent need for cash, the government will buy it according to regulations, pay half of the price, and freeze the remaining half for a short period, or treat it as a fixed deposit for one year or half a year and give interest. The government should refuse any spontaneous donations from the people in order to respect their dignity.</p>
<p>(12) Open gold and foreign currency deposits, guaranteeing that principal and interest will be repaid in gold and foreign currency at maturity, with no discounts. This deposit may not arouse the people's interest due to past failures, but once the credit of the new currency is established, its future is not as pessimistic as expected. The Central Bank accepts this kind of deposit and transfers it to the reserve bank for safekeeping and never uses it. Therefore, the Central Bank does not profit from accepting this kind of deposit, but also compensates it, which is not cost-effective, but in order to enhance the credit of the new currency, it should not be counted. Gold and foreign exchange are inherently inert. The reason why private investors flock to them is because they have learned from the disappearance of the credit of the legal tender and want to preserve it. Once the new economic foundation is firmly established, this inert object has no future. Depositors will inevitably scramble to convert it into new currency and deposit it in the bank to receive higher interest, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>(13) Organize industrial and commercial loans to support industries, which must be complementary to the new legal tender policy. During the transition between the old and new currencies, there may be some disturbances due to tight chips and poor turnover, which may cause a phenomenon similar to economic downturn. To prevent this adverse result, industrial and commercial loans should be continued, and objective standards should be used as the basis for approval, without any favoritism or fraud. After the war, industries were destroyed and materials were scarce. Now, due to the implementation of the new currency, it is necessary to control foreign exchange and restrict imports, and the situation will inevitably become worse. On the one hand, there is a shortage of materials, and on the other hand, purchasing power is weakened. This contradiction must be designed to be reconciled. If the policy is proper and the execution is effective, the transition period will be very short and will not lead to serious consequences.</p>
<p>(14) Strictly enforce the law and eradicate corruption, which is the key to the success or failure of the new legal tender policy. After years of war and civil unrest, the people's livelihood has declined, and the country is almost non-existent. Saving the country and surviving depends on this one action. Therefore, only success can be expected, and failure cannot be tolerated. The country's credit should not be lightly tested. Once the policy is determined, the whole country should be mobilized with an iron will to go all out. All public officials are executors of this policy. Now that their treatment has been improved and their lives can be stabilized, they should serve faithfully. If corruption is still found, they should be punished according to the law, without any favoritism. Heavy penalties should be used in troubled times. The supervisory committee should inspect various places, and the people of the whole country should cooperate fully, and report everything they know, to ensure that corruption is eradicated and discipline is revived. In any country, the law is strong when it is enforced, and the law is weak when it is not enforced. The success or failure of all events depends on execution, and policy is secondary. In the past, the government's policies were all perfect, but they ultimately failed because the execution was not effective. Now, in implementing the new policy, we should strive to correct this shortcoming and implement it strictly to achieve success.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Important Commodity Market Prices in This City for One Week (Increase/Decrease)</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Short-Term Treasury Bills - Resale Resumes Today</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance decided to sell U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills at market prices, the Central Bank has scheduled to resume sales today in 19 important areas such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The bank will telegraph the foreign exchange market price of this city to its branches in these areas before 9:30 AM every day, so that it can sell according to the exchange rate of the day.</p>
<p>In addition, whether the million-citizen bond subscription campaign launched by the Bond Sales Committee will continue is still under study. Because there are some difficulties in calculation since the sale at market prices, it can be resumed if this technical problem is solved.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Quota - Allocation Determined</h3>
<p>The import quota for artificial silk in the third quarter has been approved by the National Economic Commission as US$565,000. It is reported that the allocation of the artificial silk quota has been agreed upon by relevant parties, including the silk weaving industry and artificial silk merchants. The silk weaving industry accounts for 75%, artificial silk merchants account for 10%, and the remaining 15% is allocated by the ribbon industry, etc. According to this allocation amount, imports can be freely ordered from abroad.

<p>Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Clarification</p>
<h3>Soldier Marries New Love While Serving Away from Home: "Wife of the Resistance" Complications Arise</h3>
<p>Editor: I have several legal questions and request your newspaper to provide answers: (1) If a soldier marries while serving away from home during the War of Resistance, and it has been four years, is it legally valid for his wife at home to accuse him of bigamy? Does the crime of bigamy stand? (2) If his first wife was notified both before and after the marriage abroad, and she still accuses him of bigamy afterward, is there suspicion of intentional framing? (3) If a husband and wife have already separated and both parties have agreed, what is the difference between this and a divorce? (4) If, after the separation, the husband still bears the living expenses of his wife, does she have the right to freely dispose of her husband's property? Reader Wang Jinxiu.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia Answers] (1) If the statute of limitations has not expired, a crime has still been committed. The statute of limitations for the right to prosecute someone who commits bigamy while having a spouse is ten years. (2) If the first wife did not instigate the bigamy, even if she was notified by her husband alone, it cannot be said that she agreed. Therefore, accusing him of bigamy does not constitute suspicion of framing. (3) The difference lies in whether the marital relationship continues. "Separation" cannot be considered divorce. (4) Apart from gifts, a wife has no right to dispose of her husband's property.</p>
<h3>Reply to Liu Ping</h3>
<p>Letter received; see previous column.</p>
<p>Dear Liu Ping: Based on the facts described in your letter, we can draw the following conclusions: First, the marriage contract your father made for you when you were a child is fundamentally invalid according to Article 972 of the Civil Code, which states: "A marriage contract shall be entered into by the man and woman themselves." But this is already in the past. Second, the man's use of local evil forces to carry out a "bride kidnapping" completely violates Article 997 of the Civil Code, which clearly states: "A person who marries as a result of fraud or coercion may petition the court for rescission within six months after discovering the fraud or the cessation of the coercion." Therefore, according to your letter, this "bride kidnapping" is completely illegal and violates the law. For your future and happiness, you can petition the local court to rescind this marriage. As for the repayment of the betrothal gifts, that is fundamentally your parents' responsibility and has nothing to do with you. Wishing you happiness. Editor.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>August 25th: A Qingdao Diary</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qingge</p>
<p>Today my watch (not daylight saving time. Every year others observe daylight saving time, I insist on keeping the old time. The reason is that advancing the clock by an hour for no reason, it is clear that I wake up at nine in the morning, but with daylight saving time it is already ten o'clock, making me seem too lazy. It is clear that I go to bed at twelve o'clock, but with daylight saving time it is already one o'clock, threatening my spirit! Therefore, I stubbornly refuse to set my watch forward by an hour. This sometimes leads to mistakes, but when I have an appointment, I always try to be vigilant. My friends know my temperament and always remind me when they make an appointment: "Remember, it's our time, an hour earlier than your watch!") reads only eight o'clock, but I am already out of bed. In Shanghai, this is still the time for sound sleep.</p>
<p>First, I went to the balcony for some deep breathing, then washed up, drank a bowl of tea steeped with jasmine, smoked a Great Front Gate cigarette, and then started writing. I had originally planned to finish the remaining chapter of "Jiangshang Yan" in the morning and have a relaxing time in the afternoon. I am not sure about other things, but when it comes to finishing manuscripts, I will finish it when I say I will. I can't control anything in my life, except the pen! The pen listens to my senses, the pen obeys me most gently, and it is always consistent! Therefore, I put down my pen at half-past twelve. I sighed a relaxed and happy breath into the air, and walked out of the residence with a leisurely pace, walking to Hengtai Road. I thought to myself: Let's change to a new small restaurant, eating "Diyi Chun" all the time is getting boring.</p>
<p>As I walked, I found a small restaurant in the middle section of Liaoning Road, hanging a signboard tied with red silk, on which was written: "Dumpling King." It looked clean, so I went in. There was only one waiter, no upstairs, just one room with three tables. It was cold and quiet, not like doing business, more like a family. The landlady was wearing white silk shirt and pants, with her hair in a bun. She greeted me with a smile. I saw that one of the tables by the window already had a guest, so I had to take another adjacent table. I ordered thirty dumplings. I have really eaten a lot of dumplings in the past two days. I had dumplings for two meals the day before yesterday, but I don't feel tired of them at all. After all, I am from the North.</p>
<p>The dumplings were not ready yet, so I could only wait while smoking. The room was so quiet that it felt like a nap. Suddenly, I heard the guest at the next table speak. I glanced back and realized that he had already eaten and was just reading the newspaper. Now that he had finished reading the newspaper, he was humming a tune. Judging by his accent, he was not from Shandong, but seemed to be from Beijing. Listening more carefully, it was not a tune he was humming, but reciting Lin Daiyu's "Burial of Flowers" from "Dream of the Red Chamber," and he kept repeating it without end. My first cigarette was finished, but the dumplings had not yet arrived.</p>
<p>"Kid, go buy me a pack of cigarettes!" The man seemed to have been aroused by my smoking. He had a strong Beijing accent.</p>
<p>"What brand?" The kid seemed to be very familiar with the man, asking with a grinning face.</p>
<p>"Double Happiness."</p>
<p>The cigarettes were bought back, and the man opened them and took one out. The kid quickly went to the kitchen to get a light. At this time, the landlady seemed to be urging the dumplings for me. Only the man and I were left in the room. Taking advantage of this gap, the man said to me in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Smoke?"</p>
<p>"Thank you, I just smoked." I replied, without even daring to look up. I was a little afraid, afraid that the man was a hooligan. I was also a little embarrassed, not knowing how to deal with it.</p>
<p>The man was rejected and stopped talking. The kid and the landlady both came back. My dumplings were also ready. The man smoked his cigarettes, and I ate my dumplings. After a while, I heard the man asking the landlady:</p>
<p>"I probably spent another 200,000 this week, right?"</p>
<p>It turned out that the man was a regular customer here.</p>
<p>"Is 200,000 a lot? Eating two meals a day is less than 30,000." The landlady replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Uh!" The man grunted and said, "Today I only drank two taels of wine! Why am I so dizzy? It seems that your wine is not diluted."</p>
<p>I realized that the man was a little drunk.</p>
<p>"Look, would I dare to cheat you, an old customer!" The landlady's voice was full of laughter.</p>
<p>After a pause, the man changed the subject. He seemed to be deliberately killing time.</p>
<p>"The Double Seventh Festival passed a long time ago, and the theaters are still playing 'The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.' I don't know if there really is such a thing? It teases the young men and women until they are crying their eyes out. I think it's the fault of the novelists! They deliberately don't let people be happy, fabricating stories out of thin air, bringing troubles to people; like me, knowing it's wrong, I still can't jump out of this emotional circle." After saying this, the man stole a glance at me. He also sighed deeply, indicating that he was really troubled!</p>
<p>I had already felt it. I felt that the man had been staring at me all the time. He knew that the landlady would not understand what he was saying, so wasn't he clearly saying it to me? But I could only pretend not to hear and eat my dumplings with my head down. Sure enough, the landlady just "hmmed" and could not answer anything. So he began to recite the "Burial of Flowers" again. This time, I felt that his tone was so sad, so desolate. I found it a little funny, but also a little pitiful. When I finished eating, I paid the bill. When I stood up, I saw him walking past me to take the black suit jacket and a brand new straw hat hanging on the wall. He was wearing a white shirt, white pants, and white leather shoes. He was handsome and at most thirty years old.</p>
<p>I walked out of the restaurant, and the man followed behind me, but not too closely. This proved that he was not a bad guy. Nevertheless, I still felt a little uncomfortable, so I walked to the entrance of a bookstore and deliberately went in to stall for a while. But he did not leave or rush over, just standing far away and waiting. I had no choice but to walk out again. As I passed the entrance of Zhongzheng Park, he suddenly darted in front of me. He said timidly and still in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Let's take a walk in the shrine, it's quiet here."</p>
<p>As I turned around, the man lowered his head. He was also embarrassed, so I replied to him in an angry tone:</p>
<p>"You've mistaken me for someone else!"</p>
<p>Actually, I wanted to say: "I'm not Lin Daiyu," but I didn't. I hurried forward a few steps, and there was a rickshaw right there. I didn't bother to bargain, sat on it, told the rickshaw puller a destination, and slipped away.</p>
<p>The man did not say anything. I remember that after I scolded him, he sighed. I sat in the rickshaw and left, and my courage grew stronger. I turned back to look at him again. He was still holding the black jacket and standing in the sun! At this time, I said to myself: "What's he doing? Such a good young man (he looks like a single civil servant stranded in a foreign land), moaning without illness! Doing some crazy, meaningless, stupid things that are self-inflicted. I guess he is perhaps heartbroken, so he ran here alone to drown his sorrows! But maybe he has never been in love and is still reminiscing about the dream of love, so he recites the 'Burial of Flowers' so sentimentally, grieving for Lin Daiyu in vain. Anyway, his attitude towards life is always wrong. If I were his friend, I would definitely persuade him to be happy, but I have no interest in minding the business of a stranger."</p>
<p>Lost in thought, I unknowingly arrived at the seaside. I first took a stroll in the Seaside Park, found a clean beach, and lay down to rest. I looked out at the boundless horizon, which was only separated from the sky by a line. When there were no clouds, you simply could not distinguish which was the sea and which was the sky. Looking closely, the seawater gnawed at the beach, constantly muttering some unintelligible words, spraying some white foam.</p>
<p>The sun was scorching hot, so I walked to the "Qingdao Cafe" with dancing spirits in front. I sat down on the veranda by the sea. At this time, there were few customers, and the music had not yet started, so it was extremely quiet. I enjoyed this peace and happily ordered a small glass of brandy. I celebrated myself for finishing one thing today - the completion of "Jiangshang Yan."</p>
<p>I slowly sipped the wine, admiring the scenery of the seaside. On either side of this cafe were tall and low Western-style houses. A little further away was a green mountain, on which there were also a few sparse red-tiled Western-style houses, like a few wild roses blooming on the mountain. At this time, a few white clouds were flying in the sky, looking like willow catkins being slightly intoxicated by the breeze! On the beach under the veranda, children were carrying cotton baskets to collect clams. Men and women were bathing in the shallow water. A pair of teenagers, seemingly lovers, were fighting in the seawater. The man tried hard to press the woman's head into the water, and the woman jumped out of the water with a lunge, using her hands to splash water back at the man. The man was preparing to pounce over to press the woman's head again, but the woman laughed and turned around to escape. The man chased after her. They finally made peace and embraced each other in the seawater!</p>
<p>While I was watching with great interest, a sharp shout startled me! I quickly turned back to look. It was a young lady who was throwing a tantrum at the waiter. She was sitting at a table in front of me. I had not noticed her until now. It turned out that she had arrived even earlier than me. From her words, I could hear.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Can't customers who have eaten sit for a while longer? You quickly bring the bill to urge me. Does anyone owe you anything?" The young lady yelled in Cantonese.</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant! I saw that you had eaten and weren't ordering anything else, so I thought you were about to leave! That's why I brought the bill." A head waiter came over and repeatedly apologized to the young lady.</p>
<p>"Okay, bring me another cup of coffee, hot." The young lady ordered, her anger subsided a little.</p>
<p>Another waiter brought the coffee over. Suddenly the young lady said again:</p>
<p>"Bring me a bottle of beer too!"</p>
<p>The waiter did not dare to delay and quickly went to do as he was told. The young lady put the coffee aside and drank the beer first. I saw her drinking the wine while staring blankly at the sea and sky connecting the other corner without mountains or Western-style houses. She was also constantly smoking. So I paid attention to the ashtray in front of her. Humph! There were at least twenty cigarette butts. Of course, maybe not all of them were smoked by her, but from the time she got angry until now, it has been at most two or three ten minutes, but she has smoked more than five. I said to myself: She is more fierce than me. She is already smoking one after another. Her speed is even twice as fast as mine.</p>
<p>The young lady was not ugly, with a round face, and a pair of watery eyes, as if she were about to cry at any moment. Her eyebrows had lost their natural shape, and were trimmed so thin. Straight nose, although not too high. Small mouth, painted with bright red lipstick. Her hair had been permed a long time ago and had straightened out, draped over her shoulders. She wore a blue-and-white floral silk cheongsam, white shoes, and no socks. She was neither too thin nor too fat, and her skin was brown. She was not a student, she was quite old. Maybe she was a female teacher. I guessed. She seemed to have something on her mind, and seemed very irritable and depressed. She smoked hard and exhaled heavily, as if she wanted to exhale her distress! From time to time, she scratched her hair, and then casually pulled out a strand or two. She drank alcohol so hastily that a large glass was gone in an instant, a bottle with two large glasses. In less than twenty minutes, she swept them all away. She still swallowed that cup of cooked coffee in two or three mouthfuls. It was like using this thing to dilute her sadness!</p>
<p>"Why is she so annoyed? Is she also heartbroken?" I pondered this, and couldn't help but think of the fake Baoyu who recited the "Burial of Flowers" at noon. I thought: If I had just found such an object here, I would definitely bring that person here, so that they could sympathize with each other, and maybe they could fill some of the emptiness! However, my regret was in vain, I couldn't find that person again. Then, should I comfort this young lady? I am not afraid, and I am willing to do so, but I feel that my comfort is not what she needs! If I did this, I might just run into a wall! It's not worth it! It's better not to mind other people's business. So at this time, I didn't bother to look at any scenery, and just coldly observed her - until she collected her eyes that were looking at the sea and sky; until she finished smoking the last cigarette; until she paid the bill and stood up, and walked out staggeringly, like a rootless ghost, and walked into the dusk!</p>
<p>At this time, my brandy was also drunk, and I ordered another serving of ice cream. It was getting dark, so I also solved the dinner problem by the way. In the music, I walked back with rhythmic steps, accompanied by the moonlight.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived at the residence, the lady in the small building opposite, who seemed to be suffering from menstrual cramps forever, had already returned from work, and was "wah lah wah lah" scolding the servants again. For some reason, these days, whenever I saw her, I felt a headache, I was almost afraid of her! Her face, which always looked like someone owed her two hundred copper coins, without a trace of a smile, made you unable to avoid being shocked! Coupled with her voice, which was often a curse, made your hairs stand on end! She was simply a mad dog, who could bite people at any time. Because of the mental threat she gave me, I had to hide from her all the time - when she went to work, I opened the window, and as soon as she came back, I quickly closed the window tightly. Anyway, I tried to avoid her as much as possible. Now I had no choice but to close the window again. I sat back at my desk, recalling the two interesting encounters of today, and found them quite interesting, so I wrote them down in one breath.</p>
<p>My watch already reads twelve o'clock, fatigue hits my temples, and I involuntarily fall onto the bed. Tonight, I probably don't need to read a book to fall asleep! (Book from Qingdao)</p>

<h3>Sparks of Red Candles</h3>
<p>— Feng Shike</p>
<p>Branches of delicate red candles burned with countless clusters of raging sparks. They leaned against the front of the crimson tent of the "Writers Association Literary Lecture," trying their best to emit the light of wisdom.</p>
<p>That majestic and beautiful crimson tent! With its vast expanse, it carefully protected the radiance radiating from them; it also blocked the wind hissing that slowly invaded from the gaps in the windows, sweeping past the outdoors - under its feathery cover, it did not allow any slender red candle to be extinguished in the noisy and chaotic terror.</p>
<p>That vast expanse of the crimson tent! It stretched out its huge and powerful arms, enclosing a beautiful and tranquil secluded realm, adapting to the body temperature of each graceful red candle, allowing them to continue burning, burning in warm training; until their towering and smiling flames sang out the peaceful and joyful gospel of the human world together.</p>
<p>The goddess of literature, undulating like ripples and gently stroking like willow branches at the top of the huge crimson tent, looked down from above at all this sweet business, using her harmonious and adorable voice, like rose petals, to make priceless gifts to them -</p>
<p>My delightful red candles! Give a point of heat, emit a point of light, this is your only true understanding of the world. Value your radiant appearance! Before the clear moonlight sprinkles down outside the window, before the sky reflects the intertwined stars!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"I don't like this either...!" Little Tiger said with a naive expression.</p>
<p>"I knew you wouldn't like it." Yaoqun immediately picked up the conversation: "That's why, I must change my appearance before going on stage. If I make a mistake and get caught by the Japanese devils, do you think they would spare me? Wouldn't that be a million times worse?..."</p>
<p>"No, Aunt Ji,... you've changed your appearance several times,... but there's no need to use this poisonous herb!" Little Tiger pointed to the package of herbs placed far away.</p>
<p>"But you need to know, this time we are going to Shanxi, it's not a short-term job of a day or two, is it? Working like this for a long time, those foreign color powders, they don't last long, and you have to put on makeup every day, do you think that would be annoying?… So I thought of this thing; just use it once. Master Qiu said, 'It can last a lifetime!' Wouldn't that save a lot of trouble?"</p>
<p>"A lifetime of using this poison?" This was Little Tiger's central question.</p>
<p>"Poison? What are you afraid of?... What does a lifetime matter? ... Many people, for the sake of fighting the Japanese devils, don't even care about their lives, are we still afraid of poison?" Yaoqun said here, with some choking in her voice, unable to continue.</p>
<p>"Aunt Ji, what will happen after the war is over?" What Little Tiger meant was that the war would eventually end, and Yaoqun's original appearance could not be restored, wouldn't that ruin a woman's whole life?</p>
<p>"What will happen after the war is over?" Yaoqun was probably in the midst of grief and did not hear Little Tiger's words clearly: "After the war...; hum... if we lose, of course, you wouldn't want me to be taken by the Japanese devils as a fallen woman, as a nanny, would you?... If we win, then even if we die, it's worth it, why worry about boils or anything... Besides, I don't believe there's no way to cure it, if I'm willing to cure it..."</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't you be willing to cure it, Aunt Ji?" Little Tiger's childish mind turned the problem around, asking to get to the bottom of it!</p>
<p>Little Tiger's question can be said to have hit the real theme right on the head, and it also touched Yaoqun's second point that she was not prepared to explain:</p>
<p>"Silly child, let's wait until we live to that time before we talk about it, how can we worry about so many things at this time!"</p>
<p>After breakfast, the scene in the wine shop ended here. According to the original plan, they walked towards the "French Concession"; Yaoqun was prepared to find comrades from the stationed detachment to inquire about the situation after the fall of Tianjin.</p>
<p>Along the way, according to Yaoqun's analysis, Tianjin at this time could see three types of people: one is the arrogant and domineering bullies; one is the pitiful common people who are filled with anger in their writings; one is the ignorant and foolish who are wandering astray and at a loss. This, of course, is a general outline-style analysis.</p>

<h3>Basic Education and Scientific Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Liu Wei</p>
<p>The UNESCO Far East Regional Conference on Basic Education Research was inaugurated in our country on September 3rd. The conference lasted for ten days, with participants from fourteen countries. It is the first of the four regional basic education research conferences to be held. Experts have gathered here to discuss the fundamental methods for lasting world peace, seeking to turn swords into ploughshares and dispel suspicion with understanding. This is a grand event! It is expected that the success of this conference will have significant and far-reaching implications for the future basic education cause of countries in the Far East region, especially our country. We can assert this. While wishing the conference success, we should also take this opportunity to offer some personal views for the consideration of the delegates!</p>
<p>Considering the countries in the Far East region, most are ancient civilizations and emerging nations, and science is generally not very developed. In this era of strong competition in the world, with scientific progress advancing rapidly, a country, if it lacks a corresponding scientific foundation, will inevitably be threatened by other countries. From an individual perspective, if one lacks scientific knowledge, one will not be able to adapt to the environment of modern life. Therefore, on the one hand, the country should promote the research of advanced science, and on the other hand, it should instill scientific knowledge in the people. These two aspects should be carried out simultaneously and complement each other. Therefore, the dissemination of scientific knowledge occupies an important position in basic education. However, reviewing the main purpose of the Basic Education Conference, which is primarily to eliminate illiteracy, there are no specific provisions on how to disseminate scientific knowledge to the general public, especially in many Far East countries with backward science. From the standpoint of scientists, we sincerely hope that this conference, in addition to the several themes, can include the popularization of scientific knowledge as one of the important topics for detailed discussion, formulate plans, so that various countries can adopt them, know what to do, and meet the needs of the times. What Eastern countries lack most now is material construction, not spiritual civilization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our country's science started late, and science education is very backward, which urgently needs to be improved. We should take advantage of this international conference to examine the national conditions, learn from others, and thoroughly discuss the plan to improve our country's science education, such as the selection of teaching materials, the flexible use of teaching methods, the compilation of books, the preparation of instruments, the design of experiments, the adoption of audio-visual education, the instillation of scientific knowledge to the general public, etc. All of these should be discussed and considered comprehensively, taking into account the appropriateness of the time and place, and referring to the successful experiences and implementation situations of other countries, to create a practical and feasible plan, so as to improve the fundamental aspects, correct the past biased shortcomings, put science education on the right track, create a model, and set an example. If our country can benefit from the Basic Education Conference before other countries, then this Nanjing conference will not be in vain!</p>
<p>Dr. Julian Huxley, Secretary-General of UNESCO, is a famous scientist who has high expectations for the Nanjing Conference. In his congratulatory message, there is a warning, namely, "How can scientific knowledge be transmitted to non-experts?" It can be said that he understands my heart first. It is hoped that the delegates will follow this intention as a guide for the conference.</p>
<h3>Piercing Through the Clouds and Mist! Television Reconnaissance Aircraft</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>Reconnaissance aircraft using television have gradually shown their potential in modern warfare technology. Currently, some scientists and military experts are working hard to research it, seeking military convenience.</p>
<p>A very high-flying aircraft uses wireless television to transmit the truth of the shelled area to the rear, allowing officers at the artillery position twenty miles away to "see" the results after the shelling. This may seem incredible, but French scientists have been secretly verifying it for two years and have achieved this goal, which has aroused serious attention from the French government.</p>
<p>French government personnel have witnessed a film taken on a reconnaissance plane being replayed on a set of televisions a few miles away - and the interval between taking the film and replaying it was only seven seconds!</p>
<p>There is no specific name for this invention, and it is tentatively called "Invention X." Its detailed content is still kept secret, but it is indeed an amazing invention.</p>
<p>A special aircraft has now been designed that can carry a moving picture camera to take detailed pictures of the ground from an altitude of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. Taking moving pictures from high altitudes has been used in military and commercial applications for many years, and there is nothing surprising about it. However, television reconnaissance aircraft even use infrared cameras to take pictures of the ground through fog or clouds, so they can be used in any weather. Even if the enemy uses smoke screens, they cannot escape its reconnaissance.</p>
<p>This camera is activated by an inspector by hand. It has a large and movable viewfinder that helps him to direct the lens to cover a large area. When the aircraft reaches the ground that needs to be scouted, the photographer orders the film to be activated, and the film automatically passes through the camera.</p>
<p>However, after the film passes through the camera, it is not wound on a spool for development after the aircraft returns to base. Instead, it immediately passes through a developing cabinet, then through a fixing bath, and is washed with a fine water jet. After the washing is completed, the film passes under a television dissector disk, which is connected to a small but powerful transmitter in another compartment on the aircraft.</p>
<p>However, there are many difficulties to overcome in order for this procedure to be put into practical use. The temperature of the air and its effect on film development are still minor problems among all the difficulties. However, the French government and researchers are still fighting hard.</p>
<p>A barrage of shells concentrates on an enemy stronghold a few miles away, and officers can sit at the artillery position outside the firing line and watch their power from the explosion of the shells to the appearance of the destruction work on the screen, which only takes seven seconds. With the report of such a television, it is not difficult to quickly correct the inaccurate shooting of the shells, and any important changes in the target will also be clearly exposed.</p>
<p>The enemy will certainly be jealous of this reconnaissance aircraft and will try to drive it away. However, the television reconnaissance aircraft can also be armed for self-defense, and there must be a squadron of fighter planes to defend it to resist enemy aircraft attacking it in the air.</p>
<h3>Seawater</h3>
<p>Shen Ping</p>
<p>Why is it blue?</p>
<p>The theory that seawater turns blue due to the reflection of the sky's blue color has recently been refuted by Dr. G. K. Jenkins, a professor of physics at the University of California, and Dr. Bowen, the director of the Wilson Mountain Observatory, as false. They found when exploring submarines that countless impurities in seawater reflect the sunlight they receive to the surface of the water, but the reflected light must penetrate several feet to dozens of feet of water before it can reach the surface; therefore, the water absorbs the red and yellow colors in the sunlight, and the remaining green, blue, and violet colors combine to form the true blue of the deep sea.</p>
<h3>Arctic Resources</h3>
<p>— Song Wu</p>
<p>The Arctic region is very rich in resources. The large forests on the continents north and south of 60 degrees north latitude are the most valuable resources in the world, and have not yet been fully utilized. At the same time, there are still large areas of fertile farmland that have not been cultivated, such as the area south of the Great Slave Lake in Canada. The agricultural boundary in Siberia has been pushed to 68 degrees north latitude. For example, near Igarka north of the Arctic Circle, potatoes and vegetables can be grown. Many places in the Arctic are covered with shrubs, grasses, and various plants such as mosses and lichens.</p>
<p>In the Arctic's icy and snowy land, there is very little human activity, but the types and quantities of animals are still very large. Those with special economic value include reindeer, musk oxen, muskrats, white rabbits, lemmings, otters, minks, wolves, dogs, foxes, bears, etc. on land; and seals, walruses, whales, sharks, etc. at sea; and there are also many types of birds in the air. Among them, the meat of deer, bears, and fish can be used for free. Alaska currently has a large-scale deer farming industry; the oil in the bodies of seals and whales is the most convenient source of fuel for heating and burning in the local area; the fur of various animals can be used to keep warm; shark oil is an important raw material for making cod liver oil; Arctic dogs are tall and powerful, and are used to haul sleds and are the most convenient means of transportation in icy and snowy areas.</p>
<p>The Arctic is rich in mineral resources and has great development prospects. Siberia and the North American coast along the Arctic Ocean may become one of the world's largest oil production centers in the future. The Norman oil well in the lower reaches of the Mackenzie River in northwestern Canada has been equipped with a refinery and has laid oil pipelines to the Whitehorse station on the Alaska Highway to supply the needs of cars and airplanes. Coalfields are very wide in the Siberian Arctic Circle and on the Spitzbergen Islands, and the Soviet Union has begun to mine them. The Arctic regions of Siberia, Canada, and Alaska are famous for producing gold. For example, the Yakutsk Republic and the Yukon River Basin are world-famous gold production centers. Uranium is the raw material for making atomic bombs. The world's most important radium ore is in the Eldorado mining area on the shore of the Great Bear Lake in Canada. At present, the area has formed a town called Port Radium, with more than 200 miners. The ore sand is transported to Port Hope on Lake Ontario by river or air. Niagara's hydroelectric power is used to set up a factory to refine plutonium and uranium. The uranium used by the United States to make atomic bombs during World War II was mainly supplied from here.</p>
<h3>Can Energy Become Matter?</h3>
<p>— Shan Shi</p>
<p>Is it possible for electrical energy to be transformed into a physical object and for its energy to continue to exist? What is the force - stronger than electricity and gravity - that can link the nuclei of atoms together? Can electricity be "directly" derived from a group of atoms? Can atoms be used as a source of heat? How can we prevent "nuclear boilers" from exploding? Is it possible for atomic energy to be the driving force of all machines?</p>
<p>Regarding these questions, scientists believe that the application of atomic energy in peacetime must be as great as its contribution in wartime. To achieve this goal, all countries are devoting their full efforts to research. In the United States, the Atomic Energy Research Commission has established two work centers: the Argonne Laboratory near Chicago and the Brookhaven Laboratory on Long Island. They are working hard to find the relationship between the isotopes of radioactive elements and energy and machinery, the structure of the molecules or atoms of metallurgical elements, and use uranium, graphite, and other substances to do experiments, hoping to get the best results, and the effects of atomic energy on the human body and its effects in biology and chemistry are regarded as the focus of research.</p>
<p>According to the latest publication in the American scientific magazine, a machine that can generate one trillion volts has been planned. At the same time, according to Professor Rabi of Columbia University (who won the Nobel Prize), it may be possible to reach three or four trillion volts or more in the future! His explanation is: "This energy The mass of protons or neutrons is possible."</p>
<p>A proton is the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, and it immediately combines with free electrons to form gas. Therefore, for a large number of volts of energy, scientists hope to prove the phenomenon of "the explosion of an atomic bomb, matter can become energy, and energy will definitely become matter!</p>
<h3>Talking About Aerial Surveying</h3>
<p>— Ruan Mengkuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government invited the Air Force Headquarters to conduct an aerial survey and mapping of the entire city of Shanghai. The long-silent aerial surveying has received this news, and I am very happy.</p>
<p>Speaking of aerial surveying, the application of airplanes to take pictures and make maps has already begun in European and American countries. During the First World War, the German army used aerial photography to scout the terrain and gained a lot. Afterwards, various countries adopted it successively, not only for military reconnaissance, but also for land surveying. It has also been around for more than ten years in our country, but it was once stopped during the War of Resistance. Before the war, it was also a sensation, such as the surveying of Zhaopu, Nanchang, the Yellow River flood, and the South China Railway, all of which used aerial photography. Now, scientists around the world are no longer studying the problem of aerial photography, but are studying the problem of aerial mapping, how to make the photos taken into topographic maps that are exactly the same as the real terrain, so that the height curves and the horizontal distance will not have the slightest error.</p>
<p>As for the steps of aerial surveying, it can be divided into control, photography, correction, investigation, mapping, etc. If there are height curves, three-dimensional mapping is also required. If we want to survey the topography of Shanghai, we must first carry out a manual survey to gradually reduce and control the vast area by using triangulation, the so-called large and small triangulation and traverse surveying. This type of surveying is beyond the scope of this article, so I will not go into details. However, modern science has already studied aerial surveying without manual control, and uses radiation triangulation instead. This type of surveying is completely indoor work, and points are selected on aerial photographs to control the area. However, it is used in remote mountains and wilderness areas with sparse population, and the smallest scale measured (such as 1:100,000 or more) is used, but for large scales, its accuracy cannot meet our satisfaction.</p>
<p>The second is aerial photography. Aerial photography is aerial photography, which uses airplanes and cameras to take vertical photographs in the sky. What is different from ordinary photography here is that one is vertical or steep inclined photography, and the other is side photography. The cameras and films are also different. The former camera is fixed, and the focal length is fixed. The latter is movable, and the focal length can be free. The lenses must be similar. The former has one at most, and the latter only has one. That is, the film is either full-color (red light should be sensitive to light) or a fish. Non-full-color film. When we take pictures, there are a total of four to five people on the plane. In addition to the driver, one person directs the route, one person manages the radio, and the other one or two people manage the camera. Most of the cameras are electric, and there are also manual ones. If we want to measure a 1:10,000 photo, we can calculate the flight altitude according to the formula. Assuming that the focal length is 21 cm (there are also 10 cm), the required flight altitude is 2,100 meters. We first ascend to 2,100 meters according to the barometer in the plane. Of course, the height that we ascend is not necessarily very accurate. We only seek its approximation, so the scale of the photos taken varies in size, and we must correct it, which is called correction. When we correct, we use a correction instrument to use the perspective of electric light. Make the control points measured on the ground coincide with the corresponding points on the photo. If they do not coincide, correct the height and the Chinese and Western inclination angles and skew angles of the aircraft. After correction, enlarge it into a 1:5,000 or 1:1,000 blueprint, add a field survey, and ink it to make a map. But this map does not have mountain curves. If you add the measurement of the mountains, there is a three-dimensional mapping instrument, or a multi-magnification mapping instrument, and then use electric light to tell a three-dimensional model, just like the three-dimensional map in the "Complete Map of China" published by Shen Bao, we put on red and green glasses, and we can draw the height curves of the mountains on the mapping instrument according to its three-dimensional model, which is a perfect topographic map.</p>
