<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕三中全會廿四日下午大會中，修正通過經濟審查委會提出之經濟改革方案，全文如次；</p>
<p>（甲）過去之檢討</p>
<p>我國今日之經濟，已面臨嚴重之危機，實無可諱言，細查致此之最大原因，厥為長期戰爭之破壞消耗，使戲前數年辛苦締造之建設事業，摧毀無遺，加以先天貧弱之國家，奮起抗戰，苦撑八年，雖幸獲勝利，確已精疲力竭。我國本為一農業國家，唐宋以來，士大夫習為文章，競趨仕途，至於今日環境，理想雖已變更，而多數智識份子之心理與其技能，仍不能與科學生產之偉大時代相適應，而一切建設，百廢待舉，心或有餘，力實不足。迨抗戰勝利以後，復員為當務之急，元氣已傷，民力未蘇，休養生息，刻不容緩，乃共產黨蓄意造亂，利於國家之分崩，利於社會之動亂，以破壞民生懦手段，以奪取政權為目標，視其一黨之利益高於一切，漢視國家之生存，罔顧人民之疾苦，陰謀焗動，武力爭奪，無所不用其極，使當前復員之工作，倍增困難，一息待紓之生機，因而加重其危殆。</p>
<p>以上所述，或為先天之缺陷，或遭意外之人禍，本黨領導革命，固無刻不在內憂外患中力圖補救其缺陷，克服其困難，然而終屬力有未逮，致政府措施，不僅效果未彰，而缺點時現，茲的為言之：</p>
<p>（一）民生主義為建國之大經大法而其成功，則有待於實業計劃之實施，一切經濟政策，果能依照原則與計劃以解決人民生計為主，自必日起有功，終可辦到人盡其才，地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流，以達到社會化之目的，過去經濟措施，對於民生主義之原則，未能力行，此其一。</p>
<p>（二）生產要素，勞力常先，中國人口眾多，人力是其優點，過去措施，忽視人力之發揮與物資之運用，對於如何計算物資，計算人力，如何引人力參加生產，計劃未周，不能造成生眾食寡之經濟基礎，此其二。</p>
<p>（三）施政主要立信為本，過去在經濟財政金融上之措施，輕決多變，使人民對於政府之信賴為之低減，此其三。</p>
<p>（四）經濟政策重點不明，財政金融制度未立，國營民營畸輕畸重，宜存宜捨，執後孰先，缺乏明確之劃分與堅定之決策，民力外資，觀望隔離，生產建設，致受影響，比其四。</p>
<p>（五）民富則財足，民窮則財盡，故財政問題之解決，當從增加生產，充裕國民經濟着手，方為有效。過去空有平衡預算之懸想，實際預算未能平衡，通貨不免增發，復誤認資金之眞正用於生產者亦為通貨膨脹，致未能以國家之力量扶植生產，而民閒剩餘資力，亦朱能由政府計劃領導走入生產建設之正途，致集中都市，成爲游資，競事投機，妨害售生產，此其五。</p>
<p>（六）金融政策與最大多數人民生活需要相離，允未能與經濟政策密切配合，以扶植農工，獎勵生產，大都以商為主，趨逐近利，成為「不理農業，敷衍工業與惡化商業」之病態，此其六。</p>
<p>（七）拋舊黃金，原為收縮通貨，穩定物價，乃因連用不得其法，反使黃金領導物價上漲，造成市場之在瀾，此其七。</p>
<p>（八）缺乏久遠之籌維與全盤之計劃，舍本逐末，枝節應付，致使內地經濟枯竭，資金集中一隅，造成不均不安之狀熊，此其八。以上所舉，實為坦白之檢討，今後如何解決當前之困難，如何培養未來之基礎，必須對症下藥，確定有效之對策。</p>
<p>（乙）今後之方策</p>
<p>中國有豐富之人力與廣大之土地，以戰勝之國家，作復員之工作，就經濟現狀言，共產黨之破壞搗亂，固為增加困難之重要原因，但其艱窘不應有如今日之甚者，問題所在，仍視政府有無適當之政策以增加生產，培養民力，果能根據民生主義之精神與其社會化之原則處理一切經濟問題，當不難獲得適當之解決。民生主義雖有節制資本之理想，但在現階段中，生產建設，必須先求其有，民股則國富，生眾則財足，故當以國家資本為中心，領導私人資本之活躍，以國營事業任其難，扶助民營事業任其易，關於招致外資，鼓勵民營，如何解除其困難，如何保障其利潤，政府當明確決定輔導，而鼓勵之。政府尤應下大決心，并以事實表現，凡一切有關財政經濟金融之措施應着重於國家遠大之利益，慎之於始，一經決定頒行，即不輕易變更，尤須注意勵行法治，嚴懲貪污賣職，取締操縱態斷，以保障人民權利，庶幾政府信用得以鞏固，則今後經濟政策自不難推行盡利，茲簡述方業之要項如次：</p>
<p>（一）發揮人力，增加生產，一，對於現在之生產事業，蓋量予以保護，以安定在業，助止失業。二，以有效之計劃，使新的生產建設事業逐漸增加，引導游閑坐食之人力，轉而參加生產。三，獎勵科學發明，提倡勞慟服務，以轉移士風，鼓勵創造事業之精神。四，以計劃敎育，配合計劃經濟，使人才之培養與生產之建設打成一片。</p>
<p>（二）增產物資，穩定物價，一，政府頒透過農業生產貸款，或採定購方式，期能促進米麥棉荳等主要　產原料　生產，并運用其一部或大部。二，政府須以原料供給廠商，或透過　業生產貸款，或採定購方式，期能促進麵粉紗布油糖燃料及其他日用必需品之生產，并運用其一部或大部。三，政府頭透過輸出品貸款，或採定購方式，期能促進生絲　砂桐油毛革茶葉豬黎輸出品之生產與輸出，以充實外匯基金。四，政府當以民生日用必需品，對官兵公教人員及生產工廠工人，先作　計劃之供應　配合，此外，有餘之物資，則　都市之需要，作穩定物價之　，使囤積者無法居奇，以達到安定民生之目的。</p>
<p>（三）穩定幣值，一，迅速處理無須國家經營之企業，出售僞產業及剩餘物資，并整理稅收。以謀在短期內彌補財政之不足，防止通貨之膨脹。二，政府應有充分準備，并選擇適當時機，以整理幣制，，期能逐漸恢復常熊。三，東北·合灣·新疆各地之幣制，只須同時整理，使爲一致。</p>
<p>（四）改革金融制度，金融制度之改革，必須特別注意為國家經濟政策服務，以增加農工生產為其主要之目的，金融機構，應各有主要之專門業務，使普遍商業化之現象得以消除，公私銀行并須有計劃的分布全國，使之成為有系統之金融網不致集中於沿海少數都市，尤其是上海一隔，其辦法：一，以縣爲金融制度之　層機構，扶植縣銀行之設立，以便利建設，并配合地方自治之推行。，縣銀行以每縣一行為原則，初辦時，其資本縣佔四成，中央六成，待縣自治工作次第完成時，中央資本逐漸减少，將來選到地方七成，中央三成之比例，中央並應供給專門人才，以予以業務上之輔導。三·銀行視其業務之類別及需要，分別由中國農民銀行，交通銀行或中國銀行爲其後盾。四，土地金融係屬長期性質，必須政府指定專款與發行土地債券，始可濟事，至適當時期，並應另設專行，以司其事。在過渡期間，應充實嚴民鋇行土地金融之資金，透過縣銀行開展業務。五，中國農民銀行經營農田水利農業品之倉儲運轍加工，以及土地貸款，以便利農民，扶助農村繁榮爲其專業之範圍。六，交誼銀行經營工礦交通貸款，發展實業，為其專業之範圍·七，中國銀行經營國內外貿易放款及國際匯兌業務（包括僑匯爲其專業之範圍）。八，郵政儲金匯業局同吸收人民儲蓄存款，辦理小額匯款，并應與合作金庫合作之原則，本利之於農村，用之於農村之原則，以發展農村經濟。九，中央合作金庫經營生產運俞等合作貸款，扶植各種合作社之組織及發展爲其專業之範圍。十，中央信託局專司信託保險，對民衆之信託保險等業務，負輔導之任務。十一，中央銀行爲銀行之銀行，以調劑全國金融，使金融與經濟密切　緊，以完成經濟建設為其主要之職責。十二，四聯總處俟復員完成後，改為設計與聯繫之機構，或與財政部錢幣司合併，改設金融管理局，隷屬於財政部，以一事權。十三，對於省市銀行及普通銀行，政府應為合理有效之指導與管制。十四，各國家銀行應依其性質，實行專業化，對其性質相同之普通銀行業務，負聯繫輔導之任務，其設置分支行之範圍及地點，并應依其業務對象，分別予以規定。（未完）</p>

<h3>行聯總福利會議通過　遣送難民辦法　工賑工作決定四項原則</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總聯總社會福利工作會議，昨上午編審委會譽行會議，檢討各小組會議提案，午後小組會議討論工賬工作及難民僑胞之遣送問題，結果提出議案，均在下午舉行之全體大會中通過。茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>工賑問題</p>
<p>（甲）關於工賑問題：（A）決定原則四項：（一）今後盡量利用工賑方法，救濟失業；（二）以工賬解決工資；（三）賑之目的，不惟使失業者有工作，並為難民解決問題，工資用食糧代替，並非因該地糧食缺乏，乃係切合需要。（B）建議兩點：（一）以後使用工賑方法時，盡量利用應接受工賑之人（指難民而言），（二）工資之付給，以當地之需要給付實物或現金。</p>
<p>遣送難民</p>
<p>（乙）關於難民之遣送問題：難民之現在亞洲者，共分普通難民，泛區難民，欲歸返原居留地之華僑，欲回祖國之華僑，以及歐籍難民等共五種，數目約在五十萬左右。茲分別言之：（一）普通難民分布於全中國各地，尤以華北一帶為最多，將來行總與聯總之工作結束後，因各種政治之原因，國內難民之問題當仍存在，行總不能繼續負責，故提議由社會部與其他有關政府機構合作，作有計劃的發展。由於以上之原因，大會通過議案，請求行總立即與社會部合作，以為他日移交之準備。（二）泛區災民：乃指黃河泛區以及蘇北·安徽·山西一帶之災民而言，尤以黃泛區之難民最成問題，甚至有轉輾流徒達一年以上者，因上述災民之造成有關政治問題，向由行總及政府與中共三方而進行蹉商者，故大會不再多加討論，但建議由有關各方與行總切實合作，解決是項問題。（三）等待歸國之海外華僑，聯總對於此項難民已逐漸遺送，但聯總在本年七月底即須結束，而此項工作又必須完成，故大會通過議案，由行總聯合僑委會，外交部，請求政府重行攷慮參加國際難民機構（蓋我方政府前以該機權經費過鉅，曾決定暫不參加），以便協助聯行總完成工作，若政府未能參加，或該機構在聯總結束時尙未完成，（該國際難民機講，由聯合國組織之，尙未正式成立。）則請聯總繼續担負，或交行總或其他機構完成之。（四）欲返回原居留地之華僑，此項華僑欲返回緬甸者的一萬五千人，欲返菲律濱者的六千人，但均因菲緬二地政府之諸多留難而不克成行，大會通過議決衆，請外交部繼續向上述二地政府交涉聯總亦盡力為之。（五）歐　難民之遣撒，歐籍難民之總數共一萬六千人，聯總已遣撤者四千人，尙有一萬二千人　待遣撤，在聯總結束後，至成問題，大會希望：（A）中國政府加入國際難民機構，俾關助遺撤工作，使之完成，（B）由有經聯總成立委會作縝密討諭。</p>

<h3>與當問題的檢討</h3>
<p>改革金融制度，為三中全會經濟改革方案要點之一。這個問題，其範圍自極廣泛。這裏，擬提出一個比較不經人注意的决要問題卽典當問題來，供大家探討。</p>
<p>典當是老式的平民金融機關，凡是够不上資格和銀行錢莊往來的，向祇有倚賴典當，為緩急融通之具。現在合作社漸决推行，凡是信用合作社，雖同樣擔負存放的任務，但其所貸的對象，照章祇限於社員。其限額，抵品，手續等，又相當嚴格，非習於簡便的一般平民所樂從。因此，在現階段的社會裏，這典當制度，無疑地，還是大衆所需要。各地社政機關，現正在推行公典制度，部頒典押當業規則第二十五條，對於辦理合法各典當，還訂有獎勵的辦法，可證典當地位的重要了。</p>
<p>那末，對於這些典當，究應如何加以改善呢？我們認為第一要點，應是减輕當息，改高利貸為低利貸。拿上海一埠來說，戰前的典當，大致分為兩種：（一）為當，其範圍較大，其利息不過二分，其期限長至十八個月，（二）為質押，其範圍較小，其利息較高，其期限亦較短。通常所稱重利盤剝的高利貸就是指這一種。</p>
<p>抗戰末期，這些高利貸，已高至五角零六釐五，期限縮至一個月。勝利以後，寬放為兩個月。第一個月，月息仍為五角零六釐五，第二個月，爲四角三分六釐五，因爲手續費百八之一五，照例於第一個月內一併先收，而且須加入當本，利上加利的。後經地方主管機關，再三督令减輕，市參議會也有人提案催促，經過好幾個月，方才定案，於本年一月起實行，其期限仍為兩個月，共月息一律减為三角六分，其中包括月息二角五分，綫租四分，手續費七分，此項手續費，不計入當本內。</p>
<p>在工商界拆息，吃到二角左右時，大家已覺得負擔過重，齊聲要求救濟，政府和金融當局也覺得未便坐視，紛紛承受各式低利貸款以資救濟了。而一般平民到如今，遝須支付每月三角六分的高利貸，這當然是一件十分不合理的事情。據聞市府已令知社會局再將當息督令减低。其典押當業管理規則，且規定棧租費祇許月收二釐，保險費亦二釐，其餘一切陋規，槪行禁革，至於所收當息，則責由常地同業公會自行擬訂，呈由主管官署核准，轉報內政經濟兩部備案，　督得相當嚴密。為一般平民的福利着想，我們自然希望其早日實現。</p>
<p>問題是在典當方面，究竟實際上，能將當息减低到何等限度？這是一件事實，不是空言所能解決的。因為典和押的界限，現在早已消滅了。他們的資本通常不過幾百萬元，全市同業七百餘家，其中與行莊有來往的，據說，不過十分之一。其餘的活動資金，不外挪借和吸收存款這兩途，其月息常須出至兩角左右。再加上一切開支，捐稅，利潤等，為勉求維持，避免虧蝕起見，其要求三角六分的當息，自也具有相當的理由。</p>
<p>所以要改善平民金融，減輕他們的負担，其最要關雜，莫急於為他們寬籌資金，並减低其所貼之借息。因為這三角六分的當息，據他們自己計算，是借息二角五分，棧租四分，手續費七分。倘使所貼借息，能够設法减低，那末所收當息，自然可以比例照减了。譬如市立公典，取息祇有二分，當期且長至六個月。不過牠是公益性質，並非營利性質。一方面可以坐貼開銷，一方面，又獲得市銀行的低利透支，所以支持得住。商辦的典當，却是營利性質，當然不便硬敎他們虧本，所以供給低利的融通資金，是减輕當息，和嘉惠平民的唯一有效辦法。</p>
<p>那未，這些低利資金，究應由何方供給呢？市參議會，曾有議決案，促令市銀行担任。市銀行是市有的銀行，對于市民的福利事業，自應當仁不讓，担負起這個的責任來。便是共餘國家行莊，在承受工商業的低利貸款之餘，我們也希望其更分杯羹，讓一般平民略沾餘瀝。全市典當業，現在不過七百餘家。假使有半數申請透支，每家透支額以一千萬元計，其總額也不過卅五億餘元，還抵不上一家大公司的貸放額。何况典當業的透支，是按日逐漸支取的，與一般商廠整批地拿來辦貨的不同。所以在銀行方面的負担，似乎並不嚴重。所成為問題的，是典當業原屬小本經營，拿不出什麼可靠的抵押品來，也不容易找出商業行莊來做祖保，所有滿貨，到了期，又要隨時賣給提莊，不便指充押品的。所有帳簿，又多屬舊式，在審核時，也覺得狠不方便。這在銀行方面，或許要認為太不合式。不過這些條件，到底是技術上的問題，似不難加以尅服。譬如分組連保，共負償還責任，似乎也是一種辦法。</p>
<p>我們所以要提出這一個問題來，其主旨，當然在便利平民，减輕他們的負担。而平民金融一旦鬆動，也會影響到一般利率，使高利貸的氣勢緩和下來。此次三中全會宣言裏，並且有下面這幾句話：「民生主義之目標，為提高大多數人民之生活標準，使全國人民享有均足之生活，故政府一切經濟政策，必須以大多數人民為對象。」所謂大多數人民，當然指一般平民而言，他們現正宛韓呻吟于高利貸之下，姑不談其生活標準，應如何予以提高，其所受重利盤剝之痛苦，無疑地，應設法予以解除的。否則「金融政策，與最大多數人民生活需要相離」，便不是三中全會經濟改革方案之主旨了。</p>

<h3>對德和會應由五强召集　馬歇爾提出建議　全德人民有履行和約議務</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處莫斯科廿六日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾本日向外長會議提出建議，由四强再加中國邀請以前「對德作戰」之全體盟國，在對德和約最後擬成之前，舉行關於德國問題之和平大會。馬歇爾向外長會議提議：一俟籌備工作「充分進步」之時，即召集此等國家參加會議，並使各國均有機會自由發表關於德國問麗之意見。渠並建議，「對於德國之負責代表，亦予以機會在會議中提出其意見」。渠稱，四强將根據會議中三分之二多數表決之建議，草擬對德和約之正文，然後以最後擬定之條約正文，提交以前對德作戰之谷國簽字。</p>
<p>馬氏並建議德國憲決應包括條文一則，「明白規定該憲法中之一切權力，應遵循並按照和約實行之」，果爾「則德人於採行憲法之餘，此項條文常使德國人民有接受和的之義務，凡屬德國人民，均應有履行和的之義務」。</p>
<p>對於馬氏之建議，外長會議未有一般性之協議，貝文及皮杜爾均支持中國為對德和約簽字國之一，莫洛托夫巳同意考慮此項意見。皮杜爾贊同馬氏之憲法條文建議，惟貝文對此舉是否合法則表示懷疑，渠對於從速召開對德和平大會之亦不表贊同。莫洛托夫認為對德和的應由一德國政府簽字，否則該的之力量勢必削弱。莫洛托夫同意對德和會允許德國代表列席提供意見之議，惟皮杜爾則堅決反對。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿六日廣播：美國務卿頃對蘇聯指責英美已因獲得德國賠償百億元而自肥一節，斷然加以否認。馬氏向外長會議提出正式證件，證明美國所已獲得之賠款總數不足二億七千五百萬元。按一星期以前，莫洛托夫曾指責英美反對蘇聯要求一百億元賠款，而自己則所獲得者巳在百億元以上。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿五日電〕關於阿爾巴尼亞應吾參加顧問委員會與情報委員會一項問題，四外長本日會議時，亦曾加以討論，法蘇兩國仍主張阿國應參加此等委員會，英美兩國則仍表示異議，蘇聯代表强調阿國有取得德國賠款之權利，美國代表提議伊期及南美洲各國曾對德宜戰，但非眞正作戰者，亦應參加此等委員會。四國外長對此一問題，並未獲致恊議，旋即接受皮杜爾外長之建議，決定交還四外决會議討論。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬廿五日電〕蘇外决維辛斯基業已通知義大利政府稱，蘇聯政府贊成義代表出席四外長會議，說明對於德和的之意見。據消息靈通人士所知，義外長史福柴接獲蘇外次維辛斯基之照會後，深表滿意，惟對於義國參加外長會議所當採取之方式則尙朱決定。</p>
<h3>對德和約主要條欵　美蘇擬互作讓步　美議减少德境佔領軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿六日電〕頃據可靠消息，美蘇兩國對於德國和的主要條款，今似有意作重大讓步，惟官方對於此種議步，能否具有充分重要性，傳本屆外長會議能就重大爭端成立協議，仍無把握。聞美方所擬讓少者為蘇聯可自德國現行工業生產中，抽取相當賠償至敷年之久，惟須以不加重美國人納稅負擔為先決條件。西方各國外交家相信繼續取得賠償，要為蘇聯主要目的，蘇聯慾望如能於此獲得相當滿足，對其所提其他要求，自必願意加以修改。蘇聯可能的讓步目下尙無特殊跡象可見，惟英外相貝文昨與蘇聯總理中達林會面密談後，對於局勢已表示相當樂觀，此則殊有意義云。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿五日電〕據悉外長會議之美國代表國將提出正式決議案，以訓令柏林盟管會减少四區之佔領軍數額，其意蓋在减少佔領軍對當地物產之消費，使德國得有更多物品可供出口，儘早達到自給自足之地步。美國建議盟管會，決定自一九四七年七月一日起之一年內，為維持四區之安全，需要幾許佔領軍之駐在盟管會至逾應於六月一日向本屆外長會提出調查報吿。馬歇爾此外並將今日之會議提出有關德國民主化，及德國工業之備忘錄各一份，其關於德國工業部份之備忘錄，明白指出投資於任何德國戰爭工業者，決不能盼望有所收穫，僅投資於德國和平工業者，始可獲得報酬。此一備忘錄之提出，意在答覆對美責本主義在德投資之批評。</p>
<h3>美民主觀念定義　在蘇京受精密審查</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科航空通訊）美國務卿馬　爾在四國外長會議中，對於美國民主觀念曾下一定義，使此希臘古字在莫斯科受到精密審查。一部份人主張請蘇聯亦下一定義，認為締造和平之要點，即在能接受定義，假使一個蘇聯公民與一個美國公民，有如外長會議中之爾要角屬歇爾與莫洛托夫，同居一窒，談論民主，則可發見兩人雖操同一方言，而其所談之察或逈不相同。據馬歇爾稱，守法公民之工作權利如被否觀，或有剝奪其生命，自由及幸福　之　則此種社會我人認為並不自由。馬氏並力管競選自由。工會自由。新聞。無綫電。電影。戲劇音樂自由，及市民自由，在美國民主社會之觀念中異常重要。蘇聯報紙接連兩日，就此項定義對馬歇爾作溫和之攻擊，並引設希臘局勢及美國黑人之地位，以示美國實行民主觀念方式之缺點。</p>
<h3>聯合國設美週年紀念　杜魯門電賀賴依　重申美對聯合國機構信心</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿六日廣播：杜奮門總統今日在招待記者會中宣稱，援助希土二國案，可望由國會迅速通過，至於詳細情形，將由美代表奧斯汀在安理會中發表。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕社魯門總統木日送致聯合國秘書長賴依一節賀文，祝賀聯合國駐美週年紀念，並重申美國人民對聯合國前途之信心。總統之賀文如次：「欣逢聯合國駐美週年紀念，余謹代表美國政府與人民向閣下敬致賀忱。美國人民感謝聯合國之地點設立美國，對聯合國前途備具信心。顧一年來聯合國對建立和平世界之艱難工作，已有良好之開端。美國願竭盡微力增强聯合國之力量，並促成聯合國憲章之原則與目的·一年來閣下為和平服務，充任聯合國與第五十五會員國公正不阿之公僕，對此項高貴之任務，堅毅不撥，全力以赴，此余所願在此向閣下致私人之謝忱者也。」</p>
<p>美將向安理會說明希土現狀</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕美駐聯合國代表奧斯汀本日聲稱：渠願於星期五安理會上，對希臘與土耳其現况有所說明。按上項聲明係渠與社魯門總統會議後發表。渠已逗留華盛頓數日，擬於星期三晚回紐約。奧斯汀稱：渠將請求聯合國秘書長賴依將希臘問題置諸星期五明安全理事會會議議程上。至所擬說明者為何，奧斯汀僅稱，「希臘北境之紛擾，牽涉安全理事會所管轄事務，吾人將就此加以論列。」之後，渠又續稱：該項說明亦將包括土耳其在內。</p>
<p>美駐希臘大使向外委會報告</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕美駐希臘大使麥克維今日向衆院外交委員會之秘密會議，報吿希臘局勢，開會計達二小時半之久。事後外委會主席伊頓稱：外委會於聆取麥克維之報吿後，益覺有通過立法以援助希土兩國之必要云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿五日電〕美國佛羅里達州民主黨參議員裴柏，本日在參議院發表冗長演辭，猛烈抨擊杜魯門總統之中束政策，稱之為「帝國主義之政策」並要求將巴爾幹問題及土耳其間題提交聯合國機構處理。</p>
<p>渠並提　美國應撥款二萬五干萬美元，嚴格用睹在經濟上援助希臘，此種基金應由聯合國機構管理，其他各國亦得捐贈云。</p>
<h3>希薩朗尼加港　改闢自由港</h3>
<p>保對美建議殊感典</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社保加利亞京城廿五日電〕關於美國擬提議主張將希臘薩朗尼加港改為國際自由港一事，此項消息傅至此間，保國人民聞之均極興奮。官方人士咸謂：列强曾准許保國在第一次世界大戰結束之後，即可在愛琴海獲得一出口，但此項諾言，從未兌現云。</p>
<h3>希外長否認　以空軍基地讓美</h3>
<p>〔合衆社雅典廿六日電〕希臘外長蔡爾達理斯今日絕對否認法國新聞社所傳消息，謂希臘政府業已接受美國請求，允許將空軍基地讓與美國。</p>
<h3>對奧和約討論　已獲重大進展</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿五日電〕四國外决會議今日討論奧地利問題所獲進展較歷次會議為多，刻已組成起草委員會，將和的擬定形式，俾便在星期六提交四强討論，幷同意先於明日討論經濟方面之困難條款，蘇聯亦己應允對奧地利之流亡人羣，提出其建議。據蘇聯古賽夫稱，蘇聯對此問題之建議計分二部，其一關於撤退奧境內之日耳曼人問題，第二為實行和的後之六個月內完全撤退其流亡人羣。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿五日電〕四國外次會議本日開會，討論對奧和的問題，當即決定設一四强專家委員會，每國一人，對於對奧和的軍事條款，起草報吿書，提交四外長會議討論，此外四外次對於經濟問題之報告，業已起草完成。</p>
<h3>安理會表决英阿爭議　蘇聯行使否决權</h3>
<p>英擬將該案提交國際法庭</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿五日電〕聯合國安全理事會今日以多數票表決支持英國控訴阿爾巴尼亞數設水雷案時，蘇聯突然　用否決權。此為該會自去年九月廿日蘇聯取消美方最初建議實地蘭查巴爾幹局勢以來之第一次行使否決權。英國提出之修正決議案要求承認平時　殺水雷而不通知各國係屬「連反人道」之舉，且阿爾巴尼亞對該水曾事先曾經獲悉。表決時，除　利亞棄權，及英國以原吿關係不得投票外，本以七票對二票通過該案，投反對票者為蘇聯與波蘭二國。但蘇聯旣經運用否決權，阿爾巴尼亞事件殆將被擱置於安理會。據英方人士稱，英國現擬提議將該案移交國際法庭處理。</p>
<h3>希臘慶祝獨立節游擊隊發生內訌</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典廿五日電〕希臘全國人民本日慶祝一百二十六週年獨立節時，里多爾基區之游擊隊突發生內訌。緣有一部份游擊隊欲向政府軍投降，遂與另一部份發生衝突，結果二十人殞命。雅典城內本日慶祝獨立節，大砲二十一尊，同鳴放禮砲，全城國旗到處飄揚，軍樂隊列隊行紹各通街大街，國王喬治二世，檢閱軍隊，大主敎即前攝政達馬斯基諾斯親王發表演說，籲請全國人民團結五致，保障國家利益與信念。</p>
<h3>託管理事會正式揭幕　美蘇醖釀新異見　賴伊發表重要政治演說</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿六日電〕在聯合國託管委員會開幕時，聯合國秘書長賴依致辭，措詞極為鄭重，除暗射美國援助希土計劃妨碍聯合國之地位外，並稱：聯合國「不久」將討論巴勒斯坦問題。渠透露安理會量期五集會時美國將解釋其援助希土之反共政策，而蘇聯或亦將趁機第一次正式批評美國之動機。賴依簡述託管委員會之組織後稱：「新幾內亞·烏侖迪·吐谷蘭·法屬喀麥隆·坦干尼格·西薩薩摩亞。英屬吐谷蘭與喀麥隆等地，現均置於託管制度之下。若干國聯委治之土地如諾魯·西南非·巴勒斯坦·與太平洋前日本委治島嶼，尙未置於託管制度之下」云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國今日又將準備應付美蘇間之新異見，並可能發生蘇聯對美國援助希土計劃作第一次之正式批評。蘇聯之引人注意，自有其多種理由，籃由於美國已對下列數項主要事態發展，早在準備之中。第一，美國準備對安全理事會解釋為何以四億天金供援助希土兩國，祚為防共之用，而未通知聯合國。第二，聯合國秘書長賴伊成立託管理事會時，準備致開幕辭，非難美國對聯合國之妨碍行動。第三，蘇聯直至最後一刻，依然使聯合國其他會員風仍捉摸不定，該國是否參加世界組織主要機構之一之託管理事會。賴伊聽從其助手中若干人之諍吿，擬在託管委員會開會時，以溫和之辭句演說，惟事前將大事宜傳其開幕辭為「重要之政治演說」。據接近聯合國方面人士之消息，賴伊以美國希土政策為致辭題材之原來計劃，已以旁敲側擊之言辭代替。但聯合國秘書長賴伊，開現並未完全放棄其旣定主張，即强調聯合國除非其所有會員國將一切國際問題交其解決，即無成功之望。蘇聯為託管理事會十國中唯一未預先指定其代表之國　，　　　　開其　聯合潤　世界約近二償五千九百萬未獨立人民，予以新　濺之計劍，有參加之決意。蘇聯之拒絕參加，自足予聯合國懷有奢望之託管計劃嚴　打華云·</p>
<h3>原子能委會開會無結果</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國原子能委員會廿五日舉行秘密會議，草擬管制原子能之詳細計劃，但於論及如何着手進行時，立即引起爭執。美國認為各國屆　受內波方面之若干干涉，並要求該委員會開始草擬協定，以規定臘際管制機構之權力。蘇聯代表萬羅米柯提出反對，堅持主張應先討論渠對「巴魯　計劃」所提出之十三點修正案。葛羅米柯之修正案主張限制國　管制機構之權力，及保留五疆對於　罰違饑家一事之否決權。叙利亞贊成蘇聯之立塲，澳州則支持美國之見解。經三小時面紅耳赤之激辯後，原十能委員會即吿休會，定本月卅日重行會議。　〔法國新聞社成功湖廿五日電〕聯合國安全理事會定於本月廿八日開會，將討論日本前在太平洋所代管之島嶼，交美國單獨託管一項問題。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕此問常局研究官方及非官方紀錄結果，籍悉蘇聯目下軍用飛機數量實較天國為多。美蘇二國空軍比較如下：蘇聯各式飛機的一萬六千架，內大多數係驅遂機。美國用於作戰之飛機的一萬三千架，內五千餘架屬於陸軍航空隊，的三千架係海軍或海軍陸職隊機，母艦載運或陸上基地者均有。蘇聯海軍實力殆尙薄弱，其海軍航空隊僅占不重要地位。以上數字並不包括預備役空軍在內，美國所有預備役飛機準備程度雖多參差，數目則與正規機隊相若。蘇聯預備役空軍數量未悉。至於飛機生產方面，因蘇聯現行生產能力與目標缺乏情報，無從比較。但據空軍戰略家表示，蘇聯除潛水艇外已放棄建設强大海軍之計劃，故可轉移造艦物資與人力，用於飛機生產，此一因素殊為重要，應予注意云。</p>

<h3>海閩輪受創修復後抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在厦門附近海面與海軍砲艦伏波號互拉撞致使砲艦沉沒之海閩輪，已於昨日下午五時抵滬，停泊董家渡三泰碼頭附近江心，該輸僅船首水艙撞破，已在廈修復。本市海軍第一基地司令部代表，招商局代表，交通部代表及航海專家等十餘人，於該輪停泊後，即行上船，召第船長及乘客代表等調查關於此次慘案發生之經過。記者亦於斯時登輪分訪船長戴儒林，乘客鄭桂仁，及伏波艦上唯一獲救生還之輸機長焦德孝上尉</p>
<p>焦上尉體格强壯，但精神尙現疲憊，渠當時在水面飄浮達四小時之久，始得獲救。據談出事經過情形如下：十八日與十九日間之午夜，渠於睡夢中聞轟隆一聲，初尙以為係觸礁，急忙取起救生帶開出房門，跑至甲板上，看到艦尾已在開始下沈。</p>
<p>全部官兵慘遭滅頂</p>
<p>是時全艦官兵均已紛集甲板，船長一面打信號向海閩號求救，一面開始放下救生小舳舨，艦身則繼續下沉，艦尾於一分鐘後已全部沉沒，至船首部份下沉更速，瞬息間海水已將近頂。渠擬自駕駛台下走出，躍入海中，但水已沒頂矣。幸熟請水性，掙扎一分鐘後，得以飄浮水面，然已飲水兩口。是時風浪甚大，海面飄浮之其他官兵甚多，紛紛呼救，如是約經半小時後，海閩輸上有探照燈射來，但距離甚遠，未能即來營救，僅見其緩緩行駛，亦不知是否圖謀靠擺施救，所能確定者，此後該輪即未遠離。經過的又半小時後，有一浮筒飄至渠身邊，此一浮筒實為渠之救命恩人，斯時海面飄浮之其他官丘因時間過久，體力不支，已先後沉沒溺斃矣。最後渠扶持之浮筒為海閩輪所發現，遂倖得而為此次慘案中之唯一生還者。伏波號上共載官兵一百六十餘人，其中有見習生二十人，均係新近考取之二十歲上下之高中畢業生，學業未成，而身已先殉，誠屬不幸。</p>
<p>船上乘客均表不滿</p>
<p>記者旋晤乘客鄭桂仁，係交通部上海材料處職員，渠力詆海閩輪船長之失責，據稱在出事前發現伏波艦檔路，雖在午夜極為淸楚，但船長不肯煞停，及至碰撞後，鄭至船頭觀看，但見軍襤被撞翹起，高入半空，逐漸下沉，但海閩輸當時並不立即停駛行救，反繼續前進逃走，船上客人有問為何不救者，則答以別管閒事。直至淸晨二時，始行折回至出事地點，尙見兩三人飄浮水面呼救，但船長尙不肯立即營救，致躭誤時機，僅救起焦德孝一人。渠最後並稱：所有船上乘客對船長均極不滿。即海閩輪此次駛滬時，原本於前日即可抵達，但駛至離滬一百二十度處，竟又駛錯航綫，致延至昨日傍晚始能抵達。</p>
<p>船長一紙書面報告</p>
<p>船長戴需林，精神萎靡，見記者時囁嚅而言，僅將其呈與招商局之書面報吿出示，內稱：「海閡輪於十八日下午三時，正由廈門開往上海，於十九日晨零時七分依眞針路五十八度正橫經過燈塔Ocksen　Light　Honse時，見一輪之一桅燈及綠舷燈在木輪左舷的四十度處。當時本輸以該輸顯示緣燈，從西北向東南而行，依照海上避碰章程，本輪無避開航路之責任，故乃守原針路航行，至零時十二分，見該輸未曾避讓航路，且愈行逼近，故本輪遂即鳴汽笛一聲，並用極右舷，同時開怏倒車，因該輪仍橫衝而來，遂致於零時十五分該輪全部被撞於本輪頭部，該輸受傷慘重，不數分鐘即吿沉沒，本輪當即停留巡行該地，多方竭力營救，工作至四時廿分，救起該輸輸機爲焦德孝一人，本輸仍繼續搜索，直至十九日十二時正，因覺出事地點四面週國並無發現任何在水面漂流之八及物件，而本輸船尖水艙破裂，　水達十七呎餘，故為本輸安全計，乃決意開近厦門，以為臨時修補。據救起之該輸輪機長焦德孝云：該輸即為中國海軍軍　伏波號，由福州開往台淺云」</p>

<h3>蔣夫人　昨抵滬</h3>

<h3>燃管會主委談配煤程序　工廠與民生用煤　均曾由會會審查　對報載各案稱不擬置辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燃管會主委徐樂天，昨日接見本報記者，對該會配煤情形，有所說明。渠稱：本會配煤優先程序有五：（一）鐵路。（二）公用事業，程序為：（甲）京滬兩地，（乙）京滬滬杭沿綫，（丙）漢口，青島，廣州，廈門，福州，寗波。（三）船舶，程序爲：（甲）軍公，（乙）商輪。（四）工廠。（甲）國營，（乙）民營。（五）民生用煤交由煤業公會配售。本會對前三項之主要配煤，在任何情狀之下，從未中斷。惟近兩月來，天災人禍，秦皇鳥冰凍逾工一月有半，台灣發生暴動事件，靑島原有淄川博由兩礦，又吿淪陷，故二三月來之配煤，咸恃該會存底供給。渠聲明：燃管會成立之主因，即因煤斤短絀，調配不勻而來。近二月來因到煤少，而對優先程序中前三項之配煤，又萬不能减少，砍對四五兩項之配煤，不得不吿减少。</p>
<p>公會負責·運送調查</p>
<p>關於配煤辨法，除前三項主要配煤，係本會直接配售外，其他配煤原則，本會職員，一向不得與谷廠發生直接關係。配煤辦辦係先由各需煤工業同業公會，彙集各廠之串購數量，先經各公會審核認可，再送燃管會。燃管會即按逐月到煤情形，依成數核定准配數量。核定後一面將數量及價目通知各公會，一面亦同樣通知煤業公會，請煤業公會負責輸送，並調查報吿兩點·（一）該廠是否用煤，（二）該廠是否開工。如有未合，燃管會一經煤業公會通知，即行停配。此次報載各案，均尙未定案，且各案均有往返公文可稽，本會不擬置辯。惟本會辦理配煤手續，無不隨時力求改進·　　外　　木　　　　之辦法，有所指正。同時仍望煤業公會，對配煤之稽查責任，仍繼續協助。</p>
<p>下月到煤·可望增多</p>
<p>渠又稱：本會一月份到煤十一萬噸，二月份到煤七萬噸，本月份到煤十二萬噸。然單就配煤優先程序中前一一一項之配煤言，每月已需十八萬噸。現四月份之到煤情形，或可望好轉，緣東北葫盧島已開凍，每月估計可到二三萬噸。台灣秩序亦吿恢復，可望輸出小量煤斤。故希望在下月內，對民營工廠及民生用煤，能留出一部份煤斤，以供配售，配法仍求改進。</p>
<h3>央行同人購金細帳　全體有四十六名　最多者購三百兩</h3>
<p>關於此次黃金風潮案內中央銀行購買黃金一節，據悉，在金潮案發生以後，上海方面，即經經濟檢查團將中央銀行配售之五家金號帳册吊去。其中在泰康潤金號帳內發現以王麗戶名，代中央銀行同人購金，前後凡十次，總數計九十七條。當經該行稽核處據以報吿，一面幷傳詢泰康潤金號經理。經查明王麗乃泰康潤職員，平時係派赴中央銀行辦理黃金取貨付款者。央行同人，間有委託其代買情事，該號帳上，因係王麗經手，故以日麗名義列戶。其間多由央行業務局出納科副主任王元淸，劉懋棣二人介紹。此後又發現同豐餘帳內，有央行業務局　理王松濤購金二條。其他同人購金數量，經分別由泰康潤金號及經手人開列淸單，但多數係一二兩及三五兩之零星數目。其中最大一筆，為業務局辦事員黃達夫代其親友購進三十條。經分別查對屬實。按黃金自由買責之後，央行同人購金原與一般人民無異，並不遠法。惟以該行過去曾有通令，行員在辦公時問以內，不得代人經手款項，故對於王松濤·王元淸·到懋棣。黃達夫等四人，認為有違行紀，已一律予以開除。其他各員，以為數極微，且係儲蓄性質，經分別予以警告或記過處分。外界人士，對於張總裁整飭行紀之決心，咸表欽敬，惟設行多數同人，以王松灣。王元淸等在行服務多年，素稱勤愼，此次代人購金，竟受嚴厲處分，深示同情及惋惜之意云。</p>

<h3>政府發行美金債券　滬金融界反響良好</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中常會於昨晨例會上通過發行卅六年度短期庫券及美金公債共計四億美元，此項消息傳滬以後，工商銀錢界均極興奮，反響極為良好，記者為明瞭各方對政府此一新措施之意見，特走飭此間金融界人士，茲將各方意見分誌如次：</p>
<p>據市商會理事長徐寄康氏聲稱，對政府發行美金償券，事前並無所開。迨本人下午至商會時，方始獲悉。本人看法，認為此際發行，實為良好機會，對收回法幣及歸納黃金外匯於正當途徑，更為無上良策。在數字總額方面，試以游責比例，幷不龐大。在推行程序方面，前途亦可望順利，因目前物價平穩，囤積减少，銀錢兩業頭寸充斥，自有餘力可以承購。至推行方面，徐氏主張着重於廣泛，以資普遍，不必僅限於銀錢兩藥，則將來收效更可廣大。關於以後銀根緊凑，是否影響物價一點，徐氏認為幷不可能云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日國防會通過發行償券四億美元，記者特以此事，叩詢某觀察家意見。渠稱：政府自頒行經濟新方案後，金鈔交易停頓，市塲游資日見泛濫，而物價亦殊呈平穩。可見游資正在徬徨，搜覓出路。此項龐大游資，如不設法吸收，最後恐仍將在物價上掀風作浪。現政府發行鉅額美金債券，實係吸收游資之良好辦法。如該項債券能推行盡利，預測未來物價趨勢，更將下跌云。</p>
<h3>統債午後激漲</h3>
<p>公債昨午前較形疲軟，業中某大戶掃數出龍。惟四二〇室一等有背景實力派仍在傾進而多盤。統丙晨開一六五〇〇元，高價迫二〇〇〇〇元關，而後回降至一六四〇〇元低價收市。結果較前收計甲乙跌一千三，丙降二千元，丁戊各跌一千六，成交的二千餘萬元。午後開有籌發美金公債之訊，買風因國防會議通過而激起。漲達二一二〇〇元，最後稍盤。</p>
<h3>外股　游資活躍　漲勢益烈</h3>
<p>外股昨以各方游資湧入，悄形更為熱烈，怡紗自二一五〇〇元起，午後漲達二五〇〇〇元，而後稍有獲利了結而略回。活動者過於擁擠，十一時後，一度停止賣買。英聯怡啤上市及在港開拍說濃。橡皮股聞決在港開拍，有買少賣，結果較前收計怡紗怡　漲二成光景，會德豐業廣各升一成强，餘者各漲成半。</p>
<h3>給予出口補貼</h3>
<p>僅以去年十一月七日至十六日出口貨為限</p>
<p>中央銀行對去年十一月七日至十六日之出口貨物，在本年二月七日至十六日實施出口補貼期間時，將外匯結售與中央銀行者，迄至目前為止，仍可得到補貼，但出口商必須將全部出口文件提出，否則難於核准。</p>

<p>黃豆去化復暢，油廠汕頭帮納胃甚食，猛漲三五千元。菉豆南洋銷路尙有，但吃價甚緊，見疲三五千元。苞米平正，紅糧挺立，蠶豆盤旋。生仁洋莊接連收購，飛黃騰達，步砌三五千元。芝蔴牢立。</p>
<p>油市仍未正式成交，塲外一致回降五六千元，午後市府邀集油商業民營國營油廠，開會討論食油問題。</p>
<h3>人造絲平定</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲市開始仍疲，終與上日軋平。一二〇號高山有光，上午量小喊五百九十五萬元開盤，終因出價過低而乏入供應，下午仍喊上日原盤六百〇五萬元賣出。一二〇號斯尼亞有光，上午做開價五百七十五萬元，廠絲昨稍活動，B字等級七百三十五萬元有成交。下午C字等級二十九萬元做開，普通貨另担橫條坯，喊價六百五十萬元。干經有單子貨五百八十萬元，綢貨市况平庸。大誠格十璧縐喊一萬六千二百元，成交極希。被面雖有喊價而乏交易，其餘各貨，俱無變動。</p>

<h3>銀樓小同行復業　飾金暫售五十八萬　尙示經社會局核准</h3>
<p>自政府公佈銀樓飾金辦法以後，本市大部份小同行銀樓，均已於昨日開始營業，售出價格為五十八萬元，較法定價格高出百分之二十强，惟此價係各銀樓自行決定，尙未呈奉市政當局核准，故十八家大同行為審愼計，仍未復業。據銀樓業同業公會負責人稱，昨擬定合法利潤及營業開支表一份，將呈請社局裁定，該項表册內規定銀樓業合法利潤為一成，（四萬八千元）其餘捐稅包紮，利息耗費等合計為五萬二千元，總計每兩應予利潤十萬元，如社局能允准掛牌五十八萬元，則大同行日內即可復業。又據社會局經濟行政處負責人稱：將於日內會同中央銀行市參議會等機關，共同商討，以作具體決定云。</p>
<h3>糖價趨勢堅穩</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢堅定，上落無多。公會劃盤，現貨二二中砂白為二十三萬元，秘魯細砂初為二十一萬一千元，中途略有盤旋，為零九千元，八千五百元，九千元，後仍為二十一萬一千元至二十一萬元。二四粗白小三四千元，棧單亦小二千元。三半車白小二三千元，台赤現貨十五萬五千元，小千元。棧單十五萬二千元不動。土糖續緊，汕帮開出提靑十三萬九千元至七干元，順德靑十三萬三千元，半南靑十三萬元。興化白高貨二十萬〇三千元，决之十九萬八千元。興赤十三萬四五千元至十四萬元。建帮開刁靑十二萬七八千元，共成交七八百件</p>
<h3>多方咸有了結　華股市況疲落</h3>
<p>華股昨在掉期前夕，存帳雖增為一千六百萬，現品提交亦增至一千三百八十餘萬，多方咸有了結，終吿不支而疲。美金公債消息傳出，午後賡續跌落。晨開平穩，開後遞永紗微漲，一五二號二二三號二一五號二〇五號賣至二四九〇元。嗣有趁低來進，回升至二五九〇元。此時美亞中絲漲停，八九號二一八號一〇四號脫手，永紗更退至二五四〇元。其後互有進退，臨收時忽形不支，降至二四五〇元左右，收後微升。結果較前收計永紗景福新華微降，中法微升，美亞漲半成，信和勤興降半成，新光獨跌一成。遞交永紗信和新光景福微降，華豐降半成，美亞微升，冷股中絲漲停，商務水泥平平，火柴微升，餘微降及跌半成不等。</p>
<p>午後有發行美金公債之訊，人心一度騷動，先高後低，一八〇號三五號會進現永紗升至二四八〇元。旋因脫手者多，回降至二四〇〇元。榮豐由一九八號，中絲由九九號，掛高至漲停，永紗則跌至二三五〇元。信和亦由二二四號二二三號等了結而降，此後永紗曾盤跌至二三二〇元左右。一二號一四二號二一九號趁低維持，美亞由八四號四號一八〇號等吸納而回高，臨收時會吿盤升至二三八〇元而後徘徊。結果較前收計中法平平，永紗華豐景福勤興新華各降半成光景，新光跌一成强，遞交永紗信和新光景福均吿降微，美亞華豐降半成弱，冷股榮豐中絲漲停，火柴商務平平，中紡內衣跌一成，餘跌半成左右。塲外各股，閘北水電稍升，餘者平平。</p>
<h3>外銷茶去路細</h3>
<p>呆頓多時之各色內銷茶，昨日市上，依然缺乏　　之　。綠本　及客帮，但无相當去化，致　户大　裏足不前也。洋　茶市。　貨　為謀週闢起見，仍圖脫手，是以市上一片賣聲，有若雨後春筍，怒茁不　，而進購者雖趁低有吸，惟對售價前途，始終看跌，全日交易　　，形勢亦弱，脚地猶岌岌可危。</p>
<h3>山東羊毛銷旺</h3>

<h3>猪鬃市塲清閒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕猪鬃以外價頻挫，市價　（成本，朱能再予抑低，故交易　甚少。漢口猪鬃產地每箱仍屹立於五百廿萬元之高峯，滬市喊價五百廿萬元，實際並無成交。重慶八十七號黑　，　價　箱二百軍十八萬元（一〇〇市斤，）滬市　司馬擔（一三三磅）喊價三百八十萬元，亦無吸胃。漂白　，牙刷廠亦無吸胃。</p>
<h3>桐油報價未跌　滬市脚地頗軟</h3>

<h3>吳市長召油商會談　澈底消滅食油黑市</h3>
<p>吳市長鑒於目前本市一般物價均漸趨穩定，唯食油黑市尙猖獗，非僅影響民生，且足刺激其他物價之波動，頗為震怒。昨目下午四時特在市府召集油商業公會理事長張超，中植油廠負責人邱良蔭，王仰先，民營油廠代表謝裕沂等會商，除繼續供應零售商門售需要之配油，並嚴查非法油商居奇抬價，決澈底消滅黑市。</p>
<p>中植油廠昨配售零售商乙組第二〇一——四〇〇號，中食公司生袖每補三六〇市斤，每市祖價法幣廿五萬元，外加送力九千五百元，共計九〇九·五〇〇元。昨廿六日備妥支票至九江路一五〇號該公司付款，今日送貨。</p>
<h3>委託銷售貨物所滙　六十日內必須結售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行於廿五日以第九十一號通函，分發各指定銀行，略稱：對於本年二月十七日以前，業已運美而迄未出售之委託銷售貨物，而其外匯仍未結售者，茲規定該項外匯，得按現行匯率，結售予各指定銀行，惟以下列二條件為限：（一）自本月廿五日起，六十日內，該項委託銷售貨物，必須出售，其外匯必須結售予指定銀行。（二）委託銷售商如不能在上述時限內出售該項貨物，則必須授權指定銀行，轉囑其認可之代理人，代為善價出售。為履行該項條款計，自本月廿五日起，委託銷售商須於三日內，向指定銀行提供書面保證，證明據給指定銀行該項權限。中央銀行對上述時限，不擬再考慮展延。將來如因國外市塲價格低落，致所能結售之外匯頭寸，發生變動時，則將按各別情形，而由央行事先考慮准許與否。出口商如不遵照上述辦法辦理，則央行將着各出口商按八十六號通函所定之外匯率，結售其外匯。　又據央行業務局副局長邵貞華語記者，該項委託銷售貨物，抵美已久，央行亦早有規定，該項銷售貨物，須於九十日內出售，惟各商迄未照辦。且按規定，其外匯須按三三五〇元之匯率，結售予指定銀行。而此次央行又復寬容照現行匯率結售。而該項貨物之出售，亦循各出口商之請，另行展延六十日。故央行實已予各出口商以一切可能之方便云</p>
<h3>英鎊滙率決不變更</h3>
<p>自中央銀行，將英鎊匯率掛牌規定眞進為四萬元，賣出四萬八千元以後，出口商僉認為銷英物資，吃虧甚大，希望中央銀行予以調整。據聯合徵信所記者，向中央銀行方面探悉，英鎊匯率之規定，極為合理，目前不致有所變更。因英務匯率之牌價，係根據美元與英鎊之比値而定，當時美匯已定為國幣一二·〇〇〇元，以法幣折合英鎊之實値，最高為四萬元。在美匯無變動前，英鎊不致單獨變動，至出口商買進為四萬八千元，即屬出口商之成本價値，再加合法利潤，不致有吃虧之虞。</p>
<h3>輸管會核定　橡膠進口限額　額外又批准九百噸　作為目前臨時補給</h3>
<p>自國際橡膠統制委員會撤消後，新嘉坡·爪哇·馬來亞·西貢等地之橡膠產品均被美。英·法·各國爭購，裝運回國。我國之橡膠業原料，因所在地氣候關係，本身僅海南島。瓊州一帶略有出產外，大部份均賴國外運來，按照實際之需要量，上海方面七十二家廠，每月需橡膠一千八百噸。此外廣州。台灣。靑島。重慶。瀋陽。安東各地所有各廠，每月共需二千噸。全國各地共計需要三千八百噸。自輸入品管理委員會成立後，對橡膠之進口限制頗嚴，故本年度亳無新定貨輸入，僅靠去年度之存貨製用。嗣經該業要求，上月份由輸管會核准准予臨時進口匹百噸，據該業負責人談稱，此四百噸已向國外定妥，半個月內可運牴滬上。本月份又核准五百噸，由該業公會按照各廠之機器數量審核分配，日內即可分配完畢。本月底由輸管會將許可證發下，即可向國外訂購，該業現亟盼核准之橡膠能早日輸入，以維生產云。</p>
<p>又本年度第一季二·三·四三月中橡膠之進口限翱經政府核准為一百十萬元美金，由橡膠業及製品業共同分配，昨該工業會商結果，決定橡膠業得七十五萬美金，製品業得三十五萬美金，目前美國橡膠之價格，每噸售五百美金云。</p>
<h3>五廠聯合配粉　期限延長二月</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市福新，阜豐，華豐，茂新等五大麵粉廠負責人榮毅成，席德柄等及中信局易貨處俞副理，於昨日上午十一時，赴市府晋謁吳市長。洽談經過，略以按原有規定，五大粉廠聯合配粉，本維持至本月底為止。現決再展延二月，至五月底止。配售數量及價格，決不變動。各廠如有虧蝕，則決由政府暫予補貼云。</p>
<h3>白煤繼續挺秀</h3>
<p>白煤塊市勢繼續挺秀，尤以高檔貨焦作塊，及鴻基埤最為俏俐，白煤屑供貨除利華屑略有運到外，高檔貨鴻基屑等亦缺貨，然因煤球滯銷，故交易極呆，市氣難以振作。烟煤交易已略見推動，唯成交價反較前略低。</p>
<h3>中央銀行昨開　常務理事會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行總裁張嘉璈，於昨日下午三時，在該行召開央行常務理事會議。由張總裁兼主席。出席常務理事孔祥熙，陳其采，陳光甫，陳行等。尙有常務理事宋子文，徐堪二人，因事缺席。討論迄六時許散會。席間報吿案件共十一起，討論提案計包括央行人事，分行之設立及裁撤，及貸款案件申請備案等共六十七起。</p>

<h3>為了春裝　春裝特刊　上海小姐動腦筋　一九四七年摩登式樣應運而生</h3>
<p>春光明媚的季節到了，小姐們脫下臃腫的冬衣，正計劃着新製最時髦，最新式的春大衣，穿到身上要顯得富麗堂皇，雍容華貴，給人一種適意的感覺。</p>
<p>我們在最近幾天，花了不少的工夫，訪問了不少服裝專家徵詢小姐們今年春大衣的式樣，他們或她們都是根據蒲上個月從紐約或巴黎來的女十服裝新式樣，來作精密的設計，這種新式樣的春大衣，現在巳經出規了。</p>
<p>今年春大衣的式樣，和去年比較，最大的不同處，在袖子方面，其式樣為多年不見的球形袖，傘形袖，及重瓣袖，脅部改為寬大舒適的方形袖範，臂部成圓筒形，腕部緊窄，這幾點最引人注意。至於前身並無多大變動，後背很寬大，有三個或四個波浪，風吹欲動，飄然若仙。領圈仍不站重要地位，大衣的全長約為四十寸，形成Spor　Fashion，而三十六寸的三瓜脫大衣（見圖），也極為適體。其他裝飾方面，如鈕扣，腰帶等，都要整齊大方。色澤方面，以淺色為主，如淡黃，米黃，淺灰，銀白等，而襯以深色之內衣。質料要厚而輕軟。　從上面的樣式看來，可知今年的時裝，不像往年一樣，僅在長短寬窄中增减，而是整個式樣有了極大的改革。</p>
<p>談上海的時裝，實際上還是簡單得很，目前的一般情形，大家除了在春大衣上面動動腦筋以外，其餘服裝的式樣，還是相當的貧乏。至於上海目下流行的春大衣的樣子，多半還是脫胎於美國的服裝，雖然在歐美的春裝式樣，成許並不如此簡單，但是要迎合一般上海小姐的脾胃，那末其中當有相當大的出入和取捨了。</p>
<p>西裝袴短襖　輕便而活潑</p>
<p>至於目下上海流行的西裝褲和短襖，據一位時裝專家的意見，認為這在家常穿穿，的確很適宜，輕便而不累贅，至於要談到是不是「登大雅之堂」，則認為未必可能。所以結論是：長褲短襖的未來命運，還祗能侷處於家庭之間，充其量僅僅成為流行的「便裝」而已。若要談到交際塲中走走，宴會席上跑跑，則勢非另外動腦筋不可了。主要的原因，還是在於一件短襖太平凡了。同時，中國小姐的身材，給天賦限制住了，眞正適宜於穿短裝的，在純美觀點上說：恐怕一萬人中難得找出一二個是合式的來。</p>
<p>旗袍的式樣　不致有變動</p>
<p>旗袍，還是最適宜中國小姐穿的服裝。預料今年的旗袍式樣，不致有變更，不過據另一位專家說：一件旗袍的長短，最合宜的尺寸，最好仍由在膝蓋下二三寸的地位，過長了，固然不合時宜；過短了，在美觀上說，假使一對膝蓋露在外面，對整個身體的姿態而言，是有損而無增的。</p>
<p>英貨料雖好　國貨亦進步</p>
<p>說到衣料問題，當然最好的還是要推英國貨，其次的才可輸到美國貨。至於現在的中國呢絨，貨色的精美，實在並不遜於美國貨。據一位服裝專家的經騐談，中國呢絨的進步，已經與十年前大不同了。</p>
<p>目前上海流行大衣的價目，大約從三十萬元到一百五十萬元。其中的等次，大的五六十萬元的，可以做到美國貨和上等的中國貨。英國貨的時價，就要高到一百五六十萬了。</p>
<p>今年時裝業的情形，一般的說來，還相當發達。春天到了，正是上海小姐們動腦筋換季的時候，同時亦是時裝公司最忙的一個季節了。至於時裝以外的皮包與皮鞋，也最能影響到全身，今年流行的皮包，是有帶的長方形的式樣，兩面各有三欄或兩欄很深的紋略，那種令人厭惡的發光的玻璃皮包，將要送到博物館去陳列，沒人再問津了。皮鞋的式樣，則是光面的露出大足趾的軟木厚底鞋。</p>
<h3>「佛要金裝·人要衣裝」　怎樣選擇你的衣料</h3>
<p>春來了，楊柳已染上了新綠，花在開始抽芽，小草經風吹拂，顯得欣欣向榮，烏在枝頭活耀，奏着迎春之曲，寂寬的庭園，處處表示着熱鬧，新鮮。自然界是如此，人類又何獨不然？鄉村裹的小姑娘，活潑，天眞，但並不艷麗，並不引起人的注意，因為她祗有一副夭然的姿態。</p>
<p>選料</p>
<p>美麗的衣料，也好像自然界的景物，在那裏爭奇鬥艷。蔚藍好像是雨過天靑，嫩綠却似碧波漣漣，紅色像鮮艷的玫瑰，杏黃像嫡小的木榍。常踏入一家大的綢緞公司，五色繽紛，目為之眩，花式的繁多，正像夏雲一樣的複雜幻變。選擇的時候，確然是煞費苦心。</p>
<p>「佛要金裝，人要衣裝。」美麗的衣服，會把一個女子的年齡，减輕十歲，衣服有如此大的魔力，所以歸女們都想借重一下。可是衣服的美，不是絕對的，要看穿得是否適當。花紋是否相合，能否增加她的風韻，成為問題。一味東施效顰，必至醜態畢露　婦女們出去買衣料，是一件很費時間的事情，她們會在舖十裏揀上二三小時，可是回到家裏，結果還覺得所買的料子不對。她們知道衣服在修飾上是很重要的，所以不屑耗廢許多時間，不過不知選擇標準，這許多時間還不是白費的麼？</p>
<p>個性</p>
<p>選衣料須以自已為中心，以能顯出自己的個性為主，這不是標新立異，但也不可毫無主見地隨波逐流。所以要選擇衣服，先得明暸自己的特點，要將優點顯出來，劣點藏去纔好。一個人的特點，是很不容易分析的，大概說來，外表方面有高矮，肥瘠之不同，皮膚也有深淺的差異。內心方面，有的人是好動的，現出活潑的姿態，有的人是好靜的，具有矜持的個性，根據這幾點來選擇衣料，不中不遠矣！</p>
<p>你的身材怎樣呢？你的性格怎樣呢？</p>
<p>色彩</p>
<p>你明白了自己以後。我再來吿訴你選擇的方法。第一，是衣服的色彩。顏色有冷熱之異。所謂冷色，是藍，綠，白等淡色，相反地深的像紅，橙，紫，褐等為熟色。一個身材豐滿的人，適宜冷色，身材苗條約，穿熱色的更相配些。皮膚的深淺，和衣服顏色相反，皮膚潔白，可穿深色的衣服，黑黯的皮膚，不妨選得淡些，可是强烈的程度，不能相差得過遠。黑人穿着潔白的衣服，不是黑白更分明麼？就個性說：活潑的人穿淡的來得好，矜持的人，深色的更為適宜。</p>
<p>花紋</p>
<p>其次，是花紋的選擇。最近不是流行過大花紋的料子麼？這樣繁多的花紋，穿起來像一只斑虎，它是宜於身高而體態苗條約人，假使一個又矮又胖的人，還是選簡單的小花紋，大花紋將會顯其臃腫。條紋的料子，最易顯出一個人的肥瘠，苗條約人，應該穿直條約，豐滿的人，適宜於橫條。　衣料的質地，有軟，有硬。綢的本質，大都較軟，緞則比較硬些，從前很流行的織錦，也是硬性的。身體豐滿或個性活潑的，宜穿軟料，硬料子是宜於瘦小的人，或個性沉靜的人。　裁製式樣，也有出入。就長短說，有時通行長的，下擺快要遮掩脚背，通行短的，短及膝蓋。時電女十，當然要照最新的式樣去做，可是也得問問自已，不要做得太時式了。太短的衣服，適宜個十高的人，同時又能又能顯得活潑些，所以矮的人，或性格沉靜的，即是在流行短的時候，也不要太短了。鑄坎的圖狹，也隨着時代潮流而變動，闊的邊，瘦的，高的人穿了，顯得苗條些。矮或　滿的人，穿狹邊比較可以隱藏些。</p>
<p>穿衣是隨氣節而改變的。可是在這不冷不熱，又冷又熱的春天，最不容易確定。俗語謂：「二八月，亂穿衣。」所以這一點，在春天不妨略為忽視些，假使是夏天或冬天，便得特別注意了。</p>
<p>穿衣服的動機有三：（一）護體，（二）遮羞，（三）裝飾。因具有裝飾的作用，於是在形式上便發生了許多變化。</p>
<p>服裝的式形，可以分為七類：（一）勝利品的安置，（二）威赫作用，（三）性的引誘，（四）職業的表示，（五）性別的表示，（六）地城的特徵，（七）宗敎的信仰。女子的時裝，分析起來，第三類的成分為最多。</p>
<h3>春裝瑣話</h3>
<p>服裝上含有兩性作用的：（一）使身體增高，如穿高跟鞋，戴高帽子。（二）使身體增大或縮小，如廣袖，闊裙，束腰，束胸。（三）指示身體之特殊部位，在鼻，手，足，頸，腰等處，戴圓環或其他飾物。（三）狀身體某部的動作，如飄帶，鈴釧。</p>
<p>本來兩性間的引誘，在動物界中，利用色澤的很多。孔省開屏，蝴蝶揚翅，多是顯示美麗的顏色給異性看。原始時代的人，有文身的習俗，算是增加美觀。迨衣服發明後，文身是不再需要了。同是衣服的式樣，顏色，花紋，要比文身變化更多。但文身並未完全取銷，祗不過限於面部罷了。擦粉，搽脂，點唇，畫眉，甚至於染指甲，却是文身的變質。</p>
<p>穿衣是社會生活的一環，和社會政治經濟的變遷很有關係。大體說來，女子的服裝比男子的服裝變化得快，近三十年來，女裝更是瞬息萬變，這就表示近三十年來女子生活的突然改換，她們從幽閉的深閻繡房中解放出來，踏進了社會，並且從事職業，在服裝上自然也該大大的革命了。</p>
<h3>絨線大衣</h3>
<p>絨綫織物現在已算是很普通的衣着了，可是流行到中國來，僅有五十多年的歷史。是初絨繩的用途，只用以扎髮，至編織技術發明後，才推廣了絨綫的銷路。但那時用絨綫織成的東西，僅有帽子。手套。圍巾等件而己。用絨綫編織背心衣服，還是後來的事。</p>
<p>絨綫背心或衣服，最初大都是襯裏的，因其輕細溫暖，故甚風行。後來將絨綫衣從裏面搬到了外面，事情就多了，因為穿在外面，必須要顧到美觀，於是翻了許多新花樣。</p>
<p>最初穿在外面的，是絨綫背心，他代替了長的旗袍馬夾。及大衣盛行，絨綫背心已為時髦女子所捐棄了。</p>
<p>短袖旗袍流行後，在春寒料峭時，兩截玉臂露在外面，似乎覺得冷一些，於是有人設法製一件短的絨綫衫，罩在旗袍外，旣减少了長旗抱的單調，又增加了體態的苗條，一雙玉臂，遮在絨綫衫襄面，也不會受冷了。後來軍在旗袍外面的絨綫衫，袖子由長而短，短至沒有了，那時兩臂重復從絨綫中解放出來。至此絨綫衣純粹成為旗袍外面的裝飾品，一無禦寒的意義了。　近來，旗袍外的那件絨綫衫，又改了式樣，從短及乳部，延長至臀部，袖子重新又伸長出來了。這樣一來，不成為短絨綫衫，而是一件絨綫大衣。</p>
<p>皮的或是駱駝毛的大衣，當然不能家常穿，即是呢大衣，在家裏穿，總不像樣，做起事來又不大方便，絨綫大衣有大衣之名，而無大衣之累，可以家常穿着，又不會妨磗做事。同時絨綫織物，染了貪跡，可以拆掉，洗過重結。絨綫大衣就沒有皮大衣那樣華貴，呢大衣那樣大方，但穿在旗袍外，也可以免去色澤的單調</p>
<p>自從民國二十二年天津羝羊牌絨綫廠在上海開展聲會，公開傳授編織方法以來，從此編織式樣，時常翻新。現今所流行的絨綫大衣，花樣更是巧妙，除了編織技巧之外，還有許多花繡在上面，更增加了美觀。</p>
<p>編結是一種很簡易的女紅，無論何處多可以做。有許多女職員，常把絨綫帶至辦公室中，在無公可辦的時候，就從抽屜中拿出來結一會，女學校的敎室中，許多女學生就一面聽講，一面編結。她們已是熟能生巧，不必加以思索了。</p>

<p>巴黎，是世界藝術的首都，巴黎的時裝，誘惑得全世界的娘兒們着了迷。有人要問，巴黎的時裝專家，怎樣來栽製今年的新裝？怎樣把這新式樣流行到世界每一個大都市裏去呢？其實，所謂新裝，祇是把舊的式樣稍為加以更改，或者別出心裁地添上些小花樣，就算是新樣了。時代的潮流，不停的動盪着，婦女的服裝，也是後浪推前浪地時時在改變，經過一個時期以後，也許古舊的花樣，仍會流行起來。至於能否將一種新花樣推行至全世界，這完全是時裝專家的魔力，一個不甚可解的謎。</p>
<p>一九四七年的巴黎時裝，當今表演時，有千萬件的衣裳，千萬件的大衣，從式樣講，都是大同小異，稱做「曼第克式」，通俗一點，不妨說是「浪漫式」。一件緊裏着身段的上衣，配上一條較長的裙，顯出搖搖欲墮的樣兒，充分表現一個病態美的女子的苗條身材，這種式樣，已漸漸回復到一九二〇年的式樣。</p>
<p>皮料已成為衣服上主要裝飾品，領子。袖口。下擺。都用皮鑲坎着，頸項則藏在皮領之中。闊邊的帽子，再加上二三尾美麗的羽毛，也是今年的新花樣，婦女們將頭髮挽於頂上，戴上這士帽子，在巴黎街頭，可以傲視同伴了。</p>
<p>紐約的時裝，很多和巴黎不同。穿狹的上裝，圓領開到胸前，小袖子齊及肘際。下面一條半短的裙子，遮及膝蓋，下擺却比以前寬大得多。穿了走起路來，帶幾分飄飄然的樣兒。</p>
<p>新大陸上婦女的思想，是最新不過的，她們除了身體上幾處量惹人注意的地方外，其餘都在可能範圍內將他解放出來。已經流行的晚裝，上身除了一對乳眾外，全部是赤裸裸的，而所謂乳罩，也不是過去用帶子繫着，藏在衣服裏的，現在旣已露在外面，再用帶子，似乎已經追不上時代了，所以祗有兩個半圖形的鋼絲環，罩在乳房之上。</p>

<h3>評「元詞律」</h3>
<p>— 蔡正華</p>
<p>王玉章纂輯　商務印書館版　卷一至卷四已出卷五至卷十在印刷中</p>
<p>在今日講元曲，自免不了紙上談兵。吾們旣不能起元人於地下，何從知其唱泆？關於曲律，自「太和正音譜」，以至「北詞廣正譜」，無論其若何精審，也皆知其然而不知其所以然，往往聚訟紛紜，莫衷一是。然亦猶幸有此數書，得以略知元人之矩矱。北詞廣正譜，善則善矣，却仍有疏漏的地方，所謂「字句不拘，可以增損」者，有時竟不知其所增何句，所减何句也。</p>
<p>用治經治史的方法來治曲，乃是近來的事。由於用科學方法來歸納，使吾們對於北曲譜，更多一層認識。吳瞿安主講東南大學時，曾寫過一部「南北詞簡譜」，集衆說之長，自是經心結撰之作，但只是一本簡譜。繼之而起者，有王玉章的「元詞斠律」。此書於民國廿五年，由商務書館印行，祗有四卷。第一卷為黃鍾宮，第二卷正宮，第三卷大石調，第四卷仙呂宮，是為上編。歷時三載，始得脫稿。未幾，倭寇禍作，作者避難入川，久久未績。下編初稿，留存滬上，雖遭兵亂，幸未遺失。最近始由作者窮日夜之力足成之，計第五卷中呂宮，第六卷南呂宮，第七卷雙調，第八卷越調，第九卷商調，第十卷般涉調，合為下編，仍由商商務書館印行，不久即將問世。</p>
<p>這部書的纂輯方法，是把臧晋叔「雕蟲館曲選」中所有的曲，排比起來，鈞稽異同，以求準繩。態度旣然十分謹愼，自與「郢書燕說」不同。平心而論，現在研究元人樂律，百此而外，亦別無可靠途徑。吳瞿安序云：</p>
<p>「自太和正音譜而下，當以北詞廣正譜為最善，顯猶有以點板太密為病者。抑知北詞無定板，就文字之多寡，為板式之疏密，而其聲即隨之為轉移。又上下板移易處，歌者高下閃賺，極聲文之美，此又隨曲聲之勢變為準者也。是以玄玉多點數板，為作詞製譜者要刪之地，此正廣正譜之勝處，而聚訟紛亂，亦在於是。玉章此書，全不點板，僅就詞句之共同，為原其所以然之故，而於增句，格式，煞曲之互異，亦旁證梳剔之，息諸家之爭，啓後學之惑，其有裨於藝林者，豈鮮少哉。」</p>
<p>他又說：「或謂北詞句調，實無定程，如寄生草首二句，三字也，而白仁甫長醉後何妨礙，不醒時有甚思，則六字句矣。朝天子首二句二字也，而汪元亨榮華夢一塲，功名紙半張，則五字句矣。板旣可增，句復無定，不可範前哲，亦無足示復賢也。雖無譜何害也。不知作家增字，盡文心之變，律家定譜，立詞法之正，苟以句法之歧異，不復通其癥結，勢必凌亂無序，標題某曲，實非此曲之式，湯若士所謂拗折嗓子者此也。玉章此舉，又曷可少也。」</p>
<p>那末有此一書，吾們對於樂律上的爭執，多少可以有點依據了。不過話又得說回來。據作者例言：「每卷所收曲調，一以臧錄之有無而定去取。臧氏錄元劇至富，後代莫及。吾人試以臧錄為矩範，本書律度為楷模，染翰作劇，已游刃有餘，何待他求。故正續四廂，古今雜劇，以及奢摩他窒所藏元劇，槪未羼入。」這是民國廿三年的話。民國三十年，也是園所藏元明雜劇，忽發現於海上。全書七十二册，都二百六十九種，缺八册，凡二十七種。除已見之元曲選及近時印本者九十四種，重複之本四種，計得往昔未見之本百日十四種。元詞斠律所依據者為臧選，連明初六種在內，也不過百種。就現存元劇之總數而言，尙不及其半。纂輯方法，旣屬比類條列，自應求其全備，方易歸納。在當時旣未見也是園的藏本，當然無從比較。由此可知研究學問，後人或反較前人占得許多便宜也。</p>
<p>好在例言中又云：「元人散詞，流傳今代者，的計二十餘種，而羣珠羣玉諸錄不與焉。異日擬別為一集，故本書未涉是項資料。」然則新發現的元劇，將來也可別為一集，或者最好彙在一起，則其中異同之故一目了然，所得證據，也更堅强有力了。</p>
<h3>校讐與目錄</h3>
<p>— 合盛</p>
<p>書名：「校讐目錄學篡要」</p>
<p>編著者：蔣伯潛</p>
<p>出版者：正中書局</p>
<p>出版年月：民三十五年十二月</p>
<p>童致旋氏在馬導源著「書誌學」（民二十三年商務本）一書的序內說：「尙古結繩以治，進而造書契，乃用版策，乃用竹帛，乃用紙素，再進而有雕版焉。印刷之術旣興，書籍之用愈廣，七略四庫，浩若烟海，或分別部居，以明類例，或解題考證，以申述評，於是有目錄之學焉。流傳久遠，譌奪斯生，或有錯簡衍文，或則魯魚亥豕，於是有校譽之學焉。漢有石經，唐刻佛典，宋槧元刋，殿版坊本，或較其裝璜，或辨其行格，於是有版本之學焉。」</p>
<p>可見目錄學，校響學，與版本學三者都有密切關係，依歷史上之需要而逐漸產生；然各有各的專責，各有各的界限，固亦不能混而為一。普通訊究目錄學者，向以「校響」與「目錄」之兩種工作，視為一貫，不能分的；今據童氏所述，「校響」與「目錄」明為兩件事，而「版本」又為一件事。可見目錄學範圍之廣，似無可異議。蓋研究目錄學，實有兩種觀點，一為狹義的，一為廣義的。就狹義而言，則校響指校勘書籍的文字篇卷而言，目錄指編次某一書的篇目，或編次某一類書，乃至各類書的書目而言。就廣義而言，校響學實包括目錄學在內，自鄭樵章學誠二氏之說盛行後，廣義的校譽學，不但包括目錄學，而且認為當偏重目錄之學，甚至包括版本之學；日久由狹義的校讐學，產生了目錄學與版本學自成一種學問的趨勞，即是近人所述，亦皆係廣義的校響學。</p>
<p>本書旨在纂述廣義的校讐學之大要，但為使讀者易於明瞭所述的範圍起見，並舉「校譽」「目錄」二者以名之；換而言之，即分述校勘編目兩種工作，並兼及版本之學。全書分上下兩編，佔二〇四面；上編述校書編目學的歷史，分官書校錄，私家校錄，史志目錄，專門目錄，宗敎目錄，及其他特殊目錄等等；下編述校譽目錄學的內容，分微求書本，校正文字，釐定篇章，撰述敍錄，鑒別正偽，佚輯蒐文，分類編目等等。</p>
<p>校譽學的書很多，前有漢劉向之校響學宋鄭樵之校譽略（通志二十略之一），淸章學誠之校警通義（章氏遺書本），近人有杜定友之校警新義（中華民國十九年排印本），胡樸安胡道靜之校譽學（商務民二十年排印本），傅振倫之校譽新論（載圖書館學季刋第五卷第二期民國二十年六月），蔣元卿之校譽學史（商務民二十四年排印本）等等。</p>
<p>校響學者，向種為治書之學，為研究學問的基本工作，亦為治學者之量重要的工作；蓋治書之對象為書本。而書本為治學者所不可少之工具，故治學者於狹義廣義言之，均須明瞭治書之學；治學者旣以書本為根據，則校響之學，不能不重視矣，校讐旣如此之重要，則狹義之校讐學，不能盡治書之責，其必須包括狹義之校讐學，目錄學，及版本學也明矣。換言之，治書之學，亦即廣義的校警學。</p>
<p>近今圖書館事業日廣，研究圖書館學者日衆，然推其實際，從事圖書館事業有，鮮有研究目錄學，更無有研究校響及版本學者。校譽旣為治書之學，則研究圖書館學者，及從事岡書館事業者，須兼習目錄及校響之學，並須研究版本之學，則探本求原，可謂盡治書之道矣。今之辦圖書館事業者極重視分類編目等工作，而對於校譽工作及版本研究，頗多忽視；因之對於整個圖書館學，未能盡研究學問之道。今讀蔣氏之「校讐目錄學篡要」一書，可謂得治書方法之要領，特為研究圖書館學及目錄學者介紹。</p>
<h3>物理學計算題解法</h3>
<p>— 王維廉王止善合編·中華書局版</p>
<p>物理學是一種需要計算的科學，但是一般的物理學敎科書，都忽略了這一點，往往對於某些高深的理論有着膚淺的介紹，而對於許多基本的原理，缺乏切實的討論。所以許多學生在讀完了高中和大學的學程後，對於物理學一科，仍然是印象糢糊，不知究竟，要想這樣的學生，能够進一步研究學術，有所發現，眞是綠本求魚。我認為要求中國學者，能够在科學上有所貢獻，倒不在於派人出國留學和多買點外國維誌新書作為參考，而是在於使中國學生，普遍的對於各種基本原理，有深切的理會和了解，本固未茂。國內科學氣氛，才能逐漸濃厚一點，與世界各國並駕齊驅。經多年的搜求，終於發現了這本奇書——王維廉王止善合著中華書局出版的物理學計算題解法。</p>
<p>在這本書裏，沒有不着邊際的理論，沒有引人人勝的辭藻，只有一則又一則的題目，和一行又一行的數字，分上下兩册，十二章，各種問題數千則。</p>
<p>任何一個學生，能修對於這本書有十分的了解，則其對於物理學中各種基本原理的應用和練習，可算是思過半矣。所以我說這本書，是一本奇書。</p>
<p>尤其在中國，一般的著者和譯者，都喜歡弄玄虛，譯深晦艱吳的名著，述不着邊際的理論，以誇於人，這本書的價値，更加値得重視，因為他是從事於基本工作的。十年之後，中國科學界對於物理方面，若能有所收穫，這本書是那收穫的種子。</p>
<p>看完這本書之後，一方面感到牠是一本奇書，同時也有點感到不足。科學是前進不息，日新月異的，這本書在出版有年的今日，似乎有增改的必要。</p>
<p>一切問題的研究，均有一定的路徑，就是「明其理，熟其法，窮其變」。這本書，能使一般學生，在與敎本參照下，達到「明其理」的地步，但是還不能使一般學生百份之一百的達到「熟其法的地步，希望該書的編制，能略加改動，採用例題習題制，在原書中，有許多問題可以歸納成一類的，應該設法歸成一類而舉一個例題，如原書膨脹章，41，43，45，46，50，54，61，62，63，64諸題，均可用P1V1/T1＝　式以解之，故似乎但列其題即可，不必加以解算，令學生自己去解。較易收熟其法的效果，又如原書膨脹章，39，74，75，56，79諸題，變化孔多，似應化為公式題，而於每題之下，附習題，少則四五則，多則十餘則，乃至百餘則，以供學生演算，又如原書，比熱章，44題可為例題，而同章之41，42，43，則可附於其下，作為習題，如此易使學生對於各種現象，生明確之印象，筆者早歲曾試為之，因困於學力及旁務，終未能成，二位先生不棄，當另文詳述其方法，以為奉吿，並求正高明也。</p>
<p>例題之作，比較困難，因一般書上，多不刋載，而難誌之中，亦不甚見，故全在於著者個人之努力，將平日所見題自分別歸類，才能得到。而每個例題下所附習題目，在原則上，應該採取國內各大學中學之入學試題及平常測騐題，及有名實騐之數字，並於每題之末，註出正確答數，及其出處，可使兩用之效。</p>
<p>有許多問題，有幾個解法，如落體之計算可以用落體公式解，也可以用位能與動能之關係解，書中似應特別指出，並就同題，用異解，以引起學生的興趣。</p>
<p>有許多公式，其單位需特別注意，有許多運算，極易發生錯誤，需要特別注意者，似乎均應採取旁註法，一一註出，如此可以減少學生因偶爾疏忽而生之學習錯誤。</p>
<p>我還有一個希望，就是希望該書能有改訂的機會，而成為在校中讀書學生的習題講義，自修學生的指導良師，給學物理的人一條入門之路，給學過物理的人一本常用手册。</p>
<p>這本書，雖不百分之一百的好，但是在缺乏中文科學書的今日，每個有志理工的靑年，應人手一册，同時為第二代想王維康與王止善先生有將該書修訂得更加完美，宏富和淸浙的責任。</p>

<h3>「讀書指導」</h3>
<p>— 黃維廉　李伯嘉編·共三輯·商務版</p>
<p>商務印書館前於民國二十三年，一方面為增進讀者興　，一方面為適應時代的需要，替當時提倡讀書運動者開一新導綫，解決如何讀書這個問題，特於該館「出版週刋」內，增闢護書指導一　，廣約國內各科學術專家，撰述各種科學研究法，逐期登載，頗得讀者之贊許；後來將已披露的各篇文字，彙刋為單行本，便利讀者，而價流傳。可見讀書之道，不是隨便可以着手的；要知讀書要有方法，才可不費時間，而獲得相當效果。</p>
<p>本書彙集十年內商務出版的「出版週刋」讀書指導欄內登較的各篇文字，前後已出三輯，共收人各科研究法九十六篇，內容所包括的學科有三十六類，分總類，圖書館學，經學，哲學，心理，倫理，佛堅，社會，天文，化學，物理，地質學，生物學，植物學，工業，醫學，生理學，工程，礦物學，農業，家政，藝術，文學，歷史，地理，考古。三輯中所收的門類，頗多雷同者，但各篇命題，並無重複。每篇的撰述人，都是國內負有時望的專門學者，他們用淺顯的文字，透徹的理論，將古今中外學者所採用的研究方法，與他們自己的經騐，融會貫通，為讀者開　新的途徑，不但使讀者對於高深的學術，可於最短時間，獲得研究的門徑，並且還能誘導初學者在理論上與實際上作精密的探對，俾易獲得谷科學術的奧妙。</p>
<p>茲將所刋篇目略舉一二為例：於研究哲學方面有張東蓀之怎樣研究哲學，與馮友蘭之怎樣研究中國哲學史；政治方面有楊幼炯之怎樣研究政治學；經濟方面有唐慶增之經濟學研究法，李權時之財政學研究法，與潘序倫之怎樣研究會計學；敎育方面有艾偉之怎樣研究敎育心理學；科學方面有李儼之怎樣研究中國算學史，與王　之化學研究法等；工程方面有趙曾珏之工程怎樣研究與選擇；語文方面有黎錦熙之怎樣研究國語；文學方面有張資平之小說研究，與伍蠡甫之怎樣研究西洋文學；歷史方面有呂思勉之怎樣續中國歷史等等。　近世科學昌明，日新月異，且各科學術之著書立說，浩若烟海，如欲瀏覽軍集，亦勢所不能；况凡事貴在得其門徑，旣有門徑，從而潛心研討，便可事半功倍。所以欲使學者得一最適宜的指導，不致浪費實貴的光陰，而獲得相當圓滿的效果，更是一種急切的需要。</p>
<p>本書於每輯之末，並有各撰述人的履歷，使讀者對於他們的學歷，可以得着一番更深切的認識。蔡元培先生在第一輯序內曾說，道本書是像呂仙洞賓的指頭，可點石成金，他的特點是便於自修，便於參考，便於增加常識，是眞可謂讀書指導的南針，希望將來再能繼績出書，俾可成為一種百科指導全書。</p>
<h3>讀「罪與罰」</h3>
<p>— 東淵</p>
<p>陀思妥夫斯基作　韋叢蕪譯　上海文光書店印</p>
<p>行三十五年十二月新版全譯本分裝上下兩</p>
<p>集售價一六〇〇〇元</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>陀思妥夫斯基的這著作，可以說是他的小說中主妥的作品，它是在世界上，得到廣大讀者的歡迎。在中國，同樣地不能例外，譯本也有數種，在幾種譯本中，當推韋叢蕪先生的譯本為最佳。</p>
<p>韋譯的全譯本，也有它一段歷史；譯者在最近新版的序言中說得很明白：這書在戰前的七年中，曾印了五版，這當然是中國讀者的進步。即使是出版者方面，也由「未明」版轉入「開明」版，此後，因戰時而停印了九年。直至最近，又由「開明」版轉入了「交光」版，以一副新的面目，顯現在讀者的面前。</p>
<p>在今日，出版條件如此艱難的環境下，許多文學巨著的都能重印，如「約翰。克利斯朶夫」，「戰爭與和平」，和這「罪與罰」等等，此誠然是出版中可喜的現象，這是讀書界所希望保持和發展的。</p>
<p>我們現在所讀到的，當然為文光新版。在作者眞實的文筆下，使我緊緊地乘着每一個空暇，趕快讀畢這作品，一點也不願放過任何一個閱讀的機會。爽快地說：是牠活生生的現實故事，吸引住了我、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>這作品，是以悲慘而窮苦的靑年——拉思科里湟珂夫為主角，作者運用迫眞的文筆，寫出了他的悲慘生活，以及殘酷的社會給予他的遭遇。</p>
<p>拉思（拉思涅科里珂夫簡稱）原來是以敎書度日，而在最近他失去了敎書的職業。家衰又是很窮，祗有的一個母親和妹妹，全依於恤金來過生活。拉思在失業以後，生活窘困日益，他無法，就祗有拿他的東西到一個專重利放債的老女人那裏去典當，她是剝削刻薄稱著的老婦人，非但重利而且當的東西一過期就沒收由此她也積起了不少錢。而拉思是連父親遣留下來的錶都當給她了。內心的鬱鬱憤恨，是很深刻的。</p>
<p>當拉思走到酒店裏去，企圖用酒的刺激來消除憂憤的時候，在那兒，所見的酒徒都是與他一般地是來用酒想解除內心苦楚的；尤其是窮書記沙哈羅維夫，他更向拉思述出了許多苦楚。</p>
<p>在各方面，拉思是增加了他底憤怒與憂愁。並在次日他的妹妹有信給他，她說願意為哥哥的前途幸福，而嫁給一個有餞的老商人。當拉思讀到這信後，內心憂亂的錯綜複雜，他心頭是掀起了無限的怒火，他恨這世界的殘忍，越恨，怒火越是無窮地升起，由此，他是懷着了殺人的思念，而且，還很想來發洩。</p>
<p>由這思念，他就回家拿了一柄利斧，到他所懷恨已久的放債老婦人那兒去。到了那兒，一見她很快地就幾斧把她殺死；而正欲拿她的錢的時候，外面來了老婦的妹妹，他驚慌之下，又把她殺死了。接着外面又有人叩門，他匆匆地拿了她的錢袋逃走。</p>
<p>他逃回家以後，潔白的良心，是加上了無窮重的枷鎖，他昏迷了，痛苦地，好多天就客着昏熱病。</p>
<p>此後，他由於他的一個新結識的愛人——娼婦索尼亞的勸吿，而去自首。索尼亞雖墮落為娼，而她的靈魂是純潔的，勸吿了拉思去自首以後，結果是由於心理學家證實，他從輕祗判了八年罪。</p>
<p>這八年中，他雖被發配到西伯利亞作苦工，而在苦工的工作中，使他覺悟，他並看見新的道路，懷望着他們的新的未來，信奉基督，並給予他們新的希望！</p>
<p>我未便把全部梗概都說在這裏。以上，是這作品的主要部份，這作品就是以這為主題的表演了出來。（一一一）</p>
<p>這著作所描寫的，全以下層階級為主人翁，這些是為某些作家以為卑賤的，而它，是公正地把他們寫出來，並且還表明出他們的表面上被人覺得卑賤，而內心却是純白的，靈魂是整潔的。</p>
<p>作者本人，一向是在窮苦的磨難之中，他曾被判過死刑，也曾被解到西伯利亞去當過苦工。所以，作者本身的經歷的豐當，使之在他筆下所寫出來的，是一幕現實的反映，活的生活的表演。</p>
<p>作者一生，從沒有過着幸福的日子，但在他痛苦的一生中，却產生了許多不能磨滅的巨著，我們很容易就能舉幾部出來：一窮人」，「被侮辱與被損害的」，「死靈魂」，「自痴」，等等；「罪與罰」也是其中主要的一部。他的成就，是不容否認識的，全世界都不能否認，因為他的作品，是從現實生活的血和肉之中，鍛鍊出來的。</p>
<p>有人說，陀氏的作品，不及屠格涅夫的那樣細緻，那是不錯的。正因為他沒有像屠格涅夫一般的時間來細心修改，他是等着他的作品以換生活的。但，這並不能掩沒了他的成就，形式上雖不及屠氏的鈿緻，內容方面價値是很高的。</p>
<p>至於他時常把主人翁歸結到基督的名下，這是他宗敎的信仰。但，他不同於一般說敎者，因為他是給人以新的向善的道路。本盡譯者也有說明。</p>
<p>總之，在他筆下，寫出了被壓迫——被侮辱與被損害了的人們的痛苦境遇，懷着偉大的同情，揭露出眞實來！</p>

<p>醜人能自知其醜，在所有的醜人中，這是一個了不得的英雄。至於他的愛美心理，亦不失為好傾向。飛蛾殉火，醜人殉美；成為蟲類和人類的光榮奇蹟。</p>
<p>飛蛾死後宜追封火德炎漢將軍；醜人死後宜追隘為美忠懲公。</p>

<h3>氣候不正與時疫</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>近來報上常見時疫蔓延的消息，如天花，白喉，以至於腦膜炎等等，都是染上了可以致命的東西，因此看見了這類的消息，總不禁為之悚然，而感到生命隨時可以斷送的恐懼和憂慮。</p>
<p>這些時疫的起因，我們每每歸之於氣候的不正常，好像老天有意跟我作對一般。而看看氣候，忽冷忽熱，忽而起風，忽而下雨，似乎眞正不大正常。一班人平日見面，總學不到「今天天氣哈哈哈」的含養功夫，要異口同聞把老天埋怨一頓。照我們的理想，彷彿一年四季的寒暑雨雪，都應該像日落與日出一樣有一定的時間，有一定的進程，尤其是氣候的溫度，要慢慢地在寒暑表上按着時序，一點一滴由春到夏爬上去，又由秋到冬爬下來，中間不可有其他的進退，像現在這種狂拋巨浸，大上大落，尤其在絕對禁止之列。</p>
<p>不幸老天却沒有這麼刻板，同時據地理學家說，像我們所居住的寒溫帶，正因為有這種乍暖驟寒的變化，才予人類以刺激，而產生出其他各帶所達不到的文明來。這就是說，在這個，總不肯正常的氣候之下，旣能產生高度的文明，也能產生可怕的瘟疫；文明乎，瘟疫乎，還在於我們自己的選擇，因為寒暑表上的水銀是製造不出這些個東西來的。項羽在東城被圍的時候嘆息道：「此天之亡我，非戰之罪也」，我們今日實在沒有資格笑此古人了。</p>
<p>天花，白喉，與腦膜炎等等，每年此時，總要光臨一下。這些疫癘如果有靈，他們一定要跟我們同聲咒駡氣候：</p>
<p>「不正常的東西！你看我們，每年從不脫研誤點，來得多麼正常！」</p>
<h3>「綠化」運動</h3>
<p>— 青紋</p>
<p>戰後的日本，因幅員大縮（其實較之七十年前的日本領土，並未减縮，蓋其現在所縮者，都是過去侵略得來的），工業又受了限制，且得償付賠款，怎樣去應付種種的經濟問題，誠是大費腦筋。</p>
<p>現在據說日本決計想做「亞洲的瑞士」了。最近且發動了「綠化運動」；綠化運動者，就是使全國變成一座「花園國」，藉以吸引外國旅客前往觀光，換句話說，即是想「套取」外匯。為了這個綠化運動，日皇裕仁且從他的「御園」中撥出數萬株樹苗，以為提倡。</p>
<p>我們不反對日本變成一亞洲的瑞士」，如果此後的日本當眞能變得像瑞士一樣的和平；而「綠化」更好，因為在「白化」的新大陸與「赤化」的蘇聯間，讓日本的「綠化」來做橋樑，對於世界和平是會有相當帮助的。不過我們不希望日本用「緣化」運動做幌十，企岡在「白化」與「赤化」的對峙間，翻起昔日的舊夢。</p>
<h3>「歡喜寃家」——一部新的傳記片</h3>
<p>— 碧</p>
<p>海倫司梯文斯馬克西生於一八四〇年，死於一九一大年，是十九世紀末業至二十世紀初期的一位大發明家，經其發明而呈請註册專利的，計有一百九十二件之多，第一次呈請專利在一八六六年，他改良了鍊鐵的方法，把厚鐵彎成圓形，作為製造炸彈之用，最後一次在一九一六年，研究碳化氫成功，對於飛機的製造，供戲良多。</p>
<p>雖然是一個科學家，罵克西並不如人們想像中的嚴肅，冷靜和不近人情，自然，在研究的時候，他是很嚴蕭冷靜的，可是在家庭生活中，他却是一個極風趣的人物，製造的笑料十倍於他的發明，比如說他會帶着他的兒子用豆彈警察，或是向一羣小鷄作催眠實騐等。</p>
<p>馬克西的事蹟，現已由環球公司攝成電影，向來傳記片都是董重於科學的發明，可是這一部却只取他的戀愛家庭故事，在這裏他不是一個大發明家而是一個忠實的丈夫，風趣的爸爸，由好萊塢的標準爸爸唐亞曼契和標準妻子茂娜洛埃分飾馬克西夫妻，由童星鮑培德立司哥飾他們的兒子。別以為將大發明家演成一個小丑是無中生有的事，此片故事完全根據馬克西的兒子潘賽所寫的回憶錄「家庭中的天才」“AGenius　In　The　Family”一書而編成，其眞確性是百分之百的。</p>
<p>此片譯名是「歡喜寃家」，定於廿七日起在美琪上映，是一部別開生面的喜劇型傳記片。</p>

<h3>發冷劑</h3>
<p>— 白告</p>
<p>美國紐約市的一位業餘化學者薛頓在十年以前，住在巴西國時，就從事於業餘的化學研究。他感到他的進出口業中需要一種可供即時應用的粉末，如發冷劑，於是着手試騐，不久便發現有數百種化學品在反應時都能吸收熱量。可是這些化學品都不能滿足一般應用上所必備的三個條件，即是：價廉，無害，和化學地安定。然後每當業餘之時，他就在里的熱內慮省他的家庭實騐室內繼續他的溫和分析，看守和試騐的工作。這樣的的歷八年之久，共計拋棄了二百五十餘種認為無用的化學品，結果竟解決了三大問題之二：他製成了若干種無毒而價廉的發冷物質，但是這些物質曝露於空氣之中時，都不能保持不壞。</p>
<p>有一次，他試騐到將近天亮時，始離開實騐室而就寢。連這决實騐而得的製成品——一杯混合粉末都不高與把它藏起，却讓它從空氣中徐徐吸收水份而變成一種無用的漿。四小時後精神和雄心恢復，他又走進了實騐室預備「重整旗鼓」，當他伸手去倒那杯化學品時，忽然發見杯中物乾硬得好像骨頭一般，興奮極了一，他加入若干水，那溶液竟變為冷極！</p>
<p>在心神稍微鎭靜之後，薛頓偶然看看實騐桌上方的藥品架，發見少量粉末狀藥品，從最高層架上撒到桌上那杯內所留下的痕跡。稍加注意，又發見盛着這種粉末的瓶倒在架上，瓶塞已經脫落。顯然地，此瓶是打翻的，但是是誰呢？在瓶的近傍，睡熟着他所養着的愛猴，它已無意中帮助它的主人達到一個偉大的目的。這瓶粉末狀藥品，前此並沒有試用過，竟然完成了他的方劑。</p>
<p>然後薛頓便把他的發明的標本分送給世界各處的友人，以便試騐它所受各種氣候的影響。結果都十分圓滿，現在市塲上已經有他的發冷粉出售了。但中國有沒有，筆者不得而知了。</p>
<h3>新聞綱</h3>

<p>據說一萬元大票決定不發了。這可以有兩種看法：（一）美國的伍億美元貸款，馬上可以到手，通貨可以緊縮；（二）經濟緊急措施辦法實施後，物價將趨下落。</p>
<p>究竟是那一種對呢？我們猜不透。</p>
<p>一位偽督察長，自己提名呌「饒恕」，受審時，向法官大呼「饒恕」。可見此人良心未泯。但「奸偽」未被檢舉，而已被「饒恕」的人却太多了。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>關想跟上去，小沈却把她勸住了，而五歲不到的榮兒也哭着拌開了金愛麗的手，要媽抱他。這時候每個人所表現的緊張的情緒，已使他的小小的心靈上也激起了一種預兆似的恐懼。</p>
<p>「來！小弟弟，我抱你！」小沈堆着滿臉的笑，想逗引榮兒。他聽了方才老祝臨去時對那少媢所用的親密的稱謂心裏老是覺得酸溜溜的不大自在，現在他想盡量利用這個空隙，和老祝競賽一下。可是榮兒偏不成全他，祇扭緊了他媽，連頭也不回。</p>
<p>蘭自己把他抱了起來，順便像道謝似的向小沈看了一限。</p>
<p>「胡太太，走吧！我給你領路！日本飛機當眞來了！」小沈用手指了指天空。果然，飛機的聲吾愈來愈響了，並且好像有十來架之多。</p>
<p>赤鼻子的諸老頭兒用着含有邪意的目光向金愛麗看了也有半天了，當蘭果眞隨着小沈打那玻璃長窗裏走出去的時候，他便向她有會地一笑，也不管對方有無反響，他就搶上一步，拉住了她的手，搶着往外走。</p>
<p>「金小姐，我們也走吧！」他低聲地說，心裹非常興奮。</p>
<p>金愛麗不敢得罪他，只用力掙脫了自己的手，便默默地隨着他走出去；後面像滾一樣的追上來了徐紹明和阿史，老徐左手　裏夾着一只極胖的公事包，右手正用毛巾在擦自己臉上和頭頸裹的汗，阿史肩上抗着一口不太大的皮箱，分量顯得很沉重。阿史後面還有一個梳長辮拖木屐的廣東女下人。</p>
<p>防空洞並不遠，五六分鐘之後，徐家這一羣人已經都聚在裏面了；小沈極賣力地搶到了一修靠　的長凳，還用他的雪自的手中揩拭了好一會，才像捧鳳凰似的把那少婦扶過去，讓她和榮兒很寬適地坐着，一面忙從衣袋裏掏出一只極精緻的香烟匣來，小心地遞過一支烟去。</p>
<p>「對不起，不會抽烟！」閘强笑　　絕，她心裏只在惦記着緋緋，並沒有法　到小沈臉上所浮現的那種不大誠實的　氣。</p>
<p>小沈把那枝烟掛在自己嘴角上抽着，同時又偷偷地向那一張急得變成蒼白色的俏臉看了幾眼，徐胖子是最後跨進防空河的一個，瞧別處沒有座位，便覽過來，　在小榮左邊坐了。（二）（六）</p>

<h3>The Supreme National Defense Council Approves: Issuing $400 Million in Bonds to Stabilize Finance and Regulate Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Supreme National Defense Council held a routine meeting on the morning of the 26th, presided over by Chairman Chiang himself, and approved: (1) A proposal to issue US$300 million in short-term treasury bills for the 36th year of the Republic; (2) A proposal to issue US$100 million in US dollar bonds. Both proposals have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan and will soon complete legislative procedures. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The fixed amount of short-term treasury bills for the 36th year of the Republic is US$300 million, which will be used to stabilize finance and encourage savings.

One-sixth of the principal will be repaid on average every six months, with interest decreasing along with the principal. The collateral will be several designated units from state-owned production enterprises and enemy-puppet industries that are prepared for sale. The proceeds from the sale will be primarily used to cover each maturing principal and interest payment. If there is a shortfall, the Ministry of Finance will allocate funds to make up for it, and a fund supervision committee will be established to manage the fund. The method of sale will be based on the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate, with US dollars converted into national currency for sale.

One-twentieth of the principal will be repaid by lottery every six months. Twelve months prior to each repayment, the same amount of US dollars will be pre-allocated from the foreign exchange fund of the bank for reserve payment, and a fund supervision committee will be established to manage the fund. The issue price will be based on the full face value. Purchasers can pay with: 1) US dollar deposits or currency; 2) Other foreign currency deposits or currency converted; 3) Gold.

The Bureau was ordered to inform the prisoner that if he could respond to the uprising when the Allied forces landed on the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, or if he could ensure the order of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou before and after the surrender of the enemy so that the people would not suffer, he would be allowed to atone for his crimes and observe the results, etc. It was ruled that the prisoner could be spared death, and the matter was submitted to the Judicial Yuan for legal deliberation. According to the report, since the prisoner was able to ensure the order of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou before and after the surrender of the enemy, so that the people would not suffer, he did make a contribution to the security of society. Whether the prisoner's original death sentence can be reduced to life imprisonment shall be reported for review. In accordance with the provisions of Article 68 of the Provisional Constitution, the prisoner Zhou Fohai's original death sentence is reduced to life imprisonment. This order.</p>

<h3>The Third Plenary Session Approved the Full Text of the Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Third Plenary Session, in its general meeting on the afternoon of the 24th, revised and approved the economic reform plan submitted by the Economic Review Committee. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Review of the Past</p>
<p>Our country's economy today faces a severe crisis, which is undeniable. Upon careful examination, the greatest cause of this situation is the destructive consumption of the long-term war, which has utterly destroyed the construction projects painstakingly built in the years before the war. Moreover, our inherently weak country rose up to resist the war and struggled for eight years. Although it was fortunate enough to win, it was indeed exhausted. Our country was originally an agricultural nation. Since the Tang and Song Dynasties, scholars and officials have been accustomed to writing articles and competing for official careers. As for today's environment, although ideals have changed, the mentality and skills of most intellectuals still cannot adapt to the great era of scientific production. All constructions are waiting to be rebuilt, and the heart may be willing, but the strength is insufficient. After the victory of the War of Resistance, reconstruction became the top priority. The vitality had been damaged, and the people's strength had not recovered. Rest and recuperation were urgently needed. However, the Communist Party deliberately created chaos, benefiting the country's disintegration and social unrest, using the destruction of people's livelihood as a means and seizing political power as the goal, regarding the interests of its own party as higher than everything else, ignoring the country's survival, disregarding the people's suffering, plotting secretly, and using force to seize power by any means. This has made the current reconstruction work doubly difficult, and the glimmer of hope for recovery has been aggravated.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned may be inherent defects or unexpected man-made disasters. Our party, leading the revolution, has always tried to remedy its defects and overcome its difficulties in the midst of internal and external troubles. However, it has ultimately fallen short of its abilities, resulting in government measures that have not only failed to achieve significant results but have also frequently revealed shortcomings. These are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Principle of People's Livelihood is the fundamental guideline for nation-building, and its success depends on the implementation of industrial plans. If all economic policies can be based on principles and plans to solve the people's livelihood, they will surely be effective day by day, and eventually, they can achieve the goals of "making the best use of people's talents, making the best use of land, making the best use of things, and making the best use of goods", to achieve the goal of socialization. In the past, economic measures failed to effectively implement the principles of the People's Livelihood. This is the first point.</p>
<p>(2) Among the factors of production, labor always comes first. China has a large population, and human resources are its advantage. Past measures have neglected the development of human resources and the utilization of materials. There was no thorough plan for how to calculate materials, how to calculate human resources, and how to guide human resources to participate in production. It failed to create an economic foundation where production exceeds consumption. This is the second point.</p>
<p>(3) Governance should be based on credibility. In the past, economic, financial, and monetary measures were often hastily decided and changed frequently, which reduced the people's trust in the government. This is the third point.</p>
<p>(4) The focus of economic policy was unclear, the financial and monetary system was not established, state-owned and private enterprises were unevenly weighted, what should be retained and what should be discarded, which should be prioritized and which should be delayed. There was a lack of clear demarcation and firm decision-making. Domestic and foreign capital observed and remained isolated, and production and construction were affected. This is the fourth point.</p>
<p>(5) The people's wealth leads to sufficient finances; the people's poverty leads to financial exhaustion. Therefore, the solution to financial problems should start with increasing production and enriching the national economy to be effective. In the past, there was only the illusion of a balanced budget, but the actual budget could not be balanced, and currency had to be issued. Furthermore, it was mistakenly believed that funds truly used for production were also inflation, which failed to support production with the strength of the state, and the surplus capital of the people could not be led by government plans into the right path of production and construction. Instead, it concentrated in cities, becoming speculative hot money, engaging in speculation, and hindering production. This is the fifth point.</p>
<p>(6) Financial policies were divorced from the needs of the vast majority of people's lives and failed to closely cooperate with economic policies to support agriculture and industry and encourage production. Most policies focused on commerce, pursuing short-term profits, resulting in the pathological state of "neglecting agriculture, perfunctorily dealing with industry, and deteriorating commerce." This is the sixth point.</p>
<p>(7) Selling old gold was originally intended to contract the currency and stabilize prices, but it was misused, causing gold to lead prices upward, creating market chaos. This is the seventh point.</p>
<p>(8) There was a lack of long-term planning and overall plans, abandoning fundamentals and pursuing trivialities, responding to emergencies in a piecemeal fashion, resulting in the depletion of the inland economy and the concentration of funds in one corner, creating an unbalanced and unstable situation. This is the eighth point. The above is an honest review. How to solve the current difficulties and how to cultivate the foundation for the future must be addressed with the right medicine and effective countermeasures must be determined.</p>
<p>(B) Future Strategies</p>
<p>China has abundant human resources and vast land. As a victorious nation, it is undertaking reconstruction work. Judging from the current economic situation, the destruction and sabotage of the Communist Party is indeed an important reason for increasing difficulties, but the hardship should not be as severe as it is today. The problem lies in whether the government has appropriate policies to increase production and cultivate people's strength. If it can handle all economic problems according to the spirit of the People's Livelihood and its principles of socialization, it should not be difficult to obtain appropriate solutions. Although the Principle of People's Livelihood has the ideal of regulating capital, in the current stage, production and construction must first seek to have it. Private wealth leads to national wealth, and abundant production leads to sufficient wealth. Therefore, state capital should be the center, leading the activity of private capital, with state-owned enterprises taking on difficult tasks and assisting private enterprises in easy tasks. Regarding attracting foreign investment and encouraging private enterprises, how to solve their difficulties and how to protect their profits, the government should clearly decide to guide and encourage them. The government should especially make a great determination and show it with facts that all measures related to finance, economy, and currency should focus on the long-term interests of the country, be cautious at the beginning, and once decided and promulgated, should not be easily changed. Special attention should be paid to enforcing the rule of law, severely punishing corruption and dereliction of duty, and cracking down on manipulation and monopolies to protect the people's rights. In this way, the government's credibility can be consolidated, and future economic policies will not be difficult to implement to the fullest extent. The main points of the strategies are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Develop human resources and increase production. First, provide protection to existing production enterprises to stabilize employment and prevent unemployment. Second, gradually increase new production and construction projects with effective plans, guiding idle and unproductive human resources to participate in production. Third, encourage scientific inventions, promote labor service, to transform the social atmosphere and encourage the spirit of creating enterprises. Fourth, coordinate education with planned economy, so that the cultivation of talents and the construction of production are integrated.</p>
<p>(2) Increase the production of materials and stabilize prices. First, the government should issue agricultural production loans or adopt a fixed purchase method to promote the production of major agricultural raw materials such as rice, wheat, cotton, and beans, and utilize part or most of them. Second, the government must supply raw materials to manufacturers, or provide industrial production loans, or adopt a fixed purchase method to promote the production of flour, cloth, oil, sugar, fuel, and other daily necessities, and utilize part or most of them. Third, the government should issue export loans or adopt a fixed purchase method to promote the production and export of raw silk, sand, tung oil, wool, leather, tea leaves, and pig bristles to replenish foreign exchange reserves. Fourth, the government should first make planned supplies of daily necessities for the people's livelihood to officers, soldiers, public educators, and workers in production factories. In addition, surplus materials should be used to stabilize prices in urban areas so that hoarders cannot profit from scarcity, to achieve the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihood.</p>
<p>(3) Stabilize the currency value. First, quickly dispose of enterprises that do not need to be operated by the state, sell enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials, and consolidate tax revenues to make up for the financial shortfall in the short term and prevent currency inflation. Second, the government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the monetary system to gradually restore normalcy. Third, the monetary systems of Northeast China, Taiwan, and Xinjiang should be reorganized at the same time to make them consistent.</p>
<p>(4) Reform the financial system. The reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the country's economic policies, with increasing agricultural and industrial production as its main purpose. Financial institutions should have their own major specialized businesses to eliminate the phenomenon of general commercialization. Public and private banks must also be systematically distributed throughout the country to form a systematic financial network that is not concentrated in a few coastal cities, especially Shanghai. The methods are: First, the county should be the basic-level institution of the financial system, supporting the establishment of county banks to facilitate construction and cooperate with the promotion of local autonomy. County banks should follow the principle of one bank per county. In the initial stage, the county should hold 40% of the capital, and the central government 60%. When the work of county autonomy is gradually completed, the central government's capital should gradually decrease, eventually reaching a ratio of 70% for the local government and 30% for the central government. The central government should also provide specialized personnel to provide business guidance. Third, banks should be backed by the Farmers Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China, depending on the type and needs of their business. Fourth, land finance is a long-term issue. The government must designate special funds and issue land bonds to solve the problem. At an appropriate time, a special bank should be established to manage it. During the transition period, the Farmers Bank of China's land finance funds should be replenished, and business should be expanded through county banks. Fifth, the Farmers Bank of China should specialize in operating farmland water conservancy, agricultural product warehousing, transportation, processing, and land loans to facilitate farmers and support rural prosperity. Sixth, the Bank of Communications should specialize in operating industrial, mining, and transportation loans to develop industries. Seventh, the Bank of China should specialize in operating domestic and foreign trade loans and international remittance business (including overseas remittances). Eighth, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau should absorb people's savings deposits, handle small remittances, and cooperate with cooperative banks according to the principle of taking profits from the countryside and using them in the countryside to develop the rural economy. Ninth, the Central Cooperative Bank should specialize in operating cooperative loans for production and transportation, and supporting the organization and development of various cooperatives. Tenth, the Central Trust Bureau should specialize in trust insurance and be responsible for guiding the public's trust insurance and other businesses. Eleventh, the Central Bank, as the bank of banks, should have the main responsibility of regulating the country's finances, closely linking finance and economy, to complete economic construction. Twelfth, after the completion of reconstruction, the Four Joint Offices should be transformed into a design and liaison agency, or merged with the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance to establish a Financial Administration Bureau, subordinate to the Ministry of Finance, to unify authority. Thirteenth, the government should provide reasonable and effective guidance and control over provincial and municipal banks and ordinary banks. Fourteenth, each state bank should specialize according to its nature and be responsible for contacting and guiding the business of ordinary banks with the same nature. The scope and location of its branch offices should also be specified according to its business objects. (To be continued)</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the signing of the new Dutch-Indonesian treaty on the 26th: The Dutch government and the Indonesian Republic government signed an agreement on March 25th of this year, recognizing the de facto regime of the Indonesian Republic government in Java, Madura, and Sumatra, and stipulating the government's position in the future United States of Indonesia and the Dutch-Indonesian Federation. The Chinese government is very pleased to hear this. A new country will be born from this. The Chinese government and people have always sympathized with the efforts of nations that have not yet achieved autonomy to seek freedom and independence. The wisdom and statesmanship shown by the leaders of the Netherlands and Indonesia in this agreement are worthy of our praise. After this agreement is fully implemented, its impact will not only be limited to the parties involved. Future history will show us that this agreement will also have a major impact on the fate of other nations that have not yet achieved autonomy. During the Japanese occupation and the period of disputes between the Dutch authorities and the Indonesian people, Chinese in Indonesia have suffered great losses in life and property. We sincerely expect that the conclusion of this agreement will create a new era for Indonesia, so that all parties concerned will be responsible for guaranteeing the safety of these overseas Chinese and improving their welfare. For hundreds of years, Chinese in Indonesia have made great contributions to the development of Indonesia. I would now like to urge our 300,000 compatriots in Indonesia to continue and redouble their efforts to contribute to the prosperity of the new Indonesian Republic.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Welfare Meeting Approves Measures for Sending Back Refugees; Four Principles Determined for Work Relief Projects</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) and United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Social Welfare Work Conference yesterday reviewed the proposals of various subcommittee meetings in the morning and held a prescreening committee approval meeting. In the afternoon, subcommittee meetings discussed work relief projects and the repatriation of refugees and overseas Chinese. As a result, motions were put forward and passed at the plenary session held in the afternoon. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Work Relief Issues</p>
<p>(A) Regarding work relief issues: (A) Four principles were decided: (1) In the future, work relief methods should be used as much as possible to relieve unemployment; (2) Wages should be resolved through work relief; (3) The purpose of relief is not only to provide employment for the unemployed, but also to solve problems for refugees, and wages should be replaced with food, not because there is a shortage of food in the area, but to meet needs. (B) Two suggestions were made: (1) In the future, when using work relief methods, make as much use as possible of those who should accept work relief (referring to refugees), (2) Wages should be paid in kind or cash according to local needs.</p>
<p>Repatriation of Refugees</p>
<p>(B) Regarding the repatriation of refugees: Refugees currently in Asia are divided into five types: ordinary refugees, flood area refugees, overseas Chinese who wish to return to their original places of residence, overseas Chinese who wish to return to their homeland, and European refugees, totaling approximately 500,000. They are described separately as follows: (1) Ordinary refugees are distributed throughout China, especially in North China. In the future, after the work of CRRRA and UNRRA ends, due to various political reasons, the problem of domestic refugees will still exist. CRRRA cannot continue to be responsible, so it is proposed that the Ministry of Social Affairs cooperate with other relevant government agencies to develop in a planned manner. Due to the above reasons, the General Assembly passed a motion requesting CRRRA to cooperate with the Ministry of Social Affairs immediately to prepare for the handover in the future. (2) Flood area disaster victims: These refer to the disaster victims in the Yellow River flood area and the areas of northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanxi, especially the refugees in the Yellow River flood area, which are the most problematic, and some have been displaced for more than a year. Because the creation of the aforementioned disaster victims is related to political issues, negotiations have been conducted by CRRRA, the government, and the Chinese Communist Party, so the General Assembly did not discuss it further, but suggested that the relevant parties cooperate with CRRRA to solve this problem. (3) Overseas Chinese waiting to return to their country, UNRRA has gradually repatriated these refugees, but UNRRA must end by the end of July of this year, and this work must be completed. Therefore, the General Assembly passed a motion requesting CRRRA to jointly ask the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request the government to reconsider participating in the International Refugee Organization (the Chinese government had previously decided not to participate temporarily because the agency's funding was too large) in order to assist UNRRA in completing its work. If the government fails to participate, or the agency has not been completed when UNRRA ends (the International Refugee Agency is organized by the United Nations and has not yet been formally established), then please UNRRA continue to undertake it, or hand it over to CRRRA or other agencies to complete it. (4) Overseas Chinese who wish to return to their original places of residence, of these overseas Chinese, 15,000 wish to return to Burma and 6,000 wish to return to the Philippines, but they have not been able to do so due to various difficulties imposed by the governments of the Philippines and Burma. The General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue to negotiate with the above two governments, and UNRRA will also do its best to assist. (5) The repatriation of European refugees. The total number of European refugees is 16,000. UNRRA has repatriated 4,000, and 12,000 are still waiting to be repatriated. After UNRRA ends, it will become a problem. The General Assembly hopes that: (A) The Chinese government will join the International Refugee Organization to assist in the repatriation work and complete it, (B) The UNRRA Establishment Committee should conduct a thorough discussion.</p>

Then, the remains were moved to the cemetery. The procession escorting the remains stretched for more than a mile. The remains were placed in the burial chamber at 2:10 PM. The coffin was covered with the party and national flags. The burial site project was extremely magnificent. Dai was loyal to the party and the country during his lifetime, and now he is buried next to the revolutionary martyrs. The mountains and rivers compete for glory, and he can also rest in peace.</p>

<p>Shen Honglie Attends for the First Time to Provide Guidance</p>

Chairman Shen gave instructions on Hangzhou's municipal construction, indicating that both the internal and external aspects should be taken into account. (1) Psychological construction should start with improving the atmosphere as soon as possible. He vehemently criticized the corrupt atmosphere of monks and Taoists in Hangzhou, saying that monks and nuns dared to cohabitate openly and should be strictly rectified.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Review of the Pawnbroking Problem</h3>
<p>Reforming the financial system is one of the key points of the Economic Reform Plan of the Third Plenary Session. This issue is extremely broad in scope. Here, we intend to raise a relatively unnoticed but crucial issue, namely the pawnbroking problem, for everyone to explore.</p>
<p>Pawnbroking is an old-fashioned financial institution for the common people. Those who do not qualify to deal with banks and money shops can only rely on pawnbroking as a means of providing financing for emergencies. Now that cooperatives are gradually being promoted, credit cooperatives, while also undertaking deposit and lending tasks, only lend to members according to regulations. Their limits, collateral, procedures, etc., are also quite strict, which is not welcomed by ordinary people who are accustomed to convenience. Therefore, in the current stage of society, the pawnbroking system is undoubtedly still needed by the masses. Local social affairs agencies are currently promoting the public pawnbroking system. Article 25 of the Ministry-promulgated Pawnbroking Industry Regulations also stipulates incentive measures for legally operating pawnbrokers, which proves the importance of the pawnbroking position.</p>
<p>So, how should these pawnbrokers be improved? We believe that the first key point should be to reduce the interest rate and change high-interest loans to low-interest loans. Taking Shanghai as an example, pre-war pawnbroking was roughly divided into two types: (1) Mortgages, which had a larger scope, with interest rates of no more than 2%, and a term of up to eighteen months; (2) Pledges, which had a smaller scope, higher interest rates, and shorter terms. The high-interest loans commonly referred to as usurious exploitation refer to this type.</p>
<p>During the late period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, these high-interest loans had risen to as high as 5 jiao and 6.5 li, and the term was shortened to one month. After the victory, it was extended to two months. The monthly interest rate was still 5 jiao and 6.5 li for the first month, and 4 jiao and 3.65 li for the second month. Because the handling fee of 0.15% was usually collected in advance together with the first month, and had to be added to the principal, the interest was compounded. Later, after repeated supervision by the local competent authorities to reduce the interest rate, and after some members of the Municipal Council proposed urging this, it was only finalized after several months. It was implemented from January of this year, and the term is still two months, with a uniform monthly interest rate reduced to 3 jiao and 6 fen, including a monthly interest rate of 2 jiao and 5 fen, a warehouse rent of 4 fen, and a handling fee of 7 fen. This handling fee is not included in the principal.</p>
<p>When the interbank lending rate in the industrial and commercial sectors reached around 2 jiao, everyone already felt that the burden was too heavy and collectively requested relief. The government and financial authorities also felt that it was inappropriate to sit idly by, and actively undertook various low-interest loans to provide relief. However, the general public still has to pay high-interest loans of 3 jiao and 6 fen per month, which is certainly a very unreasonable thing. It is heard that the municipal government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to further supervise the reduction of pawnbroking interest rates. The Pawnbroking Industry Management Regulations also stipulate that the warehouse rent fee is only allowed to be charged at 0.2% per month, and the insurance fee is also 0.2%, and all other irregular fees are strictly prohibited. As for the pawnbroking interest rates charged, the local trade associations are responsible for drafting them themselves, submitting them to the competent authorities for approval, and reporting them to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. The supervision is quite strict. For the sake of the welfare of the general public, we naturally hope that it will be realized soon.</p>
<p>The question is, to what extent can the pawnbroking interest rate actually be reduced in practice? This is a matter of fact, not something that can be solved by empty words. Because the boundaries between mortgages and pledges have long been eliminated. Their capital is usually only a few million yuan. Of the more than 700 pawnbrokers in the city, it is said that only one-tenth have dealings with banks and money shops. The remaining working capital is nothing more than borrowing and absorbing deposits, and the monthly interest rate often has to be as high as around 2 jiao. Coupled with all the expenses, taxes, profits, etc., in order to barely maintain and avoid losses, their request for a pawnbroking interest rate of 3 jiao and 6 fen is certainly reasonable to some extent.</p>
<p>Therefore, to improve the people's finance and reduce their burden, the most important thing is to raise funds for them and reduce the interest rate on their loans. Because, according to their own calculations, this pawnbroking interest rate of 3 jiao and 6 fen includes a borrowing interest rate of 2 jiao and 5 fen, a warehouse rent of 4 fen, and a handling fee of 7 fen. If the borrowing interest rate can be reduced by some means, then the pawnbroking interest rate can naturally be reduced proportionally. For example, the municipal public pawnbroker only charges an interest rate of 2 fen, and the term is as long as six months. However, it is a public welfare nature, not a profit-making nature. On the one hand, it can subsidize expenses, and on the other hand, it obtains low-interest overdrafts from the Municipal Bank, so it can support itself. Commercial pawnbrokers, however, are profit-making in nature, and of course it is not appropriate to force them to lose money. Therefore, providing low-interest financing is the only effective way to reduce pawnbroking interest rates and benefit the people.</p>
<p>So, from where should these low-interest funds be provided? The City Council has passed a resolution urging the Municipal Bank to take on this responsibility. The Municipal Bank is a bank owned by the city, and it should naturally take on this responsibility for the welfare of the citizens. Even if there are surplus state-owned banks and money shops, after undertaking low-interest loans for industry and commerce, we also hope that they will share some of the profits and allow the general public to get some benefits. There are currently only more than 700 pawnbrokers in the city. If half of them apply for overdrafts, with an overdraft amount of 10 million yuan per household, the total amount would only be more than 3.5 billion yuan, which is not even as much as the loan amount of a large company. Moreover, the overdraft of the pawnbroking industry is gradually withdrawn on a daily basis, which is different from the general commercial firms that take the entire batch to buy goods. Therefore, the burden on the banking side does not seem to be severe. The problem is that the pawnbroking industry originally belongs to small-scale operations and cannot come up with reliable collateral, and it is not easy to find commercial firms to act as guarantors. All the goods in stock have to be sold to the suppliers when they are due, which is not convenient for assigning as collateral. All the account books are also mostly old-fashioned, and it is also felt to be very inconvenient during the audit. The bank may consider these conditions to be too unsuitable. However, these conditions are ultimately technical problems and do not seem difficult to overcome. For example, group joint guarantees, sharing the responsibility of repayment, also seems to be a way.</p>
<p>The main purpose of our raising this issue is, of course, to facilitate the people and reduce their burden. Once the people's finance is loosened, it will also affect the general interest rate and ease the momentum of high-interest loans. In the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, there are also the following sentences: "The goal of the Principle of the People's Livelihood is to improve the living standards of the majority of the people and enable the people of the whole country to enjoy an adequate livelihood. Therefore, all economic policies of the government must be targeted at the majority of the people." The so-called majority of the people naturally refers to the general public. They are currently groaning under high-interest loans. Leaving aside how their living standards should be improved, the pain they suffer from the exploitation of heavy interest is undoubtedly something that should be relieved. Otherwise, "financial policy is divorced from the living needs of the vast majority of the people" would not be the main theme of the Third Plenary Session's Economic Reform Plan.</p>

<h3>Peace Conference with Germany Should Be Convened by the Five Great Powers; Marshall Makes a Suggestion; All German People Have the Obligation to Fulfill the Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Moscow, 26th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall made a suggestion to the Council of Foreign Ministers today that the four major powers plus China invite all the Allied countries that previously "fought against Germany" to hold a peace conference on the German issue before the final draft of the peace treaty with Germany is completed. Marshall proposed to the Council of Foreign Ministers that such countries be invited to participate in the conference as soon as the preparatory work has "made sufficient progress," and that all countries be given the opportunity to freely express their opinions on the German issue. He also suggested that "responsible representatives of Germany should also be given the opportunity to present their views at the conference." He said that the four major powers would draft the text of the peace treaty with Germany based on the recommendations passed by a two-thirds majority vote at the conference, and then submit the finally drafted treaty text to the countries that previously fought against Germany for signature.</p>
<p>Marshall also suggested that the German Constitution should include a clause "expressly stipulating that all powers in the Constitution should be followed and implemented in accordance with the peace treaty." If so, "then in addition to adopting the Constitution, this clause would often make the German people have the obligation to accept the peace treaty, and all German people should have the obligation to fulfill the peace treaty."</p>
<p>The Council of Foreign Ministers did not reach a general agreement on Marshall's suggestion. Bevin and Bidault both supported China as one of the signatory countries of the peace treaty with Germany. Molotov has agreed to consider this opinion. Bidault agreed with Marshall's constitutional clause suggestion, but Bevin expressed doubts about whether this move was legal. He also did not express support for convening a peace conference with Germany as soon as possible. Molotov believed that the peace treaty with Germany should be signed by a German government, otherwise the strength of the treaty would inevitably be weakened. Molotov agreed to allow German representatives to attend the peace conference with Germany to provide opinions, but Bidault firmly opposed it.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: The US Secretary of State recently categorically denied the Soviet Union's accusation that Britain and the United States had enriched themselves by obtaining 10 billion yuan in German reparations. Marshall presented official documents to the Council of Foreign Ministers, proving that the total amount of reparations that the United States had obtained was less than 275 million yuan. According to reports, a week ago, Molotov accused Britain and the United States of opposing the Soviet Union's demand for 10 billion yuan in reparations, while they themselves had obtained more than 10 billion yuan.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Moscow, 25th Dispatch] The four foreign ministers also discussed the issue of Albania's participation in the Advisory Committee and the Intelligence Committee at today's meeting. France and the Soviet Union still advocated that Albania should participate in these committees, while Britain and the United States still expressed their objections. The Soviet representative emphasized that Albania has the right to obtain German reparations. The US representative proposed that countries such as Iraq and South America, which had declared war on Germany but did not actually fight, should also participate in these committees. The four foreign ministers did not reach an agreement on this issue and then accepted Foreign Minister Bidault's suggestion to return it to the four foreign ministers' meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has notified the Italian government that the Soviet government supports Italian representatives attending the Council of Foreign Ministers to explain their opinions on the peace treaty with Germany. According to well-informed sources, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza expressed his satisfaction after receiving the note from Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, but has not yet decided on the manner in which Italy should participate in the Council of Foreign Ministers.</p>
<h3>Key Clauses of the German Peace Treaty: US and Soviet Union to Make Concessions, US Considers Reducing Occupation Troops in Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 26th] According to reliable sources, the United States and the Soviet Union appear to be willing to make significant concessions regarding the key clauses of the German peace treaty. However, officials are uncertain whether these concessions will be substantial enough for the current Foreign Ministers' conference to reach an agreement on major disputes. It is reported that the US is considering allowing the Soviet Union to extract substantial reparations from Germany's current industrial production for several years, provided that it does not increase the tax burden on American citizens. Western diplomats believe that continuing to receive reparations is the Soviet Union's primary objective. If their desire can be adequately satisfied in this regard, they will likely be willing to modify their other demands. There are currently no specific indications of possible Soviet concessions. However, British Foreign Secretary Bevin expressed considerable optimism about the situation after a private meeting with Soviet Premier Stalin yesterday, which is quite significant.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] It is understood that the US delegation to the Foreign Ministers' conference will submit a formal resolution instructing the Berlin Allied Control Council to reduce the number of occupation troops in the four sectors. The intention is to reduce the consumption of local resources by the occupation troops, allowing Germany to have more goods available for export and to achieve self-sufficiency as soon as possible. The US suggests that the Allied Control Council determine how many occupation troops are needed to maintain the security of the four sectors for one year, starting from July 1, 1947. The Allied Control Council should submit an investigation report to the current Foreign Ministers' conference by June 1st. In addition, Marshall will present a memorandum on German democratization and German industry at today's meeting. The memorandum on German industry clearly states that investments in any German war industry cannot expect to yield returns, while only investments in German peaceful industries can be rewarded. The submission of this memorandum is intended to respond to criticism of American capitalist investment in Germany.</p>
<h3>US Definition of Democracy Under Close Scrutiny in Moscow</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow Airmail] US Secretary of State Marshall gave a definition of the American concept of democracy at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, causing this ancient Greek word to be closely examined in Moscow. Some advocate that the Soviet Union should also provide a definition, believing that the key to making peace lies in being able to accept a definition. If a Soviet citizen and an American citizen, such as the key figures of Marshall and Molotov in the Foreign Ministers Conference, lived in the same room and discussed democracy, it could be discovered that although they spoke the same language, what they were talking about might be completely different. According to Marshall, a society where law-abiding citizens are denied the right to work or have their lives, liberty, and happiness deprived is not considered free. Marshall also strongly advocated for freedom of elections, freedom of labor unions, freedom of the press, radio, film, theater, and music, and civic freedom, considering them extremely important in the American concept of a democratic society. For two consecutive days, Soviet newspapers mildly attacked Marshall's definition, citing the situation in Greece and the status of African Americans to demonstrate the shortcomings of the American way of practicing democracy.</p>

<h3>Significant Progress Made in Discussions on Austrian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 25th] The progress made in today's discussions on the Austrian issue at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference was greater than in previous meetings. A drafting committee has been formed to finalize the form of the peace treaty so that it can be submitted to the four powers for discussion on Saturday. It was also agreed to discuss difficult economic clauses tomorrow, and the Soviet Union has agreed to submit its proposals regarding the refugees in Austria. According to Gusev of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's proposal on this issue is divided into two parts: one concerns the withdrawal of Germans from Austria, and the second concerns the complete withdrawal of its refugees within six months after the implementation of the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 25th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers met today to discuss the Austrian peace treaty and immediately decided to establish a four-power expert committee, with one member from each country, to draft a report on the military clauses of the Austrian peace treaty for submission to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference for discussion. In addition, the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers have completed drafting a report on economic issues.</p>
<h3>Security Council Vetoes British-Albanian Dispute, Soviet Union Exercises Veto Power, Britain Plans to Submit Case to International Court</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] The Soviet Union suddenly exercised its veto power today when the United Nations Security Council voted by a majority to support Britain's accusation against Albania for laying mines. This is the first time the council has used its veto power since September 20 last year when the Soviet Union overturned the US's initial proposal to conduct an on-site investigation of the Balkan situation. The amended resolution proposed by Britain demanded recognition that laying mines in peacetime without notifying other countries is "inhumane" and that Albania had prior knowledge of the mines. During the voting, the case was passed by a vote of seven to two, with Australia abstaining and Britain unable to vote due to its status as the plaintiff. The opposing votes came from the Soviet Union and Poland. However, with the Soviet Union having exercised its veto power, the Albanian incident is likely to be shelved in the Security Council. According to British sources, Britain is now planning to propose that the case be transferred to the International Court of Justice for handling.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Infighting Erupts During Greek Independence Day Celebrations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 25th] Guerrilla infighting erupted in the Lidochki region today as the Greek people celebrated their 126th Independence Day.

Athens celebrated Independence Day today with a twenty-one-gun salute, national flags flying everywhere, military bands marching through the streets, King George II inspecting the troops, and Archbishop Damaskinos delivering a speech, calling on the people to unite and safeguard national interests and beliefs.</p>
<h3>Trusteeship Council Formally Inaugurated, US and Soviet Union Brewing New Differences, Lie Delivers Important Political Speech</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] At the opening of the United Nations Trusteeship Council, UN Secretary-General Lie delivered a speech with very solemn wording. In addition to implicitly referring to the US aid plan for Greece and Turkey as hindering the UN's position, he stated that the UN will "soon" discuss the Palestinian issue. He revealed that the US will explain its anti-communist policy of aiding Greece and Turkey when the Security Council convenes on Friday, and the Soviet Union may also take the opportunity to formally criticize the US's motives for the first time. After briefly outlining the organization of the Trusteeship Council, Lie stated, "New Guinea, Ruanda-Urundi, Tanganyika, French Cameroon, Western Samoa, British Togoland and Cameroon are all now under the Trusteeship System. Certain League of Nations Mandated Territories such as Nauru, Southwest Africa, Palestine, and the Former Japanese Mandated Islands in the Pacific, have not yet been placed under the Trusteeship System."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations is preparing to cope with new differences between the United States and the Soviet Union again today, and it is possible that the Soviet Union will make its first formal criticism of the United States' aid program for Greece and Turkey. The Soviet Union's attention is drawn for many reasons, due to the fact that the United States has long been preparing for the following major developments. First, the United States is preparing to explain to the Security Council why it provides $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey as a means of preventing communism, without notifying the United Nations. Second, when United Nations Secretary-General Lie establishes the Trusteeship Council, he plans to deliver an opening speech criticizing the United States' obstructive actions towards the United Nations. Third, until the last moment, the Soviet Union still makes other members of the United Nations uncertain whether it will participate in the Trusteeship Council, one of the major organs of the world organization. Lie, heeding the advice of some of his assistants, plans to speak in moderate terms when the Trusteeship Committee meets, and in advance he will largely publicize his opening speech as an "important political speech." According to sources close to the United Nations, Lie's original plan to use the US policy toward Greece and Turkey as the theme of his speech has been replaced by indirect remarks. However, United Nations Secretary-General Lie has not completely abandoned his established position, that is, emphasizing that the United Nations will have no hope of success unless all its member states submit all international problems to it for resolution. The Soviet Union is the only one of the ten countries on the Trusteeship Council that has not pre-designated its representative. It will open its United Nations to the world, promising to bring a new plan to nearly 25.9 million un-independent people. The Soviet Union's refusal to participate will undoubtedly severely harm the United Nations' overly ambitious trusteeship plan.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission Meeting Ends Without Result</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 26th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission held a closed meeting on the 25th to draft a detailed plan to control atomic energy, but disputes immediately arose when discussing how to proceed. The United States believes that various countries have been subjected to some interference from within and demanded that the commission begin drafting an agreement to stipulate the powers of the international control organization. Soviet representative Gromyko objected, insisting that his thirteen amendments to the "Baruch Plan" should be discussed first. Gromyko's amendments advocate restricting the powers of international regulatory agencies and reserving the veto power for the five powers on the matter of punishing violations. Syria supported the Soviet Union's position, while Australia supported the US view. After three hours of heated debate, the original Energy Commission adjourned and scheduled to meet again on the 30th of this month. [Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 25th] The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to meet on the 28th of this month to discuss the issue of placing the islands formerly mandated to Japan in the Pacific Ocean under the sole trusteeship of the United States.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Bevin Considering Resignation to Take Charge of Economic Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 26th] "The News Chronicle" reported today that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is seriously considering resigning. If the resignation is realized, Prime Minister Attlee will likely ask Bevin to personally lead the government's economic recovery plan. At that time, Bevin will become the director of the economic plan, and his work will ensure that the plan is strictly implemented, regardless of any obstacles from labor and management. Bevin was the person who mobilized the country after the Dunkirk defeat, and there is no doubt that he has a plan in mind for the huge task of mobilizing in peacetime. The most likely successor to the Foreign Secretary is Finance Minister Dalton, and the vacancy of the Finance Minister will be filled by Commercial Minister Cripps.</p>
<p>[United Press International, London, 25th] It is widely rumored here today that the Attlee Labor Cabinet, facing a worsening economic crisis, is prepared to dissolve Parliament and order a re-election. This statement is mostly seen in conservative newspapers and has been denied by officials.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Speaks, Says US Should Maintain Strength</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] US Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower said in a speech at the National Press Club today that no country dares to wantonly launch a world war at present, but this does not mean that war cannot break out. For example, the Venice Giulia incident occurred when drafting the Italian peace treaty, and this fact is enough to cause war. Therefore, you should support the United States in maintaining its current military strength.</p>
<h3>Comparison of US and Soviet Air Force Strengths</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 25th] This question is often researched, and as a result of official and non-official records, it is known that the Soviet Union currently has more military aircraft than the Heavenly Kingdom. A comparison of the air forces of the United States and the Soviet Union is as follows: The Soviet Union has 16,000 aircraft of all types, most of which are fighter planes. The United States has 13,000 aircraft for combat, of which more than 5,000 belong to the Army Air Corps, and 3,000 are Navy or Marine Corps aircraft, carried on aircraft carriers or based on land. The strength of the Soviet Navy is still weak, and its naval air force only occupies an unimportant position. The above figures do not include reserve air forces. Although the preparedness of all reserve aircraft in the United States varies, the number is similar to that of regular air force fleets. The number of Soviet reserve air force is unknown. As for aircraft production, there is no way to compare due to the lack of information on the Soviet Union's current production capacity and goals. However, according to air force strategists, the Soviet Union has abandoned its plan to build a strong navy except for submarines, so it can transfer shipbuilding materials and manpower to aircraft production. This factor is very important and should be paid attention to.</p>

<h3>US Ambassador to Warsaw Resigns, Resignation Approved</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 25th] The White House announced that US Ambassador to Poland Lane submitted his resignation, which has been approved by President Truman. The Polish government's disregard for its international obligations is the reason why Ambassador Lane resigned. The resignation reads: "I have tried my best to advise the Polish government to abide by the provisions stipulated in the Yalta Agreement, but the Polish general election is still not free, and the general election is made nominal with terror, violence, and threats. The Polish government's disregard for its international obligations can be seen from this. Under these circumstances, I am unable to promote US-Polish relations, so I request resignation."</p>
<h3>US Congressman Demands Recall of MacArthur for One Month</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 25th] Republican Congressman Van Zandt introduced a bill in the House of Representatives today, requesting President Truman to recall MacArthur for at least one month to discuss the Far East situation at a joint session of the House and Senate. According to Van Zandt, MacArthur's opinions on issues such as "national security, foreign forces infiltrating, and moral decline" have the effect of stabilizing the American people.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 26th] Regarding the previous report that Washington will summon the military commander back to the country for consultations, sources familiar with the matter said today that the Allied Headquarters has not yet received this information and said that President Truman would not make this request.

<h3>The "Hai Min" Ship Arrives in Shanghai After Repairing Damage</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Hai Min" ship, which collided with the naval gunboat "Fu Bo" near Xiamen, causing the gunboat to sink, arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. It is now docked near the Santai Wharf in Dongjiadu. The "Hai Min" ship only had its bow water tank damaged, which was repaired in Xiamen. More than ten representatives from the First Naval Base Command in Shanghai, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Ministry of Transportation, and nautical experts boarded the ship after it docked. They summoned the captain and passenger representatives to investigate the incident. Our reporter also boarded the ship to interview Captain Dai Rulin, passenger Zheng Guiren, and Lieutenant Jiao Dexiao, the only surviving engineer from the "Fu Bo" gunboat.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Jiao is physically strong, but still appears exhausted. He floated in the water for four hours before being rescued. He recounted the incident as follows: On the night of the 18th and 19th, he heard a loud crash in his sleep. At first, he thought the ship had hit a reef. He quickly grabbed his life jacket, opened his cabin door, and ran to the deck. He saw the stern of the ship beginning to sink.</p>
<p>All Officers and Soldiers Tragically Drowned</p>
<p>At that time, all the officers and soldiers of the ship had gathered on the deck. The captain was signaling the "Hai Min" ship for help while starting to lower the lifeboats. The ship continued to sink rapidly. The stern was completely submerged within a minute, and the bow sank even faster. In an instant, the water was near the top of the ship. He tried to walk out from the bridge and jump into the sea, but the water had already covered the top. Fortunately, he was a skilled swimmer and struggled for a minute before floating to the surface. However, he had already swallowed two mouthfuls of water. The wind and waves were very strong, and there were many other officers and soldiers floating on the sea, calling for help. After about half an hour, the "Hai Min" ship shone a searchlight, but it was far away and did not immediately come to rescue them. He only saw it slowly moving, and it was unclear if it was trying to approach and rescue them. What was certain was that the ship did not move far away after that. After another half hour, a buoy floated next to him. This buoy was truly his savior. At that time, other officers and soldiers floating on the sea had succumbed to exhaustion and drowned. Finally, the "Hai Min" ship spotted him holding onto the buoy, and he was lucky to be the only survivor of the tragedy. The "Fu Bo" gunboat carried more than 160 officers and soldiers, including 20 cadets. These cadets were recently admitted high school graduates around the age of twenty. Their studies were not completed, and their lives were lost, which is truly unfortunate.</p>
<p>Passengers Expressed Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The reporter then met with passenger Zheng Guiren, an employee of the Shanghai Materials Office of the Ministry of Transportation. He strongly criticized the "Hai Min" ship captain for his dereliction of duty. He claimed that the "Fu Bo" gunboat was clearly visible obstructing the path before the collision, even in the middle of the night, but the captain refused to stop the ship. After the collision, Zheng went to the bow and saw the warship being hit and tilting upwards, slowly sinking. However, the "Hai Min" ship did not immediately stop to rescue them, but continued to move forward and flee. When passengers asked why they were not rescuing them, they were told to mind their own business. It was not until 2:00 AM that they returned to the scene of the accident. They saw two or three people floating in the water calling for help, but the captain still refused to rescue them immediately, delaying the opportunity and only rescuing Jiao Dexiao. He concluded by saying that all the passengers on the ship were very dissatisfied with the captain. Moreover, the "Hai Min" ship could have arrived in Shanghai the day before, but it went off course when it was 120 degrees away from Shanghai, causing it to arrive only yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Captain's Written Report</p>
<p>Captain Dai Rulin looked dejected. When he met the reporter, he stammered and only showed the written report he submitted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which stated: "The 'Hai Min' ship was en route from Xiamen to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 18th. At 0:07 AM on the 19th, while passing the Ocksen Light Honse lighthouse at a true bearing of 58 degrees, we saw a ship's mast light and green sidelight at 40 degrees on the port side of our ship. At the time, our ship believed that the other ship was showing a green light and sailing from northwest to southeast. According to the maritime collision avoidance regulations, our ship had no responsibility to avoid the route. Therefore, we maintained our original course. At 0:12 AM, we saw that the other ship had not avoided the route and was getting closer. Therefore, our ship immediately sounded one whistle and steered hard to starboard while reversing the engine. Because the other ship still came head-on, it collided with the bow of our ship at 0:15 AM. The other ship was severely damaged and sank within minutes. Our ship immediately stopped and patrolled the area, making every effort to rescue them until 4:20 AM, rescuing the other ship's engineer, Jiao Dexiao. Our ship continued to search until 12:00 PM on the 19th. Because we felt that there was no discovery of any people or objects floating on the water in the surrounding area, and the water tank in the bow of our ship was broken, with water reaching over 17 feet, we decided to sail near Xiamen for temporary repairs for the safety of our ship. According to Jiao Dexiao, the rescued engineer of the other ship, the other ship was the Chinese Navy gunboat 'Fu Bo', sailing from Fuzhou to Taiwan shoal."</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Fuel Control Committee Discusses Coal Allocation Procedures: Coal for Factories and Civilian Use Was Reviewed by the Committee; No Response Planned Regarding Cases Reported in the Press</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Control Committee (FCC), met with a reporter from this newspaper yesterday to explain the FCC's coal allocation procedures. He stated that the FCC prioritizes coal allocation in five areas: (1) Railways. (2) Public utilities, in the following order: (a) Beijing and Shanghai, (b) the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou line, (c) Hankou, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo. (3) Ships, in the following order: (a) military and government, (b) commercial vessels. (4) Factories, (a) state-owned, (b) private. (5) Civilian coal use, allocated by the Coal Industry Association. The FCC has never interrupted the main coal allocations for the first three items under any circumstances. However, in the past two months, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, the Qinhuangdao port was frozen for over a month and a half, riots occurred in Taiwan, and the original Zichuan and Boyou mines in Qingdao were lost. Therefore, coal allocation in February and March relied on the FCC's reserves. He stated that the main reason for the establishment of the FCC was the shortage and uneven distribution of coal. Because of the reduced coal supply in the past two months, and the inability to reduce coal allocation for the first three priority items, the coal allocation for items four and five had to be reduced.</p>
<p>Association Responsible for Transportation and Investigation</p>
<p>Regarding the method of coal allocation, except for the first three main items which are directly allocated by the FCC, the FCC staff has never had direct contact with factories in the other coal allocation principles. The allocation method is that each coal-consuming industry association compiles the quantity requested by each factory, which is first reviewed and approved by each association and then sent to the FCC. The FCC then approves the allocated quantity based on the monthly coal supply. After approval, the quantity and price are notified to each association and the Coal Industry Association, which is responsible for transportation and for investigating and reporting on two points: (1) Whether the factory is using coal, and (2) Whether the factory is operating. If anything is not in compliance, the FCC will immediately stop the allocation upon notification from the Coal Industry Association. The cases reported in the press have not been finalized, and there are official documents to prove it, so the FCC does not intend to respond. However, the FCC is constantly striving to improve the procedures for coal allocation, and hopes that the Coal Industry Association will continue to assist with the coal allocation inspection responsibilities and provide guidance.</p>
<p>Increased Coal Supply Expected Next Month</p>
<p>He also stated that the coal supply in January was 110,000 tons, 70,000 tons in February, and 120,000 tons this month. However, the coal allocation for the first three priority items alone requires 180,000 tons per month. The coal supply in April is expected to improve, as Huludao in Northeast China has thawed, and it is estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 tons can be supplied each month. Order has also been restored in Taiwan, and a small amount of coal can be exported. Therefore, it is hoped that in the next month, some coal can be allocated to private factories and civilian use, and the allocation method will continue to be improved.</p>
<h3>Detailed Account of Central Bank Employees Purchasing Gold: 46 Employees in Total, the Largest Purchase Was 300 Taels</h3>
<p>Regarding the purchase of gold by employees of the Central Bank during the gold rush, it is understood that after the gold rush incident, the Shanghai Economic Inspection Team confiscated the account books of the five gold shops that were allocated gold by the Central Bank. Among them, in the account book of Taikang Runjin Gold Shop, it was discovered that gold was purchased on behalf of Central Bank employees under the name of Wang Li, a total of ten times, totaling 97 bars. The bank's audit department reported this and summoned the manager of Taikang Runjin Gold Shop. It was found that Wang Li was an employee of Taikang Runjin, who was usually assigned to handle gold collection and payment at the Central Bank. Central Bank employees occasionally entrusted her to buy gold on their behalf. Because Wang Li handled the transactions, the account was listed under the name of Wang Li. The introduction was mostly done by Wang Yuanqing and Liu Maodi, deputy directors of the Cashier Department of the Central Bank's Business Bureau. Later, it was discovered that Wang Songtao, an agent of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, had purchased two gold bars in the account book of Tongfengyu. The quantity of gold purchased by other employees was listed separately by Taikang Runjin Gold Shop and the handlers, but most of them were small amounts of one or two taels and three or five taels. The largest purchase was 30 bars purchased by Huang Dafu, a clerk in the Business Bureau, on behalf of his relatives and friends. After verification, it was confirmed to be true. After the free purchase and sale of gold, the purchase of gold by Central Bank employees was no different from that of ordinary people and did not violate the law. However, because the bank had previously issued a notice stating that employees should not handle funds on behalf of others during office hours, Wang Songtao, Wang Yuanqing, Liu Maodi, Huang Dafu and other four people were deemed to have violated the bank's rules and were dismissed. Other employees were given warnings or demerits because the amounts were very small and were considered savings. Outsiders expressed admiration for President Zhang's determination to rectify the bank's discipline. However, most employees sympathized and regretted that Wang Songtao, Wang Yuanqing, and others had been serving the bank for many years, were known for their diligence, and had received severe punishment for purchasing gold on behalf of others.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the names and amounts of gold purchased by the bank's colleagues are as follows:</p>

<p>Hu Yaozong (self) 10 taels, Cai Yanzhi (self) 20 taels</p>

<h3>Compensation for Wartime Losses to the People Has Been Handed Over to the Compensation Committee for Review; Reply from the Executive Yuan to the Senate's Proposal</h3>
<p>The City Council's second general meeting resolved that the government should allocate enemy and puppet materials to compensate for the wartime property losses of the people, and that the government should advance funds to make up for any shortfall. The Council received a reply from the Executive Yuan through the City Government yesterday, stating: "The enemy property materials received, except for those returned to the original owners, should be sold by tender to increase revenue. The property materials received from the puppet government should not be used to compensate for wartime losses. The Executive Yuan has established a Compensation Committee to handle the investigation of war losses and claims against Japan. The part of this case concerning compensation for wartime losses to the people has been handed over to the Committee for review."</p>

<h3>First Person Executed for Drug Offenses: Xu Guanghe Executed by Firing Squad; Taken to the Execution Ground Yesterday Morning and Died with One Shot</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Local Court executed a drug offender named Xu Guanghe by firing squad at 9:00 AM yesterday. This is the first person to be executed for drug offenses in Shanghai since the victory.</p>
<p>On May 29 last year, the City Police Department cracked down on a drug den in Caishi Street, seized eight bags of heroin, and arrested five drug offenders, including Xu Guanghe, Ji Shenghua, Zhang Agen, Li Erdou, and Han Zhengxiang, who were sent to the Local Court for trial. Initially, Judge Shen Tianbao sentenced them to 12 years in prison. Xu Guanghe and the other four appealed to the High Court. After deliberation, the High Court ruled that Xu Guanghe was selling drugs and changed the sentence to death in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium and Drug Prohibition. The sentences of the other three offenders, Ji Shenghua and others, were changed to three years in prison in accordance with Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the same regulations. The death sentence of Xu Guanghe was approved by the Ministry of Justice. On the 20th of this month, the Shanghai High Court received Execution Order No. 6452 from Beijing and ordered the Local Procuratorate to carry out the execution.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Prosecutor Fu Bang of the Criminal Execution Office of the Local Procuratorate, accompanied by bailiffs Huang Rongchang, Deputy Police Chief, and Squad Leader Xu Doulin, went to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison to retrieve Xu Guanghe. Prosecutor Fu verified his identity and informed him that he was ordered to be executed and asked if he had any last words. Xu changed his expression upon hearing that he was to be executed and replied: "I am a Shanghai native, 23 years old this year. My father, Xu Fushou, and my brother, Xu Guangliang, are at home. Please notify them to collect the body. I have nothing else to say." He was immediately escorted to the execution ground, where Deputy Squad Leader Wang Xingran executed him with one shot.

<h3>Hongqiao Airport Will Become an International Civil Aviation Station; The Proposal to Build an Educational Zone Was Not Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the proposal to use Hongqiao Airport to build a secondary education zone in Shanghai, named the Zhongzheng Cultural Zone, to commemorate the Chairman's 60th birthday, the City Council's first general meeting and the Council's Education Committee repeatedly passed resolutions urging the City Government to actively acquire land and begin construction. It is learned that the City Government has received a response from the Executive Yuan stating that it could not be approved. The Executive Yuan replied to the City Council, stating: According to the Ministry of Transportation, Shanghai has only two civil aviation airports, Longhua and Hongqiao. With the increasing development of civil aviation, Longhua Airport is insufficient to meet the needs of the Shanghai area. In addition, Hongqiao Airport is unobstructed on all sides, and all relevant parties believe that it is most suitable for use as an international civil aviation station. The Ministry of Transportation is currently planning to build it into an international civil aviation airport, and the Civil Aviation Administration will begin construction this year. There are four airports in Shanghai. Jiangwan and Dachang are for military use, Longhua is designated for civil use, and Hongqiao Airport is currently largely abandoned. The area covers 2,513 mu, of which 267 mu were requisitioned by the Shanghai County Government by order of the Provincial Government in 1921 to be used as an airport. 890 mu were requisitioned by the Shanghai Municipal Government in 1934 to expand the airport. Another 1,256 mu were occupied by the enemy army during the occupation and have not been formally requisitioned. Since the City Council decided to build a secondary education zone there, dozens of private secondary schools have requested to the Education Bureau to participate in the construction of school buildings in the zone. The high expectations of all parties can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Chen Bofan's Escape Case: Guarantors Re-examined; Deny Facilitating Escape; Defense Lawyers Number Twelve</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The traitor Chen Bofan once served as a member of the puppet Central Executive Committee, director of the puppet Central Political Committee's Foreign Affairs Special Committee, and deputy director of the puppet Daily Necessities Control Association. He was previously sentenced by the High Court to one year and three months of imprisonment and has already been released after serving his sentence. When his sentence expired, the Chief Prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office ordered Chen to find two reputable business guarantors. Merchants Zhang Benda and Kong Runjiu provided bail to release Chen. Subsequently, the High Court discovered new evidence of Chen Bofan's crime in the case, and in February dispatched two bailiffs to Zhang Benda's residence to arrest Chen Bofan. Unexpectedly, Zhang delayed the bailiffs while notifying Chen's family. Chen's mother, Chen Songshi, his younger brother Chen Nairong, his uncle Chen Kang, and his girlfriend Shen Qi, among others, devised a plan to hide Chen. Chen Kang drove Chen away from Liu's residence at 18 Yongkang Road, and Chen Bofan disappeared without a trace. After the incident, the High Prosecutor's Office immediately launched an investigation. The results confirmed that Zhang Benda, Kong Runjiu, Dong Nai, Dong Weishi, Shen Qi, and the fugitive Chen Kang were suspected of violating Article 6 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, which prohibits concealing and facilitating the escape of traitors. Therefore, they were prosecuted according to the law. Yesterday morning, the High Court re-interrogated the five defendants, Zhang Benda, etc. The defendants hired as many as twelve lawyers, including Zhang Shiliu. The lawyers' seats were fully occupied. The defendants all denied having facilitated Chen Bofan's escape. The court hearing lasted for a long time, and the case was adjourned for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Strange Phenomenon in the Book Industry: New National Standard Textbooks Not Being Printed; Old Approved Textbooks Being Printed in Competition</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education previously announced that the copyright for national standard textbooks would be opened and implemented in July of this year.

According to an educator, the content of the old approved textbooks, except for those related to natural sciences, is mostly unsuitable for the current era. Therefore, this attempt to transplant old content will not yield good results, and the education authorities should promptly correct it.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper from Tianjin] The Northeast basketball elite, Changchun North Qing Team, arrived in Tianjin on the 6th and competed against strong teams from both the Chinese and Western communities. In nine matches, except for one win and one loss against the American soldiers, and the last match against Heping United, the Chinese basketball team won every game, and the generals in Beiping and Tianjin were all subdued. The team stayed in Tianjin for nearly half a month and showed excellent sportsmanship. The team of ten completed all the matches in Tianjin and returned to Changchun by train on the morning of the 22nd, led by Zou Renjun. The Pinglian basketball team also gained a lot from this trip to Tianjin and returned to Ping on the 21st.</p>
<p>Battle with Heping United</p>
<p>North Qing and Ping Lian met again in their last battle in Tianjin. Before 6 o'clock, the audience filled the Yuehua Gymnasium. The entire competition lacked tension slightly, but exciting moments were still discovered from time to time. Most of the North Qing team members were injured and tired, which inevitably affected their strength. The score was close in the first half, with North Qing always leading by one or two goals. The result was 20 to 16. In the second half, North Qing saw that the situation was not good, and Liu Jianhua and Tian He struggled to appear, which indeed showed improvement. However, Ping Lian fought with all their strength, and the battle was tense, resulting in a 26-28 tie. At the end of the third quarter, North Qing relied on Tian He's exploration under the basket to take the lead by one point with a score of 33 to 32. In the morning quarter, they first achieved a 33-33 situation. After entering, the fight became more intense, and Ping Lian forced the situation greatly. After a 42-42 tie, Zhen Mian scored two consecutive goals. Ma Chunxiang saved a goal, and with five seconds left in the game, Tian He finally tied the score with a final shot of 46 to 46, turning defeat into a tie. It was also considered lucky.</p>
<p>China Wins Suffers a Setback</p>
<p>Huasheng and American soldiers then opened fire, and national player Wang Yuzeng helped out, and the momentum suddenly increased. However, the Huasheng team lacked formal tactics, and Xu Zhaoxiong was too fat and slow in his movements. In the first quarter, they lost to the American soldiers 7 to 13. Wang Yuzeng made two long-range shots, and his skills were still good, but he had not practiced for a long time, and his strength was insufficient, so he did not play again in the second quarter and was replaced by Liu Baocheng. In the first half, they lost 18 to 25. At the beginning of the second half, the American soldiers were still very sharp. Only Liu Xuezhu performed well for Huasheng. The forward missed nine out of ten shots, and finally lost to the American soldiers 34 to 49.</p>
<p>Revenge on the American Soldiers</p>
<p>On the 10th, North Qing and the American soldiers met again. Referee Li Qingan Pai Kesi also adopted an eight-minute quarter system. In the center circle jump ball, the ball was passed back to Ma Di. Liu Jianhua was waiting under the basket, and the ball went into the net. After a 5-5 tie, Jianhua passed the ball cleverly, and Tian He scored. Jianhua was trapped in the enemy's formation, and Ma Chunhe hit a short throw, leading the American soldiers 13 to 7. The audience exclaimed, and in the first quarter, the American soldiers lost to North Qing 9 to 15. In the second quarter, the two armies were engaged in close combat, and each had their own wins and losses. At the end of the first half, North Ken led 29 to 22. At the start of the second half, Liu Jianhua once again took the field, and the audience cheered, with high expectations for him. He also left one of the deepest impressions on the Tianjin fans. In the third quarter, the score was 39 to 28, and the American soldiers were retreating steadily. In the fourth quarter, North Qing played steadily and surely, with the score at 36 to 42, and the situation was tense. Liu Jianhua lived up to expectations and made three appearances. The morale of the entire army was like a rainbow. Ma Qinghe scored a goal, and the American soldiers' penalty throw rose by three points. Jianhua's penalty period expired and he was forced to step down. With 25 seconds left on the field, the final whistle sounded, and North Qing defeated the stubborn enemy 44 to 39, completing its undefeated ambition in Tianjin. Before the game, in the battle between Ping Lian and Hua Team, Ping Lian luckily won against Hua Team 39 to 37, with a score of 16 to 14 in the first half, only two points apart.</p>
<p>Wins Over China Textile Again</p>
<p>On the 19th, North Qing played against China Textile again. Because North Qing's team was incomplete, they lightly defeated the China Textile United Team 29 to 19. In the first half, North Qing led by one goal with a score of 16 to 14. At one point, they were defeated 5 to 12. The China Textile United Team's killing skills were fierce, and North Qing was timid and avoided the important and took the light, which almost led to a repeat of the mistakes. However, Mao's performance on the China Textile team was quite good, and he will soon join Huasheng to seek mutual learning. In the decisive battle, Ping Lian was also not in good shape and lost to the American soldiers 20 to 34.</p>

<h3>Government Issues US Dollar Bonds; Good Response from Shanghai Financial Circles</h3>
<p>[Reported by Central News Agency from this city] The Central Standing Committee passed the issuance of short-term treasury bonds and US dollar public bonds totaling 400 million US dollars at its regular meeting yesterday morning. After this news spread to Shanghai, the industrial, commercial, banking, and financial circles were very excited and responded very well. In order to understand the opinions of all parties on this new measure of the government, the reporter specially visited people in the financial circles here. The opinions of all parties are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to Xu Jikang, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, he was not informed in advance about the government's issuance of US dollar bonds. It was not until he went to the Chamber of Commerce in the afternoon that he learned about it. He believes that issuing bonds at this time is a good opportunity and is a good strategy for recovering legal tender and channeling gold and foreign exchange through legitimate channels. In terms of the total amount of numbers, the proportion of responsibility is not large. In terms of the implementation process, the prospects can also be expected to be smooth. Because prices are currently stable, hoarding has decreased, and there is plenty of money in the banking and financial industries, there is spare capacity to purchase the bonds. As for the promotion, Mr. Xu advocated focusing on broad participation to make it universal, and not limiting it to the banking and financial industries, so that the benefits in the future will be more extensive. Regarding whether the future tightening of credit will affect prices, Mr. Xu believes that it is impossible.</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the National Defense Council passed the issuance of bonds totaling 400 million US dollars. The reporter specifically asked an observer for his opinion on this matter. He said: Since the government promulgated the new economic plan, gold and banknote transactions have been suspended, and floating funds in the market have become increasingly rampant, while prices have been relatively stable. It can be seen that floating funds are hesitant and looking for a way out. If these large floating funds are not absorbed, they will eventually cause trouble in prices. The government's issuance of huge US dollar bonds is a good way to absorb floating funds. If the bonds can be promoted to the fullest extent, it is predicted that future price trends will fall further.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Surge in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Public bonds were relatively weak yesterday morning, and a certain large account sold off a large amount during the session. However, the influential and powerful players in room 420 were still inclined to buy and had more positions. Unified C opened at 16,500 yuan, with the high price approaching the 20,000 yuan mark, and then fell back to a low price of 16,400 yuan at the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, A and B fell by 1,300 yuan, C fell by 2,000 yuan, and D and E each fell by 1,600 yuan, with a turnover of more than 20 million yuan. In the afternoon, news of the issuance of US dollar public bonds spread, and the buying sentiment was aroused by the passage of the National Defense Council. The price rose to 21,200 yuan, and finally settled slightly.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks: Floating Funds Active, Rising Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were more enthusiastic yesterday due to the influx of floating funds from various parties. Yisha rose from 21,500 yuan, and in the afternoon, it rose to 25,000 yuan, and then fell slightly due to profit-taking. The activity was too crowded, and buying and selling were once suspended after 11 o'clock. The listing of English Union Yibei and the opening of filming in Hong Kong were said to be dense. It was heard that rubber stocks would be opened for filming in Hong Kong, and there was little buying and selling. As a result, Yisha Yizhi rose by about 20% compared with the previous close, Hede Fengye Guang rose by more than 10%, and the rest rose by half.</p>
<h3>Export Subsidies Granted</h3>
<p>Limited to Export Goods from November 7th to 16th of Last Year</p>
<p>The Central Bank will grant export subsidies to exporters who sold foreign exchange to the Central Bank during the export subsidy period from February 7th to 16th of this year for export goods from November 7th to 16th of last year, but exporters must submit all export documents, otherwise it will be difficult to approve.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Convenes Oil Merchants to Discuss Thoroughly Eliminating the Black Market for Edible Oil</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu realized that the general prices in the city are gradually stabilizing, but the black market for edible oil is still rampant, which not only affects people's livelihood, but also stimulates the fluctuation of other prices, which is quite shocking. At 4 pm yesterday, he specially convened the president of the Oil Business Association, Zhang Chao, the person in charge of Zhongzhi Oil Factory, Qiu Liangyin, Wang Yangxian, and the representative of private oil factories, Xie Yuyi, to discuss at the Municipal Government. In addition to continuing to supply the retail outlets with the oil needed for retail sales, they will strictly investigate illegal oil merchants who hoard and raise prices, and are determined to thoroughly eliminate the black market.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Received for Consignment Sales Must Be Sold Within 60 Days</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank issued Circular No. 91 on the 25th to designated banks, stating that for consigned sales goods that have been shipped to the United States before February 17th of this year but have not yet been sold, and whose foreign exchange has not yet been sold, it is now stipulated that the foreign exchange can be sold to designated banks at the current exchange rate, but is limited to the following two conditions: (1) Within 60 days from the 25th of this month, the consigned sales goods must be sold, and the foreign exchange must be sold to the designated bank. (2) If the consignment seller cannot sell the goods within the above time limit, they must authorize the designated bank to transfer to its approved agent to sell the goods at a good price. In order to fulfill the item terms, from the 25th of this month, the consignment seller must provide the designated bank with a written guarantee within three days, proving that the authority has been given to the designated bank. The Central Bank does not intend to consider extending the above time limit. In the future, if the foreign market price is low, resulting in changes in the foreign exchange positions that can be sold, the Central Bank will consider and approve in advance on a case-by-case basis. If exporters do not follow the above methods, the Central Bank will require each exporter to sell their foreign exchange at the foreign exchange rate set in Circular No. 86. In addition, according to Shao Zhenhua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, the consigned sales goods have been in the United States for a long time, and the Central Bank has also stipulated that the sales goods must be sold within 90 days, but the merchants have not followed it. And according to the regulations, its foreign exchange must be sold to the designated bank at an exchange rate of 3,350 yuan. And this time, the Central Bank is lenient again and sells it at the current exchange rate. The sale of the goods will also be extended by another 60 days at the request of the exporters. Therefore, the Central Bank has given all possible convenience to the exporters.</p>
<h3>Pound Exchange Rate Will Not Change</h3>
<p>Since the Central Bank officially set the exchange rate for the pound at 40,000 yuan and sold it at 48,000 yuan, exporters generally believe that they are suffering significant losses in exporting goods to the UK and hope that the Central Bank will make adjustments. According to a reporter from the United Credit Information Service who inquired with the Central Bank, the current regulation of the pound exchange rate is extremely reasonable and is not likely to change in the near future. This is because the official exchange rate of the pound is determined based on the ratio between the US dollar and the pound. At that time, the US dollar was set at 12,000 yuan in national currency, and the actual value of converting legal tender into pounds was at most 40,000 yuan. Unless the US dollar fluctuates, the pound will not change independently. As for exporters buying at 48,000 yuan, this is their cost price, and adding a legitimate profit should not result in losses.</p>
<h3>Import Control Committee Approves Rubber Import Quota, Approves an Additional 900 Tons as a Temporary Supply</h3>
<p>Since the International Rubber Regulation Committee was dissolved, rubber products from Singapore, Java, Malaya, Saigon, and other places have been eagerly purchased by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries for shipment back home. The raw materials for China's rubber industry mainly rely on imports due to climate conditions, with only Hainan Island and Qiongzhou having some production. Based on actual needs, the 72 factories in Shanghai require 1,800 tons of rubber per month. In addition, factories in Guangzhou, Taiwan, Qingdao, Chongqing, Shenyang, Andong, and other places require a total of 2,000 tons per month. The total national demand is 3,800 tons per month. Since the establishment of the Import Control Committee, the import of rubber has been strictly restricted. Therefore, no new orders have been imported this year, and only last year's inventory is being used. After the industry's request, the Import Control Committee approved a temporary import of 400 tons last month. According to the person in charge of the industry, these 400 tons have been ordered from abroad and are expected to arrive in Shanghai within half a month. This month, another 500 tons have been approved, which will be reviewed and distributed by the industry association according to the machinery capacity of each factory. The distribution will be completed within days. At the end of this month, the Import Control Committee will issue the permits, allowing orders to be placed abroad. The industry is urgently hoping that the approved rubber can be imported as soon as possible to maintain production.</p>
<p>In addition, the government has approved a rubber import quota of US$1.1 million for the first quarter (February, March, April) of this year, to be jointly allocated by the rubber industry and the product industry. Yesterday, the industry association decided that the rubber industry would receive US$750,000 and the product industry would receive US$350,000. The current price of American rubber is US$500 per ton.</p>

<h3>White Coal Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The market trend for white coal chunks continues to rise, especially for high-grade Jiaozuo chunks and Hongji blocks, which are most popular. The supply of white coal dust is limited, except for some Lihua dust arriving. High-grade Hongji dust and others are also in short supply. However, due to slow sales of coal briquettes, transactions are extremely sluggish, making it difficult to boost the market. Anthracite coal transactions have seen a slight increase, but the transaction price is slightly lower than before.</p>

<h3>For Spring Fashion, Spring Fashion Special Issue, Shanghai Ladies Use Their Brains, 1947 Modern Styles Emerge</h3>
<p>The season of bright spring has arrived. Ladies are taking off their bulky winter clothes and planning to make the most fashionable and newest spring coats, which will make them look rich, majestic, and dignified, giving people a comfortable feeling.</p>
<p>In recent days, we have spent a lot of effort interviewing many fashion experts to inquire about the styles of ladies' spring coats this year. They or she are all based on the new styles of women's clothing from New York or Paris last month to make precise designs. This new style of spring coat has now been released.</p>
<p>Compared with last year, the biggest difference in this year's spring coat style is in the sleeves. The styles are ball sleeves, umbrella sleeves, and double-petal sleeves that have not been seen for many years. The sides are changed to wide and comfortable square sleeves, the arms are cylindrical, and the wrists are tight. These points are the most eye-catching. As for the front, there is not much change. The back is very wide, with three or four waves, fluttering in the wind, like a fairy. The collar still does not occupy an important position. The full length of the coat is about forty inches, forming a Spor Fashion, and the thirty-six-inch three-quarter coat (see picture) is also very suitable. Other decorations, such as buttons and belts, should be neat and generous. In terms of color, light colors are the main ones, such as light yellow, beige, light gray, and silver white, lined with dark underwear. The material should be thick, light, and soft. From the above styles, it can be seen that this year's fashion is not like in previous years, only increasing or decreasing in length and width, but the entire style has undergone a major reform.</p>
<p>Talking about Shanghai's fashion is actually very simple. At present, the general situation is that everyone, in addition to racking their brains on spring coats, the styles of other clothing are still quite poor. As for the appearance of the spring coats currently popular in Shanghai, most of them are still derived from American clothing. Although the styles of spring clothing in Europe and the United States may not be so simple, to cater to the tastes of general Shanghai ladies, then there must be considerable differences and trade-offs.</p>
<p>Western-style Pants and Short Jackets are Light and Lively</p>
<p>As for the Western-style pants and short jackets currently popular in Shanghai, according to a fashion expert, they are indeed very suitable for wearing at home, light and not cumbersome. As for whether they can "enter the hall of elegance," it is considered unlikely. So the conclusion is: the future fate of long pants and short jackets can only be limited to the home, at most becoming a popular "casual wear." If you want to talk about walking around in social circles or running around at banquets, then you have to think of something else. The main reason is that a short jacket is too ordinary. At the same time, the figure of Chinese ladies is limited by nature. Strictly from the perspective of beauty, it is probably difficult to find one or two suitable people to wear short clothes among ten thousand people.</p>
<p>The Style of Cheongsam is Not Likely to Change</p>
<p>Cheongsam is still the most suitable clothing for Chinese ladies. It is expected that the style of cheongsam will not change this year, but according to another expert, the most suitable length of a cheongsam should still be two or three inches below the knee. Too long is certainly out of date; too short, from an aesthetic point of view, if a pair of knees are exposed, it will damage the overall body posture.</p>
<p>Although British Fabrics Are Good, Domestic Products Are Also Improving</p>
<p>Speaking of clothing materials, of course, the best is still British goods, and the next best is American goods. As for the current Chinese wool fabrics, the quality and exquisiteness of the goods are really not inferior to American goods. According to the experience of a fashion expert, the progress of Chinese wool fabrics is very different from ten years ago.</p>
<p>The current price of popular coats in Shanghai ranges from 300,000 yuan to 1.5 million yuan. Among them, those costing 500,000 to 600,000 yuan can be made from American goods and high-quality Chinese goods. The market price of British goods is as high as 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the situation in the fashion industry this year is still quite developed. Spring has arrived, which is the time for Shanghai ladies to use their brains to change seasons. It is also the busiest season for fashion companies. As for leather bags and leather shoes outside of fashion, they can also affect the whole body the most. The popular leather bags this year are long rectangular styles with straps, with three or two very deep lines on each side. The kind of annoying shiny glass leather bags will be sent to the museum for display, and no one will ask about them anymore. The style of leather shoes is smooth, with a soft cork thick sole that reveals the big toe.</p>
<h3>"Buddha Needs Gold Clothing, People Need Clothes" How to Choose Your Clothing Material</h3>
<p>Spring is here. The willows have been dyed with new green, the flowers are beginning to bud, and the grass, caressed by the wind, looks vibrant. Birds are lively on the branches, playing the song of welcoming spring. The quiet garden everywhere shows excitement and freshness. If nature is like this, why should humans be any different? The little girl in the countryside is lively, innocent, but not glamorous, and does not attract people's attention because she only has a natural posture.</p>
<p>Selection of Materials</p>
<p>Beautiful clothing materials are also like the scenery of nature, vying for beauty and splendor. The azure blue seems like a clear sky after rain, the tender green is like rippling blue waves, the red is like bright roses, and the apricot yellow is like delicate wooden clogs. Often stepping into a large silk and satin company, the five colors are dazzling, and the variety of patterns is as complex and ever-changing as summer clouds. It is indeed painstaking to choose.</p>
<p>"Buddha needs gold clothing, people need clothes." Beautiful clothes will reduce a woman's age by ten years. Clothes have such great magic, so women want to borrow some. However, the beauty of clothes is not absolute. It depends on whether they are worn appropriately, whether the patterns match, and whether they can enhance her charm. It is a question of becoming a matter. Blindly imitating Dong Shi will only expose the ugliness. Women spend a lot of time going out to buy clothing materials. They will pick and choose in the store for two or three hours, but when they get home, they still feel that the material they bought is not right. They know that clothes are very important in modification, so they are not willing to waste a lot of time, but if they don't know the selection criteria, isn't all this time wasted?</p>
<p>Personality</p>
<p>Choosing clothing materials should be centered on yourself, with showing your personality as the main thing. This is not to be unconventional, but you cannot blindly follow the crowd without your own opinions. So, to choose clothes, you must first understand your own characteristics. It is best to show your advantages and hide your disadvantages. A person's characteristics are not easy to analyze. Generally speaking, there are differences in height, fatness, and thinness in appearance, and there are also differences in the depth of skin color. In terms of inner self, some people are active, showing a lively attitude, while others are quiet, with a reserved personality. It is not far off to choose clothing materials based on these points!</p>
<p>What is your figure like? What is your personality like?</p>
<p>Color</p>
<p>After you understand yourself, I will tell you the selection method. First, is the color of the clothes. Colors have differences in coldness and heat. So-called cold colors are light colors such as blue, green, and white. Conversely, deep colors such as red, orange, purple, and brown are warm colors. A full-figured person is suitable for cold colors, and a slender figure is more suitable for wearing warm colors. The depth of the skin color is the opposite of the color of the clothes. Fair skin can wear dark-colored clothes, and dark skin may choose lighter colors, but the intensity cannot be too far apart. Doesn't a black person wearing pure white clothes make black and white even more distinct? In terms of personality: lively people wear light colors well, and reserved people are more suitable for dark colors.</p>
<p>Pattern</p>
<p>Secondly, is the choice of patterns. Hasn't the large pattern material been popular recently? Wearing such a large number of patterns is like a tiger. It is suitable for tall and slender people. If a short and fat person still chooses simple small patterns, large patterns will show their plumpness. Striped materials are the easiest to show a person's fatness and thinness. Slender people should wear straight stripes, and plump people are suitable for horizontal stripes. The texture of the clothing material has soft and hard options. The essence of silk is mostly soft, while satin is relatively hard. Brocade, which was very popular in the past, is also hard. Plump bodies or lively personalities are suitable for wearing soft materials, while hard materials are suitable for thin people or people with calm personalities.</p>
<p>There are also differences in the style of tailoring. In terms of length, sometimes long styles are popular, with the hem almost covering the instep, and short styles are popular, short to the knees. Fashionable women, of course, have to do the latest styles, but they also have to ask themselves, don't do it too fashionable. Too short clothes are suitable for tall people, and can also appear more lively, so short people, or people with calm personalities, even when short styles are popular, should not be too short. The width of the cuffs also changes with the times. People who are tall and wear wide cuffs look slender. Short or full people can hide it a little by wearing narrow cuffs.</p>
<p>Wearing clothes changes with the seasons. However, it is most difficult to determine in this not cold and not hot, yet cold and hot spring. As the saying goes: "In February and August, people dress randomly." So this point can be slightly ignored in the spring. If it is summer or winter, you have to pay special attention.</p>
<p>There are three motives for wearing clothes: (1) to protect the body, (2) to cover shame, and (3) to decorate. Because it has a decorative effect, many changes have taken place in the form.</p>
<p>The style of clothing can be divided into seven categories: (1) placement of trophies, (2) intimidating effect, (3) sexual seduction, (4) occupational representation, (5) gender representation, (6) regional characteristics, (7) religious beliefs. Analyzing women's fashion, the third category has the most components.</p>
<h3>Spring Fashion Tidbits</h3>
<p>Clothing contains dualistic effects: (1) making the body taller, such as wearing high heels and high hats. (2) Enlarging or shrinking the body, such as wide sleeves, wide skirts, waist binding, and breast binding. (3) Indicating special parts of the body, such as wearing rings or other decorations on the nose, hands, feet, neck, and waist. (3) Describing the movements of a certain part of the body, such as ribbons and bells.</p>
<p>Originally, in the animal kingdom, the attraction between the sexes often utilizes color. Peacocks display their beautiful plumage, and butterflies flutter their wings, mostly to show their beautiful colors to the opposite sex. People in primitive times had the custom of tattooing, which was considered to increase beauty. After clothing was invented, tattooing was no longer needed. Similarly, the styles, colors, and patterns of clothes are more changeable than tattooing. But tattooing has not been completely abolished, but is only limited to the face. Powdering, applying rouge, dabbing lips, drawing eyebrows, and even dyeing nails are variations of tattooing.</p>
<p>Wearing clothes is a link in social life and is closely related to the changes in social politics and economy. Generally speaking, women's clothing changes faster than men's clothing. In the past 30 years, women's clothing has been changing rapidly, which shows that women's lives have suddenly changed in the past 30 years. They have been liberated from the deep chambers of secluded boudoirs, stepped into society, and are engaged in occupations, so there should naturally be a major revolution in clothing.</p>
<h3>Knitted Wool Coat</h3>
<p>Knitted wool fabrics are now considered very ordinary clothing, but it has only been popular in China for more than 50 years. At first, the use of early wool rope was only for tying hair. After the invention of knitting technology, the sales of wool rope were promoted. But at that time, the things woven from wool rope were only hats, gloves, scarves and other items. It was later that vests and clothes were woven from wool rope.</p>
<p>Wool vests or clothes were mostly lined at first, and were very popular because they were light, thin and warm. Later, the wool clothes were moved from the inside to the outside, and there were more things to do, because wearing them on the outside, you had to take into account the beauty, so many new patterns were turned over.</p>
<p>The first thing worn on the outside was a wool vest, which replaced the long cheongsam waistcoat. When coats became popular, wool vests were abandoned by fashionable women.</p>
<p>After the short-sleeved cheongsam became popular, in the chilly spring, the two sections of jade arms were exposed outside, and it seemed a little cold, so someone tried to make a short wool shirt to cover the cheongsam. This not only reduced the monotony of the long cheongsam, but also increased the slenderness of the figure. A pair of jade arms covered in the wool shirt were not cold. Later, the sleeves of the wool shirt worn outside the cheongsam went from long to short, and short to nothing. At that time, the two arms were liberated from the wool again. At this point, the wool clothing became purely a decoration outside the cheongsam, with no meaning of keeping warm. In recent years, the wool shirt worn outside the cheongsam has been changed again, from short to the breast, extended to the hips, and the sleeves have been lengthened again. In this way, it is not a short wool shirt, but a wool coat.</p>
<p>Of course, leather or camel hair coats cannot be worn at home. Even if they are woolen coats, they don't look good when worn at home, and they are not convenient for doing things. Wool coats have the name of a coat, but without the burden of a coat, they can be worn at home without hindering work. At the same time, wool fabrics can be disassembled, washed and re-knitted if they are stained with grease. Wool coats are not as luxurious as leather coats or as elegant as woolen coats, but wearing them outside a cheongsam can also avoid the monotony of color.</p>
<p>Since the Tianjin Ram wool yarn factory in Shanghai launched a sound conference in 1933 and publicly taught knitting methods, the knitting styles have been constantly updated. The wool coat that is popular today has more ingenious patterns. In addition to knitting skills, there are also many flower embroidery on it, which increases the beauty.</p>
<p>Knitting is a very simple needlework, and can be done almost anywhere. Many female employees often bring wool to the office, and when there is no official business to do, they take it out of the drawer and knit for a while. In the classrooms of girls' schools, many female students listen to lectures and knit at the same time. They are already skilled and do not need to think about it.</p>
<h3>Compiled by the Editorial Office and Reference Room of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Paris, is the art capital of the world. Parisian fashion, tempts all the mothers and daughters around the world with fascination. Someone wants to ask, how do Parisian fashion experts tailor this year's new clothes? How does this new style become popular in every big city in the world? In fact, the so-called new clothes are just slightly changing the old styles, or adding some small patterns with ingenuity, which is considered a new style. The trend of the times is constantly fluctuating, and women's clothing is also changing from time totime, with the waves behind pushing the waves ahead. After a period of time, perhaps the old patterns will still become popular. As for whether a new pattern can be promoted to the world, it is entirely the magic of fashion experts, an incomprehensible mystery.</p>
<p>When the 1947 Paris fashion is being performed today, there are thousands of clothes and thousands of coats. From the style point of view, they are mostly the same and can be called "Manteau Style." In more common terms, it can be said to be "Romantic Style." A tight-fitting top paired with a longer skirt shows a precarious look, fully expressing the slender figure of a morbidly beautiful woman. This style is gradually returning to the style of 1920.</p>
<p>Leather has become the main decoration on clothes. Collars, cuffs, and hems are all inlaid with leather, and the neck is hidden in the leather collar. Wide-brimmed hats, plus two or three beautiful feathers, are also new patterns this year. Women who wear their hair on top and wear this hat can be proud of their companions on the streets of Paris.</p>
<p>New York fashion is very different from Paris. Wear a narrow top with a round collar opening to the chest and small sleeves that reach the elbows. The skirt below is a half-length skirt that covers the knees, but the hem is much wider than before. Walking in it gives it a fluttering look.</p>
<p>The thinking of women in the New World is the newest. In addition to a few places on their bodies that are attention-grabbing, the rest are liberated as much as possible. The evening gowns that have been popular have only a pair of breasts on the upper body, and the rest is completely naked. The so-called bra is not the one that was tied with a strap and hidden in the clothes in the past. Now that it has been exposed on the outside, using a strap seems to be unable to keep up with the times, so there are only two semi-circular wire rings covering the breasts.</p>

<h3>Review of "Yuan Ci Lü"</h3>
<p>— Cai Zhenghua</p>
<p>Compiled by Wang Yuzhang, published by The Commercial Press. Volumes 1 to 4 have been released; Volumes 5 to 10 are in printing.</p>
<p>When discussing Yuan opera today, we inevitably engage in armchair theorizing. Since we cannot resurrect the Yuan people from the earth, how can we know their singing styles? Regarding the rules of opera, from "Taihe Zheng Yin Pu" to "Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu," no matter how precise they are, we only know how things are, not why they are so. Disputes often arise, and there is no consensus. However, we are fortunate to have these books, which allow us to understand the norms of the Yuan people to some extent. "Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu" is good, but it still has omissions. The so-called "words and phrases are not fixed and can be added or subtracted" sometimes leaves us wondering which phrases are added and which are subtracted.</p>
<p>Using the methods of studying the classics and history to study opera is a recent development. By using scientific methods to summarize, we have gained a deeper understanding of the northern opera scores. When Wu Qu'an lectured at Southeast University, he wrote a "Simplified Northern and Southern Opera Score," which collected the strengths of various theories. It was a carefully crafted work, but it was only a simplified score. Following this was Wang Yuzhang's "Yuan Ci Jiao Lü." This book was published by The Commercial Press in the 25th year of the Republic of China, with only four volumes. The first volume is Huangzhong Palace, the second volume is Zheng Palace, the third volume is Dashi Tune, and the fourth volume is Xianlü Palace, forming the upper part. It took three years to complete the draft. Soon after, the Japanese invaders caused trouble, and the author sought refuge in Sichuan, which delayed the work for a long time. The first draft of the lower part was kept in Shanghai, and fortunately, it was not lost during the war. Recently, the author completed it with day and night efforts. The fifth volume is Zhonglü Palace, the sixth volume is Nanlü Palace, the seventh volume is Shuang Tune, the eighth volume is Yue Tune, the ninth volume is Shang Tune, and the tenth volume is Banshe Tune, forming the lower part, which will also be published by The Commercial Press and will soon be available.</p>
<p>The compilation method of this book is to arrange all the operas in Zang Jinshu's "Diaochong Guan Qu Xuan" in order to compare and contrast them to find the standard. Since the attitude is very cautious, it is different from "Yingshu Yanshu." In all fairness, there is no other reliable way to study the music theory of the Yuan people today. Wu Qu'an wrote in the preface:</p>
<p>"From 'Taihe Zheng Yin Pu' downwards, 'Bei Ci Guang Zheng Pu' is the best, but it still has the problem of being too dense with beat markings. It should be understood that northern opera has no fixed beat, and the density of the beat markings depends on the number of words, and the sound changes accordingly. Also, at the points where the beat changes, the singer raises and lowers their voice, showcasing the beauty of the sound and text. This is also determined by the momentum of the opera's sound. Therefore, Xuan Yu's numerous beat markings should be deleted by those who write lyrics and create scores. This is precisely the strength of 'Guang Zheng Pu,' but it is also the source of disputes. Wang Yuzhang's book does not mark the beat at all. It only explores the reason for the commonality of words and phrases, and also provides collateral evidence and analysis of the differences in added phrases, formats, and ending tunes, resolving the disputes of various schools and enlightening the confusion of later learners. Its contribution to the artistic community is not small."</p>
<p>He also said: "Some say that the sentence patterns of northern opera are not fixed. For example, the first two phrases of 'Jishengcao' have three words, but Bai Renfu's 'Chang Zui Hou He Fang'ai, Bu Xing Shi You Shen Si' has six words. The first two phrases of 'Chao Tianzi' have two words, but Wang Yuanheng's 'Ronghua Meng Yi Chang, Gongming Zhi Ban Zhang' has five words. If the beat can be added and the phrases are not fixed, then there is no way to set an example for the predecessors or show anything to future generations. What harm is there if there is no score? They do not know that the writer adds words to express the changes of the mind, and the music theorist sets the score to establish the correctness of the lyrical method. If the differences in phrase structure are not used to understand the root cause, then it will inevitably be chaotic and disordered. Labeling a piece as a certain tune does not conform to the style of that tune. This is what Tang Ruoshi called 'twisting the voice.' How can Wang Yuzhang's efforts be lacking?"</p>
<p>Then, with this book, we can have some basis for disputes over music theory. However, we must also say that according to the author's introductory remarks: "The selection of tunes in each volume is determined by whether or not they are recorded in Zang's collection. Zang's collection of Yuan operas is the richest, and no one in later generations can match it. If we use Zang's collection as the standard and the rhythm of this book as the model, then writing and performing operas will be easy. Why seek anything else? Therefore, the complete works and miscellaneous dramas of ancient and modern times, as well as the Yuan operas collected by Shemotazhi, are not included." This was said in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Yuan and Ming miscellaneous dramas collected by Yeeshi Garden were suddenly discovered at sea. The entire collection consists of seventy-two volumes, totaling two hundred and sixty-nine types, with eight volumes missing, totaling twenty-seven types. Excluding the ninety-four types that have already been seen in Yuan Qu Xuan and recent printed editions, and the four duplicate copies, there are one hundred and fourteen types that have never been seen before. The "Yuan Ci Jiao Lü" is based on Zang's selection, which, including the six types from the early Ming Dynasty, is no more than one hundred types. In terms of the total number of Yuan operas that exist today, it is less than half. Since the compilation method is based on comparing and classifying, it is necessary to seek comprehensiveness in order to facilitate induction. At that time, since they had not seen the Yeeshi Garden collection, there was naturally no way to compare. From this, we can see that in the study of knowledge, later generations may have many advantages over their predecessors.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the introductory remarks also say: "There are only about twenty types of Yuan Dynasty lyrical poems that have been passed down to this day, and the various records of Qunzhu Qunyu are not included. In the future, we plan to create a separate collection, so this book does not involve this data." Then, the newly discovered Yuan operas can also be created as a separate collection in the future, or it would be best to combine them together, so that the differences can be seen at a glance, and the evidence obtained will be stronger.</p>
<h3>Collation and Bibliography</h3>
<p>— Hesheng</p>
<p>Book Title: "Essentials of Collation, Bibliography, and Learning"</p>
<p>Author: Jiang Boqian</p>
<p>Publisher: Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>Publication Date: December, 35th year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Tong Zhixuan said in the preface to Ma Daoyuan's "Bibliography" (Commercial Press edition, 23rd year of the Republic of China): "In ancient times, knotted ropes were used for governance. Later, writing was invented, then bamboo tablets, then silk, then paper. Then woodblock printing was invented. With the rise of printing, the use of books became more widespread. The Seven Summaries and the Four Treasuries are vast as the sea. They are either divided into categories to clarify the examples, or they are interpreted and researched to elaborate on the evaluations. Thus, there is the study of bibliography. Over time, errors and omissions arose. There were misplaced slips, redundant words, or even mistakes due to similar characters. Thus, there is the study of collation. The Stone Classics of the Han Dynasty, the Buddhist scriptures carved in the Tang Dynasty, the Song Dynasty editions, the Yuan Dynasty editions, the palace editions, and the commercial editions were compared based on their binding or distinguished based on their format. Thus, there is the study of bibliography."</p>
<p>It can be seen that bibliography, collation, and bibliography are closely related and gradually emerged according to historical needs. However, each has its own responsibilities and boundaries, and they cannot be mixed together. Ordinary researchers of bibliography have always regarded the two tasks of "collation" and "bibliography" as consistent and inseparable. Now, according to Tong's statement, "collation" and "bibliography" are clearly two different things, and "bibliography" is also one thing. It can be seen that the scope of bibliography is undoubtedly broad. There are actually two perspectives on the study of bibliography, one narrow and one broad. In the narrow sense, collation refers to the collation of the words, chapters, and volumes of books, and bibliography refers to the compilation of the contents of a book, or the compilation of a category of books, or even the bibliography of various categories of books. In the broad sense, collation actually includes bibliography. Since the theories of Zheng Qiao and Zhang Xuecheng became popular, broad collation not only includes bibliography, but also believes that emphasis should be placed on the study of bibliography, and even includes bibliography. Over time, bibliography and bibliography gradually emerged from narrow collation as separate disciplines, which is what modern people have described as broad collation.</p>
<p>This book aims to compile the essentials of broad collation. However, in order to make it easier for readers to understand the scope of what is being described, it is named after "collation" and "bibliography." In other words, it describes the two tasks of collation and cataloging, and also touches on bibliography. The book is divided into two parts, upper and lower, totaling 204 pages. The upper part describes the history of collation and cataloging, divided into official collation, private collation, historical and geographical bibliographies, specialized bibliographies, religious bibliographies, and other special bibliographies. The lower part describes the content of collation and bibliography, divided into seeking out books, correcting words, determining chapters, writing prefaces, identifying authenticity, collecting lost texts, classifying and cataloging, and so on.</p>
<p>There are many books on collation. In the past, there was Liu Xiang's collation in the Han Dynasty, Zheng Qiao's "Brief Collation" in the Song Dynasty (one of the twenty summaries of the Tongzhi), Zhang Xuecheng's "General Meaning of Collation" in the Qing Dynasty (Zhang's posthumous works), and in modern times, there was Du Dingyou's "New Meaning of Collation" (typeset and printed in the 19th year of the Republic of China), Hu Pu'an and Hu Daojing's "Collation" (Commercial Press, typeset and printed in the 20th year of the Republic of China), Fu Zhenlun's "New Theory of Collation" (published in the second issue of the fifth volume of the Journal of Library Science, June, 20th year of the Republic of China), Jiang Yuanqing's "History of Collation" (Commercial Press, 24th year of the Republic of China), and so on.</p>
<p>Collation has always been regarded as the study of managing books, the basic work for studying knowledge, and an important work for researchers. The object of managing books is books, and books are an indispensable tool for researchers. Therefore, researchers must understand the study of managing books in both the narrow and broad senses. Since researchers use books as the basis, the study of collation cannot be ignored. Since collation is so important, narrow collation cannot fulfill the responsibility of managing books completely. It must include narrow collation, bibliography, and bibliography. In other words, the study of managing books is broad collation.</p>
<p>In recent times, library undertakings have become increasingly widespread, and the number of people studying library science has increased. However, in reality, there are many people engaged in library undertakings, but few study bibliography, and even fewer study collation and bibliography. Since collation is the study of managing books, researchers of library science and those engaged in library undertakings must also study bibliography and collation, and must also study bibliography. Then, they can explore the origins and be said to have exhausted the way of managing books. Today, those who run libraries attach great importance to classification and cataloging, but often neglect collation and bibliographic research. As a result, they have not fully researched the way of studying knowledge in the entire field of library science. Now, reading Jiang's "Essentials of Collation, Bibliography, and Learning" can be said to have grasped the essentials of the method of managing books. I would like to introduce it to researchers of library science and bibliography.</p>
<h3>Solutions to Physics Calculation Problems</h3>
<p>— Co-edited by Wang Weilian and Wang Zhishan, published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>Physics is a science that requires calculation, but general physics textbooks ignore this point. They often provide superficial introductions to some advanced theories, while lacking practical discussions of many basic principles. Therefore, many students, after completing high school and university courses, still have a vague impression of physics and do not really understand it. It is truly like climbing a tree to catch a fish to expect such students to be able to further study academics and make discoveries. I believe that if we want Chinese scholars to be able to contribute to science, it is not so much about sending people abroad to study or buying more foreign journals and new books as references, but about enabling Chinese students to have a deep understanding and comprehension of various basic principles. Only when the foundation is solid can the branches flourish. The domestic scientific atmosphere can gradually become thicker, keeping pace with other countries in the world. After years of searching, I finally discovered this wonderful book—"Solutions to Physics Calculation Problems" co-authored by Wang Weilian and Wang Zhishan, published by Zhonghua Book Company.</p>
<p>In this book, there are no irrelevant theories, no captivating rhetoric, only one problem after another, and line after line of numbers. It is divided into two volumes, twelve chapters, with thousands of problems of various types.</p>
<p>Any student who can fully understand this book can be said to have thought through more than half of the applications and exercises of various basic principles in physics. That's why I say this book is a wonderful book.</p>
<p>Especially in China, where general authors and translators like to create mysteries, translate obscure masterpieces, and describe irrelevant theories to show off to others, the value of this book is even more worthy of attention because it is engaged in basic work. If the Chinese scientific community can achieve something in physics in ten years, this book is the seed of that achievement.</p>
<p>After reading this book, on the one hand, I feel that it is a wonderful book, and on the other hand, I also feel a little insufficient. Science is constantly advancing and changing with each passing day. It seems necessary to revise this book, which has been published for many years.</p>
<p>The study of all problems has a certain path, which is to "understand the principle, master the method, and exhaust the changes." This book can enable general students to reach the stage of "understanding the principle" in consultation with textbooks, but it cannot enable general students to 100% reach the stage of "mastering the method." I hope that the compilation of the book can be slightly modified to adopt the example problem-exercise problem system. In the original book, many problems can be summarized into one category. An example problem should be given for each category. For example, in the original book's chapter on expansion, problems 41, 43, 45, 46, 50, 54, 61, 62, 63, 64 can all be solved using the formula P1V1/T1 = . Therefore, it seems that only the problem should be listed, without providing the solution, so that students can solve it themselves. This is more likely to achieve the effect of mastering the method. Also, in the original book's chapter on expansion, problems 39, 74, 75, 56, 79 have many changes and should be converted into formula problems. Each problem should be attached with exercise problems, ranging from four or five to more than ten, or even hundreds, for students to calculate. Also, in the original book's chapter on specific heat, problem 44 can be used as an example problem, and problems 41, 42, 43 of the same chapter can be attached below as exercise problems. This makes it easier for students to have a clear impression of various phenomena. The author tried to do this in his early years, but was unable to complete it due to limited academic ability and other tasks. If the two gentlemen do not abandon this idea, I will write another article detailing the method to inform them and ask for their correction.</p>
<p>The creation of example problems is relatively difficult because general books do not publish them, and they are rarely seen in difficult journals. Therefore, it all depends on the author's personal efforts to classify the problems they have seen on weekdays. The exercise problems attached to each example problem should, in principle, be taken from the entrance examination questions and regular test questions of universities and middle schools in China, and the figures of famous experiments, and the correct answers and their sources should be noted at the end of each problem, so that they can be used for both purposes.</p>
<p>Many problems have several solutions. For example, the calculation of falling bodies can be solved using the falling body formula, or it can be solved using the relationship between potential energy and kinetic energy. The book should specifically point this out, and use different solutions for the same problem to arouse students' interest.</p>
<p>For many formulas, special attention should be paid to their units. Many operations are prone to errors, and special attention should be paid to them. It seems that the method of side notes should be adopted to note them one by one, so that students can reduce learning errors caused by occasional negligence.</p>
<p>I also have a hope that the book can have the opportunity to be revised and become an exercise lecture for students studying in school and a good guide for self-study students, giving physics learners a way to enter the door and giving those who have studied physics a commonly used handbook.</p>
<p>Although this book is not 100% good, in today's lack of Chinese science books, every young person with lofty ideals in science and engineering should have one copy. At the same time, I hope that Mr. Wang Weikang and Wang Zhishan have the responsibility to revise the book to make it more perfect, extensive, and clear.</p>
<h3>Publication News</h3>
<p>The International Publishing House recently published "The Constitution of the Republic of China in Chinese-English Translation," with the implementation preparation procedures, the organizational regulations of the Constitutional Promotion Association, and a comparison of the revised constitutional draft and the May 5th constitutional draft, which is very convenient for reference. Each copy costs 10,000 yuan and is available at the Art Institute, 7 Qinghai Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>"Reading Guidance"</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Huang Weilian and Li Bojia, a total of three series, published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>The Commercial Press, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, on the one hand, to increase readers' interest, and on the other hand, to meet the needs of the times, opened a new guideline for those who advocated the reading movement at that time, and solved the problem of how to read books. It specially added a "Reading Guidance" column in the "Publishing Weekly" of the museum, and widely invited domestic scientific and academic experts to write various scientific research methods, which were published in each issue, and were well received by readers. Later, the disclosed texts were compiled into a single volume to facilitate readers and spread the price. It can be seen that the way to read books cannot be started casually. To know that reading books requires a method, so that you can save time and get considerable results.</p>
<p>This book collects the articles published in the "Reading Guidance" column of the "Publishing Weekly" published by The Commercial Press in the past ten years. Three series have been published before and after, with a total of ninety-six research methods from various disciplines. The subjects covered include thirty-six categories, divided into general, library science, classics, philosophy, psychology, ethics, Buddhism, society, astronomy, chemistry, physics, geology, biology, botany, industry, medicine, physiology, engineering, mineralogy, agriculture, home economics, art, literature, history, geography, and archeology. There are many categories that are similar in the three series, but the titles of each article are not repeated. The authors of each article are all well-known experts in their respective fields in China. They use simple words and thorough theories to integrate the research methods used by scholars at home and abroad, and their own experiences, to open up new paths for readers. Not only can readers obtain the gateway to research in the shortest time for advanced academics, but also can guide beginners to make precise explorations in theory and practice, so as to easily obtain the mysteries of science and academics.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of the published articles: In the field of philosophical research, there are Zhang Dongsun's "How to Study Philosophy" and Feng Youlan's "How to Study the History of Chinese Philosophy"; in the field of politics, there is Yang Youjiong's "How to Study Political Science"; in the field of economics, there are Tang Qingzeng's "Economic Research Methods," Li Quanshi's "Financial Research Methods," and Pan Xulun's "How to Study Accounting"; in the field of education, there is Ai Wei's "How to Study Educational Psychology"; in the field of science, there are Li Yan's "How to Study the History of Chinese Mathematics" and Wang's "Chemical Research Methods"; in the field of engineering, there is Zhao Zengjue's "How to Research and Select Engineering"; in the field of language, there is Li Jinxi's "How to Study the National Language"; in the field of literature, there are Zhang Ziping's "Fiction Research" and Wu Lifu's "How to Study Western Literature"; in the field of history, there is Lu Simian's "How to Continue Chinese History," and so on. In modern times, science is prosperous and changing with each passing day, and the books and sayings of various sciences and academics are as vast as the sea. It is also impossible to browse the army collection. Moreover, everything is precious to get its way. Once there is a way, you can devote yourself to research and get twice the result with half the effort. Therefore, to enable scholars to obtain the most appropriate guidance, so as not to waste precious time and obtain considerable satisfactory results, is an urgent need.</p>
<p>At the end of each series, there are also resumes of the authors, so that readers can have a deeper understanding of their academic qualifications. Mr. Cai Yuanpei said in the preface to the first series that this book is like the finger of Lu Xian Dongbin, which can turn stones into gold. Its characteristics are that it is convenient for self-study, convenient for reference, and convenient for increasing common sense. It can be truly called the compass for reading guidance. I hope that we can continue to publish books in the future, so that it can become an encyclopedia guidance book.</p>
<h3>Reading "Crime and Punishment"</h3>
<p>— Dongyuan</p>
<p>Authored by Dostoevsky, Translated by Wei Congwu, Printed by Shanghai Wenguang Bookstore</p>
<p>The new, fully translated edition of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic, in two volumes,</p>
<p>is priced at $16,000.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>This work by Dostoevsky can be said to be his most important novel, and it has been welcomed by a wide readership around the world. China is no exception, and there are several translations available. Among these translations, Mr. Wei Congwu's translation is considered the best.</p>
<p>Wei's complete translation also has its own history. The translator states clearly in the preface to the latest edition that this book was printed five times in the seven years before the war, which is certainly a sign of progress among Chinese readers. Even from the publisher's perspective, it transitioned from the "Weiming" edition to the "Kaiming" edition, after which it was discontinued for nine years due to the war. Until recently, it transitioned from the "Kaiming" edition to the "Jiaoguang" edition, appearing before readers with a new look.</p>
<p>In today's environment, where publishing conditions are so difficult, many literary masterpieces can be reprinted, such as "Jean-Christophe," "War and Peace," and this "Crime and Punishment," etc. This is indeed a welcome phenomenon in publishing, which the reading community hopes to maintain and develop.</p>
<p>What we are reading now is, of course, the new Wenguang edition. Under the author's authentic writing style, I seized every free moment to quickly finish reading this work, not wanting to miss any opportunity to read it. Frankly speaking: it is the vivid and realistic story that captivated me.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>This work centers on the tragic and impoverished youth, Rodion Raskolnikov. The author uses compelling writing to depict his miserable life and the harsh treatment he receives from society.</p>
<p>Raskolnikov (Raskolnikov for short) originally made a living teaching, but he recently lost his job. His family is declining and very poor, relying entirely on a pension for sustenance with only his mother and sister. After losing his job, Raskolnikov's financial difficulties increased daily. Helpless, he had no choice but to pawn his belongings to an old woman who specialized in usury. She was a notorious exploiter who not only charged high interest but also confiscated pawned items as soon as they expired, accumulating a considerable fortune. Raskolnikov even pawned the watch left by his father to her. His inner resentment was profound.</p>
<p>When Raskolnikov went to a tavern, trying to alleviate his sorrow with alcohol, he found that the other drinkers were there for the same reason: to escape their inner suffering. In particular, the poor clerk, Marmeladov, poured out his many grievances to Raskolnikov.</p>
<p>In every way, Raskolnikov's anger and sorrow increased. The next day, he received a letter from his sister, saying that she was willing to marry a wealthy old merchant for the sake of her brother's future happiness. After reading this letter, Raskolnikov's heart was filled with turmoil. A limitless anger surged within him. He hated the cruelty of the world, and the more he hated it, the more his anger rose. As a result, he harbored murderous thoughts and desperately wanted to vent.</p>
<p>Driven by this thought, he went home, took a sharp axe, and went to the pawnbroker he had long resented. Upon arriving, he quickly killed her with several blows of the axe. As he was about to take her money, the old woman's sister came in. In a panic, he killed her as well. Then, someone knocked on the door, and he hurriedly grabbed her money bag and fled.</p>
<p>After he fled home, his pure conscience was burdened with heavy chains. He became delirious and suffered from a feverish illness for many days.</p>
<p>Later, at the urging of a newly acquainted lover, the prostitute Sonya, he went to confess his crime. Although Sonya had fallen into prostitution, her soul was pure. After urging Raskolnikov to confess, the psychologist certified that he was given a light sentence of only eight years.</p>
<p>During these eight years, although he was exiled to Siberia to perform hard labor, he realized the truth in the work, saw a new path, cherished hope for their new future, embraced Christianity, and was given new hope!</p>
<p>I cannot describe the entire outline here. The above is the main part of this work, which is presented with this as its theme. (111)</p>
<p>This work depicts all the protagonists from the lower classes, who are considered lowly by some writers, but it portrays them justly and shows that, despite their seemingly lowly appearance, their hearts are pure and their souls are clean.</p>
<p>The author himself had always been in the midst of suffering and hardship. He had been sentenced to death and had also been sent to Siberia to perform hard labor. Therefore, the author's own rich experiences made what he wrote a reflection of reality, a vivid performance of life.</p>
<p>The author never had a happy day in his life, but in his painful life, he produced many indelible masterpieces. We can easily name a few: "Poor People," "The Insulted and Injured," "Dead Souls," "The Idiot," and so on. "Crime and Punishment" is also one of the main ones. His achievements cannot be denied, and the whole world cannot deny them, because his works are forged from the blood and flesh of real life.</p>
<p>Some say that Dostoevsky's work is not as meticulous as Turgenev's, and that is true. Precisely because he did not have as much time as Turgenev to carefully revise, he was waiting for his works to exchange for life. However, this does not obscure his achievements. Although the form is not as refined as Turgenev's, the value of the content is very high.</p>
<p>As for his often leading the protagonist to the name of Christ, this is his religious belief. However, he is different from the general preacher, because he gives people a new path to goodness. The translator also has an explanation in the introduction.</p>
<p>In short, in his writing, he wrote about the painful situation of the oppressed—the insulted and injured, revealing the truth with great sympathy!</p>
<h3>Random Talks in Dubo</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Gold pounds may influence history, but they cannot guarantee that honor will be attributed to oneself.</p>
<p>People are naturally inclined to sympathize with those who have suffered misfortune. However, paradoxically, people often enjoy creating misfortune for others besides themselves.</p>
<p>Gold pounds can buy the activity of the body, but not necessarily the activity of the soul.</p>
<p>An unfortunate actress later became a wealthy man's concubine. Every day, apart from fawning over her master, she abused another hapless maid.</p>
<p>Once, she went to see a play and saw a maid being abused on stage. She was moved to tears. But when she returned home, she forgot again and continued to whip her maid.</p>
<p>When she had nothing to do, she would ask a fortune teller to tell her fortune, but she forgot to look in her mirror—the maid she whipped every day. Or else, she would go to the temple and burn incense respectfully, praying that everything would be good for herself and that others would die sooner. However, she never thought about what she was living for.</p>
<p>A hideous person discovered his ugliness. So he devised a scheme to destroy all the mirrors in the world.</p>
<p>However, this ugly person did not become beautiful because of it.</p>
<p>One day, the ugly person discovered his ugly reflection in his own urine, so he hated his urine as much as he hated mirrors, vowing not to urinate.</p>
<p>The ugly person eventually died, suffering from a strange urinary disease.</p>
<p>An ugly person who can recognize his own ugliness is a remarkable hero among all ugly people. As for his aesthetic psychology, it is also a good trend. Moths die for fire, ugly people die for beauty, becoming glorious miracles of insects and humans.</p>
<p>After a moth dies, it should be posthumously named General of Fire Virtue Yanhai; after an ugly person dies, he should be posthumously named Duke Meizhong.</p>
<p>Chekhov once questioned Tolstoy about whether he liked his plays.</p>
<p>"I don't like them, they're worse than Shakespeare's!" Tolstoy said bluntly.</p>
<p>Clearly, this stubborn and opinionated old man was afraid of seeing his own shadow in Chekhov's plays.</p>
<h3>Irregular Climate and Seasonal Diseases</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>Recently, news of the spread of seasonal diseases, such as smallpox, diphtheria, and even meningitis, has often appeared in the newspapers. These are all things that can be fatal, so seeing such news inevitably makes one shudder and feel the fear and worry that life can be lost at any time.</p>
<p>The cause of these seasonal diseases is often attributed to the irregularity of the climate, as if the heavens are deliberately opposing us. And looking at the climate, it is suddenly cold and suddenly hot, suddenly windy and suddenly rainy, which seems really abnormal. When a group of people meet on weekdays, they always fail to learn the cultivation skills of "Today's weather, haha," and they invariably complain about the heavens. According to our ideals, it seems that the cold, heat, rain, and snow of the four seasons should have a fixed time and a fixed progress, just like sunset and sunrise. Especially the temperature of the climate should slowly climb up the thermometer from spring to summer, and then climb down from autumn to winter, with no other advances or retreats in between, and especially the current kind of wild throwing and giant immersion, large ups and downs, should be absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the heavens are not so rigid. At the same time, according to geographers, the temperate zone in which we live is precisely because of this kind of sudden warming and sudden cooling that stimulates mankind and produces civilizations that cannot be achieved in other zones. That is to say, under this climate that refuses to be normal, it can produce both a high degree of civilization and terrible plagues. Civilization or plague depends on our own choices, because the mercury on the thermometer cannot manufacture these things. When Xiang Yu was surrounded in Dongcheng, he sighed, "This is the heavens that are destroying me, not the fault of war." We are really not qualified to laugh at this ancient man today.</p>
<p>Smallpox, diphtheria, and meningitis, etc., always come to visit at this time of year. If these epidemics had a spirit, they would definitely curse the climate with us in unison:</p>
<p>"Irregular things! Look at us, we never miss a point every year, how normal we are!"</p>
<h3>The "Greening" Movement</h3>
<p>— Qingwen</p>
<p>After the war, Japan, due to the great reduction in its area (in fact, it has not decreased compared to the Japanese territory of seventy years ago, because what it has reduced now is what it has gained from past invasions), and the industry has been restricted, and it has to pay reparations, how to deal with various economic problems is a big headache.</p>
<p>Now it is said that Japan has decided to become the "Switzerland of Asia." Recently, it has also launched a "greening movement." The greening movement is to turn the whole country into a "garden country" in order to attract foreign tourists to visit and exchange for foreign exchange. For this greening movement, Emperor Hirohito even allocated tens of thousands of saplings from his "imperial garden" to promote it.</p>
<p>We are not opposed to Japan becoming the "Switzerland of Asia," if Japan can really become as peaceful as Switzerland in the future; and "greening" is even better, because between the "whitening" of the New World and the "reddening" of the Soviet Union, letting Japan's "greening" be the bridge will be of considerable help to world peace. However, we do not hope that Japan will use the "greening" movement as a cover to attempt to revive its old dreams amidst the confrontation between "whitening" and "reddening."</p>
<h3>"The Merry Widow" – A New Biographical Film</h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>Helen Stephens Marksey was born in 1840 and died in 1916. He was a great inventor of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He applied for registration of 192 patents for his inventions. The first patent application was in 1866. He improved the method of making iron, bending thick iron into a circle for making bombs. The last time was in 1916, when he succeeded in researching hydrocarbons, which contributed greatly to the manufacture of aircraft.</p>
<p>Although he was a scientist, Marksey was not as serious, calm, and inhuman as people imagined. Naturally, he was very serious and calm when he was doing research, but in his family life, he was a very humorous person, creating ten times more jokes than his inventions. For example, he would take his son to shoot the police with bean bullets, or conduct hypnosis experiments on a group of chicks.</p>
<p>Marksey's story has now been made into a movie by Universal Pictures. In the past, biographical films have focused on scientific inventions, but this one only takes his love and family stories. Here, he is not a great inventor but a faithful husband and a humorous father. Hollywood's standard dad, Don Americanchi, and standard wife, Mouna Loa, play Marksey's husband and wife, and child star Bobbed Lystco plays their son. Don't think that turning a great inventor into a clown is something out of nothing. The story of this film is completely based on the memoirs "AGenius In The Family" written by Marksey's son, Pansey, and its authenticity is 100%.</p>
<p>The translated title of this film is "The Merry Widow," which is scheduled to be released at the Majestic Theater on the 27th. It is a unique comedy biographical film.</p>
<p>New Knowledge</p>
<h3>Refrigerant</h3>
<p>— Baigao</p>
<p>Sheldon, an amateur chemist in New York City, USA, was engaged in amateur chemical research when he lived in Brazil ten years ago. He felt that his import and export industry needed a powder that could be used immediately, such as a refrigerant, so he started experimenting and soon discovered that hundreds of chemicals could absorb heat during the reaction. However, these chemicals could not meet the three conditions that are necessary for general application, namely: cheap, harmless, and chemically stable. Then, whenever he had time, he continued his gentle analysis, watching and testing in his home laboratory in Reno de Janeiro. This lasted for eight years, and a total of more than 250 chemicals that were considered useless were discarded. As a result, he solved two of the three major problems: he made several non-toxic and inexpensive cooling substances, but these substances could not remain intact when exposed to air.</p>
<p>Once, he experimented until almost dawn before leaving the laboratory and going to bed. He didn't even bother to put away the product made in this experiment—a cup of mixed powder—but let it slowly absorb moisture from the air and turn into a useless paste. Four hours later, when his spirit and ambition were restored, he walked into the laboratory again, ready to "reorganize." When he reached out to pour out the cup of chemicals, he suddenly found that the contents of the cup were as hard as bones, and he was very excited. He added some water, and the solution became extremely cold!</p>
<p>After calming down a little, Sheldon happened to look at the medicine rack above the experiment table and found traces of a small amount of powdered medicine sprinkled from the top shelf onto the cup on the table. After paying a little attention, he also found that the bottle containing this powder had fallen on the shelf, and the stopper had come off. Obviously, this bottle was knocked over, but who did it? Sleeping soundly near the bottle was his pet monkey, which had unintentionally helped its owner achieve a great purpose. This powdered medicine, which had not been tried before, actually completed his prescription.</p>
<p>Then Sheldon sent samples of his invention to friends all over the world to test its impact under various climates. The results were very satisfactory, and his cooling powder is now on sale in the market. But the author does not know whether it is available in China.</p>
<h3>News Summary</h3>
<p>— Tieyun</p>
<p>It is said that the $10,000 big bill has been decided not to be issued. There are two possible views on this: (1) The US$500 million loan may be available immediately, and the currency can be tightened; (2) After the implementation of the emergency economic measures, prices will tend to fall.</p>
<p>Which one is right? We can't guess.</p>
<p>A fake inspector general nominated himself to be called "Forgiveness." When he was on trial, he shouted "Forgiveness" to the judge. It can be seen that this person's conscience has not been completely lost. However, there are too many people whose "treachery" has not been exposed, but who have already been "forgiven."</p>
<p>"Second landlords" are now the "Mayor of Greater Shanghai." The "gold bar" law they have set, even the mayor dare not say "no"!</p>
<p>The second landlord at No. 8, Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, forced the third tenant to jump into the Huangpu River. These are tragedies created by the "gold bar" law. Even the chief bandit knows to celebrate his mother's birthday. His "banditry" also has a "way." Excuse me! Excuse me! However, it is said that Huang Jiayin and his gang of robbers are all members of the "Zhonghe Party." I don't know if they have received any training. They are so disobedient to party discipline and party program.</p>
<p>More than a dozen cars of the latest model, and the roads are already too crowded to walk, the order prohibiting the import of cars has been issued. This is what is called "control."</p>
<p>A military officer said: Now, those running solo on the streets are all "major generals" and "colonels." He also said that many military wives are setting up stalls. The torment of life is terrifying this year!</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Guan wanted to follow, but Xiao Shen stopped her, and Rong'er, who was less than five years old, also cried and pushed away Jin Aili's hand, wanting her mother to hold him. At this time, the tense emotions expressed by everyone had also aroused a kind of premonitory fear in his little mind.</p>
<p>"Come! Little brother, I'll hold you!" Xiao Shen put on a smiling face, trying to tease Rong'er. He always felt a little uncomfortable and sour in his heart when he heard the intimate address that Old Zhu used for the young woman when he left just now. Now he wanted to take advantage of this gap as much as possible and compete with Old Zhu. But Rong'er refused to cooperate, only hugging his mother tightly, not even turning his head back.</p>
<p>Lan picked him up herself and gave Xiao Shen a look as if to thank him.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hu, let's go! I'll lead the way for you! Japanese planes are really coming!" Xiao Shen pointed to the sky. Sure enough, the sound of the plane was getting louder and louder, and it seemed that there were more than a dozen of them.</p>
<p>The red-nosed old man had been looking at Jin Aili with a sly look for a long time. When Lan really followed Xiao Shen out of the long glass window, he gave her a knowing smile, and regardless of whether the other party responded, he rushed forward and grabbed her hand, rushing out.</p>
<p>"Miss Jin, let's go too!" he said in a low voice, feeling very excited inside.</p>
<p>Jin Aili did not dare to offend him, only struggled to break free of her hand, and then silently followed him out. Xu Shaoming and A Shi, who were rolling like a ball, caught up behind him. Old Xu was carrying an extremely fat briefcase in his left hand, and was wiping the sweat on his face and neck with a towel in his right hand. A Shi was carrying a not-so-small leather suitcase on his shoulder, and the weight seemed very heavy. Behind A Shi was also a Cantonese maid with long braids and wooden clogs.</p>
<p>The air-raid shelter was not far away. After five or six minutes, Xu's family had all gathered inside. Xiao Shen worked very hard to grab a long bench by the wall, and wiped it for a long time with his white hands before he carefully helped the young woman over, letting her and Rong'er sit comfortably, and then hurriedly took out a very delicate cigarette case from his pocket and carefully handed over a cigarette.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I don't smoke!" Lan smiled reluctantly. She was only thinking about Fei Fei in her heart, and did not pay attention to the dishonest air that was floating on Xiao Shen's face.</p>
<p>Xiao Shen put the cigarette on the corner of his mouth and smoked it, while also secretly looking at that pretty face that had turned pale with anxiety. Fatty Xu was the last one to step into the air-raid shelter. Seeing that there were no seats elsewhere, he glanced over and sat to the left of Xiao Rong. (2) (6)</p>
<h3>Cheering for the Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Mengbo</p>
<p>Second Time Affairs Couplet</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that Chief Chen mentioned morale, soldier treatment, and strengthening conscription at the Third Plenary Session, saying that if treatment could be improved immediately, morale would be boosted. Deputy Minister Gu said that the people should also implement general mobilization to help combat. Today, I will pick up the main points and compose them into a couplet:</p>
<p>Treatment urgently needs adjustment, at a time when salaries are like cassia and rice like pearls, no wonder soldiers' morale is still full of worries;</p>
<p>Conscription still needs to be strengthened, in this time of war and chaos, it is pitiful that the people's hearts have not been mobilized.</p>
