<h3>有關行憲十大法規　立法程序全部完成　全國監委將有二二三人</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕有關行憲十大法規，經立法院近一週不分節日，不分假期，愼奉討論後，已於卅下午八時全部完成立法程序。當孫院長宣布此一艱鉅工作已於同人努力下底於完成時，全院咸以熱烈掌聲，俟國府四月一日明令公布後，即將成為實施憲政最重要決規。</p>
<p>此一法規，其中四種係選舉罷免法，六種為組織法。國大組織法。國大組織法首先於廿五日完成，國代選舉罷免法及總統，副總統選舉罷免法，則於廿八日通過。卅日上午繼續討論立委選舉罷免法，內長張厲生列席，說明編製人口統計表及劃分選舉區經過，承認欲得一準確統計數字確非易事，渠本人對此並不堅持已見，對劃區事，張氏說明奉命辦理此事限期僅有三日，難免不有錯訛之處，極願接受各方意見，繼即逐條討論。主要修正之點，為立委候選人提名簽署人由五千人減為三千人，原定本屆立委為下屆當然候選人決議刪去。對於現任文武職官員不得在其管轄所或任所之選人一點，鄧公立玄等亦各提出寶貴意見，決議此類人員欲為候選人者，須於選舉期前五個月辭職。此外，關於職業代表，孫九錄等主張職業代表候選人以各該職業之從火速質員為限，以防操縱假冒，亦以多數通過。關於立委罷免問題，若干立委認　讀罷　次數不應太多，孫院長亦認立委不致有何為非作歹情事，限制聲請罷免次數，可防行政當局干涉立法，全案於十二時一刻完成立法程序。</p>
<p>下行討論監委選舉罷免法草案，不滿一小時，全案廿四條即全部通過，該法規定全國有監委二百廿三人，由各省市議會，蒙古，西藏地方議會及華僑團體選舉之，每省得選五人，直轄市二人，蒙古各盟共八人，西藏八人，僑胞八人。監委選舉機構，由選舉委會制改為選舉監督制。</p>
<h3>行政院新組織法　規定設十四部三個委會　取消糧食部及最高法院</h3>
<p>繼即以飛快速度討論五院組織法草案，其中最重大之變更，為政院取消社會部，改勞動部，糧食部亦取消，經濟部改工商部，司法行政部改屬政院，最高法院取消，考試院設銓敍部及考選處，監察院所屬監察使署及監察使取消，審計部改稱審計總處。</p>
<p>根據新政院組織法，政院將有十四個部，三個委會，各部會首長均為政務委員，並置不管部會政務委員五至七人，十四個部即內政，外交，國防，財政，敎育，司法行政，農林，工商，交通，郵電，勞動，水利，地政，衛生部。取消社會部之建議，鐘氏指出社會部過去對農工福利過於忽視，應將該部取消，改設勞動部。新立委吳聞天首次發言，調社會部對其應做之事皆未辦到，而僅重視集團結婚等皮毛工作，難免不有非　非馬之嫌，表決時，以最大多數通過取消社會部，改設勞動部。關於司法行政部隷屬問題，憲法法規委會開會時，將該部劃入司法院管轄。孫院長報告政協及國大開會討論此一問題經過，並根據憲法詳加解釋，認該部不應屬於政院，籍免與憲法抵觸。林彬等則提出司法獨立理由，並根據憲法八十二條之規定，主張司法行政部應屬司法院，決議該部仍屬政院。芮逸夫發言，建議將蒙藏委會改為邊政部，趙珮附議，孫院長亦提出二中全會曾有此一決議，惟表決時獲票過少，仍維持原案。此外，初審時有人建議將資委會併入工商部，亦有主張改稱重工業部者，現仍獨立存在。又參事處機構決取消，僅設參事八人至十人，政院組織法全文十六條，自提謂至通過，歷時不及兩小時，可出速矣。</p>
<p>立法院　設十七個委會</p>
<p>政院組織法草案通過後，其他四種組織法，即陸積迅速通過，其中立院組織法，前後僅討論二十五分鍾，主要修正為立院委會增至十七個，即內政，外交，國防，經濟，財政，預算，敎育，文化，農林，交通，社會，地政，邊政，僑務，民法，刑法，商事法，法制等十七個委會。</p>
<p>司法院　設大法官會議</p>
<p>討論司法院組織法時，大法官制度引起一度激辦，憲法法規委會審查時，決定司法院設大法官會議，以大法官九人組織之，行使解釋憲法並統一解釋法令之權，該會開會時，互推一人為主席，司法院長應列席。大法官任期定為六年，其資格以法律另定之。討論時，孫院長等認憲法對大法官任期並無規定，司法院長是否為當然大法官固成問題，然司法院長若不出席大法官會議，對於法理似有未合，劉克　認司法院長若為大法官，似有行政干涉之嫌，決議組織法中對大法官任期一點不予明文規定，留待他日司法院解釋，至司法院長是否為大法官，會中並未規定，僅決定「大法官會議開會時，以司法院長為主席」，大法官人數則定為九人。又最高法院將予取消，而於司法院中分設民事庭，刑事庭，行政裁判庭·公務員懲戒委會及司法行政部·將來上訴案件，即由民刑各庭處理，此亦為一大改革。</p>
<p>考試院　組織無大更動</p>
<p>新考試院組織法，與現行組織法無大更動，提據新組織法，該院將設考為戒　委員十一人，任期六年，考試院會議，以院長·副院長及考選委員組織之，統籌有關考試事項，考試院下設銓敘部及考選處，考試院長及副院長之任期為六年，國防會原草案有代以務員保障委會之設法規定會，審查時予以取消。</p>
<p>監察院　取消監察使署</p>
<p>最後討論監院組織法草案時，已下午七時半，各立委一面草草進食茶點，一面逐條討論，毫無倦容，最重要更動之處為將監察使署及監察使取消，孫院長指出立院及監院為民意機關，監院等於外國之上院，並非官廳，監委由各地民意機關選出，當不受政府之任免。彭醇士反對設置監察使，其理由為身為臨委者，人人皆有彈劾，糾舉之職權，不必另設所謂監察使，決議瘵條文改為監察委員得分赴各地巡迴監察，行使彈勘，糾舉之職權。組織法中另一重要修正，為審計部改為審計總處，監院建議成立調查處，審查時，決議不予設立。</p>
<p>全部法規於掌聲中完成立法程序後，記者羣即至主席台，請孫院長就此事發表簡單談話，孫於連日會議後（孫亦為憲政實施促進會會長），殊為疲憊，與記者談話時，以手撫額稱：「連日開會，困頓不堪，立院同人於極短時期內完成第一難鉅工作，努力精神產，殊堪嘉　」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕靑年黨全體常委十五人，昨日下午在左舜生宅舉行座談會，就參加政府問題，廣泛交換意見。左氏會後接見記者稱：靑年黨府委及政院名單是否一次提出，抑先後提出，尚在考慮，人選亦在研究中。卅日僅交換意見，並無結論，卅日僅交換意見，並無結論，卅一日召開常會，當能有所決定。左氏並謂：靑年黨希望就開放地方　政樹一點與政府取得諒解後，然後再提名單，但此點未作最後決定，將來或將再度晉京協商。以行政院之改組而言，靑年黨希望能多參加政治性之部，而少參加技術性之部，便如水利。衛生等部，因政府之技術人才已甚充分，不必求之其他黨派，同時，改組政府本身，即為政治性的，對於外傳靑年黨將發動千人參加政府一節，左氏堅決否認。記者以「交通恢復」之解釋，詢之左氏，答謂：個人之意見，認為需全國每一條鐵路均打通後，始能與中共恢復和談。</p>

<h3>驛憲政實施促進會之期望</h3>
<p>憲政賓施促進會之常務，研究，考察，曁宣傳四委員會，已一併於廿九月在首都舉行成立大會，開始執行其對於促進憲政之任務了。這四種委員會，是國民大會閉幕後，為準備實施憲政而設立的機關，不僅其所負的任務重大，其工作的完善與否，對於中國今後實施的憲政，有着非常密切齣關係；而且從其構成的成份而論，又是國民黨，社會民主黨，靑年黨曁社會賢達所組織的，不啻是一個派黨會議，和普遍機構的性質，截然不同，所以我們老百姓，今天看到各黨派的代表曁社會賢達，聚首於一堂，從容討諭實施憲政所必需的準備一作，並將審議立法院所提交關於行憲的一切法規，對於憲政實施促進會，實在抱着極大的期望，誠如蔣主席政電該會稱；『完備之憲法雖已制成，但將來實旅之如何能達到確實，順利，無窒礙，無糾紛，乃屬當前最重要之準備工作。』『尙賴該會羣力，共同邁進，方能如期完成此偉大之事業。』</p>
<p>中華民國憲法，於去年十二月廿五日起實施，所以今年的一年，是名符其實的「憲政準備年，」也就是國民黨結束訓政到實施憲政的過渡時期。這一年可以說是最重要的一年，中國民主政治的前途，完全要看這一年的準備工作是否充分！但是自憲法公佈迄今，忽然已三月有餘，準，我們應該如何充分利用這八個多月的時間，完全準備行憲的艱巨工作，實在是目前最迫切的問題，憲政實施促進會成立伊始，加以準備工作，端緒紛繁，欲在八個多月的時間完成這樣偉大的任務，實在是一件極困難的事情。我們願就所見，略述一二，聊供憲　政實施促進會諸公之參考。</p>
<p>第一，依照中華民國憲法所規定之準備實施程序，在立法方面，也要完成下列各項工作：（一）現行法令之與憲支相抵觸者，應迅速分別予以修正或廢止：（二）在憲法公佈後的三個月內，須制定五種法律並公佈之：（一）關於國民大會之組織及國民大會代表之選舉曁罷免：（二）關於總統副總統之選舉及罷免：（三）關於立法委員之選舉及罷免：（四）關於監察委員之選舉及罷免：（五）關於五院之組織。這些立法的工作，雖屬於立法院的職權範圍之內，但是如何督促立法院如期完成上述法律？立法制定上述法規究應採取何種原則？這些都是憲政實施促進會的工作。而我們檢討一下最近立法院的製法工作，已通過的法律，已有國民大會組織法，國民大會代表選舉及罷免法，總統副總統選舉及罷免法，尚有好幾種法律，仍未起草，而截至今日為止，從憲法公佈之日起計算，已是整整的三個月了，末能完全依照憲法之規定如期完成其制法工作，是不可諱言的事實。至於這些法律的內容如何？其所採取的辦法是否切實易行？當有縝密加以研究的必要，憲政實施促進會，雖不負實際上的責任，但仍應加以審議，務使這些法規，更能適應現實環境，更加容易實行。</p>
<p>第二，所謂憲政，不能完全依靠憲法或法律，而最重要的，還在政府與人民如何運用：換句話說，卽使有盡善盡美的憲法和良好的法律，如果政府不能行憲施法，人民不能遵憲守法，那末所謂憲政，還是紙上談兵。以以關於憲政的實施，除了在法理上應作充分的準備而外，在國民的心理上，尙需要幹一番革新的工作，以培養民主的氣氛，使全國人民均能歡迎民主，愛好民主！唯有如此，中國的政治能走上眞正民主的坦途。否則憲法是憲法，政治是政治，憲與政脫了節，有名無實，充其量以僅足以點綴聊以自欺欺人而已。是以我們一再主張，這一年的過渡時期，是我國上下學習民主的時期，我們寗願按步就班，逐漸學習逐漸進步，切不可好高驚遠，企圖一鳴驚人，剛在學習走路就想與他人賽跑，因為世界各國民主政治發展的過程，無一不是自然發展的結果，我且先自我檢討一下，中國人民的政治哲學，從古以來，一直崇尚禮治而輕視法治的，民主思想萌芽雖早，但為因襲的傳統觀念所束縛，未能自由發展；乃成為民主政治比較落後的國家，國父孫中山先生有鑒於此，故有訓政時期的發明。所謂訓政，一言以蔽之，就是訓導人民學習民主，但是國民黨自北伐成功統一全國以來，訓政了二十餘年，因為內憂外患的交迫，以致未能達成訓政時期所預定的目的：但時至今日，不論是世界潮流所趨，或是國內人心所歸，訓政不能不結束，憲政不能不實行。此時此際，實為我國人民學習民主的最後一時期，應該格外珍貴。傳在本年十二月廿五日開始行憲之前，能作充分的準備，以免事敗垂成！</p>
<p>第三，憲政實施促進會，是由國民黨靑年黨民社黨曁社會賢達共同組織的，可以視為黨派會議，而且我們看了各黨派的委員，都是各該黨派的優秀份子。我們若欲期望這個會能完成其任務以促進中國憲政的實施，則我們必先希望其本身，就是充滿了民主精神的團體，不問其是否負有實際上的責任，抑或僅是研究和考察的機構，但是終須能以民主團體的資態，出現全國人民的眼前，做人民的模範，做人民的榜樣。但是我們所謂民主精神，最重要的還在各黨派的領袖均具有民主政治家的風度，虛懷若谷，無偏見，不自私而能從遠處看，為大處打算。凡是有利於實施憲政的事情，不論黨派的意見如何？終是表示贊成，並協助其成功：反之，凡有害中國民主發展的事情，不論其如何有利於黨，仍應堅決反對，能如此，中國民主政治始能有光明燦爛的前途，黨派的紛爭就不致成為民主的障礙。但是我們正視目前的情形，使我們的內心，不能不有所戒懼，終覺得有若干政黨的領袖，在沒有作最後決定之前，優柔寡斷，躊躇不決；在決定之後，仍是患得患失；欲前不進，這實在是當前最不可樂觀的現象。姑以改組政府而論，三個月的時候已經虛度了，而各黨派參加政府的名單，至今還沒有提出，使我們不能不引為遺憾！</p>
<p>要之，憲政實施促進會，是過渡時期內的黨派會議，應該充分發揮其作用，以達成其準備憲政的偉業！</p>

<h3>外長會議議程決定　德主要問題限期結束討論　賠償委員會主席陳述工作困難情形</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿九日電〕四外長今日在美國務卿馬歇爾壓迫之下，經短時問會議後，同意於下星期一開始之兩次築議中，討論兩大問題，則（一）德國成為經濟單位包括賠償在內，並檢討工業標準包括軍事性工業之限制；（二），德國臨時政府之形式與範圍。以上兩項問題至遲於四月二日即須完成討諭，倘不能商定共同基礎，則就德國問題而論，會議之命運已注定。權威人士稱，馬歇爾集中最緊急的各項德國問題之策略倘無進步，則有充分理由相信渠將束裝返國。反之，下星期初之澈底努力，倘顯露若干建設性的遠景，則馬卿於會議繼續進行時或將另行提出限期，解決其他各爭點。此外四外長並任命特別小組會，負責討論次要問題（德政治民生化，肅淸納粹，人口之移殖，流亡人民等問題）於四月三日以前草成折令。該會美國代表為馬卿之經濟顧問馬遜，法國代表亞爾方，英盎國勞白森及蘇聯索柯羅夫斯基上將。閣於統一德國問題，成立協議之各項遠景均不見佳。聞美代表團願意就德國現行生產撥充賠價一點，對蘇聯有所讓步，但以蘇聯對於德國政權問題表示妥協為交換條件。蘇聯將否接受此神妥協，殊成疑問。</p>
<p>〔路義社莫斯科廿九日電〕德國問題之外次會議今晨開會時，由盟國賠償會主席魯埃失報告該會行政上之困難，渠指出會員國政府對賠償物分配之進展均有不滿，會員國均希望能迅速恢復賠償物資之遞送，若使目前之局勢綱續延長，將使波茨坦協定規定之賠償計劃完全失敗。渠建議使賠償會直屬外長會議，可直接向外長會提供意見，不必再經由德國明管會。渠並指出關於緊急支付賠償之規定一再被破壞，波茨坦協定之原意，已為之完全漠視。渠謂波茨坦賠償政策不能實行之原因，第一在人人皆知之政治命令，第二為不甚為人知之行政命令，後者且　前者更為重要。</p>
<h3>英蘇談判修改盟約</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿九日電〕蘇聯代表維辛斯基戈隆斯基，英大使彼得森及助理外次哈台，已於星期四在蘇聯外交部舉行修正英蘇同盟條約之首次談判，昨日雙方又曾舉行第二次會議。英發言人表示希望談判得於莫斯科外長會結束前完成。據悉雙方對於修正盟約之主要建議如下：蘇聯方面希望修正盟約的第四條，即德國發動侵略時英蘇實施互助之規定，俾使此項義務不必依賴聯合國機構規定之義務，英國方面則要求將盟約有效期二十年延長為五十年。按此項談判乃英外相貝文與史達林本星期初會議之結果，條約倘若商獲成議，則將在貝文離莫斯科前再度與史達林會面時提出。</p>
<h3>審議對奧和約完成報告書</h3>
<p>奧境德產問題尚待討論</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿九日電〕，四國外决會議本日已完成其向四國外長會議所當提出之報告書，內稱，對奧和的共計卅五條，業已商得同意者廿四條，尚有七條討論未完畢，定於四月一日繼續加以討論。至於最困難之問題即奧境德產之定義問題，外次會議尚未擬就報告書。</p>
<h3>法蘇要人聯歡</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿九日電〕法駐蘇大使賈德魯夫婦，今晚設席歡宴蘇聯外長莫洛托夫夫婦及法外長杜皮爾夫婦，並到蘇外次維辛斯基夫婦·古塞夫夫婦·德境蘇置總司令索柯爾夫斯基元帥。德境法軍總司令柯尼格將軍。法代表繆維爾。亞爾芳暨哈松盎等人。</p>
<h3>慕尼黑美電臺遭人破壞　俄語節目竟播送南美</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕助理國務卿班登透露：國務院派駐慕尼黑之特別顧問電知國務院，謂慕尼黑之美國轉播電台，被人將機鈕調轉，使原擬對蘇聯廣播之電波，轉向南美。當局現已澈查此案，俾免致再有此等事件發生。慕尼黑轉播電台共有天綫六道，共中二道係供對蘇廣播用者，其中一道正用以試騐向蘇廣播之新波長，在三月十七日至廿五日間，竟失去效用，始知被人破壞，已於三月廿五日予以糾正。</p>
<h3>魯爾區德人　繼續飢饉示威</h3>
<p>〔路透社魯爾一區陶特蒙廿九日電〕今日此間又有德人因糧荒而遊行示威，當地礦工工會秘書鄶爾霍夫向示威者致辭，建議發動整個英軍區內之各工會舉行集團飢饉示威一天，示威者由當地英軍司令威爾遜少校接見，表示小麥供應日內可趨好轉。陶特蒙糧食局長表示麵粉可於週末遲到，工廠及消費者代表可出席下星期二之市議會會議，提出糧食意見</p>
<h3>土耳其總理斥責共產主義</h3>
<p>〔中央社安加拉廿九日專電〕土耳其總理柏克頃向伊斯坦堡大學生發表動人之演說，攻擊左右兩派極端主義者，並極力主張中庸之道。彼攻擊極右派之泛土耳其主義，該主義係主張統一土爾庫·安納士里亞·蘇聯·中亞細亞與中國西北，成一大土耳其國。柏氏稱：種族國家主義，完全違反民主，實為非理性者與帝國主義者·彼論及共產主義稱：共產黨在每一國度，均正在腐蝕其國家機構，彼等以民主社會主義糖衣，掩飾自己搗毀民族自覺心。吾人應防憊與外國合作之人民。全土耳其人應應以國家統一與完整為國家之基本原則，共產主義否定民族主義，而種族主義又誇大民族主義，故取有效之補救，乃明確之民族主義感。土耳其人非自私自利藐視他人者，反之，土耳其國民應支持國際組織，為文明國家團結而努力。</p>
<h3>反美活動調查會證明　美共黨聽命蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕衆議院「反美活動調查委員會」今日披露可證美國共產黨為蘇聯政府間諜之證據，其中有共產國際於一九二七年所頒令美國共產黨反抗美國帝國主義在中國從事之反革命戰爭之命令，總計經披露之莫斯科所頒影響美國共黨活動之指令，計有九十二通。眾院反美活動調查委員主席湯麥斯向記者率直表示，就此次發表之報告書觀，可證美國之共黨無疑為首斯科之第五縱隊。報告書內有謂：「吾人應付共產主義時，應認淸此乃受某一外國政府指揮之世界革命運動」。其列舉之證據，有共產黨，前共產黨人員發表之文件，及史達林之言論等，其中所述共產國際於一九二七年向美國共產黨所發之指令，述及該黨急應向美帝國主義者對中國及尼加拉瓜之干涉及反革侖戰爭，從事最大的戰鬥。眾院反美活動調查委員會之報告書，直指美國共黨爲指揮世界革命某一外國政府之間諜，而本年二月在倫敦舉行之英國共產黨大會，實爲共產國際之會議。報告書並曰：在十五至二十年前，共產黨僅恃實力軟弱之蘇聯政府為賴，其活動不必重視，當能以民主方法使其自然淘汰。迨至一九四七年，始見此一極權主義之橋頭堡，已深入勞工運動，政府，政黨，報紙，電臺，電影，學校，教會及各社會團體，由於共黨人員紀律嚴格，在民衆團體中握有重要地位，並以世界主要強國之蘇聯政府爲倚靠，因此共黨之勢力，已超過其人數之比例。美國之共產運動，係依據蘇聯共產黨所須之紀律而活動，其目標在廢止美國現下之經濟民主政府，設立蘇聯埃獨裁政體。美國共黨之力量，如實行全部動員，並由一強力外國給予重大協助，足能嚴重破壞美國之經濟社會生活，甚至破壞美國軍隊之效能。美國之共產黨始終為莫斯科所控制世界性共產機構之完整的一部，無條件聽從莫斯科之命令，並以其人力物力供蘇聯政府或共產國際之支配，奉令在世界任何部份活動。報告　又曰：以五　文字出版之蘇聯「新時代」雜誌，已被承認爲共產國際之繼承者，其社評被世界各國共黨，奉爲格言。</p>
<h3>調查共黨經費將請國會撥付</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日合衆電〕社魯門為實施其肅淸共產黨及同路人在政府任職，所需經費，不久將請國會撥付，聯邦政府公務員忠實調查所需費用約二千五百萬元。</p>
<h3>美反共意識日濃</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓卅日電〕據悉，美國抵制共產主義之準備工作在過去數日中已日益加強。據非官方人士之意見，認為美政府實已公佈，在希臘與土耳其之外，德國及朝鮮亦為抵制共產主義之主要陳綫。代理國務卿艾契遜曾宣稱：姑認為蘇聯對統一朝鮮一點并無與美國合作之意，則美國之唯一辦法，僅有使韓南日趨繁熒，而使蘇聯佔領區相形見絀。負責佔領區事宜之助理陸軍部長希爾特林昨日會告撥款委員會稱：美國須與蘇聯在德國繼續從事經濟戰爭至少達三年之久。美國民意現正堅決擁護國務院及國會之意見。政府抵制共產主義之方法乃以事實證明，佔領區人民在民主政體之下有如何更為優良之生活。現有一切跡象表示曾以削减捐稅自任之共和黨員，亦將不惜任何代價擁護杜魯門總統援助希土之計劃。反對杜魯門計劃之大部份爭議均為形式而已。</p>
<h3>共和黨議員孟特建議　杜史兩巨頭會議　杜魯門謂目前無此種意向</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕共和黨議員孟特今日在衆院外交委員會促請杜魯門總統與蘇聯史達林元帥親自會晤，藉以淸除共產蘇聯與民主各國間之歧見。但杜魯門總統向記者表示，渠最近無意參加任何強國會議，目前各國領袖舉行談判，恐無用處。孟特則稱，余覺惟有經由此種會談，吾人始能對協議範圍獲得一淸晰輪廓，該項協議位茲國際關係緊急時期各大國間應予成立。美國政府四億元援助希土計劃無異瀕於面向共產主義國際進軍邊綠之行動。對於類似情形如伊朗，朝鮮，中國，以及其他則將處於類似局勢各國如挪威，瑞典，芬蘭，義大利，黎巴嫩，埃及等，亦常加以考慮。孟特繼稱，組遏共產主義侵略勢力之適當地點應在莫斯科，且對下列各事成立諒解：（一）禁止生產與使用原子彈之有效的國際保障；（二）聯合國機構保障獨立國家自治之特權；（三）戰後世界流行之疆界綫與對外政策。</p>
<h3>杜特次尼斯羣島　今交還希臘</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典廿九日電〕杜特坎尼斯　島將於本月卅一日交還希臘，屆時希臘政府及議會均將推派代表參加儀式。希臘憲兵已於昨日在各島登陸，島上居民歡迎頗爲熱烈，希臘本部與此等島嶼問將於四月中旬開闢商業航空綫。</p>
<h3>原子彈餘威猶在</h3>
<p>五百餘人尚在治療中</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿九日電〕據訊：在廣島受原子彈傷害之”人，刻尚有五百五十七人在醫院治療，迄今距被炸日已十九個月有餘矣。原先受傷者共五萬二千人，然大多數受傷者經一個月之治療後，即告恢復，其他則經二三六個月之治療不等。受傷者均係在離彈落處中心一或二公里之地區內。</p>
<h3>美艦隊將駛北歐　參加者爲美國最新式艦艇</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕美海軍部宣布，將於六月間派遺新主力艦及最近代化之航空母艦兩艘至北歐海面作訓練遊弋。東大西洋及地中海區美海軍司令柯諾萊上將謂生力艦乃「紐傑賽」號及「威斯康新」號，航空母艦乃「倫道爾夫」號及「埃賽克斯」號或「基賽傑」號。此行將記問之港口，有撲資茅斯，威茅斯，普列茅斯，葛林威樞，伍爾維樞，羅西斯，奧斯陸，哥德堡及哥本哈根。「紐傑賽」號及「威斯康新」號排水量均為四萬五千噸，裝有十六吋砲九尊，五吋砲十二尊，速率三十五浬，兩母艦排水量各二萬七千噸，每艘可載飛機百架。</p>
<h3>美發意測騐　贊同援助希土</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿九日電〕美國最近民意測騐結果，證明輿情大部份贊同社魯門總統之援助希臘計劃，但以希臘問題不先提出聯合國檢討為憾。測騐結果贊成對希臘財政援助者佔百分之六十，但不贊成派潰軍事顧間團前往該兩國訓練軍隊，並期望美國貸款之運用，由美國各專家當場加以監視。</p>
<h3>華萊士將訪歐</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約廿九日電〕美國前任商務部長華萊士本日正式宣稱：本人將於四月間，前往英法兩國，可望四月十六日行抵巴黎，將晋謁法國總統歐禮和，內閣總理賴瑪迪埃及其他法國政治界。此外本人並將前往瑞典及丹麥國京城一行云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社聖路易三十日電〕據海軍　部長福萊斯泰今日宣佈：「美國應予欲保持自由制度之諸國，以政治，經濟，及如屬必要時之軍事援助。」福萊斯泰涉及杜魯門總統之援助希土計劃時稱：如歐亞非三洲為一　極權國支配，則「西半球」亦處於難以抵抗此等國家之形勢。」渠又稱：「但當海洋保持開放時，則對此等國家之獲得控制歐亞非三洲，當屬困難。」海軍部長又稱：美國現有一航空母艦機動部隊在太平洋上，另一在大西洋上，得隨時出動。</p>
<h3>英將請賴依召開聯合圖全體大會　俾討論巴勒斯坦問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕官方人士本日證實，英國即將要求聯合國機精秘書長赖依，召開聯合國全體大會特別會議，俾討論巴勒斯坦問題。據稱，英國現已放棄任命巴勒斯坦問題特別審員會之概念，是項會議，可能於五月問舉行。英國始不致向聯合國機構提出任何計劃，將由聯合國大會起草對於巴勒斯坦今後政治地位之確切建議云。</p>
<h3>秘書廳徵詢中法蘇意見</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖卅日電〕據悉：聯合國秘書廳應英國代表團之請，已非正式與中法及蘇聯三國接治召開聯合國大會討諭巴勒斯坦問題之可能性。截至目前為止，尚未自該三國代表團獲得任何一國之答復。</p>
<h3>飛越地獄之門看火靈聖母巢穴　航空公司做投機生意</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社冰島京城廿九日電〕冰島南面凡斯曼火山島今日大燦發，濃姻上沖數千呎，溶石亦甚高，整個火山被雲柱包圍，不見天日。該島並無居民，故尚無死傷報告。冰島各航空公司以此種火山爆發，爲百年來所未有，特開辦火山游覽班，其廣告曰：「飛過地獄之門，看火靈聖母之巢穴」。好奇者趨之若驚。</p>

<p>結果不分勝負悻悻而別</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿九日電〕此問「旭報」最近發表一文，指斥社會黨議員台麥爾與盜賣酒類案件有關，台麥爾閱報後怒不可抑，昨在國民大會休息室與該報院總編輯即激進社會黨議員巴斯蒂相值，當即上前大興問罪之師，遂發生口角。台麥爾手批巴斯蒂之頰，並提議定期決鬥，乃於本日午後舉行。二人相距廿五步之遙，均身御大衣，頭戴帽子，發槍凡二次，均未命中，二人於決鬥後仍拒不握手言和。</p>

<h3>蘇聯饑荒嚴重農民餓死者多</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿九日電〕熟悉蘇聯情况之法國要員今日談稱：最近數週蘇聯四區農民死於飢饉者，數以千計，該四區為烏克蘭、下伏爾加，上伏爾加及西伯利亞西部。飢荒之由來蓋因去年蘇聯歐洲部份產麥區旱災嚴重，而西伯利亞多數小麥收成又遭淫雨沖毀。先是，莫斯科來電引官方聲明，亦稱全國荒旱，致糧食局勢極端嚴重。去年耶誕節時，情况已趨惡化，蘇聯政府開始屠宰大批家書，為數空前。理由有二：一因家畜缺乏芻秣，奄奄垂斃，二則利用獸肉可供人類消費。結果，蘇聯各城市中食肉雖較往歲為多，但戰後家畜數目遠居正常狀態之下，减少極巨。估計蘇聯家畜冬季被宰者達總數三分之一。人民食糧亦感匱乏，但又不能向外界訴述，逐使局勢每况愈下。蘇聯領袖均信值茲國際大局緊張之時，如若油露國內弱點，必將敗壞計劃。故蘇聯甚至無法乞人援助云。</p>

<p>美國今日正在大規模地進行一種戰爭，它的結局對於我們生活的影響，其重要性不减於珍珠港事變所引起的戰爭。我們在這次戰爭中所用的武器，不是戰艦飛機或原子炸彈，而是光彩奪目的新式洗車，冰箱，機器工具，白報紙和一切製造品。</p>
<p>在這次商戰中，我們的敵人，就是第二次世界大戰的其他戰勝國。戰場是在拉丁美洲，面積凡八百萬方哩，這義並沒有受到戰事損失，現款估計有七十億元，富有資源和商業機會。在到處愛貿易條約，強權政治和勢力範圍等阻礙的世界中，拉丁美洲是唯一的自由市場，在這裏我們可以和我們的敵人自由競爭。</p>
<p>大戰期間</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰中，英蘇兩國政府相約在拉丁美洲合作購買物資。他們共同購買玻里維亞的錫，阿根廷的肉類，巴西的橡皮，智利的銅和其他戰爭物資。他們至少是把物價控制着，不使它暴跳起來。可是當戰事結束的時候，合作購買協定也同時終止了，各國又只管自顧自了。</p>
<p>立刻，玻里維亞向美國索取較高的錫價，接着阿根廷通知玻里維亞，必須以錫，錫及橡皮售與阿根廷，否則停止給糧食。</p>
<p>國際貿易並不是找出誰有貨物，而設法去購買它，這麽一回事；同樣，在世界市　場中出售貨物，也不是把貨物供應於市場如此簡單的事情。現在是由各國政府從事買賣的；交易不復是出售什麽東西或多少代價的問題，而是有什麽樣的政治關係。公平的競爭給高唱「自由貿易」的國家打消了。</p>
<p>一九四五年美國曾在墨西哥會議允許協助拉丁美洲各國實行工業化，而以美洲各國間自由貿易爲交換條件。美國供給它們以借款及工業設備，並協助它們設立工廠，滿冀拉丁美洲各國政府允許商人得在正當的競爭下自由交易。但是歐洲各國忽視了這些商人而和它們的政府進行交易。</p>
<p>南美現况</p>
<p>因此，美國商人向拉丁美洲購買原料時，發覺當政府已和歐洲各國簽訂貿易合同，使私人製造商無置喙餘地，弄得美國商人一籌莫展。因爲私人企業，無論怎樣龐大，終究不能和外國政府或外國政府支持下的另一私人企業抗衡。在此商戰中，歐洲商人和他們的政府駢肩作戰，儘量利用政治壓力，軍事諜報和神聖的外交錦囊。</p>
<p>美國不但須和拉丁美洲的各國政府個別競爭，而且在阿根廷更遇到了集體的競爭對手。英，法，丹，荷各國為使價格固定起見，正擬相約共同購買阿根廷的脂肪和油類，以抵制貝隆選擇主顧待善價而沽的政策</p>
<p>英蘇策略</p>
<p>英國在戰時所受的商業上的犧牲，沒有一個聯合國家比它更大了。一九四三年英國的出口額祇及到一九三八年數字的四分之一。英國的主要工業已被炸毀，國外投資已經出賣或抵押，以購買戰爭物資，商船大部分已沉入海底。英國所需的原料幾乎完全從外國輸入。在此情形下，英國欲以公正的條件和美洲工業國競爭，恐怕是不可能的事。</p>
<p>蘇聯當然集中其貿易活動於政府的西半球買賣機構，造成蘇聯的經濟勢力圈，而反映於共產黨在拉丁美洲的團體的勢力日益膨脹。</p>
<p>統制政策</p>
<p>在戰事期間，美國的鄰國不能得到必需的製造品，於是開始自行製造。各國政府鑒於它們的出品不能和美國貨競爭，於是築起關稅壁壘並採取其他保護政策。墨西哥宣布新工業品免稅出口，並已將紡織品輸往美洲其他各國，以與美國競爭。巴西從美國那裏學會了製造驅逐艦，坦克車和運貨車，現在巳能自行製造汽車，飛機和其他工業品，而不再向美國購置了。阿根廷採行輪入許可制，在目前需重要美國貨時，便簽發輪入許可證，但是阿根廷政府可隨時拒發這些許可證，而發給貝隆總統所認為政治上有利的其他國家。秘魯也採行輸入許可制，哥惀比亞則禁止用美元奮侈品。整個西半球的拉丁美洲各國政府對於國民經濟漸漸採取嚴格的統制，好像世界上擁護自由貿易的只賸美國一國了。</p>
<p>墨西哥會議中各國代表儘管保證實行「消除貿易壁壘的國際方案」，但時實際上却發生上述的種種情形。　當美國把戰時工業改變為平時工業時，不過是單純的技術上的轉變，可是別的國家非但改變其工廠，並且改變了它們的整個政治和外交機構。</p>
<p>英國也展開了猛烈的經濟戰。受英國政府津貼的英國路透社，以遠較美國通訊社低廉的代價供給新聞於拉丁美洲報紙和無綫電台。路透社利用它的讀者和聽眾，不但替英國商品做廣告，並且巧妙地散播僞裝的反美宣傳，使美國喪失了許多友人。</p>
<p>美國態度</p>
<p>美國務院國際貿易政策司的態度是：擴大國際貿易範圍，應由私人企業經營，對各國應一視同仁而沒有歧視。這就美國本身講，是一個很好的態度，只怕別的國家意見不能相合。</p>
<p>他們說：「我們需要大量出口，因為我們的生產量太大，要使人民都不失業，只有把商品推銷到外國去。我們還可以產銷比他國更低廉的商品？這樣，在自由貿易的世界我們將排除他人而獨佔市場。於是他們自行成立協定，把我們擯在門外，以為抵制。但是我們可以自行決定，怎樣在美國的境界以內經營商業。要是我們不贊成別國的做法，那我們也無能為力，因為我們並沒有利用在拉丁美洲的政治權力，來達到經濟上的目的。」</p>
<p>他們的話是很對的，美國的熊度反映着美國的缺乏外交政策。我們希望達到每年出口二千萬美元的目標，使一千二百萬美國人不致失業，這個數字和一九三二年的失業人數正復相同。</p>
<p>但是，如果我們期望世人等待我們先自解決貿為問題，我們是要失望的。看了停在碼頭上準備運往國外的新汽車而感到得意洋洋的美國人，實在並沒有知道我們是在十九輛新車中只有一輛出口，而法國，舉例說，却在三輛汽車中有二輛出口。</p>
<p>美國國會四領袖：自左至右，參院少數黨（民主黨）領袖康納利，眾院議長馬丁（共和黨），參院議長（共和黨）范登堡及眾院少數黨，（民主黨）領袖雷本。（本報特的維的時報攝寄）</p>

<p>發售小型信箱</p>
<p>又郵局以滬上人口稠密，信差投遞住戶信件，因問訊等候，在時間上頗多浪費，郵局為改善投遞節省人力起見，特製就一種小型信箱，備公眾採用。此外並推行存局候領辦法，凡初到上海無一定住處者，可事前通知寄件人寫交上海〇〇郵局存局候領，屈時可自往郵局面取。</p>

<h3>蘇杭勝地探春集團旅行頻繁　旅行社團服務忙碌成羣結隊遊客擁擠</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕冬天的尾巴，在前天最後一次來自　西比利亞的反　氣旋中截住了　。隔牆的柳樹，平白地添了嫩枒，隨風舞動，招引着在市區裏生活的人們，走向空曠去處，接觸一决綠色淸新的大自然，讓彎曲的腰背舒要一下，呼吸一口鄉野間存在着的氣息。</p>
<p>綠色淸新的節季到了，是人們返回大自然，重溫一次童年殘夢的時候。</p>
<p>幾天來，兩路局的生意，又開始好起來，遊覽蘇杭的旅客，夾在走單帮的人中間，成羣結隊的被吞噬在黑色的車廂裏。等候着買票的人，像舊曆年關時一樣的擁擠，照相材料行的生意，突然旺盛。迎南京路屈臣氏藥房照相部，也被偷賊光顧了一决，一夜醒來，發現照相機被竊十九架，價值千萬元。</p>
<p>前週末，兩種局招待各報記者遊覽杭州，是今年集團「探春」的第一聲，上海的幾家著名旅行社和旅行團，也在忙着為遊客和它的團員們服務。中國旅行社的業務很廣，特設一個游覽組，專辦小組集團旅行的業務，該社的旅行雜誌，是銷行全世界的惟一中國旅行刋物，舉凡全國乃至全球各國的名勝幽跡，無不蒐羅詳畫。其次是一個業餘性質的友聲旅行團，已有了三十年的歷史，現有團員一萬三千餘人，戰前也有「友聲月刋」和各種特刋發行。其他尚有太平洋和經濟兩個旅行社，暨萍蹤，業餘兩個旅行團。它們在旅行之餘，對於推行社會敎育，都有輔助的勞績。</p>
<p>旅行「社」和旅行「團」的區別，就在後者有固定的團員，不接受非團負的委託，專辦理團員旅行的業務。為使讀者明瞭各家的旅行情形，記者對它們作了個普遍的訪問，它們差不多每週都有一定的遊程，這一週末盡是不的而同的到蘇杭去，每决名額都有限制，超過了限額，可以另行組織。費用方面，視遊程的遠近及當地的生活費用而定；例如到杭州去，來往三天，最貴的是萍蹤旅行團，需二十八萬元，友聲旅行團僅需十五萬元，中國旅行社是二十七萬元，經濟旅行社是二十五萬元，太平洋旅行社是二十四萬五千元，業餘旅行團是十七萬五千元，都供給來往定備火車。遊船·汽車及早午晚膳，旅館茶水等，由於費用的差別，可能是享受方面也分了等級。據友聲旅行社的負責人說，為團員服務，常常是賠本。</p>
<p>此外靑年館舉辦的杭州旅行，於下月四日出發，規定一百人的限額，早就登記一空，參加旅行者祇交六萬五千元，包括來往一切的費用。假如道决試辦的結果可以收支平衡的話，該館在以後的幾個週末，決將繼續舉辦，直到人們興盡的時候為止</p>
<p>作家杭州觀光團，也在下月初起程前往。四月一二兩日是各學校的春假，私人和團體的旅行組織，更是多得不可勝述。祇是兩路局由於車輛的限制，不能像戰前一樣的儘量供應，現在能够供應旅行社團一節專車，已經大感不易，折扣優待更談不到了！</p>

<h3>本屆師範教育運動週獻詞　教育事業的基本修養</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>一一激發教師的愛心</p>
<p>敎育事業是最崇高的精神事業，從事敎育事業的人，必須抱一顆純潔深厚的愛心，才能啟發兒童或靑年的智慧，陶鑄兒童或靑年的人格。眞能感化學生的內心，使敎育發生積極效果的敎師，一定會以最熱忱的愛，去滋潤學生的心靈的。</p>
<p>我國先哲曾說：「經師易得，人師難求」。的確，我們如果要找專門灌輸知識技能的敎師還比較容易，要求眞能給予學生人格薰沐情緒利導的敎師便很難了。因為前者大多是外鑠的、被動的；而後者則為內化的，自發的。前者至多使學生增進一點知能；而後則能使學生由內心的感悟，二和敎師發生情感上的交流，因此改變整個的行為。</p>
<p>照進步的敎育原理說，敎育的最大目的，在求被敎育者行為的改變。所謂行爲，應該包括學生所有的一切思想，習慣，情緒，態度等。傳統的敎育，授唯知主義的影響很深，以為敎育只要做到讀書聽講便够了，其實把敎育的主要目的反而丟開，「識字就是教育」「讀書就是教育」等錯誤的觀念支配在一般人的腦中，造成社會上大多數人對敎育的誤解。實在，敎育的價值必須通過被敎育者的心靈而達到行為的實賤，才能顯示出來。因此知識，情感和意志三者成為敎育過程中的三要素，而情感尤為獲得知識與鍛鍊意志所不可缺少。近代敎育家認為一切學習，首當激起動機和興趣。但要激發動機和興趣，便不得在被教育者的心中對於學習對象——教師，教材及一切教學動境，構成一種強烈的情感作用，使他們樂願去接受。從這種情形，就可以看出教師的態度對於學生學習的影響是何等之大。</p>
<p>可是一般的敎師都忽視了這一點，以致敎育有趨於「商業式」的傾向，學校成了販賣知識的場所，敎師的敎學，好像為的是把知識賣給學生，學生進學校，好像為的是向敎師購買知識，師生之間也無情感之可言，教師更不必過問到學生行為的改變。當然，這情形不能一概而論，我們有時也可以看到開明的敎師，他們以熟烈的愛心去溫暖兒童或靑年的心靈，而獲得人格感化的實效。不過能這樣做的似乎還不很多，否則敎育的效果不是要大大增進了嗎？</p>
<p>我國舊日的書院制度，在某種情形之下是很可眅的。因為它能够注重到師生情感的聯緊，它重的陶鑄。再看從前的私墊，從師生接觸機會比較多的一點來說，也不無可取。墊師的鐵面孔，有時固令學生望而生畏，但墊師和學生，墊師和學生家長的關係，欲求之於今日的學校幾乎不可復得。今昔敎育組織的不同是此中一大原因，敎師不得發軍敎育上的情感力量是另一大原因。</p>
<p>記得凱欣斯泰勒曾說過：「敎師精神的本實」是對兒童的純愛，凡不能愛兒童者，根本不能做敎育家」。這話也能應用於敎育靑年。靑年和克童都賦與生俱來的熟情，其坦白天眞視中年人老年人尤過之，我們與其用嚴威來敎管他，還不如以真誠來感動他。教育不是強制，而是誘導；不是注入，而是啓發，教師果能多用激勵鼓舞的方式指導學生從事一切學習，則效果一定很大。敎師既得學生的信任，便不愁他不接受敎師的指導，既接受敎師的指導，便不愁他不在思想，習慣，情緒，態度各方面受到敎師的啟示，而影響到他全人格的發展。</p>
<p>近年來，我國敎育當局極注重各級學校訓導方法的改進，如實施「導師制」，提倡師生共同生活，都屬切要之圖。我們希望敎師們都能拿出熱烈的愛心來，並非主張敎育應完全自由放任，木重紀律，相反的我們很希望從事敎育事業的人都能抱嚴正的態度為敎育而努力，不過我們所要求的愛決非溺愛，而是純愛，慈愛，情感而伴理智的愛。孔子的望之嚴而即之溫的敎育精神，今日的教師還是應該效法的。</p>
<h3>市長杯足球賽靑白得決賽權　複賽二比一倖勝蘇聯</h3>
<p>市長盃足球複賽，昨日下午三時，靑白與蘇聯，會師於遠　球場，靑白曹秋亭吳祺祥，均下場作戰，球迷紛至沓來，逸園場內，人頭擁擠，約有一萬四千餘人，情况熱烈。角逐結果，上半時書秋亭攻入一球佔先，下半時，蘇聯反攻，扳成平手，靑白陣內，險象頻生，幸最後三分鐘之努力，會秋亭踢任意球，羅壽福射入，以二比一倖勝蘇聯，獲得決賽權，將與東華作市長盃錦標決戰。昨雙方陣容錄下：</p>
<p>靑白</p>
<p>秦必高</p>
<p>嚴士鑫　吳祺祥上　薛沛然下</p>
<p>瞿永福　孟義良　高保正下　薛沛然上</p>
<p>曹秋亭　羅壽福　李義臣　高保正上　顧以撒　李松筠下　費春華下</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>柴哈洛夫</p>
<p>雪司谷下　卡洛列區上　谷托夫</p>
<p>沙樂寗　鐵伏尼　勃郎下　捷林谷夫</p>
<p>卡洛列區下　諾高洛夫上　E格里納司　勞勃司托夫　阿畢谷夫　卡普司丁</p>
<p>八分鐘內</p>
<p>秋亭先開記錄</p>
<p>三時正，裁判黃仁彝，巡邊陳吉祥何春暉，登場執法，雙方列陣，蘇聯隊獻花後，即行進攻，勞勃司托夫、阿畢谷夫連轡並進，見阻於義良，靑白反攻，羅壽福李司開屢獲射門機會，均未奏功，八分鐘時，顧以撒底角勾中，曹秋亭趕到，加上一脚，球入網內，一比零靑白紀錄先開</p>
<p>上半時終</p>
<p>靑白一球佔先</p>
<p>蘇聯痛失首城，大舉來犯，諾高洛夫左角吊中，小黃毛越位在先，混戰至二十四分鐘時，吳祺祥脚傷離場，高保正退守右前衛，小顧內移，李松筠接補右翼，蘇聯趁靑白陣容空虛，橫施襲擊，幸嚴士鑫與孟義良應付得宜，保住江山，未幾上半時告終，育白遂以一比〇佔先。</p>
<p>冷箭中的</p>
<p>蘇聯拔成和局</p>
<p>檸檬過後，兩軍再鬥，靑日五鋒前進，無奈秋亭失去聯絡，用武無地，義臣懶性激發，松一均動作遲鈍，中衛綫協助後防，前綫鞭長莫及，全陣遂成兩截，蘇聯則志在復仇，攻勢甚強，卡晋司丁，單騎探營，幸必高機警，未為所乘，未幾小黃毛又於舟碼外試探，球勢峻急，撲成角球，諾高洛夫開來，恰到好處，沙樂寗於人叢中，暗發冷箭中的，一比一蘇聯扳成和局。</p>

<p>上半時交大一分佔先</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕滬交大籃球隊蒞京後，初戰以二十二比十八擊敗六朝松後，昨遇美軍竟以二十三比二十六三分之差受挫，但昨日美軍表演失常，而交大倪志琦頭部撞傷，否則美軍仍將敗北也。戰程經過如次：三時正，嗚金啟戰，交大倪志琦指揮三軍，首取攻勢，首開紀錄，沈被軍身手靈活，前後接應，胡京文二投二中，第一節以六比二控制美軍。旋美軍克拉與賴遜蓄志復仇，二投一罰追成八比八平等，交大再還以顏色，成十四比十三領先於上半時。檸檬後，美軍陣勢略有更動，節節勝利，交大隊長倪志琦復因頭部撞傷，致成失敗之局。綜觀昨賽，交大茍能鎮靜應付，勝利可操左券。</p>

<h3>募銷美金債券規則草案　昨晨由俞財長核定　國行訂各地募銷委會組織規則經報請財政部備案並分飭施行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年美金庫券公債募銷收款發票規則，及基金監理委員會組織規程各項草案，業已於昨晨送呈財政部俞部長核定，即日公布施行。記者爲此特趨訪財部公債司司長陳炳章，探詢詳情。陳氏當稱：庫券公債各項草案，係於昨晨由財部帮辦蓋博銘，呈奉俞</p>
<p>核定。至各地募銷委員會組織規則，昨（廿九日）經中央銀行訂定，報請財政部備案</p>
<p>經分飭施行。此項規則，業經財部核定。速同繳購美金公債折合單之部令，於本日（卅日）同時發表。</p>
<p>鞏固債信組織健全</p>
<p>基金監理委員會組織規程，其要點亦經陳氏摘述如次：渠稱財部爲鞏固債信計，對於該會之組織，已力求健全。例如規程丙明文規定，基委會「於監理範圍內，得獨立行使其職權。在本庫券公債本息全部淸償前、其監理權限，不得變更。」「對於鞏固政府債信，維護持票人權益事項，得隨時向財政部建議之。」又對於庫券基金担保之國營事業及敵偽產業，「得延聘專家，爲獨立之調查，並得監理此項事業及產業之出售，及出售前之經營。」又「財政部中央銀行暨其他有關主管機關，應將本庫券公債之基金，依照條例所規定，按時預先撥交基金監理委員會保管監理。」又每次還本針劑息到期前，基委會應於基金內「按照應付數額，撥交經理銀行備付，並登報公告之。」以及基委會由各有關機關代表，暨各人民金融工商各社團之領袖，共同組織。各項規定，其用意均在加强該會之組織及職權，並求其辦事之公開，足徵政府維持債信之決心。</p>
<p>手續簡化不收費用</p>
<p>至將來各地募銷收款事項，是否專由國行辦理一點，陳氏稱：以國行受託辦理募銷事宜，得在國內外各地，聘請當地人士，組織募銷委員會辦理之，並得指定當地若干銀行錢莊，代收債款。其募銷收款發票手續，力求簡化。承購人繳購價款，決不收任何手續費。至代收債款行莊，對於所收債款，應專戶存儲，不計利息。除逐日報告當日收入金額外，並應每十天結算一次，解繳各當地國行，即日轉解總行，列收庫帳，再由總行彙報財政部備查。</p>
<p>募銷委會辦理事項</p>
<p>各地募銷委員會，將辦理下列事項：（一）募銷之推進及宣傳。（二）募銷團體行莊之約定。（三）募銷手續之簡化及流弊之防止。（四）募銷數額及超募之分配。（五）對於鞏固本庫券公債債信事項之建議。至該會委員，定爲十一人至十七人。除以當地國行代表爲當然委員外，餘就商會銀行錢業公會代表，暨其他各界領袖聘任之。</p>
<p>最後記者以政府力求國立債信，自爲人民所歡迎，但對於戰前公債，是否準備整理，以此叩詢陳氏，據答：該一問題，並非本人此次來滬之任務，恕不多　。總之，此次政府發行庫券公債各種辦法，足證當局已下定決心，與民更始，以最大努力，儘量設計恢復債信。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕財政部公債司司長陳炳章，已於昨晚乘晚車返京。</p>
<p>金融領袖發表意見</p>
<p>對政府發行債券意見，（一）錢業耆宿秦潤卿氏，略謂：政府毅然發行美金債券，保持幣值，誘導市塲游資，深合人民心理，可謂賢明之舉。余所期望於政府者，一則是項收入，須用以穩定金融，以蘇民困。一則保管基金，須廣延公團參加，以堅民言云云。（二）市商會常務理事駱濟華氏稱政府於實施經濟改革方案之初，首先公佈發行美金券債條例，可謂切合時代需要，債券均以美金爲準，無處幣值下跌．物價金融，當更獲穩定，經濟趨勢，將自此轉捩點，漸呈樂觀云云。</p>

<h3>國產香烟提高品質　美烟銷路大减　進口外烟大部係走私貨</h3>
<p>茲據烟業中人談稱：自勝利以後，外國捲烟即隨蒲駐華英美海陸軍首先輸入，散佈街頭各烟攤販，在價康物美原則下，嗜烟者莫不購吸，普遍風行，致國產捲烟光芒頓被斂抑，銷路因之受挫，查當時市上最盛銷之外國香烟，係美製「駱駝牌·吉士牌·馬力斯牌·及樂更牌」等數種，英烟因價昂關係次之，後因外匯提高，外來捲烟價格上漲甚鉅，再加以頤中烟公司出品「三砲台·前門·大南未」等香烟，及國產香姻提高品質，與之競爭下，外烟銷路終於受阻，迄至本年政府實施輸入管制後，捲烟輸入即受嚴格限制，目前市上出售之包裝及聽裝外國捲烟，大部爲香港走私轍入由華南方面偷運來滬，惟美烟銷路已不及過去之旺盛云。</p>
<h3>國行所購黃金將暫存國庫</h3>
<p>中央銀行前爲採取黃金拋售政策後，曾向美國購買大量黃金，以供市塲需要。美輸一艘於本月上旬自舊金山駛滬，裝黃金二萬六千斤（計十三噸）之鉅，已誌昨日本報。此頃大量黃金傳係前行政院長宋子文向美所訂購，以供中央銀行作爲拋售之用，但迄今始運抵本埠，而拋售政策已廢止，承運之公司現正向中央銀行商討提貨手續，但此批黃金已失運用之需要，故將暫存國庫云。</p>
<h3>减低麵粉議價市長擬請示中樞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉；吳市長認爲目前本市麵粉之價，似嫌過高。緣麵粉與米價之比例，過去平均，向爲麵粉三包半，合米一擔。惟按目前麵粉及食米價格，樓需麵粉二包餘，即可合米一擔。故曾召集各粉廠負責人洽談减低價議辦法。各廠商表示，因有種積困難存在，爲原料供應不暢等問題，故請暫勿减低議價。聞吳市長正擬將减低麵粉議價之事，請示中樞當局，以便決定减低與否。</p>

<h3>國行貼放委會　今日正式成立</h3>
<p>設工業出口貸款審核會</p>
<p>中央銀行總裁張嘉　氏，因感一於國有銀行業務上之需要，決定組織貼放委員會，定於今日正式成立，據悉：該會之主要任務，一爲與商業行莊取得聯繫，協助生產，及出口事業，下設業貸款與出口物資貸款兩審核委員會，辦理商業行莊申請重貼現韓質押轉押匯等審核事宜云。</p>
<h3>蛋類輸英即將恢復</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日專電〕據美農業部稱：中國即將恢復蛋類出口貿易，聞依據協定草稿，中央信託局將在財力上資助主要對英出口蛋類之收購包裝及冷藏。農業部報告中並指出，以前蛋類出口額年的值美金一千二百萬元，並謂是項計劃，有待中國政府之批准，因其牽涉外匯率，及中央信託局之盈虧也。同時亦有待與英糧食部商同辦理，農業部報告中，並謂在正常情形之下，全世界之油菜子產額，大部出於中國，且輸出量極大。一九四六年至一九四七年之中國油菜子產量，估計約爲四百萬噸。</p>
<h3>毛紡織業請求　寬放原料限額量　今由程理事長面呈輸管會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕毛紡織業因羊毛類原料限額太少，各廠相繼停工或减工，問題至爲嚴重。該公會秘書楊立人，連日趕製各項統計表格十餘種，定於引為鑒戒由程理事長面呈輸管會限配處李處長，請求放寬限度，以免停頓。茲將全國毛紡織廠開工及職工統計表，附錄於左：</p>
<p>全國毛紡織廠設備開工及職工統計表</p>
<h3>原料供應無把握　民營廠暫停供油　食油議價又有調整說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市食油配售，國營油廠方面，每日仍由中國植物油廠供應七百担，並未間斷，上海食油聯配處所承配之民營油廠食油，其第四循環之配油一千六百担，自於二十四日完畢後，即未繼續配售。</p>
<p>據業中人談：民營油廠雖尚不無相當存底，惟以原料供應無把握，故只得暫停供油。據悉：國民營油廠所需原料，前曾一度與中央信託局接洽，由該局先供給大豆四千噸，以每担六萬元之價格，分配中植油廠三千噸，民營油廠一千噸。一說該項辦法且已經前行政院長宋子文批准。刻聞油廠方面，正推派代表，與吳市長洽談此事，擬請將該項大豆，速行撥出，俾便繼續榨油，以維民食。又聞食油價格審議委員會，將於日內召開會議，食油議價，或又將調整云。</p>
<p>油市騰漲原因</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕油市連日騰漲，業中人分折原因，認爲：（一）係來地價貴，（二）係本市食油大批出口。據稱：昨日靑島來電，該地生油每担廿六萬元，運滬費用每担三萬五千元，故每担抵滬一之净價，已達廿九萬五千元。如一爲吉普桶生油，則每担尚須加桶費二萬元。又查三月份本市曾有生油五六千担運港，藉以掉取不能結匯之國外轍入品。問政府對此事，頗爲關注，刻正密切調查中。再近數日內，本市寳隆等洋行，曾裝淸油花生油等的一千噸出口，運銷國外云。</p>

<h3>台北事件雨過天青　野心家混水摸魚　始末記</h3>
<p>— 湃崖</p>
<p>臺灣自卅四年十月廿五日歸返與國以後，在初期是忙於接收及整理，所以陳長官亦定卅五年爲接收年，當日本移交給我們的時候，所有的工廠，礦塲，及各生產部門都陷於停頓狀態，簡直找不到有繼續在冒烟的工廠，是以在去年雖云接收，但是一面仍恢復原有工作，工廠也逐漸地冒了烟，生產的塲所，也擁有成千成萬工人在作着工，不論那一部門都有長足的進步，陳長官爲穩定臺省之金融安定社會秩序，俾免受國內外之經濟危機所影響，除請中央准臺省仍用臺幣外，並推行專　政策以防外資的侵蝕，影嚮物價的波動，這是爲着臺灣的建設，人民的生活，亦得以補助省庫的收人。</p>
<p>談到專賣政策，主要的機構便是專賣局，牠主要的專賣品也就是烟，酒，火柴，樟腦等，牠每月補助雀庫的收入的全數之百分之五十張，車賣局爲求業務之發展，常然是專賣的推銷，因近來發現外來烟充斥，滿街滿巷的小烟販，排滿私烟，我們中國人素來都是喜歡吸洋烟，臺灣亦不能例外，於此一來，專賣局的業務受影響得非常嚴重，於二月下旬據報有帆船一艘滿載洋烟在淡水登陸，欲侵入本市，乃派查緝員前往查緝，結果船是有的，而洋烟已起卸完畢，各查緝員乃分頭查緝各私烟攤，以期杜絕。</p>
<p>禍端的開始</p>
<p>二月二十七日的晚上的略是七時的光景查緝員盛鐵夫，鍾延洲，趙子健，劉超羣，傳學通，葉得根，六名，便乘卡車一輛前往臺北市最熱鬧之延平路（即太平町）一帶查緝，一般眼快的小販奔逃躲避，中有一女烟販林江邁因逃避不及被獲，查緝員依法當然是沒收，而女烟販以血本所關，抗拒查緝員沒收，致雙方發生爭執，時民衆圍睹者甚衆，裏面即有一班終日尋求是非之流氓，乘機附和吵鬧，並用石塊投擲查緝員，至而轟轟之聲不絕於耳，打聲一响，拳足千枝，蜂踴而前，少數的查緝人員難以抵抗，乃棄車分頭逃逸，但是這一般暴徒竟仍不顧，集隊尾追，非得之不甘心之慨，中有一查緝員被追逼迫，爲自衛起見乃發槍一响，不意即命中人羣中之一人，名爲陳文溪。彈穿左胸，當塲斃命，女烟販林江邁亦爲擊傷，於是暴徒擁着一般民衆逕到憲兵隊及臺北市警察局要求將兇手交出，由民衆處決，以償被擊斃之人命，一面打鑼吶喊助威，憲警雖力加解釋，均不得緩和局勢，暴徒一面又將奪獲查緝員所乘之卡車推到西門圓圈焚毀，如此竟胡鬧絡夜。</p>
<p>打風的襲來</p>
<p>至翌日（廿八）上午九時，民衆又沿街打鑼打鼓强令商家罷市，全市商店，相率關門，到處騷動，羣情惶惶，時有一部份民衆敲鑼打鼓至太平町時，某派出所黃警長欲上前阻止，不但無半點收效，且被圍住毒打，該派出所亦爲暴徒搗毀，傷害政府人負及搗毀政府機關之行爲後此開端，旋又有民衆萬餘包園專賣局及臺北分局，各處民衆如山崩海倒般洶湧而至，衝至局裏，遇見外省籍人員劈頭便打，並將局裏之火柴，香烟，酒，汽車，脚踏車，及其他公物，財產一概搬出馬路焚毀，雖門窗戶扇亦皆罹難，無一完整，一時火光冲天，至三月一日餘火尙朱全熄，圍觀之民衆仍有二三千人之多，憲警雖趕到，亦無法維持。</p>
<p>冤魂滿天飛</p>
<p>當廿八日下午開始焚毀專賣局時，全市各街巷到處皆有暴徒集團尋找來自國內之外省人施以毆打，名之曰「阿山」是以「阿山」若爲彼董所瞥見，皆不能逃過「打」的刦數，重則斃命，輕亦在殘廢之列，雖婦孺孕婦，亦無一幸免，據記者所知：一數歲之兒童隨其母出街，途遇暴徒，用刀將其母之嘴割裂至耳，復將衣服剝光痛毆垂斃拋之於水溝，共子被用力扭轉面部倒置背後，即時氣絕斃命，又一小孩被其雙足搓起倒吊將頭部猛向地上碰擊，至頭破髓流而甘心，又一將兩小孩之頭互爲相碰，至腦血橫流，而引爲快事，又一孕婦亦被暴徒用日本之武士刀對準腹部插入即時兩命嗚呼，此種狼毒手段，不勝枚舉，慘絕人寰之事，不意竟發生在此號爲文化水準高於國內任何一省之臺灣，聞者毛骨悚然，何况目睹某狀者，是時外省人無不人人自危，逃者逃，避者避，幾有「風聲鶴唳，草木皆流氓」之概，沿街喊打「阿山」之聲，响徹雲霄而不絕於耳，各機關亦皆閉門大吉，人員也咸以走爲上策。在此時期可謂流氓世界，廿八日下午二時許，又有一部份羣衆的一二千人趨向長官公署，企圖暴動，爲衛士阻止，並鳴槍驅散，雙方略有死傷，然暴徒並不因此而散歸回家情勢反而複雜，復趨往北門圍攻鐵路警察署，該署職員被毆重傷者多人，並被刦去槍械多桿，幸憲兵趕到始得解圍（因軍警遵奉陳長官之命令不得擅予開槍）繼而學生停課，各機關團體員工怠工，商店不開，居家閉戶，一切皆陷入極混亂狀態，綜計本日暴動之處幾遍全臺北市，公私汽車，卡車，被毀十餘輛，外省人及公務人員被毆或傷或斃爲數甚多，虎標永安堂與臺北唯一之大百貨商店新臺公司皆被搗毀或乘機搶掠一空，（據民政處初步之調查統計僅臺北一隅公敎人員死傷四百餘財產達臺幣五億元數目相當驚人，）其他各縣市尙未列入，最不幸者新竹縣長朱文伯因公乘自備轎車來臺北，至太平町便遭暴徒重毆，幸得逃脫，此時由南部北上之火車中乘客有外省人者，下車時亦皆爲預伏在車站之流氓毆打，死與傷亦爲數至鉅，長官公署曁警備司令部爲安定秩序起見，晚間起即宣佈戒嚴，但夜來流氓仍帶槍帶刀集團行動，槍聲頻聞，未能入寐，宛若置身戰塲。</p>
<p>政府的處置</p>
<p>這事件從廿七日晚醞釀至八日晚不獨不見得减低聲勢，反而益加擴大，是以長官公署曁警備總司令部除寰佈戒嚴外並發表對此次案件之處置，其要點如下：（一）對於緝私肇禍之人員決予法辦，並嚴令以後不得再有類此事件發生。（二）少數暴徒因此事而發生越軌行動致危及治安，總司令部已實行臨時戒嚴藉以保護秩序，一俟平復，戒嚴令即可撤銷。</p>
<p>人民的要求</p>
<p>至三月一日晨起仍是一片打聲，繼續搗毀公營事業機關，公務人員宿舍，無孔不尋，極盡「打」「毀」之能事，至十時臺北布參議會邀請國大代表，省參議員，參政員，等組織緝烟血案處理委員會，在中山堂召開成立大會，由議長周延壽主持略謂：本會應畫量接受市民之要求，將之傳達政府，以求本案之圓滿解決，並經出席人魚熱烈發表意見，結果決議派代表省參議長黃朝琴，臺北市參議長周延壽，省參議員王添燈，參政員兼廣播電臺長林忠四人前往長官公署　見陳長官，並提五個條件：（一）立即解除戒嚴令，（二）被捕之市民即開釋，（三）下令不准軍警憲開槍，（四）官民共同組織處理委員會，（五）請陳長官對民衆廣播，當時陳長官即面允，第一條於四時以前召集各機關處理解除戒嚴令，第二條由各被捕市民之父兄里隣長聯名保證釋放，第三，四，五，允予照辦，而廿七晚被緝私人員擊斃及受傷之市民驚備總司令部即函臺北市參議會以當局決定撥付臺幣二十萬元爲撫卹，傷者五萬元請代轉知具領。（待續）</p>

<p>中共慘淡經營了十二年，視爲「神經中樞」的廷安，經國軍五個師一個禮拜的自衛反擊，就不得不被迫放棄，倉皇北遁，這不僅是充分表現了國軍無堅不摧，無攻不克的堅強戰力，同時正也證實了共軍的戰力薄弱，不堪一擊。中共三四月來嘗一再强調　染要「保衛大延安」，初未料「大延安」竟會於一個星期內悄然棄守，對於這一點，中共是再也無法如過去引用棄守張家口，四平街，長春，和臨沂的同一遁詞，以掩飾他　在軍事上的敗績的。戰機動作戰，消砂國軍，保存實力，而不在一點一綫之得失。」那末，延安棄守後的中共往何處去？</p>
<p>攻擊目標</p>
<p>據若干有名軍事家的觀察和分析，其所得的幾乎一致的結論是：今後共軍可能的攻擊目標爲：（一）太原，（二）長春，（三）濟南，（四）靑島，（五）保定。當然，如兵力允許，有機可乘，共軍是可能對上述五地或數地同時發動攻勢，但其中要以攻略太原的公算爲最大。</p>
<p>太原地位</p>
<p>據陳總長最近報吿，共軍總部可能退往晋西北，那末，今天在陝北的共軍除以最少數兵力牽制並遲滯由延安北上國軍前進外，其主力似甚可能以最迅速姿態調集晋中，甚至與業已渡河北竄的劉伯誠的宋仁窮（冀魯豫軍區司令員）陳賡（太行軍區司令員）王新亭（太岳軍區司令員）及聶榮臻（晋冀察軍區司令員）姚喆（綏蒙軍區司令員）等部圍攻孤山西中部的太原的。山西物產豐饒，初不如陝北之貧脊，太原在兵要地理和政治地理上的地位，又遠較侷處一隅的延安高出多多，太原如攻下，不僅可挽回其棄守延安的顏面，並可進而控制三晋，東出娘子關，攻保定，窺平津，北上大同張家口，恢復其通外蒙及蘇聯的走廊，同時並分出若干小股竄擾國軍後方之豫鄂川陝察綏，牽制國軍兵力，破壞後方交通，擾亂後方秩序，然後再以主力準備在晋冀邊區選擇他所認爲適當的時地（正如朱德所謂共軍兵力以擴張至與國軍平衡時）與國軍遂行決戰，這是當前共軍最得意的一着，同時也是他主觀上所念念不忘的如意算盤。</p>
<p>不碰硬釘</p>
<p>長春爲東北的心臟，其地位遠較哈爾濱佳太斯爲重要，共軍曾兩度發動春季攻勢，遭受挫敗，但因該區共軍在地理條件上獲得接濟補充比國內任何地區爲旣便且利，故捲土三犯，亦有可能。　保定是河北省會所在地，共軍進攻亦有可能，濟南靑島目下皆爲孤縣的國軍大據點，陳毅現將主力集中於膠濟沿綫，其企圖不問可知，而濟南直到記者寫本文時，其再度攻勢迄未休止。靑島駐有美國海軍，爲國際觀瞻所在之地，雖無必攻或必佔決心，至少茍將靑島水源地佔領，亦將予該地居民以不少困擾。其他如大同（共軍於園攻太原時，可能以一部攻擊大同，以阻止傅作義部馳援。）張家口，歸綏，部亦有被攻擊可能。至平津目下國軍宣力堅强，共軍向來是不碰硬釘子，故其被擊可能性，當爲最小。以上是就共軍爲主的看法。</p>
<p>軍事重點</p>
<p>在國軍堅强反擊下，共軍此項企圖，正是給予國軍殲滅其主力的最好時機。如以國軍爲主，則誠如陳參謀總長所云：「今後軍事重點，當在山東」。國軍北上部隊，正由湯恩伯，歐震，王敬久三個兵團分自臨沂，兗州，鉅野，齊頭並進，左翼方面，因係魯西南平原，進軍較速，前鋒已越寗陽汶上，渡大汶河北進至泰安外圍，鐵路正面則已抵大汶口附近，右翼方面亦自臨沂逐漸北進，一方並與曲阜東進國軍閣剿盤據泗水及泗水東南鳳凰山萬餘共軍及費縣西南梁邱之兩個師（新七師，（新十師），該地區肅淸後，右翼及正面國軍側背威脅淸除，即可從容北進。待左翼王敬久兵團與濟南王耀武都正式會師，將津浦綫徐濟段打通後，進而打通膠濟綫，（最低限度，濟南至張店淄博綫，應隨着先打通。）再與湯歐諸兵團，將沂蒙山區包圍圈逐漸縮小而殲滅之。</p>
<p>流竄生涯</p>
<p>依據目下情勢判斷：魯共將其眷屬及笨重輜重運送黃河以北（兵力未調），似有予阻擊圍剿國軍失利後以一部退竄膠東作因獸關，（本月十九日濟南北濼口黃河水位即漲至一點零二公尺，水深三點九公尺，流速每秒一點一四公尺，水面寬七二點零八公尺，波濤汹湧，水量並在繼續增漲中，故如膠濟綫再被國軍打通後，其沂蒙山區共軍如欲於冬季前渡河北竄，自非易易。相同的，現在黃河北岸濟南外圍的齊河，晏城，桑梓店等據點，國軍因救援艱難，短期內亦可能吃共軍的虧。）以一部化裝老百姓，潛伏民間，成爲地下部隊，襲擊國軍，而其大部恐即利用其輕裝快速的裝備，化整爲零，隨時突圍，重度其所謂二萬五千里長征的流竄生涯，外表上掛着馬古斯共產主義的金字招牌，骨子裏則正如李自成張獻忠之流的竄到那裏，殺到那裏，住到那裏，也吃到那裏。</p>

<h3>美國最近文壇　中篇小說盛行</h3>
<p>— 黎東方</p>
<p>去年九月上旬，在邁格斯將軍號的甲板上，老同學吳組緗先生和我談了一小時左右，關於中篇小說的話。他是國內有數的中篇專家，這一次談話，是我於事前和他約好的，專談中篇問題，不談別的，也不讓任何一個第三者知道或參加。——神秘得很。</p>
<p>由於我缺乏基礎，我是百分之百的門外漢，所以他雖則竭力使我意會，而我却甚以未獲充分言傳爲憾。中篇究竟是什麼呢？該怎樣寫，或怎樣欣賞？</p>
<p>到了美國以後，很多短篇小說呌我滿意，也有很多呌我不滿意。長篇比較地容易令人滿意，也有很多令我廢卷而歎，老實說，內容不好。——我似乎要結論到中篇小說之無一不好了。。</p>
<p>如此說法，自然未免過份。然而中篇好的多，壞的少，却是事實。短篇與長篇呢，好的少，壞的多。</p>
<p>大槪是由於份量之恰到好處，編輯先生容易鑑賞選擇，所以選出來登載的，不容易壞到那裏去罷。讀者於無形中支持好的作家，也是由於同一原因。</p>
<p>現代的生活太忙了，不容許花上七八小時或兩個七八小時讀完一部長篇（300頁左右）。現代的生活也太不單純了，使得天衣無縫的簡單Theme，令人感覺幼稚，膚淺。</p>
<p>這又是中篇盛行的一個原因</p>
<p>中篇在篇幅上當然是介乎長短兩者之間。倘有人以爲中篇重在內容性質上的差異，而可以短過短篇五千字的標準，長過長篇三百頁（七萬五千字）的標準，當然也有他的言論自由。不過是否有意立異好高，或貽誤靑年，我就不敢斷定了。　中篇在性質上，也是介乎兩者之間，而兼有其長，牠着重某一點，正如短篇；但娓娓而談，不慌不忙則頗似長篇。牠能够吸引讀者之注意力，一直到底；但又不太單純幼稚，因爲除了一個重點以外，還可以寫幾個次要情節，旣可烘托，又更逼眞。</p>
<p>因此之故，牠今天盛行於美。</p>
<p>比較重要的幾個雜誌，每期都有一篇。這些雜誌，當然同時都有幾篇短篇小說。但是我敢說，短篇可好可壞，而中篇不敢不好：編輯先生不敢不選一篇好的。像那個月銷二百餘萬份的Red　Book（不是談紅色政治的），便是如此。其姊妹刊物Blue　Book（專供男子閱讀：Red　Book則男女均喜閱讀），也是如此。至於中國各大都市均可買到的星期六晚郵（Saturday　Evening's　Post）更是如此。很多人爲了閱續其中篇小說，而每星期必買。Collier,American,Cosmopolitan,Lady's　Home　Companion,Fortune等等，無不如此。</p>
<p>美國的一位中篇名作家Hele,Hull女士，正如組　先生一樣，不大肯給中篇以斬釘截鐵的定就。她說，「我所寫的Snow　in　Summer」（夏日之雪），小想寫成一個短篇，寫一個男子　然成名，不知如何是好。新的　望如何與舊的把環境不能適合，就是我要寫的文章。後來，我想，不如把主人翁寫成女子，而她最好是寫書成名，而不是如那位我所想寫的男子之獲得頭獎成名。最好這位女子同時是一位主婦，有很多孩子，又有一位頗有事業心與自尊心的男子：例如牙科醫生。當她忽然接得書店通知，她的書當選爲一個出版獎金的受益人之時，她的丈夫該如何反應。我又想把她寫爲住在小城市的主婦，於是鄰舍街坊該如何議論此事如何對她嫉妬。那麼，她不得不走，離開小城，甚至離開那位很不開心的丈夫（因爲他的一年收入，還比不上這個獎金）。並且在她走後，另有一位小姐，同情這位無辜的牙科醫生。——這就成爲一篇中篇小說了。</p>
<p>但是Helen　Hull心慈，所以這篇小說寫成的時候，女主人翁沒有和丈夫破裂。丈夫因欽佩之至而投降了。因此也就無庸加寫一位乘虛而入的同情者。</p>
<p>我把Helen　Hull的看法，歸併在知難行易的標題之下。行的人，常常是「行其心之所安」，知其然而不知其所以然。（此語並無包括我的老友之意）。</p>
<p>我特別愛讀Peter　Paul　OMara的「讓昨天去他的罷」！（Let　Yesterday　gol）昨天，是Anne　Darford與父親同住的灰色回憶，又是其後與某位科學家往過的黃色回憶。多情的Lenott醫生，兩同帮助她讓昨天成爲昨天</p>
<p>父親Huntley與她同住，不用僕人，不讓她讀書，因爲太窮。父親不與任何人往還，十分刻苦儉省。他們父女二人窮到只能略吃素菜，Anne甚至躱在廚房用冷水送下麵包，速素菜都不敢吃，省下來留給多病而脾氣壞的父親。</p>
<p>在父親旣死以後，參加葬禮的僅有寥寥可數的幾個人，包括Lenott醫生與Spale律師。當律師於當天晚間來拜訪的時候，Anne小姐知道他要來談父親的債務與呌她搬家讓出房子等等的問題了。誰知Spale律師，却吿訴她父親十分有錢，若干座房屋以外，還有二十萬美金現款，遺囑全部給她。——這呌Anne痛恨已死的父親。</p>
<p>Lenott醫生勸她到紐約去讀書做工，追求一個光明的明天。她到了紐約以後，經過幾個月的苦悶，果然習慣了而很快樂。Lenott醫生不該於特地乘火車來訪之時，開口替一位科學家募捐二萬元。她十分不快。但是過後也就把款子撥了。Lenott仍舊回原來的小城行醫。</p>
<p>科學家自己來到紐約，除了答謝以外，還希望再要一點。她不曾答應再給金錢，却於一再糾繼之餘，容許他接吻。他是何等地粗魯，簡單而自私的人物，爲什麼她能如此順從呢？她爲什麼把Lenott醫生拋棄乾淨呢？</p>
<p>寫小說的OMara先生一點也不怪她。Lenott醫生也不怪她。她曾經虛度了童年，與一半的靑春，今年已經有二十七歲了!我們只能略抱不平而已。</p>
<p>幸虧科學家粗魯過份，好喝酒，又同飯館的茶房打架，這才一呌她突然下了決心，把他摔掉，與恰好趕到紐約Lenott醫生十分地要好起來。第二個昨天，又去牠的了。</p>
<p>中篇小說約有趣，便在於如此地味兒忽濃忽淡。</p>

<h3>愛</h3>
<p>— 莊村</p>
<p>——有着愛在的以草作餐·比帶着恨的豢養的肥牛還要強　梭羅門</p>
<p>從古老而樸實地，或荒凉而寂寞的山村，從濃霧或烟火迷濛的城市，從遼遠或附近的不同的地帶：你們寄來這些有着一樣熟情的信箋，使我感到愉快的燙灼，使我有着燙灼後的痛苦。</p>
<p>我用顫抖的手，撕破你們的信筒，我抹着淚水，讓你們黑色，藍色，紅色，……一個一個像朗星一樣的字，跳進我底眼簾，在昏黃的燈火下，我止住了呼吸，擰蓿你們情感的結晶，我讀着，笑着；我讀着，哭着。……</p>
<p>你們的愛呵！像溫熱的聖水，流過我凍結在十二月的心扉，而我情感的火爐裏，一有了你們的愛，就如同有了熾熱的柴炭一樣；它就燒射出燦爛的火花，尖焰照亮了我平凡的生活。</p>
<p>——我曾爲你們誠摯的良心的愛，感動得失眠過好幾次呵！</p>
<p>有人說，他是爲友情而活着的，而我也是有了你們善良的愛，才有涉步在荆棘叢中的決心與毅力呵，在苦難蔓生如野草的路上，我沒有停止過步子，或回過頭去，婉惜那走過的路上，殘留着的自己的血痕，我也從沒有爲這艱辛而漫長的旅程，感到過苦惱和疲憊。</p>
<p>正如沒有太陽的日子，使我有了咒詛一樣；沒有愛的生活，我一天也過不了。我來到道世界上，原是爲了愛與被愛，如果，我生活的四周，都是一些情感麻木了的人，一些冰鐵一樣的生物，對他們我不能愛，也不能被愛，那我就會像沒有水的魚一樣；窒息的死去，窒息的死去呵！</p>
<p>我不曉得，愛是不是可以自私？我有似爲金錢而貪汚的人一樣；對於人們的愛，我是貪婪的吸取，我情願如一隻破船，在愛情泛濫的大海裏，讓洶湧的波濤打碎而沉沒；我情願像一隻撲燈蛾，在愛的火花上碰死，或在愛的沸油裏燙死。</p>
<p>那些懂得怎樣去愛，也懂得怎樣被愛的人，也就懂得怎樣去生活了。那些愛眾人，也被眾人所</p>
<p>愛的人，是異常幸福的了，他們過着有陽光有花菓的日子，他們沒有一些不必要的憂鬱和苦惱，再高的苦難，他們都能跨過，再大的打擊，他們都有抵抗的勇氣，愈是災難來臨，他們愈是高歌，他們恨得愈深，也愛得愈深。……他們的生活，是怎樣地在誘惑着我呵！</p>
<p>而我這個之濫着情感的人，是一樣的熱度與完整，我不希望你們中間，有任何一個人對我有了無理的擯棄，那比一個母親擯棄自亡的孩子，比一個男人擯棄自己的妻子還殘酷，那比勅使我陷入極度的飢餓，還更會找不能忍受。</p>
<p>一個生活在愛與僧中的孩子，她這一樣說：「假如別人不愛我，我寗願死不願活，……從我眞正愛的人得到誠心的愛，就是讓牛把我拌下來，將臂折了；或是站在踢人的馬後，讓牠的踢子踢我的胸口，我也願忍受。……」這孩子是怎樣地在重視別人的愛呵！她的話，是求愛的呼喊，也是我底呼喊呵！</p>
<p>今天，我要哭泣地叮囑你們，我是爲了你們的愛而生活着的，萬一你們吝嗇自己的情感，萬一你們……那你們就是有意舉手殺害自己的弟兄，那你們就有不可赦免的良心的罪咎。</p>
<p>我底手，申在這里：愛我的，被我愛的，你們來！我要你們緊緊地握着呵！握得緊緊地。</p>

<h3>潔茜的信</h3>
<p>— 灃莉</p>
<p>我認識偉，也認識潔茜，我也知道並且了解偉和潔茜的愛，他們對我都很坦白，從來沒有隱秘或諱飾。</p>
<p>潔茜還是FT大學四年級的女生，當潔茜是一年級新生時，偉是四年級學生；偉離開學校以後，潔茜便常寫信給他。</p>
<p>偉在潔茜的男朋友中是年齡最大的，潔茜從沒有愛過一個比她小的男孩子，她恨那些女子與年齡小的男子戀愛，她覺得那種愛是殘忍的，是該咀咒的。凡是讀過茶花女的人都會同情瑪格麗，可是潔茜是例外，她不願意同情她。不幸，這次他們學校演茶花而潔茜被派定飾瑪格麗，當潔茜發現飾阿芒的是一個一年級學生盧波，她感覺非常失望。但是結果，她愛了盧波，而漸漸竟忘記了偉</p>
<p>這裏是偉在最近給我看的潔茜的許多信中，我最喜歡的幾封信。其中有一封是給盧波的，一封是給導演陸老師的。照偉的推測，大概潔茜排戲太忙了，匆忙之中，把寫給別人的誤封入了給他的信封，在他雖然很能原諒潔茜，但，我却更了解了一位少女的心情。適巧本刋編者索稿，一時無以繳卷，徵得偉的同意，便抄寄塞責。我想，素以坦白大方著稱的潔茜，不會反對吧？</p>
<p>因爲不敢掠人之美，合亟叙明原委如上</p>
<p>（一）親愛的偉：</p>
<p>吿訴你一個好消息，我們學校要演戲。陸先生選定「茶花女」，並且派我演瑪格麗，陸先生眞太好了，讓我演這麼好的角色。</p>
<p>我常常倦厭我平淡的生活，我想逃出這生活尋找書本中的生活，也想嚐嚐藝人的生活。</p>
<p>我太興奮了，我好像有許多話要說，但是我找不出一種文字能寫出我訴說的話。</p>
<p>祝你的甜夢！</p>
<p>—潔茜</p>
<p>（二）我親愛的偉：</p>
<p>我們的戲已經在排演了，我發現演阿芒的男角是一個Freshman，他的名字呌盧波，他是一個非常漂亮而可愛的靑年，我喜歡他，但是我不喜歡他演我的愛人阿芒，因爲他太年靑了，他比我的弟弟還小哪！我怎能和他演戀愛！</p>
<p>—你的潔茜</p>
<p>（三）親愛的波：</p>
<p>感謝你所給我的光明如陽光的新思想，牠復熾了我舊日的心情，願你永遠保持着你的新。</p>
<p>—你誠實的潔茜</p>
<p>（四）親愛的老師：</p>
<p>我不知藝人們如何過他們的生活，他們每天演兩塲，他們如何能在剩下的很少時間中享受自己的生活！</p>
<p>我討厭戲劇生活，牠毀減了我戀愛的友情，現在我已領了瑪格麗和亞蒙間的愛，一天排演一塲已足够使我忘記自己，我已忘了我是潔茜。</p>
<p>—學生潔茜</p>
<h3>易卜生的處女作</h3>
<p>— 符泊</p>
<p>易卜生二十歲時，還在格里姆斯塔德的一家藥店裏充學徒，歐洲革命思想的傳佈，燃燒了他的年靑的心，便偷閑在深夜的燭火下，從事革命性的創作。他的處女作名「卡狄麗娜」（Katilina），是三幕的悲劇詩。</p>
<p>二十二歲時他自費出版，僅售去了三十册，他用的筆名是「勃爾尼允萊，皮耶爾姆」。</p>
<h3>小名言</h3>
<p>— 陳因譯</p>
<p>一個聰明的女人，有時要離開她丈夫一些時候，使他想念她的好處，但也不離開太久使他想另找安慰。</p>
<p>一個女人開始隱瞞年紀的時候，已經是說明了她的年紀。</p>
<h3>日長靜山靜圖</h3>
<p>— 應野苹</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血209</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「很好，您着實應當休息一下。」</p>
<p>「可是你得煩心，囑咐剛才那個下女，到九點半來喚醒我。」</p>
<p>「多睡半小時罷，我到十句鐘來，我們還得商量一下正式的節目哩。」她有另外的主張。</p>
<p>鶴見可沒有眞睡。同萍子早餐之後，他回到自己屋子裏，把門闔上，躺在那隻背窗的大軟榻上，不斷地抽烟捲，一手仍舊拈着那張字條。</p>
<p>「0915！」</p>
<p>「華懋飯店」四個字，問題很簡單，只須問問人，就知道是什麼地點，什麼性質。只這個號碼很奇特。他認爲絕對不是房間號碼，飯店那有這麼大的號碼？不，也許是第一樓第九百十五號房間？這飯店也許有這們多房間？不能。要不就是第九樓第十五號房間？這個「〇」又是什麼意思呢？行動又爲什麼這等神秘？</p>
<p>偌大一個萬歲館，只有兩隻電話，而且都在管事長的屋子裏。鶴見不願去驚動人，更不願人知道有這麼一回事。</p>
<p>「0915」，鶴見把這號碼，顚倒去念着。新地方，新人物！一切都是那們不順眼。他又想到那個拋紙球的少年：臉上那樣辦，衣衫那般襤褸，牙齒却那們整齊雪白；而且舉動文靜，鎭定，敏捷，自然。說話，拋紙球，敬禮，返身溜走，一步一步動作，有决序，當然也是有計劃的。</p>
<p>「爲什麼不下車去追？……汽車勤務爲什麼竟沒察覺？不錯，他忙着搬放乎提箱，腦筋簡單，知覺遲鈍，又專心在服務上，安置了手提箱，還要忙着開車，心無二用，不是嗎？……」</p>
<p>「可是，當時自己爲什不下車去追？」鶴見質問着自己；想去想來，反而困惑起來。困惑了一會，又竭力追憶剛才上車的那一幕；追憶，狠着追憶。推想了好一會，他才得到幾個答案。</p>
<p>他認爲鍘自己的動作是對的：他對於那個少年的舉動，沒有激烈的反應，一，他要保持着冷靜態度，見怪不怪；在東北，在日本，經過奇奇怪怪的事還少了嗎？爲什麼小題大做，輕舉妄動？他認爲不下車追赶少年，第一個理由，乃由歷來的經騐，所養成的冷靜，制止了他粗忽的反應所致。</p>
<p>這一點也玩得過去。那麼還有其他理由嗎？也許太疲倦的原因？本來，在一星期內，他就沒有好好休息過。在東京，那種緊張的環境，無論醒着睡着，神經絕對無法休息。回到東北，回到北平，不斷的失意，不斷的新問題，接二連三發生起來，煩惱，困惑，在心下像野草一般，滋生蔓長，此外，又滲和着自己同志們的溫情，說不完的故事，聽不完的報吿，在睡眠中，神經也是興奮的。自己並不是鋼鐵籌成的機器人，緊張，刺戟，困惱，興奮之後，又有十小時左右的長途跋涉，要說不疲倦，誰也不能相信。眞的疲倦了，一切反應當然要遲鈍起來。</p>
<p>疲倦的這條理由，也似乎能設得過去，只是還不能澈底說服自已。</p>
<p>「對了！」他又想着一條道理：他記得當時萍間他「這是什麼玩藝」？他的見解是「大概沒有惡意」。也許當時就是這種見解，止住了他素有的劇烈反應動作？</p>
<p>然而當時爲什麼產生這種見解呢？自己同然吃過一驚，萍子不也是受了一大驚嗎？萍子沒有主張追問那少年，常然由於自己的態度和答覆，像冰一樣冷。然而自已看見一個合作的女子，受了驚嚇，竟絲毫無動於中，是個什麼道理？是的，也許是怕的在劇烈動作之下，其結果或更將呌萍子受驚，譬如那少年傢伙，見有人追他，一下搯出手槍，評砰兩下；或竟是一顆小型炸彈，扔了過來，旬地一響，事情豈不更糟？萍子豈不更要着慌？</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>一盛夏，小孩子熱得滿身是汗，「聰明」的母親把孩子拖到天井裏曬、太陽，據說是想把衣服上的汗曬乾。</p>
<p>這個聰明的主意，可能有成功的時候，不幸這孩子的福薄，衣服還沒有被曬乾，便躺在地上奄奄一息了。母親揮着扇子，走出來嘆了一口聲說</p>
<p>「這孩子眞懶，怎麼就睡着了」</p>
<p>以上說的如果惹你發笑的話，可能是一個笑話。</p>
<p>笑話成爲笑話，在於說笑話的人，自己不笑。</p>
<p>有些人還沒有開始說笑話，自己先開始笑了一大頓。這樣可能別人也跟着笑，可是好笑的不是笑話，而是那一大頓莫名其妙的傻笑。</p>
<p>作爲當代的時論家，也是傳記家魯特維希先生有幾句很有價値的話，他說：</p>
<p>一假若兩個人在看歌劇，一個坐在包廂第一排，一個坐在廊座，他們對於同一歌劇的印象之不同，會正如一個觀察當代者與一個研究歷史者對於同一時代的印象之不同一樣。兩者俱有好處，在下面的人可以無打擾地聽演員底聲音，聽到他底呼吸，看他底特徵的表演，因而對劇中的英雄所知道的比其他的人多；但另一人則可以看見全劇在舞台上展開」。</p>
<p>道是一段極有價値的話，我們觀察一切，無論是當前的政治乃至於其他各方面，我們總得保留住着兩個位子。一在下面，一在廊座，而在同一幕戲中常常換座觀看。</p>
<p>在維也納，一八二七年三月十四日，貝多芬致莫希爾斯信的後面，羅曼羅蘭稽考文獻寫了一段注脚：</p>
<p>「貝多芬此時快要不名一文了，他寫信給倫敦的音樂協會和當時在英國的莫希爾斯，要求他們替他舉辦一個音樂會籌一筆款子。倫敦的音樂協會慷慨地立即寄給他一百鎊作爲預支，貝多芬衷心感動。據一個朋友說，他收到這封信的時候，合着雙手，因快樂與感激而嚎啕大哭起來，在塲的人都爲之心碎感動之下，舊創又迸發了，但他還要念出信稿，敎人寫信去感謝豪夾的英國人分擔他悲慘的命運。他答應他們製作一支大曲；第十交響樂’一支前奏曲，還有聽他們指定就是。他說：「我將心中懷着從未有過的熱愛替他們寫作那些樂曲」。這封覆信是三月十八日寫的，同月廿六日他就死了」。（全據傳雷譯文）</p>
<p>這偉大而素來矜持的樂聖；陰黯的人世，內心的寂寞可知。他終於接受別人的慷慨，爲了區區一百鎊，他會快樂感激而嚎啕大哭。這正可以說明，這人世太無溫暖；一點點菲薄的反響，就使敏感的詩人不知而已地激動了。</p>
<h3>關於實物配售</h3>
<p>— 丁人</p>
<p>一般公敎人員生活的清苦，已經是一致公認的事實了。多少年來含辛茹苦，站在各自的崗位上，肩負着支持一個國家的重任，這功績是不能算小的了。但是收入的微薄，往往不及一個黃包車夫，說來不能不替他們辛酸。</p>
<p>勝利以後，大家都按照生活指數領取薪給，公敎人員却還是拿着由政府特定的倍數與基本數發放，其中數如以八十元底薪計算，只有三千餘倍的樣子，你想，如何可與跑馬似的物價去抗衡呢。雖然，有着每隔三個月調整一下的規定，但是調整後的薪金，往往還是落在物價的後面。雖然，政府最近有配售實物的舉措，但我們覺得對一般公敎人員的帮助，還是不够實際的，尤其對低級的公務人員，反而成了一種贅累，就拿今天（廿六日）報上所發表的配售物品來說，米·油·鹽·糖·煤球·布等幾種東西，你要想買全它，那末，一個月的收入，的確還不够應付這些「實物」，這種苦况，要是我是公務人員，就只有眼淚往肚子裏琉了。</p>
<p>現在，我們退一步來想，就事論事，那末，除了因配售實物而可能忽略了三個月調整一决薪津以外，單拿配售這件事所可能發生的流弊來說，我們不能不提供一點意見：</p>
<p>第一，因配售實物而專設機構，多添了一筆龐大的開支，這是不是合理的打算，我們可無從回答。</p>
<p>第二，因配售而增加不少三百六十行以外的生意人—收買配售票者，因而弄得公務員無心辦公，整天的祗是在票價上打算盤，聽市面，這些現象，在今天我們已可預測，這降低行政效率的前途，也不能不加以注意。</p>
<p>第三，因分發配售票而發生向上浮報，對下尅扣等情，在今後也不無可能。</p>
<p>第四，實物的好壞，也會引起大家不少的麻煩。</p>
<p>在即將配售的前夜，我們提出這些淺見來請當局鄭重攷慮，嚴密處置，大概不會無益的吧。</p>

<p>一九三九以前，世界各國女子有選舉權的共三十三國，以後陸續增加了十四國，現在已有四十七國的女子有選舉權。但阿根廷，比利時，瑞士等十八國的女子，仍無選舉權。我國有古語云：「新婚不如小別」。瑞典政府對此頗表同感，最近通過法律，規定凡已婚之女子，每年得休假十日，這十日休假中，如她的丈夫不能陪伴在側，則政府可以供給她休假期內一切費用。</p>

<h3>大時代小插曲　動物逃不了難</h3>
<p>— 亞慕</p>
<p>台北事件，現在是好像一塲暴風雨一樣消逝過去了。</p>
<p>許多的同胞，吃了苦頭，受了驚嚇，自然是不消說得。誰也料想不到的是，連外省人家裏的大小動物，以及動物園裏的牲畜，由於當時牠們的主人或管理人員都紛紛逃難的原故，便不曾照顧牠們，不曾豢養牠們，同時牠們又逃跑不了，於是只好通挨了好些日子的餓，因而感受到最嚴重的死的威脅。</p>
<p>如果這些牲畜，有知覺，有敏感，又會開口的話，倒不知道將說些什麼哩。</p>
<p>這正是大時代的一個小揷曲！　總之，暴風雨裏，鷄犬不寗，那是事勢所必然，如果牲畜有知，當然不免要有難乎其爲牲畜之感吧。</p>
<h3>霓虹燈放光</h3>
<p>— 芸</p>
<p>過去因爲節電，所以除了國際飯店屋頂上的「禮義廉恥」四個大字外，其餘的戶外霓虹燈都是不許放光的。</p>
<p>四月一日起，因爲電力已比較充沛，戶外霓虹燈也便可開放了。</p>
<p>沒有戶外霓虹燈，夜間走在路上，陰沉沉，黑悠悠，冷淸淸，覺得那市面眞是何等蕭條，何等凄涼。</p>
<p>如今戶外霓虹燈又可放出燦爛的光輝了，但這是否算市面又已繁榮了呢？</p>

<h3>「秋水伊人」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>「中大華」出品的幾部影片，沒有一部是水凖以上的片子，不論劇本，演出與技術，這部「秋水伊人」又是部草率的劣等片。</p>
<p>編劇者石麟簡直是莫明其妙的寫下了這故事，內容的空虛與幼稚，使人啼笑皆非，劇中主要人物何平與老法官司等都有着莫明其妙的矛盾，尤其是那個老法官，而劇情的發展，更是幼稚得可笑。警察的追捕逃犯，完全是捉迷藏，飛機票隨便可以在鄉間購得，何平抓到了殺人的强盜又把他放了，法官的姪女一見了那個逃犯竟愛上了他，……諸如這些例子，簡直荒謬到不能使人相信的地步。這樣脫離現實的故事，十年前求諸於文明戲也甚少見。</p>
<p>演出上，也是一幅幅拙劣的連環畫，再加上導演鄭小秋的低能，他簡直不懂得電影技巧，談不上導演手法的運用。只拼命抓了些低級的噱頭塞給觀衆，結果使全片的進行像一個口才拙劣而又嚕囌的老太婆在講着又臭又畏的故事。</p>
<p>剪接攝影，錄音，壞到不能再壞的程度，演員們全部是廣東國語，再加上十分之六的對白聽不淸楚，看了這部影片，無法相信它是一部最新的影片。</p>
<p>由於劇本田導演決定了演員們的命運，過去有着較佳成績的李淸，容小意，容玉意，在「秋水伊人」裏，一切都談不上了，留下來的只是最拙劣的演技。</p>
<h3>清慎勤</h3>
<p>— 陳德馨</p>
<p>童蒙訓曰：「當官之法，惟有三字，曰淸曰慎曰勤，知此三者，則知所以持身矣！」有人解釋：「淸乃廉潔不汚，愼乃謹守禮法，勤乃忠於查守，」請看今之官吏三字俱全者能有幾人？吾希望政府考成即以此三字爲標準；更望各級官吏刻刻以此三字自檢自肅！</p>
<h3>公道自在人心</h3>
<p>— 月鳳</p>
<p>伏波號的被撞沉，在近來海陸空大批失事的潮流之中，不過是浪花的一個而已。不算什麼希奇。它所不同於其他失事的，乃是該伏波號係英國所贈，至今尙未好好使用，現在想來，實在受之有愧。英國海軍部要員包毅德還來電慰問，愈加增重我們的羞慚。</p>
<p>然而最可痛悼的，還是那百數十名官兵，尤其是那些年輕的見習生們。他們放棄了學業，投入海軍，如今壯志未酬，就葬身海底，未免太寃枉了。古人說「死有輕於鴻毛，有重於泰山」。他們這一死算什麼呢？</p>
<p>現在是追究責任的時候了。在航行的技術上，據　　輪船長自稱，他並無錯誤。他是絕對遵照航錢行駛的。雖然明見對方誤入己方的航道，然而自己旣無錯誤，自可一直向前航行，因爲出事的責任快不在我。這使我記起有一次馬路上有一隻貓不知怎麼鑽入了電車的下面，被攔在橫七　八的鐵杆中間，跑不出來。當時電車一開，此貓必死無疑。死了以後，開車的當然沒有責任。可是那開車的和賣票的不顧準時到達的職務，更忽視了他們可以向前開駛的毫無疑問的偉大權利，却費了許多時間，兩三個人弄得渾身油膩骯髒，於將那該死的貓拖了出來，看它直跳直蹦奔回家去，然後在乘客與路人皆大歡喜之中，可可噹噹開了車。這兩者一比，究竟工人們不懂權利義務等等的價値何在，眞是差得遠了。</p>
<p>除了技術的問題以外，還有施救的問題。這是罹難家屬擬向海閩輪提出控吿的一點。據說海閩輪上的乘客，曾經表示憤慨，爲死者代抱不平。然而我們在若干乘客的談話中，却又看不到什麼東西。這就使我們惶惑了。公道自在「人心」，却不能在「人口」出現麼？</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>這時蘭的腦膜上已密佈着無數的幻想，根本到了不見不聞的境地了。她痛恨緋緋的莽撞，在晚上還獨自溜出去，找她所絕對不可能找到的銅匠，同時她又深喜那個七歲稍零的女孩的天眞可愛，爲了要修補一個玩具，竟敢在如此生疏的客地夤夜亂闖；她憂慮她會給歹人拐走，也祖心她會在敵機的轟炸和掃射下喪命。她更覺得對不起祝兆年，她的十一年前傾心相愛的情侶，她怕他已和緋緋一起炸死了；或者緋緋倒是無恙歸來，而老祝却因急於奔走尋訪，不曾躲進防空洞去，以致反而遭了意外。她一面又怪怨自己不該爲了要等待一筆希望渺茫的劃款的到達，而躭在桂林不走，以致發生如此不幸的事，並且還邂逅到早已誤傳遇難的老祝。</p>
<p>她和胡覺文的結合雖然並不完全基於愛，可是十年以來，感情一直很好，覺文待她也是極度的忠實，而他的孜孜不倦，終年埋頭研究學問的精神，更使她衷心敬佩。而聰明的緋緋和小榮也在家庭間增加了不少融和愉快的空氣。此番一別三年，蘭眞不能否認自己一些不想覺文，儘管這個書獃子還是那樣的窮，那樣的不善爲他的妻孥打算。</p>
<p>在又急又怕的痛苦的等待中，蘭也未嘗不一度怪怨過覺文的糊塗，如果他能够在桂林多等他們兩個月，事情該是怎樣好啊？緋緋也不會走失了！祝兆年也不會碰到了。</p>
<p>在迷惘恍惚之中，她忽然發現周遭的人都紛紛地站了起來，小榮的手也在她身上用力推撞着。</p>
<p>「好了！警報解除了！」她這才聽淸楚了人們的呼喊。</p>
<p>人如潮水般的擁出去，徐胖子也急着催促阿史快走。</p>
<p>「回去趕快打電話問火車站！」他一心怗念着他的木器。</p>
<p>「不妨事了！胡太太，我們一回去保管就可以看見小妹妹了！」小沈體貼萬分地向蘭安慰着，同時伸手掖起了榮兒，幫着他們母子倆從人叢中擠出去。</p>
<p>這一决榮兒並沒有跟他倔強，只不停嘴的在嚷着：「快出去找姐姐！快出去找姐姐！」</p>
<p>「多謝你，沈先生。」把作爲親戚的徐胖子和小沈比，小沈當然是個熱心人了，蘭便一路這樣向他道謝着。</p>
<p>「不妨事，都是自己人！」小沈萬分得意地說。</p>
<p>將到洞口時，和他們分開了半天的金愛麗突然顯得很興奮地跳過來，高叫着：</p>
<p>「胡太太！胡太太！」（三十）</p>

<h3>Regarding the Ten Constitutional Laws, Legislative Procedures Are Fully Completed, There Will Be Two Hundred and Twenty-Three National Supervisory Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Regarding the ten constitutional laws, after the Legislative Yuan devoted nearly a week, regardless of holidays or vacations, to careful discussions, the legislative procedures were fully completed at 8 p.m. on the 30th. When President Sun announced that this arduous task had been successfully completed through the efforts of all members, the entire Yuan responded with enthusiastic applause. After the National Government promulgates the order on April 1st, it will become the most important decree for implementing constitutional government.</p>
<p>Of these laws, four are election and recall laws, and six are organization laws. The National Assembly Organization Law was completed first, on the 25th. The National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law and the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law were passed on the 28th. On the morning of the 30th, the discussion of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law continued. Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng attended and explained the compilation of population statistics and the division of electoral districts, admitting that obtaining accurate statistical figures was indeed not easy. He himself did not insist on his own views on this matter. Regarding the division of districts, Zhang explained that he was ordered to handle this matter with a deadline of only three days, so errors were inevitable, and he was very willing to accept opinions from all sides. Then, the clauses were discussed one by one. The main point of amendment was to reduce the number of nominators for legislative candidates from 5,000 to 3,000. The original resolution that the current legislators would be natural candidates for the next term was deleted. Regarding the point that current civil and military officials should not elect people in their jurisdiction or place of service, Deng Gongli Xuan and others also put forward valuable opinions. It was resolved that such personnel who wish to be candidates must resign five months before the election period. In addition, regarding occupational representatives, Sun Jiulu and others advocated that occupational representative candidates should be limited to the rapid fire staff members of each occupation to prevent manipulation and impersonation, which was also passed by a majority. Regarding the issue of recalling legislators, some legislators believed that the number of recalls should not be too many. President Sun also believed that legislators would not necessarily commit any wrongdoings, and limiting the number of applications for recall could prevent the administrative authorities from interfering with the legislature. The entire case completed the legislative process at 12:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Next, the draft Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law was discussed. In less than an hour, all 24 articles of the entire case were passed. The law stipulates that there will be 223 supervisory committee members nationwide, elected by the provincial and municipal councils, the Mongolian and Tibetan local councils, and overseas Chinese groups. Each province can elect five members, each municipality two, each Mongolian League a total of eight, Tibet eight, and overseas Chinese eight. The Supervisory Committee election mechanism was changed from an election committee system to an election supervision system.</p>
<h3>New Organization Law of the Executive Yuan Stipulates the Establishment of Fourteen Ministries and Three Committees Cancels the Ministry of Food and the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>Then, the draft organization law of the five Yuans was discussed at a rapid pace. The most significant changes included the Executive Yuan abolishing the Ministry of Social Affairs and changing it to the Ministry of Labor. The Ministry of Food was also abolished, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was changed to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was placed under the Executive Yuan, the Supreme Court was abolished, the Examination Yuan established the Ministry of Personnel and the Examination Office, the Supervisory Yuan abolished the Office of the Supervisory Commissioner and the Supervisory Commissioner, and the Audit Department was renamed the General Audit Office.</p>
<p>According to the new Executive Yuan Organization Law, the Executive Yuan will have fourteen ministries and three committees. The heads of each ministry and committee will be political affairs committee members, and there will be five to seven political affairs committee members without portfolio. The fourteen ministries are the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Judicial Administration, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Water Conservancy, Ministry of Land Administration, and Ministry of Health. Regarding the proposal to abolish the Ministry of Social Affairs, Mr. Zhong pointed out that the Ministry of Social Affairs had been too neglectful of the welfare of farmers and workers in the past, so the ministry should be abolished and the Ministry of Labor established. The newly elected legislator Wu Wentian spoke for the first time, stating that the Ministry of Social Affairs had not done what it should have done, and only emphasized superficial work such as group weddings, which inevitably gave people the suspicion of incompetence. When the vote was taken, the abolition of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the establishment of the Ministry of Labor was passed by the largest majority. Regarding the affiliation of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Constitutional Law Committee decided during a meeting to place the ministry under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan. President Sun reported on the process of discussing this issue at the Political Consultative Conference and the National Assembly, and explained it in detail according to the Constitution, believing that the ministry should not belong to the Executive Yuan to avoid conflicting with the Constitution. Lin Bin and others put forward reasons for judicial independence and, based on the provisions of Article 82 of the Constitution, advocated that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should belong to the Judicial Yuan. It was resolved that the ministry should still belong to the Executive Yuan. Rui Yifu spoke, suggesting that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission should be changed to the Ministry of Border Affairs. Zhao Pei seconded the motion. President Sun also pointed out that the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee had made this resolution, but it received too few votes when the vote was taken, so the original plan was maintained. In addition, during the preliminary review, some people suggested merging the Resources Committee into the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and some advocated renaming it the Ministry of Heavy Industry, but it still exists independently. Furthermore, the Counsellor's Office organization was decided to be abolished, with only eight to ten counsellors. The full text of the Executive Yuan Organization Law, with sixteen articles, from proposal to passage, took less than two hours, which can be said to be extremely fast.</p>
<p>Legislative Yuan Establishes Seventeen Committees</p>
<p>After the draft Executive Yuan Organization Law was passed, the other four organization laws were passed quickly. Among them, the Legislative Yuan Organization Law was discussed for only 25 minutes. The main amendment was to increase the number of Legislative Yuan committees to seventeen, namely the Internal Affairs Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, National Defense Committee, Economic Committee, Finance Committee, Budget Committee, Education Committee, Culture Committee, Agriculture and Forestry Committee, Transportation Committee, Social Affairs Committee, Land Administration Committee, Border Affairs Committee, Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Civil Law Committee, Criminal Law Committee, Commercial Law Committee, and Legal System Committee.</p>
<p>Judicial Yuan Establishes a Grand Justice Conference</p>
<p>When discussing the Judicial Yuan Organization Law, the system of Grand Justices caused a heated debate. When the Constitutional Law Committee reviewed it, it was decided that the Judicial Yuan would establish a Grand Justice Conference, organized by nine Grand Justices, to exercise the power to interpret the Constitution and unify the interpretation of laws and decrees. The conference would elect one person as chairman, and the President of the Judicial Yuan should attend. The term of office of the Grand Justices was set at six years, and their qualifications would be determined separately by law. During the discussion, President Sun and others believed that the Constitution did not stipulate the term of office of the Grand Justices, and whether the President of the Judicial Yuan was a natural Grand Justice was indeed a problem. However, if the President of the Judicial Yuan did not attend the Grand Justice Conference, it seemed inappropriate in terms of legal principles. Liu Ke 　believed that if the President of the Judicial Yuan was a Grand Justice, it seemed to be an administrative interference. It was resolved that the organization law would not explicitly stipulate the term of office of the Grand Justices, and it would be left to the Judicial Yuan to interpret it in the future. As for whether the President of the Judicial Yuan was a Grand Justice, it was not stipulated in the meeting. It was only decided that "the President of the Judicial Yuan will be the chairman when the Grand Justice Conference is held," and the number of Grand Justices was set at nine. Furthermore, the Supreme Court will be abolished, and civil courts, criminal courts, administrative trial courts, Public Servant Disciplinary Committee and the Ministry of Judicial Administration will be established in the Judicial Yuan. In the future, appeals will be handled by the civil and criminal courts, which is also a major reform.</p>
<p>No Major Changes to the Examination Yuan Organization</p>
<p>The new Examination Yuan Organization Law does not have major changes compared to the current organization law. According to the new organization law, the Yuan will set up a Committee for Examinations and Discipline with eleven members, with a term of six years. The Examination Yuan Conference will be organized by the President, Vice-President, and Examination Committee members to comprehensively plan matters related to examinations. The Examination Yuan will establish the Ministry of Personnel and the Examination Office. The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the Examination Yuan will be six years. The original draft of the National Defense Council had a provision to replace it with the Civil Servant Protection Committee. The review cancelled this provision.</p>
<p>Supervisory Yuan Abolishes the Office of Supervisory Commissioner</p>
<p>When the draft Supervisory Yuan Organization Law was finally discussed, it was 7:30 p.m. The legislators ate snacks while discussing the articles one by one, without any fatigue. The most important change was the abolition of the Office of Supervisory Commissioner and the Supervisory Commissioner. President Sun pointed out that the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan are public opinion organs. The Supervisory Yuan is equivalent to the upper house of a foreign country and is not an official government office. Supervisory committee members are elected by local public opinion organs and should not be subject to appointment or dismissal by the government. Peng Chunshi opposed the establishment of Supervisory Commissioners. His reason was that as a member of the Supervisory Committee, everyone has the power to impeach and censure, so there is no need to establish so-called Supervisory Commissioners. It was resolved that the provisions be changed to Supervisory Committee members can go to various places to conduct roving supervision and exercise the power of impeachment and censure. Another important amendment in the organization law was that the Audit Department was changed to the General Audit Office. The Supervisory Yuan suggested establishing an investigation office, but the review decided not to establish it.</p>
<p>After all the laws and regulations completed the legislative process amidst applause, the reporters went to the podium and asked President Sun to give a brief speech on the matter. Sun was extremely tired after days of meetings (Sun was also the president of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association). When talking to reporters, he stroked his forehead with his hand and said: "We have been holding meetings for days, and I am extremely tired. The Legislative Yuan colleagues have completed the first difficult task in a very short period of time. Their spirit of hard work is worthy of praise."</p>

<h3>Youth Party Government Committee List Zuo Shunsheng Said That It May Be Agreed Today, The Democratic Socialist Party List Has Not Yet Been Submitted Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] All 15 members of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party held a forum at Zuo Shunsheng's residence yesterday afternoon to extensively exchange views on the issue of participating in the government. After the meeting, Zuo told reporters: Whether the Youth Party's list of government committee members and the Executive Yuan list will be submitted at once or submitted one after another is still under consideration, and the candidates are also being studied. Only opinions were exchanged on the 30th, and no conclusions were reached. A standing committee meeting will be held on the 31st, and a decision should be made. Zuo also said: The Youth Party hopes to reach an understanding with the government on the issue of opening up local political power before nominating a list, but this point has not been finalized and will be negotiated in Beijing again in the future. As far as the reorganization of the Executive Yuan is concerned, the Youth Party hopes to participate in more political ministries and fewer technical ministries, such as the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Ministry of Health, because the government's technical talents are already sufficient and there is no need to seek them from other parties. At the same time, the reorganization of the government itself is political. Regarding the rumor that the Youth Party will launch a thousand people to participate in the government, Zuo resolutely denied it. The reporter asked Zuo about the explanation of "traffic recovery", and Zuo replied: My personal opinion is that negotiations with the Communist Party can only be resumed after every railway in the country is opened.</p>
<p>[Also] Secretary-General Lei Zhen visited the Youth Party Office on Haige Road yesterday and had some discussions. He stayed in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The list of government committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet been submitted yesterday. According to a senior official, it is necessary to wait for the standing committee members in Beijing to return to Shanghai for consultation before a decision can be made. The current negotiations in Beijing and the submission of the list of government committee members are one matter and cannot be separated. The reorganization of local governments is very important, otherwise the simple reorganization of the central government will be meaningless. As for the rumor that some people in the party require that the implementation of the common program be guaranteed before a list can be submitted, it is indeed inaccurate, because since it is called a common program, it should be believed and abided by together. If this cannot be trusted, what other method can guarantee its implementation?</p>
<h3>The National Defense Committee Will End Soon Wang Chonghui Said That He Is Old and Needs to Rest</h3>

After returning to Beijing next month and completing the closing affairs of the Supreme National Defense Committee, he will consider advancing or retreating again.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association</h3>
<p>The Standing, Research, Investigation, and Propaganda Committees of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association held their inaugural meetings in the capital on the 29th and began to carry out their tasks to promote constitutional government. These four committees were established after the adjournment of the National Assembly to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism. Not only are their tasks important, but whether their work is completed well has a very close relationship with the constitutionalism that China will implement in the future. Moreover, judging from the composition of their members, they are organized by the Kuomintang, the Social Democratic Party, the Youth Party, and social elites, which is different from the nature of a partisan meeting and a general organization. Therefore, we, the common people, are extremely hopeful for the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association today, seeing representatives of various parties and social elites gathered together to calmly discuss the preparations necessary for the implementation of constitutionalism and to review all the regulations submitted by the Legislative Yuan regarding the implementation of constitutionalism. As President Chiang stated in his telegram to the Association, "Although a complete constitution has been drafted, how to ensure its smooth and unimpeded implementation in the future is the most important preparation work at present." "It is hoped that the Association will work together to advance and complete this great undertaking as scheduled."</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic of China was implemented on December 25th of last year, so this year is truly a "Constitutional Preparation Year," which is also the transition period from the Kuomintang's end of tutelage to the implementation of constitutional government. This year can be said to be the most important year, and the future of China's democratic politics depends entirely on whether the preparatory work this year is sufficient! However, more than three months have passed since the promulgation of the Constitution. How should we make full use of these eight months or so to fully prepare for the arduous task of implementing constitutionalism? This is the most urgent issue at present. The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has just been established, and the preparatory work is complicated. It is really a very difficult thing to complete such a great task in eight months or so. We would like to briefly describe some of our views for the reference of the gentlemen of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association.</p>
<p>First, according to the procedures for preparing for implementation as stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of China, the following tasks must also be completed in the legislative aspect: (1) Existing laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution should be promptly amended or abolished separately. (2) Within three months after the promulgation of the Constitution, five types of laws must be formulated and promulgated: (1) Regarding the organization of the National Assembly and the election and recall of representatives of the National Assembly; (2) Regarding the election and recall of the President and Vice President; (3) Regarding the election and recall of members of the Legislative Yuan; (4) Regarding the election and recall of members of the Control Yuan; (5) Regarding the organization of the five Yuan. Although these legislative tasks fall within the scope of the Legislative Yuan's powers, how to urge the Legislative Yuan to complete the above laws as scheduled? What principles should be adopted for the legislation of the above regulations? These are all tasks of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. And when we review the recent legislative work of the Legislative Yuan, the laws that have been passed include the Organic Law of the National Assembly, the Election and Recall Law of Representatives of the National Assembly, and the Election and Recall Law of the President and Vice President. There are still several laws that have not been drafted. As of today, counting from the date of the promulgation of the Constitution, it has been exactly three months, and it is an undeniable fact that it has failed to fully complete its legislative work as scheduled in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. As for the content of these laws? Are the methods adopted practical and easy to implement? There is a need to carefully study them. Although the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association does not bear actual responsibility, it should still review them so that these regulations can better adapt to the current environment and be easier to implement.</p>
<p>Second, so-called constitutionalism cannot completely rely on the constitution or laws. The most important thing is how the government and the people use them. In other words, even if there is a perfect constitution and good laws, if the government cannot implement the constitution and enforce the laws, and the people cannot abide by the constitution and laws, then so-called constitutionalism is still empty talk. Therefore, regarding the implementation of constitutionalism, in addition to making full preparations in terms of legal principles, a renovation work is also needed in the psychology of the people to cultivate a democratic atmosphere so that the people of the whole country can welcome and love democracy! Only in this way can China's politics embark on the path of true democracy. Otherwise, the constitution is the constitution, and politics is politics. The constitution and politics are disconnected, and it is only a decoration and a self-deception. Therefore, we have repeatedly advocated that this year's transition period is a period for our country to learn democracy from top to bottom. We would rather learn and progress gradually step by step, and we must not be ambitious and attempt to make a splash. We want to race with others just when we are learning to walk, because the development process of democratic politics in various countries in the world is the result of natural development. Let me first examine myself. China's political philosophy has always advocated rule by ritual and despised rule by law since ancient times. Although democratic ideas sprouted early, they were bound by inherited traditional concepts and failed to develop freely. It has become a country with relatively backward democratic politics. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, was aware of this, so he invented the period of political tutelage. The so-called political tutelage, in a nutshell, is to guide the people to learn democracy. However, since the Kuomintang successfully unified the country through the Northern Expedition, it has been under political tutelage for more than 20 years. Due to the pressure of internal and external troubles, it failed to achieve the intended goals of the political tutelage period. But today, whether it is the trend of the world or the aspirations of the people in the country, political tutelage must end, and constitutional government must be implemented. At this time, it is really the last period for our people to learn democracy and should be especially cherished. I hope that before the implementation of constitutional government on December 25th of this year, we can make full preparations to avoid failure!</p>
<p>Third, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association is jointly organized by the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social elites, and can be regarded as a party meeting. Moreover, we have seen that the members of each party are all outstanding members of their respective parties. If we want to expect this association to complete its task to promote the implementation of constitutionalism in China, then we must first hope that it itself is a group full of democratic spirit. Regardless of whether it bears actual responsibility or is just a research and investigation agency, it must ultimately appear before the people of the whole country in the form of a democratic group, as a model for the people and an example for the people. But what we call democratic spirit, the most important thing is that the leaders of each party have the demeanor of democratic politicians, being humble, without prejudice, selfless, and able to look at the big picture and plan for the big picture. Anything that is conducive to the implementation of constitutionalism, regardless of the opinions of the parties, should be supported and assisted in its success. Conversely, anything that is harmful to the development of democracy in China, no matter how beneficial it is to the party, should still be resolutely opposed. Only in this way can China's democratic politics have a bright future, and the disputes between parties will not become an obstacle to democracy. However, when we face the current situation, we cannot but be apprehensive in our hearts, and we always feel that some party leaders are indecisive and hesitant before making a final decision; even after the decision is made, they are still worried about gains and losses; they want to move forward but do not advance, which is really the most pessimistic phenomenon at present. Taking the reorganization of the government as an example, three months have already been wasted, and the list of parties participating in the government has not yet been submitted, which makes us cannot but regret!</p>
<p>In short, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association is a party meeting during the transition period, and it should give full play to its role to achieve its great cause of preparing for constitutional government!</p>

<h3>Agenda Determined for Foreign Ministers' Conference - Major German Issues to Be Discussed Within a Deadline - Chairman of the Reparations Committee States Difficulties in Work</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 29th] Under pressure from US Secretary of State Marshall, the four foreign ministers, after a short meeting today, agreed to discuss two major issues in the two-stage talks that will begin next Monday: (1) Germany as an economic unit, including reparations, and a review of industrial standards, including restrictions on military industries; (2) The form and scope of the German Provisional Government. The discussion of the above two issues must be completed by April 2 at the latest. If a common ground cannot be reached, then the fate of the conference has been sealed as far as the German issue is concerned. Authoritative sources say that if Marshall's strategy of focusing on the most urgent German issues does not make progress, there is ample reason to believe that he will pack his bags and return home. Conversely, if the thorough efforts at the beginning of next week reveal some constructive prospects, Marshall may propose another deadline to resolve other disputes as the conference continues. In addition, the four foreign ministers also appointed a special subcommittee to discuss minor issues (German political democratization, denazification, population transfer, refugees, etc.) and draft regulations by April 3. The US representative to the committee is Marshall's economic advisor Mason, the French representative is Alphand, the British representative is Lawberson, and the Soviet representative is General Sokolovsky. Regarding the issue of a unified Germany, the prospects for reaching an agreement are not good. It is heard that the US delegation is willing to make some concessions to the Soviet Union on the issue of using Germany's current production for reparations, but in exchange for the Soviet Union's compromise on the issue of German political power. It remains to be seen whether the Soviet Union will accept this compromise.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] When the Foreign Ministers' Conference on German issues opened this morning, Allied Reparations Committee Chairman Luais reported on the administrative difficulties of the committee. He pointed out that the member governments were dissatisfied with the progress of the distribution of reparations, and the member governments hoped to quickly resume the delivery of reparations. If the current situation continues, it will completely fail the reparations plan stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. He suggested that the Reparations Committee should report directly to the Foreign Ministers' Conference so that it could provide advice directly to the Foreign Ministers' Conference without going through the German Control Council. He also pointed out that the regulations on emergency payment of reparations have been repeatedly violated, and the original intention of the Potsdam Agreement has been completely ignored. He said that the reasons why the Potsdam reparations policy cannot be implemented are, firstly, the political orders that everyone knows, and secondly, the administrative orders that are not well known, the latter being even more important than the former.</p>
<h3>British and Soviet Union Negotiate Amendments to Alliance Treaty</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky, Goronsky, British Ambassador Peterson, and Assistant Foreign Minister Hart held the first negotiation on amending the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty at the Soviet Foreign Ministry on Thursday. The two sides held a second meeting yesterday. A British spokesman said that he hoped that the negotiations could be completed before the end of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is reported that the main proposals of both sides for amending the alliance treaty are as follows: The Soviet Union hopes to amend Article 4 of the alliance treaty, that is, the provisions for mutual assistance between Britain and the Soviet Union when Germany launches an aggression, so that this obligation does not have to depend on the obligations stipulated by the United Nations organization. The British side requires that the validity period of the alliance treaty be extended from 20 years to 50 years. According to this negotiation, it is the result of the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Stalin earlier this week. If the treaty is negotiated and agreed upon, it will be submitted to Stalin again before Bevin leaves Moscow.</p>
<h3>Reviewing and Completing Report on Austrian Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>The Issue of German Property in Austria Remains to Be Discussed</p>

As for the most difficult issue, namely the definition of German property in Austria, the Foreign Ministers' Conference has not yet drafted a report.</p>
<h3>Franco-Soviet Dignitaries Gather</h3>

<h3>American Radio Station in Munich Sabotaged - Russian-Language Programs Broadcast to South America</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Assistant Secretary of State Banden revealed: A special advisor to the State Department stationed in Munich informed the State Department that the button of the American relay station in Munich was turned, causing the radio waves originally intended to be broadcast to the Soviet Union to be directed to South America. The authorities are now thoroughly investigating this case to avoid similar incidents from happening again. The Munich relay station has six antennas, two of which are used for broadcasting to the Soviet Union. One of them was being used to test a new wavelength for broadcasting to the Soviet Union, but it lost its effectiveness between March 17 and 25. It was only discovered that it had been sabotaged and was corrected on March 25.</p>
<h3>Germans in the Ruhr Continue Hunger Demonstration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Dortmund, Ruhr Area, 29th] There were more German demonstrations here today due to food shortages. Local miners' union secretary Keilhof addressed the protesters, suggesting launching a one-day collective hunger demonstration by all trade unions in the entire British military district. The protesters were received by Major Wilson, the local British military commander, who said that the wheat supply would improve in the coming days. The Dortmund Food Bureau chief said that flour could arrive late on the weekend, and representatives of factories and consumers could attend the city council meeting next Tuesday to present their food opinions.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister Reprimands Communism</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 29th Dispatch] Turkish Prime Minister Burke recently delivered a moving speech to students at Istanbul University, attacking extremists on both the left and right and strongly advocating the middle way. He attacked the extreme right-wing Pan-Turkism, which advocates uniting Turkish-Anatolia-Soviet-Central Asia and Northwest China into a large Turkish country. Burke said: Racial nationalism is a complete violation of democracy and is irrational and imperialistic. He spoke of communism, saying: Communist parties in every country are eroding their national institutions. They conceal their destruction of national self-consciousness with the sugarcoating of democratic socialism. We should guard against people who cooperate with foreign countries. All Turks should take national unity and integrity as the basic principles of the country. Communism denies nationalism, and racialism exaggerates nationalism, so an effective remedy is a clear sense of nationalism. Turks are not selfish and despise others. On the contrary, Turkish citizens should support international organizations and strive for the unity of civilized countries.</p>
<h3>Investigation Committee on Anti-American Activities Proves: American Communist Party Obeys Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The House Un-American Activities Committee today revealed evidence proving that the American Communist Party is a spy for the Soviet government. Among the evidence is an order issued by the Communist International in 1927 to the American Communist Party to oppose the American imperialist counter-revolutionary war in China. In total, ninety-two instructions issued by Moscow influencing the activities of the American Communist Party have been disclosed. Representative Thomas, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, frankly told reporters that, based on the report released this time, it can be proved that the American Communist Party is undoubtedly Moscow's fifth column. The report stated: "When dealing with communism, we must recognize that this is a world revolution movement commanded by a foreign government." The evidence cited includes documents published by the Communist Party and former Communist Party members, as well as Stalin's remarks. Among them, the instruction issued by the Communist International to the American Communist Party in 1927 stated that the party should urgently engage in the greatest struggle against the American imperialists' intervention and counter-revolutionary war in China and Nicaragua. The report of the House Un-American Activities Committee directly pointed out that the American Communist Party is a spy for a foreign government commanding the world revolution, and the British Communist Party Congress held in London in February of this year was actually a meeting of the Communist International. The report also stated: Fifteen to twenty years ago, the Communist Party relied only on the weak Soviet government for support, and its activities did not need to be taken seriously, and it could be naturally eliminated by democratic methods. By 1947, this totalitarian bridgehead had penetrated deeply into the labor movement, government, political parties, newspapers, radio stations, movies, schools, churches, and various social organizations. Because Communist Party members are strictly disciplined, they hold important positions in popular organizations, and rely on the Soviet government, the world's major power. Therefore, the power of the Communist Party has exceeded the proportion of its numbers. The American communist movement is based on the discipline required by the Soviet Communist Party, and its goal is to abolish the current economic democratic government of the United States and establish a Soviet dictatorship. If the strength of the American Communist Party is fully mobilized and given significant assistance by a powerful foreign country, it will be able to seriously disrupt the economic and social life of the United States, and even damage the effectiveness of the American military. The American Communist Party has always been an integral part of the Moscow-controlled worldwide communist organization, unconditionally obeying Moscow's orders, and using its manpower and resources for the disposal of the Soviet government or the Communist International, and obeying orders to operate in any part of the world. The report also stated: The Soviet "New Times" magazine, published in five languages, has been recognized as the successor of the Communist International, and its editorials are regarded as maxims by communist parties around the world.</p>
<h3>Requesting Congressional Appropriation for Investigating Communist Party Funds</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, United Press] President Truman will soon request Congressional appropriation for the funds needed to implement his policy of eliminating communists and fellow travelers from government positions. The cost of the federal government's loyalty investigation of civil servants is estimated to be approximately $25 million.</p>
<h3>Anti-Communist Sentiment in America Intensifies Daily</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] It is learned that preparations for resisting communism in the United States have been increasingly strengthened in the past few days. According to unofficial opinions, it is believed that the US government has actually announced that, in addition to Greece and Turkey, Germany and Korea are also the main lines for resisting communism. Acting Secretary of State Acheson once declared: Assuming that the Soviet Union has no intention of cooperating with the United States on the unification of Korea, the only way for the United States is to make South Korea increasingly prosperous and make the Soviet occupation zone pale in comparison. Assistant Secretary of the Army Hiltring, who is responsible for occupation affairs, told the Appropriations Committee yesterday that the United States must continue to engage in economic warfare with the Soviet Union in Germany for at least three years. American public opinion is now firmly supporting the opinions of the State Department and Congress. The government's method of resisting communism is to prove with facts how much better the people in the occupation zone live under a democratic system. All indications now show that Republican members, who once aimed to reduce taxes, will also support President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey at any cost. Most of the controversy against Truman's plan is only a formality.</p>
<h3>Republican Senator Monnet Suggests a Meeting Between the Two Giants, Truman and Stalin; Truman Says He Has No Such Intention at Present</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Republican Senator Monnet urged President Truman today at the House Foreign Affairs Committee to personally meet with Soviet Marshal Stalin in order to eliminate the differences between communist Soviet Union and democratic countries. However, President Truman told reporters that he has no intention of participating in any great power conference recently, and that negotiations between leaders of various countries would be useless at present. Monnet said, "I feel that only through such talks can we obtain a clear outline of the scope of the agreement that should be established between major countries at this critical period in international relations." The US government's $400 million aid plan to Greece and Turkey is tantamount to an action facing the edge of an international march toward communism. Similar situations, such as Iran, Korea, China, and other countries that will be in similar situations, such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Lebanon, Egypt, etc., should also be considered. Monnet continued, "The appropriate place to contain the aggressive forces of communism should be in Moscow, and an understanding should be reached on the following matters: (1) Effective international guarantees prohibiting the production and use of atomic bombs; (2) The United Nations mechanism guarantees the autonomous privileges of independent countries; (3) The boundaries and foreign policies prevailing in the post-war world."</p>
<h3>The Dodecanese Islands Will Be Returned to Greece Today</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 29th] The Dodecanese Islands will be returned to Greece on the 31st of this month.

The injured were all within one or two kilometers of the center of the bomb's impact.</p>
<h3>US Fleet to Sail to Northern Europe, Participants are the Newest US Warships</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The US Navy Department announced that it will send two new battleships and the most modernized aircraft carriers to the waters of Northern Europe in June for training cruises. Admiral Conolly, commander of the US Navy in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, said that the new battleships are the "New Jersey" and "Wisconsin", and the aircraft carriers are the "Randolph" and the "Essex" or "Kearsarge".

Each of the two mother ships has a displacement of 27,000 tons and can carry 100 aircraft.</p>
<h3>US Opinion Poll Shows Support for Aid to Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] The results of a recent US opinion poll show that the public largely supports President Truman's plan to aid Greece, but regrets that the Greek issue was not first submitted to the United Nations for review. The survey results showed that 60% of people support financial aid to Greece, but do not support sending a military advisory group to train the troops in the two countries, and hope that the use of American loans will be supervised by American experts on the spot.</p>

<h3>Navy Secretary Forrestal Declares: US Navy is Fearless, Europe, Asia, and Africa Cannot Be Dominated by Totalitarian Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, St. Louis, 30th] According to Navy Secretary Forrestal's announcement today: "The United States should provide political, economic, and, if necessary, military assistance to countries that want to maintain a free system." Forrestal referred to President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey, saying: "If the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa are dominated by a totalitarian country, then the 'Western Hemisphere' will also be in a difficult position to resist these countries." He also said: "But when the oceans remain open, it will be difficult for these countries to gain control of Europe, Asia, and Africa." The Secretary of the Navy also said: "The United States currently has one aircraft carrier mobile unit in the Pacific and another in the Atlantic, ready to be dispatched at any time."</p>

<h3>Britain Has a Huge Import Surplus</h3>

<h3>Severe Famine in the Soviet Union, Many Farmers Starve to Death</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 29th] French officials familiar with the Soviet Union said today that in recent weeks, thousands of farmers have died of starvation in four regions of the Soviet Union: Ukraine, Lower Volga, Upper Volga, and Western Siberia. The famine was caused by severe droughts in the grain-producing areas of the European part of the Soviet Union last year, and most of the wheat harvest in Siberia was destroyed by torrential rains. Earlier, a telegram from Moscow quoted an official statement saying that there was a nationwide drought, resulting in an extremely serious food situation. The situation deteriorated during Christmas last year, and the Soviet government began slaughtering a large number of household animals on an unprecedented scale. There are two reasons: one is that livestock lacked forage and were dying, and the second is that animal meat could be used for human consumption. As a result, although meat consumption in Soviet cities was higher than in previous years, the number of livestock after the war was far below normal, and the reduction was huge. It is estimated that one-third of the total number of Soviet livestock were slaughtered in the winter. People also feel a shortage of food, but they cannot tell the outside world, which makes the situation worse. Soviet leaders believe that at a time of international tension, revealing domestic weaknesses will undermine the plan. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot even ask for help.</p>
<h3>World Trade War</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department</p>
<p>The United States is currently engaged in a war of great magnitude, the outcome of which will have an impact on our lives no less significant than the war triggered by the Pearl Harbor incident. The weapons we use in this war are not battleships, airplanes, or atomic bombs, but gleaming new car washes, refrigerators, machine tools, newsprint, and all kinds of manufactured goods.</p>
<p>In this commercial war, our enemies are the other victorious nations of World War II. The battlefield is Latin America, an area of eight million square miles, which has not suffered war damage, with an estimated seven billion dollars in cash, and rich in resources and commercial opportunities. In a world hindered by trade treaties, power politics, and spheres of influence, Latin America is the only free market where we can compete freely with our enemies.</p>
<p>During the War</p>
<p>During World War II, the British and Soviet governments agreed to cooperate in purchasing materials in Latin America. They jointly purchased tin from Bolivia, meat from Argentina, rubber from Brazil, copper from Chile, and other war materials. They at least kept prices under control, preventing them from skyrocketing. However, when the war ended, the cooperative purchasing agreement also ended, and each country was only concerned with its own interests.</p>
<p>Immediately, Bolivia demanded higher tin prices from the United States, and then Argentina notified Bolivia that it must sell tin and rubber to Argentina, otherwise food supplies would be cut off.</p>
<p>International trade is not just about finding out who has goods and trying to buy them; similarly, selling goods in the world market is not as simple as supplying goods to the market. Now it is governments that are engaged in buying and selling; transactions are no longer a question of what to sell or at what price, but what kind of political relationship exists. Fair competition has been eliminated by countries that loudly proclaim "free trade."</p>
<p>In 1945, the United States, at the Mexico City Conference, allowed assistance to Latin American countries in implementing industrialization, in exchange for free trade among the countries of the Americas. The United States provided them with loans and industrial equipment and helped them establish factories, hoping that the governments of Latin American countries would allow merchants to trade freely under fair competition. However, European countries ignored these merchants and conducted transactions with their governments.</p>
<p>Current Situation in South America</p>
<p>Therefore, when American merchants try to buy raw materials from Latin America, they find that the government has already signed trade contracts with European countries, leaving no room for private manufacturers to intervene, leaving American merchants at a loss. Because private enterprises, no matter how large, cannot compete with foreign governments or another private enterprise supported by a foreign government. In this commercial war, European merchants and their governments fight shoulder to shoulder, making full use of political pressure, military espionage, and the sacred diplomatic bag of tricks.</p>
<p>The United States must not only compete with the governments of Latin American countries individually, but also faces collective competitors in Argentina. To fix prices, Britain, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands are planning to agree to jointly purchase fats and oils from Argentina to counter Perón's policy of choosing customers and selling at the best price.</p>
<p>British and Soviet Strategies</p>
<p>No Allied nation suffered greater commercial sacrifices during the war than Britain. In 1943, Britain's exports were only a quarter of what they were in 1938. Britain's major industries had been bombed, overseas investments had been sold or mortgaged to buy war materials, and most of its merchant ships had sunk to the bottom of the sea. Britain needed to import almost all of its raw materials from abroad. Under these circumstances, it is probably impossible for Britain to compete with American industrial nations on fair terms.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, of course, concentrated its trade activities on the Western Hemisphere buying agencies of the government, creating the Soviet economic sphere of influence, which is reflected in the growing power of the Communist Party in Latin American groups.</p>
<p>Control Policy</p>
<p>During the war, the United States' neighbors could not obtain the necessary manufactured goods, so they began to manufacture them themselves. The governments, seeing that their products could not compete with American goods, erected tariff barriers and adopted other protectionist policies. Mexico announced tax-free exports of new industrial products and has already exported textiles to other countries in the Americas to compete with the United States. Brazil learned to manufacture destroyers, tanks, and freight cars from the United States, and is now able to manufacture its own cars, airplanes, and other industrial products, and no longer purchases them from the United States. Argentina adopted an import license system, issuing import permits when important American goods are needed, but the Argentine government can refuse to issue these permits at any time and issue them to other countries that President Perón considers politically favorable. Peru also adopted an import license system, and Colombia banned the use of US dollars for luxury goods. Governments throughout Latin America in the Western Hemisphere are gradually adopting strict control over the national economy, as if the United States is the only country in the world that advocates free trade.</p>
<p>Despite the guarantees made by representatives of various countries at the Mexico City Conference to implement an "international program to eliminate trade barriers," the above-mentioned situations actually occurred. When the United States transformed its wartime industries into peacetime industries, it was merely a technical change, but other countries not only changed their factories, but also changed their entire political and diplomatic structures.</p>
<p>Britain has also launched a fierce economic war. Reuters, a British news agency subsidized by the British government, provides news to Latin American newspapers and radio stations at a much lower price than American news agencies. Reuters uses its readers and listeners not only to advertise British goods, but also to skillfully spread disguised anti-American propaganda, causing the United States to lose many friends.</p>
<p>American Attitude</p>
<p>The attitude of the International Trade Policy Division of the United States Department of State is: the scope of international trade should be expanded and operated by private enterprises, and all countries should be treated equally without discrimination. As far as the United States itself is concerned, this is a very good attitude, but I am afraid that other countries may not agree.</p>
<p>They said: "We need to export a lot because our production is too large. To keep our people from becoming unemployed, we have to sell our goods abroad. We can also produce and sell goods cheaper than other countries? In a free trade world, we will exclude others and monopolize the market. So they set up agreements on their own to shut us out, thinking of resisting. But we can decide for ourselves how to do business within the borders of the United States. If we don't approve of what other countries are doing, then there is nothing we can do, because we don't use our political power in Latin America to achieve economic goals."</p>
<p>They are right, America's attitude reflects America's lack of foreign policy. We hope to achieve the goal of exporting 20 million US dollars a year, so that 12 million Americans will not lose their jobs, the same number as the unemployed in 1932.</p>
<p>But if we expect the world to wait for us to solve the trade problem first, we are going to be disappointed. Americans who feel smug looking at new cars parked on the docks ready to be shipped abroad really don't know that we are only exporting one out of every nineteen new cars, while France, for example, is exporting two out of every three cars.</p>

<h3>Beijing and Shanghai Post Offices Actively Improve, Implementing Zonal Delivery System, Simplifying Procedures to Increase Postal Delivery Speed and Convenience for the Public, Director of the Post Office Hosted a Press Conference Yesterday to Report Details</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Postal Administration hosted a press conference yesterday to report on the recent construction and future improvement plans of the post office. According to Director Li Jinlu, who stated at the meeting: The post office has been in operation for more than 50 years. After years of gradual construction and improvement, it has reached its current scale. However, the post office is closely related to the public, so all facilities are based on the premise of the public. Even during the Anti-Japanese War, whether in the front or rear, or in occupied areas, the work of the post office was never interrupted. It has been more than a year since the victory, and the fluctuations in prices have affected the post office, making it difficult to reach the ideal stage, that is, not being utilized by every citizen. Therefore, in the future, we hope that the national public and the postal authorities will cooperate closely and exert even greater efforts. According to Wang Yuguang, assistant to the director of the bureau, there are seven major goals for operating the post office: (1) speed, (2) accuracy, (3) safety, (4) universality, (5) thoughtfulness, (6) convenience, and (7) inexpensiveness. The Post Office Standing Committee is currently striving to improve based on this principle. At the same time, it announced that in order to simplify the work of sorting postal items and to increase delivery speed, a zonal delivery system will be implemented in Beijing and Shanghai starting today. The entire city of Shanghai will be divided into 18 delivery zones, each represented by a number, and each zone will have a designated post office to handle the delivery affairs of that zone. This system is widely used in major cities in Europe and the United States, and it can not only increase delivery speed but also reduce mis-sorting incidents. It is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai will indicate the delivery zone number on the envelope in parentheses when sending mail in the future, and also notify the sender to add the same notation on the return mail. For example, "Shanghai (11) No. 100 Guizhou Road, sent or received by so-and-so." The post office has printed a directory of Shanghai delivery zones and street names for public request, or you can inquire at the nearest post office.</p>
<p>Delivery Zone · Number and Name of Post Office</p>
<p>Regarding the delivery zone number and the name of the designated delivery post office for one of these plans, the following is listed: (0) Administration Bureau, (1) Huaihai Road Branch, (4) Dongchang Road Branch, (5) Wusong Road Branch, (9) Zhongzheng North Second Road Branch, (10) (1) Fujian Middle Road Branch, (12) Jinling Middle Road Branch, (13) Jinling East Road Branch, (16) Xujiahui Branch, (17) North Railway Station Post Office, (10) (8) Sinan Road Branch, (19) Tilanqiao Branch, (20) Xujiahui Branch, (21) South Railway Station Road Branch, (23) Jing'an Temple Branch, (25) Jianguo East Road Branch, (27) Changning Road Branch, (30) Wusong Road Branch.</p>
<p>Mobile Post Office</p>
<p>Since the post office resumed operations, according to Wang, there are a total of 28 new facilities that have been completed and are under planning for the improvement of business operations. The main ones are: (1) simplifying the procedures for registered and express mail, requiring only a date stamp on the receipt when receiving mail. (2) Commonly establishing urban agency offices and postage stamp sales offices. Currently, 22 agency offices and 277 postage stamp sales offices have been added in Shanghai's urban area. Post office branches are also being planned to be added. One branch has been opened at the South Railway Station Branch, and another branch will be added to the telecommunications bureau at the corner of Fuzhou Road on Sichuan Middle Road soon. (3) Adding postal kiosks. First, to facilitate passengers traveling between Beijing and Shanghai, a postal kiosk has been set up in the North Railway Station Hall, and agreement has been reached with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to add a postal kiosk at the Jinliyuan Wharf. (4) Adding mobile post office vehicles. Due to the vast area of the city, in order to facilitate the delivery of mail by various communities and residents far from the city center, a mobile post office vehicle will be launched in the near future. It will travel on a fixed route every day, stopping at each station to sell stamps and receive all kinds of mail, issue small money orders, etc. In addition, ordinary mailboxes and special mailboxes will be added to facilitate rapid delivery.</p>
<p>In terms of postal transportation, in addition to setting up a mobile post office on the Beijing-Shanghai train, it is also hoped that the public can make more use of unified airmail to send mail to distant places.</p>
<p>Selling Small Mailboxes</p>
<p>In addition, due to the dense population of Shanghai, the post office believes that mail carriers waste a lot of time asking for information and waiting for households to deliver letters. In order to improve delivery and save manpower, the post office has specially made a small mailbox for public use. In addition, it is promoting the "holding mail at the post office" method. Anyone who has just arrived in Shanghai and has no fixed address can notify the sender to send the mail to the Shanghai ○○ Post Office for "holding mail at the post office," and they can pick it up at the post office when the time comes.</p>
<p>Philatelic Services</p>
<p>New businesses include insured registered mail, express parcels, and check savings. At the same time, it has also resumed the businesses of value-declared mail, collecting payment for mail, subscribing to publications, and overseas remittances. In addition, it also handles the collection of taxes, plans to purchase stamps and seals by telephone, and establishes a philatelic group to serve philatelic enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Symphony Orchestra is Actively Rectifying Internally, Employing Famous Chinese Players to Participate in Regular Public Performances, Dai Cuilun Denies Dissolution</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, there have been rumors that the Municipal Symphony Orchestra is about to disband. The reporter went to visit Dai Cuilun, the current director of the orchestra, about this matter. Dai expressed surprise at this rumor. According to Dai, the orchestra has a long history and is the largest symphony orchestra in the Far East. Mayor Wu and people in the music industry are happy to support it in order to promote music and social education. He accepted Mayor Wu's entrustment to temporarily manage the orchestra in addition to his busy school affairs at the Conservatory of Music for this reason. Dai also said that he took office last month and is actively rectifying the internal affairs and selecting members. Apart from the fact that a part of the orchestra's Italian members could not be retained due to the evacuation of Italian expatriates, other foreign members will be rehired on a selective basis, and famous national players will be hired to participate. They will officially start work and be paid from tomorrow, but due to the budget stipulated by the Municipal Government, the salary is temporarily set at 44 to 60 yuan. In the future, the income from the orchestra's performances will be used as the orchestra's fund, with Mayor Wu's permission, to enrich equipment and improve the welfare of the members. As for the unfinished matters of the orchestra in the past, the Municipal Government has ordered the orchestra's former director, Xu, to be responsible for handling them.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the orchestra's public performance originally scheduled for the Music Festival on April 5 has been changed to April 13 due to insufficient preparation. The location will be announced temporarily, and the first rehearsal is scheduled for April 5.</p>

<h3>Large Batch of Police Dogs Nears Training Completion; Using Special Sense of Smell to Detect Drug Dealers and Traitors</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate drugs and prevent petty criminal activity, the city's police authorities previously trained a number of police dogs to utilize their special sense of smell to detect drug dealers and petty criminal traces, compensating for the limitations of human manpower. However, the number of these police dogs was small, creating a shortage for distribution. Therefore, from over ninety wolfhounds received from the Japanese military, they selected twenty-five and established a police dog school in Yangshupu, this city, to provide police training. It is reported that experts are responsible for this training, which takes place twice daily, morning and afternoon. Training items include detection, tracking, obstacle crossing, and finding hidden objects. The daily life of these police dogs is also quite comfortable, with food including beef, rice, and snacks of milk and biscuits. According to a teacher at the school, these wolfhounds are exceptionally fierce and can bravely accomplish their tasks without fear of the threat of firearms. Females are easier to tame than males, but their endurance is not as long-lasting as that of males. Training began nearly five months ago and will be completed in a few weeks. At that time, they will be distributed to various branches throughout the city for service.</p>

Fortunately, after the Huangpu Police Branch received the report, it immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to surround and arrest the lookouts Yuan Rong and Zhang Zaihu. The remaining three robbers eventually escaped by climbing over the roof. Subsequently, accomplices Chen A'da and others were apprehended at the Continental Hotel and a certain brothel. However, the ringleader Xu Leming remained at large. After several months of searching, he was finally apprehended. On the afternoon of the previous day, around 3:00 PM, Zhang Renyou, director of the Huangpu Branch, received a tip that a notorious robber, Xu Leming, was having coffee at the Mingxing Coffee Shop at No. 511 Zhongzheng East Road. He ordered section chief Li Yinmin and officer Yang Jihang to surround the location, and the suspect was successfully captured and taken to the station for interrogation. He confessed his name as Xu Leming, nicknamed "Jin Laoye," a native of Nantong, 32 years old, and admitted to conspiring with others to rob the Xinsheng Cotton Mill with weapons, an attempt that was unsuccessful, and also acknowledged committing numerous previous robberies. The police branch applied for his detention. After thorough interrogation, he was transferred to the garrison command for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Blue Funnel's New Giant Ship Makes Maiden Voyage from England to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Blue Funnel Line of the Swire Shipping Company, operating on the Sino-British route, has a considerable history in China. The original fleet consisted of over thirty ships, but most were destroyed by the enemy after being requisitioned for service during the war. After the victory, the company resumed operations in Shanghai and, in order to develop transportation services on the Sino-European route, specially built eleven giant ships. One of them, named "Calchas" (the name of a previously destroyed old ship), has already been completed. It has a gross tonnage of 8,298 tons, can carry 9,000 tons of cargo, and is equipped with refrigeration facilities and oil tanks. Its speed is 15.5 knots per hour. To facilitate travel between Europe and Asia, it has been specially equipped with the latest style of passenger cabins, accommodating twelve people.

<h3>Ministry of Social Affairs to Launch Social Insurance; Director of Factory Inspection Department Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss</h3>
<p>Bao Huaguo, Director of the Central Factory Inspection Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, recently arrived in Shanghai. According to him: "The Ministry of Social Affairs, recognizing the importance of social insurance, has recently established a preparatory office for the Central Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Minister Gu will serve concurrently as the chairman of the committee. The subjects currently planned include worker welfare insurance, injury insurance, public and private school personnel insurance, and health insurance. Currently, various insurance drafts are being actively drafted by various specialized committees. After approval by the Executive Yuan, they can be widely implemented. At that time, social insurance sub-bureaus will be established throughout the country to take charge of the matter." According to Bao, according to the resolution of the last International Labor Conference, the work of child labor and youth labor in various countries should be restricted to protect their health. However, at present, there is a bad phenomenon of widespread child labor in various parts of our country. The Ministry of Social Affairs has successively sent inspectors to various places for investigation since the autumn of last year. Taking Wuxi alone, there are more than 2,000 child laborers. The Ministry of Social Affairs plans to conduct investigations in various regions, including the Yangtze River, North China, and South China, separately, so as to present the statistics obtained to the government and issue birth certificates when necessary to prevent workers from falsely reporting their age and other sophistry. Otherwise, strict restrictions should also be imposed on child laborers who have not reached the legal age to work in factories, based on regulations on weight and height.</p>
<h3>Taking Family to Qingpu, Violent Thugs Force Way Onto Vehicle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhang Weixing, a 35-year-old from Hubei residing at No. 15, Garden Lane, Scott Road, took his family to Qingpu for an outing on March 29th, the Youth Day holiday. On the way back in the afternoon, as the car reached the midpoint, a person in military uniform and one in Chinese attire attempted to board the vehicle, but were refused by the driver. Unexpectedly, the person in Chinese attire forcibly climbed onto the leaf spring, brandishing a pistol to threaten the driver to drive on. Zhang asked them which unit they were from, but they remained silent. Taking advantage of their inattention, Zhang seized the weapon and pushed them off the car, urging the driver to press the engine and drive forward quickly. After being pushed off, the person stood on the roadside, staring blankly as the car drove away. Zhang found that the gun he seized was a Mauser pistol, number 349, containing ten bullets and one magazine. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhang handed it over to the North Railway Station Police Branch and reported the incident truthfully.</p>

<h3>Guo Jiyi Primary School Denies Private Demolition of Air Raid Shelter</h3>
<p>Regarding the news in the newspaper on the 25th of this month about Guo Jiyi Voluntary Primary School demolishing and selling air raid shelters, the school authorities stated that this was not entirely factual. They claimed that the school was established in August of last year, due to the large number of out-of-school children in the area and the children of rehabilitated teachers. They created this school to relieve financial difficulties and provide simple education. Limited by the small room, the children in the school could only take turns in classes. Later, after hearing that the Fudan University campus was planning to demolish the air raid shelters left by the enemy in the sports field, they wrote to ask for the donation of the materials to build the school building. In addition to filing with the Xincheng Police Branch and the District Office in the area, they also proposed it to the District People's Congress, which approved it. Furthermore, the house was purely made of brick and mud, without a large amount of wood. As for Zhang Zhongxian, he was only one of the representatives, and the bricks obtained were still in Fudan University, Jialing Village, and the open space in front of the school, which could be easily investigated on the ground.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>The news you published on the 29th of this month regarding the seizure of a secret radio station is completely inconsistent with the facts. Our radio station is in contact with various ships to maintain navigation safety and facilitate business communication, and it has long been reported to the Ministry of Communications. Many shipping companies with more ships have permanent stations, which are similar to our situation. The Ministry of Communications has approved No. 6976 of the Special Radio Station between our office and Sanbei Transportation Company and Minsheng Industrial Company. All procedures are being handled. Since several radio stations have neither received commercial calls nor charged a single penny, the sections mentioned in your newspaper are obviously rumors and untrue. This is to inform you accordingly, and please correct it. Sincerely, the Joint Office of Dada Shipping Company and Datong Shipping Company. March 29, 36th year.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>The center of a shallow Siberian anticyclone is in the Northeast provinces, Korea, extending to East China, southern Japan, and the East China Sea, in contact with tropical air currents in the Northwest, Central China, Southwest, etc. of our country.

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(1) Withdrawal of Deposits</p>
<p>Huang Shiqi asks: Before the Anti-Japanese War, I deposited funds in banks and post offices. The bank was a fixed deposit with regular installments, and the post office was a current deposit. Later, due to the war, the deposits were stopped. Now, ten years later, I plan to withdraw these deposits, but the value of the currency today is very different from the past. I don't know which ratio to use for withdrawal. Please advise.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] There are no special laws to rely on regarding your questions. You can refer to the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Affairs after Rehabilitation, and let the court decide.</p>
<p>(2) Successive Leases</p>
<p>Wang Yun asks: In the 26th year of the Republic, I leased a piece of land from someone named Jia for a term of ten years, which will expire at the end of October of this year. However, during the war, my father sublet the land to someone named Yi, mistakenly setting the lease term to the end of October of next year. Rent has already been collected in advance. Now Jia insists on taking back the land at the end of October of this year, while Yi insists that it must be returned by October of next year. May I ask: (1) Am I criminally liable for this incident? (2) How should I deal with it if Jia and Yi both demand huge compensation from me?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] (1) It is a civil matter and not criminally liable. (2) The amount of compensation is based on actual damages suffered.</p>

<h3>Suzhou and Hangzhou Scenic Spots Spring Outing Group Travel Frequent; Travel Agencies and Groups Are Busy; Groups of Tourists Are Crowded</h3>
<p>[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] The tail of winter was intercepted in the last anti-Siberian cyclone of the day before yesterday. The willows next door have innocently added tender buds, dancing in the wind, attracting people living in the city to go to open places, to contact a resolution of green and fresh nature, to stretch their curved backs, and to breathe the breath that exists in the countryside.</p>
<p>The season of green and freshness has arrived. It is time for people to return to nature and relive a childhood dream.</p>
<p>In the past few days, the business of the two railway bureaus has begun to pick up again. Tourists visiting Suzhou and Hangzhou are swallowed up in the black carriages in groups, interspersed with people walking single-handedly. People waiting to buy tickets are as crowded as during the Lunar New Year. The business of photographic materials stores has suddenly become prosperous. The photography department of Watson's Pharmacy on Welcome Nanjing Road was also visited by thieves in one resolution, and nineteen cameras worth ten million yuan were found stolen overnight.</p>
<p>The previous weekend, the two railway bureaus invited reporters from various newspapers to visit Hangzhou, which was the first sound of this year's group "spring outing." Several famous travel agencies and tour groups in Shanghai are also busy serving tourists and their members. The China Travel Service has a wide range of businesses and has a special tour group that specializes in group travel. The company's travel magazine is the only Chinese travel publication sold worldwide. It collects and details all the famous scenic spots and historical sites in the country and even around the world. The second is an amateur-oriented Yousheng Travel Group, which has a history of thirty years and now has more than 13,000 members. Before the war, it also published the "Yousheng Monthly" and various special publications. There are also two travel agencies, Pacific and Economic, and two tour groups, Pingzong and Amateur. In addition to traveling, they all have auxiliary achievements in promoting social education.</p>
<p>The difference between a travel "agency" and a travel "group" lies in the fact that the latter has fixed members, does not accept commissions from non-members, and specializes in handling travel business for members. To clarify the travel situation of each family for readers, the reporter made a general visit to them. They almost all have a certain tour schedule every week. This weekend is all inconsistent with going to Suzhou and Hangzhou. Each resolution has a limit on the number of people, and if the limit is exceeded, another organization can be formed. The cost depends on the distance of the tour and the local living expenses. For example, going to Hangzhou for three days, the most expensive is the Pingzong Travel Group, which requires 280,000 yuan, and the Yousheng Travel Group only needs 150,000 yuan. The China Travel Service is 270,000 yuan, the Economic Travel Agency is 250,000 yuan, the Pacific Travel Agency is 245,000 yuan, and the Amateur Travel Group is 175,000 yuan, all of which provide round-trip fixed train preparations. Depending on the difference in cost, it is possible that the enjoyment aspects are also graded, such as cruise ships, cars, early lunch and dinner, hotel tea, etc. According to the person in charge of Yousheng Travel Agency, it is often a loss to serve the members.</p>
<p>In addition, the Hangzhou travel organized by the Youth Center will depart on the 4th of next month. The stipulated quota of 100 people has long been fully registered. Participants only pay 65,000 yuan, including all round-trip expenses. If the result of the trial run can break even, the museum will continue to hold it for the next few weekends until people are bored.</p>
<p>The Writers' Hangzhou Sightseeing Group will also depart at the beginning of next month. April 1 and 2 are the spring holidays for various schools, and there are countless private and group travel organizations. It's just that due to the limitations of vehicles, the two railway bureaus cannot supply as much as before the war. It is now extremely difficult to be able to supply travel agencies with a special train, and discounts are out of the question!</p>

<h3>Dedication to This Year's Normal Education Movement Week The Basic Cultivation of the Education Career</h3>
<p>--- Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>One-One Inspiring Teachers' Love</p>
<p>The education career is the most noble spiritual career. Those engaged in the education career must have a pure and profound love in order to enlighten the wisdom of children or youth and mold the personality of children or youth. A teacher who can truly influence the hearts of students and make education have a positive effect must use the most ardent love to nourish the souls of students.</p>
<p>Our ancient sages once said, "It is easy to find a teacher of scriptures, but difficult to find a teacher of people." Indeed, if we want to find a teacher who specializes in imparting knowledge and skills, it is relatively easy, but it is very difficult to ask for a teacher who can truly give students personality training and emotional guidance. Because the former is mostly external and passive; while the latter is internalized and spontaneous. The former can at most enable students to increase their knowledge and skills; while the latter can enable students to have emotional exchanges with teachers through internal insights, thus changing their entire behavior.</p>
<p>According to the advanced educational principles, the biggest purpose of education is to seek changes in the behavior of the educated. The so-called behavior should include all the thoughts, habits, emotions, attitudes, etc. of students. Traditional education has been deeply influenced by intellectualism, thinking that education only needs to read and listen to lectures, but in fact it has discarded the main purpose of education. The erroneous concepts of "literacy is education" and "reading is education" dominate the minds of ordinary people, causing most people in society to misunderstand education. In fact, the value of education must be demonstrated through the hearts of the educated to achieve the practical application of behavior. Therefore, knowledge, emotion, and will become the three elements in the education process, and emotion is especially indispensable for acquiring knowledge and exercising will. Modern educators believe that all learning should first stimulate motivation and interest. But to stimulate motivation and interest, we must create a strong emotional effect on the learners' hearts toward the learning objects---teachers, teaching materials, and all teaching situations, so that they are willing to accept them. From this situation, we can see how great the impact of the teacher's attitude on students' learning is.</p>
<p>However, most teachers ignore this point, which has led to the tendency of education to become "commercialized." Schools have become places to sell knowledge, and teachers' teaching seems to be selling knowledge to students. Students enter schools as if they are buying knowledge from teachers. There is no emotion between teachers and students, and teachers don't even need to ask about changes in students' behavior. Of course, this situation cannot be generalized. We can sometimes see enlightened teachers who use passionate love to warm the hearts of children or youth, and achieve the practical effect of personality influence. However, there don't seem to be many who can do this, otherwise wouldn't the effect of education be greatly enhanced?</p>
<p>The old academy system in our country is very admirable in some situations. Because it can pay attention to the emotional connection between teachers and students, it emphasizes character-building. Looking at the private schools of the past, from the point of view that teachers and students have more opportunities for contact, they are not without merit. The teacher's stern face sometimes makes students fearful, but the relationship between the teacher and the student, and the teacher and the student's parents, is almost impossible to regain in today's schools. The different educational organizations of today and the past are a major reason for this, and the teacher's failure to exert the emotional power of military education is another major reason.</p>
<p>I remember Kexinsterler once said: "The essence of the teacher's spirit is pure love for children. Those who cannot love children cannot be educators at all." This can also be applied to educating young people. Young people and toddlers are endowed with innate intimacy, and their frank and innocent nature surpasses that of middle-aged and elderly people. Rather than teaching him with strict authority, it is better to move him with sincerity. Education is not coercion, but guidance; it is not injection, but enlightenment. If teachers can use more encouragement and encouragement to guide students in all learning, the effect will be very great. When teachers gain the trust of students, they don't have to worry about them not accepting the teacher's guidance. When they accept the teacher's guidance, they don't have to worry about him not being inspired by the teacher in terms of thoughts, habits, emotions, and attitudes, and affecting the development of his entire personality.</p>
<p>In recent years, the education authorities in our country have paid great attention to improving the guidance methods of schools at all levels, such as implementing the "counselor system" and advocating the common life of teachers and students, which are all important plans. We hope that teachers can show ardent love, not advocating that education should be completely free and laissez-faire, and not emphasizing discipline. On the contrary, we very much hope that those engaged in the education career can work hard for education with a serious attitude, but the love we require is definitely not doting, but pure love, compassion, and love accompanied by reason. Confucius' educational spirit of being strict in appearance but gentle in approach should still be emulated by today's teachers.</p>

The two sides lined up, and after the Soviet team presented flowers, they immediately attacked. Laobvsitv and Abiguf advanced together, but were blocked by Yiliang.

<p>End of First Half</p>
<p>Qingbai Leads by One Goal</p>
<p>The Soviet team, having lost the first goal, launched a large-scale attack. Nuogaoluofu crossed from the left corner, but Little Huang Mao was offside first.

The Soviet team took advantage of the Qingbai's empty defense and launched a fierce attack. Fortunately, Yan Shixin and Meng Yiliang responded properly and defended the position, and soon the first half ended. Qingbai then led by 1-0.</p>
<p>A Cold Arrow Hitting the Mark</p>
<p>The Soviet Team Equaled the Score</p>
<p>After the break, the two armies fought again. Qingbai's five forwards advanced, but Qiuting lost contact and had no place to use his strength. Yichen's laziness was aroused, and Songyi was slow to move. The center-back line assisted the defense, but the front line was out of reach. The entire team was divided into two parts. The Soviet team was determined to take revenge and had a strong attack. Kaji Siding, single-handedly explored the camp, but fortunately Bigao was alert and was not taken advantage of. Not long after, Little Huang Mao tried again outside the boat code, and the ball was urgent and turned into a corner kick. Nuogaoluofu opened it, just right, and Sha Luoning fired a cold arrow from the crowd and hit the mark, 1-1 The Soviet team leveled the score.</p>
<p>Free Kick</p>
<p>Little Luo Laid the Foundation for Victory</p>
<p>The foreign army succeeded and became even more rampant. In front of Qingbai's goal, enemy cavalry was rampant. At 34 minutes, the lazy cow's nature broke out and injured Tingling Guf, and Bolang entered to replace him. Qingbai changed generals, replacing Li Songjun with Fei Chunhua, and then got a turning point. Qiuting was active, and the Soviet team was in a hurry. At 42 minutes, Sha Luoning committed a handball foul by mistake, and Little Sanzi took the penalty outside the 18-yard line. A small pass in the middle, Luo Shoufu shot into the net, 2-1 Qingbai looked up again. Yu Bei borrowed one, Kaluolielu asked, Guan Ren's forward, Si Guren replaced the defender, and Nuogaoluofu retired with a foot injury, but before long, the statutory time had expired, and Qingbai eliminated the Soviet Union 2-1 and won the final spot.</p>

<p>Consolidating Creditworthiness and Sound Organization</p>
<p>Chen also summarized the main points of the organizational regulations of the Fund Supervisory Committee as follows: He said that in order to consolidate creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has strived to make the organization of the committee sound. For example, the regulations clearly stipulate that the committee "shall independently exercise its powers within the scope of supervision. Before the principal and interest of the treasury bonds are fully paid off, its supervisory authority shall not be changed." "It may make suggestions to the Ministry of Finance at any time regarding matters related to consolidating government creditworthiness and safeguarding the rights and interests of bondholders." Furthermore, regarding state-owned enterprises and enemy/puppet properties guaranteed by the Treasury Bond Fund, it "may hire experts to conduct independent investigations and may supervise the sale of these enterprises and properties, as well as their operation before the sale." Also, "the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and other relevant competent authorities shall, in accordance with the regulations, allocate the funds of the Treasury Bonds to the Fund Supervisory Committee for safekeeping and supervision on time in advance." Before each redemption of principal and interest expires, the committee should "allocate the amount payable from the fund to the managing bank for payment and announce it in the newspaper." In addition, the committee is jointly organized by representatives of relevant agencies and leaders of financial, industrial, and commercial communities. The purpose of each provision is to strengthen the organization and authority of the committee and to seek openness in its operations, which is sufficient to demonstrate the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Simplified Procedures and No Fees</p>
<p>Regarding whether the collection of funds for solicitation and sales in various regions will be handled exclusively by the National Bank, Chen said that the National Bank, entrusted with handling the solicitation and sales, may hire local people in various regions at home and abroad to organize solicitation and sales committees, and may designate several local banks and money shops to collect bond payments. The procedures for solicitation, sales, collection, and invoicing will be simplified as much as possible. Purchasers will not be charged any handling fees for paying the purchase price. The banks and money shops that collect bond payments should store the collected funds in a special account without interest. In addition to reporting the amount of revenue on the same day every day, they should settle accounts every ten days and remit them to the local National Bank, which will immediately transfer them to the head office for inclusion in the treasury account, and then the head office will report to the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>
<p>Matters Handled by the Solicitation and Sales Committee</p>
<p>The Solicitation and Sales Committees in various regions will handle the following matters: (1) Promotion and publicity of solicitation and sales. (2) Agreement of solicitation and sales groups and banks. (3) Simplification of solicitation and sales procedures and prevention of malpractices. (4) Allocation of solicitation and sales amounts and oversubscriptions. (5) Suggestions regarding the consolidation of the creditworthiness of these treasury bonds. The committee will have eleven to seventeen members. In addition to the local National Bank representative as an ex officio member, the remaining members will be appointed from representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Money Industry Association, and other leaders from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Chen that the government's efforts to seek national creditworthiness were welcomed by the people, but whether preparations were being made to reorganize pre-war public debts. He replied: This question is not the task of my trip to Shanghai, so I will not say much. In short, the various measures taken by the government to issue treasury bonds are sufficient to prove that the authorities have made up their minds to start anew with the people and make the greatest efforts to design and restore creditworthiness as much as possible.</p>
<p>[Another report] Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, returned to Nanjing by evening train last night.</p>
<p>Financial Leaders Express Opinions</p>
<p>Opinions on the government's issuance of bonds: (1) Qin Runqing, a veteran of the money industry, said briefly: The government's resolute issuance of US dollar bonds to maintain the value of the currency and guide floating capital in the market is in line with the people's psychology and can be called a wise move. What I hope from the government is that this income should be used to stabilize finance and alleviate the people's difficulties. Also, the custody of the fund should be extended to public groups to strengthen public confidence. (2) Luo Jihua, Executive Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said that the government's first announcement of the regulations for the issuance of US dollar bonds at the beginning of the implementation of the economic reform plan can be said to meet the needs of the times. The bonds are all denominated in US dollars, and there is no fear of currency devaluation. Prices and finance will be more stable, and the economic trend will gradually turn optimistic from this turning point.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops in the City to Resume Business Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Will Petition for More Flexible Exchange Rate Allocation</p>
<p>The city's silver shops, which have been closed for a long time, are scheduled to resume business completely tomorrow (1st). According to the person in charge of the industry, they will continue to petition the Ministry of Finance and the competent authorities of the city to request the following two points: (1) The Central Bank should allocate silver to the silver shops at the official price within the possible scope to maintain their business; (2) They request the Ministry of Finance to handle the exchange rate more flexibly to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants.</p>
<h3>Domestic Cigarettes Improve Quality; Sales of American Cigarettes Greatly Decrease; Most Imported Foreign Cigarettes are Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>According to people in the cigarette industry: Since the victory, foreign cigarettes were first imported with the US and British armies stationed in China and distributed to various cigarette stalls on the streets. Under the principle of affordable prices and good quality, smokers all bought and smoked them, and they became popular, causing the glory of domestic cigarettes to be suppressed, and sales suffered as a result. At that time, the most popular foreign cigarettes on the market were the American-made "Camel, Chesterfield, Marlboro, and Lucky Strike" and other brands. British cigarettes were second because of their high price. Later, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the prices of imported cigarettes rose significantly. In addition, the "Three Cannon Towers, Qianmen, and Dananwei" cigarettes produced by Yizhong Tobacco Company and the improvement of the quality of domestic cigarettes competed with them, and the sales of foreign cigarettes finally declined. Since the government implemented import controls this year, the import of cigarettes has been strictly restricted. Currently, most of the packaged and canned foreign cigarettes sold on the market are smuggled from Hong Kong and transported to Shanghai from South China. However, the sales of American cigarettes are not as prosperous as in the past.</p>
<h3>Gold Purchased by the National Bank to be Temporarily Stored in the National Treasury</h3>
<p>The Central Bank, after adopting the policy of selling gold, purchased a large amount of gold from the United States to meet market needs. A ship from the United States arrived in Shanghai earlier this month from San Francisco, carrying a large amount of 26,000 catties (13 tons) of gold, which was recorded in this newspaper yesterday. It is rumored that this large amount of gold was ordered from the United States by former Prime Minister Song Ziwen for the Central Bank to use for sales, but it has only arrived in this port now, and the sales policy has been abolished. The shipping company is currently discussing delivery procedures with the Central Bank, but this batch of gold has lost the need for use, so it will be temporarily stored in the national treasury.</p>
<h3>Mayor Plans to Request Instructions from the Central Government to Reduce the Negotiated Price of Flour</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is learned that Mayor Wu believes that the current price of flour in the city seems to be too high. The ratio of flour price to rice price in the past averaged three and a half bags of flour to one dan of rice. However, according to the current prices of flour and rice, only two bags of flour are needed to equal one dan of rice. Therefore, he summoned the persons in charge of various flour mills to discuss ways to reduce the negotiated price. The manufacturers said that there are various difficulties in accumulating and that the supply of raw materials is not smooth, so please do not reduce the negotiated price for the time being. It is heard that Mayor Wu is planning to request instructions from the central government on the matter of reducing the negotiated price of flour in order to decide whether to reduce it or not.</p>
<p>[Another report] 10,000 tons of foreign wheat arrived here from the United States a week ago and have been unloaded by the Ministry of Food and will be allocated later.</p>
<h3>National Bank Discount and Loan Committee Officially Established Today</h3>
<p>Establish Industrial Export Loan Review Committee</p>
<p>Central Bank President Zhang Jia feels the need for the business of state-owned banks and decided to organize a Discount and Loan Committee, which will be officially established today. It is reported that the main tasks of the committee are to establish contact with commercial banks to assist in production and export business. It will set up an Industrial Loan and Export Material Loan Review Committee to handle the review of applications for rediscount, pledge, and re-pledge of exchange by commercial banks.</p>
<h3>Egg Exports to the UK to Resume Soon</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from the Central News Agency in Washington, D.C. on the 29th] According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, China is about to resume egg export trade. It is heard that according to the draft agreement, the Central Trust Bureau will financially assist the purchase, packaging, and refrigeration of eggs mainly exported to the UK. The USDA report also pointed out that the previous egg exports were valued at US$12 million annually, and said that the plan is subject to the approval of the Chinese government, as it involves foreign exchange rates and the profits and losses of the Central Trust Bureau. At the same time, it also needs to be discussed with the British Ministry of Food. The USDA report also said that under normal circumstances, most of the world's rapeseed production comes from China, and the export volume is extremely large. China's rapeseed production from 1946 to 1947 is estimated at about 4 million tons.</p>
<h3>Wool Textile Industry Requests Relaxation of Raw Material Quota; Chairman Cheng to Present to the Import Control Committee Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The wool textile industry is facing a serious problem because the quota for wool raw materials is too small, and factories are successively stopping or reducing production. Yang Liren, Secretary of the association, has been rushing to produce more than a dozen types of statistical tables and will present them to Li, the Director of the Quota Allocation Department of the Import Control Committee, through Chairman Cheng, requesting a relaxation of the quota to avoid shutdowns. The national wool textile factory startup and employee statistics table is attached below:</p>

<h3>Private Factories Temporarily Suspend Oil Supply Due to Uncertainty of Raw Material Supply; There is Talk of Adjusting the Negotiated Price of Edible Oil Again</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] For the distribution of edible oil in the city, state-run oil factories continue to supply 700 dan per day through the China Vegetable Oil Factory without interruption. The distribution of 1,600 dan of edible oil from private oil factories contracted by the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office for the fourth cycle was completed on the 24th and has not been continued.</p>
<p>According to people in the industry, although private oil factories still have considerable reserves, they can only temporarily suspend oil supply due to the uncertainty of raw material supply. It is reported that the raw materials needed by state-run and private oil factories were once contacted with the Central Trust Bureau, and the bureau will first supply 4,000 tons of soybeans, distributing 3,000 tons to the China Vegetable Oil Factory and 1,000 tons to the private oil factories at a price of 60,000 yuan per dan. It is said that the plan has been approved by former Prime Minister Song Ziwen. It is currently heard that oil factories are sending representatives to discuss the matter with Mayor Wu, intending to request that the soybeans be quickly allocated to facilitate the continued extraction of oil to maintain people's food. It is also heard that the Edible Oil Price Review Committee will convene a meeting in the coming days, and the negotiated price of edible oil may be adjusted again.</p>
<p>Reasons for Rising Oil Prices</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] People in the oil industry analyze the reasons for the recent rise in oil prices, believing that: (1) land prices are expensive, and (2) large quantities of edible oil are exported from the city. It is said that a telegram came from Qingdao yesterday, stating that the price of raw oil in that area is 260,000 yuan per dan, and the transportation cost to Shanghai is 35,000 yuan per dan, so the net price per dan arriving in Shanghai has reached 295,000 yuan. If it is raw oil in a jeep barrel, then a barrel fee of 20,000 yuan per dan must be added. It was also found that 5,000 to 6,000 dan of raw oil were shipped from the city to Hong Kong in March to exchange for imported goods that could not be settled in foreign exchange. The government is paying close attention to this matter and is currently conducting a thorough investigation. In the past few days, foreign firms such as Baolong in the city have loaded and exported 1,000 tons of refined oil and peanut oil to foreign countries.</p>

<h3>The Taipei Incident: After the Storm, Ambitious Individuals Fish in Troubled Waters - A Complete Account</h3>
<p>— Pai Ya</p>
<p>Since Taiwan's return to the motherland on October 25th of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], the initial period was focused on reception and organization. Governor Chen designated the 35th year [1946] as the year of reception. When Japan handed over Taiwan, all factories, mines, and production sectors were at a standstill. It was practically impossible to find a factory still emitting smoke. Therefore, although last year was called the year of reception, efforts were also made to restore the original work. Factories gradually began to emit smoke again, and production sites employed thousands upon thousands of workers. All sectors have made significant progress. Governor Chen, to stabilize Taiwan's finances and social order, and to prevent the island from being affected by domestic and international economic crises, requested that the central government allow Taiwan to continue using the Taiwan currency. He also implemented a monopoly policy to prevent foreign capital erosion and fluctuations in commodity prices. This was for the construction of Taiwan, the livelihood of the people, and to supplement the income of the provincial treasury.</p>
<p>Speaking of the monopoly policy, the main agency is the Monopoly Bureau. Its main monopoly goods are tobacco, alcohol, matches, camphor, etc. It remits 50% of its total monthly revenue to the treasury. To develop its business, the Monopoly Bureau naturally promotes the sale of its monopoly goods. Recently, it was discovered that foreign cigarettes were flooding the market, with small cigarette vendors filling the streets and alleys with smuggled cigarettes. Chinese people have always preferred foreign cigarettes, and Taiwan is no exception. As a result, the Monopoly Bureau's business has been severely affected. In late February, it was reported that a sailboat fully loaded with foreign cigarettes had landed at Tamsui, intending to infiltrate the city. Inspection officers were dispatched to investigate, and while the ship was found, the foreign cigarettes had already been unloaded. The officers then dispersed to investigate various illegal cigarette stalls, hoping to stop the practice.</p>
<p>The Beginning of the Trouble</p>
<p>On the evening of February 27th, at around 7 PM, inspection officers Sheng Tie-fu, Zhong Yan-zhou, Zhao Zi-jian, Liu Chao-qun, Chuan Xue-tong, and Ye De-gen, six in total, took a truck to the most bustling Yanping Road (formerly Taiping-cho) in Taipei City to conduct inspections. Quick-witted peddlers ran away to hide, but one female cigarette vendor, Lin Jiang-mai, was caught because she couldn't escape. The inspection officers, according to the law, naturally confiscated her goods. However, the female cigarette vendor resisted the confiscation, as it involved her entire capital. This led to a dispute between the two sides. A large crowd of people gathered to watch, and among them were some ruffians who were always looking for trouble. They seized the opportunity to join in the commotion and threw stones at the inspection officers. The sound of shouting was incessant, and punches and kicks were thrown in all directions. The few inspection officers were unable to resist and abandoned their vehicle, fleeing in different directions. However, the rioters did not let up and continued to chase after them as a group, determined to catch them. One inspection officer, cornered and desperate, fired a shot in self-defense, unintentionally hitting a person named Chen Wen-xi in the crowd. The bullet pierced his left chest, and he died on the spot. The female cigarette vendor Lin Jiang-mai was also injured. Thereupon, the rioters, together with a general public, went directly to the Military Police Headquarters and the Taipei City Police Department, demanding that the culprit be handed over for public execution to avenge the deceased. They beat gongs and shouted slogans to amplify their demands. Although the military police tried their best to explain, they could not ease the situation. The rioters also pushed the truck seized from the inspection officers to the Ximen Roundabout and set it on fire. This chaotic situation continued throughout the night.</p>
<p>The Onset of the Storm</p>
<p>By 9 AM the next day (the 28th), the crowd again marched through the streets, beating gongs and drums, forcibly ordering businesses to close. Shops throughout the city closed their doors one after another, and there was unrest everywhere, with the people in a state of panic. When a group of people beat gongs and drums to Taiping-cho, Police Chief Huang of a certain police station tried to stop them, but not only did it have no effect, but he was also surrounded and severely beaten. The police station was also destroyed by the rioters. This marked the beginning of the behavior of harming government personnel and destroying government agencies. Soon afterward, over ten thousand people besieged the Monopoly Bureau and the Taipei Branch. People from all directions rushed in like an avalanche, and anyone who was from mainland China was beaten. The matches, cigarettes, alcohol, cars, bicycles, and other public goods and property in the bureau were all carried out onto the road and burned. Even doors, windows and shutters were not spared, with nothing left intact. The flames soared into the sky, and on March 1st, the embers had not completely died out. There were still two or three thousand people watching. Although the military police arrived, they were unable to maintain order.</p>
<p>The Air is Filled with Wronged Souls</p>
<p>When the burning of the Monopoly Bureau began on the afternoon of the 28th, groups of rioters were everywhere in the streets and alleys of the city, searching for people from mainland China to beat, calling them "Ah Shan." Thus, if "Ah Shan" were spotted by them, they could not escape the disaster of being "beaten." Severe cases resulted in death, while minor cases resulted in disability. Even women, children, and pregnant women were not spared. According to what the reporter learned, a child of several years old was walking down the street with his mother when they encountered rioters. The rioters used a knife to cut the mother's mouth to the ear, stripped her clothes off, beat her severely until she was on the verge of death, and threw her into a ditch. The child was violently twisted around so that his face was backwards, and he immediately died. Another child was grabbed by his feet, inverted, and his head slammed into the ground until his head was broken and his brains were flowing. Another person slammed the heads of two children into each other until blood flowed from their brains, and this was treated as something to celebrate. A pregnant woman was stabbed in the abdomen with a Japanese samurai sword, and both lives were lost. Such venomous acts are too numerous to recount. It is shocking that such inhumane events would occur in Taiwan, which is said to have a higher level of culture than any other province in China. Those who heard about it were horrified, let alone those who witnessed it. At that time, all people from mainland China were in danger, fleeing or hiding. It was almost like "the wind howls, the crane cries, every plant and tree is a ruffian." The cries of "beat Ah Shan" echoed through the skies and did not stop. All government agencies closed their doors, and the staff all took flight as the best option. During this period, it can be said that it was a world of ruffians. At about 2 PM on the afternoon of the 28th, another group of one or two thousand people marched towards the Governor-General's Office, attempting to riot. They were stopped by the guards, who fired shots to disperse them. There were some casualties on both sides, but the rioters did not disperse and go home. Instead, the situation became even more complicated, and they went to the North Gate to besiege the Railway Police Department. Many officers of the department were severely beaten and had many rifles stolen. Fortunately, the military police arrived and were able to relieve the siege (because the military police were obeying Governor Chen's orders not to fire without authorization). Subsequently, students stopped attending classes, employees of various agencies and organizations went on strike, shops were closed, and people stayed at home with their doors shut. Everything fell into a state of extreme chaos. In total, the riots on this day spread throughout Taipei City. More than a dozen public and private cars and trucks were destroyed. A large number of people from mainland China and civil servants were beaten, injured, or killed. Tiger Balm Garden and Taipei's only large department store, Shin Tai Company, were both destroyed or looted. (According to preliminary investigations and statistics from the Department of Civil Affairs, in the Taipei area alone, more than 400 public and education personnel were killed or injured, and property losses amounted to 500 million Taiwan dollars, a staggering figure.) Other counties and cities have not yet been included. Most tragically, Zhu Wen-bo, the magistrate of Hsinchu County, was severely beaten by rioters in Taiping-cho while traveling to Taipei in his private car on official business. Fortunately, he escaped. At this time, passengers on trains from the south who were from mainland China were also beaten by ruffians lying in wait at the station when they got off the train. The number of deaths and injuries was also very high. In order to stabilize the order, the Governor-General's Office and the Garrison Command announced martial law in the evening. But at night, the ruffians still moved around in groups with guns and knives. Gunshots were heard frequently, making it impossible to sleep, as if one were on a battlefield.</p>
<p>Government's Response</p>
<p>This incident, which had been brewing since the evening of the 27th, not only did not subside by the evening of the 8th, but actually escalated. Therefore, the Governor-General's Office and the Garrison Headquarters, in addition to announcing martial law, also issued a statement on the handling of the incident. The main points are as follows: (1) Those responsible for causing the trouble during the crackdown on smuggling will be dealt with according to the law, and strict orders will be given to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. (2) A small number of rioters have taken advantage of this incident to engage in actions that endanger public security. The Garrison Headquarters has implemented temporary martial law to protect order. Once the situation has been calmed down, the martial law order will be lifted.</p>
<p>People's Demands</p>
<p>Starting from the morning of March 1st, there was still a chorus of beating sounds, and public enterprises and government employees' dormitories continued to be destroyed. They left no stone unturned, doing their best to "beat" and "destroy." At 10 AM, the Taipei City Council invited National Assembly representatives, provincial senators, councilors, and others to form a committee to deal with the bloody incident of the crackdown on smuggling. The inaugural meeting was held at Zhongshan Hall, presided over by Speaker Zhou Yanshou, who stated: This committee should endeavor to accept the demands of the citizens and convey them to the government in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution to this case. The attendees enthusiastically expressed their opinions, and as a result, it was decided to send representatives Provincial Assembly Speaker Huang Chao-chin, Taipei City Council Speaker Zhou Yanshou, Provincial Senator Wang Tian-deng, and Councilor and Radio Station Director Lin Zhong to meet with Governor Chen at the Governor-General's Office and present five demands: (1) Immediately lift martial law, (2) Release the arrested citizens, (3) Order the military police not to fire, (4) Organize a joint committee of officials and civilians to handle the matter, and (5) Request Governor Chen to broadcast to the public. Governor Chen immediately agreed to the demands. Regarding the first point, he would convene various agencies to discuss the lifting of martial law before 4 PM. Regarding the second point, the release of arrested citizens would be guaranteed by the fathers, elder brothers, neighborhood chiefs of the arrested citizens. The third, fourth, and fifth points were agreed to. As for the citizens who were killed and injured by the smuggling crackdown on the evening of the 27th, the Garrison Headquarters immediately sent a letter to the Taipei City Council stating that the authorities had decided to allocate 200,000 Taiwan dollars for compensation and 50,000 Taiwan dollars for the injured, and requested that it be conveyed to the claimants for collection.

<h3>After the Liberation of Yan'an, Where Did the Communist Army Flee?</h3>
<p>— Jinan, 20th [Day], Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Li Tian</p>
<p>After twelve years of arduous management, Yan'an, regarded as the "nerve center" by the Chinese Communists, was forced to be abandoned after a week of defensive counterattacks by five Nationalist divisions, and fled in panic northward. This not only fully demonstrates the invincible and unconquerable strength of the Nationalist army, but also proves the weak and vulnerable nature of the Communist army. Since March and April, the Chinese Communists have repeatedly emphasized their determination to "defend Greater Yan'an." They did not expect that "Greater Yan'an" would be quietly abandoned within a week. On this point, the Chinese Communists can no longer use the same excuses as in the past, such as abandoning Zhangjiakou, Siping Street, Changchun, and Linyi, to cover up their military failures. "Strategic retreat, annihilate the Nationalist army, preserve strength, and not focus on gains and losses in one point or one line." So, where did the Chinese Communists go after abandoning Yan'an?</p>
<p>Targets of Attack</p>
<p>According to the observations and analyses of several famous military experts, their conclusions are almost identical: the possible targets of attack by the Communist army in the future are: (1) Taiyuan, (2) Changchun, (3) Jinan, (4) Qingdao, and (5) Baoding. Of course, if their military strength allows and there is an opportunity, the Communist army may launch offensives against the above five places or several places simultaneously, but the probability of capturing Taiyuan is the highest.</p>
<p>The Importance of Taiyuan</p>
<p>According to General Chen's recent report, the headquarters of the Communist army may have retreated to northwestern Shanxi. Therefore, the main force of the Communist army in northern Shaanxi today, in addition to using a minimum number of troops to contain and delay the advance of the Nationalist army north from Yan'an, is likely to concentrate in central Shanxi at the fastest speed, and even join forces with Liu Bocheng's Song Renqiong (commander of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region), Chen Geng (commander of the Taihang Military Region), Wang Xinting (commander of the Taiyue Military Region), Nie Rongzhen (commander of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military Region), and Yao Zhe (commander of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Military Region), who have already crossed the Yellow River and fled north, to besiege Taiyuan in central and western Shanxi. Shanxi is rich in resources, unlike the barren north of Shaanxi. The strategic and political importance of Taiyuan is also much greater than that of Yan'an, which is located in a remote corner. If Taiyuan is captured, it can not only regain face after abandoning Yan'an, but also control Shanxi, move east out of Niangziguan, attack Baoding, threaten Peiping and Tianjin, and move north to Datong and Zhangjiakou to restore its corridor to Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it can send out small groups to harass the rear of the Nationalist army in Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, contain the Nationalist army's strength, disrupt rear traffic, and disturb rear order. Then, with its main force, it can prepare to choose a time and place in the Shanxi-Hebei border area that it deems appropriate (just as Zhu De said, when the Communist army's strength has expanded to be balanced with the Nationalist army) to carry out a decisive battle with the Nationalist army. This is the most advantageous move for the Communist army at present, and it is also the wishful thinking that it has always had in mind.</p>
<p>Avoiding Hard Nuts</p>
<p>Changchun is the heart of Northeast China, and its importance is far greater than that of Harbin and Jiatai. The Communist army has launched two spring offensives and suffered setbacks. However, because the Communist army in that area has more convenient and advantageous geographical conditions for receiving supplies and reinforcements than any other area in the country, it is possible that it will launch a third attack. Baoding is the capital of Hebei Province, and it is also possible that the Communist army will attack it. Jinan and Qingdao are currently large strongholds of the Nationalist army in isolated counties. Chen Yi is now concentrating his main force along the Jiaoji Railway, and his intentions are obvious. However, as of the time this reporter is writing this article, the renewed offensive against Jinan has not yet stopped. Qingdao is the location of the US Navy and a place of international concern. Although there is no determination to attack or occupy it, at least if the Communist army occupies Qingdao's water source, it will cause a lot of trouble for the residents there. Other places such as Datong (the Communist army may attack Datong with a part of its force while attacking Taiyuan, in order to prevent Fu Zuoyi's troops from rushing to the rescue), Zhangjiakou, and Guisui may also be attacked. As for Peiping and Tianjin, the Nationalist army's defenses are currently strong, and the Communist army has always avoided hard nuts, so the possibility of them being attacked is the smallest. The above is a view based primarily on the Communist army.</p>
<p>Military Focus</p>
<p>Under the strong counterattack of the Nationalist army, this attempt by the Communist army is precisely the best opportunity for the Nationalist army to annihilate its main force. If we take the Nationalist army as the main focus, then, as Chief of Staff Chen said, "The military focus in the future should be in Shandong." The Nationalist army's northward forces are being divided into three army corps, led by Tang Enbo, Ou Zhen, and Wang Jingjiu, and are advancing simultaneously from Linyi, Yanzhou, and Juye. On the left flank, because it is the plain of southwestern Shandong, the advance is faster. The vanguard has crossed Ningyang Wenshang, crossed the Da Wen River, and advanced north to the outskirts of Tai'an. On the railway front, it has reached the vicinity of Dawenkou. On the right flank, it is also gradually advancing north from Linyi. On one side, it is also carrying out encirclement and suppression operations with the Nationalist army advancing east from Qufu against the more than 10,000 Communist troops entrenched in Sishui and the Phoenix Mountain southeast of Sishui, as well as the two divisions (New Seventh Division, New Tenth Division) in Liangqiu southwest of Feixian. After this area is cleared, the threats to the flanks and rear of the Nationalist army on the right flank and the main front will be eliminated, and they can then calmly advance north. After the left flank of Wang Jingjiu's army corps formally joins forces with Wang Yaowu in Jinan, the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway will be opened, and then the Jiaoji Railway will be opened (at a minimum, the Jinan-Zhangdian Zibo line should be opened first). Then, together with the Tang and Ou army corps, the encirclement of the Yimeng Mountains will be gradually narrowed and annihilated.</p>
<p>A Migratory Existence</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, it can be judged that the Shandong Communists have transported their families and cumbersome supplies north of the Yellow River (but not the military forces). It seems that if the attempt to resist the encirclement and suppression of the Nationalist army fails, some of the Communist forces may retreat to Jiaodong as a last resort. (On the 19th of this month, the water level of the Yellow River at Beiluokou in Jinan rose to 1.02 meters, with a depth of 3.9 meters, a flow rate of 1.14 meters per second, and a surface width of 72.08 meters. The waves are turbulent, and the water volume is continuing to increase. Therefore, if the Jiaoji Railway is reopened by the Nationalist army, it will not be easy for the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains to cross the Yellow River and flee north before winter.) Similarly, the Nationalist army's strongholds in Qihe, Yancheng, and Sangzidian, etc., outside Jinan on the north bank of the Yellow River, may suffer losses at the hands of the Communist army in the short term due to the difficulty of reinforcements. Some of the Communist forces may disguise themselves as ordinary people and go into hiding among the people, becoming underground forces that attack the Nationalist army. Most of them will probably make use of their light and rapid equipment to break up into smaller units, break through the encirclement at any time, and relive their so-called 25,000-mile Long March of migratory existence. On the surface, they are carrying the golden signboard of Marxist-Leninist communism, but in essence, they are just like Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, going wherever they can, killing wherever they go, living wherever they stay, and eating wherever they can.</p>

<h3>Recent Trends in American Literature: The Rise of the Novella</h3>
<p>— Li Dongfang</p>
<p>Early last September, on the deck of the General Meigs, my old classmate Mr. Wu Zuxiang and I talked for about an hour about the novella. He is a leading expert on novellas in China. This conversation was arranged with him beforehand specifically to discuss the novella, nothing else, and without the knowledge or participation of any third party. – Very mysterious.</p>
<p>Because of my lack of foundational knowledge, I was completely ignorant. Even though he tried his best to make me understand, I still regret not having received a full explanation. What exactly is a novella? How should it be written or appreciated?</p>
<p>After arriving in the United States, many short stories pleased me, but many also displeased me. Long novels are relatively easy to find satisfying, but many also made me close the book and sigh, frankly because the content was not good. – I seem to be concluding that all novellas are good.</p>
<p>This statement is, of course, somewhat of an exaggeration. However, it is a fact that more novellas are good than bad, while more short and long novels are bad than good.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because the length is just right, making it easier for editors to appreciate and select them, so the ones that get chosen for publication are unlikely to be that bad. Readers unknowingly support good writers for the same reason.</p>
<p>Modern life is too busy to allow spending seven or eight hours, or two lots of seven or eight hours, to finish a long novel (around 300 pages). Modern life is also too complex, making seamlessly simple themes seem childish and shallow.</p>
<p>This is another reason for the popularity of the novella.</p>
<p>The novella, of course, falls between the short story and the long novel in terms of length. If someone believes that the novella emphasizes differences in content and nature, and can be shorter than the 5,000-word standard for short stories or longer than the 300-page (75,000-word) standard for long novels, they are, of course, free to express their opinion. However, I am not sure if they are intentionally trying to be different and superior or if they are misleading young people. In terms of nature, the novella also falls between the two, possessing the strengths of both. It focuses on a specific point, like a short story, but it tells the story in a leisurely and unhurried manner, similar to a long novel. It can hold the reader's attention from beginning to end, but it is not too simple or childish because, in addition to a central theme, it can also include several secondary plots that can both enhance the story and make it more realistic.</p>
<p>For this reason, it is popular in America today.</p>
<p>The more important magazines each have one novella per issue. These magazines, of course, also have several short stories. But I dare say that short stories can be good or bad, while novellas cannot afford to be bad: editors dare not choose a bad one. Take the Red Book (which doesn't discuss red politics), which sells over two million copies a month, for example. The same goes for its sister publication, Blue Book (specifically for men, while Red Book is enjoyed by both men and women). As for the Saturday Evening Post, which can be bought in major cities across China, the same is true. Many people buy it every week just to read the novella in it. Collier's, American, Cosmopolitan, Lady's Home Companion, Fortune, and so on, all do the same.</p>
<p>An American novella writer of note, Ms. Helen Hull, like Mr. Wu Zuxiang, is reluctant to give the novella a definitive definition. She said, "The story I wrote, 'Snow in Summer,' I initially wanted to write as a short story, about a man who suddenly becomes famous and doesn't know what to do. How new hopes cannot adapt to the old environment is what I wanted to write about. Later, I thought it would be better to make the protagonist a woman, and it would be best if she became famous for writing a book, rather than winning an award like the man I originally wanted to write about. It would be best if this woman was also a housewife with many children and a husband with a strong sense of career and self-respect, such as a dentist. How would her husband react when she suddenly received a notification from the bookstore that her book had been selected as the recipient of a publishing prize? I also wanted to write about her as a housewife living in a small town, so how would the neighbors and people in the street gossip about this and be jealous of her? Then she would have to leave, leave the small town, even leave her unhappy husband (because his annual income is not as much as this prize). And after she leaves, another young lady would sympathize with this innocent dentist – this becomes a novella.</p>
<p>But Helen Hull is kind, so when this novel was written, the heroine did not break up with her husband. The husband surrendered out of admiration. Therefore, there was no need to add a sympathetic third party who took advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>I categorize Helen Hull's view under the heading of "Knowing is Difficult, Doing is Easy." People who act often "act according to what their heart finds peace in," knowing what is, but not knowing why. (This statement does not include my old friend.)</p>
<p>I especially love reading Peter Paul O'Mara's "Let Yesterday Go!" Yesterday is Anne Darford's gray memories of living with her father, and her yellow memories of later being with a scientist. The affectionate Dr. Lenott both help her to let yesterday become yesterday.</p>
<p>Her father, Huntley, lived with her without servants, and did not let her read because they were too poor. Her father did not socialize with anyone and was very frugal. The father and daughter were so poor that they could only eat vegetarian food. Anne even hid in the kitchen to eat bread with cold water, not even daring to eat the vegetarian food, saving it for her sick and bad-tempered father.</p>
<p>After her father died, only a few people attended the funeral, including Dr. Lenott and lawyer Spale. When the lawyer visited her that evening, Miss Anne knew that he was coming to talk about her father's debts and ask her to move out of the house, etc. Who knew that Spale the lawyer would tell her that her father was very rich, with several houses in addition to $200,000 in cash, and that the entire will was for her. – This made Anne hate her dead father.</p>
<p>Dr. Lenott advised her to go to New York to study and work, to pursue a bright tomorrow. After a few months of depression, she got used to it and was very happy. Dr. Lenott shouldn't have taken the train to visit specifically to raise $20,000 for a scientist. She was very unhappy. But afterward, she allocated the money anyway. Lenott still returned to his small town to practice medicine.</p>
<p>The scientist himself came to New York, and in addition to thanking her, he hoped to get a little more. She did not promise to give more money, but after repeated entanglement, she allowed him to kiss her. He was such a rude, simple, and selfish person, why could she be so compliant? Why did she abandon Dr. Lenott completely?</p>
<p>Mr. O'Mara, who wrote the novel, doesn't blame her at all. Dr. Lenott doesn't blame her either. She had wasted her childhood and half of her youth, and she was already twenty-seven years old this year! We can only feel slightly unfair.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the scientist was excessively rude, liked to drink, and even fought with the waiter in the restaurant, which suddenly made her decide to dump him and become very close to Dr. Lenott, who happened to have arrived in New York. The second yesterday also went to its place.</p>
<p>The novella is interesting precisely because its flavor is sometimes strong and sometimes weak.</p>

<h3>Love</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Cun</p>
<p>"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith." - Solomon</p>
<p>From ancient and simple, or desolate and lonely mountain villages, from foggy or smoky cities, from distant or nearby different areas: you send these letters with the same affectionate feelings, making me feel a pleasant burning, making me have the pain after the burning.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, I tear open your letter envelopes, wiping away tears, letting your black, blue, red... one by one, star-like words, jump into my eyes. Under the dim light, I stop breathing, wringing out the crystallization of your emotions, I read, laughing; I read, crying…</p>
<p>Your love! Like warm holy water, flowing through my heart, frozen in December, and in the furnace of my emotions, with your love, it is like having burning coal; it shoots out brilliant sparks, the sharp flames illuminating my ordinary life.</p>
<p>– I have been so moved by the love of your sincere conscience that I have had several sleepless nights!</p>
<p>Some say that they live for friendship, and I too, with your kind love, have the determination and perseverance to step into the thicket of thorns. On the road where suffering grows like weeds, I have never stopped or looked back, regretting the traces of blood I left behind on the road I have traveled. Nor have I ever felt troubled or tired by this arduous and long journey.</p>
<p>Just as days without the sun make me curse, I cannot live a day without love. I came into this world for love and to be loved. If the people around me are all emotionally numb, iron-like beings whom I cannot love or be loved by, then I will be like a fish without water: suffocating to death, suffocating to death!</p>
<p>I don't know if love can be selfish? I seem to be like someone who embezzles for money; I greedily absorb people's love. I would rather be like a broken ship, letting the raging waves smash and sink in the overflowing sea of love; I would rather be like a moth drawn to a flame, dying on the sparks of love or being burned to death in the boiling oil of love.</p>
<p>Those who know how to love and how to be loved also know how to live. Those who love everyone and are loved by everyone are exceptionally happy. They live in days with sunshine and flowers, without any unnecessary worries or troubles. No matter how great the suffering, they can overcome it. No matter how great the blow, they have the courage to resist it. The more calamities come, the more they sing. The deeper they hate, the deeper they love... How is their life tempting me!</p>
<p>And I, who am overflowing with emotions, have the same heat and integrity. I don't want any of you to unreasonably abandon me. That is more cruel than a mother abandoning her dead child, more cruel than a man abandoning his wife, more cruel than making me fall into extreme hunger, more unbearable.</p>
<p>A child living in love and hate said: "If others don't love me, I would rather die than live... To receive sincere love from the people I truly love is to let a bull trample me and break my arm; or stand behind a kicking horse and let its hoof kick my chest, I am willing to endure..." How much this child values ​​the love of others! Her words are a cry for love, and also my cry!</p>
<p>Today, I want to tell you with tears that I live for your love. If you are stingy with your emotions, if you… then you are intentionally raising your hand to kill your brother, then you have an unforgivable guilt in your conscience.</p>
<p>My hand, extended here: those who love me, those who are loved by me, come! I want you to hold it tightly! Hold it tightly.</p>

<h3>Jessie's Letter</h3>
<p>— Feng Li</p>
<p>I know Wei, and I know Jessie. I also know and understand Wei and Jessie's love. They are both very frank with me and have never hidden or concealed anything.</p>
<p>Jessie was still a senior at FT University when Wei was a senior when Jessie was a freshman. After Wei left school, Jessie often wrote to him.</p>
<p>Wei is the oldest of Jessie's boyfriends. Jessie has never loved a younger boy. She hates women who fall in love with younger men. She feels that kind of love is cruel and should be cursed. Anyone who has read "La Dame aux Camélias" will sympathize with Marguerite, but Jessie is the exception. She does not want to sympathize with her. Unfortunately, this time their school performed "La Dame aux Camélias" and Jessie was assigned to play Marguerite. When Jessie discovered that the actor playing Armand was a freshman named Lu Bo, she felt very disappointed. But as a result, she loved Lu Bo, and gradually forgot about Wei.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favorite letters from Jessie among the many letters that Wei recently showed me. One of them is for Lu Bo, and one is for Director Lu. According to Wei's speculation, Jessie was probably too busy with rehearsals, and in a hurry, she mistakenly put the letters to other people into the envelopes for him. Although he is very forgiving of Jessie, I understand a young girl's feelings even more. Coincidentally, the editor of this magazine asked for a manuscript, and for a while there was nothing to submit, so I obtained Wei's consent and copied and sent it to fulfill my obligation. I think Jessie, who has always been known for being frank and generous, wouldn't object, right?</p>
<p>Because I dare not take credit for others' work, I hereby explain the situation above.</p>
<p>(1) Dear Wei:</p>
<p>I have good news to tell you, our school is putting on a play. Mr. Lu selected "La Dame aux Camélias" and assigned me to play Marguerite. Mr. Lu is so great, he let me play such a good role.</p>
<p>I am often tired of my ordinary life. I want to escape this life and find the life in books, and also want to taste the life of an artist.</p>
<p>I am so excited, I seem to have a lot to say, but I can't find a word that can write out what I want to say.</p>
<p>Wishing you sweet dreams!</p>
<p>—Jessie</p>
<p>(2) My Dear Wei:</p>
<p>Our play is already in rehearsal. I discovered that the male actor playing Armand is a Freshman, his name is Lu Bo, he is a very handsome and cute young man, I like him, but I don't like him playing my lover Armand, because he is too young, he is even younger than my brother! How can I play a romance with him!</p>
<p>—Your Jessie</p>
<p>(3) Dear Bo:</p>
<p>Thank you for the new ideas that are as bright as sunshine that you have given me. They have rekindled my old feelings. May you always keep your newness.</p>
<p>—Your Honest Jessie</p>
<p>(4) Dear Teacher:</p>
<p>I don't know how artists live their lives. They perform two shows every day. How can they enjoy their own lives in the little time they have left!</p>
<p>I hate theater life, it destroys my friendship of love. Now I have understood the love between Marguerite and Armand. Rehearsing one show a day is enough to make me forget myself. I have forgotten that I am Jessie.</p>

<h3>Ibsen's Debut Work</h3>
<p>— Fu Bo</p>
<p>When Ibsen was twenty years old, he was still working as an apprentice in a drugstore in Grimstad. The spread of European revolutionary thought ignited his young heart, so he stole time under the candlelight at night to engage in revolutionary creation. His debut work, "Catiline" (Katilina), is a three-act tragic poem.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-two, he published it at his own expense, selling only thirty copies. He used the pen name "Brynjólf Bjarme".</p>
<h3>Short Maxims</h3>

<h3>Picture of Peaceful Mountains and Rivers in a Long Day</h3>
<p>— Ying Yeping</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 209</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Very good, you really should rest for a while."</p>
<p>"But you'll have to bother to tell that maid to wake me up at half past nine."</p>
<p>"Sleep for another half hour, I'll come at ten o'clock, we still have to discuss the formal program." She had another idea.</p>
<p>Tsurumi didn't really sleep. After breakfast with Pingzi, he returned to his room, closed the door, lay on the large soft couch behind the window, constantly smoking cigarettes, with that note still in his hand.</p>
<p>"0915!"</p>
<p>The words "Hua Mao Hotel" were simple. You only need to ask someone to know what location and what kind of place it is. Only this number is very peculiar. He believed it was definitely not a room number. How could a hotel have such a large number? No, maybe it's room 915 on the first floor? Maybe this hotel has so many rooms? Impossible. Or is it room 15 on the ninth floor? What does this "0" mean? And why is the action so mysterious?</p>
<p>In such a large Wansui Hall, there are only two telephones, and they are both in the manager's room. Tsurumi didn't want to disturb anyone, let alone let people know about such a thing.</p>
<p>"0915," Tsurumi read the number backwards. New place, new people! Everything is so displeasing. He also thought of the boy who threw the paper ball: his face was so dark, his clothes were so tattered, but his teeth were so neat and white; and his actions were quiet, calm, agile, and natural. Speaking, throwing the paper ball, saluting, turning around and slipping away, each step and action was in order, and of course, planned.</p>
<p>"Why didn't I get out of the car to chase him?... Why didn't the car attendant notice? True, he was busy moving the suitcases, his brain was simple, his perception was dull, and he was focused on service. After placing the suitcases, he had to hurry to drive the car. He couldn't do two things at once, right?..."</p>
<p>"But why didn't I get out of the car to chase him at the time?" Tsurumi questioned himself; the more he thought about it, the more confused he became. After being confused for a while, he tried his best to recall the scene when he got into the car; recalling, fiercely recalling. After guessing for a long time, he finally got a few answers.</p>
<p>He believed that his actions were correct: he did not have a violent reaction to the boy's actions. First, he wanted to maintain a calm attitude and not be surprised by strange things; had he experienced fewer strange things in the Northeast and in Japan? Why make a fuss over a trifle? He believed that the first reason for not getting out of the car to chase the boy was due to the calmness that had been cultivated through past experience, which prevented his hasty reaction.</p>
<p>This point is also plausible. Then are there other reasons? Maybe because he was too tired? Originally, he hadn't had a good rest in a week. In Tokyo, in that tense environment, whether awake or asleep, his nerves absolutely couldn't rest. Returning to the Northeast, returning to Peiping, constant setbacks, constant new problems, one after another, troubles and confusions grew in his heart like weeds. In addition, there was also the warmth of his comrades, endless stories, endless reports. Even in sleep, his nerves were excited. He was not a steel robot, after tension, stimulation, distress, and excitement, there was also a long journey of about ten hours. No one would believe that he was not tired. He was really tired, so naturally all reactions were slow.</p>
<p>The reason for being tired also seems plausible, but it still cannot completely convince himself.</p>
<p>"That's right!" He thought of another reason: He remembered that Pingzi asked him "What is this thing?" His view was "Probably no malice." Perhaps it was this view that stopped his usual violent reaction?</p>
<p>However, why did he have this view at the time? Although he was taken aback, wasn't Pingzi also greatly surprised? Pingzi didn't advocate interrogating the boy, naturally because of his attitude and answer, which was as cold as ice. However, what is the reason why he was unmoved when he saw a cooperative woman being frightened? Yes, maybe he was afraid that a violent action would result in Pingzi being even more frightened. For example, if that young fellow pulled out a gun and shot twice, or even threw a small bomb, and it exploded with a loud bang, wouldn't things be worse? Wouldn't Pingzi be even more panicked?</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Random Chat by Du Bo</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>One summer, a child was sweating profusely from the heat. The "smart" mother dragged the child to the courtyard to bask in the sun, supposedly to dry the sweat on his clothes.</p>
<p>This clever idea may have been successful at times, but unfortunately, this child was not blessed. Before his clothes could be dried, he lay on the ground dying. The mother waved her fan, walked out, and sighed:</p>
<p>"This child is really lazy, how did he fall asleep?"</p>
<p>If the above makes you laugh, it may be a joke.</p>
<p>A joke becomes a joke because the person telling the joke doesn't laugh himself.</p>
<p>Some people haven't even started telling a joke, and they start laughing a lot themselves. In this way, others may also laugh, but what's funny is not the joke, but that inexplicable silly laugh.</p>
<p>Mr. Ludwig, a contemporary commentator and biographer, has a few valuable words, he said:</p>
<p>"If two people are watching an opera, one sitting in the first row of a box and the other sitting in the gallery, their impressions of the same opera will be as different as the impressions of the same era between a contemporary observer and a historical researcher. Both have their advantages. The person below can listen to the actor's voice undisturbed, hear his breathing, and see his characteristic performances, thus knowing more about the hero in the play than others; but the other person can see the whole play unfold on the stage."</p>
<p>This is a very valuable passage. When we observe everything, whether it is current politics or other aspects, we must always keep two seats. One below, one in the gallery, and often switch seats to watch in the same scene.</p>
<p>In Vienna, on March 14, 1827, at the end of Beethoven's letter to Moscheles, Romain Rolland wrote a footnote after checking the documents:</p>
<p>"Beethoven was almost penniless at this time. He wrote to the London Philharmonic Society and Moscheles, who was in England at the time, asking them to organize a concert for him to raise money. The London Philharmonic Society generously sent him one hundred pounds immediately as an advance, and Beethoven was deeply moved. According to a friend, when he received this letter, he clasped his hands together and burst into tears of joy and gratitude. Everyone present was heartbroken and moved. The old wound burst open again, but he still wanted to read the letter and have someone write a letter to thank the generous Englishmen for sharing his tragic fate. He promised them to compose a large piece of music; the Tenth Symphony, an overture, and whatever they specified. He said: "I will write those pieces of music with a love in my heart that I have never had before." This reply letter was written on March 18, and he died on the 26th of the same month." (Fully based on the translation by Chuan Lei)</p>
<p>This great and always reserved musical saint; the darkness of the human world, the inner loneliness is knowable. He finally accepted the generosity of others. For a mere one hundred pounds, he would burst into tears of joy and gratitude. This just shows that this human world is too devoid of warmth; even a slight echo makes the sensitive poet unknowingly excited.</p>
<h3>Concerning Material Allotment</h3>
<p>— Ding Ren</p>
<p>It is a universally acknowledged fact that the lives of general public educators are difficult. For many years, they have endured hardship and stood at their respective posts, shouldering the heavy responsibility of supporting the country. Their contributions cannot be considered small. However, their meager income is often less than that of a rickshaw puller, which cannot help but make one feel sorry for them.</p>
<p>After the victory, everyone received salaries according to the cost-of-living index. However, public educators were still paid based on a government-determined multiple of a base number. For example, with a base salary of eighty yuan, the multiple was only around three thousand. How could this compete with the skyrocketing prices? Although there was a provision for adjustment every three months, the adjusted salary often lagged behind the price increases. Although the government recently implemented measures to allocate materials, we feel that the assistance to general public educators is still not practical enough, especially for low-level civil servants. Instead, it has become a burden. Taking today's (26th) published allocation of goods as an example, items such as rice, oil, salt, sugar, coal briquettes, and cloth—if you want to buy them all, then one month's income is definitely not enough to cover these "materials." If I were a civil servant in this situation, I would have to swallow my tears.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a step back and discuss the matter objectively. In addition to the possibility that the allocation of materials may lead to the neglect of the three-month salary adjustment, we cannot help but offer some opinions regarding the potential abuses that may arise from the allocation itself:</p>
<p>First, the establishment of special agencies for the allocation of materials adds a large amount of overhead. Whether this is a reasonable plan, we cannot say.</p>
<p>Second, the allocation has increased the number of people in businesses outside the three hundred and sixty traditional trades—those who buy allocation tickets. As a result, civil servants are distracted from their work and spend their days calculating ticket prices and listening to market news. We can already predict these phenomena today. The impact on administrative efficiency cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Third, it is possible that in the future, there will be instances of inflated reporting and deductions at lower levels during the distribution of allocation tickets.</p>
<p>Fourth, the quality of the materials may cause a lot of trouble for everyone.</p>
<p>On the eve of the upcoming allocation, we offer these humble opinions for the authorities to seriously consider and carefully handle. It will probably not be without benefit.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes Under the Lamp</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>Before 1939, a total of thirty-three countries in the world had women's suffrage. Fourteen more countries have been added since then, and now women in forty-seven countries have the right to vote. However, women in eighteen countries, including Argentina, Belgium, and Switzerland, still do not have the right to vote. There is an ancient saying in our country: "A short separation is better than a new marriage." The Swedish government seems to agree with this, as it recently passed a law stipulating that every married woman is entitled to ten days of vacation each year. If her husband cannot be by her side during these ten days, the government can provide all the expenses for her vacation.</p>
<p>There is a radio station in Mexico City called XEOK. This station is the only commercial radio station in the world that does not have any programming. It announces the time once every minute, twenty-four hours a day. However, in addition to the few seconds of time announcement, the radio station still has a wide variety of commercials every minute. Because each advertisement takes a very short time and has many variations, the business is still booming.</p>
<p>Horses also often get seasick. Many fine steeds need to rest for five or six months after a sea voyage before they can gallop again. Recently, some horse racing enthusiasts in the United States specially sent a plane to Ireland to transport six excellent breeds to Los Angeles. This is the first time that horses have flown across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The biggest payout in the history of horse racing occurred on October 30, 1935, at Newmarket in England. A spectator bought a double-win ticket for six dimes and won a prize of $11,650! (Translated from Collier's magazine, etc.)</p>
<h3>An Anecdote of the Great Era: Animals Cannot Escape the Disaster</h3>
<p>— Ya Mu</p>
<p>The Taipei incident has now passed like a storm.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that many compatriots have suffered and been frightened. What no one expected was that even the animals, large and small, in the homes of people from other provinces, as well as the livestock in the zoo, were not cared for or fed because their owners or managers were fleeing. At the same time, they could not run away, so they had to endure many days of hunger, thus experiencing the most serious threat of death.</p>
<p>If these animals had consciousness, sensitivity, and could speak, I wonder what they would say.</p>
<p>This is truly a small anecdote of the great era! In short, it is inevitable that chickens and dogs will be restless in a storm. If animals had knowledge, they would inevitably feel that it is difficult to be an animal.</p>
<h3>Neon Lights Shine</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>In the past, due to power conservation, except for the four large characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" on the roof of the International Hotel, all other outdoor neon lights were not allowed to shine.</p>
<p>From April 1st, because the power supply is relatively abundant, outdoor neon lights can also be opened.</p>
<p>Without outdoor neon lights, walking on the street at night is gloomy, dark, and desolate. It feels like the market is so bleak and so desolate.</p>
<p>Now outdoor neon lights can shine brightly again, but does this mean that the market has prospered again?</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"Umbrellas of Cherbourg"</h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>None of the films produced by "Zhongda Hua" are above average. Regardless of the script, performance, or technology, this "Umbrellas of Cherbourg" is another sloppy and inferior film.</p>
<p>The screenwriter, Shi Lin, simply wrote this story inexplicably. The emptiness and childishness of the content make people laugh and cry. The main characters in the play, He Ping and the old judge, etc., all have inexplicable contradictions, especially the old judge. The development of the plot is even more childishly laughable. The police's pursuit of the fugitive is completely hide-and-seek. Plane tickets can be bought casually in the countryside. He Ping catches the murderous robber and then releases him. The judge's niece falls in love with the fugitive at first sight... Examples such as these are simply absurd to the point of disbelief. Such a story, detached from reality, was rarely seen in civilization plays even ten years ago.</p>
<p>The performance is also a series of clumsy comic strips, coupled with the incompetence of the director, Zheng Xiaoqiu. He simply does not understand film techniques, let alone the use of directing methods. He only desperately grabs some low-level gimmicks to stuff to the audience, resulting in the entire film progressing like a clumsy and verbose old woman telling a smelly and disgusting story.</p>
<p>The editing, photography, and recording are bad to the point of being unwatchable. All the actors speak Cantonese Mandarin, and 60% of the dialogue is unintelligible. After watching this film, it is impossible to believe that it is a brand new film.</p>
<p>Because the script and director determine the fate of the actors, Li Qing, Rong Xiaoyi, and Rong Yuyi, who had better achievements in the past, are all gone in "Umbrellas of Cherbourg." What is left is only the clumsiest acting.</p>
<h3>Integrity, Prudence, Diligence</h3>
<p>— Chen Dexing</p>
<p>The Elementary Education says: "The way to be an official, there are only three words, namely, integrity, prudence, and diligence. Knowing these three, then you know how to maintain yourself!" Someone explains: "Integrity is incorruptibility, prudence is adherence to etiquette, and diligence is loyalty to duty." Please see how many officials today possess all three qualities? I hope the government's performance evaluation uses these three words as the standard; and I further hope that officials at all levels constantly examine and restrain themselves with these three words!</p>
<h3>Justice Resides in People's Hearts</h3>

<p>The sinking of the Fubo warship is just a wave in the recent tide of large-scale accidents at sea, land, and air. It's nothing strange. What distinguishes it from other accidents is that the Fubo was a gift from Britain and has not yet been properly used. Now that I think about it, we are really ashamed to have received it. British Navy official, Bowyer Todd, even sent a telegram of condolences, further increasing our shame.</p>
<p>However, the most lamentable is the hundred and several dozen officers and soldiers, especially those young trainees. They gave up their studies and joined the navy, but now their ambitions have not been fulfilled, and they are buried at the bottom of the sea. It is too unfair. The ancients said, "Death can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai." What kind of death is theirs?</p>
<p>Now is the time to investigate responsibility. In terms of navigation technology, the captain of the _____ steamer claims that he made no mistakes. He strictly followed the navigation route. Although he clearly saw the other party entering his own lane, he could continue sailing forward because he had not made any mistakes. The responsibility for the accident did not lie with him. This reminds me of an incident where a cat somehow crawled under a tram on the road and was trapped between the crisscrossing iron bars, unable to escape. If the tram started, the cat would definitely die. After it died, the driver would of course not be responsible. However, the driver and the ticket seller, disregarding their duty to arrive on time and ignoring their undoubtedly great right to drive forward, spent a lot of time, and two or three people got greasy and dirty, finally dragging the damn cat out, watching it jump and bound home, and then, amid the joy of the passengers and passersby, they started the tram. Comparing these two, it is really far off to wonder what the value of workers not understanding rights and obligations is.</p>
<p>In addition to technical issues, there is also the issue of rescue. This is the point that the families of the victims intend to accuse the Hai Min steamship of. It is said that the passengers on the Hai Min ship expressed indignation and spoke out against injustice for the dead. However, in the conversations of some passengers, we cannot see anything. This makes us confused. Does justice reside in "people's hearts" but cannot appear in "people's mouths"?</p>
<h3>French film star, Sifrre, was famous in the art world before the war. He was captured by the Germans during the war, and it was repeatedly rumored that he was no longer alive. It was not until the end of the war that it was known that the rumors were false. Today, Mr. Sifrre has gone to New York to perform a four-week dance performance. The picture shows Mr. Sifrre talking with Hollywood stars Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer before his performance at the Miller Theater.</h3>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At this time, countless fantasies had densely covered Lan's meninges, completely reaching a state of being unable to see or hear. She hated Feifei's rashness in sneaking out alone at night to find the coppersmith whom she absolutely could not find. At the same time, she deeply loved the innocence and loveliness of the seven-year-old girl, who dared to venture out at night in such an unfamiliar place to repair a toy. She worried that she would be abducted by bad people, and she worried that she would lose her life in the bombing and strafing of enemy planes. She also felt sorry for Zhu Zhaonian, her lover whom she had loved eleven years ago. She feared that he had been bombed to death with Feifei; or that Feifei had returned unharmed, but old Zhu had been too eager to run around searching and had not taken shelter in the air-raid shelter, resulting in an accident. She also blamed herself for staying in Guilin to wait for the arrival of a slim hope of a remittance, resulting in such an unfortunate event, and also meeting old Zhu, who had long been rumored to have died.</p>
<p>Although her marriage to Hu Juewen was not entirely based on love, their relationship had been very good for ten years. Juewen had also been extremely loyal to her, and his tireless spirit of immersing himself in research all year round made her admire him from the bottom of her heart. And the clever Feifei and Xiao Rong also added a lot of harmonious and pleasant air to the family. After this separation of three years, Lan could not deny that she missed Juewen somewhat, even though this bookworm was still so poor and so inept at planning for his wife and children.</p>
<p>In the anxious and fearful waiting, Lan had also blamed Juewen's muddleheadedness. If he could have waited for them in Guilin for two more months, how good things would have been! Feifei would not have been lost! Zhu Zhaonian would not have been encountered.</p>
<p>In her confusion and bewilderment, she suddenly noticed that the people around her were all standing up, and Xiao Rong's hand was also pushing her hard.</p>
<p>"It's over! The air-raid alarm has been lifted!" Only then did she hear people shouting clearly.</p>
<p>People surged out like a tide, and Xu Pangzi was also urging Ah Shi to leave quickly.</p>
<p>"Go back and quickly call the train station!" He was anxiously thinking about his wooden furniture.</p>
<p>"It's all right! Mrs. Hu, we'll guarantee that we'll see your little sister as soon as we get back!" Xiao Shen comforted Lan with great consideration, while reaching out to tuck in Rong'er, helping them, mother and son, squeeze out of the crowd.</p>
<p>This time, Rong'er did not resist him, only kept shouting, "Go out and find my sister! Go out and find my sister!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Shen." Compared to Xu Pangzi, who was a relative, Xiao Shen was of course a warm-hearted person, so Lan thanked him all the way.</p>
<p>"It's all right, we're all family!" Xiao Shen said very proudly.</p>
<p>As they approached the entrance of the cave, Jin Aili, who had been separated from them for half a day, suddenly seemed very excited and jumped over, shouting:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hu! Mrs. Hu!" (30)</p>
