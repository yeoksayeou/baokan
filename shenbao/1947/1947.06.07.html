<h3>美總統將發表聲明　重申經濟援華政策　馬卿主張提早貸款我國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：合眾社特派員漢士萊特：杜魯門總統在最近數星期內，將重申對華政策，內容與開放對華借雲消霧散事有關。同時，馬歇爾亦主張提早貸款與中國。該特派員之華盛頓電訊原文如次：據消息靈通方面告此間合眾社稱：「蔣主席「擴大」政府工作，已有若干成就，因此，在開放進出口銀行五億元借款方面，已掃其障礙。杜魯門總統有鑒於斯，極可能在數星期內重申對華政策，聞馬歇爾國務卿對於此事極爲贊同。馬卿認爲及早援助中國國民政府，實爲得策。此外，馬卿並深信：本年已無機會爲中國自國會獲得大量之援助。按進出口銀行所已派定借與中國之數額，並不需要國會通過，但其有效期爲六月三十日。」</p>
<p>又據悉：官方人士於近數日來，接獲中國東北外交人員之報道謂，共產軍在該處作戰力量，業已大見增强，故對於中國情勢之關切，一般均因此加甚。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山六日廣播：美官方宣稱，在美方未重申對華政策前，中國暫不向美方提出關於使用進出口銀行五億元借款之計劃。據該銀行官員稱，中國現仍未提出用款之計劃，蓋正在等候杜魯門總統之重申政策也。按在過去兩週中，中國已將計劃準備就緒，但在美方政策宣言未發表前，暫不提交。據悉：杜魯門總統將對進出口銀行使用壓力，促其延長借款有效期，並對中國計劃一事，採取寬和政策。關於借款事，馬歇爾與進出口銀行之見解，顯有衝突，馬氏係眾廣泛國際政治方面觀察此事，深信必須提早對華給予經濟及心理上之援助，但進出口銀行之觀點則反是。彼等之觀點。乃狹小之商業觀點，杜魯門總統現正以軍事援助阿根廷一事，測騐民眾反應，此種反應如屬良好，則其援助國民政府之計劃，必可順利實施也。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦五日電〕英遠東問題專家葛林本日表示：中國目前雖屬驚濤駭浪，然將來仍極有希望，葛氏係於六月號政治雜誌半月刊上，發表長篇文字，其對中國當前諸問題，均作極精闢之分析。葛氏並列舉我國光明而具有希望之因素，並請英人在對中國局勢判斷與估價時，當憶及中國曾經十四年戰禍，其災難較任何國家爲甚。葛氏繼稱：中國且可寄厚望於蔣主席之領導，顯然已能配合時代之需要，廿年前嚴厲之軍人，今日已成爲眼光遠大之政治家，其目標之不容置喙爭辯，一如其威望之崇高，在蔣主席支持下，具有啓迪性之新與論，業已建立，中國仍須面臨驚險之道路，以及甚多使人沮喪之事物，惟其終點，實爲一片光明。</p>
<h3>美軍事顧問團　助我建立新軍　魯克斯少將報告詳情</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京六日電〕魯克斯少將今日招待記者，首次透露美國駐華軍事顧問團之任務，包括協助國防部及軍事學校之改組，設立軍事訓練學校四處，並擬具長期計劃以提高中國軍隊之效能及敎育不準等。魯克斯少將力言，自美軍顧問團於一年前設立以來，從未對參加中國戰爭之軍隊予以援助或發生任何關係僅從事協助建立訓練及改革計劃之初步準備。此一計劃須十至十五年始能完成，其成功猶有賴於內戰之結束。根據軍事顧問團所擬之遠期計劃，中國各部之人士，均應服兵役，在正式入伍之前，須受軍事及茲本敎育之訓練，使受訓者得以了解中國之情形及憲法常識。美軍顧問團，爲協助進行此項計劃起見，派駐中國之官兵計共七百五十名，此外尚有美國海軍顧問團約三百人。魯克斯少將復謂美國軍事顧問團曾協助國防部之改組。此外改組後之軍事學校已大成都成立，其制度約略模仿美國之西點陸軍大學。美國軍事顧問團並協助組織參謀學校及國防大學一所。此外另有訓練敎官之學校四所成立，南京區並有步兵學校一所。美軍顧問團將儘可能早日訓練中國之軍隊，惟在內戰期間，此項工作尚無法展開。計劃擬先訓練步兵一師，然後以之爲核心，訓練其他軍隊。至於空軍訓練學校，已在成都·杭州·漢口·上海等地設分校。此外在南京有砲兵學校，在徐州有裝甲部隊學校，最近已有學生一百二十名自裝甲部隊學校畢業。</p>
<h3>不授以戰鬥訓練　免捲入內爭漩渦</h3>
<p>另據合眾社訊，在成都訓練之計劃中，另加若干課程，大部分爲訓練空軍士官而用者，因此該項士官畢業後，除授予軍職以外，尚授予以學士學位。目前之計劃，須立即訓練一步兵師，作爲中國可有與他國同等現代軍隊大規模計劃之一部分。惟渠指出，顧問團現不允許授以戰鬥訓練，因美國不願捲入中國之內戰也。目前之計劃排除與作戰有關之訓練。陸上部隊之訓練，與實際之軍事作戰無關，他方面空軍顧問分團之人員，亦不准參加實際作戰，而衹担任技術員及敎官之訓練，以及器材與設備之保養敎練。在過去一年中顧問團曾將若干學校移至戰鬥區甚遠之後方，同時，馬歇爾亦命令在北平之空軍訓練團移往他處，以免使人攻擊美人參加或幫助中國政府打內戰。</p>
<h3>莫德惠請病假　主席覆電照准</h3>
<p>〔中央社訊〕府委莫德惠氏，自台返滬後，臥病中山醫院，時已一週，迄未見痊，日來血壓且又升，體溫亦增，勢需繼續住院療養。莫氏因特電呈蔣主席請假一個月，昨已接獲主席覆電照准，並致慰念。該電稱：「中山醫院莫委員柳忱先生，函電均悉，途迂風濤，致妨健康，良爲馳念，尚希安心靜養，期早康復爲幸，中正已江府支印。」又悉：莫氏夫人暨愛女在平獲悉莫氏患病消息後，已兼程趕來上海探視，三日後抵達。</p>
<h3>交部籌備恢復　中美直接通話</h3>
<p>京滬將先開入營業</p>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕交部與美國電話電報公司治商恢復中美直達無綫電話，現將籌備就緒，我國各地與美國各地通話價目，均屬一律，且較戰前價目爲低，美國各地發至我國各地電話通話三分兼或不滿三分鍾收美金十二元，星期日優待用戶，槪以七五折收美金九元，超過三分鍾之通話，每一分鍾或不滿一分鍾加收美金四元，星期日加收美金三元。我國各地發往美國各地電話，根據上項美金價目，按美金一元與國幣一萬二千元法定折合率折合國幣收取。京滬二地將先行開放營業。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕國府委會六日上午九時舉行第四次國務會議，蔣主席親自主持，會討國民參政會提出之和平方案，並通過工業會法立法原則等案。會議開始時，首由外長王世杰，參謀總長陳　分別報告最近外交，軍事，繼由文官處報告：（一）憲法說明書起草委會組織規程案，（二）本年六月一日承認匈牙利政府案，（三）東北各省及東北各院轄市臨參會組織大綱案。關於國參會本屆大會通過之和平方案，該會秘書處經於五日下午送達國府委會，六日國務會議中列入議程，提出討論，首由文官處宣讀該項和平方案全文，王世杰·鈕永建委員等組織發言，僉認和平爲今日政府與人民一致之要求，但應研究如何促其實現。蔣主席繼重申和平解決國是爲政府一貫方針，盼各委員詳加研討，提出具體實施辦法。最後決定對參政會此項和平方案，由各委員再作會外商討，提付下次會議決定。旋討論提案，通過各要案如次：（一）工業會法立法原則案。（二）監委楊永浚已改任政務委員，遺缺以陳翰珍遞補案。（三）輪船運價，自六月份起酌予調整案。（四）經濟部·交通部·資源委會主管各事業機關暨京·滬兩市公用事業·卅六年度五·六月份貼補經費追加預算案。（五）追加敎育機關及學校卅六年度經當費案。（六）國防部主管卅六年度科季服裝追加預算案。（七）卅六年度軍糧價款暨糧食費追加預算案。（八）黃河修防工程經費及黃河堵口復堤追加工程費，卅六年度歲出預算兩案。（九）各機關卅五年度追加收支轉作卅六年度收支預算十三案。（十）行政·司法·監察等院所屬機關，追加卅六年度房屋租賃費及日僑給養費預算七案。（十一）行政·司法·監察等院所屬各機關，追加追減卅六年度收支預算九案。（十二）參政會卅六年度大會臨時費追加預算案。（十三）河北等十四省市卅六年度歲入·歲出總預算案。（十四）各機關追加卅六年及卅五年度經臨事業等費，動支卅六年度第二預算金四十三案。（十五）各機關動支卅六年度善後救濟基金五案。（十六）故國府委員樂景濤遺族救濟費一千萬元案。按六日出席國務會議委員爲張羣·居正·鄒魯·翁文灝·王憲惠·章嘉·邵力子·王世杰·蔣夢麟·鈕永建·吳忠信·陳布雷·常乃惠·余家菊·胡海門·戰　翹·陳輝德·王雲五等十八人。</p>
<h3>公私輪船業運價　准予自行議定　政府貼補本月起停撥</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕輪船業運價，經六日國務會議通過，准自六月份起酌予調整。此項辦法包括民營及國營輪業，過去政府對該業之貼補亦自同月起不再撥給。今後運價均由該業自行議定。此案係行政院長張羣提出，其理由爲：目前運價係去年十二月核定，本年三月起實行貼補，但以物價激漲，目前貼補之數不足虧損之什一，民營部份業經全國物價委會決議，准予自行議價，故國營部份亦當同樣辦理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕全國經濟委會所屬五小組，本週內將分別開會，就軍費，對政金融·糧食·國營事業之出售及一般預算等問題，詳加研討，俾向下星期一舉行之該委會第三次大會提出。又經委會六日午後舉行審查會，審查辦事規程。</p>

<p>薛部長之開幕詞略稱：此後對全國水利，應如何積極推進，端賴內外聯緊，上下一體，羣策羣力，共赴事功，以造成水利事業之燦爛前途。希望此次會議完成三點工作：第一，確定水利建設之先後緩急及應興應革事宜；第二，檢討水利法施行以來之利弊得失，並準備修訂其他水利法令；第三，研討中央與地方對於水利建設之聯緊與配合之策。此外，薛氏並希望會中對水利學術之　進，水利人才之培育，水利經費之籌措，以及有關人事計政等事項，詳密研討，製成方案。</p>
<p>主席訓詞　勉繼續努力</p>
<p>蔣主席之訓詞全文如次：「中國以農立國，自古迄今，政府人民無不重視水利，其興廢足以影響政治之治亂與國運之盛衰。近世工商興起，水利事業日見推廣，關係國計民生尤切。國父手訂實業計劃，對此亦有重要指示，今當抗戰勝利。建國伊始，興辦水利，實爲經濟建設最重要之一環。顧水利事業雖屬繁重，簡要言之，不外興利除害。我國人口以農民居多，而今日農民在實際生活上所最需求者，厥爲防旱防澇，足衣足食。近歲國內各水利工程，以積有歷史經騐，輔以科學方法，多能圓滿完成，用收興利除害之效；例如前此之疏導淮河，修築引水渠堰，乃至最近之黃河堵口，均屬成績昭著，難能可貴。惟各項重要之水利建設，尚未開始，前程遙遠，不容一日暇逸。所望今後主管機關，權衡緩急，仍以江河之修防與農田之灌溉，列爲工作中心，進而再言航道之整理，與水力之開發，尤以工程與行政必須密切聯緊，中央與地方必須通力合作，庶幾指臂相連，標本兼治，而水利工作人員更應不斷努力，謀所貢獻，遠期克紹大禹奠定山川之前徽，近以實現國父實業計劃之遺敎，則國家富强康樂不難早致也。茲當全國水利會議開幕，特致數語，願共勉之。中正，辰，世」。</p>
<p>張院長詞　指陳三重點</p>
<p>張院長因出席國務會議，不及參加，特致畫面訓詞。渠指出欲來糧食自給，不能不努力發展水利事業，而工業化之資本，則須求自農業。張氏指陳今日我國水利事業應有三重點：（一）水利事業的目的，在於興利與除患，某一區域的水利應該如何興辦，某一區域的水患應該如何的消除，必須要有非常切實精密的計畫。（二）水利工程所需要的經費很多，現在正值大戰之後，國費很多，現在正值大戰之後，國內秩序還沒有恢復，財力物力都很艱苦，我們必須做到以最少的經費，最簡陋的物資，求得最多的成績。（三）水利部是一個政府機關，但水利事業却並不僅僅是政府的事業，我們必須要一方面獎勵民營，一方面利用外資，使中國的水利建設，地域上能够普遍，時間上能够迅速。</p>
<p>最後張氏勉以「人人都以大禹的精神爲精神，以大禹的事業爲事業，使中國的水利事業能迅速促成農業的繁榮，進而求得工業茲　的建立」。</p>
<p>大會通電　向主席致敬</p>

<h3>對今後水利建設之希望</h3>
<p>全國水利會議，昨於工程師節日，在京舉行開幕，會期預定爲六日，此爲水利部成立後首次全國性的水利會議，出席人員除各頃主管外，尚多水利工程專家。本屆討論主題，爲現行水利工作之檢討，戰後水利建設之規劃，中央及地方水利事業之聯繫與配合，及其他有關水利事項。吾人感於戰後水利事業之重要，對於此水利會議之召開，寄以無限期望。</p>
<p>中國是農業國家，自古至今，農田水利及河防工程，政府與人民無不重視。在歷史上，水利的典廢，關係政治的治亂與國連的盛衰至鉅。漢代賈讓，力首浚川疏河有三利，不通有三害；故其治河三策，歷代河官奉爲圭臬。宋代王安石執政變法，致力農田水利，至爲積極。後世顧亭林謂經國利民之道，更力倡興河渠，可以「返普天率土之人心，使之先義而後利」，爲施政之　務。足微國家之害，爲水利不興；而國家之利，端在浚川疏河，爲民興利，爲國迭福。現代科學昌明，天然力已構成公眾可供利用之資源；屯尼西河TVA水利工程，爲美國國民經濟最有價值之資源，工業動力之供應，源源不窮。中國號構以農立國，以工建國，現代化水利建設之需要，消極的爲防堵洪水，積極的爲便利灌溉，發展工業動力，此關係國民經濟前途，實深且鉅。勝利復原後，黃河花園口堵築成功，算是政府完成了一件大建設；惟黃河決堤之合龍，乃消極的不利建設，其積極的水利建設，實有賴新成立之水利部的努力，和全國水利工程專家，集中智慧的設計。茲就若干重要水利工作，約略有所論列，以供水利當局暨水利工程專家集會之參考。</p>
<p>一，黃河十年來決口，汛濫四省以上，於本年三月十五日合龍，廣大汛區人民同　歡慶，政府對河工人員的功勛，已予嘉獎。全國人士對此項偉大工程，莫不深切注意。現在汛區洪水雖去，遺留問題尚多，其關於水利工程者，如賈魯河，穎河，淝水，渦水，澮河，都因黃水汛濫，被泥沙淤塞，舊時河道，藹然無存。今後尚需在汛區從事　井，　蓄水庫，與開關河道。此項工程進，雖非若難民待哺之迫切，但如不能予以適當處置，將使汛區九百萬畝良田，於年後變成荒凉沙漠。惟此項工作所需經費較鉅，在目前財力情形下，是否可以一一做到，殊成疑問。希望水利當局及專家，能有縝密計劃。</p>
<p>二，長江爲中國之命脈，今日要興長江水利，必須疏治洞庭湖。湖南夙爲產米之區，最富的米源，就在洞庭湖濱肥沃之地。年來洞庭土壤淤積，每年長江上游水漲，加以湖南的各水流入洞庭，均因湖面不能容受，發生水患。據稱：洞庭湖底因淤積成廣大　田，不利於江水之宣洩，在有所謂刨毀「天祜垸」的爭執。現在水利當局已成立洞庭湖工程處，派有工程人員到湘，並撥定專款，治理洞庭。此項工程如能實現，其價值僅遷於黃河合龍。希望水利當局迅速進行，切實與湘鄂人民合作，從事洞庭之治理；並希望擴大堤防修築，進而與地方政府合作，設計堤防公路之開關。果爾，則未來之洞庭濱湖，經濟交通價值，將益趨重要，造福湘鄂諸省，當非淺鮮。</p>
<p>三，與長江水利工程互相有關聯的，尚有宜昌三峽水閘「揚域安」YVA水利工程，又稱爲「薩凡奇計劃」。此爲現代化最大的水利建設，設計甚久，已可告一段落。照原計劃規定，在宜昌掘開山石，打成地道；在地道設立發電廠，發電量爲一千萬瓩，除供給水閘所在地三百哩半徑所及區域外，高壓綫可東通南京，西連成都，南接貴陽，北及天水，漲受福利的人數，較美國全部人口爲多。不但長江灌溉得以改良，江水常年提高，便利巨輪航行，且有助西南諸省之工業建設，關係國家建設前途甚鉅。現在行政院感於國庫支細，認揚域安水利工程，爲「不急要之措施」，有停止勘測水量工程之決定。如不幸而竟半途作廢，此誠「江河日下」之現象，殊爲不智。希望水利當局暨水利工程專家，力爭此項工程之不可全廢，縱工程人員忍苦耐勞，儉省用度，亦必需逐步完成此唯一現代化的水利工程，爲國家奠立工業化的基礎。同時也希望行政院當局，在今日棼亂局面中，做一件砥柱中流的建設工作，以慰人心，切不可因噎廢食，半途停輟。創業本來是艱巨的事，需要在艱巨中。</p>
<p>以上所論，僅就目前水利建設營笙大者而言；他如各省地方小型水利之開辦，及與國外之技術合作，水利建設經費之　集等等，希望此次集會能有確實之計劃，日後更以克服洪水精神貫澈實現。新中國建設前途庶幾有光明燦爛的遠景。</p>
<h3>藉公營私貪污舞弊　盛世才受申誡處分　政務官懲戒會發表決議書</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕前新疆省政府主席盛世才，在任時藉公營私，貪污違法，由迪化維文總會電控，經監院查明，罪據確鑿，提案彈劾，呈奉國民政府發交政務官懲戒委會審議，業經審議竣事，議決：盛世才申誡。決議書全文如後：</p>
<p>主文：盛世才申誡。</p>
<p>事實：綠有新疆迪化維文總會等電訴該省前任主席盛世才藉公營私貪污違法一案於監察院，經同院令據新疆監察使署查復略稱，新疆警務處原轄有宜新肥皂廠一所，於民國二十七·八年間，該廠會採購棉花數十萬斤，至三十二年春間，該廠兼任經理鐵錕，奉命爲盛世才秘密經營商業，並令將廠中存棉貶值盜買四十餘萬斤，運往甘肅售出，復將所得價款購買大批雜貨運迪，於三十三年十月轉售，得價新幣八百四十六萬五千元，同年九月，盛世才內調前，鐵錕即携款赴蘭，共法幣七千餘萬元，（連同其他營業之款在內）投入華僑銀行，設立工廠，同年冬，前任警務處長李英奇等，電請中央提撥此項七千餘萬元，作爲救濟東北旅新被害難胞之用，盛氏得訊後，亦即簽呈，謂此項存款係中樞發彼之特別費，爲維持特工起見，遂令鐵錕代爲經營商業，嗣鐵錕　數交出，並登報敘述經過，以卸責任等語，經監察委員王述會審核，認爲該新疆省前主席盛世才，藉公營私，貪污牟利，殊屬違法，提案彈劾，請付懲戒，監察委員張慶楨，汪辟疆，劉成禺審查成立，由監察院呈奉國民政府發交到會。</p>
<p>理由：據被付懲戒人申辯略稱，新省孤懸塞外，民族複雜，爲明瞭內外各方情形，充實情報工作，實爲必要，但非有相當鉅款，不能辦理，而其機密性之重大，尤非如普通經費機要費開支，可供人閱覽故爲保持機密與節省省庫開支起見，乃有辦理棉花運銷之事，以其盈餘，供特別機密費之支應，至所購棉花，係照當時市價辦理，並無貶值之事，又世才率調離新時，棉花運銷業務尚未結清，當時估計，約可餘三千餘萬元，嗣經甘省保安司令部向經手人鐵錕追繳，則應結餘之款，後因物價高漲，實爲四千八百萬元（有甘省保安司令部代追鐵錕繳款處理書爲證）及息金一千萬元，除留給鐵錕三百萬元外，其餘五千五百萬元，已交世才收到，原案所謂七千餘萬元，實屬不符，且除棉花外，再無其他營業，原案所指連同其他營業之款在內一語，尤無其事，關於運銷棉花經過情形，及以盈餘作爲特別機密費辦法，並所餘之款可否交入省庫抑或補助世才本人及由新來內地貧苦舊屬生活費各節，曾於三十三年十一月十九日，呈報中央鑒核指示，並於十一月二十六日，奉准作爲世才等生活費之用，遵即陸續接濟由新回內地貧苦舊屬領用，計先後共支國幣五千六百零七萬二千五百七十六元，呈准之日，早在李溥霖等電請提作救濟費用之前，原劾所指世才得訊後簽呈謬稱此項存款係中樞發彼之特別費一節，不特時間之先後不同，世才無從得訊，而簽呈內容尤與實際不符，當係揣測之詞等語，本會查核被付懲戒人附呈證件，所稱運銷棉花經過，及以盈餘作爲特別機密費辦法，曾經呈報，所餘之款補助其本人及舊屬生活費一節，並經呈報奉准等情，尚非虛構，應免置議，惟查被付懲戒人購棉花一事，在三十二年春間即已開始，直至三十三年十一月，由新內調之後，始將辦理經過呈報，縱其運棉動機係因應公務需要，但未先呈准，即逕行從事，殊有未合，違法之咎，仍無可辭。</p>
<p>據上論結，被付懲戒人盛世才，有公務員懲戒法第二條第一款情事，依同法第三條第一項第五款，議決如主文。</p>

<h3>美允開放日本貿易　日藏相請速定匯率</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京六日電〕此間一般人士對於美國政府五日正式發表聲明，允許在兩個月之內開放日本民間對外貿易事，感覺異常興奮。矢野大藏大臣特發表談話稱：目前日本重開對外貿易及安定國民生活之最大障碍，乃對外匯率之不能決定。今爲準備民間對外貿易之重開，首先希望盟國迅速決定匯率問題。又爲增加輸出商品之生產量，日本政府已準備採取斷然措置，如決定物價及撲減黑市等。日本一般經濟界對於美國此項聲明，與矢野之態度一致。又日本貿易界以此項感覺愉快，認爲重開地外貿易後，（一）可以使交易活潑化，（二）可明瞭何種商品適於輸出貿易。</p>

<h3>美參院正式批准　對義羅保匈和約</h3>
<p>須待法蘇丙佃批准後始能生效</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕美國參議院已於今夜批准義大利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞及匈牙利四國和約，首先表決者爲義國和約，以七十九票對十票通過。羅保匈三國和約旋依次以口頭表決通過。在表決之先，反對派領袖民主黨參議員傅爾勃萊特猶國作最後嘗試，以使和約之批准延至明年一月舉行，此一修正案當被以六十七票對二十二票否決。參議員康諾利於表決以前，曾作最後呼籲，謂拒絕批准對義和約，足以引起義大利之混亂，使共產主義得以乘機大事侵入義國。反對派在今日之辯論中，力量異常薄弱。民主黨參議員麥克馬翁表示，余相信對義和約之批准與否，與世界持久和平並無多大影響，美國之任務，僅在使義大利不致步匈牙利後塵，墜入共產黨之陰謀。義大利如成共產附庸，則數星期後法國亦將進入同一路綫。果爾，則希特勒所擬完成之目標，可由蘇聯繼之完成矣。麥克馬翁並對英美軍撤出義大利後之情形，表示恐懼。渠云：蘇聯已侵入匈牙利，而英美則將自義大利撤退。此項撤退，或即爲蘇聯取得義大利之信號云。德前附庸國之和約，茲已經英美兩國批准，尚待蘇法兩國批准，並將批准寄送達巴黎或莫斯科，始能生效。</p>
<h3>保加利亞反蘇派領袖　彼特柯夫遭逮捕　保總理抨擊杜魯門主義</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播：肅清巴爾幹反蘇領袖之運動，刻已擴大至保加利亞。據英外交部透露：關於傳說中之匈牙利反民主陰謀，蘇聯拒絕提供證據。共黨支配下之保加利亞政府已將抨擊蘇聯最力之農民全國統一黨領袖彼特柯夫逮捕。據保加利亞消息靈通方面稱：彼特柯夫之被捕，爲打擊保加利亞反共運動之先聲云。</p>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦五日電〕莫斯科廣播五日摘述保加利亞總理狄米脫洛夫之言，指斥美總統杜魯門正在煽動反民主之法西斯風潮。據稱，狄氏接見倫敦「每日郵報」記者費歇爾之時，費氏請其對杜魯門最近關於巴爾幹之演說發表意見。狄氏答稱，「余雖尊敬此一大國之總統，但不得不鄭重聲明，據余之意，美總統目前之演說。乃在鼓勵反民主份子及法西斯政權之重振旗鼓，因此，不能認爲此項演說對和平及民主有所貢獻。余並不認爲此項演說有助於消除巴爾幹若干國家間所存在之互不信任態度，或有助於建立巴爾幹之和平與安全」。</p>

<h3>銀根忽又轉緊永紗一路下降　小型股稍見平穩</h3>
<p>華股昨銀根忽又轉緊，業中多頭驟吿潰散，保證金三成概須現金，業外人趦趄不前，交易倍形寥落，環境上裂痕又多，小型股雖尙平和，但永紗則形成一面倒，逐步下降。火柴商務且吿跌停，前途仍將趨盤。</p>
<p>晨開因隔前國行差出數巨，頗行穩健，各股開高。遞永紗開後，二七號一八六號俱進，曾升至六八二〇元，一九〇號一一七號一五四號一三三號二二三號二三一號七六號三一號一〇二號一五五號八九號脫手，逐漸下游，退至六六三〇元。一四號二二四號九七號一九七號七六號趁低曾來維持，升爲六八〇〇元外，九一號三六號二八號賣到六七〇〇元內。一〇五號二三五號微納而稍盤，八九號一八〇號一五五號一〇五號二四號二〇三號三二號脫售更殷，聞銀根見緊異常；中央路方面風聲不利，，交貨又極困難，人心不支而降爲六四〇〇元內。十一時左右，市價在六四〇〇元內外，形成拉鋸，無何，三二號力加脫手，一八〇號四七號一三七號四四號賣到六二〇〇元，一二九號進後亦出，復吿下游。三一號二二六號三二號二二四號一二九號一四八號二二三號紛賣，港申電報縮至十四元二，仍吿下游，遞永紗跌至六〇五〇元。現永紗亦見五八七〇元低價，火柴由二二四號，商務由一一二號跌停矣。一八六號一七七號九一號一八五號二二四號來納，午收升爲六一七〇元。收復喊價平平，結果較前收計即交股永紗永公華豐勤興中法新華各跌半成左右，信和新光微挫，景福微升，火柴商務跌至停限，麗安內衣中絲榮豐跌一成左右，新亞國貨景綸大通尙平，統益中紡跌半成。遞交各股計永紗永公華豐信和各跌半成，新光景福微降，勤興跌一成弱，塲外各老服計大生三廠有賣少買，再跌半成外，餘股榮辱俱微。</p>
<h3>五種公債　定期抽籤還本</h3>
<p>財政部二十五年統一公債戊稱債票，二十七年振濟公債，三十年建設公債第二期債票，卅一年同盟勝利公債，卅三年同盟勝利公債等五種公債，財部定六月十一日在滬公開舉行抽籤還本。</p>
<h3>紡建外銷紗布</h3>
<p>本年度數量可望增加</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司辦理紗布外銷，原則上已決定爲該公司產量十分之一。據該公司吳副總經理語記者：該公司本年度棉紗產量，大致可增加至八十萬件以上。以此數十分之一外銷，全年外銷數額，紗將達四萬件，布約達一百三十萬疋。紗每件以美金三百元計，布每疋以美金十二元計，則全年紗布外銷後所掙回之外匯，將達美金二千七百六十萬元云。</p>
<h3>紗布均疲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市初開，市仍堅昂，嗣以紡建公司售紗，價鮮變動，市塲人心轉餒，浮戶散多遂起新殺，價乃下挫。結果四二支藍鳳跌至一千二百九十萬元爲收價，比上日軋小七萬元，全日市勢廿支及十六支紗互有參差外，三十二支及四二支各牌細紗跌小自五萬至一二十萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况，晨開因聞漢口運銷管制有取銷之說，人心興奮，零星收吸不弱，市勢趨俏，詎至收時，傳紗價下挫，散多爭先拋售，市轉疲軟。結果四君子金印嗶嘰跳　斜紋，江西帮見低有吸，漂布府綢及高士林布，本街補進，市尙堅挺，其餘細布細斜，均見疲軟。</p>
<h3>到源存在了底均寡　秋冬呢羢暢銷</h3>
<p>夏貨呢羢，標準紊亂，有實力與門莊者仍多扳堅不肯廉沽。反之，悉肯削價脫手。故茶會上成交行情，往往不同。秋冬需銷之深色呢羢，中西裝花呢宣維，嗶嘰華達呢，麥爾登大衣呢等，昨咸有成交。本客帮有餘力者，相繼搜辦。因細毛光質呢羢嗶機，運到及產存日寡，預料秋令　必再見高升。</p>
<h3>美金債劵　各業公會募銷定四週內結束</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於各業公會之債券募銷事宜，聞美金債券募銷委員會，將於下還一起，再召集各業公會洽談。大致定四週內，結束各業公會之募銷事宜。至六區棉紡公會所認購之債券，業由中信局與該會訂立契約，由該會各會晨廠，提供棉紗若干，一方面商請中國紡建公司協助，提供棉紗若干，交由中信局外銷。所得外匯，即充購債資金。</p>
<h3>第二季外棉輸入　國行訂定結匯粉法　得改憑外棉核配證購買</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行爲本年五月至七月份，外棉輸入限額之申請結匯事，昨日發出通函第一〇一號，致指定銀行，茲錄其內容如下：</p>
<p>「關於輸入臨時管理委員會輸入限領分配處核定，本年第二季（五月至七月份）棉花輸入限額，業輕中央銀行商訂辦法，由紐約花旗銀行中國銀行紐約經理處，曁紐約大通銀行，予以資金之融通。該項外棉之委託購買證，得向上海花旗銀行及中國銀行國外部開立，並應由指定銀行通知各紗廠知照。其應辦手續，可比照本行前公布之第九十五號通函規定辦理。</p>
<p>輸入限額分配處，鑒於可得出口津貼之美棉限額裝運之念迫已考慮將前行規定紗廠須持有輸入許可證，方得開立委託購買證之規定，予以取銷。對於是項美棉，指定銀行得改憑外棉核配委員會簽發之外棉核配證，開立委託購買證，其金額以不超過核配證所規定訂購棉花數量所必需者爲度。各指定銀行尤須注意者，此項外棉核配證，僅規定核准訂購外棉之數量，故須特別審愼核對，委託購買證所申請之外匯金額，（延期提運損耗等費應予除外。）</p>
<p>一俟輸入許可證簽發，各指定銀行仍須按照向例，將結售外匯之詳細紀錄，登記於該證之背面。」</p>
<h3>食米到多介跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市來源驟暢，昨松靑帮到船不少，蘇錫常來貨亦多，正在上卸中。市塲登記雖祗五千餘石，實際到貨在萬石以上。市上因見貨暢旺，市氣見軟，人心徘徊，多觀望不前，成交稀少，各貨一致下跌。高白粳回至四十二萬五，跌落一二萬元。</p>
<p>麪粉消化閒散，新麥已見，人心虛軟，回低一二千元。麩皮鄕銷動而不旺，勢成站局。豆餅客帮伴辦，早堅午淡，形趨軟化。黃豆油廠採納，漢口乍豆及東北大豆，均見轉漲在王千元，杜黃豆仍平。赤豆胃呆下挫三五千元，茶豆逐步下降，再跌三五千元</p>
<p>紅糧去化動而不旺，續跌三五千元。苞米北洋不動，續削三五千元。芝蔴洋莊活躍，回漲萬元。生仁挺秀，陳麥立定，新小麥來源尙未見旺，暫無榮辱。新蠶豆高貨另化略動，價形暫平，惟下等者仍在看小之中。新元麥因貨身欠佳，顧主難覓，挫落三五千元。油市店胃尙可，續升萬元，午時轉淡，動盪尙少。</p>
<p>又訊：四川省雜糧漸漸東下，若苞米生仁菉豆已相繼抵申，酒精亦已到申，而川米價格又低，客商均擬前往採辦。米業公會已有證明書，辦理客商川米運申。</p>
<h3>蘇聯擬在香港採購中國紅茶</h3>
<p>中央社香港六日電，據悉蘇聯駐香港商業代表，頃與當地茶商交涉，擬購中國紅茶一千担。一般觀察家相信，蘇聯轉而注意香港市塲，其最大因素，爲中國外匯官價過高之故。最近此地茶市蕭條，中國紅茶由侮担一百六十美元跌至每担八十美元。</p>
<h3>買方希望又成泡影　統債跌風甚厲　外股環境不佳亦均下挫</h3>
<p>公債昨以報載參會之倍數償還提案，已遭保留，而兪財長更作强調之聲明，買方希望又成泡影，慘吿潰散。統丙晨開即跌爲九五〇〇元，低至七五〇〇元。而後升上至八三〇〇元左右結束。寳隆及散多俱斬五〇三室有補，在六百餘萬之成交下，較前收計甲乙丁跌三千四，統丙降落四千八，統戊亦挫三千七。</p>
<p>外股昨以證券帮及散戶存貨再售，環境悲觀。港申電雖有報縮至十四元二，無濟大局。怡紗自晨初六五五〇〇元起，降低至六〇〇〇〇元關邊，而後稍平。結果較前收計英聯航業怡啤各跌半成，怡紗鋼業各降一成左右，餘股均吿小挫。</p>
<h3>紡管會核定　南北運紗布數額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會昨日發表北運紗布廠商審査經過各情如次：（一）工廠車請登記，經審査合格者一三三家。（二）運銷商申請登記，經審査合格者二五六家。（三）南運工廠登記合格，已領登記卡者一五六家。（四）廠商申請登記，審查不合格者一〇〇家。該會已定九日通知各廠商。各核准廠商接通知後，須於三日內，携帶原印鑑，赴該會領取登記卡，俟登記卡手續辦竟後，該會即將本月份北還紗布限額，分別通知各廠商。預計本月十六日，即可開始接受申請紗布北運。</p>
<p>本月份南運紗布限額，亦經該會核算竟事，發表如次：棉紗方面：上月餘額二五八件，加本月原限額二九六七件，本月棉紗南運總限額，爲三二二五件。棉布方面：上月餘額一三〇三疋，加本月原限額七五六四七疋，本月棉布南運總限額爲七六九五〇疋。專案方面：紗仍爲二千件。布上月餘額二〇七五九疋，加本月原限額三五〇〇〇疋，本月專案南運布爲五五七五九疋。該會將於今日將該項數字，通知各南運廠商。本月十一日，即可開始接受申請紗布南運。</p>
<h3>茶銷活動</h3>
<p>洋莊茶市，昨日交易漸見活動，但價將方面，卒乏變遷。至於紅綠茶內銷續暢，且尤以微烘，珠繭等綠茶，脫手較形順利。惟行情則受貨品關係，比隔日軒輊互有。茲悉：最近津帮對於綠茶芯，忽又注視，聞每担以三萬五六千元間，大有來者不拒之勢。但貨方以此低價不忍割愛，因此成交與否，尙在醞釀中。</p>
<h3>捲菸市仍萎靡</h3>
<p>昨日香烟市氣因外埠同行轉賣不寂，塲內人心閑散，躉批交易甚鮮做開祇有零星添補。晨開時十支大英姻爲六百四十萬元，嗣後步步下挫，午後更形不振，兼聞香港基降方面帶來茄力克香姻甚多，兜售者活躍，最後十支大英姻價小至六百廿六萬五千元，比上日續瀉十五萬五千元，老刀小三萬元，五華小六萬元，哈德門小九萬元。全日市勢中外各廠紙姻及聽頭香烟一致下降，只有金　及大克雷斯　斧等二三牌，脚地較硬。</p>
<h3>民用煤八千噸　議價已經核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燃管會第二期一般用戶　煤八千噸，前親物價評議會　　小組第二次會議議定價格，經主任委員吳開先核准爲：開灤二號統煤每噸五十萬，阜新統煤每噸五十五萬五千，美國納子白煤每噸八十三萬六千，美國小子白煤每噸七十萬二千。各貨皆在上海綫房交貨。配煤對象爲小型工廠，酒菜館，廚房，飯店等。於本月十一日後開始配售。</p>
<h3>輪船業客貨運費　增加成數不一</h3>
<p>本市輪船業公會，前派員晋京要求取消貼補實行同業價議辦法，於本月起調整各綫客貨運費。據悉：交通部對該業一請求，原則上已予同意，該會乃於前日召開費率委員會，擬訂加價標準，並請昨下午理監事聯席會議決定，將所擬調整價格，呈請交通部核定。據悉：該業要求調整之客貨運費，分南北洋綫，滬甬綫，長江綫，對江綫四種。增加成數並不一律，計南北洋綫加百分之一百五十，滬雨綫長江綫次之，對江綫加百分之一百。至調整日期，該業希望在月中之前實行。</p>
<h3>五月份　輸入許可證　核准四千餘件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會發表該會五月份核准之輸入申請及簽發之輸入許可證，詳情如次：</p>
<p>核准申請書　簽發許可證</p>
<p>第一附表　一四五三件　一三六八件</p>
<p>第二附表　三八三件　一〇三〇件</p>
<p>第三附表　一六二五件　五三九件</p>
<p>第三附表之輸入許可證，原歸非限額審核處簽發，自五月十七日起，始一律改併由輸入品管理處簽發。故本月份積壓較多，六月可以全部淸理。</p>
<h3>冰蛋一千七百噸　昨日首批運英</h3>
<p>春夏二季即三四五六四個月，爲我國各地晨村產蛋最盛時期。本年度外匯調整時，英國曾向我訂購冰蛋五千噸，出口商因價格不合，拒絕簽約。後經中央信託局允予輔助出口，雙方始獲解法，即由中信局以每噸九百萬之價格收購，再運英國。昨日中信局輔助蛋商運出一千七百噸，尙有三千三百噸，蛋商復再表示不願出售，因成本較前高漲八成，若按舊價收購，虧蝕甚鉅。中信局現正考慮增加收價，俾維合約云。</p>

<h3>醫藥界迷戀骸骨</h3>
<p>— 文斯</p>
<p>五月十日，當筆者參加中華醫學會大會的閉幕式的時候，突然由座後的一位老朋友，遞給我一張剪報，當時並沒有顯得去細讀，就隨手放到口袋裏，因為「獻給醫學會」一類的文章，在大會期中，實在多得很，而且也沒有軒輊的。會後幾天，重讀這份剪報，却如晴天的霹靂，使我不得不驚呆了！</p>
<p>「中醫」不科學，反科學，這是鐵的事實，現在居然仍有人說它是「文化遺產」，認為「這種醫學並不是完全沒有價値的，它治好了許多病，它有許多很好的原始或未精煉的獎物，它用五行之說來解　生理現象根據把脉判斷病情，作為對症下藥的根據，往往並不差誤」，堂而皇之的辨論它的「不科學」與「反科學」！而且說：「對於五行生理現象說剖析的論文都沒有見過，朱免覺得遺憾」！</p>
<p>實在說，在現時代，現社會，還有這種言論的出現，倒可以認為是遺憾。二十年前，評論舊醫不科學，反科學的文字，雖不能說是汗牛充棟，却也不是絕對沒有。余雲岫先生的醫學革命論集，和靈素問兌，是其中最有系統的鉅著。陳方之先生對舊醫的評論亦多，這兩位科學醫師，還都健在。戰前天津大公報醫學週刊，十幾年前，亦常有對舊醫的評論。這些老書報，在現今的書攤上，自是不能見到。生得晚的人，要看這些東西，祗好到有歷史性的圖書館裏，像國立北平圖書館，去搜尋了。可見硏究科學醫學者「否定舊醫學的價値」是在幾十年以前便確定了！</p>
<p>國產革業與玄學的舊醫學說，不可併作一談。人類未開化的時代，祗有魔術式的神秘的巫醫。魔術容易揭穿，不足似惑識者，於是有玄學的階段。及至科學發達，醫學纔入了科學的正軌，要證據，重實騐。玄學的醫是翳學發展史上的一個階段，個個民族都是如此。五行並不是中華民國的特產，印度有四行，歐西也有四液體質。他們五十年前的醫醫裏充滿了這種玄說，就是今日，也還有很多的遺跡存在。在中國的舊醫學說襄想發掘出一些「瓖寳」來，許多人有這樣的夢，仍有少數人在努力不過，以中國醫學人材之奇缺，許多重要的工作需人去作，有發掘經騐的人，多不主張有為的醫學家去做這種不急之務。社會中之所以有這種要求，是惑於舊醫「治好了許多病。」所謂「治好，」實在是「貪天之功」。</p>
<p>舊醫的佔價早已確定。我們的東鄰，黷武固然愚拙，他們對於科學的認識，却不能不說是遠比中國人聰明。科學醫學的發達可以媲美歐西。對於皇漢聲學更早在中國以前就確定了估價，採取了斷然的處置。所以日本已經沒有新舊醫的糾紛。就是台灣，在四十幾年以前，淪入敵手的初期，他們就以一次登記舊翳，以後永不再行登記的辦法，用時間將其淘汰。難這說：日本人比我們更不科學，更缺乏科學精神麼？</p>
<p>到了這廿世紀的中葉，科學昌明到人類能利用原十能的時代。中國的士大夫，還把玄學時代的落伍舊醫，奉為經典，這眞好像是一位頑固的古董家在迷戀骸骨！</p>
<h3>小兒扁桃腺炎　所引起的惡果</h3>
<p>— 楊士達</p>
<p>扁桃腺俗名乳蛾，是兩顆桃核樣大的腺體，生在咽峽的兩旁邊，左右各一顆。在一吞秋兩季氣候更換時期，小兒思本症的尤多。市立第四醫院小兒科門診部十一及十二月份共診一七七一人，患扁桃腺炎的小兒有九九人，的百份之五以上。這個數字當然祗包括一小部分，大部分的兒童患了扁桃腺炎，因感着喉嚨痛，投耳鼻咽喉科診治了。這個報告告訴我們：扁桃腺炎是小兒病中一個不可忽視的疾病，牠能引起許多惡果，許多的家長們對於割除手術的勸告，很多加以懷疑，不　接受，以致併發症相繼而來，甚至喪生也不是意外想不到的。現在把扁桃腺炎的症狀及能引起的惡果寫在後面，給患扁桃腺炎的小兒家長作參考。</p>
<p>扁桃腺炎的症狀</p>
<p>常患扁桃腺炎的小兒多數是身體衰弱事的，在氣候更換的季節，突然呈現不舒適，高熱，頭痛，疲倦，消化不良，幼兒同時能發驚厥。經過這個劇烈的前奏曲後，局部的病狀漸漸顯著起來，咽腔感覺乾燥，疼痛，嚥物發生困難，在這個時期，於查口咽腔就可發見咽峽兩傍突出桃核樣的扁桃腺紅腫，上面塗着一層黏液，或者散佈着幾顆白點，下顎角的淋巴腺也受影響，輕度腫脹與疼痛，經過幾天適當的治療，扁桃腺的紅腫漸漸會退除，但是復發是不可免的，遇到輕度的疲乏或受到了些風寒，驚人的症狀又會發現出來，於是乎這些兒業成為我們小兒科醫師的常年主顧。</p>
<p>扁桃腺炎併發症</p>
<p>扁桃腺經過多次發炎後成為各種病菌的收容所，一待有機會這些病菌就要向人體內進攻，最容易被害的部分為扁桃腺附近的各器管構成：</p>
<p>（甲）中耳炎及副鼻腔炎（　炎）：許多的小兒終年耳道流着黃艦水，極困難治愈，不幸的時候，還能引起腦膜炎，或乳實炎。還有副鼻腔炎（俗名腦漏）鼻腔裏不時點滴流出奇臭的膿液，都是由扁桃腺窠藏的病菌，傳染進去，引起的病變。</p>
<p>（乙）頸淋巴腺膿瘍：抵抗力衰弱的小兒，扁桃腺經過幾次的發炎後，頸部的淋巴腺內拘留着病菌過多的時候，也會化膿成瘡，須要用外科手術，才能治愈</p>
<p>（丙）敗血症：最不幸的時候，扁桃腺窠藏的病菌能侵入到血液流襄，引起敗血病（血中有病菌發育）在這種情形之下，扁桃腺炎發作幾天之後，一般徵象轉劇，病勢轉成傷寒模樣，體溫增高至三九至四〇度，腹瀉，蛋白尿，病勢的進展能很迅速，經過短時間即宜告死亡，或在進展的過程中，發見各器臟的併發症，如內外心包炎，肋膜炎，關節炎，腎炎，腦模炎，紫斑病，及粘節性紅斑。扁桃腺炎最容易併發的為：</p>
<p>（丁）關節疾病：這是小兒科臨床方面常見的事實，小兒患扁桃腺炎後，接踵而起的各種關節病態有：關節疼痛，關節水腫，亞急性多發性關節炎。</p>
<p>（戊）腎炎：小兒的腎炎，多數由扁桃腺炎起的，因此，病後小兒的小便，應當時常加以檢查。腎臟所受到的影響能够極輕徽，祗有纖查出輕度的蛋白尿在能證實。但有紋重的損害通到如血尿性腎炎或水腫性　炎，大概鹽床，不致於忽略的。蛋白尿亦有自始即成慢性狀態，每次扁桃腺炎發作時，蛋白尿加劇，成為終身難治之症。現今所謂寒冷性腎炎皆為扁桃腺炎所引起的，似乎不可加以否認的事實。</p>
<p>扁桃腺炎的治療</p>
<p>扁桃腺炎旣能行起危險的惡果就病的初起時，就要作速治療，不要使其釀成後忠。除了幾種特殊的病菌以外如白喉，須要注射白喉血淸，文生氏旋體構成的扁桃腺炎須要注射九一四，最新的治療法是內服及注射「配尼西林」收効極快。一待發炎徵候消失就可以施行割除手術經專家施術可以說無痛苦，也無多大的危險。</p>
<h3>孕婦及產褥之衛生</h3>
<p>— 江峨英</p>
<p>生產本來是自然的現象，並不是病理的變化，但是因為生產，身體各部份增加了負擔，所以本來身體有隱藏的毛病，到那時就顯著地爆發的現象，生起病來，在初產婦方面更為顯著，所以反轉來說孕婦比平時更宜注意衛生與身體之健康。孕婦應行注意之衛生要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）飮食：懹孕時之飮食極關重要，雖不需特種之食物，但有數種食物較平時少吃，如肉類。而有幾種宜多食如牛乳，乳油，及新鮮蔬菜多維他命之類，並有少數食物以禁忌為妙，如酸辣酒之類。孕時飮食，可謂食品宜簡單，烹調宜淸潔，蛋白質應减少如大魚大肉之類，炭水化物如米麥之製品宜增多，銬鹽及維他命之供給應充分，並多飮水份，肉食每日只可一次以節省腎臟之排洩，且肉類之數種產物據近代之研究，在孕時確有毒性。</p>
<p>炭水化物之量應當增加，即飯或麫等物增多，因胎兒需動物澱粉之量多，取給於母體為維持正當之新陳代謝，食物中含碳鹽類如銬質之量應充足，以使小兒之需要，尤以在姙娠之最後三月中孕婦自體亦須儲有，以備哺乳之用；常有牙齒變脆弱而腐壞，且孕時骨質軟化，又鈣質可防止毒血症之發生，鈣質多存在牛乳鷄蛋及靑菜等食物，需多含維他命對於母體及胎兒均有大益，所以最好產婦多服鈣片及魚肝油等</p>
<p>（二）身體運動：須每日行之，孕婦所喜之家常事務及社會之活動，勵其繼纖行動，散步在孕之各期皆有益，惟峧劇烈之運動及競賽，則宜停止，倘因故不能運動，可按摩其四肢亦可。劇烈運動及長途汽車或火車旅行，在孕之初三月內更宜小心易致流產。最後三月，須多加休息，並於餐後寬衣偃臥一小時，能入睡尤佳</p>
<p>（三）淸潔：身體須淸潔，陰部尤為重要，倘不能每日洗溫水浴，則下部必須用肥皂常洗之，每日早起早睡，呼吸新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>（四）衣服：須寬鬆，以免壓迫胸腰部，在姙娠之後期，孕宮向前，致覺不舒，可用彈力性腹帶。</p>
<p>（五）便秘：全部孕期中常有之現象，可多服水份，水菓，倘此簡單方法無効時，可用緩寫劑，但有力瀉劑宜禁絕，在姙娠之後期，乳部常洗滌，使分泌腺不致污積，發育增進。</p>
<p>（六）齒之衛生，很是重要，應常檢查口腔，有無齲齒，及膿毒，倘有之宜就牙醫診治，在孕時任何膿毒病灶，皆有危險，蓋可為產後傳染之要道。</p>
<p>孕期中宜常請醫師檢查，以减少生產時之種種不幸，檢查小便，有無　臟變化，以防將來子　發生，脚氣病有否？亦需隨時注意，有了脚病能影響心臟不良，因心臟不良，就生產時有危險發生，即使不十分利害，則將來產後及嬰兒健康均有影響。</p>
<p>產褥之衛生</p>
<p>產後期禍稱產褥期，普通稱之謂月內，在剛正生產後，產婦之全身情形，不過為身體疲勞，久之，或顯甚著之產後力竟竭，體溫高百度（三二眶七度八）或尤高，可認為無甚關係，此初產婦尤為常見，體溫之升約由於肌，力過勞之反應，至第二日即全退，其熱罕有過廿四小時者。產後期體溫升高之關係，初尙不　，至廿四小時以上者為病之表示，宜請醫診視。</p>
<p>在產後二三日內，大抵精神萎頓，食慾不振，因此只能進液體或易消化之固體食物，但身體碩壯之婦女，或不顯消化力减弱之現象，在初數日內，大便往往秘結，可服瀉劑，大便通順則精神爽暢。陰部淸潔：惡露，係產後起有二三星期內，由生殖道所流出之液體，初為紅色，後漸變淡紅色而至無液體。陰部之淸潔為產褥中最重要之事項，蓋分娩尤以初產婦，子宮口，窒道，外陰部及會陰等處，常有多少裂傷之存在，益以排出惡露之污染，極易發生創傷傳染；故分娩後一週內，至少每日二回，用百分之一來沙而或錶錳　等之消毒液洗滌其，後塗以百分之一，紅汞，上覆以消毒棉花紗布，及後紗布潤濕，即須交換。</p>
<p>（二）乳房之處置：母乳為育兒最良之榮養品故產婦非有特別不得己之情形，務必自行哺乳。此不獨對小兒營養上，即對本身之生殖器復舊機能，亦有極重要之促進作用，乳房即當充盈脹大，而宜開始授乳，哺乳之前後，宜用百分之三硼酸水或溫開永拂拭乾淨，如有表皮剝亂或小裂傷，則於授乳後塗以硼竣軟膏。</p>
<p>（三）飮食，吾國舊習，對於產婦，必使攝取酒，醋，　及鷄等，此三物刺激性最劇烈，常足引起疾病，切官禁食。至鷄一項，雖宜於營養，但產褥期身體全無運動，難於消化。至初二三日多食慾不振，可給以牛奶麵包鷄蛋等易消化物，至一星期食慾稍開可服鷄汁，但刺激性仍宜禁忌。</p>
<p>（四）精神狀態，產褥婦精神極易惑動，一切喜怒哀樂之舉動，皆宜避免，牀上在可能範圍，作牀上運動，即以臂腿伸曲及升落，並深呼吸，能佐助消化，改善全身情形，且可矯正因孕時過張之腹肌而助其恢復緊張力。</p>
<h3>醫藥通問</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>嗣芬先生：</p>
<p>讀了你的來信使我非常同情你的境遇。人們都是想求生的，生了病的人更加想求生。可是生在這棵無暗的社會裏，貧苦的病人簡直就沒有辦法去求醫。雖然說是有了許多慈善性質的機關，（如翳院以及什麼救濟所之類），可是它們大半都是虛有其表的裝飾品而已，事實上是絕對不會給予貧苦的病者以實惠的。要想希望政治能修上軌道，社會能够安定，一切貧病的人都能够得着合理的救治，那末惟有期之於「將來的將來」吧！關於這些問理，實在是太複雜了，決不是一時所能談得了的，而且也不是我們翳生和病家所談得了的，我們惟有拉回來再談我們現在所要談的東西。</p>
<p>不錯，我們是醫生，是為病人們解救痛苦的，可是因為社會的黑暗，連我們也感覺得到受了社會黑暗的威脅。我們只要看看你的來信，就可以曉得聲界裏的另一角了。固然，醫生也是人，他們也要吃飯的，可是，那種不負責任的態度和那些商業一性質很重的氣息不單只要使一般病家望之却步，就是拿我們醫生來說，看了也覺得非常慚愧。我可以預想到你對於那種態度的不滿。而且誠如你先生所證的：「在目下這社會裏，像我這樣的人太多了。而同時我又太難求得聲治的條件了」，我們常常感覺到社會上實在缺少這麼一個為貧病服務的機構。而我們自已的力量又實在太薄弱了。你只要想一想看，你的來信是四月廿八日寄來的，而我這篇答覆却延遲到現在才來寫，這眞是答覆得太遲了，可是我得告訴你，一方面因為來信太多，他方面又因為自己的瑣事太忙，所以只能力不從心地躭擱下來了。唉！不談也罷！我們只能盡一份的力量做我們自己的一份事而已。現在就提出你的問題來討論吧！</p>
<p>照你的病情來說，恐怕還是慢性肺結核最為可能。雖則愛克司光檢查說是氣管炎，但是那位醫師又勸你注射維他命C及葡萄糖銬，我總以為他在善意地騙你，免得你聽了他的宣告「患有肺結核」而過份恐懼，影響到你的整個心理。不過，我得告訴你，患肺病並不是絕症，只要你自己能够「及時」醫治和找得正當的療治。我現在希望你去照一張愛古司光片（在中美醫院拍攝較廉），這或許可以使你得到較為正確的診斷。至於治撩方面，我以為有了診斷之後總可以有辦法的。除了肺部方面，我以為你也許同時患有慢性胃粘膜炎及胃下垂等症。但是也許是沒有眞正的胃病，丙為患肺結核病的人往往可以有胃部的病象，其實胃部本身並沒有什麼器官性的病變的。</p>
<p>是後，我得附帶告訴你一聲：我們覺得有許多服務於文化界的人士患了病無處求醫而且也無力求醫，這對於文化的工作方面實在影響太大了，因此我們正在計劃成立一種康健福利會，目的是使每個服務於文化的工作者都能够以最低廉的代價行到康健方面的保障。雖然這種工作非常艱鉅，但是我們總希望能够促其成功的。</p>

<h3>勞作美術在國民敎育中之地位</h3>
<p>— 胡叔異</p>
<p>要討論勞作美術在國民敎育中之地位，先要說明國民敎育的精神所在？自中央頒布了縣各級組織綱要之後，敎育部決定將義務教育與失學民衆補習敎育合而爲一，改稱爲國民敎育。其目標在空間是要全國各地同時建立起普及敎育運動，這種運動要配合政治建設和經濟建設向着建國目標，邁步前進，迎頭趕上。在時間上要適應國情和當地需要，規定進行程序，分期掃除全國文盲，究成敎育建設的重要任務。從此我們可以斷定國民敎育，是現階段建國進程中之一種敎育建設運動。所以國民敎育之精神，第一，管敎養衛合一的敎育。第二，兒實敎育與成人補習敎育合一的敎育。第三，學校敎育與社會敎育合一的敎育。可是這三種合一的敎育制度，都與勞作美術科有密切的關係。規在分別申述在下面：</p>
<p>（一）勞作的敎育目的簡單的分析，有三種：第一，是要訓練勞動的身手；第二，是要培養創造的能力；第三，是要培養生產的與趣。我們知道從前的小學敎育只知道「敎」的設施，對於地方自治事業中「管」「養」「衛」三項重要工作，並沒有想到，現在的國民教育新制，除了對兒童與成人施敎以外，兼注意到民衆的組織，生產技能之培養，與自衛能力之訓練。這裏的生產技能之培養一層，完全是勞作敎育應該達到的重要目標之一。至於勞動身手和創作能力，對於民衆組織與自衛能力，都有密切的關係。因爲組織民衆與實行自衛，在地方自治工作中要把中心國民學校和國民學校做中心出發點；非培養每個兒童每個成人和侮個婦女，有創造的能力，和勞動的身手不可，要一返從前死讀書，讀死書的壞習慣。使國民學校敎出來的兒童和成人都能主持社會活動和地方事業，使國民敎育眞精神的管敎養衛合一的敎育，可以實現。這樣說來勞作科在國民敎育中的地位是何等的重要！我們要實現國民敎育的眞精神，非重視勞作敎育不可。</p>
<p>（二）我們旣承認國民敎育是地方建設性的敎育，在地方建設一切過程中，要利用人們愛美的天性，來完成美化的地方建設，是誰也不能否認的。譬如說，美化的都市計劃，與美化的鄕邨設計，在每一個國民的心腦中，都有同樣的理想和一致的要求；所以培養每一個兒童成人和婦女，先要具有美的欣賞和識別的程度，同時陶冶他們對於美的發表和創造，是完成建設性國民敎育的重要工作。這種重要工作，完全要靠美術敎育來達到。這是說美術科敎育在國民敎育中也佔有極重要的位置。我們要實現國民敎育的眞精神，也非重視美術科敎育不可！</p>
<p>從前國算唯一主義的小學敎育，沒有認淸勞作美術的眞正敎育目標，所以把勞美二科，列爲技能科，可有可無，無關大體！當然在認勞美的手工和圖需科的錯誤觀念下，決不認識幣美敎育的重要，唯有澈底明瞭勞美敎貿的眞義，才知道勞美在國敎的地位，決非手工和圖書科，可以同日而語。再說；最近英美初等敎育，十分重視「工作」和「發表」的敎育價値，在小學校裏，特別設置Work　Shop工作室和作業室，從這一層，更可證明勞美科對於基層的國民敎育，確有客觀的獨特的敎育價値。</p>
<h3>佛萊斯·薛石克</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>向全市兒童美術敎育工作者推荐</p>
<p>假使，我們對於每一個兒童，只承認他是未來的成人，不承認兒童有他自己的人格。那麼，要談兒童美術，便把傳統的技術訓練和它聯結起來。因之，特異的，創造的兒童美術，便不會在兒童的天國中發現了。</p>
<p>一個優良的兒童美術敎育家，應該要從「讓兒童生長，發育和成熟。」的計劃之下，進行敎育，這就承認了兒童的人格，更承認了兒童的美術。</p>
<p>依着這樣的理想而終身從事於兒童美術敎育的，在現代世界敎育園地裏，佛萊斯。薛石克（Franz　Cizek　1865－）是値得被我們注意的一個人。</p>
<p>薛石克是奧國人，生於波希米亞城易北河上的Leitmeritz地方，自十九歲起，即移居於維也納。他在Peitmeritz畢業以後，一八八五年進維也納美術專門學校攻讀，寄宿在一個木匠的家裏，那兒常有許多兒童和他來接觸，並要求他描畫和着色，薛石克不但答應他們的要求，而且還供給他們不少的紙筆和顏料，他發現了兒童繪畫的特異而驚奇起來，他便向兒童美術的研究與敎育許下了一個堅定的心願。</p>
<p>他發現兒童美術，是沒有成人一般的計劃，可是那種椎拙的形式，確回到了中國古埃及和巴比侖，以及黑人的美術形式上去，這不特是美術敎育上的新發現，簡直是現代藝術的新生命。</p>
<p>薛石克所慣用的敎學方法，是供給豐富的參考與欣賞品，以及物質材料，當兒童在自己製作的過程上發生了困難來求敎他，他也只是給予鼓勵，指點和暗示，絕對不去動手修改或代作。因爲他是第一個人堅決主張美術敎學應以兒童的創作能量爲基礎。所以，他不但是一個兒童美術敎育的改造者，而且也是一個獨創者。</p>
<h3>勞美敎育的實施</h3>
<p>— 金啓靜</p>
<p>勞美敎育是整個民族文化的問題，決不是單純的敎學工具。所謂勞作與美術的範圍，也決不是手工和圖畫而已。牠的意義和本質是廣泛的，多方面的，是有機體的活敎育；尤其在我們向來着重哲學思想的東方民族，更顯得重要而迫切！</p>
<p>大家知道兒童的勞作成績，並不一定眞的派牠應用，也不是像職業學校般地製成實用器皿，目的是要勞動兒童的筋骨，利用兒童好動的天性，因勢利導去練習勤勞，啓發思想；正和兒童美術的目的不在造就畫家，只要順應愛美天性，訓練兒童欣賞表現，創造的興趣一樣。因此技巧上儘可忽略，不必拘束兒意的自由思想，而敎學上的方法，不可不加以縝密的研討。</p>
<p>勞美敎育的目的，旣不在乎專業訓練，所以，一切的敎學設備，儘管可以簡陋，不論在鄕村在城市，都可以因陋就簡，廣大的田野，狹窄的城市，都是實施勞美的地方，而且；兒童對於別的智識學科，也許要施以感應的方法，惟有勞動愛美是兒童特有的天性，引導兒童做勞美是等於放他們去野玩一樣的自動。問題只在乎怎樣去指導他們，協助他們？譬如說：兒童美術不該臨摹的，但是，我們該有理想的京西給小朋友參考。假定我們實施美術的時候，恰是廢曆新年，地方是偏僻的小城市，那末，燃鞭砲，戲紙龍一類事情，小朋友便是主角，我們利用了這種題材去要他們創作，一定有良好的收穫。</p>
<p>總之，勞美敎學的實施，決不能和生活與環境脫節，這是唯一的重要點。</p>
<h3>對於勞美成績展覽的希望</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>本市敎育局主辦的全市兒童勞美成績展覽會，經過了幾個月的籌備，並且在各區分別舉行預展，由各專家分別複選之後，昨天在五區第一，第二兩中心校，通惠小學及三區中心校四處同時舉行正式展覽三天；全部作品二萬餘件，眞可說是洋洋大觀，這是全市四十萬小學生智慧表現的代表作，也是全市一千餘勞美敎師的苦心指導的結品品，在這樣一個盛大的展覽，在我們向來從事藝術敎育的同人心目中，無疑地是一椿極感興趣的事情。</p>
<p>我們藝術敎育的同志們，在戰前就有過一個推廣藝術敎育的機構，—中華藝述敎育社。對於推廣藝術敎育的活動，曾經聯合市敎育局，兒童幸福會等舉辦了全國性的兒童繪畫展覽會，在設計方面，技術方面，藝敎社是盡了相當的努力。當時，各省市多有作品參加，各省市的勞美敎師遠道來參觀者爲數極多，所給予敎育行政當局，學校當局，藝術敎師等各方面的印象，相當深切而美滿，滿擬以後，逐年舉行，不幸抗戰發生，此項計劃遂致停頓。</p>
<p>勝利之後，藝敎社雖吿復員，但是格於經費人事，沒有一些成績做出來，十分抱歉！同時也非常着急！我們常常想做些可以做的事。因此；趁敎育局主辦勞美展的機會，我們商請申毅春秋主編，王進珊先生來發行一次勞美展的特輯，請幾位專家寫些文章，來闡揚勞美敎育的意義，使得大家注意一下。同時，也表示慶祝這兒童勞美展的成功。</p>
<p>這次勞美展的籌備工作，乃至於複選工作，審査評判等藝敎社也有很多同人參與的。也曾貢獻了我們的精神和力量，而對於敎育行政當局這一種極有意義的指施，我們更當代表藝術敎育界全體同人，敬致其誠摯的感謝！</p>
<p>勞美敎育在整個敎育上，有牠重大而深切的意義，在今天本刋各篇，已經說得很詳盡了，我們對於幣美展的希望是：從今以後，各校當局對於勞美敎育要經常的注意，至少限度保持籌備參加展覽會時候的態度。因為我們知道本學期各校當局為了參加勞美展而特地物色很有經騐的勞美敎師，費了很大的經費，臨時充實勞美方面的敎學設備。這是很好的現象，我們只希望大家經常的注意下去，經過較長時間之後，勞美敎育的效果，自然會得表現出來的。</p>
<p>再希望兒童家長們，參觀了你們子弟的勞美成績之後，應該放棄過去那種只重視智識科而輕視技能科的態度；應該轉變眼光，認識勞美科是手腦並用，順應兒童天性的最良好的敎學工具，不再阻止兒童的勞美活動。然後，勞美敎育在學校認眞，家庭重視的情形之下，可以順利發展了！</p>
<p>再希望我們勞美敎師們，重視我們自己的所負的使命，我們要如何設計敎學兒意的勞美敎育？我們如何使兒童在勞美作業中獲得豐富而美滿的生活經驗？如何帮助兒童表達他自己的思想和能力？然後我們可以實現勞美敎育的眞實意義。</p>
<h3>戲龍　（勞美成績之一）</h3>
<p>— 陳國雄　十一歲</p>
<h3>勞美敎育的創造性</h3>
<p>— 宗亮寰</p>
<p>這次上海市敎育局舉辦全市小學勞美成績展覽會，在籌備會和複選委員會中，規定了六項選材標準，就是：</p>
<p>（一）創造性　（二）眞實性　（三）地方性　（四）生產意味　（五）科學意味　（六）敎育意味其中最關重要的是「創造性」。</p>
<p>爲什麽要以「創造性」爲最重要呢？因爲我們要實施兒童本位的敎育和生活敎育。我們要讓兒童獲得豐富的生活經騐，並且儘量表現自己的思想和能力；同時不是把敎師支配好了的材料，呌兒童如法泡製一下，使成人看得滿意，就算完成任務。</p>
<p>勞美科中的發表，也和作文一樣，可以讓兒童充分表達自己的主見。而且必須常常這樣敎育兒意，纔會達到最高的領域。一篇好的作文，必須由作者自己表白他的觀感才有價値；如果全部由抄襲得來，那麽，即使文字非常生動，也是不足爲奇的。勞美科的成績也是這樣，以不抄襲他人的作品爲最有意味。</p>
<p>我們看了這次展覽會預展的成績，能够注意到「創造性」的學校，固然不少，可是大多數還是採用臨摹或仿作的舊法，—有一部份假的成績，更是要不得！尤其是美術，十分之七八是臨摹，而且內容大都以成人爲本位，並不適合兒童的需要，因此被淘汰的成績，至少有半數以上。</p>
<p>也許有人要間：「創造，不是輕易的事情，兒童怎麽做得到呢？」不錯！嚴格的創造，誠然不容易。不過我們所講的創造，並不是科學家或發明家所說的創造。我們是指「敎育作用」而言的。杜威氏以敎育爲「經騐的繼續不斷的改組」，所謂改組，就是敎育上的創造；柏格森以爲「一切生活，時刻在轉變之中，決不保守同一狀態，同一形式」。所謂轉變。也是敎育上的創造。我們依據或利用舊有的經騐，來做成一件新的東西，這件東西不是抄襲得來的，就呌做創造。</p>
<p>創造究竟有多大價値呢？試舉幾個例子來說明：</p>
<p>甲乙兩兒，各畫一幅風景畫。甲兒是完全照着範本畫成的，構圖，色調，和範本不相上下，成績當然算好的；乙兒是寫生某處的風景，構圖，色調，只是兒童的直覺的描寫，技巧並不圓熱，他的成績，當然遠不及甲兒的出色。但是我們用敎育的眼光來看：甲兒只是對着範本刻意模仿，他的心意活動是狹隘的，被動的，無生氣的；乙兒要對着實際的景物描寫，他的心意活動是廣泛的，自動的有生氣的；它的價値，當然要比模仿高得多。就從技巧方面來講，甲兒習於平面的摹寫，觀察能力和表現能力一定不及一兒容易進步，所以結果一定是落後的。</p>
<p>又如甲乙兩兒各做一個布枕套，甲兒是完全照着時行的式樣縫製的，所有花紋，配色等，都很調和美觀，成績當然算好的。乙兒呢，他只有幾種簡單的材料，他要計劃尺寸，設計裝飾圖案，研究最適合的縫製方面，處處要經過一番思考的工夫，才製作完成。他的成績，形式上雖不及甲兒完美，但是在敎育上的價値，却比甲兒高得多了！</p>
<p>從上面這兩個例子看來，可見施行創造性的敎育，並沒有什麽特殊的困難，只須敎者隨時設法較勵，隨時給予熱情的指導，不要强迫兒童做成人本位的成績就行。</p>
<p>勞美敎育應該重視「創造性」，不僅是敎育本身有其必然的理由；就是社會方面，也是很切要的。我國一切事業，都不容易進步；「墨守陳法」的積習，非常深錮。尤其是工藝製造品，總少獨創的風格，所以無法與先進國家競爭。我們要下一代勞動者富有創作的志願和知能，對於「創造性」的敎育是不容忽視的！</p>

<h3>訪梅蘭芳　（二）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>我的看戲的愛好，還是流亡後在四川開始的。有一時我旅居涪陵，當地有一平劇院，近在咫尺。我旅居無事，同了我的幼女一吟，每夜去看。起初，對于紅袍進，綠袍出，不感興味。後來漸漸覺得，這種扮法與演法，與其音樂的作曲法同出一軌，都是誇張的，象徵的表現。例如紅面孔一定是好人；白而孔一定是壞人；花面孔一定是武人；旦角的走路像走繩索；凈角的走路像拔泥脚……凡此種種扮演法，都是根據事實加以極度的誇張而來的。蓋善良正直的人，臉色光明威嚴，不妨誇張爲紅；奸邪暴戾的人，臉色冷酷陰慘，不妨誇張爲白；好勇鬥狠的人，其臉孔崢嶸突厄，不妨誇張爲花。窈窕的女人的走相，可以誇張爲一演線。堂堂的男子的踏大步，可以誇張得像拔泥足。……因爲都是根據寫實的，所以初看覺得奇怪，後來自會覺得當然。至於騎馬只要拿一根鞭子，開門只要裝一個手勢等，旣免嚕　繁冗之弊，又可給觀者以想像的餘地。我覺得這比寫實的明快得多。</p>
<p>從此，我變成了平劇的愛好者；但不是戲迷，不過歡喜聽聽看看而已。戲迷的倒是我的女孩子們。我的長女陳寳，三女寗馨，幼女一吟，公餘課畢，都熟中於唱戲。就中一吟迷得最深，竟在學校遊藝會中屢次上台扮演靑衣，儼然變成了一個票友。因此我家中平劇的空氣很濃。復員的時候，我們把這種空氣常作行李之一，從四川帶回上海。到得上海，適逢蔣主席六十誕晨。梅蘭芳演劇祝壽。我們買了三萬元一張的戲票，到天蟾舞台去看。抗戰前我只看過他一次，那時我不愛京戲，印象早已糢糊。抗戰中，我得知他在上海淪陷區堅貞不屈，孤芳自賞；又有友人寄到他的留鬚的照片。我本來仰慕他的技術，至此又贊佩他的人格，就把照片縣之齊壁。遙祝他的健康。那時勝利還渺茫，我對着照片想：無當迅速，人壽幾何，不知梅郞有否重上氍毺之日，我生有否重來聽賞之福！故我坐在天蟾舞台的包廂裘，看到梅蘭芳在龍鳳呈祥中以孫夫人之姿態出塲的時候，連忙俯仰顧盼，自拊其背，檢騐是否做夢，弄得鄰座的朋友莫明其妙，怪問「你不歡喜看梅蘭芳的」？後來他到中國大戲院續演，我跟去看，一連看了五夜。他演畢之後，我就去訪問他。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>堅忍的帝國</h3>
<p>— 報童</p>
<p>在此時此地，當我讀本報特派員毛樹淸倫敦通訊後，我似乎看到一個老大的國家在怎樣與歷史競賽，我也似乎看到高貴的紳士在怎樣與傳統鬥爭。尤其當我們這個艱困的社會中，豪餐與飢餓並陳，奢華與貧窮同在之時，我們從記者先生的新聞眼下知道了另一個古老的國家的動人的畫面，實在是旣佩且愧的。</p>
<p>爲了節省外匯，可以將香姻，烟葉，照相材料和電影認爲奢侈品，爲了一粥一飯來處不易，在最高菜的飯店中，無論你在英格蘭銀行有多少存款，在愛爾蘭有多少花國，你要了麵包，就不能兼得甜品。因此紳士們就得面對現實，壓縮他們的生活，就得認淸責任，與烟癮，與傳統，與一切古老的回憶與歷史作一次嚴肅的搏鬥與淸算。</p>
<p>這是爲什麽，每一個英國人都知道其意義。平衡外匯，節約生活，來加速「大英帝國」的新生。今的受苦，可以換來未來幸福，這自然十分得計。所以紳士們甘心情願這樣耐住性子過着日子，唯自求多福，不願再作求諸外援。啃人家的骨頭的打算，而工黨政府無財政赤字的三十一萬萬巨額預算，也終於成爲對保守黨攻擊的最好的答覆。</p>
<p>這一種堅忍果敢的毅力，實在是給我們一個最好的啓示，無論怎樣，我們的社會比諸英國動盪不安者不知凡幾，但是國際飯店頂上四字並不是我們社會的靈魂。千百家影院在全國映着金元換來的片子，祇要你有有金錢，你可以運用你揮霍的天才，儘情享受，豈止麵包兼甜品而已。我們的社會裏有幾人像倫敦老婦人那樣敢于責備貴國留學生食麵包而剝去硬皮呢？</p>
<p>「先生，你們中國糧食，一定很豐富吧！」這句倫敦婦人的話不是祗對那位留學生說的，而是對全中國的人們。如果克里浦斯夫人聞知，當要怪前之熱烈捐募援華爲多事了。想想，在豪奢與貧困並陳之中，我們又爲國家的將來打算了多少？</p>
<h3>無事忙</h3>
<p>— 滸</p>
<p>一個阿利桑那州的人從紐約回來，他所給與紐約人的批評是：從不鬆散一下，老是無事忙。然後，他舉了　個例來證明。他說：「有一個傢伙從地下火車中走出來，猛力地推着我好像有警察在追他的樣子，他衝過月台，三步一跳地走階級，我以爲他有什麽大事情，便跟在他後面；他奔着在紅燈時穿過馬絡，衝進一個公園。一下子倒在長椅上，很快地又起了腿，你知道他做什麽？—他開始讀報」！</p>
<h3>曲入冥</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>放火自殺</p>
<p>—見六月一日本市新聞</p>
<p>自殺本平常，自殺無妨，自家情願見閻王！怎害人家還放火？忒煞荒唐！</p>
<p>世紀病瘋狂，百事乖張，儘多笨伯玩偕亡，自殺殺人求痛快，好狠心腸！</p>
<h3>厲王流彘—讀史雜記之五</h3>
<p>— 蕭黛</p>
<p>周民族自從武王發克商以後，部落的戰爭暫吿終結。在這一個安定的局面下，周以殷商爲鑑，努力從事於農業的生產與工商業的發展；優越的經濟情形使周足族渡過了百二十年的黄金時</p>
<p>自昭王瑕接位以後，周人的統治地位開始呈現了動搖的徵象。據說昭王瑕渡漢水南巡之時，船夫因懨惡他而將他載在膠船中，渡至中流，膠溶船解，昭王就此送了命。這一舉動，多少帶有些襲學意味的，這以後平王因抵抗不往西方犬戎的壓迫而東遜洛邑，也是政權動搖的明徵。</p>
<p>分晰其所以如此變動的原因，乃由於西周以來新經濟的發達所致。經濟發達，（一）使上級貴族的生活腐化，而完全喪失其統治力量；（二）使各封國之間的交換關係密切，遂致引起各國彼此征伐；（三）使地主商人的地位逐漸抬高，終於壓倒貴族，而佔社會上的主要地位。這危機一直潛伏着，到厲王胡的時候，並加尖銳化了。厲王並沒有看淸楚自己的統治勢力已經削弱到了極點，西方的奏與南方的楚等諸候之國的勢力，却正在逐漸强大而威脅着他；他也從未考慮到用什麼方法，去挽救這個迫近眉睫的危難，好好地承襲這一份祖業；相反地因爲生活的奢侈淫佚，而重用了一位好專利而不知大難的榮夷公爲卿士，專門從事於剝削人民的工作。在當時，優越的經濟情形腐蝕了周之貴族，而一般小民，則被壓在十八層地獄里，其痛苦自可想見，厲王非但不設法拯民於水火，反借了榮夷公的手去壓榨人民，於是民怨沸騰了。</p>
<p>國語周語上有着這樣一叚記戰：</p>
<p>「厲王虐，國人謗王。邵公曰：「民不堪命矣」！王怒，得衛巫使監謗者；以吿，則殺之。國人莫敢言，道路以目。王喜，吿邵公日：「吾能弭謗矣，乃不敢言」。邵公曰：「是障之也。防民之口甚於防川。川壅而潰，傷人必多，民亦如之。是故爲川者決之使導，爲民者宣之使言…民之有口，猶土之有山川也，財用於是乎出。猶原濕之有衍沃也，衣食於是乎生。口之宣也，善敗於是乎興。行善而備敗，其所以阜財用衣食者也。夫民慮之於心，而宣之於口，成而行之，胡可壅也？若壅其口，其與能幾何」？王不聽，於是國人莫敢出言。三年，乃流王於彘」。</p>
<p>邵公的這番話很透澈，而且含有至深的哲理，但是沒有被厲王採納。厲王動手把謗王的人殺掉幾個，不再聽到謗王之聲，就以爲天下太平了，那樣自得其樂地說「吾能弭謗矣」，那里知道不出三年，就給人民放逐於彘了。</p>
<h3>循環</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>因爲市面的不景氣，所以工廠和商店，便紛紛倒閉，緊縮，裁員，减薪。</p>
<p>因爲裁員，减薪，所以一般生活，就感到更加艱難。</p>
<p>因爲生活愈感艱難，購買力就更加薄弱。</p>
<p>因爲購買力愈薄弱，市面不景氣就更深刻化了。</p>
<h3>注意日本</h3>
<p>— 珂珮</p>
<p>這不是噩夢，且看四日各報的電訊：</p>
<p>「日本希望與美國共同託管琉球羣島，並在千島列島及庫頁島附近取得漁權，及在台灣取得特別移民權」。</p>
<p>無可諱言，由於勝利後盟國之間的相互猜忌，戰敗國的日本早又應遝而起了，這在緊隣着日本的我國，能不寒心！</p>
<p>戰爭結束不過才兩年，但是兩年來的變化太大了，戰敗國的日本又成爲逮東的經濟總樞，回顧四强之一的中國，由於勝利後的長期戰亂，破壞的不能建設，建設的又遭破壞，早已弄得面目全非。</p>
<p>據最近來自日本的朋友說：「日本人的進取心很强，戰爭的破壞千百倍于中國，但是今日的日本已走向生產之路了」。許多人爲日本的復興害怕，我們覺得戰後的日本復興是需要的，正像病後的人需要休息一樣。這一點我是同意於謝冰心先生的說法的。</p>
<p>雖然這樣，我們並不能忘懷於這次殘酷的恥辱，第一次大戰後的德國就是前車之鑑，那種逾越範圍的各種權益，如台灣之移民權，琉球之託管，我們必須予以取消。</p>
<p>總之，怕日本復興是不必的，同時也沒有用的，管制，限制都不過是枝節的辦法，根本的辦法，還是來復興自己，只有靠自己的實力，才能解除人家對我們的威脅。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>平日始終能够維持超人一般的鎭定的蘭的臉色，也變得更蒼白了，但她並沒有說話，眼睛依然緊閉。</p>
<p>「別慌，闌，我會扶你上車的！」情感受着極大衝動的祝兆年禁不住俯下身子去，悄悄地這樣說。</p>
<p>蘭急急搖頭。</p>
<p>祝兆年　得她是怕自己這麽一攙扶，就有傳染的可能，但這時候怎能顧得這許多呢？</p>
<p>「可是，我們也不能勞動別人哪！」他嘻笑着說：「並且我的體格很强，向來是百病不侵的。」說着，立刻就灣下身子，伸開兩臂，輕輕地從那籐椅上把蘭速氈子一起抱了起來。</p>
<p>車上有好幾個熟心的人瞧了這情形都自動擠緊起來，讓出尺許寬，兩三尺長的一條空隙，使老祝正好可以把蘭平放在許多行李捲和箱籠的上面。這樣半倚半躺的至少總比坐着省力得多了。張昌漲紅着臉，分頭向各人道謝。</p>
<p>二三十碼路外傳來了緋緋的大哭大鬧的聲音，聽在蘭和老祝的耳朶裏，更是特雖的淸楚。</p>
<p>「呌她來！」蘭睜眼看了老祝一者，很費力地迸出了這三個字。</p>
<p>祝兆年却認爲這時侯實在沒有讓緋緋來和她媽作別的必要，因爲這樣未免徒亂人意，</p>
<p>「就要開車了，我看還是別呌她來的好。。」他很溫婉地說。</p>
<p>「不……，」蘭的臉上透出了焦急的神氣，「這……這孩子……性…急……急得很，……哭急了……會……會暈過去………去的。」</p>
<p>這倒是祝兆年所始料不及的，他慌得來不及的轉過身子，衝出人　去。然而已經太遲了，待他找到緋緋，這個小女孩子已經哭得暈死在那帶領她的女團員的身上，兩三個人急得熟汗直流地在施行急救法。</p>
<p>「快！快！冷手巾！冷手巾！」老祝忘命似的推着另外一個團員，呌他快奔回小茶館去弄冷手巾來，一面急急解開緋緋身上的衣服，把她平放在地上，　自給她使用人工呼吸法。</p>

<h3>US President to Issue Statement Reaffirming Economic Aid to China Policy, Marshall Advocates Early Loans to Our Country</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 6th Radio: United Press Special Correspondent Hans Wright: President Truman will, within the next few weeks, reaffirm the policy towards China, the content of which is related to clearing up the uncertainties about opening up loans to China. At the same time, Marshall also advocated early loans to China. The original text of the correspondent's Washington telegram is as follows: According to well-informed sources who told the United Press here: "Chairman Chiang's 'expansion' of government work has achieved some success, therefore, it has removed obstacles in opening up the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan. In view of this, President Truman is very likely to reaffirm his policy towards China within a few weeks, and it is heard that Secretary of State Marshall strongly agrees with this matter. Secretary Marshall believes that it is a good strategy to provide assistance to the Chinese National Government as soon as possible. In addition, Secretary Marshall is also convinced that there is no chance this year to obtain substantial assistance for China from Congress. According to the amount that the Export-Import Bank has already allocated to lend to China, it does not require congressional approval, but its validity period is June 30."</p>
<p>It is also learned that officials in recent days have received reports from Chinese Northeast diplomatic personnel stating that the Communist army's combat strength in that area has greatly increased, so the concern for the Chinese situation in general has been intensified because of this.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 6th Radio: US officials declared that before the US side reaffirms its policy towards China, China will temporarily not submit to the US side a plan regarding the use of the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan. According to officials of the bank, China has not yet submitted a plan for the use of the funds, as it is waiting for President Truman's reaffirmation of the policy. It is reported that in the past two weeks, China has prepared the plan, but it will not be submitted until the US policy statement is issued. It is learned that President Truman will exert pressure on the Export-Import Bank to urge it to extend the validity period of the loan, and adopt a lenient policy on the China plan. Regarding the loan, Marshall's views differ significantly from those of the Export-Import Bank. Mr. Marshall observes the matter from the perspective of broad international politics, believing that it is necessary to provide economic and psychological assistance to China as soon as possible, but the viewpoint of the Export-Import Bank is the opposite. Their viewpoint is a narrow commercial perspective. President Truman is now testing public reaction with the military aid to Argentina, and if this reaction is good, then his plan to aid the National Government will be smoothly implemented.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency London, 5th] British Far East expert Green stated today: Although China is currently in turbulent waters, it still has great hope in the future. Mr. Green published a lengthy article in the June issue of the political magazine bi-monthly, in which he made a very insightful analysis of China's current problems. Mr. Green also listed the bright and promising factors of our country, and asked the British people to remember that China has experienced fourteen years of war when judging and evaluating the Chinese situation, and its disasters are worse than those of any other country. Mr. Green continued: China can also place great hope in Chairman Chiang's leadership, which has clearly been able to adapt to the needs of the times. The stern military man of twenty years ago has today become a statesman with a broad vision. His goals are unquestionable, just like his lofty prestige. With the support of Chairman Chiang, enlightening new opinions have been established. China still has to face a perilous road and many frustrating things, but its destination is indeed a bright future.</p>
<h3>US Military Advisory Group Helps Us Establish a New Army, Major General Rooks Reports Details</h3>
<p>[Reuters Nanjing, 6th] Major General Rooks hosted reporters today, revealing for the first time the mission of the US Military Advisory Group in China, including assisting in the reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense and military schools, establishing four military training schools, and preparing a long-term plan to improve the effectiveness and education standards of the Chinese army. Major General Rooks strongly stated that since the establishment of the US Military Advisory Group a year ago, it has never provided assistance to or had any relationship with the troops participating in the Chinese war, and has only been engaged in the initial preparation of assisting in the establishment of training and reform plans. This plan will take ten to fifteen years to complete, and its success still depends on the end of the civil war. According to the long-term plan proposed by the Military Advisory Group, people from all departments in China should serve in the military. Before formally enlisting, they must receive military and civic education training so that the trainees can understand the situation in China and common sense of the constitution. In order to assist in carrying out this plan, the US Military Advisory Group has dispatched a total of 750 officers and soldiers stationed in China. In addition, there is also the US Naval Advisory Group of about 300 people. Major General Rooks also said that the US Military Advisory Group has assisted in the reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense. In addition, the reorganized military schools have been mostly established, and their system roughly imitates the West Point Military Academy in the United States. The US Military Advisory Group also assisted in the organization of a staff school and a national defense university. In addition, four schools for training instructors have been established, and there is also an infantry school in the Nanjing area. The US Military Advisory Group will train the Chinese army as soon as possible, but this work cannot be started during the civil war. The plan is to train an infantry division first, and then use it as the core to train other troops. As for the air force training schools, branches have been established in Chengdu, Hangzhou, Hankou, Shanghai and other places. In addition, there is an artillery school in Nanjing and an armored unit school in Xuzhou. Recently, 120 students have graduated from the armored unit school.</p>
<h3>No Combat Training Provided to Avoid Getting Involved in the Vortex of Internal Strife</h3>
<p>According to another United Press report, some courses have been added to the training plan in Chengdu, most of which are used to train air force officers. Therefore, after the officers graduate, in addition to being awarded military positions, they are also awarded bachelor's degrees. The current plan is to immediately train an infantry division as part of a large-scale plan for China to have a modern army equal to other countries. However, he pointed out that the advisory group is currently not allowed to provide combat training because the United States does not want to get involved in China's civil war. The current plan excludes training related to combat. The training of land forces has nothing to do with actual military operations. On the other hand, personnel from the air force advisory group are also not allowed to participate in actual combat, but only serve as technicians and instructors for training, as well as maintenance training for equipment and facilities. In the past year, the advisory group has moved several schools to the rear far from the combat zone. At the same time, Marshall also ordered the air force training group in Beiping to move elsewhere to avoid people attacking the US for participating in or helping the Chinese government fight the civil war.</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Asks for Sick Leave, Chairman Approves by Telegram</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch] Government member Mo Dehui has been ill in Zhongshan Hospital since returning to Shanghai from Taiwan. It has been a week and he has not recovered.

The telegram stated: "Mr. Mo Liuchen, Member of the Zhongshan Hospital, both the letter and telegram have been received. The journey encountered storms, which affected your health. I am very concerned. I hope you can rest in peace and recuperate, and I hope you will recover soon. Zhongzheng has already affixed the seal of the Jiangfu." It is also learned that Mrs. Mo and her beloved daughter hurried to Shanghai to visit Mr. Mo after learning of his illness in Beiping, and arrived three days later.</p>

<h3>Kaiyuan and Wulajie Recaptured, Du Yuming Says Situation Can Be Changed, Old Troops of Ma Zhanshan Rise Up Against Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changchun, 6th] A certain unit of the National Army captured Wulajie, north of Jilin, at five o'clock in the morning. Most of the Communist army in northern Jilin transferred to Jiangmifeng, near Jidong. In addition, the Xiyangguo Station on the Jihai Line was captured by the Communist army yesterday. Wulajie was lost on the 19th of last month when our army strategically withdrew, and it has been 18 days since then.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 6th] Military News: (1) The area surrounding Changchun has been calm for several days. (2) A certain unit of the National Army in Jilin has been searching in the Jiangdong area for several days, giving the Communist army attempting to stir up trouble a great blow. At about 4:00 AM on the 5th, the National Army recaptured Wulajie. Wulajie is an important town on the edge of the Jiang River in northeastern Jilin. The Communist army originally stationed in the area was the 78th Regiment of the Independent 3rd Division, which was reorganized from the security team, with a part of the cavalry attached. Since the 3rd, it has been fleeing to Tiangang, and it has announced that it will join the Communist army that fled north from Panshi to attack Jilin. After the National Army recaptured Wulajie, the Communist army in the area fled in all directions. As of the 6th, there has been no major change in the war situation in eastern Jilin. (3) The mobile corps of the National Army recaptured Kaiyuan on the morning of the 5th and is now advancing north along the Changshen Line with two wings covering it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] Xiong Shihui, Ma Zhanshan, and others went to Du Yuming's official residence one after another on the morning of the 6th to discuss the war situation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] Zhao Jiaxiang broadcasted to the citizens on the current situation at the Shenyang Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th in his capacity as the commander of the garrison in order to avoid disturbing the police. Zhao said: Shenyang is only allowed to exist, and no mistakes are allowed.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] Du Yuming recovered from his leg illness and met with reporters for the first time on the 6th. Talking about the avoidance of the situation in Northeast China, he said: The Communist army tried to seize Changchun, Jilin, and Siping and continued to flee south without success. Now most of its forces are concentrated between Kaiyuan and Qingyuan, numbering about 100,000 people, attempting to take the opportunity to expand the chaos. The National Army's strategy has shown that it can evacuate empty and unimportant areas and implement concentration to greatly reduce the strength of the Communist army. A decisive battle may be launched in the near future, and the situation will be able to change. When asked about the feelings of people who hastily evacuated Shenyang, it was said that this was a blessing for Shenyang, because it can not only avoid the scourge of floating capital, but also make sense to spend money on escaping. In the short term, it will restrict those people from coming back again.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tieling, 5th] After the reporter arrived in Kaiyuan and stayed for half a day, he strategically retreated with the army to Tieling, ten kilometers to the south. Tieling is currently an important strategic stronghold north of Shenyang. The brave and good-fighting New Sixth Army is preparing to give the invading Communist army a annihilating blow. The people of the whole county are mobilized day and night to assist in the construction of city defenses. The impregnable fortifications have been completed in five days. The people of Tieling are at peace, and there is no atmosphere of war. Shops are open as usual, and prices have also fluctuated little.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] According to reports, the National Army in the Sanjiazi, Cangshi Nankou, and Qian Nanzamu areas north of Yingxi on the Shenhai Line has made a strategic retreat, and the train is open to Yingxi.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang, 6th] The war situation east of Putian Store and Xinglong Fort was fierce. The National Army moved north according to the planned plan at noon on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changchun, 6th] The National Army's sweeping troops approached Yitong County in the southeast of Changchun. The county was attacked by the Communist army for a week, and County Mayor Yi Zhuzhang led the security regiment and the police to fight hard alone. Finally, due to the disparity in strength, they retreated in the morning. It is also reported that the Communist army based in Huaide is currently retreating to Yangjiacheng to the west, and the National Army can fully control the area near Huaide.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] When the reporter asked Du Yuming about the matter that Ma Zhanshan's troops north of the Songhua River rose up against the Communist army, threatening Harbin, Du said: This is indeed the case in the Hulun area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Jilin, 7th] It is widely rumored here that Hulun and other places near Harbin have been occupied by the underground army, and its troops are the old troops of the anti-Japanese leader Xie Wendong (Xie was solved by Lin Biao after the liberation), but the military has not been able to confirm this news. However, according to people from that side, the rear of the Communist army is indeed extremely empty, and the momentum of the underground army is greatly strengthened. This statement is very likely.</p>
<h3>Zhang Guangzhong, Commander of the Communist Army in Southern Shandong, Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 6th] The remnants of Zhang Guangzhong's Southern Shandong Military Region were almost completely wiped out on the afternoon of the 5th. Zhang Guangzhong was injured in the head and is currently hiding in a cave with more than 100 people. They will all be resolved in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Pan Yukun Promoted to Major General</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Shenyang, 6th] Command News: Pan Yukun, the commander of the 50th Division who defended Dehui, has been ordered to be promoted to Major General of the Army.

<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 6th] It is widely rumored that the Portuguese government in Macau has announced martial law to prevent Chinese troops from entering at any time. The reporter specially interviewed the provincial government spokesman (Director of the News Department Xiao Weimin), who said that this statement is too early. The government has not made any preparations at present. Moreover, this matter can be resolved diplomatically, and it is believed that force will not be used. However, the recovery of Macau has become a unanimous request of the people of the whole country, and the people here are also paying considerable attention to this. According to visitors from Macau, the market there is quite chaotic, people are worried, business is sluggish, and Chinese newspapers have long been banned from import. It is also rumored that Macau has sent plainclothes personnel to sneak in to inquire about the actions of our authorities. People here said that if the actions of the Macau government are true, then such a nervous move is ridiculous.</p>

<h3>Public and Private Shipping Industry Freight Rates Approved for Independent Negotiation; Government Subsidies Discontinued from This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Shipping industry freight rates were approved for adjustment starting in June, as passed by the State Council meeting on the 6th. This measure includes both privately-owned and state-owned shipping businesses. Government subsidies for the industry will also cease from the same month. Going forward, freight rates will be determined independently by the industry. This proposal was put forward by Premier Zhang Qun, with the reasoning that: current freight rates were approved in December of last year, with subsidies implemented starting in March of this year. However, due to soaring prices, the current subsidy amount is less than one-tenth of the losses. The National Price Commission has already decided to allow the private sector to negotiate prices independently, so the state-owned sector should be treated similarly.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The five subgroups under the National Economic Commission will convene meetings within the week to thoroughly discuss issues such as military expenditure, financial and monetary policies, food, the sale of state-owned enterprises, and the general budget, in order to submit them to the Commission's third general meeting next Monday. Furthermore, the Economic Commission held a review meeting on the afternoon of the 6th to review the procedural rules.</p>

<h3>National Water Conservancy Conference Opens; Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang Issue Special Admonitions; Minister Xue Delivers Speech, Proposing Three Points</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The opening of the National Water Conservancy Conference and the memorial ceremony for the birth of Yu the Great were held at the Public Recreation Society at 9:00 AM on the 6th, presided over by Xue Dubi, Minister of Water Conservancy. Over a hundred representatives from various regions attended, including Chen Guofu, former member of the Water Conservancy Commission, Zhang Hanying, design committee member of the Central Design Bureau, and Shen Yi, Mayor of Nanjing. The venue was specially decorated, with charts and graphs of water conservancy designs and implementation progress hung throughout the hall. A large banner with the four characters "The Spirit of Yu the Great" was hung above the portrait of the Founding Father. A statue of Yu the Great was placed below the portrait of the Founding Father, making the venue resemble an exhibition hall. After the formal ceremonies, Minister Xue delivered the opening address, putting forward three points. Next, the admonition from Chairman Chiang of the National Government was respectfully read. Deputy Secretary Shen then read the admonition from Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. Subsequently, guests Chen Guofu, Zhang Hanying, Fu Rulin, and Shen Yi delivered speeches one after another. Finally, the Yu the Great memorial was sung, followed by a group photo and adjournment.</p>
<p>Minister Xue's opening address briefly stated: How to actively promote water conservancy nationwide in the future depends on close internal and external connections, unity from top to bottom, collective effort, and joint dedication to achieve success, in order to create a brilliant future for water conservancy. He hoped that this conference would complete three tasks: First, determine the priorities and urgency of water conservancy construction and the matters that should be developed and reformed; second, review the advantages and disadvantages of the implementation of the Water Law and prepare to revise other water conservancy laws; third, study the strategies for connecting and coordinating central and local water conservancy construction. In addition, Xue also hoped that the conference would conduct detailed discussions and formulate plans on the advancement of water conservancy science, the training of water conservancy talent, the fundraising of water conservancy funds, as well as related personnel and financial matters.</p>
<p>Chairman's Admonition: Encouraging Continued Efforts</p>
<p>The full text of Chairman Chiang's admonition is as follows: "China is an agricultural country, and since ancient times, the government and the people have attached great importance to water conservancy. Its rise and fall are sufficient to affect the governance of politics and the prosperity of the country. In modern times, with the rise of industry and commerce, water conservancy undertakings have been promoted daily, and its relationship to the national economy and people's livelihood is even more critical. The Founding Father personally drafted the industrial plan, which also included important instructions on this matter. Now, as the War of Resistance has been won and the country is being built, promoting water conservancy is the most important part of economic construction. Considering that water conservancy undertakings are arduous, simply put, they are nothing more than promoting benefits and eliminating harm. The majority of China's population are farmers, and what farmers need most in their actual lives today is drought and flood prevention, sufficient clothing and food. In recent years, domestic water conservancy projects, with historical experience and scientific methods, have been successfully completed, effectively promoting benefits and eliminating harm; for example, the previous dredging of the Huai River, the construction of water diversion channels and dams, and even the recent blocking of the Yellow River breach, are all remarkable achievements. However, many important water conservancy constructions have not yet begun, and the road ahead is long, not allowing a day of leisure. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will weigh the urgency and continue to focus on the repair and prevention of rivers and the irrigation of farmland, and further organize waterways and develop hydropower. In particular, engineering and administration must be closely linked, and the central and local authorities must cooperate fully, so that they can connect like arms and fingers, treating both the symptoms and the root causes. Water conservancy workers should continue to work hard, seeking to contribute, with the long-term goal of inheriting the legacy of Yu the Great in establishing the mountains and rivers, and the immediate goal of realizing the legacy of the Founding Father's industrial plan, so that the nation's prosperity and happiness can be achieved soon. Now, as the National Water Conservancy Conference opens, I offer these words for mutual encouragement. Zhongzheng, Chen, Shi."</p>
<p>Premier Zhang's Address: Pointing out Three Key Points</p>
<p>Premier Zhang was unable to attend due to attending a State Council meeting, so he sent a written admonition. He pointed out that to achieve food self-sufficiency, it is necessary to strive to develop water conservancy, and the capital for industrialization must be sought from agriculture. Zhang pointed out that there should be three key points for water conservancy in China today: (1) The purpose of water conservancy is to promote benefits and eliminate disasters. There must be a very practical and precise plan for how water conservancy should be carried out in a certain area and how water disasters should be eliminated in a certain area. (2) Water conservancy projects require a lot of funding. Now, after the war, the national treasury is tight. The domestic order has not yet been restored, and financial and material resources are very difficult. We must achieve the most results with the least amount of funding and the most simple materials. (3) The Ministry of Water Conservancy is a government agency, but water conservancy is not just a government undertaking. We must encourage private enterprise and utilize foreign investment to make China's water conservancy construction universal in terms of region and rapid in terms of time.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang encouraged everyone to "take the spirit of Yu the Great as their spirit and the cause of Yu the Great as their cause, so that China's water conservancy cause can rapidly promote agricultural prosperity and then seek to establish industry."</p>
<p>General Assembly Telegram: Paying Respects to the Chairman</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting was held after the opening ceremony. Chairman Xue Dubi decided to establish a secretariat and passed the review rules. Finally, Zhang Hanying made a temporary motion: In the name of the General Assembly, send a telegram to Chairman Chiang of the National Government to pay respects. The telegram was passed at the first General Assembly. The original telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: Your Excellency leads the War of Resistance and promotes constitutional government, your prestige has spread far and wide, laying the foundation of the country in safety and extending benefits to the people, all nations admire and the world respects. We are gathered in the capital to plan for major water conservancy projects, and we are deeply inspired by your instructions. We will respectfully abide by them and live up to your expectations. We pay our respects, hoping you will heed our words. The entire membership of the National Water Conservancy Conference respectfully bows."</p>
<p>The first General Assembly was held at 3:00 PM on the 6th, with 66 members in attendance. First, Xue Dubi announced the text of the telegram to Chairman Chiang, and then the entire body stood in silence to mourn water conservancy expert Li Yizhi.

According to what Mr. Liu told the reporter: After the provincial government received the charge from the Supervisory Envoy Office, it has suspended Tian Mengjia from his duties for investigation. If evidence of embezzlement is found in the future, he will naturally be punished by law. Even if no evidence is found, he does not intend to reinstate him, because he is a relative of mine. For the sake of the overall situation in Henan, I have to sacrifice him. Mr. Liu also said: I am willing to sincerely accept the accusations from all parties, and I am unwilling to make any defenses or explanations for the misunderstandings, and I do not want to plan any countermeasures.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hopes for Future Water Conservancy Construction</h3>
<p>The National Water Conservancy Conference was held yesterday, on Engineers' Day, in Nanjing, with the meeting scheduled to last for six days. This is the first national water conservancy conference since the establishment of the Ministry of Water Conservancy. In addition to the heads of the various departments, many water conservancy engineering experts are also attending. The theme of this session is the review of current water conservancy work, the planning of post-war water conservancy construction, the connection and cooperation of central and local water conservancy undertakings, and other related water conservancy matters. We are deeply aware of the importance of post-war water conservancy undertakings and have unlimited expectations for the convening of this water conservancy conference.</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, and since ancient times, the government and the people have attached great importance to farmland water conservancy and river defense projects. Historically, the rise and fall of water conservancy have been closely related to the governance of politics and the prosperity of the country. During the Han Dynasty, Jia Rang strongly advocated that dredging rivers and canals has three benefits and not doing so has three harms. Therefore, his three strategies for river management have been regarded as the standard by river officials of all dynasties. During the Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi vigorously promoted farmland water conservancy when he was in power and reforming the law, which was very active. Later, Gu Tinglin said that the way to govern the country and benefit the people is to strongly advocate the construction of rivers and canals, which can "return the hearts of the people all over the world and make them prioritize righteousness before profit" as the top priority of governance. It is sufficient to say that the harm to the country is the lack of water conservancy; and the benefit to the country lies in dredging rivers and canals, benefiting the people, and blessing the country. With the advancement of modern science, natural forces have become publicly available resources; the TVA water conservancy project in Tennessee is the most valuable resource for the American national economy, and the supply of industrial power is endless. China is building a nation based on agriculture and industry. The need for modern water conservancy construction is not only to prevent floods passively, but also to facilitate irrigation actively and develop industrial power. This is of great importance to the future of the national economy. After the victory and restoration, the successful blocking of the Yellow River Huayuankou is considered a major construction project completed by the government; however, the closure of the Yellow River breach is a passive and unfavorable construction. Its active water conservancy construction relies on the efforts of the newly established Ministry of Water Conservancy and the concentrated wisdom of water conservancy engineering experts across the country. Here are some important water conservancy works, roughly listed for reference by the water conservancy authorities and water conservancy engineering experts attending the meeting.</p>
<p>First, the Yellow River has breached its banks for the past ten years, flooding more than four provinces. On March 15 of this year, the river was closed, and the people in the vast flood zone celebrated together. The government has rewarded the meritorious service of the river workers. People across the country are paying close attention to this great project. Although the flood in the flood zone has passed, there are still many outstanding issues, such as the water conservancy projects related to the Jialu River, Ying River, Fei River, Wo River, and Hui River, all of which have been silted up by mud and sand due to the flooding of the Yellow River. The old river channels have disappeared. In the future, it will be necessary to engage in well sinking, reservoir storage, and opening of river channels in the flood zone. Although the progress of this project is not as urgent as waiting for food for refugees, if it cannot be properly handled, it will cause nine million mu of fertile land in the flood zone to become a desolate desert after the year. However, this project requires a lot of funding, and it is questionable whether it can be done one by one given the current financial situation. It is hoped that the water conservancy authorities and experts can have meticulous plans.</p>
<p>Second, the Yangtze River is the lifeline of China. Today, to promote water conservancy on the Yangtze River, it is necessary to regulate Dongting Lake. Hunan has always been a rice-producing area, and the richest source of rice lies in the fertile land along Dongting Lake. In recent years, the soil in Dongting has been silted up. Every year, the water rises in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the water flowing into Dongting Lake from Hunan cannot be accommodated, resulting in floods. It is said that the bottom of Dongting Lake has been silted up into a vast mudflat, which is not conducive to the discharge of river water, resulting in a dispute over the so-called digging up of "Tianyou Weir". Now, the water conservancy authorities have established the Dongting Lake Engineering Office, sent engineering personnel to Hunan, and allocated special funds to manage Dongting. If this project can be realized, its value will be second only to the closure of the Yellow River. It is hoped that the water conservancy authorities will proceed quickly and cooperate effectively with the people of Hunan and Hubei to manage Dongting; and it is hoped that the construction of levees will be expanded, and that they will cooperate with local governments to design the opening and closing of levee highways. If this is the case, the economic and transportation value of the future Dongting Lakeside will become more and more important, benefiting the provinces of Hunan and Hubei in no small way.</p>
<p>Third, the Yangtze River water conservancy project is mutually related to the Yichang Three Gorges water gate "Yang Yu An" YVA water conservancy project, also known as the "Savage Plan." This is the largest modern water conservancy construction, and the design has been completed for a long time. According to the original plan, mountains and rocks are excavated in Yichang to form tunnels; power plants are established in the tunnels, with a power generation capacity of 10 million kilowatts. In addition to supplying the area within a 300-mile radius of the water gate, high-voltage lines can connect Nanjing to the east, Chengdu to the west, Guiyang to the south, and Tianshui to the north. The number of people benefiting is more than the entire population of the United States. Not only will Yangtze River irrigation be improved, and the river water will be raised year-round to facilitate the navigation of large ships, but it will also help the industrial construction of the southwestern provinces, which is of great importance to the future of national construction. Now, the Executive Yuan, feeling that the national treasury is thin, considers the Yang Yu An water conservancy project to be a "non-urgent measure" and has decided to stop surveying the water volume project. If it is unfortunately abandoned halfway, this is a phenomenon of "rivers running down" and is very unwise. It is hoped that the water conservancy authorities and water conservancy engineering experts will strive to ensure that this project is not completely abandoned, even if the engineering personnel endure hardship and save money, they must gradually complete this unique modern water conservancy project to lay the foundation for the country's industrialization. At the same time, it is also hoped that the Executive Yuan authorities will carry out a construction project in the midst of the current turbulent situation to comfort the people, and must not stop halfway due to fear of choking. Entrepreneurship is inherently difficult and needs to be done in difficulty.</p>
<p>The above discussion is only about the larger water conservancy construction projects at present; as for the opening of small local water conservancy projects in various provinces, and technical cooperation with foreign countries, and the collection of water conservancy construction funds, etc., it is hoped that this meeting will have a practical plan, and in the future, the spirit of overcoming floods will be thoroughly implemented. The future of the construction of a new China is promising and bright.</p>
<h3>Practicing Public Office for Private Gain, Corruption, and Malpractice: Sheng Shicai Receives a Reprimand; The Commission on Disciplinary Action for Political Officials Issues a Resolution</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Sheng Shicai, former Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, was found to have practiced public office for private gain, engaged in corruption, and violated the law during his tenure. Following a complaint by the Dihua Uyghur General Association, the Control Yuan investigated and confirmed the evidence of his crimes. A proposal for impeachment was submitted, and the National Government transferred the case to the Commission on Disciplinary Action for Political Officials for review. The review has been completed, and it has been decided: Sheng Shicai will receive a reprimand. The full text of the resolution is as follows:</p>
<p>Ruling: Sheng Shicai receives a reprimand.</p>
<p>Facts: The Control Yuan received complaints from organizations such as the Xinjiang Dihua Uyghur General Association, accusing Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of the province, of practicing public office for private gain, engaging in corruption, and violating the law. The Control Yuan instructed the Xinjiang Control Commissioner's Office to investigate. The report stated that the Xinjiang Police Department originally operated the Yixin Soap Factory. Between 1938 and 1939, the factory purchased hundreds of thousands of catties of cotton. In the spring of 1943, Tie Kun, the factory's manager, was ordered to secretly engage in business for Sheng Shicai. He was instructed to devalue and embezzle over 400,000 catties of cotton from the factory's inventory, transport it to Gansu for sale, and use the proceeds to purchase a large quantity of sundry goods for transport to Dihua. In October 1944, these goods were resold for 8,465,000 New Currency. In September of the same year, before Sheng Shicai was transferred internally, Tie Kun took the funds, totaling over 70 million Legal Currency (including funds from other businesses), to Lanzhou and deposited them in the Overseas Chinese Bank to establish a factory. In the winter of the same year, the former Director of the Police Department, Li Yingqi, and others telegraphed the central government, requesting that these 70 million plus Legal Currency be allocated to aid the Northeastern refugees who had suffered in Xinjiang. After receiving this information, Sheng Shicai also submitted a report, claiming that the deposit was a special fund provided by the central government for him to maintain special operations. He then ordered Tie Kun to manage the business on his behalf. Subsequently, Tie Kun made multiple deliveries of the funds and published a statement to explain the process and absolve himself of responsibility. After review, Control Commissioner Wang Shu concluded that Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of Xinjiang Province, had practiced public office for private gain, engaged in corruption, and sought personal profit, which was a violation of the law. He proposed impeachment and requested disciplinary action. Control Commissioners Zhang Qingzhen, Wang Pijiang, and Liu Chengyu reviewed the case and found it to be valid. The Control Yuan submitted the case to the National Government, which then transferred it to the Commission.</p>
<p>Reasoning: The accused, Sheng Shicai, argued that Xinjiang Province was isolated beyond the borders, and the ethnic groups were complex. It was essential to understand the internal and external situations and strengthen intelligence work. However, this could not be done without a significant amount of funds, and the confidentiality was paramount, unlike ordinary expense or confidential expense expenditures that could be reviewed. Therefore, to maintain confidentiality and reduce the burden on the provincial treasury, he arranged for the cotton transport and sale, using the profits to support special confidential expenses. The purchased cotton was handled at the market price at the time, and there was no devaluation. Furthermore, when Sheng Shicai was transferred away from Xinjiang, the cotton transport and sale business had not yet been settled. At that time, it was estimated that there would be a surplus of about 30 million. Later, the Gansu Provincial Security Command pursued the handler, Tie Kun, and recovered the funds. The actual surplus was 48 million (as evidenced by the Gansu Provincial Security Command's document on the handling of Tie Kun's payment) plus 10 million in interest. After deducting 3 million for Tie Kun, the remaining 55 million was received by Sheng Shicai. The original accusation of over 70 million was incorrect. In addition to cotton, there were no other businesses. The statement in the original accusation about including funds from other businesses was untrue. Regarding the cotton transport and sale process and the method of using the profits as special confidential expenses, as well as whether the remaining funds should be handed over to the provincial treasury or used to subsidize Sheng Shicai himself and the living expenses of poor former subordinates from Xinjiang, he submitted a report to the central government for review and instructions on November 19, 1944. On November 26th, it was approved for use as living expenses for Sheng Shicai and others. He then successively provided assistance to poor former subordinates returning from Xinjiang, totaling 56,072,576 National Currency. The approval date was before Li Pulin and others telegraphed requesting the funds be used for relief. The original accusation that Sheng Shicai, after receiving the information, submitted a report falsely claiming that the deposit was a special fund provided by the central government was not only chronologically incorrect, as Sheng Shicai could not have received the information, but the content of the report was also inconsistent with the actual situation, and it was merely speculation. After reviewing the documents submitted by the accused, the Commission found that the claims regarding the cotton transport and sale process, the method of using the profits as special confidential expenses, the subsidy of the remaining funds for himself and his former subordinates' living expenses, and the approval of the report were not fabricated and should not be questioned. However, the Commission found that the accused began purchasing cotton in the spring of 1943, but did not report the process until November 1944, after he was transferred internally from Xinjiang. Even if the motive for transporting cotton was to meet official needs, proceeding without prior approval was inappropriate, and the fault of violating the law cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, the accused, Sheng Shicai, committed an act described in Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Law on Disciplinary Action for Public Servants. In accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the same law, the decision is as stated in the ruling.</p>

<h3>Truman is Determined to Implement the U.S. Foreign Aid Plan and Refutes the Views Held by Taft</h3>
<p>The Foreign Relief Bill Will Be Gradually Implemented</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Regarding the Republican Senator Taft's criticism that the U.S. government has abandoned its policy of suppressing prices and used a large amount of funds abroad, resulting in a significant increase in the cost of living for the American people, President Truman held a press conference and issued a lengthy statement in response, stating that the government will not abandon its foreign relief plan due to criticism from some Republicans regarding economic issues. To say that the U.S. must abandon its foreign relief plan because it needs to redouble its efforts in the economic field is tantamount to saying that the U.S. should have stopped its war efforts during the war because of domestic economic problems. The foreign relief plan places a heavy burden on the U.S. economy, but price suppression depends on domestic efforts. My request for the business community to voluntarily suppress prices means that if the U.S. wants its economy to be satisfactory to all, it must replace government control with the reason of the business community. Senator Taft's economic theory is flawed. He is completely bound by the old economic cycle theory, which is the alternation between periods of prosperity and depression. I completely oppose this economic defeatism and absolutely cannot agree with it.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] After President Truman announced the appointment of Allen to head the U.S. foreign offices of the international relief program, Allen told reporters that "currently, no foreign personnel have been sent to China, nor will aid to China be implemented immediately." He said that he hopes to go to Rome within two weeks to organize a relief office. According to the $350 million foreign relief bill passed by the U.S. Congress, aid will be provided to places such as Italy, Hungary, Romania, Trieste, and China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The Joint Economic Committee of the House and Senate has begun to study the price issue and has sent written questions to leaders in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and financial sectors, as well as labor union authorities, requesting their opinions. This committee, formerly the Joint Committee on the Economic Report, is tasked with providing legislative recommendations based on President Truman's report on the economic situation.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] British authorities recently announced that the British government, following Marshall's European relief proposal, will cooperate with the U.S. to take emergency measures.</p>
<h3>Griswold Appointed Head of Delegation to Promote the U.S. Aid to Greece Plan; U.S. Military Delegation Inspects the Dardanelles</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman today appointed Griswold, the former governor of Nebraska, as the leader of the U.S. delegation to Greece to carry out the U.S. aid plan. At the same time, Allen, a former Red Cross executive, was appointed as the executive commissioner of the $350 million relief fund. This relief fund is completely separate from the $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey. The personnel to manage aid to Turkey have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Griswold stated in a radio address today that the U.S., given its position, should strive to prevent the recurrence of war. I am now appointed to this position by President Truman and completely agree with the Truman Doctrine. In order to address the current problems, I also advocate using economic power to prevent war, which is better than sending young people to the battlefield again. I am now taking up my new position in Greece and will carry out my duties in accordance with the laws of the House and the President.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ankara, 5th] The U.S. military delegation visiting Turkey recently began a short inspection in the Dardanelles area, which is a strategic location that the Soviet Union has requested to be jointly managed with Turkey.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Regarding the U.S. shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of surplus materials to Greece and Turkey, the War Assets Administration recently stated that negotiations have begun. These materials will be given priority delivery and will be monitored by President Truman. Among them is a large amount of military equipment.</p>
<h3>Eleanor Roosevelt Advocates a Three-Power Conference</h3>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 5th] Eleanor Roosevelt recently gave a speech here, warning that the U.S.'s tendency to encircle the Soviet Union will inevitably destroy the United Nations and advocating for a three-power conference to seek a complete understanding. Roosevelt said that the United Nations cannot exist without the Soviet Union's participation. For example, the League of Nations did not last long because the U.S. did not participate. Regardless of our differences of opinion with other countries, we must be patient and live together. The Soviet Union now recognizes its right to protect its sphere of influence in Europe, just as the U.S. protects Latin America.</p>
<h3>U.S. Agrees to Open Japanese Trade; Japanese Finance Minister Asks for Prompt Determination of Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] People here generally feel extremely excited about the U.S. government's official statement on the 5th, allowing private foreign trade in Japan within two months. Finance Minister Yano specifically made a statement stating that the biggest obstacles to reopening foreign trade and stabilizing the people's livelihood in Japan are the inability to determine the foreign exchange rate. In order to prepare for the reopening of private foreign trade, we first hope that the Allied countries will quickly decide on the exchange rate issue. Also, in order to increase the production volume of export goods, the Japanese government is prepared to take decisive measures, such as determining prices and suppressing the black market. The general economic community in Japan agrees with the U.S.'s statement and Yano's attitude. The Japanese trade community also feels happy about this, believing that after reopening foreign trade, (1) transactions can be enlivened, and (2) it can be clarified which commodities are suitable for export trade.</p>
<h3>North Korean Refugees Migrate to South Korea En Masse</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 6th] The U.S. military command announced today that since the Soviet army arrived in Korea after Japan's defeat, refugees have been entering the U.S. occupation zone in South Korea in groups. Last month, there were 36,592 people, including 35,163 from North Korea and 1,429 from Northeast China. They are temporarily seeking food and shelter in four refugee camps in preparation for continuing south. The mass migration of people from North Korea has had a serious impact on the food supply in the South Korean region.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission Seems to Have Made Some Progress</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 6th] Major General Brown, head of the U.S. delegation to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, told reporters today that an agreement on the establishment of a Korean government could be reached in the short term.

<h3>Zheng Tianting Honored</h3>
<p>Elected Vice President of the International Law Association</p>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 6th] Chinese Ambassador to Britain Dr. Zheng Tianting recently received two very honorable titles here. One is that he was elected honorary vice president of the International Law Association to commend his profound knowledge of international commercial law and his past contributions to the Hague International Court. In addition, the ambassador was also appointed as a member of the executive committee of the Comparative Legislative Research Society.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Formally Approves Peace Treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary</h3>
<p>Effective Only After Approval by France and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The U.S. Senate tonight approved the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The first vote was on the Italian treaty, which passed by a vote of 79 to 10. The peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were then passed in turn by voice vote. Prior to the vote, opposition leader Democratic Senator Fulbright made a final attempt to delay the approval of the treaties until January next year. This amendment was defeated by a vote of 67 to 22. Senator Connolly made a final appeal before the vote, saying that refusing to approve the treaty with Italy could cause chaos in Italy and allow communism to take the opportunity to invade Italy. The opposition was exceptionally weak in today's debate. Democratic Senator McMahon said, "I believe that whether or not the treaty with Italy is approved has little impact on lasting world peace. The U.S.'s task is only to prevent Italy from following in Hungary's footsteps and falling into the conspiracy of the Communist Party. If Italy becomes a Communist vassal, then France will enter the same path in a few weeks. If so, then the goal that Hitler intended to complete can be completed by the Soviet Union." McMahon also expressed fear about the situation after British and American troops withdraw from Italy. He said, "The Soviet Union has invaded Hungary, while Britain and the United States will withdraw from Italy. This withdrawal may be a signal for the Soviet Union to acquire Italy." The treaties with the former satellite states of Germany have now been approved by Britain and the United States and are awaiting approval by the Soviet Union and France. The approvals must be sent to Paris or Moscow before they can take effect.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Anti-Soviet Leader Petkov Arrested; Bulgarian Prime Minister Criticizes the Truman Doctrine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 6th, Broadcast: The movement to purge anti-Soviet leaders in the Balkans has now expanded to Bulgaria. According to the British Foreign Office, the Soviet Union has refused to provide evidence regarding the rumored anti-democratic conspiracy in Hungary. The Bulgarian government, controlled by the Communist Party, has arrested Petkov, the leader of the National United Farmers' Party, who has been the most vocal in criticizing the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources in Bulgaria, Petkov's arrest is a prelude to cracking down on the anti-communist movement in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] Moscow Radio on the 5th summarized the words of Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, accusing U.S. President Truman of instigating an anti-democratic and fascist trend. It is claimed that when Dimitrov met with Fischer, a reporter from London's "Daily Mail," Fischer asked him for his opinion on Truman's recent speech on the Balkans. Dimitrov replied, "Although I respect the president of this great country, I must solemnly state that, in my opinion, the U.S. president's current speech is encouraging anti-democratic elements and the resurgence of fascist regimes. Therefore, I cannot believe that this speech contributes to peace and democracy. I do not believe that this speech helps to eliminate the mutual distrust that exists between some countries in the Balkans or helps to establish peace and security in the Balkans."</p>
<h3>U.S. Transfers Control of Occupied Areas to Civilian Administration; State Department and Army Department Prepare to Discuss</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to what United Press has learned today, the U.S. Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of State have abused the power of their respective departments and begun preparing to transfer the occupied areas under the administration of American soldiers in Europe and the Pacific to civilian administration. Marshall and Patterson have exchanged letters, agreeing to engage in preliminary discussions. This change does not mean that the Army will withdraw from the occupied areas, but rather that the Army will transfer the political tasks in Germany, England, Japan, and Korea to experts from the State Department, while only undertaking preparatory tasks to maintain order. The State Department has organized several committees to visit the Army Department next week in order to learn as much information as possible about the occupied areas. The Army Department's attempt to transfer the rule of the occupied areas to the State Department has been delayed for a long time due to the opposition of former Secretary of State Byrnes. However, after Marshall became Secretary of State, the State Department's policy changed. Marshall himself first proposed this transfer suggestion when he was Chief of Staff. The Army believes that its task is to fight wars, not to undertake the administrative affairs of occupying countries. The State Department's personnel will investigate this issue, such as supply personnel, budgets, policy decisions, transportation, housing, education, and ideological transformation plans. Subsequently, the State Department will discuss the actual methods and plans for taking over with the Army Department. The responsibility for managing all matters in the occupied areas will be borne by Assistant Secretary of State Hilldring. He has requested retirement several times, but each time Marshall has ordered him to remain in office. If Hilldring resigns, the administrative authorities believe that he will be succeeded by General Clay, the current Army commander in the European occupied area.</p>
<h3>Britain to Transfer Jurisdiction of the Turtle Islands to the Philippines</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 6th, Broadcast: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office stated that once the administrative details are finalized, the British government intends to transfer jurisdiction of the Tawi-Tawi (Turtle) Islands to the Republic of the Philippines. This transfer of jurisdiction was proposed by Philippine Vice President Quirino based on a treaty signed by Britain and the United States in 1930. The treaty stipulates that the islands are included within the territory of the Philippines, but are temporarily under the jurisdiction of North Borneo, with the condition that they should be transferred to the Filipinos upon request by the Philippine government.</p>
<h3>Rumors that Vyshinsky Arrived in Czechoslovakia to Strengthen Communist Forces in Czech Territory</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Government officials recently stated that they received a report from the U.S. Embassy in Czechoslovakia three days ago stating that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had arrived in the city of Carlsbad. It is claimed that Vyshinsky's trip is ostensibly only for rest in that place, and there has been no word as to whether he will strengthen the communist forces in Czechoslovakia as rumored. However, it is believable that he will hold talks with Communist Prime Minister Gottwald and other Communist leaders. It is said that Vyshinsky's visit to Czechoslovakia is secretly to strengthen the position of the Communist Party in Hungary, but that is currently purely speculative.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Support Germany as a Soviet Factory</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 6th] Dulles, the Republican consultant who accompanied Marshall to the Moscow Conference, said in a broadcast yesterday that the Soviet Union has decided to risk supporting a strong Germany, hoping that it will be ruled by the Communist Party and become a Soviet factory. He said that the Soviet Union's insistence on establishing a powerful industrial Germany with a central government is the only five obstacles to the stalemate of the German peace treaty. He said that the Soviet Union's expectations for Germany are: (1) to establish a strong central government with Berlin in the Soviet-occupied zone as the center. (2) Rule by the Communist Party alone. (3) Organize a general labor union to bring all labor unions in the country under the control of Berlin.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Abolishes Death Penalty Laws; Applicable in Occupied Areas as Well</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th, United Press] The Soviet Union's law abolishing the death penalty is also applicable to all people under the Soviet military and civilian administration, including German people residing in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany and the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin. Germans who have been sentenced to death but have not been executed will have their sentences reduced to 25 years of labor.</p>

<h3>Bevin, Eden, and Others Received Bomb Letters</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin and former Foreign Secretary Eden have both received letters with explosives attached. So far, 11 officials have received these letters. All of the explosive letters were mailed from Italy. According to Eden's report to the London Police Department, he initially thought that the letter was unimportant. At that time, he did not have time to open it, so he put it in his briefcase. Later, he forgot about it. Before he became suspicious, he carried his briefcase around for as long as twenty-four small advances, once even taking it to his office in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>[United Press, Milan, 5th] According to sources from the Italian Senior Police Department, British secret agents have arrived in Milan to investigate the "bomb letters" case sent from Italy to British officials.</p>
<h3>Northwest Frontier Province of India League Stops Disobedience Movement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Northwest Frontier Province, Peshawar, 5th] Jinnah, chairman of the Muslim League, today ordered the cessation of the disobedience movement, which has been underway for more than three months in the Northwest Frontier Province. Jinnah recently met with the Indian Governor-General and promised to stop the movement in order to hold a referendum to decide whether to join Pakistan or Hindustan. In the Northwest Frontier Province, Muslims account for the vast majority of residents, while the government is composed of Congress Party members. Therefore, Jinnah ordered the launch of a disobedience movement in protest.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 6th, Broadcast: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt presented a foreign policy report in Parliament stating that at the informal meeting held in Washington in May by representatives from Australia, Britain, the United States, and New Zealand, Australia offered the opinion that Japan should be permanently prohibited from owning a navy and air force during the United Nations' control period. He also said that the peace treaty with Japan should be resolved as a whole and not individually. To recognize the Far Eastern Commission as a mediating body for Japan is fundamentally wrong in principle.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Textile Industry Association of Six Districts Plans to Extend Working Hours</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Cotton Textile Industry Association of the six districts of this city convened a general meeting of members yesterday to discuss the issue of wage payments after the cost-of-living index was unfrozen. They unanimously agreed that the increase in the index has greatly affected production costs. Only through cooperation and understanding between labor and management, and increased production, can the burden of high wages on the factory side be compensated. Protecting the livelihood of the workers themselves is also the top priority. Therefore, it is planned to negotiate with the labor union to extend working hours under reasonable circumstances. Wages for June will still be paid according to the May index, and wages for July will be paid according to the June index, sequentially delaying by one month to reduce the May payroll, which has mostly been paid at 22,500 times.</p>
<h3>Increased Costs Due to Unfreezing of the Index: Representatives of Several Trade Associations Petition</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Representatives from the Machine Industry Association and the Foundry Industry, Electrical Equipment Industry, Shipbuilding Industry, and several other trade associations in this city held a meeting yesterday. Because most of the factories of the member associations of the Machine Industry Association had accepted orders during the index freeze, and the product costs relied heavily on labor rather than materials, the sudden increase in wages by several times due to the unfreezing of the index has become an unbearable burden for various factories. It was decided to send representatives to petition the municipal government at 10:30 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Strike by Western Clothing Tailors: Management Declares the Situation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Thirteen tailors from Peiqi Western Clothing Store on Nanjing West Road and other stores have collectively gone on strike, as reported in yesterday's newspapers. According to the management of the stores, the strike occurred because the workers, after the cost-of-living index was unfrozen, did not comply with the work amount stipulated by the arbitration committee, demanded an increase in the work amount, and maintained subsidies and other expenses from before the unfreezing. The management believes that this is in conflict with Articles 2 and 7 of the Shanghai Wage Adjustment Measures and has not agreed, leading to the collective strike.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Index in the Machine Industry: The Social Affairs Bureau Mediates and Agrees on Principles: Each Company Should Disburse According to Its Capacity</h3>
<p>[Reported by this office] Due to the dispute over the index caused by the capital side of the machine industry in this city, Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a symposium of representatives from both sides at 3:00 PM yesterday to seek an agreement. More than ten people attended, including Huang Chongyi, Director-General of the Trade Association, and Xu Binggen, representative of the Industrial Workers' Union of Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4. During the meeting, both sides argued strongly. The labor side stated that if the capital side was unable to bear the cost, they could seek an agreement directly with the workers, and the Trade Association should not notify each factory to generally disburse according to 14,800 times the rate, as this would violate government regulations. The Trade Association representative stated that the notification to each factory was not a mandatory regulation. Finally, under the mediation of Director Zhao, principles were agreed upon. All workers' wages should be disbursed according to each factory's economic capacity, and adjustments would be made after a thorough resolution.</p>
<p>Cigarette Wages: Agreed Upon Method</p>
<p>The Labor-Capital Cooperation Promotion Committee of the cigarette industry in this city, in view of the fact that various cigarette factories are facing difficulties in sourcing raw materials and are experiencing sluggish business, and are unable to bear the burden of workers' wages, the capital committee members Yao Shushen and Gu Shaoqing and nine other labor committee members Zhou Xuexiang and Yuan Zhaoxin had sincere discussions. For the issue of issuing May wages, it was decided: (1) For the first half of May wages, in addition to the 14,000 times rate that has already been issued, the remaining 9,500 times rate will be issued starting from June 16, but must be cleared before July 10 at the latest. (2) For the second half of May wages, the government-announced index of 23,500 times will not be discounted for the time being and will be issued from today. The overpaid deduction will be deducted when issuing the first half of June wages together. (3) If labor and capital of each factory have already reached an agreement, the agreement will still be implemented and will not be bound by these methods. (4) Hereafter, wage issuance will be regulated to issue wages for the first half of each month according to the index of the previous month. (5) Factories that suspend work starting from the second half of each month must not delay the wages for the first half of the month and must be issued on schedule. (6) Factories that suspend work starting from the first half of each month must issue the wages for the second half of the month with the prescribed discount.</p>

(2) The cost-of-living index for general workers will be 75% of 23,500 times, and the base salary calculation will be the same as for technicians. (3) For staff members with base salaries within 50 yuan, the cost-of-living index will be calculated at 16,400 times. For those above 50 yuan, in addition to calculating the first 50 yuan according to the above method, the excess amount will be calculated at 85% of the cost-of-living index. (4) The cost-of-living index for trainees will be 75% of 16,400 times. (5) In the future, if the cost-of-living index rises to 40,000 times, a meeting will be convened to discuss it together.

<h3>Nine More Major Criminals Apprehended in the Sima Road Murder Case: They Confess to Taking the Association's Funds Without Permission and Seeking Revenge</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] In the murder case that occurred in front of the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Sima Road late at night on the 1st of this month, the victim, Chou Lianhuan, was struck by four axes. He was sent to the hospital but died due to his injuries. After the incident, in addition to apprehending Hang Yinquan, who committed the crime on the spot and was shot by Chou, the Laozha Police Branch also arrested Mao Qingyu, who was responsible for keeping watch, at No. 20 Changshou Lane, Changan Road, overnight with the Detective Section of the General Bureau. After investigation, he confessed that the masterminds behind the scenes were Lu Wenying, Xue Fuyuan, Feng Renyi, Sheng Shugen, Bai Laili, Li Bin, and others. However, Lu Wenying and Xue Fuyuan have been defended by their wives in the newspapers, proving that they were not involved in the case. The remaining criminals, as well as Ye Dongying (nicknamed Hercules), Wei Xiaoyang, and others who committed the crime on the spot, were assigned by Zheng Junhou, Chief of the Detective Section of the Police Bureau, to Zhu Mengqi, the section chief, along with staff members Chen Xianrong, Gan Yuanma Feimu, Ding Wenyang, Wu Yaozu, and Liu Qingliang, to investigate and bring them back for interrogation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Command was also ordered by Captain Qi Zaiwang to assign a large number of staff members to assist in the pursuit. As of yesterday, Sheng Shugen, Wei Xiaoyang, Ye Dongying, Li Desheng, Ma Caide, Chai Liangjiang, Wu Xiaomao, Chu Shurong, and Ye Dongying's mistress, Wang Aixiang, have been apprehended one after another. According to preliminary investigations, it was learned that the case was caused by a person named Chuan Qifu (nicknamed Little Ghost Afu), who recently won an association fund of 1.8 million yuan. Chou took the funds without Chuan's consent, and after negotiating with him, nothing came of it, and he held a grudge. At the same time, Chou had feuds with Chuan's friends Zhang Xingbao (who had been assassinated), Feng Renyi, Li Bin, Sheng Shugen, Bai Laili, etc. Therefore, after consultation, they decided to use</p>
<p>force for revenge.</p>
<p>Feng and others then hired hitmen Ye Dongying, Wei Xiaoyang, Ma Caide, and others, waiting until the night of the 1st, knowing that Chou was attending a friend's banquet at the Atlantic Western Restaurant. Ma Caide then notified each hitman by telephone at 10:30 PM in the Jincheng Billiard Hall on Sima Road to gather in front of the Tianchan Theater. Waiting until 11:45 PM, they saw Chou walking out of the Atlantic. They rushed forward, originally intending to "touch Chou Lianhuan's bad luck" and "borrow a foot for use", so Ye Dongying chopped his left leg with an axe. Unexpectedly, Chou immediately pulled out a self-defense pistol and fired two shots at Hang Yinquan, one of which hit Hang, and the other injured a prostitute named Lu Peihua. At this point, Wei Xiaoyang and others chopped his two wrists and the back of his head three more times, eventually causing him to</p>
<p>fall to the ground due to serious injuries.</p>
<p>They dispersed, but the details are still being investigated by the police. It is reported that Chou had many disciples, most of whom were performing comic dramas. Xiao Kuaile, who was attacked by rice merchants for the rice weevil incident last month, was also one of his proud disciples. Therefore, after Chou's death, Xiao broadcast "Crying for Chou Lianhuan" on the radio to repay his teacher's kindness. As for the arrest locations of each criminal, they included No. 53 Xianmianci Lane, Penglai Road, Nanshi; No. 10 Yinggongci Lane, Nanshi; near the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall on Nanjing West Road; and Longhua. However, the main criminals Feng Renyi, Bai Laili, Li Bin, and Fu Qifu are still at large.</p>

<h3>Rabid Dogs Rampant in Hongqiao: One Person Dies</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Lianyu, 19, the fourth daughter of Zhang Zhou, a witch from Sun Genglang, South Hongqiao Town, West Shanghai, was bitten on the right hand by a rabid dog last month.

<h3>Corruption Case in the Municipal Government Cooperative: The Appeal is Concluded and Sentenced; Li Jiancheng Sentenced to Seven Years, Zhu Zhiqin Lightly Sentenced</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Li Jiancheng, former Commissioner of the Municipal Government and Manager of the Employee Consumer Cooperative, and Zhu Zhiqin, the accountant of the cooperative, were sentenced by the District Court to five years of imprisonment for Li and two years of imprisonment for Zhu for committing corruption. Both defendants refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which remanded the case for retrial. Zhu Yu, Judge of the First Criminal Court of the District Court, announced the verdict yesterday: "Li Jiancheng, for directly seeking profits from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for eight years. Zhu Zhiqin, for assisting in directly seeking profits from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for two years." The reasons for the judgment were that the defendant Li Jiancheng had successively withdrawn 14,287,888 yuan from the cooperative in the name of temporary business expenses, claiming that the previous funds were used to purchase a car for the use of the cooperative as proof. Also, the defendant's defense that the manager of the cooperative was not a civil servant and could not constitute the crime of corruption was also not accepted. As for the defendant Zhu Zhiqin, who served as the accountant of the cooperative, she repeatedly prepared and paid the above-mentioned funds for the continuous use of the defendant Li Jiancheng without any receipt vouchers, and falsely reported the statement of receipts and expenditures sent to the Shanghai City Bank as being used for the purchase of trucks and thermos bottles, which should also constitute the crime of assisting corruption. However, because the defendant was under the supervision of Li, the circumstances of the crime were particularly pitiful, so she was given a light sentence.</p>

<h3>Schools Should Continue Classes as Usual, Students Should Focus on Their Studies, Appeal from Overseas Chinese in Penang</h3>
<p>[Penang, 6th Dispatch] To the Shanghai Shenbao and All Compatriots in the Country: Recent student unrest in the motherland has caused social disorder, which is deeply distressing to overseas Chinese. It is understandable that students are concerned about national affairs, but at this time, discussing national affairs must involve distinguishing right from wrong so as not to be taken advantage of. It is also important to understand that peace is a matter for both sides. Merely striking and marching, or even rioting, to threaten one side will only increase the arrogance of the other side and increase the difficulty of peace. Overseas Chinese sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in the country will uphold justice, persuade students to return to the right path, and hope that the government authorities will quickly adopt wise measures to maintain order so that schools can continue classes as usual and students can focus on their studies. The future of the country will be fortunate. Respectfully submitted by Penang Reading Newspaper Society and all societies and schools.</p>

The Ministry of Education hired organizing committee members on May 2 and convened the first preparatory meeting, publicly electing me as the chief secretary. Since then, we have been actively carrying out preparatory matters. At that time, there were two important issues that needed to be resolved urgently: (1) Negotiating with the Ministry of National Defense to cede the Jiangtao Gymnasium in the center of Shanghai, (2) Fundraising. Up to now, regarding the first point of the venue issue, the Jiangtao Gymnasium has been largely ceded, and some repair materials have been obtained. Part of it is still being sought. Regarding the second point, although the fundraising has not reached the expected figure, it is also being successfully negotiated with all parties and is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on Double Ten this year. Due to the fact that the preparatory work cannot be completed as scheduled, the result of consultations with Mayor Wu, the director of the National Games preparations, is to change the date to May 5 next year and still hold it in Shanghai. The repair work on the sports field is still actively underway. All provinces and cities and overseas Chinese are still expected to actively prepare for the preliminary elections.

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Shanghai the previous day, taking an overnight train from Nanjing, and arrived here at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday. This newspaper's reporter made a special trip to interview him and was received. He said: The main task of this trip to Shanghai is to inspect the work of various affiliated agencies of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai. He roughly plans to stay in Shanghai for four days and return to Nanjing on the evening train next Monday.</p>
<p>The reporter then raised several questions, and he answered them to the best of his knowledge. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the government's economic policies, in the past, emphasis was placed on control, but since the reorganization of the government, it has been moving towards a free economy. However, he stated that due to the current situation, the free economic policy must still be subject to considerable restrictions in order to take the facts into consideration.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, which is being established, he met with Zou Bingwen, who will be the chairman of the committee, yesterday to discuss the future affairs of the committee and jointly plan its promotion, so that the committee can be established as soon as possible to take over the affairs of the current Textile Industry Management Committee. Although the designated chairman of the committee, Zou Bingwen, has not yet taken office, he has been doing his best to persuade him to accept the new position, and there should be no problem.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the original regulations of the Textile Industry Management Committee on the control of yarn shipped to Hankou, the possibility of cancellation can be considered. Detailed methods will be announced after the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee is established.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, he summoned the person in charge of the committee yesterday to inquire about the current work situation in detail. Regarding the current coal supply problem, he instructed the committee to find ways to dredge the coal source and keep transportation uninterrupted. Protecting mines and roads should be planned and considered together so that the coal supply can be continuously replenished. At the same time, the government is currently entrusting the Central Trust Bureau to order 50,000 tons of foreign coal from Canada to increase the coal supply.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the adjustment of coal prices: the government has now decided that the government will continue to be responsible for subsidizing the coal used by railways and public utilities. As for general factories and civilian coal, the price is calculated based on the cost of coal plus transportation costs to maintain the profitability of the mines.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the management of the dismantling and transfer of Japanese industrial equipment in our country: He estimated that the total construction cost would be over 100 billion national currency.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding the US loan to our country, he said that the opinion circles have been quite optimistic recently, and based on his personal feelings, he also believes that there is a strong hope. As for the amount, it remains to be decided by the United States.</p>

<h3>Money Market Suddenly Tightens Again; Yong Yarn Declines All the Way; Small Stocks Show Slight Stability</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market suddenly tightened again, and the bulls in the industry suddenly collapsed. A 30% margin deposit generally required cash. Outsiders hesitated to move forward, and transactions were extremely sparse. There were many cracks in the environment. Although small stocks were still peaceful, Yong yarn formed a one-sided downward trend, gradually declining. Match and Commercial also reported a limit down. The future will still tend to be volatile.</p>
<p>The morning opening was quite stable due to the huge difference in the closing price of the previous day's National Bank. All stocks opened higher. After the opening of the successive Yong yarns, Nos. 27 and 186 advanced, once rising to 6820 yuan. Nos. 190, 117, 154, 133, 223, 231, 76, 31, 102, 155, and 89 were sold off and gradually went downstream, retreating to 6630 yuan.

People's hearts could not bear it and it fell to within 6400 yuan. Around 11:00, the market price formed a seesaw within 6400 yuan. Before long, No. 32 added to the sell-off, and Nos. 180, 47, 137, and 44 sold to 6200 yuan. No. 129 also went out after entering, and the report went downstream again.

Nos. 186, 177, 91, 185, and 224 came to accept, and the noon closing rose to 6170 yuan. The recovery shouting price was flat. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the spot stocks Yong yarn, Yonggong, Huafeng, Qinxing, Sino-French, and Xinhua each fell by about half a percent. Xinhe and Xinguang slightly fell. Jingfu slightly rose. Match and Commercial fell to the limit. Lian'an underwear, China Silk, and Rongfeng fell by about 10%. Xinya Guohuo, Jinglun, and Datong were still flat.

<h3>China Textile Construction Company's Export Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The Annual Quantity is Expected to Increase</p>

Calculating each piece of yarn at US$300 and each bolt of cloth at US$12, the foreign exchange earned from the annual export of yarn and cloth will reach US$27.6 million.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth are Both Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market opened initially, and the market was still firm and high. Later, the market sentiment turned discouraged due to the sale of yarn by the China Textile Construction Company, and the price did not change much. Many floating households dispersed, which led to new selling, and the price fell.

Throughout the day, the market for 20-count and 16-count yarns was mixed, while 32-count and 42-count various brands of fine yarn fell slightly from 50,000 to 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the morning opening was driven by the news that the Hankou transportation and sales control would be lifted. People's hearts were excited, and sporadic absorption was not weak. The market trend was bullish. Unexpectedly, by the time of closing, the price of yarn fell, and many dispersed investors rushed to sell off, and the market turned weak. As a result, the Four Gentlemen, Golden Seal, Drill, and Twill, from Jiangxi gang saw low absorption, bleached cloth, poplin, and Broadcloth were replenished in the street, and the market was still firm. The remaining fine cloth and fine twill were all weak.</p>
<h3>Arrivals are Few and Inventories are Depleted; Autumn and Winter Woolens are Selling Well</h3>
<p>Summer woolen goods have chaotic standards. Those with strength and door shops still mostly hold firm and refuse to sell cheaply. Conversely, they are willing to cut prices to sell off. Therefore, the transaction prices at tea parties often differ. Deep-colored woolens for autumn and winter demand, Chinese and Western suit fancy woolens, serge, valencia, melton overcoat woolens, etc., were all traded yesterday. Those with remaining strength from the local gang successively searched for goods. Because fine wool, glossy wool, and serge that are transported in and produced and stored are increasingly scarce, it is expected that prices will rise again in the autumn.</p>

As for the bonds subscribed by the Six-District Cotton Spinning Association, the Central Trust Bureau has signed a contract with the association, in which the association's factories provide a certain amount of cotton yarn and request the assistance of the China Textile Construction Company to provide a certain amount of cotton yarn for the Central Trust Bureau to export. The foreign exchange obtained will be used to purchase bond funds.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Settlement Method for Second Quarter Foreign Cotton Imports Determined by the National Bank; Purchasing Allowed Based on Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank issued Circular No. 101 yesterday to designated banks regarding the application for foreign exchange settlement for foreign cotton import quotas for May to July of this year. The content is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the import quotas for cotton for the second quarter of this year (May to July) approved by the Import Restriction Distribution Office of the Provisional Management Committee, a method has been negotiated with the Central Bank, and the New York Citibank China Bank New York Branch and the New York Chase Bank will provide financial accommodation. The entrustment purchase certificates for the foreign cotton can be opened at the Shanghai Citibank and the Foreign Department of the Bank of China, and designated banks should notify the yarn factories accordingly. The procedures to be followed can be compared to the provisions of this Bank's previously announced Circular No. 95.</p>
<p>The Import Quota Allocation Office, in view of the urgent need to ship the US cotton quota with export subsidies, has considered canceling the previous regulation that yarn factories must hold an import license before they can open an entrustment purchase certificate. For this US cotton, designated banks may change to opening an entrustment purchase certificate based on the Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificate issued by the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee. The amount should not exceed what is necessary for the quantity of cotton to be ordered as specified in the Allocation Certificate. What the designated banks must pay special attention to is that this Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificate only specifies the quantity of foreign cotton approved for ordering, so it is necessary to carefully check the amount of foreign exchange applied for in the entrustment purchase certificate (excluding expenses such as deferred delivery and losses).</p>
<p>Once the import license is issued, each designated bank must still record the detailed records of foreign exchange settlement and sales on the back of the license as usual."</p>
<h3>Rice Arrivals Increase, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The source of rice in the market has suddenly become smooth. Many ships from Songqing gang arrived yesterday, and many goods also came from Suxi Chang and were being unloaded. Although the market registration was only more than 5,000 piculs, the actual arrivals were more than 10,000 piculs. Because the market saw a smooth flow of goods, the market atmosphere softened, people's hearts hesitated, and most people waited and watched without moving forward. Transactions were scarce, and all goods fell uniformly. High-quality white japonica rice returned to 425,000 yuan, a drop of 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour digestion was idle and scattered. New wheat has been seen, and people's hearts are weak, returning low by 12,000 yuan. Bran rural sales were moving but not prosperous, and the situation became stagnant. Soybean cake customers were accompanying the purchase. It was firm in the morning and light in the afternoon, and the shape tended to soften. Soybean oil factories adopted it. Both Hankou Zha beans and Northeastern soybeans turned up by a thousand yuan, while Du soybeans were still flat. Red beans were sluggish and fell by 35,000 yuan. Kidney beans gradually decreased, falling another 35,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum removal was moving but not prosperous, and continued to fall by 35,000 yuan. Corn from Beiyang did not move and continued to decrease by 35,000 yuan. Sesame foreign merchants were active and rose by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts stood out, Chen wheat stood firm, the source of new wheat has not yet been prosperous, and there are no rises and falls for the time being. New broad beans high-quality goods are diverted and moved slightly, the price shape is temporarily flat, but the lower grades are still seeing a small drop. New Yuan wheat failed because the goods were of poor quality, and it was difficult to find customers, falling by 35,000 yuan. The oil market stores were still okay, and continued to rise by 10,000 yuan, turning light at noon, with little volatility.</p>
<p>Another report: Miscellaneous grains from Sichuan Province are gradually moving east. If corn raw peanuts and green beans have successively arrived in Shanghai, alcohol has also arrived in Shanghai, and the price of Sichuan rice is low. Merchants are planning to go to purchase. The Rice Industry Association has a certificate to handle the transportation of Sichuan rice to Shanghai by merchants.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Purchase Chinese Black Tea in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th: It is reported that the Soviet commercial representative in Hong Kong recently negotiated with local tea merchants to purchase 1,000 piculs of Chinese black tea. General observers believe that the biggest factor in the Soviet Union's attention to the Hong Kong market is that China's official foreign exchange rate is too high. Recently, the tea market here has been depressed, and Chinese black tea has fallen from US$160 per picul to US$80 per picul.</p>
<h3>Buyer's Hopes Become Illusions Again; Unified Bond Decline is Very Severe; External Stocks Have Poor Environment and Also Decline</h3>
<p>The bond market collapsed yesterday because the proposal to repay the conference by a multiple of the reported number was rejected, and Minister Yu made a strong statement. The buyer's hopes became illusions again. Unified Series C opened in the morning and fell to 9,500 yuan, as low as 7,500 yuan. Then it rose to around 8,300 yuan to end. Baolong and many scattered investors cut up to 503 rooms and there were compensations. Under a turnover of more than 6 million, compared with the previous closing, Series A, B, and D fell by 3,400, Unified Series C fell by 4,800, and Unified Series E also fell by 3,700.</p>
<p>External stocks were sold yesterday due to securities gang and retail inventory resales, and the environment was pessimistic. Although the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram reported a shrinkage to 14.2 yuan, it did not help the overall situation. Jardine Spinning fell from an initial 65,500 yuan in the morning to the 60,000 yuan border and then leveled off slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing, British Airways and Jardine Beer each fell by half a percent, and Jardine Spinning Steel fell by about 10%. The remaining stocks all declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Textile Industry Management Committee Approves the Amount of Yarn and Cloth Transported North and South</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Industry Management Committee announced yesterday the review process of yarn and cloth manufacturers transported to the north as follows: (1) 133 factories applied for registration and passed the review. (2) 256 distributors applied for registration and passed the review. (3) 156 factories registered to transport south have passed and have received registration cards. (4) 100 manufacturers applied for registration and failed the review. The committee has scheduled to notify the manufacturers on the 9th. After receiving the notification, the approved manufacturers must bring their original seals to the committee within three days to collect their registration cards. After the registration card procedures are completed, the committee will separately notify the manufacturers of the quota of yarn and cloth transported to the north this month. It is expected that applications for yarn and cloth transported to the north can be accepted starting on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>The quota of yarn and cloth transported south this month has also been calculated and announced by the committee as follows: Cotton yarn: Last month's balance was 258 pieces, plus this month's original quota of 2,967 pieces, and the total quota of cotton yarn transported south this month was 3,225 pieces. Cotton cloth: Last month's balance was 1,303 bolts, plus this month's original quota of 75,647 bolts, and the total quota of cotton cloth transported south this month was 76,950 bolts. Special project: The yarn is still 2,000 pieces. The cloth's last month balance was 20,759 bolts, plus this month's original quota of 35,000 bolts, and this month's special project southern transported cloth was 55,759 bolts. The committee will notify the southern transportation manufacturers of the numbers today. Applications for yarn and cloth transported south can be accepted starting on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales are Active</h3>
<p>The foreign tea market saw gradually active transactions yesterday, but there was no change in prices. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, they continued to be smooth, and especially slightly baked, pearl cocoon, and other green teas were sold more smoothly. However, the market trend was affected by the goods, and there were varying degrees of rises and falls compared to the previous day. It is learned that recently the Tianjin gang has suddenly paid attention to green tea core, and it is heard that they are willing to accept any price at 35,000 to 36,000 yuan per picul. However, the goods side is reluctant to part with it at this low price, so whether or not the transaction will be completed is still being brewed.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market is Still Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market atmosphere was deserted because foreign peers were reselling, and the people in the market were idle. Wholesale transactions were very rare, and there were only sporadic supplements. At the morning opening, ten Great British marriages were 6.4 million yuan. Afterwards, they gradually fell. The afternoon was even more sluggish. It was also heard that many Qalique cigarettes were brought in from Hong Kong, and sellers were active. Finally, the price of ten Great British marriages was as low as 6.265 million yuan, a further drop of 155,000 yuan compared to the previous day, Old Knife dropped by 30,000 yuan, Wu Hua dropped by 60,000 yuan, and Hader gate dropped by 90,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the paper cigarettes and tinned cigarettes of various Chinese and foreign factories fell uniformly. Only Jin Mao and Great Kraiss Axes and other two or three brands had a harder footing.</p>
<h3>8,000 Tons of Civilian Coal; Negotiated Prices Have Been Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Fuel Management Committee's second phase of 8,000 tons of coal for general users. The price negotiated at the second meeting of the Price Review Council was approved by Director Wu Kaixian as follows: No. 2 Kailuan Lump Coal 500,000 per ton, Fuxin Lump Coal 555,000 per ton, US Nut White Coal 836,000 per ton, US Small-Size White Coal 702,000 per ton.

<h3>Passenger and Freight Rates of Shipping Industry Increased by Different Percentages</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association previously sent personnel to Nanjing to request the cancellation of subsidies and the implementation of industry-agreed price methods. Starting this month, passenger and freight rates on each line will be adjusted. It is learned that the Ministry of Communications has agreed in principle to the industry's request. The association convened a rate committee the day before yesterday to formulate the price increase standards and asked the joint meeting of directors and supervisors to decide yesterday afternoon to submit the proposed adjusted prices to the Ministry of Communications for approval. It is learned that the passenger and freight rates that the industry has requested to be adjusted are divided into four types: North and South Ocean Lines, Shanghai-Ningbo Line, Yangtze River Line, and Opposite River Line. The percentage increase is not uniform, with North and South Ocean Lines increasing by 150%, followed by Shanghai-Rain Line and Yangtze River Line, and Opposite River Line increasing by 100%. As for the adjustment date, the industry hopes to implement it before the middle of the month.</p>
<h3>More Than 4,000 Import Licenses Approved in May</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the Import Management Committee's announcement of the import applications approved and import licenses issued by the committee in May, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Approved Applications　Issued Licenses</p>
<p>Appendix 1　1453 items　1368 items</p>
<p>Appendix 2　383 items　1030 items</p>
<p>Appendix 3　1625 items　539 items</p>
<p>The import licenses in Appendix 3 were originally issued by the Non-Quota Review Office. Since May 17, they have all been changed to be issued by the Imported Goods Management Office. Therefore, there is more backlog this month, which can be cleared entirely in June.</p>
<h3>1,700 Tons of Frozen Eggs; First Batch Shipped to England Yesterday</h3>
<p>Spring and summer, namely the four months of March, April, May, and June, are the peak season for egg production in various rural areas of our country. When foreign exchange was adjusted this year, the UK ordered 5,000 tons of frozen eggs from us. Exporters refused to sign the contract because the price was not right. Later, the Central Trust Bureau agreed to assist in exports, and both parties reached a solution. The Central Trust Bureau purchased them at a price of 9 million per ton and then transported them to the UK. Yesterday, the Central Trust Bureau assisted egg merchants in transporting 1,700 tons. There are still 3,300 tons left, and the egg merchants have once again expressed their unwillingness to sell because the cost has risen by 80% compared to before. If they are purchased at the old price, the losses will be enormous. The Central Trust Bureau is currently considering increasing the purchase price to maintain the contract.</p>

<h3>The Medical World's Infatuation with Skeletons</h3>
<p>— Wen Si</p>
<p>On May 10th, when I attended the closing ceremony of the Chinese Medical Association's conference, an old friend sitting behind me suddenly handed me a clipping. I didn't bother to read it closely at the time, and just casually put it in my pocket, because articles of the "Dedicated to the Medical Association" type were very numerous during the conference, and none stood out particularly. A few days after the conference, I re-read this clipping, and it was like a bolt out of the blue, leaving me stunned!</p>
<p>That "traditional Chinese medicine" is unscientific and anti-scientific is an undeniable fact. Yet, there are still people who say it is a "cultural heritage," believing that "this kind of medicine is not entirely without value; it cures many diseases, it has many good raw or unrefined remedies, it uses the Five Elements theory to explain physiological phenomena, and bases its diagnoses on pulse taking to prescribe medicine, often with accurate results," openly arguing its "unscientific" and "anti-scientific" nature! Moreover, they say, "No papers analyzing the Five Elements physiological phenomenon theory have been seen, which Zhu Mian finds regrettable!"</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, in this modern era and society, the appearance of such arguments can indeed be considered regrettable. Twenty years ago, while articles criticizing traditional medicine as unscientific and anti-scientific weren't exactly abundant enough to fill carts, they weren't entirely absent either. Mr. Yu Yunxiu's "Collection of Essays on Medical Revolution" and "Ling Shu Wen Dui" are among the most systematic and comprehensive works. Mr. Chen Fangzhi also wrote many critiques of traditional medicine, and both of these scientific doctors are still alive and well. The Tianjin Dagongbao Medical Weekly before the war also frequently featured critiques of traditional medicine a decade or so ago. These old books and newspapers are naturally not to be found on today's book stalls. Those born later who wish to see these things will have to search in historical libraries, such as the National Peiping Library. It is evident that the "negation of the value of traditional medicine" by scientific medical researchers was established decades ago!</p>
<p>Native innovation should not be discussed in the same breath as metaphysical traditional medicine. In the era of uncivilized humanity, there was only magical, mystical witch doctoring. Magic is easily exposed and insufficient to deceive the knowledgeable, so there was a stage of metaphysics. It was not until the development of science that medicine entered the correct path of science, demanding evidence and emphasizing experimentation. Metaphysical medicine is a stage in the development history of medicine, and this is true for every nation. The Five Elements are not a unique product of the Republic of China; India has four elements, and the West also has four humors. Their medicine fifty years ago was full of this kind of metaphysics, and even today, there are still many remnants. There are many who dream of excavating some "gems" from traditional Chinese medicine, and a few are still working hard at it. However, given the extreme shortage of medical talent in China, and the need for people to do many important tasks, most experienced individuals do not advocate for accomplished medical professionals to engage in this kind of non-urgent task. The reason why there is such a demand in society is because people are deceived by the fact that traditional medicine "cures many diseases." The so-called "cure" is in reality "taking credit belonging to heaven."</p>
<p>The value of traditional medicine has long been determined. Our eastern neighbor, while foolishly militaristic, is undeniably much smarter than the Chinese in its understanding of science. The development of scientific medicine is comparable to that of the West. They determined the value of Huang Han medicine earlier than China and took decisive action. Therefore, there is no longer any dispute between new and old medicine in Japan. Even in Taiwan, in the early days of falling into enemy hands more than forty years ago, they used a one-time registration of old doctors, followed by a permanent cessation of registration, to eliminate it over time. Is it difficult to say that the Japanese are less scientific and lack scientific spirit than us?</p>
<p>Now, in the mid-20th century, when science is so advanced that humanity can utilize atomic energy, Chinese scholars are still treating the outdated traditional medicine of the metaphysical era as a classic. It is truly like an stubborn antiquarian being infatuated with skeletons!</p>
<h3>The Evil Consequences Caused by Tonsillitis in Children</h3>
<p>— Yang Shida</p>
<p>The tonsils, commonly known as "milk moths," are two peach-kernel-sized glands located on either side of the fauces, one on each side. Children are particularly prone to this condition during the autumn and winter seasons when the weather changes. The pediatric outpatient department of the Municipal Fourth Hospital diagnosed a total of 1,771 people in November and December, of whom 99 children had tonsillitis, accounting for more than 5%. This number naturally only includes a small portion, as most children with tonsillitis seek treatment from the Department of Otolaryngology due to throat pain. This report tells us that tonsillitis is a disease that cannot be ignored in children, and it can cause many evil consequences. Many parents are skeptical of recommendations for tonsillectomy and do not accept it, leading to the successive occurrence of complications and even death, which is not unexpected. Now, the symptoms of tonsillitis and the evil consequences it can cause are written below for the reference of parents of children with tonsillitis.</p>
<p>Symptoms of Tonsillitis</p>
<p>Children who often suffer from tonsillitis are mostly physically weak. During seasons of changing weather, they suddenly show discomfort, high fever, headache, fatigue, and indigestion. Infants may also experience convulsions. After this violent prelude, the local symptoms gradually become apparent. The throat feels dry and painful, and swallowing becomes difficult. At this time, examination of the oropharynx reveals that the peach-kernel-shaped tonsils on both sides of the fauces are red and swollen, covered with a layer of mucus, or scattered with a few white spots. The lymph nodes in the angle of the jaw are also affected, with mild swelling and pain. After a few days of appropriate treatment, the redness and swelling of the tonsils will gradually subside, but recurrence is unavoidable. When encountering mild fatigue or exposure to some wind and cold, alarming symptoms will appear again. Thus, these children become regular customers of our pediatricians.</p>
<p>Complications of Tonsillitis</p>
<p>After repeated inflammation, tonsils become a reservoir for various bacteria. Once there is an opportunity, these bacteria will attack the human body. The parts most easily harmed are the organs near the tonsils:</p>
<p>(A) Otitis media and sinusitis: Many children have yellow pus flowing from their ears all year round, which is extremely difficult to cure. Unfortunately, it can also cause meningitis or mastoiditis. In addition, sinusitis (commonly known as brain leakage) is characterized by a constant dripping of foul-smelling pus from the nasal cavity, which is caused by the bacteria hidden in the tonsils spreading into it, causing lesions.</p>
<p>(B) Cervical Lymph Node Abscess: When the lymph nodes in the neck of children with weakened resistance retain too many bacteria after repeated inflammation of the tonsils, they can also suppurate and form sores, which require surgical treatment to heal.</p>
<p>(C) Septicemia: In the most unfortunate cases, the bacteria hidden in the tonsils can invade the bloodstream, causing septicemia (bacteria developing in the blood). In this situation, a few days after the onset of tonsillitis, the general symptoms worsen, the disease turns into a typhoid-like state, the body temperature rises to 39 to 40 degrees Celsius, diarrhea and proteinuria occur, and the disease progresses rapidly, leading to death in a short time. Or, in the process of progression, complications of various organs are found, such as endocarditis, pericarditis, pleurisy, arthritis, nephritis, meningitis, purpura, and nodular erythema. The most common complication of tonsillitis is:</p>
<p>(D) Joint Diseases: This is a common fact in pediatric clinical practice. After children suffer from tonsillitis, various joint diseases follow, including joint pain, joint swelling, and subacute polyarthritis.</p>
<p>(E) Nephritis: Most cases of nephritis in children are caused by tonsillitis. Therefore, the urine of children after illness should be checked frequently. The impact on the kidneys can be very mild, and only a slight degree of proteinuria can be detected to confirm it. However, there are severe damages leading to hematuric nephritis or edematous nephritis, which are generally obvious and cannot be ignored. Proteinuria can also be chronic from the beginning, with proteinuria worsening each time tonsillitis occurs, becoming a lifelong incurable disease. The currently so-called cold nephritis is all caused by tonsillitis, which seems to be an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Treatment of Tonsillitis</p>
<p>Since tonsillitis can cause dangerous evil consequences, it should be treated promptly at the beginning of the illness to prevent it from turning into a chronic problem. Except for a few special bacteria, such as diphtheria, which requires injection of diphtheria serum, and tonsillitis caused by Vincent's spirochetes, which requires injection of 914, the latest treatment is oral and injectable "penicillin," which is extremely effective. Once the signs of inflammation disappear, tonsillectomy can be performed. Performed by experts, it can be said to be painless and without much danger.</p>
<h3>Hygiene for Pregnant Women and During Confinement</h3>
<p>— Jiang Eying</p>
<p>Childbirth is originally a natural phenomenon, not a pathological change. However, because childbirth increases the burden on various parts of the body, hidden problems originally present in the body become apparent and erupt at that time, causing illness. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in first-time mothers. Therefore, conversely, pregnant women should pay more attention to hygiene and physical health than usual. The key points of hygiene that pregnant women should pay attention to are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Diet: Diet during pregnancy is extremely important. Although special foods are not required, several foods should be eaten less than usual, such as meat. There are several types that should be eaten more, such as milk, cream, and fresh vegetables, which are rich in vitamins. A small number of foods are best avoided, such as sour, spicy, and alcoholic foods. The diet during pregnancy can be said to require simple foods, clean cooking, reduced protein such as large amounts of fish and meat, increased carbohydrates such as rice and wheat products, sufficient supply of calcium and vitamins, and drinking plenty of water. Meat can only be eaten once a day to save the kidneys' excretion function, and according to modern research, several products of meat have toxic effects during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The amount of carbohydrates should be increased, i.e., more rice or noodles should be eaten, because the fetus needs a large amount of animal starch, which is taken from the mother's body to maintain proper metabolism. The amount of mineral salts such as calcium in the food should be sufficient to meet the needs of the child, especially in the last three months of pregnancy, the pregnant woman herself must also store it for breastfeeding. Teeth often become fragile and decayed, and bone quality softens during pregnancy. Calcium can also prevent toxemia from occurring. Calcium is mostly found in foods such as milk, eggs, and green vegetables. Eating more foods containing vitamins is of great benefit to both the mother and the fetus, so it is best for pregnant women to take calcium tablets and cod liver oil.</p>
<p>(2) Physical Exercise: Must be done every day. Encourage pregnant women to continue their usual household chores and social activities. Walking is beneficial in all stages of pregnancy, but strenuous exercise and competitions should be stopped. If exercise is not possible due to some reason, the limbs can be massaged. Strenuous exercise and long-distance car or train travel should be avoided in the first three months of pregnancy to avoid miscarriage. In the last three months, more rest is needed, and it is best to loosen clothing and lie down for an hour after meals, and it is even better if you can fall asleep.</p>
<p>(3) Cleanliness: The body must be clean, and the perineum is especially important. If you cannot take a warm bath every day, the lower part must be washed frequently with soap. Get up early and go to bed early every day, and breathe fresh air.</p>
<p>(4) Clothing: Must be loose to avoid compressing the chest and waist. In the later stages of pregnancy, the uterus moves forward, causing discomfort. Elastic abdominal bands can be used.</p>
<p>(5) Constipation: A common phenomenon throughout pregnancy. Drink more water and eat more fruits. If these simple methods are ineffective, mild laxatives can be used, but strong laxatives should be avoided. In the later stages of pregnancy, the breasts should be washed frequently to prevent the secretory glands from accumulating dirt and promote development.</p>
<p>(6) Dental hygiene is very important. The oral cavity should be checked frequently for cavities and pus. If there are any, see a dentist for treatment. Any purulent lesions during pregnancy are dangerous, as they can be a major route of infection after childbirth.</p>
<p>During pregnancy, a doctor should be consulted frequently for examination to reduce various misfortunes during childbirth. Check the urine for kidney changes to prevent future complications. Is there beriberi? It is also necessary to pay attention at any time. Having leg disease can affect the heart, and because the heart is not good, there is a risk of danger during childbirth. Even if it is not very serious, it will affect the health of the mother and baby after childbirth.</p>
<p>Hygiene During Confinement</p>
<p>The postpartum period is also called the puerperium, commonly referred to as the "month." In the immediate aftermath of childbirth, the general condition of the puerperal woman is nothing more than physical fatigue. Over time, or showing a rather marked post-partum exhaustion, body temperature is a hundred degrees (32 degrees 7.8 degrees) or higher, it can be considered irrelevant, this especially is common in primiparas. Temperature rise is due to muscle-power of the overwork of the reaction, to the second day is completely gone, its heat is rarely over twenty-four hours. Postpartum temperature rise relationship, beginning is not sure, up to twenty-four hours above is a sign of illness, should be examined by a doctor.</p>
<p>In the second and third days after childbirth, the spirit is generally listless, appetite poor, thus only can enter liquid or easily digestible solid food, but women of robust body, or do not show a weakening of digestive power phenomenon, in the first few days, bowel movements are often constipation, you can take a laxative, bowel movements smooth spirit is cheerful. Vaginal cleanliness: Lochia, is from the reproductive tract in the two or three weeks after childbirth, the liquid flows out of the liquid, initially red, then gradually turns pale red and to no liquid. Vaginal cleanliness is the most important thing in the puerperium, because childbirth especially primiparas, cervical, vaginal, vulva and perineum etc. area, often have some kind of tears of the existence, in addition to the discharge of lochia pollution, very easy to wound infection; therefore within a week after delivery, at least twice daily, with one percent lysol or potassium permanganate disinfectant solution etc. wash it, after coated with one percent red mercury, covered with sterile cotton gauze, and after gauze wet, is required to change.</p>
<p>(2) Breast Disposal: Breast milk is the best nutrition for raising children, so unless there are special reasons, the parturient woman must breastfeed herself. This not only on the child's nutritional point of view, that is, on its own reproductive organs recovery function, but also has a very important role in promoting, breast that is to fill expansion, and should begin breast-feeding, before and after breast-feeding, should be three percent boric acid water or warm open forever wipe clean, such as epidermal stripping or small tears, then after breast-feeding coated with boron paste.</p>
<p>(3) Food and drink, our old habits, for the parturient, must be to take alcohol, vinegar, soy and chicken etc., these three things irritating most intensely, often enough to cause the disease, all official fast. As for the chicken, though should in nutrition, but the whole body during confinement no exercise, difficult to digest. To the first two or three days more poor appetite, you can give the milk bread eggs and other easily digestible food, to a week appetite slightly open you can take chicken juice, but irritating should still be forbidden.</p>
<p>(4) Mental State, women during confinement are extremely susceptible to emotional distress, all movements of joy, anger, sorrow and joy, should be avoided, on the bed within the possible range, make bed exercises, namely to arm leg flexion and extension and up and down, and deep breathing, can help digestion, improve the whole body condition, and can correct because of pregnancy when too Zhang's abdominal muscles and help to restore tension.</p>
<h3>Medical Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Mr. Sifen:</p>
<p>Reading your letter made me very sympathetic to your situation. People all want to live, and those who are sick want to live even more. However, living in this dark society, poor patients simply have no way to seek medical treatment. Although it is said that there are many charitable institutions (such as hospitals and relief centers), most of them are merely superficial decorations, and in fact, they will absolutely not provide benefits to poor patients. To hope that politics can get on the right track, that society can be stable, and that all poor and sick people can receive reasonable treatment, then we can only hope for the "future of the future"! Regarding these issues, they are indeed too complex and cannot be discussed in a short time, nor can they be discussed by us doctors and patients. We can only pull back and discuss what we want to discuss now.</p>
<p>That's right, we are doctors, and we are here to relieve the suffering of patients, but because of the darkness of society, even we feel threatened by the darkness of society. We only need to look at your letter to understand the other corner of the world of medicine. Of course, doctors are also human, and they also need to eat, but the irresponsible attitude and the highly commercial atmosphere not only deter the general patients, but also make us doctors feel very ashamed when we see it. I can anticipate your dissatisfaction with that attitude. And as you said, "In this society, there are too many people like me. And at the same time, it is too difficult for me to obtain the conditions for medical treatment." We often feel that there is a real lack of an institution in society that serves the poor and sick. And our own strength is too weak. Just think about it, your letter was sent on April 28th, and my reply is delayed until now, which is really too late. But I have to tell you that on the one hand, because there are too many letters, and on the other hand, because I am too busy with my own trivial matters, I have to reluctantly delay it. Alas! It's better not to talk about it! We can only do our part and do our own thing. Now let's bring up your questions for discussion!</p>
<p>According to your condition, chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is the most likely. Although the X-ray examination said it was bronchitis, but that doctor advised you to inject vitamin C and glucose calcium, I always thought he was kindly deceiving you, so that you would not be overly frightened by his announcement that you "have tuberculosis", which would affect your entire psychology. However, I have to tell you that having lung disease is not a terminal illness, as long as you can treat it "in time" and find the right treatment. I now hope you go and take an X-ray (taking it at the Sino-American Hospital is cheaper), which may give you a more accurate diagnosis. As for treatment, I think there will always be a way after the diagnosis is made. In addition to the lung aspect, I think you may also have chronic gastritis and stomach prolapse. But maybe there is no real stomach disease, because people with tuberculosis often have stomach symptoms, but in fact the stomach itself does not have any organic lesions.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I must incidentally tell you: We feel that many people who serve in the cultural world have no place to seek medical treatment and are also unable to seek medical treatment, which really has a great impact on the cultural work. Therefore, we are planning to establish a health and welfare association, the purpose of which is to enable everyone who serves in the cultural work to obtain health protection at the lowest cost. Although this work is very difficult, we always hope that it can succeed.</p>
<h3>"Joint Defense Tuberculosis Repelling Agent" — Translation of BCG</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this journal, there was an article by Mr. Liu Yongchun on the production of BCG Chinese naming rights. After reading it, I was very interested. Mr. Liu advocates a combination of sound and meaning translation, and I agree very much. Without considering my own ignorance, I intend to translate it with the three characters "Repelling Agent."</p>
<p>Repelling, pronounced bì, similar to the pronunciation of the letter B, has the meaning of avoiding from afar.</p>
<p>Evil, pronounced as Mandarin si, is similar to the letter C. If pronounced as Shanghai pronunciation, it is very different. In ancient times, evil was considered the source of disease, which is actually today's bacteria.</p>
<p>Agent, pronounced as G.</p>
<p>The above three characters are translated with a combination of sound and meaning. Although not very elegant, they do not have the common problem of general proprietary medicine names being seemingly understandable but not understandable. How does a high-minded person think of it?</p>

<h3>The Position of Manual Arts and Fine Arts in National Education</h3>
<p>— Hu Shuyi</p>
<p>To discuss the position of manual arts and fine arts in national education, we must first clarify the essence of national education. Since the central government issued the outline for county-level organizations, the Ministry of Education has decided to combine compulsory education with literacy education for out-of-school citizens, renaming it "national education." Its goal, in terms of scope, is to simultaneously establish a universal education movement across the country. This movement should align with political and economic construction, striving towards the national construction goal and catching up. In terms of timing, it should adapt to national conditions and local needs, prescribing procedures to eliminate illiteracy in stages nationwide, ultimately fulfilling the crucial task of education construction. From this, we can determine that national education is an educational construction movement within the current stage of national development. Therefore, the spirit of national education is, first, an education that integrates instruction, nurturing, and hygiene. Second, an education that combines children's practical education with adult remedial education. Third, an education that combines school education with social education. However, these three integrated educational systems are all closely related to the manual arts and fine arts subjects. These are elaborated separately below:</p>
<p>(1) A simple analysis of the educational purpose of manual arts reveals three aspects: First, to train labor skills; second, to cultivate creative abilities; and third, to cultivate an interest in production. We know that previous primary school education only focused on the "teaching" aspect and did not consider the three important tasks of "management," "nurturing," and "hygiene" in local self-governance. The current new system of national education, in addition to educating children and adults, also emphasizes the organization of the populace, the cultivation of production skills, and the training of self-defense capabilities. The cultivation of production skills here is entirely an important goal that manual arts education should achieve. As for labor skills and creative abilities, they are closely related to the organization of the populace and self-defense capabilities. Because organizing the populace and implementing self-defense in local self-governance work require centering around the central national school and national schools, it is essential to cultivate the creative abilities and labor skills of every child, every adult, and every woman, reversing the old bad habits of rote learning and learning uselessly. The aim is to enable children and adults educated by national schools to lead social activities and local enterprises, so that the true spirit of national education, which integrates instruction, nurturing, and hygiene, can be realized. In this light, the position of manual arts in national education is of utmost importance! To realize the true spirit of national education, we must value manual arts education.</p>
<p>(2) Since we acknowledge that national education is locally constructive education, in all processes of local construction, utilizing people's innate love of beauty to complete the beautification of local construction is undeniable. For example, beautified urban planning and beautified rural design are ideals and consistent demands shared by everyone. Therefore, to cultivate every child, adult, and woman, it is first necessary to possess the ability to appreciate and recognize beauty, while also cultivating their expression and creation of beauty. This is an important task to complete constructive national education. This important task relies entirely on fine arts education to achieve. This suggests that fine arts education also occupies a vital position in national education. To realize the true spirit of national education, we must also value fine arts education!</p>
<p>Previous primary school education, with its emphasis on intellectual subjects, did not recognize the true educational goals of manual arts and fine arts, thus classifying these two subjects as skill-based, optional, and inconsequential! Of course, under the erroneous conception of manual arts as handicraft and fine arts as drawing, the importance of manual arts and fine arts education was not recognized. Only by thoroughly understanding the true meaning of manual arts and fine arts education can one realize that the position of manual arts and fine arts in national education is by no means comparable to handicraft and drawing subjects. Furthermore, recent primary education in Britain and the United States highly values the educational value of "work" and "expression," and specially establishes workshops and studios in primary schools. This further proves that manual arts and fine arts subjects do indeed possess objective and unique educational value for foundational national education.</p>
<h3>Franz Cizek</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Recommended to all art educators of the city's children</p>
<p>If we only acknowledge that every child is a future adult, and do not acknowledge that children have their own personality, then to discuss children's art is to link it with traditional technical training. Therefore, special, creative children's art will not be found in the children's heaven.</p>
<p>An excellent children's art educator should conduct education under the plan of "let children grow, develop, and mature." This recognizes children's personality, and even recognizes children's art.</p>
<p>Franz Cizek (1865-) is someone worthy of our attention in the modern world of education, for dedicating his life to children's art education in accordance with this ideal.</p>
<p>Cizek was Austrian, born in Leitmeritz on the Elbe River in Bohemia. From the age of nineteen, he moved to Vienna. After graduating from Peitmeritz, he entered the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1885 to study, lodging in the home of a carpenter, where he often came into contact with many children who asked him to draw and color. Cizek not only agreed to their requests, but also provided them with a lot of paper, pens, and paints. He discovered the uniqueness of children's paintings and was amazed. He made a firm vow to research and educate in children's art.</p>
<p>He discovered that children's art does not have the same planning as adults, but that clumsy form does return to the art forms of ancient China, Egypt, Babylon, and black people. This is not only a new discovery in art education, but simply a new life of modern art.</p>
<p>Cizek's usual teaching method was to provide abundant references and appreciation items, as well as material resources. When children encountered difficulties in their own production process and came to him for advice, he only gave encouragement, guidance, and hints, and absolutely did not modify or create on their behalf. Because he was the first person to firmly advocate that art teaching should be based on the creative energy of children. Therefore, he is not only a reformer of children's art education, but also an original creator.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Manual Arts and Fine Arts Education</h3>
<p>— Jin Qijing</p>
<p>Manual arts and fine arts education is a matter of the entire national culture and is by no means a simple teaching tool. The scope of so-called manual arts and fine arts is also by no means just handicraft and drawing. Its meaning and essence are broad, multifaceted, and organic living education; especially in our Eastern nation, which has always emphasized philosophical thought, it is even more important and urgent!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that children's manual arts achievements are not necessarily really applied, nor are they like vocational schools that make practical utensils. The purpose is to exercise children's muscles and bones, to use children's active nature, and to guide them to practice diligence and enlighten their thoughts. It is the same as the purpose of children's fine arts is not to create painters, but to follow the nature of loving beauty, and to train children's appreciation, expression, and creative interest. Therefore, techniques can be ignored, and there is no need to restrict children's free thoughts. The teaching methods must be carefully studied.</p>
<p>Since the purpose of manual arts and fine arts education is not professional training, all teaching equipment can be simple. Whether in the countryside or in the city, we can make do with what we have. Vast fields and narrow cities are places to implement manual arts and fine arts. Moreover, children may need to apply methods of induction to other knowledge subjects, but only labor and love of beauty are unique talents of children. Guiding children to do manual arts and fine arts is like letting them play in the wild. The question is only how to guide them and assist them? For example, children's art should not be copied, but we should have ideals for children to refer to. Suppose when we implement fine arts, it is exactly the Lunar New Year, and the place is a remote small city, then things like setting off firecrackers and playing with paper dragons are the protagonists of the children. If we use these themes to ask them to create, there will definitely be good results.</p>
<p>In short, the implementation of manual arts and fine arts teaching must not be divorced from life and environment. This is the only important point.</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Exhibition of Manual Arts and Fine Arts Achievements</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>The city-wide children's manual arts and fine arts achievements exhibition, organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, has been in preparation for several months, and has held preliminary exhibitions in various districts. After re-selection by experts, the official exhibition was held simultaneously at the first and second central schools, Tonghui Primary School in the fifth district, and the central school in the third district for three days. All works of more than 20,000 pieces can be said to be magnificent. This is a representative work of the wisdom of 400,000 primary school students in the city, and also the product of the painstaking guidance of more than 1,000 manual arts and fine arts teachers in the city. In such a grand exhibition, in the minds of colleagues who have always been engaged in art education, it is undoubtedly a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>Our colleagues in art education had an organization to promote art education before the war, the Chinese Arts and Education Society. For the promotion of art education activities, we have jointly organized a national children's painting exhibition with the Municipal Education Bureau, the Children's Happiness Society, etc. In terms of design and technology, the Art Education Society has made considerable efforts. At that time, many provinces and cities participated in the works, and a large number of manual arts and fine arts teachers from various provinces and cities came to visit from afar. The impression given to the educational administration authorities, school authorities, art teachers and other parties was quite profound and satisfactory. It was originally intended to be held every year, but unfortunately the War of Resistance broke out, and this plan was suspended.</p>
<p>After the victory, the Art Education Society declared its resumption, but because of financial personnel, no achievements were made, which is very sorry! At the same time, I am also very anxious! We often want to do something that can be done. Therefore, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Education Bureau to organize the manual arts and fine arts exhibition, we consulted with Mr. Shen Yichunqiu and Mr. Wang Jinshan to publish a special issue of the manual arts and fine arts exhibition, and asked several experts to write articles to explain the significance of manual arts and fine arts education, so that everyone will pay attention to it. At the same time, it also expresses congratulations on the success of this children's manual arts and fine arts exhibition.</p>
<p>Many colleagues from the Art Education Society also participated in the preparation work of this manual arts and fine arts exhibition, as well as the re-selection work and the review and evaluation. We have also contributed our spirit and strength, and we should represent all colleagues in the art education circle to pay our sincere gratitude to the educational administration authorities for this very meaningful instruction!</p>
<p>Manual arts and fine arts education has a significant and profound meaning in the entire education. In today's issues, it has been said in great detail. Our hope for the manual arts and fine arts exhibition is: from now on, the school authorities should always pay attention to manual arts and fine arts education, at least to the extent of maintaining the attitude of preparing to participate in the exhibition. Because we know that in order to participate in the manual arts and fine arts exhibition this semester, the school authorities specially selected manual arts and fine arts teachers with a lot of experience, and spent a lot of money to temporarily enrich the teaching equipment in manual arts and fine arts. This is a good phenomenon. We only hope that everyone will pay attention to it regularly. After a long period of time, the effect of manual arts and fine arts education will naturally be expressed.</p>
<p>I also hope that parents will visit the achievements of your children in manual arts and fine arts, and should abandon the attitude of only paying attention to intellectual subjects and despising skill subjects in the past; you should change your vision and recognize that manual arts and fine arts is the best teaching tool for using both hands and brains and following the nature of children, and no longer prevent children's manual arts and fine arts activities. Then, with the serious attention of manual arts and fine arts education in schools and the importance of families, it can be successfully developed!</p>
<p>I also hope that our manual arts and fine arts teachers will pay attention to the mission we bear. How should we design the manual arts and fine arts education that children like? How can we enable children to gain rich and fulfilling life experiences in manual arts and fine arts work? How can we help children express their own thoughts and abilities? Then we can realize the true meaning of manual arts and fine arts education.</p>
<h3>Playing with the Dragon (One of the Achievements of Manual Arts and Fine Arts)</h3>
<p>— Chen Guoxiong, 11 years old</p>
<h3>The Creativity of Manual Arts and Fine Arts Education</h3>
<p>— Zong Lianghuan</p>
<p>In this Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau-sponsored city-wide primary school manual arts and fine arts achievement exhibition, the preparatory committee and the re-election committee stipulated six selection criteria:</p>
<p>(1) Creativity (2) Authenticity (3) Locality (4) Production significance (5) Scientific significance (6) Educational significance, among which the most important is "creativity".</p>
<p>Why is "creativity" the most important? Because we want to implement child-centered education and life education. We want to let children gain rich life experience, and express their own thoughts and abilities as much as possible; at the same time, we should not just copy the materials prepared by the teacher, so that adults can be satisfied, and consider it to be completed task.</p>
<p>The presentation in manual arts and fine arts subjects is the same as composition, which can allow children to fully express their own opinions. And it must be taught to children in this way often, in order to reach the highest realm. A good composition must be written by the author to express his own views in order to be valuable; if it is all copied, then even if the writing is very vivid, it is not surprising. The achievements of manual arts and fine arts are also the same, and it is most meaningful not to copy other people's works.</p>
<p>We have seen the achievements of the preliminary exhibition of this exhibition. Many schools can pay attention to "creativity", but most of them still use the old method of copying or imitating - some fake achievements are even more unacceptable! Especially in fine arts, seventy-eight out of ten are copied, and the content is mostly adult-centered, which is not suitable for children's needs, so at least half of the achievements are eliminated.</p>
<p>Maybe someone will ask: "Creation is not an easy thing, how can children do it?" That's right! Strict creation is indeed not easy. However, the creation we are talking about is not the creation that scientists or inventors talk about. We are referring to the "educational effect". Dewey regards education as "the continuous reorganization of experience", and the so-called reorganization is the creation in education; Bergson believes that "all life is in constant change, and never maintains the same state and the same form." The so-called transformation is also the creation in education. We make a new thing based on or using old experiences, and this thing is not copied, it is called creation.</p>
<p>How valuable is creation after all? Let's give a few examples to illustrate:</p>
<p>Children A and B each draw a landscape painting. Child A is completely drawn according to the model. The composition, color, and model are similar, and the result is of course good; Child B is sketching a landscape somewhere. The composition and color are only the child's intuitive description, and the technique is not smooth. Of course, his grades are far inferior to those of Child A. But if we look at it from an educational point of view: Child A is just deliberately imitating the model, his mental activity is narrow, passive, and lifeless; Child B has to describe the actual scenery, his mental activity is extensive, automatic and vibrant; its value is of course much higher than imitation. Judging from the technical aspect, Child A is accustomed to plane copying, and the ability to observe and express is certainly not as easy to improve as Child B, so the result must be backward.</p>
<p>For example, children A and B each make a cloth pillowcase. Child A is completely sewn according to the popular style. All the patterns and color schemes are harmonious and beautiful, and the results are of course good. What about Child B? He only has a few simple materials. He has to plan the size, design the decorative pattern, and study the most suitable sewing method. He has to think a lot before making it. Although his achievements are not as perfect as those of Child A in form, the educational value is much higher than that of Child A!</p>
<p>From the above two examples, it can be seen that there is no special difficulty in implementing creative education. It is only necessary for the teacher to find ways to encourage it at any time, give enthusiastic guidance, and do not force children to do adult-centered achievements.</p>
<p>Manual arts and fine arts education should pay attention to "creativity". Not only does education itself have its inevitable reasons, but the social aspect is also very important. All undertakings in our country are not easy to progress; the accumulated habits of "adhering to the old methods" are very deep-rooted. Especially handicrafts, they always lack an original style, so they cannot compete with advanced countries. We want the next generation of workers to be rich in creative aspirations and knowledge, and the education of "creativity" cannot be ignored!</p>

<h3>Visiting Mei Lanfang (2)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>My love of watching plays started in Sichuan after my exile. For a time, I lived in Fuling, where there was a Ping opera house nearby. I had nothing to do during my exile, so I went to see it every night with my young daughter, Yiyin. At first, I was not interested in the red robe entering and the green robe exiting. Later, I gradually felt that this kind of acting method and acting method came from the same source as the composition method of its music, both of which were exaggerated and symbolic expressions. For example, a red face must be a good person; a white face must be a bad person; a colored face must be a martial person; the female character's walking is like walking a tightrope; the male character's walking is like pulling mud feet... All these acting methods are based on the facts and are extremely exaggerated. The faces of kind and upright people are bright and majestic, and may be exaggerated as red; the faces of treacherous and violent people are cold and gloomy, and may be exaggerated as white; the faces of brave and combative people are rugged, and may be exaggerated as colored. The gait of a slender woman can be exaggerated into a line. The striding steps of a dignified man can be exaggerated like pulling mud feet... Because they are all based on realism, it feels strange at first, and then it will feel natural. As for riding a horse, you only need to take a whip, and opening a door only needs to make a gesture, which not only avoids the disadvantages of being long-winded, but also gives the audience room for imagination. I think this is much more clear than realism.</p>
<p>Since then, I have become a fan of Ping opera; but not an opera fan, just like to listen and watch. My daughters are the opera fans. My eldest daughter Chen Bao, third daughter Ning Xin, and youngest daughter Yiyin are all familiar with singing operas after their public affairs and studies. Among them, Yiyin is the most obsessed, and has repeatedly appeared on stage in school entertainment to play the role of Qingyi, and has become an amateur actor. Therefore, the atmosphere of Ping opera in my home is very strong. When we returned, we often took this atmosphere as one of our luggage and brought it back to Shanghai from Sichuan. When we arrived in Shanghai, it happened to be President Chiang's 60th birthday. Mei Lanfang performed a play to celebrate his birthday. We bought opera tickets for 30,000 yuan each and went to the Tianchan Stage to watch. Before the War of Resistance, I only watched him once. At that time, I didn't like Peking Opera, and the impression had long been blurred. During the War of Resistance, I learned that he was unyielding in the occupied area of Shanghai and appreciated himself in solitude; and a friend sent his photo with a beard. I originally admired his skills, and now I admire his personality even more, so I hung the photo on the wall. I wish him good health from afar. At that time, victory was still vague. I thought to myself looking at the photo: It must be fast, how long can people live, I don't know if Mei Lang will be back on stage again, and if I will be blessed to come back and enjoy it! So when I sat in the box seat of the Tianchan Stage and saw Mei Lanfang appearing in the role of Madam Sun in Dragon and Phoenix Auspicious, I hurriedly looked around, patted myself on the back, and checked whether I was dreaming, which made the friends next to me inexplicable, and asked strangely "Don't you like to watch Mei Lanfang"? Later, he continued to perform at the China Grand Theater, and I followed him to watch, watching for five nights in a row. After he finished performing, I went to visit him.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Empire of Perseverance</h3>
<p>— Newsboy</p>
<p>At this time and place, after reading the correspondence from London by Mr. Mao Shuqing, a special correspondent of this newspaper, I seemed to see how a big country was competing with history, and I also seemed to see how noble gentlemen were fighting with tradition. Especially in our difficult society, when extravagant meals and hunger are juxtaposed, and luxury and poverty coexist, we have learned from the reporter's news eye a moving picture of another ancient country, which is really admirable and ashamed.</p>
<p>In order to save foreign exchange, cigarettes, tobacco, photographic materials, and movies can be regarded as luxury goods. Because it is not easy to get porridge and rice, in the most expensive restaurants, no matter how much deposit you have in the Bank of England or how much you have in Ireland, if you want bread, you cannot have dessert. Therefore, gentlemen have to face reality, compress their lives, and have to recognize their responsibilities and fight seriously with smoking addiction, tradition, and all old memories and history for a serious fight and liquidation.</p>
<p>This is why every Englishman knows its meaning. Balance foreign exchange, save on life, and accelerate the rebirth of the "British Empire." Today's suffering can be exchanged for future happiness, which is naturally very cost-effective. Therefore, gentlemen are willing to endure their temper and live their lives in this way, and only seek more happiness for themselves, and are unwilling to seek foreign aid again. The plan to gnaw on other people's bones, and the Labor government's huge budget of 310 million without a fiscal deficit, has finally become the best answer to the Conservative Party's attack.</p>
<p>This kind of perseverance and decisiveness is really a good inspiration for us. No matter what, our society is far more turbulent and unstable than the UK, but the four words on the top of the International Hotel are not the soul of our society. Hundreds of cinemas across the country show films exchanged for gold yuan. As long as you have money, you can use your talent for extravagance and enjoy yourself to your heart's content. Why only bread and dessert? How many people in our society dare to blame foreign students for eating bread and peeling off the hard skin like the old woman in London?</p>
<p>"Sir, you Chinese must have a lot of food!" These words of the London woman are not only addressed to that foreign student, but to all the people of China. If Mrs. Cripps heard about it, she would have blamed the previous enthusiastic fundraising to aid China for being superfluous. Thinking about it, in the juxtaposition of extravagance and poverty, how much have we planned for the future of the country?</p>
<h3>Busy Doing Nothing</h3>
<p>— Hu</p>
<p>A man from Arizona came back from New York, and his criticism of New Yorkers was: never relax, always busy doing nothing. Then, he gave an example to prove it. He said: "A guy came out of the subway and pushed me hard as if the police were chasing him. He rushed across the platform and walked up the steps three steps at a time. I thought he had something important, so I followed him; he ran across the road at a red light and rushed into a park. He fell on a bench all of a sudden, and then quickly got up. Do you know what he did? - He started reading the newspaper"!</p>

<h3>Li Wang's Exile to Zhi – Random Notes on Reading History, Part 5</h3>
<p>— Xiao Dai</p>
<p>After King Wu launched the campaign to conquer the Shang Dynasty, the wars among the Zhou tribes temporarily came to an end. In this stable situation, the Zhou took the Yin Shang as a warning and devoted themselves to agricultural production and the development of industry and commerce. The excellent economic situation enabled the Zhou people to pass through a golden age of one hundred and twenty years.</p>
<p>After King Zhao Xia ascended the throne, the Zhou's ruling position began to show signs of shaking. It is said that when King Zhao Xia was touring the south across the Han River, the boatmen, disgusted with him, loaded him on a glue boat. When they reached mid-stream, the glue melted and the boat broke apart, and King Zhao died. This action carried some meaning of revenge. Later, King Ping moved the capital east to Luoyi to resist the oppression of the Western Quanrong, which was also a clear sign of the regime's decline.</p>
<p>The reason for this change can be analyzed as being due to the development of the new economy since the Western Zhou Dynasty. Economic development (1) corrupted the lives of the upper-class aristocrats and completely lost their ruling power; (2) made the exchange relations between the feudal states close, leading to mutual conquest between the states; (3) gradually raised the status of landlords and merchants, eventually overwhelming the aristocracy and occupying the main position in society. This crisis had been lurking, and it became more acute during the time of King Li Hu. King Li did not clearly see that his ruling power had been weakened to the extreme, while the power of the vassal states in the west, such as Qin, and in the south, such as Chu, was gradually growing and threatening him. He also never considered what methods to use to save this impending crisis and properly inherit this family business. On the contrary, because of his extravagant and dissolute life, he relied heavily on Rong Yigong, who was fond of monopolizing profits and unaware of the great disaster, as his minister, specializing in exploiting the people. At that time, the excellent economic situation corrupted the Zhou aristocracy, while the common people were pressed into the eighteenth level of hell. Their suffering can be imagined. King Li not only did not try to save the people from fire and water, but instead used Rong Yigong's hand to oppress the people, and thus popular resentment was boiling.</p>
<p>The "Guoyu Zhouyu" (Discourses of the States, Discourses of Zhou) has this passage:</p>
<p>"King Li was tyrannical, and the people of the country slandered the king. Duke Shao said, 'The people cannot bear their fate!' The king was angry and obtained a wizard from Wei to monitor those who slandered him. When they reported someone, he would kill them. The people of the country did not dare to speak, and exchanged glances on the road. The king was pleased and told Duke Shao, 'I can stop slander now; they dare not speak.' Duke Shao said, 'This is blocking it. Preventing the people's mouths is more dangerous than preventing a river. If a river is blocked, it will burst and injure many people, and the same is true for the people. Therefore, those who manage rivers dredge them and let them flow, and those who govern the people encourage them to speak... The people's mouths are like the mountains and rivers of the earth, from which wealth and resources come forth. They are like the fertile wetlands, from which food and clothing are produced. From the expression of the mouth, good and bad arise. Doing good and preparing for bad are the ways to enrich wealth, resources, food, and clothing. The people deliberate in their hearts and express it through their mouths, and then accomplish it and put it into action. How can it be blocked? If you block their mouths, how long can you last?' The king did not listen, and so the people of the country dared not speak out. After three years, they exiled the king to Zhi."</p>
<p>Duke Shao's words were very thorough and contained profound philosophy, but King Li did not adopt them. King Li killed a few people who slandered him, and when he no longer heard voices of slander, he thought that the world was at peace, and said with self-satisfaction, "I can stop slander now!" Little did he know that in less than three years, he would be exiled to Zhi by the people.</p>
<h3>Circulation</h3>

<p>Because of the sluggish market, factories and shops are closing down, shrinking, laying off employees, and cutting salaries.</p>
<p>Because of layoffs and salary cuts, life in general becomes more difficult.</p>
<p>Because life becomes more difficult, purchasing power becomes weaker.</p>
<p>Because purchasing power becomes weaker, the sluggish market becomes more profound.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Japan</h3>
<p>— Ke Pei</p>
<p>This is not a nightmare. Just look at the news from various newspapers on the fourth:</p>
<p>"Japan hopes to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States, obtain fishing rights near the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island, and obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan."</p>
<p>It is undeniable that due to mutual suspicion among the Allied countries after the victory, the defeated country of Japan has already risen again. This is chilling for our country, which is close to Japan!</p>
<p>The war ended only two years ago, but the changes in the past two years have been too great. The defeated country of Japan has once again become the economic hub of East Asia. Looking back at China, one of the four major powers, due to the long-term war after the victory, the destruction cannot be rebuilt, and the construction is destroyed again, and it has long been disfigured.</p>
<p>According to a friend who recently came from Japan, "The Japanese are very ambitious. The destruction of the war is a hundred times greater than that in China, but today's Japan has embarked on the road to production." Many people are afraid of Japan's revival. We feel that Japan's post-war revival is necessary, just like people need rest after illness. I agree with Mr. Xie Bingxin's statement on this point.</p>
<p>Even so, we cannot forget this cruel humiliation. Germany after the First World War is a lesson from the past. We must abolish all kinds of rights that go beyond the scope, such as the right to immigrate to Taiwan and the trusteeship of Ryukyu.</p>
<p>In short, it is unnecessary to be afraid of Japan's revival, and at the same time it is useless. Control and restriction are only superficial measures. The fundamental solution is to revive ourselves. Only by relying on our own strength can we eliminate the threat from others.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Beleaguered City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Lan's face, which was always able to maintain superhuman composure on weekdays, had also become paler, but she did not speak, and her eyes remained closed.</p>
<p>"Don't panic, Lan, I will help you into the car!" Zhu Zhaonian, whose emotions were greatly stirred, couldn't help but lean down and say quietly.</p>
<p>Lan shook her head hastily.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian realized that she was afraid that his help would make it possible to transmit the disease. But at this time, how could he take so much into account?</p>
<p>"But we can't trouble others!" He said with a smile: "And my physique is very strong, and I have always been immune to all diseases." As he said that, he immediately bent down, stretched out his arms, and gently lifted Lan and the felt together from the rattan chair.</p>
<p>Several kind-hearted people in the car saw this situation and automatically squeezed together to make a gap about a foot wide and two or three feet long, so that Old Zhu could just lay Lan flat on top of the many luggage rolls and boxes. In this way, being half-leaning and half-lying was at least less strenuous than sitting. Zhang Chang blushed and thanked everyone.</p>
<p>The sound of Fei Fei crying and making a lot of noise came from twenty or thirty yards away, and it sounded particularly clear in the ears of Lan and Old Zhu.</p>
<p>"Call her here!" Lan opened her eyes and looked at Old Zhu, and with great effort blurted out these three words.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian, however, believed that there was no need to let Fei Fei come to say goodbye to her mother at this time, because this would only create confusion.</p>
<p>"The car is about to leave, I think it's better not to call her..." He said very gently.</p>
<p>"No..." An anxious look appeared on Lan's face, "This...this child...is very...very impatient...if she cries too hard...she will...will faint..."</p>
<p>This was something that Zhu Zhaonian had not anticipated. He panicked and turned around to rush out of the crowd. But it was too late. By the time he found Fei Fei, the little girl had already cried to the point of fainting in the arms of the female member who was leading her. Two or three people were anxiously sweating while performing first aid.</p>
<p>"Quick! Quick! Cold towel! Cold towel!" Old Zhu pushed another member desperately, telling him to hurry back to the teahouse to get a cold towel, while hurriedly unbuttoning Fei Fei's clothes, laying her flat on the ground, and giving her artificial respiration himself.</p>
