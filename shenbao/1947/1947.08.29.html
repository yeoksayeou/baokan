<p>〔本報訊〕據洪秘書長蘭友表示：「上海工商團體一再要求增加代表名額，中央已決定加以考慮。大選決如期舉行，一切凖備工作按旣定之程序進行，但因事實上之困難，如八月十五日之確定選民名册，九月十五日之政黨提名等小程序，未必能如期辦理，然此不致影響國民大會之開會日期。關於民靑兩黨要求保證事，洪氏稱：「國民黨願全力協助兩黨進行選舉，但不能予以保證，否則不啻承認包辦大選，同時確亦無力保證。民靑兩黨代表態度甚堅決，但退出大選等言，亦應過重。今日南京之小組會議原定決定此事，因故臨時取消」。</p>

<h3>在首相官邸遊園會上　看波蘭的統治者</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>華沙街頭看不見俄國兵，這是「鐵　」以外的人所想像不到的，我在華沙這一星期當中，祗遇到三次戴紅星帽的俄羅斯小伙子，一次在電軍上，兩次在「麻沙哥斯卡」大馬路上，我並沒發現波蘭人和俄羅斯兵之間的特殊的友館。倒是成羣的波蘭軍隊，和那些戴「　徽」菱形帽的彼蘭軍官，很受人注目。波關軍隊的服裝，很不一致，大抵，倫敦政府所賞賜給他們的「蒙哥馬利裝」，現在已經很少很少。晚上「戒嚴」的時候，都是淸一色的俄國熊貓槍，許多「上等兵」，「一等兵」，「二等兵」，他們的服裝的骯髒破爛，使我想起我們在抗戰末期的艱難情形。</p>
<p>一個不容易得到答案的問題，是到底還有多少俄羅斯軍隊留在波蘭境內？有人吿訴我是廿萬人，有幾位美國人估計，大約是十萬人。如果說，歷史事實的造成是由客觀環境來決定的，那末，史達林和沙皇亞歷山大，都已經認識到波蘭在戰略形勢上的重要。亞歷山大皇帝曾經在維也納會議的時候說過：「誰要反對我，乾脆說好了，我有廿萬大軍屯在華沙，誰有本事來撼動我一下」？我沒有聽見莫洛托夫在巴黎會議說同樣的話，但是誰都明白，北方的大熊，是不曾輕輕放過波蘭的。</p>
<p>現在統治着二千七百萬波蘭人的，是波蘭共產黨，共產黨的英雄皮魯特，現在是波蘭共和國的大總統。皮魯特今年五十五歲，一個鮑嘗過「亡命生活」的革命者，在皮魯特自已寫的傳記當中，他自已說：出身在貧農之家，他的故鄉在盧布林附近的農村，年輕時候，他是有名的「學生運動」的首腦人，許多人呌他作「罷課的製造者」。第一次歐洲大戰以前，波蘭在俄，德，奧三國分割的鐵　之下，皮魯特組織了一個強有力的學生團體，在列寗革命以後，這一個團體就和俄羅斯的共產黨有了聯絡。</p>
<p>大概就從那個時候開始，皮魯將成爲一個國際的共產黨黨員，一九二二年，波蘭在畢蘇斯　領導下，完成了復國運動，皮魯特因爲親，對那時候的獨立政權不滿，他爲了許多介紹俄國新經濟制度的小册子，因之被捕入獄。</p>
<p>六個月的牢獄生活，迫使皮魯特流亡到莫斯科，一直到一九三二年才回到波蘭，接着又是被捕，判了七年監禁，一直到第一次大戰　發。有人說：在這段期間之內，皮魯特並沒有過　圄生涯，他是被莫斯科派充到西班牙，做人民政府軍隊的「政工」人員，有人問過皮魯特，他堅決不承認這回事。反正，在那一段期間，波蘭人從來沒聽到過他的名字，　的名字出現在波蘭，是從「波蘭民據委員會」在蘇俄正式成立那時候開始。</p>
<p>一九四四年元旦，皮魯特當選波蘭民族委員會的主席，那年七月，波蘭軍隊配合俄羅斯軍隊，從東綫踏入波蘭領土，皮魯特在那年的七月廿二日，發表了所謂波蘭復國運動宣言，現在成爲波蘭的新的國慶日，後來盧布林政府成立，倫敦政府合併，乃至於大選，淸黨，一幕接一幕的好戲，皮魯特都是直接的領導者。</p>
<p>皮魯特有一副英俊的臉相，一直到現在，許多窮鄉僻壤的許多淳樸的「鄉曲」，他們還不知道皮魯特是彼蘭的什麽人，華沙城內許多被目爲一反動」的彼蘭人。他們時常偸偸的咀咒幾下，他是什麼東西，配做波蘭的大總統？麻沙哥斯和大馬路上，有一家大商店的經理吿訴我，波蘭現在成了強盜世界，從前終年坐在牢監的亡命之徒，現在都做了政府的要津。事後我才知道，共產黨政權現在正計劃加徽商店的重稅”他們計劃用「合作制度」來替代私有的商業資本。</p>

<h3>走私問題的再檢討</h3>
<p>中港緝私協定，原定本月廿三日公佈，後以英鎊停兌美元之影響，港方尙須加以計議，其公佈遂至延期。各方對此，頗致懸念。良以走私問題，港粵間最爲嚴重，而非得港方之切實合作，未易獲致進一步的解決。</p>
<p>自外匯改制以後，關於走私的根本原因，業已消除了大半，這問題的嚴重性，似較前爲和緩。但日貨的秘密輸入，到處已有發現；而且外匯一項，除了官價，市價以外，黑市也並未絕跡。　　黑市匯價，與市價距離過遠，則走私依然有利可圖，便不難死灰復燃，重見昔日猖獗的現象。何况外匯的管制，雖經放寬，而進口貿易的嚴密限制如故，其未獲許可輸入的貨品，與雖經許可輸入而以限額關係仍感供不應求的貨品，又誰敢保證其不故態復萌，仍以走私爲唯一解決的途徑，</p>
<p>所以中港協定，在防北走私問題中，雖屬重要的一環，但並不能完全消滅這個問題。也就是說，這項協定，不問牠能否迅速實施，我們仍應盡其在我，從速爲切實的而且全面的改進。</p>
<p>從各地海　當局的表示看來，目前緝私的困難，約有四點：一爲人員—尤其是熟練的人員—的不敷；二爲器械和船隻的缺乏；三爲待遇的過低：四爲私商背景太濃厚：甚至有武裝力量在支持：而港粵的地理關係，不過其中主要原因之一。所以要切實杜絕走私，很明顯地，不能完全依賴他人的合作，而必須發揮自我力量，從多方面，加以改善與充實，庶乎有濟。現在緝私和處罰辦法，政府已訂有專條，其罰則不可謂不嚴，其人員待遇和工具等困難，亦俱不難加以克服。我們所認爲最大的困難，倒不在乎以上各點，亦不在乎中港協定的能否迅速實　，而在於人事問題，卽在上的主管者，能否整飭紀律，有否鐵面無私的大魄力這一點。</p>
<p>昭過去的情形，凡是從事走私的，並不限於不肖奸商，其中很多私貨，或竟是由公的機　走漏出來的。而協助緝私的力量，不論海上，陸上，或空中，有時或竟相反地幫助走私，包庇走私。假如這種風氣，不能痛痛快快地加以澈底的改變，試問徒具禁令，縱有禁止走私的人員與工具，於緝私上，又有何益？縱使提高待遇，厚其廩祿，又豈足以抵償其舞弊之所得？</p>
<p>我們並不是說，凡屬人員，待遇，工具等等問題，不須解決，而楚說，其中核心問題，斷然在於紀律。必須信賞必罰，厲行獎懲，凡是于犯法紀的，不問其是何身份，具何背景，一槪盡法懲治，不稍寬假，使人人知道國法之可畏，與走私之可爲而不可爲，而後一切制度與工具方纔有用。孟子有言：「徒法不能以自行」。現在日本的私貨，已逐漸發現，北方甚至傳有大量到貨，是走私問題，又已進入一新階段了。希望負責當局急起直追，認眞防維，勿以頒佈若干官樣文章，一紙緝私命令，爲盡其能事，更勿以中港協定終將實施而過於自寬。須知緝私事件，不過財務行政中的一種正如稅吏舞弊中飽一般，賢明的主管當局，理應負起全責來，加以主動的控制，和切實的整頓。尤須排除一切困難，與腐惡勢力奮鬥。倘任其明目張胆地破壞關章，耗减國稅，危害整個的民族工業，而依舊熟視無睹，或不痛不癢地說幾句「正在極力設法」等空話來搪塞，這不能不說是現在政治上的一種恥辱！</p>

<h3>孫越崎視察阜新煤礦　據稱東北用煤大部賴此電源不足現日產四千噸</h3>

<h3>波蘭的統治者　上文續第一版</h3>
<p>「今年」月　會大選以後，皮書特當選之波　的正式大總統。英美政府曾經對那一次大選提出過嚴重的抗議，抗議共產黨操縱選舉，妨碍人民的選舉自　，而且不承認那次選出的議會。皮魯特宣誓就職那天，外交　席上，沒有美國大使勃　斯萊。波蘭政府的共產黨官員，到現在這時刻記　　這件事。據說：皮魯特就城以後若干天，又公宴了一次各國駐波蘭的外交使節，那次，勃累斯備却應邀到座，事後有人間美國大使，爲什麽典禮不到？吃飯却來？勃累斯萊回答得很巧妙，他說：「我們沒承認他做正式大總統，吃飯是承襲他的臨時大總統的老身份來的」！</p>
<p>我沒有打聽現在美國是否已經承認了皮魯特的「身份」，反正，勃累斯萊是早已回美國去了，新任美國大使格力夫，一個相當樂天派的美國資本家，他的汽軍是華沙市內最漂亮的點綴之一，看見中國朋友，會翹起大姆指稱讚葆近甫代辦的「撲克」打得頂好。波蘭人相當歡喜這樣的外交官，特別是在美·蘇關係微妙演變中的今天。</p>
<p>不管　細今天在　織　裏的實際上的地位，如果總迷從外表來看，波蘭現在的中央政府，是一個具有「民主」驅　　政府，一院制的立法體系，責任內　制的行政機構，在今年一月普選前夜，波關臨時政府曾經舉行過曰次國民總投票，　詢國民對憲法的意見，那次總投票，列舉三個問題：第一，你是否贊成國會曰院制？第二，你是否贊成波蘭實行土地改革？第三，你是否贊成波蘭開拓西部疆界，獲得德國鄂得河流域的土地？波蘭共產黨在那次總投票時期。發動所謂「三是」運動，波蘭話說「是」呌做TAK，一直到現在，華沙街頭運到處看見牆壁上遺留的3XTAK的共產黨的標語．</p>
<p>在強有力的異國武裝掩護下，共產黨進行那些爭取羣衆的基層工作，自然是無往而不利的。彼蘭的國會和內　，都如理想一致的實現了，現在的波蘭內閣是一個「聯合內閣」，國務總理崔蘭克微契，一個三十六歲的「禿頭少年」，波蘭社會黨左翼的健將。在我沒有讓崔蘭克微契的傳記以前，我猜度這個年靑宰相，大約是五十上下的人物，他的頭頂「牛山濯濯」，而且發亮，高個身段，見人有一副誠懇的感覺。我到華沙第三天，正碰上波蘭的新國慶，波蘭外交部國際宣傳處，寄給我一張崔蘭克徵契的請東，那天下午，我在帕來茲第姆塞街四十六號的「首相官邸」，看見了這位禿頂首相，他穿一身黑禮服，自襯衫，和碧眼金髮的首相大人，在大廳門口接待賓客。</p>
<p>那天「遊園會」上，大約有五百位國際的和波蘭的賓客，國曾議員·部長。次長及至司長，那天幾乎都到會，葆近甫代辦替我介紹了很多波蘭政府的人物，可惜的是我不會說波蘭話，用法文談天，我祗够凑合幾句，一深談便要「露馬脚」，英語在波蘭，戰前被認爲相當「不恥」，現在雖然觀念改變了，華沙城內說英語的，簡直鳳毛麟角。</p>
<p>我欣賞的，倒是首相官邸廳大的花園，碧茵芳草，大理石堆砌的噴泉，小橋，乃至於潺潺流水，五有個客人分散在花國的四方，並不見得太擠。據說：這是戰前沿襲的首相官邸，波蘭的「唐寗街十號」，華沙大焚燒的日子，首相官邸並沒有嚴重的被破壞，戰後經過稍稍修葺，又恢復了舊觀。</p>
<p>崔蘭克微契在求學時代便參加了波蘭社會黨，他和皮魯特總統一樣，年靑時代是學生會的主席。一九三五年，崔蘭克徵契廿四歲，被社會黨任命爲克拉考城的支部書記，從此以後，他在社會黨裏邊，便逐漸顯露頭角。納粹征服波蘭以後，崔蘭克微契是地下工作的首腦，一九四一年被捕，被拘禁在渥斯威西姆的集中營、一九四五年，又被押解到德國西邊曼肅森城，後來被美國軍隊所釋放。</p>
<p>四年集中營「鐵窗」風味，是今天崔蘭克微契的政治賭資，這不僅證明他是一個堅強的反法西斯主義者，而且在集中營中，使他有機會組織了不少「同難」，他組織了波關人民納粹集中營同難聯合會，這人數就多得可觀，他是聯合會的會長。</p>
<p>一九四五年，崔蘭克微契的「左派」，因爲獲得其他方面力量的帮助，在波蘭社會黨內部，逐漸發生作用，他當選了社會黨的秘書長，而且當選了一九四五年在混亂局面下的波蘭國民大會的副主席，去年十一月底。他被總統任命爲國務總理，組成了現在的所謂「波蘭聯合內閣」。（八月二日於華沙）</p>

<h3>英帝國代表一致主張　澈底解除日武裝　日本國外權益應予廢棄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿八日廣播：參加不列顚聯邦對日和約會議之英自治領國家八單位，均主張完全解除日本武裝。據該會發表公報稱：關於解除日本武裝之討論，已於今晨完成。全體代表感認爲日本應繼續完全被解除武裝，所有軍火製造，應予完全禁絕，國內治安由非軍事警察維特。各代表並詳細硏究各種步驟，務使日本無法參加原子能之硏究與發展。各代表提議日本應放棄在國外之一切權利與利益。</p>
<p>〔路透社康白拉廿七日電〕官方宣布：英共和邦之日本和約會議，於討論剝奪日本之帝國屬領在戰略上及經濟上之影響後，今日已開始討論撤除日本軍備，並解除其武裝之問題。英國駐日佔領軍總司令勞勃生中將，英外部助理次官丹寗，加駐日外交團團長諾曼，澳駐遠東委會代表普拉卓爾，均會就盟國占領下日本之經濟社會軍事政治發展，以及佔領終止後之展望，發表意見。其中勞勃生中將曾特別提出警吿，謂日人雖與盟軍服從地合作，然其和平意向之誠意，尙不可給予過高之估價。其他代表對於勞氏之懷疑日本之誠意，亦均表示同感。官方文吿繼謂，和約土地條款之討論，因有開羅·雅爾達·彼茨坦等宣言存在，爲之簡單不少。盟國就遠東委會之基本政策及其他決策，已有根本原則之協議，日本領土原均係島嶼，故在和約中決定日本之疆界並無困難。波茨坦協定曾規定日本主權應僅限於本州·北海道·九州·四國·四島及其他若干小島，故和會祗須決定何稱小島應繼續置於日本主權之下。討論之際，曾特別提及此等土地之變更，可使日本被剝奪陸海空軍基地及若干重要原料之控制權，故對於防止日本之再侵略，殊有供獻云。</p>

<p>旋由谷部長正綱致詞，略謂去年蘇北之災爲政治災，性質爲人爲的；今年則爲不可抗力之天災。本人對此極表同情，決本去年救災之熱忱盡力。中央對此事極爲重視，故賑災撥款在各省中爲數最多。</p>
<p>決定救災原則</p>
<p>政院對救濟蘇災，已決定原則數項：（一）已遭水淹之地區，儘速疏導；未遭水淹者盡力預防，（二）災民應留在災區，防其流散各地，以便進行工賑；（三）儘速恢復耕種；（四）災區進行防疫工作。惟災情旣甚嚴重，中央二百八十億之急賑，等於「千里送鵝毛」，故必須發動社會力量救災，更有賴於上海之偉大同情。繼由霍寳樹。徐寄廎。在寳暄等相繼致辭，均認爲災情嚴重，災區面積之大，等於荷比盧森堡三國面積之總和，災民之衆等於上海市民之總和，治標須大家盡力，治本則爲政府之責任。</p>

<h3>浙贛路的脈管　金華江大橋　費時六閱月　動工五萬人　試車成功</h3>
<p>〔金華江工地廿二日訊〕會因橋樑工程浩大，延擱浙贛路釘道工作達五閱月之金華江大橋，刻因該路橋工處之加緊搶修，已於前月底卒底於成，並於七月廿九日初度試車，經過成績甚爲圓滿。記者前次趁參觀金衢段釘道工程之便，順逗該處作一日之勾留，承該橋主任工程師張琮佩曁工程師張憲淸諸氏帶領視察全橋一週，訪得初步印欽如下：</p>
<p>按金華江大橋建造於民國廿一年，爲浙贛鐵路前身</p>
<p>杭江鐵路</p>
<p>車輛所經，全長凡二百八十二點九四公尺，依「PG」式（Plate　Givder）圖樣構造，橋身凡十二孔，載重量按E四〇級設討，爲當時杭江路頂大橋工之一，（按是時錢江大橋尙未建造），民國三十年六月間，爲配應浙贛綫撤退計劃，由我方自動將其炸燬，計橋座一，橋墩五悉化爲廢墟，自此，浙贛綫金華以西各段乃全部中斷通車。　勝利後浙贛路曾奉命趕修，金華江爲頂大橋工之一，乃不得不提早準備，是故杭諸段修復，諸金段開始釘道之日，該橋即動工修築，由唐山畢業之張琮佩</p>
<p>老工程師</p>
<p>主其事，並由王繼良，張憲淸，趙昌諸工程司輔其成。本年二月間，依照周開封氏所繪之圖樣，開始勘測，並即着手趕修各個橋墩，工程依次分圍坡，排水，淸理，灌灰四項，時間約自二月十日至四月底日夜工作，每日動工人數在五百人以上，總工數達三萬餘工，橋工處所耗經費據當時計値達五億五千萬元。厥後，橋座完成，即開始第二步工作，即架橋工程，步驟亦分四種，初爲製架，次爲吊架子，三爲架上鋼樑，末方從事修繕橋面。此項工作時間計自四月底起至七月二十日止，每日動工人數在二百至四百間，總工數亦達一萬以上，橋工處所耗經費亦達五億餘元。至七月底橋墩，橋面工作已全部完成，並經數度試車，無何異象，乃臻功成。其所未了工程，僅橋面中間二通護軌，曁各橋架間之塗油敷漆工作，記者參觀該橋工程日，尙餘百餘工人在埋頭趕工。預計此項</p>
<p>防護工作</p>
<p>不出週內，亦可竣工。</p>
<p>該橋位於金華江下浙，距蘭溪約四十華里處，距金華車站凡四公里許，浙贛路自杭至此恰計一七五·九八四公里，江床寬度約與橋長偕等，兩岸平田千頃，柏樹萬千，　　則白帆點點，木排片片，風景至爲優美，橋座東首有橋頭堡壘　，屹峙河岸，雄姿逼人，沿橋步行而過，但見江流滾滾，震人耳目，橋面設安全站八處，供車經時避臉用。其中P1P2P3P4四座均用上承式鋼板樑，P4P11改用坎拿大洋松架就之</p>
<p>巨型木梁</p>
<p>此為該橋特殊點之一。</p>
<p>目前金衢道料車每日數班均由此經過，直抵龍游，不日即可直達衢州而與衢饒段銜接，自此，浙贛綫杭饒段四百餘公里，便可一日抵達。</p>
<p>竣工後之金華江大僑全景（黄岑寄）</p>
<p>今天，假如說我們認爲錢江大橋是浙贛路的靈魂的話，我們也得承認金華江大橋是條浙贛路主要脈管，因爲靠了它，徧枯了近五年的交通綫，從茲又復甦起來了。（黄岑）</p>

<p>最近本市油價漲風再起，民食調配委員會副主委任顯羣，日前與經濟部中植油廠洽商維持拋售辦法，已有結果。昨晨豆油廠盤未開，而各方吸胃甚濃，略見漲勢。中植汕廠乃規定每一食油零售商，可申請配售二十担凈生油，價格每担九十九萬元，共計配出三千担。該項生油係中國食油公司，由靑島運滬，售與中植油廠者，每簍計重二市担。首批六千祖，已由該廠起卸，此項拋售辦法，暫維持至本月杪，等待當局新辦法。</p>
<h3>杭市茶價上漲</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州廿八日電〕外匯新辦法實施後，茶價普遍上漲。此間茶葉市塲行情，雖步漲不已，而交易未見活躍，因市上底存，由於今年產量稀少，本已稀薄，經旬來洋莊大量搜買後，益形空乏，即有存貨者，亦未肯脫手，遂造成有行無市現象。</p>
<p>又訊：本市內銷茶，本街店莊客帮等，去化動而不力，惟低檔花色，如陳次祁門陳久次珍眉等，脫手較活，每担比前砌加四五萬元左右，脚地穩固。洋莊茶市，市面異常淸冷。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市況，晨開浮多不寂轉賣，市氣虛軟，午刻忽聞港電報縮，行情即吿回升。四二支藍鳳紗曾叩二千萬關，最後價爲一千九百九十萬元，比週二繼漲一百萬。其他各支組紗一致步升。</p>
<p>布疋回低</p>
<p>昨日棉布市況，初開穩中帶軟，龍頭細布會高至五十一萬。旋以實際需求不旺，且紡建公司龍頭細布，及四君子元嗶嘰均有掛售，人心頓呈平淡，行情遂吿回低。最後龍頭細布價爲四十九萬九千元，比週二步漲一萬五千，詎收後以紗市激昂，塲外喊價高至五十二萬二千元。</p>
<p>又紡建公司照例售布，龍頭細布掛價爲四十七萬五千元，（限染廠家申購），廿支特細布價爲卅八萬八千（配號家），四君子元嗶嘰五十一三萬五千元‘</p>

<p>又全國水泥公會代表奚正修，曾於日前在京會晤全國經委會劉秘書長顧毓瑔，當提出滬工業界希望對一二兩季已得限額外匯，准照，官價結匯之請求。顧氏頗表同情，並允於會晤國行張總裁時，代爲提供意見云。</p>
<h3>國行差進四六三億　市面銀銀趨緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：昨日國家行局票據交換，計差進四六三億，銀根趨緊，物價漲勢已大見緩和。今續據國行發言人談稱：銀根趨緊，已極明顯。一般推測，短期內銀根仍將日益加緊。因最近直接稅與貨物稅，預計又將有二千億元之稅收。在三五日內，即可繳進也。國家行局方面，對于放款，現完全停止。到期款項，正加緊催收。同時商業行莊，每日多餘之頭寸，已與國行洽妥，均將集中國行，由國行給予優厚之利息。又外匯市塲，現甚平定。指定銀行之外匯，仍有供過於求之象。外匯市價短期內，亦不致有何變動，關於經濟檢査方面，昨日起，本市警察局經濟警察，已全部出動，對各處投機市塲，正予以嚴密監視。投機份子，倘再繼續作崇，決難逃法網。預計物價日內即可趨於安定云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日中央銀行差入二六七億元，中國銀行差入九八億元，中信局差入二三三億一元，外商銀行差入一三三億元。直接交換行莊共差出一三九億元，代理交換行莊共差出四五七億元。聞國家行局鉅額差入，係因中信局配售人造絲，紡建售布，中蠶公司出售綢緞，及所利得稅結款等。今日仍有證交鉅額差金須繳，紡建配紗結款等，故一般預測，在月底前，銀根無法轉鬆。昨日暗息喊一角五分。</p>

<p>捲烟回挫</p>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，以連日上漲過巨，買戶心思閒散，市上籌碼充足，市勢遂吿疲軟。最後十支大英烟比廿六日回降九十萬，爲一千四百六十萬元，老刀牌亦跌六十五萬，爲一千一百八十五萬元。其餘華商烟及美貨條烟亦均回小。</p>

<h3>哀錢明熙醫師！</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>前讀時事新報晚刋所載及本埠醫師八會傳觀消息一則，知南京市立醫院外科醫師錢明熙因病人刁榮泰患急性盲腸炎於開刀前施用脊髓麻醉法身故，被法院認爲過失殺人判決徒刑一年六月。哀哉此錢明熙　醫師也！天地不仁，萬物芻狗，生茲亂世，人人自危，是又豈特錢醫師一人之事而己哉！爲文以哀之。</p>
<p>對於此次南京法院之判決正當與否　吾人不欲聞問。對於錢醫師此次是否有無。過失，吾人亦不欲聞問，吾人所欲問者，爲刁榮泰所患之急性盲腸炎是否必須割治！假使此種急性盲腸炎不用手術割治而任其自然變化，是否不致死亡？假使此種急性盲腸炎不加割治即須死亡，則錢醫師之措置實爲正當之舉。至其於手術前採用何種麻醉方法則爲彼個人方面之絕對自由。不但法官無從判斷其得當與否，即如吾輩）對師以米曾身經目睹關係，亦不能謬然加以批評。吾人爲民衆服務，每日所遇病症千奇百怪，變幻莫測。吾人此時惟有根據平者之學識與經縣加以緊急之處置，初不計其事後之結果。假如明知事後可能担負徒刑之責任，則任誰亦不欲以身試法。似此明哲保身之舉固可無損於醫者，然而病家）殆矣。蓋天下間正不知有多少千千萬萬之急性病者需要吾人之緊急處置。假如爲醫者皆不願以身試法而坐視不救，則正不知有多少病者因此而束手待斃耳。然而此豈國家創設法律所以維護人民生命之本意哉？方今庸醫充斥，殺人於不知不覺之間者不知凡幾。初不問當局設法加以取締，反爾加以放縱，不聞不問。是又豈得事理之平哉？</p>
<p>嗟乎！聖人不仁，百姓芻狗，，錢明熙醫師已矣。吾輩爲醫師者其改行爲三指測脈一紙談醫之人乎？</p>
<h3>漫談兒童之「口渴多尿病」</h3>
<p>— 王爵榮</p>
<p>近三年來，每逢盛夏，各院兒科及私人門診每多一種兒童流行病，其顯著症狀有四：一，爲高熱經久不退。二，爲口渴。一一三，爲多尿。四，血中淋巴性白血球增高。患者多為幼意，預後雖佳，但治療殊不易，茲將三年中對本症硏究所得，錄刊於後：</p>
<p>原因：完全不明，主發於五歲以下之幼童，尤以乳兒及未滿兩歲爲最多。</p>
<p>其傳染多由於直接與病者接觸，患者並無免疫性，再度罹之者不少，且有連發三年者。</p>
<p>流行多在夏季炎熱之時，至秋凉而减少。</p>
<p>傳染素質：以淋巴腺質及患有扁桃腺肥大或體格衰弱，營養不良之兒童最易傳染本症，傷風未愈亦易感染。</p>
<p>本症大多由直接與患者接觸而感染，有一家或一弄內數孩先後感染者，病原體是否存在於口鼻之分泌物中，尙屬疑問。</p>
<p>病源侵入門，大致在扁桃腺或鼻之Sinus部。</p>
<p>症候：</p>
<p>潛伏期：平均爲（三至七日）。　前驅期：最初有輕度腹瀉。小便减少色黄，末二日熟度增高（三九，——三九·五），本期約爲三日至五日，即轉入下期。</p>
<p>小便增多期：患兒熱度盤旋於三九·至四〇·之間，口渴突增，雖極燙之水亦不畏燙，因此亦有少數口舌部燙傷者，小便自此數量及次數均激增，每小時可有三四次至七八次，色淸而量多。</p>
<p>平均二十四小時之飲水量爲1600cc.至3000cc.而二十四小時之小便量，且均超過其飲水量20％强，（即每廿四小時小便量爲1800cc.至3600cc.）因小便之超過飲水量，故患兒數日後即呈輕度脫水現象，本期中除高熱不退，飲水及小便顯著增加，無其他症狀，患兒往往精神狀態良好，有嬉戲如常者。</p>
<p>血液檢査：白血球大都增加（12000-15000）但亦有减低者（400-5500），白血球分類，則Lymphocyts大量增加（40％-55%）。</p>
<p>小便檢騐；蛋白質，陰性（或痕跡）。</p>
<p>糖，絕對陰性。</p>
<p>小便培養：亦無結果，作者正計劃以患者之小便及血液作Lnoculation試騐，本期如無合理治療，可能拖延至一個月以上，平均爲四十九天，即臻入治愈期。</p>
<p>治愈期：平均第四十八天起，小便日减，飲水量亦减，三數日後熱度亦漸退而愈。</p>
<p>患兒亦有因天氣驟凉，而提早自愈者，但天氣秋凉後，如忽又轉熱，本症可能再現。（按作者統計天氣之溫度，雖與本症患者之各項症狀往往成正比例，但亦有於初冬罹此症者。）</p>
<p>輕症：亦有小便轉增，寒熟增高一星期到十日即自愈者。</p>
<p>重症：小兒突發高熱，痙攣，脈博頻數，口唇有靑藍症而死亡者，或以治療不當因脫水而呈腦中毒症狀而死亡者。</p>
<p>併發症：本症因無合理治療，致營養失調，治療後併發結核症者，已數見不鮮。</p>
<p>預後：凡經合理治療之患兒，大多秋凉後即行治愈，故本症預後尙屬佳良。</p>
<p>療法：L.Vitamine　B.:注射重量Ｖitamine　B.，並內服Yesat，可增食慾，對本症無大効。</p>
<p>2，Vitamine　B2:無効。</p>
<p>3.Vit.pp.:無効。</p>
<p>4.Vit.c.:注射大量Vit.c，可使熱度减低，但小便量不减，注射停止，熱度依舊。</p>
<p>5.Sulfagroup:可以防止併發症，但對本症無一顯著効力。</p>
<p>６.Penicillin:注射最初之三日熟度可能减低，但小便不减，其後熱度復高，故Penillia亦無顯著効力。</p>
<p>7.Strep　tomycin:作者未曾試過,但據高鏡朗醫師試用之，結果亦認爲無効。</p>
<p>8.冷水浴:每日三次，每次一至三分鐘，對熱度可大量减低</p>
<p>９.覲蘭煎茶：內服法，每日以蠶繭七只至十只煎茶，以代飲料，速服七日後，小便减少，但溫度不减。</p>
<p>10.腦下垂體素注射：每次注射爲0.3cc.即三單位，每四小時注射一次，每三次即可减低不便，但注射停止後六至十小時又復如故，多注射則呈中毒現象。</p>
<p>11.環境療法：最佳，患者抵深山之翌日，熱度漸降，小便漸趨正常，故爲最適宜之療法。</p>
<p>12.冷氣病房：作者正與高鏡朗醫師研究，如能設「冷氣病房」，使室內空氣保持於六十度左右，患者留院，俟天凉返家，定能收効，惜限於物質條件，未能試騐。</p>
<p>結論：本症之有無病源體，至今不明，而致病之因，亦有下列理論四種：</p>
<p>（一）日光關係；因天氣驟熱，幼兒受高熱之日光射照後，即生本症。</p>
<p>（二）賢上腺因受熱而反應。</p>
<p>（三）腦下垂體外圍之發炎。</p>
<p>（四）有病源體，大槪爲一種Ｖirus-filtrant　在溫度至九十度時，即行活躍。</p>
<p>註一：本病之理論，高鏡朗醫師與作者正在繼續分別研究中，各地同道或病家如有與本文不同之症狀，或有特殊之療法，均請賜敎，通訊址：上海市醫師公會轉。</p>
<p>註二：本文係依作者近三年之診病實錄而作，但據高鏡朗醫師表示，患者白血球中之Lsmghocyter有增加至百分之七十以上者，血液中尙有異型淋巴球之發現，故高鏡朗醫師稱之爲「腺性熱」之一種，一併誌之，以供研究，並對高鏡朗醫師診餘硏究之精神，極表欽佩。</p>
<p>俊靑按：王醫師此文甚有介紹之價値，蓋目下上海患此症者甚多，其父若母如能閱讀此文，則亦不無裨益也。予曾遇數例，其琳巴血球亦有高至百份之七十者。屢治不愈，束手無策，厥後改用靜養及改良營養方法，方始逐漸痊愈。高鏡朗醫師以爲腺性熱，予亦有同感，但不知各位同道以為然否？</p>
<h3>流行江南的日本住血吸蟲病</h3>
<p>— 沈落</p>
<p>日本住血吸蟲病Schistosoma　Japonica，流行于蘇南各地，與蘇北之黑執病，雅司病，同爲江蘇省流行之地方病；對日本住血吸蟲病（以下簡稱『血　病』）作積極之防治，尙自近年始，卅五年五月江蘇省衛生處金於流傳日趨嚴重，乃有蘇南地方病防治所之設，以專門辦理血推，鈎蟲等腸寄生蟲地方病，現該所移駐於血　病流行較盛之吳縣木凟鎭。惟現時外界對血　病流行槪况及傳播情形，尙乏深切認識；作者不計文拙，特草本文爲吿社會，俾引起對該病防治之注意，如能拋磚引玉，得蒙先進指正，則不勝榮幸耳。</p>
<p>甲，日本血　病並不是由日本傳染過來的。考日本血　病是一種由于日本住血吸蟲侵入人體的內臟寄“生蟲病，最早爲一九〇四年日本桂田，土屋，籐波三氏所發見；醫學上爲便于稱呼，定名爲「日本住血吸蟲病」以別于埃及血　S.　Haematobium（非洲），門森氏血　S.Mansoni（美洲及西印度)。</p>
<p>日本血　病，在我國也有同樣的發現，一九〇五年即已有病例的報吿；不渦在醫學上的習慣，凡新發見的病名或治療術，藥劑等，往往冠以發見者的姓氏或地名爲稱呼，所以日本血　病，也沿用了這種慣例，在住血　的上面，加上最早發見的地名——日本，爲正式學名。（待續）</p>
<h3>診餘漫談（續完）</h3>
<p>— 吳濟華</p>
<p>奧拍泰純Optarson是有機砒劑和士的年Strychinin（興奮神經劑）的合劑，牠的優點不過是毒性低副作用少，並沒有超特的補力。最近我用Glyderophosphate　compoundLilly（陸千元一針）代替到同樣的功效。國產藥品中也有Tonicol等劑可以應用，所以實在不値得去買牠。</p>
<p>託拿福賜芬Tonophosphan是一種有機性磷製劑，有强弱兩種包裝，功能興奮新陳代謝，滋養神經，促進骨骼發育。但是牠的效力和緩，注射一二十針尙不易見大效。記得在求學時代，因爲攻讀太勤，神經甚是表弱，試用濃託拿福賜芬三四十針，還沒有得到顯著的效果，後來還是靠休養而復元。本藥的代替品有光明藥廠的福世芬Pliosfen，成分據說與德產品相同，價格甚廉，祗三四萬元一盒（十支裝）。我雖不敢擔保福世芬絕對與託拿福賜芬一樣，但是磷製劑總是磷製劑；大概國產藥品與歐美藥品的區別，可以拿搪磁面盆作比仿，歐美貨較爲堅實，鐵坯較厚，外表較爲光滑而國產品則較爲單薄，鐵坯較次，外表難免圖中不足，七高八低，但是面盆總是面盆，家常應用是未嘗不可的。</p>
<p>先靈司保命Spermin　Schering的所以昂，大槪因爲牠是僅有的外國貨。講到司保命，實在已經沒落而應該淘汰。但是因爲社會的敎育程度太低，醫藥常識可以說絕無僅有，所以在外國早已置諸高閣的廢物，在我國市塲上依然有蓬勃的生意。你不見報紙上某某司保命長，某某司保命短，種種曼妙題名，各式新奇廣吿，琳瑯滿目美不勝收。善做廣吿的正可以靠司保命發一筆財，也的確有幾家藥廠是以司保命創業而靠司保命立足的。記得在六七年前，先靈洋行的德經理與我一夕同飯，正當酒興很高的時候，他從懷中摸出一函，敎我閱讀，這信是柏林先靈藥廠科學部寫給他的，上面寫道：「在我們德國，司保命早已沒有人用，因爲華丸刺激素的研究突飛猛進後，司保命的地位已經被蓋世維雄取而奪之，本廠製造臟器浸膏的一部早已結束，但所存廢料尙多。倘然閣下能在中國推銷司保命，我們狠興奮地接受廢物利用的機會。閣下必須知道睪丸是製造男性刺激素的器官，但製成以後即行輸入血液，牠並不是貯臟倉庫所以從睪丸中提取男性刺激素所得實在微乎其微，難獲臨床上功效，病人用後覺得興奮的話，大槪是心理作用罷了，」。我看了狠是慚愧，祇好笑說你們德國人以前也嘗上過司保命的當。由此可知搜購先靈司保命，是與出高價。而收買假古董的瘟生無異。</p>

<h3>美國人看英國經濟危機</h3>
<p>— 正明譯</p>
<p>自大戰結束以來，美國第二遭又面對着另一次英國經濟危機。華盛頓有少數人在議論着這幾樁事實：</p>
<p>英國直到第二次世界大戰爆發時，素來是全世界最大的輸出國家，但因連續九個年頭來，貿易平衡不利於英國，外匯日漸耗竭，特別是美元少得更快。</p>
<p>英國的工業恢復，以及戰爭毀壞工廠的整頓，遠落在預定期限之後；如果再來一個像去年那樣的冬季，那就絕難支持了。</p>
<p>以美國借來的三十七億五千萬美元貸款，到今年年底就要用完了；唐寗街的美元用得眞厲害，單在七月份一個月內，就動用了七億美元。</p>
<p>當首相文德禮在下院站起身來，發表一個和平時代內前所未有的新的嚴峻綱領時，華盛頓也仍舊不加聞問。華盛頓所注意的是文德禮計劃的時效性，是否它只是要求另一筆貸款的前奏曲呢？</p>
<p>現在和緩這筆既存借款的條件的種種準備，已在着手進行中；因為英國已經再度要求重開條件問題的談判，所以美國也要調查英國使用這筆美元借款的帳目了。</p>
<p>英國的局勢已極危急，雖無其他許多歐洲國家那樣的惡劣華盛頓的觀點却認為，英國因為看到他們在美國和加拿大的信用範圍日益縮小，而且他們在二月中所宣佈的出口目標至少短絀了百分之二十，所以英國發動這個危機藉以獲得進一步的美國援助，可能是想借一筆附加的貸款。</p>
<p>英國警覺到目前惡劣的局勢到今年冬季內也許會達到最惡劣的頂點程度，所以現在為了種種出色的政治理由，就先決心將他們的牌攤在桌上了。英國的問題比幾個月前已經清楚顯明得多，那時候佔據着世界舞台中心地位的，是在馬歇爾計劃下的對全歐洲的援助問題。</p>
<p>英國儘有足夠資源可以支持下去，以待馬歇爾計劃之有效實行，這是有事實可以證明的。在某種意味上說來，英國人是已經預見他們將有危機，未雨綢繆，先作準備而已。（譯自新聞週報）</p>
<h3>無稽的挖眼黨</h3>
<p>— 周淵德</p>
<p>近來街頭巷尾，人們爭傳着一個可怖的消息：說有婦人老人幼童，身藏利器，以問訊或借坐為藉口，來挖人的雙眼。並繪聲繪色的說，「某處某家奶奶，因有人要求　息一會，招待進屋，結果那位奶奶被挖掉了眼睛。那人也給逃跑了。又有某處某家的孩子，被挖掉了心肺，某處有人將要挖眼，而被旁人看見了，把那人打了一頓，并立送×局，誰知×局裏會開了後門，把挖眼人放跑了。某處也捉住一人，身藏挖眼利器，什麽竹管筒，彎尖刀，……並且還有××局呌他挖眼的證書。還有某處捉住一人，抄出有挖眼證書……。」越說越無稽，越說越恐怖。在愚民的心裏，打了一個死結。宣傳者，一再加油加醬，說得比親眼目睹還確實……。</p>
<p>於是……在楊思鄉，高昌廟，甚之打浦橋等，連着發生誤打人的新聞，（巳有一死一傷）死傷的是有家庭有正業的人。在曹家渡，又發生誤毆的事情，又是死傷二人，兇手被捕後詢問之下，原來如此：</p>
<p>「對挖眼黨之出現，祗聽人說，均未目睹；當時因聽人喊打，趁一時衝動，參加毆打，因而醸成命案是實……。」</p>
<p>愚人們的口裏，竟把××局，×××府，認為專收「人心」「人眼」的屠塲了。同時也有人說眼睛收去預備造「冷氣原子炸彈」，造來打共產黨……。</p>
<p>又是笑斷了腸子的奇事。</p>
<p>「其實這些事情，根本都莫須有，不知那里傳出來的謠風……。」</p>
<p>上海，有時候，實在荒唐得可以。</p>
<h3>一時的刺激</h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>法文中的Sensation，直譯起來便是「感覺」的意思。但我却以為把它譯成「為一時的刺激」來得恰當。因為我們在這個世界，每一個人都在為「為一時的刺激」而活着。比如一個一貧如洗的人，他唯一的希望便是有錢，有錢的人他更希望有錢，他勞苦，或偷盜，或照目前最時髦的名詞「貪汚」，其目的都是為有錢。沒有錢的眞有了錢，到了眞有了錢的時候，不過在得着錢的那一剎那覺得有點快感，過了那一剎那，也就變得平凡了。因之，有人有了十萬，還想有二十萬，有了二十萬還想一百萬，有了一百萬還想一千萬，永遠的想下去沒有止境。為了什麽呢？為了那一個數目字而感受一時的刺激。依我看來，吃窩窩頭帶鹹菜與吃魚翅熊掌實在沒有什麽區別。魚翅熊掌不過是給嘴一種一時的刺激，吃了後，它變成的大糞並不比吃窩窩頭鹹菜强。但人永遠在找刺激，一時的刺激。記得有一年（一九三五）比京舉行世界博覽會，其中有一種遊戲呌高空鐵道，我看見許多的人愁眉苦臉的下了車，為了好奇我買了一張票跟着其他的人上了車，車開後先慢後急，上下都是用的最高速度，每個坐在車上的人的心，幾乎都要從心腔中跳出來，有的人駭得直嚷，下車後，我問一個同伴，這有什麽意思，他說：Sensation，（為一時的刺激）他說的太對，因為世界上的事沒有一件事不是這樣。（三六·八·十二於青島）</p>

<p>美國的偵探新聞</p>
<p>偵探小說和偵探雜誌可說是美國的獨步出版物，其他國家沒有那麼豐富的材料和戲劇性的描寫。美國人的好奇好新，造就了許多擅長描寫的偵緝人才，這些小說的作家，警務人員佔了極大成份，所以寫了能那么親切入味，圖文並茂，美國著名的偵探雜誌據我讀過的已有二十多種TrueDctecTiveStorlesPoliceGazette在任何報攤上都可買到。美國人所寫的偵探小說，都有事實根據，並非憑空臆造，而且有實地照片，那種材料在當地報紙俯拾即是，祗須加以整理和補充便成為佳　。美國報紙對於本埠新聞極端重視，因為除少數報紙如紐約時報有世界性外，其餘的都是地方報，而且地方報紙也有詳細報導本埠新聞的義務。如果當地出了一件命案，這是何等重大的事，關於全市公民的安全，大家有切膚之痛，報館當地豈可因為暗殺新聞有　淫　盜作用，而不予記載，甚至官憲為了表示自己的治安德政，不令上司知道，禁止當地報紙刊載，那是何等愚蠢的事！上海是出產社會新聞的地方，但是頭等的資料，却在報上佔着末等地位，這是非常可惜的一件事。像沈俊如是頭等的新聞資料，却找遍全上海的報紙，沒有一家有着系統的記載，關於她的照片，過去數十年的艷史，平日生活狀况，生理變態經過，報館應該派出專人去探問她過去的房東，吊查警局犯案的舊卷，訪問與她接近的醫生，訪問她所有的親戚友好，會同警員檢查她一切的私物及來往信札，可以得到很寶貴的資料。美國報紙如何作風呢，他們常期派有新聞記者携帶照相機在街口巷角等候資料。舉一個實例來說，當一名記者踱過一個大旅館時，忽然有一個住客從四十二層樓跳樓自殺，在自殺者沒有落地之前，記者興起照相機拍了一照，隨即趕回將底片交報館的攝影部洗出製版，再趕回旅館及警局查明該住客的身份，自殺起因，平時生活，來往友好，騐屍經過，警局處置，在當天夜報上已有詳盡長篇記載，那種名貴的照片——一個跳樓自殺者墜在半空中——在二十四小時已用航空及電傳分發到世界各地報紙登載了那照片和記載，增加銷數不下數千萬份，合起來還是便宜之至。報紙根本是報道新聞的，當然以新奇為主，不好新奇的人決不看報紙而看皇清經解了。偵探新聞是新奇資料中的代表，像上海最近發生的幾件謀財害命案，既無照片，也無詳細記載，槍斃日戰犯一狼一虎，報上曾經熱鬧一陣，但祗是些膚淺的記載，對於戰犯出身和家庭，犯罪記錄以及被害人親屬生活狀况，都無報道，祗可算是看了一幕沒有情節和系統的戲劇，是何等憾事！（四六）</p>

<h3>The National Economic Council Approves Imposing a National Reconstruction Special Tax Starting at 5 Billion Yuan; President Zhang Indicates Resolve to Stabilize Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the plan for levying a National Reconstruction Special Tax, the National Economic Council, during its meeting on the 28th at noon, based on discussions from the expanded symposium held a few days ago, further deliberated and decided to retain the name "National Reconstruction Special Tax." The target of the levy is Chinese individuals (i.e., natural persons). The objects of taxation are: (1) land and buildings, (2) current deposits, foreign exchange, government bonds, and stocks, (3) gold and foreign currency, (4) movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens abroad, (5) net asset value of sole proprietorships or partnerships, (6) automobiles and ships, (7) machinery, goods, etc. The starting point for taxation is set at 5 billion yuan, to be implemented first in major cities across the country. Nominations will still be made by local public opinion organs, and supervisory bodies will also be established, composed of members from various sectors, so they cannot be regarded as redundant organizations. This proposal will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for revision and formulation in the short term, referencing the original plan, and then sent to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be implemented after the legislative process is completed. This case has been discussed multiple times by the National Economic Council, and an expanded symposium was held to gather extensive opinions, bringing it to a conclusion. In addition to discussing this case, the National Economic Council also discussed three important cases on the 28th: (1) The Executive Yuan submitted the National Government Committee's proposal on consolidating finance, stabilizing prices, and the National Economic Council was instructed to discuss the fourth item, which is to strictly implement economic inspections and prohibit hoarding and speculation, and private price increases. The meeting resolved to hand this case over to the "Economic Reform Plan Formulation and Implementation Methods Price Group" for handling. (2) The Shanghai fuel supply problem, researching methods to prevent coal shortages. The preliminary discussion mentioned the supply and demand situation and the current situation. As for the famine prevention measures, the temporary solution is to find ways to transport 50 tons of coal stored in Kailuan and 40 tons of coal stored in Fuxin to the south. The fundamental solution includes increasing production, strengthening transportation, and protecting ports. After discussion, the meeting approved the principles and sent them to the Executive Yuan for approval. According to a participating committee member, during the discussion of this case on the 28th, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and the National Resources Commission expressed different opinions on transportation issues and criticized each other. (3) The "Implementation Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Regulating the Supply of Yarn and Cloth" submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This case is of great importance and involves the entire policy. Some participants advocated partial control or no management. President Zhang, however, attached great importance to the continuous rise in cotton prices in various regions and expressed his determination to stabilize them, as there was no reason for the price increase. It was resolved to hand this case over to Wang Yunwu, Zuo Juezhong, Chen Qitian, Weng Wenhao, Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Lou Tongsun, Wu Yunchu, Huang Yuanbin, Xiao Zheng, Pan Xulun, Gu Yuzhen and other twelve people for review, convened by Wang Yunwu. The meeting today was chaired by Zhang Qun, starting from 4:00 PM and ending at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Control Yuan Officially Announces Proposals for Political Reform</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Control Yuan officially announced the revised Proposals for Political Reform on the 28th. The proposals were submitted to the National Government by the Control Yuan on June 11th of this year. The full text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the urgent implementation of matters for suggesting political reform, please consider adopting them. We believe that the eight-year war of resistance has caused excessive losses to the country. After victory, it was originally hoped that post-war recovery and construction would proceed smoothly, gradually leading to prosperity and happiness. However, in the past two years, the economy has been exhausted, prices have soared, industry and commerce have declined, disputes have been frequent, society has become increasingly unstable, and the people's suffering has not diminished. This is mainly because the war has not stopped, and the government has been unable to implement all post-war recovery and construction plans, leaving the people without the opportunity to recuperate and thrive. Moreover, the current personnel appointments and administration are not satisfactory, and a small number of illegal officials abuse their power for personal gain, disregarding the country and the nation, leading to the abandonment of principles and increasing hardship for the people. The decline in administrative efficiency and the decline in service spirit are even more obvious. If this continues, the country and the nation will fall into decline after the victory of the War of Resistance. As supervisors, the members of the Control Yuan, examining the current situation, feel endangered and cannot remain silent. In addition to the various national construction matters for which the government already has plans and has issued clear orders for implementation, it is requested that the initial intentions be thoroughly implemented and that practical results be strived for. Here are the proposals for reforms that should be urgently implemented in the general political aspects, which are presented separately as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Severely punish corruption to restore discipline: (1) Those who commit corruption crimes should be dealt with with the most severe punishment. (2) Encourage people to report corruption. (3) To prevent corruption, officials' property registration should be implemented immediately. (4) Strengthen the work of the Political Affairs Officials Disciplinary Committee and the Civil Servants Disciplinary Committee, and promptly establish a Military Officers Disciplinary Committee. (5) The impeachment cases that the Control Yuan has transferred for disciplinary action should be handled promptly by the relevant disciplinary organs according to the law, and should not be delayed, allowing the impeached persons to remain at large. Furthermore, personnel who have been disciplined and suspended from appointment should not be reappointed under any pretext during the suspension period. (6) The cases of malpractice that have been investigated by the Enemy and Puppet Property Investigation Team should be handled according to the law and the results should be announced. (7) The main illegal personnel and merchants involved in the last gold rush and the current grain and food price rush should be punished according to the law.</p>
<p>2.  Practice strict frugality and severely ban extravagance: (1) Continue to implement the frugal measures during the War of Resistance. (2) Strictly prohibit the import and sale of luxury goods. (3) Heavy taxes should be levied on business and private cars, and the issuance of licenses should be limited. (4) To promote frugality and increase administrative efficiency, civil and military officials should stop going to various places for summer retreats.</p>
<p>3.  Local government officials who are military personnel should be replaced by civil servants within a specified period.</p>
<p>4.  The heads of all agencies should absolutely prohibit concurrent positions to focus on their duties.</p>
<p>5.  Regarding the selection of senior government officials, attention should be paid to talents from all regions of the country, and appropriate distribution should be given to avoid one area or family occupying a majority of important positions.</p>
<p>6.  Implement a meritocracy, improve the personnel system, and break the control of factions.</p>
<p>7.  Implement a clear division of powers and responsibilities. Each agency must have a clear set of powers and responsibilities that cannot be changed due to personnel relationships.</p>
<p>8.  Abolish the special local system.</p>
<p>9.  Abolish redundant agencies, lay off surplus personnel, and adjust the organization of various agencies to increase administrative efficiency and save national treasury expenditures: (1) Agencies with the same nature should be merged, such as the various levels of cargo tax bureaus and direct tax bureaus, which should be merged into one tax agency. The Ministry of Food should be abolished immediately, and food administration and land tax should be unified, and the tax agencies and personnel should be greatly reduced. (2) Agencies that are too large, such as the Ministries of National Defense, Economic Affairs, and Finance, and their affiliated agencies, should be appropriately abolished or simplified. (3) Agencies with too many personnel should be reduced, and it is strictly forbidden for responsible personnel to lay off employees while simultaneously hiring new ones. (4) Agencies that are not properly established should be rationally closed and reorganized, and the agencies should have appropriate mergers or affiliations.</p>
<p>10. Enforce the Public Treasury Law to prevent the misuse of public funds and the use of public funds for personal gain and malpractice.</p>
<p>11. Strictly investigate the registration and disposal of the property and materials of various agencies to prevent malfeasance.</p>
<p>12. Improve and standardize the treatment of public education personnel: (1) The treatment of all public education personnel should be appropriately adjusted according to the price index, the salary based on rice system, or other reasonable standards, to ensure that the treatment they regularly receive can guarantee their livelihood. (2) The treatment of personnel in various public transportation, enterprise, finance, and financial agencies, except for those stipulated by the central government, should not be established under false pretenses, otherwise, they should be considered as corruption. (3) No agency may provide special and superior measures for the establishment and employee welfare of its own agency by using its own revenue or the convenience of collecting public funds. (4) Improve the treatment of officers and soldiers and strictly prohibit the malpractice of receiving vacant positions.</p>
<p>13. Tighten fiscal expenditures: (1) Stop paying all unnecessary national treasury expenditures. (2) Strictly prevent the issuance of emergency payment orders. (3) Thoroughly liquidate the use of foreign exchange and punish those who waste it. (4) Tighten all unnecessary agricultural, commercial, and industrial loans and strictly prevent various loans from being manipulated by a few people for profit.</p>
<p>14. Correct the current phenomenon of uneven distribution of wealth and poverty: (1) Collect deposits of domestic citizens in foreign banks and property abroad within a specified period. Collect progressive property taxes within a specified period. (3) Crack down on all bureaucratic capital enterprises and commercial establishments with senior officials as their background. (4) For land tax collection, a minimum exemption amount for all land should be stipulated, and efforts should be made to equalize the tax burden.</p>
<p>15. Strictly supervise financial institutions: (1) The head offices and main bureaus of the four banks and two bureaus should move to Nanjing for office work within a limited time. (2) Strictly restrict the establishment of commercial banks, money houses, and silver firms, and effectively supervise their business operations. Strictly prohibit commercial firms from selling their signs. (3) Crack down on underground banks and brokerage firms. (4) Strictly supervise and restrict the operations of exchanges and all similar exchanges.</p>
<p>16. Restrict the adverse phenomena of economic and administrative division, divergence, and antagonism: (1) The various economic, financial, and transportation agencies must not create their own special systems in terms of personnel and business by virtue of their responsible functions. (2) Localities must not arbitrarily prohibit the export of local products for local interests, regardless of the national situation. (3) The military, economic, transportation, and other agencies must not purchase equipment and materials from abroad directly in the form of foreign debts. All foreign debts since the War of Resistance must be consolidated and unified. (4) There should be effective supervision and management measures for the reserve of all foreign debts. Respectfully, these suggestions are submitted for review and forwarding to the National Government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Appointed Concurrently as Director of the Northeast Headquarters; National Government Issues Official Order</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 99th Day, 1:00 AM] On the 29th, the National Government ordered: Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Headquarters of the National Government Chairman, will be assigned to another position, and Xiong Shihui should be relieved of his current position. Chen Cheng is specially appointed to concurrently serve as Director of the Northeast Headquarters of the National Government Chairman. This order.</p>
<h3>General Election Decided to be Held as Scheduled; Minor Procedures May Be Delayed but Will Not Affect the National Assembly Session; Hong Lanyou Discusses Election Preparations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, "The Shanghai industrial and commercial groups have repeatedly requested an increase in the number of representatives, and the central government has decided to consider it. The general election will be held as scheduled, and all preparations are proceeding according to the established procedures. However, due to practical difficulties, such as the determination of the voter list on August 15th and the nomination of political parties on September 15th, these minor procedures may not be completed as scheduled. However, this will not affect the opening date of the National Assembly. Regarding the guarantees requested by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party, Hong stated: "The Kuomintang is willing to fully assist the two parties in conducting the election, but cannot provide guarantees, otherwise it would be tantamount to admitting to rigging the general election, and at the same time it is indeed unable to guarantee it." The representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have a very firm attitude, but statements about withdrawing from the general election should also be taken too seriously. Today's subgroup meeting in Nanjing was originally scheduled to decide on this matter, but it was temporarily canceled due to unforeseen circumstances."</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang Reports on the Election Process</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, in response to a reporter's question about the government's current preparations for the general election, stated: After the National Government officially announced the various election laws and regulations, the General Election Office immediately followed the regulations, organized election offices in various provinces, and formulated the procedures for various elections according to the election laws and regulations, instructing the election offices to actively carry them out to ensure completion within the time limit. Currently, election agencies in various regions are handling the announcement of the list of National Assembly representatives, and candidate registration will begin on September 1st. He also said: The voting dates for the election of National Assembly representatives will be from October 21st to 23rd of this year, and for the election of legislators will be from December 21st to 23rd of this year, to be held simultaneously throughout the country. Regarding the procedures and methods of voting and the necessary conditions, Dong stated: Voters will receive ballots upon presentation of their voting credentials and will be directed to the polling place by the polling officials. The election this year will be conducted using the ordinary, equal, direct, and secret single ballot method. The necessary conditions are: those who are 20 years old and have none of the following circumstances have the right to vote, and those who are 23 years old and have none of the following circumstances have the right to be elected: (1) Those who have been convicted of crimes against internal order or foreign aggression under criminal law, (2) Those who have served in public office and have been convicted of corrupt behavior, (3) Those who have been deprived of public rights and have not yet been restored, (4) Those who have been declared incompetent, (5) Those who have mental illness, (6) Those who use opium or its substitutes.</p>
<h3>Duanmu Kai Resolutely Declines the Position of Vice Minister of Food and Decides to Participate in the Legislative Yuan Election</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] The Political Affairs Meeting recently approved the appointment of Duanmu Kai as Vice Minister of Food. Duanmu Kai told reporters that he did not intend to accept this appointment. After reading the news on the 27th that the Political Affairs Meeting had approved his appointment as Vice Minister of Food, he immediately sent a letter to President Zhang of the Executive Yuan to resign. Duanmu Kai stated that the government needs his services, and he should do his best, but he feels that he cannot competently fulfill the responsibilities of the Ministry of Food. If there are other suitable jobs, he will consider them. Duanmu Kai admitted that he has already decided to participate in the Legislative Yuan election.</p>
<h3>Three Parties Participating in the Election Decide to Nominate Candidates Jointly</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The nine-member committee formed by the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party for election matters was convened by Wu Tiecheng on the 28th, and the meeting was held at Wu's residence, where they had lunch together.

Xu Fulin of the Democratic Socialist Party and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party spoke, respectively, believing that the most important thing to consider in the general election is the friction caused by the election between the various parties. Therefore, it was decided through discussion that the principle would be for the three parties to nominate candidates jointly, and the details would be discussed at the next meeting. The nomination elections planned by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party are currently being prepared by each party.</p>

<h3>Watching the Rulers of Poland at the Garden Party at the Prime Minister's Residence</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>You can't see Russian soldiers on the streets of Warsaw. This is something people outside the "Iron Curtain" can't imagine. During my week in Warsaw, I only encountered three Russian young men wearing red star caps, once on an electric military vehicle, and twice on "Masakowska" Avenue. I didn't find any special friendship between Poles and Russian soldiers. Instead, the groups of Polish troops and those Polish officers wearing "military emblem" diamond-shaped caps were very noticeable. The uniforms of the Polish troops were very inconsistent. Generally speaking, the "Montgomery suits" bestowed upon them by the London government are now very, very rare. When the "curfew" is in effect at night, they are all uniformly armed with Russian bear cat guns. The dirty and tattered uniforms of many "private first class," "privates," and "privates second class" reminded me of the difficult situation we were in during the late stages of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>A question that is not easy to answer is how many Russian troops are still left in Poland? Some people told me it was 200,000 people, and some Americans estimated it was about 100,000 people. If the creation of historical facts is determined by objective circumstances, then Stalin and Tsar Alexander have both recognized the strategic importance of Poland. Emperor Alexander once said at the Vienna Conference: "Whoever wants to oppose me, just say it outright, I have 200,000 troops stationed in Warsaw, who has the ability to shake me?" I didn't hear Molotov say the same thing at the Paris Conference, but everyone understands that the big bear in the north has never lightly let go of Poland.</p>
<p>The current ruler of the 27 million Poles is the Polish Communist Party. The hero of the Communist Party, Bolesław Bierut, is now the President of the Republic of Poland. Bierut is fifty-five years old this year, a revolutionary who has tasted the "life of exile." In his own biography, he said that he was born into a poor peasant family, and his hometown is a village near Lublin. In his youth, he was the famous leader of the "student movement," and many people called him the "manufacturer of strikes." Before the First European War, Poland was under the iron curtain of Russia, Germany, and Austria. Bierut organized a powerful student group, and after Lenin's revolution, this group made contact with the Russian Communist Party.</p>
<p>It was probably from that time on that Bierut became an international communist party member. In 1922, Poland, under the leadership of Piłsudski, completed the restoration movement. Bierut was dissatisfied with the then independent regime because he was pro-Russia. He translated many pamphlets introducing Russia's new economic system, and was therefore arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<p>Six months of imprisonment forced Bierut to flee to Moscow, and he didn't return to Poland until 1932. Then he was arrested again and sentenced to seven years in prison, until the outbreak of World War I. Some people say that during this period, Bierut did not spend his days in prison. He was sent by Moscow to Spain to serve as a "political worker" in the People's Army. Someone asked Bierut, and he firmly denied it. Anyway, during that period, the Polish people never heard his name. His name appeared in Poland from the time when the "Polish People's Council" was officially established in Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day 1944, Bierut was elected Chairman of the Polish National Committee. In July of that year, the Polish army, in cooperation with the Russian army, stepped into Polish territory from the Eastern Front. Bierut issued the so-called Declaration of the Polish Restoration Movement on July 22 of that year, which is now the new National Day of Poland. Later, the Lublin government was established, the London government was merged, and then the general election, the party purge, one good show after another, Bierut was the direct leader.</p>
<p>Bierut has a handsome face. Until now, many simple "villagers" in many remote areas still don't know who Bierut is in Poland. Many Poles in Warsaw who are regarded as "counter-revolutionaries" often secretly curse him. What is he, worthy to be the President of Poland? The manager of a large store on Masakowska Avenue told me that Poland is now a world of bandits. The exiles who used to sit in prison all year round are now important government officials. Afterwards, I learned that the Communist Party regime is now planning to add heavy taxes to the stores. They plan to use a "cooperative system" to replace private commercial capital.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Resumes Transporting Relief Goods to Communist Areas; Chairman Approves Ten Measures to Ensure Materials Are Effectively Distributed to the People</h3>
<p>[Our City News] The Executive Yuan announced: Since UNRRA proposed strengthening relief efforts in Communist-controlled areas, the transport of relief materials to North China has been suspended for many days pending a response from our government. It is understood that Chairman Chiang has approved ten measures in response to UNRRA's suggestions. The UNRRA Central Committee met this week and, apart from minor technical revisions, has in principle accepted the Chairman's approved measures as a basis for negotiations with the Communists. It is reported that relevant parties are currently in contact with the Communist side based on the principles agreed to by the UNRRA Central Committee. Once an agreement is reached, the transport of relief materials to North China is expected to resume quickly. The ten measures are detailed below:</p>
<p>"Provisional Measures for Distributing UNRRA Relief Materials to People in Communist Areas" (1) The purpose of these measures is to ensure the effective distribution of UNRRA relief materials to the people in Communist-controlled areas. (2) The observation, supervision, and reporting of the distribution of these materials shall be handled impartially, in the same manner as in government-controlled areas. (3) UNRRA, together with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), will closely monitor the delivery of materials to the end-users. If any misuse or non-compliance with UNRRA's principles is discovered, this material supply plan shall be re-evaluated immediately. (4) UNRRA and CRRRA personnel involved in this work shall regularly report to the UNRRA China Office and CRRRA on the distribution, transportation, and use of materials. (5) To enable its personnel to carry out the supervision stage of material distribution, as stipulated in the basic agreement, and to inspect warehouses and distribution stations within the area at any time, UNRRA will strengthen its personnel in the area and insist on their complete freedom of movement. (6) Within the months of August, September, and October of this year, 50,000 tons of materials will be transported into the Communist areas. The types and tonnage of materials shall be limited to those agreed upon by UNRRA and CRRRA. (7) The first month's materials will be transported through the Yantai port. During the period of UNRRA material transport, the government's army, navy, and air force will provide protection for UNRRA materials and personnel. At the same time, the Communist side must absolutely not use the port for any military activities, including prohibiting all ships except UNRRA vessels from entering or leaving the area. The second route for transporting materials is south along the Grand Canal from Tianjin. The above measures apply to the second route as well. (8) The materials transported to Yantai in the first month must not exceed 10,000 tons. If the UNRRA China Office and CRRRA are satisfied with the work in the area (based on reports from their respective personnel), the distribution of materials will proceed according to the established plan. (9) For the second and third months, the transport of materials will be limited to 20,000 tons per month. (10) The Executive Yuan will designate the Ministry of National Defense and CRRRA to consult with UNRRA on detailed measures for supervising the distribution of materials, protecting transportation, and protecting personnel in the area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, UNRRA authorities have proposed a revision to the above-mentioned item 7 regarding "prohibiting all ships and wooden boats from entering or leaving," requesting that our government consider allowing "boats used by the people of the area for their livelihoods to enter and leave." At the same time, they have also requested that the provision in item 8, which stipulates that materials must not exceed 10,000 tons, be increased to 25,000 tons.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 28th] It has been learned that Cleveland stated yesterday before leaving for the provinces that 90% of the UNRRA materials for China have already arrived, with 10% still to be transported. Once the ban is lifted, they will prepare to transport 50,000 tons of materials to the Chinese Communist areas in North China and 38,000 tons to the Tianjin area.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Jointly Decide to Tighten Lending Policy; Stipulate Five Principles to Align with New Foreign Exchange Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Four Banks Joint Treasury held its 351st board meeting on the morning of the 28th, chaired by Zhang Qun. They continued to discuss the unresolved issues from the previous meeting regarding the tightening of lending policies. The government's revised foreign exchange control measures and import-export trade regulations have been announced and implemented, and all original lending policies should be reviewed and adjusted in light of the economic environment to ensure alignment. Five principles were approved as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Re-define the scope of lending and determine the target beneficiaries in accordance with priority: (1) Industries producing and selling daily necessities (including rice, wheat, coal, cotton yarn, cooking oil, sugar, salt, etc.) whose output is unstable or supply is disrupted and urgently need to increase production or accelerate transportation; (2) Basic industrial and mining enterprises whose products are daily necessities and can replace imported goods; (3) Public transportation and utility enterprises lacking working capital; (4) Export trade enterprises whose goods can generate foreign exchange. The above priority principles may be revised at any time based on actual needs.</p>
<p>2.  Strengthen pre-loan investigations and post-loan assessments, and strictly comply with the following regulations: (1) Personnel in charge of handling loans at banks and treasuries must be responsible for conducting pre-loan investigations. If any intentional oversight or concealment is found, they will be subject to disciplinary action depending on the severity of the circumstances; (2) The approved use of loans must be strictly adhered to and cannot be changed midway without approval; (3) Promote regular inspections to assess the effectiveness of loans. If it is discovered that loans have been diverted to uses other than those originally intended or that production performance is poor, the loans will be recalled in advance, and the matter will be referred to the competent authorities for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>3.  The original "Implementation Guidelines for Assisting Production" should be strictly implemented to ensure close coordination with relevant agencies.</p>
<p>4.  For industries producing daily necessities, order-based lending should be used as much as possible to recover goods and assist the government in controlling materials.</p>
<p>5.  All non-essential loans should be suspended, and all maturing loans should be recovered immediately without extension.</p>
<p>[Our City News] According to sources from the Central Bank, the bank recently received a letter from the Secretariat of the Four Banks Joint Treasury stating that the measures for the transitional period of national bank lending after the government's newly established foreign exchange policy was announced have already been discussed and decided in Shanghai and communicated to various banks and treasuries for implementation. The following three points have been further stipulated: (1) All maturing loans must be recovered. (2) Loan applications reviewed by branches should be submitted to the headquarters for approval before processing. (3) Loan applications made directly by local banks and treasuries should be submitted to the headquarters for approval before processing.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Labor Strike Remains at a Stalemate; Public Utilities Employees to Hold Joint Meeting Today; Will Also Demand Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 28th] The Hong Kong labor strike remains at a stalemate. The further conditions proposed by the Chinese Workers' Strike Committee are still considered unacceptable by the employers. The workers' new proposal is to increase wages by 120% (the initial demand was an increase of 150%), with half as basic wages and half as cost-of-living allowances, while retaining the provision for an annual increase of one cent per hour. However, the employers insist on their original proposal, which is to increase basic wages by 20% and establish a system of annual increases in basic wages of one cent per hour up to a maximum of fifty cents. Hong Kong labor authorities are continuing to mediate. In addition, representatives of employees from the five major public utilities in Hong Kong, including tramways, electricity, telephone, gas, and Kowloon electricity, are scheduled to hold a joint meeting on the evening of the 29th to jointly demand improved treatment from employers. The issue of wage increases for technicians in the various public utilities will be raised by representatives of the Chinese Workers' Strike Committee to the employers.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Governor Grantham Makes Remarks in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] The newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, Grantham, recently hosted reporters here and made the following remarks: (1) The Hong Kong strike was purely caused by workers demanding wage increases. He is actively mediating and believes it will not become serious. (2) Regarding the contents of the economic agreement between China and Hong Kong, such as financial cooperation and anti-smuggling measures, technical issues still need to be studied, so it has not yet been announced. (3) After Hong Kong adopts the new system in the future, the number of council members will be 30 for both Britons and Chinese, and their powers will be equal. (4) Trade between Guangdong and Hong Kong is as close as lips and teeth, with close relations, shared interests, and shared harms. Therefore, he is very willing to work together to eliminate all trade barriers. He also stated: In the past, China and Britain fought side by side, sharing joys and sorrows. In the future, they should strengthen unity and continue to cooperate. Grantham did not respond to questions regarding the current economic situation in Britain and the devaluation of the pound. Regarding the issue of the Soviet Union purchasing tungsten ore in Hong Kong, he replied that he had not heard of it.</p>
<h3>China and Central Airlines Fare Increase Not Yet Approved by Ministry of Transportation; Company Officials Say Tickets Will Still Be Sold at Original Prices Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] There are rumors that China and Central Airlines will increase passenger and freight fares on all routes by 100% starting from the 29th due to the sharp increase in gasoline prices. However, according to officials at the two companies' Nanjing stations, this price increase has not been approved, and the stations have not received any notification from the headquarters. They guarantee that tickets for all routes will still be sold at the original prices on the 29th. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Transportation, the two companies have applied to adjust prices because the cost of aviation has increased sharply and cannot be sustained, but the ministry has not yet approved it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City News] According to officials from China and Central Airlines, after the exchange rate with the US dollar changed, all airline equipment was purchased from the United States, resulting in a sharp increase in costs. Therefore, they recently applied to the Ministry of Transportation for permission to adjust prices and, as usual, prepared a list of various prices to be adjusted before sending it to major cities so that it could be implemented immediately upon arrival of the order. The Ministry of Transportation is still reviewing the matter.</p>
<h3>Liu Guangpei, Director of CRRRA Northeast Branch, Dismissed; Embezzlement Cases Handed Over to the Court</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th] Zai Fusheng, Director of the Distribution Department of CRRRA, arrived in Shenyang on the 27th and stated that the embezzlement accusations against Liu Guangpei, Director of the Northeast Branch, have been handed over to the court. Liu has been dismissed, and Deputy Director Nan Bingfang has been promoted to Director.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zheng Daoshu, Deputy Director of CRRRA, who recently returned to Nanjing from Shanghai, responded to reporters' inquiries by stating that the Executive Yuan is establishing a Post-War Rehabilitation Committee after the closure of CRRRA. The organizational regulations are still under review and have not yet been submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The headquarters and branches of CRRRA are gradually closing down. Generally, the business of each branch can be concluded by the end of this year. The three branches in Anhui, Jiangsu, and Henan provinces will be delayed in closing due to the need to handle post-flood relief and rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>Southwestern Railway Trunk Line Actively Surveyed and Constructed</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Bay to Liuzhou Section Surveyed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 28th] The Ministry of Transportation is increasingly active in the construction of the southwestern railway trunk line in the four provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. According to Wu Rongqing, Chief Engineer of the Fourth District Bureau, the entire line from Guangzhou Bay to Liuzhou has been surveyed. The Liuzhou to Yishan section is already open to traffic. The Yishan to Hechi section is being rebuilt. The Hechi, Dushan, Duyun, and Guiyang sections are being actively constructed. To connect the railway from Chengdu to Chongqing, the Ministry of Transportation sent personnel to survey the route entering Sichuan via Zunyi, passing through Chishui, Xuyong, Luzhou, and reaching Chengdu to connect with the Sichuan-Chongqing Railway. The route from Kunming via Yiliang, Shizong, Luoping, Xingyi, Anlong, and Ceheng to connect with the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway is currently considered too long. It is proposed to change the route entering Sichuan via Guiyang. The route will pass through Dading northward to Xuyong, Luzhou, and Chengdu. For Yunnan Province, Zhaotong will be the starting point, passing through Xuanwei, Shuicheng, Dading, Xuyong, Luzhou, and Longchang to connect with the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. This route is shorter, easier to construct, and the Dading area is rich in coal and iron mines, providing many conveniences. Once approved by the Ministry of Transportation, construction can officially begin.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-examining the Smuggling Problem</h3>
<p>The anti-smuggling agreement between China and Hong Kong was originally scheduled to be announced on the 23rd of this month. However, due to the impact of the pound's suspension of convertibility to the US dollar, the Hong Kong side needs to consider it further, and its announcement has been postponed. All parties are quite concerned about this. The smuggling problem is most serious between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and without the practical cooperation of the Hong Kong side, it is not easy to achieve further solutions.</p>
<p>Since the foreign exchange system reform, the fundamental causes of smuggling have been largely eliminated, and the severity of the problem seems to have eased compared to before. However, the secret import of Japanese goods has been discovered everywhere. Moreover, in addition to official prices and market prices, the black market for foreign exchange has not disappeared. If the black market exchange rate is too far from the market price, smuggling will still be profitable, and it may easily revive and return to its past rampant state. Furthermore, although the control of foreign exchange has been relaxed, the strict restrictions on import trade remain the same. Who can guarantee that goods that have not been permitted to be imported, and goods that have been permitted to be imported but are still in short supply due to quota restrictions, will not revert to their old ways and still see smuggling as the only solution?</p>
<p>Therefore, the China-Hong Kong agreement, while an important link in preventing smuggling, cannot completely eliminate this problem. In other words, regardless of whether this agreement can be implemented quickly, we should still do our best to make practical and comprehensive improvements as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Judging from the statements of various customs authorities, the current difficulties in anti-smuggling efforts are approximately four points: First, the lack of personnel, especially skilled personnel; second, the lack of equipment and vessels; third, the low level of compensation; and fourth, the strong background of smugglers, even with armed forces supporting them. The geographical relationship between Hong Kong and Guangdong is only one of the main reasons. Therefore, to effectively prevent smuggling, it is clear that we cannot completely rely on the cooperation of others but must develop our own strength and improve and strengthen ourselves in many ways to be effective. The government has already established special regulations for anti-smuggling and punishment methods. The penalties cannot be said to be lenient, and the difficulties of personnel compensation and equipment are not difficult to overcome. What we consider to be the greatest difficulty is not in the above points, nor in whether the China-Hong Kong agreement can be implemented quickly, but in personnel issues, that is, whether the supervisors have the ability to rectify discipline and the great courage of impartiality.</p>
<p>Looking back at past situations, those engaged in smuggling are not limited to unscrupulous merchants. Many smuggled goods may have been leaked from public institutions. Moreover, the forces assisting in anti-smuggling, whether at sea, on land, or in the air, sometimes even help smuggling and cover up smuggling. If this trend cannot be thoroughly changed quickly, what is the use of simply issuing prohibitions, even with anti-smuggling personnel and equipment? Even if the compensation is increased, and the allowances are generous, how can it be enough to offset the profits from corruption?</p>
<p>We are not saying that problems such as personnel, compensation, and equipment do not need to be solved. Rather, we are saying that the core issue lies in discipline. It is necessary to reward good deeds and punish wrongdoing, strictly implement rewards and punishments, and punish all those who violate laws and regulations, regardless of their identity or background, without any leniency, so that everyone knows the awe of national law and the possibility and impossibility of smuggling. Only then will all systems and tools be useful. Mencius said: "Laws cannot enforce themselves." Now, smuggled Japanese goods have been gradually discovered, and there are even reports of large quantities arriving in the north. The smuggling problem has entered a new stage. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will catch up quickly, earnestly prevent and maintain order, and not issue some perfunctory official documents or a single anti-smuggling order as the full extent of their abilities, nor be too lenient on themselves because the China-Hong Kong agreement will eventually be implemented. It should be known that anti-smuggling is just one type of financial administration, just like tax officials embezzling public funds. Wise supervisors should take full responsibility, take the initiative to control it, and make practical rectifications. It is also necessary to overcome all difficulties and fight against corrupt forces. If they allow them to blatantly destroy customs regulations, reduce national taxes, and endanger the entire national industry, and still turn a blind eye, or utter a few perfunctory words such as "we are trying our best to find a way" to perfunctorily answer, this cannot but be said to be a kind of shame in today's politics!</p>

The Fuxin coalfield is located in the eastern mountainous area of Rehe, extending 180 kilometers in length and 50 kilometers in width. After exploration by the Japanese, the confirmed reserves are 565 million tons, and the undetermined portion is estimated to be 675 million tons. The total reserves should be 1.24 billion tons. After the September 18 Incident, the Japanese actively developed it on a large scale, making it the largest newly emerging coal mine in the Northeast. The mine was taken over on October 1, 1946. After a year of rectification, it has restored the daily output to 5,000 tons (the highest output during the Japanese management period was 15,000 tons). Since August 10, the output has been affected due to the damage of the Beipiao motor and insufficient power supply. The current daily coal output is 4,000 tons. According to our reporter's observation, the mine is a new mine that has not been mined for long, and there is hope for the future. However, the coal quality is poor and cannot be used for coal coking. It can only be used for locomotive boilers and household coal. According to Sun Yueqi, the reporter stated that most of the coal used in the Northeast currently depends on the Fuxin coal mine. Fushun is a large and dilapidated household, only with a false reputation.</p>

<h3>The Ruler of Poland, Continued from Page 1</h3>
<p>After the general election in [Month] this year, Bierut was formally elected as the President of Poland. The British and American governments had lodged serious protests against that election, protesting the Communist Party's manipulation of the election and obstruction of the people's freedom to elect, and did not recognize the parliament elected in that election. On the day Bierut was sworn into office, the American Ambassador Bohlen was absent from the diplomatic corps. The Communist Party officials in the Polish government still remember this incident. It is said that several days after Bierut took office, he held a public banquet for the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed in Poland. This time, Bohlen was invited to attend. Afterwards, someone asked the American Ambassador why he did not attend the ceremony but came to the dinner. Bohlen replied cleverly, saying, "We did not recognize him as the formal president, but came to the dinner because of his old status as the interim president"!</p>
<p>I have not inquired whether the United States has now recognized Bierut's "status". Anyway, Bohlen has long since returned to the United States, and the new American Ambassador, Mr. Griffis, a rather optimistic American capitalist, his car is one of the most beautiful decorations in Warsaw. When he sees Chinese friends, he will raise his thumb to praise Chargé d'Affaires Bao Jinpu's "poker" playing as excellent. The Polish people are quite fond of such diplomats, especially today when the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is subtly evolving.</p>
<p>Regardless of today's actual status in the organization, if one always looks at the appearance, the current central government of Poland is a government with "democratic" tendencies. A unicameral legislative system, a responsible cabinet system of administration. On the eve of the general election in January this year, the Polish interim government held a national referendum to solicit the opinions of the people on the constitution. The referendum listed three questions: First, do you agree with the unicameral system of parliament? Second, do you agree with Poland implementing land reform? Third, do you agree with Poland opening up its western border and acquiring the land in the Oder River basin of Germany? The Polish Communist Party launched the so-called "Three Yes" movement during that referendum. "Yes" in Polish is called TAK. Even now, you can see the Communist Party slogans of 3XTAK left on the walls of Warsaw.</p>
<p>Under the protection of strong foreign armed forces, the Communist Party's grass-roots work to win over the masses is naturally always successful. The parliament and cabinet of Poland have been ideally realized. The current Polish cabinet is a "coalition cabinet". The Prime Minister, Mr. Cyrankiewicz, is a 36-year-old "bald-headed youth", a stalwart of the left wing of the Polish Socialist Party. Before I read Cyrankiewicz's biography, I guessed that this young Prime Minister was about fifty years old. His head is "bare and shining", and he is tall and gives people a sincere feeling. On my third day in Warsaw, I happened to encounter Poland's new National Day. The International Propaganda Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent me an invitation from Cyrankiewicz. That afternoon, I saw this bald Prime Minister at the "Prime Minister's Residence" at 46 Palac Prezydencki Street. He was wearing a black tuxedo, a white shirt, and the blue-eyed and blond Prime Minister greeted guests at the entrance of the hall.</p>
<p>There were about 500 international and Polish guests, members of parliament, ministers, vice ministers, and even directors, almost all attended that day's "garden party". Chargé d'Affaires Bao Jinpu introduced me to many Polish government figures. Unfortunately, I could not speak Polish. I could only manage a few words in French, and I would "show my true colors" in a deeper conversation. Before the war, English was considered quite "shameful" in Poland. Although the concept has changed now, there are very few people in Warsaw who speak English.</p>
<p>What I admired was the large garden of the Prime Minister's residence, with green lawns, marble fountains, small bridges, and even flowing water. Five or so guests were scattered in all directions of the flower country, and it didn't seem too crowded. It is said that this is the Prime Minister's residence inherited from before the war, Poland's "10 Downing Street". The Prime Minister's residence was not severely damaged during the great fire of Warsaw. After some minor repairs after the war, it has been restored to its former appearance.</p>
<p>Cyrankiewicz joined the Polish Socialist Party during his school days. Like President Bierut, he was the chairman of the student union in his youth. In 1935, Cyrankiewicz was 24 years old and was appointed by the Socialist Party as the secretary of the Krakow branch. Since then, he gradually showed his talents in the Socialist Party. After the Nazis conquered Poland, Cyrankiewicz was the head of underground work. He was arrested in 1941 and detained in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In 1945, he was escorted to Münster in western Germany and later released by the American army.</p>
<p>Four years of concentration camp "iron window" flavor is Cyrankiewicz's political capital today. This not only proves that he is a strong anti-fascist, but also gave him the opportunity to organize many "fellow sufferers" in the concentration camp. He organized the Polish People's Nazi Concentration Camp Fellow Sufferers Association, which has a considerable number of members. He is the president of the association.</p>
<p>In 1945, Cyrankiewicz's "left wing", with the help of other forces, gradually took effect within the Polish Socialist Party. He was elected as the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, and also elected as the Vice-Chairman of the Polish National Assembly in 1945 during the chaotic situation. At the end of November last year, he was appointed by the President as the Prime Minister and formed the current so-called "Polish Coalition Cabinet." (August 2nd in Warsaw)</p>

<h3>British Empire Representatives Unanimously Advocate Complete Disarmament of Japan; Japanese Overseas Rights and Interests Should Be Abolished</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, August 28th Broadcast: The eight units of British Commonwealth countries participating in the British Commonwealth Japan Peace Treaty Conference all advocate the complete disarmament of Japan. According to a communiqué issued by the meeting: The discussion on the disarmament of Japan was completed this morning. All representatives believe that Japan should continue to be completely disarmed, and all arms manufacturing should be completely prohibited. Domestic security should be maintained by non-military police. The representatives also studied in detail various steps to ensure that Japan cannot participate in the research and development of atomic energy. The representatives proposed that Japan should abandon all its rights and interests abroad.</p>
<p>[Reuters Canberra, August 27th] The official announcement: The British Commonwealth's Japan Peace Treaty Conference, after discussing the strategic and economic impact of depriving Japan of its imperial possessions, today began discussing the withdrawal of Japanese armaments and disarmament. Lieutenant General Robertson, Commander-in-Chief of the British Occupation Forces in Japan, Mr. Dening, Assistant Under-Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Mr. Norman, head of the diplomatic corps in Japan, and Mr. Plimsoll, Australian representative to the Far Eastern Commission, all expressed their views on the economic, social, military, and political development of Japan under Allied occupation, as well as the prospects after the end of the occupation. Among them, Lieutenant General Robertson specifically warned that although the Japanese are cooperating obediently with the Allied forces, the sincerity of their peaceful intentions should not be overestimated. Other representatives also expressed the same feeling about Mr. Robertson's suspicion of Japan's sincerity. The official document continued to say that the discussion of the land clauses of the peace treaty was simplified a lot due to the existence of the Cairo, Yalta, and Potsdam Declarations. The Allied countries have agreed on the fundamental principles of the basic policies of the Far Eastern Commission and other decisions. The original territory of Japan was all islands, so there is no difficulty in determining Japan's borders in the peace treaty. The Potsdam Agreement stipulated that Japanese sovereignty should be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, the four islands, and some other small islands, so the conference only needs to decide which small islands should continue to be placed under Japanese sovereignty. During the discussion, special mention was made of the fact that changes in these lands could deprive Japan of control of naval, land, and air bases and some important raw materials, thus contributing to the prevention of Japanese re-aggression.</p>
<h3>US Submits Another Note to Soviet Union Suggesting Four-Power Consultation on Korean Issue; Soviet Union Agrees Not to Consult Orally with Korean Organizations</h3>
<p>[United Press International Washington, August 27th] According to reliable sources, United Press International reported on the 27th that the United States suggested in a note to the Soviet Union that the four Pacific nations of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union should jointly resolve the Korean issue, which has become a stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union. It said that the US proposal was not an attempt to return the issue to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that formed the Moscow Agreement and established the US-Soviet Joint Commission, but to convene representatives of the four countries to consider the situation facing Korea today.</p>
<p>The US note was delivered to US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith on the night of the 26th. Undersecretary of State Lovett revealed that the note has been sent out, but he is unwilling to explain its content so far. According to another official source, the United States believed that it would also be wise to hand the matter over to the United Nations before taking this step, but it was finally rejected, believing that it was not yet the time.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Seoul, August 28th] Soviet Chief Representative Shtikov issued a statement today at Deoksugung Palace, expressing his agreement to Major General Brown's opposition on August 12 to conducting oral consultations with various Korean political parties and organizations.

The representatives of the People's Assembly will be nominated proportionally by groups with more than 10,000 members, and will be decided by the Joint Commission.</p>

<h3>Japanese Zaibatsu Break Up Into Smaller Units</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, August 28th] Since the Japanese government banned the concentration of economic power, the companies of the major zaibatsu have been busy reorganizing into smaller units.

<h3>Egypt's Complaint Against Britain: Soviet Union Opposes Brazilian Proposal</h3>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, August 28th] In today's decisive debate in the Security Council on Egypt's complaint against Britain, there may be two surprising moves: one is the Soviet Union's use of the veto, and the other is Colombia's abstention, which will cause Brazil's proposal to fail to obtain the statutory majority and be rejected.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, August 28th Broadcast: The Security Council discussed the Egyptian issue today. Brazil advocated that Britain and Egypt resume negotiations, and six countries expressed their approval, while the Soviet Union firmly opposed it. The Soviet representative said that negotiations would be futile if British troops did not withdraw from Egypt.</p>
<p>[Reuters Lake Success, August 27th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie said that the two Egyptians, Haub and Morman Lai, who twice intruded into the Security Council meeting place to cause trouble, will not be allowed to enter the meeting place in the future. If they try to enter again, they will be handed over to the police for legal action.</p>
<h3>Britain Announces Emergency Plan to Balance Foreign Exchange and Stabilize Domestic Economy; Recent British Trade Deficit Reaches 600 Million Pounds Annually</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, August 27th] The Labor government today announced a reduction in food imports and restrictions on foreign travel to reduce foreign exchange expenditures by 228 million pounds as the first step to balance the 600 million pound foreign exchange deficit. The dollar expenditure saved by reducing food imports is expected to reach 144 million pounds. After the reduction of food imports, it will be supplemented by increased domestic production.</p>
<p>From October 1st, travel abroad for tourism will be completely prohibited, thus saving 23 million pounds in foreign exchange annually. From the same day, the basic gasoline ration for private cars will be completely abolished, and the strict restrictions during the war will be restored, that is, cars will not be allowed to be used unless it is proven that there is a professional need. The foreign exchange consumption of gasoline saved as a result can reach 10 million pounds per year. Commercial travelers going abroad will be subject to strict control, and the foreign exchange approved per day for travelers to Europe will be reduced from the original 10 pounds to 8 pounds. Domestic food rations will be reduced. For example, the weekly meat ration for each adult will be reduced from the original 14 ounces to 12 ounces, which is the lowest ration during the 1941 war, and the additional ration for heavy workers will also be reduced proportionally. Supplementary foods such as canned meat and fish, dried fruits, biscuits, etc. will also be reduced, and some luxury foods will be completely prohibited from import. It is estimated that in the year ending June 30, 1948, the British trade deficit will be between 350 million and 400 million pounds. However, before the announcement of the austerity measures, the British trade deficit with the dollar area had reached 600 million pounds. The proposed savings of 228 million pounds are still far from the shortfall.</p>

<h3>Europe's Demand for US Aid Should Decrease Annually; It is Rumored that the US is Quite Uneasy About Europe's Excessive Demand</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, August 27th] The State Department expressed unease about the rumor that Europe may request more than 29 billion US dollars in loans under the Marshall Plan, and stated today that the European Recovery Program must be reasonable and practical.

Previously, the State Department dispatched the director of the Policy Planning Bureau, Kennan, and Assistant Secretary of State Bonesteel to Paris to present the latest US views on European aid to the Paris Conference. The conference will complete its report by September 1st.</p>
<p>[United Press International Paris, August 28th] Well-informed sources: The United States will notify the European Cooperation Conference on the 28th that the conference's Marshall Plan report is far less satisfactory than the United States expected. The sources also said that US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton and US Ambassador to France Caffery will consult the conference's Comprehensive Committee and ask for explanations of why the report lacks evidence of Europe's desire to help itself.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of malfeasance by the auditors of the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, Speaker Pan expressed the following views to reporters yesterday: When I was in Beijing, I reported the facts reported by Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese-style Wooden Furniture Industry Association, to Minister Yu Hongjun. The matter originally belonged to a local affair, and I was very satisfied that Minister Yu immediately agreed to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter according to law. Moreover, I have always believed in Minister Yu's impartiality, and I believe that he will have the determination to punish corruption this time. Therefore, the case should be handled according to law by the responsible officials, and I really have no need to add anything more. However, in my opinion, corruption and malfeasance are unavoidable in all countries. As long as they are discovered, they should be strictly dealt with, so as to achieve purification and change the atmosphere. In the future, if we want to eradicate extortion and bribery, it may be possible to amend the legal provisions on bribery and acceptance as equally culpable. Those who are forced to pay should be allowed to report the facts to the competent official within three days after the event or after being physically free (within a certain time limit), so as to be exempt from the crime of bribery; otherwise, the punishment should be increased. If this is the case, it will be helpful to curb the corrupt atmosphere of extortion and bribery.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Hexiang, a 30-year-old businessman from Pudong, resides at No. 96, Lane 127, Father Luo Shen Road. Zhang Shi, 48 years old, resides at the same address. The two are being prosecuted by the prosecutor on suspicion of attempted murder. According to the facts stated in the indictment, Zhang Shi had never been married. In 1934, she adopted Zhang Hexiang as her adopted son. Later, because Zhang Hexiang was already of age, she married Gui Zhen, the daughter of Xu Changgen, in November of the year before last. The shameless mother and son disregarded etiquette and had an affair. After Gui Zhen discovered it, she could not help but complain, which caused resentment. The defendant had long harbored the intention to harm Gui Zhen and abused her, forcing her back to her parents' home several times. In February of this year, her father accompanied her back home, which made the defendant even more angry.

<h3>Disastrous Situation: Waiting for Aid Urgently; Jiangsu Provincial Emergency Relief Committee Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Wang Maogong Elected Chairman</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jiangsu Provincial Flood Emergency Relief Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Pudong Building yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Chairman Wang Maogong reported on the causes of the flood in northern Jiangsu and the urgency of the disaster victims waiting for rescue. He also made an urgent request to all sectors of Shanghai to quickly provide disaster relief, saying that rescuing the northern Jiangsu refugees is to stabilize southern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Minister Gu Zhenggang delivered a speech, saying that last year's disaster in northern Jiangsu was a political disaster, which was man-made. This year's disaster is a natural disaster that is beyond human control. I express my sympathy for this and will do my best to provide relief with the enthusiasm of last year. The central government attaches great importance to this matter, so the disaster relief funds allocated are the largest among all provinces.</p>
<p>Decision on Disaster Relief Principles</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan has decided on several principles for disaster relief in Jiangsu: (1) Areas that have been flooded should be drained as soon as possible; areas that have not been flooded should be prevented as much as possible; (2) Disaster victims should remain in the disaster area to prevent them from dispersing to various places, so as to carry out work relief; (3) Cultivation should be restored as soon as possible; (4) Disease prevention work should be carried out in the disaster area. However, the disaster situation is very serious, and the central government's emergency relief of 28 billion yuan is equivalent to "sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away," so it is necessary to mobilize social forces to provide disaster relief, which is more reliant on the great sympathy of Shanghai. Subsequently, Huo Baoshu, Xu Jiqu, and Zai Baoxuan delivered speeches one after another, all believing that the disaster situation was serious and that the area of the disaster area was as large as the total area of ​​the three countries of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The number of disaster victims is equal to the total number of Shanghai citizens. The treatment of symptoms requires everyone's efforts, and the treatment of root causes is the responsibility of the government.</p>
<p>Four Committees Established</p>
<p>Finally, the organization of disaster relief institutions was discussed and decided: (1) Twenty-one standing committee members, including Gu Zhenggang, Xue Dubi, Huo Baoshu, and Shen Baixian, were nominated. (2) Wang Maogong was nominated as chairman, and Shen Baixian and Leng Yu were nominated as vice-chairmen. (3) Wang Baoxuan was nominated as secretary-general. (4) The Standing Committee established four committees: the Fundraising Committee, the Finance Committee, the Work Relief Committee, and the Investigation and Release Committee. Zhang Jia'ao was the chairman of the Fundraising Committee, Du Yuesheng was the chairman of the Finance Committee, Shen Baixian was the chairman of the Work Relief Committee, and Zheng Tonghe was the chairman of the Investigation and Release Committee. The meeting ended at 5:30 p.m., and the first Standing Committee meeting was immediately convened to discuss the practical work implementation methods.</p>

<h3>Estimated to Collect More Than 30 Billion in Home Assistance Subsidies for Volunteers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the registration of volunteers in the city began on the 25th, the Civil Affairs Office has not yet received the exact number of registered volunteers as of yesterday. According to those responsible, it is certain that the city will be able to recruit 3,000 volunteers as scheduled. However, the Civil Affairs Office believes that the recent incidents of selling recruits have had a great impact on registration and is now ordering strict investigation. Regarding the collection of home assistance subsidies for volunteers, in addition to collecting preferential fees of 30,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 150,000 yuan from those who are exempt from military service, a preferential donation will be generally collected from households that do not have recruits to supplement the funds. The preferential donation rate for co-living households (i.e., ordinary households) will be levied in three categories: 20,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan, depending on the household's economic situation. Co-business households (such as shops, companies, factories, and other group organizations) will be levied a uniform 100,000 yuan per household. It is stipulated that co-living households can be exempted from the collection if they have recruits going on expeditions, or have been approved for exemption from military service and paid preferential fees, or are poor and have a certificate issued by the Baojia chief. There are currently more than 800,000 households in the city. Together with the preferential fees paid by recruits who are exempt from military service, a total of more than 30 billion yuan can be collected. The Civil Affairs Office has drafted a plan and submitted it to Mayor Wu for approval at the military service meeting in the coming days, and will then announce its implementation.</p>

Because of this, Linjuan had suicidal thoughts.

<h3>The Artery of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: The Jinhua River Bridge: Six Months Spent, 50,000 Workers Mobilized, Successful Trial Run</h3>
<p>[News from the Jinhua River Construction Site on the 22nd] The Jinhua River Bridge, which had delayed the track laying work of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for five months due to its massive bridge project, was finally completed at the end of last month thanks to the accelerated repairs by the bridge construction office of the railway. It successfully underwent its initial trial run on July 29th. The reporter took advantage of a visit to the Jin-Qu section track laying project to stay at the site for a day. I was led on a tour of the entire bridge by Mr. Zhang Congpei, the chief engineer of the bridge, and engineers Zhang Xianqing and others, and obtained the following preliminary impressions:</p>
<p>The Jinhua River Bridge was built in 1932 as the predecessor of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</p>
<p>Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</p>
<p>Vehicles passed through, with a total length of 282.94 meters. It was constructed according to the "PG" (Plate Girder) design, with a load-bearing capacity designed according to the E40 class. It was one of the largest bridge projects on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road at the time (the Qiantang River Bridge had not yet been built at that time). In June 1941, in order to cooperate with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line retreat plan, our side automatically detonated and destroyed the bridge, turning one bridge seat and five bridge piers into ruins. Since then, all sections of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line west of Jinhua have been completely interrupted. After victory, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was ordered to rush repairs, and the Jinhua River Bridge was one of the largest bridge projects. It was necessary to prepare early. Therefore, the bridge started construction on the day the Hangzhou-Zhu section was repaired and the Zhu-Jin section began laying tracks.</p>
<p>Zhang Congpei, a senior engineer graduated from Tangshan, was in charge of the project, and Wang Jiliang, Zhang Xianqing, Zhao Chang and other engineers assisted him. In February of this year, surveying began according to the drawings drawn by Zhou Kaifeng, and work was immediately started to rush the repair of each bridge pier. The project was divided into four items in order: enclosure, drainage, clearing, and grouting. The time was from February 10th to the end of April, working day and night. The number of workers mobilized daily was more than 500, and the total number of workdays was more than 30,000. According to the accounting at the time, the cost to the bridge construction office reached 550 million yuan. Afterwards, the bridge seat was completed and the second step of work began, namely the bridge erection project. The steps were also divided into four types: initial production, then lifting the frames, third, erecting steel beams on the frames, and finally repairing the bridge deck. The working time for this item was from the end of April to July 20th. The number of workers mobilized daily was between 200 and 400, and the total number of workdays also reached more than 10,000. The cost to the bridge construction office also reached more than 500 million yuan. By the end of July, the bridge pier and deck work had been fully completed, and after several trial runs, there were no abnormal signs, and the project was completed. The only remaining projects were the two protective rails in the middle of the bridge deck and the oil painting and painting work between the bridge frames. When the reporter visited the bridge project, there were still more than 100 workers working hard to complete the work.</p>
<p>It is estimated that this protection work can also be completed within a week.</p>
<p>The bridge is located in the lower reaches of the Jinhua River, about 40 li away from Lanxi and about 4 kilometers away from Jinhua Station. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road from Hangzhou to here is exactly 175.984 kilometers. The width of the riverbed is about the same as the length of the bridge. There are thousands of acres of flat fields on both sides and thousands of cypress trees. Then there are white sails and wooden rafts, and the scenery is very beautiful. There is a bridgehead bunker on the east side of the bridge seat, standing on the river bank with an imposing appearance. Walking along the bridge, you can only see the river flowing, shocking people's ears and eyes. There are eight safety stations on the bridge deck for vehicles to avoid each other when passing. The four P1P2P3P4 are all made of upper-bearing steel plate beams, and P4P11 is made of Canadian pine</p>
<p>giant wooden beams</p>
<p>This is one of the special features of the bridge.</p>
<p>Currently, several trains of material cars pass through here every day, going directly to Longyou. Soon it will be able to reach Quzhou directly and connect with the Qu-Rao section. From then on, the more than 400 kilometers of the Hangzhou-Rao section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line can be reached in one day.</p>
<p>The completed panorama of the Jinhua River Bridge (Huang Cen Post)</p>
<p>Today, if we think that the Qiantang River Bridge is the soul of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, we must also admit that the Jinhua River Bridge is the main artery of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, because thanks to it, the transportation line that has been withered for nearly five years has been revived from now on. (Huang Cen)</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin 26th Dispatch] Yangqiao Township in the Eighth District of our county is separated from Yixing County by only a river. The south of the river belongs to Yixing, and the north belongs to Wujin. The affairs of the people are closely related. Village Head Wang Yi-jian of the aforementioned Yixing jurisdiction has served as village head since the victory and has actively implemented government orders in coordination with military force. He has always been known for his diligence, and therefore he was resented by the communist underground organization "Wuyi Garrison Command" leaders Zhang Zhi-yi and Wu Qi-chang. Because their actions and collection of communist grain could not proceed smoothly, their resentment deepened day by day. On the morning of the 26th, during the bustling market hours, Village Head Wang was in the back room of the Jia Genquan teahouse auditing the conscription resettlement expenses when suddenly two communist bandits, wearing short coats of light gray cooked silk, sneaked into the teahouse. Upon seeing Wang, they pulled out their automatic pistols and shot him directly. Wang was caught off guard and died on the spot.

<p>Minister Zhu Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Minister Zhu delivered the opening speech first, stating that the UNESCO conference was held in London in November 1945, passing the charter of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The following year, in November, the General Assembly was held in Paris, and our country sent representatives to participate. In the following year, UNESCO began its work, and each member state should form a domestic committee to establish contact with UNESCO. Therefore, our country prepared the China Committee. The preparations began between March and April, and the Ministry of Education hired well-known figures from education, science, and culture, such as Zhang Daofan and more than ten others, as members of the preparatory committee to actively prepare. On the 25th of this month, the preparatory committee decided that the first committee would have 120 members, of which 100 would be nominated by academic organizations. The term of office for this session is one year. After the second session, in addition to those selected by the Ministry, the remaining members will be re-elected by the first session's committee, with a term of office of three years. The committee has three tasks: (1) To handle liaison matters between domestic educational, scientific, and cultural organizations and UNESCO; (2) To propose to the government the implementation of work plans related to UNESCO; (3) To handle matters entrusted by the government and UNESCO.</p>
<p>President Dai Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>President Dai of the Examination Yuan then delivered a speech, stating that the meeting was held in the Mingzhi Building, and elaborated on the couplet "Pursue ambition with indifference, achieve distance with tranquility, evolve the human community, and achieve world harmony." He said that Chinese culture has a history of more than 4,000 years. The three dynasties and earlier are far beyond reach. Unfortunately, it was destroyed in the fires of Qin, but Confucius, the sage, revived the extinct. He cited Confucius's three great virtues of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, as well as the six arts, and discussed extensively the past and present, and concluded that Confucius's aim of world harmony and the aim of the Three Principles of the People of the National Father were to seek world harmony through educational, scientific, and cultural cooperation, which coincided unexpectedly. He also elaborated on Chinese education itself and hoped that colleagues in education, science, and culture would work hard. Zhao Nai-chuan, the representative of the Legislative Yuan, elaborated on the great responsibility of the China Committee itself.</p>
<p>Commissioner Hu Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Commissioner Hu Shi delivered a speech, first explaining in detail Article 7 of the UNESCO Charter, "Each member state shall, in accordance with its own circumstances, take measures to ensure that the most important educational, scientific and cultural organizations in its country are linked to the work of the Organization..." He then stated that he had attended UNESCO and proposed that UNESCO hold a meeting in China in 1949 to commemorate Confucius's 2,500th birthday. At that time, he discussed it with the Acting Secretary-General of UNESCO. Fortunately, it was not made a resolution, because the Gregorian calendar year 1949 is not Confucius's actual birthday. The actual birthday is in 1950. Therefore, he deliberately advocated that our government should designate the Academia Sinica and the China Committee of UNESCO to jointly organize the 2,500th anniversary of Confucius, with the participation of people from all aspects of education, science, and culture across the country, as an unprecedented academic and cultural undertaking, without other political implications, and asked UNESCO to come to China for a meeting in 1950. He also believed that the location did not have to be in Nanjing, but could be in Beiping. Commissioners Weng Wenhao, Li Shuhua, Wu Yifang, and Qu Junong then spoke, reporting and expressing their hopes for UNESCO and the organization of this committee.</p>

<h3>Allocation of Goods Worth Over 600 Billion - Price Fluctuations Unlikely to Last - Gu Committee Guarantees Stable Market Prices for Flour and Grains</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In response to recent fluctuations in the market conditions of rice, flour, cooking oil, and other essential commodities in the city, the Advisory Committee on Allocated Goods convened a full-day meeting yesterday with various relevant agencies. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Four Districts Flour Association, China Vegetable Oil Factory, China Food Oil Company, Dayouyu Oil Factory, and others attended. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the arrival of rice, flour, wheat, and other grains has been abundant recently, even more so than in the past. Therefore, the main cause of the recent price fluctuations is public anxiety. There are sufficient reserves of various essential foods, so there is no need for a sell-off. A responsible member of the committee stated that the government currently holds over 600 billion yuan worth of allocated goods in the city. Even if speculative hoarding groups attempt to mobilize floating capital in the market to launch an offensive, they cannot compete with such a large quantity of allocated goods. He also guaranteed that from today onwards, the market prices of flour, grains, and other items will definitely fall.</p>
<h3>Rising Market Trends in the Interior - Both Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Rebound - Flour Mills Jointly Release 40,000 Bags of Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 6,500 shih of rice arrived in Shanghai South and Zhabei. Market trends rose due to high prices in the interior. It is rumored that freight rates will also increase.

New japonica rice followed suit, rising by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour opened strong in the morning. Battleship and Old Car brands once reached 134,000 yuan. At noon, the price slightly decreased due to the joint release of flour by mills, with a total of 40,000 bags released citywide at a price of 130,000 yuan. Half of the release was mixed-brand flour. As a result, standard flour increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, while mixed-brand flour increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Foreign flour remained stable. There are rumors that foreign firms will absorb a large quantity of bran, which continued to rise, soaring by another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake continued to move in Taiwan, increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were firm, actively traded, and continued to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

<p>Recently, the rising tide of oil prices has resurfaced in the city. Ren Xianqun, Deputy Director of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, discussed with the China Vegetable Oil Factory under the Ministry of Economic Affairs the continuation of the selling plan, and an agreement has been reached. Yesterday morning, before the soybean oil factory opened, demand was strong, and prices showed a slight increase. The China Vegetable Oil Factory then stipulated that each cooking oil retailer could apply for the allocation of 20 dan of refined peanut oil at a price of 990,000 yuan per dan, distributing a total of 3,000 dan. This batch of refined peanut oil was transported from Qingdao to Shanghai by the China Food Oil Company and sold to the China Vegetable Oil Factory. Each basket weighs two city dan. The first batch of 6,000 baskets has been unloaded by the factory. This selling plan will be maintained until the end of this month, pending new measures from the authorities.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Tea Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 28th] After the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy, tea prices have generally risen. Although the tea market here has been rising continuously, transactions have not been active. The existing stock in the market is already scarce due to the low production this year. After foreign firms have been buying in large quantities for the past ten days, it has become even more depleted, and those with stock are unwilling to sell, resulting in a situation where there are prices but no market.</p>
<p>In addition, the sales of tea for domestic consumption in the city's shops and tea houses have been slow, but low-end varieties, such as aged Qimen and aged Zhenmei, have been selling relatively well, with each dan increasing by about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the base is stable. The foreign firm tea market is extremely quiet.</p>

<h3>Multiple Parties Entering and Covering Positions - Hua Shares Close at High Prices</h3>
<p>Hua shares continued to be active yesterday. Although No. 224 and other shares, as well as Guangdong shares, came out to sell at high prices, causing a slight dip in the middle, the high opening of off-market interest rates at 2 jiao 2.5 fen and 2 jiao 7 fen caused multiple parties to temporarily release their positions. However, a sudden telegraph report from Hong Kong reported a contraction, causing multiple parties to re-enter and cover their positions. The market rebounded by the afternoon closing, eventually closing at high prices.</p>
<p>The market opened high. Dieyong Yarn opened high at 258 yuan. After the opening, No. 235 and other shares were sold, dropping slightly to 155 yuan. No. 4 and other shares entered, rising to 265 yuan. No. 56 and other shares sold at high prices, retreating to 255 yuan. At this time, because Xinya was listed from No. 149, rising to the daily limit, No. 153 took advantage of the low price to buy and slightly consolidate. In the end, the bulls from No. 104 frequently came out to sell, and No. 186 and others sold, forcing Dieyong Yarn down to 254 yuan. Meiya also saw a large sell-off from No. 224 and also retreated slightly.</p>
<p>After 11:00 AM, No. 171 and others had entered up to 261 yuan, but shortly after, it was sold again by No. 173 and others, dropping again to around 1254 yuan. Later, after the Hong Kong telegram reported a contraction to 11 yuan 7 jiao, yarn prices rebounded, sentiment improved, and No. 171 and others jointly absorbed. Dieyong Yarn closed at 256 yuan and 264 yuan.</p>
<p>After the close, bids were slightly higher, and other shares also rebounded. As a result, compared to Tuesday's closing, on a traded-share basis, Dieyong Yarn, Xinyi, Yonggong, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by half a percent, Zhongfa rose slightly less than one percent, Xinhua slightly declined, Xinhua Feng Meiya slightly rose, Lian was flat, Xinya rebounded after reaching the daily limit, rising slightly less than one percent, underwear fell by half a percent, Zhongs, Tongyi, and Datong fell slightly less than half a percent, and the rest all rose slightly. On a deferred-delivery basis, Dieyong Yarn, Xinyi, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose by half a percent, and Meiya Xinguang Yonggong slightly rose. Off-market old shares were stable, with most slightly rising.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange unchanged</p>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee approved the foreign exchange market price, which remained at the original level. Therefore, the buying and selling prices of US and British currencies by designated banks remain unchanged.</p>
<p>In addition, Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by ship this afternoon.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Hover, Foreign Shares Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, miscellaneous public bonds saw a decline, while Unified C bonds were easy to rebound after falling, showing a hovering trend. Initially active and then falling, the market was uncertain. Unified C opened at 16,800 yuan, retreated from 17,200 yuan to 15,000 yuan, and then struggled around 16,500 yuan. Dachengxing and Room 538 sold, while Room 50111, Room 55, and Room 550 entered, with about 8 million traded. Compared to before the closing, A and B bonds fell by 600 yuan, Unified C rose by 200 yuan, Unified D fell by 900 yuan, and Unified E slightly decreased by 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign shares were peaceful, with a mediocre process. Yi Yarn opened at 92,000 yuan, falling from 92,300 yuan to 90,000 yuan at the closing. Foreign merchants, Guangdong merchants, and Shengda bought, while gold shops, bank groups, and securities groups sold. As a result, compared to Tuesday's closing, the British Union, Jardine Matheson, Yi Beer, and Airlines were all flat, Shipping fell by half a percent, and the rest saw slight increases or decreases.</p>
<h3>Price Evaluation Council Sets Prices for Kerosene and Gasoline</h3>
<p>The Fuel Group of the Price Evaluation Council held its seventh meeting yesterday at the Social Affairs Bureau, chaired by Zhou Weishen. After reporting on discussions with the Transportation Management Committee regarding kerosene foreign exchange matters, the following regulations were made for the price of second-term kerosene: (1) The price of kerosene is 800,000 yuan per barrel, weighing 53 pounds, or 2,300 yuan per catty. (2) The price of gasoline is 1,440,000 yuan per barrel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Fuel Management Committee is scheduled to convene a Civil Coal Allocation Committee meeting at 3:00 PM today. It is reported that in addition to the original Industrial Association, Industrial Guidance Office, and Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Council will also be added as a participating unit.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau's Rayon Sales Changed to Early Each Week</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau's 36th allocation of rayon to the silk weaving industry this week totaled 14,398 packages, or 715 boxes. The 21st allocation of rayon to the ribbon weaving industry totaled 846 packages, or 42 boxes. In total, 775 boxes of rayon were allocated this week. The original schedule of allocating rayon on the 1st and 4th of each week has been changed to allocating rayon on the 1st and 2nd of each week. Payment and pickup are on the 4th, so no rayon was allocated yesterday.</p>
<p>Prices Rise</p>
<p>The market price of rayon yesterday increased by 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous increase, with the final asking price being 7.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>Although yesterday's factory silk transactions were not active, sentiment was firm, and market prices continued to rise. Five packages of zero-grade silk were traded at 32.5 million yuan, an increase of 1.5 million yuan compared to Tuesday. Asking prices for all grades also increased accordingly. The asking price for medium-grade rayon was 30.4 million yuan per load. Due to the rise in factory silk, the asking price for dry-spun silk also rose, reaching 20 million yuan per load, but there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Due to the soaring silk market, silk fabrics had already risen sharply on Wednesday and continued to rise yesterday. The highest immediate price for Huachang Zhensi quilts was 2.8 million yuan, an increase of 1 million yuan in two days. Dachang goods were only 20,000 to 30,000 yuan higher than Huachang goods. Plaid crepe was offered at around 42,000 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>London Announces Sino-British Trade Figures for This Year - Double Last Year's Figures</h3>
<p>[British Information Services, London, 28th] In the period from January to July this year, goods shipped from the Far East and Pacific Islands to the United Kingdom totaled 545,021 tons. During the same period, goods shipped from British ports to the Far East amounted to 600,851 tons, of which more than 80% were British goods. Although these figures are only one-third of the total for the same period in 1938, they have doubled compared to last year and are evidence of the active recovery of trade between Europe and Asia after the war. The total value of Sino-British trade currently exceeds pre-war figures. This is clearly evident from the latest statistics from the British Department of Trade, as shown in the following table, with figures in thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Country 1938 1947 1938 1947</p>
<p>Monthly Average June Jan-June Jan-June Jan-June</p>
<p>From China to UK 594 1920 3569 3666</p>
<p>From UK to China 362 594 2179 5490</p>
<p>Trade statistics between the UK and Hong Kong are not included.</p>
<p>The following table compares the main items and figures for Chinese exports to the UK in July this year, January to July 1938, and January to July this year:</p>
<p>Category 1947 1936 1947</p>
<p>July Jan-July Jan-July</p>
<p>Beverages 4239 156</p>
<p>Oilseeds 793 483 790</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Raw Materials 49 368 1030</p>
<p>Silk and Rayon Yarns 4 81 33</p>
<p>In July this year, tea was the main item of Chinese exports to the UK, totaling 446,020 pounds. The main items of British exports to China are fewer than before the war. The following table compares the main items of British exports to China and their figures:</p>
<p>Category 1947 1938 1947</p>
<p>July Jan-July Jan-July</p>
<p>Machinery 240 591 1367</p>
<p>Iron and Steel Products 443 245 1353</p>
<p>Wool and Wool Products 195 111 1086</p>

<p>Electrical Products 109 29 843</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Goods 117 752 610</p>
<p>The figures for machinery and woolen textiles in July were twice the average for the previous months, and other steel, chemical, and electrical products also saw considerable increases.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Speculation and Stabilizing Prices - Fabric Warehouse Receipts Must Be Sold Within a Time Limit - National and Private Factories Decide to Temporarily Increase Allocation of Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The ninth regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee was held in the committee's meeting room yesterday afternoon. All committee members attended, chaired by Acting Director Liu Siying. The meeting adjourned after discussions lasting until around 7:00 PM. The important resolutions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wang Qiyu, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, Shi Fengxiang, and others proposed a "Plan to promote the export of fabrics to earn foreign exchange and exchange for foreign cotton." It was decided to task Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, and one representative each from the Central Bank, the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the Textile Construction Company to jointly review the plan and submit it to the next meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>(2) Recent fabric market conditions have fluctuated again. In order to crack down on speculative hoarding, effective immediately, fabric warehouse receipts must be sold within seven days. Warehouse receipts exceeding the seven-day limit will not be allowed to circulate in the market and will be dealt with by the Municipal Government's enforcement department. The Textile Adjustment Committee has also sent letters to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Six Districts Cotton Spinning Association, the Yarn Merchant Association, and the Cotton Cloth Merchant Association to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>(3) Recently, the supply of electricity has been insufficient. It was decided that the Textile Adjustment Committee will periodically convene representatives from the city's electricity companies, national and private yarn factories, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, and others to jointly discuss a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to stabilize cotton yarn market prices and increase the supply of cotton yarn, the Textile Adjustment Committee will, in addition to entrusting the China Textile Construction Company to jointly allocate yarn today, also provide some additional temporary cotton yarn for sale by national and private yarn factories. The required cotton yarn for the yarn numbering industry will also be supplied in the same way.</p>
<p>Negotiated Price Adjustment</p>
<p>The negotiated price of cotton yarn has been adjusted since the 25th. The adjusted prices for each count of yarn are as follows: 10-count yarn: 7.1 million yuan, 16-count yarn: 8.97 million yuan, 20-count yarn: 10.2 million yuan, 32-count yarn: 13.5 million yuan, 40-count yarn: 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Rises Steadily</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was active in the morning, with buyers and sellers unwilling to sell, and the market atmosphere was weak. At noon, news of a contraction in the Hong Kong telegram caused prices to rebound. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn once tested the 20 million yuan mark, with the final price being 19.9 million yuan, continuing to rise by 1 million yuan compared to Tuesday. The prices of other yarn counts also rose steadily.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was stable to soft at the opening. First-grade fine cloth rose to 510,000 yuan. However, due to weak actual demand and the listing of first-grade fine cloth and Sijunzi yuan barge by the Textile Construction Company, sentiment turned flat, and prices fell. The final price of first-grade fine cloth was 499,000 yuan, an increase of 15,000 yuan compared to Tuesday. However, after the close, due to the soaring yarn market, off-market bids rose to 522,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, with first-grade fine cloth listed at 475,000 yuan (limited to dyeing factories), 20-count extra-fine cloth priced at 388,000 yuan (allocated to licensed households), and Sijunzi yuan barge at 513,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Remains Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the raw cotton market remained active, with prices rising all the way and transactions brisk. Because cotton yarn rose steadily, customers were in high spirits and had a strong desire to buy. The cargo continued to be popular, resulting in a market price increase of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. About 3,000 packages were traded today. The opening factory price for each grade was 2.1 million yuan for Shashi cotton, 2.1 million yuan for Han fine cotton, and 2.15 million yuan for bundled Duohua cotton.</p>
<h3>Eleven Associations Meet to Demand Official Exchange Rate Settlement</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Eleven industrial associations in the city, including rubber, paper, and cement, held a meeting at the Maorong Textile Industry Association yesterday afternoon. Hong Nianzu, Jin Runxiang, Zhang Shanzhang, Chen Yuanqin, Cai Xintao, Yang Liren, Xi Zhengxiu, Le Jiarong, and others attended. After discussing the current fluctuations in the black market exchange rate, it was decided that the foreign exchange quotas obtained by various industries in the first and second quarters should be settled at the official rate as soon as possible. Jin Runxiang was appointed to arrange a meeting date with Secretary Lin Jikang of the National Bank and representatives from the eleven industry associations. It is reported that the unsettled foreign exchange quotas for the first and second quarters of the eleven industry associations total about US$8 million.</p>
<p>In addition, Xi Zhengxiu, representative of the National Cement Association, recently met with Liu Guanyu, Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, in Beijing. During the meeting, he raised the Shanghai industrial community's hope that the foreign exchange quotas obtained in the first and second quarters would be settled at the official rate. Mr. Gu expressed his sympathy and promised to provide his opinion to President Zhang of the National Bank during his meeting with him.</p>
<h3>National Bank's Deficit Reaches 46.3 Billion - Tightening of Silver in the Market</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that yesterday's clearing of bills by national bank branches showed a deficit of 46.3 billion, and the silver market is tightening, greatly easing inflationary pressure. A spokesperson for the National Bank continued to state that the tightening of silver is very obvious. It is generally speculated that the silver market will continue to tighten in the short term. This is because it is estimated that direct taxes and commodity taxes will generate another 200 billion yuan in revenue, which can be paid within three to five days. The National Bank has completely stopped lending and is accelerating the collection of overdue payments. At the same time, it has been agreed with commercial banks that daily surplus funds will be concentrated in the National Bank, which will provide preferential interest rates. Furthermore, the foreign exchange market is currently stable. There is still an oversupply of foreign exchange at designated banks. The foreign exchange market price is unlikely to change in the short term. Regarding economic inspections, starting yesterday, the economic police of the city's police bureau have been fully deployed to closely monitor speculative markets. Speculators who continue to act will not escape the law. It is expected that prices will stabilize within a few days.</p>
<p>[Further Report] Yesterday, the Central Bank had a deficit of 26.7 billion yuan, the Bank of China had a deficit of 9.8 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 23.31 billion yuan, and foreign banks had a deficit of 13.3 billion yuan. Direct clearing banks had a total deficit of 13.9 billion yuan, and agent clearing banks had a total deficit of 45.7 billion yuan. It is reported that the large deficit of national bank branches is due to the China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon, the Textile Construction Company's sale of cloth, the China Silk Company's sale of silk fabrics, and the settlement of profit taxes. There is still a large amount of clearing funds to be paid today for the Textile Construction Company's allocation of yarn and the settlement of payments. Therefore, it is generally predicted that the silver market will not ease before the end of the month. Yesterday, the underground interest rate was 1 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Registration of Imported Goods Deadline Extended to the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Import and Export Control Committee previously announced that all imported goods shipped before August 16th that have not obtained import licenses must be registered with the committee's registration department (Room 102, No. 15 Bund) and must be registered by the end of August. As August 31st is a Sunday, the committee will still be open as usual. To date, a total of 600 to 700 cases have been registered.</p>
<h3>Cai Lianfa Arrives in Shanghai for Inspection to Promote National Goods Exports to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Cai Lianfa, Chairman of the Manila Chinese National Goods Importers Association, flew to Shanghai recently to inspect and discuss with national goods exporters and major manufacturers in the city to promote the export of national goods to the Philippines. It is reported that Mr. Cai plans to hold a national goods exhibition in the Philippines after returning to promote them. During his stay in Shanghai, his contact address is Pacific Trading Company, No. 17 Jinling East Road.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market weakened as the recent surge in prices was too large, buyers were hesitant, and the market had ample supply. The final price of 10-pack British cigarettes fell by 900,000 yuan compared to the 26th, to 14.6 million yuan. Old Knife cigarettes also fell by 650,000 yuan, to 11.85 million yuan. Other Chinese cigarettes and American boxed cigarettes also declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Group Savings Business Opens in Guangzhou, Hankou, and Chongqing on September 1st</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau's group savings business has achieved excellent results in the past half-month. The bureau has decided to expand the business to major cities such as Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing on September 1st and will also launch a mail savings program. The first phase of savings began on the 15th of this month, and all savings bonds are expected to be sold out by the end of the month.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Dr. Qian Mingxi!</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Having previously read a piece in the "Current Affairs News" evening edition and a circulating message among the eight medical associations in this city, I learned that Dr. Qian Mingxi, a surgeon at Nanjing Municipal Hospital, passed away after administering spinal anesthesia to a patient, Diao Rongtai, who suffered from acute appendicitis before surgery. The court deemed it manslaughter and sentenced him to one year and six months of imprisonment. Alas, this Dr. Qian Mingxi! Heaven and earth are ruthless, treating all things as straw dogs. Living in this chaotic world, everyone is in danger. Is this not just Dr. Qian's concern alone? I write this to mourn him.</p>
<p>We do not wish to inquire whether the Nanjing court's judgment was fair or not. We also do not wish to inquire whether Dr. Qian was negligent in this instance. What we want to ask is whether the acute appendicitis that Diao Rongtai suffered from required surgery! If this kind of acute appendicitis were left untreated surgically, allowing it to change naturally, would it not have led to death? If this kind of acute appendicitis would have inevitably led to death without surgery, then Dr. Qian's actions were indeed justified. As for the type of anesthesia he chose to use before the surgery, that was his absolute personal freedom. Not only is the judge unable to determine whether it was appropriate, but even those like us who have not personally witnessed the situation cannot rashly criticize it. We serve the public, and we encounter all kinds of strange and unpredictable diseases every day. At this moment, we can only rely on our knowledge and experience to take emergency measures, without considering the consequences. If we knew that we might be held liable for imprisonment afterward, then no one would want to risk the law. Such a wise and self-preserving approach may not harm the doctor, but it would be detrimental to the patient. After all, there are countless acute patients in the world who need our emergency care. If doctors are unwilling to risk the law and sit idly by, then countless patients will be left to die. Is this the original intention of the country's laws to protect the lives of the people? Nowadays, incompetent doctors abound, killing people unknowingly in countless instances. The authorities not only fail to take measures to crack down on them but instead indulge them, turning a blind eye. Is this justice?</p>
<p>Alas! The sage is not benevolent, treating the people as straw dogs. Dr. Qian Mingxi is gone. Should we doctors change our profession to those who measure pulses with three fingers and talk medicine on paper?</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on "Polydipsia and Polyuria" in Children</h3>
<p>— Wang Juerong</p>
<p>In the past three years, every summer, pediatric departments of various hospitals and private clinics have seen an increase in a type of childhood epidemic, with four prominent symptoms: First, persistent high fever. Second, thirst. Third, polyuria. Fourth, an increase in lymphocytes in the blood. Patients are mostly young children. Although the prognosis is good, treatment is quite difficult. The findings of our research on this disease over the past three years are recorded below:</p>
<p>Causes: Completely unknown. It mainly occurs in children under the age of five, especially infants and those under two years old.</p>
<p>Transmission is mostly through direct contact with patients. Patients have no immunity, and many suffer from it again, with some even experiencing it for three consecutive years.</p>
<p>It is mostly prevalent during the hot summer months and decreases as the weather cools down in the autumn.</p>
<p>Susceptible individuals: Children with lymphatic constitution, enlarged tonsils, or physical weakness and malnutrition are most susceptible to this disease. It is also easy to contract if a cold is not fully recovered from.</p>
<p>This disease is mostly contracted through direct contact with patients. There have been cases where several children in one family or neighborhood contracted it one after another. It is still questionable whether the pathogen exists in the secretions of the mouth and nose.</p>
<p>The route of entry for the pathogen is generally through the tonsils or the sinus area of the nose.</p>
<p>Symptoms:</p>
<p>Incubation period: The average is (three to seven days). Prodromal period: Initially, there is mild diarrhea. Urine is reduced and yellow in color, and the temperature increases sharply in the last two days (39℃ to 39.5℃). This period lasts about three to five days before transitioning to the next stage.</p>
<p>Increased urination period: The child's temperature fluctuates between 39℃ and 40℃. Thirst suddenly increases, and they are not afraid of even extremely hot water. As a result, a few may experience burns to the mouth and tongue. From this point on, the amount and frequency of urination both increase sharply, occurring three to four times to seven to eight times per hour. The urine is clear, and the quantity is large.</p>
<p>The average daily water intake is 1600cc to 3000cc, and the daily urine output exceeds the water intake by more than 20% (i.e., the daily urine output is 1800cc to 3600cc). Because the urine output exceeds the water intake, the child exhibits mild dehydration after a few days. During this period, aside from persistent high fever and a significant increase in water intake and urination, there are no other symptoms. The child often remains in good spirits and may play as usual.</p>
<p>Blood tests: White blood cells are mostly increased (12000-15000), but they may also be decreased (400-5500). In the white blood cell differential, lymphocytes are significantly increased (40%-55%).</p>
<p>Urine tests: Protein, negative (or trace).</p>
<p>Sugar, absolutely negative.</p>
<p>Urine culture: Also shows no results. The author is currently planning to conduct inoculation experiments using the patient's urine and blood. Without proper treatment, this period may last for more than a month, averaging 49 days, before entering the recovery period.</p>
<p>Recovery period: Starting from the 48th day on average, urination gradually decreases, and water intake also decreases. After a few days, the fever gradually subsides, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>Children may also recover early due to a sudden drop in temperature, but if the weather suddenly turns hot again after the autumn coolness, this disease may reappear. (According to the author's statistics, the temperature of the weather is often directly proportional to the various symptoms of the patients, but there are also cases where this disease occurs in early winter.)</p>
<p>Mild cases: There are also cases where urination increases, and the fever rises for a week to ten days, and then they recover on their own.</p>
<p>Severe cases: Some children suddenly develop a high fever, convulsions, rapid pulse, cyanosis of the lips, and die, or they develop symptoms of encephalopathy due to dehydration caused by improper treatment and die.</p>
<p>Complications: Due to the lack of proper treatment for this disease, nutritional imbalances may occur, and secondary tuberculosis has been seen in several cases after treatment.</p>
<p>Prognosis: Most children who receive proper treatment recover in the autumn coolness, so the prognosis of this disease is generally good.</p>
<p>Treatment: 1. Vitamin B: Injecting Vitamine B and taking Yeast orally can increase appetite, but it has no significant effect on this disease.</p>
<p>2, Vitamin B2: Ineffective.</p>
<p>3. Vit.pp.: Ineffective.</p>
<p>4. Vit.c.: Injecting large amounts of Vit.c can lower the fever, but the urine output does not decrease. When the injection is stopped, the fever returns.</p>
<p>5. Sulfagroup: Can prevent complications but has no significant effect on this disease.</p>
<p>6. Penicillin: The temperature may decrease in the first three days of injection, but the urine output does not decrease. Afterward, the temperature rises again, so Penicillin also has no significant effect.</p>
<p>7. Streptomycin: The author has not tried it, but Dr. Gao Jinglang tried it, and the results also showed that it was ineffective.</p>
<p>8. Cold water bath: Three times a day, each time for one to three minutes, can significantly lower the temperature.</p>
<p>9. Silkworm cocoon tea: Oral administration, brewing seven to ten silkworm cocoons into tea daily to replace beverages, can reduce urination after taking it for seven days, but the temperature does not decrease.</p>
<p>10. Pituitary extract injection: Each injection is 0.3cc, which is three units, injected once every four hours. It can reduce urination after every three injections, but after stopping the injection, it returns to normal in six to ten hours. Multiple injections can cause toxic symptoms.</p>
<p>11. Environmental therapy: The best. The day after the patient arrives in the deep mountains, the fever gradually decreases, and urination gradually returns to normal, making it the most suitable therapy.</p>
<p>12. Air-conditioned ward: The author is researching with Dr. Gao Jinglang. If an "air-conditioned ward" can be set up to keep the indoor air at around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, patients can stay in the hospital and return home when the weather cools down, which will definitely be effective. Unfortunately, due to material conditions, it has not been tested.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The pathogen of this disease is still unknown, and there are four theories about the cause of the disease:</p>
<p>(1) Sunlight relationship: Due to sudden hot weather, young children develop this disease after being exposed to high-heat sunlight.</p>
<p>(2) The adrenal glands react due to heat.</p>
<p>(3) Inflammation of the periphery of the pituitary gland.</p>
<p>(4) There is a pathogen, probably a Virus-filtrant that becomes active when the temperature reaches 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Note 1: Dr. Gao Jinglang and the author are continuing to study the theory of this disease separately. If colleagues or patients in various places have symptoms that differ from this article or have special treatments, please advise. Correspondence address: Transfer to the Shanghai Medical Association.</p>
<p>Note 2: This article is based on the author's medical records for the past three years, but according to Dr. Gao Jinglang, the Lsmghocyter in the patient's white blood cells has increased to more than 70%, and atypical lymphocytes have also been found in the blood. Therefore, Dr. Gao Jinglang calls it a type of "glandular fever." It is recorded together for research and expresses admiration for Dr. Gao Jinglang's spirit of research after his diagnosis.</p>
<p>Jun Qing's note: Dr. Wang's article is very valuable for introduction because there are many people in Shanghai suffering from this disease. If their parents can read this article, it will be beneficial. I have encountered several cases, and their lymphocyte count has also reached 70%. I have repeatedly treated them without success and was at a loss. Later, I changed to using rest and improved nutrition methods before gradually recovering. Dr. Gao Jinglang believes it is glandular fever, and I also have the same feeling, but I don't know if my colleagues agree?</p>
<h3>Japanese Schistosomiasis, Prevalent in Southern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>— Shen Luo</p>
<p>Japanese schistosomiasis (Schistosoma Japonica) is prevalent in various parts of Southern Jiangsu. Along with black fever and yaws in Northern Jiangsu, it is a local endemic disease in Jiangsu Province. Active prevention and treatment of Japanese schistosomiasis (hereinafter referred to as "blood disease") has only begun in recent years. In May of the 35th year of the Republic, the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department, concerned about the increasingly serious spread of the disease, established the Southern Jiangsu Local Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute, specializing in dealing with local endemic diseases such as schistosomiasis and hookworm, as well as other intestinal parasites. The institute is now located in the town of Mudu in Wu County, where schistosomiasis is more prevalent. However, the outside world still lacks a deep understanding of the prevalence and transmission of schistosomiasis. The author, regardless of literary skill, has written this article to inform the public and draw attention to the prevention and treatment of the disease. It would be an honor if it could spark further discussion and receive guidance from more experienced individuals.</p>
<p>A. Japanese schistosomiasis is not transmitted from Japan. Japanese schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease of the internal organs caused by the invasion of the Japanese schistosome into the human body. It was first discovered in 1904 by three Japanese scholars, Katsurada, Tsuchiya, and Fujinami. For ease of reference, the disease was named "Japanese Schistosomiasis" in medicine to distinguish it from Egyptian schistosomiasis (S. Haematobium) in Africa and Manson's schistosomiasis (S. Mansoni) in the Americas and the West Indies.</p>
<p>Japanese schistosomiasis has also been discovered in China. Cases were reported as early as 1905. However, in medical practice, newly discovered disease names, treatments, and drugs are often named after the discoverer's surname or place name. Therefore, Japanese schistosomiasis also follows this convention, adding the earliest discovered place name – Japan – to the scientific name of schistosomiasis. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Chatting After Diagnosis (Continued to the End)</h3>
<p>— Wu Jihua</p>
<p>Optarson is a mixture of organic arsenic and strychnine (a nerve stimulant). Its advantage is only that it has low toxicity and few side effects, but it does not have exceptional restorative power. Recently, I used Glyderophosphate compound Lilly (1,000 yuan per injection) to achieve the same effect. Domestic drugs such as Tonicol are also available, so it is really not worth buying.</p>
<p>Tonophosphan is an organic phosphorus preparation with both strong and weak packaging. It functions to stimulate metabolism, nourish nerves, and promote bone development. However, its effect is slow, and it is not easy to see significant results even after injecting ten or twenty shots. I remember when I was studying, I was very weak in nerves because I studied too hard. I tried thirty or forty shots of concentrated Tonophosphan, but I didn't get significant results. Later, I recovered by resting. A substitute for this drug is Pliosfen from Guangming Pharmaceutical Factory. The ingredients are said to be the same as the German product, and the price is very cheap, only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per box (10 pieces). Although I dare not guarantee that Pliosfen is exactly the same as Tonophosphan, phosphorus preparations are always phosphorus preparations. Perhaps the difference between domestic and European and American drugs can be compared to enamel washbasins. European and American products are more solid, the iron blanks are thicker, and the appearance is smoother, while domestic products are thinner, the iron blanks are inferior, and the appearance is inevitably imperfect. But a washbasin is always a washbasin, and it is not impossible to use it for household use.</p>
<p>The reason why Schering's Spermin is so expensive is probably because it is the only foreign product. Speaking of Spermin, it has really declined and should be eliminated. However, because the level of education in society is too low, medical knowledge can be said to be almost non-existent, so the waste that has long been shelved abroad still has a thriving business in the Chinese market. You can see all kinds of wonderful names and all kinds of novel advertisements on the newspaper. Those who are good at advertising can make a fortune by relying on Spermin, and there are indeed several pharmaceutical factories that started with Spermin and rely on Spermin to stand firm. I remember six or seven years ago, the German manager of Schering Foreign Bank had dinner with me one night. When the wine was very high, he took out a letter from his arms and taught me to read it. This letter was written to him by the scientific department of Schering Pharmaceutical Factory in Berlin. It said: "In our Germany, Spermin has long been unused, because after the rapid progress in the research of testicular hormones, Spermin's position has been replaced by Gaisweixiong. The part of our factory that manufactures organ extracts has long been closed, but there are still many wastes left. If you can promote Spermin in China, we will be very excited to accept the opportunity to use waste. You must know that the testicles are the organs that produce male hormones, but they are immediately input into the blood after being produced. They are not storage warehouses, so the male hormones extracted from the testicles are actually very small, and it is difficult to obtain clinical effects. If the patient feels excited after using it, it is probably a psychological effect." I was very ashamed after reading it, so I had to laugh and say that you Germans used to be fooled by Spermin. From this, we can know that buying Schering's Spermin is no different from paying a high price to buy fake antiques.</p>

<p>Random Notes from Shanghai</p>
<h3>Extortion and Ghosts</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Inspector Cha Yan of the Direct Taxation Bureau extorted tens of millions from the woodworking industry and then threatened them to fabricate statements saying, "There was no bribery." The terribleness of officialdom's abuse of power is such!</p>
<p>If it weren't for the Council's exposure, who knows when the people's grievances from being bullied, oppressed, and extorted by officialdom would be redressed!</p>
<p>It is said that there are 2,800 registered dancers, but in reality, it is said that there are 10,000 unregistered dancers in all the aforementioned bars.</p>
<p>If the dance halls were closed, the future of these 10,000 people would be unimaginable.</p>
<p>It is not easy to study even if you have money. For example, private school tuition is expensive, and to apply for "municipal" or "public" schools, you have to "go through the back door" and ask people to write "eight-line letters" for you.</p>
<p>I didn't expect that there was such a thing to apply for college. "Studying" also has to "plead," is this the "sadness" of "students" or the "tragedy" of the education world?</p>
<p>The ones who violate traffic rules the most on Shanghai roads are—pedicabs! When they are empty, they wander around in the center of the road; when they are carrying passengers, they don't keep to the side or move in single file; often two or three pedicabs travel side by side in the center of the road.</p>
<p>How can Shanghai's traffic not be congested under such circumstances? How can it not be chaotic?</p>
<p>I personally admire Director Yu Shuping's theory on interrogating criminals. It seems that China needs to strengthen its knowledge of criminal psychology and the use of scientific methods to collect evidence.</p>
<p>The case of Kelley and Malley's murder has been dragging on until now as an example.</p>
<p>These two days, not only are there "ghosts" haunting the Huangpu River in Shanghai, but there is also some kind of "eye-gouging gang" appearing. Actually, there is nothing. The city is making even a normal, healthy person turn into a "neurotic."</p>

<h3>Americans Look at the British Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhengming</p>
<p>Since the end of the Great War, the United States has been facing another British economic crisis for the second time. A few people in Washington are discussing these facts:</p>
<p>Until the outbreak of World War II, Britain had always been the largest exporting country in the world, but due to unfavorable trade balances for nine consecutive years, foreign exchange reserves have been gradually depleted, especially US dollars.</p>
<p>The industrial recovery in Britain and the repair of factories destroyed in the war have fallen far behind schedule; if there is another winter like last year, it will be difficult to support.</p>
<p>The $3.75 billion loan borrowed from the United States will be used up by the end of this year; Downing Street's US dollars are being used very rapidly. In July alone, $700 million was used.</p>
<p>When Prime Minister Attlee stood up in the House of Commons and announced an unprecedented new austerity program in peacetime, Washington still didn't ask. What Washington is concerned about is the effectiveness of Attlee's plan, is it just a prelude to asking for another loan?</p>
<p>Preparations are now underway to ease the conditions of this existing loan because Britain has once again requested to reopen negotiations on the terms, so the United States will also investigate Britain's use of this US dollar loan.</p>
<p>The situation in Britain is extremely critical, although not as bad as in many other European countries. Washington's view is that Britain, seeing that their credit range in the United States and Canada is shrinking, and that their export target announced in February is at least 20% short, launched this crisis to obtain further US assistance, possibly to borrow an additional loan.</p>
<p>Britain, aware that the current bad situation may reach its worst peak this winter, has now decided to show their cards on the table for various excellent political reasons. The UK’s problem is clearer than it was a few months ago when the issue of aid to the whole of Europe under the Marshall Plan was occupying the center stage of the world stage.</p>
<p>There is evidence that Britain has enough resources to support itself, pending the effective implementation of the Marshall Plan. In a sense, the British had foreseen that they would have a crisis, prepared for a rainy day, and made preparations in advance. (Translated from Newsweek)</p>
<h3>The Absurd Eye-Gouging Gang</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuande</p>
<p>Recently, a terrible message has been spreading through the streets and alleys: It is said that women, the elderly, and children are hiding sharp weapons and using inquiries or requests for a seat as an excuse to gouge out people's eyes. They also vividly describe the stories, "The grandmother of someone at some place was gouged out of her eyes because someone asked to rest for a while and was invited into the house. The person also escaped. Also, the child of someone at some place had his heart and lungs gouged out. Someone at some place was about to gouge out eyes but was seen by others, who beat the person up and sent them to the × bureau, who knew that the × bureau opened the back door and let the eye-gouging person run away. Someone else caught a person at some place, and confiscated sharp tools for gouging out eyes, such as bamboo tubes, curved knives, and... and even a certificate from the ×× bureau calling him to gouge out eyes. There was also a person caught at some place, and an eye-gouging certificate was found..." The more absurd it is, the more terrifying it is. In the hearts of the ignorant people, a dead knot was formed. The propagandists repeatedly added fuel to the fire, saying that it was more certain than what they had seen with their own eyes....</p>
<p>So... in Yangsi Township, Gaochang Temple, and even Dapu Bridge, news of mistaken beatings occurred one after another (one dead and one injured). The dead and injured were people with families and regular jobs. In Caojiadu, another mistaken beating occurred, again with two dead and injured. After the murderers were arrested and interrogated, it turned out like this:</p>
<p>"I only heard people talk about the appearance of the eye-gouging gang, and I haven't seen it myself; at that time, I heard people shout and beat, and I participated in the beating in a moment of impulse, thus causing a murder..."</p>
<p>The ignorant people actually regarded the ×× bureau and the ××× government as slaughterhouses specializing in collecting "human hearts" and "human eyes". At the same time, some people also said that the eyes were collected in preparation for making "air-conditioned atomic bombs" to fight the communists...</p>
<p>It's another funny story that broke my guts.</p>
<p>"In fact, these things are completely unwarranted, and I don't know where the rumors came from..."</p>
<p>Shanghai is really absurd sometimes.</p>
<h3>A Momentary Thrill</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>The French word Sensation, directly translated, means "feeling." But I think it is more appropriate to translate it as "a momentary thrill." Because we are living in this world, everyone is living for "a momentary thrill." For example, a penniless person, his only hope is to have money. People with money are even more eager to have money. He works hard, or steals, or, in the most fashionable term, "embezzles," his purpose is to have money. When the penniless person really gets money, when he really has money, he only feels a little pleasure at that moment of getting the money, and after that moment, it becomes ordinary. Therefore, some people want to have 200,000 when they have 100,000, and they want to have 1 million when they have 200,000, and they want to have 10 million when they have 1 million, and they want to go on forever without end. Why? To feel a momentary thrill for that number. In my opinion, there is really no difference between eating cornbread with pickles and eating shark fin with bear's paw. Shark fin with bear's paw is nothing more than giving the mouth a momentary thrill. After eating it, the feces it becomes is not better than eating cornbread and pickles. But people are always looking for excitement, a momentary thrill. I remember one year (1935) when the World Exposition was held in Brussels, there was a game called high-altitude railway. I saw many people getting off the car with sad faces. Out of curiosity, I bought a ticket and followed other people onto the car. After the car started, it was slow at first and then fast, and the highest speed was used both up and down. The heart of everyone sitting in the car was almost jumping out of the chest. Some people were so scared that they kept shouting. After getting off the car, I asked a companion, what's the point of this? He said: Sensation, (for a momentary thrill) He said it too right, because nothing in the world is not like this. (August 12, 36 in Qingdao)</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>American Detective News</p>
<p>Detective novels and magazines can be said to be America's unique publications. No other country has such rich material and dramatic descriptions. Americans' curiosity and fondness for novelty have created many talented detective writers. A large proportion of these novelists are police officers, so their writing is so intimate and flavorful, with both text and illustrations. According to my reading, there are more than twenty kinds of famous American detective magazines. "True Detective Stories" and "Police Gazette" can be bought at any newsstand. The detective novels written by Americans are based on facts, not fabricated out of thin air, and they include actual photos. Such material is readily available in local newspapers. It only needs to be organized and supplemented to become a good article. American newspapers attach great importance to local news. Because, except for a few newspapers like the New York Times, which have a global reach, the rest are local newspapers. And local newspapers also have a detailed obligation to report local news. If a murder occurs in the local area, this is a major event. Regarding the safety of all citizens, everyone feels a personal impact. How can the local newspaper not record the news of the assassination because of its suggestive, lewd, or thieving content? Even officials, in order to show their own virtuous governance and prevent their superiors from knowing, forbid local newspapers from publishing it. How foolish is that! Shanghai is a place where social news is produced, but the first-class material occupies the last-class position in the newspapers. This is a great pity. For example, the Shen Junru case is first-class news material, but after searching all the newspapers in Shanghai, none of them have a systematic record. Regarding her photos, her past decades of scandalous history, her daily life, and the course of her physiological perversion, the newspaper should send a specialist to inquire about her past landlords, investigate old files of crimes in the police station, interview doctors who were close to her, interview all her relatives and friends, and cooperate with police officers to examine all her private belongings and correspondence to obtain valuable information. What is the style of American newspapers? They often send news reporters with cameras to wait for information at street corners and alleys. To give a concrete example, when a reporter strolled past a large hotel, a guest suddenly jumped from the forty-second floor to commit suicide. Before the suicide victim landed, the reporter raised his camera and took a picture. Then, he rushed back to deliver the negative to the newspaper's photography department for developing and plate-making. He then rushed back to the hotel and police station to find out the identity of the guest, the cause of the suicide, his usual life, his friends, the autopsy, and the police handling. A detailed long article was already in the evening paper that day. That kind of valuable photo—a suicide victim falling in mid-air—was distributed to newspapers all over the world within twenty-four hours by airmail and telecommunication, increasing sales by no less than tens of millions of copies, which together is still extremely cheap. Newspapers are fundamentally about reporting news, of course, with novelty as the main thing. People who do not like novelty will never read newspapers and will instead read the "Imperial Qing Classics Explained." Detective news is the representative of novelty material. The recent murder-for-money cases in Shanghai have neither photos nor detailed records. The shooting of war criminals, one wolf and one tiger, caused a stir in the newspapers for a while, but it was only superficial records. There were no reports about the war criminals' backgrounds and families, their criminal records, or the living conditions of the victims' relatives. It can only be regarded as watching a drama without plot or system. What a pity! (46)</p>
