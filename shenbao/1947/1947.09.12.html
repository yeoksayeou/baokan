<h3>張治中在全會報告　新疆問題三階段　今後須於建設中求安定</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十一日電〕昨日抵京之張治中將軍，於十一日上午中央黨團聯席會議中報吿新疆問題，張氏就新疆之過去及現在情形，作扼要之叙述後、並對將來情形作一預測。據張氏報吿稱：說到新疆之過去，當然不能講得太遠，遠的要在左宗棠到新疆，或者由新疆建省時說起，但本人今日所要說的新疆過去情形，是由卅三年新疆省政府改組，直至今年五月麥斯武德爲新疆省政府主席時止，在此一時期中，可分三個階段加以說明：第一階段爲軍事時期，卅三年十一月七日伊寗事變開始，大家知道在盛世才離新時，中央軍正在抗戰，但爲解救新疆人民，收復國家版圖，中央曾抽調少數部隊赴新，但到了吳忠信主席就任未及一月，伊寗發生暴動，中央軍在新力量薄弱，又因氣候補給及種種關係，不得不撤退，伊寗遂吿失守。至卅四年九月，伊寗再度發生叛亂，伊寗·塔城·阿山三區全部失陷，在此時期，因當抗戰勝利結束之初，中央為爭取國內和平，遂派本人赴新，蔣主席並指示本人當以挽救危機，安定新疆，以中央和平政策處理新疆問題，本人至新後即與伊寗方面商談，經八閱月始獲協議，此可為和平商談階段，迄去年七月一日，新疆省府根據和平條款予以改組，伊寗方面參加省府者有六委員，實際上只四委員就任，直至今年五月廿八日，麥斯武德奉命爲省主席止，新疆情形是由軍事行動，和平商談而進入政治鬥爭之階段，本人一年來曾發覺伊寗方面企圖以伊寗·塔城·阿山三區為根據地，向其餘七區發展使其特殊化，然後再利用特殊手段來控制新疆政權。五月間本人至南疆視察，即發現此一事態之嚴重，不得不建議中央設法抑制此一傾向之發展，並建議本人退出新省主席地位，而以麥斯武德就任主席，以上乃過去大槪情形。新疆現在情形，應從麥斯武德任主席，直至伊寗省府委員全部撤退爲止，在此三個月中，照常識判斷，中央以麥氏爲主席，伊寗方面實無理由反對，蓋麥氏維吾爾（即突厥）族在新疆全人口中佔百分之九十，是新疆少數民中之多數民族，麥氏就任主席，當可證明中央尊重少數民族之意，但不幸麥氏任命令發表後，伊寗人士譁然，羣起反對，並仍要求本人繼續主持省政，此誠屬矛盾之現象。然在伊寗人士看來，並不矛盾，蓋彼等有彼等之認識心理及企圖，現事態業已僵化，中央命令決不容有改變，而伊寗方面亦表示決絕，因此，新省參議會開幕後，即未成會，本人曾加調解，仍然無效，現伊寗方面省府委員及各機關伊寗工作人員均已相率撤退，此可認爲彼等最後表明之態度，本人為此，曾於九月一日函詢伊方人士三點：即（一）是否擬片面撕毀和平條款，（二）是否擬再度武裝變亂，願負破壞和平之責任，（三）如無以上二意，是否願再來和平商談，惟此函迄本人八日離迪時，得悉尙未到達伊方，目前正等候答覆中　。至將來新疆情形究將發展至何境地，雖不敢作肯定判斷，但本一人可向大會報吿者，即新疆情形以今日情况觀察，當不至如何惡化，似不會再有武裝叛亂之事，自然吾人亦不能過份樂觀與大意，更有進者，今後新疆問題當不在伊寗之態度如何，而一切應求其在我，一般對新疆問題看法，不外（一）新疆問題爲一外交問題，（二）新疆問題爲一民族問題，（三）新疆問題爲外交。民族兩問題交織而成之問題，但今後要解決此一問題，應該民族。外交雙管齊下，尤其在中央立塲，應首先注重民族問題。今日之新疆已爲三民主義光輝照耀下之新疆，吾人身爲黨員者，應在該地忠實執行三民主義政策，新疆四百萬人口中，有三百餘萬是認識中央，擁護中央，其餘在伊寗三區中約七十萬人，亦有大多數迫於淫威，敢怒而不敢言，幾年來，民族主義政策已在新疆推行，現在最重要之事，莫過於積極推行民生主義政策，因爲新疆人民最窮苦，文化敎育一切落後，然蘊藏於土下者，却最爲豐富。張氏最後特別强調稱：今日新疆危機已過，新疆永遠是中華民國的新疆，問題即今後如何建設新疆，因爲建設新疆即所以安定新疆，亦即爭取人民內向之唯一良策。</p>
<h3>黨員誓詞　中國國民黨黨員誓詞</h3>
<p>「余敬宣誓，信仰總理孫先生之遺敎，願加入本黨，爲實現三民主義，五權憲法之新中國而努力，並服從決議，遵守紀律，實行政綱。政策，接受總裁領導，同甘苦·共患難，一心一德，貫澈始終，如違誓言，願受本黨最嚴厲之制截，謹誓」。</p>
<h3>主席嚴詞痛責　依賴外援心理</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十一日電〕蔣主席昨夜在黨團聯席會議發表演說，分析當前之情形後稱：吾人之經濟，政治，軍事情形，幷無危險，倘國民黨黨負能嚴格遵行政府之命令，則經濟情形自能穩定與改善、社會人士同情國民黨，人民亦擁護國民政府，共黨在中國今已註定其命運。戰爭結束時，余本擬發行新幣，當時有九億元美匯可作爲基金，但乃因財政與經濟專家認爲不獲外援，無能爲力，而予以擱置，此種依賴外人心理，殆將沒有成功，倘當時能接受此計劃，則今日之情形，自將完全不同。今在經濟，軍事方面，倘能即獲外援，則當能早日成功，但不獲外援，政府亦能渡過此難關，惟時日較長耳。</p>

<h3>海南島低訴</h3>
<p>— 卜少夫</p>
<p>南遊雜草之五　（上）</p>
<p>C47型機從白雲機塲騰空後，我的腦子便在構想着兩小時後便到達的這座南中國海中的孤島，它在亞熱帶圈內，它是怎樣一副面目呢？</p>
<p>這次南行以來，在我們這個小團體中，海南島是唯一爲全體所未到過的一個陌生的地方，除去S君在戰時曾隨美國戰鬥機來轟炸過秀英港，除去我在珍珠港事件前從香港乘海輪去海防，在海口港外停椗三小時，受過敵人的檢査外，我們過去的知識誰都對海南島是一張素紙。</p>
<p>我在構想着，同行者也都這樣構想着：</p>
<p>棕櫚樹，椰子林，到處聳立，在月光下，男人彈着吉他，女人　着熱帶味的情歌，一羣圍坐的男女老幼作節拍的鼓掌，………</p>
<p>西江的水災區泛濫着，這片　慘景象，在機翼下豁露，令我們這批火奴魯魯狂想客爽然若失。</p>
<p>火奴魯魯印象，直到四天後我們離開海南島，誰也沒有找到。雖然我們祇是盤桓於海口，甚至最近的文昌都未涉足，但所有接觸到的嘉積，樂會，萬寗，甚至儋縣的朋友，都笑着吿訴我們這個美麗的懸想，恐怕是好萊塢電影畫面的感染。這時我們不能不承認了。</p>
<p>珠島，珠崖，瓊州，瓊崖，這都是海南島的名稱，這塊面積近十萬方華里的島嶼，其地理形勢頗像香港，香港隔海與九龍半島相望，海南島却像雷州半島口裏的一粒珍珠，不過海南島幾乎比香港大一千倍，而與雷州半島之間最狹的海面距離，也畏過港九四倍，這是個很有趣的地理上再版，差別在大型與小型而已。</p>
<p>事實上，海口的市區風景，那種情調，有些像廣州灣，也有些像海防。而所呈現着的，是雜亂，奄奄無生氣，人們的一切活動，無目的似的。這種感覺，兩個月前我在北平，在瀋陽，有過，這次在漢口，在長沙，也同樣爲這種氣氛所困惑。這是一種普遍的內在斵傷，基本的衰萎，且爲抗戰期間各城市所未經見的。　空氣很寗靜，却不能掩飾人們內心的不安，一個改制的問題拖延幾近一年，從專署以下，各級行政不可能不受其影響。在八月九日我們到海口後四小時，瓊崖（九區）專員蔡勁軍在椰子園舉行的座談會中，我曾以這個問題相詢，他很乾脆地回答：『在職一天，幹一天』。從這句話裏我不敢保設他再有更長期的計劃，我也更不敢保證他的屬下每個人都能安之若素。</p>
<p>椰子園（地名）從前是日本海南島派遣軍司令部，房舍于盡是日本式，蔡的辦公室內還有草席　，不過園內景色，一片熱帶風光，海口中除這裏可以看到成叢茂的椰林外，那得到文昌才可以領略到這些林菁的情趣了。椰子園現在已決定撥充海南大學校址，這一片廣袤海灘新塡地上，將來對於紋歌不輟的學子倒是一塊怡養身心的好處所。</p>

<p>〔中央社紐約十日電〕據遠東問題專家楊氏稱：蘇聯可能欲瞻養「滿洲」僞帝溥儀，而於東北成立共產黨省份。楊氏本日係爲赫斯德系報紙撰述專論，內稱：蘇聯拒絕將溥儀引渡至中國政府，或係準備將　儀送同東北，出任「無產階級政府首領，成爲傾向蘇聯之緩衝國，而與一九三一至一九三五年間日本利用溥儀時完全相同」。楊氏稱：「共產主義國家設一君主，似屬背於常情，但此就　儀一生奇異之命運而言，尙無不合」。文中追求蘇聯於一九三五年與　儀片面成立「公約」，以四千萬元出賣東北中蘇共有之中東鐵路然，蘇聯未予中國一分一厘，自偏向一邊之雅爾達　定後，蘇聯現又獲得東北鐵路之共同控制權，而一九三五年蘇聯出賣鐵路所獲之四千萬元，今固一字不提矣。楊氏支持我國之要求，聲稱：溥儀應交還中國，以漢奸罪受審，因溥儀爲中國之遜君，故爲中國之公民，彼與日本聯合反叛本國，故應以漢奸及戰犯罪受審。</p>
<h3>召開對日和會聲中　美重視我國立塲　馬歇爾稱將與各國談判</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕關於所傳中國行政院長張　在演說中所稱，蘇聯不出席之對日和會，中亂當不參加一節，此間官方人士聞之，今夜咸表駭異。據消息靈通人士稱，美國尙未接獲中國方面此說之正式通知，但美國政府官員承認，倘中國果採取此一立塲，則美國對於早日召開對日和會一事，殆將因此益見複雜。此間中國人士談稱，張羣之言或有誤傳這可能，就大使館所知而論，中國今之立塲仍與上月答覆美國之建議時相同。當時中國與美國意見所不能一致者乃美國擬在和曾中廢止否決權而代以四强中三票之多數，以定決議一項主張。此乃修改否決權，將使任何一强無法作異議，故中國當時即通知美國，倘別國有其他意見，當願再行考慮所持之立塲。聞十一國遠委員會，有若干委員認爲中國殆將採取此一立塲。</p>
<p>據接近遠東委會中國代表之人士稱，中國近在遠東委會會議時，意見較冬轉向蘇聯之立塲，皆疑懼美國將重建過於龐大之日本，倘中國果持此立塲，蘇聯不出席，中國亦不參加，則勢需美國重行處理對日和會一項問題。</p>
<p>據可靠消息，美國官員現正擬向遠東委員會十一國發出請柬，邀請彼等至美國，在聯合國大會期內，同時召開對日初步會議，並承認蘇聯有拒不參加之可能，蓋蘇聯已兩次照會美國，說明草擬對日和約應由外長會議辦理，不應由十一國辦理故也。但美國得英國聯邦集團菲列賓及其他國家之擁護，傳將先行爲之，但官方人士亦承認今中國倘與蘇聯同進退，則情形將完全改觀。美國　冒蘇聯不參加但仍進行會議之險，倘不獲中蘇二國參加，則不能爲之。此在某方人士則相信，即使中國採取此立塲，美英勢力仍有使其採取原來方針之可能云。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十日電〕馬歇爾今日在新聞記者招待會中宣稱，關於對日和約，美方現正與有關之十個國家進行談判，但對日和約初步會議，是否可在聯合國大會舉行時召集，則未敢斷言。</p>

<h3>我國對日和會的基本態度</h3>
<p>據合衆社十日華府電，美國官方對於我國張行政院長所稱：「蘇聯不參加之對日和會，中國當不出席」一節，均表示詫異，惟截至目前爲止，我們在報端，並未看到張院長發表談話或演說的全文，一定是美國報界的誤傅。但這幾句話，有關我國對日和會的基本態度，當不可容許美國發生誤會，所以我們有加以說明的必要。</p>
<p>美國誤會我國對日基本態度，或者是因爲王外長最折在滬發表談話所引起。王外長對於美國主張召開對日和約初步會議的一項建議，曾率直表示：『中國業已明白聲明，如蘇聯政府拒絕參加美國所提議之對日和約初步會議，則中國將對此事，重予考慮其立塲』。又謂：『我們不可輕作放棄某些國家之合作，而單獨與日媾和之擬議，吾人努力之目的，應該是訂立有利於全體盟國而且爲全體盟國所共同支持之和約』。這一段話，極其止大而準確，具有積極的意味，爭取蘇聯的參加對日和會，曾獲得中外報界的一致好評。詎意美國竟發生誤會，因中國欲爭取蘇聯參加對日和會，而誤認爲中國的立塲，將與蘇聯同進退。美國官方發生這種誤會，不僅是中美邦交上的不幸，而且也是整個遠東的不幸。</p>
<p>中國對日基本態度，業經官方一再聲明，就是最近張院長在國民黨四中全會中報告內政外交方針時，對於日本和約問題，也指出中國的對日基本態度：質言之，雖不採取報復主義，但決不放棄對日要求應得的賠償，我們願見日本和平復興，但必須防制日本，重爲遠東和平的威脅。這幾句話，把中國的基本態度說得最透澈也沒有了。不僅爲我國朝野所一致擁戴，就是在所有的盟國，也一定會表示歡迎。不過時至今日，對日和約問題，已不在原則和理想的異同，而在盟國之間利害的不一致了。尤其在美蘇兩國之間，因爲利害的不同，不能互忍互信，以致各趨極端，造成目前進退兩難的僵局。美國雖在外交上，千方百計，企圖打開對日和約的僵局，但是始終未能奏效，因此乃有摒棄蘇聯單獨與日本媾和的意向。</p>
<p>單獨與日本媾和的建議，是美國前總統胡佛首先提出的。當時國務院曾聲明，這是胡佛個人的主張，並不是美國政府的見解。但是美國與論界，却感到極大的興趣，對此十分重視，紛紛加以評論。大家都認爲日本投降迄今，將近兩年，而遠東局勢迄未安定，應即締結對日和約，俾早日將遠東政局納入正職，所以一致要求蘇聯重行考竄其態度，所謂單獨與日本媾和之說，在當時不過是一種威脅蘇聯之詞而已，並沒有料到胡佛的主張，竟有實現的可能。但是現在因爲美蘇關係的變化以及遠東局勢的急轉直下，美國竟在考慮將蘇聯摒棄在外，單獨與日本媾和了。</p>
<p>戰後如何收拾遠東殘局？對於我國的安全，關係最爲密切，日本賠償問題的解決，對於我國的利害，尤爲重大；所以從日本投降之日起，中國就希望早日締結對日和約，俾能從速安定遠東的局勢，但格於國際局勢，一市延宕到今日，對日和約尚未起草一個字，早已使中國迫不及待，所以從這一個角度去觀察，中美兩國盼望對日和約早日締結成功的心情，是完全相同的。但是中美兩國的願望，始終未能實現，其癓結何在？很明顯的在於美蘇两國的相持不下，使遠東委員會的工作，幾乎等於陷於停頓狀態，無法推動。這種僵局的相持，首蒙不利影實的，就是我們中國；一方面處於美蘇兩大之間，常常感到左右爲難的痛苦，我國雖曾竭智盡能，願為美蘇間的橋樑，但事實證明均未能如願以償。此在另一方面，我們對於蘇聯的延宕政策，阻撓對日和會的召開，旣因切身利害關係，一再表示不滿；同時對於美國的遠東政策，又不能完全贊同。</p>
<p>第一，美國現行遠東政策，仍未脫「歐洲第一，遠東其次」的作風，美國對於歐洲，在杜魯門主義的大　之下，不惜鉅款，援助希土等國，阻止外來勢力的侵入；但對於遠東，迄未將其杜魯門生義行之於遠東；而遠東危機日深，足以構成國際的亂源，美國外交當局，竞仍熟視無睹，聽任其自然發展。這種政策當足以鑄成美國外交上的大錯。</p>
<p>第二，麥帥對待日本，一味姑息，甚至跡近放縱；日本戰敗國復興的迅速，在近代史上，幾無倫比，就是今日的德國，也望塵莫及。日人在表面上雖蓋其恭順的能事，但黄他們再事侵略的野心，不僅從未放棄，而且早已死灰復燃了。麥帥太信任了日本，其結果，足以造成遠東的再度浩刧。對於中國的和平與安全，不啻是一大威脅；日本對外貿易的提早開放，在經濟上，更使我國惴惴不安。</p>
<p>第三，美國國內有一部分人士，竞主張扶持日本，想把日本當作將來遠東的安定力。這種見解，與戰時美國將中國視爲遠東安定力者，不啻背道而馳。在目下雖然僅是美國民間的意見，但是美國是一個民主國家，一切內政外交，向以民意爲依歸，這種主張，將來也有被政府採納的可能。何况這種見解，還含有別種作用在內。我們假定美國將來忘了珍珠港血的教訓認敵爲友，一旦與日本携手合作，則遠東的大悲劇，就要立即演出了。</p>
<p>由上所述，中國對於美國的遠東政策，不免發生疑懼，因此對於未來的對日和會，不得不力求愼重、我國對日基本態度，雖然始終不變，但是對於和會的方式，不得不爭取蘇聯的參加，誠如外次葉公超所說：『和平爲不可分割，吾人希望看到集體安全，本人特此警告任何國家，不能希望或主張單獨與日本締結和約。』同時對於和會所當採取的表決方法，我國爲保持在和會中的地位起見，我國與論界一致主張保特否決權，因爲此權對於中國，關係實在太大了。中國旣不能像美國居於領導地位，又不能像英國擁有許多衛星國，也不能像蘇聯是那樣强大的國家，遇到重大利害問題時，中國若不能行使否決櫂，就不免被犧牲。</p>
<p>要之，我國對於日本問題，早已決定其所當採取的基本態度，並不斤斤較量自己的利害得失，而注眼於整個遠東的和平與安定。我們雖然渴望對日和會早日召開，但也不願立即締結無利於遠東和平的和約；我們爭取蘇聯的參加和會，並非與蘇聯共進退之謂，而是希望對日和會能顧全全體盟國的利益，使遠東和平建立在合理的基礎上，如此而已。所以我們希望美國刺野能够深切反省，無論爲遠東和平計，或爲美國本身利益計，現行對日政策，實有改弦易轍的必要，無論如何，此際實不容許美國再在外交上鏡成大錯的。</p>

<p>吾人所要求者，爲在法國聯盟內完全獨立，此一獨立應與英國所給予印度及巴基斯坦以及芙國給予菲律貧者相等。今失去權力淪爲乞丐之法國人猶圖行使最下等方式之十九世紀的帝國主義，吾人決不接受。獨立須爲完全獨立，否則吾人決不換受。法國人，爾等應注意亞洲其他部份之和平談判，業已獲得完善之結果，今爾等欲以武力强迫我接受和平，試觀印度尼西亞，荷蘭對該處之發展且已感覺愉快，今爾等之高級專員所建議者，正僞抄襲荷人之故技，其後果必同樣惡劣。吾人不逹目的決不停戰，爾等倘繼續保持今日之立塲，吾人將與怯國聯盟斷絕一切聯繋，果爾則在許多年以內，法國在越南之商業利益將爲之斷絕。吾人決不停戰，越盟解放軍將在戰塲城市各處繼續作戰，直待最後一個法國侵路者被逐出越南海岸爲止。胡氏最後呼籲越盟育年影響其赴戰之號召，並曰「我民族之榮譽已沾汚點，所應由爾等恢復其淸白，快握起利刃，奮戰！努力奮戰！」</p>
<p>〔中央社香港十一日電〕來港參加安南遜下保大召開會議之越南各代表，對法駐越高級專員波拉爾十日廣播詞，表示不滿，認爲法當局不應忽視越獨立與統一之重要性。各該越代表十一日晨在旅邸舉行座談會，但保大未參加。按越南法軍控制區內之越人，係希望法國能與保大締和，恢復君主制。</p>
<h3>美蘇對韓商談無法進行　美考慮單獨行動　南韓美軍總督勒琪病逝</h3>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕馬歇爾國務卿頃證實蘇聯已拒絕美國所提召開四强朝鮮會議之建議，並謂：國務院在採取下一步驟之前，現仍在研究蘇聯之答覆，美國之下一步驟或將與其他有關國家，即中英等國，討論朝鮮問題。馬歇爾繼證實美蘇混合委員會美代表團已有報告抵此，謂無法與蘇聯商獲關於混合委員會工作方針之協議云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦十一日電〕英外相貝文之建議，謂美國應重行採用租借法案，挽救英國之經濟崩潰，使英國政界人士頗爲惶惑。據英外交部之消息靈通人士稱，此爲貝文又一次之失言事件，正如上星期在南港所發表談話，謂美國藏於諾克斯砲台之黄金應激加分配然。</p>

<p>據稱，政府深信下列數端：（一）雜大利農塲工人罷工，係由共產黨在慕後操縱，以圖加深危機；（二）如美國認爲有利時，則對于施用武力，並無遲疑；（三）義副總理共黨領袖陶格利亞特向南尼保證謂，在義大利獲得勝利者，必係莫斯科而非華感頓；（四）社會黨另一首領倫巴陀原經認爲南尼政黨中之緩和力量，今將與南厄分裂，而自行領導不贊成共產主義之社會黨分子。</p>

<p>〔新亞社東京十一日電〕日片山內閣頗以「媾和內閣」自負，意即可負責訂立有利於日本之對日和約。片山組閣當初，即已一意逢迎美國之意旨，冀圖美國於對日和會中，作袒日之提議，然自美國提出召集對日和約預備會議後，蘇聯首倡與議，英聯邦康白拉會議之意見，亦未與美國完全一致，中國政府及民間於對日和約問題，表示時別注意，且擺脫一向作風，對美國之建議並未全部接受。日政府及民間對如此微妙之國際關係，頗感焦急，若干國體及私人現正研究「如何打開此種對日關係之慨局」問題，擬以非正式之外交方式，從事側面活動。片山內閣之首任勞動大臣米窪亮吉，昨日以其個人與英外長貝文於一九三一年在日內瓦參加國際勞工協會，曾一度會面之私交關係，致函貝文，希望以友情援助日本之和平建設。米窰此舉，寬係日本戰敗後之第一次逾越聯合國管制日本之外交活動。其反響及發展，頗値國際人士之注意。</p>

<h3>八局一處代表冒雨下鄉　勘察七寶大塲界址　劃界後貼補數額尙待請示中央　莘莊諸翟請願劃歸市轄</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市與江蘇省劃界問題，懸而未決者垂二十年。其間糾紛迭起，去年十一月間，內政部特派視察程景來滬，會同江蘇省政府及市府代表會同查勘。本年三月，內政部復召集有關各方代表在京舉行會議商討。直至最近，市府始接奉行政院核完本市與江蘇省劃分轄區之各項規定。（詳見六日本報）</p>
<p>市府接奉該項命令後，除咨請蘇省府轉飭有關各縣府定期交代並派員洽商交接手續外，昨日復由地政，警察，教育，社會，衛生，財政，工務，公用八局及民政處代表，冒雨前往七寶及大塲兩區，察勘界址，並調查機關，學校，團體分佈情形。記者隨同前往，自晨十時出發，至傍晚六時半始岗。各局代表分別整理所搜得之資料，以作正式接收後改善施政及建設之參考。</p>
<h3>七寶鎭全貌</h3>
<p>七寶位處松江，清浦，上海之間，其地東西三里，南北十里，共有住戶四一八八戶，居民一七，六四六名。街道狹窄，寬不及丈。區內共有七實，明强兩市立小學，及天主教會所辦之私立肇建小學一所。最近市教育局在該地創設市立農業職業學校，正在修建校舍。頗著聲譽之私立南洋模範中學亦已在七寶覓購基地，待校舍建就後即遷往該處。全區衛生醫療設備甚爲欠缺，蒼蠅　集。社團組織甚少，僅有一慈善機關，曰三善堂。該堂堂擁地二百六十餘畝，最近爲創設市立農，業職業學校，特捐地百畝。警衛由當地民衆自行負責，現有自衛隊員及義務發察一百二十餘名，此外並與在附近駐防之一五二旅等保持聯繫。</p>
<p>莘莊人請願</p>
<p>勘察人員於秋雨泥濘中到達時，街上已滿貼莘莊民衆之紅緣標語，反對莘莊劃入上海縣一行赴南廟休息，莘莊鄉民二百餘人，手執紙旗，高呼口號，要求尊重民意，將莘莊劃入上海市。龍華區長李郁盛，介紹莘莊區民代表五人，面謁地政局專門委員吳遵義，呈文申述莘莊共有居民六，八六一名，其兵役，教育，保甲及稅物等項設施，目前已由市府管理，小學共有張義，莘莊，春申，西農村，板橋，中心校六所，共學生一千八百餘人，其教育經費亦早由市府撥付。呈文最後並對莘莊劃入上海縣，陳訴弊竇。吳專門委員當向全體請願鄉民致詞，表示對此甚爲同情，所提要求，當代轉達政府，待中央核示決定。區民代表繼對行政院所核定之劃界規定中提出疑問數點，吳專門委員亦允轉請中央解釋。</p>
<p>貼補成問題</p>
<p>午後續往大塲，該區南北十六里，東西十二里，人口四萬左右。區內有機塲，兵營，爲軍事地帶。全區共有私立小學五，市立小學十六，興慈中學一所，及民教館大塲分館。目前除地籍外，財政，教育等已由市府管轄，衛生事務所尚未成立，醫療設備欠缺。去年寶山縣府曾欲大塲區民繳納田賦，惟爲該區區民拒絕。目前大塲北部係以蘊藻浜與寶山縣分界，此次行政院之規定係恢復戰前界綫，將分界綫擴展至蘊藻浜北數里之黃泥塘，故大塲區需池備越蕰藻浜接收此數里之土地。大塲西北角，依此次行政院之規定，需有一小塊土地劃入實山縣，兩相比較，劃入之土地較劃出者爲大。所成問題者爲劃界後，如何貼補賓山縣府，將來可能引起糾紛。戰前所定貼補數額，據傳已在一萬六千元左右，至今依何種倍數計算貼補，尚待請示中央商洽決定。</p>
<h3>天壤之別</h3>
<p>記者昨隨同市府勘察人員來往於南北相距甚遠之七寶，大塲之間，穿經熙壤往來高樓大廈之南京路，與七實之街道寬不及丈，泥濘難行之小鎭相比，同爲上海市所轄之區，但其居民之生活方式與享受，相差何啻天壤？記者曾詢莘莊居民，何以堅決反對併入上海縣？答曰：「無他，劃入上海市後，容易發展耳」！</p>
<h3>請翟建協兩代表　請內部派員複勘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市諸翟鎮地方建議協進會，昨派代表行總上海分署儲運局專員黃布衣，上海市第二十五區諸翟國民學校校長張之琦，向市參議會請願，據稱；關於滬西方面之界綫，不能以婚龍江爲界，，而應照蘇州河高崧塘河爲天然界綫，仍將諸翟鎭四北平　併入滬市區域，俾資完　。同時　內政部　行派員蒞勘確定。</p>

<h3>戲劇業嘆苦　請寬放營業時間</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市戲劇院業公會理事長周劍星以政府厲行節約，將規定縮短營業時間，特函請市參議會轉請中央予以寬放，並列舉理由數點略稱：（一）營業時間縮短後，大批演員職工，勢將裁减，將引起失業問題。（二）戲劇同業對於國家社會之公益，無論慰勞勸募，向來出力極多，而負担捐稅，爲數亦鉅，故望不列在節約綱要一般娛樂塲所之內。（三）目今節約中心，在於經濟，外匯一項，至爲重要。戲劇乃國人經營，由國人表演，國人觀賞，得之於國人仍用之於國人，利權全無外溢。（四）頻年以來，營業疲敝，今廈淡季數月更見蕭條，而平素營業，日多軍警滋事，損失不堪。唯一希望，但在秋凉，而一旦時間縮短，觀衆飯後到塲，已將劇終，同時名角名劇亦難排演。</p>

<h3>搶救工業危機建議　中央覆文答覆四點</h3>
<p>市參議會建議中央搶救工業危機一案，經行政院發交財政經濟兩部及四聯總處輸入臨時管理委員會核發後，茲已決定四項辦法，昨日覆文市府如下：</p>
<p>（一）關於繼續並續大生產貸款管理監督業務須嚴密一節，據四聯總處及經濟部核覆，目前對商業信用貸款雖加控制，惟對於日用必需品及生產事業仍繼續貸助，並組織巡廻稽核團專門稽核，以杜流弊。（二）關於寬放進口原料之外匯金額及分配方式，應側重民族工業部門及直接生產機稱一節，據輸入管理委員會核復，橡膠限額第一季原定爲一百十萬美元，第二季增加九十萬美元，合爲二百萬美元。仍感不敷，確爲事實，屆時自當注意。至工業原料直接分配於生產機構，如棉花直接分配於各紗廠，早經辦理有案。生橡皮則因機器設備無法調直，直接分配於各生產機構當尚有待。至原案建議分配側重民族工業及直接生產一節，據查進口原料物品係根據政府核定限額分配於各進口商，不論販賣商或生產商，概以戰前或戰後對於該項物品曾經進口及與國外確有聯絡之商號爲限，若以之分配於以前未經進口之廠商，與政府之規定不合。（三）關於協助並代辦生產原料之採購統籌統配一節，據經濟部核復，各地工商礦業原料之採購分配等事項，似應由各該業洽商本部各地工商輔導處協助辦理。（四）關於限制賦稅之按期遞增以扶植工業之發展一節，據財政部核復，現行各稅除出口稅業已取消，進口稅仍沿用民國廿三年進口稅則稅率征收，且係對外國貨課征外，至所得利得兩稅，係以外業營業之所得利得爲課征對象，並無按期遞增之規定。</p>
<h3>滬國產脚跳車廠商　赴京請願表示滿意　政府保證決不任日貨進口</h3>

<p>港僑總選　古井不波</p>
<p>我政府定期總選的消息發表後，港中英文報紙屢有批評，對我僑胞保持「兩重國籍」一點，尤表反感。港府發言人也說：我僑胞在港選舉，有違背國際公法，但中英雙方如果事前成立特別協定，則此種選舉，當可進行。又說：如果以委托方式舉行，而不須在港舉行民衆選舉集會者，亦非違法。外部兩廣特派員香港辦事處發言人，對此問題不允發表意見，但承認已向英方提出交涉。因此，直至目前爲止，港僑對總選運動，還是如古井裏一樣的平靜。</p>

<h3>吳市長招待記者　發表抑平米價辦法　宣司令下令嚴禁食米偷運出口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市米價近日突呈激漲，吳市長爲此甚爲焦急，正設法謀其抑平。並於昨日下午五時，在市政府會議室，招待各報記者，報告食米上漲之原因，並發表市府抑平米價之新措施，三點如下：</p>
<p>（一）疏通來源：產米區域因受戰亂影響，致來源减少，並聞有皖南等產米區有禁止食米出口之規定，現吳市長昨午已與行政院張院長通渦電話，張院長表示除飭各地開放禁令外，對於疏通上海食米來源辦法，行政院正積極辦理中。</p>
<p>（二）嚴禁走私：米價之上漲，與走私關係頗大，據市府獲得報告，蕪湖等產區，發現大量走私現象，走私對象爲日本及匪區。現糧食部已通令蕪湖產米祗准運往上海。</p>
<p>（三）增加配量：本月份起決增加配售食米七萬担，專供工人及貧民食用。按本市食米配量原爲每月十八萬担，現已增至廿五萬担，深信已足够分配。市府昨已與中央信託局接洽妥當，內即可加配。</p>
<p>吳市長未稱：兩星期後，新榖即可登塲，食米問題，當趨好轉矣。</p>
<p>又訊：淞滬警備司令宣鐵吾，以本市米價連日頗有波動，並據報有不肖份子，偷運食米出口情形，殊屬不法。十一日特下令禁止食糧出口，及無主管機關之證明文件者，一律查扣。此項命令，已飭水上稽查大隊嚴厲執行。</p>
<h3>調查米市場</h3>
<p>又訊；警局昨奉吳市長手令，調查本市南北兩米市塲，是否有非法抬高米價情事，結果如下：</p>
<p>關於甫米市塲者：（一）因傳傳聞湖南食米有被阻之說，皖北交通阻塞，來源突形稀少，各地產價報漲，而本市零銷活絡，添購不弱，各米價格均略趨高。</p>
<p>（二）本市陳米逐漸萎縮，而需要未减，人心看高。</p>
<p>（三）於檢查入塲證時，發現有漕河涇鎮五號陳恒泰米號陳實勤，以南昌路二號裕興盛米行客戶之臨時入塲證進塲，又馬浪路同豐義米行職員鍾春陽無證入塲，經提出身份證，並由南市米業市塲出具證明後，未予帶局。</p>
<p>（四）南市米市塲發給會員店之臨時入塲證毫無限制，且有效期爲一月，爲制止不法之徒或業外人乘機潛入高抬市價，似應飭知該塲負責人將臨時入塲證之數量予以規定，日期縮爲一日。</p>
<p>北米市塲方面，警局人員於上午十一時廿五分到達該處時，業已散市。（該處營業時間爲上午九時至十一時）據該市塲主任徐頌仁稱，米價漲因，爲產地價格高漲，及適值靑黃不接時，其嚴重性一時恐難消滅。</p>
<p>又警局奉吳市長手令，已派員嚴緝偷運食米出口情事。</p>
<h3>統一收購國棉暫難實現　紗布管理嚴格執行　民營紗廠自由買賣部份將取消</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於紡調會前議定之發展紡織工業調劑紗布供需實施方案，呈經濟部審核後，　以全國經委會認爲該方案，政府不能切實掌握物資，堅持欲予以修改，對棉花及紗布一律須統購統銷，並派請行政院副院長王雲五主持，另組審查小組會。該會特於九日在京舉行會議，到國行張總裁，財長俞鴻鈞，經長陳啓天，農長左舜生，及全經會委員等十餘人。六區棉紡公會特派唐星海，榮爾仁，劉丕基，吳味經等，前往自動提供意見。該會並召紡調會業務處長高秉泰，紡建公司總工程師劉文騰列席，有所傳詢。茲悉：該會經九十兩日審查會議結果，認爲統購棉花一節，採納各方意見，因統購國棉：（一）收棉資金，以六百萬担計算，需達十二萬億元，而週轉資金，至少需六萬億元，政府若發行如此鉅額資金，恐使通貨更形膨脹。（二）民營紗廠無棉可收，其所有資金，難免在市塲上作祟，甚易影響物價暴漲。（三）統購國棉，政府缺少大批技術人材。（四）各廠所需棉花品質不一，且紗錠亦有多寡，以目前運輸閑難情形，分配問題，勢難輕易解決。（五）各廠紗錠，良劵不一，製造時所需國棉數量，亦有多寡。政府如無大批專門人材，予以管制，反致使品質减低，生產效能銳减，而頗易浪費原料。（六）統購統銷，必需大批專門人材。在抗戰時，後方僅十六萬八千紗錠，當時管理人員需二千餘人，尚不能達到理想。今全國紗錠達四百餘萬枚之多，管理人員勢必更多。環顧國內，實無法羅致。以上各項問題，全經會認爲目前頗難解決。故決定對統一收購國棉，予以擱置。惟爲切實掌握紗布，易於訓劑供應，藉以平抑市價起見，決定對國民營紗廠之製成品紗布，全部澈底聯合配銷。對過去民營紗廠自由買賣部份，概予取消。聞該項方案，將俟呈准全經會審核通過後，即將交紡調會公布，付諸實施。</p>
<h3>食米見新高價</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧五千八百餘石，市勢因內地挺升，皖省運輸不甚爽快，長江來貨見慢，價目太高，店方行方均無貨，正遇秋忙不接，粳米步升一二萬元，早薄稻續加二三萬元，重見新高價。秈米亦帶起萬餘元，白元新粳均漲一二萬元，無錫崑山西路新粳，均已見新。</p>
<p>麵粉配售數量加增，利郎洋粉减低二萬元，市塲交易不動。廠粉雜牌粉四小一二千元，形勢已轉軟化。統粉平平，麩皮猛烈上騰，獨漲三五千元。</p>
<p>油市互有參差，生油去化仍懈，市况平平，蔴油亦少上落，淸油鮮有變動，菜油上落甚微，豆油異常俏俐，繼續劇漲六七萬元。</p>
<h3>沿長江各省市榖米小麥轉口須經糧部核准</h3>
<p>江海關昨日揭示第一五四號布告，略稱：案奉總稅務司令，奉財政部關務署代電，糧食部規定沿長江各省市榖米小麥三種糧食，如運出長江口外，轉至其他沿海省區銷售，一律須經糧食部核准。至麵粉出口，應依照麵粉限額轉口辦法辦理。又糧商運糧出長江口外之沿海各省區，須先經呈請糧食部核准後，除由糧食部批復知照，並分電起運地海關（或稅務機關），及江海關騐放外，各起運地海關（或稅務機關），即憑糧食部電文，及該糧商所持之部批，准予報關起運。另由江海關責成吳淞口關卡，予以檢查。凡未經糧食部核准者，即以私運論處，飭轉飭遵辦，幷對經由吳淞口出口之商運糧食，嚴密檢查，以杜偷運云云。</p>
<h3>聯總供應外棉　尙有十七萬包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：聯總運華之外棉，前後已到十四萬包。聞在聯總在華工作結束前，估計尙有外棉十七萬包，可運華供應云。</p>
<h3>國家行局差入　市面銀根又趨緊俏</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日國家行局在票據交換所共　入九〇六億元，銀根趨勢又告緊俏，唁息喊高至一角七分華股塲外多方貼息亦抬高至二角四分。各行局差出入細數，計中央差入四四億元，中國差入三八六億元，中農差入一四九億元，郵匯局差入六二億元，中信局差出五二億元，交通差出八三億元，外商銀行差入一四八億元，直接交換行莊差入二二一億元，代理交換行莊差出八三三億元。昨日國家行局鉅額之差入，內以食糖及紗布結款佔大宗云。</p>
<h3>美匯掛高五百元　其他各幣無變動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯市價昨經外匯平衡委會核定，又告誡整。計美匯基準價，經掛高爲四萬〇五百元，較前漲五百元。其飲英鎊，港幣，盧比各外幣匯率，則仍維原價。計英匯十二萬元，港匯七千五百元，盧比九千元。昨日指定銀行對美匯之買賣價，亦經調整計進四萬元，出四萬一千元。其他各種外幣買賣價，則無變動。</p>
<h3>存多紛紛斬售　華股一致疲跌</h3>
<p>華股昨逢掉期之日，刺激性毫無，存多在即交永紗中，源源斬售，使美匯市價掛高五百元之助買力量十分短暫。漲後復告步降，美亞所跌更多，連小型股新光景福亦感黯然無光，臨收成見低價。</p>
<p>晨初即交永紗開低至二三〇元，以致谷股均形見疲，遞永紗低至二四〇地。美匯市價掛大五百元，人心一振，一度躍升至即交二四二元，遞交二四八元。逢高有人脫售，現永紗又退至二三九元。塲外息價開一角六分半及二角一，間有開一角八及二角二分半者，形勢轉盤。無何紗價回小二十萬，復形不支。近午又迫低至二三二元及二三八低價，而後以二三三元及二三八元之價收市。收後喊價稍穩，午後塲外喊價曾回至二三九元。</p>
<p>結果較前收計即交股永紗信和勤興微挫，新華平平，中法小升，美亞華豐新光永公景福各跌半成，商務麗安尚平，中絲新亞降低半成不到，餘均微挫。遞交計永紗微升，新光景福美亞信和勤興均告低落，塲外各老股若中華世界閘北華商見低，餘尚平定。</p>
<p>現遞掉期交易，昨合息價九分至一角一，永紗貼價自六元三開後，由六元半退至五元六，而以五元入收市。美亞自十一元跌至八元半，仍以十一元結束。華豐在一元半至二元八間，新光在三元及四元半間，信和高價四元，低價二元八，而以三元結束。</p>
<p>大通紗廠辦理增資，今日起暫停賣買。閘北水電新股則於今日上市，成交單位暫定十萬股，優先股與普通股同樣交割，無分軒輊。</p>
<h3>兩經紀人罰停入塲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財經兩部駐證交監理官，近查證交第一四三號經紀人徐有祥，帳目有不符情事。第二一一號經紀人楊智昌，帳目不符，且有經營塲外交易之嫌，當一併呈部請示處理辦法，刻部方處理辦法頒到，當轉飭證交執行。證交昨特公告，自即日起，一四三號經紀人罰停入塲交易二週，二一一號經紀人罰暫停入塲交易云。</p>
<h3>印度赴日紗布考察團　談日本棉紡業實况</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕印度赴日紗布考察團一行多人，近日自日本視察完畢，過滬返國，據該團團長吉拉疆談稱：日本棉紡業，目前雖有工資低廉，設備優良等種種有利條件，惟以煤斤供應發生問題，且勞工短細，故預計至明年底時，日本棉紡界預期之四百萬紗錠之目標，恐仍不能開足·日本紗錠，目前减退爲二百二十萬錠·日貨廿支紗，每件現開價美金二百八十元·該團此行，並已與日訂立成交印棉十七萬包之合約·棉款以信用貸款方式，分十八個月撥付淸楚，年息三匣·聞印度棉紗價格之廉，冠於全世·廿支紗現每件僅四百四十膚比，每件折合美金僅一三七元五角云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據關係方面息：日本此次對印開價廿支紗每件美金二百八十元，我國棉紗，亦可照此價格出售，印紗布考察團此次過滬，亦曾與我關係方面一度非正式洽談，我方表示如印方有意輪入我國紗布，我亦極願考慮云。</p>
<h3>統債徘徊不定　外股愈盤愈俏</h3>
<p>公債昨榮辱俱微，徘徊不定。統丙晨開一三二〇〇元，自一三六〇〇元，步降至一二八〇〇元左右收市。北帮及五五五室賣出，五五〇室三六〇室五〇三室六一四室俱進，成交不過五百萬。結果較前收計甲乙戊均平，丙跌二百元，丁升二百元。</p>
<p>外股昨愈盤感好，洋商廣帮之供給，難饜證劵紗花兩大帮之猛吸。恰紗自晨開九四〇〇〇元起，午刻因港匯報縮，逼近十萬元大關。結果較前收計怡啤漲一成，怡紗業廣航業電話鋼業祥泰各升半成，餘均微升。</p>
<h3>人造絲無異動　廠經脚地堅硬</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午無異動，一二〇號有光二千五百九十萬元，賣出爲六百萬元。下午因本日外匯掛高，人心看好，最後升至六百五十萬元，比上日大五十萬元。東洋脾子貨缺銷殷，比金三馬等大起五十萬元，最後賣出價爲七百萬元，比上日大七十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>

<p>綢貨</p>
<p>開市時甚平穩，價與上日相仿。大誠與舉强價絲被面，先做四十三四萬元，後因供求失衡，乃告上揚，收市隔日期做二百六十萬元，格子璧縐喊價亦高五百元，但乏成交。華錦縐普通貨二萬五千元，民生花綈，漢汴等客，需求甚殷，昨市二萬七千元爲成交價。</p>

<h3>平民世紀的開拓者</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳　陳原著　開明本年六月初版</p>
<p>靑年們大多喜歡閱讀傳記，這是因爲傳記中的人物有一種强烈的吸引力量，能對之發生慷憬。一個歷史上的偉大人傑，憑他堅毅的精神和命運搏鬥，而成就赫赫的事功，自然應該受千萬人的愛敬和歌頌，但我們却不可把他看做是神或超人。以神或超人去看他，便易使我們的心裏上產生一種和他隔開的觀念，以爲他是可望而不可即的，以爲他是生活在現實的環境以外的，這樣反不是眞正的了解他了。</p>
<p>坊間所出的關於名人傳記的書籍，往往把書中人物描寫得像神一樣，像超人一樣，靑年們讀了，雖然發生禮讚欽仰，但却只有「膜拜」，很少因之而激動內心，進一步去效法他們。英雄豪傑是值得崇拜的，但我們却不必再教靑年以神或超人的眼光作不正確的英雄崇拜。傳統的歪曲的英雄崇拜的觀念是該打破了。</p>
<p>歷史上的偉大人傑，他們原也和我們一樣，具有血和肉，具有理智和感情，他們爲了人類，生活在人們中間，替大衆解除痛苦。傳記作家要把他們的傳大精神表現出來，自然應該把握住他們的眞實性格——具有人性的性格，如果把他們寫成神或超人，便失去了他們的眞實性格，縱令人心中產生追慕，那也不過當作神祗追慕，在讀者的內心中是不會有什麼感悟作用激勵作用的。</p>
<p>「平民世紀的開拓者」是陳原新著，這裏面所收的十三篇文章刻劃出這個空前偉大的平民世紀，有那些人傑曾經英勇地做過堅苦的開拓工作。這裏面的人物都可稱爲英雄，是眞正的英雄，和那些爲一己地位打算的所謂「出人頭地」的帝王，官僚，軍閥，統治者，資本家，豪門政客不同。他們的事業，是一連串的苦鬥，在艱難而孤寂的戰鬥中，受時代的考騐，畢竟完成了改造社會拯救人類的志願，</p>
<p>從這些英雄的事業中，我們可以看出他們的成就，完全由於他們動機的純良，工作的熟誠。從理想到實踐，我們找不到什麼奇蹟，看不出有一絲的僥倖。我們都能够學到他們，而且我們也應該學習他們。至於如何才能學到他們，那我們就必先對他們有正確而澈底的認識，認識他們苦鬥的過程，汲取他們的勇氣和精神，去滋養自己的生命，使自己的血液中也潑透進這些人民英雄的血液。巨人原是和我們一樣的人，明暸了他們之所以成爲巨人，然後我們便可以不再懷疑他們是神或超人人了。</p>
<p>對於這些歷史的人傑有了正確的認識，我們再逐一把他們略述一下。全書共分四輯，第一輯叙說羅斯福的偉大抱負及其功業，分述在三篇文章中。羅氏不但有開明的政治頭腦，而且且超越超越的識見，他的確不愧爲開拓民主世紀的先驅者，許多人都爲他的死而歎息：如果他還在　二次戰爭以後的世界不會如此紊亂吧。</p>
<p>第二輯的三篇文章，包括斯大林，加里寗及蘇聯的科學家。斯大林一篇前面引名詩人因紐希金的一首雄壯的歌，把一位偉大的革命者比做雄鷹。讀了「科學戰綫上的戰士們」一篇中，使我們了解蘇聯的科學家怎樣生活，以及許多科學家在這偶新世界裏面的預見，組織，工作和發展。他們的科學研究是爲了大衆的幸福，研究的成果馬上和實踐統一起來，工農業的電氣化，配合着工農業的高度進展。最後一節中附譯巴夫洛夫給青年的一封信，可作爲科學工作者的指針。</p>
<p>第三輯寫的是法蘭克林，湯姆斯·潘恩，尼赫魯三人。法蘭克林的偉大在於「一個通俗化的科學家，一個精於事業的實行家，一個勇敢的民主主義的鬥士，三種人格集合在他一身」。一個印刷工人出身的窮苦孩子，至今還活在美國人的記憶裏，並不是偶然的。寫潘恩，作者用「人權的追求」一個標題多令我們嚮往。潘恩的這部劃時代的名著「人的權利」刊行於一百五十五年前。現在正是人民世紀，我們讀了這篇生動精懲的「人的權利」誕生的故事，應該有怎樣深切的意義。關於尼赫魯，僅寫了他的前半生。尼赫魯說：「監獄是我的第二家庭」。是的，革命家在獄中進進出出，不就和在家庭中進進出出一樣嗎？監獄的生活把革命者鍛鍊得更堅强，更勇敢。</p>
<p>第四輯的四篇所寫的是羅曼羅蘭，托爾斯泰，魯迅，威爾斯。這四位文化部門的先知者，都曾在他們的筆暴露過肚會的醜惡，爲人民而呼喊。羅曼羅蘭確是歐洲智　的燈塔，他的思想的光輝永遠照耀於人間。正義所在，羅氏的思想所在，眞理所在，羅氏的思想所在。托爾斯泰也同樣偉大他於羅氏逝後兩年即一九四五年二月辭別人世，他的不朽的文學遺產已不僅屬於蘇聯的，而是全世界全人類的。魯迅先生更是中華民族空前的文化鬥士，他的反帝反對建反法西斯的思想種于已經在中國的每個角落發出芽來。一身而兼科學家，歷史家，思想家的威爾斯不久以前逝世，他永遠懷着希望，所有的著作中對人類將來的歷史始終看着樂觀的一面。</p>
<p>這本書行文的淸麗明快，叙述的生動活潑，都能使讀者發生興趣，所寫的人物雖是多樣多面，但却都同樣給這些巨人還原做一個人，不是生長在烏托邦中的「傳奇」人物內中選用的好些圖像，更能令人見了頓起親切　慕之感。這是靑年人良好的修養讀物，自我教育的歌材。</p>
<h3>宣傳心理研究</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>（薩空了編譯·耕耘出版社版）</p>
<p>近代學術界，應用心理學去研究各種科學，已有顯著的進步；如教育心理學，犯罪心理學，文藝心理學，及商業心理學等等，本着心理學的理論從而詳考各種問題及觀點，右理論興實踐上，均有很好的成效。「宣傳心理研究」一書，便是由心理學爲出發，去分析探討宣傳上的種種問題。細讀全書的內容，已見部分地發揮了兒童心理學，差異心理學，社會心理學，變態心理學，和應用心理學的理論。然本書的目的不僅在此，它主要的是針對着納粹法西斯的宣傳方法，用心理學解釋納粹法西斯的欺騙宣傳手段何以能成長，然後再證明其終至失敗的原因。</p>
<p>譯者是從英人華特（Amber　Blanco　White）听著「新宣傳」（The　New　Propaganda）一書編譯而成。華特寫這本書的目的是在討論納粹法西斯的宣傳方法，可否爲英國的進步政黨所採用，但編譯渚把內容擴大了，其目的在使中國讀者明暸納粹法西斯宣傳的性質，影嚮及其必然的結果。</p>
<p>全書共分三部：第一部，獨裁者心目中的宣傳；第二部，人的接受宣傳的綠因；第三部，獨裁政府的宣傳統治所得到的心理效果。每部再分五章或六章，尤以第二部所論的如「論羣衆」，「論領袖」，「焦急，犯罪意念與敵意」，「人民與統治者」，「幸福的代用品」等各章，立論新穎，發掘深入，讀之發人深省！第三部所論各音，因爲涉及的問題過於廣泛，所以叙述顯得瑣碎散漫；若以這第三部與第一部作爲比照，拿來說明納粹法西斯宣傳成敗兩者的印證，則力量似乎還欠短少。但原著者因深受奧國現代著名心理學家弗洛特（Freud）的學說之影響，將心理學試用於研究政治經濟的現象，歸結到宣傳心理學上的問題；其研究的方法，注意社會的根源，偏重人類心理的分析。以這一點而言，那麼本書仍很有學術上的價值。</p>
<p>以宣傳作爲政治上的工具，遠在我國春秋戰國時代，商鞅曾有布告移竿重賞，和布告移竿重懲的故事，那時就是以宣傳樹立政府成信的。然眞正利用宣傳作爲政治鬥爭的武器，是到了二十世紀初葉，才從歐洲開始；及至法西斯的意大利和納粹的德國，便完全是玩弄了宣傳變成政治上最有力的武器，緊抓住人民心理的反應，竟至發動侵略的戰爭。過去在戰時，我們常談到「神經戰」的問題，這就是希特勒瘋在的運用了心理戰術到了登峰造極的時候；侵略者對內給人民在心理上造成焦急，犯罪意念與敵意，對外以進攻掠奪尋求滿足。但是他們終於因爲欺騙了人民，自食其果，慘敗毀滅！這是留給後世一個很大的教訓。</p>
<p>現在第二次世界大戰結束後，不幸的，人類還是過着焦急的，心理不安的生活。目前美蘇兩大集團，表現着政治與經濟上種種的對壘，彼此大事宣傳爭特不決；其實這些情形，也就是在運用着心理戰術的軒輊頡頏。然而，歷史已經沉痛的啓示了我們，要使宣傳發生效力，一定要使宣傳能與接受宣傳者的心理相調合，這就是說我們必然要了解大衆的心理狀態。經過第二次慘厲的戰爭後，大衆唯一的所需要者，是世界的和平，與企望着幸福繁榮的生活，所以我們實無理由再在人類的心理上製造焦急，犯罪意念與敵意的事件，重蹈法西斯納粹的覆轍！</p>
<p>本書在導言中曾說：「研究宣傳，可帮助人民了然宣傳與他們有切身的利害而能所警戒；也可使政府了然宣傳的眞價值，濫用不只無利且有弊害，不復以宣傳爲政治的萬應靈藥，而認淸只有眞正民主始能使國內安定。……本書的研究中心雖置於納粹法西斯國家的宣傳政策上，但其目的却不只是爲了研究他們的宣傳政策，，而是希望讀者能够舉一反三，由此攝取到更有用的實際知識」。</p>
<p>我讀完了這本書，想到了舉世的大局，心情感到輕鬆也覺得沉重。我想讀者們，都是關心時勢的，若讀了這本書，可能給你們一些益處。</p>

<h3>郁茹的「遙遠的愛」</h3>
<p>首先說明的是，這本書已存許多人介紹過了，茅盾先生的序，是這本書的最好的詮釋，無論結構佈局，寫作技巧，人性刻劃各面，短短的二三千字中已說盡了本曰霍的長處和缺點。</p>
<p>但我還是想吐露一下我的觀感。「遙遠的愛」是一個新人成長的傳記，是一個戰士和內心戰鬥，和環境戰鬥的紀錄，這裏面有太多的時代氣息，她寫出了時代青年的喜怒哀樂，其中也有你的一份，我的一份。「從一粒沙子中看世界」，也許你我的獲得未心盡同，但坦白說出這些瑣碎的印象，決無損於這本紀錄時代脈搏跳動的書。</p>
<p>一個崇高的女性，然而不是虛幻的形象，她是有血有肉的，她是這個時代的產物。茅盾說得好：</p>
<p>「羅維娜的時代，和二十多年前她的母親輩的時代可以說是不同了，也可以說仍然有點地方相同。二十多年前的娜拉，從禮教的圈子，從傀儡的家庭中，挺身出走，要做一個「堂堂的人」。現今的羅維娜，則要從狹小的自私的愛的圈子，從針適的然而使人麻痺的生活環境中，掉臂面去。」</p>
<p>作者郁茹以「女性作家擅長的抒情氣氛，」仔細分析了女主角羅維娜和「自私的愛」鬥爭的心理過程。是時代使羅維娜的慧眼看透了一切；也是時代，使羅維娜和她的丈夫保特了一個距離。他滿可以在小家庭中舒適地安排一生，可是經過一番掙扎，她終於跳出了這個狹小的籠。時代是決定一切的力量，它浩蕩澎湃，向前奔騰，衝洗了多少沙石和污泥，可是又是誰在領導這股不可抗拒的力量呢？——還是人，還是受過了時代的影響，從而又來影嚮時代的羅維娜們。</p>
<p>可愛的是羅維娜的覺醒，不，更可愛的是羅維娜覺醒後的心理鬥爭，和經過殘酷的心理鬥爭後付諸實施的她的行動。</p>
<p>高原不了解她。——作爲一個小妻子，他是了解她的；作爲一個社會鬥士，她的舉止遠超過他的了解以外。</p>
<p>雷嘉也未必了解她——或許雷嘉比較了解這時代，也比較和她貼近些，可是一個「羅亭型」的人物，能說不能行，即使更明白了這時代的需要，他仍不會完全明白他們自己的需要。或即使稍稍理解了，可是他們只是「言語的巨人，行動的侏儒。」</p>
<p>羅維娜是正常的，是平凡的，她沒有過多的英雄性格，並不好出風頭，她只是按照時代需求於她的去做，她做了，——絲毫沒有錯。</p>
<p>可是在雷嘉和高原的眼裏，她變成怎樣的一個人物了呢？——當高原悄悄地間雷嘉：「你向她求過婚了吧？」「沒有的事，在她，我們不是她的匹配，……她是魔鬼，她是神，而不是人！他們一家子都是這樣的！」這是雷嘉的回答。</p>
<p>使我們感動的是，高原和羅維娜怎樣由一種單純的愛而結婚了，結婚以後於是只賸下了情慾。高原是愛她的，然而他所愛的不是她的認識，了解，覺醒…而是作爲小妻子的一面。她也愛高原的，然而她在這單純的愛中發覺了不足和不滿。他倆之間怎樣發生了距離，又經過怎樣的心理鬥爭，羅維娜越過了高原的羈絆，走向自己的路。這一切的過程，作者都寫得有聲有色。</p>
<p>我想說明的是：羅維娜在我們眼裏看來很逼眞，並不因了她的英雄性格而有所破損，我以爲這是作者在女主角身上濯注了「人性」的綠故。作者微妙地寫出她的心理變化，一層深似一層，因此，她的舉止在我們看來，並無絲毫突如其來之感。</p>
<p>高原誤解了她的時候，她是痛苦的。</p>
<p>「我得不到他的諒解，」她喃喃自語着，「他不會了解我，根本他還沒有去了解整個時代，……在我們中間，已經躺着一條很深的鴻溝了。我不能再回去。這些時來，我以嚴酷的意志鞭策自己，甚至連停留喘息的時間都沒有。但是，我還是只能無止息地前進。……」</p>
<p>她是理智的化身。她看得深刻，想得深刻，因此，她也工作得很沉着。但她不是沒有情感的人，當高原另有所愛，來信向她示威，把兩者間保持着的一點單純的愛也毀了時，她的痛苦是異乎尋常的——她因此病了三個星期。</p>
<p>一個有血有肉的人，一個敢愛敢憎的人，一個能够把持理智，控制情感的人，——原來，她也只是一個平凡的人。可是她對這世界陌生，這世界對她也陌生，社會不能容納她，朋友，甚至丈夫也不能瞭解她。她如果是一個勇者，她就得和環境戰鬥下去；她如果屈服了，「家鴿」的命運在等待她。</p>
<p>這個平凡的人，我們却稱之爲「一個新人」。這是時代的悲劇——並非她不够接近我們，而是我們由於若干自私心理，不敢和她貼近，不是她有什麼錯誤，使我們無法接近，而是我們有了太多的弱點，在這些弱點未洗雪盡淨前，我們養於接近她，甚至羞於面對面地瞥她一眼。</p>
<p>然而，她終會慢慢地影響我們的吧；因爲由於她的戰鬥成果，她就要影響這個時代。</p>

<h3>Continued Joint Meeting of Party Groups: Lively Discussion of Organizational Outlines; Content of Political Outlines Still Requires Supplementation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the joint meeting of party groups continued its session at 9:30 AM on the 11th. Chairman Sun Ke presided. Over 280 Central Executive Committee members, Supervisory Committee members, and central cadres and supervisors of the Youth League attended. The assembly listened to two important reports. First, General Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, gave a report on Xinjiang and answered inquiries regarding the Baitashan incident. Next, Gu Zhengding, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department, gave a report on the Communist Party issue, offering a severe criticism of the CCP. After a 20-minute break, the assembly continued discussing the "Party's New Construction Outline" and the "Radical Reform Outline." The two outlines had already been merged into a single proposal by the Proposal Organizing Committee of the joint meeting of party groups. This morning's discussion focused on the "Political Outline" portion. Attendees continued to express their opinions until 12:00 PM, when the chairman adjourned the meeting. In the afternoon, starting at 3:30 PM, President Chiang Kai-shek chaired the session to discuss the draft of the Kuomintang Reform Outline proposed by the Organizing Committee. This draft was compiled by the Organizing Committee based on the "Party's New Construction Outline Draft," the "Party's Reform Outline Draft," and the opinions expressed during the previous days' sessions. It consists of two parts: (1) Current Organizational Outline, and (2) Current Political Outline. The latter was discussed first. Liang Hancao, convener of the Organizing Committee, explained the compilation process. Cheng Zhongxing, Lin Lin, Zhang Daofan, Zhang Zhijiang, Li Shizeng, He Haoruo, and others then spoke, offering opinions on disciplining the military, exposing corruption, recruiting talent, promoting national sports, and fostering a spirit of mutual aid and struggle. After a 10-minute break at 5:00 PM, the chairman announced that the content of the Political Outline still needed to be supplemented and would be submitted to the Presidium for research before further discussion. Then, the Organizational Outline was presented. Huang Shaogu, convener of the Organizing Committee, explained it, and the chairman presented each article for discussion. Attendees enthusiastically expressed their opinions. The atmosphere at the meeting was harmonious. Several items were amended and passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The joint meeting of party groups will continue on the 12th to discuss this outline.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The joint meeting of party groups continued its session at 3:00 PM on the 11th. The President presided. Speakers were very enthusiastic, but due to time constraints, only the discussion on the party member section of the Current Organizational Outline was completed by 7:00 PM. The full text is as follows: As the Party and Youth League unify their organization and concentrate revolutionary forces to carry out the tasks of the later stages of the revolution, a thorough review of the Party's organization should be conducted to improve shortcomings, strive for enrichment and progress, adapt to the demands of the times, and nurture the driving force for the construction of a new China. Therefore, this Party Reform Outline is specially formulated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Current Organizational Outline: (1) Principles: 1.

Absorb outstanding farmers, workers, and young intellectuals as the main force of the revolution to strengthen the Party's social foundation. 3. Establish the Party's style during the constitutional era, improve organizational operation. In the future, Party departments at all levels should strive to serve the people, earnestly improve the people's lives, alleviate their suffering, and increase their intellectual level. 4. Based on the Party's principle of democratic centralism, leading cadres at all levels should be elected democratically, with the minority subordinating to the majority and the majority respecting the minority. The President leads the entire Party, and the lower levels subordinate to the upper levels. Agencies at all levels should regularly submit work reports to Party members, and Party members should earnestly review work and offer candid mutual criticism. 5. Strengthen the spirit of learning, create a research atmosphere, and improve the theoretical level of Party members to achieve the effect of reforming thought and improving propaganda.</p>
<p>(2) Party Members: (1) Re-establish Party membership standards. A. Those who meet the following conditions may become Party members: 1.

Those who create or participate in small organizations within the Party to undermine the Party's unity. 4. Those who have corrupt behavior. 5. Those who do not truthfully register their property. (2) Party members and Youth League members should all re-register and take an oath (oath to be found elsewhere).

The specific measures will be determined separately.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Reports to the Plenary Session: Three Stages of the Xinjiang Problem; Stability Must Be Sought in Construction in the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] General Zhang Zhizhong, who arrived in Nanjing yesterday, reported on the Xinjiang issue at the joint meeting of the Central Party and Youth League on the morning of the 11th. After briefly describing the past and present situation of Xinjiang, Zhang made a prediction of the future situation. According to Zhang's report: Speaking of the past of Xinjiang, of course, we cannot talk about the too distant past. We must start from the time when Zuo Zongtang arrived in Xinjiang or when Xinjiang was established as a province. However, what I want to talk about today is the past situation of Xinjiang from the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government in 1944 until Maisud became chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government in May of this year. This period can be divided into three stages: The first stage was the military period. The Yining Incident began on November 7, 1944. As everyone knows, when Sheng Shicai left Xinjiang, the Central Army was fighting the War of Resistance. However, in order to rescue the people of Xinjiang and recover the national territory, the Central Government transferred a small number of troops to Xinjiang. However, after Chairman Wu Zhongxin took office for less than a month, riots broke out in Yining. The Central Army was weak in Xinjiang, and due to weather, supplies, and other reasons, it had to withdraw, and Yining was lost. In September 1945, rebellions broke out again in Yining. The three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan all fell. During this period, because it was at the beginning of the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Central Government, in order to strive for domestic peace, sent me to Xinjiang. President Chiang instructed me to save the crisis, stabilize Xinjiang, and deal with the Xinjiang issue with the Central Government's peaceful policies. After I arrived in Xinjiang, I negotiated with Yining. It took eight months to reach an agreement. This can be regarded as the stage of peaceful negotiations. Until July 1 last year, the Xinjiang Provincial Government was reorganized according to the peace terms. Six committee members from Yining participated in the provincial government, but only four committee members actually took office. Until May 28 this year, when Maisud was ordered to be the chairman of the province, the situation in Xinjiang transitioned from military action and peaceful negotiation to the stage of political struggle. Over the past year, I have discovered that Yining attempted to use the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan as a base to develop to the remaining seven districts to specialize them, and then use special means to control the Xinjiang regime. In May, when I inspected southern Xinjiang, I discovered the seriousness of this situation and had to suggest that the Central Government find ways to restrain the development of this trend, and suggested that I resign from the position of chairman of the new province, and Maisud take over as chairman. The above is a rough overview of the past situation. The current situation in Xinjiang should start from Maisud's appointment as chairman until all the members of the Yining Provincial Government withdrew. In these three months, according to common sense, since the Central Government appointed Maisud as chairman, there was no reason for Yining to oppose it. Maisud's Uighur (i.e., Turkic) ethnicity accounts for 90% of the entire population of Xinjiang. It is the majority ethnic group among the ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Maisud's appointment as chairman can prove that the Central Government respects ethnic minorities. Unfortunately, after Maisud's appointment was announced, the people of Yining were in an uproar and opposed it, and still asked me to continue to preside over the provincial government. This is truly a contradictory phenomenon. However, in the eyes of the people of Yining, it is not contradictory, because they have their own understanding, psychology, and attempts. The situation has become deadlocked. The Central Government's order cannot be changed, and Yining has also expressed its final decision. Therefore, after the opening of the New Provincial Council, it did not become a meeting. I tried to mediate, but it was still ineffective. Currently, the committee members of the Yining Provincial Government and the staff of various agencies in Yining have all withdrawn. This can be regarded as their final attitude. For this reason, on September 1, I sent a letter to the people of Yining with three questions: (1) Whether they intend to unilaterally tear up the peace agreement, (2) Whether they intend to launch another armed rebellion and are willing to bear the responsibility for destroying peace, (3) If they do not have the above two intentions, whether they are willing to come to peace talks again. However, this letter had not yet reached Yining when I learned of it on the 8th when I left Dihua. Currently, we are waiting for a reply. As for the future situation in Xinjiang, I dare not make a definite judgment on how it will develop, but what I can report to the assembly is that, judging from today's situation in Xinjiang, it will not deteriorate too much. It seems that there will be no more armed rebellions. Of course, we cannot be too optimistic and careless. What's more, the future of the Xinjiang issue will not depend on Yining's attitude, but everything should be sought from ourselves. Generally, there are three views on the Xinjiang issue: (1) The Xinjiang issue is a diplomatic issue, (2) The Xinjiang issue is a ethnic issue, (3) The Xinjiang issue is a problem intertwined with diplomatic and ethnic issues. However, to solve this problem in the future, we should take both ethnic and diplomatic approaches, especially from the Central Government's standpoint, we should first focus on ethnic issues. Today's Xinjiang is a Xinjiang illuminated by the brilliance of the Three Principles of the People. As Party members, we should faithfully implement the Three Principles of the People policy in that area. Among the 4 million people in Xinjiang, more than 3 million recognize the Central Government and support the Central Government. The majority of the remaining 700,000 people in the three districts of Yining are also forced by tyranny and dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Over the past few years, the ethnic policy has been implemented in Xinjiang. The most important thing now is to actively promote the policy of the People's Livelihood, because the people of Xinjiang are the poorest, and their culture, education, and everything else are backward, but what is hidden under the soil is the most abundant. Zhang emphasized at the end: The Xinjiang crisis is over today. Xinjiang will always be Xinjiang of the Republic of China. The question is how to build Xinjiang in the future, because building Xinjiang is the only good way to stabilize Xinjiang and win the people's hearts.</p>
<h3>Party Member's Oath: Oath of a Chinese Kuomintang Party Member</h3>
<p>"I solemnly swear to believe in the teachings of Premier Sun Yat-sen, to join this Party, to strive to realize the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution in a new China, and to obey resolutions, abide by discipline, implement political programs and policies, accept the leadership of the President, share weal and woe, be of one heart and one mind, and carry through to the end. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe sanctions from this Party. I solemnly swear."</p>
<h3>The Chairman Sternly Denounces the Mentality of Relying on Foreign Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] Chairman Chiang delivered a speech at the joint meeting of party groups last night. After analyzing the current situation, he said: Our economic, political, and military situations are not dangerous. If the Kuomintang Party members can strictly follow the government's orders, the economic situation will naturally stabilize and improve. People from all walks of life sympathize with the Kuomintang, and the people also support the National Government. The Communist Party is now doomed in China. When the war ended, I originally planned to issue new currency. At that time, there were 900 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange that could be used as a fund, but it was shelved because financial and economic experts believed that it could not be done without foreign aid. This kind of psychology of relying on foreigners is unlikely to succeed. If this plan could have been accepted at that time, today's situation would have been completely different. Now, in terms of economy and military affairs, if foreign aid can be obtained immediately, success will be achieved sooner. However, without foreign aid, the government can still overcome this difficulty, but it will take longer.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Organizes Northeast Relief Association to Raise Funds to Help Refugees in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Madame Chiang discussed Northeast relief matters with Mo Dehui and Yu Bin from the Northeast at her official residence at 5:00 PM on the 11th. It was decided to establish the Northeast Relief Committee, with Madame Chiang as the chairman, and 15 to 20 relevant people from the Northeast will be hired as committee members. Raising relief funds will be completed within two weeks. The main work is to provide relief to the flood-stricken areas in the Northeast and the refugees in Sipingjie.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee to Hold First Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Fourth Plenary Meeting of the Sixth Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang was previously decided by the Standing Committee to hold its first meeting at 1:00 PM on the 12th at the Committee. After the meeting, all committee members will still participate in the Plenary Meeting of the Central Executive Committee of this session.</p>
<h3>Low Appeal from Hainan Island</h3>
<p>— Bu Shaofu</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes from a Southern Tour, No. 5 (Part 1)</p>
<p>After the C47 aircraft took off from Baiyun Airport, my mind was imagining the solitary island in the South China Sea that I would reach in two hours. In the subtropical zone, what kind of face does it have?</p>
<p>Since this southern journey, Hainan Island is the only unfamiliar place that has not been visited by all members of our small group. Except for Mr. S who bombed Xiuying Port with American fighter planes during the war, and except for me who took a sea liner from Hong Kong to Haiphong before the Pearl Harbor incident and anchored outside Haikou Port for three hours and was subjected to enemy inspection, our past knowledge of Hainan Island was a blank piece of paper for everyone.</p>
<p>I was imagining, and my companions were also imagining:</p>
<p>Palm trees, coconut groves, towering everywhere. In the moonlight, men playing guitars, women humming tropical love songs, a group of sitting men, women, old and young clapping in rhythm...</p>
<p>The flood-stricken area of the Xijiang River overflows. This tragic scene was exposed under the wings, disappointing us Honolulu daydreamers.</p>
<p>No one found the Honolulu impression until four days later when we left Hainan Island. Although we only lingered in Haikou, and even the nearest Wenchang was not visited, all the friends we contacted in Jiaji, Lehui, Wanning, and even Danxian smiled and told us that this beautiful reverie was probably an infection from Hollywood movie scenes. At this time, we couldn't help but admit it.</p>
<p>Zhudao, Zhuyai, Qiongzhou, Qiongyai, these are all names for Hainan Island. This island with an area of nearly 100,000 square li is geographically similar to Hong Kong. Hong Kong faces the Kowloon Peninsula across the sea. Hainan Island is like a pearl in the mouth of the Leizhou Peninsula. However, Hainan Island is almost a thousand times larger than Hong Kong, and the narrowest sea distance between it and the Leizhou Peninsula is also four times greater than Hong Kong and Kowloon. This is a very interesting geographical reprint, the difference being in large and small sizes only.</p>
<p>In fact, the urban landscape of Haikou, that kind of mood, is somewhat like Guangzhou Bay, and somewhat like Haiphong. And what is presented is clutter, lifelessness, and all activities of people seem aimless. I had this feeling in Beijing and Shenyang two months ago, and I was also puzzled by this atmosphere in Hankou and Changsha this time. This is a universal internal injury, a basic decline, and it was unseen in various cities during the War of Resistance. The air is very quiet, but it cannot hide the anxiety in people's hearts. The question of restructuring has been delayed for nearly a year, and administrative agencies at all levels from the commissioner's office down cannot be unaffected by it. Four hours after we arrived in Haikou on August 9, at a symposium held by Cai Jinjun, the commissioner of Qiongyai (District 9) in Coconut Garden, I asked him about this issue. He replied very simply: "As long as I am in office for one day, I will work for one day." From this sentence, I dare not guarantee that he has longer-term plans, and I dare not guarantee that everyone under him can be so calm.</p>
<p>Coconut Garden (place name) used to be the headquarters of the Japanese Hainan Island Expeditionary Army. The houses are all Japanese-style, and there are still grass mats in Cai's office. However, the scenery in the garden is full of tropical scenery. Except here in Haikou, you can see clusters of lush coconut groves. You can only appreciate the charm of these forests when you get to Wenchang. Coconut Garden has now been decided to allocate to Hainan University as the school site. This vast reclaimed land on the beach will be a good place for students to relax their minds in the future.</p>
<h3>Sun Liren Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Sun Liren completed his inspection mission in Guangzhou and flew back to Nanjing from Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Research Association on Japanese Issues Decides to Submit Opinions to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Research Committee on Japanese Issues, composed of committee members stationed at the Senate, held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 11th. Mo Dehui presided. Huang, the Director of the East Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attended to report on the content of the Japanese Peace Treaty and other general related issues. After the participants expressed their opinions, it was decided to prepare a written opinion and send it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for reference.</p>
<h3>Candidates for the Reparations Material Transportation and Supervision Committee Have Been Internally Decided</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Transportation and Supervision Committee established to handle Japanese reparations materials will be established soon. It has been internally decided that Qin Fen will serve as the chairman, and committee members will be personnel from the Ministry of Communications and other relevant agencies. The first lottery is tentatively scheduled for the 15th.</p>
<h3>The Four-Banks Joint Treasury Approves Increased Loans for Salt and Tea</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Four-Banks Joint Treasury held its 352nd board meeting on the morning of the 11th. Yu Hongjun acted as the chairman and passed three important cases:</p>
<p>(1) Salt loan quotas for the Shanghai and Changlu areas were decided. The production and sales loans for the Shanghai area will be increased by a total of 46 billion yuan, bringing the total to 89.9 billion yuan. The production and sales loans for the Changlu area were approved at 29.4 billion yuan.</p>
<p>(2) This year's tea loan was resolved: 1. According to the actual situation, the pledge amount per dan will be increased to 1.4 million yuan for Qihong, 1.2 million yuan for Tunlv, 1 million yuan for Pinglv, 1 million yuan for Ninghong, 800,000 yuan for Minhong, and 800,000 yuan for Wenhong. 2. Those whose quality does not meet the standards will not be mortgaged. 3. The maximum mortgage period is two months. If it is not redeemed by the due date, the China Farmers Bank will dispose of the mortgaged goods and absolutely no extensions are allowed. 4.

<h3>Case of the United Logistics Command Embezzling and Selling Military Cloth: Ma Fengbo Sentenced to Death</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Uses Puyi to Build a Puppet Organization in the Northeast; American Expert Writes an Article on the Soviet Union's Refusal to Extradite</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] According to Yang, an expert on Far Eastern issues: The Soviet Union may want to support Puyi, the "Manchu" puppet emperor, and establish a Communist province in the Northeast. Yang wrote a special article for the Hearst newspaper today, stating: The Soviet Union's refusal to extradite Puyi to the Chinese government may be preparing to send Puyi to the Northeast to serve as "the head of the proletarian government, becoming a pro-Soviet buffer state, completely the same as when Japan used Puyi from 1931 to 1935." Yang said: "It seems contrary to common sense for a communist country to set up a monarch, but in terms of Puyi's strange fate in his life, it is not inconsistent." The article pursues the Soviet Union's unilateral establishment of a "convention" with Puyi in 1935, selling the Sino-Soviet jointly owned Middle East Railway in the Northeast for 40 million yuan. However, the Soviet Union did not give China a penny. Since the pro-Soviet Yalta Agreement, the Soviet Union has now obtained joint control of the Northeast Railway. The 40 million yuan that the Soviet Union obtained from selling the railway in 1935 is now not mentioned at all. Yang supports our country's request, claiming: Puyi should be returned to China to be tried for treason, because Puyi is the abdicated emperor of China, so he is a citizen of China. He and Japan jointly rebelled against his own country, so he should be tried for treason and war crimes.</p>
<h3>Amidst Calls for a Peace Conference with Japan, the U.S. Emphasizes China's Stance; Marshall States Negotiations with Various Nations Will Commence</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 10th] Regarding the rumored statement by Chinese Premier Zhang Qun in his speech, suggesting that China would not participate in a peace conference with Japan if the Soviet Union did not attend, official sources here expressed astonishment tonight. According to well-informed sources, the United States has not received formal notification of this position from the Chinese side. However, U.S. government officials acknowledge that if China were to adopt such a stance, it would further complicate the prospect of an early peace conference with Japan. Chinese sources here suggest that Zhang Qun's remarks may have been misinterpreted. As far as the embassy is aware, China's current position remains consistent with its response last month to the U.S. proposal. The point of disagreement between China and the U.S. was the U.S. proposal to abolish the veto power in the conference and replace it with a three-out-of-four majority vote among the major powers to make decisions. This modification of the veto power would prevent any single power from dissenting. Therefore, China informed the U.S. that it would be willing to reconsider its position if other countries had different opinions. It is reported that some members of the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission believe that China is likely to adopt this stance.</p>
<p>According to sources close to the Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission, China's views at recent meetings of the Commission have shifted closer to the Soviet Union's position, with growing concerns that the U.S. will rebuild Japan on too grand a scale. If China were to adopt this position, and both the Soviet Union and China did not participate, the U.S. would need to re-evaluate the entire issue of a peace conference with Japan.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, U.S. officials are currently planning to issue invitations to the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission, inviting them to the U.S. to hold preliminary meetings on Japan during the UN General Assembly session. It is acknowledged that the Soviet Union may refuse to participate, as the Soviets have twice notified the U.S. that the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan should be handled by the Council of Foreign Ministers, not by the eleven nations. However, the U.S., with the support of the British Commonwealth, the Philippines, and other countries, is reportedly proceeding with the plan. Official sources also acknowledge that if China aligns with the Soviet Union, the situation will change completely. The U.S. risks proceeding with the conference without Soviet participation, but cannot do so without the participation of both China and the Soviet Union. Some sources believe that even if China adopts this position, U.S. and British influence may still persuade them to adopt their original approach.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 10th] Marshall stated today at a press conference that the U.S. is currently negotiating with ten relevant countries regarding the peace treaty with Japan. However, he declined to comment on whether a preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan could be convened during the UN General Assembly session.</p>

Minister Gu first reported on the significance of the association's establishment, stating that in order to achieve peaceful unification as soon as possible, it is necessary to encourage frontline soldiers to strengthen their fight against the rebellion. During the War of Resistance, we organized the National Comforting Association, which had a positive effect on boosting morale. Although the current war is internal, striving for national independence and freedom means that suppressing the internal rebellion is a continuation of the War of Resistance. Therefore, we should respect and encourage the soldiers to achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country. Peng Erkang of the Central Party Headquarters then declared that today's meeting welcomes the Central Military Comforting Delegation, and that the comforting work for new recruits in various places has been best performed in Shanghai.

<p>[Our Peiping Dispatch, 11th] The proposal to improve military discipline and administration submitted by the Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei Military and Administrative Supervisory Group to the National Government is reportedly divided into three parts: a preamble, methods, and an introduction. It analyzes the causes of corruption in military discipline and administration in great detail. There are twelve points regarding methods to rectify military discipline: (1) Improve soldiers' pay. (2) Office expenses and non-staple food expenses should be adjusted according to the price index. (3) Military rations and clothing should be delivered on time, and attention should be paid to their quality. (4) The price of non-staple food and horse feed for the military should be based on market prices. (5) The use of troops should be coordinated with personnel relationships. (6) Political and military affairs should be closely coordinated. (7) Officers and soldiers should live together. (8) Strengthen military training. (9) The military and local governments should closely cooperate. (10) Rewards and punishments should be clear, from top to bottom. (11) Strengthen the organization and training of the masses. (12) Strengthen the people's armed forces. The administrative section proposes: (1) Improve the salaries of civil servants to maintain a minimum standard for a family of five. (2) Agency expenses should be matched to the actual work. (3) Consolidate redundant agencies and eliminate superfluous staff. (4) Simplify and unify laws and regulations. (5) Civil servant salaries in the same region should be equal, and the salaries of employees of state-owned production agencies should be equal to those of ordinary civil servants. The special treatment of civil servants close to the front lines or those who are rushing to repair railways should be improved. (6) Rewards and punishments should be clear, with equal emphasis on rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei Military and Administrative Supervisory Group telegraphed the National Resources Commission on the 11th, requesting an investigation into Yu Changju, manager of the Peiping branch of the Hebei Electric Power Company, because his poor management of personnel and machinery has caused repeated breakdowns in the Jingshan power plant, plunging Peiping into darkness.

<h3>Guangdong Province Rectifies Administration; A Large Number of County Magistrates Dismissed or Transferred</h3>

According to sources in the provincial government, a large number of county magistrates may still need to be adjusted in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Coal Supply for This Winter is Not Expected to be Scarce; Coal Shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area Can be Avoided; The Ministry of Economic Affairs No Longer Controls Household White Coal for Residents</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the coal shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai area last winter was due to the freezing of Qinhuangdao, which prevented the southward transportation of Kailuan coal for several months. This year, preparations have been made in advance, and it is expected that a shortage will not occur again. As for household white coal for residents in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the Ministry's Fuel Management Committee is no longer controlling it. It is claimed that the main sources of fuel coal for the Nanjing-Shanghai area are currently the Kailuan, Taiwan, Huainan, and East China mines. Kailuan produces 450,000 tons per month, Taiwan 220,000 tons, Huainan 65,000 tons, and East China 45,000 tons. In terms of transportation, Kailuan coal is transported by the Beining Railway to Qinhuangdao and then by sea to Shanghai. Currently, there is no shortage of ships for maritime transport, but the Beining Railway is limited by the lack of railcars, and its transport capacity is only about 110,000 tons per month, which is insufficient. As for Taiwan coal, it is transported by ship to Shanghai, about 40,000 tons per month. Coal from the Huainan and East China mines is transported to Nanjing via the Jinpu Railway. The former averages about 40,000 tons per month, and the latter about 3,000 tons. If transportation can be improved, the amount of coal transported from each mine will certainly be more than the above figures. The coal demand in the Nanjing-Shanghai area is more than 150,000 tons per month for Shanghai and 50,000 tons per month for Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Coal Shortage in Changchun Becomes More Severe; Civilians Dig for Coal Slag</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 10th] The coal shortage in Changchun is severe, and parks have become coal mines. In Zhongshan Park, the most prominent park in the city center, the levee between the lakeside and the sports field, which is over ten zhang long, is currently being desperately dug up by hundreds of civilians to search for coal slag. This levee was formed by the dumping of coal slag over many years and is now covered with lush trees, with elm and locust tree trunks exceeding a foot in diameter. After the excavation, each pit is more than a zhang deep, and the roots of the trees are visible, their pale white contrasting with the black coal slag, creating a particularly poignant scene. When asked, the coal diggers said: "We were afraid of the cold last year, so we have to start thinking about it early this year." In reality, coal in the Northeast is more important than food for general livelihood during the six months from the winter months of October to March of the following year.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 11th] Amidst the coal shortage, local newspapers here reported the discovery of a coal seam at Dimingling on the Jichang Line, which is generally believed to be connected to the Yingcheng Mine. The relevant authorities may engage in mining after surveying the area.</p>
<h3>Tractors in the Northeast Gain the Favor of Farmers</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 11th] The Northeast Agricultural Tractor Management Office led reporters to Tiexi today to observe agricultural tractors. These powerful iron oxen have won the favor of farmers, who have gone from skepticism to trust. This is a testament to the achievements of the office's work in April. The office was established on May 1st and has 174 tractors. It has trained 40 drivers and technicians. However, due to the impact of the war north of Shenyang, the work is currently limited to the Shenyang area and has not yet been expanded. The Northeast has superior conditions for agricultural mechanization, and a quarter of the arable land requires 3,000 tractors.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Our Country's Basic Attitude Towards the Japanese Peace Conference</h3>
<p>According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 10th, American officials have expressed surprise at Premier Zhang's statement that "China will not attend a Japanese peace conference in which the Soviet Union does not participate." However, as of now, we have not seen the full text of Premier Zhang's speech or address in the newspapers, so it must be a misreport by the American press. However, these few words are related to our country's basic attitude towards the Japanese peace conference, and we cannot allow the United States to misunderstand, so we need to explain it.</p>
<p>The American misunderstanding of our country's basic attitude towards Japan may have been caused by Foreign Minister Wang's recent speech in Shanghai. Foreign Minister Wang frankly stated regarding the American proposal to convene a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty: "China has already made it clear that if the Soviet government refuses to participate in the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty proposed by the United States, then China will reconsider its position on this matter." He also said: "We cannot lightly abandon the cooperation of certain countries and propose to make peace with Japan alone. The purpose of our efforts should be to conclude a treaty that is beneficial to all Allied countries and supported by all Allied countries." This statement is extremely appropriate and accurate, with a positive meaning. Striving for the Soviet Union's participation in the Japanese peace conference has won unanimous praise from the Chinese and foreign press. Unexpectedly, the United States misunderstood, believing that China's position would be the same as the Soviet Union's because China wanted to strive for the Soviet Union's participation in the Japanese peace conference. Such a misunderstanding by American officials is not only unfortunate for Sino-American relations but also unfortunate for the entire Far East.</p>
<p>China's basic attitude towards Japan has been repeatedly stated by the government. Even recently, when Premier Zhang reported on domestic and foreign policy guidelines at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, he also pointed out China's basic attitude towards Japan in regards to the Japanese peace treaty issue: In short, although we do not adopt a retaliatory approach, we will never give up our right to demand due compensation from Japan. We are willing to see Japan's peaceful recovery, but we must prevent Japan from becoming a threat to peace in the Far East again. These few words have expressed China's basic attitude most thoroughly. Not only is it unanimously supported by the government and the public in our country, but it will also certainly be welcomed by all Allied countries. However, as of today, the issue of the Japanese peace treaty is no longer about differences in principles and ideals but about the inconsistencies in the interests of the Allied countries. Especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, because of the difference in interests, they cannot tolerate and trust each other, so they tend to extremes, creating the current stalemate of being unable to move forward or backward. Although the United States has tried every means in diplomacy to break the deadlock in the Japanese peace treaty, it has consistently failed to achieve results, so it has the intention of excluding the Soviet Union and making peace with Japan alone.</p>
<p>The suggestion of making peace with Japan alone was first proposed by former US President Hoover. At that time, the State Department stated that this was Hoover's personal opinion and not the view of the US government. However, the American media felt great interest and attached great importance to it, and they commented on it one after another. Everyone believed that Japan had surrendered for nearly two years, but the situation in the Far East had not yet stabilized, and a Japanese peace treaty should be concluded immediately so that the Far Eastern political situation could be brought into order as soon as possible. Therefore, they unanimously demanded that the Soviet Union reconsider its attitude. The so-called making peace with Japan alone was only a threat to the Soviet Union at that time, and no one expected that Hoover's proposal would have the possibility of being realized. But now, because of the changes in US-Soviet relations and the sharp turn for the worse in the situation in the Far East, the United States is considering excluding the Soviet Union and making peace with Japan alone.</p>
<p>How to clean up the mess in the Far East after the war? It is most closely related to the security of our country, and the resolution of the Japanese reparations issue is of particular importance to our country's interests. Therefore, from the day Japan surrendered, China has hoped to conclude a Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible so that the situation in the Far East can be stabilized as soon as possible. However, due to the international situation, it has been delayed until today, and not a single word of the Japanese peace treaty has been drafted, which has long made China impatient. Therefore, from this perspective, the United States and China share the same desire for the Japanese peace treaty to be concluded successfully as soon as possible. However, the wishes of the United States and China have not been realized. What is the crux of the matter? It is obviously the stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union that has caused the work of the Far Eastern Commission to be almost at a standstill and unable to move forward. The first to suffer from this stalemate is our China. On the one hand, being caught between the United States and the Soviet Union, we often feel the pain of being in a dilemma. Although our country has done its best to be a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, the facts have proven that it has not been able to achieve its wishes. On the other hand, we have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union's delaying policy, which has hindered the convening of the Japanese peace conference due to our own interests. At the same time, we cannot fully agree with the United States' Far Eastern policy.</p>
<p>First, the United States' current Far Eastern policy has not yet broken away from the approach of "Europe first, the Far East second." For Europe, under the Truman Doctrine, the United States has spared no expense in assisting countries such as Greece and Turkey to prevent the intrusion of foreign forces. However, for the Far East, it has not yet implemented its Truman Doctrine in the Far East. The crisis in the Far East is deepening day by day, which is enough to constitute a source of international turmoil, but the American diplomatic authorities are still turning a blind eye and letting it develop naturally. This policy is enough to cast a major mistake in American diplomacy.</p>
<p>Second, MacArthur's treatment of Japan is all about appeasement, even bordering on indulgence. The speed of Japan's recovery as a defeated country is almost unparalleled in modern history. Even today's Germany is far behind. Although the Japanese are doing their best to show their submissiveness on the surface, their ambition to engage in aggression again has not only never been abandoned but has also been rekindled. MacArthur trusts Japan too much, and the result is enough to cause another catastrophe in the Far East. It is nothing less than a major threat to China's peace and security. The early opening of Japan's foreign trade has made our country even more uneasy economically.</p>
<p>Third, some people in the United States are even advocating supporting Japan and want to make Japan the stabilizing force in the Far East in the future. This view is completely contrary to the US's view of China as a stabilizing force in the Far East during the war. Although it is currently only the opinion of the American people, the United States is a democratic country, and all domestic and foreign affairs are based on public opinion. This view may be adopted by the government in the future. Moreover, this view also contains other effects. We assume that the United States will forget the bloody lesson of Pearl Harbor in the future, recognize the enemy as a friend, and cooperate with Japan. Then, the great tragedy of the Far East will be staged immediately.</p>
<p>From the above, China cannot help but be suspicious of the United States' Far Eastern policy. Therefore, we must be very cautious about the future Japanese peace conference. Although our country's basic attitude towards Japan has always remained unchanged, we must strive for the Soviet Union's participation in the form of the peace conference. As Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao said: "Peace is indivisible. We hope to see collective security. I hereby warn any country not to hope or advocate making peace with Japan alone." At the same time, regarding the voting method to be adopted by the peace conference, in order to maintain its position in the peace conference, our country's public opinion unanimously advocates maintaining the veto power, because this power is really too important for China. China cannot be in a leading position like the United States, nor can it have many satellite countries like the United Kingdom, nor can it be as powerful as the Soviet Union. When encountering major issues of interest, if China cannot exercise its veto power, it will inevitably be sacrificed.</p>
<p>In short, our country has long decided on the basic attitude it should adopt towards the Japanese issue. It does not focus on its own gains and losses but focuses on the peace and stability of the entire Far East. Although we are eager for the Japanese peace conference to be convened as soon as possible, we are also unwilling to immediately conclude a peace treaty that is not conducive to peace in the Far East. Our efforts to secure Soviet participation in the peace conference do not mean that we will stand or fall with the Soviet Union but that we hope that the Japanese peace conference will take into account the interests of all Allied countries and that peace in the Far East will be established on a rational basis. That's all. Therefore, we hope that the American public and political circles can deeply reflect that, whether for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the sake of the United States' own interests, the current policy towards Japan really needs to be changed. In any case, the United States is not allowed to make major mistakes in diplomacy at this time.</p>

<h3>France's Peace Proposal to Vietnam Resolutely Rejected by Ho Chi Minh: No Ceasefire Without True Independence</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 11th] Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh broadcast to the Vietnamese people this morning, stating that the proposal broadcast by Vietnamese Governor Bollaert last night was completely disappointing and unacceptable. Ho called on the country to awaken from its current state of lull, to resume actively fighting the French immediately. Ho pointed out that Bollaert's proposal was so unsatisfactory that, if the war were to end tomorrow, the Vietnamese would ridicule allying with France in any way. Ho claimed that, except for the French, no one in the world was still trying to control the diplomatic affairs of other nations. Yet while the French proposed independence for them, they still did not allow them to comment on the country's foreign relations, which was not independence, but foolish, laughable, and despotic imperialism. They solemnly opposed it, and would continue to maintain a state of war with France, hoping that their young compatriots would enlist and go to war. The war has been going on for more than ten months, and the people's spirit has inevitably become slack, and must be reinvigorated immediately. Bollaert's latest proposal brought from Paris was no more than a bone without meat thrown to a dog.</p>
<p>The Wise Policies of Britain and America: Do Not Follow the Old Tricks of the Netherlands</p>
<p>What they demanded was complete independence within the French Union, an independence equal to that granted by Britain to India and Pakistan and that granted by the United States to the Philippines. The French, now powerless and beggars, still wanted to practice the lowest form of 19th-century imperialism, which they would never accept. Independence must be complete independence, or they would never accept it. The French should pay attention to the fact that peace negotiations in other parts of Asia have yielded perfect results. Now, they want to force them to accept peace by force. Look at Indonesia, where the Netherlands is already pleased with the development there. What their high commissioner is proposing is precisely a false copy of the old tricks of the Dutch, and the consequences will be equally bad. They will never stop fighting until they achieve their goal. If they continue to maintain their current position, they will sever all ties with the French Union, in which case French commercial interests in Vietnam will be cut off for many years. They will never stop fighting. The Viet Minh Liberation Army will continue to fight in the cities and battlefields until the last French invader is driven out of the Vietnamese coast. Ho finally called on the Viet Minh to nurture the influence of its call to war, saying, "The honor of our nation has been stained, and it is up to you to restore its purity. Quickly take up your sharp blades and fight! Strive to fight!"</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 11th] Vietnamese representatives who came to Hong Kong to attend the meeting convened by Annamese Prince Bao Dai expressed dissatisfaction with the broadcast speech of French High Commissioner in Vietnam Bollaert on the 10th, believing that the French authorities should not ignore the importance of Vietnamese independence and unity. These Vietnamese representatives held a symposium at their hotel on the morning of the 11th, but Bao Dai did not participate. According to the Vietnamese in the French-controlled areas of Vietnam, they hope that France can make peace with Bao Dai and restore the monarchy.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Talks on Korea Cannot Proceed: US Considers Unilateral Action; US Military Governor of South Korea, Lerch, Dies of Illness</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Responsible parties today stated that the United States is prepared to submit the Korean issue to the United Nations for handling as soon as possible in order to break the US-Soviet deadlock and promote the unification of Korea. Since the Soviet Union has rejected the State Department's proposal to hold a four-power conference, the United States has no choice but to make other preparations.</p>
<p>It is expected that the United Nations will appoint an investigation team to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and then submit a proposal requesting the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw their troops from the north and south of Korea respectively, and then hold national elections under the supervision of the United Nations to form a unified government. If the United Nations takes action as predicted, the Soviet Union is expected to oppose it. If so, the United States will take this as a signal to unilaterally implement its long-shelved plan to develop the economy of southern Korea. In addition, the State Department also plans to allow southern Korea to hold elections and form a fully elected parliament, which will then produce a provisional government with one president, one prime minister, and several ministers. This election will be held around December 1, and all adult men and women will be able to participate in the election in accordance with the new election law. After the US Congress reconvenes in January next year, it will first discuss the Marshall Plan for European aid, and then it hopes to be able to immediately discuss the plan for economic construction in southern Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall recently confirmed that the Soviet Union has rejected the US proposal to convene a four-power Korean conference, and said: The State Department is still studying the Soviet Union's reply before taking the next step. The next step the United States takes may be to discuss the Korean issue with other relevant countries, namely China and the United Kingdom. Marshall continued to confirm that the US delegation to the US-Soviet Joint Commission has sent a report to this place, saying that it is impossible to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the working principles of the Joint Commission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 11th] Lieutenant General Lerch, the US military governor of the US-occupied zone of South Korea, died here on the 11th at the age of 53. Military doctors said the cause of death was coronary venous congestion.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 11th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in South Korea, said on the 11th: "The sudden death of General Lerch is a great loss to me, to the United States, to Korea, and to the Korean people. The General worked too hard, which led to his inability to enjoy a long life and his death for the independence of Korea."</p>
<h3>Indo-Dutch Dispute: Security Council Urges Submission of Report</h3>
<p>Dutch Government to Issue Statement Regularly</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 11th] With the Security Council now in recess, the representatives have now shifted their attention to the Dutch-Indonesian issue. According to Soviet representative Gromyko, chairman of the Security Council in September, the Soviet Union insists that the consular investigation team should submit a report on the Java war immediately. If the Security Council does not receive a preliminary report within days, then I, as chairman, will have to pay attention to this and include it in the agenda.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 11th] The Dutch Lower House concluded its current session today, and the next session is scheduled to begin next Tuesday. The Speaker announced that the Dutch government will issue a statement on the Indonesian situation in parliament next Thursday.</p>

<h3>US Government to Convene Special Session of Congress to Discuss Interim Aid to Europe; Time to Be in October or November</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall said today that some European countries need US aid this year to cope with the urgent threat of hunger and cold. Such aid cannot be issued without convening a special session of the US Congress. This meeting may be convened in October or November.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Secretary of State Marshall announced today that he can prepare to submit a report of facts and figures on interim aid to Europe to the congressional subcommittee by the end of October. Marshall said that the State Department is currently giving urgent consideration to several forms of interim assistance to deal with the immediate threat of intolerable hunger and cold. As for the question of how to obtain the consent of Congress, it will have to wait for the developments in the next few weeks to decide.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] Marshall and other senior officials did not deny that Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Clayton had urgently telegraphed Washington from Europe last week, requesting that a special session of Congress be convened to vote on a 2.5 billion dollar relief plan. The greatest needs of Europe are food and fuel.</p>
<h3>Bevin Suddenly Suggests US Restore Lend-Lease</h3>
<p>British Political Circles Believe Bevin Misspeoke</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th] Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a speech to the American Legion today, explaining for the first time his recent suggestion that the United States redistribute the gold stored in Fort Knox, advocating that if the United States does not approve of the redistribution of gold, it should restore the wartime Lend-Lease Act to save the economic crisis in European countries. It is said that I don't care whether to use Lend-Lease or other methods. Even if Britain lacks US dollars, it will never lack determination.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 11th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin's suggestion that the United States should re-adopt the Lend-Lease Act to save Britain's economic collapse has made British political figures quite bewildered. According to well-informed sources in the British Foreign Office, this is another slip of the tongue by Bevin, just like the speech he gave in South Port last week, saying that the gold stored by the United States in Fort Knox should be drastically distributed.</p>
<h3>Five-Nation Peace Treaty Takes Effect on the 15th of This Month</h3>

Within ninety days from the date the treaty takes effect, all British and American troops stationed in Italy will be withdrawn from Italy. However, Britain, the United States and Yugoslavia will each retain 5,000 troops under the control of the Governor-General of the Free Territory of Trieste.</p>
<h3>Italian Political Situation Is Unstable: US State Department Is Paying Close Attention; Left-Wing Members of the Italian Socialist Party Ask the President to Resign</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th, United Press] US officials told reporters today that the Italian situation is Secretary of State Marshall's top priority. It is said that US Ambassador to Italy Dunn warned the government that the Italian situation is no longer a matter to be considered in months but a pressing matter to be decided in weeks. The Italian issue has now gone beyond the scope of political and economic discussion and has been presented to senior officials of the State Department for decision-making.</p>
<p>It is said that the government firmly believes in the following points: (1) The strike of farmers in Italy is manipulated by the Communist Party behind the scenes in an attempt to deepen the crisis; (2) If the United States deems it beneficial, it will not hesitate to use force; (3) Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Communist leader Togliatti assured Nenni that the winner in Italy will be Moscow, not Washington; (4) Another leader of the Socialist Party, Lombardo, who was originally considered a moderating force in Nenni's party, will split with Nenni and lead the socialist party members who do not approve of communism himself.</p>
<p>[Also] Left-wing Socialist Party leader Nenni today urged Italian Prime Minister Gasperi to either let his non-left-wing government step down or be overthrown by an irresistible force of opposition.</p>
<h3>Five Giants of the British Cabinet Decide Not to Change; The Position of the Labor Government Becomes More Stable</h3>

Well-informed sources also believe that the position of the Labor government has been the most stable in the past two months.</p>

<h3>Britain and South Korea Sign Agreement to Repatriate South Korean Refugees</h3>
<p>Black Elements Should Be Extradited to South Korea</p>
<p>[Reuters, Belgrade, 10th] Britain and South Korea have signed an agreement on the issue of repatriating South Korean refugees, stipulating that the head of the British Liaison Corps will set up a headquarters in Klagenfurt to jointly investigate the approximately 20,000 refugees in the British military zone in Austria with the South Korean Liaison Corps. It is reported that Tito has submitted the names of 1,000 people among the refugees who are suspected of being war criminals. Those whose names are on the list should first be reviewed by British judges in accordance with British law to determine whether the crimes they are accused of are legal. If they are determined to be legal, the British authorities will allow the South Korean authorities to extradite them. Britain and South Korea further agreed that the South Korean government may not request extradition again two months after the agreement is signed, and stipulated that the "black and gray elements" among the South Korean refugees in the British military zone should be handed over to South Korea, and the "white elements," that is, those who are not suspects of crimes wanted by the South Korean government, should be returned to South Korea in accordance with their own wishes.</p>

<h3>Stalled Progress in Convening Peace Conference Causes Deep Anxiety in Japanese Government and Public;  Mizukubo Writes to Bevin Urging Assistance</h3>
<p>[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The Katayama Cabinet takes great pride in being a "peace-making cabinet," meaning it can be responsible for concluding a peace treaty with Japan that is favorable to Japan. From the beginning of its formation, the Katayama Cabinet intended to cater to the wishes of the United States, hoping that the United States would make proposals favoring Japan in the peace conference. However, after the United States proposed convening a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty, the Soviet Union took the lead in suggesting discussions, and the opinions of the Commonwealth of Nations Canberra Conference were not entirely consistent with those of the United States. The Chinese government and people have paid close attention to the issue of the peace treaty with Japan and have broken away from their usual practices, not fully accepting the suggestions of the United States. The Japanese government and the public are quite anxious about such delicate international relations. Some national entities and private individuals are currently studying the question of "how to break open this deadlock in relations with Japan," intending to engage in behind-the-scenes activities through informal diplomacy. Mizukubo Ryokichi, the first Minister of Labor in the Katayama Cabinet, yesterday wrote to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, appealing for friendship and assistance in Japan's peaceful reconstruction, based on his personal relationship with Bevin, whom he had met once at the International Labor Association in Geneva in 1931. Mizukubo's action is the first instance of Japan exceeding the United Nations control over Japan's diplomatic activities since its defeat in the war. Its repercussions and developments are worthy of attention from the international community.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Egyptian Dispute Case Indefinitely Postponed; Our Proposal Rejected</h3>

<h3>Representatives from Eight Bureaus and One Office Bravely Venture into the Countryside Under Rain to Survey the Boundary Lines of Qibao and Dachang; Subsidy Amount After Demarcation Still Awaits Central Government Instructions; Villagers from Xinzhuang and Zhudi Petition to be Under Municipal Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The issue of boundary demarcation between this city and Jiangsu Province has been unresolved for nearly twenty years. Disputes have arisen repeatedly. In November of last year, the Ministry of Interior specially dispatched Inspector Cheng Jing to Shanghai to jointly survey the area with representatives from the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Municipal Government. In March of this year, the Ministry of Interior convened representatives from all parties concerned in Beijing to discuss the matter. It was not until recently that the Municipal Government received the Executive Yuan's approval of various regulations regarding the division of jurisdiction between this city and Jiangsu Province (see this newspaper on the 6th for details).</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Municipal Government, in addition to notifying the relevant county governments in Jiangsu Province to schedule handovers and dispatch personnel to negotiate handover procedures, yesterday also sent representatives from the eight bureaus of land administration, police, education, social affairs, health, finance, public works, and public utilities, as well as representatives from the civil affairs office, braving the rain to Qibao and Dachang districts to survey the boundary lines and investigate the distribution of agencies, schools, and organizations. This reporter accompanied them, departing at 10:00 AM and returning at 6:30 PM. Representatives from various bureaus are sorting out the information gathered to serve as a reference for improving governance and construction after the official takeover.</p>
<h3>The Entire Picture of Qibao Town</h3>
<p>Qibao is located between Songjiang, Qingpu, and Shanghai, covering three li east to west and ten li north to south, with a total of 4,188 households and 17,646 residents. The streets are narrow, less than a zhang wide. There are two municipal primary schools, Qishi and Mingqiang, and a private Zhaojian Primary School run by the Catholic Church. Recently, the Municipal Education Bureau established a municipal agricultural vocational school in the area, and school buildings are under construction. The prestigious private Nanyang Model Middle School has also acquired a site in Qibao and will move there once the school buildings are completed. The entire area severely lacks sanitation and medical facilities, and flies swarm. There are very few community organizations, with only one charity organization called the San Shan Tang. The hall owns more than 260 mu of land and recently donated 100 mu for the establishment of a municipal agricultural vocational school. Local residents are responsible for guarding, with more than 120 members of the militia and volunteer patrols. They also maintain contact with the 152nd Brigade stationed nearby.</p>
<p>Xinzhuang Residents Petition</p>
<p>When the survey team arrived in the autumn rain and mud, the streets were covered with red-bordered slogans from the people of Xinzhuang, opposing the inclusion of Xinzhuang into Shanghai County. After a trip to the South Temple for rest, more than 200 villagers from Xinzhuang, holding paper flags and shouting slogans, demanded respect for public opinion and the inclusion of Xinzhuang into Shanghai City. Li Yusheng, the district head of Longhua, introduced five representatives from Xinzhuang to Wu Zunyi, a specialist from the Land Administration Bureau, presenting a petition stating that Xinzhuang has a total of 6,861 residents, and its military service, education, baojia, and tax matters are currently managed by the Municipal Government. There are six primary schools, Zhangyi, Xinzhuang, Chunshen, Xinnongcun, Banqiao, and Central School, with a total of more than 1,800 students, and their educational expenses have long been allocated by the Municipal Government. The petition concluded by stating the disadvantages of including Xinzhuang into Shanghai County. Specialist Wu addressed all the petitioning villagers, expressing great sympathy for their cause and promising to convey their requests to the government for consideration and decision by the central government. The district representatives then raised several questions regarding the boundary demarcation regulations approved by the Executive Yuan, and Specialist Wu also promised to forward them to the central government for clarification.</p>
<p>Subsidy Issues</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the team continued to Dachang, which is sixteen li north to south and twelve li east to west, with a population of about 40,000. There is an airfield and barracks in the district, making it a military zone. There are five private primary schools, sixteen municipal primary schools, one Xingci Middle School, and a Dachang branch of the People's Education Hall. Currently, in addition to land registration, finance and education are under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government. A health office has not yet been established, and medical facilities are lacking. Last year, the Baoshan County Government attempted to collect land taxes from the residents of the Dachang district, but the residents refused. Currently, the northern part of Dachang is bounded by the Yunzao Creek with Baoshan County. The Executive Yuan's regulations restore the pre-war boundary, extending the boundary line to Huangnitang, several li north of the Yunzao Creek. Therefore, the Dachang district needs to prepare to receive this land several li beyond the Yunzao Creek. According to the Executive Yuan's regulations, a small piece of land in the northwest corner of Dachang needs to be incorporated into Jiading County. Comparatively, the land being incorporated is larger than the land being ceded. The problem lies in how to subsidize the Baoshan County Government after the boundary demarcation, which may cause disputes in the future. The subsidy amount determined before the war was said to be around 16,000 yuan. What multiple of this amount should be used to calculate the subsidy still needs to be requested from the central government for negotiation and decision.</p>
<h3>Worlds Apart</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter accompanied the Municipal Government survey team between Qibao and Dachang, which are far apart north to south, passing through the bustling Nanjing Road with its tall buildings. Compared to Qishi, whose streets are less than a zhang wide and difficult to navigate due to mud, although both are districts under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City, the lifestyles and enjoyment of their residents are worlds apart. This reporter once asked the residents of Xinzhuang why they were so determined to oppose being incorporated into Shanghai County.

<h3>"Renting" a Wife and Regretting the Agreement; Lawsuit Filed to Enforce</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mao Yupin and a young woman named Ding Xiuling entered into a "rental" agreement in 1944. The content was quite peculiar, roughly stating that the man had a wife and the woman had a husband, but from the date of the agreement, both parties voluntarily cohabited. The man would provide the woman with 10 jin of grain for pocket money and 75 jin of grain for living expenses per month, both calculated and paid in cash at the market price. The woman was allowed to live in her original place, and the man was free to come and go, and no one was allowed to interfere. If the woman gave birth to children, they would be raised by the man. It was stated that the term was ten years, and this was written as proof. However, after the two cohabited for six months, the man stopped going and stopped paying the price of 85 jin of grain. Ms. Ding then filed a complaint with the Civil Division of the District Court, requesting that the defendant Mao Yupin be ordered to perform the contract. The case was heard yesterday in the Civil Division Seven by Judge Lu Pinru, and both the plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court. Mao initially denied the agreement, but after being shown the contract in court, he lowered his head and admitted it, stating that he felt very uncomfortable every time he saw her husband, so he stopped going after six months. Ding Xiuling gave birth to a daughter in September 1944 and received a letter from Ding asking him to settle the procedures, but he did not reply because it was not his responsibility. Ding Xiuling stated that the defendant broke the contract and that the girl was indeed born as a result of the relationship with the defendant, and the defendant should be held responsible. The court ordered the two parties to go outside and reconcile, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>

<h3>Laid-Off Workers from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Invite the Press and Call for Action</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Due to austerity measures, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to lay off more than 400 of the 600 workers in its first, second, and third repair shops, retaining only one-third. The workers once petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, which decided that a nine-person team, composed of representatives from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the laid-off workers, the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, and the Shipowners Association, would be formed to handle the matter. The team went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for on-site investigation the day before yesterday. According to Shen Yixin, the director of the company's business department, the past monthly expenses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, including labor costs, required 2 billion yuan, but the income in August this year was only 800 million yuan, which could not be sustained. Therefore, it was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to economize and retrench. Currently, about 400 of the 600 workers are machine workers, and even if the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company builds ships, it does not need so many machine workers proportionally. Yesterday, the repair workers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company posted slogans on streetcars to arouse the attention of the public.

<h3>Theater Industry Laments Hardship, Requests Extension of Business Hours</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zhou Jianxing, the chairman of the Shanghai Theater Industry Association, requested the Municipal Council to forward a letter to the central government requesting an extension of business hours, as the government is implementing austerity measures and plans to shorten business hours. He listed several reasons, roughly stating: (1) After shortening business hours, a large number of actors and staff will inevitably be laid off, which will cause unemployment problems. (2) The theater industry has always made great efforts for the public good of the country and society, whether it is for comfort or fundraising, and it bears a large amount of taxes and levies. Therefore, it is hoped that it will not be included in the general entertainment venues in the austerity program. (3) The focus of the current austerity is on the economy, and foreign exchange is extremely important. The theater is operated by Chinese people, performed by Chinese people, and watched by Chinese people. What is gained from Chinese people is still used by Chinese people, and the rights and interests are not leaked out. (4) Business has been sluggish for many years, and the off-season months are even more depressed. In normal business, there are often incidents involving soldiers and police, resulting in unbearable losses. The only hope is in the autumn season, but once the time is shortened, audiences will arrive at the venue after dinner, and the play will be over, and it will be difficult to arrange famous actors and famous plays.</p>

<h3>Huang Bohui's Sniping Case: Public Trial Held for the First Time Yesterday; Huang Said That Zheng Desheng Was Originally a Close Friend; Hatred Arose Because of the Recovery of the Landlord Rights</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Desheng, who is suspected of instigating the shooting of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shibao, in February of this year, was prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for attempted murder. The first trial was held in the District Court yesterday. The victim Huang Bohui personally went to court to describe the experience of being injured, saying that he and Zheng were originally friends. He had entrusted Zheng to rent out all the properties of the Shibao Building in the past and collect the rent on his behalf. Later, Zheng used the rent for his own purposes, so he notified the tenants to pay the rent directly to him, and thus formed a hatred with Zheng. Zheng has two American friends, one named Ghas Welltop and the other named Mark Xiu, who are the first and second officers on the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Wanshin ship. When he returned home at around 10:00 PM on February 18th, he was suddenly rushed out by two Americans between the third and fourth floors of the Shibao Building. One held his left arm, and the other stared at him and said, "This is the person we need." The other American heard this and shot at him. He lowered his body, feeling something pass over his head. Fearing that he would shoot again, he said in English, "I am a friend of President Roosevelt." The two Americans then left him. He has no grudges with foreigners, and this act was obviously instigated by Zheng." Then, the witness Wu Kechang, a worker at the Shibao Building, gave testimony: "When I went home on the night of February 18th, just as I was about to enter the door, I saw two foreigners coming out, and at the same time, I saw Zheng Desheng's daughter standing next to the escalator, seemingly seeing them off." The court then questioned the defendant Zheng Desheng, who flatly denied the conspiracy to assassinate. Because further investigation is needed, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3>Economy Helps Education, Kindness Extends Years; Nianci Jun Benefits the Poor; Donates 5 Million from Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Yesterday we received a letter from our reader "Nianci Jun" and a donation of 5 million yuan. In his letter, he said:</p>
<p>"The 7th of this month was my 50th birthday. I received congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends, including 15 million yuan in cash. I have decided to divide the money into three shares and donate it to Shanghai charitable organizations to help suffering compatriots, to benefit all my relatives and friends. Among them, 5 million yuan will be donated to the Anti-Tuberculosis Association and 5 million yuan will be donated to the flood victims in Guangdong and Guangxi. Another 5 million yuan will be donated to your newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund" to help poor students. I was unable to attend school as a child and deeply feel the lack of knowledge, which I regret. Although the amount is small and does not solve the problem, it is also intended to be a humble offering."</p>
<p>The letter from "Nianci Jun" reveals sincere enthusiasm in every line. He was unable to attend school as a child and currently feels the pain of lacking knowledge. He does not want to see countless poor students suffer the misfortune of not being able to attend school again. Congratulating a birthday is "icing on the cake," while helping education is "sending charcoal in the snow." Now Nianci Jun combines the two into one, which can be said to be rare and beautiful.</p>
<p>Since the special fundraising began, "Nianci Jun" has broken all previous records in individual donations. We hope that people in society will follow suit, so as to achieve the perfect state of "economy helping education."</p>
<p>"Nianci Jun" does not want to reveal his real name and refuses our planned praise for him, and repeatedly instructed that photos not be published. "Nianci" is his alias, because he is purely filial to his mother, and uses it to commemorate his late mother.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yong'an Advertising Company raised nearly 4 million yuan in donations for us. We would like to express our gratitude to the gentlemen of the company for their enthusiasm in helping education. (Donation report published in the Social Service column)</p>

<h3>Misappropriation of Troop慰勞 Donations: Chairman of Yangjing District People's Assembly Suspected</h3>
<p>Cheng Jiaju, a resident of Yangjing District, yesterday filed a petition with the Municipal Council alleging that Zhang Ruoxu, chairman of the District People's Representative Assembly, was suspected of illegally misappropriating "ten thousand yuan of troop慰勞 donations" and requested a thorough investigation. The original petition stated: "Yangjing District was allocated 400 million yuan for troop慰勞 donations, and the people enthusiastically donated. I learned from a conversation with the staff of the No. 8 Office of the Shanghai Municipal Bank that the amount paid by each 保 to the special account for troop慰勞 in Yangjing (32058) has exceeded 100 million yuan, but for some reason, Yangjing District has not transferred it to the General Assembly. According to Director Li, on September 6th, Zhang Ruoxu, chairman of the District People's Representative Assembly, came to the bank to negotiate the use of 50 million yuan from the troop慰勞 donations because Yuchangtai South Goods Store, which he operated, needed to pay the sixth installment of the household sugar payment, and his funds were not circulating smoothly. The bank could not refuse because his check procedures were complete, so it cashed 50 million yuan."</p>

<h3>Recommendations to Rescue the Industrial Crisis: Central Government Responds with Four Points</h3>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Council's proposal to the central government to rescue the industrial crisis, after the Executive Yuan forwarded it to the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs and the Four Joint Offices Import Temporary Management Committee for review, four measures have now been decided and replied to the Municipal Government yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the need to continue and strictly supervise the management of large production loans, according to the response from the Four Joint Offices and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, although commercial credit loans are currently being controlled, assistance is still being provided to daily necessities and production enterprises, and a roving inspection team is organized to specifically audit and eliminate malpractices. (2) Regarding the relaxation of foreign exchange amounts and allocation methods for imported raw materials, and that emphasis should be placed on national industrial sectors and direct production agencies, according to the response from the Import Management Committee, the quota for rubber was originally set at US$1.1 million for the first quarter and increased by US$900,000 in the second quarter, totaling US$2 million. The feeling that it is still insufficient is indeed a fact, and attention will be paid to it at that time. Regarding the direct allocation of industrial raw materials to production agencies, such as the direct allocation of cotton to various yarn factories, it has already been handled. The direct allocation of raw rubber to various production agencies is still pending due to the inability to adjust the machinery and equipment directly. Regarding the original proposal to prioritize the allocation to national industries and direct production, it has been found that imported raw materials are allocated to various importers based on the quota approved by the government, whether they are distributors or manufacturers, and are limited to merchants who have previously imported the goods before or after the war and have actual contact with foreign countries. If it is allocated to manufacturers who have not previously imported, it does not comply with government regulations. (3) Regarding assisting and handling the procurement, unified planning, and unified allocation of production raw materials, according to the response from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, matters such as the procurement and distribution of industrial and mining raw materials in various places should be handled by the respective industries in consultation with the Ministry's industrial and commercial guidance offices in various places. (4) Regarding restricting the periodic increase of taxes to support the development of industry, according to the response from the Ministry of Finance, the current taxes, except for the export tax, which has been abolished, the import tax still uses the tariff rates of the Import Tariff Regulations of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], and is levied on foreign goods. The income and profit taxes are levied on the income and profits of foreign businesses, and there is no provision for periodic increases.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Domestically Produced Bicycle Manufacturers Go to Beijing to Petition, Expressing Satisfaction: Government Guarantees No Import of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 11th] Representatives from Shanghai domestically produced bicycle factories, led by Xia Zhichao, a group of seven people, after arriving in Beijing on the 9th, went to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and other relevant agencies to petition, explaining that the bicycle manufacturing industry in Shanghai alone has reached 300 companies, directly and indirectly supporting more than 100,000 people, producing more than 200,000 bicycles annually, coupled with products from various places, fully meeting the needs of the country, and that there is no need to import Japanese goods of the same level. Now, reading the implementation outline proposed by the Committee for Directing Trade with Japan, it is surprising that transportation equipment is included in the imported goods. At the same time, 2,000 bicycles obtained from the Sino-Trust Bureau's barter trade have also appeared on the market, and they sincerely hope that the government will reconsider this matter and that the Sino-Trust Bureau can actively strive not to import Japanese bicycles again. The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that there are no regulations allowing the import of bicycles in the implementation outline, and guaranteed that this will not happen in the future, and that the military vehicles imported by the Sino-Trust Bureau will not appear on the market and compete for profits with the people, and that there will be no more imports in the future. The Executive Yuan expressed its attention to the matter and guaranteed that it would never allow Japanese bicycles to enter the country, hoping that they would produce with peace of mind. The representatives were very satisfied with the successful results.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Hong Kong: Deposed King Bao Dai: In Hong Kong, Heart in Vietnam. Miss Hong Kong's Lawsuit Against Husband: Accepted.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hong Kong, 8th] Deposed Vietnamese King Bao Dai has been living in Hong Kong as a recluse for more than a year. Recently, due to the drastic changes in the Vietnamese political situation, Bao Dai's activities have changed from secret to public. Bao Dai's wife, the "Southern Queen," flew from Saigon to Hong Kong a few days ago, and Bao Dai personally went to the airport to welcome her, revealing Bao Dai's true face for the first time in Hong Kong. Bao Dai lives in the scenic Repulse Bay Road, and now he has received his family, and seems to have no intention of returning to Vietnam for the time being. His spokesman, Liu Dezong, has recently been sending news to reporters frequently, and the news about Bao Dai's return to Vietnam is sometimes tight and sometimes loose. Bao Dai telegraphed representatives of various Vietnamese parties on the 4th of this month, inviting them to Hong Kong to discuss national affairs together, and it was scheduled to be held on the 9th. Although Bao Dai has come to this scenic Hong Kong, he has not been able to forget his homeland.</p>

Wu Danfeng saw reporters at Lai Chi Garden and also made her usual statement. She said that regardless of any losses, she would resolve the divorce issue. She said, "She is an oppressed woman, why does the majority of public opinion not sympathize with her?"</p>
<p>Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Election: Calm as a Well</p>
<p>After the news of our government's regular general election was announced, Chinese and English newspapers in Hong Kong have repeatedly criticized it, especially expressing aversion to the point that our overseas Chinese maintain "dual nationality." A Hong Kong government spokesman also said that our overseas Chinese holding elections in Hong Kong violates international law, but if China and the UK establish a special agreement in advance, such elections can proceed. It was also said that if elections are held by proxy without the need for public election gatherings in Hong Kong, it is not illegal. A spokesman for the External Affairs Office of the Two Guangxi Special Envoy in Hong Kong declined to comment on this issue, but admitted that he had made representations to the British side. Therefore, until now, the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese have remained as calm as a well regarding the general election campaign.</p>
<p>Thousands of Machinists: Relaxed and Composed</p>
<p>The general strike launched by the Hong Kong Chinese Machinists' Association is about to last a month, and there is still no news of a resolution. The workers are "relaxed and composed," and launched a trip to Shatin, a suburb of Kowloon, on the 7th. More than 1,000 machinists participated, and the police authorities dispatched additional police and medical teams to "protect" them. A newspaper called it the "world's unparalleled traveling team." A film company specially sent a photographer to put this uncommon procession of workers on the screen, but the employers are not as "comfortable" as the workers. They had agreed to increase wages from 20% to 45% a few days ago, but the workers still insisted on the demand of 100%. People from all walks of life hope that both labor and management will continue to make concessions and resolve the serious atmosphere as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Repair Project of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Completed Two-Thirds; Another Yunnan-Guizhou Railway Survey Team Formed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Kunming, 11th] The railway tracks of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from Bisezhai to Hekou were severely damaged during the Anti-Japanese War, and due to years of disrepair, the road surface was also heavily damaged. After the victory, the Ministry of Transportation ordered the formation of a rapid repair team to actively repair the railway to enable the full line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to be opened. After more than a year of work, no results were achieved. By August of this year, two-thirds of the entire project had been completed, and another Yunnan-Guizhou Railway survey team was formed, which departed from Kunming, with the goal of meeting the surveyors departing from Hechi within three months. The starting point of the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway is Kunming, passing through Dingliang, Xingyi, and Hechi, and connecting with the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, directly to the border of Guizhou. However, because the instruments used by the survey team are too old, it is feared that it will be difficult to complete the work within the predetermined three-month period. In order to make the railway tracks suitable for carriages nationwide, it was decided to adopt the standard gauge of 1.435 meters.</p>

<h3>Changzhou Water Monster Scare: A Night of Fright, A Case of Unnecessary Worry</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch, 10th] For the past few days in Changzhou, along the riverbanks where boat dwellers and water residents live, shadowy figures have been seen, arousing suspicion of ghosts and "water monsters" or fears of "flower-snatching gangs." Rumors spread wildly, causing widespread panic. Several frights occurred each night, stirring up a great commotion throughout the city. Upon closer investigation, most of these incidents were based on imagined appearances and baseless fears, often stemming from sheer nervousness and unnecessary worry. However, there may also be malicious individuals deliberately creating confusion to disrupt public order, which should not be overlooked. In the water monster case, several individuals were apprehended in our county, but after interrogation, it was found that they were all victims of misunderstanding and undeserved beatings, turning the situation into a laughingstock. For instance, Chen Chunfa, a farmer from Beitang Township, recently hired a small boat on the 7th to come to Changzhou to purchase timber from the Yuansheng Lumber Company outside the East Gate, intending to take it back to repair his dilapidated house. The boat was anchored by the East Gate archway that night. In the quiet moonlight, he was fishing for amusement on the dock beside the boat. At the same time, a fishing boat on the opposite bank was obscured in the dim light, its shadowy movements leading people to suspect the presence of a water monster. Someone shouted loudly about the monster, and dozens of boat dwellers and nearby residents along the river, hearing the cry, armed themselves with bamboo poles, short sticks, and kitchen knives, surrounding the dock. They seized Chen Chunfa and beat him, causing injuries all over his body. The Self-Defense Force arrived to maintain order and took Chen Chunfa to be questioned. He explained the situation, and it became clear that it was a misunderstanding, leading to a disorderly dispersal. Similar incidents have occurred in Benniu and Lucheng. The police and military authorities have taken note of the situation, and it is expected to be resolved soon.</p>

They detained and assaulted villagers Wu Awu, Jin Zhongshan, and Xuan Linde, who were also soldiers of the Alert Reserve Squad. The case caused a sensation throughout the city and has been reported in this newspaper several times. It is now learned that the soldiers involved, Liu Kai and Bao Huashu, as well as Company Commander Chen Xixi, were arrested by the Tenth District Commissioner's Office. A summary military court was formed to conduct a joint trial, which has now concluded. Liu Kai and Bao Huashu were sentenced based on Article 15 and Article 85 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law, Article 28 and Article 74, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, the preceding paragraph of Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and Article 1, Article 6, and Article 8 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Trial Law. The main text of the judgment states that Liu Kai and Bao Huashu are jointly convicted of stealing property and are each sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. Company Commander Chen Xixi has been transferred to Nanjing for trial. Furthermore, the Combined Service Headquarters has allocated one million legal tender to the injured villager Wu Awu for medical expenses, and 500,000 legal tender each to Jin Zhongshan and Xuan Linde for medical expenses.

<h3>Mass Education Conference Costs Exceed 900 Million</h3>

Journalists from Beijing and Shanghai covering the conference have jointly requested to accompany the group. The Chinese delegation passed this request on the morning of the 11th, stipulating that each newspaper should bear its own travel expenses and be limited to five people, as the conference expenses are extremely tight.

The Ministry of Education is currently busy negotiating with local governments to request assistance in hosting the group and resolving the current difficulties.

<h3>Mayor Wu Receives Reporters, Announces Measures to Suppress and Stabilize Rice Prices; Commander Xuan Orders Strict Prohibition of Rice Smuggling Exports</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice price in the city has recently risen sharply, and Mayor Wu is very anxious about this and is looking for ways to suppress and stabilize it. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, he received reporters in the City Government conference room to report on the reasons for the rising rice prices and to announce the city government's new measures to suppress and stabilize rice prices, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Unblocking Sources: Rice-producing areas have been affected by the war, leading to a decrease in sources. It is also reported that rice-producing areas in southern Anhui and other places have regulations prohibiting the export of rice. Mayor Wu contacted Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan by telephone yesterday afternoon. Premier Zhang stated that in addition to ordering various places to lift the bans, the Executive Yuan is actively handling measures to unblock the sources of rice in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Strict Prohibition of Smuggling: The rise in rice prices is closely related to smuggling. According to reports obtained by the City Government, large-scale smuggling has been discovered in rice-producing areas such as Wuhu. The targets of smuggling are Japan and the bandit areas. The Ministry of Food has now ordered that rice produced in Wuhu can only be transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Increase Allotment: Starting this month, it has been decided to increase the allocation of rice by 70,000 dan, specifically for workers and the poor. The original monthly rice allocation in the city was 180,000 dan, which has now been increased to 250,000 dan, which is believed to be sufficient for distribution. The City Government has reached an agreement with the Central Trust Bureau, and additional allocation can be made internally.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu stated: In two weeks, the new grain will be on the market, and the rice problem will tend to improve.</p>
<p>Another report: Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, in response to the fluctuating rice prices in the city in recent days and reports of unscrupulous elements smuggling rice for export, which is illegal, issued an order on the 11th prohibiting the export of food and confiscating all shipments without proof of documents from the competent authority. This order has been instructed to the Maritime Inspection Brigade for strict implementation.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Rice Market</h3>
<p>Another report: The police局 received an order from Mayor Wu yesterday to investigate the rice markets in the north and south of the city to determine whether there were any illegal activities to raise rice prices. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the Pu Rice Market: (1) Due to rumors that rice from Hunan was being blocked and that transportation in northern Anhui was obstructed, sources suddenly became scarce, and prices in various producing areas were reported to be rising. Meanwhile, retail sales in the city were active, and purchases were not weak, so rice prices generally tended to be high.</p>
<p>(2) The city's old rice supply is gradually shrinking, while demand has not decreased, and people are expecting higher prices.</p>
<p>(3) During the inspection of entry permits, it was discovered that Chen Shiqin of Chen Hengtai Rice Store No. 5 in Caohejing Town used the temporary entry permit of Yuxingsheng Rice Shop No. 2 on Nanchang Road to enter the market, and Zhong Chunyang, an employee of Tongfengyi Rice Shop on Malong Road, entered the market without a permit. After presenting their ID cards and obtaining certification from the Nanshi Rice Industry Market, they were not taken to the局.</p>
<p>(4) The Nanshi Rice Market issues unlimited temporary entry permits to member stores, and the validity period is one month. To prevent illegal elements or non-industry people from taking the opportunity to sneak in and raise prices, the person in charge of the market should be instructed to regulate the number of temporary entry permits and shorten the validity period to one day.</p>
<p>Regarding the North Rice Market, police局 personnel arrived at the site at 11:25 AM, but the market had already closed. (The business hours there are from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM). According to Xu Songren, the director of the market, the reason for the rising rice prices is the high prices in the producing areas and the fact that it is the lean season. The severity of the situation will be difficult to eliminate in the short term.</p>
<p>The police局, acting on Mayor Wu's order, has sent personnel to strictly investigate the smuggling of rice for export.</p>
<h3>Unified Purchase of National Cotton Temporarily Difficult to Achieve; Strict Implementation of Cloth Management; Free Sale of Private Yarn Mills to Be Abolished</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the "Implementation Plan for Coordinating Yarn and Cloth Supply and Demand for the Development of the Textile Industry," which was previously discussed by the Textile Adjustment Committee and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review, the National Economic Commission believes that the plan would not allow the government to effectively control materials and insisted on modifying it to uniformly purchase and sell cotton and cloth. The Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Yunwu, was appointed to preside over the formation of another review subcommittee. The subcommittee held a meeting in Beijing on the 9th. President Zhang of the National Bank, Finance Minister Yu Hongjun, Economics Minister Chen Qitian, Agriculture Minister Zuo Shunsheng, and members of the National Economic Commission, among others, attended. The six regional cotton spinning guilds sent Tang Xinghai, Rong Erren, Liu Piji, and Wu Weijing to automatically provide opinions. The subcommittee also summoned Gao Bingtai, director of the Textile Adjustment Committee's Business Office, and Liu Wenteng, chief engineer of the Textile Construction Company, to attend and provide information. It is learned that the subcommittee, after two days of review meetings on the 9th and 10th, believes that the unified purchase of cotton should take into account the opinions of all parties, because for the unified purchase of national cotton: (1) The cotton purchase funds, calculated at 6 million dan, would require 12 trillion yuan, and the revolving funds would require at least 6 trillion yuan. If the government issued such a large amount of funds, it would likely cause further inflation. (2) Private yarn mills would have no cotton to purchase, and their funds would inevitably cause trouble in the market, easily affecting sharp price increases. (3) The government lacks a large number of technical personnel for the unified purchase of national cotton. (4) The required cotton quality varies from factory to factory, and the number of spindles also varies. Given the current difficult transportation situation, distribution problems would be difficult to solve easily. (5) The yarn counts and quality of spindles vary from factory to factory, and the amount of national cotton required for manufacturing also varies. If the government does not have a large number of specialized personnel to manage it, it will reduce quality, sharply reduce production efficiency, and easily waste raw materials. (6) Unified purchase and sale requires a large number of specialized personnel. During the War of Resistance, there were only 168,000 spindles in the rear, and even then, more than 2,000 management personnel were needed, but even then, the ideal could not be achieved. Now, there are more than 4 million spindles nationwide, and more management personnel would be needed. Looking around the country, it is impossible to recruit them. The National Economic Commission believes that the above problems are difficult to solve at present. Therefore, it was decided to shelve the unified purchase of national cotton. However, in order to effectively control cloth, facilitate the supply and demand of training agents, and thereby stabilize market prices, it was decided to completely and thoroughly conduct joint distribution of finished yarn and cloth from national and private yarn mills. The free sale of parts of private yarn mills in the past will be cancelled. It is reported that the plan will be submitted to the National Economic Commission for review and approval, and then it will be announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee and implemented.</p>
<h3>Rice Reaches New High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 5,800 shih of grain arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market trend was influenced by rising prices in the interior, slow transportation from Anhui Province, slow arrivals from the Yangtze River, and high prices. Shops and merchants had no goods, just as the autumn harvest was not yet connected. Indica rice rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and early thin rice continued to increase by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, reaching new highs again. Xian rice also increased by more than 10,000 yuan, and white round new rice increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. New rice from Wuxi, Kunshan, and West Road has appeared on the market.</p>

Factory flour and miscellaneous brand flour are 12,000 yuan per four small bags, and the situation has softened. Unified flour is flat, and bran is rising sharply, increasing by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan alone.</p>
<p>The oil market has mixed fluctuations. The consumption of raw oil is still sluggish, and the market is flat. Sesame oil has little change, and clear oil has rarely changed. Vegetable oil has very slight fluctuations, and soybean oil is exceptionally popular, continuing to rise sharply by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Transshipment of Grains, Rice, and Wheat from Provinces and Cities along the Yangtze River Must Be Approved by the Ministry of Food</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs posted Proclamation No. 154 yesterday, stating briefly: The General Inspector of Customs has received a telegram from the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance stating that the Ministry of Food stipulates that if grains, rice, and wheat from provinces and cities along the Yangtze River are transported out of the mouth of the Yangtze River and transferred to other coastal provinces for sale, they must be approved by the Ministry of Food. The export of flour should be handled in accordance with the flour quota transfer method. Furthermore, grain merchants transporting grain from the coastal provinces outside the mouth of the Yangtze River must first apply to the Ministry of Food for approval. In addition to the Ministry of Food replying for notification and telexing the customs (or tax authorities) of the place of origin and Jianghai Customs for verification and release, the customs (or tax authorities) of each place of origin shall, based on the Ministry of Food's telegram and the Ministry's approval held by the grain merchant, approve the declaration and shipment. Jianghai Customs is responsible for instructing the Wusongkou checkpoint to conduct inspections. Those who have not been approved by the Ministry of Food will be treated as smuggling. The order has been issued for compliance, and commercial grain transported through Wusongkou will be strictly inspected to prevent smuggling.</p>

<h3>Many "Spot" Shares Sold Off in Panic; All Chinese Stocks Experience Broad Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks faced the "roll-over" (期掉) day, and there was no stimulating factor. Holders of "spot" shares, particularly those in "Yong Sha" (永紗) that were due for immediate delivery, engaged in frantic selling. This made the effect of the rise of 500 yuan in the US dollar market price very short-lived. After the initial surge, prices steadily declined. The shares listed on the American and Asian Exchange suffered even greater losses. Even small stocks like "Xin Guang" (新光) and "Jing Fu" (景福) appeared bleak. The trading day closed with these shares hitting new lows.</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, "Yong Sha" shares for immediate delivery opened low, at 230 yuan, causing all cotton yarn stocks to show weakness. "Yong Sha" for forward delivery fell to a low of 240 yuan. When the US dollar market price surged to a high of 500 yuan, market sentiment briefly improved. "Yong Sha" for immediate delivery rose to 242 yuan and for forward delivery to 248 yuan. However, when the prices rose, some investors sold off their holdings, causing the price of "Yong Sha" for immediate delivery to fall back to 239 yuan. In the off-exchange (場外) market, interest rates (息價) opened at 1.65% and 2.1%, with some opening at 1.8% and 2.25%. The situation shifted uncertain. In any case, yarn prices declined by a small amount of 200,000. Unable to hold. Near noon, prices fell to lows of 232 yuan and 238 yuan before closing at 233 yuan and 238 yuan. After the close, quoted prices stabilized slightly, and in the afternoon, off-exchange quoted prices rose to 239 yuan.</p>
<p>Ultimately, compared to the previous close, "Yong Sha," "Xin He," (信和) and "Qin Xing" (勤興) stocks for immediate delivery fell slightly. "Xin Hua" (新華) remained unchanged. "Zhong Fa" (中法) rose slightly. "Mei Ya" (美亞), "Hua Feng" (華豐), "Xin Guang" (新光), "Yong Gong" (永公), and "Jing Fu" (景福) each fell by 5%. "Shang Wu" (商務) "Li An" (麗安), and "Shang Ping" (尚平) were unchanged. "Zhong Si" (中絲) and "Xin Ya" (新亞) fell by less than 5%, while the rest experienced slight declines. For forward delivery, "Yong Sha" rose slightly. "Xin Guang" (新光), "Jing Fu" (景福), "Mei Ya" (美亞), "Xin He" (信和) and "Qin Xing" (勤興) all fell. In the off-exchange market, the older stocks such as "Zhong Hua" (中華), "Shi Jie" (世界), "Zha Bei" (閘北), and "Hua Shang" (華商) saw lows, while the rest remained stable.</p>
<p>Currently, the interest rate for the current "roll-over" transaction is between 9% and 11%. The price of "Yong Sha" shares was initially discounted by 6.3 yuan (貼價), then fell from 6.5 yuan to 5.6 yuan, before closing at 5 yuan. "Mei Ya" fell from 11 yuan to 8.5 yuan, but closed at 11 yuan. "Hua Feng" traded between 1.5 yuan and 2.8 yuan. "Xin Guang" traded between 3 yuan and 4.5 yuan. "Xin He" reached a high of 4 yuan and a low of 2.8 yuan before closing at 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Datong Yarn Factory (大通紗廠) is undergoing a capital increase, and trading of its shares will be suspended starting today. New shares of the Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity (閘北水電) company will be listed today. The number of shares for trading is temporarily set at 100,000.

<h3>Indian Cotton and Cloth Inspection Delegation Visits Japan; Discusses the Reality of the Japanese Cotton Spinning Industry</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] An Indian cotton and cloth inspection delegation of several people recently returned to their country via Shanghai after completing their inspection in Japan. According to the delegation leader, Mr. Jila Jiang (吉拉疆), although the Japanese cotton spinning industry currently has favorable conditions such as low wages and excellent equipment, problems have arisen with the supply of coal, and there is a labor shortage. Therefore, it is expected that by the end of next year, the Japanese cotton spinning industry's goal of operating 4 million spindles will probably not be achieved. The number of Japanese spindles has currently decreased to 2.2 million. Japanese 20-count yarn is currently priced at US$280 per piece. During this trip, the delegation concluded a contract with Japan to purchase 170,000 bales of Indian cotton. The cotton payment will be made through a credit loan, with payments spread over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 3%. It is said that the price of Indian cotton yarn is the lowest in the world. 20-count yarn currently costs only 440 rupees per piece, which is equivalent to only US$137.50 per piece.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to informed sources: Japan's current asking price for 20-count yarn is US$280 per piece. Our country's cotton yarn can also be sold at this price. The Indian cotton and cloth inspection delegation had informal discussions with related parties in our country during their visit to Shanghai. Our side stated that if the Indian side is interested in importing our country's cotton cloth, we are also willing to consider it.</p>

As a result, compared to the previous close, types A, B, and E remained flat, type C fell by 200 yuan, and type D rose by 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks felt good yesterday as trading increased. The supply from foreign and Guangdong merchants (廣帮) could hardly satisfy the strong demand from the securities and cotton yarn (紗花) gangs. Jardine shares (怡紗) opened at 940,000 yuan in the morning and approached the 1 million yuan mark at noon due to the reduction in the Hong Kong exchange rate. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Brewery rose by 10%, Jardine Textile, Guangdong Shipping, Telephone, Steel, and Xiang Tai each rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly.</p>

<p>To Ms. Fan Yi, a Reader from He County, Anhui: Your letter has been received and your illness noted. We immediately sent it to Dr. Liu Jianqiu, a gynecology expert, for an answer. We received a very detailed reply yesterday, which is transcribed below for your reference! "If your menstrual cycle has always been every six months or three months since it first started, it cannot be considered a disease. The normal color of menstrual blood is dark red. If it turns brown as it is about to end, it is because the flow is gradually slowing down. Small blood clots are common for ordinary people. If the blood clots are large, you should consult a doctor to check if there are tumors in your uterus."</p>
<p>"If you are mentally weak, have a pale complexion, and have headaches and fever, you should use a thermometer to check your temperature twice a day, morning and evening. If your temperature is elevated, you should consult an internist to check your body for tuberculosis, heart disease, kala-azar, etc. Your stool should also be checked for parasites, as parasites can also cause fever and abdominal discomfort."</p>

<h3>Pioneer of the Common People's Century</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang, written by Chen Yuan, published by Kaiming in early June this year</p>
<p>Most young people like to read biographies because the characters in biographies have a strong appeal and can evoke emotional resonance. A great historical figure who struggles against fate with unwavering spirit and achieves great success naturally deserves the love, respect, and praise of millions of people. However, we must not regard him as a god or superman. Viewing him as a god or superman easily creates a sense of separation in our minds, making us think that he is unattainable and that he lives outside the realm of reality. This is not a true understanding of him.</p>
<p>Many books about famous people that are published in bookstores tend to depict the characters as gods or supermen. Young people who read them may admire and praise them, but they only "worship" them and rarely feel motivated to emulate them further. Heroes are worthy of worship, but we don't need to teach young people to engage in incorrect hero worship by viewing them as gods or supermen. The traditional distorted concept of hero worship should be broken.</p>
<p>The great historical figures, like us, had flesh and blood, reason and emotion. For the sake of humanity, they lived among the people and relieved the suffering of the masses. Biographers should naturally grasp their true character—their human character—to express their great spirit. If they are written as gods or supermen, they lose their true character. Even if it inspires admiration, it is only worship of a deity, and it will not have any inspirational effect in the reader's heart.</p>
<p>"Pioneer of the Common People's Century" is Chen Yuan's new book. The thirteen articles collected here depict the people who heroically undertook arduous pioneering work in this unprecedented great century of the common people. The characters in this book can all be called heroes, true heroes, unlike the so-called "outstanding" emperors, officials, warlords, rulers, capitalists, and powerful politicians who are only concerned with their own positions. Their careers are a series of arduous struggles. In difficult and solitary battles, they are tested by the times and ultimately fulfill their aspirations of transforming society and saving humanity.</p>
<p>From the careers of these heroes, we can see that their achievements are entirely due to the purity of their motives and the sincerity of their work. From ideals to practice, we cannot find any miracles or any luck. We can all learn from them, and we should learn from them. As for how to learn from them, we must first have a correct and thorough understanding of them, recognize the process of their arduous struggles, and absorb their courage and spirit to nourish our own lives, so that our own blood is also infused with the blood of these people's heroes. Giants were originally the same as us. Once we understand why they became giants, we can no longer doubt that they are gods or supermen.</p>
<p>Having a correct understanding of these historical figures, let us briefly describe them one by one. The book is divided into four parts. The first part describes Roosevelt's great aspirations and achievements, divided into three articles. Roosevelt not only had an enlightened political mind but also transcendent vision. He is truly worthy of being a pioneer of the democratic century. Many people lament his death: if he were still alive, the world after World War II would not be so chaotic.</p>
<p>The second part consists of three articles, including Stalin, Kalinin, and Soviet scientists. The Stalin article quotes a majestic song by the famous poet Innokenty Annensky, comparing a great revolutionary to an eagle. Reading the article "Soldiers on the Scientific Front" allows us to understand how Soviet scientists lived and the predictions, organization, work, and development of many scientists in this new world. Their scientific research is for the happiness of the masses, and the results of their research are immediately integrated with practice, with the electrification of industry and agriculture, coupled with the high progress of industry and agriculture. The last section includes a translation of Pavlov's letter to young people, which can serve as a guide for scientific workers.</p>
<p>The third part is about Franklin, Thomas Paine, and Nehru. Franklin's greatness lies in "a popular scientist, a practical practitioner, and a brave fighter for democracy, all three personalities combined in one." It is no accident that a poor child from a printing worker's background still lives in the memory of Americans. Writing about Paine, the author uses the title "The Pursuit of Human Rights," which makes us yearn for it. Paine's epoch-making masterpiece "The Rights of Man" was published 155 years ago. Now that it is the century of the people, what profound significance should we have when reading this vivid and concise story of the birth of "The Rights of Man"? Only the first half of Nehru's life is written about. Nehru said: "Prison is my second home." Yes, revolutionaries go in and out of prison, just like going in and out of their homes. Prison life makes revolutionaries stronger and more courageous.</p>
<p>The four articles in the fourth part are about Romain Rolland, Tolstoy, Lu Xun, and Wells. These four prophets of culture all exposed the ugliness of society with their pens and shouted for the people. Romain Rolland is indeed the lighthouse of European wisdom. The radiance of his thought forever shines on the world. Where there is justice, there is Rolland's thought. Where there is truth, there is Rolland's thought. Tolstoy was equally great. He left the world two years after Rolland's death, in February 1945. His immortal literary legacy no longer belongs only to the Soviet Union, but to the entire world and all of humanity. Mr. Lu Xun was even more of an unprecedented cultural fighter for the Chinese nation. His anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-fascist thoughts have already sprouted in every corner of China. Wells, who was both a scientist, historian, and thinker, passed away not long ago. He always had hope, and all of his works consistently looked at the optimistic side of the future history of humanity.</p>
<p>The clear and lively writing and vivid descriptions in this book are sure to interest readers. Although the characters written about are diverse and multifaceted, they are all restored to being human, not "legendary" figures growing up in utopia. The good images used inside can also make people feel a sense of intimacy and admiration. This is a good reading material for young people to improve their self-cultivation and a material for self-education.</p>
<h3>Research on the Psychology of Propaganda</h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>(Compiled and translated by Sa Kongliao, published by Gengyun Publishing House)</p>
<p>In the modern academic world, there has been significant progress in applying psychology to study various sciences, such as educational psychology, criminal psychology, literary psychology, and commercial psychology. Based on the theories of psychology, various problems and viewpoints are examined in detail, and there are good results in both theory and practice. The book "Research on the Psychology of Propaganda" uses psychology as a starting point to analyze and explore various issues in propaganda. A close reading of the book's contents reveals that it partially develops the theories of child psychology, differential psychology, social psychology, abnormal psychology, and applied psychology. However, the book's purpose is not only this. Its main purpose is to target the propaganda methods of the Nazi fascists and use psychology to explain how the deceptive propaganda methods of the Nazi fascists could grow, and then prove the reasons for their eventual failure.</p>
<p>The translator compiled and translated the book from the English book "The New Propaganda" by Amber Blanco White. White's purpose in writing this book was to discuss whether the Nazi fascist propaganda methods could be adopted by progressive political parties in Britain, but the compiler expanded the content, aiming to make Chinese readers understand the nature, influence, and inevitable results of Nazi fascist propaganda.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts: Part 1, Propaganda in the Eyes of Dictators; Part 2, Reasons Why People Accept Propaganda; and Part 3, Psychological Effects of Propaganda Rule by Dictatorial Governments. Each part is further divided into five or six chapters. In particular, the chapters discussed in Part 2, such as "On the Masses," "On Leaders," "Anxiety, Criminal Intent, and Hostility," "People and Rulers," and "Substitutes for Happiness," have novel arguments and in-depth explorations, which are thought-provoking! The various sounds discussed in Part 3 seem trivial and scattered because the issues involved are too broad. If this third part is compared with the first part to illustrate the confirmation of both the success and failure of Nazi fascist propaganda, the strength seems to be lacking. However, because the original author was deeply influenced by the theories of Freud, a famous modern Austrian psychologist, he applied psychology to the study of political and economic phenomena and concluded with the problems of propaganda psychology. His research methods pay attention to social roots and focus on the analysis of human psychology. From this point of view, the book is still of great academic value.</p>
<p>Using propaganda as a political tool dates back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods in our country. Shang Yang had stories of posting notices with rewards for moving a pole and posting notices with punishments for moving a pole. At that time, it was to establish the government's credibility through propaganda. However, it was not until the beginning of the 20th century that propaganda was truly used as a weapon for political struggle, starting in Europe. By the time of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany, propaganda was completely played with and became the most powerful weapon in politics. They tightly grasped the reaction of the people's psychology and even launched wars of aggression. In the past, during the war, we often talked about the issue of "nerve warfare," which was when Hitler used psychological warfare to the extreme. Internally, the aggressors created anxiety, criminal intent, and hostility in the minds of the people. Externally, they sought satisfaction through offensive looting. However, they finally suffered the consequences of deceiving the people and were defeated and destroyed! This is a great lesson for future generations.</p>
<p>Now, after the end of World War II, unfortunately, mankind is still living an anxious and psychologically insecure life. At present, the two major groups, the United States and the Soviet Union, are showing various political and economic confrontations, and they are fiercely competing with each other with major propaganda efforts. In fact, these situations are also using psychological warfare tactics to compete. However, history has painfully revealed to us that in order for propaganda to be effective, it must be compatible with the psychology of the receiver of the propaganda. That is to say, we must understand the psychological state of the public. After the second tragic war, the only thing the public needs is world peace and a longing for a happy and prosperous life. Therefore, we have no reason to create incidents of anxiety, criminal intent, and hostility in people's minds and repeat the mistakes of the Fascist Nazis!</p>
<p>The book said in the introduction: "Studying propaganda can help people understand that propaganda has a vital interest in them and can be alert; it can also make the government understand the true value of propaganda, and that abuse is not only useless but also harmful. It will no longer regard propaganda as a panacea for politics, but will recognize that only true democracy can stabilize the country. … Although the research center of this book is placed on the propaganda policies of Nazi fascist countries, its purpose is not only to study their propaganda policies, but to hope that readers can draw inferences from one instance, thereby acquiring more useful practical knowledge."</p>
<p>After reading this book, I thought about the overall situation of the world, and my mood felt both relaxed and heavy. I think readers are all concerned about the current situation, and if you read this book, it may give you some benefits.</p>

<h3>Yu Ru's "Distant Love"</h3>
<p>First, let me state that this book has been introduced by many people already. Mr. Mao Dun's preface is the best interpretation of this book. In just two or three thousand words, he has fully covered the strengths and weaknesses of this work by Huo, regarding structure, layout, writing techniques, and the depiction of human nature.</p>
<p>But I still want to express my feelings. "Distant Love" is a biography of a newcomer's growth, a record of a warrior's battle with her inner self and with the environment. It contains too much of the spirit of the times. It writes about the joys, sorrows, and anger of the youth of the era, and there is a part of you and a part of me in it. "To see the world in a grain of sand," perhaps your and my gains are not entirely the same, but frankly speaking out these trivial impressions will not detract from this book that records the pulse of the times.</p>
<p>A noble woman, yet not a illusory figure, she is flesh and blood, a product of this era. As Mao Dun said well:</p>
<p>"Rowena's era is different from that of her mother's generation twenty years ago, but it can also be said that some things are still the same. Twenty years ago, Nora stepped out of the circle of etiquette and the puppet family to become a 'dignified person.' Now, Rowena must break away from the narrow circle of selfish love, from the comfortable but numbing living environment, and turn away."</p>
<p>The author, Yu Ru, uses "the lyrical atmosphere that female writers are good at" to carefully analyze the psychological process of the heroine Rowena's struggle with "selfish love." It is the era that allows Rowena's discerning eyes to see through everything; it is also the era that creates a distance between Rowena and her husband, Porter. He could comfortably arrange his life in a small family, but after a struggle, she finally jumped out of this small cage. The era is the force that determines everything. It is vast and surging, rushing forward, washing away sand, stones, and mud. But who is leading this irresistible force? — Still people, still the Rowenas who have been influenced by the times and in turn influence the times.</p>
<p>What is lovely is Rowena's awakening; no, what is even more lovely is the psychological struggle after Rowena's awakening, and her actions put into practice after a cruel psychological struggle.</p>
<p>Gao Yuan doesn't understand her. — As a little wife, he understands her; as a social fighter, her actions are far beyond his understanding.</p>
<p>Lei Jia may not understand her either — perhaps Lei Jia understands this era better and is closer to her, but a "Rudin-type" character, able to speak but not act, even if he understands the needs of this era better, he will still not completely understand their own needs. Or even if they understand a little, they are only "giants in words, dwarfs in action."</p>
<p>Rowena is normal, is ordinary, she does not have excessive heroic character, and doesn't like to show off. She just does what the times demand of her, and she does it — without the slightest mistake.</p>
<p>But in the eyes of Lei Jia and Gao Yuan, what kind of person has she become? — When Gao Yuan quietly asked Lei Jia: "Have you proposed to her?" "No way, to her, we are not her match... She is a devil, she is a god, not a human being! Their whole family is like that!" This is Lei Jia's answer.</p>
<p>What moves us is how Gao Yuan and Rowena married out of a simple love, and after marriage, only lust remained. Gao Yuan loves her, but what he loves is not her knowledge, understanding, awakening... but the aspect of her as a little wife. She also loves Gao Yuan, but she finds inadequacy and dissatisfaction in this simple love. How did a distance arise between them, and what kind of psychological struggle did they go through? Rowena crossed Gao Yuan's constraints and walked her own path. The author writes about this entire process vividly.</p>
<p>What I want to explain is: Rowena seems very real in our eyes, and is not damaged by her heroic character. I think this is because the author has infused "humanity" into the heroine. The author subtly writes about her psychological changes, one layer deeper than another. Therefore, her actions, in our eyes, do not feel sudden at all.</p>
<p>When Gao Yuan misunderstands her, she is in pain.</p>
<p>"I can't get his understanding," she murmured to herself, "He won't understand me, he hasn't even tried to understand the whole era... Between us, there is already a very deep chasm. I can't go back. These times, I have spurred myself with a harsh will, without even time to stop and breathe. But I can only move forward endlessly..."</p>
<p>She is the embodiment of reason. She sees deeply, thinks deeply, and therefore, she also works very calmly. But she is not a person without emotions. When Gao Yuan finds someone else and writes to her to show off, destroying the little bit of simple love that was maintained between them, her pain is extraordinary — she was sick for three weeks because of this.</p>
<p>A person of flesh and blood, a person who dares to love and hate, a person who can hold reason and control emotions — originally, she is just an ordinary person. But she is unfamiliar with this world, and this world is also unfamiliar with her. Society cannot tolerate her, and friends, even her husband, cannot understand her. If she is a brave person, she has to fight the environment; if she succumbs, the fate of a "domestic pigeon" awaits her.</p>
<p>This ordinary person, we call "a newcomer." This is the tragedy of the times — not that she is not close enough to us, but that we, due to some selfish mentality, dare not get close to her, not that she has any fault that makes us unable to approach, but that we have too many weaknesses. Before these weaknesses are completely washed away, we are afraid to approach her, even ashamed to glance at her face to face.</p>
<p>However, she will eventually slowly influence us; because of the results of her struggle, she will influence this era.</p>
