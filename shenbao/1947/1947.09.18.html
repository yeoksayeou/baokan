<p>中國自從通商以來，對外貿易總是站在不利的地位上，除去偶爾有一兩年出超以外，歷年都是入超的，有時幾千萬元，有時四五億元，所幸我們還有一項很重要的無形收入，就是華僑匯款，抵補了很大一部，分的人超。說起我們的出口，還是得力於外人的推銷，例如大豆，是經過日本人在東北使用種種便利辦法，又在國外推銷宣傳，才能大量的輸出。又如桐油豬鬃，我國商人多半只把它運到漢口和上海，至於如何運出，如何推銷，如何劃一標準品質，都是外國洋行來設法經營，中國商人當時很少能懂得國外市塲和推銷情形，所以很少自己可以直接出口。</p>
<p>發展對外貿易　注意農產加工</p>
<p>一般人都說工業重要，這個道理當然是不錯的，但是貿易一項更爲重要。因爲無論是國內貿易或國外貿易，這種「懋遷有無」才可以達到「物盡其用」的效力，不致於「貨棄於地」。換句話說，就是「以其所有，易其所無」，這是經濟原則上的最高的效用。比方說：我們的桐油豬鬃在國內就消費不了這許多，如果不運出去，就成了廢物。假使把它輸出去換成機器，豈不是我們工業的目的，可以用貿易的方法建設一部份嗎。何況我們現在是農業國家。出口都是農產品，這種農產品的出口，都有各別加工的必要，方可使得貿易更為發達，所以我們建設工業，應當首先注單刷　農物的加工工業，以上這些話，說起來好像和外匯平　委員會沒有多大關係似的，實際上却是講求外匯平衡的必備條件。平衡會的工作，現在對外匯是量入爲出，如果對外貿易能設法推廣，我們的外匯收入自然增加，就可以拿這種收入作爲建設工業，購買機器的用處，我們工業的建設，豈不是就從貿易上建設成功嗎？所以我說貿易比工業尤爲重要。</p>
<p>希望外匯收入　能夠逐步增加</p>
<p>現在社會一般人士好像對於平衡會很關心，而不甚注意利用這個機會來推廣貿易，貴會今天大家來討論對外貿易問題，眞是抓住現在這個問題的核心。諸君或爲友邦來華經商，或爲各地商業領袖，我們深信散會以後，一定能彼此合作，利用這個機會，來發揮我們中國對外貿易的效用，這是値得欽佩的，尤其平衡會對於今後對外貿易更爲關心，希望外滙的收入能够逐步增加，使得進口和出口都能滿足我們的需要。至於黑市問題，在管理貿易之下，除非全面管制，都免不了產生黑市，例如車票，船票有黑市，戲票也有黑市，許許多多方面都有黑市，而且不僅中國有，就是各國也都有黑市。我可以說，一天我們不能開放自由貿易，不能無限制供給外匯，黑市總是免不了的，可是黑市的存在，並不一定就會根本危害正當市塲，現在我們的外匯旣視實際情形隨時作合理的行動，可以希望出口能以推廣和僑匯不致走漏。（下文轉入第二版）</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕民社黨要員現任府委徐傅霖，十七日語記者，該黨參加全國普選之提名問題，在黨內雖經商定，但迄未交與政府，因三黨共同商洽之比例分配問題，至今未能獲有決定。政府欲兩黨光交名單，但兩黨則盼政府光定比例，是以在原則上未獲結果時，該黨名單自不能先行交出也。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕中和橋慘案共犯美兵賽凡尼部份，十七日止午九時續審，定十八日晨開庭辯論。</p>
<h3>陳光甫書面談話　上文接第一版　必須刻苦節約　增產推廣輸出</h3>
<p>目下是過渡時期，我們缺乏美元，正和世界各國一樣，所以不能不節省用途。即以英國來說，他有四百年貿易出超的歷史，又在經濟，幣制，航業等方面，都是首屈一指的，可是自兩次大戰以來，困難”深，第一次大戰後廢除了金本位，這次又停止兌換美元，朝野上下都以堅絕的精神過着刻苦的生活，厲行節約，設法增加出口，其精神可以供我們的效法。我們一般平民的生活是低到無可再低，現在提倡節約，就是在我們來此開會的人，和一些住在上海比較富有的人，要能實行。今後我們厲行節約，同時大家來勞力增加生產，推廣轍出，同心合力，量入爲出，自力更生，以渡過這個艱苦的階段。胡樸安先生在他所著的「儒家之修養」一本書裏說到，我們飲食要簡單，就可以减少慾念，慾念一少，種種不正當貪財事件就可以减少，此是儒家參合佛家的精神。幾千年來，我們中國是以簡樸持身治家，我們中國生活情形，現在是不能看工業發達的美國榜樣，如果我們要仿照美國人的生活水準，就得再等到我們的工業也經發達之後，否則，我們的國力就無形中在此享受慾望裏面消耗完了，永難翻身。近來大家主張自力更生，這就是自力更生的哲學。</p>
<p>這次對外匯新辦法，不過是過渡期間的一種措施，鄙人是由中央銀行推舉主持其事，會中章則還在核定之中。新辦法的好處，在前天開會時，張禹九先生曾經說：「因爲過去外滙滙率維持「釘住不變」政策，幾經改價，仍難維特出口，八月間頒行新辦法，將過去「釘住不變」之官價，改爲機動性之市價」。歷次的改價都是在推廣出口，釘住不變，黨非是想維持穩定，但事實上不能如所期望，故採機動性，就是呌中國如何能推廣出口。最近我們外匯的收支情形已經好轉，不平衡的差額已經比以前减少了百分之五十，這都是我們政府當局開明的措施，也是中央銀行在張公權先生領導之下，施行切合實際情形賢則的計劃，以及許多在事的人日夜辛動檢討的結果，所得的方案，鄙人垂暮之年，勉强担任此事，自愧毫無貢獻。</p>
<p>如何沙滅黑市　端賴朝野合作</p>
<p>再談到消滅黑市，最重要的要靠經濟手段，就是要大家都能減少需求，不問黑市購買外匯，需求之能否減少，問題很前難蘭，如果都能不問黑市購買外匯，則黑市外匯無人需要，自然不會上漲，黑市不漲，則國內物價安定，出口貨的成本自然不會提高。凡是只願私私不顧大衆，以向黑市爭取來滿足自己慾望，只圖一己之便利，其無形中為害大衆以及影響經濟上各種問題，是無法形容的，故希望一種政策之能否收效，全視全國人民能否充份合作，最為重要；故希望大家開會以後，回去領導工商界一致合作，以渡過目前的難關。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>沈痛的回憶和光明的前瞻</h3>
<p>「九一八」的來到，必然地，會使每一個中國人引起沈痛的回憶。這回憶是多方面的，他們想起這十六年來的種種遭遇：日本帝國的衰落與滅亡，中國民族歷史鬥爭的勝利完成，以及這十六年來的種種國際關係的演變。面對着當前的中國與世界的形勢，當茲紀念日的來臨，懲前毖後，我們不能不有所　惕。</p>
<p>我們首先要指出的是：我們是一個具有豐富歷史意識的民族。兩千年來我們沈浸在儒家的傳統思想之下，不是一個專尙情感，而是情感和理智並重的民族。在情感方面，我們不欲强調我們沈痛經歴的重述。今日日本的軍閥已經崩潰，日本遭遇着新生，正向民主的大道邁進。中日兩民族在經過了這一次慘痛的經騐以後，應該此後便能密切合作。在人民與人民之間，不應該再有嫉恨種子的滋長。在這個意義下，我們願日本人民在軍閥崩潰以後，眞能够遭逢新生，走向民主的大道。正惟其如此，所以對於近來從日本傳來的消息，却使我們不得不抱着相當的隱　。保守勢力甚而至於反動勢力的繼續存在，封建甚而至於軍閥的餘毒，如今却加上了民主的們裝，公然流傳；凡此種種：一方面果由於佔領當局的寬容，究其實際，也未必一定對日本人民爲有利。茲當「九一八」十六周年之日，我們要軍提這一點來促　佔領當局及日本人民的注意。</p>
<p>當然「九一八」使我們回想到當時國際聯盟的無能，而终於使人類遭遇了第二次世界大戰之厄。中國人民感到國際聯盟的無能，早就憧憬於一個强有力的國際組織的產生。所以由於第二次世界大戰所流的血而產生的聯合國組織，中國人民寄予股切的期望和熟誠的支持。全世界的人類爲了確保世界和平，必須使此一國際組織能充分發揮它的權力。在我們的範圍以內，由於我們自身所受的慘痛經騐，對此聯合國組織之衷誠支持，不待多言。然而不幸的是此一國際組織產生以來，它的一切活動，未必能盡如世人的理想。我們不能說任何一國有破壞此一級織的陰謀，它之所以未能如我們的理想者，正如嬰兒的誕生以後，容易招致疾病一樣；我們得好好調治，使這嬰兒能滋長發育，以至成年。</p>
<p>今天我們紀念「九一八」的十六周年，已經在我們坑戰勝利後的第三個年頭，而東北的局勢，尙未回復到正常，這試不免使我們感觸多端。我們深知東北乃至整們戰後中國局勢的發展，原有內在的與外來的兩種因素在起着作用。就內在的方而言，顯然的這是由於共匪的作亂。因此，我們今日來紀念這沈痛的日子，必以我們的全力於最短期內來完成我們的戡亂。匪亂戡定以後，東北的局勢，不難迅速回復正常。就外來的方面言，中國戰後局勢之發展到現階段，主要實由於華盛頓方面的沒有明確堅定的政策。孫副主席於一昨接見合衆社記者時，就指出美國之遠東政策不够堅定，且太含糊。此其結果，一方面造成了共匪今日的氣燄，一方面促使蘇聯的疑慮，因而多少影　於中蘇條約的履行。誠如孫副主席所云：「中國必須在兩强之間掙扎，使其自身能適合於目前以及長久將來　最有利之地位」。我們如今已到了一個須要重新決定的時候，這決定，對於我們此後的民族命運，無疑地，關係貿在至爲重要。</p>
<p>從沈痛的回憶瞻　到將來，我們不難看到光明的遠景。目前我們的處境雖至艱苦，但在艱苦之中，我們更應加强我們的自信。我們從外授垂絕的艱苦抗戰中過來，主要是由於我們之具有不可動搖的信念，抗戰必勝的信念。如今的局面未如我們的理想，我們更應加强我們建國必成的信念：不可動搖的信念是一切成功的　石。有了這一信念，我們就會有燦爛的希望：從而可以看到光明的遠景。徒然沉沒於沈痛的回憶是無用的，我們要從沈痛的回憶中看到我們光明的將來，提高我們的信念。</p>
<p>對外貿易的重建</p>
<p>全國對外貿易會議，定於今日閉幕。本報對於此一會議之召開，旣會著論；茲當閉幕之日，更願一言，任何人都感覺到目前我國經濟局勢的艱難。我們要克服當前的危難，主要在如何重建我們的輸出貿易。這不但需要計劃，需要方案，而且更重在實行。中國自對外通商以來，我們的輸出貿易，向來就在洋商的操縱之下；我國如今要看建我們的輸出貿易，自然當以國家民族利益爲第一義。</p>
<p>講到發展我國的對外貿易，這不但與我國的外匯資產息息相關，而且也關係我們的建國大業。張行政院長對此旣會發表書面談話，平準外　基金委員會主委陳光甫氏，又向義會發表書面談話，政府對於對外貿易的注意，於此可見。陳氏的談話，句句出於至誠，從爲人之道，講到貿易經濟，尤値得我們深思。他說：「凡是只顧私利，不　大家，以黑市爭取（外匯）來滿足自己慾，只關一己之便利，其無形中爲害大衆，以及影響經濟上省種問題，是無法形容的。」茲當對外貿易會議閉幕之日，我們　從事於輸出的貿易商能和政府當局衷誠合作，來重建我們的輸出貿易。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾竭力主張　改革聯合國制度　建議設立新執行機構處理國際爭端　維辛斯基展緩提出答覆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：美國務卿馬歇爾向聯合國大會發表其政策演說後，蘇聯外次維辛斯　突然要求撤銷原定於今日下午發表之演說。動機何在，未予說明。據一般猜測，或係蘇方需要時間，俾就馬歇爾之演說作充分研究，甚或有等待莫斯科新訓令之必要。至於維辛斯　將於何時向聯大發表蘇聯之政策演說，尙無徵象可尋。按維氏係於星期二要求聯合國將其名字排人今日發表演說者之名單上，其後因獲悉馬歇爾之演說對蘇聯大施攻擊，故突改變初衷。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：聯合國大會組織工作，已於昨夜完成，一般辯論自今日開始，美國務卿馬歇爾首先發言，其他發言者預定爲蘇聯，墨西哥·波間·加拿大·南非·烏技圭及澳大利亞之代表。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十七日電〕美國務鄉馬歇爾今日宣稱：美國國接受五强在安理會否決權之嚴格限制，幷正式建議在聯合國大會中，設立五十五國常務委員會，保持繼續開會。渠云此項建議，無與承認安理會已完全失敗。渠提義設立常務委員會，此係一終年開會具體而微之聯合國大會，以監視全世界及安理會，以便在安理會未能照需究成其任務時，參與其間提出建議。</p>
<p>馬歇爾在本日大會召開時之辯論中致辭，提出此項主張，此爲馬歇爾對美蘇外交戰常前階段之第一砲。蘇代表維辛斯基預定於本日下午答覆。</p>
<p>馬歇爾並不吞吐其辭，渠警吿稱：世界面臨危機，促大會代表注意世界各地人民皆深懼「渠等將捲入新而更可怕之面突」。渠毫不遲疑，將世界一切混亂之咎　加諸蘇聯。渠率直指斥蘇聯妨碍聯合國行動，不阻止對希臘之敵仇與侵略行動，並將朝鮮獨立延誤一切過失加諸蘇聯。</p>
<p>馬歇爾涉及此次大會所應辯論之一切主要問題，並將美國計劃及政策，以各種不同程度，細加陳述。其中包括：</p>
<p>七項重大問題　亟須謀取解</p>
<p>（一）「否決權問題」：非聯合國會員國申請入會以及執行安理會一切決議方面，美國願憲接受取消否決權之議，祗須所建議之辦法係屬過當者，惟牽涉安理會裁判行動之決議，則不在其列。馬氏並主張設立一特別委員會，硏究如何消除「濫用」否決權之問題，俾向下屆聯大提出報吿，藉使在表決規則方面有所改善。</p>

<p>關於否決權問題，王外長重申中國代表國相信唯一可實行之舉，乃由聯合國大會「藉就聯合國憲軍條款，加以適當之解釋」，對否決權之使用，規定一合理之限制。王外長籲請一切國家政策，以國際主義之目標是趨，而不應僅顧一己之私利。渠稱，建立集體安全制度，不能迅速完成，因請國人對所發生之甚多嚴重困難，勿惑失望或困擾，而應加倍努力，爲聯合國之理想而奮門。</p>

<h3>中美發起人夤夜枵腹會議　聯合電廠草約完成　資本美金二千萬中美各半　發電量目標每日十萬瓩</h3>

<h3>西康夷族請願代表團　對本來報記者發抒信念　安寧河的新潮</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日訊〕在川康滇三角地帶、金沙江的兩岸，縱斷山脈的峯　澗谷間，是夷族同胞的生活天地。以西昌爲中心，或沿着雅龍江的支流安寗河，是往昔鴉片　進的門路，今日正是新觀念新知識新生活輸入的大道。夷族同胞們已發現了他們所處區域的荒僻，使他們沒有受到充分的注意，認爲如果民主不滲透到全國各地，是夷族同胞和國家的雙重不幸。於是，他們自發地決定晋京請願，交通不便和多餘困阻都被打破，經昆明重慶兩地，先後到首都會集。他們首先對記者說述了此次請願的目的：</p>
<p>「我們請願的目的，是需使我們有時時向政府陳述本族情形的機會，如參加立法，是使將來制定的法律，在邊地行得通。參加監察，是爲了促成邊地一切政治經濟文化等之合法合理的進行。參加省參議會，是使一切議案，顧全人民利益，獲取人民擁戴，把數千年懸而未決的邊務，澈底解決。百數十萬陷於水深火熱的邊胞，與政府聯繫起來，變成眞正中華民國的人民，纔合予國父所說：「國內民族一律平等」的原則。我們誠懇的希望並請求全國同胞寄予我們同情與有力的援助。」</p>
<p>西康一百五十萬的邊胞中，納稅完糧的人民佔五十多萬，而漢藏族在西康的總計一百七十萬，但是西康省參議會　知連一個夷族參議員也沒有。他們認爲；這種</p>
<p>分配不平均</p>
<p>的現象，對於邊胞住區的各種建設的落後，實有很大的責任。目前夾區亦在的問題尙是一切待開發區域的共通的急迫問題，交通·敎育·衛生·件件都値得加强我們的工作。</p>
<p>夷區不是荒山沙漠，而是蘊藏豐饒出產富足的地帶，但因爲交通不便，天然的資源不但不能開發，雷馬屏峨的餘　穀在抗戰初期曾經因倉備過剩而予以焚燬。現在，除了西昌</p>
<p>對外有空運</p>
<p>外，便祗有一條公路貫穿着安寧河谷，交通之不便，使夷區貨棄於地，而九十里一站的旱路，更阻撓着敎育的推行。現在，夷區有三所中學，九所小學，中小學生夷漢共計在內，只兩千多人，公立的學校因地點的關係發展不易，土司和人民領袖辦的學校却又有很多不易解決的困難。夷族同胞的求知慾很强，而且都</p>
<p>願意學漢文</p>
<p>但他們是先學說話後學識字，這種間接的學習法，加上入學年齡較晚（十歲）及敎材敎具的不適合和欠缺，夷區的敎育亟待外援。同樣的，夷區的衛生保健工作尤其需要外援，一顆阿司必靈是了不起的寳貝，夷胞至今把疾病看得像魔鬼一樣可怕。滬在遠東區　本敎育研究會議方始閉幕時，令人覺得如何建立夷族的生活基礎一事，是刻不容緩的。</p>
<p>跟着時代進步，夷族同胞接受了民主的敎育，他們</p>
<p>針對着現實</p>
<p>發出了呼聲：『我們的請願是合理的，參與政治和建設夷區是我們的權科，也是我們的義務，我們期望這一弱小民族愛國的舉動，能得到所有的了解，同情，與支持』。（記者濮德玠）</p>

<h3>川島芳子　其鳴也哀　繫獄兩年　文長二千　鐵窗氣息　躍然紙上</h3>
<p>〔本報北平十七日電〕繫獄將及二年尚未定　之金碧輝，（一名川島芳子），邇來在女監之敎育班中努力學習國文，並學作文章。昨出庭爲津市民閭桐軒房產糾紛案作證時，曾袖出文章一篇，題爲「我的監獄生活兩年了」，擬交記者在本來報發表。該文　述其獄中生活苦況外，並對昔日與其寸步不離「小猴」（小福）備致其不勝　念之忱。繼即呼籲人們善視失掉主人們善視失掉主人的猴子小福，文中稱：「他是聰明可愛的小支動物，他沒有犯罪，他不會賣國的。我是他的小主人，我敢說這句話」。最後筆錄一轉，為自己辯白，謂：「難道說我小主人還不如他，眞寃，我絕不會出賣國家，我忘不了我的祖國。小福！小福！你的主人決不會是漢奸」！文長二千除字，鐵窗孤苦，躍然紙上，蓋亦「烏之將死，其鳴也哀」歟？（特派員張劍梅）</p>
<h3>空頭大商店作保　閩糧犯遠台灣</h3>
<p>〔本報福州十五日訊〕林森縣田糧處副處長林子佩以貪汚凟職罪判處四年徒刑，業誌本報。該犯以因病經法院准予交保，引起此間政府，參議會，輿論界的重視。省政府以林犯遽爾交保，難免招引物議，曾備函咨請法院答復，省縣市各級參議會紛派參議員到法院質詢交保經過，輿論機關以林犯保出後復　軍招搖過市，未見病容，法院殊涉徇私縱放之嫌，各報指責甚力。關於林犯交保經過，經探悉：該犯於判決之後，獄吏上了兩張簽呈，爲該犯病重交保，承辦推事命帶庭騐察，獄吏回禀法官犯人病重不能老動，因此即予交保。交保之前，該犯佈置頗爲周密，先着人在南台開設號稱擁有二十億元大資本之空頭商店二家作其出獄交保之舖號，迨保出後，不數日即行遠颺台灣，至此可見此米蛀蟲之狡點萬端與夫法院之徇私枉法，輿論譁然，法院至今尙無任何表示。</p>
<h3>平幷行總舞弊犯　移送幷法院究辦</h3>
<p>〔中央社太原十七日電〕行總晋綏察分署專委兪白樺，儲運組副主任兼北平倉庫主任鄭祖蔭，暨北平海關西苑機塲辦事處主任沈維善，利用職權，共同舞弊，經行總顧問李廣和檢舉，各犯先後在幷平就逮，並已移送法院法辦，緣兪白樺取得聯總職員安定遠（比人係洪洞敎區神父）同意，假洪洞敎區救濟物資爲名，由行總空運大隊，于六月廿日至廿二日，三次由平運幷棉布八十三包，兪在平原以每公斤五萬元運價，承運商號棉布七十包，至運幷提貨時，發覺　布有二十七包非集承運，遂向訂運布商勒索二億元，貨主以在平已出運價，遂向李廣和檢舉事　爲兪在平承運棉布事，爲海關西苑機塲主任沈雜善知悉，遂乘　要挾，分署在平主管儲運之倉庫主任鄭祖　代運棉布二十七包，鄭恐事機改露，遂允其請，沈以所得，贈鄭三千萬元，兪犯運　之　布五十六包，係幷市德祥　家　，共計　　二億九千四百六十三萬元，此款兪獲得前，則爲　顧問發覺，幷加以監視，沈維　代理之棉布二十七包，係幷市協興植等七家者，每公斤運費四萬元，沈共　款一億餘，彼等貪汚所得，係運費差額，蓋空運大隊運輸平幷間救濟物資，每公斤僅一九五三元。</p>
<p>〔本報台北十三日航訊〕台灣多的是木材，但是却到處鬧木荒，這一點林業行政和交通運輸多應該要負責的。爲了木材的不易獲得供應，造紙工業首先就遭到困厄。紙業公司台北紙廠，原是</p>
<h3>竹漿紙新猷　台省造紙工業　踏上了轉捩點</h3>
<p>我國唯一的木漿製紙工廠，但現在也不得不着手探討代替原料。</p>
<p>台中，新竹，宜蘭一帶，盛產桂竹。在正常經濟狀態下，竹本貴於木，然面現在竹的價格却比木材低三分之一，而且木材算體積，竹算重量，竹的產地低，運輸又方便，在這許多有利條件下，日本人過去曾苦心研究試騐過。世界煮竹標準法原用蘇打（即燒碱），日本人也發明過重亞硫酸鎂法，可是這兩種方法多無法適合今日的環境；燒碱一噸近台幣五十萬元，做一磅紙的燒碱，還不够半磅紙價，而且紙張幣淡黃色；重亞硫酸鎂法所需的氧化鎂，原係來自東北，而今匪共滋擾，已無法取給，同時這個方法的缺點在漂白困難。</p>
<p>台北紙廠會利用原有的製本漿機及重亞硫酸鈣液，試煮竹料所得竹漿品質很劣，後經該廠林廠長在該藥液中摻入微量鹹性物質，在攝氏一百四十度蒸煮十二小時，竟發現了幾點驚人的成就：一·漂白極易，漂至雪白只需百分之四的有效氯。二·打漿迅速，二小時即可抄紙。三·紙質優於木漿紙。四·白度較蘇打法及氣化鎂法高。五·以此法處理蘆　蔗渣等成效仍極優異。這樣一來，可以代替了東北的氣化鎂，而藥料又係本省所產，取給不站，尤其是它的經濟價値，値得稱道，因爲台灣更有取用不站的原料——竹，在以往竹子祗能爲台灣人供應竹筍，傢具！</p>
<p>在紙荒聲中，這是台灣造紙工業的一大轉機，據估計一天生產四，五十噸的紙張絕無問題。台北廠為這個新猷，已擬辦理專利手續！（記者楊文育）</p>

<h3>大同大學超額收費　學生自治會昨招待記者　報告家長籌措困難情形</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立大學本學期收費問題，曾經上海市專科以上學校聯合會，決定學雜費合計，最高不得超過一百六十萬元，於上月廿三日吳市長等在國際飯店宴請各界捐助獎學金大會上，由光華大學校長朱經農及前敎育局長顧毓琇當衆宣佈，成爲定案。據悉大同大學現違反上項決議，超額收費，引起學生不滿。</p>
<p>昨日下午三時，大同大學學生自治會，假香雪園招待記者、有所報吿。該會負責人報吿該校收費情形時，音調低沉，似不勝其悲憤者。據稱：大同大學本學期學雜費，經校方公佈，定爲一百八十萬元、連同試騐費一百零四萬元，總計高達二百八十餘萬元。同學家長多屬薪水階級，家有二三子弟在學者，極爲普遍，經此戰亂之餘，誰有餘蓄足資週轉，且　來工商凋敝，米球薪桂，一百六十萬元之學費，籌措已感困難，今校方違棄市政當局規定，擅將賣額提高至如此程度，多數同學　將被迫失學，特迫切呼籲社會寄予同情，並報告向校方提出下列六項要求：（一）學雜費最高爲一百六十萬元；（二）分兩期繳費，先付半數；（三）淸寒同學先註册上課，後繳費；（四）設立免費額：百分之十五全免，百分之十半免；（五）敎職員薪給，亦分兩期發給；（六）收回「勒令同學轉學處分」成命。最後該負責人報告該校辦理獎學金情形稱：大同大學連新生現有同學二三五〇人，（此係該校胡校長呈報上海市獎學金統一審核委員會之數目），校方核准全免學費者僅二十三人，免費四分之三者二十人，半免者一一二人，免費四分之一者三十人，以上共一八五人合全免一〇二人，加上校友會獎學金核准者九人，佔全校人數百分之四·九，按照政府規定獎學金全免額，應佔全校人數之百分之十，即應全免二三五人，其他免費額尙未計算在內云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕該會已分呈市政府，市參議會，及上海市獎學金統一審核委員會，報吿該校收費情形，吳市長並允於日內接見該會代表，有所垂詢。</p>

<h3>全國對外貿易會議　延長會期今日閉幕　張院長派代表宣讀書面談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國對外貿易會議，昨晨十時於中國銀行四褸　開，到會代表百餘人，由壽景偉主席。首先將蒞會外賓一一向大會介紹。繼即請英商會理事海約翰濱講，大意謂自中國管制進出口後，進口　面臨之困難，計有（一）進口限制後原料器材之進口銳减，使現存之工業維持困難，工業化之推進更感遲緩，（二）限額之宣布太驟，使工業界無法適應，浩成各種嚴重問題。而輸入許可證及外匯申請書之發給，均嫌過於遲緩。出口業之困難爲：（一）中國因物價工價太高，故產品不能取得國外市塲，（二）中國唯有發展農業，方能增加出口。主要之出口品如絲茶猪鬃桐油皮毛大豆等，如能選擇優良品種長期培養，提高品質建立國際信用，則均有大量出口希望，（三）中國之主要工業原斜棉花應全力增產，使能白給，棉花雖非出口品，但此舉可大最减輕外匯負担。海氏最後表示樂觀之見解，謂中國如有一長期計劃，則必能成爲一大生產中心，中國人勤苦勞作，故擴大出口之努力必有收穫。</p>
<p>楊格主張　獎盛輸出</p>
<p>請中央銀行顧問楊氏演說，楊氏主張我國應有一獎勵輸出之具體政策，已實行及應實行之措舉爲：（一）取消出口稅，（二）國內出口貨稅率之合理化，（三）匯率應保持合理，使土產能大量出口，（四）發掘合灣與東北之富源，使成爲出口之來源。繼之加拿大商務參贊高史達，英伊石油公司代表高登，均先後被邀致辭。</p>
<p>張院長派代表致詞</p>
<p>至是潘序倫到會，代表行政院長致訓，大意爲：（一）歡迎外商在筆投資，政府對有礙對外貿易之各因素，如成本過高囤積居奇等，均密切注意並補救，（二）米麥棉花爲衣食之源，應盡力增產，勿待外求。而農工商休戚相關，應密切合作。（三）商業道德應迅速恢復，方能大規模發展對外貿易。</p>
<p>繼由中蠶公司葛敬中，中紡吳味經，中行國外部經理隙長桐，及辛劍　、張肖梅，方善桂相繼致辭，大會至中午十二時始散。</p>
<p>下午討論　各組提案</p>
<p>午後二時許續開大會，討論各組提案審查報吿，計修正通過貿易政策小組，出口原料小組，金融小組，聯營小組，易貨連銷小組，機製品小親提案多件。討論過程中，間以來賓演說，美商務參贊凱爾台演說，凱氏檢討我國貿易之入超情形後，並指出謂入口已增至四億美元，而出口不足一半「農業爲出口業最好之友人」，如能减輕農民之負擔，以合理之收買價格鼓勵農民生產，則出口量必可大增，如絲織品羊毛毯大豆植物油等均可大量出口，易取外匯。滬江大學校長凌憲揚演說，謂發展我國之對外貿易，必須經注意下列兩事：（一）提高農民之購買力，改善農民生活，增加農業生產，（二）恢復我國原有之商業道德。全經會委員繆雲台致辭，贊成凌憲揭之主張，謂「農以生之，工以成之，商以營之」，三業休戚相關，宜密切配合。討論至四時半，因爭辯熱烈，提案未討論者尙多、決定延會一日。大會並連過褚軸成駱清華之臨時動議，通電王外長堅持四强否決權。</p>
<h3>粳秈價又回昂</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧七千六百餘石，內地續漲不已，追跦上騰。粳米回漲萬餘元，秈米去化香燥，猛漲二萬餘元，白元新粳均見騰昂一二萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉配價提高二千元，配額減少一半，原料又漸上漲，人心趨堅，統粉雜牌粉廠粉均見續漲六七千元，麩皮閩胃停辦，回挫二三千元，形勢止漲轉跌。豆餅彷彿。</p>
<p>黃豆油廠因食油猛跌，進胃全無，客帮不動，本街亦存看望，客方以護貨稀少，售心頗堅，勢成擯局。綠豆仍居挺秀，蠶豆零化續動，逐步高翔，再加二三千元。</p>
<p>芝蔴本街略取，高定次呆，生仁續疲萬元，苞米北洋仍然選高拾取，高料活潑，中次呆滯。紅糧來貨蟬聯，酒坊不貧，北洋不動，步劑三五千元。小麥產銷倒懸，續挺二三千元。　又訊：上海糧食總倉庫配售本市公敎人員食米，上月係以巴西白圓米配撥，各方均具好評。近以該項白圓米配撥無存，已改發巴西糙米，加工配售，此米雖亦來自巴西，但形狀較長，與圓米略異，惟食用頗佳云。</p>
<h3>十八日起試辦　麵粉自由買賣</h3>
<p>關於麵粉恢復自由買賣問題，經十七日午後四時，由中信局配給物資顧問委員會，召集各主要廠商及粉麩業商業同業公會會議，決定於十八日起暫行試辦。據悉：此次取消硬性低價拋售原因，大致與食油彷彿，茲爲防止麵粉倒流，商人套利及鼓勵生產計，不得不暫恢復自由買賣。該會爲愼重計，幷囑廠商之目由價格，當以各廠（一）在手存貨，（二）目前市價，（三）將來補空三項原則爲標準。</p>
<h3>華股過程多盤　後市臨收挺</h3>
<p>華股昨萎縮於先，穩定於後，銀根仍緊，交貨復湧。亨鼠議息被迫再增至二角二分半及二角七，午前復因下午更改單位之故，了結者居多，仍形下游，惟收買棉布款業已發出。人心稍定，是以午後各即交股反形微俏，惟因安換時情况屢有出入，過程多盤，臨收微露生機。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>見低，永紗開後，自二三四元及二三五元起，有一三三號等供給，迫低至二三〇元以內。一五四號等乘低稍納，在二三〇元光景頗費掙扎。盤旋至十時半後，塲外交貨更湧，息價開高至二角二分半及二角七分，終於不支而退。七六號等又賣，乃將永紗撳低至即交二二六元，遞交二六元低價，嗣經一一六號乘低維持，一〇四號來進現永紗，十一時十五分後，漸漸稍漲。二〇四號等買進遞永紗，一八一號等並扒現永紗，聞紗款已有發出，銀根可望轉機，曾回升至即交二三一元，及遞交二三二元之價。一七二號顯出現永紗，二一八號等亦了結遞永紗，午收遂以二二七元及二二八元之價結束收後喊價平穩。餘股亦被帶小，尤以小型熟股爲最多。結果嚴前收計即交股永紗美亞華豐一永公微挫，新華勤興尙平，中法新光景福信和各跌半成，中絲平平，景綸跌落一成弱，內衣新亞降落半成，永業小升，餘均微挫。遞交股計永紗華豐跌落不多，信和美亞新光景福各　半成，勤興跌一成弱。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>做即交，塲外報價已高，聞火油有結款，匯價又起揣測，永紗開高至二三三元，四三號等雖有吸收，一七三號等則出，開後形成盤局。後以誤傳國行交換差進，一度由二三五號等賣到二二九元，二二二號等另售現信和，亦迫低至一〇九元。迨夫交換結果實屬差出，一六九號等有買，盤旋而升。永紗升至二三三元結束，收後喊價稍低，結果較上午收市計閘北華豐麗安內衣尙平，中絲小挫，景綸獨漲成半外，餘均微漲，塲外各老股略形疲軟。</p>

<p>外股昨英聯有合併之訊而獨俏，餘股因收市之先後關係，升降都有。證券帮先出後進，廣帮及洋行均扒。怡紗晨開九四〇〇〇元，聞九三五〇〇元起，盤漲至九七〇〇〇元結束。較前收計英聯獨漲半成，詳泰亦然，業廣怡　電話跌半成，紙業微升，餘均微降。</p>

<p>紗市續疲</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，續吿下挫，收市結果，四十二支四十支卅二支等細紗價比上日步降一二十萬至三四十萬元，廿支十六支粗紗則微見挺秀。</p>
<p>棉布回秀</p>
<p>棉布市氣初疲繼挺，低檔細布價較堅挺，結果能頭細布比上日回升一萬元，爲五十二萬九千元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡綢會棉紗議價，昨無變動，仍維持週一掛牌便。</p>
<p>又訊：中國紡建公司昨日循例分甲乙兩組售紗，甲組共售一七三五件，申購單一一五張。乙組共售一四九〇件，申購單共九一〇張。以上兩組共售紗三二二五件，合廿支紗四三五〇件，申購單共一〇二五張。</p>
<p>棉布轉疲</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况轉疲，同業因銀根已緊，納胃頗懈，紗廠因棉紗續挫，進意鬆弛，人心軟弱，價格不支下鴻，全日交易不旺，成交八百九十包。</p>
<h3>中信推動紗布外銷</h3>
<p>以南洋及近東一帶爲主</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局收購之到埠外棉，刻已全部交申紡建公司及民營紗廠代紡，廠方並墊出成紗約七千件，交與中信局。現中信局正會同紡建公司接洽外銷，大致以運往馬尼刺暹羅香港及近東一帶爲多，其中並有一部份係棉布云。</p>
<h3>產紗聯合配銷　民營廠難接受</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國經濟委會審查小組會修正紡調方案內，關於國營民營紗廠產紗全部發出聯合配銷一點，民營廠商方面近曾數度集議，認爲難以接受。蓋棉紗聯合配銷，過去已屢次舉辦，成績並不見佳云。</p>
<h3>證券存款利息所得　概按百分之五課稅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於第三類證券存款利息所得稅稅率改按百分之五課徵一節，已由財政部規定，自本年六月份起實行。至債券部分，應課之利息所得稅，聞亦按百分之五之稅率辦理。茲並獲悉：各種債券還本付息之課稅標準，原規定係按照各該債本息開付之日爲準。至自本年六月份起，暫改爲百分之五之稅率課徵。其意係指不論到期息票之期次遠近，概按百分之五徵收，以期簡化手續，便於計算云。</p>
<h3>食油賣風濃厚　價格一致下挫</h3>
<p>油市供求正常，賣氣濃厚，廠方不惜低價吐出市况急轉直下，豆油猛瀉四五萬元，菜油猛跌三四萬元，生油亦挫二三萬元，淸油亦然暴跌三五萬元，蔴油挫落二三萬元。</p>
<h3>人造絲略疲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午因網廠商以價過高而止辦，故極形疲軟。開槃即小。一二〇號高山有光先喊三千二百五十萬元，乏人問訊，續吿低落。中午收盤二百十萬元爲最小價，東洋爲二百五十萬元。下午因實銷戶乘價跌而稍有進胃，以致行情又見抬高。最後價復高至三百萬元，東洋三百五十萬元，結果比上日跌去三十萬元。廠經昨市平中帶軟，因連日高漲過甚，買戶俱存觀望，成交甚寥，喊價各級均無異動。綿貨昨市則略形疲軟。</p>

<h3>「基本敎育特輯」</h3>
<p>— 東方石</p>
<p>國立社會敎育學院研究部出版</p>
<p>「敎育與社會」第六卷第二三期</p>
<p>在國內關於社會敎育學術之定期刋物，爲數甚少，而國立社敎學院所編季刋「敎肓與社會」向有社會敎育界火炬之稱。此次爲配合聯合國敎育科學文化組織與中國政府協同召集在南京舉行之遠東區基本教育研究會議起見，特於該刊第六卷第二·三期編成「基本敎育特輯」，已於九月一日出版。</p>
<p>「基本敎育」這一名詞，在我國敎育界，不能目爲新奇。因爲「基本敎育」在聯敎組織所規定之宗旨爲：「在掃文肓，於較落後的國家中，促進初等敎育以及提倡民衆敎育。」而我國數十年來，在提倡新敎育的演變歷程中，早已有平民敎育。義務敎育。民衆敎育，社會敎育等各種敎育事業之推行，其性質與意義，和「基本敎育」大致相仿；自民國二十九年國民敎育施行後，將兒童敎育與民衆敎育社會敎育合流，使人民於識字之外，更培養其民族意識，生產技能，科學與衛生之常識等，這就足以表示「基本敎育」在我國，早已有積極之搖動；聯敎組織在一九四六年十一月舉行第一屆大會於巴黎時，決定第一次基本敎育分區研究會，在中國首都——南京舉行，也因認爲中國是近代推廣敎育的先驅之故。惟我國地大民貧，並以近百年來的天災人過，循環相尋，迄無止境，雖經孫中山先生間導國民革命，力求改善人民生活，惟直至今日，仍不免有半數以上的人民，輾轉於貧，弱，愚，私的窘境中，度其可憐的生活。故在今日來研究討論「基本敎育」，無論其爲現時代「世界敎育的新思潮」也罷，「中國原已有之」也罷，總仍不失其重要性，而値得全國注意的一件事。</p>
<p>該列首列陳禮江之「我對於基本敎育的信念」一文，將敎育文化因經濟制度的反映，而顯示其作用，說得非當深刻而明析。並希望因基本敎育的力量，使各國人民訓煉成純正的世界公民，創立新的敎育哲學觀念，眞是確切不易之論。接着張治安先生之「社會敎育與世界和平」，提出建立肚界和平爲原則的敎育改造途徑，確是値得世界人士，重新估定敎育價値的猛省。</p>
<p>我國推行民敎，義敎，社敎，以及國敎，甚至立即又爲此次標出之基本敎育而努力，祗恐仍萬不免重蹈幾十年來之覆轍——文向旣隨掃隨盲，知育將永遠和原子研究的進步，保持着長遠的距離。某原因所在，全由於政治經濟之限制。這一點的抉出，古楳先生之「基本敎育的基本問題」一文中，確有其獨到的見解。所惋惜者，在刧後山河，千瘡百孔的今日，這所謂基本問題，恐怕仍不容易解決呢！</p>
<p>世界各國各民族間，都有其不同之社會情况與歷史背景，我國旣已由於幾千年來的封建意識，根深蒂固於民族傳統的生活習慣中；更因淸政不修，致爲列强環攻之的而淪於次殖民地的厄運，使人民跌落在政治圈外；迄於今日，仍是一個無科學，無建設，甚至無生產工具，無生產技術的國家，人民生活，老在死亡綫的邊緣上掙扎。於如此情况之下，推行基本敎育，是不是應有特別的着眼點與着手處？董渭川先生之「基本敎育在中國特具的意義」一文，非特絕無顧忌地列舉其癥結，且明確地指示了中國推行基本敎育必取之途徑。</p>
<p>舒新城先生對中國文化事業之建設，貢獻甚多；汪畏之光生本其工作不懈，克苦創造的毅力，主持着社敎院之電敎系。今該刋中有舒作之「在基本敎育中推行電化敎育的計劃」，汪作之「識字敎育影片的理諭和我們的攝製」二文。俱對於基本敎育的新工具——感覺輔助敎具，包括電影與播言，——的使用，在敎育上有確切的估價。前者就中國實際環境而擬具了詳盡的計劃，後者以研究實騐的精神而有所創製，俱足以供推行基敎之參考與採擇。</p>
<p>餘如該院國民敎育實騐區與社會敎育實騐區的兩篇工作報吿，非特可作招待基敎會議代表前往參觀時之說明，且可供一般基本敎育實施時之參考。顧嶽中先生之「戰後各國基本敎育烏瞰」，也有足資我國借　之處。</p>
<h3>怎樣做小先生</h3>
<p>— 高寗</p>
<p>（陶行知著，商務印書館出版，全書三十五頁，定價一五〇〇元。）</p>
<p>杜咸敎育理論家陶行知先化，無論其信仰如何，對於中國敎育界，總還有　功績，朱經　先生爲其生前好友，據　者所知，亦對其敎育理論，十分推崇。</p>
<p>陶氏於敎育貧窮子弟時，採用小先生制，這本「怎樣做小先生」，即爲做小先生的指導法——新敎育之實施方案。</p>
<p>本書內容包括：（一）爲什麼要做小先生，（二）找學生，（二）課本要不要？（四）識字呢讀字呢？（五）活動材料，（六）留聲機與無綫電，（七）圖　　　之功用，（八）知道什麼敎什麼，（九）敎人的時間，（十）不要擺架子，（十一）虛心求學，（十二）敎你的學生也做小先生，（十三）小先生團，（十四）一變二，（十五）釘住你的學生，也讓你的學生釘住你。</p>
<p>這十五個步驟，是做小先生的必循步驟，在今日中國敎育不普及的今天，小先生制至少對於掃除文盲是可以參考的。我相信，因此可以解決普及敎育上的問題不少。</p>
<p>當現在大家正在討論如何推行基本敎育的時候，我們提出這本書來，作爲發展　敎的一種工且書。</p>
<p>我希望每個年輕朋友均一讀此書，然後酌量實行普及敎育之任務，則中國人民之辛福無窮。</p>
<h3>中國立體地形圖</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>（史地圖表編　社　）</p>
<p>（亞光輿地學社出版）</p>
<p>（三十六年六月初版）</p>
<p>現在我介紹給讀者一幅立體地形圖。關於我國地形圖的繪製，過去都是平面的，雖然平面地形圖也能表明地勢的高低，但是對全國地形仍不能給閣圖者澈底的明白，因此遂有立體地形圖的繪製。</p>
<p>現今我國出版之立體地形圖，據筆者所知有二種：第一種是申報館出版翁文灝，丁文江，曾世英三先生所編中國分省新圖之立體地形圖，其乖直比例尺約爲平面比例尺之十五倍。第二種爲亞光輿地學社出版中國史地圖表編　社主編之大中國立體地形圖，其比例尺爲六百三十萬分之一</p>
<p>申報出版之中國分省新圖，開風氣之先；至於「大中國立體地形圖」圖幅較大，便於縣掛，也許是他的優點。</p>
<p>東北九省政治區域最近又重劃分了，對於點重劃分之東北九省，想必是閱圖者所亟欲知道的；而本圖已根據國民政府所公佈的界綫，把它改繪。</p>
<p>此圖的下角附有斯圖的概說，將全國之地形特色也表白無遺，並將全國地形綜合爲四大部份，每部份並分爲若干副區計：（一）西藏高原，（二）蒙新高原，（三）大高原鄰近地帶又分爲五區，興安山地，山陝高原，中央山地，四川盆地，及雲出高原。（四）低邱陵地與平原，又分爲九區；東北大平原，長白邱陵地，華北大平原，山東邱陵地，長江平原，江南邱陵地，東南　　邱陵地，　　盆地，及台湾與海南島。</p>
<p>是圖　經編者精心　劃，　難免尙有疏漏之處，今就　管見所得約有二點：</p>
<p>一，敍昆，滇緬，基江，成　，海南島，開封小　　諸鐵這未曾表明。</p>
<p>二，川滇交界處省界遺　。（王邦珍著。商務版）</p>
<h3>近代幾何學　（王邦珍著·商務版）</h3>
<p>— 蕭成基</p>
<p>幾何學一科，在古代希臘時已十分發達，但到第五世紀後，一直沒有很大的進展，至十九世紀中，近世幾何學勃興，許多奇巧優美的定理，先後出現；異葩怒茁，極一時之盛，許多中學生們對此都很感興趣，却往往苦於得不到適當的書籍，以供研究，國內關於近世幾何學的書，雖有可數的幾本，但大多不能適合我國學生的程度和興趣，自從見到王邦珍氏的這本書，我好像在沙漠中發現一座樂園！</p>
<p>此書說理力求淺顯，只要習完一部初級幾何學的人，即能閱續，全書共分十一編：一，平均中心，二，三角形，三·共點共綫性，四·調和分割，五·極點極綫，六·相似中心，七，共軸圓及直交圓，八·反形，九·非調和比，十·雙對原理，十一·最近之三角形幾何學，僅以一百六十多頁的篇幅，將近世幾何學的全部內容簡括地陳述出來，使讀者以最少的精力，而得到一個完整淸晣的概觀，讀完這本書，再去看其他較高深的幾何學書，可以左右逢源，毫無困難了。</p>
<p>這本書是以Godfrey＆Sid　dous　Modern　Geometry一書爲藍本，二氏的原書，在英國風行極廣，而王邦珍氏的畫更有遠勝於前者的地方：他搜羅了許多名題（例如：Talbot定理及Malfetti問題）都是非常奇妙，而爲一般書上所不載的。</p>
<p>此外書中所附的圖形，也很精美，不似一般印製粗陋的書，一見就令人倒胃口。</p>
<p>對於在幾何學上已很有興趣，却找不到合宜書籍的人，我願意將這本書鄭重地介紹給他們。</p>

<h3>洪門志</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林　朱琳編　中華書局出版</p>
<p>平裝卅二開本一冊　定價四元</p>
<p>帮會的組織，一向是秘密的。他們的會衆對於機構的內容，大家都必嚴守秘密，要是有會衆向外間洩漏，便要受最嚴厲的處分，（在十禁之中第五禁，有：自人洪門之後，對於會中章程，不得私與外人，如犯之者，處死刑。在廿一則中第六則：私以儀式書，及會員之憑證，示與外人者，刵兩耳，加笞刑一百八。第八則：會中事件，報吿於外人者，則兩耳，加答刑七十二。）所以他們都嚴守機密。民國元年，商務印書館出版平山周的「中國祕密社會史，」是把白建會，夭地會，三合會，哥老會，興中會及同盟會，光復公會等，合編成書，雖然他的材料不完不備，可是一向視做祕密的帮會內容，首次公開了。廿四年，蕭于山編印的「近代秘密社會史料」，圖文較多，內容也豐當。去年，衛大法師著作「中國的帮會」，寫來也很詳細，其他關於帮會的也有好幾種，而內容是大同小異。</p>
<p>朱琳的洪門志，開於洪門的內容，尤其是對於隱語，暗號，應用俗語，入會手續，各種考錄，開山儀式，香堂秩序，令詞，條語分類等的資料，比較詳盡。使人研究洪門各種儀式隱語的，都能够詳明。而且從那些令語中，可以知道他們的思想，這是研究秘密帮會的實際資料，同時反映出當時他們之所以編撰這些令詞與隱語的深心，是別有見解，而超出當時一般士大夫的思想行動。</p>
<p>惟本書有一最大的缺點，就是他在引證興中會的革命運動與洪門開係的材料，著者對於國民黨歷史，似乎很隔膜，如他所說國父「世居南洋爪哇，奉基督敎」。這是違背　實的，所謂世居爪哇，固無根據，即奉基督敎，也是由國父起，國父的大哥德彰，也非敎徒。國父在民國八年，在舊金山着手改組致公堂，重訂章程。而本書著者所說乃在「檀香山遇有三合會首領鄭士良引進入會，改組致公堂創立興中會，……遂遣派會員鄭弼臣，陸皓東，陳少白，陳宗桂，楊飛洪，……等至各地結合同志，遍訪英豪……」，與事實相反。鄭士良是國　在廣州博濟醫院習醫時的同學，弼臣是士良的號。楊飛洪（鴻）即楊權雲，在香港與國父相識。陸皓車早於光緒廿一年乙未殉國，楊衢雲也在光緒廿六年庚子惠州之役之後在香港遭淸吏的奸細暗殺，怎能參加民國前八年改組織致公堂的工作呢。而且鄭弼臣，陸皓東，楊衢雲等又沒有到過檀香山，興中會首次舉義，是在光緒廿一年乙未，地點是廣州，並不是惠州。此役殉難的是陸皓東，朱桂銓，丘四等三人，程耀臣被捕死在大有倉，其他被捕的六十多人，一律被指爲愚民被惑，分別遣散。而本書著者說是會員陳宗桂，李亞舉，楊飛洪，有香山等殉難，不知有何根據。（按陸皓東名中桂，而本畫著者說爲陳宗桂，不知是一是二）</p>
<p>關於興中會章程，不採用檀香山最初組織的章程，而用香港興中會章程，亦不註明，不知何故？而在舊金山致公堂重訂新章，他的要議和條款，是致公堂改組後的重要文　，是國父　自撰擬的。本書竟把他漏去，沒有收入，未免美中不足。</p>
<p>本書如果能够把國民黨的前身興中會，同盟會與洪門相結合的史實，重新編著加入，是一本比較的洪門志的精詳的史料，特爲提出，希望此書著者和讀者注意，幷知道此書錯漏的地方。</p>

<h3>晴霞孤寡貧病救濟金　金華豐君慨捐五百萬元　本欄敬代表數苦難同胞致敬意</h3>
<p>昨天我們收到讀者金華聲君來信並附來法幣五百萬元，他信中說：「貴報舉辦晴霞救濟會，嘉惠貧病，誠非淺鮮。鄙人服務商界，難不足稱富有，但生活尙能溫飽，目睹無數苦難同胞，願連無告豈能坐視？爰將節約所得之五百萬元，全部捐作晴霞救濟會，救濟苦難同胞，尙祈撿收爲荷」。對於金君的義舉，我們表示衷心的銘感，同時也爲無數正在困厄的環境中掙扎的同胞慶幸。　晴霞救濟會從去年到現在，前後已經頒發了十五次，由於幣値的變遷，發出的金額一次比一次的增加，同時申請的人也逐漸加多，所以每一次還有不少的人感到失望，當然我們也有難言的苦衷，希望熱心人士，給予我們更多的不斷的協助。</p>

<h3>王丹鳳小姐　花袖外穿新裝</h3>
<p>— 馮秋萍</p>
<p>一般背心，不求袖口方面之考究，往往失却美觀性，這件背心的構結，心裁別出，袖口兩緣，鑲以花邊，不失全衣之平衡，而束腰之摺疊，更見細腰若柳，因而下擺展開，飄飄欲仙，風姿動人。用白紅直條相格，姣　醒目，無論襯衫上旗袍上，均爲少女理想中之外衣！</p>
<p>材料</p>
<p>皇后牌細羢紅色四支，淡色四支。</p>
<p>起首</p>
<p>從前身右襟，橫結起一二〇針，九行平針，用淡色結之，再換紅色結五行，來去平針，每隔二行放一針，領圈半圓形，肩上有三寸半闊，平結一寸長，收口左襟相同。後身</p>
<p>後身</p>
<p>從下擺到掛肩，橫結為八八針，平結紅二行，淡色九行，再放掛肩，每隔一行，放一針，放到五針，平結四寸，背闊十七條，在左面掛肩，每隔一行，收一針。收去五針，平結紅色二行，淡色九行，回原爲八八針。在一行上收口，與前身縫合之。四週鈎長三針一行，用紅色綫鈎之。領圈用淡色鈎木耳　一行</p>

<p>王丹鳳的羢綫新裝</p>
<h3>羢綫與編結之關係</h3>
<p>— 馮秋萍</p>
<p>羢綫一物，始仰給歐西，因其能推陳出新，國人靡不樂用。</p>
<p>國人監於歷年漏扈數宇駕人，爲挽同利權，創銷國產品，以資與舶來品，一決雌雄，紛起投資，自行設廠，不惜集中財力物力人力之三大原則下，慘淡經營，精益求精，迄至今日，已巍巍然躍居爲世界絨綫業之首席，其成功不是偶然的。</p>
<p>方其時也，編結藝術尙屬龜步牛行，故步自封；秋萍不才，引見編結製物之需要日廣，提倡不遺餘力，創辦編結學校，以選拔新人，主輯編結書　，或敎授於空氣之中，披露報端，傾知　人，以供同好。十餘年來，孜孜不倦、深蒙社會仕女，一致愛載，實不勝汗顏。歷屆畢業員生，不下盈千，幾遍全滬。此固國人愛用國貨之先知性使然，而編結與羢綫之關係，兩者似乎互相關繫，有異曲同工之妙，其焦點在斯矣。</p>
<p>比年來，編結藝術，日新月異，迎合時代，舉凡仁女時裝大衣旗袍以及小孩童裝，在在普遍選用，因此國產羢綫，亦暢銷全國，供不應求，此不得不歸功於編結藝術之發達，有以致之耳。</p>
<p>而編結藝術，又在不斷長進中，値茲國家動員，節約羢綫本質，合乎節約的條件，故未來坦途，正未可限量也，</p>
<p>言　珠的絨線外套</p>
<p>歐陽莎菲　絨繞新裝</p>
<p>這件原子花披肩背心，是一九四八年式的第一件的新作品，對於詳細編結方法及說明，請參閱即將出版的秋洋女士所編的「結法特刋」。該刋各大絨綫商店普遍贈送，以供愛好編結者之語。請各界特別注意。</p>
<h3>李慧芳的羢線新裝　李慧芳小姐　大襟如意　花棉襖</h3>
<p>— 陳鴻燕</p>
<p>時代的巨浪，永遠向前進展展着。去年上海曾流行着一種短棉襖，成爲時髦仕女唯一的裝飾品。我們編結界站在時代的最前綫，所以爲發揚藝術，不敢後人，不斷研究，已將絨綫改製成功了。看岡中曲綫與輪廓，分劃出多麼明顯。如意的花紋，鑲嵌出美艷的圖案，古色古香，十足表現出大方別緻的條件。而且禦寒性特强，實爲愛美仕女理想之羢綫棉襖。</p>
<p>前身</p>
<p>起首一百廿四針，收腰法與後身相同。大襟收法，照旗袍開，圓領圈左面先放，袖子半片結長同後身相齊，用刺綉針縫合之。見十三至十六合訂本第八六頁。</p>
<p>袖管橫結先結五針，第二行一行上，加添六針，第三行加七針，第四加八針，依次而推。加針共有九十針，結長六寸，照放的針數收針，收到五針爲止，將袖管縫合接上，第二只相同。</p>

<h3>Recovery of Lu’an and Huangmei in Anhui and Hubei Provinces; Annihilation War Unfolds at Hongze Lake; Lu Troops Advance Towards Zhaoyuan and Laiyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 17th] The National Army recovered Lu’an, an important town in western Anhui, at 8 a.m. on the 17th. The bandits fled towards Sujiabu and Huoshan, and are being pursued. National Army troops in the city are pacifying refugees and restoring order. Lu’an had been occupied by the bandits for exactly two weeks. Nanfenlukou, 70 li southwest of Hefei, has also been recovered, and the remaining bandits are being cleared in the Xijiaopodian area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 17th] Strong units of the National Army launched an attack on Lu’an on the 16th. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to hold and fled towards Huoshan. Lu’an was recovered on the morning of the 17th. National Army troops entered the city to investigate the results of the battle and dispatched a team to pursue the bandits towards Huoshan. The county seat is expected to be captured soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 17th] (1) The Sixth Column of bandits fleeing towards Huangmei once attempted to invade the county seat.

(2) According to reports, the bandit Independent Column plans to establish a guerrilla zone in Zhutangdian, south of Xinyang and Luoshan, and another guerrilla zone in Lishan and the Dajilong and Xiaojilong Mountains. National Army troops are deploying closely to pursue and annihilate them.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] A spokesman for the Army Headquarters stated: The Associated Press reported on the 14th that the bandit Liu Bocheng’s troops seized 150,000 Japanese-surrendered rifles and a large amount of ammunition from the Lu’an arsenal in western Anhui last week. This is completely fabricated. At that time, the Japanese troops (in western and central Anhui) were all designated to proceed to the areas along the Jinghu Railway to surrender. There is no reason why a large amount of weaponry and ammunition would be stored in this remote mountainous area.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense on the 17th denied rumors that the Communist army had politically captured Anqing and Hukou, and also denied the report that Liu Bocheng’s troops had increased from 25,000 to 80,000. The spokesman stated: Currently, Liu’s troops number slightly more than 20,000.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 17th] The reorganized 63rd Division today hosted the Wuhu press. Division Commander Lin Zhan stated: (1) Liu Bocheng's bandit troops are disturbing western and central Anhui and are temporarily occupying the Dabie Mountains. They will eventually be annihilated because they lack ammunition. (2) The Yangtze River defense is divided into sections for guard. It is impossible for large groups of Liu’s bandits to cross the river. Even if small groups sneak across, they can definitely be annihilated. (3) There is no need to worry about the defenses of Wuhu and areas to the west. [Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 17th] The annihilation war at Hongze Lake has begun. The lakeside area is now under the control of strong National Army forces.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 17th] Liu Bocheng's bandits have retreated to the foothills of the Dabie Mountains. His First and Seventh Columns have been broken up into smaller units, and only a small part of his Sixth Column, numbering about 1,000, has fled to Huanghai. The main force is only in the Hejiadian area north of Guangji. A portion of the bandits in western Henan are fleeing west along the railway, and another portion is fleeing southwest from Lushi Zhuyangzhen. Currently, the bandits in western Henan are echoing the bandits who have come south from the Jin-Shaanxi border region. The focus of the war situation has shifted west.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Yanzhou, 17th] The fighting in the Yuncheng area of southwestern Shandong is still stalemated. In the Jiaodong area, after the highway from Yexian through Dianzi, Pingdu, Gugang, Liuzhuang, and Lingshan to Jimo Qingdao was opened, the National Army, in addition to clearing out scattered bandits on both sides of the highway, continued to advance towards Zhaoyuan and Laiyang. The National Navy and Air Force have been assisting ground troops in attacking bandit positions in various ports of the Shandong Peninsula for days, achieving repeated successes. It is rumored that the National Army...</p>

<h3>"September 18th"! The Northeast is as Cold as Early Winter; People are Filled with Emotions; Ma Zhanshan Hopes for Unity to Suppress the Rebellion and Build National Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 17th] No decision has been made here regarding commemorative activities for "September 18th." However, with yellow leaves falling and autumn colors pervading, the end of autumn is near. Northeasterners are filled with emotion whenever they mention "September 18th." Although Shenyang is full of vitality, there is hope for sweeping changes throughout the Northeast. When asked, the elders of the Northeast said that Shenyang is now the rear area. They hope that the recovered areas and the unrecovered areas, as well as the entire Northeast, can be rescued within a time limit, especially the people trapped in the bandit areas who are hoping for this the most.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] There was heavy rain in Shenyang on the night of the 16th, and the 17th was as cold as early winter, with temperatures dropping to 60 degrees. Pedestrians huddled on the streets. On "September 18th," there were military exercises by the city defense troops, including infantry and artillery. Newspapers published articles commemorating the event, and the people were quietly filled with emotions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] On the eve of "September 18th," Ma Zhanshan told reporters: The Northeast has been recovered for two years, but in the past two years, the country has been riddled with problems, and its status has declined daily, while Japan has been steadily improving. The only way forward is to unite to suppress the rebellion and prevent Japan from returning in ten years. At the same time, we should seize the foundation of industry and mining and build national defense, warning ambitious countries not to think of interfering, otherwise they will be taught a lesson.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] Zheng Dongguo's thoughts on "September 18th": The current situation in the Northeast is more serious than it was then, and we must be more vigilant. We must do our best to suppress the rebellion and eliminate the bandits. The enemy has not openly provided assistance to the Communist bandits. The so-called Sixth Offensive may be launched at the end of the month or the beginning of next month, but there is no need to worry.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff Chen Cheng Issues a Letter to the Military and Civilians of the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] On the 16th anniversary of "September 18th," Chief of Staff and Director of the Northeast Xingyuan Chen Cheng issued a special letter to all military and civilians in the Northeast, explaining how to prevent a second "September 18th" from happening. The letter stated: The "September 18th" Incident was the beginning of Japan's invasion of China and the root cause of the outbreak of World War II. Since then, the Northeast has been occupied and ravaged by Japan, but Japan has also swallowed this bomb from that time and eventually suffered the consequences. Therefore, the Northeast's "September 18th" has a special historical significance, whether from the perspective of China, Japan, or the entire world, and is worthy of painful commemoration. Finally, Chen specifically warned all military and civilians in the Northeast that although the shameful deeds of "September 18th" have become a thing of the past, the terrible crisis in the Northeast has not diminished due to Japan's defeat. The "September 18th" Monument is still erected on Beiling Road, which is worthy of our vigilance. Everyone is in this dangerous situation and must guard their posts, focus on their jobs, give up personal temporary interests, and prioritize the permanent interests of the nation, striving to eliminate special treatment and bring everything back to normal. Only in this way can we weather the storm together and overcome difficulties.</p>

<h3>Dong Xian Guang Speaks on the Position on the Japanese Peace Conference at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>Personnel from the Resources Commission Studying in the United States to Return Home Immediately</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Government Information Office of the Executive Yuan hosted a press conference in the afternoon of the 17th, presided over by Dong Xian Guang, who answered the question of "What is China's position on the Japanese peace treaty? If the Soviet Union does not attend the eleven-nation conference, will China attend?" He stated: The Chinese government's attitude towards the US government's convening of the Japanese peace conference has been fully clarified by Foreign Minister Wang before his trip to the United States on the 5th of this month. Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, the Chinese government has consistently maintained that a satisfactory and definitive result cannot be obtained without the unanimous support of the countries concerned. If any major power alone concludes a peace treaty with Japan, we will not be able to resolve the major issues arising from the Pacific and Far East wars, and the purpose of the treaty will be defeated. The Chinese government hopes that its efforts to promote the participation of all relevant governments in the Japanese peace conference will bear fruit in the early conclusion of a treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Director Dong of the Government Information Office stated at a press conference today that it was reported last week that someone suggested that China's dispatch of personnel abroad consumes a large amount of foreign exchange each year, and that this fund could be used to improve domestic universities, and mentioned that there are currently 400 employees of the Resources Commission interning in the United States. According to the person in charge of the Resources Commission, the commission sent a group of outstanding personnel in various industries to the United States for internships during and after the war, mainly those interning under the Lend-Lease Act, who were handled according to the government's general plan. In addition, there were also designers of the Three Gorges Project and those participating in internships at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, with a total number of about 400 people. In early May of this year, in view of the urgent need for technical personnel for domestic restoration and the tight national foreign exchange situation, the commission formulated detailed measures and telegraphed all interns to return home within a time limit. The design work of the Three Gorges project was ordered to be stopped, so all personnel have also returned home. Currently, about 250 people have returned home and are participating in the restoration work in the recovered areas. Another 60 people are waiting for ships to return home. Currently, there are only about 90 people still interning in the United States, including more than 50 Westinghouse company interns and 40 Lend-Lease Act interns who were ordered to assist in wartime production and delayed their departure. The above personnel will return home as soon as their internship period expires.</p>

<h3>Chen Guangfu's Written Speech at the Foreign Trade Conference; Hoping for Cooperation between Industry and Commerce to Conserve, Increase Production, and Promote Exports</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, delivered a written speech at yesterday's National Foreign Trade Conference (for details of the conference, please see page 7) as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants in the Past Did Not Understand Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Since China opened to trade with foreign countries, it has always been in an unfavorable position in foreign trade. Except for the occasional year or two of surplus, there has always been an excess of imports over exports, sometimes tens of millions of yuan, sometimes four or five hundred million yuan. Fortunately, we still have a very important intangible income, that is, remittances from overseas Chinese, which offset a large part of the excess imports. Speaking of our exports, we still rely on foreigners' promotion. For example, soybeans were able to be exported in large quantities after the Japanese used various convenient methods in the Northeast and promoted and publicized them abroad. Another example is tung oil and pig bristles. Chinese merchants mostly only transport them to Hankou and Shanghai. As for how to transport them out, how to promote them, and how to standardize the quality, foreign firms have been devising methods. At that time, Chinese merchants rarely understood the foreign market and promotion situation, so they rarely could export directly themselves.</p>
<p>Developing Foreign Trade, Paying Attention to Agricultural Product Processing</p>
<p>Everyone generally says that industry is important, and this is certainly true, but trade is even more important. Because whether it is domestic trade or foreign trade, this kind of "exchanging what you have for what you don't have" can achieve the effect of "making the most of everything" so that "goods are not abandoned on the ground." In other words, it is "exchanging what you have for what you don't have," which is the highest utility in economic principles. For example, our tung oil and pig bristles cannot be consumed so much in the country. If they are not transported out, they become waste. If we export them and exchange them for machines, wouldn't our industrial goals be partly built through trade? Moreover, we are now an agricultural country. Exports are all agricultural products, and the export of these agricultural products all requires separate processing in order to make trade more developed. Therefore, when we build industries, we should first focus on the processing industries of agricultural products. All of the above words seem to have not much to do with the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee, but in fact they are necessary conditions for seeking foreign exchange balance. The work of the Balance Committee is now based on income and expenditure for foreign exchange. If we can find ways to promote foreign trade, our foreign exchange income will naturally increase, and we can use this income to build industries and purchase machines. Wouldn't the construction of our industries be successfully built from trade? So I say that trade is even more important than industry.</p>
<p>Hoping that Foreign Exchange Income Can Gradually Increase</p>
<p>Now, the general public seems to be very concerned about the Balance Committee, but does not pay much attention to using this opportunity to promote trade. Today, your committee is discussing foreign trade issues, and it has truly grasped the core of the current issue. You are either businessmen from friendly countries coming to China for business, or commercial leaders from various places. We are confident that after the meeting, you will definitely cooperate with each other and use this opportunity to give full play to the effectiveness of our Chinese foreign trade. This is worthy of admiration, especially the Balance Committee is more concerned about future foreign trade, and hopes that foreign exchange income can gradually increase so that both imports and exports can meet our needs. As for the black market problem, under the management of trade, unless there is comprehensive control, the black market is bound to arise. For example, there is a black market for train tickets and boat tickets, and there is also a black market for theater tickets. There are black markets in many, many aspects, and not only China has them, but all countries have black markets. I can say that the day we cannot open free trade and cannot provide unlimited foreign exchange, the black market will always be unavoidable, but the existence of the black market does not necessarily fundamentally harm the legitimate market. Now our foreign exchange is acting rationally according to the actual situation at any time, and it can be hoped that exports can be promoted and overseas Chinese remittances will not be leaked.

Whether he can be the chairman of the election office in the Japanese region should be clarified. Resolution: The provisions of the original method are for ordinary people who voluntarily transfer their nationality. The nationality of the people of Taiwan Province is due to the loss and restoration of the territory, and is not comparable to those who voluntarily transfer their nationality. Therefore, it is not restricted by the above-mentioned legal provisions and should have the right to vote and be elected. Huang Tingfu can also still be the chairman of the election office in the Japanese region.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Xu Fulin, a key member of the Democratic Socialist Party and current government commissioner, told reporters on the 17th that although the party's nominations for participation in the national general election have been agreed upon within the party, they have not yet been submitted to the government because the proportional distribution problem jointly negotiated by the three parties has not yet been decided. The government wants the two parties to submit the list, but the two parties hope that the government will finalize the proportion, so the party's list cannot be submitted first when no results have been obtained in principle.</p>

<h3>Reduction and Exemption of Farmland Tax Due to Disaster: Standards Stipulated by the Ministry of Food</h3>
<p>No Reduction or Exemption for Harvests of 60% or More</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Food said: "The determination of the percentage of disaster reduction and exemption is based on the total amount of harvest in a normal year in the disaster-stricken land. Those with a harvest of less than 20% will be exempted from all taxes, those with a harvest of 20% or more but less than 30% will be reduced or exempted from 80% of farmland tax, those with a harvest of 30% or more but less than 40% will be reduced or exempted from 70%, those with a harvest of 40% or more but less than 50% will be reduced or exempted from 60%, and those with a harvest of 50% or more but less than 60% will be reduced or exempted from 50%. No reduction or exemption will be granted for harvests in the middle range of 60% or more." The decision on the reduction and exemption standards is based on the reports of farmers in the disaster-stricken areas. The county government, together with the Farmland and Food Department or the Farmland Management Agency, dispatches personnel for preliminary investigation. The provincial government supervises the Civil Affairs Department (or the Land Administration Bureau in provinces with a Land Administration Bureau), Finance Department, and Farmland and Food Department to dispatch personnel for re-investigation. The provincial government, based on the serious disaster situation, reports those in areas in dire need of relief to the central competent relief agency for verification and handling. According to the Ministry of Social Affairs: Disaster relief lies in being swift and timely. Therefore, at the beginning of disasters in various places, appropriate relief is given based on reports from various places or direct investigations, and it is not based on the figures of tax reduction and exemption.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] According to news from the Ministry of Education: Regarding the relief and guidance work for out-of-school and unemployed youth who have fled from bandit areas, the Ministry has established a Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Guidance Committee to preside over the matter. The Committee has established youth guidance offices and secondary school refresher classes, vocational training classes, and teacher training institutes in provinces and cities such as North China, Northeast China, and Jiangsu. There are more than 50 guidance and training institutions that specialize in receiving youth who have fled from bandit areas, providing them with remedial education or simple vocational training, and then assisting them in returning to school or finding employment. In the past two years, the Committee has provided relief and guidance to 209,256 people in 1946 and 266,315 people in the first half of this year. However, since the expansion of the communist rebellion, the number of youth fleeing from bandit areas has been increasing daily. There are now no less than 800,000 people in urgent need of relief in various places.

<h3>Chen Guangfu's Written Statement: Continued from Page One; Must Be Frugal and Economical; Increase Production and Promote Exports</h3>
<p>The present is a transitional period. We lack US dollars, just like all countries in the world, so we cannot but save money. Take the United Kingdom as an example. It has a four-hundred-year history of trade surplus, and it is also a leader in economics, currency, and shipping. However, since the two world wars, the difficulties have been "deep". After the First World War, the gold standard was abolished, and this time the exchange of US dollars was suspended. The government and the public are living a hard life with a firm spirit, practicing economy, and trying to increase exports. Their spirit can be emulated by us. The lives of our ordinary people are so low that they cannot be lower. Now the promotion of economy is to be practiced by those of us who come here to attend meetings and some of the richer people who live in Shanghai. In the future, we will strictly practice economy, and at the same time, everyone will work hard to increase production, promote exports, work together with one heart, live within our means, and rely on our own efforts to overcome this difficult stage. Mr. Hu Puan said in his book "The Cultivation of Confucianism" that we should eat simply, so that we can reduce desires. If desires are reduced, various improper events of greed for wealth can be reduced. This is the spirit of Confucianism combined with Buddhism. For thousands of years, our China has been governing the family with simplicity. Our Chinese living situation cannot now follow the example of the industrially developed United States. If we want to imitate the living standards of Americans, we will have to wait until our industry is also developed. Otherwise, our national strength will be invisibly consumed in this desire for enjoyment, and it will be difficult to recover. Recently, everyone advocates self-reliance, which is the philosophy of self-reliance.</p>
<p>This new foreign exchange method is just a measure during the transitional period. I was recommended by the Central Bank to preside over it, and the regulations are still being approved. The advantages of the new method were mentioned by Mr. Zhang Yujiu at the meeting the day before yesterday: "Because the foreign exchange rate maintained a 'pegged' policy in the past, it was difficult to maintain exports after several price changes. The new method was promulgated in August, changing the past 'pegged' official price to a flexible market price." Successive price changes are all aimed at promoting exports. The pegged rate is not intended to maintain stability, but in fact it cannot be achieved as expected. Therefore, the flexible rate is adopted, which is to make it possible for China to promote exports. Recently, our foreign exchange revenue and expenditure situation has improved, and the imbalance has been reduced by 50% compared with before. These are all enlightened measures taken by our government authorities, as well as realistic plans implemented by the Central Bank under the leadership of Mr. Zhang Gongquan, and the results of the day and night review of many people in the event. I am in my twilight years and reluctantly take on this matter, and I am ashamed that I have made no contribution.</p>
<p>How to Eradicate the Black Market Depends on the Cooperation of the Government and the Public</p>
<p>Speaking of eliminating the black market, the most important thing is to rely on economic means, that is, to reduce demand. Whether demand can be reduced is a difficult question. If everyone does not ask the black market to buy foreign exchange, then no one needs black market foreign exchange, and it will naturally not rise. If the black market does not rise, then domestic prices will stabilize, and the cost of export goods will naturally not increase. Whoever only cares about private affairs and disregards the public, and strives to satisfy his own desires by asking the black market to obtain foreign exchange, and only seeks his own convenience, the harm to the public and the impact on various economic problems are indescribable. Therefore, it is hoped that whether a policy can be effective depends entirely on whether the people of the country can fully cooperate, which is the most important thing. Therefore, it is hoped that after the meeting, everyone will go back and lead the industrial and commercial circles to cooperate together to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Painful Memories and Bright Prospects</h3>
<p>The arrival of the "September 18th Incident" will inevitably evoke painful memories in every Chinese person. These memories are multifaceted, recalling the various encounters of the past sixteen years: the decline and demise of Japanese imperialism, the victorious completion of the Chinese nation's historical struggle, and the evolution of various international relations over these sixteen years. Faced with the current situation of China and the world, as the anniversary arrives, learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, we cannot but be vigilant.</p>
<p>We must first point out that we are a nation with a rich historical consciousness. For two thousand years, we have been immersed in Confucian traditions, and we are not a nation that values emotions alone, but one that values both emotions and reason. In terms of emotions, we do not wish to emphasize the recounting of our painful experiences. Today, the Japanese militarists have collapsed, and Japan is undergoing a rebirth, moving towards the path of democracy. After this painful experience, the Chinese and Japanese nations should be able to cooperate closely from now on. There should be no more growth of seeds of jealousy between the peoples. In this sense, we hope that the Japanese people can truly encounter a new life and move towards the path of democracy after the collapse of the militarists. Precisely because of this, we cannot help but harbor considerable anxiety about the recent news from Japan. The continued existence of conservative and even reactionary forces, the remnants of feudalism and even militarism, are now disguised in democratic garb and openly disseminated. All of this may be due to the tolerance of the occupying authorities, but in reality, it may not necessarily be beneficial to the Japanese people. On the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," we must raise this point to urge the attention of the occupying authorities and the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Of course, the "September 18th Incident" reminds us of the impotence of the League of Nations at the time, which ultimately led humanity to the calamity of World War II. The Chinese people, feeling the impotence of the League of Nations, had long yearned for the emergence of a strong international organization. Therefore, the Chinese people place ardent expectations and sincere support on the United Nations, which was born from the blood shed in World War II. All of humanity around the world must ensure that this international organization can fully exercise its powers in order to ensure world peace. Within our scope, due to our own painful experiences, our sincere support for this United Nations organization goes without saying. However, unfortunately, since the establishment of this international organization, all of its activities have not necessarily lived up to the ideals of the world. We cannot say that any country has a conspiracy to destroy this organization. The reason why it has not lived up to our ideals is just like a newborn baby being prone to diseases. We must take good care of it so that the baby can grow and develop into adulthood.</p>
<p>Today, we commemorate the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," already in the third year after our victory in the War of Resistance, and the situation in the Northeast has not yet returned to normal, which inevitably evokes many emotions in us. We deeply know that the development of the situation in the Northeast and even the entire post-war China has both internal and external factors at play. In terms of the internal aspect, this is obviously due to the rebellion of the communist bandits. Therefore, today, as we commemorate this painful day, we must devote all our efforts to complete our suppression of the rebellion in the shortest possible time. After the bandit rebellion is suppressed, the situation in the Northeast will not be difficult to return to normal quickly. In terms of the external aspect, the development of the post-war situation in China to the current stage is mainly due to the lack of a clear and firm policy from Washington. Vice President Sun pointed out when he met with reporters from the Associated Press yesterday that the United States' Far East policy is not firm enough and is too vague. As a result, on the one hand, it has created the arrogance of the communist bandits today, and on the other hand, it has aroused the suspicion of the Soviet Union, thus affecting the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty to some extent. As Vice President Sun said: "China must struggle between the two powers so that it can adapt itself to the most advantageous position for the present and the long-term future." We have now reached a time when we need to make a new decision, and this decision will undoubtedly be extremely important to our future national destiny.</p>
<p>Looking forward from painful memories, we can easily see a bright future. Although our current situation is extremely difficult, we should strengthen our self-confidence even more in the midst of hardship. We have come through the arduous War of Resistance, mainly because we have an unshakable belief, a belief that the War of Resistance will be won. Now that the situation is not as we wish, we should strengthen our belief that national construction will be successful. An unshakable belief is the cornerstone of all success. With this belief, we will have brilliant hope, and thus we can see a bright future. It is useless to simply sink into painful memories. We must see our bright future from painful memories and raise our beliefs.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of Foreign Trade</p>
<p>The National Foreign Trade Conference is scheduled to close today. This newspaper has already commented on the convening of this conference. As it closes today, we would like to say a few more words. Everyone feels the difficulty of our country's current economic situation. To overcome the current crisis, the main thing is how to rebuild our export trade. This not only requires plans and programs, but also focuses on implementation. Since China opened to foreign trade, our export trade has always been under the control of foreign merchants. If our country now wants to rebuild our export trade, it should naturally take the interests of the nation and the people as the primary consideration.</p>
<p>Speaking of developing our country's foreign trade, this is not only closely related to our country's foreign exchange assets, but also to our great cause of national construction. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has already issued a written statement on this, and Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, has also issued a written statement to the conference. It can be seen that the government is paying attention to foreign trade. Mr. Chen's remarks are sincere in every sentence, from the way of being a person to trade and economics, and are especially worthy of our deep consideration. He said: "Those who only care about their own interests and do not care about everyone, using the black market to strive for (foreign exchange) to satisfy their own desires, only care about their own convenience, their invisible harm to the public, and the impact on various economic problems, is indescribable." As the Foreign Trade Conference closes, we hope that traders engaged in exports can sincerely cooperate with the government authorities to rebuild our export trade.</p>

<h3>Marshall Urges Reform of the United Nations System, Suggests Establishing a New Executive Body to Handle International Disputes, Vyshinsky Delays Submitting a Reply</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 17th: After US Secretary of State Marshall delivered his policy speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suddenly requested to withdraw the speech originally scheduled to be delivered this afternoon. The motive is unknown. According to general speculation, it may be that the Soviet side needs time to fully study Marshall's speech, or even needs to wait for new instructions from Moscow. As for when Vyshinsky will deliver the Soviet Union's policy speech to the General Assembly, there is no sign to be found. It is reported that Vyshinsky requested the United Nations to put his name on the list of speakers for today on Tuesday. Later, after learning that Marshall's speech launched a major attack on the Soviet Union, he suddenly changed his original intention.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 17th: The organizational work of the United Nations General Assembly was completed last night, and the general debate began today. US Secretary of State Marshall spoke first, and other speakers are scheduled to be representatives from the Soviet Union, Mexico, Poland, Canada, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia.</p>
<p>[United Press New York, 17th Electric Report] US Secretary of State Marshall declared today that the United States accepts the strict restrictions on the veto power of the five permanent members in the Security Council, and formally proposes the establishment of a 55-nation Standing Committee in the United Nations General Assembly to maintain continued meetings. He said that this proposal has nothing to do with admitting that the Security Council has completely failed. He proposed the establishment of a Standing Committee, which is a concrete and microcosmic United Nations General Assembly that meets all year round to monitor the world and the Security Council, so that it can participate and make recommendations when the Security Council fails to fulfill its mission as needed.</p>
<p>Marshall made this proposal in his address during the debate at the opening of the General Assembly today, which was Marshall's first shot in the current stage of the US-Soviet diplomatic war. Soviet representative Vyshinsky is scheduled to reply this afternoon.</p>
<p>Marshall did not mince his words. He warned that the world is facing a crisis, and urged the representatives of the General Assembly to pay attention to the fact that people all over the world are deeply afraid that "they will be involved in a new and more terrible conflict." He did not hesitate to put all the blame for the world's chaos on the Soviet Union. He directly accused the Soviet Union of obstructing the actions of the United Nations, failing to stop the acts of hostility and aggression against Greece, and putting all the blame for delaying the independence of Korea on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Marshall touched on all the main issues that the General Assembly should debate this time, and described the US plans and policies in various degrees of detail. Including:</p>
<p>Seven Major Problems Urgently Need Solutions</p>
<p>(1) "The Veto Power Problem": The United States is willing to constitutionally accept the cancellation of the veto power in terms of non-UN member states applying for membership and implementing all resolutions of the Security Council, only if the proposed method is excessive, but resolutions involving the Security Council's judicial actions are not included. Mr. Ma also advocated the establishment of a special committee to study how to eliminate the problem of "abuse" of the veto power, so as to submit a report to the next General Assembly, so that there can be improvements in the voting rules.</p>
<p>(2) "Increasing the Power of the General Assembly Problem": Marshall advocated the establishment of a special Standing Committee of the General Assembly composed of 55 countries, called the "Interim Committee," dedicated to studying issues related to peace and security, with a term of one year, and then submitting a report to the next General Assembly on whether there is a need to change the committee to a permanent one.</p>
<p>(3) "Korean Issue": Marshall admitted that it was impossible to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, and asked the General Assembly to find a way to achieve the independence of Korea without going through the trusteeship stage. He promised to put forward concrete proposals soon, but for the time being, he will submit this issue to all countries and ask them to make a "fair judgment."</p>
<p>(4) "Greek Issue": He called on the General Assembly to adopt a resolution condemning South, Bulgaria, and Albania for the crime of aggression against Hope, demanding that the countries stop aiding the Greek guerrillas, and establishing a UN General Assembly committee to implement the resolution and investigate whether they are obeying.</p>
<p>(5) "Atomic Energy Problem": Marshall warned that if a consensus cannot be reached on this issue, the US concession on the internationalization of atomic bombs will have to be revised. He also said that if the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate with most countries on this issue, the Atomic Energy Commission will report to the General Assembly that it cannot accomplish the task of international effective control of atomic energy.</p>
<p>(6) "Disarmament Problem": The United States firmly opposes any reduction in armaments until the German-Japanese peace treaty is signed, the Security Council has military power, and an agreement on international control of atomic energy is obtained before this can be done.</p>
<p>(7) "Palestinian Issue": The United States attaches great importance to the recommendations passed by the United Nations Special Committee and endorsed by most countries. Among the recommendations endorsed by most countries, there is a recommendation to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab regions.</p>
<h3>The US's Far-Reaching European Plan May Be Discussed by the General Assembly</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 16th Electric Report] President Truman's two major policies, the Truman Doctrine to prevent communism and the Marshall Plan to revive Europe, will be discussed at the current General Assembly. Senior members of the US delegation declared today that if the Soviet Union does not raise objections to these two policies and force the General Assembly to debate them, the United States is also prepared to automatically submit them for discussion. The US delegation has had this plan in repeated meetings, believing that this move can greatly increase the prestige of the General Assembly and show the US's support for the General Assembly. US policy for this session of the General Assembly has been clarified by Secretary of State Marshall, who decided to strengthen the position of the General Assembly in all aspects in order to save the Security Council from the repeated use of the veto power by the Soviet Union, resulting in a situation where it is becoming increasingly helpless. Submitting President Truman's two major policies to the General Assembly for discussion is a concrete manifestation of this policy, and its significance is extremely important.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Broadcast Address: The Veto Power Should Be Subject to Reasonable Restrictions, Urges All Countries to Abandon All Selfish Interests</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Flushing Meadow, 16th Electric Report] At the invitation of the United Nations Broadcasting Group, Foreign Minister Wang gave a broadcast address in Mandarin today on the importance of the current session of the General Assembly to the country. Foreign Minister Wang said that the veto power issue is now generally focused on, but it is not the root problem facing the United Nations. The truly important issue is whether the member states of the Security Council are determined to cooperate and give the United Nations enthusiastic support. Only such cooperation can lay a sound foundation for the United Nations. Otherwise, the United Nations will not be able to take appropriate action. The strength of the United Nations comes from its member states. If the member states of the United Nations do not cooperate and give the United Nations support, then the United Nations will naturally be weak and incompetent.</p>
<p>Regarding the veto power issue, Foreign Minister Wang reiterated that the Chinese delegation believes that the only feasible measure is for the United Nations General Assembly to "make appropriate interpretations of the United Nations Charter," and impose reasonable restrictions on the use of the veto power. Foreign Minister Wang called on all national policies to aim at internationalism, and should not only care about one's own selfish interests. He said that the establishment of a collective security system cannot be completed quickly. Therefore, he asked the people of the country not to be disappointed or troubled by the many serious difficulties that have occurred, but to redouble their efforts and strive for the ideals of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Chairman Ho Chi Minh Reportedly Has Been Temporarily Executed by French Troops</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 17th Electric Report] According to Vietnamese news obtained from a certain source here, it is rumored that Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Viet Minh government, has been arrested by French troops and subjected to the cruel punishment of beheading. The Viet Minh is in a state of leaderlessness, and the revolutionary action has been suspended. Therefore, the recent situation in Vietnam has been unusually quiet, and there is a new development in which the deposed King Bao Dai is considering taking over the government again. It is reported that this news is still a top secret, and a certain country may be preparing to arrange the political situation in Vietnam to its desired state before making an appropriate announcement, so as to avoid world public opinion from attacking the uncivilized behavior used in handling this matter.</p>
<h3>The Fourteen-Member Steering Committee Has Been Organized, and the Soviet Delegation Only Occupies Two Seats</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Flushing, 16th Electric Report] The United Nations General Assembly has completed the organization of the Steering Committee. The fourteen-member committee includes one chairman of the conference, seven vice-chairmen, and six chairmen of the main committees. That is, China, Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Luxembourg, Chile, Poland, New Zealand, India, Syria, Mexico, Cuba, and other fourteen countries. The committee's duties are to recommend to the General Assembly which issues should be included in the agenda, and it is expected to become the first place for direct conflict between East and West.</p>

<p>According to authoritative sources, the discussion at this meeting has been very successful, but the door to financial aid from these two institutions to the countries concerned is still only open.

<h3>Sino-American Initiators Hold Midnight Meeting on Empty Stomachs; Draft Agreement for Joint Power Plant Completed; Capital of US$20 Million, Half Each from China and the U.S.; Electricity Generation Target of 100,000 Kilowatts per Day</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In order to fundamentally solve the city's electricity shortage, the Municipal Council decided to form the "Shanghai United Power Plant" during its first general meeting. For more than a year, the Bureau of Public Utilities has been planning and promoting this. As the fourth general meeting of the Municipal Council is about to convene, the bureau, recognizing that the city's electricity shortage has reached such a serious stage and that a fundamental solution is urgently needed, invited responsible persons from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and various power companies to hold a preparatory meeting for the joint power company the day before yesterday. According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, who told reporters: The preparatory meeting did not end until 11 o'clock the night before. The Sino-American initiators participating in the meeting each sacrificed their dinner, and the draft agreement for the joint power company was finally completed. It will be submitted to the Municipal Government meeting for discussion tomorrow, and then submitted by the Municipal Government to this session of the Municipal Council for approval, and then sent to the Executive Yuan for record, so as to promote its establishment in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>According to reporter's inquiries: The organizational draft agreement of the Shanghai United Power Company adopts a Sino-American joint venture model, but is actually a Chinese company, and everything will comply with Chinese laws. Its purpose is the cooperation between Chinese and American business circles. The company's capital is set at US$20 million, with China and the U.S. each accounting for half of the capital as a principle, adopting a public share offering method to welcome investment from the American business community, but with a limit of US$10 million. The remaining US$10 million, in addition to the existing power companies in the city subscribing for shares and becoming basic units, the balance will be solicited from influential people in the business community. As for funds from nationalities other than Chinese and American, there are no plans to raise them for the time being.</p>
<p>The detailed provisions of the company's organizational draft agreement will be announced after it is passed by the Municipal Council. Yesterday, Director Zhao solemnly stated to reporters: The electricity generation target after the establishment of the United Power Company has also been decided, which is "to require the company to supply the city with 100,000 kilowatts of electricity per day within five years." If this goal can be achieved, the phenomenon of electricity shortage will not recur in Shanghai.</p>

As for the measures to increase supply, after the Bureau of Public Utilities convened a meeting of responsible persons from various power companies yesterday afternoon to form a power supply review committee, it was decided to ask each company to make its best efforts to increase its possible electricity generation in the coming days. The target is determined as follows: (1) Request the Zhabei Power Company to increase electricity generation by 1,000 kilowatts. (2) Request the Pudong Power Company to increase electricity generation by 200 kilowatts. (3) Request the French Power Company to expedite the installation of a 3,600-kilowatt generator. (4) Request the China Power Company to send a letter to its head office urging the prompt shipment of two 1,000-kilowatt generators so that they can be installed and generate electricity as soon as possible. (5) Dispatch Wang Jingrong, Liu Renqu, and others to form an inspection team to supervise various yarn factories to generate their own electricity. The allocation of 3,000 tons of coal to the China Textile Company has been negotiated, and its four generators can generate electricity on their own, with a generation capacity of 6,000 kilowatts.</p>

<h3>Eryk, Still Outside the Port; Soviet Side Suddenly Claims It is Still in Vladivostok</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After the news that the Soviet ship "Eryk," disregarding our laws, was planning to sail to Shanghai again, our government and all sectors of society have paid close attention to it. Reporters learned yesterday from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the ship had not yet entered the Wusongkou as of last night and was still anchored 20 miles outside the Wusongkou. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a formal order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing yesterday that if the ship enters the Wusongkou without permission, the military and police authorities will be ordered to detain it. It is also learned that the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai did not send anyone to the Office of Foreign Affairs yesterday to negotiate, but went to the Jianghai Customs House the day before to discuss with Tax Commissioner Liu, requesting permission for the ship to enter the port. The Customs authorities refused because they had been informed by the Office of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>However, according to the Soviet side, the ship is still in Vladivostok and has not sailed here. The Office of Foreign Affairs believes this statement is "inaccurate."</p>
<h3>Xu Xueyu's Letter to Jian Guansan Clarifying Treatment</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] During the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th, when discussing the provision of living loans to civil servants, Committee Member Jian Guansan pointed out that the manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) receives a monthly salary of 15 million yuan in addition to the car and Western-style house provided by the government, which is 10 million yuan more than the President of the Yuan. It is learned that Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the CMSNC, sent a special letter to Jian Guansan in response to this, making some clarifications. Excerpts from the original letter are as follows: I have investigated and found that it is true that the CMSNC provides Xueyu with a car for official business. As for my residence at No. 7, Lane 1350, Lin Sen Middle Road, Shanghai, it is a lane house that I share with Mr. Bao Keyong, an advisor to the Ministry of Communications. I rent it entirely myself and pay the rent monthly, which has nothing to do with the CMSNC. As for Xueyu's salary, since the CMSNC implemented the cost of living index system in January 1946, it has been completely suspended. Later, at the strong request of both the Board of Directors and the Ministry of Communications, I received it according to the central government's regulations for civil servants starting in July of the same year, and there is no other income (for example, the public expense salary in August totaled 2,437,084 yuan). I hereby present the facts in detail, hoping for your understanding. Moreover, I deeply admire the fact that this meeting of the Yuan expressed the suffering of all civil servants and studied improvements, with lofty discussions and profound opinions, which coincides with my humble views. Corruption is not inherent in human nature, but entirely due to the pressure of life. If we ignore the hardship of their lives and only sing the high-pitched tune of strict prohibition, we are truly neglecting the root and focusing on the branches. The lack of effectiveness can be foreseen. The gentlemen of the Yuan, in their legislative position, are seeking fundamental relief for all civil servants, which is no less than saving all sentient beings.</p>

<h3>Loud Noise on the Huangpu River; Iron Buckets Fly High; Black Smoke Rises Straight Up; Iron Barge Loading Cargo Explodes and Sinks; Four Men and Women Injured and Missing</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At around 4:50 PM yesterday, an iron barge at the Gonghexiang Wharf suddenly exploded in the cabin. The iron barge was ship number 749 of the China Transport Company. Yesterday, it was extracting sixty boxes of Western medicine and twelve iron buckets of chemicals (sodium perchlorate) from the Danish ship "Gland Tomast Mast Mac" docked at the wharf. Because they were dangerous goods, customs officials sealed the cabin after loading. At this time, white smoke came out of the cabin. At first, no one suspected an accident, but suddenly a wave came and the ship was shaken, causing the iron buckets in the cabin to collide and suddenly explode. With two loud bangs, iron buckets and ship boards flew several feet high. At this time, in addition to the Danish ship docked at the wharf, there was also the CMSNC's "Hai" ship, which was also unloading cargo at the wharf. While hundreds of workers were busy, they suddenly heard two consecutive explosions similar to bombs and saw iron buckets and ship boards flying high. In an instant, they panicked and ran away. The wharf was extremely chaotic. In an instant, the smoke from the iron barge shot straight into the sky. After learning about this, the customs immediately dispatched a fire-fighting launch to put out the fire. After learning that it was a dangerous goods explosion, they dispatched another small tugboat to tow the iron barge to the Pudong Lujiazui riverside, a deep-water area, and sank it to prevent further explosions. After the incident, it was checked that the wharf and the two large ships were undamaged. There were a total of four men, two women, and one child on the iron barge. A total of three people are missing and one is injured. The missing persons are the helmsman (the boss) Hu Yibing, 30 years old, from Anhui. Seaman A Si, 38 years old, from Jiangbei. The wife of the second boss, Jia Zhangshi, 30 years old, is about to give birth. The three are presumed to have been killed in the explosion or sunk in the Huangpu River, which cannot be proven. The injured was Hu Yibing's wife, whose right thigh was blown into a hole. She was rescued by the customs launch to the Xinguankou dock and sent to the hospital for bandaging before being discharged. The second boss happened to be issuing bamboo chips on the Danish ship when the explosion occurred, so he was not harmed. The cook and the child (Hu Yibing's son) both escaped without injury. The child has been taken care of by relatives. As for the aftermath, it remains to be decided by the China Transport Company.</p>
<h3>Landing Craft Sinks Sailboat; Four Boatmen Fall into Water and are Rescued</h3>

The stern of the small sailboat was crushed instantly, and it overturned immediately, with the bottom facing the sky. The Customs launch immediately sailed to rescue them. It was later learned that four boatmen were rescued by the launch and taken to the Customs Port Police Station. The overturned ship was also towed by the Port Police Station launch to Lujiazui in Pudong and anchored. After the accident, the landing craft did not stop and continued to sail south.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Farmland Distribution; Reviving the Rural Economy; Zhu Ping Suggests at the National Political Conference</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The National Land Administration Conference will be held in Nanjing on the 26th of this month. Land administration directors and land experts from various provinces and cities will attend. Zhu Ping, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau, has drafted a proposal on "Promptly Implementing Farmland Reform to Develop the Rural Economy, Stabilize Farmers' Lives, and Complete the Great Cause of Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation," which will be submitted to the conference for discussion. It advocates adjusting farmland distribution to support owner-farmers and assist tenant farmers, so that tillers have their own land, and implementing agricultural mechanization to revive the rural economy. Excerpts from its content are as follows:</p>
<p>Adjusting Farmland Tax Burden</p>
<p>(1) Promptly conduct a survey of the status of tenant farmers and owner-farmers and the land they cultivate, and complete it within a specified time. (2) The county (city) governments should guide landlords to establish rent collection boards and rent collection offices, and guide tenant farmers to organize rent payment unions to implement joint rent collection and joint rent payment. If there are any tenancy issues, the government should resolve them reasonably in accordance with the central government's decisions. (3) Adjust the farmland tax burden and implement reasonable progressive tax rates to reduce landlords' unearned income and force them to abandon their conservative ideas of investing in land and enjoying rent, and shift their investment to economic construction projects.</p>
<p>Investing in Economic Construction</p>
<p>(4) The central government should consider the situation in each province and city and rationally set the maximum amount of privately owned land separately. The excess portion will be collected by the Farmers Bank in installments by issuing land bonds. (Land bonds will be amortized over the years). (5) The annual amortization amount of land bonds obtained by landlords should be guided by the government to invest in economic projects, such as establishing new agricultural tool factories, fertilizer factories, pest control drug factories, electricity and machine irrigation projects, agricultural product processing projects, special product development projects, and agricultural warehouses. (6) After equalizing land rights, the government should guide farmers to organize cooperative farms (inland provinces) and collective farms (remote provinces) in stages and areas, to achieve agricultural collectivization, mechanization, and the implementation of cultivation methods. In addition, state-owned farms should be established to take on the task of technical guidance and demonstration.</p>

<h3>Three Young Women from Suzhou, Seeking Employment, Forced into Prostitution</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Zhou Cuie (17 years old), Zhao Eryuan (17 years old), and Du Genxian (18 years old), three young women from Suzhou, recently came to Shanghai to work as domestic helpers. Zhou and Zhao worked for the Zhang family at 16 Pupo Lane, Chongqing South Road, and Du worked as a helper at No. 12 in the same lane. Due to their shared hometown, they were very close to Zhu Meiying (23 years old), who lived at 7 Yanchang Lane, 74 Yuanchang Road.</p>
<p>Recently, Zhou and the other two girls quit their jobs due to low wages and stayed at 207 Wanyi Lane, Chongqing South Road. At the beginning of this month, Zhou and the other two girls went to Zhu Meiying asking for a job introduction. Zhu readily agreed, but unexpectedly had malicious intentions. Zhu secretly conspired with Cao Xiaomei, who lived at the Yingbin Hotel, 19, 128 Lane, Zhejiang Middle Road, and Chen Meiying, who lived at 62 Ruifu Lane, Guangxi South Road, to lure them to the Yingbin Hotel and force the three girls into prostitution.

<h3>Xikang Yi Ethnic Group Petition Delegation Expresses Beliefs to Reporter from This Newspaper, The New Tide of the Anning River</h3>
<p>[Reported from Nanjing on the 14th by this newspaper] In the triangle area of Sichuan, Kang, and Yunnan, on both sides of the Jinsha River, in the peaks and valleys of the longitudinal mountain range, is the living world of the Yi ethnic compatriots. With Xichang as the center, or along the Anning River, a tributary of the Yalong River, it was formerly the gateway for opium smuggling. Today, it is the main road for importing new concepts, new knowledge, and new lifestyles. The Yi ethnic compatriots have discovered the remoteness of their region, which has prevented them from receiving sufficient attention, and believe that if democracy does not permeate all parts of the country, it is a double misfortune for both the Yi ethnic compatriots and the country. Therefore, they spontaneously decided to petition in the capital. The inconvenience of transportation and excessive obstacles were overcome. After passing through Kunming and Chongqing, they gathered in the capital. They first told reporters about the purpose of this petition:</p>
<p>"The purpose of our petition is to ensure that we have the opportunity to report the situation of our ethnic group to the government from time to time. Participating in legislation is to ensure that the laws enacted in the future are applicable in border areas. Participating in supervision is to promote the legal and reasonable conduct of all political, economic, and cultural matters in border areas. Participating in the provincial assembly is to ensure that all bills take into account the interests of the people and gain their support, and to thoroughly resolve the border affairs that have been unresolved for thousands of years. Hundreds of thousands of border compatriots who are mired in deep water and fire should be connected with the government and become true people of the Republic of China, which is in line with the principle of 'equality among all ethnic groups within the country' advocated by the National Father. We sincerely hope and request that compatriots across the country give us sympathy and strong assistance."</p>
<p>Among the 1.5 million border compatriots in Xikang, more than 500,000 people pay taxes and grain. The total number of Han and Tibetan people in Xikang is 1.7 million, but there is not a single Yi ethnic representative in the Xikang Provincial Assembly. They believe that this</p>
<p>unequal distribution</p>
<p>has a great responsibility for the backwardness of various constructions in border areas. At present, the problems in the mountainous areas are still the common and urgent problems of all areas awaiting development. Transportation, education, and hygiene all deserve our strengthened efforts.</p>
<p>The Yi area is not barren mountains and deserts, but a region with abundant resources and rich products. However, due to inconvenient transportation, not only can natural resources not be developed, but the surplus grains of Leibo, Mabian, and Pingwu were burned in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War due to excessive storage. Now, except for Xichang</p>
<p>which has air transport</p>
<p>, there is only one highway running through the Anning River Valley. The inconvenience of transportation leaves the goods of the Yi area abandoned on the ground, and the dry road with a station every ninety li further hinders the promotion of education. At present, there are three middle schools and nine elementary schools in the Yi area. Including both Yi and Han students, there are only more than 2,000 students. Public schools are difficult to develop due to their location, while schools run by chieftains and people's leaders have many difficult problems to solve. The Yi ethnic compatriots have a strong desire for knowledge, and all</p>
<p>are willing to learn Chinese</p>
<p>. However, they learn to speak first and then learn to read. This indirect learning method, coupled with the late age of enrollment (ten years old) and the unsuitability and lack of teaching materials and equipment, the education in the Yi area urgently needs external assistance. Similarly, health care work in the Yi area especially needs external assistance. An aspirin is a remarkable treasure, and the Yi compatriots still regard diseases as terrible as demons. At the close of the Far Eastern Education Research Conference in Shanghai, it is felt that the establishment of a living foundation for the Yi ethnic group is imminent.</p>
<p>Following the progress of the times, the Yi ethnic compatriots have received democratic education, and they</p>
<p>focus on reality</p>
<p>and issued a call: "Our petition is reasonable, and participating in politics and building the Yi area is our right and our obligation. We hope that this patriotic act of a small ethnic group can be understood, sympathized with, and supported by all." (Reporter Pu Dejie)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Flee to Anhui, Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Completely Suppress</h3>
<p>[Reported from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang stated that the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops had fled into the Dabie Mountains, invaded Jiang, Liu'an, Zhenshan, and Lihuang and other places, and disturbed Hefei. The provincial government again telegraphed all commissioners, county chiefs, and mayors that they must increase vigilance and make every effort to suppress the remaining bandits within the territory, strengthen and consolidate the border, and establish local security.</p>
<p>[Also reported] Communist bandits are rampant in Pizhou County. The newly编 Eighth Division of the Communist bandits, the 17th and 19th regiments, etc., with full equipment and led by bandit deputy division commander Su Peiyuan, captured the Tiefo Temple and Beifengchang area of the 7th District last month, and continued to invade southward, attacking Chahe Bridge Head in the 6th District, Yishulianfang Mountain Nanfengchang, etc. After the local teams bravely resisted, they were successively captured due to the disparity in strength, and they burned, killed, and looted with extremely cruel means. Dozens of people, including Dong Entan, were brutally killed, and property and livestock were swept away. The people could not bear it and fled one after another.</p>
<h3>Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiading Counties Hold Suppression Meeting</h3>
<p>Division Commander Yao Arrives to Give Guidance</p>
<p>[Reported from Changshu on the 15th by this newspaper] The suppression meeting of Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiading counties was held here on the 15th, chaired by County Chief Zhang. Youth Army Division Commander Yao specially came to the scene to give guidance and inspect the river defense. It is reported that this suppression is very large in scale. Once the deployment is ready, the four counties will launch activities simultaneously, dividing into regular and mobile troops, and will completely suppress all hidden bandits within a time limit to maintain security.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Election Becomes Heated, Catering and Hotel Industry is Booming</h3>

<h3>Yoshiko Kawashima, Her Cry is Sorrowful, Imprisoned for Two Years, Text Long at Two Thousand, Prison Atmosphere Leaps Off the Paper</h3>
<p>[Reported from Beiping on the 17th by this newspaper] Jin Bihui (also known as Yoshiko Kawashima), who has been imprisoned for nearly two years without a verdict, has been working hard to learn Chinese and write articles in the women's prison education class. When she appeared in court yesterday to testify in the property dispute case of Min Lutongxuan, a resident of Tianjin, she took out an article entitled "My Two Years of Prison Life," intending to submit it to the reporter for publication in this newspaper. The article described the hardships of her prison life, and expressed her immense longing for "Little Monkey" (Xiao Fu), who used to be inseparable from her. She then appealed to people to treat well the monkey Xiao Fu, who had lost his master, saying in the article: "He is a smart and lovely little animal. He has not committed any crime, he will not betray the country. I am his little master, I dare to say this sentence." Finally, the writing turned to defending herself, saying: "Could it be said that I, the little master, am not as good as him? It's really a false accusation. I will never betray the country, I can't forget my motherland. Xiao Fu! Xiao Fu! Your master will never be a traitor"! The article is more than 2,000 characters long. The loneliness and suffering of prison life leaps off the paper. It can be said that "when a bird is about to die, its cry is sad." (Special correspondent Zhang Jianmei)</p>
<h3>Empty Big Stores Act as Guarantors, Fujian Grain Criminal Flees to Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Reported from Fuzhou on the 15th by this newspaper] Lin Zi Pei, Deputy Director of the Land and Grain Office of Linsen County, was sentenced to four years in prison for corruption and dereliction of duty, as reported in this newspaper. The criminal was granted bail by the court due to illness, which aroused the attention of the government, the assembly, and public opinion in this area. The provincial government believed that the sudden bail of the criminal Lin would inevitably attract criticism, and had sent a letter to the court requesting a reply. The provincial, county, and municipal assemblies had dispatched assembly members to the court to question the bail process. The public opinion organs stated that the criminal Lin was flaunting his bail release and parading through the streets, showing no signs of illness. The court was suspected of favoritism and releasing him. The newspapers criticized it strongly. Regarding the bail process of the criminal Lin, it was learned that after the verdict, the prison guards submitted two signed documents stating that the criminal was seriously ill and should be released on bail. The handling judge ordered him to be brought to court for examination. The prison guards reported back to the judge that the criminal was too ill to move. Therefore, bail was granted. Before the bail, the criminal made careful arrangements, first having people open two empty stores in Nantai, claiming to have a capital of 2 billion yuan, to serve as his storefronts for bail. After being released on bail, he fled to Taiwan in a few days. From this, it can be seen that the rice weevil is cunning and the court is biased and perverting the law. Public opinion is in an uproar, and the court has not yet made any statement.</p>
<h3>Beiping Relief General Administration Colludes with Corrupt Criminals, Transferred to Beiping Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] Relief General Administration Jin Sui Cha Branch Commissioner Yu Baihua, Deputy Director of the Storage and Transportation Group and Director of the Beiping Warehouse Zheng Zuyin, and Director of the Beiping Customs Xiyuan Airport Office Shen Weishan, abused their powers and colluded in corruption. After being reported by Relief General Administration consultant Li Guanghe, the criminals were arrested successively in Beiping and have been transferred to the court for handling. Yu Baihua obtained the consent of Relief General Administration staff member An Dingyuan (Belgian priest from the Hongdong Diocese) and, under the guise of relief supplies from the Hongdong Diocese, used the Relief General Administration airlift team to transport 83 bales of cotton cloth from Beiping to Beiping three times from June 20 to 22. Yu transported 70 bales of cotton cloth from the Beiping Plains to Beiping at a freight rate of 50,000 yuan per kilogram. When picking up the goods in Beiping, it was discovered that 27 bales of cloth were not contracted for transportation, so he extorted 200 million yuan from the consignors. The consignors reported to Li Guanghe that Yu's transportation of cotton cloth in Beiping was known to Shen Zashan, director of the Customs Xiyuan Airport Office. Shen took the opportunity to coerce Zheng Zudi, director of the warehouse in charge of storage and transportation in Beiping Plains, to transport 27 bales of cotton cloth on his behalf. Zheng, fearing that the plot would be exposed, agreed to his request. Shen gave Zheng 30 million yuan from what he had obtained. The 56 bales of cloth that Yu transported in Beiping belonged to the Desiang family in Beiping, totaling 294,630,000 yuan. Before Yu obtained this money, he was discovered and monitored by the consultant. The 27 bales of cotton cloth handled by Shen Wei on behalf belonged to the Xie Xingzhi and other seven companies in Beiping. The freight rate was 40,000 yuan per kilogram, and Shen embezzled more than 100 million yuan. The stolen funds were the difference in freight rates. The airlift team transported relief supplies between Beiping and Beiping at only 1,953 yuan per kilogram.</p>
<p>[Reported from Taipei on the 13th by this newspaper] Taiwan has a lot of wood, but there is a timber shortage everywhere. The forestry administration and transportation should be responsible for this. Due to the difficulty in obtaining a supply of wood, the paper industry was the first to suffer. The Taipei Paper Mill of the Paper Industry Company was originally</p>
<h3>Bamboo Pulp Paper New Initiative, Taiwan Province Paper Industry Embarks on a Turning Point</h3>
<p>It is the only wood pulp paper mill in our country, but now it has to explore alternative raw materials.</p>
<p>Taichung, Hsinchu, and Yilan areas are rich in Kuei bamboo. Under normal economic conditions, bamboo is more expensive than wood, but now the price of bamboo is one-third lower than wood, and wood is calculated by volume, while bamboo is calculated by weight. The production area of bamboo is low, and transportation is convenient. Under these many favorable conditions, the Japanese used to work hard to study and test it. The world's standard method for cooking bamboo uses soda (i.e., caustic soda), and the Japanese also invented the magnesium bisulfite method, but both of these methods cannot suit today's environment; one ton of caustic soda costs nearly 500,000 Taiwan dollars, and the caustic soda used to make one pound of paper is not even enough to buy half a pound of paper, and the paper is light yellow; the magnesium oxide required by the magnesium bisulfite method originally came from the Northeast, but now the communist bandits are harassing and it is impossible to obtain it, and the disadvantage of this method is that bleaching is difficult.</p>
<p>The Taipei Paper Mill used the original pulp making machine and calcium bisulfite liquid to try to cook bamboo material, and the quality of the bamboo pulp obtained was very poor. Later, the factory director Lin added a trace amount of alkaline substance to the medicine liquid and steamed it at 140 degrees Celsius for 12 hours, and discovered a few amazing achievements: 1. Bleaching is extremely easy, only 4% of effective chlorine is needed to bleach it to snow white. 2. Puling is rapid, and paper can be copied in two hours. 3. The paper quality is better than wood pulp paper. 4. The whiteness is higher than the soda method and the magnesium gasification method. 5. This method is still extremely effective in treating reeds and sugar cane residue. In this way, it can replace the magnesium gasification in the Northeast, and the medicinal materials are produced in this province, so it is not difficult to obtain them. Especially its economic value is worthy of praise, because Taiwan has even more inexhaustible raw materials - bamboo. In the past, bamboo could only provide Taiwanese with bamboo shoots and furniture!</p>
<p>In the midst of the paper shortage, this is a major turning point for the Taiwan paper industry. It is estimated that there is no problem in producing 40 to 50 tons of paper a day. The Taipei factory has planned to apply for a patent for this new initiative! (Reporter Yang Wenyu)</p>

The reply stated: "Having received and reviewed the report, after the soldiers have been inspected and accepted by the military region troops, there should be no further supplementary conscription if accidents occur.

<h3>Graduates of Unregistered Private Schools to Be Registered for Qualification Screening</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has been ordered by the Ministry of Education to conduct a screening of graduates from unregistered private schools, including Private East China University, Private University of Shanghai, Private China Comparative Law School, Sino-French Private Law and Business School, and Shanghai Private Conservatory of Music. The proposed measures are as follows: (1) To formulate regulations for the organization of the qualification screening committee: To conduct the qualification screening, it is necessary to first organize a qualification screening committee. Referring to the Ministry's promulgated measures for the qualification screening of graduates from colleges and universities in the recovered areas and the regulations for the organization of the teaching staff qualification screening committee, the "Organizational Regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Qualification Screening Committee for Graduates of Unregistered Private Colleges and Universities" will be formulated and implemented. (2) To revise the forms for qualification screening and registration review: In the past, the Shanghai Teaching Staff Screening Committee of the Ministry of Education conducted a screening of graduates from enemy-puppet and private colleges and universities in the city.

<h3>Datong University Overcharges Students. The Student Union Hosted Reporters Yesterday to Report on Parents' Difficulties in Raising Funds.</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Shanghai College and University Association determined that the total tuition and miscellaneous fees for private universities in the city this semester should not exceed 1.6 million yuan. At the meeting where Mayor Wu and others hosted donations to scholarships at the International Hotel on the 23rd of last month, President Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua University and former Director of the Education Bureau Gu Yuxiu publicly announced this, making it a final decision. It is reported that Datong University is currently violating the above resolution by overcharging, causing student dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3 p.m., the Datong University Student Union hosted reporters at Xiangxueyuan to report on the situation. The person in charge of the union reported on the school's fees with a low voice, seemingly unable to bear the grief and indignation. It is said that the tuition and miscellaneous fees for Datong University this semester, as announced by the school, are set at 1.8 million yuan, and together with the experiment fee of 1.04 million yuan, the total is as high as more than 2.8 million yuan. Most of the students' parents are salaried workers, and it is very common for families to have two or three children in school. After this war, who has enough savings to make ends meet? Moreover, commerce and industry have declined, and the price of rice and firewood is high. It is already difficult to raise 1.6 million yuan for tuition. Now, the school authorities have violated the regulations of the municipal authorities and unilaterally raised the amount to such an extent. The majority of students will be forced to drop out of school. They urgently appeal to the society for sympathy and report the following six requests to the school authorities: (1) The maximum tuition and miscellaneous fees should be 1.6 million yuan; (2) Fees should be paid in two installments, with half paid first; (3) Impoverished students should register for classes first and pay fees later; (4) Establish free quotas: 15% fully exempt, 10% half exempt; (5) Salaries for teachers and staff should also be paid in two installments; (6) Withdraw the order to "force students to transfer schools." Finally, the person in charge reported on the school's scholarship situation, stating: Datong University currently has 2,350 students, including new students (this is the number reported by President Hu of the school to the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee). The school has approved only 23 students with full tuition waivers, 20 students with three-quarters tuition waivers, 112 students with half waivers, and 30 students with one-quarter waivers, totaling 185 people equivalent to 102 full waivers. Adding the 9 students approved for scholarships by the alumni association, this accounts for 4.9% of the total number of students. According to government regulations, the full waiver quota for scholarships should account for 10% of the total number of students, that is, 235 students should be fully exempt, not including other free quotas.</p>
<p>[Another report] The union has submitted reports to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee, reporting on the school's fees. Mayor Wu has also agreed to meet with representatives of the union within days to inquire about the situation.</p>

<h3>National Foreign Trade Conference Extended Session Concludes Today; President Zhang Sends Representative to Read Written Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Foreign Trade Conference was held at 10:00 AM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. Over a hundred representatives attended, chaired by Shou Jingwei. First, he introduced the foreign guests present to the assembly. Then, he invited Mr. John Binham, director of the British Chamber of Commerce, to speak. He mainly said that since China's control of imports and exports, the difficulties faced in imports include: (1) After import restrictions, the import of raw materials and equipment has sharply decreased, making it difficult to maintain existing industries, and further slowing down industrialization. (2) The announcement of quotas was too sudden, making it impossible for the industry to adapt, causing various serious problems. The issuance of import licenses and foreign exchange application forms is too slow. The difficulties of the export industry are: (1) Chinese products cannot obtain foreign markets because prices and labor costs are too high. (2) China can only increase exports by developing agriculture. Major export products such as silk, tea, pig bristles, tung oil, fur, and soybeans, if selected for excellent varieties and long-term cultivation, improve quality, and establish international credit, all have hope for large exports. (3) China's main industrial raw material, cotton, should make every effort to increase production to be self-sufficient. Although cotton is not an export product, this move can greatly reduce the burden on foreign exchange. Mr. Hai finally expressed an optimistic view, saying that if China has a long-term plan, it will surely become a major production center. The Chinese are diligent and hardworking, so efforts to expand exports will surely be fruitful.</p>
<p>Yang Ge Advocates Rewarding Exports</p>
<p>Consultant of the Central Bank, Mr. Yang, was invited to give a speech. Mr. Yang advocated that China should have a concrete policy of rewarding exports. Measures that have been implemented and should be implemented are: (1) Abolish export taxes. (2) Rationalize the tax rate of domestic export goods. (3) The exchange rate should be kept reasonable so that local products can be exported in large quantities. (4) Explore the resources of Taiwan and the Northeast to make them a source of exports. Later, the Canadian Commercial Counselor, Mr. Goldstone, and the representative of the British-Iranian Oil Company, Mr. Gordon, were also invited to speak.</p>
<p>President Zhang Sends Representative to Speak</p>
<p>At this point, Pan Xulun arrived and represented the President of the Executive Yuan to give instructions. The main points were: (1) Welcome foreign businessmen to invest in China. The government is paying close attention to and remedying various factors that hinder foreign trade, such as high costs and hoarding. (2) Rice, wheat, and cotton are the source of food and clothing, and efforts should be made to increase production and not rely on foreign countries. Agriculture, industry, and commerce are closely related and should cooperate closely. (3) Commercial ethics should be quickly restored to develop foreign trade on a large scale.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ge Jingzhong of China Silk Company, Wu Weijing of China Textile, Xi Changtong, manager of the International Department of the Bank of China, and Xin Jian, Zhang Xiaomei, and Fang Shanggui delivered speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>Afternoon Discussion of Proposals from Various Groups</p>
<p>The conference continued at 2:00 PM to discuss the examination reports of the proposals from various groups. Multiple proposals from the Trade Policy Group, the Export Raw Materials Group, the Finance Group, the Consortium Group, the Barter Trade Group, and the Machinery Products Group were amended and passed. During the discussion, guest speakers gave speeches. Commercial Counselor of the United States, Mr. Kyle, gave a speech. After reviewing China's trade deficit, Mr. Kyle pointed out that imports have increased to 400 million US dollars, while exports are less than half. "Agriculture is the best friend of the export industry." If the burden on farmers can be reduced and farmers are encouraged to produce with reasonable purchase prices, the export volume will surely increase greatly. Silk fabrics, wool blankets, soybeans, vegetable oil, etc. can be exported in large quantities to earn foreign exchange. Ling Xianyang, President of Shanghai University, said that to develop China's foreign trade, attention must be paid to the following two things: (1) Increase farmers' purchasing power, improve farmers' lives, and increase agricultural production. (2) Restore China's original commercial ethics. Miao Yuntai, a member of the National Economic Council, delivered a speech, agreeing with Ling Xian's proposition, saying that "agriculture produces, industry completes, and commerce manages." The three industries are closely related and should cooperate closely. The discussion lasted until 4:30 PM. Due to heated debates, there were still many proposals that had not been discussed. It was decided to extend the meeting for one day. The conference also passed the temporary motions of Chu Zhucheng and Luo Qinghua, telegraphing Foreign Minister Wang to insist on the veto power of the four major powers.</p>
<h3>Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 7,600 stones of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The mainland continued to rise, and the prices increased. Japonica rice rose by more than 10,000 yuan, and indica rice, which was fragrant and dry, rose sharply by more than 20,000 yuan. White yuan new japonica rice also saw an increase of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The allocation price of flour increased by 2,000 yuan, the quota was reduced by half, and raw materials gradually rose, and people's hearts became firm. Unified flour, miscellaneous brand flour, and factory flour all saw a continued increase of 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Bran and Fujian stomach were suspended, falling back by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and the situation stopped rising and turned to fall. Soybean cake seemed to be the same.</p>
<p>Soybean oil factories had no appetite for imports due to the sharp drop in edible oil. Customers did not move, and the local market also watched and waited. Customers were firm in selling due to the scarcity of goods, forming a stalemate. Mung beans remained firm and handsome, and broad beans continued to move sporadically, soaring step by step, adding another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sesame was slightly taken by the local market, high and low were stalled, raw kernels continued to be weak by 10,000 yuan. Corn from the North Sea was still selected high, high materials were lively, and medium and low were sluggish. Red sorghum arrived in succession, wineries were not poor, the North Sea did not move, and the price was three to five thousand yuan. Wheat production and sales were inverted, and continued to stand at two to three thousand yuan. It is also reported that the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse allocated rice to public servants and teachers in this city last month, using Brazilian white round rice, which was well received by all parties. Recently, because there was no more Brazilian white round rice available, Brazilian brown rice has been changed to be processed and distributed. Although this rice also comes from Brazil, it is longer in shape and slightly different from round rice, but it tastes quite good.</p>
<h3>Free Trading of Flour Trial Begins on the 18th</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of restoring free trade of flour, the Materials Advisory Committee of the China Trust Bureau convened a meeting of major manufacturers and flour and bran industry trade associations at 4:00 PM on the 17th and decided to temporarily start a trial on the 18th. It is reported that the reason for the cancellation of the mandatory low-price dumping is roughly the same as that of edible oil. In order to prevent the backflow of flour, arbitrage by merchants, and encourage production, it is necessary to temporarily restore free trade. In order to be cautious, the Association also instructed that the factory's free price should be based on the following three principles: (1) Inventory on hand, (2) Current market price, (3) Future replenishment.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Greatly; Market Firms at Closing</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks first shrunk yesterday, then stabilized. Credit remained tight, and deliveries surged again. Hengshu's interest rate was forced to increase to 2.25 and 2.7 points. In the morning, due to the change of units in the afternoon, most people settled, and it was still downstream. However, the cotton cloth payment has been issued. People's hearts have calmed down slightly, so the delivery stocks were slightly popular in the afternoon. However, because the situation of swap settlement varied greatly, the process fluctuated greatly, and there was a glimmer of life at the closing.</p>
<p>Early morning</p>
<p>Saw low prices. Yongsha opened, starting from 234 yuan and 235 yuan, there was a supply from No. 133, forcing it down to within 230 yuan. No. 154 and others slightly accepted at the low price, and struggled quite a bit around 230 yuan. After hovering until 10:30 AM, off-site deliveries surged even more, and the interest rate opened high at 2.25 and 2.7 points, and finally collapsed. No. 76 and others sold again, pressing Yongsha down to an immediate delivery price of 226 yuan and a deferred delivery low price of 26 yuan. Later, No. 116 maintained it at the low price, and No. 104 came to deliver Yongsha. After 11:15 AM, it gradually rose slightly. No. 204 and others bought deferred Yongsha, and No. 181 and others also bought current Yongsha. It was heard that the yarn payment had been issued, and the credit was expected to turn around. It had rebounded to an immediate delivery price of 231 yuan and a deferred delivery price of 232 yuan. No. 172 showed current Yongsha, and No. 218 and others also settled deferred Yongsha. The noon closing ended at a price of 227 yuan and 228 yuan. The shouting price after the closing was stable. The remaining stocks were also slightly dragged down, especially small mature stocks. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yongsha, Maya, and Huafeng saw a slight decline in immediate delivery stocks, Xinhua and Qinxing were still flat, Zhongfa, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Xinhe each fell by half a percent, Zhongsi was flat, Jinglun fell by a weak ten percent, underwear and Xinya fell by half a percent, Yongye rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. The deferred delivery stocks included Yongsha and Huafeng, which did not fall much, and Xinhe, Maya, Xinguang, and Jingfu each fell by half a percent, and Qinxing fell by a weak ten percent.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>For immediate delivery, the off-site quotation was already high. It was heard that there was a settlement of kerosene, and the exchange rate was again speculated. Yongsha opened high at 233 yuan. Although No. 43 and others absorbed it, No. 173 and others sold it, forming a stalemate after the opening. Later, due to a false rumor that the National Bank's exchange差進, it was once sold by No. 235 and others to 229 yuan. No. 222 and others also sold current Xinhe, also forcing it down to 109 yuan. When the result of the exchange was actually差出, No. 169 and others bought, hovered and rose. Yongsha closed at 233 yuan, and the shouting price was slightly lower after the closing. As a result, compared with the closing in the morning, Zhabei Huafeng, Lian, and underwear were still flat, Zhongsi fell slightly, Jinglun rose by half outside, and the rest rose slightly. The old stocks outside the market were slightly weak.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the capital increase of China Cement has been completed, and the new shares will be determined this morning, and the transaction unit will be temporarily set at 50,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Rise Slightly; Foreign Stocks Fluctuate Unevenly</h3>
<p>Public bonds rebounded yesterday, Unified C was still mediocre, and Unified D rose relatively more. The transaction volume was about 5 million. Unified C opened in the morning at 10,600 yuan, and Runde and Rooms 550 and 503 entered to 11,200 yuan. Rooms 230 and 538 sold, retreating to 10,800 yuan at the close. Compared with the previous closing, A, B, and C each rose by 200 yuan, Unified D rose by 600 yuan, and Unified E only rose by 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks, yesterday, British United was popular due to the news of the merger, and the remaining stocks rose and fell due to the timing of the market closing. Securities帮 先出後進, Guangbang and Yanghang all bought. Yisha opened in the morning at 94,000 yuan, heard from 93,500 yuan, rose to 97,000 yuan at the close. Compared with the previous closing, British United rose by half a percent alone, and Xiangtai was also the same.

It is learned that the first redemption drawing of the bonds is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 25th of this month. In order to be cautious, the Ministry of Finance specially wired the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, notifying the branches in various places to inform the collection agencies and banks to temporarily suspend the exchange of bonds from the 24th of this month, and to list the types, numbers, and numbers of bonds that have not been exchanged on the same day and report them for verification. After the drawing on the 25th, the unissued bonds with the winning numbers will be removed and destroyed before continuing to be exchanged. The person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that he hopes that people who have purchased the US Dollar Bonds in various places will take the appointment certificates to the original issuing banks and banks to exchange for the bonds before the 24th of this month to avoid losing the opportunity to win this time. It is also heard that the short-term treasury bills for the 36th year have also been fully printed and returned to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and the Ministry of Finance has urged the Bureau to distribute them to various places for exchange as soon as possible so that the principal and interest can be paid at maturity.</p>

<p>Cotton Cloth Rebounds</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was initially weak and then firm. The price of low-end fine cloth was firmer. As a result, the price of fine cloth at the head was 529,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared with the previous day.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The cotton yarn price negotiation of the Silk Spinning Association remained unchanged yesterday and remained at the Monday listing price.</p>
<p>It is also reported that China Textile Construction Company sold yarn in groups A and B as usual yesterday. Group A sold a total of 1,735 pieces, and there were 1115 application forms.

The above two groups sold a total of 3,225 pieces of yarn, equivalent to 4,350 pieces of 20-count yarn, and there were 1025 application forms.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Turns Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current cotton market turned weak. Due to tight credit, peers were quite lazy to accept. Due to the continued decline in cotton yarn, yarn factories relaxed their intentions and the prices were unable to sustain and fell. The transaction was not prosperous throughout the day, and 890 bales were transacted.</p>
<h3>China Trust Promotes Yarn and Cloth Export</h3>
<p>Mainly in Southeast Asia and the Near East</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The imported foreign cotton purchased by the China Trust Bureau has now been handed over to Shen Textile Construction Company and private yarn factories for spinning. The factory has also paid out about 7,000 pieces of spun yarn and handed them over to the China Trust Bureau. Currently, the China Trust Bureau is in contact with Textile Construction Company to discuss exports, mainly to Manila, Siam, Hong Kong, and the Near East, and some of them are cotton cloth.</p>
<h3>Joint Distribution of Yarn Production; Difficult for Private Factories to Accept</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the point in the revised textile adjustment plan of the National Economic Commission's review group that all yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories should be jointly distributed, private manufacturers have recently held several meetings, believing that it is difficult to accept. It is said that joint distribution of cotton yarn has been held many times in the past, and the results have not been good.</p>
<h3>Interest Income on Securities Deposits Taxed at 5 Percent</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding the change of the tax rate on the interest income tax of the third category of securities deposits to 5 percent, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that it will be implemented from June of this year. As for the bond part, the interest income tax to be levied is also handled at a tax rate of 5 percent. It is also learned that the tax standard for the redemption and interest payment of various bonds was originally stipulated to be based on the date of payment of the principal and interest of the bonds. From June of this year, it has been temporarily changed to a tax rate of 5 percent. The meaning is that regardless of the maturity of the coupons, they will be collected at 5 percent in order to simplify the procedures and facilitate calculation.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Selling Strongly; Prices Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>The supply and demand of the oil market is normal, and the selling atmosphere is strong. Factories do not hesitate to spit out at low prices, and the market situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Soybean oil has plummeted by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, rapeseed oil has plummeted by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, raw oil has also fallen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and clear oil has also plummeted by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and sesame oil has fallen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>The rayon market was extremely weak yesterday morning because web manufacturers stopped doing business due to the excessively high price. The opening was small. No. 120 Takayama Yukou first shouted 32.5 million yuan, but no one asked, and continued to fall. The minimum price at noon closing was 2.1 million yuan, and Dongyang was 2.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the fact that actual sales customers took advantage of the price drop and had a slight appetite for imports, the market rebounded again. The final price rose to 3 million yuan again, and Dongyang 3.5 million yuan. As a result, it fell by 300,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The factory's business was flat and soft yesterday. Because the prices had risen too much for several days, buyers were watching, and the transaction was very small. The shouting prices of all levels remained unchanged. The cotton goods market was slightly weak yesterday.</p>

<h3>"Special Issue on Fundamental Education"</h3>
<p>— Oriental Stone</p>
<p>Published by the Research Department of the National College of Social Education</p>
<p>"Education and Society" Volume 6, Issues 2 and 3</p>
<p>There are very few regular publications on social education academics in China, and the quarterly "Education and Society" compiled by the National College of Social Education has always been known as the torch of the social education community. In order to cooperate with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Chinese government to jointly convene the Far East Regional Conference on Basic Education Research in Nanjing, a "Special Issue on Basic Education" was specially compiled in the second and third issues of Volume 6 of the publication, which was published on September 1.</p>
<p>The term "fundamental education" cannot be regarded as novel in China's education community. Because the purpose of "fundamental education" as stipulated by the United Nations organization is: "To eliminate illiteracy, promote primary education in relatively backward countries, and promote mass education." In the course of advocating new education in China for decades, there have already been the promotion of various education undertakings such as civil education, compulsory education, mass education, and social education, the nature and meaning of which are roughly the same as "fundamental education"; Since the implementation of national education in the 29th year of the Republic of China, children's education has been merged with mass education and social education, so that people can cultivate their national consciousness, production skills, and common sense of science and hygiene in addition to literacy, which is enough to show that "fundamental education" in China has already had a positive move; When the United Nations organization held its first conference in Paris in November 1946, it decided to hold the first regional research meeting on fundamental education in the capital of China - Nanjing, also because it believed that China was a pioneer in the promotion of modern education. However, China is a large country with poor people, and with the natural disasters and human errors of the past hundred years, the cycle continues endlessly. Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen guided the national revolution and strived to improve the people's lives, even today, more than half of the people are still inevitably struggling in the plight of poverty, weakness, ignorance, and selfishness, spending their pitiful lives. Therefore, in today's research and discussion of "fundamental education", whether it is the "new trend of world education" of the present era, or "it already exists in China", it is still an important matter worthy of national attention.</p>
<p>The first article in the column, "My Beliefs in Basic Education" by Chen Lijiang, shows the role of education and culture as a reflection of the economic system in a very profound and clear way. And hoping that the power of fundamental education will enable the people of all countries to be trained into pure world citizens and create new educational philosophical concepts is indeed an accurate and unchanging theory. Next, Mr. Zhang Zhian's "Social Education and World Peace" put forward the path of educational transformation based on the principle of building world peace, which is indeed a fierce awakening that is worthy of people around the world to re-evaluate the value of education.</p>
<p>China promotes civil education, compulsory education, social education, and national education, and even immediately strives for the fundamental education marked out this time. I am afraid that it will still inevitably repeat the mistakes of the past few decades - the culture has been swept away as it is eliminated, and Zhizhi will always maintain a long distance from the progress of atomic research. The reason for this lies entirely in the restrictions of politics and economy. This point is singled out, and Mr. Gu Mei's "Basic Problems of Basic Education" does have its unique insights. What is regrettable is that in today's post-robbery mountains and rivers, which are riddled with holes, these so-called basic problems are probably still not easy to solve!</p>
<p>All countries and ethnic groups in the world have different social conditions and historical backgrounds. China has been rooted in the traditional living habits of the nation for thousands of years due to feudal consciousness; and because Qing Dynasty didn't fix it, it became the target of encirclement and attack by the powers and fell into the misfortune of being a sub-colony, causing the people to fall outside the political circle; To this day, it is still a country without science, without construction, or even without production tools and production technology. People's lives are always struggling on the edge of the death line. Under such circumstances, should the promotion of fundamental education have special emphasis and start? Mr. Dong Weichuan's article "The Unique Significance of Fundamental Education in China" not only lists the crux of the matter without any scruples, but also clearly indicates the path that China must take to promote fundamental education.</p>
<p>Mr. Shu Xincheng has made many contributions to the construction of China's cultural undertakings; Wang Weizhi's Light Born has been hosting the Radio and Television Department of Shejiao College with his unremitting work and hard-working creative perseverance. Now, the magazine contains two articles, "The Plan for Promoting Electrified Education in Basic Education" by Shu and "The Theory of Literacy Education Films and Our Production" by Wang. Both articles have a definite assessment of the use of new tools of fundamental education - sensory aids, including film and broadcast, - in education. The former formulates a detailed plan based on China's actual environment, and the latter creates something with the spirit of research and experimentation, which can be used for reference and adoption when promoting basic education.</p>
<p>The two work reports of the National Education Experimental Zone and the Social Education Experimental Zone of the college can not only be used as explanations when receiving representatives to the Basic Education Conference for visits, but also for general reference when implementing basic education. Mr. Gu Yuezhong's "A Bird's-Eye View of Fundamental Education in Various Countries After the War" also has something that can be borrowed from China.</p>
<h3>How to be a Little Teacher</h3>
<p>— Gao Ning</p>
<p>(Written by Tao Xingzhi, published by Commercial Press, 35 pages in the book, priced at 1500 yuan.)</p>
<p>Educational theorist Tao Xingzhi's pioneerization, regardless of his beliefs, still has merit for China's education community. Mr. Zhu Jingzhi was a friend of his life, and as far as the reporter knows, he also highly admired his educational theories.</p>
<p>When Tao taught poor children, he adopted the little teacher system. This book "How to be a Little Teacher" is the guidance method for being a little teacher - the implementation plan of new education.</p>
<p>The content of this book includes: (1) Why be a little teacher, (2) Find students, (2) Do you need a textbook? (4) Literacy or reading? (5) Activity materials, (6) Gramophone and radio, (7) The function of the map, (8) Know what to teach, (9) The time to teach people, (10) Don't put on airs, (11) Be humble in learning, (12) Teach your students to be little teachers too, (13) Little Teacher Corps, (14) One becomes two, (15) Pin your students down, and let your students pin you down.</p>
<p>These fifteen steps are the necessary steps to be a little teacher. In today's China, where education is not universal, the little teacher system can at least be used as a reference for eliminating illiteracy. I believe that this can solve many problems in popularizing education.</p>
<p>When everyone is discussing how to promote fundamental education, we put forward this book as a work and book for developing teaching.</p>
<p>I hope that every young friend will read this book, and then carefully implement the task of popularizing education, then the happiness of the Chinese people will be endless.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stereoscopic Topographic Map</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>(Historical Geography Chart Compilation Society)</p>
<p>(Published by Yaguang Cartography Society)</p>
<p>(First Edition, June of the Thirty-Sixth Year)</p>
<p>I am now introducing to readers a stereoscopic topographic map. In the past, the mapping of topographic maps of our country was all two-dimensional. Although two-dimensional topographic maps can also indicate the high and low terrain, they still cannot provide map readers with a thorough understanding of the national terrain. Therefore, stereoscopic topographic maps were created.</p>
<p>As far as I know, there are currently two types of stereoscopic topographic maps published in our country: The first type is the stereoscopic topographic map of the "New Provincial Maps of China" compiled by Mr. Weng Wenhao, Mr. Ding Wenjiang, and Mr. Zeng Shiying, published by the Shenbao Newspaper. Its vertical scale is about fifteen times the two-dimensional scale. The second type is the "Great China Stereoscopic Topographic Map" edited by the Historical Geography Chart Compilation Society, published by the Yaguang Cartography Society, with a scale of 1:6,300,000.</p>
<p>The "New Provincial Maps of China" published by Shenbao Newspaper took the lead; as for the "Great China Stereoscopic Topographic Map," its larger map size is convenient for hanging, which may be its advantage.</p>
<p>The political regions of the Nine Northeastern Provinces have recently been re-divided. The re-division of the Nine Northeastern Provinces is presumably what map readers are eager to know. This map has been redrawn based on the boundaries announced by the National Government.</p>
<p>The lower corner of this map contains a general description of the map, clearly presenting the topographic features of the entire country. It divides the national terrain into four major parts, each further divided into several sub-regions: (1) Tibetan Plateau, (2) Mongolian-Xinjiang Plateau, (3) Adjacent areas of the Great Plateau, further divided into five regions: Hinggan Mountains, Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau, Central Mountains, Sichuan Basin, and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. (4) Low hills and plains, further divided into nine regions: Northeast Plain, Changbai Hills, North China Plain, Shandong Hills, Yangtze Plain, Jiangnan Hills, Southeast Hills, Basins, and Taiwan and Hainan Island.</p>
<p>This map was carefully planned by the editors, but it is unavoidable that there are still omissions. Now, based on my limited observations, there are approximately two points:</p>
<p>First, the Xukong, Yunnan-Burma, Jijiang, Chengdu, Hainan Island, Kaifeng small railroads, and other railroads were not indicated.</p>
<p>Second, the provincial boundaries at the junction of Sichuan and Yunnan are missing. (Written by Wang Bangzhen, published by Commercial Press)</p>
<h3>Modern Geometry (Written by Wang Bangzhen, Published by Commercial Press)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chengji</p>
<p>Geometry, as a discipline, was highly developed in ancient Greece, but after the fifth century, there was no significant progress. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that modern geometry flourished, and many ingenious and beautiful theorems emerged one after another. Like exotic flowers blooming profusely, it was the height of its glory. Many middle school students are very interested in this, but they often suffer from not being able to obtain suitable books for research. Although there are only a few books on modern geometry in China, most of them are not suitable for the level and interest of Chinese students. Since I saw Mr. Wang Bangzhen's book, I felt like I had discovered an oasis in the desert!</p>
<p>This book strives for simple explanations. Anyone who has completed a basic geometry course can continue reading. The entire book is divided into eleven chapters: 1. Barycenter, 2. Triangle, 3. Concurrency and Collinearity, 4. Harmonic Division, 5. Pole and Polar, 6. Center of Similarity, 7. Coaxial Circles and Orthogonal Circles, 8. Inversion, 9. Cross Ratio, 10. Principle of Duality, 11. Recent Triangle Geometry. In just over one hundred and sixty pages, the entire content of modern geometry is concisely presented, allowing readers to gain a complete and clear overview with minimal effort. After reading this book, when you read other more advanced geometry books, you can handle them with ease and without any difficulty.</p>
<p>This book is based on Godfrey &amp; Siddous’ “Modern Geometry.” The original book by these two authors is extremely popular in England, and Mr. Wang Bangzhen’s book has even surpassed the former in some aspects: he has collected many famous problems (such as Talbot's Theorem and Malfatti's Problem), which are very wonderful and not found in general books.</p>
<p>In addition, the figures in the book are also very exquisite, unlike generally poorly printed books that make people lose their appetite at first sight.</p>
<p>For those who are already very interested in geometry but cannot find suitable books, I would like to solemnly recommend this book to them.</p>
<h3>Special Publication on Basic Education</h3>

<h3>History of the Hongmen</h3>
<p>— Edited by Lu Danlin and Zhu Lin, published by Zhonghua Book Company</p>
<p>Paperback, 32mo, one volume, price: 4 yuan</p>
<p>The organization of secret societies has always been secretive. Their members must strictly keep the contents of the organization secret. If any member leaks information to the outside world, they will be subject to the most severe punishment (the fifth prohibition in the Ten Prohibitions states: "After joining the Hongmen, members must not privately share the society's regulations with outsiders; those who violate this will be executed." The sixth of the Twenty-One Rules states: "Those who privately show ritual books and membership certificates to outsiders will have their ears cut off and receive one hundred and eight strokes of the cane." The eighth rule states: "Those who report society matters to outsiders will have their ears cut off and receive seventy-two strokes of the cane."). Therefore, they all strictly maintain secrecy. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Commercial Press published "The History of Chinese Secret Societies" by Hirayama Zhou, which combined the Bailian Society, the Tiandihui, the Sanhehui, the Gelaohui, the Xingzhonghui, the Guangfu Gonghui, etc. into a book. Although his materials were incomplete, the contents of secret societies, which had always been regarded as secret, were made public for the first time. In the twenty-fourth year, the "Historical Materials of Modern Secret Societies" edited and printed by Xiao Yushan had more pictures and texts, and the content was also more abundant. Last year, Master Wei Da wrote "Chinese Gangs," which was also written in great detail. There are also several other books about gangs, but the content is largely the same.</p>
<p>Zhu Lin's "History of the Hongmen" focuses on the content of the Hongmen, especially the materials on secret language, code words, common slang, membership procedures, various examinations, mountain opening ceremonies, altar order, commands, and classified regulations, which are relatively detailed. It enables people who study the various rituals and secret language of the Hongmen to understand them in detail. Moreover, from those commands, one can understand their thoughts. This is practical material for studying secret societies. At the same time, it reflects the deep intentions behind their compilation of these commands and secret language, which is a unique perspective that transcends the thinking and actions of general scholar-officials at the time.</p>
<p>However, the book has a major shortcoming, that is, in citing materials about the revolutionary movement of the Xingzhonghui and its relationship with the Hongmen, the author seems to be very unfamiliar with the history of the Kuomintang. For example, he said that the National Father "lived in Java, in the Nanyang, and was a Christian." This is contrary to the facts. There is no basis for the so-called living in Java. Even being a Christian was started by the National Father, and the National Father's elder brother, De Zhang, was also not a Christian. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the National Father began to reorganize the Zhi Gong Tang in San Francisco and revise its constitution. However, the author of this book said that he "met the leader of the Sanhehui, Zheng Shiliang, in Honolulu, who introduced him to join the society, reorganized the Zhi Gong Tang, and founded the Xingzhonghui... and then sent members Zheng Bichen, Lu Haodong, Chen Shaobai, Chen Zonggui, Yang Feihong... and others to various places to unite comrades and visit heroes..." This is contrary to the facts. Zheng Shiliang was the National Father’s classmate when he studied medicine at the Boji Hospital in Guangzhou. Bichen was Shiliang's alias. Yang Feihong (Hong) was Yang Quyun, who met the National Father in Hong Kong. Lu Haoche died for his country as early as the twenty-first year of Guangxu (1895), and Yang Quyun was also assassinated by Qing officials' spies in Hong Kong after the Huizhou Uprising in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900). How could they participate in the work of reorganizing the Zhi Gong Tang eight years before the Republic of China? Moreover, Zheng Bichen, Lu Haodong, Yang Quyun, and others had never been to Honolulu. The Xingzhonghui's first uprising was in the twenty-first year of Guangxu (1895), and the location was Guangzhou, not Huizhou. Those who died in this uprising were Lu Haodong, Zhu Guiquan, and Qiu Si, among others. Cheng Yaochen was arrested and died in the Dayou Cang. More than sixty others who were arrested were all labeled as foolish people who were misled and were dispersed separately. However, the author of this book said that members Chen Zonggui, Li Yaju, Yang Feihong, You Xiangshan, etc. died for their country. I don't know what the basis is. (Note: Lu Haodong's name is Zhonggui, but the author of this book says it is Chen Zonggui. I don't know if it's one person or two.)</p>
<p>Regarding the Xingzhonghui's constitution, it does not use the constitution of the initial organization in Honolulu, but uses the Hong Kong Xingzhonghui constitution, and it is not noted why? The key resolutions and clauses of the new constitution revised by the Zhi Gong Tang in San Francisco are important documents after the reorganization of the Zhi Gong Tang and were drafted by the National Father himself. The author of this book omitted it and did not include it, which is a bit of a pity.</p>
<p>If this book can rewrite and add the historical facts of the combination of the Xingzhonghui, the Tongmenghui, and the Hongmen, the predecessors of the Kuomintang, it would be a more detailed and精详 historical material on the History of the Hongmen. I would like to bring this up specifically, hoping that the author and readers of this book will pay attention to it and know the errors and omissions in this book.</p>

<h3>Miss Qingxia's Fund for the Poor, Widowed, and Sick: Mr. Jinhua Feng Generously Donates 5 Million Yuan. This Column Respectfully Expresses Our Respects on Behalf of Numerous Suffering Compatriots.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from reader Mr. Jinhua Sheng, along with 5 million yuan in legal tender. He said in his letter: "Your newspaper's Qingxia Relief Association is benefiting the poor and sick, which is truly significant. I serve in the business world and cannot be called wealthy, but I can still live a warm and full life. Seeing countless suffering compatriots, how can I sit idly by? I am willing to donate all of the 5 million yuan I have saved to the Qingxia Relief Association to help suffering compatriots. I hope you will accept it." We express our heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Jin's righteous act, and we also congratulate the countless compatriots who are struggling in difficult circumstances. The Qingxia Relief Association has been awarded fifteen times from last year to now. Due to changes in currency values, the amount issued has increased each time, and the number of applicants has also gradually increased. Therefore, many people feel disappointed each time. Of course, we also have unspeakable difficulties. We hope that enthusiastic people will give us more continuous assistance.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor: Questioning Zhabei Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>To the Honorable Editors: We, the residents of No. 4 Da Li, Shanyin Road, North Sichuan Road, live together with relatives in one house. Since the summer, the water pressure of tap water in each household in the area has been insufficient. On weekdays, after 6:00 AM, the third-floor faucets do not drip water at all. By 7:00 AM, the second floor also has no water, and only the first floor has water. At noon, water only trickles out. It is not until 11:00 PM or 12:00 AM that the second floor gradually has water, and the third floor must wait until 1:00 or 2:00 AM after midnight to have water. Daily water use must be carried up, which is extremely difficult! However, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's water and electricity charges are more expensive than those of the British-owned water and electricity company. Now, we see reports that prices will rise again. What is the reason? Such public utilities only know about money and do not care about morals. Not only do they not seek improvement, but they are also regressing day by day. For the sake of the public interest, the government should take them over and run them publicly. Otherwise, they must be severely warned not to raise prices in order to protect the rights and interests of citizens. We have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice. We hope that you will publish an abstract to make public opinion known. Sincerely, Zhang Qiqu, Qu Goupei, and Ji Yifei, residents of No. 21, No. 4 Da Li, September 16th.</p>

<h3>Miss Wang Danfeng's New Fashion: Wearing a Sleeveless Outerwear</h3>
<p>— Feng Qiuping</p>
<p>Ordinary vests, without careful consideration of the armholes, often lack beauty. This vest's structure is uniquely designed. The two edges of the armholes are inlaid with lace, maintaining the balance of the entire garment. The folds at the waist further accentuate the slender waist, resembling willow branches. As a result, the hem expands, ethereal and enchanting, with a captivating charm. Using white and red straight stripes creates a striking and eye-catching effect. Whether worn over a shirt or a cheongsam, it is the ideal outerwear for young women!</p>
<p>Materials</p>
<p>Empress brand fine wool, four strands of red and four strands of light color.</p>
<p>Beginning</p>
<p>Starting from the right front panel, cast on 120 stitches horizontally. Knit nine rows in garter stitch using the light color, then switch to red and knit five rows. In the stockinette stitch, increase one stitch every two rows. The neckline is semi-circular, with a shoulder width of three and a half inches. Knit one inch in garter stitch. The left front panel is the same as the right.</p>
<p>Back Panel</p>
<p>Back Panel</p>
<p>From the hem to the armhole, cast on 88 stitches horizontally. Knit two rows in garter stitch in red, nine rows in light color, and then increase for the armhole, increasing one stitch every other row until there are five stitches increased. Knit four inches in garter stitch. The back width is seventeen inches. On the left armhole, decrease one stitch every other row. Decrease five stitches, knit two rows in garter stitch in red, nine rows in light color, returning to the original 88 stitches. Bind off in one row and sew together with the front panels. Crochet around the four sides with three-stitch rows, using red thread. Crochet the neckline with light-colored wood ear stitch for one row.</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between Woolen Thread and Knitting</h3>
<p>— Feng Qiuping</p>
<p>Woolen thread was initially imported from Europe and the West. Because of its ability to innovate and bring forth new ideas, the Chinese people universally enjoy using it.</p>
<p>Recognizing the enormous outflow of wealth over the years, the Chinese people, in order to reclaim rights and benefits, created and sold domestic products to compete with imported goods. They invested heavily, established factories on their own, and spared no effort to concentrate the three major principles of financial resources, material resources, and human resources. Through diligent operation and striving for perfection, they have reached the present day, standing tall as the leading woolen thread industry in the world. This success is not accidental.</p>
<p>At that time, the art of knitting was still moving at a snail's pace, stuck in its old ways. This humble author, recognizing the growing need for knitted products, advocated tirelessly, founded knitting schools to select new talents, edited knitting books, or taught in the air, disclosing knowledge to people and providing it to enthusiasts. For more than ten years, I have worked diligently and have been deeply loved by ladies in society, for which I am truly ashamed. The number of graduates from all sessions is no less than a thousand, almost all over Shanghai. This is naturally due to the Chinese people's foresight in loving and using domestic goods. The relationship between knitting and woolen thread seems to be mutually related, with different tunes but the same melody. The focus is on this.</p>
<p>In recent years, the art of knitting has been changing with each passing day, catering to the times. Everything from women's fashion coats and cheongsams to children's clothing is widely selected. Therefore, domestic woolen thread is also selling well throughout the country, with supply falling short of demand. This must be attributed to the development of the art of knitting.</p>
<p>And the art of knitting is constantly improving. At this time of national mobilization, saving woolen thread is essential and meets the requirements of frugality. Therefore, the future path is truly unlimited.</p>

<p>Ouyang Shafei's Wool Wrapped New Outfit</p>
<p>This atomic flower shawl vest is the first new work of the 1948 style. For detailed knitting methods and instructions, please refer to the "Knitting Special Issue" edited by Ms. Qiu Yang, which will be published soon. This publication is widely distributed by major woolen thread stores to provide for those who love knitting. Please pay special attention to all sectors.</p>
<h3>Li Huifang's Woolen Thread New Outfit: Miss Li Huifang's Auspicious Ruyi Patterned Padded Jacket</h3>
<p>— Chen Hongyan</p>
<p>The great waves of the times are forever moving forward. Last year, a type of short padded jacket was popular in Shanghai, becoming the only adornment for fashionable ladies. Our knitting world stands at the forefront of the times, so in order to promote art, we dare not lag behind, and we are constantly researching and have successfully remade woolen thread. Looking at the curves and contours in the image, how clearly they are divided. The ruyi pattern inlaid with beautiful designs, antique and fragrant, fully expresses the conditions of generosity and elegance. Moreover, it has a particularly strong ability to keep warm, making it the ideal woolen thread padded jacket for beauty-loving ladies.</p>
<p>Front Panel</p>
<p>Cast on 124 stitches, the waist shaping method is the same as the back panel. The opening of the lapel is done like a cheongsam. Make a round neckline. First increase on the left. The length of the half sleeve should be the same as the back panel. Sew together with embroidery needle. See pages 86 of the thirteenth to sixteenth volumes.</p>
<p>Sleeve: Cast on 5 stitches horizontally. On the second row, increase 6 stitches in one row. In the third row, add 7 stitches, and in the fourth row, add 8 stitches. Increase the stitches in sequence. A total of 90 stitches are increased. Knit 6 inches long. Decrease the stitches according to the number of stitches increased, until there are 5 stitches left. Sew up the sleeve and attach it. The second sleeve is the same.</p>
<p>Ruyi Pattern: First, crochet one row around the four sides of the garment, three stitches long, using dark thread for the border. Then, crochet short stitches in the second row. Braid the corners of the garment, and coil the ruyi pattern on the neckline and front of the chest.</p>
