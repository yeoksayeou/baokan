<h3>朱家驊發戈談話指責蘇外長建議　青年黨亦發戈鄭重聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十二日電〕聯合國中國同志會理事長朱家驊，今就蘇外畏建議在莫斯科會議討論中國問題一事，發表談話稱，此次世界大戰，中國加入最早，盡力亦大，當一九四五年秋問日本將投降之前，蘇聯尙作日本調人，向盟國要求有條件投降，今日乃對最忠實盟友之中國，竟有此汚辱舉動，違法侵權，莫此為甚于！世間不平之事，寗有過於此者。外長會議未邀請中國參與，已屬違反波茨坦協定，至討論中國問題一事，更違反聯合國憲章云。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國靑年黨昨為蘇聯外長莫洛托夫提議將「中國問題」列入四國外長會議議程事，發表鄭重聲明，原文如下：</p>
<p>「中國為一經過八年苦鬥，卒使日本法西斯陷於顚覆之國家，其在遠東所處之地位，實有掩護其盟邦，毫無顧慮以與東西各怯西斯國家作殊死奮鬥，而卒底於成功之勞績其所取得一獨立國家，幷列入世界五强之一的資格，實不容任何國家予以侵犯或損害。　吾人願指出中國目前的局勢，實有其極不愉快之國際背景，吾人不期待任何國際力量，為吾人解紛，吾人惟希望國際對中國當前的情况，不予以助長與權　。質言之，即除國際因素，中國自身之事中國人能自了之，初不勞友邦之過慮。「因此吾人對美英蘇三國在莫斯科外長會議以外之任何商談，無論其性質為善意的，抑為非善意的，其形式為公開的，抑為秘密的，吾人以一獨立國家之資裕，決無受其拘束之義務」。</p>
<h3>反對千預內政各地羣情憤慨　〔本報十三日南京電〕為反對蘇外畏干預我內政之難議，首都各界羣情憤慨。蔣主席及外交部並接獲廣州，保定，合肥等地參議會學生界及民衆團體之通電，堅決支持政府，維護主權，首都及各地學生均準備舉行護權愛國大游行。</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊」上海市商會，總工會，市農會，婦女會，市敎育會等團體，代表滬市四百萬市民，十二日聯電外部請轉草斯科四國外長會議，作嚴正之聲明，堅決反對無論其爲會內的或會外喲討論中國問題並促其認淸中國民氣之不可侮。此外並通電全國同胞一致響應，奮起維護國格曁主權。</p>
<h3>非正式討論強國問題　蘇同意邀我列席</h3>
<p>莫洛托夫通知美英外長　若干立委建議政府參加外長會議</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十三日電〕莫洛托夫今日通知馬歇爾與貝文，同意在會議外非正式討論中國問題，並亦同意由中國代表列席、按馬歇爾之建議此項談判，應與外長會議毫無關聯，且在談判結束後，亦不發表任何公報。會談內容僅限於檢討一九四五年三國莫斯科協定之執行。據美方消息稱，莫洛托夫之通知中，並未提及討論中國問題之日期以及討論結束後是否發表公報事。僉信蘇聯在中國問題仍獲勝利。蓋中國問題雖未列入該程，而三强旣加以討論，蘇聯即可向美國提出遠東政策之質詢，此即蘇聯之目的也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕聞若手立委將提一建議案，核據當年菠茨坦會議決議案，建議政府。要求加入外長會議。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕今日此間對馬歇爾拒絕莫洛托夫之建議，將中國問題列入外長會議正式議程一節，甚表欣慰。華府某晚報，大標題為「列强阻止蘇聯討論中國問題。」據今日此間接獲莫斯科美方廣播訊，馬歇爾昨繼莫洛托夫建議討論中國問題後，曾與華勝取得接觸。又悉，顧維鈞大使，曾與美副國務卿艾克遜舉行談話。</p>
<h3>美報反對干涉中國</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十二日電〕霍華德系報紙之世界電訊報，今日以「干涉中國」為題，撰述社論，反對三國於莫斯科非正式討論中國問題。該報稱，三國對華干涉，將導引另一次世界大戰。</p>
<p>〔又電〕紐約時報今著論讚揚三强之拒絕莫洛托夫之建議，不在中國未參加之會中討論中國問題。文中稱，如應允蘇外長之要求，則對列居五强之一及安理會常任理事國之國家，為無理之侮辱。前次未經中國參加之事已過多，不容再有不經中國參加而討論中國問題之事發生。按史達林即係在蘇領士雅爾達，强迫羅斯福邱吉爾二氏，秘密承認在中國東北之所獲，而為蘇聯參加對日戰爭之最後代價者。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾之聲明蘇報均未刊載</h3>
<p>延安電台指責美國</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科十二日電〕本日此間各報均未刋載馬歇爾昨在莫斯科會議所作關於中國問題之聲明。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十三日電〕延安電台十三日引解放日報之社評稱：「本屆莫斯科會護定有成就，反動份子無論使用何種手段，必趨失敗」。延安廣播中將美國之對華比諸希特勒之於西班牙。</p>

<h3>中央委會接受我建議　聯總購棉花運華　救濟中國計劃繼續進行</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕聯總署長魯克斯本日宣佈：中央委員會業已接受中國提出以救濟中國計劃內用途尙未規定之款項，購買棉花之建議，並授權中國政府，運用自棉花方面之所得</p>
<p>，協助聯總其他接濟物資之分配。聯總之接受，係由於聯總遠東委員會就地與中國政府及　總分署會商後建議，加以接受者。棉花之購買，將視款項而定，其中並規定，如屬必要，遠東委會得聯總分署同意後，可准許免費分配之工作，自三月十五日起，寬緩六週。魯克斯繼稱：聯總可能額外供給中國價値約達五百萬美元之棉花，美國接濟中國之棉花，巳規定爲十三千八百”十公噸，價値五千三百六十二萬六千美元，其中已有八萬一千六百五十一公噸運貨，價値三千九百七十萬美元，八千二百二十噸正裝運中，四五月份將裝運者，為一萬三千九百十七噸。聯總職員告記者稱：巴西·印度·亦有運棉去華計劃，唯官方數字尙未發表。魯克斯謂：依據國務院命令，聯總所有運華物資，必須於五月三十一日交於零售商，除五百萬美元之額外棉花外，可能尙購價値一千萬美元棉花運華。救濟中國計劃，因開始較晚，以及中國八年戰爭以來，支配制度之陷於停頓，而遭受嚴重阳礙。魯氏謂：由於中國之財政情勢，山國政府必須自本身財源，而非出售食物醫藥用品等接濟物資之所得中，籌措巨款，支持分配工作。中國政府前已向聯總表示，同意以價値等於全部棉花百分之四十五價値之棉布棉花，免費分配予貧民，中國政府已要求寬緩此等規定工作，俾籌措分配其他救濟物着須用之款項。聯總一般救濟工作計劃，已完成百分之八十五，救濟中國計劃開始較晚，僅完成百分之六十六，將繼續進行。</p>
<p>運往中共區物資增加</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕魯克斯斯答覆質問時稱：在中國常地之行總「仍在設法救濟中共，並獲一部份成功。」渠稱：本年一月份運往中國共黨控制區之物資較之以前任何一時期為多，其中有醫藥供應品與衣服共計五百噸。此等供應品，並非由飛機在空中擲下，其他醫藥供應品短時期亦曾用此種空運之方法。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕台灣旅京滬六團體代表楊肇喜。陳碧笙等十三人，前因台灣二二八事件，曾自動請政府予以交通上方便、赴台一行，以協助政府宣慰台胞，解決事變，當於十一日專機飛台，然因計劃與事實有所出入，乃於十二日忽促返京。抵京一日間，未與政府當局接洽，頃於十三日下午四時，招待記者，報告台灣實况及此行經過。茲誌其要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）赴台動機　出發前曾兩度晤白祟禧，商談台事，要求以决數點；（甲）請廢除特殊化之行政長官制，改省府制。（乙）取銷專賣制度，取銷省營貿易。（丙）撒換陳儀，懲辦貪污官吏。（丁）不要派兵赴台，以武力對付台胞。白氏當時答以派兵赴台，係國家國防問題，決不以武力對付台人。政治上之特殊化長官制，允撒銷；專賣制亦可撒銷。對陳儀之長台，出此大事，陳不能再留台，因此數條件，均經政府接受，故決赴台一行。</p>
<p>（二）來往行程　十一日午後專機過滬飛台，抵達時為下午五時一刻，至旅社休息時，為下午五時三刻，即與台胞接觸晤談。惟至當晚七時三刻起，即為行政長官公署所派憲兵包圍，失却與外間連繫之自由。旋由國防部所派同往之何師長與公署接洽結果，陳儀表示不能保護代表團之安全，彼等當夜計議，決於十二日從速返京，再作計議。十二日下午三時許即抵京。</p>
<p>（三）台立方米實況　二二八事件後，至本月今日前，台北均在民衆控制中，外省人不能出門。八日後則反是，當局採取鎮壓。台北以外，政府以飛機運兵前往。以全台計，政府可控制者有七個城市，故如政府以武力岡解決事件，短期內不可能達成。</p>
<p>（四）事件內情　一言以蔽之，此次事件係人民對政治不可壓制的一種反抗，以一年餘生活上之失望，對官吏仇恨已極，至此乃總爆發。此外，尙有一最大動力，即剛自海南島返台過去被日人强征之壮丁五萬餘人參加行動。此五萬餘人，在台北中南各地分佈，此次實為民衆與壯丁之配合。</p>
<p>（五）陳儀作風　陳氏近曾擬定三年施政計劃，且決定將台憲政實施時期，延長至民卅八年，因如實施憲政，省長民選，陳即不能當選。在軍事上，陳自　警備司令，過去政府曾派七十軍駐台，然非陳部，故用變相擴軍辦法，擴大警察大隊，成立三大隊之組織，一隊計一千八百人。同時加强緝私警察，如專賣局警察，貿易局警察，另成立一特務團，陳欲以此為其私人武力，成為變相軍隊。然當二二八事件後，以警大隊不能作戰，故對民衆要求，幾全部接收，連公署職權，幾均無法推行，而由公署派員與民衆組織處理委會負其責。迨至國軍一至，陳氏能度立即變化，所有允諾，全部推翻，且將處理委會解散。</p>
<p>（六）希望政府亟望政府能答應我等要求，實行諾言，如主席之宣示能即時實現，則台事可即結束。</p>
<p>（七）今後動向盼能謁見主席，報告此事，並盼主席能實行諾言。最後楊等循記者問稱：必先調回陳儀，再使白去，則大勢可定。</p>
<p>〔又電〕台代表陳碧筆十三日在記者會中稱：報載旅香港台胞主張電聯合國會議，要求台省為聯合國委任統治地一事，吾信台人決無此意，台省欲求進步與改革，必須為中華民國領土之一部份，決不能離開中華民國。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>杜魯門總的警告！</h3>
<p>當英蘇兩外長在莫斯科會議席上爭論到面紅耳赤的時侯，杜魯門總統正向美國國會發表驚人演說，率直以「世界和平與美國安全因蘇聯全能主義之勃興而感受威脅」，警告美國人民以及全世界愛好和平的各國人民。不僅使我們對於莫斯科外長會議所懷有的滿腔熱望，受一嚴重的打擊；而且使我們對於戰後國際政局的遠景，也不敢過份樂觀了。</p>
<p>記得去年十二月問四國外長在紐約舉行會議時，會塲內的空氣是何等的融洽！尤其在美蘇兩國之間，大有化戾氣為祥和的可能，最後並決定至今日在莫斯科四國外長會議，起草對德對奧和的；當時一般國際觀察家，莫不為世界和平額手慶祝，咸以為戰後擾攘不定的世界政局終究獲得了平靜的歸趨，，而對於一九四七年的國際政治，尤其對於今日在莫斯科舉行的四國外長會議，懷着滿腔的熱望，預料眞正的和平在這一年內必能締造成功．殊不料到了莫斯科會議開慕之後，莫洛托夫首先提出中國問題，以致引起了國際上的軒然大波；接着又在第二次會議中，對於德境英國佔領區內的行政，恣意加以攻擊，使英國外相貝文不得不反唇相譏，乃造成第三次會議的一塲舌戰。由此使世人對於蘇聯發生了一個非常惡劣的印象，大家都認為，蘇聯在口頭上雖然也高叫着世界和平，但其實際行動，並不走向世界和平之路；大家都以為，蘇聯在口頭上雖然已高呼民主，但是按之實際，仍保留她的全能政體。所以杜魯門總統發表這種演說，並不是無的放矢，而是有感而發的。</p>
<p>我們閱議美國合衆社發表的杜魯門總統演說的全文，綜合起來，有下列數項要點；（一）世界和平與美國安全因蘇聯全能主義的勃興而感受威脅，故美國應立卽以軍械金錢及軍事顧問送往希臘土耳其，以應付共產主義在該兩國內之挑釁。（二）美國政策之初步目的，乃在維持希臘現行政府，使其仍為巴爾幹半島反對共產主義之最後堡壘，否則共產主義將蔓延及中束，後患幾將不堪設想。（三）美國若不能及時援助希臘與士耳共，則其後果將影響及西方；卽在束方，亦將受其影響，故吾人應立卽採取堅決行動。（四）若干國家之人民最近已受全能政體之統治，而此種全能政體，係遠背其意志而以武力强迫加諸彼等者。某國竟不惜遠背雅爾達協定，輒向若干國家尤其是保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，波蘭三國，施行脅迫及恫嚇，美國政府無不提出抗議。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統在演辭內，雖未直接指出蘇聯，但係針對蘇聯而發，是不能諱言的。杜魯門總統發表這樣强硬的外交聲明，在其就任總統以來，還是破天荒第一次，而且無論如何解釋，在莫斯科看來，終不是一種友好的表示。因此我們要問，杜魯門總統爲什麽敢發表這強硬的外交演說？難道不怕美蘇關係惡化嗎？關於前者，我們認爲理由很簡單，因爲杜魯門總統相信，美國全國的人民，都和他抱着類似的見解，對於他所發表的外交政策，一定能做他的後盾，所以他有持無恐。至於後者，杜魯門總統爲世界和平計，同時也爲美國的安全計，內心也非常願意與蘇聯通力合作，共同締造世界和平；同時並相信，戰後四強若仍能保持戰時駢肩作戰的精神，則締造和平無、有不成功者；而目前的世界政局所以如此動亂不安，不得不歸罪蘇聯。戰後蘇聯不僅在歐洲懷有野心；就是在遠東，也有其企圖；凡為蘇聯勢力所及的地方，都有她的「鐵幕」。因此英美對付蘇聯，也只有兩種辦法可取了：一是採取綏靖政策，處處滿足蘇聯的要求，以換得蘇聯的合作；另是採取强硬政策，使其有所戒懼，不敢越雷池一步。觀於戰前英國首柑張伯倫對德採取綏靖政策的失敗，可知杜魯們總統決不願重蹈覆轍的。按之美國國內的輿情，美國大多數人民都不贊成對於蘇聯採取綏靖政策的；而且認為綏靖政策徒然增高其慾望，與事有害無益。反之，採取強硬政策，固有使美蘇關係惡化的可能，但是蘇聯的外交政策，最講究現實主義，而將國際關係，視為力的平衡，故對於美國的警告，不能不加以重視，而重行考慮其態度。一</p>
<p>所以我們認為社魯門總統的演說，雖足以成為美蘇關係惡化的因素，但是要使蘇聯改變其外交作風，唯有美國採取此種態度。據美國聯合社莫斯科電訊，莫洛托夫獲悉杜魯門總統演說之後，在外長會議席上的態度，已趨於緩和；對於英國外相，也已作許多讓步，這個電訊如果屬實，則足以證明杜魯門總統的抉擇，是非常賢明的了。</p>
<p>要之，莫斯科會議開幕之後，卽引起國際上的軒然大波，實在是一件不幸之事。人類渴望和平已久，對於這次外長會議的期望，更為殷切；但是會議一經開幕，就引起國際上的軒然大波，怎能不教我們痛心疾首呢？杜魯門總統已發出警告了，凡是愛好和平的人們，却應該團結起來，保衛世界和平，不再受任何全能政體的威脅；同時蘇聯也應該重加考慮，深切反省，旣欲世界保持和平，在任何國際會議中，就應該秉有忍讓的精神，從大處着眼，謀得國際間的協調，從而完成締造世界和平的偉業。這次外長會議對於世界的安危與人類的禍福，關係實在太重大了；我們早已說過，這次國際會議，只許成功，不許失敗；而今成敗的關鍵，完全操在蘇聯的手裏，所以我們竭誠希望蘇聯對於杜魯門總統的警告，深切反省，改變態度！不獨為世界之幸，抑且亦為蘇聯之福！</p>

<h3>限制蘇聯勢力繼續擴張　美轉取強硬外交　馬歇爾將直接會晤史達林</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播：據美權威方面消崽，馬歇爾已奉命在外長會議中對蘇聯採取更爲强硬之政策，杜魯門總統在國會之演詞，即爲此事之明證。</p>
<p>〔合衆社〕（斯科十三日電）據此間悉：馬歇爾不久將會晤史達林，解釋美國之新政策。然馬歇爾是否將主動請求會晤，或等候克里姆林宮之邀請，則尚未決定。克里姆林設宴款待外賓時，亦爲會談之機會，祗少可由此約定正式之晤談。各方均在探詢「此事對外長會議可能發生何種影響」。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕杜魯門總統及貝文外相今日同在華盛頓及莫斯科發表指責蘇聯在東歐及德境活動的演說，此乃戰後英美兩國最强硬的表示。不論其同時發表是否偶然巧合，然其聯合的效果，乃爲昭告世界，英美兩國」不廿坐視矣。杜魯門向國會之要求，不啻表示美國祗許蘇聯之勢力範圍，止於希臘土耳其兩國邊界。渠更指責蘇聯在其勢力圈內，向波羅保等國强迫其接受極權政權。貝文在莫斯科會議中，更當莫洛托夫之面，直指蘇聯未嘗履行波茨坦協定。今應注意者，乃爲英美兩大巨頭之言論對於莫斯科會議將有何釋影響。倫敦外交觀察家認杜魯門之演辭，可以顯示美國自馬歇爾出兵國務卿後，其外交政策益趨强硬，以三項新原則爲其基礎：（一）美國自認爲世界領導强國，今後行履行其責任，不再假手他國如英國等。（二）美國之初步方法，乃經濟及財政援助，總統曾指　　項援助廣泛解釋，故其他援助方式亦可採取。（三）美國的基本政策爲援助自由人民，反　　人的武大總治或外界的壓力。</p>

<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十二日電〕今日四國外長會議，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫首决採取守勢，接受英外相貝文之要求，允予宣佈蘇聯所拘禁之德戰俘人數，並承認蘇聯並未「完全破壞」德國之主力艦，但否認蘇聯拘有三百萬戰俘一說。申言確數須待各盟國同時宣佈後，始能予以透露。其他三國外長對此皆表同意。英外相貝文所發表之演說，歷時四十五分鐘，所提各項要求，莫洛托夫並未全部加以答覆。貝文並辯護在佔領區內扣押工廠設備一事，主張先需使德國在經濟上趨於統一，其言與馬歇爾昨日所表示者相同。茲分誌貝文在演說中所提各項要求如次：（一）各盟國應宣佈所拘德國俘虜之確數；（二）宣佈何時可使之各返家鄉；（三）四國前已同意破壞德國主力艦，今遲遲未見蘇聯遵行，應請其解釋理由；（四）蘇聯在佔領區內移走之之業設備，其種類請予說明；（五）蘇聯佔領區內，目前生產比數如何；（六）蘇聯佔領區之德國工業，蘇聯所接收者已有若干；（七）盟國所定一九四六年三月後之德國平時經濟標準計劃已予作廢。貝文演說後，馬歇爾亦繼起發曾，對此皆表同意。</p>

<h3>美國採取外交新路綫　杜魯門演說要點</h3>
<p>總統力促國會准予撥款四億美元援助希土兩國並以其他方式協助其復興，藉以扶助自由民族，抵抗外來威迫……。（全文見明日本報第七版）</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門總統今日向參衆兩院聯席會議上致詞，籲請美國人民利用金錢，物資及兵力制止世界共產主義之前進。總統雖未直指蘇聯，但其意義甚爲明顯。渠提出一外交新政策，特別要求國會撥款四億美元援助希臘及土耳其二國。杜氏並稱：必要時，決不猶豫再請撥款，用於協助自由民族保持國家統一，以防侵略者企圖將極權政體强其接受。吾人現處於世界領袖地位，苟稍購躇，或將危及世界和平，且無疑將危及吾人自身之福利。總統建議四點如下：（一）准予撥款四億美元援助希臘及土耳其至一九四八年六月三十日爲止；（二）授權政府派遣文官與軍人前往該二國協助復興，並監督該款用途；（三）通過法案授權政府，自由使用該款，務期以最帶且最有效方法利用日用必需品及其他供應與配備等；（四）授權政府敎育並訓練希土二國之選拔人員。最後一點即指在美國受軍事訓練，如同上决大戰時英國軍事顧問團然。總統演說時議員曾三度報以歡呼。一次在其促請注意援助款項應予監督使用時，二次在其政撃極權政體時，又一次則在其稱苟不加以援助，局勢　更嚴重之時。據共和黨副領袖參議員韋萊許論稱：此項演說無異爲對極權主義勢力之宣戰文告，但舍是以外似無他途可循。</p>
<p>華府反響　〔路透社華盛頓十二日電〕杜魯門演辭之發表，正値外交關係因蘇聯駐英美大使之被召而達異常緊張狀態之際。總統雖未直指蘇聯之名，但其「不得以脅迫式政治溶入的方法强迫變更目前之此界政局」之嚴重警告，顯然係針對蘇聯而發。總統使用最强有力之言辭，證責蘇聯違反雅爾達協定，不顧波蘭，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞人民之意志，強迫彼等接受極權政權之統治。前輩觀察家指出故羅斯福總統曾於二次世界大戰爆發前，用類似的名辭，抨擊希特勒。杜魯門總統此次特別指出德日戰時的現象已重見於今日，其意實爲將蘇聯對其鄰國所施之外交方策，與德日之政策列入同類。猶憶一九三九－一九四〇年蘇聯芬蘭之戰時，羅斯福及邱吉爾均曾用類似之辭句，抨擊蘇聯之侵略政策杜魯門演辭中最重要之點，乃爲籲請國會在立法方面採取立刻而決斷的行動，以遏止蘇聯對世界某一特定部份的侵略及擴大政策。此項要求，實爲美國史上所未見。國會人士並稱：國會若批准杜魯門之要求，保障希臘及土耳其兩國之自由與完整，其性質將等於二次歐戰爆發前英國所給與羅馬尼亞及波蘭之保障。杜魯門及馬歇爾前此與國會領袖秘密晤談時，曾明白表示美國一旦於接受對外所負之責任後，決不再予放棄。除希土兩國以外，他國有受蘇聯外交政策之脅迫，以强制其人民接受親蘇極權政權之統治者，美國亦當給予同樣的保障。</p>
<p>國會人士見解　〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕國會方面對於杜魯門總統演說之反響，推崇與批評兼而有之。參議院議長兼該院外交委員會主席范登堡聲稱：「際此時期，吾人不能不對總統予以支援，雖在細則上尚有無數微妙問題須待國會決定。」范氏並稱：國會可在本月底有所決定，一如總統所要求者。但美國外交應採取全面政策，避免帝國主義，誠意履行聯合國憲章，且適合整個世界，俾在各地均能收穫同樣效果。</p>
<p>英希土表歡迎　〔合衆社倫敦十二日電〕關於杜魯門總統向國會所發表之演說，要求援助希臘與土耳其一事，英希土三國人士今夜一致表示熱烈歡迎，惟希臘左翼解放陣綫發言人則有不滿之論調，認爲美國此舉殆在代替「法西斯政權」干涉希臘之內政，並將加劇希臘之內戰云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十二日電〕消息靈通人士今日告聯合社記者稱：美國對蘇聯已推行一種新政策，此項政策適行於國務卿馬歇爾出席莫斯科外長會議之時，可謂巧保。美國政策並非欲破壞莫斯科會議，而欲昭示蘇聯人士，美國正採取一種新路綫，蘇聯如願循此路綫進行磋商，則主持其事者現方參加會議，即馬歇爾其人是。</p>
<p>葛羅米柯緘默　〔路透社紐約十三日電〕聯合國機構人士並不掩飾因杜魯門總統之演說而造成之嚴重局勢。蘇聯駐安理會代表葛羅米柯不願發表意見，而聯合國官員則認杜魯門此次演說顯示美國已承認局勢之極度嚴重，實已不容聯合國機構之處理。波蘭人士則覺困難的希臘局勢，將因杜魯門的舉動而更趨複雜，實屬不幸之至。民主黨參議員麥卡偷稱，「美國若干涉希臘土耳其意即戰爭」，共和黨領袖參議員搭夫特則曰，「不論對希臘之十涉爲如何，與蘇發生戰爭尚須視其他許多環境而定」。</p>
<p>杜魯門氏弗州　〔聯合社弗羅里達州凱惠斯特十二日電〕杜魯門總統今日在國會發表重要演說，甚感疲勞，已乘「聖牛」號飛機抵此海軍基地，作短期休息。總統現年六十二歲，共私人醫生葛最漢囑其作四日之散步，漢泳及日光浴，調劑身心，以備應付今後局勢。美國外交政策今後將遭連最嚴華之試鍊。總統下機時，記者間以，曾否接得報告，總統答稱：「絕無報告，余不知莫斯科或任何地點有何反響」。</p>

<h3>官商勾串舞弊操縱黃金　林鳳苞楊安仁被捕　暫準保釋辦完移交昨乘夜車晋京　詹蓮生將於今里解地院</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金潮案中當局「打老虎」之決心，現已有事實之表現。同豐餘金號經理兼上海市金集公會理事長詹蓮生，中央銀行前業務局長林鳳苞，前業務局副局長楊安仁等三人，利用央行分配　拋黃金，官商勾結，操縱舞弊，經監察委員提出彈劾後，蔣主席赫然震怒，於十二日傍晚電令淞滬警備司令部拘捕後送交法院辦理，常日深晚十一時詹等三人即被逮捕。林鳳苞與楊安仁兩人因央行業務尚未移交淸楚，經張羣與央行新總裁張嘉璈兩人面謁主席，請准暫予保釋，擔保俟移交辦妥後，自向法院投案，經主席允准，由侍從室於十三日以長途電話通知警備部，常將林等兩人暫予保釋。聞渠等已於昨晚偕同央行前總裁貝詒同車晋京。至詹蓮生則將於今晨解送地方法院，昨日警備部方面已將一切手續辦妥矣。</p>
<h3>警務部楊副司令談　勾串操縱內幕</h3>
<p>警備司令部楊副司令昨告記者此案詳情稱：關於林等勾串舞弊之事實，就已查明者：一爲中央銀行逐日暗售黃金之數量與代售行號賬册不蓋不實，以本年一月二十七日爲例，央行售與詹蓮生同豐餘者爲一八二〇條，而同豐餘賬載八二〇條，將其餘數分列於第二日或第三日，實留投機之罅隙，予操縱之機會。二爲中央銀行黃金原有客戶聲請單，後即廢除，由詹蓮生一人之私卓即可配購，其餘任何行號均須經詹手方可得購配金而詹蓮生所夥開之同　餘資本總額僅一千五百萬元，分十五股，詹得兩股，內中」股且係代友人出面者，其方人爲誰及其餘十二股之股東姓名未吐其實，以如此小額資金所組成之商號担任政府調節金融之大任，就一月二十三日至二月十五日止。配金達二萬餘條，其中勾串之事實至爲明顯。三爲央行停配之前一日，同豐餘購入黃金三百十三條之多，平時逢有金價上漲時，詹又利用親左或外圍組綠，私相授受，官商表裏相應，操縱黃金，絕無疑義。四爲中央銀行暗拋黃金亦由詹蓮生經手，但賬册內絕無記載，央行收入暗拋之價格與詹蓮生所轉手拋出之價格，是否相符，爲一大疑問。若非上下一體，何至兒戲若是。五爲泰康潤金號賬內有央行王麗其人於金價暴漲之前數日，購過黃金一百十四條，該明王麗係央行同人。據泰康潤經理謝秉泉供稱，向其他行號購進者或更多於此。央行業務局以自己經配之黃金售與自己化名購囤，應負一大責任。上述各端僅就其已查得實據而無可掩飾者而言，此外以案送法院，爲保持審理前之機密，未能發表。總之國家實施黃金政策原爲平抑物價，乃乘機利便與奸商同其鼻息，言之實堪痛心。現本案移送法院審理，將來必有詳情公報，本部對辦理林等一案，業已告一段落云。</p>

<h3>「官辦商行」大受人指摘　大量奢侈品進口價值數十萬美元　且傳係政府機關人員所定購</h3>
<p>〔合衆社本埠訊〕國營商行頃購有價値數十萬美元之進口貨，而絕不受中美私人商行自去年十一月以來所受結匯限額及進口條例等限制。據悉：一統公司，中央信託局及中國供應局，現正在將大量「奢侈品」搬運進口，如高價汽車，無綫電機，冰箱，及其他中國當局所嚴厲禁止進口之貨物，而私人商行數千件進口許可證及結匯之請求書，擬以急需之合法進口貨，如重工業器材等物，則爲當局置之不理。又據航運界人士證實，此項奢侈品，大部份爲政府有關之商行所定購，供應私人買戶，且傳係爲政府機關人員所定購，獲利以飽私囊。</p>
<p>中國商界人士指稱：一統公司係中央信託局之代理人，以低價定購外國貨物，轉售予私人商行時，徵收佣金百分之二·五，售予政府時，取佣金百分之一，中美商行因此獲利甚微，不敷開支，致難與「官辦」商行競爭。中美商人對於宋子良所主持之孚中公司，宋子安之中國建設銀公司及孔令侃之揚子建設公司，皆可利用「特權」經營商業等情，允多指摘之詞，例如孚中公司有代表一人，利用中國外交官之護照，現正在美國從事商業上之旅行，而一般有經騐之中國商界領袖，欲赴美國，則常不能獲得准許，最近華盛頓與紐約之美國商行，對上述「特權」商行，已曾向國務院提出抗議，指斥彼等利用政治及其他壓力，欲將外商排出中國，在華之美國商界領袖，雖多不願公開加以討論，但多數亦承認一月前所提抗議情形，現仍存在，幷認爲改善之希望極微云</p>

<h3>足籃球健將陸鍾恩　臺灣暴動目撃談　爲首暴徒均係遣歸台省浪人襲撃公共機關搗毀商店住戶</h3>

<p>西摩路大火案凟職部份起訴　消防員警廿三人犯兩項罪嫌</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案消防警凟職部份，業經地檢處沈檢察官偵查終結，分成兩案分別提起公訴。關於被告尚志魁，戴光榮，李成鈞，蔡治英（均在押）等四人，於餘火米熄時入二十七號竊取毛巾手帕等財物部份，以盜匪罪嫌起訴。關於被告黃寳琦（在押），李壎，朱慶瀾，周悅實，劉繼漢，趙榮江，黃克勤，王振山，楊阿寳，仝尊武，王松淸，湯長生，劉連壁，楊應善，羅靑，顧根福，王鐘秀，王鳳安，李阿山等十九人，則以公共危險及竊盜嫌疑罪起訴，茲將兩案起訴事實，理由及引用法條分誌如後：（一）被告尚志魁係宜昌路消防區隊警長，戴光榮係該區十一號消防警士，李成鈞係一〇八號消防警士，蔡治英係五八七號消防警士。本年一月二十二日晚九時三十分武定路四五二號銅匠作起火，延燒及六六〇弄全弄，至翌日上午十一時餘火未熄，消防區隊派尚志魁率戴光榮等三人前往火塲警戒，尚等四人乃乘機入該弄二十七號周秀珍家竊取財物，並迫令周企舫開啓箱上之鎖，任其刦掠。沈檢察官認爲周企舫當時迫於威力，且以衆寡懸殊，已達於不能抗拒之程度，參照大理院民國三年上字第二六二號判決，尚志魁等四被告實有刑法第一三四條上段，第三二一條第一項第五款與懲治盜匪行爲犯意一貫，其爲刑法第五十六條之迎續犯無疑，合依特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條第一項第二項前段，刑事訴訟法二百三十條第一項提起公訴。（二）被告黃寳琦係靜安寺分隊長，李　係新閘區區隊長，當大火延燒時，率靜安寺區三十號救火車至火塲灌救，其時二十九號王家洋房尚未延及，黃寳琦與李壎別有用意，不予灌救，於尚未着火時向王家僕人借日光燈。上下樓梯覓取王家貴重物件，的半小時後王家三樓又起火，致全弄洋房八幢均被燒燬，區隊附朱慶，周悅實及警士劉繼漢，趙榮江，黃克勤，王振山，楊阿寳，仝尊武，王松淸，湯長生，劉連壁，楊應善，羅靑，顧根福等乘機侵入二十九號竊取財物，區隊附王鐘秀，警士王鳳安，李阿山等則入二十七號竊取財物，以上犯罪事實皆由各被害人與證人等證明，允以李壎係負責指揮人員，黃實琦係負責灌救二十九號者，而均故意不予灌救聽任燃燒，此項消極行爲與積極放火無與，應負放火之罪責。被告朱慶瀾，王鍾秀等十七人有出入二十九號或二十七號之行爲，而該兩處亦均有財物被竊，該被告等旣出入其間，核有刑法第二十八條，第三二一條第一項第五款之罪嫌，被告李　有刑法第十五條，第一七三條第一項，黃寳琦有刑法第十五條，第一七三條第一項，第三十八條，第三二一條第一項第五款之罪嫌，並依同法第五十五條處斷。因各被告均係公務員假借職務上機會而犯罪，應依刑法第一三四條上段加重處刑，合依刑事訴訟法二百三十條第一項提起公訴。</p>

<p>英海軍陣容，昨據倍爾福斯兵艦海軍上尉愛司格蘭姆稱：「今日對東華之友誼聯歡賽，英海軍方面，極爲重視，故曾於上週中，與猶太隊作練習賽時，愼重挑選精銳，惟日前與蘇聯隊練習賽時，發覺混合隊之聯絡方面，尙嫌鬆懈，故今日決定由倍爾福斯隊單獨應戰，俾取得熟習之聯絡合作。」該隊門將諾維區較爲軟弱，然全隊作風硬派，長力充沛，中軍　斯，實爲靈魂，東華諸將，宜小心應付。</p>
<p>東華隊戰綫，因李垚於日前離滬，調排頗爲困難，直至昨晚六時半，始由買幼良公佈，蓋李垚可能於今日趕返參戰，全部原陣不動外，宿將戴麟經梁樹棠及李寗，屆時亦決定重作馮婦，故東華今日軍容將更見完善。</p>

<h3>汕隊五戰五勝昨晚撃敗春茂</h3>
<p>友誼賽　仁餘一分勝哥倫布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕二屆籃球聯賽，昨晚（一）甲汕組汕隊五戰五勝，又以四十四比二十六敗春茂，（二）甲二組甲申六十三比四十四勝鐵路滬。原有海陸靑對仁餘之戰，因海陸靑參加美海軍埠際籃球上海隊選拔賽，且賽後有兩球員受傷，臨時要求改期，經徵得仁餘同意，並獲籃委會許可，乃由主辦當軸另的哥倫布隊，與仁餘作友誼賽，成千觀衆，呌好不絕，結果仁餘在最後三秒鐘，由姚文彝中一球，以四十六比四十四勝。昨晚各塲戰情如次：</p>
<p>汕隊戰勝春茂春茂　賴罰球由何涵夫獲一分開紀錄，十分鐘時劉福善見勢不佳，抱病入替鄧國璋，汕隊以十三比五遙領，陳淸江活躍，蔡演雄紀南康亦一致進攻，上半時以廿一比十佔先，春茂上半時內七次罰球未中，影響不少。下半時春茂情勢略佳，三十比十四時，油隊何立德五决犯規畢業，由林維聰庖代。據謂林亦在病中，二人一身大汗，當能霍然。春茂傳球常難抵籃下，被對方攔截，汕隊陳淸江獲分獨多，結果四十四比二十六勝春茂。</p>
<p>甲申勝鐵路滬　甲申鐵路滬　汕隊春茂之後作戰，甲申夏澤人首先罰中，聲勢較盛，五分鐘內，戰成九比三。十分鐘時鐵路滬宋鈺張渠等迎中數球，打成十二分平千，甲申朱　　　以二分　　，鐵路緊隨不捨，廿二比十七時（十五分鐘）張林根已畢業，由本家其昌入替，上半時三十一比　十一甲申稱雄。休息再賽，成　　面，最後四分鐘，爲五十　比三十六，鐵路防綫空虛，結果六十三比四十四甲申勝。</p>
<p>仁餘勝哥倫布　哥倫布之出塲與仁餘作友誼賽，使昨晚觀衆不致因海陸靑之改期掃興而歸，哥倫布勃魯齊擲市後，仁餘沈鵬舉吳新運姚文彝以六比二超出，哥倫布勒士馬勃魯齊，戰成六分平手，勃及愛許猛襲比數更增至十一分，仁餘盡力應付，上半時方得以十八比十五反敗爲勝。仁餘下半時仍保持原狀，在最後二分鐘　四十二比三十九，　哥倫布　成四十四平手，姚文彝在最後三紗時中一球，即成四十六比四十四，一球定勝負。</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>昨夕籃球聯賽，申一組春茂負於汕隊，在意料中，但慘敗九球之多，蓋亦有因：　開賽時，福善，天烈均未上塲，春茂前鋒無射籃人材，反賴賢政與福强兩後衛獲分。</p>
<p>汕隊何立德與蔡演雄搭檔，蔡傳籃下空隙，何穿出接球，反身投入，何彈力奇佳，春茂無法遏阻。兼以陳淸江手風順遂，射中率達其本人最高標準。</p>
<p>汕隊與春茂原係宿敵，知對方弱點，十三比五時，福善裹創應戰，表演減色，且被蔡演雄全神緊守，無法施展，直至汕隊以三十八比十八佔優時，福善投中第一球。</p>
<p>下半時春茂鄭家彪支撑殘局，幾次邊角吊入，否則局面更不堪設想。</p>
<p>另幕仁餘·海陸靑之戰，臨時改爲仁餘對哥侖布友誼賽，在一路領前的形勢下，仁餘贏哥侖布一球。</p>
<p>是戰旨在切磋球藝，仁餘不復存心理上的緊張狀態，各人均保持平日水準，全隊打成一片，進攻有路：覓空擋，走位置，球到人到，純熟默契，短傳近遞，穩妥而又美觀淸晰，與戰華聯一役，恍若兩隊</p>
<p>哥侖布是守力堅强的隊伍，但下半時內，仁餘竟如入無人之境，昨賽仁餘投籃仍嫌輕率浪費。（昌年）</p>

<h3>證交增收買方一成特證　華股後市掀起賣風　永紗回瀉內衣統益等跌停</h3>
<p>華股昨初堅繼疲，午前形勢頗有秀色，曾有六種漲停。迨所方增收買方特證一成後，賣風始被掀動，永紗急切回瀉，有四種股票跌停。緣證交鑒於邇日股市漲勢不止，為防制價格過度波動，特於午間公吿，自即日後市交易起，徵收遞交交易買方特別證據金百分之十，以後如遇股價　跌，亦可使遞交賣方提供現品，或微以適度之特別證據金，以制裁之云</p>
<p>晨開見高，遞永紗上塲初時由多空掉期而見盤，四號一八〇號一九八號二一五號一〇二號俱售，九七號進現出遞，加上一三號二一七號一四一號亦賣，遞交降至三三入〇元。一九二號一五六雖一七七號八〇號一二九號趁低來進，中法新亞永公漲停，圓升至三四八〇元·一四號一八號九七號一二九號脫手，降至三四二〇元。八〇號一九八號二二四號二四七號再進，掙扎之餘，曾將遞永紗扳高至三五二〇元。三一號一三號九一號一〇二號一八五號見高來售降至三四三〇元。商務中絲漲停，此時尙有盤頭，九七號一九八號二一八號七六號九一號一五六號奮售，近午見怯，遞永紗降至三三五〇元。六一號二二三號郁進，午收回出三四〇〇元關。結果較前收計永紗華豐新華微降，新光景福勤興各跌半成，中法漲停，美亞漲一成弱，信和微升，遞交美亞曾吿漲停，而後微回，結果漲二成弱，永紗信和華豐新光各漲一成至成半，冷股中絲商務五和新亞漲停，永公曾迫漲限而後梢回，榮豐火柴國貨景綸各升半成迄一成，中紡內衣則跌一成光景，餘者榮辱互見，永紗掉期仍由中小型銀行及套利集團貼進，自一五〇元退至一三〇元。</p>
<p>午後所方突通告增收買方特證一成，引起賣風。一九九號二二四號一九二號一九八號一八五號紛售，遞永紗自三三〇〇元跌至三二四〇元，九七號六一號二一八號五七號四七號二二號均有維持，一〇六號二二〇號小進，回升至三三四〇元。中法新亞尙吿漲停而稍穩。二二六號二三五號三二號一九八號一五二號一六〇號一九七號仍買，遞永紗降低至三一九〇元。二一九號二三一號九七號二一五號梢進升至三二八〇元。內衣由八九號，水泥由一〇二號，統益由八四號，永榮由一九八號掛低至跌停。一九八號一五二號四號二二三號四七號九五號二二四號一四號二〇七號一再供給，遞永紗盤跌至三〇六〇元。六一號一七九號九七號趁低有補，臨收回升至三一〇〇元外結束。結果較前收計永紗信和新光勤興各跌一成左右，美亞華豐跌半成，景福跌成半弱，中法漲停後有回，結果升一成。遞交永紗微升，新光平平，信和尙升半成，美亞升一成，冷股新亞永公漲後有回，尙升一成，統益永業內衣水泥曾跌停，商務國貨五和升，中紡跌各一成，其餘升降俱微，塲外股升者居多。</p>
<h3>紗市傳將恢復限價　紗廠客商昨開始入塲買賣</h3>
<p>當局為實行經濟緊急措施方案，對棉紗準備恢復限價　，據關係方面透露、經濟部將核准紡管會議定標準限價，將來市塲買賣及紗廠拋售，均不得超過該項價格，至此項新限價，可能較現在收購價略高。此項辦法，當局已在計議中。一俟正式實行後如廠商違反議價，決予以嚴厲制裁。　又訊。淞滬警備司令部理濟偵查網棉紗組，自與紗商業同業公會決定取締場外交易，會由該公會辦理紗廠及客帮紗商登記，發給入塲證，自昨日起，新會員已開始參加市塲買賣，總計參加市塲者，已達八百八十三單位，其中紗廠二八四單位，客商三十餘單位，其餘均為紗號。</p>
<h3>紗市反動回漲</h3>
<p>昨日紗市反動回漲晨初承上日之疲勢，開盤價較上日績跌五六萬元，旋以津帮採辦，紅魁星及天女兩牌布廠，添配三十二支及四十支單紗，頹風頓止，情勢為之一振，價遂冉冉上升。輕磅雙馬始做三百十二萬，竟較上日紡建掛牌之三百二十萬反眨低八萬，旋以游資乘廉吸收，最後以三百三十萬收盤。其餘各支紗無不普遍回好十餘萬，四十支單紗尤為缺悄，價竟駕凌四十二支雙股綫之上。聞暗盤在七百萬左右，尙乏供售焉。</p>
<h3>紡建與飛花業雙方成立協議</h3>
<p>社會局經濟行政處，爲飛花業同業公會社綏案，昨召集紡建公司與該飛花業同業公會談話。計到有紡建公司吳叔方·程俊卿·飛花業公會到有訂鴻生·李古精·胡桂笙等。由周科長味辛主持，經協議要點如下：（一）紡建公司飛花作國內或國外買賣，在同樣</p>
<h3>外滙影響煤斤成本　礦商希望調整價格　——配售虧蝕決由政府貼補——</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據燃管會某負人談稱：近來本市煤斤來源，仍以開　爲主。東北方而亦有少量運到，膠濟路及中興等煤礦，供應尙無把握。台灣方面目前暫時無煤運到。刻下各煤礦生產成本，百分之卅至四十，須要外匯。而最近外匯牢　整，已漲百分之二百六十，故各礦高對產煤價格，望能調整增加百分之一百四十至一百六十。當局以經濟緊急措施實行伊始，礙難調整價格。然估計各礦商生產成本，至少亦須增加百分之百，始能勉維生產。現政府已決定對配售予各公用及交通事業之用煤，其配價照舊。惟各礦商蝕之數，由經濟部貼補百分之八十。至配售各工商事業用煤，其配售價尙待經濟部核定。此次政府採取貼補政策後，專實上各礦商當仍感不數成本。惟政府深望各礦商對採用器材等，應力求撙節，即維持原有煤源，暫時勿再加深開發。</p>
<p>又目前招商局代燃管會運煤，自秦皇島運滬，每噸取價仍爲二萬七千五百元，虧蝕甚鉅。又鐵道代運煤斤者，運費亦不够本。現運費決仍維持不變，惟虧蝕之數，由交通部中補百分之七十。至外商船隻運煤費，每噸仍爲美金六元三角五分，並不調整。條件下時，上湘市飛花業同業公會會員有優先權。（二）凡售於飛花業間　公會之飛花，必須　售會員，不得由公會自行經營。（三）儿作再生產用（即製棉花十支紗五支紗）之斬刀，抄　絲，及頭號破子買賈，與第一條協議同肅辦理云。</p>
<h3>細布略見回升</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，各檔細布客帮逢低吸收，價見微升，嗣為紡建公司供售白坯布，藍鷄細布配價十四萬零五百元，較為鬆動，浮戶　逢高拋售，碼充斥，致價一度軋低。終以客胃不弱，結果十二磅龍頭細布價為十五萬四千元，比上日回升四千五百元。五福　布十五萬一千元，亦升四千元，其餘各牌俱昂二三四千元不一。色布元布及士林布實銷甚淸。價挫自三四千元迄萬元，其餘各貨則漲跌互見。；</p>
<h3>糖價趨勢略堅</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢略緊，公會　盤，現貨二四粗白　二十一萬三千元，廿二號中砂白十九萬三千元至二干元。三半車白現貨十九萬五千元至七千元。九期棧單十八萬六千五百元至七八九千元，下午十九萬一千元。台赤十三萬六千五百元，秘書細砂初爲十八萬三四五千元，後爲六千元至六千五百元，號貨開出汕提青十三萬元至十二萬九千五百元，順德青十二萬七八九千元，計二百包弱。慶元薄片青數十箱，十萬〇五千元。刁青五十包，貨較次，十二萬五千元，興化白十八萬八千元至五千元，興赤十三萬二三千元次十二萬四千元</p>
<h3>外股回跌</h3>
<p>外股昨晨穩後疲，怡紗晨開二〇二〇〇元，曾見二〇七〇〇元高價德後平盤、係受華股方面之間接影響，廣帮及洋行帮有所了結，而以低價結束，各橡皮股已見平穩。給果較前收計鋼業回跌一成弱，餘均下挫少許迄半成弱不等。</p>
<h3>統債交易甚旺</h3>
<p>公債昨依然熱烈，成交數逮一千，餘萬元。統丙晨開一二〇〇〇元外帮仍來吸納，升至一三二〇〇元。業中多方，逢高有售，退至一一七〇〇元。午收仍在一二一〇〇元掙扎。結果較前收計申乙丁戊各升一百元迄三之百元不等，絲丙漲五百元。</p>
<h3>橡膠業希望　放寬進口結匯　並提高關稅以資保護</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查本市橡膠業工廠共七十三家，規有混合車三四二部，每月共需橡膠量一七三九·五噸·天津工廠四十家，現有混合車八十部，每月共需二七〇噸。又有政府接收者八家，月需二一〇噸。重慶九家，現有混合車二十八部，（普利在外），月需六八噸。靑島及台灣八家，月需四七〇噸，未明者約一二〇噸。瀋陽月需二〇〇噸，廣州月需四五〇噸。故上海以外各地，合共一七八八噸。全國生橡膠需要量，每月為三五二七·五噸，該業過去情形，尙見繁榮。現以原料之採購，發生問題，危機潛伏。按我國生橡膠之供應，本受英美法荷四國之統制出口。今年度起取消統制。但自舶來品限制入口以後，執貨者以奇貨可居，在一個月內，每磅價格田一千元增至萬元，尙不易採購。現因生橡膠一部份可以結匯，故價格回落至五六千元。為維特國產橡膠製品起見，橡膠之入口結匯，似應放寬。至橡膠業每月需大量之沉澱炭酸鈣，國產炭酸鈣工廠有五家能生產，惟目前產品供不應求。如增加投資，加以發展，可能達到自給自足之目的。又查目前美貨汽車胎，多用人造橡皮，其效用祇及天然橡皮百分之四十。故國產橡皮製品，反勝舶來品。現聞英貨存印自由車胎五六萬副，即將貶價來滬傾銷。故該業希望當局能堤高關稅，藉以保護云。</p>
<h3>柴炭到旺步跌</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤屑因喊價過高，去胃呆滯、交易淸稀。烟煤塊因供貨較少，市况尙稱堅俏。白煤塊焦作，到貨驟增，市價徐見回降。柴炭亦因到源旺盛，進戶觀望，行市繼續下游。</p>
<h3>米市無變化　豆油續跌萬元</h3>
<p>昨日南北市共到米糧一萬二千石左右，市形早疲午堅，結果均與前日相仿。粳秈元米均少軒輊，惟河積尙豐，恐雖向榮。</p>
<p>麵粉內地趨堅，轉挺千元，麩皮不脫疲境，再挫千元。油市節節下降，生油步削六七千元。豆油淸油蔴油均一律續跌萬元。豆餅消化仍淡，市氣少神，續小千元有零。</p>
<p>。黃豆來貨尙覺踵接，東北大豆挺墾，漢口乍豆及杜豆疲頒之勢。茶豆下游之狀，紅糧再低千元，小麥平定，豇豆彷彿。生仁到消兩平，市萬平席，芝蔴穩定之象。赤豆見疲千元，蠶豆平淡之格。</p>
<h3>柴油棉花運滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕怡和公司外洋部經理之力斐特勝利號，前日到滬，由舊金山裝來貨品二千餘噸，以柴汕二千餘桶為大宗，其次有棉花六百件，其餘均屬雜貨。又招商局林森號，昨日駛粵，裝去生仁六千一百餘包，豆子一千餘包，豆餅三千九百塊，疋頭一百九十餘件，棉紗七十件。</p>
<h3>賣方脫貨求現　祁紅交易展開</h3>
<p>英商需求不戰之祁門紅茶，連日因吐納雙方態度倔强，久乏正式成交。昨市晨開後，即在一般調劑資金之貨主相率吐出中，買戶趁機撳壓，結果交易雖吿展開，市氣則頻露軟化，行情猛挫不已。他若各式外銷綠茶，除陳久多年之次貨，目前片　難以脫手外，餘如三十四年及三十五年度之花色，求者仍未斂跡，惜吃價亦緊，致成議欠暢，猶少升降。紅緣茶內銷，依然處於狹溢龐圍內，人心終平。</p>

<h3>診金和醫師身分</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>社會就是這樣的一個社會：能够增加本身的聲價的，便能提高自身的身分。置身於現社會的人們，無一不是如此。就是通這以「救人濟世」，「福利人羣」為任務的醫師，也同樣不能例外。醫師所訂診金的高低，便往往看作他們身分的高低。社會上一般的人士，對於醫師地位身分的高低，技術的良吾，本領的優劣，一大半，便拿這診金高低來做標準；醫師自己呢，亦幾乎目此毫無疑義的定則。</p>
<p>不要說兩位出身相同，技術相等的醫師，因診金的彼此不同，往往會被人視的身分地位有不同，技術本領有高低；即有某一位技術精良，本領高超的良醫，　會因為所訂診金的低廉，而易為一般的人們，認為身分技術都不及診金昂貴而本領低劣的庸醫呢！我舞不是時常聽得一般人們的說話嗎：「某某醫師真是有身價有聲譽的大醫師啊，他們的手術診金非要幾百萬幾千萬不辦」　，「某某醫師的治病本領，一定高明，一定超羣的，他們的門診掛號要三萬五萬，十萬八萬，出診要幾十萬呢」！「某某醫師的掛號金，只收幾百幾千，一定不會多大高明」，「某某醫師手術診費不到幾萬，還抵不上大亨醫師們的號金呢，說不定是江湖一類的人物吧」？……所以這個所取診金的多少，所訂診例的高低，便無形中成為一般的人們對於醫師身分，醫師技術的高低的唯一準則了。</p>
<p>因為一般的人們，把診金的高低，即認爲醫師身分的高下和本領的高低之故，於是一般「識時務」的聰明醫師，也便把握住了這一個民衆心理來行事。用了種種方法抬高診金來增高自己的身分和地位不然的話，便會降低自身的身價，表示不出自己高貴的醫師身分，而且會被病家目為「價廉無好貨」，而加以鄙視的！這診金的一高一低，在一大部份的醫師的自我觀念中，也便無形中成為本身的聲譽，地位，和身分的或高或低的定則的樣子。</p>
<p>其實呢，這種觀念，是很不正確的，這種心理，是很不妥當的，這種見地，是完完謬誤，大大要不得的見地。事實上醫師的身分，是不宜拿過分昂貴的診金去抬高的；技術的優劣，更斷不能拿所訂診金的高低來做標準。診金昂貴的，固然也有本領高明的醫師，但誰敢說，就中沒有江湖派頭的庸醫？診金低廉的，雖然不能無技術平凡的醫師，然亦未始沒有高明而忠實的良醫呢。</p>
<p>所以拿所訂診金的高低，視作醫師身分的高低和技術優劣的標準，是很不合理的，是不符眞正的事實的。</p>
<p>我們來推究一下：如果一般的病家，抱定了「診金的高低便是醫師身分的高低」這一種不正確的心理觀念，去處理疾病時的醫藥問題，醫師呢，也利用了病人這種不合理的羣衆心理，去從事他們的診療工作，對於社會，對於民衆，會發生出點什麼影響來呢？我以爲很顯然地，非發生一種極不良的現象，極不利於大一衆的事實出來。</p>
<p>這是如何明顯的事實！提高了診金，便無形中減少社會一般經濟能力不甚充裕的病家的就醫機會。誰都曉得，社會斷斷不應是少數財富者的社會的，而　屬於全體民衆的社會；「服務社會」，這豈不是我們為醫者的惟一信條嗎？「福利人羣」，這也不是我們為醫者的惟一任務嗎？可是，這所服務的「社會」，照理，總不能限於少數財富者的社會，應該同時也是大多數的平民大衆的社會；這所救濟的人世，所福利的人羣，也總不應只限於少數有產者的人世羣，應該同時也是大多數勞苦大衆的人世羣呢。提高了診金，减少診治病家的數量，恰巧違反了服務社曾的宗旨，違反了救人濟世，福利人羣的目的任務。醫師的診金，訂得過分高了，不但大多數的下層民衆害病時，絕無上門求診的能力，起是一般經濟能力不是十分充裕的中等階級的病家，也要感到醫藥太昂貴，生病容易，延醫診治難呢！</p>
<p>假使做醫生的，果能以明瞭官身「服務社會」的眞正意義，不以提高診金，减少一般勞苦貧病的診療機會的辦法，來抬高自身的身分；却能迎合大衆的胃口，適應一般中下層階級的病家的需要，在可能的範團中，减低對於病人的診金，以擴大診療工作的服務範圍，那才是現社會下的人民大衆所歡迎的醫師；惟有為人民大衆所歡迎的醫師，才算得上眞正盡了「服務社會」的任務，才稱得上眞正有身分有德性的醫師。至於一般病家呢，如果也能改變其對於醫師診金高低，即視爲醫師身分高低的謬誤心理；而以工作的技術，服務的精神，對於病家的態度，以及本人的德性，作為醫師身分高低品德高低的標凖，才算是合理的見解，才是正確的觀念。用了這種合理的一見解，正確的觀念，來作為患病時擇醫求診的標準，那才不會上江湖醫生的當，而能獲得診療的美滿效果哩。</p>
<h3>葡萄糖鈣與丙種維生素合併注射之檢討</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓述　宋恩灝記</p>
<p>在肺癆病特效藥發明以前，三十年來關於化學療法，不知幾經更變；目下一般醫師應用之化學療法，要算葡萄糖鈣與丙種維生素合併注射最為流行而普遍，上自通都大邑，下至窮鄕僻壞，凡屬醫師，咸知應用，未聞有非議之者，賓不敏，竊有疑焉，請言其其故。</p>
<p>（一）肺癆病在進行期中，患者體內之礦質及石灰質，均大量消耗，前者呌做脫礦現象（Demineralisaton）後者呌做脫鈣現象（Decalcifeication）發熱，消痰，蝺齒，燐尿，都是這些現象的表現。所以病者有補鈣（Recalcification）及補礦（Remineralisation）的需要，因此葡萄糖鈣之注射，遂列人化學療法之一。</p>
<p>（二）酸性物質，有溶解鈣質之可能，因為這個綠故，肺癆病者的食譜當中，所以嚴禁酸性食物的服用。譬如酒，醇，啤酒，醋，咖啡，檸樣，橘子，蘋菓，番茄，菠菜等，因含有各種酸，如醋酸，草酸，檸檬酸，蘋果酸，所以均在禁止之列。這些酸性食物服用之後，能使體中鈣質增加其消耗，藥物之屬於酸性者，自不適用於肺病病人。</p>
<p>（三）根據止列兩現象，可知對於肺癆病人，鈣劑是適用的，酸性藥是不適用的。丙種維生素不是別的東西，他的學名呌抗壞血病酸（Ascorbic　Acid）與葡萄糖鈣合併注射，顯然是一種矛盾的作用，注射後，使鈣質失其作用，雖無顯著的損傷，却也沒有絲毫的裨益，</p>
<p>（四）還有一層，就是鈣劑注射，並非適用於一般的肺癆患者。譬如纖維型及石鈣型的肺癆病者，體中之鈣質已達飽和程度，鈣劑濟射未必有益，又如老年患者，其血管已經硬化，若再注射鈣劑，將使硬貨愈益加甚。所以葡萄糖鈣的注射，僅適用於進行性肺癆病者。而內種維生素合併注射，尤為不合理之處置。</p>
<h3>讀「脾臟的問題」之後</h3>
<p>— 姚星叔</p>
<p>筆者雖不是多情人物，但讀了前輩余雲岫先生的「脾藏的問題」（文見本刊第一期）之後，却不能毫無所感；拉雜書陳，卑之無甚高論，聊當補白。</p>
<p>一，日本醫人，把我們古今慣用來代表消化系分泌腺的「脾」，稱做「膵臟」，想來想云，老是想不出是何道理。我們評多現代的醫書，是從日文翻譯來的，或是參考日文書寫作的，所以「膵臟」長，「膵臟」短，用得着實不少。這個「膵」字，看樣子好像是個中國字，其實是日本製造，日本人有他們的讀音，我們因爲是月字旁邊拼一個萃字，便讀萃。「膵臟」這個名詞，原來就有問題，中國人不老是顢預，我們敎育部審定的名詞，便改為「胰腺」。「胰」這個名稱，大概算是從俗，這件柔軟帶紅黃色的東西，猪玀身上也有，普通人呌做「胰子」，從前沒有雪花膏，蛤殼油，娘兒們預防手皮皺裂，冬季來臨，便拿牠塗擦皮　。照余先生說法，我們如不數典忘祖，「胰腺」這個名稱，亦有問題，值得討論，這且放下不談；無論如何，「胖臟」二字，現在總不應該再用了，但我無意之中，翻到國定本高小自然課本第二册五一頁，還用着這兩個字，而中學的生理衛生書，却用的是「胰腺」。據聞國定敎科書內容可議之處甚多，這自然是小之又小的了。</p>
<p>二，日本人把我們已名「脾」的東西，呌做「膵」，而以「脾」名我們不知名的東西，我們現在還因製着，這便是余先生的「脾臟的問題」，日本人可謂善於攪七捻三，指鹿為馬了。日太人真是「馬鹿」，我們打開日文醫書一看，「營養」的「營」字，他們都作「榮」字，「營養」是生理學的術語，「榮養」另的他解，所謂揚各顯親，奉養，是孝順的兒子對老子的說法。日本人對於中國文字，一直是膳攪，比如我們謙稱「敝處」「敝店」，日人都作「弊處」「弊店」，任憑他是公正廉潔，也非「弊處」「弊店」不可，中國人如其模　學樣，便成了不小的笑話，可不是嗎？股近讀到陳方之先生著急慢性傳染病學，大用其「榮養」二字，頗生異感。陳先生大著，極有價値，願介紹讀者一讀；筆者在妄的吹毛求疵，似乎有點和陳先生瞎觀了。</p>
<p>三，日本人還有一個和我們攪不淸的名詞，日本醫師的私人診所，每每稱為某某醫院，恬不為怪；我們所謂的醫院，他們却呌做病院。上海一開間門面的醫院，識者齒冷，但日本人看起來，到視爲理所當然。現在自然沒有人說學學日本了——其實由國人怕永遠學不上他們——如其有人担敢診所冒稱醫院，就得小心衛生官兒來找你的麻煩。</p>
<p>總而言之，雖是些小事，別人已經論錯，我們何可再誤？</p>
<h3>用「斯脫來多滿新」治療結核的檢討（四）</h3>
<p>— 楊士達</p>
<p>（四）結核性膿胸</p>
<p>應曉氏曾用「斯脫來多滿新」治療七個結核性長期膿胸症，其中四位祗用胸腔注入法，沒有得到効果。其他三位是同時用胸腔洗滌及肌肉注射的，只有一位無疑的得到効果。一九四二年這位病人曾要求施行胸腔切開手術，切除了肋骨三根及其附着的肋間肌肉；目的為排洩膿液及被混合傳染的氣管胸膜瘻，在這種狀態之下，可以用噴霧器把「斯脫來多滿新」噴射在胸膜上面，同時再施用大量肌肉注射。氣管胸膜瘻很迅速地收口，經過三個月的治療後，膿液裏的結核菌也消滅，先前道個人曾經過四年的觀察，輾轉施用，各種的治療都沒有効果。</p>
<p>這是很感覺到驚奇的：「斯脫來多滿新」的殺菌作用，在結核性膿胸症方面，不能儘量發揮。大概是因為膿胸液平常多是酸性的，可是「斯脫來多滿新」要在中性或鹻性的，容易發揮牠的力量。同時要注意給核症是一種肉芽腫蕃殖，不是一種單純的結核菌</p>
<p>（五）結核性瘘管</p>
<p>應曉氏曾施用「斯脫來多滿新」治療十五位患表皮瘻管的病人，膿液裏都曾找着結核菌，其中有一位患着多處的病竃，如頷骨窩淋巴腺瘻管，鼠蹊部淋巴腺瘻管及胸廓瘻管等。病變局定在頸項及腋窩淋巴腺約有六位，在胸廓的二位，在腹壁的一位，及在陰囊的二位。有二位患肋骨結核，一位患結核性頭皮潰痬，那個潰痬產生在　骨切開，腦結核瘤撞除手術以後。患腦結核瘤的病人祗受六固月的「斯稅多滿新」治療，神經方面得到漸時性的効果大概是手術的成績。並且那個病人六個月以後，在別處死亡了。</p>
<p>十五位病人在注射四至六個星期後，每個人都得到效果：膿液消滅，創口收復，是効騐的證明，不過在這個時期治療就停止，短期內的復發是常見的，所以表面上的成功得到後，須要繼續幾個星期的治療，以後所得到的効果，比較可以長期維持。十五位病人中有十位的　管已收復四至十二個月，有三位保持反復狀態，有二位是新近得到痊愈，治療仍舊繼續進行着。爲希望得到長期及完全的痊愈起見，每日施行用二公分的「斯脫來多滿新」繼續注射三至四個月，是認爲適當的治療量。</p>
<p>「斯脫來多漢斯」的確能够使幾種頑固的瘻管收復，如胸廓結核及結核性淋巴腺炎（歷　）等症。爲避免復發起見，創口收復後，治療仍舊尖當繼續着幾個星期。</p>
<p>（六）生殖泌尿器的結核</p>
<p>據應曉氏的經騐，「斯脫來多滿新」對於結核性膀胱炎，能阻止症勢的進行，保持着固定的狀態，在大多數的情形中，只有姑息療法的價値。對於腎臟結核沒有治療的効果。若選擇比較早期的結核性膀胱炎，膀胱壁還沒有高度纎維性變，治療後的微狀効果也要更顯著。</p>
<p>在這些特別選擇的病例中，尿的結核菌，雖經動物接種，已經證實消滅，但仍舊有重新發現的傾向。若經過長時間的治療後，結核菌重新發見在尿中，可以認定那些結核菌有在試管中，也有抗藥效的力量。應曉氏治療的十五個病便中，約百分之五十的徵候，往往長期減輕，二位最先治療的，已經過十八年的治療，繼續着感到徵候的减輕，但是小便裏有時仍舊發見少數的結核菌。十五位病人中，有二位患結核性副睾丸炎，引起陰囊　管，膿液內也找到結核菌，經過幾個星期的治療後，瘻管收復，治療停止後，各個保持着痊愈狀態，已六個月及十個月。</p>
<p>總括來說：用「斯脫來多滿新」治療結核性膀胱炎，可以得到暫時性的效果，對於腎結核眞正的効果很少見到，所以「斯脫來多滿新」療法，對於單側腎結核，還不能代替外科手術。</p>
<p>（七）骨及關節的結核</p>
<p>廠曉氏會治療骨及關節結核五例，一般的講：外表的効果，是顯著的。</p>
<p>（八）成人外科性肺結核</p>
<p>「斯股來多滿新」曾七决和外科手術同時施川在患肺結核的人，手術前復皆注射相當分量，至於手術後的注射，他的主要的目的是防止結核性合併症的發生，一般的講，「斯脫來多滿新」可以帮助病體復原。（下期續完）</p>

<h3>廣陵花社——揚州續夢之十二</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>廣陵花社開設的地點，在目下揚州的舊城八巷附近，開設的期問，在民國元年至四年。名為花社，實係茶社，可是比之現在的一般茶社，却顯然有雅俗之不同。朝南的三問大聽房，題為琴棋書畫室。從這題名去推想，對於那裏茶客的成份，以及茶客們的動態，當不難了然。廳房前搭着敞棚，也是賣茶的處所。四週花木扶疏，看去亦小有園林之勝。　首有一排廻廊。迴廊盡處，便是一問朝南的「曲房」。主人嚴某，原不在牟利，而在於有管絃絲竹之勝。因此每到夕照銜山以後，華燈初上，曲房裏個　鼓喧　，歌聲嘹喨。此時一般茶客多已陸續離去，所留下的不是雅好高歌一曲的人們，便是些顧曲周郞了。</p>
<p>在此花社中，常為人所稱道約有三人：一是唱崑曲的謝春江，一一是吹笛子的王朗，三是彈古琴的廣霞。廣霞是華大工廟的和尙，王朗是贊化宮的道士，至於謝春江，則是捐過候補鹽火使，總算「讀聖賢書」的人，眞是儒釋道合為一家了。</p>
<p>道士本多善奏絲竹，而王朗則以笛子著名。廣霞雖是和尙，却不茹素，因此養得腸肥腦滿。可是彈得一手好古琴，在揚州就更無人能及他。他那泠泠的琴聲，如是你閉目凝聽，眞會令人消遣世慮，彷彿置身於另一個高潔的宇宙裏，再也不會想到眼前彈琴的却是一個酒肉頭陀。說到謝春江，據聞過去家境也還小康，却因雅好崑曲，不事生產，積日旣久，也便漸漸拮据起來。可是他還樂此不疲。一位和他相熟的人吿訴筆者說：記得有這麼一天，微雨霏霏，他正穿過碧蘿春巷，向校塲走去，忽然聽到巷子裏有一家正在敎着雛妓學唱曲子，便停下不走了。他斜倚人家門前，一面傾耳注聽，一面還用脚尖點着拍子。經過不少的時光以後，適巧有一舊友走過，見他痴痴停在那裏，很是驚異，近前拍拍他肩頭呌着「春翁」，這才使他覺察到自己停留已久，衣衫盡濕。他朋友調侃着說：「春翁！你這行徑，倒和紅樓夢裏賈寳玉差不多！」彼此不禁撫掌大笑。原來謝春江是個「曲迷」。</p>
<p>這花社開設的壽命，祗短短的不足四年，便已閉歇。以上所說在花社中常為人稱道的三位，便也風流雲散，先後藏身於黄土壠中。無論「絲不如竹，竹不如肉」，而這三位在絲竹肉方面所表現的，總是再也不能聽到。即使仍有繼起之人，更有何人能好事如嚴某又開設廣陵花社呢！</p>
<h3>山水</h3>
<p>— 朱其石</p>
<p>牛先生的——「日課」</p>
<p>— 黑平父</p>
<p>也難怪，牛先生自從和牛太太結褵以來，他從沒有把她過過一天好的日子，甚而至於在這「度日如歲」的三年中，光陰消逝了足足有一千幾百幾十天，差不多很少有四五天能接連着的把小鍋小灶冒起烟來的，這就是說！牛先生的本領，很難得使他家裏不接連的四五天斷炊，况且搞得不好，一天兩頓都有些「朝不保夕」，所以牛先生的一家老小，到今天都一個個的鳴形　面</p>
<p>最初，牛太太是充分諒解牛光生的，那個時候還是在天下大亂，敵偽囂張之秋，牛先生秉了一副書獃子的骨氣，他寗可飢寒交迫，也不打算請某些高据「顯貴」的同學或親友「栽培，栽培」的，一方面呢！牛太太也總算不錯，她雖然四周都有極度引誘性的精神壓力，使她時時刻刻都自感到比誰也不如，可是她也總覺得「與其當漢奸，不如餓死了（，所以牛先生夫婦倆在那時倒確實的一致含辛茹苦，絕無怨言的企待着光明，他們倆想：「國家勝利了，一切總都有辦法的，眼面前吃些苦，年紀輕輕‘眞算不了什麼」</p>
<p>却不料，整整的一年冬來，牛先生的一家，還是日愁三餐，朝不保夕，於是，牛太太這才把牛先生看「扁」了，所以她常常冷言冷語的跟牛先生說：「當初漢奸之世，你出不了頭，倒是為的國家，然而鬼子垮台到今天已是哪麼久，你又何嘗把自己稍微搞得好些？偽幣是漢奸發行的，所以不會到你的乎上來，可是法幣也照樣的三五天不見你的面，雖不成國家已經不承認你是他的國民了　？同胞有四萬萬五千萬人，　　　　子的，誰手裏都</p>
<p>牛先生臉上燒，心裏酸，對於太太的訕言譏語，默默地回答不出一句話，朝她偷偷的翻一個白眼，想想看確實是自己有些對不住自已。可是這一類的冷言冷語，在牛太太只不過是每天「日課」的開頭，逢得無柴無米，這種「日課」總得做到和牛先生動起武來，有的時候還往往不能下塲。</p>
<p>雖然牛先生常常自忖：「早知道自已會弄到這步田地，當初就算她要打死我，也不跟她撮合的，巧婦無米難為炊，我以前總以為她是個王寳釧，十八年寒窰是不成問題的，誰想到頭尾只不過三年，她就把我看得一輩子翻不了身」，然而每當牛先生一想到這裏，牛太太就好像是他肚子裏蛔蟲一樣的把他所想的完全給猜中了，於是，便從冷言冷語的緩進狀態一轉而驟變了一發不可收拾的暴風急雨，牛先生到這個時候，也就怒不可遏的爽性把滿肚子的怨艾說了出來，因此一塲「勢不兩立」的對駡於焉：「演出得如火似茶」。</p>
<p>牛太太第一句約有利引證，便是：「我當初嫁給你的時候，你家裏並沒有堆滿了金子元寳，老實說，人窮無所謂，你要駡我勢利，如果我勢利，當初就不跟你結婚了，你不自己想想看，天下之大，窮的人也有，像你這種東來沒有飯吃，西來也還是沒有飯吃的倒霉人，你自己說像你這樣的天下有幾個？」這類「鐵一般的事實」，簡直是把個牛先生氣得眼睛裏直冒紅火，他越是滿面羞慚，她却越是把這幾句話翻來覆去的曉曉不休，直到牛先生實在聽不下去，拔起脚來化房外恨恨然一走，可是剛會說話的大孩子趕在他屁股後頭又哭又嚷的呌起來了。牛先生眞覺得進退兩難，他想：「老是吵，總不是辦怯，還是打怎麽開伙倉的主意罷」！孩子在一旁說：「爸爸，我肚肚餓肚子餓了，我要吃飯飯。」</p>
<p>第二天，牛先生又在和昨天一棵的開始了「日課」，隔壁人家的收音機裏，却正在收聽那齣他所最感到精神壓迫的「紅鬃烈為」了。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血197</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我想我們為什麽站着？鶴見正在那裏做着戲，我們為什麼不坐下來細細的欣賞？便也招呼耀羣和虎臣，揀了就近的一張桌子坐下。跑堂的一見，立即過來。我和耀羣，心下有事，只各人要了一份冰咖啡，虎臣一人，却要了兩份水角凌，兩份冰酪，四份點心，預備大嚼一頓。</p>
<p>可惜他的口福不佳，伺候我們的這個跑堂的，記下了我們所要的東西，剛一溜烟似的，飛步走開，虎臣也正擦拳磨掌，準備享受的當口，忽地聽得遠遠傳來一陣槍聲——砰……砰砰砰……砰——</p>
<p>這個槍聲的問歇式；「一三一」，正　W君部下開始行動的信號槍聲。這槍聲一響，門內門外，立即形成片刻沉寂。形成這片刻沉寂的理由，在我們這一邊，明明都知道是派出的突擊隊，奉命回來，發出信號，通知我們，我們當然靜了下來，監視着邊敵人的動作。而敵人那邊，忽然聽到槍聲，大的一時沒有找到頭緒，不免　而訝之，頓時緊張起來。如此一來，所以才製成了這片刻的沉寂。</p>
<p>可是這種沉寂，一霎眼即成過去。只見門外，首先騷動起來，一陣雜沓跑動的足步之後，火門口躍進了一個敵方的探報，搶進廳內，冲着那位張眉瞪眼，驚愕未已的「金司令」，一舉手：</p>
<p>「報吿——敵人三方面包圍進　，人數很多，完了！」</p>
<p>報吿已畢，翻身便跑。無奈這火廳內的地板，一律是上等柳木斜方塊拼合，堅硬無比，刨得極光，並且還敷着一層厚蠟，滑潤得很；那個探報傢伙，轉身太快，脚下又是一雙拖喪的釘靴，一個不留神，留脚不住，馬上赤溜卟　，餓狗撲屎一般，爬在地下。</p>
<p>這傢伙還不曾站起來，一陣哄笑之下，騫然聽見一個淸脆甜潤無比的女子嗓音，從我們身後，高聲喊着：</p>
<p>「鶴見大哥……」準準確確的東京語音。</p>
<p>我一回頭，只見　後電梯上下所在，一位丰姿綽約的女子，飛步翩躚，向鶴見這邊走來。一面疾走，一面似　似笑地說：</p>
<p>「趕來遲了……我是應該負責，給您一一位介紹的！」二位當然是指着鶴見和那位「金司令」了。</p>
<p>她的姿態，確也雍容大方。與那個「金司令」相較，當然一雅一俗，不可以道里計。但與我們的耀羣相形之下，只覺得一個是剛健婀娜，一個則嬌弱柔媚。</p>
<p>「哈，萍子小姐……！」鶴見正式的一鞠躬。</p>
<p>「大哥好您。」萍子雖是穿的北平旗衫，却是行的日本禮：「我跟您二位介紹介紹，」她又對那位「金司令」灣了　腰；「這一位是參謀部的鶴見玉君，近衛老爺新收的學生！」又對鶴見一彎腰；「這一位是井上米子小姐，新任華北衛戍司令部，川島司令手下的第二科行動隊長。」萍子把近衛和川島芳子兩個名字，替雙方的身份，强調起來。</p>
<p>在這種緊急慌忙的塲面下，忽然　入了這們文靜的一段交際插曲，而這種一鬧一靜，極不調和的焦點，刦集中在這位冒牌「金司令」的米子身上。看情形似乎有此尷尬，有此轉不過臉，有些不好下台。我倒要瞧瞧這傢伙，拿甚應　段來應付這種尷尬的局面，於是非常留神　　着。</p>

<h3>常班清死了</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>常班清已經明正典刑，在上海監獄的刑塲中槍決了，對於這樣一個作惡多端而且醜史悠久的漢奸之死，我們唯一的感想祗是：他到現在才處死，已經耗費了太多的囚糧！</p>
<p>常玉淸是什麼「黄道會」的「會長」。我們所要特別提出的，是這種「黄道會」之流的烏烟瘴氣的思想，有沒有澈底根除。</p>
<p>人家在熱烈辯論原子能問題，而我們呢？一年以前有過所謂「一貫道」鉅案，最近在上海還出過什麼狐他火燒，什麽「狐火二不過三」之類的「新聞」！至今辣斐德路上還有一家小小的像廟宇一般的店面，朱額金字，大書「王大仙」三字。至於扶乩之風，更是萬分「昌隆」，據說那些「乩壇」還要有組織地聯合起來，「統一散布仙界新聞」之餘，還要統一舉辦什麼「春賑」，「春季祈禱」之類－換句話說，是互通聲氣，加緊歛財！</p>
<p>盲從的市民們祇是「無知」。在教育成爲奢侈品的時候，「無知」固可原諒，但「無知」也正是我們這個老大民族最危險的敵人之一，因爲，正有人在利用這種「無知」心理，別具企圖。這種企圖，在世亂年荒，社會不安定的時候，就形成了「黃道會」，「一貫道」！</p>
<p>上海在淪陷時期，扶乩求神之類的風氣特別盛，其主要原因就在於敵人故意縱容：一方面是惟恐中國人民之不「愚」，一方面也許就在想培植常玉淸之流的勢力。</p>
<p>國必須跟上時代走，烏烟瘴氣的病態必須掃除！內政部已下令禁止服「仙方」之類的陋習了，上海應該比內地更走前一步，我們要求來一次「淸潔運動」，把這種「大仙」和「乩壇」等等一脚踢出去！</p>
<h3>地獄篇</h3>
<p>— 長空</p>
<p>也許我自己不應該有的壞脾氣，一聽說這個人曾經下過水，附過逆，不管他（她）只是担任過芝蔴那麼大的小事，但我總討厭他們到了極頂。</p>
<p>或許他有他的苦衷吧？</p>
<p>但是我總認為，只要他吃過敵人的「俸祿」，他總是可恥的。</p>
<p>但是事情往往出乎常理之外，許多人在抗戰前一期曾經受過敵人的「恩澤」，但抗戰後期却到後方來「洗」了一個「澡」，於是勝利了，到了上海，居然也是「重慶人」，他連屁股上的屎都沒有揩掉，臊也不臊？</p>
<p>因為生性討厭這些「非驢非馬」的人物，因之很怕與他們交接，但是這裏有一個比喩：說一個人恐怕人妨害他的「自由」，於是天天把自己關在房門裏，但是「不自由」的手，却會在「門外」來推敲你的「門」，這扇「門」，能守得住外來的侵擾麽這近乎夢想。</p>
<p>根據這個理由，每次我遇到那些陰陽人」，我希望少和他們接近，但是他們挨到你身邊，拍拍你的肩膀，拉拉你底手，他們要和你親熱地親近親近，你說：你不把手伸過去？你說你能當面拒絕和這樣的人握手麽？</p>
<p>根據這個理由，不怪「大義滅親」等等的措施，在現在，是「絕無僅有」的了。</p>

<p>自然，留聲電話，無論對私人，對商家，對任由機關，都是極有效的通訊利器，但不知它何時才能運來中國。</p>

<p>老祝臉上的笑容收去了，覺得有些為難。對於獻金勞軍運動，他並沒有存過分的奢望，他已經知道這一二年來後方的民氣是如何的消沉；但他是個熱情的人，有一種天眞的樂觀，總想勉盡人事，為這一個風雨飄搖的國家出最大的力。徐紹明不但和他是同學，並且還有不敢得罪他的原囚，但在倉皇逃難，搶運物資為第一的信念下，今天竟也對他堅强起來了，</p>
<p>眞到不得已的時候，他對老徐是可以使用一種要挟手段的，但他並不願意這樣做。而獻金勞軍這一件事，每當他獨自沉思的時候，也未嘗覺得太有聊。國內的一切平時糟到那樣，士兵的待遇平時苦到那樣，現在好像一個病人到了危急的時候，再想打强心針救命，是不是眞會有效，連平時最樂觀的他自己也不敢說。他這一次的所以要熱烈發起並完成這個運動，無非想用它來鼓舞一下民心，激勵一下氣。究竟能够　到多少錢是次要的事。僅僅他不憤於徐紹叫的一毛不拔，所以才來糾纏他。而徐紹明却祗允捐款五萬元！</p>

<h3>The Central Executive Committee Establishes a Research Committee to Discuss Ji Shuru's Former Foreign Policy, And a Proposed Plan Will Be Submitted to the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Central Executive Committee decided in its morning meeting on the 13th to establish a Foreign Policy Research Committee. Twenty-three members were nominated to specialize in studying current Chinese foreign policy issues. Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, and Zou Lu were designated as the conveners. The committee held its first meeting this afternoon at 4 PM in the conference hall of the Central Party Headquarters. The list of committee members is as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Zou Lu, Shao Lizi, Liu Wendao, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Peng Xuepei, Ma Chaojun, Chen Cheng, Zhu Jiahua, Yuan Shouqian, Gu Zhenggang, Fu Tongzi, Zhang Daofan, Liu Hengjing, Wang Shijie, Gan Naiguang, Wang Zhengting, Liu Jianqun, Jiang Jingguo.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Foreign Policy Research Committee of the Central Executive Committee held its first meeting at 4 PM this afternoon. Members such as Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, and Wu Tiecheng attended, and the meeting adjourned around 6 PM. The meeting engaged in a thorough discussion of current Chinese foreign policy and formulated a substantial plan. It is reported that the plan will be submitted to the President for review and simultaneously presented for discussion at the Third Plenary Session. The majority of the content is in response to the Soviet interference in Chinese affairs at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Central Executive Committee held its sixty-first meeting at 9 AM on the 13th. After detailed discussions on the five proposals drafted by the Proposals Committee for the Third Plenary Session, namely the current stage of party affairs reform, economic reform plan, tax system reorganization and revenue enhancement plan, preparations for constitutional implementation, and political reform plan, they were approved as proposed motions from the Central Standing Committee to the Third Plenary Session. Thirty-two members attended the meeting, chaired by Li Wenfan, which adjourned at 12 PM.</p>
<p>Reform of Economic Plan Will be a Major Proposal</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] One of the most important proposals for the upcoming Third Plenary Session will be the "Economic Reform Plan." This plan has undergone numerous discussions and is exceedingly detailed. Once approved, it will become the highest guiding principle for China's future economic measures. The plan, tens of thousands of words long, begins with a comprehensive review of past economic measures, pointing out the root causes of problems. It then formulates fundamental policies for the current situation, with detailed provisions for the budget (including expenditures and tax revenues), credit (including interest rates, etc.), specialization of financial institutions, and guidance for industry and commerce. According to a certain economic authority, if this plan can be implemented, phenomena such as inflation can be easily eliminated, and balancing the national budget will not be difficult.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Registration of Central Committee members and attendees for the Third Plenary Session took place on the 13th, the second day. A total of 94 committee members and 11 attendees registered, including 53 Executive Committee members, 16 Alternate Executive Committee members, 16 Supervisory Committee members, and 9 Alternate Supervisory Committee members. Together with the 58 committee members who registered yesterday, the total is 152.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan traveled to Nanjing last night to attend the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 13th] Hu Weifan, Director of the Zhejiang Central Committee Youth League Branch, Zhang Qiang, Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Fang Qingru, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, all traveled to Nanjing on the 13th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sources from Yunnan stated that of the nine Central Committee members from Yunnan, only Zi Zhi, Zhang Banghan, and Li Peitian, who were in the province, planned to travel to Nanjing today. The remaining Central Committee members are scattered in various places, including Li Zonghuang and Yang Jie.

Central Committee member Chen Xueping also flew to Nanjing on the morning of the 13th.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahua Issues a Stern Statement Condemning the Soviet Foreign Minister's Suggestion, The Youth Party Also Issues a Solemn Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the United Nations Chinese Association, issued a statement today regarding the Soviet Foreign Minister's suggestion to discuss the Chinese issue at the Moscow Conference. He stated that China joined the World War earliest and contributed greatly. Before Japan's impending surrender in the autumn of 1945, the Soviet Union was still acting as a mediator for Japan, requesting conditional surrender from the Allied nations. Today, it has taken such an insulting action against China, its most loyal ally, violating laws and infringing on rights. Nothing is more outrageous than this! It is already a violation of the Potsdam Agreement that China was not invited to participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference, and discussing the China issue is even more a violation of the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Regarding Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal to include the "China Issue" on the agenda of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Chinese Youth Party issued a solemn statement yesterday, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"China is a nation that, after eight years of arduous struggle, finally brought about the downfall of Japanese fascism. Its position in the Far East is to protect its allies, without any hesitation, and to fight to the death against both Eastern and Western fascist nations, ultimately achieving success. The qualifications it has obtained as an independent nation and its inclusion as one of the world's five major powers are not to be infringed upon or harmed by any nation. We wish to point out that China's current situation has an extremely unpleasant international background. We do not expect any international forces to resolve our disputes for us. We only hope that the international community does not exacerbate China's current situation. In other words, excluding international factors, the Chinese people can resolve China's own affairs themselves, without the need for excessive concern from friendly nations. Therefore, we believe that the Chinese nation cannot be bound by any discussions among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union outside the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, regardless of whether their nature is well-intentioned or ill-intentioned, and whether their form is open or secret, and as an independent country."</p>
<h3>Public Outrage Against Interference in Internal Affairs [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] In opposition to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's difficult proposal to interfere in China's internal affairs, there is widespread outrage in the capital from all sectors of society. Chairman Jiang and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have received telegrams from the Guangzhou, Baoding, and Hefei City Councils, student bodies, and mass organizations, firmly supporting the government, safeguarding sovereignty, and students in the capital and elsewhere are preparing to hold patriotic demonstrations to protect their rights.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Municipal Farmers' Association, Women's Association, Municipal Education Association, and other organizations, representing the four million citizens of Shanghai, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th, requesting that it be forwarded to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow, making a solemn statement firmly opposing the discussion of the Chinese issue, whether inside or outside the meeting, and urging them to recognize that the will of the Chinese people is not to be trifled with. In addition, they telegraphed compatriots across the country to respond in unison, rising up to safeguard the nation's dignity and sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Informal Discussion of the Chinese Issue Strongmen Issues, The Soviet Union Agrees to Invite Our Representatives</h3>
<p>Molotov Notifies the US and British Foreign Ministers, Some Legislators Suggest the Government Participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 13th] Molotov notified Marshall and Bevin today that he agreed to discuss the Chinese issue informally outside the conference and also agreed to have Chinese representatives attend. According to Marshall's suggestion, this negotiation should be completely unrelated to the Foreign Ministers Conference, and no communiqué should be issued after the negotiation ends. The content of the talks is limited to reviewing the implementation of the 1945 Moscow Agreement among the three countries. According to US sources, Molotov's notification did not mention the date for discussing the Chinese issue or whether a communiqué would be issued after the discussion ended. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union still won a victory on the Chinese issue. Although the Chinese issue was not included in the agenda, since the three powers are discussing it, the Soviet Union can question the United States about its Far East policy, which is the Soviet Union's goal.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that some legislators will submit a proposal, based on the resolution of the Potsdam Conference of that year, suggesting that the government request to join the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] There is great satisfaction here today that Marshall has rejected Molotov's suggestion to include the Chinese issue on the official agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference. A Washington evening newspaper ran the headline "Great Powers Prevent the Soviet Union from Discussing the Chinese Issue." According to US broadcasts received here from Moscow today, Marshall contacted Washington after Molotov suggested discussing the Chinese issue yesterday. It is also known that Ambassador Gu Weijun held talks with US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Oppose Interference in China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Howard-owned newspaper, the World-Telegram, published an editorial today titled "Interfering in China," opposing the informal discussion of the Chinese issue by the three countries in Moscow. The newspaper stated that interference in China by the three countries would lead to another world war.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The New York Times praised the three powers for rejecting Molotov's suggestion not to discuss the Chinese issue in a meeting without China's participation. The article stated that acceding to the Soviet Foreign Minister's request would be an unreasonable insult to a country that is one of the five major powers and a permanent member of the Security Council. There have already been too many things done without China's participation, and it is unacceptable to discuss the Chinese issue without China's participation again. According to reports, Stalin forced Roosevelt and Churchill to secretly recognize the gains in Northeast China at Yalta in Soviet territory, as the final price for the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan.</p>
<h3>Marshall's Statement Not Published in Soviet Newspapers</h3>
<p>Yan'an Radio Accuses the United States</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 12th] Today, none of the local newspapers published Marshall's statement on the Chinese issue made at the Moscow Conference yesterday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Yan'an Radio quoted an editorial from the Liberation Daily on the 13th, saying, "The current Moscow Conference is bound to achieve success. No matter what means the reactionary elements use, they will inevitably fail." Yan'an Radio compared the United States' policy toward China to Hitler's policy toward Spain.</p>
<h3>Sun Lanfeng Returns to Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] Sun Lanfeng, Commander-in-Chief of the Cavalry of the Twelfth War Zone, returned to Zhangjiakou by car yesterday to report to the Commanding Officer on the combat situation of the Twelfth War Zone troops in Hebei. It is reported that after this elite force entered Hebei, it successively captured strongholds such as Mancheng and Rongcheng, and defeated the main force of the Communist army in the battle of Wucun Town, thus changing the situation of the war in western Hebei.</p>
<h3>Advancing Along Both Sides of the Jinpu Railway, The Nationalist Army's Left Wing Enters Feicheng, The Central and Right Routes Approach Da'wenkou and Sishui</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 13th] The Nationalist troops advancing north along both sides of the Jinpu Railway are advancing in multiple directions. Among them, the Nationalist troops advancing north from the front of the Jinpu Line have reportedly advanced to the vicinity of Da'wenkou. The Nationalist troops advancing east of the Jinpu Railway have advanced from Qufu to the vicinity of Sishui, repairing the Qufu-Sishui highway and continuing to advance. The Nationalist troops advancing north from Ningyang and Wenshang west of the railway line entered Feicheng at 10:20 AM on the 12th, completing a large encirclement of the Communist troops gathered in the Mount Tai mountain range. Feicheng is only 50 kilometers away from Dangjiazhuang south of Jinan. After eliminating the Communist troops in the Mount Tai area, the Nationalist troops can open the remaining 50-kilometer section of the Xuzhou-Jinan railway line at any time.</p>

<h3>The Central Committee Accepts Our Proposal, UNRA Purchases Cotton to Ship to China, The Relief Plan for China Continues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] UNRRA Director Rooks announced today that the Central Committee has accepted China's proposal to use the funds not yet designated for use in the relief plan for China to purchase cotton, and has authorized the Chinese government to use the proceeds from the cotton to assist in the distribution of other relief supplies from UNRRA. The acceptance by UNRRA was based on the recommendation of the UNRRA Far East Committee after consultation with the Chinese government and the UNRRA branch office. The purchase of cotton will depend on the funds available, which also stipulates that, if necessary, the Far East Committee may, with the consent of the UNRRA branch office, approve the work of free distribution, starting from March 15th and extending for six weeks. Rooks continued: UNRRA may provide China with an additional supply of cotton worth approximately US$5 million. The US supply of cotton to China has been set at 13,810 metric tons, worth US$53,626,000, of which 81,651 metric tons have been shipped, worth US$39,700,000, 8,222 tons are currently being shipped, and 13,917 tons will be shipped in April and May. UNRRA officials told reporters that Brazil and India also have plans to ship cotton to China, but official figures have not yet been released. Rooks said: According to the State Department's order, all UNRRA supplies shipped to China must be delivered to retailers by May 31st. In addition to the additional US$5 million of cotton, it may be possible to purchase cotton worth US$10 million for shipment to China. The relief plan for China has been severely hampered due to its late start and the paralysis of the distribution system since China's eight-year war. Rooks said: Due to China's financial situation, the Chinese government must raise huge sums from its own resources, rather than from the proceeds of selling food, medicine, and other relief supplies, to support distribution work. The Chinese government had previously indicated to UNRRA its agreement to distribute cotton cloth and cotton yarn worth 45% of the total value of the cotton to the poor free of charge. The Chinese government has requested that these regulations be eased in order to raise funds needed to distribute other relief supplies. UNRRA's general relief work plan has been 85% completed. The relief plan for China, which started later, is only 66% completed and will continue.</p>
<p>Increased Supplies Shipped to Communist Areas</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 12th] In response to questions, Rooks said: UNRRA in China is "still trying to provide relief to the Communists and has achieved some success." He said that the amount of supplies shipped to the Communist-controlled areas of China in January of this year was more than in any previous period, including 500 tons of medical supplies and clothing. These supplies were not dropped from airplanes, although other medical supplies were airlifted in this way for a short time.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Martial Law Time Shortened, Most Taipei Shops Have Resumed Business</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] Most shops in Taipei City have resumed business today. There are also more pedestrians on the streets.

<h3>Representatives of Taiwanese Groups in Beijing and Shanghai Report on Their Trip to Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Representatives of six Taiwanese groups in Beijing and Shanghai, including Yang Zhaoxi and Chen Bisheng, a total of thirteen people, previously, due to the February 28th Incident in Taiwan, voluntarily requested the government to provide transportation to Taiwan to assist the government in comforting the Taiwanese people and resolving the incident. They flew to Taiwan on a special plane on the 11th, but due to discrepancies between the plan and reality, they were hastily urged to return to Beijing on the 12th. Without contacting government authorities during their one-day stay in Beijing, they invited reporters at 4 p.m. on the 13th to report on the actual situation in Taiwan and the course of their trip. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Motivation for going to Taiwan: Before departure, they met with Bai Chongxi twice to discuss Taiwanese affairs, requesting several points: (A) Abolish the special administrative governor system and change to a provincial government system. (B) Abolish the monopoly system and the provincial trade. (C) Dismiss Chen Yi and punish corrupt officials. (D) Do not send troops to Taiwan to deal with the Taiwanese people with force. Bai replied at the time that sending troops to Taiwan was a matter of national defense and that he would never use force against the Taiwanese people. The special administrative governor system in politics would be abolished, and the monopoly system could also be abolished. Regarding Chen Yi's leadership in Taiwan, since such a major event occurred, Chen could no longer stay in Taiwan. Therefore, these conditions were accepted by the government, so they decided to go to Taiwan.</p>
<p>(2) Itinerary: On the 11th, a special plane flew to Taiwan via Shanghai in the afternoon, arriving at 5:15 p.m. By the time they rested at the hotel, it was 5:30 p.m., and they immediately contacted and met with Taiwanese people. However, starting at 7:30 p.m. that evening, they were surrounded by military police dispatched by the Administrative Governor's Office, losing their freedom to contact the outside world. Subsequently, through the results of the liaison between Division Commander He, who was sent by the Ministry of National Defense, and the Governor's Office, Chen Yi stated that he could not protect the safety of the delegation. They discussed that night and decided to return to Beijing as soon as possible on the 12th for further discussion. They arrived in Beijing at around 3 p.m. on the 12th.</p>
<p>(3) Actual situation in Taiwan: After the February 28th Incident, until today this month, Taipei was under the control of the people, and mainlanders could not go out. After the 8th, the opposite was true, and the authorities took repressive measures. Outside of Taipei, the government transported troops by plane. In terms of the entire Taiwan, the government can control seven cities, so if the government uses force to solve the incident, it is impossible to achieve it in the short term.</p>
<p>(4) Inside story of the incident: In a nutshell, this incident was a resistance by the people to the suppression of politics. The disappointment in life for more than a year and the extreme hatred for officials have now erupted in total. In addition, there is another major driving force, that is, more than 50,000 young men who had just returned to Taiwan from Hainan Island and were forcibly conscripted by the Japanese participated in the action. These more than 50,000 people are distributed in various parts of north, central and south Taiwan. This time, it was a cooperation between the people and the young men.</p>
<p>(5) Chen Yi's style: Chen recently drafted a three-year policy plan and decided to extend the implementation period of Taiwan's constitutional government to the 38th year of the Republic of China, because if constitutional government were implemented and the governor were elected by the people, Chen would not be able to be elected. In military affairs, Chen has been the garrison commander. In the past, the government sent the 70th Army to Taiwan, but it was not under Chen's command. Therefore, he used disguised methods to expand the army, expand the police brigade, and establish an organization of three brigades, with one brigade having 1,800 people. At the same time, he strengthened the anti-smuggling police, such as the Monopoly Bureau police and the Trade Bureau police, and established a special service regiment. Chen wanted to use this as his private force and become a disguised army. However, after the February 28th Incident, the police brigade could not fight, so almost all of the people's requests were accepted, and even the functions of the Governor's Office could hardly be carried out, and members sent by the Governor's Office and the people's organizations were responsible for handling it. Until the arrival of the National Army, Chen's attitude immediately changed, all promises were overturned, and the handling committee was dissolved.</p>
<p>(6) Hope that the government urgently hopes that the government can agree to our requests and fulfill its promises. If the chairman's announcement can be realized immediately, the Taiwan issue can be ended immediately.</p>
<p>(7) Future trends hope to meet with the chairman to report on this matter, and hope that the chairman can fulfill his promises. Finally, Yang and others, following reporters' questions, said: Chen Yi must be transferred back first, and then Bai sent, then the overall situation can be determined.</p>
<p>[Another Telegraph] Taiwanese representative Chen Bisheng stated at a press conference on the 13th: The report stated that Taiwanese compatriots in Hong Kong advocated for a telegram to the United Nations Conference requesting that Taiwan Province be a United Nations-mandated territory. I believe that the Taiwanese people have no such intention. If Taiwan Province wants to seek progress and reform, it must be a part of the Republic of China and must not leave the Republic of China.</p>

<p>As the British and Soviet foreign ministers argued heatedly at the Moscow conference, President Truman was delivering a startling speech to the U.S. Congress, frankly warning the American people and peace-loving nations worldwide that "world peace and American security are threatened by the rise of Soviet totalitarianism." This not only dealt a severe blow to the high hopes we held for the Moscow foreign ministers' conference, but also made us hesitant to be overly optimistic about the prospects for the post-war international political situation.</p>
<p>I recall the harmonious atmosphere at the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting in New York last December! In particular, there seemed to be a great possibility of reconciliation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and it was eventually decided to draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria at the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow today. At that time, international observers were celebrating world peace, believing that the turbulent post-war world political situation had finally found a peaceful resolution, and they harbored great hopes for the international politics of 1947, especially for the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting being held in Moscow today, predicting that genuine peace would be achieved this year. Unexpectedly, after the opening of the Moscow conference, Molotov first raised the China issue, causing an international uproar; then, at the second meeting, he arbitrarily attacked the administration in the British-occupied zone of Germany, prompting British Foreign Secretary Bevin to retort, resulting in a verbal battle at the third meeting. This gave the world a very negative impression of the Soviet Union, with everyone believing that, although the Soviet Union was chanting about world peace, its actual actions were not heading towards world peace; everyone believed that, although the Soviet Union had loudly proclaimed democracy, in practice, it still retained its totalitarian system. Therefore, President Truman's speech was not groundless but was born out of genuine concern.</p>
<p>After reviewing the full text of President Truman's speech released by the Associated Press, we can summarize the following key points: (1) World peace and American security are threatened by the rise of Soviet totalitarianism, so the United States should immediately send arms, money, and military advisors to Greece and Turkey to deal with communist provocations in those two countries. (2) The initial aim of American policy is to maintain the current government of Greece, making it the last bastion against communism in the Balkan Peninsula; otherwise, communism will spread to the Middle East, and the consequences will be unimaginable. (3) If the United States cannot promptly aid Greece and Turkey, the consequences will affect the West; even in the East, it will be affected, so we should immediately take decisive action. (4) The people of some countries have recently been subjected to the rule of totalitarian regimes, which have been imposed upon them by force against their will. A certain country does not hesitate to violate the Yalta Agreement, frequently resorting to coercion and intimidation against certain countries, especially Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland, and the U.S. government has lodged protests against this.</p>
<p>Although President Truman did not directly mention the Soviet Union in his speech, it was undeniably aimed at the Soviet Union. President Truman's issuance of such a strong diplomatic statement was unprecedented since he took office, and no matter how it is interpreted, it is ultimately not a friendly gesture from Moscow's perspective. Therefore, we must ask, why did President Truman dare to deliver this strong diplomatic speech? Is he not afraid of deteriorating U.S.-Soviet relations? Regarding the former, we believe the reason is simple: because President Truman believes that the American people share similar views with him, and they will definitely support his diplomatic policies, so he is fearless. As for the latter, for the sake of world peace and also for the sake of American security, President Truman sincerely hopes to work with the Soviet Union to jointly create world peace; at the same time, he believes that if the four major powers can still maintain the spirit of fighting side-by-side during the war, then the creation of peace will undoubtedly succeed; however, the current turbulent world political situation is ultimately due to the Soviet Union. After the war, the Soviet Union not only has ambitions in Europe, but also has its designs in the Far East; wherever Soviet power extends, there is its "Iron Curtain." Therefore, there are only two options for the U.S. and Britain to deal with the Soviet Union: one is to adopt a policy of appeasement, satisfying the Soviet Union's demands in every way in exchange for Soviet cooperation; the other is to adopt a tough policy, making it wary and preventing it from crossing the line. Considering the failure of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Germany before the war, it can be seen that President Truman is determined not to repeat the same mistake. According to public opinion in the United States, the majority of the American people do not support adopting a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union; moreover, they believe that a policy of appeasement only increases its desires and is harmful rather than beneficial. Conversely, adopting a tough policy, while it may worsen U.S.-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union's foreign policy emphasizes realism and views international relations as a balance of power, so it cannot but take the U.S. warning seriously and reconsider its attitude.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that although President Truman's speech is sufficient to become a factor in the deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations, the only way to make the Soviet Union change its diplomatic style is for the U.S. to adopt this kind of attitude. According to a Moscow dispatch from the Associated Press, after Molotov learned of President Truman's speech, his attitude at the foreign ministers' conference became more moderate; he also made many concessions to the British Foreign Secretary. If this dispatch is true, then it is sufficient to prove that President Truman's choice was very wise.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is truly unfortunate that the opening of the Moscow conference caused an international uproar. Mankind has longed for peace for a long time, and the expectations for this foreign ministers' conference are even more eager; however, once the conference opened, it caused an international uproar, how can it not grieve us? President Truman has issued a warning, and all peace-loving people should unite to defend world peace and no longer be threatened by any totalitarian regime; at the same time, the Soviet Union should also reconsider and deeply reflect, if it wants the world to maintain peace, it should have a spirit of tolerance in any international conference, focus on the big picture, seek international coordination, and thereby complete the great task of creating world peace. This foreign ministers' conference is truly too important for the safety of the world and the happiness of mankind; we have long said that this international conference can only succeed and cannot fail; and now the key to success or failure is entirely in the hands of the Soviet Union, so we sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will deeply reflect on President Truman's warning and change its attitude! This is not only fortunate for the world, but also fortunate for the Soviet Union!</p>

<h3>Limiting the Continued Expansion of Soviet Power - The U.S. Shifts to a Tougher Diplomacy - Marshall Will Meet Directly with Stalin</h3>
<p>[Report from our Office] San Francisco Broadcast, 13th: According to reliable American sources, Marshall has been ordered to adopt a tougher policy towards the Soviet Union at the foreign ministers' conference, and President Truman's address to Congress is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>[Associated Press] (Moscow, 13th) According to information here, Marshall will soon meet with Stalin to explain the new American policy. However, it has not yet been decided whether Marshall will take the initiative to request a meeting or wait for an invitation from the Kremlin. The Kremlin's banquets for foreign guests also provide an opportunity for talks, or at least for arranging a formal meeting. Everyone is exploring "what impact this may have on the foreign ministers' conference."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] President Truman and Foreign Secretary Bevin today issued speeches in Washington and Moscow accusing the Soviet Union of activities in Eastern Europe and Germany, which are the strongest expressions of the U.S. and Britain since the war. Regardless of whether their simultaneous release was a coincidence, their combined effect is to announce to the world that the U.S. and Britain "will not sit idly by." Truman's request to Congress indicates that the U.S. only allows the Soviet Union's sphere of influence to stop at the borders of Greece and Turkey. He further accused the Soviet Union of forcing totalitarian regimes on the Baltic countries within its sphere of influence. Bevin, at the Moscow conference, directly pointed out to Molotov that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled the Potsdam Agreement. What should be noted now is what impact the remarks of the two major leaders of the U.S. and Britain will have on the Moscow conference. London diplomatic observers believe that Truman's speech shows that the U.S. diplomatic policy has become increasingly tough since Marshall took office as Secretary of State, based on three new principles: (1) The U.S. recognizes itself as the world's leading power and will fulfill its responsibilities from now on, no longer relying on other countries such as Britain. (2) The initial method of the U.S. is economic and financial assistance. The President has broadly interpreted aid, so other forms of assistance can also be adopted. (3) The basic policy of the U.S. is to assist free people and oppose 武大 total governance or external pressure.</p>
<h3>Molotov Makes a Demand - International Control of the Ruhr Area - The Four Foreign Ministers Begin Reviewing the Allied Control Council Report</h3>
<p>[Report from our Office] London Broadcast, 13th: Molotov convened a preparatory meeting for the four foreign ministers' conference at the Aviation Club at 4 PM (Moscow time). Also, the four countries foreign ministers held meetings in three groups at 11 AM. The first group organized and simplified the Allied Control Council's report on the German problem, the second group organized the report on Austria, and the third group of experts studied the economic problems of the Austrian peace treaty, including the issue of compensation.</p>
<p>[Report from our Office] London Broadcast, 13th: Regarding the issue of speeding up the economic unification of Germany, the U.S. is determined to obtain the Soviet Union's approval. This determination has been secretly warned the Soviet Union at the foreign ministers' conference that if it does not agree, the industrial equipment used as compensation will be reduced.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th] The Moscow Broadcasting Station recently issued a message stating that the four foreign ministers held their third meeting today and immediately decided to review the important clauses of the report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany. According to this report, the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries has reviewed and approved it, and it is expected that the foreign ministers' conference will begin reviewing it at the fourth meeting, which will take several weeks. This resolution was proposed by Molotov, and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and French Foreign Minister Bidault both expressed their approval. Molotov also requested that the Ruhr area be placed under international control, and said that the German problem must not be confused with the German economic unification problem. In addition, it is learned that the Bulgarian government has sent a letter to the foreign ministers' conference, requesting that a Bulgarian delegation be allowed to attend the meeting and report Bulgaria's views on the German peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Bevin's Sharp Rhetoric</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union Agrees to Announce the Number of German Prisoners of War</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 12th] At today's four-nation foreign ministers' conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov first decided to take a defensive position, accepting the request of British Foreign Secretary Bevin to announce the number of German prisoners of war held by the Soviet Union, and admitted that the Soviet Union had not "completely destroyed" the German battleships, but denied that the Soviet Union held three million prisoners of war. He stated that the exact number would be revealed only after all the allied countries had announced it simultaneously. The other three foreign ministers agreed to this. British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech lasted 45 minutes, and Molotov did not answer all of the requests he made. Bevin also defended the detention of factory equipment in the occupied areas, arguing that Germany must first become economically unified, which is the same as what Marshall expressed yesterday. The various requests made by Bevin in his speech are listed as follows: (1) The allied countries should announce the exact number of German prisoners of war they hold; (2) Announce when they can be allowed to return to their homes; (3) The four countries had previously agreed to destroy the German battleships, but now the Soviet Union has not followed through, and should be asked to explain the reason; (4) The type of industrial equipment that the Soviet Union has removed in the occupied areas should be explained; (5) What is the current production ratio in the Soviet-occupied areas; (6) How much of the German industry in the Soviet-occupied areas has the Soviet Union taken over; (7) The plan for the normal economic standards of Germany after March 1946 set by the Allied countries has been abolished. After Bevin's speech, Marshall also continued to speak, expressing his agreement with all of this.</p>
<h3>Reactions in Moscow After Truman's Speech</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 13th] It is increasingly believed here that Marshall was aware of Truman's speech yesterday before leaving Washington.

TASS had not yet forwarded the full text of Truman's speech at 9 AM this morning (12 hours after Truman's speech).</p>
<h3>The Greek Problem</h3>
<p>Can Be Resolved Through Political Means</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 13th] Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris recently commented on the government's plan for a full-scale offensive against the guerrillas, saying: The Greek problem can be resolved through political means, just like the situation in Azerbaijan Province of Iran.

<h3>The U.S. Considers Economic Aid to Hungary</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] According to the New York dispatch of the Standard Evening News: The U.S. government is now studying a plan to provide financial and economic assistance to Hungary. The plan proposes to give Hungary a free loan of 40 million U.S. dollars and a commercial credit loan of 5 million U.S. dollars for the purchase of American cotton.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Trusteeship of the Former Japanese Mandated Islands - Five Countries Will Present Their Views - The Issue is Postponed Until Next Monday for Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 12th] The United Nations Security Council today unanimously decided to invite India, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Canada and the Philippines to participate in the discussion of the U.S. trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. At the same time, it was decided to postpone the issue until next Monday for further discussion, so that the governments of these countries can notify the Security Council whether they are prepared to attend and present their views. Australian representative Hasluck proposed an amendment stating that the current agreement should be submitted for approval in the Japanese peace treaty. British representative Jebb also proposed an amendment, advocating that preferential treatment for American commerce in the trust territory should be prohibited. At the meeting, Secretary-General Lie submitted for discussion a telegram from New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser on the 13th of this month, requesting permission to participate in the discussion of the former Japanese mandated islands. The Indian liaison officer also sent a letter to the Security Council, requesting that India be invited to participate in the discussion, and requesting that the discussion be postponed so that other non-member countries could also present their views. At this point, U.S. representative Austin said that he would also like to express his agreement to the fact that New Zealand, India and other members of the Far Eastern Commission would send representatives to the meeting to present their views, but the U.S. could not accept the reasons put forward in the New Zealand Prime Minister's letter.</p>
<h3>Japanese People's Desperate Delusion - Hoping to Obtain American Loans</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] According to information obtained by this agency, senior Japanese officials are already discussing that Japan may follow the path suggested by the U.S. for aid to Greece and Turkey, and request a kind of "anti-communist" loan from the U.S. The reporter said, "President Truman's speech indicates that the U.S. will act as the protector of democracy around the world, so if we can prove that if we do not get foreign aid, we will tend towards communism, then we seem to have a very good opportunity to obtain a revival loan." A senior Japanese financial official said that if Congress approves Truman's request, it will inevitably divide the world into two camps, one camp gathered under the U.S. and another camp gathered under the Soviet Union. He also said that Japan had long feared the Soviet Union's power in this part of the world and hoped for American aid. He also strongly stated that Japan would rather be under the American camp.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representatives Arrive in Norway to Continue Boundary Demarcation Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Oslo, 12th] Soviet representatives arrived here today, and their mission is to continue the boundary demarcation negotiations that began in Moscow last August.</p>
<h3>Turkey Needs American Aid to Guard Against the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Ankara, 12th] Qualified government officials declared today: If Turkey wants to maintain its army of one million men in full mobilization to guard against a possible Soviet invasion, it must obtain American aid. For seven years, Turkey has been in a state of full mobilization, with more than 60% of its national income used for military expenditures. Most of its troops are currently stationed along the Turkish-Soviet border east of the Black Sea and the Turkish-Bulgarian border. The huge expenditures have caused a drain on financial resources and have put the entire economic system in danger. The Turkish army is not well-equipped. If Turkey becomes a weak country, it will only invite all kinds of disputes. Therefore, providing aid now is less sacrificial and more far-sighted than trying to save it later.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Philippines Military Agreement to Be Formally Signed Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] The four treaties and agreements between the U.S. and the Philippines (including the U.S.-Philippines 99-year military alliance agreement for the U.S. to establish 23 land and sea military bases in the Philippines) are scheduled to be signed on the 15th by U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt and Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino on behalf of the two governments. The other three agreements are the consular treaty, military aid, and extradition measures. After several months of negotiations, the U.S. finally decided to reduce its military bases in Manila and reduce the total number of military bases in the Philippines from 70 to 23, of which 7 are emergency bases.</p>

<h3>British Government Survives Crisis, Conservative Party's Impeachment Motion Rejected</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 12th] A vote of no confidence in the government, proposed by Conservative Party leader Churchill, was rejected by the House of Commons today by a vote of 374 to 198. The House of Commons then approved the Labor government's economic recovery plan by a vote of 371 to 204. Earlier, Churchill accused the Labor government of "misleading the country and harming the people," and that Labor officials placed the interests of the party above the interests of the government. He also stated that before nationalizing British industries, the Labor Party itself should be nationalized first, placing the nation before the party, and declaring that Labor cabinet members were first and foremost British citizens, and only then considered themselves socialists. Churchill loudly proclaimed, "In less than two years, our country has fallen from a glorious position in the world. The lack of bread should not exist, nor should the coal shortage occur. If the government had foresight and carefully managed affairs, these situations could have been easily prevented. The British people are now all undernourished." Cabinet members responded by shouting "Nonsense!"</p>
<h3>U.S. Adopts New Diplomatic Approach, Key Points of Truman's Speech</h3>
<p>The President strongly urged Congress to approve the allocation of $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey and to assist their recovery in other ways, in order to support free nations and resist external coercion... (Full text on page 7 of tomorrow's newspaper)</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman addressed a joint session of Congress today, calling on the American people to use money, materials, and military force to stop the advance of world communism. Although the President did not directly name the Soviet Union, his meaning was very clear. He proposed a new diplomatic policy, specifically requesting Congress to allocate $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey. Truman also stated that, if necessary, he would not hesitate to request additional funds to assist free nations in maintaining national unity, to prevent aggressors from attempting to impose totalitarian regimes on them. We are now in a position of world leadership, and any hesitation could endanger world peace and undoubtedly endanger our own well-being. The President suggested four points: (1) Approve the allocation of $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey until June 30, 1948; (2) Authorize the government to send civil servants and military personnel to the two countries to assist in recovery and supervise the use of the funds; (3) Pass legislation authorizing the government to freely use the funds to utilize daily necessities and other supplies and equipment in the most effective manner; (4) Authorize the government to educate and train selected personnel from Greece and Turkey. The last point refers to military training in the United States, similar to the British military advisory group during the last World War. The President's speech was met with cheers from the members of Congress three times. Once when he urged that attention be paid to supervising the use of aid funds, twice when he attacked totalitarian regimes, and once when he said that the situation would become more serious if assistance was not provided. According to Republican Deputy Leader Senator Wileish, this speech was tantamount to a declaration of war against totalitarian forces, but there seemed to be no other way to go.</p>
<p>Washington's Reaction [Reuters, Washington, 12th] The release of Truman's speech comes at a time when diplomatic relations are unusually strained due to the recall of the Soviet ambassadors to Britain and the United States. Although the President did not directly name the Soviet Union, his stern warning that "the current political landscape of the world must not be forcibly changed by coercive political means" was clearly directed at the Soviet Union. The President used the strongest possible language to condemn the Soviet Union for violating the Yalta Agreement and forcing totalitarian regimes on the people of Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria against their will. Veteran observers pointed out that President Roosevelt used similar terms to attack Hitler before the outbreak of World War II. President Truman specifically pointed out that the phenomena of wartime Germany and Japan have reappeared today, and his intention is to classify the Soviet Union's diplomatic policies towards its neighbors in the same category as the policies of Germany and Japan. It is recalled that during the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939-1940, Roosevelt and Churchill used similar phrases to attack the Soviet Union's aggressive policies. The most important point of Truman's speech was the call for Congress to take immediate and decisive legislative action to curb the Soviet Union's aggression and expansionist policies in a specific part of the world. This request is unprecedented in American history. Members of Congress also stated that if Congress approves Truman's request to guarantee the freedom and integrity of Greece and Turkey, its nature will be equivalent to the guarantees given by Britain to Romania and Poland before the outbreak of the Second European War. Truman and Marshall had previously stated clearly in secret meetings with congressional leaders that once the United States accepts its foreign responsibilities, it will never abandon them. In addition to Greece and Turkey, the United States should provide the same guarantees to other countries that are being coerced by Soviet diplomatic policies to force their people to accept pro-Soviet totalitarian regimes.</p>
<p>Congressional Views [United Press, Washington, 12th] The reaction in Congress to President Truman's speech was a mix of praise and criticism. Senator Vandenberg, President of the Senate and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated: "At this time, we must support the President, although there are countless subtle issues to be decided by Congress in detail." Vandenberg also stated that Congress could make a decision by the end of this month, as the President requested. However, American diplomacy should adopt a comprehensive policy, avoid imperialism, sincerely fulfill the Charter of the United Nations, and be suitable for the entire world, so that the same results can be achieved everywhere.</p>
<p>Britain, Greece, and Turkey Welcome [United Press, London, 12th] Regarding President Truman's speech to Congress requesting aid to Greece and Turkey, people in Britain, Greece, and Turkey unanimously expressed their warm welcome tonight. However, a spokesman for the Greek left-wing liberation front expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the United States' move was to replace the "fascist regime" in interfering in Greece's internal affairs and would intensify the Greek civil war.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 12th] Well-informed sources told a United Press reporter today that the United States has implemented a new policy towards the Soviet Union, which happens to be in effect at the time Secretary of State Marshall is attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The United States' policy is not intended to disrupt the Moscow conference, but to show the Soviet Union that the United States is taking a new approach. If the Soviet Union is willing to follow this approach in consultations, then the person in charge is currently attending the conference, namely Marshall himself.</p>
<p>Gromyko Silent [Reuters, New York, 13th] United Nations officials do not hide the serious situation caused by President Truman's speech. Soviet representative to the Security Council Gromyko declined to comment, while United Nations officials believe that Truman's speech shows that the United States has recognized the extreme seriousness of the situation, which is already beyond the handling of the United Nations. Polish people feel that the difficult situation in Greece will become more complicated due to Truman's actions, which is most unfortunate. Democratic Senator McCarthy said, "If the United States interferes in Greece and Turkey, it means war," while Republican leader Senator Taft said, "Whether or not interference in Greece will lead to war with the Soviet Union depends on many other circumstances."</p>
<p>Truman in Florida [United Press, Key West, Florida, 12th] President Truman, feeling very tired after delivering an important speech in Congress today, has arrived at this naval base aboard the "Sacred Cow" aircraft for a short rest. The President, who is 62 years old, was instructed by his personal physician, Dr. Graham, to take four days of walks, swimming, and sunbathing to adjust his body and mind in preparation for dealing with the future situation. American foreign policy will face the most severe test in the future. When the President got off the plane, reporters asked if he had received any reports, and the President replied: "No reports at all. I don't know what the reaction is in Moscow or anywhere else."</p>

<h3>Government Officials and Merchants Collude in Corruption and Manipulation of Gold, Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren Arrested, Temporarily Granted Bail to Complete Handover, Departed for the Capital by Night Train Yesterday, Zhan Liansheng to Be Transferred to the District Court Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The authorities' determination to "fight tigers" in the gold rush case is now a reality. Zhan Liansheng, manager of Tong Feng Yu Gold Store and chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Lin Fengbao, former director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Yang Anren, former deputy director of the Business Bureau, took advantage of the Central Bank's distribution and sale of gold, colluding between government officials and merchants to manipulate and engage in corruption. After the supervisory committee filed an impeachment, Chairman Chiang was shocked and angered, and on the evening of the 12th, he telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to arrest them and hand them over to the court for handling. Zhan and the other three were arrested at 11 o'clock that night. Because Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren had not yet completed the handover of Central Bank business, Zhang Qun and Zhang Jia'ao, the new president of the Central Bank, met with the Chairman and asked for temporary bail, guaranteeing that they would surrender to the court after the handover was completed. With the Chairman's approval, the adjutant's office notified the garrison headquarters by long-distance telephone on the 13th, and Lin and the other two were temporarily released on bail. It is reported that they have already departed for the capital by train last night with Bei Yitong, the former president of the Central Bank. As for Zhan Liansheng, he will be transferred to the District Court this morning. The garrison headquarters has completed all the procedures yesterday.</p>
<h3>Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Headquarters Talks About the Inside Story of Collusion and Manipulation</h3>
<p>Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Headquarters told reporters yesterday the details of the case, saying: Regarding the facts of collusion and corruption by Lin and others, the following have been verified: First, the quantity of gold secretly sold by the Central Bank daily and the account books of the entrusted sales firms were not true. Taking January 27 of this year as an example, the Central Bank sold 1,820 gold bars to Tong Feng Yu, but Tong Feng Yu's accounts recorded 820 bars. The remaining number was listed on the second or third day, leaving loopholes for speculation and opportunities for manipulation. Second, the original application forms for the Central Bank's gold customers were later abolished, and Zhan Liansheng alone could decide who could purchase gold. Any other firm had to go through Zhan's hands to purchase gold. However, Tong Feng Yu, which was opened by Zhan Liansheng, had a total capital of only 15 million yuan, divided into 15 shares. Zhan obtained two shares, and one share was held on behalf of a friend. The identity of this person and the names of the shareholders of the remaining twelve shares were not revealed. A commercial firm with such a small amount of capital undertook the important task of regulating government finance. From January 23 to February 15 alone, it distributed more than 20,000 gold bars. The facts of collusion are very obvious. Third, on the day before the Central Bank stopped distributing gold, Tong Feng Yu purchased as many as 313 gold bars. Usually, when the price of gold rose, Zhan also used relatives or peripheral organizations to privately transfer gold. There is no doubt that government officials and merchants colluded and manipulated gold. Fourth, the Central Bank's secret sale of gold was also handled by Zhan Liansheng, but there was no record in the account books. Whether the price received by the Central Bank for the secret sale and the price at which Zhan Liansheng resold it were consistent is a major question. If there was no collusion from top to bottom, how could it be so frivolous? Fifth, the accounts of Tai Kang Run Gold Store show that Wang Li from the Central Bank purchased 114 gold bars several days before the price of gold soared. It is clear that Wang Li is a Central Bank employee. According to Xie Bingquan, manager of Tai Kang Run, the purchase from other firms may have been even more than this. The Business Bureau of the Central Bank should be held responsible for selling the gold it had distributed to itself under an assumed name for hoarding. The above-mentioned points are only those that have been verified and cannot be concealed. In addition, the case was sent to the court, and to maintain the confidentiality of the preliminary hearing, it could not be disclosed. In short, the state implemented the gold policy to stabilize prices, but instead, it took advantage of the opportunity and breathed the same air as unscrupulous merchants. It is truly heartbreaking to say. Now that the case has been transferred to the court for trial, there will definitely be a detailed public announcement in the future. Our headquarters has completed its handling of the Lin case.</p>

<h3>More Than a Dozen People on the Blacklist Will Be Arrested</h3>
<p>The blacklist of gold rush manipulators submitted by the Economic Supervision Group to Chairman Chiang was approved the night before, ordering the arrest and prosecution of those with serious involvement.

Lin Fengbao, former director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Yang Anren, deputy director, and Zhan Liansheng, manager of Tong Feng Yu Gold Store, were the first three to be arrested, so it is expected that the remaining "tigers" will be caught within a few days.</p>

<h3>Distribution of Goods in Kind to Begin, Many Agency Rosters Not Yet Submitted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The distribution of goods in kind to public school staff will begin this month, but to date, many agencies have not yet submitted their rosters to the city government. It is understood that the reason for this is that a copy of the organizational regulations must be attached when submitting the rosters, and extra personnel are excluded. However, there are no clear regulations on the organization of the various agencies stationed in Shanghai, so there are many difficulties. Currently, the Materials Supply Review Committee for Public School Staff in this city plans to send a letter to the Executive Yuan to inquire about the quotas for each agency, and will continue to meet on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss relevant matters.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of goods in kind to employees this month, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday that various factories and firms can prepare rosters and the quantity needed and submit them to the bureau for purchase starting today. If they do not intend to distribute goods in kind, they can still receive cash for the difference.</p>
<h3>Garbage Is Less Expensive Than Manure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] A contract will be put out for bid and is planned to be handled starting in April. Yesterday, Director Zhang told reporters that the estimated revenue from manure this year is 9.3 billion yuan. As for garbage, because it is not as useful as manure for fertilizer and it is difficult to make a profit, it is difficult to find anyone to contract the transportation. The city government once asked Senator Zhou Xiangsheng, a giant in the transportation industry, to be responsible for presiding over the matter, but he declined.</p>
<p>Senator Zhou Xiangsheng Declined with Thanks</p>
<h3>Passenger Planes of Two Companies Approved to Resume Flights the Day After Tomorrow, Registration and Ticket Sales Begin Today, Regular Trial Flights on the China-Siam Route</h3>

<h3>Preliminary Hearing of the Embezzlement Case at the CUSA Zhenru Factory, None of the Defendants Plead Guilty, Australian Deputy Director Chi Zhi Even Claimed He Could Not Answer Questions Without CUSA's Notification</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The embezzlement case at the CUSA Zhenru Machine Factory had its preliminary hearing in the District Court yesterday. The defendant, Australian Deputy Director Chi Zhi, evasively denied the crimes of colluding with the Polish Factory Affairs Director Xie Beiluo to steal and sell 55 boxes of plywood and 10 boxes of aluminum sheets. He claimed that he could not answer questions without CUSA's notification, but said that the stolen money he received was a gift from others. The other defendants, Xie Beiluo, Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Qian Zhengfu, and Cao Chiming, also tried to evade guilt, either shirking responsibility by claiming they were not in charge, or claiming they had not participated. Many of the confessions they made in the investigation court of the District Prosecutor's Office were not even admitted. The court will summon witnesses for confrontation and will reschedule the hearing for another day.</p>
<h3>"Government-Run Commercial Firms" Are Widely Criticized, Large Quantities of Luxury Goods Imported Worth Hundreds of Thousands of US Dollars, and It Is Rumored That They Were Ordered by Government Agency Personnel</h3>
<p>[United Press, Local Report] State-owned commercial firms have recently purchased imported goods worth hundreds of thousands of US dollars, and are not subject to the exchange restrictions and import regulations that private Chinese and American commercial firms have been subject to since last November. It is understood that Yitong Company, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Supply Bureau are currently importing large quantities of "luxury goods," such as high-priced cars, wireless radios, refrigerators, and other goods that the Chinese authorities have strictly prohibited from importing, while thousands of import permits and exchange requests from private commercial firms for urgently needed legal imports, such as heavy industrial equipment, are being ignored by the authorities. Shipping industry sources also confirmed that most of these luxury goods were ordered by government-related commercial firms for private customers, and it is rumored that they were ordered by government agency personnel to make profits for personal gain.</p>
<p>Chinese business people pointed out that Yitong Company is an agent of the Central Trust Bureau, ordering foreign goods at low prices and charging a commission of 2.5% when reselling them to private commercial firms and 1% when selling them to the government. As a result, Chinese and American commercial firms make very little profit and cannot cover their expenses, making it difficult for them to compete with "government-run" commercial firms. Chinese and American merchants are also highly critical of the fact that Song Zi'an's Fuzhong Company, Song Zi'an's China Construction Bank Company, and Kong Lingkan's Yangzi Construction Company can all use "special privileges" to engage in business. For example, one of Fuzhong Company's representatives is currently traveling on business in the United States using a Chinese diplomat's passport, while experienced Chinese business leaders who want to go to the United States are often not allowed to do so. Recently, American commercial firms in Washington and New York have protested to the State Department about the above-mentioned "privileged" commercial firms, accusing them of using political and other pressure to exclude foreign merchants from China. Although most American business leaders in China are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, most also acknowledge that the protests filed a month ago still exist, and believe that there is very little hope of improvement.</p>

Prosecutor Huang Daping stood up and stated that the defendant had admitted to all details of the assault, and that the defendant's claim of self-defense was not credible. The victim was severely injured at the time, so he was charged under the second paragraph of Article 277 of the Criminal Law. However, Cheng Rongfang's condition has gradually improved, and he is expected to recover, so the court is requested to change the charging article as necessary. The defendant's defense attorney requested that the court allow the victim to withdraw the charges, stating that the victim and his brother had both agreed to withdraw the charges, and that a recording of their conversation could prove this. Cheng Rongquan stated that he had no grudges against the defendant, but asked the court to handle the matter according to the law. However, the victim's lawyer pointed out that the victim's previous written withdrawal of the charges was a planned fraudulent act by the defendant's attorneys. After the arguments were concluded, the court announced the end of the trial, and set the verdict for the 15th.</p>

<h3>Two Health Bureau Employees Accused of Robbery</h3>
<p>Released on Bail and Immediately Suspended</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a newspaper reported that a Health Bureau staff member robbed a bidding merchant. According to Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei yesterday, the facts were quite different. A reporter named Liu Chunji had previously contracted with the Health Bureau to manufacture manure trucks and garbage trucks, and a contract had been signed. However, due to rising prices, he was unable to deliver the goods on time. According to the contract, a penalty was calculated for the delay in delivery, totaling more than 10 million yuan. Later, considering the merchant's difficulties, the bureau, together with the accounting and auditing departments, reduced the amount to more than 3 million yuan. On the 12th, Liu Chunji went to the City Bank to collect part of the payment. The Health Bureau, fearing that he would not pay the fine, sent two employees, Zhu Kai and Chen Bozi, to follow him. After Liu received the money, the two immediately collected the fine from him. As Liu walked out of the City Bank, he threw the remaining money in his hand on the ground and shouted "robbery," accusing Zhu and Chen of robbery. The police brought them to the police station. That evening, the Health Bureau telegraphed Director Zhang to request that the two be released on bail. Director Zhang, not wanting to believe one side of the story, did not approve the request. After inquiring about the details yesterday morning, Zhu and Chen were released on bail. Yesterday, Director Zhang issued an order to suspend the two. If the dereliction of duty is confirmed, they will be handed over to the court for investigation. If they have been falsely accused, they will be reinstated. In the meantime, the court is requested to charge Liu with false accusation. It is reported that Liu Chunji called out "robbery" because he was frustrated by the loss. Negotiations for a settlement are now underway.</p>

<h3>Basketball Star Lu Zhong'en's Eyewitness Account of the Taiwan Uprising: The Leading Thugs Were Taiwanese Vagrants Repatriated from Taiwan Province, Attacking Public Institutions and Destroying Stores and Residences</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhongxing ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying more than 200 Taiwanese civil servants and their families, including the basketball star Lu Jian'en. Lu went to Taipei last May for business. Having personally experienced the major uprising, he told reporters yesterday that he believes that whether the Japanese are secretly involved in this incident is worth considering, because the leading thugs are all Taiwanese vagrants repatriated from Shanghai, Tokyo, Hainan Island, and other places.</p>
<p>Lu described the uprising as follows: The incident occurred at the intersection of Yanging Road and Desheng Street in Taipei, which is a gathering place for open black market vendors. On the evening of February 27th, officials and police from the Monopoly Bureau arrested vendors. In the chaos, a female vendor was injured. People gathered and surrounded the police. The police fired blank shots, but the crowd did not disperse, resulting in one person being shot dead. The crowd surged to the police station and the cold-blooded troops, demanding that the perpetrators be severely punished. That night, the military and police officials agreed to punish the perpetrators, and the crowd dispersed. However, the next morning, they swarmed to the police station again, demanding that the perpetrators be handed over. When their demands were not met, they launched a march, attacking the Monopoly Bureau, burning goods and furniture, and rushing to the Governor's Office. The guards first fired blank shots, but the crowd did not disperse, resulting in a conflict in which several people were shot dead, and the situation escalated further. Taiwanese attacked public institutions everywhere, beat foreigners, and destroyed shops and residences of foreigners.</p>
<p>When the crowd gathered at the train station, the magistrate of Hsinchu County happened to arrive by train on official business. He was not aware of the incident and took out his business card to persuade the crowd to disperse. Unexpectedly, the crowd saw the business card and immediately attacked him with fists and feet, causing him serious injuries. The Taiwanese would ask anyone who looked like a person from another province, "Where are you from? What do you do?" If they could not answer in Taiwanese, they would be beaten. In the first day of the riot, they were empty-handed, but later they used knives and guns, and even children participated.</p>

<p>(1) Deposit Issue</p>
<p>I deposited 1,600 legal tender yuan into the bank on August 16th of the 30th year of the Republic of China, for a one-year term, with a stated weekly interest rate of 8%. By the time it matured, I had returned to my hometown. Now I have several questions: (1) If I want to withdraw the money now, should it be calculated according to the exchange rate of the puppet reserve certificates at that time (two legal tender yuan for one puppet currency yuan)? (2) Can the money be returned according to the Civil Code (1,000 times) or other appropriate ratio? (3) If the bank is unwilling to return the money, can I sue according to the law? (4) What are the procedures for filing a lawsuit?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] You can file a lawsuit with the court to request an increased payment ruling in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration.</p>
<p>(2) Overstepping Authority</p>
<p>Zhou Yongliang asked: (1) Is an engagement made by parents on behalf of their children without the children's consent valid? (2) Does this engagement have any legal binding force on the children? (3) Can the betrothal gifts given at the time of the engagement be recovered upon dissolution of the engagement? (4) Does this engagement without the children's consent need to be dissolved through legal procedures? (5) Is compensation for the other party's losses required upon dissolution? (6) If the person refuses to attend the wedding, is it illegal, and what responsibilities do both parents have?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] 1. An engagement should be made by the man and woman themselves. This is clearly stipulated in Article 972 of the Civil Code, so an engagement made by parents on behalf of their children is legally invalid. 2. If there is no explicit consent, it is not binding. 3. It can be returned. 4. It is invalid from the beginning and does not require dissolution procedures. 5. Those who are not at fault for the dissolution are not liable for damages. 6. They bear no responsibility.</p>

<p>Fire at Seymour Road: Indictment for Neglect of Duty Twenty-three Firefighters and Police Officers Charged with Two Counts</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The prosecution of firefighters and police officers for neglect of duty in the Seymour Road fire case has been concluded by Prosecutor Shen of the District Prosecutor's Office, and two separate indictments have been filed. Shang Zhikui, Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying (all in custody) are charged with robbery for allegedly entering No. 27 and stealing towels, handkerchiefs, and other items while embers were still smoldering. Huang Baoqi (in custody), Li Xun, Zhu Qinglan, Zhou Yueshi, Liu Jihan, Zhao Rongjiang, Huang Keqin, Wang Zhenshan, Yang Abao, Tong Zunwu, Wang Songqing, Tang Changsheng, Liu Lianbi, Yang Yingshan, Luo Qing, Gu Genfu, Wang Zhongxiu, Wang Fengan, and Li Ashan are charged with endangering public safety and theft. The facts, reasons, and applicable laws of the two indictments are as follows: (1) Defendant Shang Zhikui was the squad leader of the Yichang Road fire station, Dai Guangrong was a firefighter at Station No. 11 in the same district, Li Chengjun was a firefighter at Station No. 108, and Cai Zhiying was a firefighter at Station No. 587. On January 22 of this year, at 9:30 PM, a fire broke out at the copper shop at 452 Wuding Road, spreading to the entire Lane 660. By 11:00 AM the next morning, embers were still smoldering. The fire station dispatched Shang Zhikui to lead Dai Guangrong and the other two to guard the fire scene. The four took the opportunity to enter the home of Zhou Xiuzhen at No. 27 in the lane, steal property, and force Zhou Qifang to open the lock on a chest, allowing them to plunder it. Prosecutor Shen believes that Zhou Qifang was forced at the time due to the overwhelming force and the disparity in numbers, reaching a level of irresistible coercion. Referring to the precedent set by the Supreme Court's decision No. 262 of the third year of the Republic of China, Shang Zhikui and the other four defendants are undoubtedly in continuous violation of Article 134, Paragraph 1, and Article 321, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Criminal Code, and the Ordinance for the Punishment of Banditry. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated. (2) Defendant Huang Baoqi was the captain of the Jing'an Temple fire brigade, and Li Xun was the district captain of the Xinzha district. When the fire spread, they led the Jing'an Temple district's Fire Engine No. 30 to the scene. At that time, the Wang family's Western-style house at No. 29 had not yet been affected. Huang Baoqi and Li Xun, with ulterior motives, did not put out the fire. Before the house caught fire, they borrowed a daylight lamp from the Wang family's servant, and searched upstairs and downstairs for valuable items. Half an hour later, a fire broke out on the third floor of the Wang family's house, causing eight Western-style houses in the entire lane to be destroyed. District detachment members Zhu Qing, Zhou Yueshi, and firefighters Liu Jihan, Zhao Rongjiang, Huang Keqin, Wang Zhenshan, Yang Abao, Tong Zunwu, Wang Songqing, Tang Changsheng, Liu Lianbi, Yang Yingshan, Luo Qing, and Gu Genfu took the opportunity to enter No. 29 and steal property. Detachment member Wang Zhongxiu, and firefighters Wang Fengan and Li Ashan, entered No. 27 and stole property. The above-mentioned facts of the crimes are all proven by various victims and witnesses. As Li Xun was the commanding officer, and Huang Baoqi was responsible for putting out the fire at No. 29, yet both intentionally failed to do so, allowing the fire to burn, this passive behavior is equivalent to active arson, and they should be held responsible for the crime of arson. The defendants Zhu Qinglan, Wang Zhongxiu, and the other seventeen had entered No. 29 or No. 27, and valuables were stolen from both locations. Since the defendants had entered these places, they are suspected of violating Article 28, Article 321, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Criminal Code. The defendant Li Xun is suspected of violating Article 15 and Article 173, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and Huang Baoqi is suspected of violating Article 15, Article 173, Paragraph 1, Article 38, and Article 321, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Criminal Code, and shall be punished in accordance with Article 55 of the same law. Because all the defendants are civil servants who committed crimes by taking advantage of their official positions, they should be given a heavier sentence in accordance with Article 134, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated.</p>

<h3>China-England Friendly Football Match Donghua vs. English Navy Clash at Yiyuan This Afternoon at 4:00 PM</h3>
<p>Under the sponsorship of the Sports Association Committee, the China-England friendly football match will be held this afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium, with Donghua, the winning team of this year's Group A League, facing a mixed team of the English Navy organized by the British ships HMS Belfast, Cossack, Guardian, and Comet, which recently came to Shanghai for sightseeing.

The referee is Shen Huichun, and the linesmen are He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang. The lineups for both sides today are announced below.</p>
<p>The English Navy lineup, according to Ensign S. Graham of HMS Belfast, said yesterday: "The English Navy attaches great importance to today's friendly match with Donghua. Therefore, when we had a practice match with the Jewish team in the middle of last week, we carefully selected the elite. However, after the practice match with the Soviet team a few days ago, we found that the coordination of the mixed team was still loose. Therefore, it was decided today that the HMS Belfast team will fight alone in order to obtain familiar coordination and cooperation." The team's goalkeeper Novice is relatively weak, but the team's style is tough and full of energy. The central player, Spies, is the soul of the team, and the Donghua players should be careful.</p>
<p>The Donghua team's battle line was quite difficult to arrange due to Li Yao's departure from Shanghai a few days ago. It was not until 6:30 PM last night that it was announced by Mai Youliang. It is possible that Li Yao will rush back to participate in the battle today. In addition to the original lineup remaining unchanged, the veterans Dai Linjing, Liang Shutang, and Li Ning have also decided to take up the role again. Therefore, the Donghua team's military appearance will be more complete today.</p>

(2) In Group A2, Jiashen won the Shanghai Railway team with a score of 63 to 44.

Chen Qingjiang was active, and Cai Yanxiong and Ji Nankang also attacked unanimously. In the first half, they took the lead with a score of 21 to 10.

When the score was 30 to 14, He Lide of the oil team graduated after committing five fouls and was replaced by Lin Weicong. It is said that Lin was also ill, and the two of them were covered in sweat. It is believed that Lin was able to get rid of the illness.

<h3>Stray Notes from the Sideline</h3>
<p>In yesterday evening's basketball league game, Shen Yi Group Chunmao lost to Shantou team, which was expected, but the crushing defeat by as many as nine points was also due to reasons: At the start of the game, Fu Shan and Tian Lie were not on the court. Chunmao's forwards lacked scoring talent, relying instead on the two guards, Xianzheng and Fuqiang, for points.</p>
<p>Shantou team's He Lide and Cai Yanxiong formed a good partnership. Cai passed into the open space under the basket, and He sprinted to receive the ball, turned around, and shot. He's jumping ability was excellent, and Chunmao could not stop him. In addition, Chen Qingjiang's shooting was smooth, reaching his personal best standard.</p>
<p>Shantou team and Chunmao were long-time rivals, aware of each other's weaknesses. When the score was 13-5, Fu Shan, carrying an injury, entered the game, but his performance was diminished. He was also tightly guarded by Cai Yanxiong, unable to perform. It was not until Shantou team took a commanding lead of 38-18 that Fu Shan scored his first basket.</p>
<p>In the second half, Chunmao's Zheng Jiabiao held up the remaining game, making several corner passes, otherwise the situation would have been even more unthinkable.</p>
<p>In another game, Ren Yu vs. Hai Lu Qing, it was temporarily changed to a friendly match between Ren Yu and Columbus. With an early lead, Ren Yu won against Columbus by one point.</p>
<p>The aim of this game was to exchange skills. Ren Yu no longer had the psychological tension. Everyone maintained their usual level. The whole team played together, with clear offensive routes: finding open spaces, positioning well, ball arriving at the person, skillful cooperation, short passes, stable, beautiful and clear. Compared with the game against Hualian, it was like two different teams.</p>
<p>Columbus is a team with strong defense, but in the second half, Ren Yu penetrated their defenses as if there was no one there. In yesterday's game, Ren Yu's shots were still too hasty and wasteful. (Chang Nian)</p>

<h3>The Four Joint Offices Raised the Approved Limit for Loan Applications That Departments and Bureaus File After the Fact from 50 Million Yuan to 200 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The post of Chairman of the Four Joint Offices has recently been assigned to be temporarily held by the Minister of Finance, Yu Hongjun. According to the organization's constitution, the current Governor of the Central Bank, Zhang Jia'ao, and Deputy Governor, Liu Gongyun, both serve as Directors of the Offices. This morning, at the Executive Yuan meeting, the 339th board meeting was held. In addition to all the original directors attending, Director Zhang Jia'ao, Director Liu Gongyun, as well as the newly appointed Director of the Central Trust Bureau, Wu Rencang, and Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Gu Chunfan, also attended and participated. The meeting was presided over by Deputy Yu, and in addition to passing more than 30 important cases, the handling procedures for loan cases were discussed in detail. Previously, in order to accelerate the handling of loan cases, strive for timeliness, and specify the responsibilities at each stage of the handling process, the Offices formulated a set of measures for the handling and processing of loan cases. Since the implementation of these measures, they have been effective in achieving speed and accuracy. However, as half a year has passed, there are inevitably aspects that need to be supplemented and revised. After the directors expressed their opinions, the key points of revision were decided as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The original measures stipulated that departments and bureaus could file loan applications after they had been processed, with a limit of 50 million yuan. Due to changing circumstances, it is proposed to raise this limit to 200 million yuan. Loan applications below 200 million yuan can be filed after they have been processed. Those above 200 million yuan must be approved by the general office before they can be undertaken. For the Northeast region, the limit is changed to 20 million yuan in circulating currency.</p>
<p>(2) For loan cases that are urgent or handled routinely, if the amount exceeds 200 million yuan, the needs of the borrower should be considered, and a request should be submitted to the Chairman or Deputy Chairman for instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<p>(3) In the future, the loan business of various departments and bureaus should be conducted in coordination with the economic emergency measures plan at any time. They should be responsible for auditing the use of loans by various loan projects. Lin Fengbao, Chairman of the Loan Subcommittee of the Offices, has resigned, and Liu Gongyun has been appointed to take over. He presided over the loan meeting at the general office meeting this afternoon.</p>

<h3>Rumor Has It That Yarn Market Will Reinstate Price Controls: Yarn Factories and Merchants Began to Enter the Market to Buy and Sell Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to implement the economic emergency measures plan, the authorities are preparing to reinstate price controls on cotton yarn. According to sources, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will approve the standard price limit set by the Textile Control Conference. In the future, all market transactions and yarn factory sales must not exceed this price. This new price limit may be slightly higher than the current purchase price. The authorities are already considering this measure. Once it is officially implemented, manufacturers who violate the price controls will be severely punished. Also reported, the cotton yarn group of the Songhu Garrison Command's Economic Investigation Network, after deciding with the Yarn Trade Association to ban over-the-counter transactions, will have the association handle the registration of yarn factories and customer merchants, issue market entry permits. Starting yesterday, new members have begun to participate in market transactions. In total, 883 units have participated in the market, including 284 yarn factories, more than 30 merchants, and the rest are yarn firms.</p>
<h3>Rebound in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market rebounded yesterday. In the early morning, it continued the weakness of the previous day. The opening price was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Soon, Tianjin merchants purchased 32-count and 40-count single yarns for the Red Leader Star and Heavenly Maiden brand cloth factories. The decline stopped immediately, and the situation improved. Prices then rose slowly. Light-weight Shuangma initially traded at 3.12 million, which was actually 80,000 yuan lower than the 3.2 million listed by the Textile Construction Company the previous day. Then, speculative funds took the opportunity to absorb at a low price, and the closing price was 3.3 million. All other yarn counts generally improved by more than 100,000 yuan. 40-count single yarn was particularly scarce, and the price even surpassed 42-count double-strand yarn. It was heard that the underground market was around 7 million yuan, but there was a lack of supply.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction and Flying Flower Industries Reach Agreement</h3>
<p>The Economic Administration Office of the Social Bureau convened a meeting yesterday between Textile Construction Company and the Flying Flower Industry Association regarding the association's social relief case.

The meeting was presided over by Section Chief Zhou Weixin. The main points of the agreement are as follows: (1) Textile Construction Company's Flying Flower Industry Association members have priority for domestic or foreign Flying Flower sales under the same</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Affects Coal Cost: Mine Operators Hope to Adjust Prices – Government to Subsidize Distribution Losses –</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a certain person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, the source of coal in this city is still mainly from Kaifeng. A small amount is also shipped from the northeast. The supply from the Jiaoji Railway and Zhongxing Coal Mines is still uncertain. Currently, no coal is being shipped from Taiwan. Currently, 30% to 40% of the production cost of each coal mine requires foreign exchange. Recently, the foreign exchange rate has been adjusted, increasing by 260%. Therefore, the mine operators hope to adjust and increase the price of coal production by 140% to 160%. As the implementation of economic emergency measures has just begun, it is difficult to adjust prices. However, it is estimated that the production cost of each mine operator must increase by at least 100% in order to barely maintain production. The government has now decided that the distribution price of coal sold to public utilities and transportation businesses will remain the same. However, the economic cost of the miners that is lost will be subsidized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The distribution price of coal to industrial and commercial enterprises is still subject to approval by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After the government adopts the subsidy policy, the actual price that the miners receive will not necessarily cover the cost. However, the government sincerely hopes that the mine operators will strive to conserve the use of equipment and materials, maintain the original coal source, and temporarily refrain from deepening development.</p>
<p>Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company currently charges 27,500 yuan per ton for transporting coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai on behalf of the Fuel Management Committee, which results in significant losses. In addition, the freight charges for railways that transport coal are also insufficient to cover costs. It has been decided that freight charges will remain unchanged, but 70% of the losses will be subsidized by the Ministry of Transportation. The freight cost for foreign ships to transport coal is still US$6.35 per ton and will not be adjusted. terms. (2) Flying flower sold to the Flying Flower Industry Association must be sold to the members. The association must not engage in its own operations. (3) The purchase of cutting knives, silk, and No. 1 broken seeds for re-production (i.e., making 10-count and 5-count cotton yarns) should be handled in accordance with the first agreement.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Slightly Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw fine cloth merchants taking advantage of low prices to absorb, and prices rose slightly. Subsequently, the Textile Construction Company supplied white cloth, and the allocated price of Blue Chicken fine cloth was 140,500 yuan, which was relatively loose. Speculators sold at high prices, and the market was flooded with goods, causing prices to fall at one point. However, due to the strong appetite of the customer, the final price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 154,000 yuan, an increase of 4,500 yuan from the previous day. Five Blessings fine cloth was 151,000 yuan, also an increase of 4,000 yuan. Other brands rose by varying amounts of 2,000 to 4,000 yuan. Dyed cloth, raw cloth, and Shilin cloth sold well. Prices fell from 3,000 to 4,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, while other goods saw mixed gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Trend Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was slightly tight. The association's reference price, 24/2 raw white spot price was 213,000 yuan, and 22 grade medium-fine white was 193,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan. Three-and-a-half car white spot price was 195,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan. Ninth-term warehouse receipt was 186,500 yuan to 7,000-8,000-9,000 yuan, and in the afternoon 191,000 yuan. Taiwan red was 136,500 yuan. Secretary-General's fine sand was initially 183,000-4,000-5,000 yuan, then 6,000 yuan to 6,500 yuan. Numbered goods opened with Shantou-labeled green at 130,000 yuan to 129,500 yuan, and Shunde green at 127,000-8,000-9,000 yuan, totaling slightly less than 200 bags.

<h3>Foreign Stocks Decline</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were stable and then weak yesterday morning. Yisha opened at 20,200 yuan and once saw a high price of 20,700 yuan before leveling off. This was indirectly affected by Shanghai stocks. Guangdong merchants and foreign firms settled their positions and closed at low prices. Rubber stocks were stable. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, steel stocks fell by slightly less than 10%, and the rest fell by a small amount to slightly less than half a percent.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Traded Very Actively</h3>
<p>Government bonds were still active yesterday, with a transaction volume of more than 10 million yuan. Unified C opened at 12,000 yuan, and foreign firms continued to absorb, rising to 13,200 yuan. Many were long in the industry and sold at high prices, retreating to 11,700 yuan. The afternoon closing was still struggling at 12,100 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Shen B, D, and E each rose by 100 yuan to 300 yuan, and Silk C rose by 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rubber Industry Hopes for Eased Import Exchange Settlement and Increased Tariffs for Protection</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are a total of 73 rubber factories in this city, with 342 mixing machines, requiring a total of 1,739.5 tons of rubber per month. There are 40 factories in Tianjin, with 80 existing mixing machines, requiring 270 tons per month. There are also eight factories taken over by the government, requiring 210 tons per month. There are nine factories in Chongqing, with 28 existing mixing machines (excluding Pu Li), requiring 68 tons per month. There are eight factories in Qingdao and Taiwan, requiring 470 tons per month, and about 120 tons are unknown. Shenyang requires 200 tons per month, and Guangzhou requires 450 tons per month. Therefore, all places outside of Shanghai require a total of 1,788 tons. The national demand for raw rubber is 3,527.5 tons per month. The industry has been prosperous in the past. Currently, problems have arisen in the procurement of raw materials, and a crisis is lurking. The supply of raw rubber in our country was originally controlled by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands for export. This control was lifted starting this year. However, since the restriction on imported goods, those holding goods have taken advantage of the situation, and the price per pound has increased from 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan within a month, making it difficult to purchase. Currently, because a portion of raw rubber can be settled with foreign exchange, the price has fallen back to 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. In order to maintain the production of domestic rubber products, it seems that the settlement of imports of rubber with foreign exchange should be eased. As for the large amount of precipitated calcium carbonate needed by the rubber industry every month, there are five domestic calcium carbonate factories that can produce it. However, the current product supply cannot meet the demand. If investment is increased and development is strengthened, it may be possible to achieve self-sufficiency. It has also been found that American car tires mostly use synthetic rubber, and their effectiveness is only 40% that of natural rubber. Therefore, domestic rubber products are better than imported products. It is now heard that British Freedom bicycle tires with 50,000 to 60,000 pairs in stock will be devalued and dumped in Shanghai. Therefore, the industry hopes that the authorities can increase tariffs to protect them.</p>
<h3>Firewood and Charcoal Arrive in Abundance, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Due to excessively high asking prices, the market for bituminous coal fines was sluggish and transactions were infrequent. The market for bituminous coal lumps was relatively firm due to the limited supply of goods. The arrival of white coal lumps from Jiaozuo suddenly increased, and the market price gradually declined. Due to the abundant supply of firewood and charcoal, buyers were cautious, and the market continued to decline.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Unchanged, Soybean Oil Continues to Fall by 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the north and south markets received about 12,000 shi of rice and grains. The market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. The results were similar to the previous day. There was little difference in the price of both japonica and indica rice, but there was still ample stock of river-accumulated rice, so the prospect of prosperity is uncertain.</p>
<p>Wheat flour tended to be firm in the inland, rising by 1,000 yuan, wheat bran remained in a depressed state, falling by another 1,000 yuan. The oil market continued to decline, with raw oil falling by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Soybean oil, sesame oil, and peanut oil all continued to fall by 10,000 yuan. The digestion of soybean cake remained weak, the market atmosphere was lackluster, and it continued to decline by a small amount of just over 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The arrival of soybeans was still continuous, with northeast soybeans strengthening, and Hankou mung beans and broad beans showing a declining trend. The state of black beans was downward, red sorghum fell again by 1,000 yuan, wheat was stable, and cowpeas were stable.

Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Linsen ship sailed to Guangdong yesterday, carrying 6,100+ bags of raw peanuts, 1,000+ bags of beans, 3,900 blocks of soybean cake, 190+ pieces of piece goods, and 70 pieces of cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>Sellers Dump Goods for Cash, Keemun Black Tea Trading Commences</h3>
<p>Due to the stubborn attitudes of both buyers and sellers, there has been a lack of formal transactions in Keemun black tea, which is in demand by British merchants, for days. After the market opened yesterday morning, general financial regulators rushed to sell, and buyers took the opportunity to suppress prices. As a result, although trading began, the market atmosphere frequently revealed weakness, and prices plummeted. Other export green teas, apart from old and inferior goods that have been in storage for many years, are currently difficult to sell. The variety from 1945 and 1946 are still being sought, but the offered price is tight, resulting in unconcluded agreements and little fluctuation. Domestic red-edged tea is still within a narrow range, and the market remains stable.</p>
<h3>Rayon Sales Dull</h3>
<p>Although the allocation of rayon has been reduced, sales were dull, so the market fell by another 100,000 yuan yesterday. Gaoshan Yukari, No. 120 opened at 6.65 million yuan, and closed at 6 million yuan. The afternoon was similar. Asahi Yukari was priced at 5 million to 5.5 million yuan, and someone sold. The result was little trading. Factory agents set a firm price, and there were no transactions from retailers. Brokers had a small absorption at low prices. Foreign firm telegraph quoted grade C at 7.8 million yuan. The price of silk remained unchanged, but trading was minimal.

Shanghai bristles were tight in the foreign markets, and the market rose from 3 million yuan to 3.1 million yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Soap Sales Sluggish, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, as soap sales have been slack and retail sales have been slow, factories have frequently dispatched goods. Although the factory prices of goods dispatched to various distributors are high, some factories have stipulated that those who do not accept dispatched goods will have their distribution qualifications revoked. Therefore, they can only reluctantly accept them, resulting in a daily increase in the number of chips on the market. Although the prices of various brands of soap have not fallen below the factory price, they are on par with the factory price. It was rumored that Xiang Mao had decided to open distribution and that the factory price would be lowered to 90,000 yuan, causing those holding goods to want to compete to sell them.</p>

<h3>Diagnosis Fees and Physician Status</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Society is just that kind of society: those who can increase their own reputation can elevate their own status. Everyone in today's society is like this. Even physicians, whose mission is to "save lives and benefit the people," cannot be an exception. The level of a physician's diagnosis fees is often seen as an indicator of their status. In general society, the status of a physician, the quality of their skills, and the excellence of their abilities are largely judged by the level of their diagnosis fees. Physicians themselves almost undoubtedly accept this as a rule.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that two physicians with similar backgrounds and equal skills may be seen as having different status and abilities simply because their diagnosis fees differ. Even a skilled and highly competent physician might be seen by the general public as having lower status and skills than an incompetent doctor with expensive fees! Don't we often hear people saying things like, "Dr. So-and-so is a highly reputable physician with great status. Their surgical fees must be hundreds of thousands or even millions," or "Dr. So-and-so's medical skills must be excellent and outstanding. Their consultation fee is thirty, fifty, or even a hundred thousand, and a house call costs hundreds of thousands!" Or, "Dr. So-and-so's consultation fee is only a few hundred or thousand; they probably aren't very skilled," or "Dr. So-and-so's surgical fees are less than tens of thousands, not even comparable to the consultation fee of the big-name doctors. They might just be a charlatan!"... Therefore, the amount charged for diagnosis and the level of fees have unconsciously become the sole standard by which the general public judges a physician's status and skill.</p>
<p>Because the general public equates high diagnosis fees with high status and skill, clever physicians who "know the times" seize upon this popular psychology. They use various methods to raise their fees, thereby increasing their own status and position. Otherwise, they would lower their own value, fail to demonstrate their noble physician status, and be scorned by patients as "cheap goods are no good!" In the self-perception of a large number of physicians, diagnosis fees, whether high or low, have unconsciously become a determinant of their own reputation, position, and status.</p>
<p>In reality, this kind of thinking is very incorrect, this kind of psychology is very inappropriate, and this kind of view is completely wrong and utterly unacceptable. In fact, a physician's status should not be elevated by excessively high diagnosis fees, and the quality of their skills should definitely not be judged by the level of their fees. There are certainly skilled physicians who charge high fees, but who dares to say that there are no quacks with a flashy style among them? There may be physicians with ordinary skills who charge low fees, but there may also be competent and honest good doctors.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is unreasonable and does not correspond to the truth to view the level of diagnosis fees as a standard for a physician's status and skill.</p>
<p>Let us investigate: if the general public holds the incorrect psychological notion that "high diagnosis fees equal high physician status" when dealing with medical problems, and physicians take advantage of this unreasonable popular psychology in their diagnosis and treatment work, what impact will this have on society and the public? I believe that it will very obviously lead to a very negative phenomenon and facts that are extremely unfavorable to the general public.</p>
<p>This is such an obvious fact! Raising diagnosis fees inevitably reduces the opportunity for medical treatment for patients with limited financial means. Everyone knows that society should not be a society of a few wealthy people, but a society belonging to the entire populace. "Serving society" is our sole creed as physicians, isn't it? "Benefiting the people" is also our sole mission as physicians, isn't it? However, the "society" we serve should not be limited to the society of a few wealthy people; it should also be the society of the majority of common people. The world we save and the people we benefit should not be limited to the world and people of a few propertied individuals; it should also be the world and people of the majority of the working class. Raising diagnosis fees and reducing the number of patients treated directly contradicts the purpose of serving society and the mission of saving lives and benefiting the people. If a physician's diagnosis fees are set excessively high, not only will the majority of the lower classes be unable to seek treatment when they are sick, but even patients from the middle class with moderate financial means will feel that medical care is too expensive, making it easy to get sick but difficult to seek diagnosis and treatment!</p>
<p>If doctors can truly understand the real meaning of "serving society," and do not elevate their own status by raising diagnosis fees and reducing opportunities for diagnosis and treatment for the general working class, but instead cater to the tastes of the public and meet the needs of patients from the middle and lower classes, reducing diagnosis fees as much as possible to expand the scope of medical services, then they are the physicians welcomed by the masses in today's society. Only physicians who are welcomed by the masses can be considered to have truly fulfilled the mission of "serving society" and truly deserving of the status and virtue of a physician. As for the general public, if they can also change their erroneous psychology of viewing the level of a physician's diagnosis fees as an indicator of their status, and instead use their work skills, service spirit, attitude towards patients, and personal virtue as standards for a physician's status and character, then that is a reasonable and correct view. Using this reasonable view and correct notion as a standard for choosing a doctor when sick will prevent being fooled by quack doctors and ensure satisfactory medical results.</p>
<h3>Review of Combined Injection of Glucose Calcium and Vitamin C</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Song Guobin, Recorded by Song Enhao</p>
<p>Before the invention of specific drugs for tuberculosis, chemical therapy had undergone countless changes in the past thirty years. At present, the most popular and widespread chemical therapy used by general physicians is the combined injection of glucose calcium and Vitamin C. From major cities to remote villages, all physicians know how to use it, and I have never heard any criticism of it. I am not talented, but I have doubts about it. Please let me explain the reasons.</p>
<p>(1) During the active phase of tuberculosis, the patient's minerals and calcium are consumed in large quantities. The former is called demineralization, and the latter is called decalcification. Fever, expectoration, tooth decay, and phosphate in urine are all manifestations of these phenomena. Therefore, patients need to supplement calcium (recalcification) and minerals (remineralization). Thus, glucose calcium injection is included as one of the chemical therapies.</p>
<p>(2) Acidic substances may dissolve calcium. For this reason, acidic foods are strictly prohibited in the diet of tuberculosis patients. For example, alcohol, ethanol, beer, vinegar, coffee, lemons, oranges, apples, tomatoes, spinach, etc., contain various acids, such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid, so they are all prohibited. After consuming these acidic foods, the consumption of calcium in the body will increase. Drugs that are acidic are naturally not suitable for tuberculosis patients.</p>
<p>(3) Based on the two phenomena listed above, it can be seen that calcium agents are suitable for tuberculosis patients, and acidic drugs are not suitable. Vitamin C is nothing else; its scientific name is ascorbic acid. Combined injection with glucose calcium is obviously a contradictory effect. After injection, the calcium loses its effect. Although there is no significant damage, there is no benefit either.</p>
<p>(4) Furthermore, calcium injections are not suitable for general tuberculosis patients. For example, in patients with fibrotic and calcified tuberculosis, the calcium in the body has reached a saturation level, and calcium injections may not be beneficial. In elderly patients, whose blood vessels have hardened, injecting calcium agents will only make the hardening worse. Therefore, glucose calcium injections are only suitable for patients with active tuberculosis. The combined injection with Vitamin C is even more unreasonable.</p>
<h3>After Reading "The Problem of the Spleen"</h3>
<p>— Yao Xingshu</p>
<p>Although I am not a sentimental person, after reading Mr. Yu Yunxiu's "The Problem of the Spleen" (see the first issue of this journal), I cannot help but feel something. I write these disorganized thoughts, with no great arguments, just to fill the space.</p>
<p>1. Japanese doctors call our ancient and modern term "spleen," which represents the digestive gland, "pancreas." I have been thinking about it for a long time, but I can't figure out the reason. Many of our modern medical books are translated from Japanese or written with reference to Japanese books, so the term "pancreas" is used quite a bit. This "pancreas" character looks like a Chinese character, but it is actually made in Japan. The Japanese have their own pronunciation for it, but because it has the moon radical next to the "cui" character, we read it as "cui." The term "pancreas" originally had problems. Chinese people are not always ignorant, and the term approved by our Ministry of Education has been changed to "pancreas." The name "pancreas" is probably considered colloquial. This soft, reddish-yellow thing is also found in pigs. Ordinary people call it "pancreas." Before there was snow cream or turtle oil, women used it to prevent wrinkles on their hands in winter. According to Mr. Yu, if we don't forget our ancestors, the name "pancreas" also has problems and is worth discussing. We will put that aside for now. In any case, the two characters "pancreas" should not be used anymore. However, I accidentally flipped to page 51 of Volume 2 of the National Elementary School Natural Science Textbook, which still uses these two characters, while the middle school physiology and hygiene book uses "pancreas." It is said that there are many questionable aspects to the content of national textbooks, and this is naturally a very minor one.</p>
<p>2. The Japanese call what we call "spleen" "pancreas," and use "spleen" to name something we don't know. We are still following this, which is Mr. Yu's "Problem of the Spleen." The Japanese can be said to be good at stirring things up and calling a deer a horse. The Japanese are really "idiots." When we open a Japanese medical book, the "ying" character in "nutrition" is written as "rong." "Nutrition" is a physiological term, while "rongyang" has other meanings. The so-called raising parents and supporting them is what filial sons say to their fathers. The Japanese have always messed up Chinese characters. For example, we humbly call "my place" and "my shop" "bi chu" and "bi dian," but the Japanese write them as "bi chu" and "bi dian," regardless of whether they are fair and honest. If Chinese people imitate them, it would become a big joke, wouldn't it? Recently, I read Mr. Chen Fangzhi's book on acute and chronic infectious diseases, which uses the two characters "rongyang" extensively, which is quite strange. Mr. Chen's book is very valuable and I would like to recommend it to readers. I am being overly critical, and it seems a bit like I am finding fault with Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>3. There is another term that the Japanese have mixed up with us. Japanese doctors often call their private clinics "hospital," which is not surprising. What we call hospitals, they call "sanatorium." A hospital with only one shopfront in Shanghai makes knowledgeable people feel cold, but the Japanese see it as a matter of course. Nowadays, no one is talking about learning from Japan anymore—in fact, people are probably afraid that they will never learn from them—if someone dares to call their clinic a hospital, they must be careful that health officials will come looking for trouble.</p>
<p>In short, even if these are small matters, if others have already made a mistake, why should we repeat it?</p>
<h3>Review of the Use of "Streptomycin" in the Treatment of Tuberculosis (4)</h3>
<p>— Yang Shida</p>
<p>(4) Tuberculous Empyema</p>
<p>Dr. Ying Xiao once used "Streptomycin" to treat seven cases of tuberculous chronic empyema. Four of them only used intrapleural injection, and did not achieve any effect. The other three used intrapleural lavage and intramuscular injection at the same time, and only one of them undoubtedly achieved an effect. In 1942, this patient requested thoracotomy to remove three ribs and the intercostal muscles attached to them; the purpose was to drain the pus and mixed infected tracheo-pleural fistula. Under these circumstances, "Streptomycin" can be sprayed on the pleura with a nebulizer, and at the same time, a large amount of intramuscular injection can be applied. The tracheo-pleural fistula closed very quickly. After three months of treatment, the tuberculosis bacteria in the pus were also eliminated. Previously, this individual had been observed for four years, and various treatments had been tried without success.</p>
<p>It is quite surprising that the bactericidal effect of "Streptomycin" cannot be fully exerted in tuberculous empyema. This is probably because empyema fluid is usually acidic, but "Streptomycin" can easily exert its power in neutral or alkaline conditions. At the same time, it should be noted that tuberculosis is a granulomatous proliferation, not a simple tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>(5) Tuberculous Fistula</p>
<p>Dr. Ying Xiao once used "Streptomycin" to treat fifteen patients with epidermal fistulas, and tuberculosis bacteria were found in the pus of all of them. One of them had multiple lesions, such as sinus tracts of the submandibular lymph nodes, sinus tracts of the inguinal lymph nodes, and sinus tracts of the thoracic cage. The lesions were located in the neck and axillary lymph nodes in about six patients, in the thoracic cage in two patients, in the abdominal wall in one patient, and in the scrotum in two patients. Two patients had rib tuberculosis, and one patient had tuberculous scalp ulcer, which occurred after osteotomy and brain tuberculoma resection surgery. The patient with brain tuberculoma only received six months of "Streptomycin" treatment, and the neurological effect was gradually achieved, probably due to the success of the surgery. Furthermore, that patient died elsewhere six months later.</p>
<p>After four to six weeks of injection, all fifteen patients achieved an effect: the pus was eliminated and the wound was closed, which is proof of the effectiveness. However, if treatment is stopped at this time, short-term recurrence is common. Therefore, after superficial success is achieved, treatment must be continued for several weeks. The effect obtained later can be maintained for a longer period. Among the fifteen patients, the sinus tracts of ten patients had been closed for four to twelve months, three patients remained in a recurring state, and two patients had recently recovered and were still undergoing treatment. In order to obtain long-term and complete recovery, it is considered appropriate to continue injecting two centimeters of "Streptomycin" daily for three to four months.</p>
<p>"Streptomycin" can indeed close several stubborn sinus tracts, such as thoracic tuberculosis and tuberculous lymphadenitis. In order to avoid recurrence, treatment should continue for several weeks after the wound has closed.</p>
<p>(6) Tuberculosis of the Genitourinary System</p>
<p>According to Dr. Ying Xiao's experience, "Streptomycin" can stop the progression of tuberculous cystitis and maintain a stable state. In most cases, it only has palliative value. It has no therapeutic effect on kidney tuberculosis. If tuberculous cystitis is selected at an earlier stage, when the bladder wall has not yet undergone a high degree of fibrosis, the micro-effects after treatment will be more significant.</p>
<p>In these specially selected cases, although the tuberculosis bacteria in the urine have been confirmed to be eliminated by animal inoculation, there is still a tendency for them to reappear. If tuberculosis bacteria are rediscovered in the urine after a long period of treatment, it can be determined that those tuberculosis bacteria have drug-resistant power in vitro. In Dr. Ying Xiao's treatment of fifteen patients, the symptoms were often alleviated for a long time in about 50% of the cases. Two of the earliest treated patients had been treated for eighteen years and continued to experience symptom alleviation, but a small number of tuberculosis bacteria were still occasionally found in the urine. Among the fifteen patients, two had tuberculous epididymitis, causing scrotal sinus tracts. Tuberculosis bacteria were also found in the pus. After several weeks of treatment, the sinus tracts closed, and after the treatment was stopped, each remained in a state of recovery for six months and ten months.</p>
<p>In summary: "Streptomycin" can achieve temporary effects in the treatment of tuberculous cystitis, and true effects on kidney tuberculosis are rarely seen. Therefore, "Streptomycin" therapy cannot replace surgery for unilateral kidney tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(7) Tuberculosis of Bones and Joints</p>
<p>Dr. Ying Xiao has treated five cases of tuberculosis of bones and joints. Generally speaking, the external effect is significant.</p>
<p>(8) Adult Surgical Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>"Streptomycin" has been used simultaneously with surgery in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of injection was given before the surgery. As for the injection after the surgery, its main purpose is to prevent the occurrence of tuberculous complications. Generally speaking, "Streptomycin" can help the body recover.

<h3>Guangling Flower Society - Yangzhou Continuing the Dream (12)</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>The location of the Guangling Flower Society was near the old city's Eight Alleys in present-day Yangzhou, and it operated from the first to the fourth year of the Republic of China (1912-1915). Although named a flower society, it was actually a teahouse, but it was clearly different from the average teahouse in terms of elegance. The three large rooms facing south were designated as the rooms for Qin, Chess, Calligraphy, and Painting. Judging from this name, it is not difficult to understand the composition of the teahouse's patrons and their activities. A shed was built in front of the hall, which was also used for selling tea. The surrounding flowers and trees were lush, giving it a small garden-like charm. At the very beginning, there was a row of cloisters. At the end of the cloisters was a "music room" facing south. The owner, Mr. Yan, was not primarily interested in making a profit, but in having the pleasure of music and strings. Therefore, every day after sunset and the lights were lit, the drums and flutes resounded in the music room, and the singing was loud and clear. At this time, most of the tea patrons had already left one after another, and those who remained were either people who loved to sing a song or those who appreciated the music.</p>
<p>In this flower society, there were three people who were often praised: Xie Chunjiang, who sang Kunqu opera; Wang Lang, who played the flute; and Guangxia, who played the Guqin. Guangxia was a monk from the Hua Temple, Wang Lang was a Taoist priest from the Zanhua Palace, and Xie Chunjiang had donated to become a candidate for the salt and fire envoy, so he could be considered a man who had "read the books of sages." It was truly a combination of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.</p>
<p>Taoist priests are often good at playing musical instruments, and Wang Lang was famous for his flute. Guangxia, although a monk, did not abstain from meat, so he had grown fat and full. However, he played the Guqin very well, and no one in Yangzhou could match him. If you closed your eyes and listened attentively to his clear Qin sounds, it would truly make you dispel worldly worries and feel as if you were in another noble universe. You would no longer think that the person playing the Qin in front of you was a drunken monk. Speaking of Xie Chunjiang, it is said that his family used to be well-off, but because he loved Kunqu opera and did not engage in production, he gradually became impoverished over time. However, he still enjoyed it. A person familiar with him told the author: "I remember one day, in a light drizzle, he was walking through Biluo Spring Alley towards the parade ground when he suddenly heard a family in the alley teaching young prostitutes how to sing opera songs. He stopped and leaned against the door, listening attentively and tapping his toes to the beat. After a long time, an old friend happened to pass by and saw him standing there foolishly. He was very surprised, and stepped forward to pat him on the shoulder and call 'Chun Weng,' which made him realize that he had been standing there for a long time and his clothes were all wet. His friend teased him and said, 'Chun Weng! Your behavior is almost the same as Jia Baoyu in the Dream of the Red Chamber!' They couldn't help but burst into laughter." It turned out that Xie Chunjiang was an opera fanatic.</p>
<p>The lifespan of this flower society was only a short four years before it closed down. The three people mentioned above, who were often praised in the flower society, also scattered and eventually found their final resting places. Regardless of whether "silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as meat," the performances of these three in terms of silk, bamboo, and meat can never be heard again. Even if there are successors, who else can be as kind as Mr. Yan and open another Guangling Flower Society?</p>

<p>— Zhu Qishi</p>
<p>Mr. Niu’s – "Daily Lesson"</p>
<p>— Hei Pingfu</p>
<p>It's no wonder. Ever since Mr. Niu married Mrs. Niu, he hasn't given her a single good day. In these three "years of hardship," time has flown by for over a thousand days, and there have been hardly any stretches of four or five days where they could afford to cook regularly. In other words, Mr. Niu's skills are rarely enough to prevent his family from running out of food for four or five consecutive days. What's worse, even two meals a day are often uncertain. As a result, Mr. Niu's entire family looks gaunt and pale today.</p>
<p>Initially, Mrs. Niu fully understood Mr. Niu's situation. At that time, the world was in chaos, and the enemy and puppets were rampant. Mr. Niu, with his scholar's integrity, would rather suffer from hunger and cold than seek "cultivation, cultivation" from certain "prominent" classmates or relatives. On the other hand, Mrs. Niu was also quite good. Although she felt constantly inferior due to the intense spiritual pressure around her, she still believed that "it's better to starve to death than to be a traitor." Therefore, Mr. and Mrs. Niu endured hardships together, waiting for the light without complaint. They thought, "Once the country is victorious, everything will be fine. Suffering a little now is nothing when we're young."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a full year passed, and Mr. Niu's family was still worried about three meals a day and living hand to mouth. As a result, Mrs. Niu began to look down on Mr. Niu. She often said to him coldly, "You couldn't make a name for yourself during the time of the traitors, but that was for the sake of the country. However, it's been so long since the devils collapsed, and yet you haven't managed to improve things even slightly. The puppet currency was issued by the traitors, so it wouldn't come your way, but the legal tender also disappears for three to five days at a time. Could it be that the country no longer recognizes you as its citizen? There are four hundred and fifty million compatriots, everyone…"</p>
<p>Mr. Niu's face burned, and his heart ached. He couldn't answer his wife's sarcastic remarks. He secretly rolled his eyes at her, thinking that he was indeed letting himself down. However, these kinds of cold words were just the beginning of Mrs. Niu's daily "lesson." Whenever there was no firewood or rice, this "lesson" would always escalate into a fight with Mr. Niu, sometimes without a resolution.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Niu often thought to himself, "If I had known I would end up in this situation, I wouldn't have married her even if she had beaten me to death. Even a clever woman can't cook without rice. I used to think she was like Wang Baochuan, and that eighteen years in a cold cave would be no problem. Who knew that after only three years, she would look down on me so much that I could never turn things around?" However, whenever Mr. Niu thought this, Mrs. Niu seemed to read his mind and instantly transformed from a state of cold sarcasm to an uncontrollable storm. At this point, Mr. Niu would also lose his temper and blurt out all his grievances, leading to an "irreconcilable" shouting match.</p>
<p>Mrs. Niu's first sentence usually involved a favorable reference: "When I married you, your family wasn't overflowing with gold and silver. To be honest, I don't care about being poor. If I were materialistic, I wouldn't have married you in the first place. Don't you think about it yourself? The world is big, and there are poor people everywhere, but how many unlucky people are there like you who have no food to eat no matter where you go? Tell me, how many people like you are there in the world?" These "ironclad facts" would infuriate Mr. Niu, making his eyes burn with anger. The more ashamed he felt, the more she would repeat these words endlessly until Mr. Niu couldn't bear it anymore and stormed out of the house in a huff. However, their young child, who had just learned to talk, would chase after him, crying and shouting. Mr. Niu felt trapped. He thought, "It's not a solution to keep arguing. I should focus on figuring out how to get food!" The child said from the side, "Daddy, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I want to eat!"</p>
<p>The next day, Mr. Niu's "daily lesson" started again, just like yesterday. Meanwhile, the radio in the neighbor's house was playing "Red Mane Steed," the opera that caused him the most mental distress.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 197</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I wondered why we were standing. Tsurumi was putting on a show there, so why didn't we sit down and enjoy it? I called Yaoqun and Huchen over and chose a nearby table to sit down. When the waiter saw us, he immediately came over. Yaoqun and I were preoccupied, so we each ordered an iced coffee, but Huchen ordered two servings of Water Chestnut Jelly, two servings of Ice Cream, and four servings of pastries, preparing for a big feast.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his appetite was not to be satisfied. As soon as the waiter who was serving us had written down our orders and scurried away, and as Huchen was rubbing his fists, ready to enjoy his meal, we suddenly heard a burst of gunfire in the distance—bang...bang bang bang...bang—</p>
<p>This gunshot pattern, "one three one", was precisely the signal for Commander W's troops to begin their operation. As soon as the gunfire sounded, a moment of silence fell inside and outside the door. The reason for this silence was that we, on our side, knew that the commando team that had been sent out had returned and were sending a signal to notify us, so of course we quieted down and watched the enemy's movements. The enemy, on the other hand, was suddenly startled by the gunfire and couldn't figure out what was going on, so they couldn't help but be surprised and tense. As a result, this moment of silence was created.</p>
<p>But this silence passed in the blink of an eye. We saw the outside of the door first stir up, and after a flurry of running footsteps, an enemy scout burst into the hall, rushing towards the wide-eyed, astonished "Commander Jin" and raising his hand:</p>
<p>"Report—the enemy is surrounding us from three sides, there are many of them, it's over!"</p>
<p>After giving his report, he turned to run. However, the floor of this fire hall was entirely made of high-quality willow wood rhombuses, which were incomparably hard, planed to a high gloss, and covered with a thick layer of wax, making it very slippery. The scout, turning too quickly and wearing a pair of clunky nail boots, lost his footing and immediately went sprawling, face-planting like a hungry dog lunging for shit.</p>
<p>Before the fellow could even stand up, a burst of laughter was heard, followed by a clear, sweet, and incomparably smooth female voice shouting loudly from behind us:</p>
<p>"Tsurumi-dage..." The Tokyo accent was spot-on.</p>
<p>I turned around and saw a graceful woman walking swiftly and lightly towards Tsurumi from the elevator area. As she walked, she said with a smile:</p>
<p>"I'm late... I should be responsible for introducing you all!" The "you all" of course referred to Tsurumi and the "Commander Jin."</p>
<p>Her demeanor was indeed elegant and poised. Compared to the "Commander Jin", she was obviously refined and he was vulgar, and they were not comparable. But compared to our Yaoqun, one felt that one was vigorous and graceful, and the other was delicate and charming.</p>
<p>"Ah, Miss Pingzi...!" Tsurumi bowed formally.</p>
<p>"Dage good you." Although Pingzi was wearing a Beijing-style cheongsam, she performed a Japanese bow: "Let me introduce you two," she bowed to the "Commander Jin"; "This is Tsurumi Tamakun of the General Staff, a newly accepted student of Old Master Konoe!" She bowed to Tsurumi again; "This is Miss Inoue Yoneko, the new commander of the Second Action Team under Commander Kawashima of the North China Garrison Headquarters." Pingzi emphasized the identities of both sides by mentioning the names of Konoe and Kawashima Yoshiko.</p>
<p>In this urgent and chaotic scene, this calm social interlude suddenly intruded, and this extremely disharmonious focus was concentrated on the fake "Commander Jin," Yoneko. She seemed embarrassed and couldn't turn her face around, making it a bit awkward for her to get off the stage. I wanted to see how this fellow would deal with this embarrassing situation, so I watched her very carefully.</p>

<h3>Chang Banqing is Dead</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>Chang Banqing has already been executed by shooting in the Shanghai Prison. Our only feeling about the death of such a villainous and scandalous traitor is that he has consumed too much prison food until now!</p>
<p>Chang Yuqing was the "Chairman" of some "Yellow Way Society". What we want to specifically point out is whether the miasma-like thinking of this "Yellow Way Society" and the like has been completely eradicated.</p>
<p>People are enthusiastically debating the issue of atomic energy, while what about us? A year ago, there was the so-called "Yiguandao" mega-case, and recently in Shanghai, there was also something about fox fire burning, something like "fox fire not more than three times" and other "news"! To this day, there is still a small shop like a temple on Lafayette Road, with vermillion plaques and golden characters, proclaiming "Great Immortal Wang" in large letters. As for the practice of spirit writing, it is even more extremely "prosperous". It is said that those "spirit writing altars" are even organized to unite, and in addition to "uniformly disseminating news from the immortal world," they also want to uniformly organize things like "spring relief" and "spring prayers"—in other words, they are mutually supporting each other and intensifying their efforts to collect money!</p>
<p>The blindly following citizens are simply "ignorant." When education becomes a luxury, "ignorance" is forgivable, but "ignorance" is also one of the most dangerous enemies of our old nation, because there are people who are taking advantage of this "ignorant" mentality for ulterior motives. When the world is chaotic, the years are lean, and society is unstable, this kind of ambition forms the "Yellow Way Society" and "Yiguandao"!</p>
<p>During the occupation of Shanghai, the trend of seeking spirits through spirit writing was particularly prevalent, mainly because the enemy deliberately condoned it: on the one hand, they feared that the Chinese people would not be "stupid," and on the other hand, they may have wanted to cultivate the power of people like Chang Yuqing.</p>
<p>The country must keep up with the times, and the miasma-like morbidities must be swept away! The Ministry of Internal Affairs has already ordered the prohibition of the bad habit of taking "immortal prescriptions." Shanghai should take a step further than the mainland. We demand a "cleaning movement" to kick out these "great immortals" and "spirit writing altars"!</p>
<h3>Hell's Chapter</h3>
<p>— Chang Kong</p>
<p>Perhaps I shouldn't have a bad temper, but as soon as I hear that someone has gone into the water, attached himself to the enemy, no matter if he (she) only held a small position the size of a sesame seed, I always detest them to the extreme.</p>
<p>Perhaps he has his own hardships?</p>
<p>But I always believe that as long as he has eaten the enemy's "salary", he is always shameful.</p>
<p>But things often go beyond the norm. Many people once received "favors" from the enemy before the War of Resistance, but during the later stages of the war, they went to the rear to "wash" themselves, and when victory came, they were also "Chongqing people" in Shanghai. They didn't even wipe the shit off their asses, aren't they ashamed?</p>
<p>Because I am naturally disgusted with these "neither donkey nor horse" characters, I am very afraid of interacting with them. But here is an analogy: to say that a person is afraid of someone interfering with his "freedom", so he locks himself in his room every day, but the "unfree" hand will knock on your "door" "outside" the door. Can this "door" hold off external interference? This is almost a dream.</p>
<p>Based on this reason, every time I meet those "yin-yang people", I hope to have less contact with them, but they come to your side, pat you on the shoulder, pull your hand, they want to be intimately close to you. You say: don't you extend your hand? You say you can refuse to shake hands with such a person in person?</p>
<p>Based on this reason, it is no wonder that measures such as "killing relatives for justice" are "extremely rare" now.</p>
<h3>Selling Official Positions – The Current State of Corruption in the Former Qing Officialdom</h3>
<p>— Aiju</p>
<p>I followed my elders to the capital in the year of Ji Mao and only left Beijing in the year of Geng Zi. What I heard and saw in twenty years was considerable. When I was young, I rarely went out, and when I grew older, I devoted myself to studying for the imperial examinations, so I never wrote it down in books, but used it as material for conversation when friends gathered. Before Tian You, Prince Gong was in power. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, Prince Li held the central government for the longest time. There was a second-hand clothing store inside Houmen called Baofengcheng. The person in charge was surnamed Tian. He was outside the former three gates every day (Qianmen, Xuanwu, Chongwen, were the former three gates. All prosperous shops were outside these three gates.) socializing with food and drink. At first, I didn't know what he was doing. During the years of Xin Mao and Ren Chen, two of my cousins entered the capital as Daotai with special imperial edicts. In the late spring of Xin Mao, my elder cousin and cousin met Tian in Wanfuju on Yangmei Zhuxie Street. Someone who knew him asked if he had any valuable gifts recently. Tian said he had two inkstones that could be called rare treasures. My cousin also needed to send gifts to someone at the time, so he said, "Can I go to Houmen with you tomorrow to take a look?" After making an appointment, he went to Baofengcheng with a friend the next day. The storefront was extremely spacious. Inside the counter were sable and fox furs and other treasures, hanging on all four walls, which were already beautiful beyond compare. Then they entered a fine room filled with porcelain, copper, jade, stones, calligraphy, steles, and other antiques, even more dazzling. His friend secretly told his cousin that everything else could be chosen at will, but the two inkstones would be shown by him, and he should not touch them. After they sat down, they saw that the inkstones were a Han tile and a red silk Duan inkstone, placed on a large table by the window, with extremely exquisite decorations, covered with glass. Tian took out a small booklet, explaining that the tile inkstone was collected by Ruan Yuan, and the stone inkstone belonged to Mingzhu (a powerful minister during the Kangxi era), all recorded in books and passed down in an orderly manner, recently held by an old family who wished to sell them at a good price. My cousin, knowing that it would be difficult to obtain, only laid out a medium-quality sable coat with a sea otter collar and discussed the price with him. Tian then summoned his subordinate to take out an account book and show it, and the price was so high that it was beyond imagination. My cousin reluctantly said no and returned home with his friend. In the evening, he changed cups and drank in his residence on Dongcheng Root in Qianmen. My cousin said to someone, "What I saw today was dazzling. Please quickly explain this riddle." Someone said: "This is the outer residence of a certain prince. Half of the exquisite objects are taken from the palace (referring to the prince's residence using Mencius's words). The price for wanting to see the prince's face is a certain amount, the price for wanting to get an introduction of eight lines (not a tea ticket, but from the eunuchs of his party) is a certain amount, and the price for wanting to point out a certain lucrative position (such as the silk weaving bureau, customs, provincial financial commissioners, and provincial education commissioners of Sichuan and Guangdong) is a certain amount. The prices in the book are not prices of goods, but prices of events. After negotiation, it is ostensibly a gift sent to the prince's residence, in order to achieve various purposes, while the goods are still circulating within the residence. The technique is so clever! This kind of mysterious method was created by the previous prince, and the later prince followed the rules. The bannermen who opened offices in various provinces also followed suit, such as Yu Kuan, the governor of Bian, and Hai Xiaofeng, the governor of Gan, who were the most notable. Alas, noble relatives, important border guards, but so corrupt! How can the country not perish? Recently, in the case of the foreign tiger, Miss Bohr's confession repeatedly involved important government officials. Although the matter may not be true, there is no smoke without fire. I sincerely hope that those people will correct themselves if they have done wrong, and if they have not, they should encourage themselves.</p>
<h3>Haimen Mountain Song</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>(1) The four-line mountain song, two lines are true, the last two lines make people laugh; the lazy toad flaps its wings and flies to the East Sea, the small paddy chicken struggles on the mountain corner. (捔 pronounced xuē, meaning collision.)</p>
<p>(2) The lying girl sings a lying song, cooked tofu has more bones; the wind blows the stone, it turns without stopping, making a rat's nest on the cat's head.</p>
<h3>Junru Su Yun and Others – Recollections of Old Actors, Second of the Young Male Actors</h3>
<p>— Tingsong</p>
<p>When Fang Yantuan's performances were at their peak, Gui Guan's collaboration with Lao Tan in "Zonghuai Zhou," his collaboration with Luo Baisui in "Welcome to the Third Grade," his collaboration with Ziyun Xiaofu in "Yutangchun," and his collaboration with Chen Delin and Qian Jinfu in "North and South Harmony" -- if Gui Guan was absent from any of these plays, the entire audience would be unhappy. He was so famous at the time. Xin Pei, discussing the talent of young male actors at the time, sighed and said, "De Junru and Zhu Suyun were all beautiful young male actors, but they were not as outstanding as Leng Xian." De was the grandson of Grand Secretary Mu Zhang'a and the nephew of the Sacrificial Wine Sa Lian. Because Grand Secretary Mu was the presiding examiner of the Jiyou imperial examination and Sa Gong must have been in attendance, De Gong was able to avoid revealing his identity. However, his Suona and Erhuang tunes, sung high into the clouds, such as Luo Cheng's Calling at the Pass and Xiao Xian, were truly unmatched at the time. Zhu was most skilled in plays such as Shooting the Halberd at Baimen Tower, and people all said that he had truly obtained Xiao Xiang's true teachings, unparalleled in his time, and also excelled at eight kinds of jokes. He wrote Liu-style calligraphy with extremely beautiful strokes. Officials in the capital would often ask him to write name cards, and the literary officials all sighed in their inferiority. However, because he was short in stature, Jiao Tian often joked, "You are an exquisite miniature landscape on stage!" However, his collaboration with Xiao Duo (i.e., Yang Guiyun's son) in plays such as "Contented Marriage," "Rouge Trial," and "First Book of Rainbow Pass" was truly unmatched by other famous actors because of his romance, elegance, mastery of both civil and military skills, so every performance was always packed. "Rouge Trial" has become a lost art, and Zhu Suyun's beauty as E Qiuhun, with her graceful demeanor and expressive glances, and her unspoken understanding with Xiao Duo at the beginning of the play, with her father Gui Yun's consort, Madame Gong, watching coldly from the sidelines, her expression was somewhat like the matchmaker Liu in "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and the Wang Po in "Picking the Curtain and Tailoring Clothes," but more restrained. Such a fine play cannot be seen again today.</p>
<h3>Sound Recording Telephone – A Novel Tool</h3>
<p>— Ya Mu</p>
<p>The world is vast, and there is nothing that is not strange, especially the new inventions of the scientific community. Recently, the clever Swiss have again presented the world with a newly invented "sound recording telephone"!</p>
<p>Readers must be eager to know what this "sound recording telephone" is like, so let me give a brief introduction. According to news from the British scientific community, this new device has the special function of recording text in addition to the general features of automatic operation. For example, if you have to go out on business and cannot answer the phone yourself, but you are not comfortable letting someone else answer it for you, then the most appropriate way is to install a "sound recording telephone". It will automatically tell the person calling that "I'm very sorry, our host is not at home at the moment, please tell us what you want so that we can record it." In this way, the caller will do as told, and the "sound recording telephone" will trouble itself to record these meanings on the phone, so that you can see everything clearly as soon as you return.</p>
<p>Naturally, sound recording telephones are extremely effective communication tools for individuals, businesses, and any organization, but I wonder when they will be brought to China.</p>

<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Ou</p>
<p>"General Manager," A Shi walked in from outside the door, speaking Mandarin with a Cantonese accent to his master, "The assistant managers from the China Tea Company are on the phone!"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, I'll go listen to the call and come back." The fat man suddenly became happy, and rolled out like a ball.</p>
<p>The smile on Lao Zhu's face disappeared, and he felt a little embarrassed. He had not held excessive hopes for the donation campaign for the troops. He already knew how disheartened the people in the rear had become in the past year or two. But he was an enthusiastic person, with a kind of naive optimism, always wanting to do his best and make the greatest contribution to this country battered by wind and rain. Xu Shaoming was not only his classmate, but also someone he dared not offend for a reason. However, under the belief that fleeing in a hurry and rushing to transport supplies was the top priority, he had become firm with him today.</p>
<p>When it really came to the point of no return, he could use a form of coercion against Lao Xu, but he didn't want to do that. And the matter of donating money to support the troops, whenever he pondered it alone, he never felt it was very meaningful. Everything in the country was so bad in normal times, the soldiers' treatment was so poor in normal times, now it's like a patient reaching a critical moment, and then wanting to inject a stimulant to save their life. Whether it would really work, even the most optimistic person like him couldn't say. The reason why he enthusiastically initiated and completed this campaign this time was nothing more than to boost morale and inspire spirits. How much money could be raised was secondary. He was simply indignant at Xu Shao's refusal to donate a single hair, which is why he was bothering him. But Xu Shaoming only agreed to donate 50,000 yuan!</p>
<p>"...The only way to make him submit is to use a method of application. If he persists, I might have to play a trick on him."</p>
<p>He stretched out a long leg and continued to sit on the sofa in contemplation, as he had been before.</p>
<p>He waited for about twenty minutes before Xu Shaoming excitedly rushed in.</p>
<p>"Lao Zhu, are you eating here? I still have a bottle of Moutai. Let's finish it all before we flee. Hahaha!" The phone call he received had obviously given him excellent news, which made him much happier than before, and he had forgotten Lao Zhu's purpose in coming.</p>
<p>"Drinking and eating, of course I'll join!" In front of people, Lao Zhu always acted happy as usual. "What good news did you get, brother? Is it... did someone else put out cheap goods?"</p>
<p>The person being asked smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>"I've bought enough goods! It's about the trucks. The fat man hesitated slightly, originally not wanting to say, but this matter made him so excited that he couldn't hold back. "The China Tea Company has six five-ton trucks that were originally going to Hengyang to rush to transport tea. Later, everyone advised their assistant managers not to do such a foolish thing anymore. Going to Hengyang at this time is like courting death. It's better to pay some freight and let us rush out more supplies. Their assistant managers are also smart people and already agreed yesterday. But there were too many people who wanted them, so they didn't decide who to give them to at the time. He called me just now and agreed to give me three. This makes things much easier!" As he spoke, he kept rubbing his ten fat fingers, which looked like ginseng, full of triumph. (Thirteen)</p>
