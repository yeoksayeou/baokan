<h3>經濟改革實施辦法　分組研討限期完成　財產捐座談會擴大舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕全國經委會十四日午後舉行第十一次會議，秘書處報告為討論開征豺產捐事所將舉行之擴大座談會詳細辦法，人選方面決定除經委會委員外，邀集參政會主席團，參政會駐會委員，立法院五委會委長，立院財政，經濟兩委會委員及京·滬兩地參議會議長，其他各地議長將用書面徵求意見，舉行日期則由張兼委長與立院吳副院長，政院王副院長，參會邵秘長等共同決定。討論綱要將根據原財產捐征課方案項且擬定，就名稱，征課對象，起征點，征課方式等分別討論，至對於抗不遵交應如何處理，僑胞應否課征，在華外商如何處理，咸將為討論對象。秘書處另一報告為經濟改革方案實施辦法，分組研討，決定以方案中每一事業為主，分成經濟·財政·交通·水利·農林·工業·對外貿易·工業·礦業，地政，糧食，勞資問題，物價問題等十二個小組，每組指定一二人召集，由主管部長担任，組員則由各組召集人於會內·會外延攬學者及專家參與，并限兩週內完成。會中除聽取並通過上述兩報告外，並討論兩要案，其一為國營事業人員待遇辦法，原則決定國營事業人員待遇較其他公務人員高出百分之三十，若有盈餘，年終並得獎金三個月，此案細則尙待討論，決另組小組由翁文灝，陳啟天，俞大維，谷正綱，吳蘊初，潘序倫，劉振東七委員先予審查。另一條為經濟部所提外商請求在華設廠辦法，會中以我對外交所採能度·張院長今日聲明已明白關明，無庸另為討論，決議送政院。</p>
<h3>財產捐方案擬就　將提立院等三機構核議　徴課對象以大戶為主體</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕全國經委會對財產捐徵課問題，前已決定約立法院，參政會就技術問題作縝密研討，茲悉豺部已擬就此項特捐之徵課方案，將提請全經會及立法院，參政會聯席會議，俟獲通過後即成定案，方案要點如下：</p>
<p>甲，原則說明：（一）現時一般人所主張一次財產稅并非普通財產稅，征收財產所孳生之收益。財產收益可年年征課，而一次財產稅係以財產之本身為對象，僅課一次。（二）我國目前舉辦財產捐，除財政目的外，兼有平均財貨之使命。如對物課稅，不僅對象太多，抑且易涉苛擾，故原則上應以個人為課稅主體，而以列舉之財產項目為課稅客體。（三）個人財產多寡，雖不易普遍調查，而一地方之富戶鉅室，則每為一般人所週知，故財產捐之舉辦，在提綱紮領以大戶為主體。</p>
<p>乙，征課對象：豺產捐以個人所有財產總額之現值超過十億元以上者征課之，以個人為課稅主體，血以下列財產為課稅客體、（一）土地房屋，（二）存款外匯，公債股票，（三）黃金外幣，（四）國人在外國之動產不動產，（五）獨資或合夥營業之財產凈值，（六）私人所有之一切交通工具，（其）機械貨物。以上所列各項財產項目在核計個人財產總額時，不重復課征，並得减除其實際負債額。</p>
<p>丙，稅率：（一）超過十億元者，就其超過額征收百分之四。（二）超過廿億元者，就其超過額征收百分之六。（三）超過五十億元者，就其超過額征收百分之九。（四）超過一百億元者，就其超過額征收百分之十二。（五）超遇二百億元者，就其超過額征收百分之十六。（六）超過五百億元者，就其超過額征收百分之廿。（七）超過一千億元者，就其超過額征收百分之廿六。（八）超過二千億元者，就其超過額征收百分之卅二。（九）超過三千億元者，就其超過須征收百分之四十，（十）五千億元以上者，一律征收百分之五十。</p>
<p>丁，征課方式：分申報，提名，告密，調查等方式，征收機關為直接稅征收機關，其未設直接稅征收機關之地，由一般稅務機關代徵。</p>

<h3>勝利兩週年紀念　張院長廣播演說</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕今日為勝利兩週紀念日，行政院張院長，特應美國廣播公司之邀，在京廣播演說，其演詞全文如次：</p>
<p>兩年以前，中國人民以無限的歡忻，慶祝對日勝利紀念日，　鵬這個日子表示中華民族已在抵抗强暴侵略者的鬥爭中，獲得勝利，同時也表示世界民主與和平的思想，究竟戰勝了法西斯與侵略思想。一個和平繁榮的時期，在遠東降臨，中國固受其認利，其他東方國家也受其福利、同時也是世界和平繁榮的基石。</p>
<p>戰後兩年的事實，證明了聯合國家在戰爭中雖然獲得勝利，但永久和平的建立，還須要更多的努力。中國在戰後所遭受艱難阻碍、不下於戰時，中國現在正致力於恢復統一，掃除障碍，從事建設，改善民生，爭取正確的民主制度，深信這種努力，將非任何力量所能阻撓，並深信惟有這些目標達成以後，遠東與世界的和平才能陵得確實保證。</p>
<h3>開放私人貿易前夕　盟總公布入境須知</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十四日電〕盟軍總部於重新開放有限制數人貿易之前夕，發表關於外國商人入境手續及住宿之詳細須知，盟軍總部經濟科學組對外貿易科科長麥德漢特　編謂，商人入境者，分為四類，最大之一類為明日抵日本之四百私人貿易代表，第二類為從事銀行保險及其他業務貿易等之「業務代表」人數較少，第三　　「投資代表」，須稍遲後始　入境，第四類包括「政府貿易代表」，凡屬於盟國駐日代表國辦理政府與政府間貿易事宜者，或辦理「特種商業談判者」、目前即可入境。日本政府貿易局在貿易上可負最大實際上之任務。麥氏宣稱：「私人貿易代表」可個別與日本僅售貨商與貿易局洽商再交盟軍總部核可·經總部核准後，貿易局可簽訂一合同，並發給出口證，貨價以通用之外國貨幣付款，或以協議可以兌換互相當貨幣付款。麥氏謂，盟軍總部對日本商品不負責任，亦不提供保證，惟如貨品到達目的地港口三十日內發生爭執時，則由盟總決定，在私人航運機構未成立前，由美國航務委員會負責港埠事宜，東京，名古屋，大阪等處之旅館，每日食宿須美金十元，在可自由兌換之貨幣規定前，先發行特種付款證，以便貿易商購買，美金日圓可在指定之兌換處購買、按照美金一元換五十日圓之匯率，凡不能立即兌換特種付款證之貨幣，必須於抵日後四十八小時內全部交出，離境時限定撓帶一百五十美元現鈔，不能超過此數，日圓不許兌換，貿易商可利用國際郵遞與日本本國之郵遞，但不准使用盟國軍郵。國外商業電報准予拍發，乘坐火車或汽車，須以美金付款，貿易商亦可利用自己之運輸辦法，貿易商與佔領無關之國家國民享有同等法律地位。麥氏謂，彼等須遵守佔領政府統治下之刑法。</p>
<h3>王寵惠談對日和約　侵略狀態應消除　對外貿易不能縱其傾銷</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕法學家國府委員王寵惠博士，十四日午後接見本報記者，談對日和約問題甚詳，渠認為對日和約必須依照兩大原則訂定，其一為根本消滅日本之侵略，另一為　日本人民以和平生存之機會。關於前者，日本之侵略性成體系之存在必須從軍事·經濟·敎育·文化·宣傳各方面加以消除，並妥善保持此種消除侵略之狀態。關於後者，得以和平生存，應為日本工商業發展之限度，不能縱其恢復對外貿易之傾銷能力，更進而再從事經濟侵略，壓迫亞洲其他各國國民生計。王氏同意天皇制為日本侵略體系之中心，自國際和平及日本國民自由幸福觀之，均不應繼續存在，唯有共和政體之實現，方能使日人自天皇萬能之神權迷信中醒悟。至於琉球之地位，渠調：絕對不能歸還日本，而宜採取國際共管或委託統治（委託於聯合國機構或某國某數國），使為一有力基地，以為西太平洋之安定力。關於賠償問題，王氏堅稱：我應獲得最大部份，東北消曰蘇聯拆遷之資產，雖非賠償問題，然我國仍有權且應該在和會中提出要求索還補償。渠曾於談話中數度言及第一次大戰後對德和約之殷鑒，因缺乏澈底並有效消除德國恢復侵略能力之規定，而致德國不數十年即再起為志。渠力主和約之簽訂並非和平之最後保障，對日之管制，應繼續不斷，以監視其對和約之完全履行，直至聯合國之政策完全實現，而後方可言及終止佔領。</p>
<h3>中蘇締約兩週紀念　首都各報盼蘇嚴格履行義務　尊重中國領土主權完整</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕今日為中蘇條約簽訂兩週年紀念日，此問各報咸就此發表評論，盼蘇聯遵守條約義務，改進邦交，永敦友好。中央日報社論極簡短，僅二百數十字，該報直率指出：「今大約問題，不在此條約本身，而在簽約雙方是否誠　嚴格履行條約約精神與條文，如雙方誠懇嚴格履行，則中蘇間之長期友誼與合作，自可獲得保證。一關於接收旅大及新　問題，該報希望蘇聯「嚴格履行條約義務，勿使條約成為具文」。和平日報首分析中蘇條約之三大建義，為防止日本再侵略，互不干涉內政，蘇聯尊重中國領土主權完整。該報指出蘇方阻投我國接收旅大之口實，均為一曲解條條文」。該報結論中認為中蘇合作有其必要，我當堅守中蘇條約立場，謀兩國懸案的解決，並盼蘇遵守條約義務。大剛報對條約未忠實履行，條約精　神未維持或發揮，感慨萬千。該報於敘述蘇軍組撓接收東北，拆運工業或備，外蒙軍入侵新疆及拒絕接收旅大等事實後稱：「我們對於友邦蘇聯，實在再沒有不加懷疑與失望的理由」。該報以蘇聯是否交還旅大為維特中蘇條約的試金石，且希望蘇聯「毅然斷絕對中共陰謀作亂的許多援助」否則中蘇關係不睦，對蘇亦無利益。新民報亦對兩年來中蘇邦交之發展「廢然興嘆」。該報指出兩年前國人以沉重心情接受該約，國家已付出相當代價，結果兩年來種種事件，均導中蘇邦交於歧途。該報不贊成盲目反蘇，「亦極不願意我們的締約國，有超越條約的範圍，損及國家領土主權的事情發生。我們希望蘇聯朋友能和我們一樣，重視條約尊嚴，不要越雷池一步，只有以中蘇友好同盟條約為基石，才能建立起中蘇兩國間的友好和平關係。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕十四日為中　友好條約簽訂兩週年紀念日，中央日報簡短持术之社論頗可代表政府之立楊，外部則不發表文告。記者分訪若干重要人士，請就今日中蘇外交局勢，加以論列，茲分誌如後。立法院吳副院長　城談稱：「中蘇兩國邦交有無。增進，胥屬於兩年來條約之是否履行，誰不能履行，誰即負有責任，亦即為吾人不能完全收復東北主權之原因所在。此原因則是不能履行條約者所負之責，殊覺遺憾——余　合後中蘇仍應努力作到使條約能完全履行，以維護兩國　睦邦誼」。</p>
<h3>應注意條約精神　係基於平等友好　王寵惠談巾蘇條約</h3>
<p>王府委寵惠以為締約國雙方應尊重條約之精神，而不應斤斤於字句之片面解釋。中蘇友好條約之各種規定中，雖予蘇聯若干方便權益，但其基本精神則為平等·友好。今日之爭執，在於中國在其領土行使主權發生問題，此決非條約之本意。就法律觀點言，對於中蘇友好條約之履行，於情·於埋·於法，我方均立於不拔之地。中蘇間邦交如受任何影響、我國自無責任。」其兩通邊政之革命先進，追述中蘇簽約之際，我方純係被動，彼時伊　事　已起，方期藉此倏約以安西域，孰知兩年以後，　息仍不稍已，東陲禍端又生。渠以為　動有比下塲，主動亦至多不過若是。　　為建國革命史程中之重要工作、革命外交當不顧一切，掃除惡勢力之障碍，惟渠仍以為做人立國，應明「不為已甚」之至言，應負責任者當速謀中蘇間問題癥結之消解，實為大幸！蒙藏委會白副委長雲梯以為中蘇條約未見完全履行，乃昭彰之事實。至外蒙疆界綫之根據，亦曾確開載於條約，實不容擅為主張，企圖片面變更。內外蒙之問，本相安無事，乃突生疆界問題，實非無因，至盼此等無理之爭，得因中蘇條約之東獲重視而消弭於無形。此外曾任駐蘇大使之參政會邵秘長力子及中蘇條約簽訂者王外長世杰，亦為記者訪問之對象，然彼等均保持沉默。</p>
<p>〔合眾社南京十四日電〕據此間政治觀察家意見，中蘇友好互助條約簽字兩年以後，中國目前發覺其與蘇聯之關係，遠較一九四五年八月時為不友好，並且無論在精神上，抑在行動上，實際上已完全無同盟之存在。此種徴象，可由簽約兩週紀念並無慶祝函電可見。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽十四日電〕十四日為中蘇方好條約簽訂兩周年。潘各報均著文詳論，對樊遲遲未能接收，表示遺憾。</p>
<h3>魏使赴廣州視察　昨在滬竟日與各界晤談　並訪孫夫人詢時局意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕魏德　特使昨日在滬忙於與各界人士晤談，徴詢對時局意見。上午九時半，海員黨部主委楊虎往訪，十時許何德奎往訪未晤。十時半左右，特使接見民社黨革新派要員伍憲子，汪世銘，姚永勵及郭沫若，沙千里，董時進，胡厥文，沈體蘭等民盟代表。聞往訪者對時局頗多建議，談話在一小時以上。據汪世銘告記者：「今日晤魏使時，曾提出一簡要之備忘錄，內容主要有三點：（一）設法早日結束國內軍事。（二）第三方面之民主勢力，應在中國政治上佔有地位。（三）政治應作改革，民權應有保障」。午後魏使驅車拜訪孫夫人宋慶齡女士，探詢對時局之意見。晚六時，代理總領事邁亞假漢彌爾登大樓舉行酒會，介紹本市中外各界人士與特使晤面，出處者吳市長，趙曾珏，趙祖康，李馥蓀，丁貴堂，貝祖貽，凃羽卿，胡世勳等四十餘人，至八時許始盡歡而散。魏使等一行，定今晨八時左右飛赴廣州視察。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中國農民黨領袖董時進昨應邀與魏特使晤談時，曾提交備忘錄，內容計分六點：（一）　亂的根源，（二）政治的弱點，（三）經濟的窮困，（四）農民的特殊痛苦，（五）中國問題的癥結，（六）中國與世界。</p>
<h3>傳魏使將提建議　聯合國參與調處我局勢</h3>
<p>〔合眾社本埠訊〕消息靈通人士談稱，魏德邁考察中國局勢後將向杜魯門提出之三大計劃，其中一項將建議由聯合國調停中國目前局勢，蓋為免使中國成為美蘇戰爭之導火綫，聯合國理應採取此一行動故也，聞此一計劃或亦包括託管中國某某數區之建議在內。其餘二項計劃，魏德邁或將建議除維持對中國之正常外交關係外，美國之援助與勢力均廳完全退出中國，或實行大規模之充份援助加以督導，藉以實現美國在該處之目的。此間可靠方面談述魏德邁所負使命之重要因素，有如下述數端：</p>
<p>（一）魏德連現正在縝密搜集事實，鄭重作其最後之決議。</p>
<p>（二）魏德邁完全以客觀態度，進行調查研究工作，絕不受中國任何人士之友誼影響。</p>
<p>（三）魏德邁對任何黨團，不稍偏袒。</p>
<p>（四）魏德邁對國民黨政府之缺點，亦非漢然不知。渠曾在中國供職，曾蕩得中國政府之良好合作，但對於官方情報及其他方面之報道，皆將權衡其輕重。</p>
<p>（五）統德邁所負之使命乃以「遇阻共產主義」為前提，故所需指出者即中共區域不能任其成為蘇聯之衛星地區。</p>
<p>（六）中國組織聯合政府已屬不可能，蓋共產黨不能引為滿足，且欲繼續鬥爭，以達到其全面控制之目的。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕美財長斯奈德今於記者招待會稱，彼並未獲悉魏德遇對於財政援舉事，會有任何建議，若有任何建議時，亦必須由國際貨幣問題全國顧問會批准·</p>

<h3>青年軍代表參觀歸來談　延安正在新生中　居民重返家園自黑暗轉至光明</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年軍第二零二師第二旅靑年士兵代表韓伯樑，林志楨，張廣發三人，於上月乘機飛往延安，參觀延安克復後之現況，已於本月十日返抵上海，韓伯樑氏十四日在西體育會路新華一邨第二旅政治部，對記者談延安近况稱：</p>
<p>共匪盤據時期</p>
<p>（甲）共匪在陝北之政治情形：（一）黨高於一切，完全採獨裁暴力手段，（二）特務組織嚴密，（三）奴役陜北人民以　固其偽政權，（四）以民主口號欺驪人民。（乙）經濟方面：（一）利用現實掠奪政策，（二）利用鬥爭清算名義，利誘貧民，使小康者變為貧困，貧困者淪為匪徒，（三）暴力的土地政策，將人民土地淸算後，政府便用邊帶同地主收回，作另行分配，藉以增加軍費，（四）利用種植鴉片，抽取捐稅，以毒化人民來補救財政的不足，鼓勵人民種植鴉片，將所收種鴉片運至邊境售賣。（丙）敎育文化方面：（一）造成黨化的工具，以培權黨負為敎育，而非為培植國家人才而敎育，（二）使學生均為共匪忠實奴隸，（三）求學機會不均等，全延安祇有二家小學，一家師範，除却共匪幹部子弟有免費讀書機會外，人民須繳納學費，且至十五歲後須由共匪管束，致人民不敢送兒女入學，遂造成陝北文盲嚴重現教。</p>
<p>國軍收復以後</p>
<p>自國軍克復延安後，經過半年來施政後的延安，已有長足進步，在共匪盤据時期，這共有三萬二千多人口的小城，彼等經過十三年來「敢怒不敢言痛苦」，今已有二萬一千多人口重返家國，開始安居樂業，他們過去很少有穿過一襲完整衣衫，如今已穿上政府救濟衣服，每人均穿上一套白衫黑褲子，淸潔整齊行頭，顯出徽笑的面龐，象徵一種愉悅現象，表露彼等巳自黑暗轉至光明一。參觀團會參觀民眾敎育館，大一廳陳列着共匪遺留下的鴉片種子一，此為共匪茶毒人民鐵證。繼參一觀「國軍人民服務處」，工作人員正忙於辦理急賑工作，家庭互助社人員，竟日為來歸人民解決困難，凡是五歲以上小孩，可免費送保國民小學讀書，由縣政府供艙課本，當「參觀團」參加五家小學學生　歌大會時，天眞活潑的學生，均能唱「蔣主席為人民大救星」的秧歌。據延安朱保黎專員報告，各種小規模工業巳開始籌辦，且已凖備　辦延安中學，最遺憾者，延安尙來有一家醫院，工務科巳在修築沿城公路，農行已開始辦理農貸，在「政治重於軍事口號下」，各級人員均抱負重建陝北信心，政府並希　有志靑年能踴躍參加建設大西北工作。</p>

<h3>蘇北災區俯瞰　一片汪洋人烟絕跡　大好田畝被水吞沒</h3>
<p>— 本報記者兪振基</p>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕在空中百度以上的酷熟天氣中，記者等隨着水利部長薛寫弼，次長沈百先等視察蘇北水災。一行二十餘人，從紫金山麓出發，飛過長江淮水分水嶺，沿着多災多難的津浦路，飛到徐州，再環着微山湖，打了一個轉，折到沂水，沭水上下游，翱翔於臨沂沭陽等地上空，常常三十分鐘五十分鐘地飛行於水天一色中。回來時，誰的心情都是沉重的。</p>
<p>六小時的緊張飛行，八百餘哩的空中俯視，發現了一個驚心動魄的事實，就在離開上海僅僅四百公里的地區，有着土海面積十倍以上的土地，為大水淹浸着，比上海人口多出兩倍以上的老百姓，正在洪水裏過着水深火熱的生活，這些水，有的退了些、有的正繼續上漲中，要是不速加整治，那末災區面積必將愈見擴大，與長江距離亦應見接近，到那時，不但整個蘇北將盡成澤國，就是繁華的京滬地區，亦會全部陸沉的。</p>
<p>今年蘇北的水災，起因是由於雨水過多，加上了山東那方面下來的水，事情就更精了。蘇北大水地區，最先露在我們眼底的，是蘇魯邊境的微山湖，這條在抗戰時間聞名中外的大湖，沒有太湖的漪麗，更比不上昆比明的滇池，即使有一點美麗，尙值得留戀的話，亦為一望無情的大水，塗上了憂鬱的灰色，我們是十二點左右飛過的，一面吃着水利部為我們準備的午點，一面看地面上（應該說是水面上）有沒有烟囱在冒烟。有一大段地區，根本沒有房屋，當然談不上有烟囱；有些地方，偶而看到一兩棟房子，旁邊還　立着一兩顆枯樹，但烟囱中沒有冒一些烟，用望遠鏡看，沒有人跡，或許早巳搬家了。一兩尺的水，將路淹得乾乾凈凈，有幾條船，在搬東西。我們以沉痛心情，看「陸地行舟」的奇跡。一位上海同業間這一帶為水所淹的地區，有幾個跑馬　那樣大？記者無法回答，轉而詢間旁邊的水利專家，這位老兄沒有到過上海，只指着地圖對記者說：這一帶被水淹的區域、有山東一部份及江蘇的沛縣，及徐州的一部份，你說有幾個上海六。</p>
<p>在隴海路邳縣所屬的黃集，大許家等地，我們又看到高地的民屋，四周被大水包園的鏡頭，在天空中隱約可看到為冰所淹的道路所組成的綫條，水有半尺或一尺深，不過好些地方是沒有水的乾地，有些地方水已退了些。據去年來過的同業說，今年蘇北的水沒有去年大。</p>
<p>天太熱了，飛機又飛得低，有人支持不了，靠資假睡，只有幾個專家仍在翻地圖，拍照相。這一解默，保持不了多久，即為薛部長打破：「飛機已經飛到蘇北最大的災區了！」每一飛機　口都有一副焦急的限光在看，好傢伙，水多大呀工並且都是灰黑色的，至少二三尺，或許不止，這些從宿遷附近起，一直往北走，沐陽，東海，灌雲，多少個縣，幾十萬畝最好的田，都泡在水裘，至少有太湖那樣大，沒有人烟，頂多看到幾顆樹的頂子。飛機在泥水上盤旋，不相信這裏以前是陸地，連船也看不到一條，簡直是大海，這條海不知吞沒了多少人的血汗，毀滅了多少人的家庭，兩倍於上海人口以上的同胞，正在水深火熱之中，數倍於上海大的地區，全部為水浸着，這水可能有天會到上海來的，上海的同胞，千萬不要以「隔岸　　」的態度看這事。</p>
<h3>社論　兩年後的日本將如何？</h3>
<p>兩年前的今天，日本經過幾天的猶豫之後，終於正式接受了波茨坦宣言，日昰並向全國人民發表廣播演說，宣佈日本已向聯合國投降；於是第二次大戰經過八年的砲火而告終了。所以八月十五日，在人類歷史上，尤其是在中國近代史上，是最光榮的一日。每年過到道個偉大的勝利紀念日，論理我們應該以最典奮的情緒與最愉快的心胸來迎接這個日子的到來；但是我們在兩年之後，今天遇到這個劃時代的紀念日，却百感交集，千言萬語，眞不知從何處說起！</p>
<p>我們不必緬懷過去，也不必暗望將來，只要看昨天東京盟軍最高統帥部所發表開放日本對外貿易的條例，也就够使我們感慨糸之的了。這個條例的內容，規定開放日本對外貿易四項辦法。（一）將各國至日貿易的外國商人，分為四類：1私人貿易之代表；2運輪保險等業之代表；3投資商人之代表；4政府代表。（二）私人貿易之代表與日商或日本商務部有所接洽，均須獲得盟軍總部的批准。（三）日本商務部所發給之出口許可證，均須獲得盟軍總部的批准。（四）日本貨物之價格，一律以美元標價。在表面直上　來，開放日本私人對外貿易，似乎是「局部的」開放，　　一切均須聽命於盟軍總部，並不許北自由發展、但是按之實際，開放日本私人對外貿易，不論從經濟的觀點或是從政治的角度去觀察，對於戰敗的日本，終是一大鼓勵、無怪一般日人又那裏竊笑了。被盟國擊敗的日本，不到兩年的工夫，已在那　設想翻身，這對於戰勝的中國，怎能不視為足資警惕呢？</p>
<p>美國的對日政策，由久遠約眼光看，自多可以非議的地方，但是美國扶持戰敗的日本，一方面想减輕美國佔領日本的費用，另一方面，又想日本在遠東將來能替她效勞，一如當年英日同盟時代的日本之對英，麥帥的對日政策，所以能獲得美國人民的　護，原因成就在此。這種只類目前的政策，足以引起不可測的後息，我們固應居於諍友之列，喚翻美國朝野的警覺，但是我們最重要的，還在反躬自省，盡其在我。第一，中國對於日本是十戰勝國之一，在遠東委員會內，也是亭有否決權的四强之一，盟國對日政策的決定，我國也有充分的發言權，乃我國外交當局對於不利於我國的決議，是否曾經據理力爭？第二，開放日本私人對外貿易，雖為明軍總部的命令，但是各國是否開放對日貿易，各該國均有自由決權，我們明知在目前開放日本貿易，對於中國害多而利少，為什麽人民儘管反對，而政府仍決定開放？第三，我們假定政府決定開放對日貿易，也確有充分的理由，就是今後的一切對日貿易，均在政商嚴厲管制之下，不致聽任日本貨排山倒海而來，但是我們仍要請問政府，對於將來日本貨物的大量走私，是否已有嚴格預防的辦法？對於扶助國內工業不受開放到日貿易的影響，是否巳有具體辦法？現在全國的工商界都皇皇不可終日，政府是否能向他們作有力的保談呢？</p>
<p>要之，今天是日本接受波茨坦宣誓的紀念日，同時也是開放日本對外貿易的一天？我們一則以喜中中則以懼。我們固然願意給日本人民一個和平共處的機會，但為確保勝利起見，應該處處防範日本的翻身，使這一部侵略的列車不再能開動。日本私人對外貿易的開放，雖為局部的開放，雖受盟軍總部的管理，但這是日本屆膝後開始翻身的第一步，使我們不得不提高對於日本的警覺。”本在接受波茨坦宣言之後，不及兩年，，和約尙未簽訂，就能獲得私人對外貿易的開放；並獲得美國的貸軟·載敗國趨向復興的神速，在現代史上幾無倫比、則以今日的德國而論，也不免相形見絀。美國雖然也想先扶持德國、但是在英美進行談判提高德國工業水　的時候，因為有法國的堅決反對，也就不得不作為罷論了。戰時的法國，其地位原不知我，而何以戰後的法國，能保持其在歐洲固有的地位，又怎枕運用其外交手段，以確保其對於德國的有利地位、這是最值得我們注意的。</p>
<h3>捐款救災！</h3>
<p>最近一月來，國內災情的報道，紛至沓來；除了黃河的大汛而外，兩廣，四川、蘇北，也在那裏鬧水災，災情的慘重，觸目驚心。人民在抗戰期間前熬了八年，而今又受天災的浩刦，眞是如何的不幸呀！</p>
<p>中國到現在為止，是以農立國的國家，人民百分之八十是農民，大家靠着耕種生活；農村經濟的榮枯，就是國民經濟興衰唯一的尺度。老實說、今日各地的農村，即使不發生意外的天災，也已陷於破產的邊綠，一般農民在生活的重担之下，幾乎連氣也喘不過來；那裘還能再經得起天災的打擊！我們研究各省發生水災的原因，都是由於農田水利的失修。我國自古以來，向極重視農田水利的興革，不僅要使農村不發生水災，而且也要使農村不致患旱災。但是近十年來，因為抗戰緣故，在敵人佔領下的地區，遭盡敵人的蹂躪，固已田團荒蕪，就是在後方的農村，一則因為科學的不發達，再則　為戰時無力顧及，也已造成了農村的不景氣。今年水災的發生，可以說是天災，也可以說是人禍，而在遵受共匪破壞後的辯北　尤其是大災人禍相為　果！</p>
<p>雨廣是我國革命的策源地，四川為我國抗戰的根據地，而降北又是國家今日剿匪戡亂的第一綫。全國人員眼見上述各地千百萬的災民，衣食無着，投靠無門，自不能袖手慶觀。尤其是我們上海的市民，一直過着正常的生活，對於這些嗷嗷待哺的災民，當更能推己及人，自動奮發、踴躍輸將、以减少他們的痛苦。</p>

<h3>舞廳若果禁絕　交際花將充斥　暗中活躍如故徒減稅收　不如寓禁於徴一舉兩得</h3>
<p>下月起開始禁開新舞塲</p>
<p>〔本報　〕目「總動員節的辦法」規定禁絕全國營業性舞　後，滬上人士對此看法，咸有「煞風景」之感。尤使財政當局感覺頭痛者，稅收方面勢將因此遭受打擊，减少一筆大收入。蓋本市財政收入，向來以「娛樂稅」爲主要來源之一，近數月來雖營業稅已佔第一位，然娛樂稅仍佔　個市收入之第二位。據財政局統計：本市娛樂稅中，無歷收入約佔十億元，其他酒吧間。咖啡館有跳舞設備者約六億元，適帶菜館有跳　設備之娛樂稅部份，共計約近二十億元，佔整個娛樂稅收入百分之四十　。</p>
<p>市政當局對此着法：認爲上海跳舞，如欲完全禁絕，決非如理想中之易易。蓋一般依此爲生者，可能以「偸天換日」之方法，依然暗中活躍如故。故有人認爲與其禁而不絕，　使　政减少收入，不如「寓禁於徵」，提高稅收，反可一舉兩得。</p>
<p>實施細則在審核中</p>
<p>社會局長吳開先日前曾爲此事，奉召晉京，有所商洽，昨晨業已返滬，據吳氏語記者稱：禁舞原則業經全國經濟委會通過，詳細實施辦法正由內政部社會部會同有關機關審核中。惟目前已規定自九月一日起，先不准設立新舞廳，同時對原有之舞　實行分期取締。「分期」之解釋，係指依此爲生之舞女，以及從業員，可有充分之時間與機　從事　業而言。但對自帶舞侶進入類似國際飯店之音樂應時，則不在此限。</p>
<p>吳氏末謂：如上海營業舞廳禁絕後，則舞女勢將全部流入變相之「交際花」陣營中，將來舞客携帶此類女郞，涉足於音樂咖啡廳中，豈非換湯不換藥？且舞女過去多在警局領有執照，管理較易，今後舞廳取消後，此批舞女旣不再受警局之管制，則流弊叢生，乃意中事。再者，上海環境特異，不若南京杭州等地尚有名勝山水可，供　覺。且滬上人口又較他處　多，因缺乏正當娛樂、致過去不少人士多以歌台舞榭，作爲「遊山玩水」之好去處。故如禁舞之後，吾人必須考慮者，即如何導引彼等走上正當娛樂之途。</p>
<p>舞女實數千七百人</p>
<p>經記者調查上海已登記之舞女，總數共四千八百二十二人，但其中不少因署期輟業，或轉往香港靑島等地「掏金」，或以改業方式下嫁者，爲數殊衆，故據警局之最近統計，實際人數僅一千七百七十六人。然此項數字一俟秋凉後，又將激增。至於上海全市現有經塲，計有大滬，仙樂·高士滿，維也納，米高梅，麗都，百樂門，新仙林，大都會，小都會，立德爾，金山，遠東，揚子，中央，大東，新都會，勝利，大路，大華，新華，高舉，偉運，華都，皇宮等廿餘家。此外酒吧間中設有舞女者，總數亦達四百二十四人之多</p>
<p>當此禁舞聲中，同時已引起美國記者之極大「興趣」。合眾社一位記者說：「上海社會局長對這事不大贊成：他有二個理由，（一）上　有二萬人靠遭撈什子度日。（二）跳舞一禁止，外國水手來岸上玩時，倒需要供給他們其他的玩意兒」。</p>

<h3>遺書荒謬　至死不悟　敵溧陽憲兵隊軍曹　富田德昨執行槍決　臨刑倔強猶呼「天皇萬歲」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〔日本戰犯溧陽憲兵隊軍曹富田德，前經軍事法庭判處死刑，昨晨在上海監獄刑塲執行槍決。該犯　得措詞狂妄，臨刑猶呼「天皇萬歲」，至死不悟，可見軍國主義遣毒之深，當此日本力謀再起之時，殊値吾人警惕。</p>
<p>策反專員，慘遭毒手</p>
<p>富田德年二十九，日本愛知縣人，溧陽日本憲兵隊軍曹，淪陷時期有溧陽人狄維城者，黃埔軍校畢業，曾任忠義救國軍第六支隊中校參謀主任，及該軍總部上校督練官，幷以少將銜回鄉任策反專員等職。卅四年三月廿六日晨，富田德率隊將其　捕，非刑逼供，遍體鱗傷，因狄堅不吐實，於六月四日夜間，將狄緊紥口眼，力挫斃命，盛以草包，運至荒地，宰割屍體。折斷臂腿，蜷埋土穴，幷禁收屍。</p>
<p>倒臥灌水　撞壁燙火</p>
<p>又有曹科者，亦因策反工作，於卅四年四月一日被捕，經富田德非刑逼供，倒臥灌水，騎身　肩，撞壁火燙，墊石懸伴，嗾犬使咬，猶幸嗅而不曲，免致非命，惟骨傷迄今未痊，灼痕依然存在，又史變臣亦於同年四月八日被捕，竹棍鞭背，皮破血流，幷以灌水狗咬等詞相恫嚇，拘禁半月中，僅得拳大飯團二，褐則强喝陰溝臭水，後裝瘋痴，始得脫險。勝利後經狄妻狄方德賢具呈京滬衛戍總司令部，飭由戰俘管理處，將被告解送軍事法庭偵查起訴，經該庭審訊後，以被告所犯罪行，至爲兇暴，於四月十七日判處死刑，頃奉國防部電令核准執行。</p>
<p>遺書三通　汗出如漿</p>
<p>昨晨軍事法庭檢察官符樹德，偕同書記官袁據淸，翻譯官羅滌等，蒞臨上海監獄，於九時五十三分，將該起日獄中提出，富田德着舊黃色軍服，其領章符號等業已　去，身材瘦小自知死期已至，面無人色，經檢察官詢明年籍後，問其有無遺言，則請准寫遺書三封，即以鉛筆作書，內心慌意亂，鉛筆頭屢斷，汗出如漿，寫至第三封時，索取香烟一枝，遺書措詞頗爲荒謬：（一）江灣拘留所隊長以下各位：八月十四日午前我的命運終結了，身後事情拜託丸山，野口，森下諸君照料，敬祝各位健康，祝皇軍再建，萬壽無疆。（二）愛妻：我的命運在今天終結了，我的心靈很安定，相信我的子孫會跟着我的精神更生的，我的靈魂永遠圍繞在母親左右，希望你克守日本婦道，照拂母親，紙短情長，不盡欲言。（三）母親，兒不孝，請原諒我，我今天是以日本帝國軍人的身份處死了，我的事情只有天皇天神知道，請你不要悲傷，保重身體。此紙上尚留一地名：愛知縣知多郡三和村。</p>
<p>砰然一響　頓時畢郃</p>
<p>書畢，檢察官即命行刑，此時富田汗如雨下，由旁立士兵用手巾代爲揩乾，以麻繩將兩手背綁，挾上刑塲。該犯坐於木椅時，以戰慄之聲，呼「天皇萬歲」，由憲兵班長馬玉山舉槍，砰然一響，彈自後腦進，從口腔出，血流如注，頓時畢命，時正上午十時二十分。屍體覆以白布，由日僑互助會代崁松岡性明領去。</p>
<p>富田德執行後，寄押上海監獄被判死刑戰犯尚餘花花太歲平田芝三郞一名，其最後命運恐亦不遠矣。</p>
<p>執行前提出詢問（本報攝）</p>

<h3>中國農民之友　基督敎兄弟團　在杭舉行第二次年會</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員傭裕生杭州十三日訊〕聯總在　農業技術專家三十八人，於八月十二日起在杭州舉行會議，這三十八位農業技術專家，都是參加美團基督敎兄弟會的。他們不要　總與行總的報酬，純粹義務的爲中國廣大的農村服務，而且他們還從美國捐輸曳引機，乳牛，肥田粉，種子與殺虫藥。他們眞正的深入農村，分佈在中國的東北，河南，湖北，江蘇，浙江等省工作。　他們雖然是農業技術專家，但並不衣冠楚楚，道貌岸然，在舉行會議的時節，還是　着汗衫，或是沒有繫領帶的櫬衫，有的還是赤着脚，短褲。</p>
<p>滿腮鬍子也沒功能夫剃</p>
<p>年齡二三十歲，而　　倒有于右老那樣的長了。記者曾經對他們這樣不事修飾發生了興趣，他們幾乎異口同聲的說：「我們來自田間，我們整天工作，根本不必整儀態，也沒有功能夫來修整，正同中國的農民一樣」。</p>
<p>在會塲上，只有兄弟服務團執行秘書兼本次年會主席蘇倫白Sullienbazger抽捲烟的，其他的農業專家沒有一個抽烟的。十二日的開幕式，只有行總浙分署　長孫曉樓和視察室主任張中楹是打領帶而衣履整潔的，因此惹起他們的傻笑，孫張二氏有點窘意。</p>
<p>他們在中國曾經集會過一次，是去年一月在漢口舉行，這已經是第二次了，這種集會名之謂年會，檢討在中國服務的成績與今後如何開展工作？</p>
<p>行總浙江分署署長孫曉樓說：「中國的大多數人民是可愛的，願意他們多多的接近農民，這才可以尋求眞正的民意所在」。孫中楹說：「中國離開農業現代化的距離太遠了，要用科學的方法來改進農利的生產技術。」聯總</p>
<p>駐杭農業專家茅根氏</p>
<p>Morgan博士說：「我們多謝兄弟會的帮助，但是我們更切望他們能　進一步援助我們工作」。聯總山國辦事處農業復興委員會主席葛林Green說：「去年八月我到河南去，正是大水災以後，數十萬畝的荒地，居民都紛紛逃避，渺無人烟，眞是赤地千里，今年七月，我又到河南去，看見土地都墾了，而且下了種子，這荒蕪了的土地已變成了耕種的熟地，這原來都是百千農民，自己胼手胝足來做成的，由此，可見中國農民力量的偉大，意志的堅强。我們技術人員在荒地的時候，即使有洩引機，恐怕也要望地興嘆，而中國農民能夠不畏艱難，不怕辛苦，這實在是我們英美國人民應該佩服的，如果在三年之內，給以機器，則中國的人民可以墾殖全世界的土地」。他認爲今天中國農村制度不需要革命，而是需要技術的改進。他希望兄弟會諸君努力協助中國農業技術達於現代化。</p>
<p>兄弟會諸農業技術專家，他們正埋頭研究協助</p>
<p>中國農業技術現代化</p>
<p>聽說他們這一次年會的議題爲第一步使中國農村能普遍使用　引機，第二步使農村不必用人力來抽水，而改用機器抽水的方法來灌溉田畝。第三步是使中國能製造肥田粉與使種子保藏得很好。至於改良農村的農艮則有聯總與當地官民合辦的農具公司製造應用。兄弟會諸君在行總結束後，則仍留中國若干時期帮助農業掖術的改進。</p>
<p>他們多半都是美國專研農業的專家，而這些專家並沒有做起官來，也沒有坐在辦公室專劃「行」辦公。更沒有終天出席鷄尾酒會與感大的宴會，更沒有在公開的案會上衣冠楚楚地發表動人的演講，他們也却是胼手胝足的與農民共同工作，他們才可以說是眞正的專家。希望我們中國研究農業的人們趕快深入農村去，把美國的兄弟會作爲一個良好的榜樣！</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕在　總中志願工作之「兄弟服務團」，十二杭州開會，聯總中國分署署長克利扶蘭特去電　揚該團之工作精神及其實際成就。團員來自十二個省份，使用牲畜三五九〇頭，曳引機一一三六座，在一年之中，耕種荒地四十萬畝，並訓練能使用新式耕具之農民達一千人。</p>
<h3>青島張凌雲被捕後　警局發表油印聲明　全市新聞同業在繼續交涉中</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島十日訊〕本市新生社社長張凌雲為市當局逮捕消息，已刋本報。張被便衣警察四人，在六月一日上午一時逮走，不出示身份證書及郃令，謂「你不用管」，用手槍押上大卡車，其妻出而阻止，亦遭手槍威脅，形同綁票，此事已激動全體新聞界公憤。截至昨晚為止，已有四日，警局方面突然發一油印聲明，文曰：「本市上海路二號新生社社長張凌雲於廿七年曾任共匪五支隊（林瑞武部）政治指共匪五支隊（林瑞武部）政治指導員，時化名丁光，廿八年投偽任　縣新民會宣撫班班長及偽新民報特約通訊記者，經本市魯東抗戰同志聯誼會及灘縣縣政府先後呈擦證實，本局奉上峯密令，執行查緝，遵於本月六日晨一時將該張凌雲連捕到案，已於本日（九日）晚移送法院依法審訊矣。」今晚十時，又發一油印聲明補遺，其原文云：「查特種刑事案件，複雜錯綜，偵察需時，法有明文規定，自不能與普通案件同受廿四小時之拘束。張案發生後，外間不明眞相，甚至揑造黑白，云本局施以體罰者，業由張君自行否認，可謂不攻自破。總之、本局行事，一秉大公，惟法是從。」</p>
<p>報界方面對於此聲明，多所懷疑：廿七年國共合作抗日，何以今日便爲罪狀，何况張並未加入共匪？至於漢奸案件，應由法院辦理，且按特種刑事訴訟條例中，並無「不受廿四小時拘束」一條。當晚經向法院查詢，張案並未移解法院，而在張被押四日內，根本未予訊問。凡此數點，報界現均表示不滿。尤其是軍民日報及靑報，抗議得最厲害。</p>
<p>現全市各報對此案一致表示，如交涉無效，不惜以全市報界罷業來對手付。</p>
<p>八日警局會將張武裝押送警備司令部，警備部亦曾接獲此項密告，業巳調查，各節全屬子虛，不予受理。警局至此遂成騎虎難下之勢。迄發稿時止，張仍被押警局。</p>

<p>〔本報紹興十二日訊〕浙省水利局孫局長，為督促各工程及早完成起見，特於本月十二日來紹，轉往曹娥工程處，并囑加緊趕工，一面派　壽傑沈工程師，分赴寗波東錢湖，寗波車　港等搶修工程處分頭督導。</p>

<h3>七十四師李參謀長　談部屬詐降的故事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十一日訊〕在　縣訪邱師長之後，他又介紹參謀長李仁俊將軍和記者見面。李將軍原是七十四師的老幹部，身材不高，他是一個沉靜的暮僚人員，他和記者略事寒暄後，懷着一股愉快的心情告訴記者說：「滕縣一役，孟良崮被俘的七十四師官兵</p>
<p>連人帶槍，來歸本師者已上千人。」這一個絕好的消息，眞是記者意外的收穫。記者追問着：「他們是怎樣行動的？」李參謀長說：「據來歸的一個士兵告訴我，他們是在孟良崮的一個死角地帶被共匪集體俘虜的，在當時的情形下，不降即死，爲了保存七十四師的元氣，一個邇長向我們暗暗的通聲氣，權且詐「降」，再說，被俘以後，原先他極監視我們的，後來由於我們的巧言令色，把匪軍　了，仍發還我們的槍彈，令我們隨着匪軍「作戰」，其實我們自己刻刻的暗地保持聯合着，他幾次把我們迫上最前綫，我們豈忍自己打自己人？當着匪軍離開我們的時候，我們當然是朝向天空射擊，可是有時不能這樣辦，這一次滕縣大戰，我們這道共匪的主力，大部調來這裏增防，我們爲着替七十四師先烈復仇，爲着戡平匪亂，我們再不能忍受下去，在一個黑暗之夜，機槍掉過頭來，槍口轉向匪營，我們有計劃的殺賊，我們有計劃的撤退，這這樣混殺了五個鐘頭，等到匪軍知道尾追，我們已是退入安全地帶，與國軍取得聯絡了。這個神聖的詐「降」，能收到這樣戰略的效果，那是不可多得的。（特約記者丁匡華）</p>

<h3>本市卅七年度敎育經費　預計約需三千億　市敎育局正在編造預算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會開會在即，市府各局處巳在編製三十七年度預算。近數月來物價高漲數倍，而未來情形又雜逆料，故編製預算頗感困難，一般均較本年度增加數借，三十七年度敎育經費預算約達三千億元，其中以國民敎育經費所佔最多。連日市敎育局各處正在趕編是項預算，將於下週由局彙報市府。</p>

<h3>爭取國際市塲推動對外貿易　中信收購桐油猪鬃　商人分別提出意見希望當局改進</h3>
<p>中央信託局代理政府收購出口物資，開始以來，推行極爲順利，截至目前止，桐油方面共達五千噸，包括在本市收購者二千噸，在長沙漢口重慶等地收購者約二千噸。又在五千噸以內，中植油廠獨佔一，九七〇噸，包括本市八七〇噸，漢口四五〇噸，重慶一〇〇噸，梧州二五〇噸，廣州二〇〇噸。中信局爲推行政府津貼制度，將收購之貨，交於商人出國運銷。幷爲爭取歐洲市塲計，已向英國及歐洲大陸各地，以桶業每噸計一七七英鎊價格售出一千噸。至美國市塲，以價格關係，暫存觀望。惟據桐油廠商意見，（一）該局目前收購價格，每市擔六十三萬元，似嫌過低。脫手後，自產地無法補進。因商人尚須付拆息匯水，運繳漏耗等費，合理價格，每擔須在七十萬元以上。（二）全部付款日期，非一星期不可，亦嫌太慢，時間爲商人重大成本，希望該局酌量縮短。（三）已收購貨品，輸出迂緩之原因，則爲價格略高，推動困難。倘若採取適合市價，加以調整，國外實銷，更可振興云。　至於猪鬃收購辦法，又有變更。據悉：過去係向猪鬃商收進後，再由出口商代爲外銷，目前則改爲出口商外銷以後，再行收購。猪鬃業方面，爲擁護政府政策，尚無異議。惟（一）百分之二手續費，殊覺過低。因出口商在國外市塲脫手時，即應付百分之二手續費，本身電報。紙張。工繳等項開支，反而無着，特請求增加手續費爲百分之四，俾不致遭受虧累。。國外價格，時有變動，中信局所訂之外銷價格，亦須經過會議決定，往往不能應付國外市塲之演變，萬一國外市塲有跌價之趨勢，經過會議以後，則無法成交，應請採機動方式，以免貽誤時機。（三）收購價款，往返週折，十日以後，始能領用，亦應改善。（四）收購爲全國性政策，中信局單獨辦理此一繁重之任務，實有困離，應指定其他機構，按照歸定辦法，同時辦理。以上各點，猪鬃業認爲有關國際貿易之關係絕大，希望政府予以攷慮。</p>
<h3>要求減低人絲配價　絲織業代表昨晉京　中信局昨配貨仍無人申請</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區絲織工榮同業公會代表蔡昕濤•劉慶一等十六人，爲請求核减人造絲配價，及改進配售辦法計，已於昨日分兩批乘車晉京。此行將分別向行政院·社會部·經濟部等機關請願云。</p>
<p>又訊：據蔡劉二氏昨日臨行前語稱；經吳市長出面調停後，中信局已允减爲新配價八折，現正向行政院請示，惟吳市長提議以黑市七，配價五之比例配絲，即以新配價七折配售。至渠等晋京請願使命，係請當局改善配絲辦法及組設配絲委員會等四項要求</p>
<p>又訊；據悉，中央信託局代售會昨第十九次配售織帶業人絲，該業仍未有前往申購者，聞該會連同本次已有二週未經配出人絲云。</p>
<p>人絲價漲</p>
<p>又訊：人造絲配售價　局仍未打開，故昨市執貨者乘機又告扳抬，比上日高漲達一百萬元强，一二〇號高山有光上午先喊五百二十萬元出，五百萬元進，中午升至五百四十萬元賣出價，下午續升，最後喊六百萬元，不過成交甚稀。</p>
<p>廠經稍升</p>
<p>昨高勻度五擔頭廠經仍乏成交，中級另擔及高另擔略有做開，中級貨價做二千六百五十萬至七百五十萬元，高另擔價做二千七百五十萬至八百五十萬元，干經去胃頗呆，喊價未更。</p>
<p>綢貨堅昂</p>
<p>昨因綢廠或有被迫停工之可能，人心振奮，華强被面開市一千〇十一萬元，九點鐘時，十五萬元即期成交，隔日期二十萬元，最高即期到廿一萬元，收市即期價爲十九萬元，隔日期廿二萬元。大誠報面最後價爲三十二萬元，隔日期三十五萬元，均比上日大十三四萬元。格子璧縐三萬三千八百元，華錦縐去胃仍好，高檔貨二萬三千元有成交，民生臘綠花綈，客帮需求甚殷，昨市做開二萬五千元。</p>
<h3>浙省棉蔴生產　本年可望豐收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經氏，近自杭州一帶視察歸來，據談：本年浙江方面（包括杭州蕭山海寗一帶，）棉蔴兩項產量，可望豐收。原棉方面，迎新老棉種在內，估計可產四十萬担，內有本年開始推廣之德氏改良棉種一萬担。黃蔴產量去年僅十五萬担，本年經一再改良，添植印度及台灣蔴種，產量可望增加至三十萬担，明年計劃擬增產至六十萬担。如預期目標達到，則國內黃蔴已可達自給自足之狀態。</p>
<p>又訊：美國輸船公司之僑細批成但奇（譯音）號，中美澳林其運來大批棉花，計五千零七十四噸，合計二萬餘件。輪於昨日到滬。聞尚有大量棉花，日內繼續到埠。</p>
<h3>食米上落微細</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧六千六百餘石，市勢兎起鵑落，起伏狹隘，粳米秈米均見回升三五千元，惟午時形趨懈淡，白一元陰元高貨上漲萬元，中下平平。</p>
<p>麵粉漲跌互有，洋粉消化仍活，步砌三五千元。廠粉平站，統粉亦無呼吸。雜牌粉回疲千元，麩皮供求兩稀。豆餅臺灣汕頭猛吸之下，頓形上揚，回高三四千元。</p>
<p>黃豆客帮動辦，本街隨之收購，陳豆轉升三五千至萬元。新豆猛漲萬餘元，菉豆胃呆乏神，勢離生色。赤豆平定，苞米新貨漸湧，去化平平，續挫三五千元。蠶豆暫少波動，芝蔴不疲之格，生仁猛跌之後，華南路有問津，本街零化稍動，漸趨甦象回漲萬元。</p>
<p>油市連疲之後，店方納胃轉殷，生豆油俱升二三萬元，淸油菜油亦昻一二萬元，蔴油加萬元。　又訊、保和洋行經理之恩派亞蒙頓（譯音）號，昨由曼谷運來　米四千噸，係聯總運來。</p>
<h3>統債略堅　外股上漲</h3>
<p>公債昨以當局對外債積極設法淸理及償還等訊，買方頗見興趣，統丙晨開一三〇〇〇元，漲到一三七〇〇元，最後在一三三〇〇元左右徘徊。五五二室三六〇室有供，寳隆五〇三室五五五室有買，成交約七百萬左右。結果較前收計甲乙升一千元，丙丁各漲一千四，統戊好起一千五。</p>
<p>外股昨得報載張院長發表有利於外商在華投資之談論所激動，更得種種物價之剌激，匯水並巳自八四五〇〇元，業廣自三三五〇〇元起，均呈爭買，咸以高價結束。小股不甚俏利，所升有限，中企猛購業廣數達萬股，銀錢業及證劵帮均進，廣帮及洋行帮則出。結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐怡俾鎭業各漲一成强，紙業祥泰升半成，航業微升電話尚平。</p>
<h3>華股買氣重振　多數高價結束</h3>
<p>華股昨盤旋而漲，外股之助力，引起大量買氣，於是空頭方面被迫抵補，大戶多頭欲出先拉，近午漲風俏利，混亂中且將商務中絲拉上至漲停限度，各股遂紛紛重振。除內衣外，咸告俏利，以高價結束。</p>
<p>晨開見昂，開後遞永紗一一七號二二四號二二三號均進，二一八號一三三號二〇七號一七二號一六三號一一二號二二五號一三〇號並進現永紗，而漲到二一〇元及二一五元。二三二號八四號七六號一三七號供給現永紗，一四號九七號亦賣遞永紗，退至二一〇元光景。二〇七號一六三號一五八號來進現永紗，二一八號三二號一一六號二二四號二二三號八九號一一二號二一九號補進遞永紗，回好到二二一元。</p>
<p>十一時後，四五號二三六號趁高脫手，七六號一八三號尚進、，形勢徘徊者較久。十一時半，八五號四五號　進，一六二號來購現永紗，近午曾漲到二二四元。二二六號賣出現永紗，二二三號二二〇號亦有了結，曾迫低至二一八元。終以大戶欲出先拉，二〇七號四五號二二四號等買　尚濃，商務中絲在混亂中漲達限度，人心仍俏，次熱各股紛紛漲高，永紗亦以二二〇元及二二二元結束。</p>
<p>收後喊價稍昂，結果較前收即交股計永紗美亞升一成，新光景福中法新華各漲半成，華豐漲起一成强，勤興永公微升，內衣微挫，　安尚平，水泥新亞火柴大通統益微升，榮　漲半成，中紡景綸各漲一成左右。中絲商務漲達限度。遞交股計華豐漲成半，永紗美亞新光升一成左右，景福好起半成强，塲外各老股略形回好。</p>

<p>又聞此次收購新茶，以茶貸辦法，原係四聯總處規定，經由中農行之手貸出，故決請四聯與中農行參加處理新茶之收購事宜，俾茶貸與收購手續，能獲取聯繫</p>
<p>茶市平定</p>
<p>最近以來，茶市內銷終趨動而乏整之勢，過程並不活潑，但人心仍亟穩定。而價格方面，因貨品比前參差不一，遂各有變遷，實則猶呈膠着狀態。至於洋莊茶市，沉靜多日之局面，仍未打破。良以一月前，法商永興洋行與非洲摩洛哥談妥之九百噸珍眉，刻下本市承接之出口商，鑒於船期業已屆臨，乃均忙於裝運，其他不及兼顧。茲悉：法商永興洋行對於珍眉等綠茶，續擬向彼地推銷，聞在日內即將拍電海外兜攬云。</p>
<h3>紡綢小組會決定　調整廿支紗議價　每件為九百七十萬元</h3>

<p>紗價續挺</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以連日價跌已鉅，客帮逢低頗有進取，而本街亦有動辦，塲中利買傳說紛紜，市勢續趨品騰。</p>
<p>迨至最後，四二支藍鳳比上日繼漲七十六萬，爲一千六百八十萬元。二十支特雙馬昂至一千一百五十萬元，輕雙馬亦高至一千零二十萬元，均漲五十萬元。十六支粗紗光明亦升五十五萬，爲九百十萬元，海龍軋升五十萬，爲八百四十萬元。其他各支粗細紗，一致續挺一二十萬至四五十萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布略升</p>
<p>昨日棉布市況，初開散戶依然供售，十二鎊龍頭細布一度低見三十九萬五千元，旋因大戶逢小收吸，各方亦出手動辦，交易約百件左右。又傳港幣貶値，游資有轉滬市活動可能，致塲內買氣更形濃厚，籌碼不充，龍頭細布由低價一略上升至四十二萬四千元時，有獲利吐售稍回，至最後爲四十一萬元，比上日續漲五千元。詎收市後，塲外價高至四十一萬五千元有受主。</p>
<p>五福彩球藍鷄陽鶴振中等各擋細布，亦均步升二千至五千元。其餘白坯漂布及元布細斜士林布繁銷者，上升三五千至二萬元左右，直貢府綢元斜藍布粗布市呈盤旋。</p>

<h3>棉市續穩</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况轉挺，趨勢穩定，買方因棉紗續好，納胃轉濃，本街紗廠頗有進意，惟因時屆新棉登塲不遠，新貨看湧，故開價不肯提高，交易又多擱淺，成交比上日稍差。各檔做開送廠價：　寳二〇五萬，沙市一九八萬，漢口細絨一九四萬，棧交價靈寳二〇〇萬，二〇二萬，周浦籽花二九萬。</p>

<h3>讀「新世界的哲學」</h3>
<p>— 孟琨</p>
<p>章新一著　開明書店出版</p>
<p>這一册最近出版討論哲學問題的書，用最通俗的手法敍述，不僅論及傳統上被認爲該屬于哲學領域的一些課題，同時又牽連到其餘很多社會的，自然的，人生的，生活的，以及宇宙的，國際的各部分。如書名所示，這是一册研究「新世界」的哲學的書，所以作者由他的觀點，把哲學開拓爲一無所不涵的綱領，於是再剖柝着每一「新世界」的法則和系統。</p>
<p>生活在我們這一時代，人對於智識的需要較以往任何一歷史片段爲迫切。哲學，原是某少數專門人材去鑽習的，到了今日，却被一般人所關心。我們的出版界，以前也刋行過不少哲學的專書，不過都是學院式的經典，給學人們去找覓眞理，不用於帮助一般民衆去瞭解這世界的眞相。這册書，提供了好些常識似地的哲學智識，那些智識，對於作爲一新世界公民的人，是實用而不可缺的。</p>
<p>這書或可設是一册實用的哲學，然而與世俗之所謂人生哲學又有距離。牠的範圍更廣泛，觸及每一箇世紀所存在的抽象問題。與其說這書是一本介紹哲學常識的，那還不如說牠是介紹時代常識的爲佳。牠給讀者以一明晣的世界觀，社會觀。從這一册書的瀏覽裏，我們可看到我們人類如何地生活在此一時空裏，以及如何生活下去。瞭解了時代是什麼，我們的時代有那些大問題，於是我們懂得個人應採取怎樣的一個人生準繩，走向未來，建立新文化，創造新文明。</p>
<p>全篇約十五萬字，分二編。第一編「倫理系統」，專講一些人生的基本觀念和基本原則；第二編「演譯及問題」是第一編的延展，從抽象而具體，討論各個實際錯綜着的問題。</p>
<p>第一編的第一章，提出了我們這時代的基本責任，是說如何去免除人類的不幸以及進一步培殖出幸福的花菓。作者將二次世界大戰的痛苦回憶作爲警惕，而喊出「改造思想」的口號，這雖然有些說敎氣味，但配合了作者的功利主義，和末段的一些對社會重建的憧憬，可看出作者是一熱誠的人道崇敬者，而不是玄想人物。基於此一前提，蔓展着作者的思緒，從揭發了這世界亂的根源後，接着講「宇宙與事件」，「類與因果」，「目的與手段」，「這德」等問題。此後是四章並排着的，先論們人的好壞，人生的價値，快樂及幸福等；再論公衆的好壞，因而對照出人和社會的輕重及關係；再論對與錯的問題，什麼是眞理，什麼是客觀的絕對是非；末論善與惡，批評一個人的行爲及智識；這一些討論，都歸結到道德的淵泉，而綜合了中西的各家倫理學說。</p>
<p>接着的一編便根據上述的理論來討論一些「最大最根本」的實際問題。首先是人生觀，「人生於世，是要大家通力合作，把我們的宇宙，變成一個最好的宇宙」；職業觀，「任何職業，都是盡忠於自己在宇宙中的職守」；其他是說本之時代的精神在於從追求少數人的福利，進而爲追求多數人的福利。最後抽出這世界的七大問題：第一國家觀，作者推崇泛愛，希望大同，歌頌正義外交，夢視殖民地制度。第二經濟觀，論物質享受和享受的分配，却也論及人口問題。第三論民主，第四論道德問題。第五論宗敎，第六論哲學，第七論科學。他都很理性地，自由地把他對新世界的信仰充分地流露。</p>
<p>綜觀這一册雷，以形式論，是很够通俗的，以內容論，很够實用。作者普採各學者已有的學說，但並不枯燥，術語採用得不多，解釋透闢，文句平易，證例叢出，同時採用新的組織，將原有的哲學上人生諸問題，雜着新的世界各動態，極適當地相錯着，不見彌縫。再則，作者將每一切合於現人類日常生活的諸問題，做他的對象，每一問題，都與我們生存在這世界上有密接的關係，我們接受了，我們便多少看淸了所身處的時空。</p>
<h3>小麪人求仙記</h3>
<p>— 頡頏</p>
<p>（希望社出版）</p>
<p>「小麵人求仙記」，單純的就書的本身來看，是一本不壞的　。如果用作者的野心，或作者自己所希冀的目的來看，却並不是本最好的書。作者卷頭就說，以這本書給「遠離了我的我底小女兒和一切遠離了父母的孩子們」。而書中所叙說的即是小麵人爲了要眞正成爲一個人，因引起了求仙途中的種種困難。所以本書的續者當不是在象牙塔裏鬧，因多吃了牛乳而消化不良的少爺小姐，而應是那些要遭受「遠離父母」的惡運的孩子。然而，在本書中有許多是這些孩子所不能了解的形象和字眼，這也許是應該指摘的。像：「好像有一個人在輕輕的拉着懷娥鈴」，「跨着卓別麟式的步子」，「By-ByBy-By」，和一哈　」。那些「遠離了父母的孩子們」，可會知道「懷娥鈴」，「卓別麟」，「By-By」，和「哈　」爲何物？這些地方是應代以較通俗的形象字眼的。又如：「高興得好像考得一百分」這個「好像」像得非常不妥，因爲我們不再需要養成孩子們視分數若命的觀念了。</p>
<p>此外，作者有一點地方是疎忽了的。小麵人所遭逢的四次危險，除對狐狸外都沒有詳細的性格描寫。不過其中作者對兎子的描述有很成功的獨創性：兎子夢見獅大王對他說，「你有兩隻長耳朶，應該什麼都聽得着……搬點兒是非不要緊」。是不同於狐狸，狗，猶的抄襲舊童的。獨創，尤其在兒童讀物稀少的中國是重要的。</p>
<p>本書好的地方，當有以下幾點：</p>
<p>第一是打譬喻的技巧方面。像狗對小麵人說：</p>
<p>「歡迎你走進我的大門</p>
<p>（牠指指牠的嘴），</p>
<p>到我家屋裏歇歇腿，</p>
<p>（牠拍拍牠的肚子）。」</p>
<p>用這個形式是較明朗而易爲小讀者所接受的。</p>
<p>第二是對於小麵人的天眞，不用一個形容詞，而很成功的從對話中表現出來。像小麵人說：</p>
<p>「幹嗎你流着口水盯牢我？書不害羞呵！」「唔，唔，唔，我就要哭起來了！」</p>
<p>第三，這本童話詩的香節已達上乘，諧和而自然。</p>
<p>總之，這本書雖巧拙互見，但在現在的中國總還不失其爲一本可以一讀的兒童讀物。</p>
<h3>當代中國名人辭典</h3>
<p>— 宗浩</p>
<p>任嘉堯編　東方書店出版</p>
<p>近年來，國內人事情形的變幻，繁多而複雜，往往使人們摸不淸癥結所在。尤其是在抗戰八年和勝利復二年，這十年的過程中，大局動蕩不定，人事變動，千變萬化，如果要明瞭當前的時事，那就非從這些林林總總的新聞人物入手不可。</p>
<p>在國內可憐的出版界中，近十年來，似乎還沒有人着手編輯過一本當代中國名人辭典這類的書。對於報紙讀者，要「知人論事」，從當事人物的思想背景來探索事實的因果發展，因爲缺少這類辭書，每每感到非常困難，對求知慾旺盛的育年，是異常苦痛的。</p>
<p>現在，任嘉堯編的「當代中國名人辭典」，已出版了，雖不能說包羅萬象，把全國的要人的生平都詳細敍述在內，可是它却具備着一個顯明簡要的輪廓，讓讀者對於國內政軍，實業，學術各方面的人物，都有一個概括的認識。讓人家來知道每一時人的出生年份，籍貫，別號，出身，經歷，著作，現任職務等一些主要事項。某排列次序，則以姓名筆劃多寡爲先後，檢查起來，相當方便。</p>
<p>就全書看來，它最後的訂正，該是政府改組的那階段，因此民靑兩黨的中堅份子，也有若千補入。本書所載名人，約一千五六百人，在量方面說，確是不够完備和翔實，又因爲缺乏照片，閱讀起來，不够醒目。可是，如果我們當它做讀報的參考，以此爲基礎來認識新聞，來「知人論事」，仍不失爲一本相當有價値有內容的參考書。</p>
<h3>生物進化淺說</h3>
<p>— 東淵</p>
<p>（周建人著，生活版，定價，七千元）</p>
<p>生物是在進化着的，根據開落格（V.Kellogg）說明「進化」的意義，是：</p>
<p>「進化的意思是連續，是轉變，從舊的發生出新的；是改變，繼續運動，與逐漸發展。它的意思是系統相關，血統相速，生物的無所不包之一個系統。它的意思是一切生物的基本統一，然而各種類及各個體的外貌及態度却有變異的。進化是一條連續的生命流，在不同的部分，表現不同，但實際並不斷落的。」</p>
<p>誠然的，「進化是一條連續的生命流，」人類在這條條路綫上，展開了前進激烈的鬥爭！</p>
<p>對於「進化學說」這一方面的著作，近年來已有數種譯本，但因文字的艱澀，令一般人不易去讀它，例如達爾文的「種的起源」等。因而，也就有許多知識份子，雖知道「進化」兩字，而莫明「進化」的眞實含義爲何？</p>
<p>局建人先生的這本近著——「生物進化淺說」，正彌補了上述缺憾，這是一册原著，文筆上沒有譯文的那種枯燥艱澀的意味，而是能合乎一般讀者來讀它的。</p>
<p>這一本書，作者所用的筆調比他其他著譯，顯為通俗簡明，因為它底對象是一般的青年——給靑年以自修用的，在內容方面，是對生物進化學說，說了一個概要。</p>
<p>第一，他就說明了甚麼叫做「進化」？把「進化」的意義說得很淸楚，各派不同的譯「進化」的譯法，也作客觀的說明。</p>
<p>接着，他論述了生物界的豐富，生物界裏的聯系，生物的發展，及其變化與變化的「原因」。這些一方面，所述簡明精確，讀了對生物方面的進化轉變，定能有一個槪要的了解。</p>
<p>後面，作者又說出本能與它的由來，人類的由來，以及言語與文字，由古迄令，作者都以簡明的筆調，很淸楚地講出來。</p>
<p>讀完了這些文章之後，對生物進化的各項意義都能憧憬，尤其是靑年，可以平添不少必要的知識。</p>
<p>這一本著作，在一般上講，它是够得上水準的，尤其是這一類書籍，出版界中是很難找到的。也是對出版界的一個貢獻。</p>
<h3>新藝術論</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>蔡儀著　商務印書館印行</p>
<p>這一類的書，是解決「什麼是藝術」一個問題的書，道本「新藝術諭」，自亦不能例外。</p>
<p>全書共分八章，計一九二頁，是三十二開本。三十二年七月重慶初版，翌年十二月再版，三十五年上海初版，最近又把它收入於「中學生文庫」之中。</p>
<p>在第一章「序說」裏，說明藝術與現實及枓學的關係，從認識上區別藝術與科學的不同，藝術的認識是感性的，科學的認識是智性的，前者是形象的，後者是論理的。著者又確定：藝術是現實認識的表現，而這種表現，又需要熟練的技術，但，不是反復同一或類似的行爲所習得的技術，却需要以能够表現現實的本質，作典型的形象的認識為前提的。</p>
<p>認識是藝術創作的開端，完成即是表現。第二，第三兩章就對這方面予以詳細的考察。苜先從哲學的兩大分野——唯心論和唯物論——來說明什麼才是認識。作者肯定地說：「感覺是認識的基礎，而現實的外物又是感覺的源泉，而且沒有現實的外物，根本便沒有意識，一切認識都是現實的反映。」（二九頁）而藝術則是一種認識的表現，他反對靈感論天才論的說法，斷定：「藝術不是潛意識的發露，也不是幻想的成果，即是說不是超乎現實的，不是和現實隔絕的，而是客觀現實的反映，即作者對於客觀現實的一種認識。」（三二頁）認識的特質是怎樣的？就是主要地通過智性再歸於感性以反映客觀現實的一般於個別之中。同時，實蹺是作者對於客觀現實的認識的契機，又須能動地意識的認識。藝術的認識的內容，是反映客觀現實的一般於個別之中的形象，就是藝術的典型的創造。</p>
<p>所謂表現，是認識的幕寫，認識也可以說是表現的根源。但就藝術的表現與宣傳的關係上考察，在作者與作品方面說：是自我的認識的表現，造自我的完成。在社會方面說：是對他人的傳達；前者是藝術的藝術性，後者是藝術的宣傳性，兩者却必須以藝術性爲基美而統一在完成了的藝術裏頭。藝術性愈高，宣傳性愈大，藝術性愈低，宜傳性愈小，所以藝術性是第一義。</p>
<p>藝術的表現需要技巧，但，技巧是不能脫離其他的藝術創作的條件而獨立存在的。技巧的主要條件有三：一，對於表現的對象的構成規律的熟悉；二，對於對象所受的主觀精神的影響的熱悉；三，對於表現的工具的特殊性能的熟悉。這三者的一致的關聯，便是藝術表現的至上的方法。</p>
<p>第四章說明藝術的內容和形式。著者認定，藝術的「認識是內容，表現是他的形式，內容決定形式，但形式對於藝術也是本質的，能動的要素，它有它的獨自性，能反作用於內容進一步要求內容和形式的統一。」</p>
<p>藝術的主觀性的基礎就是個性，站在赴會的觀點看，便是意識的階層性；客觀性，就是由於通過作者的意識而反映的客觀現實的本質或眞理，也就是藝術內容的核心，於是，客觀的現實是有歷史性，而反映它的藝術便有時代性的，要求藝術的時代性，便表現了它的永久性，要追求久性，那非把握時代性不可。</p>
<p>藝術是現實認識的表現，表現的是什麼？它即是在相關諸屬性——藝術的內容，形式，主觀性，客觀性，個性，階層性，時代性，永久性——之前提下表現典型，而表現即是描寫，本書的第五章第六章便考察了這兩個方面。</p>
<p>典型，是在個別裏具現着一般的藝術的形象，也是藝術的核心，於是藝術的創作便是典型的創造。要成藝術的典型，必須要有現實的典型，但，藝術的典型却不是現實，或典型的現實之再現，而是它的典型性的擴大和加深。達到典型性格的創造與典型情勢的把握。典型的正的與負的多面性不一定破壞典型性，反而可以加强典型性。</p>
<p>典型的描寫應該主要地訴之於感性的，這是具體的表現，而智性的便是抽象的表現，然而過於具體便會陷於瑣碎或不得要領。再有過重借外物形象而表現主　精神，或是以發揮工具的特殊性爲藝術創作的要訣，這種基無中心，孤立技巧，是離心的描寫，著者斷定它不是藝術的主要表現方法的描寫，應該反過來以求心的描寫是最合理的，也是創造典型的描寫。</p>
<p>第七章「現實主義」。可以說是當前藝術創作的路　的考察，著者首先說明：現想主義的藝術，是客觀現實以外的藝術美的創造，基於唯心論的哲學，現實主羣的藝術，以客觀現實爲內容，形式也是由內容決定的，是基於唯物論的哲學。其次更以歷史發展的立塲考察現實主義發展的四個階段，並特別指出了新現實主義與舊現實主義的根本的不同，更指出了它的創作方法與世界觀。這兩種東西，「是不可分離的，却不是同一的；是有區別的，却不是矛盾的。正確的世界觀演樣於藝術領域可以成爲正確的指導藝術創作的藝術思想，而正確的創作方法也可以帮助藝術家的正確的世界觀的形成，發展。」（一七二頁）</p>
<p>發後，著者以新現實主義的觀點，來考察「藝術的美與藝術的評價」這種美學上的問題。他斷定：藝術的眞與藝術的美是相關連的，是依存於藝術的典型的。復指出：「　是具體的描寫，愈是求心的描寫，所描寫的愈是有客觀現實根據的典型，愈是高級的典型，這作品的藝術性便愈高，同時它的宣傳性也愈大，也就是愈具有藝術的眞，愈具有藝術的美，愈具有藝術價値的作品。」（一九二頁）</p>

<h3>Economic Reform Implementation Measures: Group Discussions to be Completed Within a Deadline; Expanded Symposium on Property Donations Held</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The National Economic Commission held its eleventh meeting on the afternoon of the 14th. The Secretariat reported detailed measures for the upcoming expanded symposium to discuss the levy of property donations. Regarding personnel selection, in addition to members of the Economic Commission, it was decided to invite the Presidium of the参政会(Participating Political Council), resident members of the 参政会, chairmen of the five committees of the 立法院 (Legislative Yuan), members of the 立法院's Finance and Economic Committees, and the speakers of the 参议会 (Council) of both 京 (Nanjing) and 沪 (Shanghai). The opinions of speakers from other regions will be solicited in writing. The date of the symposium will be jointly determined by Concurrent Chairman Zhang, Vice President Wu of the 立法院, Vice President Wang of the 政院 (Executive Yuan), and Secretary-General Shao of the 参政会. The discussion outline will be based on the original draft of the property donation levy plan, focusing on discussing the name, target of levy, starting point, and method of levy separately. Issues such as how to handle non-compliance, whether to levy on overseas Chinese, and how to deal with foreign businesses in China will also be discussed. Another report from the Secretariat concerned the implementation measures for the economic reform plan. For group discussions, it was decided to focus on each industry in the plan, dividing into twelve small groups: economy, finance, transportation, water conservancy, agriculture and forestry, industry, foreign trade, mining, land administration, food, labor-management issues, and price issues. Each group will designate one or two people to convene, with the relevant minister serving as the leader. Members will be recruited by the group conveners from within and outside the commission, inviting scholars and experts to participate, with a deadline of two weeks for completion. In addition to hearing and passing the above two reports, the meeting also discussed two important proposals. One was the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises. The principle was decided that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises should be 30% higher than that of other civil servants, and if there is a surplus, a bonus of three months' salary should be awarded at the end of the year. The details of this plan are still under discussion, and it was decided to form another small group of seven committee members – Weng Wenhao, Chen Qitian, Yu Dawei, Gu Zhenggang, Wu Yunfu, Pan Xulun, and Liu Zhendong – to review it first. The other was the "Measures for Foreign Businesses Requesting to Establish Factories in China" proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The meeting decided that, since the attitude adopted by our country towards foreign affairs and President Zhang's statement today have already made clear, there is no need for further discussion, and it was resolved to send it to the 政院.</p>
<h3>Draft Property Donation Plan Completed; To Be Submitted to Three Institutions, Including the Legislative Yuan, for Review and Approval; Levy Target Primarily Large Households</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Regarding the issue of property donation levy, the National Economic Commission had previously decided to invite the 立法院 and 参政会 to conduct thorough research on technical issues. It is now learned that the 豺部 (Finance Ministry) has drafted a plan for this special donation levy, which will be submitted to a joint meeting of the National Economic Commission, 立法院, and 参政会. Once approved, it will become final. The main points of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Principles: (1) The one-time property tax currently advocated by the general public is not an ordinary property tax, but a tax on the income generated by property. Property income can be levied annually, while the one-time property tax targets the property itself and is levied only once. (2) China's current property donation scheme, in addition to its fiscal purpose, also has the mission of equalizing wealth. If taxes are levied on goods, not only are there too many targets, but it is also easy to involve harassment. Therefore, in principle, individuals should be the main tax subject, and listed property items should be the tax objects. (3) Although it is not easy to conduct a universal survey of the amount of individual property, the wealthy and prominent families in a locality are generally known to the public. Therefore, the property donation scheme should focus on large households as the main body.</p>
<p>B. Levy Targets: Property donation will be levied on individuals whose total property value exceeds 1 billion yuan. Individuals are the main tax subject, and the following properties are the tax objects: (1) land and buildings; (2) deposits, foreign exchange, government bonds, and stocks; (3) gold and foreign currency; (4) movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens in foreign countries; (5) net value of sole proprietorship or partnership businesses; (6) all privately owned means of transportation; (7) machinery and goods. The above listed property items will not be taxed repeatedly when calculating the total value of individual property, and the actual amount of debt can be deducted.</p>
<p>C. Tax Rates: (1) For those exceeding 1 billion yuan, 4% will be levied on the excess. (2) For those exceeding 2 billion yuan, 6% will be levied on the excess. (3) For those exceeding 5 billion yuan, 9% will be levied on the excess. (4) For those exceeding 10 billion yuan, 12% will be levied on the excess. (5) For those exceeding 20 billion yuan, 16% will be levied on the excess. (6) For those exceeding 50 billion yuan, 20% will be levied on the excess. (7) For those exceeding 100 billion yuan, 26% will be levied on the excess. (8) For those exceeding 200 billion yuan, 32% will be levied on the excess.

<h3>Japan Establishes Revolving Fund for Import and Export Trade</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Associated Press] General MacArthur announced that Japan's gold and silver reserves, valued at US$137 million, will be used as a credit basis to obtain loans totaling over US$500 million to finance Japan's foreign trade. According to MacArthur's statement, this Japanese import and export revolving fund can be used as a credit basis for Allied or neutral private or government financial institutions to make advance payments or goods to develop trade with Japan in the future. He stated: "Allied and neutral countries can participate in this loan. These US dollars will be managed and preserved by the manager under the supervision of the Allied Headquarters."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese people were delighted to hear about the establishment of a revolving fund for import and export trade to revive the Japanese economy. All newspapers issued special editions to report the three important news items. Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama also issued a statement, calling it the last piece of good news for Japan since the end of the war. Japanese observers also said that the fund can support the position of the Katayama cabinet, without a doubt, because the cabinet has recently become the target of public criticism due to economic difficulties and serious food situation. On the eve of the opening of international private trade with Japan, the Japanese Parliament passed a resolution today, expressing gratitude to General MacArthur for taking this measure to improve the lives of the people after the war.</p>

<h3>President Zhang's Broadcast Address on the 2nd Anniversary of Victory</h3>
<p>[This City News] Today is the second anniversary of the victory. President Zhang of the Executive Yuan was invited by the American Broadcasting Company to give a broadcast address in Nanjing. The full text of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Chinese people celebrated the anniversary of the victory over Japan with boundless joy. This day represents that the Chinese nation has achieved victory in the struggle against violent aggressors, and also indicates that the ideas of world democracy and peace have ultimately triumphed over fascism and aggression. A period of peace and prosperity has dawned in the Far East. China has benefited from this victory, and other Eastern countries have also benefited. At the same time, it is also the cornerstone of world peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>The facts of the two years since the war have proven that although the United Nations have won the war, the establishment of lasting peace still requires more effort. The difficulties and obstacles China has suffered after the war are no less than those during the war. China is now working to restore unity, eliminate obstacles, engage in construction, improve people's livelihood, and strive for a correct democratic system. It is firmly believed that this effort cannot be hindered by any force, and it is firmly believed that only after these goals are achieved can peace in the Far East and the world be truly guaranteed.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of Opening Private Trade, Allied Headquarters Announces Entry Guidelines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch] On the eve of the reopening of limited private trade, the Allied Headquarters issued detailed guidelines on entry procedures and accommodation for foreign businessmen. Medhans, head of the Foreign Trade Section of the Economic and Scientific Group of the Allied Headquarters, said that businessmen entering Japan are divided into four categories. The largest category is the 400 private trade representatives who will arrive in Japan tomorrow. The second category is the "business representatives" who engage in banking, insurance, and other business trade, and their number is relatively small. The third category is "investment representatives," who will enter Japan later. The fourth category includes "government trade representatives," who are those who handle government-to-government trade affairs at the Allied representative offices in Japan or handle "special commercial negotiations," and can currently enter Japan. The Japanese government's Trade Agency can assume the largest practical task in trade. Mr. Mai declared: "Private trade representatives" can individually negotiate with Japanese retailers and the Trade Agency for approval by the Allied Headquarters. After approval by the Headquarters, the Trade Agency can sign a contract and issue an export license. The price of goods will be paid in common foreign currencies or in mutually convertible currencies by agreement. Mr. Mai said that the Allied Headquarters is not responsible for Japanese goods, nor does it provide guarantees. However, if a dispute arises within 30 days of the goods arriving at the port of destination, the Allied Headquarters will decide. Before private shipping institutions are established, the U.S. Shipping Board will be responsible for port affairs. Hotels in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka require US$10 per day for food and lodging. Before freely convertible currencies are stipulated, special payment certificates will be issued to facilitate purchases by traders. U.S. dollars and Japanese yen can be purchased at designated exchange offices at the exchange rate of US$1 to 50 Japanese yen. Currencies that cannot be immediately exchanged for special payment certificates must be handed over in full within 48 hours of arrival in Japan. When leaving Japan, it is limited to carrying US$150 in cash, and this number cannot be exceeded. Japanese yen is not allowed to be exchanged. Traders can use international mail and domestic mail in Japan, but they are not allowed to use Allied military mail. Commercial telegrams from abroad are allowed to be sent. Passengers traveling by train or car must pay in U.S. dollars. Traders can also use their own transportation methods. Traders enjoy the same legal status as nationals of countries not related to the occupation. Mr. Mai said that they must abide by the criminal law under the rule of the occupying government.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Talks About the Treaty of Peace with Japan; The State of Aggression Should Be Eliminated; Foreign Trade Cannot Allow Dumping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Dr. Wang Chonghui, a jurist and member of the National Government Committee, met with reporters from this newspaper on the afternoon of the 14th to discuss the issue of the treaty of peace with Japan in detail. He believes that the treaty of peace with Japan must be formulated in accordance with two major principles: one is to fundamentally eliminate Japan's aggression, and the other is to give the Japanese people the opportunity to survive peacefully. Regarding the former, Japan's aggression and its systematic existence must be eliminated from all aspects, including military, economic, educational, cultural, and propaganda, and this state of eliminated aggression must be properly maintained. Regarding the latter, the limit to which peaceful survival is attainable should be the limit to the development of Japanese industry and commerce. Its ability to resume dumping of foreign trade should not be allowed, much less to engage in economic aggression and oppress the livelihoods of the people of other Asian countries. Wang agreed that the Emperor System is the center of the Japanese aggression system. From the perspective of international peace and the freedom and happiness of the Japanese people, it should not continue to exist. Only the realization of a republican system can awaken the Japanese people from the theological superstition of the Emperor's omnipotence. As for the status of Ryukyu, he stated: It must not be returned to Japan, but should adopt international joint management or trusteeship (trusteeship by the United Nations agencies or a certain country or several countries) to make it a powerful base and a stabilizing force in the Western Pacific. Regarding the issue of compensation, Wang firmly stated: We should obtain the largest share. Although the assets dismantled by the Soviet Union in the Northeast are not a compensation issue, our country still has the right and should demand compensation at the peace conference. In the conversation, he repeatedly mentioned the lessons learned from the Treaty of Versailles after World War I, which lacked thorough and effective provisions to eliminate Germany's ability to restore aggression, causing Germany to rise again in less than a few decades. He strongly advocated that the signing of the peace treaty is not the ultimate guarantee of peace. The control of Japan should continue uninterrupted to monitor its full implementation of the peace treaty until the policies of the United Nations are fully realized, and then can it be said that the occupation is terminated.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the 2nd Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty; Newspapers in the Capital Hope that the Soviet Union Will Strictly Fulfill its Obligations; Respect China's Territorial Sovereignty and Integrity</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] Today is the 2nd anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Newspapers here have published commentaries on this, hoping that the Soviet Union will abide by its treaty obligations, improve relations, and maintain friendship forever. The editorial of the Central Daily News is extremely brief, with only a few hundred words. The newspaper bluntly pointed out: "The big problem today is not the treaty itself, but whether the signing parties sincerely and strictly fulfill the spirit and terms of the treaty. If both parties sincerely and strictly fulfill it, then the long-term friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union can be guaranteed." Regarding the issue of receiving Lushun and Dalian and 新 (Xinjiang), the newspaper hopes that the Soviet Union will "strictly fulfill its treaty obligations and not make the treaty a dead letter." The Peace Daily first analyzed the three major suggestions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which are to prevent Japanese aggression again, not to interfere in each other's internal affairs, and that the Soviet Union respects China's territorial sovereignty and integrity. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet side's excuses for preventing our country from receiving Lushun and Dalian are all misinterpretations of the treaty provisions." The newspaper concluded that Sino-Soviet cooperation is necessary. We should adhere to the Sino-Soviet Treaty position, seek a solution to the outstanding issues between the two countries, and hope that the Soviet Union will abide by its treaty obligations. The Dagang News was full of emotion for the lack of faithful implementation of the treaty and the lack of maintenance or development of the treaty spirit. After describing the facts that the Soviet army obstructed the reception of the Northeast, dismantled and transported industrial equipment, the Outer Mongolian army invaded Xinjiang, and refused to receive Lushun and Dalian, the newspaper said: "We really have no reason not to doubt and be disappointed with our friendly country, the Soviet Union." The newspaper uses whether the Soviet Union returns Lushun and Dalian as the touchstone of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and hopes that the Soviet Union will "resolutely sever many assistance to the CCP's conspiracy to create chaos," otherwise the unfriendly relations between China and the Soviet Union will not benefit the Soviet Union. The Xinmin News also "sighs" at the development of Sino-Soviet relations in the past two years. The newspaper pointed out that two years ago, the people of the country accepted the treaty with a heavy heart, and the country had paid a considerable price. As a result, various events in the past two years have led Sino-Soviet relations astray. The newspaper does not agree with blindly opposing the Soviet Union, "and we are also extremely unwilling for our treaty country to exceed the scope of the treaty and harm the country's territorial sovereignty. We hope that our Soviet friends can value the dignity of the treaty as much as we do, and do not cross the line. Only with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance as the cornerstone can friendly and peaceful relations between China and the Soviet Union be established."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The 14th is the 2nd anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. The Central Daily News' brief and objective editorial can well represent the government's position, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not issue a statement. The reporter interviewed some important people to discuss the current Sino-Soviet diplomatic situation. The following is a record of the interviews. Vice President Wu of the 立法院 (Legislative Yuan) said: "Whether Sino-Soviet relations have improved depends on whether the treaty has been fulfilled in the past two years. Whoever fails to fulfill it is responsible, which is also the reason why we cannot fully recover the sovereignty of the Northeast. This reason is the responsibility of those who fail to fulfill the treaty, which is a great regret. In the future, China and the Soviet Union should work hard to fully implement the treaty to maintain good relations between the two countries."</p>
<h3>Attention Should Be Paid to the Spirit of the Treaty, Based on Equality and Friendship; Wang Chonghui Talks About the Sino-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>Member Wang Chonghui of the National Government Committee believes that the contracting parties should respect the spirit of the treaty and should not be preoccupied with a one-sided interpretation of the words. Although the various provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship give the Soviet Union certain convenient rights and interests, its basic spirit is equality and friendship. The dispute today is that the problem arises when China exercises its sovereignty in its territory, which is by no means the original intention of the treaty. From a legal point of view, regarding the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, our side is standing firmly on the ground, in terms of feelings, reason, and law. If Sino-Soviet relations are affected in any way, our country will not be responsible." A revolutionary pioneer in both Xinjiang and Tibet, recounting that when the Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed, our side was purely passive. At that time, the issue in Xinjiang had already started, and we hoped to use the treaty to secure Xinjiang. Who knew that after two years, the issue has not subsided, and another disaster has arisen in the eastern border. He believes that being passive has no better ending, and being proactive is at most just this. Building a country is an important task in the history of the revolution. Revolutionary diplomacy should not hesitate to remove the obstacles of evil forces. However, he still believes that in being a person and in building a country, we should understand the important saying of "not going too far," and those who should be responsible should quickly seek to resolve the crux of the problems between China and the Soviet Union, which is a great fortune! Bai Yunti, Deputy Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, believes that the Sino-Soviet Treaty has not been fully implemented, which is an obvious fact. As for the basis of the Outer Mongolian border line, it was indeed clearly stated in the treaty, and no unauthorized claims or unilateral changes are allowed. The relationship between Inner and Outer Mongolia was originally peaceful, but the border issue suddenly arose, which is not without reason. It is hoped that such unreasonable disputes will be eliminated because the Sino-Soviet Treaty of the East is valued. In addition, Shao Lizhi, Secretary-General of the Council, who once served as the ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Wang Shijie, the Minister of Foreign Affairs who signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty, were also the targets of the reporter's interviews, but they remained silent.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] According to political observers here, two years after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, China currently finds that its relationship with the Soviet Union is far less friendly than in August 1945, and that in both spirit and action, there is actually no alliance at all. This sign can be seen from the fact that there are no congratulatory telegrams on the second anniversary of the signing of the treaty.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 14th Dispatch] The 14th is the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Newspapers in Pan all published articles discussing it in detail, expressing regret over the delayed reception of Lushun and Dalian.</p>
<h3>Wei Envoy to Inspect Guangzhou: Met with Various Circles All Day Yesterday in Shanghai, and Visited Madame Sun to Inquire About the Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Wei Demai, the special envoy, was busy yesterday in Shanghai meeting with people from all walks of life to solicit their opinions on the current situation. At 9:30 a.m., Yang Hu, chairman of the Seamen's Party Department, visited. At around 10:00 a.m., He Dehui visited but did not meet. At around 10:30 a.m., the special envoy met with Wu Xianzi, Wang Shiming, Yao Yongli, key members of the Innovation faction of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Guo Moruo, Sha Qianli, Dong Shijin, Hu Juewen, Shen Tilan, and other representatives of the China Democratic League. It is said that the visitors made many suggestions regarding the current situation, and the conversation lasted for more than an hour. According to Wang Shiming, he told reporters: "When I met with Envoy Wei today, I submitted a brief memorandum, which mainly included three points: (1) Find a way to end the domestic military conflict as soon as possible. (2) The democratic forces of the third party should occupy a position in Chinese politics. (3) Political reforms should be carried out, and civil rights should be guaranteed." In the afternoon, Envoy Wei drove to visit Madame Sun Qingling, inquiring about her views on the current situation. At 6 p.m., acting Consul General Mayer held a cocktail party at the Hamilton Building to introduce people from various circles, both Chinese and foreign, in the city to meet the special envoy. More than 40 people, including Mayor Wu, Zhao Zengjue, Zhao Zukang, Li Fusun, Ding Guitang, Bei Zuyi, Tu Yuqing, and Hu Shixun, attended. The party ended joyfully at around 8 p.m. Envoy Wei and his party are scheduled to fly to Guangzhou this morning around 8 a.m. for inspection.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Dong Shijin, leader of the Chinese Peasants' Party, was invited to meet with Special Envoy Wei yesterday and submitted a memorandum containing six points: (1) the root of the chaos, (2) the weakness of politics, (3) the poverty of the economy, (4) the special suffering of the peasants, (5) the crux of the Chinese problem, (6) China and the world.</p>
<h3>It is Said That Envoy Wei Will Propose That the United Nations Participate in Mediating Our Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press This City Report] Well-informed sources say that Wei Demai will propose three major plans to Truman after investigating the Chinese situation. One of them will suggest that the United Nations mediate the current situation in China to avoid China becoming the fuse for a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United Nations should take this action. It is heard that this plan may also include a suggestion to put a certain number of regions in China under trusteeship. For the remaining two plans, Wei Demai may suggest that the United States either completely withdraw its assistance and influence from China, except for maintaining normal diplomatic relations with China, or implement large-scale, full assistance and supervision to achieve the United States' objectives there. Reliable sources here say that the important factors in Wei Demai's mission are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wei Demai is now meticulously collecting facts and seriously making his final decision.</p>
<p>(2) Wei Demai is conducting investigation and research work in a completely objective manner and will never be influenced by the friendship of any Chinese person.</p>
<p>(3) Wei Demai does not favor any party or group.</p>
<p>(4) Wei Demai is not unaware of the shortcomings of the Kuomintang government. He has served in China and has obtained good cooperation from the Chinese government, but he will weigh the importance of official information and other reports.</p>
<p>(5) The premise of Wei Demai's mission is to "contain communism," so what needs to be pointed out is that the CCP area cannot be allowed to become a satellite area of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(6) It is impossible for China to form a united government, because the Communist Party cannot be satisfied and wants to continue the struggle to achieve its overall control.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] US Treasury Secretary Snyder said at a press conference today that he had not learned that Wei Demai would have any suggestions on financial assistance. If there are any suggestions, they must be approved by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary Problems.</p>

<h3>Remnants of Bandits in Western Shandong Forcibly Crossed, Were Fiercely Annihilated; Center of War Situation Moved to Eastern Henan; National Army Recaptured Anbian on the Border of Ningxia and Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 14th] The remnants of the Communist bandits in Western Shandong, Zhao Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 7th Columns, about 30,000 people, have fled south of the Longhai Railway. The center of the war has moved to eastern Henan. Liu's 1st and 7th Columns fled south from the area between Liuhe and Yejiling on the evening of the 12th to the east of Sui County. The 2nd and 6th Columns fled from west of Shangqiu to the area of Xiangcheng and Hao County on the night of the 13th. The National Army intercepted them fiercely between Xiaowu and Shangqiu, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties. Liu's 3rd Column is currently surrounded and annihilated by the National Army in Xieji near Chucheng. The remnants of its Independent Brigade, more than 4,000 people, have been surrounded in Fantikou, south of Chengwu, and are being fiercely annihilated. Furthermore, more than 3,000 remnants of the 1st, 4th, and 10th Columns of the Communist Army's East China Field Army crossed the Yellow River north from Zhujialou, west of Dong'a, on the 13th. The National Army intercepted them and annihilated more than 1,000 bandits. Moreover, more than 6,000 bandits in the Dongming Lake area have surrendered to the National Army in the past week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th] The National Army has now won a decisive victory in the battle in the triangle area of Lushan and Liangshanzhai. The 1st, 4th, 8th, and 10th Columns of the Communist bandits' East China Field Army have almost been completely annihilated, with a total loss of more than three-fifths. Since Yucheng and Yuncheng, at the southern end of Liangshanzhai, were successively recovered, the brave and sharp National Army immediately adopted a separation tactic to separate the "New Fourth" and "Eighth Route" systems among the Communist bandits, so that they fled north and south, and then defeated them one by one. The remnants of the 1st, 4th, 8th, and 10th Columns of the Communist bandits' "New Fourth" system of the East China Field Army were guided by this strategic guidance of the National Army and fled north to the triangle area of Liangshanzhai, and were then encircled by the National Army using the natural situation where the Yellow River and the canal intersect. On the evening of the 11th, the bandits could not withstand the pressure of the shrinking encirclement and abandoned Liangshanzhai, and seized the villages and towns of Shilitang and Jiajiahai, where the Yellow River and the canal intersect, in an attempt to cross the Yellow River and escape north. Among them were a large number of wounded bandits, baggage carts, and looted civilian women. When they fled north across Liangshanzhai, they were ambushed by the National Army. After a fierce battle until the morning of the 13th, the remnants of the Communist bandits suffered heavy losses. A large number of baggage carts, wounded bandits, and civilian women were seized and rescued by the National Army. The number of those who managed to cross the Yellow River and escape north was very small. The war situation in Western Shandong, centered on the triangle area of Liangshanzhai, was thus declared over.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th] The National Army pursuing the Communist bandits northward in the Ningling-Suixian area engaged in fierce fighting with the fleeing Communist bandits on the 13th, which continued until late at night. Another brigade of Communist bandits attacked Shangqiu on the 13th and were met by the National Army, suffering heavy casualties.</p>
<p>[Another Report, Kaifeng, 14th] Liu Bocheng's remnant troops, at the end of their rope, attempted to flee across the river, but their plan was shattered by the National Army. In order to prolong their last gasp, they fled south through the gaps. Except for a part that was still surrounded by the National Army between Dingtao and Juye and was about to be annihilated, the remnant troops that fled to the area south of Cao County and north of Minlanliu were wiped out by the National Army after days of suppression. They crossed the Longhai Railway on the nights of the 11th and 12th. Their advance troops had reached the border of Luyi County, and the main force was between Suixian and Ningling. The National Army is now capturing and eliminating them with thunderous force. There are no traces of bandits near Minquan now, and the Longhai Railway has not suffered major damage. The railway bureau is rushing to repair it.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Han Boliang, Lin Zhizhen, and Zhang Guangfa, youth soldier representatives of the 2nd Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, flew to Yan'an last month to visit the current situation after Yan'an was recaptured, and returned to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. Mr. Han Boliang spoke to reporters on the 14th at the Political Department of the Second Brigade, Xinhua Yicun, Xitiyu Road, about the recent situation in Yan'an:</p>
<p>During the Communist Bandit Occupation</p>
<p>(A) The political situation of the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi: (1) The Party is above everything, completely adopting dictatorial and violent means, (2) The secret service organization is strict, (3) Enslaving the people of northern Shaanxi to consolidate their pseudo-regime, (4) Deceiving the people with the slogan of democracy. (B) Economic aspects: (1) Using a realistic plundering policy, (2) Using the name of struggle and liquidation to lure poor people, turning the well-off into the poor, and turning the poor into bandits, (3) The violent land policy, after liquidating the people's land, the government used the pretext of helping the landlords to take it back and redistribute it, in order to increase military expenses, (4) Using the planting of opium and levying taxes to poison the people to remedy the lack of finance, encouraging the people to plant opium, and transporting the harvested opium to the border for sale. (C) Educational and cultural aspects: (1) Creating tools of partyization, educating to empower the Party, rather than educating to cultivate national talents, (2) Making students loyal slaves of the Communist bandits, (3) Unequal opportunities for schooling, there are only two elementary schools and one normal school in the entire Yan'an, except for the children of Communist bandit cadres who have the opportunity to study for free, the people must pay tuition fees, and after the age of fifteen, they must be managed by the Communist bandits, causing people to dare not send their children to school, resulting in a serious illiteracy situation in northern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>After the National Army Recovered</p>
<p>Since the National Army recovered Yan'an, Yan'an, after half a year of governance, has made great progress. During the Communist bandit occupation, this small city with more than 32,000 people had endured 13 years of "daring to be angry but not daring to speak," and now more than 21,000 people have returned to their homeland and started to live and work in peace and contentment. They rarely wore a complete set of clothes in the past, but now they have put on the clothes rescued by the government. Everyone is wearing a set of white shirts and black trousers, clean and tidy, showing smiling faces, symbolizing a kind of joyful phenomenon, revealing that they have turned from darkness to light. The visiting group visited the People's Education Center, and a large hall displayed opium seeds left by the Communist bandits, which is conclusive evidence of the Communist bandits poisoning the people. Then, we visited the "National Army People's Service Center," where the staff were busy handling emergency relief work. The personnel of the Family Mutual Aid Society solved the difficulties for the people who came back day and night. Children over the age of five can be sent to the Bao National Elementary School for free, and the county government provides books. When the "visiting group" participated in the singing competition of students from five elementary schools, the innocent and lively students were able to sing the Yangko of "President Chiang is the Great Savior of the People." According to Yan'an Commissioner Zhu Baoli, various small-scale industries have begun to be prepared, and they are already preparing to run Yan'an Middle School. The most regrettable thing is that there is still no hospital in Yan'an. The engineering department is repairing the roads along the city, and the Agricultural Bank has begun to handle agricultural loans. Under the slogan "Politics is more important than military affairs," all levels of personnel are confident in rebuilding northern Shaanxi. The government also hopes that young people with aspirations can actively participate in the construction of the Great Northwest.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The Four Banks Joint Office held its 350th board meeting this morning. Chairman Yu Hongjun presided. The meeting first discussed the future lending policy. The directors expressed many opinions, all believing that in order to cooperate with the government's tightening policy, all non-essential loans should be suspended. The use of all loans that have already been made should be strengthened for assessment and auditing to effectively prevent the loan funds from flowing to non-productive channels.

The important points are as follows: (1) The ordinary agricultural loans for this year were previously approved at 100 billion yuan, and another 2 billion yuan of Northeast circulation coupons.

<h3>An Overview of the Disaster Area in Northern Jiangsu: A Vast Expanse of Water, No Traces of Human Habitation; Good Farmland Submerged by Water</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] In the scorching heat of over a hundred degrees in the air, reporters and others followed Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Xueshi and Vice Minister Shen Baixian to inspect the flood in northern Jiangsu. A group of more than 20 people departed from the foot of Zijin Mountain, flew over the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Huai River, and flew along the disaster-stricken Jinpu Road to Xuzhou. Then, circling around Weishan Lake, we made a turn to the upstream and downstream of the Yishui and Shushui rivers, soaring over Linyi, Shuyang, and other places. Often, we flew in a color of water and sky for 30 to 50 minutes. When we came back, everyone's mood was heavy.</p>
<p>Six hours of intense flight, more than 800 miles of aerial observation, revealed a shocking fact. In an area only 400 kilometers away from Shanghai, there is land more than ten times the area of Shanghai, submerged by floods, and people more than twice the population of Shanghai are living a life of suffering in the floods. Some of these waters have receded a little, and some are continuing to rise. If they are not quickly managed, then the disaster area will inevitably continue to expand, and the distance from the Yangtze River should also be closer. By then, not only will the entire northern Jiangsu become a swamp, but the prosperous Beijing-Shanghai area will also be completely submerged.</p>
<p>This year's flood in northern Jiangsu was caused by excessive rainfall, plus water from Shandong, which made the situation even worse. The first thing that appeared in our eyes in the flooded area of ​​northern Jiangsu was Weishan Lake on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong. This large lake, famous at home and abroad during the War of Resistance, does not have the beauty of Taihu Lake, and cannot compare with Dianchi Lake in Kunming. Even if there is a little beauty worth reminiscing, it has been painted with a gloomy gray color by the ruthless water. We flew over around 12 o'clock, eating lunch prepared for us by the Ministry of Water Conservancy, while looking at the ground (should be said to be the water surface) to see if there were any chimneys smoking. There is no houses in a large area, so there is no chimneys to talk about; in some places, we occasionally see one or two houses, with one or two dead trees standing next to them, but no smoke is coming out of the chimneys. Looking through the binoculars, there are no traces of human habitation, perhaps they have already moved. One or two feet of water completely submerged the road. Several boats were moving things. We watched the miracle of "land sailing" with heavy hearts. A colleague from Shanghai asked how big the area flooded by water was. The reporter could not answer, and turned to ask the water conservancy expert next to him. This old gentleman had not been to Shanghai, so he only pointed to the map and said to the reporter: The area flooded by water includes a part of Shandong and Pei County in Jiangsu, and a part of Xuzhou. How many Shanghais do you think there are?</p>
<p>In Huangji and Daxujia, which belong to Pixian on the Longhai Railway, we saw scenes of houses on high ground surrounded by water. In the sky, we could vaguely see the lines formed by the roads submerged by water, which were half a foot or a foot deep, but many places were dry land without water, and some places the water had receded a little. According to a colleague who came last year, the water in northern Jiangsu this year is not as big as last year.</p>
<p>It was too hot, and the plane was flying too low. Some people couldn't stand it and pretended to sleep, only a few experts were still turning over maps and taking pictures. This silence did not last long, and was broken by Minister Xue: "The plane has flown to the largest disaster area in northern Jiangsu!" Every plane window had anxious gazes looking. Good guys, how much water there is! And it is all gray and black, at least two or three feet, maybe more. These stretch from near Suqian all the way north, Muyang, Donghai, Guanyun, how many counties, hundreds of thousands of acres of the best fields are soaked in the water, at least as big as Taihu Lake, no human habitation, at most you can see the tops of a few trees. The plane circled over the muddy water, not believing that this used to be land. Not even a single boat can be seen, it is simply a sea. This sea does not know how many people's blood and sweat it has swallowed, and how many people's families it has destroyed. Compatriots more than twice the population of Shanghai are in deep water and suffering, and an area several times larger than Shanghai is all submerged by water. This water may come to Shanghai one day. Compatriots in Shanghai, please do not look at this matter with an attitude of "watching the fire from the other side of the river."</p>
<h3>Editorial: What Will Japan Be Like Two Years From Now?</h3>
<p>Two years ago today, after several days of hesitation, Japan finally formally accepted the Potsdam Declaration. The Japanese Emperor delivered a radio address to the nation, announcing Japan's surrender to the Allied forces. Thus, the Second World War, after eight years of gunfire, came to an end. August 15th, therefore, is the most glorious day in human history, especially in modern Chinese history. In theory, we should greet the arrival of this great anniversary of victory with the most jubilant emotions and the most cheerful hearts. However, two years later, when we encounter this epoch-making anniversary today, we are filled with mixed feelings, with countless thoughts and words, and we truly don't know where to begin!</p>
<p>We don't need to dwell on the past, nor do we need to darkly hope for the future. Just looking at the regulations for opening up Japan's foreign trade announced yesterday by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo is enough to make us feel sentimental. The content of this regulation stipulates four methods for opening up Japan's foreign trade: (1) Foreign businessmen trading with Japan will be divided into four categories: 1. Representatives of private trade; 2. Representatives of transportation, insurance, and other industries; 3. Representatives of investors; 4. Government representatives. (2) All contacts between representatives of private trade and Japanese merchants or the Japanese Ministry of Commerce must be approved by the Allied Headquarters. (3) All export permits issued by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce must be approved by the Allied Headquarters. (4) The prices of Japanese goods shall be quoted in US dollars. Superficially, the opening of Japan's private foreign trade seems to be a "partial" opening. Everything must be at the command of the Allied Headquarters, and no free development is allowed. However, in practice, opening up Japan's private foreign trade, whether viewed from an economic or political perspective, is ultimately a major encouragement to defeated Japan. No wonder the Japanese are secretly smiling again. Japan, defeated by the Allied countries, is already planning its comeback in less than two years. How can this not be seen as a warning sign for victorious China?</p>
<p>From a long-term perspective, there are many debatable aspects of the United States' policy towards Japan. However, the US supports defeated Japan, on the one hand, to reduce the cost of the US occupation of Japan, and on the other hand, it hopes that Japan can serve the US in the Far East in the future, just as Japan did for Britain during the Anglo-Japanese Alliance era. MacArthur's policy towards Japan is therefore able to gain the support of the American people, and the reason lies in this. Such a short-sighted policy is enough to cause immeasurable consequences. We should stand as friends and awaken the vigilance of the US government and the public. However, the most important thing for us is to reflect on ourselves and do our best. First, China is one of the victorious nations against Japan, and in the Far Eastern Commission, it is also one of the four powers with veto power. China also has full say in the decision-making of the Allied policy towards Japan. Have our diplomatic authorities ever argued on principle against resolutions that are unfavorable to China? Second, although the opening of Japan's private foreign trade is an order from the Allied Headquarters, each country has the freedom to decide whether to open trade with Japan. We know that opening Japanese trade at present will do more harm than good to China. Why does the government still decide to open it despite the opposition of the people? Third, we assume that the government has decided to open trade with Japan and that there are indeed sufficient reasons. That is, all future trade with Japan will be under strict government and business control, so as not to allow Japanese goods to come in like a landslide. However, we still have to ask the government whether it has strict preventive measures against the large-scale smuggling of Japanese goods in the future? Are there any concrete measures to help domestic industries from being affected by the opening of trade with Japan? Now the national business community is in a state of anxiety. Can the government provide them with strong guarantees?</p>
<p>In short, today is the anniversary of Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, and it is also the day of the opening of Japan's foreign trade. We are happy and fearful at the same time. We are certainly willing to give the Japanese people an opportunity to coexist peacefully, but to ensure victory, we should take precautions against Japan's comeback everywhere, so that this aggressive train can no longer start. Although the opening of Japan's private foreign trade is a partial opening and is subject to the management of the Allied Headquarters, it is the first step for Japan to start its comeback after its defeat, which makes us have to raise our vigilance against Japan. "After accepting the Potsdam Declaration, Japan was able to obtain the opening of private foreign trade in less than two years before the peace treaty was signed, and obtained American loans. The speed of the defeated country's trend towards recovery is almost unparalleled in modern history. Even today's Germany is inevitably dwarfed in comparison. Although the United States also wanted to support Germany first, but when Britain and the United States conducted negotiations to raise the level of German industry, because of France's firm opposition, they had to give up. France in wartime did not know my position, but why is it that France after the war can maintain its inherent position in Europe, and how can it use its diplomatic means to ensure its favorable position towards Germany? This is what deserves our attention most.</p>
<h3>Donate to Disaster Relief!</h3>
<p>In the past month, reports of disasters in the country have been pouring in. In addition to the major floods in the Yellow River, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and northern Jiangsu are also experiencing floods. The severity of the disasters is shocking. The people have endured eight years of hardship during the Anti-Japanese War, and now they are suffering from natural disasters. How unfortunate it is!</p>
<p>China, to this day, is a country that is established based on agriculture, and 80% of the population are farmers, who rely on cultivation to make a living. The prosperity or decline of the rural economy is the sole measure of the rise and fall of the national economy. To be honest, today's rural areas in various places, even without unexpected natural disasters, have already fallen into the brink of bankruptcy. The average farmer can hardly breathe under the burden of life. How can they withstand the impact of natural disasters again! We have studied the causes of floods in various provinces, and they are all due to the disrepair of farmland irrigation. Since ancient times, our country has attached great importance to the construction and renovation of farmland irrigation, not only to prevent floods in rural areas, but also to prevent droughts. However, in the past decade, because of the Anti-Japanese War, the areas occupied by the enemy were ravaged by the enemy, and the fields were already barren. Even in the rural areas in the rear, on the one hand, because of the lack of science, and on the other hand, because they were unable to take care of them during the war, the rural economy has also become depressed. The occurrence of this year's floods can be said to be a natural disaster, but it can also be said to be a man-made disaster, and in northern Jiangsu, which has suffered the destruction of the communist bandits, it is especially the result of a major disaster and man-made disaster!</p>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi are the source of the Chinese revolution, Sichuan is the base of our country's Anti-Japanese War, and northern Jiangsu is the front line of the country's suppression of bandits and rebellion today. People across the country cannot stand idly by and watch the millions of disaster victims in the above-mentioned areas without food and clothing and nowhere to turn. Especially the citizens of our Shanghai, who have been living a normal life, should be able to empathize with these disaster victims who are waiting to be fed, take the initiative to exert themselves, and actively contribute to reduce their suffering.</p>
<p>Jiangsu party and government leaders and representatives of public opinion organs came to Shanghai yesterday to jointly invite the reporters of this city to report on the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu in detail, and to appeal to all sectors of Shanghai for disaster relief. How can the citizens of Shanghai remain unmoved when they hear this urgent call for help? Shanghai is the center of national industry and commerce, and the place where national wealth accumulates. There are many citizens who are happy to do good and are eager to help others. Now, the compatriots in the disaster-stricken provinces are looking forward to the citizens of Shanghai, and their emotions cannot be described in words. The citizens of Shanghai have always believed that "helping others is the source of happiness," and they will not easily give up this good opportunity to "do good and enjoy the most."</p>
<h3>Wang Maogong Reports on the Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 14th] Wang Maogong took a special plane at 10:00 this morning to conduct an aerial survey of the floods in Pei, Xiao, and Dang. He returned to Xuzhou at 12:00 and hosted reporters at 5:00 p.m. to report on the disaster situation. The traffic between Xu, Huai, and Hai in northern Jiangsu was completely cut off by the water. 17 of the 36 counties and cities in northern Jiangsu were affected, with 30 million mu of farmland flooded and more than 9 million disaster victims. Among them, the disasters in Pixian, Xiaoxian, Donghai, Guanyun, and Shuyang were the most severe. The entire territory was submerged, and the disaster victims were in urgent need of relief. He took a night military plane to Beijing at 9:00.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 14th] According to a report from the Jiangsu government: The first detachment of the Communist bandits in the Huaihai area, in order to prevent the National Army from suppressing them, recently dug up the dike of the Chaimi River in Tangjianju, the fifth district of Shuyang. Now the northeastern townships of the district have become a swamp.</p>

<h3>End of 200 Years of British Rule, Two Independent Dominions Established in India, Simple and Solemn Ceremony for the Transfer of Power</h3>

<h3>The Situation in Palestine is Increasingly Tense, Major Conflicts Between Jews and Arabs, Jews Accuse the British of Manipulating Behind the Scenes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 14th] After the first direct conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine in 72 hours since 1939, the Arab market in Jaffa's old city was set on fire last night by 50 Jewish youths. The border between the Jewish and Arab districts of Tel Aviv has become a no-man's land, with only police patrolling. Both Jews and Arabs know that the great conflicts between the two races in 1936-39 were similar to the current situation when they first appeared.</p>
<p>This conflict began on Sunday night, when several Arab youths attacked a coffee shop run by a Jew in Tel Aviv, killing five Jews. Now there are barbed wire fences between the Jewish and Arab districts of Tel Aviv and Jaffa. Last night, hundreds of Jews fled the Jewish church in Tel Aviv to prevent retaliation from the Arabs. The Jewish underground organization Irgun issued a statement last night, pointing out that the British spies and weapons manipulated the conflicts in the past 72 hours, so "the British are still the main enemy of the Jews."</p>

<h3>Six Senior Officials of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Accused of Group Corruption: Five Major Crimes Listed, Including Embezzlement of Supplies and Transportation Kickbacks</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA); Hu Keshi, Director of the Fisheries Management Office; Dong Chengdao, Director of the Finance Office; Zhan Jiechang, Director of the Procurement and Sales Office; Chen Guangyuan, Director of the Storage and Transportation Office; and Xu Shichang, Director of the General Affairs Office, have recently been secretly reported to the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office and the District Prosecutor's Office, listing five counts of corruption against Li and others. The contents are roughly as follows: (1) Embezzlement in the allocation of electric fans: The actual number allocated was only over 10,000 units, with an allocated price of 400,000 yuan per fan (the market price is about 1,000,000 yuan), while the Procurement and Sales Office reported that it had sold more than 20,000 units, embezzling more than 10,000 units. For example, the China Merchants Bureau applied to purchase 200 electric fans in a letter, but the office forced the China Merchants Bureau to change the application to 300 fans, while only 200 fans were actually allocated. The China Merchants Bureau has a record to prove this. (2) Embezzlement in the cotton-for-yarn exchange: According to regulations, 600 pounds of cotton should be exchanged for 400 pounds of yarn, but the RRA recorded 690 pounds of cotton for 400 pounds of yarn, with the extra 90 pounds being embezzled. (3) Technical embezzlement in the watering of wheat: According to regulations, 90 pounds of flour should be milled from 100 pounds of wheat, but in milling, water must be added. By adding 5 pounds of water per dan (unit of weight), 95 pounds of flour are milled from 105 pounds of wheat. This surplus of 5 pounds is also embezzled. (4) Embezzlement in transportation kickbacks: The RRA's transportation of supplies is partly contracted out to transportation companies, with kickbacks as high as 30%. With more than 2 million tons of materials transported, the total income will reach tens of billions of yuan, and this huge sum also falls into the hands of the corrupt group. (5) Deputy Director Li's extravagant lifestyle is paid for by the RRA: Li's residence at 570 Jianguo West Road (the former residence of the traitor Wang Jingwei) has all its appliances and sundry items paid for by the RRA, and the RRA also hires as many as 18 servants. Two tons of coal are used each month, supplied by the RRA, and two refrigerators for the hospital were also moved to Li's mansion this summer. Furthermore, the estimated assets of the Director of Finance amount to US$500,000, and the Director of General Affairs owns as many as three cars. The source of these enjoyments is questionable.</p>
<h3>Revealing the Bribery of Officials from the Import Management Committee: Altering the Date on the Delivery Order, the Case is Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Chen Ruihao, manager of Baolin Import and Export Company at 330 North Sichuan Road, ordered 200 boxes of aluminum sheets from the United States last year. The goods arrived in Shanghai on March 20th of this year. Chen applied to the Import Management Committee for import, but the committee did not approve it due to restrictions. Chen had already sold the order to a certain cigarette factory. Because he could not pick up the goods on time, the buyer negotiated with Chen to return the deposit. Later, Ling Chongren, an official of the Provisional Import Management Committee, was approached for help and a bribe of 140 million yuan was offered. Ling changed the import date on the delivery order to February 22, 1946, and the committee approved it. When picking up the goods from customs, customs officials were suspicious as to why the goods were not approved the first time but were approved the second time. The investigation department used X-rays to examine the delivery order and found that the date had been altered. The aluminum sheets were seized and the above situation was notified to the Import Management Committee on suspicion of document forgery by Chen et al. The Executive Committee of the Import Management Committee sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. In addition to the suspects Chen Ruihao and Ling Chongren, there are also related parties: Zhang Rongsheng, manager of Huatong Cigarette Factory, and Huang Xianzhi, manager of Xinhua Tobacco Company. The cabinet will summon the suspects and related parties for interrogation.</p>

<h3>If Dance Halls Are Banned, Social Flowers Will Abound: They Will Still Be Active in Secret, Only Reducing Tax Revenue; It is Better to Impose Restrictions Through Taxation, Achieving Two Goals at Once</h3>
<p>New Dance Halls Will Be Banned from Next Month</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the "Measures for the General Mobilization Festival" stipulated the banning of commercial dance halls nationwide, people in Shanghai have a sense of "spoiling the scenery." What makes the financial authorities feel even more of a headache is that tax revenue will inevitably be hit as a result, reducing a large source of income. The city's financial revenue has always relied on "entertainment tax" as one of its main sources. Although business tax has been in first place in recent months, entertainment tax still ranks second in the city's revenue. According to statistics from the Finance Bureau: among the city's entertainment tax, dance hall revenue accounts for about 1 billion yuan, other bars and cafes with dancing facilities account for about 600 million yuan, and the entertainment tax portion of Western restaurants with dancing facilities totals nearly 2 billion yuan, accounting for 40% of the entire entertainment tax revenue.</p>
<p>The municipal government believes that completely banning dancing in Shanghai will not be as easy as imagined. Those who make a living from it may still be active in secret by "stealing the sky and changing the day." Therefore, some people believe that instead of banning it without stopping it, which reduces government revenue, it is better to "impose restrictions through taxation," increasing tax revenue and achieving two goals at once.</p>
<p>Implementing Rules Are Under Review</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, was summoned to Beijing some days ago to discuss this matter. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Wu, the principle of banning dancing has been approved by the National Economic Commission, and the detailed implementation measures are being reviewed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Social Affairs, together with relevant agencies. However, it has been stipulated that from September 1st, no new dance halls will be allowed to be established, and the existing dance halls will be phased out. The "phased" explanation refers to giving the dancers and employees who make a living from it sufficient time and opportunity to engage in other occupations. However, this does not apply to those who bring their own dance partners to places like the Cathay Hotel's music hall.</p>
<p>Wu added that if commercial dance halls are banned in Shanghai, the dancers will all flow into the disguised "social flower" camp. In the future, customers bringing these kinds of girls to music cafes would be no different from changing the soup but not the medicine. In the past, dancers mostly held licenses issued by the police station, making them easier to manage. After the dance halls are abolished, this group of dancers will no longer be subject to the control of the police station, and problems will inevitably arise. Furthermore, Shanghai's environment is unique. Unlike Nanjing and Hangzhou, which have scenic mountains and rivers to enjoy, Shanghai has a larger population than other places. Due to the lack of proper entertainment, in the past many people used singing and dancing venues as good places to "enjoy the mountains and rivers." Therefore, after dancing is banned, what we must consider is how to guide them onto the path of proper entertainment.</p>
<p>Actual Number of Dancers is 1,700</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the total number of registered dancers in Shanghai is 4,822. However, many of them have dropped out of school due to the summer vacation, or have gone to Hong Kong and Qingdao to "pan for gold," or have married and changed careers. According to the police station's recent statistics, the actual number is only 1,776. However, this number will increase sharply after the autumn cools down. As for the existing dance halls in Shanghai, there are more than 20, including Da Hu, Xian Le, Gaoshi Man, Vienna, MGM, Lido, Paramount, New Xianlin, Da Du Hui, Xiao Du Hui, Lide Er, Jinshan, Far East, Yangzi, Central, Da Dong, New Du Hui, Victory, Da Lu, Da Hua, Xinhua, Gao Ju, Wei Yun, Hua Du, and Huang Gong. In addition, the total number of bars with dancers is as high as 424.</p>
<p>In the midst of this ban on dancing, American journalists have also shown great "interest." A reporter from the Associated Press said: "The Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau doesn't seem to be in favor of it: he has two reasons, (1) There are 20,000 people in Shanghai who rely on dancing to make a living. (2) If dancing is banned, foreign sailors will need other amusements when they come ashore."</p>

<p>Total of Nineteen Military Police Detained</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 11 military police and 8 police officers, totaling 19 people, had been detained. It is reported that the Municipal Police Bureau repeatedly negotiated with Director Liu and Section Chief Bao, requesting that the eight detained police officers be handed over to the police bureau for self-custody. Director Liu stated that he did not intend to approve their request before the hearing. After the hearing, if their crimes were relatively minor, both the military police and police officers could request bail.

<h3>Absurd Testament, Unrepentant to the End, Enemy Liyang Military Police Sergeant Tomita Toku Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday, Still Stubbornly Shouting "Tenno Heika Banzai" Before Execution</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Tomita Toku, a Japanese war criminal and sergeant of the Liyang Military Police, previously sentenced to death by a military tribunal, was executed by firing squad at the Shanghai Prison execution ground yesterday morning. The condemned made arrogant remarks and still shouted "Tenno Heika Banzai" before execution, unrepentant to the end, showing the deep poison of militarism. At a time when Japan is striving to rise again, this should serve as a warning to us.</p>
<p>Counter-insurgency specialist, brutally murdered</p>
<p>Tomita Toku, age 29, was from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, and was a sergeant in the Liyang Japanese Military Police. During the occupied period, there was a Liyang native named Di Weicheng, a graduate of the Whampoa Military Academy, who served as the lieutenant colonel staff director of the 6th Detachment of the Loyal National Salvation Army, and the colonel training officer of the army headquarters, and also returned to his hometown with the rank of major general to serve as a counter-insurgency specialist. On the morning of March 26th, 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), Tomita Toku led a team to arrest him, using torture to force a confession, leaving him covered in injuries. Because Di refused to confess, on the night of June 4th, Di's mouth and eyes were tightly bound, and he was beaten to death, placed in a straw bag, transported to a wasteland, butchered, breaking his arms and legs, buried in a shallow grave, and his body was forbidden to be collected.</p>
<p>Fallen in irrigation water, slammed against wall, burned by fire</p>
<p>There was also Cao Ke, who was also arrested on April 1st, 34th year of the Republic of China for counter-insurgency work, and after Tomita Toku used torture to force a confession, he was knocked down in irrigation water, his shoulders were crushed, slammed against the wall, burned by fire, a stone was placed on his back, and dogs were sicced on him, but fortunately they sniffed without biting, avoiding death. However, the bone injuries have not yet healed, and the burn marks still exist. Shi Bianchen was also arrested on April 8th of the same year, beaten on the back with bamboo sticks, causing the skin to break and bleed, and threatened with irrigation and dog bites, detained for half a month, and only given two fist-sized rice balls. He was forced to drink smelly water from the gutter, and later feigned madness to escape. After the victory, Di's wife, Di Fangdexian, submitted a complaint to the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, ordering the prisoner of war management office to transfer the defendant to the military tribunal for investigation and prosecution. After the trial, the court found the defendant's crimes to be extremely brutal and sentenced him to death on April 17th. The execution has now been approved by an order from the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>Three wills, sweat pouring</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Military Tribunal Prosecutor Fu Shude, accompanied by clerk Yuan Juqing, translator Luo Di, and others, arrived at the Shanghai Prison. At 9:53, the Japanese prisoner was brought out from the prison. Tomita Toku was wearing an old yellow military uniform, and the collar insignia, etc. had been removed. He was small in stature and knew that his death was near, his face was pale. After the prosecutor asked his year and place of origin, he asked if he had any last words, and then requested to write three wills. He immediately wrote with a pencil, his heart was flustered, the pencil lead broke repeatedly, sweat poured out like pulp. When writing the third letter, he asked for a cigarette. The wording of the wills was quite absurd: (1) To the leaders and men of the Kiangwan Detention Camp: My fate will end on the morning of August 14th. I entrust my affairs to Maruyama, Noguchi, and Morishita. I wish you all good health. I wish the Imperial Army will be rebuilt and live forever. (2) Dear Wife: My fate ends today. My heart is at peace. I believe my children will follow my spirit and be reborn. My soul will always be around my mother. I hope you will uphold Japanese womanly virtues and take care of my mother. Paper is short, and my words are not exhaustive. (3) Mother, your son is unfilial, please forgive me. I am being executed today as a soldier of the Japanese Empire. Only the Emperor and the gods know my affairs. Please do not be sad and take care of your health. This paper also left a place name: Miwa Village, Chita District, Aichi Prefecture.</p>
<p>A loud bang, instantly dead</p>
<p>After writing, the prosecutor ordered the execution. At this time, Tomita was sweating profusely. The soldiers standing beside him used a towel to wipe it dry for him. His hands were tied behind his back with hemp rope, and he was taken to the execution ground. As the criminal sat on the wooden chair, he shouted "Tenno Heika Banzai" in a trembling voice. The squad leader of the military police, Ma Yushan, raised his gun, and with a loud bang, the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his mouth, blood flowed like a fountain, and he died instantly. The time was exactly 10:20 am. The corpse was covered with white cloth and taken away by Matsuoka Seiaki, on behalf of the Japanese Association.</p>
<p>After the execution of Tomita Toku, there is still one war criminal sentenced to death, Hanahana Taisai Hirata Shibasaburo, detained at the Shanghai Prison, whose ultimate fate is probably not far away.</p>

<h3>Friends of Chinese Farmers, Christian Brotherhood Group Holds Second Annual Meeting in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Yong Yusheng, Hangzhou, 13th] Thirty-eight agricultural technology experts from the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) held a meeting in Hangzhou starting on August 12th. These thirty-eight agricultural technology experts are all members of the American Christian Brotherhood. They do not want the remuneration from UNRRA and the CNRRA (Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), purely serving China's vast rural areas on a voluntary basis. Moreover, they also donate tractors, dairy cows, fertilizer, seeds, and insecticides from the United States. They truly delve into the rural areas, distributed in provinces such as Northeast China, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Although they are agricultural technology experts, they are not elegantly dressed and solemn. During the meeting, they still wore undershirts or shirts without ties, and some were barefoot, wearing shorts.</p>
<p>Full beard and no time to shave</p>
<p>Ages of twenty or thirty, but their beards are as long as Yu Youren's. The reporter was interested in their lack of grooming, and they said almost in unison: "We come from the fields, we work all day, we don't need to groom ourselves at all, and there is no time to groom ourselves, just like Chinese farmers."</p>
<p>At the meeting, only Sullienbazger, executive secretary of the Brotherhood Service Group and chairman of this year's meeting, smoked cigarettes, and none of the other agricultural experts smoked. At the opening ceremony on the 12th, only Sun Xiaolou, director of the Zhejiang branch of the CNRRA, and Zhang Zhongying, director of the inspection office, wore ties and neat clothes, which caused them to laugh. Sun and Zhang were a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>They have held a meeting in China once before, which was held in Hankou in January last year. This is already the second time. This kind of gathering is called the annual meeting, to review the achievements of serving in China and how to develop work in the future?</p>
<p>Sun Xiaolou, Director of the Zhejiang Branch of the CNRRA said: "Most of the Chinese people are lovely, and I want them to be closer to the farmers, so that they can seek the true will of the people." Sun Zhongying said: "China is too far away from agricultural modernization, and scientific methods must be used to improve agricultural production technology." Morgan, an agricultural expert stationed in Hangzhou at UNRRA said: "We thank the Brotherhood for their help, but we hope that they can further assist us in our work." Green, chairman of the Agricultural Rehabilitation Committee of the UNRRA Mountain Country Office, said: "I went to Henan last August, just after the big flood. Hundreds of thousands of acres of wasteland, the residents fled one after another, and there was no one in sight. It was really a barren land. I went to Henan again this July and saw that the land had been reclaimed and the seeds had been sown. This barren land has become cultivated land. This was originally done by hundreds of thousands of farmers, working hard by themselves. From this, we can see the greatness of the power of Chinese farmers and the strength of their will. When we technicians are in the wasteland, even if we have a tractor, I am afraid we will have to sigh at the land, and Chinese farmers can not be afraid of difficulties and hardships. This is really what our American people should admire. If they are given machinery within three years, then the Chinese people can cultivate the land all over the world." He believes that today's Chinese rural system does not need revolution, but technical improvement. He hopes that the brothers of the Brotherhood will work hard to help Chinese agricultural technology achieve modernization.</p>
<p>The agricultural technology experts of the Brotherhood are burying themselves in research to help</p>
<p>Chinese agricultural technology modernization</p>
<p>It is said that the topic of this annual meeting is to make tractors widely used in Chinese rural areas in the first step, and to make rural areas no longer use manpower to pump water in the second step, but to use machine pumping methods to irrigate fields. The third step is to enable China to manufacture fertilizer and keep seeds well preserved. As for the improvement of agricultural implements in rural areas, agricultural implement companies jointly established by the UNRRA and local officials and civilians manufacture and apply them. After the end of the UNRRA, the brothers of the Brotherhood will still stay in China for a certain period of time to help improve agricultural techniques.</p>
<p>Most of them are American experts in agricultural research, and these experts have not become officials, nor have they sat in offices to plan "actions" exclusively. They also don't spend their days attending cocktail parties and grand banquets, nor do they give touching speeches in elegant attire at public gatherings. However, they work side by side with farmers, and they can be said to be true experts. I hope that those of us in China who study agriculture will quickly delve into the countryside and take the American Brotherhood as a good example!</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The "Brotherhood Service Group," which volunteers in the UNRRA, held a meeting in Hangzhou on the 12th. Cleveland, the Director of the Chinese Branch of the UNRRA, sent a telegram praising the group's spirit of work and its actual achievements. The members come from twelve provinces, using 3,590 head of livestock and 1,136 tractors, cultivated 400,000 mu of wasteland in one year, and trained 1,000 farmers who can use new farming tools.</p>
<h3>Qingdao Zhang Lingyun Arrested, Police Bureau Issues Mimeographed Statement, All News Industry Colleagues in the City Continue to Negotiate</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Qingdao, 10th] The news of the arrest of Zhang Lingyun, president of the New Life Society in this city, has been published in this newspaper. Zhang was arrested by four plainclothes police officers at 1:00 AM on June 1st. They did not show identification or orders, saying "You don't need to worry about it," and used guns to escort him onto a large truck. His wife came out to stop them and was also threatened with guns, like a kidnapping. This has aroused the public outrage of the entire journalism community. As of last night, it has been four days. The police bureau suddenly issued a mimeographed statement, which read: "Zhang Lingyun, president of the New Life Society at No. 2 Shanghai Road in this city, served as the political instructor of the Communist Bandit 5th Detachment (Lin Ruiwu's Unit) in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), using the alias Ding Guang. In the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), he surrendered to the puppet regime and served as the head of the Propaganda Class of the New People's Association of the Puppet Regime in County, and as a special correspondent for the Puppet New People's Daily. This has been confirmed by the Ludong Anti-Japanese Comrades Friendship Association and the County Government of County. This bureau has been ordered by the superiors to carry out the investigation and arrest, and on the morning of the 6th of this month, we arrested Zhang Lingyun and transferred him to the court for trial in accordance with the law today (9th)." At 10:00 PM tonight, a mimeographed statement supplement was issued, the original text of which read: "Investigating special criminal cases is complicated and intricate, and investigation takes time. There are clear provisions in the law that they cannot be subject to the 24-hour detention like ordinary cases. After the Zhang case occurred, outsiders did not understand the truth, and even fabricated stories, saying that this bureau inflicted physical punishment, which has been denied by Mr. Zhang himself and can be said to be self-defeating. In short, this bureau acts impartially and only follows the law."</p>
<p>The newspaper industry has many doubts about this statement: Why is cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan in the 27th year (1938) now considered a crime, especially since Zhang did not join the Communist Bandit? As for traitor cases, they should be handled by the court, and according to the Special Criminal Procedure Regulations, there is no article that states "not subject to 24-hour detention." That night, after inquiring with the court, the Zhang case had not been transferred to the court, and Zhang had not been questioned at all during the four days he was detained. The newspaper industry has expressed dissatisfaction with all these points. In particular, the Military-Civilian Daily and the Qingdao Daily have protested the most vigorously.</p>
<p>All newspapers in the city have unanimously stated that if negotiations are ineffective, they will not hesitate to use a city-wide newspaper strike to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the police bureau armed Zhang and escorted him to the garrison headquarters. The garrison department also received this secret report and conducted an investigation, and all the details were false and not accepted. The police bureau has now become a situation where it is riding a tiger and cannot get off. As of press time, Zhang is still being held at the police station.</p>

<h3>Chief of Staff Li of the 74th Division Talks About the Story of Subordinates' False Surrender</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] After visiting Division Commander Qiu in County, he also introduced Chief of Staff General Li Renjun to meet the reporter. General Li was an old cadre of the 74th Division. He was not tall. He was a quiet staff officer. After a brief greeting with the reporter, he happily told the reporter: "In the Battle of Tengxian, officers and soldiers of the 74th Division who were captured in Menglianggu</p>
<p>Those who came to this division with their guns number over a thousand." This excellent news was truly an unexpected gain for the reporter. The reporter asked, "How did they act?" Chief of Staff Li said: "According to a soldier who returned, they were collectively captured by the Communist Bandit in a dead corner of Menglianggu. Under the circumstances at the time, death was imminent if they did not surrender. In order to preserve the vitality of the 74th Division, a company commander secretly informed us that we should temporarily pretend to 'surrender'. Furthermore, after being captured, they originally monitored us extremely closely, but later, due to our clever words and flattery, we deceived the bandit army and returned our guns and ammunition, ordering us to 'fight' with the bandit army. In fact, we have secretly maintained unity at all times. He has forced us to the front line several times. How can we bear to fight our own people? When the bandit army left us, we naturally fired into the sky, but sometimes we couldn't do that. In this Battle of Tengxian, the main force of the Communist Bandit was largely transferred here for reinforcements. In order to avenge the martyrs of the 74th Division and to quell the bandit rebellion, we could no longer endure it. On a dark night, the machine guns were turned around and the muzzles were turned towards the bandit camp. We planned to kill the thieves. We planned to withdraw. This is how we mixed and killed for five hours. By the time the bandit army knew to pursue, we had already retreated into a safe area and made contact with the National Army. This sacred false 'surrender' can achieve such a strategic effect, which is rare." (Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)</p>

The corpse meat was cut into pieces and devoured by the shaving team. Afterwards, only a head and both feet were left of Zhang Yandong. Previously, the provincial government, seeing that the custom of fighting in the province was very popular, was deeply afraid that local bullies would use this as a basis for separatism, and specially ordered all counties: All strong men who participated in the fighting will be drafted into military service. In addition to sending a telegram from the chief of police and security to the first battalion stationed in the local area to rush to put out the fire, Director Gong Jianxun went to deal with it in person on the 2nd of this month. When he arrived in the area, it was as if he had entered a battlefield. Traffic was cut off and bullets rained down. Gong thought that solving it by force would inevitably lead to more bloodshed, so he found Zhang Yuzhong in Xigang and Luo Ziqiang in Meixi, and formulated a three-chapter law: (1) All military weapons on both sides must be reported and handed over before the 14th of this month. (2) From now on, both sides will stop fighting and restore normal public security. (3) Those who kill will die, and the principals Luo Da Wan and others must be handed over.

<h3>First Tennis League Schedule for Two Weeks Announced; Regulations for Changing Dates and Rescheduling Matches Agreed Upon.</h3>
<p>The Tennis Committee of the Shanghai Sports Association held a joint meeting of representatives from various league teams yesterday at the Kangle Restaurant. In addition to committee members Cheng Yize, Guo Qida, Rong Deqi, Zhang Zizhen, Zhao Minheng, etc., representatives from Green Light Gao Zhenchuan, Hou Danian (represented by Wang Nanchen), Railway Fan Zishan, Li Limin, Shanghai Pan Youyuan, Wang Wenzheng, Shanghai Sports Games Sha Peng, Li Guofan, Mei Lu Hu Yunlai, Enpai Zhang Rongcai (represented by Zhang Zizhen), Chen Bo, Lianghua Xie Zhaoliang, Xie Shandi, Jinlan Yu Zhizhong, Youlian Zhang Qianheng, Central Ding Shunbao, and Lianmei Yu Tianguang attended. Zhou Jiaqi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sports Association, was present as an observer, and the meeting was chaired by Zhao Minheng, with Jiang Huaiqing as the recorder. The chairman first reported on the purpose of organizing the league and expressed gratitude for the enthusiastic participation of the teams. After discussing various issues, the following points were agreed upon:</p>
<p>Resolutions by Team Representatives</p>
<p>(1) Based on the league schedule, each group was to play three sets. Someone proposed that the number of sets be reduced to two due to insufficient court availability and time. After discussion, the majority voted to maintain the three-set system, with all matches starting at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>(2) Sha Peng of the Sports Games team proposed that, according to tennis rules, there should be no draws. The current rule of stopping the third set at 6-6 and counting it as half a point for each side is inappropriate and should be resolved by public vote. It was resolved that the third set would be played until one side reaches six games.</p>
<p>(3) Due to court constraints, the five groups cannot play simultaneously. It was resolved that if only two courts are available, Groups 1 and 2 should play first, and both teams must arrive by 4:15 PM at the latest. If three courts are available, Groups 1, 2, and 3 should play first. The same time limit applies. However, this does not apply if both parties agree to start Groups 4 and 5 earlier.</p>
<p>(4) The regulations stipulate four types of balls. Someone proposed increasing the types of balls. It was resolved that there are many types of tennis balls and it is impossible to list them all. Any brand of ball that is airtight can be used. The home team should provide five cans of new balls for each match.</p>
<p>In addition, Chairman Zhao Minheng announced that if it is absolutely necessary to reschedule a match according to the schedule, both parties may agree to do so, but there is a limit to the rescheduling. Matches scheduled for Sunday should be rescheduled for Monday or Tuesday, and matches scheduled for Wednesday should be rescheduled for Thursday, Friday, or Saturday to avoid affecting the next schedule.</p>
<p>Regarding prizes, in addition to what is stipulated in the regulations, the committee decided to award an honorary prize to any group whose members have not changed and have never lost a set in the three-set, two-win system.</p>
<p>The schedules for the first and second weeks are as follows:</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Expenditure for the 37th Year Estimated to Require Approximately 300 Billion; The Municipal Education Bureau is Preparing the Budget.</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] With the Municipal Council meeting approaching, various bureaus and departments of the municipal government are preparing the budget for the 37th year. Commodity prices have soared several times in recent months, and future conditions are unpredictable, making budget preparation quite difficult. In general, there are increases compared to this year, and the budget for education expenditure for the 37th year is expected to reach approximately 300 billion yuan, with national education expenditure accounting for the largest share. Various departments of the Municipal Education Bureau are rushing to compile this budget, which will be reported to the municipal government by the bureau next week.</p>
<p>According to Director Li Diao of the Education Bureau, who told reporters yesterday: The total expenditure on education this year is 62 billion yuan so far. With the adjustment of civil servant salaries starting in August, expenditure has increased. It is estimated that the total education expenditure will not exceed 100 billion yuan by the end of the year.</p>

<h3>Striving for International Markets and Promoting Foreign Trade: China Trust Buys Tung Oil and Bristles; Merchants Present Opinions, Hoping the Authorities Will Improve.</h3>
<p>Since the Central Trust Bureau began acting as the government's agent for purchasing export goods, its implementation has been extremely smooth. To date, it has reached a total of 5,000 tons of tung oil, including 2,000 tons purchased in this city and approximately 2,000 tons purchased in Changsha, Hankou, Chongqing, and other places. Within the 5,000 tons, the Zhongzhi Oil Factory alone accounts for 1,970 tons, including 870 tons in this city, 450 tons in Hankou, 100 tons in Chongqing, 250 tons in Wuzhou, and 200 tons in Guangzhou. To promote the government subsidy system, the China Trust Bureau hands over the purchased goods to merchants for export and sale. To strive for the European market, it has sold 1,000 tons to the UK and various parts of mainland Europe at a price of 177 pounds per ton. It is currently observing the US market due to price concerns. However, according to the opinions of tung oil manufacturers: (1) The current purchase price of 630,000 yuan per shi is considered too low. After selling, it is impossible to replenish from the producing areas. Because merchants still have to pay interest, exchange water, transportation, and leakage expenses, a reasonable price should be above 700,000 yuan per shi. (2) The full payment date, which is no less than one week, is also too slow. Time is a significant cost for merchants, and it is hoped that the bureau will consider shortening it. (3) The reason for the slow export of purchased goods is that the price is slightly higher, making promotion difficult. If the authorities adopt market prices and make adjustments, overseas sales could be revitalized. The method for purchasing hog bristles has also changed. It is understood that in the past, the bristles were purchased from bristle merchants, and then exporters would sell them abroad on consignment. Now, it has been changed to exporters selling abroad first, and then purchasing. The bristle industry has no objection to supporting the government's policy. However, (1) the 2% commission fee is considered too low. Because exporters have to pay a 2% commission fee when selling in overseas markets, their own expenses for telegrams, paper, and labor are not covered, so they request an increase in the commission fee to 4% to avoid losses. (2) Overseas prices fluctuate from time to time. The export price set by the Central Trust Bureau also has to be decided after a meeting, which often cannot cope with the changes in overseas markets. If there is a downward trend in overseas markets, it is impossible to close the deal after the meeting. It is recommended to adopt a flexible approach to avoid missing opportunities. (3) The price for purchasing is returned and delayed, and it takes more than ten days to receive the money, which should also be improved. (4) Purchasing is a national policy, and it is difficult for the Central Trust Bureau to handle this heavy task alone. Other institutions should be designated to handle it at the same time according to the regulations. The bristle industry believes that the above points are of great importance to international trade and hopes that the government will consider them.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Representatives Went to Beijing Yesterday to Request a Reduction in the Price of Rayon Allocation; No One Applied for Goods Allocated by China Trust Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, and other representatives from the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association, a total of 16 people, went to Beijing by car in two batches yesterday to request a reduction in the price of rayon allocation and to improve the allocation method. It is said that they will petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other agencies.</p>
<p>Another report: According to Cai and Liu before their departure yesterday, after Mayor Wu intervened in the mediation, the Central Trust Bureau has agreed to reduce the new allocation price by 20%, and is now asking the Executive Yuan for instructions. However, Mayor Wu proposed to allocate silk at a ratio of 7 for black market price and 5 for allocation price, that is, to sell at 70% of the new allocation price. As for their mission to petition in Beijing, it is to ask the authorities to improve the silk allocation method and set up a silk allocation committee, among four other demands.</p>
<p>Another report: It is learned that the Central Trust Bureau's agency for selling rayon for the weaving belt industry held its 19th allocation yesterday, but no one from the industry went to apply for purchase.

<p>It is also reported that the purchase of new tea under the tea loan program was originally stipulated by the Four Banks Joint Office, and the loans were issued through the Farmers Bank of China. Therefore, it has been decided to invite the Four Banks Joint Office and the Farmers Bank of China to participate in the acquisition of new tea to ensure that tea loans and acquisition procedures are linked.</p>
<p>Stabilization of the Tea Market</p>
<p>Recently, the domestic sales of tea have finally tended to move, but lack integration. The process is not lively, but people's hearts are still eager to stabilize. As for prices, because the quality of goods varies more than before, there have been changes in each category, but in reality, it is still in a state of stalemate. As for the foreign trade tea market, the situation of quietness for many days has not yet been broken. Because a month ago, the French company Yongxing Yanghang finalized a deal with Morocco for 900 tons of Zhenmei tea, the local export merchants are now busy with shipping as the shipping date is approaching, and they have no time to take care of other matters. It is learned that the French company Yongxing Yanghang plans to continue to promote green tea such as Zhenmei in that area, and it is said that they will soon send a telegram overseas to solicit business.</p>
<h3>Silk Spinning Team Decides to Adjust Price Negotiation for 20-Count Yarn to 9.7 Million Yuan Per Piece</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Silk Spinning Price Negotiation Team convened a meeting yesterday afternoon. As a result, it was decided to adjust the price negotiation for 20-count yarn to 9.7 million yuan per piece, an increase of 200,000 yuan compared to Monday's negotiation. The price negotiations for other counts of yarn remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Continued Firmness of Yarn Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to show an upward trend, with the market prices having fallen significantly for days, and buyers taking advantage of the low prices to make purchases. There were also movements in the local market, with rumors of favorable buying circulating in the market.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn continued to rise by 760,000 yuan from the previous day, to 16.8 million yuan. 20-count Extra Double Horse yarn rose sharply to 11.5 million yuan, and Light Double Horse also rose to 10.2 million yuan, both up 500,000 yuan. 16-count Coarse Yarn Guangming also rose by 550,000, to 9.1 million yuan, and Hailong rose by 500,000, to 8.4 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn all continued to rise by varying amounts, ranging from 100,000 to 450,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Slight Increase in Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw scattered sellers offering goods. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once fell to a low of 395,000 yuan. However, due to large buyers taking advantage of the low prices to absorb supply, and various parties also making moves, about 100 pieces were traded. It was also rumored that the Hong Kong dollar was depreciating, and floating capital might shift to the Shanghai market, causing buying sentiment in the market to become even stronger. Due to insufficient stock, Dragon Head fine cloth slightly rose from a low price to 424,000 yuan, and then there was some profit-taking and selling, pulling the price back slightly, and finally closed at 410,000 yuan, a continued increase of 5,000 yuan from the previous day. After the close, the outside market price was as high as 415,000 yuan, with buyers still interested.</p>
<p>Fine cloths of various grades, such as Wufu, Caiqiu, Lanji, Yanghe, and Zhenzhong, also rose by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. The remaining white fabric, bleached fabric, and yuan fabric, fine twill, Shilin cloth, and other popular items rose by 3,000 to 20,000 yuan. Straight tribute silk, yuan twill, blue cloth, and coarse cloth showed a fluctuating trend.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Cloth</p>
<p>It is also reported that China Textile Construction Corporation sold cloth as usual yesterday. As the yarn and cloth market turned popular, the number of applicants was very enthusiastic. As a result, a total of 28,600 bolts of cloth were sold, with a total of 884 applications, including 16 domestic manufacturers, purchasing 640 bolts of cloth, and 868 cloth merchants purchasing 27,960 bolts of cloth.</p>
<h3>Continued Stability of Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market turned firmer and the trend stabilized. Buyers' appetite increased due to the continued strength of cotton yarn, and local yarn factories showed considerable interest. However, as the new cotton season was approaching and new goods were expected to flood the market, sellers were unwilling to raise prices, and many transactions were shelved. The prices offered by various firms for delivery to factories were: Baoer 2.05 million, Shashi 1.98 million, Hankou fine velvet 1.94 million, Lingbao, delivered at the pier, 2 million, 2.02 million, Zhoupu seed cotton 290,000.</p>
<h3>Liquidation Work of Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Li Lixia, Chief of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, answered four questions from reporters yesterday, which are recorded as follows: (1) The liquidation of Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks is currently proceeding smoothly and will be completed in the short term. (2) The Shanghai branches of the two banks have had their licenses revoked by the Ministry of Finance, so there is no hope of resumption of business. (3) The National Bank's inspection of the general operations of banks and firms continues as usual. If any abnormal operations are found, they will be immediately reported to the Ministry of Finance for handling. The results will only be announced after the Ministry of Finance decides on the handling methods. (4) The recent easing of credit is likely a natural cycle following the previous tight credit conditions and is unrelated to the management of general banking obligations. The recent clearing of checks is quite normal, which is sufficient to prove that the financial sector is quite peaceful.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation, Nine Years of Peaceful Coexistence, Sudden Discord and Legal Battle</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have lived in a living room in a certain alley for nine years with the sub-landlord Mr. Yuan. Recently, I was suddenly sued in court by him for "business needs" and the reason of increased population, requesting me to move out and asking for permission to execute the order. Now I have several questions and hope to get your answers. (1) Mr. Yuan's family has a total of six people, living in eight rooms of the house. In fact, the space is quite spacious. Can the house be taken back on the grounds of "business needs?" (2) Mr. Yuan now reports a total of fifteen people including his collateral relatives. Can this be a legitimate reason for taking back the house? (3) Mr. Yuan has repeatedly increased the rent, and I have not been able to afford it, so he has harbored resentment. Now he is forcing me to move out. Is this also the main reason? Is this reasonable in law? (4) Now I am unable to move out and refuse Mr. Yuan's request. What legal protection do I have? Sincerely, Sun Siru</p>
<p>[Attorney He Kuang] (1) Whether the number of his family members is large and whether the eight rooms they occupy are insufficient can be proved by asking the court to access the household registration book of the household. (2) Whether his collateral relatives have moved in can also be ascertained from the household registration book. (3) Forcing a tenant to move out because of failure to increase the rent is unjustified. (4) If the tenant has not violated any of the provisions listed in Article 100 of the Land Law, the landlord shall not claim to take back the house without reason.</p>

<h3>Reading "Philosophy of the New World"</h3>
<p>— Meng Kun</p>
<p>Written by Zhang Xinyi, Published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>This recently published book discussing philosophical issues uses the most accessible method of narration, not only discussing some topics that are traditionally considered to belong to the realm of philosophy, but also involving many other social, natural, life, living, and cosmic, international aspects. As the title of the book suggests, this is a book studying the philosophy of the "New World," so the author, from his point of view, expands philosophy into an all-encompassing program, and then analyzes the laws and systems of each "New World."</p>
<p>Living in our era, the need for knowledge is more urgent for people than in any previous historical period. Philosophy, which was originally the study of a few specialized talents, is now of concern to the general public. Our publishing industry has also published many philosophical books in the past, but they are all academic classics for scholars to seek truth, and are not used to help the general public understand the truth of this world. This book provides some common-sense philosophical knowledge, which is practical and indispensable for people who are citizens of a new world.</p>
<p>This book may be considered a practical philosophy, but it is still distant from the so-called philosophy of life in the secular sense. Its scope is broader, touching on every abstract question that exists in a century. Rather than saying that this book is an introduction to philosophical common sense, it is better to say that it is an introduction to the common sense of the era. It gives readers a clear world view and social view. From a browse of this book, we can see how we human beings live in this time and space, and how we will live on. Understanding what the era is, what major problems our era has, we then understand what kind of life criteria individuals should adopt, go to the future, build a new culture, and create a new civilization.</p>
<p>The entire article is about 150,000 words in length, divided into two parts. The first part, "Ethical System," focuses on some basic concepts and basic principles of life; the second part, "Deduction and Problems," is an extension of the first part, moving from abstract to concrete, discussing various actual and complex problems.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the first part proposes the basic responsibility of our era, which is how to eliminate human suffering and further cultivate the flowers and fruits of happiness. The author uses the painful memories of World War II as a warning and shouts out the slogan of "transforming thought." Although this has some preaching flavor, it can be seen that the author is a sincere admirer of humanism and not a whimsical figure, combined with the author's utilitarianism and some of the aspirations for social reconstruction in the final paragraph. Based on this premise, the author's thoughts spread out, and after revealing the root of the world's chaos, he then discusses issues such as "the universe and events," "categories and causes," "purpose and means," and "this virtue." After this, there are four chapters arranged side by side, first discussing people's good and bad, the value of life, happiness, and happiness; then discussing the good and bad of the public, thus contrasting the importance and relationship between people and society; then discussing the question of right and wrong, what is truth, what is objective absolute right and wrong; and finally discussing good and evil, criticizing a person's behavior and knowledge; these discussions all lead to the wellspring of morality, and integrate the ethical theories of various schools of thought in China and the West.</p>
<p>The following section then discusses some of the "biggest and most fundamental" practical problems based on the above theory. The first is the outlook on life, "People are born into the world to work together to turn our universe into the best universe"; the outlook on work, "Any profession is to be loyal to one's duty in the universe"; the other is to say that the spirit of the era lies in moving from the pursuit of the welfare of a few to the pursuit of the welfare of the majority. Finally, seven major problems in the world are extracted: the first is the national view, the author praises universal love, hopes for great harmony, sings the praises of righteous diplomacy, and dreams of abolishing the colonial system. The second is the economic view, discussing material enjoyment and the distribution of enjoyment, but also discussing the population problem. The third discusses democracy, the fourth discusses moral issues. The fifth discusses religion, the sixth discusses philosophy, and the seventh discusses science. He very rationally and freely reveals his faith in the new world.</p>
<p>Overall, this book is very accessible in form and very practical in content. The author widely adopts the existing theories of various scholars, but it is not boring. Not many technical terms are used, the explanations are thorough, the sentences are simple, and examples are abundant. At the same time, it adopts a new organization, appropriately interweaving the original philosophical life problems with the new world dynamics, without seeing any patchworks. Furthermore, the author takes every problem that fits the daily life of modern human beings as his object. Every problem is closely related to our existence in this world. Once we accept them, we will see more clearly the time and space in which we are located.</p>
<h3>The Little Dough Man Seeks Immortality</h3>
<p>— Jie Hang</p>
<p>(Published by Hope Society)</p>
<p>"The Little Dough Man Seeks Immortality," purely from the perspective of the book itself, is not a bad one. However, from the perspective of the author's ambition, or the purpose that the author himself hopes for, it is not the best book. The author says at the beginning of the book that it is given to "my little daughter who is far away from me and all the children who are far away from their parents." What the book describes is the various difficulties encountered by the Little Dough Man on his journey to seek immortality in order to truly become a person. Therefore, the sequel to this book should not be the young masters and young ladies who are causing trouble in the ivory tower because they have eaten too much milk and have indigestion, but rather those children who are going to suffer the misfortune of being "far away from their parents." However, there are many images and words in this book that these children cannot understand, which may be what should be criticized. Like: "It seems that someone is gently pulling the Huai E-ling," "walking with Chaplin-like steps," "By-By By-By," and "Ha". Can those "children who are far away from their parents" know what "Huai E-ling," "Chaplin," "By-By," and "Ha" are? These places should be replaced with more accessible images and words. For example, "Happy as if he got a hundred points" This "as if" is very inappropriate, because we no longer need to cultivate the concept of children regarding scores as life.</p>
<p>In addition, the author has neglected one point. The four dangers encountered by the Little Dough Man, except for the fox, do not have detailed character descriptions. However, the author's description of the rabbit is very successfully original: the rabbit dreams that the Lion King said to him, "You have two long ears, you should hear everything... It doesn't matter if you move a little bit of right and wrong." It is different from the imitation of old fairy tales by the fox, dog, and scorpion. Originality is especially important in China, where there are few children's books.</p>
<p>The good things about this book should be the following points:</p>
<p>The first is in terms of the technique of giving metaphors. Like the dog said to the Little Dough Man:</p>
<p>"Welcome to my door</p>
<p>(It points to its mouth),</p>
<p>Come to my house and rest your legs,</p>
<p>(It patted its belly)."</p>
<p>Using this form is clearer and easier for young readers to accept.</p>
<p>The second is that the innocence of the Little Dough Man is expressed very successfully in the dialogue without using an adjective. Like the Little Dough Man said:</p>
<p>"Why are you drooling and staring at me? The book is not shy!" "Oh, oh, oh, I'm going to cry!"</p>
<p>Third, the fragrant knots of this fairy tale poem have reached the highest level, harmonious and natural.</p>
<p>In short, although this book is mixed with cleverness and clumsiness, it is still a children's book that can be read in China today.</p>
<h3>Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Zong Hao</p>
<p>Edited by Ren Jiayao, Published by Dongfang Bookstore</p>
<p>In recent years, the changes in domestic personnel have been numerous and complicated, often making it difficult for people to find out the key. Especially in the process of the eight years of the War of Resistance and the two years of victory and restoration, the overall situation has been turbulent and unstable, and personnel changes have been ever-changing. If you want to understand the current affairs, you must start with these numerous news figures.</p>
<p>In China's pitiful publishing industry, it seems that no one has started editing a dictionary of contemporary Chinese celebrities in the past decade. For newspaper readers, to "know people and discuss things" and explore the cause and effect of facts from the ideological background of the parties involved, it is very difficult because of the lack of such dictionaries, and it is extremely painful for young people who are eager to learn.</p>
<p>Now, the "Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Celebrities" edited by Ren Jiayao has been published. Although it cannot be said to be all-encompassing and describe the life of every important person in the country in detail, it does have a clear and concise outline, allowing readers to have a general understanding of figures in the political, military, industrial, academic and other fields in the country. It lets people know the year of birth, native place, alias, background, experience, works, current position and other main items of each contemporary person. The order of arrangement is based on the number of strokes in the name, making it quite convenient to check.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole book, its final revision should be the stage when the government was reorganized, so the backbone of the Youth Party of China and the Democratic Socialist Party of China were also added. The book contains about 1,500 to 1,600 celebrities. In terms of quantity, it is indeed not complete and detailed enough, and because of the lack of photos, it is not eye-catching to read. However, if we treat it as a reference for reading newspapers and use it as a basis for understanding news and "knowing people and discussing things," it is still a reference book with considerable value and content.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Biological Evolution</h3>
<p>— Dongyuan</p>
<p>(Written by Zhou Jianren, Life Edition, Price: 7,000 Yuan)</p>
<p>Living things are evolving. According to V. Kellogg's explanation of the meaning of "evolution":</p>
<p>"Evolution means continuity, transformation, from the old arising the new; it is change, continuous movement, and gradual development. It means a system of interrelationship, affinity of lineage, a comprehensive system encompassing all living things. It means the fundamental unity of all living things, yet the appearances and behaviors of each kind and each individual vary. Evolution is a continuous stream of life, expressed differently in different parts, but actually never cut off."</p>
<p>Indeed, "evolution is a continuous stream of life," and humanity has unfolded a fierce struggle for progress on this path!</p>
<p>In recent years, several translations of works on "evolutionary theory" have been published, but their difficult language makes them inaccessible to the general public, such as Darwin's "The Origin of Species." Consequently, many intellectuals, although aware of the word "evolution," remain unclear about its true meaning.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Jianren's recent book, "A Brief Discussion of Biological Evolution," fills the above gap. This is an original work, and its writing does not have the dry and difficult tone of translated works. Instead, it is accessible to the average reader.</p>
<p>The author's tone in this book is more popular and concise than in his other works, because it is aimed at the general youth—for young people to use for self-study. In terms of content, it provides an overview of the theory of biological evolution.</p>
<p>First, he explains what is meant by "evolution"? He clearly states the meaning of "evolution," and objectively describes the different translations of "evolution" by different schools.</p>
<p>Next, he discusses the richness of the biological world, the connections within the biological world, the development of organisms, and their changes and the "causes" of these changes. These aspects are described concisely and accurately. After reading, one will definitely have a general understanding of the evolution and transformation of organisms.</p>
<p>Later, the author also explains instinct and its origin, the origin of mankind, and language and writing. From ancient times to the present, the author presents it all clearly in a concise style.</p>
<p>After reading these articles, one can understand the various meanings of biological evolution, especially for young people, who can add a lot of necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this book is of a sufficient standard, especially since this type of book is hard to find in the publishing industry. It is also a contribution to the publishing industry.</p>
<h3>On New Art</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>Written by Cai Yi, Published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>This kind of book is one that solves the question of "What is art?" This "On New Art" is no exception.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into eight chapters, totaling 192 pages, and is in a 32mo format. It was first published in Chongqing in July of the 32nd year, reprinted in December of the following year, and first published in Shanghai in the 35th year. Recently, it has been included in the "Middle School Student's Library."</p>
<p>In the first chapter, "Introduction," the relationship between art and reality and science is explained. The differences between art and science in terms of understanding are distinguished. The understanding of art is sensory, and the understanding of science is intellectual. The former is figurative, and the latter is logical. The author also affirms: art is the expression of the recognition of reality, and this expression requires skilled technique, but not technique acquired through repeated identical or similar behaviors. Rather, it requires, as a prerequisite, the ability to express the essence of reality, to recognize typical images.</p>
<p>Recognition is the beginning of artistic creation, and completion is expression. The second and third chapters examine this aspect in detail. First, from the two major divisions of philosophy—idealism and materialism—it is explained what constitutes recognition. The author affirms: "Sensation is the basis of recognition, and the external objects of reality are the source of sensation, and without external objects of reality, there is no consciousness at all, and all recognition is a reflection of reality." (p. 29) And art is an expression of recognition. He opposes theories of inspiration and theories of genius, asserting: "Art is not a revelation of the subconscious, nor is it the result of fantasy, that is to say, it is not beyond reality, not isolated from reality, but a reflection of objective reality, that is, an understanding of objective reality by the author." (p. 32) What is the nature of recognition? It is mainly to reflect the general in the particular of objective reality through intellect and then return to the senses. At the same time, practice is the trigger for the author's recognition of objective reality, and it must also be a dynamic and conscious recognition. The content of artistic recognition is the image that reflects the general in the particular of objective reality, which is the typical creation of art.</p>
<p>So-called expression is the tracing of recognition, and recognition can also be said to be the source of expression. But in examining the relationship between artistic expression and propaganda, in terms of the author and the work: it is the expression of self-recognition, the creation of self-completion. In terms of society: it is the communication to others; the former is the artistic quality of art, and the latter is the propaganda quality of art, both of which must be based on artistic quality and unified in the completed art. The higher the artistic quality, the greater the propaganda quality; the lower the artistic quality, the smaller the propaganda quality, so artistic quality is the first priority.</p>
<p>Artistic expression requires technique, but technique cannot exist independently apart from other conditions of artistic creation. There are three main conditions for technique: first, familiarity with the constituent laws of the object of expression; second, familiarity with the influence of subjective spirit on the object; third, familiarity with the special properties of the tools of expression. The consistent relationship between these three is the supreme method of artistic expression.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter explains the content and form of art. The author believes that in art, "recognition is the content, expression is its form, the content determines the form, but the form is also an essential, dynamic element for art. It has its own uniqueness and can act on the content in turn to further demand the unity of content and form."</p>
<p>The foundation of the subjectivity of art is individuality, and from a class-based point of view, it is the class nature of consciousness; objectivity is the essence or truth of objective reality reflected through the consciousness of the author, which is the core of the content of art. Thus, objective reality has historical nature, and the art that reflects it has a sense of the times. Demanding the sense of the times in art expresses its permanence, and to pursue permanence, one must grasp the sense of the times.</p>
<p>Art is the expression of the recognition of reality, and what is expressed? It expresses the typical under the premise of related attributes—the content, form, subjectivity, objectivity, individuality, class nature, sense of the times, and permanence of art—and expression is description. The fifth and sixth chapters of this book examine these two aspects.</p>
<p>The typical is the artistic image that embodies the general in the particular, and it is also the core of art. Thus, artistic creation is the creation of the typical. To achieve the typical in art, there must be a typical in reality, but the typical in art is not a reproduction of reality or the typical reality, but an expansion and deepening of its typicality. It achieves the creation of typical characters and the grasp of typical situations. The positive and negative multifacetedness of the typical does not necessarily destroy the typicality, but can strengthen it.</p>
<p>The description of the typical should mainly appeal to the senses. This is concrete expression, while the intellectual is abstract expression. However, being too concrete can lead to triviality or failure to grasp the essentials. Furthermore, overemphasizing the expression of the subjective spirit through external images, or taking the development of the special properties of tools as the key to artistic creation—this kind of centerlessness and isolated technique is centrifugal description. The author asserts that it is not the main method of expression in art. On the contrary, centripetal description is the most reasonable and the description that creates the typical.</p>
<p>The seventh chapter, "Realism," can be said to be an examination of the path of current artistic creation. The author first explains that art of realism is the creation of artistic beauty outside of objective reality, based on idealistic philosophy. Art of realism takes objective reality as its content, and form is also determined by content, based on materialistic philosophy. Secondly, from the historical development perspective, the author examines the four stages of the development of realism, and particularly points out the fundamental differences between new realism and old realism, and further points out its creative method and world view. These two things "are inseparable, but not the same; there are differences, but not contradictions. A correct world view, applied to the field of art, can become a correct artistic thought that guides artistic creation, and a correct creative method can also help the artist's correct world view to form and develop." (p. 172)</p>
<p>Finally, the author examines the aesthetic problems of "the beauty of art and the evaluation of art" from the perspective of new realism. He asserts that the truth of art and the beauty of art are related and dependent on the typicality of art. He further points out: "Truth is concrete description. The more centripetal the description, the more the typical is based on objective reality, and the more advanced the typical, the higher the artistic quality of the work, and at the same time, the greater its propaganda quality, that is, the more it possesses the truth of art, the more it possesses the beauty of art, and the more valuable the work." (p. 192)</p>
