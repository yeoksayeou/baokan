<h3>吳鐵城談普選　民主政治須實地學習　盼各界人士樂觀合作</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅一日電〕吳鐵城今對記者闡述其對於普選之觀感稱，普選與政黨提名，皆爲巾國人初次經騐，縱然不能得到完全合理合法的結果，但經騐終是可寳貴的。</p>
<p>政黨提名，爲民主國家通例，競選爲民主國家人民正常權利。至於「選賢與能講信修睦」，如何始能做到？均可在競選中切實考騐。國人常說民主政治必須實地學習，正如游泳著總須人水學習，即是此意。如果拘泥糾紛的跡象，懷疑憲政的前途，豈非類於訕笑孩子的蹣跚學步。本黨提名，是由下而上的，縣省兩級所擬的人選，即使有欠公允處，中央尙有最後核定之權。惟以名額有限，遺珠之憾，實所難免。倘認此即爲不公，亦非平允之論。深望各界人士，對初次普選，寄以樂觀，予以合作，共同奠立憲政初基。</p>

<h3>社論　建立中國新法系</h3>
<p>中華民國法學會第四屆年會，今日在本市召開，該會理事長居司法院長將親臨主持。此一年會的召開。　全國法界優秀之士於一堂，値茲　亂建國的時候，其意　自至重大。茲於該會爲幕之日，除祝賀大會成功外，對中國新法系的建立，復　釣略有所論列：</p>
<p>第一，目今舉國動員戡亂，我們夷考亂之所由來，其中原因，固非單純，但國人之缺乏守法精神，以致有損法治之尊嚴，要亦爲主因之一。全國人民，對於國家的法律，均應絕對遵守，不容例外。在法治國家，人人均應在法律之下，絕不容許有任何所謂「超法」的行徑。我們自淸季　修現代送律以來，爲時也不可謂太短，此後如何萬行法治，關係建國大業者至鉅；我們願本　年會的召開，對於如何樹立厲行法治的良好基礎，能够有切實可行的決策。</p>
<p>第二，中國自古以來，原有本身對於法學的供獻，自成一個法系；迨至盛唐，律例嚴明，尤爲舉世所　稱。近百年來，由於與外國接觸的頻繁，我國開始接受了部分外國法律的精神，將我國的法律，予以重訂。自立法院成立以來，復又依據國父之　敎，對於我國民刑法律，重予修正；其立法精神，及立法技術之進步，世界一般法學家無不稱道。　我國的基本法律，特別在社會立法方面，尙有待於修訂者甚多，我們希望此種法律能够早日完成，俾三民主養的法系能够及時建立。</p>
<p>第三，講到司法方面，年來在物價高漲，生活動盪的局勢下，全國司法人員　的忠於職守，贏得　般的讚佩。在我國司法制度方面，由於居院長的力圖適應時代需要，亦曾不斷有所改進。將來　行憲以後，司　的尊嚴更將提高。一個法系的建立，不僅需要完善的立法　更需要開明的司法。我們　乎美國最高法院的判例，如何影　　美國法學的滋長敎育，益信司法者地位的重要。在中國新法系的建立上，我們也希　中國的司法機關　够有像英美那樣的供戲</p>
<h3>首屆商人節</h3>
<p>商人節是一個最新的節日。去年今日當全國商聯在京開會之際，與會代表認爲全國商聯會於抗戰勝利後，集會苜都，意義　大，決議以該會召開之　爲商人節。此項節日的規定，出於商　的自動，雖尙未奉國府明令核准，但商人爲其本身利益，旣　是項要求，似可與五一的工人　後先輝映　茲當首屈商人節，該抒所見，以爲勗　。</p>
<p>士農工商，古稱四民，而商人特被輕視；說他們是逐末之徒，是分利的，　是生利的。海通以來，思想似乎一變，而中間商的剝削，加重消費者的負担，這一類印像，依舊很深刻，很普徧；彷彿生產者和消費者之間，最好一切直接，不需要第三者代為　手。</p>
<p>是的，這一切第三者的轉手，確乎增加了成本，從而增加了用戶的担負。在可能範圍內，儘量地减少這些轉手，或利用各式合作社的組織，藉以减輕成本，使利權不致外溢，這是很合理的，並且很合乎潮流的適宜處置。</p>
<p>可是話又得說回來，一切商業的存在，未必全繫乎商人們片面的蘄求，而實　於多數主顧的需要。假如此項需要並不存在，或雖略有需要而爲數不多，則無論如何宣傳，招徠，裝璜，佈　，終必門可羅雀，而自吿收歇。反是，則雖在嚴刑峻法之下，經官廳百般高壓，而此起彼伏，有時仍難以消滅。這就因爲他們物質的或服務的供給，自有其不可磨滅的價値故。况　　會　　化，　分工愈細密，戰國時代的孟子已經說過：「　一人之身，而百工之所爲備，如必自爲而後用之　是率天卞而路也。」在這商品生產時代，而於農工商之間，仍要故爲　　，這當然是多餘的事了。</p>
<p>不過商業的（存在，既　於社會　需要，則對此需要如何求其適合，即如何廉其代價　高其品質，時其供應，，業　觀　，以投合　般人之所好，因以加强其所佔之地位，自是一商人們自身亟需研求的根本問題　有許多落伍的行業，不能　時度勢，迎頭趕上，以致相形見細，遭受　然的淘汰；這完全是人謀的不臧，絕不能歸咎於他人的。</p>
<p>其次，則經濟生活，原是社會形態之一部份，與其他政治，文化等部份息息相關，決不能　而爲二。大戰以後，所謂自由貿易主義，本已殘息僅存，不復為當世所注重；各國的經濟政策，政府多少帶有點干涉或管制的氣味，即以崇尙自由著稱之英美，亦尙且不免多少干涉到私人的經濟生活，何况其他？我國自去年頒行經濟緊急措施方案以來，亦已重行逐漸走上這管制一途，自本年頒佈總動員戡亂綱要，而管制的需要愈强。在這個非常時期，工商界均應正視常前的事實。俠照法令，妥愼配合，以符合國家的決策。現行一切有關法令和臨時的措置·　有許多矛盾，重複，偏頗而不合理的地方，但在未經合法修正以前，無論袖手觀望，拒不合作，或陽奉陰違，意存取巧，或竟甘　不　，違法犯禁，這都不是正常商人應有的態度。在政府，固當根據民生主義的大原則，於　訂各種管制方案時，力求顧到人民應享有的基本自由權利，且能　訪周諮，而不一意孤行。但在商人方面，當這舉步荆棘，困難重重的時候，商人們於力謀解除自身所遭遇的痛苦而外，也不可不體念國家的艱危。我們深深的同情商人的痛苦，切望常局改善管制，務從寬大，體卹商艱，培　民力，同時亦不得不望一般商人，提高服務的精利，認淸當前的局勢，愼重自處，以期減少　　不必要的糾紛。</p>
<h3>周以德談華北印象　老百姓們依然勤奮工作　困難雖重重復興仍可期</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕周以德昨天午後五時半，以北平話開始他的記者招待會。他說：「在中國居留過十年，第一年在南京，後五年在福建，以後四年在由西。所以我的巾國話帶有閩北土音。這次來華考察，原定有議員五人，分屬於遠東及外交兩個委員會，但由於十一月十日美國國會召開特別會議，討論援歐問題，其餘四位被事務留在美國。」</p>
<p>有一位記者問他對華北的印象，他的答覆很別致：「華北的通貨膨賬，交通破壞，政治低能的情形，如果是在美國的話，那眞是不得了的事，可是在中國是另外一種情形。老百姓依然是生氣勃勃忍受痛苦地工作着。一切情形比我們在美國想　的要好。因此，我想到中國目前固然是困難重重，但並不是沒有希望，只要有正確的辦法，復興還寔可期。」</p>
<p>這位一貫同情中國的友人，不願透露他未來向國會提出報吿的內容，但他坦率說明，有兩點是特別注意的；「首先，是中國政治和經濟的一般情况，因爲中國的預算百分之七十用於軍事，整個國家的資源和力量，亦消耗在戰事中。我們不得不注意到軍事情形。其次是宣傳工作，在今天，宣傳已成爲有力的武器。以前　索里尼說過：「你第一次說謊，人家是不信任的，但是如果不變地重　數百數千次，人家會由懷疑　信任了　，以後的希特勒，現在的蘇聯，都是這條原則的忠實執行者。因此今日舉世充滿有宣傳作用的謊話。</p>
<h3>兩種政策均受攻擊美國態度左右爲難</h3>
<p>舉些實例吧，如美國企圖使日本復興　美國希望控制中國，美國要發動一次對蘇戰爭，美國要扶德制蘇，這些都是只問目的不擇手段的謊話。對於歐洲，美國如果袖手不管，就有人駡我們是孤立主義，如果積極協助，就會有帝國主義者的頭銜，說來　使人啼笑皆非　在道種情形之下，我們不得不注意到宣傳問題了。打擊謊話的最好辦法是宣楊眞理　凡是對於民主自由有信仰的人，應盡力宣傳這些概念」。</p>
<p>他說，日本在五十年內，沒有復興希望，美國對日本的協助，是使日本人養得活自己，決不是要它强盛。日本前途在中國手裏，沒有中國的原料和市塲，日本根本不能維持。　談話極自然的轉到美國借款，這位議員說，這個問題他不能答覆，所能說的，美國人民均同情中國，願意盡力援助，問題是採什麼方式？他說：「至於我自己，兩年來一向建議援華，可惜在國會四百五十三名議員中，只有我一個人在大聲疾呼，沒能發生作用。現在東西兩方的大局在　變，美國在希　土西歐和聯合國大會中　都改變了政策，將來在中國亦將被迫出此」。</p>
<h3>取締民盟係屬內政周以德稱不便批評</h3>
<p>民盟的問題亦　提出，這位　　的答覆是：「民盟的某幾個人　有通共的行爲，不過這是中　的內政問題，我不便加以批評」。局以德先住態度够坦白而明朗化，他說：「在中國要多用耳朶」。我們希望他歸國之後，能多用嘴消除中美問一切誤會，實現他「中美在戰後仍當合作如戰時」的願望。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾計劃頗遇阻力　英政府深感不安　克里浦斯稱已不存奢望　塔虎脫再度抨擊杜魯門各項施策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦卅日電〕英經濟部長克里浦斯在記者招待會中稱：英國已準備在必要時因不能獲得美國之援助而自力更生，然此必綱續减少糧食配給，並再度抑低已經跌落之生活水準。渠稱：工黨政府對馬歇爾計劃與其他美國援助之可能性已不存奢望，政府所考慮者唯自治領之援助耳。克氏並稱：「我人面對事實，我人爲盡力克復我人之經濟困難，必要時準備單獨奮鬥若干年。如馬歇爾計劃不能實行，其對世界發展，特別對歐洲之發展，有何影響，殊値得我人深思。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三十日電〕巴黎洲十六國會議完成其討論馬歇爾計劃之報吿書，雖巴四星期於茲，然迄今猶無指示，可知此一援歐計劃之最後方式將屬如何，因此美國及歐洲之官員，已有漸呈不耐者。贊助援歐計劃者目前所最感不安者，爲美國政界及企業界人士，鑒於歐洲之社會主義趨勢，而反對馬歇爾計劃者之逐漸增多。參議員塔虎脫公開表示，建議的援助規模，實屬不合理，同意搭氏此項主張者，顯然已有漸增之勢。今日之「華爾街日報」亦表示援歐爲一件事，而扶助懷具破產哲學，而搖搖欲塵的若千歐洲政府，乃又一件事，顯然寓有反對援歐之意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅一日電〕共和黨總統候選人搭虎脫宣稱，國會未來特別會議時關於處理挽回物價與通貨膨脹問題一點，民主共和兩黨殆無合作希望。杜魯門政府各種政策殊欠健全，本人不能與之合作。國務卿馬歇爾與副國務卿洛維特今日曾與杜魯門總統會談，恐係謀對援歐草案作最後決定。</p>
<h3>美視綫轉向東方　伊頓重視美國援華問題</h3>

<h3>勉度左右兩派夾擊難關　法內閣獲信任票　政府採中間路綫愼防國家分裂</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎卅日電〕法國民議會對賴瑪迪採取中間道路之聯合內閣，卅一日夜投信任票，僅獲得間不容髮之多數，似此，法內閣可避免共產黨及戰時自由法國領袖載高樂所領導之反共法國人民聯盟夾攻下而趨崩潰矣。對政府之信任投票，係以三百對二百八十票（十八票棄權）之多數通過。</p>
<p>國民議會於卅日下午六時四十五分開始投票，各黨派投票，皆根據早先渠等領袖所下之訓令而行事者，賴瑪迪由於感情激動，在投票前，發出震　之呼籲，要求對政府明白信任擁護，以避免法國分裂。渠謂：「吾人要求忠於法國及共和之人士，對政府投信任票，而反對法國或猶疑不決者，則對吾人投不信任票，因最惡劣之可能情勢依然存在，此即法國是否將分裂成親蘇陣營或親美陣營，抑將法國以其自由意志與一切國家合作是也」。賴瑪迪又爲答覆戴高樂舉行公民投票之要求稱：「此係吾人是否將利用公民投票之　言，以謀推翻議會」。議長赫禮歐宜佈開會時，旁聽席上三分之二皆吿客滿，此爲賴瑪迪向議會要求信任之第七次，而無疑亦爲最危險之一次。共產黨，極右政黨及共和自由黨投反對票，人民共和黨則投信任票</p>

<h3>盟國初步對日賠償要求總數達五百四十億美元　我國要求總數百分之四十</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅日電〕太平洋十一盟國之初步對日賠償要求，根據片面估計，總數約達五百四十億美元。某負責人士稱，各國向此間遠東委員會提出之要求，以中國爲冠，要求總數有分之四十。根據菲律賓官方要求賠償四十一億元及要求在全部賠償品中取得百分之十五估計，中國之要求數目約爲一百二十億元。</p>
<p>遠東委會同時宣布，過去八日來努力抑低各國之要求，並未成立地議。按德日兩國之賠償總數，須待最後和約規定。蘇聯對德要求賠償約一百億元，對日要求釣爲三十三億元，日本之賠償總數並未宜布，但根據百分比，約在一百四十億元左右。其他各國要求之百分比如下：澳洲二十八，加拿大一。五，法國十二，印度十二。五，荷蘭十二，紐西蘭二，英國二十五，美國二十八。美國已放棄對業已撥充分配工廠之任何要求，但對于以後重大賠償品之分配，仍保留發言　。當初直接對日戰爭十一國分別提出各國自身應得之賠償比例及其認爲他國應得之比例。結果各國自身應得之比例共百分之二〇四。五，他國應得之比例僅爲百分之九十二。自本年二月間談判以來，最初之比例數已抑至百分之一八九。查賠償總數與分配辦法之最後協定應列入對日和約之內。美國曾提議召開對日和約十一國初步會　，因蘇聯堅決反對而罷。蘇聯主張由四大國主持。菲代表羅慕洛促事有行使否決權各國省用其特權，並稱，賠償問題遷延一日，撥存之日本設備即多蝕毀一日。</p>
<h3>法議會延會</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎卅日電〕賴瑪迪領導之聯合內閣，於獲得議會之信任票後，國民議會即通過延會，改至十一月十三日即議會秋季曾議原定復會之日復會，使賴瑪迪內閣得有兩星期之安定期。</p>

<h3>法官審閱自白書　張春帆昨未提訊　冷山在警局陳述經過與筱伶僅係普通友誼</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國泰越劇院經理張春帆因筱丹桂自殺案，涉嫌被拘，刻在地檢處偵查中，陳壽陶撿察官審閱警局送來自白需筆餘等，至爲忙碌，本擬昨日提張偵訊，因尙未閱完，故改期再予提訊。至冷山在警局陳述之筆錄，其大意如下：「冷山本名金兆元，年三十歲，蘇州人，業電影，因在國泰編導，得與筱丹桂相識，僅係普通友誼，與筱雖有信來往，但皆係檢討</p>
<p>演戲藝術，別無其他，且係普通信件，故已遺失，七日前幾天，筱丹桂曾有電話約於當日下午八時在大華看電影，至時在大華相晤，因距電影放映時間尙早，遂僱汽車去兆　公園，下車後行走數步折回，邊走邊談，行至大西路靜安寺路，各自</p>
<p>分手歸返，已十時許。八日下午六時張等尋我至彼處，張叫筱丹桂不要說話，讓我自白，言及看電影逛馬路也是普通事情，張大怒謂，「你普通我不普通」，並伸手當面打來，把我眼鏡碰落，後經人勸住，張又說：「若眞未與筱開過房間，立即</p>
<p>跪地罰咒」。我臨走時曾謂：「如因我使你們夫婦不睦，我從此不與筱見面。」至筱伶究爲何自殺，原因不知，自對質後，即未與筱見面。」筱丹桂之妹王錢　韻在警局則證稱：「我姊平素少言，與張同居七年，惟無生育，每日早晚我必去　處玩玩，均談家務不及其他。錢財方面，我姊與張劃分淸楚，姊極儉樸，時常抄讀劇本，與張感情甚佳同居至今，</p>
<p>從未口角。八日聞人言，我妹與男人同觀電影，曾被張問過，我因未在，不知底細。九日下午我去妹處，見張與冷山及吳先生閉門談話，所談何事，並不知情。此後時見姊有哭泣情形，惟仍至國泰遊玩，若無其事。十三日我在浙東樓上水仙房中出來，走過姊房門外，看見姊盤脚坐在床上，不知是用指還是用筆，在被褥上劃字，未留心看淸，不久聞魏在姊</p>
<p>房中大叫：「春鳳妹（即筱丹桂）怎樣了！」我立即進人姊房中，見張抱住我姊問，「春鳳怎樣？春鳳怎樣？」旋送醫院，不治身亡，其餘情形，均不知道，我姊並不負債，與張感情良好，惟國泰劇院曾坍一屋角，鄉間房子被火焚去，杭州購進之屋被人佔住，心中常鬱鬱不快。」</p>

<h3>同命鴛侶　天津北洋　飯店　發生　慘劇　未婚夫婦悠然服毒</h3>
<p>〔本報天津廿八日航訊〕天津北洋飯店三模五十九號，在二十八日中午發現了一對年靑的未婚夫婦雙雙服毒自殺的慘案，他們是親饜着死去的，兩個人互相擁抱着，並且女的還枕着男的右臂。</p>
<p>發生這慘劇的房間，在樓上的東北角，房間的東而北面各有窗戶，北窗口乘着一幅黃底雜花的窗簾，房間裏有一架衣櫃，一個臉盆，一架梳妝台，一張方桌，還有一個茶几，銅床放在牆側。銅床上便躺着這一對自殺的育年。男的陲在床內側，穿着白布小褂、白布長褲。女的穿着白襯衫，白　褲，上身還罩着一件月靑小褂，頭枕在男的右臂上。在死者的面目上，看不出他們臨死時的痛苦掙扎，他們似乎是悠然的就失去了知覺，辭別了這人世。據北洋飯店的茶房說：</p>
<p>這一對靑年是二十七日下午兩點鐘去開的房間，旅客登記簿上塡的名字是：　慶龍與董氏宴淸。年齡都是二十三歲，瀋陽人。職業欄內寫着信遠銀號。房間開好後，二人即相偕外出，入夜以後才回來，回來後向茶房借用筆墨，寫了一封信，自己出去把信投在飯店門口的郵筒內，然後就向茶房要開水，接着他們就閉門入睡了。二十八日午十二時，茶房交班巡視房間，便發現這一對靑年已經價臥在床上。</p>
<p>次院據將檢驗：實慶龍牙床，唇部，脚心，均現靑色，週身發現有</p>
<p>靑色的斑痕</p>
<p>董氏業完全一樣，嘴裏尙含有少量白色藥粉。在死者床前茶几上，發現有五百元鈔票一張，上面也殘留着一些白色的藥粉，另外還有天津達生製藥公司出品「萬痛定」仿單一張半，背面寫着「麻醉劑」三字，檢驗員判定死者確係服</p>
<p>大量麻醉劑致死。</p>
<p>根據死者身份證所載：男的確名賽慶龍，又名實以昶，天津人，女各董吉鳳，二十三歲，營口人，現住津市寳鷄道吉星南里五號。賽慶龍原在聯勤總部第三敎養隊服務，現已脫離，尙無職業，與其異母兄賽明爐同住於友人處，與董吉鳳由</p>
<p>友誼而戀愛已於本年六月二日訂婚。董吉鳳曾肄業天津天申中學，並曾任小學敎員，二人平素感情甚爲融洽。賽明煊說：賽慶能訂婚後不久，就失業，他們沒法早結婚，這可能是他們自殺的原因，董吉鳳有老父老母，還有兩位妹妹，一個兄弟，據她妹妹說：董吉鳳平常就說：「賽以利就是我的一塊累」，在二十七日上午，她以到河東二嫂處爲名，向她母親要了兩千元車錢，又向她妹妹要了一萬元，說是到南開去，不料就此一夜未歸，次日這慘劇就發生了。警察曾在</p>
<p>董吉鳳衣袋內發現了一張撕裂的紅信箋，上面寫着：「父母親大人膝下：敬稟者，這次的我，想不到」敎語，似乎可以推斷死者自殺前投郵的那封信，可能是董吉鳳寄同家裏去的。這一幕自殺案的原因，也許在那封信自己說明了的，只等收信人收到後就可以大白。（記者李紹林）</p>

<h3>無證外棉製成之紗布　中信局向外推銷　協助民營廠爭取國際市塲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局前收購到埠無證外棉，委託名紗廠紡紗，本月內可全部繳淸。並已依照原定計劃進入外銷階段。其中除棉紗出口外，大部份係調換棉布出口，一小部份並調換汗衫手巾絨毯等棉織品出口。棉布部份除巾國紡建公司代紡布疋，洽定九。十。十一。三個月運銷馬尼刺共十五萬疋外，餘由中信局自行接洽外銷。木月份已先後訂約十八萬七千一百疋均係民營紗廠出口，計人鐘牌細布三萬疋，四平運細布五萬五千疋，富貴細布三萬三千疋，大鵬細布二千五百疋，ABC細布一萬五千六百疋，警喜印花布四千八百疋，秦良玉漂布五萬疋，新光襯衫府綢六千二百疋，共十七萬二千一百疋。又棉紗一九八〇件，計人鐘廿一支紗三百件，吉象廿一支紗一五〇件，好做牌廿一支紗一百件，　喜牌廿支紗二百件，雙馬廿一支紗八八〇件，天女廿支紗三百件，四十二支五十件。上列民營廠紗布品質皆屬上等，惟各廠因國內成本較國外售價爲高，無法自行外銷，各稱牌號，在國外大多尙乏基礎。此次中信局盡力代各民營廠向國外推銷，使民營廠所產之紗布，得藉各該廠自有牌號，在國際市塲爭取立足點，將來可逐漸開展，足與其他國家，甚至與日本紡織業頡頏競爭。故此次中信局辦理紗布外銷，意義相當重大。不僅爲政府獲致外匯，抑且扶助民營，爲民營紡織出口事業關一途徑。現紡織品外銷委員會成立，據中信局表示，如進行順利，則上項無證外棉所紡成之紗布，十一月份可望有更多之輸出。又據統計，中信局外銷地區，有香港，　羅，愛登，巴斯拉，波斯灣，　拉克，叙利亞，巴達維亞，新加坡，馬尼刺等地。</p>
<h3>棉紗議價再提高　紗布市況呈活躍　細紗銷路較暢價見回昂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會棉紗議價，昨日再台調整，廿支紗掛高爲一九八五萬元，較前又提高九五萬元。其他各支紗，仍按比例及參酌市况，分別計算。</p>
<p>中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售八六八件，台廿支紗一三三四件半，全部售予廠商，申購者共二四六戶。</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，人心由疲轉堅，買戶活動，行情驟見起色。尤以細紗銷胃較暢，結果四二支藍鳳紗比上日回昂九十萬，爲三千三百五十萬元。其他各支粗細紗則互有二三十萬元上下。</p>
<p>棉布市勢，因多日盤旋，一般浮多已出淸，實力派見價低搜進，更以紡建棉紗議價提高，人心頓呈堅俏，新買亦有活動。最後十二磅龍頭等各擋細布，比上日均回漲自五千至一萬五千元，四君子嗶嘰粵帮採辦價升二萬五千元，其他各布市亦大多挺俏。</p>
<p>現棉仍平</p>
<p>昨日現棉交易淸稀，市况平淡，紗廠進意尙有，但價格不高，交易擱淺，同業微有吸胃，成交不旺。市價與上日相同，全日成交八百三十包。送廠價僅做開一筆，爲漢口組絨二八一萬，棧交價做開靈寳三七六萬，歸德二九八萬，啓東三二四萬，沙市三五九萬，漢細三三〇包，火機二五〇萬，二五六萬，周浦籽花五九萬六千。</p>
<h3>食米盤旋　麺粉疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬一千四百餘石，店方納　較濃，市况略見活靈，粳秈元米一致同升萬元，至萬餘元不一。陰元亦加一二萬元，上落甚微，形入盤旋之格。麵粉銷化不吒，重入疲境，回跌三四千元。麩皮鄉銷見呆，猛挫六七千元。</p>
<p>豆餅汕頭採納，提高三四千元。黃豆油廠遇巧拾取，本街進　尙續，市形堅挺之狀。菉豆南洋去化蟬聯，挺進萬元。赤豆廣帮俠然搜購，市勢牢硬。　豆另化淸閒，續挫萬元。缸豆油頭吸胃甚貪，盤高萬元。</p>
<p>紅糧進戶續進，步砌三五千元，苞米北洋動而不旺，形勢站立。芝蔴本街交易熟鬧。油廠去化爽快，高貨步漲日二三萬元，中下亦升一二萬元。生仁外埠不動，另化尙殷，依然挺秀。</p>
<p>油市堅疲互有，生汕因江北大宗抵申，人心虛浮，續跌五六萬元。豆油則去胃活絡，再挺三五萬元。菜油麻油升一二三萬元不一。</p>
<h3>統債見穩　外股平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨較穩健，五五五室六二八室有供，五〇三室五五二室三六○室均進，統丙晨開二一六〇〇元，自二一四○〇元盤升至二二八〇〇元，而後轉定。結果較前收計甲乙尙平，丙種升四百元，丁種好六百元，戊種漲五百元，成交約六百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨平庸少變，港申電回升至六元半左右，熟股高後有同。怡紗最開一九一〇〇○元，低價一九〇〇〇〇元，巾途見一九七○○〇元高價，惟午後仍回小至晨初價收市，證券帮有賣，洋商則進。給果較前收計航業跌半成，墾植升半成，英聯會德豐電話微升，紙業怡啤微挫，業廣鋼業怡紗尙平。</p>
<h3>內銷茶價堅定</h3>
<p>昨日茶市：外銷花色，出口商與貨主之談判，依然米見順利，致形勢並不活躍。他若內銷茶，本街店莊等地之可納仍悅，成交數量遂繼續砌加，價格方面，亦內費戶堅持有勁，一致見秀，且其中尤以木年度　琳紅茶及平水旗槍，受存底將較少影響，漲風竟日未休，結果此前軋升二三十萬元至五六十萬元不姊。又悉：適來常州一帶對於低檔　紅茶，俱據進取。</p>
<h3>草帽原料進口　廠商申請踴躍</h3>
<p>輸出品製造原料進口辦法，輸管會已呈政院核示，該會以金絲及蔴草兩種草帽原料，富於季節性，特先行核辦。據悉：該會輸出推廣處，自上週開始以來，辦理情形，極爲良好。迄至目前爲止，已收到申請案件三十餘件，各草帽商均能遵照規定，覓得指定銀行之保證，保證是批草帽原料進口造成品輸出後，値一元美金，確能分別換取三元及六元之美金，決不消耗國家之外匯。該會將各申請案件審核後，即送非限額審核處核發一許可進口蹬。各商即往馬尼拉購買原料，製迭草帽。預計兩月後，即可輸出。此項輸出。戰前每年約値兩百萬美金，此次據非正式統計，亦可換得兩百萬美金，已能恢復戰前之成績。我出產草帽地區，爲浙江之海門，餘姚，江蘇之常熟等處，全係農村副業，工作極為精緻，爲歐美婦女所樂用，故銷路不成問題。</p>
<h3>買氣難以持久華股高後盤低</h3>
<p>華股昨證券幫大戶買意，受减低證金之鼓勵而稍興奮，但仍感孤獨。乏人助興，是以中途雖見一度振作，仍難特久。午後生活指數發表，遽有隱憂，賣方乘隙活動，又將買氣鎭壓，高後逐漸盤低。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>以借款消息略形沉悶，而報載蹬金減低之訊復起，開出見昂。永紗開後穩定於二八三元左右，遞交則自二九二元升至二九四元。旋退至二七九元及二八九元，又升至二八四元及二九四元，成交仍淸，興繳不高，是以塲外息價雖開低至一角半及一角九分半，是時不脫徘徊，無甚特變。繼又升至二八五元及二九六元，以有供給即交，了結遞交者，略有回低，津證交有開幕訊，銀行幫等有進，近午盤高至即交二八九元，遞交三〇○元大關。廣幫供售，亨鼠方而亦售即交，並有其機出籠，而後略盤，午收爲二八八元及二九八元。華同漲最多，中絲中法統益次之，熱股泰半穩健，結果較前收即交股計會　漲一成，中法中絲統益升半成，中紡中興悟　火柴麗安信誼平平，國貨微降。餘股均稍上升，遞交股計信和華盟升半成光景，餘均小升。</p>
<h3>九月份本市行莊　有款及準備金額</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行稽核處發表，本年九月份本市各行莊存款及準備金總額比較，計存款總額一。四六八。六二三。六五三。六二七元，內活存一。三四三一。四七七。四七一。八五八元，一定存一二五。一四六。一八一。七六八元，已繳準備金總額二一四。一二七。五〇二。一三一元，與八月份之數額相伯仲。</p>
<h3>人造絲回升　廠經綢貨去胃旺</h3>
<p>人造絲連朝疲憊，昨吿回升，上午一二〇號旭字有光，開盤時尙稱平穩，旋因各方吸意甚濃，喊價節節上升，最大喊到八千二百萬元。中午收盤時退做八千○三十萬元成交，下午稍疲，最後賣出價爲七千九百萬元。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨市交易頗形熱絡，另擔去胃甚好，成交價比上日大起一百萬元。C字等級五担頭拆貨，做價六千五百萬元，高另担三百萬元，中級另担一百五十萬至二百萬元，干經銷路，比較呆滯，行情亦較上日爲高，特上另担，四千三百萬至四百萬元有成交。</p>
<p>後市</p>
<p>永紗曾見二九三元及三〇一元高價，旋以生活指數提高，紗廠業咸有恐慌之說，賣風一起，買戶又告畏縮，國行交換復有差進，步降至即交二八一元及二八九元低價。即交又微升為二八三元，遞交則仍爲二八九元收市。熱股微挫，雜股尙穩，尤以新亞成交不多，跳起較多。結果較長收計即交股新亞獨升一成，中紡內衣景緰火柴徵升，統益　安恒　平平，永紗信和勒興美亞華豐新光景福巾法新華華新信誼中絲榮　均告小挫。遞交股計永紗信和美亞景福勤興微降，新光降半成弱，　外各老股計華商證券有　股隹訊，銀行股大戶搜吸，文化股有上市訊，均吿上升。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市因原料告升而俏俐，眞絲被面大誠興華强貨，開市在二百四十萬元左右，後升至四十五萬元之　盤旋，頃刻間即高至六十萬元即期價，終因買氣不衰，卒昂至七十餘萬元有人買進，隔日期到九十萬元。生活指數提高，綢貨成本不免抬高，故人心頗好，其他各貨，均亦堅秀。</p>
<h3>第四期進口限額　延至下週公佈</h3>
<p>輪出入管理委員會之第三期限額，已於昨日到期。今晨應公佈第四期進口限額，惟因全國經濟委員會對四期限額之數字尙未商定，故今晨無法公佈，需延至下週內始可公佈云。</p>
<p>又該會之第三期限額雖已到期，但大部份均尙未分配，則第一二兩期限額尙有一部份未會分配完竣，故該會刻在加强分配。四期限額之延遲公佈，對事實並無影響云。</p>
<h3>各地棉花商　籌糾聯合會</h3>
<p>全國性之祝花業同業公會，業已推定南通，漢口，沙市，上海，四地之同業公會為發起人，籌備推動同業參加，以謀鞏固全國棉花商同業之組織，並謀展開本業之業務，與推進同業之福利。茲聞本市方面已推定劉屏蓀，張啓良，唐叔明，施成孫等十二人爲籌備委員，而各地代表亦均將於日內抵滬，共商籌備事宜，並向社會部經濟部等登記，約於十二月月問可正式成立。</p>
<h3>大衣呢再漲</h3>
<p>大秀呢又轉秀色，昨頭號英製開水味大衣呢，每碼齊沽五百萬元左右，銀搶售二百萬元上下，美麗爲一百四十萬元，意製大衣呢一百萬元，中紡黑灰九十五萬元，美國大衣呢八十萬元至一百萬元，天祥培豐大衣呢售九十五萬元，黃邊平厚呢爲一百五十萬元。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>四聯總處貸款委員會，定今日午後三時，假外灘中央銀行會議案舉行會議。申請貸款案件近兩百件，申請貸款分之八十為生產貸款。</p>
<p>國行貼放委員會工業貸款審查委員會昨日召開第卅次會議，審查工業貸款申請案件共計卅八件，通過廿九件，計總額八十五億六千萬元。</p>
<p>國藥市況，前昨稍呈活潑，生地，牛膝，受戰事影響，來源斷絕，求過於供。十六支生地突躍一萬六千元，小生地九千元，後市仍有續升之勢云。</p>
<p>昨日捲煙行情告秀，十支太英老刀比上日步漲五十萬至四十七萬元，其餘中外條烟及五十支聽裝燜，亦好一。二千至四。五千元不等。</p>
<p>日用品市面堅挺，各牌肥皂同昂三千至六。七千元。火柴美麗鳳凰亦升十萬至五萬，雜牌平穩。</p>
<p>杉本市況，略爲堅挺，因銷路鬆動，買方逢低有吸。</p>

<h3>敬悼報人　兪頌華先生</h3>
<p>— 呂竹</p>
<p>報壇先進兪頌華先生不幸於十月十一日病逝蘇州，噩耗傳出，各方悲慟。蘇州各界並定十一月二日在拙政園舉行追悼會，並決定將森氏遺體營葬條城勝地靈岩山，以使遊人覽勝憑弔。</p>
<p>兪氏生於民國前十九年，早歲曾留學日本，民國八年氏應張束蓀氏邀入時事新報主編「學燈」，此實爲氏參加新聞工作的開始，迄今已靈卅年；嗣後繼主編解放，改造雜誌，介紹西洋新思潮如烏托邦，民主主義等，其間又曾一度漫遊蘇聯德國及東歐各國，在德國時，並入柏林大學深迭。返國後，担任中國公學敎務畏，時胡適爲校長，此時氏於敎務之暇開始兼編東方雜誌，「一二八」後加人申報，初編申報月刋及週刋繼主筆政。抗戰開始，胡文虎邀他到粵創辦星粵日報，因局勢動盪未成，廿九年赴香港星洲日報担任主筆，嗣又被邀遠赴星加坡担任星島日報總編輯，太平洋戰爭起後，氏化裝輾轉逃出，先後祖任廣西日報及衡陽大剛報總編輯。觀氏一生，除兼敎職外，未嘗稍離報壇，抗戰勝利後，氏到蘇州主特國立社敎學院新聞系，仍在虛心積慮爲新聞界造就人才，誰知計劃未成，而身先逝，此固兪氏抱恨，而亦爲我新聞界一大損失。</p>
<p>余之與兪氏相識始於今夏。遠在四年前，余在重慶因感社會風氣敗壞，人心萎頓，亦在學燈連續爲文介紹烏托邦的理想，闡述歐根，柏克森等的哲學，而無形與兪氏二十年前的作風相合，因而對兪氏生了敬慕之心。今夏余聞兪氏在滬養疴，特地去拜訪了他一次，他剛病愈，我們由當時國內物價狂漲談起，一直談到世界問題，我雖與他初識而竟毫無陌生感，兪氏健談，談竟無盡，我們竟談了四個多鐘點。兪氏很敏感也很激動，談到國內局勢時，他一再沉痛的說：中國大多數的人民太痛苦了，凡是有良心的知識份子，都應該自己犧牲一點，而爲人民多作些事。談到新聞從業人員，兪氏很客觀的說：一個眞正的新聞從業員，應該是沒有黨派關係，沒有黨派關係，才不曾有所偏袒，眞正的新聞從業員是忠實的分析與批評，分析與批評的關鍵在沒有偏袒的觀念，所以兪氏目己直到死爲止，還是一個無黨派的純國民。</p>
<p>兪氏身體據說本很孱弱，而在由香港逃難後又歷經風霜，在湘桂路，黔桂路上逃難，兪氏孱弱的體驅經此拙殘實已種下了這次的死因。勝利後因物價高漲，兪氏全家皆工作，而兪氏竟不能獲得較好的調養，兪氏每月在蘇執教所得不足百萬元，平日針藥皆由兪夫人（兪夫人供職中央銀行）節餘供給，兪氏之病固爲積勞，而如能稍獲調養尙不致驟然早逝，余悼兪氏之逝，余惜兪氏之早逝，報界無窮損失，社會無盡損失，而令日之社會有責任焉—　十月卅日於滬</p>
<h3>敬悼兪頌華</h3>
<p>— 儲裕生</p>
<p>兪先生是本報的老同事，他進申報是在民國廿一年，專門主編月刋的，據現在的一位老同事潘愼常先生說：「我當時主辦月刋的發行，一天戶限爲穿，不上五天已定出十萬份」。因爲當時申報的月刋，很有魄力的指賣日本的侵略。以一個定期刋物而能銷過十萬份的，這恐怕只有兪先生主編的申報月刋了罷！</p>
<p>兪先生的身體很孱弱，個子也長得很矮小，我們在重慶南溫泉的時候，常去找他，他正在中央政校新聞系執敎，總是和藹的爲我們講解一切。他住的是一問小小的茅屋，眞是所謂斗室，我們知道他很窮，但到他部裏，總是香茗花生有得吃的。</p>
<p>以後我時常到重慶去，他住在張家花園要爬很多坡，我常去看他，他也常常到我這要來，我問他用什麼交通工具，他拍拍自己的兩條腿，我想到他要爬這樣高的坡，又要走這樣遠的路，我幾乎流下眼淚來了。</p>
<p>卅六年六月我在蘇州看到他，他的身體更壞，說話也沒有從前　亮了，背更　曲了，但他還是有着無比的雄心與魄力。</p>
<p>聽說他不幸在十月十一日死了，我在蘇州和他的一面克是最後的相遇，以他這樣一個有學問又正直的人，社會上竟不能好好的保養他，讓他受着凌霜傲雪的欺侮，這是誰的責任呢？</p>
<h3>談聾啞</h3>
<p>— 亞强</p>
<p>前見報載立法院稱聲啞者有被選爲國大代表的權利，這種規定，不單是符合「民主一的意義，且可消除平時一般人對於聾啞者的輕視與冷淡。</p>
<p>一般人輕視聾啞者，是因爲他們不能「聽」，也不會「說」，眞够得上孤陋寡聞。這種缺陷，在聾啞者之間，是有方法彌補的。聾啞兒童一入學校，就學「識字」，每一字，每一詞，都有一手式表示出來。書讀得多了，手式也學得多，相互問就可稱心如意，指手劃脚地傳達自己的意思，與普通人談話一樣。至於一些沒有受過敎育的，亦有一些共通的手式代替語言。聾啞者雖是「殘廢」，却有比普通人「高明」的地方。筆者見聾啞學校三年級學生臨　人像，維妙維肖，五六年級學生的岡董比普通中學的學生所養的出色得多，聾啞學校畢業生，不少是優秀的廣吿畫，佈景，雕……等的藝術工作者。他們因爲沒有「聲」的煩擾，匠心獨具，在藝術上的造就，確比普通八高一等。</p>
<p>據研究聾啞敎育者言，聾啞者除了「衣暖食飽」以外，可說是沒有其他的慾望了。不像普通人「豐衣足食」外，沉緬於「聲色」，爭逐於「名利」，結果，却賺來了無限的煩惱與痛苦。聾啞者沒有這種慾望，也就减除了不少的痛苦。他們的心情，實比普通人清靜不少。</p>
<p>世事混濁，人心同測，一般意志純潔者流，免不了要悲嘆抑鬱，假如做了聾啞者，少聞少問，倒可以减少了許多精神上的「刑罰」將寳貴的精力，用在祟高的藝術上，美化「人生」貢獻人類，這樣說來，對於聾啞者，非但不應輕視，還應愛慕哩。</p>
<h3>馮道的幽默</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>五代時，馮相（道）和相（凝）同在中書，一日和問馮曰：「公靴新買其値幾何？」馮舉左足示和臼：「九百，」和性褊急，遽回顧小吏云：「吾靴何得用一千八百？」因詬責。久之，馮徐舉其右足曰：「此亦九百。」於是哄堂大笑。（歸田錄）</p>
<h3>京官生涯</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>「莫道不銷魂，簾捲西風，人比黃花瘦。」</p>
<p>引李淸照這三句詞，來形容目前首都一般公務人員的儀態，眞是最洽當也沒有了。尤其中秋隹節過後的「十月漲風」，若驚濤駭浪般的「物價」向上飛昇，使這班掙扎於貧困境域之中的京官們，又跳了一次火山。日來雖已驚魂甫定，但「南京」成了「難」京，他們怎能不更加消瘦呢！</p>
<p>本來，別提猶罷，一提起一般京官的生涯，除了那些少數比較有辦法的，仍能居必洋樓，出必汽車之外，大多數恐不免都索居於寒窘的苦况里。秋深了，「全家盡在西風里，九月寒衣未翦裁」者，正是大有人在咧。</p>
<p>京官們的生涯，也是很枯澀而呆板的，一天七八小時冷板凳，不就呌人感到怪膩倦麼？天，還在朧朦的景色里，居住在離辦公處所較遠的，便得起身赶交通車去了，太太不貪睡嫩覺的，或者還不必自入廚房燒早火，否則，便只得自己勞駕了。下得班回家，假若你是一個爸爸的話，那也得兼任一下保姆的責任，給太太聊盡義務。七件事吿乏了，十九也得自已去解決，所謂「貧賤夫妻百事哀」，處境越困，心境也就越劣，於是家庭的勃谿，乃亦成「司空見慣」的常事。</p>
<p>若說衣食難繼成爲京官們心理上的第一重威脅，那麼「房荒」便無疑是第二重魔障了。這兒所謂「房荒」，並非眞正沒有房子，而是他們住不起的問題。首都的大小機關這麼多，由機關供給宿舍的却成鳳毛麟角，單身漢或許有機關的宿舍可住，而有眷屬者則絕無僅有。幾個公敎新村，只能容納十百分之一的人居住，也已爲捷足先登者得去；空着的高樓大廈倒似乎不少，最近一年來新築起洋房也矗立處處，可是動輒千餘萬的押金，豈是食衣難繼的小京官能敢奢望的。即使一間最蹩脚的平房，目論也要一次預收租押金一二百萬元，數目已相當驚人的了。這樣，居無所，使一般將眷屬擱在家鄉的人再也不敢作「團圓」之想。</p>
<h3>論义麻將</h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>我國人賭中除舊式紙牌外。大釣以麻將的歷史爲最久，以普遍性言，也以麻將爲第一，不但它曾遠征歐美，幾曾爲日本國賭之一。麻將又名麻雀。來源雖各有說法，但發明者必爲浙江人無疑。有考據家說發明人姓中名發白，我看這係猜測之詞。好比歐美的紙牌究爲誰發明恐亦無法指出，但可確定者開始時必爲紙牌之一，經續改良的。</p>
<p>賭中，新玩意兒不管是輪　，撲克，沙哈，跑馬，舊賭如牌九，骰子，紙脾。均沒有將引人之勝。我們今天來統計一下，我國人犧牲在麻將中的時間實在是駭人聽聞的。</p>
<p>現在以上海爲例，假定上海現在人口有四百萬，以四人爲一戶，則有一百萬戶。一百萬戶中有二十萬戶家有麻將，而有十萬戶每天在搓麻將，每戶搓麻將要四個人，十萬戶則爲四十萬人，每次最小限度爲八圈，每四圈以一小時半計算，則每戶四人一天所耗費之時間則爲十二小時，十萬戶則爲一百二十萬小時，每天工作八小時，則爲十五萬工作天，換言之，上海人四百萬戶每天浪費在搓麻將上面的時問共爲十五萬工作天，一個月平均　卅天計算，一個月則浪費四百五十萬天，一年五千四百萬天，一年以三百六十五天計算則爲十四萬八千年，每人平均活六十歲（這指都市人而言）則有二千四百六十六個人一生一世白活，其他　市可以照此類推，我間來做任何事情沒有不成功的，問題是做什麼呢？這一方面要看當事者自己的反省，一方面要看當政者的領導，我以爲壓追和禁止都沒有用的。</p>
<h3>楹聯脞語</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>先烈宋敎仁先生就義時，有某名士擬代哀世凱挽以聯云：「旣生瑜何生亮？鄉不死孤不安」。聊聊十二字，純用三國演義成語，異常切當，所謂文章本天成，妙手偶得之，信乎！然亦虐矣。</p>
<p>琵琶記作者高明字則誠，浙之永嘉人，六七歲時即穎異不凡。鄰有尙書某，緋袍出送客，則誠適自熟師處歸，時衣綠衣，尙書戲語之曰：「出水蛙兒穿綠襖，美目盼兮」。則誠應聲曰：「落湯蝦子着紅抱，鞠躬如也」。尙書大驚異，稱爲奇童。</p>
<p>民國廿二年，余過慈谿西鄉之崇仁觀，見字紙爐前有一聯云：「此日昇天憑火化，當年落地作金聲」。以眼前情境，而悟出常年現實，以一「火」字，而引出下聊「金」字，可謂工穩之至。誠非嶄輪老手不能也。</p>
<p>美國小姐</p>
<h3>美國小姐的夏令生活</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>夏令是美國女性最活躍的季節，以健康美見稱的女人惟有在夏令才可以充分賣弄她們的曲線，所以夏令成爲美國女人的世界，其他法國女人英國女人中國女人一到夏令，惟有藏拙，不願把一捻搜腰全副排骨供人欣賞。美國小姐賣弄曲線的方式極多，衣着尤居首要，先說褲子，一種是長褲Slack，這是袴帶很鬆的一種大腿管袴子，與西裝褲完全不同，和中國女子所用長褲如出一轍，這種褲子最易襯托出臀部的曲線美，因爲襠以上是繃得緊緊的，這得歸功於計設師的設想週到。上裝有西班牙式短袖敞胸蟬紗衫，有緊身遝動汗衫，把胸部兩峯襯托得特別高，有背部赤露半面裝，也就彷彿是女用的大禮服上牛　，還有類似游泳衣的夏季便服，總之把胸部臀部和腿部儘量襯托其曲線美，她們在夏季的活動，種類極多，游泳池是她們每日必到之所，即使不會游泳的也穿了游泳衣在池邊茶室喝可口可樂，和男客兜搭作樂。</p>
<p>在隣海城市，沙灘上太陽傘底下一對對睡着的都是靑年男女，她們帶來旅行躺椅，啤酒，三明治，汽水，在灼熾的沙灘上消磨整個下午，她們決不能在灼熾的沙灘上納凉，顯然是爲了賣弄健康美，把皮膚嗮成栗穀色Sun－tanred，如果皮膚太白，不够健美，少不得買一瓶栗殼色塗料敷在全身，假充健康。如果你有一位知心的女友，你不妨留意她隨時在憂慮着皮膚不　焦黑，並會到沙灘上和公園中把外衣完全脫掉，祇穿一條游泳襪，把手帕蓋了面孔，平睡在沙灘或草地上曬太陽，曬焦不喊痛，爲了健美，不得不下此苦工，寗可議皮膚脫落。</p>
<p>溜冰塲也是美國小姐賣弄健美之所，溜冰是表現大腿美的好機會，而溜冰的功夫完全在兩隻腿上，溜冰技　練熟了，大腿也就自然健美了，我們幾乎找不出一個溜冰家的大腿發育得不美的，溜冰的姿勢更有助於胸部和腰部美的糾正。會溜冰的人，胸部一定特別高，腰支一定特別直，溜冰最有助於腰部以下肌肉的發育，所以會溜冰的女性也往往就是最理想的愛人。美國女性把溜冰，游泳，跳舞，列爲發展健美的必修科目。</p>
<h3>飛機應稱仐</h3>
<p>— 鄭大康</p>
<p>現在圖書館已有　字爲單名，而今日空中之飛機，猶水陸之舟車，同爲交通要其，尙無一專名單字，惟用一機字代之，而機字用處已多，如機器之機，機會之機等。考成語中，本有乘機下野乘機出走，乘機××等語，在今日飛機盛行之下，即不免抵觸誤會。故飛機單字之創立，實有其必要。查康熙字典備考丑集，厶部有　字，音尖而無義，用之飛機之專名單字、甚爲適當，不僅聲音相同，且其字上部之厶，像飛機之旋集，中一　像兩翼—像機身，乃一巧合之像形文字，以此推之，則航空之航，亦可創一航字，以別航船之航，今後若以　　代機航，不僅字義明晰，而筆畫簡單，書寫亦較便利矣。</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Report to the State Council: U.S. Has Deepened Understanding of China, Correctly Understands Northeast Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] The United States has a profound understanding of China. This is Foreign Minister Wang's impression after returning from the United States. In his report to the State Council on the 31st, he particularly believed that the U.S. attitude toward China has indeed improved. At the same time, Mr. Wang emphasized that the U.S. also deeply understands that China's Northeast issue must be resolved, and believes that if it cannot be resolved, China will not achieve peace, and the world will also be threatened. Regarding the Palestine partition issue, Mr. Wang submitted a report stating: Our country's attitude is temporarily reserved, and we will state our position when the dispute between the federal and partition systems is somewhat closer. Finally, Mr. Wang explained in detail the United Nations General Assembly, the Korean issue, and the small committee. Mr. Wang's report lasted for an hour.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] Bai Chongxi reported on military affairs at the State Council meeting on the 31st, stating briefly: The current military focus is on the two battlefields of Northeast China and Shaanxi.

<h3>U.S. Congressman Judd Arrives in Shanghai to Gather Information</h3>
<p>[Our Report] U.S. Congressman Walter Judd arrived at Jiangwan Airport from Beijing at 10:15 yesterday morning. After disembarking, he went to visit the Jiangwan National Defense Medical College. At noon, he was entertained by the American Chamber of Commerce. In the afternoon, he met with Chinese and foreign friends. At 5:30 p.m., at the request of local reporters, he held a press conference at the U.S. Information Service, answering reporters' questions in Beijing Mandarin. He said that the situation in North China was much better than he had imagined in the United States, and that China's revival was still promising.

Today, he is still scheduled to meet with Chinese and foreign figures throughout the day to gather information.

(Mr. Judd's remarks are published in the left corner of page two)</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 31st Dispatch] U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton emphasized that U.S.-China relations are of vital importance. Mr. Eaton has always advocated a tough stance against the Soviet Union, and he is also at the forefront of Vishinsky's list of "war mongers." He said: "The Chinese are a great nation with 5,000 years of glorious culture. In the midst of hundreds of years of internal and external troubles, they have still maintained their national essence. The United States will eventually find that its economic destiny is largely in the city. If China falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, the impact on our future will be so great and profound that it is impossible to predict. If China can maintain its independence and defeat communism, then its future from a global economic perspective will become increasingly closely linked to that of the United States."</p>
<p>Eaton said that the difference between the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding China is due to the Soviet Union's goal of absorbing the 400 million Chinese people and their vast resources so as to bring them under Soviet control. Our policy is to assist the great Chinese people in developing their independent national future.</p>
<h3>Use of Sino-Canadian Loan, Term Extended by One Year, Important Case Passed by State Council</h3>

<h3>Hundreds of Epiphyllum Blooms Simultaneously in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 31st Dispatch] Hundreds of Epiphyllum planted in St. Paul's Hospital in Guangzhou bloomed simultaneously at 6 p.m. on the 31st, which was extremely beautiful, but they withered and died one after another shortly afterward, and all the viewers marveled at it.</p>

<h3>Decision to Increase Education Funding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] The Ministry of Education is in charge of additional funds for the construction, expansion, and improvement of national schools and research institutions at all levels in the 36th year, the provincial and municipal education rehabilitation funds, and the winter coal budget for affiliated schools and institutions. The State Council approved the Executive Yuan's decision on the 31st and passed the additional figures as follows: Construction, expansion, and improvement funds for national schools and research institutions at all levels: 125 billion yuan. Provincial and municipal education rehabilitation funds: 10 billion yuan. Winter coal expenses for various schools and institutions: 33.866 billion yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] The National Assembly Friendship Association previously held a meeting and resolved, and 670 people, including Wang Guanying, jointly signed a request to convene a temporary National Assembly. The matter was reported to the State Council meeting on the morning of the 31st. After discussion, it was deemed that Wang and others' proposal to convene a temporary National Assembly only required the consent of two-fifths of the National Assembly representatives and had no legal basis, because the two-fifths referred to in the Constitution referred to the National Assembly representatives after the implementation of the Constitution, while the current requesters are the constituent National Assembly representatives. Therefore, after discussion, it was deemed that there was no legal basis, and it was rejected and handed over to the Secretariat to reply to the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] Flexible measures for overseas Chinese to participate in the election were passed at the State Council meeting on the 31st. The principle is that the election will be postponed in difficult areas, a two-stage election will be adopted in some areas, and the rest will be handled according to law after the Constitution is amended.</p>
<h3>Workers of Special Trade Unions Allowed to Participate in Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] In order to support workers' participation in politics, the government has recently submitted a report to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Social Affairs regarding workers who should organize special trade unions before the promulgation of the Trade Union Law for public enterprises, requesting permission to participate in the election of Legislative Committee members and National Assembly representatives in this session. This case was submitted for discussion and passed at the State Council meeting on the 31st. It is investigated that Article 6 of the Enforcement Regulations for the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives stipulates that the occupational groups and women's groups participating in the election are limited to those who have been registered with their competent authorities in accordance with the law. However, since the Trade Union Law has not yet been promulgated, the trade union organizations of various special trade unions such as telecommunications, mining, and railways have not been fully established, and various special trade unions have been assigned the number of Legislative Committee members and National Assembly representatives, so it should be remedied, and the preparatory personnel of each organization or the business institutions should refer to the supplementary notes on the election methods of special trade unions to create a register of participants in the election and send it to the local election office for election.</p>

<h3>Battle for Yongji Intensifies, Bandits Launch Fierce Attacks on Suburbs but Fail, Entire Shenyang-Changchun Railway Line Cleared of Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 31st Dispatch] The battle for Yongji is becoming increasingly fierce. Communist bandits are constantly reinforcing and shelling, and are making desperate charges. The National Army is cooperating by land and air to strike hard at the bandit hordes. In the past two days, the fighting at Huanxi Ridge in the western suburbs of Yongji has been the most brutal.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 31st Dispatch] The number of bandits attacking Yongji has reached 110,000, and their unit numbers are extremely chaotic. The bandits have transferred new reinforcements from northern Jilin to attack Yongji fiercely, especially in the Longhe Li Mountain and Yushanzi areas, where the fighting is even more fierce. However, those familiar with the Yongji situation generally believe that Yongji is surrounded by mountains and backed by water, forming a natural danger. In addition, the fortifications are strong, and the morale of the National Army is extremely high, so it is not easy for the bandits to succeed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 1st Dispatch] The battle for Yongji is intensifying. The main force of the bandit's First Column has infiltrated into the southwestern area of Yongji. The reinforcing bandit army launched repeated fierce attacks on the airfield (northeast of the city) and Sandao Lingzi (6 kilometers southwest of Yongji) with concentrated artillery fire on the night of the 30th, and fierce battles broke out with the defending army. In one night, the bandit army shelled the airfield more than a thousand times. Our defending army was loyal and courageous, and fought back fiercely against the stubborn bandit army. The bandits launched repeated attacks, but all failed. In addition, a bandit force of more than a thousand people, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on Huanxi Ridge, two kilometers west of Yongji, and fierce fighting is still underway.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 31st Dispatch] The Changchun battle situation is gradually entering a new stage. Previously, the bandits launched a sneak attack on Kuanchengzi Dafangshen Airport in the northwest suburbs, but ultimately failed. The National Army, which had been lingering in the suburbs for a long time, has re-blocked the checkpoints in the suburbs from this afternoon. The Communist bandits who launched a sneak attack on Changchun City the night before have been lingering in the northwest area of Changchun City in recent days. After the National Army launched an attack yesterday, there were many spoils.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 31st Dispatch] The National Army in Siping divided its troops and went north, and one route was unstoppable. The vanguard troops have arrived at Guojiadian and are continuing to advance. In addition, the defending army in Beipiao launched an attack on the 29th and has met with the National Army advancing westward from Changtu County. They are now launching a mop-up operation against the remaining bandits in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] A telegram from Shenyang today said: The National Army has joined forces at Gongzhuling, and the entire Panjin-Changchun Railway line has been cleared of all Communist bandits. At the same time, the defending army in Jilin fought hard for several days and annihilated the 20th Division of the Communist bandits.</p>

<h3>National Army Arduously Defends Yulin, Shortening the Defense Line and Abandoning Outposts Outside the City, Reinforcements Are on the Way and Will Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 30th Dispatch] The defense battle of Yulin in northern Shaanxi is becoming increasingly fierce. Communist bandits have gathered more than 30,000 people and have been building fortifications around the city for days. After the withdrawal from Shenmu, in order to concentrate its forces and shorten the defense line, the National Army has abandoned the outposts around Yulin and is firmly defending the city walls. In addition, two brigades of Communist bandits are scurrying through Yubei towards the Zhasak Banner of the Yimeng, seemingly to cut off the Bao-Yu traffic and plunder materials. The National Army reinforcements are on the way and will arrive soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baotou, 31st Dispatch] On the night of the 30th, the southeast corner of Yulin City was fiercely bombarded by the Communist bandits' artillery, and the positions around the Lingxiao Pagoda were destroyed. The defending army in the city is counterattacking on the 31st.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 31st Dispatch] Chairman Qiwu of Suiyuan Province told reporters: The gain or loss of Yulin is related to the safety of Suiyuan. Director Fu and the military and civilians of Chahar and Suiyuan are determined to make their best efforts to relieve Yulin.</p>
<p>(According to investigations, Zhang Zongxun, also known as Zongxun, who commanded the bandits attacking Yulin, is a Korean rogue. He met Zhang Zongchang in a gambling game when he was wandering in Harbin in his early years. They hit it off and became brothers. When Zhang Zongchang served as the military governor, he considered himself the military governor's brother and changed his name to Zhang Zongxun. He is good at Russian, and Zhang Zongchang's so-called "Maozi soldiers" were under his command. Later, when Zhang's power failed, he lived in Dalian. After the July 7th Incident, when Zhang Huanan first served as the puppet mayor of Yantai, he served as the guard captain, and later as the commander of the puppet Shandong Provincial Garrison Corps. He was cruel by nature. He once led the garrison corps (Yantai people called them "second devils") to the countryside, set fire to villages, and used machine guns to strafe the entrances of various villages. The villagers therefore called him "Zhang the Skinner." After the victory, he fled to the Communist bandits again. Now, he is leading bandits to attack Yulin in northern Shaanxi, which is also proof that the Korean Communists are participating in the internal unrest.)</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] Yulin was captured by the bandits on the 31st.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng on Universal Suffrage: Democratic Politics Requires Practical Learning; Hopes for Optimistic Cooperation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Wu Tiecheng, in his remarks to reporters today regarding his views on universal suffrage, stated that universal suffrage and party nominations are both first-time experiences for the people of our nation. Even if completely reasonable and legitimate outcomes cannot be achieved, the experience is still valuable.</p>
<p>Party nominations are a common practice in democratic countries, and campaigning is a normal right of the people in democratic nations. As for how to truly "select the virtuous and capable, uphold good faith, and cultivate harmony," all of this can be thoroughly tested in the election campaigns. Our countrymen often say that democratic politics must be learned in practice, just as swimming requires learning in the water; this is the same idea. If one dwells on signs of disputes and doubts the future of constitutional governance, is this not akin to ridiculing a child's clumsy steps? The nominations of our party are from the bottom up. Even if there are unfair aspects in the candidates proposed at the county and provincial levels, the central government still has the final power of review. However, with a limited number of positions, it is truly unavoidable that some talented individuals will be overlooked. If one considers this as unfair, it is not an equitable assessment. I deeply hope that people from all walks of life will view this first universal suffrage with optimism, cooperate with it, and jointly lay the initial foundation for constitutional governance.</p>

<h3>Editorial: Establishing a New Chinese Legal System</h3>
<p>The fourth annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Law will be held in this city today, and the President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, will personally preside over it. The convening of this annual meeting, gathering outstanding legal professionals from all over the country, is of great significance at this time of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. On the occasion of the opening of the meeting, in addition to congratulating the success of the meeting, we would like to briefly discuss the establishment of a new Chinese legal system:</p>
<p>First, the entire country is currently mobilized to suppress rebellion. When we examine the origin of the rebellion, the reasons are certainly not simple, but the lack of a spirit of abiding by the law among the Chinese people, which has damaged the dignity of the rule of law, is also one of the main reasons. All people in the country should absolutely abide by the laws of the country, without exception. In a country ruled by law, everyone should be under the law, and there should be no so-called "supra-legal" behavior. We have been compiling modern laws since the late Qing Dynasty, and the time has not been too short. How to implement the rule of law in the future is of great importance to the cause of national construction. We hope that the convening of this annual meeting can lead to practical and feasible decisions on how to establish a good foundation for vigorously implementing the rule of law.</p>
<p>Second, China has had its own contributions to jurisprudence since ancient times, forming a unique legal system. During the Tang Dynasty, the laws and regulations were strict and clear, and were praised by the world. In the last hundred years, due to frequent contact with foreign countries, our country began to accept some of the spirit of foreign laws and re-drafted our laws. Since the establishment of the Legislative Yuan, it has again revised our civil and criminal laws in accordance with the teachings of the founding father. The legislative spirit and the progress of legislative techniques have been praised by legal scholars around the world. However, many of our country's basic laws, especially in the area of social legislation, still need to be revised. We hope that these laws can be completed as soon as possible so that a legal system based on the Three Principles of the People can be established in time.</p>
<p>Third, speaking of the judiciary, in recent years, under the situation of high prices and turbulent life, judicial personnel throughout the country have been loyal to their duties and have won general praise. In terms of our judicial system, President Ju has also been constantly making improvements in order to adapt to the needs of the times. After the implementation of the Constitution in the future, the dignity of the judiciary will be further enhanced. The establishment of a legal system requires not only perfect legislation, but also enlightened justice. We admire how the precedents of the US Supreme Court have influenced the growth and education of American jurisprudence and believe in the importance of the position of judicial officers. In the establishment of a new Chinese legal system, we also hope that Chinese judicial organs can make the same contributions as those in Britain and America.</p>
<h3>The First Merchant's Day</h3>
<p>Merchant's Day is a brand new holiday. On this day last year, when the National Federation of Commerce and Industry held a meeting in the capital, the participating representatives believed that the National Federation of Commerce and Industry's meeting in the capital after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was of great significance, and resolved to designate the day the meeting was convened as Merchant's Day. The establishment of this holiday came from the initiative of the merchants. Although it has not yet been officially approved by the National Government, since the merchants have made this request for their own benefit, it seems that it can echo with the May Day Labor Day. Now, on the occasion of the first Merchant's Day, I would like to express my views as an encouragement.</p>
<p>Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants have been called the four classes of people since ancient times, but merchants have been particularly despised, said to be pursuers of trivial matters, and distributers rather than creators of wealth. Since the opening of maritime trade, thinking seems to have changed, but the exploitation by intermediaries, which increases the burden on consumers, remains a very deep and widespread impression; as if it were best for everything between producers and consumers to be direct, without the need for a third party to act as an intermediary.</p>
<p>Yes, the transfer of everything by these third parties does increase costs, thereby increasing the burden on users. Within the realm of what is possible, minimizing these transfers as much as possible, or using various cooperative organizations to reduce costs and prevent the outflow of benefits, is very reasonable and a very suitable disposition to the trend.</p>
<p>But then again, the existence of all commerce does not necessarily depend entirely on the one-sided requests of merchants, but rather on the needs of the majority of patrons. If this need does not exist, or if there is a slight need but the number is small, then no matter how much publicity, solicitation, decoration, and arrangement is done, the door will eventually be deserted, and it will be forced to close. On the contrary, even under strict laws and severe punishments, despite the high pressure from the government, they rise and fall, and sometimes they are still difficult to eliminate. This is because their supply of materials or services has its own indelible value. Moreover, in a modern society, the division of labor is increasingly detailed. Mencius in the Warring States period already said: "If everything that hundreds of artisans make must be prepared by one person, and only then can they be used, it is to lead the entire world on the road." In this era of commodity production, it is of course superfluous to artificially create separations between farmers, artisans, and merchants.</p>
<p>However, since the existence of commerce depends on the needs of society, how to meet this need, that is, how to reduce its price and improve its quality, and supply it in a timely manner, is an objective view to cater to the preferences of the general public, thereby strengthening its position, is a fundamental issue that merchants themselves urgently need to study. There are many outdated industries that cannot adapt to the times and keep up with the pace, resulting in being overshadowed and suffering natural elimination; this is entirely due to poor human planning and cannot be blamed on others.</p>
<p>Secondly, economic life is originally a part of the social form, and is closely related to other political, cultural and other parts, and can never be separated into two. After the Great War, the so-called free trade doctrine has already had only a remnant of breath and is no longer valued by the world; the economic policies of various countries, to some extent, have a flavor of government intervention or control, even Britain and the United States, which are known for advocating freedom, cannot avoid intervening in private economic life to some extent, let alone others? Since our country promulgated the Emergency Economic Measures Program last year, it has gradually embarked on this path of control again. Since the promulgation of the General Mobilization for Suppression of Rebellion this year, the need for control has become stronger. In this extraordinary period, all sectors of industry and commerce should face the facts of the present day. Comply with laws and regulations, and cooperate properly to comply with national policies. There are many contradictory, repetitive, biased and unreasonable places in the current laws and temporary measures, but before they are legally amended, whether it is to stand by and watch, refuse to cooperate, or comply superficially but defy secretly, intending to be opportunistic, or even willingly not care and violate laws and prohibitions, these are not attitudes that normal merchants should have. In the government, it is based on the general principle of the People's Livelihood, that when establishing various control programs, try to take into account the basic freedoms and rights that the people should enjoy, and be careful to visit and consult, and not act arbitrarily. But on the part of the merchants, when the steps are thorny and the difficulties are heavy, the merchants, while trying to solve the pain they are experiencing, must also consider the difficulties of the country. We deeply sympathize with the merchants' pain, and earnestly hope that the government will improve control, be generous, sympathize with the merchants' difficulties, and cultivate the strength of the people. At the same time, we must also hope that the general merchants will improve the sharpness of service, recognize the current situation, and be careful in their self-care, in order to reduce unnecessary disputes.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide Talks About Impressions of North China: The Common People Still Work Diligently; Despite Heavy Difficulties, Recovery Is Still Promising</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhou Yide began his press conference at 5:30 PM yesterday, speaking in Beiping dialect. He said: "I have lived in China for ten years, the first year in Nanjing, the next five years in Fujian, and the next four years in the West. So my Chinese has a Minbei accent. This time I came to China to conduct an inspection, originally scheduled to have five members of Congress, belonging to the Far East and Foreign Affairs Committees, but due to the special meeting of the US Congress on November 10 to discuss the aid to Europe issue, the other four were tied up with affairs in the United States."</p>
<p>One reporter asked him about his impressions of North China, and his answer was very unique: "The currency inflation, traffic destruction, and political incompetence in North China, if it were in the United States, it would really be a terrible thing, but the situation in China is another matter. The common people are still working vigorously and enduring pain. Everything is better than we thought in the United States. Therefore, I think that although China is currently facing heavy difficulties, it is not without hope, as long as there is a correct method, recovery is still promising."</p>
<p>This friend, who has consistently sympathized with China, was unwilling to reveal the contents of his future report to Congress, but he frankly explained that there are two points that he is particularly concerned with: "First, the general political and economic situation in China, because 70 percent of China's budget is used for military affairs, and the resources and strength of the entire country are also consumed in the war. We have to pay attention to the military situation. The second is propaganda work, today, propaganda has become a powerful weapon. Mussolini once said: 'The first time you lie, people don't believe it, but if you repeat it hundreds or thousands of times without change, people will go from doubt to belief.' Later Hitler, and now the Soviet Union, are faithful executors of this principle. Therefore, today the world is full of lies with propaganda effect."</p>
<h3>Both Policies are Attacked: America in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>Let's give some examples, such as America attempting to revive Japan; America hoping to control China; America wanting to launch a war against the Soviet Union; America wanting to support Germany to contain the Soviet Union. These are all lies that only consider the ends and disregard the means. Regarding Europe, if America stands idly by, we are accused of isolationism; if we actively assist, we are labeled as imperialists. It's truly laughable. In such circumstances, we must pay attention to propaganda. The best way to combat lies is to promote the truth. All those who believe in democracy and freedom should strive to promote these concepts."</p>
<p>He said that Japan has no hope of revival in fifty years. America's assistance to Japan is only to enable the Japanese to feed themselves, not to make them strong. Japan's future lies in China's hands. Without China's raw materials and market, Japan cannot sustain itself at all. The conversation naturally turned to American loans. The congressman said he could not answer this question, but he could say that the American people sympathize with China and are willing to do their best to help. The question is, what method should be adopted? He said, "As for myself, for the past two years, I have been advocating for aid to China, but unfortunately, out of the four hundred and fifty-three members of Congress, I am the only one who has been shouting loudly, and it has had no effect. Now, the overall situation in the East and West is changing. America has changed its policies in Greece, Turkey, Western Europe, and the UN General Assembly, and will be forced to do so in China in the future."</p>
<h3>Banning the Democratic League is Internal Affairs: Zhou Yide Says it is Inconvenient to Criticize</h3>
<p>The issue of the Democratic League was also raised. The congressman's answer was: "Some individuals in the Democratic League have engaged in pro-communist activities, but this is China's internal affair, and it is not convenient for me to criticize it." Zhou Yide's attitude is quite frank and clear. He said: "In China, you need to use your ears more." We hope that after he returns home, he can use his mouth more to eliminate all misunderstandings between China and the United States, and realize his wish that "China and the United States should continue to cooperate after the war as they did during the war."</p>

<h3>The Marshall Plan Encounters Considerable Resistance: The British Government Feels Deeply Uneasy; Cripps Says He No Longer Has Extravagant Hopes; Taft Once Again Criticizes Truman's Various Policies</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 30th] British Economic Minister Cripps stated at a press conference: Britain is prepared to be self-reliant if necessary, even if it cannot obtain American assistance. However, this will inevitably lead to a further reduction in food rations and a further lowering of the already declining living standards. He stated that the Labor government no longer has extravagant hopes for the Marshall Plan and other forms of American aid. The government is only considering aid from the Commonwealth. Cripps also stated: "We face the facts. We are doing our best to overcome our economic difficulties and are prepared to fight alone for several years if necessary. If the Marshall Plan cannot be implemented, we must seriously consider its impact on world development, especially on the development of Europe.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 30th] The Paris Sixteen-Nation Conference has completed its report on the discussion of the Marshall Plan. Although it has been four weeks since then, there is still no indication of what the final form of this aid plan will be. Therefore, officials in the United States and Europe are becoming increasingly impatient. What those who support the aid-to-Europe plan are most concerned about at present is that more and more people in the American political and business circles are opposing the Marshall Plan in view of the socialist trend in Europe. Senator Taft publicly stated that the proposed scale of assistance is unreasonable. It is clear that there is a growing trend in agreement with Taft's claim. Today's "Wall Street Journal" also stated that aiding Europe is one thing, but assisting several European governments that embrace bankrupt philosophies and are on the verge of collapse is another, which clearly implies opposition to aid to Europe.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 31st] Republican presidential candidate Taft declared that there is little hope for cooperation between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of dealing with price recovery and inflation at the upcoming special session of Congress. The Truman administration's various policies are not sound, and I cannot cooperate with them. Secretary of State Marshall and Undersecretary of State Lovett met with President Truman today, probably to make a final decision on the aid-to-Europe bill.</p>
<h3>American Attention Turns to the East: Eaton Emphasizes the Issue of American Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 30th] After weeks of focusing on Europe, American attention has now shifted eastward, and the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East has once again attracted attention. Just as the United States suffered a small defeat against the Soviet Union on the Korean issue in the United Nations, Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, met with United Press reporters in Washington on the 31st and issued a warning that the United States should not neglect Asia while assisting Western Europe. Eaton said that the United States "for the safety of itself and mankind" should immediately assume the responsibility of leading the world in all matters, and that both parties should implement a long-term cooperation policy to enable the United States to gain leadership. Eaton also said that he himself and the House Foreign Affairs Committee intend to seriously consider and extensively study the reports of Zhou Yide and other congressmen in China. Eaton concluded, "Our most urgent task is to gather our intelligence and establish principles in order to resolve our relations with China and the rest of the world. Only then can we decide how to implement these principles."</p>
<h3>The United Nations Small General Assembly Will Become an Investigative Body</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake, 30th] The fifteen-nation drafting group established by the UN General Assembly Political Committee to study the organizational law of the "Small General Assembly" decided today to grant the Assembly the power to investigate throughout the world, but subject to the following two restrictions: Investigative matters must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the representatives present at the Small General Assembly before they can proceed. Investigations outside the headquarters of the United Nations organization must first obtain the permission of the country being investigated. The group also decided that the Small General Assembly may discuss and study methods for maintaining peace and security during the recess of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Demands that the Allied Control Council for Germany Sever Relations with the Brazilian Mission: General Clay Refuses</h3>
<p>[United Press Berlin, 30th] General Clay, the American Commander-in-Chief in Germany, rejected the Soviet request on the 30th to sever relations between the Allied Control Council for Germany and the Brazilian military mission here, claiming that the Brazilian government's severing of relations with the Soviet Union was a "reactionary and anti-democratic" act. General Clay refused to detail Marshal Sokolovsky, the Soviet Commander-in-Chief's request, and defended the Brazilian people and government. Clay stated: He could not accept Mr. Sokolovsky's statement. As everyone knows, the Brazilian army fought side by side with the British and American armies in Italy, and this can be regarded as Brazil being an ally resisting the Axis powers. General Clay then requested that the entire issue be postponed for discussion at the next meeting on November 10.</p>
<h3>Korean Issue: Debate in the UN General Assembly Political Committee Results in Passage of the US Amendment: The Chinese Representative Supports the US Position</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake, 30th] After two days of debate, the 57-nation Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed the US proposal today by a vote of 41 to 0, inviting Korean representatives to participate in the debate on the issue of Korean unification, and the candidates will be elected under the supervision of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea.</p>
<p>This is regarded as an amendment to the original Soviet proposal. When put to a vote, it was rejected by 35 votes to 6, with 7 abstentions, excluding the Soviet Union and the six countries of the Slavic bloc. Soviet Representative Gromyko insisted on voting on the original proposal, which was rejected by 35 votes to 6, with 10 abstentions. Previously, the Soviet Union suggested that the US amendment be treated as a separate proposal and put to a vote, which was rejected by 43 votes to 6, with 4 abstentions. Ukraine's suggestion to shelve the US amendment was also rejected by 40 votes to 6, with 5 abstentions.</p>
<p>US Representative Dulles warned that the situation in Korea is extremely explosive, so the United Nations should consider supporting the plan for Korean independence as soon as possible. After the defeat, Gromyko immediately proposed to stop the discussion of the Korean issue. This suggestion was ultimately rejected. Chinese Representative Wei Jun spoke in support of the US amendment.</p>
<h3>Indian Representative Advocates Expanding the Authority of the UN Commission on Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake, 30th] The Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly decided on the 30th to formally submit a proposal to the Political Committee, advocating that the "observational" authority of the United Nations Commission on Korea be expanded to "supervisory." The Indian delegation made this decision after meeting with representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada and obtaining assurances from the three countries that they would support its proposal in principle.</p>
<h3>US Government Sues Seventeen Banks: Accused of Monopolizing the Securities Market</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 30th] On the 30th, the US government sued Wall Street bankers for conspiring to monopolize the financing of American industry. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against seventeen leading investment banking firms and the Investment Bankers Association of America under the Anti-Trust Act. The accusation is that the firms conspired to restrict competition in the trading of securities stocks. They issue securities, which investors buy themselves, and then sell the securities. The US government claims that this method is unreasonable, and the price, conditions, and circumstances under which the public purchases stocks are restricted. Attorney General Clark said that this lawsuit is one of the most important actions he has taken since the establishment of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Morgan Company is also one of the defendants.</p>
<h3>Mendi Faces Difficulties Under Attack from Both Left and Right: The French Cabinet Gains a Vote of Confidence: The Government Adopts a Middle Road to Prevent National Division</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 30th] The French National Assembly cast a vote of confidence in Ramadier's united cabinet, which adopted a middle road, on the night of the 31st, gaining only a narrow majority. In this way, the French cabinet can avoid collapsing under the combined attack of the Communist Party and the anti-communist French People's League led by de Gaulle, the wartime leader of Free France. The vote of confidence in the government passed by a majority of 300 to 280 (18 abstentions).</p>
<p>The National Assembly began voting at 6:45 pm on the 30th. The parties voted according to the instructions given by their leaders earlier. Ramadier, emotionally agitated, issued a shocking appeal before the vote, asking for clear trust and support for the government to avoid the division of France. He said: "We ask those who are loyal to France and the Republic to cast a vote of confidence in the government, and those who oppose France or are hesitant should cast a vote of no confidence in us, because the worst possible situation still exists, that is, whether France will be split into a pro-Soviet camp or a pro-American camp, or whether France will cooperate with all countries with its free will." Ramadier also responded to de Gaulle's request to hold a referendum, saying: "This is whether we will use the referendum to overthrow the parliament." When Speaker Herriot announced the opening of the meeting, two-thirds of the gallery was full. This was the seventh time that Ramadier had asked the parliament for confidence, and undoubtedly also the most dangerous. The Communist Party, the far-right parties, and the Republican Liberty Party voted against it, while the Popular Republican Movement voted for it.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 31st] Most members of the French National Assembly and those who sympathize with the government declared today that the Ramadier cabinet will be forced to reorganize again within a month, so that Socialist provincial veterans such as former Prime Minister Blum can join the cabinet.</p>
<h3>Syrian Army Holds Large-Scale Exercises on the Holy Land Border</h3>
<p>[United Press Syrian Capital, 31st] The government announced today that the Syrian army will hold exercises near Al-Qunaytra and Banias on the Palestinian border tomorrow. The scale will be unprecedented. President Quwatli will preside over the exercises in person.</p>
<h3>The Total Preliminary Allied Claims for Japanese Reparations Reach 54 Billion US Dollars: China's Claims Account for 40% of the Total</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 30th] The total preliminary allied claims for Japanese reparations from the eleven Pacific allies are estimated at approximately 54 billion US dollars, according to one-sided estimates. A responsible person said that China's claims to the Far Eastern Commission here are the highest, accounting for 40% of the total. Based on the Philippines' official claim for 4.1 billion yuan in compensation and its request to obtain 15% of all reparations, China's claim is estimated to be approximately 12 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Commission also announced that efforts to reduce the demands of various countries over the past eight days have failed to reach an agreement. The total amount of reparations from Germany and Japan must be determined by the final peace treaty. The Soviet Union's claims for reparations from Germany are approximately 10 billion yuan, and its claims for reparations from Japan are approximately 3.3 billion yuan. The total amount of Japanese reparations has not been announced, but based on percentages, it is approximately 14 billion yuan. The percentages of other countries' claims are as follows: Australia 28, Canada 1.5, France 12, India 12.5, Netherlands 12, New Zealand 2, United Kingdom 25, United States 28. The United States has abandoned any claims for factories that have already been allocated, but retains the right to speak on the allocation of major reparations in the future. The eleven countries that directly fought Japan initially proposed their respective proportions of compensation and the proportions they believed other countries should receive. As a result, the total proportion that each country should receive was 204.5%, while the proportion that other countries should receive was only 92%. Since the negotiations in February of this year, the initial proportion has been reduced to 189%. The final agreement on the total amount of reparations and the method of distribution should be included in the peace treaty with Japan. The United States proposed convening a preliminary meeting of the eleven countries to negotiate the peace treaty with Japan, but it was called off due to the Soviet Union's firm opposition. The Soviet Union advocated that the four major powers should preside over the meeting. Philippine Representative Romulo urged the countries with veto power to avoid using their privileges, and said that every day the issue of compensation is delayed, the existing Japanese equipment will be damaged.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Adjourns</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 30th] After the Ramadier-led coalition cabinet gained a vote of confidence from the parliament, the National Assembly passed a motion to adjourn until November 13, the original date for the parliament's autumn session to reconvene, giving the Ramadier cabinet a two-week period of stability.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Occupies Austrian Oil Fields: The United States Protests Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Washington, 30th] The US State Department announced today that the United States has once again protested to the Soviet Union over the Soviet Union's occupation of the Anglo-American-owned Laba refinery in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria. This note from the US to the Soviet Union is a continuation of the British and American protest issued in August of this year. This note refutes the Soviet Union's claim that the refinery should be allocated for reparations, stating that the occupation of the refinery constitutes an infringement on the property rights of American citizens. The oil industry is one of the main compensation points in the draft Austrian peace treaty drawn up by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Greek Deputy Prime Minister Arrives in the UK to Discuss Forming a Mediterranean Group</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 31st] Greek Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris arrived here from New York on the 31st and intends to contact the British Foreign Office. Diplomats speculate that Tsaldaris will seek cooperation with Italy to form a Mediterranean group. When Tsaldaris talks with Foreign Minister Bevin, he will discuss the situation in northern Greece, the difficulties of the British army's withdrawal, and even the issue of Greek tobacco being shipped to the UK.</p>
<h3>The Philippines Discriminates Against Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Manila, 31st] According to the resolution of the Philippine Industrial Relations Court last night, the employment of non-Filipino workers is not encouraged. The court is currently dealing with the issue of Filipino workers' strikes at the sawmill of a large Chinese timber company here.</p>
<p>[United Press Manila, 31st] The Philippine Constabulary also arrested eighteen Chinese people who had illegally entered the country near Caurimo Port on the northwest coast of Luzon Island.</p>

<p>[This Newspaper] The fourth session of the first Shanghai Municipal Senate Assembly was extended for one month from September 30 because the municipal budget for the 37th year could not be reviewed in time, and resumed yesterday. The eighth meeting was held yesterday morning at the assembly's Tanggu Road address, and the ninth meeting was held in the afternoon. The 25 motions that had been reviewed but not discussed were first sent to the competent authorities for execution in accordance with the resolution of the seventh meeting, and were ratified yesterday at the eighth meeting. In addition, many other motions were discussed and passed. Today's meeting will discuss the municipal budget for the 37th year, the draft contract for the operating rights of the United Electric Power Company, and the three winter relief fund-raising bills proposed by the Winter Relief Committee: issuing lottery tickets, adding 20% entertainment tax, and horse racing to support racing. If the discussion goes smoothly, the fourth assembly is expected to end its recess this evening.</p>
<p>The motions discussed at yesterday's meeting are as follows: Legal and Regulatory Motions: A motion suggesting that the central government earnestly eliminate redundant staff, eliminate the evil atmosphere of corruption, and promote the personnel system was resolved by the assembly to suggest to the central government: (A) Regarding livelihood: The salaries of civil servants should be issued uniformly according to the cost of living index based on the base salary. All living allowances and in-kind distributions should be abolished. (B) Regarding the elimination of redundant staff: The number of personnel and affairs can only be reduced and not increased. The personnel reduced as a result should be allocated and employed in newly planned careers. (C) Regarding the elimination of corruption: Reward whistleblowers, and exempt those who have been forced to offer bribes from punishment if they confess and expose the crime. (D) Regarding the personnel system: Civil servants should be uniformly guaranteed. Unless there is a fault, the supervisor shall not arbitrarily change them. Those who have passed the examination and appraisal or selection and have not yet been appointed shall be distributed for appointment uniformly. Incumbent civil servants who have not been evaluated and appointed should be gradually eliminated. A resolution was made to request the municipal government to send a letter to the Ministry of Justice to instruct various courts to strive for the speedy investigation and trial of criminal suspects, so as to avoid innocent people suffering the pain of long-term detention, and to quickly formulate unjust imprisonment compensation. It is also recommended that the Legislative Yuan formulate unjust imprisonment compensation law as soon as possible. A resolution was made to organize a delegation to visit various prisons in the city to understand the lives of inmates and facilitate improvement. A resolution was made that the handling of labor-management disputes should be the responsibility of the Social Affairs Bureau. Other military, police, and gendarmerie agencies may only assist and may not overstep their authority.</p>
<p>Civil Affairs: It was resolved to organize a district administration visiting group to conduct visits to understand the general situation of work in each district and suggest improvements to the government.</p>
<h3>Business Tax for Manufacturing Industry: Request for Half-Rate Collection</h3>
<p>Financial Motions: A motion requesting that it be clearly stipulated that ship donations shall not be collected in a different place, that is, the tax should not be collected elsewhere, was resolved to send a letter to the municipal government stating that the tax should not be collected again. However, berthing fees should still be paid in accordance with regulations. A motion requesting the Finance Bureau to reduce the business tax for the manufacturing industry by half was resolved to 1. Request the central government to interpret the scope of the manufacturing industry related to national defense and people's livelihood. 2. The implementation date shall be from the time of collecting the autumn business tax. 3. Forward a letter to the municipal government ordering the Finance Bureau to handle it. A motion requesting a reduction in the tax rate on profits earned by shops in the suburbs of the city was resolved to pass.</p>

<h3>Judge Reviews Confession: Zhang Chunfan Not Interrogated Yesterday; Leng Shan Stated at the Police Bureau That His Relationship with Xiao Ling Was Just Ordinary Friendship</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Chunfan, manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theatre, was detained on suspicion of being involved in the suicide case of Xiao Dangui and is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. Prosecutor Chen Shoutao was busy reviewing the confession and other documents sent by the police bureau. He originally intended to interrogate Zhang yesterday, but because he had not finished reading them, the interrogation was postponed. As for Leng Shan's written record at the police bureau, the main points are as follows: "Leng Shan's real name is Jin Zhaoyuan, 30 years old, from Suzhou, and works in film. Because he was a director at Guotai, he got to know Xiao Dangui. It was just ordinary friendship. Although Xiao and I exchanged letters, they were all about reviewing the art of acting and nothing else. They were just ordinary letters, so they have been lost. A few days ago, Xiao Dangui called and asked me to watch a movie at the Dahua that afternoon at 8:00 PM. We met at Dahua. Since it was still early before the movie started, we hired a car to go to Zhaofeng Park. After getting out of the car, we walked a few steps and turned back. We walked and talked. We walked to Daxilu Jing'an Temple Road and parted ways. It was already past 10:00 PM. At 6:00 PM on the 8th, Zhang and others came to find me there. Zhang told Xiao Dangui not to speak and let me confess, saying that watching movies and strolling on the street were also ordinary things. Zhang was furious and said, 'You ordinary, I not ordinary,' and reached out and hit me in the face, knocking off my glasses. After being persuaded by others, Zhang said again, 'If you really haven't opened a room with Xiao, kneel down and swear an oath.' When I left, I said, 'If I have caused discord between you and your wife, I will never see Xiao again.' As for why Xiao Ling committed suicide, I don't know the reason. I haven't seen Xiao since the confrontation." Wang Qianyun, Xiao Dangui's sister, testified at the police bureau, "My sister is usually quiet. She has lived with Zhang for seven years, but she has no children. I go to her place to play every morning and evening, and we only talk about family matters and nothing else. My sister and Zhang divide their finances clearly. My sister is very frugal and often copies and reads scripts. Her relationship with Zhang is very good and they have lived together until now, and they have never quarreled. On the 8th, I heard people say that my sister watched a movie with a man and was questioned by Zhang. I wasn't there, so I don't know the details. On the afternoon of the 9th, I went to my sister's place and saw Zhang, Leng Shan, and Mr. Wu talking behind closed doors. I don't know what they were talking about. After that, I often saw my sister crying, but she still went to Guotai to play, as if nothing had happened. On the 13th, I came out of the Narcissus room on the upper floor of the Zhedong Building and walked past my sister's door. I saw my sister sitting cross-legged on the bed, writing on the bedding with her finger or pen. I didn't pay attention to what she was writing. Soon I heard Wei shouting in my sister's room, 'What's wrong, Chunfengmei (Xiao Dangui)!' I immediately entered my sister's room and saw Zhang hugging my sister and asking, 'What's wrong, Chunfeng? What's wrong, Chunfeng?' Then she was sent to the hospital, but she died. I don't know the rest of the situation. My sister doesn't owe any debts and her relationship with Zhang is good. However, a corner of the Guotai Theatre collapsed, the house in the countryside was burned down, and the house bought in Hangzhou was occupied by others. She was often depressed about it."</p>

<h3>Two Lives Ended Together: A Tragedy Occurs at the Tianjin Beiyang Hotel - Unmarried Couple Peacefully Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>[Report from Tianjin, 28th by our correspondent] At noon on the 28th, a tragic case of suicide was discovered in room 359 of the Beiyang Hotel in Tianjin. A young, unmarried couple was found to have committed suicide by poison. They died in each other's arms, with the woman's head resting on the man's right arm.</p>
<p>The room where the tragedy occurred was located on the northeastern corner of the upper floor. The room had windows facing east and north. The north window was covered with a yellow floral curtain. Inside the room, there was a wardrobe, a washbasin, a dressing table, a square table, and a coffee table. A brass bed was placed against the wall, and the suicidal young couple lay on it. The man was lying on the inner side of the bed, wearing a white cloth short jacket and white cloth trousers. The woman was wearing a white shirt and white trousers, with a light blue jacket over her upper body, and her head resting on the man's right arm. There was no sign of struggle or pain on their faces. They seemed to have lost consciousness peacefully, bidding farewell to the human world. According to the bellboy of the Beiyang Hotel:</p>
<p>The young couple checked into the room at 2:00 PM on the 27th. The names registered on the guest book were Sai Qinglong and Dong Yanqing, both 23 years old, from Shenyang, and their occupation was listed as Xinyuan Bank. After checking in, the two went out together and returned late at night. After returning, they borrowed pen and ink from the bellboy to write a letter, then went out to mail the letter in the mailbox at the entrance of the hotel. Afterwards, they asked the bellboy for hot water and then closed the door and went to sleep. At noon on the 28th, the bellboy on duty patrolled the rooms and discovered that the young couple was lying motionless on the bed.</p>
<p>An autopsy revealed that Sai Qinglong's gums, lips, and the soles of his feet were all blue, and blue spots were found all over his body.</p>
<p>Dong's condition was exactly the same, with a small amount of white powder still in her mouth. A five-hundred-yuan bill was found on the coffee table in front of the bed, with some white powder residue on it. There was also one and a half copies of the "Wantongding" leaflet from the Tianjin Dasheng Pharmaceutical Company, with the words "anesthetic" written on the back. The examiner determined that the deceased had died from taking a large amount of anesthetic.</p>
<p>According to the identity cards of the deceased: the man's name was indeed Sai Qinglong, also known as Sai Yichang, from Tianjin. The woman's name was Dong Jifeng, 23 years old, from Yingkou, currently residing at No. 5 Jixing South Lane, Baoji Road, Tianjin. Sai Qinglong used to work for the Third Training Team of the United Logistics Headquarters but had since left and had no current occupation. He lived with his half-brother Sai Minglu at a friend's house. He and Dong Jifeng had fallen in love through friendship and had gotten engaged on June 2nd of this year. Dong Jifeng had previously studied at Tianjin Tianshen Middle School and had worked as an elementary school teacher. The two usually had a very harmonious relationship. Sai Mingxuan said: Sai Qinglong lost his job shortly after getting engaged, and they could not get married early. This may be the reason for their suicide. Dong Jifeng had elderly parents, two younger sisters, and a younger brother. According to her sister, Dong Jifeng usually said: "Sai Yili is my burden." On the morning of the 27th, she told her mother that she was going to her second sister-in-law's place in Hedong and asked her for two thousand yuan for transportation. She also asked her sister for ten thousand yuan, saying that she was going to Nankai. Unexpectedly, she did not return that night, and the next day, this tragedy occurred. The police found a torn red letter in Dong Jifeng's pocket, which read: "To my beloved parents: This time, I never thought..." It can be inferred that the letter mailed by the deceased before the suicide may have been sent to Dong Jifeng's home. The reason for this suicide may be explained in the letter itself, waiting for the recipient to receive it and make everything clear. (Reporter: Li Shaolin)</p>
<h3>Another Corpse in a Trunk Case Appears in Tianjin After the Suicide of the Unmarried Couple</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 31st] A shocking case of a corpse in a trunk has recently been discovered in Tianjin. The murderer, Li Baowu, is the manager of the Tianjin Zhongda Electric Factory and one of the major shareholders of Qixin Cement Company.

In order to cover up the crime, Li and Shi Meili worked together to saw off Dong's head and legs and burned Dong's head to disfigure her. Then, they put the body into a wicker trunk and deposited it with Li's foreign friend, Rui Le, on the 26th. The next day, he bought a large wooden box and packed the wicker trunk inside the wooden box. Rui Le noticed something was wrong and reported it to the police. After an investigation, the case was solved.</p>

<h3>Public Inspection of the Masses</h3>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai, is carrying out a general inspection of the membership certificates of its members. Those whose certificates have been canceled and have not yet reapplied should quickly go through the reapplication procedures. Those who have already submitted their certificates for inspection but have not yet received them should quickly retrieve them and pay the fees.</p>
<h3>Construction of the Chamber of Commerce Building</h3>
<p>The grand plan to construct a monumental building for the Chamber of Commerce, costing hundreds of millions of yuan and taking considerable time, is a matter of great international significance and a source of honor for our Chamber of Commerce. The initial planning and continued efforts have built upon the foundation laid by previous administrations. Fundraising efforts have been extensive, and progress has been commendable. A final decision has been made to complete the fundraising process, reflecting the unwavering commitment of all members. However, a sudden cessation of operations, accompanied by loud noises and disruptions, would render the efforts of the entire chamber meaningless. The current Chairman and all committee members have made special visits and carefully considered how to continue fundraising. Although the current market prices are difficult, our commitment to raising hundreds of millions of yuan remains unchanged. The immediate challenge is to address the financial shortfall. The construction project is intimately linked to the reputation and future development of our Chamber of Commerce. The splendid building will showcase the spirit of international cooperation. The continuation of this undertaking, the establishment of palaces, pavilions, association halls, the formation of new guest houses, and the celebration of great occasions are all interconnected. The planning and construction should align with the collective will of the members, ensuring that the construction of the Chamber of Commerce building achieves a success that is both celebrated and admired. The legacy should be passed down through generations. The resolution to unite and forge ahead was affirmed by the general committee meeting, showing a commitment to the overall advancement of the project.</p>

<h3>Export Promotion of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Made from Uncertified Imported Raw Cotton by the China Trust Bureau, Assisting Private Factories to Compete in the International Market</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau previously purchased uncertified imported raw cotton upon arrival at the port and entrusted it to renowned yarn factories for spinning. This is expected to be fully completed within this month and has entered the export phase according to the original plan. Besides the export of cotton yarn, most of it is exchanged for cotton cloth for export, and a small portion is exchanged for cotton textiles such as undershirts, towels, and绒毯. For the cotton cloth portion, in addition to the China Textile Construction Corporation's weaving of cloth which is contracted to be shipped to Manila in September, October, and November for a total of 150,000 bolts, the remaining will be handled by the China Trust Bureau for export. In June, contracts have already been signed for 187,100 bolts, all of which are exported by private yarn factories, including 30,000 bolts of Zhong brand sheeting, 55,000 bolts of Sipingyun sheeting, 33,000 bolts of Fugui sheeting, 2,500 bolts of Dapeng sheeting, 15,600 bolts of ABC sheeting, 4,800 bolts of Jingxi printed cloth, 50,000 bolts of Qinliangyu bleached cloth, and 6,200 bolts of Xinguang shirt poplin, totaling 172,100 bolts. There are also 1,980 bales of cotton yarn, including 300 bales of Zhong brand 21-count yarn, 150 bales of Jixiang 21-count yarn, 100 bales of Haozuo brand 21-count yarn, 200 bales of Xipai brand 20-count yarn, 880 bales of Shuangma 21-count yarn, 300 bales of Tiannv 20-count yarn, and 50 bales of 42-count yarn. The quality of the yarn and cloth from the above-mentioned private factories is excellent. However, due to domestic costs being higher than foreign selling prices, the factories are unable to export on their own. Furthermore, their brands mostly lack a foundation in foreign markets. This time, the China Trust Bureau is doing its best to promote sales for the private factories to foreign countries, allowing the yarn and cloth produced by the private factories to gain a foothold in the international market under their own brands. In the future, they can gradually expand and compete with other countries, even with the Japanese textile industry. Therefore, the China Trust Bureau's handling of yarn and cloth exports is of great significance, not only generating foreign exchange for the government but also supporting private enterprises and opening a path for private textile exports. With the establishment of the Textile Export Committee, the China Trust Bureau has stated that if progress is smooth, there is hope for even greater exports of yarn and cloth spun from the aforementioned uncertified imported raw cotton in November. According to statistics, the China Trust Bureau's export regions include Hong Kong, Rome, Aden, Basra, the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Batavia, Singapore, and Manila.</p>
<h3>Further Increase in Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices, Active Yarn and Cloth Market, Smooth Sales of Fine Yarn with Price Rebound</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Price Adjustment Committee (紡調會) adjusted cotton yarn prices again yesterday, raising the negotiated price for 20-count yarn to 19.85 million yuan, an increase of 950,000 yuan. Prices for other counts of yarn were also calculated separately according to the ratio and market conditions.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 868 bales, with 1,334.5 bales of 20-count yarn. All were sold to manufacturers, with 246 applicants.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market sentiment shifted from weary to firm, with active buyers and a sudden improvement in the market. Fine yarn sales were particularly brisk, resulting in a rebound of 900,000 yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn compared to the previous day, reaching 33.5 million yuan. Prices for other counts of coarse and fine yarn varied by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan up or down.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market had been hovering for many days, and most floating inventories had been cleared. Strong buyers, seeing low prices, were searching for goods, and with the increase in negotiated prices for China Textile Construction Corporation cotton yarn, market sentiment suddenly became firm and bullish, with new buyers also active. Finally, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths rebounded by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen Drill (四君子嗶嘰) purchases by Cantonese dealers rose by 25,000 yuan, and most other cloth markets also became firmer.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Remains Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday, raw cotton transactions were sparse, and the market was lackluster. Yarn factories still had intentions to buy, but prices were not high, leading to stalled transactions. Dealers had slight interest, but transactions were not active. Market prices were the same as the previous day, with a total of 830 bales transacted. Factory delivery prices only opened for one transaction, with Hankou Grade 2 at 2.81 million yuan. Warehouse delivery prices opened at 3.76 million yuan for Lingbao, 2.98 million yuan for Guide, 3.24 million yuan for Qidong, 3.59 million yuan for Shashi, and 330 bales of Hankou fine cotton. Huo Ji opened at 2.5 million yuan and 2.56 million yuan, and Zhoupu cottonseed cotton was at 596,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Hovers, Flour Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 11,400 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Stores were more willing to purchase, and the market was slightly more active. Japonica and Indica round-grained rice both rose by 10,000 yuan, reaching over 10,000 yuan. Yin Yuan (陰元) also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with very small fluctuations, entering a hovering pattern. Flour sales were slow, returning to a weak state, falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish in rural areas, plunging by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cakes purchased in Shantou increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories opportunistically picked up goods, and local purchases continued, with a firm market. Mung beans continued to be cleared in Nanyang, advancing by 10,000 yuan. Red beans were actively purchased by Cantonese dealers, with a firm market. Broad beans were sluggish, continuing to fall by 10,000 yuan. Cowpea oil dealers were eager to buy, raising prices by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sorghum arrivals continued to increase, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn from the North Sea moved but was not active, with a stable market. Sesame transactions were lively in the local market. Oil factories were quick to clear goods, with high-grade goods rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per day, and medium and low grades also rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were unchanged in the foreign market, with local interest still high, remaining strong.</p>
<p>The oil market was mixed, with crude oil continuing to fall by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan due to a large arrival from Jiangbei. Soybean oil, however, had active sales and rebounded by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil rose by varying amounts from 10,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Mediocre</h3>
<p>Government bonds were more stable yesterday, with offers for 555 and 628 series. The 503, 552, and 360 series all advanced. The C series opened at 21,600 yuan, rising from 21,400 yuan to 22,800 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, A and B series were mostly flat compared to the previous close, C series rose by 400 yuan, D series gained 600 yuan, and E series rose by 500 yuan, with a turnover of approximately 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were mediocre and little changed yesterday. Hong Kong-Shanghai Electric rebounded to around 6.5 yuan. Mature stocks rose slightly after reaching high prices. Ewo Yarns opened at 191,000 yuan, with a low of 190,000 yuan, reaching a high of 197,000 yuan in the middle, but still returned to the initial price at the close in the afternoon. Securities dealers were selling, while foreign merchants were buying. As a result, compared to the previous close, shipping fell by half a percent, plantations rose by half a percent, British-American Tobacco and Jardine Matheson Telephones rose slightly, while paper and Ewo Brewery fell slightly. Real Estate and Ewo Yarns were mostly flat.</p>
<h3>Firm Domestic Tea Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the tea market, negotiations between exporters and owners for export grades were still not smooth, resulting in an inactive market. However, domestic teas still saw strong purchasing interest from local stores and trading houses, leading to a continued increase in sales volume. Prices were also firmly supported by domestic buyers, showing consistent strength. In particular, this year's Qimen black tea and Ping Shui flag guns (平水旗槍) were less affected by the lower inventories, and the price increase continued unabated throughout the day, resulting in price increases ranging from 200,000-300,000 yuan to 500,000-600,000 yuan. It was also learned that the Changzhou area was actively purchasing low-grade Qimen black tea.</p>
<h3>Numerous Applications from Manufacturers for Imported Raw Materials for Straw Hats</h3>
<p>The Export Management Committee (輸管會) has submitted the import methods for raw materials used in manufacturing export products to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Committee, considering the seasonal nature of the two straw hat materials, gold silk and thatch, has decided to handle them first. It is reported that since the Export Promotion Division (輸出推廣處) of the Committee began handling the matter last week, the progress has been excellent. As of now, more than 30 applications have been received. All straw hat merchants have been able to comply with the regulations, securing guarantees from designated banks to ensure that after the import of these raw materials and the export of the finished straw hats, each US dollar's worth of raw materials will generate 3-6 US dollars in export revenue, without depleting the country's foreign exchange reserves. After reviewing each application, the Committee will send it to the Non-Quota Review Department (非限額審核處) to issue an import permit. The merchants will then go to Manila to purchase raw materials and manufacture straw hats. It is estimated that exports can begin in two months. Before the war, these exports were valued at approximately 2 million US dollars annually. Unofficial estimates indicate that they can also generate 2 million US dollars this time, restoring pre-war performance. The straw hat production areas in China are Haimen and Yuyao in Zhejiang Province, and Changshu in Jiangsu Province. These are all rural side industries, with very delicate craftsmanship that is popular among European and American women, so sales are not a problem.</p>
<h3>Buying Sentiment Difficult to Sustain; Chinese Stocks Fall After Initial Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major securities firms showed buying interest in Chinese stocks, buoyed by the encouragement of reduced margin requirements. However, the market still felt isolated and lacked widespread participation. Although there was a temporary rally mid-session, it proved difficult to sustain. The afternoon release of the cost of living index fueled underlying concerns, and sellers seized the opportunity to suppress buying sentiment, leading to a gradual decline after the initial surge.</p>
<p>Morning Session</p>
<p>The market initially felt somewhat subdued due to loan-related news. However, the report of reduced margin requirements sparked renewed activity, leading to higher opening prices. Wing On Textiles opened steadily around 283 yuan, with forward contracts rising from 292 yuan to 294 yuan. Subsequently, it retreated to 279 yuan and 289 yuan before rising again to 284 yuan and 294 yuan. Trading volume remained light, and speculative fervor was not high. Consequently, although off-market interest rates opened lower at 1.5 fen and 1.95 fen, the market remained range-bound with little significant change. It then rose again to 285 yuan and 296 yuan. With supply readily available for immediate delivery, those settling forward contracts slightly lowered their bids. News of the opening of the Tianjin Stock Exchange and the entry of banking groups provided a boost, driving the market higher by midday to 289 yuan for immediate delivery and breaking the 300 yuan mark for forward contracts. Guangdong firms offered shares, and Jardine Matheson also sold immediate delivery contracts, further contributing to the market's pullback. The midday close was 288 yuan and 298 yuan. China United led the gains, followed by China Silk, Sino-French, and China General Edison. Most popular stocks remained stable. Compared to the previous closing prices, immediate delivery stocks generally rose by 10%, while Sino-French, China Silk, and China General Edison rose by 5%. China Textile, China Xingye, Match, Lihua, and Xinyi remained flat. National Goods experienced a slight decline. Most other stocks rose slightly, with forward contracts showing a rise of about 5% for Xinhua and China Merchants Union, while others rose only marginally.</p>
<h3>Deposit and Reserve Amounts of Banks and Financial Institutions in This City for September</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to a report released by the Auditing Department of the Central Bank, a comparison of the total deposit and reserve amounts of various banks and financial institutions in this city for September of this year shows that the total deposit amount was 1,468,623,653.627 yuan, of which 1,343,147,471.858 yuan was demand deposits and 125,146,181.768 yuan was time deposits. The total amount of paid-in reserves was 214,127,502.131 yuan, which is comparable to the amounts for August.</p>
<h3>Rayon Recovers; Silk Goods from Factories Sell Well</h3>
<p>After consecutive days of fatigue, rayon rebounded yesterday. In the morning, 120 denier "Asahi" brand rayon opened steadily. However, due to strong buying interest from various parties, prices rose steadily, with the highest bid reaching 82 million yuan. At the midday close, prices retreated to 80.3 million yuan. The afternoon session was slightly weaker, with the final selling price at 79 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Silk</p>
<p>The market was quite active yesterday, with silk goods selling very well. Transaction prices were significantly higher than the previous day, rising by 1 million yuan. Grade C, five-bale lots were priced at 65 million yuan, 3 million yuan higher per bale. Medium-grade silk was 1.5 million to 2 million yuan higher per bale. Raw silk sales were relatively sluggish, and prices were also higher than the previous day. Top-grade raw silk traded at 43 million to 44 million yuan per bale.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session</p>
<p>Wing On Textiles once reached highs of 293 yuan and 301 yuan. However, due to concerns about the rising cost of living index and talk of panic among textile mills, selling pressure emerged, and buyers became hesitant. Unfavorable exchange rates further pushed prices down to lows of 281 yuan and 289 yuan for immediate delivery. Immediate delivery prices then rose slightly to 283 yuan, while forward contracts closed at 289 yuan. Popular stocks experienced slight declines, while miscellaneous stocks remained stable. In particular, New Asia, with limited trading volume, jumped significantly. Compared to the previous close, only New Asia immediate delivery shares rose by 10%, while China Textile, Innerwear, King Fung, Match experienced moderate increases. China General Edison, Anheng remained flat. Wing On Textiles, Xinyi, Le Xing, Meiya, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, towels, Sino-French, Xinhua, Huaxin, Xinyi, China Silk, Rong Kang all experienced small declines. Among forward delivery stocks, Wing On Textiles, Xinyi, Meiya, Jingfu, and Qinxing experienced slight declines, with Xinguang falling slightly less than half a percent. Outside of these, old stocks, including Chinese Merchant Securities, had favorable news. Bank stocks were heavily sought after by major investors, and news of cultural stocks being listed also led to gains.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was brisk due to rising raw material costs. Silk quilt covers from Dashunxing and Huaqiang opened around 2.4 million yuan, then rose to around 2.45 million yuan, briefly surging to an immediate price of 2.6 million yuan. Ultimately, due to sustained buying interest, prices soared to over 2.7 million yuan, with some buying at 2.9 million yuan for next-day delivery. The rising cost of living index inevitably increased the cost of silk goods, leading to positive sentiment. Other goods also remained firm.</p>
<h3>Fourth Quarter Import Quotas Postponed to Next Week</h3>
<p>The third-quarter quotas of the Import and Export Management Committee expired yesterday. The fourth-quarter import quotas were scheduled to be announced this morning. However, because the National Economic Council has not yet finalized the figures for the fourth-quarter quotas, the announcement cannot be made this morning and will be postponed until next week.</p>
<p>Although the Committee's third-quarter quotas have expired, most have not yet been allocated. In addition, some of the first and second-quarter quotas have not yet been fully allocated. Therefore, the Committee is currently strengthening its allocation efforts. The delayed announcement of the fourth-quarter quotas will have no impact on the situation.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants in Various Regions Plan to Form a Federation</h3>
<p>The national cotton industry trade association has designated the trade associations in Nantong, Hankou, Shashi, and Shanghai as initiators to prepare for and promote industry participation in order to consolidate the organization of the national cotton merchant trade association, seek to expand the industry's business, and promote the welfare of the industry. It is reported that the local side has designated Liu Ping-sun, Zhang Qiliang, Tang Shuming, Shi Cheng-sun, and twelve others as preparatory committee members, and representatives from various regions will also arrive in Shanghai within days to jointly discuss preparatory matters and register with the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is expected that the association will be officially established in December.</p>
<h3>Overcoating Fabric Prices Rise Again</h3>

<p>The Industrial Loan Review Committee of the National Bank Discount Committee held its 30th meeting yesterday, reviewing 38 industrial loan applications and approving 29 applications, totaling 8.56 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The domestic medicine market was slightly more active in the past two days. Rehmannia glutinosa and Achyranthes bidentata have been affected by the war, and the supply has been cut off, resulting in demand exceeding supply. 16-count Rehmannia glutinosa suddenly jumped to 16,000 yuan, and small Rehmannia glutinosa to 9,000 yuan. The market is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was strong. Ten-pack "Taiying Old Knife" rose by 500,000 yuan to 4.7 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other Chinese and foreign brand cigarettes and fifty-pack canned "Men" also rose by 1,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The wood market is slightly firmer, as sales have loosened and buyers are taking advantage of lower prices.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Journalist Mr. Yu Songhua</h3>
<p>— Lü Zhu</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Songhua, a senior figure in journalism, passed away in Suzhou on October 11. The news of his death has caused grief in all quarters. All sectors of Suzhou have scheduled a memorial service to be held at the Humble Administrator's Garden on November 2 and have decided to bury Mr. Yu's remains in the scenic Lingyan Mountain in Tiaocheng, so that tourists can pay their respects.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was born in the 19th year before the Republic of China. He studied in Japan in his early years. In the 8th year of the Republic of China, he was invited by Mr. Zhang Dongsun to join the Shishi Xinbao as the editor-in-chief of the "Xuedeng" supplement. This was the beginning of his participation in journalism, which has lasted for thirty years. He later served as the editor-in-chief of the Jiefang and Gaizao magazines, introducing new Western ideas such as utopia and democracy. During this time, he also traveled extensively to the Soviet Union, Germany, and various Eastern European countries. In Germany, he also studied at the University of Berlin. After returning to China, he served as the Dean of Academic Affairs at China Public School, with Hu Shi as the president. During his spare time, he began to edit the Dongfang Zazhi. After the "January 28th Incident," he joined the Shen Bao, initially editing the Shen Bao Monthly and Weekly, and later becoming the chief editor. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Hu Wenhu invited him to Guangzhou to found the Xingyue Daily, but it did not materialize due to the turbulent situation. In the 29th year, he went to Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily to serve as the chief editor, and later was invited to Singapore to serve as the editor-in-chief of the Sin Chew Daily. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he disguised himself and escaped, successively serving as the editor-in-chief of the Guangxi Daily and the Hengyang Dagang Daily. Throughout his life, except for part-time teaching positions, he never left the journalism field. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he went to Suzhou to head the Journalism Department of the National Social Education College, still diligently cultivating talents for the journalism field. Who knew that his plans would not be completed, and he would pass away first? This is not only a regret for Mr. Yu but also a great loss for our journalism community.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with Mr. Yu began this summer. Four years ago, while in Chongqing, I felt that social mores were deteriorating and people were listless, so I continuously wrote articles in the Xuedeng introducing the ideals of utopia and elaborating on the philosophies of Eugen and Bergson, which unknowingly coincided with Mr. Yu's style twenty years ago. Therefore, I developed admiration for Mr. Yu. This summer, I heard that Mr. Yu was recuperating in Shanghai, so I made a special trip to visit him. He had just recovered from his illness. We started by discussing the soaring domestic prices at the time and talked all the way to world issues. Although it was my first time meeting him, I felt no sense of unfamiliarity. Mr. Yu was talkative, and his topics were endless. We talked for more than four hours. Mr. Yu was very sensitive and also very emotional. When talking about the domestic situation, he repeatedly said sadly: Most of the Chinese people are suffering too much. All conscientious intellectuals should sacrifice a little themselves and do more for the people. When talking about journalism practitioners, Mr. Yu said very objectively: A true journalism practitioner should have no party affiliation. Only with no party affiliation can they be impartial. A true journalism practitioner is faithful in analysis and criticism. The key to analysis and criticism lies in having no biased views. Therefore, Mr. Yu himself, until his death, remained a non-partisan, pure national citizen.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Yu's body was originally very weak, and after escaping from Hong Kong, he experienced hardship and traveled on the Xiang-Gui Road and Qian-Gui Road. Mr. Yu's frail body had already planted the cause of his death through this ordeal. After the victory, due to high prices, Mr. Yu's entire family worked, but Mr. Yu was unable to receive better care. Mr. Yu's monthly teaching income in Suzhou was less than one million yuan. His daily medicines were supplied by Mr. Yu's wife (Mrs. Yu worked at the Central Bank) through her savings. Mr. Yu's illness was caused by overwork, but if he could have received a little more care, he would not have passed away so suddenly. I mourn Mr. Yu's death, I regret Mr. Yu's early death, the journalism community has suffered an immeasurable loss, society has suffered an endless loss, and today's society has a responsibility—October 30th in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Yu Songhua</h3>
<p>— Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was an old colleague of this newspaper. He joined the Shen Bao in the 21st year of the Republic of China, specializing in editing the monthly magazine. According to Mr. Pan Shenchang, an old colleague: "I was in charge of the magazine's distribution at that time, and the threshold was always crowded. In less than five days, we had already subscribed to 100,000 copies." Because the Shen Bao Monthly edited by Mr. Yu at that time vigorously exposed Japan's aggression. To have a periodical with a circulation of over 100,000 copies is probably only the Shen Bao Monthly edited by Mr. Yu!</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's body was very frail, and he was also very short in stature. When we were in Nanwenquan, Chongqing, we often went to see him. He was teaching at the Journalism Department of the Central Political School and was always kind in explaining everything to us. He lived in a small thatched cottage, truly a so-called "small room." We knew he was very poor, but when we went to his place, we always had fragrant tea and peanuts to eat.</p>
<p>Later, I often went to Chongqing, and he lived in Zhangjia Garden, which required climbing many slopes. I often went to see him, and he often came to see me. I asked him what mode of transportation he used, and he patted his own two legs. When I thought about him having to climb such high slopes and walk such a long distance, I almost shed tears.</p>
<p>In June of the 36th year, I saw him in Suzhou. His body was even worse. His voice was no longer as bright as before, and his back was even more hunched, but he still had unparalleled ambition and vigor.</p>
<p>I heard that he unfortunately died on October 11. My meeting with him in Suzhou was our last encounter. How can society not take good care of such a knowledgeable and upright person, allowing him to suffer the insults of frost and snow? Whose responsibility is this?</p>
<h3>On Deaf-Muteness</h3>
<p>— Ya Qiang</p>
<p>Previously, I saw a newspaper report stating that the Legislative Yuan claimed that deaf-mute people have the right to be elected as National Assembly representatives. This regulation not only conforms to the meaning of "democracy" but can also eliminate the usual general public's contempt and indifference towards deaf-mute people.</p>
<p>The general public despises deaf-mute people because they cannot "hear" or "speak," which is truly ignorant. This defect can be compensated for among deaf-mute people. As soon as deaf-mute children enter school, they learn to "read," and each word and phrase is represented by a hand gesture. The more they read, the more gestures they learn, and they can communicate their ideas to each other as they wish, just like ordinary people talking. As for those who have not received education, there are also some common gestures to replace language. Although deaf-mute people are "disabled," they have places where they are "superior" to ordinary people. The author has seen third-grade students at deaf-mute schools copy portraits of people, vividly and realistically, and the artwork of fifth and sixth-grade students is much more outstanding than that of ordinary middle school students. Many graduates of deaf-mute schools are excellent advertising painters, set designers, sculptors, and other art workers. Because they do not have the annoyance of "sound," they have unique ingenuity, and their artistic achievements are indeed one notch above ordinary people.</p>
<p>According to researchers of deaf-mute education, deaf-mute people can be said to have no other desires besides "warm clothes and full stomachs." Unlike ordinary people who, in addition to "sufficient food and clothing," indulge in "sensual pleasures" and compete for "fame and wealth," only to earn endless worries and pains. Deaf-mute people do not have these desires, which reduces a lot of suffering. Their mood is much calmer than that of ordinary people.</p>
<p>The world is muddy, and people's hearts are unpredictable. Those with pure will cannot help but sigh and be depressed. If they were deaf-mute, they would hear and ask less, which could reduce a lot of mental "punishment." Using their precious energy on lofty art, beautifying "life," and contributing to humanity, in this way, deaf-mute people should not only not be despised, but should also be admired.</p>
<h3>Feng Dao's Humor</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>During the Five Dynasties period, Feng Xiang (Dao) and Xiang (Ning) were both in the Chancellery. One day, Xiang asked Feng, "How much did you pay for your new boots?" Feng raised his left foot and showed Xiang and said, "Nine hundred." Xiang was impatient and quickly looked back at the clerk and said, "How did my boots cost eighteen hundred?" He scolded him. After a while, Feng slowly raised his right foot and said, "This one is also nine hundred." Then everyone laughed. (Gui Tian Lu)</p>
<h3>The Life of a Official in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>"Don't say you're not saddened; the wind from the west rolls up the curtains, and you are thinner than the yellow flowers."</p>
<p>Quoting these three lines from Li Qingzhao to describe the demeanor of the average civil servant in the capital today is truly the most appropriate. Especially after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the "October wind," like a surging tide of "prices" rising upwards, has made these officials, struggling in poverty, jump through a volcano once more. Although they have been somewhat settled, "Nanjing" has become "Nan"jing, how can they not become even thinner!</p>
<p>Originally, I would not mention it, but the life of the average official in the capital, apart from those few who are more capable and can still live in Western-style buildings and travel by car, most of them are afraid of living in poverty. Autumn is deep, and those who "the whole family is in the west wind, and the winter clothes have not yet been cut" are a large number.</p>
<p>The life of the officials in the capital is also very dry and monotonous. Seven or eight hours a day on a cold bench, doesn't that make people feel tired and bored? When the sky is still in the hazy scenery, those who live far away from the office have to get up and catch the transportation bus. If the wife is not greedy for sleep, she may not have to go into the kitchen to cook breakfast herself, otherwise, she has to do it herself. After getting off work and going home, if you are a father, then you also have to take on the responsibility of a nanny, fulfilling your obligations to your wife. If the seven things run out, you have to solve the nineteen yourself. As the saying goes, "Poor couples are sad in everything." The more difficult the situation, the worse the mood, and the family's quarrels become commonplace.</p>
<p>If we say that the difficulty of making a living is the first threat to the minds of officials in the capital, then the "housing shortage" is undoubtedly the second obstacle. The so-called "housing shortage" here is not really that there are no houses, but that they cannot afford to live in them. There are so many large and small institutions in the capital, but the organs that provide dormitories are rare. Single men may have organ dormitories to live in, but those with dependents are almost non-existent. A few public education new villages can only accommodate 10% of the people, and they have already been taken by those who got there first. It seems that there are many empty high-rise buildings, and the Western-style houses built in the past year are also erected everywhere, but the deposit of more than 10 million yuan is not something that small officials in the capital, who have difficulty making a living, can afford. Even the worst bungalow will require a rent deposit of 1 or 2 million yuan at a time, which is already a considerable amount. In this way, having no place to live makes the average person who has left their families in their hometowns dare not think of "reunion."</p>
<h3>On Gambling on Mahjong</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>Among the forms of gambling popular among Chinese people, besides old-fashioned playing cards, mahjong has the longest history. In terms of popularity, mahjong is also the number one. Not only has it traveled to Europe and America, but it was also once one of the national forms of gambling in Japan. Mahjong is also known as mahjong sparrow. Although there are various accounts of its origin, there is no doubt that the inventor must have been from Zhejiang. Some researchers say that the inventor's surname was Zhong and his given name was Fa Bai, but I think this is just speculation. Just like the playing cards in Europe and America, it is impossible to point out who invented them, but what is certain is that they must have started as playing cards and were continuously improved.</p>
<p>Among gambling, new gadgets such as roulette, poker, Shahar, horse racing, and old gambling such as Pai Gow, dice, and paper mahjong, none of them have the appeal of mahjong. Today, let's calculate how much time the Chinese people sacrifice in mahjong. It is truly shocking.</p>
<p>Now, let's take Shanghai as an example. Assuming that Shanghai has a population of 4 million, with 4 people per household, there are 1 million households. Among the 1 million households, 200,000 households have mahjong tiles, and 100,000 households play mahjong every day. Each household playing mahjong has 4 people, so 100,000 households have 400,000 people. Each time, the minimum limit is 8 rounds, and each 4 rounds is calculated as 1.5 hours, then the time spent by 4 people in each household in one day is 12 hours. 100,000 households have 1.2 million hours, and each day has 8 working hours, which is 150,000 working days. In other words, the time wasted by 4 million households in Shanghai playing mahjong every day is a total of 150,000 working days. The average month is calculated as 30 days, so one month wastes 4.5 million days. One year has 54 million days. One year is calculated as 365 days, which is 148,000 years. Each person lives for an average of 60 years (this refers to urban people), then there are 2,466 people who live their entire lives in vain. Other cities can be inferred in the same way. What do we want to do that is not successful? The question is what to do? This depends on the self-reflection of the parties involved and the leadership of the government. I think that suppression and prohibition are not useful.</p>
<h3>Couplet Snippets</h3>
<p>— Wang Bairi</p>
<p>When the martyr Song Jiaoren died, a certain celebrity wrote a mourning couplet for Yuan Shikai, saying: "Since Zhou Yu was born, why was Zhuge Liang born? If the hometown does not die, the solitary one is uneasy." The twelve characters are purely idioms from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which is extremely appropriate. The so-called article is inherently natural, and the wonderful hand gets it occasionally. It is true! But it is also cruel.</p>
<p>The author of the Pipa Ji, Gao Ming, courtesy name Ze Cheng, was from Yongjia, Zhejiang. He was extraordinary at the age of six or seven. A neighboring minister, dressed in scarlet robes, came out to see off a guest. Ze Cheng happened to be returning from a teacher, dressed in green clothes. The minister joked, "A frog out of the water wears a green jacket, with beautiful eyes and anticipation." Ze Cheng responded, "A shrimp out of the soup wears a red robe, bowing in reverence." The minister was greatly surprised and called him a child prodigy.</p>
<p>In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I passed through the Chongren Guan in the western countryside of Cixi and saw a couplet in front of the paper furnace: "Today ascending to heaven relies on cremation, in those years falling to the ground made a golden sound." With the current situation in front of me, I realized the reality of the whole year, using the word "fire" to lead to the following word "gold." It can be said to be extremely stable. It is not possible without a skillful hand.</p>
<p>Miss America</p>
<h3>Miss America's Summer Life</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Summer is the most active season for American women. Women known for their healthy beauty can only fully flaunt their curves during summer. Therefore, summer becomes the world of American women. Other women, French, British, and Chinese, can only hide their flaws in summer, unwilling to expose their slight waists and entire rib cages for others to admire. There are many ways for Miss America to flaunt her curves, with clothing being the most important. First, let's talk about pants. One type is Slack pants, which are loose-fitting thigh pants with loose waistbands, completely different from Western-style pants and similar to the long pants worn by Chinese women. These pants are the easiest to accentuate the beauty of the hips because they are tightly fitted above the crotch, thanks to the thoughtful design of the designers. As for tops, there are Spanish-style short-sleeved, open-chested chiffon shirts, tight-fitting sweat shirts that make the two peaks of the chest appear particularly high, backless half-dress outfits that resemble the upper part of women's formal dresses, and summer casual wear similar to swimsuits. In short, they try to accentuate the curves of the chest, hips, and legs as much as possible. They have many kinds of activities in summer. Swimming pools are their daily must-go place. Even those who cannot swim wear swimsuits and drink Coca-Cola in the pool-side tea room, flirting and having fun with male guests.</p>
<p>In coastal cities, pairs of young men and women sleeping under sun umbrellas on the beach are common. They bring travel chairs, beer, sandwiches, and soda, spending the entire afternoon on the scorching beach. They certainly can't cool off on the scorching beach, obviously to flaunt their healthy beauty, tanning their skin to a chestnut color, Sun-tanred. If the skin is too pale and not healthy enough, they have to buy a bottle of chestnut-colored paint and apply it all over the body, pretending to be healthy. If you have a close girlfriend, you may notice that she is always worried that her skin is not tanned enough and will go to the beach and park to take off her outerwear completely, wearing only a pair of swimming socks, covering her face with a handkerchief, lying flat on the beach or grass to sunbathe. They don't cry even if they get sunburned, because they have to put in such hard work for beauty and health, even if their skin peels off.</p>
<p>Skating rinks are also places where Miss America flaunts her health and beauty. Skating is a good opportunity to show off the beauty of the thighs, and skating skills depend entirely on the legs. Once skating skills are mastered, the thighs will naturally become healthy and beautiful. We can hardly find a skater whose thighs are not well-developed. The skating posture also helps to correct the beauty of the chest and waist. People who can skate must have a particularly high chest and a particularly straight waist. Skating is most helpful for the development of muscles below the waist, so women who can skate are often the most ideal lovers. American women list skating, swimming, and dancing as compulsory subjects for developing health and beauty.</p>
<h3>Airplanes Should Be Called "厶"</h3>
<p>— Zheng Dakang</p>
<p>Currently, the library already has "　" as a single-character name, and today's airplanes in the sky, like boats and vehicles on land and water, are both important for transportation, but there is no single-character proper name. Only the character "機" (ji, machine) is used to represent them, but the character "機" has many uses, such as the "機" (ji) in "機器" (jiqi, machine) and the "機" (ji) in "機會" (jihui, opportunity). Examining idioms, there are originally phrases like "乘機下野" (chenji xiaye, take the opportunity to retire) and "乘機出走" (chenji chuzou, take the opportunity to flee), "乘機××" (chenji ××, take the opportunity to ××), etc. Under today's prevalence of airplanes, misunderstandings are inevitable. Therefore, the creation of a single character for "airplane" is necessary. Checking the Kangxi Dictionary's "Bei Kao" (備考), "Chou Ji" (丑集), "Si Bu" (厶部), there is the character "　" (si), which sounds "jian" but has no meaning. Using it as the single-character proper name for "airplane" is very appropriate. Not only is the sound the same, but the upper part of the character, "厶" (si), resembles the propeller of an airplane, and the middle "一" (yi) resembles the wings, and "—" resembles the fuselage, making it a coincidental pictographic character. From this, we can infer that the "航" (hang) in "航空" (hangkong, aviation) can also be created as a "航" (hang) character to distinguish it from the "航" (hang) in "航船" (hangchuan, ship). In the future, if we use "　" (si) to represent "機" (ji, machine) and "航" (hang), not only will the meaning of the characters be clear, but the strokes will be simple, and writing will be more convenient.</p>
