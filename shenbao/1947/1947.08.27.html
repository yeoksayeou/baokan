<h3>政院會議討論節約　實施辦法交付審查　張院長提議組督導委會</h3>
<p>行政院廿六日上午舉行第十八次例會，張院長主席，通過重要議案如次：（一）行政法規整理委員會組織規程，（二）各級政府機關學校舉行週會或月會辦法，（三）蒙藏同胞與僑民選舉監察委員時之中央主辦機關，分別指定蒙藏與僑務兩委員會，（四）附收行駛南北洋及長江幹綫之輪船貨運運費百分之二，撥充兩廣水災振款案，決議不得就運費附加，致增人民負担，（五）歸綏設市，但不另增國大代表名額，（六）中紡公司供應三十六年度軍用紗布價款，（七）山東·山西·甘肅三省緊急措施費，（八）平津二市警察食糧，（九）南北防疫專款，（十）追加資源委員會易貨償債購運礦產費，（十一）修理粤省黃花崗等各項革命紀念建築物經費，（十二）追加蘭州中央醫院三十六年度六至十二月份經常費，（十三）追加善後救濟基金待分配數，（十四）糧食部政務次長龐松舟，另有任用，免職，任命端木愷繼任，（十五）兼國立政治大學長蔣中正請辭兼職，慮免兼職，任命顧毓琇繼任。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕政院廿六日晨例會，曾討論有關節約兩大要案，一為組織節約督導委會，一為根據各機關業務實際需要，限制員額，惟因尙待詳加研討，決議再付審查。關於有關節約消費各項實施辦法，將由政院特組審查會負責審查，上兩案亦當一併辦理。</p>
<p>節約督導委會，係遵奉蔣主席手令所擬定，蔣主席於十九日曾令行政院長張羣「關於政府節約事項之考核與督導，行政院內應指定重要人員專心主持其事，最好有一簡單組織，俾得負責實施」。張院長因決組節約督導委會，並擬定組織規程草案，提會討論。</p>
<p>該草案內容為：（一）政院為督導節約消費綱要與其有關各種辦法之實施，設節約督導委會（二）本委會設主委一人，由行政院長就政委中指定一人兼任，委員十二人除以政院副秘長及內政·國防·經濟·交通·社會五部次長各一為常然委員外，由行政院長就監院監委及全經會委員中各聘三人充任。（三）本委會設主任秘書一人，以政院秘書處第六組主任兼任，秘書及職員若干人，由主任秘書就第六組人員中指定兼任，於必要時，並得呈請行政院長就政院秘書處·全經會秘書處或有關各部加調人員協助。（四）本委會每兩星期開會一次，於必要時由主委召集臨時會。（五）本委會得函請中央各官署及各省市府提出關於推行節約綱要與辦法之報告，加以檢討。（六）本委會各委員應以兩人為一組，隨時分赴中央各官署及各大都市檢察推行節約綱要與辦法之實情，但委員執行檢查任務時，應對本人與有關係之機關迴避。（七）本委會發現中央各官署及各省市府對於節約綱要與辦法推行不力時，得經過半數之決議，報請行政院長核辦。</p>
<h3>限制各機關員額　擬具實施暨檢察兩方案</h3>
<p>限制各機關員額，係根據國務會議通過之「厲行節約消費辦法綱要」，由政院訂定實施辦法暨檢察辦法，經擬具甲·乙兩方案，並邀主計處審計部會同審查修正。</p>
<p>甲案為「各機關根據業務實際需要，實施限制員額及檢審辦法」，（一）公務機關及公營事業機關員額，以卅六年度核定預算名額為標準，嗣後不得再追加。（二）限制員額之檢察，依照預決算之程序，嚴格控制之。</p>
<p>乙案為「各機關根據業務實際需要，實施裁减機構，限制員額及檢察辦法」，（一）各部會·各省市縣府及所屬機關，就現在實際需要，保留其必不可少之機構，其非目前切要或非當前所能舉辦之事業，應予裁撤或歸併（關於省縣政府機構裁减，內部已擬有方案，可以採用），各機關經辦某種臨時事務，不必另設機關，其所需人員，應以調用為原則。（二）國營事業機關之無事業費暨無經常業務者，應即裁撤。（三）各部會各省市縣政府及所屬機關設置人員，應以處理事務繁簡為標準，以定其應設之員額，原有組織龐大或員額超過，應設法縮减或分別裁併。（四）應設員額標準如左：甲·一般行政機關以收發文件為準，統一規定每人每月應辦之文件數量（收發文合計），就該機關本年度一至六月底止收發文總數清算後，確定其員額。乙·執行機關以處理事務為標準，確定其員額。丙·研究機關以研究事項為標準，確定其員額。丁·生產機關以比照各該地民營事業所需人員為標準，確定其員額，前項各款詳細標準，由政院所屬各部會暨省市縣政府就所轄機關性質分別擬具，由政院核定後，統一規定之（各機關內部單位，亦應依此標準自動調整，以免輕重偏枯，勞逸不均之弊）。國營事業機關應擬具較富彈性之組織法規，完成立法程序，其人員應依人事法規之規定，送請銓叙。（五）各機關辦理事務人員（文書，出納，庶務本機關之會計人事）之總額，不得超過辦理業務人員百分之卅。（六）各機關確定應列員額後，其舊有人員保留之程序如左，甲·依法考試及格人員，乙·銓叙合格人員，丙·有特殊技能之專門人員，依前三項名額分配後，尙有餘額，應在剩餘額內舉行考試，以成績次序先後暨參考服務年資保留之。（七）確定裁减人員之處理，依左列程序，甲·協助轉業，乙·給資遣散，丙·政府如因事實上之需要增設新機構時，其人員應儘先以前項被裁人員任用之，前項協助轉業如由政務機關介紹職業者，不給遺散費，如自行謀生或經營事業，原服務機關半予協助者，仍得發給遣散費。（八）各機關根據本辦法裁减人員，如有特殊困難，得呈請政院擬定，對於標準應設人員外之足額人員，暫不裁减，惟原有人員去職者（包括自動離職及因故撤職等）不得再補，以期逐漸達到標準人數，前項超額去職人員之數額，應按月呈報上級機關，　報政院查核，追减預算。（九）裁員經費，准就各該機關已列入年度預算之經費內開支，不得另行追加。（十）各機關就前列各條確定員額後，經費開支均以該項員額為準，以預決算之程序嚴格控制之，此後如有變動應於每年編列年度預算時，再就上述標準調整之，平時一律不准追加。（十一）檢察事宜，由主計機關，審計機關依法辦理。</p>

<h3>分配職團名額辦法　谷正綱說明三點　總額有限者劃區分配或全國合選</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕谷部長正綱為職業團體選舉名額分配辦法，頃發表談話如下：關於國代立委之職業團體選舉名額詳細分配辦法，本部原應早日訂頒，祗以工商業團體原表分配名額過少，先後據各該團體文電呼籲，復奉國府令交立院核議，本部亦准國府文官處函，轉奉主席諭逕與立院洽商，現尙未獲解決，惟國大選舉程序開始已久，此項詳細分配辦法，不容再事擱候，祗得將工商業團體部份暫不分配，候各該項名額改定另案訂頒。茲先將其他詳細分配辦法制頒公布，其中最重要須加說明者，有下列三點：（一）兩種選舉各種職業團體應選出之名額及其中婦女名額之分配，係由立院於原表內訂定，本部祗能就既定配額內斟酌絀分。（二）各種職業團體配額總數有限，除國大農人工人兩團體代表勉可依省市細分外，其他一部份尙可劃全國為若干區者，則劃七區分配另一部份特殊性事業亦儘可能按業分配，數額最少者方定為全國合選，以免偏枯。（三）婦女配額除敎育會從業人中婦女較多，其國大代表名額可分區配定外，其他概以全國綜合計票，以免　縣缺額。</p>

<p>〔本報廣州廿六日電〕孫副主席廿六日上午九時半於行轅官舍接見記者時，對各項詢問答稱：（一）魏使來華係視察如何帮助中國，其他推測實屬過慮，目前威脅中國者為蘇聯而非美國，由旅大問題可證明，副主席繼以慷慨語調指謫為新帝國主義者，此次國難實較「九一八」為嚴重，吾人應特別警覺。（二）中央破壞和平，摧殘交通及工業，使人民不能過活，實為國人所共棄，要內亂停止，除非中共能回心轉意，放棄戰爭，但渠相信共亂必可平，除非吾人不努力。（三）收回香港問題，目前尙談不到。（四）大選決如期舉行，謂延期並無法律根據。（五）渠本人競選立委尙未予考慮。又悉：孫副主席定卅日返京。</p>

<h3>華府權威方面　分析魏使文告　盼我立即革新俾予援助</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕消息靈通某方面（此方面素與特使國有密切聯繫）廿五日稱：「魏德邁將軍臨別文告之發表，無疑地希望能逼使中國政府實施若干改革，使美國增加對中央政府之援助有提依據。至於文告嚴峻之口氣，絕非顯示魏氏在九月中旬返華府後，將建議停止援助中央政府」。該方面稱：魏氏文告發表之時間，表示由於中國有官方意見及輿論之效力，逼令中國政府在杜魯門總統及馬歇爾將軍建議根據魏氏之發現援助中國時，能有若干革新。否則此文告將於魏使返國後再行發表。魏氏稱：如中共「確係愛國」，則宜停止戰爭，以「和平方式」協助國家。此間一般意見以為中共絕不會如此做，則彼等不能逃避魏氏之譴責。</p>
<p>另一方面，魏氏指斥國民政府官員之無能與貪汚，可能因改革之證據而告冲淡。</p>
<p>一般觀察家以為，魏氏已為中國政府留一後步，使能自振以符合美援助之資格，但魏使對中共之建議，中共顯然不能接受。</p>
<p>魏氏雖對中國政府各部門大肆捷伐，惟與馬歇爾去春聲明相同，對蔣主席列為例外。</p>
<p>此項事實，佐以魏氏所稱政府改革應立即實施，使此間外交觀察家期待最近期內中國政府將宣布「改組」。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕紐約時報今日評魏德邁將軍聲明稱：「魏將軍之言，極為明白，即中國最遠之省份，亦可聽到。此項聲明事實上乃對國民政府的溫和「哀的美敦」畫，言明國民政府在未完成本身嚴厲及誠實之整肅工作前，決不能獲得美方之援助。</p>
<h3>民社黨馮今白　將赴歐美考察</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕民社黨要員馮今白，短期內出國赴歐美，考察各國政治現况，並研究其政治修明，社會秩序安定之因素。據馮氏語記者，渠考察之動機，乃因我國當前政治局勢之混亂，欲以研究所得有所借鏡。其考察之目標，擬特別着重歐西各小國如瑞士等國之發展情形，因美國處於高度電氣化足夠條件下，一切發展自不足與比。馮氏考察時間約為年餘，以個人名義前往，渠於廿六日自牯嶺抵京，辦理出國手續後，即赴滬。</p>
<h3>魏使由日抵漢城　發表聲明闡示此行目的　報告書决在夏威夷草擬</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿六日電〕魏德邁中將廿六日晨九時卅分離此間羽田機塲飛赴朝鮮。魏德邁將之發言人答覆問題時稱，渠對魏德邁使團將訪問韓北蘇軍區，表示懷疑，但此事並不確定，蓋魏氏尙未獲悉韓境美軍已議定何種計劃。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿六日電〕魏德邁特使一行廿六日下午二時廿五分飛抵此間，當即發表聲明稱，此次實地調查定期一週，不擬舉行記者招待會，使團人員工作完全客觀，毫無成見。所獲報告悉將提交美國政府，傳便決定如何援助朝鮮人民，增進福利並保障其爭取匪易之和平。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京廿六日電〕消息靈通人士稱：魏德邁特使訪問朝鮮後將飛日本轉赴夏威夷，俾在該處「不受外界影響」專心草擬報告，遞呈杜魯門總統。魏氏選擇夏威夷編製報告，其故有二，蓋夏威夷氣候溫和，與南京之濕熱完全不同，且位置適當，實為良好之工作環境。</p>
<p>王外長在政務會中　述評魏使離華聲明</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕廿六日政務會議中，外長王世杰曾就魏德邁將軍來華一事有所報告，略謂：魏特使在華一月，我方曾盡可能予以協助，便利其工作。渠之臨別聲明，確屬十分坦白而直率，其出發點則為眞摯之友誼。渠在華期間，惜乎過短，而我國情况以及遠東局勢，半年來變化殊多，對若干問題，魏氏似仍宜繼續了解。旋各政委紛紛發言，有認魏氏批評政府若干官員貪汚無能一點，過於籠統模糊者。有認為中國之困難已非單純之內政問題。魏氏聲明中謂，一切應由我負責自求解決之結論，似欠公正。有認為就魏氏聲明觀之，若干論斷與以前多次來華美國諸要員所為者並無二致，此或有受觀念影響之嫌。有認為魏氏仍期望共匪放棄武力鬥爭，顧及人民利益一點，係迂闊之論者。唯仍一致承認魏氏為我國諍友，並共期通力。各政委於熱烈之討論後，咸願各自努力，勵精圖治，共渡時艱。</p>

<h3>「鐵簾」幕後第一信　進入紅色的波蘭首都　憑弔華沙廢墟</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　毛樹清</p>
<p>維斯杜拉河蜿蜒向北流，從喀爾巴阡山，一直到波羅的海，靜靜的，黯灰色的河水，創造了波蘭大平原，也創造了美麗的都市華沙。據波蘭人自己說：他們的祖宗，世世代代居留在這裏，這兒是他們原始的「老家」，正規的波蘭的史實，開始在公元一千年左右，九百多年來，一部波蘭的歷史，是血和淚編織成功的，一直到今天，波蘭人講起「天下大勢」，他們會從心底裏隱隱作痛。</p>
<p>我是從柏林搭英國空軍的飛機，進入華沙的。事先，我確乎感到異樣的惶恐。說老實話，我倒並不因爲華沙在　簾簾幕後，才担心有什麼生命危險，而是爲了我了解波蘭的情形太少。在國內時書舖裏很少有專講波蘭的書（彷彿獨立出版社有一本波蘭復國史），評論或介紹近代波蘭情形的更少。一九三九年，希特勒進軍華沙，莫洛托夫和里賓特羅甫的香檳酒杯下，波蘭被瓜分，國內有一張報紙，寫過一篇相當「驚人」的投井下石的評論。這件公案，我預備在下一篇通訊中詳細提到，但無論如何，波蘭的處境是悲慘的，在中國人的眼睛當中，波蘭也並不像那位評論作者所看的那樣「討厭」。</p>
<p>波蘭朝鮮差可比擬</p>
<p>在華沙逗留的幾天印象，對於波蘭人，使我想起國內一位年靑作家的小說「北極風情畫」，那裏面講一位朝鮮靑年和波蘭姑娘的「羅受史」，拿西方的波蘭，比擬遠東的朝鮮，我認爲這位作者，有一種獨到的靈感。離開柏林前三天，在記者俱樂部遇見基督科學箴言報的女記者考恩老小姐，她那時也正預備飛華沙，我們談些拉扯的閒話，最後她很正經地說了一句：「去看看也好，看看一個永遠被旁人征服的民族，他們潛伏在內心的悲哀！」</p>
<p>她坐美國飛機比我前一天進入華沙，我因爲匆促中，柏林的雜務沒了結，臨時才請皇家空軍替我帮忙的，皇家空軍每星期有兩班專機，從倫敦到波蘭，經過柏林（美國飛機每星期有一班客機），靠一位瓊斯少校的特別奔走，臨時把我的名字安插進去。大淸早，天剛黎明，柏林僑胞徐錫崇君，和維也納來的僑領留京位先生，駕自備汽車送我到「蓋託」飛機塲。兩小時零五分的短短的旅程，我飛越了森嚴的「鐵簾」，進了紅色的波蘭首都華沙。</p>
<p>言語不通　英語威力「　終」</p>
<p>到華沙遭逢的第一個難題是「語言不通」，一位同路的波蘭外交部職員，新從倫敦歸來，機塲上很多歡迎他的人，彼此滿口都是「琴達別來」，對付許多替他搬行李的人，盡是「見鬼」。皇家空軍把我裝到了華沙飛機塲，他們的責任算是完畢，爲了找進城的「街車」，言語不通，急得滿頭大汗，最後，還是外交部職員帮忙，「揩油」坐上了他的行李車。</p>
<p>行李車中並肩坐著一位外交部的勤務兵，他敬了我一枝波蘭紙烟，任憑用怎樣比擬，他都不能了解我一句英國話。歐洲的「鐵簾」，不僅是政治外交的分野，也是「言語」的分野，踏進了鐵簾背後，英語的威力，算是壽終正寢。有李車中我抬頭看天，我心中有一種難以形容的恐懼，恐懼我波蘭之行的使命會全部失敗。</p>
<p>飛機塲在華沙城的西南角，塲上停滿有二十餘架「國營波蘭航空公司」的客機和運輸機，一律是嶄新的銀底黑字的標記。站上有許多的美英旅客，有許多瑞典航空公司，捷克航空公司的廣吿，招徠遊客觀光斯德哥爾摩和布拉格，我注意牆上沒有招徠遊歷莫斯科的廣吿，大槪，俄國人是不頂歡喜那一套的！</p>
<p>驚心怵目完整房屋一幢無</p>
<p>華沙給我的觸目驚心的印象是：瓦礫遍地，戰爭的痕跡，完全存在。一九四五年我旅行在刧後歐洲，我看見柏林的廢墟，和漢堡的殘破，曾經留給我一個不能磨滅的印象。這回到漢蘭，事隔兩年，我仍然覺得華沙的慘况，驚心怵目。波蘭人自己說：華沙城內沒有一幢百分之百的完整的房屋，像麻臉一樣的槍彈窟窿，炸塌了的一半房屋十鋼骨水泥的「危牆」，乃至於砲彈最厲害的所謂「猶太區」，一片廢墟，連危牆的空廓子也找不到。我常常歡喜問能說英文的華沙人：「依你的觀察，需要多少年，華沙才能恢復到戰前的光景？」他們總是把報子一縮，兩手一伸：『十年，二十年，也許三十年』！</p>
<p>沒有一個波蘭人不津津樂道他們戰前的華沙：綠蔭陰夾道的柏油馬路，星羅櫛比的方正的建築，紅色的屋頂，從屋頂的小窗戶中，可以望見敎堂的鐘樓，望見維斯杜拉河黯藍的河水，（註：波蘭人自己呌維斯瓦河）。夏天水淺，維斯杜拉河上，漲起了沙灘，多少紅男綠女，在維斯杜拉河的淺水中游泳，他們唱歌，運動，乃至於沉醉。</p>
<p>納粹破壞不擇手段　把小巴黎毀滅了</p>
<p>一九三九年，他們永遠不會忘記那悲慘的年頭，砲火衝散了他們的安定的生活，年靑人流浪到遠方，年老的呻吟在鐵蹄下茍安了五年。但是，那時候，華沙依然是完整的，毁壞的不及百分之二十。</p>
<p>華沙的災難，發生在一九四四年，俄羅斯的軍隊，夏初光復了盧布林，勢如破竹地衝到了華沙城郊。那時候，在莫斯科的波蘭民族委員會，改組成盧布林的波蘭政府，原先流亡在倫敦的正統的波蘭政府，爲了要配合戰鬥力量，發動了所有的華沙地下工作者，爆發了一次反納粹的『革命運動』，城裏的革命，原是期待配合俄國軍隊的攻勢的。殊不知倫敦和莫斯科之間，事先並沒有諒解，倫敦流亡政府領導的『首都革命』爆發了，俄羅斯軍隊，以及在俄國領導下的波蘭軍隊，按兵不動，而且還後退了好幾百米突。這樣，惹動了德國軍隊的深切響恨，那些納粹小伙子們，放火的放火。倒油的倒油埋地雷的埋地雷，對華沙城不擇手段的破壞。一九四四年八月和九月，是華沙永遠不能磨減的黑暗的日子，俄國兵的遠遠的砲火，地下武力和納粹軍隊的巷戰，毁滅了華沙，毁減了這座一度被稱爲「小巴黎」的美麗的城市。</p>
<p>市容三分像重慶</p>
<p>俄羅斯軍隊正式攻入華沙城，是一九四五年二月間的事。許多華僑們還看見：在地下武力孤軍苦戰的時期，英國飛機在華沙上空投擲給養。時斷時續的巷戰，進行了一個多月，莊麗的建築，貫穿了砲彈，維斯瓦河上雄偉的大橋，全都炸斷。</p>
<p>如今，四座大橋修復了一座，徘徊在橋上，使我想起捷克布拉格的大橋，東歐的都市，彼此都有相同之點，都有一種發人深思的獨到之處。如今，時移勢變，東歐都遮蓋上了「辦簾」，春閨深鎖，當然又有了許多不同的感想！</p>
<p>華沙給予我的另一個影象，是三分像重慶，斷垣殘壁，危牆處處，馬路兩旁，却悠然蓋起了許多沒有棋的平房，使我回想起重慶商塲和上淸寺。街顯巷尾的小小四方木屋，在華沙遍地都是它們是香烟攤和報攤。横穿馬路的高空標語，馬路上三三五五的草綠而骯髒制服的士兵，無一不像戰爭最艱苦時期的重慶。特別是華沙近郊的長途公共汽車，沒有頂，沒有蓬，四圍加釘着木欄杆的卡車，旅客還得先領號碼，領了號碼等候唱名按「一條龍」上車，正和重慶七星崗的景緻，完全一樣。</p>
<p>房荒程度冠世界規定兩人住一室</p>
<p>交通的困難還不算，華沙最成問題的是住宅，全世界處處閙一房荒」，但恐怕都沒有華沙厲書，戰火破壞了華沙一半以上的住屋，都市的人口，並不見减少。波蘭首都警察廳，規定兩人合住一室，「十室九空」的大戶人家，警察廳强迫將餘屋出租。在華沙臨時找旅館，尤其是困難萬分。</p>
<p>華沙有三家「通洋務」的旅館，博羅尼，布列斯特，和中央。打仗以前，布列斯特規模最大，但不幸毁於砲火，現在正在「大興土木」在修理。博羅尼最完整，美國大使，許多外交使領人員，乃至於外籍記者，一概住在博羅尼。我因爲皇家空軍算不定日子，事先沒有打電報臨時到博羅尼要房子，「掌櫃的」看着我很尶尬，事後才知道：住博羅尼旅館，必須有波蘭外交部的通知書，纔准搬入。使館替我打電話問外交部，波蘭外交部回答的很妙：「這位記者是彼蘭政府邀請來的，還是請求來的？如果是邀請來的，可以住博羅尼！」我當然自己識相，另覓它法，最後總算彙使館葆近甫代辦和李肇瑞秘書的帮忙，搬進了「大興土木」一半完工的布列斯特大飯店。</p>
<p>這樣，我總算來到了華沙，第一脚，我踏進了「鐵簾」的裏層！（七月十九日於華沙）</p>
<p>（註：「琴達別來」，波蘭語即爲「早安」之意；「見鬼」或讀作「琴貴」波蘭語即為「謝謝一之意。）</p>

<p>我國傳統一向尊師，即在今日的鄉村裏，我們還可以看見家家戶戶，貼着「天地國親師」紅紙黑字的中堂，天天在那裏焚香跪拜。我們在各種職業中，爲什麼要特別尊師？這是値得我們加以考慮的。要知道敎師職業的特性，是「捨己爲人」，要「學不厭，誨不倦」，他是國民的保姆，是社會的導師，是學術思想的領導者，是人羣的模範。他担任了建國最基層的工作。</p>
<p>社會像一座金字塔，列在塔頂的是大政治家，大軍事家，大科學家，大藝術家……受着社會人士的敬仰，贊美，和崇拜；但在敎師，尤其是中小學的敎師，却像放在這座大塔的最低層的基石，承受着最大的壓力；他們沒有名，沒有利，沒有權勢；有的祇是一股熱情，天天辛勤啓發着學生天賦的智慧和良善的品性，而與兒童靑年的墮性，愚笨，惡習慣……相奮鬥。中學數學敎師今年講解「一次方程式」，明年依然是「一次方程式」，儘管敎學方法變換，其內容還是大體相同，年復一年，學生是成名了，他還依然在講解「一次方程式」，他站在崗位上，終年努力，要以學生的成就爲成就，學生的快樂爲快樂，他本身有「光」，有「熱」，但這「光」與「熱」，却往往不爲社會一般人所了解。結果，他好像燃點起了許多的燭光，而他的本人却承受着這燭光的反映而得到光輝與快樂。敎師把希望與快樂，建築在學生的身上，自己祇是埋頭苦幹，不計名利，不謀權勢，尤其是在今日中國的社會裏，特別是在鄕村中，暍着薄粥過日子。所以理想的敎師是「聖賢」，是「完人」，是「無名英雄」，這樣的敎師還不値得我們崇拜，我們尊敬嗎？</p>
<p>敎師値得我們尊敬的理由，旣如上述。但不幸得很，今日中國傳統尊師的精神，早已喪失殆盡了。敎師的本身有一部分也似乎變了質，我們想到「尊師重道」或「師嚴道尊」一類的字眼，看看目前實際的狀况，便未免憂從中來，不可終日。</p>
<p>在今日的社會上，往往以金錢來代表一個人的地位和成功，物質生活的條件，當然更跟着財富走，敎師生活艱苦，未免被一部份人看爲「窮酸」，社會一般道德墮落，窮，便被人看不起了，那裏還會「尊」呢？即使有人講「尊師」，大部份也是表面的，口頭的，一般社會所崇拜的是有錢有勢，敎師有什麽値得一般世俗的人看得起呢？無怪初中畢業生都進高中，而不願進師範，高中畢業生志願進師範學院的總比大學來得少，除非他想得「公費」才進師範，這是敎育界有目共睹的事實。我們在不少的集會裏，聽見別的朋友勸敎師改行，說敎師當下去是一輩子沒有出息的。這些談話往往會在很知己的朋友當中發現，究其本意，並非出於惡意。照今日的情形看來，如果再這樣演變下去，必至稍有能力者，都不願當敎師了。即使當敎　，也是暫時的，把學校當作旅館，是失業者的棲身之所。所以今日學生程度，日漸低落，想到這裏，不禁爲我們的第二代祖憂，不禁爲我們的國族前途痛哭！我們謹以最虔誠的心，希望當局從速改善敎師待遇，解決敎師生活，希望社會人士訊識敎師對國家民族的買獻而改變其輕視的心理，要知道敎師多一分努力，便替國家多培養一分元氣，趕快把目光放得遠一點，有所警惕！</p>
<p>其次，我們再就敎師本身說，抗戰八年，流離顚沛，戰後依然是困苦萬千，但大多數的敎師依然站住崗位努力，雖然有時有「命苦不如趁早死」之感，但到底能認淸自己的責任，刻苦奮鬥，那種堅忍的精神，實足當「師表」而無愧。敎師的人生理想，原不是一般人所能了解；敎師的人生價値，也不是一般世俗人所能估價的。此種「堅苦卓絕」「捨己爲人」的精神，便是我們民族精神所托。敎師本身原應該有這種抱負，這種信心。反之，敎師若失去了這種抱負和信心，又失去了以「學生的進步」和「轉移社會風氣」爲自己生命愉快的中心，則敎書的工作自然是味同嚼蠟了。尤可悲者，今日社會上也間或竟有以辦學爲名，而經商其實，亦有以敎書爲名，而騙飯其實者，貽害子弟，誤盡蒼生。德不修，行不講，學不精的人，怎樣能够領導兒童靑年而作社會的模範？又何以能够引起社會人士尊敬之心？雖然這些是少數，但我們在這莊嚴的敎師節日裏，希望能够把這些錯誤斜正過來。要社會人士都能「尊師重道」，先要敎師們都能自尊！</p>
<p>要之、敎師事業的本質是崇高的，所以値得我們景仰，其節日更値得我們慶祝。我們要呼籲社會人士認識敎師工作的本質，解決敎師的生活，提倡尊師，但敎師的本身也必得要充分表現其原有可使人油然起敬的學行。如此，則敎師節才能更有意義，更有價値。</p>

<h3>安理會續商印荷問題　決設仲裁委員會　吧城各領事將提供報告　法國行使否決權蘇聯建議被推翻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿六日廣播：安理會調解印荷爭端之建議，今日已由印尼正式予以接受，同時，關於由六國總領事監視停戰令之執行工作一項建議，亦由印尼予以接受，現各方咸注視荷蘭態度，但預料荷方將拒絕安理會之「斡旋」工作。又印尼贊成由荷印各選一安理會會員國，再由該兩會員國共選第三會員國，合組三國委員會，調解荷印爭端。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿六日電〕安理會今日重行開會，企圖結束印度尼西亞案。議程中首列者爲比利時代表之提議，請國際法庭裁定安理會對此案有無採取行動之權。波蘭代表亦提出一決議案，促令荷印兩國遵守停戰命令。蘇代表葛羅米柯對比提議痛加攻擊，一部份觀察家認爲葛氏或又將行使否決權。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿五日電〕法國今日在安理會中初次使用否決權，以推翻蘇聯所提由安理會成立一委員會，以監督印尼境內停戰令之議。五强除蘇聯外，在安理會中使用否決權者，尙屬第一次。蘇聯該一建議案表決結果，爲贊成者七票，反對者比法兩票，棄權者中英兩國。另一中國與澳洲所提令現駐吧城領事監督停戰令之其同決議案，以七興贊成通過，投反對票者無，棄權者英，蘇，波蘭，哥倫比亞四國。其先蘇代表葛羅米柯批評獎國所提關於設立仲裁委員會協助解決印荷爭端之建議，該議主張任命三國代表組織仲裁委員會，其中二國由雙方爭端當事人各指定其一，第三國由被指定之二國指定。葛羅米柯謂此乃企圖規避聯合國機構之典型例子，美代表詹森富起而反駁，並稱不信安理會之任何理事將鄭重懷疑美國之動機。經表決之下，以八票對零票通過美國之建議，蘇聯等三國棄權。今日辯論時，印尼代表沙利亦曾發言，請安理會承認荷蘭對印尼發動侵略行動，並令荷軍撤出印尼境界，沙氏對於令吧城之領事調査印尼局勢之議，表示極大懷疑，蓋此等領事官大多經由荷人之目以觀察事態。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿六日電〕聯合國秘書長賴依今日招待記者稱，安理會通過美國決議案決定派三人委員團協助解決印尼爭端，並未使爭執雙方常事人感覺熱烈滿意。印尼代表沙利承認安理會決定使印尼及荷蘭於任命三人委員團代表之際處於平等地位，爲印尼之勝利，但表示印尼仍認應由安理會整個處理此一事件。</p>

<h3>康白拉會議揭幕　美澳加出席代表致辭均主早日締對日和約</h3>
<p>〔路透社康白拉廿六日電〕不列顚共和邦討論日本和的之會議，已於今晨十一時在澳洲聯邦衆院內揭幕，共和邦全部除緬甸外，悉皆參加。澳總理齊夫萊以主人地位，代表澳政府及人民歡迎各與會代表。渠云，此等會議在一不列顛自治領內舉行，尙屬破天荒第一次。不但對於澳洲，即對於共和邦之每一構成部份，亦均具有特殊重大意義。渠對緬甸之未能參加揭幕會議，表示遺憾，希望其代表能及時趕到參加以後之會議。</p>
<p>大會旋即推選齊夫萊爲主席，繼即由澳外長伊伐特致開幕辭，渠對今日世界之尙處於旣非和平亦非戰爭的狀態下，表示扼腕。渠請與會代表沉思今日世界之悲痛現象，蓋舊的世界已吿死亡，而新的世界則尙未曾誕生，實不容予漠視。伊氏於述及對日和約時聲稱，「吾人應奮力以獲致者爲日本之公理及民主，不列顚共和邦歡迎美國在太平洋區之主動地位，吾人希望在美國領導之下，和平卒能蒞臨世界之此一部份」。英首席代表共和邦關係部大臣艾迪生繼起發言，對印度及巴基斯坦代表之蒞會，表示欣喜，並盼望此一愉快的和諧狀態，得以永遠存在。渠又重申英國不願日本獲得苛刻的和平，僅願其得有基於公理及民主之和平，但渠同時力言日本之帝國屬領，務必予以剝奪，防止培養其侵略之機構，良以日本在和平道路上之進展，已達如何程度，至今有猶疑問故也。艾氏繼曰，英國在戰爭早期即已同意美國之必須負起太平洋及亞洲區和平之道義責任，但此項同意並非表示英國將以其在太平洋區之合法利益移讓美國。渠囑與會代表勿忘日本爲太平洋之一部，故亦不可否認日本在此一圈子內之正當地位。加拿大代表克萊斯賴宣稱，在世界之一部保持和平，而另一部保持戰爭之狀態下，和平及繁榮，決不能建立於任何處所，故繁榮之之主要條件爲全面和平，希望各代表努力以求此一條件之獲得。紐西蘭總理弗萊塞則聲明此一會議，決非表示不列顚共和邦之結黨以抗美國，渠謂美國在太平洋之領導地位爲公認事實，不列顚共和邦不擬就此點再事爭辯，且當更事增强其地位，渠亦如艾迪生之呼籲平日成立對日和約。</p>
<h3>史巴克主張取消否決權</h3>

<h3>蘇外長覆文無補大局　美官方深表不滿　韓局有提交聯合國可能</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕權威方面稱：「若干官方人士」對將美蘇年餘不能打開僵局之韓國問題　與聯合國之主張，情緒日烈。又稱：美官員對莫洛托夫關於韓國之照會「失望之至」，並正討論採取徹底之計劃，解決韓國問題，使其臨時政府能統一全國。消息靈通方面稱：下週末「相當可能」有一非常重要之行動公佈。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫之覆文同意馬歇爾之主張，美蘇混合委員會應向莫斯科及華盛頓報吿討論之情形，惟此問官方認爲莫氏覆文對局勢毫無裨益。英氏且任馬歇爾所指定之委員會報吿期限（八月廿一日）過去，而不予答覆。莫氏對委員會現狀之觀察，使此問官員相信，欲依一九四五年十二月之莫斯科協定解決間題，已屬無望，即莫斯科華盛頓間之直接談判，亦不致有何效力，故美國解決此問題之能力大受限制。某一方面稱；美國現僅能將此問題遞還　討莫斯科協定之四外長會議，或提交聯合國，或逕在南韓實施經濟政治發展之計劃。</p>
<p>美蘇混合會昨恢復舉行</p>

<h3>免除購貨禁止歧視約束　英美已獲致諒解　伊第返國報告談判經過</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿五日電〕英內閣已於今夜結束兩星期來所召開之第二次緊急內閣會議，會後並未發表任何正式公報，以說明美國對於英國之請求停止適用借款協定中禁止歧視之條文，採取何種答覆。大部份觀察家則信，美國業已同意不視英國之不能遵守此款，爲違反協定之行爲。</p>
<p>同時據悉，內閣對於若干緊縮措施亦已成立決議，惟此等措施尙待艾德禮首相親自公開宣布。其先聞甫自華盛頓返抵倫敦之英財政代表團長伊第爵士曾赴唐寗街十號，惟渠並未進入內閣會議室，而係赴比鄰之財政部辦公室。伊第於扺達機塲時，對於在華盛頓成立之極端秘密決義，僅有些微暗示。渠云：「余赴美目的已吿達到，就禁止歧視之款之討論，殊有價値。英國所面臨之問題，已嘗以最可能之善意及諒解予以處理」。當內閣詳細檢討華盛頓談判之結果後，即可決定可以不必依據自美購買之比例，而任意向美國以外之他國購買。根據禁止歧視條款之規定，英國自他國購買之糧食原料，須視自美輸入減少之程度比例減少。</p>
<p>剩餘貸款予以凍結</p>
<p>今英國向美貸款，大部份已吿用罄，餘者亦被凍結，故英國之輸入必須減至與出口所獲相等。華盛頓今日透露，英國今日再支美國貸款一億五千萬元，星期五可再支一億五千萬元，其尙餘之四億萬元，即將予以無限期凍結。</p>
<h3>保議會批准和約</h3>

<h3>最後消息</h3>

<h3>受害木器商聲明簽字具結係出誘脅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕直接稅局査賬員勒索舞弊案，據局長樓國威前日聲明，該局自行派員調查時，牽涉之七家木器商號中，有六家已具結證明並無勒索舞弊情事。茲悉，前述六家中式木器業商號，昨日委託馬君碩律師致函樓局長，鄭重聲明前之簽字證明，係出於誘脅，於法不生效力。其原函云：「逕啓者，據當事人朱根記號朱劍霓君，五福號曹才賡君張，森茂號張賢良君，萬泰號張壽祺君，及楊隆興號楊隆泉君來所委稱：敝號等經營中式木器照章納稅，不料前有本市直接稅局査賬員兪·張·劉·張·高·謝。王及楊等十人，向敝號等藉端威脅非法謂索，會報由同業公會張理事長中原轉陳市參議會潘議長，向財政部揭發，並經決定派員澈査在案。詎該局職員閱報載消息後，情虛畏却，竟用迅雷不及掩耳之手段，於本月二十三日前來敝號等多方誘脅，囑令簽字證明該局職員過去並無要求賄賂情事。敝號等以當時潘議長及張理事長均未返滬，深恐反遭毒手，不得不暫時容忍。但過去該局職員索賄行爲，事實具在，無可狡賴，旣經潘議長向中央據實揭發，該局對於有關職員正應依據事實從嚴處理，斷非憑此欲蓋彌彰之紙條所能抹煞一切。矧不眞實之意思表示，於法不生效力，對於敝號等之依法舉發，自無拘束可言。上述各點應請貴律師函達本市直接稅局局長鄭重聲明，並請嚴行査辦，以肅官紀而障商民等語。據此相應函達即希査照辦理，並希見復爲荷。」</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕江蘇省主席王懋功前晚偕建設廳長董轍，社會處長鈕長耀，新聞處長張玉麟自鎭來滬，昨在江蘇省銀行招待所，向本市各報記者報吿蘇北之嚴重災情，略謂蘇北三十六縣中，受災者計十七縣，六千萬畝耕田中，半數爲大水淹沒，其中二千萬畝已完全淹沒。估計此次災民至少有五百萬。受災各縣，如立秋前大水不退，則今年收成絕望，將發生嚴重之糧食問題。中央對蘇北災情極爲關懷，已撥款二百八十億救濟，省府並請行總撥麵粉一萬噸急救，但迄今行總僅允撥一千五百噸，殊嫌不敷。王氏對本市過去救濟蘇北難民及對此次水災之關切，深表感謝，仍盼各界踴躍救災。明日午後二時將假浦東同鄕會舉行江蘇省水災急賑委員會成立大會，招待本市各界，報吿蘇北災情，並有水災照片數百張展覽。</p>

<h3>百萬遺產應徵稅稅額最高推洽老　稅局進行側面調查已定百餘單位</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕擁有四百多萬人口的大上海，一天二十四小時中，每時每刻有人死亡，有人出生，根據市政府民政局的統計，每月人口的死亡數字至少也有一千六百餘人，除去路斃與普通階級不計外，假定全上海二十個殯儀館，每家每天平均有一位擁有資產的主顧，一年也得有七千二百多位資產階級死亡，這些死者都是直接稅局稽徵遺產稅的良好對象。（按遺產稅征收起點爲一百萬元故有此資格者當不乏其人）去年一年到今大，上海直接稅局已査定的遺產稅共有一百多個單位、正在調査中的也有幾十個單位，在已査定的一百多個單位中，稅額最高的，首推虞洽卿，洽老於民國卅四年春季病故在重慶時，本市尙未收復，他在滬的遺產於勝利後，才由其遺產整理委員會向直接稅局申報，據我們所知道洽老的不動產，如大上海電影院，四馬路京華酒家，廣西路福致里，靜安寺路重華新邨等，都是著名的良產。</p>
<p>虞氏兄弟小小糾紛</p>
<p>本年四月間，洽老的遺產在他的順恩，順懋，順慰三位公子間，曾經引起一段糾紛。在靜安寺路成都路附近，洽老置有房地產二起，共計面積十二畝零六厘六毫（包括金魚商塲），本由老大順恩經管，遺產整理會議席上，順恩忽向二位阿弟提出報吿，說該處房地產已在二月間以黃金一百五十八條的代價出售他人，順懋，順慰認這事有點蹊蹺，若照時値佔價，這裏的房地產要値黃金一千多條，十倍於順恩報吿的數目，雙方各不相讓，一時鬧得很兇，後來由大姊丈江一平出面調停，始得免於訴訟。我們從此一端，可以窺測虞洽卿遺產豐富之一斑了。但遺產稅法上規定，遺產的估價，以遺產被繼承人死亡日期價値爲標準，所以治老的遺產稅額並不那麽驚人，不過也不太少，大槪也有二三十億元吧！</p>
<p>施省之稅額經決定</p>
<p>虞洽卿之下要算沈聯芳了、沈聯芳的名字，在上海也不很生疏，他是絲繭業的鉅子，曾任江浙皖三省絲繭公所董事長，上海總商會副會長，閘北慈善團總董，他的事業如華安水火保險公司，恒豐絲號，江陰利用紗廠，上海豐業保險公司，中國絲業銀行，蘇州太和麵粉廠等，在本市有住宅，地產不少。他的遺產總額雖然不及虞洽卿，但死亡日期在虞之後，依時値估價定稅，所以他的稅額，與洽老差不了多少。</p>
<p>外交界耆宿施肇基的長兄施肇曾，號省之，是今年去世的，享年八十二歲。他在前淸做過知縣，至二品銜江西道員，曾任駐美紐約正領事，回國後任職於鐵路界，歷任湖北漢陽鐵廠提調，兼辦京漢鐵路工程，滬寗鐵路總辦，招商局總董。民國初年再度出任外交官，於民國十一年　政從商，創設閘北水電廠，永亨銀行董事長，久安實業公司等。施省之善爲官也善經商，他的遺產也着實可觀，施氏的子侄，很瞭解國家法令與納稅義務，在限期內編造遺產淸册，直接稅局很順利的決定了他的稅額。大新振漂印染織造廠總經理史久茂，在寗波旅滬同鄕中也是著名人物之一，他是小東門愼泰昌棉布號練習生出身，民國二十五年開設大新振漂印染織造廠，同慶棉布莊，中國投資管理公司總經理，他的遺產稅雖然較少於虞，史，沈，施，但也少不得要幾億元。</p>
<p>善於經營的姨太太</p>
<p>直接稅局正在調査中的著名單位，如在重慶亡故的本市戰前紗布交易所理長穆藕初，他的主要遺產是德大，厚生兩個紗廠。最近逝世的五洲藥房總經理項繩武，大中五金機器廠經理徐德新等。其中遺產最富，直接稅局這幾天正在全力調査的是四明銀行總經理孫衡甫之妾孫張譬如。這位女太太生前善於積　經營，她在長寗路五角塲置有房產廿餘幢，愚園路，極司非而路各有住宅洋房一幢，轎軍，吉普車各一輛，並置有穿山輪船公司，麵粉廠等股份，在故鄕慈谿也有住宅，田畝，市房。四明銀行的保險箱，還有不少首飾，金條，鑽戒。稅局除通知孫張璧如的遺產繼承人申報外，同時進行側面調査。</p>
<p>便宜羅迦陵繼承人</p>
<p>遺產稅在中國可以說還是一種新稅，抗戰時期在後方雖於民國二十九年七月一日實行了，但在收復區還是民國卅四年九月二日開徵的。稅法規定凡死亡人在卅四年九月二日以前死於收復區者，其遺產在收復區部份免稅，所以便宜了哈同夫人羅迦陵的遺產繼承人。但在二十九年七月一日以後死於後方者，無諭其遺產在後方或收復區均一律課稅，如虞洽卿，穆藕初都如此。立法院通過遺豫稅法時沒有料到法幣會如此貶値，所以遺產稅的起微點，規定是一百萬元，最近稅署曾決定提高到三千萬元，但物價不斷的向上漲，三千萬元在今日又顯得渺小了，所以稅署還在考慮修訂。</p>

<h3>水鄕旱災　錢塘江兩岸　泥土龜裂和葉枯　浙東山區　災象更形嚴重</h3>
<p>海寗桐鄕諸縣黃泥水作飮料</p>
<p>目前災區廣布錢塘江兩岸，浙東西各縣據報旱災成象者計有：杭縣·海寗·海鹽·餘杭·嘉善·嘉興·臨安·樂淸·蕭山·諸曁·餘姚·鄞縣·黃岩·宣平·溫嶺·永嘉·臨海·桐鄕·　陽·武　等十縣，幾乎要達到全省三分之一的教目。杭·嘉·湖·一帶鐵路以北尙好，鐵路以南，地土龜裂，已成普遍現象，河床乾涸，汽船亦無法開駛。尤其糟的是各縣飲料大成問題，如海寗，桐鄕等縣，祇能混濁的黄泥水，這對於農民的健康，將會大受影響的。但是他們祇要有水吃已很高興了。在海寗·袁牧·城北·翁埠·許村等有些地方·洗臉·沐浴·已無水可用，吃茶也已經成爲了一種奢侈的事受。路人口渴，向鄉人討水，要跑上好幾家，才能得到二酒盅黄泥水。因此，村裏沒有了閒人，男女，老少，連孩子們也拿了水桶甚至瓦水　，跑到十幾里外的錢塘江邊去挑水吃了。這種苦辛，是在城裏吃自來水的人萬萬想不到的。</p>
<p>抽水機五十架盼即運浙救災</p>
<p>本來杭·海一帶的田，都要靠西湖水來灌溉。杭州人託西子之福，把湖水送給杭海諸縣，而把田糧也讓他們負担了。今年上塘河一帶成災後，市工務局於十六日起即開放西湖水，但據沈局長說：「十六日起，放水廿四小時後，水位已低落五公分。共放六十八小時，水位低落十·五公分，計放出湖水五十萬七千立方公尺。惟天時亢旱，蒸發量和滲透量極大，上塘河水位僅漲高二公分至三公分，湖水僅到臨平附近之小毛橋，距杭州廿三公里，距海寗尙有廿九公里。」由於周市長對西湖的熱愛，他好像頗吝於開放湖水，因此開開停停，好像祗是應付與論，廿二日沈主席親往上塘河視察災情後，即令再開放十天，同時請自來水廠汲水機多開工四小時，將水汲入上塘河。另一方面，行將結束的行總浙江分署，向塘江局借了三架六吋的抽水機，在長安汲水帮助灌漑，同時，孫·祝·二署長和建廳皮廳長連袂去滬，請行總將原定配售浙江之抽水機五十具從速運浙，以救旱荒。其中二十架機件，巳到杭市，候另件運達後，即分配杭嘉湖一帶災區應用。其餘三十架，到杭後，則擬分配其餘浙東西被災各縣，義務抽水。</p>

<p>但是受災各縣，不但要水，而几是急於要水。如果馬上有足够的水灌漑，秋收已要打個七折；沒有水呢，收成當然要絕望了，而且許多農民對錢塘江水並不信任。因爲它是鹹性的。民國廿三年大旱災的時候，農民也用過江水，結果呢，禾枯穗不實，仍是大大的歉收！何况農民限前就需水，而抽水機還在復興島呢！據宣平農民的估計：秋收的工資每工要一萬二千元，每畝需四工，供膳折穀一担，每畝播種施工，肥料等折穀二担，田租每畝二担，如果每畝仍能收穫五担，尙要虧損一担多。有些佃農還是借債種稻的，借一担，要還一担半，年成好，也頗拮据，如今旱災，生活就不堪設想。他們在無可奈何中，祇得把命運委之於神，現在武義，溫嶺，鄞縣，諸曁，樂淸，海寗等，都在求神祈聖，迎龍求雨，有些地方，抬了菩薩往災區巡視，想感動菩薩的心，降點甘霖，但是雨沒有下一顆，錢到用了不少。有些地方是公征的，每畝二萬元，從這個基數，就可想見耗費之鉅了。省府目前還在作積極的搶救，（其成效須視進行的速率而定）還未作消極的救濟計劃。他們希望農民改種雜糧以補救食糧的需要。但農民們在歉收旱災的情况下，應付了征實征借之外，仍要靠自己的雜糧來茍全性命，恐怕已成爲一種困難的事悄。因此，我深望當局能有更深一層的救濟計劃，來解救浙江農村當前的苦難。民國廿三年的大旱災勢將重演，但我們深望能少讓多難的溪民們受些苦難。（記者黄行天）</p>
<h3>嘉興苦旱</h3>
<p>〔本報嘉興廿五日訊〕連日天旱無雨，本縣各鄕鎭，田土均已龜裂，且虫災頻仍，災象已成，尤以早作物如蕃茹，綠蔴，甘蔗等類，損失更重，如週內再不降雨，秋收殆將絕望矣。</p>
<h3>臨平旱災區　築塘蓄水待價而沽　救活一畝田農作物需費竟高至卅萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿四日訊〕在餘杭，農村裏實施蓄水灌田，受益的可以有三千餘畝，但這數量太少了，別的地方也根本無水可蓄。即使稍有可蓄的，也被私人佔據了。這裏有一個故事：臨平一帶，有農人築塘貯水，待善價而沽凡用舊式人力車水欲汲塘水灌溉者，則水車轉一百次，即需付款六萬元。人力水車的效能是很低的，據農民的實際經騐，這一百轉的水量，僅足灌漑二分田，那就是說：要救活一畝田的農作物，需費三十萬元，約値市價一担米。這在普通的農民，已無力負祖，祗好讓結穗的禾稻任其枯黄。有些種甘蔗的，因爲護利較豐，故競相雇工灌漑。但等塘水汲空，上塘河一帶的田還是不免要荒蕪的。</p>

<h3>市府昨開校長會議決定　私校收費最高額　小學五十萬初中八十萬高中百萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市私立中小學下期徵收學雜費標準，經私校自行決定，爲小學六十萬，初中九十萬，高中一百二十萬後，一般學生家長均感標準過高，不勝負担。市府特於昨日下午三時半，在會議室，召集私立中小學校校長百餘人舉行會議，商討酌减收費辦法，由敎育局長顧毓琇，副局長李熙謀等，陪同吳市長主持。首由吳市長致詞，略謂自私校學雜費數額發表後，連續接獲學生家長請願信數十封，皆以私校收費過高，並指出若干學校經費不公開，表示反對。經調査後，發現南洋中學經費完全公開，存放利息，均分給敎師，相反者，若干私校經費，全由校長一人支配，而敎員生活則苦不堪言。此兩種相反情形，已獲確切證據，決定分別予以獎懲，須知外界對私校有「學店」之稱，而提出「反學店」之口號，實爲政府及敎育界之最大羞辱。吳氏以憤怒之口吻稱。余決定請該校董事會撤換校長，以樹立敎育界之淸高風格。吳氏嗣對各私校所設之免費額，多名實不符，低者僅佔百分之四，甚且有將外界所捐之助學金充作本校免費額者，至堪憤慨。繼由校長蔣紀周，崔堅吾等報吿私校訂定學費經過稱：當時因外匯不定，誠恐物價變動，故所訂數目略高，同時鑒於私立大學收費提高，中小學不能不增加，吳市長即席斥爲商人習氣，收費數目應適合本身之需要。嗣經熱烈討論結果，議決要點如下：（一）上次座談會中，決定半費及免費額應足額，經濟應公開，收費應存指定銀行，利息悉充學校開支，並將經費百分之七十，付給敎職員薪金，以上各項必須嚴格照辦。（二）各校收費最高額：小學五十萬，初中八十萬，高中一百萬。但歷史悠久，設備完善，成績優良，經濟公開之中小學，經呈請敎局核准，可照六十萬，九十萬，及一百二十萬之數收取。（三）學期中途，各校不得擅收任何費用，若有不遵敎局規定，巧立名目，浮收虛報等情事，一經察覺，敎局定予嚴處，或收歸市辦。</p>

<p>糧食部公佈京鎭滬三口岸　麺粉限額轉口辦法　八月份四區轉口粉定為卅萬包　　糧食部爲配合國家總動員法令，對長江各省之糧食流通，應即加以管制，以上海米榖小麥麵粉四項主要糧食，於去年先後奉行政院令飭，須事先報經該部核准，方得轉口。又本年四月間江蘇省內上述四項糧食，因大量採購外運，刺激糧價暴漲，經規定各縣市凡穀米小麥麵粉在蘇省境內及運京滬者，准其自由流通。其運往他省者，應一律經該部核准。最近該部曾迭接各方呈請弛禁，業經該部規定如下；（一）上海米穀外運，仍照院令核准之由滬報運米毅轉口辦法辦理。（二）上海小麥出口，仍暫緩弛禁。（三）沿江各省糧食，應絕對自由流通。惟運往長江口外至其他沿海省區銷售者，應報經該部核准，始可出口。（四）京滬兩市及蘇省麵粉，自八月份起，遵照政院核准之麵粉限額轉口辦法，由該部參酌產銷情形，逐月公佈轉口數量。聞本月份已經核准第四區轉口麵粉數量爲卅萬袋。茲簡錄麵粉限額轉口辦法如后：　　（一）爲充裕平·津·靑·浙·閩·粵等南北各省市民食，並爲發展麵粉工業起見，自卅六年八月起，麵粉轉口採取限額報運轉口辦法。　　（二）麵粉報運轉口，指定以上海鎭江南京三口岸爲限。　　（三）每月報運轉口限額，由糧食部査酌產銷情形，核定公佈，並通知各有關機關團體査照。　　（四）糧食部所核定每月轉口限額，交由第四區麵粉業同業公會（以上簡稱第四區粉業公會）按各廠生產量公平分配，詳細列具分配表，報請糧部備核。限額之外，仍禁止轉口，但經糧食部認爲必要，特准報運者，不在此限。　　（五）凡屬於第四區粉業公會會員，開設在江蘇省內及京滬兩地之廠商，均得申請報運轉口。福新阜豐·茂新·華豐·裕通等五廠，由糧食部另行定額轉運，不在此項限額分配之列。　　（六）儿業經辦理糧商登記，領有糧食部營業執照，經營糧食迷銷業務之各地糧商，得購迷麵粉外銷。但仍由承售商代爲申請報運轉口，其是否合法糧食運銷商，由承售廠商負責保證，各級政府機關對於當地糧商所發採運證，一律無效。　　（七）廠商申請報運轉口，不論自運　售予合法糧商運銷，其數量不得超過第四區粉業公會所分配之數量。但上月份分配數量尙有餘額時，准予合併計算。　　（八）報迷轉口口岸，由廠商自行選擇。麵粉起運前，報請糧食部核轉轉口地海關或稅務機關査騐，准予放行。　　（九）前條所稱海關稅務機關，在上海寫江海關，在南京爲金陵關，在鎭江爲鎭江貨物稅局。海關未接糧食部通知時，不予放行。鎭江貨物稅局未接糧食部通知時，不予簽發稅單。　　（十）凡合法廠商由本辦法第五條規定地區以外之長江上游各省市購運麵粉，經長江口轉還至沿海各地者，應先呈明購銷地數量並檢具糧商執照及麵粉廠證明，報經糧食部査核，准許後，通知當地海關或稅務機關放行。　　（十一）糧食部調迷麵粉接濟軍糧民貪，由上海總倉庫報請糧食部轉知江海關放行，不受本辦法之限制。　　（十二）本辦　自公佈之日施行。塲外對敲活躍華股賡續前進　　華股昨賡績邁進，中途得物資金匯之刺激，楊某在塲外補空四千萬股。塲外對敲大戶，如魚得水，喊價猛抬至二五二元以上。於是塲內亦被迫猛漲，近午俏後有回，良以空方抵補完竣，浮多亦有了結也　　晨開見穩，遞永紗開後，二一九號等乘高賣出，嗣因一二號七三號二二四號一〇二號八五號來進，一三〇號並進現永紗，乃升至二四〇元。供源不斷，致高價難於持久。後以塲外息價忽高至一角半及一角九分半，拋售者多，曾低至二三二元及二三二元。此時買方陣容突然轉盛，楊某更在塲外大量補空，享鼠牌又任意將喊價抬高至二五二元以上，乃漲到二四九元及二五〇元高價。近午高潮過去，午收回跌至二四三元及二四四元結束。收後喊價平和，午後爲外喊高至二五〇元弱，結果較前收即交股計永紗信和永公漲‘半成，美亞華豐勤興新光景福微升，新華中法平平，新亞跌一成，內衣中絲漲半成，麗安景綸均平，大通微挫，餘均微升。遞交股計永紗永公漲半成，新光微挫，景福勤興尙平，信和美亞華豐微升。塲外各老股計中華世界閘北五洲各漲半成，餘尙平定。九月十六日起增加後市交易　　〔本報訊〕本市證券交易所第廿三于次常務理事會，於昨日下午五時許，在該所會議室舉行。到全體常務理事，由理事長社　主席，討論至六時卅分散會。昨日會議，首由理事會秘書陳績孫報告上次理監會提案，證交不總經理報吿最近所務狀况。最後討論議案二起：（一）獎學基金管理委會組織條例，待擬就後，提出下次會議討論。（二）自九月十六日起，增加後市交易。交易時間，上午九時半至十二時，下午二時至三時半。統債激漲外股步升　　公債昨以某律師委托業內人連績吸收，引起非份之想者迫購，統丙晨開一四六〇〇元。自一四五〇〇元起，由五五〇室六一四室買進，漲到一七五〇〇元。二三〇號五〇三室有售，退至一六三〇〇元左右盤旋。統戊由國信出龍，自一四八〇〇元退至一四〇〇〇元內收市，成交約一千萬。結果較前收計甲乙戊各升二千元，統丙漲一千五，統丁好起二千四。　　外股昨得金匯及物資之　爲呼應，買風亦盛，洋行帮雖售，廣幫及金號業均進，證券帮出後復進，怡紗晨開八七五〇〇元，即吿步升至九〇五〇〇元左右結束。結果較前收計業廣鋼業祥泰各漲半成，餘均微升。經檢注意物價趨勢　　日來各項物價漸有波動，經檢當局，極爲注意，連日派出大批幹員，赴各處巡視，嚴拆對講電話等，從事收集有關資料，以供硏究對策。食米上落甚狹　　昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千四百餘石，市况早平午堅，結果定局粳秈米均少上落，惟糙秈略呈活洛，新粳新秞亦少變動，陰元見挺。　　麵粉南北洋均有問津，廠方售心益堅，績漲三四千元。雜牌粉亦加三四千元，統粉幣起千元，洋粉則績有拋售，仍居平平。麩皮執貨者扳價甚力，猛躍三五千元。豆餅徵升千元，黃豆產區頻升，客心頗堅，油廠吸胃　聯，市勢明定　緊。　　綠豆趨勢軟化，蠶豆疲中徘徊，中次　疲三四千元。元麥來去　稀，市形平平。紅糧去化呆滯，回跌五六千元。新貨即將湧到，未許樂觀。苞米消路不振，步削二三千元。芝蔴洋莊有　，市勢稱固。生仁漲定，莞豆去化不爽，定中幣疲。　　油市堅平互有，生油因甬帮動辦，猛漲二三萬元。菜油跟漲萬元，淸油亦加一二萬元，蔴油供求兩少，無甚變化。豆油來貨尙接，廠方供應不斷，暫無彼動，平正之格。外匯行市不動　　〔本報訊〕外匯平衡基金委會，昨日核定美英匯基凖價，仍維日前原價。故指定銀行對美英匯之買賣行市，仍無變動。汕輸公司負責打撈　「黑潮丸」油輪　　台灣高雄港內沉有「黑　丸」大油輪一艘，載重一萬噸，係於戰時被炸沉沒。台灣航業當局初以無甚用途，曾開始將其解體，事經政府知悉，以國內油輪正惑萬分缺乏，乃電魏主席轉飭制止，並派員前往査勘。該輪係日本昭和十四年建造，船齡僅六年餘，速率甚高，爲國內外有數之大油輪，予以解體，實屬可惜。現悉政府已責成中國油輪公司趕速打撈修復，增加油運力量，並聞修理工程計劃，業已擬妥孩定，日內即可施工云。百合干續升　　百合干茲以粵帮時有採辦，行存漸缺，而價格較低，貨主未能保本，故市勢逐漸回上。昨市行盤又升三四萬元，售至七十二萬元，亦無多數供應。中信局收購外棉共三萬六千餘包　　〔中央社本市訊〕關於收購到埠無許可證外棉，自八月十五日截止由請以後，中央信託局方面曾召開審査會，隨即與各申請紗廠進口商及棉花商訂立購售合約，載至廿六日止，總數三萬六千餘包，內大部份係將CIF外匯價款由國行電匯國外廠商，此問經辦之外國銀行及外籍進口商均表示滿意，認爲到埠幾將一年未解決之縣案，政府體恤商艱，一旦子以解決，對於我國國際貿易前途不無裨助。中信局方面日來屢與各代紡紗廠接洽交紗問題，據悉：各廠可先墊交一部份棉紗，以供外銷。其餘於一個半月內交淸，幷希望於短期內將棉花所付外匯收回而有餘資云。實銷活動生產漸減　紗布市價日見高漲　紗廠聯合會籲請增加電力　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司總經理束雲章昨語記者：日來紗布市價跳漲，雖因實銷漸見活動，但目前生產量之日减，亦爲最大原因之一。生產量减少主因，即爲電力供應不暢。就紡建公司在本市所有之紗錠而言，若電力能儘量供應，則日夜工司開足八十四萬錠。現因電力不足，致最近平均日夜工，僅能開足六十餘萬錠。故亟盼市府當局，對生產事業電力之供應，應積極設法，特別應從節約奢侈及無謂之電力消耗着手云。　　〔又訊〕全國紗廠聯合會，日前亦電呈行政院，　請設法增加各地生產事業電力，傳便增產，而使物價平穩云。　　棉紗再漲　　昨日棉紗市况，因逃港資金流回來滬，以致銀根據濫，市上業外人拉提甚勁，客帮實銷亦已發動，進胃甚強，市勢飛黃騰達，一路上揚。　　四二支監鳳近二千萬大關，收價徵回，最後爲一千八百九十萬元，比上日續漲五十萬。二十支特雙馬亦步升六十萬元，爲一千三百二十萬元，輕雙馬軋升六十五萬，爲一千二百零五萬元。其餘各支粗細紗亦均上升五十萬至八九十萬元不一。　　棉布買多　　昨日棉布市勢，漲風益熾，客帮及本街染廠採購低檔細布，致激動業中人及浮戶，一致爭進，執貨者扳抬，行情益呈俏利。十時半許龍頭細布漲高至四十九萬四千元，嗣聞紡建公司開布價掛低，獲利稍有吐售，最後爲四十八萬五千元，比上月續漲一萬五千。五福彩球陽鶴等各檔細布，亦均挺升一萬五至三萬一千元。四君子及金蓮妙舞　嘰，以紡建嗶嘰未曾開售，故價激升三萬元左右。其他漂布粗布元布花布及藍布士林布等一致上揚，自五千至三四五萬元不等。　　紡建售布　　中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售五七三七〇疋，被單四九〇條，申購單共九七五張，內　商四八張，購布七九一〇疋，布號九二七張，購布四九四六〇疋，被單四九〇條。　　棉花上揚　　昨日現棉因棉紗上漲甚烈，人心振奮，本街紗廠猛力扒吸，外埠客帮亦　起添辦，市價上揚。同業互相競購，市况頓形好轉，惟客阪以今日銀行封關，頭寸不能抵用，一部份貨物尙不肯脫手，全日交易甚旺，成交在二千五百包左右，各檔做開送廠價：書寶二一五萬，二一八萬，白洛去二一三萬。棧交價靈寶二〇八萬，二〇九萬，二一〇萬，二一二萬五千，漢細一八八萬，一八八萬五千，一九〇萬，一九一萬，一九二萬。一九二萬五千，一九三萬，一九六萬五千，一九七萬。又漢細連城璧一九〇萬，八寶一九七萬，沙市一九二萬，火機一六八萬。周浦籽花每組三二萬八千，各檔市價較上日漲起每担五萬元。　　香煙猛漲　　昨日捲煙漲勢更見瘋狂，初問價即　升，中途同業搜吸，貨主不肯輕吐，行情　做越高。　　午市最後十支大英烟昂至一千五百五十萬元，比上日繼續狂漲二百二十萬元。老刀烟亦猛漲二百廿五萬元，華商烟隨彼逐流，步升亦巨。靑赤糖上漲　　昨糖市趨勢緊秀，續見上展。公會　盤，現貨二〇中砂白爲六十四萬元，升萬元，機單照加六萬九千元，四半白棧單加十六萬元，現貨七十九萬八千元，無甚上落。台赤因貨低軋缺，現貨升至七十五六萬元，漲二三萬元。汕靑高五十四萬元，計六十六包。海南赤貨特高開六十三萬元，升三萬許，計數十包。刁靑號存漸薄，到貨又稀，零星開至五十萬元，升三萬元。同行劃五十一萬元，興化白袋裝好貨七十一萬元至七十萬元，簍裝六十八九萬元，普通六十六萬元，興赤五十七八萬元，成交五百件之　。　　糖果業要求配糖　　本市糖菓業配給食糖，間有少數同業所得到之配額，不敷需要。德發糖果廠陳子安等擬另組公會，期與當局發生直接關係，俾可得到相當配給而减輕成本云。　　新紙幣一批到滬　　〔本報訊〕太古藍烟囱公司Eumaeus號，前日自利物浦到滬，除運來大批五金什貨外，又有新紙幣一百六十箱，業已通知中央銀行提取。又太古公司南昌輪，昨自暹羅來滬，由曼谷還來枕木二萬七千五百根，該項枕木係淮南鐵路局採購。第六區棉紡公會　續開會員大會　議决要案四項　　〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡公會，於昨日下午二時，舉行定期會員大會二次延續會議，到會員八十餘人，代表會員廠七十餘單位，由理事長王啓宇主席。重要決議案有四；（一）棉貸問題：議決函請四聯總處繼續辦理。（二）電力問題：決由理事會速向當局積極交涉，設法挽救危局。（三）出口問題：決議由民營廠方面，組　　營外銷機構，以利　布出口，一方面里請紡調會審核。（四）匯率問題：決議不如取消名義上之官價結匯，改用商業匯率，以切合實際情形，而配合國家經濟新政策。又該會擬訂之「　　收購國棉草案」，原則上已經通通，尙須理事會作最後修改及審核云。美金債劵本息到期即行支付　　〔本報訊〕頃據美金債券募銷委員會副秘書長范鶴言語記者：美金公債停售之事，業

<p>春秋孔子的文藝觀  王進珊　　以孔子誕辰爲敎師節，大槪因爲孔子會　學洙泗，「以詩書禮樂敎弟子，蓋三千焉；身通六藝看，七十有二人。」與我們敎書匠有同行之雅，於是「高山仰止，景行行止」，崇奉爲至聖先師，原來自古已然，這是沒有錯的。　　不過若僅以敎書匠的老前輩看孔子，這就未免小覷了孔子了。偉大而深廣的天才，本是多方面的，所謂「天縱之聖」，應不受任何名額的限制。若謂宇宙的象微是「神」，人倫的象徵是「聖」的話，那麽孔子就是東方精神史上最偉大崇高的紀念像，中國人倫的極峯。你說他是思想家也好，敎育家也好；你說他是哲人也好，詩人也好；他代表着我們　個的民族精神，這是我們値得驕做的。　　可惜自漢唐以來，學者多不免管窺　測，尤其在科舉時代，孔子一再被歪曲誤解，蒙上了一層道　面具。五四迷動中甚至於大倡打倒孔家店的口號；在當時爲了矯枉過正，尙屬情有可原。但，我們不想發揚民族文化則已，如要認識東方精神的偉大與高深，應先從孔子認識起。　　今日恭逢孔誕，依本刋性質。時錄「論語講劄」一章，藉備讀者認識儒家純文藝思想的參考和指敎。　　『小子何莫學夫詩：詩可以興，可以觀，可以羣，可以怨：邇之事父，遠之事君；多識鳥獸草木之名。』　　（論語，陽貨）　　詩，一種有節奏的情感，是文藝的原始細胞組成的文藝作品，也是一切文藝作品的基本原素。毛詩序中有這樣的話『詩者，志之所之也，在心爲志，發言爲詩。』詩歌固然是詩，小說戲劇散文也是詩，音樂舞蹈是詩，圖畫雕刻也是詩。　　就孔子的生活和思想方面看，所謂『老者安之，朋友信之，少者懷之。』和『不義而富且貴，於我如浮雲。』以及『浴乎沂，風乎舞零，詠而歸。』的精神，都不失爲詩人襟懷。　　然而孔子所說的詩，還只是指的民族初期文化中三位一體的詩·樂·舞的詩；但是這正是現代文藝的原始形式。而留傳至今，曾經孔子删訂的詩經，也許就是孔子當日敎學的詩歌敎材。——一部東方古代的詩歌總集；而今早已成爲民族　實。　　「興」「觀」「羣」「怨」，照文意講，乃在說明詩的功能，雖然「興」「羣」只是就詩的本質說明詩的功能，「觀」「怨」比較側重詩的社會的或政治的意義，但已全部說明了他學詩和讀詩的目的。孔子敎導他的兒子伯魚說：『女爲「周南」「召南」矣乎？人而不爲「周南」「召南」，其猶正牆面而立也與！』又說『不學詩無以言。』一則說讀了「周南」「召南」，可以擴大思想的領域和眼界；一則說，詩可以訓練我們的語言，豐富語言的餅彙。又如『誦詩三行，授之以政，不達；使於四方，不能專對；雖多亦獎以爲？』這便說詩敎通於言敎，誦詩授政，更通於出使四方。蓋辭令的縱橫出於「比」「興」，事實的敷陳出於「賦」，而觀風俗，知得失，則在乎「風」。　　「興」，孔潁達註『引　迎類』，朱熹註『感發意志』，照現代語法講，就是說，由聯想作用引起心靈共　，或是說由情緒的感應，充實精神生活。　　「興」字本義是「起」或「啓」，有引起動機或啓發的意思。可以和『啓予者商也』的「啟字」一樣看。更値得注意的是『啓予者商也』下面接着便是『始可與言詩已矣！』和另外一節對子貢講的『賜也始可與言詩已矣，吿諸往而知來看。』的兩段文字，這裏吿訴了我們孔子讀詩的方法。　　『興於詩，立於禮，成於樂』。更明確的把「興」字提出，說明了詩對於一個學人的立身，或是一個國家建國的過程中的地位與作用。毛詩序上不也說過「動天地，感鬼神，莫近乎詩』嗎　　「觀」，鄭玄註『觀風俗之盛衰』，朱註『老見得失』，朱註蓋根據漢書　文志『古有采詩之官，王者所以觀風俗，知得失，自考正也。』這也就是前面提及的『誦詩三百，授之以政』的說法。因爲文藝是表現人生，反映現實的，古時旣無新聞記載，也沒有社會調査，而民間的歌謠，也就成了施政參考。　　「羣」，孔註『羣居相切磋，』朱註『和而不流』，易乾卦文言所謂『同聲相應，同氣相求』，便是心理學上的物理作用，孔子也說過『以文全友，以友輔仁』。這還可以適用荀子說的『故樂者，天下之大齊也』的話來解釋。因爲文藝，尤其是文藝的基本原素的詩，是沒有人為的畛域可以限制它的流傳；而它的流傳更積極的溝通了人與人的心靈的呼應。　　「怨」，孔註『怨刺上政』，朱註『怨而不怒』，據爾雅釋詁，『議諫，怨也』鳥侃義疏謂『諷諫之法，方之者無罪，聞之者足戒，故可以怨。』所以這兒「怨」的含義，隱約有暗示意味，就是說，詩不是謾駡，不是咀　，當然更不是口號，而是一種深刻有力的人羣不滿現實的暗示。　　至於「事父」「事君」，只是說詩可以帮助我們了解家族關係，認識自已在家族中做子弟者的地位；可以帮助我們了解國家關係，認識自己做國民或官吏的責任。邢　註疏曾引證了詩經的章句，舉例說『詩有「凱風」「自華」，相戒以養，是「抵之事父」之道也；有「雅」「頌」君臣之法，是「遠之事君」之道也』。當然，忠孝，是我們民族的傳一統道德，需家的孔子固然不會忽略，而現代我們的解釋也不必拘泥。　　「多識於島獸草木之名」，皇疏言之最詳，『「　睢」「鵲巢」是有鳥也，「　處」「狼跋」是有獸也，「釆業」「葛覃」是有草也，「甘棠」「樸棫」是有木也，詩人並載其名，學詩者則多識之。」眞的，我們現代專寫「花兒月兒」體的詩人們知道的鳥獸草木之名也太少了。我曾經勸過學詩的朋友多讀讀生物學之類規書籍，現在才知道讀詩也可以學習些宇宙知識，於此更相信偉大的天才是多方面的。　　所以這節論語，總括起來，大意只是說靑年們應該學習詩。詩可以啓發知　和情感，（詩的啓發作用）詩可以表現人生現實，（詩的表現作用）詩可以感召人羣，可以互通作者與讀者的心聲（詩的慼召作用），詩可以發抒感情，更是現實反映，可供施政參考。（詩的抒情與暗示作用）。不但如此，而且可以使一你懂得做人道理，知道盡孝盡忠，也會增加你豐富的常識，記認一些動植物的名字。——約略說來，大略如此，然而微言大義，又怎是淺學如我者的短短千數百字的文字所能闡述！　　（八月二十五日黃昏）孔子凭几像尊孔  周崑　　通鑑日：周太祖謁孔子祠，將拜，左右曰：『孔子陪臣也，不當以天子罪之。』周主曰：『孔子百世帝王之師，敢不敬乎？，」一般靑年，不肯折衷於夫子，輕師毀道，而人才益滾矣。梧桐葉  玨人　　遷到武林門以後，天氣雖然仍很安熱，但因爲地區淸遠閒靜，却已經見出一點秋容了。　在鬧市中不大爲人門所易窺見和察覺，所以前人有折柳詞：「折取一枝人城去，呌人知道己春深」的話。秋，悄悄地來了，當人們在五更　曉的當兒，必有微凉之犀，可是秋陽一起，熱度又高，夏天的炎威，把人們早秋的快感，又驅逐走了，我們拿什麽吿訴人家秋已到來了呢？　　我們的一角小樓，恰恰面對着廣闊遼遠花木扶疏的秋圖，今天早晨被四風刮進一片梧　來，拾取把玩了一會，才深深感覺到秋的到來，更深深領會到詩意的侵襲。　　淮南子上說：「梧桐一葉落而天下知秋」張玉田祠：「只有一枝梧葉，不知多少秋　？」現在已是梧桐葉綠的時候了！想它在枝榦上顫抖着離別着　體那一瞬間是如何的悽楚啊！　　有花　和別　的人家，窗前栽着幾棵碧凈如洗的梧桐樹，一種　靜的趣味，籠罩着秋窗中人在績　，在撥墨，在品茗，在談天，他們雖然在幸福的環境裏，却不一定能十分體會，可是在想像中的我看起來，這幸福不是塵俗的，而是可愛的，可惜在杭州雖然有很多這樣的好環境，硬生生空閒着離蛛網　繞窗橋，讓蔓草遮蓋了花徑，主人們，這遠遠在上海或南京求行求利去了。梧業在空園中鹽零求侶，禁不住情感地飛越，慢慢踱到隣家的窗十裏來點綴秋光，情意着實可感。　　註得兒時在故鄉，白　的粉墻內，也是　着那麽兩棵高而且大的梧桐，枝榦高高地伸出墻頭，張開如巨人之黨的應大葉兒，密密　層，縣在半空似的，可望而不可即。夏天，坐在梧桐樹下，不但陽光不能晒下，而且自然有一種涼浸心脾的美味，令人心骨俱醉，尤其是一點點和忍冬藤相彷彿的細花　兒，落得滿階都是，濟香撲鼻。秋深了，便有一片片大葉飄飄而下積得厚厚的踩在脚下，沙沙發響，當然它們是枯黃憔悴地躺着，是被蹂躪的一幅可憐相了。　　小時候，我很愛吟幾句小詩，當用小刀在梧桐幹上刻着小字，梧桐樹皮綠凈且柔，很客易刻得進，年久日深，字蹟漸漸放大，當我在外埠過了幾年再回到家裏時便看到那字和我刻的時候，大大不同，它也一年年的增長起來，這是人們生活史的一種絕好的記錄啊！　　秋天到了以後，梧桐給與我們的繫念更深了。這時候桐花盡，桐果子小得和一粒粒圓而實的小　豆似的，委下地來。桐果子的香味和桐花一樣的呌我歡喜，而几它炒着可以乾吃，鬆脆可日，似乎比　豆更好吃些。一別十年的故鄉，如今値得我懷念的東西並不多，卻不料今天拾着一片似不遠之客的桐葉，使我憂鬱地懷想起它以外的若干事物。　　白居易詩：「秋雨梧桐葉落時，」我將要靜靜地等候它的聲音，它今天第一片關進我的窗子裏，難道是促起我的注意嗎？我得了這不遠之客的報告以後，很盼望秋雨快一點到來，但是一想到它所發出的棲棲切切的「秋聲」時，又不忍也不願它很快地到來了。（立秋後三日於杭州）獲麟歌  碧波　　「唐處世兮麟鳳遊，今非其時來何求？麟兮麟兮我心憂！」孔叢子云「叔孫氏之車子鉏商，樵於野，而獲麟焉。衆莫之識，以爲不祥。夫子往觀焉，泣曰「麟也。麟出而死，吾道窮矣」！因歌此作，以抒鬱。」盲人  史虹　　琤琤縱縱的弦音又響起來了，擊碎了凝集在我心底的渾然而空虛的寂寞。它使我歡喜，撩起窗帷，又是那偭背着布袋，提着小鑼的盲人。　　　衕本來是被冷落的鐵鎖深局着的，這時，像接待着一個隔閡了多年的老隣居，各人的臉上抹了一屢靑春的希望的虹彩。掩藏了他們習慣的羞澀，國着那忽起忽落地彈動的手指，請聽那一曲　　切切的弦歌，和一支支命運的故事。　　弦音，單調而零亂，恰像術七的語言。盲人，從灰白的眼膜裏辦認着一張張晃動着的臉；他看得見這些焦切的期待的表情嗎？不，他只是若無其事的彈着，他的預言是屬於上帝的。　　一個垂着雙有雙　的秀麗的姑娘，突然嫣紅了臉，轉過身子去。她難道不願聽見關於她的未婚夫的預言之歌嗎？脚跟兒站着不動，一陣陣的紅軍從頰際升起來；詩人從這裏汲取了可愛的讚美。　　盲人啊！你，無所求於自己的生命，部在坎坷的世途上撤下了希望的種子。一寸山河一寸血　386  葉勁風　　「喳…您哪」！這一聲對答，是充分表示敬意的口氣；大概也是現販現賣，倒是剛出籠的饅頭似的，熱氣騰騰，可惜出籠得太早了些，還有點騰夾生；字音全對，可是味兒不像。要照他原來的語彙和句法，可究全不是這一套。那麽，地爲什麽對　羣來這套「四不相」的官腔？大槪聽說　羣做了隊長，而他又是個戲迷……那「喳」字大槪是三本鐵公鷄偸來的…　　「五爺，着奶奶，老一輩的，咱這一輩的，一聽您二位回塞的信，都起了床，打算遠迎；可又不知這您凖走哪條道；趕凖信一到，才小半個時辰罷咧，趕巧今日是咱和武二哥的班兒，五爺一吩咐，咱哥兒倆快馬加鞭……這才…」老龍背台詞似的，一口氣說到這裏。　　「起動您二位哪，咱可不應該」！　羣勒住了馬，聽見老塞的人全驚動了，感覺不安，巴不得即時趕到才好；「悠二位快請上馬罷，咱們走着玩着…」　　「　，您哪！」老籠聽出糶羣的話言，應聲而答，「可是咱還得吿個罪，先走一步，報個實信兒，您哪…」玩着，便對那位武二哥一打手式，像戲台上脚色，應着鑼鼓點點兒似的，同時動作，好快身段；說聲「走」只一催馬，一手籠住轡頭，一手掛着鞍橋，而匹馬一前一後，早已放開蹄子，二人跟着搶了幾步，借勢一蹤，一順身，已經跨上了鞍子。這個動　剛畢，那馬早去了幾丈遠了。　　這位老龍並不姓龍，名呌馬如龍；他的祖父爲老回回，就是指點小老虎的母親練達摩拳着的那位老武師。老塞裏姓馬的佔最多數，惟有老能人緣最好，全寨老少男女誰都與歡他；第一，爲人和氣，誰有事，只一請求，不問這事他辦得了辦不了，他總應承下來；也眞去幹；到了辦不了的時候，他寗可求爹爹，吿奶奶，轉求別人，也決不數衍塞責。然而最受人歡迎的原因，還是那張嘴，就讓人樂，動手　　人笑的滑稽天性。老一輩的都呌他的小名龍兒，平輩呌他老龍，晚一張的呌他能老叔。雖有四十幾歲年紀，然而因他長年嘻嘻哈哈，倒只看得出三十多點，長得矮登登胖獨獨地，一顆腦袋却時別大，是一個「五短」的福相。滬濱絮語為敎師請命  十郞　　當敎育界喧嚷着敎師解　，待遇並薄，生活動盪不安的今天，要我們在「敎師節」作歌功頌德的文章，這是近乎　刺的。　　敎師値得尊敬，也値得　揚，但他們的生活，工作毫無保障；他們沒有硏究學術的環境，更沒有一間好好地實騐室與標本室。他們在講壞上，指手劃腳，口苦舌乾，所能換得的，是社會上對他們的冷淡，與菲薄得不足以糊口的薪金。　　他們能够向誰去使訴？　　這個學期終了，却又憂慮着下學期是否會得到聘書？個人的好惡，與私人的關係，常可決定一個敎師的「褒貶」。社會上如若還有「公平」兩個字，在淸苦的敎育界，常常是被抹煞的，　　要普遍提高中國的敎育水準，我們必須尊重敎師。不單使他們生活安定，而且必須得到工作上切實的保障。以下這些問題，敎師們的答覆，能有幾個是肯定的：　　每學期開始，每一個敎師可否領到本學期的薪金？　　他們執敎三年五年以上，敎育當局給予怎樣的褒獎？　　他們的子女敎育費，是否得到更大的優遇？　　一個公立與私立中小敎師，他們的待遇是否完全公允？　　一個敎師的聘書績發與否，地的審査與執行，是否無偏無私？　　一個敎師在學校里，是否無條件可以得到他要硏究，參考，實騐的書籍與儀器？　　要使千百萬文盲在中國淸除，我們化在敎師身上的費用，還得大大地提高。　　在建設復員聲中，我們是應該把敎育與敎師放在第一位的。自由談所望於投考大學者  陳子展　　本年度京滬北平國立各大學招生幾乎沒有一個大學不感覺人滿爲患的，因爲報名的動輒靠近萬人，甚至一萬數千人，這可以意味着高中畢業生較往年爲多，尤其是意味着私立大學徵收學雜費太多，各學生家庭已經大都負担不起。同時學生家長也很焦慮着自己的子弟考不取大學，不免四處奔走，打聽大學裏有沒有和自己攀得上關係的人，於是請託說情的事就多了，大學當局和敎授們也就感覺難於應付了？　　目前各大學人學試卷是編號糊名彌封的，閱卷先生根本不知道那一試卷是那個所作，而且閱卷的人多，根本不知道那些號數的卷子會落于自己之手，想要替和自己有關係的學生多給分數絕不可能，即有此司能，這和敎授之爲人太不相宜，決不會做，旣憑試卷優劣錄取，錄取之時未拆彌封，則拆開彌封以後，如果那個考生成績太差，雖欲爲他帮忙也不可得，儘管考生就是自己的兒女，也只能憑試卷，憑運氣。我校長的女公子會投考兩次，不是僅差平均分數一分，就是僅差　　，校長從不託人情，敎授們審査成績亦從不賣面子。我想國立各大學的情形大都如此。因此我願投考大學的諸君莫希望單靠人情了。還有以爲大學試題可以先買的，據我在這裏服務十多年的經騐吿訴我，這簡直是妄想。　　投考的人太多，試卷多得可怕。在此大熱天閱試卷是一個苦差，卷子還未打開就會頭痛。如果有一本卷子字跡潦草，隨意塗抹，更要增加閱卷者的不快，一定要影響到這本卷子的分數，甚至不待看完，隨便給個壞分數，就把卷十拋下了，道個考生豈不倒霉？又又因爲人數多，試題必稍難。考生看見難題儘在思索，不知先擇容易的題目先作，等待時問到了，要用塲了，也許一個題且也沒有作完，這也是倒霉之事。我希望每個考生試卷寫得好，題目做得完全。　　考生志願考何院系自然以選擇和自己才性之相近者爲宜，不過一個人的才性，父兄師友固不容易知道，有時速自已也不容易知道，要待自己眞正努力學習了一些時候之後才會發覺。所以當報名之初，選擇一個號爲冷門的系，或許因投考的人少而得錄取。不過考取之後，就得努力學習，不要預存轉系的心理。不然，或因第一年成績不好而被開除，取因投機取巧而給師友一個最壞的印像，這都要影響於自己的前途。努力學習，強迫注意，一年二年之後，還是不感興趣，無甚成議。這再考慮轉系的問題不　，切記不可輕易轉系。七十二行，行行出狀元。凡一種學術能够在大學裏設一學系，即都有學習之價値，學習得好，不患無出路。如果學習不好，任你入了什麼號爲熱門的學系，畢業後，出路還是有問題。不患無位，患所以也立。不患人之己知，患不知人　　大學在暑期招生的最多，寒假招生的也有，只要你有志氣，不怕沒有投考的機會。一校落第，不妨考另一校；一年落第，不妨準備考第二年；國立的不易考，私立的或可僥倖。總之，考不取，切不可灰心。只要你把國英算理化等主要的考試科目準備好，只要你有志讀書，遲一兩年入學又何妨？　　希望有志人大學的靑年不怕硬考，不怕落第！學費與敎師生活  言平　　久懸米決的學費標凖，終於在顧局長的爲下一代呼籲「從輕發落」下，有了決定。—依上學期提高三倍，於是私立小學的收費，大槪以學費四十五萬，無費十五萬元　標　了。　　然而，這個標凖數，是否一般的家長所能負担，也是不能疏忽的問題！何况，一般以敎育爲幌予的敎育家，猶未能滿意哩！　　至於敎師的生活不能安定，當然也是絕大的問題，豈能祗偏向於减輕家長負担，而不顧敎師生活。况且私校敎師，不能和公校敎師同樣的享受實物配給，道授予了他們增加學費的藉口，剝削下一代的理由。　　敎師的生活，據筆者所知，正和各個家長的經濟情形一般的大分着軒輊！因爲私校的待遇，大半是晨入爲出的，單以上學期論，同樣一個私校敎師，最高待遇達百餘萬元，是低的僅二三十萬元，這樣的天差地遠，豈是局外人所能相信與明瞭？　　减輕家長負担，提高敎師待遇，在這樣背道的情形下，似乎難以兼顧和兩全的。其實，不難！　　我人若能探本求源，詳細的分析一下，便可知敎師生活的不安，旣非敎師本身的造因，也非學費受限制的影響，更不是家長們的不諒察，所以造成這局面的，皆由於魔障的作崇！　　先將十年前後的學費，計算一下：記得戰前南市區私立小學的學費大多是五元，雜費一元。而且前規定的是學雜費六十萬元，前後比較恰是提高了十萬倍。請問那樣東西，有如此的張風？米，柴，油，鹽，房租…只怕黑市的黃金，也還不到達倍數吧！潘議長必竟是上海市民的最高代表，對於所定的標准學費不能同意和緘默，主張抑低至半數，這當然是每個家長所深切期望的。　　再談敎師的待遇，二十六年份，最低的大槪是二十五元。倘使也提高十萬借，那麽，月薪就該二百五十萬元。再能六個月一次發給，豈非有一千五百萬元的整數，這樣的待遇，還能說淸苦嗎？即使抑低到半數，也勝過於一般公敎人員哩。　　所以目前敎師生活的不能安定，其原因皆由於經濟的不公開，與薪金的不能一次發給，致使敎員們，難以把固定的收入，應付漫　無止境的日常生活。　　筆者的愚見，學費的規定，應注意平民至否有負担能力；而對於私校的經濟情形，應予嚴厲的監督。「經濟公開」，「一次發薪」，必須責令實行，使魔障們不能繼續其技僅，敎師生活，才能安定。而怠敎，請願等行動，亦不會再見了！旅美什錦  徐菽圓　　街頭藥房　　美國各城市村鎭到處可見街頭藥房Corner　Drugstore（在路的轉角者爲多），這並不足以表示美國人多愁善病，需要服藥，也不足以證明美國人防患於未然，把藥店放在街頭，等候主顧上門，那末要那些藥房何用呢？說穿了大可發笑，美國藥房固然以賣藥爲主要營生，此外他們選賣冰洪淋·牛奶·菓子汁·三明治·熱狗Hot　Dog·郵票·化妝品·衣着用品·照相材料。你走進一藥房，當然不是爲了買藥，而是想喝盃冷飲可以在飲冰櫃外圓高椅上坐下，那個櫃　做沙泉Soda　Fountain，這是象微名詞，因爲汽水或可口可樂是從龍頭裏放出來的，當你坐上圓椅的當兒，就有櫃台內的小姑娘走過來問May　I　Help　You？或者What　Can　I　cofor　you？你說要一盃橘子水，一客Banana　Split，（中國沒有這東西，洋人餐館的　歐根本聽不懂，那是把剝皮香蕉切開，加冰淇淋胡桃肉櫻桃等等的玩意，我們就勉強　成「香焦劈」吧），她答應着去了，當她把東西端來的時候，如果不給你發票，得立刻付錢，有發票的可以向賬台付賬，這是一種規矩，平常這種藥房裏的冷飲概不易找到座位，後客立在前客的座後等候着，後客之後，又右後宮，你坐在座上，從大玻璃鏡裏看到背後站着男女老少一大批，任憑你怎樣老面皮，吃完就走，要想再呌一盃也頗不好意思。如果一盃汽水吃了十分鐘還未吃完，那後面大胆的客人，要催一聲Eh，Hurry　up，buddy（喂，老弟，趕快），不過在晚上八時以後生意比較清淡，將要打烊時，你可坐那裏坐上半小時，呌兩瓶汽水一客冰淇淋，和Fountain　girls（女招待之一種）攀談攀談，也是人生一樂。她們那時已不比白天那麼忙，正需要有男性和她們談談解悶，如果你是老顧客的話，化五分錢唱一張片子，就可和她在店堂裏跳一只舞，九點打烊，你也不妨約她出去吃宵夜（另有專吃宵夜的地方）或看電影，這種街頭藥房，一向被人用來作約會之所，因爲美國沒有茶館，藥房冷飲櫃地點適中，如果有一個單女子進來，呌一盃果子汁而並不狂喝，東張西望，坐立不安的樣子，一定在等候她的男朋友，不然的話，早已把菓子汁咕都咕都吃完，匆匆走了。在這種塲合最易結識朋友，那些女招待對於老主顧非常表示親善，大家熱透了，她會招待你到她家裏便鈑，把你平時所化的小賬都吃回來了，或者還有更多的報酬。街頭藥房是最惠而不費的地方，祗要你不惹人討厭，每天去坐一兩次是非常合乎情理的。（四）（四）頑貓阿咪（十二）  張樂平作</p>

<h3>Government Council Discusses Thrift - Implementation Measures Submitted for Review - President Zhang Proposes Establishing a Supervisory Committee</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 18th routine meeting on the morning of the 26th, chaired by President Zhang. The following important proposals were passed: (1) Organizational Regulations for the Administrative Regulations Review Committee; (2) Measures for Holding Weekly or Monthly Meetings in Government Agencies and Schools at All Levels; (3) Designation of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, respectively, as the Central Organizing Agencies for the Election of Supervisory Committee Members by Mongolian, Tibetan, and Overseas Chinese Compatriots; (4) The proposal to allocate 2% of the freight charges of ships traveling on the North-South Seas and the Yangtze River main line to the Two-Guang (Guangdong and Guangxi) Flood Relief Fund was resolved not to be added to the freight charges, so as not to increase the burden on the people; (5) Establishment of a city in Gui Sui (now Hohhot), but without adding quota of National Assembly representatives; (6) Payment for the China Textile Company's supply of military gauze and cloth in the 36th year of the Republic; (7) Emergency measures expenses for the three provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, and Gansu; (8) Food rations for the police in the two cities of Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin; (9) Special funds for North-South epidemic prevention; (10) Additional funds for the Resources Committee's barter trade to repay debts and purchase and transport minerals; (11) Funding for the repair of revolutionary memorial buildings such as Huanghuagang in Guangdong Province; (12) Additional regular expenses for the Lanzhou Central Hospital for the period from June to December of the 36th year of the Republic; (13) Additional unallocated funds for the Post-War Relief Fund; (14) Dismissal of Pang Songzhou, Political Vice Minister of the Food Department, due to other appointments, and appointment of Duanmu Kai as his successor; (15) Chiang Chung-cheng (Chiang Kai-shek), concurrently President of National Chengchi University, requested to resign from his concurrent post. Considering the avoidance of concurrent positions, Gu Yuxiu was appointed as his successor.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 26th discussed two major thrift proposals: one was to establish a thrift supervision committee, and the other was to limit the number of personnel based on the actual needs of each agency's operations. However, as further study was needed, it was decided to submit them for review again. The implementation measures for various thrift consumption items will be reviewed by a special review committee established by the Executive Yuan, and the above two proposals will also be handled together.</p>
<p>The thrift supervision committee was drafted in accordance with the handwritten instructions of Chairman Chiang. On the 19th, Chairman Chiang instructed Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun to "designate important personnel within the Executive Yuan to focus on overseeing and supervising government thrift matters. It is best to have a simple organization so that it can be responsible for implementation." President Zhang therefore decided to establish a thrift supervision committee and drafted draft organizational regulations for discussion at the meeting.</p>
<p>The content of the draft is as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan will establish a thrift supervision committee to oversee the implementation of the thrift consumption guidelines and related measures; (2) The committee will have one chairman, concurrently held by a member of the Executive Yuan designated by the President of the Executive Yuan, and twelve members. In addition to the Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan and the five Vice Ministers of the Ministries of Interior, National Defense, Economy, Transportation, and Social Affairs serving as ex officio members, the President of the Executive Yuan will appoint three members each from the Supervisory Committee of the Control Yuan and the members of the National Economic Council; (3) The committee will have one chief secretary, concurrently held by the director of the Sixth Group of the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan. The secretary and staff will be designated by the chief secretary from the personnel of the Sixth Group. When necessary, he may request the President of the Executive Yuan to transfer personnel from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, the Secretariat of the National Economic Council, or relevant ministries to assist; (4) The committee will meet once every two weeks, and the chairman will convene extraordinary meetings when necessary; (5) The committee may request reports from central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments on the implementation of thrift guidelines and measures for review; (6) The members of the committee should form groups of two and go to the central government agencies and major cities at any time to inspect the actual implementation of the thrift guidelines and measures. However, when performing inspection tasks, the members should recuse themselves from agencies related to them; (7) If the committee finds that central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments are not effectively implementing the thrift guidelines and measures, it may report to the President of the Executive Yuan for approval after a majority vote.</p>
<h3>Limiting the Number of Personnel in Each Agency - Drafting Two Implementation and Inspection Plans</h3>
<p>The limitation of personnel in each agency is based on the "Guidelines for Implementing Thrift Consumption Measures" passed by the State Council. The Executive Yuan formulated implementation measures and inspection methods, and drafted two plans, A and B, and invited the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Audit to jointly review and revise them.</p>
<p>Plan A is the "Measures for Each Agency to Implement Personnel Limitation and Review Based on Actual Operational Needs": (1) The number of personnel in government agencies and public enterprises should be based on the approved budget quota for the 36th year of the Republic, and no additional personnel may be added thereafter; (2) The inspection of personnel limitation should be strictly controlled in accordance with the procedures for budget and final accounts.</p>
<p>Plan B is the "Measures for Each Agency to Implement Institution Reduction, Personnel Limitation, and Inspection Based on Actual Operational Needs": (1) Each ministry, commission, provincial, municipal, and county government, and its affiliated agencies should retain only the essential institutions based on current actual needs. Those that are not currently essential or cannot be implemented at present should be abolished or merged (internal plans have been drafted for the reduction of provincial and county government institutions, which can be adopted). Each agency that handles temporary affairs does not need to set up a separate institution. The personnel required should be transferred as a principle; (2) State-owned enterprises without operating expenses or regular business should be abolished immediately; (3) The number of personnel established by each ministry, commission, provincial, municipal, and county government, and its affiliated agencies should be based on the complexity of the affairs handled, in order to determine the number of personnel to be established. If the original organization is large or the number of personnel exceeds the standard, efforts should be made to reduce or merge them separately; (4) The standards for the number of personnel to be established are as follows: A. General administrative agencies should take the receipt and dispatch of documents as the standard, and uniformly stipulate the number of documents (including incoming and outgoing documents) that each person should handle each month. The number of personnel should be determined after liquidating the total number of documents received and dispatched by the agency from January to the end of June of this year. B. Executive agencies should take the handling of affairs as the standard to determine the number of personnel. C. Research agencies should take the research matters as the standard to determine the number of personnel. D. Production agencies should take the personnel required by local private enterprises as the standard to determine the number of personnel. The detailed standards for each item in the preceding paragraph should be drafted separately by each ministry, commission, provincial, municipal, and county government under the Executive Yuan based on the nature of the agencies under their jurisdiction, and then uniformly stipulated after approval by the Executive Yuan (internal units of each agency should also adjust themselves automatically according to this standard, so as to avoid the drawbacks of uneven distribution of workload and unequal labor and leisure). State-owned enterprises should draft more flexible organizational regulations and complete the legislative procedures. The personnel should be sent to the Ministry of Personnel for qualification in accordance with the personnel regulations; (5) The total number of personnel handling affairs in each agency (documents, cashier, general affairs, accounting, and personnel of the agency) shall not exceed 30% of the personnel handling business; (6) The procedure for retaining existing personnel after each agency determines the number of personnel to be listed is as follows: A. Persons who have passed the examination according to law; B. Persons who are qualified for qualification; C. Professional personnel with special skills. If there is a surplus after the allocation of the number of places in the first three items, an examination should be held within the remaining quota, and the order of merit and reference service seniority should be used to retain them; (7) The handling of the determination of personnel reduction shall be in accordance with the following procedures: A. Assist in job transfer; B. Provide severance pay; C. If the government needs to establish new institutions due to factual needs, its personnel should be given priority to be appointed by the aforementioned dismissed personnel. Those who are assisted in job transfer and introduced to a job by a political affairs agency will not be given severance pay. If they seek their own livelihood or run a business, the original service agency may still be given severance pay if it provides assistance; (8) If each agency has special difficulties in reducing personnel according to these measures, it may apply to the Executive Yuan for drafting, and the sufficient personnel outside the standard personnel to be established should not be reduced temporarily. However, if the original personnel leave their positions (including voluntary resignation and dismissal due to reasons, etc.), they shall not be replaced again, in order to gradually reach the standard number of people. The number of excess personnel leaving their positions in the preceding paragraph shall be reported to the superior agency on a monthly basis and reported to the Executive Yuan for verification and budget reduction; (9) The expenses for layoffs shall be approved for payment from the expenses already included in the annual budget of each agency, and no additional expenses shall be added; (10) After each agency determines the number of personnel in accordance with the preceding articles, the expenses shall be based on the number of personnel, and shall be strictly controlled by the procedures of budget and final accounts. If there are any changes thereafter, the above standards shall be adjusted again when preparing the annual budget each year, and no additions shall be allowed at ordinary times; (11) Inspection matters shall be handled by the accounting agency and the auditing agency in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Areas - Election of Supervisory Committee Members - Organized by the Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissions</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The election of Supervisory Committee members by the participating councils of each province and city was previously decided by the Executive Yuan to be managed internally by the central government.

<h3>Measures for Allocating Quotas for Occupational Groups - Gu Zhenggang Explains Three Points - Those with Limited Total Quota Should be Allocated by Region or Elected Jointly Nationwide</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Minister Gu Zhenggang recently made the following remarks on the allocation of quota for occupational groups for elections: The detailed allocation measures for the election quota of occupational groups for National Assembly representatives and legislators should have been issued by the Ministry earlier. However, the originally allocated quota for industrial and commercial groups was too small. The groups successively appealed through documents and telegrams, and the National Government ordered the Legislative Yuan to review and discuss it. The Ministry also approved the letter from the National Government's Civil Affairs Office, transferring the President's instruction to directly consult with the Legislative Yuan. The matter has not yet been resolved. However, the National Assembly election procedure has been started for a long time. The detailed allocation measures cannot be delayed any further. The industrial and commercial groups' quota will not be allocated temporarily. The other detailed allocation measures will be formulated and announced separately after the quota for these groups is revised. The most important points to be explained are the following three points: (1) The quota for the number of members of various occupational groups to be elected in the two elections and the allocation of the number of women among them are determined by the Legislative Yuan in the original table. The Ministry can only consider and divide within the established quota. (2) The total quota for various occupational groups is limited. Except for the National Assembly's agricultural and labor groups, which can be subdivided by province and city, other parts can be divided into several regions nationwide, and another part of special industries can be allocated as much as possible according to the industry. The smallest number is determined to be elected jointly nationwide to avoid unevenness. (3) Except that there are more women among the employees of the Education Association, the quota for women can be allocated by region for National Assembly representatives. Other quotas will be calculated by comprehensive national votes to avoid vacancies in each county.</p>

<h3>Military and Political Supervisory Group of Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei - Begins Investigation of Denunciation Cases - Li Sicong Explains Determination to Rectify Military Discipline and Officialdom</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 26th] The Military and Political Supervisory Group of Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei hosted reporters at 5:00 p.m. on the 26th. The head of the group, Li Sicong, explained that the group has the determination to thoroughly rectify military discipline and officialdom without fear of powerful figures. He hoped that all military and political leaders would carefully consider President Chiang's love for the North and specially order the formation of this group to first rectify their subordinates. Since the group accepted denunciations, it has received more than 70 letters of denunciation. The members of the group have begun investigating them separately yesterday, and will soon go to inspect the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Beining railway lines and accept denunciations. Shi Zizhou, the Speaker of the Tianjin Temporary Council, will be stationed in Tianjin.</p>
<h3>After Suspension of Memorial Week - Changed to Weekly or Monthly Meetings</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After the Memorial Week is suspended, in order to communicate emotions, concentrate will, improve work efficiency, and advocate good habits in government agencies and schools, the Executive Yuan decided to change it to weekly or monthly meetings. The heads of agencies and schools will give spiritual speeches, or designate senior personnel to report on business, or give special lectures. The meeting procedures will be carried out in the manner of ordinary gatherings. The Executive Yuan passed these measures on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Application Cases</h3>
<p>Still Limited to Three Major Sectors</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the handling of foreign exchange application cases, they are currently divided into three major sectors: (1) Applications from government agencies are reviewed by the Executive Yuan Foreign Exchange Review Committee; (2) Applications from self-funded students studying abroad are handled by the Central Bank and reported to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for record; (3) Import and export foreign exchange cases are still handled by the Export and Import Management Committee. However, there are currently no clear regulations on where private individuals traveling abroad for sightseeing or recuperation and foreign exchange cases that are not import and export in nature (such as living expenses for reporters sent overseas by newspapers) should apply. The Foreign Exchange Review Committee believes that there are too many cases of this type, the procedures are cumbersome, and there are not enough personnel. Moreover, it is difficult for the government to fully implement the management of foreign exchange. After deliberation by the committee, it was decided that the foreign exchange cases under the jurisdiction of the committee should still be limited to the aforementioned three parts, and the Executive Yuan approved it at the meeting on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Vice President Sun in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Received Reporters Yesterday and Will Return to the Capital on the 30th</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] When Vice President Sun received reporters at the official residence of the Xing Yuan at 9:30 a.m. on the 26th, he replied to various inquiries: (1) The visit of Envoy Wei to China is to inspect how to help China. Other speculations are really overly concerned. At present, the threat to China is the Soviet Union, not the United States. The problem of Lushun and Dalian can prove it. The Vice President continued in a generous tone to point out those who are new imperialists. The current national crisis is actually more serious than the "September 18th" Incident. We should be especially vigilant. (2) The central government destroys peace, destroys transportation and industry, and makes people unable to live. It is really abandoned by the people of the country. To stop the civil strife, unless the Chinese Communist Party can change its mind and abandon the war, but he believes that the Communist rebellion can be quelled, unless we do not work hard. (3) The issue of recovering Hong Kong cannot be discussed at present. (4) The election will be held as scheduled, saying that there is no legal basis for postponement. (5) He himself has not yet considered running for legislator. It is also known that Vice President Sun is scheduled to return to the capital on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministry Sends Note to the United States - Protesting the Release of Pearson</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] According to reliable information: Our Foreign Ministry sent a note to the US Embassy in China on the 26th to convey to the US Department of State, protesting that US soldier Pearson, the perpetrator of the Dongdan incident in Peiping, was found not guilty by the US Department of Defense and was reinstated. It requested the US Department of State to forward to the Department of Defense to re-examine the matter based on the trial records, handle it impartially, and promptly fulfill the civil compensation part after the criminal part is determined.</p>
<h3>Third Batch of Assigned Japanese Warships - Can Arrive at Jiaozhou Bay Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 26th] The third batch of assigned Japanese warships, which is also the last batch, is being escorted to Qingdao by Major Zhong of our navy, escorted by the Japanese ship Ishi. The Second Base Command sent ships to sea to guide the port on the evening of the 26th, and it can sail into Jiaozhou Bay on the morning of the 27th. The largest of the batch of Japanese warships - the Zhong Yi Liang Yue destroyer - is 3,485 tons, followed by a 1,500-ton transport ship and six destroyers.</p>
<h3>Authoritative Sources in Washington Analyze Wei's Message, Hoping for Immediate Reforms and Assistance</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] A well-informed source (closely connected with Special Envoy Wei) stated on the 25th: "The publication of General Wedemeyer's farewell statement undoubtedly aims to compel the Chinese government to implement certain reforms, providing a basis for the United States to increase aid to the central government. The severe tone of the message does not indicate that Wei will recommend suspending aid to the central government after returning to Washington in mid-September." The source stated: The timing of Wei's statement indicates that it is intended to leverage official opinion and public sentiment in China to force the Chinese government to implement certain reforms when President Truman and General Marshall consider providing aid to China based on Wei's findings. Otherwise, this statement would have been released after Wei's return home. Wei stated: If the CCP is "truly patriotic," it should stop the war and assist the country through "peaceful means." The general opinion here is that the CCP will never do so, and therefore they cannot escape Wei's condemnation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wei's criticism of the National Government officials' incompetence and corruption may be mitigated by evidence of reform.</p>
<p>Observers generally believe that Wei has left the Chinese government a way out, allowing it to revitalize itself and qualify for American aid. However, the CCP clearly cannot accept Wei's suggestions.</p>
<p>Although Wei severely criticized various departments of the Chinese government, he made an exception for President Chiang Kai-shek, similar to Marshall's statement last spring.</p>
<p>This fact, coupled with Wei's statement that government reforms should be implemented immediately, leads diplomatic observers here to expect the Chinese government to announce a "reorganization" in the near future.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] The New York Times commented on General Wedemeyer's statement today: "General Wei's words are extremely clear and can be heard even in the most remote provinces of China. This statement is, in effect, a gentle 'ultimatum' to the National Government, stating that the National Government cannot obtain American aid until it has completed a rigorous and honest overhaul of itself."</p>
<h3>Minshe Party's Feng Jinbai to Visit Europe and America for Study</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 26th] Feng Jinbai, a key member of the Minshe Party, will travel to Europe and America in the short term to study the current political situations in various countries and research the factors contributing to their political enlightenment and social order. According to Feng, his motivation for this study stems from the current chaotic political situation in China, and he hopes to learn from his research. His study will focus particularly on the development of small European countries such as Switzerland, as the United States, with its advanced electrification, is not comparable. Feng's study will last for about a year, and he will travel in his personal capacity. He arrived in Nanjing from Guling on the 26th and will proceed to Shanghai after completing the departure procedures.</p>
<h3>Wei Arrives in Seoul from Japan, Issues Statement Clarifying Purpose of Trip, Report to be Drafted in Hawaii</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer left Haneda Airport here at 9:30 a.m. on the 26th for Korea. When asked about whether the Wedemeyer mission would visit the Soviet military zone in North Korea, a spokesman for Wedemeyer expressed doubt, but said it was not certain, as Wei had not yet been informed of any plans agreed upon by the US military in Korea.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Seoul, 26th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party arrived here at 2:25 p.m. on the 26th and immediately issued a statement stating that the fact-finding mission is scheduled for one week and will not hold press conferences. The mission personnel will work completely objectively and without prejudice. All reports obtained will be submitted to the US government, which will then decide how to assist the Korean people, improve their welfare, and safeguard their hard-won peace.</p>
<p>[United News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Well-informed sources said: After visiting Korea, Special Envoy Wedemeyer will fly to Japan and then to Hawaii, where he can "concentrate on drafting the report without external influence" and submit it to President Truman. There are two reasons for Wei's choice of Hawaii to prepare the report: the climate in Hawaii is mild, completely different from the humid heat of Nanjing, and its location is ideal for a good working environment.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Reports on Wei's Departure Statement at the Political Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 26th] At the Political Affairs Meeting on the 26th, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on General Wedemeyer's visit to China, stating briefly: The Chinese side provided as much assistance as possible to Special Envoy Wei during his month-long stay in China to facilitate his work. His farewell statement was indeed very frank and straightforward, and his starting point was genuine friendship. Unfortunately, his stay in China was too short, and the situation in China and the Far East has changed greatly in the past six months. It seems that Wei still needs to further understand some issues. Subsequently, various political committee members spoke, with some believing that Wei's criticism of some government officials for corruption and incompetence was too general and vague. Some believed that China's difficulties were no longer purely internal affairs. The conclusion in Wei's statement that everything should be resolved by China on its own seemed unfair. Some believed that, judging from Wei's statement, some of his judgments were no different from those made by previous senior American officials who visited China, which may be due to the influence of certain preconceived notions. Some believed that Wei's continued expectation that the communists would abandon armed struggle and consider the interests of the people was a naive argument. However, all unanimously acknowledged Wei as a sincere friend of China and looked forward to working together. After a heated discussion, all political committee members expressed their willingness to work hard, be diligent and strive for progress, and overcome the difficulties together.</p>

<h3>National Army in Southern Henan Inflicts Heavy Losses on Remnant Bandits, Liu Bocheng's 6th Column Destroyed, Bandit Activities in Western Henan Blocked at Luoyang</h3>

The defending troops bravely counterattacked, and after fierce fighting until the morning of the 25th, the bandits were defeated and fled south in a panic. The National Army continued to cross the Ru River and pursue them, annihilating more than 5,000 bandits and seizing more than 70 vehicles, 400 horses, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 100 rifles. On the afternoon of the 25th, the National Army patrolled as far as Baoxinji, north of Xixian County. Also, Liu's 6th Column attacked Gushi on the 24th.

<p>[Central News Agency Zhengzhou, 26th] The entire 6th Column of the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops has been wiped out in the Runanpu area. Although other columns still have localized fleeing actions, they have also formed an unorganized state of collapse. Most personnel have changed into civilian clothes, abandoning or selling their weapons, and are preparing to go into hiding. Many are preparing to surrender to the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 26th] The National Army has recently crossed the highway running between Liu'an and Guangshan on the border of Henan and Anhui, intercepting the 6th Column of Liu Bocheng's communist bandits, who had secretly crossed the Huai River from Sanhejian and could advance into Gushi. This is the beginning of the contact between the southern National Army and the fleeing Liu bandits. The National Army has approached Gushi on the 26th and is launching a strong offensive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Luoyang, 26th] The total number of bandits who crossed the river from Xin'an and Shanzhou in western Henan is more than 40,000.

<p>[This newspaper Taiyuan, 26th] The National Army in Linfen captured Shicun, an important town on the Tongpu Railway, on the 20th. There is also talk of the recovery of Fencheng County.</p>
<p>A Major Battle in Jiaodong is About to Begin, National Army Approaches Laizhou Bay</p>
<p>[This newspaper Yanzhou, 26th] A major decisive battle that will truly determine the overall situation in Shandong, and the last battle on the Shandong battlefield, is rapidly brewing in Jiaodong. Regarding the scale of this battle, a qualified military observer told this reporter in an optimistic tone: The plains of the northern Shandong battlefield are impossible for the communist bandits to defend for long. Therefore, the Jiaodong battle should be the final showdown on the Shandong battlefield. After the Shandong battles are over, most of the battles within the customs will be resolved, and the Jinpu and Pinghan railways can be completely opened in the shortest possible time. To this end, future war developments will clearly focus on Shanxi as the military center for suppressing bandits.</p>
<p>[This newspaper Qingdao, 26th] The National Army in Changyi advanced north in the autumn rain yesterday and today, and has approached Hutouya (25 li northwest of Pixian) on the east coast of Laizhou Bay, which is also one of the bandits' ports. It is widely believed that the National Army is deploying a large-scale offensive, hoping to completely clear the entire Shandong Peninsula in one fell swoop. In fact, the navy has been constantly patrolling the Bohai Sea, and its duties are similar to blockading various ports.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The highway between Jinan and Weixian is clear, and passenger and freight transport can be restored tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The passenger fare is 80,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[This newspaper Jinan, 26th] The Wenhe River Bridge on the Yanji section of the highway has been completed, and the road officially resumed traffic on the 26th. A delegation from the Jinan press to Zibo found the highway between Jinan and Zibo too muddy to travel and had to turn back before reaching Wangsherenzhuang.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 26th] The National Army north of the Jiaoji Railway recovered Qidong before dawn on the 25th. All counties on both sides of the Xiaoqing River have since been brought under the control of the National Army.

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Recovers Ganyu City, Wang Maogong Talks About Intensifying Zonal Encirclement and Suppression Work</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Xinpu, 26th] Ganyu County and Qingkou Town, which had been occupied by communist bandits again, were successively recovered by the National Army on the 26th.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently stated: The Provincial Government's greatest efforts over the past two years have been to eliminate the bandit army in northern Jiangsu and maintain local security, but frequent large-scale troop movements have prevented the pacification work from being completed. The communist bandits in northern Jiangsu are elusive and difficult to eliminate, and the coastal areas are constantly receiving supplies. After the military situation in northern Jiangsu became tense, it was decided to strengthen zonal encirclement and suppression to achieve complete success. In addition, the military situation in the three neighboring provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui is closely related to northern Jiangsu. This time, Liu Bocheng's remnants lost all their heavy weapons and supplies in Shandong and fled to southern Henan. The National Army is making every effort to pursue and annihilate them. Otherwise, if a bandit base is established in the Dabie Mountains, there will be no peace in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[This newspaper Nantong, 26th] Since the National Army recovered Yancheng, order has been restored, and the county magistrate, Liu Xianpei, will return to his post in Shanxi Province to report.

According to the US military authorities here, Aduorui will still be transferred to Beijing to testify during the trial of another suspect, Sergeant Savani. The rumor that he will be sent to the United States to serve his sentence is slightly different from the facts. His transfer to Shanghai is only for the convenience of detention.

<h3>First Letter Behind the "Iron Curtain": Entering the Red Polish Capital to Mourn the Ruins of Warsaw</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>The Vistula River meanders northward, from the Carpathian Mountains all the way to the Baltic Sea, quietly, its dull gray waters creating the Polish Great Plain, and also creating the beautiful city of Warsaw. According to the Poles themselves: their ancestors lived here for generations, this is their original "old home." Formal Polish historical records begin around the year 1000 AD. For more than 900 years, the history of Poland has been woven with blood and tears. Even today, when Poles talk about "the general trend of the world," they feel a hidden pain in their hearts.</p>
<p>I entered Warsaw from Berlin on a British Air Force plane. Beforehand, I certainly felt an unusual anxiety. To be honest, it wasn't because Warsaw was behind the "Iron Curtain" that I worried about any danger to my life, but rather because I knew so little about the situation in Poland. In my country, there were very few books in bookstores specifically about Poland (it seems that Independent Publishing House had a "History of the Restoration of Poland"), and even fewer commentaries or introductions to the modern situation in Poland. In 1939, when Hitler marched into Warsaw, Poland was divided under the champagne glasses of Molotov and Ribbentrop. A newspaper in China wrote a rather "shocking" commentary adding insult to injury. I plan to mention this case in detail in my next dispatch, but in any case, Poland's situation is tragic, and in the eyes of the Chinese people, Poland is not as "hateful" as that commentary's author saw it.</p>
<p>Poland Can Be Compared to Korea</p>
<p>The impressions of the few days I stayed in Warsaw reminded me of a novel by a young Chinese writer, "Sketches of Arctic Scenery," which tells the "sad history" of a Korean youth and a Polish girl. Comparing Poland in the West to Korea in the Far East, I believe this author has a unique inspiration. Three days before leaving Berlin, I met Miss Cowan, a female reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, at the press club. She was also preparing to fly to Warsaw at that time. We chatted about some irrelevant things. Finally, she said very seriously: "It's good to go and see, see a nation that is always conquered by others, their latent inner sorrow!"</p>
<p>She took an American plane and entered Warsaw a day before me. Because I was in a hurry and my miscellaneous affairs in Berlin were not finished, I temporarily asked the Royal Air Force to help me. The Royal Air Force has two special flights a week from London to Poland, passing through Berlin (the American plane has one passenger plane a week). With the special efforts of Major Jones, my name was temporarily inserted. Early in the morning, just as dawn broke, Mr. Xu Xichong, a Chinese resident in Berlin, and Mr. Liu Jingwei, a Chinese leader from Vienna, drove their own car to the "Gatow" airfield to send me off. In a short journey of two hours and five minutes, I flew over the heavily guarded "Iron Curtain" and entered the red Polish capital, Warsaw.</p>
<p>Language Barrier, the Power of English "Dies"</p>
<p>The first difficulty encountered upon arriving in Warsaw was the "language barrier." A Polish Foreign Ministry official on the same trip had just returned from London. Many people at the airport were welcoming him, and they were all saying "Dzień dobry" (Good morning). Dealing with many people who were helping him carry his luggage, they were all saying "Do widzenia" (Goodbye). The Royal Air Force dropped me off at the Warsaw airfield, and their responsibility was considered complete. In order to find a "streetcar" to get into the city, I was sweating profusely because of the language barrier. In the end, the Foreign Ministry official helped and I "bummed" a ride on his luggage cart.</p>
<p>Sitting side by side in the luggage cart was a Foreign Ministry orderly. He offered me a Polish cigarette. No matter how I tried to gesture, he could not understand a single word of my English. The "Iron Curtain" of Europe is not only a division in politics and diplomacy, but also a division in "language." Once you step behind the Iron Curtain, the power of English comes to an end. In the luggage cart, I looked up at the sky, and I felt an indescribable fear in my heart, fearing that my mission to Poland would completely fail.</p>
<p>The airfield is located in the southwest corner of Warsaw. The field is filled with more than twenty passenger and transport planes of "Polish National Airlines", all with brand-new silver background and black letter markings. There are many American and British tourists at the station, and there are many advertisements for Swedish Airlines and Czech Airlines, attracting tourists to visit Stockholm and Prague. I noticed that there were no advertisements on the wall attracting tourists to visit Moscow. Presumably, the Russians don't like that kind of thing!</p>
<p>Heart-Stirring, Not a Single Complete House</p>
<p>The shocking impression Warsaw gave me was: rubble everywhere, the traces of war completely present. In 1945, I traveled in post-war Europe. I saw the ruins of Berlin and the devastation of Hamburg, which left me with an indelible impression. This time I came to Poland, two years later, and I still felt that the tragic situation in Warsaw was shocking. The Poles themselves say: There is not a single 100% complete house in the city of Warsaw. Like a pockmarked face, there are bullet holes everywhere, half of the houses are bombed, there are steel-concrete "dangerous walls," and even in the so-called "Jewish quarter," where the artillery fire was the fiercest, there is a wasteland where even the outlines of the dangerous walls cannot be found. I often like to ask the Warsaw people who can speak English: "In your opinion, how many years will it take for Warsaw to return to its pre-war glory?" They always shrug their shoulders and stretch out their hands: "Ten years, twenty years, maybe thirty years!"</p>
<p>No Pole does not rave about their pre-war Warsaw: asphalt roads with green shade on both sides, orderly rectangular buildings, red roofs, from the small windows of the roofs, you can see the bell towers of the churches, you can see the dark blue water of the Vistula River (Note: The Poles themselves call it the Wisła River). In summer, the water is shallow, and sand beaches rise on the Vistula River. Many young men and women swim in the shallow water of the Vistula River. They sing, exercise, and even get drunk.</p>
<p>Nazi Destruction by Any Means, Destroying Little Paris</p>
<p>In 1939, they will never forget that tragic year. The gunfire broke up their peaceful lives, young people wandered far away, and the elderly groaned under the iron hooves, barely surviving for five years. But at that time, Warsaw was still intact, with less than 20% destroyed.</p>
<p>The disaster in Warsaw occurred in 1944. In early summer, the Russian army liberated Lublin and rushed to the suburbs of Warsaw like a broken bamboo. At that time, the Polish National Committee in Moscow reorganized into the Polish government of Lublin. The orthodox Polish government, which had originally been in exile in London, in order to cooperate with the combat forces, mobilized all the Warsaw underground workers and launched an anti-Nazi "revolutionary movement." The revolution in the city was originally expected to cooperate with the offensive of the Russian army. However, there was no understanding between London and Moscow in advance. When the "Capital Revolution" led by the London exiled government broke out, the Russian army and the Polish army under the leadership of Russia stood still, and even retreated several hundred meters. This aroused the deep hatred of the German army. Those Nazi lads set fires, poured oil, and planted landmines, destroying the city of Warsaw by any means. August and September 1944 were the dark days that Warsaw will never be able to erase. The distant artillery fire of the Russian soldiers, the street fighting between the underground forces and the Nazi army, destroyed Warsaw and destroyed this beautiful city once known as "Little Paris".</p>
<p>City Appearance One-Third Like Chongqing</p>
<p>The Russian army formally entered the city of Warsaw in February 1945. Many overseas Chinese also saw: during the period when the underground forces were fighting alone, British planes dropped supplies over Warsaw. Intermittent street fighting lasted for more than a month. Magnificent buildings were penetrated by artillery shells, and the majestic bridges over the Vistula River were all blown up.</p>
<p>Now, one of the four bridges has been repaired. Wandering on the bridge makes me think of the bridge in Prague, Czech Republic. The cities of Eastern Europe have something in common with each other, and they all have a unique feature that makes people think deeply. Now, times have changed, Eastern Europe is covered with "curtains," and the boudoir is deeply locked. Of course, there are many different feelings!</p>
<p>Another image Warsaw gave me is that it is one-third like Chongqing. Broken walls and ruins are everywhere. However, many simple houses without chess pieces have been leisurely built on both sides of the road, which reminds me of the Chongqing commercial area and Shangqingsi. Small square wooden houses in streets and alleys are everywhere in Warsaw. They are cigarette stands and newsstands. The high-altitude slogans that cross the road, the soldiers in grassy green and dirty uniforms in groups of three or five on the road, are all like Chongqing during the most difficult period of the war. In particular, the long-distance buses in the suburbs of Warsaw, without tops and canopies, and trucks with wooden railings nailed around them, require passengers to get a number first, and wait for the roll call to get on the "one-stop" bus, which is exactly the same as the scenery of Qixinggang in Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Degree of Housing Shortage is the World's Worst, Regulations Require Two People to Live in One Room</p>
<p>The difficulty of transportation is not the only problem. The most problematic thing in Warsaw is housing. "Housing shortage" is a problem everywhere in the world, but I am afraid that none is as severe as in Warsaw. The war destroyed more than half of the houses in Warsaw, but the population of the city has not decreased. The Warsaw Capital Police Department stipulates that two people must share a room, and in large households with "nine out of ten rooms empty," the police department forces them to rent out the remaining rooms. It is extremely difficult to find a hotel temporarily in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Warsaw has three hotels that "deal with foreign affairs": Polonia, Bristol, and Central. Before the war, Bristol was the largest in scale, but unfortunately it was destroyed by artillery fire and is now being repaired "on a large scale". Polonia is the most complete. The American ambassador, many diplomatic envoys, and even foreign reporters all live in Polonia. Because the Royal Air Force could not determine the date, I did not telegraph in advance and went to Polonia to ask for a room temporarily. The "shopkeeper" looked at me very awkwardly. I later learned that to stay at the Polonia Hotel, you must have a notice from the Polish Foreign Ministry before you are allowed to move in. The embassy called the Foreign Ministry for me, and the Polish Foreign Ministry gave a wonderful answer: "Was this reporter invited by the Polish government, or did he request to come? If he was invited, he can live in Polonia!" Of course, I was sensible and looked for other ways. Finally, with the help of Mr. Bao Jinpu, the chargé d'affaires of the embassy, and Secretary Li Zhaorui, I moved into the Bristol Hotel, which was being "built on a large scale" and was half-finished.</p>
<p>In this way, I finally came to Warsaw, and with my first footstep, I stepped into the inner layer of the "Iron Curtain"! (Warsaw, July 19)</p>
<p>(Note: "Dzień dobry" in Polish means "Good morning"; "Do widzenia" or read as "琴貴" in Polish means "Thank you.)</p>
<p>Poland is Reborn Amidst the Ruins (Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Teachers' Day</h3>
<p>Today is the birthday of our nation's teacher, Confucius. Setting this day as Teachers' Day has a special meaning. The municipal authorities and various legal entities have set this day to hold celebrations and publicity to arouse the public's "respect for teachers and valuing the Tao", which is really worthy of our common praise. I would like to extend my heartfelt respect to the hard-working teachers all over the country.</p>
<p>Our country has traditionally respected teachers. Even in the villages today, we can still see every household posting red paper with black characters saying "Heaven, Earth, Country, Parents, Teacher" in the middle hall, burning incense and bowing every day. Among all kinds of occupations, why should we especially respect teachers? This is worth considering. We must know that the characteristic of the teaching profession is "sacrifice oneself for others", to "learn without being tired and teach without being weary". He is the nanny of the nation, the mentor of society, the leader of academic thought, and the model of the crowd. He undertakes the most basic work of nation-building.</p>
<p>Society is like a pyramid. At the top of the tower are great politicians, great military strategists, great scientists, great artists... receiving the respect, praise, and worship of society. But teachers, especially primary and secondary school teachers, are like the cornerstone placed at the lowest level of this great tower, bearing the greatest pressure. They have no fame, no fortune, no power; all they have is a passion to inspire students' innate wisdom and good character every day, and to fight against the depravity, stupidity, and bad habits of children and young people. This year, a middle school math teacher explains "linear equations," and next year it is still "linear equations." Although the teaching methods change, the content is still roughly the same. Year after year, the students become famous, but he is still explaining "linear equations". He stands at his post and works hard all year round, taking the students' achievements as his own achievements and the students' happiness as his own happiness. He himself has "light" and "heat", but this "light" and "heat" are often not understood by the general public. As a result, he seems to light up many candles, and he himself bears the reflection of these candles and gets glory and happiness. Teachers build hope and happiness on their students, and they just bury themselves in hard work, regardless of fame and fortune, and do not seek power, especially in today's Chinese society, especially in the countryside, drinking thin porridge to live. Therefore, the ideal teacher is a "sage", a "perfect man", an "unsung hero". Is such a teacher not worthy of our worship and respect?</p>
<p>The reasons why teachers deserve our respect are as mentioned above. But unfortunately, the spirit of traditional respect for teachers in China today has been lost. Part of the teachers themselves also seem to have changed their nature. When we think of words like "respect for teachers and valuing the Tao" or "strict teachers and respected Tao", and look at the current situation, we cannot help but worry all day long.</p>
<p>In today's society, money is often used to represent a person's status and success. The conditions of material life, of course, follow wealth. Teachers' lives are difficult, and they are inevitably seen as "poor and sour" by some people. The general morality of society has declined, and poverty is looked down upon, so how can there be "respect"? Even if someone talks about "respecting teachers", most of it is superficial and verbal. What is there about teachers that is worthy of the respect of the general public? No wonder junior high school graduates all enter high school and are unwilling to enter normal school. The number of high school graduates who volunteer to enter normal colleges is always less than that of universities, unless they want to get "public funding" before entering normal school. This is a fact that is obvious to all in the education circle. In many gatherings, we hear other friends advise teachers to change careers, saying that being a teacher is a lifetime without success. These conversations are often discovered among very close friends. The original intention is not malicious. Looking at the current situation, if this continues to evolve, those with a little ability will not want to be teachers. Even if they are teachers, it is only temporary, treating the school as a hotel and a place for the unemployed to live. Therefore, students' grades are declining day by day. Thinking of this, I cannot help but worry about our second generation and cry for the future of our nation! We sincerely hope that the authorities will quickly improve teachers' salaries, solve teachers' lives, and hope that people in society will recognize teachers' contributions to the country and the nation and change their contemptuous attitude. We must know that one more effort from teachers will cultivate one more unit of vitality for the country. Quickly look further ahead and be vigilant!</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about the teachers themselves. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, they were displaced and in dire straits. After the war, they were still suffering, but most of the teachers still stood at their posts and worked hard. Although sometimes they felt that "it is better to die early than to suffer," they were able to recognize their responsibilities and strive hard with perseverance, which is enough to be a "teacher's role model" without shame. Teachers' life ideals are not understood by ordinary people; teachers' life values are not estimated by ordinary worldly people. This spirit of "hard work and self-sacrifice" is what our national spirit is entrusted to. Teachers themselves should have this ambition and this confidence. On the other hand, if teachers lose this ambition and confidence, and lose taking "students' progress" and "changing social customs" as the center of their life's happiness, then the work of teaching will naturally be tasteless. What is even more sad is that in today's society, there are sometimes those who run schools in name but are actually doing business, and there are also those who teach in name but are actually cheating for food, harming children and misleading all living beings. How can a person who does not cultivate virtue, does not speak of conduct, and is not proficient in learning lead children and young people and be a model for society? How can he arouse the respect of people in society? Although these are a minority, we hope that we can correct these mistakes on this solemn Teachers' Day. To make people in society "respect teachers and value the Tao", teachers must first be able to respect themselves!</p>
<p>In short, the essence of the teaching profession is noble, so it is worthy of our admiration, and its festival is even more worthy of our celebration. We want to call on people in society to recognize the essence of teachers' work, solve teachers' lives, and promote respect for teachers, but teachers themselves must also fully express their original learning and conduct that can make people spontaneously admire them. In this way, Teachers' Day can be more meaningful and valuable.</p>

<h3>Security Council Continues to Discuss the India-Netherlands Issue; Decides to Establish an Arbitration Committee; Consuls in Batavia Will Provide Reports; France Exercises Veto Power, Soviet Proposal Overturned</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, 26th: The Security Council's proposal to mediate the India-Netherlands dispute has been formally accepted by Indonesia today. At the same time, Indonesia has also accepted the proposal for six consuls-general to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire order. The attitudes of the Netherlands are now attracting attention from all parties, but it is expected that the Netherlands will reject the Security Council's "mediation" efforts. Indonesia also agrees that the Netherlands and Indonesia should each select a member state of the Security Council, and the two member states should jointly select a third member state to form a three-nation committee to mediate the Netherlands-Indonesia dispute.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] The Security Council reconvened today, attempting to resolve the Indonesian case. First on the agenda was a proposal by the Belgian representative to ask the International Court of Justice to rule on whether the Security Council has the power to take action on this case. The Polish representative also put forward a resolution urging the Netherlands and Indonesia to abide by the ceasefire order. Soviet Representative Gromyko vehemently attacked the Belgian proposal. Some observers believe that Gromyko may again exercise his veto power.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 25th] France today used its veto power for the first time in the Security Council to overturn a Soviet proposal to establish a committee by the Security Council to supervise the ceasefire order in Indonesia. It was the first time that a permanent member of the Security Council other than the Soviet Union had used its veto power. The Soviet proposal was voted on, with seven votes in favor, two against (Belgium and France), and two abstentions (China and the United Kingdom). Another joint resolution put forward by China and Australia to order the current consuls stationed in Batavia to supervise the ceasefire order was passed with seven votes in favor, none against, and four abstentions (the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Colombia). Prior to that, Soviet Representative Gromyko criticized the US proposal to establish an arbitration committee to assist in resolving the India-Netherlands dispute. The proposal advocated the appointment of representatives from three countries to form an arbitration committee, with two countries each designated by the parties to the dispute, and the third country designated by the two designated countries. Gromyko said that this was a typical example of attempting to circumvent the United Nations mechanism. US Representative Johnson refuted it and said that he did not believe that any member of the Security Council would seriously doubt the motives of the United States. After voting, the US proposal was passed with eight votes to zero, and the Soviet Union and three other countries abstained. During the debate today, Indonesian Representative Salim also spoke, asking the Security Council to recognize the Netherlands' launch of an act of aggression against Indonesia and order the Dutch army to withdraw from the territory of Indonesia. Salim expressed great doubt about the proposal to order the consuls in Batavia to investigate the situation in Indonesia, saying that these consuls mostly observed the situation through the eyes of the Dutch.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 26th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie told reporters today that the Security Council's passage of the US resolution to send a three-member commission to assist in resolving the Indonesian dispute did not make the disputing parties feel enthusiastic satisfaction. Indonesian Representative Salim admitted that the Security Council's decision to place Indonesia and the Netherlands on an equal footing when appointing representatives to the three-member commission was a victory for Indonesia, but said that Indonesia still believed that the Security Council should handle the entire incident.</p>

<h3>Inauguration of the Canberra Conference: Representatives from the US, Australia, and Canada Deliver Speeches Emphasizing the Early Conclusion of a Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] The conference of the British Commonwealth discussing the peace treaty with Japan was inaugurated at 11:00 AM this morning in the Australian Federal House of Representatives. All members of the Commonwealth, except Burma, are participating. Australian Prime Minister Chifley, as the host, welcomed the representatives on behalf of the Australian government and people. He stated that it was the first time such a conference had been held in a British dominion, which was of particular significance not only for Australia but for every constituent part of the Commonwealth. He expressed regret at Burma's failure to attend the opening ceremony and hoped that its representative would arrive in time to participate in subsequent meetings.</p>
<p>The conference immediately elected Chifley as chairman, followed by an opening address by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. He expressed his regret that the world was still in a state that was neither peace nor war. He urged the representatives to reflect on the tragic phenomenon of today's world, as the old world had died and the new world had not yet been born, which should not be ignored. In discussing the peace treaty with Japan, Evatt declared, "We should strive to achieve justice and democracy for Japan. The British Commonwealth welcomes the active role of the United States in the Pacific region. We hope that, under the leadership of the United States, peace will finally come to this part of the world." British Chief Representative and Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations Addison then spoke, expressing his pleasure at the presence of representatives from India and Pakistan and hoping that this pleasant state of harmony would last forever. He reiterated that Britain did not want Japan to receive a harsh peace, but only a peace based on justice and democracy. However, he strongly emphasized that Japan's imperial territories must be stripped away to prevent the cultivation of institutions of aggression, as there was still doubt as to how far Japan had progressed on the road to peace. Addison continued, saying that Britain had agreed early in the war that the United States must bear the moral responsibility for peace in the Pacific and Asian regions, but this agreement did not mean that Britain would transfer its legitimate interests in the Pacific region to the United States. He urged the representatives not to forget that Japan was part of the Pacific and that Japan's rightful place within this circle should not be denied. Canadian Representative Claxton declared that peace and prosperity could not be established anywhere as long as one part of the world remained at peace while another remained at war. Therefore, the main condition for prosperity was comprehensive peace, and he hoped that all representatives would work to achieve this condition. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser stated that this conference did not represent the British Commonwealth forming a faction against the United States. He said that the United States' leadership in the Pacific was a recognized fact, and the British Commonwealth did not intend to dispute this point and would further strengthen its position. He also echoed Addison's call for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: Tsaldaris, who had spent three days attempting to form a new Greek government, officially announced today the failure of negotiations with the Liberal Party. Before the announcement, Tsaldaris had consulted with U.S. Ambassador MacVeagh for ninety minutes. According to Tsaldaris, he had proposed that a neutral politician be appointed as prime minister, but Liberal Party leader Sophoulis insisted that he himself should be appointed as prime minister and that the ministers of the army, justice, and public order should all be members of the Liberal Party, thus breaking off negotiations.

<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister's Reply Does Not Help the Overall Situation: U.S. Officials Express Deep Dissatisfaction; The Korean Situation May Be Submitted to the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources say, "Some officials" are increasingly emotional about the Korean issue, which the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been unable to resolve for over a year, and the claims of the United Nations. It is also said that U.S. officials are "extremely disappointed" with Molotov's note on Korea and are discussing adopting a thorough plan to resolve the Korean issue so that its provisional government can unify the entire country. Well-informed sources say that a very important action is "quite possible" to be announced next weekend.</p>
<p>Molotov's reply agreed with Marshall's proposal that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission should report the discussion to Moscow and Washington, but officials here believe that Molotov's reply does not help the situation at all. Moreover, the British did not reply even after the deadline (August 21st) for the committee designated by Marshall to report had passed. Molotov's observation of the current state of the committee makes these officials believe that it is hopeless to resolve the issue according to the Moscow Agreement of December 1945, and that even direct negotiations between Moscow and Washington will not be effective. Therefore, the United States' ability to resolve this issue is greatly limited. One aspect says that the United States can only return this issue to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the Moscow Agreement, or submit it to the United Nations, or directly implement a plan for economic and political development in South Korea.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Have Reached an Understanding on the Exemption of Discriminatory Restrictions on Purchasing Goods; Eady Returns Home to Report on Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The British Cabinet ended its second emergency cabinet meeting in two weeks tonight. No official communique was issued after the meeting to explain what response the United States had to Britain's request to suspend the application of the non-discrimination clause in the loan agreement. Most observers believe that the United States has agreed not to regard Britain's failure to comply with this clause as a violation of the agreement.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is understood that the cabinet has also reached a resolution on some austerity measures, but these measures still need to be announced publicly by Prime Minister Attlee himself. It was previously heard that Sir Eady, the head of the British financial delegation who had just returned to London from Washington, went to 10 Downing Street, but he did not enter the cabinet meeting room, but went to the neighboring Treasury office. Upon arriving at the airport, Eady gave only slight hints about the extremely confidential resolutions reached in Washington. He said: "My purpose in going to the United States has been achieved. The discussion on the non-discrimination clause was very valuable. The problems facing Britain have been dealt with in the best possible good faith and understanding." After the cabinet has thoroughly reviewed the results of the Washington negotiations, it can decide whether it is necessary to purchase from countries other than the United States at will without being based on the proportion of purchases from the United States. According to the non-discrimination clause, Britain's purchases of food and raw materials from other countries must be reduced in proportion to the degree of reduction in imports from the United States.</p>
<p>Remaining Loans to Be Frozen</p>
<p>Today, most of Britain's loans from the United States have been used up, and the remainder has been frozen. Therefore, Britain's imports must be reduced to be equal to the exports earned. Washington revealed today that Britain will withdraw another 150 million U.S. dollars from the U.S. loan today, and another 150 million U.S. dollars can be withdrawn on Friday. The remaining 400 million U.S. dollars will be frozen indefinitely.</p>

<h3>President Zhang Furious: Supervisors Should Be Jointly Responsible for Tax Officials' Embezzlement; Lei Zhen Reports on Investigation in Shanghai at Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 26th, Lei Zhen gave an impromptu report on the investigation of the Shanghai tax officials' corruption case, saying that according to the reports of Zhang Zhongyuan and others, tax officials did extort money from the Seven Furniture Stores, with so-called negotiation fees and other items in addition to the regular taxes, of which six were one-on-one, while the business established by Zhang Zhongyuan was less. The negotiations over dinner at Guanshengyuan were also confirmed. After the corrupt officials heard that the incident had occurred, they hurriedly returned the checks paid by the six stores. After Lei Zhen finished reporting, Yu Hongjun said that there were many personnel in the Ministry of Finance, and it was inevitable that there would be bad apples. If there was solid evidence, they would be severely punished. President Zhang was also very angry when he heard about this corruption, and said that the supervisors should also be jointly responsible. It is heard that after Lei returned to Beijing, in addition to reporting the investigation process at the Executive Yuan meeting, he also provided the investigation findings to the Ministry of Finance for reference. In addition, Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department, met with Lei Zhen on the 26th for a long conversation.</p>
<h3>Affected Furniture Merchants Claim Signing Statements Was Due to Enticement and Coercion</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the case of embezzlement by tax auditors of the Direct Taxation Bureau, Director Lou Guowei stated the day before yesterday that when the bureau conducted its own investigation, six of the seven furniture stores involved had signed statements proving that there was no extortion or embezzlement. It is now learned that the aforementioned six Chinese furniture stores yesterday entrusted lawyer Ma Junshuo to send a letter to Director Lou, solemnly stating that the previous signed statements were due to enticement and coercion and were not legally binding. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, according to our clients, Zhu Jianni, of Zhu Genji Store, Cao Caigeng, of Wufu Store, Zhang Xianliang, of Senmao Store, Zhang Shouqi, of Wantai Store, and Yang Longquan, of Yang Longxing Store, our stores operate Chinese furniture in accordance with the law and pay taxes. Unexpectedly, Yu, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Gao, Xie, Wang, and Yang, and other ten auditors from the Direct Taxation Bureau of this city, threatened and illegally demanded money from our stores on various pretexts. The matter was reported by Director Zhang Zhongyuan of the same industry association to Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, and reported to the Ministry of Finance, and it was decided to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the case. Unexpectedly, after the bureau's staff read the news in the newspapers, they became fearful and hurriedly used lightning-fast means to come to our stores on the 23rd of this month and enticed and coerced us to sign statements proving that the bureau's staff had not demanded bribes in the past. Our stores, because Speaker Pan and Director Zhang had not yet returned to Shanghai at that time, were deeply afraid of being retaliated against, so we had to tolerate it temporarily. However, the fact that the bureau's staff demanded bribes in the past is clear and cannot be denied. Now that Speaker Pan has truthfully reported the matter to the central government, the bureau should strictly deal with the relevant staff in accordance with the facts, and it is impossible to erase everything with a piece of paper that tries to cover up the truth. Moreover, an untrue expression of intent is not legally binding and has no effect on our legal accusations. The above points should be communicated to the Director of the Direct Taxation Bureau of this city by your lawyer for solemn clarification, and we request that you conduct a strict investigation and deal with the matter to rectify official discipline and protect merchants. We hope that you will investigate and deal with the matter accordingly and reply to us as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Airlines Planning to Raise Prices: Increased Gasoline Prices Greatly Affect Passenger and Freight Costs</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The oil, machinery, and part of the salaries of foreign employees used by China and Central Airlines are paid in foreign exchange, accounting for more than 70% of the expenditure. Before the announcement of the new foreign exchange measures, the two companies had prepared detailed charts and figures and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for transfer to the Executive Yuan for approval of official preferential foreign exchange, but no approval has been received so far. Now, the gasoline companies in this city raised the price of aviation gasoline by 100% in early July. On the 25th of this month, they notified the two companies that the price of gasoline must be paid at the market price of the U.S. dollar in the future. The two airlines stated yesterday that, if necessary, they may have to adjust passenger and freight prices in proportion to gasoline prices, but this must be based on whether they can obtain official-priced foreign exchange. Now that the Executive Yuan has refused to approve it, the companies will have to settle foreign exchange with the Equalization Fund at market prices, and the cost will increase by four or five times, and the air freight will also increase by four or five times accordingly.</p>

<h3>Supervision Envoy's Office Suspects Seven Points in the Thorough Investigation of UNRRA Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the case of six senior officials of UNRRA being accused of corruption, the Supervision Envoy's Office has been actively investigating and collecting relevant information from various sources for several days. Yesterday, Chen Jianye, the section chief in charge of the case, told reporters that the investigation work had come to an end so far, and they were now starting to sort out the various materials obtained, including UNRRA's distribution of electric fans, wheat, and cotton in exchange for yarn, as well as the various documents of the "UNRRA Staff Association" that raised thirteen points of suspicion. Therefore, the sorting work is very heavy. However, this case is of great importance and has attracted the attention of all sectors of society.

If there are no other new discoveries, the sorting work can also be completed in a short period of time, and something may be announced at that time.</p>
<h3>Material Sold by Ticket System Distinguished by Open and Secret Procedures; No Appointment Order for the Director of the Resettlement Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>East China News Agency: In the UNRRA embezzlement case, the Supervision Envoy's Office has been sending personnel to thoroughly investigate for several days and has discovered the following points where the office is suspected of embezzlement: (1) When UNRRA distributed electric fans, why did the applicants directly contact the manager of the purchasing and sales office instead of going through the receiving and dispatching office, and there were no records to check for the distribution of fans from beginning to end? (2) Why were more than 400,000 tons of wheat sold by UNRRA without public bidding, and the method of selling was ambiguous and unclear? (3) There are two types of bids for UNRRA's relief materials: open bids and secret bids. This point is not stipulated in the government's promulgated laws and regulations. What is an open bid and what is a secret bid is difficult to understand. (4) The head office once ordered more than 10 million worth of flour bags. According to the investigation results, why did the Finance Department pay all the money before seeing the goods, and without the consent of the Audit Office? (5) Why was Bingji Company, which won the bid for the canned food sold by the office's distribution office, not required to pay a deposit, and why was it allowed to pick up the goods in batches? This is unreasonable in terms of both reason and law. (6) Hu Keshi was transferred to the position of Director of the Fishery Management Office, but there was no appointment order from Huo Baoshu, Director of the office. This proves that Li Zhuomin, the Deputy Director of the office, exercised his power arbitrarily. (7) The treatment of all employees in the UNRRA barge assembly plant is twice as high as that of the employees in the UNRRA headquarters. This matter was not approved by Director Huo, and it was also created by Li Zhuomin's arbitrary power. The Supervision Envoy's Office has been conducting detailed investigations with the office on the above points in recent days to find out the truth.</p>

They were taken to the Huangpu Police Station together. After a strict interrogation by Section Member Song, it was learned that there were still accomplices hiding in the Jicheng Inn on Shanxi Road. The police were immediately dispatched to the inn, and five or six more brokers were arrested and dealt with together.</p>

The district court had summoned Song Ziliang, the general manager of the company, but since Song had traveled to the United States and had not returned, and the company's assistant manager, Lu Pinqin, was unable to respond to the summons due to stomach pain, they sent a letter to the district court yesterday stating that they had entrusted Secretary Liu Fengsheng to represent them in court, where he was questioned by Judge Zhong Xianda. Liu simply answered "no" or "don't know" to each point of the interrogation, such as whether there were any commercial dealings with the American Wade Trading Company, the American Hongyun Company, whether they had distributed Hongyun brand cigarettes, and the rumored that Fuzhong Company had received a guarantee of US$50 million from Hongyun Company.

<h3>Dance Hall Industry Proposes: Organize Institutions to Train Employees in Vocational Skills Before Banning Dancing; Provide Basic Literacy Education to Dancers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, representatives of the dance hall industry, including Sun Hongyuan and Zhu Yongming, took a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau to visit Director Wu. Since Director Wu was out on official business, they left the petition and returned, and plan to visit him again tomorrow.</p>
<p>The dance hall industry's petition proposes that before dancing is banned, the Social Affairs Bureau should work with the Dance Hall Industry Association to organize a vocational skills training institution for dance hall employees. During their free time from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau should send personnel to guide employees and teach them various vocational skills, and provide basic literacy education to dancers. After the employees have mastered their skills, the Social Affairs Bureau can place them in various factories. After the dancers have gained basic knowledge, they can take on nursing or other occupations. The expenses of all training institutions will be raised by the industry association. The industry also believes that the purpose of banning dancing is to save money. In order to implement savings, the Social Affairs Bureau can order each dance hall not to sell expensive drinks such as foreign wines, so as not to consume resources, and at the same time stop issuing new dance hall licenses and stop registering new dancers to limit them.</p>
<h3>Solatium for the Fubo Case: 15 Million Per Person</h3>

<h3>The Car Rental Issue Has No Results, a Committee Will Be Formed to Adjudicate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to adjust the rickshaw rental issue, the Social Affairs Bureau convened the cart merchants and rickshaw pullers for the third time yesterday for mediation. The cart merchants demanded that the rent for each shift be 6 jiao, calculated at 95% of last month's workers' cost of living index. The rickshaw pullers requested that it be calculated at 65%. According to the July index, the merchants' request would be about 15,000 yuan for each shift, while the rickshaw pullers would only agree to within 10,000 yuan. The two sides were far apart and the negotiations were unsuccessful. According to the Social Affairs Bureau, the average income of rickshaw pullers for each shift is currently 30,000 yuan. Due to physical strength and other reasons, they can only work 20 shifts per month, with a monthly income of 600,000 yuan. Therefore, the rent cannot be too high, otherwise the rickshaw pullers will not be able to make a living. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to form a committee with relevant agencies to adjudicate the matter.</p>
<h3>Falsified a Contract and Wanted to Defraud His Girlfriend of Money; Hardware Merchant Is Charged with Two Crimes; Xu Haiming Is Suspected of Perjury</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Two years ago, hardware merchant Li Shifan fell in love with a young girl, Lu Ying (Lu Xiaoying). Li claimed to have no wife and obtained more than four taels of gold jewelry from Lu to secure a house in order to live in it after marriage. His wife found out about it, moved in first, and Lu, realizing that she had been deceived, broke off contact with Li. Later, Lu's sister became ill and entrusted Lu to manage the Meiguang Shoe Shine Company, which she ran on her own. In June of this year, Li borrowed the lease contract signed between Li and Lu from Li Tianxiang, the owner of the Meiguang Ice Room, and privately carved the name stamps of the Meiguang Company and Lu Ying. He forged a contract stating that Lu Ying and Li Shifan were partners in opening the Meiguang Company and attempted to defraud Lu. Lu reported the matter to the Xincheng Police Precinct, which requested the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. Li then colluded with shipper Xu Haiming to give false testimony during the investigation. After the prosecutor investigated, he determined that Li had committed forgery and fraud, and Xu had committed perjury. Yesterday, they were both prosecuted.</p>

<h3>The Three Female Ticket Takers at the Majestic Theater Become the Focus of the Labor-Management Dispute; Mediation Failed, the Theater Requests Arbitration</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gu Ruofeng, deputy section chief of the mediation section of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and inspector Zhu Guilin, convened both parties at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to mediate the labor unrest in fifteen cinemas. The representatives of the capital were Wei Yunqing, Zhou Hongguang, Shi Tingpan, Hu Zhifan, and Zhou Yihua. The labor representatives present were Liu Guisheng, Cao Yongfu, Huang Yulin, and He Changgen. Huang Zuoxin and Qian Dayou of the Criminal Division of the Police Headquarters, and Fang Rusheng of the General Labor Union also attended to assist in the mediation. The labor-management dispute was quite intense during the meeting. The capital demanded that the labor side compensate for the losses during the strike and punish those who led and incited the strike. The labor side expressed dissatisfaction with the capital's employment of non-union members and the fact that the Majestic Theater still ordered three female ticket takers to serve. After repeated mediation, it was not until 1:00 PM that an agreement was reached that the three female ticket takers at the Majestic Theater would be transferred to the office of other first-run cinemas. The vacant position will be replaced by people transferred from other cinemas. The remaining unresolved matters will be mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau which will convene representatives of both parties again tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The three female ticket takers at the Majestic Theater continued to serve in the theater yesterday afternoon. The Cinema Industry Association has scheduled a general meeting this morning to discuss the matter. The association expressed its dissatisfaction with the Social Affairs Bureau's notice ordering the three female ticket takers to temporarily stop working and has submitted the matter to the municipal government for arbitration.</p>
<p>According to reporters, the municipal government believes that the current employee strike violates the General Mobilization Law and is studying measures to deal with it. The municipal government will also thoroughly revise the minutes signed by both labor and management in the past to prevent loopholes and prevent future disputes when resolving the dispute.</p>

<h3>Applying Tax to Million-Dollar Estates; Tax Amount Highest for Yuchi Qiaqing; Tax Bureau Conducts Side Investigations, Already Determining Over a Hundred Units</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] In the great city of Shanghai, with a population of over four million, someone dies and someone is born every moment of every day, 24 hours a day. According to statistics from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, the monthly death toll is at least 1,600 people. Leaving aside those who die on the streets and those of the common class, assuming that each of Shanghai's 20 funeral homes has an average of one wealthy client per day, there would be more than 7,200 deaths of the asset-owning class in a year. These deceased individuals are excellent targets for the Direct Tax Bureau to levy inheritance tax. (It is assumed that there are many who qualify as the minimum for inheritance tax is one million yuan.) From last year to the present, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has already investigated and determined the inheritance tax for over a hundred units, and is currently investigating dozens more. Among the more than one hundred units that have been determined, the highest tax amount is undoubtedly for Yuchi Qiaqing. When Old Mr. Yuchi passed away in Chongqing in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], this city had not yet been recovered. His estate in Shanghai was only reported to the Direct Tax Bureau by his estate management committee after the victory. As far as we know, Old Mr. Yuchi's real estate, such as the Great Shanghai Cinema, the Jinghua Restaurant on Fourth Avenue, Fuzhi Lane on Guangxi Road, and Chunghua New Village on Jing'an Temple Road, are all well-known prime properties.</p>
<p>Minor Disputes Among the Yuchi Brothers</p>
<p>In April of this year, the elder Mr. Yuchi's estate caused a dispute among his three sons, Shun'en, Shunmao, and Shunwei. Near Chengdu Road on Jing'an Temple Road, Old Mr. Yuchi had two pieces of real estate totaling twelve mu, six li, and six hao (including the Goldfish Market). These were originally managed by the eldest son, Shun'en. At the estate management committee meeting, Shun'en suddenly reported to his two younger brothers that the real estate had been sold to someone else in February for 158 gold bars. Shunmao and Shunwei found this a bit suspicious. Based on the current value, the real estate was worth over 1,000 gold bars, ten times the amount reported by Shun'en. The two sides refused to concede, and for a time, the dispute became quite heated. Later, the eldest sister's husband, Jiang Yiping, stepped in to mediate, which prevented litigation. From this one incident, we can get a glimpse of the richness of Yuchi Qiaqing's estate. However, the inheritance tax law stipulates that the valuation of the estate should be based on the value on the date of the deceased's death. Therefore, the elder Mr. Yuchi's inheritance tax amount is not as astonishing as might be expected, but it is not too small either, probably around two to three billion yuan!</p>
<p>Tax Amount Determined for Shi Shengzhi</p>
<p>After Yuchi Qiaqing, the next should be Shen Lianfang. Shen Lianfang's name is also quite familiar in Shanghai. He was a tycoon in the silk cocoon industry, having served as chairman of the Silk Cocoon Guild of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, vice president of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and director-general of the Zhabei Charity Association. His businesses, such as Hua An Fire and Marine Insurance Company, Hengfeng Silk Store, Jiangyin Liyong Yarn Factory, Shanghai Fengye Insurance Company, China Silk Industry Bank, and Suzhou Taihe Flour Mill, owned many residences and properties in this city. Although the total value of his estate is not as high as Yuchi Qiaqing's, his death date was later than Yuchi's, so his tax amount, based on the current value for tax determination, is not much different from the elder Mr. Yuchi's.</p>
<p>Shi Zhaozeng, known as Shengzhi, the eldest brother of Shi Zhaoji, a veteran of the diplomatic circles, passed away this year at the age of 82. In the late Qing Dynasty, he served as a county magistrate, reaching the rank of second-class Jiangxi Taoist official. He served as Consul General in New York in the United States. After returning to China, he worked in the railway industry, successively serving as director of the Hanyang Iron Factory in Hubei, concurrently managing the Beijing-Hankou Railway project, and director-general of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In the early years of the Republic of China, he once again served as a diplomat. In the 11th year of the Republic [1922], he switched from politics to business, founding the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant and serving as chairman of Wing Hang Bank and Jiu An Industrial Company, among others. Shi Shengzhi was good at being an official and good at doing business. His estate is also indeed considerable. Shi's sons and nephews are well aware of national laws and tax obligations. They prepared an estate inventory within the deadline, and the Direct Tax Bureau determined his tax amount very smoothly. Shi Jiumao, general manager of Daxin Zhen Piao Printing and Dyeing Weaving Factory, is also a well-known figure among the Ningbo expatriates in Shanghai. He started as an apprentice at Shentai Chang Cotton Cloth Store in Xiaodongmen. In the 25th year of the Republic [1936], he opened Daxin Zhen Piao Printing and Dyeing Weaving Factory, Tongqing Cotton Cloth Store, and served as general manager of China Investment Management Company. Although his inheritance tax is less than Yuchi's, Shi's, and Shen's, it will still be in the hundreds of millions of yuan.</p>
<p>A Well-Managed Concubine</p>
<p>The well-known units currently under investigation by the Direct Tax Bureau include Mu Ouchu, the former director of the Shanghai Pre-War Gauze Exchange, who died in Chongqing. His main assets are the Deda and Housheng yarn factories. Also under investigation are Xiang Shengwu, the general manager of Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Xu Dexin, the manager of Dazhong Hardware Machinery Factory, who recently passed away. Among them, the wealthiest estate, which the Direct Tax Bureau is currently focusing on, is that of Sun Zhang Biru, the concubine of Sun Hengfu, the general manager of Siming Bank. This Mrs. Sun was good at accumulating and managing assets during her lifetime. She owned over 20 houses in the Wujiaochang area of Changning Road, and individual residences and Western-style houses on Yuyuan Road and Jessfield Road, as well as a sedan car and a jeep. She also owned shares in Chuanshan Shipping Company and flour mills. In her hometown of Cixi, she also owned residences, farmland, and shops. The safe deposit box at Siming Bank also contains numerous jewelry, gold bars, and diamond rings. In addition to notifying the heirs of Sun Zhang Biru's estate to declare, the Tax Bureau is also conducting a side investigation.</p>
<p>Inheritors of Lo Ka Ling Get a Bargain</p>
<p>Inheritance tax can be said to be a new tax in China. Although it was implemented in the rear during the War of Resistance on July 1, 1940, it was only levied in the recovered areas on September 2, 1945. The tax law stipulates that if the deceased died in the recovered areas before September 2, 1945, the portion of their estate in the recovered areas is tax-exempt, thus benefiting the heirs of the Lo Ka Ling, the wife of Silas Aaron Hardoon. However, those who died in the rear after July 1, 1940, are subject to tax regardless of whether their estate is in the rear or the recovered areas, such as Yuchi Qiaqing and Mu Ouchu. When the Legislative Yuan passed the Inheritance Tax Law, it did not anticipate that the legal tender would depreciate so much, so the minimum threshold for inheritance tax was set at one million yuan. Recently, the Tax Administration decided to raise it to 30 million yuan, but with prices constantly rising, 30 million yuan seems insignificant today, so the Tax Administration is still considering revising it.</p>

<h3>Drought in Water Country; Both Banks of Qiantang River; Soil Cracks and Leaves Wither; Disaster Situation More Severe in Eastern Zhejiang Mountainous Areas</h3>
<p>Huangni Water Used for Drinking in Haining and Tongxiang Counties</p>
<p>Currently, the disaster area is widespread on both banks of the Qiantang River. Counties in eastern and western Zhejiang that have reported drought conditions include: Hangzhou, Haining, Haiyan, Yuhang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Lin'an, Yueqing, Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yuyao, Yin County, Huangyan, Xuanping, Wenling, Yongjia, Linhai, Tongxiang,  Yang, and Wu, totaling ten counties, nearly one-third of the province's total. The area north of the railway in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou is still okay, but the cracking of the soil has become a widespread phenomenon south of the railway. Riverbeds have dried up, and steamers cannot operate. What is particularly bad is that the drinking water has become a major problem in various counties. In counties such as Haining and Tongxiang, only muddy yellow water can be found, which will greatly affect the health of farmers. However, they are already very happy to have water to drink. In some places such as Haining, Yuanmu, Chengdong, Wengbu, and Xucun, there is no water available for washing faces or bathing, and drinking tea has become a luxury. When passersby are thirsty and ask villagers for water, they have to run to several homes to get two wine cups of yellow mud water. Therefore, there are no idlers in the villages. Men, women, old and young, even children, take water buckets, even tiles, and run to the Qiantang River, more than a dozen miles away, to fetch water to drink. This kind of hardship is unimaginable for people in the city who drink tap water.</p>
<p>Fifty Water Pumps Hopefully Sent to Zhejiang Immediately for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Originally, the fields in the Hangzhou-Haining area relied on West Lake water for irrigation. The people of Hangzhou, thanks to the blessings of the West Lake, send the lake water to the counties of Hangzhou and Haining, and let them bear the burden of grain taxes. After the disaster occurred in the area along the Shangtang River this year, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works opened West Lake water on the 16th. However, according to Director Shen, "Since the 16th, the water level has dropped by 5 centimeters after 24 hours of release. After a total of 68 hours of release, the water level has dropped by 10.5 centimeters, releasing a total of 507,000 cubic meters of lake water. However, the weather is extremely dry, and the evaporation and infiltration are extremely high. The water level of the Shangtang River has only risen by 2 to 3 centimeters. The lake water only reaches Xiaomao Bridge near Linping, which is 23 kilometers from Hangzhou and 29 kilometers from Haining." Because Mayor Zhou loves West Lake, he seems reluctant to open the lake water, so it is opened and stopped, as if only to respond to the opinions of others. After Chairman Shen personally inspected the disaster situation on the Shangtang River on the 22nd, he ordered the water to be opened for another ten days. At the same time, he asked the water plant to run the water pumps for four more hours to draw water into the Shangtang River. On the other hand, the Zhejiang branch of the soon-to-be-closed Executive Yuan borrowed three 6-inch water pumps from the Tangjiang Bureau to draw water in Chang'an to help irrigation. At the same time, Directors Sun and Zhu and Chief Pi of the Construction Department went to Shanghai to ask the Executive Yuan to expedite the transport of the 50 water pumps originally allocated to Zhejiang to Zhejiang to save the drought. Among them, the components of 20 pumps have arrived in Hangzhou City and will be distributed to the disaster areas in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou after the other components arrive. After the remaining 30 pumps arrive in Hangzhou, they will be distributed to the remaining counties in eastern and western Zhejiang that have been affected by the disaster to provide free water pumping.</p>
<p>Autumn Harvest Discounted to 70% if Water Available Soon</p>
<p>However, the affected counties not only need water, but are in urgent need of water. If there is enough water for irrigation soon, the autumn harvest will be discounted to 70%. Without water, the harvest will of course be hopeless, and many farmers do not trust the water of the Qiantang River. Because it is salty. During the great drought in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], farmers also used river water, but the crops withered and the ears did not bear fruit, resulting in a big harvest failure! What's more, farmers need water now, but the water pumps are still on Fuxing Island! According to the estimates of Xuanping farmers: the wages for the autumn harvest are 12,000 yuan per worker, and 4 workers are needed per mu. The cost of food is equivalent to 1 dan of grain, and the cost of sowing, construction, and fertilizer per mu is equivalent to 2 dan of grain. The rent per mu is 2 dan. If each mu can still harvest 5 dan, it will still lose more than 1 dan. Some tenant farmers still borrow money to grow rice. Borrowing 1 dan requires returning 1.5 dan. Even in good years, they are quite stretched. Now that there is a drought, their lives are unimaginable. In desperation, they have to entrust their fate to the gods. Currently, Wuyi, Wenling, Yin County, Zhuji, Yueqing, and Haining are all praying to the gods and saints, welcoming the dragon, and praying for rain. In some places, they carry the Bodhisattva to tour the disaster area, hoping to touch the heart of the Bodhisattva and drop some sweet rain, but not a single drop of rain has fallen, and a lot of money has been spent. Some places are publicly levied, 20,000 yuan per mu, and from this base, one can imagine the scale of the expenditure. The provincial government is still actively rescuing the situation (the effectiveness of which depends on the speed of implementation) and has not yet made passive relief plans. They hope that farmers will switch to growing miscellaneous grains to make up for the need for food. However, in the case of poor harvests and droughts, in addition to coping with the mandatory requisition and borrowing, farmers still have to rely on their own miscellaneous grains to survive, which may have become a difficult situation. Therefore, I deeply hope that the authorities can have a deeper level of relief plans to alleviate the current suffering of rural Zhejiang. The great drought of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] is about to be repeated, but we deeply hope to let the suffering villagers suffer less. (Reporter Huang Xingtian)</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Jiaxing on the 25th] Due to continuous days of drought without rain, the fields in various towns and villages in this county have cracked, and insect plagues are frequent. A disaster has formed, especially for early crops such as sweet potatoes, green hemp, and sugarcane, the losses are even greater. If it does not rain again within the week, the autumn harvest will be hopeless.</p>
<h3>Linping Drought Area; Building Ponds to Store Water and Sell at a Good Price; Saving One Mu of Farmland Crops Costs as Much as 300,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou on the 24th] In Yuhang, storing water to irrigate fields has benefited more than 3,000 mu, but this amount is too small, and there is no water to store elsewhere at all. Even if there is some that can be stored, it is occupied by private individuals. Here is a story: In the Linping area, some farmers built ponds to store water and sell it at a good price. For those who want to draw water from the pond to irrigate with old-fashioned manual water carts, they need to pay 60,000 yuan for every 100 turns of the water cart. The efficiency of the manual water cart is very low. According to the actual experience of farmers, this amount of water is only enough to irrigate two fen of land. That is to say: to save one mu of farmland crops, it costs 300,000 yuan, which is about the market price of one dan of rice. This is beyond the ability of ordinary farmers to afford, so they have to let the eared rice wither and turn yellow. Some sugarcane growers, because the profit is higher, are competing to hire workers to irrigate. But when the pond water is drawn dry, the fields along the Shangtang River are still bound to become barren.</p>
<p>Three water pumps are pumping water in Chang'an, Haining at 6 a.m. This is one of the drought relief stations set up by the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan. The picture shows the water release situation.</p>

<p>Ministry of Food Announces Measures for Limited Flour Transit at Beijing, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai Ports; August Quota for Fourth District Flour Transit Set at 300,000 Bags</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with the National General Mobilization Law, the Ministry of Food will immediately regulate the circulation of food in the Yangtze River provinces. The four major food items, rice, grain, wheat, and flour, in Shanghai were previously ordered by the Executive Yuan last year to require prior approval from the Ministry for transit. Furthermore, in April of this year, the aforementioned four food items in Jiangsu Province experienced a sharp price increase due to large-scale procurement and transportation. Regulations were established allowing free circulation of grain, rice, wheat, and flour within Jiangsu Province and to Beijing and Shanghai. Transportation to other provinces must be approved by the Ministry. Recently, the Ministry has received numerous requests to lift the restrictions, and the Ministry has stipulated the following: (1) Outward transportation of rice from Shanghai will continue to be handled in accordance with the rice transit measures approved by the Executive Yuan. (2) Export of wheat from Shanghai will remain temporarily restricted. (3) Food in the provinces along the Yangtze River should circulate freely. However, transportation beyond the Yangtze River estuary to other coastal provinces for sale must be reported to and approved by the Ministry before export is allowed. (4) Starting in August, flour in Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Province will follow the flour transit quota measures approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry will announce the transit quantity each month based on production and sales conditions. It is reported that the approved transit quantity for the Fourth District in August is 300,000 bags. The measures for limited flour transit are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to ensure sufficient food supply for the residents of northern and southern provinces such as Ping, Tianjin, Qing, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, and to develop the flour industry, a limited quota system for flour transit will be implemented starting in August of the 36th year.</p>
<p>(2) Flour transit is limited to the three ports of Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing.</p>
<p>(3) The monthly transit quota will be determined and announced by the Ministry of Food based on production and sales conditions, and relevant agencies and organizations will be notified for compliance.</p>
<p>(4) The monthly transit quota approved by the Ministry of Food will be distributed fairly among the factories by the Fourth District Flour Industry Association (hereinafter referred to as the Fourth District Flour Association) based on their production volume. A detailed distribution list must be submitted to the Ministry of Food for record. Transit beyond the quota is prohibited, except for cases deemed necessary and specially approved by the Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>(5) Manufacturers located in Jiangsu Province and Beijing and Shanghai who are members of the Fourth District Flour Association may apply for transit. The five factories of Fuxin, Fufeng, Maoxin, Huafeng, and Yutong will have separate transit quotas determined by the Ministry of Food and are not subject to this quota distribution.</p>
<p>(6) Grain merchants who have registered with the Ministry of Food and hold a business license for grain distribution may purchase flour for external sales. However, the selling manufacturer must apply for transit on behalf of the merchant and guarantee the merchant's status as a legitimate grain distributor. Procurement and transportation certificates issued by local government agencies to local grain merchants are invalid.</p>
<p>(7) Whether transporting the flour themselves or selling it to legitimate grain merchants, manufacturers applying for transit must not exceed the quantity allocated by the Fourth District Flour Association. However, any unused quota from the previous month may be combined with the current month's quota.</p>
<p>(8) Manufacturers may choose the port for transit. Before the flour is shipped, they must apply to the Ministry of Food to have the customs or tax authorities at the transit destination verify and approve the release.</p>
<p>(9) The customs and tax authorities mentioned in the previous article are the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai, the Jinling Customs in Nanjing, and the Zhenjiang Goods Tax Bureau in Zhenjiang. The customs will not release the flour without receiving notification from the Ministry of Food. The Zhenjiang Goods Tax Bureau will not issue tax invoices without receiving notification from the Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>(10) If legitimate manufacturers purchase flour from provinces and cities upstream of the Yangtze River outside the areas stipulated in Article 5 of these measures and transport it through the Yangtze River estuary to coastal areas, they must first submit the purchase and sales location, quantity, grain merchant license, and flour mill certificate to the Ministry of Food for verification. Upon approval, the local customs or tax authorities will be notified to release the flour.</p>
<p>(11) The Ministry of Food's transfer of flour to supply military and civilian needs will be reported by the Shanghai General Warehouse to the Ministry of Food, which will then notify the Jianghai Customs to release the flour, without being subject to the restrictions of these measures.</p>
<p>(12) These measures will take effect from the date of their announcement.</p>
<p>Active Off-Exchange Trading, Chinese Stocks Continue to Advance</p>
<p>Chinese stocks continued to advance yesterday. Stimulated by material and financial news, a Mr. Yang covered 40 million shares shorted off-exchange. Large off-exchange traders thrived, aggressively raising prices to over 252 yuan. As a result, the exchange was also forced to rise sharply. Near noon, there was a pullback, as shorts were covered and long positions were taken.</p>
<p>The market opened steadily. After Yongsha opened, numbers 219 and others sold at high prices. Later, numbers 12, 73, 224, 102, and 85 came in to buy, and number 130 even bought current Yongsha, pushing the price up to 240 yuan. A constant supply of funds prevented high prices from lasting. Later, due to a sudden increase in off-exchange interest rates to 1.5 and 1.95 jiao, many sellers appeared, driving the price down to 232 yuan. At this point, the buying side suddenly strengthened, and Mr. Yang aggressively covered shorts off-exchange. Xiangshu brand arbitrarily raised prices to over 252 yuan, causing the price to rise to highs of 249 and 250 yuan. The morning surge passed, and the market closed lower at 243 and 244 yuan at noon.

<p>The trend for mung beans softened, and broad beans lingered in a weak state, falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Transactions for raw wheat were scarce, and the market was flat. Sales of red sorghum were sluggish, falling back by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. With new supplies arriving soon, optimism was not warranted. Sales of corn were weak, declining by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

<p>Shantou Shipping Company Responsible for Salvaging "Heichao Maru" Oil Tanker</p>
<p>A large oil tanker, the "Heichao Maru," with a deadweight of 10,000 tons, sank in Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan, having been bombed during the war. The Taiwan shipping authorities initially considered it of little use and began dismantling it. After the government learned of this, and realizing that the country was in dire need of oil tankers, they telegraphed Chairman Wei to order a halt to the dismantling and sent personnel to investigate. The ship was built in Japan in Showa year 14 (1939), was only six years old, and had a very high speed, making it one of the largest oil tankers in the country. Dismantling it would be a great pity. It is now understood that the government has instructed the China Oil Tanker Company to expedite the salvage and repair of the ship to increase oil transportation capacity. It is also reported that the repair project plan has been finalized and construction will begin in the coming days.</p>
<p>Dried Lily Bulbs Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Dried lily bulbs have continued to rise in price because Cantonese merchants have been actively purchasing them, and supplies in stock are gradually dwindling. Since prices are relatively low, owners cannot guarantee profits, so the market is gradually rebounding. Yesterday, the market price rose by another 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, selling for 720,000 yuan, but there was not much supply.</p>
<p>China Trust Bureau Purchases Over 36,000 Bales of Foreign Cotton</p>

For the most part, the CIF foreign exchange was telegraphed by the National Bank to foreign manufacturers. The foreign banks and foreign importers involved expressed satisfaction, believing that the government's solution to the long-standing case of cotton that had arrived nearly a year ago demonstrated consideration for the difficulties faced by businesses and would contribute to the future of China's international trade. The Central Trust Bureau has been in frequent contact with various weaving mills to discuss the issue of yarn delivery. It is understood that the factories can first advance a portion of cotton yarn for export. The remainder will be delivered within one and a half months, and it is hoped that the foreign exchange paid for the cotton can be recovered with a surplus in the short term.</p>
<p>Actual Sales Active, Production Gradually Decreasing: Yarn and Cloth Prices Rising Daily; Textile Mills Association Appeals for Increased Power Supply</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, told reporters yesterday that the recent surge in yarn and cloth prices is due to the gradual increase in actual sales, but the decreasing production volume is also a major factor. The main reason for the decline in production volume is the unreliable power supply. Considering the spindles owned by China Textile Construction Company in this city, if the power supply were sufficient, 840,000 spindles could be operated day and night. However, due to insufficient power, only an average of over 600,000 spindles can be operated day and night. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the municipal government will actively find ways to ensure the power supply for production enterprises, especially by reducing wasteful and unnecessary power consumption.</p>
<p>[Further news] The National Textile Mills Association also telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting that measures be taken to increase the power supply for production enterprises in various regions to facilitate increased production and stabilize prices.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Rises Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market surged due to the influx of capital fleeing Hong Kong, which resulted in an overabundance of cash. Speculators in the market were actively pushing prices up, and buyers were also actively purchasing, leading to a rapid rise in prices.</p>

The final price was 18.9 million yuan, continuing to rise by 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse also rose by 600,000 yuan to 13.2 million yuan, and Light Double Horse surged by 650,000 yuan to 12.05 million yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, ranging from 500,000 to 800,000 or 900,000 yuan.</p>
<p>More Buyers for Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rising trend in the cotton cloth market intensified. Buyers and dyers were purchasing low-grade fine cloth, which stimulated traders and speculators, leading to a scramble to buy. Sellers raised prices, and the market became increasingly profitable. At around 10:30 AM, Longtou fine cloth rose to 494,000 yuan. Later, it was reported that China Textile Construction Company had set lower cloth prices, leading to some profit-taking sales. The final price was 485,000 yuan, continuing to rise by 15,000 yuan compared to the previous month. The prices of other grades of fine cloth, such as Wufu Caiqiu and Yanghe, also rose by 15,000 to 31,000 yuan. Sijunzi and Jinlian Miaowu and other types of flannel rose sharply because China Textile Construction flannel had not yet been put on sale, so prices rose by around 30,000 yuan. Other types of bleached cloth, coarse cloth, raw cloth, printed cloth, and blue Shilin cloth all rose by varying amounts, ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 or 40,000 yuan.</p>

Yarn factories in the city aggressively purchased, and buyers from other areas also added to their orders, causing market prices to rise.

<p>In addition, the maximum monthly amount of foreign exchange available for Schedules 1 and 3A, originally set at US$2 million for Schedule 1 and US$2.5 million for Schedule 3A, remains unchanged. However, whether the full amount can be allocated will depend on the Foreign Exchange Equilibrium Fund Committee's monthly assessment of the foreign exchange position.</p>
<p>Tea Market Sluggish</p>
<p>Recently, trading in foreign tea markets has remained stagnant. Because exporters have not yet received responses from overseas to the various grades they have solicited, buying interest remains sluggish. Sellers, since the announcement last week by the authorities of new measures for managing foreign exchange, have stabilized their mindset and are not discouraged, so supply and demand remain balanced throughout the process. Overall, this situation is likely to continue to be quiet for the time being. As for domestic sales, both local shops and out-of-town buyers report a lack of sales, and the situation remains flat.</p>
<p>Wool Market Prices Chaotic</p>
<p>Yesterday, wool prices became chaotic again. Bids from various shops varied widely, and trading was mostly observed by local merchants, with the exception of some purchases by out-of-town buyers.

In the afternoon, due to severe shortages and high demand from all parties, prices rose to 6.6 million</p>
<h3>Minister of Education Chu Returns to Beijing Yesterday After Visiting Shanghai, Hu Shih, Mei Yi-qi and Others Arrive South on the Same Plane to Attend Preparatory Committee for the Academia Sinica Academician Election</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua, accompanied by Secretary Fang Chih-mao, flew to Peiping, Tientsin and the Northeast to inspect them a week ago. Yesterday at 5 p.m., he returned to Shanghai from Peiping on the Sky Master. Peking University President Hu Shih, Professor Qian Duansheng, Tsinghua University President Mei Yi-qi, Professor Pan Guangdan, and Peiping Research Institute Director Li Shu-hua and others, a total of five people, came south on the same plane. Wu Shao-shu, Executive Director of the Shanghai Youth Corps, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, and many others went to Longhua Airport to welcome them. After disembarking from the plane, Chu went to his private residence to rest and took a train back to Beijing last night. According to Secretary Fang Chih-mao, Chu's trip was very detailed. He inspected various schools in Peiping and said that Minister Chu was very saddened by the destruction of schools in the Northeast. It will definitely not be possible to restore them in a day or two. The Ministry of Education will gradually find ways to improve them. Fortunately, local officials have agreed to provide full assistance, and they will be able to gradually enrich them. At the same time, in addition to the students in the Northeast who have dropped out of school and have been transferred to other schools one after another, the universities in the Northeast will increase the number of classes in the next semester to allow students who have dropped out of school to continue their studies.

<p>Hu Shih Willing to be a Voter in the General Election</p>
<p>[Another Report] Hu Shih of Peking University arrived in Shanghai yesterday and stayed at the International Hotel. When reporters visited him last night, Mr. Hu was also present. Mr. Hu told us: "This trip is to participate in the preparatory committee meeting for the Academia Sinica academician election to be held in Beijing tomorrow (the 28th). The committee is divided into three groups: mathematics and physics, biology, and humanities, with five members in each group. The meeting of the preparatory committee will review and organize the list of academician candidates and submit it to the first academician council meeting to be held at the end of next month for review. The final decision will be made when the second council meeting is held next spring. The number of elected academicians may be between eighty and one hundred." When asked by the reporter whether it was true that Hu Shih would participate in the election of senators in Peiping, Hu Shih said: "I am willing to be a voter and have entrusted my national identity card to a friend to write the ballot for me." Hu Shih then expressed his views on the general election, saying: Democratic politics is education and training. This is the first time our country has conducted a general election. Whether it is good or bad, it is always a kind of experience and lesson. The learning method lies in practice. It should not be regarded as a difficult task and should be done seriously. When asked by the reporter whether Hu Shih would participate in the election, Hu Shih said: "I am also willing to be a voter." When the reporter asked Hu Shih about his thoughts on General Wedemeyer's farewell statement the day before, Hu Shih said that he had been ill for more than a week and had not seen the newspaper of that day before he left. He only saw the Shen Bao of the 24th on the plane yesterday, so he could not talk about it. Regarding the issue of the treatment of professors in Peiping and Tianjin, Hu Shih said that after the adjustment of the treatment of public educators this time, Peiping increased by 300,000 yuan, which is not enough to buy 30 kilograms of rice or a small bag of flour. The lives of professors are unspeakably miserable, which is a mistake of the government. Hu Shih had been ill for more than a week and did not intend to attend the meeting. However, because Fu Mengzhen and Tao Menghe, who participated in the humanities group of the committee, are now abroad, if he does not attend, there will not be enough quorum, so he came south despite his illness. Hu Shih will go to Beijing today to attend the preparatory committee meeting for the Academia Sinica academician election and also intends to attend the UNESCO China Committee. After the meeting, he will return to Shanghai by plane to return to Peiping.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Holds Principals' Meeting Yesterday and Decides Maximum Tuition Fees for Private Schools: Elementary School 500,000, Junior High School 800,000, Senior High School 1 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The standard for collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees for private primary and secondary schools in this city for the next semester was determined by the private schools themselves to be 600,000 for elementary school, 900,000 for junior high school, and 1.2 million for senior high school. Most students' parents felt that the standard was too high and they could not afford it. The Municipal Government specially convened a meeting of more than 100 principals of private primary and secondary schools in the conference room at 3:30 p.m. yesterday to discuss ways to appropriately reduce fees. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, accompanied by Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, Deputy Director, and others. Mayor Wu first gave a speech, saying that since the amount of tuition and miscellaneous fees for private schools was announced, he had received dozens of petitions from students' parents, all saying that the fees for private schools were too high and pointing out that the expenses of some schools were not made public, expressing their opposition. After investigation, it was found that Nanyang Middle School's expenses were completely open, and the interest on deposits was distributed to teachers. On the contrary, the expenses of some private schools were all controlled by the principal alone, and the lives of teachers were unspeakably miserable. These two opposite situations have been confirmed, and it has been decided to reward and punish them separately. It should be known that the outside world calls private schools "academic shops" and puts forward the slogan of "anti-academic shops," which is the greatest shame for the government and the education community. Mr. Wu said in an angry tone. I have decided to ask the school's board of directors to replace the principal to establish a noble style in the education community. Mr. Wu then said that the number of free places set up by various private schools is mostly not true to the name, with the lower ones only accounting for 4%, and even using the student aid funds donated by the outside world as their own free places, which is extremely indignant. Then, principals Jiang Jizhou, Cui Jianwu and others reported on the process of setting tuition fees for private schools, saying: At that time, because the exchange rate was uncertain, they were sincerely afraid of price fluctuations, so the number set was slightly higher. At the same time, in view of the increase in tuition fees for private universities, primary and secondary schools had to increase. Mayor Wu immediately reprimanded them for their merchant habits, and the amount of fees should meet their own needs. After a heated discussion, the key points of the resolution were as follows: (1) In the last symposium, it was decided that the number of half-fee and free places should be sufficient, the economy should be open, the fees should be deposited in designated banks, and the interest should be used for school expenses, and 70% of the expenses should be paid to teachers' salaries. The above items must be strictly implemented. (2) The maximum tuition fees for each school: 500,000 for elementary school, 800,000 for junior high school, and 1 million for senior high school. However, private primary and secondary schools with a long history, complete equipment, excellent performance, and open economy may collect fees of 600,000, 900,000, and 1.2 million after submitting an application to the Education Bureau for approval. (3) During the semester, schools must not arbitrarily collect any fees. If there are any violations of the Education Bureau's regulations, such as cleverly establishing names, falsely reporting, etc., once discovered, the Education Bureau will strictly punish them or take them over for city management.</p>

<h3>Key to the League Tennis Championship Lies in the Game Between the Physical Education Association and Jinlan Today, The Outcome of Shanghai vs. Green Light is Related to the Future</h3>
<p>Today is the fourth match of the tennis league. The match between the Physical Education Association and Jinlan will determine the fate of the championship. In the past three matches, the Physical Education Association has scored the most points among the teams. Jinlan has played twice and scored a lot of points, and also intends to compete for the championship. If the Physical Education Association passes this hurdle, it will be easy to win. The other match between the Shanghai Association and Green Light is also crucial. At present, Shanghai is only three points behind the Physical Education Association, and the hope of winning the championship is not over. The key to their gains and losses with the Physical Education Association depends on the results of the two teams' games against Jinlan and Green Light. In the remaining three games today, Lianghua should be able to defeat Zhongyang, Meilu vs. Railway, and Enpai vs. Lianmei are evenly matched.</p>
