<p>〔本報廣州十日電〕由於大鈔發行，此間金融又略有波動，港幫直線上升，由二六〇　至三二〇，一般物價遣而報帳，據系：此次外幫漲風，稀由滬抽來，二漲勢則雖較為　烈，足證穗遊資力量比滬地爲強大。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕國行十日上午接獲總行發行大鈔之通電，並未附其他指示，一萬元以上之大鈔尙未運來，隨大鈔出籠之消息物價普漲，最速者爲金鈔黑市。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十日電〕自大鈔發行消息抵濟後，各物一致趨漲，計麵粉漲一萬，每袋頭等粉至四十三萬，廿支本地出品蛛紗漲二八〇萬，每件高至三九八〇萬，黃金黑市猛漲。</p>
<p>〔本報鄭州十日電〕此間間鈔發行消息傳出後，金融市塲陡然紊亂，各業交易均在徘徊觀鑒，整日無成交。</p>
<p>〔本報現十日電〕現物價十日以大鈔間世因而上揚，但不如理想之劇烈，除紙煙上漲較高外，米每百斤一三五萬元，麵粉一無售者，造成此種現象之主要原因，仍係銀根頗緊，一般認為今後一週內之物值價可能大漲。</p>
<p>〔中央社曼谷十日電〕據最可靠消息：中國本年下半年由國際緊急糧食委會所分配之選米三千三百噸，可望於明年正月以前運抵上海，招商局海辰號輪，最近蔣駛抵此間，載運第一批選米返國。</p>
<h3>董顧光答記者問　行局緊縮業務端在遏止投機　物價穩定後貸款自即開放</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕關於滬市商會電呈中央，請令國家行局開放貸款及修正限制通匯辦法一事，行政院新聞局長　顯光十日在記者招待會席上答覆詢問稱：政府設置國家行局，原係扶助工商，便利人民，千餘年來，始終一貫，事實俱在，毋庸多加說明。至于最近奉命緊縮業務，原係因滬市投機猖獗，物價狂跳之臨時對策，且已見相當效果，一俟有若干時日之長期穩定，各行局自仍負起原有使命，　續辦理，深望工商業體念時艱，共同協力，制裁投機，根絕過去物價暴漲情事之重演；正當工商業是否能維持長期繁榮，胥視如何共同努力爲斷。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕戰前存款利利利息結算辦法，業經十日立院財經兩委會聯席會審查通過，將於會提出討論，聯席會中討論時，意見憂分兩派，一派認此事應及早解決，俾數載以來價權價務糾紛得以早日淸理，反對者則認若照自前計算方式，銀行未免過於便宜。最後多數認在此幣値不斷低落時期，即令倍數不大，亦以平日淸償爲宜。結果照案通過，惟原案所列國家行局爲配和國策，所放貸款，得以例外一點，則囚多數反對而删除。</p>
<h3>防止橋匯逃避　港澳國幫匯款　財部禁止收付</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕財部對僑匯逃港，早經密切注意設法補救。茲爲防止資金逃避，加强吸收僑匯起見，對於國內匯往香港及由港匯出之國幣匯款暨代交付國幣款項事宜，幷各地行莊接收港澳同業委託辦理收交業務，均經予以禁止。自本年八月間政府頒行外匯管理新辦法，准許僑會照市價結匯後，僑匯情形業已好轉，近政府幷正與香港當局洽商防止華南走私及經濟合作辦法，務使僑匯納人正軌，不致再有逃避現象。</p>

<h3>我赴日兵　人數問題未解決　麥帥僅充廿四人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國駐日憲兵隊已在整裝待發之中，一切準備均已就緒，惟因人數問題，麥帥總部僅允二十四人，我政府　派四十人，雙方洽商尙無結果，故迄今鄉未能成行。現自獨立第二營中選出之赴日憲兵四十人，每日仍受日語英語訓練，並不時有駐日代表團人員前往講演日本情形。彼等服裝均係全新配製，精神極佳。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十日電〕我出席聯合國安全理事會代表蔣廷　，自碧瑤返國後，因病在滬小駐數日，已於九日夜車來京，十日晨抵此九時許即赴外部與王部長及劉·葉兩次長悟談良久。十二時並共進午餐，下午六時晋見張　院長，並留與晚宴。蔣氏午後接見本報記者時談稱，渠對遠經會之結論爲：「前途不可預料，如做得好，可能有所成就」。渠並舉例罹，遠經委會之工作重心，在解決食糧。燃料之運輸。供應等緊急問題，戰後此等人民生活必需品因產地生產量减少，而消費地欠缺量增多，迄未得適當調劑。此種現象在遠東尤其嚴車，前度集會，各國均對此加以商討，但此次會議之初，即爲與會國家資格之爭論，佔去七日時間。荷印問題正由美。法。澳三國代表與爭執雙方磋商，求取解決。實則參加國際會議不一定必須先經承認其爲獨立國家，遠經會乃竟因印尼會寫問題而影響會議程序，實必要。蔣氏承認暹羅未參加此次會議對糧食問題之解決，不無影響，並暗示確切可能之計劃與足够之經費物資，將決定遠經委會之成敗。至對安理會之評論，渠謂：「就安理會爲處理有關和平問題一事言，余感覺大多數會員爲公正者，然如會員能更積極作戰設性之處理，少作祗顧法律維持現狀之處理，必可使安理會之貢獻更大」。蔣氏否認外電前傳：渠曾作我國主張對日和約簽訂後應使日本加入聯合會之聲明。渠日內將晋見蔣主席，預計三週後赴美返任。</p>
<h3>外部特派員即飛港　處理九龍城問題　葉公超在記者會上宣稱</h3>

<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕葉次長公超十日在行政院新聞局記者招待會，答覆記者詢問如下：</p>
<p>問，香港政府下令關逐九龍城之中國居民，中國政府將作何措置？</p>
<p>答，中國政府對此事正加以密切之注意，兩廣特派員郭德華現在京向王部長世杰述聯，已定乘最近班機返港，將與香港政府商治，以企能得一圓滿之解決。</p>
<p>問，聯合國倘請求中國派遠軍隊前往巴勒斯坦，　于維持聖地秩序，中國政府對此之態度如何？</p>
<p>答，中國政府以及聯合國中國代表團，對於派遣中國軍隊赴巴勒斯坦一事，並無所聞。</p>
<p>問，關於中國政府請求列爲對德和會邀請國之一，中國政府曾否自蘇聯政府接獲任何覆文？</p>
<p>答，迄今爲止，中國政府尚未接到蘇聯政府對此事之答覆。</p>
<p>〔合衆社香港十日電〕香港政府發言人十日稱：關於九能城迫選居民事，「尙未接獲中國方面之抗議」，然發言人承認，中國之抗議可能在南京英國大使館扣留中。渠稱：選移移令係根據一九三二年法令，規定除非港政麻將土地種出，他人不能居住，渠亦承認港府官員正「密切調査」該問顧之背境，以決定中國所稱具有宗主　之法律地位。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦的分治</h3>
<p>自聯合國全體大會於上月二十九日以三十三對十三票通過巴勒斯坦分治計　後，各地猶太人見到他們復國運動的成功，無不熟烈慶祝；而在巴勒斯坦人口中　有多數的阿刺伯人，及與阿刺伯人在宗敎信仰上是一致的其它地方，却不　　　憤激。就是在聯合國大會通過巴勒斯坦分治計　的常時，阿刺伯民族六國的代表即相率退出會塲，抗議多數「暗殺」聯合國憲章。同時，黎巴嫩總理又宣稱：「吾人正在待機而動，一俟時機到來，則向目標前進。一究竟所謂目標，所謂時機，所指的是什麼，由於晚近的發　，我們不　看出一個輪廓。到了最近，在巴勒斯坦方面，阿猶之問的衝突旣日益尖銳，就是準備做巴勒斯坦猶太邦的陸軍總司令也被人暗殺，流血事件正不斷地在進行　。而正在這個時候，我們旣看見阿刺伯聯盟的會議於開羅，英國駐巴勒斯坦的陸軍總司令又宣布英軍將於十二月十五日起撤離巴勒斯坦，到明年八月英國即將全部　離聖地，以備將匕勒斯坦移交給阿猶兩邦。目前，在巴勒斯坦的流備和　動，正方興未艾，適於此際，我們看見有邀請我國軍隊派駐聖地警衛的報道。準此而觀，可知巴勒斯坦局勢的如何發展，不特關係聯合國這一國際組織的成敗，和今後世界和平的確保，而且與我國今後在國際政治上的地位有關，我們不能不加以重視。</p>
<p>聯合國大會之通過巴勒斯坦分治計劃，原經過相當的考慮。在未通過此計劃前，旣會派遺調查團，前往聖地實地調查；而當此案提交大會的時候，美蘇的意見又未必一致。在蘇聯則首以扶助阿刺伯民族的姿態出現，因是而獲得阿刺伯各民族的好感；迨分治計劃提出，則又強為阿刺伯民族後援，表示不肯與美國意見相接近，以自高其地位。幾經折　，蘇聯乃表示不再堅持成見，於是美蘇一致，巴勒斯坦的分治計劃卒獲聯合國大會的通過。依照此計劃，聖地將於明年八月分成阿剌伯猶太兩邦，而聖地的聖地，即　路撒冷，則將在國際共管下，不屬於阿猶兩邦。由於此一議案的通過，三十年來所未曾解決的巴勒斯坦問題，在書面上總算得到了一個解決；但觀乎阿刺伯人民的堅決反對，不惜以流血來保持聖地的完整，可見巴勒斯坦問題，似乎不因聯合國大會議案的通過而解決，或更因此而引起新的枓紛。</p>
<p>我們首先得明瞭，巴勒斯坦之所以有問題，實是我們拜受了第一次世界大戰所賜的結果。這可以分兩方面來說：第一，在第一次世界大戰前，巴勒斯坦本是舊土耳其帝國的一部。在土耳其帝國下，巴勒斯坦原也可相安無事。第一次世界天戰的結果，使土耳其帝國瓦解，法國旣獲得了敍利亞和黎巴嫩；英國也獲得了伊拉克和巴勒斯坦；迨國際聯盟成立，英法兩國便在各該地獲得了所謂委任統治。憑了這國際聯盟的委任，英國在巴勒斯坦掌握了統治的大權到如今。第二，在第一次世界大戰的當時，巴勒斯坦旣爲土耳其帝國的一部，而土耳其帝國却是英國釣敵人；所以英國用盡種種方法，要想來分化士耳其帝國，這原是作戰中所不可或缺的一種策略。在這些分化土耳其帝國的許多計劃中，其中有一項就是促使猶太人返回猶太　國，著名的鮑爾　聲明，就明白表示了英國願意助猶太人的復國。須知猶太人在二千年來流離各地，甚至還到過我們中國，在開封的猶太人一直到淸末還保他他們的「一賜樂業』敎和寺院，而在他們的故地，猶太人的子孫幾乎已經絕滅，悉爲阿刺伯人所占。英國的支持　太人復國，原非　愛他們，乃是在拆土耳其帝國的台，道是一種作戰的　略，自甚明顯。但由於土耳其帝國在第一次世界大　後的瓦解，卻不能不使英國　　諾　來幫助猶太人的復國。今日在巴勒斯坦的猶太人，可以說大都是第一次世界戰爭結束後回去的。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦問題的歷史北京旣如此，我們認為聯大此次所通過的分治計劃，終覺　可遺憾。不用說，阿刺伯民族各國家　此無不表示滿，就是其它信奉伊斯　敎的民族，亦無不　激。聯合國　　倘因此面喪失了信奉回敎人民的信任，實在是很可惜的。至於此一　　的　過表示美蘇意見的接近，其結果却似乎恰恰相反，實母　說是蘇聯刁　外交的成功。蘇聯與巴勒斯坦在地理上比較接近。而在蘇聯南部又駐有子軍；一旦近東有事，便可以迅連出兵．它又暗中促使大量在東歐的猶太人返回猶太，它之所以接受分治計劃，　在惟恐巴勒斯坦　近東無事。如果近東一旦有事，它能够找到什麼籍口，便可以迅派大軍在地中海東岸立脚。在這種意義下，蘇聯接受了分治計劃，而　大也因爲有美蘇對此一案的支　，終於將分治計劃通過了。由於現有的種種跡象，巴勒斯坦恐將　此多事。美國對巴勒斯坦問題的沒有　見和堅定的政策，也實在令人太息。</p>
<p>至於邀請中國軍隊警衛聖地一事，我政府已加否認；吳令眞有其事，我政府似亦必加拒絕。在聯大通過巴勒斯坦分治計劃時，我國代表棄權，沒有投票。我國之不參加巴　斯　紛爭這一決策是明智的。我們所不解的是：巴勒斯坦問題旣主要是由於英國的政策而起，現在到了難以收拾的時候，英國却準備即速撤離。我們固深知英國目前所遭遇的困難，但也知英國是最重責任感的民族；如今求去心切，不也有逃避責任之嫌？「火中揀票」，這是美國民族的雅量；但在國際政治上，祇有雅最似乎還不够，還應該有政治家的遠見和堅定的政策，在巴勒斯坦問題上是如此，在別的問題上也如此。祇有這　，美國　能領導世界，世界和平纔能確保！</p>

<h3>美記者談新疆情況</h3>
<p>（上接一版）西北行轅主任張治中今　曾向記者聲稱，新疆西部之伊犂叛變，出於蘇聯指使。該說現由外國觀察家自伊犂返滬予以證實。伊犂叛黨擁有蘇聯訓練之軍隊五萬人，要求新疆獨立，另設所謂「東土耳其斯坦共和國」，並拒絕與巾國政府進行談判。漢族僅占全省人口百分之十，地處邊僻，除空路外，與本部交通無異斷絕。省會少數駐軍配備彈　均極有限，決非有蘇聯後盾之叛黨敵手。新疆一旦脫離中國，叛黨殆將在經濟與軍事上立即與蘇聯結合而淪爲其衛星國。內蒙雖亦要求自治，但對蘇聯則心存疑懼，且深知無法抵抗外蒙入侵。記者去　旅行內蒙，在距外　邊境六十哩處訪問某旗酋長杜爾貝王，承吿內蒙如獲自由，恐將車蹈外蒙覆轍。目前惟一選擇，　在外蒙與中國問兩書取其輕而已。內蒙人民備受貧困打擊，頭腦簡單，性情懦弱，外　軍隊經常騷擾，刧掠羊馬，但國府方忙於應付內戰，無暇旁顧，以致不能出兵保護，减輕其痛苦。若干地點外蒙入侵每月兩次之多，雖尙未與國軍發生衝突，但若一旦接觸，政府在內蒙亦無充份軍隊足資防禦。德王並稱：「本人與全體民衆均恐外蒙軍終將大舉來犯，永久佔領內蒙，深信外蒙之進　係奉蘇聯命令，否則不致出此。外蒙在蘇聯宋佔領前，人民傾向本與內蒙相同但經蘇聯　化，心腸現已改變，且習於兇暴矣」。</p>

<h3>國防部發表一週戰局</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕國防部新聞局長鄧文儀，十日在記者招待會發表一週（十二月三日至十日）戰局，茲錄誌於次：</p>
<p>大別山區剿匪形勢</p>
<p>這一週要特別說明的，是大別山區的剿匪形勢，國軍自從開始進剿以來，即先後克復立煌，羅田，英山，浠水，宣化店等地，最近又進駐大別山區要點的岳西以及麻城，光山，黃安間大別山麓各據點。並繼續向劉匪聚集物資的核心—經扶，黃安間的山地壓迫。同時，我　山，信陽方面的大軍，也向東南　進，於是劉匪在四面被攻之下，只好放棄原來建立大別山取根據地的夢想，將主力逐漸向西北移動，意在避免決戰，保持實力。據　日前綫報吿，劉匪的第十一縱隊，雖有一段　　向平漢鐵路的　林車站附近乘夜化整爲零，先後　　了七八千人，到路西的　家河附近，但被國軍予以包圍。匪軍中已有副團長一員攜械，率匪五百餘向國軍投　，另匪一千餘人亦在接洽投誠中。此外，在大廟畈，西雙河一帶，並俘匪一千四百餘人，傷斃一千一百餘人，該股匪軍兎脫不到二千人，至於被國軍截學於鐵路東三里城和金家灣一帶的匪軍約四五千人，已打成　段，奪路亂　，還有向固始逃竄約二縱隊殘部，是從立煌以西逃　我由立煌西進　軍之打擊，而退至該地的，亦在徬徨無守，由現在的形勢來看，國軍　　劉匪，粉碎他在大別山區立足的攻勢，已獲到第一步的成功。</p>
<p>豫皖邊區陳匪亡命豫皖邊區的陳毅匪部一，三，四，六等縱隊，自從南越隴海路以來，初敗於津浦路以西，繼被逐於黃汎區各縣，喘息的時間都沒有，到處奔逃，由豫北，豫東、皖西，豫南，天大亡命，現有一部還在淮陽周家口一帶，若南下與劉匪合股則必同歸於盡，若北返，又恐再受國軍包團打擊，還在　徊歧路，尤有繼續破懐　海鐵路的企圖。</p>
<p>魯西方面最近沒有戰鬥！陳毅匪因損失慘重，現又從黃河以北脅迫了二萬多十六七歲及五十多歲的老弱民兵，準備補充在來鄉外　失敗的殘部，足見匪在河北快要做到「壯丁　光」的程度。</p>
<p>膠東陜南匪均失敗</p>
<p>膠東方面，以海陽金口南阡三地的戰鬥比較激烈，當地的國軍雖然不多，但是極爲英勇，匪軍人數合共三萬多人，由於戰鬥力薄弱，和匪首指揮技術的拙劣，徒驅使一兩萬的無辜民衆作砲灰，結果仍歸失敗。</p>
<p>陝南孔從周匪部，現在　氏漫川關開地區，陳　匪的四縱隊，一部和火縱隊主力仍盤踞於魯山南台方城各地帶，最近會一度與民團激戰於西峽口附近，昨日所得消息，匪被國軍與民團反包圍，當塲被擊斃三千多人，並繳可槍一千四百多支。據俘供稱，孔匪已被團在內，其四縱隊主力則潛伏於內鄉北方伏牛山山區。總觀陳賡匪部自渡黃河南竄後，雖自稱已建立了兩個游擊據點，但在政治上是失敗的，因爲民衆已看穿了他那些奸詐欺騙的技倆，並已發生　劣的反感，英勇的反抗，由此可以預測共匪總反攻的前途是沒有多大希望的。</p>
<p>本週戰果　備極豐盈</p>
<p>截至十日午前為止，繼續所得前綫消息，總結本週戰果，國軍在大別山區已將劉　伯承主力擊潰，共恢復豫鄂邊重要城鎭十一處，九日又進入經扶，此外黃安第六縱隊的匪，亦自西北敗逃，根據不完全的統計，在　田以西山區搜獲匪埋在地下之小小小砲六門，在宣化店經扶及柳河西雙河各地，　獲匪軍物資武器，堆積如山，其中　爲三百餘匹，匪軍被傷斃者已有七千多人，俘　三千四百多人，內匪廿八旅之八十一團　長一名，和政治指導員十四人，姓名正査訊中。又在固始商城間的上石橋俘匪七百八十人，傷斃匪四百人，在武勝　　路西的東　店，還包　匪兩　約四千人，不久亦可　滅。</p>

<h3>法蘇關係不絕如縷　法拒絕蘇抗議退回照會　蘇僑有參加罷工嫌疑已被逐出法境</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：巴黎訊，法辦關係因法政府拒絕接受蘇方之照會而更趨緊張。法外交部證言人認爲，照會內所提條件，不能接受，內容根據亦屬不確。法總工會已下令停止罷工，目下除一百萬工人尙未復工外，餘均開始工作，政府地位因此已見增張，但仍有若千重大政治經濟問題未獲解決。惟政府對蘇聯立塲，頗爲堅定。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十日電〕蘇聯中止法蘇經濟談判，並將駐蘇法遣散團人員驅逐出境，法政府十日拒絕接受蘇聯關係此二事之照會。法內閣擧行全體會議，許曼總理提出動議。經各部一致同意，訓令法駐蘇代辦夏邦蒂將蘇聯照會送回蘇外部，並解　稱法政府不能加以接受。內閣發言人稱：「照會在法政府接獲前，其內容已公開發表，而其條件亦足使吾人拒予接受」。十日晨各方面發展，似表示法蘇有繼絕邦交之可能。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎九日電〕蘇法貿易談判中斷後，法政府則於九日下令，驅逐蘇聯駐法　僑代表團出境，該團已於九日晚經由斯特拉斯堡搭火車離開法國境界。事後據外部發言人稱，法政府之決定驅遂蘇遺僑團，係因團內若干人員從事危害法國安全之秘密活動，與目前法國境內之工潮及暴動有關，但並非即為間　活動。</p>
<p>蘇遺僑團團長斐拉托夫上校，即爲與前述秘密活動有關係者之一。另悉被逐出境之蘇遣僑團共十二人，此外尙有蘇聯公民二十人，被控從事偵察法法國家利益之活動，業被法當局逮捕，將予押解出境。據蘇大使館方面透露消息，被捕者之中有蘇聯大使館職員一人，惟其姓名官階，尙不能獲知，蘇代辦九日下午，曾訪外交部，正式抗議逮捕蘇聯公民之事，惟闡於驅逐遣僑圈時，蘇使館官員均拒經發表意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十日電〕法國在過去三星期中，法國共驅逐蘇人卅五名出境，足以反映法蘇間緊張之關係。雖法國方面認爲法蘇絕交之可能性不大，駐巴黎蘇聯人士則報吿稱：彼等相信法國堅決之擧措，足以造成絕交。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕據倫敦消息，外交界承認此種發展，與四外長會議中法國外交政策有關，法外長皮杜爾在會議中益加與英美一致。</p>
<h3>總工會發出復工令後　法工人大部復工　北部礦區工人拒絕投降</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕法全國總工會於九日頒令於十日復工後，今晨八時起，一百萬罷工之工人，包括礦工·碼頭工人·鋼鐵工人，運輸鐵路工人等，自巴黎至馬賽，自勒哈佛至里昂，均傳來復工之報吿。各右翼及中間報紙，皆認罷工之結束，爲共產主義之重大挫敗。全國總工會共產系領袖弗朗雄，則在共黨機關報人道報發表談話，聲言勞工之堅忍不屈，已迫使政府讓步。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十日電〕法國復工命令除在北部礦區外，大體上工人均予以遵從。北部數礦塲糾察，仍企圖阻止復工工人復工。佔據礦塲之罷工工人，亦拒絕投降或自行工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十日電〕法總工會昨夜發表長達二千字之聲明，籲請各工會團結力量，準備重新奮鬥。據稱多數工人爲飢餓所迫，已忍痛恢復工作。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十日電〕政治家認許曼足以消弭罷工風潮稱：渠無疑業已將戴高樂之恢復政權，又歷數月之久，法政府此項命令之出現，恰為蘇聯通吿與法停止貿易談判數小時之後。按此次談判，目的係在爲法國獲得急切需要之三十萬噸榖物，雖則在蘇聯行動與法總工會之命令間，無何種相互關係，然此事足示許曼內閣與蘇聯間之裂痕更趨廣闊，又更進一步矣。</p>
<h3>義政府接受要求　總罷工可免　改組內閣談判將吿成</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：羅馬訊，義政府今日決定撥款一百○三億五千萬里拉（一千七百五十九萬五千美元）作爲羅馬發展公用事業計劃之用，因此已接受共黨主要要求之一。按共黨預定於午夜在　馬開始總罷工。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十日電〕總理加斯貝利今日在與社會，共和及工黨領袖會　結束後宣稱，吾人討論歷時已久，即將到達終點，深　擴大政府基　與容納左翼溫和派之企圖，今日可吿完成。按今日爲工會要求政府答復之最後限期，期前如無答復．羅馬與全省明日將開始實行總罷工。</p>
<h3>英蘇談判　已獲協議　威爾遜即返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：英政府某高級人士稱，渠相信英蘇貿易談判業已獲致協定，英貿易大臣威爾遜定今日自莫斯科返團，當不致空手歸來。但談判詳情迄今尙未宣佈。</p>
<h3>德境蘇佔領區情形　英美促蘇提報吿　四强對德進出口計劃獲致協議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：英美方面認爲除非蘇聯提供有關德境蘇佔區內情形之報吿，此次外長會議將不能就德國問題獲致任何基本協議。馬歇爾與貝文已聯合向莫洛托夫提出此項要求，莫氏之答覆甚爲圓滑，聲稱目前所討論之問題如能獲致協議，則蘇聯極願提供此項情報，而馬歇爾與貝文則堅持必須先行提供報告。根據種種跡象觀之，馬歇爾似已頗感不耐，而準備結束此次會議，良以馬氏目下正處理最棘手之事務，其結果如何，對馬歇爾計劃以及法義等國均有重大關係，不能任其延宕也。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕外長會議九日對論德國之經濟原則，通過英國之建議，決定起草整個德國之進出口計劃。嗣又討論英國文件中關於共同利用各佔領區資源之一章，該章建議廢止區圓壁壘，便利物資之自由流動，以及利用各區資源供整個德國之用。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫接受此一建議，但堅持須將蘇聯文件中建議之設立德國中央機構，作爲共同利用各區資源之先決條件。馬歇爾亦表示接受英國之建議，但皮杜爾則表示不能接受。馬歇爾當建議有不能協議者即常暫予擱置。進行討論下一事項，然後將文件交外長代表重新起草此議當被接受。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十日電〕美國官員今日私下聲稱，蘇聯要求德國賠償一百億美元，或將成爲促使四國外長會議破裂之一大問題。深信蘇聯代表莫洛托夫在未獲得保證至少切實滿足其賠償要求以前，不擬同意德國經濟統一。外長會議定於今日午後討論賠償事宜，但英美兩國迄今堅決反對此項要求，在目前局勢下，外長會觀自雞望有重要協議。</p>
<h3>南總理訪問羅京　訂互助公約　保內閣辭職改組</h3>

<p>〔聯合社保京十日電〕政界人士今日聲稱，總理狄米特洛夫在國會一致通過新憲法後，昨夜雖已率領閣僚提出辭呈，但渠或將立即組織新閣，以符合新憲法之規定。</p>
<h3>緊急對外援助法案　美衆院將予削减　聞該款項總數將减為五億美元</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十日電〕衆院共和黨領袖哈劾克今日宣稱，深信五億九千萬美元對外臨時援助經費，在今夜或明日表決以前，尙將再度切實削减，但確數如何則未說明。同時，衆院共和黨各領袖，聞已非正式同意削减該款爲五億美元。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕五億九千萬元對中，法，義，奧臨時援助案，決可於十日在衆院內舉行最後表決。該案原可於九日即行交付最後表決，後以修正案之辯論，耗去時間不少，遂不得不延長辯論。修正案之一建議於肥料缺乏最重時，减少供給歐洲之肥料，於週一費時一小時，週二復費時兩小時，始以一三五對一○七票被否決</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕衆院今日並以口頭表決，通過若干修正案，以防因援外物資之採辦，而引起國內物價之上漲。其中一款，禁止抬價在美國市場搜購援外物資，另一款建議由總統頒佈援辦物資辦法，以防存貨陷於祐竭。另一要求受援國家，提存等於援助物資美元價値之本國貨幣之修正案經衆院否決。</p>
<h3>美國可能實施　物品定量配給</h3>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕美政府已於十日向國會提出立法草案，建　對肉類，汽油及其他物品之定量配給。據商務部次長虛斯特稱，必要時政府得實施定量配給，以防物價脫糧。</p>

<h3>邱翁赴摩洛哥度假</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫數十日電〕邱吉爾今日離倫敦赴巴黎，轉往麼洛哥之馬拉凱許渡耶誕假期。</p>
<h3>蘇聯正訓練特別人才　推行反帝國主義政策　馬倫柯夫演辭今始發表</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕莫斯科電台稱：蘇聯內閣副主席馬倫柯夫於九月底，偕日丹諾夫赴華沙參加國際共黨會議時，向波蘭共黨組織局發表演說，聲言蘇共黨正在訓練代表，以促進其在國外之外交政策。此一演說頃始經眞理報發表。據馬氏云，蘇聯共黨現特別注意對外政策，及訓練特別人才，俾使蘇共對外政策得由此等人員切實施行。此等人員應知如何維護社會主義國家在國際中之地位及利益，如何區別友人與敵人，如何破獲帝國主義者及其問諜之陰謀。各國共黨須保持密切聯擊，否則即無從調和其行動以抗帝國主義之計劃。今美國正在組織反共產及反民主之運動，以反對蘇聯及其他新民主國，藉援助為名，企岡奴役歐洲，共鐵必須明確規定其對於美國此等計劃之態度。</p>

<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖九日電〕聯合國安理會今日將巴勒斯坦問題列入議程。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十日電〕安理會今日開會，討論本屆會議議程，美代表詹森反對於目前討論巴勒斯坦問題，渠認由於該處之發展，目前即予討論殊屬不智。叙利亞代表柯里立即表示反對，指出安理會負有執行分治之唯一責任，自當充分討論分治所引起之一切問題。聯大並非世界政府，無分裂國家建立政府之權，而安理會亦不過爲執行聯大決議之機構，渠主張由安理會立即辯論此整個問題，並准許埃及黎巴嫰之參加辯論。最後安理會決定延期討論巴勒斯坦問題，並通過准許埃及黎巴嫩參加討論。</p>

<p>上項消息，記者昨曾走訪市府有關負責人予以證實。據悉：吳市長為此，甚表煩惱，各局局長亦甚焦慮。例如公用局若從十科　減肥至六科，勢將無法工作。在收復區授職有效期間，雖吳市長仍有權任用新編制之額外人員，但彼等無法送審，未能受到中央　　，則明年行憲時，繼續任用即有困難。故市府方面，決在萬難之中，稍行核減，若有不能遵行之處，將再呈行政院複核，並請求派員來滬實地調査。詳細辦法，決提明日市政會議中討論之。</p>

<h3>人鬼雜居　寄柩凌亂　潮惠山莊一幅難民圖</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕房荒聲中，本市近來運續發生殯舍被各地流亡難民佔住的新聞。到目前爲止，據說已有潮惠山莊等入個單位受到影響。在這所謂現代化的大都市裏，演出這存亡爭住的一幕，是文明的諷刺？是大時代的悲劇？實在使人感到茫然若失！據潮惠山莊的負責人吿訴記者：山莊被佔住，還不過是最近一二期來的事，來住的時候，紀律很不好，都是晚上　牆打開門進來的。而且根本也沒徵得同意，就　夜把殯舍裏寄存的　柩，一口口的自動抬開去，騰出來的空房子就佔下了。</p>
<p>據他調査，這批自稱爲流亡難民的，一　起有二千多人，而照他所知道的，眞正是戰區流亡來此的，不過二三百人。其餘的大多是山莊附近的破落人家，或是找不到住所的戶頭，所以這佔住的一羣中形形色色的人物都有，什麽攤販，皮鞋匠，洋車夫，三輪車夫，居然也有在裏面開起店的，更有穿着華麗，戴了首飾，三輪車進出的時　女郎，當然赤貧的眞正難胞，也多的是！</p>
<h3>一幅悲慘畫面</h3>
<p>記者昨天偸得半日閒，上山莊實地瀏覽一番。覺得這幅存亡爭住的畫面，　够悲慘了·　舍十間九間，都被佔住。原先歇在殯舍裏的靈柩，大多被佔住的擅自抬出，零零落落的堆置在破了頂沒門窗的殯舍裏。有的堆不下了，就暴露在外邊，任令風吹雨打。若干棺木在搬動時受了損傷，更有棺蓋和棺身　呈將耍脫離關係的。有幾間殯舍裏，一家老小，乾脆就跟棺木貼鄰而臥。炊具行灶隨處布置。也有幾間殯舍，稍有傢具陳設，佈置尙不甚壞，橫榻上正對躺着一男一女，衣飾相當體面，正在那裹悠閒地聊天</p>
<h3>應防患於未然</h3>
<p>聽說潮惠山莊負責方面，已推代表向吳市長請示解決辦法，吳市長已允着工務局儘可能於本月廿日以前，　地趕搭大批棚舍，再設法容納這批難胞。</p>
<p>流亡難胞處境的艱困，是可同情的。他們遭受戰亂的蹂躪，背鄉離井，投奔這大都市來，而且愈集愈多，食衣住，那校樣不成問題，而殘酷的嚴冬又在跟前。在這像是安寗的社會背面，似乎正蘊藏著一顆　，而這癌如不及時予以合理解決，隨時隨地都可以化　潰爛，其影響將及於一般社會。要防止這癌的化膿和潰爛，這是市政當局以及處境較優的上中層社會，慈善家，共同的責任。</p>
<p>願進一言</p>
<p>誰無祖先，誰無父　，記者最後願為難胞進一言，佔住殯舍是一事，而在未取得同意前，任意搬動棺柩，或甚致損毁殯舍設備，而損毁了寄舍的棺柩，無疑的，流亡難民也將失去社會的同情的•求生存是人人本能的慾望，但我們要在不侵害他人自由的條件下求生存，更不容他人假借難民的名　，作利已損人的搶生存！</p>
<h3>公共交通公司　通車二週年　盛大慶祝會　市長檢閱行列頌發獎章</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨爲本市公共交通公司公共汽車通車二週年紀念，晨八時半，假東大名路九五九號該公司廣塲上舉行盛大慶祝會。到吳國楨，王曉籟，趙祖康，張師等二十餘人。由趙曾珏主席。大會開始，該公司全體職員五百餘人，穿着制服，列隊塲側，吳市長等　塲檢閱一週後，首由趙局長報吿公共交通公司業務概况略稱：</p>
<p>補充南北交通</p>
<p>本市公共汽車行駛兩年來，可分做二個時期，第一年是草創時期，第二年是充實時期。行車路綫網之布置，已打破前租界時期之分割現象。上海都市之發展，乃由東向西，以前交通路綫之發展，即以東西向者爲多。本曾行車之將綫，乃力求補南北交通綫之不足。</p>
<p>解決行的的問題</p>
<p>現時本會共有二三三輛車輛，已較去年增加百分之九十二。乘客人數亦較去年增百分之九十，據十月份統計，爲七百七十七萬餘人，全部票價收入達一百八十億。本會車輛，係採用道奇F二三四型卡車改裝，車身先用木質，本年起採用鉛皮，並放低車架及接長底　。此後業務，當儘量增添車輛，以解決民衆「行」的問題。</p>
<p>合作共渡難關</p>
<p>繼由吳市長發表三點感想略稱：　中國人有個最壞的習氣，即喜擺官架子，例如郵局。銀行等職員，即曾予民衆極惡劣之印象，而希望各位待人須謙遜和善。　愛惜公物，公家的一紙一物，均應視如自己所有。　公共汽車公司職工，前曾因待遇問題而鬧罷工，實深遺憾，希望今後無此情形。目前國家處境困難，望谷位只求工作勤勞，不問待遇多少，俾能彼此合作，共渡難關。</p>
<p>頒發兩種獎章</p>
<p>後由王曉　致詞，對該會工作成績表示滿意，並預祝明年今天，能更使全市市民感到到到行的便利。末由吳市長頒發獎章，分服務與安全兩種，服務獎章爲該會職員一年內未請假者，得獎者共一八二人，由宣泰林代表接獎。安全獎章爲該會司機一年內未　事者，得獎者共七九人，由邢鴻觀代表接獎。大會於會歌聲中閉幕，下午並有遊藝電影等餘興節目慶祝。</p>

<h3>服毒後圖殺姘婦地檢處提起公訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕何恒生與揚州人陳彩弟姘識，近悉陳女別有所歡，頓萌殺意，購石碱一萬元，又買剪刀一柄，擬將陳女殺死後，自己亦服石　自殺。本月二日何乘陳女熟睡之際，潛行起身，先將石堿用水溶化吞服，後即以剪刀猛向陳女頸中　下。陳受傷痛極呼救，何亦毒發倒地。經鄰人　聲趕至，車送四明醫院急救。該案由警局移送地檢處偵査，經陳　陶檢察官偵査終結，認爲何有殺人未遂罪　，昨日提起公訴。</p>
<h3>樂隊領班被控　偽造文書罪嫌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舞　中有名之中華大東隊領班陳　，被控偽造文書案，經地檢處提起公訴後，該案昨移地院弄庭辦理。承辦該案之曹祖慰推事定十六日開庭審訊。　陳於去年七月對黃剛稱，　有洋酒一千二百瓶，擬予出售，每瓶價美金一元。黃信爲眞，即付美金一千二百元，定購該酒。惟陳之洋酒迄未交出。延宕至本年二月，黃向索還款項，陳開出友邦銀行法幣一億六千八百萬元支票一紙，屆時因存款不足退票。繼由萬國儲蓄會經理史畢門出面調解，開出大陸銀行法幣四億五千萬元支票一紙，又　退票。黃剛至此認爲陳故意詐欺，遂向地檢處控陳有「僞造文書」罪嫌。</p>
<h3>農林部派員來滬　調處魚市糾紛　漁管處大量傾銷　民營業無法維持</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總漁管處救濟漁輪捕撈之魚貨，因滯銷發生糾紛之情形，已迭誌本報。據悉：此事之　因，係在一月前，各民營漁業公司以行總漁輪設備新穎，捕撈迅速，到貨踴躍，致魚價慘跌，故曾要求行總漁管處减少卸貨數額，而漁管處因出貨數量在技術上無法使之縮減，且除上海外，其他地方之銷路亦無法推展，故表示不願接受。</p>
<p>嗣各民營漁業公司以　累日甚，又向漁管處提出談判，數經商討，決定自十一月份起，漁管處之漁輪卸貨′，以每月不超過三十五萬斤爲原則。據漁管處方面表示：若照此限額出貨，每月祇需漁輪六七艘即可充分供應，其餘漁輪如留泊復興島無法卸貨，則經常冷藏費用將不勝負祖。至日前傳說之紛擾，聞因民營漁業公司到貨過多，故漁市塲取得漁管處同意，將行總漁輸暫停卸出，惟截至昨晚止，所有行總在漁市塲之魚貨，業經完全卸淸，外傳種咱及行總魚貨有腐爛之說，並非不實，蓋行　漁輸上之新式冷　設備，可保存魚鮮至兩年以上不致腐爛也。據各民營公司方面稱：渠等每次出海捕魚，每船需費三億元左右，漁管處若無限制傾銷，影響魚價下潟，彼等將無法維持，故亟希農林部能迅與行總洽妥，使產銷狀况合理，俾一方面民營漁業公司得以生存，另一面亦不致影響民食。</p>

<h3>七商人被捕　米市一度停頓　洽商後恢復</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市警局昨奉令整日出動經濟警察大隊，監視各市塲交易。一般情形尙屬良好。其間南米市塲曾因逮捕不法抬價米商陳梅章（源昌），張元逸（泰山），李伯象（永春），楊寶豐（長豐泰）。李永源（天泰德），朱桂卿（朱桂記）等七人，一度停市。後經市塲負責人與警局洽商，願遵令依照不超過每石八十萬元之價繼續開做，警局始允將七人釋放。同時七米店即將買進之四百七十五石白米依限價全部售出。此外油市塲晨開時因榨油廠停止出售，人心不安。經油業公會理事長張超商請榨油廠平價直接配售零售商食油三千担供應門市後，始吿穩定。</p>
<h3>引水管轄權　決提前接管　海關罷工引水員　將重行甄別任用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市引水權管轄問題，自海關外籍引水發生罷工糾紛，銅沙公會華籍引水要求海關將原定明年一月一日交出之管轄權提早移交與航政局後，交通部即與財政部洽商。經財部關務署開會討諭結果，已決定提早交出。本市航政局昨日接奉交部電令指示三點：　引水管轄權財政部已允由航政局提前接管，交替日期由航政局與海關接洽後決定。　罷工之海關引水二十二人如願恢復工作者，由航政局個別甄審後作爲新人任用。　海關臨時　用之白俄引水留用至年底爲止。</p>
<h3>外籍引水　須入公會</h3>

<h3>台灣爭取平等待遇</h3>
<p>記者昨訪台省郵區男女代表，台省復員迄今仍延用日本佔領期間之郵電合設制，現有郵電員工七千餘人，在日人殖民地政策下台胞員工不准組織工會，待遇極低，且均充任中級以下職務。目前在台灣物價狀况下，所入不足個人溫飽，故郵工頗多利用公餘從事拉人力車，賣香姻等副業。因此台籍代表此來最目要之任務，是爭取平等待遇，要求「改班」，舉行甄別考試，按國內制度分等級錄用支薪。台籍郵工之困苦，在大會中已得普遍同情。代表張美王小姐對記者稱：初次回到祖國，像回到爸媽的懐抱，國內兄弟姊妹們待我們太好了。</p>

<h3>福州市政浮雕</h3>
<p>〔本報福州六日訊〕福州是南中國的一個港口，就經濟地理馬點而言，福州殆已成為　江沿岸富庶的十餘縣份貨物的吐納　。輸入向以棉布·麺粉·米級爲大宗，紙似·棉紗·肥田粉·植物油等次之，豆餅·五金·電器。豆類又次之。輸出以茶·木·紙為大宗，糖·筍·菰。鮮乾果次之，紙傘·漆器·角梳·魚介海味又次之。輸入多為農產品與都市日用品，輸出以特產為　幹。戰時而至戰後，據　海關報吿，幾乎都在貿易　差狀態中，雖然今年六七月一度出超，但貿易情况並不扭　。</p>
<p>港口貿易</p>
<p>福州貿易之趨向繁榮，殊有賴於港口交通之暢達。福建至今仍無伸向內陸之　道綫，這是福州港消胃太弱的一個主要原因。其次，閩江河這缺乏適時的疏　與拔振治，殊　航運之暢。閩江自南平至水口一段，礁　　比，險　竟達二十餘處之多。下　則沙泥淤塞，河訂日高，戰前數千噸巨舶，可直指台江市區，如今以水淺彼阻於馬尾驟星塔，貨物改用　船上下裝卸，比下工　奇昂，似此　運徒足以增加進出口物資的成本。　榮福州，首須改善目前港口交通窒息的現狀。興築閩贛鐵路，交通部已在策劃中，疏濬　江下游水道，賓為當務之急，聞省常局已在　款向洽購　泥機，建立新式碼頭與倉庫等等，凡此皆為繁榮福州商港的要政，亦足以影　於福州經濟的枯榮。總理在　業計劃中，以福州建為二等港，整治閩江下游水　，使達卅英尺的深度，以便萬噸巨輸可以暢通無阻，足以　知福州港的價値。</p>
<p>工商農業</p>
<p>福州工業，仍處在手工業的階段裏，可分為特產加工與技　作品兩大部門：前者如鋸木·碾米·造紙·揀茶，後者如漆器·紙傘·角梳·雕刻及民生日用品織布·皮革等，重工業則僅有福電鐵工廠一家。　閩西北特產運銷是構成福州商衆重要的一環。戰前萬商　集，景况頗盛，戰後時產因運銷困阻，工價步漲，成本陡增，　以時局動盪，銷路呆滯，致市面金融緊　，高利貸風行，如素以經營特產之福建農林公司以外銷不易，營業　殆，可見一斑。</p>
<p>論及農產，福州市區僅有耕地三，○○○市畝，農作物產量甚微，全市人口卅三萬餘，日需食糧二千餘石，泰多仰賴外埠輸入，據官方報吿去年度輸入稻　二六萬四〇〇○市石，米五二萬八○○○市石，麥粉四萬八○○○市擔，福州幾乎不能一日沒有外　接濟。</p>
<p>公用事業</p>
<p>電氣是福州最大的公用事業，福州電氣公司計有發電機四座，容量不及五·○○〇瓩，電氣公司機件因已屆逾　時期，時吿損懐，白天不能供電，晚上亦時常分區停電。福州至今仍無自來水設備，市民　井而　，每　春夏　雨時期，洪水為災。溝水倒灌，井水為之渾濁，因而，每　必疫　述流行，「水」是福州市政工程大問題。華僑經建公司前有投資創辦福州自來水廠之擬議。惟需款過鉅，此事自亦有待。治標之　在乎飲水消毒，市府會總行總合辦飮水消　供應站七處，現已有一處完成，以新式　水機　淸市民用水。</p>
<p>福州市區交通，以公共汽車為主，全市僅有卅輛，分三路行駛，車輛殊不敷分配，南僑經建公司接辦福州公共汽車後，聞有擴充之準備，以疏暢　　之　區交通。</p>
<p>市政難題</p>
<p>財政問題，究其實即是經濟問題。戰後福州工商凋敝，經濟情况逈非昔比。在此種不景氣情況之下，市府稅收雖迭經整理，仍米有起色。財政　据，難爲無米之炊，抱殘守缺，談何鼎革？</p>
<p>糧食，是市府最難應付的一個課題。福州是一個完全消費有地方，米　全賴閩北或海外接濟，市府沒有偌大的財力向產區採購大批糧食供給平價市塲，而糧商倒有雄厚的資力　　糧價與市府　法。季節性的糧價　動，給市政當局猶如一塲「惡性　疾」在糾　。市長嚴靈峯是一個有魄力有自信心的市政工作者，常他與記者暢論福州一般市政問題時，他總以樂觀的情調展望福州市政前途，　氏態度誠　而謙冲，具有對鄉梓服務的一片赤誠，於地方與情，融治無間。</p>
<p>福州是一個很有作為的都市，她有作為交通動　的閩江，和煦的氣候，天然的良港，普及的敎育，假使交通情况可以逐步改善，則　　可期，而重振其在華南的商業地位，這是市政當局的責任，有待於市政常局的不斷努力。（本報特派記者陳正予）</p>

<h3>敎部社敎司英千里司長　談敎育電影計劃　本年製片廿二種用以改進邊疆社敎</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕敎部社敎司英千皇司長，十日對記者談中　敎育電影製片廠今後計劃稱：（甲）建築：擬擴充辦公室，技術室，並修建聯員宿舍，以利工作，（乙）設備！　修建內景塲，改善錄音洗印設備，裝置水電電器材，在美已購者，計有　最新出品　優良之十六毫米攝影機，此機在國內尙未見到，即在美各廠家亦未多應用，全部設備及附件俱全。　錄音全部設備，亦為美最新並最完善之出品，所有零件均備。　在美購有洗印設備。為自動式，並有感光試驗設備，（以　定攝製洗印之科學標準），另有感光材料。以上設備及器材，一部已到滬，大部亦啓運在途。</p>
<p>十六毫米影片</p>
<p>（丙）將來攝製：擬着重攝製十六毫米影片，因目前趨勢，用十六奄米攝映機者，多於用卅五毫米攝映機，將來尤甚，而攝製十六毫米之機件，亦較卅五毫米輕便，且十六毫米不易燒着，推行較易，卅五毫米片，自身根本爲一火藥，危險性大，過去十六毫米片推行不　，係因出品較劣，技術尙未臻完善，現經各廠家互改良，十六毫米片攝映機重量，僅有二十磅，光源可達一千瓦特，音銀亦可達十瓦特，今後出品標準，着重普及於各級學校及民衆團體，所攝片型亦以十六毫米爲主，以卅五毫米對象爲各影院，每年只可出較有價値者一部。又擬組織有力編劇部門，每年爲其他各廠家寫作有意義劇本，以濟國內廠家攝製稿本荒。此外擬大量攝製靜片，包括靜捲片及靜單片，以便達到全國所有國民學校及農民，得以提高知識水準，靜片之手法，頗類似連環圖畫，同時每出品一部，並出連環圖一册，用作民衆　物。</p>
<p>題材分為三部</p>
<p>（丁）關於攝製題材，可分爲三部：　課外敎育，包括國內現狀，世界大局，　配合各課各級敎　題材，。普遍宣傳報導及戲劇，該廠雖有數年歷史，但在抗戰期間，限於設備，製片技術自　幼稚，而對敎育事業之認識與連繫，亦題離理想尙遠。現旣東遷來京，力求充　改善，今後尙希望新聞界對該廠多予指導，尤盼學術界敎育界多多合作。至於各事業機關，如願與該廠共同攝製有關影片，尤屬竭誠歡迎。至該廠本年最大工作，爲改進邊疆社會敎育，改製原有敎育影片十種，連特製十二種，計廿二種，供邊疆應用，內容包括我國的「史地」，「工業」，「交通」，「國防」等，並以國語配合維文蒙文藏文，加以配音，以便邊民識認。</p>

<h3>汽十六的　第一個印象　作風樸實無華</h3>
<p>〔本報特稿〕輜汽十六　籃球隊抵滬第一戰，便創造了一個奇蹟：在始終居於下風的局面，倖勝仁餘。</p>
<p>客隊除了借用「征輸」的于瑞章和劉政軍，出場祗：王士選，賈志軍，鄭大光，　滌航，甘容武五人。够得上全材之稱的，祇有賈志軍一人，鄭大光有可驚異的速度和快出手，王士選所憑的僅是經驗。</p>
<p>仁餘多射籃人材，兼以動作花巧，玩弄對方，客隊初時竟致不知所措。汽十六戰術樸實無華，傳球技術也遠不如主隊，上半時多被仁餘截刧得去。</p>
<p>客隊所以反敗為勝的理由，祇有兩點：下半時仁餘無人看管賈志軍的進攻，仁餘長力不如客軍。孫國政罰出，局面遂由仁餘控制而變爲平均，客隊乘機利用快出手，搶造勝利。</p>
<p>今後的幾塲比賽，倘無特殊的原因，照我個人意料，汽十六尙須努力。（昌年）</p>

<h3>大鈔發行以後　銀根抽緊防範嚴密　物價波動甚微　金融界表示須注意農曆年關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行昨發行萬元以上大鈔一千元二千元關金，市况至爲平穩，證券及若干物品價格且告下跌。央行副總裁劉攻芸氏昨午招待記者發表談話稱：大鈔發行，物價並無波動，金融管理局今起正式成立，決切實嚴加檢查打擊投機。國家行局並抽緊銀根，昨差進達1千餘億，今日即貨物稅1項復將差入四百億元。食米四萬三千噸與大最麵粉最近即將陸續到埠，巨額各種物資均即分別配售。此外並限制匯款，四聯總處並暫行完全停止貸款，故金融及物價前途堪告無無虞云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕一千及二千關金券昨日發行後，晨間因人心浮動，物價激漲，市塲稍見混亂，但尋即回降，離開前日之物價不遠。以股票市塲而言，開盤即見高峯，永紗塲外至四四〇，塲內亦至四二七，但空頭乘高拋出，致售價大挫，至正午收盤時，已降至四百關口。外匯市塲晨間亦有波動，但至中午時，已與前日相去極微。</p>
<p>物價曲綫向上防範不可稱懈</p>
<p>據金融界人士之分析，大鈔發行後物價之所以未作大波動者，由於政府各方面之防範極嚴，於抽緊銀根之外，復嚴厲監視囤積，同時，目前大鈔發行之數量甚少，故其影響尚不太顯著。但我人須注意者，即物價之曲錢始終向上走，一切措施僅有延遲之作用，預料此兩種新關金票之大量發行，不在今日而在農暦年關左右，以應付年賞及其他需要，屆時如無適常之防範，物價將呈激變，而大鈔之全部影響，其時方能予以估計。又昨日各種物價之上漲成數，因一切尚在動盪狀態中，且各種商品並不一律，難有準確之衡量，一般認爲須兩三日後，一切重呈穩定之局面，方能加以估計.</p>
<p>國行召集會議停付各種貨欵</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行劉副總裁，昨晨因鑒於大額券發行伊始，對國家行局業務，當應作緊急措置，故特召集各行局負責人，舉行臨時會議，討論一過，當決定：　對一切不應支付之款項，暫停支付。　貸款全部停止，即棉花麵粉等重要貸款，亦均暫時停放．　各公家機關及國營事業存款在兩億元以上者，　限每日最多支付二億。　各地匯款在兩億元以上者，亦暫不支付，並將查明匯款來源。聞該項決定，純係爲配合政府政策，俾抽緊銀根，以平穩物價云。</p>
<h3>統債上升外股略回</h3>
<p>公倘昨新買隨大鈔刺激而紛來，統丙晨開二五七〇〇元，自二五二五〇元，步升至二八〇〇〇元左右而後稍盤。甲乙自一七〇〇〇元升至一八五〇〇元而後亦定。較前收計甲乙升一千九，丙漲二千三，丁升一千七，戊種亦好一千六。</p>
<p>外股備後略回，港　跌，及業外黑市高後急回，買方活躍後，終遭存多迫低。怡紗晨開時會見四〇萬外，英聯五五萬外高　，後回低至三八五〇〇〇元而復盤，較前收計電話電車尚平，橡皮股跌一成，會德豐怡啤紙版航業鋼業各跌半成，怡紗英聯微降，祥泰稍升。</p>
<p>六種公債昨日抽籤</p>
<p>財政部統戊，振濟，建設等六種公債，昨晨在滬舉行還本抽籤。計一，統一公債戊稱債票巾籤十八支，金額四百六十八萬元。二，民國二十七年振濟公債中債，十二支，金額卅六萬元。三，民國三十年建設公債中籤五支，金額二百萬元。四，民國三十一年同盟勝利公債中籤四十支，金額四千萬元。五，民國三十二年整理省債公債中籤二十一支，金額一千另七十九萬一千元。六，民國三十三年同盟勝利公價，中籤六支，金額三千萬元。</p>
<h3>六區棉紡公會　向紡調建議兩點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會，昨舉行第九五次常務理事會，重要報告事項，有該會對存棉及生產報告，業已發出通知及表格，囑各同業即日塡就，於本週內送會，以便彙送紡調會。</p>
<p>該會理事長王啓宇，常務理事劉靖基，榮一心等，昨日往訪紡調會主委袁良，王氏等會建議二點：　原棉供應，望能做到定時定量定質，以免生產中斷。　對花紗布新政策，望政府應做到合情合理，勿妨碍農業及工業之生產。聞袁氏常表示：決做到合情合理地步，惟原棉供應辦法，則正在計劃中。</p>
<p>該會將定於本週六下午，茶會招待袁主委，即席聆聽關於花紗　管制之意見云。</p>
<h3>銀根大緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨銀根大緊，暗息達二角四。四行二局差進一千零十九億，中央入六三五億，大交換入五九六億，外商入六六二億，小交換出一〇八五億，中國入三七一億。</p>
<h3>食糖回振</h3>
<p>昨糖市均趨上展，升四五萬元不一。公會劃盤，二四粗白棧單爲一百廿一萬元，現貨大包一百廿三萬元。二〇中砂白一百十二萬元，台赤呌一百十五萬元，汕提　九十二萬元，次致八十八萬十八萬元，簍莊一百十三于萬元．興赤1百零七八萬元至一百十萬元，刁靑八十四萬元，共開出千數件。</p>
<h3>外銷茶堅穩</h3>
<p>內銷茶仍因去化不衰，全日經過活絡狀態，均與上日相仿。至於洋莊茶市，賣戶居奇扳售之念，依然迭茁，而出口商雖有趨前問津，但出價咸帶慳吝，是以雙方談判之結果，猶難順利，交易遂少生色，市氣則堅定如故。</p>
<h3>紡建紡調大量供售　面紗價初高後回　布疋上升現棉交易稀少</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巾國紡建公司及紡調會，昨因新版關金券發行伊始，爲平絲紗市起見，特大量售紗。紡建共售各支紗一七一二二件，合廿支紗二八〇二件半。內除配本市複製業外，並加配外埠各縣複製業，售價以廿支紗爲準，仍爲二八一一萬元。</p>
<p>此外紡調會在棉紗市塲開紗，結果共售一六二三件，合廿支紗二一二六件。售價六支一五四〇萬元，廿支三〇五〇萬元，卅二支三九五〇萬元，四二支四二五〇萬元，四十二支雙股四八五〇萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉紗市况，初開因大票發行關係，人心看好，行情一致提高。旋以紡建公司配紗掛價不動，額量增加，市上銀根軋緊，各方頗多拋售，散多套套賣不寂，市勢微見回軟，但午收市盤，四十二支藍鳳比上日步漲五十萬，爲四千九百二十萬元，其餘各支粗細紗亦升三五十萬元不等　棉布市况，晨開人心挺俏，繼以軌空風起，買戶特旺，市盤均見喊高。至十點半許，經監人員蒞塲監視，交易轉稀，且銀根抽緊，價乃由高趨低，但結果十二磅龍頭等各紗細布，仍比上日二漲自五千至三，五萬元。全日趨勢，一九〇士林布因染料及廠盤關係，上升有自五萬至十五萬元之鉅，漂布粗布細斜及元色布吸收有人，軋升自十二三萬至五六萬不］，惟　嘰及直貫等則見　定。</p>
<p>昨日現棉成交稀少，貨主扳俏，買戶觀望，喊價甚高，賣買雙方，難以接近，致交易沉寂，成交三百包。</p>
<h3>各地物價一斑</h3>
<p>無錫〔本報無錫十日電〕此間物價，受大鈔影響，白粳門售八十四萬，昇四五萬，小麥七九萬，帶起四萬，兵舶粉三十一萬元，提昇二萬，麩皮　俏，每包廿八萬，食油一九三萬，激昇十萬，其餘各物，莫不一致飛騰。</p>
<p>蘇州〔本報蘇州十日電〕今日此問百物競漲，白米價上日原已突破八十萬關，創新紀錄，今日中午逐升至八十七萬，下午再破九十萬關，漲達九十一萬。縣府特於下午召見社會科長勵介夫，諭令以全力撲滅此人爲之漲風，嚴密查禁，乘機拉抬商人，決予嚴　懲。</p>
<p>重慶〔本報重慶十日電〕大鈔發行，市塲波動。布疋昂揚，昨訂貨未有存單者，今迭起糾紛。紗無市，美金公債七萬八千，又四川絲業公司提高絲價，二十二號白絲九千萬，黃絲八千九百萬。</p>

<h3>大鈔刺激尙微華股漲後急回</h3>
<p>華股昨漲後急回，大鈔之刺激，僅在初開時有買方蠢動，當局對各種物資，大量拋出，銀根見緊，廣帮南京帮證券帮傾售，臨收量低。晨開倘利非常，永紗開高至即泥升半成，大通中紡內衣　安小交四二四元，　交四二七元，買到即交四三二元，遞交四三元高價。紛紛脫售者多，塲外息價開二角二分半及二角七，加之剪綫工作十分嚴厲，逐步下游至四一五元左右。經稍賣而到四一二元及四一三元。其後雖復稍回升，終以銀根大緊，羣情惶惶，復有借款消息·各方　胃甚　·返午即交破四百大關，退至三九八元，遞交見四〇一元低價，午收爲四〇一元及四〇三元，收後喊價仍低。結果除雜股交易不暢者外，咸感黯然無光，較前收即交股計　總跌一成，閘北景福勤興中法新華火柴山絲各跌半成，中升，新光信和美亞永公中興均平，餘均微跌。遞交股計華　勤興跌半成，餘均微降。</p>

<h3>文化的故事</h3>
<p>— 傳統先</p>
<p>美國·社倫Will　Durant著The　Story　of　CiviizationSimon　and　schusten　New　York,一九四二初版1048頁　美金六元</p>
<p>近來在家裹讀到兩部關於世界文化歷史的鉅製：一本是英國托恩比（toynbee）的「歷史之研究」；一本是美國杜倫的「文化的故事」。前書是研究歷史哲學的，共分十三大部分，現已出書六大冊，尙僅及全書之第五部分，將來預備另文介紹。杜倫的「文化的故事」是敘述世界文化歷史的，共分五大部分，已出三大冊，僅及東方文明及西方古典時代以前的文化。這種以全部　力專心致力於某一種專門工作的精神傎是使我們感覺到敬佩和慚愧。中國這個社會並沒有培植專門學術的硏究人材。相反的，在殘　他們。物質基礎的貧乏，社會風氣的腐敗，政治因素的牽通使許多的學者所用非所學，整天忙着許多莫名其妙的事情，終之一事無成，虛度此生。本人以此責　，亦願以此勉人。</p>
<p>社倫以「哲學的紋事」一需而聞名。哲學書籍一般人每視爲艱深難　而不敢嘗試·但杜倫的「哲學的故事」文字淸秀，說理明晰，從哲學家的生活故事中闡述其理論，說來　　　人．所以那本畫至今還是銷路最好，流通甚廣的。在三十多年前作者想着手寫一部「十九世記史」，但是他發現着非澈底追溯到人類歷史的起始，這種工作是不可能的。於是他便計劃寫一部分大的世界文化史。其巾包括五大部分!</p>
<p>東方的文化　敍述埃及和近東到亞力山大之亡爲止；印度，巾國和日　的文化到現在爲止．導言是說明文化之本質與因素。</p>
<p>古典的文化：敍述希臘和羅馬的文化以及在希臘羅馬統治之下的近東文化。</p>
<p>中古的文化：敍述天主敎和封建制度下的歐洲文化，拜占庭的文化，回敎和猶太敎在亞洲，非洲和西班牙方面的文化，以及意大利釣文藝復興</p>
<p>歐洲的文化：敍述歐洲各國宗敎革命至法國革命之間的文化歷史。</p>
<p>近代的文化：敍述歐洲自從拿破倫到今日在政治，科學，哲學，宗敎，道德，文學，　術各方面的發展。</p>
<p>第一部分是一九二七年開始，一九三五年完成出版，至一九四二年已銷至第八版。本人讀到的是第八版，本文也祇能簡單的介紹這1本書的內容。作者在本書的序言中說；「我要以最少　篇幅把人類在文化上的買獻儘量的述說出來。我們要追溯一切史事的前因後果，各種發明的進步，經濟組綫的變化，政治制度的　　，宗　信仰的　　，道德風氣的突創，文學　　　創造，以及科學哲理的發展。」過去寫文化史的人總是喜歡分成經濟史，政治史，宗敎更，哲學史，文學史，科學史等等，然後再分成許多的時代。這都免不了枝齜破碎的毛弊。人類的生活是整個的，所以人類的文化史無論在　的方面或　的方面都應該是一個完整的敘述。當然因為人類生活在各方面的發展太複雜，太專門化，假使山一個人作一個綜合的述說，其中　免有偏　、遺　和錯誤的地万。但是我們郤不能因此而無視於人類對於他們自己的文化應有一個綜合而整個的認識的這個需要。</p>
<p>這一本書是專講東方文化的，僅爲「文化的故事」的五分之一·此書又分成三卷。開始是　言，討論「文化的建立」，分六章：　文化的條件（包括地質，地理，經濟，種族和心理五方面的基本條件）；　文化的經濟因素（包括　從遊收到農業；２.工業基礎，2.經濟組織）！　又化的政治因素——政府的來源，國家，法律，家庭；　文化的道德因素——兩性關係，社　風氣，宗敎信仰；　文化之心理因素——語言！文字，科學，藝術；史前文化之來源。</p>
<p>第一卷近東文化，其間叙述Sumeria·埃及，巴比倫，亞叙利亞，猶太，波斯等國的經濟生活，政治情况，宗敎道德，語言文學，哲學思想各方而。</p>
<p>第二卷印度文化史，共分九章：　印度之基礎；　佛歐異釋迦；　從亞力山大到Aurangzob！　印度人民之生活（包括其　濟生活，社會組織，道德婚姻，風俗習慣）；　神靈天界（說明印度敎，佛敎以及各和奇異信仰的神雲境界；　印度之思想學派；　印度之文學（包括語言，敎育，詩歌，戲劇等）；　印度　術（包括音樂，印刷，雕刻，建專等），　基　敎在印度之　　（其中特別說到太戈　和甘地）。</p>
<p>第三卷遠東之文化，包括中國與“本兩部分。關於中國部分，他把周代稱爲思想家的時代，此間他討論到中國上古的文化，後講到老子，孔子，和楊　的哲學　他把秦漢唐代稱爲詩人的時代，以李白杜甫做代表　又把宋以後稱為　術家的時代，討　到　國的銅器　陶瓷，　　，寶塔宮殿。然後有兩　：一章是汎論中國的人民和國家；一章是　中國的革命和新生。關於日本部分，他　到日本的創造者，日本的政治道德基礎，傳統日本的思想藝術，最後一章講新日本自從維新之後在工業和文化上的改革，一直談到美日的關係。作者著述此書時係在珍珠港戰事之前，他認為美國不一定要打日本。他說：「我們敎會了日本工業　驗季的技術，使日木成功了東亞經濟　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　無　担心日本人之　力　　。世界之大，美日當可並存。太平洋之廣當使　　間大有和平相處之　　」。不知杜倫在十二八珍珠港戰事突發時曾有「我不亡日本，日本必將亡我」之感慨否？</p>
<p>關於中國之新生，作者頗多鼓勵，使我國　者深　受之有　。他說：「軍　和經濟上的勝利都不能長期　制中國。當侵略者已精疲力盡時此東万之　則猶未損及絲卷。異族的統治渚將在一世紀中被其所同化。中國不久將熟習一切所謂現代工業。交通道路將便她統一；　濟節儉將使她財富；政府健强將使她和平。一切的混亂都是過渡時應有的現象……革命是腐朽的減亡。革命之發生是由於許多東西應該予以消滅。中國曾經死亡過多少次，但多少次她又曾經復生了！」讀到了這一段文章再回想到魏德邁對於中國現狀　嚴重批評誠使人啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>作者杜倫博士曾於哥倫比亞大學從杜威研究哲學並會執敎於母校。英文流暢，說理富於文學意味，雖千多頁的大書使人讀之不倦。很希望中國從　學術思想的人把它翻譯出來，當可有益於　西文化之交流。</p>
<h3>臺灣產業界這發達</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>失去了五十一年的台灣，已投入祖國的懷抱；這個歸來的孩子，不僅是帶來了人情的溫馨，還帶來了大宗的財產。當祖國經過八年的抗戰，各處都是濟痍的　　，對於這一宗財產，是很可貴的·一般人認爲台　的建設，是我們得到的一筆意外收獲，其買這並不是日本人所留下州的，而是台胞五十一年汗血所灌溉的結果，我們要格外地珍惜。</p>
<p>臺灣地跨熱帶和亞熱帶的緯交上，氣候溫和，雨量充沛，土地肥沃，物產　寫。米年可收獲兩季，淸初已有餘糧這至內地。北外若糖，茶，水產，樟腦　物，亦多運歸祖國。故早年台灣和祖國問的貿易相當繁盛．甲午戰後，台灣割　於日本。日人鑒於台島土地膏沃，且有三百餘萬台胞可供其驅策，於是積極地開發，不製年成績已大爲可觀，成爲日本之外府，叮供其無厭的剝削和榨取。</p>
<p>日人　經營灣，素採農業台灣，工業日本的政策，所以工業並未高度的發展。迨太平洋戰事發生後，由於日本軍事的要朮，和台灣本身的需要，各種工業，次第興起，即如重工業之冶金，煉鋼，製鋁，煉迪等工廠，也相繼設立。台灣的經濟，遂漸漸地由農業步入了工業的階段。</p>
<p>臺灣的收回，對於我國的經濟上，確有很大的帮助，同時也加重了我國的負担。我們要珍惜過去台胞所流的汗血，不祇是對現有的產業要加以維護，更須進一步加以發展。特別在戰爭的後期，台灣的主要產業，遭受了不少的破壞和損失，恢復起來，就不是一件暫易的工作。過去兩年間，台灣的產業，雖已有許多恢復了，但尚未達到昔日的　觀，這還待我們的努力。</p>
<p>要恢復臺灣的產業，進而要開發台灣的產　，必須光　明瞭台灣產業　的情形。「台灣產業界之「　」一書。是很好的借鏡。　　　　信君，旅居台灣有年，對於台灣產　界的情形，深爲洞悉　全省所　可說是台灣產業界之　　。</p>
<p>全　分十二章，以台灣的生產事業爲中心，所有農　，林業．水產，礦產，工業均有詳細叙述，製糖工業，另立一章，以示其重要。此外對於台進的土地，氣候，人口，商業，交通，貿易等項，凡與產業州有關者，記無餘。日人過去經營台灣之　形，若財政制度，專賣制度、問亦論及，而於台　收復前的各項統計資料，更爲珍貴。日人過去五十一年經營台灣之歷史，正可作爲我國今後開發之參考。</p>
<p>臺灣和海南島，是我國沿海眼睛，地位都很重要。臺灣被日人經營了半世紀，已進入工業化的途徑，但海南島迄今除沿海一帶外，大部都未曾開發。其實海南島的而積，比台灣更大，蘊藏的物產，比台灣更　富，而開發的條件更爲有利。當此開發海南島的聲浪，塵囂日上，漸漸透露環境相似，經營台　的情形，也可作爲開發海南島的參考。故作者特將「台灣的發達和海南島的開發」一章，以　全書之後。使那遠處在南海中的荒島，在最近的將來，化漠野爲膏腴，和台灣並駕齊驅。</p>
<h3>物質之新觀念</h3>
<p>— 中浣</p>
<p>（C.　G.　Darwtn著，　　　譯，</p>
<p>商務版，自然科學小業嘗之一）</p>
<p>商務印書館有兩部好的小業演一部是數學小業書，另一部就是自然科學小叢書，這兩部小業書極適合靑年參考，進修之用，是兩部極有價値的讀物，這我們不得不歸功於商務印書館的努力。</p>
<p>「物質之新觀念」是C.　G.Darwin敎授在波士頓羅威爾學院講演的底稿改寫而成，新以牠的編制是根據謂時的佈局，分成大致等長的八章，因之牠和別的書略爲不同。</p>
<p>本書的目的是在叙明構成物質基本成分的觀念，所以本書的第一竟所包括的就是關於原子·電十·質子·光十等的定義，和原子的構造，　得又簡單又淸楚，比普通的敎科書中的叙述明白得多。　完原子構造後，下面接着講波，繞射，測不準原理，不相容原理，偏極化，碰撞等，將造成物理世界的基本成分的觀念，作一有系統的介紹。</p>
<p>因爲本書當初是講給羅威爾　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，對高中程度的靑年前　　比較的太　　一點。所以，　的時候切不可和　通通谷科學　一樣，應該聚精會　地，抓住　中的主到處。</p>
<p>本書附有挿　　幅，都畫得「簡單」「淸晰」「明瞭」，使我們在　隨時便利不少、尤其名貴的是　張　　，都是在試驗具體的印象。</p>
<p>全書　　在第二第三　　，講波和物質的　射，講得比敎料畫詳細，而且很扼要，所以這本　量好是在　完了高等物理的光學後再來　牠。</p>
<p>最　　到翻譯方面，譯者楊　　先生是國內有名的學者，譯得好極了，不過我認爲有個缺點，也是自然科學小業書·製學小叢書所共有的缺點，就是本書是文言的。科學書籍本已深與　難讀，現在再用文言翻，更其高深更其艱晦，希望賢明的商務當同予以改良，　好是用白話　，才能使靑年們不致因為文言　　，而對於這一類的書减低興趣；才能使靑年們把寶貴的光陰用來進修。</p>
<h3>開明英文文法</h3>
<p>— 朱方</p>
<p>林語堂著　開明書店出版</p>
<p>英文法，在學校裏，常認爲是枯燥乏味的一科；但是，這並不是英文法本身的過失，實在因爲一般舊式文法書的編制不良，與敎學者呆板死記規則的緣故而致。</p>
<p>這本開明英文文法，是一部最前提的文法　，一反從前的編制方式，而究全以說英語者的意念（Notions）做出發點，根據了心理學來討論表現法和英人固有的思想方法。但是作者並未純以理論爲主，因爲他要顧及實用方面，所以這本書，用作高中的敎本也很適當。</p>
<p>而且這裏還有很多有趣的材料，所以即使一個厭惡文法的學生，我想他看了這太書後，也不會討厭的。假使英文程度較差，而且譯者還加添一些原書沒有的，關於中文方面的註釋。這本漢譯本也是開明出版的。</p>
<p>全書共分十六章：「表現法的科學」，「調類及其作用的轉變」，「句的語氣」，一人與事物及其性」，「數和量」，「重量，價値，體積，距離，形狀，位置」，「代表法」，「指定法」，「修飾法」，「比較和等級」，「動作的各方面」，「主語和　語（外射動作）」，「動作時間」，「事實和想像」，「關係」，「表現法的經濟」。最後還有形式文法概要及索引等。</p>
<h3>讀師陀的「結婚」</h3>
<p>— 沈露</p>
<p>上海瀹陷的幾年間——無疑的，這原光就複熱萬分的社會，其本　上，當然要發生積聚而強烈底　化：所謂　雲時會，　中問包括了多少大小人物的浮沉，悲劇和喜劇也不斷地更多的演出了。可是，戰爭結束後，很遺憾的極少反映那個期間的社會形相和生活的文藝作品出現，這裏談到的師陀的中篇創作「結婚」，該算是這極少數中問的一種了。</p>
<p>「結婚」分上下兩卷，上卷分成六封信，以書信體的形式寫出，下卷則分成六章，却以純粹的小說體裁寫出。縱觀全書，作渚所着力刻盡的男主人公胡去惡是一個在人海裏浮沉的知　份子（敎員），性格上有善良的本　但也有一般知識份子所特具的動搖性和妥協性，一開始，作者為他為了要想籌劃一筆款子跟他未婚妻一個叫　芳的知　女子結婚，（其實也是爲了要生活下去）在這　　　而動　的社會中他就想到只有做生意的一途了。本畫上卷的六封信，都是作爲男主人公胡去惡寫給他未婚妻佩芳（本簡潔：「我惟一的親人佩芳，你們終於走了，留下我，回到鄉下老家去了！上海依　人山人海，齪齪，雜亂，騷擾，謠言，暗殺，掠奪，紅　萬丈；可是一陣風，你們走了，我心裏也給刮光了。在幾百萬人口的上海，他舉目無親，像條斷纜的船，載浮載沉，被捲來　去。他冷了，餓了，病了，死了，誰關心他？誰想到他？」·：……「錢固然苦壞了我，同時也苦壞了你們，你恨它還得愛它。在你們走後，我會反　想過，如果不打仗，我手裏能多　　點錢，按照預定討劃，我們現花應該結過婚了。這就是我上封信裏說，要做生意的原因。我本來可以不告訴你，以因爲太愛你，我才跟你商量，我沒想到竟會遭你反對。你說我們大家都還年輕，等到戰爭結束不遲，你說做生意沒有把握，太不淸高，你又說傎的辛福並非建立在金錢上面。……可是我的小空想家請容我問一聲，假使戰爭打一百年，我們難道也得等它一百年？」從這裏，我們自然地觸摸着一個在現實生　　浮沉掙扎的苦痛的靈魂的自白。</p>
<p>下面　還有更沉痛的控訴：「……我想你父親，三十年的老敎員，人家早該坐在家裏納福了，他還得拿老骨頭苦苦跟窮困掙扎。他不是不愛我們，但爲了氣節，爲了不肯聽命於日本人及狐羣狗黨，他寗願捨棄終身事業，硬着心腸，讓你從大學退學，聽你弟弟失學，自己回老家小鎭上開雜貨舖。這是對國家的諷刺，佩芳，同時也是淚，用淚也寫不盡的蜚痛！現在你總該相信，我之想賺錢，並非單爲我們自己，你我將來簡單幸福的小家庭，還爲你父親母親弟弟，我們不能只願自已。」</p>
<p>書信叙述發展到這裏爲止，胡去惡終於加入了不學無術的舊式小官僚家庭子弟，典型的洋場惡少，投機商人，尚慕虛榮，實際上却是性格脆弱的上海小姐，和有過輝煌身世的可憐蟲，但却寒峭，傲慢，自負這一羣人的圈子幹起生意經來了。</p>
<p>下卷以小說體裁寫出的，就以這些物間的糾纏爲綫索而勾盡出淪陷時期上海的社會相！最後我們的男主人公胡表惡終於做完好夢受盡敗騙不得不出　殺人的手段來發洩絕望的情緒了，當時的上海傳是這樣一個地方（共實現在還不就是這樣！）「不管被殺也罷，殺人也罷，只要死的不是自己，人們得照樣去謀生，跟誰都沒有關係。譬如向大海投個石子，石子究了，大海空無影響·」（見「結婚」的結尾。）</p>
<p>從「結婚」裏我們看到胡去惡這個知識份子的典型，他怎樣跟生活鬥爭又如何地動搖和妥協！過程的交代頗見明晰，這人的沒落和幻滅，作者也隱喻出了社會的環境和此人本身的弱點。—傎不啻爲一面知識份子的鏡子，令人警慯！</p>
<p>我們知道師陀就是蘆焚，在戰前他的一些短篇小說和散文，大都淸麗可誦，作者緊向擅長描叙鄉土，措叙小人物，風格質樸醇厚，且感情深長，又不是時下一般只顧政治目的不顧藝術價値的粗錢條文藝作品可與比擬的了。現在讓了「結婚」，我覺得出現在他筆下的這羣大都會的小人物，又是同樣地生動突出。字裏行間，見出莊諧細膩之處，這都是作者成功的地方，而瑕疵也即在此：因爲這機，像「結婚」這作品，嚴格地說，由於前後形式的懸殊，我們在分析它結構和着眼於　叙手法的時候就發現某些地方　得鬆懈和難以呼應，落筆的輕重上也使人有「過」與「不及」之感整個說來，結婚仍不失爲一部表現了時代片斷，現實人物的作品，今日讀來，仍使人感到親切，這是什麼緣故？我想讀過這本警的人都該覺得，今日的上海社會還不跟書裏所刻繪的相彷彿麼？</p>

<h3>王揖唐與金壁輝</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>北平之審奸，最受注目而資談柄者，一男一女：男即王揖唐，他給與觀衆的印象，是「憊懶」，彷彿「五人義」一劇中之「地葫蘆」；女即金碧輝，她的印象是「潑辣」，彷彿「酸炎嶺」之巴九奶奶。</p>
<p>王揖唐榜名志洋，又改賡，又以字行名揖唐·又　　塘，又號什公，又號今傳是樓主人，衆稱「王鬍子J。這個老好，歷史甚長，怪劇甚多，今年七十歲，亦算「古稀大慶」。自就補以來，歷經大審，他的特別秘訣是一裝雙做啞，裝病賣傻，十問十不答」。問籍貫？不答。問姓名？不答。間住處？不答。問以前做過甚麼事情？不答。問參加組織僞府甚麼意思？不答。問在僞長任內的叛國媚敵行爲？一概不答。審了一庭又一庭，不答不答總不答。如此沉得住氣，已不愧十年面壁，入定功深（「鬆子」自命精於彈學）。偶然作囈語腔，說出「聽不見」，「不明白」幾個字，更見襯托之妙。</p>
<p>在先，人們以爲此鬍偌大年紀，鐵窗生活，心情錯亂，精神困頓，或是實情。不料他於第一次判刑之後，出人不意，突對堂上法官何君「倒打一耙」！向上級機關控訴，認得何某曾在自己為長屬下司法講習所做過敎務主任，亦是漢奸，以小漢奸而審判大淡奸，於理不合，於心不甘。果然，監察使對何彈劾，撤職查辦，王鬍子這1著高棋，有了特效。他好像是學的「四進士」劇中之宋士杰，末塲被按院毛朋判非之後，因楊素貞認淸了毛朋就是松林寫狀的人，他就二次上堂，反詰毛朋說：「你就是犯法的頭一名！」果然，毛朋被他拿住把柄，只得下位賠小心，反而恭維老宋r是一個說不到的老先生」，於是老宋無罪了！然而那是戲文，不合傎理，何法官縱然是小漢奸，王鬍子亦不能免於大漢奸之罪。可是何法官却到底被髪子打倒了，這又合了「草船借箭」劇中魯肅對孔明的話：「死還要拉一個墊背的1﹂由此觀之，此老奸之病也，聾也，皆是僞裝，傎正十足的「老奸巨猾」！</p>
<p>由病院用病床抬到監獄收押，由監獄抬到法庭受審，三番五次，抬來抬去，觀衆們傎像看把，由　獄抬到法庭受審，三番五戲一樣。一個　士出身的老人，身份何在！王克　雖是奸魁，一死卻倒干凈，勝！子　矣。</p>
<p>金璧　一名碧暉，又呌川島芳子，人稱「金司令」。昔年　其親父　　（前淸肅王）及其日父川島浪速，幹了許多驚險百出的怪事　光復後被捕，　屆大審，又在堂上演出任何男奸女奸所未曾有的怪腔怪詞句。「　　　咤」，大似　王項羽，辟易千人！法官問話，她處處轉取攻勢力。問她一句，她反問兩句；問她兩句，她反問三句。問她是否事愛騎馬，舞劍，踢球等等雜技，她反問這些亦犯法嗎？你不問正經，間閑話！以階下囚而敎訓堂上人，傎乃聞所未聞，而向着庭上所懸總理遺像鞠躬稱「孫老伯」，更是突梯之尤。四年前汪精衛以僞主席巡視舊京時，她曾以日人之介，與汪敘起父執之誼（汪刺淸攝政王時，　　曾爲力　免死監禁），稱汪爲「老伯」，可見她有隨便稱人「老伯」之癖。</p>
<p>她做司令時，對日本憲兵隊很不客氣，高紀毅（張學良時代之北寗路局長）被倭捕押，她去救了出來，還把倭兵連打帶駡，此事頗足快意，不可以人廢也。</p>
<h3>書劃避能</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>競爭是一種好現象，人人都有競爭之心，社會才能進步，非獨書盡爲然也。但人的天賦有不同，故其成就亦各有異，如果在必欲擅名於後世時，則必須改換方向，努力從事其他部門，其結果也可以達到異質同妍，否則你的名只永遠在他人之下，蔽而不彰，故竸爭不得，退而避能易幟，也是一種賢明的措置。史稱張長史　魯公始同學正書，張自知不及顏，去而爲草，名遂大起。又中昊紀　　：楊惠之初亦學畫，見吳這子　高，遂去為　工，名亦擅天下。至於淸初常熟顧雪坡徐鐵山少時，本與王石谷同　山永，後石谷從太倉王烟客王元照兩公遊，得見宋元人傎跡，學問日進，雪坡鐵山度不能勝之，遂一去而畫竹，一去而畫馬，兩人亦並臻極詣（均見柳南隨筆）。可見凡事只有妒忌是要不得的，避能並不是壞事。</p>
<h3>統計</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>南非聯邦的總理史末資將軍，在就任後不久，準備向議會發表一篇重要的施政演說，他就把他的秘書呌來、吩咐他仔細去查一查檔案，因爲這篇演說中有好幾處都需要精確的統計資料，以資說明。</p>
<p>七個鎭頭之後，他的秘書同來報告說；「將軍，你所需要的統計材料，整理一下至少要五年工夫，目前是沒有一個人能够查出來的。」</p>
<p>到了下一天，史末資準時出席議會，發表了一　極動人的演說，每一要點都有詳盡的統計數字補充說明。議員們大爲感動，而史末資的秘書更是欽佩得五體投地。等到史末責回到辦公應的時候，那位秘書就問他：「你今天的統計材料傎豐富當極了，請問是誰代你查出來的？</p>
<p>吏未資將軍說：「你昨天不是說過，沒有一個人能在五年之內查出這些統計數字來嗎？所以，我就自己隨便地統計了一下。反正誰又會　掉五年工夫，來查我的統計數字是　　　　！」</p>
<h3>兒童傳記文學</h3>
<p>— 文介</p>
<p>我國傳記文學至今未見發達，即有，亦限於幾位少數的所謂名人傳或偉人自傳。從前曾聞某編輯說：要記什麼人，這人必須限於名人或偉人，這話或許有「生意」上的理由，至於在「文學」的立塲言，傳記並無必限名人偉人之理。比方張點生的「異人傳」，此書頗有文學上的價値，可是究其內容，所記並非全是名人偉人，而寫來竟頗足一傳。</p>
<p>而且據我看來，名人偉人寫到傳或自傳，心中必存好一個「不朽」的念頭，行文之際難免掩飾一番，甚至向壁虛構，或揑造事實，不易做到坦白陳述的地步。如果傎的把如何營私，如何受賄記了下來，把醜事陰私傳了下去，雖然不失爲傎正的傳記，然而「名人」「偉人」也就失其「名」「偉」之處了。準此，我們與其重視所謂「巨子」的傳記，不如把視綫轉移過來，注意一下「小子」的行動。所謂「小子」，我是指兒童。</p>
<p>我們日常生活中一天到晚所關注的是軍國大事，以及不幸與軍國大事發生了密切關係的油　醬醋。但與友朋相過，所談莫非與上述二大項目有關，而誰無孩子，可是除禮貌上的必要外，鮮有交換關於各自孩子的情華的，足見我輩對於孩子的缺少汪意。雖說也是生活艱難使然，以致無暇及此，可是一般執筆爲文之士於關注要人要事之餘，盍不稍分其精力移注於我們的兒童呢？</p>
<p>即以小說而論，中外古今的著作大都以成人爲對象，即有小孩出現，大半也是配角。純粹以小孩子爲對象的小說，即在歐美恐亦並不多觀。像亞米契斯的「愛的敎育」，愛爾考克·魯易莎的「小婦人」「小男人」等純粹描寫兒童的小說，在西洋也是不可多得的作品。在我們中國，據我所知，屬於這一類的作品恐怕只有一部：老舍的「小坡的生日」。而老舍的這本作品上半部寫得很好，下半部是寫得不很好</p>
<p>旣然我們大都各有自己的孩子，如果本刋編輯不反對的話，何不主辦一次「我的孩子」的徵文呢？喬其·克拉勃有一句話：「凡是有感覺的人對於小孩子的喋喋之言，總是感覺興趣的，而做父母的聽了，簡直是無上的快樂。」﹁無上的快樂」實在也並不限於孩子的言語，行動似也可以包括在內。我們不妨把「無上一的快樂」來互相交換一下。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第三章　台上與台下</p>
<p>見他祇呆着臉，聽得入神，向他肘道：「戲快散了，還不走？」者齊才回過神來，見塲內座客已紛紛起坐，心意還貪戀臺上的戲，又不便不走，已經站起，還要看一會，經不起雲卿連連扯他衣角，催他快走，遲了怕擁擠，只好扶着雲卿，和保　似的，　送到門外，　好車送她回去。到雲卿家門，渚　因爲時問太晚，不肯進去，已回　走了，麼　又把他喚住　：「我有一句話，忘記問你，今天戲禀是誰送給你的？」渚齋心裏一動，隨口應道：「是銀行同人送給我的。」雲卿道：「不是綺紈嗎？」說着，笑一笑，不待渚　答　，逕走進去。渚　聽了，心裏很難過，悵悵坐車回去。</p>
<p>第二日早上才有十點多鐘，渚齋剛到銀行不久，綺紈便來電話，叫他就去。渚　告訴她，必須到下班才能去，綺紈在電話埋怨道：「請一個　頭假，來我這裏說幾句話都不行呀！我有要緊話告訴你。」渚齋一聽綺紈電話，心裏早已突突跳動，再聽有要緊話要告訴他，那能不去，當下連連答應，把耳機揖上，隨託同事招呼，忙忙趕到綺紈家裹。一問小王媽，綺紈還汝起床呢，　齋大爲躊躇。正在爲難，他二人說話的聲着，早給綺紈在臥室內聽見，問道：「是徐先生嗎？請進來吧。」渚齋走進去，只見綺紈躺在床上，秀　蓬鬆，散在機枕上，一床　被，只蓋齊胸，露出大紅色軟緞睡衣，兩彎手臂，豁露在外，對渚齋微微一笑，說聲「對不住」，指着床前一張椅－j’，請他坐下。渚齋見綺紈臉上還帶昨宵殘脂剩粉，肌膚雪白，睡後臉上，帶着1種艷光，美麗之極，不由呆住。接着又聽綺紈說道：「我是性急的人，心裏有什麼話都藏不住，我耍問你，昨天和你坐在一起看戲的，那位就是你的太太吧？」渚齊沒胡到綺紈會問他這話，以爲淸早約他來，無非要討論昨天的戲演得如何，綺紈這一問，倒出他意外，忙應道：「不是的，不是的。」綺紈道：「那　，是你什麼人？」渚齋道：「是我表妹。」綺紈道：「啊，是你的表妹！你的太太爲什麼不去？」渚齋道：「她不懂看戲。」綺紈道：「她不懂看戲，那末，你那位令表妹，一定是行家了。」渚齋道：「她在裕仁大學畢業，專研究詞曲，對於京劇，也很感興趣。」綺紈道：「京劇普通人都懂得，不一定須硏究詞曲專家。我昨天送你兩張戲票，原預備你同你太太去的。今晚我的戲碼是玉堂春，我希望你和太太同去。」渚齋聽了，心上甚是爲難，暗忖我那位不時髭的太太，怎能帶她到台面上！綺紈見渚齋退疑不語，又說道：「今天你的太太必須賞光，她不去，便是看不起我。」</p>
<h3>美國人的想法</h3>
<p>— 道先</p>
<p>美國Collier's雜誌的記者湯瑪斯伍爾夫（ThomasH.　Wolf）最近乘公共汽車完成了一次橫斷尖國大陸的旅行，自紐約直到西雅圖。他這次旅行的目的，完全是要遇到許多普通的美國人——那些乘公共汽車旅行的美國人，探詢他們日常想的是些甚麼問題，談的是些甚麼事情，有些甚麼苦惱和憂慮。</p>
<p>在九天的旅行，三千哩路的途程上，伍爾夫遇到各種職業不同，宗敎信仰不同，年齡不同的美國人。他們多半是開始度假期或是假期已滿歸去，還有許多是去拜訪親友的。這些人來自半個美國。</p>
<p>伍爾夫直到和每一輛車上的三四十個乘客，都談過話以後，他就跳下事子，等下一部車子來，如此不斷的訪問下去。他所提出的只有一個問題：「在你們那裏，最近大家常講的是些甚麼？想的是些什么？」假使答案的材料不多，他再提出一些特殊的問題，如物價，房荒，國內政治，世界太局，國外貸款，孤立主義，和聯合國等。</p>
<p>將許的答案綜合歸納起來，伍爾夫得到今日美國人對於自己和世界的看法。</p>
<p>美國人最關心的，是個人的，純粹地方性的間題。各個地方的人，對於物價的高漲，房租的高昂，和房屋的缺乏，都最爲關切。同時因爲物價高，許多做母親的也都出外謀生，孩子缺乏母親的敎養，更由於房荒，家中大小都擠在一起，孩子都路到街上　混，造成嚴重的少年罪犯問題，許多人也都引為杞憂。</p>
<p>一般美國人並擔心美國將發生經濟蕭條，但許多人都感覺到混亂和不滿。</p>
<p>對於美國國內的其他事情，不論是政治，捐稅或勞工問題，一般人似都不大注意或關心。</p>
<p>除了物價和房屋問題以外，美國人最關心的是世界大局，主要的是蘇聯問題。各地的美國人都很注意國際問題，大家講得最多的是美蘇關係。美國人不斷的探求國際知識‵他們所聽的無綫電，所讀的報紙和雜誌，都比以前多。</p>
<p>美國東部的人對於戰爭綫得較多；到了西部平原以後，這種話題太减。雖然許多美國人都說第三次大戰是無法避免的——他們對戰爭將屢發時間的估計，從六個月到二十五年不等，但多數人並不是傎正覺得戰爭快要到來了。而且幾乎每一個人，都不對未來的戰爭擔心。</p>
<p>伍爾夫沒有遇到有誰在談論或考慮孤立主義，但這並不是說，所有非孤立主義的人都贊成貸款給歐洲。大多數美國人是贊成貸款給歐洲的，但多是爲了人道主義的理由，並以先救濟美國國內為基礎。</p>
<p>這就是伍爾夫採訪所提的結論。從這裏我們可以知道中美的人民，都在為物價和房荒兩大問題發愁。但我們也可以看出，在今天，中國人對美國的興趣，和美國人對中國的關心之間，是有　很不短的距　。在伍爾夫的三子　　采訪中，沒有一個　國人提到中國！</p>
<p>像重慶評話</p>
<h3>試車與騐「票」</h3>
<p>— 白蕪文　龍生畫</p>
<p>離也不能否認，已非政治經濟中心的重嚴有兩「多」：一是穿西裝的人，雖然多數像「羅宋　三」所着，却着者多於上海。一是汽車，雖然汽車不能開下重慶最多的坡坎，但車仍多得似乎有意偏向　坡　示成。</p>
<p>孔子說：「以吾從大夫之後，不可徒行也」。似乎車是專為官們凖備的；重慶卻不盡然，據我所知，往往是坐着劉湘時代的一個團長，舊貨店（拍賣行）老關。失業舞女，金鈔經紀人之類，似乎必經過「　叙」的</p>
<p>汽車逐漸多起來的時候，是廿七年，於是熱血的新聞記者憤然了，會到戲院門前去抄號碼，在第二天報上一長出發表出來，而且發出車主名單，標上一個題曰：「一滴汽汕一消血，拋向淸歌妙舞中」！</p>
<p>今天，重慶又多了許多吉普車，漆得五顏六色。洋人已走盡了，換上了中國人，但爲了够派，却必須也載一個或幾個女郞，「有女同車」，必須以喝够了番檳的姿態，開得像在追一列火車或逃一輛辦車，不然不像加萊古柏。不止一次，不但撞了幾部黃包車，還顚覆了　　亭，揚長而去。儿此，警察都只有干瞪眼，倘一加欄阻，便乾脆坦克似的從身上輾過去。報紙也已　見不鮮</p>
<p>這種車，大抵不槿沒有開車執照，連車的號碼是也沒有的，有時在玻璃上貼一張價箋，上書「試車」二字。其意若曰：車還在試，殺人自不負責。誰呌你來供給我之「試」？</p>
<p>遇到這種車，我是一點也不充好漢的，趕緊躱避到人行道上，也不咀咒它是「市虎」什麼的。據說，遇虎的人只要上樹，可是誰看員老虎撞倒了大樹或電綫桿？吃了人，老虎也決不振振有詞地推諉到被吃者橫越路心，證明該死：「自行失足落」—于輪下。</p>
<p>即使避到人行道上，倘是雨天，重慶的特種瀝青路上的泥　，經過每小時百公里的速率的衝激，也會古　上　龍吐霧似的，扇形的流矢般噴上身來。</p>
<p>重慶每年死傷於此下的寃魂，倘加統計，決不比一隊什麼編餘大隊之頭的少，蓋可斷言。附告：　禍的司機人也有不逃走的，則是停下車，並不下來，轉背向主人拿＋張名片交給望察，彷彿說：「請驗死者的勾魂票」！於是來一個倒車，便可衝開圍觀的閒漢，趁勢飛駛而去。人們對它的背影車　只有眨眨眼。</p>

<h3>Raising Prices and Disrupting Finance: Ministry of Finance Declares Firm Legal Action; Three Thousand Tons of Selected Rice Expected to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the Central Bank's issuance of Customs Gold Unit notes in denominations of 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000, the Ministry of Finance stated through a spokesperson: In recent months, the Ministry has received requests from various banking associations and chambers of commerce to issue large-denomination banknotes for ease of payment. After careful consideration to meet the current practical needs, these requests have been approved. The Central Bank is instructed to issue them in various localities. Merchants and civilians must not take this opportunity to raise prices. The Ministry has also instructed local governments and financial management institutions to closely monitor and strictly prosecute any instances of profiteering and financial disruption according to the law.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 10th] Due to the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, the local financial situation has experienced slight fluctuations. The Hong Kong dollar has risen sharply, from 260 to 320. General commodity prices have subsequently increased. It is reported that this surge in foreign currency is largely due to withdrawals from Shanghai. Although the upward trend is relatively intense, it proves that the amount of floating capital in Guangzhou is stronger than that in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 10th] The National Bank received a telegram from its head office on the morning of the 10th regarding the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, without any other instructions. Large-denomination notes of 10,000 and above have not yet arrived. Commodity prices have generally risen following the news of the large-denomination banknotes' release. The fastest increase has been in the black market for gold.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Jinan, 10th] After the news of the large-denomination banknotes' issuance reached Jinan, the prices of all commodities uniformly rose. Flour increased by 10,000, with top-grade flour reaching 430,000 per bag. 20-count locally produced cotton yarn rose by 2.8 million, with each piece reaching as high as 39.8 million. The black market for gold has soared.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 10th] After the news of the large-denomination banknotes' issuance spread here, the financial market suddenly became chaotic. Transactions in all industries were hesitant and cautious, with no deals made all day.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xian, 10th] Commodity prices in Xian on the 10th rose due to the emergence of large-denomination banknotes, but not as drastically as expected. Apart from a relatively high increase in the price of cigarettes, rice was priced at 1.35 million per 100 catties, and no flour was available for sale. The main reason for this phenomenon is the tight credit situation. It is generally believed that commodity prices may rise sharply within the next week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 10th] According to the most reliable sources, the 3,300 tons of selected rice allocated to China by the International Emergency Food Committee for the second half of this year is expected to arrive in Shanghai before the first month of the next year. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Chen" vessel recently arrived here to load the first batch of selected rice for return to China.</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang Answers Reporters' Questions: National Banks' Business Contraction Aims to Curb Speculation; Loans Will Be Reopened After Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's telegram to the Central Government, requesting that the National Banks reopen lending and revise the restrictions on foreign exchange, Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, Dong Xianguang, replied to inquiries at a press conference on the 10th: The government's establishment of National Banks was originally intended to support industry and commerce and facilitate the people. This has been consistent for thousands of years, and the facts are there, so there is no need for much explanation. As for the recent order to contract business, it was originally a temporary countermeasure due to rampant speculation and soaring prices in Shanghai, and it has already shown considerable effect. Once prices have stabilized for a period of time, the banks will resume their original mission and continue to operate. It is hoped that industry and commerce will understand the current difficulties and work together to sanction speculation and eradicate the recurrence of past price surges. Whether legitimate industry and commerce can maintain long-term prosperity depends entirely on how everyone works together.</p>
<h3>This Year's Direct Tax Revenue Reaches 150 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 10th] According to well-informed semi-official sources, this year's direct tax revenue is 150 billion yuan in national currency, exceeding last year's by sixteen times. Direct taxes include income tax, inheritance tax, stamp tax, profit tax, and special business tax. Economic experts are currently drafting a new direct tax law that will impose hefty fines on tax evaders. This reform is an important part of the government's new plan to balance revenue and expenditure.</p>
<h3>Settlement Method for Pre-War Deposit Interest Passed by Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economics Committee</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The settlement method for pre-war deposit interest was reviewed and passed by the joint meeting of the Finance and Economics Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the 10th and will be submitted to the plenary session for discussion. During the discussion at the joint meeting, opinions were divided into two factions. One faction believed that the matter should be resolved as soon as possible so that the price and debt disputes that have lasted for several years can be cleared up as soon as possible. The opposing faction believed that if calculated according to the previous method, the banks would be too cheap. In the end, the majority believed that in this period of continuous decline in currency value, it is appropriate to settle at an earlier date, even if the multiplier is not large. As a result, it was passed as proposed, except that the point in the original proposal that allowed National Banks' loans in coordination with national policy to be an exception was deleted due to majority opposition.</p>
<h3>Preventing Bridge Currency Evasion: Ministry of Finance Prohibits Receipt and Payment of Hong Kong and Macao National Currency Remittances</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Finance has been closely monitoring and trying to remedy the outflow of remittances to Hong Kong. In order to prevent capital flight and strengthen the absorption of remittances, the receipt and payment of national currency remittances to and from Hong Kong, as well as the handling of collection and payment business entrusted by Hong Kong and Macao counterparts to local banks and firms, have all been prohibited. Since the government promulgated new foreign exchange control measures in August of this year, allowing remittances to be settled at market prices, the situation of remittances has improved. Recently, the government is also discussing with the Hong Kong authorities ways to prevent smuggling in South China and economic cooperation, in order to bring remittances into the proper channels and prevent any further evasion.</p>
<h3>Macao to Restrict Metal Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 10th] It is reported that Macao is about to restrict metal imports and exports in accordance with the regulations of the International Monetary Fund. Currently, metals are flown here twice a week, mostly transshipped to various parts of South China.</p>
<h3>Postal and Telecommunications Price Increases Take Effect Today</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The matter of increasing postal rates has been decided by the National Government meeting. During the period of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, the Executive Yuan is authorized to make adjustments at any time depending on the circumstances. The adjusted new prices will take effect from the 11th. The Directorate General of Posts has already telegraphed the whole country to implement them simultaneously. The new prices are as follows: postcards, 1,000 yuan per piece; regular mail, 2,000 yuan per 20 grams; express mail, 4,000 yuan; registered mail, 5,000 yuan; double-registered mail, 8,000 yuan; express delivery, 7,000 yuan; express delivery with return receipt, 11,000 yuan; airmail postcards, 2,000 yuan; regular mail, 3,000 yuan; express mail, 5,000 yuan; registered mail, 6,000 yuan; double-registered mail, 9,000 yuan; express delivery, 8,000 yuan; express delivery with return receipt, 11,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Domestic telegram rates were adjusted to 1,000 yuan per word on July 1st. To date, it has been almost half a year, and losses have been significant in recent months. The Directorate General of Telegraphs has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to increase telegram rates by two times from December 11th, changing them to 3,000 yuan per word for ordinary telegrams. Telephone rates will also be adjusted simultaneously, increasing by two times. The wartime telegram rate was one dime per word. The most recent rate adjustment is 20,000 times the pre-war rate.</p>
<p>[This City News] Domestic telegram and long-distance telephone rates will be readjusted from 00:00 on December 11th. The measures are as follows: Domestic telegrams of all types; All types of telegrams sent from domestic locations to Hong Kong and Macao; Ship telegrams to and from domestic locations; Long-distance telephone rates, etc., except for social telegrams with attached gift certificates, which will be changed to 5,000 yuan per time, will all be increased by two times the original price.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices in Northern and Southern Mines Approved for Adjustment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently approved the following adjustments to coal prices in various mines, effective December 1st: Kailuan coal delivered at Qinhuangdao, 1.08 million yuan per ton; Huainan coal delivered at Pujiang, 1.176 million yuan per ton; East China coal delivered at Pujiang, 1.348 million yuan per ton; Hebei coal delivered at Keelung, 1.05 million yuan per ton; Foreign coal per ton, 2.84 million yuan. The above adjusted prices are 40 percent higher than in November. The Fuel Control Committee has also stated to various mines that no further price increases may be requested within this year.</p>
<h3>Li Gan Goes to the US to Negotiate Aid to China; Canadian Aircraft Loaded for Shipment to China</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding US economic aid, both sides will hold further talks in Washington. Li Gan, our representative to the Far East Economic Commission, has transferred to the US from Baguio after the meeting and will discuss everything in detail with the US authorities.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 10th] The first batch of Canadian-made Mosquito bombers sold to the Chinese government is scheduled to be shipped from here on the 10th. The remaining aircraft stored at the airport here have been sold to the Chinese government and are awaiting disarmament and shipment.</p>
<h3>The Number of Our Soldiers Going to Japan Unresolved; MacArthur Only Approves 24</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Our country's garrison in Japan is fully assembled and prepared, only the number of allowed personel remains unresolved. General MacArthur's Headquarters only approves of 24 people, while our government wants to dispatch 40 people. The mutual negotiation has not resulted in a final decision, which is why the trip has not yet happened. Currently, the 40 soliders chosen to go to Japan are undergoing Japanese and English training every day and are regularly lectured about the situation in Japan by members of the delegation stationed in Japan. Their uniforms are all newly made and their morale is very good.</p>
<h3>British and American Trading Companies in Guangzhou Register with Consulates, Requesting Import Quotas</h3>
<p>[United Press, Guangzhou, 10th] More than 80 representatives of British and American trading companies in Guangzhou have registered with consulates here, all requesting import quotas. Citibank's Guangzhou branch will reopen in Shamian. Other American trading companies from before the Pacific War will also resume their businesses. Several major British trading companies in Hong Kong will also re-establish branches here.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu Arrives in Nanjing to Report on the War; Says the Future of the Far East Economic Commission is Unpredictable; Thailand's Absence Affects the Food Problem</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Jiang Tingfu, our representative to the United Nations Security Council, returned to China from Baguio and stayed in Shanghai for a few days due to illness. He arrived in Nanjing by overnight train on the 9th and went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs around 9:00 on the morning of the 10th to confer with Minister Wang Shijie and Vice Ministers Liu and Ye for a long time. He also had lunch with them at 12:00. In the afternoon, he met with Premier Zhang Qun at 6:00 and stayed for dinner. When interviewed by this newspaper's reporter in the afternoon, Jiang said that his conclusion on the Far East Economic Commission was: "The future is unpredictable. If done well, it may achieve something." He gave an example: the core of the Far East Economic Commission's work is to solve the urgent problems of food, fuel transportation, and supply. After the war, the supply of these necessities of life has not been properly adjusted due to reduced production in producing areas and increased shortages in consuming areas. This phenomenon is particularly severe in the Far East. At the previous meeting, all countries discussed this, but at the beginning of this meeting, the dispute over the qualifications of participating countries took up seven days. The Dutch East Indies issue is being discussed by representatives of the United States, France, and Australia with the parties to the dispute, seeking a solution. In fact, participating in international conferences does not necessarily require prior recognition as an independent country. The Far East Economic Commission actually affected the conference agenda due to the Indonesian membership issue, which is necessary. Jiang admitted that Thailand's failure to participate in this meeting has an impact on the solution of the food problem and hinted that concrete possible plans and sufficient financial resources and materials will determine the success or failure of the Far East Economic Commission. As for his comments on the Security Council, he said: "As far as the Security Council is concerned with dealing with peace issues, I feel that most members are fair, but if members can be more proactive in handling issues and less focused on maintaining the status quo legally, the Security Council's contribution will be greater." Jiang denied previous reports from foreign media that he had stated that China advocated that Japan should join the United Nations after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. He will meet with Chairman Chiang within a few days and is expected to return to the US in three weeks to resume his duties.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Fly to Hong Kong to Handle the Kowloon Walled City Issue; Ye Gongchao Declares at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Sources familiar with the matter revealed that although the 11th is the deadline for the Hong Kong government to order the Chinese residents of Kowloon Walled City to demolish their houses, as a result of continuous negotiations between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British side, this measure may be temporarily suspended. The issues existing in this area are still under serious consideration by both sides, and if no other incidents occur, a satisfactory solution can be quickly obtained.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Vice Minister Ye Gongchao answered reporters' questions at a press conference held by the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau on the 10th as follows:</p>
<p>Q: The Hong Kong government has ordered the eviction of Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City. What measures will the Chinese government take?</p>
<p>A: The Chinese government is paying close attention to this matter. Guo Dehua, the special envoy for Guangdong and Guangxi, is currently in Nanjing reporting to Minister Wang Shijie and has scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the next available flight to discuss the matter with the Hong Kong government, in order to reach a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Q: If the United Nations requests China to send troops to Palestine to maintain order in the Holy Land, what is the Chinese government's attitude towards this?</p>
<p>A: Neither the Chinese government nor the Chinese delegation to the United Nations has heard of the dispatch of Chinese troops to Palestine.</p>
<p>Q: Regarding the Chinese government's request to be listed as one of the invited countries to the peace conference with Germany, has the Chinese government received any reply from the Soviet government?</p>
<p>A: To date, the Chinese government has not received a reply from the Soviet government on this matter.</p>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 10th] A Hong Kong government spokesman said on the 10th that "no protests have been received from the Chinese side" regarding the forced eviction of residents in Kowloon Walled City. However, the spokesman admitted that China's protest may be withheld at the British Embassy in Nanjing. He said that the eviction order was based on the 1932 ordinance, which stipulates that others cannot reside unless the Hong Kong government cultivates the land.

<p>[United Press, This City News] A United Press reporter recently returned from an inspection of China's northern frontier and deeply feels that China is at risk of losing the area, which is about half the size of China proper. The Soviet Union is currently eyeing the area covetously, waiting for an opportunity to seize Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and the Northeast, in order to expand its satellite territory. The Soviet Union has long coveted the Northeast, which goes without saying. Its strategy between Siberia and China proper is also the same as in Europe, which is to use mass organizations to seize political power. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>

<p>[This Newspaper, Kaifeng, 10th] After two major victories in Wanxi's Neixiang and Zhenping, the Wanxi troops recently created a second amazing feat in Xixiakou, a major town belonging to Neixiang in Wanxi.

According to a telegram sent by Xue Bingling, commander of the Neixiang militia, to Governor Liu of Henan Province this afternoon to report the victory: Chen's bandits attacked Xixiakou. For four days and nights, it did not stop for a moment. The intensity of the artillery fire was like a violent storm, and the walls of the stockade were destroyed by it. There were numerous casualties outside the stockade, but the communists still rushed forward in a continuous stream, approaching under the cover of artillery fire. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of our troops fought bravely, and the bandits never succeeded. Yesterday afternoon, a certain unit of our troops detoured behind the bandits and encircled the stockade. The troops also launched a fierce counterattack from the stockade, and the National Army also arrived at the same time. Under mutual attack, the bandits suffered as many as 6,000 casualties.

<h3>The Partition of Palestine</h3>
<p>Since the United Nations General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan on the 29th of last month with a vote of 33 to 13, Jews everywhere have celebrated the success of their Zionist movement. However, the majority of Arabs in Palestine and other places with the same religious beliefs as the Arabs are extremely indignant. Even when the United Nations General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, the representatives of the six Arab nations left the meeting in protest, accusing the majority of "assassinating" the United Nations Charter. At the same time, the Prime Minister of Lebanon declared: "We are waiting for an opportunity to act, and once the opportunity arrives, we will move towards our goal." As for what the so-called goal and opportunity refer to, we can vaguely see an outline due to recent developments. Recently, the conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine has become increasingly acute. Even the commander-in-chief of the army preparing to establish the Jewish state in Palestine was assassinated, and bloodshed is constantly occurring. At this moment, we see the Arab League meeting in Cairo, and the British Commander-in-Chief in Palestine has announced that British troops will begin withdrawing from Palestine on December 15th and will completely leave the Holy Land by next August, in preparation for handing Palestine over to the Arab and Jewish states. Currently, the bloodshed and unrest in Palestine are in full swing. At this juncture, we see reports inviting our country's troops to be stationed in the Holy Land for guard duty. Based on this, it can be seen that the development of the situation in Palestine is not only related to the success or failure of the United Nations as an international organization and the guarantee of world peace in the future, but also to our country's position in international politics in the future. We must pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly's passage of the Palestine partition plan was originally after considerable consideration. Before passing this plan, a fact-finding mission was sent to the Holy Land to conduct on-site investigations. When this case was submitted to the General Assembly, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union were not necessarily consistent. The Soviet Union initially appeared to support the Arab nations, thereby gaining their favor. When the partition plan was proposed, it strongly supported the Arab nations, indicating that it was unwilling to align with the United States in order to elevate its position. After several twists and turns, the Soviet Union stated that it would no longer adhere to its prejudices. As a result, the United States and the Soviet Union reached a consensus, and the Palestine partition plan was finally passed by the United Nations General Assembly. According to this plan, the Holy Land will be divided into Arab and Jewish states next August, and the holy site of the Holy Land, Jerusalem, will be under international co-management and will not belong to either the Arab or Jewish states. Due to the passage of this motion, the Palestine issue, which had not been resolved for thirty years, has finally been resolved on paper. However, given the Arab people's resolute opposition and willingness to shed blood to maintain the integrity of the Holy Land, it can be seen that the Palestine issue does not seem to be resolved by the passage of the United Nations General Assembly motion, or it may even cause new disputes as a result.</p>
<p>We must first understand that the problem of Palestine is actually the result of the First World War. This can be divided into two aspects: First, before the First World War, Palestine was a part of the old Turkish Empire. Under the Turkish Empire, Palestine could originally coexist peacefully. The result of the First World War was the disintegration of the Turkish Empire. France obtained Syria and Lebanon; Britain also obtained Iraq and Palestine. When the League of Nations was established, Britain and France obtained the so-called mandate rule in these places. Based on this mandate from the League of Nations, Britain has held the power of rule in Palestine to this day. Second, during the First World War, Palestine was a part of the Turkish Empire, but the Turkish Empire was Britain's enemy. Therefore, Britain used all sorts of methods to try to divide the Turkish Empire, which was originally an indispensable strategy in warfare. Among these many plans to divide the Turkish Empire, one of them was to promote the return of Jews to the Jewish homeland. The famous Balfour Declaration clearly stated Britain's willingness to help the Jews restore their country. It should be known that Jews have been scattered around the world for two thousand years, and have even been to China. In Kaifeng, the Jews continued to preserve their "Israel" religion and temples until the late Qing Dynasty. In their homeland, the descendants of the Jews have almost become extinct and have been completely occupied by Arabs. Britain's support for the Jews' restoration of their country was not out of love for them, but to dismantle the platform of the Turkish Empire. This was a strategy of war and was very obvious. However, due to the disintegration of the Turkish Empire after the First World War, Britain had to fulfill its promise to help the Jews restore their country. The Jews in Palestine today can be said to have mostly returned after the end of the First World War.</p>
<p>Since the historical background of the Palestine problem is like this, we believe that the partition plan passed by the United Nations General Assembly this time is regrettable. Needless to say, all Arab nations have expressed dissatisfaction with this, and other nations that believe in Islam are also indignant. If the United Nations loses the trust of the people who believe in Islam as a result, it would be very regrettable. As for the passage of this motion representing the closeness of American and Soviet views, the result seems to be the opposite. It is truly said to be the Soviet Union's cunning diplomacy. The Soviet Union is geographically closer to Palestine. The Soviet Union also has stationed troops in southern Russia. Once something happens in the Near East, it can quickly send troops. It is also secretly promoting the return of a large number of Jews in Eastern Europe to Judea. It accepts the partition plan because it fears that there will be no peace in the Near East. If something happens in the Near East, it can find an excuse to quickly send a large army to establish a foothold on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. In this sense, the Soviet Union accepted the partition plan, and the United States also supported this case, and finally passed the partition plan. Due to the existing signs, Palestine will likely be troubled by this. The lack of foresight and firm policy of the United States on the Palestine issue is also truly lamentable.</p>
<p>As for the matter of inviting Chinese troops to guard the Holy Land, our government has denied it. If there is such a thing, our government will certainly refuse it. When the United Nations General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, our country's representative abstained and did not vote. Our country's decision not to participate in the Palestine dispute is wise. What we do not understand is: Since the Palestine problem mainly arose due to British policy, and now that it has reached a point where it is difficult to resolve, Britain is preparing to withdraw quickly. We certainly know the difficulties that Britain is currently encountering, but we also know that Britain is the nation that values responsibility the most. Now, they are so eager to leave, isn't there a suspicion of evading responsibility? "Plucking votes from the fire" is the magnanimity of the American nation; however, in international politics, only magnanimity seems not enough. There should also be the vision and firm policy of a statesman. This is the case on the Palestine issue, and it is the same on other issues. Only in this way can the United States lead the world, and only then can world peace be guaranteed!</p>

<h3>American Reporter Talks About the Situation in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Executive Headquarters, stated to reporters today that the Ili rebellion in western Xinjiang was instigated by the Soviet Union. This statement has now been confirmed by foreign observers returning to Shanghai from Ili. The Ili rebels have an army of 50,000 men trained by the Soviet Union, demanding Xinjiang's independence and the establishment of the so-called "East Turkestan Republic," and refusing to negotiate with the Chinese government. Han Chinese account for only 10% of the province's population. Located in a remote area, transportation to the mainland is virtually cut off except by air. The limited number of troops stationed in the provincial capital have very limited ammunition and are definitely no match for the rebels backed by the Soviet Union. Once Xinjiang breaks away from China, the rebels will immediately unite with the Soviet Union economically and militarily and become its satellite state. Although Inner Mongolia also demands autonomy, it is wary of the Soviet Union and knows that it cannot resist the invasion of Outer Mongolia. The reporter traveled to Inner Mongolia last year and interviewed a chieftain of a certain banner, Prince Duerbe, sixty miles from the Outer Mongolian border. He was told that if Inner Mongolia gains freedom, it fears that it will follow the same disastrous path as Outer Mongolia. The only choice at present is to choose the lesser of two evils between Outer Mongolia and China. The people of Inner Mongolia are severely affected by poverty, are simple-minded, and cowardly. Outer Mongolian troops often harass them, looting sheep and horses. However, the national government is busy dealing with the civil war and has no time to spare to protect them and alleviate their suffering. In some places, Outer Mongolian invasions occur as often as twice a month. Although there have been no conflicts with the Nationalist army yet, if they do come into contact, the government does not have sufficient troops in Inner Mongolia to defend. Prince De also said: "I and all the people are afraid that the Outer Mongolian army will eventually launch a large-scale invasion and permanently occupy Inner Mongolia. I firmly believe that Outer Mongolia's advance is on the orders of the Soviet Union, otherwise it would not do this. Before Outer Mongolia was occupied by the Soviet Union, the people's inclination was the same as that of Inner Mongolia, but after Soviet indoctrination, their hearts have now changed and they have become accustomed to violence."</p>

<h3>Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly Battle Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, announced the battle situation for the week (December 3rd to 10th) at a press conference on the 10th, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of Bandit Suppression in the Dabie Mountain Area</p>
<p>What needs to be specially explained this week is the situation of bandit suppression in the Dabie Mountain area. Since the National Army began its campaign, it has successively recovered Lihuang, Luotian, Yingshan, Xishui, Xuanhua Store and other places. Recently, it has also moved into Yuexi, a key point in the Dabie Mountain area, as well as various strongholds at the foot of the Dabie Mountain between Macheng, Guangshan, and Huang'an. It continues to press towards the mountainous area between Jingfu and Huang'an, the core area where the Liu bandits gather supplies. At the same time, our troops from Shangshan and Xinyang are also advancing to the southeast. As a result, under the attack from all sides, the Liu bandits had to abandon their original dream of establishing a base area in the Dabie Mountain area and gradually moved their main force to the northwest, intending to avoid a decisive battle and preserve their strength. According to a report from the front line a few days ago, although the 11th Column of the Liu bandits, after moving towards the Lin Station near the Ping-Han Railway for a period of time, disintegrated into smaller groups at night, successively mobilizing seven to eight thousand people, reached the Jiahe River area west of the railway, they were surrounded by the National Army. One deputy regimental commander of the bandit army has surrendered to the National Army with weapons and leading more than 500 bandits. More than 1,000 other bandits are also in contact to surrender. In addition, in the areas of Damao Fan and Xishuanghe, more than 1,400 bandits were captured, and more than 1,100 were wounded or killed. That bandit force was unable to escape, with fewer than 2,000 remaining. As for the bandit army of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 intercepted by the National Army in the areas of Sanlicheng and Jinjiawan east of the railway, they have been scattered, scrambling to escape. There are also remnants of about two columns fleeing towards Gushi, who fled from west of Lihuang after being attacked by our army advancing west from Lihuang and retreating to that area, are also wandering aimlessly. Judging from the current situation, the National Army has taken the first successful step in defeating the Liu bandits and crushing their offensive to establish a foothold in the Dabie Mountain area.</p>
<p>Chen Yi Bandit's Flight in the Yu-Wan Border Area</p>
<p>Chen Yi's bandit units of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns in the Yu-Wan border area, since crossing south of the Longhai Railway, were first defeated west of the Jinpu Railway, and then driven out of various counties in the Yellow River flood area, with no time to catch their breath, fleeing everywhere. From northern Henan, eastern Henan, western Anhui, and southern Henan, they are desperately fleeing. One part is still in the Huaiyang Zhoujiakou area. If they go south to join forces with the Liu bandits, they will surely perish together. If they return north, they are afraid of being surrounded and attacked by the National Army again, and they are still hesitating on the wrong path, with the intention of continuing to sabotage the Longhai Railway.</p>
<p>There have been no battles in Western Shandong recently! Chen Yi's bandits, due to heavy losses, have now coerced more than 20,000 old and weak militiamen aged sixteen or seventeen and over fifty from north of the Yellow River, preparing to replenish the remnants of their failed attempts to stir up trouble outside the countryside, which shows that the bandits in Hebei are about to reach the point of "exhausting all able-bodied men."</p>
<p>Failure of Bandits in Jiaodong and Southern Shaanxi</p>
<p>In Jiaodong, the battles in Haiyang Jinkou and Nanjian were more intense. Although there are not many National Army troops in the area, they are extremely brave. The total number of bandits is more than 30,000, but due to their weak combat power and the clumsy command skills of the bandit leaders, they only drove one or two thousand innocent people to serve as cannon fodder, and the result was still failure.</p>
<p>The Kong Congzhou bandit unit in Southern Shaanxi is currently located in the Mianchuan Pass area. Part of Chen Geng's 4th Column and the main force of the Huo Column are still entrenched in the Lushan Nantai Fangcheng area. Recently, they had a fierce battle with the local militia near Xixiakou. News received yesterday stated that the bandits were counter-surrounded by the National Army and the militia, and more than 3,000 people were killed on the spot, and more than 1,400 guns were seized. According to captured prisoners, the Kong bandits have been surrounded internally, and the main force of the 4th Column is lurking in the Funiu Mountain area north of Neixiang. Overall, although Chen Geng's bandit unit claimed to have established two guerrilla bases after crossing the Yellow River and fleeing south, it has failed politically because the people have seen through his cunning and deceptive tricks and have developed strong aversion and courageous resistance. From this, it can be predicted that the future of the communist bandits' general counter-offensive is not very promising.</p>
<p>This Week's Battle Results are Extremely Fruitful</p>
<p>As of noon on the 10th, continuing to receive news from the front lines, summarizing this week's battle results, the National Army has defeated Liu Bocheng's main force in the Dabie Mountain area and restored eleven important towns in the Henan-Hubei border area. On the 9th, it also entered Jingfu. In addition, the bandits of the 6th Column of Huang'an have also fled from the northwest. According to incomplete statistics, six small cannons buried underground by the bandits were found in the mountainous area west of Shangtian, and military supplies and weapons of the bandit army were seized in Xuanhua Store, Jingfu, and Liuhe Xishuanghe, piled up like mountains, including more than 300 horses. More than 7,000 bandits have been wounded or killed, and more than 3,400 have been captured, including one regimental commander of the 81st Regiment of the 28th Brigade of the bandits, and fourteen political instructors, whose names are being investigated. Also, 780 bandits were captured and 400 bandits were killed between Gushi and Shangcheng at Shangshiqiao. In the Dong Jia Dian area west of Wusheng Guan Road, about 4,000 bandits from two *[missing text]* have been surrounded and can be annihilated soon.</p>

<h3>French-Soviet Relations Hang by a Thread France Refuses Soviet Protest and Returns Note Soviet Overseas Chinese Suspected of Participating in Strikes and Have Been Expelled from France</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: Paris Dispatch, French-Soviet relations have become more strained as the French government refuses to accept the Soviet note. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman believes that the conditions mentioned in the note are unacceptable, and the content is also based on inaccurate information. The French General Confederation of Labor has ordered the cessation of strikes. Currently, except for one million workers who have not yet returned to work, the rest have begun working, and the government's position has therefore been strengthened, but several major political and economic issues have not been resolved. However, the government's stance on the Soviet Union is quite firm.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The Soviet Union suspended French-Soviet economic negotiations and expelled the personnel of the French repatriation mission stationed in the Soviet Union. The French government refused to accept the Soviet note regarding these two matters on the 10th. The French Cabinet held a plenary meeting, and Prime Minister Schumann submitted a motion. With the unanimous agreement of the departments, the French Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, Chapentier, was instructed to send the Soviet note back to the Soviet Foreign Ministry and explain that the French government could not accept it. A cabinet spokesman said: "Before the French government received the note, its contents had already been published, and its conditions are sufficient to make us refuse to accept it." Developments on the morning of the 10th seemed to indicate the possibility of a break in French-Soviet diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 9th Dispatch] After the interruption of French-Soviet trade negotiations, the French government ordered the expulsion of the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation stationed in France on the 9th. The delegation left French territory by train via Strasbourg on the evening of the 9th. Afterwards, according to a foreign ministry spokesman, the French government's decision to expel the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation was due to the fact that some members of the delegation were engaged in secret activities that endangered French security and were related to the current labor unrest and riots in France, but were not directly engaged in espionage activities.</p>
<p>Colonel Filatov, head of the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation, was one of those involved in the aforementioned secret activities. It is also learned that a total of twelve members of the Soviet overseas Chinese delegation have been expelled, in addition to twenty Soviet citizens who have been arrested by the French authorities for allegedly engaging in activities that spy on French national interests and will be deported. According to sources from the Soviet Embassy, one of those arrested was an employee of the Soviet Embassy, but his name and rank are unknown. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires visited the Foreign Ministry on the afternoon of the 9th to formally protest the arrest of Soviet citizens, but officials at the Soviet Embassy refused to express their opinions when asked about the expulsion of the overseas Chinese delegation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] In the past three weeks, France has expelled 35 Soviets, reflecting the tense relations between France and the Soviet Union. Although the French side believes that the possibility of a break in French-Soviet diplomatic relations is unlikely, Soviet personnel stationed in Paris report that they believe that France's resolute measures are sufficient to cause a break in diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 9th Dispatch] According to news from London, diplomatic circles acknowledge that this development is related to France's foreign policy at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, with French Foreign Minister Bidault increasingly aligning with the United Kingdom and the United States at the conference.</p>
<h3>After the General Confederation of Labor Issued a Resumption Order, Most French Workers Resumed Work Workers in the Northern Mining Area Refuse to Surrender</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th Dispatch] After the French General Confederation of Labor issued an order on the 9th to resume work on the 10th, starting at 8:00 AM this morning, reports of resumption of work have come from all over the country, including one million striking workers, including miners, dock workers, steel workers, and transportation railway workers, from Paris to Marseille, from Le Havre to Lyon. All right-wing and centrist newspapers believe that the end of the strike is a major setback for communism. Leon Jouhaux, a communist leader of the National General Confederation of Labor, made a statement in the communist newspaper Humanité, declaring that the perseverance of the workers has forced the government to make concessions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The French resumption order was generally followed by workers, except in the northern mining area. Pickets in several northern mines are still trying to prevent returning workers from resuming work. Striking workers occupying the mines also refuse to surrender or return to work on their own.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] The French General Confederation of Labor issued a lengthy 2,000-word statement last night, calling on trade unions to unite their forces and prepare for a renewed struggle. It is said that most workers have been forced to resume work out of desperation due to hunger.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 10th Dispatch] Politicians acknowledge that Schumann is sufficient to eliminate the strike turmoil, saying: He has undoubtedly delayed De Gaulle's restoration of power by several months. The appearance of this order from the French government comes just hours after the Soviet Union announced the cessation of trade negotiations with France. Although there is no correlation between the Soviet Union's actions and the order of the French General Confederation of Labor, this matter demonstrates that the rift between the Schumann cabinet and the Soviet Union is widening, and it has gone a step further.</p>
<h3>Italian Government Accepts Demands General Strike Averted Cabinet Reorganization Negotiations to be Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: Rome Dispatch, The Italian government decided today to allocate 103.5 billion lire ($17,595,000) for the Rome development public utility plan, thus accepting one of the main demands of the Communist Party. The Communist Party is scheduled to begin a general strike in Rome at midnight.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 10th Dispatch] Prime Minister Gasperi declared today after ending a meeting with the leaders of the Social, Republican, and Labor parties, "Our discussions have lasted for a long time and are about to reach an end. I deeply believe that the attempt to expand the government's foundation and accommodate left-wing moderates can be completed today." Today is the deadline for the trade unions to demand a response from the government, and if there is no response before the deadline, a general strike will begin in Rome and the province tomorrow.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Negotiations Reach Agreement Wilson to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: A senior British government official said that he believes that British-Soviet trade negotiations have reached an agreement, and British Trade Minister Wilson is scheduled to return to the group from Moscow today, and he will not return empty-handed. However, the details of the negotiations have not yet been announced.</p>
<h3>Situation in the Soviet-Occupied Zone of Germany British and American Urge the Soviet Union to Submit Reports Four Powers Reach Agreement on German Import and Export Plans</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: The British and American sides believe that unless the Soviet Union provides a report on the situation in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, this foreign ministers' conference will not be able to reach any basic agreement on the German issue. Marshall and Bevin have jointly made this request to Molotov, whose reply was very smooth, claiming that if an agreement can be reached on the issues currently being discussed, the Soviet Union is very willing to provide this information, while Marshall and Bevin insist that the report must be provided first. According to various signs, Marshall seems to have become quite impatient and is preparing to end the conference, because Marshall is currently dealing with the most thorny affairs, and its outcome has a major relationship with the Marshall Plan and countries such as France and Italy, and cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] The Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 9th discussed the economic principles of Germany, passed the British proposal, and decided to draft an import and export plan for the entire Germany. Then, it discussed a chapter in the British document on the common use of resources in each occupied zone, which suggested abolishing the zone barriers, facilitating the free flow of materials, and using the resources of each zone for the entire Germany.</p>
<p>Molotov accepted this suggestion, but insisted that the establishment of a German central agency suggested in the Soviet document must be a prerequisite for the common use of resources in each zone. Marshall also expressed his acceptance of the British suggestion, but Bidault said that he could not accept it. Marshall suggested that items that could not be agreed upon should be temporarily set aside. Proceed to discuss the next item, and then hand the document over to the foreign ministers' representatives to rewrite it. This proposal was accepted.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 10th Dispatch] American officials privately stated today that the Soviet Union's demand for $10 billion in German reparations may become a major problem that causes the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to break down. It is believed that Soviet representative Molotov does not intend to agree to German economic unification until he receives guarantees that at least substantially meet his reparations demands. The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to discuss reparations this afternoon, but the United Kingdom and the United States have so far firmly opposed this demand. In the current situation, the Foreign Ministers' Conference is not expected to reach an important agreement.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister of Southern Visits Romanian Capital Signs Mutual Assistance Convention 保 Premier Submits Resignation and Cabinet Reorganized</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Romanian Capital, 9th Dispatch] Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito is scheduled to come to the Romanian Capital on the 9th to sign a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance between Southern and Romanian. Tito has signed a similar treaty with Hungary, and he will come here directly from the Hungarian capital. Tito also signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with Bulgaria in the Bulgarian capital ten days ago.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bulgarian Capital, 10th Dispatch] Political figures stated today that although Prime Minister Dimitrov led his cabinet members to submit their resignations last night after the new constitution was unanimously passed by the parliament, he may immediately form a new cabinet to comply with the provisions of the new constitution.</p>
<h3>Emergency Foreign Aid Bill American House of Representatives to Reduce it Heard that the Total Amount of the Funds Will be Reduced to $500 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th Dispatch] House Republican Leader Halleck declared today that he believes that the $590 million in temporary foreign aid funds will be substantially reduced again before the vote tonight or tomorrow, but he did not specify the exact amount. At the same time, the Republican leaders of the House of Representatives are said to have informally agreed to reduce the funds to $500 million.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th Dispatch] The $590 million temporary aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria is scheduled to be voted on in the House of Representatives on the 10th. The bill could have been submitted for a final vote on the 9th, but the debate on the amendment took up a lot of time, so the debate had to be extended. One of the amendments suggested reducing the supply of fertilizer to Europe when fertilizer is most scarce, which took an hour on Monday and two hours on Tuesday, before being rejected by a vote of 135 to 107.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th Dispatch] The House of Representatives also passed several amendments by voice vote today to prevent domestic price increases caused by the purchase of foreign aid materials. One of them prohibits raising prices to purchase foreign aid materials on the American market, and another suggests that the President issue measures for handling aid materials to prevent inventories from running out. An amendment requiring recipient countries to deposit local currency equal to the dollar value of the aid materials was rejected by the House of Representatives.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union is Training Special Talent to Promote Anti-Imperialist Policies Malenkov's Speech Published Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th Dispatch] Moscow Radio said: At the end of September, when Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Malenkov accompanied Zhdanov to Warsaw to attend the International Communist Conference, he delivered a speech to the Polish Communist Party Organization Bureau, stating that the Soviet Communist Party is training representatives to promote its foreign policy abroad. This speech has only recently been published by Pravda. According to Malenkov, the Soviet Communist Party is now paying special attention to foreign policy and training special talent so that the Soviet Communist Party's foreign policy can be effectively implemented by these personnel. These personnel should know how to safeguard the status and interests of socialist countries in the international arena, how to distinguish between friends and enemies, and how to thwart the conspiracies of imperialists and their spies. Communist parties in various countries must maintain close contact, otherwise it will be impossible to coordinate their actions to resist the plans of imperialism. Today, the United States is organizing anti-communist and anti-democratic movements to oppose the Soviet Union and other new democracies, attempting to enslave Europe under the guise of aid. Communist parties must clearly define their attitude towards these plans of the United States.</p>

<h3>Palestinian Issue Placed on the Agenda Security Council Postpones Discussion Egyptian and Lebanese Representatives Allowed to Attend and Make Statements</h3>
<p>[American News Agency, Lake Success, 9th Dispatch] The United Nations Security Council placed the Palestinian issue on the agenda today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th Dispatch] The Security Council met today to discuss the agenda of this session. American representative Johnson opposed discussing the Palestinian issue at this time, believing that it would be unwise to discuss it at this time due to the developments there. Syrian representative Curry immediately expressed opposition, pointing out that the Security Council has the sole responsibility for implementing the partition and should fully discuss all the issues arising from the partition.

<h3>Mayor Anxious, Directors Worried, New City Government Organization to Cut More Than a Thousand People, To Be Discussed in Tomorrow's Municipal Government Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The new organizational structure of this city's municipal government has been approved by the Executive Yuan and arrived at the city government last week. The reduction is as follows: The current establishment of the city government is 3,576 people, which should be reduced to 2,450 people, a decrease of 1,126 people. It has also been resolved to reduce 44 senior-grade officials, 331 intermediate-grade officials, 602 junior-grade officials, 10 assigned senior-grade officials, 75 assigned intermediate-grade officials, and 64 employees.</p>
<p>The various bureaus and offices of the city government should be streamlined and reduced as follows: In the city government itself, the number of counselors remains at six, and the number of specialists is reduced to six. The Secretariat, originally a senior-grade position, is now changed to an assigned senior-grade position. The Secretariat was originally ten sections, reduced to seven sections. The Information Office remains at two sections. The Personnel Office is reduced from four sections to three sections. The Statistics Office is reduced from four sections to three sections. The Accounting Office remains at three sections. The Civil Affairs Bureau is reduced to four sections. The Finance Bureau is reduced from twelve sections to eight sections. The Social Affairs Bureau is reduced from ten sections to eight sections. The Public Works Bureau is reduced from fourteen sections to eight sections. The Health Bureau is reduced from eleven sections to eight sections. The Land Administration Bureau remains at nine sections. The Police Bureau is reduced from nineteen sections to fifteen sections. The Public Utilities Bureau is reduced from fourteen sections to six sections. The regulations regarding senior-grade positions are as follows: City government: seven people; Civil Affairs Bureau: one person; Finance Bureau: one person; Education Bureau: one person; Social Affairs Bureau: two people; Land Administration Bureau: one person; Health Bureau: one person; Public Works Bureau: two people; Public Utilities Bureau: one person; Police Bureau: three people.

<p>Reporters visited relevant responsible persons in the city government yesterday to confirm the above news. It is reported that Mayor Wu is very worried about this, and the directors of various bureaus are also very anxious. For example, if the Public Utilities Bureau is slimmed down from ten sections to six sections, it will be impossible to work. During the effective period of authorization in the recovered area, although Mayor Wu still has the right to appoint extra personnel to the new organization, they cannot be submitted for review and will not be approved by the central government. It will be difficult to continue to employ them when the constitution is implemented next year. Therefore, the city government has decided to make slight reductions with great difficulty. If there are any points that cannot be complied with, it will submit them to the Executive Yuan for review and request that personnel be sent to Shanghai for on-site investigation. Detailed measures will be discussed in tomorrow's municipal government meeting.</p>

<h3>Gunshots in Shanghai Prison, Japanese War Criminal Asano Executed, No Last Words, Only Request to Sing a Song</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Japanese war criminal Takashi Asano was yesterday sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense. Asano was 34 years old, a native of Kawai County, Japan, and a warrant officer intelligence officer in the Foreign Affairs Section of the Japanese Shanghai Military Police Headquarters. He was accused of making the arrest of our personnel working in Shanghai his main task during the war, and continuously subjecting non-military personnel to torture. His crimes were notorious and the evidence was conclusive. He was previously sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal, and the order was approved by President Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government in a telegram on the 8th of this month, ordering its execution.</p>
<p>After receiving the order, Tribunal President Shi Meiyu, along with Clerk Wang Chenghua, Interpreter Wang Renming, and Chief Prosecutor Wang Jiamei, led a squad of armed military police to Shanghai Prison in Tilanqiao yesterday morning. A temporary courthouse was set up in the small courtyard inside the prison. At 11:45 AM, the prisoner was brought out. The prisoner was wearing a grass-yellow military uniform and yellow leather shoes, with a sallow complexion and his hands cuffed behind his back. After confirming his name, age, and origin, Tribunal President Shi informed him that he would be executed today and asked if he had any last words. Asano pondered for a moment and replied that he had no last words, but requested to sing a song. Tribunal President Shi did not allow it. Regarding the disposal of his belongings, Asano said that it was not necessary to send them back to his family in Japan, and that they should be given to the war criminals detained in Jiangwan. At this point, the handcuffs were loosened and he was ordered to fingerprint. At this moment, he suddenly remembered that he wanted to write a letter to say goodbye to war criminal Tokawa. The court ordered him to sit down and provided him with paper and a pencil. Asano paused from time to time while writing, lost in thought. He finished writing at 11:55 AM, signed the statement, and the handcuffs were put back on. Tribunal President Shi then ordered the execution. Two military policemen escorted him to the execution ground, where Military Policeman Wu Hun executed him. The bullet entered the back of his head and exited his forehead. He died instantly from the shot, at exactly 12:00 PM noon.</p>

<h3>Humans and Ghosts Living Together, Coffins in Disarray, A Picture of Refugees in Chao Hui Villa</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Amid the housing shortage, news has recently emerged of funeral parlors in the city being occupied by refugees from various places. So far, it is said that about a dozen units, including Chao Hui Villa, have been affected. In this so-called modern metropolis, is this scene of survival being played out a satire of civilization? A tragedy of the times? It really makes people feel at a loss! According to the person in charge of Chao Hui Villa: The occupation of the villa has only occurred in the most recent one or two periods. When they came to live there, the discipline was very poor. They would break through the walls at night and open the doors to come in. Moreover, without obtaining any consent, they automatically carried away the coffins stored in the funeral parlors one by one at night and occupied the vacated rooms.</p>
<p>According to his investigation, there are more than 2,000 people in this group claiming to be refugees, but as far as he knows, only 200 or 300 of them are truly refugees from war zones. The rest are mostly impoverished families near the villa or households who cannot find housing. Therefore, there are all kinds of people in this occupying group: vendors, shoemakers, rickshaw pullers, pedicab drivers, and even shops opened inside. There are also fashionable girls wearing gorgeous clothes and jewelry, entering and exiting by pedicab. Of course, there are also many truly impoverished refugees!</p>
<h3>A Tragic Scene</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter stole half a day of free time to visit the villa for a practical inspection. I felt that this picture of competing for survival was tragic enough. Nine out of ten of the funeral parlors were occupied. Most of the coffins originally resting in the funeral parlors were moved out without authorization by the occupiers and scattered in dilapidated funeral parlors with broken roofs and no doors or windows. Some could not be piled up and were exposed outside, at the mercy of the wind and rain. Some coffins were damaged during the moving process, and some coffin lids and bodies were on the verge of breaking apart. In several funeral parlors, entire families simply slept next to the coffins. Cooking utensils and stoves were set up everywhere. In several funeral parlors, there were some furniture and furnishings, and the layout was not too bad. A man and a woman were lying leisurely on a couch, dressed quite decently, chatting leisurely.</p>
<h3>Should Prevent Problems Before They Arise</h3>
<p>It is said that the responsible parties at Chao Hui Villa have sent representatives to Mayor Wu to request a solution. Mayor Wu has promised to instruct the Public Works Bureau to rush to build a large number of sheds on the site before the 20th of this month and try to accommodate these refugees.</p>
<p>The difficult situation of the refugees is to be sympathized with. They have been ravaged by war, leaving their homes and fleeing to this big city, and they are gathering more and more, and food, clothing, and housing are all problems. Moreover, the cruel winter is approaching. Behind this seemingly stable society, there seems to be a hidden tumor, and if this tumor is not resolved reasonably, it can fester and ulcerate at any time and have an impact on the general society. To prevent this tumor from festering and ulcerating is the common responsibility of the municipal authorities and the upper and middle classes of society and philanthropists who are in a better situation.</p>
<p>A Word of Advice</p>
<p>Who has no ancestors, who has no parents? The reporter finally wants to offer a word of advice to the refugees. Occupying the funeral parlor is one thing, but moving the coffins arbitrarily without obtaining consent, or even damaging the facilities of the funeral parlor, and damaging the coffins stored in the funeral parlor, will undoubtedly cause the refugees to lose the sympathy of society. The desire to survive is everyone's inherent desire, but we must seek survival on the condition that we do not infringe on the freedom of others, and we must not allow others to use the name of refugees to seek survival by benefiting themselves and harming others!</p>
<h3>Public Transportation Company Celebrates Second Anniversary of Operations, Grand Celebration, Mayor Inspects the Parade and Awards Medals</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday was the second anniversary of the opening of public bus service by the Public Transportation Company of this city. At 8:30 AM, a grand celebration was held on the square of the company at 959 East Daming Road. More than twenty people including Wu Guozhen, Wang Xiaolai, Zhao Zukang, and Zhang Shi attended. Zhao Zengjue presided over the event. At the beginning of the meeting, the company's entire staff of more than 500 people, dressed in uniforms, lined up on the side of the square. After Mayor Wu and others inspected the parade, Director Zhao reported on the general situation of the Public Transportation Company, stating briefly:</p>
<p>Supplementing North-South Transportation</p>
<p>The operation of public buses in this city for the past two years can be divided into two periods: the first year was the pioneering period, and the second year was the enrichment period. The layout of the bus route network has broken the segmentation phenomenon of the former concession era. The development of Shanghai City is from east to west, and the development of traffic routes in the past has mostly been east-west. The bus routes of this company are striving to supplement the deficiency of north-south traffic routes.</p>
<p>Solving the Problem of Transportation</p>
<p>At present, the company has a total of 233 vehicles, an increase of 92% over last year. The number of passengers has also increased by 90% over last year. According to statistics for October, it was more than 7.77 million people, and the total ticket revenue reached 18 billion. The company's vehicles are converted from Dodge F234 trucks, with wooden bodies at first, and lead skins this year. The chassis is also lowered and the wheelbase is lengthened. In the future, the company will try to add vehicles as much as possible to solve the public's transportation problem.</p>
<p>Cooperate to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mayor Wu expressed three points of feeling, stating briefly: Chinese people have a worst habit, which is to like to put on official airs. For example, employees of post offices and banks have given the public extremely bad impressions, and I hope that you will be humble and kind to others. Cherish public property. Every piece of paper and every object belonging to the public should be regarded as your own. Workers of the public bus company once went on strike due to salary issues, which is deeply regrettable. I hope that this will not happen again in the future. The country is currently in a difficult situation, and I hope that you will only seek to work hard, regardless of the amount of salary, so that we can cooperate with each other to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>Awarding Two Types of Medals</p>
<p>Afterwards, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, expressing his satisfaction with the company's work performance, and wishing that next year today, he will make all citizens feel more convenient in their travels. Finally, Mayor Wu awarded medals, divided into two types: service and safety. The service medal was awarded to employees of the company who did not take leave within one year. A total of 182 winners, represented by Xuan Tailin, accepted the award. The safety medal was awarded to drivers of the company who had no accidents within one year. A total of 79 winners, represented by Xing Hongguan, accepted the award. The conference concluded with the company song. In the afternoon, there were also entertainment and movie programs to celebrate.</p>

<h3>Attempted Murder of Mistress After Taking Poison, District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Report] He Hengsheng and Chen Caidi, a native of Yangzhou, became lovers. Recently, he learned that Chen was in love with someone else, and he suddenly developed murderous intent. He bought 10,000 yuan of sodium carbonate and also bought a pair of scissors, intending to kill Chen and then commit suicide by taking the sodium carbonate himself. On the 2nd of this month, He quietly got up while Chen was sleeping soundly, first dissolved the sodium carbonate in water and swallowed it, and then stabbed Chen in the neck with the scissors. Chen was in extreme pain and cried for help, and He also collapsed from the poison. Neighbors rushed to the scene upon hearing the cry and took them to Si Ming Hospital for emergency treatment. The case was transferred by the police station to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. Prosecutor Chen Tao concluded the investigation and believed that He was guilty of attempted murder, and filed a public prosecution yesterday.</p>
<h3>Band Leader Accused of Forgery</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chen, a well-known Chinese Dadong band leader in dance halls, was accused of forgery. The case was transferred to the District Court for trial yesterday after the District Attorney's Office filed a public prosecution. Cao Zuwei, the judge in charge of the case, scheduled the trial to be held on the 16th. Last July, Chen told Huang Gang that he had 1,200 bottles of foreign wine that he wanted to sell for US$1 per bottle. Huang believed it to be true and paid US$1,200 to order the wine. However, Chen never delivered the foreign wine. Dragging on until February of this year, Huang asked for the money back. Chen issued a check for 168 million yuan in legal tender from the Allied Bank, but it was returned due to insufficient funds. Subsequently, Shi Bimen, the manager of Wanguo Savings Association, came forward to mediate and issued a check for 450 million yuan in legal tender from the Mainland Bank, but it was also returned. Huang Gang believed that Chen had deliberately defrauded him and filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office accusing Chen of "forgery."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Mediate Fish Market Disputes; Fisheries Administration Massively Dumps Goods, Private Businesses Unable to Survive</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The situation where disputes have arisen due to the Fisheries Administration of the Executive Yuan dumping fish caught by relief fishing vessels, causing sluggish sales, has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is understood that the cause of this matter is that a month ago, various private fishing companies, seeing that the fishing vessels of the Executive Yuan were equipped with new equipment, caught fish quickly, and delivered large quantities, causing fish prices to plummet, requested that the Fisheries Administration of the Executive Yuan reduce the amount of goods unloaded. However, the Fisheries Administration stated that it was technically impossible to reduce the quantity of goods shipped and that it was also unable to expand sales to other places besides Shanghai, so it expressed its unwillingness to accept the request.</p>
<p>Subsequently, as the losses of the various private fishing companies accumulated, they again approached the Fisheries Administration for negotiations. After several discussions, it was decided that from November, the Fisheries Administration's fishing vessels would unload no more than 350,000 catties per month in principle. According to the Fisheries Administration, if shipments were limited to this amount, only six or seven fishing vessels per month would be sufficient to supply the market. If the remaining fishing vessels remained berthed at Fuxing Island and were unable to unload their catch, the cost of continuous refrigeration would be unbearable. Regarding the rumors of disturbances in recent days, it is said that because the private fishing companies delivered too many goods, the fish market obtained the Fisheries Administration's consent to temporarily suspend the unloading of the Executive Yuan's fish. However, as of last night, all the fish from the Executive Yuan in the fish market had been completely unloaded. The rumors that some of the fish and the Executive Yuan's fish had rotted are not untrue, as the new refrigeration equipment on the Executive Yuan's fishing vessels can preserve the freshness of fish for more than two years. According to the private companies, each fishing trip costs them about 300 million yuan per boat. If the Fisheries Administration engages in unrestricted dumping, affecting fish prices, they will be unable to survive. Therefore, they urgently hope that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry can quickly negotiate with the Executive Yuan to rationalize production and sales, so that, on the one hand, private fishing companies can survive, and on the other hand, the food supply for the people will not be affected.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in order to resolve the Shanghai fish market problem, has dispatched personnel to Shanghai on the night train on the 10th to mediate.</p>

<h3>Seven Merchants Arrested, Rice Market Briefly Stalled, Resumed After Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the Municipal Police Bureau, acting on orders, dispatched the Economic Police Brigade to monitor transactions in various markets throughout the day. The general situation was good. The Southern Rice Market was briefly stalled due to the arrest of seven rice merchants who were illegally raising prices: Chen Meizhang (Yuanchang), Zhang Yuanyi (Taishan), Li Boxiang (Yongchun), Yang Baofeng (Changfengtai), Li Yongyuan (Tiantai De), and Zhu Guiqing (Zhu Guiji). After negotiations between market officials and the police bureau, who agreed to continue trading in accordance with the order not to exceed 800,000 yuan per shi, the police bureau released the seven individuals. At the same time, the seven rice shops sold all 475 shi of white rice they had purchased at the limited price. In addition, when the oil market opened in the morning, there was unrest because the oil mills had stopped selling. After Zhang Chao, the chairman of the Oil Industry Association, requested the oil mills to allocate 3,000 dan of edible oil directly to retailers at a fair price, the situation stabilized.</p>
<h3>Jurisdiction Over Pilotage to be Taken Over Ahead of Schedule; Customs Strikers to be Re-examined and Re-employed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over pilotage in this city, since the foreign pilots of the Customs went on strike and the Chinese pilots of the Tongsha Association requested that the Customs transfer the jurisdiction, originally scheduled for January 1 next year, to the Maritime Administration Bureau ahead of schedule, the Ministry of Transportation immediately consulted with the Ministry of Finance.

The Ministry of Finance has agreed that the Maritime Administration Bureau will take over jurisdiction over pilotage ahead of schedule. The date of the transfer will be decided after consultation between the Maritime Administration Bureau and the Customs. 2. The 22 Customs pilots who went on strike and wish to return to work will be individually reviewed by the Maritime Administration Bureau and re-employed as new employees. 3. The White Russian pilots temporarily employed by the Customs will be retained until the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Foreign Pilots Must Join Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Maritime Administration Bureau told reporters that the bureau would soon negotiate with the Customs about the handover, which is expected to be completed before the 20th of this month. The Customs currently has four large pilot boats, three small boats, and other pilotage equipment, which will all be handed over. After the Maritime Administration Bureau takes over, the pilotage affairs will be the responsibility of the Tongsha Pilot Association. The association currently has 18 Chinese pilots. Foreign pilots who wish to work in the future must also join the association and be subject to its control. The pilotage rights, which have been in the hands of foreigners for a century, can now be completely recovered. It is also learned that the pilotage fees may be increased after the Maritime Administration Bureau takes over.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Year-End Bonus Issue: Representatives Elected to Negotiate in Beijing; More Than Twenty Proposals Passed at Yesterday's Congress</h3>

<h3>Taiwan Strives for Equal Treatment</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter interviewed the male and female representatives from the Taiwan Provincial Postal District. Taiwan Province still uses the joint postal and telecommunications system from the Japanese occupation period. There are currently more than 7,000 postal and telecommunications employees. Under the Japanese colonial policy, Taiwanese employees were not allowed to form unions, their treatment was extremely low, and they were all assigned to positions below the intermediate level. Under the current price situation in Taiwan, their income is insufficient to provide personal sustenance. Therefore, many postal workers engage in side jobs such as pulling rickshaws and selling cigarettes in their spare time. Therefore, the most important task of the Taiwanese representatives this time is to strive for equal treatment, request "reclassification," hold qualification examinations, and employ and pay salaries according to the domestic system. The plight of Taiwanese postal workers has received widespread sympathy at the congress. Representative Zhang Mei Wang told this reporter: Returning to the motherland for the first time is like returning to the embrace of parents. Our domestic brothers and sisters are treating us so well.</p>
<h3>Two Major Drug Trafficking Cases Cracked, Several Police Officers Involved Receive Commendations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] On the 30th of last month, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Bureau cracked down on a drug manufacturing operation at No. 12, Ruihua Fang, Jianguo Middle Road, arresting Li Linsheng (also known as Peng) and Hu Kunlin (also known as Mao Kun) on the spot, and confiscating two catties and five liang of heroin. Afterwards, officers were dispatched to guard the location and arrested Wang Changjun, Zheng Shunhai, Wang Zhang Ezhen, Liu Wenying, Wang Jin'e, Li Amao, and six others. Based on their confessions, they arrested accomplices Xie Yizhong, Kong Deyao, and Xu Fuxing at No. 34 of the same lane, and confiscated two liang of caffeine and two qian of heroin. According to their confessions, the source of the drugs was transported from Tianjin by sea and air. The usual contact point was at a certain law firm at No. 308, Shude Lane, Yunnan South Road. The police bureau, as the criminals have confessed to producing and selling drugs, has scheduled to transfer them to the court for interrogation today. The police officers involved in this operation, including Chief Zhu Mengwei, officers Chen Xianrong, Ma Feimu, and staff member Ding Wenyang, have been ordered by Director Yu to receive commendations. Furthermore, the Lao Zha Volunteer Criminal Brigade of the Volunteer Criminal Corps received a tip at 5 PM on the 9th that a large number of illegal drug traffickers were hiding in Room 19 of the Xin Risheng Hotel on Wuhu Road. They immediately reported to Branch Director Shi Si, who ordered Team Leader Jiang Shangpei and Huang Zheng, the internal team leader, to lead officers together with Tang Zhiliang, an officer from the Second Section, to rush to the address around 11 PM that day. They entered Room 19 and searched, finally discovering about 50 liang of heroin inside a specially made vest worn by Ding Hexuan.

<h3>Municipal Relief Sculpture of Fuzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou 6th Dispatch] Fuzhou is a port in southern China. From an economic and geographical standpoint, Fuzhou has almost become a hub for the inflow and outflow of goods from more than a dozen prosperous counties along the Min River. Imports are mainly cotton cloth, flour, and rice, followed by paper, cotton yarn, fertilizer, and vegetable oil, and then followed by soybean cakes, hardware, and electrical appliances, and beans. Exports are mainly tea, wood, and paper, followed by sugar, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts, and fresh and dried fruits, followed by paper umbrellas, lacquerware, horn combs, fish and seafood. Imports are mostly agricultural products and daily necessities for urban dwellers, while exports are mainly special products. From wartime to the post-war period, according to Customs reports, the trade balance has almost always been in a deficit. Although there was a brief trade surplus in June and July of this year, the trade situation has not been reversed.</p>
<p>Port Trade</p>
<p>The trend of prosperous trade in Fuzhou largely depends on the smooth flow of port transportation. Fujian still has no railway line extending into the interior, which is a major reason why Fuzhou Port is too weak. Secondly, the lack of timely dredging and embankment treatment of the Min River hinders the smooth flow of shipping. The section of the Min River from Nanping to Shuikou is full of reefs, and there are more than twenty dangerous areas. In the lower reaches, silt and sand accumulate, and the riverbed rises daily. Before the war, giant ships of several thousand tons could directly reach the Taijiang city area. Now, because the water is shallow, they are blocked at the Mazhou Star Pagoda. Cargoes are transferred to small boats for loading and unloading, which greatly increases labor costs. Such transportation only increases the cost of imports and exports. To prosper Fuzhou, it is necessary to improve the current state of stagnation in port transportation. The Ministry of Transportation is already planning to build the Min-Gan Railway. Dredging the downstream waterways of the Min River is an urgent task. It is heard that the Provincial Government is raising funds to purchase dredging equipment and build new-style wharves and warehouses. All of these are important policies for the prosperity of the Fuzhou commercial port and are sufficient to affect the prosperity or decline of the Fuzhou economy. In his industrialization plan, President Sun Yat-sen designated Fuzhou as a second-class port and planned to regulate the downstream waters of the Min River to a depth of 30 feet so that 10,000-ton ships could pass through smoothly, which is sufficient to demonstrate the value of Fuzhou Port.</p>
<p>Industry, Commerce, and Agriculture</p>
<p>Fuzhou's industry is still in the handicraft stage and can be divided into two major sectors: special product processing and technical works. The former includes sawing wood, milling rice, papermaking, and tea picking, while the latter includes lacquerware, paper umbrellas, horn combs, carvings, and daily necessities such as weaving and leather. The only heavy industry is the Fudien Iron Factory. The transportation and sale of special products from northwestern Fujian is an important part of Fuzhou's commerce. Before the war, merchants gathered from all over and the scene was quite prosperous. After the war, due to difficulties in transportation and sales, rising labor costs, and a sharp increase in costs, coupled with the turbulent situation and sluggish sales, the financial market tightened and high-interest loans became popular. The Fujian Agricultural and Forestry Company, which is known for its special product operations, suffered operational losses due to difficulty in exporting, which is indicative of the situation.</p>
<p>Regarding agricultural production, Fuzhou City only has 3,000 municipal acres of cultivated land, and the output of agricultural crops is very small. The city has a population of more than 330,000, and its daily food requirement is more than 2,000 shi, mostly relying on imports from other ports. According to official reports, last year, 264,000 municipal shi of rice, 528,000 municipal shi of rice, and 48,000 municipal dan of wheat flour were imported. Fuzhou can hardly do without external assistance for a day.</p>
<p>Public Utilities</p>
<p>Electricity is the largest public utility in Fuzhou. The Fuzhou Electric Company has four generators with a capacity of less than 5,000 kilowatts. Because the equipment of the Electric Company has passed its expiration date, it is often damaged. Electricity cannot be supplied during the day, and power outages often occur in different areas at night. Fuzhou still has no tap water equipment. Residents rely on wells for drinking water. Every spring and summer, floods cause disasters. Ditch water flows back, and the well water becomes turbid. As a result, epidemics are bound to be prevalent every year. "Water" is a major problem for Fuzhou's municipal engineering. The Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company previously had a plan to invest in establishing a Fuzhou water plant, but the funds required were too large, and this matter is still pending. The temporary solution lies in disinfecting drinking water. The Municipal Government and the General Branch of the Union Bank jointly run seven drinking water disinfection supply stations, one of which has been completed, using new water purification machines to provide clean water for citizens.</p>
<p>The traffic in Fuzhou City is mainly based on buses. There are only 30 buses in the city, running on three lines. The vehicles are not sufficient for distribution. After the South Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company took over the Fuzhou Public Bus Company, it is heard that they plan to expand to smooth out the traffic in the city area.</p>
<p>Municipal Problems</p>
<p>The financial problem is actually an economic problem. After the war, Fuzhou's industry and commerce declined, and the economic situation was very different from the past. Under this depressed situation, the city government's tax revenue has not improved despite repeated reorganizations. Financial constraints make it difficult to cook without rice. How can we talk about innovation while holding on to the old ways?</p>
<p>Food is the most difficult issue for the city government to deal with. Fuzhou is a purely consuming place. Rice and grain are entirely reliant on aid from northern Fujian or overseas. The city government does not have the financial resources to purchase large quantities of food from the producing areas to supply the fair-price market, while grain merchants have the financial resources to manipulate grain prices and confront the city government. Seasonal fluctuations in grain prices are like a "malignant disease" plaguing the municipal authorities. Mayor Yan Lingfeng is a municipal worker with魄力 and confidence. When he often discusses general municipal issues in Fuzhou with reporters, he always looks forward to the future of Fuzhou with optimism. His attitude is sincere and 겸충, and he has a sincere dedication to serving his hometown. He integrates local and 情 with no intervals.</p>
<p>Fuzhou is a very promising city. It has the Min River, which acts as a 교통動맥, a warm climate, a natural good harbor, and widespread education. If the transportation situation can be gradually improved, then prosperity can be expected, and the responsibility to revive its commercial status in South China lies with the municipal authorities and requires continuous effort from the municipal authorities.

<h3>Minister Ying Qianli of the Ministry of Education's Social Education Department Discusses Educational Film Plans: 22 Films to Be Produced This Year to Improve Social Education in Border Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 10th] Minister Ying Qianli of the Ministry of Education's Social Education Department, speaking to reporters on the 10th about the future plans of the Central Educational Film Studio, stated: (A) Construction: It is planned to expand offices and technical rooms, and build staff dormitories to facilitate work. (B) Equipment: Building an indoor scene stage, improving sound recording and film processing equipment, and installing water and electrical equipment. Equipment already purchased in the United States includes the latest model of high-quality 16mm cameras, which have not yet been seen in China and are not widely used even in American factories. The entire set of equipment and accessories is complete. The entire set of sound recording equipment is also the newest and most complete product from the United States, with all parts in stock. Film processing equipment has been purchased in the United States. It is automatic and has photosensitive testing equipment (to determine the scientific standards for film production and processing), as well as photosensitive materials. Some of the above equipment and materials have already arrived in Shanghai, and most are en route.</p>
<p>Sixteen Millimeter Film</p>
<p>(C) Future Productions: It is planned to focus on producing 16mm films because the current trend is to use 16mm projectors more than 35mm projectors, and this will be even more so in the future. Moreover, the equipment for producing 16mm films is lighter and more convenient than 35mm equipment, and 16mm film is less flammable, making it easier to promote. 35mm film is inherently a gunpowder, posing a great danger. The reason why 16mm films were not widely promoted in the past was that the quality was inferior and the technology was not yet perfect. Now, after mutual improvements by various manufacturers, the weight of a 16mm film projector is only 20 pounds, the light source can reach 1000 watts, and the sound can reach 10 watts. Future production standards will focus on popularizing them among schools and community groups at all levels, with 16mm films being the main focus. 35mm films will be aimed at theaters, with only one film of greater value being produced each year. It is also planned to organize a strong screenwriting department to write meaningful scripts for other film studios each year to alleviate the shortage of script drafts in domestic film studios. In addition, it is planned to produce a large number of still films, including still roll films and still single films, to improve the knowledge level of all national schools and farmers across the country. The technique of still films is quite similar to comic strips, and each time a film is produced, a comic book will also be released for public education.</p>
<p>Subject Matter Divided into Three Parts</p>
<p>(D) The subject matter of the films can be divided into three parts: extracurricular education, including the current situation in China and the global situation; materials to complement courses and levels of education; and general publicity reports and dramas. Although the studio has several years of history, during the Anti-Japanese War, it was limited by equipment, and its film production technology was naturally immature, and its understanding of and connection with educational undertakings was also far from ideal. Now that it has moved east to Nanjing, it is striving to enrich and improve itself. In the future, it hopes that the press will provide more guidance to the studio, and especially hopes that the academic and educational circles will cooperate more. As for various business organizations, it would be sincerely welcomed if they wish to jointly produce related films with the studio. The studio's biggest task this year is to improve social education in the border areas, remake ten existing educational films, and specially produce twelve more, totaling twenty-two films, for use in the border areas. The content includes China's "History and Geography," "Industry," "Transportation," "National Defense," etc., and will be dubbed in Mandarin, Uyghur, Mongolian, and Tibetan to help border residents recognize them.</p>

<h3>Former President of Fudan University, Li Denghui, Praised by the National Government</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 10th] The National Government has issued an order praising former Fudan University President Li Denghui. The original text is as follows: "Li Denghui, former President of Fudan University, lived overseas from a young age, caring about the motherland and aspiring to restore it. Later, he entered Yale University in the United States, studying literature, philosophy, and other subjects. He believed in revitalizing customs and promoting education first. After returning to China, he founded the World's Chinese Students' Federation and Fudan University, taking the promotion of culture and the training of future generations as his mission. Throughout his life, he firmly believed in religion, integrating Chinese and Western scholarship and returning to it. He cultivated himself and established others, indifferent to official advancement. The government repeatedly tried to recruit him, but ultimately could not. His students are spread throughout the country, each with their own achievements. In the midst of repeated major changes and various dangers, his virtue of integrity and his upright conduct remained unchanged. He bore the heavy expectations of the contemporary era and was admired by scholars for more than forty years. Just as we hoped that the country would have experienced leaders and always have models to emulate, we heard of his sudden illness and passing away. Recalling his venerable virtue, we are deeply saddened. He should be praised by a clear order, and his life's deeds should be sent to the National History Museum to highlight his integrity and to show future generations. This order!"</p>

In the last four minutes, they were still down 36 to 41. Captain Jia Zhijun turned the tide, scoring ten consecutive points and reversing the defeat. The audience of 2,000 made the Municipal Gymnasium quite lively. In the first half, Renyu led 24 to 22 by two points. Ziqi captain Jia Zhijun was the soul of the team, and Yu Ruizhang's assistance was very helpful. The team still lacked short passes and moves under the basket during the game. Xu Zhongji and Yao Wen[blank] of Renyu were the most outstanding. The battle situation was as follows: The starting lineup for the 16th Transportation Corps was Yu Ruizhang, Liao Dihang, Jia Zhijun, Wang Shixuan, and Liu Zhengjun.

<h3>First Impression of the Sixteenth Transportation Corps: Simple and Unpretentious Style</h3>
<p>[Special Article] The sixteenth Transportation Corps basketball team created a miracle in their first game in Shanghai: narrowly winning over Renyu despite being at a disadvantage throughout the game.</p>
<p>The visiting team, apart from borrowing Yu Ruizhang and Liu Zhengjun from "Zhenshu," only fielded: Wang Shixuan, Jia Zhijun, Zheng Dagang, [blank] Dihang, and Gan Rongwu. Jia Zhijun was the only one who could be called an all-around player. Zheng Dagang had surprising speed and quick shots, and Wang Shixuan relied solely on experience.</p>
<p>Renyu has many talented shooters and flashy moves to trick their opponents. The visiting team was initially at a loss. The Sixteenth Transportation Corps' tactics were simple and unpretentious, and their passing skills were far inferior to the home team. In the first half, many passes were intercepted by Renyu.</p>
<p>The visiting team's reason for reversing the defeat was only two points: In the second half, no one guarded Jia Zhijun's offense, and Renyu's stamina was not as good as the visiting team's. Sun Guozheng was fouled out, and the situation changed from being controlled by Renyu to being balanced. The visiting team took the opportunity to use quick shots to seize victory.</p>
<p>For the next few games, unless there are special reasons, in my personal opinion, the Sixteenth Transportation Corps still needs to work hard. (Changnian)</p>

<h3>After the Issuance of Large Denomination Notes: Credit Tightening, Strict Prevention: Minimal Price Fluctuations: Financial Circles Express Need to Pay Attention to the Lunar New Year Period</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank issued large denomination notes of 1,000 and 2,000 Customs Gold yesterday, and the market situation was very stable. Prices of securities and some goods even fell. Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun hosted reporters yesterday afternoon and stated that there were no price fluctuations after the issuance of large denomination notes. The Financial Management Bureau will be formally established today and will resolutely and strictly inspect and crack down on speculation. National banks are also tightening credit. Yesterday, the difference in intake reached over 100 billion, and today the goods tax alone will add another 40 billion yuan. 43,000 tons of rice and a large amount of flour will arrive at ports soon and will be distributed and sold separately. In addition, remittance restrictions are in place. The Four Banks Joint Treasury has temporarily completely stopped lending. Therefore, the future of finance and prices is considered to be worry-free.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the issuance of 1,000 and 2,000 Customs Gold notes yesterday, market prices rose sharply in the morning due to popular sentiment, and the market was slightly chaotic, but quickly fell back, not far from the prices of the previous day. Taking the stock market as an example, the opening was high. Yongsha's off-exchange price reached 440, and the on-exchange price also reached 427, but short sellers took advantage of the high price to sell, causing the selling price to plummet, falling to the 400 mark by the noon closing. The foreign exchange market also fluctuated in the morning, but by noon, it was very little different from the previous day.</p>
<p>Price Curve Moving Upward, Prevention Cannot Be Relaxed</p>
<p>According to the analysis of financial circles, the reason why prices did not fluctuate greatly after the issuance of large denomination notes is due to the government's strict prevention in all aspects. In addition to tightening credit, it is also strictly monitoring hoarding. At the same time, the current number of large denomination notes issued is very small, so its impact is not very significant. However, what we must pay attention to is that the price curve is always moving upward, and all measures only have the effect of delaying. It is expected that the large-scale issuance of these two new Customs Gold notes will not be today but around the Lunar New Year to meet the needs of year-end bonuses and other needs. At that time, if there is no appropriate prevention, prices will change dramatically, and the full impact of large denomination notes can be estimated at that time. In addition, the percentage increase in various prices yesterday is difficult to accurately measure because everything is still in a state of flux, and various commodities are not uniform. It is generally believed that it will take two or three days for everything to return to a stable state before an estimate can be made.</p>
<p>National Banks Convene Meeting to Suspend Payment of Various Loans</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Central Bank Vice President Liu, in view of the issuance of large denomination notes, believed that emergency measures should be taken for the business of national banks. Therefore, he specially convened the heads of various banks yesterday morning to hold a temporary meeting. After discussing it, it was decided: All items that should not be paid will be temporarily suspended. All loans will be completely stopped, including important loans such as cotton and flour. For public agencies and state-owned enterprises with deposits of over 200 million yuan, the maximum daily payment is limited to 200 million. Remittances of over 200 million yuan from various places will also be temporarily suspended, and the source of the remittances will be investigated. It is reported that the decision is purely to cooperate with the government's policy in order to tighten credit and stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Slightly Recover</h3>
<p>Public bonds were bought yesterday, stimulated by the issuance of large denomination notes. Unified Bond C opened in the morning at 25,700 yuan, from 25,250 yuan, gradually rising to around 28,000 yuan and then stabilizing slightly. A and B rose from 17,000 yuan to 18,500 yuan and then also stabilized. Compared with the previous closing, A and B rose by 1,900, C rose by 2,300, D rose by 1,700, and E also improved by 1,600.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks slightly recovered after preparation. Hong Kong [blank] fell, and off-exchange black market prices fell sharply after a high. After active buying, the market was eventually forced down due to excessive inventory. Yisha saw over 400,000 off-exchange at the morning opening, and English League reached a high of over 550,000, then fell back to a low of 385,000 yuan and then stabilized, compared with the previous closing. Telephone and Tramway were still flat, rubber stocks fell by 10%, Jardine Matheson, beer, paper, shipping, and steel each fell by 5%, Yisha and English League fell slightly, and Xiangtai rose slightly.</p>
<p>Six Types of Government Bonds Drawn Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance drew lots yesterday morning in Shanghai for the redemption of six types of government bonds, including Unified E, Relief, and Construction. 1. Eighteen Unified Government Bond E tickets were drawn, totaling 4.68 million yuan. 2. Twelve Republic of China 27th Year Relief Government Bond tickets were drawn, totaling 360,000 yuan. 3.

<h3>Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Suggests Two Points to the Textile Regulation Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association held its 95th executive committee meeting yesterday. Important reports included the association's issuance of notices and forms for inventory cotton and production reports, instructing all colleagues to fill them out immediately and send them to the association within this week for compilation and submission to the Textile Regulation Committee.</p>
<p>Association Chairman Wang Qiyu and executive directors Liu Jingji and Rong Yixin visited Textile Regulation Committee Chairman Yuan Liang yesterday. Wang and others suggested two points: The supply of raw cotton should be timed, quantitative, and qualitative to avoid production interruptions. Regarding the new policy on cotton yarn and cloth, the government should be reasonable and fair and not hinder agricultural and industrial production. It is reported that Yuan said that he would do his best to be reasonable and fair, but the raw cotton supply method is still being planned.</p>
<p>The association will hold a tea party this Saturday afternoon to invite Chairman Yuan to listen to opinions on the control of cotton yarn.</p>
<h3>Credit Tight</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Credit was tight yesterday, with private interest rates reaching 24%. The four banks and two bureaus had a difference of 101.9 billion. The Central Bank entered 63.5 billion, the big exchange entered 59.6 billion, foreign merchants entered 66.2 billion, the small exchange exited 108.5 billion, and China entered 37.1 billion.</p>

<h3>Solid Export Tea</h3>
<p>Domestic tea remains active all day due to unabated demand, similar to the previous day. As for the foreign tea market, sellers continue to hold out for higher prices, while exporters, though interested, are reluctant to offer high bids. Consequently, negotiations are difficult, resulting in fewer transactions, but the market sentiment remains firm.</p>
<h3>Large Supply of Yarn from the China Textile Construction Corporation and the Textile Adjustment Committee - Gauze Prices Initially High, Then Decline - Cloth Prices Rise, Raw Cotton Transactions Scarce</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, due to the initial issuance of the new Customs Gold Unit notes, the China Textile Construction Corporation and the Textile Adjustment Committee sold large quantities of yarn to stabilize the silk gauze market. The China Textile Construction Corporation sold a total of 17,122 bales of yarn of various counts, equivalent to 2,802.5 bales of 20-count yarn. In addition to allocating yarn to local weaving businesses, it also allocated it to weaving businesses in various counties outside the city. The price, based on 20-count yarn, remained at 28.11 million yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Textile Adjustment Committee opened yarn sales in the cotton yarn market, resulting in the sale of 1,623 bales, equivalent to 2,126 bales of 20-count yarn. The prices were 15.4 million yuan for 6-count yarn, 30.5 million yuan for 20-count yarn, 39.5 million yuan for 32-count yarn, 42.5 million yuan for 42-count yarn, and 48.5 million yuan for 42-count doubled yarn.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the cotton yarn market yesterday initially saw optimistic sentiment due to the issuance of large denomination banknotes, and prices generally rose. Subsequently, because the China Textile Construction Corporation kept its allocated yarn prices unchanged and increased the quantity, the money supply in the market tightened, leading to widespread selling. Scatter sales were more common than bundled sales, and the market showed a slight softening. However, at the close of the afternoon session, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose by 500,000 yuan from the previous day to 49.2 million yuan, while other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. The cotton cloth market opened with positive sentiment in the morning, which then became very active, and market prices were generally raised. Around 10:30 AM, market supervisors arrived to monitor trading, and transactions became scarce. As the money supply tightened, prices fell from their highs. However, the final prices of 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloth yarns were still 20,000 to 50,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Throughout the day, 190 Shilin cloth rose by 50,000 to 150,000 yuan due to dye and factory prices, while bleached cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, and raw cloth were absorbed by buyers, rising by 120,000-130,000 to 500,000-600,000 yuan. Only jige and straight weave fabrics remained stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, raw cotton transactions were scarce, with sellers holding out for high prices and buyers adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Asking prices were very high, making it difficult for buyers and sellers to agree, resulting in a quiet market with only 300 bales traded.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Commodity Prices in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Wuxi [Special Dispatch from Wuxi, 10th] Commodity prices here have been affected by the large denomination banknotes.

Fragrant yellow goods, general merchandise, and grains are all soaring in price, but the money supply remains tight.</p>
<h3>Large Banknote Stimulation is Slight - Shanghai Stocks Rise Initially, Then Decline Sharply</h3>
<p>Shanghai stocks rose initially yesterday, then declined sharply. The stimulus from the large denomination banknotes only caused some initial buying interest. Government authorities released large quantities of various materials, tightening the money supply. Guangdong, Nanjing, and securities groups sold heavily, leading to low volume at the close. In the morning, Changli was very active, and Yong Yarn opened high, rising half a percentage point. Datong, China Textile, and underwear stocks traded at 424 yuan for immediate delivery, 427 yuan for forward delivery, 432 yuan for immediate delivery bought, and 43 yuan for forward delivery at a high price.

After slight selling, it reached 412 yuan and 413 yuan. Although there was a slight rebound afterwards, the tight money supply caused widespread panic, and there were rumors of borrowing. All parties were extremely cautious. Forward delivery stocks broke the 400 yuan barrier in the afternoon, falling to 398 yuan, and forward delivery stocks saw a low of 401 yuan. The afternoon close was 401 yuan and 403 yuan, with asking prices remaining low after the close. As a result, apart from miscellaneous stocks with sluggish trading, all stocks felt bleak and dim, with immediate delivery stocks falling by a total of one-tenth compared to the previous close. Zhabei, Jingfu, Qinxing, French, Xinhua, Match, and Mountain Silk stocks each fell by half a percentage point. China Rise, New Light, Xinyu, Meiya, Yonggong, and Zhongxing stocks remained flat, while the rest fell slightly. Among forward delivery stocks, Huayi and Qinxing fell by half a percentage point, while the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the after-market, only immediate delivery trades were conducted. The market was initially stable, then retreated from 406 yuan to 401 yuan. Although it briefly rose to 414 yuan, there was a significant difference in the government's advance, and there was a large amount of cutting long positions outside the market. Major securities firms sold heavily, breaking the 400 yuan barrier again and falling to 397 yuan. The closing price was 397 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Huayi and China Silk stocks each rose by about half a percentage point, Liana fell by half a percentage point, Jingfu, Xin'guang, Xinhua, Jinglun, Match, and Tongyi remained flat, Zhabei, Qinxing, French, New Asia, Guohuo, and Rongfeng rose slightly, and Yong Yarn, Gai Xin, Xinyu, Meiya, Yonggong, Underwear, and China Textile fell slightly.

<p>By Will Durant, The Story of Civilization, Simon and Schuster, New York, First Edition 1942, 1048 pages, US$6.00</p>
<p>Recently, I read two major works on world cultural history at home: one is British historian Toynbee's "A Study of History," and the other is American Durant's "The Story of Civilization." The former is a study of the philosophy of history, divided into thirteen parts, with six large volumes already published, only reaching the fifth part of the entire book. I plan to introduce it in another article. Durant's "The Story of Civilization" narrates world cultural history, divided into five parts, with only three large volumes published, only covering Eastern civilization and cultures before the Western classical era. This spirit of devoting all one's energy and concentration to a specific field of work is truly admirable and makes us feel ashamed. Chinese society does not cultivate research talents in specialized academic fields. On the contrary, it cripples them. The lack of a material foundation, the corruption of social customs, and the involvement of political factors cause many scholars to use their knowledge improperly, spending their days busy with many inexplicable things, ultimately achieving nothing and wasting their lives. I use this to criticize myself and also hope to encourage others.</p>
<p>Durant is known for "The Story of Philosophy." General readers often regard philosophical books as difficult and abstruse and dare not attempt to read them. However, Durant's "The Story of Philosophy" has clear and elegant writing and clear reasoning, elucidating theories from the life stories of philosophers, making it easy to understand. Therefore, that book still sells very well and is widely circulated. More than thirty years ago, the author wanted to start writing a "History of the Nineteenth Century," but he found that such work was impossible without thoroughly tracing back to the beginning of human history. So he planned to write a large world cultural history, which includes five parts:</p>
<p>Eastern Culture: Narrates the cultures of Egypt and the Near East until the fall of Alexandria; the cultures of India, China, and Japan up to the present. The introduction explains the nature and factors of culture.</p>
<p>Classical Culture: Narrates the cultures of Greece and Rome and the Near Eastern cultures under Greek and Roman rule.</p>
<p>Medieval Culture: Narrates European culture under Catholicism and feudalism, Byzantine culture, Islamic and Jewish culture in Asia, Africa, and Spain, and the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p>European Culture: Narrates the cultural history of European countries from the Reformation to the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Modern Culture: Narrates the development of Europe in politics, science, philosophy, religion, morality, literature, and art since Napoleon's time.</p>
<p>The first part began in 1927 and was completed and published in 1935. By 1942, it had sold to the eighth edition. The edition I read is the eighth edition, and this article can only briefly introduce the contents of this book. In the preface to this book, the author says: "I want to describe as much as possible mankind's contributions to culture in the fewest possible words. We must trace the causes and consequences of all historical events, the progress of various inventions, the changes in economic organization, the changes in political systems, the upheavals in religious beliefs, the sudden creations in moral customs, the creations in literature and art, and the development of scientific philosophy." In the past, those who wrote cultural history always liked to divide it into economic history, political history, religious history, philosophical history, literary history, scientific history, etc., and then divide it into many eras. This inevitably leads to the drawbacks of fragmented branches. Human life is whole, so human cultural history should be a complete narrative, whether in breadth or depth. Of course, because the development of human life in various aspects is too complex and too specialized, if one person makes a comprehensive description, there will inevitably be biases, omissions, and errors. However, we cannot ignore the need for human beings to have a comprehensive and complete understanding of their own culture.</p>
<p>This book is exclusively about Eastern culture and is only one-fifth of "The Story of Civilization." This book is further divided into three volumes. It begins with an introduction, discussing "The Establishment of Culture," divided into six chapters: The Conditions of Culture (including the basic conditions of geology, geography, economy, race, and psychology); The Economic Factors of Culture (including 1. From nomadic to agricultural; 2. Industrial basis, 2. Economic organization)! The Political Factors of Culture - the origin of government, the state, law, family; The Moral Factors of Culture - relations between the sexes, social customs, religious beliefs; The Psychological Factors of Culture - language! Writing, science, art; The Origin of Prehistoric Culture.</p>
<p>The first volume is on Near Eastern culture, describing the economic life, political situation, religious morality, language and literature, and philosophical thought of Sumeria, Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Judah, Persia, and other countries.</p>
<p>The second volume is on the cultural history of India, divided into nine chapters: The Foundation of India; Buddha Shakyamuni; From Alexander to Aurangzeb! The Life of the Indian People (including its economic life, social organization, moral marriage, customs); The Divine Realm (explaining the divine realms of Hinduism, Buddhism, and various strange beliefs; Indian Schools of Thought; Indian Literature (including language, education, poetry, drama, etc.); Indian Art (including music, printing, sculpture, architecture, etc.), Christianity in India (which specifically mentions Tagore and Gandhi).</p>
<p>The third volume is on the culture of the Far East, including China and Japan. Regarding the Chinese part, he calls the Zhou Dynasty the era of thinkers, discussing the ancient culture of China and then talking about the philosophy of Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Yang Zhu. He calls the Qin, Han, and Tang Dynasties the era of poets, with Li Bai and Du Fu as representatives. He also calls the Song Dynasty and later the era of artists, discussing Chinese bronzes, ceramics, calligraphy, pagodas, and palaces. Then there are two chapters: one is a general discussion of the Chinese people and the state; the other is on China's revolution and rebirth. Regarding the Japanese part, he talks about the creators of Japan, the political and moral foundations of Japan, the traditional Japanese thought and art, and the last chapter talks about the reforms of new Japan in industry and culture since the Meiji Restoration, all the way to the relationship between the United States and Japan. The author wrote this book before the Pearl Harbor incident. He believes that the United States does not necessarily have to fight Japan. He said: "We have taught Japan the industrialized technology, enabling Japan to succeed in the East Asian economic competition. There is no need to worry about the power of the Japanese. The world is so big that the United States and Japan can coexist. The Pacific Ocean is so vast that there is plenty of room for peaceful coexistence." I wonder if Durant had a feeling of "If I don't destroy Japan, Japan will destroy me" when the Pearl Harbor incident suddenly broke out on December 8th?</p>
<p>Regarding the rebirth of China, the author offers much encouragement, which deeply benefits Chinese readers. He says: "Military and economic victories cannot permanently control China. When the invaders are exhausted, this oriental essence will remain undamaged. Foreign rule will be assimilated by it in a century. China will soon be familiar with everything called modern industry. Transportation roads will make her unified; economic thrift will make her wealthy; a strong government will make her peaceful. All the chaos is a transitional phenomenon... Revolution is the death of decay. Revolution occurs because many things should be eliminated. How many times has China died, but how many times has she been reborn!" Reading this passage and recalling Weidmaier's severe criticism of China's current situation is truly laughable.</p>
<p>The author, Dr. Durant, studied philosophy under Dewey at Columbia University and taught at his alma mater. His English is fluent, and his reasoning is rich in literary flavor. Even a book of more than a thousand pages does not tire the reader. I very much hope that someone from Chinese academic and ideological circles will translate it, which will be beneficial to the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Industry is Developing</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>Taiwan, which was lost for fifty-one years, has returned to the embrace of the motherland. This returning child not only brings the warmth of human feelings but also brings a large amount of property. As the motherland has undergone eight years of war, and everywhere is devastated, this property is very valuable. It is generally believed that the construction of Taiwan is an unexpected gain for us. In fact, this was not left by the Japanese, but is the result of the fifty-one years of sweat and blood of the Taiwanese people, and we must cherish it all the more.</p>
<p>Taiwan spans the tropical and subtropical latitudes, with a mild climate, abundant rainfall, fertile land, and abundant products. Rice can be harvested twice a year, and in the early Qing Dynasty, there was surplus grain that could be transported to the mainland. In addition, sugar, tea, aquatic products, and camphor and other products were also transported back to the motherland. Therefore, trade between Taiwan and the motherland was quite prosperous in the early years. After the Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was ceded to Japan. The Japanese, seeing that Taiwan was fertile and had more than three million Taiwanese people who could be driven by them, actively developed it. Within a few years, the results were quite impressive, and it became Japan's outer province, allowing it to be exploited and squeezed without end.</p>
<p>When the Japanese managed Taiwan, they always adopted a policy of agriculture in Taiwan and industry in Japan, so industry was not highly developed. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to the needs of Japanese military affairs and Taiwan itself, various industries gradually arose. Even heavy industries such as metallurgy, steelmaking, aluminum manufacturing, and refining factories were established one after another. Taiwan's economy gradually moved from agriculture to industry.</p>
<p>The recovery of Taiwan is indeed of great help to our country's economy, and it also increases our country's burden. We must cherish the sweat and blood shed by the Taiwanese people in the past, not only to maintain the existing industries, but also to further develop them. Especially in the later stages of the war, Taiwan's major industries suffered a lot of damage and loss, and recovery will not be an easy task. Although many of Taiwan's industries have recovered in the past two years, they have not yet reached their former glory, which still requires our efforts.</p>
<p>To restore Taiwan's industry and further develop Taiwan's production, we must first understand the situation of Taiwan's industry. The book "Taiwan's Industrial Circle" is a good reference. Mr. Jiang Zixin has lived in Taiwan for many years and has a deep understanding of the situation in Taiwan's industrial circle. It can be said that the whole book is a general view of Taiwan's industrial circle.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into twelve chapters, focusing on Taiwan's production enterprises. All aspects of agriculture, forestry, aquatic products, minerals, and industry are described in detail. The sugar industry is established in a separate chapter to show its importance. In addition, the book describes Taiwan's land, climate, population, commerce, transportation, trade, and other items related to industry in detail. The Japanese management of Taiwan in the past, such as the financial system, the monopoly system, and other issues, are also discussed, and the statistical data of Taiwan before the recovery are even more valuable. The history of the Japanese management of Taiwan in the past fifty-one years can serve as a reference for our country's future development.</p>
<p>Taiwan and Hainan Island are the eyes of our country's coast, and their positions are very important. Taiwan has been managed by the Japanese for half a century and has entered the path of industrialization, but most of Hainan Island has not been developed to this day, except for the coastal area. In fact, the area of Hainan Island is larger than that of Taiwan, and the resources it contains are richer than those of Taiwan, and the conditions for development are more favorable. At this time, the call for the development of Hainan Island is becoming more and more loud, and it is gradually revealed that the similar environment and the situation of managing Taiwan can also serve as a reference for the development of Hainan Island. Therefore, the author specially placed the chapter "Taiwan's Development and Hainan Island's Development" at the end of the whole book, so that the remote desert island in the South China Sea will be transformed from wilderness into fertile land and will compete with Taiwan in the near future.</p>
<h3>New Concepts of Matter</h3>
<p>— Zhonghuan</p>
<p>(By C.G. Darwin, translated by [omitted],</p>
<p>Published by Commercial Press, one of the Little Natural Science Library)</p>
<p>Commercial Press has two good little libraries. One is the Little Mathematics Library, and the other is the Little Natural Science Library. These two little libraries are very suitable for young people to refer to and study, and they are two extremely valuable reading materials. We have to give credit to the efforts of Commercial Press.</p>
<p>"New Concepts of Matter" is adapted from a manuscript of a lecture given by Professor C.G. Darwin at the Lowell Institute in Boston. It is new in that its organization is based on a thematic layout, divided into eight chapters of roughly equal length, so it is slightly different from other books.</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to explain the concepts that make up the basic components of matter, so the first chapter of this book includes the definition of atoms, electrons, protons, photons, etc., and the structure of atoms, which is described simply and clearly, much more clearly than the description in ordinary textbooks. After completing the structure of the atom, the following then discusses waves, diffraction, the uncertainty principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, polarization, collisions, etc., to provide a systematic introduction to the concepts that make up the basic components of the physical world.</p>
<p>Because this book was originally lectured to the Lowell Institute, it is a little too difficult for young people with high school level. Therefore, when reading it, you must not treat it like an ordinary science textbook. You should concentrate and grasp the main points in the book.</p>
<p>The book is accompanied by [number] illustrations, which are all drawn in a "simple", "clear" and "understandable" manner, making it a lot easier for us to read at any time. Especially valuable are the pictures, which all give a concrete impression of the experiment.</p>
<p>The whole book is best read after completing the optics of advanced physics, especially the second and third chapters, which discuss the waves and the diffraction of matter in more detail and very concisely.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of translation, the translator Mr. Yang [omitted] is a famous scholar in China, and he translated it extremely well. However, I think there is a shortcoming, which is a shortcoming shared by the Little Natural Science Library and the Little Mathematics Library, that is, this book is written in classical Chinese. Scientific books are already deep and difficult to read, and now they are translated into classical Chinese, which makes them even more profound and obscure. I hope that the wise Commercial Press will improve this, and it is better to use vernacular so that young people will not reduce their interest in this type of book because of classical Chinese, so that young people can use their precious time to study.</p>
<h3>Kaiming English Grammar</h3>
<p>— Zhu Fang</p>
<p>Written by Lin Yutang, published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>English grammar is often considered a boring and tasteless subject in schools. However, this is not the fault of English grammar itself, but really because of the poor organization of general old-fashioned grammar books and the dull rote memorization of rules by teachers.</p>
<p>This Kaiming English Grammar is a most forward-looking grammar book. It reverses the previous organizational method and focuses entirely on the ideas of English speakers (Notions) as the starting point, and discusses expression methods and the inherent thinking methods of the English based on psychology. However, the author does not focus solely on theory, because he wants to take into account practical aspects, so this book is also very suitable for use as a high school textbook.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are many interesting materials here, so even a student who hates grammar, I think he will not hate it after reading this book. If the English level is poor, and the translator also adds some annotations on the Chinese side that are not in the original book. This Chinese translation is also published by Kaiming.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into sixteen chapters: "The Science of Expression", "Changes in the Tone and Function of Tunes", "The Mood of Sentences", "People and Things and Their Properties", "Number and Quantity", "Weight, Value, Volume, Distance, Shape, Position", "Representation", "Designation", "Modification", "Comparison and Grade", "Various Aspects of Action", "Subject and Object (External Action)", "Action Time", "Fact and Imagination", "Relationship", "The Economy of Expression". Finally, there is also a summary of formal grammar and an index.</p>
<h3>Reading Shi Tuo's "Marriage"</h3>
<p>— Shen Lu</p>
<p>In the few years Shanghai was occupied – undoubtedly, this society, originally radiant and then fiercely heated, was bound to undergo profound and intense changes. The so-called confluence of clouds and opportunities encompassed the ups and downs of many figures, both major and minor, and tragedies and comedies were constantly being staged. However, regrettably, after the end of the war, very few literary works reflecting the social landscape and life of that period have appeared. Shi Tuo's novella "Marriage," which we are discussing here, can be considered one of those few.</p>
<p>"Marriage" is divided into two volumes, the first consisting of six letters written in epistolary form, while the second is divided into six chapters written in a purely fictional style. Throughout the book, the male protagonist, Hu Qu'e, whom the author strives to portray in detail, is an intellectual (a teacher) adrift in the sea of humanity. He possesses a kind nature but also exhibits the wavering and compromising tendencies characteristic of intellectuals in general. At the outset, the author depicts him as seeking to raise funds to marry his fiancée, a female intellectual named Pei Fang (actually also to make a living). In this turbulent and fluctuating society, he concludes that the only path is to engage in business. The six letters in the first volume are all written by the male protagonist, Hu Qu'e, to his fiancée, Pei Fang (brief excerpt: "My only loved one, Pei Fang, you finally left, leaving me behind, returning to our old home in the countryside! Shanghai is still a sea of people, squalid, chaotic, noisy, full of rumors, assassinations, and plunder; yet, in a gust of wind, you are gone, and my heart is swept clean. In Shanghai, with its millions of people, he is alone, like a ship with a severed cable, floating and sinking, tossed about. He is cold, hungry, sick, and dying, but who cares about him? Who thinks of him?"… "Money has tormented me and you, and while you hate it, you still have to love it. After you left, I kept thinking that if there had been no war, and I had saved a bit more money, we should have been married by now, according to our plan. That's why I said in my last letter that I wanted to do business. I could have kept it from you, but because I love you so much, I discussed it with you. I never expected you to object. You say we are all still young, and we can wait until the war is over. You say doing business is uncertain and not very noble. You also say that true happiness is not built on money… But, my little dreamer, please allow me to ask, if the war lasts a hundred years, must we wait a hundred years?"). From this, we naturally grasp the confession of a suffering soul struggling in the quagmire of reality.</p>
<p>The following contains even more poignant accusations: "…I think of your father, an old teacher of thirty years, who should have been enjoying his retirement at home, but he still has to struggle bitterly with poverty. It's not that he doesn't love us, but for the sake of integrity, for refusing to obey the Japanese and their collaborators, he would rather abandon his lifelong career, harden his heart, make you drop out of college, and let your younger brother lose his schooling, and go back to his hometown to open a general store. This is a satire of the nation, Pei Fang, and also tears, a pain that cannot be expressed with tears! Now you should believe that my desire to earn money is not only for ourselves, for you and me to have a simple and happy family in the future, but also for your father, mother, and brother. We cannot only wish for ourselves."</p>
<p>As the letters narrate the unfolding events, Hu Qu'e finally joins the circle of ignorant and incompetent offspring of old-fashioned bureaucratic families, typical young ruffians of Shanghai, speculative merchants, those who value vanity, but are actually fragile Shanghai misses, and pathetic creatures with glorious pasts, yet cold, arrogant, and conceited, and begins to engage in business.</p>
<p>The second volume, written in fictional style, uses the entanglements of these figures as a thread to fully depict the social scene in Shanghai during the occupation! In the end, our male protagonist, Hu Qu'e, having exhausted his beautiful dreams and suffered countless deceptions, has no choice but to resort to murder to vent his despair. Shanghai at that time was such a place (in fact, it is still like this now!): "Whether one is killed or kills, as long as it is not oneself who dies, people must continue to make a living, and it has nothing to do with anyone else. It is like throwing a stone into the sea; the stone is gone, but the sea remains unaffected." (See the ending of "Marriage.")</p>
<p>From "Marriage," we see the archetype of the intellectual in Hu Qu'e, how he struggles with life, and how he wavers and compromises! The process is described with clarity, and the author also implicitly conveys the social environment and the character's own weaknesses in this person's decline and disillusionment—it is truly a mirror for intellectuals, making one wary!</p>
<p>We know that Shi Tuo is also known as Lu Fen. Before the war, his short stories and essays were mostly elegant and readable. The author was adept at depicting rural life and small characters, with a simple and sincere style and deep emotion, which cannot be compared with the crude literary works that only consider political purposes and disregard artistic value. Now, having read "Marriage," I feel that the small figures in the metropolis that appear in his writing are equally vivid and prominent. The humorous and delicate touches between the lines are the author's successes, but also his flaws: because of this, works like "Marriage," strictly speaking, due to the disparity between the front and back forms, when we analyze its structure and focus on narrative techniques, we find some places that are loose and difficult to echo, and the weight of the writing also gives people a sense of "excess" and "deficiency." Overall, "Marriage" is still a work that expresses a fragment of the era and realistic characters. Reading it today still makes people feel familiar. Why is that? I think everyone who has read this book should feel that today's Shanghai society is not similar to what is depicted in the book?</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Wang Yitang and Jin Biwei</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The trials of traitors in Peiping, the most noteworthy and talked about were one man and one woman: the man was Wang Yitang, whose impression given to the audience was "lazy and useless," like "Di Hulu" in the play "Five Martyrs"; the woman was Jin Biwei, whose impression was "fiery and unruly," like Grandma Ba Jiu in "Suan Yan Ridge."</p>
<p>Wang Yitang's courtesy name was Zhiyang, later changed to Geng, and he also used his courtesy name as his given name Yitang. He was also known as Yutang, Shi Gong, and the owner of Jin Chuan Shi Lou. People called him "Wang the Bearded." This old fellow has a long history and many strange stories. He is seventy years old this year, which can be considered a "rare grand celebration." Since his arrest, he has undergone many trials. His special secret is to pretend to be mute and deaf, feigning illness and acting foolish, "not answering ten questions out of ten." Asked about his birthplace? No answer. Asked about his name? No answer. Asked about his residence? No answer. Asked what he had done before? No answer. Asked what he meant by joining the puppet government? No answer. Asked about his acts of treason and flattering the enemy during his tenure as puppet chief? No answer at all. One trial after another, never answering. Such composure is worthy of ten years of meditation against a wall, with profound concentration ("Songzi" claims to be proficient in playing the zither). Occasionally, he mumbles a few words in a delirium, saying "can't hear" and "don't understand," which further enhances the effect.</p>
<p>At first, people thought that this old man was of such an old age, living behind bars, with a disordered mind and distressed spirit, or that it was the real situation. Unexpectedly, after his first sentencing, he unexpectedly "bit back" at Judge He in court! He complained to the higher authorities, claiming that He had served as the director of academic affairs in the judicial training institute under his administration as the chief, and was also a traitor. It was unreasonable and unwilling to have a small traitor judge a big traitor. Sure enough, the censor impeached He, removed him from his post, and investigated him. Wang the Bearded's move was highly effective. He seemed to have learned from Song Shijie in the play "Four Scholars," who, after being sentenced incorrectly by Judge Mao Peng in the last scene, had Yang Suzhen recognize that Mao Peng was the one who wrote the complaint in Songlin, so he went to court a second time and questioned Mao Peng, saying, "You are the chief culprit!" Sure enough, Mao Peng was caught by him, and had to step down and apologize carefully, even complimenting old Song as "an old gentleman who can't be said to be bad." So old Song was acquitted! However, that was just a play, not in accordance with the truth. Even if Judge He was a small traitor, Wang the Bearded could not be exempt from the crime of being a big traitor. But Judge He was eventually overthrown by Wang the Bearded, which is in line with what Lu Su said to Kong Ming in the play "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats": "I have to pull someone down with me when I die!" From this point of view, this old fox's illness and deafness are all pretenses, a true and utter "old cunning and treacherous" fellow!</p>
<p>Being carried from the hospital on a sickbed to the prison, and from the prison to the court for trial, over and over again, carrying him back and forth, the audience felt as if they were watching a play. An old man who came from the examination system, where is his dignity! Although Wang Kemin was a traitorous ringleader, his death was clean and neat, surpassing Wang Yitang.</p>
<p>Jin Biwei, also known as Bihui, also called Kawashima Yoshiko, was known as "Commander Jin." In the past, her biological father (former Prince Su of the Qing Dynasty) and her Japanese father Kawashima Naniwa did many thrilling and bizarre things. After the restoration, she was arrested, and during the grand trial, she performed strange tunes and phrases that no other male or female traitor had ever done in court. With a loud shout, she was like King Xiang Yu of Chu, scattering a thousand men! When the judge asked questions, she always turned to the offensive. If she was asked one question, she would ask two back; if she was asked two questions, she would ask three back. When asked if she liked riding horses, sword dancing, playing ball, and other acrobatics, she asked in return if these were also illegal? You don't ask proper questions, but idle chatter! For a prisoner to teach those in court, it was truly unheard of, and bowing to the portrait of President Sun Yat-sen hanging in the court and calling him "Uncle Sun" was even more absurd. Four years ago, when Wang Jingwei inspected the old capital as the puppet chairman, she used her Japanese connections to discuss the friendship between their fathers with Wang (when Wang assassinated the Qing Prince Regent, Prince Su had tried to prevent him from being sentenced to death and imprisonment), calling Wang "Uncle." It can be seen that she has a habit of calling people "Uncle" casually.</p>
<p>When she was a commander, she was very rude to the Japanese military police. Gao Jiyi (director of the Beining Railway Bureau during Zhang Xueliang's time) was arrested by the Japanese, and she rescued him, even beating and scolding the Japanese soldiers. This matter was quite satisfying and should not be dismissed because of her other actions.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Strengths in Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Competition is a good phenomenon. Only when everyone has a competitive spirit can society progress, and this is especially true for calligraphy. However, people have different talents, so their achievements also vary. If one is determined to become famous in future generations, one must change direction and strive to engage in other areas, and the result can also achieve different qualities with the same beauty. Otherwise, your name will only always be below others, obscured and not prominent. Therefore, if competition is not possible, retreating and avoiding strengths is also a wise move. History says that Zhang Changshi and Yan Lugong initially studied regular script together. Zhang knew that he was inferior to Yan, so he turned to cursive script, and his name became greatly famous. Also, in the Records of Zhonghao, it is said that Yang Huizhi initially studied painting as well. Seeing that Wu Daozi was superior, he turned to sculpture, and his name also dominated the world. As for Gu Xuepo and Xu Tieshan of Changshu in the early Qing Dynasty, they originally painted landscapes together with Wang Shigu when they were young. Later, Wang Shigu traveled with Wang Yanke and Wang Yuanzhao of Taicang, and saw genuine works of the Song and Yuan dynasties, and his knowledge progressed day by day. Xuepo and Tieshan knew that they could not surpass him, so one went to paint bamboo, and the other went to paint horses, and both achieved great accomplishments (as seen in the Liunan Notes). It can be seen that jealousy is the most undesirable thing, and avoiding strengths is not a bad thing.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>General Smuts, the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, not long after taking office, was preparing to deliver an important policy speech to Parliament. He called his secretary and instructed him to carefully check the files, because several places in the speech required precise statistical data for explanation.</p>
<p>Seven hours later, his secretary came to report: "General, the statistical material you need would take at least five years to sort out, and no one can find it at present."</p>
<p>The next day, Smuts attended Parliament on time and delivered a very moving speech, with detailed statistical figures supplementing each key point. The MPs were greatly moved, and Smuts' secretary was even more admired. When Smuts returned to the office, the secretary asked him: "Your statistical material today was so rich and accurate, may I ask who found it for you?"</p>
<p>General Smuts said: "Didn't you say yesterday that no one could find these statistics within five years? So, I just made up my own statistics. Anyway, who would spend five years to check whether my statistics are correct!"</p>
<h3>Children's Biography Literature</h3>
<p>— Wen Jie</p>
<p>Biography literature in our country has not yet been developed. Even if there is, it is limited to a few so-called biographies of famous people or autobiographies of great people. I once heard an editor say: To write about someone, that person must be limited to famous or great people. This may have "business" reasons. As far as the "literary" standpoint is concerned, there is no need for biographies to be limited to famous or great people. For example, Zhang Dian's "Biography of Unusual People." This book has quite literary value, but the content is not entirely about famous and great people, and what is written is quite worthy of being passed on.</p>
<p>Moreover, as I see it, when famous and great people write their biographies or autobiographies, they must have an "immortal" idea in their hearts. In the writing process, they inevitably cover up a bit, or even fabricate facts, or fabricate facts, and it is not easy to achieve the point of frank narration. If they truly record how they engage in corruption and how they accept bribes, and pass on their scandals and secrets, although it is still a true biography, the "famous" and "great" people will lose their "fame" and "greatness." Accordingly, rather than valuing the biographies of the so-called "giants," we should shift our attention and pay attention to the actions of the "little ones." By "little ones," I mean children.</p>
<p>In our daily lives, what we are concerned about all day long are military and national affairs, as well as the oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar that are closely related to military and national affairs. But when we meet with friends, what we talk about is nothing more than the above two major items. And who doesn't have children, but except for the necessary formalities, there is little exchange of information about each other's children. This shows that we lack attention to children. Although it is said that life is difficult, so we have no time for this, why don't the general writers and writers, in addition to paying attention to important people and things, divert their energy to our children?</p>
<p>Even with novels, most Chinese and foreign works, ancient and modern, are aimed at adults, and even if children appear, they are mostly supporting roles. Novels that are purely aimed at children are probably not very common even in Europe and America. Novels that purely depict children, such as Amicis' "Education of Love" and Alcott Louisa's "Little Women" and "Little Men," are also rare works in the West. In China, as far as I know, there is probably only one work that belongs to this category: Lao She's "Xiao Po's Birthday." And the first half of Lao She's work is written very well, while the second half is not written very well.</p>
<p>Since we all have our own children, if the editor of this journal does not object, why not host a "My Child" essay contest? George Crabbe has a saying: "Anyone who has feelings always feels interested in the chattering of children, and parents feel supremely happy when they hear it." "Supreme happiness" is indeed not limited to children's words, but also includes actions. We might as well exchange our "supreme happiness" with each other.</p>

<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 3 On Stage and Off Stage</p>
<p>Seeing that he was just staring blankly, listening intently, he elbowed him and said, "The play is almost over, aren't you leaving?" Zhuzhai then came back to his senses and saw that the guests in the theater were already sitting up one after another. His heart still greedily yearned for the play on the stage, but it was inconvenient not to leave. He had already stood up, but still wanted to watch for a while. Unable to resist Yunqing's constant tugging at his sleeve, urging him to leave quickly, fearing that it would be crowded, he had to support Yunqing and escorted her to the door like a bodyguard before finding a car to send her back. When they arrived at Yunqing's door, Zhuzhai was unwilling to go in because it was too late, and he was about to go back when Yunqing called him to stop: "I have one sentence that I forgot to ask you. Who gave you the tickets for the play today?" Zhuzhai's heart skipped a beat, and he blurted out, "My colleagues at the bank gave them to me." Yunqing said, "Wasn't it Qihuan?" Saying that, she smiled, and without waiting for Zhuzhai to answer, she went straight in. Zhuzhai was very sad when he heard this, and he sat in the car and went back with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>The next morning, it was only a little after ten o'clock when Qihuan called Zhuzhai soon after he arrived at the bank and asked him to go there. Zhuzhai told her that he had to wait until after work to go. Qihuan complained on the phone: "It's not okay to take a little time off to come here and say a few words to me! I have something important to tell you." Zhuzhai's heart had already been pounding when he heard Qihuan's call, and when he heard that she had something important to tell him, how could he not go? He immediately agreed, put the headset down, entrusted his colleagues to take care of things, and rushed to Qihuan's house. When he asked Little Wang's mother, she said that Qihuan hadn't gotten up yet, and Zhuzhai was very hesitant. Just as he was in trouble, Qihuan heard the sound of the two of them talking in the bedroom and asked, "Is that Mr. Xu? Please come in." Zhuzhai walked in and saw Qihuan lying in bed with her beautiful hair loose on the pillow. A quilt only covered her chest, revealing her bright red soft satin pajamas, and her two curved arms were exposed. She smiled slightly at Zhuzhai and said "I'm sorry," pointing to a chair in front of the bed and asking him to sit down. Zhuzhai saw that Qihuan's face still had the remains of last night's rouge and powder, and her skin was as white as snow. After sleeping, her face had a kind of radiant beauty, and he couldn't help but be stunned. Then he heard Qihuan say, "I'm an impatient person, and I can't hide anything in my heart. I want to ask you, was the woman sitting with you watching the play yesterday your wife?" Zhuzhai didn't expect Qihuan to ask him this question. He thought that she had asked him to come this morning just to discuss how the play was performed yesterday. Qihuan's question caught him by surprise, and he quickly replied, "No, no." Qihuan said, "Then, who is she to you?" Zhuzhai said, "She's my cousin." Qihuan said, "Ah, your cousin! Why didn't your wife go?" Zhuzhai said, "She doesn't understand opera." Qihuan said, "If she doesn't understand opera, then your cousin must be an expert." Zhuzhai said, "She graduated from Yuren University and specializes in studying lyrics and music. She is also very interested in Peking Opera." Qihuan said, "Ordinary people understand Peking Opera, and it doesn't necessarily require a specialist in lyrics and music. I gave you two tickets yesterday, originally planning for you to go with your wife. Tonight's play is Yutang Chun. I hope you and your wife can go together." Zhuzhai felt very embarrassed when he heard this. He thought to himself, how could he bring his wife, who doesn't look good, to the stage! Seeing Zhuzhai hesitating and not speaking, Qihuan said again, "Today, your wife must do me the honor of coming. If she doesn't go, it means she looks down on me."</p>
<h3>The American Way of Thinking</h3>
<p>— Dao Xian</p>
<p>Thomas H. Wolf, a reporter for the American magazine Collier's, recently completed a trip across the American continent by bus, from New York to Seattle. The purpose of his trip was solely to meet many ordinary Americans – those who travel by bus – to inquire about the issues they think about on a daily basis, what they talk about, and what troubles and worries they have.</p>
<p>During the nine-day trip, over a distance of three thousand miles, Wolf encountered Americans of various occupations, religious beliefs, and ages. Most of them were starting their vacations or returning after their vacations were over, and many others were visiting relatives and friends. These people came from half of America.</p>
<p>Wolf waited until he had talked to all thirty or forty passengers on each bus before getting off and waiting for the next bus to come. He continued his interviews in this way. He only asked one question: "Where you are, what are the things that people are talking about and thinking about lately?" If the answer didn't provide much material, he would ask some more specific questions, such as prices, the housing shortage, domestic politics, the world situation, foreign loans, isolationism, and the United Nations, etc.</p>
<p>By summarizing and categorizing the many answers, Wolf obtained the current American view of themselves and the world.</p>
<p>The things that Americans care about the most are personal, purely local issues. People in all places are most concerned about high prices, high rents, and the lack of housing. At the same time, because prices are high, many mothers are also going out to work, and children lack maternal education. Moreover, due to the housing shortage, families are crowded together, and children are running into the streets to loaf, creating serious juvenile delinquency problems, which many people are worried about.</p>
<p>Most Americans do not worry that there will be an economic depression in America, but many people feel confused and dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Regarding other things in the United States, whether it is politics, taxes, or labor issues, people in general don't seem to pay much attention to or care about them.</p>
<p>In addition to the problems of prices and housing, what Americans care about most is the world situation, mainly the Soviet Union problem. Americans everywhere are paying attention to international issues, and what people talk about the most is the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Americans are constantly seeking international knowledge. They listen to the radio, and read newspapers and magazines more than before.</p>
<p>People in the eastern United States talk about war more; after arriving on the western plains, this topic is reduced. Although many Americans say that World War III is inevitable – and they estimate the time when the war will break out from six months to twenty-five years – most people do not truly feel that the war is coming soon. And almost everyone does not worry about the war in the future.</p>
<p>Wolf did not encounter anyone talking about or considering isolationism, but this does not mean that all non-isolationists agree with lending to Europe. Most Americans agree with lending to Europe, but mostly for humanitarian reasons, and on the basis of first relieving the situation in America.</p>
<p>This is the conclusion of Wolf's interviews. From this, we can know that the people of the United States and China are both worried about the two major problems of prices and the housing shortage. But we can also see that today, there is a very large distance between the interest that Chinese people have in the United States, and the concern that American people have for China. In Wolf's three thousand-mile interview, not a single American mentioned China!</p>
<p>Like Chongqing Storytelling</p>
<h3>Test Driving and Examining "Tickets"</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuwen, Long Sheng Hua</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that Chongqing, no longer a major political and economic center, has two "mores": one is people wearing Western suits, although most look like what "Russian Three" wears, the wearers are more numerous than in Shanghai. The other is cars, although cars cannot drive down the steepest slopes in Chongqing, there are still so many cars that they seem to intentionally incline on the slopes to show off.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "Since I have followed after the great officers, I cannot walk on foot." It seems that cars were specially prepared for officials; Chongqing is not entirely like that. As far as I know, often sitting in the cars are a regimental commander from the Liu Xiang era, the owner of an old goods store (auction house), an unemployed dancer, a gold bill broker, etc. It seems necessary to go through the "narrative" of these people.</p>
<p>When cars gradually increased in number, it was in the 27th year of the Republic (1938). At that time, passionate news reporters were indignant. They would go to the front of theaters to copy down license plate numbers, and the next day publish a long article in the newspaper, also issuing a list of car owners, marked with a title saying: "A drop of gasoline is a drop of blood, squandered amidst pleasant songs and beautiful dances!"</p>
<p>Today, Chongqing has many more Jeeps, painted in various colors. The foreigners have all left, replaced by Chinese people, but in order to be stylish, it is necessary to carry one or several young women, "having women in the same car." It is necessary to drink enough betel nut to strike a pose, driving as if chasing a train or fleeing a moving car, otherwise it won't be like Gary Cooper. More than once, not only have they hit several rickshaws, but they have also overturned pavilions, and sped away. Because of this, the police can only stare blankly. If you add a barrier, they will simply run you over like a tank. The newspaper has already grown accustomed to seeing this.</p>
<p>These cars generally not only lack driving licenses, but also lack license plates. Sometimes a price tag is pasted on the glass, with the words "Test Drive" written on it. The meaning is: The car is still being tested, and we are not responsible for killing people. Who told you to come and provide me with a "test"?</p>
<p>When I encounter this kind of car, I don't act like a hero at all, I quickly dodge to the sidewalk, and I don't curse it as a "city tiger" or anything like that. It is said that people who encounter tigers just need to climb a tree, but who has seen a tiger knock down a big tree or a power pole? After eating people, tigers would never plausibly shirk responsibility onto the victim for crossing the center of the road, proving that they deserved to die: "accidental falls"—under the wheels.</p>
<p>Even if you avoid it by going to the sidewalk, if it is a rainy day, the mud on Chongqing's special asphalt road, after being impacted at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour, will spray up like a dragon spitting mist, in fan-shaped flowing arrows.</p>
<p>If the wronged souls who die and are injured every year in Chongqing under these circumstances are counted, it will definitely not be fewer than the heads of a demobilized brigade. This can be asserted. Addendum: Some of the drivers who caused the disaster do not run away, but stop the car, do not get out, turn around and hand the police an invoice, as if saying: "Please examine the soul-reaping ticket of the deceased!" Then they reverse the car, and open up the crowd of onlookers, taking advantage of the situation to speed away. People can only blink at its receding car.</p>

<h3>Bullying the Elderly and Seizing a Will, Nephew Attempts to Seize Property</h3>
<p>Wang Hanming asks: I have a legal question, please answer it in the newspaper. My relative, Mr. So-and-so, has one son and three daughters. My relative and one son and two daughters have all passed away. Only his wife and one married daughter remain. His wife, because of her old age, prepared a will in advance, stipulating that all houses, fields, and other fields would be inherited by her daughter, and that she would be responsible for funeral matters. Unexpectedly, this will was taken.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] Your wife's will, which was held by her nephew, can be invalidated by making a new will later. Publishing it in the newspaper and obtaining proof should be properly handled.</p>
