<h3>美援華計劃已批准　救濟法案將提國會　王世杰返京與張羣長談</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京廿九日電〕外長王世杰廿八日應蔣主席召赴牯，陳述其離國期間出席聯大情形及與白宮人士會商經過整其在東京四日見聞後，於廿九日下午五時一刻專機飛返首都，當晚九時許即謁張院長於其官邸，長談至深夜始辭返。衆信，美援　問題爲王氏與蔣主席及張院長之談話重心。據權威人士語記者，王外長在美與杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務及洛維特國務副卿等長談之結果，已使白宮方面對中國現狀有深切之理解與關懷。十月十四日馬卿於紐約訪晤王外長作長談時，或已對援華事成立諒解，美國務院就魏德邁報告盡不予發表一節所發之聲明中，已表明其正準備在遠東採取行動，近時盛傳關於美政府已於十月廿一日批准魏氏報告　及其所提建議之訊，極爲可能。美國援華在原則上已絕無何問題，待決者厥唯眞體行動之方式與時期而已。就前者言，中國現政府之注意力，並未集於貸款一事，因經驗證明，貸款方式所能予中國之支援，實爲短暫而乏力，且中國目前之迫切需要，並非國際支付貸款所可提供之部分及一時之經濟穩定，並不足消弭共匪之叛亂。中美兩國當局必已同意軍火及物資爲加强戡亂，安定社會之無二法寳。該人士稱：蒲立德之主張，在此一方面爲頗切實際者，美軍顧問團在現狀下，極感工作無法開展，擴大組織亦爲必要之事。至於美國援華行動之時期，該人士認爲，在十一月十七日以前，可望有若干爲杜　門總統權限所許之措施，大量援助，則須俟馬歇爾援歐計劃有所決定後，方可見諸實施。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京廿九日電〕外交部權成方面今日透露：杜魯門總統已於十月廿一日批准援助中國之計劃，內容與蒲立德在生活雜誌所發表遊華感所建議者類似，包括軍事及經濟援助。按蒲立德建議於三年內以十三億五千萬元援華，由美國監督管理。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕衆院外委會委員，民主黨衆議員白魯姆氏稱：渠信提交下月國會特別會議之救濟法案，將包括中國在內。中國是否念需救濟與他國相同，則將同時在國會中辯論。又據國務院方面人士稱：起草中之救濟法案內，並未包括中國。該消息又謂，單獨救濟中國之法案，或可於今冬國會例會時提出，但與救濟歐洲一事，常分別予以老慮。</p>
<p>〔中央社　盛頓廿九日電〕嶺南大學校務長亨利博士警吿美國人民稱：如美國人民在此緊急關頭不援助中國，則當中國於不久之將來成爲遠東最强之國家時，美國將失去一偉大友人。亨利係來美爲在　之基督敎聯合大學籌募合十萬美元之基金，渠昨於樂觀俱樂部演說稱：中國人乃偉大之民族，對美有傳統統之誼，渠强調戰時中國人民之勇敢精神，引據數事，以說明中國農民如何有助於在華美軍。渠吿記者稱：在其返嶺南大學之前，將在美作數月之勾留。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京八日電〕外次葉公超稱：按照本月廿七日簽訂之中美救濟協定，美國給予中國人民之救濟物資，約可値三千萬元，　於美國實施中國救濟之詳細情形，一俟完成及核准後，即可公布。</p>
<h3>美衆院外委會委員　周以德由平抵京　今午訪張院長明日飛滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕美衆院外委會委員周以德（見圖），廿九日下午一時許自平專機飛抵此問，司徒大使，魯克斯將軍，茂萊海軍少將及我外部禮賓司長凌其餘等均曾到大校塲基地迎迓。周氏下機後，即由司使陪同赴上海路官邸休息，旅與司使及大使館職員長談，晚八時與司使等共餐。周氏在京擬停留二日，卅一日飛滬，至下月三百再度晋京，謁見將主席。渠定卅日午十一時拜會張羣院長，彼等爲在蓉稔友，周氏甫抵此間，即吿歡迎者，極樂與張氏把晤，下午七時將與王外長會談，並出席宴會。據悉：周氏爲了解我國現况，將儘可能與我朝野人士作友誼之往還，國府副主席孫科及粵省主席宋子文均將爲其非正式訪談對象。周氏曾在華多年，爲我國民衆好友，渠將來根據此次所獲資料撰寫之報吿，必可對中美問之解與友好有莫大裨益。</p>
<h3>華府各校兒童將爲我募食物</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿九日電〕此間學校兒童，將於卅一紀念哈羅文節（按即美國之鬼節，哈羅文乃一乞丐之名）時，赴各家爲在華及其他國家之救濟機構勸募食物，而不似昔日之索取糖果。據往日習慣，每逢此日，學校兒童常至各家索取糖果，如不給予，則門窗常遭擊破，或門牆被塗汚，此間一學校，現正爲南京金陵女子文理學院勸募食物。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿八日電〕此問宣布，美國援華聯合會之司庫柏萊恩，將領導該會之紐約委會，從事一九四七年最後一次之籌募經費運動，以貫澈該會關於敎育衛生暨慈幼之計劃「協助中國使可自動」等籌募運動，將自十一月五日開始，以迄十一月底。據柏萊恩表示，渠深信此項運動將達成其五十萬美元之目標。</p>

<h3>高伯蘭公使闡明　澳對日政策原則　保證太平洋安全不受日侵略　逐步改革日本建立民主制度</h3>
<p>〔訊報訊〕澳洲駐華公使高伯蘭敎授昨日自京抵滬，午後四時假華　飯店舉行記者招待會，說明澳洲之　日政策，　於兩大原則，一爲保證太平洋區域之安全，不復遭受日本之侵略。因而必須解除日本武裝，使其脫離軍國主義，摧毀其發動戰爭之能力。日本現已失去在短期內，發動戰爭之能力，然將來仍須有適當之監　；澳洲竭力主張成立一監督機構，凡對日作戰之十一國均能參加。二爲通過政治社會與經濟制度之逐步改革，建立日本之民主制度。僅憑制定憲法與實行選舉，並不能使日本之社會機構發生根木之變化、但欲使日本成爲眞正之民主國家，必須有此種澈底之變化，因此設立國際監督，實爲必要。對於各記者提出之問題，高公使分別答覆如下：（下接二版一攔）</p>
<h3>五萬元大鈔陝絕未出現</h3>
<p>〔本報西安廿九日電〕樓桐孫前透露以五萬元大鈔，一百億之一部，首先在邊遠省份收購棉花一說，記者頃自西安與此有關之官方及金融界六個單位探悉，今年陝棉之運銷貸款，經由合作金庫者定額爲一百億，惟此款迄未匯達，故將來以何種鈔票支付，尙難預卜。某方又以堅決之語氣稱，此間各單位之金庫，確尙無此種新鈔運到。另某方認爲先在陜省發行新大額鈔，無多大意義，蓋此間與京滬金融活動息息相關，而金融中心地帶之渴求大鈔，甚於陜地。又前中紡撥定專款，在此收購新棉，因　海路運輸困難，此宗巨款亦迄未動用。</p>
<h3>對日和會　英贊成早日召開</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿八日合衆電〕英外部發言人稱：英國贊成早日召開對日和會，並謂：「如蘇聯拒絕參加提早召開之和會，英國政府將持何種觀點，本人尙不知悉」。</p>
<h3>朝鮮應早獲獨立　顧維鈞雜聯大政會演說　籲請美蘇努力速謀解決</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿八日電〕中國代表顧維　博士，在聯大政治委員會中就朝鮮問題發言，　請美國與蘇聯再作一次努力，以自行解決朝鮮問題，顧氏認爲：爲示公允起見，朝鮮問題之解決，不應待諸日本和約最後解決之後。顧氏聲明中國在原則上同志美國之建議，並謂朝鮮人民應儘可能迅速獲得獨立，在軍隊撤出朝鮮以前，必須有下列之不可缺乏之條件：　建立臨時朝鮮民主政府，　組織維護法律與秩序之方法，佔領國必須保證於撤兵之後，不使朝鮮陷入眞空而具有內戰的危險。顧氏並表示，中國政府準備同意聯合國機構所規定之任何條件，但必須先向關係四强即中·英·美·蘇徵求意見。按美代表杜爾斯建議爲：　早日選舉朝鮮國民議會，　由該議會組織朝鮮國民政府，　由國民政府以有秩序的方式，接收韓南·韓北政府之職權，　撤退全部佔領軍，　以上各種步驟均在聯合國機構監督下施行。杜爾斯於檢討兩年來美·蘇談判之經經時，特提出兩點：　當美國於本年八月廿六日建議由中。英·美·蘇四强開會，以謀打破僵局時，蘇聯即予拒絕。　常美國宣布將向聯合國機稱提出此事時，蘇聯突又宣布準備於明年一月問撤兵。杜氏指出，鮮聯之　兵建議，並非適常的解決辦法，蓋目前在朝鮮南北，具有形式完全不同之兩個政府，蘇建　　並未說明在撤軍前如何使兩不同之形式得以絲</p>

<p>〔本報長春廿九日電〕今晨大房身機堪附近發生戰鬥，當被國軍逐走，犯匪退向西北唐家營子一帶地區，國軍往剿中。長市昨夜一度聞槍砲聲，市內白畫極爲安謐，匪之來犯，圖　獎國軍東向吉林，並企圖肌止空運援軍。長春西北區已發現匪一萬人盤據，可能於夜間再偸襲市郊，經判明番號爲匪「西滿獨四師」及第二縱隊殘餘主力。</p>

<h3>社論　運用救濟糧食實施全部配給之建議</h3>
<p>中美救濟協定，規定以若干生活基本必需品協濟我國，其第一項卽爲糧食。其詳細數字，現在雖尙未正式公布，預料嘗不在少數。</p>
<p>我們以此項救濟物資的如何分配間題，聯想到糧食配給問題。試就本市說：從限價。議價，到自由買賣，始終沒有把民食間題完全解決：從自由買賈，平價抛售，到局部配給，亦始終沒有把民食問題完全解決。大家知道；要把本問親完全解決，不得不從全部配給做起，而要辦到全部配給，又不得不把握住充分的物資。但市政府方面，是根本沒有這項物資的，所以談不到配給；過去和現在，市政當局所賴以運用的糧食，祗是由糧食部所撥發的，所以不得不量入爲出來作臨時的抛售，和局部的配給。</p>
<p>依照協定第二條甲，「所有美國救濟物資，……由中國政府及兩國政府所同意之在華業已成立之志願機構分配之」這一條，規定了分配的機關。假如是項糧食，交由市政府或業已成立之民食調配會來分配，這是當然不生問題的。</p>
<p>同條已又載明載「在環境所許可之中國大都市，應創行分配及物價管制制度，以求確保各階層人民，不間其購買力如何，均應獲得自國外輸入或由當地所產救濟之公平份量。雙方瞭解，依照本協定所得之美國救濟物資，得用以支持中國改良費與物價管制之努力。」　無異訂定了，照上海道樣大都市，應該實施全部配給制度；除本國自產和所辦進的洋米洋粉外，並可動用是項救濟物資來作爲支持。</p>
<p>第四條甲項約定：「中國政府將盡一切可能之努力，以求救濟所需之當地所產物資，獲得最大之產量與徵集。這是要我國努力增產，儘量購儲，以便統籌配給。其乙項又訂明：「中國政府担任，不許採用任何措施，使本辦法所述性質之任何物品之交付，出售，或給予，致减少此種物品當地所產之供應，而增加救濟負担。」這又是說：在運用救濟物資，實施統籌配給以後，原來供應的本劉物品，祗可增加，不許減少。</p>
<p>第三條丁：「因救濟之供給，包括駐業美國救濟代表團之工作，及中國政府機關，與志願機構，現正進行中之若干緊急救濟方案，而發生之中國錢幣開支，中國政府豐依美國代表之請求，以美國救濟物資出售之價款作售、預墊基金。」照此看來，連辦理分配救濟物資之機構，不間其爲美方，爲華方，抑爲所謂志願機構，其所需經費，亦許在出售救濟物資之價款項下開支，不過於必要時，由中國政府先行墊付罷了。中國政府對於「救濟物資之處理，內地輸送，及分配而有之當地費用，包括卸貨及其他港口費用之中國錢幣開支在內」，雖於第三條戊項，說明：通常不許拿上項價款來償付，「但美國代表願與中國政府考慮使用此項資金，以應付非常費用，俾免以過分負擔，加諸中國政府」，辦理配給的一切費用，很可能地統由出售價款項下開支了。</p>
<p>辦理全面配給時，我國所應擔負的糧食，究需幾成，協定中並無明文規定。假定各半擔任，以現在全市人口，約四百五十萬人計，其中小口，約居四分之一，按大口二斗，小口一斗計算，每月本市食米，共需七十八萬八千石，則我國所食米配給，便可順利進行，更無何等重大的阻碍。倘使　方同意，卽照現時所撥給的米石照配，其餘悉由救濟糧食中撥充，則俟是項糧食到埠後，所謂全部配給，立時便可實施。本市的民食問題，卽可就此完全解決，更不至至以米價的波動，而時時牽連到一般的物價了。</p>
<p>協定第一條丁項：「中國政府將隨時於事前，向美國政府提出其爲數濟之輸入需要所擬之計劃：此　計劃，應經美國政府之審查及核准」。本市民　　全部配給，旣符合於協定各規定，　適切於雷荆的需要，似可作爲政府計劃之一部，並可作爲　行於其他各大　市之參考。是項救濟物資之　　，於年丙旣可全部辦竣，我們並希望從速擬其計劃，定期　行，以解決此嚴重問題</p>
<p>澳公使答記者問</p>
<p>〔上接一版〕　澳洲反對在對日和會中保持否決權，澳洲對否決權原則之反對，堅持已久，聯合國會議中之記錄，足資證明。澳洲希望對日和會能早日召開，但此與反對否決權無關。又英帝國各份子，在對日和會中，不擬以集團之方式投票。英帝國各份子，除非因共同之危機來臨，否則絕不以集團之姿態出現。　澳洲對於日本未來工業水準之決定，認爲應依據兩個原則，一爲不使日本有再度侵略之機會，二爲應維持日本經濟發展之希望。　對於中國之復興，澳洲歡迎任何有關中國內部復興之消息，因中國之復興，有關遠東之和平及安定。澳洲不願有人利用日本使成安定遠東之勢力，因此舉將重使日本成爲亞洲最强之國家，而使盟國重受威脅。澳洲與中國之貿易量，一九三九年澳貨僅佔中國進口總値百分之六；欲　展中澳貿易，關鍵仍在中國之内部復興，中國必需恢復其出口業後，方有外匯購買他國貨物。　關於未來對日本行使國際監督，高公使主張各國應派眾駐日，並要求日本厲行政治及經濟上之改革。至於實施監督之期間，此時遽加推測，不免流於書生之見，因國際形勢隨時變化，一切應根據實際情勢而取決。又日本之賠償間題，此時尙不知賠償之總額，此爲一長期之工作，應於盟國嚴審監督之下執行，而其分配將使一整個之區域蒙受其利益。値得注意者，即歷史上每次戰爭，其賠償額每較預期者爲少。高公使最後復指出因局勢之演變，澳洲在東南亞及太平洋之責任，已較過去爲重。今日澳洲且已實施配給制度，節衣縮食，捐獻二千五百萬鎊，協助解除英倫之經濟危機。澳洲對於東南亞戰後新興之民族勢力，伊伐特外長已聲明願「以現實反諒解態度相對待」，但渴望其成爲巨大之合作力量，以提高全地區人民之生活程度。</p>
<p>對日開放貿易情形</p>
<p>（上接一版）　此次開放貿易，其起因在應付美商，幷藉此鼓勵原料進口，惟僅准外商來日，幷不准日商出國推銷，故日本實居被動地位，無法在他國市塲活動。　日本因原料資金兩缺，出產能力降低，無大量貨物可以出口，　論傾銷，且在盟總嚴格管制貨價之下，更無法與他國競爭，　輸出貨物，除海產，竹，漆器皿及其消耗品可以現金購取外，所有機器及重要五金材料，均須以進口原料交換。　調察現狀，在一年內，日本輸出難望發展，中日貿易更少樂觀，依據紀錄，去年度我國欠日約一百五十萬美元，本年度尙未結算，恐數額更鉅，致使採購困難，雖迭以我國因抗戰損失甚鉅，物炎缺乏之詞相辯論，但貿易與賠償不同，懸賬未消，勢難過分爭執，如不改　更張，積極增加我國輸出，全部貿易，恐將停止，　再查他國貿易進展情形，美以一億美元借款供給棉花，換購紗布。澳大利亞自停戰後，除已輸入羊毛七千包外，近復派專家多人來日，商討毛絨交換及擴充輸入數量。印代表來此，亦以棉花交換機器爲主要任務。其餘英。加。菲。荷各國，均有相當活動。中日關係密切，更不容忽。　開放貿易，旨在鼓勵商營，我國可機獎勵商人輸出，進口物資除政府直接採購儲者外，似宜由輸出商在管制範圍內優先承辦，蓋聞輸入物資利潤較厚，以輸入所獲鉅利，補償輸出，再加以外匯嚴根管制，則出數額自易增加</p>

<h3>民盟違法活動眞相</h3>
<p>— （續昨）</p>
<p>及國軍收復長春，中共在東北力量崩潰，急欲尋一緩兵之計，於是中共代表團乃派齊燕銘。王炳南，於三十五年五月二十八日赴滬，偕民盟章伯鈞。黃炎培。梁漱滇。沈鈞儒等到京與中共周恩來。蓋必武。陸定一。齊燕銘等四人商議。其時中共之陰謀，一方面耍求政府停止東北軍事行動，而另一方面堅特改組東北政委會及各級政府，由各黨派參加策動，民盟出而努力，八月廿九日上午民盟即運照共匪指示，派代表與馬歇爾會談，提出全面停戰與改組東北政務機構之意見。此後民盟復在上海與中共策動馬叙倫，閻寳航等，發動其所謂反內戰運動，以適應中共緩兵之目的。民盟此一活動未吿成功，但其盟員則相率潛入東北，爲共匪之偽組織服務</p>
<p>改組政府問題：擴大政府組織，爲政治協商會議五項協議案之下，原定於召開國民大會以前付諸實施，此協議案第六條規定，國民政府委員會所討論之議案，涉及施政綱領之變更者，須有出席委員三分之二之贊成，始得議決。中共與民盟要求彼等在府委四十名中必須佔有十四名，即超過三分之一。以維持其所謂否決權，此一要求，爲其他黨派所反對，引起爭執，致令政府改組爲之遲延。由此足以蹬明民盟對中共之親密追隨，而中共對民盟亦信任其必能爲其政爭之工具。</p>
<p>國大問題：召開國民大會，爲政協五項協議案之一，原期於民國三十五年五月五日實行，比及會期將屆，而中共民盟拒絕提出參加國府及國大之兩項名單，政府遂不能不宣佈國大延期。同年六月，政府定於十一月十二日召開國大，而民盟仍追隨中共，拒絕提出其參加國大之代表名單，十月廿八日，社會賢達莫德惠等出面調停，由第三方面人士簽名出席國大，以爲國大延期三日之條件，俾政府與中共得於此三日內，達到改組政府及軍事問題之協議，民盟之羅隆基等亦經簽字，不意周恩來對民盟梁漱　諸人嚴加申斥，彼等乃知此種決定有違中共意旨，遂取消簽名，此爲民盟在和平商談中尾隨中共之最後表現，其經過具見於卅六年十月十四日各報所載張君勸氏之說明。</p>
<p>和談問題：卅五年一月之停止衝突恢復交通協定，與二月之整編國軍及統編共軍爲國軍方案，爲和平商談之基礎，而政協關於軍事問題之協議案，民盟代表亦曾參加簽署，然在卅五年一年中，和平商談由於中共堅特軍事割據，並加緊軍事叛亂，拖延不決，最後卒吿失敗。在此一年中，民主同盟在中共提議停戰時，則附和停戰，如五月以後之商談，在中共反對停戰時，則亦反對停戰，如國大前夕之商談，而在宣傳上民盟歷次談話及文件，無一不將和談拖延之責任加於政府，其二中全會之政治報吿，更完全代共匪發言，指責政府負和談失敗之責任。</p>
<p>國大閉幕以後，中共已決心軍事叛亂到底，堅持無理條件，反對重開和談，民盟遂亦遵照其意旨，發動宣傳，反對上海工商界人土王曉籟，吳蘊初等所發起之和平運動，民盟認爲唯有農村中向政府抗丁抗糧，城市中向政府抗捐抗稅，方爲眞和平運動，羅隆基並公開聲明，民盟不參加不以眞和平爲目的之和談，自此以後，民明放棄和平運動，專致力於抗丁，抗糧，抗稅，抗捐，及煽動學潮工潮之地下工作。</p>
<p>反美運動：中共於三十五年七月間，開始反美運動，民盟亦遵循指示，附和一致，至九月，中共上海市委定爲「反美宣傳突擊月」，首由中共周恩來派陳家康，喬木，范長江等，與民盟羅隆基，沈鈞儒，章伯鈞，劉王立明等聯絡，由中共資助民盟，使其策動所謂「十大人民團體」，成立「世界和平促進會」，自九月廿三日起九月廿九日止，舉行「美軍退出中國宣傳週」。</p>
<p>九月廿七日，重慶由民盟鄧初民等，北平由民盟張東蓀，張申府等，新加坡由民盟胡愈之，胡守愚等，同時舉行反美座談會或代表會，其餘香港，昆明等地，亦先後發動，中共在其關內外共匪割據地區，則自十月七日起發動呼應，至十一月中下旬，民盟又配合巾共，在滬渝平各地展開反對中美商約之宣傳，直至今日，此項宜傳仍繼續加强。</p>
<p>國際干涉問題：卅六年三月，莫斯科三國外長會議舉行之前，民盟接受中共指示，發動要求國際共同干涉我國內政之運動，以張中共之聲勢，上海文匯報及其同路之報紙，鼓吹國際干涉，不遺餘力，爲有目所共睹，茲不其陳，民盟負責人張瀾等，更會同民主促進會，民主建國會人員，聯名致電英斯科外長會議，攻擊美國，要求三國共同商討中國問題，而民盟館導之職業學生，亦在京滬若干大學中發動同樣之運動，要求國際十涉中國。</p>
<p>（乙）民盟担任匪區</p>
<p>工作之事實</p>
<p>民主同盟在一方面破壞政治協商會議之協議案，拒絕參加國民大會及國民政府，並對參加國大及國府之民社黨予以開除之處分，在另一方面，則有計劃的參加共匪之非法政權，三十五年八月七日至十五日，共匪東北局在哈爾濱召開「東北各省市代表會議」，成立僞「東北各省市聯合行政辦事處」以後，民盟人員紛紛潛赴東北匪區，擔任重要僞職，茲條列其事實於左：</p>
<p>共匪吸收盟員往匪區：三十五年九月間，周恩來在滬，即與民盟羅隆基。章伯鈞等商定，登記民盟失業人員前往匪區工作，茲錄中共代表團致民盟總部原函於下：</p>
<p>奉周恩來先生交下與貴盟談話記錄一份，在京滬一帶貴盟失業八員達三百餘人，其中多以在文化敎育工商各界服務，能力高强者，由本團先予登記，以便安插工作，茲由本團派定華强同志爲南京負責登記人往南京中山路三百六十號新華日報辦事處，請通知貴盟失業人員，凡　往解放區工作，自卅五年九月廿六日起，持貴盟證明函件，親赴上項地點登紀。（下接第三版）</p>

<h3>力謀解決朝鮮問題僵局　英國支持美建議　蘇仍堅持美蘇應先撤兵　並主邀請朝鮮代表參加聯大討論</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社成功湖廿八日電﹞英國廿八日完全擁護美國成立聯合國委員會監督朝鮮選舉及美蘇駐軍自該國撤退之建議，兼任安理會主席英代表賈德幹吿聯大政治委員會稱：有一中立團體監督朝鮮選舉，係屬極重要之舉。賈德幹反對蘇聯建議，即不需有外援，而即令兩國駐軍撤退與任令朝鮮人民成立其本國之政府。渠稱此事可能引起更大之混亂。渠稱英政府不願對此事負責。賈德幹並反對蘇聯建議，即由朝鮮派遺適當代表來聯合國參加關於其本國事件之討論。渠稱：此事將引起嚴重不可克服之困難，因在本屆聯合國大會中，此等代表不能及時趕到也。渠認爲在目前階段，不能有眞正之朝鮮代表來此，再者渠亦認爲無此必要。美國建議並非欲以某種特別政權，加諸朝鮮人民之身。賈德幹演說後，波蘭代表波繼克繼起發言，表示擁護蘇代表葛羅米柯二十八日所發表之蘇方建議。葛羅米柯再度宣稱美蘇軍隊應先行撤退，並在美國建議付諸表決前，應使朝鮮代表前來成功湖討論。但澳洲代表伊伐特指出蘇聯提案未以書面提出政治委員會主席盧森壁代表貝許同意此點，當即宣吿休會，至廿九日晨十一時再開。在此以前伊伐特力言澳洲及其他若干國家參加太平洋作戰較蘇聯爲久，故在草斯科及其他地點關於朝鮮間題之會商，不應無太平洋有關之國家參加在內。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿九日電﹞美代表團發言人今日聲稱：蘇聯要求聯合國大會邀請朝鲜人民代表參加辯州論朝鮮獨立問題並命令美蘇兩國軍隊在明年一月一日以前退出朝鮮，美國均表反對。蘇聯建議並非必要，且顯係稽延甚或停止聯合國大會討論該案。（顧維鈞談話稿，見第一版）</p>
<h3>朝鮮問題眞相</h3>
<p>﹝路透社成功湖廿九日電〕在朝鮮問題之後，蘊藏與巴爾幹局勢相仿之複雜而困難的政治局勢，美蘇在第一回合中，雖互指於談判朝鮮獨立時缺乏信念，然變方均未述及現存僵局後所存在的政治實况。朝鮮統一之主要障碍，乃臨時政府方式之不能協議。蘇聯堅持過去反對託管之韓人不得參加，事實上即係除共產黨外均不得參加，而美國堅主一切政黨均應參加。</p>
<p>臨時政府之紐織，蘇聯堅持應使韓人不受外界干涉自組政府，係因相信韓北之共產黨較韓南之非共產政黨組織更爲嚴密，實力更爲堅强，故如不在美國監督下舉行選舉，則韓共憑其宣傳得以獨攬各要職。美當局爲應付其佔領區內之政治弱點起見，堅主朝鮮之議會應依比例代表制選舉，使佔全韓人口三分之二之南部區域，得取得三分之二之多數。</p>

<h3>蒲立特抨擊蘇聯　指陳蘇聯企圖征服中國　强調亟應迫令史達林知難而退</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社紐約廿九日電﹞前駐蘇大使蒲立特抨擊蘇聯欲以共產主義統治世界，並加强自身力量，以便「進擊美國」。蒲氏稱：蘇聯目的從未改變，除非蘇聯人民力能控制其政府，則此項目標將永不改變。史達林氏將永不知止境。吾人僅能迫使史達林知難而退。目前蘇聯不敢討論對美國發動戰爭，蘇聯目前正加强國力，以便最後進機美國。目下蘇聯正團鞏固其對一億二千萬歐洲人之控制，且欲攫奪法國，義大利，希臘，及征服中國。</p>

<h3>美國會特會召開在即　馬希爾遄返華府　杜魯門着手草擬立法案</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿九日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾於廿九日返華盛頓，準備援歐之國會特別會議。以後聯大會議如有主要問題討論時，渠或將隨時來此，然聯大中經常工作已交與美首席代表奧斯汀。</p>
<p>﹝路透社華盛頓二十八日電﹞杜魯門總統已於今日開始起草其將向國會特別會議提出之咨文，內容將建議執行馬歇爾歐洲復興計劃之立法案。總統新聞秘書羅斯於宣佈此事時，並曰總統業已接獲哈里曼所領導援外顧問委員會所議決之若千建議。權威方面透露二該計劃之主要內容已暫定爲：　由國會批准撥款七十億元，作爲歐洲四年經濟復興計劃第一年內之援助額，四年總計需要約二百億元，每年所需依次遞减。　由參加馬歇爾計劃各歐洲國家政府成立多邊協定，接受美國所擬計劃之原則，並由美國與每一歐洲國家政府，訂立雙方協定。比係表示歐洲國家亦應如美國之盡其力量，協助馬歇爾計劃之實行。　責成每一參加之歐洲國家，將自美所獲物品出售所得，列入其預算案內。例如美國根據馬歇爾計劃以小麥供給法國，法國不必支付麥價，但將以等於所獲小麥美元價値之法郞數額，列入其預算之收入項內，此項法郞將用以增加法國對於執行馬歇爾計劃所從事之貢獻。此舉可以减少馬歇爾舊計劃所需之美元數額。</p>
<h3>塔虎脫抨擊馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社波士頓廿八日電〕參議員塔虎脫廿八日稱：目下形式之馬歇爾計劃爲「毫無理智」。塔虎脫爲共和黨提名總統候選人，在國會中恐亦係共和黨最有力之領袖。渠抨擊政府之援歐計劃，此事殆已指出渠將在十一月十七日國會特別會中領導此項鬥爭。渠稱美國之所以有通貨膨脹，實因援助外國太多所致。渠批評煤斤及鋼鐵運歐一事稱，歐洲煤藏甚多，而鋼鐵則在美國亦感缺少。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林廿八日電〕德境美軍總司令克萊山將廿八日吿記者招待會稱：渠可能於明年退出軍界，渠已要求陸軍部於一九四八年令其退休，俾渠能擺脫銜有軍務及公共生活，重返喬治亞洲故鄕埀釣以度餘年。據稱：美國計劃在德境展開宣傳攻勢，「保衛吾人所相信之主義，攻擊吾人所不相信之主義一。官方稱：此項新計劃之目的，殆在對付共產情報局。克萊中將之聲明，乃美國在世界各處發動宣傳攻勢之意，蓋蘇聯在世界各處宣傳企岡打到美國之勢力。克萊中將所稱美國之宣傳並不攻擊任何外國政府，乃在解釋美國之政策。軍政府已下令，任何政府官員在公開演說中不得攻擊外國政府，同時美軍重政府中深信共產主義者將予撤職。</p>
<h3>遣送日俘問題美蘇又起爭執</h3>

<h3>日民主黨　合縱連橫　產田活動下屆首相</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿九日電﹞民主黨對於以自由黨爲中心之保守新黨運動，政治研究其對策，而鑒於現內閣之陷於窮境，乃以下屆首相爲目標而集中努力。縱來稱爲幣原派之一松，木村兩相，亦表明竭力支持　田担任下屆總理，並一致暫成統一黨内。但對自由黨，則提議組織四黨聯合內閣，若自由黨反對，則似將對自由黨採取分化工作。目前保守新黨運動與　田任首相之四黨聯立内閣運動，似已交錯活動。國協黨亦有與民主黨合流之趨勢。社會黨方面，西尾方面對之似已有諒解，然如西尾楱近民主黨，則平野頗有採反對行動之可能性。</p>

<h3>阻撓戴高樂派反蘇集會　法共舉行大示威　軍警出動發生激烈衝突</h3>
<p>﹝合衆社巴黎廿八日電〕法國共產黨員一萬五千名廿八日舉行示威遊行，擬衝破戴高樂派之反蘇集會，但終被警察用木棍及槍頭將被等驅散。此事之發生，僅在賴瑪迪總理要求議會對其聯合政府投信任票之後戴數生　　賴瑪迪在議會聲稱：如法國分裂爲左右兩派敵對陣營，則內戰殆不可免。投票將於三十日（星期四）舉行。</p>
<p>參加示威者受傷甚多，憲兵十二人亦被石頭所擊傷，衝突達兩小時之久，大隊正規軍携手提機關槍開到維持秩序，衝突始行停止。戴高樂派集會原定在巴黎東部瓦格藍街之瓦格藍禮堂舉行。警察將共產黨羣衆由瓦格蓋街驅至脫奈斯廣塲，然后由該處之騎兵將彼等驅散。警察驅逐示威者時，沿街婦女羣衆哭聲震天。出事地點所有店鋪之窗戶均已被擊碎，沿街均見示威者遺落之皮鞋，手提包等物。示咸者多人業已被捕。戴高樂派之集會卒能舉行，僅因事變阻遲三十分州耳。</p>
<p>﹝合衆社巴黎廿九日電﹞軍警驅散共產黨示威羣衆之舉，已使巴黎於廿九日遭遇解放以來之最嚴重政治事件。左派「人道報」稱此以外事件爲「流血之抨擊」，抨擊賴瑪迪爲「反蘇暴徒之保　者」。該報又稱：「此即爲出賣法國人民利益之政策所引起之結果，此及順從金元帝國政策所引起之結果。」</p>

<p>周鯨文駱賓基等勾結共匪籌組僞政權經過。</p>
<p>分裂東北領土主權，爲共匪始終一貫之陰謀野心，民主同盟乃爲其政治軍事之助手，三十五年國大開會前，民盟中常委周鯨文，在滬與僞滿　留之代表「東北靑年協曾」負責人陳健中會晤，決定請求共匪在東北劃定地區，集中武力，聯合共匪，民盟，「東靑」等，成立僞「東北自治政府」。陳健中復經周鯨文介紹，與共匪代表董必武晤面，董允介紹陳等與林彪，李立三晤商。據周鯨文告陳，如能糾合部隊，共軍可供給地區，如能在三十六年三月十日以前，提出停戰口號，成立僞府，則可能引起國際重視等語。</p>
<p>三十六年一月，周鯨文即派駱賓基（據民盟向政府提出之名單列載，駱係民盟東北總支部執委）偕陳健中赴東北，視察陳部實力，並聯擊東北華北各地新舊關係。路燈自北寗綫出關經瀋陽到達長春，由民盟周鯨文領導之「東北人民自治委員會籌備會，」陳健中領導之「東北靑年協會」並由陳拉攏「東北人民愛國　援會」等三方面，於三月八日在長春簽訂「協定書」，成立僞「臨時東北人民自治委員會，」及偽「東北人民自治軍總司令部」。僞自治委員會之僞中央委員會，計委員長一人，推由民盟周鯨文担任，委員十七人，計民盟四名，共匪四名，「三民主義同志聯合會，」「東北文化協會，」「東北政治建設協會，」「東北靑年協會，」「東北人民愛國應援會」等五團體共八名，及所謂「社會賢達」一人。</p>

<p>〔本報台北廿七日航訊〕最近琉球問題，巳引起國內外一致的關心，台灣以地理關係，與琉球　齒相依，一般人士尤深關切，故張院長蒞台時，記者曾有以此事相詢者。琉球人過去在台謀生者，數達一萬五千餘人，光復後，即悉數遺返，僅留用六十餘人，大部份爲漁業人員。頃據最近　自琉球返台之僑胞向記者描述該島之現狀稱：直經六十里之琉球島上，經砲火洗禮，已無一幢完整房崖，碩果僅存者，惟首邑那覇尙有一水泥構築之小洋樓而已，餘則全部夷平。居民生活極為困苦，蓋島上不罷種植食糧，所有菜蔬亦仰求外公路甚佳，有水泥高級路面，亦有石子路。島北部美軍構築工事，資，其中亦有供應中國者，至國人在該島僅有二三人，係辦理物資供應事宜，所需食糧及日用品，大部由上海運去。琉球之首邑那霸距基隊港三一三　，（基隆距上海四二六浬），爲每年颱風經由台灣進襲日本必經之地，該島美國軍用氣象總台，與本省氣象局經常交換氣象情報。張院長巡視基隆時，曾有琉球革命同志會會員三千人代表喜友名，向張院長提出請願書，要求琉球歸還我國。據悉：喜某即係琉球漁民，現留用在台，常居基隆。台省走私風熾，聞大部以小船駛至琉球海面互僞交換，張院長在台亦曾詢及此事，當局苦無具體數字提供參考。至走私來台被扣押之日琉人消息，本報已於二十三日刋載，「走私法」已取消，類此案件當局無從處理。</p>

<h3>民盟違法活動眞相</h3>
<p>（上文接第三版）</p>
<p>二。民盟與李濟琛勾結共匪在華南布置軍事暴動情形。</p>
<p>三十六年三月二十一日至二十二日，共匪廣東省委之「廣東武裝工作委員會」會議，決定發展農村武裝暴動，成立偽「廣東人民武裝解放委員會」爲指揮機關，並規定委員會由七人組成，聘請「顧問」五人，包括共匪僞中央一人，共匪地方代表二人，民主同盟一人，社曾人士一名，全省劃分六個月分區指揮所，該次會議紀錄，業經査獲。</p>
<p>三十六年五月共匪華南局指示「當前兩廣區特殊鬥爭新任務」文件，規定利用民主同盟，「三民主義同志聯合會」（李濟琛等之反動組織）、農工民主黨等，結成「政治同盟」與「軍事同盟」，原文件稱：「黨必須為民盟建立基地」，「在香港成立中心部」，「政治同盟以民盟爲中心，軍事同盟以張炎系爲中心」，未來盟主，最好由李濟琛等人來担任」，「召築李濟琛蔡廷鍇爲首的粵桂系首腦，農工黨，三聯，海外派，及各地軍事組織領導人，舉行聯席會議……」等語，是項文件亦經査獲。</p>
<p>三。杜斌丞勾結共匪煽惑國軍叛變事實。</p>
<p>據長春捕獲通匪叛國犯陳健中供：「中華人民自治總會，由李濟琛主持，地點大概在香港，祇聽說南京區，中原區，西南區均有人員責，西北地區是社斌丞或中共人員負責」等語，査杜係民主同盟西北總支部主委，（該總支部執委李數仁，已於三十五年往陝北匪區祖任僞延安大學校長職，關夢覺巳於三十五年十月去東北匪區任僞嫩江省敎育廳長職），勾結共匪，秘密組任共匪關中地委負責人，先後與韓北鶚等煽惑國軍將領孔從周趙壽山投匪，並密謀暴動經陝西全省戒嚴司令部査明確實，依法訊辦　四·民盟李蔭楓勾結共匪密謀川東北武裝暴動事實。</p>
<p>民主同盟盟員李蔭楓，原爲四川失意軍人，加入民盟後，即積極聯絡失意軍人煽惑現職軍官叛變，招收軍火技術人才，勾結共匪李先念部，密謀在四川東北發動武裝暴動，經警憲機關破獲，連同同黨李子伯，蕭銘鼎，何雷松等，一併捕訊，均經供認不諱。</p>
<p>（丁）民盟與共匪合　力煽動工潮學潮之事實</p>
<p>一。煽動工潮</p>
<p>上海勸工大樓事件，爲共匪民盟共同製造之反美運動集會，會塲上發生紛爭，引起鬥毆，三十六年二月二十八日，中共代表團陳家康，在滬召集民盟黃炎培，施復亮及民主促進會馬叙倫，潘振亞等開會，討論擴大勸工大樓事件問題，決議要點如下：　加强梁仁達治喪委員會之組織，由馬叙倫負責。　擴大策動各職工會響應。　加强宣傳「二九慘案」眞相，增發宜傳品。　「愛用國貨抵制美貨會」，由沈鈞儒負責指導組織分曾。　聘請律師向地院拔査處起訴，由史良負責。　發動學生響應，由潘振亞負責。　仍保持「滬市學生抗暴聯」組織，並加强之。</p>
<p>五月六日，民盟京市辦事處韓卓儒等會議，討論總部發下之羣運工作指示，決定：　組織下關碼頭工人及交通機關員工（包括鐵路），　加强中大內部盟務活動，其他各校亦應開展組織。　於市郊區開展農運。　婦運應從速成立婦運小組，組織婦女外圍團體。</p>
<p>十月間，民盟李相符指示京市盟員發展京市水電兩廠工人組織關係，以爲必要時發動罷工，破壞水電，擾亂社會基礎，以上各項事實，警憲機關均獲有確切情報。</p>
<p>二。　煽動學潮：卅六年五月學潮之前夕，中央大學學生自治會改選，京市民盟辦事處以鉅款支特梅振乾競選，先後由郭亨衢，廖祖緣，自李相符處支領活動費九百萬元，（一次六百萬元，一次三百萬元。）</p>
<p>共匪民盟計劃以五四紀念爲五月學潮之開始，上海共匪「五月工作計劃」第二項規定爲「發動學潮，以五四紀念爲活動中心，以各校抗暴會爲基幹，以各大學爲活動對象，以造成流血事件爲目標，以繼續設動請願示成爲鬥爭方式」，所謂抗暴曾，即共匪民盟藉北平沈崇事件在各校策動職業學生組織之反美運動組織。</p>
<p>五四紀念日，羅隆基，章伯鈞，王紹　，施復亮，馬寅初等分赴京滬，杭各大中學演講，作公開之鼓動，其後即發生上海法學院「五四事件」，五月五六兩日，民盟滬市支部開會決定全力使此一事件擴大，以醖釀全面性之學潮。</p>
<p>自後新獲選之中大學生自治會人員，藉口「增發公費運動」再度掀起學潮，迄「五。二〇」發展至最高峯，在各地學潮進展過程中，京滬兩地民盟，不斷集合研究，指導學潮，使其集中於中共所提出之「反飢饑，反內戰，反征兵，反征糧」，等口號之下，京市民盟負責人在藍家莊暨梅園新邨重要會議，有三次，（五月十一日，廿五日，廿八日）滬市民盟支部在章伯鈞宅，王紹　宅，重要會議有二次，（五月廿四日，廿五日）。</p>
<p>「五，廿」學潮擴大後，民盟之黃炎培，羅隆基，章伯鈞等繼續以慰問金名義募集活動金七千餘萬元，中大罷課之第二日，（十四日）晚，施復亮自梅園新邨李相符處取去轉交中大學生自治會會中職業學生二百六十萬元，在學潮過程中，民盟京市辦事處，不斷有職業學生前往，民盟則派羅子為，金若年等，赴各校聯絡，章伯鈞。黃炎培。梁漱溟。馬寅初等亦輪流公開赴中大，金大等校演講，加以煽動，沈鈞儒，劉王立明等，則在上海以「由國國際人權保障會」名義，上書參政會抗議，民盟京辦事處與滬市支部，復發表「致谷校同學意見　」，「對於目前學生運動的意見」等文件，加强煽惑工作。</p>
<p>香港方面民盟南方總支部，於五月卅日發出詆辱政府之通電，並以「港九各界民主人士」名義，發出致各地學生之慰問電，復於六月一日召開「反對內戰促進和平大會」，出版「反丙戰」特刋，「「六二專號」，煽惑龍工。罷市。罷課。罷戰，鼓吹推翻政府，另組聯合政府。</p>
<p>三。學潮中發現之秘密文件　民盟勾結共匪，合力鼓動學潮，警憲機關除獲得情報外，並獲得秘密文件甚多，重要者如下三件：</p>
<p>二月間，廣州查獲共匪「國立中山大學反內戰反獨裁運動總結研究綱要」，說明該校二月學潮係民盟負實共匪協助</p>
<p>月問廣州査獲民盟南方總支部組織委員會於六月三日召開學運檢討會議後所發「關於港九學運的決定」一件，對港穗五月學潮有詳細檢討，並指示以後策動新學潮之方針。</p>
<p>六月間，上海查獲共匪上海市委六月十五日發「關於這次學運的總結及今後工作的指示」一件，設明京滬五月學潮係共匪領導，民盟出面，對「六二」，「總罷」陰謀及今後方針，暴露頗詳。</p>
<p>在東慶與成都警憲機關在應付「六二暴動」緊急處置時，所拘管之民盟人員，均已分別供認鼓動工潮。學潮。米潮。及爲共匪份子不諱。</p>
<p>戊。民盟破壞全國剿匪總動員令之活動</p>
<p>一。香港——自政府頒布剿匪戡亂總動員令以後，香港民盟南方總支部主委彭澤民，即於七月九日發表談話，宣傳民盟號召「以人民的總動員來對反政府的總動員」，同日民盟港九支部發表談話，宣稱「號召全港僑胞一致反對」，「抗拒總動員亂命」，「以全民總動員來反對政府的總動員」等話。</p>
<p>二。南京——八月，民盟羅隆基李相符等，以「中國人民及內戰大同盟」名義，撰印破壞總動員令煽動罷工罷市抗丁抗糧之傳單，傳單由李相符親筆修正，由局新民。羅隆基決定印發經盟員趙超凡良心發現，將原稿拍照後向中央黨部自首。</p>
<p>三，東北——匪新華社九月十八日廣播閻實航爲共匪「九一八」紀念特刋撰文，誣辱元首，號召東北人民支持叛亂，推翻政府。</p>
<p>四，新加坡——九月廿七日至廿九日，民主同盟在新加坡舉行第一屆全馬來亞代表大會，成立馬來亞支部，胡愈之主席，並宣稱「目前中共反對政府，我們也反對政府，中共主張建立民主政府，我們也主張建立聯合政府」，繼宣讀張瀾訓詞，大要爲反對國大，反對憲法，該會決議案中，有　通電擁議本盟中央新政策，　聲援祖國「人民解放戰爭」，以期早日實現聯合政府，　通電反對政府一切「賣國獨裁」罪行等項，閉幕胡愈之招待記者宣稱：爲達到推翻政府成立聯合政府之目的，民盟願與中國共產黨李濟琛等，及其他無黨派人士，共同鬥爭等語。</p>
<p>上述各節，指出民主同盟今已成爲反對憲法顚覆政府之陰謀暴動團體，其各地總支部之言論行動，已與共匪沆　一氣，毫無分別，其總部負責諸人，一面秘密從事地下工作，一面仍强作模棱之姿式以掩蔽其陰謀暴動，而混淆中外人士之視聽，現在山東共匪軍事完全失敗，晋冀匪軍傾巢南竄，企圖在河淮以南化整為零，避實就虛，以破壞社會秩序，動搖後方人心，而民盟更為其地下工作，與謠言攻勢之助手，實成爲後方社會安全之重大威脅。（全文完）</p>

<h3>紡聯理監事聯席會議　請延期實行配銷　研求合理方案務必雙方兼顧　指定八人小組今日繼續會商</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國紡聯會昨下午四時舉行理監事聯席會議，由理事長杜月笙氏親自主持。會議前補行就職典禮，由經濟部代表歐陽崙，社會部代表王家樹監　，儀式隆重。討論例案旣畢，六區公會代表臨時動議，討論棉紗聯合配銷問題，六區代表對該案發展經過，作口頭陳述後，以該案關係全國紡織業生產前途，常經交付討論。席上發言然烈，討論歷三小時許，其共同意見，認爲所謂憑證聯合配銷，　礙難行之處甚多，其主要者有三：</p>
<p>第一　所謂聯合配銷，預定爲「憑證」配售制。但在目前生產消費失去平衡之局勢下，憑證配銷之條件，實未具備。全國普遍實施，旣有困難，若僅在上海一地實施，更有失平允。若各地複製業紗商紛紛要求給證配售，則糾紛必多，事實上難有善果。</p>
<p>第二　關於價格問題，紡調會對聯配綱要之解釋，與統配統銷方式，相去無幾，而決非同業問之眞正聯配。其決定似格之權，全操在政府。若政府之目的僅在平價，則在目前生產不振，供不應求之情况下，仍必越平越高，而距紗廠之再生產條件，則更難接近。對於議價之決定權，全操諸政府一點，紡織同業認爲最大之困難。</p>
<p>第三　紗廠開貨，原有各自謀取流通，適應市况，以求自然之意義存在。若所有產紗，硬性由政府收繳，必致週磚失靈，阻塞不調，在此生產未臻穩定，銀根時虞擱淺之時，同業對此，多感惶惑，認爲窒礙難行。至各廠將喪失其營業權一點，猶其餘事。</p>
<p>根據以上三項不可解決之困難，該會對聯合配銷問題，決議請政府寬延時日，重加考慮，務求得一能兼顧政府國策與紗廠生產之合理可行的方案。即席推定王啓宇，吳味經，劉靖基，唐星海，張文潛，榮爾仁，朱扶九，章劍　等八人，舉行小組會議，擬具方案，供政府採擇，以謀折衷疏導，俾獲合理解決。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕杜月笙氏於紡聯曾理監事會議散後，以理事長身份，往紡調會訪劉代主委泗英，報吿該會經過情形後，即返會繼續召開小組談話會，歷時甚久，聞今日將繼續商議。</p>
<p>民營廠方交換意見</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會，昨午舉行常務理事例會，席間交換關於聯合配銷問題意見，會後由該會發言人接見記者談，聯合配銷辦法，紡織界是否接受，將由全國紡織聯合會理事會議加以討論。該會將由杜理事長月笙，親自主持。預料可有具體意見，以備折衝。</p>
<h3>人造絲疲憊　再降二百餘萬元</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市依然疲憊，綢廠以綢價平疲，均鮮有採納，而執貨者則因銀根由鬆轉緊，頗有抛售。午收各檔一致軋降，一二〇東洋七六〇〇萬，再低二五〇萬，一二〇號難牌有光在七五〇〇萬至七五五〇萬之間，均跌二百萬以上，上午成交近十箱。</p>
<p>絲市繼續下游，人心更形虛軟，同業銀根又奇緊，執戶遂紛抛售，而散戶欲吸乏力。晨開，BDC各級再一致下挫二百萬元，午收做開另担十祖，價六千萬元。輯里千經，特上廿八分，隨挫二百萬元，普通跌入四千萬關內，做開另担五担，價三千六百萬元。</p>
<h3>全日交易稀少　四十二支藍鳳較上日略降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會棉紗議價，昨日未動，廿支紗仍維持一八九〇萬元原價。</p>
<p>中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售九三三件，合廿支紗一三〇九件，全部售予廠商，申購單二五六張。</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開市勢徘徊，塲內做開稀少，本街染織廠辦胃零星，客帮稍有進取，最後四二支藍鳳紗比上日　降十萬爲三千三百五十萬元，廿支輕雙馬回升十五萬元，其他各支粗細紗互有一·二十萬元升沉。</p>
<p>布疋平定</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，同業欲進無力，客帮採辦亦懈，實需不暢，塲內斬售不寂，龍頭細布仍爲八十六萬五千元，五福彩球藍鷄等回好五千至二萬元，當令繁銷之嗶嘰元直貢，亦升五千至一萬五千元，其他各布市呈平疲。</p>
<p>現棉平庸</p>
<p>昨日現棉因銀根緊急買戶觀望，市况一度稍疲，價格較上日回軟。嗣以棉紗稍好，紗廠略有納胃，疲勢重振，交易活躍，成交以同業居多，各檔成交一二四〇包。送廠價做開靈寳三七三萬一千，沙市三五八萬，漢細三四四萬七千，成交三百包。</p>
<h3>食米下挫麺粉步跌</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬零一百餘石，市勢一蹶不振，早市狂跌不已，午時店方乘巧納取，略呈轉定，結果粳米仍軋跌二萬餘元，秈米再低二三萬元。杜羊秈猛挫三四萬元，早薄稻狂落三四萬元。白元步削二三萬元，陰元出貨漸湧，去化呆木，暴落三五萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉無鍻來貨　旺，步跌八九千元。麩皮亦然脩削一二千元。午時廠方關照所存麵粉棧單，限於三天内出淸，人心更覺虛軟。豆餅交易稀少乏交而少神。黃豆到源漸多，油廠冷懈，本街依然猛殺，客帮成交不濃，議挫萬餘元。</p>
<p>莰豆南洋去胃不擬，挫落萬餘元，　豆另星略動，萎聲不振。莞豆汕頭收購，挺升一二萬元。缸豆南洋拾取，市勢站立。紅糧酒坊有動，暫成平定之格。</p>
<p>苞米北方揀高採納，形則高俏次呆之象。生仁廣帮停辦，頓形呆滯，回跌四五萬元。芝蔴客帮洋莊均吿停進，本街遇巧略取，價格步跌二萬元。</p>
<p>油市節節下挫，生油趨降三五萬元，豆油再低一二萬元，菜油平平，淸油彷彿，蔴油亦少上落</p>
<h3>無錫米價續瀉</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿九日電〕今日米市又跌，新粳五七萬四，至六十萬零四千。羊秈四七萬，白麥五四萬，杜麥四九萬八，開封黃荳四九萬六。聞見跌原因，（一）上海客商就近在浦東等處採辦，（二）到貨奇多，行棧堆積如山，（三）丹從有米稻船一千三百餘艘，及常州奔牛間又有大批貨船，均擬來錫，內秈米獨多，市情將見　瀉。</p>

<p>〔本報天津廿九日電〕中美救濟協定簽字後津糧價首吿下跌小袋局粉每袋落萬餘元，大米落一二百元，其他物價亦疲。</p>
<h3>解決紗廠原料恐慌印棉易紗開始登記</h3>
<p>本市各民營紗廠，前曾建議政府，向印度購辦印棉，以接濟目前之棉花恐慌事，刻正由紡織品外銷委員會在統籌辦理中。昨據該會負責人談稱：目前向印度購棉，決定採取以貨易貨方式，我國以棉紗向印度易棉，雙方亦已商定，每包二十支之棉紗，可易得一千〇五十至一千一百二十磅之印棉。易回之棉花，以七百五十五磅交與紗廠，作抵償棉紗之用，多餘之數，其中百分之六十歸中央銀行，以代替結匯之費用等，百分之四十再撥予民營紗廠，作爲盈利。此項易貨辦法，該會現已開始登記，迄目前止，已登記之廠商有十四家，年內可望成功第一次易貨。至棉紗運往印度，及棉花運來中國之運輸問題，雙方商定採用輪船運載，因空運及公路運輸之費用較鉅也。</p>
<h3>捲菸原料登記　廠商要求優先承購</h3>
<p>自政府公佈自備外匯到埠物資處理辦法後，中國捲菸工業協會鑒於中國物資之缺乏，捲菸原料，時虞中斷，旣經到埠原料，已屬中國人民之物資，倘不幸任其重運出口，豈僅我捲菸工業之損失，亦爲我國家之損失。經於本月廿三日舉行理監事聯席會，討論關於自備外匯到埠物資登記一案。議決一致擁護國策，首先申請登記，聽候政府處理，惟爲維護本業之生存起見，所有登記之捲菸原料，要求政府體恤商艱，准由捲菸廠商直接優先承購，並提前辦理云。</p>
<p>又訊，無許可證自備外匯到埠及起運貨品，其中已登記之到埠菸葉爲「一一二，〇九四，八六美元」，捲菸紙一，一六五，八八一，六八美元。</p>
<h3>粵省昨起嚴查海陸空運　取締京滬現鈔南流　廣州市上游資已向香港轉逃</h3>

<p>〔聯合社廣州廿九日電〕數日來此間日用品價格步漲，以米為尤甚。薪水階級大感困惱。十日以來，米價自每担（一百十磅）法幣三十二萬元漲至四十一萬元，其他物品漲起四成至七成不等。漲價之一部份原因乃港幣在一個月內，漲起一倍以上之故。據當局統計，本月中旬之物價爲一九三七年時之六萬四千五百倍，即法幣萬元等於一九三七年時之一角五分五厘。</p>
<h3>個人申請外匯須轉國行核辦</h3>

<p>晨初</p>
<p>甚為恍惚，各股開出榮辱互見。永紗自二九二元及二九四元開後，成交極稀，退至二八九元及二九〇元。旋又退至二八七元及二八八元。雖經支持，略有回上，場外息價開高少許，爲一角九分半及二角四，但市况未獲改進。迨後聞塲外有潮帮大戶敲進一億餘股之訊，廣幫來買即交，並有進遞交者，而回漲到即交二九四元，遞交二九六元高價。不久又不脫疲態，近午退至二八六元及二八七元低價，午收爲二八六元及二八八元。除冷門者外，均被帶小少許。結果較前收即交股，計中法中紡五和各跌半成，商務大通內衣火柴微升，水泥景綸信誼尙平，永紗信和美亞華豐新光景福勤興新華新亞麗安中絲統益榮豐恒豐閘北華新微降。遞交股計勤興獨平，餘均微挫。</p>

<p>外股昨熱股平平，冷股及橡皮股搜羅者多，頰見俏利。證券帮散戶均進，洋行帮及銀行帮俱售，恰紗始終在二十萬與二十一萬間徘徊不定。結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豐怡啤祥泰俱平，墾植獨漲二成，航業鋼業升半成，餘者榮辱俱徽。</p>

<h3>東西文化之會流</h3>
<p>— 傅統先</p>
<p>Northrop：The　Meeting　of　east　and　WestThe　MacMillan　Co.</p>
<p>這是美國在戰後出版的一本水準較高的學術思想方面的大著，作者耶魯大學哲學敎授納斯樂。他的主題是如何會合東西文化以求人類彼此的了解，而達到眞正的世界和平</p>
<p>一般人以爲第二次世界戰爭在人類的心理上和第一次戰爭不同，他以爲在第一次世界戰爭中並沒有思想上的矛盾。當時的戰爭是爲民主主義而戰，後來德　失敗，民主似乎是勝利了。之後，却發現了並不是那一回事，那次戰爭的意義大家仍是不了解。至於這一次戰爭，大家都看得出處處全是思想的街突。誰都明白和平的命運全靠傳統的民主主義和蘇聯的共產主義能否在它們的政治，經濟，宗敎方而的主張相互調協而彼此眞能合作。但是作者以爲這還不是唯一的思想衝突，更不是最重要的一個思想衝突。</p>
<p>在巴勒斯坦猶太人的信仰和阿刺伯人的文化是格格不入；在印度，回敎徒的社會觀和印度敎徒的社會觀是水火不容。在歐洲，羅馬天主敎的貴族思想和道穗觀念和新敎基督徒的平民思想和人本主義也是兩相衝突的，同樣，在東方，日本的神道信仰和儒家佛敎的中正慈悲思想不能融洽。在美洲，傳統的拉丁美洲觀點和傳統盎格羅美洲觀點亦不能一致。總之，在各種不同的文化問其經濟政治哲學此以爲是者彼以爲非；此以爲非者彼以為是。思想衝突，意識型態不同，遍於世界。此種矛盾衝突，若不加以根除，世界將永無寗靜之日。</p>
<p>這些問題無法在實際情况下獲得解決，我們要追本溯源，從理論上作詳盡而客觀的檢討，以求得一個正確的認識。本書就是想從一方而下工夫的。根據作者初步分析的結果，這些思　衝突的總根源乃是東方文化和西方文化的衝突。因此，現在的基本問題是如何使東西文化會流。這一個衝突解決之後，其他的思想衝突都可以迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>本書根據這個主題而把全部内容分成兩大部分。第一部分是　西方的文化。西方文化被分爲六大支流：　墨西哥的雙富文化，它本身也是一個複雜的文化混合體，它包括有古代阿茲特的意味，西班牙殖民地的風土，十九世紀法蘭西的情調，北美洲的經濟和現代壘西哥的風采；　美利堅合衆國的自由文化；　英國獨特的民主主義的文化；　德國唯心論的文化；　蘇聯共產主義的文化；　羅馬天主敎的文化。這許多文化在內容方面雖各有不同，但是它們却是屬於回一形式的。無論在哲學，宗敎，乃至於科學方面，西方文化的知劉内容都不是絕對的和最後的，而是變動的和改進的。作者認爲這可以迫溯到兩個基木的理由。第一，西方的科學，哲學和宗敎的知識都不是從直覺的觀感方面得來的。這種知識乃是根據觀察而預擬一個假放，再搜羅證據，加以推演。因此，第二，西方的知識一定有一連串的邏輯的推理。根據這兩個特點，我們知道西方的文化乃是理論的，符號的，間接的。</p>
<p>本書的第二部分是講東方的文化。東方文化可以分成三大支流：　中國儒家和這家的文化；　日本的神道文化；　印度的佛敎文化。東方人對於一切事物和自然界都是）用種情緖的和直觀的方式去體會的。東方人和自然是混爲一體的，所謂「萬物一體，物我兩忘」，這是東方文化的精神。因此，東方人對於事物的本然也有兩個基本概念。第一，自然界是一個直觀的混然一體，這個混然一體是一切的人類和一切的事物所共享的；第二，在這個混然一體中我們直接感覺到各種的分別。根據這兩個特點，我們知道東方的文化乃是美感的，體會的，直觀的。</p>
<p>本書作者以爲一切藝術可以分成兩類。第一類的藝術是運用直觀的混然一體做爲美感材料，把它本身直接的表達出來，純粹是為　術而藝術的。第一類的藝術是運用理論的方法和技巧把這種直觀的迎　體做為美感材料，而以之傳達事物的關係，它是一種符號或工具，用為傳遞外物的。西方文化，無論其哲學，科學，經濟，政治，藝術，都屬於第二類的藝術型；東方文化在各方面都屬於第一類的藝術型。但是我們對於一切事物自然的認識不僅要有直觀的體會，也應有理論的分析。將來的新的世界觀，一方而要有直觀美感的材料，把它自身直接表現出來，一方面也要有邏輯推理的方式把直觀原料用符號表達出來。這兩方面並非矛盾而是並行不悖的；非但是並行不悖的，而且是相輔相成的。</p>
<p>因此，照作者的看法，東西文化的會流並不是全盤西化或全盤東化，這兩支文化將會合爲一新的世界文化，它包括有直觀的因素，也包括有理論的因素。這時候的個人不僅是一個單純直覺的自我；也不僅是一個由科學所證實而爲理論所認知的自我。個人一方面有其直觀的本然，未曾分化而與四周人物所共存的現實自我；另一方而有其邏輯的本然，在一種社會組織的關係中有其特殊功能的抽象目我。因此，在這個主張有兩端關係的認知作用（the　two-tremed　relationof　epistemic　correlation）的哲學奠定了未來世界文化的基石。</p>
<p>作者納斯樂敎授學識淵博，思想深刻，文筆流俐。對於各國文化瞭如指掌。西方思想家對於墨西哥文化有深刻分析者不多見，而納氏繪影繪形，途途是進，　後使人對墨西哥有一深刻影響。關於我國現狀亦甚明白，分析方面欲求完全現代西方式的國家，另一方面又深受有幾千年歷史的東方家族思想之影響，以致到今　為彷徨混亂，似乎還不能在世界文化中打出一條出路！此點，我們中國的學者也曾見到。可見東西學者所見相同。因此我們希望東西兩方面的學者們能在文化思想方面不妨先來一個大的團結，從溝通東西文化入手，創造一個新的世界文化，這纔是消滅戰爭，尋求世界和平最根本的辦法。　十月二十日</p>
<h3>英譯中華民國憲法平凡</h3>
<p>中華民國憲法已由中央社的郝志翔先生羅爲英文，本年九月在商務發行單行本。書的格式是中英對照的。文字正確而流俐，使世界人士都能認識這部世界最新成立的憲法。同時學習英文的中國人士也能學習這種有現實性的英文。英譯本和原文有三個不同的地方，這是譯者認爲在英文方面這樣表達比　的合理。</p>
<p>第一條原文稱：「中華民國基於三民主義爲民有民治民享之民主共和國。」「民有民治民享」一語木來是美國大總統林背的一句成語，立法時原有主張不川這一句西洋味太濃的辭語。可是譯者並沒有把它譯爲原來的“of　the　people,　by　the　people,for　the　people”而譯為：「of　the　people　for　the　people　and　governed　by　the　people」。因爲譯者以林肯原文只能對于於政府而言，不能對於國家而言。</p>
<p>第八條原文有：「非依法定程序之逮捕拘謹，審問，處罰，得拒絕之。」譯者以爲假使一個人遭受逮捕，拘禁，審問，處罰的時候，他在身體上是無法拒絕的，頂多他只能作一種精神上的拒絕，所以譯者以爲最好用「抗戰」（Pro　lested）辭。但因原文的意思是拒絕而非抗議的意思，譯者也只好譯refused</p>
<p>「複決」釋爲referedna，這是因爲譯者要忠於原文的開係，其實，他以爲最好譯爲「ratify」或「vota　on」</p>
<p>全文非常忠賞於原文，這是英譯憲法的特點。不過有兩個地方我們願與譯者商椎的。（一）中文的「得」字譯爲may這是對的，因爲這意思是說：「可以這樣，但不一定要這樣。」但是「不得」則含有强制性的，所以不能譯爲「may　nto」，因爲這是說：「可以不這樣，但也可以這樣」。所以我們覺得最好用「shall」（二）第一三五條原文「內地生活習慣特殊之國民代一表」edlegates　to　theNational　Assenbly　fromirterior　areas　having　pecliar　conditions　of　living　and　habits。這有兩點不妥，第一，國民代表並非單指國民大會代表而係指各種的國民代表，似應譯為delegates　of　the　people第二，peCuliar一字不妥，有時此字可作「奇怪」的意思而不一定是「特殊」的意思，似應譯為particuar不知譯者以為如何？</p>
<h3>介紹「袖珍中國分省精圖」</h3>
<p>— 公佩萱</p>
<p>（增訂十二版金擎宇編製亞光與地學社出版）</p>
<p>中國人的地械觀念很深，但對於地理的知識很差，這是一般的通病。因爲地械觀念深，所以養成故土難離的習性，因爲有故土難離的習性，所以胸襟難得廣闊，因之，地理知識的求得慾也就越發的不足了。但是，時代一天天的進步，科學突飛猛晋，人類生存的空問日漸减小，現在已不容許我們棲息在某個狹小的圈子裏茍安偸生了，所以，地理知識的灌輸乃是我們應有的常識，生存在這個時代的人類，對於地理的知識是不可不學習的。</p>
<p>在國內，找一本精確的世界地圖，幾乎是一件難事，而找一本精確詳明的本國地圖，比較着也不很容易。這一本亞光　地學社出版，金擎宇先生編製的袖珍中國分省精圖，雖然也不是盡滿人意之作，但比較是可以備作參考之用的圖籍。</p>
<p>現在，先說它的可取之處：　這本地圖自民國三十年出到十二版後　增訂本現在也出到十二版，在最近的一次增訂版裏，它能隨時把人文方面的變動加以訂正，使這本地圖成爲最合時代　要的作品，給予國人所注目的個方一明確的認識。如東北九省地和外蒙古，唐努島梁海等。　各省分圖，對於比較大的集鎭都有標示，位置也相當正確，這是件很不容易辦到的事，依筆者數年來　歷的各省市，凡所經過的集鎭，和這地圖上的位置相較，大體上都能符合。　這本地圖名爲「袖珍「，當然篇幅很小，易於呌人携帶；做到篇幅小，任何圖籍都可辦到，但要做得週到，却不是任何圖籍都能辦到的了。本圖在週的方面，大體上還算可以過得去。</p>
<p>不過，這本地圖是一本普通參考地圖，不是學者專家或軍事所用的地圖，求其樣樣完備，也不是客觀的態度。譬如說：　分圖中對於地勢就沒有詳明的表示。　分圖中對於物產地也沒有特別標明。　直轄市附在分圖之内。　歷年國土的喪失也沒有加以標明。　都是呌人不甚滿意的地方。</p>
<p>基於以上種種，所以我們對於這本地岡的要求，希望於十三版時改正下列四點：　分　加繪地形地勢；這點，在投影時也許有困難，但坊問若干地圖都已做到。　要把各省物產的產地或儲藏地鮮明的表示出來。　凡屬行政院直轄市，都應該繪製專頁，以顯示其重要性，並加深國人的認　。　中國歷年失地不少，几所失地，似乎也應該詐加標明，這對於增進國人的民族意識是大有禆益的。</p>
<p>這本圖籍出版在本年二月，那時東北九省及南海疆界還有待調整，現在內政部已明令劃定東北九省的省界，再版時自然要加以訂正，南海的西沙羣島，似乎也有勘定後有專頁才好，因爲那是　處海外的邊疆，應該加強國人的注意。此外，筆者　希望編製者能够遵照國父的實業計劃，標出我們建國的方略來，對於請者也是很有敎育意義的。</p>
<p>至於本圖的微末瑕疵，筆者認爲說明過於簡略，而錯落字又為在少，如山柬分圖的說明文中，把「　」縣的坊子，弄成「肥」縣的坊子，別說坊子不在「肥」縣，而山東亦僅有一「肥城」而並無「肥縣」。</p>
<h3>「莫扎特」給我的啓示</h3>
<p>— 菲瓊</p>
<p>「愛，搖我的心，如山風落在　樹的中問。</p>
<p>「愛，搖動我，——融化肢體的愛，苦甜，不可抗的物。</p>
<p>——坡弗：「寄所愛」</p>
<p>讀完了B，拔拉希的三幕劇「莫扎特」，忽然記起了希臘女詩人　坡弗的詩。——我的心感到了一陣搖　。</p>
<p>是這偉大藝人莫扎特的身世感動了我麼？不，不懂是這個，更感動我的倒是他的姐妹的無言的犧牲。</p>
<p>一個在貧窮之家長成的人，一個除了赤心之外一無所有的人，他犧牲了他自己作爲藝術的祭品，也必然的使他的父親，他的姐妹（南內兒，莫扎特）也隨同了他而默默犧牲。</p>
<p>我說是「必然」，眞的丙爲我已在這幾個偉大的人性前屈服了。——「愛」搖動我，壓倒了我的自私和漠然。</p>
<p>也是　坡弗的詩：「看起來是美的，必是善的，善的也將是美的了。」</p>
<p>善良的南內兒在全劇中決不是一個主角，但她控住了我，她對她的弟弟的偉大的愛搖動了我。當她父親和她說：「南内兒……我曉得……我什麽都曉得……至於我，一個上了年紀的人犧牲了自己的生命，這不算一回事；可是，當你犧牲了你的靑春和愛情，犧牲了你的幸福和音樂技能，這又是一件事呀！」（沙　　本頁九）</p>
<p>一個老人終生抄按樂　，爲了他的兒子；一個有音樂天才的少女整天到晚地編織着花邊，爲了她的弟弟。「善的也將是美的」，所以即使老人在第二幕中向他的兒子說了些不合時宜的話，但那也是他的權利，因爲他已竭盡了力量與他的凝務。</p>
<p>「善的也是美的，」我乃更崇敬南內兒。當她父親信用破了產，她紅着臉，却堅強地勇敢地低聲說了：「我簽這張借約；我簽……我可以拿我的嫁妝費担保。」她還是一個少女啊，我却不能不認爲她是一個大勇者。</p>
<p>我還沒有談到莫扎特，不，我已經　到他了。在這樣的家庭里成長起來。在這樣的東的　圍中成長起來，天才的莫扎特是應該有一個更輝煌的前途的。</p>
<p>我們欣賞莫扎特的音樂，我們却忘懷了莫扎特本人就是一件完美的藝術品，——一幅畫，一首安魂曲，一個善良無疵的靈魂。</p>
<p>但社會迫害了他。當劇院爲了演奏他的樂曲而大發其財。當少女阿洛西亞爲了歌唱他的樂曲而一舉成名，甚至當一個乞丐在街上演奏他的樂曲而獲得了麵包時，我們的天才音樂家莫扎特却爲了幾個　　里特（奧幣）在受難。</p>
<p>（乞丐又開始演奏，莫扎特看着他，走上前，把他的提琴拿過來）。莫扎特：老先生，借給我用一下。（開始演奏）</p>
<p>音樂啊，要是沒有你，我曾變成什麽樣子？　，音樂啊，音樂啊……</p>
<p>（他演奏着，乞丐感動地，用他兩隻看不見的眼睛轉向他，過路人聚攏來：銀幣雨一般地落在他的帽子裏）。</p>
<p>莫扎特：哪，老先生，你還演奏吧，我的惡運會過去的，我的看樂將永久存在。</p>
<p>乞丐：（迷惑地）你是誰？哪一位？莫扎特：一個當今的紅人……你的一個夥伴，一個同你一樣的瞎的瞎子兼音樂家，晚安，老先生。</p>
<p>（莫扎特離去，他　沒在黑夜裏，盲者走了幾步，兩手向前探伸着，彷彿在摸索着，要跟隨莫扎特走去）。</p>
<p>莫扎特把自己稱這瞎子兼音樂家，他多少還有點自知之明，杜斯妥也夫斯基曾批評託爾斯泰說：托爾斯泰是一個正義感洋溢的俄國人，他有他的慧眼，然而，他只能向前面看，永遠不淸楚旁邊的一切。</p>
<p>莫扎特也無視於週遭的環境，不了然於人世的陰冷可怕，直到死時，也還沒有失去他的鄲城。社會的迫害毀了他的形體，而他的善良的心一直是溫暖的。他苦鬥着，無視於社會的迫害，因此，他自己說是一個瞎子。</p>
<p>他無視，當他的戀人阿洛西亞向劇塲老板獻媚；他無視；當阿洛西亞的母親威拜爾太太玩弄着卑鄙的手段，，他無視，當依靠他而發財的人們包圍住他，　他寫出最後的幾隻樂曲來。——一個純眞的善良者，永遠想不到世界有這麽殘酷，他不得不無視。</p>
<p>臨死時，地　於吐出了幾句控訴：</p>
<p>「不要要，蘇斯　兩，死並不是我的仇敵，如果它無情地阻止我完成最後這一章……它是音樂的仇敵」！</p>
<p>才卅五歲呵，他就像那隻銜着橄欖枝的白鴿，飛在不潔的水波之上，他的兩翼已經疲倦了，在人間陰冷的迫害下，他　了下來，沉入不潔的水波里。這就是一個純眞，可愛。偉大的靈魂的下塲！</p>

<h3>US Aid Plan to China Approved; Relief Bill to be Submitted to Congress; Wang Shijie Returns to Nanjing, Holds Extensive Talks with Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, on the 28th, responded to Chairman Chiang's summons to Gu, reporting on his attendance at the UN General Assembly during his absence from the country, as well as discussions with White House officials. After four days of observations in Tokyo, he flew back to the capital by special plane at 5:15 PM on the 29th. That evening, at around 9:00 PM, he met with President Zhang at his official residence, talking late into the night before departing. It is widely believed that the issue of US aid was the central focus of Wang's discussions with Chairman Chiang and President Zhang. According to authoritative sources speaking to our reporter, Wang's extensive talks with President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Under Secretary of State Lovett in the United States have led the White House to have a deep understanding and concern about the current situation in China. It is possible that an understanding regarding aid to China was reached when Secretary Marshall met with Foreign Minister Wang in New York on October 14th for an extended conversation. The statement issued by the US State Department regarding its decision not to release the Wedemeyer Report in its entirety indicated that it was preparing to take action in the Far East. Recent widespread reports that the US government approved the Wedemeyer Report and its recommendations on October 21st are highly plausible. In principle, there are no longer any issues regarding US aid to China; the only remaining questions are the method and timing of concrete action. Regarding the former, the attention of the current Chinese government is not focused on loans, as experience has shown that the support provided by loans is short-lived and insufficient. Moreover, China's urgent need is not the portion of international payment loans that can be provided, and temporary economic stability is insufficient to eliminate the rebellion of the Communist bandits. It is certain that the authorities in China and the United States have agreed that military supplies and materials are the only effective means to strengthen suppression and stabilize society. According to this source, Pulitzer's proposals are quite practical in this regard. Under the current circumstances, the US military advisory group finds it extremely difficult to carry out its work, and expanding the organization is a necessary step. As for the timing of US aid to China, the source believes that some measures within President Truman's authority are expected before November 17th, but large-scale assistance will not be implemented until a decision has been made on the Marshall Plan for Europe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] Sources with authority in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed today that President Truman approved the plan to aid China on October 21st, the content of which is similar to the recommendations made by Pulitzer in his report on his trip to China published in Life magazine, including military and economic aid. According to Pulitzer's recommendations, $1.35 billion would be provided to China over three years, under US supervision and management.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Representative Bloom, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a Democratic Congressman, stated that he believes the relief bill to be submitted to the special session of Congress next month will include China. Whether China needs the same relief as other countries will be debated in Congress at the same time. Furthermore, according to sources in the State Department, the relief bill currently being drafted does not include China. The news also stated that a separate bill to aid China may be introduced during the regular session of Congress this winter, but it is often considered separately from the relief for Europe.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Dr. Henry, President of Lingnan University, warned the American people that if they do not aid China at this critical juncture, the United States will lose a great friend when China becomes the strongest nation in the Far East in the near future. Henry is in the United States to raise a fund of $100,000 for the United Christian Universities of China. In a speech he delivered yesterday at the Optimist Club, he said that the Chinese people are a great nation with traditional friendship towards the United States. He emphasized the courage of the Chinese people during the war, citing several examples to illustrate how Chinese farmers helped the American army in China. He told reporters that he will stay in the United States for several months before returning to Lingnan University.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Vice Minister Ye Gongchao stated that according to the Sino-American relief agreement signed on the 27th of this month, the relief supplies provided by the United States to the Chinese people are valued at approximately $30 million. Detailed information on the implementation of US relief in China will be announced as soon as it is completed and approved.</p>
<h3>Member of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, Judd Arrives in Nanjing from Beiping, Visits President Zhang This Afternoon, Flies to Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] Representative Judd (see photo), a member of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, arrived here by special plane from Beiping at about 1:00 PM on the 29th. Ambassador Stuart, General Rooks, Rear Admiral Moule and others, as well as Ling Qiyu, Director of the Protocol Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all went to the Dajiaochang base to welcome him. After disembarking, Judd was accompanied by the ambassador to his official residence on Shanghai Road for rest, where he had extensive talks with the ambassador and embassy staff. He dined with the ambassador and others at 8:00 PM. Judd plans to stay in Nanjing for two days and fly to Shanghai on the 31st, before returning to Nanjing for a third visit next month to meet with Chairman Chiang. He is scheduled to call on President Zhang Qun at 11:00 AM on the 30th. They are old friends from Chengdu. Upon his arrival here, Judd told those who welcomed him that he was very happy to meet with Zhang. He will meet with Foreign Minister Wang in the afternoon at 7:00 PM and attend a banquet. It is reported that, in order to understand the current situation in our country, Judd will interact with people from all walks of life in our country as much as possible. Vice President Sun Ke and Guangdong Provincial Chairman Song Ziwen will also be his informal interviewees. Judd has been in China for many years and is a good friend of the Chinese people. The report he writes based on the information he obtains this time will definitely be of great benefit to the understanding and friendship between China and the United States.</p>
<h3>Children in Washington Schools to Raise Food for Us</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Children in local schools will go to various homes on the 31st for Halloween (Halloween is the name of a beggar) to raise food for relief organizations in China and other countries, instead of asking for candy as in the past. According to past custom, children from schools often went to various homes to ask for candy on this day. If they were not given any, the doors and windows were often broken, or the walls were smeared with dirt. A local school is currently raising food for Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] It was announced here that Mr. Berlin, the treasurer of the United China Relief, will lead the organization's New York committee in the final fundraising campaign of 1947 to carry out the organization's plans for education, health, and childcare, such as "Helping China to Automate". The fundraising campaign will begin on November 5th and last until the end of November. Berlin said that he is confident that the campaign will achieve its goal of $500,000.</p>
<h3>Women with Permed Hair in Qingdao Must Donate Money to the Military</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Qingdao, 29th] The Qingdao Military Comfort Association decided yesterday on a measure to comfort the troops. Women with permed hair should pay a military comfort donation of 20,000 yuan, and a receipt will be issued for identification purposes. Teams will be dispatched to conduct patrols and inspections on various roads.</p>
<h3>Australian Minister Plenipotentiary Explains Australia's Policy Principles Towards Japan; Guarantees Pacific Security Will Not Be Subjected to Japanese Aggression; Gradually Reforms Japan and Establishes a Democratic System</h3>
<p>[News Report] Australian Minister Plenipotentiary to China, Professor Copland, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. At 4:00 PM, he held a press conference at the Hua Mao Hotel to explain Australia's policy towards Japan, focusing on two major principles: The first is to guarantee the security of the Pacific region, so that it will no longer be subjected to Japanese aggression. Therefore, Japan must be disarmed, freed from militarism, and its ability to wage war destroyed. Japan has already lost the ability to wage war in the short term, but there must still be appropriate supervision in the future; Australia strongly advocates the establishment of a supervisory body in which all eleven countries that fought against Japan can participate. The second is to establish a democratic system in Japan through the gradual reform of political, social, and economic institutions. Merely formulating a constitution and holding elections cannot fundamentally change the social institutions of Japan, but such a thorough change is necessary if Japan is to become a truly democratic country. Therefore, the establishment of international supervision is necessary. Professor Copland answered the questions raised by the reporters as follows: (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>50,000 Yuan Notes Have Never Appeared in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Xi'an, 29th] Regarding Lou Tongsun's previous revelation that 50,000 yuan notes, a portion of 100 billion, would first be used to purchase cotton in remote provinces, our reporter recently learned from six relevant official and financial institutions in Xi'an that the quota for cotton transport and sales loans in Shaanxi this year, handled through the Cooperative Treasury, is 100 billion. However, this amount has not yet been remitted, so it is difficult to predict what kind of banknotes will be used for payment in the future. A certain party also stated firmly that the treasuries of various units here have not yet received such new banknotes. Another party believes that issuing new large-denomination banknotes in Shaanxi first would not be of much significance, as the financial activities here are closely related to those in Nanjing and Shanghai, and the demand for large-denomination banknotes in the financial center is greater than in Shaanxi. Furthermore, the special funds previously allocated by the China Textile Corporation for purchasing new cotton here have not yet been used due to the difficulty of sea transport.</p>
<h3>Britain Supports Early Convening of a Peace Conference with Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th, United Press] A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that Britain supports the early convening of a peace conference with Japan, and said: "I do not know what position the British government will take if the Soviet Union refuses to participate in an early peace conference."</p>
<h3>Korea Should Gain Independence Soon; Gu Weijun Speaks at the UN Political Committee; Urges US and Soviet Union to Strive for a Solution</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 28th] Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun spoke on the Korean issue at the UN Political Committee, requesting that the United States and the Soviet Union make another effort to resolve the Korean issue themselves. Gu believes that, for the sake of fairness, the solution to the Korean issue should not wait until the final resolution of the Japanese peace treaty. Gu stated that China agrees in principle with the US proposal and said that the Korean people should gain independence as quickly as possible. Before the troops withdraw from Korea, the following indispensable conditions must be met: The establishment of a provisional Korean democratic government; The organization of methods to maintain law and order; The occupying countries must guarantee that Korea will not fall into a vacuum and face the danger of civil war after the withdrawal of troops. Gu also stated that the Chinese government is prepared to agree to any conditions stipulated by the UN agencies, but must first seek the opinions of the four powers concerned, namely China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The US representative Dulles proposed: Early election of a Korean National Assembly; The National Assembly organizes a Korean National Government; The National Government receives the powers of the South and North Korean governments in an orderly manner; Withdrawal of all occupying forces; All of the above steps are implemented under the supervision of UN agencies. When reviewing the US-Soviet negotiations over the past two years, Dulles specifically pointed out two points: When the United States proposed on August 26th of this year that the four powers of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union hold a meeting to break the deadlock, the Soviet Union refused. When the United States announced that it would submit the matter to the United Nations mechanism, the Soviet Union suddenly announced that it was prepared to withdraw its troops in January next year. Dulles pointed out that the Soviet Union's troop withdrawal proposal is not a suitable solution, because there are currently two governments with completely different forms in North and South Korea. The Soviet Union did not explain how these two different forms could be connected before the troop withdrawal.</p>

Because of the importance of promoting culture, the newspapers had applied to the Executive Yuan for difficulties and requested that the reduction not be made temporarily. However, after discussion by the Thrift Committee today, it was still believed that the order must be implemented and not changed.</p>
<h3>Yulin Launches Defense War; Communist Bandits Occupy Heights Outside the City; Airfield Difficult to Use</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Zhangjiakou, 29th] Military News: The defense war of Yulin in northern Shaanxi has restarted, and fierce fighting has been taking place in the suburbs for days.

<h3>Members of the Underground Democratic League Should Register with the Security Authorities; Dong Xian Guang Declares at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Director Dong Xianguang of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, in response to inquiries about the Democratic League at a press conference on the 29th, stated: The activities of the Democratic League and its branches, which have already been declared illegal, will naturally be prohibited. As for its individual members, if there is no excessive behavior and they can abide by government laws and decrees, there is no need to worry. There are currently many members of the Democratic League who are hiding underground. If they can be reasonable and law-abiding, they should register with the local security authorities. As for Luo Longji and others, regardless of whether they register or not, everyone knows that they are members of the Democratic League.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] Huang Yanpei of the Democratic League specifically visited Zhang Qun on the 29th. They believe that the Democratic League can obey the order to dissolve, but there are several matters that must be handled before the dissolution. Therefore, they expressed dissatisfaction with the current situation of being under surveillance and specifically negotiated with Zhang Qun to request the lifting of the surveillance. According to Huang, Zhang Qun has indicated that the agencies under his command will lift the surveillance of the Democratic League, but as of the evening of the 29th, the surveillance personnel have not left, so the personnel of the Democratic League will continue to make efforts on the 30th. A reporter also asked Luo Longji what their plans were after the dissolution of the Democratic League. Luo said that whether they can still be regarded as free people in the future will be decided by the government. Regarding the inside information about the Democratic League announced by the Ministry of Interior on the 29th, Luo believes that since there is some factual evidence, the government can submit it to the court for litigation.</p>
<p>Vice Minister's Opinion</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] After the government announced that the Democratic League was an illegal organization, a reporter interviewed Vice Minister Tao Xisheng of the Central Propaganda Department for his opinion. Tao stated: We expect Zhang Lan's "order" to stop the illegal activities of the Democratic League to be effective, and we also expect Luo Longji to formally declare his obedience to the government's orders. But if we expect them to extricate themselves, we will ultimately be disappointed. The unforgivable point of Luo Longji, Zhang Lan, etc. is that they are destroying Chinese political morality. We hope that the responsible security authorities will not allow them to escape the country, which can still protect them and prevent them from finishing the last stroke of Zheng Xiaoxu and Zhao Xinbo's deeds.</p>
<p>Our Country's Current Active Warships Number Four Hundred and Forty-Nine</p>

<p>Kuomintang Will Not Support Cross-Party Candidates Competing for National Assembly Seats; Secretary-General of the Municipal Assembly Does Not Need to Resign to Compete for Supervisory Committee</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party firmly refused to amend their lists of National Assembly candidates, each accounting for two-fifths of the "cross-party" candidates. The Kuomintang seems to have conceded to this, but declared that it will not support these candidates in the election. It is reported that the Youth Party has already replied to the Kuomintang, stating that it is unwilling to amend the list, and the Democratic Socialist Party emphasized that the so-called cross-party candidate issue does not exist. According to people familiar with the inner workings of the various political parties, there are indeed many Kuomintang members on the lists nominated by the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party. Most of the Kuomintang members who were widely recruited by these two parties on the eve of this general election are disillusioned members of the Kuomintang, so in terms of Kuomintang party discipline, these members must be punished.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] According to the Ministry of Interior, as ordered by the Executive Yuan, the Secretary-General of the Provincial or Municipal Assembly or Provisional Assembly does not need to resign from the position of Secretary-General because his duties are different from those of the Assembly members, and he can participate in the election for the Supervisory Committee.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] The Kuomintang councilors held another symposium on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss election issues. The final decision was to submit the lists of more than 30 Kuomintang councilors who will participate in the election to President Chiang by Mo Dehui and Shao Lizi for reference.</p>
<p>No Polling Place in Yantai; Remedial Measures Will Be Ordered</p>

The government is planning remedial measures. The government will announce separate measures for areas occupied and harassed by Communist bandits to handle election matters.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Jinan, 29th] The Shandong Provincial Free Professionals' Organizations held a joint meeting on the 29th, stating that it is unfair to divide Shandong into the Eastern District and handle the election together with the recovered provinces and cities due to the quota allocated by election districts. It was decided to telegraph the government to request a change to the Northern District and to reserve the voting rights of members in the unrecovered counties and cities. The Shandong National Assembly Friendship Association also sent a telegram expressing the same view.</p>
<p>French Tahiti Cancels Asian Tax; Satisfactory Results of Our Negotiations</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] Diplomatic sources; Regarding the issue of French Tahiti levying taxes on Asians, after our Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the embassy in France and the consulate in the local area to make repeated representations to the French side, satisfactory results have been obtained. The Tahitian local council recently passed a resolution to abolish the tax. (Note: Tahiti, also translated as Daxidi or Dahede, is located in the South Pacific, approximately 150 degrees east longitude and 18 degrees north latitude, and belongs to the French Society Islands. It is where the famous French painter Van Gogh lived and painted, and became famous. There are quite a few overseas Chinese. Our consul is Mr. Li Wenxian.)</p>

The content is as follows: (Continued on page 2, column 2)</p>
<h3>National Army in Eastern Hubei Recaptures Huangmei; Brilliant Victories on the Foothills of Dabie Mountains; Local Forces in Eastern Henan Recapture Chenliu County</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanchang, 29th] After Gui Yongqing inspected Jiujiang and strengthened patrols by Yangtze River warships, the defenses have become more consolidated. The Communist bandits entrenched in Huangmei were attacked by the National Army's powerful units, and the bandit army was routed and fled. The county seat has been recaptured, and the county's local troops have entered the city to clear the battlefield. The bandits from Guangji are also fleeing towards the northwest, leaving a small number of bandit troops entrenched in the suburbs, which are currently surrounded and attacked by the National Army. There are rumors that Guangji has been recovered, but officials have not confirmed it. In addition, Gui Yongqing will go to Hukou, Pengze, Madang, and other places within days to inspect the river defenses.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper's special dispatch from Nanjing, 29th] The National Army in eastern Hubei recaptured Qishui again at dawn on the 29th. In addition, the remaining bandits in the northeastern foothills of the Dabie Mountains are nearing their end. Since the National Army launched a crackdown on Liu's 3rd Column, which had fled into the mountainous areas, from Lu'an and Shucheng in the northeast of the Dabie Mountains, they have achieved brilliant victories. On the 25th and 26th, they captured Huoshan, Maochang, Zhongmeihe, and other important strongholds on the eastern foothills of the Dabie Mountains. The bandits fled into the deep mountains in a panic, and the National Army in pursuit were the same soldiers who had held the Dabie Mountains for more than eight years during the War of Resistance Against Japan. On the 27th and 28th, a unit of the National Army annihilated more than 300 bandits and seized many of their military supplies in the Dahua Ping area southwest of Huoshan (this place was the second guerrilla base in the Dabie Mountains during the war). Another unit killed Li Yuntang, the commander of the 23rd Regiment of the 9th Brigade of Liu's 3rd Column, as well as political commissar Chen Huaitang and more than 200 others in the Xiejiatan area of Tianjianshan south of Huoshan, seizing a two-way radio and more than 100 rifles and machine guns. The more than 400 people captured in the Dongnuerjie area of Zhaishan on the 26th have been sent to Hefei from the front and are being treated with great courtesy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] The local forces recaptured Chenliu County at 5:00 PM on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Re-emergence of Fierce Battles in the Jilin-Changchun Area; Bandits Attempt to Invade Changchun Airport, Driven Back; National Army in Northern Liaoning Recovers Changtu Railway Station</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Changchun, 29th of This Month] Fighting broke out near Dafangshen Airport this morning, but the bandits were driven away by the National Army, retreating towards the Tangjiayingzi area in the northwest. The National Army is pursuing them. Gunfire was heard briefly in Changchun City last night, but the city was extremely peaceful during the day. The bandits' attack was intended to draw the National Army eastward towards Jilin and to halt the air transport of reinforcements. 10,000 bandits have been discovered entrenched in the northwest of Changchun, and may attempt to sneak into the suburbs again at night. It has been determined that the units are the "West Manchurian Independent 4th Division" and the remnants of the 2nd Column.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] After the recent bandit disturbances in the Jilin-Changchun area, Changchun City heard the rumble of cannons and the crackle of gunfire for the first time last night. It was midnight, the moon was bright, and the stars were few. The outside temperature was four degrees Celsius below zero, and some people were awakened from their sleep. It is reported that several hundred bandits sneaked from Xiaolong towards Tangjiayingzi in the northern suburbs of Changchun, Zongjiawopu, and near the ten aircraft of Kuancheng at night. This group was a force that had been sent out by the National Army and was retreating. They were met by the National Army, and the bandits had fled far away by dawn. The area is the location of the 6th Precinct of the Changchun Police Bureau, and some officers were injured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] The bandits who were defeated and wounded from the northwest suburbs of Changchun before dawn on the 29th are still wandering in the villages and towns north of Dafangshen and Kuancheng's two airports. Elite troops of the National Army stationed in Changchun are now launching a fan-shaped encirclement to wipe them out. Furthermore, according to military sources, crack troops of the National Army have been arriving in Changchun continuously by air in recent days, and the war in the Jilin-Changchun area is about to enter a new phase. Although the main force of the bandits' Independent 4th Division once fiercely attacked the north and west airports of Changchun, attempting to prevent the National Army from advancing north, the National Army's strength is formidable, and the invading bandits will undoubtedly be crushed.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Shenyang, 29th of This Month] Artillery fire is raging in Jilin, and fierce offensive and defensive battles are unfolding. The main forces of the bandits' 2nd, 6th, and 10th Columns, as well as part of the 1st Column, and the Independent 12th Division, nearly 110,000 men in total, are besieging Jilin. The National Army is relying on solid fortifications to hold firm, and the air force is also constantly flying over to strafe them. From the night of the 28th, the bandits' 6th Column launched a fierce attack on Xiaobaishan, Jilin, with 4,000 men, while the 2nd Column attacked Weizishan with 3,000 men. At noon on the 29th, the National Army, with combined air, infantry, and artillery forces, repelled the bandits. On the night of the 29th, there was artillery fire near the outskirts of Jilin, and the defending troops have great confidence. The bandits are desperately trying to seize Jilin to open up the north-south railway transportation line. If they succeed, Dalian, North Korea, southern Liaoning, northern Songjiang, and even another national border could be connected. Therefore, they are attempting to capture it at all costs. The National Army is also determined to defend it firmly. This battle will be the decisive one in the bandits' sixth offensive.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] The situation in northern Liaoning is about to become clear. The National Army recovered Changtu Railway Station at noon on the 28th and is now advancing towards Tieling County.</p>

<h3>Editorial: A Proposal for Implementing Full Rationing Using Relief Food</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Relief Agreement stipulates that China will be assisted with certain basic necessities of life, the first of which is food. Although the detailed figures have not yet been officially announced, it is expected that the amount will be considerable.</p>
<p>We associate the question of how to distribute these relief supplies with the issue of food rationing. Taking this city as an example: from price ceilings and negotiated prices to free trade, the problem of people's food has never been completely resolved; from free trade and sales at parity to partial rationing, the problem of people's food has never been completely resolved. Everyone knows that to completely solve this problem, it is necessary to start with full rationing, and to achieve full rationing, it is necessary to have sufficient supplies. However, the municipal government does not have these supplies at all, so there is no question of rationing. In the past and present, the food that the municipal authorities have relied on is only that allocated by the Ministry of Food, so they have had to sell it temporarily and ration it partially, according to their means.</p>
<p>According to Article 2(a) of the Agreement, "All American relief supplies shall be...distributed by the Chinese Government and by voluntary agencies already established in China and agreed upon by the two Governments." This article stipulates the distribution agencies. If this food is handed over to the municipal government or the already established Civil Food Allocation Committee for distribution, there will naturally be no problem.</p>
<p>The same article also states that "In the larger Chinese cities where circumstances permit, distribution and price control systems shall be inaugurated with a view to ensuring that all classes of the people, irrespective of their purchasing power, shall obtain an equitable share of relief supplies imported from abroad or produced locally. It is understood that American relief supplies obtained under this Agreement may be used to support Chinese efforts to improve fees and control prices." This is tantamount to stipulating that large cities such as Shanghai should implement a full rationing system; in addition to the domestic and imported foreign rice and flour, the relief supplies can also be used as support.</p>
<p>Article 4(a) stipulates that "The Chinese Government will exert every possible effort to secure the maximum production and collection of locally produced supplies required for relief." This means that our country should strive to increase production and purchase and store as much as possible in order to make overall plans for rationing. Subparagraph (b) also stipulates that "The Chinese Government undertakes that no measures shall be adopted which would reduce the local supply of any article of the nature herein described by reason of the delivery, sale, or granting of such article and thereby increase the burden of relief." This means that after using relief supplies and implementing overall rationing, the original supplies of local goods can only be increased, not reduced.</p>
<p>Article 3(d): "Chinese currency expenditures incurred by reason of relief supplies, including the work of the resident American Relief Mission, and certain emergency relief programs currently being carried out by Chinese Government agencies and voluntary agencies, shall be used to sell and pre-pay funds upon request of the American representative from the proceeds of the sale of American relief supplies." In this view, even the expenses required by the agencies handling the distribution of relief supplies, whether they are American, Chinese, or so-called voluntary agencies, may be paid from the proceeds of the sale of relief supplies, but the Chinese government will advance them first when necessary. Although Article 3(e) states that the Chinese government is responsible for "local expenses for the handling, inland transport, and distribution of relief supplies, including unloading and other port expenses," it is normally not allowed to pay for it with the above-mentioned price. "But the American representative is willing to consider using this fund with the Chinese government to meet extraordinary expenses, so as not to impose an excessive burden on the Chinese government." All the expenses of handling the rationing may be paid by the sales price.</p>
<p>There is no explicit provision in the agreement on how much food our country should bear when implementing full rationing. Assuming that each party bears half, and with the current population of the city being approximately 4.5 million, of which small households account for approximately one-quarter, calculating based on two *dou* for large households and one *dou* for small households, the city requires a total of 788,000 *shi* of rice per month. Then our country's rice rationing can proceed smoothly, without any major obstacles. If the U.S. side agrees, they can be allocated according to the current *shi* of rice, and the rest can be allocated from the relief food. Then, after these grains arrive, the so-called full rationing can be implemented immediately. The city's food problem can be completely resolved, and the fluctuations in rice prices will not affect general prices.</p>
<p>Article 1(d) of the Agreement states that "The Chinese Government shall, at any time in advance, present to the American Government its proposed plans for the number of import needs for economic relief: these plans shall be subject to review and approval by the American Government." The city's full rationing is in line with the provisions of the agreement and is appropriate for the needs of Lei Jing. It seems to be part of the government's plan and can serve as a reference for implementation in other major cities. The handling of these relief supplies can be completed entirely in 1946, and we hope to formulate plans as soon as possible and implement them on a scheduled basis to solve this serious problem.</p>
<p>Australian Minister Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] Australia opposes retaining the veto power in the peace conference with Japan. Australia's opposition to the principle of the veto power has been consistent for a long time, and the records of the United Nations conferences are sufficient to prove it. Australia hopes that the peace conference with Japan can be convened as soon as possible, but this is unrelated to the opposition to the veto power. Furthermore, the various members of the British Empire do not intend to vote as a group in the peace conference with Japan. The various members of the British Empire will never appear as a group unless a common crisis arises. Australia believes that the decision on Japan's future industrial level should be based on two principles: one is not to give Japan the opportunity to re-invade, and the other is to maintain the hope of Japan's economic development. Regarding China's revitalization, Australia welcomes any news about China's internal revitalization, because China's revitalization is related to the peace and stability of the Far East. Australia does not want anyone to use Japan to become a force for stabilizing the Far East, because this move will make Japan the strongest country in Asia again and threaten the Allies again. The volume of trade between Australia and China in 1939 accounted for only 6% of China's total imports; to expand Sino-Australian trade, the key lies in China's internal revitalization. China must restore its export industry before it has foreign exchange to purchase goods from other countries. Regarding the future exercise of international supervision over Japan, Minister Gao advocates that each country should send representatives to Japan and demand that Japan implement political and economic reforms. As for the period of implementation of supervision, it is inevitable to become a pedantic view at this time, because the international situation changes at any time, and everything should be based on the actual situation. As for the issue of Japan's compensation, the total amount of compensation is still unknown at this time. This is a long-term task that should be carried out under the strict supervision of the Allies, and its distribution will benefit the entire region. It is worth noting that the amount of compensation for each war in history has been less than expected. Minister Gao finally pointed out that due to the evolution of the situation, Australia's responsibility in Southeast Asia and the Pacific has become heavier than in the past. Today, Australia has also implemented a rationing system, saving money on food and clothing, and donating 25 million pounds to help alleviate the British economic crisis. Regarding the newly emerging national forces in Southeast Asia after the war, Foreign Minister Evatt has declared that he is willing to "treat them with a realistic understanding attitude," but hopes that they will become a huge cooperative force to improve the living standards of people in the entire region.</p>
<p>Situation of Opening Trade with Japan</p>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) The reason for opening trade this time is to cope with American merchants and to encourage the import of raw materials. However, only foreign merchants are allowed to come to Japan, and Japanese merchants are not allowed to go abroad to promote sales. Therefore, Japan is actually in a passive position and cannot operate in the markets of other countries. Due to Japan's lack of raw materials and funds, its production capacity has been reduced, and it cannot export a large number of goods. Not to mention dumping, it is even more impossible to compete with other countries under the strict control of the Allied Headquarters. Except for seafood, bamboo, lacquerware, and consumables that can be purchased in cash, all machines and important hardware materials must be exchanged for imported raw materials. Surveying the current situation, it is difficult to expect Japan's exports to develop within a year, and Sino-Japanese trade is even less optimistic. According to records, our country owed Japan approximately 1.5 million US dollars last year. The amount has not been settled this year, and the amount is likely to be even greater, making procurement difficult. Although we have repeatedly argued that our country has suffered heavy losses due to the Anti-Japanese War and lacks materials, trade is different from compensation. If the outstanding accounts are not cleared, it is difficult to over-argue. If we do not change our strategy and actively increase our country's exports, all trade may be suspended. Furthermore, examining the progress of trade in other countries, the United States has provided a loan of 100 million US dollars to supply cotton in exchange for yarn and cloth. Since the end of the war, Australia has imported 7,000 bales of wool, and recently sent many experts to Japan to discuss the exchange of wool and the expansion of import quantities. Representatives from India also came here with the main task of exchanging cotton for machinery. The remaining British, Canadian, Philippine, and Dutch countries all have considerable activities. The close relationship between China and Japan should not be ignored. Opening trade aims to encourage commercial operations. Our country can award and encourage merchants to export. For imported materials, in addition to those directly purchased and stored by the government, it seems appropriate for exporters to undertake them with priority within the scope of control. It is said that the profits from imported materials are higher. The huge profits obtained from imports are used to compensate for exports. In addition, with strict foreign exchange control, the amount of exports can be easily increased.</p>
<h3>Xu Baiyuan's Speech: Four-Bank Joint Loan Policy</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 29th of This Month] Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Four-Bank Joint Treasury, gave a speech at the invitation of the Cooperative Bank at 2:00 PM on the 29th regarding the Four-Bank Joint Loan. He pointed out that the loan mainly focuses on assistance to undertakings related to the national economy or people's livelihood, and which are helpful to exports and cultural relief. As for the loan policy, it mainly consists of: handling loans in accordance with the policy of tightening credit and verifying needs; cooperating with the government's economic policies to help the government stabilize prices; grasping the results of loans, or grasping the physical objects; adopting a low-interest policy for necessary production undertakings. Xu then explained his hopes for the Cooperative Bank's business. After Xu finished his speech, Deputy General Manager Wang of the bank, Manager Hong of the Henan Branch, and Manager Xu of the Shanxi Branch raised various questions and explained the general situation of promoting various businesses locally. Xu expressed great concern and agreed to invite the persons in charge to hold a symposium at a later date so that they could exchange opinions in detail again. Furthermore, the Central Cooperative Bank's Treasury Conference still held a review meeting on the morning of the 29th. At 7:00 PM, the Central Cooperative Undertaking Steering Committee and other agencies invited all the representatives to a banquet. Gu Zhenggang and Chen Lifu delivered speeches on the spot.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Peiping, 29th of This Month] The College of Engineering of Peking University, which was recently taken over three months ago, held its 44th anniversary today. The college specially invited alumni who graduated since the 27th year of Guangxu to return to the school to connect with each other. Many alumni of the Pingda College of Engineering who previously opposed the takeover returned to the school and were warmly received. The mood was quite good. The alumni unanimously hoped that Peking University could carry it forward. President Ma Dayou specially invited Hu Shi, Chairman of the Alumni Association, to give a speech. He first said, "I sincerely welcome all alumni home," and then emphasized the elimination of sectarianism, saying, "Everyone is a student of China." He exclaimed that the school is not "yours" or "ours," but "ours," and hoped that "we can establish a good school."

<h3>The Truth About the Illegal Activities of the China Democratic League</h3>
<p>— (Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>When the National Army recovered Changchun and the CCP's power in the Northeast collapsed, it urgently sought a delaying tactic. Therefore, the CCP delegation sent Qi Yanming and Wang Bingnan to Shanghai on May 28, 1946, to meet with Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, and Shen Junru of the China Democratic League to discuss with Zhou Enlai, Gai Biwu, Lu Dingyi, and Qi Yanming of the CCP. At that time, the CCP's conspiracy was to demand that the government stop military actions in the Northeast on one hand, and to insist on reorganizing the Northeast Political Committee and governments at all levels, with the participation of various parties, on the other hand. The China Democratic League stepped forward to work on this. On August 29th, the China Democratic League, following the CCP's instructions, sent representatives to meet with Marshall to propose a comprehensive ceasefire and the reorganization of the Northeast political institutions. Afterwards, the China Democratic League, together with the CCP, planned with Ma Xulun and Yan Baohang in Shanghai to launch their so-called anti-civil war movement to serve the CCP's purpose of buying time. This activity of the China Democratic League was unsuccessful, but its members entered the Northeast one after another to serve the CCP's puppet organizations.</p>
<p>The Issue of Reorganizing the Government: Expanding the government organization was to be implemented before the convening of the National Assembly according to the Five-Point Agreement of the Political Consultative Conference. Article 6 of this agreement stipulated that proposals discussed by the National Government Committee that involved changes to the policy guidelines must be approved by two-thirds of the members present to be passed. The CCP and the China Democratic League demanded that they must occupy 14 of the 40 seats on the Government Committee, which exceeded one-third, in order to maintain their so-called veto power. This request was opposed by other parties, causing disputes and delaying the reorganization of the government. This is enough to demonstrate the China Democratic League's close following of the CCP, and the CCP's trust in the China Democratic League to be its tool in political struggles.</p>
<p>The Issue of the National Assembly: Convening the National Assembly was one of the Five-Point Agreement of the Political Consultative Conference, originally scheduled to be implemented on May 5, 1946. When the meeting date was approaching, the CCP and the China Democratic League refused to submit the two lists of names for participation in the National Government and the National Assembly, so the government had no choice but to announce the postponement of the National Assembly. In June of the same year, the government set the date for the National Assembly to be convened on November 12, but the China Democratic League still followed the CCP in refusing to submit its list of representatives to participate in the National Assembly. On October 28, Mo Dehui and other social figures came forward to mediate, with third-party figures signing to attend the National Assembly as a condition for postponing the National Assembly for three days, so that the government and the CCP could reach an agreement on the reorganization of the government and military issues within these three days. Luo Longji and others of the China Democratic League also signed, but Zhou Enlai severely criticized Liang Shuming and others of the China Democratic League, and they realized that this decision violated the CCP's intentions and canceled their signatures. This was the last manifestation of the China Democratic League following the CCP in peace negotiations. The details can be seen in Zhang Junmai's explanation published in the newspapers on October 14, 1947.</p>
<p>The Issue of Peace Talks: The Agreement on the Cessation of Conflicts and Restoration of Communications in January 1946 and the Plan for the Reorganization of the National Army and the Unified Integration of the Communist Army into the National Army in February were the basis for peace negotiations, and the representatives of the China Democratic League also participated in the signing of the agreement on military issues of the Political Consultative Conference. However, throughout 1946, peace negotiations were delayed and ultimately failed due to the CCP's insistence on military separatism and intensified military rebellion. During this year, the China Democratic League echoed the ceasefire when the CCP proposed a ceasefire, such as the negotiations after May, and also opposed the ceasefire when the CCP opposed the ceasefire, such as the negotiations on the eve of the National Assembly. In its propaganda, the China Democratic League repeatedly blamed the government for the delay in peace talks in its speeches and documents. Its political report at the Second Plenary Session completely spoke on behalf of the Communist bandits, accusing the government of being responsible for the failure of the peace talks.</p>
<p>After the National Assembly closed, the CCP was determined to carry out military rebellion to the end, insisting on unreasonable conditions and opposing the resumption of peace talks. The China Democratic League also followed its instructions, launching propaganda against the peace movement initiated by Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunchu, and other figures from the Shanghai business community. The China Democratic League believed that only resistance to conscription and grain taxes in the countryside and resistance to donations and taxes in the cities were true peace movements. Luo Longji openly stated that the China Democratic League would not participate in peace talks that did not aim at genuine peace. From then on, the China Democratic League abandoned the peace movement and devoted itself to underground work of resisting conscription, resisting grain taxes, resisting taxes, resisting donations, and inciting student and worker movements.</p>
<p>The Anti-American Movement: The CCP started the anti-American movement in July 1946, and the China Democratic League also followed the instructions and echoed consistently. In September, the CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee designated it as the "Anti-American Propaganda Shock Month." First, Chen Jiakang, Qiao Mu, Fan Changjiang, and others were sent by Zhou Enlai of the CCP to contact Luo Longji, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Liu Wangliming, and others of the China Democratic League. The CCP funded the China Democratic League to enable it to orchestrate the so-called "Ten Major People's Organizations" and establish the "World Peace Promotion Association" to hold the "US Troops Withdraw from China Propaganda Week" from September 23 to September 29.</p>
<p>On September 27, Deng Chumin and others of the China Democratic League in Chongqing, Zhang Dongsun and Zhang Shenfu of the China Democratic League in Beiping, and Hu Yuzhi and Hu Shouyu of the China Democratic League in Singapore held anti-American symposiums or representative meetings simultaneously. Other places such as Hong Kong and Kunming also launched actions one after another. The CCP launched a response from its Communist bandit-occupied areas inside and outside the customs starting on October 7. In mid-to-late November, the China Democratic League cooperated with the CCP again to launch propaganda against the Sino-US Commercial Treaty in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Beiping. To this day, this propaganda continues to intensify.</p>
<p>The Issue of International Interference: Before the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in March 1947, the China Democratic League, accepting the CCP's instructions, launched a movement to demand international joint interference in China's internal affairs to increase the CCP's momentum. The Shanghai Wenhui Daily and its associated newspapers spared no effort in advocating international interference, which was obvious to all. Zhang Lan and other responsible persons of the China Democratic League, together with personnel from the China Association for Promoting Democracy and the China National Democratic Construction Association, jointly telegraphed the British, Soviet, and American foreign ministers' meeting, attacking the United States and requesting the three countries to jointly discuss the China issue. The professional students guided by the China Democratic League also launched the same movement in some universities in Beijing and Shanghai, demanding international interference in China.</p>
<p>(B) The China Democratic League Undertakes Bandit Area Work</p>
<p>The Fact</p>
<p>While the China Democratic League undermined the agreements of the Political Consultative Conference, refused to participate in the National Assembly and the National Government, and expelled the Chinese Social Democratic Party for participating in the National Assembly and the National Government, on the other hand, it systematically participated in the CCP's illegal regime. After the CCP's Northeast Bureau convened the "Northeast Provincial and Municipal Representative Conference" in Harbin from August 7 to August 15, 1946, and established the puppet "Joint Administrative Office of Northeast Provinces and Cities," personnel of the China Democratic League rushed to the Northeast bandit area to hold important puppet positions. The facts are listed on the left:</p>
<p>The Communist bandits absorb League members to go to the bandit area: In September 1946, Zhou Enlai in Shanghai discussed with Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others of the China Democratic League to register unemployed personnel of the China Democratic League to go to the bandit area to work. The original letter from the CCP delegation to the headquarters of the China Democratic League is recorded below:</p>
<p>Entrusted by Mr. Zhou Enlai, a record of talks with your League is enclosed. There are more than 300 unemployed members of your League in the Beijing-Shanghai area, many of whom are serving in cultural, educational, industrial, and commercial circles with high capabilities. Our delegation will first register them for job placement. Our delegation has assigned Comrade Hua Qiang as the person in charge of registration in Nanjing, located at the Xinhua Daily Office at 360 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing. Please notify the unemployed members of your League that those who are going to work in the liberated area should bring a letter of certification from your League and go to the above location to register, starting from September 26, 1946.

<h3>Vigorously Seeking to Resolve the Stalemate in the Korean Issue; Britain Supports the US Proposal; the Soviet Union Still Insists that the US and Soviet Union Should Withdraw Their Troops First, and Advocates Inviting Korean Representatives to Participate in the UN General Assembly Discussion</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 28th] Britain fully endorsed the US proposal to establish a United Nations commission to supervise elections in Korea and the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from the country. Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative and also the president of the Security Council, told the UN Political Committee that it was crucial to have a neutral body to oversee the Korean elections. Cadogan opposed the Soviet proposal to have the two countries withdraw their troops and allow the Korean people to establish their own government without foreign assistance. He said that this might cause greater chaos and that the British government was unwilling to take responsibility for this. Cadogan also opposed the Soviet proposal to have Korea send appropriate representatives to the United Nations to participate in the discussion of their national affairs. He said that this would cause serious and insurmountable difficulties because these representatives could not arrive in Lake Success in time for this session of the United Nations General Assembly. He believed that at the current stage, there could be no genuine Korean representatives here, and furthermore, he did not think it was necessary. The US proposal did not seek to impose any particular regime on the Korean people. After Cadogan's speech, the Polish representative, Mr. Bobke, rose to speak and expressed his support for the Soviet proposal made by the Soviet representative, Gromyko, on the 28th. Gromyko reiterated that US and Soviet troops should withdraw first, and that Korean representatives should be brought to Lake Success for discussion before the US proposal is put to a vote. However, the Australian representative, Evatt, pointed out that the Soviet proposal was not submitted in writing. The Chairman of the Political Committee, Mr. Rosenbert, representing Mr. Bische, agreed to this point and immediately adjourned the meeting until 11 a.m. on the 29th. Prior to this, Evatt strongly argued that Australia and several other countries had participated in the Pacific War longer than the Soviet Union, so the relevant countries in the Pacific should not be excluded from the consultations on Korean issues in Moscow and other places.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 29th] A spokesman for the US delegation stated today that the United States opposes the Soviet Union's request for the United Nations General Assembly to invite representatives of the Korean people to participate in the debate on Korean independence and to order US and Soviet troops to withdraw from Korea before January 1 next year. The Soviet proposal is unnecessary and appears to be delaying or even stopping the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the case. (See the draft of Gu Weijun's speech on the first page)</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Korean Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] Behind the Korean issue lies a complex and difficult political situation similar to that in the Balkans. Although the US and the Soviet Union mutually accused each other of lacking faith in the negotiations on Korean independence in the first round, neither side mentioned the political reality that exists behind the current stalemate. The main obstacle to Korean unification is the disagreement on the form of the interim government. The Soviet Union insists that Koreans who opposed trusteeship in the past should not participate, which in effect means that no one except the Communist Party should participate, while the United States insists that all political parties should participate.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of the interim government, the Soviet Union insists that Koreans should form their own government without external interference because it believes that the Communist Party in North Korea is more tightly organized and stronger than the non-Communist parties in South Korea. Therefore, if elections are not held under US supervision, the Korean Communists can monopolize all important positions through their propaganda. The US authorities, in order to cope with the political weaknesses in its occupied area, insist that the Korean parliament should be elected according to a proportional representation system, so that the southern region, which accounts for two-thirds of the total Korean population, can obtain a two-thirds majority.</p>
<h3>US Security Advisory Council Strictly Prevents Leaks of Secrets</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] The Security Advisory Council of the US State Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff is currently organizing a mechanism to handle the issue of classified intelligence, aiming to prevent leaks of intelligence that endanger US security and put the US in a desperate situation.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on Undersecretary Lovett's statement that the Top Secret report of Wedemeyer has caused great damage to US security.</p>
<h3>Danish Elections Announced; Communist Party Suffers a Setback but Shows Slight Recovery</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Copenhagen, Denmark, 29th] It was learned today that the final vote count of the parliamentary elections showed that the Communist Party lost nine of its original eighteen seats in the Lower House, occupying only nine seats. The right-leaning Farmers' Party received the most votes, winning 49 seats, eleven more than in the last election. Most observers believe that the reason for the Communist Party's failure is its recent demand for the purge of Congress and its activities in various European countries.</p>
<h3>US Journalist Comes to China for a Visit</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 28th] Robert McCormick, publisher and chief editor of the authoritative "Chicago Tribune" in the western United States, flew to the Far East today with his wife for an inspection tour. McCormick said that the purpose of this trip was to gather news, and he plans to visit Japan, Korea, China, and Egypt.</p>
<h3>Bullitt Criticizes the Soviet Union; Points Out that the Soviet Union Intends to Conquer China; Emphasizes that Stalin Should Be Forced to Back Down</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 29th] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union William Bullitt criticized the Soviet Union for wanting to rule the world with communism and to strengthen itself in order to "attack the United States." Bullitt said: "The Soviet Union's goals have never changed. Unless the people of the Soviet Union can control their government, these goals will never change. Stalin will never know when to stop. We can only force Stalin to back down. At present, the Soviet Union does not dare to discuss launching a war against the United States. The Soviet Union is currently strengthening its national power in order to attack the United States in the end. At present, the Soviet Union is consolidating its control over 120 million Europeans and wants to seize France, Italy, Greece, and conquer China."</p>
<h3>Communist Rebellion in Bolivia Suppressed</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 28th] It is reported that the Communist revolutionary movement in the Bolivian region of Bakri has been suppressed by the Bolivian government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 28th] The Brazilian Army Ministry, in view of the fact that the Communist Party in neighboring Bolivia has attacked and occupied the border town of Guaramirim, has ordered the Brazilian Army to take every measure to ensure Brazil's neutrality.</p>
<h3>US Congressional Special Session is Approaching; Marshall Returns to Washington; Truman Begins Drafting Legislation</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 29th] US Secretary of State Marshall returned to Washington on the 29th to prepare for the congressional special session on aid to Europe. He may come here at any time to discuss major issues at future UN General Assembly meetings, but the routine work in the UN General Assembly has been handed over to US Chief Representative Austin.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] President Truman began today to draft his message to the special session of Congress, which will recommend legislation to implement the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. President's Press Secretary Ross announced this and said that the President has received some recommendations decided by the Harriman-led Foreign Aid Advisory Committee. Authoritative sources revealed that the main contents of the plan have been tentatively set as: Congress approves an appropriation of 7 billion yuan as the aid amount for the first year of the four-year European Economic Recovery Plan, with a total of approximately 20 billion yuan needed in four years, with the annual needs decreasing in turn. The governments of the European countries participating in the Marshall Plan form a multilateral agreement, accept the principles of the plan proposed by the United States, and the United States and each European country government conclude bilateral agreements. This indicates that European countries should also do their best, like the United States, to help the implementation of the Marshall Plan. Each participating European country is responsible for including the proceeds from the sale of goods obtained from the United States in its budget. For example, if the United States supplies wheat to France under the Marshall Plan, France does not have to pay for the wheat, but it will include the number of francs equal to the US dollar value of the wheat it receives in its budget revenue item. This franc will be used to increase France's contribution to the implementation of the Marshall Plan. This measure can reduce the amount of US dollars required for the old Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Taft Criticizes the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Boston, 28th] Senator Robert Taft said on the 28th that the Marshall Plan in its current form is "completely unreasonable." Taft, a Republican nominee for president, is probably the most powerful leader of the Republican Party in Congress. His criticism of the government's aid to Europe plan almost certainly indicates that he will lead the struggle in the special congressional session on November 17. He said that the reason why the United States has inflation is because it is helping foreign countries too much. He criticized the shipment of coal and steel to Europe, saying that Europe has abundant coal reserves, while steel is also in short supply in the United States.</p>
<h3>US Small Plane Completes Round-the-World Flight</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Shemya, Alaska, 28th] A small monoplane piloted by Truman and Evans landed here at 1:35 Greenwich Mean Time. They departed from Nemuro, Hokkaido, Japan, and crossed the harsh North Pacific Ocean, flying 1,500 miles in 13 hours and 35 minutes. They left the United States on August 9 for a round-the-world flight, and landed on US soil on October 28. The place where they landed tonight is at the western end of the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<h3>European Countries Launch Organization of Customs Union; the Soviet Union is Invited to Participate in Discussions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 28th] The governments of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have invited the governments of all European countries, excluding Spain and Germany, including the Soviet Union, to meet in Brussels on November 10 to discuss the possibility of organizing a European customs union.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Financial experts from Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, and Italy, who participated in the meeting of the Payment Agreement Committee established at the Marshall Plan meeting last month, have decided to recommend to their respective governments that they sign an agreement stipulating monetary cooperation on a multilateral basis. Relevant parties said that although a complete agreement has been reached on the principle of exchange, other countries still believe that the proposal of the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and Italy to establish a central exchange office is premature.</p>
<h3>US Will Launch a Broad Propaganda Offensive to Counter the New Comintern; US Military Government in Germany Will Purge Left-Leaning Elements</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 28th] US Military Governor in Germany, General Clay, told a press conference on the 28th that he might retire from the military next year. He has requested the Army Department to allow him to retire in 1948 so that he can get rid of military and public life and return to his hometown of Georgia for fishing. It is said that the United States plans to launch a propaganda offensive in Germany to "defend the doctrines we believe in and attack the doctrines we do not believe in." Officials said that the purpose of this new plan is to deal with the Communist Information Bureau. General Clay's statement is the intention of the United States to launch a propaganda offensive around the world, because the Soviet Union is spreading propaganda around the world trying to defeat the power of the United States. General Clay said that the United States' propaganda does not attack any foreign government, but is explaining US policy. The military government has ordered that no government official may attack a foreign government in public speeches, and at the same time, those in the US military government who deeply believe in communism will be dismissed.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Dispute Over Repatriation of Japanese POWs Resurfaces</h3>
<p>(United Press, Tokyo, 29th) The United States and the Soviet Union clashed again today at the Allied Council for Japan. The chairman of the council, U.S. representative Mr. Sebald, accused the Soviet Union of failing to fulfill its agreement to repatriate Japanese prisoners of war. Soviet representative Mr. Kislenko claimed that the U.S.'s inclusion of the POW repatriation issue on the agenda was merely an attempt to incite anti-Soviet sentiment among the Japanese. Mr. Kislenko also said that the treatment of repatriated Japanese prisoners was miserable, tantamount to leaving them to their own devices. The issue of repatriating prisoners was not within the scope of the council's discussions. Mr. Sebald replied that a matter affecting so many Japanese people should be discussed.</p>
<h3>Democratic Party of Japan: Horizontal and Vertical Alliances; Mr. Shigeru Yoshida Expected to Become Next Prime Minister</h3>
<p>(New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th) The Democratic Party is studying countermeasures regarding the conservative new party movement centered on the Liberal Party. Given the current cabinet's dire straits, the Democratic Party is concentrating its efforts with the aim of securing the next prime minister position. Ichimatsu and Kimura, both traditionally considered part of the Kijūrō Shidehara faction, have also expressed their strong support for Mr. Yoshida to assume the premiership in the next term. They have also temporarily agreed to unify within the party. However, regarding the Liberal Party, they have proposed forming a four-party coalition cabinet. If the Liberal Party objects, they appear poised to adopt divisive tactics toward the Liberal Party. Currently, the conservative new party movement and the four-party coalition cabinet movement centered on Mr. Yoshida seem to be intertwined. The People's Cooperative Party also shows a tendency to merge with the Democratic Party. As for the Socialist Party, there seems to be an understanding on the part of Mr. Nishio. However, if Mr. Nishio leans too close to the Democratic Party, Mr. Hirano may take opposing action.</p>
<h3>United Press Female Employee Suddenly Arrested in Budapest</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Budapest, 28th) Miss Elizabeth Berelos, an American secretary to Mr. Jack Quin, a correspondent for the United Press in Budapest, has been arrested by the Hungarian political police. The reason for the arrest has not been announced.</p>
<h3>French Communists Hold Large Demonstration to Obstruct Pro-de Gaulle Anti-Soviet Rally; Military Police Deployed, Leading to Fierce Clashes</h3>
<p>(United Press, Paris, 28th) Fifteen thousand members of the French Communist Party staged a demonstration march on the 28th, attempting to break through a pro-de Gaulle anti-Soviet rally, but were ultimately dispersed by police using batons and bayonets. This incident occurred just after Prime Minister Paul Ramadier requested a vote of confidence from parliament for his coalition government. Prime Minister Ramadier stated in parliament that civil war was almost inevitable if France were to be divided into two opposing camps, left and right. The vote will take place on the 30th (Thursday).</p>
<p>Many demonstrators were injured, and twelve gendarmes were also injured by stones. The clashes lasted for two hours. A large contingent of regular army troops, carrying submachine guns, arrived to maintain order, and the clashes finally ceased. The pro-de Gaulle rally was originally scheduled to take place at the Wagram Hall on Wagram Street in eastern Paris. Police drove the Communist crowd from Wagram Street to Place des Ternes, and then cavalry dispersed them from there. As police dispersed the demonstrators, the cries of women in the crowd along the street shook the heavens. The windows of all the shops at the scene had been smashed, and shoes, handbags, and other items dropped by the demonstrators were seen all along the street. Many demonstrators have been arrested. The pro-de Gaulle rally was eventually able to proceed, only delayed by thirty minutes due to the incident.</p>
<p>(United Press, Paris, 29th) The military police's dispersal of the Communist demonstrators has caused Paris to experience its most serious political incident since the liberation on the 29th. The leftist "L'Humanité" called the incident a "bloody attack," accusing Prime Minister Ramadier of being a "protector of anti-Soviet thugs." The newspaper also stated: "This is the result of a policy of selling out the interests of the French people, and the result of obeying the policies of the gold standard empire."</p>

At the same time, he suggested to the CCP that the central leadership should remain behind the scenes in the student movement, and delegate the executive power to the Democratic League, as there were many Democratic League members in the education sector. The CCP accepted this suggestion. (Note: The Pseudo-Yan'an University was an institution used by the Communist bandits to train cadres.)</p>

<p>(C) Facts about the Democratic League Participating in Communist Bandit Military Rebellion</p>
<p>The Process of Zhou Jingwen, Luo Binji, and Others Colluding with Communist Bandits to Establish a Pseudo-Regime.</p>
<p>Splitting China's Northeast Territory and Sovereignty has been a consistent conspiracy and ambition of the Communist bandits. The Democratic League has been their political and military assistant. Before the National Assembly in 1946, Zhou Jingwen, a Standing Committee Member of the Democratic League, met in Shanghai with Chen Jianzhong, the head of the "Northeast Youth Association," a representative of the remnants of the puppet Manchukuo, and decided to request the Communist bandits to demarcate an area in the Northeast, concentrate their forces, and jointly establish a pseudo-"Northeast Autonomous Government" with the Communist bandits, the Democratic League, and the "East Youth," etc. Chen Jianzhong was then introduced by Zhou Jingwen to meet with Dong Biwu, a representative of the Communist bandits. Dong agreed to introduce Chen and others to meet with Lin Biao and Li Lisan for discussions. According to Zhou Jingwen's statement to Chen, if they could gather troops, the Communist army could provide a region. If they could issue a ceasefire slogan and establish a pseudo-government before March 10, 1947, it might attract international attention.</p>
<p>In January 1947, Zhou Jingwen dispatched Luo Binji (listed as an Executive Committee Member of the Democratic League's Northeast Branch in the list submitted by the Democratic League to the government) to the Northeast with Chen Jianzhong to inspect the strength of Chen's troops and to connect with old and new connections in various places in Northeast and North China. Luo traveled out of the pass from the Beining Line via Shenyang to Changchun. The "Preparatory Committee of the Northeast People's Autonomous Committee," led by Zhou Jingwen of the Democratic League, the "Northeast Youth Association" led by Chen Jianzhong, and the "Northeast People's Patriotic Support Association," which Chen had won over, signed an "Agreement" in Changchun on March 8th to establish the pseudo-"Provisional Northeast People's Autonomous Committee" and the pseudo-"General Headquarters of the Northeast People's Autonomous Army." The pseudo-Central Committee of the pseudo-Autonomous Committee had one chairman, assumed by Zhou Jingwen of the Democratic League; and seventeen committee members, including four from the Democratic League, four from the Communist bandits, eight from five groups including the "Three Principles of the People Comrades Association," the "Northeast Cultural Association," the "Northeast Political Construction Association," the "Northeast Youth Association," and the "Northeast People's Patriotic Support Association," and one so-called "social notable."</p>
<p>After the establishment of the pseudo-Autonomous Committee, Luo and others secretly gathered forces and issued a "Letter to Northeast Armed Comrades," inciting the National Army to mutiny. They also issued a "Letter to Fellow Representatives" in the individual name of Zhou Jingwen, which had already been printed on January 17th, encouraging the people to betray the country. On March 11th, Luo Binji and a party of six set off for Harbin to meet with the Communist bandit Lin Biao, conspiring to discuss the demarcation of an area by the Communist bandits, concentrating the forces of Chen Jianzhong, and issuing a telegram during the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference to establish a pseudo-government. Luo and others were detained or searched by the National Army on the Changchun front, and many drafts and secret documents were seized. According to their confessions, they were ordered by Li Jishen and Zhou Jingwen to collude with the Communist bandits and engage in treasonous activities. (Continued on Page 5)</p>

<h3>Nanjing Promotes Frugality; Dance Ban Implemented in Stages; Short-Term Partial Ban First; Frugality Measures for Private Cars and Gasoline Resolutely Implemented</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th) The Executive Yuan's Frugality Supervision Committee has decided that the enforcement of the dance ban in Shanghai will first implement a portion of it in the short term. As for a complete ban, the method is still awaiting detailed proposals from Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, before discussion. The principle will be to implement it in stages, with a timeframe shorter than one year. The Frugality Supervision Committee held a meeting at 4 PM on the 29th, attended by Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, to report on the difficulties of implementing the dance ban in Shanghai and the demands of the dance industry. The meeting also discussed other frugality-related issues, such as restrictions on gasoline for private cars, and resolved to resolutely implement the originally promulgated frugality measures.</p>
<h3>Meeting on Gasoline Rationing for Vehicles</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The city's Committee on Gasoline Rationing for Vehicles held a meeting yesterday at the Public Utilities Bureau. It was resolved that cases involving discrepancies in gasoline usage for commercial trucks and small package cars would be submitted to Shen Naizheng, a counselor to the city government, Shi Bangfan, a representative of the City Council, Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhang Rentao, the Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, for joint review. If they deemed the need to be genuine, the Public Utilities Bureau would borrow gasoline from the oil companies on their behalf. Concrete measures will be formulated later. However, the committee unanimously agreed that the situation regarding industrial gasoline usage warranted attention. Because there are no precise statistics on industrial electricity usage in the city, oil companies should include vehicle gasoline usage when allocating gasoline to factories. In reality, however, factory vehicles still obtain gasoline purchase permits from the Public Utilities Bureau, resulting in duplicate allocations. Therefore, the committee believes that a thorough investigation is necessary. Representatives from the oil companies have expressed their willingness to cooperate and will submit detailed reports on industrial gasoline usage in the future to avoid duplication and compensate for shortages. As for the city's method of allocating gasoline based on vehicle type, it will be formulated after the review is complete.</p>
<h3>Fifteen City Councilors Propose Temporary Motion to Relax Restrictions on Private Cars; Public Utilities Bureau Decides to Establish Review Committee</h3>
<p>After the Executive Yuan issued an order restricting the use of gasoline for private vehicles, the City Public Utilities Bureau followed suit by issuing a public notice stating that, starting from October 14th of this year, registration and licensing for cars would be suspended for all private individuals or private legal entities, except those who met the requirements of the regulations and were approved to use a certain number of vehicles. City Councilors Wang Zhuyi, Wu Zhengji, Ma Junshuo, Tao Baichuan, Jiang Hao, Gao Shuan, Zhu Fuji, and fifteen others believe that, in addition to the private individuals and private legal entities stipulated in Article 3 of the regulations, there are also private hospitals, schools, various guilds, labor unions, charities, as well as councilors, lawyers, accountants, architects, and engineers, whose nature and business, or public needs, are not significantly different from those of doctors listed in Category 1 and banks, factories, mines, and newspapers listed in Section 2. Therefore, the scope of private individuals and private legal entities permitted to use cars should be slightly relaxed. Furthermore, the transfer of ownership of private cars is a common occurrence, and since there are no restrictions on such transfers in the regulations, they should continue to be permitted freely to avoid the loss caused by freezing vehicles. The councilors have jointly submitted a temporary motion to the City Council with the above opinions, which will be discussed at the fourth general meeting to be reconvened tomorrow.</p>
<p>Three Points of Supplementary Opinion</p>
<p>The three points of supplementary opinion that they propose to suggest to the central government are as follows:</p>
<p>In addition to the physicians stipulated in Article 3, Section 1 of the regulations, other lawyers, accountants, architects, and engineers who are legally registered, as well as public officials such as councilors, should be permitted to use cars due to business and public needs.</p>
<p>In addition to the banks, factories, mines, newly opened newspapers, and large-scale private enterprises related to daily necessities stipulated in Article 3, Section 10 of the regulations, other legally registered private hospitals, schools, and legal entities, such as various guilds, labor unions, and charitable organizations, should be granted some relaxation of restrictions and permitted to use cars.</p>
<p>All private cars should be permitted to be transferred to any private individual or private legal entity.</p>
<p>Responsible for Review and Research</p>
<p>After the City Public Utilities Bureau issued the regulations restricting the use of cars by private individuals, it attached great importance to whether applicants for car registration or transfer met the regulations and how to eliminate vehicles that did not comply with the central government's regulations. To handle matters properly, it has decided to establish a "Private Car Use Restriction Review Committee" to be responsible for reviewing and researching this work. As for the composition of the committee, it has also been decided that each of the seven units of the city government, the Health Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, the City Council, and the Import and Export Management Committee will send a representative to form it. Once the committee is established, all applications for registration or transfer of private cars must first be submitted for review and decision before the Public Utilities Bureau handles them.</p>
<h3>Advising Frugality at Banquets Officially Begins Yesterday; Director Yu Explains the Mission</h3>
<p>The police bureau's work of advising frugality at banquets officially began yesterday. Director Yu Shuping specially invited reporters from various newspapers to the police bureau yesterday afternoon to report on the tasks and new facilities that the bureau is responsible for in order to implement the central government's decisions and promote the frugality movement. Director Yu reported that the juvenile police were selected from disaster victims in refugee shelters, while the female police officers were mostly selected from female youth troops. The selection of these police talents has profound significance. The juvenile police were originally child refugees. Their assignment to promote frugality not only externally fulfills police duties, but also internally stimulates the conscience of the generally extravagant. It is believed that restaurant merchants and diners will assist the juvenile police in completing their mission with a spirit of "being concerned about the hungry and drowning." The female police officers are mostly female youth troops who graduated from high school and were introduced to the bureau by Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo. After selection, they were organized into teams for training, and now there are a total of forty-three of them. They have received strict military education and have been baptized by the revolution. Having them take on the work of advising frugality and rectifying customs is an ideal thing. As for their working methods, they will be either open or secret. The so-called secret means wearing plain clothes and going to various restaurants as customers to secretly investigate.</p>
<p>Director Yu added that the juvenile police are currently in training. Once their uniforms are made, in about a week, they will be able to work. The female police officers are also waiting for their uniforms to be made. Currently, the work of advising frugality at banquets is temporarily being undertaken by personnel from the Business Section of the Administrative Office. Dozens of people have been dispatched to various restaurants since the 29th to carry out the work.</p>
<h3>New Director of the Commodity Tax Bureau, Shi Shouchang, to Assume Office Next Month</h3>
<p>Shi Shouchang, the new Director of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, is scheduled to complete the handover procedures with the former Director at the end of this month and assume office on the first of next month.</p>
<h3>Custom House Clock to Be Set Back Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Daylight saving time in the city will expire at the end of the month. The Jianghai Custom House clock will be set back one hour starting at midnight tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Society Proposes Three Fundraising Methods; Formally Submitted to the City Council</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The chairman of the Winter Relief Committee formally submitted a proposal to the City Council yesterday regarding winter fundraising methods for review and approval. The three proposed methods in the proposal are:</p>
<p>Issuing refugee relief lottery tickets.</p>
<p>Adding 20% to the entertainment tax.</p>
<p>Organizing a charity horse race.</p>
<p>Yuan Wenzhang, the fourth director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the City Hall yesterday to consult with Secretary-General Shen on the development of winter relief work. According to Director Yuan, fundraising for winter relief is difficult this year. Last year, the UNRRA allocated a large amount of flour, blankets, and clothing, etc., but this year there is none, and the number of refugees awaiting assistance is greater than this year. The drama and film industries believe that the entertainment industry is already in a precarious situation today, and adding a 20% winter relief donation will further affect business. This matter will be discussed further at 10 AM today.</p>
<h3>Winter Relief Donations to Be Collected by Three Banks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee Fundraising Committee was established the day before yesterday and is located on the third floor of the Pudong Building on Zhongzheng East Road, and will begin operations immediately. Shanghai Bank, Xinhua Bank, and Zhonghui Bank have been designated to collect donations.</p>
<h3>Our Five Visiting US Journalists Return to Shanghai; Visited Political and Cultural Institutions in the United States; Attended President Truman's Press Conference</h3>
<p>Due to engine failure on Wake Island, there was a 36-hour wait on Midway Island. After flying to Guam, they stayed there for another 12 hours because it was too late to arrive in Shanghai before midnight on the 28th. They flew out of Guam at 4 AM yesterday morning and arrived at Longhua Airport at 10:10 PM. Although they had a long journey, they showed no signs of fatigue and were in high spirits. (The attached photo shows the five reporters and well-wishers at the airport; from right to left: Zhao Minheng, Chen Xunian, Mu Keng, Cheng Cangbo, Zhang Guoxun, Bu Qingmao, Wang Xianting, photographed by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Fire at the Pinghe Warehouse Destroys a Large Quantity of Cotton; Losses of 150 Million</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) A fire broke out at the Pizi warehouse of the Pinghe Foreign Firm in Huangpu, Tilanqiao, at around 1 PM yesterday, destroying fifty to sixty bales of packed cotton and a large amount of loose cotton, estimated to be worth at least 150 million yuan. It is reported that the cotton was shipped from India to Shanghai and had just been unloaded into the warehouse yesterday morning. The cause of the fire is said to have been a carelessly discarded cigarette butt.</p>
<p>A bungalow at No. 745 Jianguo West Road, formerly a White Russian bar, is now closed. At around 3 PM yesterday, the bungalow suddenly caught fire. The fire department dispatched vehicles to put out the fire, which was extinguished after about an hour, resulting in the destruction of one room of the bungalow.</p>
<h3>Land Rights Dispute at Jiangwan Racecourse; Englishman Sues China Trust Bureau for Return</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office of the Central Trust Bureau (legal representative Wu Renchang) was sued in the Civil Court yesterday by the Racecourse General Association (legal representative Englishman Nord), requesting confirmation that the 1,215 mu, 5 fen, and 4 li of land at Jiangwan Racecourse in Shanghai, together with the buildings and fixtures on it, belong to the Racecourse General Association, and requesting the court to order the defendant to return the property to the plaintiff in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>The complaint stated that the plaintiff sold 1,215 mu, 5 fen, and 4 li of land at Jiangwan Racecourse in Shanghai, together with the buildings and fixtures on it, to the Shanghai Hengchan Company on February 10, 1939, subject to a condition of rescission, and entered into a contract stating that the purchase price was 760,000 legal tender yuan, to be paid in three installments. The first installment of 80,000 yuan was to be paid in cash upon signing, the second installment of 320,000 yuan was to be paid on March 17, 1940, and the third installment of 360,000 yuan was to be paid before February 1, 1942. The contract also stipulated that if the buyer delayed the payment of the second or third installment, the buyer should return all the occupied land, buildings, and fixtures to the plaintiff. After the contract was signed, in addition to the first and second installments already paid, Hengchan Company did not pay the third installment of 360,000 yuan as scheduled. Until October 30, 1942, nine months after the agreed date, the buyer suddenly transferred the 360,000 yuan into 180,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one without the consent of the plaintiff, and deposited it into the account of the Shanghai Racecourse General Association at the former Korean Bank, claiming that the payment had been completed. However, according to the contract, this transfer of property rights was actually invalidated due to Hengchan Company's delayed payment. After the victory, the plaintiff believed that the property rights of this racecourse land still legally belonged to the plaintiff, so it repeatedly requested the defendant (China Trust Bureau) that had taken over the land to return it, but the defendant did not agree. Later, the Executive Yuan decided to confirm that this case was a legal act with a condition, so the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit with the court requesting a judgment. It is reported that the case has been scheduled for hearing by Judge Xu Fuji of the Civil Court on the 31st of this month.</p>
<h3>Traffic Police Car Collides with Freight Train Between Longtan and Qixia Mountain; One Traffic Policeman Killed and One Injured; Various Trains Slightly Delayed</h3>
<p>An accident occurred between a traffic police patrol car and a freight train between Longtan and Qixia Mountain on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line the night before last, resulting in one traffic policeman killed and one injured. Various trains were slightly delayed. According to a spokesman for the railway bureau, at 19:13 on the 28th, Yuan Zhenglin, the driver of traffic police armored motor vehicle No. 632, departed from Zhenjiang Station to patrol the line to Hepingmen. At 20:53, after arriving at Qixia Mountain Station, he obtained information about the section of road between Qixia Mountain and Yaohuamen, but instead of driving directly to Yaohuamen Station, he drove towards Longtan. At that time, freight train No. 506 had already passed Longtan at 20:58 and could not avoid the collision, resulting in a collision at the 282-kilometer mark between Longtan and Qixia Mountain, killing one traffic policeman and injuring another on the spot. The gear selector of locomotive No. MCCS-1188 of freight train No. 506 was damaged, and motor vehicle No. 632 was severely damaged. After learning of this situation, the railway dispatching office telegraphed the Nanjing Main Station to report to all relevant parties in the Nanjing-Wuxi section. At 22:46, an engineering motor vehicle and rescue train departed from Nanjing and arrived at the scene of the accident at 23:35. The head of the Nanjing-Wuxi Transportation Section ordered the No. 506 freight train to return to Longtan, and the damaged patrol motor vehicle was also towed to Longtan by engineering motor vehicle No. 711, which was at 0:35 on the 29th. Fortunately, the railway line was not damaged, and the road between Longtan and Qixia Mountain was completely cleared at 2:00 on the 29th. Trains No. 9, No. 10, No. 11, No. 12, and No. 16 were all slightly delayed as a result. It was found that the accident was purely caused by the traffic police patrol vehicle not following the railway regulations, and the railway authorities have raised the issue of responsibility for the accident with the Traffic Police Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Arbitration Issues of the Joint Electric Power Plant; Article 13 Amended</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Article 13 of the Shanghai Joint Electric Power Plant contract stipulates that in the event of disputes, the President of the International Court of Justice shall appoint an arbitrator to make a fair judgment. At the last meeting of the Municipal Council, it was considered damaging to sovereignty, and the debate was quite heated. The Public Works and Regulations Subcommittees of the Council held a special meeting yesterday to further study the matter.</p>
<p>According to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau, after the meeting, the subcommittee reached a concrete resolution to amend Article 13 as follows:</p>
<p>In the event of disagreements over the contract or disputes over power supply technology, the company and the government shall each appoint an arbitrator to make a fair judgment.</p>
<p>If the opinions of the above-mentioned arbitrators differ, making it impossible to resolve the issue, a third party may be appointed as an arbitrator with the consent of both parties.</p>
<p>If an arbitrator is difficult to produce (i.e., when both parties cannot agree), according to the original text of the contract, the President of the International Court of Justice is requested, in a personal capacity, to arbitrate in China. However, the subcommittee believes that involving the Court feels somewhat uncomfortable, so it has been decided to amend it to "request the President of the British Institute of Electrical Engineers (i.e., the well-known I.E.E.F.) to appoint an arbitrator from a third country to arbitrate in China." According to Director Zhao, the subcommittee discussed this point quite seriously yesterday, and the article has been nearly finalized after the amendment. Therefore, it should be possible to pass it smoothly when the Council convenes a general meeting this time.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Refugees and Unemployed Workers Appeal for Issuance of Suburban Tricycle Licenses</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Tang Guangya, Wang Zhuzhai, and other representatives of Northern Jiangsu refugees and unemployed workers held a press conference yesterday to appeal to the Public Works Bureau to promptly issue suburban tricycle licenses in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council. In summary: They, including their families, number more than 20,000 people. Last year, they fled to Shanghai because their hometowns were ravaged by communist bandits. They purchased tricycles with high-interest loans to earn a living by carrying passengers. The vehicle licenses were all purchased by the tricycle companies from Baoshan and Jiading counties and resold to them at high prices. However, after operating for less than a month, they were banned by the authorities. After being deceived, they sent representatives to petition the authorities many times. Subsequently, the Municipal Council resolved at its third meeting to approve the allocation of 1,179 suburban tricycle licenses, and at its fourth meeting, it reviewed and passed the case again to maintain their livelihood. However, the Public Works Bureau has not made any statement nearly a month after the adjournment of the Council, and there is currently a move to suspend the licensing of operating vehicles. They are extremely anxious, so they have raised several points to appeal to the authorities:</p>
<p>They now have nowhere to return, and the problem of their livelihood in Shanghai urgently needs to be resolved.</p>
<p>The traffic congestion in the city is limited to the urban area, and it seems that suburban vehicles can still be allowed to operate.</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Council has already made a resolution, please, in view of the imminent winter and the difficult life of the refugees, promptly approve the issuance of licenses.</p>

<h3>Seeking a Child Causes Disaster; Young Woman's Violent Death Implicates Doctor</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Song Pan, a young woman at No. 5 Tianbao Lane, Xinjiang Road, had been praying to gods and Buddha day and night because she had not become pregnant after marriage, which led to mental illness. She made noise every night. Her husband bought dozens of sleeping pills and instructed his mother to give her half a pill before going to bed to avoid disturbing others' sleep. Recently, she had improved slightly in the evenings, so they stopped giving her the pills. The remaining ten pills were hidden in the cigarette case. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 24th of this month, her mother-in-law called Song Pan to get up and empty the chamber pot, but she did not wake up after being called for a long time. Knowing something was wrong, she checked the hidden pills and found that they were gone. She realized that she had taken poison. However, she discovered that Pan still had body temperature, so the mother-in-law planned to send her to the hospital for treatment. However, the neighbor women advised against it, saying that hospital expenses were too high, and advised summoning Zang Zhiting to inject a cardiotonic injection. However, it was ineffective, and she soon died. On the afternoon of the 24th, the police bureau summoned and interrogated her. He admitted that he was not a registered doctor, but he injected her out of a sense of righteousness, but he did not expect that Song Pan had been deeply poisoned and could not be saved. The police bureau believes that Song Pan's death was ultimately due to an overdose of sleeping pills or due to improper dosage. A forensic examination is still needed. Yesterday, he was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation on charges of manslaughter. Prosecutor Li Mingshan briefly questioned him and ordered him to be released on bail pending trial.</p>

<h3>Viewing the Ryukyus from Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Aeronautical Dispatch from Taipei, 27th of the month] Recently, the Ryukyu issue has aroused unanimous concern at home and abroad. Taiwan, due to its geographical relationship, is closely related to the Ryukyus, and the general public is particularly concerned. Therefore, when President Zhang visited Taiwan, reporters asked him about this matter. In the past, the number of Ryukyuans seeking a living in Taiwan reached more than 15,000. After the restoration [of Taiwan to Chinese rule], all of them were sent back, leaving only more than 60 people employed, most of whom were fishermen. According to overseas Chinese who recently returned to Taiwan from the Ryukyus, the current situation of the island is as follows: on the Ryukyu Islands, which are sixty li in diameter, not a single complete house cliff remains after the baptism of artillery fire. Only the capital city of Naha has a small cement building remaining, while the rest has been completely leveled. The lives of the residents are extremely difficult, because there is no cultivation of food crops on the island, and all vegetables must also be obtained from outside. The public roads are very good, with high-grade cement road surfaces and also pebble roads. In the northern part of the island, the US military has constructed projects. There are also supplies among them for China. Only two or three people from our country are on the island, handling material supply matters, and most of the food and daily necessities needed are shipped from Shanghai. Naha, the capital of the Ryukyus, is 313 [nautical] miles from the base port (Keelung is 426 nautical miles from Shanghai). It is a place where typhoons pass through Taiwan to attack Japan every year. The US military meteorological headquarters on the island and the meteorological bureau of this province regularly exchange meteorological information. When President Zhang inspected Keelung, a representative of 3,000 members of the Ryukyu Revolutionary Comrades Association, Xiyou Ming, submitted a petition to President Zhang requesting that the Ryukyus be returned to our country. It is understood that Xi is a Ryukyu fisherman and is currently employed in Taiwan, residing permanently in Keelung. Smuggling is rampant in Taiwan province. It is said that most of it involves small boats sailing to the waters of the Ryukyus to exchange goods. President Zhang also inquired about this matter in Taiwan, but the authorities had no specific figures to provide for reference. As for the news of Japanese Ryukyuans who were detained for smuggling into Taiwan, this newspaper published it on the 23rd. The "Smuggling Law" has been abolished, and the authorities have no way to deal with such cases.</p>

<p>[Dispatch from Guangzhou, 27th of the month] In the Dongjiang area of Guangdong Province, which was devastated by floods, almost nothing remains.

<h3>Zhang Qun Visits Zheng Chenggong Shrine, Ascends Chihkan Tower, and Composes a Poem Expressing Sentiments</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] On the 27th, Zhang Qun visited the Zheng Chenggong Shrine in Tainan, toured Chihkan Tower, and composed a poem, prefaced by the following short note:</p>
<p>" 'A lone minister lacks the strength to reverse fate; a resurgence is unpredictable,' are both lines from Qiu Fengjia's poems. The restoration of Taiwan means the aspirations of the martyrs since Zheng Chenggong have been fulfilled. On the second day after the commemoration of the Restoration in the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], I ascended Chihkan Tower, contemplating the past from a height, and composed this to express my feelings." The poem reads:</p>
<p>"Leaning high, contemplating the past evokes profound emotions; Ten thousand miles of sails, the sea air clear; Resurgence will eventually succeed; A lone loyalty does not let down Zheng Yanping."</p>

The slopes on both banks will remain at a ratio of one to two. five, and it is estimated that this immortal undertaking will be completed in two years. In terms of the dike restoration project of the Yi and Shu Rivers, it is planned to strengthen and straighten the dikes at the tail end of the Yi and Shu Rivers, thoroughly repairing the gaps and weak points. Regarding the construction of coastal dams, it is planned to selectively build sea water gates at Sheyang, Xinyang, Doulong, Wangzhu, He'e and other ports to regulate the water level in eastern Funing. In terms of industry, mining, and transportation, it is planned to pave the Yangqing Highway, restore telecommunications traffic in the six counties of Gao, Shi, Huai, Si, Lian, establish power plants in Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Gaoyou, Shiying and other counties, and a water plant in Xuzhou.</p>

<h3>"Mayan," Ten Times More Poisonous Than Opium, Strictly Prohibited by Sichuan Provincial Government</h3>

"Mayan": In the southern Xinjiang area of ​​Xinjiang province, hemp is abundant, with velvet growing on the leaves. When ripe, the locals scrape and accumulate the velvet on the leaves along with the attached sand and soil, and then boil them into a paste, which becomes Mayan. This smoke is extremely spicy, and after addiction, people will experience muscle wasting, yellow and swollen eyes, and nerve numbness, becoming semi-disabled.

<h3>The Truth About the Illegal Activities of the Democratic League</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 3)</p>
<p>2. The Democratic League colluded with Li Jishen and the Communist bandits to arrange military uprisings in South China.</p>
<p>From March 21st to 22nd, the "Guangdong Armed Work Committee" of the Communist bandits' Guangdong Provincial Committee decided to develop rural armed uprisings, establish the pseudo "Guangdong People's Armed Liberation Committee" as a command organ, and stipulate that the committee would be composed of seven people, and invite five "advisors," including one from the Communist bandits' pseudo-center, two local representatives of the Communist bandits, one from the Democratic League, and one social activist. The province was divided into six sub-districts, each with a command post. The minutes of the meeting have been seized.</p>
<p>In May of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], the South China Bureau of the Communist bandits issued a document titled "New Tasks for the Current Special Struggle in the Two Guang Provinces," stipulating the use of the Democratic League, the "Sanminzhuyi Comrades United Association" (a reactionary organization of Li Jishen et al.), the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, etc., to form a "political alliance" and a "military alliance." The original document stated: "The Party must establish bases for the Democratic League," "establish a central department in Hong Kong," "the political alliance will be centered on the Democratic League, and the military alliance will be centered on the Zhang Yan faction," "the future leader of the League should be Li Jishen and others," "convene a joint meeting of the leaders of the Yue and Gui factions headed by Li Jishen and Cai Tingkai, the Peasants' and Workers' Party, Sanlian, overseas factions, and leaders of military organizations in various places…" etc. This document has also been seized.</p>
<p>3. Du Bincheng colluded with the Communist bandits to incite mutiny among the National Army.</p>
<p>According to the confession of Chen Jianzhong, a communist bandit collaborator captured in Changchun: "The China People's Autonomous General Association is chaired by Li Jishen, and the location is probably in Hong Kong. I only heard that personnel are responsible in the Nanjing area, the Central Plains area, and the Southwest area. In the Northwest area, Du Bincheng or personnel of the Chinese Communist Party are responsible." It was found that Du was the chairman of the Northwest General Branch of the Democratic League (Li Shuren, an executive committee member of the General Branch, went to the bandit area in northern Shaanxi in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946] to serve as the president of the pseudo-Yan'an University; Guan Mengjue went to the bandit area in Northeast China in October of the 35th year to serve as the director of the pseudo-Nenjiang Province Education Department), colluding with the Communist bandits and secretly serving as the person in charge of the Communist bandits' Guanzhong Local Committee, and successively inciting National Army generals Kong Congzhou and Zhao Shoushan to defect to the bandits, and plotting a riot, which was confirmed by the Shaanxi Provincial Garrison Headquarters, and handled according to law. 4. Li Yinfeng of the Democratic League colluded with the Communist bandits to plot an armed riot in northeastern Sichuan.</p>
<p>Li Yinfeng, a member of the Democratic League, was originally a disgruntled military man from Sichuan. After joining the Democratic League, he actively contacted disgruntled military men to incite mutiny among active-duty officers, recruited military and technical talents, colluded with Li Xiannian's troops of the Communist bandits, and plotted to launch an armed riot in northeastern Sichuan. The police and security organs cracked the case and arrested Li Zibo, Xiao Mingding, He Leisong and others together. They all confessed without hesitation.</p>
<p>(D) The Democratic League joined forces with the Communist bandits to incite labor and student movements.</p>
<p>1. Inciting labor unrest</p>
<p>The Shanghai Quanggong Building incident was a joint anti-American movement rally manufactured by the Communist bandits and the Democratic League. Disputes arose at the meeting place, causing fights. On February 28th of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], Chen Jiakang, a representative of the Chinese Communist Party delegation in Shanghai, convened a meeting with Huang Yanpei, Shi Fuliang of the Democratic League, and Ma Xulun and Pan Zhenya of the China Association for Promoting Democracy to discuss expanding the Quanggong Building incident. The key points of the resolution were as follows: Strengthen the organization of the Liang Renda funeral committee, with Ma Xulun in charge. Expand the campaign to mobilize various trade unions to respond. Strengthen the publicity of the "Truth about the February 9th Massacre" and increase the issuance of propaganda. The "Love Chinese Goods and Resist American Goods Association" will be organized by Shen Junru under the guidance of a division. Hire a lawyer to sue the inspection office in the local court, with Shi Liang in charge. Launch student response, with Pan Zhenya in charge. Maintain the "Shanghai Student Anti-Violence Federation" organization and strengthen it.</p>
<p>On May 6th, Han Zhuoru and others from the Beijing Municipal Office of the Democratic League held a meeting to discuss the group movement work instructions issued by the headquarters and decided: Organize dock workers and transportation workers (including railways) in Xiaguan. Strengthen the league activities within National Central University, and other schools should also develop organizations. Develop agricultural movements in the suburban areas of the city. The women's movement should establish a women's movement team as soon as possible to organize women's peripheral groups.</p>
<p>In October, Li Xiangfu of the Democratic League instructed league members in Beijing to develop organizational relationships with workers at the Beijing Water and Electricity Plants in order to launch strikes, disrupt water and electricity, and disrupt the social foundation when necessary. The police and security organs have obtained accurate information on the above facts.</p>
<p>2. Inciting student movements: On the eve of the May Student Movement in the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], the Student Union of National Central University was re-elected. The Beijing Municipal Office of the Democratic League used huge sums of money to support Mei Zhenqian's campaign. Guo Hengqu and Liao Zuyuan successively received 9 million yuan in activity funds from Li Xiangfu (6 million yuan once, and 3 million yuan once).</p>
<p>The Communist bandits and the Democratic League planned to start the May Student Movement with the May Fourth Memorial. The second item of the Shanghai Communist bandits' "May Work Plan" stipulates "Launching a student movement, with the May Fourth Memorial as the activity center, the anti-violence associations of various schools as the backbone, each university as the activity target, creating bloodshed as the goal, and continuing to initiate petitions and demonstrations as a form of struggle." The so-called Anti-Violence Association is the anti-American movement organization formed by professional students organized by the Communist bandits and the Democratic League in various schools on the pretext of the Shen Chong incident in Beiping.</p>
<p>On May Fourth Memorial Day, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, Wang Shaohe, Shi Fuliang, Ma Yinchu and others went to major middle schools and universities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou to give speeches and openly incite. Subsequently, the "May Fourth Incident" occurred at the Shanghai Law School. On May 5th and 6th, the Shanghai Branch of the Democratic League held a meeting to decide to fully expand this incident in order to brew a full-scale student movement.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the newly elected members of the Student Union of National Central University stirred up another student movement under the pretext of the "movement to increase public funds," which reached its peak on "May 20th." In the course of the student movements in various places, the Democratic League in Beijing and Shanghai continued to gather to study and guide the student movements, focusing them on the slogans put forward by the Chinese Communist Party, such as "Anti-Hunger, Anti-Civil War, Anti-Conscription, Anti-Grain Collection." The Beijing Municipal Democratic League held three important meetings at Lan Jiazhuang and Meiyuan New Village (May 11th, 25th, and 28th). The Shanghai Municipal Democratic League held two important meetings at Zhang Bojun's and Wang Shaohe's residences (May 24th and 25th).</p>
<p>After the "May 20th" student movement expanded, Huang Yanpei, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun and others of the Democratic League continued to raise more than 70 million yuan in activity funds in the name of condolences. On the evening of the second day of the strike at National Central University (the 14th), Shi Fuliang took 2.6 million yuan from Li Xiangfu at Meiyuan New Village and transferred it to the professional students in the Student Union of National Central University. During the student movement, professional students constantly went to the Beijing Municipal Office of the Democratic League. The Democratic League sent Luo Ziwei, Jin Ruonian and others to contact various schools. Zhang Bojun, Huang Yanpei, Liang Shuming, Ma Yinchu and others also took turns to give public speeches at National Central University, Jinling University and other schools to incite them. Shen Junru, Liu Wang Liming and others wrote to the Senate in Shanghai in the name of the "International Human Rights Protection Association" to protest. The Beijing Municipal Office and the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the Democratic League also issued documents such as "Opinions to Fellow Students of the Gu School" and "Opinions on the Current Student Movement" to strengthen the incitement work.</p>
<p>The Southern General Branch of the Democratic League in Hong Kong issued a telegram on May 30th to denigrate the government, and issued a telegram of condolence to students in various places in the name of "Democratic People from All Circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon." On June 1st, it convened the "Conference Against the Civil War and Promote Peace" and published the "Anti-War" special issue and the "June 2 Special Issue" to incite the dragon workers, strikes, school strikes, war strikes, and advocate the overthrow of the government and the formation of a coalition government.</p>
<p>3. Secret documents found in the student movement The police and security organs not only obtained intelligence about the collusion between the Democratic League and the Communist bandits to jointly instigate student movements, but also obtained many secret documents. The important ones are as follows:</p>
<p>In February, the Communist bandits' "Summary of the Anti-Civil War and Anti-Dictatorship Movement of National Sun Yat-sen University" was seized in Guangzhou, stating that the February student movement in the school was the responsibility of the Democratic League and the assistance of the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou in May, a document titled "Decisions on the Student Movement in Hong Kong and Kowloon" issued by the Organization Committee of the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League after convening a student movement review meeting on June 3rd was seized. It contained a detailed review of the May Student Movement in Hong Kong and Guangzhou and indicated the direction for planning new student movements in the future.</p>
<p>In Shanghai in June, a document titled "Summary of the Current Student Movement and Instructions for Future Work" issued by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist bandits on June 15th was seized. It stated that the May Student Movement in Beijing and Shanghai was led by the Communist bandits, with the Democratic League coming forward, and exposed the conspiracy of the "June 2" and "General Strike" and the future direction in detail.</p>
<p>During the emergency response to the "June 2 Riot" in Dongqing and Chengdu, the members of the Democratic League detained by the police and security organs have all separately confessed to inciting labor unrest, student unrest, rice unrest, and being members of the Communist bandits.</p>
<p>E. The Democratic League's activities to undermine the National General Mobilization Order for Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>1. Hong Kong - After the government issued the General Mobilization Order for Suppressing Bandits and Quelling the Rebellion, Peng Zemin, the chairman of the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League in Hong Kong, delivered a speech on July 9th, promoting the Democratic League's call for "using the general mobilization of the people to oppose the general mobilization of the government." On the same day, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Branch of the Democratic League issued a speech, declaring "Calling on all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong to unanimously oppose" and "Resisting the General Mobilization Order," "Opposing the government's general mobilization with the people's general mobilization" and other words.</p>
<p>2. Nanjing - In August, Luo Longji and Li Xiangfu of the Democratic League, in the name of the "China People's and Civil War League," wrote and printed leaflets to undermine the General Mobilization Order and incite strikes, market strikes, resistance to conscription, and resistance to grain collection. The leaflets were personally revised by Li Xiangfu, and Jv Xinmin. Luo Longji decided to print and distribute them. Member Zhao Chaofan discovered his conscience and photographed the original manuscript and surrendered to the Central Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>3. Northeast - Xinhua News Agency of the bandits broadcast Yan Shihang's article on September 18th for the Communist bandits' "September 18th" commemorative special issue, slandering the head of state and calling on the people of Northeast China to support the rebellion and overthrow the government.</p>
<p>4. Singapore - From September 27th to 29th, the Democratic League held the first All-Malaya Representative Congress in Singapore, established the Malaya Branch, with Hu Yuzhi as chairman, and declared "Currently, the Chinese Communist Party opposes the government, and we also oppose the government. The Chinese Communist Party advocates the establishment of a democratic government, and we also advocate the establishment of a coalition government." He then read Zhang Lan's admonition, the main points of which were to oppose the National Congress and oppose the Constitution. Among the resolutions of the conference were: To telegraph support for the central government's new policies of the League, To support the "People's Liberation War" in the motherland in order to realize the coalition government as soon as possible, To telegraph opposition to all "traitorous and dictatorial" crimes of the government, etc. At the closing ceremony, Hu Yuzhi entertained reporters and declared: In order to achieve the goal of overthrowing the government and establishing a coalition government, the Democratic League is willing to fight together with the Chinese Communist Party, Li Jishen and others, and other non-partisan people.</p>
<p>The above sections point out that the Democratic League has now become a conspiracy and riot group that opposes the Constitution and subverts the government. The words and actions of its general branches in various places are in cahoots with the Communist bandits and are no different. The people in charge of its headquarters are secretly engaged in underground work on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are still trying to make a vague posture to cover up their conspiracy and riot, and to confuse the vision of people at home and abroad. Now the Communist bandit military in Shandong has completely failed, and the bandit army of Jinji is pouring south, trying to break up into parts south of the He and Huai Rivers, avoiding the real and attacking the virtual, in order to disrupt social order and shake the hearts of the rear. The Democratic League is even more of an assistant to their underground work and rumor offensive, and has become a major threat to social security in the rear. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Directors and Supervisors of the Textile Federation Requests Postponement of the Implementation of Allocation and Sales, Seeks a Reasonable Plan that Must Take Both Sides into Consideration, Designates an Eight-Person Group to Continue Discussions Today</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The National Textile Federation held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM yesterday, presided over by Chairman Du Yuesheng himself. Before the meeting, a supplementary inauguration ceremony was held, supervised by Ouyang Lun, representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Wang Jiashu, representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The ceremony was grand. After the routine cases were discussed, representatives from the six district associations made a temporary motion to discuss the issue of joint allocation and sales of cotton yarn. After the representatives from the six districts gave oral statements on the development of the case, it was decided that the case was related to the future of the national textile industry's production, and it was often submitted for discussion. The speeches were fierce, and the discussion lasted for more than three hours. The common opinion was that the so-called joint allocation and sales with vouchers had many difficulties, the main ones being three:</p>
<p>First, the so-called joint allocation and sales are scheduled to be a "voucher" allocation system. However, under the current situation where production and consumption are out of balance, the conditions for voucher allocation and sales are not yet in place. It is difficult to implement it nationwide. If it is only implemented in Shanghai, it will be even more unfair. If yarn merchants in various places request voucher allocation and sales, there will be many disputes, and it will be difficult to achieve good results in practice.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the price issue, the Textile Regulation Committee's explanation of the joint allocation outline is similar to the unified allocation and sales method, and it is by no means a genuine joint allocation among peers. The power to determine the price seems to be entirely in the hands of the government. If the government's purpose is only to stabilize prices, then in the current situation of sluggish production and insufficient supply, prices will inevitably rise higher and higher, making it more difficult to meet the conditions for yarn factories to resume production. The textile industry believes that the greatest difficulty lies in the fact that the power to determine the negotiated price is entirely in the hands of the government.</p>
<p>Third, the original meaning of yarn factories opening their goods was to seek circulation independently, adapt to market conditions, and seek natural development. If all yarn production is forcibly collected by the government, it will inevitably lead to Zhou Zhuan's failure and obstruction. At a time when production has not yet stabilized and money is often stranded, the industry is mostly confused by this and believes that it is difficult to implement. The fact that each factory will lose its operating rights is even more important.</p>
<p>Based on the above three unsolvable difficulties, the association decided to request the government to extend the time limit, reconsider the issue of joint allocation and sales, and strive to obtain a reasonable and feasible plan that can take into account both government national policy and yarn factory production. Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Liu Jingji, Tang Xinghai, Zhang Wenqian, Rong Erren, Zhu Fuju, and Zhang Jian [omitted] were immediately designated to form an eight-person group to hold a group meeting to propose a plan for the government to adopt, in order to seek compromise and guidance, so as to obtain a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>[Another News] After the Textile Federation had held the Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors, Du Yuesheng, in his capacity as Chairman, visited Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Textile Regulation Committee, to report on the situation of the meeting, and then returned to the association to continue convening a group discussion, which lasted for a long time. It is heard that discussions will continue today.</p>
<p>Private Factory Exchanges Opinions</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The six-district cotton spinning association held a regular meeting of executive directors yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, they exchanged opinions on the issue of joint allocation and sales. After the meeting, the association's spokesperson met with reporters and said that whether the textile industry will accept the joint allocation and sales method will be discussed by the National Textile Federation's council meeting. Chairman Du Yuesheng will personally preside over the meeting. It is expected that there will be specific opinions for compromise.</p>
<h3>Rayon Weary, Another Drop of Over 2 Million Yuan</h3>

Nearly ten boxes were traded in the morning.</p>
<p>The silk market continued to decline, and people's hearts became more and more empty.

The Special Shang 28 points of the Jili Qianjing fell by 2 million yuan, and the ordinary fell into the 40 million mark, with the opening of another burden of five burdens, priced at 36 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Scarce Trading Throughout the Day; Forty-Two Blue Phoenix Slightly Lower Than the Previous Day</h3>

Currently popular and fast-selling Serge Yuan Zhi Tribute also rose by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan. Other cloth markets were flat and weak.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Mediocre</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton saw buyers adopt a wait-and-see attitude due to tight credit. The market was briefly weak, and prices softened compared to the previous day. Subsequently, with a slight improvement in cotton yarn, spinning mills made slight purchases, revitalizing the weak trend, and transactions were active. Transactions were mostly conducted by local dealers, with each merchant trading 1240 bales. The factory price for Lingbao was 3.731 million yuan, Shashi was 3.58 million yuan, and Fine Hankou was 3.447 million yuan, with 300 bales transacted.</p>
<h3>Rice Plunges, Flour Follows Suit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of 10,100+ shih of rice. The market trend was in a slump, with prices plummeting in the early market.

Yin Yuan shipments gradually surged, disposing of stagnant goods, plummeting by 350,000 yuan.</p>
<p>There was no new flour arriving and it was in demand, causing it to decline by 89,000 yuan. Wheat bran also similarly contracted by 12,000 yuan. At noon, factories announced that the existing flour warehouse receipts must be cleared within three days, making people feel even weaker. Soybean cake trading was scarce and lacked vitality. There were increasing sources of soybeans arriving, but oil mills were indifferent, and local dealers continued to aggressively cut prices. External buyers' transactions were not strong, and negotiations resulted in a decline of more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Broad beans' southern appetite was not considered, falling by more than 10,000 yuan. Peas moved slightly sporadically, with a weak tone. Green beans from Shantou purchases rose by 120,000 yuan. Cowpeas were picked up in Nanyang, stabilizing the market. Sorghum was moving in distilleries, temporarily stabilizing.</p>
<p>Corn from the North was being selectively purchased at high prices, resulting in a high-priced and subsequently stagnant appearance. Raw peanuts were halted by external buyers, suddenly becoming sluggish, falling back by 450,000 yuan. Sesame saw both external buyers and foreign firms stop buying. Local dealers took advantage of the opportunity to buy slightly, and prices stepped down by 20,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>To Resolve the Raw Material Panic in Yarn Mills, Indian Cotton for Yarn Exchange Begins Registration</h3>
<p>The private yarn mills in our city had previously suggested to the government that they purchase Indian cotton from India to alleviate the current cotton panic. The Textile Export Committee is currently coordinating the matter. According to the person in charge of the committee, the current purchase of cotton from India has been decided to be carried out through barter trade, with our country exchanging cotton yarn for cotton from India. Both parties have also agreed that each bale of 20-count cotton yarn can be exchanged for 1,050 to 1,120 pounds of Indian cotton. 755 pounds of the exchanged cotton will be given to yarn mills to offset the cotton yarn. Of the excess, 60% will go to the Central Bank to cover foreign exchange settlement expenses, etc., and 40% will be allocated to private yarn mills as profit. The committee has now begun registering for this barter method. To date, 14 manufacturers have registered, and the first barter is expected to succeed within the year. As for the transportation of cotton yarn to India and cotton to China, both parties have agreed to use ships for transportation, as air and road transportation costs are higher.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Raw Material Registration: Manufacturers Request Priority Purchase</h3>
<p>Since the government announced the measures for handling goods arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange, the China Cigarette Industry Association, in view of the scarcity of materials in China and the possible interruption of cigarette raw materials, believed that since the raw materials arriving at the port already belonged to the Chinese people, it would be a loss not only to our cigarette industry but also to our country if they were unfortunately re-exported. A joint meeting of directors and supervisors was held on the 23rd of this month to discuss the registration of goods arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange. It was unanimously resolved to support the national policy and apply for registration first, awaiting government handling. However, in order to safeguard the survival of the industry, it was requested that the government consider the difficulties of businesses and allow cigarette manufacturers to directly purchase the registered cigarette raw materials with priority, and to process them in advance.</p>
<p>In other news, among the goods arriving at the port and being shipped without permits and with self-provided foreign exchange, the registered value of tobacco leaves arriving at the port was "US$112,094.86," and the value of cigarette paper was US$1,165,881.68.</p>

In the past ten days, the price of rice has risen from 320,000 yuan to 410,000 yuan per dan (110 pounds), and other commodities have risen by 40% to 70%. Part of the reason for the price increase is that the Hong Kong dollar has risen more than doubled in one month. According to official statistics, the price level in the middle of this month was 64,500 times that of 1937, which means that 10,000 yuan in legal tender is equal to 1 jiao, 5 fen, and 5 li in 1937.</p>
<h3>Individual Applications for Foreign Exchange Must Be Transferred to the National Bank for Review</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 29th] The Ministry of Finance announced: According to the previous measures for managing foreign exchange, individual applications to designated banks for foreign remittances should be transferred to the Central Bank for review. The Savings and Remittance Bureau, as one of the designated banks, will also handle foreign remittances in this manner.</p>
<h3>Bulls Slaughtered Almost Entirely, Hua Stocks Lifeless</h3>
<p>Hua stocks reached a dead end yesterday. Although large Chaozhou dealers knocked in over 100 million shares outside the market, they were still settled by floating profits, and there was no achievement. Trading inside and outside the market was unusually light, lacking energy. Rumors of loans continued, but most bulls had been slaughtered, so even if there was a breeze, it would soon be calmed down.</p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>It was very uncertain, and the opening of each stock saw both gains and losses. Yong Yarn opened at 292 yuan and 294 yuan, but transactions were extremely scarce and retreated to 289 yuan and 290 yuan. It then retreated to 287 yuan and 288 yuan. Although it was supported, it rose slightly. Outside the market, the interest rate opened slightly higher, at 1 jiao, 9 fen and a half and 2 jiao, 4, but the market situation did not improve. Later, when news came that a large Chaozhou dealer had knocked in over 100 million shares outside the market, Guangdong dealers came to buy and settle immediately, and some submitted delivery orders, and it rebounded to the high price of 294 yuan for immediate settlement and 296 yuan for delivery. Soon, it could not get rid of its sluggish state, and near noon, it retreated to the low price of 286 yuan and 287 yuan. The noon closing was 286 yuan and 288 yuan. Except for unpopular stocks, they were all dragged down slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing for immediate settlement stocks, China-France, China Textile, Five Harmonies each fell by half a percent, Commercial Press Datong Underwear Match slightly rose, Cement Jinglun Xinyi was still flat, Yong Yarn Xinnuo Meiya Huafeng Xinguang Jingfu Qinxing Xinhua Xinya Liannong China Silk Tongyi Rongfeng Hengfeng Zhabei Huaxin slightly decreased.

Therefore, methods to increase the trading volume will be discussed at that time.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Slightly Rise, Foreign Stocks Stabilize</h3>
<p>Government bonds yesterday rose slightly after being purchased for speculation. C-E was flat, and B-C opened at 24,000 yuan, fell to 21,900 yuan, and finally hovered around 23,000 yuan.

Securities dealers and retail investors both came in, and foreign firms and banks all sold. Jardine Spinning hovered between 200,000 and 210,000 throughout.

<h3>The Convergence of Eastern and Western Cultures</h3>
<p>— Fu Tongxian</p>
<p>Northrop: The Meeting of East and West, The MacMillan Co.</p>
<p>This is a high-level academic and ideological work published in the United States after the war. The author is Northrop, Professor of Philosophy at Yale University. His theme is how to converge Eastern and Western cultures to seek mutual understanding among human beings and achieve true world peace.</p>
<p>Most people think that the Second World War was different from the First World War in terms of human psychology. They think that there was no ideological conflict in the First World War. The war at that time was fought for democracy, and later Germany failed, and democracy seemed to have won. Afterwards, it was discovered that it was not the case, and everyone still did not understand the meaning of that war. As for this war, everyone can see that there are ideological conflicts everywhere. Everyone understands that the fate of peace depends entirely on whether traditional democracy and Soviet communism can coordinate their political, economic, and religious claims and truly cooperate with each other. However, the author believes that this is not the only ideological conflict, nor is it the most important one.</p>
<p>In Palestine, the beliefs of the Jews and the culture of the Arabs are incompatible; in India, the social views of Muslims and the social views of Hindus are irreconcilable. In Europe, the aristocratic ideology and Taoist concepts of Roman Catholicism and the populist ideology and humanism of Protestant Christians are also conflicting. Similarly, in the East, the Shinto beliefs of Japan and the Confucian and Buddhist ideas of moderation and compassion cannot be reconciled. In the Americas, the traditional Latin American views and the traditional Anglo-American views are also inconsistent. In short, in various different cultures, what one culture believes is right, another believes is wrong; what one culture believes is wrong, another believes is right. Ideological conflicts and different ideologies are prevalent throughout the world. If these contradictions and conflicts are not eradicated, the world will never have a peaceful day.</p>
<p>These problems cannot be solved in practical situations. We must trace the root causes and conduct thorough and objective reviews from a theoretical perspective in order to obtain a correct understanding. This book aims to put effort into this area. According to the author's preliminary analysis, the root cause of these ideological conflicts is the conflict between Eastern and Western cultures. Therefore, the basic question now is how to converge Eastern and Western cultures. After this conflict is resolved, other ideological conflicts can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Based on this theme, the book divides the entire content into two parts. The first part is Western culture. Western culture is divided into six major branches: the dual-rich culture of Mexico, which is itself a complex cultural mixture, including the meaning of ancient Aztecs, the customs of Spanish colonies, the style of 19th-century France, the economy of North America, and the charm of modern Mexico; the free culture of the United States of America; the unique democratic culture of the United Kingdom; the idealistic culture of Germany; the communist culture of the Soviet Union; the Roman Catholic culture. Although these many cultures differ in content, they belong to the same form. Whether in philosophy, religion, or even science, the knowledge content of Western culture is not absolute or final, but is changing and improving. The author believes that this can be traced back to two basic reasons. First, the knowledge of Western science, philosophy, and religion is not derived from intuitive perceptions. This knowledge is based on observation and the pre-establishment of a hypothesis, and then the collection of evidence for deduction. Therefore, second, Western knowledge must have a series of logical reasoning. Based on these two characteristics, we know that Western culture is theoretical, symbolic, and indirect.</p>
<p>The second part of the book discusses Eastern culture. Eastern culture can be divided into three major branches: the culture of Confucianism and Taoism in China; the Shinto culture of Japan; the Buddhist culture of India. Easterners perceive all things and nature in an emotional and intuitive way. Easterners and nature are integrated into one. The so-called "all things are one, forgetting both self and things," is the spirit of Eastern culture. Therefore, Easterners also have two basic concepts about the nature of things. First, nature is an intuitive and complete whole, which is shared by all human beings and all things; second, we directly feel various differences in this complete whole. Based on these two characteristics, we know that Eastern culture is aesthetic, experiential, and intuitive.</p>
<p>The author of this book believes that all art can be divided into two categories. The first category of art uses an intuitive and complete whole as aesthetic material and directly expresses it itself, purely for art's sake. The second category of art uses theoretical methods and techniques to use this intuitive and complete whole as aesthetic material, and uses it to convey the relationship between things. It is a symbol or tool used to convey external objects. Western culture, whether in philosophy, science, economics, politics, or art, belongs to the second category of artistic type; Eastern culture in all aspects belongs to the first category of artistic type. However, our natural understanding of all things should not only have intuitive experience, but also theoretical analysis. The future new worldview should, on the one hand, have intuitive aesthetic materials and directly express itself, and on the other hand, have a logical reasoning method to express intuitive raw materials in symbols. These two aspects are not contradictory but parallel; not only are they parallel, but they are also complementary.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the author's view, the convergence of Eastern and Western cultures is not complete Westernization or complete Easternization. These two cultures will converge into a new world culture, which includes intuitive factors and theoretical factors. At this time, the individual is not only a purely intuitive self; nor is it only a self that is verified by science and recognized by theory. On the one hand, the individual has its intuitive nature, an undifferentiated and coexisting real self with the surrounding people and things; on the other hand, it has its logical nature, an abstract self with special functions in the relationship of a social organization. Therefore, the philosophy of cognitive action with two-term relationship (the two-termed relation of epistemic correlation) laid the cornerstone of the future world culture.</p>
<p>The author, Professor Northrop, has profound knowledge, deep thoughts, and fluent writing. He has a thorough understanding of the cultures of various countries. There are not many Western thinkers who have a deep analysis of Mexican culture, but Northrop's vivid description makes people have a deep impression of Mexico. He is also very clear about the current situation in our country, analyzing the desire for a completely modern Western-style country on the one hand, and being deeply influenced by the Eastern family thoughts with thousands of years of history on the other hand, so that it is still wandering and confused to this day, and it seems that it cannot find a way out in world culture! This point has also been seen by our Chinese scholars. It can be seen that Eastern and Western scholars see the same thing. Therefore, we hope that scholars from both East and West can first have a big unity in culture and thought, start by communicating Eastern and Western cultures, and create a new world culture. This is the most fundamental way to eliminate war and seek world peace. October 20th</p>
<h3>A Plain English Translation of the Constitution of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic of China has been translated into English by Mr. Hao Zhixiang of the Central News Agency and will be published in a separate volume by the Commercial Press in September of this year. The book is formatted with Chinese and English side-by-side. The text is accurate and fluent, allowing people around the world to understand this newly established constitution. At the same time, Chinese people learning English can also study this practical English. There are three differences between the English translation and the original text, which the translator believes are more reasonable expressions in English.</p>
<p>The first article originally states: "The Republic of China is a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People, of the people, by the people, and for the people." The phrase "of the people, by the people, and for the people" is originally an idiom from U.S. President Lincoln, and there were initially objections during the legislative process to using this phrase with such a strong Western flavor. However, the translator did not translate it as the original "of the people, by the people, for the people" but as "of the people for the people and governed by the people." This is because the translator believes that Lincoln's original text only applies to the government and not to the nation.</p>
<p>Article 8 originally states: "Arrest, detention, interrogation, or punishment not in accordance with legal procedures may be refused." The translator believes that if a person is subjected to arrest, detention, interrogation, or punishment, they are physically unable to refuse, and at most, they can only make a mental refusal. Therefore, the translator believes it is best to use the word "protested." However, because the original meaning is refusal rather than protest, the translator had to translate it as "refused."</p>
<p>"複決" (Fùjué) is translated as "referendum," because the translator wanted to be faithful to the original text. In fact, he thinks it should be translated as "ratify" or "vote on."</p>
<p>The entire text is very faithful to the original, which is a characteristic of this English translation of the constitution. However, there are two points we would like to discuss with the translator: (1) The Chinese word "得" (dé) is correctly translated as "may" because it means "can do this, but not necessarily must do this." However, "不得" (bùdé) has a mandatory meaning, so it cannot be translated as "may not," because this means "can not do this, but can also do this." Therefore, we feel that it is best to use "shall." (2) Article 135 originally states "Delegates to the National Assembly from interior areas having peculiar conditions of living and habits." There are two problems with this. First, "國民代表" (Guómín dàibiǎo), or national representatives, does not only refer to representatives of the National Assembly but refers to all kinds of national representatives, so it should be translated as "delegates of the people." Second, the word "peculiar" is inappropriate because sometimes this word can mean "strange" rather than necessarily "special." It should be translated as "particular." We wonder what the translator thinks?</p>
<h3>Introduction to "Pocket-Sized Detailed Provincial Map of China"</h3>
<p>— Gong Peixuan</p>
<p>(Revised 12th Edition, compiled by Jin Qingyu, published by Yaguang and Geography Society)</p>
<p>Chinese people have a deep concept of territory, but their knowledge of geography is poor, which is a common problem. Because the concept of territory is deep, it cultivates the habit of being reluctant to leave one's homeland. Because there is a habit of being reluctant to leave one's homeland, it is difficult to broaden one's mind. Therefore, the desire to acquire geographical knowledge is even more insufficient. However, as the times progress day by day, science leaps forward, and the space for human survival gradually decreases, it is no longer permissible for us to live in a small circle and eke out a living. Therefore, the imparting of geographical knowledge is the common sense that we should have. Humans living in this era must learn geographical knowledge.</p>
<p>In China, finding an accurate world map is almost a difficult task, and finding an accurate and detailed map of one's own country is also not very easy. This pocket-sized detailed provincial map of China, published by Yaguang Geography Society and compiled by Mr. Jin Qingyu, is not entirely satisfactory, but it is relatively useful as a reference.</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about its advantages: This map has been published since the 30th year of the Republic of China, and the revised edition has now reached the 12th edition. In the most recent revised edition, it can correct changes in human aspects at any time, making this map the most up-to-date work, giving the Chinese people a clear understanding of all aspects of attention. For example, the nine northeastern provinces and Outer Mongolia, Tangnu Uriankhai, etc. The provincial maps have markings for the larger market towns, and the locations are quite accurate. This is a very difficult thing to do. According to the author's experience in various provinces and cities over the years, the market towns passed through are generally consistent with the locations on this map. This map is called "pocket-sized," so of course, the size is very small and easy to carry. Making the size small can be done by any map, but making it thorough is not something that any map can do. In terms of thoroughness, this map is generally acceptable.</p>
<p>However, this map is an ordinary reference map, not a map used by scholars, experts, or the military, so it is not an objective attitude to demand that it be complete in every aspect. For example: The terrain is not shown in detail in the sectional maps. The locations of products are not specifically marked in the sectional maps. Municipalities directly under the central government are attached to the sectional maps. The loss of national territory over the years has not been marked. These are all unsatisfactory aspects.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we hope that the following four points will be corrected in the 13th edition of this map: Add terrain contours to the maps; this may be difficult in projection, but several maps on the market have already done it. Clearly mark the production areas or storage locations of products in each province. All municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan should be drawn on a separate page to show their importance and deepen the public's recognition. The loss of Chinese territory over the years has been significant, and it seems that all lost territories should be marked, which would greatly benefit the enhancement of national consciousness.</p>
<p>This map was published in February of this year. At that time, the boundaries of the nine northeastern provinces and the South China Sea were still to be adjusted. Now the Ministry of the Interior has clearly delineated the provincial boundaries of the nine northeastern provinces, and they should naturally be corrected in the next edition. The Xisha Islands in the South China Sea also seem to need a special page after surveying and determination, because they are overseas borders and should strengthen the public's attention. In addition, the author hopes that the compilers can follow Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan and mark out our national construction strategies, which would also be very educational for readers.</p>
<p>As for the minor flaws in this map, the author believes that the explanations are too brief and that there are quite a few typos. For example, in the explanatory text of the Shandong map, the Fangzi of "坊" (Fáng) County is made into the Fangzi of "肥" (Féi) County. Not to mention that Fangzi is not in "肥" County, but Shandong only has a "肥城" (Féichéng) and no "肥縣" (Féi Xiàn).</p>
<h3>The Revelation "Mozart" Gave Me</h3>
<p>— Fei Qiong</p>
<p>"Love shook my heart, like the mountain wind falls on the trees.</p>
<p>"Love shook me—melted limbs love, bitter and sweet, irresistible thing.</p>
<p>—Poef: "To My Beloved"</p>
<p>After reading B. Balázs's three-act play "Mozart," I suddenly remembered the poems of the Greek poet Sappho. My heart felt a tremor.</p>
<p>Was it the life of the great artist Mozart that moved me? No, it wasn't this, but rather the silent sacrifice of his sister that moved me even more.</p>
<p>A person who grows up in a poor family, a person who has nothing but a sincere heart, he sacrifices himself as a sacrifice to art, and inevitably makes his father and his sister (Nannerl Mozart) silently sacrifice along with him.</p>
<p>I say "inevitably" because I have truly surrendered to these great human natures. "Love" shook me, overwhelming my selfishness and indifference.</p>
<p>Also Sappho's poem: "That which seems beautiful must be good, and that which is good will also be beautiful."</p>
<p>The kind Nannerl is by no means a protagonist in the whole play, but she controlled me, and her great love for her brother shook me. When her father said to her: "Nannerl... I know... I know everything... As for me, an old man sacrificing his life is not a big deal; but when you sacrifice your youth and love, sacrifice your happiness and musical skills, that is another matter!" (Sand, page 9)</p>
<p>An old man spends his life copying music for his son; a young girl with musical talent weaves lace all day long for her brother. "That which is good will also be beautiful," so even if the old man said some inappropriate things to his son in the second act, it was also his right, because he had exhausted his strength and his duties.</p>
<p>"That which is good is also beautiful," and I admire Nannerl even more. When her father's credit went bankrupt, she blushed, but firmly and bravely whispered: "I will sign this loan agreement; I will sign... I can guarantee it with my dowry." She is still a young girl, but I cannot help but think of her as a great hero.</p>
<p>I have not yet talked about Mozart, no, I have already talked about him. Growing up in such a family, growing up surrounded by such things, the talented Mozart should have a more brilliant future.</p>
<p>We appreciate Mozart's music, but we forget that Mozart himself is a perfect work of art—a painting, a requiem, a kind and flawless soul.</p>
<p>But society persecuted him. When the theater made a fortune by performing his music, when the girl Aloysia became famous by singing his music, even when a beggar earned bread by playing his music on the street, our genius musician Mozart was suffering for a few ducats.</p>
<p>(The beggar starts playing again, Mozart looks at him, walks up, and takes his violin). Mozart: Old man, lend it to me for a moment. (Starts playing)</p>
<p>Music, if it weren't for you, what would I have become? Ah, music, music...</p>
<p>(He plays, the beggar is moved, and turns his two invisible eyes towards him, passersby gather around: silver coins rain into his hat).</p>
<p>Mozart: There, old man, you play, my bad luck will pass, and my music will last forever.</p>
<p>Beggar: (Confused) Who are you? Which one? Mozart: A popular person these days... a partner of yours, a blind man and musician like you, good night, old man.</p>
<p>(Mozart leaves, he disappears into the night, the blind man takes a few steps, stretching his hands forward as if groping, wanting to follow Mozart).</p>
<p>Mozart called himself a blind man and musician, he still had some self-awareness, Dostoevsky once criticized Tolstoy saying: Tolstoy is a Russian full of a sense of justice, he has his wisdom, but he can only look forward, and never see clearly what is beside him.</p>
<p>Mozart also ignored the surrounding environment, unaware of the cold and terrible world, and did not lose his innocence until his death. Social persecution destroyed his body, but his kind heart was always warm. He struggled, ignoring social persecution, so he called himself blind.</p>
<p>He ignored it when his lover Aloysia flattered the theater owner; he ignored it when Aloysia's mother, Mrs. Weber, played despicable tricks; he ignored it when people who made a fortune by relying on him surrounded him, and he wrote his last few pieces of music. A pure and kind person can never imagine that the world is so cruel, he has to ignore it.</p>
<p>On his deathbed, he finally spat out a few accusations:</p>
<p>"No, Süssmayr, death is not my enemy, if it ruthlessly prevents me from completing this last chapter... it is the enemy of music!"</p>
<p>Only thirty-five years old, he was like that white dove carrying an olive branch, flying above the unclean waves, his wings were already tired, under the cold persecution of the world, he fell down and sank into the unclean waves. This is the end of a pure, lovely, and great soul!</p>
