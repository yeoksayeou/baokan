<h3>府委會爲最高決策機關　國防委會宣告撤銷　工作人員按例給資遣散</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕國防最高委會自廿四日起停止收文，辦理結束，本月底前可望全部竣事。又中央政治委會已在國防會原址開始辦公。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕國防最高委會，以國民政府委員會改組成立，該會職權轉移，頃發出公吿，宣吿撤銷。該會於二十八年一月在渝成立，抗戰期間代行中央政治委員會職權，決定最高國策，歷經十年，卓著偉績；惟該會前身當溯自中央政治會議，則迄今已二十有三年矣。中政會議係民十三年成立於廣州，迨二十四年國民黨五全大會時，始決議改組爲中央政治委會。二十六年抗戰軍興，又決定停止中政會職權並改爲國防最高會議以代之。同時附設國防參議會，廣邀各方人士參加，嗣演變爲國民參政會，即今之全國民意最高機關；迄抗戰勝利，國民黨召開六屆二中全會，議決國府爲決定國務之最高機關並決定撤銷國防最高委會，嗣經中央決定該會應於國府改組成立之日實行結束。茲者國府改組完成，國府委會亦吿成立，該會自應實行撤銷。該會秘霄廳頃已發出公吿，今起停收文件，辦理結束。據悉，該會工作人員將分別予以轉業並依中央黨部發給遣散費前例，按照年資分發遣散費。該會丁家橋原址，聞不久即將移交中政會使用。</p>

<p>〔中央社台北廿四日電〕陳儀今日下午三時於記者招待會上答覆如下：</p>
<p>（問）外間批評公署在政治方面太寬，經濟方面太緊，陳長官意見如何？</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>從華萊士的演辭說起</h3>
<p>美國前任副總統華萊士，週遊歐洲各國，到處發表演說，抨擊杜魯門總統所採取的政策，並危言聳聽，謂第三次世界大戰已不可避免；不僅在歐洲各國發生深刻的印象，就是在美國國內也引起了嚴重的反響；我們從這些爭論中去看世界現勢，更覺得眼花撩亂；但法國社會黨領袖勃魯姆前天在人民報發表一文，表示其對於世界現勢的觀點：一則以為美國不願戰爭，第三次大戰不致爆發；另則認為華萊士與杜魯門總統意見不同之處，厥在方法方面；而其目的則一，大家都締造並鞏固世界和平。我們覺得法國社會黨領袖的見解，和我們對於世界現勢的看法，頗多不謀而合之處，近來與論界對於國際問題的意見，似乎也非常龐雜，有正視現實加以檢討的必要。</p>
<p>這幾天來，可以說是國際上最黯淡的時期，在莫斯科，四國外長會議陷於僵局，不能自拔，行見不歡而散；使喁喁渴望和平的人士，莫不感到心灰意懶；在華盛頓，日來參眾兩院討論援助希士兩國的計劃，充滿了反共產主義的氣氛，展望美蘇關係，亦有每況愈下的趨勢，雖不能謂戰機迫於眉睫，但這樣演變下去，對於世界和平，終是有害無益的。所以怎樣始能促成美蘇兩國的釋嫌修好？又怎樣締造世界和平始獲得成功？確是當前最嚴重的問題，亟待各國政治外交家運用其政治的智慧，謀得合理的解決。</p>
<p>華萊士在英·法·瑞典·挪威·丹麥等國京城，接連發表了好幾次的演說，我們綜合其演詞的大意，可以分為兩點：（一）美蘇之間的矛盾愈演愈深，杜魯門總統所採取的現行政策有使世界再度發生戰禍的可能；（二）美國在聯合國機構之外援助希土兩國，足使此等國家脫離聯合國，而採取為美國所認為滿意之政治行動。其實上述兩點，還是一個問題，換言之，在華萊士心目中，終覺得杜魯門總統所採取的外交政策，是一種具有危險性的反蘇政策，不僅不能引導世界走上和平繁榮的坦途，反而有使世界走向戰爭毀滅之虞。但是我們檢討一下，大戰結束以來的美國外交政策，其基本的目的，在求世界的和平與繁榮，其所採取唯一的途徑，就是儘量增強聯合國機構的權威，凡是有利於世界和平的事情，均為杜魯門總統所樂為者，凡是足以削弱聯合國機構權威的事情，都是杜魯門總統所不願聞者。華萊士的指摘杜魯門政策，在我們第三者看來，並沒有充分的理由，而且我們十二分的相信，華萊士固然希望美蘇諒解，恢復戰時駢肩作戰的精神，其同締造世界和平；就是在杜魯門總統本人何嘗不希望蘇聯的諒解與合作呢？馬歇爾國務卿不辭勞苦前往莫斯科，千方百計，務使美蘇兩國對於德奧問題能成立協議，就是一個絕好的證明。華萊士前天在巴黎說：『美國領導世界走向和平繁榮，是她的職責所在』；記得杜魯門總統於本月初也曾向民主黨演說：『美國對於締造世界和平，責無旁貸，故對於各國人民之自由遭受危險者，均應負有援助之責。』可見華萊士與杜魯門總統，在目的上是完全一致的，並沒有不同的地方。所不同者，僅在美國為欲達到此目的所採取的方法而已。很明顯的，杜魯門總統對於蘇聯，已不惜採取強硬政策，而且認為，『美國為負起締造世界和平的責任起見，必須保有充分之軍事力量，使世界各國相信，美國決意依照其責任行事。』此在華萊士則認這種強硬政策，徒然增加蘇聯的倔強，決不能獲得蘇聯的諒解，如果長此下去：則第三次大戰就不可避免。所以美國對付蘇聯，究應採取強硬態度呢？抑或採取綏靖政策，事事與蘇聯妥協，處處滿足蘇聯的要求。這兩種辦法，究底是那一種為走向和平的大道？至少在目前，誰也不能逆料的。我們回憶一下第二次大戰爆發的經過，誰也不能否認，民主辦家的荏弱無能，以及英國保守黨內閣對侵略者採取綏靖政策，是第二次大戰爆發的近因。所以我們對於華萊士的主張，在原則上確表贊同，但對於其所欲採取的方法與途徑，實在不敢茍同；好在華萊士也有自知之明，他在巴黎也說；『余現所工作之目標，必為美國人民所贊同，但對於獲致和平之途徑。則大半與余意見不同。』</p>
<p>我們站在第三者的立場，說句公平話，美蘇關係演變到這個地步，決非片面一國所造成的；今後要使兩國重修前好，也不是片面一國所能促成的。所以勃魯姆也說，兩國友誼的增進，有賴雙方的努力，何況美蘇關係的癥結，乃在思想的不同與利害的衝突，如何消除思想上的分歧？如何謀得利害的一致？決非空言與蘇聯諒解能奏效的。</p>
<p>現在世界各國，尤其是美國，加拿大，土耳其，希臘等國，都在那裏設法防範共產主義的深入人心了；是非得失，在目前是涌妄下判斷的；不過我們終認為防範是一種消極的措施，而不是一種正本清源的辦法，我們要防制共產主義思想的蔓延，最重要的還在切實改良經濟制度，能使大多數人民的生活得以改善。不過，美國一面積極援助希土兩國，以防制共產主義勢力的侵入；而另一面，對於遭受共黨公然以武力作亂的中國，卻並不引以為憂；甚至對於早已指定貸與中國的五萬萬美元，仍是『撥而不付』。使我們對於美國政策的統一性，不能不有所懷疑。美國不能成為繁榮的孤島，美國旣知防範圍內共產黨的活動，且欲援助希土兩國抵抗共產主義勢力的侵入，對於現正面臨共黨威脅的中國，不論為中國計，或為美國本身計，均有積極予以援助的必要。</p>

<h3>開會四十五日一無成就　外長會議宣告結束　各國代表團紛紛啓程返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：馬歇爾頃已決定在今晚結束外長會議，已命美國代表團第一批人員於廿五日下午啓程同國。末次外長會將對奧國問題作最後一次會談，並決定下次外長會議之地點及日期，大約今年秋間在紐約舉行。馬歇爾將於廿五日晨乘其自備飛機返美，法國代表團擬乘之火車已於一天前準備就緒，倘會議能提早結束，即將於今夜動身。英國代表團之火車將較法國代表之火車遲開廿四小時。又訊：外長會議今夜結束時，史達林將在克林姆宮歡宴各國代表，以示餞別。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科二十四日電〕四强外長會議已於廿四日無結果而散。美國務卿馬歇爾於廿三日發表文吿，嚴詞譴責蘇聯，使歷時四十五日之外長會議一無成就而失敗後，遂決定結束本屆毫無結果之外長會議。馬歇爾已宣佈其離蘇京之意，幷命令第一批美國代表團於二十五日離蘇京。馬歇爾之決定，乃公開承認本屆外長會議全面失敗。按本屆會議之召集，目的原爲草擬對德奧和約。四強早已放棄其獲致對德和約之努力，其主要之障碍，殆爲蘇聯堅持自德國現有生產中提取賠償，及大規模搬移德國產業，幷對和約完成後之德國政體，亦未能獲致協議。對奧和約談判之決裂，乃由蘇聯堅決支持南斯拉夫要求取國割讓領土，以及蘇聯對奧境德國財產要求所引起之爭執。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿三日電〕外長會議今日耗時最久，亦最熱烈，重大問題仍均議而未決。四外長同意於明日試謀結束會議。美國務卿馬歇爾指斥蘇聯妨害對奧和約與美方建議之四國解除德國軍備公約，據稱，如若對奧和約在九月問聯合國大會開會前不能完成，美國贊成將整個閒題移交聯合國大會。關於對奧和約中主要條款及四國公約，西方三國見解一致，蘇聯獨抱異議。莫洛托夫拒絕四國公約，乃以修正方式列入四國問對德國問題之幾乎全部重要爭端。本人僅願聲明一點，即美國政府極鄭重表示，認爲此舉「無異蘇聯政府拒絕該一公約」是也。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫答稱：美國企岡强迫其他各國簽署其草約，而不許作修正。美國代表團之意毋寗可謂「欲以一種更狹隘之新協定替代波茨坦與雅爾達兩協定」。英外長貝文與法外長皮杜爾則設法緩和美蘇爭執。貝文揷語稱；「如有人發起建築東西雙方間之橋梁，最好不加以阻撓」。馬氏復力言自倫敦外長代表會議以來，蘇聯對於澳地利和約迄未有何新建議。蘇聯代表團嗣後表示之意見，非惟未能縮小吾人間之爭論，反而擴大之。最近數日討論對奧和約之三次秘密會議，完全失敗，其惟一建設性舉動乃蘇聯同意英國提案，在明年底以前將所有戰俘交還德國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿三日電〕英國外相貝文今晨與法國外長皮杜爾會晤。據消息靈通人士談稱：此兩外長曾討論及下次四國外長會議之日期及地點。貝文外相贊成下次外長會議在日內瓦舉行。又悉：法國代表團原定於明晚啓程返國，茲已展緩至後日啓程。</p>
<h3>對德各項重要問題留待下次會議討論</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿三日電〕四國外長會議於本日午後五時三十分，討論外次會議所提出之統計表，並再將會議之議程加以檢討，成立下列各項決議。（一）將下列各項問題，交還外次會議繼續加以硏究：（甲）關於德國邦政府組織之一切問題；（乙）關於對德和約規定賠償程序之一切問題。（二）將下列各項問題交還柏林盟國管制委員會辦理或覆議：（甲）四强對於德國解除武裝，肅淸納粹，政治民主化，交換人口以及重行勘定疆界所同意之方針，應即逐一實施：（乙）將四强對於上述五項問題意見不同之點，重行加以硏究；（丙）外長會議對於一九四七年三月淸理普魯士邦之立法已予以批准，亦將通知柏林盟國管制委員會。（三）關於所有一切德國經濟問題，例如經濟統一，工業水準以及賠償問題等暫不討論，留待下次外長會議討論。此外，並請盟國管制委員會就上述三項間題，提供報吿書。（四）關於德國疆界問題，亦留待下次外長會議討論。</p>
<h3>美衆院亦將通過　援助希土案</h3>
<p>衆院外委會主席表示</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕美衆院外交委員會主席伊頓頃表示信心，衆院將步參一議院後塵，通過援助希土方案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿三日電〕外務次官麥克尼爾今日在下院答復質問稱：英國反　由聯合國機構監　美國援助希主之議，因此舉殊久公允。在此種情形下，要求監督，而對他國給予歐洲各國以類似之援助時則否，實爲一種刺激性的歧視。</p>
<h3>美軍艦多艘將讓與希臘</h3>
<p>目的在增强希海軍實力</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社雅典廿三日電〕頃悉：希臘海軍部長威尼才洛斯將與美國駐希聯海軍參贊史奈根堡海軍上將，共同研究增强希臘海軍實力之方法。聞美國將以掃　　若干艘及驅逐　二艘　與希臘云。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹調查會文件神秘失踪</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿三日電〕聯合國秘書處頃宣布：聯合國巴爾幹調査委會所有之文件，在自希臘往土耳其途中神秘失落，不知所在，詳情不明。</p>
<h3>朝鮮問題僵局如難打開　應召開四強會議　傳英政府支持我國主張</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿三日電〕據消息靈通方面人士透露：英政府將支持中國之建議，即主張朝鮮美蘇當局之僵局如不能打開，則召集四强會議（美蘇英中）討論朝鮮問題。同時倫敦泰晤士報發表朝鮮駐英代表團領袖林燈稷致該報編輯之函件，林氏建議美蘇雙方現應同時撤退駐軍而不再彼此等待，然後朝鮮經全國選舉建立本身之政府。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕消息靈通人士今日表示意見稱：蘇外長莫洛托夫接受美國務卿馬歇爾之邀請，對朝鮮問題恢復商討，毫無意義可言，因蘇聯明顯之目的，仍繼續堅持反對臨時託管之朝鮮人，不許其參與組織臨時政府之會商。渠等稱：蘇聯所堅持之點，（此在美國，乃認爲所不能允許之取消言論自由），乃爲一項美國所不能同意接受者。渠等繼稱除非蘇聯準備緩和其立塲，如莫洛托夫函中所表示者，則美蘇共同委員會恢復時，亦無合作之望。有資格方面建議馬歇爾應再發一聲明，指出莫洛托夫之答覆，事實上不能符合接受美國邀請之條件，因其未能同意予朝鮮人言論自由之原則也。大部份觀察家相信，馬歇爾在目前關於朝鮮問題能對蘇獲得眞正協議，頗爲懷疑，但現僅作心理的戰爭，以爲美國國會接受行政當局予朝鮮南部大量經濟援助計劃，預留一餘地而已。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿三日電〕關於美蘇兩國進行談判討論朝鮮之命運一事，頃據此間官方人士宣稱：英國於一九四五年雖曾在莫斯科三國外長會議參加此一問題之討論，但是否參加目下之美蘇談判，則尙未決定。英國在朝鮮之唯一代表，僅爲其駐朝鮮南部之領事一人而已，英國並無軍事代表團駐在朝鮮云。</p>
<h3>蘇駐美大使返任</h3>

<p>聯合國託管理事會舉行首次會議時，紐西蘭代表貝侖特遜（拉美公使）與我國代表劉錯（外交部次長）晤談情形。</p>
<h3>美衆議院辯論國外救濟法案　會議中充滿反共空氣</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕衆議院今日討論三億五千萬元國外救濟法案，未有結果，延至下星期一再行討論。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電〕關於美國撥款三萬五千萬元在聯總停止工作之後援助中·波·匈·義·希·奧等國一項計劃，頃由衆議院開會加以討論。據觀察家稱：本日會議充滿反共空氣，與參院昨日討論援助土希法案時之氣氛，初無二致。衆院本日所討論之法案中，雖規定美國總統對於任何拒不邀守規定條件之國家可停止予以援助，但民主共和兩黨衆議員仍相繼發言，反對援助各爲蘇聯所支配或控制之國家。其中衆議院外交委員會主應伊頓宣稱：共產思想乃爲美國不共戴天之仇，余反對吾人援助美國之敵人，政府當局要求國會核准撥款七萬五千萬美元用以援助外國，國會面臨此種情形甚感困難，世界必須在自由與奴役之間，有所抉擇。前者乃美國所循之途徑，後者則爲蘇聯所循之途徑云。按美國援助中波等國之法案中，規定下列三項保證：（一）救濟物資應不分種族，宗敎或政見，予以分派；（二）受惠國家必須同意儘量公開美國所供給救濟物資之數量，受憲國家對於美國電台及報紙記者之欲觀察救濟物資分配情形者，應保證其完全自由；（三）受惠國家不得將美國之救濟物資讓與他國，或利用剩餘救濟物資維持其軍隊。</p>
<p>國務院已提出救濟專員人選</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜頃致函衆院外交委會主席伊頓稱：國務院進行救濟計劃，現擬任命第一次世界大戰時美紅十字會歐洲救濟專員阿倫主持其事。</p>
<h3>美共黨領袖　有圖謀叛國嫌疑</h3>
<p>湯麥斯要求提起公訴</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國衆議院反美國活動調査委員會主席即民主然衆議員湯麥斯，本日上舊杜魯門總統，要求總統命令檢察官克拉克以「圖謀叛國」罪，向共產黨領袖提出公訴。</p>
<h3>共產黨在澳活動製造工業上擾亂</h3>
<p>〔中央社康白拉廿三日合衆電〕澳外長伊伐特今向衆院稱，澳政府無力禁止共產黨人，彼輩在澳各地製造工業上擾亂，此爲一嚴重危機。</p>
<h3>出席法國議會　華萊士演說　聽衆寥寥多屬共黨員</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿三日電〕前美國副總統華萊士今日向法國上下兩院議員演說，然議員總數千人中，到塲者僅約百人，大多爲共產黨員。華萊士表示爲解決和平問題起見，美國之反共心理必須消滅。華氏又曰，渠並非共產黨而爲進步保守份子。但當某議員詢以渠認蘇聯境內是否亦有進步份子時，華氏似露窘態。華氏並曰，渠支持美國之資本主義，但覺資本主義應迎合潮流。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿四日電〕華來士歐洲之遊將畢，預定今夜發表有關法國之最精警演說。今晨將有法政治集團如人民共和運動·工會·及社會主義各團體之代表，赴喬治五世旅館訪華氏會談，法總理賴瑪迪定午後接見華氏。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕華萊士頃在此間外交政策協會發表演說稱·美國倘仍繼綾推行其現行政策，恐將使本身在一年內，陷入歷史上最不景氣之狀態中。倘能以龐大之陸海軍費，緩和此經濟蕭條，則亦將迫使其他國家在軍事方面作同樣之支出。但倘欲在戰後不再使經濟蕭條長此繼續下去，則美國應以債權國之地位，利用其資源，從事全世界建設性之工作，倘能如行，則英美二國經由聯總進行和平工作所需付出之代價，當可較諸增加軍費爲節省云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕華萊士頃向此間美國退伍軍人委會發表演說稱，余相信美蘇二國今日之作爲，已破壞其靑年人犧牲生命所進行之神聖運動。美國現有一種巨大運動，影響所及，或易引起第三次大戰。以言援助希土之計劃，倘美國越出聯合國而予以援助，且非建設性者，則此等國家將背離聯合　而傾向於美國所認爲合意之政治行動。吾人猶憶杜魯門上年在密蘇里州之富爾頓城介紹邱吉爾時，曾稱之爲「他界公民」，要知「世界公民」之名稱，非輕易所能授人，而須以行動取得之，美蘇二國均願在友好聯繫中，向和平之途邁進，美國政府倘能處事正當，余亦將加以讚揚，倘余以爲一蘇聯行動錯誤，則亦加以抨擊，在憎恨心理危害和平之時，余決不參加任何運動，以使蘇聯陷入孤立，或構成反蘇陣營，致仇恨益深，惟吾將竭盡所能，以促進兩大國家之諒解。</p>
<h3>德境蘇軍曹兩人被英國憲兵擊傷</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿三日電〕柏林蘇聯區內之某報載稱：柏林蘇軍司令柯狄戈夫將軍昨吿盟軍總司令部，謂有蘇軍軍曹兩名被英國憲兵痛毆，一軍曹之一眼已因此失明。柯將軍要求立即澈査此事。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿三日電〕自柏林蘇軍司令柯狄戈夫夫將軍向盟軍總司令部抗議蘇軍軍曹兩人被英憲兵痛毆重傷之事後，此間英當局已正式提出答覆，駁斥蘇方所稱之事實經過情形，聲明該兩蘇軍軍曹係於柏林史班杜區（按即蘇方所稱之出事處）發生與脅迫兩德國婦女事有關之開槍案後被捕。當英憲兵初次往捕時，該兩軍曹即洮入蘇軍區。不料兩人其後復重入史班杜區再度脅迫此兩德國婦女，英憲兵巡邏隊加以阻止，蘇軍曹不聽且以武力拒捕，雙方遂起衝突。兩蘇軍曹均因而受傷。其中一人身受傷痕五處。頭眼及身上均受割傷。另一人頭部亦有傷痕，身上有皮傷。兩人被擒後送入英軍醫院，但彼等拒絕療治，最後即交蘇軍帶去。當出事時該兩蘇軍曹顯然在酒醉狀態中，在彼等被捕後，在出事處發見若干予彈匣及子彈，與在彼等身上抄獲者相同。</p>

<h3>英國退出印度以後</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室譯</p>
<p>英國決定在一九四八年六月退出印度以後，印度爲爭取自由獨立的長期鬥爭將吿一段落，從此印度將脫離英國的覊絆，雖則它是否具備自治能力還毫無把握。英國的此一步驟一半由於英國的軟弱無能，一半由於印度民族勢力的日益膨大。</p>
<p>英國不能決定它的治權將移交給誰。英國工黨政府抱有一種樂觀的見解，認爲時代的需要將使印度準備肩負起它的責任來。其餘的人大都相信獨立的印度終必能在團結的基礎上建立起來。很可能的，印度的未來將變成聯合國的問題，同時，四萬萬人民中間將發生混亂和內戰，也是很可能的</p>
<p>在印度，印度敎徒和回敎徒之間存在着敵對的關係，這決不僅僅是二萬五千萬印度敎徒和九千二百萬回敎徒間的爭執，而是牽涉到宗敎。人物。和政權的一種劇烈的社會鬥爭。甘地和尼赫魯領道下的印度國民大會黨抱有多數黨統治的野心，而眞納領導下的回敎同盟却抱有回敎國分立的決心，兩派相爭甚烈。</p>
<p>英國工黨所抱的樂觀見解如下：英國退出印度的誠意旣經確定無疑，則無論印度敎徒或回敎徒必然開始發揮其固有的自衛本能。他們中間旣無外力干涉，而彼此直接碰面，自然會覺得他們有實行合作的必要。解決的方式究竟如何，雖不可預知，但大家抱有一種心理，以爲印度人的壞政府總比英國人的好政府好些。</p>
<p>英國人旣沒有金錢，更沒有軍事力量來支持印度，這是很明顯的事實。工黨覺得英國越早給與印度政治上的獨立，英國在印度保特商業上利益的機會越多。</p>
<p>倫敦泰晤士報的言論足以代表英國人的另外一種見解。這一派同樣承認英國過於軟弱，不能在印度實行其願望。他們不相信撤退計劃是解決印度當前危機的有效答案。這危機的起因，第一由於印回雙方不能在臨時政府內實行合作，第二由於草擬未來憲法的方法雙方爭持不下。此輩批評家暗示英國也許不到一九四八年便將被迫在印度國大黨與回盟兩者之間擇定一條路綫。他們　怕印回火併使整個印度中央政府宣吿解體的成脅，會造成這一個結果。</p>
<p>英國在印度還有幾件未了事項需要決定。英國是否將其治權移交於整個印度，抑移交於十一個省區，或照官方的說法，「用其他最合理，最有利於印度人民的方式移交它的治權」，依舊是一個懸而未決的問題。同時英國對於印度國君的條約關係的淸算，還延不進行。</p>
<p>大部分由印度敎徒構成的國民大會黨，顯然是印度最强大的政黨，而且該黨和好戰的錫克族也已取得一致。不管回敎徒賦有傳統的戰鬥性格，印回雙方火併的結果，印度敎徒準是佔着上風的。</p>
<p>自從魏菲爾倦勤以後，由蒙巴頓繼任印度總督。當二次世界大戰結束後尼赫魯訪問新嘉坡的盟軍總部時，蒙氏有先見之明，早已和尼氏結爲朋友，這十足顯示了他的政治家的風度。與其說蒙氏將以印督的資格行使英王代表人的特權，不如說他將以委員會主席的身份來處理印度問題。（譯自「世界報吿週刋」）</p>
<h3>邱吉爾抨擊政府　指責對巴勒斯坦政策不當</h3>
<p>〔路透社艾賽市斯郡伍特福特城廿三日電〕英國戰時首相邱吉爾今日在其選區內演說，其言有曰，英國在巴勒斯坦戰鬥不已，企圖將該地給予阿拉伯，美蘇對我國之估計及尊　心，已一落千丈，政府進重就輕，顯然已斷送廣大的印度帝國。　府在巴勒斯坦之政策，與在印度完全不同，政府不惜代價在該處從事戰鬥，兵力竟四倍於駐在印度者，吾國在巴靳斯坦力戰猶太人，以使該地成爲阿拉伯所有，而不惜全力以赴，然在印度之治理不當，已遭全世界之輕視。當余在美國時，余曾利用余之地位，以便利工黨政府之向美借款，不料成功以後，竟盜意浪費，誠不能不感覺驚與。借款之消耗於烟草及影片者，竟佔其大部份，不知借款用罄以後，吾人如何能克服我國之困難，除非再有戰爭時期。我國所表現之智力及決心，當不能克服之。邱翁繼又抨擊政府之縮短兵役期自十八個月至十二個月，邱翁最後聲明渠並無政治野心，其所以尙未退出政府活動者，乃盡其協助國家之天　耳。</p>
<h3>日衆議院改選今日舉行投票　新政府可能仍由吉田領導</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿四日專電〕日本選民明日將投票選舉四百六十六名衆院議員，是爲週來之第二次選舉。據朝日新聞稱，參加此項重要選舉之候選人，計一五七二人，人數最多者爲民主黨，計三三一人，自由黨計三二三人，社會民主黨二八二人，無黨派者二五七人共黨一二〇人。報界預測選民仍將採取選舉議負時之中道能度。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿四日電〕此間預料衆院議員之選舉中，保守派亦將得絕對大多數之勝利，故三十日後繼承吉田內閣之新閣中，左派勢力實微乎其微，新政府極可能再由吉田首相領導，而目前內閣閣員大多亦將蟬聯。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕京滬綫金陵號特快車，於前日下午二時卅分在陸家浜與崑山間之西巷小站出軌傾覆，經搶修後於當晚恢復通車，不意昨日上午九時由滬駛京之第六次頭二三等快車十六輛，於上午十時零六分，行經前日金陵號傾覆處之西巷站西分路叉道間，因該處路基新舖未穩，所掛第十一輛TP八九二號三等車廂之第二軸第一位又吿出軌，經司機發覺立即煞車，所幸當時行車速度早經减低，客貨均吿無恙。旋經路局派救援車駛往該處搶修，全綫於下午一時十分修復，一時三十分恢復通車。十二時二十分應開之第七十八次快車停駛一天。全綫交通停頓三小時餘。</p>
<p>前日下午金陵號快車在西巷站出軌傾覆後，交通部兪部長聞訊，即派路政司長　福均，機務課長王弼，迎夜來滬澈査出軌原因。昨日上午八時，由路局負責人關鐸，吳毓崑等陪同前往出事地點勘査，適該局副局長侯或華由蘇州慰問受傷乘客歸來，在西巷站相遇。昨日第六次車出軌時，侯副局長等俱曾目睹。記者昨日下午往訪侯氏，渠對於前日金陸號快車出軌傾覆原因，仍不能作肯定答復，僅謂可能由於鋼軌及枕太腐舊，不堪沉重之美式客車負荷所致。須待有關部份調査後，會商討論。關於前日受傷之乘客，重傷者名陳盤銘，現住蘇州公立醫院，頭部流血甚多，經急救後已脫險境。渠在滬割治肓腸未久，醫囑休養數日可吿無虞，重傷車童陶增榮在戚墅堰鐵路醫院救治，其餘輕傷十餘人，當經包紮出院，分別送返目的地。</p>

<h3>物價重壓下呼聲　報業等職工請解凍指數</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日物價波動劇烈，薪水階級遭受嚴重威脅。本市職工前因生活指數已由政府下令凍結，每月雖有差額金之補貼，然爲數甚微，而今物價又狂漲數倍，入不敷出，生活漸頻難於維持之境，乃醞釀要求政府解凍生活指數。此一暗潮正在逐漸擴展中。前日四區棉紡工會所屬各紗廠職工，已呈文總工會要求解凍指數，昨日中華書局又呈文總工會，報業職業工會則亦呈文社會局請求轉呈中央解凍指數，略謂：「自國防最高委員會頒佈經濟緊急措施方案，規定職工薪給，依照本年一月份之生活指數爲最高指數後，按是項辦法凍結工人生活指數，使工資不致刺激物價，物價得以穩定，以挽救工商業之危機。後又有發給差額金辦法之規定，法良意善，足見當局顧念工人生活之至意。但近日以來，物價漲風，復變本加厲，有超過數倍者，是以物價高漲之原因，當非工資所刺激無疑，影響所及，益陷工人生活於苦境。屬會前曾備丈懇請轉呈中樞恢復工人生活指數給薪辦法在案，迫不得已，特再續懇鈞長顧念事實，再呈中樞，恢復工人生活指數給薪辦法，以恤工人生活，而安社曾秩序。」</p>
<h3>綸昌紡織廠職工計薪方式生問題</h3>
<p>英商綸昌紡織廠職工之計薪方式，係由廠方自編指數以米價作根據。故政府下令凍結生活指數，補貼差額金，皆與該廠無涉。最近職工因鑒於一二月份所得工資原可買米三担，至三月份祗可買一担半，日來米價狂漲，所得史將貶値。乃呈文社會局要求（一）資方增加米兩升。（二）米指數以每担十元作爲標準基本，二三四月工資須補發工人。（三）否則即依政府規定生活指數計算，補發差額金，調整底薪，供給膳宿。</p>

<p>〔端木愷律師答〕當初立約旣已預行拋棄續租權，自難再以要求繼續租賃爲抗辯。</p>
<p>（二）重返故居</p>
<p>馬德問　敝人有住屋一幢，係先父在十年前自大房東處租得，後先父去世，全家即遷回原籍居住，此屋即分租（無契約）與各三房客，敝人近因事需遷回居住，然各房客執意不肯遷讓，不知可否限期遷出，如彼等逾期不遷，可否起訴！</p>
<p>〔端木愷律師答〕依民法第四百五十條第二項之規定，未定有期限之租賃，當事人得隨時終止契約，但依土地法第一百條各款之規定，非有各該款之情形不能收回房屋，苟現有收回自用之必要，並能提出收回自用之確切證明，可訴求法院判令遷讓收回房屋。</p>

<h3>星島今晨飛滬下午即戰漢城</h3>
<p>〔國光社香港二十四日電〕星島足球隊征滬，原定昨日啓行，因港地氣候惡劣，今日（廿四日）之中央航機機小人多，未克離港，頃決定廿五日上午九時全隊一行十八人搭乘中國航空公司四引擎大客機飛滬，中午十二時半左右，降落上海江灣機塲。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕港星島足球隊，原定前日來滬，嗣因氣候關係，未克動身，一部份則改昨日先行飛來，惟復以港天氣惡劣，仍未啓程，一行十八人再改於今日九時離港，下午抵此，並定五時起在逸園與漢城隊交鋒，門票仍售五千及八千兩種，下午二時在市體育館開始發售。</p>
<p>據足委會通吿。今日足球售票處仍假市體育館，爲防止擁擠，秩序紊亂起見，足委會商得體育館同意改善，已在該館窗口鐵絲網下面臨時挖開小口三十處，專供售票之用，屆時觀衆即在市體育館走廊窗口購票，母須進入館內，今日天氣如何，飛機能否照常飛滬及比賽是否舉行，足委會爲便利各界起見，特請上海廣播電台，於中午十二時正報吿，至時請各界收聽確切消息，電台週波爲九〇〇千週。</p>

<h3>哥倫布力克汕隊獲市長盃決賽權　女子雪白對青聯再成和局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市長盃籃球昨晚汕隊對哥倫布奪決賽權，結果哥倫布卅七比廿九勝汕隊，待與華聯爭奪錦標。女子組雪白對靑聯爭決賽權，再成卅九和局，將再作第三次賽。昨晚緊張狀態不亞於第一次時。</p>
<p>哥倫布守善於攻，長於聯防，汕隊頗難近藍，大都賴遠投得分，哥倫布愛許才能出衆，佐以大約翰勃羅齊之攻勢，相得益彰，奧勃林特林華把持籃下，汕隊甚感吃苦。汕隊昨晚表演遠不如對華聯之戰，林維聰最受觀衆歡迎，彼下半時較上半時尤佳，餘子似乎失常。</p>
<p>女子組靑聯予雪白以威脅，結果又成和局。但靑聯隊來日希望較多，且年齡較小，俱當黄金時代。昨晚靑聯前鋒殊盡力。</p>

<h3>吳市長關懷本市民食　白粳限價十七萬　配米出棧每日至少九千包</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕連日米市波動劇烈，當局甚爲關懷。吳市長於廿三日晚自杭返滬後，即於昨晨九時召見米商代表　振華，査寳三，徐頌仁，蔡聲明，胡文安，胡成鋼等談話，對米市情形　詢甚詳。代表等當聲稱現產地白粳價已達十七萬二千元，如包括運費等在上海加一萬元出售，尙無利潤可言。而社會局所拋售之米，出貨又甚爲遲緩。吳市長當表示：本市食米存底甚豐，今後即使產區粒米不來，亦足可維持。市府決每日拋售九千包食米。必　時尙可增加。過去配米出貨緩慢爲事實，自二十五日（今日）起，當規定每日至少出倉九千包，以供需要。並嚴令白粳市塲交易價不得超過十六萬元，門市零售價不得超過十七萬元。如有　越，定當嚴辦云。米商代表　　後，即於南北市塲內張貼佈吿，傳達市長意旨，漲風乃稍見緩和。</p>
<p>昨南北兩市塲共到貨一千六百六十石五斗。白粳交易絕跡，白元則升挺至二十萬五千元，陰元亦達十九萬四千元。社會局縱續拋售白粳，二號西貢及紅尖共九千包。</p>
<p>昨本廠豆汕已回小二萬，靑島吉普桶生汕則爲四十九萬五千。生油四十五萬。小車麻油五十一萬。大述杜豆則高升二萬五千，每担十六萬五千元。洋粉十萬另三千，本粉七萬五千，麩皮五萬四千。</p>
<p>豆餅銷路尙平，奈原料昂貴，再漲千餘元。黄豆突飛猛進，漲無止境，奔跳萬元以上。彔豆堅挺之狀，赤豆華南吸收頗力，續見狂漲萬元。紅糧酒坊納胃甚股，猛加七八千元。蠶豆實銷活躍，飛騰萬元。生仁求過於供，異常倘俐，洋莊高貨暴漲二三萬元，統貨劇漲二萬元，再創新高峯。苞米堅穩之極，芝蔴明定暗堅</p>
<h3>外股續漲</h3>
<p>外股昨仍受匯價繼續俏利之刺激，有進無退，午後更形火爆。證券帮雖出入頻繁，洋商及廣帮仍納。怡紗晨初四七八零零元低價起，一再步升，午後以五四五零零元高價結束。結果較前收計航業電話　植開平各升半成左右，怡紗英聯會德豐紙業怡脾各漲一成强，業廣鋼業則好起一成弱。</p>

<h3>吳市長昨招待報界　說明抑抵物價辦法　抱最大決心撲滅金紗黑市</h3>
<p>吳市長於昨日下午五時招待新聞界，報吿處置抑低物價之辦法，及政府所抱之決心。</p>
<p>（一）米　市長表示有絕對把握，可以壓至十七萬元以下，並稱產區米價，於四月一日漲起，本市於四月六日隨之上漲，當時恐有倒流現象發生，故市府未即將米拋售，至上週三，產區價格抑平，政府乃每日拋出一萬一千担，此數足够全市市民需要，且較需要量多出一千担，是時米商亦允門售米價不超過十七萬，本週一，本人在杭，接電吿已跌至十六萬五千，詎至週二又生黑市，產區與本市更因循抬價，本人獲訊，乃於前晚趕回，於今晨已與經檢處等決定，自昨日下午起，門市售價不得超過十七萬元一担，市塲交易，不得越過十六萬元，相信在短期內米商將抱觀望態度，但市府每日可拋售一萬一千担，供給全市市民需要，決不致發生恐慌，但有兩點，須注意，（甲）因產區價高，恐有倒流，現已令軍警各方，嚴加防止，（乙）難保不有小黑市發生，此點希望人民團體及新聞界作政府耳目，如有發現，立即報吿，予以嚴査，市長並希望無錫米價能平抑至十三萬元之限價，則上海門市之售價仍可回到十五萬五千元左右。</p>
<p>（二）紗　據市長估計，全市囤紗有二萬件，茲已與經檢團及紗業公會方面商討決定，凡於三月十五日以後，一個半月內所購之棉紗，必須於本月底前出棧，申請裝運出口，或售興複製廠，並已令經檢團於今日起，嚴加調査全市囤紗，其在月底前拋出，售給之對方，亦必須向政府登記，如在月底前仍延不處理者，則照其購時原價，由政府收回，逼使囤積投機者出籠，則紗價自然而然可吿下跌，至棉花來源，中央銀行正在積極設法中，當可望解決</p>
<p>（三）黄金美鈔黑市　黄金官定價格爲四百八十萬，傳黑市舊價相距頗大，但經檢團及軍警機關一再嚴査，皆未能獲此黑市交易塲所，現本人已令軍警人員化裝爲各種人物，並蕭正當商人儘量找各種路綫，向各處購買黑市黄金美鈔，如有發現，立即抓辦，依照緊急經濟措施嚴予　處，政府抱有最大決心，警必將黑市撲滅云云。</p>
<h3>柴油上漲甚烈</h3>
<p>榮油前月以各工廠配額已足，客銷　鈍，一度每噸曾低至配價，僅高出五萬至十萬元。茲受某種剌　，今市門售商每噸已喊一百十萬元。</p>
<h3>烟煤市勢轉疲</h3>
<p>烟煤進戶意呈觀望，去路漸見呆滯，然賣戶喊價仍未肯低，白煤去路活潑，趨勢極爲俏俐。</p>
<h3>遞交前途揣測紛紜　華股起伏飄忽</h3>
<p>華股昨多空肉搏，賣方在遞交前途更爲不利之傳說下，屢施壓力。但以外匯之一再緊縮，買戶仍據險頑抗，兎起鵑落，風濤險惡。散戶慘遭沒頂者甚多，於是成交大减，起伏　忽，惟遞新光與內衣同以漲停結束。</p>
<p>晨開時各股除信和微降外，均見開高，內衣且吿漲停，遞新光上塲即停。遞交永紗上塲，除多空互有掉期外，七九號一七一號一五四號一三三號八九號一九九號八四號來進，一四五號力購現永紗，遞永紗遂被哄高至四七七〇元。一三七號四號九七號一七八號一七九號一七七號一七一號脫手，退至四五二〇元。一一七號二一五號一三三號八五號四號六八號一九九號一四二號六二號六八號一四五號七六號三五號均進，盤升至四八三〇元。二三一號二二號八〇號八五號九七號一七一號二〇七號四號賣到四七〇〇元內。此時因港匯報縮，金鈔狂躍，二三一號一四二號二二四號一〇五號三一號購買，遞永紗乃漲到四八四〇元。六九號九一號四二號四號二三五號二二三號一五三號一五四號二八號一九七號九七號三六號一七七號一六〇號一九九號一四五號爭售，聞借款成功之訊，忽起慘跌，下瀉至四三三〇元。一九七號一八三號九七號八五號乘低吸納，升爲四四五〇元。一五二號一四五號四八號一二號二三五號二二三號六一號均售，人心已怯，遞永公及現遞美亞等均吿跌停，乃迫低至四一七〇元。八五號一一七號一七九號一七一號乘低補進，曾升爲四三七〇元。一四五號二二三號二四號趁高仍有了結，午收仍在四二五〇元左右徘徊。收後微升爲四三〇〇元。結果較前收計新光升半成，中法小漲，永公美亞跌停，永紗新華各降一成弱，華豐跌半成弱，景福微挫。遞交計新光漲停後小回，永紗信和微升，永公升一成强，美亞雖吿跌停，尙升半成，良以前日祗上午半天交易也。冷股內衣漲停後微降，尙升一成。新亞麗安升半成，商務微升，中絲微降，火柴跌一成弱，餘均下挫半成左右。</p>
<p>午後塲外業已喊高，受外電匯水緊縮之影響，遞永紗竟扳高至四五〇〇元。一四五號一六五號九七號逢高脫手，開後即跌至四三八〇元。一八六號一七七號二一八號二三二號一〇五號八五號一五五號一二九號來進，內衣由四三號等首先掛紅，不久永紗復回漲到四六二〇元。八五號九七號一六七號一一二號一二九號四號二號一四九號一五四號八九號四八號六九號二二四號四五號一四一號八四號一九七號之九售，並有大鈔緩發之訊，三時後，終吿盤跌至四三四〇元。一五二號一七一號一六九號八九號乘低來進，臨收拉上至四五三〇元左右。美亞仍在跌停限度成交，遞新光活動有人，更以漲停板結束。結果絞前收計新光仍有大量納戶，午前漲停後微回，午後幾迫近停限，軋漲成半弱。景福中法微升，永紗微降，信和跌半成，新華華豐跌一成弱，永公跌停後稍回，尙跌成半弱。美亞跌停。遞交計新光開收均站漲停，餘股因前日祗上午半天成交，是以頗多軋漲。美亞跌停後有回，尙升半成。永紗信和華豐永公各升一成弱迄成半不等。景福軋高二成，冷股內衣漲停，水泥平平，中紡統益跌一成右零，餘股成交寥落，除麗安升半成外，餘自微降迄半成不等。塲外各股計大生微升，餘均微挫</p>
<p>套利交易銀行觀望</p>
<p>現遞套利交易，永紗掉期自一四〇元起，步高至二二元。銀行帮貼進胃口較呆，良以底碼增加，且遞交前途不利成份加重，似有預防措置。聞某大商業銀行，即有半數籌碼未轉期，以致多方若八九號等，紛求貼出，形成粥少僧多，今日息自一角一分起迄二角弱不等。餘股若信和美亞等，金融帮亦貼進不多，約合月息一角七八分不等。銀根吿緊之象，一反以前數期情形。</p>
<p>紅日新光光芒四射</p>
<p>昨日「遞交新光」初次登塲，鋒芒畢露。晨開由一六三，二〇四掛一四六元半買進，首吿漲停。中途因散戶獲利吐售，市價稍回，午收一三五元，「白光」一三〇元。後收初開，人心振奮，新多加入猛吸，金融帮力進，收市再見漲停板，盛傳有大戶組織多頭公司，拉抬「新光」，初步目標爲二百元云。</p>

<h3>美滙黑市猖獗出口貿易停頓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據出口方面消息：日來黑市美匯猖獗，此於出口商經營前途，殊屬不利。持有出口物資之商人，大多持貨不售。故日來出口物資之成交，已屬絕無僅有，惟價格尙稱平穩。聞普通陽衣，每桶價在六百萬元以上。桐汕每担，合四十一萬元。上海猪鬃，每担合二百六十萬元。價有好起一成至二成者，惟大部均無變動，尙未有因國行發行大劵而劇漲之事。且依目前各種出口物資之國內市價言仍多與國外市價發生倒掛現象。例如桐油一項，以國內市價言，約合美金三角五分一磅。而桐油在美之市價，每磅不過美金三角。他如大黄倍子等，按目前國內市價言，均無法發動外銷。目前我國出口貿易，除中央信託局及中國植物油廠有若千桐油物資輸出外，商人方面之出口貿易，幾全部陷於停頓狀態中。自對美匯率調整爲一萬二千元後，出口貿易，亦僅在調整匯率後半個月至一個月之期間，曾略呈起色。惟好景不常，旋即因出口物資之步漲，及黑市美匯之趨昂，將出口貿易之有利趨勢，全盤打散。爲今之圖，一方面除希望國內物價趨平，及消滅黑市美匯外，同時望國外市塲價格，能稍提高，則我國出口貿易，方有復蘇之望云。</p>

<h3>醫學上的報紙文章與雜誌文章</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>寫文章，是一件難工作，一樁苦事情，寫醫學上的文章，更是一件難工作苦事體了。普通的文章，可以寫些空話，說些廢語，醫學却因爲是一種科學，只能憑着實實在在的事實講實話，有一句說一句，少寫了，固然會感到文義的不能明白，多寫了，又會感覺到文字的過於冗長。這不像別的文章，尤其是文藝一類的文字，同樣的一篇文章，可隨着寫作者的筆頭與技巧而轉移：可長可短，能伸能縮。</p>
<p>醫學上的文字，大槪可以分成這麽二大類：一種是專門對於一般民衆說話而寫的通俗文章；還有一種呢，是供醫界本身用以研究或討論的述作文章。我現在暫且把第一類的通俗文字，定牠一個名頭，呌：「報紙文章」；另一種給醫界自身用以研究或討論而寫的述作文章，我也把牠定出一個「雜誌文章」的名目。</p>
<p>「報紙文章」與「雜誌文章」這二個名目，要實質的講起來，是不十分妥當的。因爲也有許多的醫學雜誌是專門供給一般民衆閱讀的，中間文字，都刋載些普通常識的文字；可是我定這二個名目，只不過就大體地來作一個假定的名詞罷了。大體說來，看報紙的人，總比看雜誌的人多，報紙的閱者，也是以一般民衆來得多。醫學雜誌呢，雖然也有些是特地爲民衆而寫作的，但總不及報紙上的文字之易於普遍，易於引起民衆注意吧。</p>
<p>報紙文章與雜誌文章兩者，究有什麼分別呢？上面曾經說起過：一種是對於民衆而寫作的通俗文字，）種是醫界自身用以研究，討論及報吿等等的述作文字。換句話講：對於民衆說話的通俗文字，寫作者雖然是醫界中的科學人才，而閱讀者，却多數是一般非醫界的民衆。而雜誌文章呢，寫作者，固然是醫界自己的人們，閱讀者呢，也還是醫界自身的一班人。</p>
<p>因爲報紙文章與雜誌兩者的本質，旣有這樣的不同，那麼置身於醫界，而嘗抽暇寫作醫學文章的醫者，在寫作醫學文字時，便有注意到寫作時的技巧問題的必要了。</p>
<p>寫作供給醫界自身閱讀的雜誌文章，只要憑着自家研究的心得，或事實的實情，或理論的意見，精確的直寫出來就是了。舉凡文字中間所有醫學上的術語或專門的名詞，都可照直的信手寫下，決計再用不着解釋的工作；因爲看文章的人，旣都是醫界的內行人，這些所有的醫學專門用語，科學名詞，個個人都能瞭解，都會明白；如再用文字去詳加解釋，倒反成了畫蛇添足。反之，要是寫的是爲一般民衆閱讀的報紙文章，那就不能不注意一下閱讀者——一般民衆們的口胃了。兒意與成人的飲食物是不能一樣的，因爲他們的胃腸，對於飲食物的消化力和吸收力，各有强弱的不同。同樣地，一般素常缺乏醫學常識的民衆與置身醫界的內行人，對於這醫學文字的理解力，不消說得，亦自然各各不同。譬如寫作供給醫界中人看的雜誌文章，無論醫學上的專門術語，科學各詞，都可隨思所欲的信手寫下，不必再加解釋，而寫作給一般缺乏醫學常識的民衆看的報紙文章，對於這些醫學上的專門名詞，固定術語，便必須費一番解釋的工作，詳加解釋之後，方能使讀者們明瞭其中的含義呢。尙未長出乳齒的嬰兒，是咀嚼不了香甜堅實的良鄉栗子的。不然的話，在寫作固然白費了工夫，空耗了心思，讀者們却仍然咀嚼不出文字當中的味兒來。</p>
<p>舉出幾個例子：「預後」這不是我們在寫作醫學文章時，時常引用得着的一個專門名詞嗎？這一個醫學上最普通最淺顯的專門名詞，在醫界中人看來，那當然是亳不費力的瞭然於牠的含義，明白牠的意思，就是我們根據疾病的「種類」和「性質」與病人病勢的「程度」，和病者向來的「體質」，以及目下醫學上治療的「效能」等等，來預測這一個疾病後來結果的或好或壞。如其在一般缺乏醫學常識的大衆看了，便十九是不會瞭解這一個名詞中的含義的。又如治療學上不是有種「待期療法」的術語嗎？這個「待期療法」，在寫作醫學文章時，也是很普遍的應用的。這個慣用的術語，在醫界中人一看，誰都很容易明白，很容易瞭解，知道這個「待期療法」的意義，就是；遇着一種還沒有根本療法的疾病，惟有在這一種疾病的一定經過的期間中，設法維持病者體力，使他易於忍受此病所發生的種種症候，普防止其異常經過，和他種「合併症」的發生，而靜待這一個疾病經過的完結，那末這一個疾病，往往可以獲得「自然治愈」的良好效果。這個「待期療法」的術語，若在一般素乏醫學常識的大衆們看了，要不加詳細的解釋，如何會瞭解這裏頭的含義呢？—當然啦，這種例子，是所見都是，舉不勝舉的。</p>
<p>對於寫作報紙文章，除了對於這種醫學上的專門術語，專門名詞，應加留心而外，尙須注意到文字的本身上。文字的本身，必須要淺顯通俗，要淸楚生勁。這個，本來寫作一切的科學文字，都應如此，不過醫學上的文章，尤其是寫給一般大衆看的報紙文章，更應如此。淺顯通俗的文字，才會普遍，淸楚才易於理解，生勁才能使讀者發生出興趣。所以這些，都是在寫作醫學上的報紙文章時，所必須注意的重要條件。</p>
<p>「語體文」是比「文言文」來得淺顯通俗，而且容易寫得淸楚。至於生勁呢，在善於運用語體文字寫作的人，往往便能寫得非常生動，十分有力，所以對於醫學上的文章，尤其是醫學上的報紙文章，我覺得應該多多採用語體文寫作爲上。然在不善寫作語體文字的人，寫作起來，寫是寫出整大篇，讀者看了，非但不覺得他的「淺顯」和「淸楚」等等的優點，恐怕反會感覺得咕嚕了大篇，却仍不知其中說的什麽；只覺得他嚕囌冗長，未見其生動有勁。所以寫作淺顯的通俗文字，亦非易事！倒底還要在寫作者的技巧才分，寫作者的得心應手哩。</p>
<h3>注意口腔衛生</h3>
<p>— 汪公復</p>
<p>吾人之牙齒乃胃之門戶，而口腔則爲食氣兩管之總樞，往來因而繁雜，不免引起了細菌的覬覦而繁殖在口中。有以人之口是潔凈論：實大大的錯誤；孰知口腔旣掌握着進出口的大權，因之，亦爲細菌侵入之一良好門戶，尤以齒垢，齲齒　間等處，均不知有幾何細菌寄跡着。口內之細菌數實較身體各組織任何一部份爲夥，關於口腔內所繁殖的菌類其形狀及種類極衆，依其外形而論，約可分爲球狀，桿狀，及螺旋狀三種；因口腔內可停留之細菌包括有任何種類所以其固有的亦可分成七類；（一）口腔巨大桿菌：生存於不潔之口腔內，（二）紡　狀桿菌：常見於齒槽膿　，　瘍性口內炎以及常人之口內，（三）涎液螺旋狀菌：常能見於口腔涎液，尤以齒齦爲衆，（四）葡萄狀長菌：常寄跡於不潔齒齦齒垢，（五）口腔分岐狀菌：能見於齒齦炎及齒糟膿漏，（六）有鞘碘球菌：最多在齒垢內發現，（七）齒牙螺旋狀菌：以齒齦爲最多發見處。更因口腔內常有各種有機及無機的物質存着，故對於細菌生活實爲一最妥善之天然營養所，加以口內適量的溫度光綫，動靜均合於其發育時之方針，氧氣，炭鹽類，水分等亦合乎其生存之原素（其中尤以水份爲最不可缺少的養料），所以在口內的細菌繁殖丈極强，因細菌又名分裂菌，藉分裂而繁殖，一如球狀菌分裂時先成爲橢圓形，次於中央横裂而成爲二幼菌；桿狀菌則在其長度中伸長，然後一裂爲二，如此一而二，二而四，四而八，終而增殖至無數。</p>
<p>爲要避免細菌繁殖或殺害起見，往往有人以爲替用某種烈性，液體嗽洗以驅除之，其實這情形也屬荒謬（根本不能根絕）假若要减少在口內的細菌繁殖，則需充分掃除齒窩內積沉之齒石（堆積在齒外頸部一種堅硬之物質謂齒石）故此項工作必需由牙醫師擔任。美國萊德氏及史密斯兩氏曾說：「欲保爾的齒牙健全，需於每月內由牙醫師擔任淸掃工作二次」但照實際情形而論，吾人能於一年內實施二三次則已足矣。</p>
<p>口腔淸潔當不容忽視，尤以幼孩在乳牙出齦後，即需注意其口腔齒牙淸潔並應常用手指裏以消毒棉花蘸三％硼砂水揩拭之；一俟恒牙出全屆時須陪同至牙醫師處診査，是否有患牙，若有當早治，以免蔓延至附近齒牙。同時對於刷牙也須注重，並應督促使其能完善做到。吾人亦然，每每對於刷牙方法，槪多忽略，而不瞭解，每有刷牙僅刷外表而不刷內側者或僅顧左右横刷者，均屬錯誤，故刷牙必時先擇一較小而刷毛稍硬略帶彎曲形之牙刷而刷時應作輪狀之動作，由上而下，齒牙左，右，內，外，均需逐一刷到一日三次而尤重於晚間一次，因食物殘層停留在口腔內過夜能形成發酵現像以及細菌之繁殖能使齒面琺瑯質受損。假若一旦齒牙不健全咀嚼機能薄弱而食物消化全頓胃陽，易引起胃腸疾病致全身失却健康。曾有人作一統計曰：「每一次正作刷牙能驅除口腔內細菌三分之一」「刷牙」誠自身除菌之唯一良法。</p>
<p>以上一點，謹貢獻給諸位讀者，並奉勸爲父母者留意下一代的主人翁及自己本身的幸福。</p>
<h3>葡萄糖酸鈣</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>拜讀本刋第四期宋國賓大醫師的大作「葡萄糖鈣與丙種維生素合併注射之檢討」後，令人懷疑之至。葡萄糖酸鈣與丙種維生素同用原屬合理，滬上大多數的醫師都這探使用。因肺癆消耗丙種維生素過份，所以必須儘量爲之補足，這是衆所週知的；否則口乾舌燥，皮膚枯燥必加速其死亡！遇到這種病人，注射五百國際單位還　不够，須五千至一萬單位也是衆所週知　。宋醫師咬定牠學名有個「酸」字，而　　酸橘子製成，就根據「酸性物質有溶　露質之可能」的一點，以爲維他命C就能使鈣質失其作用，試問病人自體中原有的維他命C，也會使鈣質失其作用嗎！所以宋醫師的高見未敢贊同，此其一？</p>
<p>宋醫師以爲「織維型的肺癆病者體中鈣質已達飽和程度，鈣質注射未必有益」，以此類推，鈣針能注射到飽和程度，不是病人將成石靑模型了嗎？鈣針中石灰質試問有多少分量？誰不知鈣針注入後大郁分會流出（排出體外）的，所以一定要勸病者同時吃魚肝油，借了丁種維他命之力，才能使鈣質沉着，此其二。</p>
<p>至老年患者，宋醫師以爲「再注射鈣劑將使血管硬化愈益加甚」這一點有否事實，可資佐證？亦極懷疑。即使如此也無異因噎廢食。凡屬肺癆病人，無分男女老幼，現在用「葡萄糖酸鈣」療治，尙不算落伍，有時且持續二三年亦未見有何流弊，血管硬化不硬化似屬次要問題，因肺癆不合理治療，死亡之速，比血管硬化還要可怕，此其三。</p>
<p>總之，未經動物試騐，證明「維他命C確能使釫質失其作用」，則葡萄糖酸鈣與丙種維生素的矛盾說，似難定論。</p>
<p>編者按：沈松年君一文對於宋國賓君上期「葡萄糖鈣不宜與維他命C一同注射」之主張有所論列，確有見地，惟葡萄糖鈣與維他命C裝於同一之注射器內尙時注入病者靜脈內是否有碍，則尙有待於專家之檢討，蓋人身本體對於酸質及鈣質之控制與調度自有其「特有」之功能，吾人不能妄加臆測，而鈣質與酸性在未注入靜脈之前已混合於同一之注射器內有無起化學作用，則有待於藥學專家之檢討者他。惟仁者見仁，智者見智，香人不作左右袒，二者姑妄存之，可也。</p>
<h3>新中醫之謎（四）</h3>
<p>— 洪貫之</p>
<p>此外還有向來用爲辨症根據的「寒熱虛實表裏」的幾個大綱，是屬於簡單的常識之一部，也並不含有什麼高深的哲理，雖然儘有暗合科學之處，然而總是一種不明原理的知識，還是算不得一種學問基礎，這是毫無疑問的。現在我在這裏，再重複一句，就是主觀經騐的說法，也要在多數人共同觀點上，一致承認而無異議的，才可以呌牠經驗，所以中醫並不是「經騐的」產物，決不能任意附會的。至於客觀的經騐，更非中醫所能妄用以自誇，那更不必多說了！讀者如果能把中醫理論和應用上所有的矛盾，平心靜氣的仔細尋求一番，再看中醫所說的經騐，究竟是怎麽一回事？他們所經騐的「現象」，是否「事實」，能否切中物體，說到「本質」上去，把牠詳爲分析一下，對於「中醫究竟是什麼？」這個問題，大致也就可以解答了！</p>
<p>（三）爲科學化進一解</p>
<p>中醫的理論是「玄說」，臨證方面是靠着一部份簡單的常識，不是眞正的「經騐」，更不能稱之爲學問，不是「科學的」，當然也不必說了。然而到現在還有人不明白「科學」是什麼？眞是可怪之至，竟會說出「中醫不要西醫化，應該科學化」的話來，而且這篇妙文，也在上年十二月中發表，試與陸君之文對比，可謂相映成趣。該文作者，是現在浙江省黨部服務的一位中醫師牟允方光生，他反對「等於西醫用中藥」的科學化方法，而主張所謂「自動的化西」，一望而知是一個「中體西用」論者，我看了這段妙論，不禁打了一個寒噤，（不是白日見鬼，請讀者勿誤會。）「中體西用」式的這種幻想，早在二十年前就有很多的人嘗試過了，而且毫無保留餘地的失敗了，我看牟君迎歷史演進的常識都沒有，所以會來提倡開倒車。據他的意思，「中醫學」似乎是可以長存於世界，而與「西醫」永久對立的。不過也需要改良改良罷了，他的所謂「科學化」，說得很含糊，大槪就是想個法子，把中醫成爲獨立的一種學科的意思，那麽如何配稱「科學化」之尊號呢？這裏使我不得不把醫學的性質，和科學的定義，也簡單的來說幾句，因爲人是形而下的「高等動物」，（形而下者謂之器，器就是有形質的物。不是遊魂。）醫學是硏究人類的生理和疾病處理一種學問，所以是「科學的」產牧，不是「形面上的哲學，」而且這裏所說的科學，及指「狹義的科學」，與哲學相對待，即「自然科學」之簡稱；換言之，即應用各種自然科學的方法，如生物數理化學……等，以爲硏究的，即是科學的醫學。（也是普通所謂西醫學）牟君以爲「東西文化的根本思想，完全不同，所以中西餞學的知誧，亦殊途，歐洲自始就有物的觀念，一切都認爲物的實在。」這種說法，完全是把歷史抹煞了的說話。我不說別的，就說醫學，西醫學的前身，也是同中醫一樣在「玄說中」成長的，一樣經過空想的過程，他們從前也有地·水·風·火·四行的醫論，可是因爲近百年來，自然科學各方面的進步，所以醫學也就走上了科學的大道，成爲一稱新穎獨立的科學了。從哲學思想或性情習慣上說，東西文化，自有其相異之處，但是醫學是「物質」的，不是「精神」的，根本上就無「東西」文化的可分。（待續）</p>
<h3>爲醫藥問答問題告讀者</h3>
<p>— 梁俊</p>
<p>在本刋第一期內我曾經指出服務於醫藥問答的困難，並且承認從前在其他刋物上對於此種工作的失敗。我曾經有過一種希望，想把許多類似的問題彙集在一起而加以詳細的總答覆，同時便把許多不必要的而且不合於情理的問條删去，這樣不但有益於大多數的讀者而且也可以减少編奢的麻煩。可是，因爲本刋是輪流編輯者的，各人有各人的主張，各人有各人的作風，我這種卞張就因此而不克實行。</p>
<p>近來，本刋編輯部接着許多讀者的來稿，批評這種醫藥問答的不切實際，「旣不能使詢問者在短期內得着答覆，又不能使其他的讀者知所借鏡有所裨益，結果或則不免失之浮泛或則不免有推銷藥物之嫌。」上月在天津大公報醫學週刋內猷先君的「醫藥問答評」一文內更露骨地批評各報醫藥副刋內所載醫藥問答的缺點。這眞是要使我們編輯者大大的覺醒的了。</p>
<p>本來，我們對於醫藥問題的工作是抱着犧牲精神去做的，決計不是天津大公報所說的「一般庸醫因營業蕭條而弄些醫藥問答，條條註上自己的大名去招徠顧主」。那一種意思。然而結果竟有這樣的輿論，當然非我們始料所及。爲今之計，我們檢討過去，策勉將來，自然有改變方式的必要。因此，我們特地吿訴讀者，從今以後凡是太簡單，太無系統叙述的醫藥問題，恕我們不再答覆。反之，假使有一位病者，能够詳細叙述他自己的病歷，和自己的視察以及中西醫診治的經過情形，那末我們一定會給予解答的。</p>
<p>有些人以爲醫藥問答是非科學的，不應該有在的。這是閉着眼睛說大話的狂妄者。假使他讀過歐美各國的醫藥雜誌或醫藥副刋，那末他一定會曉得不應該這樣的閉着眼睛說話了。</p>
<p>好，廢話不多說，但願我們的犧牲工作對於讀者有所貢獻！</p>

<h3>夏威夷的雙重懺悔</h3>
<p>— 法蓋塞爾作　青譯</p>
<p>喉管像是燙傷了的肌肉，她又對丈夫再要了一杯淸水。亞朗因爲她那陣衰弱聲音不免有一些兒毫毛倒豎了。</p>
<p>她正躺在一張敝得很開的窗子跟前。種種被一片發香的和快樂的土地所滋養而包涵芬芳脂肪的微風，用呼吸充滿了他們這所臨時木屋。牠們帶來了巨人型的廬薈的苦香，香蕉林的酸味，和海面的自然香氣。太陽剛剛在這海島的頂上升起來。一陣玫瑰色的海泡，更洗淡了無數波浪的染上紫色的蔚藍味兒，有時，在這些波浪之中，一道更强烈的日光像一條金蛇似地奔竄。</p>
<p>「請您聽喲……」那靑年婦人喃喃地說。</p>
<p>這時候，很近或者很遠——這都是無法知道的——有一陣由古代的器樂和淸妙的聲樂相伴而僅僅可以辨別的歌聲傳過來。</p>
<p>「夏威夷的吉他，綺蒂德」亞朗這樣回復。「這些聲音教您不自在嗎？我就派用人攆走這些唱歌的人罷。」</p>
<p>「不丹，我央求您，請您隨他們唱罷。他們對我是有益的。」</p>
<p>因爲自己在這種央求裏邊兒所用的突進態度而力竭了，綺蒂德輕輕把腦袋偏到一邊兒。她那雙本來摺在胸部上的臂搏，也用軟弱的姿勢散開來。經過這一夜的冷酷光陰，使她感到全身不過是破碎的創傷和烈火，現在照着黎明的稀薄光明，竟用肉感的愉快來欣賞了。</p>
<p>在半開半闔的眼臉之下，她的目光對著那座滿是罕見的花和儼如哨兵的驕人棕欄的大園子汎汎地望了一陣。再遠些兒，在各處的稻田里，無數棕色的漢子已經向着各處的溝渠彎着腰……</p>
<p>末了，這靑年婦人的那顆本在困難之中工作的心房，現在更跳得沉重了。</p>
<p>這一切，蓬勃的樹木，花畦，滿是光明蕃殖和富源田野，整個兒是亞朋的作品和地盤。沒有一點不是屬於他的，連那些珊瑚色的礁石，剛才敎太平洋的波浪遇着就折破的珊瑚礁都包括在內，沒有一點甚麼不掛着表示他的勢力和意志的標識。</p>
<p>以前多少次數靠着這座光綫充足的窗子邊兒，綺蒂德，對着這幅遠景，早已感到了一陣標緲的恐　鑽進了她的心里。她的和人世的隔離究竟是甚麼樣的，自己住在這些荒野而肥沃的土地中央，丈夫是這些土地的唯一主宰，無數的目光烱烱的野蠻人通通彎起脊梁封着這些土地？</p>
<p>慢慢地，她帶着一種幽暗的畏懼瞧着他。他俯着腦袋坐在她的身邊兒，綺蒂德只望見他那些挺硬的灰白頭髮，他那條很壯健又很灰黑的後頸窩兒。但是他身上的一切，都是生來那樣規則和停勻的，所以她這時相信看見了他的臉兒：方額頭，鷹嘴鼻子，緊閉而綫條强硬的嘴巴，尖的下頦。</p>
<p>「我能彀給您做點兒甚麼，心肝？」他低聲問。</p>
<p>「醫生終於就會來嗎？」</p>
<p>「城裏離這兒是不近的，而阿陳一直到天將明的時候才去請他。」</p>
<p>在這靑年婦人的心裏，覺得有一陣異樣的勝利微光在她丈夫的眼裏閃過。於是那種時常在這個强硬的面具前面發散的害怕，竟敎她發抖了，比起她身上的高溫本身更强和更有鑽透力。</p>
<p>恰像他猜着了道種苦惱，就抬起自己那幾隻長而縐的指頭兒擱在綺蒂德的額頭上，接着就撫摸起來。開始在這接觸之下着慌的她，漸漸歸於寗靜了。她以前恐懼是枉費了的。亞朗愛她。粗魯地愛着大槪，並且笨手笨脚地愛着不過這愛情知像是一爐激烈而深奧得難於認識的火。她早已看見他對她種種欲望是留心的，在他的擁抱之中每每因爲喜悅而渾身發抖。昨天整整的一夜，他不是用了一種忍耐而溫柔的殷動給她看護嗎？旣然他是屬於她的，而且能彀以一種啓示去破壞他的生活者也就是她，那末何必害怕他呢？</p>
<p>那種使她這少壯身體萎靡的衰弱現象，鬆懈了她對於亞朗的厭忌，感動了她的心靈。於是一陣悔悟在她的心上甦醒了，立刻又驅散了，似是這悔悟却引起了欲望，要用多量的寬大去省識這個已經不爲她所愛的臉兒。</p>
<p>她坦白地旋轉頭來對着他了，他本來沒有預料這個迅速的動作；於是她並出了一道輕輕的呌喚。</p>
<p>因爲，在這些素來不受撓屈的臉上綫條上，她看明白了一種那樣深沈的悲歎和一種那樣傷感的柔情，於是她得着一個駭人的確實事情了：死神已經在這裏了，在這間空曠的屋子裏了，在這些輕便的家具上面了，而她丈夫早已見了死神的脚步兒了。</p>
<p>許多美觀得像是紫銅的人類皮膚，正在比剛才較爲灼人的太陽下面發光了。海風送了些較爲豐富較人混雜的芬芳過來了，而太平洋的洋面不過是一大片灼人的靑玉了。</p>
<p>從來沒有一種比這個定數的時刻更爲獰惡的孤獨繞過綺蒂德的四週。在無可奈何之下，她眞有緊緊貼身箍住這個近在咫尺的唯一男子的必要了。但是爲著使這塲最後的領聖體儀式能　是甘美的和有救助的，那末就應當對他通盤說出來：</p>
<p>「亞朗！」她用一道己發喘涸的聲音喃喃地說。「我不願意沒有得到您的寬恕就帶走一件太嚴重的秘密。」</p>
<p>她停住了，重新吸了一口氣才繼續說道：</p>
<p>「我對像已經不是忠實的了……三天以前，開走一條英國大兵艦。那上面有一個標識……」</p>
<p>到了氣力的盡頭，她默然了。亞朗對她端詳，她臉色慘白了；他用平靜的聲音向她說道：</p>
<p>「我也一樣，我需要寬恕，綺蒂德。我全都知道。因此我昨天對您用了夏威夷藥人的毒藥。（原文見法文「中國郵便」週刋第六期作J.Kessel）</p>
<h3>丁亥春江南重逢梅九</h3>
<p>— 立卿</p>
<p>公將以國風移植於海上</p>
<p>避秦瀕海久亡家，忽見老梅又着花；亟問「國風」無恙否？當仁不讓發雄葩。</p>
<p>「國風」「晋乘」後先雄，不啻河山帶礪功；今日老梅猶傲岸，新華寂寞宮花紅。</p>
<p>和張立卿老同志見贈兩絕原韵　老梅</p>
<p>亡命册年不顧家，摩挲老眼尙無花；頌聲久寖勳勞　，「詩史」一篇是正葩。</p>
<p>飄泊天涯意氣雄，獻身革命恥言功；最憐九域重光後，禍起蕭牆戰血紅！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血404</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「我有一個絕對嚴秘的密碼方式—無機中滲和有機的變化，並且簡單易學。」</p>
<p>「給我瞧瞧那個底本。」守一伸出手來討了。</p>
<p>「不行；」鶴見雙手一拍，「身邊沒有帶着；我全靠記憶。…沒關係，反正正岩在這裏，他有密碼底本，也知道運用有機方式…」</p>
<p>「很好。」守一把伸出的撤回，「但這祗能解決合作技術的一方面，傳遞消息，—當然是極重要的一方面。其他還有交通的，人事的，戰鬥工具的，符記的，語言的…」</p>
<p>「我想」，鶴見的思潮，受了波動，也沽發起來，生恐把想起的事，岔了過去，來不及似的，切斷了守一的話；一旣是你們的余君和我們的岳大哥熟識，我們就設法讓這二位聚會一次，把這些技術上的問題，磋商一個具體的解決，讓我們之間，一切「統一化」，…可惜，」鶴見又把雙掌一拍，好像丟掉了一封重要文件似的。</p>
<p>「又想起了什麼？」守一看見鶴見那種抓耳搔腮，思渤奔騰的樣子，知道他這時有些興奮過度。</p>
<p>「可恨沒有辦法，把我們那邊幾位好手，都搬到你們這裏來，讓他們在一起，聚會一個時期，哪怕短短一個時期，讓大家把現有的思想，學問，技術，一齊融會貫通一遭，那，該是多們美的一件事。…</p>
<p>「頭一位是我們的紀耀羣—一位二十二三歲的小姐；她的聰明和技能，眞是一等第一—當然指着我現在認識的人說—還有一位小老虎，名呌蕭虎城，你猜他有多大？…才十二歲哪—中國武術，也是一等第一；　，像我這們大的個子，他輕輕這們一撥弄，我就得爬下。那還是客氣的。我們的岳大哥，親眼看見他輕輕兩下，就把兩個日本軍官，送回了老家。」鶴見邊說邊表演着。</p>
<p>「那是達摩掌一類的重手；他練的是那一門？」守一也引起了興味。</p>
<p>「可憐哪，我哪裏懂得這些？…剛才我說的「好奇問題，』就是指的這些事，如非岳大哥說的那們眞切，我簡直不敢相信，你看？…」</p>
<p>「敝莊就有人練過這一套；」守一微微笑着。</p>
<p>「直的？」那麽聰明的鶴見，這時變成了一個優瓜似的。</p>
<p>「信不信由你！」守一仍舊微笑着。—中國之大加上數千年的文華薈萃，可又不斷地遭了多少朝代魔王的屈壓，許多奇才異秉的人物，專心致意，該能造成多少神秘的效果出來！這一點點武技，算得了什麽？……也就是一直被一代一代的魔王屈壓着，不霄讓這些人物，抓住喘氣的機會，配合時代，連帶向物質文明，……向科學上進展，所以才弄成這般糟的現象……」</p>
<h3>爲「廢除美育」而呐喊</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>昨閱各報，發現敎育部中學課程標準修訂委員會將廢除中學美術科改以「實用技藝」代之，使我頓時感到莫名的悲哀，爲靑年，爲民族文化，爲國家前途而悲哀！</p>
<p>因此，不得不略陳臆見，至誠地希望敎育當局及早收回成命，勿令外人恥笑。</p>
<p>關於一般美育問題，早在二十年前，已有蔡元培先生再三再四的提倡，而且爲我們解釋得够淸晰了。甚至於蔡先生主張「以美術代宗敎」，想來多數不鍵忘的朋友們都還記得罷！</p>
<p>抗戰這久，物質生活的貧乏與困苦，已臨到大多數人的頭上是事實，這時再來高唱「美育」，乎是不合潮流的事，其實不然。</p>
<p>當憲法成立的那天，我們不是也看見明文規定的要「提倡藝術」嗎？因而我們曾稍展愁眉，詎料政府改組後的今日，堂堂敎部不但違背憲章，竟繼上海市參議會「撤銷藝術師範」的議案，索性擬將全國中等學校的「美術」課一律廢除，這樣的敎育方針，是效學那一强國？着實令人大惑不解！</p>
<p>抗戰雖說是勝利了，但我們八年來的堅苦，換得些什麼？</p>
<p>生活物資缺乏，人心悽凉可怖，宗敎道德毁滅，社會秩序紊亂，貪汚奸匪猖獗……。</p>
<p>長此以往，國運如何能振？人民何以爲生？</p>
<p>人類與其他動物之不同，就是一爲憑智慧支配生活，一爲賴本能爭取生活；人之所以分爲文明與野蠻，亦復如是。前者是受適人格的陶冶而能發揚智慧，後者則未能擺脫其本能的支配，無由向上，因而相形之下，顯得醜惡，蠢愚，粗野，下流。</p>
<p>試觀世界各國，强與弱是怎樣分的？統治者與被壓迫者又是怎樣形成的？我從未聞一個强國沒有文化，也沒有看見一個强國自己削弱或摧殘本國的文化，倘若有，那就是中國。</p>
<p>美術是文化的重要的一環。摧殘美術無異摧幾文化，挑殘文化亦即摧猶國家。</p>
<p>何况在一切物質文明遠不及西歐，國民生活已到極端困苦的當前中國，照理應該改善人心，配給精神食糧，使一般陷於貧困痛苦的人，不僞貧困痛苦而屈服，不使瀕於絕望；未陷於貧困痛苦的人，不墮於游惰，不趨於奢侈。易言之；經過美育的陶冶的人，他的精神是永遠愉快的，性情是高尙的，靈魂是純潔的；無論他是屬於那一階層，他都有一個壺中的天地；無論在任何時候，處於任何境遇都不會爲之左右，迷惑。永遠永遠地保持着寗靜，滋潤，靑春，希望和光明。這就是說；他經過了美的陶冶而獲得了精神的審託。</p>
<p>反之，不給他以精神食糧，使之心理健康，勢必窮追物質的享受。痛苦的愈痛苦，不該屈服的屈服（漢奸就是個例），絕望的自殺，遊惰的率性愈趨奢侈，浮華，淫蕩。但是究其精神仍然是痛苦，性情必定乖張，祇有臭的軀売，而無眞的靈魂。於是變節，迷惑，不安，枯寂，失望，黑暗……都一層層籠罩的着他。小而言之，使他變成一架製造大糞的機器，一個活屍。大言之，貪官汚吏，漢奸賣國賊都是這樣——祗重物質的敎育敎成功的。</p>
<p>所以，我敢武斷地說：要使人類心理健康，使世界得到眞正的和平，除去努力精神建設之外是再沒有第二條路的。一個偉大的敎育家應該急不容緩的負起這個偉大的使命。而况我們不是一個野心的軍國主養的國家，我們不需要把敎育當作戰爭的工具。</p>
<p>再說：中華敎育的目的是在求中學時代獲得一切學科應有的普通常識：任何一國的中學敎育，都可借鏡——就是唯物主義的蘇聯，亦未　廢除中學校的美術敎育，我亂何能進步至如此哉？</p>
<p>我這樣的高聲吶喊，目的到並非爲了本身或代替同道的伙伴謀出路，討飯吃；也並不痴望每一個中學生都走入芝蘭之室，而是惟恐外人來到中國有如踏進了鮑魚之肆，皆掩鼻而過喲。</p>
<p>退幾十步來說：故中學美術課爲所謂「實用技藝」（按係報兼敎部議案），亦即如呂鳳子先生的駁復敎部函稱：……『實用技藝，至少應包括製作實用而適用之器物而言，製作適用器物，焉能不先製圖？又焉能不求備美的形式？是即捨美術本課功能弗論，但就敎學實用技藝說，亦不能無賴美術……」</p>
<p>在一個深有脩養的呂先生尙且如是言，但不知敎部該案提議人曾如是想過否？更不知又將何以答？我們很有興趣的期待着。（四，二三，于寗泊樓）</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>兩個舞台</h3>
<p>— 鳴濤</p>
<p>有人說，演戲的是瘋子看戲的是　子。因爲前者是把假戲當眞做，忽哭忽笑的，活像神經失常；而後者是把假戲當眞看，「英名其妙」，優里瓜氣的也跟着演員哭哭笑笑。在本質上說起來，他們都是同樣的視假爲眞，所以超然物外的「哲人」，也就把他們判爲一瘋一便。</p>
<p>觀衆只有在劇塲裏，進入到舞台上的幻境以後，他們才逐漸的隱匿了自己的理智，忘記了自己所置身的環境，一步一脚的遠離了聰明和智慧，被戲劇效果攪　了起來．也只有在這種時候，他們才願意自我愚弄的假戲眞看，甚至陪上一把鼻涕一把淚，恰如他們在人生現實裏面臨到悲苦歡樂一樣。可是在走出劇塲以後，他們就絕對不肯承認那剛才感動他的戲劇情節是「人生」了。他們的理由很對：「說到底，這究竟是齣戲呀。」而這種戲後淸醒的觀衆，竟仍不免被人目爲「傻子」，和我們後面將要說起的那種觀衆比起來，可眞是太不公平了。</p>
<p>某報載：當局鑒於近來上海市之平劇話劇，其劇情大多以諷刺·暴露·窮困現實爲主題，足以動搖社會人心。已咨請上海市政府，予以取締。</p>
<p>沒想到，在我們國家裏，還有這麽一批「忠實」於戲劇的觀衆，即使當他們走出劇塲，甚至還可能在當頭一盆冷水淋下，完全冷靜了他的頭腦的時候，他還痴痴的不願意從舞台幻覺裏退出來，死死的一口「咬」住戲劇喊道：「那是人生不是戲！舞台上那個癩痢頭的小丑，分明影射的是我。旁邊那個靑衣唱的『光，亮，電棒。』根本就是她成心編詞挖苦我，因爲她明明曉得我在下面看戲嘛。」</p>
<p>我認爲單單禁止「戲劇舞台」上演出含有「諷刺」和「暴露」意味的戲劇是無用的，假如在「人生舞台」上，隨時隨地都有更無情的「諷刺」和「暴露」的「事」（以別於「戲」。）「發生」（以別於「演出」）的話，因爲這只不過是有條件的翻版而已。</p>
<p>只有制止「事」的發生，才能避免戲的反映。人生絕大部份的時間是生活在現實社會裏，因此他們經常看的是「人生舞台」上的「戲」，而在這裏顯示的劇情，可更多諷刺和暴露，試問如何「取締』？</p>
<h3>小城市的抗議</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>日前本報有一篇上海縣的專訪，其首節說：「上海縣雖然緊緊依傍着上海市，但無論在那一方面說，它和內地一般鄉鎭一樣，還停滯在落後的階段中」。這一篇文字的標題特別指出，這個小小上海縣的新舊縣長交替的時候，現款祗剩了卅萬元。</p>
<p>據我們所知，凡是被上海人稱爲鄕下的任何城市或鄕鎭，都處於跟小小上海縣一樣的環境：落後，而且倘然有新舊縣長交替的話，現款也不會超過卅萬元。所謂鄕下，其實是京滬與滬杭兩綫以至浙東浙西並蘇北各大小城市都包括在內的，連號稱天堂的蘇杭，也不是例外。</p>
<p>繁榮集中於上海，上海以外便是窮困與落後。要解釋這種畸形發展的原因，恐怕需要一番大道理，可是單單這偏畸的事實，已經足够使我們警惕了。現在內地的人，都在紛紛向上海跑，不是爲了政治與軍事，而是僅僅爲了想多賺幾個錢。同樣一個人，他在上海的收入，要比他在鄉下所能得到的可達十倍左右。因爲上海有事業，而鄉下祗有寥寥幾個噉飯的地方。在上海他可以投機或拼命（多兼職）而賺到一些錢，在鄕下他就英雄無用武之地，祗能在饑餓上呆着。</p>
<p>上海的失業人數逐漸增加，而鄉下則受着人才缺乏的威脅。不論政界，學界，商界，都需要優秀的人才，却苦於無法羅致。於是本來停滯的內地，就格外見得落後了。然而現在要回到鄕下去是需要相當勇氣的，一個大縣的縣長太太，爲了生活不能不出來敎書，一位科長的太太胸前一塊大補綻，走在街上買小菜。這種精神都令人欽佩，可是上海有多少人肯回去吃這個苦？</p>
<p>上海的繁榮不能是空中樓閣，它須建築在復興的農村上面。然則誰去復興農村呢？</p>
<h3>台灣的溫泉與草山</h3>
<p>— 陸明</p>
<p>台灣的氣候是春天加夏天的結晶，因此減去了三月至九月的一個夏天之外，餘下的一半都是春天，台灣是談不到冬天，也找不到秋天。</p>
<p>即使是嚴格的說，台灣的春天，應該是在二月以前來臨的。</p>
<p>我現在想介紹台灣溫泉地的著遊。如果到過台灣的一遊的，我想總不至沒有去過台灣的溫泉地草山和北投，前者淸靜，幽雅，後者却充滿了繁華影像，甚至帶有些俗氣，因之我愛前者。</p>
<p>草山拔海七百餘公尺，在夏天也是非常凉快，因此說她是「靑春永駐」，也決不爲過。她面對着觀音山，這山像躺臥在大自然中的觀音的頭部。太美了，只有身歷其境，才能形容其美。而廣漢水田，遙望台北，更有人間天上之感。和暖的氣候使人意懶，而溫泉一浴更使人心曠神怡，穿着浴衣散步在常綠的小園，這種享受「在中國能有幾處」？</p>
<p>而更值得一提的；他絕不是有錢的人才能享受，她很平民化的，不要一二百元台幣，已可在此間流連一天。</p>
<h3>看看台灣的交通</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝人最近才由台灣回到上海來，因爲有些事情要去辦，所以每天都要乘幾次電車和公共汽車，看到上海電車上擠軋紊亂的現象，不免想起了台灣公共汽車上井然有序的情形，因此願借貴報一角，把台灣公共汽車上的辦法，供獻給上海交通當局，作一個改善的參考：</p>
<p>他們是——</p>
<p>（一）車上不售票，每假站口有一個售票處，這些售票處幷不是專設的，而是代辦性質，其權利義務，和郵票印花代售辦法相似。</p>
<p>（二）乘客憑票上車，上車時把票交給車門口的收票員査騐，收票員把票根扯下交還乘客上車，（如電影院的收票辦法一樣，但是不要領粟。）下車時，乘客把車票交給收票員銷廢。</p>
<p>（三）票價劃一，無論遠近，不問綫路，統統一律。乘客可以買一本帶在身上，隨時取用，方便之至。</p>
<p>以上辦法，他的好處很多，如：</p>
<p>（一）可以减少傳票員軋票找錢之煩。</p>
<p>（二）可以减少售票員，在乘各羣中擠軋之苦，同時可以减少層小扒竊的機會。</p>
<p>（三）乘客上車後，不必再準備取錢買票等手續，可於上車前在售票處從容購票。</p>
<p>（四）倘若做到無票不准上車的話，（台灣是無論軍警都要購半票）那麽査票制度，可以廢除。</p>
<p>（五）票價蘭化劃一，這與乘客公司各方面的便利，不言自明。不過上海方地或因公司多頭關係，不無問題，但是倘若統一管理的話，這也是不成問題的。管見及此，專祝撰安！</p>
<p>台灣一旅客敬啓四月廿二日</p>
<h3>這一次的交響樂</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>上海市政府交響樂隊，准於四月廿七日（星期日）午後五時，在蘭心大戲院公開演奏，這是重整後的第一次，我特地去拜訪那位戴粹倫敎授—他是樂隊主持人，也是音樂院院長—承他在繁忙的工作裏，抽出一些時間和我接談。</p>
<p>本來音樂院院長職位，是不能兼職的，但是吳市長因爲上海不能沒有這樣一個樂隊，而且對於文化的設施，尤其少不得，在沒有辦法使數先生兼職之前，很使市長爲難，最後市長毅然把市府交響樂隊交給本市音樂院管理，於是問題就解決了，這是這次整頓前的經過。</p>
<p>在經費缺乏的上海，對於樂隊的經常費用，當然很少，經戴先生的努力，居然把上海所有幾位傑出的音樂家請來帮忙。大概中國人與外國人各佔一半，他們的酬報少得可憐，不過他們因爲知道這是任務，不是談報酬的。</p>
<p>這一次的演奏節目如下：</p>
<p>（一）序曲“Coriolano”具多芬Beethoven</p>
<p>（二）第一組曲　勒斯比基Respighi</p>
<p>A伯爵蘭多之舞會</p>
<p>BC古舞曲</p>
<p>D假面舞會</p>
<p>（三）交響第三十九　莫札爾特Mozart</p>
<p>A徐緩—快板降E大調</p>
<p>B用力之慢板</p>
<p>C小步舞Menuotto　allegro</p>
<p>D終曲快板</p>
<p>（四）悲歌（絃樂合奏）　愛爾格Elgar</p>
<p>（五）A愛爾蘭調選目「代爾村」</p>
<p>（六）牧者之呼聲　克林哥爾Grainger</p>
<p>指導：富華敎授。</p>

<h3>白山黑水血濺紅</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>「九一八」以來，敵人在東北的侵略行爲，眞是罄竹難書，以我們身受迫害的人來紀錄那些侵略的暴行，應該是如何的眞實而深切。可是在「白山黑水血獲紅」裏，編導者，却給觀衆帶來一個空洞而幻想的故事，他並沒有從敵人的毒辣統治政策上，加以暴露，也沒有描寫老百姓被壓榨下的疼苦生活，而只是將幾個靑年男女的三角戀愛構成了故事的中心。那劇中的男主角黄志剛，他不過是一個個人英雄主義者，他憑着他的熟血衝動幾次暗殺敵人，而事實上，在敵人嚴密統治下的哈爾濱，像他這樣的人物，單憑他的衝動是不能存在的。最滑稽的是，劫獄那一段戲，二個中國靑年，只換上了敵人憲兵隊長的制服，就可以在敵人憲兵隊裏横衝直撞，爲所欲爲，這完全是常識以下的事情了。</p>
<p>顯然的「自山黑水血濺紅」編導者是受了「卡薩布蘭卡」的影響，但比起後者來那是顯得多麽的脆弱，其實在敵人統治下的東北土地上，正有着無數的人民鮮血，濺紅了這白山黑水，爲了抗拒侵略的暴行，他們慘烈的在跟敵人進行搏鬥。這些光榮的史實，他不去接觸，而轉過頭去拾取那些三角戀愛題材，使人感到十分的惋惜。</p>
<p>導演劉國權對戲的處理，顯得很零亂，塲與塲之間，鏡頭與鐘頭的剪接，都有着無法彌補的毛病，這是導演對「蒙太奇」的理解與運用的錯誤了。</p>
<p>演員中，魏鶴齡的黄志剛，雖無特殊成績，但演技極穩健，林靜的女醫生與阮斐的舞女太弱了，項堃的陳醫生是全劇最佳的一人，密吿後的轉變過程，尤爲難得的收獲。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>祝兆年吹着口哨，推開校門走進去的時候，緋緋和榮兒正在操塲上玩浪木和　翹板；緋緋的臉漲得像柿子一樣的紅，小榮更是滿頭大汗。</p>
<p>「又吹這個調子了！不好聽！不好聽！」緋緋老遠就向他這樣撤嬌似的喊。</p>
<p>小榮一翻身從沙地上爬了起來，又着急又高興地奔上來迎接，一路還在高喊：</p>
<p>「祝伯伯，糖！糖！糖！」</p>
<p>這會兒老祝可沒有時閩跟他們多逗了，隨手打衣袋裘掏了兩顆糖給小榮，便三步併兩步的跑進蘭她們住的那間大敎室去</p>
<p>蘭正在摺疊才洗乾的衣服。</p>
<p>「有一綫希望了！」祝兆年氣急地說：「還是金愛麗帮忙，諸老頭兒答應帶一個。」</p>
<p>素來比任何人都鎭定的蘭也不由詫愕地看了老祝一眼，但並沒有就揷嘴問。</p>
<p>「這當然是一件很　　的事。」老祝也懂得她的心理。「可是我想風聲這樣的緊，車這樣的困難，你一個人帶着兩個孩子，要逃難可眞不容易，能够讓他們給你帶走一個也是好的。現在問題是在究竟讓緋緋還是小榮跟他們先走？」</p>
<p>這倒眞是一個大問題。祝兆年根本就沒有什麽意見可以貢獻，因爲他對於　覺文的家事知道得太少了；蘭雖是極重理智而又很有主張的人，但逢到這樣的事，也不免多所顧慮起來。</p>
<p>最後，她才決定讓緋緋搭諸協理的小包車先走，因爲緋緋大一些，金愛麗招呼她也可以容易一些。</p>
<p>蘭便開始把行李分散起來，老祝帮着她收拾較重的東西；就在這時候，緋緋和小榮都進來了。</p>
<p>「媽！是不是我們今天又要走了？」緋緋搶着問。</p>
<p>「不，你一個人先走。跟金阿姨她們走！」蘭輕輕地吿訴她。</p>
<p>「你們呢？」緋緋有些一困惑。</p>
<p>「我跟弟弟慢一些走，因爲沒有車……。」</p>
<p>「不！不！我也不走！我要跟你們一起走！」她一蹤就跳到了　的身旁，緊緊地抱住了，她母親的腿。（四三）</p>

<h3>The Government Committee is the Highest Decision-Making Body; the National Defense Committee Announces its Dissolution; Staff Members are Dismissed with Severance Pay as Usual</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Supreme National Defense Council will cease accepting documents from the 24th and is in the process of concluding its affairs, expected to be fully completed by the end of this month. Furthermore, the Central Political Committee has already commenced operations at the original location of the National Defense Council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] With the reorganization and establishment of the National Government Committee, the powers of the Supreme National Defense Council have been transferred. An official announcement has been issued, declaring its dissolution. The council was established in Chongqing in January of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], and during the War of Resistance, it exercised the powers of the Central Political Committee, deciding on the highest national policies, achieving remarkable accomplishments over ten years. However, the council's predecessor can be traced back to the Central Political Conference, making its history twenty-three years to date. The Central Political Conference was established in Guangzhou in the 13th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1924]. It was not until the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935] that a resolution was passed to reorganize it into the Central Political Committee. In the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it was decided to suspend the powers of the Central Political Committee and transform it into the Supreme National Defense Council to replace it. At the same time, the National Defense Advisory Council was established as an auxiliary body, broadly inviting individuals from various sectors to participate. This later evolved into the National Political Council, which is now the highest organ of public opinion in the nation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang convened the Second Plenary Session of its Sixth Central Committee, resolving that the National Government should be the highest organ for deciding national affairs and deciding to abolish the Supreme National Defense Council. Subsequently, the Central Committee decided that the council should be dissolved on the day of the reorganization and establishment of the National Government. Now that the reorganization of the National Government is completed, and the National Government Committee has also been established, the council should be dissolved accordingly. The Secretariat of the council has already issued a public notice, ceasing to accept documents from today and commencing the winding-up process. It is understood that the staff of the council will be reassigned to different positions and given severance pay according to past precedents issued by the Central Party Headquarters, distributed according to their years of service. It is rumored that the original location of the council at Dingjiaqiao will soon be transferred to the Central Political Committee for use.</p>
<p>First Meeting of the Political Affairs Committee</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Political Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 29th. Zhang Qun arrived at the Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 24th to assume office and immediately announced the appointment of Liang Yingwen, Fu Zhuangping, and Zhou Junliang as Counselors of the Executive Yuan, Feng Fei as Confidential Secretary with the rank of Recommended Appointment, and Zhao Yinglun as Chief of the General Affairs Section. It is also reported that Hu Shanheng, the Chief Accountant of the Executive Yuan, will be transferred to the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics as a Comptroller, with Chen Kewen, the head of the Deliberations Section, succeeding him in the vacated position.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The newly appointed Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Gan Naiguang, stated today that future work will focus on efficiency, and several principles will be established for colleagues to follow. Furthermore, Gan's affairs during his tenure at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have not yet been completed and are currently being expedited.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] Chen Qitian of the Youth Party spoke to reporters today on the issues of democracy and civil war, stating that the reorganization of the government is the beginning of China's democratic politics, and whether democracy can be realized depends on whether all parties have a democratic spirit. There are many reasons for today's civil war, but the main one is that there is too little democratic element. He hopes that all parties can lay down their arms in order to achieve the goal of democracy. He himself is a peace advocate. The civil war is spreading throughout the country, and the people cannot bear the suffering. If the Communist Party is willing to make peace and restore national transportation, but the civil war continues, then this is a matter between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the Communist Party is unwilling to lay down its arms and unwilling to restore national transportation, then this responsibility should be borne by the Communist Party, which is also a matter between the new government and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Youth Party held a full-day meeting on the 24th to discuss internal issues. The list of candidates for the remaining Political Affairs Committee member, the two Vice Ministers of Agriculture and Economic Affairs, and the participants from twelve provinces and seven special municipalities, which the party has not yet submitted, will be decided only after Zuo, Chen, and others go to Shanghai and convene the party's Central Standing Committee. Zuo and others plan to travel to Shanghai on the night train on the 25th, and Li Huang is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 28th. According to Zuo, the party headquarters will not move to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The newly appointed Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, met with reporters on the evening of the 24th and stated that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's policy plans already have a comprehensive plan from the government; he does not intend to make any changes. At the same time, he does not intend to change the existing technical personnel of the ministry. As for the candidates for the two Vice Ministers, the Permanent and Political Vice Ministers, they have not yet been determined. Furthermore, the former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zhou Yichun, visited Zuo today but did not meet him.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Legislative Yuan held its 323rd regular meeting yesterday, the 24th, in the morning and afternoon, presided over by President Sun. Important bills were passed, including the Banking Law and the Organizational Statute of the National Assembly Representative and Legislative Yuan Member Election General Office. The Organizational Statute of the National Economic Commission was also brought up during the meeting, but because some members argued that since the government has been reorganized, it is necessary to consult the new Executive Yuan on its views on the commission, it was decided to postpone the discussion until the next regular meeting. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan's 324th regular meeting is scheduled to be held on May 1st, at which time the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, will attend to explain the policy direction and answer various inquiries.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Banking Law was passed its third reading at the Legislative Yuan's 323rd regular meeting on the morning of the 24th, completing the legislative process. The Organizational Statute of the Central Trust Bureau was also passed at the same time. According to reports, the draft of the Banking Law was thoroughly studied and revised during the previous regular meeting and passed its first reading at the meeting. However, because the Bankers Association raised some concerns and hoped they could be adopted, it was decided to retain the second reading procedure and bring it up for discussion at this meeting. After the bill was presented at the meeting today, Zhang Yiyuan, the original drafter, first reported on the opinions of the banking industry on the bill, explaining the points that the banking industry hoped for. Based on Zhang's report, the main points were discussed, and Article 51, "The credit extension of a business firm shall not exceed 20% of its total deposits," was changed to "25%." In Article 51, "A specialized bank may make loans secured by real estate, but the total amount of such loans shall not exceed 10% of its total deposits," was increased to "15%." Article 93, paragraph 2, "A native bank that has been approved for business registration before the promulgation and implementation of this law shall be renamed a bank if its capital meets the requirements of Article 19, paragraph 1," was changed to "may be renamed a bank." The provision in Article 97 regarding native banks not being allowed to establish branch banks was deleted, largely adopting the opinions of the banking industry.</p>
<p>When the Organizational Statute of the Central Trust Bureau was presented, Jian Guanzan and others advocated that the bill be postponed for study and discussed when the China Banking Law was presented. Liu Butong and Wei Tingsheng believed that the business of the Central Trust Bureau was important and should not be delayed. After a clause-by-clause discussion with slight revisions, it was passed. The main change was: The public reserve fund drawn from the net profit of the Central Trust Bureau in each fiscal year was originally set at 50%, but it has now been changed to 30%. Peng Chunshi requested that the fourth item of the bureau's business, "the government," be removed, but it was decided to maintain the original proposal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Legislative Yuan continued its meeting from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by President Sun, to discuss the following bills: (1) The Finance Committee, in conjunction with the Economic Committee, reported on the examination of the Draft Special Business Tax Law and the Draft Amendment to the Business Tax Law, and it was resolved to pass the amendment.

<h3>Details of Lin Biao's Assassination: Shot Dead Amidst a Conflict of Opinions with Li Tianyou at a Meeting of Senior Northeast Communist Army Cadres</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] Further details have been obtained here regarding the assassination of Communist Army leader Lin Biao, as follows: On the 28th of last month, Lin Biao convened a meeting of senior Northeast Communist Army cadres in Harbin to review future work guidelines. Lin Biao advocated fighting to the end, while Li Tianyou proposed the following five points: (1) The Council of Foreign Ministers failed to discuss matters concerning the Chinese Communist Party; (2) Failure to meet the requirements of a certain country, so there is no hope for future assistance from that country; (3) The losses in the battles of Siping Street, Dehui, Jiutai, and Nongan were too great, and no progress was made; (4) After the fall of Yan'an, there is no guarantee of victory; (5) The necessities of life are gradually decreasing. Based on the above situation, efforts should be made to resolve the issue peacefully. Lin Biao failed to answer his questions and said that Li had a rebellious heart, saying that in every offensive, the Koreans were the first to fail (Li is Korean), and that it must be under Li's instructions and should be severely punished according to law. At this time, Li's confidant, seeing Li in distress, suddenly fired two shots at Lin Biao, hitting Lin's lower abdomen. Lin's guards immediately shot Li's confidant dead and sent Lin to Nangang Municipal Hospital. The hospital was unable to treat him, and he was transferred to the Jewish Hospital on Wudao Street the next day. After the hospital's director, Gou Loubeifu, performed surgery, he died after lingering for a day and a night. The body was placed in the hospital's basement ice cellar. Li Tianyou has been sentenced to death. It is said that Lu Zhengcao has succeeded Lin.</p>

<h3>Chen Yi Answers Reporters' Questions, Taiwan Governor-General's Office Hastens Handover Pacification Work Expected to be Completed by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Chen Yi answered the following questions at a press conference at 3:00 p.m. today:</p>
<p>(Question) The outside world criticizes the Governor-General's Office for being too lenient in politics and too strict in economics. What is Governor Chen's opinion?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Central Government believes that Taiwan has been occupied for half a century and the situation is different from other provinces. It has decided not to pursue those who participated in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association during the Japanese era, so it has to be lenient in politics. As for the economy, people have different views. I think there is nothing wrong with it. And in a helpless situation where we can neither request financial assistance from the Central Government nor intend to increase the people's taxes, if we do not operate public enterprises, there will be no way for finance and it will be difficult to promote construction work. Then Taiwan will not have the current situation. And I have not neglected private enterprises. I originally intended to open up public company stocks and focus on subsidizing private enterprises.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the current security situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is no worry about the security of the whole province. Now only Taipei is worse. Tax revenue in other counties and cities has recovered, and there are fewer thefts. There are not many bandits hiding in the mountains. Young students have all returned. All pacification work is expected to be completed by the end of April.</p>
<p>(Question) Can provincial, county, and city councilors who participated in the February 28 Incident and have now repented and reformed still be councilors?</p>
<p>(Answer) We are studying it. There is no answer yet.</p>
<p>(Question) When will Chairman Wei come to Taiwan?</p>
<p>(Answer) He will come to Taiwan in a week or two. We are speeding up the handover procedures here.</p>

(3) The institute can enjoy two-fifths of the rights to vehicles distributed by the railway, but transport merchants cannot.

<h3>Ninety-Eight Groups of Anti-Tax Associations Petition Hong Kong Revises Direct Tax Law Tax Rate Remains the Same, Taxable Portion Reduced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] The Hong Kong and Kowloon Committee Against Direct Taxes passed a resolution on the afternoon of the 23rd to send a telegram to the British Colonial Department requesting that the Hong Kong government stop collecting direct taxes. The committee also decided to convene representatives of the 98 groups participating in the anti-tax movement at noon on the 24th to petition the Governor's Office and the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 20th] Due to the opposition of Chinese merchants to the direct tax system and their scheduled petition to the Governor today, the Hong Kong government has made revisions to the direct tax law submitted to the Legislative Council. The standard tax rate remains at 10%, but the personal allowance has increased from 50 yuan to 7,000 yuan per year, the spouse allowance has increased from 4,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan per year, the child allowance is 2,000 yuan per year for each of the first and second children, 1,000 yuan per year for each of the third and fourth children, and 300 yuan per year for each child from the fifth child onwards. All of the above allowances are exempt from direct tax. In addition, the property repair allowance is also set at 20% of the income and can be tax-exempt. Before the revision, it was estimated that the annual direct tax revenue could reach 12,000,000 yuan. After the revision, due to the reduction of the taxable portion, the tax revenue will inevitably be greatly reduced, especially benefiting those with lower salaries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 24th] A delegation from the Chinese Committee Against Direct Taxes called on Hong Kong Governor Young at noon today and submitted a petition, the content of which was similar to the letter sent by the committee to British Colonial Minister Jones yesterday, which stated that the Chinese do not oppose the principle of taxation, but feel that the collection method is not in line with Chinese customs. It is said that the Governor has agreed to have the Legislative Council discuss the matter. The members of the Committee Against Direct Taxes are mostly members of Chinese merchant associations.</p>
<h3>National Defense Ministry's Troop慰勞 Group Arrives in Xi'an from Southern Shandong</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 24th] A group of more than 30 people from the National Defense Ministry's Troop慰勞 Group arrived here from southern Shandong.

<h3>Qingdao Yizhong Cigarette Factory Shuts Down</h3>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 24th] The Yizhong Cigarette Factory here has now shut down, which is the first tragedy of the civil war for commerce. The factory was the British American Tobacco Company before the war. It was established for more than 30 years and usually employed about 2,000 people. Before the war, its various brands of cigarettes were sold in North China and as far as Shaanxi and Gansu. It did not stop production even under Japanese management during the war. After the war, the factory was returned to its original owner and was intact. The reason why it is now forced to shut down is firstly because the Jiaoji Railway was destroyed by the Chinese Communist troops, cutting off the sales route to the interior of Shandong, and secondly because cigarettes from Shanghai and the United States are pouring into Qingdao, taking away the factory's market share. However, the factory has not yet dismissed its employees and is still paying living expenses.</p>
<h3>Japan's First Batch of Reparations Materials Distribution Quantity Undecided Allied Headquarters Compensation Expert Denies Shanghai Rumors</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Shanghai previously reported that China would receive 600 tons of materials in the first batch of reparations materials, including machine factories, chemical factories, and a shipyard. Compensation experts at Allied Headquarters believe that such rumors are premature. Compensation experts pointed out that the distribution to the countries requesting compensation has not yet been decided, but it is generally known that China will receive half of the 30% provisional compensation. Personnel at Allied Headquarters told the Central News Agency reporter that a list of factories as initial compensation will be drafted soon, and the distribution can be decided soon. Compensation experts at Allied Headquarters also believe that Shanghai's report that the Chinese Ministry of Communications has concentrated ships to prepare for the transportation of all reparations materials is overly optimistic. They also told reporters that the dismantling, packing, and transportation of Japanese industrial equipment have not yet begun. The Japanese will need several months to install their factory equipment and transport it to various ports to wait for shipment.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Starting from Wallace's Speech</h3>
<p>Former U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace has been touring European countries, giving speeches everywhere, criticizing President Truman's policies, and alarmingly stating that a third world war is inevitable. This has not only made a profound impression in various European countries, but has also caused serious repercussions in the United States. Looking at the current world situation from these controversies, we feel even more bewildered. However, French Socialist Party leader Léon Blum published an article in the People's Daily the day before yesterday, expressing his views on the current world situation: Firstly, he believes that the United States does not want war, and a third world war will not break out; Secondly, he believes that the difference between Wallace and President Truman lies in the methods, while their goals are the same - everyone is creating and consolidating world peace. We feel that the views of the French Socialist Party leader largely coincide with our views on the current world situation. Recently, opinions in the public opinion circle regarding international issues seem to be very complex, and there is a need to seriously examine the reality.</p>
<p>These past few days can be said to be the darkest period internationally. In Moscow, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has become deadlocked and cannot extricate itself, and it is expected to end unhappily, causing those who yearn for peace to feel disheartened. In Washington, the House and Senate have been discussing the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, filled with an atmosphere of anti-communism. Looking at U.S.-Soviet relations, there is also a trend of worsening. Although it cannot be said that war is imminent, such developments are ultimately harmful to world peace. Therefore, how can the U.S. and the Soviet Union be reconciled and how can the creation of world peace be successful? This is indeed the most serious problem currently, and it is urgent for politicians and diplomats of various countries to use their political wisdom to seek a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Wallace has delivered several speeches in the capitals of England, France, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Summarizing the main points of his speeches, we can divide them into two points: (1) The contradictions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are deepening, and President Truman's current policies may cause the world to experience war again; (2) The U.S. aiding Greece and Turkey outside the United Nations framework may cause these countries to break away from the United Nations and take political actions that the U.S. deems satisfactory. In fact, the above two points are still one problem. In other words, in Wallace's mind, he ultimately feels that President Truman's foreign policy is a dangerous anti-Soviet policy, which not only cannot guide the world towards a path of peace and prosperity, but may lead the world to war and destruction. However, examining the U.S. foreign policy since the end of the war, its basic goal is to seek world peace and prosperity. The only path it has taken is to strengthen the authority of the United Nations as much as possible. All things that are beneficial to world peace are welcomed by President Truman, and all things that weaken the authority of the United Nations are things that President Truman does not want to hear. Wallace's criticism of Truman's policies, in our view as a third party, does not have sufficient reason, and we strongly believe that Wallace certainly hopes that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will understand each other and restore the spirit of fighting side by side during the war to jointly create world peace. However, does President Truman himself not hope for the Soviet Union's understanding and cooperation? Secretary of State Marshall went to Moscow at his own expense and tried every means to ensure that the U.S. and the Soviet Union could reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues, which is an excellent proof. Wallace said in Paris the day before yesterday: "It is the duty of the United States to lead the world towards peace and prosperity." It is remembered that President Truman also said in a speech to the Democratic Party at the beginning of this month: "The United States has an unshirkable responsibility for creating world peace, so it should bear the responsibility of assisting all people whose freedom is in danger." It can be seen that Wallace and President Truman are completely consistent in their goals and have no differences. The only difference is in the methods adopted by the United States to achieve this goal. Obviously, President Truman has not hesitated to adopt a tough policy towards the Soviet Union and believes that "in order to assume the responsibility of creating world peace, the United States must maintain sufficient military strength to make all countries in the world believe that the United States is determined to act in accordance with its responsibilities." Wallace believes that this tough policy only increases the Soviet Union's stubbornness and will not obtain the Soviet Union's understanding. If this continues, a third world war is inevitable. Therefore, should the United States adopt a tough attitude towards the Soviet Union? Or should it adopt a policy of appeasement, compromise with the Soviet Union on everything, and satisfy the Soviet Union's demands everywhere? Which of these two methods is the road to peace? At least at present, no one can predict. Recalling the course of the outbreak of World War II, no one can deny that the weakness and incompetence of democratic administrations and the British Conservative Party cabinet's appeasement policy towards aggressors were the immediate causes of the outbreak of World War II. Therefore, we agree with Wallace's proposition in principle, but we really dare not agree with the methods and paths he wants to take. Fortunately, Wallace also has self-awareness. He also said in Paris: "The goal I am currently working towards will definitely be approved by the American people, but most of them disagree with me on the path to achieving peace."</p>
<p>Standing on the position of a third party, to speak fairly, the evolution of U.S.-Soviet relations to this point is by no means caused by one country unilaterally. If the two countries are to reconcile in the future, it cannot be promoted by one country unilaterally. Therefore, Blum also said that the improvement of the friendship between the two countries depends on the efforts of both sides. Moreover, the crux of U.S.-Soviet relations lies in the difference in ideas and the conflict of interests. How can we eliminate ideological differences? How can we achieve consistency of interests? It is not possible to achieve results simply by talking about understanding with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Now, countries around the world, especially the United States, Canada, Turkey, Greece, and other countries, are trying to prevent the penetration of communism. Right and wrong are currently difficult to judge. However, we ultimately believe that prevention is a passive measure, not a fundamental solution. To prevent the spread of communist ideology, the most important thing is to effectively improve the economic system so that the lives of the majority of people can be improved. However, while the United States is actively assisting Greece and Turkey to prevent the invasion of communist forces, it does not seem to be concerned about China, which is openly facing armed rebellions by the Communist Party. Even the 500 million US dollars that have long been designated to be loaned to China are still "allocated but not paid." This cannot but make us question the consistency of American policy. The United States cannot become a prosperous island. Since the United States knows to prevent the activities of the Communist Party within its scope and wants to help Greece and Turkey resist the invasion of communist forces, it is necessary to actively provide assistance to China, which is currently facing the threat of the Communist Party, both for the sake of China and for the sake of the United States itself.</p>

<h3>The Meeting Concluded After 45 Days of No Achievement, The Foreign Ministers Conference Announced Its End, and Delegations from Various Countries Departed for Home</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] London, 24th (Broadcast): Marshall has decided to end the Foreign Ministers Conference tonight and has ordered the first batch of personnel from the U.S. delegation to depart for their country on the afternoon of the 25th. The last Foreign Ministers Conference will hold a final discussion on the Austrian issue and determine the location and date of the next Foreign Ministers Conference, which will be held in New York around the fall of this year. Marshall will return to the United States on his private plane on the morning of the 25th. The train for the French delegation has been prepared one day in advance and will depart tonight if the meeting can be concluded earlier. The British delegation's train will depart 24 hours later than the French delegation's train. Also, news: When the Foreign Ministers Conference concludes tonight, Stalin will host a banquet for the representatives of various countries in the Kremlin to bid farewell.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 24th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has adjourned without results on the 24th. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement on the 23rd, severely condemning the Soviet Union, and decided to end the fruitless Foreign Ministers Conference after 45 days of failure. Marshall has announced his intention to leave the Soviet capital and ordered the first batch of the U.S. delegation to leave the Soviet capital on the 25th. Marshall's decision is a public acknowledgment of the complete failure of this Foreign Ministers Conference. The purpose of convening this conference was originally to draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The four powers had long abandoned their efforts to reach a peace treaty with Germany. The main obstacles were the Soviet Union's insistence on extracting reparations from Germany's current production, large-scale relocation of German industries, and failure to reach an agreement on the political system of Germany after the completion of the peace treaty. The breakdown of negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty was caused by the Soviet Union's strong support for Yugoslavia's demand for the cession of territory from Austria and the Soviet Union's demands for German property in Austria.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 23rd] The Foreign Ministers Conference today was the longest and most heated, but major issues remain unresolved. The four foreign ministers agreed to try to end the meeting tomorrow. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall accused the Soviet Union of obstructing the Austrian peace treaty and the U.S. proposal for a four-power agreement to disarm Germany. It is said that if the Austrian peace treaty cannot be completed before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in September, the United States supports transferring the entire issue to the United Nations General Assembly. Regarding the main clauses of the Austrian peace treaty and the four-power agreement, the Western three powers are in agreement, while the Soviet Union alone holds dissenting views. Molotov's rejection of the four-power agreement was to incorporate it into almost all important disputes over the German issue among the four powers in a modified form. I would only like to state one point, that the U.S. government solemnly stated that this action "is tantamount to the Soviet government rejecting the agreement." Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied that the United States is trying to force other countries to sign its draft and does not allow for amendments. The intention of the U.S. delegation can be said to be "to replace the Potsdam and Yalta agreements with a new, narrower agreement." British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault tried to ease the U.S.-Soviet dispute. Bevin interjected, "If someone initiates the construction of a bridge between the East and the West, it is best not to obstruct it." Marshall reiterated that since the London Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union has not made any new proposals regarding the Austrian peace treaty. The opinions expressed by the Soviet delegation afterwards not only failed to narrow the disputes among us, but expanded them. The three secret meetings to discuss the Austrian peace treaty in recent days have completely failed. The only constructive action was the Soviet Union's agreement to the British proposal to return all prisoners of war to Germany by the end of next year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with French Foreign Minister Bidault this morning. According to well-informed sources, the two foreign ministers discussed the date and location of the next four-power foreign ministers conference. Foreign Secretary Bevin supports holding the next Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva. It is also learned that the French delegation was originally scheduled to depart for home tomorrow night, but it has been postponed until the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Important Issues Regarding Germany Will Be Left for Discussion at the Next Meeting</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 23rd] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference, at 5:30 PM today, discussed the statistics presented by the subcommittees and reviewed the agenda of the meeting again, and reached the following resolutions: (1) The following issues will be returned to the subcommittees for continued research: (A) all issues regarding the organization of German state governments; (B) all issues regarding the procedures for reparations stipulated in the peace treaty with Germany. (2) The following issues will be returned to the Allied Control Council in Berlin for handling or review: (A) The four powers' agreed-upon guidelines for German disarmament, denazification, political democratization, population exchange, and re-delimitation of borders should be implemented one by one; (B) The points on which the four powers have different opinions on the above five issues should be re-examined; (C) The Foreign Ministers Conference has approved the legislation to liquidate the state of Prussia in March 1947, and the Allied Control Council in Berlin will also be notified. (3) All German economic issues, such as economic unification, industrial standards, and reparations, will not be discussed for the time being and will be left for discussion at the next Foreign Ministers Conference. In addition, the Allied Control Council is requested to provide reports on the above three issues. (4) The issue of German borders will also be left for discussion at the next Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<h3>The U.S. House of Representatives Will Also Pass the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act</h3>
<p>Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee States</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Eaton, Chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently expressed confidence that the House of Representatives will follow in the footsteps of the Senate and pass the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 23rd] Undersecretary of State McNeil replied to a question in the House of Commons today that Britain is opposed to the United Nations overseeing U.S. aid to the Greek state, because this move is particularly unfair. In such a situation, to require oversight, but not when other countries provide similar assistance to European countries, is a stimulating discrimination.</p>
<h3>Several U.S. Warships Will Be Transferred to Greece</h3>
<p>The Aim Is to Enhance the Strength of the Greek Navy</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 23rd] It is reported that Greek Navy Minister Venizelos will work with U.S. Naval Attaché to Greece, Admiral Spruance, to study ways to enhance the strength of the Greek Navy. It is rumored that the United States will transfer several minesweepers and two destroyers to Greece.</p>
<h3>Documents of the Balkan Investigation Committee Mysteriously Disappear</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 23rd] The United Nations Secretariat recently announced that all documents of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee mysteriously disappeared en route from Greece to Turkey, and their whereabouts are unknown. Details are unclear.</p>
<h3>Impasse in Korean Problem Difficult to Break; Should Convene Four-Power Conference; Reportedly British Government Supports Our Country's Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] According to well-informed sources: The British government will support China's proposal, advocating that if the impasse between the US and Soviet authorities in Korea cannot be broken, a Four-Power Conference (US, USSR, UK, China) should be convened to discuss the Korean issue. Simultaneously, the London Times published a letter to the editor from Lim Dung-jik, leader of the Korean delegation in the UK. Mr. Lim suggested that the US and the Soviet Union should simultaneously withdraw their troops without waiting for each other, and then Korea should establish its own government through national elections.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Well-informed sources expressed their opinions today, saying that it is meaningless for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to accept US Secretary of State Marshall's invitation to resume discussions on the Korean issue, because the Soviet Union's obvious goal is to continue to insist on opposing Koreans who oppose temporary trusteeship from participating in consultations on organizing a provisional government. They said that the point insisted upon by the Soviet Union (which in the United States is considered an unacceptable cancellation of freedom of speech) is something that the United States cannot agree to accept. They continued, unless the Soviet Union is prepared to soften its position, as indicated in Molotov's letter, there is no hope of cooperation when the US-Soviet Joint Commission resumes. Qualified sources suggested that Marshall should issue another statement pointing out that Molotov's reply does not in fact meet the conditions for accepting the US invitation, because it fails to agree to the principle of freedom of speech for Koreans. Most observers believe that Marshall is highly skeptical of obtaining a genuine agreement with the Soviet Union on the Korean issue at present, but is only waging a psychological war to leave room for the US Congress to accept the administration's plan to provide substantial economic assistance to southern Korea.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] Regarding the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to discuss the fate of Korea, official sources here recently stated that although the United Kingdom participated in the discussion of this issue at the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in 1945, it has not yet been decided whether to participate in the current US-Soviet negotiations. The only representative of the United Kingdom in Korea is its consul stationed in southern Korea, and the United Kingdom does not have a military delegation stationed in Korea.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to the US Returns to Post</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Soviet Ambassador to the US, Novikov, has returned to his country to report on his work, which has been completed. He will now return to his post, and this afternoon took a plane from Orly Airport to New York.</p>
<p>A meeting between New Zealand representative Belendsen (Envoy to Latin America) and our country's representative Liu Chieh (Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs) during the first meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council.</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Debates Foreign Relief Bill; Meeting Filled with Anti-Communist Atmosphere</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The House of Representatives discussed the $350 million foreign relief bill today, without reaching a conclusion, and postponed the discussion until next Monday.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] Regarding the US appropriation of $350 million to assist China, Poland, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Austria and other countries after the UNRRA ceased operations, the House of Representatives held a meeting to discuss it. According to observers, today's meeting was filled with an anti-communist atmosphere, similar to the atmosphere in the Senate yesterday when it discussed the aid to Turkey and Greece bill. Although the bill discussed by the House of Representatives today stipulates that the US President can stop providing assistance to any country that refuses to comply with the prescribed conditions, Democratic and Republican members of the House of Representatives continued to speak out against assisting countries dominated or controlled by the Soviet Union. Among them, Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declared: Communist ideology is the irreconcilable enemy of the United States. I oppose our assistance to the enemies of the United States. The government authorities are requesting Congress to approve an appropriation of $750 million to assist foreign countries. Congress is facing a very difficult situation. The world must choose between freedom and slavery. The former is the path followed by the United States, and the latter is the path followed by the Soviet Union. The US aid bill for China, Poland, and other countries stipulates the following three guarantees: (1) Relief supplies should be distributed without discrimination based on race, religion, or political views; (2) Beneficiary countries must agree to publicly disclose the quantity of relief supplies provided by the United States as much as possible. Recipient countries should guarantee complete freedom for American radio and newspaper reporters who wish to observe the distribution of relief supplies; (3) Beneficiary countries must not transfer American relief supplies to other countries or use surplus relief supplies to maintain their armies.</p>
<p>The State Department has submitted a list of candidates for relief commissioners.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Acting Secretary of State Acheson recently wrote to Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that the State Department is carrying out a relief plan and now intends to appoint Allen, the European relief commissioner of the American Red Cross during World War I, to preside over it.</p>
<h3>US Communist Leader Suspected of Conspiracy to Commit Treason</h3>
<p>Thomas Requests Indictment</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] Chairman Thomas, a Democratic member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, today approached President Truman, requesting that the President order Attorney General Clark to indict communist leaders on charges of "conspiracy to commit treason."</p>
<h3>Communist Party Activities in Australia Creating Industrial Disturbances</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Canberra, 23rd, United Press] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt told the House of Representatives today that the Australian government is unable to prohibit communists from creating industrial disturbances throughout Australia, which is a serious crisis.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Speech to French Parliament; Few Listeners, Mostly Communists</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Former US Vice President Wallace delivered a speech to members of the French Senate and National Assembly today, but out of a total of thousands of members, only about a hundred were present, mostly communists. Wallace stated that in order to solve the peace problem, the anti-communist mentality in the United States must be eliminated. Wallace also said that he is not a communist but a progressive conservative. However, when a member asked him if he thought there were also progressive elements within the Soviet Union, Wallace seemed embarrassed. Wallace also said that he supports American capitalism, but feels that capitalism should adapt to the trend of the times.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 24th] Wallace's European tour is coming to an end, and he is scheduled to deliver his most insightful speech on France tonight. This morning, representatives of French political groups such as the Popular Republican Movement, trade unions, and socialist organizations will visit Mr. Wallace at the George V Hotel for talks. French Prime Minister Ramadier is scheduled to meet with Mr. Wallace in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Wallace delivered a speech here at the Foreign Policy Association, saying that if the United States continues to pursue its current policies, it may plunge itself into the worst depression in history within a year. If this economic slump can be alleviated by huge army and navy expenditures, it will also force other countries to make similar expenditures in the military sphere. However, if we want to prevent the economic slump from continuing after the war, the United States should, as a creditor nation, use its resources to engage in constructive work around the world. If this can be done, the price paid by Britain and the United States for carrying out peace work through the United Nations will be more economical than increasing military spending.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Wallace delivered a speech to the American Veterans Committee here, saying, I believe that what the United States and the Soviet Union are doing today has destroyed the sacred movement for which their young people sacrificed their lives. There is a huge movement in the United States now, and its impact may easily lead to a third world war. Regarding the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, if the United States goes beyond the United Nations and provides aid, and it is not constructive, these countries will deviate from the United Nations and tend toward the political actions that the United States considers desirable. We still remember when Truman introduced Churchill in Fulton, Missouri last year, calling him a "citizen of the other world." It should be known that the title of "world citizen" cannot be easily bestowed on people, but must be obtained through actions. Both the United States and the Soviet Union are willing to move towards peace in friendly relations. If the US government can act properly, I will also praise it. If I think a Soviet action is wrong, I will also criticize it. When hatred harms peace, I will never participate in any movement to isolate the Soviet Union or form an anti-Soviet camp, resulting in deeper hatred. However, I will do everything I can to promote understanding between the two major countries.</p>
<h3>Two Soviet Soldiers in Germany Injured by British Military Police</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] A newspaper in the Soviet sector of Berlin reported that the Soviet commander in Berlin, General Kotikov, yesterday informed the Allied High Command that two Soviet soldiers had been beaten severely by British military police, and one of the soldiers had lost an eye as a result. General Kotikov demanded an immediate investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] After the commander of the Soviet forces in Berlin, General Kotikov, protested to the Allied High Command about the serious injury of two Soviet soldiers beaten by British military police, the British authorities here officially responded, refuting the facts as stated by the Soviet side, stating that the two Soviet soldiers were arrested in connection with a shooting incident involving the coercion of two German women in the Spandau district of Berlin (i.e., the place where the incident occurred as claimed by the Soviet side). When the British military police first went to arrest them, the two soldiers fled into the Soviet military zone. Unexpectedly, the two later re-entered the Spandau district and again coerced the two German women. A British military police patrol stopped them, but the Soviet soldiers refused to listen and resisted arrest with force, and a conflict ensued. Both Soviet soldiers were injured as a result. One suffered five wounds. The head, eyes, and body were cut. The other also had wounds on his head and abrasions on his body. After the two were captured, they were sent to a British military hospital, but they refused treatment, and were eventually taken away by the Soviet military. At the time of the incident, the two Soviet soldiers were obviously drunk. After they were arrested, several ammunition magazines and bullets were found at the scene of the incident, the same as those found on them.</p>
<h3>President Truman Orders Abolition of the Office of Price Administration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd Special Dispatch] Truman recently issued an executive order abolishing the Office of Temporary Price Administration, and transferring existing controls on rent and civilian consumer goods to other government agencies for handling. Control over rice has been transferred to the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<h3>Chinatown Key Handed Over to New York City</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd Special Dispatch] Local Chinese officials in New York's Chinatown today handed over a key to New York City, symbolizing the good neighborly friendship between China and the United States. After the ceremony, local Chinese officials and New York City officials toured Chinatown and visited local Chinese cultural and educational institutions.</p>
<h3>Gale Causes Disaster in England</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The British coast was hit by the most severe hurricane, with wind speeds near 100 miles per hour at some points, and incidents involving ships occurred frequently.</p>
<h3>French Actress Challenges Drama Critic</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Theater actress Ms. Melville, because Parisian drama critic Taurène called her performance like a skeleton dancing, challenged Taurène to a duel with pistols. The two have each sent two representatives to discuss the time and place of the duel tonight. Ms. Melville is known as an excellent marksman.</p>
<h3>After Britain Withdraws from India</h3>
<p>— Translated by Our Newspaper Editorial Office</p>
<p>After Britain decides to withdraw from India in June 1948, India's long struggle for freedom and independence will come to an end. From then on, India will break away from Britain's shackles, although it is still uncertain whether it has the ability to govern itself. This step by Britain is due in part to Britain's weakness and incompetence, and in part to the increasing expansion of Indian national power.</p>
<p>Britain cannot decide to whom its authority will be transferred. The British Labour government holds an optimistic view, believing that the needs of the times will enable India to prepare to shoulder its responsibilities. Most of the rest believe that an independent India will eventually be established on the basis of unity. It is very likely that India's future will become a problem for the United Nations. At the same time, it is also very likely that chaos and civil war will occur among the 400 million people.</p>
<p>In India, there is an antagonistic relationship between Hindus and Muslims. This is by no means just a dispute between 250 million Hindus and 92 million Muslims, but a fierce social struggle involving religion, people, and regime. The Indian National Congress, led by Gandhi and Nehru, harbors the ambition of majority party rule, while the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, harbors the determination to separate the Muslim country. The two factions are competing fiercely.</p>
<p>The optimistic view of the British Labour Party is as follows: Since the sincerity of Britain's withdrawal from India has been determined beyond doubt, both Hindus and Muslims will inevitably begin to exert their inherent instincts for self-defense. With no external forces interfering and meeting each other directly, they will naturally feel that they have the necessity to cooperate. Although the method of resolution is unpredictable, everyone has a psychological feeling that a bad government of Indians is better than a good government of British.</p>
<p>It is a very obvious fact that the British have neither the money nor the military power to support India. The Labour Party feels that the sooner Britain grants India political independence, the more opportunities Britain will have to protect its commercial interests in India.</p>
<p>The comments of the London Times are sufficient to represent another view of the British. This faction also admits that Britain is too weak to implement its wishes in India. They do not believe that the withdrawal plan is an effective answer to India's current crisis. The cause of this crisis is first, because the Hindu and Muslim sides cannot cooperate in the interim government, and second, because the two sides are arguing over the method of drafting the future constitution. These critics suggest that Britain may be forced to choose a path between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League in India before 1948. They fear that a Hindu-Muslim conflagration could result in the collapse of the entire Indian central government.</p>
<p>Britain has several unfinished matters in India that need to be decided. Whether Britain will transfer its authority to the entire India, or to eleven provinces, or, according to the official statement, "transfer its authority in other most reasonable and beneficial ways to the people of India," remains an unresolved question. At the same time, the liquidation of Britain's treaty relations with the Indian monarchs is still pending.</p>
<p>The National Congress Party, composed mostly of Hindus, is obviously the most powerful political party in India, and the party has also reached a consensus with the militant Sikhs. Regardless of the traditional fighting nature of Muslims, Hindus are bound to have the upper hand in the event of a Hindu-Muslim conflagration.</p>
<p>Since Wavell retired, Mountbatten has succeeded him as Governor-General of India. When Nehru visited the Allied headquarters in Singapore after the end of World War II, Mountbatten, with foresight, had already become friends with Nehru, which fully demonstrated his statesmanship. Rather than saying that Mountbatten will exercise the privileges of the British King's representative in his capacity as the Governor of India, it is better to say that he will deal with the Indian issue as the chairman of a committee. (Translated from "World Report Weekly")</p>
<h3>Churchill Criticizes Government, Accuses of Improper Palestine Policy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Epping, Essex, 23rd] Former British Prime Minister Churchill spoke in his constituency today, saying that Britain is fighting endlessly in Palestine, trying to give the land to the Arabs. America and the Soviet Union's estimation and respect for our country have plummeted. The government is making light of important matters and has clearly ruined the vast Indian Empire. The government's policy in Palestine is completely different from that in India. The government is fighting there at all costs, and the troops are four times those stationed in India. Our country is fighting the Jews in Palestine to make the land belong to the Arabs, and is sparing no effort to do so, but the mismanagement in India has been despised by the whole world. When I was in the United States, I used my position to facilitate the Labour government's borrowing from the United States. Unexpectedly, after the success, they were deliberately wasted, and I cannot help but feel surprised and disappointed. The consumption of loans on tobacco and films accounts for the largest part. I don't know how we can overcome our country's difficulties after the loans are exhausted, unless there is another war. The intelligence and determination shown by our country will not be able to overcome it. Churchill then criticized the government's shortening of the term of military service from eighteen months to twelve months. Churchill finally stated that he has no political ambitions. The reason why he has not withdrawn from government activities is to fulfill his duty to assist the country.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Re-election Voting Held Today; New Government May Still Be Led by Yoshida</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Special Dispatch] Japanese voters will vote tomorrow to elect 466 members of the House of Representatives, which is the second election in the past week. According to the Asahi Shimbun, a total of 1,572 candidates are participating in this important election. The largest number is the Democratic Party, with 331, followed by the Liberal Party with 323, the Social Democratic Party with 282, independent candidates with 257, and the Communist Party with 120. The press predicts that voters will still adopt a moderate attitude when electing members of parliament.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] It is expected here that the conservatives will also win an absolute majority in the election of members of the House of Representatives, so the left-wing forces will be very weak in the new cabinet that succeeds the Yoshida cabinet after the 30th. The new government is very likely to be led by Prime Minister Yoshida again, and most of the current cabinet members will also be re-elected.</p>

<h3>Fast Train Derailment at Same Spot at West Lane; Fortunately, Brakes Applied in Time, Passengers and Goods Safe; Traffic on Nanjing-Shanghai Line Interrupted Again for Three Hours</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Jinling Express train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line derailed and overturned at the West Lane station between Lujiabang and Kunshan at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday. After repairs, traffic was restored that evening. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday, the No. 6 First, Second, and Third Class Express train of sixteen cars, traveling from Shanghai to Beijing, at 10:06 AM, when passing through the West Lane station's west branch track where the Jinling train overturned the day before, due to the newly paved roadbed being unstable, the second axle of the eleventh car, TP892, which was a third-class carriage, derailed again. The driver noticed it and immediately applied the brakes. Fortunately, the train speed had already been reduced at that time, and passengers and goods were safe. Subsequently, the railway bureau sent a rescue vehicle to the site for repairs, and the entire line was repaired at 1:10 PM, and traffic was restored at 1:30 PM. The No. 78 Express train, which was scheduled to depart at 12:20 PM, was suspended for one day. Traffic on the entire line was interrupted for more than three hours.</p>
<p>After the Jinling Express train derailed and overturned at West Lane station the day before yesterday afternoon, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched Director Fu Jun of the Railway Administration Department and Chief Wang Bi of the Machinery Department to Shanghai that night to thoroughly investigate the cause of the derailment. At 8:00 AM yesterday, they, accompanied by railway bureau officials Guan Duo and Wu Yukun, went to the accident site for inspection. Coincidentally, Deputy Director Hou Huohua of the bureau returned from Suzhou after visiting the injured passengers and met them at West Lane station. Deputy Director Hou and others had witnessed the derailment of the No. 6 train yesterday. When the reporter visited Mr. Hou yesterday afternoon, he still could not give a definite answer to the cause of the derailment of the Jinling Express train the day before, saying only that it may be due to the steel rails and sleepers being too old and rotten to withstand the heavy load of American-style passenger cars. A consultation and discussion will be held after the relevant departments investigate. Regarding the injured passengers the day before, the seriously injured person, Chen Panming, is currently living in Suzhou Public Hospital. He had a lot of bleeding from the head, but has been out of danger after emergency treatment. He had his appendix removed in Shanghai not long ago, and the doctor ordered him to rest for a few days before he can be discharged safely. The seriously injured train attendant Tao Zengrong is being treated in Qishuyan Railway Hospital. The remaining ten or so slightly injured people were bandaged and discharged, and sent back to their destinations separately.</p>
<p>In addition, the railway bureau originally scheduled to hold a meeting on traffic accidents yesterday afternoon, but due to another derailment incident yesterday, all the responsible personnel went to the accident site for investigation and repairs, so the meeting was postponed.</p>
<h3>Voices Under Heavy Price Pressure; Newspaper and Other Workers Request Unfreezing of Index</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] In recent days, price fluctuations have been drastic, and salaried workers have been severely threatened. In the city, workers had their cost-of-living index frozen by government order, and although there is a subsidy for the difference each month, the amount is very small. Now prices have skyrocketed several times, making it difficult to make ends meet, and life is gradually becoming difficult to maintain. They are now brewing to demand that the government unfreeze the cost-of-living index. This undercurrent is gradually expanding. The day before yesterday, workers in various yarn factories under the Fourth District Cotton Spinning Union submitted a document to the General Trade Union requesting the unfreezing of the index. Yesterday, the Zhonghua Book Company also submitted a document to the General Trade Union, and the Newspaper Industry Workers' Union also submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting that it be forwarded to the central government to unfreeze the index, stating: "Since the Supreme National Defense Council promulgated the economic emergency measures, stipulating that the wages of workers should be based on the cost-of-living index for January of this year as the highest index, the cost-of-living index of workers has been frozen in accordance with this method, so that wages do not stimulate prices, and prices can be stabilized, in order to save the crisis of industry and commerce. Later, there was also the provision for issuing subsidies for the difference, which was well-intentioned and sufficient to show that the authorities were concerned about the lives of workers. However, in recent days, the price surge has intensified, exceeding several times. Therefore, the reason for the high prices is undoubtedly not stimulated by wages, and as a result, the lives of workers are increasingly plunged into hardship. The association had previously requested that the central government restore the wage payment method based on the cost-of-living index for workers, and now, as a last resort, we sincerely ask you to consider the facts and submit them to the central government to restore the wage payment method based on the cost-of-living index for workers, in order to care for the lives of workers and maintain social order."</p>
<h3>Problems Arise in Wage Calculation Method for Employees of Linchang Textile Factory</h3>
<p>The wage calculation method for employees of the British-owned Linchang Textile Factory is based on an index compiled by the factory itself, using rice prices as the basis. Therefore, the government's order to freeze the cost-of-living index and subsidize the difference has nothing to do with the factory. Recently, employees, seeing that the wages they received in January and February could originally buy 3 dan of rice, but in March they could only buy 1.5 dan, and the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent days, and the income will depreciate. They submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting (1) The employer increase the rice by two sheng. (2) The rice index should be based on 10 yuan per dan as the standard base, and the wages for February, March and April must be reissued to the workers. (3) Otherwise, the cost-of-living index stipulated by the government will be used for calculation, and the difference will be reissued, the basic salary will be adjusted, and meals and accommodation will be provided.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Employees of the foreign-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting that wages be paid as usual for weekly holidays.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The more than one thousand mu of land in the Zhabei district, enclosed by iron wire by the enemy and puppet regimes, is currently used by the Joint Operations Headquarters Transportation Equipment Storage and Transportation Department, the Executive Yuan Storage and Transportation Bureau, and the Joint Logistics Headquarters First Supply Department, among other agencies.

<h3>Collision of Two Ships on the Huangpu River - "Hai Han" Suffers Damage, Suspends Voyage to Yingkou, "Yong Xing" Has Steel Plates on the Starboard Hull Dented</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's "Hai Han" transport ship, loaded with over 1,400 tons of commercial cargo, departed from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 2:00 PM yesterday, headed for Yingkou. When passing the Lujiazui section of the Huangpu River outside the Waibaidu Bridge, it encountered the "Yong Xing" ship of the Zhongxing Company returning to Shanghai from Qingdao. At the time, the tide was rising. The "Yong Xing" ship was coming from the east and, upon reaching the Lujiazui section, should have turned south to go with the current and proceed quickly. Because foreign ships were moored at buoys number one and two in that area, the stern of the "Yong Xing" ship swerved to avoid the foreign ships, giving way sharply to the right. Unexpectedly, the "Hai Han" ship was approaching the same area, intending to turn east from the south. Consequently, the two ships collided head-on without being able to avoid each other. Fortunately, the "Hai Han" ship was moving slowly, and its bow only grazed the main part of the "Yong Xing" ship's starboard side. Several steel plates below the deck on the "Yong Xing" ship, at the waterline, were dented. The bow of the "Hai Han" ship was damaged. The "Yong Xing" ship was still able to sail to the Zhongxing Wharf and dock. The "Hai Han" ship was unable to sail and immediately reported to the general office, which sent two small tugboats to tow it back to the Jinliyuan Wharf. Both ships require repairs. According to the Bureau, if the "Hai Han" ship is unable to sail, the cargo destined for Yingkou will be transferred to the "Hai Hu" ship for transportation. As for the issue of responsibility for the collision, the two authorities are awaiting formal reports from the captains of both ships before conducting an investigation and inviting experts for discussion.</p>
<h3>One-Year Sentence in "Foreign Tiger" Case Deemed Inappropriate by Original Informant</h3>
<p>The case of "Foreign Tiger," the Dutchman Miesberg, illegally engaging in foreign exchange operations, was previously judged by the District Court to a one-year prison sentence, with a confiscation of $40,000 in US currency and $20,000 in Hong Kong currency. The original informant in this case believes that the first instance judgment rendered by the court was inappropriate in its sentencing. He recently submitted four points of opinion, requesting the Songhu Garrison Command to forward a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office to file an appeal within the statutory time limit. Commander Xuan stated that since the case has been tried by the court, if the original judgment is indeed inappropriate, the prosecutor should file an appeal in the capacity of a party concerned according to law. This headquarters, bound by legal procedures, is not in a position to make such a request on their behalf, and approved the matter to be handled directly by the original informant with the District Prosecutor's Office.</p>

Yoshikawa Genichi, 29 years old, from Osaka City, Japan, formerly the Commander of the Machine Gun Company of the Tono Headquarters. On August 1, 1943, two civilians, Zhang Lejun and Wang Yinde, fled from the Communist-controlled area to Shuyang County. Enemy spy Li Yanlu learned of this and reported it to Wakabayashi Bunichi. He then led five enemy soldiers and a translator, Jin Chuan, to arrest and detain Zhang and Wang. They were interrogated day and night using torture and subjected to extreme humiliation. Yoshikawa Genichi was particularly violent during the interrogation. After the victory, the victims reported the matter to the Ninety-eighth Army Headquarters.

<h3>Examination Methods for the Savings and Remittance Bureau are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau is drafting measures to restore the personnel examination system for savings and remittance, and is submitting them to the Ministry of Transportation for approval and implementation. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the Bureau's personnel have always been selected through examinations. Since 1943, when the Bureau was ordered to handle national salvation savings business, new personnel were appointed without examination. After the restoration, this practice continued, and some new personnel were also appointed without examination. These personnel were employed under the titles of researchers, assistant secretaries, and compilers, totaling more than 1,200 people. This not only contradicts the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau's traditional examination system, but also caused considerable criticism from the Bureau's old colleagues. Furthermore, given the Bureau's current sluggish business, the affiliated institutions and personnel must be streamlined and reduced in order to save expenses. Regarding the method of reducing personnel, among the more than 1,200 current employees who have not been examined, examinations for Grade A and B postal workers and postal assistants will be conducted based on their qualifications. Those who are not admitted will be given severance pay and return travel expenses. This method will be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Transportation, and the examination will be held on a scheduled date.</p>

<h3>Sun Tianchangzhi, Suspected War Criminal, Questioned and Investigated by Military Tribunal</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of Korean Sun Tianchangzhi, suspected of being a war criminal, was heard for the first time by Judge Qu Zezeng of the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone yesterday. The defendant, dressed in a neat suit, appeared in court with his defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yang Linzhi. The accusers, Zhou Hanpu, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong, also appeared in court. Judge Qu questioned them separately based on the points in the indictment, the defendant's previous statements recorded in the High Court, and the various documents submitted by the accusers. Sun Tianchangzhi's testimony was generally the same as his previous statements in the High Court. Since yesterday was only for investigation, the case will be heard again by a collegiate panel for debate before a verdict can be reached. The main points of the Military Tribunal's indictment in this case are recorded as follows: "The defendant, Sun Tianchangzhi, with a background in mechanical technology, founded the Jingmi Arts and Crafts Company in Shanghai, manufacturing industrial machines such as lathes and milling machines, employing 77 male and female workers. After the enemy army occupied Shanghai, he was designated as a Class B military-designated factory by the enemy army headquarters in October 1944, ordering him to manufacture small milling machines and pumps. After the victory, the property was confiscated by the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and allocated to the state. After the Japanese surrendered, the defendant remained at the original site, but the factory ceased operations. On May 28, 1946, the Songhu Garrison Command was ordered to relocate Korean residents of the Hardoon Building and found eight telescopes and six small cameras in the defendant's showroom, suspected of military use, and summoned the defendant for interrogation. After investigation, the Command considered the case to be an ordinary criminal matter and transferred it to the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation on July 11 of the same year. The defendant was released on bail after submitting a written guarantee of 10 million yuan. In October 1945, Zhou Hanpu, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong reported to the Military Intelligence Bureau that the defendant had offered to repair aircraft to the enemy at the Jinliu Airport and had used the British-owned Moulotrie Music Store's main factory to collect coins for the enemy to manufacture ammunition. The materials at the warehouse at 1350 Seymour Road and the residence at 929 Route Petain were sealed off once, and the Japanese orders among them were confiscated, while the rest were returned. The accusers were dissatisfied and secretly reported to the Investigation Team again, which transferred the case to the High Court for trial. The High Court ruled that the charge of traitor was not established and transferred the case to this court. The defendant had an original factory worker's card during the trial in the Commercial Court, proving that the defendant did have collaborationist acts. Although the defendant claimed that the worker was fired and held a grudge, he admitted to offering 400,000 yuan to the enemy to purchase aircraft. In summary, the defendant does have suspicions of collaborating with the enemy and should be prosecuted in accordance with the War Criminals Trial Regulations."</p>

<h3>Father and Son Accused of Drug Trafficking in the Neighborhood, Defendants Still Vehemently Deny</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Wang Xianzong and his son Wang Yuwei were accused of being suspected traitors and trafficking drugs. The High Court held another hearing yesterday.

<p>[Report from our newspaper] The case of Chen Zixing, Chen Zhixiang, Shen Yemu, and Xia Laowu, among others, on suspicion of being traitors, was heard for the first time in the High Court yesterday afternoon. The first defendant, Chen Zixing, was accused of serving as the manager of the Hengyuanxing Cotton Mill and the Hengda Xinji Cotton Mill during the enemy and puppet periods, providing cotton yarn to the enemy. Yesterday, Chen admitted in court to serving as the manager of the above cotton mills, but claimed: "Hengyuanxing was a partnership operated by General Manager He. Hengda Xinji was leased to Zhang Boqin in May 1940 and renamed Hengda Heji. It was not taken back until July 1944. Zhang is now missing, but the intermediary lawyer Zhu Wende can be summoned to testify." He denied the rest of the charges of aiding the enemy. The second defendant, Chen Zhixiang, did not appear.

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>(1) Continued Residence</p>
<p>Wang Lu Miao Ying rented a floor of a house from a friend, Mr. Yi (Mr. Yi was the second landlord of the house), in the spring of the 35th year of the Republic. At that time, a lease contract was signed, with each party holding a copy. The contract stated, "This lease is for a term of one year, and after the term expires, it cannot be continued. The house must be immediately vacated and returned to Mr. Yi..." The lease on the house expired this spring. Can I continue to reside there and not vacate according to the lease?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] Since the right to renew the lease was waived in advance when the contract was signed, it is difficult to argue for continued leasing.</p>
<p>(2) Returning to One's Former Residence</p>
<p>Ma De asked: I have a house that my late father rented from the main landlord ten years ago. After my father passed away, the whole family moved back to our hometown to live, and the house was sublet (without a contract) to various subtenants. Recently, I need to move back to live there, but the subtenants insist on not moving out. I don't know if I can ask them to move out within a specified period. If they fail to move out after the deadline, can I file a lawsuit?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] According to Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, for leases with no fixed term, the parties may terminate the contract at any time. However, according to the provisions of Article 100 of the Land Law, the house cannot be recovered unless one of the conditions in each clause is met. If there is currently a need to recover the house for one's own use and you can provide concrete proof of recovery for personal use, you can sue the court to order the relocation and recovery of the house.</p>

<h3>Columbus Defeats Shantou Team to Win the Mayor's Cup Finals Spot; Women's Snowflake vs. Youth League Ends in Another Draw</h3>

<h3>Mayor Wu Cares About the Food Supply of the City: White Rice Price Limited to 170,000; Rice Distribution to Leave Warehouse at Least 9,000 Bags Daily</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The recent fluctuations in the rice market have caused great concern among the authorities.

The representatives stated that the price of white rice at the source has already reached 172,000 yuan, and adding shipping costs, selling it in Shanghai at 180,000 yuan would still not yield any profit. Moreover, the rice released by the Social Affairs Bureau has been slow to be delivered. Mayor Wu stated that the city has a sufficient stock of rice to maintain supply even if no more rice comes from the producing areas. The city government has decided to release 9,000 bags of rice daily, and the amount may be increased if necessary. It is true that the distribution of rice has been slow in the past, but starting from the 25th (today), it is stipulated that at least 9,000 bags will be released from the warehouse daily to meet the needs. It is strictly ordered that the trading price of white rice in the market shall not exceed 160,000 yuan, and the retail price shall not exceed 170,000 yuan. Violations will be severely punished. After meeting with the rice merchant representatives, a notice was posted in the North and South markets to convey the Mayor's intentions, and the rising trend has been somewhat eased.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of 1,660 piculs and 5 dou of goods. Transactions in white rice disappeared, while Bai Yuan rice rose sharply to 205,000 yuan, and Yin Yuan rice reached 194,000 yuan.

<h3>Mayor Wu Hosted the Press Yesterday to Explain Measures to Suppress Prices; Vowing the Utmost Determination to Eradicate the Black Market for Gold and Yarn</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu hosted the press at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on measures to deal with suppressing prices and the government's determination.</p>
<p>(1) Rice: The Mayor stated that he had absolute confidence in suppressing the price to below 170,000 yuan, and said that the price of rice in the producing areas rose on April 1st, and Shanghai followed suit on April 6th. At that time, there was concern that there would be a reverse flow of rice, so the city government did not immediately release rice. By last Wednesday, the price in the producing areas had been suppressed, so the government released 11,000 piculs every day. This amount is sufficient for the needs of the entire city and even exceeds the needs by 1,000 piculs. At that time, rice merchants also agreed that the retail price would not exceed 170,000 yuan. On Monday of this week, while he was in Hangzhou, he received a telegram stating that the price had fallen to 165,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, on Tuesday, a black market emerged, and the producing areas and Shanghai colluded to raise prices. Upon receiving this information, he rushed back the night before and decided with the Economic Inspection Office this morning that, starting from yesterday afternoon, the retail price should not exceed 170,000 yuan per dan, and market transactions should not exceed 160,000 yuan. It is believed that in the short term, rice merchants will adopt a wait-and-see attitude, but the city government can release 11,000 piculs every day to meet the needs of the entire city, and panic should not occur. However, two points must be noted: (A) Due to the high price in the producing areas, there is concern about a reverse flow, and the military and police have been ordered to strictly prevent this. (B) It is difficult to guarantee that small black markets will not occur. On this point, it is hoped that people's organizations and the press will act as the government's eyes and ears. If anything is discovered, report it immediately for strict investigation. The Mayor also hoped that the price of rice in Wuxi could be suppressed to the limited price of 130,000 yuan, so that the retail price in Shanghai could return to around 155,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Yarn: According to the Mayor's estimate, there are 20,000 bales of yarn hoarded in the city. It has been decided in consultation with the Economic Inspection Group and the Yarn Industry Association that all cotton yarn purchased within the last month and a half, after March 15th, must leave the warehouse before the end of this month, be applied for shipment for export, or be sold to spinning mills. The Economic Inspection Group has been ordered to strictly investigate hoarding of yarn in the city starting today. The counterparties to whom they are sold must also register with the government. If they are still not processed by the end of the month, the government will recover them at the original purchase price, forcing hoarders and speculators to release their goods, and the price of yarn will naturally fall. The Central Bank is actively seeking sources of cotton, which is expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>(3) Black Market for Gold and US Dollars: The official price of gold is 4.8 million, which is said to be quite different from the old black market price. However, repeated strict investigations by the Economic Inspection Group and military and police agencies have failed to locate this black market trading place. Now, the Mayor has ordered military and police personnel to disguise themselves as various characters and also instructed appropriate businessmen to try their best to find various routes to purchase black market gold and US dollars. If anything is discovered, arrests will be made immediately and severely punished in accordance with emergency economic measures. The government has the utmost determination and will definitely eradicate the black market.</p>
<h3>Diesel Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Rong Oil's sales were sluggish last month, as factories' quotas were sufficient, and prices once fell to near the allocated price, only 50,000 to 100,000 yuan higher. Now, due to some kind of stimulation, merchants are asking for 1.1 million yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Market Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Bituminous coal importers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and sales are becoming sluggish. However, sellers are still unwilling to lower their prices. Anthracite coal sales are active, and the trend is extremely brisk.</p>
<h3>Speculation Abounds Regarding Delivery Prospects; Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Erratically</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks engaged in intense battles between bulls and bears yesterday. Sellers repeatedly exerted pressure amid rumors of unfavorable delivery prospects. However, due to the repeated tightening of foreign exchange, buyers stubbornly resisted, resulting in rapid rises and falls, and dangerous turbulence. Many small investors suffered heavy losses, resulting in a sharp decrease in transaction volume and erratic fluctuations. However, Delivery Xinguang and Innerwear both closed at the limit up.</p>
<p>At the opening, all stocks opened higher except for Xinhua, which fell slightly. Innerwear even opened at the limit up, and Delivery Xinguang stopped trading immediately upon opening. Upon opening, Delivery Yongsheng saw a lot of back and forth between buyers and sellers, with 79, 171, 154, 133, 89, 199, and 84 buying, and 145 aggressively buying spot Yongsheng, pushing Delivery Yongsheng up to 4,770 yuan. 137, 4, 97, 178, 179, 177, and 171 sold, retreating to 4,520 yuan. 117, 215, 133, 85, 4, 68, 199, 142, 62, 68, 145, 76, and 35 all bought, rising to 4,830 yuan. 231, 22, 80, 85, 97, 171, 207, and 4 sold to within 4,700 yuan. At this time, due to reports of a contraction in the Hong Kong exchange rate and a surge in gold and US dollars, 231, 142, 224, 105, and 31 bought, and Delivery Yongsheng rose to 4,840 yuan. 69, 91, 42, 4, 235, 223, 153, 154, 28, 197, 97, 36, 177, 160, 199, and 145 scrambled to sell. Upon hearing news of successful loans, there was a sudden, catastrophic drop, plunging to 4,330 yuan. 197, 183, 97, and 85 seized the opportunity to buy low, rising to 4,450 yuan. 152, 145, 48, 12, 235, 223, and 61 all sold. People's hearts were already apprehensive, and Delivery Yonggong and spot Delivery Mei Ya both fell to the limit down, forcing the price down to 4,170 yuan. 85, 117, 179, and 171 seized the opportunity to buy low, once rising to 4,370 yuan. 145, 223, and 24 took advantage of the high price to close out positions, and the noon close hovered around 4,250 yuan. After the close, there was a slight increase to 4,300 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xinguang rose by half a percent, Zhongfa rose slightly, Yonggong and Mei Ya fell to the limit down, Yongsheng and Xinhua each fell by slightly less than ten percent, Huafeng fell by slightly less than half a percent, and Jingfu fell slightly. Delivery Xinguang rose to the limit up before pulling back slightly, Yongsheng and Xinhua rose slightly, Yonggong rose by slightly more than ten percent, and although Mei Ya fell to the limit down, it still rose by half a percent, because there was only half a day of trading the day before. The cold stock Innerwear rose to the limit up before falling slightly, still up by ten percent. Xinya and Lian rose by half a percent, Shangwu rose slightly, Zhongsheng fell slightly, Huochai fell by slightly less than ten percent, and the rest all fell by about half a percent.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, prices were already being called higher off-market. Affected by the tightening of foreign exchange rates reported by foreign news agencies, Delivery Yongsheng even rose to 4,500 yuan. 145, 165, and 97 sold at high prices, and the market opened only to fall to 4,380 yuan. 186, 177, 218, 232, 105, 85, 155, and 129 bought. Innerwear was the first to show a gain, led by 43, and soon Yongsheng rose again to 4,620 yuan. 85, 97, 167, 112, 129, 4, 2, 149, 154, 89, 48, 69, 224, 45, 141, 84, and 197 sold, and there was news of delayed issuance of large banknotes. After three o'clock, the market finally fell to 4,340 yuan. 152, 171, 169, and 89 seized the opportunity to buy low. The market was pulled up to around 4,530 yuan at the close. Mei Ya continued to trade at the limit down. Delivery Xinguang saw activity and closed at the limit up. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xinguang still had a large number of buyers. After rising to the limit up in the morning, it pulled back slightly. In the afternoon, it almost approached the limit up and was forced up by a slightly less than half a percent squeeze. Jingfu and Zhongfa rose slightly, Yongsheng fell slightly, Xinhua and Huafeng fell by slightly less than ten percent, and Yonggong fell to the limit down before recovering slightly, still down by slightly less than ten percent. Mei Ya fell to the limit down. As for delivery, Xinguang opened and closed at the limit up. Because there was only half a day of trading the day before, the rest of the stocks were squeezed up quite a bit. Mei Ya recovered after falling to the limit down, still up by half a percent. Yongsheng, Xinhua, Huafeng, and Yonggong rose by slightly less than ten percent to slightly less than half a percent. Jingfu was squeezed up by twenty percent. The cold stock Innerwear rose to the limit up. Cement was flat. Zhongfang and Tongyi fell by a little over ten percent. The rest of the stocks saw little trading. Except for Lian, which rose by half a percent, the rest fell by anywhere from slightly to half a percent. Off-market, Dasheng rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly.</p>
<p>Arbitrage Trading Banks Wait and See</p>
<p>For current and delivery arbitrage trading, the Yongsheng spread rose from 140 yuan to 22 yuan. Banks' willingness to participate was lackluster, as the base price had increased, and the unfavorable factors of the delivery prospects had intensified, suggesting preventive measures. It is reported that a large commercial bank had not rolled over half of its chips, causing the longs, such as 89, to actively seek to offer, creating a situation of too many monks and too little porridge. Today, the interest rate ranged from 1.1 fen to slightly less than 2 fen. The financial institutions also offered little in stocks such as Xinhua and Mei Ya, at a monthly interest rate of about 1.7 to 1.8 fen. The money market shows signs of tightening, reversing the situation of previous periods.</p>
<p>Hongri Xinguang Shines Brilliantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, Delivery Xinguang made its debut, showing its brilliance. It opened at 163, with 204 bidding to buy at 146.5 yuan, and immediately reached the limit up. The market price pulled back slightly in the middle as small investors sold to take profits, and the noon close was 135 yuan, with Baiguang at 130 yuan. After the afternoon close, people's hearts were uplifted, new longs joined in and aggressively bought, and financial institutions bought heavily. The market closed again at the limit up. It is rumored that a major player has organized a long company to push up Xinguang, with an initial target of 200 yuan.</p>

<h3>China General Chamber of Commerce Bank Celebrates its 50th Anniversary at Lido Garden Tomorrow</h3>
<p>China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, the first bank initiated in our country, will celebrate its 50th anniversary tomorrow (the 26th). All staff members of the bank's headquarters and branches in Shanghai will gather at their respective service units at 8:00 AM, led by their supervisors, to raise the flag and perform a commemorative ceremony. The history of the bank will be reported, and Chairman Du Yuesheng's motto of "Diligence, Prudence, Loyalty, and Respect" will be explained, encouraging colleagues to continue their efforts, cooperate with the national financial policy, guide industry and commerce, serve society, and make the bank's future even more brilliant.</p>
<p>From 9:00 AM, each unit will receive congratulations from relatives and friends and handle commemorative deposit and loan business. The bank's branches are distributed throughout the country, from Hangzhou and Ningbo in the east, to Lanzhou and Ningxia in the west, to Chongqing and Chengdu in the southwest, and to Tianjin in the north. They will all hold commemorative ceremonies simultaneously. Starting at 2:00 PM, the bank's headquarters will hold a celebration ceremony at Lido Garden on Taixing Road and exhibit the bank's cultural relics. Heads of agencies and leaders from all walks of life have been invited to participate in the grand ceremony. Chairman Du will personally preside over the opening ceremony, and the First Studio of the Central Film Photography Factory will send personnel to the venue to produce a sound newsreel for remembrance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chairman Du, with the virtue of frugality and love for the people, proposed to economize on banquets and extravagance and allocate 100 million yuan as a scholarship fund to subsidize 50 outstanding and impoverished college and middle school students, enabling them to continue their studies and become useful to the country. This proposal has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors and Supervisors. The proposal has received great attention from all walks of life. Speaker Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Council and leaders from industry, commerce, and finance have jointly published an advertisement in response, urging colleagues and friends to contribute to the cause, convert gifts into cash, and entrust the bank's scholarship fund management committee to collect and manage them, using them all for the scholarship fund, so that the number of scholarships for college and middle school students can be increased according to the proportion of income beyond the bank's original quota.</p>
<p>For days, cash has been sent in an endless stream to be collected by the bank's headquarters and branches in and out of the city. The deadline is set for the end of this month, and a summary table will be compiled and published in the newspaper. Moreover, people from distant provinces have sent letters to the bank, expressing their deep admiration for Chairman Du and hoping that this will further promote public opinion, and that legal entities and public and private enterprises will jointly promote the scholarship movement, transform social customs, support education, and eliminate illiteracy, which is an essential plan for national construction. It is reported that the bank is considering conveying this suggestion to the public opinion organs for adoption.</p>
<h3>Bond Solicitation Committee Hosted the Press Yesterday; The People's Love for the Government Can Be Demonstrated by the Results of Bond Solicitation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Solicitation Committee for the 36th Short-Term Treasury Bonds and US Dollar Bonds, in order to expand the publicity of bond solicitation, specially hosted the Shanghai press yesterday at 5:00 PM on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. The chairman of the committee, Qian Xinzhi, vice-chairmen Xu Jixun and other officials and forty to fifty reporters from various newspapers attended the meeting. First, Chairman Qian Xinzhi stood up and delivered a speech, stating that he and Vice-Chairmen Du Yuesheng and Xu Jixun were jointly hosting the Shanghai press today. Vice-Chairman Du could not attend due to dental problems, for which he expressed his deep apologies. He was quite optimistic about the prospects for this new bond solicitation. Given that the government had issued a large number of banknotes in the past, both the government and the people felt difficulties. It is now known that the purpose of issuing new bonds is to absorb floating capital. If the people can subscribe in large quantities, it will not only solve the government's difficulties but also solve their own difficulties. The government's temporary measures to deal with the current economic situation include the promulgation of new economic emergency measures. The fundamental measures, such as the promotion of new bonds, are an important aspect of this. The people's love for the government can be determined by the success of the bond solicitation. Good results have been demonstrated in the past three weeks. The press has made great contributions in helping to publicize, and it is hoped that they will provide even more assistance with publicity in the future. Vice-Chairman Xu Jixun then delivered a speech, stating that the government had no choice but to issue new bonds due to the imbalance in financial revenue and expenditure. The purpose was to contract the currency and to encourage savings. He hoped that the press would provide more assistance with publicity so that the work of soliciting new bonds could be smoothly promoted. Afterwards, reporters from various newspapers delivered speeches, expressing their commitment to assisting with the publicity of the solicitation and hoping that the government would devote itself to maintaining the integrity of the bonds. Subsequently, Deputy Secretary-General Fan Heyan reported that so far, the US dollar bonds had been subscribed with confidence for US$30 million. The China Bank and its branches would jointly subscribe for US$10 million, and the Small Four Banks would subscribe for US$200,000. Moreover, the total amount solicited by various banks and firms today (the 24th) also reached US$420,000. The tea party ended at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>In other news, in order to strengthen the solicitation work, the Shanghai Solicitation Committee for US Dollar Bonds was broadcasted last night by Chairman Qian Yongming from the Shanghai Joint Radio Station at 8:05 PM, under the title "Please Enthusiastically Subscribe to US Dollar Bonds."</p>
<h3>Grain Prices Soar Everywhere</h3>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 24th] Rice prices in Japan have skyrocketed, causing panic among the people. Chairman Shen expressed great concern about this and decided to allocate 110,000 piculs of grain from the provincial treasury to sell to public school personnel in Hangzhou at par to alleviate the immediate emergency. The Hangzhou Rice and Grain Purchase and Sale Committee also scheduled an emergency meeting tomorrow to discuss countermeasures. Today, the price of rice in Hangzhou, including the distribution of rough rice, is still 127,000.</p>
<p>Nanchang</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd] A long drought has been relieved by timely rainfall, and spring plowing is promising, which farmers celebrate. Grain prices in various counties have soared. Late rice in Ganxian and Yongfang and other places is selling for 150,000 yuan, and yarn prices have also broken the highest record. There are no transactions in the gold market.</p>
<p>Shenyang</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] The grain problem in Shenyang has recently become serious. The price of sorghum rice has not only risen but has also been reported to be in short supply, causing the people to cry out in distress. Various people's organizations have blamed the relevant agencies.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] The Executive Yuan's Economic Committee convened a meeting on the 24th to stabilize grain prices, presided over by Xiong Shihui himself. During the meeting, he strictly ordered the relevant departments to thoroughly implement resolutions on management, transportation, and sanctions, expecting that the flow of grain would be smooth and prices would fall.</p>
<p>Fuzhou</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 24th] Amid rising grain prices, students cannot attend classes on an empty stomach. Schools in various parts of Fujian Province have wired the provincial government, requesting funds to subsidize the purchase of school rice. The Provincial Department of Education is finding ways to allocate tax rice for sale at low prices.</p>
<h3>Black Market for US Dollars Rampant; Export Trade Stalled</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources in the export sector, the rampant black market for US dollars has been extremely detrimental to the future of exporters. Most merchants holding export goods are holding on to their goods and not selling. Therefore, the transactions of export goods have been extremely rare recently, but prices are still relatively stable. It is reported that ordinary woolen clothing is priced at more than 6 million per barrel, tung oil is 410,000 per dan, and Shanghai bristles are 2.6 million per dan. Some prices have increased by 10% to 20%, but most have not changed. There has not been a dramatic increase due to the issuance of large banknotes by the National Bank. Moreover, according to the current domestic market prices of various export goods, there are still many instances of reverse pricing compared to foreign market prices. For example, for tung oil, the domestic market price is about US$0.35 per pound, while the market price of tung oil in the United States is only US$0.30 per pound. Other items, such as rhubarb and gallnuts, cannot be exported based on current domestic market prices. Currently, China's export trade is almost entirely stalled except for some tung oil materials exported by the Central Trust Bureau and the China Vegetable Oil Factory. After the exchange rate of the US dollar was adjusted to 12,000 yuan, export trade only showed a slight improvement for half a month to a month after the adjustment. However, the good times did not last long, and the favorable trend of export trade was completely disrupted by the gradual increase in export goods and the rising trend of the black market for US dollars. The current solution, on the one hand, is to hope that domestic prices will stabilize and that the black market for US dollars will be eliminated. At the same time, it is hoped that foreign market prices can be slightly increased, so that China's export trade can be revived.</p>

<h3>Medical Newspaper Articles and Magazine Articles</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Writing articles is a difficult and arduous task. Writing medical articles is even more difficult and laborious. Ordinary articles can contain empty words and useless phrases. However, because medicine is a science, it must rely on concrete facts to speak truthfully. Say what needs to be said, and no more. If too little is written, the meaning will not be clear. If too much is written, the text will be too verbose. This is unlike other articles, especially those of a literary nature. The same article can be altered according to the writer's skill: it can be long or short, expanded or contracted.</p>
<p>Medical texts can be roughly divided into two categories: One is popular articles written specifically for the general public; the other is scholarly articles written for the medical community itself for research or discussion. For now, I will call the first type of popular text "Newspaper Articles"; and I will name the second type of scholarly article written for research or discussion within the medical community itself "Magazine Articles."</p>
<p>The terms "Newspaper Articles" and "Magazine Articles" are not entirely appropriate in a strict sense. This is because many medical magazines are specifically intended for the general public, and their content consists of articles on general knowledge. However, I am using these two terms merely as a general and hypothetical designation. Generally speaking, there are more newspaper readers than magazine readers, and newspaper readers are primarily members of the general public. Although some medical magazines are written specifically for the public, they are not as accessible or likely to attract public attention as articles in newspapers.</p>
<p>What are the differences between newspaper articles and magazine articles? As mentioned above, one type consists of popular texts written for the public, while the other type consists of scholarly texts written for research, discussion, and reporting within the medical community. In other words, although the writers of popular texts for the public are scientific experts from the medical community, the readers are mostly members of the general public outside the medical field. On the other hand, both the writers and readers of magazine articles are members of the medical community itself.</p>
<p>Because newspaper articles and magazine articles have such different natures, doctors in the medical field who take the time to write medical articles need to pay attention to the writing techniques involved.</p>
<p>To write magazine articles for the medical community, one only needs to accurately and directly present one's own research findings, factual situations, or theoretical opinions. All medical terms or specialized vocabulary within the text can be written down directly without the need for explanation. This is because the readers are all medical professionals who understand all these specialized medical terms and scientific vocabulary. Explaining them in detail would be redundant. Conversely, if one is writing newspaper articles for the general public, one must pay attention to the tastes of the readers – the general public. A child's food is not the same as an adult's food, because their stomachs have different digestive and absorptive capacities. Similarly, the general public, who often lack medical knowledge, and medical professionals naturally have different levels of understanding of medical texts. For example, when writing magazine articles for the medical community, one can write down any medical terms or scientific vocabulary as one wishes, without needing to explain them. However, when writing newspaper articles for the general public who lack medical knowledge, one must put in the effort to explain these specialized medical terms and fixed vocabulary in detail so that the readers can understand their meaning. An infant who has not yet grown milk teeth cannot chew sweet and hard Liangxiang chestnuts. Otherwise, the writer's efforts will be wasted, and the readers will still not be able to taste the flavor of the text.</p>
<p>Let me give a few examples: "Prognosis"—is this not a specialized term that we often use when writing medical articles? This most common and simple medical term is easily understood by medical professionals. It refers to our prediction of the good or bad outcome of a disease based on the "type" and "nature" of the disease, the "severity" of the patient's condition, the patient's past "constitution," and the "effectiveness" of current medical treatment, etc. However, the general public who lack medical knowledge would most likely not understand the meaning of this term. Or, for example, is there not a term called "expectant therapy" in therapeutics? This "expectant therapy" is also commonly used when writing medical articles. Medical professionals can easily understand this common term and know that the meaning of "expectant therapy" is: When encountering a disease for which there is no fundamental cure, the only thing to do is to maintain the patient's strength during the disease's course so that he can easily tolerate the various symptoms that occur, prevent its abnormal progression and the occurrence of other "complications," and quietly wait for the disease to run its course. In that case, the disease can often achieve a good "natural cure" effect. If the general public who lack medical knowledge were to read this term "expectant therapy" without a detailed explanation, how would they understand its meaning? Of course, such examples are everywhere and countless.</p>
<p>In addition to paying attention to such specialized medical terms and specialized vocabulary when writing newspaper articles, one must also pay attention to the text itself. The text itself must be simple, popular, clear, and lively. This is true for all scientific writing, but it is especially true for medical articles, particularly newspaper articles written for the general public. Simple and popular texts are more accessible, clarity makes them easier to understand, and liveliness can generate interest in the reader. Therefore, these are all important conditions that must be noted when writing medical newspaper articles.</p>
<p>"Vernacular writing" is simpler and more popular than "Classical Chinese," and it is easier to write clearly. As for liveliness, those who are good at using vernacular writing can often write very vividly and powerfully. Therefore, for medical articles, especially medical newspaper articles, I think it is better to use vernacular writing as much as possible. However, those who are not good at writing vernacular writing may write long articles, but readers will not feel its "simplicity" and "clarity," but will instead feel that it is a long and rambling piece that does not explain anything clearly. They will only feel that it is verbose and not lively or powerful. Therefore, writing simple and popular texts is not an easy task! It still depends on the writer's skill and talent, and the writer's ease of expression.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Oral Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Wang Gongfu</p>
<p>Our teeth are the gateway to the stomach, and the oral cavity is the general hub of both the food and air passages. The frequent comings and goings inevitably attract the covetousness of bacteria, which breed in the mouth. Some argue that the human mouth is clean, but this is a gross error. Who knows that the oral cavity, holding the power of import and export, is also a good gateway for bacteria to invade? Especially in the crevices between dental plaque and cavities, there are countless bacteria lurking. The number of bacteria in the mouth is actually greater than in any other part of the body. The bacteria that breed in the oral cavity come in many shapes and types. In terms of their shape, they can be roughly divided into three types: spherical, rod-shaped, and spiral. Because the bacteria that can reside in the oral cavity include any type, its inherent bacteria can also be divided into seven categories: (1) Oral giant bacillus: lives in unclean oral cavities, (2) Fusiform bacillus: commonly found in alveolar pyorrhea, ulcerative stomatitis, and the mouths of ordinary people, (3) Salivary spirochete: can often be seen in oral saliva, especially in the gums, (4) Staphylococci: often parasitizes in unclean gums and dental plaque, (5) Oral branched bacteria: can be seen in gingivitis and alveolar pyorrhea, (6) Sheathed iodine cocci: mostly found in dental plaque, (7) Dental spirochete: the most common site is the gums. Furthermore, because the oral cavity often contains various organic and inorganic substances, it is a most suitable natural nutrient source for bacterial life. In addition, the appropriate temperature and light in the mouth, movement and stillness, are all in line with the guidelines for their development. Oxygen, carbon salts, moisture, etc., also meet the basic elements for their survival (among which moisture is the most indispensable nutrient). Therefore, the reproduction of bacteria in the mouth is extremely strong. Because bacteria are also known as fission bacteria, they reproduce by fission. For example, when spherical bacteria divide, they first become oval, then split horizontally in the center to become two young bacteria; rod-shaped bacteria elongate in their length, then split into two. In this way, one becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight, and eventually proliferates to countless.</p>
<p>In order to avoid bacterial reproduction or kill them, some people often think that they can use some kind of strong, liquid mouthwash to drive them away. In fact, this situation is also absurd (it cannot be eradicated completely). If you want to reduce the reproduction of bacteria in the mouth, you need to fully remove the tartar accumulated in the dental socket (a hard substance accumulated on the outside of the tooth neck is called tartar). Therefore, this work must be done by a dentist. Drs. Ryder and Smith of the United States once said: "To keep your teeth healthy, you need to have a dentist clean them twice a month." But in reality, it is enough for us to implement this two or three times a year.</p>
<p>Oral hygiene should not be ignored, especially after baby teeth erupt in young children. Attention should be paid to the oral and dental hygiene, and the fingers should be used frequently to dip sterile cotton wool in 3% borax water to wipe them. Once the permanent teeth have fully erupted, they should be taken to the dentist for examination to see if there are any decayed teeth. If there are any, they should be treated early to avoid spreading to nearby teeth. At the same time, attention should be paid to brushing teeth, and they should be urged to do it perfectly. It is the same for us. We often neglect the method of brushing teeth and do not understand it. It is wrong to only brush the outside without brushing the inside, or to only brush horizontally from left to right. Therefore, when brushing teeth, you must first choose a smaller toothbrush with slightly harder bristles and a slightly curved shape. When brushing, you should make rotary motions from top to bottom, and each tooth should be brushed on the left, right, inside, and outside. Do this three times a day, especially the one at night, because food residue stays in the mouth overnight and can form a fermentation phenomenon and the reproduction of bacteria can damage the enamel of the teeth. If the teeth are not healthy and the chewing function is weak, the digestion of food will stop the stomach yang, easily causing gastrointestinal diseases and causing the whole body to lose health. Someone once made a statistic and said: "Every time you brush your teeth properly, you can remove one-third of the bacteria in the oral cavity." "Brushing teeth" is truly the only good way to remove bacteria from yourself.</p>
<p>The above is a little bit, dedicated to you readers, and I advise parents to pay attention to the future masters of the next generation and their own happiness.</p>
<h3>Calcium Gluconate</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>After reading Dr. Song Guobin's article "A Review of the Combined Injection of Calcium Gluconate and Vitamin C" in the fourth issue of this journal, I was filled with doubts. It is originally reasonable to use calcium gluconate and vitamin C together. Most doctors in Shanghai use this method. Because pulmonary tuberculosis consumes too much vitamin C, it must be replenished as much as possible. This is well known; otherwise, dry mouth, dry tongue, and dry skin will accelerate death! When encountering such patients, injecting 500 international units is not enough, and 5,000 to 10,000 units are also commonly known. Dr. Song insisted that its scientific name has the word "acid" and that it is made from sour oranges, so based on the point that "acidic substances may dissolve exposed substances," he thought that vitamin C could invalidate calcium. I ask, will the vitamin C originally in the patient's body also invalidate calcium! Therefore, I dare not agree with Dr. Song's high opinion. Is this the first point?</p>
<p>Dr. Song thought that "fibrous pulmonary tuberculosis patients already have saturated calcium levels in their bodies, and calcium injections may not be beneficial." By analogy, if calcium injections can be injected to saturation, wouldn't the patient become a malachite model? How much lime is in a calcium injection? Who doesn't know that most of the calcium in a calcium injection will flow out (be excreted from the body) after injection? Therefore, it is necessary to advise patients to take cod liver oil at the same time, borrowing the power of vitamin D to make the calcium settle. This is the second point.</p>
<p>As for elderly patients, Dr. Song thought that "injecting calcium agents again will make vascular sclerosis even worse." Is there any factual evidence to support this point? I also have great doubts. Even if this is the case, it is no different from giving up eating for fear of choking. For all pulmonary tuberculosis patients, regardless of gender, age, now using "calcium gluconate" for treatment is not considered outdated, and sometimes it lasts for two or three years without seeing any drawbacks. Whether or not vascular sclerosis is a secondary issue, because if pulmonary tuberculosis is not treated rationally, death will be faster than vascular sclerosis. This is the third point.</p>
<p>In short, without animal experiments to prove that "vitamin C can indeed invalidate calcium," the contradictory statement of calcium gluconate and vitamin C seems difficult to conclude.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Shen Songnian's article has some insightful comments on Mr. Song Guobin's assertion in the previous issue that "calcium gluconate should not be injected together with vitamin C." However, whether it is harmful to inject calcium gluconate and vitamin C in the same syringe into the patient's veins still needs to be examined by experts. The human body itself has its own "unique" function for controlling and dispatching acids and calcium. We cannot make wild guesses. Whether there is a chemical reaction between calcium and acid before they are injected into the vein after being mixed in the same syringe awaits examination by pharmaceutical experts. However, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. Xiangren does not take sides, so let both exist for the time being.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the New Chinese Medicine (4)</h3>
<p>— Hong Guanzhi</p>
<p>In addition, the several outlines of "cold, heat, deficiency, excess, exterior, and interior," which have always been used as the basis for syndrome differentiation, belong to a part of simple common sense and do not contain any profound philosophy. Although there are many places that secretly coincide with science, it is still a knowledge without understanding the principles and cannot be considered a foundation of learning. This is beyond doubt. Now I repeat here that the subjective experience must be consistently recognized and undisputed by the majority of people before it can be called experience. Therefore, Chinese medicine is not a "product of experience" and cannot be arbitrarily attached to. As for objective experience, Chinese medicine cannot presumptuously boast about it, let alone say more! If readers can carefully seek out all the contradictions in Chinese medicine theory and application with a calm mind, and then see what the experience that Chinese medicine talks about is all about? Whether the "phenomena" they experience are "facts" and whether they can hit the object and talk about the "essence," if you analyze it in detail, the question of "What is Chinese medicine?" can be roughly answered!</p>
<p>(3) Further Explanation for Scientification</p>
<p>Chinese medicine theory is "mystical," and the clinical aspect relies on a part of simple common sense. It is not real "experience," let alone called learning. It is not "scientific," of course, needless to say. However, even now there are still people who do not understand "science"! It is truly strange to say "Chinese medicine should not be westernized, it should be scientificized." Moreover, this wonderful article was also published in mid-December last year. Comparing it with Mr. Lu's article can be said to be interestingly contrasting. The author of this article is a Chinese medicine doctor named Mou Yunfang Guangsheng, who works in the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department. He opposes the scientificization method of "using Chinese medicine like Western medicine" and advocates the so-called "automatic Westernization." At first glance, he is a "Chinese body, Western use" theorist. After reading this wonderful theory, I couldn't help but shiver (not seeing a ghost in broad daylight, please don't misunderstand). This kind of fantasy of "Chinese body, Western use" has been tried by many people as early as twenty years ago, and it has failed without reservation. I think Mr. Mou has no common sense of historical evolution, so he will promote reversing the car. According to his meaning, "Chinese medicine" seems to be able to exist in the world for a long time and permanently oppose "Western medicine." However, it also needs to be improved and improved. His so-called "scientificization" is very vague. He probably wants to find a way to make Chinese medicine an independent discipline. Then how can it be worthy of the title of "scientificization"? This makes me have to say a few simple words about the nature of medicine and the definition of science, because people are "higher animals" in the metaphysical realm (that which is in the metaphysical realm is called a tool, and a tool is a physical object, not a wandering soul). Medicine is a learning that studies human physiology and disease treatment, so it is a "scientific" product, not "metaphysical philosophy." Moreover, the science mentioned here refers to "science in the narrow sense," which is the abbreviation of "natural science" in contrast to philosophy; in other words, it is scientific medicine that applies various natural scientific methods, such as biological mathematics, physics, and chemistry, for research (also commonly known as Western medicine). Mr. Mou believes that "the fundamental ideas of Eastern and Western cultures are completely different, so the knowledge of Chinese and Western medicine is also different. Europe has had the concept of things from the beginning, and everything is considered to be the reality of things." This statement completely obliterates history. I won't say anything else, just medicine. The predecessor of Western medicine also grew up in "mystical theory" like Chinese medicine, and it also went through a process of fantasy. They used to have medical theories of earth, water, wind, and fire. However, because of the progress of various aspects of natural science in the past 100 years, medicine has embarked on the road of science and become a new and independent science. From the perspective of philosophical thought or temperament and habits, Eastern and Western cultures have their differences, but medicine is "material" and not "spiritual." There is fundamentally no distinction between "Eastern" and "Western" cultures. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Informing Readers About Questions in Medical and Pharmaceutical Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>— Liang Jun</p>
<p>In the first issue of this publication, I pointed out the difficulties of serving in medical and pharmaceutical Q&amp;A and admitted the failure of this work in other publications in the past. I once had a hope to collect many similar questions together and give detailed general answers, and at the same time delete many unnecessary and unreasonable questions. This would not only benefit most readers but also reduce the trouble of editing. However, because this publication is edited by different editors in rotation, each person has their own ideas and style, so my suggestion could not be implemented.</p>
<p>Recently, the editorial department of this publication has received many articles from readers criticizing the impracticality of this medical and pharmaceutical Q&amp;A, "It cannot enable the questioner to get an answer in the short term, nor can it enable other readers to learn from it and benefit from it. As a result, it is inevitable to be superficial or to have the suspicion of promoting drugs." Mr. Youxian's article "Evaluation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Q&amp;A" in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao Medical Weekly last month more bluntly criticized the shortcomings of medical and pharmaceutical Q&amp;A published in various newspapers' medical and pharmaceutical supplements. This really makes us editors greatly awaken.</p>
<p>Originally, we did the work of medical and pharmaceutical questions with a spirit of sacrifice. We definitely did not mean what the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao said, "Some mediocre doctors do some medical and pharmaceutical Q&amp;A because their business is depressed, and they write their own names on each article to attract customers." That kind of meaning. However, the result is such public opinion, which is of course beyond our initial expectations. For now, we review the past and encourage the future. Naturally, there is a need to change the method. Therefore, we specifically tell readers that from now on, we will no longer answer medical and pharmaceutical questions that are too simple and too unsystematic. On the contrary, if a patient can describe his own medical history in detail, and his own observations and the process of diagnosis and treatment by Chinese and Western medicine, then we will definitely give an answer.</p>
<p>Some people think that medical and pharmaceutical Q&amp;A is unscientific and should not exist. This is a arrogant person who speaks big words with his eyes closed. If he has read medical and pharmaceutical magazines or medical and pharmaceutical supplements in European and American countries, then he will definitely know that he should not speak with his eyes closed like this.</p>
<p>Okay, let's not talk too much nonsense, but I hope our sacrificial work will contribute to the readers!</p>

<h3>The Double Confession of Hawaii</h3>
<p>— By Fassett, Translated by Qing</p>
<p>Her throat felt like scalded muscle, and she asked her husband for another glass of water. Aaron couldn't help but feel a shiver down his spine at her weak voice.</p>
<p>She was lying in front of a widely opened window. All sorts of breezes, nourished by a fragrant and joyful land and imbued with fragrant fats, filled their temporary wooden house with their breath. They brought the bitter fragrance of giant aloe, the sour taste of banana groves, and the natural aroma of the sea. The sun had just risen above the top of this island. A rosy seafoam further diluted the purple-blue taste of countless waves, and sometimes, within these waves, an even stronger ray of sunlight darted like a golden serpent.</p>
<p>"Please listen..." the young woman murmured.</p>
<p>At this moment, very near or very far – it was impossible to tell – a barely discernible song, accompanied by ancient instrumental music and clear vocal music, drifted over.</p>
<p>"Hawaiian guitars, Kittredge," Aaron replied. "Do these sounds make you uncomfortable? I'll send the servants to chase away these singers."</p>
<p>"No, Aaron, I beg you, please let them sing. They are good for me."</p>
<p>Exhausted by the abruptness she used in this plea, Kittredge gently turned her head to the side. Her arms, which had been folded across her chest, also loosened in a weak gesture. After a night of cold time, which made her feel that her whole body was nothing but broken wounds and fire, she now appreciated the sparse light of dawn with sensual pleasure.</p>
<p>Beneath her half-closed eyelids, her gaze wandered over the large garden, full of rare flowers and proud palm trees standing like sentinels. Further away, in the rice paddies, countless brown men were already bending over the ditches...</p>
<p>Finally, the young woman's heart, which had been working with difficulty, now beat even more heavily.</p>
<p>All this, the flourishing trees, the flower beds, the fields full of bright fertility and resources, was entirely Aaron's creation and territory. There was nothing that did not belong to him, including the coral reefs that the waves of the Pacific Ocean had just broken upon encountering them, nothing that did not bear the mark of his power and will.</p>
<p>How many times before, leaning by this sunlit window, Kittredge had felt a vague dread creep into her heart as she looked at this vista. What was the nature of her isolation from the world, living in the middle of these wild and fertile lands, her husband the sole master of these lands, countless gazes of glittering barbarians all bending their backs to serve these lands?</p>
<p>Slowly, she looked at him with a dark fear. He sat beside her with his head bowed, and Kittredge could only see his stiff, graying hair and his strong, dark gray nape. But everything about him was so naturally regular and even that she believed she could see his face at this moment: square forehead, aquiline nose, tightly closed mouth with strong lines, pointed chin.</p>
<p>"Is there anything I can do for you, sweetheart?" he asked softly.</p>
<p>"Will the doctor finally come?"</p>
<p>"The city is not close, and Ah Chen didn't go to get him until dawn."</p>
<p>In the young woman's heart, she felt a strange glimmer of triumph flash in her husband's eyes. Then the fear that often radiated from behind this hard mask made her tremble, stronger and more piercing than the high fever in her body.</p>
<p>As if he had guessed this distress, he raised his long, wrinkled fingers and placed them on Kittredge's forehead, then began to caress it. Initially alarmed by this touch, she gradually calmed down. Her previous fear had been in vain. Aaron loved her. Perhaps he loved her crudely and clumsily, but this love was like a fierce and profound fire that was difficult to recognize. She had already seen how attentive he was to her every desire, and how he often trembled with joy in his embrace. Hadn't he cared for her with patient and tender solicitude all night long yesterday? Since he belonged to her, and she was the one who could disrupt his life with a revelation, then why fear him?</p>
<p>The weakness that withered her young body relaxed her aversion to Aaron and moved her soul. Then a remorse awakened in her heart, and immediately dissipated, as if this remorse aroused a desire to recognize this face she no longer loved with a large amount of generosity.</p>
<p>She turned her head frankly towards him, a quick movement he had not anticipated; then she uttered a soft cry.</p>
<p>Because, in the lines of this face that had never been submissive, she saw a sadness so deep and a tenderness so poignant that she gained a horrifying certainty: death was already here, in this empty room, on these simple furnishings, and her husband had already seen the footsteps of death.</p>
<p>Many beautiful, bronze-like human skins were shining in the sun, which was more scorching than before. The sea breeze brought over a richer and more mixed fragrance, and the surface of the Pacific Ocean was nothing more than a large expanse of scorching jade.</p>
<p>Never had a loneliness more ferocious than this moment of certainty surrounded Kittredge. In helplessness, she really felt the need to cling tightly to this only man, so close at hand. But in order for this final communion to be sweet and helpful, she should tell him everything:</p>
<p>"Aaron!" she murmured in a voice that was already hoarse. "I don't want to take away a secret that is too serious without getting your forgiveness."</p>
<p>She paused, took another breath, and continued:</p>
<p>"I have not been faithful... Three days ago, a British warship sailed away. It carried a sign..."</p>
<p>At the end of her strength, she fell silent. Aaron looked at her, her face pale; he said to her in a calm voice:</p>
<p>"Me too, I need forgiveness, Kittredge. I know everything. That's why I used the poison of the Hawaiian medicine man on you yesterday." (Original text from the French weekly "Courrier de Chine" No. 6 by J. Kessel)</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 404</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"I have an absolutely secret coding method—a change of inorganic blended with organic, and it's simple and easy to learn."</p>
<p>"Show me the original copy." Shouyi reached out to ask for it.</p>
<p>"No way;" Hejian clapped his hands, "I didn't bring it with me; I rely entirely on memory… It doesn't matter, anyway, Zhengyan is here, he has the original coding copy and knows how to use organic methods…"</p>
<p>"Very good." Shouyi retracted the hand he had extended, "But this can only solve one aspect of cooperative technology, the transmission of messages—certainly, a very important aspect. There are also others: transportation, personnel, combat tools, symbols, language…"</p>
<p>"I think," Hejian's thoughts were stirred, and he also became enthusiastic, afraid of interrupting Shouyi's words lest he forget what he had thought of; "Since your Yu Jun and our Yue Big Brother are familiar, we will try to arrange for these two to meet once and discuss a concrete solution to these technical problems, so that everything between us is 'unified'… Unfortunately," Hejian clapped his palms again, as if he had lost an important document.</p>
<p>"Thought of something else?" Shouyi saw Hejian's appearance of scratching his ears and cheeks, his thoughts surging, and knew that he was a little over-excited at this time.</p>
<p>"It's hateful that there's no way to move some of our good players over to you, to let them be together for a period of time, even a short period of time, to let everyone merge and integrate their existing ideas, knowledge, and technology. That would be such a beautiful thing…</p>
<p>"The first is our Ji Yaoqun—a young lady of twenty-two or three; her intelligence and skills are truly first-rate—of course, I mean among the people I know now—there is also a Little Tiger, named Xiao Hucheng. How old do you think he is? …Only twelve years old—Chinese martial arts are also first-rate; if someone my size gently nudges him, I would have to crawl down. And that's being polite. Our Yue Big Brother personally saw him send two Japanese officers back to their hometown with two gentle touches." Hejian said as he performed.</p>
<p>"That's a heavy hand of the Daruma Palm type; which school is he practicing?" Shouyi also became interested.</p>
<p>"Alas, how would I understand these things?… The 'curious questions' I just mentioned refer to these things, and if Yue Big Brother hadn't said it so sincerely, I would hardly believe it. You see?…"</p>
<p>"Someone in my village has practiced this set;" Shouyi smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"Really?" The usually clever Hejian turned into a gourd at this time.</p>
<p>"Believe it or not!" Shouyi still smiled slightly.—The greatness of China, coupled with the confluence of thousands of years of civilization, and yet constantly suffering the oppression of how many dynasties of demon kings, with many talented and extraordinary figures focusing their attention, how many mysterious effects could be created! What is this little bit of martial arts worth?… It has always been suppressed by generations of demon kings, not allowing these figures to seize the opportunity to breathe, to cooperate with the times, and to advance towards material civilization… towards science, so that's why it has become such a terrible phenomenon…"</p>
<h3>A Call to Abolish Aesthetic Education</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Yesterday I read the newspapers and discovered that the Curriculum Standards Revision Committee of the Ministry of Education will abolish the art subject in middle schools and replace it with "Practical Arts", which made me feel an inexplicable sadness, sadness for the youth, for the national culture, and for the future of the country!</p>
<p>Therefore, I can't help but briefly state my humble opinions, sincerely hoping that the education authorities will withdraw their order as soon as possible and not let outsiders laugh at us.</p>
<p>Regarding the general issue of aesthetic education, as early as twenty years ago, Mr. Cai Yuanpei repeatedly advocated it, and he explained it clearly enough for us. Some friends may even remember that Mr. Cai advocated "replacing religion with art"!</p>
<p>The lack and hardship of material life during the long war of resistance has indeed befallen most people. At this time, advocating "aesthetic education" seems to be out of touch with the trend, but it is not.</p>
<p>When the Constitution was established, didn't we also see a clear provision to "promote art"? Therefore, we once eased our brows slightly, but unexpectedly, today, after the government reorganization, the dignified Ministry of Education not only violates the Constitution, but also, following the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to "abolish art normal schools," simply plans to abolish the "art" classes in all secondary schools across the country. Which strong country is this educational policy imitating? It's really puzzling!</p>
<p>Although the War of Resistance has been won, what have we gained after eight years of hardship?</p>
<p>Lack of living materials, a pitiful and frightening human heart, destruction of religion and morality, chaos in social order, rampant corruption and bandits….</p>
<p>If this continues, how can national fortune be revived? How can the people live?</p>
<p>The difference between humans and other animals is that one relies on wisdom to control life, and the other relies on instinct to strive for life; the same is true for the division of humans into civilized and barbaric. The former is able to develop wisdom through the cultivation of a suitable personality, while the latter is unable to break free from the control of instinct and has no way to move upward, thus appearing ugly, stupid, rude, and vulgar.</p>
<p>Looking at countries around the world, how are the strong and the weak divided? How are rulers and the oppressed formed? I have never heard of a strong country without culture, nor have I seen a strong country weaken or destroy its own culture. If there is one, it is China.</p>
<p>Art is an important part of culture. Destroying art is tantamount to destroying culture, and destroying culture is tantamount to destroying the country.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the current China, where all material civilization is far inferior to Western Europe and the people's lives have reached extreme hardship, we should improve people's hearts and provide spiritual food, so that those who are trapped in poverty and pain will not succumb to poverty and pain, and those who are on the verge of despair; those who are not trapped in poverty and pain will not fall into idleness or tend to extravagance. In other words, a person who has been cultivated by aesthetic education has an eternally happy spirit, a noble temperament, and a pure soul; no matter which class he belongs to, he has a world in a pot; no matter when or in what situation, he will not be swayed or confused. He will always maintain tranquility, nourishment, youth, hope, and light. That is to say, he has obtained spiritual relief through the cultivation of beauty.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we do not provide him with spiritual food to make his mind healthy, he will inevitably pursue material enjoyment. The painful become more painful, the unyielding yield (traitors are an example), the desperate commit suicide, and the idle become more extravagant, frivolous, and lewd. But in the end, their spirit is still painful, their temperament is bound to be perverse, and they only have a stinking shell without a true soul. Thus, betrayal, confusion, anxiety, desolation, disappointment, darkness... all envelop him layer by layer. On a small scale, it turns him into a machine for manufacturing dung, a living corpse. On a large scale, corrupt officials, traitors, and national traitors are all like this—educated to value only material things.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to say categorically: if we want to make human minds healthy and achieve true peace in the world, there is no other way but to strive for spiritual construction. A great educator should urgently and unreservedly take on this great mission. Moreover, we are not a militarist country with ambitious intentions, we do not need to regard education as a tool of war.</p>
<p>Furthermore: the purpose of Chinese education is to acquire the necessary general knowledge of all subjects in middle school: any country's middle school education can be used as a reference—even the materialistic Soviet Union has not abolished art education in middle schools, how can we progress to such an extent?</p>
<p>The purpose of my loud cry is not to seek a way out or beg for food for myself or on behalf of my colleagues; nor do I foolishly hope that every middle school student will enter the room of fragrant orchids, but I am only afraid that outsiders will come to China as if they have stepped into a shop selling stinky abalone and will all cover their noses and pass by.</p>
<p>Taking a few dozen steps back: if the middle school art class is for the so-called "practical arts" (according to the newspaper's joint Ministry of Education proposal), then, as Mr. Lü Fengzi said in his letter refuting the Ministry of Education: ..."Practical arts should at least include the production of practical and applicable objects, and how can one produce applicable objects without first making drawings? And how can one not seek to have beautiful forms? That is to say, even if we do not discuss the function of the art subject itself, but only in terms of teaching practical arts, we cannot do without relying on art..."</p>
<p>Even a deeply cultivated Mr. Lü said such a thing, but I don't know if the proposer of the Ministry of Education's proposal has thought about it like this? Furthermore, I don't know how he will answer? We are very interested in waiting. (April 23, at Ningbolou)</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Two Stages</h3>
<p>— Mingtao</p>
<p>Some say that actors are crazy and playgoers are fools. Because the former treat the false drama as true, sometimes crying and sometimes laughing, acting like they have mental problems; while the latter treat the false drama as true, praising its "subtle and wonderful" qualities, and following the actors' weeping and laughing. In essence, they are both seeing the false as true, so the "philosophers" who are above mundane affairs judge them to be a madman and a fool.</p>
<p>Only when the audience enters the illusion of the stage in the theater can they gradually hide their reason, forget the environment they are in, and step by step move away from cleverness and wisdom, being stirred up by the dramatic effect. Only at this time are they willing to fool themselves by treating the false drama as true, even shedding tears as if they were facing sadness and joy in real life. But after leaving the theater, they absolutely refuse to admit that the plot of the drama that just moved them is "life." Their reason is right: "After all, this is just a play." And these audience members who wake up after the play are still inevitably seen as "fools," which is really unfair compared to the kind of audience we will talk about later.</p>
<p>A certain newspaper reported that the authorities, in view of the fact that the plots of Peking operas and spoken dramas in Shanghai recently mostly take the theme of satirizing, exposing, and impoverishing reality, which is enough to shake people's hearts, have consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban them.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, in our country, there is still such a group of audience members who are "faithful" to the drama, even when they leave the theater, and even when a basin of cold water is poured on them, completely calming their minds, they still stubbornly refuse to withdraw from the illusion of the stage, desperately "biting" the drama and shouting: "That's life, not a play! The leper clown on the stage is clearly alluding to me. The Qingyi next to him is singing 'light, bright, electric rod.' It's clear she deliberately made up lyrics to satirize me because she clearly knows I'm watching the play below."</p>
<p>I believe that it is useless to simply prohibit dramas with "satire" and "exposure" from being performed on the "drama stage." If on the "stage of life" there are more ruthless "satire" and "exposure" "events" (different from "plays") "happening" (different from "performing"), because it is only a conditional replica.</p>
<p>Only by stopping the occurrence of "events" can the reflection of plays be avoided. People spend most of their time living in real society, so they often watch the "plays" on the "stage of life," and the plots displayed here are even more satirical and exposed. How can they be "prohibited"?</p>

<p>The other day, this newspaper had an exclusive interview with Shanghai County, the first section of which said: "Although Shanghai County is closely adjacent to Shanghai City, in any respect, it is still stuck in a backward stage like ordinary towns in the interior." The title of this article specifically pointed out that when the old and new county magistrates of this small Shanghai County were replaced, there was only 300,000 yuan left in cash.</p>
<p>As far as we know, any city or town that Shanghai people call the countryside is in the same situation as small Shanghai County: backward, and if there is a change of old and new county magistrates, the cash will not exceed 300,000 yuan. The so-called countryside actually includes all the large and small cities along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and even eastern and western Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu, and even Suzhou and Hangzhou, which are known as paradise, are no exception.</p>
<p>Prosperity is concentrated in Shanghai, and outside Shanghai is poverty and backwardness. To explain the reasons for this畸形 development, it may take a lot of reasons, but the mere fact of this distortion is enough to make us vigilant. Now people in the interior are rushing to Shanghai, not for political and military reasons, but simply to earn more money. The income of the same person in Shanghai is about ten times higher than what he can get in the countryside. Because Shanghai has businesses, and the countryside has only a few places to eat. In Shanghai, he can speculate or work hard (taking on multiple jobs) to earn some money, while in the countryside he has no place to use his talents and can only stay hungry.</p>
<p>The number of unemployed people in Shanghai is gradually increasing, while the countryside is threatened by a lack of talent. Whether it is the political, academic, or business circles, all need excellent talents, but suffer from the inability to recruit them. As a result, the already stagnant interior is even more backward. However, it takes considerable courage to return to the countryside now. The wife of a county magistrate in a large county has to come out to teach in order to make a living, and the wife of a section chief has a large patch on her chest and walks on the street to buy groceries. This kind of spirit is admirable, but how many people in Shanghai are willing to go back and suffer this hardship?</p>
<p>Shanghai's prosperity cannot be an ivory tower; it must be built on a revitalized countryside. But who will revitalize the countryside?</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Hot Springs and Grass Mountain</h3>
<p>— Lu Ming</p>
<p>Taiwan's climate is the crystallization of spring and summer, so with the exception of summer from March to September, the remaining half is all spring. Taiwan cannot talk about winter, nor can it find autumn.</p>
<p>Even strictly speaking, Taiwan's spring should come before February.</p>
<p>I would now like to introduce a tour of Taiwan's hot spring areas. If you have traveled to Taiwan, I think you must have visited Taiwan's hot spring areas, Grass Mountain and Beitou. The former is quiet and elegant, while the latter is full of bustling images, even with some vulgarity, so I love the former.</p>
<p>Grass Mountain is more than 700 meters above sea level, and it is very cool even in summer, so it is no exaggeration to say that she is "eternally youthful." She faces Guanyin Mountain, which resembles the head of Guanyin lying in nature. It is too beautiful, and one can only describe its beauty by experiencing it firsthand. And Guanghan's paddy fields, overlooking Taipei from afar, give one a feeling of being in heaven on earth. The warm climate makes people feel lazy, and a bath in the hot springs makes people feel refreshed. Walking in the evergreen small garden wearing a bathrobe, how many places in China can enjoy this?</p>
<p>And what is even more worth mentioning is that it is by no means something that only rich people can enjoy. She is very accessible to the common people. You can wander around here for a day for less than one or two hundred Taiwan dollars.</p>
<h3>A Look at Taiwan's Transportation</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I recently returned to Shanghai from Taiwan because I had some business to attend to. Every day, I had to take the tram and bus several times. Seeing the crowded and chaotic conditions on Shanghai's trams, I couldn't help but think of the orderly situation on Taiwan's buses. Therefore, I would like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to present the methods used on Taiwan's buses to the Shanghai transportation authorities as a reference for improvement.</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<p>(1) Tickets are not sold on the bus. There is a ticket office at each stop. These ticket offices are not specially established but are of an agency nature. Their rights and obligations are similar to the method of selling stamps and revenue stamps.</p>
<p>(2) Passengers board the bus with a ticket and hand the ticket to the ticket collector at the door for inspection. The ticket collector tears off the ticket stub and returns it to the passenger before boarding the bus (similar to the ticket collection method at movie theaters, but without receiving snacks). When getting off the bus, passengers hand the ticket to the ticket collector for cancellation.</p>
<p>(3) The fare is uniform, regardless of distance or route. Passengers can buy a booklet to carry with them and use it at any time, which is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>The above methods have many advantages, such as:</p>
<p>(1) It can reduce the trouble of the ticket conductor tearing tickets and making change.</p>
<p>(2) It can reduce the hardship of the ticket seller being squeezed among the passengers and, at the same time, reduce the opportunity for petty theft.</p>
<p>(3) After passengers board the bus, they no longer need to prepare to take out money to buy tickets, etc., and can buy tickets calmly at the ticket office before boarding the bus.</p>
<p>(4) If it is enforced that no boarding is allowed without a ticket (in Taiwan, even military and police personnel must buy half-price tickets), then the ticket inspection system can be abolished.</p>
<p>(5) The uniformity of the fare simplifies matters for both passengers and the company, which is self-evident. However, in Shanghai, there may be problems due to the multiple companies involved. But if unified management is implemented, this will not be a problem. These are my humble opinions. I wish you all the best!</p>

<h3>This Time's Symphony</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra is scheduled to give a public performance at the Lyceum Theatre on April 27th (Sunday) at 5:00 PM. This is their first performance after reorganization, so I made a special trip to visit Professor Dai Cuilun—the host of the orchestra and also the president of the Conservatory of Music—who took some time out of his busy schedule to talk with me.</p>
<p>Originally, the position of president of the Conservatory of Music could not be held concurrently, but Mayor Wu believed that Shanghai could not be without such an orchestra, and cultural facilities were especially indispensable. Before there was a way to allow Mr. Dai to hold both positions, the mayor was very troubled. Finally, the mayor resolutely handed the Municipal Symphony Orchestra over to the city's Conservatory of Music for management, and the problem was solved. This is the process before the reorganization.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where funds are lacking, the orchestra's operating expenses are naturally very small. Through Mr. Dai's efforts, he managed to invite several outstanding musicians from Shanghai to help. Roughly half are Chinese and half are foreigners. Their remuneration is pitifully small, but they know that this is a mission, not a matter of pay.</p>
<p>The performance program this time is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Overture "Coriolano" by Beethoven</p>
<p>(2) First Suite by Respighi</p>
<p>A. Ballad of Count Orlando</p>
<p>B. Ancient Airs and Dances</p>
<p>C. Masques</p>
<p>(3) Symphony No. 39 by Mozart</p>
<p>A. Adagio—Allegro in E-flat major</p>
<p>B. Andante con moto</p>
<p>C. Menuetto—Allegro</p>
<p>D. Finale—Allegro</p>
<p>(4) Elegy (String Ensemble) by Elgar</p>
<p>(5) Irish Air Selection "Londonderry Air"</p>
<p>(6) Shepherd's Call by Grainger</p>
<p>Conductor: Professor Fu Hua.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Red Blood Splashed on the White Mountains and Black Waters</h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident," the enemy's acts of aggression in the Northeast are truly too numerous to record. To have those of us who have suffered persecution record those aggressive atrocities should be how truthful and profound. However, in "Red Blood Splashed on the White Mountains and Black Waters," the director has brought the audience an empty and illusory story. He did not expose the enemy's sinister rule policies, nor did he depict the painful lives of the people under oppression, but only constructed the center of the story with a love triangle between several young men and women. The male protagonist in the play, Huang Zhigang, is nothing more than an individual hero. He relies on his passionate impulse to assassinate the enemy several times. In fact, in Harbin under the strict rule of the enemy, a person like him could not exist solely on his impulsiveness. The most ridiculous thing is the prison break scene. Two Chinese youths, only having changed into the uniforms of the enemy's military police captain, can rampage and do whatever they want in the enemy's military police team. This is completely below common sense.</p>
<p>Obviously, the director of "Red Blood Splashed on the White Mountains and Black Waters" was influenced by "Casablanca," but compared to the latter, it seems much weaker. In fact, on the Northeast land under enemy rule, countless people's blood is splattered red on the white mountains and black waters. In order to resist the atrocities of aggression, they are fighting fiercely with the enemy. He does not touch these glorious historical facts, but turns around to pick up those love triangle themes, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>The director Liu Guoquan's handling of the play seems very disorganized. The editing of scenes and shots has irreparable problems. This is the director's misunderstanding and misuse of "montage."</p>
<p>Among the actors, Wei Heling's Huang Zhigang, although without special achievement, has very solid acting skills. Lin Jing's female doctor and Ruan Fei's dancer are too weak. Xiang Kun's Dr. Chen is the best in the whole play. The transformation process after the secret report is a particularly rare gain.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>When Zhu Zhaonian whistled and pushed open the school gate to walk in, Feifei and Rong'er were playing on the seesaw in the playground; Feifei's face was flushed like a persimmon, and little Rong was covered in sweat.</p>
<p>"You're whistling that tune again! It's not nice! It's not nice!" Feifei shouted at him from afar in a spoiled manner.</p>
<p>Little Rong rolled over, got up from the sand, and ran anxiously and happily to greet him, shouting all the way:</p>
<p>"Uncle Zhu, candy! Candy! Candy!"</p>
<p>At this moment, Old Zhu couldn't linger with them any longer. He casually reached into his pocket, took out two candies for Little Rong, and ran three steps at a time into the big classroom where Lan and the children lived.</p>
<p>Lan was folding clothes that had just been washed and dried.</p>
<p>"There's a glimmer of hope!" Zhu Zhaonian said breathlessly, "It's Jin Aili who helped. The old Zhu guy agreed to take one."</p>
<p>Lan, who was always more composed than anyone else, couldn't help but glance at Old Zhu in astonishment, but she didn't interrupt to ask.</p>
<p>"This is certainly a very difficult thing." Old Zhu also understood her psychology. "But I think with the news so tight, and cars so difficult to find, it's really not easy for you to take two children to escape. It's good to be able to have them take one of them for you. Now the question is, which one should go with them first, Feifei or Little Rong?"</p>
<p>This was indeed a big problem. Zhu Zhaonian had no opinion to offer at all, because he knew too little about Jue Wen's family affairs; Lan, although she was very rational and had her own opinions, couldn't help but have many concerns when faced with such a thing.</p>
<p>In the end, she decided to let Feifei go first in Assistant Zhu's chartered car, because Feifei was older and it would be easier for Jin Aili to take care of her.</p>
<p>Lan began to distribute the luggage, and Old Zhu helped her pack the heavier things; just then, Feifei and Little Rong came in.</p>
<p>"Mom! Are we leaving again today?" Feifei asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"No, you go first alone. Go with Aunt Jin and them!" Lan told her gently.</p>
<p>"What about you?" Feifei was a little confused.</p>
<p>"Your brother and I will leave later because there is no car..."</p>
<p>"No! No! I won't go either! I want to go with you!" She jumped into Lan's arms and hugged her mother's legs tightly. (43)</p>
