<h3>無許可證輸入貨物政府決以外匯收購　貨款共分六期三年付淸</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十四日常電〕政務會議十四日通過「無許可證自備外匯到埠及起運貨物處理辦法」，原文如下:無許可證自備外匯到埠及起運貨物處理辦法，　凡無許可證之自備外匯貨品，不在禁止輸入之列，巳經到埠或在本年八月十六日以前由國外起遝，且經遵令登記者，應依本辦法處理之，上項貨品在入月十六日以後至九月卅日止由國外起運者，准予提供證件，補行登記。　前條所稱之貨物，除附表一及三甲內之機　及設備品之由用戶自行付款者外，均由政府收購，以央行發行之三年特種外幣存輩付給貨款，此項外幣存輩每六個月到期六分之一，到期存單得由進口商持向央行調換購取許可輸入貨品之外匯，經輪出入管理委會之准許，到期存單得轉讓於登記合格之進口商向央行照市價匯率兌換法幣。　此項貨品之估價，包括:甲，起岸價格，以外幣存單支付之，乙，卸運費用及到埠以後之棧租以法幣支付之，丙，外加購貨成本百分之十（照起岸價格按市價匯率折算），以法幣支付之。　此項貨品，應按照起運日期之先後，分別處理。</p>
<h3>政府出售收購貨品以直接用戶為原則</h3>
<p>今後無證進口貨品一律沒收</p>
<p>此項貨品應由政府出售，其原則如下：甲，原料品為棉花。羊毛等，與有關工業洽商出售，乙·由中信局委託及監督普通之商業機構出會，原進口商行得受優先考慮慮。丙。以上辦法均不適宜時，由中信局自行出售或公開標賣。丁·此項貨品以售予直接用戶為原則，其售價以市價為準，但如為工業原料，其售予工廠之價格，得為起岸價格加以若干成數，工廠所得原料，應作為各該單位應得限額之一部，戊·此項貨品出售之詳細辦法另訂之。　進口商之不願履行上列條件者，須於六十日內將貨品重運出口　本辦法施行細則，由輸出入管理委會規定之，政院除將上項辦法通過外，幷決議：。凡已到埠之汽車，其中卡車部份應照本辦法管理，至限額以外之小汽車，應不准進口。又決定，以後凡無許可證之進口貨品，以走私論，一律沒收。</p>
<h3>董顯光發表談話　自備外滙貨品處理辦法係衡人情法理並非強迫</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕政院新開局長董顯光，為自備外匯到埠及起運貨品處理辦法，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>查無許可證自備外匯到埠及起運貨品照登記金額計算，約合美金四千萬元，未經許可不得進口，為管理貿易之要點，此項規定一經破壞，則管理貿易之精神完全喪失，加以外貨在國內售價之高，已屬過份，進口商獲得過份利益，且售貨所得之法幣，若再流入外匯黑市，其影響所及，更非淺鮮，政府對於此案，博採各方意見，故銜人情法理，因有本日政院通過之無許可證自備外匯到埠及起運貨物處理辦法之決定，其要點；　此項物資雖由政府收購，仍以外幣支付購價，而予以特衙外幣存單，此項存單到期，本息仍可以換購許可輸入貨品之外匯。貨物佔價照起岸價格計算，並另加卞分之一，仍照收購付款時當日牌價折合法幣付給，至一切棧租費用，另由政府以國幣代為償付，是商人不但本利有舊，而幣值亦有保障。　貨品中屬於附表一及三田之機器及設備品之山用戶自行付款者，不在收購之列。此外，貨品仍以售予有關之工業，而工業原料售與工廠之價格，得為起岸價格的加著千成數，其所得原料，作為工廠應得詎額之一部，即工廠有優先承購此項貨物之權利，且得到合理之購價。　政府出售此項物齋，原進口商得受優先代為經理出售，是進口商行之利益仍爲顧到。　為勉循各同業公會之請求，貨物在八月十六日以後至九月卅日止由國外起運者，准予提供證件，補行登記之進口商之不顧履行上項條例者，得將貨品實運出口，故對於此項貨品之處理，並非含有强迫性質，要之，此項辦法之用意，在於一面維持政府法令，同時限止刺激外匯黑市，一面顧到商民血本，工廠需要及進口商之地位。</p>

<h3>無證貨物的處理辦法</h3>
<p>關於自備外匯的進口貨物，即無許可瞪的進口貨物，其處理辦法，業經昨日行政院政務會議議決：凡準許進口之舶來品，由政府照原價以定期外匯收購，禁止入口之舶來品，依例不准入口。共詳細辦法，截至本文屬稿時尚未見到。這項處理辦法是否完全允當，自為另一問題:但政府能快刀斬亂麻，不再遲回審顧，確是目前一般人所切望的事。</p>
<p>是項貨物的總值，言人人殊·最少的估計，共值美金三千萬元，最高至一憶元，而多數以為常在美金七千萬元左右:即照現在官價折合法幣，其數已在四萬億之譜。似此鉅額的物資，如任其呆擱關棧，不予利用，其於一般國民經濟上之損失為何如？其於進口商人之直接間接的損失又何如？况據市商會等十餘團體所稱：「此項進口貨，十之六七為工業原料及必需物品，十之一二為工業器材」，而此等原料及器材，又無疑地正為國內所極需要的物品，何怪工商界要再三呼籲，訊求解決呢？</p>
<p>上面這兩項處理原則，是當局經過長時間的考慮，而後始行提會議決的。不論其所定條件如何，是否為各該進口商人所歡迎，原則上當不易再有變更。所以最值得考慮的，是如何收購這一點。第一，政府收購究採用何等價格？原始的進價呢？當地的市價呢？還是根據進價，再加上種種開支和所謂合法利潤？如照市價收購，又是何時的市價？此項進口貨，種數既不同，到埠又有先後，其種種開支，在政府方面，有沒有確切的資料可資依據？現在政府既決定照原價收購，問題似乎較少了一些，但有實行收購的時候，預料還不免有種問題，須要加以適當的解決。</p>
<p>第二，是收購價款如何結算，卽是付現呢？還是記帳？如果一槪記帳，暫不付現，商人的吃虧，未免太大；而一律付結現款，則資額太鉅，似乎也成問題。而且此項貨物，是用所謂「自備外滙」買來的，究應仍以外匯償付呢？還是折付法幣？照政府的立塲來說，原可給予法幣，而且可照官價折合，但進口商因此所受的暗耗必大，目前政府既決定照外匯在三年中分六期給付，而更予以合理的利潤，設想尚稱周到。惟分期給付外匯是否還加上利息呢？這仍然應加注意。</p>
<p>第三，是收購以後如何處置？其惟一的辦法。當然是變賣。但實行變賣時，又有幾個問題要發生：　為直接記售與有關廠商，抑不定對象，公開標實？　倘採用配售辦法，其配價如何規定？是否一律照本發售，抑照市價稍加折扣？抑照成本酌加利潤？共利潤又以何者為標準？　於收購後即行整批變賈，抑尚須看市面的需要如何，陸續出售？</p>
<p>以上這許多問題，都是由收購時所連帶發生，而有若干不能不急待分別解決的。如果解決不當，並且要發生種種反饗，可能地影饗到政府信譽的，所以都應該愼重考慮。我們以為一槪收購，原是政府不得已的辦法，將來一切措置，總須力求持平，不要使商入過於吃虧，更不要從中另打算盤，謀取意外的高利，方可得到一般人的諒解。</p>
<p>至於禁止入口之舶來品，依例不准入口，這原是極正當的辦法。不過按照現時情形，這些不准入口的貨物，很可能地繞道重來，改取走私的途徑，代替了報關上稅的合法手續。政府如果一退了事，不採取其他有效的手段，則無異促進走私，徒使海關損失了大宗的稅款。所以這兩項處理辦法，其實施細目如何，實有精密擬訂之必要。</p>

<h3>蔣夫人演詞</h3>
<p>（上接一版）蔣夫人演說謂：今晚得與各位聚目一堂，並且代表中國婦女界，向各位表示歡迎之意，本人覺得萬分愉快。世界女靑年會此次選擇中國為舉行大會的地點，我們很為榮幸。</p>
<p>成就廣大</p>
<p>當我接到貴會請柬的時候，我起初本想應當讓一位參與女靑年會日常工作，而與青年會關係更密切的人，來致歡迎詞。可是女青年會之在我國，其成就之廣大，遠過於會員的人數，它代表著一種精神與社會力量，深深感動了中國的女同胞，靑年會對於改善世界，實有輝煌的貢獻，本人乃為股切關懷着世界改善問題之一人，所以架於接受這個機會，代表中國女同胞，來向獻身於發揚此）世界偉大運動的在座各位代表，表示我們誠摯的敬意。各位此次來到中國，它正經過了八年慘酷艱辛的戰爭，因為物資上的困難，我們給各位的招待不免簡陋，但這決不能减少我們微迎的至誠，各位明知中國物炎便利的不足，仍選定這裏為開會地點，尤其使我們獲得很大的感慰。</p>
<p>女靑年會對於我木人，實有密切的關係。多年以前，那時我還未會結婚，剛從美國學成歸來，我很榮辛地與上海女淸年會發生了聯緊，那時我是女靑年會工業委員會的志願服務督，現在回想起來，當時的徑騐，對於我一生實有很大的啟示作用，我對於社會問題，本來很有興趣，但從那時起，使我對於工廠的童工與女工問題，開始特別的注意起來，上海工部局之設立童工委會，一部分實由工業來委會努力的成果，而目前中國的工廠法，也頗受該會的影饗，這就是女靑年會工作在社會上發生作用的一個實例。</p>
<p>在我看來，中國各大城市，杭州實在最適於選擇為貴會的開會地點了。杭州為中國許多最有意義的城市之一，不僅它有舉世聞名的優美風景，且富有歴史意義約古蹟。</p>
<p>偉大女性</p>
<p>中國歷史上有兩位偉大女性，她們的名字，與杭州有密切關係，道對於我們此次的集會，尤有值得注意的意義。</p>
<p>假使你們要問巾國歷史上最著名的女性有誰，我想三尺孩童都會回答你，岳母與秋瑾，這兩位不朽女性，與杭州歷史有難解難分的關係。</p>
<p>岳飛為宋代抵抗金人侵略的愛國軍人，其忠骸即卜葬於杭州，凡來杭州遊覽的人，莫不到岳墓虔誠憑弔。他忠勇地為國捐驅，而他一生赤忱愛國的精神，乃得自腎母之敎，岳母在岳飛幼時，在他背上刺了「精忠報國」四字，她給中國造成了一位流芳萬世的民族英雄。</p>
<p>從近代來說，杭州又為革命女烈士秋瑾的埋骨之地。秋瑾為現代巾國最前進的女性，他為了贊現解放民族及男女平等的理想，學生不斷奮鬥，卒作崇高的犧牲，人人都尊崇她為革命的偉大先烈之一。</p>
<p>中國歷史上這兩位祟高人物，都埋湘於杭州，我希望各位能抽暇一訪他們的陵基。</p>
<p>但是杭州之對於此集會，其所以富有特殊的意義，還有一個更直接的理由。</p>
<p>因為中國女靑年會最初量在五十七年前杭州的一個敎會女校創始的，當時創始女靑年會的主動人物，就是現在美國駐華大使司徒雷登先生的太夫人，和畢範宇先生的太夫人。司徒太夫人也下葬在杭州，希望大家趁此次開會之便，也能去一訪她的墳墓，表示我們對於這位偉大基督徒的敬意。巾國女青年會的運動，自在杭州首創以後，就風起云湧，到了現在，已經遍佈全國各地了。</p>
<p>創造歷史</p>
<p>我常常喜歡回想過去的偉人，但是今天創造歷史的任務，都已落在我們的肩上了。</p>
<p>各位代表從二十三個不同的國家，不遠千萬里而來，你們代表着一支强大的世界力量，可以為促進國際間更完美的秩序而努力。你們代表全世界的婦女說出他們良心中所要說的話，在這個充滿了不安和徬徨的時代裏，貴會替世界各國懷有善意的婦女們確定了一個集中力量的機會。世界各地正有不少分散孤單的仁人志士，在祈求國際的和平與諒解，貴會給他們提供了一個聯合一致的中心組織。我們要知道，世界正念迫期待着爭取和平的英勇領導啊！世界女青年會公平無私，不講利害，不分國界，富有祟高的理想，同時深知精神對於社會的價值和力量，正能夠給世界婦女以這一種的領導。</p>
<p>現在許多人的心中，明叫有前一幅世界前途的美麗遠景，但因自身內在的弱點，却不能以行動來使理想成為現實。</p>
<p>去除障碍</p>
<p>我現在更加相信，阻止人類享受美好世界秩序的障碍，多半還是在人們自己的心中，如果我們要想擭得行動的意志和勇氣，必先去除我們內在的障碍。</p>
<p>我以為第一個必須去除的心理障碍是猜疑。國家和國家間，民族和民族間，因為惡毒的猜疑而隔關，在懷疑與不信的氛圍之巾，合作就不會生存的了。</p>
<p>第二個心理障礙，是我們不相信人性的本善。我知道在我們這個時代，一個人都把墮落與腐敗歸咎於人類的本性，這一派的人，還有一大套似是而非的證據，辯護他們的主張，試問假使我們以人性本惡的前提出發，我們如何能够希望將來世界的美好呢？我們之中，凡是並未失去以道德統治世界的理想的人們，必須摒棄這現種人性本惡的失敗主義觀</p>
<p>第三，現在頗有一些人，對於他們應該稱極奮門的糧種。採取漢不相關的態度，以致所有的力量，沒有動員起來，他們徒有遠大的理想，但缺乏改善世界的意志，他們寗願消極的隨波逐流，任人擺佈，結果為歷史所遺棄。假使我們已從第二次世界大戰得到一些敎訓的話，這個敎訓，就是經過流血與痛苦的證明，凡屬缺乏熱情的民族，等於自已去招致色權主義的凌侵，唯有我們願意為實現一個更好的世界而努力工作，我們方始有達成理想的可能。</p>
<p>新的感悟</p>
<p>我深深瞭解，一切造福人羣的努力中間，難免失望與挫折，我們的理想往往比實際的成就為高，我們盼望立時得到偉大成就，但當希望不能達到的時候，我們對於常前的工作，不免感到沮喪。然而空想輕易成功是一種極大的謬見，人生最大的成就，在起初看來在往像是一定失敗的，這種經騐，我在不久以前，得到了新的感悟。</p>
<p>我最近在上海的時候，曾到靑浦的余山旅行，那是一個風景優美的地方，從山脚上去，有一段綿長的石級山路，再從半山到山頂，共有十四個轉灣，我們或者可以稱之為四個小小站頭，每站都有一個鐵製的神　，銘刻着耶穌基警前往耶路撒冷郊外受難的全部歷程，在每一個受難碑上面，都刻着有關敎義的文字，指示我們對於耶穌受難歴程中每一階段所應該學習的敎訓，再上去最後就到了余山頂峰，那裹矗立着一座莊嚴華麗的天主堂，集十字架意義之大成，也是人類受難與博愛的業徵。</p>
<p>這真是一種富於啟示意義的景象，然而對於不熟悉基督故事的人們，這十四個受難碑，不過昭示了以十字架為終點的整個失敗，從這種人的觀點看來，似乎基督的任務，結果遭受了不能避免的災難，可是我們知道基督的事榮，是歷史上最大成就之一，我們也知道，這個世界所以能從野變或比野蠻更壞的現象中超脫起來，並且得到拯救，就是由於茲督的犧牲精神，和被釘在十字架的那種巡難事蹟。基督的偉大訓論：「愛你的鄰人如同愛你自己」！是引導我們的一盞明燈，而使我們在今日世界護得了希望。</p>
<p>我們不能為暫時的成功所蒙義，也不能為目前的失敗而沮喪，假使我們認為我們是對的，我們必須勇往直前，不必因代價或犧牲之巨面感到氣綏。</p>
<p>神聖戰鬥</p>
<p>在這個戰後的大時代，女靑年會及其他類似的組織，在矛盾而受戰爭摧殘的世界裏，爭取着道德的價值，現在正面對一個艱困的戰鬥，但這是一個神聖的戰門，我們必需用內在的信仰和志向來支持，必須戰勝暫時的失敗與幻滅，我們對於世界的前途，必須抱有不屈不撓的信心。</p>
<p>中國曾經在一個似乎被人忘懷了它奮鬥的世界里，但是他始終抱着一個信念，就是只依靠養這像鐵一般的「正義」來支持，在如此無望之中，年復一年，繼續不斷地奪鬥下去。我們中國人深切瞭解這一種鬥爭的涵義，我們領會到這一種鬥爭所給我們的內在深厚的力量，是怎樣的使我們獲得了酬報。</p>
<p>在這個戰後世界裏，我們中國人所渴望的目樑，也就是世界女靑年會所爭取的國際秩序。在此一戰鬥的過程中，我們大家可以精誠合作，共同努力。我相信明日開幕的世界女靑年會大會，將是這種戰鬥中的實要一役，貴會在中國的杭州舉行，我們實在感到光榮。（完）</p>
<h3>反對開放內河</h3>
<p>（上接一版）蓋英國自十六世紀伊麗沙白女王以來，既以航業立國發展海行航運，乃至在其他國家領水範圍以內，從事內河及沿海航行，為其一貫之國策，故從前淸道光廿二年巾英南京條約，以至光緒廿八年中英馬凱條約之一連串的不平等條約，無不以爭取航行特權為主旨，而英商怡和·太古等洋行，亦努力配合其國策，喧賓奪主，在巾國內河及沿海航行七十餘年，以致中國幼稚之航業受其壓迫，始終不能抬頭。我人深望英國訪華團，對於過去若干人士，因重視航行特權及航行利益而形成之誤解，加以糾正，幷促成英國政府根據民國卅六年一月十一日由英所訂關於取消英國在華治外法權及處理有關問題條約之精神締訂甲英友好通商航海條約，以促進兩國之邦交與商務之發展。</p>

<h3>波蘭行第七信　鐵簾背後社會浮相　寂寞的波蘭人（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>波蘭在歐洲國際舞台上，永遠是一個扮演悲劇的脚色，第二次世界人戰的歐洲部份，從波蘭的厄運開始。還記得，當年倫敎唐寗街十號，那位　懦無能的老翁尼微爾。張伯倫。曾經擅抖地宜稱過，大英帝國為履行英波條約而戰，為保障波蘭的領土完整，主權獨立而戰。但是，大戰打完了，波蘭喪失了九百萬生靈，波蘭也失去了七萬七千平方公里的領土。也許，到今天，許多英國人一講起波蘭，內心會隱隱感到慚愧。在羅斯福總統逝世以前，某次自宮記者招待會上，有位記者問到:「總統對於俄國要求割讓波籣領土，有什麼感想？」總明如羅斯編總統，一時也為之木然，他沉凝了半饗，深沉地回答了一旬：「我對於中國蔣委員長，宣佈對泰國並無領土野心一點，衷心異常地敬個。」</p>
<p>有人說：羅斯福總統是為了波蘭的所謂「卡松綫」糾紛「氣」死的，也許道樣的設法未免過份，但是在今天，二千三百萬波蘭人的心目中，（除了一部份波蘭共產黨以外），為了卡松綫，使他們失去了十八萬一千五百平方公里的東部領土，無論如何，是他們一個不可磨滅的搶疤。在這塊靑腴的土地上，原來有三百萬波蘭人，世世代代居佳在那裏，據波蘭內政部的負責人說：現在已經有一百五十萬人，被送回到波蘭西部來，還有一百五十萬人，在陸續被遣送的途中。</p>
<p>「失之東隅，收之桑槍！」在德黑籣會議中，「巨頭」們間意了波關從籌國取回十萬四千五百平方公里的土地，那就是所謂鄂得河流域，以及半個東並曇土和但澤走廊。共產黨在波蘭大吹特吹，說這是「蘇俄友邦」的盛情，說是：蘇俄幫助了波蘭「收復失土」。在華沙街頭的標語壁報，乃至於雜誌刊物上，你隨時可以看到一幅波蘭西部新疆界的地間，但是，很少有總書出東部的「新國界」的。</p>
<p>波蘭人稱這一塊得自德意志的土地，呌做「收復區」，在內閣裹，特別設置了一個「收復區行政部」，部長是今天波蘭天字第一號的「紅人」戈墨卡，波共的巾央需記長，內閣副總理，他同時也是波蘭收復區的行政總督。</p>
<p>我會見收復區行政部的波蘭朋友，他說:收復區的重要意義，不盡單是為波開人收復了「失土」，而且為世界奠定了和平的踏脚石，因為鄂得河上游的西里西亞，本來是德國軍火工業的中心，專普魯士是德意志「軍國主義」想望的孕育地，現在由彼蘭取償過來，無異澈頭澈尾解除了嗜戰成性的德國人的武裝。</p>
<p>他說:收復區裹在戰前居留着七百萬德國人，八十萬波蘭人，到一九四五年納粹無條件投降時，德國人祗剩了二百萬，現在，彼蘭難民以及從卡松綫以東遺送回來的波蘭人，都紛紛搬進了「收復區」，波籣政府按月負責運出一千二百至二千名德國人，令他們向西走，自謀生路。</p>
<p>由於這次戰爭所造成的「人為的」人口大遷移，產生了歐洲歷史上罕見的奇蹟。在紐約的時候，我讀過美國駐西班牙前任大使海目斯敎授寫的「民族主義論文集」，記得其中有一章，他讓到許多解決民族問題的辦法，他提到了許多「强迫遷徒」的厯史悲劇，以及由悲劇產生的不堪設想的後果，他說：歴史上若干次戰爭是這樣來的，彼此問亙亙不絕的「收復失土」，製造了不少民族間的　殺。</p>
<p>我不是預言家，我也不干預言波蘭新護得的「收復區」，二十年，三十年以後，會產生什麼惡果。至少，目前的波蘭當軸者，他們是不會，也不願想到這此的，我在華沙的逗留期間，和很多彼蘭人接觸，我覺得波蘭的老百姓倒是頂可愛的，除了酷哨酗酒一點以外，大部份的波蘭人，都保有一種農衆人社會的淳樸，天眞，和坦率</p>
<p>但是，環境造成波籣許多錯綜複雜的國際際關係，使許多西歐人，美國人，乃至於中國人，不滿意，甚至咀咒波蘭的大政和國策。去年我在美國，聽聯合國安全理事會開會，盡管波蘭代表渥斯加郎（中文譯作蘭社）的英文如何流利，講話如何婉轉，旁聽人總對波關的能聯度有一種「反感」，中國人尤其永遠不會忘記日內瓦舊國聯時代的柏克外長，那個典型的「助紂為虐」的國際政客。</p>
<p>柏克外長活躍在波蘭的縣蘇斯基晚年時代，波蘭朋友們說：畢蘇斯基在早年時代，會經流亡在日本，那時侯，波蘭在俄普奧三國瓜分時代，日本常局對畢蘇斯基非常優禮，而且在一九一九年凡爾饗和會席上，替舉蘇斯基的「復國運動」撑腰，當年舉蘇斯華的「親日」，原本不想故意「讎華」。後來德國崛起，舉蘇斯基為了傳統的「反俄」，晚年來遂至助紂為虐，不能自拔。（未完）</p>

<h3>列强一致去持分治計劃　聖地流血勢難避免　蘇代表建議修改阿猶疆界</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕國務院人士預料英軍退出巴勒斯坦後，聖地之流血爲不可避免，自蘇聯表示支持分治後，分治已成必然之事，而阿拉伯世界之以武力反抗及阿拉伯國之不惜退出聯合國，殆已在意料中。與英代表國接近之人士認為蘇聯表示之能度，殊使阿拉伯國失望，諸强對此一問題之意見，幾已趨於一致，而猶阿關係已近破裂，預料若千阿拉伯極端份子極可能自由行動。</p>
<p>聯大巴勒斯坦委會定今日標準時間下午二時，在成功湖討論下列問題：　猶阿國界；　英國交出委治及撤兵日期；　過渡期間之當局。又該委會將建議不派任何外國軍隊赴巴勒斯坦，僅責成猶阿民團維持秩序。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十三日電〕蘇聯在今日發表之重要政策聲明中，贊同巴勒斯坦之分治原則。蘇聯係在巴勒斯坦特委會宣佈此項立塲，此尚爲本屆聯大會中，蘇美對重要問題基本趨於意見一致之第一次。惟蘇聯雖則贊同分治之觀點，但反對日內瓦聯合國調查委會所劃分之國界，蘇聯暗示隨後將宣佈特別修正案，蘇聯正與美國然未正確說明聖地之分治究如何實施。在此以前，蘇聯曾主張該計劃如屬可行，則可成立一阿猶聯邦，但十三日蘇聯代表泰拉普金稱，在目前阿猶關係極度緊張之情形下，此項聯邦顯難以實施。蘇聯又要求英國對巴勒斯坦之委任統治，應儘速結束，蘇代表團要求聯大會在實施分治時，協議產生一統治巴勒斯坦之行政機構，此項機構應對聯合國負責。蘇聯呼籲解決巴勒斯坦問題，應從廣泛政治基礎上着手。</p>
<p>美代表詹森對報界宣稱，「吾人對於蘇聯之聲明，寄以極大興趣。該國在此項基本問題上，與吾人意見不謀而合，甚爲欣慰。」代表巴勒斯坦之猶太公會，亦大爲歡迎此項政策宣佈，認爲「係蘇聯政策之必然的與一貫的發展」。</p>
<h3>阿集團堅決把對聖地建立猶太國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社叙京貝魯特十三日電」阿拉伯聯盟領導人物，定於十四日舉行會議，討論美國分治巴勒斯坦之主張。據悉，各代表深感美國雖希望對聯合國調查團之多數報告，能作「若干地理上之修改」，而阿人對此，將無動於中。沙地阿拉伯代表葉欣告訪員稱，「此係原則而非細則之問題，英人竭力反對設立猶太國，絕無討價還價之餘地」。伊拉克總理耶勃告記者稱，「請直率通知美國人，巴勒斯坦之分治將造成麻煩及困難。吾人意想不到美國竟有此一舉，實在惡劣之至」。阿拉伯各代表對於如英國一旦撤退而將行政權交付國際警備隊，阿人將否採取武斷行動之可能性，拒作推測。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十四日電〕據悉，英國已嚴厲警告阿拉伯國家稱，實行阿聯盟之決議，在巴勒斯坦邊境結集軍隊，勢將引起嚴重後果。英國幷以聖地十萬英軍，將對任何阿拉伯在聖地之叛動採取嚴峻步驟爲威脅，蓋英國仍負責維持該地秩序。此間僉信，英國之不贊同，乃消除阿拉伯進軍聖地計劃之最有効武器，蓋大部份阿拉伯國家之正規軍，皆仰賴英國大量武器及軍官之協助也。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷十三日電〕猶太國民委會主席李米斯稱，巴勒斯坦北部之猶太區，已有增援部隊開到，預防被攻。渠並宣布巴勒斯坦猶太人每人每月應捐新一日，作爲保護猶太區之經費。</p>
<p>〔路透社外約但首邑亞曼十三日電〕外約但總理李夫希今夜否認阿拉伯國陳兵巴勒斯坦邊界之說。謂此舉有損阿拉伯原則。不論阿聯盟採取何種決議，但在英軍退出巴勒斯坦前，決不執行。外約但王阿杜拉今日歡迎阿拉伯聯盟之二十一位代表，回敎主赫賽尼並不在內。</p>
<h3>美代表促速成立「小型大會」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十四日廣播，成功湖訊，美代表杜勒斯今日在聯大政委會中發表演說，主張從速成立五十五國之「常務委員會，」俾給予聯合國機精以新的活力。杜氏否認蘇方所稱此舉旨在推翻安理會，並謂該委會在進行工作時，仍受安理會之約束。杜氏在發表演說後，曾以橄欖樹枝一技給予蘇代表，並稱，「希望各國能對美國之建議提出建設性之修正。」按杜氏曾被蘇方稱爲「戰爭販子」者。</p>
<h3>對美議員訪歐團　蘇聯施抨擊　決饗以閉門羹</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕莫斯斯電台評稱：美國議員二百餘人，已向歐洲發動傎正之侵入，此非偶然的旅行，此等議員團甚至具有軍事方式之配備，包括各軍事部門之代表，美議員有願進入蘇聯者，但蘇聯以國主權爲重，不願成爲令人可疑的調查之目標已予謝絕。</p>
<p>〔路透社大馬色十三日電〕美議員團由共和黨議員梅洛率領，今日抵此考察，今夜將謁敍利亞總統柯利。</p>
<p>〔路透社報告達十三日電〕由於伊拉克政府及人民抗議美國去持聖地分治，美議員團明日抵報達時，將不復為正式訪問僅為非正式之訪問。</p>
<h3>希臘問題辯論吿結束　蘇聯對案遭否決　維辛斯基爲共產國際辯護</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖十三日電〕聯合國政委會今日完成關於希臘與其北鄰三國糾紛之討論，否決蘇聯議案。先是政委會於週六通過美方建議，由聯大設置特委會監視爭端區域，並設法改善已爾幹四國之爭端，美方建議現將提交大會討論，以便採取適當行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖十三日電〕英代表麥克尼爾在聯大政委會中，鄭重否認英國有威脅南保希獨立之意。渠答覆烏克蘭代表曼紐斯基之指責，指其為不負責的指摘。今日之會議中，斯拉夫國代表發言最多，蘇代表維辛斯基爲其所提之決議案力事辯護，蘇決議案將巴爾幹動亂之全部責任歸諸希臘政府，並要求外國軍隊撇出希臘，及設立聯合國委員會以監督美國予希之援助，英美法等國對此一決議案堅決反對。在辯論時，麥克尼爾所稱「曼紐斯基對於英工黨領袖之指摘，顯示共產國際業已恢復」之語，引起維辛斯基之反駁。維氏稱，「由於九國共黨之在華沙開會，你們已發生夢覺，但事實上並無共產國際，共產國際之會員決不止九國，僅有九國已使你們惶恐不安，何不吃一點藥以鎭定你們的恐懼」。蘇聯決議案之整個部份，經以四十票對六票被否決，棄權者十一票。決議案之第一部，即以巴爾幹動亂責任歸諸希臘之部份，以卅九對七票被否決，棄權者十票。第二部要求外國軍隊撤退之部，以卅三對八票被否決，棄權者十六票。第三部設立委員會監督美國援希之部，以卅五對六票被否決，棄權者十六票。</p>

<h3>羅馬巿政選舉　反共各黨獲勝</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十四日廣播：羅馬訊，羅爲市政選舉已接近尾聲，各黨派競爭劇烈。反對共黨各黨派目前計獲全部票數中之百分六十七·九。左翼陣綫壓倒基督民主黨之加斯貝利，多獲四千三百十九票，但此非左翼陣綫獲得勝利之謂。左翼陣綫與民主黨在市政議會中均獲二十七席，其餘二十六席則爲其他反共黨派所獲得。</p>
<h3>美政府首要雲集白宮　杜魯門聽取報吿　澈底檢討歐洲當前局勢</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十三日電〕高級官員一行，本日向杜魯門總統呈遞直接觀察西歐情形之報告。此項報告與美國對歐洲經濟復興之計劃有關。在白宮會議中，總統聽取關於經濟與政治方面之口頭報道。提供報道者爲駐英大使陶格拉斯，駐蘇大使史密斯，德境美佔領區軍事總督克萊將軍，克萊之顧問墨飛，及副國務卿克萊頓。代理國務卿洛維特及進出口銀行與貨物貸款公司職員等亦在塲，聆取最近由歐返國各官員之意見。</p>
<p>稍後，國務卿馬歇爾及其他閣員在白宮與總統同進午膳。白宮新開秘書稱：美國援助經濟資源問題之克魯格委員會所擬就之報告，巳於上週呈遞與總統，現正由總統加以研究。此項報告將於本星期向內閣閣員及國會議負分發。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十三日電〕杜魯門總統今日在白宮召集高級政治外交要員談話，是乃總統對歐洲局勢最澈底之審查。關係方面謂，下列問題均曾予以討論：　迄今所採步驟，均不能使法義得以適當資金，以支付必需之美元區輸入，故應審查利用進出口銀行及物品貸款銀團所握資金，以供緊急用途之可能性；　澈底檢討蘇聯在歐洲所施行之政策。美駐蘇大使史密斯及甫自歐洲歸來之財長史奈德，副國務卿克萊頓，常能以極珍貴情報供給杜魯門，俾得據以擬具針對九國共產國際情報局之對策；　檢討緊急糧食計劃，美官方承認，糧食計劃形勢不佳，茍不另採措施，將使出口糧食不能不减少。</p>
<h3>重開巴黎會議　英國深表反對</h3>
<p>白宮匆遽召議，與美國馬歇爾計劃官員及巴黎十六國經濟合作委員會執委會之會談，可謂不期而合。權威方面謂。英國對於美國建議重開巴黎會議，以通過美國對巴黎會議報告書所提修正意見之議，深表反對。英代表弗朗克斯爵士認爲援歐計團之最後決定權操諸美國國會，故先行獲取歐洲國家對美政府修正意見之同意，似屬不智亦不必要云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十三日電〕美進出口銀行十三日採取行動，允准法國挪用一億八千萬元美國款項，購買美國煤斤及其他急需之原料，以緩和西歐危機。該項借款乃一九四六年五月貸法六億五千萬元借款剩下之未動用部份，經法駐美大使龐奈向杜魯門總統作緊急呼籲後，乃准挪用。法國採購機關業已簽訂合同，將全部款項用於重機器方面，以振興法國之出口業。至於依新規定法國所能得到援助之確實數目，端賴其中若干合同之取消或延長而定。杜魯門總統上月發表法義在馬歇爾計劃實施前，今冬將採取權宜之援助，此次爲美政府之行政部門予歐洲之第一批款項。</p>

<h3>日人要求歸還大琉球島　參院決暫予擱置　細川建議由該島居民自行解決</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十四日電〕日參院外交委會刻議決將大琉球島居民所請求將該島仍歸還與日本之微妙事件，暫予擱置，俟聆取該島人民有更多之意見後，再行處決。</p>
<p>投該島居民六十三人，籲請該島仍歸還日本，日本參院外交委會之第二次激烈爭辯，若干議員認爲此事極爲微妙，故應舉行秘密會議。但參院議長前日駐蘇大使佐菔尚武反對上項建議，而認爲諸參議員在討論此一微妙之問題時、必能採審愼之態度。該會中之共黨議員細川嘉六則堅强反對討論此案，渠謂：歷史上可證明大琉球島係日本於明治四年至十二年間竊得者。渠並稱：大琉球島之首長，係被迫而非自願與日本歸併者。按細川為日本名評論家，渠認為六十三名大琉球島居民之請求，不足代表該島在全球一百二十萬人民之意見，甚至不足代表該島廿萬名在日人民之意見。渠繼稱：若干該島人民贊成該島與日本合併，但亦有若干該島人民贊成與中國合併，以此，渠建議此事由該島人民自行處決，而日本參院不必過問此事。佐藤議長則自會議之始，即設法防止對此事作嚴重之辯論，故渠旋即宣佈暫行擱置此項問題，俟自該島居民獲得列多之意見後，再行處置之。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕越劇元老派名伶筱丹桂，前日下午突在北京時時宋家弄家巾自殺，詳情已誌昨報。筱伶遺體，於昨晨二時，自巾美醫院昇送騐屍所，上午入時，經警局報請檢察處派員騐屍，九時始將遺體昇往樂問殯儀館，定明日午舉行大殮。昨日自午至暮，規友弔唁者極衆，尤以金市越劇迷觀衆對塲瞻仰遣容。絡繹不絕。越劇十大紅伶，除尹挂芳於上月赴外，袁掌芬，范瑞娟，傳全香，徐天紅，張桂鳳，與筱樓，竺水娟，徐王蘭，均先後到國祭奠，撫屍大慟。並有筱伶昔年配角張湘鄉。及越伶賈靈鳳，筱靈鳳，徐絮琴，陳佩香，魏關芳，白牡丹，高務芳，彼小樓，筱月娥等，無不掩面吸泣。筱伶遺體原定今日大殮，惟因其家屬，須待其兄錢伯權來滬主持，故延至明日舉行，靈前由其妹瓊韻守孝，悽聲吸泣，其夫張春帆，據記者探悉，昨午在殯儀館內，神經有失常現象。全市越伶，對筱伶自殺原因，均覺懷疑，認為必有電屈，有向各界諸請伸爭之舉。全市越伶將於明日一體停演，舉加筱伶大殮儀式，以資哀悼。所謂越劇元老派五旦，即施銀花，曹瑞花，王杏花，姚水娟，及筱伶。且筱靑出於藍，為越伶所推崇，故有三花不如一娟，一娟不及一桂之稱，可見筱之地位。昨日各方對筱伶自殺原因，揣測紛紜，有稱因今夏黃金十大紅伶聯合演出「山河　」一劇，筱之成績稍聯，為人物議。而受刺激，又謂因國泰越劇院之樓牆坍落，影憲會業，更有因徐玉蘭之拆擋，而使筱伶抑　寡歡，更有謂筱被管太嚴，因之喪失自由者，至於經濟困難，猶屬其次云。</p>

<p>迪蘭失蹤機　殘骸在性愛嘉峪關西北善中尋獲女記者史蒂芬等已全部羅難　　〔本報關州五日航訊〕今年七月三十日，軍用變C17-257一米架，自迪化起機，到哈密降落加油後，因爲天氣不好而休息了一夜。次日下午二時，繼續東飛，二小時後掠過疏勒河，航行在三千公尺至五千公尺之開，突然，一陣飆風當頭旋過，這架飛機便與地面失去聯絡，宣告失蹤。兩三天後，當局才透露這個惡耗，當時僅知道裕乘該機的有廿一人，並未公佈乘客名單，但據各方證實新無省黨部謝書紀長永存，美國「時代」記者石蒂芬小姐，我國淸年名書家幹樂然先生，確是搭靈此機飛講　　鴻飛冥冥　　在以後的兩個月中，有關當局會派了飛機四出尋找，並由　北地方政府和駐軍協同偵負，結果是「鴻飛冥冥」，不但找不到殘骸，而且遲下落也沒有。入月廿六日南京空軍總部公佈了失事經過，並全部靈客的名單，使人們心上蒙上一層陰影。一天一天的過去了，報紙上常常用現些不能體實的消息，有一家報竟披露了失事飛機在明水灘尋獲的消息，使失事者的家屬和友好，會因之寄於眞大的希皂，希望有一個奇　，他們能無恙的歸來！　　美金賞格　　九月初，西北行賴主任張治中將軍，接受美記者石蒂芬小姐的母親的請託，憑賞尋覓在蒂芬小姐的下洛，賞格是美金一千元，張氏九月八日飛京途經嘉峪關時，曾飭駐酒泉的二十三師司令部佈告　賞，「美金」在河西老百姓的心目中還是個陌生的名詞，一時揣測紛紜，但對飛機失事的下洛，仍舊毫無裨益。　　殘骸發現　　九月卅日，此間西北行較突然接到肅北阿金拉蒙旂駐酒泉辦事處張主任的電報，報告這架飛機隊于洛在嘉峪關西北山中，地名玉澄，殘骸業已發現，其詳細情形尚不可知，但眞相己經大白，全部乘客和機師的罹難，也已證實了。　　異國孤魂　　在這全部罹難的乘客中，與記者有一面之緣的是石蒂芬小姐，去年九月間，她來籣州時，相遇於籣州市長孫汝楠先生的招待會上，得知她過去會在業美國新開處工作，勝利後，代表「時代」雜誌和法國通訊社旅行我國，操着異國語言，隻身旅行於平，津，滬，漢，渝，蓉等地，到西北後，又去過青海，她到新彊之後，決意到伊梨去一觀究竟，新疆軍事當局因無法保障她的安全竭力阻止，但她終於偷偷地搭「黃魚」車去留險了。據記者所知，她是外國記者第一個去伊犁的，（某國當然除外）她那種不避艱險的大無畏精神，實在令人欽佩，如今做了異國的孤魂，子然徜徉於祁連山的邊幕，她還在太平洋彼岸的老母聽到這個堊耗之後，該是如何的悲痛啊！　　靑年書家　　另一個韓樂然先生，隸籍東北，在法國學盡很入，歸國後，一直在西北工作，所以和記者有很深厚的友誼。甘肅敦煌莫高窟，渝林窟的古代壁書，他都下過很大的工夫來臨幕，西北各地的山水風物，他更動描繪，所以他的作品多的不可勝計。克利浦斯夫人聘華來蘭的時候，看到他的作品，極口稱贊　　考古工作　　近一二年，他對考古工作又發生很濃厚的興趣，西北文化建設協會聘為理事，開始在新疆展開了發掘的工作，先後在古高昌國遺址，（吐譽番）略什，庫車，馬嘗，等地作書，考古，常在荒沙無垠，渺無人烟的地區工作許多天，佛洞裹特別精彩的部份，他除臨幕下來之外，業設法保護原績。在許多古墓的發掘中，發現了很多有關我國文史的資料，他說在古高昌國的發墟裹，還發現過兩具黃頭髮的木乃伊。　　去年，于院長右任在新疆見到他後，對他這種工作很多的獎勵和鼓勵，並隨于院長回蘭過冬，準備從事於次年的大量發掘。　　造物忌才　　今年二月下旬。他帶了兩個助手和五個學生，以及一應的器材，由蘭州搭汽車啓程，三月十二日到達迪化，因爲當時吐魯番正在叛亂，即取拜城的克孜爾千佛洞工作，沿途又發現幾處古城遺續，都未及挖掘。到古　爾千佛洞工作了兩月一餘，因器材將完，需回蘭補充，他便帶了所有的收穫，搭機東飛，此此過難，這些寗貴收穫的喪失尚在其次，最可扼　的便是韓君本人的不幸！　　像他那樣活力沛充的熱情磅　一的年靑（三十餘歲）藝術家，眞有無限信心和宏願的人，一旦遇難，價使人感到「造物忌才」的一悲哀！（通訊員宋鱗）在失綜飛機中遇難之美籍女記者石蒂芬遺像。遇難後，渠在美之母親會一度懸賞徵詢愛女下落。（本報通訊員宋麟寄）在西北熟心工作之藝術家韓樂然君，不辛亦在失綜機內慘遭犧牲。圖示：韓君去冬在蘭州之英姿。（本報通訊員宋鱗寄）納粹獨髮　　向西北試探被遣送北平　　〔本報蘭州五日航訊〕頃據本報記者自有關方面獲悉：納椊之觸　，曾向西北方面試探，現已為地方常局偵悉，還送赴北平。緣有德籍人白禮生及胡瓦，奧籍人提希等三人，月前由北平經滬來蘭，白禮生及提希下榻西北大廈，胡瓦則寄居小溝頭天主堂，旋以作家身份遊歷靑海及塔爾寺，並擬赴西藏旅行，經靑海省常局阻止後返蘭。此問治安當局，頃奉上舉電令，以渠等為納粹嫌疑份中，均在遺送回國之列，特筋限制其活動，現已由甘省警察局發給護照，勒令自蘭州乘牛皮筏赴寗夏·包頭·轉往北平築中，聽命遣送。配合局勢　蘇省府　電令各縣警局飭屬編隊訓練　　〔本報蘇州十四口電〕蘇省府為適應時局，特他令各縣警局，節將所屬各局隊長警隨時集中編隊訓練，加强戰鬥力量，以策應緊急事變。　　〔又電〕蘇城防部以時屆冬防，且匪共騷擾，無孔勿入，特決定每晚十二時後出入城門，行人必須查對國民身份證。凡行縱可疑者，准許隨時拘捕，在必要時並得宣佈戒嚴，籍以確保治安。前臺省商會會長林熊徵：一筆鉅額遺產稅組審委會辦理產業調差工作　　（本報台北九日訊﹞前台省商會長華南銀行董事長林熊徽的遺產糾紛，甫告平息，遺產稅又或為台北市民的話題。林熊微（薇閣）是不請日語台語的福州台灣人，母親是淸太傳陳竇琛之妹，早歲隨父在轉師范學堂議書，後與盛宣懷的五小姐　　盛官頣　　結婚，因患腸痿，三四年就告離婚。伊母去世時，遣屬胞姪林衝道爲嗣子在。戰前林氏往來滬台，專做砂糖和牛奶買賣，發了大財。後來又到日本，　識日婦高賀千惠子，（現卅餘鐵），帶回一固小孩「明成」到台灣，去冬十一月，林氏患腦盜血暴斃，五日後，這個小孩使取得了戶籍，而其離婚妻盛官頗，（現五十餘歲），也帶了女兒「林昭宜」，（廿七歲）　　從美國　　趕回上海，請了七入個律師抵台進備訴訟，二·二八時返滬，最近又回了來。　　林氏遺有鉅產的數字，只有死者肚裹明白，因為他並沒打算五十餘歲死。據去年十一月廿九日死時的統計：五千甲的土地，房產已在台幣八億元以上。（現在當不止此數），當時會由親友決定均分：日婦二分，盛婦一分，五千甲田一部充作學由，供給每年三個留美學生的貴用。可是出人意外地，林死後有個本省婦人帶了十二歲的小孩來聲稱：曾與林發生過關係，要求析產。　　遺產稅　　省中當局注意林氏遣產，更注意可能抽取百分之六的特組審查委會將其財產調查估價，日內發出查定通知書，如有異識，於士五日內可以提出。其中百分之九十五將聯省庫，百分之五市府希望作爲代徽的市府建設費用。據估計，這筆遺產稅不僅是台省最鉅額者，也將是勝利後全國遺產稅中的最大一筆！　　光復以來，台省因發力不足，戶籍登記沒辦好，很多遺產稅都漏綢逃避，目前全省民衆都眼睜着遣光與後的第一筆稅金，能真賣地充作省市財庫收入，不致再釀成另一個糾紛。（特派員江暮雲）蘇北各災區決減免糧賦　收穫未滿熟年一成者全免　　〔本報泰興十二日訊〕〔糧食部對本年度蘇北受畢水蟲災等區域，已決定减免田糧完賦辦法，以示體卹。蘇省田糧處頃令各縣府關於减免田賦成數，依熟年收成總收穫量為準則，凡災區本年收穫未滿熟年一成者，田賦可獲全免，三成以上未滿三成者，准免十分之八，三成以上未達四成者，准免十分之六，五成以上未達六成者准免十分之五，六成以上者不予减免。常熟實施宵禁　　〔本報常熟十三日訊〕此間淸訓指揮部，為確保地方治安，防範匪徒滋擾，定十五日起嚴格實施　禁，子夜十二時以後，絕到不准通行，城關一律閉鎖，以重防務。錫全城戶口定期總淸查　　〔本報無錫十三日訊〕本邑軍政當局，以冬防將屆，為確保地方治安起見，前經縣府治安座談會決定，於本月十五日起實施全城戶口總普查，由憲兵團，驚察局，自衛隊，會同組織調查組，依警區分為五區進行。虞逆侖案兇手周慰祖仍處死　　〔本報蘇州十四日電〕虞殺嬸逆倫案兇手周慰祖，今經蘇高院裁定，上訴駁回，周慰祖仍處死刑。漢奸張敬止落綱　　〔本報杭縣十日訊〕曾任偽上海地方法院刑庭庭長之張運椊（敬止），勝利後會一度逃往蘇北匪區匿跡，近忽驟返原籍杭縣塘棲鎮，日間匿居於勞守淸家中，深夜時出活動，卒於九日被警問拘捕。今解送縣政府轉送法院懲辦，以彰國法。通緝孫育才逆產監查中　　〔本報蘇州十四日電〕偽江蘇省建設應長孫逆育才，勝利後畏罪潛逃，業經蘇高院命令通緝。茲蘇高檢處於十四日農傅訊有關證人，監查逆產。鹽阜旅通同鄉會設立難民收容所　　〔本報南通十四日電〕鑒阜旅通間鄉會，為收容鹽阜隨軍撤退之雜民，特組設難民收容所，供二餐一宿，如須至滬者，並予免致搭轉。唐閘實驗區將迅予成立　　〔本報南通十四日電〕唐閘劃爲實騐區，一波三折，前臨參會第四次大會議決緩設，縣府頃舉省令亟應迅速成立，縣府巳遵令進行一切。榮敎院舞弊案調查工作完竣　鐘監察談內幕複雜促主犯林一自首　　〔本報無錫十二口訊〕駐錫榮軍第十一敎臺院前巾校總務主任　林一，少校軍需主任雲天驥，上尉軍需何理等三人，因吞沒榮軍各項　勞品。暨配給物資，並挪用公款，剋扣薪餉伙食費等，共十餘億元，以擴充私人事業，如經營業館，火梗片廠，錢莊，信用合作社，藥行，布廠，旅社等，各情已誌本報。頃據鍾監察官語記者：斯案內幕深為複雜，一時尚難具體發表眞相，党犯在錫濫收生徒，招謠過市，則確有之，餘則尚未有精密之調差，次來純係調差事實，對案犯之制裁，則靜待國家法律處決，最後並希望黨犯自首，以明責任，十四日晨，種氏尚有要案二件，赴常州調差當晚即返錫，不久即可返京覆命。平湖地方法院下月一日成立　　〔本報平湖十二日訊〕本縣司法處改設地方法院、原定明年元旦正式成立，茲悉：浙高院爲適應環境需要，決提前於十一月一日成立，院長一席由業洪充任，首席檢察官為李戰彭。袖珍新聞　　閔行　　〔本報訊〕上海縣參議會一屆三次大會，定十九日至二十一日開會，刻正在微集各界提案，並編製議程。　　松江　　〔本報訊〕城區全市鮮肉業，因平價肉購買者浚無申限制，　耗甚鉅，因之自動停業已逾半月。茲由縣參會社會科等調停結果，決將因價每市斤增為二萬元，各隊部平優肉照市價六折計算，並由軍民合作社　制購買數字，憑票發售，鮮肉業方面已予接受，於十二日起全市復業。　　金山　　〔本報訊〕縣民衆自衛總隊部，奉令編組直屬中隊，分爲三分隊，在朱溼，張堰，呂巷等三鄉鎮集中訓練，眼於十五日成立究竣。又：浦南汽車自十二日起，各錢票價已予調整：計金山至松江全程二萬元。　　明光　　〔本報訊〕明光軍警聯合稽查處，頃奉命實行戒嚴，於十二日起，佈告週知。　　江都　　〔本報訊〕蘇省各縣市銀行第五次聯誼會，於十二日在揚舉行，計出席泰縣周以仕等二十二單位，共三十人，尚有南匯，松江，靑浦，嘉定，太倉，溧水等六縣代表未及趕到出席。決定全省各縣市銀行通匯詳細辦法等要案，並決定下次大會在鎮江舉行。　　常熟　　〔本報訊〕京滬國道，現正由交通部積極部署興建，按照照原定計劃，必須經過邑境。該部公路總局，特派第一國道測最隊來處，於十三日起展開測丈工作。　　海寗　　〔本報訊〕農林部牧畜實驗所浙江綿羊繁殖塲，定於本月十五日上午在塲地舉行成立典禮，浙省嘉區各縣及省建設應，農業推廣所均將派員前來參加。　　紹興　　〔本報訊〕浙省府爲厲行禁煙，於日前特派民政窺視察丁國動來紹，抽查本縣辦理禁政情形。丁氏定十四日離紹，轉往餘姚等縣調查，又聞丁氏此次抽查，特別注意於煙民黑單。</p>

<p>春秋法國的散文詩  徐仲年　　大家知道法文是很美的語文：文字本身很細膩，富有音樂性，文法又很嚴密，叙述異常精確。這樣的文字和詩意配合起來，即使不用詩律，也極容易寫成散文詩或詩意的散文。這其問，有一個小小的分別：「散文詩」自始至終是一首詩，只不過用散文寫出而已；「詩意的散文」是文章中的一節，在這一節裘，音節之美和意境之美巧合，於是詩味盎然。在法國，兩者都很富饒，最近方纔有位學者莫烈斯。夏伯蘭（Ｍaurice　Chapelain）刋行了一部「散文詩選」（Anthologie　du　poeme　en　prose）彌補了百年來有散文詩而無選集的缺憾。　　一般文史家承認散文詩創始於一八四八年出版阿洛瓦西禹斯·貝爾脫安（Aloysius　Bertrand）所著的「黑夜的賈斯巴爾」迄今一百年。在這一百年裘，散文詩非常發達。夏伯蘭道二「這個晚來的詩種，在肥土裏剛出芽，便猛烈長大，有如肉瘤那麼兇；它終於密密地蓋住了它的不規則的　鬚，幾乎把花園中以「法國式子」培植已久而且仔細培植的其它花卉都窒息了。」我們應當感謝夏伯蘭：他採摘這些「法國式子」的「晚來詩種」，組成一束奇美異艷的花束！　　可是，法國散文詩最初的源流遠在「黑夜的買斯巴爾」之前：它的初源簡直和法語的初源合而爲一。法語的祖先分成兩支：一支把「是」字讀成「烏以兒」；另一支把「是」字讀成「惡克」：在言語史上，前者稱「鳥以兒語」；後者稱「惡克語」。用烏以兒語譯成的「聖經」可以當作法國散文詩的胚胎。此後，十五世紀，有那部受神秘派拉丁文影響很重的「密傳」（Initiaiion）：有修辭家的作品；有在一五五九年出版的約克。阿米烏（Jacques　Amyot)所繙譯希臘歷史家「勃呂達克的作品」這部繙譯非常成功，辭句與內容均美。此後，佛郞素瓦·杜·沙兒（Francois　de　Sales：一五六七——一六二二），勒·梅脫爾·杜·薩西（Louis　Issac　Le　Maistre　de　Sacy:一六一三——六八四），卜懦愛（Bossuet：一六二七——一七○四），拉·勃呂埃爾）Jean　La　Bruyere：六四五——六九六）等等，這批散文家，於不知不覺之間成了散文討入。而，爲了敎導太子，費納龍（Fenelon:一六五一——一七一五），根據了荷馬與魏亦琪兒的史詩，寫下了光芒萬丈的「書蕾馬克」（Telemaquue）.　　然而，從拉辛（Jean　Racine）發表他的悲劇傑作「雅達型」（Athalie，一六九一）起直到詩人顯尼埃（Andre　Chenier)的遺集出版爲止，其問一百廿八年脫了腔:不但沒有詩化的散文　，而且正是夏伯蘭在「導言」巾所云：「詩也變作冷冷無生氣的散文」了。幸而物極必返，從路易卞五朝到帝國崩潰，詩化的散文如雨後春筍，到處皆是。浪漫主義的前夜，這種散文更爲興盛：進一步的「散文詩」該是瓜熟蒂落誕生的時候了。　　「黑夜的賈斯巴爾」的作者阿洛瓦西禺斯，貝爾脫安確是一位天才。他在這部傑作的題目之下加了一個副題：「慕倣杭勃朗和费洛的隨筆一。杭勃朗是十七世紀荷闌大畫家，賈洛是十六世紀法國畫家：二人創作力之强，想像之豐富，色調之優美，世莫與京，貝爾脫安慕倣他們的手法，運用到散文上來：自負不凡，而他的才力恰足以赴之。在「自序」中，作者認承創造「和聲上與色彩上的種種新方法」。果眞，集中每簾文章都經過長時間的訓練，不同凡響，集詩化散文之大成，開散文詩之大道。其後，「惡之華」的作者波特萊爾發表了一部「散文小詩」：在法國散文詩域裏，其重要性等於孟十之繼孔子。其後，佼佼者有居伽斯（Ducasse）及蘭普（Rimbaud），直到當代詩人：若各勃（Max　Jacob），法爾葛（Leon-Poul　Fargue），米休（HenryMichaux）；最後這三位，第一一位以古怪勝，第二位叙述家常事物而出奇不可提漢，第三位則善說無理中的論理。　　這部「散文詩選」搜羅名著甚富。約略翻閱，以A字打頭的作家有：阿蘭·福爾尼埃（Alao　Fournier）·阿普里耐爾（GAoolhinaire），何拉貢（Lous　Aragon當代），阿爾都（Antonin　Artaud）等等；以B字打一頭的作家有波特萊爾，貝爾脫安，勃魯懷（Leon　Bloy　，近代），卜斯顯爾（Jean　de　Bosehere），勃爾東（Andre　Breton，當代），插入諸人中最年輕的貝一雅呂（Marcel　Bealu，生於一；八）；以九C字打頭的作家有賈爾古（Francis　Carco當代），克羅苔兒（Paul　Claudel，常代），克羅（Charles　Cros）以D字類則有：特羅烏（PauDrouot，）居拉斯（IsldoreDulasse　Conte　de　lautreamont）等等……。集中健存的作者除上述者外：尙有，法爾萬·傳蘭（Jean　Follain）以及這位文字淸麗如處子而我最近繙譯他的中法戀愛小說「浦尙夫人的情遇」（Aventure　de　Therese　Beauchamp）的米島曼特爾（Ｆrancis　de　Miomaedre）。眞是洋洋乎大觀！高念東的欲曲  子振　　元人小令流行以後，淺淫日盛，遂成明代民間流行的「時曲」。就「野獲編」，「客座贅語」等書所載，可見當時流行的盛况。那時的散曲作者，也多模擬「時曲」的作品，劉效祖的鎖南校，馮夢龍的掛枝兒，都是模仿民問流行歌曲而作。著名的要算李開先和趙南星二人：李開先輯有「市井　詞」；趙南星「芳茹園樂府」，有不少的擬作。錢謙益「列朝詩築」丁集十一趙南星小傳說他：　　「……更爲長歌小詞，庾語，吳歌，打臺竿之類以戲侮之……」　　按令通行的盧校排印本「淸都散客二種」的「芳茹國樂府」中，只有劈破王，一口氣，喜連聲，鎖南枝半插羅江怨，却沒有打棗竿和吳歌。聞北平　因百先生有雍正鈔本，較排印本多三十餘闋，不知有無這兩種曲調。除趙氏外，明淸之際也有不少的擬作者，高念東便是其中之一。尤侗「百末詞餘」卷六跋文云:　　「高邑趙　鶴冢宰，一代正人也。予於梁宗伯（按即梁淸標）處見其所填歌曲，乃雜取村謠俚　，耍弄打　，以洩其骯髒不平之氣。近高念東侍郞亦復爲之。」　　按高氏作俗曲的事，又見於他的友人蒲松齡的詩文。蒲氏「聊齋文集」卷上「祭高念柬少宰文」說:　　「業文心，尤闡宗義。降摩尼於兜率之天，散空花於璃之地，直欲使苦海澄波，　燈照世。窩勸懲於便謠，皆慈悲之妙諦。」　　又「聊　詩集」卷下「輓怠東高先生」三首之一云：　　「痛想當年羣業人，俚歌亦足破徵塵；文章易稿從容就，口不探音表裏眞。綠野堂中蕉鹿夢，碧蓮花上宰官身。瞻鳥爰止於淮屋，俛仰黃爐涕滿巾。」　　蒲氏詩文中所指的「俚謠」，「俚歌」。當即尤侗所說的「亦復爲之」的俗曲了。　　按高氏名珩，字葱　，號念東，晚號紫震道人，山東淄川人，明崇禎十六年進士，入淸官至刑部侍郞，康熙三十六年丁丑（一六九七）卒。撰有「梄雲閣詩」十六卷，趙執信輯。又「拾遺」三卷，宋弼輯。「四庫全書總目提要」卷一百八十一著錄高氏詩集，謂「其詩多率意而成，故往往近元白長慶集體。』高氏詩集流傳不廣，故未能一檢。推想起來，詩集中也似乎不曾搜羅擬作的俗曲在內。但不知人間尙存高氏的小曲否？　　和高念東同時，也有不少俗曲的擬作者。蒲松齡有牌子曲「幸雲曲」「蓬萊宴」等八種，牌子戲「磨難曲」，「牆頭記」，「　妬咒」三種。廣川韓允嘉「毅貽山房集」有醉太平，邊關調等俗曲。這些可以說明：從明中葉起的擬作俗曲的風氣，到淸代康熙間流風還未泯滅。高氏的擬作，也只是這主流的一些浪花而已。口哨  童建人　　是凉爽的深秋之夜。　　微風輕輕地盪漾，半圓的月光，投在公園的每個角落襄，像少女披上了輕紗。池塘裏枯殘的荷葉，似碎裂了一團簇錦，四周靜悄悄地。秋的氣息在空中迂迴着，恬靜中帶着幾分悽凉。　　像一個尋夢的人，我獨步在園地上。　　枯了的梧桐葉，一片片跌落在泥淖襄，鮮嫩的草，已給秋風吹老了。荷池裏沒有蛙呌，祇有草業問輕微的「紡織蟲」的嘆息，給秋夜頻添上了無邊的寂寥。　　我徘徊在曲折的小徑上，池邊得楓樹下；心裏　巢的燕，在般的縹渺，像一隻覆巢的燕，在找尋那失去的無可補償的辛福和玄想。　　天際的月，還是昔日的嫵媚，星星也仍然眨着明亮的眼。　　於是，我緬在甜蜜的回憶裏……　　驀地裏，一聲淸徹的口哨，遠遠地和風送來，是那末熱識而親切，漸漸的散失在銀樣的夜景裏。　　是誰？勾引起我太多的惆悵　　春天裏，也是這個境地，殘缺的月，明亮的星，溫暖的和風……我倆輕步在柔軟的草地上。握住着二顆跳躍的心；挽着顫抖的手；沐浴在春的氛圍巾，是那末洒脫和悠閒地——於是，他輕輕撥雙唇，吹一起嘹亮的口哨來——綺麗狂熱的曲子；是那末輕鬆，活潑，有節奏……多　美的音樂啊！幾次，我陶醉在他的唇音裏，幾次，我幾乎忘記了自己。　　他又來了嗎？在這秋意濃郁的今夜　　懷着一顆祈禱的心，我小心地跟蹤着失去的口哨的餘音；在一個　樣的夢境裏，找尋那消失了的溫情……　　我躑躅在一座石橋的轉角處，一個小水池兩株老大的楓樹，寄生草爬滿了樹幹子，石橋下泉水吱吱地流着，小池裏發出一陣陣爛草爛草的腥臭……曾經在那個泉水旁，我和他消磨了很長的時光，那時他帶着溫馨的微笑，瀟洒的風度，柔聲地吿訴我生命的價値；生活的體驗，事業的創建，前進的展望……在那個角落裏，我領略了不少生命的留戀……同時我更體會到愛情的滋味。　　　　　　　　可是，他的蹤跡呢？　　如今，我孤獨地撫摸着石上的靑苔，我按摩着那昔日他曾倚傍過的欘樹；那失去的夢境啊　　夜色更加濃厚了，四聞像死寂一般，不知幾時園警已立在我的面前，催我離開，於我夜無可奈何中，帶着一個空虛，寂寞，孤獨和一份永遠不會有人了解的悲哀的心，依依地離開了那曾經使我迷惑與狂熱過的園林。雙桂樓近詩　賦呈方達千內舅  呂白華　　昔驚萬山烽，艱難傳尺素；寒門賞遺吾，自公溯三世！（公出唐蔚之尙書長南洋時門下，遜淸之末，來吾鄕敎縣學英文，與先外大父同事。讀余寄先著「新昌呂氏兩代詩文集」，爲增慨云）。簫條任萬轉，臥海情　附；公摘　　奇，通識而遠務。入剡雲在襟，出關艱行路；倣骨不受磷，磊落與時忤！（旋北上任某稅局長，廉介不名一文，亦以是上下遼孚）。江湖一尊酒，浩氣還自御；歸來各歡然，談言寗慳酤！豈無佳子弟，投老又何與？六十甘傭書，曲　聞　　。（公有二子，一商一政，俱能立而疎養，年六十，猶傭貴自給，然泊如也）。白　面猶童，人吝天所助；淸風五炸山，千載倘相遇！一寸山河一寸血  葉勁風　　至於整個姿態，當然更是一個美的型。因爲她是一位東北女兒，又練渦各式運動；在老寨中，還不時歷練游擎，所以美之中還有一個健。普通健美型的女子，多少露着一些粗，或粗壯，或粗糙·甚至健碩；耀羣却是把這健隱在嫻娜優雅之中，只能看得出一點剛來；因這一點剛，所以顯得凜然不可犯；然又並不栽氣騰騰，仍舊是北方女兒一樣的婉　。　　這時耀羣靜靜的坐在靠窗的樓上。雙手合在一起，輕輕地放在一獎柔膝上，姿式十分的文靜。那位「它」，在說話的時候，有時坐着，兩條腿八字大扒開；有時跳來跳去，手舞足蹈，却像鬼怪那樣張牙舞爪，作勢　拏，閉目存想，我們可以想到，這裏有一副畫面：一個魔王，花言巧語地，正在誘騙一個公主，或在欺哄一個天眞爛漫的女兒。還有它那尖裏帶老的嗓子，發盛有如鬼嗥，可惜聲音無法入畫罷了。　　那麼，耀羣老是那麼聽着，這麼寗靜着，端的是個什麼戰略呢？據她自己說，開頭，她確有些驚惶，胆寒，除了鎭靜之外，委實拿不出一個相當應付的辦法來。後來才抓住了它一個弱點，也許它正是自認爲長處的「口若懸河」。旣是口若懸河，所以耀羣規定了一個方略；讓它「一瀉千里」。且等它瀉完了再瞧機會。她採取「以不變御萬變」的戰術。除此以外，您說她應該怎麼辦？　　您得知道，耀羣聽了這一大篇話，却始終捉住這傢伙一個大漏洞：它雖知道認羣和小老虎是幹秘密工作的，却還不知道二人的來路和特殊任務。至於它自己的一方面，雖說它承認是一條惡狗，却始終沒把自己眞底子說明。雖說曾經點明它是玩票的客串性質，稍稍吐露了一點機關，表示它另有作用，另有使命；然而虛虛實實，其中究竟有詐，不是嗎？　　大體說來，像這傢伙把雙方的底子都抖翻了一部分出來，總也算一種「文明」攻勢，至少可以先禮後兵；相較起來，總比日僞特工那種猘犬型的兇暴行動，見面不間情由，就火辣辣地兩個大耳巴子，總要客氣得多。但要曉得，這種表面直率內藏奸詐的玩意，比較猘犬型的兇暴，尤其難於應付。因爲碰着　犬，只須把心一橫，大不了是一個死，本來幹秘密工作，早把生死置之度外，雖死，秘密總可以保守到底。　　可是一旦碰到這種奸猾角色，應付就要困難萬倍。頭一點·它敎你捉摸不定，你說它像左傾，它偏又有些右傾行動。第二，它軟硬不吃，你對它硬，它偏生軟搭搭地死纏，你對它軟，它却棉夷藏釘，讓你感到扎手。任你如何分析，他卻始終是個「微妙」；微妙得近於神秘。峨嵋雲海  陳樹人</p>

<p>推荐「八年離亂」　　一部優秀卓越的　術品，它必然是接近現實，擁抱現實，從而透過了深度的內容去表現它。那決不是那些架空說夢，游離現實的「藝術家」所能做到的。因此這樣的作品，必然爲大衆所喜愛與擁戴。　　「一江春水向東流」的上集「入年離亂」，這樣的題材，已經不知多少次爲電影編導者所搬演過，整不多巳經成了抗戰八股了，但是由於編導者執着現實主義的創作態度，因此在「八年離亂」中，我們所看到的，恰是一個感人至深的故事。它不是抗戰入股，而是生動有力的記錄了八年抗戰中一個平凡的，善良的靈魂的演變，從而反映了這八年離亂中的社會。今天的後果，是從怎樣一條道路發展成的。　　自然一部優秀的電影作品，決不是單靠劇本所能成功的，這裏我們更應該推崇木片的導演演員，技術人員，由於他們的高度合作，才有現在的成績，在國產片貧乏的影壇上，「八年離亂」無疑地是跨前了一步的作品，這樣的作品，決不是這短文所能分析研究的，當另文詳談。這裏　向愛好國產電影的觀衆，誠意推荐這部優秀卓越的「八年離亂」。　李箴自由談關於嗜好  王不陵　　凡有血有肉的人，總是有嗜好的，「嗜好」不足爲害，就要看人們如何運用自己的嗜好？向那一個方向發展自己的嗜好？　　「嗜好」的出發點，是佛洛伊特所說的Libido，「性慾」。『性慾』是生命的活力，決不是一般道學夫子所醜詆的『劣質』。嚴格言之，那些百以爲「聖人之徒」的道學夫子，就是比較的富於這種「劣　」的人，他們不過是把「性慾」起了「昇華」作用，化爲殉道的精神而已！他們要是缺少這種「劣質』，即患着「性慾」的凋殘症，他們還不是一塊極平庸的廢料！「性慾」好比是黑色的炭塊，暗淡無色澤，死硬乏生氣；可是，把它燃燒起來，就能放射燦爛的光輝，照耀自己的人格，使自己朝氣蓬勃，生命充沛，永遠是長春不老的蒼松。「昇華」的「性慾」，用心理學的術語說，就是崇高熱烈的情緖。情緖之河流，脈絡互通，各有歸趨，自然能形成不相類似的嗜好，孔子以之成聖，釋迦以之成佛，耶穌以之成爲人類的救主，等而下之，英雄豪傑以之發展他們的事業，詩人墨客以之創造他們的藝術，……這些人都是端其嗜好，使自己强烈的「性慾」，昇華爲「生命之光」的成功者。莊周會說過這樣的話，「孔子與盜跖在其本質上是不相上下的」。這便是說，他們與生俱米的「性本能」，比誰都熾烈，比誰都豐富，孔子能把蘊藏的炭礦，全部起了昇華作用，蔚成光輝無比的太陽；而盜跖始終把自己的「性慾」，停留在炭礦的狀態，這便是「聖」與「盜」的所由分。設孔子也同盜跖一樣，不知道性昇華的妙諦，那麼，我敢說，孔子也是個殺人越貨，無惡不作的盜跖。　　基於此義，嗜血的橫世魔王如希特軔；莫索里尼之流，同樣是「性慾烈强」不而懂得「性昇華」的人；所以，他們的嗜好，祗是聽「性慾」的指揮，做了「性慾」的奴隸，好色，弄權，愛財，黷武，暴戾，役人，殺人，……如此諸般，都是「性慾」的具體表現，也就是羅素所說的「獸性的衝動。佔有的衝動」。　　誰都渴求滿足「性慾」的；但誰也無法滿足自己的「性慾」，於是「性慾」這東西，不能不變更各種方向去發洩，不能不使它起一點外華的作用。年富力强的小伙子，情愛無處寄托，就憧憬在愛的幻夢裏，成年累月地寫情書，做情詩，自以爲貌美多情的少女們，愛唱歌，演戲，跳舞，拍照，滑冰，游泳，騎馬，坐電影院，尤其樂於模倣時髦的新裝束，在花晨月下，常常對鏡獨窺，顧影自憐；成年人偏愛自己的孩子，又愛到處遊歷，願意獻身　　業，　搞政治；老年人則以抱孫，濯園，種花義魚……來娛樂自己的晚年；有些年靑時頗爲風流的老太太們，就別無出路，祗能念佛燒香，登峨嵋，爬華嚴，來淡忘自己的幽思了。在這裏，我不免要發出好奇的疑問，不知道此刻在銀幕上，舞台上，交際塲中顯過色相的少女們，到自己變爲老太婆的時候，將用什麼方法昇華自己的「性慾」？這一切雖都是性慾的化裝；但已算是從「情緒」出發的比較高尙的嗜好了，較之許多「行屍走肉」的人，自始至終抱定「性慾本位主義」，一切從「性慾」出發，使人生極端單純化，或則不擇手段去發財，發了財，立刻娶上三婢四妾，不顧性命去縱慾，實不知高出幾千萬倍！他們對於性慾的放從，可能感到　間的滿足；然並沒有想到這是上帝的惡作劇，是上帝用一種「慢性自殺」的刑罰，來消滅這些作惡的敗類的，常他們爬上象牙之榻，左擁右抱時，怎知道就是爬上變相的斷頭台呢！　　說實話，嗜好人人都有，沒有嗜好，便是缺乏生命的活屍；但人要善於運用自己的嗜好，無論志於道，或流於邪，萬不可過分專注，醉心入迷，墜入瘋魔狀態。嗜好而能向多方面發展，自己不失却控制力，即不爲嗜好的俘虜，而常能支配嗜好，這才是養生之道，不然，則必爲嗜好所殺害！　　嗜好是隨着生活的富有而擴大的，貧窮的人，老死住在樸質的農村，目不辨五色，口不嘗五味，耳不識五音，終歲勤勞，尙不獲一飽，自然嗜好很小，容易滿足，因此殺害他們的敵人，是兵荒之後的飢荒，決不是自己的嗜好！音樂可以减少兒童犯罪  Olga　Samarof作　溥倫譯　　今日，每個有思想的人類都有一種驚駭的醒悟，就是犯罪的增加，特別是未成年的犯罪，普遍了全世界。　　可能醫治之法的廣泛討論，己夜歷屆敎育會議和公共法庭有了紀錄。但富有經騐的，都認爲防止犯罪的重要力量的一種因素，就是音樂。　　音樂不但能使荒蕪凄凉的心境有慰藉的魔力，而且還能使凄凉的心境轉好歡笑的魔力。這就是防止犯罪最重要者，因爲音樂會誘導那犯罪矛盾的心靈上的情緖和狀態。　　關於音樂力量的事實，可由統計來證明。一九二八年，紐約市中心音樂學校舉行二十五週年紀念，發表一些令人驚異的紀錄：　　「在這個二十世紀四分之一的時代，差不多有三萬個在音樂學校讀過書的人們，未曾犯過罪而進入法庭」。　　時間是不能抹殺這種紀錄的。到了今日，這最初的報吿還是一樣，音樂學校的學生依然永遠沒有犯過罪。　　根據這令人驚異紀錄，我決定去調查出究竟全美國的罪犯，受過音樂敎育的佔百分之幾。　　結果，有百分之八十七的犯人，給我有表格的信所得的答覆：他們當中沒有一個職業音樂家或受過音樂敎育的。　　調查十一個牢獄，祇有四個牢獄有受過音樂敎育的犯人；而這四個牢獄，共有一二，四〇一個犯人，新人牢獄的受過音樂敎育的犯人算是最大的數目—在二，四〇八人中，祇有十九個，佔不到百分之一。在Tollet地方懺悔院，數目更少了，在四，七八七個犯人中，受過音樂敎育的佔不到百分之一。　　從這些犯人中，即可證明音樂與個性之間具有相互的關係。　　南方伊寗諾斯懺悔院院長曾寫着:「受過訓練音樂家不敢犯罪」。　　音樂治療術的概念還沒有新奇的發現，希臘人早就這麼說了。音樂對於個性的重要發展，柏拉圖已經承認了：他在「共和國」一書中寫說：「音樂訓練是比一種任何訓練更有效騐的訓練，因爲音樂與和聲能够找出一條進入靈魂底處的道路；在那裏，它會發生强有力的速度，傳達優美的東西，促成他那受過訓練的靈魂快活，或使悲愁的憂傷起來」。最吝嗇的人  金衛最吝嗇的人—海啻葛琳。　　信不信由你，這位最吝嗇的海啻葛琳曾一度是美國最有錢的女人。她的收入是每分鐘美金五元或每小時三百元。她的遺產至少有六千五百萬美金，或多至一萬萬。　　她經常花二分錢買一份晟報，看過以後還要把它賣去。　　美國所有的鐵路，都有她的份；有兩條路的股票，全部爲她所有；但是她出鬥旅行的時候，整天整夜都坐三等車。她請朋友吃飯，總是在平民食堂裏，吃二角五分錢一客的經濟飯。她自己日常只吃五分錢一餐—三分錢一盤豆子，二分錢一碗雜和湯。她在紐約工鑛銀行裏存着幾百萬現款，所以她常以這銀行作她的家。她買了一輛舊馬車，把車輪取掉，把車廂抬到銀行裏，她就住在裏面。當她年事漸老的時候，竟然發生一件奇跡。一位朋友竟能勸動她花三百塊錢施行美容術。據說每一次手術，可使她看來年靑一年。她八十一歲才逝世，臨危時照顧她的看護不准穿白制服。因爲這位太太假如知道他們是高價的專門看護，她是死不暝目的。科學珍聞  心亘譯　　吸兩支否烟足以損壞我們夜間的視覺，這是美攸醫院查爾士，西德醫生（Dr.Charles　Sheard　of　the　Maxgo　Clinic.所研究的結果。烟草的精華能够中斷眼球網膜血液的流通，而需要十五至三十分鐘的時間才能使自己模糊的視覺復元凶。空軍訓練手册巾因此極力反對在夜間空戰以前吸烟。　　兒童一年之內的生長並不是勻稱的，春季身高增長得較快，平均幾乎比秋季的生長度高二倍，但是春季身體增高而體重並不增加，無論如何，秋季雖然生長很慢，可是那時他們身體却比春季大爲肥胖。　　假若你在冬犬除掉你的帽子，你的脚會惑覺到冷。手和脚是人類身體上最容易感覺寒冷的部份，雖然受寒的是頭部，你的脚却會比頭先感覺到。　　太文学家海頓·普蘭他倫（Hayden　Planetarium日）曾以天文學的觀察描繪出未來宇宙五個不同的悲慘的結局將要發生在地球上，而原子彈的毀滅並不是原因之一。　　五個可能的結局是：　　　日光溫度，突然劇烈增高，以致地球逐漸焦枯萎縮。　　　太陽冷却而使地球成爲凝凍的荒地。　　　地球將成爲一個「無用的旁觀者」，假使太陽被流星擊中而破碎的話。　　　懇星慘烈的擊毀地球。　　　月亮與地球猛撞而同歸於盡。美國小姐  徐菽園　　美國小姐與職業婦女　　由於美國人民的富有自立精神，婦女職業相當發達，幾乎深入各國階級，但美國女子對於政治興趣的淡薄，女子職　限於實利方面，而婦女參政反沒有中國那麼多，你說這是中國女權運動超過美國的明證嗎？常然不是的。美國女子是一般的女子有權，並不是少數特權階級有權，她們一方爭取權利，一方面也襯義務。在抗戰中美國女子從軍的人數極多，陸空軍裏的Wac，海君裏的Spar，在戰爭中盡了極大的犧性，她們是够資格與男子一爭短長的。她們的職業，在軍政商學各界中還祇限於中下階層，美國始終沒有女人當選爲總統，也沒有女人任部長，省長，市長。在軍隊裹女子最高階級是上校，這並不是美人排擠女子，實在女子可以做的事太多，不惜去爭名奪利，美國人講究實惠，不務虛名，最普通的女子職業是敎員，律師，書記，店員，要員，美容師，女招待，畫師，記者，其中尤以書記店員女招待之人數爲多，這種職務責任較輕而待遇甚好，那末爲什麼要參加競選自討苦呢？在美國做官是苦差使，在中國是有土斯有財，那怕做一個芝麻菉豆官像稅務員之類，也可財運亨通，利源大發，利之所在，削尖了肩胛也有人去鑽，難怪中美女性對於做官興趣之不同了。美國女子一聽到政治便會掩耳而走，她們認爲政治總是骯髒的，祇有想在溷水裏摸魚的人，才樂意鑽進政治漩渦，潔身自好的人，犯不着自討苦吃。一個女招待的收入，相同於一個市長收入，如果那個市民不貪汚的話，在貪汚無路的美國，誰願意去搶市長的飯碗？美國人做官都是逼上梁山，結果祗有賠本的份兒，女子總比較勢利的，她們還會爲了做官而願意賠本錢嗎？決不會的，外加，美國沒有官僚資本，或者官商勾結，所以做了官是空有虛名而亳無實利的，重利的美國人把官看得極不屑爲，祇有暴發戶想一嘗做官的滋味，才肯貼錢圖名，光耀鄕里，實在愚不可及之舉。女子職業平均每月收入在美金二百元左右，倘係軍火工人約可倍之，薪金均以每週計，女店員另有分紅，約爲售貨額百分之五，在耶蘇聖誕節前爲分紅最多之期，一星期工作所獲常在三四百元之數，尤以衣飾玩具糖果部職員之收入爲豐。各商店在聖誕節前例須添聘短期工作人員，於是中學女生紛紛前往應徵務，短期收入，足以付全年學膳宿費而有餘，豈高唱提高女權）之中國小姐所可望其項脊哉！　你知道麼？  宗沅譯　　下面的問題，請你判斷一下是「是」還是「否」，然後再和答案比較一下，假如有十四個以上是對的，那麼你的常識就不錯了。　　　沒有人知道一個還沒出生小孩的性別。　　　前額很低是表示這人不聽明。　　　一個對衣着很考究的人，在穿藍衣服時不穿灰鞋子。　　　過度工作，傷心，是神經質的造成者。　　　人類只有五種感覺；看，聽，嗅，嚐味和觸覺。　　　金子對任何酸部不會起作用。　　　一個下陷的下頷，是一種柔和的性格的標記。　　　在海中游泳比普通水中游泳容易。　　　沒有一種物質是金鋼鑽所不能割的。　　　咖啡或茶是極少虹吸管作用的。　　　　野人的視覺能力超過普通人。　　答案：　是　否　否　否　是　否　否　是　否　否　　否最小的書　　這裏介紹你一本世界上最小的書，共字數眞是少到

<p>爲了這，本報社會服務科在八個月以前，發起了一貧婦助產」運動，在萬難的情况下，我們任勞任怨的奮鬥着，我們呼　，吶喊，為了可憐的母親，也為了天　　漫畫的嬰孩。八個月很快的過去了，我們這免費助產運動巳經得到了廣泛的支持和同情，與我們合作的醫院已經由一家增至四家，這四家醫院便是人和醫院，紅十字會醫院，尙　婦孺醫院，和新近加入的保黎醫院，無數的黨心讀者給予我們以經濟上的援助，和道義上的同情。</p>
<p>「貧婦免費助產天」的工作，一天比一天擴大，更廣泛的展開去，從二月到十月，我們援助了一百多個貧窮的產婦，很幸運，在這百多個產婦裏面，沒有一個遭受到死亡的厄運。由於物價的飛漲和幣値的變遷，我們開始感到經費的短絀和募捐集的困難，一方面申請助產的人，却一天天的增加起來，但我們並未因之氣餒，我們相信，不斷的努力，是一定會尅服當前的　難。</p>
<p>前天，一個晴朗的秋天的早上、我們接到了讀者金華豐君的來電，他吿訴我們，他願意獨力負担本報貧婦助產每個月的一切費用，第二天我們和他商定了進行的辦法，和擬定了推行的方針。</p>
<p>金先生是一個慈祥和　的中年商人，秉性謙和而　爽，態度尤其忠實而誠摯，十二年前他是故名醫牛惠　的好友，為了景仰牛氏為人，受了他精神感召，所以他立志為善，誓以經商所得，救濟苦難同胞。金君結婚十八年無　，今年九月初忽舉一雄，當然這給予他很大的安慰。此後我們不會再為「助產金」的經費担心，同時無數貧窮的產婦，也獲得了安全的保障。</p>

<h3>Government Decides to Purchase Unlicensed Imported Goods with Foreign Exchange, Payment to be Cleared in Six Installments Over Three Years</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 14th] In the administrative meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 14th, a decision has been made regarding the handling of Japanese goods arriving in Shanghai with self-provided foreign exchange. The key points are as follows: This batch of goods will be purchased by the government at the original price in foreign exchange, with payment divided into six installments, one installment every half year, to be cleared in three years. In addition, a profit of 10% on the original price (calculated in US dollars) will be added, and converted into legal tender based on the Central Bank's listed market price. Expenses such as dock rent, insurance fees, and harbor dues for the arrived goods shall be borne by the government. The cargo owner is exempt from customs duties.</p>
<p>[Regular Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 14th] The Executive Yuan passed the "Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving and Shipped Without Permits" on the 14th. The original text is as follows: Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods Arriving and Shipped Without Permits. Any self-provided foreign exchange goods without permits, not on the list of prohibited imports, that have already arrived at the port or were shipped from abroad before August 16 of this year, and have been registered in accordance with the order, shall be handled in accordance with these measures. Goods shipped from abroad after August 16 up to September 30 may be allowed to provide documents and re-register. The goods mentioned in the preceding article, with the exception of machinery and equipment in Appendices 1 and 3A for which users pay themselves, shall be purchased by the government, and the payment shall be made with three-year special foreign currency savings certificates issued by the Central Bank. One-sixth of these foreign currency savings certificates shall mature every six months. Upon maturity, importers may hold the certificates to the Central Bank to exchange for foreign exchange to purchase permitted import goods. With the approval of the Import and Export Management Committee, the matured savings certificates may be transferred to registered and qualified importers for exchange into legal tender at the market exchange rate at the Central Bank. The valuation of these goods shall include: A. Landing price, paid with foreign currency savings certificates. B. Unloading costs and dock rent after arrival, paid in legal tender. C. An additional 10% of the purchase cost (calculated based on the landing price at the market exchange rate), paid in legal tender. These goods shall be processed according to the order of their shipping date.</p>
<h3>Government to Sell Purchased Goods Primarily to Direct Users</h3>
<p>Confiscation of All Unlicensed Imported Goods in the Future</p>
<p>The principles for the government's sale of these goods are as follows: A. Raw materials such as cotton and wool will be sold in consultation with relevant industries. B. The China Trust Bureau (中信局) will entrust and supervise ordinary commercial institutions to sell, and the original importers will be given priority consideration. C. If the above methods are not suitable, the China Trust Bureau will sell on its own or through public bidding. D. The goods shall be sold to direct users in principle, and the selling price shall be based on the market price. However, for industrial raw materials, the price sold to factories may be the landing price plus a certain percentage, and the raw materials obtained by the factories shall be regarded as part of the quota that each unit is entitled to. E. Detailed measures for the sale of these goods will be formulated separately. Importers who are unwilling to comply with the above conditions must reship the goods within sixty days. The detailed rules for the implementation of these measures shall be stipulated by the Import and Export Management Committee. In addition to passing the above measures, the Executive Yuan also resolved that all automobiles that have arrived at the port, with the exception of the truck portion to be managed according to these measures, the import of small cars exceeding the quota should not be allowed. It was also decided that in the future, all imported goods without permits will be treated as smuggling and confiscated.</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang Issues Statement: Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Goods are a Balance of Human Sentiment and Law, Not Compulsion</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 14th] Dong Xianguang, the new Director of the Executive Yuan, issued the following statement regarding the measures for handling self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving and shipped:</p>
<p>According to the registered amount, self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving and shipped without permits amount to approximately US$40 million. Not being allowed to import without permission is the main point of trade management. Once this provision is breached, the spirit of trade management is completely lost. In addition, the high selling price of foreign goods in the country is already excessive, giving importers excessive profits, and if the legal tender obtained from the sale of goods flows into the foreign exchange black market, the impact will be even more profound. The government has extensively adopted opinions from all parties on this case, and therefore, balancing human sentiment and law, made the decision passed by the Executive Yuan today regarding the measures for handling self-provided foreign exchange goods arriving and shipped. The key points are: Although these materials are purchased by the government, the purchase price is still paid in foreign currency and given special foreign currency savings certificates. Upon maturity, the principal and interest of these savings certificates can still be exchanged for foreign exchange to purchase permitted import goods. The goods are valued at the landing price, plus an additional ten percent, which is still converted into legal tender at the exchange rate on the date of purchase and payment. As for all dock rent expenses, the government will pay them in national currency. Therefore, merchants not only retain their principal and profit, but also have the value of their currency guaranteed. Among the goods, machinery and equipment belonging to Appendices 1 and 3A for which users pay themselves are not included in the purchase. In addition, the goods will still be sold to relevant industries, and the price of industrial raw materials sold to factories may be the landing price plus a certain percentage, and the raw materials obtained will be regarded as part of the quota that the factories are entitled to, meaning that the factories have the right to purchase these goods with priority and obtain a reasonable purchase price. When the government sells these materials, the original importers will be given priority to act as agents for the sale, so the interests of the importing firms are still taken into consideration. In order to comply with the requests of various trade associations, goods shipped from abroad after August 16 up to September 30 may be allowed to provide documents and re-register. Importers who disregard the above regulations may ship the goods out of the country, so the handling of these goods does not contain any compulsory nature. In short, the intention of these measures is to maintain government regulations on the one hand, limit stimulation of the foreign exchange black market on the other, and take into account the merchants' capital, the factories' needs, and the importers' position.</p>

<h3>The Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party Continues to Discuss Election Matters</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Office] The Democratic Socialist Party convened a temporary Standing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon to continue discussing election matters. After the meeting, Zhang Junmai said that the Democratic Socialist Party's quota of representatives in the general election was originally set at 400 National Assembly representatives and 100 legislative members, which is only slightly less than one-seventh of the total, and much less than the initial ratio of one-fifth, so there can be no further reduction.</p>

<h3>British Parliamentarians Hope China Will Open Inland Rivers; The Authorities Have Expressed Opposition; Responsible Persons of the Shipping Federation Have Also Refuted</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] This agency's reporter visited the responsible persons of the four major institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the International Trade Bureau, the Legislative Yuan, and the Central Bank to inquire about the opinions of Lord Ammon, the head of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, on China's "closed-door policy." The responsible persons of the four institutions unanimously stated that China's policy of protecting inland river and coastal shipping is closely related to the policies strictly enforced by various countries in the world, and is by no means a selfish closed-door policy as claimed by Lord Ammon. They all believed that Lord Ammon excessively emphasized the interests of British shipping in Wuhu and ignored China's need to protect its inland river and coastal shipping. Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, said: "The restrictive measures implemented since the end of the war are not intended to freeze foreign shipping or trade with China, but only to protect China's gradually growing shipping industry."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Regarding Lord Ammon, the head of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, hoping that China will open its inland rivers, the responsible person of the National Shipping Federation said: "This is purely an excuse to attempt to re-enjoy the right to navigate our inland rivers and coasts, which is completely inconsistent with the facts." (Continued on column 6 of page 2)</p>
<h3>British Parliamentary Delegation Arrives in the Former Capital; Lindsay Says the CCP Problem is Serious</h3>

<p>[Associated Press, Beijing, 14th] Lindsay, a Conservative Party member of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, vehemently called on the Chinese government and people to unite to prevent the "terrible crisis" caused by the CCP at a press conference and to place the war against the Communists at a "highest priority above all else." He said: "The entire China should treat the CCP crisis with the attitude of the United Kingdom dealing with the invasion from Germany. The Chinese government and people have not fully recognized the severity of the situation. They do not know that it may spread south." (The itinerary of the delegation after arriving in Shanghai on the 20th can be found in column 7 of page 2)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Measures for Handling Goods Imported Without Permits</h3>
<p>Regarding imported goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange, that is, imported goods without import permits, the measures for handling them have been resolved by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Meeting yesterday: For imported goods that are permitted to be imported, the government will purchase them at the original price with fixed-term foreign exchange; imported goods that are prohibited from being imported will not be allowed to be imported according to regulations. The detailed measures have not yet been seen as of the time this article was written. Whether these handling measures are completely appropriate is another question in itself; however, the government's ability to cut the Gordian knot quickly and not hesitate any longer is indeed what the general public hopes for at present.</p>
<p>The total value of these goods varies from person to person. The lowest estimate is US$30 million, the highest is US$100 million, and most believe it is around US$70 million; even if converted to legal tender at the current official exchange rate, the amount is in the order of four trillion. With such a huge amount of materials, what would be the loss to the general national economy if they were left idle in customs warehouses and not utilized? What would be the direct and indirect losses to the importers? Moreover, according to the more than ten groups of city merchants and others, "60% to 70% of these imported goods are industrial raw materials and necessities, and 10% to 20% are industrial equipment." These raw materials and equipment are undoubtedly urgently needed items in the country, so it is no wonder that the business community has repeatedly called for a solution.</p>
<p>The above two handling principles were decided by the authorities after a long period of consideration before they were submitted to the meeting for resolution. Regardless of what conditions are set or whether they are welcomed by the importers, the principles are unlikely to change again. Therefore, the most worthy of consideration is how to purchase these goods. First, what price will the government use for the purchase? The original purchase price? The local market price? Or based on the purchase price, plus various expenses and so-called legitimate profits? If purchased at the market price, what is the market price at the time? The types of imported goods are different, and the arrival times vary, so does the government have accurate data to base on regarding the various expenses? Now that the government has decided to purchase at the original price, the problem seems to be less, but when the purchase is implemented, it is expected that there will inevitably be problems that need to be properly resolved.</p>
<p>Second, how will the purchase price be settled, that is, paid in cash? Or on account? If everything is on account and not paid in cash for the time being, the loss to the merchants will be too great; however, paying everything in cash seems to be a problem because the amount is too large. Moreover, these goods were purchased with so-called "self-provided foreign exchange," so should they still be paid in foreign exchange? Or converted to legal tender? From the government's point of view, it can give legal tender, and can be converted at the official exchange rate, but the hidden costs to the importer will be large. The current government has decided to pay in foreign exchange in six installments over three years, and also give reasonable profits, which is a well-considered plan. However, should interest still be added to the foreign exchange payments? This still needs to be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Third, how should the goods be disposed of after purchase? The only way is, of course, to sell them. However, several problems will arise when selling: Will the goods be directly distributed to relevant manufacturers, or will they be sold publicly without targeting anyone? If the distribution method is adopted, how will the distribution price be determined? Will they be sold at cost, or at a slight discount to the market price? Or will profits be added appropriately to the cost? What standard will be used for the total profit? Will the goods be sold in bulk immediately after purchase, or will they be sold gradually depending on the needs of the market?</p>
<p>The above many problems are all related to the purchase, and some of them must be resolved urgently. If the solutions are not appropriate, various repercussions will occur, which may affect the government's credibility, so they should all be considered carefully. We believe that purchasing everything is originally a last resort for the government. In the future, all measures must strive to be fair, and should not cause merchants to lose too much, and should not plan to make unexpected high profits from it, so that they can be understood by the general public.</p>
<p>As for imported goods that are prohibited from being imported, it is perfectly proper not to allow them to be imported according to regulations. However, according to the current situation, these goods that are not allowed to be imported are likely to come again by detours, taking the route of smuggling instead of the legal procedures of customs declaration and taxation. If the government retreats without taking other effective measures, it will be tantamount to promoting smuggling and only causing the customs to lose a large amount of tax revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate the detailed implementation of these two handling measures carefully.</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang's Speech</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Madame Chiang said in her speech: I am very happy to be able to gather here with you tonight and to represent the Chinese women's community in welcoming you. We are very honored that the World YWCA has chosen China as the venue for its conference.</p>
<p>Broad Achievements</p>
<p>When I received your invitation, I originally thought that I should let someone who participates in the daily work of the YWCA and has a closer relationship with the YWCA deliver the welcome speech. However, the achievements of the YWCA in our country are far greater than the number of members. It represents a spirit and social force that deeply moves Chinese women. The YWCA has made brilliant contributions to improving the world. I am one of those who are deeply concerned about the problem of improving the world, so I dared to accept this opportunity to represent Chinese women and express our sincere respect to the representatives present who are dedicated to promoting this great world movement. You have come to China at a time when it is undergoing eight years of cruel and arduous war. Due to material difficulties, our hospitality to you may be simple, but this will certainly not reduce our sincere welcome. We are especially grateful that you have chosen to hold the conference here, knowing that China lacks convenient amenities.</p>
<p>The YWCA has a close relationship with our people. Many years ago, when I was not yet married, I had just returned from studying in the United States, and I was very honored to have a close relationship with the Shanghai YWCA. At that time, I was a volunteer supervisor of the Industrial Committee of the YWCA. Looking back now, the experiences at that time had a great enlightening effect on my life. I was originally very interested in social problems, but from that time on, I began to pay special attention to the problems of child laborers and female laborers in factories. The establishment of the Child Labor Committee by the Shanghai Municipal Council was partly the result of the efforts of the Industrial Committee, and the current Chinese Factory Law is also greatly influenced by the association. This is an example of the role played by the YWCA in society.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Hangzhou is the most suitable city in China to be chosen as the venue for your conference. Hangzhou is one of the most meaningful cities in China, not only does it have world-renowned beautiful scenery, but it is also rich in historical significance and ancient sites.</p>
<p>Great Women</p>
<p>There are two great women in Chinese history whose names are closely related to Hangzhou, which is of particular significance to our conference.</p>
<p>If you were to ask who the most famous women in Chinese history are, I think even a three-foot child would answer you: Yue Mu and Qiu Jin. These two immortal women have an inextricable relationship with the history of Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Yue Fei was a patriotic soldier of the Song Dynasty who resisted the invasion of the Jin people. His loyal remains are buried in Hangzhou. Anyone who comes to Hangzhou to visit will sincerely pay tribute to Yue Fei's tomb. He sacrificed his life for the country loyally and bravely, and his lifelong spirit of ardent patriotism was derived from his mother's education. Yue Fei's mother tattooed the words "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" on his back when he was young, and she created a national hero for China who will be remembered for generations.</p>
<p>In modern times, Hangzhou is also the burial place of the revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin. Qiu Jin was the most progressive woman in modern China. She struggled constantly to realize the ideals of liberating the nation and equality between men and women, and finally made a noble sacrifice. Everyone respects her as one of the great revolutionary martyrs.</p>
<p>These two noble figures in Chinese history are buried in Hangzhou. I hope you will be able to take time to visit their mausoleums.</p>
<p>However, Hangzhou has a more direct reason for being of special significance to this conference.</p>
<p>Because the Chinese YWCA was first founded 57 years ago in a church girls' school in Hangzhou. The active founders of the YWCA at that time were the mother of Mr. Stuart Leighton, the current US Ambassador to China, and the mother of Mr. Bi Fanyu. Mrs. Stuart Leighton is also buried in Hangzhou. I hope everyone can take advantage of this conference to visit her grave and express our respect for this great Christian. Since the YWCA movement in China was first created in Hangzhou, it has spread like wildfire and has now spread all over the country.</p>
<p>Creating History</p>
<p>I often like to think back to the great people of the past, but the task of creating history today has fallen on our shoulders.</p>
<p>Representatives from twenty-three different countries have come from thousands of miles away. You represent a powerful world force that can work to promote a more perfect order between nations. You represent the women of the world speaking out what they want to say in their hearts. In this era full of unease and hesitation, your association has established an opportunity for women of goodwill in countries around the world to concentrate their forces. In many parts of the world, there are scattered and isolated people of benevolence and high ideals who are praying for international peace and understanding. Your association provides them with a unified central organization. We must know that the world is eagerly awaiting the heroic leadership that strives for peace! The World YWCA is fair and selfless, does not talk about interests, does not distinguish national boundaries, is rich in noble ideals, and at the same time knows the value and power of the spirit to society, and can give the women of the world this kind of leadership.</p>
<p>Now many people have a beautiful vision of the future of the world in their hearts, but due to their own internal weaknesses, they cannot take action to make their ideals a reality.</p>
<p>Removing Obstacles</p>
<p>I am even more convinced that the obstacles preventing mankind from enjoying a beautiful world order are mostly in people's own hearts. If we want to gain the will and courage to act, we must first remove the obstacles within us.</p>
<p>I think the first psychological obstacle that must be removed is suspicion. Nations and nations, ethnic groups and ethnic groups, are separated by vicious suspicion. Cooperation cannot survive in an atmosphere of doubt and disbelief.</p>
<p>The second psychological obstacle is that we do not believe in the inherent goodness of human nature. I know that in our time, everyone attributes depravity and corruption to human nature. This group of people also has a set of specious evidence to defend their claims. If we start from the premise that human nature is evil, how can we hope for a better world in the future? All of us who have not lost the ideal of governing the world with morality must abandon this kind of defeatist view of human nature being evil.</p>
<p>Third, there are quite a few people now who adopt an indifferent attitude towards the grain species they should strive for, so that all their strength is not mobilized. They have far-reaching ideals, but lack the will to improve the world. They would rather passively drift with the tide and be manipulated, and as a result, they are abandoned by history. If we have learned some lessons from World War II, the lesson is that after blood and pain, nations that lack enthusiasm are tantamount to inviting totalitarianism to invade themselves. Only if we are willing to work hard to realize a better world can we have the possibility of achieving our ideals.</p>
<p>New Enlightenment</p>
<p>I deeply understand that in all efforts to benefit the masses, disappointments and setbacks are inevitable. Our ideals are often higher than our actual achievements. We hope to achieve great achievements immediately, but when our hopes cannot be achieved, we cannot help but feel frustrated with the work at hand. However, it is a great misconception to think that fantasy can easily succeed. The greatest achievements in life often seem certain to fail at first. I recently gained a new understanding of this experience.</p>
<p>When I was in Shanghai recently, I traveled to Yushan in Qingpu, which is a beautiful place. From the foot of the mountain, there is a long stone staircase mountain road, and from the middle of the mountain to the top, there are fourteen turns. We can call them four small stations. Each station has an iron shrine, engraved with the entire process of Jesus Christ's suffering on the way to the suburbs of Jerusalem. On each suffering stele, there are texts related to the teachings, instructing us on the lessons we should learn in each stage of Jesus' suffering. Finally, we reach the top of Yushan, where a solemn and magnificent Catholic Church stands, which is the culmination of the meaning of the cross and a symbol of human suffering and fraternity.</p>
<p>This is truly an enlightening scene. However, for those who are not familiar with the story of Christ, the fourteen suffering steles only show the entire failure ending with the cross. From this person's point of view, it seems that Christ's mission resulted in an unavoidable disaster. However, we know that Christ's glory is one of the greatest achievements in history. We also know that the reason why this world can transcend from barbarism or something worse than barbarism and be saved is because of Christ's spirit of sacrifice and the tragic story of being nailed to the cross. Christ's great teaching: "Love your neighbor as yourself"! It is a beacon guiding us and giving us hope in today's world.</p>
<p>We must not be blinded by temporary success, nor must we be frustrated by current failures. If we believe that we are right, we must move forward bravely, and we must not feel discouraged because of the cost or sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sacred Battle</p>
<p>In this great post-war era, the YWCA and other similar organizations are fighting for moral values in a contradictory and war-torn world. Now they are facing a difficult battle, but it is a sacred battle that we must support with inner faith and aspiration, and we must overcome temporary failures and disillusionment. We must have unwavering confidence in the future of the world.</p>
<p>China has been in a world that seems to have forgotten its struggle, but it has always held a belief that it only relies on the iron-like "justice" to support it, and in such hopelessness, it has continued to fight year after year. We Chinese deeply understand the meaning of this kind of struggle, and we realize how this kind of struggle gives us the inner strength that rewards us.</p>
<p>In this post-war world, the goal that we Chinese yearn for is the international order that the World YWCA is striving for. In the process of this battle, we can all cooperate sincerely and work together. I believe that the World YWCA conference that will open tomorrow will be an important battle in this battle. We are really honored that your conference is being held in Hangzhou, China. (The End)</p>
<h3>Oppose Opening Inland Waterways</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Since Queen Elizabeth of England in the 16th century, she has been developing maritime shipping as the foundation of the country. Engaging in inland and coastal navigation within the territorial waters of other countries has been its consistent national policy. Therefore, the series of unequal treaties from the Sino-British Treaty of Nanjing in the 22nd year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty to the Sino-British Mackay Treaty in the 28th year of Guangxu, all aimed at obtaining navigation privileges. The British merchant houses Jardine Matheson and Swire have also worked hard to cooperate with their national policy, taking over the affairs and engaging in inland and coastal navigation in China for more than 70 years, so that China's infant shipping industry has been suppressed and has never been able to rise. We sincerely hope that the British visiting delegation to China will correct the misunderstandings formed by some people in the past who attached importance to navigation privileges and navigation interests, and promote the British government to conclude a Sino-British Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation in accordance with the spirit of the treaty on the abolition of British extraterritoriality in China and the handling of relevant issues concluded by Britain on January 11, 1947, in order to promote the friendship and business development between the two countries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] When the British opportunity visiting delegation to China hosted a reception for reporters in Peiping today, they emphasized that restoring Sino-British trade would require China to open inland waterways. Councilor Yatai said that Britain is a country that opens inland waterways. Foreign ships can reach under the London Bridge directly. China has some open natural resources that Britain needs, and it is willing to exchange them for machinery and other things. If inland waterways are not opened, this kind of trade cannot proceed. As in January of this year, your country ordered a batch of goods in Britain, and the payment has been made. Britain sincerely hopes to transport these goods to China, but cannot find a way to do so. Another member of the delegation, Morrison, continued that China must open inland waterways for Sino-British trade to be restored and developed. There are three reasons: China does not have many ships. If China does not open inland waterways, transportation will be extremely difficult. British ships have sailed on the inland rivers of central and southern China in the past and have rich experience. If foreign ships can only reach seaports, the goods will be unloaded and reloaded, and the high handling fees will have a great impact. Morrison pointed to the sweater he was wearing and said: "This is produced in northwestern China. There were many shipments before the war, and the quality is excellent. The current market price in the UK is about 10 to 15 pounds per load. I don't know if this Chinese wool can resume exports?"</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Old Capital</h3>
<p>Examining Jin Bihui's Audience Pass; Strange Women Widely Advertise for Marriage; (Qian)</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th Dispatch] Snippets from the old capital: Jin Bihui (Kawashima Yoshiko) will be publicly tried tomorrow. When the court pre-issued audience passes today, there was a scramble due to the large number of people, and a violent scene broke out. Windows were smashed, and some were sold for thousands of yuan each. In the past year, there has been a so-called "strange woman" in the city who has been performing comedies repeatedly. Because she has not met the ideal husband she has been searching for, she has repeatedly asked various newspapers to publish her marriage advertisements for free, and posted notices outside the air-raid shelters on the city walls where she lives and in the city area stating: "Fairy He Xiangu is seeking a husband, 24 years old. Those who are willing to provide dowry must meet the following conditions: a set of gold bracelets, a leather coat, a pair of champagne shoes, and one million in cash. Those who are sincere are invited to visit the third cave dwelling of Hepingmen." Peking opera is increasingly declining in the old capital. Even Xun Huisheng's performance of his signature "Hongniang" sold only 200 tickets yesterday and lost millions. Foreign film merchants opposed supporting the troops, leading to the popularity of Soviet films.</p>

She will return to Shanghai after a day or two of sightseeing. She was accompanied by an American female secretary.</p>
<h3>Continued Rise in Hunan Rice Prices; Changsha City Government Convenes Expanded Pricing Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changsha, 14th] Hunan rice has reached over 350,000 [currency units], a 160% increase compared to a month ago. Despite a total ban on transportation, the price surge has not abated. The Changsha Municipal Government has convened an expanded pricing conference to stabilize grain prices, deciding to: fully secure the city's grain supply and request the provincial government to send capable personnel to the lakeside areas to strictly enforce the ban on hoarding; request the provincial government to restrict grain transport and purchasing; prohibit foreign merchants from purchasing food in the city; temporarily prohibit grain from being transported down the river or loaded onto vehicles in non-rice-producing areas of the city; establish a grain consumption cooperative, requesting the municipal government to supply grain at low prices; restore the "Ever-Normal Granary" system, requesting the provincial government to allocate tribute grain for immediate implementation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou City Market Catches Rice Weevils</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 14th] Suzhou's price surge is rampant. Rice has reached seven "guan" per "shi" (unit of dry measure), and flour is approaching three "guan." The county government has taken three emergency measures: ordering the arrest of elements disrupting the market with speculative capital. Today, the Public Security Bureau apprehended six rice weevils with various "purchasing permits" in the market, clearly engaged in speculative malpractices, and has resolved to severely punish them.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Fuzhou, 14th] Prices in Fuzhou have recently exhibited malignant inflation, with rice breaking through the 600,000 mark, pork at 24,000, eggs at 3,000, and almost all other goods experiencing price increases. Coupled with the black market volatility of gold and paper money, the market is increasingly chaotic. Credit is tight, and financial transactions are sluggish. Many businesses have stopped lending. Yesterday, a certain bank sent personnel to Shanghai to transport currency for emergency relief. Living conditions are difficult, and morale is low. The authorities have yet to devise countermeasures, and the price surge continues to set new records.</p>

<h3>Polish Journey, Letter VII: Glimpses of Society Behind the Iron Curtain - The Lonely Poles (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Poland has always played a tragic role on the European international stage. The European part of World War II began with Poland's misfortune. I still remember that timid and incompetent old man at 10 Downing Street, London, Neville Chamberlain. He once tremblingly declared that the British Empire was fighting to fulfill the Anglo-Polish Treaty, to guarantee Poland's territorial integrity and sovereign independence. However, after the war, Poland lost nine million lives and 77,000 square kilometers of territory. Perhaps, even today, many British people feel a hidden sense of shame when they talk about Poland. Before President Roosevelt's death, at a certain impromptu press conference, a reporter asked, "What does the President think about Russia's demand to cede Polish territory?" President Roosevelt, as intelligent as he was, was momentarily stunned. He pondered for a long time and replied in a deep voice, "I deeply admire Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of China for declaring that he has no territorial ambitions towards Thailand."</p>
<p>Some say that President Roosevelt was "angered" to death by the so-called "Curzon Line" dispute in Poland. Perhaps such speculation is excessive, but in the minds of the 23 million Poles today (except for a small portion of the Polish Communist Party), the Curzon Line caused them to lose 181,500 square kilometers of eastern territory, which is an indelible scar for them. On this fertile land, there were originally three million Poles who had lived there for generations. According to the person in charge of the Polish Ministry of the Interior, 1.5 million people have already been sent back to western Poland, and another 1.5 million are on their way to be repatriated.</p>
<p>"Lose at the east end, gain at the west end!" At the Tehran Conference, the "Big Three" agreed that Poland would take back 104,500 square kilometers of land from Germany, which is the so-called Oder River basin, half of East Brandenburg, and the Danzig Corridor. The Communist Party in Poland heavily promoted this, saying it was the generosity of the "Soviet ally" and that the Soviet Union helped Poland "recover lost territory." On slogans and posters in the streets of Warsaw, and even in magazines and publications, you can see a map of Poland's western new border at any time, but you rarely see a map of the eastern "new border."</p>
<p>The Poles call this land obtained from Germany the "Recovered Territories." In the cabinet, a "Recovered Territories Administration Department" was specially set up. The Minister is Gomułka, the number one "red person" in Poland today, the Central Secretary of the Polish Communist Party, and Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet. He is also the administrative governor of the Polish Recovered Territories.</p>
<p>I met with Polish friends in the Recovered Territories Administration Department. He said that the importance of the Recovered Territories is not only that it has recovered "lost territory" for the Poles, but also that it has laid a stepping stone for world peace, because Silesia, in the upper reaches of the Oder River, was originally the center of the German arms industry, and Prussia was the cradle of German "militarism." Now that it has been taken over by Poland as compensation, it is tantamount to completely disarming the war-loving Germans.</p>
<p>He said that before the war, there were seven million Germans and 800,000 Poles living in the Recovered Territories. By the time of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender in 1945, there were only two million Germans left. Now, Polish refugees and Poles repatriated from east of the Curzon Line have moved into the "Recovered Territories" one after another. The Polish government is responsible for transporting 1,200 to 2,000 Germans westward every month, ordering them to make a living on their own.</p>
<p>The "man-made" population migration caused by this war has created a rare miracle in European history. When I was in New York, I read Professor Hayes's "Collection of Essays on Nationalism," former U.S. Ambassador to Spain. I remember one chapter in which he discussed many ways to solve national problems. He mentioned many historical tragedies of "forced migration" and the unimaginable consequences arising from the tragedies. He said that some wars in history came about in this way, with endless "recovery of lost territory" creating a lot of killing between nations.</p>
<p>I am not a prophet, and I will not interfere in predicting what bad consequences will arise from Poland's newly acquired "Recovered Territories" in 20 or 30 years. At least, the current Polish authorities will not, and do not want to think about this. During my stay in Warsaw, I came into contact with many Poles. I think the Polish people are very lovely. Except for being a bit addicted to alcohol, most Poles retain the simplicity, innocence, and frankness of a rural society.</p>
<p>However, the environment has created many complex international relations for Poland, making many Western Europeans, Americans, and even Chinese dissatisfied with, and even cursing Poland's major policies and national policies. Last year, when I was in the United States, I listened to the meetings of the United Nations Security Council. No matter how fluent the Polish representative Wosga Lang's English was, or how tactful his speech was, the audience always had a kind of "disgust" for Poland's performance. The Chinese in particular will never forget Foreign Minister Beck of the old League of Nations in Geneva, that typical international politician who "helped the villain to do evil."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Beck was active in the late years of Piłsudski in Poland. Polish friends said that Piłsudski had been in exile in Japan in his early years. At that time, Poland was in the era of being divided by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The Japanese authorities treated Piłsudski very courteously, and at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919, they supported Piłsudski's "national restoration movement." Piłsudski's "pro-Japanese" at that time did not originally want to deliberately "be hostile to China." Later, when Germany rose, Piłsudski, in order to traditionally "oppose Russia," eventually helped the villain to do evil in his later years and could not extricate himself. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Major Powers Unanimously Support Partition Plan; Bloodshed in Holy Land Seems Unavoidable; Soviet Representative Suggests Modifying Arab-Jewish Borders</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] State Department officials anticipate that bloodshed in the Holy Land is inevitable after British troops withdraw from Palestine. Since the Soviet Union expressed support for partition, partition has become inevitable, and the Arab world's armed resistance and the Arab countries' willingness to withdraw from the United Nations are almost expected. People close to the British representatives believe that the Soviet Union's attitude has disappointed the Arab countries. The opinions of the major powers on this issue are almost unanimous, and the relationship between Jews and Arabs is close to breaking down. It is expected that some Arab extremists may act freely.</p>
<p>The UN Palestine Committee is scheduled to discuss the following issues at Lake Success today at 2:00 PM standard time: Jewish-Arab borders; the date when Britain will hand over the mandate and withdraw its troops; and the authorities during the transition period. The committee will also recommend that no foreign troops be sent to Palestine and that only Jewish and Arab militias be responsible for maintaining order.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 13th] In an important policy statement issued today, the Soviet Union endorsed the principle of partition for Palestine. The Soviet Union announced this position at the Palestine Special Committee. This is the first time at this session of the General Assembly that the United States and the Soviet Union have basically agreed on an important issue. However, although the Soviet Union agrees with the view of partition, it opposes the borders drawn by the United Nations Investigative Committee in Geneva. The Soviet Union hinted that it would announce special amendments later. The Soviet Union and the United States have not correctly explained how the partition of the Holy Land will be implemented. Before this, the Soviet Union had advocated that if the plan was feasible, a Jewish-Arab federation could be established. But on the 13th, Soviet representative Terapkin said that under the current extremely tense Arab-Jewish relations, this federation is clearly difficult to implement. The Soviet Union also demanded that Britain's mandate over Palestine should be ended as soon as possible. The Soviet delegation requested that the General Assembly, when implementing partition, agree to produce an administrative body to govern Palestine. This body should be responsible to the United Nations. The Soviet Union called for the resolution of the Palestine issue to begin on a broad political basis.</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Johnson told the press, "We are very interested in the Soviet statement. We are very pleased that their views coincide with ours on this fundamental issue." The Jewish Congress representing Palestine also welcomed the policy announcement, believing that it was "an inevitable and consistent development of Soviet policy."</p>
<h3>Arab Group Firmly Opposes the Establishment of a Jewish State in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[United Press, Damascus, Beirut, 13th] Leaders of the Arab League are scheduled to meet on the 14th to discuss the United States' proposal to partition Palestine. It is understood that the representatives feel deeply that although the United States hopes to make "some geographical modifications" to the majority report of the United Nations Investigative Committee, the Arabs will not be indifferent to this. Saudi Arabian representative Ye Xin told reporters, "This is a matter of principle, not detail. The Arabs are making every effort to oppose the establishment of a Jewish state, and there is absolutely no room for bargaining." Iraqi Prime Minister Yeb told reporters, "Please frankly inform the Americans that the partition of Palestine will cause trouble and difficulty. We did not expect the United States to take such a move, which is extremely bad." The Arab representatives refused to speculate on the possibility of the Arabs taking arbitrary action if Britain were to withdraw and hand over administrative power to an international peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 14th] It is understood that Britain has sternly warned Arab countries that implementing the Arab League's resolution and assembling troops on the border of Palestine will cause serious consequences. Britain threatened that the 100,000 British troops in the Holy Land will take severe measures against any Arab rebellion in the Holy Land, because Britain is still responsible for maintaining order there. It is believed here that Britain's disapproval is the most effective weapon to eliminate the Arab plan to march into the Holy Land, because the regular armies of most Arab countries rely on Britain for a large amount of weapons and the assistance of officers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 13th] Jewish National Committee Chairman Li Misz claimed that reinforcements had been sent to the Jewish area in northern Palestine to prevent attacks. He also announced that every Jew in Palestine should donate one day's pay each month to fund the protection of the Jewish area.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Amman, Capital of Transjordan, 13th] Transjordanian Prime Minister Rifai tonight denied the claim that Arab countries were stationing troops on the border of Palestine, saying that this move would damage Arab principles. No matter what resolution the Arab League adopts, it will not be implemented before British troops withdraw from Palestine. King Abdullah of Transjordan welcomed the twenty-one representatives of the Arab League today, but Grand Mufti Husseini was not among them.</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative Urges the Prompt Establishment of a "Little Assembly"</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 14th Broadcast, Lake Success Dispatch, U.S. Representative Dulles delivered a speech in the UN Political Committee today, advocating the prompt establishment of a "Standing Committee" of 55 countries to give the United Nations a new vitality. Dulles denied the Soviet claim that this move aimed to overthrow the Security Council, and said that the committee would still be bound by the Security Council when carrying out its work. After delivering his speech, Dulles gave a branch of olive to the Soviet representative and said, "I hope that all countries can propose constructive revisions to the U.S. proposal." According to reports, Dulles was referred to as a "warmonger" by the Soviet side.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Attacks U.S. Congressional Delegation Visiting Europe; Decides to Offer a Cold Shoulder</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] Moscow Radio commented: More than 200 U.S. Congressmen have launched a veritable invasion of Europe. This is not a casual trip. These congressional delegations are even equipped in a military fashion, including representatives from various military departments. Some U.S. Congressmen are willing to enter the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union, with its national sovereignty as the priority, is unwilling to become the object of suspicious investigation and has rejected them.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Damascus, 13th] The U.S. Congressional delegation, led by Republican Congressman Merrow, arrived here today to conduct an investigation. Tonight, they will visit Syrian President Kurli.</p>
<p>[Reuters Report, Baghdad, 13th] Due to the Iraqi government and people's protest against the U.S.'s support for the partition of the Holy Land, when the U.S. Congressional delegation arrives in Baghdad tomorrow, it will no longer be an official visit, but only an unofficial visit.</p>
<h3>Debate on the Greek Issue Concludes; Soviet Counterproposal Rejected; Vyshinsky Defends the Communist International</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 13th] The UN Political Committee today completed the discussion on the dispute between Greece and its three northern neighbors and rejected the Soviet proposal. Previously, the Political Committee passed the U.S. proposal on Saturday, setting up a special committee by the General Assembly to monitor the disputed area and to find ways to improve the dispute between the four Balkan countries. The U.S. proposal will now be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion in order to take appropriate action.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 13th] British representative McNeil solemnly denied in the UN Political Committee that Britain had any intention of threatening the independence of Yugoslavia. He replied to the accusation of Ukrainian representative Manuisky, referring to it as an irresponsible accusation. In today's meeting, the Slavic countries' representatives spoke the most. Soviet representative Vyshinsky defended his proposed resolution, which attributed the entire responsibility for the Balkan unrest to the Greek government and demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Greece and that a United Nations committee be established to supervise U.S. aid to Greece. Britain, the United States, France, and other countries firmly opposed this resolution. During the debate, McNeil's statement that "Manuisky's accusation against the British Labour Party leader shows that the Communist International has been restored" provoked Vyshinsky's rebuttal. Vyshinsky said, "Due to the meeting of the nine countries' communist parties in Warsaw, you have become delusional, but in fact there is no Communist International. The members of the Communist International are by no means limited to nine countries. Only nine countries have made you panic. Why not take some medicine to calm your fears?" The entire section of the Soviet resolution was rejected by a vote of 40 to 6, with 11 abstentions. The first part of the resolution, namely the part that attributed the responsibility for the Balkan unrest to Greece, was rejected by a vote of 39 to 7, with 10 abstentions. The second part, which demanded the withdrawal of foreign troops, was rejected by a vote of 33 to 8, with 16 abstentions. The third part, which established a committee to supervise U.S. aid to Greece, was rejected by a vote of 35 to 6, with 16 abstentions.</p>
<h3>Tsaldaris Accused of Being an Axis Spy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 14th] Former Hungarian intelligence chief Major General Istevie, a war criminal currently imprisoned in the Soviet Union, wrote to a newspaper on the 14th, claiming that Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris was a spy for the Axis powers during the war. In 1942 and 1943, Tsai provided Germany and Italy with detailed information on Greek guerrilla positions and British army and naval intelligence in the Middle East through Hungarian people. In the first few months, Tsai received a subsidy of 1,500 pounds.</p>
<h3>Anti-Communist Parties Win in the Roman Municipal Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 14th Broadcast: Rome Report, the municipal elections in Rome are nearing their end, and the competition among the parties is fierce. The anti-communist parties have currently won 67.9% of the total votes. The left-wing front overwhelmed Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party, winning 4,319 more votes, but this does not mean that the left-wing front has won. The left-wing front and the Democratic Party each won 27 seats in the Municipal Council, and the remaining 26 seats were won by other anti-communist parties.</p>
<h3>Top U.S. Government Officials Gather at the White House; Truman Listens to Reports; Thorough Review of the Current Situation in Europe</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 13th] A group of senior officials presented a report to President Truman today on their direct observations of the situation in Western Europe. This report is related to the United States' plan for the economic recovery of Europe. In the White House meeting, the President listened to oral reports on economic and political aspects. Providing the reports were Ambassador to Britain Douglas, Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, Military Governor of the U.S. occupied zone in Germany General Clay, Clay's advisor Murphy, and Deputy Secretary of State Clayton. Acting Secretary of State Lovett and officials from the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation were also present to listen to the opinions of officials who had recently returned from Europe.</p>
<p>Later, Secretary of State Marshall and other cabinet members had lunch with the President at the White House. The new White House Secretary said: The report prepared by the U.S. Aid Economic Resources Problem's Krug Committee was submitted to the President last week and is currently being studied by the President. This report will be distributed to cabinet members and congressional members this week.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman convened senior political and diplomatic officials at the White House today for the most thorough review of the European situation. Related parties said that the following issues were discussed: The steps taken so far have not enabled France and Italy to obtain adequate funds to pay for the necessary dollar area imports, so the possibility of using the funds held by the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation for emergency purposes should be reviewed; A thorough review of the policies implemented by the Soviet Union in Europe. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Treasury Secretary Snyder, who had just returned from Europe, and Deputy Secretary of State Clayton were often able to provide Truman with extremely valuable information to formulate countermeasures against the nine-nation Communist Information Bureau; Review the emergency food plan. U.S. officials acknowledge that the food plan is in poor shape. If no other measures are taken, the export of food will inevitably be reduced.</p>

<p>今年孫借用美方技術，曾拍攝「美國大觀」影片一部，內容係敘述兩中國旅美記者目中所見之美國種種，包括美國山水。人物。社會等各種內慕動態，為一純拌紀錄片，目的係在介紹進步中的美國悄况，除女主角為黎莉裁外，男角原定由金燄担任，嗣因金出國護照未能辦妥，復以經費關係，該片在完成三分之一後不得己停拍，孫黎返國後，該片仍暫存美國，聞將俟明春運回，在滬用國內背景補足鏡頭。據孫談稱：「美國電影製片技術，近年來有驚人進步，此次週遊各地，實地觀察，心得頗多，將來我國電影工業，欲求訊速進展，除需訓練大批有深刻修養之優秀人才外，技術方面擬先與美國合作，多拍幾部巾美合作影片，傳能收觀摩誘導之效。」聞孫在好萊塢時，會與名攝影師黃宗沾商談此項計劃，黃旅美已達三十餘年，其攝片技術在好萊塢飲譽極隆，彼對祖國電影改進素具熟誠，最近即將來滬與孫等籌劃。據孫瑜表示，今年年內，彼決盡力協助充實及改進現有之各項設備，明春當可希望有較為理想之影片陸續出現。　　黎莉莉在美因研續甚勤，聞其歌喉及舞藝已有極高成就，黎本為十餘年前梅花歌舞團時代之有數健將，其主演之「到自然去」及「塞上風雲」均為名嗓一時之潔作，此次千錘百鍊，學成歸來，對我國未來影業，當一更有不少貢獻。昨黎在碼頭上會笑謂：「希望我們今後能拍幾部優秀的書樂片，替甲國影壇劃出一條新生的通路」。</p>
<p>This year, Sun, borrowing American technology, once filmed a movie titled "Panorama of America," the content of which describes the various aspects of America as seen by two Chinese reporters traveling in the United States, including American landscapes, people, society, and other inside dynamics, as a purely documentary film, aimed at introducing the state of progress in America. Except for the female lead, Li Lili, the male role was originally intended to be played by Jin Yan. However, due to Jin's passport not being processed and financial constraints, the film had to be stopped after completing one-third of it. After Sun and Li returned to China, the film remained temporarily in the United States and is said to be shipped back next spring to supplement the scenes with a domestic background in Shanghai. According to Sun, "American film production technology has made astonishing progress in recent years. This tour of various places and on-site observation has yielded many insights. In the future, if China's film industry seeks rapid progress, in addition to training a large number of outstanding talents with profound cultivation, it is planned to cooperate with the United States in technology, filming several Sino-American cooperative films, which can be expected to achieve observational and guiding effects." It is heard that Sun discussed this plan with the famous cinematographer Huang Zongzhan in Hollywood. Huang has been traveling in the United States for more than 30 years, and his filming technology is highly regarded in Hollywood. He has always had a sincere desire to improve the country's films and will soon come to Shanghai to plan with Sun and others. According to Sun Yu, within this year, he is determined to do his best to help enrich and improve the existing equipment, and it can be hoped that more ideal films will appear one after another next spring. Li Lili has been studying very diligently in the United States, and it is said that her singing and dancing skills have achieved extremely high accomplishments. Li was originally one of the most capable veterans of the Plum Blossom Song and Dance Troupe more than ten years ago. Her starring roles in "Go to Nature" and "Frontier Storm" were both famous and well-known works at the time. This time, after repeated refinement and returning with acquired skills, she will undoubtedly make many more contributions to China's future film industry. Yesterday, Li smiled at the pier and said: "I hope we can film a few excellent music films in the future and create a new path for the Chinese film industry."</p>

<p>Fourteen-Year-Old Homicide Case: The High Court Continues to Hear the Case, Gu Zhuxuan Still Claims He Was Falsely Accused of Instigating Due to Failed Extortion</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕十四年前轟動滬上之大世界遊藝塲經理唐嘉鵬，被人喑殺身死，天蟾舞合老顯顧竹軒涉嫌被控敎唆殺人案，前經江蘇高三分院實告無罪，但檢察官不服上訴，經最高法院剣還更審，適值戰事發生，該案即不了而了，勝利後本市高院重理舊案，於九月八日，會傳顧審訊一次，昨日上午十時許，該案再度續審。　　顧着黑馬掛，灰色呢夾袍，精神似較上次開庭時為差。對於敎唆暗殺唐嘉鵬事矢口否認，供稱兇手趙廣福誣蔡渠為敎唆犯，實因敲詐不遂之故，當時趙之親筆信係由同監犯薛振翼轉交，庭上請以何故趙在舊法租界警務處中即供稱是汝唆，彼尚無借錢不遂之事發生。又詢辭振翼此人現在何處，可傳來作證，此係對當有利者，如薛測到庭證明趙廣福確有索詐函交渠轉交，則此案可結，顧稱薛已有十餘年不見，現不知么向。總稱兇手趙廣福業已死亡。同案犯張廷桂據問亦死，至於另一嫌疑敎唆犯王興高，顧稍根本不認識，後在法庭上見過幾次面，當護律師則稱:趙廣福之親筆索詐西已由前高三分院縝密檢定，會命趙當庭核對筆跡，證明無訛，紀録在卷，根據此點，即可結案。至於傳訊證人，因十餘年來事過境遷，或已死亡，或不知去向，至為困難。庭諭本案尙需調查，改期再審，顯仍交原保候傳。</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World Amusement Park, which caused a sensation in Shanghai 14 years ago, was assassinated. Gu Zhuxuan, a prominent figure in the Tianchan Dance Hall, was suspected of instigating the murder and was acquitted by the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. However, the prosecutor appealed, and the Supreme Court ordered a retrial. Due to the outbreak of war, the case was dropped. After the victory, the Shanghai High Court reopened the case and summoned Gu for questioning on September 8. Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, the case was retried. Gu wore a black mandarin jacket and a gray wool-lined robe, and his spirits seemed lower than at the previous hearing. He flatly denied instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, claiming that the murderer Zhao Guangfu falsely accused him of being an instigator because of a failed extortion attempt. At that time, Zhao's handwritten letter was delivered by a fellow prisoner, Xue Zhenyi. The court asked why Zhao had confessed in the Old French Concession Police Department that he was instigated by Gu, when there had been no unsuccessful attempt to borrow money yet. He also inquired about the whereabouts of Xue Zhenyi, stating that summoning him to testify would be beneficial to the defense, as Xue's testimony could prove that Zhao Guangfu did indeed have an extortion letter delivered through him, which would allow the case to be closed. Gu stated that he had not seen Xue for more than ten years and did not know his whereabouts. He claimed that the murderer Zhao Guangfu had already died. Zhang Tinggui, a co-defendant in the case, was also reportedly dead. As for Wang Xinggao, another suspected instigator, Gu claimed that he did not know him at all and had only seen him a few times in court. The defense lawyer stated that Zhao Guangfu's handwritten extortion letter had been carefully examined and verified by the former Third Branch of the High Court, and Zhao was ordered to verify the handwriting in court, proving it to be correct, which was recorded in the files. Based on this point, the case could be closed. As for summoning witnesses, it was extremely difficult because more than ten years had passed, and some may have died or their whereabouts were unknown. The court ordered that the case still needed investigation and rescheduled the retrial, and he was still released on bail pending further investigation.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the morning of July 24th last year, a strange kidnapping case occurred in this city. The protagonist, Xue Jianqiu, who had served as a translator for the enemy's stationed forces in Zhuji and Mei and as a special commissioner of the puppet Zhuji Political Security Bureau, was kidnapped at 9:30 AM on the escalator of the Property Allocation Committee of the Executive Yuan on Central Sichuan Road by Zhang Yucan (also known as Xifu), who claimed to have been the commander of the East Zhejiang Guerrilla, and two accomplices. They took Xue by pedicab to the Mei Hua Restaurant on West Fuxing Road for breakfast, then to Wu Wei Qi for lunch, and then to the Hua An Barber Shop for a haircut. In the evening, they went to the Goldfish Cafe for dinner and then to the Koshman Ballroom for dancing. After tiring of dancing, they went to the Waterfront Hotel for a late-night snack. A total of over 100,000 Legal Tender was spent that day, using the proceeds from pawning Xue's diamond ring and gold watch to pay the bill. After a day of revelry, Xue was hidden in the Municipal Government Guard Room at midnight, and a ransom of 20 million yuan was demanded. Xue agreed to pay 10 million yuan and wrote a note instructing his wife to send the money for negotiations. Xue's wife reported the case to the police, who solved the case and arrested the principal offender Zhang Yucan and accomplices Lu Bingyan, Zhang Zhengyuan, and Gao Zhenyu, and transferred them to the court. Zhang Yucan was sentenced to five years in prison, and Lu, Zhang, and Gao were each sentenced to three years in prison. Xue Jianqiu, on the other hand, was sentenced to six years in prison by the High Court for treason. Zhang and others refused to accept the sentence, stating that the crime of attempted kidnapping for ransom should be established based on whether there was an intention to extort money. The defendants kidnapped Xue and took him to the bustling city for a day of fun, which at most constituted the crime of fraud. They applied for a review by the High Court, and the High Court ruled for a retrial. The retrial opened in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Yucan flatly denied that there was a plan to kidnap Xue beforehand, and he was not carrying a gun that day. Because he was a traitor, I was going to send him to the Xincheng Police Station that day, but he didn't want to go, so he stayed in the Municipal Government Guard Room. Judge Shao Renjie, the presiding judge, asked if it was because he didn't get the money that he wanted to send him to the police station. Zhang replied, "It's not like that. Even if I got the money, I would still report him," showing a rather triumphant expression. Defendants Lu Bingyan, Zhang Zhengyuan, and Gao Zhenyu all testified that they had not discussed with Zhang beforehand and had not helped Zhang with extortion afterward. Xue Jianqiu was finally summoned. Xue was escorted to the court by bailiffs, wearing a gray wool robe, disheveled hair, and gold-rimmed glasses. He bowed deeply to the court and testified about the details of the kidnapping that day, saying that Zhang had claimed to be under the command of the Maritime Inspection Office of the Garrison Command and had come to arrest him, but after getting in the car, he ordered the soldiers to "go west," and they did not go to the Garrison Command at all. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled for another hearing.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the case of Ju Guangzao accused of fraud, yesterday the District Prosecutor's Office subpoenaed Ju Guangzao, Gu Jianyi, plaintiff Liu Shen Liying, Gu Chen, witnesses Yang Ding Xiuyun, Gu Guohua, Xu Jianqi, and others to the court for questioning. The most noteworthy among them was Gu Jianyi. Because Ju had repeatedly borrowed money from Liu Shen Liying and others, all in Gu's name, but he had never been seen. The District Prosecutor's Office had summoned him before, but he did not appear. Yesterday he suddenly reported to the court, stating that he had opened the Maohe Rice Mill in Liuzhao, Pudong, and due to financial difficulties, he asked Ju Guangzao and Yang Ding Xiuyun, the guarantors, to borrow five gold bars from Liu Shen Liying. By this spring, Gu had repaid two bars and still owed three bars. Gu wanted to repay according to the official price quoted by the Central Bank, but at that time the black market price of gold was soaring, with a huge difference, which caused the dispute. After investigation by the prosecutor, Ju Guangzao was still released on bail, and the others were dismissed.</p>

Due to owing the Chongqing branch of the Continental Bank more than 510 million Legal Tender, he used musk fritillary as collateral for the debt.

It was further discovered that Ge Junren, the manager of the Chongqing branch of the Continental Bank, was suspected of colluding with Zhang, and Ge has fled.

Eight months have swiftly passed, and our free maternity assistance campaign has garnered widespread support and sympathy. The number of hospitals cooperating with us has increased from one to four, namely Renhe Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital, and the recently added Baoli Hospital. Countless like-minded readers have provided us with financial assistance and moral support.</p>
<p>The work of "Free Maternity Assistance for Poor Women" is expanding and developing more broadly day by day. From February to October, we have assisted more than one hundred poor pregnant women. Fortunately, none of these women suffered the misfortune of death. Due to soaring prices and currency fluctuations, we have begun to feel the pinch of financial constraints and fundraising difficulties. On the other hand, the number of people applying for maternity assistance is increasing day by day, but we are not discouraged by this. We believe that continuous efforts will surely overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, on a clear autumn morning, we received a call from reader Mr. Jinhua Feng, who told us that he was willing to independently bear all the monthly expenses of our newspaper's maternity assistance for poor women. The next day, we discussed the implementation methods with him and formulated the guiding principles for the campaign.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin is a kind and amiable middle-aged businessman, with a humble and straightforward nature, and an especially honest and sincere attitude. Twelve years ago, he was a good friend of the late famous doctor Niu Huiqin. Admiring Mr. Niu's character and inspired by his spirit, he resolved to do good deeds, vowing to use his business earnings to relieve the suffering of his compatriots. Mr. Jin has been married for eighteen years without children, but suddenly had a son in early September this year, which of course gave him great comfort. From now on, we will no longer have to worry about the expenses for "maternity assistance funds," and countless poor pregnant women will also receive a safe guarantee.</p>

<h3>Reopening of the Paris Conference: Britain Expresses Strong Opposition</h3>
<p>The White House's hasty convocation of a meeting with U.S. Marshall Plan officials and the executive committee of the Paris Sixteen-Nation Economic Cooperation Committee coincided unexpectedly. Authoritative sources say that Britain is strongly opposed to the U.S. proposal to reopen the Paris Conference to approve the U.S.'s proposed amendments to the Paris Conference report. Sir Oliver Franks, the British representative, believes that the final decision on the European Recovery Program rests with the U.S. Congress. Therefore, first obtaining the consent of European countries to the U.S. government's amendments seems unwise and unnecessary.</p>
<h3>New Trade Agreements Concluded Between China and Canada, etc.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 13th] The preparatory committee of the International Trade Organization announced today that the Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg Customs Union has concluded a trade agreement with the United States, stipulating mutual tariff reductions. Detailed measures will be announced by the United Nations Secretariat on the 18th of next month. Other new agreements listed today include trade agreements between China and Canada, China and Cuba, China and New Zealand, Australia and Brazil, Cuba and Czechoslovakia, New Zealand and Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom and Czechoslovakia, and Lebanon and Syria with the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Lead Philippine Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 14th] The Bureau of Customs Statistics announced today that Chinese merchants are currently controlling the majority of the Philippines' foreign trade. According to recent statistics, Chinese merchants ranked first from April to July of this year, accounting for 33%, followed by American merchants.</p>
<h3>U.S. Export-Import Bank Approves France's Use of $180 Million; Truman's First Voice of Expedient Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] The U.S. Export-Import Bank took action on the 13th, approving France's use of $180 million in U.S. funds to purchase U.S. coal and other urgently needed raw materials to alleviate the Western European crisis. The loan is the unused portion remaining from the $650 million loan to France in May 1946, which was approved for use after French Ambassador to the U.S., Henri Bonnet, made an urgent appeal to President Truman. French procurement agencies have already signed contracts to use all of the funds for heavy machinery to revitalize France's export industry. The exact amount of assistance France can receive under the new regulations depends on the cancellation or extension of some of these contracts. President Truman announced last month that France and Italy would receive expedient aid this winter before the Marshall Plan is implemented. This is the first batch of funds given to Europe by the administrative departments of the U.S. government.</p>
<h3>Iranian Government Prevents Turmoil; Large Numbers of Suspected Communists Expelled</h3>
<p>Soviet Ambassador Visited Iranian Prime Minister, Meeting Ended Unhappily</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: Great Britain News: The Iranian government, deeply fearful of Soviet-instigated riots in the oil-rich Azerbaijan province, is currently exiling thousands of suspected communists to prevent the organization of a fifth column. Currently, 4,000 people have been exiled to western Iran. According to police authorities, another 4,000 people will be exiled in the next six weeks.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] It is reported that Soviet Ambassador, Saki Khikov, visited Iranian Prime Minister, Sultan Nadar, on Saturday to discuss the Soviet oil agreement. Because Sultan Nadar could not agree to submit the agreement to the parliament immediately, Saki Khikov stormed out in anger. Saki Khikov strongly argued that the terms of the agreement should not be changed and that the submission of the agreement to parliament should not be delayed any longer. Sultan Nadar urged Saki Khikov to be patient and stated that he should not only discuss the matter with members of parliament, but also with other important parties.</p>
<p>Paris Transport Workers Stage General Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 14th] Paris transport workers, encouraged by the communists, staged a general strike at 5:30 a.m. on the 14th. Subways, buses, and other vehicles are all suspended.

<h3>Japanese Demand Return of Greater Ryukyu Islands; Senate Decides to Postpone Temporarily; Hosokawa Suggests Residents of the Island Resolve Themselves</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The Japanese Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has decided to temporarily postpone the delicate issue of the residents of Greater Ryukyu Islands requesting that the islands be returned to Japan. They will make a decision after hearing more opinions from the people of the islands.</p>
<p>Following the second fierce debate in the Japanese Senate Foreign Affairs Committee regarding the appeal from 63 residents of the islands for their return to Japan, some senators considered the matter extremely delicate and proposed holding a closed-door meeting. However, Senate Speaker Sato Naotake, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, opposed the above suggestion, believing that the senators would adopt a cautious attitude when discussing this delicate issue. Hosokawa Kakuroku, a communist member of the committee, strongly opposed discussing the case, stating that history proves that Greater Ryukyu Islands were stolen by Japan between Meiji 4 and 12. He also claimed that the chiefs of the islands were forced, not voluntarily, to merge with Japan. Hosokawa is a famous Japanese commentator. He believes that the request of 63 residents of the islands is not representative of the opinions of the 1.2 million people on the islands globally, or even of the 200,000 people from the islands residing in Japan. He continued, stating that some people on the islands support merging with Japan, but some also support merging with China. Therefore, he suggests that the people of the islands resolve the matter themselves, and the Japanese Senate should not interfere. Speaker Sato, from the beginning of the meeting, attempted to prevent a serious debate on the issue. Therefore, he immediately announced a temporary postponement of the issue, pending the acquisition of more opinions from the residents of the islands.</p>

<h3>Taking Extraordinary Measures in Extraordinary Times; Full Investigation of Illegal Merchants; Commander Xuan Announces at Press Conference Yesterday; National Traitors Will Be Punished Most Severely</h3>
<p>Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu gave an important speech yesterday afternoon when he received a reporter from the Central News Agency, stating: In today's situation, we must admit that it is no longer an ordinary period, but an extraordinary one. Extraordinary economic fluctuations during extraordinary times should be dealt with by extraordinary measures, which may be able to save the crisis. Xuan announced to the reporter that he has decided to take two emergency measures: Yesterday, he summoned the chiefs of all intelligence brigades to discuss that, starting today, they will concentrate all their efforts on investigating illegal merchants who disrupt finance, monopolize the market, and raise prices. These people are greedy for personal gain to achieve superior enjoyment, disregarding the lives of the majority of the people. They are truly traitors to the nation, and the country and society do not need such people to exist. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished most severely. If the people of the country all say they should be killed, they will be put to death. There will be absolutely no leniency. As an example, Xuan stated that the free trading of gold banknotes is prohibited, but the black market exists blatantly and is extremely rampant. The daily black market quotations are spread everywhere. The most important target of the investigators is to investigate where these quotations come from and who sets them. He has set a deadline to break this place where black market quotations are generated and capture the mysterious figures behind the scenes. Xuan stated that what should be maintained now is the lives of the majority of law-abiding people, and those who exploit the lives of the majority of the people should be sacrificed. The necessities of life for the majority of the people are "food" and "clothing." Food is rice, and clothing is yarn. In terms of the production of rice and yarn in Shanghai and its vicinity, there is sufficient supply. The reason why these two items are lacking today is due to hoarding and manipulation by exploiters. He is currently drafting a measure to avoid the monopolization of rice and yarn by middlemen. The content of this measure, Xuan revealed, is that rice and yarn should be directly purchased and produced by the government, and directly distributed to the people, without going through the hands of merchants. In addition, by checking household registrations, he will thoroughly investigate people who hoard grain and yarn from house to house. Confiscate the goods found, and severely punish the offenders. In this way, Shanghai can be free of people hoarding a single dan of grain or a piece of yarn. After this measure is drafted, Xuan will discuss it with Mayor Wu and report it to the central government before implementing it. Xuan finally stated that financial control and price stabilization originally have competent authorities, but the result of financial chaos and price fluctuations will endanger public security. He is responsible for maintaining the city's public security and must "take precautions."</p>
<p>Spot Check on Seven Textile Manufacturers</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In order to implement the five measures instructed by the mayor to suppress the price of yarn, the Bureau of Economic Affairs dispatched all economic police officers yesterday morning, led by senior officials, along with personnel dispatched by the Textile Adjustment Committee, to conduct spot checks on the yarn allocation situation of various textile manufacturers in seven groups. The manufacturers that were spot-checked include Xinhuo Yarn Factory at 60 Mochanshan Road, Datong Yarn Factory at 223 Bingai Road, Guangqin Yarn Factory at 410 Mabai Road, Hengtong Yarn Factory at 68 Xichang Street in the South City, Zhang Shenghua at 1486 Ban'an Temple Road, Qin Xin Yarn Factory at 162 Father Du Road, and Hongzhang Yarn Factory at 381 Maigen Road. According to Xu, the chief of the Economic Affairs Section, the manufacturers that were spot-checked were all selected by the Textile Adjustment Committee before personnel from the section were dispatched to handle the matter. The principle of not harassing normal merchants was followed during the execution of the work, so the process yesterday was quite good. At the same time, the prices of cotton yarn and artificial silk have all fallen, but because full attention is focused on yarn and rice markets, they are still volatile. In addition to summoning the heads of the North and South markets to advise them, I will start a thorough investigation today.</p>
<h3>10,000 Dan of Raw Oil to Be Transported; 15,000 Dan of Rice Arriving; Mayor Advises Against Panic Buying</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu met with reporters at the Municipal Government at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, stating that the yarn market situation has fallen and will soon stabilize after deciding on emergency measures to strictly crack down on hoarding and speculation. The price of cooking oil has risen sharply recently. After consultation with the China Cooking Oil Company and with the approval of President Zhang via a long-distance phone call, 10,000 dan of raw oil will be transported from Qingdao to Shanghai to be distributed and sold jointly with the cooking oil from the China Vegetable Oil Factory to suppress the printing price. In addition, a telegram was sent to President Zhang, ordering the railway authorities to transport the large amount of soybeans currently at Zhapu, so that the oil price in the city can be lowered. As for the 100,000 tan of rice added by the Ministry of Food, the first batch of 15,000 tan has arrived in Shanghai and will be distributed to the people by the Civil Food Allocation Committee after deliberation. The recent rise in rice prices is not due to rice shortages. I hope that citizens can cooperate with the government and those with rice at home should not panic buy to avoid stimulation, so that the rice price can be stabilized.</p>
<p>Meeting of Oil Merchants Convened to Discuss Oil Conservation Measures</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Public Utilities Bureau convened a joint meeting of oil companies this morning to review whether the current use and refueling of automobile oil is reasonable or whether there are any difficulties, and to discuss conservation measures.

<h3>Yarn Association Consolidates Industry; Stipulates Five Points to Be Universally Observed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Economic Affairs Section of the Police Bureau summoned those in charge of the Cotton Yarn Association again yesterday to discuss the matter. In addition to advising them to voluntarily suppress prices, a broad discussion of the reasons for the recent price surge was also conducted. According to the Cotton Cloth Association, the reasons for the market price increase are: 1. Lack of sources for domestic cotton and obstructed transportation, resulting in rising production prices. 2. Foreign cotton is difficult to settle in foreign exchange, and goods are disappearing. 3. Fuel and pigments have all risen dramatically. 4. Insufficient power, reduced production. 5. High wages, increased expenses. 6. The autumn season is in season, and supply cannot meet demand. In the future, the way to suppress prices should be through official-business cooperation, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. In addition to unblocking cotton sources, increasing yarn production, adjusting cotton yarn negotiated prices, and distributing them to distribution manufacturers as much as possible, attention should also be paid to tightening monetary policy, lowering interest rates, and suppressing the selling price of fuel and pigments. The association notified its members yesterday afternoon, stipulating the implementation of the following points: 1. All transactions in the market must be accompanied by a transaction slip, accurately stating the membership numbers of both the buyer and seller, and submitted to the association for verification. 2. Those without market escorts are strictly prohibited from entering the market. 3. Non-industry personnel are strictly prohibited from entering the market to buy and sell. 4. Notify the Brokers Association to advise its members to abide by these rules. 5. If there are any violations, all members should supervise each other. Responsible South will raise.</p>

The first phase of rice distribution to occupational workers has been extended to the 20th of this month. 3. The second phase will be started immediately after the first phase of rice distribution is completed. 4.

<h3>Many Speculations on the Reasons for Xiao Danggui's Suicide</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Xiao Danggui, a famous Yue opera veteran, suddenly committed suicide at her home in Songjia Lane, Beijingshi, the day before yesterday afternoon. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Xiao Ling's body was transported from the Zhongmei Hospital to the coroner's office at 2:00 a.m. yesterday. At 8:00 a.m., the police bureau requested the prosecutor's office to send someone to examine the body. At 9:00 a.m., the body was transported to the Lewen Funeral Home, and the major encoffining ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow at noon. From noon to dusk yesterday, there were many friends and relatives who came to mourn, especially Jin City Yue opera fans who came to view the remains. There was an endless stream. Among the top ten Yue opera actresses, except for Yin Guifang, who went abroad last month, Yuan Xuefen, Fan Ruijuan, Fu Quanxiang, Xu Tianhong, Zhang Guifeng, Xiao Lou, Zhu Shuijuan, and Xu Wanglan all arrived to pay their respects and mourned loudly over the body. Zhang Xiangxiang, Xiao Ling's former supporting actor, as well as Yue opera actresses Jia Lingfeng, Xiao Lingfeng, Xu Xuqin, Chen Peixiang, Wei Guanfang, Bai Mudan, Gao Wufang, Bi Xiaolou, and Xiao Yuee, were all sobbing with their faces covered. Xiao Ling's body was originally scheduled to be encoffined today, but because her family members need to wait for her brother, Qian Boquan, to come to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony, it has been postponed until tomorrow. Her sister, Qiong Yun, is guarding the coffin, sobbing sadly. Zhang Chunfan, her husband, according to reporters, was showing signs of mental instability in the funeral home yesterday afternoon. All the Yue opera actresses in the city are suspicious of the reasons for Xiao Ling's suicide, believing that there must be grievances, and there are moves to appeal to all sectors for justice. All the Yue opera actresses in the city will suspend their performances tomorrow to attend Xiao Ling's major encoffining ceremony to mourn her. The so-called five Dan of the Yue opera veteran faction are Shi Yinhua, Cao Ruihua, Wang Xinghua, Yao Shuijuan, and Xiao Ling. Moreover, Xiao Qing is better than blue, and is admired by the Yue opera actresses, so there is a saying that three flowers are not as good as one Juan, and one Juan is not as good as one Gui, which shows Xiao's status. Yesterday, there were many speculations from all parties about the reasons for Xiao Ling's suicide. Some said that Xiao's performance was slightly worse in the joint performance of the "Mountain and River Love" drama this summer by the top ten golden actresses, which caused criticism and was stimulated. Others said that it was due to the collapse of the building wall of the Cathay Yue Opera Theater, which affected the performance. Still others said that Xu Yulan's blocking made Xiao Ling feel unhappy, and even others said that Xiao was too strictly controlled, which led to her loss of freedom. As for economic difficulties, they are secondary.</p>
