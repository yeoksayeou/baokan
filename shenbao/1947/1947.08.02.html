<h3>我國參加參日貿易國務會決定三原則　規定不妨害我國民經濟</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕開放對日貿易問題，一日在國務會議中曾有熱烈縝密之研討，並獲具體結論，首由張院長以政院擬訂之提案予以說明，各委分別發言，僉認居於戰勝國地位之我國，與戰敗國之日本不應有互相通商之舉，亦即吾人不能購買日貨，僅能輸入日賠償物資，故不能稱爲「開放」，而係恢復其私人貿易。經討論後，對原案內容不予同意，另行決定三項原則：（一）政府與經濟界共同協商並組私人代表團赴日考察。（二）對日貿易之進出口貨物，規定以不妨害中國國民經濟爲原則。（三）中國對日所需要之物資，應盡量在賠償物資內提取。又盟軍總部乃係邀我私人商家恢復對日貿易，我國則向採取管制商業政策，故目前之貿易，係在自由貿易條件下，採取管制辦法，該案當即付予通過，其貿易辦法及組織，由政院負責擬訂。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕國務會議一日晨通過有條件開放對日貿易案後，外部發言人稱：該部已準備執行一切爲旣定國策所需之任務，包括訓令註日代表團向盟軍總部交涉考察團入境之許可等，俾該團可如期抵日，開始工作</p>
<p>〔聯合徵信所南京一日電〕一日晨國務會議，決定對日貿易即將恢復，據悉：吾國準備輸出茶葉，桐油，豬鬃，樟腦，糖等一部份剩餘物資，希望自日本獲得枕木，機器，儀器交通工具，窰木等。幷計劃對日輸出物資價値爲輸八之二倍。又爲保護我國南洋市塲起見，政府當局正計劃對銷往該地之物品，採取變相補貼辦法，求能减低成本。</p>
<h3>行政院發言人談貿易案成立經過　赴日代表團與經濟界協商組織</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕記者頃向行政院探詢對日貿易案成立經過，承行政院發言人詳述如下：</p>
<p>自該案由於監察委員等提出後，行政院曾開院會兩次討論，第一次原決議參加，後因國民參政會駐會委員之提議及上海市商會，中國全國工業協會等團體提出意見，所以在第二次院會時再提出討論，雖決議參加，仍呈請國務會議，將政院之決議與國民參政會建議案等合併討論，可見政府對於此案之處理乃十分愼重。</p>
<p>記者請求發言人將參加之理由詳細說明，俾社會人士明瞭眞相，該發言人繼稱：我國參加對日貿易，並非自此案決定後開始，去年中央信託局即曾以物物交換方式對日通商，去年及本年度對日進出口比較，大體平衡。國務會議決定組織赴日商務代表團，不過將中央信託局所從事對日貿易工作稍爲擴大而巳。此種商務代表團，其名額及人選旣由行政院與經濟界協商組織，則可說仍爲一種有管制之貿易，並非完全私人自由貿易。此外，一般人對此事之誤會，在認此次所謂開放對日貿易與通常之貿易開放相同，其實，此次開放辦法，只許盟國代表團派往日本，並非日本亦可派商務代表團或私人來中國（或其他盟國）貿易，日商之與盟國代表團貿易者，並須經盟軍總部之核准，故此次所謂開放對日貿易，實有極嚴之限制。</p>
<p>記者再問將來我國參加對日貿易後，日本是否可以其消費品或其他妨害我國國民經濟之物品奪取我國之外匯，據發言人答稱，我國對外貿易，尤其對於輸入方面，原有各種限制，並設有輸入管理委員會，執行管理。國務會議決議案第二項，更鄭重規定對日貿易轍入輸出種類數量，務以不妨害中國國民經濟爲標準，在此種限制之下，益以商務代表團將由政府選定之團員組成，日貨傾銷我國之事，絕不可能。至於外匯對日貿易自與對其他各國之貿易相同，仍受一般管理外匯辦法之約束。此等管制外匯辦法，實爲保障我國工商業之必要措施，况且國務會議第三項決定，我國對於所需物資，應儘可能先在賠償物資中取得，目前賠償問題，因關係國家意見尙未能完全一致，所以對日本整個賠償問題，尙無正式決定，惟先期拆遷辦法決定後，我國仍可繼續交涉以日本今後生產亦充賠償之一部份，希望我國所需物資能於賠償中多取一分，則我國對日所需要之物資可减少一部份之負担。</p>
<p>記者又問，一般人士頗有主張對日貿易須在對日和約簽訂之後，蓋在簽訂和約時，可對日本對我通商作合理之限制，今不待和約訂立即與通商，而又加以各項限制，其根據何在？發言人續稱：日本貿易開放，由我國所參加發表之波茨坦宣言及遠東委員會對日基本政策統一許其參加，蔣主席於日本投降後之廣播所聲明採取寬大之處置，故盟軍總部開放日本貿易與我國之參加，均依據此三種文件，况且照遠東委員會所定之基本政策，聲明在佔領期閱，在適當管制下，並在優先滿足曾經參加對日作戰各國人民需要條件下，日本得自國外輸入爲和平目的所需之原料及其他貨物，如此可知參加對日貿易實爲滿足雙方面之要求，但以滿足曾經參加對日作戰各國人民需要爲優先之條件，故可說我國參加對日貿易是以滿足我國需要爲主，蕊於以上種種理由，國務會議乃有此種決定。</p>
<h3>改組後資源委會　即召開首次會議</h3>
<p>將討論工業總動員</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕資源委會定四日舉行改組後之第一次委員會議，委員十五人均將來京出席，由翁文灝主持，會期暫定一日，上午檢討，下午討論提案。此次會議主要爲檢討該會改組後之一般業務，並討論各項基本工鑛事業建設之方向，區域之分配及工業總動員辦法等問題，該會委負吳蘊初，將於會議中提出國營工鑛事業如何與民營事業密切聯繫並合作之提案。</p>
<h3>行政座談會　昨繼續舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕政院於一日下午九時，開第四次行政座談會，各有關部會首長及各省主席均出席，張院長主持，對各省行政問題續有商討。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕行政院昨晚九時繼續舉行第三次行政座談會，先由財政部徐次長報吿地方財政情形，徐次長說明財政部近日與各省來京之財政廳長舉行會談二次。對於地方財政，曾加檢討，並有改進意見提出報吿。嗣請徐主計長發言，徐主計長對地方機構人事制度，均有指示。繼沈主席鴻烈，王主席東原，各有申述。張院長於分別詳細指示後，分別請內政部張部長，教育部朱部長，農林部左部長，水利部薛部長，各就主管範圍，對省主席所提出之問題，加以解答。交通部份由兪部長說明，另與各省主席分別商談，各主席希望再有一次談話，繼續商討未了事項。</p>
<h3>滬江校長潛憲揚　在丹京發表演說</h3>
<p>請以馬卿計劃援華</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：滬江大學校長凌憲揚，在丹麥京城哥本哈根浸禮會世界同盟第七屆大會中發表演說，爲東亞五十萬浸禮會教徒請命，籲請美人以馬歇爾計劃施諸中國，以濟迫切之需要。凌氏邀請浸禮會同盟第八屆大會於一九五二年在中國舉行，謂彼時中國經濟情形將入於正軌云。</p>
<h3>國府委會第八次會議　經濟改革案　常乃惪氏決予明令褒揚</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕經濟改革方案，一日在國務會議中通過，該案前經全經會審查修正，故國務會議中僅略作研討後，即照原修正案通過（全文見廿三廿四兩日本報）。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕國府委員一日上午十時在國府會議廳舉行第八次國務會議，蔣主席親自主持，到委員孫科，張羣，居正，戴傳賢，于右任，翁文灝，王寵惠，邵力子，王世杰，蔣夢麟，鈕永建，吳忠信，曾琦，余家菊，莫德惠，王雲五等十七人，司法院副院長李文範，監院副院長黃紹竑，財政部長兪鴻鈞，經部長陳啓天，文官長吳鼎昌，參軍長薛岳，主計長徐堪均列席，首依議程所列宣讀報吿事項：（一）中法關於修增中越航空綫臨時辦法換文案。（二）我國對義賠償要求及義國政府暨人民在華所特有若干產權之處理問題，雙方協議換文案。（三）國民參政會駐會委員會第三次會議建議處理辦法案。（四）裝源縣改列安徽省第二選舉區案。（五）本府常委員乃惠病逝成都，經奉主席電唁，並決定明令褒揚案。次由委員兼外長王世杰報吿最近外交近情（見另條），旋即討論議案：（一）全國經濟委員會審查修正經濟改革方案，決議原則通過，交行政院分別辦理。（二）海南特別區行政長官公署組織條例草案，決議通過，交立法院。（三）平津冀區軍紀吏治督察團組織規程草案，決議通過。（四）任命黃鳳池爲監察院監察委員案，決議通過。（五）卅七年度中央政府總預算編審辦法草案，決議通過。（六）其他各機關財政預算案多起，均通過。至十二時五十分散會。</p>
<h3>印自治領成立　我決派使往賀</h3>
<p>王世杰報吿最近外交</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕外長王世杰一日在國務會議報吿最近外交情况，略稱：（一）對日和約問題，目前尙視蘇方之態度，我國並無意見。（二）印度定八月十五日宣布自治領成立，我國已決派使往賀。（三）北塔山事件頃仍在調查中。（四）外蒙要求加入聯合國，我對其威脅和平，破壞和平之行爲，將予公布。（五）印度巴力斯坦回民政府成立，政府擬於日內派使前往。（六）歐洲希南邊境衝突問題，聯合國擬組調查國，以明眞相，惟蘇已拒絕參加，美政府對此甚爲重視。王氏並提書而報告兩件：（一）德義和約，（二）美詢問對華投資規則我方之答覆。</p>
<h3>卜訥榮博士　談美人觀感</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕來華考察之遠東問題專家卜訥榮（見圖）博士，爲一在美生長之華僑，其祖籍爲吉林省。卜博士爲一教授，作家及演說家，在美國哈佛大學執教，著作甚多，並爲「現代史料」雜誌寫作，頗負聲名。卜氏頃晤記者時表示：「本定下星期一晋京，但　潘議長邀宴，改於星期二成行。本人在華擬作一廣泛之游歷及考察，可能時將至華北及東北一行；除擬與政府首要及各界領袖晤談外，並擬深入農村，探詢人民之生活情況及改革途徑。本人此次來華，費用完全自理，希望獲得祖國之眞正情况，帶回美國，使彼等人民對中國能有一正確之瞭解。因一般美人對我國之觀察殊不正確，對我國之政治局勢，僅知蔣主席確爲一忠誠偉大之人物，但其孤立無助，爲若干頑固份子所包圍，而今日政府之種種改革，均嫌不够澈底。一言以蔽之，美人對中國官吏尙欠信任，此類意見對於政府之決策甚有影嚮。此次魏德邁特使之來華，即來調查以上之傳說是否爲事實。渠如發現我國政府對改革確有誠意，則本人深信美政府不僅願意借款，且將進一步全力援華。卜訥榮博士又稱：「美國一般人士對於中共之觀念，主要得之於斯諾及霍脫等左翼作家之書籍，視中共爲一進步之政黨，爲人民之利益而奮鬥。本人此次返國，決定實地考察而不假手於人，俾將祖國之眞相查明，提供於美國友人之前。又卜氏定九月中旬返美。</p>
<h3>中和黨招待報界　表對時局宣言</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕中國中和黨一日下午三時在京招待新聞界，報吿該黨歷史與革命過程，並發表中和黨對時局之宣言。據談，該黨成立於民國紀元前廿三年國慶日，始終以中國全民政治之實現爲一貫主張，並曾與當時孫中山先生領導下之同盟會，共同推翻滿淸，建立共和，旋並參加北伐，共同抗戰。該黨主張政治之民主化，須以「軍隊國家化」爲先決條件，以「經濟民主化」爲實際依歸。該黨宣言中，指陳對現勢之主張與急要措施：（一）對國內之緊急主張：1擁護政府總動員令，戡亂建國。2迅謀幣値穩定與幣制改革，搶救工商危機。3農村救濟應即澈底訂定方案，迅付實施。4國內各政黨應立排除異見，與能眞正實行三民主義之友黨各派合作。（二）國際方面之緊急主張：1對美蘇兩國之外交，應進一步作切實之聯繫。2充分發揮國民外交精神。3切實實行眞正民主政治，以充分獲得國際政治上之良好淸議同情援助</p>
<h3>蔣主蒿電唁　俞再麟家屬</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕蔣主席頃電唁兪再麟家屬云：錦州兪故處長追悼大會並轉兪再麟先生家屬禮鑒：據報再麟處長於北票煤礦壯烈殉職，曷勝驚愕，吾國煉焦專家素極缺乏，社會培調非易，政府愛護不遑，乃共匪殘賊成性，輕予戕害，洵爲國家莫大之損失，大會沉痛追悼，實具同感，除飭從優議卹以慰英靈外，特電致唁。</p>
<h3>陳誠宴各省主席</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕據軍聞社訊：陳誠總長一日午在官邸歡宴各省主席，黃鎭球，林蔚等作陪，賓主備極歡洽，一時半始散。</p>
<h3>權威方面秀露消息　年內或將改革幣制</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京一日電〕四聯總處頃引權威方面之消息稱，中國或將於本年內發行一種新的「管理貨幣」。據悉：經濟部長陳啓天曾向魏德邁代表團建議發行新幣，可以成爲制止通貨膨脹之萬靈藥。四聯總處繼稱，發行新幣將引起重大之反應，故政府自將審愼從事，若謂採取金本位，則在中國並不能實行，蓋此須與自由外匯相輔並行。此則殆將使資金逃避中國。至於是否將取得美國借款，以支持此將發行之新貨幣，則尙無從確切探明政府與魏德邁代表團是否已在進行談判。據國府某部長吿本社訪員稱，中國發行新幣之唯一困難乃爲缺乏資金。另一高級官員答覆本社訪員關於中國需要若干資金始可支特新幣一項詢問稱，此需五萬萬美元至十萬萬美元。</p>
<h3>劉翰東等請辭　主席特電留</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽一日電〕遼北省主席劉翰東及各廳長等，因困難重車，聯名請辭。蔣主席特電慰留，劉等定二日返四平。</p>
<h3>銀行法　暫緩公布</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕銀行法前經立院完成立法程序，爲時業已三月，惟尙未經國府明令公布施行，立院曾一再催請公布，國務會議一日提出討論後，認爲該法規定銀行之設立範圍較寬，宜適用於平時，際此總動員令頒布後，與即將公布施行之經濟改革方案管制金融容有不合，決議暫緩公布。</p>
<h3>李宗仁等返抵平　擾談華北局勢可望改善　王鴻韶已辭職競選立委</h3>
<p>〔本報北平一日電〕李宗仁偕新任行轅副主任吳奇偉，參謀長徐啓明，於一日正午十二時半目京飛返平。李談華北軍政機構無變動，另設剿匪機構說不確，今後將續有國軍北運，華北情勢可望改善。李否認渠將競選副總統及桂·皖主席與動說。繼稱，參謀長王鴻韶因競選立委，已辭職，惟任副主任說不確。吳奇偉接見記者稱，渠已退役，今係再着戎裝。十七年曾來故都，今舊地重游，深惑愉快。</p>
<h3>煤炭增產會議開幕　經長陣啟天說明會目的</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕經濟部爲煤斤增產而召開之全國煤炭增產會議，一日晨在京正式開幕，經部長陳啓天親臨主持，出席各機關及各單位代表五十二人。首由陳部長致詞，說明召開會議之目的，略調：由於北方戰局關係，南北交通受阻，本部有鑒於此，爲事先預防計，特有本會之召集，期能集合各地單位負責人，在資金，器材，外匯，運輸，安全等問題上，共商如何增產，俾長江流域民用，公用及工廠用煤不致發生困難。並進而謀求使煤斤能有積貯，俾工業得以繼續發展，此爲召開此次會議之第一目的，長江流城煤斤若能自給自足，不再仰給華北，則不特華中工業獨立有望，抑且可以華北多餘之煤斤外銷，此爲第二目的，再次，政府對煤斤管制，戰後已較抗戰時鬆弛多多，然仍有待加以檢討之處，俾公私兩便，此爲召開此次會議之又一目的。最後，煤炭之問題，不使在煤炭本身，運輸亦有重大關係，例如開濼存煤三十萬噸無法運出，而其他各地又感煤斤缺乏，如何使海陸運輸得以暢通，俾有無得以互通，亦爲本次會議主要目的。陳氏結論稱：動力工業中，最重要者莫過於煤斤，諸君試想，若一旦煤斤斷絕，京滬一帶水，電，運輸全陷停頓，將成何種現象，深盼與會諸君對煤斤自給自足，尤其是長江流域自足爲多所眷獻。</p>

<p>行政院長張羣訓詞　增產運輸同肅重要</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕行政院長張羣於經濟部煤炭增產會議開幕席上，頒致訓詞稱：「煤炭是工業和交通的原動力，尤其是在石油資源缺乏的我國，工業建設計劃的實施，是否能達到預定的進度，煤炭會量和計劃進度的配合，實在是一個最重要的關鍵。同時，現在是剿共軍事積極進行的時期，煤炭的產量，尤其必須和軍事運輸的要求配合，才能够迅速弭平禍亂。目下煤炭增產自然是相當的困難，我國的重要煤礦，大部在華北和東北各省，而這些地方正是共匪擾亂最烈的區域，共匪所倒的地區，凡有煤礦都被破壞無餘，因此，全國各地現有的煤炭生產，不能供應當前工業與鐵路，輪航運輸的需要。本年度不够的數量約爲六百萬噸，在國家財政十分困難的今天，還需要大量的外匯來購買這種在國內蘊藏豐管的物資，實在是非常不合理的現象，這種現象，必須在一個是短期間予以澈底的改善。我們今天壽劃增產的目的，不僅在達到目前需要的數量，尤共要配合着國家未來的建設計劃的進度，爲遞進的增產。煤炭增產的籌劃，由於時局的不靖，交通的阻隔，當然存在着許多的困難，而且許多問題都不在增產的本身，如上年度各礦因交通阻隔無法運出的存煤數十萬噸，爲了供應各工業區域的需要，反從越南，澳洲，加革大購進五十萬噸，由此可見當前的問題不僅在增產，運輸亦同樣重要，如何補救供需脫節的問題，惟有着重於分區取給辦法，可是工桀發展的地區，並不一定即是煤產豐富的地區，例如京滬及滬杭綫是工業最發達的地區，而煤產是並不豐富，這一切問題，都有待於煤礦企業家和專家的從長計議。即如設備的擴充，技術的增進，勞工生活的改善，都可補救天賦的不足，深盼能各本經騐及認識，協商迅速生效增產及供應辦法」。</p>

<h3>清算十五年血債　平頂山發掘遺骸</h3>

<h3>關於對日和約問題　我國取審慎態度　正式和會應在上海舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕外部發言人一日證實我國對於美國召開對日和約初步會議邀請之覆文，早於七月十七提出，唯覆文全文，目前仍不擬發表。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京一日電〕中國希望對日和約會議在中國境內舉行，並堅持一種表決方式，可使蘇聯　任何一國，不能阻碍會議之進行。據曾就對日和約問題交換意見之外交界方面稱，中國外交部專家擬提出初步願望如下：（一）正式和約會議應在中國境內舉行，大約在上海。（二）對日作戰有關各國均應出席和會，不僅限於美英蘇中四國。（三）正式和會之表決手續，須經出席代表之過半數及四强中的四分之三通過，方可成立。此一手續對於任何一國企圖阻撓和會時尤有效力。據外交部方面吿聯合社記者稱，中國對於和約問題之觀點，完全取審愼態度，並不急於簽訂對日和約。中國受日本侵略，記憶猶新，決不容忘却新侵略之危險。吾人必須確知和約能保障中國及亞洲其他各國，將來不再受日本野心之害。中國所擬表決方案，將在美國不久召開之初步會議中首次提出。外部已訓令駐美大使顧維鈞通知美國政府，中國願與合作，就對日和約初步交換意見。中國政府因內亂未息，及經濟不安，深恐和約縱不致令日本恢復其在遠東之軍事地位，亦將爲其經濟復興之先聲。</p>

<h3>社論　速謀燃料的自給！</h3>
<p>今日而提出我國的燃料自給，怕是一件不可能的事：然而燃料自給，應該是我們此後的國策－－我們總得朝這惆方向行進纔是。液體燃料，不用說，我們仰給於國外：就是煤，我們亦得仰給於國外。越南東京的媒，荷印蘇門答臘的媒，在像我們這樣缺乏外匯資金的今日，還不斷輸入來供應我們的市塲，怎不令我們感到隱痛或憂慮！今後我們的一切努力，必應集中在謀我們的自給自足；其中一個主要的項目，無疑地，便是燃料的自給自足。這是在這惆意義下，我們歡迎有像煤礦增產會議這一種集會的召開。據報傳消息，此一會議之召開，在謀補救華北東北媒斤來源的阻斷：是其目的，與燃料自給的鵠的，固相差甚遠；但政府能於此際有此項會議的召開，對煤的增產作有計劃的檢討，和通盤的計劃，不得不說是一件足以令人欣慰的事。</p>
<p>本來中國所已經營而有相當規模的媒礦，原多聚在華北，以及東北，開　，中興，井陘，焦作，以及北票等礦，都在華北。馳名世界的撫順，更不必說。然而浙江的長興，江西的萍鄉，原也馳名全國的產媒之區。共中萍鄕的煤，與大冶的鐵，漢陽的鋼，合成而爲漢冶萍，在我國經濟史上，其地位的重要，原可與德國的魯爾區相比擬；浙江的長興煤礦，爲東南著名的煤區，早年經營，投資甚鉅，我們所不懂的是：勝利迄今，轉瞬兩年，常我國燃料匱乏的時候，未聞對萍鄉長興兩礦的積極經營，這不知究竟是否政府對於煤礦的經營缺乏整個的政策呢？還是其中別有原因？</p>
<p>不錯，長興及萍鄉的媒，它們在生產及運輸上，容或都有問題；但是這些問題是否全不能解答？我們認爲其中主要的問題還是一個政策，及效率的問題。自資源委員會成立以來，全國的礦產資源，縱不完全由資源委員會直接經營，也得總命於該會；這對人民不能不說是一個相當的打擊。萍鄉媒礦的停頓，據傳是由於漢冶萍的冶鐵部份改歸國營，而聯帶受了影響，這里的問題是：若果漢冶萍整個改歸國營，何以可以容許萍鄉媒礦的停頓？這還是政府的沒有政策呢？還是行政效率的低落？至於講到浙江的長興媒礦，當初煞費經營。並且自建鐵道，便利煤運：在此需媒孔急的時候，坐令荒廢，這又不知究竟是什麼原因？</p>
<p>此次媒礦增產會議的召開，雖不免令入有燃眉救急之感。然而就是救急，我們希望他們能够有辦法拿出來；而且辦法所可貴的不僅在拿得出來，更在積極的辦，和辦的通。我們更希望的是：由於此次媒礦增產會讓的召開，進而能速謀燃料的自給，等到我們可以不依賴輸入燃料的時候，纔能算達到我們的目的。</p>
<h3>對日貿易的開放</h3>
<p>開放對日貿易問題，業經昨日國務會議通過；是此案的討論階段，業經終了，將進入於如何開放的問題。</p>
<p>這裏應該注意研究的地方，自然很多；而其最爲迫切者有二事：（一）爲對日輸出入物資的種類，（二）爲赴日考察團的人選。</p>
<p>我們認爲輸入物資，應限於我國所沒有或產量甚少的東西：其要在可以供給我們迫切的需要，而又不至與國貨發生競爭，致妨碍國貨工廠的生存。至輸出一項，自以我們所多餘，而不必自己利用者爲主。至於是否爲原料，爲成品，這關係尙屬次要。</p>
<p>其次，關於考察團的人選，除興對日貿易有關的主管機關，自應就研究有紫人員，酌派參加外，應以多派工商界代表，而且以實際從事實業，學識經騐並富的人士爲妥。我們的意見，以爲此項人員，最好由國貨廠商自行推舉；因爲一切利弊得失，他們知道得最淸楚，亦只有他們比較的最關切。其過去專做東洋生意的媚日份子，和一般馬路政客，時髦官僚，恐怕他們另有作用，不一定處處會在民族工業的大前提上打算的。</p>
<p>很有人顧慮到：對日貿易一經開放，東洋貨便會源源湧入：將逐漸回復到日貨傾銷的戰前現象。這在進出口貿易嚴格管制之下的今日日，似乎是一種過慮。不過外貨走私，於今爲烈：香港這個轉口港，又是現在管制貿易上的一個大漏洞，在對日貿易開放以後，切盼當局採取進一步的嚴峻措置，勿使有限制的輸入，變成非正式的無限制開放。</p>

<h3>洪偉烈被殺案　仇殺成份多於情殺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕海　路中國殯議館的大禮堂，昨日下午四時明星閃爍，金燄，劉瓊，裴冲，白璐，王人美，韓蘭根及大導演費穆，吳永　等數十位電影界從業員都懷着一腔悲愴的心情、追悼在七月廿九日晚被狙擊身亡的名攝影師洪偉烈。偌大的一個禮堂，僅僅四十多個人，更加顯得凄凉，洪偉烈自從棄影從商十年來，與電影界朋友疏遠了，他的一般老友對此次不幸事件的發生，除希望早日破案外，沒有任何意見，也不能供給任何綫索，但是他們從洪偉烈的個性，家庭，與經濟環境上判斷，與其說這是情殺案，還不如說仇殺案比較近於情理，因爲洪偉烈今年已四十七歲了，並且已經有了七個兒女。</p>
<p>平日愛好攝影　洪偉烈的投身電影界還是在默片時代，他曾經留學日本，學的是陸軍，但平日愛好攝影，而且對攝影術很有研究，歸國後即集資創設一個電影公司，其後復加入聯華公司担任攝影師，從此聲譽日奢，他拍攝影片時特別注意光源，匠心別具，使　惡的變成美麗，呆板的變成活潑，替中國電影攝影史上創一新紀元。民國廿五年他加入「中電」，第一部拍攝「密電碼」，曾經轟動一時，他的攝影術再度得到新評價。抗戰初期剪攝戰地新聞片，「中華兒女」與「長空萬里」都是他的名作，也是他的最後作品。民國卅一年「長空萬里」問世，他就在那時候脫離了電影界，因爲家庭負担，這使他找尋比攝影更隊錢的職業。</p>
<p>來滬經營商業　抗戰勝利他隨范紹增將軍來滬，住在杜美路十一號范公館，但他的家眷還留在重慶上淸寺范將軍故居，沒有帶來上海。他與范將軍的認識並不太久，民國廿七年「中電」從武漢撤退遜到重慶，沒有攝影塲，范將軍却有一個室內網球塲，若稍加改裝便是一個理想的攝影棚，經「中電」的要求，范將軍慨然允許借用，洪偉烈便在那時候認識了范將軍，因爲常常伴同范將軍打球出　，感情日漸深密，他豪爽，直率而當正義感的個性，深爲范將軍賞識，所以勝利以後就在范將軍裕增貿易公司中任職，洪的這次被殺，范將軍也十分痛心，一切喪殮善後費用均由范將軍斥資料理。</p>
<p>比前更形沉默　外傳這次慘案的發生，起因於桃色糾紛，因洪偉烈曾經與舞女沈英一度同居，但經警局偵查結果，並沒有從沈英身上發現新綫索。他長子洪文達恰巧在他被暗殺的前不多時從重慶到上海來投考大學，對他父親突然被狙擊，除了悲痛以外，更不能說些什麼。洪偉烈的一位親戚女太太說她最後一次與他會面時，洪偉烈情緒很不佳，說自己身體不大好，而且比以前更沉默，這點也不能說是他對被殺的預感，至於傳聞他在數日前向朋友借手槍防身等傳說，在警局的偵查未終結前，更不能確定對慘案有多大關係。但據一般人推測這案十，表面複雜，實則簡單，不南有水落石出的一天。</p>

<h3>警局新舊局長　舉行交接典禮　吳市長主持遞授印信</h3>

<p>吳市長致詞　感謝宣司令</p>
<p>吳市長致訓，略謂：（一）宣司令兼任警局長已閱政年餘，主持接收工作，備當艱辛，接收以後，更努力維護治安，使上海在複雜情形下得以安定，本人深表感謝，亦爲上海四百萬市民所同感。宣司令因身體關係，數度辭職，此次由中央核准辭去兼職，唯宣司令仍負責上海治安重任，今後常仍能予以合作。（二）新任兪局長過去　贊宣司令維護地方安全，亦已兩年餘，對地方情形素爲熟悉，此後對本市　政工作，將更有建樹。</p>
<p>對全體警員　有兩點願望</p>
<p>當此新舊局長交替之際，　　　警事件發生，現中央已派大員來滬澈查，必能按照國法辦理。然此案發生後一般市民感想，對於上海安全保障頓失信心，希望警察各分局全體警員，注意恢復市民信心，第一要盡責任，第二要明是非，站在自己崗位上努力，保特過去光榮之信譽，在新局長領導下更有特別表現。</p>
<p>宣前局長　臨別贈言</p>
<p>繼由宣前局長致辭，追述在任兩年來，賴上下一致精神團結，而在工作上有顯著收獲，表示欣慰並感謝，並以「動以負責，儉以養廉，公以處事，誠以待人」，爲臨別贈言。後由兪局長致詞，略謂追隨宣司令兩年來，工作未有若何貢獻，殊感慚愧，今後當本着宣　　。指示方針與工作精神，在賢明吳市長指導下，盡忠守職，願與同仁共勉。</p>
<p>新舊局長交接典禮</p>
<p>十時十分禮成後，新舊任局長在該局七樓俱樂部辦理交接手續，由市府參事葛克信監交。宣局長領導警局各處長交代，兪局長飭各處長「原交原接」。交接手續完成，宣兪兩局長在八樓召集各分局長訓話，至十一時許，兪局長率同全體僚屬恭送宣前局長。離局</p>
<p>俞警局長發表今後施政方針</p>
<p>新任警局長兪叔平就職後，兪局長對今後施政方針，發表書面談話如下：「（一）對於今後施政方針，仍當依照宣前局長所訂之施政綱要，及原定工作計劃繼續實施。（二）宣前局長以堅忍不拔與親愛精誠之精神，感召吾人，今後自當一本初衷，秉承其意旨辦理。（三）爲</p>
<p>充實警力，一面提高警士素質，繼續加强訓練，一面整肅員警風紀，提高服務道德。（四）警政之設施，當與整惆市政相配合，今後惟有力求聯緊，以發揮工作效能。（五）際此物價飛漲，警員生活艱苦，辦理</p>
<p>員警福利事業自爲要務。（六）本局原有人事，均係兩年來同甘苦共患難工作同志，希望一本初衷，安心服務。（七）金都戲院不幸事件之發生，警局遭受如此重大之損失，</p>
<p>深　痛惜竭盼中央大員在最短時間內作妥善合理之處置。（八）本市警察工作，責重事繁，自分材輕，深懼勿勝，幸在賢明市長及宜司令領導之下，秉承有自，並希各人上多予協助與鼓勵，籍免隕越。」</p>
<p>又該局各處長及各分局長，並無更動。原任人事室主任徐旭辭職照准，經市府調任人事室第三科長吳傑繼任，昨已到任視事。</p>

<h3>美國人看明年世運　〇徑賽可獨佔鰲頭　瑞展芬蘭是二勁敵</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約航訊〕美國人深信他們在倫敦明年舉行的世界運動會中，可以得佔鰲頭，瑞典將屈居第二，而芬蘭將獲得比數接近的第三位。</p>
<p>美國體育界人士對世界運動會的估計，是：美國在長距離徑賽方面，將要失敗，但是在短跑同着重技巧的節目方而，美國可以獲得足够彌補的分數。總之，美國認爲他們在各方面有着太充沛的實力，不易爲其他任何國家所打倒。美國深信必操勝算，另外還有一個理由，那就是英·法·義各國的參加世運代表隊，都因爲受戰爭的影響，而實力大爲削减。蘇聯的是否參加，至今還懸爲疑問，所以就目前的局勢來估計，美國的遝動健兒，祗認爲瑞典還可能是美國的一個勁敵。</p>
<p>業餘體協運動大會</p>
<p>從參加美國業餘體育協會六十週年運動會的美國運動家的成績，我們可以對美國參加世運代表隊的實力略穫端倪。在上述的遝動會中，美國第一流的田徑健將打破了三項，平等了兩項美國田徑賽的紀錄，成績最好的一項是洛杉磯體育會薛穆所創標槍紀錄，成績一百四十八英呎，比芬蘭代表所保持的世界紀錄祗差十英呎。另外兩項破紀錄的，一項是二千九百米的混合接力，成績是七分四秒三，另一項是四百米接力，成績四十秒九。（獲勝者都是聖安東尼體育會）兩項平美國全國紀錄的，一是狄拉德的二百米低欄，成績二十三秒三，另一是洛杉磯體育會的一千六百米接力，成績是三分十五秒。美國體育界人士記爲美國參加世運代表隊的弱點是長跑，他們認爲美國在從半英里一直到馬拉松的長距離徑賽中，將毫無得分的希望。據揣測，瑞典的長跑家將在從半英里起的長跑節目中，佔絕對的優勢，歐洲其他國家可能也凑趣帮點忙，美國體育界人士知道瑞典擁有優秀的能以三分四十八秒創造一千五百米紀錄的長跑家，而同這可驚的成績，相差在二秒以內的長跑家，瑞典還有六名之多。</p>
<p>其億國家選手實力</p>
<p>關於其他國家的優秀選手，據美國調查：荷蘭有一位叫期立克休斯的，一千五百米的成績是三分五十秒四，法國有位漢寳納的他一千五百米成續是三分四十八秒五。在五千米方面，瑞典的三位長跑家，英國的伍德生，芬蘭的漢羅，捷克的查託柏克，都有着平世界紀錄的成績。萬米方面芬蘭的漢羅，以及瑞典的五位長跑家，佔有控制性的優勢。馬拉松方面瑞典擁有不少健將。另外芬蘭赫湯南，朝鮮的徐永福，都有奪標的希望。美國業餘體育協會當局，對美國女子代表隊是否能獲得明年世遝的田徑賽冠軍一點，不敢抱很大的希望，最近在聖安東尼舉行的美國女子業餘高級和初級運動會裏，能造成任何接近美國紀錄的女選手，連一個都沒有。美國業餘體育會的秘書費利斯說：「美國女子對徑賽的興趣，大大减低了，我們缺乏粗大肥碩的女孩子，別國都有的」。不管有着上述的種種困難和勁敵，美國希望在短跑和着重技巧的節目方面，多多獲分、以便在世運會裏榮登冠軍的寳座。</p>
<h3>中青排球主力戰　華嚴敗於蘇聯　補賽完畢兩隊重決冠軍</h3>
<p>中靑排球購賽，昨晚甲觀主力；蘇聯隊綴復一　之仇，苦戰五局，卒將　叢擊敗，現兩隊戰績相等，將待補賽完畢，再行震決冠軍·昨共男女三塲，　塲女組，進德白對復華，雙方戰來頗見緊張，結果復華以二對一克進德白，次幕乙中部華　乙　志隊，華嚴乙始終佔據上風，建勝二爲吿捷。</p>
<p>壓軸甲粗大戰，關係錦標，華嚴師出以還，未嘗敗北，育循中曾以三比二力挫蘇聯，昨賽再勝，錦標即入囊中，蘇聯則亦祗此一敗，　標希望尙朱全絕，昨晚與華嚴再逢，冤家狹路。七時正，兩雄登塲，華嚴首局戰來頗見順利，以廿一比十八佔先，蘇聯眼見形勢不佳，故於二三局中猛烈搏殺，果見轉機，廿一比十，廿一比十八，連扳二局超前，第四局華豈甘落後、拚命關殺，功效立見，廿一比九，輕輕扳成各二平等，末局雙方生死關頭，戰况白熱，華嚴疲於應付，兵力漸呈不支，逐步落後，結果蘇聯以廿一比十七吿勝，三比二報復前仇，雙方成績相等，俟華嚴與永紗紅補賽完畢後，華嚴獲勝，則再重決，永紗吿捷，則錦標即落番軍掌握。昨賽各塲結果如下：</p>
<p>（一）復華勝進德白（女子）廿一－十二，十八－廿一，廿一－十一。（二）華嚴乙勝志隊（乙中）廿一－十一，廿一－十二。（三）蘇聯勝華業嚴（甲組）十八－廿一，廿一－十，廿一－十八，九－廿一，廿一－十七。</p>

<h3>各工業同業公會力爭　原料限額分配權</h3>
<p>定下週三派代表晋京請願</p>
<p>〔本報訊）輸入限額原料分配審議委員會，昨日下午四時在市商會開個，　田和　，潘士浩，汪竹一，顧　秋等各工業同業公會代表五十餘人，通過提案：</p>
<p>（甲）緊急辦法（一）請輸管會將第一期配額分給何家及配額若干公佈。（二）各工業同業公會未爭得配額者，各派代表向輸入管理委員會交涉。（三）各工業同業公會除用公文詳述理由，向輸管會要求配額外，並在各報宣傳工業原料應直接分配工廠應有之必要性。</p>
<p>（乙）應繼續派員赴京推動（一）硬性規定工商兩業限額原料之分配比例額。（二）明令工業協會，市商會共同組織審議會，審議工商兩業輸入配額，並令輸管會在未經審議前，不准任　公會申請。（三）取締進口商操縱居奇，拒絕訂約。（四）准各工廠在配額原料不數三月之用者，得自由辦理外匯，向國外訂購原料。（五）在短期內設立專營機構，以供應各工業原料之需？</p>
<p>（丙）治本辦法（一）請政府爲維護工業計，几工廠需要原料，直接向國外輸八，向輸管會申請發給進口證外，應予特別迅速及便利。（二）各工廠需要原料，應請政府直接予以配額，然後得向進口商訂購。進口商除得合法利潤外，不得有額外苛求條件，否則應准各工廠直接向海外訂購原料。（三）查政府以官價外匯訂購工業原料，應直接供應製造工廠，以免中飽而不致浪費爲原則。販賣商有藉口以供應上海市以外各工廠爲由，要求配額，殊與原則不合，應請政府交工業協會各地分會辦理。（四）進口商藉口取進口原料亦係配售工廠，然進“商是否能將進口原料均勻供應各業工廠，且不加利潤外之各種條件，故應請政府將進口各原料仍交各工業公會統籌分配。並指定合法代表查核進口商所進口之原料價格，有無超出合法價格。</p>
<p>會間並決定由各工業同業公會推派代表一人至二人於下週三（六日）乘十一時夜車赴京請願，並於七日下午招待南京新聞記者後，當日下午三時三刻返滬。　〔又訊〕各工業同業公會代表對國務院通過之封日貿易「局部」開放，表示（一）請政府解釋「局部」開放，確定其範圍。（二）在劃定之範圍內，對我國工商業有利者贊成、有害者則堅決反對到底。</p>
<h3>多方大量供售　華股臨收轉疲</h3>
<p>股昨永紗極多掙扎，紗花帮買　奇殷，但以廣帮及紗廠帮之實貨籌碼，依然大量流出，高價不能持久，臨收終於下挫，反以疲態結束。次熱及雜股除新光有助買因素，獨見堅定，永公交易有限，亦吿上漲外，形勢仍感鬆濫，前途尙難樂觀。</p>
<p>晨開時報載中日貿易勢必開放，生活指數增高並無多大影響，反承前收之餘勢，開出均昂。遞永紗開高至二三五元後，三二號二三二號了結，退落少許。二二三號一五四號一五七號一九七號再進，後漲高到二三一六元。一〇八號一四二號一四三號一六〇號供給，退至二三〇元。九七號一〇四號七六號尙進，拉上少許，終因一四三號一〇三號二一九號二三號八號二二四號俱售，逐漸號低至二二八元。延至十時四十分後，二三一號一五四號一九六號六五號二二三號一五三號一二號一七一號來進，一九〇號亦進現永紗，又復逐漸回升至二三八元。二一八號廣帮猛力脫手現永紗，一一七號一七二號一四三號一五七號亦來賣出，逐漸盤低至二三〇元光景。十一時三刻後，一三四號一二號一一二號一四八號力售，一五七號一二六號一七二號八號一五二號二三二號亦賣，臨收時現永紗退至二二四元收市。遞永紗降至二二六元，而後以二二八元結束。餘股僅永公尙見堅定，新光俏後稍回，尙呈穩健。景福華豐則未見樂觀，收後遞永紗由七三號七六號供給而喊低少許。結果較前收即交股計永紗信和美亞華豐景福勤興微挫，新光新華微升，永公成交寥落，軋升半成弱。中法國貨尙平，商務榮豐跌半成，責安中紡大通微升，景綸統益內衣微挫，火柴漲半成，中絲亦升半成弱。遞交股計新光獨吿微漲，永紗信和美亞華豐景福微挫。塲外各老股除中興外，仍見平疲。</p>
<h3>統債活躍　外股平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨得戰前存款，法院判決仍令千倍償還之訊，人心興奮。統丙晨開一〇三〇〇元，自一〇二〇〇元，陸續扳高至一一四〇〇元，而後微挫至一一〇〇〇元之關邊結束。五五二室五五五室五〇三室買進，二三〇室三六〇室則出，結果較前攻漲起一千元，餘者各漲五百元至八百元不等，成交五百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨怡紗英縣鍋業得對日和約簽訂，賠款有望之助而見秀。餘者不過平疲，證劵帮錢兌業有售，洋商及國華銀行則進。怡紗自八萬三升至八萬六收市。橡皮股已見平定，結果較前收計紙業怕啤航業均平，會德豐業廣機降，怡紗英聯鋼業均吿微漲。</p>
<h3>人絲上落狹隘　廠經綢貨平穩</h3>
<p>人造絲因配售尙無確期，以致行情堅穩，昨市一二〇號高山有光上午開盤價爲二千四百七八十萬元，最大到九十萬元，盤旋上落，相差只有十萬至二十萬元。下午最後價爲四百八十萬元，一五〇號有光去路較滯，售價亦短，昨金三馬牌成交價爲二千四百萬元。</p>
<p>廠經市况平穩，因成本關係，持貨者不肯廉售。昨市C字等級，藍福華喊價二千九百萬元，E字等級二千八百五十萬元，均有少數成交，不過貨款俱有五天至七天期頭。廿八分干經另担，一千七百萬元亦有成交。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市穩定，大誠被面收市二千〇四十萬元即期價，隔日期加二萬元。華强被面收市價與上日相同，格子　縐交易淸淡，喊價三萬三千九百元，三千六七百元有人要。冲實力紡產　　價稍大，申市昨做廿八萬元，正號廿九萬至三十萬元。其餘各貨。市價均無異動。</p>
<h3>現棉交易沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况沉寂，成交極少，趨勢甚疲。執貨者不易脫手，紗廠因棉紗去銷呆化，吸胃薄弱，同業均多有出無進，疲勞似非短期內可能振作，故交易無從　關。午後白洛去做開棧交價二〇六萬·　寳二一〇萬，火機一七二萬。</p>
<p>棉布略升</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，晨開依然　疲，　頭細布曾小至四十二萬一千元，旋以北帮對五福細布略予添辦，本街同業息低亦來拖吸，兼以日昨紡建公司，供售布疋，因申購不多，致市上籌碼枯竭，行情遂見　俏。最後十二磅龍頭細布撃高至四十三萬二千五百元，比上日回漲七千五百元。五福藍　彩球陽鶴等細布亦均回升二三千至穴七千元，其餘白坯布市亦見秀利，士林布一九〇　鷄及桃花女現貨頗多，下挫一萬元，色布藍布市呈穩定。　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司，昨日循例代紡會聯合配紗，共配六七七件，全部配予廠商，申購單共二五九張。</p>
<h3>食米交易稀少　粳幣續見下挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧二千八百餘石，市勢以內地回跌，人心虛軟，市塲交易稀寥，粳秈米冉冉下挫，步跌萬元。惟白元陰元則貨稀仍堅，浦東新粳續到十餘石，分高次二種，價格不動。湘米正在運輸之中，漢口將有大批東下，贛皖亦有來申，川米不絕於途，秈米形勢暫少樂觀。</p>
<p>麵粉納戶仍在看小之中，惟廠方因原料堅昂，成本關係，不肯輕易脫售，一時難於過跌。廠粉雜牌粉統粉均見微挫千餘元，而洋粉去化香燥，挺升三四千元。麩皮不脫疲境，再短千元。豆餅消化頗呆，挫跌三四千元。營口餅在瀉七八千元，尙少受主。黃豆節節挫退，步削三五千元。茶豆仍居提高殺次之局，赤豆站平。生仁洋莊不動，步步下降，續跌萬元。芝蔴穩固之象，紅糧存到兩少，酒坊動辦，猛漲萬元。苞米酒精廠暢納，北洋問津漸趨高翔，繼續暴漲萬元。蠶豆客帮略進，本街亦有納胃，浙方續動，再加二三千元。</p>
<p>油市波動甚少，生油初疲後堅，豆油先堅後回，無所榮辱，淸油暫平，菜油盤旋之格，惟蔴油貨多，見疲萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕大英公司得利維拉號輪，前日駛英，裝有豆油八百四十五噸運往荷蘭，猪鬃二十六噸，茶葉六嘲運倫敦。</p>
<h3>食糖趨勢平疲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平疲，間有小跌，而成交依然不旺，暫無上展之象。公會劃盤，二〇中砂白五十五萬五千元，小五千元。台赤仍爲五十六萬元。四半白六十六萬元，汕揭陽靑四十一萬七千元，興化白袋裝高貨六十一萬元，次之五十八萬元。興赤四十三萬元，次之四十萬〇五千元，共成交三百件弱。</p>
<h3>輸主管會今討論　收購新茶價格</h3>
<p>政府當局爲謀發展茶葉外銷，在推廣會督導之下，由中央信託局負責收購。茲悉輸廣會定今日舉行執委會議，討論本年新茶收購價格等問題，決定後即由中信局開始收購。</p>
<p>據悉：本年各地新茶，茶商採購來滬者，約六萬担左右，大部出中農銀行承做押款。迄昨日爲止，該行新茶押款總額爲三百億，均將由政府收購後輸出外銷。至去年押款陳茶，目前僅祁門茶，因到期而由中信局收購，其餘則因收價問題尙有爭議。故至今懸而未決。</p>
<p>茶市活潑　各　內銷茶自本街店莊及客帮各路　績吸取以來，昨日市上去化遂仍活潑，且其中猶以低檔紅茶，無錫一帶注視頻緊，致過程更若得水之魚，做開價格，則均盤旋　境。默察前途尤有迭向前進之望，至於洋莊茶市，進出依然雨寂，趨勢　續平靜。</p>

<h3>雪克斯丁沒落</h3>
<p>雪克斯丁係炎暑期中最形旺銷之貨品，當初呢　　西服二帮供有配備，今夏則　無賣買。蓋賣方旣未向美定到，買方亦無需要·致本廠貨亦未見新出品。目下一般人多改穿簾膠布香港衫，以致造成雪克斯丁到銷寂　，行見落伍淘汰。</p>
<p>金山枝轉鬆　金山枝因近日續有運到，而去化較呆，價乃再度轉愚，昨市又降十萬元，產價或將　降。</p>
<p>百合干時有運到，遂成供過於求之象，開價亦一再下游，現市已進八十萬關，比最高價步小三分之一，行歲爲八十萬元，亦僅薄利，貨主未免吃虧。</p>

<h3>青島觀象台台長對本報記者暢談　謎樣的飛碟</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員邵愼之青島航訊〕靑島觀象台台長王華文光生，以科學觀點，說破「飛碟」之謎，所謂科學方法，即是重證據，重分析，所以王先生說：到處發現的所謂「飛碟」，無論如何，有「探空氣球」被誤認在內，沒有肯定完全是汽球之誤。因爲截至目前爲止，實在還沒有完全取得眞正所謂飛碟的確切證據。</p>
<p>比事一傳十，十傳百，迭經報紙登載，遂轟傳世界。也如同所謂「曾子殺人」的故事，即是不信也得相信了，而事實上却全無此事，完全是汽球的誤認，我以爲實在是太可能的。</p>
<p>就記者所知，無綫電探空氣球，原係德人所首先設計成功者，內裝氣壓計，溫度表，濕度表，各有引綫，當三表變化時，即由引贛分引其所附的可　　電器，使內裝的無綫電所發出的振盪局率發生變化，而由地面特製的接收機收得。並不是一般的所謂發報機。大約每隔三分鐘或五分鐘輪流發出一次，其原理至簡單，構造亦甚易。報載成都某教授謂係由飛機所投下者，則似有誤，這是由地面放到高空去的。</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，日本爲須探知重慶氣候，以便飛機轟炸，常遣偵察機在渝上空放出此項儀　，仍懸氣球，因爲日本人不能在重慶地面放的緣故。所以用飛機。曾有爲我檢獲者，軍令部方面派人研究，當時一般說來，對氣象還不大注意。（甚至戰事之初，仍作氣象預報），對這個內裝「小電燈泡」的盒子經研究出爲測報氣象的無綫電。我們曾經想仿造，什麼都容易，就是小如指頭的眞空管也不難，似電池却大成問題，小如兩們麻雀牌的乾電池，要發出四十五伏脫的電却不容易，這是中國工業技術問題。</p>
<p>現在中國各地所發現的，大抵是美國人所放，中美氣象是合作的，中美合作社在抗戰工作中包括這一部份工作。這種盒子，放一個大約現價芙金十元至廿元，中國的氣象台是放不在的。爲不放則已，要放則必須每日放，才能得紀錄。如上海成都，則我可深信是美軍所放出的。他們經常做此項工作。而別的地方大抵則如王華文先生所說的僅是氣球了。所以飛碟實在是常見的，只是平時不大被人注意而已。</p>

<h3>飛碟　神秘怪物歟？探空汽球歟？</h3>
<p>〔本報靑島訊〕靑島觀象台台長王華文先生，應記者之請，特揮汗撰成一稿，詳論飛碟與探空汽球之形態，茲錄原文如次：</p>
<p>近日來太平洋東西兩岸中美人民，先後均曾發現空中怪物－飛碟或飛盤，因其事屬罕見，且在原子彈成力使人驚魂甫定，美蘇關係微妙，劍拔弩張之時，此項怪物盛傳於美國上空，很容易引起人把牠與原子彈的關係拉在一起，忽略其科學上之探索而着眼於軍事上之後果。同時我國北塔山事件爆發以後，蘇機協助蒙軍入侵，羣情激昂，中蘇「友好條約，正在國人心中重新估價時期，我國境內南自港粵，北及瀋陽，西至西安，東達靑島，亦先後發現飛碟凌空，更足以引起一般人之猜測與不安。根據近日各方對於飛碟之新聞報導，言人人殊，旣無實際資料，足資研討，自不敢妄加評定，斷其虛實。惟自個別新聞消息中，可以想像到若干發現者所敍述之觀察事物，固可認爲是不可想像之神秘怪物－飛碟或飛盤，但其中亦不無一部份很可能爲氣象台施放之探空汽球，而爲人誤認。探空汽球在氣象方面應用，雖已普遍，但國人對其認識，似嫌不足，茲特將探空汽球之一般現象稍加說明，庶此後空中再有類似之神秘物發現時，亦可增强觀察者之鑑別能力。</p>
<p>高空測候方法甚多，有飛機風箏汽球等等方式，就中汽球一項，又有乘人汽球，繫留汽球，測候汽球，測雲汽球，測風汽球及無綫電探空汽球等多種，吾人統名之探空汽球，在此數種探空汽球中，乘人汽球與　留汽球，現時幾盡廢置不用，且其或有觀測人負隨之上升，或有繩索牽之於固定高度，浮游太空，固定少動，不易與飛碟或飛盤發生誤會。其可以引起誤會者，當以其餘各種探空汽球可能性最大；其中測候汽球與無綫電探空汽球體積甚大，在地面時之直徑約有二三公尺，其下分別撃有測量高空溫度濕度及氣壓之儀器，上升高度可及一萬七千公尺以上之同溫層，高度愈增，空氣愈稀，大氣壓力减低，汽球體積加大；最後汽球破裂，即行墮落，因英在空中隨風漂蕩，路徑至不一致，水平方向運動之快慢，視高空風速大小以爲斷。測候汽球於汽球破裂後，所携儀器墮地，檢算儀器中溫濕壓三者之自記曲綫，以爲高空之探測紀錄，但測候汽球往往落於距施放地數白里之外，且不免有時落於湖海荒野之中，不易檢得，故以後多用無綫電探空汽球代替之，該儀球下携帶特製之溫濕壓氣象儀器，可自助將高空上述三氣象要紫，山無綫電信號發出，地面直接收聽或繪成圖綫，旣穩安，又迅速；故現時多以無綫電探空汽球代蓄測候汽球。至測震與測風汽球，前者探測雲底高度，後者測量高空風信（風向與風速），球積較小，在地面時之直徑約一公尺許，上升後藉這　儀觀測其方位；測雲汽球旨在探測雲層高度，故於有雲天氣施放之，地面上可見之高度悉依雲底高度爲限，多不甚高。測風汽球在這緯儀中可觀測至一萬公尺以上高度，晴朋天氣，肉眼仔細觀察，雖高至七八千公尺，亦可見之。測候汽球測雲汽球測風汽球及無綫電探空汽球，雖大小與上升高度稍有不同，但其亦有若干共同點，可歸納述之：</p>
<p>（一）色澤：紅，黑，白及銀灰色四種顏色最多，視天空背景顏色如何，決定使用之。（二）形狀：多作球形，惟有時因球皮厚薄不勻，盛滿氫氣後，以各方壓力不等，亦有成橢球形者，在地面仰視之，僅見其割面，遂成圓形或橢圓形。（三）速率：上升速度每分鐘約自一百公尺至三百公尺，視需要情形，可由球皮重量與盛貯氫氣多寡計算之，水平速度悉依上空風力大小爲定。（四）方向：汽球方向以高空風向爲依歸，因上空風向多變，故汽球進行方向，不僅不一定與地面風向一致，即在上空各高度層，亦不定相同。　以上四種爲</p>
<p>探空汽球　之通性，以下再這飛碟或飛盤若何？惟對於飛碟或一飛盤並無人直接得之，詳加研究，至多也不過新聞中獲得些許槪念而已。頃就所得新聞資料而觀，則所謂飛碟者，乃：</p>
<p>（一）色澤：作白色或銀灰色。（二）形狀：成圓形，直徑自四五公尺至二十五英尺不等。（三）速率：緩慢者有徐徐上升，快速者有急如流星。（四）方向：自東北向西南，亦有向東南飛去者。</p>
<p>以上四點，自不能斷爲飛碟或飛盤之通性，况根據一次之記載，更不能認定方向均爲自東北而西南，或逕去東南，且速率變差過鉅·其有急如流星者·當可認定絕非探空汽球所能及，然就徐徐上升之一種而言，雖其色澤，形狀，速率，方向四者皆與探空汽球相同，亦不能確定其合於上述</p>
<p>四種通性者，則爲探空汽球，正如「馬爲四足獸，而四足獸不一定均爲馬」之同樣道理；只因有人獲得此種飛碟，眞憑實據，證明其爲氣象探穴儀器。</p>
<p>前此發現之飛碟或飛盤，雖可能爲一種新興神秘之物，但最低限度其中至少有一部份爲氣象台施放之探空汽球，而爲人誤認。只因國際風雲緊急，人們精神上的不安，很容易導引慧眼人向太空去發現奇蹟，故當飛盤或飛碟消息甚囂塵上以後，愛因斯坦教授表示「絕無意見發表」之時，美國空軍則僕僕長空，晝夜搜索，其爲科學上探本求源之精神，固令人欽敬；但其致力於軍事上效果之探討，實遠較其科學研究之興趣　　，則可斷言。</p>
<p>目前飛碟誠飛盤之爲何物，　尙不能判定，但其有一部份可能爲探空汽球之混，不爲無因。即如靑島十八日魯東通訊社消息「本市上空（十八日）晨九時四十二分鐘發現類似飛碟之物，惟無法提出較有力證據，證明其爲飛碟。發現時在二千尺高空，方向爲西北方，時而昇高，時而降低，該物</p>
<p>圓而有光，由西北向東南方飛予以，約五六分鐘後，即愈升高，飛馳而逝。記者當時在塲，一般圍觀者（約二十餘人）議論紛紛，皆不悉是何物云」。笨者當時雖未目睹該項類似飛碟之物，但經檢視當日靑島觀象台之探空汽球紀錄，　台當日上午九時曾　放汽球一次，該項汽球作乳白色，上升　萬每分煙約一百八十公尺，是日二千至三千公尺高空爲四北風，風速甚小，每小時約七八公里，汽球當隨風向自西北飛向東南。故當“靑島市民發現之飛碟，無論在時間高度形狀或飛行方向各方面言，似均與觀象台嘗日施放之汽球，不無關聯。惟吾人自不能憑此斷定其必屬汽球而非「飛碟」。本文僅將汽球與所謂飛碟或飛盤可以　跡之處，提供如上。至飛碟或飛盤究爲何物？有待繼續之觀察與獲得分析後，始能鑑定。當茲國際局勢刀光劍影撲朔迷離之秋，飛碟頻出，實予人以相當警惕，惶怵不安，然愼辦明察，亦正需吾人於鎮靜中求之。（七，下七）</p>

<h3>滕縣喋血七畫夜</h3>
<p>滕，小國也，春秋戰國時代，外交上事齊乎？事楚乎？生存在兩大之間的夾縫裏，仰人鼻息，伺人顏色，委實不是一件容易的事。但是誰也料不到二千五六百年後的今天，滕縣會在抗戰戡亂的軍事上，成爲了敵我必爭的要地。廿七年之春，日軍坂垣征四郎，和磯谷廉介，南北夾擊徐州，我們廿四軍鄧錫侯部的王銘章師長，血灑孤城，戰死滕縣，爲抗戰殉了國</p>
<p>今年七月十二日，共軍華東野戰軍，在陳毅葉劍英的統率下，竄犯滕縣，復經我整廿四軍李玉堂的廿師楊幹才師長，鏖戰七日，予以迎頭痛擊。前者成仁，後者成功，同是廿四軍，在抗戰的戡亂的過程中，留下了光輝的紀載。</p>
<p>滕縣在津浦路正面，當南梁江南岸，西隔微山湖，與豐沛相望，共軍爲了實現「打下滕縣城，迎接即將到來的大反攻」計劃，一路由葉劍英第三，第八，第十等縱隊，由新泰，萊蕪間，沿汝河，汶水以北公路，兩路夾擊泰安後，西指肥城，平陰；一路由劉伯誠率領第一·第二·第三·第六·第七等縱隊，由豫北渡河，企圖囊刮魯西，東犯濟寗；一路由陳毅親統主力第一·第二·第四·第五·第七等縱隊，窺伺費縣，進出嶧縣，棗莊，妄想擴大孟良崮包圍整七十四師張靈圃的作戰計劃，迫我徐兗綏靖區李玉堂司令官的部隊，於內綫作戰而殲滅之。滕縣當戰事未展開前，原係我徐兗綏靖區司令部的所在地，戰起以後，整廿師始負起了保衛滕縣的責任。</p>
<p>滕縣守將整廿師楊幹才師長，原是「民元革命，九五抗英」的廿軍川軍老幹部，廿軍最初的領導人是現任貴州省政府主席楊子惠（森）將軍，抗戰期間，應援淞滬，戍守安慶，轉戰湘鄂阻敵黔桂。第一次長沙會戰後，楊森調升第廿七集團軍總司令，楊繼超（漢域）繼任軍長，卅四年春，楊繼超與現任靑島警備司令丁治磐先後升任第廿七集團副總司令，楊幹才遂由一三四師師長，廿軍副軍長，而升任軍長。日寇投降，奉命接收桂柳，警備長沙，去冬整編爲整廿師後，始調駐魯南。楊師長長長的臉，高高的顴骨，身材亦相當　長，說一口純粹的四川話，能書善後，寫得一手好金剛經，酒量亦很宏大。論起輩份來，他是楊漢域，副總司令的族侄，楊森主席的侄孫，是「楊家將」中傑出的靑年將領。</p>
<p>此次滕縣之職，楊師長幹才的整廿師，僅轄一三三·一三四兩個旅之寡，拒共軍四五萬之衆，喋血七晝夜，斃傷共軍近兩萬，造成了媲美七十一軍陳明仁將軍堅守四平的大捷。本來廿師部隊的士兵，巴蜀健兒居多，一向利於在山岳地帶打運動戰·此次更能發揮「守必固」的精神，打陣地戰堅守滕縣，粉碎了共軍切斷徐兗，包圍徐州，攻佔濟南的美夢，使林彪不得志於東北者，陳毅依然受挫於魯南。最近共軍雖有死灰復燃，捲土重來，再犯滕縣的打算，但相信憑藉徐兗綏靖區司令官兼廿四軍軍長李玉堂將軍，過去長沙第三次大捷，副軍長方先覺堅守衡陽四十七天的指揮經騐。益以楊師長幹才所部十盪十決的作戰精神，共軍飛蛾撲火，無異自取滅亡。（朱振聲，七·卅）</p>

<h3>談血壓過高症　及其新療法</h3>
<p>— 梁俊青</p>
<p>我們醫師對於血壓過高的病症有時眞正覺得沒有辦法。爲什麼呢？因爲目前的各種療法往往只是「比較性的」而不是「絕對性的」，我們用了這種方法或許可以把這個血壓過高的病者醫好了，但是其他的血壓過高症患者用之却是絕對無效。反之，我們用了其他的治療方法把某種血壓過高症醫好了，然而又不能適用於這一種血壓過高症。諸如此類不一而足，總之，血壓過高症的療法在目前還不過是「比較性」的而不是「絕對性」的。而且我們還有一種經騐，假如把過高的血壓弄低下來時往往還會使病人更加不舒服，頭暈，疲乏，心悶，非等到他的血壓回復到原來的高度不止。上海有許多成名的老醫師，他他的血壓也很高，也曾想過許多方法去醫治它，但是結果惟有任其自然而已。</p>
<p>當然，我們也曉得，血壓過高的原因有許多，譬如用腦過度的人可以得血壓過高，勞力過甚的人也可以得血壓過高症，又如患腎臟萎縮症的人也可以得血壓過高症，此外如遺傳性的血壓過高症，梅毒性，鉛中毒性，烟酒的慢性中毒性以及糖尿病，肥胖症等都可以有血壓過高現象。我們的療法當然也跟着病原的不一而有所異同。但是，不管它的原因如何，而想法子求其血壓减低的「目的」則究全相同。而且，遇着血壓由增高而减低下來的種種煩惱（例如頭暈，心悶，全身疲乏，脫力等），照樣也够使我們勞心哩。（舉一個例。有一位醫師吿訴我：「一個病人因患高血壓症來院就診，日久不退，亦無任何不良之附帶症象。某日病者忽訴不適，頭暈，疲乏，四肢無力，臉色蒼白。某醫以爲血過高所致乃以血壓表測騐之，則僅有一百度左右，再三測騐，均屬正確無誤。某醫大詫，窮詰之，方知其私自吞服少許明礬（按此爲土方之一種）所致。遂禁止其繼續吞服明礬，並以他法治之，惟病者體力始終未能康復，甚至不治云）。</p>
<p>的確，有許多高血壓症的患者在他們經過了種種的治療方法而結果毫無效果之後便爾採取了一種放任主義，飲酒者照常飲酒，食烟者仍舊食烟，且樂得過了一天算一天，至於血壓過高之後會有什麼可怕的結果，那當然也不去想它了。</p>
<p>當然，有許多的親戚朋友們一定會在旁邊替這位病者着急的，恐怕它會發生了血管破製的險症。可是，眞正奇怪，他倒不見得會因此中風。多少年以來，他就血壓過高了，然而他到現在還很康健活潑地活着呢。這眞一個不可解答的謎兒！</p>
<p>近幾年來，醫藥界在維也命的研究方面的確獲有偉大的成績。因爲不在本篇範圍以內所以暫時只好從略。不過，他們那般藥物專家現在又從烟葉裏提煉出一種與維他命P有些相似的物質。它的名字叫做Rutin「露汀」。它是Quercetin的臘素。在醫麥的葉和花內可以大量地提煉出來。牠的功用是阻止血管的變脆（即使血管不易破裂）而促使血管的彈靱性回復正常。（見Dr．Couch，Dr．Griffith，Dr．Lindauer三氏一九四四年之醫學生物實騐報吿）。Proc．Soc．Exptl．Biol．Med．55，228(1944）。</p>
<p>根據了這種報吿，他們（如Shanno，Bridel&amp;Beguin等人）更加在這一方面斷續地有所發現與進步。因爲篇幅關係，只好把它省略。不過我們大家已經可以曉得爲什麼脊許多血壓過高的人能够安然地繼續生存着而不致於中風死去。因爲血管的破裂與否（即中風與否）在外表上好像與血壓過高有關，其實是毫不相關的事情，譬如好的汽車胎吧！你把它打氣壓進了高至四十五度或至六十度的氣壓，它可以照常應用行駛，絲毫無碍。但是假使你用了一只已經發硬而脆的車胎呢，那末把它打氣到了三十度的氣壓，已經隨時可以破裂了。所以，血管的破裂與否，並不是血壓高低的問題而是血管的脆否，（易碎），的問題。簡言之，就是血管內有無缺乏露汀的問題。假如我們體內含有相常多的露汀那末血壓雖然高也是沒有危險的。</p>
<p>好！有恃無恐了了飲酒的人們和吸香烟的人們啊！你們從今後可以减少了這種顧忌了。</p>
<h3>診餘漫談（一）</h3>
<p>— 吳濟華</p>
<p>（一）用藥的經濟問題</p>
<p>國家貧困到如此地步，而人民依然奢侈浪費，不知刻苦自勵，想法打節約算盤，以保持國家元氣，言念之下眞堪痛心。自抗戰勝利以來，馬路上豪華的汽車一天多似一天，市塲上奢侈品消耗品，如名烟名酒高貴無綫電電冰箱等更是五光十色眩人耳目，這許多豪門巨賈的享受，固然耗費了巨額外匯；但是窮人的作風也未見示弱，男女飯後一枝烟，學生天天看電影，學跳舞，更有日夜又麻雀賭通宵的，尤其荒唐之至。社會的風氣這樣糜爛，當政的又沒有什麼疏導糾正的措置，人人只求今朝有酒今朝醉，那管明天無米炊，欲言戰後國家的建設與復興，誠不勝令人浩嘆。</p>
<p>以上是說同胞們浪費的大概情形，筆者狠引以爲憂的。廢話少說，言歸正傳，講到我們醫藥界用藥的情形，也有狠多浪費而極不經濟的狀態，有待於我們醫師與病人兩方面的通力合作，以節約我們的資力，以保持我們國家的元氣。現在先把幾種所謂名貴藥品的墨市價格列表於下，以作我們檢討的日標：</p>
<p>一，安樂根Eugon每盒四百五十萬元（十支裝）</p>
<p>二，保妥酊Padutin每盒一百六十萬元（五支裝）</p>
<p>，三度冷丁Dolautin每盒五十五萬元（五支裝）</p>
<p>四，奧拍泰純OPtarson每盒六十八萬元</p>
<p>五，託拿福賜芬Tonophosphan每盒一百四十萬元</p>
<p>六，先靈司保命Spesminchering每盒四十五萬元</p>
<p>七，保女榮針（德貨）每盒七十萬元（三一支裝）</p>
<p>八，濃保女榮針ProgynonBoleosum每盒二百四十萬元（五支裝）</p>
<p>九，蓋世維雄十公絲針Testoniron　10mg每盒一百萬元（四支裝）</p>
<p>十，蓋世維雄二十五公絲針Testoniron　25mg每盒二百二十萬元（四支裝）</p>
<p>十一，奧司的令鈣Calcirum　Ostelin　“Glaxo”每瓶四十萬元</p>
<p>十二，愛爾邦片Elbon每瓶四十三萬元（二十片）</p>
<p>十三，咳嗽露Cossonol　E．Merck每三瓶十二萬元（二百公撮）</p>
<p>十四，茛菪精鋁出倫BelladonnaNeutralon每盒四十六萬元</p>
<p>上列各藥雖有相當治療功效，但並不是救命特效華，也並不是沒有類似代替品的獨門藥，所以費如許高昂代價去覓實樣搜購他，簡直是失却理智浪費金錢，而造成了囤積藥商的發財機會。雖說物以希爲貴，但是藥物是治病的，她並不是古董，不應該以古董的眼光去搜求而抬它的身便。假定超過了它應得的身價，就被人們放棄而不去搜求，試問它能自己漲價嗎。你倘然自己到美國去觀察或者試問旅美的朋友，在彼邦有沒有人出驚人高價搜購德製或其他缺乏的藥品？他一定會吿訴你，這種愚蠢而揮霍的舉動在美國是絕無僅有的。所以我以爲在我國有許多不合情理被人恥笑的事件，都是因爲教育程度太淺，人民缺乏常識而受高等教育的人士又懶於教誨同胞且一部份同胞也夜郎自大不肯領教而造成的。即就現在所談的用藥浪費問題而論，我以爲衛生常局，醫師與病人三方面都應該負相當責任而藥商居奇抬價亦應被取締。待我先拿上列各渠一一給以評價幷討論如何代替後，再來說明三方面都應負責的理由。</p>
<h3>日光與健康（上）</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>「太陽，生命的源泉」，在詩人的筆下，文人的紙上，甚至騷客的口中，都在歌頌日光的偉大，聖潔，它不但給人類帶來了光明，而且也帶來了力量。</p>
<p>日光爲一切生物生命的根太，人類的生存，與它有密不可分的關係，假若沒有日光，世界上就沒有生物了。這樣與我們生活及生命有關係的東西，我們應該了解。</p>
<p>日光與人類及其健康的關係，可以分作幾點敍述：</p>
<p>第一，對於人體的物質代謝關係：人體的物質代謝，因日光的影響而增進，最主要的現象是呼吸，呼吸時若把由肺排出來的二氧化碳拿一定裝置計算，而測定其他物質代謝的度量，就曉得身體受日光照射後，呼吸增進特別顯著，並且物質代謝的產物，如尿，汗等也增加其數量。</p>
<p>第二，對於小兒體發育的關係：日光對於小兒體發育的關係更大，夏季兒童的發育，較好於冬季，所以我們看到熟帶地區的兒童較寒帶兒童顯著的發育快速，可認明日光能促進身體的發育成長，還有不會跑路的小孩子，有的是面色蒼白，就因爲常常放在屋內，缺乏日光的緣故，在工業多霧的地方，城市小兒易得佝僂病，皆由日光照射缺乏之故。</p>
<p>第三，對於一般人身體發育的關係：住在黑暗的地方，像地的低層，地窖，深谷等處的人，容易精神疲憊，形容枯稿。如常在日光下奔跑，就大不相同，因光綫爲能，照射人體，組織可以吸收光綫的能，而轉變成熱，故人體內一部份熱量由光綫得到，而爲身體工作動能，如造血，新陳代謝，多賴日光能所促成，最顯著者，如人體經日光照射以後，皮膚中所含的酪氨基酸(Tyrosine）氧化轉變成黑色素（Melanin），黑色素沉着於表皮與眞皮的中間，有保護身體的功用，因黑色素可以吸收紫外綫，而不使紫外綫進入深層，破壞組織的細胞，並可以吸收紫外綫，而轉變成熱，送入身體，刺戟各部組織機能，故皮膚黑爲「健康美」的表徵，但過度洒太陽，黑色素失去保護作用，皮膚亦會發炎的。</p>
<p>第四，對於病人或體弱者的關係：現今醫學醫療上，對於病人或體質虛弱的人，所引用的日光浴，就是應用日光，令牠的活力，深達內層的一種治療法，通常八行日光浴也有許多好處，如人體經過日光直射後，皮膚吸收紫外綫，可以製造維生素丁，因此，日光賦有抗軟骨病的作用，有許多國家，時常舉行夏季大露營，其最大的目的，就是多行日光浴啊里</p>
<p>第五，對於神經的關係：人們的神經系，也能感受光的刺戟，尤以眼睛能够媒介光的現象，而起特殊的心理反應，如住在赤色光綫的房中，精神就很快活，時時喜歡跑動，不願靜坐，又如在菜圃中散步，菜花像舖黃金似的，加以和暖的春光，益覺精神抖擻，快樂無極，又如久住在被綠色照射的房子中，就漸漸覺得不快樂，精神變鎭靜，運動被抑遏，又如室內舖了靑色毛氈，就覺得比實在面積要廣大些，並且覺得空虛而寒冷，這都是日光對神經系的影嚮實。</p>
<p>第六，關於殺滅微生物的關係：日光有一偉大作用，就是能殺滅微生物，如霍亂，傷寒等病原菌，遇日光直射數小時即死，就是病原菌中生活力最强的結核桿菌，如遇日光直射，不出數小時，也就死滅，現在已有證明，日光對於骨骸的結核和皮，腺或內腹部的結核病，均能治療，不過，肺結核病若引用日光治療，應受醫師的指導，否則，常是很危險的，又據學者們的實騐研究，在高山和沙漠的地方，日光殺菌時間，比較平原都市中，要快三四倍，就因爲那些地方的空氣稀薄，紫外綫多，並且乾燥而淸潔啊！</p>
<p>第七，對於土地的關係：吾人所居住的地方，要乾燥，不要潮濕，以免誘發疾病，因有日光的照射，能使土地乾燥，最合衛生。（待續）</p>
<h3>傷寒療法漫談（下）</h3>
<p>— 壽梧青</p>
<p>（六）腸出血療法</p>
<p>腸出血爲傷寒症中重要之併發病，臨診上見者不少。因腸壁潰爛，延及深層，侵入血管壁所致。視出血量之多少，對病人安全與否，有直接關係。出血療法，除外科手術及輸血以及止血注射針外，並內服止血片，安眠劑，鎭靜劑，同時鼓勵病人，勿稍慌張，臥床上停止飲食，停止動作，至少須四十八小時之久，除醫師特別囑咐外，每二小時給流質食物一二茶匙，以後逐漸增加。</p>
<p>（七）腸穿孔療法</p>
<p>傷寒高傷，腹部往往膨脹如鼓若非排氣（放屁）通暢，易有腸子穿孔之危險。穿孔之程度不一，一孔或數孔，大小不等，若體溫驟降，神色陡變，脈數，細，沉，微。氣如游絲，而有腹痛狀甚嚴重者，當疑爲本症之發生。極有生命之危險。細小之孔，亦有自然塡補痊愈者如無腸膜炎之發生，結果較佳。大多之孔，應酌量病情，施行外科縫補術，雖危險較大，較之不治死亡者差勝一籌。</p>
<p>總之，傷寒一症，千變萬化，隨機應付，惟在醫者之匠心。寥寥數十言，何能一窺全豹，惟精賅簡潔，却抵萬寳全書一隻角，舉一反三，還望讀者善自運用耳。</p>
<p>俊靑按：傷寒病之療法中，似應加入Sulfaguanidin一條，因筆者曾以此藥用於傷寒病者，結果甚爲有效。此藥雖爲治痢疾桿菌之特效藥，而其對於傷寒菌之殺菌作用亦甚大也。（完）</p>

<h3>挽救學生頹風</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>我們幷不是「復古論」者，一定要酸溜溜地提倡什麼形式上的「尊重師道」，要恢復到從前迂腐的師生之間那種「盲從」的關係。</p>
<p>我們以爲，現代的師生關係，應該更民主，更親切，更友誼地爲學術思想，互相合作，互相研討，互相論　。　種師生關係，才有助於學術科學的成長。</p>
<p>我們固然反對那種專制式書館式假面具的師生關係，可是我們對於當今學生對於師長之粗魯暴戾的氣槪，實在使人齒冷。</p>
<p>我們讀了淸華大學學生金承養爲貨幣銀行學考試不及格，竟用暴力對付教授趙守欣揮匕首刺傷趙教授的事，使我們十分憤慨。</p>
<p>這種粗暴的行動，我們應該認爲學術聖地的恥辱。</p>
<p>但養成一個優良的「學風」，也幷非一朝一夕之功。在那些「暴戾」「狂妄」的風氣裏，學生們何曾把學校當作學術的「聖地」？把老師何曾當作敬畏的師長？他們把學校不過看作「進身之階」的「跳板」。在這個情形下，老師「挨拳」「受辱」，也是當然的事了。</p>
<p>但是，學生們這一股一暴戾」之氣，必須使它改正過來，否則，這對於中國醫學術界，無異是一種侮辱，而對於整個學風，它將釀成無窮的禍害。</p>
<p>淸華學生的刀刺教授，這不是「因」，而是學生頒風造成的「後果」。</p>

<h3>盎山與緬甸獨立運動</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>緬甸方在爭取獨立由的途中，突於七月十九日暴發了政治暗殺的大流血案。從事緬甸獨立運動的唯一年靑領袖，現任緬甸臨時政府副總理的盎山，及其閣員巴文等七人，　不幸作了這次暗殺案的主角和犧牲者。這，自然是緬甸獨立運動過程中一種極不幸的突變。</p>
<p>昂山出生於一九一四年，今年纔僅三十二歲，他完全受了英國式的教育。（在緬甸教育出來的）一九三六年還是在仰光大學求學的時候，便熱心於政治活動，就在那年因積極組織學生罷課，而被學校當局開除。從此，他爽性潛心爲促進祖國的獨立運動而奮鬥，俾使緬甸提早脫離英國的統治。所以，他在政治上得勢得很快，而成爲近年來緬甸政治史上最有意魏的特出的人物。</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰初期，英國在西方失利而無暇東顧的時候，，他即已在緬甸嶄露頭角，在那個時期當中，他經常和印度的革命首領尼赫魯及國大黨的領袖們經常保持着接觸；同時，也促成他和日本人的接觸，因爲那時日本人便楊言將扶植遠東弱小民族的獨立。一九四二年日本侵入緬甸，從前那許多憎恨英國統洽的緬甸人，都表示願意和日本合作，日本亦佯予緬甸以獨立的名義。盎山那時自然站立在與日本合作的這一面，在日本卵翼下的緬甸政府作了部長，並建立了緬甸國民軍。可是與日本接觸漸久，他發覺日本的管制緬甸，仍然是個十足帝國主義者，全無扶助緬甸獨立的誠意，他醒覺過來，於是他利用職務的掩護，鼓勵反抗述動的擴大，使他成爲緬甸各黨派各階層聯合抵抗侵略的反法西斯人民自由聯盟的領導人，及緬甸國民軍的首領。一九四五年日本投降時，他所領導的國民軍和英印軍密切合作，深博得蒙巴頓勳爵的讚揚。</p>
<p>緬甸解放後，英政府發表允許給予緬甸自治領的地位，但沒有指出完成這種步驟的期限。他和反法西斯人民自由聯盟的領袖們認爲白皮書並沒有符合他們的政治願望，於是拒絕了和陶曼斯密士的臨時政府合作。到了一九四六年秋，證明了白皮書政策已完全失敗，乃由蘭斯爵士代替了陶曼斯密土取得盎山及其領導的聯盟合作，將緬甸的民族運動與重建工作打成一片。盎山即參加行政會議，任副總理兼國防與外交部長，聯盟也成爲行政會議中唯一的多數的黨。去年十一月的行政會議決議要求英國勢力迅速退出緬甸，經濟的和軍事的雙管齊下，强烈地表現了盎山的政治意願；同時他爲堅持中間政治路綫，於同一會議中將緬甸共產黨驅逐出聯盟。那時，他固然取得了英首相艾特里對緬甸獨立前途更深一層的了解，發出了容許緬人完全可以自由決定自己未來命運的諾言。可是另一方面却引起緬甸老政黨的嫉視，他們成立了國家民主聯合陣綫，跟他的聯盟站在對立的地位。這陣綫的領導者却正是現以暗殺案嫌疑犯被捕的前總理宇素。</p>
<p>因此，盎山被暗殺的內因，在英國觀察家認爲係極左派的反法西斯聯盟政見的根本衝突，和反對的嫉妬，這是極有可能性的。自然，盎山的死，是緬甸爭取獨立運動途中的一種極大損失，觀於他死的哀榮，也可以覘知緬甸人對他的崇敬和愛戴了。尤其，艾特里聲明英政府並不因暗殺事件而改變允許緬甸獨立的旣定政策，證明盎山的努力是沒有白費。</p>
<h3>日本間諜</h3>
<p>— 正明譯</p>
<p>日本間諜網的以前一個間諜人員，最近吿訴本文作者說，當初在中國淪陷區和東北內，日本共產黨的廣大網狀組織，曾經進行過搜集重要情報供給中共的活動，直到一九四二年才吿停止。</p>
<p>這個日本舊時間諜人員，曾在上每及東北住過多年，自戰爭結束以後，巳經寫過了好幾本非常著名的關於中國的著作。他於四月內已以日共黨員身份，被選進了日本參議院。</p>
<p>在一九四二年初，大多數的日共間諜人員，均被發現聞遭逮捕。所以從那時候起，替中共進行的種種間諜活動遂大爲减少了</p>
<p>這個間諜人員所屬的那個間諜團體，是大約三十個左右的南滿鐵路研究局內的日共黨員所組成的。這惆南滿鐵路研究局，共僱有職員大約一千人光景，在中國淪陷區各大城市內均駐有若干代表，搜集經濟資料。這三十個日共黨員，就在研究局內組成他們自己的組織，因爲可以利用該局差不多全部的研究工作，爲中共供給情報。</p>
<p>他本人就駐在上海，担任三個日本主要團體的顧問官，其間有一個就是一個秘密間諜諜國體，他將關於日本在華中的經濟政治和軍事計劃的各種有價値情報，設法轉給了新四軍。</p>
<p>後來因爲一次著名的間諜案件被破壞的間接結果，這個日共在中國的間諜團才被發覺。那次著名間諜案件中有一個人員，是一度做過首相近衛文曆的秘書，而且是日本駐納粹德國大使的秘書，他於一九四一年十月十五日被捕，當時日本秘密警察就發現他們都是受共產國際指導的間諜中心的首要人物。他們都在獄中被處決了。</p>
<p>大的在一百個被捕的人中間，就有二十個人被處決。還有五個人死於獄中：其餘在戰後均獲釋放。有二個人，包括他本人在內，因爲「逼供」和審訊時期一再延長，到一九四五年九月內始判處終身監禁，這時已在戰爭結束以後。所以幾天之後，他們均重獲自由了。</p>
<p>現在他和其他曾經胃過性命危險帮助中共軍隊的日共間諜人員們，均在從事寫作和發表關於中國的文章和那種危險性較少的行業了。（譯自Hucth　Deane原著）</p>

<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國的作家協會</p>
<p>美國各大城市都有與作家協會性質相同之組織，名稱祗管不同，業務僅大同小異，有些叫做Writers　Club，有些叫Seribblers　Club，有單純文藝性的，有帶點商業性的。單純文藝性的作家協會，每星期舉行茶話會或聚餐會一兩次，茶話會在會員家裏舉行，聚餐會在飯店舉行，經費由參加人公攤，當面付款結淸。在中國人看來相常小氣，因爲三四十個人的茶話會費，不過美金十餘元，要各人凑出三四毛錢，實則完全民主作風，大家都是主人。在茶話會或聚餐會時有幾個節目，諸如介紹新會員，來賓演說，宣讀論文詩歌之類，那些論文都是冗長乏味之作，好的作品早被書局搶去出版，等不到在作家協會宣讀的。詩歌是比較輕鬆的作品，頗有被音樂出版公司收買的。女作家們喜歡把自己得意的詩歌印在賀年片上分送親友，藉資自我宣傳，作家協會也介紹會員作品給小出版商印行，短篇小說介紹給當地報紙發表，稿費極爲有限，丹佛的一個女作家經由一家出版商出版了四種書，每種得到稿費三百元，以黑市匯率計算，合法幣一千二百多萬元，已足使中國作家昨舌，但三百元美金一部書，在美國實在是悽慘之至。美國出版界有一個大毛病，就是不燒冷竈，專捧己成名的作家，蓋美國人看書，不看內容，祗看著書人的名望，像林語堂先生和Emily-Hahn的作品會在美國不脛而走，就可十足表示美國讀書「崇拜英雄」感和一蜂窩了。著名的作家都不加入作家協會，而加入作家協會的都是作品毫無出路，想借作家協會的微薄勢力，推銷不成熟的作品，結果是作品送至作家協會，宛如石沉大海，過了一年半載，才在窮鄉僻壤的報紙上發表出來，眞使作家啼笑皆非。（三四）</p>

<h3>靈芝（下）</h3>
<p>— 賈祖璋</p>
<p>現在皇帝早已沒有，靈芝也不再被人作爲貢獻之物。但是歷史對於人類是一種重負，二千餘年以來關於靈芝那一種傳統的迷信，還是潛伏在人心的深處，蠢蠢思動。今年，尤其是靈芝重復交運的年份，二月間曾有人舉行過靈芝助學義展，現在又有了靈芝興學義展。但是，聽說那一次助學義展成績並不甚好，那原因不難推想而得，因爲靈芝本來是老百姓獻給皇帝的珍物，皇帝有權無條件向老百姓要求貢獻。推而廣之，一切有錢有勢的人，都有權向不如他的人盡量剝削。現在反其道而行之，要使有錢的人拔一二根毛下來挪助貧苦的學生，那不是與虎謀皮嗎？得不到好的成績，是勢所必然的，而且讀書是爲什麼？現在爲了讀會，而竟要恢復古代的迷信，也未免祗　目的，不擇手段了。</p>
<p>我們雖然知道總是恭維人家的好，但是「吾愛吾師，吾尤愛眞理」。揭露事實的眞相，减輕迷信的成分，究屬比一唯恭維尤爲要緊。靈芝的「靈」的時代已經過去，還牠一個本來面目罷。靈芝是屬於多孔　科的一種菌類，這一科的特徵：子實體膜質，革質，栓質或肉質，有柄或無柄。子囊層，生於子囊體下面的子囊層托腔的內面。托腔爲網狀結合的皺　或蜂窩狀的孔道，少數由輪狀的薄片所構成。一隻靈芝就是一個子實體。初生的時候細長如筆，後來下方成爲菌柄，上方開展爲扇形的菌蓋。像香覃，菌柄着生於圓形的菌蓋的中心，芝則着生於一側。菌蓋上面褐色或赤褐色，有同心的環紋；下面淡黃色或白色；菌柄柴色有光澤。質地堅硬，乾燥了可以長久保存。色彩可以有深淡的變化，以紫色爲最普通，所以稱牠爲紫芝，是名副其實的。紅芝也有過科學的記戰，黑芝大槪是指顏色特別深的；白芝和黃芝大槪因爲牠菌蓋下面的顏色特別顯著；青芝似乎是不可能有的、或者是近於黑色的吧！</p>
<p>舊時對於靈芝形態的記載，三國時代的魏襲有一篇神芝贊，倒是精細明確，合乎科學的精神：「靑龍元年（二三三年）神芝產於長平之習陽，其色丹紫，其質光耀，其長尺有八寸五分，其本圍三寸有三分，上別爲三榦，分爲九枝，散爲二十六莖，園則一寸九分。葉徑二寸七分。其榦洪織連屬，有似珊瑚之形。其吐柯載葉，祥明鐲潔，考圖案牒，蓋美乎所聞於前代者矣」。但這種芝的菌柄是分枝的，就是所調連理芝。這大槪是菌柄的偶然分歧，或數個靈芝同在一處生出，菌柄互相愈合而成。</p>
<p>除了菌柄分歧的變態以外，也有一柄而同生數個菌蓋的，如宋史所載：「咸平六年五月，導江縣民潘矩田生芝三層，黃紫色，高五寸許」。</p>
<p>靈芝寄生在梅，桃，樅，竹等樹的接近地面的部分，先是白色的菌絲，蔓延在樹皮下面，然後從菌絲上向外抽生子實體。古人沒有觀察引菌絲，所以說牠「無根而生」，認爲十分神奇。</p>
<p>現在走方郎中的地攤上，古董鋪子的廚窗裏，我們都可以看到靈芝·靈芝的用途，其實就限於這些了。</p>

<h3>Three Principles Decided by Our Country's State Council for Participating in Trade with Japan: Stipulation Not to Hinder Our National Economy</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The issue of opening trade with Japan was the subject of heated and thorough discussion at the State Council meeting on the 1st, and concrete conclusions were reached. First, Premier Zhang explained the proposal drafted by the Executive Yuan, and the commissioners spoke separately. It was generally agreed that our country, being a victorious nation, should not engage in mutual trade with Japan, a defeated nation. That is, we should not purchase Japanese goods, but only import Japanese reparations materials. Therefore, it cannot be called "opening up," but rather restoring private trade. After discussion, the original proposal was not agreed upon, and three principles were decided separately: (1) The government and the economic sector will jointly negotiate and form a private delegation to Japan for investigation. (2) The import and export of goods for trade with Japan shall be based on the principle of not harming China's national economy. (3) China's required materials for Japan should be extracted from the reparations materials as much as possible. Furthermore, the Allied Headquarters invited our private businesses to resume trade with Japan, while our country adopted a commercial control policy. Therefore, the current trade is under free trade conditions, taking control measures. The proposal was immediately passed, and the trade measures and organization will be drafted by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] After the State Council passed the conditional opening of trade with Japan in the morning of the 1st, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated: The ministry is prepared to execute all tasks required for the established national policy, including instructing the delegation stationed in Japan to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters for permission for the investigation delegation to enter the country, so that the delegation can arrive in Japan as scheduled and begin work.</p>
<p>[United Credit Reporting Agency, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] At the State Council meeting on the morning of the 1st, it was decided that trade with Japan would be restored soon. It is understood that our country is preparing to export tea, tung oil, bristles, camphor, sugar and a portion of surplus materials, hoping to obtain railway sleepers, machines, instruments, transportation tools, kiln wood, etc. from Japan. It is also planned that the value of materials exported to Japan will be twice that of imports. Furthermore, in order to protect our country's Nanyang market, the government authorities are planning to adopt a disguised subsidy method for goods sold to the region, in order to reduce costs.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Spokesperson Talks About the Establishment of the Trade Case: Delegation to Japan Negotiates and Organizes with the Economic Sector</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] This reporter recently inquired with the Executive Yuan about the establishment process of the trade case with Japan. The Executive Yuan spokesperson explained in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Since the case was raised by the Supervisory Committee, the Executive Yuan has held two meetings to discuss it. The first time, it was originally resolved to participate, but due to suggestions from the resident members of the National Political Council and opinions from groups such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the China National Industrial Association, it was raised again at the second meeting. Although a resolution to participate was made, it was still submitted to the State Council to merge the Executive Yuan's resolution with the National Political Council's proposal for discussion, which shows that the government's handling of this case is very cautious.</p>
<p>The reporter requested the spokesperson to explain the reasons for participation in detail, so that the public can understand the truth. The spokesperson continued: Our country's participation in trade with Japan did not begin after this case was decided. Last year, the Central Trust Bureau had already traded with Japan through barter trade. Comparing imports and exports to Japan last year and this year, they are generally balanced. The State Council's decision to organize a business delegation to Japan is just a slight expansion of the Central Trust Bureau's work on trade with Japan. This kind of business delegation, whose number and candidates are negotiated and organized by the Executive Yuan and the economic sector, can be said to be a kind of controlled trade, not completely free private trade. In addition, the misunderstanding of this matter by the general public is that the so-called opening of trade with Japan this time is the same as the usual opening of trade. In fact, this opening method only allows Allied delegations to be sent to Japan, and Japan cannot send business delegations or private individuals to China (or other Allied countries) for trade. Japanese businessmen who trade with Allied delegations must also be approved by the Allied Headquarters. Therefore, the so-called opening of trade with Japan this time has extremely strict restrictions.</p>
<p>The reporter further asked whether, after our country participates in trade with Japan in the future, Japan can use its consumer goods or other items that harm our national economy to seize our country's foreign exchange. According to the spokesperson's response, our country has various restrictions on foreign trade, especially on the import side, and there is an Import Management Committee to carry out management. The second item of the State Council's resolution more solemnly stipulates that the types and quantities of inputs and outputs in trade with Japan must be based on the standard of not harming China's national economy. Under this restriction, and with the business delegation being composed of members selected by the government, the dumping of Japanese goods in our country is absolutely impossible. As for foreign exchange, trade with Japan is the same as trade with other countries, and is still subject to the general method of foreign exchange management. These foreign exchange control measures are necessary measures to protect our country's industry and commerce. Moreover, the third item of the State Council's decision is that our country should obtain the materials it needs from the reparations materials as much as possible. At present, the reparations issue has not been fully agreed upon due to the relationship between national opinions. Therefore, there is no formal decision on the entire reparations issue with Japan. However, after the decision on the early dismantling method, our country can continue to negotiate to include Japan's future production as part of the reparations, hoping that our country can obtain as much of the materials it needs as possible from the reparations, so that our country can reduce a portion of the burden on the materials it needs from Japan.</p>
<p>The reporter also asked, some people advocate that trade with Japan must be after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, because when signing the peace treaty, reasonable restrictions can be made on Japan's trade with our country. Now, without waiting for the signing of the treaty, trade is carried out immediately, and various restrictions are added. What is the basis for this? The spokesperson continued: The opening of Japanese trade, which our country participated in, was announced in the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's basic policy towards Japan, allowing it to participate. President Chiang stated in his broadcast after Japan's surrender that he would take lenient measures. Therefore, the Allied Headquarters' opening of Japanese trade and our country's participation are based on these three documents. Moreover, according to the basic policy set by the Far Eastern Commission, it is stated that during the occupation period, under appropriate control and under the condition of prioritizing the needs of the people of the countries that participated in the war against Japan, Japan may import from abroad the raw materials and other goods needed for peaceful purposes. It can be seen that participating in trade with Japan is actually to meet the requirements of both parties, but with the condition that satisfying the needs of the people of the countries that participated in the war against Japan is prioritized. Therefore, it can be said that our country's participation in trade with Japan is mainly to meet our country's needs. Based on the above reasons, the State Council made this decision.</p>

<h3>Dr. Bu Nerong Talks About American Perceptions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Dr. Bu Nerong (pictured), an expert on Far Eastern issues who came to China for investigation, is an overseas Chinese who grew up in the United States, and his ancestral home is Jilin Province. Dr. Bu is a professor, writer, and speaker. He teaches at Harvard University in the United States, has written many books, and writes for the "Modern Historical Materials" magazine, which is quite famous. Dr. Bu told reporters recently: "I had originally scheduled to go to Beijing next Monday, but Speaker Pan invited me to a banquet, so I changed it to Tuesday. I plan to travel and investigate extensively in China, and will possibly visit North China and the Northeast; in addition to meeting with key government officials and leaders from all walks of life, I also plan to go deep into the countryside to inquire about the living conditions of the people and ways of reform. The expenses for my trip to China are entirely self-funded. I hope to obtain a true understanding of the motherland and bring it back to the United States so that its people can have an accurate understanding of China. Because the observations of ordinary Americans on our country are not very accurate. Regarding our country's political situation, they only know that Chairman Chiang is indeed a loyal and great figure, but he is isolated and helpless, surrounded by some stubborn elements, and the various reforms of the current government are not thorough enough. In a nutshell, Americans still lack trust in Chinese officials. These opinions have a great impact on the government's decision-making. The visit of Special Envoy Wedemeyer this time is to investigate whether the above rumors are true. If he finds that our government is indeed sincere in reforming, I firmly believe that the US government will not only be willing to lend money, but will also further assist China with all its strength." Dr. Bu Nerong also said: "The general American public's perception of the CCP mainly comes from the books of left-wing writers such as Snow and Hot, who regard the CCP as a progressive party that is fighting for the interests of the people. When I return to the country this time, I will decide to conduct field investigations without relying on others, so as to investigate the truth of the motherland and provide it to my American friends." Dr. Bu is scheduled to return to the United States in mid-September.</p>
<h3>Zhonghe Party Hosts Press Conference, Expresses Declaration on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The China Zhonghe Party hosted a press conference in Beijing at 3:00 PM on the 1st, reporting on the party's history and revolutionary process, and issuing the Zhonghe Party's declaration on the current situation. According to the discussion, the party was founded on the National Day twenty-three years before the founding of the Republic of China, and has always regarded the realization of China's national politics as its consistent proposition. It also joined the Tongmenghui led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at that time to jointly overthrow the Manchu Qing and establish the Republic, and then participated in the Northern Expedition and jointly resisted the war. The party advocates that the democratization of politics must take the "nationalization of the army" as a prerequisite and the "democratization of the economy" as the actual guide. In its declaration, the party pointed out its propositions and urgent measures for the current situation: (1) Emergency propositions for domestic affairs: 1 Support the government's general mobilization order to suppress the rebellion and build the country. 2 Quickly seek currency stability and currency system reform to rescue the industrial and commercial crisis. 3 Rural relief should immediately thoroughly formulate a plan and quickly implement it. 4 All political parties in the country should eliminate differences and cooperate with friendly parties that can truly implement the Three Principles of the People. (2) Emergency propositions for international affairs: 1 Make further and practical connections with the diplomacy of the United States and the Soviet Union. 2 Fully develop the spirit of national diplomacy. 3 Conscientiously implement true democratic politics to fully obtain good public opinion, sympathy and assistance in international politics.</p>
<h3>Chiang Chairman Sends Telegram of Condolence to Yu Zailin's Family</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] Chairman Chiang recently sent a telegram of condolence to Yu Zailin's family, saying: Jinzhou, Condolences to the family of the late Director Yu and to Mr. Yu Zailin's family: According to reports, Director Zailin died heroically in the Beipiao Coal Mine, which is shocking. Our country is extremely lacking in coking experts, and social training is not easy. The government has been protecting him, but the common bandits are inherently cruel and murdered him lightly, which is a great loss to the country. The general assembly's painful mourning is truly felt. In addition to instructing a generous pension to comfort his heroic spirit, a special telegram of condolence is sent.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Hosts Banquet for Provincial Chairmen</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] According to the military news agency, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng hosted a banquet for the chairmen of various provinces at his official residence at noon on the 1st. Huang Zhenqiu, Lin Wei and others accompanied him. The host and guests were extremely happy, and the banquet ended after an hour and a half.</p>
<h3>Authoritative Sources Reveal News: Currency System May Be Reformed Within the Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The Four Banks Joint Office recently quoted news from authoritative sources as saying that China may issue a new "managed currency" within this year. It is understood that Minister of Economics Chen Qitian has suggested to the Wedemeyer delegation that issuing a new currency can be a panacea to stop inflation. The Four Banks Joint Office continued that issuing a new currency will cause a major reaction, so the government will proceed cautiously. If it is said that adopting the gold standard, it cannot be implemented in China, because this must be accompanied by free foreign exchange. This would almost cause funds to escape China. As for whether to obtain US loans to support this new currency to be issued, it is still impossible to accurately ascertain whether the government and the Wedemeyer delegation are negotiating. A minister of the National Government told a reporter of this agency that the only difficulty for China to issue a new currency is the lack of funds. Another senior official replied to a reporter of this agency's inquiry about how much capital China needs to support the new currency, saying that it requires 500 million to 1 billion US dollars.</p>
<h3>Liu Handong and Others Resign, Chairman Sends Special Telegram to Retain</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st Dispatch] Liu Handong, chairman of Liaobei Province, and the heads of various departments, resigned jointly due to heavy difficulties. Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram to comfort and retain them. Liu and others are scheduled to return to Siping on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Banking Law Temporarily Postponed for Promulgation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st Dispatch] The Banking Law was completed by the Legislative Yuan some time ago, and three months have passed, but it has not yet been promulgated and implemented by the National Government. The Legislative Yuan has repeatedly urged its promulgation. After the State Council raised it for discussion on the 1st, it believed that the law stipulates a wider scope for the establishment of banks, which should be applicable in peacetime. After the promulgation of the general mobilization order, it may be incompatible with the economic reform plan for controlling finance, which will be promulgated and implemented soon. It was resolved to temporarily postpone promulgation.</p>
<h3>Li Zongren and Others Return to Beiping. Discussion of the North China Situation is Expected to Improve. Wang Hongshao Has Resigned to Run for Legislative Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st Dispatch] Li Zongren, accompanied by the newly appointed Deputy Director of the Xingyuan Office Wu Qiwei and Chief of Staff Xu Qiming, flew back to Beiping from Beijing at 12:30 noon on the 1st. Li said that there would be no changes in the military and political institutions in North China, and the statement that another bandit suppression organization would be established was inaccurate. In the future, more national troops will be transported to the north, and the situation in North China is expected to improve. Li denied that he would run for vice president or the chairman of Gui-Wan, and denied that he had been persuading people. He continued that Chief of Staff Wang Hongshao had resigned due to running for the Legislative Committee, but the statement that he would be appointed as deputy director was inaccurate. Wu Qiwei met with reporters and said that he had retired and is now wearing military uniform again. He came to the ancient capital seventeen years ago, and is very happy to revisit the old place.</p>
<h3>Coal Production Increase Meeting Opens; Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian Explains the Meeting's Purpose</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Coal Production Increase Conference, convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to increase coal production, officially opened in Nanjing on the morning of the 1st. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian personally presided over the meeting, attended by fifty-two representatives from various agencies and units. Minister Chen delivered a speech first, explaining the purpose of convening the meeting, briefly stating: Due to the situation in the north, transportation to the north and south is obstructed. The Ministry, in view of this and as a precautionary measure, specifically convened this meeting, hoping to bring together those responsible from various regions to jointly discuss how to increase production in terms of capital, equipment, foreign exchange, transportation, and safety, so that the supply of coal for civilian, public, and industrial use in the Yangtze River basin will not be disrupted. Furthermore, it aims to accumulate coal reserves, enabling the continued development of industry. This is the first purpose of convening this meeting. If the Yangtze River basin can become self-sufficient in coal and no longer rely on North China, it will not only give hope for the independence of industry in Central China but also allow the surplus coal from North China to be exported. This is the second purpose. Again, the government's control over coal has been much more relaxed after the war than during the War of Resistance, but there are still areas that need to be reviewed to benefit both the public and private sectors. This is another purpose of convening this meeting. Finally, the problem of coal is not only about coal itself; transportation is also of great importance. For example, 300,000 tons of coal are stockpiled at Kailuo but cannot be transported out, while other regions feel a shortage of coal. How to facilitate smooth sea and land transportation so that surpluses and shortages can be mutually supplied is also a major purpose of this meeting. Chen concluded by saying: Among power industries, nothing is more important than coal. Gentlemen, imagine what would happen if the coal supply were cut off, and water, electricity, and transportation in the Shanghai-Nanjing area came to a standstill. He sincerely hoped that all attendees would focus on self-sufficiency in coal, especially in the Yangtze River basin.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session Continues; Production Increase Figures for Each Mine Determined</p>
<p>After Chen's speech, he read President Zhang's address and invited Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee and Director of the Coal Industry Administration Bureau of the Committee, and Gu Yuquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, to deliver speeches, which were full of encouragement. Subsequently, Wang Chongzhi, General Manager of the Beikai Coal Mine, Xu Weiman, Assistant Manager of the Huainan Coal Mine, and Lu Zidong of the East China Coal Mine reported on the situation of their respective mines and their hopes for the government. The speakers described in detail the difficult situation of each mine in recent years and hoped that the authorities would provide more assistance in foreign exchange and transportation to achieve the goal of increasing production as soon as possible, thereby reducing the unnecessary foreign exchange expenditure of the country due to the purchase of foreign coal. Finally, the proposal by Gu Yuquan for the assembly to send a telegram of condolences to the family of Yu Zailin, etc., was passed. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 3:00 PM, chaired by Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Zhang Zizhu. The representatives made the following decisions regarding the figures for the increase in production that should be made by each mine in the Central China region. After the first phase of production increase, the daily output by the end of the 36th year will be: Huainan 3,500 tons, East China 2,000 tons, Zhongxing 500 tons, Dazhong 200 tons, Jiangnan 200 tons, Xiangjiang·Zhongxiang·Huxiang 1,000 tons, Xiangnan 600 tons, Liling 200 tons, Ganxi 200 tons, Changyu 100 tons, and the Tianhe Guanyintan joint mines of Huimin Shouyi, etc. 500 tons, totaling 9,000 tons, i.e., 270,000 tons per month. After the second phase of production increase, the daily output by the end of June of the 37th year will be: Huainan 5,000 tons, East China 2,500 tons, Zhongxing 1,000 tons, Dazhong 400 tons, Jiangnan 500 tons, Xiangjiang·Zhongxiang·Huxiang 1,500 tons, Xiangnan 1,200 tons, Liling 400 tons, Ganxi 500 tons, Changxing 200 tons, and the Tianhe Guanyintan joint mines of Huimin Shouwu, etc. 800 tons, totaling 13,000 tons, i.e., 390,000 tons per month. As for the capital required by each mine, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will request the Executive Yuan to allocate special funds for turnover. The amount requested by each factory will be determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun's Address: Increasing Production and Transportation are Equally Important</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] At the opening session of the Ministry of Economic Affairs Coal Production Increase Conference, President of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun delivered an address, stating: "Coal is the driving force of industry and transportation. Especially in our country, which lacks petroleum resources, whether the implementation of industrial construction plans can achieve the planned progress depends critically on the coordination of coal supply and planned progress. At the same time, now is a period of active suppression of the communists militarily, and the production of coal must especially be coordinated with the requirements of military transportation in order to quickly quell the unrest. Currently, increasing coal production is naturally quite difficult. Most of our country's important coal mines are in the provinces of North China and Northeast China, and these areas are the regions where the communist bandits are most rampant. In the areas occupied by the communist bandits, all coal mines have been completely destroyed. Therefore, the existing coal production throughout the country cannot meet the current needs of industry and railway and shipping transportation. The shortage for this year is approximately six million tons. In today's national financial difficulties, it is still necessary to spend a large amount of foreign exchange to purchase this type of material, which is abundantly stored domestically. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon that must be thoroughly improved in a short period of time. The purpose of our planning for increased production today is not only to meet the current required quantity but also to coordinate with the progress of the country's future construction plans for progressive increases in production. The planning for increased coal production naturally faces many difficulties due to the instability of the situation and the obstruction of transportation. Moreover, many problems are not inherent in the increase in production itself. For example, last year, hundreds of thousands of tons of stockpiled coal could not be transported out due to transportation obstructions. In order to supply the needs of various industrial areas, 500,000 tons were purchased from Vietnam, Australia, and Canada. From this, it can be seen that the current problem is not only increased production; transportation is equally important. The only way to remedy the problem of the disconnect between supply and demand is to focus on regional supply methods. However, the regions with developed industries are not necessarily the regions with abundant coal production. For example, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are the most developed industrial areas, but coal production is not abundant. All of these problems need to be discussed at length by coal mining entrepreneurs and experts. Expanding equipment, improving technology, and improving the lives of workers can all compensate for natural deficiencies. I sincerely hope that everyone will base their discussions on experience and understanding to quickly produce effective methods for increasing production and supply."</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Arrives in Peiping for Inspection; Delivers Remarks and Seeks Political and Economic Intelligence; Scheduled to Meet with Hu Shi and Other Cultural and Educational Figures Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 1st] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party arrived in Peiping at 6:40 PM on the 1st, flying from Nanjing. More than a hundred senior military and political officials and personnel from the US Consulate went to the airport to welcome them. Wedemeyer, wearing a blue suit with white dots, stepped off the plane with a smile. He was introduced by US Consul General in Peiping, Freeman, and shook hands with Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, He Siyuan, Chen Jicheng, Zhang Bojin, and others. Immediately afterward, at the request of reporters, he took a photo with Li Zongren and Chen Jicheng at the airport. When the reporters were taking photos, Wedemeyer repeatedly called out in Chinese, "Too hot, too familiar." He also spoke with Mayor He. He said: Nanjing is too hot; Peiping is cooler. He hoped that Wedemeyer would stay in Peiping for a few more days. Wedemeyer said: I was in Peiping the year before last, but it is a pity that Mayor He was still in Shandong, so we did not meet. I am very happy to meet you today. After the photography, Wedemeyer immediately went to the US Consulate in Dongjiaominxiang in a specially prepared blue car with the number 10050, accompanied by Freeman and Li Zongren, to rest. Today is US Air Force Day, and the US military in Peiping is holding a commemorative evening party and invited the entire special envoy delegation to participate. Wedemeyer, feeling tired from the long flight, was afraid that he would not be able to attend. He will have dinner at the consulate tonight and exchange opinions with the US personnel in Peiping after the meal. Wedemeyer is scheduled to visit Li Zongren at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, Sun Lianzhong at 10:00 AM, and Mayor He at 11:30 AM. In the afternoon, he will meet separately with cultural and educational figures such as Hu Shi and Liang Qiushui. At 8:00 PM, Freeman will host a banquet to entertain the special envoy delegation and invite more than a hundred people from military, political, and educational circles to accompany them. Li Zongren will host a banquet for the Wedemeyer delegation at noon on the 2nd. On the same day, from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, Mayor He will host a dinner at the Summer Palace and enjoy the moonlit scenery of Kunming Lake. According to Wedemeyer's news officer, Watson, Wedemeyer does not plan to go to Zhangjiakou or Dalian. Liang Qiushui, the person in charge of the reformist faction of the Democratic Socialist Party in the north, has also published his open letter, "Contribution to Special Envoy Wedemeyer," asking Wedemeyer to pay attention to the lives of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 1st] Upon arriving in Peiping on the 1st, Special Envoy Wedemeyer issued a written statement from the special envoy delegation at the airport, stating: "Some of the information collected by the delegation in ten days is extremely valuable and can reconfirm the information we have obtained in the past. This is what the special envoy delegation urgently needs. New information provided by various parties, including official and civilian personnel, has proven to be useful. The materials provided by private individuals and representatives of various groups have greatly assisted the delegation in its collection and are greatly appreciated. The number of letters sent by patriotic Chinese citizens in their private capacity is also large and constructive. We will continue to study and discuss the information they provide and meet with individuals. After our trip to Peiping, we will also go to Shenyang and various cities in North China and Northeast China. We hope that the original information we obtain on this trip regarding the actual political and economic situation in these two regions will be effective. Our time in the north is very short, so we must devote all our efforts to 'truth-seeking' and 'analysis' work. We will stay in Peiping for three days. Future plans are still under consideration and will be announced when a decision is made."</p>
<h3>Mission Completes Sorting Data Obtained in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Wedemeyer took a Samsung special plane from Dajiao Airport at 3:40 PM on the 1st to fly to Peiping. In addition to five consultants, including Jenkins, and Adjutant Captain Bauer, and Interpreter Captain Wu Hanmin, there was also US Embassy spokesman Connors, plus nine driving officers and soldiers, a total of eighteen people on the plane. Those who came to the airport to see them off were only Secretary Tenno of the Embassy, Li Zhishan, Deputy Director of the Lih Chih She, and six or seven reporters.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The US Embassy announced that Wedemeyer led most of his mission personnel to Peiping on the afternoon of the 1st to continue the investigation. He will stay in Peiping for three days and then continue to Shenyang, Tianjin, and Qingdao, and possibly stop briefly in another location. Wedemeyer and his party will return to Nanjing in a week. In the past four days in Nanjing, the mission has completed two tasks. One is that the data obtained in Shanghai has been systematically sorted, and the other is that some new data has been collected from the letters received and the interviews of Wedemeyer and his consultants. The mission attaches great importance to the many letters received from groups and individuals and believes that some letters contain valuable information and suggestions. Wedemeyer and his consultants have carefully considered each letter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] Wedemeyer changed his flight date to the afternoon of the 5th to fly from Peiping to Shenyang to inspect the Northeast and is scheduled to stay for two days, planning to leave Shenyang on the morning of the 7th?

<h3>Accounting for Fifteen Years of Blood Debt; Excavating Remains at Pingdingshan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Pingdingshan, 30th] Today, your reporter participated in the excavation of the remains of the dead at Pingdingshan, the site of the first mass slaughter of our innocent people by the Japanese invaders. Pingdingshan is located six kilometers southeast of Fushun. Before the September 18th Incident, Fushun miners built houses on the hillside and lived there, about 500 households. On September 15th of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), Deng Tiemei and Tang Juwu, leaders of the Northeast Volunteer Army, led their troops to attack Fushun at night, entering the mining area from the Pingdingshan area. The Japanese were caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. In a fit of anger, they falsely accused the residents of Pingdingshan of "colluding with bandits" and collectively slaughtered the old, weak, women, and children in the area. Afterward, they poured oil on the corpses and cremated them, burying the remains at the foot of the mountain. At that time, more than 2,700 people were killed, and only 50-odd people survived. The dead have been wronged for fifteen years. Today, Yue Chengan, President of the Military Tribunal of the Northeast Headquarters of the Executive Yuan, went to Pingdingshan to exhume the bones and collect evidence in preparation for accounting for this great blood debt. More than ten workers held hoes and excavated at the foot of both sides of the mountain. Only two feet into the ground, white bones were visible, mixed with more than ten silver dollars, hairpins, and glass smoking pipes. All the excavating workers burst into tears because they were either relatives of the dead or survivors who had personally experienced the scene at that time. Therefore, they were overwhelmed with grief at the sight of the objects.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of a Peace Treaty with Japan; Our Country Takes a Cautious Approach; Formal Conference Should be Held in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on the 1st that our country's reply to the United States' invitation to convene a preliminary conference on a peace treaty with Japan was submitted as early as July 17th, but the full text of the reply will not be released at this time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] China hopes that the conference on a peace treaty with Japan will be held within China and insists on a voting method that prevents the Soviet Union or any country from hindering the proceedings of the conference. According to diplomatic circles who have exchanged views on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, experts from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs intend to submit the following preliminary wishes: (1) The formal peace treaty conference should be held within China, approximately in Shanghai. (2) All countries involved in the war against Japan should attend the conference, not limited to the four countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and China. (3) The voting procedure of the formal conference must be approved by more than half of the attending representatives and three-quarters of the four major powers. This procedure is especially effective when any country attempts to obstruct the conference. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reporter to the United Press, China is taking a completely cautious attitude toward the issue of a peace treaty and is not in a hurry to sign a peace treaty with Japan. China, which has fresh memories of the Japanese invasion, will never allow itself to forget the danger of new aggression. We must be sure that the peace treaty can guarantee that China and other countries in Asia will no longer be harmed by Japanese ambitions in the future. China's proposed voting plan will be presented for the first time at the preliminary meeting to be convened by the United States soon. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun to notify the US government that China is willing to cooperate in preliminary exchanges of views on a peace treaty with Japan. The Chinese government, due to the ongoing civil strife and economic insecurity, fears that the treaty, even if it does not allow Japan to restore its military position in the Far East, will be a precursor to its economic recovery.</p>
<h3>If the Soviet Union Obstructs the Peace Conference, It Will Re-Energize Japan</h3>
<p>American Reporter Kern Returns to the United States and Reports</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 31st] According to Kern, the international editor of Newsweek who returned here from Japan, if the Soviet Union implements a policy of opposing the convening of a peace conference with Japan and continues to use its "obstruction" tactics, the United States will revitalize Japan. Kern stated in the latest issue of Newsweek: "If the Soviet Union opposes the peace conference with Japan, it will be unable to obstruct the United States except by inciting strikes in Japan. However, in order to have effective strikes, the communist-controlled unions will inevitably be public and may encounter suppression by the occupying authorities." Kern stated that if the Soviet Union takes other more dangerous measures, such as providing increasing and overt assistance to the Chinese Communists, it is not entirely impossible that the United States will not only revitalize Japan industrially, but also militarily.</p>

<h3>UNRRA to Intensify Protection of Water Conservancy Projects in Various Areas</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] During this summer and autumn flood season, engineers from UNRRA and the Ministry of Water Conservancy are intensifying the protection of water conservancy projects throughout the country undertaken by UNRRA. In the Yellow River area, under the guidance of Chief Engineer Todd, they are making every effort to prevent possible floods. However, their efforts can only be effective if military operations along the river are stopped and the safety of the levee repair workers is guaranteed. Since the government notified UNRRA that it could not guarantee the safety of levee repair personnel, UNRRA's participation in repairing and strengthening the river dikes has come to a halt. However, if the Yellow River were to burst its banks, the people of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei would suffer unprecedented disasters. The UNRRA Central Committee has repeatedly appealed to President Chiang Kai-shek, and UNRRA Director General Major General Rooks formally wrote to the President on July 28 to discuss the matter, requesting the President to provide UNRRA's levee repair personnel with appropriate facilities and issue necessary formal instructions to the leaders in the area. This matter is currently being discussed in Nanjing. In addition to the Yellow River project, there are seven other UNRRA-sponsored water conservancy projects. In the Huai River area and the Grand Canal area, there are four UNRRA experts under the guidance of a Dutch engineer, ready to deal with rapid water level rises at any time. In the Huai River project, UNRRA has supplied 800,000 sandbags to prevent possible dike collapses, and 160,000 have also been supplied for the Grand Canal water conservancy project. The Huai River project, which had been suspended in the past due to high water levels, has now resumed. UNRRA and CNRRA are providing personnel, flour, cash, and equipment. It is hoped that this project will be completed by the end of this year.</p>

Chen returned to the country on the 22nd of last month to report on his work and will return to his post in the Philippines in about two weeks.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Expedite Fuel Self-Sufficiency!</h3>
<p>To bring up the issue of our country's fuel self-sufficiency today may seem impossible. However, fuel self-sufficiency should be our national policy from now on - we must move in this direction. Needless to say, we rely on foreign countries for liquid fuels. Even for coal, we must rely on foreign countries. Coal from Vietnam's Tonkin and the Dutch East Indies' Sumatra is still being imported to supply our markets, even though we lack foreign exchange funds today. How can we not feel hidden pain or worry! All our efforts from now on must be focused on seeking our self-sufficiency. One of the main projects is undoubtedly fuel self-sufficiency. In this sense, we welcome the convening of meetings such as the Coal Production Increase Conference. According to reports, the convening of this conference is aimed at remedying the interruption of coal sources in North and Northeast China. Its purpose and the goal of fuel self-sufficiency are far apart. However, it must be said that it is gratifying that the government can convene this conference at this time to conduct a planned review and comprehensive plan for increasing coal production.</p>
<p>Originally, most of China's coal mines that had already been operated and had a considerable scale were concentrated in North China and Northeast China. The Kaiyuan, Zhongxing, Jingxing, Jiaozuo, and Beipiao mines were all in North China. Needless to say, Fushun, which is world-renowned. However, Changxing in Zhejiang and Pingxiang in Jiangxi were also famous coal-producing areas in the country. Among them, the coal in Pingxiang, together with the iron in Daye and the steel in Hanyang, formed Hanyeping, whose important position in our country's economic history was comparable to that of the Ruhr area in Germany. The Changxing coal mine in Zhejiang was a famous coal area in the southeast, and it was operated early with huge investments. What we don't understand is that, two years after the victory, at a time when our country is short of fuel, we have not heard of active operations of the Pingxiang and Changxing mines. Is this because the government lacks an overall policy on coal mine operations? Or are there other reasons?</p>
<p>It is true that the coal in Changxing and Pingxiang may have problems in production and transportation. But can these problems not be solved at all? We believe that the main problem is still a matter of policy and efficiency. Since the establishment of the Resources Commission, all mineral resources in the country, even if not completely operated directly by the Resources Commission, must be subject to the commission. This cannot but be said to be a considerable blow to the people. It is said that the shutdown of the Pingxiang coal mine was due to the fact that the iron smelting part of Hanyeping was changed to state-owned, which was affected as a result. The problem here is: If the entire Hanyeping is to be changed to state-owned, why can the shutdown of the Pingxiang coal mine be allowed? Is this still the government's lack of policy? Or is it the decline in administrative efficiency? As for the Changxing coal mine in Zhejiang, it took a lot of effort to operate in the beginning, and a railway was built to facilitate coal transportation. At this time when coal is urgently needed, sitting idly by and letting it be abandoned, we don't know what the reason is.</p>
<p>The convening of this Coal Production Increase Conference cannot but make people feel like they are putting out a fire. However, even to put out a fire, we hope that they can come up with a solution. Moreover, what is valuable about the solution is not only that it can be produced, but also that it can be actively implemented and implemented effectively. What we hope even more is that, due to the convening of this Coal Production Increase Conference, we can expedite fuel self-sufficiency, and we can only achieve our goal when we can stop relying on imported fuels.</p>
<h3>Opening of Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>The issue of opening trade with Japan has been approved by the State Council yesterday. The discussion phase of this case has ended and will enter the stage of how to open it.</p>
<p>There are naturally many areas that should be studied here, and the two most urgent ones are: (1) the types of goods to be imported and exported to Japan, and (2) the selection of personnel for the inspection team to Japan.</p>
<p>We believe that imported goods should be limited to things that our country does not have or produces very little of. The key is that they can meet our urgent needs without competing with domestic goods and hindering the survival of domestic factories. As for exports, we should mainly focus on what we have in excess and do not need to use ourselves. As for whether it is raw material or finished product, this is a secondary matter.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the selection of personnel for the inspection team, in addition to the competent authorities related to trade with Japan, we should select and assign personnel who have purple research. We should also send more representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors, and it is appropriate to have people who are actually engaged in industry, who are knowledgeable, and experienced. Our opinion is that these personnel should preferably be nominated by domestic manufacturers themselves, because they know the advantages and disadvantages most clearly, and only they are more concerned. As for those pro-Japanese elements who specialized in doing business with Japan in the past, and ordinary street politicians and trendy bureaucrats, I am afraid they have other functions and may not necessarily plan everything on the premise of national industry.</p>
<p>Many people are worried that once trade with Japan is opened, goods from Japan will pour in continuously, gradually returning to the pre-war phenomenon of Japanese goods dumping. This seems to be an overstatement in today's era of strict control over import and export trade. However, foreign goods smuggling is rampant today. Hong Kong, as a transit port, is a major loophole in current controlled trade. After the opening of trade with Japan, we earnestly hope that the authorities will take further strict measures to prevent the limited import from becoming an informal unlimited opening.</p>

However, many of them were deposited before or during the war. To date, a lot of storage fees are owed. If they are moved out now and calculated according to the date, the amount is quite large, and some people will not be able to afford it. Representatives from the Health Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the funeral homes negotiated the formulation of measures yesterday morning and stipulated principles. If the storage time is long, the storage fee can be reduced so that the coffin owners can afford to transport them back for burial.</p>

<h3>Two Fires on Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Trains; Extinguished Early Morning, Fortunately No Injuries; Arson Suspect Arrested</h3>
<p>The 23rd first and second class express train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line departed from Shanghai for Hangzhou at 6:45 AM yesterday. At 9:15 AM, while the train was passing Jiaxing Station, a fire suddenly broke out in the fourth first-class carriage behind the locomotive. The conductor noticed it and used the emergency signal to stop the train. After an emergency brake and rescue efforts, the fire was extinguished. Fortunately, no passengers were killed or injured. After the carriage was detached, the train continued to Hangzhou, with a slight delay.</p>
<p>Train No. 54 on the Beijing-Shanghai line was passing Danyang Station at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning when thick smoke suddenly billowed from a fourth-class carriage, followed by raging flames. Passengers panicked and fled, causing great disorder. Fortunately, the railway police on board discovered it and quickly used fire extinguishers to put out the fire, averting a major incident. While fighting the fire, the railway police noticed a passenger named Wang Cunhua, wearing a blue short shirt, acting flustered. While the police were extinguishing the fire, he suddenly threw a glass bottle out of the window. The railway police broke the bottle, immediately questioned him. The suspect stammered evasively. Suspecting him of serious wrongdoing, the railway police immediately took him to the Danyang Police Section. Under strict questioning, the suspect only claimed to be an ordinary passenger returning to Beijing from Shanghai, citing facts to prove his claim. The railway police retrieved the glass bottle he had thrown away from the railway track for confrontation. At this point, the suspect's face suddenly changed, but he still denied setting the fire. He was then taken to Nanjing for further strict questioning. Realizing he could no longer deny it, the suspect admitted that the fire source belonged to him and that the glass bottle contained "ether" and nitric acid. He also admitted to being a drug dealer and that the items he carried were raw materials for making drugs, and the burning paper package on the train contained nitric acid. Police Chief Wang Zhaohu believed that the suspect's confession was contradictory and that he had set the fire while the railway police were unprepared, attempting to disrupt the security of the two lines. However, based on his statement that the fire source he carried was raw material for drug production, experts are currently being consulted for research. At the same time, further investigation is being ordered to uncover the truth of the case.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Black Market Gold; Three "Dan Bang" Confess Without Reservation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the case of the police局 cracking down on a large-scale smuggling of black market gold gang published in this newspaper yesterday, the Administration Office of the Bureau has issued the following account of the cracking of the case: On the 31st of last month, the Economic Section of this office received a tip that three gold smugglers had flown from Hankou to Shanghai on the 27th aboard a China National Aviation Corporation passenger plane, using their specially made vests to bring a total of 75 gold bars, weighing approximately 750 taels. They had sold them in batches on the black market in Shanghai through the broker Ku Bingyan. Part of the proceeds were remitted to Hankou through the Shanghai Trust Company. The three were preparing to leave Shanghai for Hankou on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an轮 at noon that day. Section Chief Xu Youzuo immediately dispatched officers to the wharf and arrested the three in the dining room of the steamer. Three specially made vests and remittance receipts from the Shanghai Trust Company worth 800 million yuan and odd checks worth over 100 million yuan were seized on the spot. After strict interrogation at the Bureau, they confessed without reservation. An immediate search was launched for the black market organization and broker Ku Bingyan who had sold the gold for them. Ku was arrested by yesterday morning, but his confession was cunning, and he remained uncooperative until late at night. The police局 has notified the Central Bank to urgently telegraph the Hankou bank to stop payment of the remittance from the Shanghai Trust Company. In addition, it has been learned that the number of gold bars smuggled by the three was 35 by Chen Kechang and 40 each by Hu Zhengshan and Wu Xingwen. The remittance receipts worth 800 million yuan seized by the police局 at the time were from the sale of Chen Kechang's gold bars. The funds of the other two are still under investigation.</p>

<h3>Hong Weilie Murder Case; Vendetta More Likely Than Love Affair</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, stars glittered in the grand auditorium of the China Funeral Parlor on Haig Road. Jin Yan, Liu Qiong, Pei Chong, Bai Lu, Wang Renmei, Han Langan, and dozens of other film industry practitioners, including the great directors Fei Mu and Wu Yonggang, mourned the famous photographer Hong Weilie, who was shot dead on the night of July 29th. The vast auditorium, with only forty-odd people, appeared even more desolate. Since abandoning film to engage in business ten years ago, Hong Weilie had drifted apart from his friends in the film industry. His old friends have no opinion on the occurrence of this unfortunate event, other than hoping for an early resolution of the case, and cannot provide any clues. However, judging from Hong Weilie's personality, family, and economic environment, it is more reasonable to say that this is a vendetta than a love affair, because Hong Weilie is already 47 years old this year and has seven children.</p>
<p>Hong Weilie's involvement in the film industry began in the silent film era. He studied in Japan, studying in the army, but usually loved photography, and had a lot of research on photography. After returning to China, he raised funds to set up a film company. After that, he joined the Lianhua Company as a photographer, and his reputation gradually increased. When he made films, he paid special attention to the light source, with unique ingenuity, making ugly things beautiful, and dull things lively, creating a new era in the history of Chinese film photography. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, he joined "China Electric", and his first film "Secret Code" was a sensation. His photography was again re-evaluated. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he edited and shot battlefield newsreels. "Children of China" and "Long Sky Thousands of Miles" are his masterpieces, and also his last works. In the 31st year of the Republic of China, "Long Sky Thousands of Miles" was released, and he left the film industry at that time, because the family burden made him look for a job that was more profitable than photography.</p>
<p>He came to Shanghai to engage in commerce after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. He followed General Fan Shaozeng to Shanghai and lived in Fan's mansion at No. 11 Dumei Road, but his family remained in Chongqing, Shangqing Temple, the former residence of General Fan, and was not brought to Shanghai. His acquaintance with General Fan was not too long. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, "China Electric" retreated from Wuhan to Chongqing, and there was no photography studio. General Fan had an indoor tennis court, which could be easily transformed into an ideal studio. At the request of "China Electric", General Fan generously agreed to borrow it. Hong Weilie met General Fan at that time, because he often accompanied General Fan to play ball, the feelings gradually deepened. His bold, straightforward and righteous personality was deeply appreciated by General Fan, so after the victory, he worked in General Fan's Yuzeng Trading Company. Fan was also very sad about Hong's murder, and all the funeral expenses were handled by Fan himself.</p>
<p>More Silent Than Before; It is rumored that the cause of this tragedy was a romantic dispute, because Hong Weilie once lived with the dancer Shen Ying, but after the police局 investigation, no new clues were found on Shen Ying. His eldest son, Hong Wenda, happened to come to Shanghai from Chongqing shortly before he was assassinated to take the university entrance examination. Besides grief, he couldn't say anything about his father's sudden assassination. A relative of Hong Weilie said that the last time she met him, Hong Weilie was in a bad mood, saying that he was not feeling well, and he was more silent than before. This cannot be said to be his premonition of being killed. As for rumors that he borrowed a pistol from a friend a few days ago to defend himself, it is not possible to determine how much it is related to the tragedy before the police局's investigation is over. However, according to the speculation of most people, this case is complicated on the surface, but simple in reality, and there will be a day when the truth comes to light.</p>

<h3>Handover Ceremony Held for New and Old Police Chiefs; Mayor Wu Presided Over the Delivery of the Seal of Office</h3>
<p>The handover ceremony for the new and old police chiefs of the Municipal Police Bureau was held at the Bureau's square at 9:00 AM yesterday. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony, and all senior officials of the Bureau and the chiefs of various precincts attended on time. The ceremony was solemn. At the beginning of the ceremony, Mayor Wu led the outgoing Chief Xuan Tiewu and the incoming Chief Yu Shuping into the venue amidst music. Everyone stood up to pay their respects, and the atmosphere was very serious. Then the seal was handed over. Chief Xuan handed the seal to Mayor Wu, who then transferred it to Chief Yu.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech: Thank You, Commander Xuan</p>
<p>In his speech, Mayor Wu said: (1) Commander Xuan has been concurrently serving as the police chief for over a year and has been in charge of the handover work, which was very difficult. After the handover, he worked harder to maintain law and order, so that Shanghai could be stable under complex circumstances. I express my deep gratitude, which is also felt by the 4 million citizens of Shanghai. Commander Xuan has resigned several times due to health reasons. This time, the central government approved his resignation from the concurrent position, but Commander Xuan is still responsible for the important task of Shanghai's security, and we will still be able to cooperate in the future. (2) The new Chief Yu has assisted Commander Xuan in maintaining local security in the past, and has also been here for more than two years. He is familiar with the local situation, and will make greater contributions to the municipal administration work of this city in the future.</p>
<p>Two Wishes for All Police Officers</p>
<p>At this time of transition between the old and new chiefs, a police incident occurred. The central government has sent senior officials to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate, and it will definitely be handled in accordance with national law. However, after the occurrence of this case, the general public felt that confidence in Shanghai's security had been lost. I hope that all police officers in the various police precincts will pay attention to restoring public confidence. First, they must fulfill their responsibilities, and second, they must distinguish right from wrong. They must work hard in their own positions and maintain the glorious reputation of the past. Under the leadership of the new chief, they will have even more special performance.</p>
<p>Outgoing Chief Xuan's Farewell Speech</p>
<p>Then, outgoing Chief Xuan delivered a speech, recalling that in the past two years of his tenure, relying on the unified spirit of unity from top to bottom, he had achieved remarkable results in his work, expressing his joy and gratitude, and taking "Act with responsibility, be thrifty to cultivate integrity, be fair in dealing with affairs, and treat people with sincerity" as a farewell message. After that, Chief Yu delivered a speech, briefly stating that he felt ashamed for not having made any contribution to his work in the two years he followed Commander Xuan, and that in the future he would act in accordance with Xuan's. Under the guidance of the wise Mayor Wu, he will fulfill his duties loyally and be willing to encourage each other with his colleagues.</p>
<p>Handover Ceremony for New and Old Police Chiefs</p>
<p>After the ceremony was completed at 10:10 AM, the new and old chiefs handled the handover procedures in the club on the seventh floor of the Bureau, with Ge Kexin, a consultant of the Municipal Government, supervising the handover. Chief Xuan led the chiefs of the police局 to hand over, and Chief Yu ordered the chiefs to "return the original handover". After the handover procedures were completed, Xuan and Yu convened the chiefs of the various precincts on the eighth floor for instructions. At about 11:00 AM, Yu led all his subordinates to respectfully send off former Chief Xuan. Departed from the Bureau.</p>
<p>Police Chief Yu Announces Future Administrative Policies</p>
<p>After taking office, Police Chief Yu Shuping issued a written statement on his future administrative policies, which are as follows: (1) For future administrative policies, we should still continue to implement the administrative guidelines and the original work plan formulated by former Chief Xuan. (2) Former Chief Xuan's spirit of perseverance and sincere love has inspired us. In the future, we should follow his original intention and handle matters according to his wishes. (3) In order to strengthen the police force, on the one hand, we should improve the quality of police officers and continue to strengthen training, and on the other hand, we should rectify the discipline of police officers and improve service ethics. (4) The police system should be coordinated with the overall municipal administration. In the future, we should strive to strengthen the relationship between them in order to exert work efficiency. (5) At a time when prices are soaring and police officers are struggling to live, it is important to handle police welfare undertakings. (6) All the personnel of this bureau are comrades who have shared weal and woe for the past two years. I hope that they will maintain their original intentions and serve with peace of mind. (7) The unfortunate incident at the Jindu Theater has caused such a great loss to the police局. I deeply regret that I hope that the senior officials of the central government will make proper and reasonable arrangements in the shortest possible time. (8) The police work in this city is heavy and complicated. I am afraid that I am not capable of doing it myself. Fortunately, under the leadership of the wise Mayor and Yi Commander, I have inherited from them, and I hope that everyone will give me more assistance and encouragement, so as to avoid falling.</p>
<p>Also, the chiefs of the various bureaus and the chiefs of the various precincts of the police局 have not changed. The resignation of Xu Xu, the former director of the Personnel Office, has been approved, and the Municipal Government has transferred Wu Jie, the third section chief of the Personnel Office, to succeed him. He took office yesterday.</p>

<h3>Abbot of Longhua Temple; Yong Chan Tried for the First Time; Accuser Appears in Court to Testify; Defendant Denies Colluding with the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Following the German-speaking Mi Jia, Yong Chan, the former abbot of Longhua Temple, was also accused of being a suspected traitor.

Yong Chan was accused of colluding with the Japanese monk Zuo Teng during the fall of Shanghai to seize the position of abbot of Longhua Temple, set up the Sino-Japanese Buddhist Association, and colluded with local powerful forces to sell the land of Longhua Temple without authorization. The accuser, the former abbot of the temple, Xin Ci, and the supervisor, Hui Zheng, appeared in court to criticize the situation one by one.

The court ruled that the case still needs to be investigated in detail, and ordered that the hearing be adjourned and rescheduled. Yong Chan was still released on bail.</p>

<h3>Americans Look at Next Year's World Games Track and Field May Dominate Sweden and Finland are Two Strong Rivals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York Airmail] Americans firmly believe that they can dominate the World Games to be held in London next year, with Sweden coming in second and Finland taking a close third.</p>
<p>American sports figures estimate that at the World Games: the United States will fail in long-distance track events, but in sprints and skill-oriented events, the United States can score enough points to make up for it. In short, the United States believes that they have too much strength in all aspects and are not easily defeated by any other country. The United States is confident of winning for another reason, which is that the participating teams from the United Kingdom, France, and Italy have all been greatly weakened due to the impact of the war. Whether the Soviet Union will participate is still in doubt, so judging from the current situation, the athletes of the United States only believe that Sweden may be a strong rival to the United States.</p>
<p>Amateur Athletic Union Games</p>
<p>From the performance of the American athletes who participated in the 60th anniversary games of the Amateur Athletic Union of America, we can get a glimpse of the strength of the American team participating in the World Games. In the above-mentioned games, the top American track and field athletes broke three records and tied two American track and field records. The best result was the javelin record created by Schumer of the Los Angeles Athletic Club, with a result of 148 feet, only ten feet short of the world record held by the Finnish representative. The other two record-breaking events were the 2,900-meter mixed relay, with a result of 7 minutes and 4.3 seconds, and the 400-meter relay, with a result of 40.9 seconds. (The winners were all from the St. Anthony Athletic Club) The two national records tied were Dillard's 200-meter low hurdles, with a result of 23.3 seconds, and the Los Angeles Athletic Club's 1,600-meter relay, with a result of 3 minutes and 15 seconds. American sports figures remember that the weakness of the American team participating in the World Games is long-distance running. They believe that the United States will have no hope of scoring points in long-distance track events from half a mile to the marathon. It is speculated that Swedish long-distance runners will dominate the long-distance running events from half a mile, and other European countries may also help. American sports figures know that Sweden has excellent long-distance runners who can create a 1,500-meter record in 3 minutes and 48 seconds, and Sweden has six more long-distance runners whose performance is within two seconds of this amazing record.</p>
<p>Strength of Athletes from Other Countries</p>
<p>Regarding the excellent athletes from other countries, according to American surveys: the Netherlands has one named Girikxius, whose 1,500-meter performance is 3 minutes and 50.4 seconds, and France has one named Han Baona, whose 1,500-meter performance is 3 minutes and 48.5 seconds. In the 5,000-meter event, three Swedish long-distance runners, British Woodson, Finnish Hanro, and Czech Chatobek all have world record-level performances. In the 10,000-meter event, Finnish Hanro and five Swedish long-distance runners have a controlling advantage. In the marathon, Sweden has many strong players. In addition, Finnish Hettonan and Korean Xu Yongfu have hopes of winning the championship. The American Amateur Athletic Union authorities are not very hopeful that the American women's team will win the track and field championship at next year's World Games. In the American Women's Amateur Advanced and Junior Games held in St. Anthony recently, there was not even one female athlete who could achieve anything close to the American record. Ferris, the secretary of the American Amateur Athletic Union, said: "American women's interest in track and field has greatly decreased. We lack large and fat girls, which other countries have." Despite the above-mentioned difficulties and strong rivals, the United States hopes to score more points in sprints and skill-oriented events so that they can win the championship in the World Games.</p>
<h3>China Youth Volleyball Main Force Battle Huayan Lost to the Soviet Union After the Replay, the Two Teams Re-Decide the Championship</h3>
<p>In the China Youth Volleyball Tournament, the Soviet team avenged their previous defeat last night. After five hard-fought games, they finally defeated Cong and now the two teams have equal records. They will wait for the replay to be completed before re-deciding the champion. There were a total of three men's and women's games yesterday. In the women's group game, Jinde Bai vs. Fuhua was quite tense. As a result, Fuhua defeated Jinde Bai by two to one. In the second act, Huayan B from the second middle school vs. Zhi Team, Huayan B always took the upper hand and won two games to celebrate the victory.</p>
<p>The final act of the A-level game is related to the championship. Huayan has never been defeated since its debut. Yu Xunzhong once defeated the Soviet Union by three to two. If they win again in yesterday's game, the championship will be in their pocket. The Soviet Union has also only lost this one game, and their hopes for the championship are not completely lost. Yesterday, they met Huayan again, and the enemies met on a narrow road. At 7 PM, the two heroes took the stage. Huayan played quite smoothly in the first game, taking the lead with 21 to 18. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Soviet Union fiercely fought in the second and third games and turned the tide, 21 to 10, 21 to 18, and reversed the lead in two consecutive games. In the fourth game, Huayan was unwilling to lag behind and desperately fought. The effect was immediately visible. 21 to 9, they easily tied the game at two each. In the final game, both sides were at the critical moment of life and death, and the battle was fierce. Huayan was exhausted to cope, and their forces gradually showed signs of weakness, gradually falling behind. As a result, the Soviet Union won with 21 to 17 and avenged their previous defeat, with the scores equal for both sides. After Huayan and Yongsha Hong complete the replay, if Huayan wins, they will re-decide the championship. If Yongsha wins, the championship will fall into the hands of the foreign army. The results of each game yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Fuhua wins Jinde Bai (Women) 21-12, 18-21, 21-11. (2) Huayan B wins the Zhi Team (Middle B) 21-11, 21-12. (3) The Soviet Union wins Huayan (Group A) 18-21, 21-10, 21-18, 9-21, 21-17.</p>

<h3>Various Industrial Trade Associations Strive for Raw Material Quota Allocation Rights</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Send Representatives to Petition in Beijing Next Wednesday</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Import Quota Raw Material Allocation Review Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 4 PM yesterday. More than 50 representatives from various industrial trade associations, including Tian He and Pan Shihao, Wang Zhuyi, Gu Qiu, etc., passed the following proposals:</p>
<p>(A) Emergency Measures (1) Please ask the Import Control Committee to announce the first phase of quota allocation to Hejia and the amount of quota. (2) If various industrial trade associations have not won quotas, each will send representatives to negotiate with the Import Management Committee. (3) In addition to describing the reasons in detail in official documents to request quotas from the Import Control Committee, various industrial trade associations will also publicize in various newspapers the necessity of directly allocating industrial raw materials to factories.</p>
<p>(B) Should Continue to Send Personnel to Beijing to Promote (1) Rigidly stipulate the allocation ratio of quota raw materials between industry and commerce. (2) Order the Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to jointly organize a review committee to review the import quotas for industry and commerce, and order the Import Control Committee not to allow any association to apply before the review. (3) Suppress importers manipulating the market and refusing to sign contracts. (4) Allow factories to freely handle foreign exchange and order raw materials from abroad when the quota raw materials are less than three months' worth. (5) Establish specialized institutions in the short term to supply the needs of various industrial raw materials?</p>
<p>(C) Fundamental Solutions (1) For the sake of maintaining industry, the government should provide special speed and convenience to factories that need raw materials to directly import from abroad and apply to the Import Control Committee for import licenses. (2) Factories that need raw materials should request the government to directly allocate quotas and then order from importers. In addition to obtaining legitimate profits, importers must not impose extra harsh conditions. Otherwise, factories should be allowed to directly order raw materials from overseas. (3) The government should directly supply the manufacturing factories with industrial raw materials ordered at official exchange rates to avoid waste caused by corruption. It is inconsistent with the principle for vendors to request quotas on the pretext of supplying factories outside Shanghai. The government should entrust the local branches of the Industrial Association to handle this matter. (4) Importers claim that the imported raw materials are also allocated to factories, but it is questionable whether importers can evenly supply various industrial factories with imported raw materials and not add various conditions other than profits. Therefore, the government should still entrust the industrial associations to centrally allocate various imported raw materials. And designate legal representatives to check whether the prices of the raw materials imported by importers exceed the legal prices.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it was decided that each industrial trade association would send one to two representatives to petition in Beijing on the 11 PM night train next Wednesday (6th), and after entertaining Nanjing newspaper reporters on the afternoon of the 7th, they would return to Shanghai at 3:45 PM that afternoon. [Another News] Representatives of various industrial trade associations expressed the following regarding the State Council's approval of the "partial" opening of trade with Japan: (1) Please ask the government to explain "partial" opening and determine its scope. (2) Approve of what is beneficial to our country's industry and commerce within the defined scope, and resolutely oppose what is harmful to the end.</p>
<h3>Multiple Large-Scale Supply and Sales Hua Shares Turn Weak at Closing</h3>
<p>Shares struggled very hard yesterday. Yarn and cotton traders bought enthusiastically, but the actual goods chips of Guangdong traders and yarn factories were still flowing out in large quantities. High prices could not last, and finally fell at the close, ending in weakness. Except for Xinguang, which was determined due to buying factors, the second-hottest and miscellaneous shares were stable, and Yonggong's trading was limited and also rose. The situation was still loose and optimistic.</p>
<p>When the market opened in the morning, the report that trade between China and Japan was bound to open and that the increase in the cost of living index would not have much impact, it continued the momentum of the previous close and opened higher. After Di Yongs yarn opened as high as 235 yuan, Nos. 32 and 232 settled, falling slightly. Nos. 223, 154, 157, and 197 advanced again, and then rose to 231.6 yuan. Nos. 108, 142, 143, and 160 were supplied, falling to 230 yuan. Nos. 97, 104, and 76 still advanced, pulling up slightly.

Jingfu Huafeng was not optimistic. After the close, Yongs yarn was lowered slightly by the supply from Nos. 73 and 76. As a result, compared with the previous close, that is, the delivery shares, Yongs yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Huafeng, Jingfu, and Qinxing declined slightly, Xinguang and Xinhua rose slightly, Yonggong's transaction was sparse, and the price was raised by a small amount. Sino-French and domestic goods were flat, Shangwu Rongfeng fell by half, Zean Zhongfang Datong rose slightly, Jinglun Tongyi underwear declined slightly, matches rose by half, and Zhongsi also rose by a small amount. In the delivery shares, only Xinguang rose slightly, while Yongs yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Huafeng, and Jingfu declined slightly. Outside the market, the old shares were still flat and weak except for Zhongxing.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Active Foreign Shares Stable</h3>
<p>Government bonds were encouraged yesterday by the news that pre-war deposits and court rulings still required repayment a thousand times over, and people were excited. Tongbing opened at 10,300 yuan in the morning, and from 10,200 yuan, it gradually rose to 11,400 yuan, and then closed slightly at the boundary of 11,000 yuan. Rooms 552, 555, and 503 bought in, while Rooms 230 and 360 sold out. As a result, it rose by 1,000 yuan compared with the previous attack, while the others rose by 500 yuan to 800 yuan, and the transaction volume was more than 5 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yisha British County Boiler was helped by the signing of the peace treaty with Japan and the hope of compensation, and it was shown to be excellent. The rest were just flat and weak. Security traders and money changers sold, while foreign merchants and Guohua Bank bought in. Yisha rose from 83,000 to 86,000 to close the market. Rubber shares have stabilized, and as a result, compared with the previous close, paper, fear of beer, and shipping were all flat, Huidefeng Yeguangji fell, and Yisha and British Union Steel both rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Narrow Fluctuations in Rayon Prices; Steady Factory-Operated Silk Goods Market</h3>
<p>Because the allocation of rayon has not yet been confirmed, the market remains firm. Yesterday, the opening price for No. 120 Takayama rayon was 24.78 million yuan, with the highest reaching 90 million yuan, fluctuating within a narrow range of only 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The final price in the afternoon was 4.8 million yuan. The sales of No. 150 Takayama rayon were slower, and the selling price was also lower. Yesterday, the transaction price for Jin San Ma brand rayon was 24 million yuan.</p>
<p>The factory-operated market was steady. Due to cost factors, holders were unwilling to sell at low prices. Yesterday, the asking price for C-grade Lan Fuhua rayon was 29 million yuan, and for E-grade, it was 28.5 million yuan, with only a few transactions. However, all payments were subject to five to seven-day terms. Separately, 28-branch raw silk was traded at 17 million yuan.</p>
<p>The silk goods market was stable yesterday. Dachang quilt cover closed at 20.4 million yuan for immediate delivery, with an additional 20,000 yuan for deferred delivery.

The market prices for other goods remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Spot Cotton Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was sluggish, with very few transactions and a weak trend. It was difficult for holders to unload their goods. Due to the sluggish sales of cotton yarn, the appetite of yarn mills was weak. Most businesses had more outflows than inflows, and the fatigue did not seem likely to improve in the short term, so transactions were difficult to facilitate. In the afternoon, the opening price for Bai Luo to be delivered from the warehouse was 2.06 million yuan, Bao was 2.1 million yuan, and Huoji was 1.72 million yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Slightly Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened weakly. Small-size cloth once fell to 421,000 yuan. Then, with the northern merchants slightly increasing their purchases of Wufu small-size cloth, local businesses also slightly absorbed the low prices. Moreover, because the Textile Construction Company's supply of cloth yesterday had few subscribers, the market supply became scarce, and prices became brisk. Finally, 12-pound Longtou small-size cloth rose to 432,500 yuan, an increase of 7,500 yuan compared to the previous day. Wufu Lan, Caiqiu, Yanghe and other small-size cloths also rose by 2,000 to 7,000 yuan. The white plain cloth market also showed some profit. There were many spot goods of Shilin cloth 190 Ji and Taohuagong, falling by 10,000 yuan. The colored cloth and blue cloth market were stable. [Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company, as usual, jointly allocated yarn on behalf of the Textile Association yesterday, totaling 677 bales, all allocated to manufacturers, with a total of 259 applications.</p>
<h3>Sparse Food Rice Transactions; Milled Rice Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 2,800 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market trend was that prices in the inland areas fell, causing public sentiment to be weak and transactions in the market to be sparse. Milled glutinous rice and indica rice gradually declined, falling by 10,000 yuan. However, Bai Yuan Yin Yuan rice was still firm due to scarcity. Over ten dan of new Pudong glutinous rice continued to arrive, divided into high and secondary grades, with prices unchanged. Xiang rice is currently in transit, and large quantities will be transported eastward from Hankou. Rice from Gan and Anhui is also arriving in Shanghai, and rice from Sichuan continues to flow. The situation for indica rice is temporarily less optimistic.</p>
<p>Flour dealers are still pessimistic. However, because raw materials are firm and expensive, factories are unwilling to sell easily due to cost factors, making it difficult for prices to fall sharply. Factory flour, mixed brand flour, and unified flour all fell slightly by over 1,000 yuan. However, imported flour is easy to sell and fragrant, rising by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran has not escaped its weak situation, falling by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake digestion is quite sluggish, falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Sesame is stable. There are few arrivals of red sorghum, and distilleries are actively buying, soaring by 10,000 yuan. Corn is readily accepted by alcohol factories, and inquiries from Beiyang are gradually increasing, continuing to skyrocket by 10,000 yuan. Broad beans are slightly purchased by merchants from other provinces, and local businesses are also buying. Zhejiang continues to move, increasing by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>There is little fluctuation in the oil market. Crude oil was initially weak and then firm, soybean oil was initially firm and then declined, with no gains or losses. Clear oil is temporarily stable. Vegetable oil is fluctuating. However, sesame oil is abundant and weak, falling by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Da Ying Company's Delaware ship sailed to England the day before yesterday, loaded with 845 tons of soybean oil to the Netherlands, 26 tons of pig bristles, and several cases of tea to London.</p>

As of yesterday, the total amount of new tea mortgages at the bank was 30 billion yuan, all of which will be purchased by the government and exported. As for the old tea mortgaged last year, only Qimen tea has been purchased by the Central Trust Bureau due to its maturity, while the rest are still in dispute due to pricing issues, so a decision has not yet been made.</p>
<p>Tea Market Lively. Since various internal sales tea have been continuously purchased by local stores and merchants from various provinces, the market remained lively yesterday. Among them, low-end black tea in the Wuxi area was particularly popular, making the process smoother. The opening prices all fluctuated within a stable range. It is expected that there is still hope for further progress in the future. As for the foreign tea market, the situation remains quiet, and the trend continues to be calm.</p>

Because the sellers did not order from the United States, and the buyers have no need. As a result, the local factory has not launched new products. Nowadays, more people wear plastic-coated Hong Kong shirts, resulting in the "sharkskin" sales being bleak, and are about to be eliminated.</p>
<p>Jinshan Twigs Weaken. Because Jinshan twigs continue to arrive recently, and the sales are sluggish, the price has weakened again. The market has fallen by another 100,000 yuan yesterday, and the production price may fall.</p>
<p>Lily bulbs are occasionally transported, resulting in an oversupply. The asking price has also continued to fall. The current market has entered the 800,000 yuan range, down by about one-third compared to the highest price. At 800,000 yuan, the profit is only meager, and the owners inevitably suffer losses.</p>
<p>Bank Communication Publication. The new 20th issue of the "Bank Communication" monthly magazine, which comprehensively covers economics and finance, was published yesterday, featuring works by Tan Bingwen, Zhang Baiyi, Yu Zengkang, Cai Zhihua, Lu Zhaohua, Zhu Youying, and others.</p>
<h3>The Seventh Regular Meeting of the Textile Adjustment Commission Decided to Implement Reasonable Price Negotiation</h3>
<p>Price Negotiation Group Handled the Matter</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The seventh regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Commission was held at the commission yesterday afternoon at 4 pm. Members Liu Gongyun, Shu Yuzhang, Wang Qiyu, Li Shengbo, Wu Weijing, Liu Guojun (represented by Rong Erren), Shi Fengxiang, Zhang Wenqian, Tang Xinghai, and Yuan Zhongda attended, chaired by Liu Siying. Many proposals were discussed. After a four-hour meeting, the meeting adjourned at 8 pm. According to Yuan Zhongyuan, the meeting concluded on two resolutions: (1) The Shanghai Nine Cotton Yarn Reproduction Industry Association's previous report stating: "Regulating production and sales should be listed as rules, and the current distribution policy still needs to be improved" was discussed and resolved: "Regulations should be listed," the principle was agreed to, but attention should be paid to the national nature, and detailed methods will be answered separately. (2) Regarding the price negotiation issue, members Wang Qiyu and Wu Weijing proposed: The price negotiation group should implement reasonable price negotiation at any time in a flexible manner, according to the principles previously set by the commission. The resolution was passed, and the implementation method was handed over to the Price Negotiation Subcommittee for review. (The Price Negotiation Subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 4 pm on the 2nd). In addition, it was heard that the issue of purchasing domestic cotton was also discussed. Regarding the proposed amendments to the Textile Adjustment Plan, private yarn mills have drafted separate opinions and submitted them directly to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the commission did not discuss them.</p>

<h3>Director of Qingdao Observatory Discusses Mysterious Flying Saucers with Our Reporter</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi, Qingdao Air Mail] Wang Huawen, Director of the Qingdao Observatory, uses a scientific viewpoint to explain the mystery of "flying saucers." The so-called scientific method emphasizes evidence and analysis. Therefore, Mr. Wang said that no matter what, the so-called "flying saucers" discovered everywhere include misidentified "weather balloons," but he does not affirm that all of them are mistakes involving balloons. Because, as of now, there is really no definite evidence to prove the existence of the so-called flying saucers.</p>
<p>This matter was spread from one person to ten, and from ten people to a hundred. After being published in newspapers, it became a worldwide sensation. It is like the story of "Zengzi Killing Someone," where even if you don't believe it, you have to believe it. But in fact, there is no such thing at all. I think it is very likely that it is entirely a misidentification of balloons.</p>
<p>As far as the reporter knows, radio weather balloons were first designed successfully by the Germans. They contain a barometer, thermometer, and hygrometer, each with a lead wire. When the three meters change, the lead wire triggers the attached electrical device, causing the oscillation frequency of the internal radio transmitter to change, which is received by a specially made receiver on the ground. It is not the general so-called transmitter. It transmits once every three or five minutes in rotation. The principle is simple, and the structure is also very easy. The report that a professor in Chengdu said it was dropped by an airplane seems to be incorrect. It is released from the ground to high altitude.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to find out the climate in Chongqing for bombing purposes, the Japanese often sent reconnaissance planes to release these instruments over Chongqing, still suspended by balloons, because the Japanese could not release them on the ground in Chongqing, so they used airplanes. Some were recovered by us. People were sent from the Military Affairs Department to study it. At that time, in general, little attention was paid to meteorology (even at the beginning of the war, weather forecasts were still made). After studying this box containing a "small light bulb," it was found to be a radio for meteorological reporting. We once wanted to imitate it. Everything was easy, even the vacuum tube as small as a finger was not difficult. The battery seemed to be a big problem. It was not easy for a dry battery as small as two mahjong tiles to emit 45 volts of electricity. This is a problem of Chinese industrial technology.</p>
<p>Most of the ones discovered in various parts of China now are released by Americans. Sino-American meteorology is a cooperative effort. The Sino-American Cooperation Organization included this part of the work in its anti-Japanese work. Such a box currently costs about ten to twenty US dollars. Chinese weather stations cannot afford to release them. If they don't release them, they don't release them, but if they want to release them, they must release them every day in order to obtain records. As for Shanghai and Chengdu, I can deeply believe that they are released by the US military. They do this work regularly. As for other places, they are mostly just balloons, as Mr. Wang Huawen said. Therefore, flying saucers are actually common, but they are not usually noticed.</p>
<p>(Above) The Qingdao Observatory was first compiled by Germans. This year marks the 50th anniversary. There are three major meteorological stations on the Chinese coast: Qingdao, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, but this station is presided over by Chinese people. (Below) The complete picture of a "flying saucer." The top is a balloon, and the bottom is a radio box, which houses meteorological, humidity, and pressure meters, as well as vacuum tubes and batteries, and other components.

<h3>Flying Saucer: Mysterious Monster or Weather Balloon?</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qingdao] Mr. Wang Huawen, Director of the Qingdao Observatory, at the request of our reporter, painstakingly wrote a manuscript detailing the shapes of flying saucers and weather balloons. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Recently, people on both the eastern and western shores of the Pacific, in both China and America, have successively discovered aerial monsters – flying saucers or flying discs. Because this event is rare, and because the power of the atomic bomb has just caused people to be startled, and US-Soviet relations are delicate, with tensions running high, the widespread rumors of this monster in the American sky easily cause people to connect it with the atomic bomb, neglecting its scientific exploration and focusing on its military consequences. At the same time, after the incident at Beita Mountain in our country, Soviet planes assisted the Mongolian army in the invasion, stirring up public outrage. The Sino-Soviet "Treaty of Friendship" is being re-evaluated in the hearts of the people. Within our country, from Hong Kong and Guangdong in the south to Shenyang in the north, from Xi'an in the west to Qingdao in the east, flying saucers have been successively discovered in the air, further fueling speculation and unease among the general public. Based on recent news reports about flying saucers from various sources, opinions differ, and there is no actual data available for research. I dare not make arbitrary judgments to determine their authenticity. However, from individual news reports, one can imagine that some observers describe what they see as unimaginable mysterious monsters—flying saucers or flying discs. But it is also possible that some are weather balloons released by meteorological observatories, mistaken by people. Although the use of weather balloons in meteorology is widespread, it seems that people in our country lack sufficient understanding of them. Here, I will briefly explain the general phenomena of weather balloons, so that in the future, when similar mysterious objects are discovered in the sky again, the observers can enhance their ability to distinguish.</p>
<p>There are many methods for high-altitude weather observation, including airplanes, kites, and balloons. Among balloons, there are manned balloons, tethered balloons, meteorological balloons, cloud-measuring balloons, wind-measuring balloons, and radio sounding balloons. We collectively call them weather balloons. Among these types of weather balloons, manned balloons and tethered balloons are now almost entirely abandoned. Moreover, these either have observers accompanying their ascent or are tethered by ropes at a fixed height, floating in space with limited movement, making it unlikely for them to be mistaken for flying saucers or flying discs. Those that are most likely to cause misunderstandings are the remaining types of weather balloons. Among them, meteorological balloons and radio sounding balloons are very large, with a diameter of about two or three meters on the ground. They carry instruments for measuring high-altitude temperature, humidity, and pressure, respectively. They can ascend to the stratosphere, which is over 17,000 meters high. As the altitude increases, the air becomes thinner, and the atmospheric pressure decreases, increasing the size of the balloon. Eventually, the balloon bursts and falls back to earth. Because they drift in the air with the wind, their paths are inconsistent. The speed of horizontal movement depends on the high-altitude wind speed. After the meteorological balloon bursts, the instruments it carries fall to the ground. The self-recording curves of temperature, humidity, and pressure in the instrument are examined to obtain high-altitude exploration records. However, meteorological balloons often land hundreds of miles away from the release site and sometimes fall into lakes, seas, or wilderness, making them difficult to retrieve. Therefore, radio sounding balloons are often used instead. The instrument carries specially made temperature, humidity, and pressure meteorological instruments that can automatically transmit the above three meteorological elements from high altitude via radio signals. The ground can directly receive or plot them into graphs, which is safe and fast. Therefore, radio sounding balloons are now mostly used to replace meteorological balloons. As for cloud-measuring and wind-measuring balloons, the former explores the height of the cloud base, and the latter measures high-altitude wind direction and speed. The balloon size is smaller, with a diameter of about one meter on the ground. After ascending, its orientation is observed using theodolites. Cloud-measuring balloons aim to explore the height of cloud layers, so they are released in cloudy weather. The height at which they are visible from the ground is limited by the height of the cloud base and is generally not very high. Wind-measuring balloons can be observed to altitudes of over 10,000 meters in theodolites. In clear weather, they can be seen with the naked eye, even at altitudes of 7,000 to 8,000 meters, if observed carefully. Although meteorological balloons, cloud-measuring balloons, wind-measuring balloons, and radio sounding balloons differ slightly in size and ascent altitude, they also have some common points that can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Color: Red, black, white, and silver-gray are the most common colors, depending on the color of the sky background to determine which to use. (2) Shape: Mostly spherical, but sometimes, due to uneven thickness of the balloon skin, the pressure is uneven after filling with hydrogen, resulting in an ellipsoidal shape. When viewed from the ground, only the cross-section is seen, resulting in a circular or elliptical shape. (3) Speed: The ascent speed is approximately from 100 to 300 meters per minute. Depending on the needs, it can be calculated from the weight of the balloon skin and the amount of hydrogen stored. The horizontal speed depends on the wind speed in the upper air. (4) Direction: The direction of the balloon depends on the high-altitude wind direction. Because high-altitude wind directions are variable, the direction of the balloon's movement is not only necessarily consistent with the ground wind direction, but also may not be the same at different altitude layers.</p>
<p>The above four are the common characteristics of weather balloons. What about flying saucers or flying discs? However, no one has directly obtained a flying saucer or flying disc to study it in detail. At most, one can only obtain some concepts from news reports. Based on the news materials obtained, the so-called flying saucers are:</p>
<p>(1) Color: White or silver-gray. (2) Shape: Circular, with a diameter ranging from four or five meters to twenty-five feet. (3) Speed: Some rise slowly, while others are as fast as shooting stars. (4) Direction: Some fly from northeast to southwest, while others fly southeast.</p>
<p>The above four points cannot be conclusively defined as the common characteristics of flying saucers or flying discs. Moreover, based on a single record, one cannot determine that the direction is always from northeast to southwest, or directly to the southeast, and the speed variation is too large. Those that are as fast as shooting stars can be definitely determined to be beyond the reach of weather balloons. However, in the case of those that rise slowly, even if their color, shape, speed, and direction are the same as weather balloons, it cannot be determined that those that conform to the above four common characteristics are weather balloons, just as "a horse is a four-legged animal, but not all four-legged animals are horses." Only when someone obtains this kind of flying saucer, with concrete evidence, can it be proven to be a meteorological exploration instrument.</p>
<p>Although the previously discovered flying saucers or flying discs may be a new and mysterious object, at the very least, at least some of them are weather balloons released by meteorological observatories, mistaken by people. Because the international situation is urgent, and people are mentally uneasy, it is easy to lead discerning people to discover miracles in space. Therefore, when the news of flying discs or flying saucers was rampant, when Professor Einstein stated that he had "no comments to make," the US Air Force searched the skies day and night. Their spirit of scientific exploration to get to the bottom of things is indeed admirable, but it can be asserted that their focus on exploring military effects far outweighs their interest in scientific research.</p>
<p>Currently, it is still impossible to determine what flying saucers or flying discs are, but it is not without reason that some of them may be mistaken for weather balloons. For example, according to the Ludong News Agency's Qingdao dispatch on the 18th, "An object similar to a flying saucer was discovered over the city (on the 18th) at 9:42 a.m., but it is impossible to provide more compelling evidence to prove that it was a flying saucer. When discovered, it was at an altitude of 2,000 feet, in the northwest direction, sometimes rising, sometimes falling. The object was round and luminous, flying from northwest to southeast. After about five or six minutes, it rose higher and flew away. The reporter was present at the time, and the general onlookers (about twenty people) discussed it, all wondering what it was." Although the author did not witness the object similar to the flying saucer at the time, after examining the Qingdao Observatory's weather balloon records for that day, the observatory released a balloon at 9:00 a.m. The balloon was milky white, rising at a speed of about 180 meters per minute. On that day, the wind at altitudes of 2,000 to 3,000 meters was from the northwest, with a very low speed of about seven or eight kilometers per hour. The balloon should have drifted from northwest to southeast with the wind. Therefore, the flying saucer discovered by Qingdao citizens seems to be related to the balloon released by the observatory on that day, in terms of time, altitude, shape, or direction of flight. However, we cannot determine that it must be a balloon and not a "flying saucer." This article only provides the above-mentioned points where balloons and so-called flying saucers or flying discs can be traced. As for what flying saucers or flying discs are, it remains to be observed further and analyzed before a determination can be made. In this autumn of knife-light sword shadows and bewildering international situations, the frequent appearance of flying saucers is indeed giving people considerable vigilance, fear, and unease, but careful examination and discernment are also needed for us to seek answers in calmness.

<p>Xikang [Special Dispatch] The central government has approved the quota of conscripts for this province this year as 2,700. It started in June and will be completed in three months. Because the population of this province is sparse, and it is divided into Kang, Luo, and Han ethnic groups, the Kang and Luo ethnic groups are temporarily difficult to conscript due to special circumstances, while the total Han population is about one million, and the number of men of conscription age (20 years old) is small. The provincial government has requested the Ministry of National Defense to consider reducing the quota appropriately and to postpone the conscription to September.</p>
<h3>A Tragicomic Legend: Zhang Xiuhong Sells Herself to Bury Her Mother-in-Law, Wang Binglin Redeems His Beloved Wife</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qingdao] Wang Binglin, who lives in the city of Jiaoxian, has a well-off family and both parents. He grew up with Zhang Xiuhong, a girl next door, and called each other brothers and sisters. After getting engaged, they became even more affectionate. On the eve of the "July 7th" Incident, Wang Binglin graduated from high school, and Zhang Xiuhong also finished junior high school. Wang Binglin and several classmates resolutely joined the army and went south with the army. Zhang Xiuhong, suppressing her sorrow, encouraged her husband to pursue his ambition and gave him a self-made exquisite handkerchief as a souvenir. Wang joined the military academy and soon went to war in the north and south. After the victory, he worked as a staff officer in a certain unit in Anhui Province. With no one to serve his elderly mother, his parents-in-law sent Xiuhong to Wang's house to serve her mother-in-law. Who knew that last year, the communists captured the city, and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law fled to Qingdao together, living with relatives at No. 250 Shenyang Road in this city, depleting their resources. Because her mother-in-law was old and frail and suffered from panic, coupled with her longing for her son, she became seriously ill. Zhang Xiuhong borrowed money everywhere, but the medicine was ineffective, and her mother-in-law finally passed away. Unable to afford a burial, Xiuhong sold herself to the Cuixin Troupe in Pingkang Second Lane (under the alias Xiaoxi) and used the money to bury her. After the former Jiaoxian was recovered, Wang Binglin asked for leave to go home to visit his family and learned that his family had fled to Qingdao. After searching everywhere without success, he visited the red-light district and saw Xiaoxi in the Cuixi Troupe. He did not dare to recognize her rashly. The next day, he brought money to the Cuixi Troupe to redeem his wife Xiaoxi (Zhang Xiuhong). Zhang knew that it was her husband and hugged him crying bitterly. Xiuhong, feeling that her purity had been tarnished, had no face to serve the gentleman again and wanted to die to thank him for his kindness. Wang, feeling her chastity and integrity, persuaded her with kind words and decided to live together to repay her kindness of burying her mother. It is reported that Wang will take his wife back to Anhui to resume his duties within days. (29th)</p>

<h3>The Seven Days and Nights of Bloodshed in Teng County</h3>
<p>Teng is a small country. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, should it serve Qi or Chu in diplomacy? Existing in the cracks between the two great powers, depending on others' moods and expressions, was really not an easy task. But no one could have expected that 2,500 to 600 years later, Teng County would become a key area for both sides in the military struggle for national resistance and suppression of rebellion. In the spring of the 27th year of the Republic, the Japanese army's Seishiro Itagaki and Renkai Isogai attacked Xuzhou from the north and south. Our 24th Army's Commander Wang Mingzhang of the Deng Xihou Department shed his blood in the isolated city and died in battle in Teng County, sacrificing himself for the national resistance.</p>
<p>On July 12th of this year, the Communist Army's East China Field Army, under the command of Chen Yi and Ye Jianying, invaded Teng County. After seven days of fierce fighting by our 20th Division Commander Yang Gancai of the 24th Army of the Organized Army, they were dealt a head-on blow. The former sacrificed his life, and the latter succeeded. Both were from the 24th Army, leaving behind a glorious record in the process of resisting Japan and suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<p>Teng County is located on the front line of the Jinpu Railway, on the south bank of Nanliangjiang, and faces Fengpei across Weishan Lake in the west. In order to realize the plan of "capturing Teng County to welcome the upcoming counter-offensive," the Communist Army, led by Ye Jianying's 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns, launched a two-pronged attack on Tai'an from Xintai and Laiwu, along the highway north of the Ru River and Wen River, before pointing west to Feicheng and Pingyin; another route was led by Liu Bocheng, leading the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns, crossing the river from northern Henan, attempting to encompass western Shandong and invade Jining from the east; Chen Yi personally commanded the main force of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 7th Columns, spying on Feixian, entering and leaving Yixian and Zaozhuang, vainly attempting to expand the Menglianggu encirclement operation against Zhang Lingfu's 74th Division, forcing Commander Li Yutang of our Xuyan Pacification District to fight on the inner line and annihilate it. Before the war began, Teng County was originally the seat of the Xuyan Pacification District Command. After the war began, the entire 20th Division took on the responsibility of defending Teng County.</p>
<p>Yang Gancai, the defending general of Teng County and commander of the 20th Division, was an old cadre of the Sichuan Army's 20th Army, who participated in the "1911 Revolution and the 1919 Resistance Against Britain." The initial leader of the 20th Army was General Yang Zihui (Sen), the current Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial Government. During the Anti-Japanese War, he supported Shanghai, guarded Anqing, and fought in Hunan and Hubei to block the enemy in Guizhou and Guangxi. After the First Battle of Changsha, Yang Sen was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the 27th Army Group, and Yang Jichao (Hanyu) succeeded as Army Commander. In the spring of the 34th year of the Republic, Yang Jichao and Ding Zhipan, the current Qingdao Garrison Commander, were successively promoted to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 27th Army Group, and Yang Gancai was promoted from Commander of the 134th Division and Deputy Commander of the 20th Army to Army Commander. After the Japanese surrendered, he was ordered to receive Guilin and Liuzhou and garrison Changsha. After being reorganized into the 20th Division last winter, he was transferred to southern Shandong. Division Commander Yang has a long face, high cheekbones, and a tall stature. He speaks pure Sichuan dialect, can write well, writes a good Diamond Sutra, and has a large capacity for alcohol. In terms of seniority, he is a clan nephew of Deputy Commander Yang Hanyu and a grand-nephew of Chairman Yang Sen. He is an outstanding young general in the "Yang Family Generals."</p>
<p>In this defense of Teng County, Division Commander Yang Gancai's entire 20th Division, with only a meager force of the 133rd and 134th Brigades, resisted the Communist Army's 40,000 to 50,000 troops, shedding blood for seven days and nights, killing and wounding nearly 20,000 Communist troops, creating a great victory comparable to General Chen Mingren's defense of Siping with the 71st Army. Originally, most of the soldiers of the 20th Division were robust men from Sichuan, who were always good at fighting mobile warfare in mountainous areas. This time, they were able to display the spirit of "defending with firmness" and fought a positional war to defend Teng County, shattering the Communist Army's dreams of cutting off Xuyan, encircling Xuzhou, and capturing Jinan, so that Lin Biao did not succeed in the Northeast, and Chen Yi was still frustrated in southern Shandong. Recently, although the Communist Army has the intention of rekindling the flames and staging a comeback to attack Teng County again, it is believed that with Commander Li Yutang of the Xuyan Pacification District and Commander of the 24th Army, relying on the command experience of the Third Great Victory of Changsha in the past and Deputy Army Commander Fang Xianjue's 47-day defense of Hengyang, coupled with the spirit of the 20th Division under Division Commander Yang Gancai, who fights ten battles and wins ten victories, the Communist Army flying moths into the fire is tantamount to self-destruction.

<h3>On Hypertension and its New Therapies</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Sometimes, our doctors truly feel helpless when facing hypertension. Why? Because current therapies are often "comparative" rather than "absolute." We might cure one hypertensive patient with a particular method, but it could be completely ineffective for others. Conversely, we might cure a certain type of hypertension with another treatment, but it may not be applicable to a different type. Such examples are endless. In short, hypertension treatment is currently more "comparative" than "absolute." We also have the experience that lowering excessively high blood pressure often makes patients feel worse, causing dizziness, fatigue, and chest tightness, which only subsides when their blood pressure returns to its original level. Many famous old doctors in Shanghai also have high blood pressure and have tried numerous methods to treat it, but ultimately they can only let it run its course.</p>
<p>Of course, we also know that there are many causes of hypertension. For example, people who overuse their brains or overexert themselves can develop hypertension. People with kidney atrophy can also develop it. Additionally, there are hereditary hypertension, syphilitic, lead poisoning, chronic alcohol and tobacco poisoning, diabetes, and obesity, all of which can lead to hypertension. Our treatment methods naturally vary depending on the cause. However, regardless of the cause, the "goal" of trying to lower blood pressure is ultimately the same. Moreover, the various troubles that arise when blood pressure decreases from a high level (such as dizziness, chest tightness, general fatigue, and weakness) are still enough to trouble us. (For example, a doctor told me: "A patient came to the hospital for hypertension that persisted for a long time without any adverse symptoms. One day, the patient suddenly complained of discomfort, dizziness, fatigue, weakness in the limbs, and pallor. The doctor thought it was caused by excessive blood pressure and measured it, but it was only around 100 degrees. After repeated measurements, it was confirmed to be accurate. The doctor was very surprised and questioned the patient, who confessed to secretly swallowing a small amount of alum (a type of folk remedy). The doctor forbade him from continuing to take alum and treated him with other methods, but the patient's physical strength never recovered, and he eventually died.")</p>
<p>Indeed, many hypertensive patients, after undergoing various treatments with no results, adopt a laissez-faire attitude, with drinkers continuing to drink and smokers continuing to smoke, content to live one day at a time, and not thinking about the possible terrible consequences of high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Of course, many relatives and friends will certainly worry about the patient, fearing the risk of a ruptured blood vessel. But, strangely enough, they may not suffer a stroke. They have had high blood pressure for many years, yet they are still healthy and lively. This is truly an unsolvable mystery!</p>
<p>In recent years, the medical field has made significant achievements in vitamin research. Since it is beyond the scope of this article, I will only briefly mention it. However, those pharmaceutical experts have now extracted a substance from tobacco leaves that is somewhat similar to vitamin P. Its name is Rutin. It is the flavone of Quercetin. It can be extracted in large quantities from the leaves and flowers of buckwheat. Its function is to prevent blood vessels from becoming brittle (making them less likely to rupture) and to restore the elasticity of blood vessels to normal. (See the medical biological experiment report of Dr. Couch, Dr. Griffith, and Dr. Lindauer in 1944). Proc. Soc. Exptl. Biol. Med. 55, 228 (1944).</p>
<p>Based on this report, they (such as Shanno, Bridel &amp; Beguin, etc.) have made continuous discoveries and progress in this area. Due to space constraints, I will have to omit it. However, we can all understand why many people with high blood pressure can continue to live safely without suffering a stroke. Because whether a blood vessel ruptures or not (i.e., whether a stroke occurs or not) seems to be related to high blood pressure on the surface, but in reality, it is not related at all. For example, a good car tire can be inflated to a high pressure of 45 or even 60 degrees and still be used normally without any problems. But if you use a tire that is already hard and brittle, it may rupture at any time when inflated to a pressure of 30 degrees. Therefore, whether a blood vessel ruptures or not is not a matter of the level of blood pressure, but a matter of the brittleness (fragility) of the blood vessel. In short, it is a matter of whether there is a lack of rutin in the blood vessel. If we have a sufficient amount of rutin in our bodies, then even if our blood pressure is high, there is no danger.</p>
<p>Good! Those of you who drink and smoke, you can reduce your worries from now on.</p>
<h3>Random Talks After Diagnosis (1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Jihua</p>
<p>(1) The Economic Problem of Medication</p>
<p>The country is so impoverished, yet the people are still extravagant and wasteful, unaware of the need to be frugal and self-reliant, and to think about saving in order to preserve the nation's vitality. Thinking about this is truly heartbreaking. Since the victory of the war of resistance, the number of luxury cars on the roads has increased day by day, and the market is filled with luxury and consumer goods, such as famous cigarettes, famous wines, and expensive radios and refrigerators, which are dazzling to the eye. The enjoyment of these many wealthy families has certainly consumed huge amounts of foreign exchange; however, the poor's style is also no weaker. Men and women have a cigarette after a meal, students watch movies every day and learn to dance, and some even gamble mahjong all night long, which is especially absurd. The social atmosphere is so depraved, and the government has no measures to guide or correct it. Everyone only seeks to enjoy the present and doesn't care about tomorrow. To talk about the country's construction and revival after the war is truly a sigh.</p>
<p>The above is a general description of the wastefulness of our compatriots, which the author is very worried about. Without further ado, let's get back to the main topic. Speaking of the use of medication in our medical field, there are also many wasteful and uneconomical situations, which require the cooperation of both doctors and patients to save our resources and preserve our country's vitality. Now, let's list the market prices of several so-called expensive medicines as follows, as our target for review:</p>
<p>1. Eugon, 4,500,000 yuan per box (10 ampoules)</p>
<p>2. Padutin, 1,600,000 yuan per box (5 ampoules)</p>
<p>3. Dolautin, 550,000 yuan per box (5 ampoules)</p>
<p>4. Optarson, 680,000 yuan per box</p>
<p>5. Tonophosphan, 1,400,000 yuan per box</p>
<p>6. Spesminchering, 450,000 yuan per box</p>
<p>7. German-made "Baonuyong" injection, 700,000 yuan per box (1 ampoule)</p>
<p>8. Concentrated "Baonuyong" injection (Progynon B Oleosum), 2,400,000 yuan per box (5 ampoules)</p>
<p>9. Schering Testoniron 10mg injection, 1,000,000 yuan per box (4 ampoules)</p>
<p>10. Schering Testoniron 25mg injection, 2,200,000 yuan per box (4 ampoules)</p>
<p>11. Calcium Ostelin "Glaxo", 400,000 yuan per bottle</p>
<p>12. Elbon tablets, 430,000 yuan per bottle (20 tablets)</p>
<p>13. Cossonol cough syrup, 120,000 yuan per 3 bottles (200cc)</p>
<p>14. Belladonna Neutralon, 460,000 yuan per box</p>
<p>Although the above medicines have considerable therapeutic effects, they are not life-saving magic drugs, nor are they unique medicines without similar substitutes. Therefore, it is simply irrational and wasteful to seek and purchase them at such high prices, creating opportunities for hoarding merchants to get rich. Although things are valued because they are rare, medicines are for treating diseases. They are not antiques and should not be sought after with an antique mentality to raise their value. If the price exceeds its deserved value, people will abandon it and not seek it. Can it raise its price on its own? If you go to the United States to observe or ask friends who have traveled to the United States, do people in that country seek out German-made or other scarce medicines at surprisingly high prices? They will definitely tell you that such foolish and wasteful behavior is extremely rare in the United States. Therefore, I believe that many unreasonable and ridiculed events in our country are caused by the shallow level of education, the lack of common sense among the people, the reluctance of highly educated people to teach their compatriots, and the arrogance of some compatriots who refuse to learn. Even regarding the waste of medication we are discussing now, I believe that the health bureau, doctors, and patients should all bear considerable responsibility, and hoarding merchants who raise prices should be punished. After I evaluate each of the above medicines and discuss how to replace them, I will explain why all three parties should be responsible.</p>
<h3>Sunlight and Health (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>"Sunlight, the source of life," is praised in the pens of poets, on the papers of writers, and even in the mouths of literati for its greatness and sanctity. It not only brings light to humanity, but also brings strength.</p>
<p>Sunlight is the root of life for all living things. Human survival is inextricably linked to it. Without sunlight, there would be no life in the world. We should understand something that is so related to our lives.</p>
<p>The relationship between sunlight and humans and their health can be described in several points:</p>
<p>First, the relationship to human material metabolism: Human material metabolism is enhanced by the influence of sunlight. The most important phenomenon is respiration. If we use a device to calculate the carbon dioxide exhaled from the lungs during respiration and measure the degree of other material metabolism, we will know that respiration increases significantly after the body is exposed to sunlight, and the amount of metabolic products such as urine and sweat also increases.</p>
<p>Second, the relationship to the physical development of children: Sunlight has an even greater relationship to the physical development of children. Children develop better in summer than in winter. Therefore, we see that children in tropical regions develop significantly faster than children in colder regions. This confirms that sunlight can promote physical development and growth. Also, some children who cannot walk have pale complexions because they are often kept indoors and lack sunlight. In industrial and foggy areas, urban children are prone to rickets, all due to lack of sunlight exposure.</p>
<p>Third, the relationship to the physical development of the general population: People who live in dark places, such as basements, cellars, and deep valleys, are prone to mental fatigue and have withered appearances. It is very different for those who often run in the sunlight. Because light is energy, when it shines on the human body, tissues can absorb the energy of light and convert it into heat. Therefore, part of the heat in the human body is obtained from light and becomes the kinetic energy for the body's work, such as blood production and metabolism, which are mostly promoted by sunlight energy. The most obvious example is that after the human body is exposed to sunlight, the tyrosine contained in the skin is oxidized and converted into melanin. Melanin is deposited in the middle of the epidermis and dermis and has the function of protecting the body. Because melanin can absorb ultraviolet rays and prevent ultraviolet rays from entering the deep layers and destroying tissue cells, it can also absorb ultraviolet rays and convert them into heat, sending it into the body and stimulating the functions of various tissues. Therefore, dark skin is a symbol of "healthy beauty," but excessive sun exposure causes melanin to lose its protective effect, and the skin can also become inflamed.</p>
<p>Fourth, the relationship to patients or the infirm: In today's medical treatment, the sunbathing used for patients or the infirm is a treatment method that uses sunlight to allow its vitality to reach deep into the inner layers. There are many benefits to regular sunbathing, such as after the human body is directly exposed to sunlight, the skin absorbs ultraviolet rays and can produce vitamin D. Therefore, sunlight has the effect of preventing rickets. Many countries often hold summer camping trips, the biggest purpose of which is to take a lot of sun baths.</p>
<p>Fifth, the relationship to nerves: People's nervous systems can also feel the stimulation of light, especially the eyes, which can mediate the phenomenon of light and cause special psychological reactions. For example, living in a room with red light makes people feel very happy and always like to run around, unwilling to sit still. Also, walking in a vegetable garden, with the vegetable flowers like a golden carpet, coupled with the warm spring sunshine, makes one feel refreshed and extremely happy. On the other hand, living in a house illuminated by green light for a long time gradually makes people feel unhappy, their spirits become calm, and their movements are suppressed. Also, if the room is carpeted with blue felt, it feels larger than its actual area and feels empty and cold. These are all effects of sunlight on the nervous system.</p>
<p>Sixth, the relationship to killing microorganisms: Sunlight has a great effect, which is to kill microorganisms. For example, pathogenic bacteria such as cholera and typhoid fever die within a few hours of direct sunlight exposure. Even the most resistant tubercle bacillus dies within a few hours of direct sunlight exposure. It has now been proven that sunlight can treat bone tuberculosis and tuberculosis of the skin, glands, or internal abdomen. However, if sunlight treatment is used for pulmonary tuberculosis, it should be under the guidance of a doctor, otherwise, it is often very dangerous. Furthermore, according to the experimental research of scholars, in high mountains and deserts, the time it takes for sunlight to kill bacteria is three or four times faster than in plains and cities, because the air in those places is thinner, there is more ultraviolet radiation, and it is dry and clean!</p>
<p>Seventh, the relationship to the land: The place where we live should be dry, not humid, to avoid inducing disease, because sunlight can dry the land, which is most hygienic. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Typhoid Treatment (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shou Wuqing</p>
<p>(6) Treatment of Intestinal Hemorrhage</p>
<p>Intestinal hemorrhage is an important complication of typhoid fever, and it is often seen in clinical practice. It is caused by ulceration of the intestinal wall, extending to deeper layers and invading the blood vessel walls. The amount of bleeding is directly related to the patient's safety. In addition to surgical operations and blood transfusions, as well as hemostatic injections, internal administration of hemostatic tablets, hypnotics, and tranquilizers should be used. At the same time, patients should be encouraged not to panic, to stay in bed and stop eating and moving for at least 48 hours. Unless specifically instructed by the doctor, give one or two teaspoons of liquid food every two hours, and then gradually increase the amount.</p>
<p>(7) Treatment of Intestinal Perforation</p>
<p>In high fever of typhoid, the abdomen often swells like a drum. If gas (farting) is not smooth, there is a risk of intestinal perforation. The degree of perforation varies, with one or several holes of different sizes. If the body temperature suddenly drops, the complexion changes suddenly, the pulse is rapid, thin, deep, and weak, and the breath is like a gossamer, and there is severe abdominal pain, the occurrence of this symptom should be suspected. There is a great danger to life. Small holes can also be naturally filled and healed. If there is no occurrence of enteritis, the outcome is better. For most holes, surgical suture should be performed according to the condition. Although the risk is greater, it is better than leaving it untreated and dying.</p>
<p>In short, typhoid fever is a disease that changes in thousands of ways and should be dealt with flexibly, only in the ingenuity of the doctor. How can dozens of words give a glimpse of the whole picture? However, being precise, concise, and succinct is like one corner of an encyclopedia. Taking one example and extrapolating to others, I hope readers will use it well.</p>
<p>Jun Qing's Note: Sulfaguanidine should be added to the treatment of typhoid fever, because the author has used this medicine for typhoid patients, and the results have been very effective. Although this medicine is a specific medicine for treating dysentery bacilli, its bactericidal effect on typhoid bacteria is also very great. (End)</p>

<h3>Saving the Declining Morale of Students</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>We are not "revivalists" who must sourly advocate some kind of formal "respect for teachers" or restore the kind of pedantic "blind obedience" relationship between teachers and students from the past.</p>
<p>We believe that the modern teacher-student relationship should be more democratic, more intimate, and more friendly, with mutual cooperation, mutual research, and mutual discussion for academic ideas. Only this kind of teacher-student relationship can help the growth of academic science.</p>
<p>While we oppose that kind of autocratic, library-like, masked teacher-student relationship, we are truly chilled by the rudeness and violence of today's students towards their teachers.</p>
<p>We are very indignant to read that Jin Chengyang, a student at Tsinghua University, failed the Monetary Banking exam and actually used violence against Professor Zhao Shouxin, stabbing Professor Zhao with a dagger.</p>
<p>We should consider this kind of violent action a disgrace to the sacred land of academia.</p>
<p>However, cultivating an excellent "academic atmosphere" is not something that can be achieved overnight. In those "violent" and "arrogant" atmospheres, have students ever regarded the school as a "sacred place" of academia? Have they ever regarded teachers as respectable mentors? They only see the school as a "stepping stone" for "advancement." Under this circumstance, it is only natural for teachers to be "punched" and "insulted."</p>
<p>However, this "violent" spirit of the students must be corrected. Otherwise, this is nothing short of an insult to the Chinese medical academic community, and for the entire academic atmosphere, it will cause endless harm.</p>
<p>The Tsinghua student stabbing the professor with a knife is not the "cause," but the "consequence" of the declining student morale.</p>

<h3>Aung San and the Burmese Independence Movement</h3>
<p>— Yifeng</p>
<p>Burma, on its way to striving for independence, suddenly experienced a bloody political assassination on July 19. The only young leader engaged in the Burmese independence movement, the current Deputy Prime Minister of the Burmese Provisional Government, Aung San, and seven of his cabinet members, unfortunately became the protagonists and victims of this assassination. This is naturally a very unfortunate sudden change in the process of the Burmese independence movement.</p>
<p>Aung San was born in 1914 and is only 32 years old this year. He received a completely British education. (Educated in Burma) In 1936, while still studying at Yangon University, he was enthusiastic about political activities. In that year, he was expelled by the school authorities for actively organizing student strikes. Since then, he has wholeheartedly strived to promote the independence movement of his motherland, so as to enable Burma to break away from British rule as soon as possible. Therefore, he gained power in politics very quickly and became the most intentional and outstanding figure in the political history of Burma in recent years.</p>
<p>In the early days of World War II, when Britain was losing in the West and had no time to look east, he had already emerged in Burma. During that period, he frequently maintained contact with Indian revolutionary leader Nehru and the leaders of the National Congress. At the same time, he also promoted contact between him and the Japanese, because at that time the Japanese were proclaiming that they would support the independence of the weak nations in the Far East. In 1942, Japan invaded Burma. Many Burmese who hated British rule expressed their willingness to cooperate with Japan, and Japan also nominally granted Burma independence. Aung San naturally stood on the side of cooperating with Japan at that time. He served as a minister in the Burmese government under Japanese protection and established the Burmese National Army. However, as he came into contact with Japan for a long time, he discovered that Japan's control of Burma was still completely imperialistic and had no sincerity in helping Burma achieve independence. He woke up, so he used his position as a cover to encourage the expansion of the resistance movement, making him the leader of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, a united resistance of all parties and strata in Burma, and the leader of the Burmese National Army. When Japan surrendered in 1945, the National Army he led worked closely with the British Indian Army and won the praise of Lord Mountbatten.</p>
<p>After the liberation of Burma, the British government announced that it would grant Burma dominion status, but did not specify a deadline for completing this step. He and the leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League believed that the White Paper did not meet their political aspirations, so they refused to cooperate with Thomes Smith's provisional government. By the autumn of 1946, it was proven that the White Paper policy had completely failed, so Sir Lans replaced Thomes Smith and obtained the cooperation of Aung San and his leadership alliance, integrating the Burmese national movement with the reconstruction work. Aung San then joined the Executive Council, serving as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense and Foreign Affairs. The Alliance also became the only majority party in the Executive Council. The resolution of the Executive Council in November of last year demanded that British forces quickly withdraw from Burma, with economic and military measures being taken in tandem, strongly expressing Aung San's political will. At the same time, in order to adhere to the middle political line, he expelled the Burmese Communist Party from the alliance at the same meeting. At that time, he certainly obtained British Prime Minister Attlee's deeper understanding of the future of Burma's independence and issued a promise allowing the Burmese to freely decide their own future destiny. However, on the other hand, it aroused the jealousy of the old Burmese political parties. They formed the National Democratic United Front, standing in opposition to his alliance. The leader of this front is precisely the former Prime Minister U Su, who is now arrested as a suspect in the assassination case.</p>
<p>Therefore, the internal cause of Aung San's assassination is considered by British observers to be the fundamental conflict between the extreme left-wing anti-fascist alliance's political views and the opposition's jealousy, which is very likely. Naturally, Aung San's death is a great loss in the path of Burma's struggle for independence. The mourning and glory of his death can also show the Burmese people's respect and love for him. In particular, Attlee's statement that the British government will not change its established policy of allowing Burma to be independent due to the assassination proves that Aung San's efforts were not in vain.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spies</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhengming</p>
<p>A former operative of the Japanese spy network recently told this author that the vast network of the Japanese Communist Party in the occupied areas of China and Northeast China had been collecting important intelligence for the Chinese Communist Party until 1942 when it ceased operations.</p>
<p>This former Japanese spy operative had lived in Shanghai and the Northeast for many years, and since the end of the war, has written several very famous books about China. He was elected to the Japanese House of Councillors as a member of the Japanese Communist Party in April.</p>
<p>In early 1942, most of the Japanese Communist Party spies were discovered and arrested. Therefore, the various espionage activities carried out for the Chinese Communist Party were greatly reduced from that time onwards.</p>
<p>The spy group to which this spy operative belonged was composed of about thirty Japanese Communist Party members within the South Manchuria Railway Research Bureau. This South Manchuria Railway Research Bureau employed approximately one thousand staff and had representatives stationed in major cities in occupied China to collect economic data. These thirty Japanese Communist Party members formed their own organization within the Research Bureau because they could utilize almost all of the bureau's research work to provide intelligence to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>He himself was stationed in Shanghai, serving as an advisor to three major Japanese organizations, one of which was a secret espionage organization. He managed to transfer valuable intelligence regarding Japan's economic, political, and military plans in China to the New Fourth Army.</p>
<p>Later, this Japanese Communist Party spy group in China was discovered as an indirect result of a famous spy case that was broken. One of the personnel in that famous spy case was once a secretary to Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe and also a secretary to the Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany. He was arrested on October 15, 1941, at which time the Japanese secret police discovered that they were all key figures in a spy center directed by the Comintern. They were all executed in prison.</p>
<p>Of the one hundred people arrested, twenty were executed. Five others died in prison; the rest were released after the war. Two people, including himself, were sentenced to life imprisonment in September 1945, after the end of the war, due to "forced confessions" and repeated extensions of the interrogation period. Therefore, they were all freed a few days later.</p>
<p>Now, he and other Japanese Communist Party spies who once risked their lives to help the Chinese Communist Party forces are engaged in writing and publishing articles about China and other less dangerous professions. (Translated from the original by Hugh Deane)</p>

<h3>Miscellany from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>The Writers' Association of America</p>
<p>Every major city in the United States has organizations similar in nature to the Writers' Association, differing only in name, and slightly varying in their operations. Some are called Writers' Clubs, others Scribblers' Clubs, some are purely literary, others have a bit of a commercial bent. Purely literary writers' associations hold tea parties or dinners once or twice a week. Tea parties are held at members' homes, dinners at restaurants, and expenses are shared by the participants, paying on the spot. From a Chinese perspective, this seems quite stingy, because a tea party for thirty or forty people costs only ten-odd US dollars, requiring each person to chip in three or four dimes. In fact, it's a completely democratic approach, where everyone is a host. At tea parties or dinners, there are several items on the agenda, such as introducing new members, guest speeches, reading papers or poems. These papers are lengthy and tedious; good works have already been snatched up by publishing houses and published, not waiting to be read at the writers' association. Poetry is more relaxed, and is often bought by music publishing companies. Female writers like to print their proudest poems on New Year's cards and distribute them to relatives and friends, using it as self-promotion. Writers' associations also introduce members' works to small publishers for publication, and short stories to local newspapers for publication, but the fees are extremely limited. A female writer in Denver published four books through a publisher, receiving a fee of three hundred dollars for each, which, calculated at the black market exchange rate, is more than 12 million legal currency, enough to make Chinese writers stick out their tongues in amazement, but three hundred US dollars for a book is truly miserable in the United States. The American publishing industry has a big problem: it doesn't nurture the unknown, it only promotes established writers. Americans read books not for the content, but only for the author's reputation. Works like those of Mr. Lin Yutang and Emily Hahn will spread like wildfire in the United States, fully demonstrating Americans' "hero-worshipping" sentiment and herd mentality when reading. Famous writers do not join writers' associations, but those who join writers' associations are those whose works have no way out and want to use the meager influence of the writers' association to promote immature works. As a result, works sent to the writers' association are like stones sinking into the sea, and only after a year or six months are they published in newspapers in remote areas, truly making the writer laugh and cry.

<h3>Lingzhi (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jia Zuzhang</p>
<p>Now, emperors are long gone, and lingzhi is no longer offered as tribute. But history is a heavy burden for humanity, and the traditional superstition about lingzhi from over two thousand years ago still lies dormant in the depths of people's hearts, ready to stir. This year, especially, is a year when lingzhi is repeating its fate. In February, someone held a lingzhi charity exhibition to help students, and now there is another lingzhi charity exhibition to support education. However, I heard that the previous charity exhibition to help students did not have very good results. The reason for this is not difficult to guess because lingzhi was originally a treasure that the common people offered to the emperor, and the emperor had the right to demand contributions from the common people unconditionally. By extension, all wealthy and powerful people have the right to exploit those less fortunate than themselves as much as possible. Now, to go against this and make the wealthy pluck one or two hairs to help poor students is like seeking skins from a tiger. It is inevitable that good results will not be obtained, and what is the purpose of studying anyway? Now, in order to study, we are actually going to restore ancient superstitions, which is nothing more than pursuing the end and not choosing the means.</p>
<p>Although we know that it is always good to compliment others, "I love my teacher, but I love truth even more." Revealing the truth of the facts and reducing the elements of superstition is ultimately more important than merely flattering. The era of lingzhi's "spirituality" has passed, let it return to its original face. Lingzhi belongs to a type of fungus in the Polyporaceae family. The characteristics of this family are: fruiting bodies are membranous, leathery, corky, or fleshy, with or without stalks. The hymenium grows on the inner surface of the hymenial tubes under the fruiting body. The tubes are reticulately connected wrinkles or honeycomb-like pores, and a few are composed of ring-shaped lamellae. One lingzhi is one fruiting body. When it first emerges, it is slender like a pen, then the lower part becomes the stipe, and the upper part expands into a fan-shaped pileus. Like shiitake mushrooms, the stipe is attached to the center of the circular pileus, while lingzhi is attached to one side. The upper surface of the pileus is brown or reddish-brown, with concentric ring patterns; the lower surface is light yellow or white; the stipe is brown and shiny. The texture is hard, and it can be preserved for a long time when dried. The color can have variations in shade, with purple being the most common, so it is called purple lingzhi, which is a true description. Red lingzhi has also had scientific records, black lingzhi probably refers to those with particularly dark colors; white lingzhi and yellow lingzhi are probably due to the particularly prominent color of the lower surface of the pileus; green lingzhi seems to be impossible, or perhaps close to black!</p>
<p>The old records of the morphology of lingzhi, Wei Xi of the Three Kingdoms period, had a eulogy of divine lingzhi, which was meticulous, clear, and in accordance with the spirit of science: "In the first year of Qinglong (233 AD), divine lingzhi was produced in Xiyang of Changping. Its color was reddish-purple, its texture was radiant, its length was one foot eight inches and five points, the circumference of its base was three inches and three points, the upper part was divided into three trunks, divided into nine branches, scattered into twenty-six stems, and the circumference was one inch and nine points. The leaf diameter was two inches and seven points. The trunks were connected and interwoven, resembling the shape of coral. Its protruding twigs carried leaves, auspiciously bright and clean. Examining the patterns and documents, it is indeed more beautiful than what was heard in the past." But the stipe of this lingzhi is branched, which is what is called joined-stalk lingzhi. This is probably an accidental bifurcation of the stipe, or several lingzhi growing in the same place, and the stipes fuse together.</p>
<p>In addition to the teratoma of the stipe branching, there is also one stalk that simultaneously produces several pilei, as recorded in the History of the Song Dynasty: "In May of the sixth year of Xianping, Pan Ju, a resident of Daojiang County, grew lingzhi in three layers, yellow-purple in color, and about five inches in height."</p>
<p>Lingzhi parasitizes on the parts of trees close to the ground, such as plum, peach, fir, and bamboo. First, white hyphae spread under the bark, and then fruiting bodies sprout outward from the hyphae. The ancients did not observe the hyphae, so they said it "grows without roots" and thought it was very magical.</p>
<p>Now, on the stalls of itinerant medicine men and in the display windows of antique shops, we can see lingzhi. The uses of lingzhi are actually limited to these.</p>
