<h3>我建議限制否決權　旨在避免造成僵局　京各方注視我國獨立外交</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕外部發言人，三日午後就我國在連大正式提出對安理會五國持使否決權須加程序上限制之建議一事，告本報記者　：「我國此一行動，旨在打開過去因否決權濫用而造成之僵局，然並非我國意欲放棄否決權之謂。此點至為重要，而應為全國與論及民衆所正確了解者」。記者按，我國代表　此種措施，與對日和約之採獨立立塲，同爲王外長一行出國前所決定者，原擬對否決權使用之限制為積極規定，僅可用於涉及一國主權及重大利益時，今建議採消極規定；比較之下，更見　體而易行。外部方面不願推測是項建議將遭何國贊成或反對　但認爲此係根據經騐與常理而擬定之有益世界和平及國際合作之工具，可助聯合國解決目前正糾結不開之難題。京中各方三日僅自報端獲悉此事之梗槪，雖無甚强之反應，然均注視我國此一重要而獨立之外交行動。　我國建議案見二版第三欄）</p>

<h3>俞飛鵬報告糧政　並坦白說明舞弊案件</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京三日電〕糧食部長兪飛鵬三日出席參政會駐委會，報吿卅六年度施政情形，略爲三點：　軍糧之籌　，公糧及民食之供應，　糧部各項業務應改進處糧四平　担，加準備量一成合四千四百萬祖。唯今年揚子江一帶收成雖好，亦得以八折計，故實征糧八折計，以三千六百萬擔加一成三千九百六十萬担爲準，此爲軍糧。其次關京滬公糧及一部份民食，約計如次：滬每月發米廿二萬包，麵粉一萬噸，京每月米五萬餘祖，麵粉六萬餘月底止，由中國農民銀行購置完畢，餘為　　，需一千萬祖，第一期五百萬担，亦由農行代購輸次之，儲藏部份尤應注意　　案。未俞部長並坦白報告該部所屬機構工作人員之舞弊案件，自本年一月至九月止，共經檢討統計合共五百　八件。</p>

<p>停頓已久之中韓貿易，政府循旅韓　僑的請求，正考慮恢復，並決定貿易開放原則，由行政院代電僑務委員會，轉知旅韓各僑團遵照。監察院一部份委員，爲了杜絕變相中日貿易的危機，於九月廿九日建議政府，主張中韓貿易開放，主管各部門事前應詳愼改訂辦法，事後應嚴予管制，一方注意彼此僑求，一方認明物資原始產地及最後銷地，俾得杜漸防微。監察委員基於審愼心理，懼中韓貿易恢復爲中日貿易開放的變相：實則中日貿易一事，中韓貿易又爲一事。我們對中日貿易的開放，並不持完全贊同的態度，但對中韓貿易的恢復，我們站在維護僑民利益的立塲，郤認目前有此必要。</p>
<p>中韓本爲兄弟之邦，兩國壤地相接，人民生活習慣亦複多少相同，故在經濟上相需相助之關係，極爲密切。在戰前，我旅韓僑商約三十萬人，商店約五千餘戶，連同依此爲生的眷屬，不下百萬人。在戰時，中韓正常經濟中斷，整個韓國市塲爲日本所獨占，僑商以貿易停滯，莫不坐吃山空，陷於垂危之境。在戰後，韓國南北爲美蘇分據，行使各不相同的統制政策。韓南方面，韓人迫切需要中國物資，　經美軍政府提出通商要求，我政府初則堅持須結美匯，致過渡辦法未爲美方接受。繼則仿照中日易貨辦法，指定由中央信託局主持，去年十一月廿一日，行政院並通令海關，以中韓貿易正與麥帥總部會商，在未經商定辦法以前，所有申請運韓船貨，一律禁止出口，這種積極限制的結果，中信局以中韓貿易瑣碎無利，從未着手進行；而海關則藉口禁令，將所有由韓返國之船貨，一律査扣，使無以爲生之旅韓僑胞，變賣產業，易爲船貨，不顧海上風險，冒九死一生返回本國，均被査扣充公，而無從告訴，這是政府嚴格管制，對僑商的重大損害。韓北方面，蘇軍將韓人及我僑胞對外關係，完全對鎖，惟有山東，遼寗，安東共黨佔領區域，竭力鼓勵僑商赴韓易貨，幷換取人　海產轉運我區套取法幣。在此遷延不決，泄泄沓沓情形之下，政府旣無以對受害的僑胞，且無形驅使僑商走上資共的一條途徑。此　失策，對中韓兩　有百害無一利，對數十萬僑胞猶為不利。</p>
<p>韓國在戰前，為日本獨占殖民地，經濟上為日本之附庸。在戰後，韓國在形勢上雖宋獨立，南北未統一，然韓國人民意志是獨立的，精神是統一的。在經濟上，韓國早已解除日本的　　，分別為美蘇商品市場。韓人殷切盼望中韓貿易的恢復，我旅韓僑胞更以中韓貿易開放，為其生存所繫，多方呼號，希望政府對此問題，有明確的認識，重新考慮。今年三月，國民黨三中全會開會，中委范予遂等提請恢復中韓貿易，並陳說利害，決議送政府辦理。中韓貿易協會理事長周愼九等，去年十一月十二月及本年四月問，迭次呈請政府，發除對韓貿易之禁令，並提出在韓國正式政府未成立前，中韓臨時通商辦法原則，早日恢復正常關係。行政院循僑商請求，衡明利害，近決定了下列三項原則：　中韓貿易確有考慮開放必要，應卽由外交部於短期內，先探明美韓雙方態度與政策，再訂通航貿易之詳細辦法：　凡屬已扣之韓國華僑貨物，屬於暫停輸入項下者，一律補稅放行：　在中韓貿易未正式開放前久今後旅韓華僑繼　申請進口物品，除禁止進口者外，　律准予報關納稅放行，出口者暫緩辦理。根據這三項原則看來，政府是準許中韓貿易局部的恢復，並非全部的恢復；去年十一月禁止僑商船出口令，　部份的修正，並非禁令的放棄。如照此原則而行的中韓貿易，是准有限制的進口，無條　的不　出口。這是貿易政策的關而不閉，距離僑商的要求，中韓易貨的貿易，仍有懸殊。在這情形之下，如再嚴格管制，所謂中韓貿易恢復，祗是處有其名而無其實，更何從談到中韓經濟關係的建立？</p>
<p>中是貿易開放，理論與事實，都有問題。中韓貿易恢復，似不能與之相提並論，混爲一談。我們贊同旅韓僑商的請求：一·廢除對韓進出口禁令，凡經中韓貿易協會證明之僑商申請對韓輸出或輸入而遵守關章，手續完備者，一律准予放行，以開僑商生路；二·依據歷年中韓貿易紀錄，參照現行進出口貿易辦法，另定對韓許可進出口之貨品種類，以合需要。輸入如人　海產等，似可準許進口，粗製夏布　蓆大椒等，似　准許出口，彼此交換，各蒙其利。</p>
<p>現在韓人殷切盼望中韓貿易的開放，數十萬旅韓僑民處境更垂危，爲了加强中韓經濟關係，爲了救濟僑民，維護僑民利益，恢復中韓貿易，實爲當前必要之　！</p>

<h3>宋子文談話</h3>
<p>宋子文在接交典禮中致詞稱：自北伐離粤迄今已廿戰。此次重返鄕梓服務，極感愉快。今後施政方針，在加强水災善後，維護治安，恢復交通。同時並加强地方自衛力量，絕對不容匪徒再肆蔓延。史治方面，務求樹立廉潔風氣。此次返粵，各方對粤省農工建設均寄予極大期望，故切　地方人士共同襄助，對政治上興革意見，皆望坦率提出，無不　心接　。最後並稱　務使短期內粤省同胞皆得安居樂業。典禮　五十分鐘即吿成，是日中山紀念堂內外皆無任何舖張　亦未燃放　炮，省府門前僅有白紙布吿，不用紅紙　此或爲掃除官僚作風表現。宋氏未帶一人來粤，請秘　處各科長一律留任。下午五時，宋氏在省府會　室舉行就任後首次記者招待會，空氣輕松而和論。宋氏答復記者各項問題稱：　省府人事渠不在京，滬決定，而係欲在地方上物色賢能，然後推　中央任用。　治安與交通恢復，爲當前急務，否則無從談經濟建設。　前羅主席訂下之五年建設計劃，待渠詐細研究，始能發表意見。　海南島改省問題、渠無成見，擬改日與同鄉未硏究此事。至開發海南島，實爲一重要課題，中央亦早有具體辦法。　民·靑兩黨參加地方政府消息，渠紙從　章上看到，餘無所知。　此次回粵發覺粵省經濟危機較前　　軍，要打破難關，恐仍須若十時日，渠當盡力以赴，同時，亦盼全省民衆多于協助。</p>
<h3>董顯光談話內容</h3>
<p>當　光屬長談話如下：「余日前在記者招待會中所指出民盟與共匪勾結之情形，僅略舉其例證，當然皆有事賞之根據，如：子，比重遁詞自不　為任何人所信任，蓋國氏加入民盟，違在民主政團同盟時代，以東北救亡總會代表人之資格，與周　文同時盟巾央常委，羅氏旣已承認，而周氏之出任東北共匪偽組織之行政委員，係匪方正式公佈，爲不容否記之事實，詳情可參閱去年九月十二日上海文匯報，如颶不確，則民盟早應否認，何必等待一今日？至周鯨文現在是否仍在東北，抑往來滬港為匪方奔走聯絡，固與所擔任之植物無關。政府曾在東北補獲所謂一東北人民自治委會」主要份子駱責基，幷査出籌組「東北人民自台政府一之陰謀文件。駱自供係受周鯨文之指使，在東北活動。余日前所舉民盟首要份子在匪方任職之例有七人之多，而羅隆基只能否認其一，餘則啞口無言，實欲蓋彌彰</p>
<h3>民開與匪沆一氣</h3>
<p>羅隆基承認民盟在匪區中有組織，民盟盟員亦有在匪　中擔任職務者。夫匪區中人民無絲毫之自由可言，其不容共黨及其附　以外之任何個人與政治組織存在，此爲舉世所熟知之常識。民　如非與共匪有特殊勾結，沆　一氣，則余實不知民盟份子何以能在匪區中生存也。至羅氏所云民盟份子之在匪方任職者均在戡亂動員令發表之前，然則這員令旣下之後，旣未聞此等民盟份子脫離匪方工作，亦未見民盟總部宣佈除名，而羅·黃二氏皆承認「任何政黨活動無不以其中央機關所　訂綱要爲依據」，則民盟自難逃避其參加匪方叛亂組織之責任，此理甚明也。</p>
<h3>所謂中立徒托空言</h3>
<p>所謂中立徒托空言　羅薩基·黃炎培二氏均曾言及民盟南方總支部公開號召，以行動對抗政府戡亂總動員一事，據稱民盟總部曾依據民盟中央釐訂之綱要，去電指示，應以民盟主席張表方先生書面談話爲民盟之立塲，彼所指張表方之談話，乃對於政府戡亂動員令表示其不滿，未足以表明超然中立之立塲，而此種空洞無物之一篇牢騷，余誠不解其何足以　民盟南方支部陰謀組織軍隊策動反叛之實際行動。又如黃炎培氏所言民盟不帮助共產黨來打國民黨，則參加東北匪方偽組織中民盟份子如此之衆，其非帮助共匪來打政府，孰能信之？</p>
<h3>此後申辯不再答覆</h3>
<p>民盟自參加政協以來，無獨立之政治主張；有之，唯追　共黨亦步亦趨，爲世人所共見。是　著的，在國大開會之前夕，民盟曾有一次參加第三方面提出比較中立性的和平建議，但羅陸基經周恩來　斥之後，立即撤回。比及共黨代表自京滬撤退，民盟不僅承繼中共這下之產業，且中共之地下工作所付託於民盟者，亦殊爲明顯。政府對於民盟鼓動各地學潮種種陰謀，更獲有確切證據。總之，此事已非文亭　論之問題，而爲一事實問　　本人對於羅氏此後之辟論，不擬再作費辭，而將於必要時公布專實，作爲答覆」。</p>
<h3>限制使用否決權　我國建議案內容</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖二日電〕聯大我代表團頃正式提出草案，建筑對安理會五强否決權之使用，加以程序上之限制，我國建議案，本日已列爲大會正式文件，並分發各代表團參閱。其中雖橫　　盡，力求避免修改憲軍中規定之安理會表決規則，而所列主張乃安理會握有否決櫂之五常任理事國迄今所提出建議中最屬深選者。我建議案計分三部：　建議安理會確定若干種類之決議係屬於程序事項，按照憲章不能使用否決權。　籲請五强對和平方法解決紛爭之事項，放棄使用否決權。　　請大會宣布單一國家之否決權，不能取消安理會會員對憲章之義務，並建議安理會多數國家，得就　行此種　務進行　商，或則於單　國家否決權阻礙安理會之行動時，行使其召集大會特別會議之　利。我國建議，料將遭蘇聯之反對，因蘇聯堅決拒絕考　「們權而變更」安理會否決權，其餘三强代表團，則至今未加正式評論。據可靠人士表示，美國代表團或將主張中國建議交特別委員會硏究，並於明年大會中提出報吿。其他非官方之評語，則認爲我國建議籌可能使否決權問題中二大極端意見取得協調，並謀致解決（按極端意見之一，即召集特別大會修改憲章廢除否決權）。我國建議案，最近期內不致討論，蓋否決權間題現交由政治安全小組委員會處理，該會積案甚多，有關否決權各節，均置於議程之末端。</p>
<h3>擴大地方民意機構　參駐會提改善辦法　反對由政府遴選參護員</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕國務會義通過民，靑兩黨選選參議員參加地方民意機稱案後，滬市參議會提出異議於前京市參會復響應於後。國民參政會駐委會三日開會，　前·余楠秋·尹述　·王普涵·伍純武·薛明劍·林忠·金維繫·李洽九參政員特提出一案。「請政府改善擴大地方參議會辦法案」，經討論後，一致認爲極爲黨要，當決議：「送請政府切實注意」，該案略如次：「各省市地方民意機稱，除現尙爲臨時參　會外，多已成立民選之參議會。此中參議員之產生，初未注意其有無黨籍，今以民靑兩黨之要求，國府　然允許用　選方式，使兩黨人士參加，此不思之甚者也，如政府歧視「有黨籍之國民」與「無黨籍之國民」，則所謂民言者限於有黨籍之國民矣。目前各地方民意機稱旣係人民直接選舉之議員組織而成，如中途插入遴選議員，不啻政府破壞參議會參議員在產生區有罷免權遴選人員，誰罷免之？，實貽民主政治之笑柄，擬請政府另訂妥善辦法」云云。</p>

<h3>工程師年會</h3>
<p>今晨之專題討論，以範圍過大，為使討論集中，分成七點，逐一討論。首先提出者爲：「在現狀下，工業建設着手之重點何在？又應茹何與農業建設配合，使能及時挽救社會經濟之危機？」楊　會，夏光宇，徐恩曾等發言，强調工業建設應與農業建設保持密切連擊，而其軍點，則應着重動力水利等，並指出，日本賠償我國之機器，應合理分配全國各地，並　將其視作我復興工業之生命綫。來自邊地之會員，希望從事農工建設時，勿將　地置之不　，渠等鄭車指出，邊　多事，原因　多，然我在各該地點毫無建設，使邊人因　往他國文化而發生離心力，實其生因。更有主張不　放葉YVA計劃者。</p>
<p>繼討論當前金融界對工礦貸款，藉詞防止通貨膨脹，採取收縮政策之不合理問題。徐恩會等贊成經濟改革方案所建議之一定貨方式」，即由國家貸款予工　，而收回其成品，如是一方面扶梅工業，一方面又可使貸款不致流入非生產之路。沈怡指出目前徑濟已臨最嚴重關頭，當局對於有利社會並足以挽回經濟危機之貸款，即使因貸款可能加深通貨膨脹，亦應予以貸放。沈氏認目前建設應以解決失業爲唯一　的，務使無業者有業，有業者樂業。此一現爲南京市長之工程專家並現身稅法稱：「靑年進銜門謀出路，爲時代之悲哀。」顧毓　提出四點：　經濟危機之挽救，不應探用補救方法，而應自改革入手。　經濟看法應以物資爲中心，而不應以法幣作衡量標準。　經濟據點即軍　據點，軍事當局對於經濟據點應加重視。　生產以配合方式生產，消費以記合方式消費。夏光宇更强調交通在經濟及國防上之重要性，盼當局同揚重視。</p>
<p>關於工業建設應否先擇定一二較爲安全地位，集全力發展，再及其他區域，抑即作　　發展一問題，會中意見顯成兩派。主張擇安全地區發展者，舉原子彈破壞力强烈爲例。反對者則以爲工業建設有其原料，交通·銷路等種種必備條件，不可過於重視安全，而影響生產。</p>
<p>後討論如何吸收游資僑資，從事生產事業，與如何利用外資問題。關於　勵海資投資於工　建設　　一點，僉認資金　趨囤　居奇，與時局不靖，政府對工業無一定政策，工業所　保障等咸有關係，凡此皆　設法予以彌　。夏光宇並建議於各區設立區的設計機　，協助全國經濟委會工作。華文　動打字機發明人爲仲斤，以其在美國經號，對利用外資及　外國技　合作事提出三點：　利用外國之高速度機械技術，有經濟價　。　美國爲世界　件　工廠。　國家應集中購實力於國內市場。高氏登台時，全塲報以熱烈　　，會　至十二時半始散。</p>
<p>首都建設討論</p>
<p>下午二時　作專題討論，由沈怡主持，題爲「促成首都建設之基本條件」，沈氏首擬定要點七項，並就「過去首都建設未能順利展開之原因何在」一點發表意見，沈氏稱：本市自民十六年奠都設市後，十八年成立首都建設委會，至今已屆二十年，其建設未能如理想之迅速展開，檢討其原因，大別有三：　一般性的，爲　都以來國內軍事之頻仍，及最近國內政治　濟之影　。　技　性的，如都市計劃之迄未完成，建設程序之迄未　定，使整個建設之　行無所依據，而　於治標。　政治性的，爲建設經費迄無着落，機構　　宋能專一，以及一般行政手　之　　重疊，使首都建設進行於各方夾總之中，難有鉅大之成就。繼由趙祖康，盧于正等發言，並推定譚炳訓等五人負資賽査，由沈怡召築。</p>
<p>〔又電〕工程　　曾各富門工程　會，除市政衛生兩專門學會之論文廿一六篇，於四日下午二時宣　外，餘均在三日下午舉行　由吳承洛總主持，各組另推定負資人，擔任主席，論文計　通工程學會四篇，土木工程學會廿二篇，水利工程學會八篇，建築工程學會一篇，機械工程學會九篇，電機工程學會十篇，航空工程學會八篇，鑛治工程學會七篇，紡　工程學會三篇，各專門學會　文宣　完畢，即將分別　　最優者　　篇，其撰寫人與論題，將於四日大會宣佈。</p>
<p>三晶下午八時工程演講，顧毓縣主持，由陳中　，許本純，吳學　分別講演東北之電業礦業與鋼　機械業，高仲芹會員演講電動華文打字機之設計及應用。</p>
<p>四日為第三日，上午仍爲專題高論，由　鴻勛主持，題爲「檢討現行制度所加以建設之障碍」。下午二時市政衛生兩工程學會　　宣讀論文，大會則開始會務討論。晚工程演講，題為「全國鐵路破壞與修復」。</p>

<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕此間之義大利外交官對於前義殖民地之得以獲得早日解決，均表悲觀。彼等預料義屬領之最後解決，須待　兩年以后，大部份時間將耗費於硏究　地情況，調査居民意見之上。彼等復料在四强外　舉行會談之初步階段，當不致徵求　政府之意見，但料羅馬將派專家來倫敦，以備臨時提　意見。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕四强外長特別代表在此開始討論義屬領之前夕，埃及政府向英美蘇法四國提出備忘錄，申述埃及關於此一問題之意見，除支持其他阿拉伯聯盟國家之要求，主張使面積六十萬方哩之里比亞，成爲阿拉伯獨立國外，並具有埃及本國對于北非之若干特定要求，內容迄尙未曾透露。同時此間義外交人士透露，義大利期望能出其託管其前屬領，庶能保障現居該地二十萬義人之生活，而盟國因此亦可表現其重視六十年來義大利在該處所耗金錢人力，以開發此等處女地之勞績。</p>
<h3>希土及阿刺伯國家　醞釀地中海同盟　阿主張北非義屬地由埃及託管</h3>
<p>〔路透社開羅二日電〕阿拉伯聯盟秘書長阿柴姆，今日自倫敦紐約返歸此間後，招待記者發表談話，述及聯合希臘土耳其阿拉伯聯盟國家，可能再加義大利，合組地中海同盟之可能性，渠云，阿拉伯聯盟尙未考慮此種建議，但渠個人認爲爲和平之利益起見，贊成在兩大主義之間，建立堅强之緩衝力量，渠相信此一建議若能促進維持和平，消除新戰爭的威脅，則無人將反對地中海同盟之建立。阿柴姆於述及義殖民地問題時，表示不信四强能就此事成立恊議，並聲言阿拉伯決反對此等土地之交還義大利。阿拉伯人與義人奮鬥已有二十年之歷史，准許義人重返其屬地，等於排擠助戰盟國之阿拉伯人。渠並重申阿拉伯聯盟之政策，即主張的黎波里泰尼亞與西倫奈加之統一，必要時　於埃及託管之下。</p>
<h3>美國防部長　答維辛斯基　稱美工商界不欲戰事</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二日電〕國防部長福萊斯特昨夜宣稱，「美國工商界不欲戰爭，美國勞工亦然。」此言顯係答覆蘇外次維辛斯基在聯合國大會指責美國一部份人爲「戰爭商人」。福氏並謂，馬克斯主義以爲實業家在陰謀醞釀新戰爭，全屬無稽之談。實則美國工商業係投資于和平，二十個月以來，美國商業投資於新工厰，新商店，新公用事業，新運輸事業及新礦業者，已在二百億美元以上。此種生產及分配事業專門製造平時貨物，　特用在供給國人，且欲運銷全世界，初非欲製造軍火。</p>
<h3>美蘇關係　可望改善　史泰遜促蘇改變態度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播：桑迭安哥訊，美共和黨總統候選人史泰遜今日吿新聞記者稱，美蘇關係可望改善。蘇聯將瞭解資本主義在在美國並未失敗，蘇聯秘密活動份子未能滲入美國，美國具有充分軍事力量。蘇聯在瞭解上述各點後，將改變對美國之態度，而設法改變兩國關係云。</p>
<h3>塔虎特嚴詞譴責　美政府縱容中共</h3>
<p>〔聯合社美國　沃明州加斯貝二日電〕共和黨參議員塔虎特今日在此發表其在西部各州末次競選演說，抨擊民主黨政府處理內政外交，舉棋不定，缺乏原則。國務部內部已無組織，且多傾軋。並謂渠不能相信政府所行政策，趨向和平抑或趨向戰爭。去年一年中，國務部之行動，實無一贯路綫可尋。一方面縱容中國共產党，但在希臘土耳其則又採取强硬措施。國務部雜亂矛盾，一至於此，尙不　向人民或國會宣佈全部事實。</p>
<p>〔聯合社　州　　　三日電〕前副總統華萊士昨夜在此間宣稱，「聰明人如塔虎脫者猶　　人國際救濟計劃　不智，殊　　人聽聞。任何二十世紀之美國人，如　維持及改善世界各國生活水準爲不可能之事，更屬不可思　。」</p>
<h3>聯大委會辯論希臘問題　烏克蘭抨擊英美　保阿兩國代表出席辯護</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約四日廣播：成功湖訊，聯大政治委員會今日開會，繼續辯論希臘問題。首先發言者爲烏克蘭代表曼努紐斯基，渠稱，「全世界均知英國軍隊留駐希臘，而南斯拉夫·保加利亞與阿爾巴尼亞則並無一兵一卒在希臘領土之內，美國之指責上述三國，顯係無的放矢，純屬謊言，須知希臘內戰之發生，實由於英軍支持反動政府，壓迫民主份子所引起者也。」</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖二日電〕聯大政治委員會今日恢復辯論希臘問題，保加利亞代表米佛拉指責美國政府故意利用聯合國機構，以掩飾其伸入巴爾幹及近東之擴大野心。米氏復批評聯合國巴爾幹調査委會之報告，否認保國曾以武器金錢或武裝人員恊助希臘游擊隊。阿爾巴尼亞代表繼起發言，指責希臘政府應負造成鄰邦間緊張關係之完全責任。</p>
<h3>波蘭將提議　廢止細菌戰</h3>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖二日電〕據悉，波蘭即將要求聯合國對於從事大規模屠殺之細菌戰爭加以禁止，蓋此項戰爭較原子彈更爲可怕與更難於管制。據稱，此項步驟將在聯合國原子委會中，引起廣大之反響，因該委會如開會，則此事之談判將在該會中進行。</p>
<p>細菌戰爭談判，除却使該委會成爲更較原子管制爲劇烈之戰場以外，對世界勢力均衡發生重大影響，因此事對於蘇聯與西方列强間之原子能問題引起之僵局，有極重大關係也。美國顯然現正獨佔原子能，而在原子談判上佔有主要地位，至於細菌武器則情形不同，每一國家皆有此項武器，祇須有一小瓶，即足以殺死全世界一半之人口。英美法等國，在此次大戰結束時，業已產生以細菌屠殺人類·牲畜·及植物之方法，早已非秘密之事。蘇聯在此方面落後，想亦　事實。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦委會　聆取猶太意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖二日電〕巴勒斯坦猶太公會代表薜爾佛，今日在聯大巴勒斯坦委員會發言，據稱，巴勒斯坦阿　分治，　爲該地設立猶太故　所必要，則猶太人準備勉强接受分治計劃。但此种解決辦法，需要聯合國機構加以相當推動，並設立聯合國國際機構，監督巴勒斯坦阿猶人之分治以兩年爲期。按阿拉伯發言人　　一在該委會拒絕任何分治的解決辦法，　巴勒斯坦應設立獨立與民主的阿拉伯國，阿人將爲其主義奮鬥到底．今日會中亦　發生爭執，阿猶雙方立場似無妥恊之　。</p>
<h3>聖地阿人罷工　抗議分治計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷三日電〕巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人三日舉行總罷工，抗議聯合國分治之建議，參加罷工者達十萬人，並未發生意外。</p>
<h3>赫爾病況好轉</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓二日電〕前國務卿赫爾二日在伯塞特城海軍醫院慶祝其七十六歲壽辰。據悉，赫爾近況較今年任何時期爲佳。</p>
<h3>皮杜爾訪杜魯門後表示　法面臨重大危機　現存美元月終即將吿竭</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二日電〕法外長皮杜爾在白宮與杜魯門總統舉行三十五分鐘之談話後，發表談話謂，法國至　今年十一月一日，即無自美購置必需物品所需之美元。</p>
<p>法國之局勢已極危殆，必須得在十一月及十二月內覓得美元之新來源，否則法政府將不得不頒佈新限制條例，以嚴格限制向美購買必需之小麥，煤斤，及工業原料。皮氏並謂布魯塞爾委員會所分配之價值九千三百萬元之德國所　黃金，祗能維持極短時期，不足以減輕法國美元需要之急迫性。</p>
<h3>國際關稅談判　本月十五日結束</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕國際貿易機構籌委會秘書長魏特吿記者稱，日內瓦之國際關稅談判，可於十月十五日結束。與會各國承認在目前環境下，有繼續採用限制措施之需要，故暫定在一九五年三月以前，爲保護初生工業及保護收支不易平衡之國家起見，得採用限額輸入制度，按中印澳巴西等國力主維持限額制。</p>
<h3>英蘇貿易談判　即將恢復舉行</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕政府二日透露，已完成重開英蘇談判大規模以機械及製造品交換蘇聯小麥之序幕。若干方面推測，蘇聯雖稱今年豐收，但或仍不能輸出大量小麥。據上次在莫斯科之英蘇貿易商談，雖雙方代表認爲已屬無　，而英國由於政治理由，仍加以延長。</p>
<h3>義政局緩和　羅馬總罷工可避免</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬二日電〕內政部次長馬賴柴今夜宣稱，羅馬省明日總罷工已可避免。</p>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬二日電〕共黨羽翼下之勞工聯盟，二日晚在午夜截止期前三十分鍾，決定暫緩發動羅馬總罷工，同時且考慮政府方面所作取消二十萬工人罷工之緊急呼籲。然三萬盤據者强佔私人土地已有十一日，而至今尙無跡象指出政府調解人員能解決地主與盤據者間之糾紛。</p>

<p>〔大　訊〕紐約四日廣播：美國務院近東及非洲司長赫德森，今日在伊美商業恊會之宴會廳上發表演說稱：「美國準備在聯合國憲章範圍之內，以一切適當之援助給予伊朗」，藉以阻止外國干涉伊朗內政。赫氏對伊朗在大戰中對聯合國之貢獻，備致祟揚，但演詞中並未直接提及蘇聯，僅提及一九四三年之三强恊定，即英美蘇三國曾同意保證伊朗之主權及領土完整是也。</p>
<h3>伊議員主張　佔巴林羣島</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦二日電〕德黑蘭電台稱：哈馬登省議員艾斯在伊朗國會中發言，述及波斯灣內各島在戰略上之重要性，渠要求伊政府派兵進駐波斯灣內之英國保護地巴林羣岛。艾氏謂政府應知成爲印度洋及亞曼海之主人，有　於掌握波斯灣。按巴林羣島具有中東最富油源之一，其對岸沙地阿拉伯海岸之　倫，即爲英美擬築阿拉伯輸油管終點之一。</p>

<h3>攔阻復工搗毀電車　工人九十六名被捕　無辜卅八名釋出四打手解警備部　車廠險遭襲擊彈壓始免　武裝保護恢復第一輛車</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕法商電車工潮拖延至今日已屆一週。昨晨職工多遵令較弱前往車廠凖備復工。工會監理委員會於八時平開出定備華一輛，車號17F，由社會局調派會服務英商電車之失業工人孫金祥　駛（山東人，二十一歲，住大西路汪家弄二十三號），凖備往接工人復工，車上並派有警察三名當行經重慶南路西門路口海軍聯誼社附近時，突自復興公　走出手持鐵尺石塊等武器之罷工工人百餘人上前攔阻，將定備軍四面玻璃窗搗毁無遺，並痛毆孫金祥，致臉面及內部受傷。其時準備去廠復工之工人正絡繹於途，見秩序混亂，頓起恐慌，相率散避。而預伏車廠四周徐家匯路及建國西路郵局附近之罷工工人則乘機活動擬集合向公司軍廠衝去。駐廠保一護之保警第三中隊百餘人，出動彈壓，同時警察總局得報後，即由警備課長陸大公率警備車馳往，騎巡隊亦出動二十名。同時嵩山　家　　局亦派出大批警察，兜捕，當塲捕　有搗亂嫌疑之工人九十六各，內五十二人由嵩山警局拘押，四十四人由　家　警局拘押。出事時周圍戒嚴，交通斷絕，至十時許始吿恢復。受傷之孫金祥經送醫院包紮後，返家療養。</p>
<p>午後警備司令宣鐵吾至盧家灣分局詢問出事經過，由分局長陳志淸詳述一過。宜司令勸諭非至不得已，應先以和緩手段對付。下午經將會犯詳加偵訊後，查得在押嵩山警局之十八工人及盧家灣警局二十工人係屬無辜，彼等皆係前往公司復工而於混亂中被捕者。經社會局及工會向警局證明，陸續保釋令返廠復工。其中有四人則經出事時在塲警察指認係動手毆打者，因情節較實，移送警備部軍法處究辦。談四人爲：趙年根（十七歲，上海人，電氣部）。李桂福（廿六歲，龍華人，修理部）。姚潤泉（卅一歲，武進人，修理部）。于貴實（廿六歲，鎭江人，司機）。其餘在押警局之五十四人，則尙在繼續偵訊中。</p>

<p>至被毆受傷之孫金祥，昨據吳局長稱，政府已先送其家屬生活費五百萬元，一切醫　費用亦將由政府負擔。</p>

<h3>空前偉大建築物　抗戰勝利紀功碑　象徵我國無限光明前途，　·定雙十節舉行落成大典</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶九月卅日航訊〕重慶——這個戰時的陪都·它不但是位居我國西南重鎭，而且是究成偉大歷史使命的領導八年浴血抗戰獲得勝利的司令台，它曾榮獲過「世界和平燈塔」的稱譽，唯一具有選歷史紀念性的建築物當推民權路（即都郵街）的抗戰勝利紀功碑，她的前身——戰時的精神堡壘——代表着中華民族抗戰必勝的精神，現在她正象徵我國勝利建國偉大光明的前途。</p>
<p>籌備經過</p>
<p>她事前的籌建情形是這樣的：在抗戰勝利前夕的翌年十月卅一日恭逢元首蔣公六旬大慶，陪都各界發起祝　獻金，市長張　倫以我領袖率領全國上下經過八年的艱巨抗戰獲致勝利，完成　功偉業，為紀念這民族復振悲壯史實並敬悼為國犧牲的軍民，根據蔣公於三十四年十二月指示設計之陪都十年建設計劃草案提請將全部獻金從事興建這「紀功碑」設立勝利祀功碑籌建委員會，訂工程經費爲五億元，設備費爲五千萬元，由都市建設計劃委員會常務委員黃賓勳，專門委員劉達仁主持策劃工作，建築方面由該會建築師黎倫傑設計，土木工程師李際棻建築師唐本善，張之蕃，郭民瞻等共同協助，電氣設備由電氣工程師李宗嶽，工程進行由天府營造廠得標承造，民國卅五年十月卅一日由張市長主持奠基動工建造，預訂全部工程爲八個月，在一切物質條件缺乏的山城的情形下，進行着艱巨的工作，又爲了經濟條件的限制力求撙節，實際上共用去工程經費一億八千三百餘萬元，設備經費一千九百餘萬元，全部工程預計本月底以前即可完竣，聞現已決定於本年雙十節舉行落成典禮，並悉在典禮開始時，將由市府負責向渝中央警官校借用信鴿二百隻，鴿脚繫各色紙條，飛翔空際，以壯偉觀，此舉亦不失爲別開生面的絮聞。</p>
<p>偉大姿容</p>
<p>紀功碑設計，係八面塔形的高　建築，分碑台，碑座，碑身及瞭望台。整個碑的建築於都郵街　塲，除三公及人行道，面積爲二十公尺直徑之圓形，因此碑台部份之育石及石踏步爲十公尺半徑圓形，靑石台高一公尺六，合階留花圃。碑座：有石碑八面採用北碚出產之上等峽石，上面刻載蔣主席之豐功偉業與八年抗戰之史詩，以八根　石砌結護柱組成碑座，石碑嵌於碑座外面，碑身：高度爲二十四公尺，由四公尺直徑之圓筒構成，內部圓形外爲八角形，每角邊綫以米黃色面磚舖砌，內有懸臂旋梯一百四十步，直升至瞭望台，沿旋梯設抗戰勝利走廊，廊上掛抗戰英雄，偉大戰績及日本簽降等油畫，下則嵌藏各有市贈送之祀念碑石及社會名流題贈之石碑。瞭望合較底部爲寬，直徑爲四公尺五，可容二十人登臨遊覽，碑設標準鐘一座，四面可見，環繞鐘之四面爲祀念抗戰有功之海陸空電將士及後方農工生產之勞績，　塑浮彫四塊，爲鋼筋混凝土搗成油古銅色，瞭聖台之頂設風向儀，風速器，指北針及有關測候儀器，頂懸繁鐘一個以備全市慶祝集合或報警之用</p>
<p>堅實建築</p>
<p>全部建築用鋼骨水泥，外用白洋灰磨石。每面設五窗，均鋼筋水泥窗花並經防空之處理。至於電器設備，分本身照明及外射照明，本身照明，有水銀太陽燈八根圍繞碑頂，內部每廣有水銀燈一根，外射照明，則由八個强有力的探照燈，自各方投射碑身，使整個碑身現露於八條柔和的光綫中。據建築設計師唐倫傑稱：其碑如不因外在重大的破壞原因，至少可耐久至三百年以上，堅固有若一砲壘，爲五百鎊重爆炸彈所不能毀。碑身槍彈不如，碑身正面大門爲特選楠木精製，整個碑的建築共用鋼筋二十五噸，洋灰九百餘桶，建築設計，純採用現代化之混合樣式，爲我國空前之唯一偉大紀念建築物，亦爲職後新興建築所未可比擬之壯觀。</p>
<p>光明燈塔</p>
<p>在籌建的募款中，雖有少至二千元多至數十萬元之別，可是她是代表了百萬市民的心，也是舉國上下在八年艱苦卓絕的掙扎下所產生的共同的結晶，她是反抗侵略的先鋒，反法西斯的堡壘，她替我們刻劃出了中國在歷史上從進受到的恥辱以至終於全部　雪而躍爲領導世界趨向和平之國家之一。從遠遠看去，在她那稱穆莊嚴的表面同建築的偉大，在淡黃色同天際蔚藍相映的色彩下，表現了這富有五千年以上悠久歷史的國家民族性之誠樸堅忍不拔的精神，終於公理戰勝强權贏得和平曙光的來臨，民主得以維護，人類正義得以伸張，她給與人們以不可磨滅的印象，這號稱「世界和平燈塔」的重慶，唯一具有偉大的歷史紀念性的抗戰勝利紀功碑，永遠是那樣靜穆莊嚴，有如一個堅起脊梁的巨人，為舉國上下訴述出血和淚的一　輝煌的史頁，她吹動了響澈世界和平，正義的諧音的號角，號召着全國同胞向民主光明的大道「前進！前進！」（陶俊超）</p>

<h3>華股由疲轉穩·　·永紗臨收提高</h3>
<p>行扒進，國行交換差出甚多，人心忽好，於是證金傳說又起，買風不斷，逐步提高，臨收永紗反以高價結束。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>微穩，遞交永紗開後賣到二六六元，此際現交永紗頗形堅定，而回升至即交二六二元，遞交二七一元。布市報俏，而堪外息價開低至二角二角半二角七，十一時後，又低至二六四元半。以分別有扒結，現遞永紗，稍有回好，但大戶之壓力又殷，小股及雜股倍形軟弱。臨收時迫低至即交二五二元，遞交二六一元，而以二五二元半及二六二元之價收市。新華中紡回瀉甚多，新亞跌至限度。結果較前收即交股計永紗信和華豐新光中法閘北中絲麗安微挫，美亞景福勤興內衣榮豐統益恒豐低半成，新華中紡跌一成，新亞跌停板，商務火柴中興均平，遞交股計景福勤興跌半成，永紗信和美亞新光微降，華豐平平。</p>
<p>後巿</p>
<p>承午收後之餘風，已見穩定，開後購買者多，布市及港匯助買，國行交換大量差出，並傳證金將於下期起改善之說，連續盤好，永紗以即交二六九元，遞交二七四元半高價收市，收後喊高少許。結果較晨收即交股計永紗華豐新光景福勤興中法新華內衣統益中紡升半成，美亞信和漲一成，商務尙平，餘均微升。遞交股計永紗信和新光景福升半成光景，信和華豐微升，塲外各老股計華商大生世界微挫。</p>
<h3>外股平穩　統債昨停市</h3>
<p>外股昨仍平穩，各方興趣集中橡皮股，熟股成交有限，起仆不大，證券帮有供，廣帮略買。怡紗晨開一二九〇〇〇，午後以一三〇五〇〇元高價結束，較前收計會德豐航業微降，電話平平，餘股微升。</p>
<p>公債昨因五五〇室收統丙五十萬之票據有問題，業中謀解決之</p>
<p>華股昨前市在工潮聲中，賣氣仍熾，交易不多，依然頹廢不振，續現低價。紗布又俏，廣帮及某洋道，是以停市一天。統丙暗盤仍在一六〇〇〇元左右。</p>
<h3>食米平定</h3>
<p>昨南北兩市共到米糧一萬二千六百餘石，南市先堅後懈，結果粳米平正，秈米略升三五千元，白元新粳定勢，北市初疲後挺，秈米挺秀，粳米軟化，白元平平。</p>
<p>麵粉早疲後緊，廠粉彷彿，惟統粉雜牌粉均削一二千元，洋粉貨稀倘俐，市面獨挺。配粉須今日決定，麩皮實銷平淡，微挫三五百元。豆餅汕顯不動，節節下游，猛跌四五千元，黃豆以油餅俱跌，廠方無意進取，零化平淡，市勢轉軟。</p>
<p>菉豆供求兩少，形勢平庸。蠶豆去化不爽，暫無變化。莞豆南洋略取，市勢牢立。小麥仍堅，紅糧去胃見淡，明定暗疲。苞米消化不振，回低二三千元。芝蔴貨多銷細，下挫萬元，生仁新陳背道而馳，新貨客帮尙可，價挺萬元，陳貨則胃呆少神。</p>
<p>油市堅疲互有，生油因產區高昂，依無堅挺。豆油淸油均見回小萬元，菜油受主稀少，猛挫三四萬元，蔴油亦跌二三萬元。</p>
<p>國藥上升</p>
<p>國藥被外匯掛高，南洋羣島等地來貨，成本加重，是以胡椒上升至每斤八萬五千元，原汕茴八千元，老揀香十二萬元，印揀香亦被帶上至五萬元，　費增價以後，川漢·西懷·關北·洋廣，以及近地土產，莫不大受衝動。川玉金二百粒頭每斤呌二萬八千元，撫極芎每斤呌二萬八千元，芎王二萬六千元，刁芎二萬四千元，略有成交。十六支生地，每斤呌一萬六千元。小生地，呌價八千元，六千五百元稍有成交。黨參呌每斤廿萬元，尙未成交。</p>
<h3>中農撥出秋繭貨款　已達九百四十餘億</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行奉命舉辦之秋繭貸款，截至目前止，業由該行匯出者，共達九百四十八億五千五百萬元。包括蘇省五百九十二億八千七百萬元，浙省三百五十五億六千八百萬元。兩省產繭區分別貸放實數，刻在整理表報工作，一時雖未及完全寄滬，然預料貸出總數當不及匯出之多。其主要原因，以今年秋陽驕灼，桑葉水份稀少，及桑蝗活躍，影響秋兩收成。此外，則以米價上昇，蠶農易將在手鮮繭流作土絲。按政府規定鮮繭每担收價一〇八萬元，（以繅質四六〇斤烘質三〇〇斤為標準）廠商另加每担開支費三四萬元，共爲一四二萬元，而製造土絲之收價遠出此數。據悉：在政府未曾核定收價時，廠商以爭取時間關係，有付出高價搶購者，對此差額問題，政府自難承認。爲彌補廠方損失計，前會由蠶絲產銷協導會下設之設計委員會商討及之，預料此一問題，常在今日（四日）上午協導會舉行會議，獲得決定。</p>
<h3>輸出入管委會　各區處長已定</h3>

<h3>臺匯不旺　黑市匯率低於官價</h3>
<p>臺幣於最近三月來，對法幣之匯率，已先後調整數次，由四十元至四十四元，五十一元，六十五元而至七十二元。但雖經歷次調整，當地法幣需要量增加，現鈔猶感缺乏，故黑市匯率反低於官價。因當地商民皆吸收法幣，向華南購買走私進口物資，同時向國外訂購物資，亦均需要法幣申購外匯，以致滬台間匯款曾一度停頓。近日方由當地工商華商彰化工商業銀行，開始接受匯款，按官價八折結匯。台幣一元折合法幣爲五十七元六角，聞匯款者仍不多。</p>
<h3>行局一致差出　銀根略見鬆動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國家行局昨在票據交換所差出七七一億元，銀根已轉鬆動，惟暗息仍站在二角關口，華股場外多方貼息已减低至二角八分半。差出入細數中，中央差出二〇四億元，直接換交行莊差入七一六億元，外商差入八五億元，代理交換行莊差出三十億元。</p>

<h3>人造絲軋升</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午疲落，下午忽又上揚，結果比上日軋升一百萬元弱。一二〇號高山有光，上午四千四百五十萬元有成交，最小到四百萬元，中午已達五百萬元。下午因紗價提高，外埠廠商且稍有吸胃，以致喊價上抬，最後爲六百二十萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>因供多求少，昨巿各級喊價俱短去五十萬元左右。五擔頭仍乏做開，C字等級討價四千五百萬元，還價四百五十萬元未成交，零擔價在三百萬與四百萬元之左。干經高零擔昨三千一百萬元有交易。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨巿大誠與華强眞絲被面，開巿六百九十萬元有成交，後因供求失衡，節節下降，迄近收市時，做七十八萬元即期價，隔日期九十五六萬元之疳。美亞被面隔日喊價七百萬元賣出，格子　縐仍喊五萬八九千元。華錦縐四萬元，民生競芳呢十二萬元，盛貨中山葛四十三萬元，其餘各貨，均頗平定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會棉紗議價，昨日再度提高，廿支紗掛一五二〇萬元，較前又漲起七〇萬元。其他各支紗，參酌市况並比例推算核定。</p>
<p>昨日棉紗巿况，初開平穩，嗣因銀根鬆弛，本街及津帮吸胃增加，更以紡調會議價，對廿支粗紗掛高七十萬，四二支細紗提高一百卅萬元，市塲人心倍形挺俏，進取尤濃，行情一致喊高。最後四二支藍鳳紗，比上日回漲九十五萬元，廿支特雙馬及輕雙馬，均升五·三十萬元，其他十六支十支及各支細紗，每件軋升二三十萬至八九十萬元不等。</p>

<p>棉布暴漲</p>
<p>昨日棉布市面，突又暴騰，各布再創新高峯。聞天津帮對陽光細布有大量收吸，因該地價較滬市高十萬元一疋，另有匯水可套，並傳北運可能開放，更兼棉紗議價又見掛高，同業對紡建售布，有兩期未曾開貨，市上現貨不充，至買氣甚旺，人心振奮，行情俏利。迨至午收，十二磅龍頭細布一路哄高至七十萬元，比上日每疋猛漲五萬八千元，五福藍鷄彩球等細布亦升五萬七至六萬七千元。嗶嘰直貢元布士林布等，時値旺銷，漲風更銳，其餘漂布斜紋府綢等亦甚挺秀。</p>

<p>捲烟回漲</p>
<p>昨捲烟市况，初開因有永和派貨，行情平庸，旋因新買搜吸，中午又有烟稅將調整値百抽百之說，進戶胃口更健，價再抬高。最後十支大英烟做高至一千七百九十萬元，比上日回漲六十萬。老刀烟亦升七十五萬。其餘中外各條烟亦均上揚一二千至四五千元，惟聽頭烟軋降。</p>

<p>徐儀君：來函已悉。對於你的遭際，我們當然表示非常同情，照你的來信推測起來，你們的愛情是屬於「一見鍾情」式的，靑年男女，往往因爲一時情感衝動輕易地便墜入瞭情網，沒有相互的認識，也沒有相互間的瞭解，這種「愛情」的基礎往往都是很不穩固的。你進大學後的第二個月，就與她開始了「友誼」，不久你們都相互宣誓「白頭偕老」，這種「閃電式」的戀愛，往往是沒有良好的結果的。</p>
<p>她寫信給你，說她的雙親反對這項婚姻，因此就對你冷淡，假使她是眞正愛你的話，事情是決不會如此簡單的。</p>
<p>戀愛是人生過程中的一部份，決不是整個的人生，戀愛成功固然可喜，失戀也未必可悲，廣大的世界，決不會沒有你容身的地方的，你應該將你的「愛」擴大到廣大的人　身上去，將你的精神寄託到未來的事業上去，我們相信你一定能夠爲之釋然的。祝你進步　（編者）　（來函刊二日本欄）</p>

<h3>最近的葡萄牙劇壇</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>葡萄牙劇院的背景是生存派。所謂生存主義（Existentialism）不過是「爲生存而生活」的意味，熱狂，呌囂，前衝。商人動謹而少幻想，不大能理解抽象理論。他們稱藝術爲妖艷，美貌性的要求。所謂生存就是「鬥牛與婦人與酒」。最近於國劇的大約是行吟歌者，他們唱着使人心碎的謠曲，葡萄牙人圍坐着整夜地諦聽。</p>
<p>像每一個歐洲大陸的首都一樣，里斯本自誇也有一個國民劇塲。它那哥林多（Corinthian）建築的正面，是毫無生命地摹作巴黎和倫敦的。偶然演一次希臘古劇「安悌岡尼」（Antigone）或葡萄牙的古倫理劇，否則就演那早已過時的「少奶奶的扇子」。</p>
<p>比起通俗的娛樂來，所謂國際戲劇只好算是不毛之地。不過有一位喜劇家李伯樂（Fran　cisco　Ribeiro）是値得稱述的，他以爲葡萄牙眞正的戲劇是可以有力而且普遍的。他熱誠的相信他本國人的戲劇趣味，數年以前，他組織了一個幽體，稱爲人民劇院，劇目有紫霍甫兩個獨幕劇和梅特林克的「室內」（Interior）。這些戲劇都得到很大的成功，比任何本國的笑劇都有效果，農民們驚奇地張開嘴一直看下去。。</p>
<p>三年前，李伯樂在里斯本主持特里尼大劇院（Trinidad　Theatre）揭出「自由的呼聲」的標幟。立刻國家劇院就有半打最好的演員跑到他的陣營裏去。當時該城的人還很少聽到易卜生和紫霍甫，「仲夏夜的夢」還剛被發現，他用再接再厲的努力，繼續演出了蕭伯納，霍普特曼，吉洛杜（Girandour）和沙爾德理（Sortre）。現在所準備的戲碼，包括英，俄，美，西班牙等國的戲劇。</p>
<p>小國想要演出國際的戲劇，最大的問題便是翻譯。里斯本情形複雜，文人大都不得自由。李伯樂只好親自動手來譯。</p>
<p>李伯樂稱他的劇國爲「里斯本的喜劇演員」。他把各地說拉丁語的劇團都稱爲「喜劇演員」，各劇團的演員可以互相交換。例如，馬德里的喜劇演員，羅馬的戲劇演員等等。像這樣，不久的將來可以成為廣大的國際性的戲劇聯合。</p>
<p>還有一個小劇院，觀衆擁擠，使人氣看書窒息，秩序又亂，這便是里斯本標準的葡萄牙劇的演出，頭排坐着摔塲的人，向台上的朋友抛吻。差不多等於愛美的演出。</p>
<p>同樣足爲標準的葡萄牙通俗劇院，最近有歌劇「洗衣婦」頗爲成功。廐，乾草，冀和兩頭瘦驢都是眞的，葡萄牙農民的技巧將接近莫斯科的藝術了。</p>
<h3>文藝語錄　東方蒙霧</h3>
<p>一般的，擺在我們這時代作家的面前的，照我的意見，是這樣的任務：必須學習寫作那爲大多數人類能够了解的作品。必須引導民衆發生文學的興趣。</p>
<p>因此，便要寫明白的，簡潔的，儘量單純化的作品。—左勤克</p>
<h3>五亭橋下——楊州續夢之二十一</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>喜愛遊瘦西湖的揚州人，其所喜愛之處，會因性情而異，或學養而異，又戚年齡而異。即以筆者說，幼年在小學求學時，午後散學，常是約三五同伴，連跑帶跳，一直到小金山的對河，花費銅元一兩枚，便可全體渡河，直登後山風亭，四顧蒼茫，高歌一曲，或狂嘯數聲，便又匆匆歸去。那時小金山的風亭，應是筆者所最喜愛的了。後來偶然弄筆，看似雅好文藝，實均淺嘗即止，却因此染習到不少文人氣習。於是遊瘦西湖時，便喜駕扁舟一葉，落寞的向烟水迷茫處去，風雅一點說，是尋覓詩料，實亦不過藉以愜幽懷，騁遐想而已。又因不喜熱鬧，便懶得向遊船多處廝混，尤不喜見到「請上坐」「泡好茶」的山寺俗僧，也便不會在小金山·徐園·以及法海寺等處張筵取樂，以示豪邁。不過無論如何，瘦西湖的五亭橋下，總是任何人都很喜愛之處，似乎並不因性情，學養，以及年齡而異。</p>
<p>揚州畫舫錄上說：「四橋烟雨，一名黃園，黃氏別墅也。」又說：「四橋烟雨，園之稱名也。四橋：虹橋，長春橋，春波橋，蓮花橋也。虹橋，長春，春波三橋，皆如常制，運花橋上建五亭，下支四翼，每翼三門，合正門爲十五門，圖志謂四橋中有王版，無虹橋，今被玉版乃長春嶺旁小橋，不在四橋之內。」筆者生晚，巳不見畫航錄中所說的玉版橋以及春波橋，僅見虹橋，長春橋，以及蓮花橋。這蓮花橋，即俗所稱五亭橋，因爲「上建五亭」的原故。不過在民國二十二年以前，年久失修，橋上五亭，陸續倒坍，至於一亭都無，一時遊人遂戲呼爲無亭橋。至二十二年，邑人王柏齡等倡修此橋，組織了重建揚州五亭橋委員會，募了好幾千元，幷且移用了城內皇宮的磚瓦木料，才將橋上的五亭重建起來，至今還有王氏撰的重建五亭橋記石刻安置在橋上。</p>
<p>這橋上因爲有五亭，偶立橋頭，看看四圍景色，橋下遊船，不畏烈日，不憂驟雨，固然也饒有意趣，但終不及橋洞裹別有洞天。畫舫錄上所說「下支四翼，每翼三門」，就在每翼三門中，也就是橋洞裏，可容小遊船兩隻，或大遊船一隻。在事實上，大遊船是不多進去的，因爲最多祗能進入一半，船梢要抛撇在外面，因而在這別有洞天之處，遂多爲小遊船所獨佔。</p>
<p>遊人們將小遊船撐進去以後，可以躺在藤椅上假寐。好風從三個門吹送進來，無論外面的驕陽如何逞成，這裏面却終是個淸凉世界。橋的正門是遊平山堂的必經之道，在裏面有意無意的迎送往來船隻，又是遊目聘懷的好處所。幷且隔水笙歌起落，沿河楊柳低昂，尤可悅耳娛目。</p>
<p>不過這橋洞裏雖可容小遊船兩隻，但如有一隻已經進去，做了先得的捷足，於是後到的便多停在外面，或即望望然而去了。因此五亭橋下所謂「四翼」，不會怎樣擾攘起來。反正撑到橋洞裏面去的在於避囂，又在於納凉，偶或在於談情說愛，如志在遊湖，或想趕熱鬧，便不想撑進去，偶或進去停停，經過極短的期間就會離去。</p>
<p>筆者萍跡靡定，年齡愈大，逗留在揚州的時間愈少，每憶故鄕景色，首先必想到五亭橋下，可是又何能有再更多的閑暇時間，容許自家扁舟一葉，避　納凉於其下呢！</p>
<p>長帶觀音　·朱應鵬·</p>
<h3>懸岩與幽谷</h3>
<p>— 錢今昔</p>
<p>山嵐上，翠綠的樹蔭下，蜜蜂打着旋飛行，你曾經和你的友伴在那兒野宴過沒有？你曾經站在峯谷間，張大你的嘴巴，以聽取你的回音沒有？你也許傑地質學者一樣地探視岩石，你也許是一個獵人找尋豪豬和兎兒的洞穴；如果你是頑皮的孩子，你將爬上樹梢，向遠方四眺。</p>
<p>我也喜歡在嵐嶺間遊覽呢。我愛那些老松，它使我追想到古代松下石上，以棋弈來玩味人生的老翁；我愛那些流泉，它使我想到穿綠旗袍少女胸前的白金項鍊；我愛險峻的隘口，它是保衛疆土的勇十們架設機關槍的地方。聽流鶯百囀的歌聲，我恍惚處身於歌劇院裏；看花卉千種的舞姿，我懷疑自己在海外的瓊竹延裏。</p>
<p>而今天，沿着那一條曲折迂迴的小道，時時把衣襟從荆棘裏拉出來，我走到了一座奇特的峭壁之前。</p>
<p>這正是懸崖，望下去削壁千仞，深沉的幽谷喪，滿是藜棗與蔓榛，宛如一口古井。</p>
<p>說削壁千仞吧；山壁上却還多少有着可以攀手的岩角，可是久經侵蝕的石塊，彷彿只要一經風吹雨打，就會墜落似的，有誰敢攀下山去，一探那幽奇的深谷呢？</p>
<p>可是，不，愛聽故事的孩子，阻怯的孩子，勇敢的人是什麽都不怕的。</p>
<p>讓我編一隻故事給你聽吧！不知是在什麼年代，在這山嶺間，一個嬌美的公主和一個威武的騎士並騎打獵。</p>
<p>騎士是勇敢的，因爲他的內心有着愛，愛鼓舞他，愛導引他，愛使得他不怕一切困難。</p>
<p>打到了許多野兎，芷雉與班鳩，一隻翩舞着七色彩翎的孔雀引動了他們，他們追着它，追着它，一直追到即懸崖前。</p>
<p>在懸崖前，公主婚箭射中了它，那華貴的鳥兒就直墮到幽谷裏，掛在一株矮樹的枝頭，山風顫動着采翎。</p>
<p>「那是一隻多麼美麗的孔雀」，公主嘆一口氣，「我們追了它好多時候呢！可是我們却得不到它，你說，是嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我們是能得到它的。」騎士的回答很勇敢。</p>
<p>「除非它再會飛上來。」一個幽默得近乎悲哀的微笑。</p>
<p>死了的孔雀當然不再會飛上來，可是活着的騎士却會飛下去呢！他不顧公主的勸阻，跳下馬背，就攀下谷去，他矯健得像驚鷹，迅捷得像燕子，金色的甲胄閃着點點的耀光，他終於把孔雀取得了。</p>
<p>上來，把孔雀戲在公主的面前，公主笑了，一個溫柔的笑，她發覺世上最美麗的原來不是孔雀的彩翎，却是騎士的英姿。</p>
<p>哦！你許會搶着說話了，……是不是公主再想憧憬一下那珍貴的英姿，又把孔雀擲下谷去。</p>
<p>這以……而騎士就此做了幽谷的永世客呢！</p>
<p>哦！孩子，別那樣地想吧！那不太悽慘嗎？別再憂鬱吧！我吿訴你，那公主是有一顆善良的心的，她歡歡喜喜地伴了騎士回去了，牠立誓永不再到這懸崖前來俯望，也不許那騎士再來重探深谷之幽蹟。</p>
<p>於是，這懸崖就更其荒凉了，——你看，我不是為了太感寂寥而回轉身子了嗎？</p>

<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「紀小姐……！」一個尖裏帶濁的聲音，這時候，在耀羣身後高聲喊着。</p>
<p>耀羣吃了一驚，趕緊止步回身；同時，這奇怪嗓音打在耳鼓上，早觸動了她的記憶——那個半男半女的人妖！</p>
<p>「紀小姐，您不必找他們去，我知道他們的「窩兒！」回頭……」</p>
<p>「嗯？哦……哦！……」耀羣驚上加了一驚：這傢伙怎麼會突如其來對自己打起招呼來？……又怎麽會猜到自己的心事？</p>
<p>「對不起……「您這位！」耀羣說到這裏，頓住了口。她似乎不願稱它「小姐」或「女士「，就憑這怪物的嗓音，就像半吊子票友唱靑衣，花且，那種逼着聲帶，揑着鼻予　出來的尖嗓子；尖音之下，拖着一個　音尾子。</p>
<p>「咱們在哪兒見過嗎？」耀羣雖然　了一頓，却仍舊把這挑戰式的語句完成了；而且堅起了一雙翠眉，圓睜着兩隻黑白分明閃爍有光的眼睛。換句話，她是想說「誰認你這傢伙？」或「你認識你家祖宗嗎？」這位柬北女兒，使起性子來了。</p>
<p>「在哪兒見過，我回頭吿訴您……」敝人買沙夫，姓買，名沙夫……」說着，裂開兩片又厚又寬的嘴唇皮一笑，露出幾顆東倒西歪的大門牙和半截紫裏帶黑的牙齦。因它這嘴唇和牙齦都是紫黑色，只好這麽嚕嚕蘇地據直報道出來，否則就可蘇借用「血盆大口」四個字來形容，豈不省了筆墨？</p>
<p>這傢伙自我介紹之後，一閃身　到大門外，擦過耀羣身邊，下了一步台階，不等耀羣說話，便收了那副千金難買嚇得人死的笑容，一繃面色，緊接說道：「敝人現在還得趕上去，跟他們說兩句話！最多三五分鐘，回頭再跟您叼敎一件事……您千萬等一等，咱們都是一條綫上的，別害怕！……」邊說邊挪步退下台階；說畢，轉身便走，走了兩三步，好像又想起什麽來似的，扭轉虎頸，擧起手來冲着耀羣，揮了一揮，那幾根胡籮葡一般的手指，偏生模做着美人蘭花指頭的式子；臨揮手的當口，牙齒裏還溜出了嬌滴滴的兩個字：「拜拜！」「拜拜」之後，又是一笑。</p>
<p>古歌上說：「回頭一笑百媚生，六宮粉黛無顏色！」可是這傢伙那麽回頭一笑，簡直笑得山搖海動，天地變色。</p>
<p>照說耀羣應該趁這當口，使出本領，潛身隱形，跟了上去，吊它的錢，看看它的舉動因爲目前的形勢，人家的行動是暗的，自己却在明處；一舉一動，都在人家眼中。這是秘密行動最大忌諱。但耀羣沒有這麼做，她知道遇見了勁敵，最要緊的，是把「明」「暗」顚倒轉來；至少，要把這傢伙的根底和行動，調査明白，以便應付。可是在這短短三五分鐘內，要調這傢伙的行動，談何容易！</p>

<h3>Widespread Warfare in the Northeast　National Army Deploys Properly, People’s Hearts Are Calm　Shenyang Strengthens City Defenses, Martial Law Begins Today</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The Northeastern Communist bandits have launched a full-scale offensive, adopting tactics of small groups of forces attacking various transportation stations and strongholds in cities large and small, with flames of war raging everywhere. The National Army has adopted countermeasures in response to the bandits' actions. The bandits' six offensives first absorbed the majority of the National Army's forces in the Liaoxi Corridor, and then began their attacks. Jinzhou, Siping, and Yingkou are all targets the bandits cannot forget, but judging from the bandits' strength in Liaoxi, they are already exhausted and can only cause trouble by fleeing; they are not strong enough to engage the National Army in direct combat. Moreover, after the Battle of Siping, the military authorities made effective deployments early on, so even if the bandits have a major conspiracy, it is beyond their capabilities. Currently, traffic is disrupted to Pan's outer areas, west to Xingcheng, south to Liaoyang, and north to Kaiyuan. However, with Chen Cheng stationed in the Northeast, people's hearts are as calm as usual.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Air Force is dispatched in all directions, and the sound of aircraft is heard above Shenyang. Military agencies are working intensely, and public places are strengthening their guard. Shenyang has decided to declare temporary martial law starting from the 4th, with martial law hours from 9:30 PM to 5:30 AM the following morning. Prices have suddenly risen, with cigarettes, rice, and flour, etc., increasing by about one-tenth. Garrison Commander Chu Xichun convened his subordinates on the 3rd to discuss strengthening city defenses and public security. Zheng Dongguo flew back to Pan from Jinzhou on the 2nd to report to Chen on the course of the battle in Liaoxi and to jointly discuss ways to deal with the current situation.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] A bandit force in the northern section of the China Changchun Railway suddenly attacked Zhonggu Station between Tieling and Kaiyuan on the morning of the 2nd, and vehicles heading north were stopped at Tieling. The National Army at Kaiyuan retreated to Qinghe, and bandits from the Dabao area invaded Mazhonghe Station south of Changtu. A bandit force on the western route suddenly attacked the Xinminliuliu Station and Dabao on the Beining Road at 6:30 PM on the 2nd. Traffic police joined the National Army in a fierce battle with the bandits overnight, and the bandits retreated at dawn. In the southern section, bandits invaded Dashiqiao, and the National Army retreated to defend Yingkou. Furthermore, there were battles at Anshanbei Yuanyangnanshoushan and Lishan Stations. Shoushan and Lishan were occupied by bandits overnight, and the bandits were repelled at dawn on the 2nd. After Dashiqiao fell into the hands of the bandits, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant's location was isolated.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Changchun　Yitong, Huaide, and Other Places Abandoned</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] The fighting south of Changchun is increasingly approaching the city. Datun, south of Mengjiatun in Changchun, fell last night at 10:00 PM, and Fanjiatun also fell into the hands of the bandits. [Another Dispatch] The fighting in the Changji area has now unfolded separately. Princess Ling, Liufangzi, Taojiatun, and Fanjiatun, on the China Changchun Railway line, all experienced fierce fighting last night. Liufangzi has become a seesaw battle, Taojiatun was abandoned by the National Army, and Fanjiatun experienced a cannon battle all night. The Changchun telephone line was cut off at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. Lao Kaiyuan was invaded by the Communist bandits last night, and Princess Ling was still in fierce battle this afternoon. Yitong was captured by the bandits last night, and the Secretary-General of the county party headquarters was kidnapped. Bandit forces split into groups at 4:00 PM on the 3rd, one group fleeing to Danantun, and another Princess Ling. The Xian bandit forces are moving south towards Panyang. Xi'an is reporting urgency. Sanjiang, west of Siping, has also seen fighting. The National Army at Danantun, 60 li south of Changchun, withdrew after achieving its combat results. Huaide, west of the China Changchun Railway, was again invaded by the bandits, and the National Army in Jiangmifeng, north of Jilin, also withdrew from its strongholds near Tangfang (6 kilometers west of Jiangmifeng), controlling the high ground west of Jiangmifeng. [Another Dispatch] Both Jilin cities experienced a power outage from 9:25 PM last night for a period of one and a half hours. Although the fighting on the periphery has spread and expanded, and prices in the city have soared due to the interruption of transportation, the general public is still very calm.</p>
<h3>Soviet Artillery Batteries in Lushun　Bombard Our Chinese Merchant Ship</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] A report from Zhanjiang on the 3rd states: A Chinese merchant ship sailing from Shanghai to Yantai was fired upon five times by Soviet artillery batteries in Lushun, but all shots missed.</p>
<h3>Liaoxi Bandits Leave Railway Line　National Army Supervising Repairs</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] After the National Army of Hebei exited the pass and recovered Wanjiatun, Qiansuo, and Huangdi Stations, the Communist bandits completely destroyed the railway and withdrew from the line, engaging in fierce fighting with the National Army in the mountains west of the line. The above stations are being repaired under the supervision of railway engineer corps. However, because the destruction was severe, it will take until next Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest to repair. The Headquarters of the Communist Bandit's Jidong Military Region is currently stationed in Qianhua City. Two of the four brigades in Jidong have exited the pass to provide aid. The National Army is conducting extensive sweeps in various parts of Jidong.</p>
<h3>National Army's Sweeping Campaign in Chahar East　Remnant Bandits Flee South Across the Great Wall</h3>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 2nd] With autumn high and horses fat, the National Army in Chahar is conducting sweeps in various districts to protect the autumn harvest. Following the victory in Chahar North, Chahar East has also achieved combat results. The National Army in Huailai engaged in a fierce battle with the Bandit's Independent 4th Brigade and other units, totaling more than 4,000, south of Fanshanbao for three days. The bandits suffered heavy losses, and by September 30th, the bandits fled south across the Great Wall via Zifokou. The National Army is currently tracking and suppressing them along the Great Wall.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Fu Zuoyi Flew to Yulin　To Comfort the Troops and Civilians Defending the City</h3>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 3rd] Fu Zuoyi flew to Yulin in northern Shaanxi by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to comfort the troops and civilians defending the city and to discuss matters with General Deng Baoshan.</p>
<h3>Chahar Corps Enters Hebei Again</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 3rd] Zhang Zhixing, Chief of Staff of the Baosui Headquarters, stated: The National Army in Hebei will take advantage of the Communist bandits' engagement in reorganization and training to sweep them away first. The Chahar Provincial Corps is entering Hebei again and has arrived at Liulihe today. The remaining bandits on both sides of the Pingbao Road railway south can be eliminated.</p>
<h3>A Remnant Force of Chen Yi's Troops　Flees to the Border of Shandong and Hebei</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 2nd] It is reported that approximately 8,000 remnants of Chen Yi's troops have fled to Wudi on the border of Shandong and Hebei.</p>
<h3>North Korean Radio Broadcasts　Insidious Communist Orders　To Establish a Communist Government Throughout the Territory</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York, 4th Radio Broadcast: It is reported that the U.S. side intercepted a broadcast from the North Korean radio station, which included an order from the Communist Party advocating the immediate establishment of a Communist government throughout Korea after the withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops. The order was signed by the Propaganda Minister of the North Korean People's Committee, which also called on the Communist parties in North and South Korea to rise up together to eliminate reactionary elements.</p>
<h3>Lu Han Pays Respects to the Chairman　Reports on His Trip to the North</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Lu Han, Chairman of Yunnan, paid respects to Chairman Chiang in the afternoon of the 3rd and reported on his trip to the Northeast. Chairman Chiang also invited him to lunch. Mr. Lu flew to Beijing from Ping on the afternoon of the 2nd and is scheduled to fly back to Kunming early next week.</p>
<h3>National Army in Jiaodong Arrives at Muping　Navy and Air Force Destroy Weihaiwei Fortifications　Powerful Fleet Lines Up in Yantai Harbor, People Encouraged</h3>
<p>[Our Weixian Dispatch, 3rd] The National Army, which recovered Yantai, continued to advance eastward along the Weihai Highway on the 3rd. The vanguard reached the outskirts of Muping City after passing Xin'an on the 3rd and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits. The navy and air force have destroyed most of the Communist bandits' main fortifications between Muping and Weihaiwei. The remaining main force of the Communist Bandit's Ninth Column and a part of the Thirteenth Column, totaling about 10,000, who crossed the Wei River west have been surrounded by the National Army in the area south of Changyi and north of the Jiaoji Railway. A part of them, about two or three thousand, once harassed the outskirts of Weifang but have been repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 3rd]丁綍庭, the Mayor of Yantai, who entered Yantai with the army yesterday, recently sent a telegram urging personnel remaining in Qingdao to quickly return to their posts.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yantai, 3rd] Gui Yongqing, acting commander-in-chief of the navy, arrived in Yantai aboard the Emei warship on the evening of the 2nd to inspect. He went ashore on the morning of the 3rd to inspect the urban area. People gathered at the pier to welcome him. A powerful fleet lined up in the harbor, and the coast was filled with spectators. Gui frequently returned the greetings of the people, and the situation was unprecedentedly warm.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The mines in Yantai Harbor have been completely cleared. Single ships can now safely enter and exit. Materials and food are extremely scarce here, and the citizens earnestly hope that merchant ships from Shanghai, Qingdao, and other ports will quickly restore the Yantai shipping route.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zhou Defan, a French priest, Yang Yicheng, a priest, Xu Dexian, the principal of Chongde Girls' Elementary School, and Bai Hezheng (French), a nun, were kidnapped by bandits late at night on September 21st, and their whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Southern Section of Jinpu Railway to Be Open to Traffic Tomorrow　National Army Meets in Suxian　Chen and Liu's Bandit Forces Merge, Will Be Encircled Together</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 3rd] The bandits in Suxian captured Mengcheng at 11:00 PM on the 2nd. The bandits in Haoxian suffered heavy casualties after being bombed by the air force. Military transport in Bengbu is frequent, and the air force has returned north to assist in the battle, with the train station presenting a wartime scene.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Chen's bandits attempted to cross the Jinpu Railway eastward towards northern Jiangsu, but their attempt was foiled by the strong resistance of the National Army in Suxian. Chen's bandits are now leading the remnants of seven columns that did not make it eastward across the line of Mengcheng, Woyang, and Taihe, heading south to the northeastern part of the Dabie Mountains. They have merged with Liu's bandits, and the National Army is using a pincer movement to encircle Chen and Liu's bandits together. Fierce fighting is expected to break out on both banks of the upper reaches of the Huai River. The National Army, reinforced from the north and south to Suxian, joined forces with the Suxian defenders, who had fought bitterly for three days and nights, after recovering Xisipo and Fuliji. They are now fiercely attacking Chen's Bandit's Eighth Column southwest of Suxian.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The remaining bandits have been cleared from Fuliji in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway and the section from Suxian to Xisipo. The railway tracks and bridges destroyed by the bandits in Fusuxian were repaired in the afternoon of the 3rd, and trains heading south from Xuzhou will arrive in Su on the same night.

<h3>Remains of Missing Aircraft Discovered in Jiayuguan　Pilot and Passengers All Killed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] The Air Force Headquarters confirmed today that the electric transport plane that went missing between Dihua and Lanzhou on July 31st was burned and the fuselage has been found on a high mountain 20 miles northwest of Jiayuguan. The plane was carrying two passengers and six crew members, all of whom were burned beyond recognition. The mountain is 20,000 feet high and covered in heavy snow, and although investigators have been dispatched, the work is very difficult.</p>
<h3>Bandit Areas Are Actually Hell　Filled with Hypocrisy and Cruelty　Realization of a Left-Leaning Foreign Reporter</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yantai, 3rd] Australian left-leaning reporter Kaine has now realized that "the CCP is indeed an enemy of mankind." Kaine arrived at Shijiusuo from Shanghai on a UN relief ship last year and entered the Shandong bandit area. He stayed in the Communist area for seven months. As a result, he realized that the "human paradise" promoted by the Communist bandits was actually a human hell. He was completely deprived of freedom of information in the bandit area. The Communist bandits used strict methods to "entertain" him, but he still found that everything the Communist bandits did was hypocritical, deceptive, and cruel. When the Jiaodong Communist bandits collapsed, a ship was sent to "kidnap" him to Dalian. He was intercepted by our Shui Tai warship on the way and was able to meet with reporters on the ship. Kaine thought he was going to the bandit area to report on the "Communist Party's benevolent governance," but the facts told him that there was only tyranny and no "benevolent governance" in the bandit area. Afterwards, he said that what Snow had seen in the past was only the situation in Yan'an, the capital of the CCP. That was a false model made by the Communist Party for foreigners to see. This time, he went to various places in the Shandong Communist area and truly saw the true face of the Communist bandits.</p>
<h3>Huo Baoshu Dispels Intention to Resign</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Huo Baoshu, the head of the Xingzheng Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, strongly requested to resign due to illness, but his request was not approved. He was summoned to the capital the day before yesterday (the 2nd). It is learned that Mr. Huo first visited Chairman Jiang and President Zhang at the National Government and the Executive Yuan in Beijing yesterday morning. The Chairman and President both personally persuaded him to stay, and Mr. Huo has dispelled his intention to resign. He is now scheduled to return to work in Nanjing this morning despite his illness, as his health has not yet recovered.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Guiding Principles for Governing Guangdong　Establishing a Clean and Honest Atmosphere, Serving the Hometown With All Effort　Meets the Grandson of the Oil King to Discuss Developing Industries</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 3rd] The newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong, Song Ziwen, discussed issues related to the development of industries in Guangdong Province and the investment plans of domestic and foreign merchants in the Five-Year Plan with Rockefeller, the grandson of the oil king in China, at 10:00 AM this morning.

<h3>Sir Grantham Issues Statement　Resolves to Help Us Prevent Smuggling　Does Not Express Opinion on the Return of Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Hong Kong Governor Sir Grantham hosted reporters at the British Ambassador's residence this morning. After being introduced by Ambassador Stevenson and Secretary Geng Si, Mr. Grantham answered the questions raised by the reporters in detail. He stated that the trip was purely a friendly visit and that there was no task involving other commercial or financial technical matters. He had established good friendships with General Zhang Fakui and others soon after taking office and hoped to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Song Ziwen soon. He also believed that mid- and lower-level officials in Hong Kong and Guangdong should also have frequent contact. Regarding the Hong Kong smuggling problem, the Customs has broken more than 500 cases this year and seized smuggled goods worth US$500,000. The Hong Kong government is determined to do everything possible to assist China in dealing with this serious problem. In addition, regarding financial and economic matters, the Central Bank has agreed on some measures with the Hong Kong government. He emphasized that he is willing to strengthen Hong Kong's indispensable cooperation with China under any circumstances. The housing shortage in Hong Kong after the war is serious, and the Hong Kong government is fully engaged in the reconstruction work to meet these livelihood needs. The British post-war policy of governing Hong Kong is much more relaxed than before in the political field. Two-thirds of the City Council are elected by the people, with 30 councilors, half Chinese and half foreign. In the economic field, agriculture has been planned in the reconstruction. Engineering projects in Hong Kong are waiting to be repaired, and the Hong Kong government is also planning to open a tunnel between Hong Kong and Kowloon to strengthen transportation. As for the progress and timing of the negotiations between China and Britain on the return of Hong Kong, administrative officials have not expressed their opinions. In the evening, Mr. Grantham attended a banquet hosted by Ambassador Dai Weishi. At 5:30 PM, Vice Minister (Acting Minister) Liu Shiwu hosted a cocktail party, and at 8:00 PM, British Ambassador Stevenson held a farewell dinner for him. Mr. Grantham is scheduled to leave Beijing with his entourage at 9:00 AM on the 4th to return to Hong Kong to welcome the arrival of Lord Amon, a member of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China.</p>
<h3>Inflation in Hong Kong　Salaried Class Suffers</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] The situation regarding suppressing inflation in Hong Kong is obviously worse than it was a year ago. Chinese and foreign salaried employees feel increasingly distressed, and the Hong Kong dollar has also depreciated. In February of this year, a reporter exchanged US dollars for Hong Kong dollars at a rate of HK$4.10 per dollar, which was only HK$0.20 higher than the official rate (equivalent to US$0.05), and there was no trouble. However, when exchanging US dollars yesterday, the rate was HK$5.50 per dollar, which was HK$1.50 higher than the official rate, and there was a lot of trouble. Hong Kong still appears stable and clean on the surface, but prices are out of control, and the press is openly denouncing speculators, saying that this situation cannot be tolerated. Recently, the telephone company applied to the Hong Kong government to increase telephone charges, which has aroused public indignation.</p>
<h3>British Delegation to China Arrives in Bangkok</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 3rd] The British Parliamentary Delegation to China will arrive in Bangkok on the afternoon of the 4th and fly to Hong Kong on the morning of the 5th.</p>
<h3>Dong Xianguang's Speech　Refuting the China Democratic League's Defense</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, pointed out the facts that members of the China Democratic League colluded with the Communist bandits and participated in the rebellion at a press conference a few days ago. Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei have made some defenses on this matter. A reporter recently inquired with Director Dong about this matter, and he delivered a speech, listing three facts and refuting the defenses of Luo and Huang. (The full text of the speech can be found in the first column of the second page)</p>
<h3>The Reformist Faction of the Social Democratic Party　Denies Joining the China Democratic League</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A certain important member of the reformist faction of the Social Democratic Party recently solemnly stated that the rumor that the Reform Committee of the Social Democratic Party had joined the China Democratic League was completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Land Administration Conference Concludes　Zhang Qun Attends and Addresses the Meeting　More Than 200 Proposals Approved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Land Administration Conference convened its fourth and fifth plenary sessions on the 3rd, both in the morning and afternoon, concluding all the agenda items and holding a closing ceremony at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. President Zhang Qun attended the closing ceremony and addressed the meeting. Zhang pointed out that the main principles of the People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, such as "land to the tillers," "equalization of land ownership," and "regulation of capital," are still just slogans, so the problem of people's livelihood has not yet been solved. He encouraged those who implement land policies to not be afraid of wealthy gentry and to strictly implement various established programs. According to reports, the conference lasted for five days and approved more than 200 proposals.</p>
<h3>Our Proposal to Limit the Veto Power　Aims to Avoid Creating a Stalemate　All Parties in the Capital Pay Attention to China's Independent Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told our reporter in the afternoon of the 3rd regarding China's formal proposal to the United Nations to impose procedural restrictions on the exercise of veto power by the five permanent members of the Security Council: "China's action aims to break the stalemate caused by the abuse of the veto power in the past, but it does not mean that China intends to give up the veto power. This point is very important and should be correctly understood by the national debate and the people." The reporter noted that the measures taken by our representative and the independent stance taken on the peace treaty with Japan were both decided before Foreign Minister Wang and his party went abroad. The original intention was to make active provisions for the restrictions on the use of veto power, which could only be used when it involved the sovereignty and major interests of a country. Now, the proposal is to adopt passive provisions. By comparison, it is more feasible. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unwilling to speculate on which countries will approve or oppose the proposal, but believes that it is a beneficial tool for world peace and international cooperation based on experience and common sense, and can help the United Nations solve the difficult problems that are currently entangled. All parties in the capital only learned about the outline of the matter from the newspapers on the 3rd. Although there was no strong reaction, they are all paying attention to this important and independent diplomatic action of our country. (Our proposal can be found in the third column of the second page)</p>
<h3>The Resident Committee of the Political Participation Council Approves Proposals　Requesting Improvement of the Exchange Rate Between Taiwan and Shanghai　Suggesting the Government Provide Relief to Students Out of School</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Resident Committee of the Political Participation Council held a regular meeting on the 3rd. After Chairman Mo Dehui and the Secretariat reported, Shao Lizi read the written report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was roughly divided into three points: 1. We agreed with the US proposal to include the Korean issue on the agenda of the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, which has been announced by the delegation. 2. The British parliamentary delegation to China is coming to China. 3. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the French side in Vietnam, requesting them to stop the election of "Bangzhang." Then, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food reported on the administrative situation of the 36th year. Subsequently, the proposals were discussed, and three proposals were passed: 1. The proposal by Wang Puhan and two others requesting the government to quickly provide relief to students out of school was resolved to be submitted to the government for prompt action. 2. The proposal by Lu Qian and eight others requesting the government to improve and expand the methods of local councils was resolved to be submitted to the government for serious consideration. 3. The proposal by Lin Zhong and five others requesting the government to improve the exchange rate between Taiwan and Shanghai in order to stabilize Taiwan's economy was resolved to be submitted to the government for adoption. (The original proposal for improving and expanding local council methods can be found in the fourth column of the second page)</p>
<h3>Yu Feipeng Reports on Food Administration　And Frankly Explains Cases of Malfeasance</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Food Minister Yu Feipeng attended the Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council on the 3rd to report on the administrative situation in the 36th year, which was roughly divided into three points: 1. The procurement of military rations, the supply of public grain and civilian food, and 2. The improvements that should be made in various businesses of the Ministry of Food. 3. The burden of food in Siping, plus a 10% reserve, totals 44 million dan. However, although this year's harvest in the Yangtze River area is good, it can only be counted at 80%, so the actual grain requisition is based on 80%, with 36 million dan plus 10%, which is 39.6 million dan, which is the military grain. Secondly, the public grain and a part of the civilian food in Beijing and Shanghai are estimated as follows: Shanghai issues 220,000 bags of rice and 10,000 tons of flour every month. Beijing issues more than 50,000 dan of rice and more than 60,000 tons of flour every month. By the end of the month, the China Farmers' Bank has completed the purchase, and the rest needs 10 million dan. The first phase of 5 million dan is also purchased by the Agricultural Bank. Secondly, attention should be paid to storage. Minister Yu also frankly reported on the cases of malfeasance by the staff of the institutions under the ministry. From January to September of this year, a total of 508 cases were reviewed and compiled.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>中韓貿易恢復問題</h3>
<p>Regarding the resumption of trade between China and Korea, the government is considering it at the request of overseas Chinese in Korea and has decided on the principle of open trade. The Executive Yuan has issued a directive to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to inform the various overseas Chinese organizations in Korea to comply. A portion of the members of the Control Yuan, in order to prevent the crisis of disguised Sino-Japanese trade, suggested to the government on September 29 that if China-Korea trade is opened, the relevant departments should carefully revise the measures in advance and strictly control them afterward, paying attention to the requests of both sides and identifying the original place of origin and final destination of the goods to nip problems in the bud. The Control Yuan members are acting with caution, fearing that the resumption of Sino-Korean trade will become a disguised form of opening up Sino-Japanese trade. In reality, Sino-Japanese trade is one matter, and Sino-Korean trade is another. We do not fully endorse the opening of Sino-Japanese trade, but regarding the restoration of Sino-Korean trade, we take the position of safeguarding the interests of overseas Chinese and believe it is currently necessary.</p>
<p>China and Korea are fraternal countries with adjacent lands and somewhat similar customs, so the relationship of mutual need and assistance in economic terms is extremely close. Before the war, there were approximately 300,000 overseas Chinese merchants in Korea, with more than 5,000 shops. Including their dependents who depended on this for a living, there were no fewer than one million people. During the war, normal Sino-Korean economic activity was interrupted, and the entire Korean market was monopolized by Japan. With trade stagnation, overseas Chinese merchants were left with no income and were in dire straits. After the war, Korea was divided between the United States and the Soviet Union, which implemented different control policies. In South Korea, Koreans urgently needed Chinese goods, and the US military government proposed trade requests. Initially, our government insisted on settling in US dollars, but the interim measures were not accepted by the US side. Subsequently, following the example of the Sino-Japanese barter trade method, the Central Trust Bureau was designated to preside over it. On November 21 of last year, the Executive Yuan also issued an order to the customs authorities that Sino-Korean trade was being discussed with General MacArthur's headquarters. Before an agreement was reached, all applications for goods to be shipped to Korea were prohibited from export. As a result of this active restriction, the Central Trust Bureau never started the process because Sino-Korean trade was trivial and unprofitable, while the customs authorities used the ban as an excuse to seize all goods shipped back from Korea, forcing overseas Chinese compatriots who had no means of livelihood to sell their assets and convert them into goods for shipment. Regardless of the risks at sea, they risked their lives to return to their home country, only to have their goods seized and confiscated without any recourse. This is a significant harm to overseas Chinese merchants caused by strict government controls. In North Korea, the Soviet army completely locked down the external relations of Koreans and our overseas Chinese compatriots. Only the communist-occupied areas of Shandong, Liaoning, and Andong vigorously encouraged overseas Chinese merchants to go to Korea to barter, and exchange for marine products to be transported to our areas to extract legal currency. Under these circumstances of procrastination and indecision, the government not only failed to help the affected overseas Chinese compatriots, but also indirectly drove overseas Chinese merchants onto the path of supporting the communists. This mistake is harmful to both China and Korea and even more detrimental to hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots.</p>
<p>Before the war, Korea was a colony monopolized by Japan and was economically dependent on Japan. After the war, although Korea was nominally independent, the north and south were not unified, but the will of the Korean people was for independence, and their spirit was unified. Economically, Korea had long broken free from Japanese domination and became a commodity market for the United States and the Soviet Union. Koreans eagerly hoped for the resumption of Sino-Korean trade, and our overseas Chinese compatriots in Korea regarded the opening of Sino-Korean trade as essential to their survival. They repeatedly appealed, hoping that the government would have a clear understanding of this issue and reconsider it. In March of this year, the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held, and Central Committee members Fan Yuyu and others requested the restoration of Sino-Korean trade, stating the advantages and disadvantages. A resolution was made to submit it to the government for handling. Zhou Shenjiu, chairman of the China-Korea Trade Association, and others repeatedly petitioned the government in November and December of last year and April of this year to lift the ban on trade with Korea and proposed the principle of interim Sino-Korean trade measures before the establishment of a formal government in Korea, in order to restore normal relations as soon as possible. The Executive Yuan, following the requests of overseas Chinese merchants and weighing the advantages and disadvantages, recently decided on the following three principles: It is indeed necessary to consider opening up Sino-Korean trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should, in the short term, first ascertain the attitudes and policies of the United States and Korea, and then formulate detailed measures for navigation and trade. All confiscated goods belonging to overseas Chinese in Korea that fall under the category of temporarily suspended imports should be released after supplementary tax payments. Before Sino-Korean trade is officially opened, overseas Chinese in Korea who continue to apply for importing goods will be allowed to declare and pay taxes for release, except for prohibited imports; exports will be postponed. Based on these three principles, the government is allowing a partial, not full, resumption of Sino-Korean trade. The order prohibiting overseas Chinese merchants from exporting goods, issued last November, has been partially revised, but the ban has not been abandoned. According to this principle, Sino-Korean trade is only allowed with limited imports and unconditional non-exports. This is a trade policy of closing rather than opening, which is still far from the demands of overseas Chinese merchants and the barter trade between China and Korea. Under these circumstances, if strict controls are maintained, the so-called resumption of Sino-Korean trade will only be nominal rather than substantive, and how can we even talk about establishing Sino-Korean economic relations?</p>
<p>There are theoretical and factual problems with opening up trade. The restoration of Sino-Korean trade should not be equated with it or confused with it. We agree with the requests of overseas Chinese merchants in Korea: 1. Abolish the ban on imports and exports to Korea. All applications for exports or imports to Korea by overseas Chinese merchants certified by the China-Korea Trade Association, who comply with customs regulations and complete the procedures, should be approved for release to open up a path for overseas Chinese merchants. 2. Based on historical Sino-Korean trade records and with reference to current import and export trade measures, separately determine the types of goods allowed for import and export to Korea to meet the needs. Imports such as ginseng and seafood seem permissible, while coarsely made ramie cloth, mats, and large peppers seem permissible for export, so that they can be exchanged and both sides can benefit.</p>
<p>Currently, Koreans are eagerly hoping for the opening of Sino-Korean trade, and the situation of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Korea is even more precarious. In order to strengthen Sino-Korean economic relations, to relieve overseas Chinese compatriots, to safeguard their interests, and to restore Sino-Korean trade, it is indeed a current necessity!</p>

<h3>宋子文談話</h3>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Speech</h3>
<p>In his address at the handover ceremony, Song Ziwen stated: "Twenty years have passed since I left Guangdong for the Northern Expedition. I am extremely pleased to return to my hometown to serve. My future policy will focus on strengthening post-flood relief, maintaining law and order, and restoring transportation. At the same time, we will strengthen local self-defense forces and absolutely will not allow bandits to spread again. In terms of governance, we will strive to establish a clean and honest atmosphere. This time, upon returning to Guangdong, all parties have placed great expectations on the province's agricultural and industrial construction. Therefore, I sincerely hope for the joint assistance of local individuals. I welcome frank opinions on political reforms and will wholeheartedly accept them." He concluded by stating that he would "strive to ensure that compatriots in Guangdong Province can live and work in peace and contentment in the short term." The ceremony lasted fifty minutes and was completed. On this day, there were no extravagant displays inside or outside Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, nor were any firecrackers lit. Only white paper notices were posted in front of the Provincial Government, not red paper. This may be a sign of eliminating bureaucratic practices. Mr. Song did not bring anyone to Guangdong and requested that all section chiefs of the Secretariat remain in their positions. At 5 PM, Mr. Song held his first press conference after taking office in the Provincial Government Conference Room. The atmosphere was relaxed and harmonious. Mr. Song answered various questions from reporters, stating that: The Provincial Government's personnel matters were not decided in Nanjing or Shanghai, but rather he intended to seek out talented individuals locally and then recommend them to the central government for appointment. Maintaining law and order and restoring transportation are the current urgent tasks, otherwise economic construction cannot be discussed. He will study the five-year construction plan set by former Chairman Luo in detail before expressing his opinion. Regarding the issue of Hainan Island becoming a province, he has no preconceived notions and plans to study the matter with his fellow villagers in the future. Developing Hainan Island is indeed an important task, and the central government has already had concrete measures. Regarding the news of the Min[zhu] and Qing[nian] parties participating in local government, he had only seen it in the regulations and knew nothing else. He discovered that the economic crisis in Guangdong Province was more serious than before his military service. It will take ten days to break through the difficulties, and he will do his best. At the same time, he hopes for the assistance of the entire province's people.</p>
<h3>董顯光談話內容</h3>
<h3>Dong XianGuang's Speech Content</h3>
<p>The following is the long speech by Mr. Dong: "The situation of the Democratic League colluding with the Communist bandits, which I pointed out in my previous press conference, only mentioned some examples. Of course, they all have factual basis. For example: Zi, the weight of the words of evasiveness will not be trusted by anyone. Guoshi joined the Democratic League during the Democratic Political Group Alliance era, as the representative of the Northeast National Salvation General Association, and was a member of the Central Standing Committee at the same time as Zhou Enlai. Luo has already admitted this, and Zhou's appointment as a member of the administrative committee of the Northeast Communist pseudo-organization was officially announced by the bandits, which is an undeniable fact. Details can be found in the September 12th Shanghai Wenhui Daily last year. If it is not accurate, the Democratic League should have denied it long ago. Why wait until today? As for whether Zhou Jingwen is still in the Northeast now, or is traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong to run errands and liaise for the bandits, it has nothing to do with the plants he is in charge of. The government once captured a so-called 'Northeast People's Autonomous Committee' key member Luo Ziji in the Northeast, and also found a conspiracy document to organize the 'Northeast People's Autonomous Government'. Luo confessed that he was instructed by Zhou Jingwen to carry out activities in the Northeast. The examples of key members of the Democratic League holding positions in the bandit side that I cited a few days ago numbered as many as seven, and Luo Longji could only deny one, while the rest were silent. This is indeed trying to cover up the truth."</p>
<h3>民開與匪沆一氣</h3>
<h3>The Democratic League Colludes with the Bandits</h3>
<p>Luo Longji admitted that the Democratic League has organizations in the bandit areas, and that members of the Democratic League also hold positions in the bandit areas. It is common knowledge to the world that the people in the bandit areas have no freedom to speak of, and that they do not allow any individuals or political organizations other than the Communist Party and its affiliates to exist. If the Democratic League does not have a special collusion with the Communist bandits, then I really do not know how the members of the Democratic League can survive in the bandit areas. As for what Luo said that the Democratic League members who hold positions in the bandit side were all before the promulgation of the Suppression of Rebellion Mobilization Order, then after the order was issued, it has neither been heard that these Democratic League members have left the work of the bandit side, nor has the headquarters of the Democratic League announced their expulsion. And Luo and Huang both admitted that "the activities of any political party are based on the guidelines formulated by its central organ", then the Democratic League can hardly escape its responsibility for participating in the bandit side's rebellion organization. The reason is very clear.</p>
<h3>所謂中立徒托空言</h3>
<h3>The So-Called Neutrality is Empty Talk</h3>
<p>Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei have both mentioned that the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League openly called for actions to resist the government's Suppression of Rebellion General Mobilization. It is said that the headquarters of the Democratic League, according to the guidelines formulated by the Central Committee of the Democratic League, telegraphed instructions that the written conversation of Mr. Zhang BiaoFang, chairman of the Democratic League, should be the position of the Democratic League. The conversation he referred to by Zhang BiaoFang expressed his dissatisfaction with the government's Suppression of Rebellion Mobilization Order, which was not enough to show a position of transcendence and neutrality. As for this empty and meaningless grumble, I really do not understand how it can cover up the actual actions of the Southern Branch of the Democratic League to secretly organize troops to instigate rebellion. Also, as Huang Yanpei said, the Democratic League does not help the Communist Party to fight the Kuomintang, then there are so many Democratic League members participating in the pseudo-organizations of the Northeast bandits. If they are not helping the Communist bandits to fight the government, who can believe it?</p>
<h3>此後申辯不再答覆</h3>
<h3>No Further Response to Future Defenses</h3>
<p>Since the Democratic League participated in the Political Consultative Conference, it has had no independent political opinions. All it has done is follow the Communist Party step by step, which is obvious to the world. It is evident that on the eve of the National Assembly, the Democratic League once participated in the third party to put forward a more neutral peace proposal, but Luo Longji immediately withdrew it after being reprimanded by Zhou Enlai. As the Communist Party representatives withdrew from Beijing and Shanghai, the Democratic League not only inherited the industry that the CCP had left behind, but also the underground work of the CCP was entrusted to the Democratic League, which is also very obvious. The government has obtained conclusive evidence of the Democratic League's agitation of student unrest in various places and other conspiracies. In short, this matter is no longer a problem of written debate, but a question of fact. I do not intend to waste any more words on Luo's subsequent rebuttals, but will publish the facts as a response when necessary."</p>
<h3>限制使用否決權　我國建議案內容</h3>
<h3>Limiting the Use of Veto Power: Content of Our Country's Proposal</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 2nd] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly has formally submitted a draft resolution to impose procedural restrictions on the use of veto power by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Our country's proposal has been listed as an official document of the General Assembly today and distributed to all delegations for reference. Although the language is measured and attempts to avoid amending the rules of procedure of the Security Council stipulated in the Charter, the proposals listed are the most profound suggestions made so far by the five permanent members of the Security Council holding the veto power. Our proposal is divided into three parts: 1. It is recommended that the Security Council determine that certain types of resolutions are procedural matters and that the veto power cannot be used according to the Charter. 2. The five powers are urged to abandon the use of the veto power on matters of peaceful settlement of disputes. 3. The General Assembly is requested to declare that the veto power of a single country cannot cancel the obligations of the members of the Security Council to the Charter, and it is recommended that the majority of countries in the Security Council may negotiate on the implementation of such obligations, or exercise their right to convene a special session of the General Assembly when the veto power of a single country hinders the action of the Security Council. Our country's proposal is expected to be opposed by the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union firmly refuses to consider "changes in the veto power." The other three powers have not yet made any official comments. According to reliable sources, the US delegation may advocate that the Chinese proposal be submitted to a special committee for study and that a report be submitted to the General Assembly next year. Other non-official comments believe that our country's proposal may coordinate the two major extreme opinions on the veto power issue and seek a solution (one of the extreme opinions is to convene a special General Assembly to amend the Charter and abolish the veto power). Our country's proposal will not be discussed in the near future, because the veto power issue is currently being handled by the Political and Security Subcommittee. The subcommittee has many pending cases, and the relevant sections on the veto power are placed at the end of the agenda.</p>
<h3>擴大地方民意機構　參駐會提改善辦法　反對由政府遴選參護員</h3>
<h3>Expanding Local Public Opinion Institutions: Senate Standing Committee Proposes Improvement Measures, Opposing Government Selection of Senate Members</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] After the State Council approved the plan for members of the Min[zhu] and Qing[nian] parties to participate in local public opinion institutions, the Shanghai Municipal Senate raised objections, and the Nanjing Municipal Senate responded. The National Political Council Standing Committee held a meeting on the 3rd. Senators Yu Qian, Yu Nanqiu, Yin Shuxian, Wang Puhan, Wu Chunwu, Xue Mingjian, Lin Zhong, Jin Weixi, and Li Qiajiu jointly submitted a case "Requesting the Government to Improve the Measures for Expanding the Local Senate," which was unanimously considered extremely important after discussion and a resolution was made to "submit it to the government for serious attention." The case is roughly as follows: "Local public opinion institutions in various provinces and cities, except for the current Provisional Senate, have mostly established elected senates. The selection of senators did not initially pay attention to whether they were members of a party. Now, at the request of the Min and Qing parties, the National Government suddenly allows the use of selection methods to allow members of the two parties to participate. This is extremely inconsiderate. If the government discriminates against 'citizens with party affiliation' and 'citizens without party affiliation,' then the so-called public opinion is limited to citizens with party affiliation. At present, the local public opinion institutions are organized by directly elected members of the people. If selected members are inserted midway, it is equivalent to the government undermining the right of senators to recall members in the producing area. Who will recall the selected personnel? This is a laughing stock of democratic politics. It is proposed that the government formulate other appropriate measures."</p>

<h3>Hefei Rice Price Doubles</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Hefei, 3rd] In the rice-producing area of central Anhui, rice prices have skyrocketed in the past week. Rice merchants in Hefei, whose warehouses were usually full of rice, are now empty, with only a small amount available on the market. Rice prices have risen from 250,000 to 500,000, and the trend is still rising. According to the custom, this autumn is a bumper harvest in central Anhui, and rice prices should be the lowest, but now the price increase is particularly strong, and the small people are crying out to heaven.</p>

<h3>審陽各黨報調</h3>
<h3>Shenyang's Party Newspapers Adjusted</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 2nd] Although the newspaper business in the Northeast after the restoration once flourished, it has not yet been regularized. After Chen Cheng took office, he prohibited soldiers from running newspapers. Deng Wenyi, director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, came to the Northeast and rationally handled the military newspapers. This time, Li Weiguo inspected the Northeast and believed that the party newspaper organization and personnel needed to be adjusted. The reorganization started from the Zhongsu Daily. The principle was that the Zhongsu Daily was changed to the Central Daily, with Hu Gengnian as the president. The Central Daily was merged into the Heping Daily, with Zhao Yushi as the president and Jian Qunzhong as the vice president. The Xinbao was merged into the Qianjinbao, with Zhao Ximeng as the president.</p>

<h3>French Authorities in Northern Vietnam Attempt to Restore the Bangzhang System: Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Lodged a Protest</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: The French authorities in Northern Vietnam have recently sought to restore the bangzhang system. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the bangzhang system has many long-standing problems and is hated by overseas Chinese. Ambassador Qian was ordered to negotiate with the French side. The French side agreed to order the French authorities in Vietnam to temporarily postpone the election of bangzhang during the negotiations between the two sides. However, the French military commander in Ruomei Street still forced overseas Chinese to change the Chinese Association into a Bang Public Office and elected bangzhang. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently summoned the French Ambassador to China to discuss this matter and lodged a protest. The counselor urgently telegraphed to the West to stop the compulsory restoration of the bangzhang system during the Sino-French negotiations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs re-sent a note to the French ambassador on the 30th of last month, requesting that the French authorities in Vietnam strictly abide by their promise, wait for a diplomatic solution, and urgently telegraphed to stop the compulsory implementation of the bangzhang system in Ruomei Street.</p>

<h3>香港華商紡織公會　請恢復運銷優先權　上書港府轉英殖民部</h3>
<h3>Hong Kong Chinese Textile Merchants Association Requests Restoration of Sales Priority: Submits Letter to Hong Kong Government to Forward to British Colonial Office</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] The Chinese Textile Merchants Association here has submitted a letter to the Hong Kong government, in view of the current business recession, requesting the restoration of the imperial priority for Hong Kong Chinese textile products to be sold in various parts of the United Kingdom before the war, and requesting it to forward it to the London Colonial Office authorities for review. According to the letter, before the war, Hong Kong's textile industry employed more than 75,000 workers, and it was one of the most important export industries. Today, production has been greatly limited due to the high cost of machinery and raw materials, and the fierce competition from American and Japanese textiles has also made the industry suffer unfavorably.</p>

<h3>Engineers' Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>This morning's special topic discussion was divided into seven points and discussed one by one in order to focus the discussion, as the scope was too broad. The first topic raised was: "Under the current situation, what is the focus of industrial construction? How should it be coordinated with agricultural construction to save the social and economic crisis in a timely manner?" Yang Zhaoceng, Xia Guangyu, Xu Enzeng, and others spoke, emphasizing that industrial construction should maintain close ties with agricultural construction, and that the focus should be on power and water conservancy. They also pointed out that the machinery that Japan compensated China should be rationally distributed throughout the country and should be regarded as the lifeline for China's industrial revival. Members from border areas hoped that when engaging in agricultural and industrial construction, the border areas should not be ignored. They solemnly pointed out that there are many reasons for the troubles in the border areas, but the main reason is that we have no construction in these areas, which has caused the people in the border areas to develop centrifugal force due to their inclination towards the culture of other countries. Some even advocated not giving up the TVA plan.</p>
<p>The discussion then turned to the unreasonable problem of the financial sector's current policy of tightening loans to industry and mining under the pretext of preventing inflation. Xu Enzeng and others agreed with the "fixed currency method" proposed in the economic reform plan, that is, the state should lend to industry and mining and recover its finished products. In this way, on the one hand, it would support industry, and on the other hand, it would prevent loans from flowing into non-productive avenues. Shen Yi pointed out that the current economy has reached a most serious juncture, and the authorities should grant loans that are beneficial to society and sufficient to reverse the economic crisis, even if the loans may deepen inflation. Shen believes that the only goal of current construction should be to solve unemployment, so that those who are unemployed can find employment, and those who are employed can enjoy their work. This engineering expert, who is now the mayor of Nanjing, also used his own experience to criticize the tax law, saying: "It is a tragedy of the times that young people seek a way out by entering the officialdom." Gu Yuzhen put forward four points: 1. The economic crisis should not be remedied by patching up, but should be reformed. 2. Economic views should be centered on materials, not measured by legal tender. 3. Economic strongholds are military strongholds, and the military authorities should pay attention to economic strongholds. 4. Production should be coordinated, and consumption should be coordinated. Xia Guangyu further emphasized the importance of transportation in the economy and national defense, hoping that the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether industrial construction should first select one or two relatively safe locations, concentrate all efforts on development, and then extend to other regions, or whether it should be developed in a decentralized manner, opinions in the meeting were clearly divided into two factions. Those who advocated developing in safe areas cited the destructive power of the atomic bomb as an example. Those who opposed it believed that industrial construction has various necessary conditions such as raw materials, transportation, and sales channels, and should not overemphasize safety and affect production.</p>
<p>The discussion then turned to how to absorb idle capital and overseas Chinese capital to engage in production, and how to use foreign capital. Regarding encouraging overseas investment in industrial construction, it was generally believed that the tendency of capital to hoard and profiteer, the unrest in the situation, the government's lack of a fixed policy for industry, and the lack of guarantees for industry were all related. All of these should be remedied. Xia Guangyu also suggested establishing regional design agencies in various regions to assist the work of the National Economic Commission. Zhong Jin, the inventor of the Chinese typewriter, based on his experience in the United States, proposed three points on the use of foreign capital and cooperation with foreign technology: 1. The use of foreign high-speed machinery technology has economic value. 2. The United States is the world's parts factory. 3. The state should concentrate its purchasing power in the domestic market. When Mr. Gao took the stage, the entire venue responded with warm applause, and the meeting did not end until 12:30.</p>
<p>Capital Construction Discussion</p>
<p>A special topic discussion was held at 2:00 pm, presided over by Shen Yi, titled "Basic Conditions for Promoting Capital Construction." Shen first proposed seven key points and expressed his views on the point "Why has capital construction failed to develop smoothly in the past?" Shen said: Since the city was established as the capital in 1927 and the Capital Construction Commission was established in 1929, it has been 20 years, and its construction has not developed as quickly as desired. Reviewing the reasons, there are three main categories: 1. General, the frequent military affairs in the country since the establishment of the capital, and the recent impact of domestic political economy. 2. Technical, such as the incomplete urban planning and the incomplete determination of construction procedures, which make the entire construction lack a basis for implementation and are limited to treating the symptoms. 3. Political, the lack of funding for construction, the inability of institutions to be dedicated, and the heavy overlap of general administrative procedures, making capital construction proceed amidst various constraints and difficult to achieve great success. Zhao Zukang, Lu Yuzheng, and others then spoke, and Tan Bingxun and four others were appointed to be responsible for the competition, convened by Shen Yi.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Various engineering societies held engineering conferences. In addition to the 26 papers from the two professional societies of municipal administration and sanitation, which were announced at 2:00 pm on the 4th, the rest were held on the afternoon of the 3rd, presided over by Wu Chengluo. Each group appointed a person in charge to serve as chairman. The papers included 4 from the Transportation Engineering Society, 22 from the Civil Engineering Society, 8 from the Hydraulic Engineering Society, 1 from the Architectural Engineering Society, 9 from the Mechanical Engineering Society, 10 from the Electrical Engineering Society, 8 from the Aviation Engineering Society, 7 from the Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society, and 3 from the Textile Engineering Society. After the papers from each professional society were announced, they will select several of the best, and the authors and topics will be announced at the general meeting on the 4th.</p>
<p>At 8:00 pm on the 3rd, an engineering lecture was held, presided over by Gu Yuxian. Chen Zhongzhou, Xu Benchun, and Wu Xuezhou respectively lectured on the electrical, mining, and steel machinery industries in Northeast China. Member Gao Zhongqin lectured on the design and application of the electric Chinese typewriter.</p>
<p>The 4th is the third day. The morning is still for special topics, presided over by Wu Hongxun, titled "Reviewing the Obstacles to Construction Imposed by the Current System." In the afternoon, the two engineering societies of municipal administration and sanitation read papers, and the general meeting began discussing meeting affairs. In the evening, an engineering lecture was given, titled "Destruction and Restoration of National Railways."</p>

<h3>Discussing the Disposition of Former Italian Colonial Territories London Conference Opens Yesterday Egypt Submits Memorandum to the Four Powers</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd] Sir Charles Peake, the British representative, presided over the opening of the Four-Power Conference on Italian Colonies here on the 3rd. He called for the rapid establishment of a Four-Power Commission to determine the wishes of the people of the colonies regarding their future political situation. Peake said that he did not see "any serious difficulty in this matter" and that "it must be easy to reach an agreement on a preliminary detailed plan." Peake did not say that the commission should be able to send representatives to Africa for inspection by November 15.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Italian diplomats here are pessimistic about an early resolution of the former Italian colonies. They expect that the final resolution of the Italian territories will have to wait two years, with most of the time spent studying the local situation and investigating the opinions of the residents. They also expect that the Italian government's opinion will not be sought in the initial stages of the talks held outside the Four Powers, but they expect Rome to send experts to London to provide temporary opinions.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] On the eve of the start of discussions on Italian territories by the special representatives of the foreign ministers of the Four Powers, the Egyptian government submitted a memorandum to the four countries of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, stating Egypt's views on this issue. In addition to supporting the demands of other Arab League countries to make Libya, with an area of 600,000 square miles, an independent Arab state, it also has some specific demands of its own for North Africa. The content has not yet been revealed. At the same time, Italian diplomatic sources here revealed that Italy hopes to be able to entrust the trusteeship of its former territories to it, so as to protect the lives of the 200,000 Italians who currently live there. The Allied countries can also show that they value Italy's money and manpower spent in developing these virgin lands over the past sixty years.</p>
<h3>Greece, Turkey, and Arab Countries Brewing Mediterranean Alliance Arab Proposes Egyptian Trusteeship of Italian Territories in North Africa</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 2nd] After returning here today from London and New York, Arab League Secretary-General Azzam received reporters and gave a speech, mentioning the possibility of uniting Greece, Turkey, and Arab League countries, and possibly adding Italy, to form a Mediterranean alliance. He said that the Arab League has not yet considered this proposal, but he personally believes that for the sake of peace, it is in favor of establishing a strong buffer between the two major ideologies. He believes that if this proposal can promote the maintenance of peace and eliminate the threat of new wars, no one will oppose the establishment of the Mediterranean Alliance. When Azzam mentioned the issue of Italian colonies, he expressed his disbelief that the Four Powers could reach an agreement on this matter, and declared that the Arabs would oppose the return of these lands to Italy. The Arabs and Italians have been fighting for twenty years, and allowing the Italians to return to their territories is tantamount to crowding out the Arabs who fought with the Allied countries. He also reiterated the Arab League's policy, which advocates the unification of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, and entrusts them to Egypt for trusteeship if necessary.</p>
<h3>US Secretary of Defense Responds to Vyshinsky Says US Business Community Does Not Want War</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] Secretary of Defense Forrestal declared last night that "the American business community does not want war, and neither does American labor." This statement was clearly in response to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's accusation at the United Nations General Assembly that a part of the American people were "merchants of war." Forrestal also said that the Marxist idea that industrialists are conspiring to brew a new war is nonsense. In fact, the American business community is investing in peace. In the past twenty months, American businesses have invested more than $20 billion in new factories, new stores, new public utilities, new transportation businesses, and new miners. This kind of production and distribution business specializes in manufacturing peacetime goods, and is intended for supplying the people of the country and exporting them to the world, and is not intended for manufacturing munitions.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Relations Expected to Improve Stassen Urges Soviet Union to Change Attitude</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] New York, 4th Radio: San Diego dispatch, Republican presidential candidate Stassen told reporters today that US-Soviet relations are expected to improve. The Soviet Union will understand that capitalism has not failed in the United States, that Soviet secret agents have failed to infiltrate the United States, and that the United States has sufficient military power. After understanding the above points, the Soviet Union will change its attitude towards the United States and try to change the relations between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Taft Harshly Condemns US Government's Connivance with Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Casper, Wyoming, USA, 2nd] Republican Senator Taft delivered his last campaign speech in the western states here today, criticizing the Democratic government's indecisiveness and lack of principles in handling domestic and foreign affairs. The State Department is disorganized and prone to infighting. He also said that he could not believe whether the government's policy was tending towards peace or war. In the past year, the State Department's actions have not followed a consistent line. On the one hand, it connives with the Chinese Communist Party, but on the other hand, it takes strong measures in Greece and Turkey. The State Department is so chaotic and contradictory that it still refuses to announce all the facts to the people or Congress.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, 3rd] Former Vice President Wallace declared here last night, "It is unwise for intelligent people like Taft to oppose the International Relief Plan, and it is even more shocking. Any 20th-century American who believes that it is impossible to maintain and improve the living standards of countries around the world is even more unimaginable."</p>
<h3>UN Committee Debates Greek Issue Ukraine Criticizes Britain and the United States Representatives of Bulgaria and Albania Attend to Defend</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] New York, 4th Radio: Lake Success dispatch, The UN Political Committee met today to continue debating the Greek issue. The first speaker was the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky, who said, "The whole world knows that British troops are stationed in Greece, while Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania do not have a single soldier within Greek territory. The United States' accusations against the above three countries are clearly unfounded and purely lies. It must be known that the Greek civil war occurred because the British army supported the reactionary government and oppressed democratic elements."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 2nd] The UN Political Committee resumed its debate on the Greek issue today. Bulgarian representative Mivra accused the US government of deliberately using UN agencies to conceal its ambition to expand into the Balkans and the Near East. Mivra also criticized the report of the UN Balkan Investigation Committee, denying that Bulgaria had assisted the Greek guerrillas with weapons, money, or armed personnel. The Albanian representative then took the floor, accusing the Greek government of being fully responsible for creating tension between neighboring countries.</p>
<h3>Poland to Propose Abolition of Germ Warfare</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] It is reported that Poland will soon ask the United Nations to ban germ warfare, which is engaged in mass slaughter, because this war is more terrible and more difficult to control than the atomic bomb. It is said that this move will cause a wide response in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, because if the commission meets, the negotiations on this matter will be conducted in the commission.</p>
<p>In addition to making the commission a more intense battlefield than atomic control, germ warfare negotiations have a significant impact on the global balance of power, because this matter is of great importance to the deadlock caused by the issue of atomic energy between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. The United States apparently now has a monopoly on atomic energy and occupies a leading position in atomic negotiations. The situation is different for germ weapons. Every country has this weapon. Only a small bottle is enough to kill half of the world's population. It has long been no secret that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries had already produced methods of using germs to slaughter humans, livestock, and plants by the end of this war. The Soviet Union is lagging behind in this regard, and it is also a fact.</p>
<h3>Palestine Committee Listens to Jewish Opinions</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] Jewish Public Council of Palestine Representative Shertok, speaking today at the UN Palestine Committee, stated that the partition of Palestine, which is necessary for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the region, means that the Jews are prepared to reluctantly accept the partition plan. But this solution requires considerable promotion by UN agencies, and the establishment of a UN international institution to supervise the partition of Palestine between the Arabs and Jews for a period of two years. According to an Arab spokesperson, no agreement was reached in the committee regarding any solution to partitioning, and Palestine should establish an independent and democratic Arab state, and the Arabs will fight to the end for their principles. Disputes also broke out at today's meeting, and it seems that there is no compromise on the positions of the Arabs and Jews.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Arabs Strike to Protest Partition Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 3rd] Palestinian Arabs held a general strike on the 3rd to protest the UN's partition proposal. 100,000 people participated in the strike, and no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Hull's Condition Improving</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Former Secretary of State Hull celebrated his 76th birthday at the Bethesda Naval Hospital on the 2nd. It is reported that Hull's recent condition is better than at any time this year.</p>
<h3>After Meeting Truman, Bidault Says France Faces Major Crisis Existing Dollars Will Be Exhausted by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] After holding a 35-minute talk with President Truman at the White House, French Foreign Minister Bidault issued a statement saying that France would not have the dollars needed to purchase necessary goods from the United States by November 1 of this year.</p>
<p>France's situation has become extremely critical, and new sources of dollars must be found in November and December, otherwise the French government will have to issue new restrictions to strictly limit the purchase of necessary wheat, coal, and industrial raw materials from the United States. Bidault also said that the 93 million dollars worth of German gold allocated by the Brussels Committee can only be maintained for a very short period of time and is not enough to alleviate the urgency of France's dollar needs.</p>
<h3>International Tariff Negotiations to End on the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] Executive Secretary Wyatt of the Preparatory Committee of the International Trade Organization told reporters that the international tariff negotiations in Geneva could end on October 15. The participating countries recognized that in the current environment, there is a need to continue to adopt restrictive measures. Therefore, it is tentatively scheduled to adopt a quota import system before March 1950 to protect nascent industries and countries that are difficult to balance their income and expenditure. Countries such as China, India, Australia, and Brazil are strongly advocating maintaining the quota system.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Resume Soon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 2nd] The government revealed on the 2nd that it has completed the prelude to reopening British-Soviet negotiations for a large-scale exchange of machinery and manufactured goods for Soviet wheat. Some speculate that although the Soviet Union claims to have had a bumper harvest this year, it may still not be able to export large quantities of wheat. According to the previous British-Soviet trade talks in Moscow, although the representatives of both sides considered them to be fruitless, the United Kingdom extended them for political reasons.</p>
<h3>Italian Political Situation Eases General Strike in Rome Avoidable</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] Undersecretary of the Interior Maraiche tonight declared that the general strike in Rome Province tomorrow can be avoided.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] The Labor Union, under the wing of the Communist Party, decided to postpone the launch of the general strike in Rome thirty minutes before the midnight deadline on the 2nd, and at the same time consider the government's urgent call to cancel the strike of 200,000 workers. However, 30,000 squatters have occupied private land for eleven days, and there is still no sign that government mediators can resolve the dispute between landowners and squatters.</p>

<h3>Obstructing Resumption of Work and Destroying Trams: Ninety-Six Workers Arrested, Thirty-Eight Innocents Released, Four Thugs Handed Over to the Garrison Command, Tram Depot Nearly Attacked but Prevented by Suppression, Armed Protection Restores First Tram</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The French-owned tram workers' strike has dragged on for a week today. This morning, most employees obeyed orders and went to the tram depot to prepare to resume work. The Labor Union Readjustment Committee dispatched tram No. 17F at 8:00 AM, driven by Sun Jinxiang (Shandong native, 21 years old, residing at No. 23 Wangjia Lane, Daxilu), an unemployed worker of the British-owned tram company assigned by the Social Affairs Bureau, to pick up workers to resume work. Three policemen were assigned on the tram. While passing near the Navy Club at the intersection of Chongqing South Road and Ximen Road, suddenly over a hundred striking workers from Fuxing Park rushed out, armed with iron rulers and stones, and blocked the tram, smashing all the glass windows and severely beating Sun Jinxiang, causing injuries to his face and internal injuries. At that time, workers preparing to go to the depot to resume work were arriving one after another. Seeing the chaotic situation, they panicked and scattered to take cover. Meanwhile, the striking workers who had been lying in wait around the tram depot near Xujiahui Road and the post office on Jianguo West Road took the opportunity to gather and planned to rush to the company and depot. Over a hundred police officers from the 3rd squadron of the 1st police regiment, stationed at the depot for protection, were dispatched to suppress the unrest. At the same time, after receiving the report, the Police Headquarters immediately dispatched Garrison Section Chief Lu Dagong in a garrison vehicle, and twenty mounted patrol officers were also dispatched. Simultaneously, the Songshan and Lujiawan Police Stations also dispatched a large number of police officers to encircle and arrest suspected rioting workers. Ninety-six workers were arrested at the scene. Fifty-two of them were detained by the Songshan Police Station, and forty-four were detained by the Lujiawan Police Station. The surrounding area was placed under martial law, and traffic was cut off. Order was restored around 10:00 AM. Sun Jinxiang, who was injured, was sent to the hospital for treatment and then returned home to recuperate.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu went to the Lujiawan branch office to inquire about the incident. Branch Chief Chen Zhiqing gave a detailed account of what happened. Commander Xuan advised that, unless absolutely necessary, conciliatory measures should be used first. After a detailed interrogation of the arrestees that afternoon, it was found that eighteen workers detained by the Songshan Police Station and twenty workers detained by the Lujiawan Police Station were innocent. They were all going to the company to resume work and were arrested in the chaos. After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Labor Union provided proof to the police station, they were successively released on bail and ordered to return to the depot to resume work. Among them, four people were identified by the police officers present at the scene as having been involved in the assault. Because the circumstances were more serious, they were transferred to the Garrison Command's military court for investigation. The four people were: Zhao Niangen (17 years old, Shanghai native, Electricity Department). Li Guifu (26 years old, Longhua native, Repair Department). Yao Runquan (31 years old, Wujin native, Repair Department). Yu Guishi (26 years old, Zhenjiang native, Driver). The remaining fifty-four people detained by the police station are still under investigation.</p>
<p>Due to the obstruction, the French-owned trams were unable to leave the depot yesterday morning. The workers who were originally scheduled to resume work scattered in fright and were difficult to reassemble. The Labor Union Readjustment Committee was still actively seeking to restore transportation in the afternoon. At 4:10 PM, the first tram was dispatched, running between the Bund and Xujiahui, driven by an unemployed worker assigned by the Social Affairs Bureau, with armed police protection. Jeeps and motorcycles from the Garrison Command provided protection along the way. Subsequently, a total of thirteen trams on Route 2 were successively dispatched, returning to the depot at 9:00 PM. According to the Labor Union, it is planned to increase the number of operating trams to twenty today, departing from the depot at 5:00 AM. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian explained that the reason for only operating Route 2 was that the section between the Bund and Xujiahui has always been the main artery of the former French Concession, so maintaining transportation on that route was given priority. Other tram and trolleybus routes, as well as buses, will be restored as soon as workers resume work.</p>
<p>Regarding Sun Jinxiang, who was beaten and injured, Director Wu stated yesterday that the government had already sent his family a living allowance of five million yuan, and all medical expenses would also be borne by the government.</p>

<h3>Mayor Angrily Orders: Any Further Obstruction or Assault Will Result in On-the-Spot Execution</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu met with reporters in the Municipal Government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on the incident where over a hundred rioters obstructed the French-owned trams yesterday morning. He stated that the company and workers had requested the Social Affairs Bureau to extend the deadline for resuming work, and the municipal government has now approved the extension until 4:00 PM today. Anyone who has not resumed work by 4:00 PM this afternoon will be unconditionally dismissed. The French-owned tram company has scheduled to start registering new workers at 10:00 AM this morning. It is sincerely hoped that well-meaning workers will come to their senses in time.</p>
<p>Regarding the incident yesterday of rioters obstructing the tram: Mayor Wu was extremely angry and issued another order yesterday: "From now on, anyone who obstructs vehicles or assaults drivers will be executed on the spot without exception."</p>
<p>Government Attitude</p>
<p>Mayor Wu finally declared: "The ninety-six people arrested yesterday morning for obstructing the tram are being interrogated separately. Some are colluding with wanted criminals and will be dealt with according to military law. Those who were coerced into participating will also be charged with disrupting transportation and will be sent to court for prosecution. The government's attitude towards this labor strike is that public transportation cannot be disrupted for even a moment, and workers should consider the public interest. If workers have demands, they should formally apply to the authorities for mediation. If mediation fails, then arbitration should be used. Terrorist threats and other behaviors are not allowed. If subversive elements take the opportunity to stir up trouble, they will be dealt with according to the Central Government's measures for dealing with the Communist bandits."</p>
<h3>Worker Registration for Resumption of Work Extended to Today</h3>

All dismissed employees will be treated as voluntarily resigning, and all preferential treatment such as dismissal and retirement benefits will be canceled.</p>
<h3>Deploying Military Police to Protect Workers</h3>
<p>In response to inquiries from workers' families about whether there would be effective guarantees after the workers resumed work, Mayor Wu resolutely stated that in order to maintain transportation and protect the jobs of well-meaning workers, the police will do their best to protect the workers who resume work and their families. If necessary, they will also be authorized to open fire on those who endanger the resumption of work. In addition, Commander Xuan has been requested to order the army and all military and police in the city to be deployed to provide protection.</p>
<h3>Registration and Recruitment of New Workers</h3>
<p>The company will begin registering new workers starting at 10:00 AM on the 4th, with the assistance of the labor union and the protection of the government. Registration for recruiting new workers will continue until the quota is filled. The company raised the question of who would be responsible for the medical expenses and family living expenses of injured workers. It was decided to handle the workers in two categories. The first category is workers who resume work for the company. If they are injured, their medical expenses will be borne by the company. The living expenses of their families during the recovery period will also be borne by the company. The second category is workers assigned by the government who have not yet completed hiring procedures. If they are injured, their medical expenses and family living expenses will be borne by the government.

<h3>Wounded Soldiers Cause Disturbance at North Station: Shanghai-Hangzhou Night Train Delayed, Windows and Tables Smashed, First-Class Passengers Evicted</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] When the 27th express train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway departed from the North Station at 10 PM the night before last, it was suddenly obstructed by 120 wounded soldiers from a rear hospital in Qingdao, who were planning to transfer to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Shanghai. The wounded soldiers complained that the third-class accommodations were inadequate and demanded to be moved to first-class. Stationmaster Zhang Xin-gao, accompanied by Staff Officer Li from the Military Transportation Department, went to the platform to investigate. The wounded soldiers felt threatened by the presence of armed personnel and found their attitude arrogant, leading to a conflict. Deputy Director Lu Yi-xin and railway policeman Gao Zhen-peng were injured. The soldiers then stormed the stationmaster's office, smashing the glass and writing desk. Subsequently, they evicted the passengers from the first-class carriages of the 27th train and occupied them themselves. To maintain the train schedule, the railway bureau proceeded with the departure, resulting in a 47-minute delay upon arrival in Hangzhou. After arriving in Hangzhou, the wounded soldiers in the first and second-class carriages disembarked and transferred to the third-class carriages, requesting to continue on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway on the same train. However, since the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines are not directly connected, the railway bureau could not comply. It was forced to abandon three third-class carriages and return to Shanghai (as train No. 24). Due to the time spent on transfers and negotiations, the arrival in Shanghai was delayed by 1 hour and 37 minutes.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Great Structure: Monument to Victory in the War of Resistance: Symbolizes Our Country's Infinite Bright Future. Grand Opening Ceremony Scheduled for Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>[Reported from Chongqing, September 30th, by our newspaper] Chongqing – this wartime capital – is not only a strategically important city in southwestern China but also the command post that accomplished the great historical mission of leading eight years of bloody resistance to achieve victory. It was once honored as the "World Peace Lighthouse." The Monument to Victory in the War of Resistance on Minquan Road (formerly Duyou Street) is the only structure of historical significance. Its predecessor – the spiritual fortress of wartime – represents the spirit of the Chinese nation's inevitable victory in the war of resistance. Now, it symbolizes our country's great and bright future in building the nation after victory.</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The preliminary preparations were as follows: On October 31st of the year before the victory of the War of Resistance, in honor of President Chiang Kai-shek's 60th birthday, all sectors of the wartime capital initiated a monetary gift. Mayor Zhang Rui-lun, considering that our leader led the entire nation through eight years of arduous resistance to achieve victory and complete a monumental achievement, proposed, in order to commemorate this tragic history of national rejuvenation and to honor the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed their lives for the country, to use all the monetary gifts to build this "Monument to Merit" and establish the Victory Merit Monument Construction Committee, based on President Chiang's instructions in December of the 34th year of the Republic for a ten-year construction plan for the wartime capital. The project's budget was set at 500 million yuan for construction costs and 50 million yuan for equipment. Huang Bin-xun, Standing Committee Member of the Urban Construction Planning Committee, and specialist Liu Da-ren were responsible for planning. Architect Li Lun-jie from the committee designed the monument, and civil engineers Li Ji-fen, architects Tang Ben-shan, Zhang Zhi-fan, Guo Min-zhan, and others assisted. Electrical engineer Li Zong-yue handled the electrical equipment. The Tianfu Construction Factory won the bid for the construction project. Mayor Zhang presided over the groundbreaking ceremony on October 31st of the 35th year of the Republic, with the entire project scheduled for completion in eight months. The arduous work was carried out under conditions of scarcity of materials in the mountainous city. In order to economize due to economic constraints, the actual construction cost amounted to 188.3 million yuan and equipment costs totaled 19 million yuan. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of this month. It is reported that it has been decided to hold the grand opening ceremony on Double Tenth Day this year. It is also learned that at the beginning of the ceremony, the municipal government will borrow 200 homing pigeons from the Central Police Academy in Chongqing, with colored paper strips tied to their feet, flying into the sky to create a magnificent spectacle. This initiative is also an unheard-of anecdote.</p>
<p>Great Appearance</p>
<p>The design of the Victory Monument is a high-rise octagonal tower, divided into a base, a pedestal, a body, and an observation deck. The entire monument is built on Duyou Street Square. Excluding the median strip and sidewalks, the area is a circle with a diameter of 20 meters. The base of the monument, with its granite and stone steps, forms a circle with a radius of 10.5 meters. The green stone platform is 1.6 meters high and includes flower beds on the steps. Pedestal: There are eight stone tablets made of high-quality Gorges stone produced in Beibei, inscribed with President Chiang's magnificent achievements and the epic of the eight-year War of Resistance. Eight cylindrical stone-carved pillars form the pedestal, with the stone tablets embedded on the outside. Body: The height is 24 meters, consisting of a cylindrical structure with a diameter of 4 meters. The interior is circular, and the exterior is octagonal. Each corner is paved with beige facing bricks. Inside, a cantilevered spiral staircase of 140 steps leads directly to the observation deck. Along the spiral staircase is the Victory Corridor of the War of Resistance, adorned with oil paintings of war heroes, great battles, and the Japanese surrender. Below, memorial stones donated by various cities and stone tablets donated by social celebrities are embedded. Observation Deck: Wider than the base, with a diameter of 4.5 meters, it can accommodate 20 visitors. The monument features a standard clock visible from all four sides, with four relief sculptures around the clock depicting the meritorious deeds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and electrical engineers who contributed to the war effort and the productive labor of farmers and workers in the rear. The relief sculptures are made of reinforced concrete with a bronze color. The top of the observation deck is equipped with a weather vane, anemometer, compass, and related meteorological instruments. A large bell is suspended at the top for citywide celebrations, gatherings, or alarms.</p>
<p>Solid Construction</p>
<p>The entire structure is built with steel-reinforced concrete, with the exterior finished with white cement terrazzo. Each side has five windows, all with steel-reinforced concrete window grilles that have undergone air-raid protection treatment. As for the electrical equipment, it is divided into internal and external lighting. The internal lighting includes eight mercury solar lamps surrounding the top of the monument and one mercury lamp in each section. The external lighting consists of eight powerful searchlights projecting onto the monument from all directions, revealing the entire structure in eight soft beams of light. According to architect Tang Lun-jie, the monument, barring major external damage, should last for at least 300 years. Its solidity is comparable to that of a fortress, impervious to 500-pound bombs. The monument is bulletproof. The main door on the front of the monument is made of specially selected fine camphor wood. The entire monument used 25 tons of steel and over 900 barrels of cement. The architectural design is purely modern and mixed, making it China's only great memorial building of this scale, an unparalleled spectacle even for emerging buildings in the future.</p>
<p>Beacon of Light</p>
<p>In the fundraising for the construction, there were donations ranging from as little as 2,000 yuan to as much as hundreds of thousands of yuan, but they represented the hearts of millions of citizens and the collective crystallization of the arduous and unyielding struggle of the entire nation for eight years. It is the vanguard against aggression, the bastion against fascism. It has engraved for us the humiliation China has endured throughout its history, leading to a complete removal of this humiliation and leaping to become one of the nations leading the world towards peace. From afar, its solemn and dignified exterior and the grandeur of its architecture, with the soft yellow color reflecting the blue of the sky, demonstrate the sincerity, perseverance, and indomitable spirit of this nation with over 5,000 years of history. Finally, justice triumphed over might, and the dawn of peace arrived. Democracy could be maintained, and human justice could be upheld. It leaves an indelible impression on people. This Chongqing, known as the "World Peace Lighthouse," with its only historically significant Monument to Victory in the War of Resistance, will always stand so solemnly, like a giant standing tall, recounting to the nation a glorious history page of blood and tears. It has blown the horn of harmony that resonates with world peace and justice, calling on compatriots across the country to "Advance! Advance!" towards the great road of democracy and light!

<h3>Ministry of Education Improves Comic Strips - Adopts Eight Steps Based on Research by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation - Coordinates with the Central Cultural Movement Committee to Promote Improvements in a Planned Manner</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] In order to improve comic strips as social education material, the Ministry of Education instructed the National Institute for Compilation and Translation to formulate measures for improving comic strips. Currently, based on the institute's research results, the following steps are being adopted: There must be a dedicated editorial and review organization to handle the matter with full effort and seriousness. The prohibition measures should be greatly relaxed, and only the most harmful content should be deleted or prohibited. Stories of gods and heroes should not be rashly prohibited simply because they are considered superstitious. Select famous works that are more interesting to serve as the basis for comic strips. Establish contact with the original comic strip artists and provide them with the newly selected source material for their reference. Utilize existing distribution channels. Provide assistance to publishers, such as allocating paper and providing revolving funds. Encourage new artists to participate in this work. Once a large quantity of new, high-quality comics are published, the old, poorly made comics will naturally disappear without the need for prohibition. Items 4, 5, and 6 above are currently being piloted by the Institute for Compilation and Translation, and results are expected in the short term. Because the Central Cultural Movement Committee is also very concerned about this matter, the Ministry of Education has sent a letter requesting the institute to coordinate with them to promote improvements in a planned manner, in order to achieve effective results.</p>

<h3>Measures for the Payment of Principal and Interest on Various Foreign Currency Public Bonds Abroad - Have Been Formulated by the Ministry of Finance and Implemented Immediately</h3>

The measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>[Another dispatch] It is reported that after the revision of the foreign exchange control measures, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the payment of principal and interest on foreign currency public bonds should be converted into national currency at the exchange rate quoted by designated banks in Shanghai on the payment date.

<p>It is also reported that the interest to be paid has also been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance and should be paid based on the price quoted by the designated banks in Shanghai on the same day.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Turn from Weak to Stable, Yongsha Rises Near Closing</h3>
<p>The exchange of national banks was very high, and people's hearts suddenly improved. Then, the legend of the Securities Finance Company arose again, and the buying boom continued, gradually increasing. Near the closing, Yongsha even ended at a high price.</p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>Slightly stable. Yongsha was sold to 266 yuan in deferred delivery after opening. At this time, Yongsha for immediate delivery was quite firm and rose back to 262 yuan for immediate delivery and 271 yuan for deferred delivery. The cloth market reported good sales, and the offshore interest rate opened low to 2 jiao, 2 and a half jiao, and 2 jiao 7. After 11:00 AM, it was even lower to 264 and a half yuan. As there were separate settlements, the existing delivery of Yongsha slightly recovered, but the pressure from large investors was high, and small and miscellaneous stocks were doubly weak. Near the closing, the price was forced down to 252 yuan for immediate delivery and 261 yuan for deferred delivery, and the market closed at prices of 252 and a half yuan and 262 yuan. Xinhua Zhongfang fell a lot, and Xin'a fell to the limit. As a result, compared with the previous closing price of immediate delivery stocks, Yongsha, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Xinguang, Zhongfa, Zhabei, Zhongsi, and Liana were slightly lower, Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Innerwear, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Hengfeng were half a percent lower, Xinhua Zhongfang fell 10%, Xin'a fell to the limit, and Commerce and Match, and Zhongxing were flat. Deferred delivery stocks Jingfu and Qinxing fell half a percent, Yongsha, Xinhuo, Meiya, and Xinguang fell slightly, and Huafeng was flat.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market</p>
<p>Continuing the aftermath of the closing in the afternoon, it has stabilized. There were many buyers after the opening. The cloth market and the Hong Kong exchange rate helped to buy. It was rumored that the Securities Finance Company would improve from the next period onwards. The market rose continuously. Yongsha closed at a high price of 269 yuan for immediate delivery and 274 and a half yuan for deferred delivery. The bidding was slightly higher after the closing.

<h3>Foreign Stocks Steady, Unified Bonds Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks remained steady yesterday. Interest from all parties was focused on rubber stocks. There was limited trading in mature stocks, and the price fluctuations were small. Securities banks had supply, and Guang banks bought slightly. Jardine opened at 129,000 in the morning and closed at a high price of 130,500 yuan in the afternoon. Compared with the previous closing, Wheelock and Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Wharf fell slightly, Telephone was flat, and the remaining stocks rose slightly.</p>
<p>Public bonds were suspended yesterday because there were problems with the 500,000 notes of Unified B at Room 550, and industry is working to resolve it.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks in the previous market were still turbulent amidst the labor unrest. There was little trading, and the market remained depressed, continuing to show low prices. Yarn and cloth were popular again, so the Guang bank and a certain foreign bank suspended trading for one day. The black market price of Unified B was still around 16,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Stable Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 12,600 shi of rice arrived at the North and South markets combined. The South market started firm but then relaxed, resulting in stable japonica rice prices, while indica rice rose slightly by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. White glutinous new japonica rice prices were steady. The North market was initially weak but then strengthened, with indica rice showing strength and japonica rice softening, and white glutinous rice remaining average.</p>
<p>Flour was initially weak but then tightened. Factory flour remained similar, but both standard flour and mixed-brand flour decreased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Imported flour was scarce and easy to sell, and the market remained strong. Flour allocation needs to be decided today. Bran sales were average and uneventful, with a slight decrease of 300 to 500 yuan. Soybean cakes and soybean oil showed no movement, gradually declining downstream, with a sharp drop of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Both yellow soybeans and soybean cakes fell in price, and factories showed no interest in buying. Retail sales were average, and the market trend softened.</p>
<p>Mung beans had low supply and demand, and the situation was mediocre. Broad beans saw slow sales and remained unchanged for now. Field peas from Southeast Asia were slightly sought after, and the market remained firm. Wheat remained firm, while red sorghum saw weak demand, with prices apparently steady but secretly weakening. Corn digestion was sluggish, and prices fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame seeds had abundant supply but slow sales, with prices decreasing by 10,000 yuan. New and old sesame kernels moved in opposite directions. New goods from out-of-town merchants were still acceptable, with prices remaining firm at 10,000 yuan, while old goods saw weak demand.</p>
<p>The oil market had both firm and weak aspects. Crude oil remained firm due to high prices in production areas. Soybean oil and refined oil both saw a slight rebound of 10,000 yuan, while rapeseed oil was short of buyers, with a sharp drop of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Sesame oil also fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine Rises</p>
<p>Chinese medicine was affected by the high foreign exchange rates. Goods from Southeast Asian islands became more expensive, leading to an increase in the price of pepper to 85,000 yuan per jin, crude Shanxi fennel to 8,000 yuan, old-grade frankincense to 120,000 yuan, and Indian-grade frankincense also rising to 50,000 yuan. After the increase in freight charges, Sichuan and Hubei goods, Xihuai goods, Guandong and Northern goods, Yangguang goods, as well as local products from nearby areas, were all greatly affected.

<h3>China Farmers Bank Allocates Autumn Cocoon Funds; Over 94 Billion Reached</h3>
<p>The autumn cocoon loan arranged by the China Farmers Bank under orders has reached 94.855 billion yuan in remittances from the bank to date. This includes 59.287 billion yuan for Jiangsu Province and 35.568 billion yuan for Zhejiang Province. The actual loan amounts disbursed in the cocoon-producing areas of the two provinces are currently being compiled, and although not yet fully sent to Shanghai, it is expected that the total loan amount disbursed will be less than the amount remitted. The main reason for this is that the autumn weather this year has been hot and dry, resulting in sparse moisture in the mulberry leaves, and the active grasshoppers have affected the autumn cocoon harvest. In addition, rising rice prices have made it easier for silkworm farmers to turn their fresh cocoons into homemade silk. According to government regulations, the purchase price of fresh cocoons is 1.08 million yuan per dan (based on a standard of 460 jin for reeling quality and 300 jin for drying quality). Manufacturers add an additional 340,000 yuan per dan for expenses, for a total of 1.42 million yuan, while the purchase price for manufacturing homemade silk is much higher than this amount. It is reported that before the government had approved the purchase price, manufacturers were paying high prices to snap up cocoons in order to save time, and the government will not recognize this difference. To compensate for the factory's losses, the Design Committee under the Silk Production and Marketing Coordination Council previously discussed the matter, and it is expected that this issue will be decided at the Coordination Council meeting this morning (the 4th).</p>
<h3>Export-Import Management Committee: Heads of District Offices Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The candidates for the heads of district offices of the Export-Import Management Committee have all been determined.

The Chongqing District Office will be headed by Yang Xiaobo, the Tianjin District Office by Sun Mingzhe, the Qingdao District Office by Kong Shi'e, the Taiwan District Office by Yan Jiagan, and the Northeast District Office by Li Tailai.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Dollar Weak; Black Market Exchange Rate Lower Than Official Rate</h3>
<p>The exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar against the legal tender has been adjusted several times in the past three months, from 40 yuan to 44 yuan, 51 yuan, 65 yuan, and finally 72 yuan. However, despite repeated adjustments, the local demand for legal tender has increased, and there is still a shortage of cash, so the black market exchange rate is lower than the official rate. This is because local merchants are absorbing legal tender to purchase smuggled imports from South China, and they also need legal tender to apply for foreign exchange to order goods from abroad, which once caused remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan to be suspended. Recently, the Taiwan Industrial and Commercial Bank of Changhua, started accepting remittances at 80% of the official rate. One Taiwan dollar is converted into 57.6 jiao of legal tender, but it is said that there are still not many remitters.</p>
<h3>Banks' Uniform Clearing; Money Market Slightly Loosened</h3>
<p>[Our Report] National banks cleared 77.1 billion yuan at the bill exchange yesterday, and the money market has loosened, but the unofficial interest rate is still at 2 jiao.

<h3>Rayon Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Rayon was weak in the market yesterday morning, but suddenly rose in the afternoon, resulting in a slight increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. No. 120 Kosan rayon with luster was transacted at 44.5 million yuan in the morning, with the lowest price at 4 million yuan, but it reached 5 million yuan by noon. In the afternoon, due to the increase in yarn prices, out-of-town manufacturers showed some interest in buying, causing prices to rise, and the final selling price was 6.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Silk</p>
<p>Due to oversupply, the listed prices of all grades in yesterday's market were cut by about 500,000 yuan. Grade 5 silk still lacked trading, with a bid price of 45 million yuan for C-grade, but a counter-offer of 4.5 million yuan was not successful. Retail prices ranged from 3 million to 4 million yuan. Retail prices of dried factory silk were transacted at 31 million yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>In yesterday's market, Dachen and Huaqiang's real silk quilt covers opened at 6.9 million yuan, but prices fell gradually due to supply and demand imbalances. Near the close of the market, the spot price was 7.8 million yuan, and the forward price was 6.956 million yuan. The forward price of Mayar quilt covers was 7 million yuan, while plaid crepe remained at 58,000 to 59,000 yuan.

<p>Kerosene Oil Remains Firmly Popular</p>
<p>The kerosene market has seen strong sales due to the long absence of deliveries from Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco, and the weather turning cooler. The market inventory is exhausted, and prices are exceptionally strong. The price of high-grade barrel oil rose from 1.8 million to 2 million yuan yesterday. It is reported that the black market price has risen to 2.4 million yuan. Mobil and Asiatic canned oil have also risen sharply to 257,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Adjustment Price Increased Again; Coarse and Fine Yarn Rose Consistently; 20-Count Yarn Increased by 700,000 Yuan Compared to Previous Price</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee raised the negotiated price of cotton yarn again yesterday, with 20-count yarn listed at 15.2 million yuan, an increase of 700,000 yuan compared to the previous price. The prices of other counts of yarn were determined by referring to market conditions and proportional calculations.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened steadily, but later, due to the loosening of the money market and increased demand from local and Tianjin merchants, and especially because the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee raised the price of 20-count coarse yarn by 700,000 yuan and 42-count fine yarn by 1.3 million yuan, the market sentiment was strengthened, and the desire to buy was strong, with prices rising across the board. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rebounded by 950,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and 20-count Special Double Horse and Light Double Horse yarn both rose by 530,000 yuan. Other 16-count, 10-count, and various counts of fine yarn rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to 800,000 to 900,000 yuan per piece.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Sells Yarn</p>
<p>[Our Report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn yesterday as usual in two groups, A and B. Group A sold 1,098 pieces, with 495 applications. Group B sold 121 pieces, with 121 applications. The two groups sold a total of 2,219 pieces, equivalent to 2,103.5 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 616 applications.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Skyrockets</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market suddenly skyrocketed again, with all types of cloth reaching new highs. It is reported that Tianjin merchants are heavily buying Sunshine Fine Cloth, because the price in that area is 100,000 yuan higher per bolt than in Shanghai, and there is also an exchange rate difference that can be exploited. It is also rumored that transportation to the north may be opened up, and the negotiated price of cotton yarn has also increased. The industry has not opened goods from China Textile Construction for two periods, the market has insufficient supply, and the buying interest is very strong, with the market sentiment boosted, and the prices are strong. By noon, 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth rose all the way to 700,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 58,000 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Five Fortunes, Blue Chicken, Colored Balls, and other fine cloths also rose by 57,000 to 67,000 yuan. Drills, Diagonal Cloths, Yuan Cloths, and Shirting Cloths were in high demand, and the price increase was even sharper. Other bleached cloths, twills, poplins, etc. were also very strong.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton prices rose again due to the increase in cotton yarn and increased buying interest. In the afternoon, due to the loosening of the money market, yarn factories frequently purchased cotton, and prices rose again. Lingshi's highest price was 3.55 million, an increase of 100,000 compared to the previous day, and other grades followed suit, rising by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

Zhoupu seed cotton was 525,000.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market opened with average prices due to deliveries from Yonghe, but later, due to new buyers purchasing, and the rumor that the cigarette tax would be adjusted to 100%, buyers' appetite was stronger, and prices rose again. Finally, 10-piece British cigarettes rose to 17.9 million yuan, a rebound of 600,000 compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also rose by 750,000. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 to 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but canned cigarettes fell.</p>
<h3>China Trust Stops Purchasing 1947 Tea</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to China Trust Bureau news: Regarding the 1947 tea, tea merchants previously requested the government to purchase it. However, due to changes in foreign exchange measures and improved export difficulties, and the Agricultural Bank has relaxed the amount of tea pledge loans, the government has decided to stop purchasing the 1947 tea. The Central Trust Bureau has received an order from the Four Banks Joint Office to stop purchasing.</p>
<p>As for the 1946 tea purchased by the China Trust Bureau, both Chinese and foreign tea merchants are now competing to purchase it. The China Trust Bureau has submitted this case to President Zhang for instructions, but no decision has been made yet.</p>

<h3>Rediscovering the True Meaning of Love for Those Who Have Lost Love</h3>
<p>Xu Yijun: Your letter has been received. We, of course, express our deepest sympathy for your situation. Judging from your letter, your love seems to be the type of "love at first sight." Young men and women often easily fall in love due to temporary emotional impulses, without mutual understanding or knowledge. The foundation of this kind of "love" is often very unstable. In the second month after you entered university, you started a "friendship" with her, and soon you both swore "to grow old together." This kind of "lightning-fast" love often does not have good results.</p>
<p>She wrote to you saying that her parents opposed this marriage, and therefore she became indifferent to you. If she truly loved you, things would never be so simple.</p>
<p>Love is a part of the process of life, not the whole of life. Success in love is certainly gratifying, but losing love is not necessarily tragic. The vast world will never be without a place for you. You should expand your "love" to the vast number of people, and entrust your spirit to your future career. We believe you will definitely be able to let it go. Wishing you progress (Editor) (Letters to the editor are published in this column on Sundays)</p>

<h3>Recent Portuguese Theatre</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The background of Portuguese theatre is existentialism. The so-called existentialism (Existentialism) is nothing more than the meaning of "living to survive," enthusiastic, clamorous, and forward-rushing. Merchants are cautious and have few illusions, and they cannot understand abstract theories. They call art coquettish, a demand for beauty. So-called survival is "bullfighting, women, and wine." Most recently, the national drama is about wandering singers. They sing heartbreaking ballads, and the Portuguese sit around and listen all night.</p>
<p>Like every capital on the European continent, Lisbon boasts a national theatre. Its Corinthian architectural facade is a lifeless imitation of Paris and London. Occasionally, it performs a Greek classical play "Antigone" or a Portuguese classical ethical play, otherwise it performs the outdated "Lady Windermere's Fan."</p>
<p>Compared to popular entertainment, so-called international drama can only be considered barren. However, there is one comedian, Francisco Ribeiro, who is worth mentioning. He believes that Portugal's real drama can be powerful and universal. He sincerely believes in the theatrical tastes of his countrymen. Several years ago, he organized a troupe called the People's Theatre, with two one-act plays by Pirandello and Maeterlinck's "Interior." These dramas were very successful, more effective than any domestic comedy. The farmers opened their mouths in surprise and watched until the end.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Ribeiro ran the Trinidad Theatre in Lisbon, revealing the sign of "the voice of freedom." Immediately, half a dozen of the best actors from the National Theatre ran to his camp. At that time, people in the city had rarely heard of Ibsen and Pirandello, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" had just been discovered, and he continued to perform Shaw, Hauptmann, Giraudoux, and Sartre with redoubled efforts. The plays currently being prepared include dramas from England, Russia, the United States, and Spain.</p>
<p>For small countries wanting to perform international dramas, the biggest problem is translation. The situation in Lisbon is complicated, and most intellectuals are not free. Ribeiro had to do the translation himself.</p>
<p>Ribeiro calls his theatre "the comedians of Lisbon." He calls all the theatre troupes in Latin-speaking countries "comedians," and actors from different troupes can exchange with each other. For example, the comedians of Madrid, the theatre actors of Rome, etc. In this way, it can soon become a vast international theatrical union.</p>
<p>There is also a small theatre, crowded with audiences, making people feel suffocated, and the order is chaotic. This is Lisbon's standard performance of Portuguese plays. People from the wrestling arena sit in the front row, throwing kisses to friends on stage. It is almost equal to a performance for art lovers.</p>
<p>The Portuguese popular theatre, which is also standard, recently had a successful opera called "The Washerwoman." The stables, hay, harnesses, and two skinny donkeys are all real. The skills of Portuguese farmers will be close to the art of Moscow.</p>
<h3>Literary Quotes - Eastern Haze</h3>
<p>Generally, in my opinion, the task placed before writers of our time is this: we must learn to write works that can be understood by the majority of mankind. We must guide the public to develop an interest in literature.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must write clear, concise, and as simple as possible works. — Zuo Qinke</p>
<h3>Under the Five Pavilion Bridge - Twenty-One Continuing the Yangzhou Dream</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>The things that Yangzhou people who love to visit Slender West Lake love about it will vary depending on their temperament, learning, and age. Take the author as an example: when I was studying in elementary school, after school in the afternoon, I would often gather three or five classmates and run and jump all the way to the opposite bank of Little Golden Hill. Spending one or two copper coins, we could all cross the river and climb straight up to the Fengting Pavilion on the back hill. Looking around at the vastness, we would sing a song loudly or shout a few times wildly, and then hurry back. At that time, the Fengting Pavilion on Little Golden Hill should have been the thing that I loved the most. Later, I occasionally dabbled in writing, seeming to have a fondness for literature and art, but in reality, I only tried things superficially. However, I did acquire quite a few literati habits because of this. Therefore, when visiting Slender West Lake, I would prefer to steer a small boat alone, forlornly heading towards the misty waters. To put it more elegantly, it was to search for poetic inspiration, but in reality, it was just to satisfy my secluded thoughts and give free rein to my imagination. Also, because I don't like crowds, I am too lazy to mingle with the many tour boats, and I especially dislike seeing the vulgar monks in the mountain temples who say "Please come in and sit" and "Have some good tea." Therefore, I would never hold a banquet at Little Golden Hill, Xu Garden, or Fahaizi Temple to show my boldness. But regardless of how it is, the area under the Five Pavilion Bridge in Slender West Lake is always a place that everyone loves very much. It seems that it does not vary depending on temperament, learning, or age.</p>
<p>The "Yangzhou Painting Boat Records" says: "Four Bridges Misty Rain, also known as Huang Garden, is Huang's villa." It also says: "Four Bridges Misty Rain is the name of the garden. The four bridges are: Rainbow Bridge, Changchun Bridge, Chunbo Bridge, and Lotus Bridge. The Rainbow, Changchun, and Chunbo Bridges are all of the usual design. The Flower Bridge has five pavilions built on it, supported by four wings. Each wing has three gates, which together with the main gate make fifteen gates. The gazetteer says that there is a Wang Ban among the four bridges, but there is no Rainbow Bridge. Today's Jade Tablet Bridge is a small bridge next to Changchun Ridge, and is not within the four bridges." I was born late, and have not seen the Jade Tablet Bridge and Chunbo Bridge mentioned in the Painting Boat Records. I have only seen the Rainbow Bridge, Changchun Bridge, and Lotus Bridge. This Lotus Bridge is what is commonly called the Five Pavilion Bridge, because it "has five pavilions built on top." However, before 1933, it had been in disrepair for many years, and the five pavilions on the bridge had collapsed one after another, to the point that there were no pavilions at all. For a time, tourists jokingly called it the No Pavilion Bridge. In 1933, local people such as Wang Boling advocated repairing the bridge, and organized the Rebuilding Yangzhou Five Pavilion Bridge Committee. They raised several thousand yuan, and also moved bricks, tiles, and timber from the imperial palace in the city, and only then were the five pavilions on the bridge rebuilt. To this day, there is still a stone inscription written by Wang commemorating the rebuilding of the Five Pavilion Bridge, placed on the bridge.</p>
<p>Because there are five pavilions on this bridge, it is quite interesting to occasionally stand at the head of the bridge and look at the surrounding scenery, the tour boats under the bridge, unafraid of the scorching sun and unconcerned about sudden rain. But in the end, it is not as good as the hidden paradise inside the bridge opening. The "supported by four wings, each wing has three gates" mentioned in the Painting Boat Records means that in each of the three gates in each wing, which is the bridge opening, two small tour boats, or one large tour boat, can fit. In reality, not many large tour boats enter, because at most they can only enter halfway, and the stern of the boat must be left outside. Therefore, this hidden paradise is mostly exclusively occupied by small tour boats.</p>
<p>After the tourists have steered their small tour boats inside, they can lie on rattan chairs and take a nap. Good wind blows in from the three gates. No matter how scorching the sun is outside, it is always a cool world inside. The main gate of the bridge is the necessary path for visiting Ping Shan Tang. Intentionally or unintentionally greeting the passing boats inside is also a good place to enjoy the scenery and express one's feelings. Furthermore, the rising and falling of the songs played on water and the swaying of the willows along the river are particularly pleasing to the ear and delightful to the eye.</p>
<p>However, although these bridge openings can accommodate two small tour boats, if one has already entered, taking the early advantage, then the latecomers will mostly stop outside, or just look from afar and leave. Therefore, the so-called "four wings" under the Five Pavilion Bridge do not become too noisy. Anyway, those who steer their boats into the bridge openings do so to avoid the noise, to enjoy the coolness, and perhaps to talk about love. Those who are determined to tour the lake or want to join in the fun do not want to steer inside. Even if they do go in and stop, they will leave after a very short period of time.</p>
<p>I have lived an unsettled life. The older I get, the less time I spend in Yangzhou. Whenever I recall the scenery of my hometown, I always think of the area under the Five Pavilion Bridge first. But how can I have more free time to allow my small boat to avoid the dust and enjoy the coolness under it again!</p>

<h3>Precipice and Valley</h3>
<p>— Qian Jinxi</p>
<p>Have you ever picnicked with your friends under the emerald green shade of trees on a misty mountain? Have you ever stood between mountain peaks, opening your mouth wide to listen to your echo? Perhaps you, like a geologist, explored the rocks, or perhaps you were a hunter searching for the burrows of porcupines and rabbits. If you were a mischievous child, you would climb to the treetops and gaze into the distance.</p>
<p>I also love to wander among the misty ridges. I love those old pines, which remind me of ancient old men playing chess on stones beneath the pines, savoring life. I love those flowing springs, which remind me of a platinum necklace on the chest of a girl in a green cheongsam. I love the treacherous passes, the places where brave soldiers defend the territory with machine guns. Listening to the myriad songs of the orioles, I feel as if I am in an opera house; watching the thousand kinds of flowers dancing, I suspect that I am in the Jade Bamboo Garden overseas.</p>
<p>And today, along that winding path, constantly pulling my clothes from the thorns, I came to a peculiar cliff.</p>
<p>This is precisely the precipice, looking down upon a thousand-foot sheer wall, a deep valley of loss, full of thorny jujubes and hazelnuts, like an ancient well.</p>
<p>Let's call it a thousand-foot sheer wall; yet on the mountain wall, there are still some rocky corners that can be grasped, but the eroded stones seem as if they will fall with just a gust of wind and rain. Who would dare climb down the mountain to explore the secluded and strange valley?</p>
<p>But no, children who love stories, timid children, brave people fear nothing.</p>
<p>Let me weave a story for you! I don't know what era it was, but in these mountains, a beautiful princess and a valiant knight were hunting side by side.</p>
<p>The knight was brave because he had love in his heart. Love encouraged him, love guided him, love made him unafraid of all difficulties.</p>
<p>They hunted many wild rabbits, pheasants, and turtledoves. A peacock dancing with seven-colored feathers attracted them. They chased after it, chased after it, all the way to the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>At the edge of the cliff, the princess shot it with a feathered arrow, and the magnificent bird fell straight into the valley, hanging on the branch of a small tree, the mountain wind fluttering its colorful feathers.</p>
<p>"What a beautiful peacock," the princess sighed, "We chased it for so long! But we can't get it, can we?"</p>
<p>"No, we can get it." The knight's reply was very brave.</p>
<p>"Unless it flies up again." A humorous, almost sad smile.</p>
<p>The dead peacock would certainly not fly up again, but the living knight would fly down! Disregarding the princess's dissuasion, he jumped off his horse and climbed down into the valley. He was as agile as a startled eagle, as swift as a swallow, his golden armor flashing with sparkling light. He finally obtained the peacock.</p>
<p>Coming up, presenting the peacock to the princess, the princess smiled, a gentle smile. She discovered that the most beautiful thing in the world was not the peacock's colorful feathers, but the knight's heroic posture.</p>
<p>Oh! You might be eager to speak, ... Is it that the princess wanted to admire that precious heroic figure again, and threw the peacock back into the valley.</p>
<p>And... the knight thus became a perpetual guest of the valley!</p>
<p>Oh! Child, don't think that way! Isn't that too tragic? Don't be so melancholic! I tell you, that princess had a kind heart. She happily accompanied the knight back, vowing never to come to this cliff again to look down, nor to allow the knight to explore the secluded traces of the valley again.</p>
<p>Thus, this cliff became even more desolate—look, haven't I turned around because I felt too lonely?</p>
<h3>Bodhisattva Man - In the Style of Niu Jiao</h3>
<p>— Gu Yiqiao</p>
<p>Ode to South Lake, Jiaxing</p>
<p>Mandarin ducks wash mandarin duck brocade, mandarin ducks pillow in mandarin duck lake. Pagoda shadow, evening bell sound, red makeup, enchanting melody startles. Autumn forest, cloud-covered Han, water chestnut lotus flowers fall. Intoxicated with the moon, spending this life, boat lost in the misty rain.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, A River of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Miss Ji...!" A sharp yet turbid voice shouted loudly behind Yaoqun at this moment.</p>
<p>Yaoqun was startled and quickly stopped and turned around. At the same time, this strange voice struck her eardrums, triggering her memory – that half-man, half-woman transvestite!</p>
<p>"Miss Ji, you don't need to look for them. I know their 'nest'! Turning around…"</p>
<p>"Hmm? Oh... Oh!..." Yaoqun was even more surprised: How could this fellow suddenly greet her like this? …And how could he guess what was on her mind?</p>
<p>"Sorry... 'You, this one'!" Yaoqun paused at this point. She seemed unwilling to call him "Miss" or "Madam," judging by the monster's voice, like an amateur opera singer playing a female role, squeezing his vocal cords and pinching his nose to produce that sharp voice. Beneath the sharp sound, a trailing note.</p>
<p>"Have we met somewhere?" Although Yaoqun hesitated, she still completed this challenging sentence, and straightened her eyebrows, and opened wide her eyes, clear and shining. In other words, she wanted to say, "Who do you think you are?" or "Do you know who your ancestors are?" This Northeast daughter was showing her temper.</p>
<p>"Where we've met, I'll tell you later..." My name is Mai Shafu, surname Mai, given name Shafu..." Saying this, he cracked open two thick, wide lips in a smile, revealing several large, crooked front teeth and half-exposed purple-black gums. Because his lips and gums were purple-black, it was necessary to describe them truthfully, otherwise one could borrow the phrase "blood basin mouth" to describe them, wouldn't that save ink?</p>
<p>After introducing himself, this fellow flashed to the outside of the gate, brushed past Yaoqun, stepped down a step, and without waiting for Yaoqun to speak, he put away that smile, worth a thousand gold pieces and scaring people to death, and with a taut face, said immediately: "I still have to hurry up and say a few words to them! At most three to five minutes, I'll come back and ask you about something... Please wait a moment, we're all on the same line, don't be afraid!..." While speaking, he stepped back down the steps; after speaking, he turned to leave, but after taking two or three steps, he seemed to remember something again, twisted his tiger neck, raised his hand and waved to Yaoqun, his fingers, like carrot sticks, were imitating the style of a beauty's orchid fingers; just as he was waving, two delicate words slipped out from his teeth: "Bye-bye!" After "Bye-bye," he smiled again.</p>
<p>An ancient song says: "A smile back turns a hundred graces born, the six palaces of powdered faces pale!" But this fellow's smile simply shook the mountains and moved the seas, changing the color of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that Yaoqun should have taken this opportunity to use her skills to sneak and hide, follow him, and hang on his tail to see what he was up to, because in the current situation, the other party's actions were hidden, while she was in plain sight; every move was in their eyes. This is the biggest taboo in secret operations. But Yaoqun didn't do that. She knew that when you meet a strong enemy, the most important thing is to reverse "light" and "dark"; at least, to investigate the other party's background and actions clearly in order to respond. But in these short three to five minutes, how easy is it to investigate this fellow's actions!</p>
