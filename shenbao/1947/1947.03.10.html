<h3>台北基隆騷亂未已各機關被暴徒襲擊　中央將派白部長往宣慰</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北九日電〕五日來之表面平靜局面，已被昨夜之不斷槍聲所學破。台人中之靑年暴徒，昨日下午二時攻擊基隆要塞司令部，當被擊斃二人。基隆旋即戒嚴，台北市亦有暴徒分組發動攻勢。昨夜十時半，圓山海軍辦事處首被襲繫，其他暴徒則分別攻擊供應局，倉庫，警備總司令部，陸軍醫院及公署。頓時步槍機關槍及手榴彈聲大作，約歷一小時。閩台監察使楊亮功昨午即乘海平輪，自閩抵達基隆港。下午十時始能登岸。同輪抵台者，有憲兵兩營，楊氏及隨員劉啓堃亦乘戟運憲兵之卡車，於今晨二時自基隆出發，行至中途遭遇暴徒之阻截，互相開槍，憲兵一人受傷，劉啓堃亦被繫斷手指，楊氏幸先移動坐位，朱遭意外，然亦飽受虛驚，且曾跌於車旁。彼等三時始抵台北。今據楊氏稱：「暴徒携有步槍，手溜彈及小砲」台北澈夜槍聲未絕，死傷未明。今長六時全市戒嚴，軍憲出動佈崗，禁止暴徒集團通行，槍聲仍多。據悉，陳長官仍決定實行所作之一切諾言，然對於暴徒之不法行爲，決子制止「二二八」事件處理委會，昨提之卅二條要求，顯欲反抗中央，陳氏　後，極表震怒。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北八日電〕此間民間負責維持治安之「忠義曹務隊」隊員及靑年學生，三日來日夜搜查此間外省人之住宅。彼輩聲稱，搜查民間槍枝，然文件亦在檢查之列，並公開掠取金錢·手表·衣服·物品而去，且恒整街搜查，甚至有一住宅，竟被掠劫四次以上者。彼輩除掠劫外，同時製造恐怖行爲。葛敬恩公館內，被一台人投擲手溜彈一枚，葛夫人聞及硫磺氣息時，有一外省籍傭人已受微傷。葛氏夫婦今夜均已搬入公翳住宿。陳長官自「二二一八」以來，迄仍住宿公署坐鎭。各處處長亦均宿於署內。陳長官之弟陳公銓宅，今亦被搜查。本社昨夜則被竊去自行車三架及衣服八套。今下午電話機四座均尙斷綫，無法通話。此種日夜騷亂之非法行爲，已使此間外省人宿食難安。現彼等均急於求去。兩日來前往招商局登記船位之外省人，已達數千人。此間編譯館某省籍職員，今突感神經錯亂疾。彼等所受之刺激，可以想見。公署民政處長周一鸚，今下午曾赴「二二八」事件處理委員會交涉，要求該會制止再有搜查住宅之事。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕聞中央將派白部畏崇禧赴合宣慰。</p>
<h3>晉西共軍渡黃河　紛紛調往延安東南集中</h3>
<p>〔本報西安九日電〕晋西共軍不斷調回延安集中，二三五旅西調之後，三五八旅亦已偷渡黃河，紛紛加入延安之正南及東南一帶，防守該地區原有之敎導第一。第二兩旅，已合編爲敎導旅，均屬中共之中堅部隊，其旅部及第三國，刻仍防守延安東南十五公里之金盆灣。延安一切軍事性機構，又多集中此地區，亦一重要據點。其第二團駐汾河中流之臨眼，該地亦集結有重兵，第一團駐鄺縣，爲關中沿公路入延安地區境界內第一座門。又宜君·馬攔一帶袋形陣地，此次迅被解決，當日該地區共軍指揮官胡景鐸已被撤職他調，遺缺由楊虎城之子楊極民繼任，指揮所設水家坪，該山岳地帶時尙有小股出沒</p>
<h3>毛澤東行蹤詭秘</h3>
<p>〔聯合社延安九日電〕消息靈通人士今日吿聯合社稱：中共領袖毛澤東行止不定，罕爲人見，其卜居地點，殆每週遷移，藉免可能的空襲，並保持環境幽靜，以便從事繁重工作。毛氏確實住址，僅中共少數要負及其寸步不離之衛士知之。</p>
<h3>孫連仲赴保</h3>
<p>綏署人事無大變動</p>
<p>〔本報北平九日電〕孫連仲定十日晨赴保，九日下午召官兵訓話，渠就冀省現局吿記者，平漢北段經近日之肅淸，共軍主力除被擊潰者外，多竄山地。徐水·滿城附近，雖仍有相當數目之共軍活動，但不足威脅交通綫之安全。國軍目下未作用要行動，但可控制共軍之竄擾。永定河北岸已無大股共軍，津浦北段近日現緊張，自魯境竄來滄縣地區者，似多爲潰軍，國軍已嚴防。北寗綫兩則無大事故。冀東灤縣。昌黎。豐潤等縣情况最好，爲使之成爲推行新政之示範縣，正積極訓練鄕以下幹部，共的九千名。現冀東存在之共軍，仍爲李運昌部約萬人，盤據於薊縣，遵化山中，間有　擾。</p>
<p>〔本報保定九日電〕孫連仲定十日來保，主持冀省首屆臨參會開幕及保定綏署成立事宜，長官部改組綏署後，決於本月內由平遷保竣事。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平九日電〕第十一戰區長官部，自本月一日起改組爲保定綏靖公署，內部人事業經發表，無大變動。</p>
<h3>吉林東部吿警</h3>
<p>〔中央社吉林八日電〕吉林西北兩而之紫張形勢稍緩，東面刻又吿警。昨晚六時，老爺嶺以東突發現自蛟河方面竄來裝備整齊之共軍的四千人，九日晨天崗東南約廿五華里處東北岔一帶，發現共軍的萬人。又吉林以南樺甸，磐石附近，亦集結數目不明之共軍甚衆，國軍正嚴密戒備中。</p>
<h3>中共與韓共有密切關係</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日電〕前鋒論壇報本日以首頁刊載該報記者史蒂爾七日漢城電訊一則。標題爲「中共與朝鮮北部蘇佔領區發生密切關係」文中稱，根據若干跡瞪，中共與朝鮮北部共黨當局已有密切合作協議。又稱，據獲自蘇佔領區之確實消息，朝鮮與中共有關係，大批朝鮮軍隊數月以來，自東北進入韓境，今已成爲蘇聯支持下，北韓政府軍隊之有力部隊。軍隊人數的爲五萬名，部隊中雜多士兵，於日本投降後，居留東北。彼等之領袖爲延安方面訓陳者，若干並爲中共軍官學校與政治學校畢業生。其最高領袖爲金穆中（譯音）。渠爲一老牌中共黨員，亦朝鮮籍，曾居留延安。其後充任朝鮮義勇軍司令。今則爲朝鮮北部新成立之美名爲「保安軍」司令。此批兵士與北韓警察，將成爲軍隊核心，蓋朝鮮蘇軍佔領區中，已有大批人民由於不明原因究竟，而受徵集者。「在延受訓之朝人，雖主要俱係參與北韓政權之軍事方面者，然亦有若干佔政治要職」。在中國受訓之朝鮮共產黨人，與操縱北韓政府之在蘇受訓，更爲極端之朝鮮共產黨人間之關係，並非永遠和好者，然彼等在政策及戰略方面之主要不同點大部份俱已氷釋。有一部份認爲共產主義，對朝鮮過爲激烈之人士，已移往美軍佔領下之南韓。彼等將在該處擁護較溫和陣綫。中國東北「共黨民主聯軍」內之韓人，於去年初秋起，即憶開始遷入北韓，迄今猶在繼續中。此項運動，傳係遵照延安對東北共黨之訓令而行者。傳此項訓令強調中韓黨派間密切合作之重要性，若蘇聯退出北韓，則此種聯絡或將更趨重要。中共仍控制中韓邊疆之大部份地區，故彼等在必要時，甚易以食物及軍事供應供給朝鮮共黨，故美蘇軍隊若一旦撤退，則中共此項援助，可在赤化整個朝鮮中成爲一决定性因素。中共與蘇聯不同，彼等幷不受任何可圓國際條約之禁止或阻遏。更有進者，中共所控制之東北洛後鄕村中，有甚多朝鮮移民。此乃一豐富之人力儲藏所也，東北朝鮮毘鄰之山地，又可作爲訓練未來朝鮮遊擊隊之良好基地。</p>
<h3>胡適談時局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨在國際飯店遇胡適之先生，他是在六日由北平直飛本市的。</p>
<p>記者請胡先生對於國事作一個歷史的看法。他最初不肯，認為「歷史從來不重演」，因此難於作比較。後來他表示：中國以毫無準備的國家，遭遇歷史上八年的空前大戰，目前的困難是當然的現像，有許多病是歷史上繼承下來的，我們不能逃避現實。世界大戰雖吿結束，各國都還沒有恢復常態，英法不必說，即使富如美國，受戰爭的直接損害最少，但是在旅行和住屋上，依然沒有恢復戰前的情形。</p>
<p>胡氏認為要國共合作，不大可能。他說：過去致書毛澤東，要中共做中國的工黨，是君子愛人以德，現在承認是太樂觀了，是一胡適之的歷史的錯誤」。英美式的政黨與蘇聯式的政黨，本質上是大不相同的。英國工黨現在是執政黨，如果在三年後大選失敗的話，自會退出政府，不致動員武力來維護政權，這點共黨辦得到嗎？</p>
<p>談到改組政府，胡氏連稱沒有意見。他說：報上說他要參加政府，實是毫無根據。「中國眞正的自由主義者，爲數已是很少，留此數人在政府之外，爲國家做事，為人民做事，也是很需要的。我的朋友瞭解這瞇，政府也明瞭這點，外時所傳，毫無根據」。</p>
<p>關於莫斯科外長會議，胡氏說：因爲事情太忙，沒有時間看外國報，對於國際政治尙未加以研究。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據新近來自台灣之某氏談：台北「二二八」事件，當地小阪與軍警發生衝突，引起各地之騷動，僅爲台灣一般人民誤會台灣長官制度即日本時代總督制之導火綫。一般人因不滿長官制及專賣制，平睦積怨情緒日高，加以去年台灣糧荒問題，當局未能即時獲得有效措施，人民因生活不安，所引起之惡劣情緒達於極點，偶有小衝突事件發生，即易免引起誤會。</p>
<p>處理委員會以政府自居</p>

<h3>政府擬具配合緊急措施政策　引導游資用於生產　處置國外存款採獎勵辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕據某經濟學權威，全國最高經濟決策人，九日晨告本報記者：經濟緊急措施方案實施後，政府正擬具各種與之配合之政策。渠信上述辦法一一實行後，全國經濟可望於八九月內恢復政常狀態，通貨亦可不復膨脹，且可進而入於繁榮境地。據稱，緊急方案之目的，僅為以政治力量協助解決經濟問題，而即將實施之根本方針，則期以經濟本身之力量，誘導一切資金，用於生產正當途徑，以經濟方式，解決經濟問題。目前欲平衡國家預算，僅從　　支出入手，當非易事。當局近曾召集各機關負責人與主計處共商減省不必要支出辦法，僉認此事困難重重，然就增加收入而言，則渠信有七八成可達到，此事一方面固有待於增加稅收，然國營事業改為民營，亦可增加國庫收入。關於此事主辦人翁副院長曾提出一具體數字，將來或能更有增加，上述種種及其他必要措施，主要為增加生產，此次三中全會中對此將鄭重討論，其辦法扼要言之，為出國家銀行及私人銀行貸款於工農團體貸款者，主要條件為「借款後必需歸還生產品，契約締結後，即由銀行以貸款中之七成，代表政府為商家定購原料，由厰商予以製造，再以產品歸還政府，利息全收」，如是大部原料及利用原料所製成之日用必需品，皆可為政府所掌握，當不致再發生游資作崇及日用品被囤積，而致危及民生之現象。</p>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕國外存款處理辦法，業經經濟政策委會審查通過，聞該辦法要點在用獎勵辦法，合在外所存款項能回國從事生產事業，因之，持有人若能以其　置機器，則不論在運輸上，借款上，皆將予以特殊便利。至若干立法委員所提由政府征用一部份之辦法，則因目前為平時，不能與戰時相比，似難採用。又聞：關於處置在外存款辦法，政府正經由外交途徑與外國洽商中。</p>

<h3>莫斯科會議的一大考騐</h3>
<p>英美法三國代表團已於昨日聯袂行抵莫斯科，舉世矚望的四國外長會議今天在莫斯科空軍俱樂部開幕了。這是一九四七年的第一次外長會議，也就是戰後最重要的一次國際會議；世界的安危與人類的禍福，均將視這次國際會議的結果如何而定了。這次外長會議的最大的任務，乃在先由四國外長擬就對德和約的草案，然後再決定對德和會，俾將對德和約作最後的決定，從而使戰後的歐洲早日恢復常態。對德和約的簽訂，不僅可使與德國有關的各項問題，均可迎刃而解；而且對德和約是對日和約的榜樣，對於今後整個世界政局，都有非常重大的關係。所以莫斯科外長會議的開幕，不僅出席會議的四強存着極大的期望，就是世界其他各國，對於這次國際會議的開幕，也莫不表示關懷與注意。</p>
<p>緣自第二次大戰結束以來，以歐洲而論，將近兩年了：就是在遠東言，也快要一年有半了。人類受了這次大戰的殘酷教訓，并攝於原子能以及其他具有大規模破壞性的戰器之威脅，莫不渴望戰後的世界能早日踏進和平民主的新時代，大家都能自由生活和平相處，不再遭受戰禍的威脅；無如戰後的國際政局，波瀾迭起，大有一波未平一波又起之勢，直到去年巴黎和會，即將對義·羅·匈·保·芬五國和約，起草成功；其後四國外長又在紐約開會，四強意見漸趨接近，始使戰後動亂的世局，獲得一平靜的歸趨。論者咸謂，收拾戰後殘局，首在締結對德對日和約，而今對此二大戰的罪魁禍首，置之不顧，反而先與這些附庸國家義·羅·匈·保·芬五國簽訂和約，不免有「捨本愛末」之感。但在另一方面看來「避重就輕」在外交上，要不失為手段之一，各國對於戰後最關重要的德日問題，意見既不能一致，當不如姑置不論，俟其時機成熟之後，再行討論。所以對德對日和約的遲遲未能締結成功，與其說戰後國際未能協調，不如說各國外交家的一種延宕手段。與其草率從事，勉強締結對德對日和約，還不如慎重將事，靜待其瓜熟蒂落。所以我們對於德國的問題延宕到今天始能加以討論，并沒有失之太遲的感覺；我們但願四強能顧全世界大局，竭誠交換意見，將歐洲運命有關的德國問題，謀得澈底的解決，勿再遲延不決。</p>
<p>莫斯科外長會議的主要議題，既在與德國有關之各項問題，故這次會議的任務，首在解決這些問題，但是所謂德國問題，範圍既極廣泛，內容又極複雜，僅要完成這個任務，也不是一件輕而易舉的事情；我們即已常識來判斷，也深知莫斯科會議前途的困難。同時我們再將英美法三國外長在赴會會途中所發表的談話，作一分析，更可以明瞭，我們對於莫斯科外長會議的成功，是不能樂觀過早的。例如美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥離華府時談稱：『四國外長會議之工作，殆極困難；對德和約未必能在會議期間，草擬完成；此次會議之目的，僅在就對德和約之基本要點，獲致協定而已；此項目的若能達到，則余將不勝愉快矣』英國外相貝文行抵華沙時，亦發表談話稱：『余希望四國外長會議解決德國問題，能獲得成功；余若不懷有此種希望，則余不致長途跋涉前往莫斯科矣。』此在法國外長比杜爾的態度，則更加悲觀了。他在華沙向波蘭記者談稱：『德國問題範圍廣大，若欲德國問題整個解決，固極困難；但各個有關德國之問題，分別解決，亦屬同樣困難。』</p>
<p>由此說業，莫斯科外長會議討論德國問題，欲獲得澈底解決，并不是一件輕而易舉的工作；但是德國問題，是戰後國際問題的核心，其能否解決，對於歐洲甚至整個世界，關係實在太大了，當不能再有所遲延，故四國的政治外交家，在這次莫斯科會議中，應該竭知盡能，運用全力，謀得德國問題的解決；同時全世界愛好和平的人民，亦應在精神上為外長會議的後盾，務使這次莫斯科會議能獲得成功，在戰後和平運動的歷史上，展開一張新頁。誠如美國外交政策專家杜勒斯所說：『戰時人民犧牲何止百萬，但其理想繼續存在，吾人既倖免於死者，當負有一种神聖的責任，應尊重死者之遺志，締造世界和平。吾人前往莫斯科，將竭力設法達成此一目的；但為獲得成功起見，尚需要美國人民在精神上為吾人之後盾。』只要全世界的人民一致為外長會議的後盾，只許成功不許失敗，我們相信，不論德國問題的範圍如何廣泛，不論德國問題的內容如何複雜，更不論四強對於德國問題的意見如何紛歧，但是這次莫斯科會議，性能圓滿閉幕的。</p>
<p>最後，我們不能不重言聲明我國對於莫斯科外長會議的態度。今日之我國，在現行國際關係之殆為最好和平的國家，對於世界和平及國際合作，與四強負有同等的義務，無往而不企求締造和平的成功，無時而不渴望真正和平的實現，尤其對於這次起草對德和芍的外長會議，抱着無限的希望，不僅渴望四強對於德國問題能謀得澈底的解決，而且竭誠盼望四強對於其他國際問題也能商得妥協，成為今後四強通力合作的起點。但是關於我國本身的問題，我們相信必能自謀解決之道，毋需四強為我國操心，四強若將中國問題列入議程，不啻有傷我國的尊嚴，有損我國在國際上應處的地位，而且足以造成國際干涉之漸，絕非我國人民所能容忍。我國外交當局業已照會四強，不得將中國問題列入議程之內，四國外交當局沒有表示異議，我們的懮懼原已不復存在；但是在會內會外，似不免要涉及中國問題，所以我們不得不向四強大聲疾呼，要求國際正義的不容忽視。昔時的雅爾達會議決不能容許其重演於今日。記得去年二月間雅爾達秘密決議公佈之後，全世界的與論譁然，不僅我全國人民一致表示憤慨，就是美國公正人士也莫不一致斥為賣友的行為。所以這次莫斯科會議，如果不得我國參加，實在無權討論中國問題；不得我國的同意，更不應作任何性質的協議。這是我國全國人民一致的公意，也就是國際正義的呼聲，今後國際政治能否以正義為基礎，俾締結公正，合理，永久的和平，莫斯科外長會議是否尊重我國的民意，就是當前的一大考騐。</p>

<h3>奠定歐洲永久和平基礎　外長會議今開幕　蘇聯方面對前途表示樂觀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播：美國務鄕馬歇爾及其隨員已於今日午後三時半乘機抵達莫斯科。同日中午法外長皮杜爾亦已抵達，蘇方僅派外次維辛斯基到車站迎迓，旣無軍樂，亦乏其他儀式，一如英外相只文於昨日抵此時然。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科九日電〕馬歇爾於下機時稱，「在此將遇困難，自無疑義，但此等困難前已予以應付，頗獲成功，深信吾人以和平之談判方法，定將獲得協議，藉以促進吾人均甚關懷之和平目的」。</p>
<p>〔聯台社莫斯科九日電〕此問人士今日益信蘇聯將提出對德方案，採取積極行動，打開四外長會議前夕各大國間之僵局。此項信念來自務方人士，頗堪注意。蘇方人士對前途能否獲致具體決定一節，咸抱相當樂觀，與英美大代表團對會議成功之機會表示悲觀者，適得其反。但蘇外次維辛斯　於歡迎英外相只文時所稱盼集於來莫斯科途中睡眠充足，蓋星期一以後，即不敢斷言云云，亦殊可玩味也。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科九日電〕四國外長會議定明日揭幕，籌備工作已積極進行。開會地點似已必在空軍俱樂部即前帝俄時代之雅爾餐館，然官方迄今尙未有所宣布。外賓下榻之處，房屋均已大事裝修，莫斯科旅館前，最新式之汽車排列成長蛇陣，都城飯店之女侍亦都易上新裝，其他若電梯司機侍應小童等，亦均換上燮排銅扣之高領新制服。文化關係協會特派能操英語之女秘書多名，駐在莫斯科旅館，其地並新添一小型商店，出售各種禮物。英國代表團人員每人每日僅可獲國外服務額外津貼五光令，舉止諒難豪闊。英文翻譯之缺乏，將爲外賓最感棘手之事。外賓所用汽車，規定每月迎司機之薪金在內，共七千處布。週一開會後，議程第一項將爲討論柏林盟管會之報吿，此一文件可以充分顯示四强意見之分歧。就蘇聯最近之當傳觀，最難解決者當爲德境英美區經濟合併之間題，蘇聯前此已有最嚴厲之抨擊，其次若德國未來之政府形式·波蘭之西疆·魯爾萊茵之命運等，均爲最麻煩之問題。至於奧國問題，雖尙有若干未曾解決之點，但料討論之際常不致有甚困難。</p>
<h3>德國和約討論五項主要難題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科八日電〕四强外長雖於去年六月間曾討論德國問題，且四强外决亦曾商談月餘，但四强外長此次仍將由最初起點，開始德國問題之討論。此次會議之結果，將決定東西國家問能否消除關於德國問題之數十項爭執，共中尤以避免德國之永久分裂爲然。英美佔領區之經濟合併一節，亦係癥結問題之一，蓋蘇聯素認此舉必致造成德國永久分裂為二。</p>
<p>此次會議程序將德國問題分爲五項主題如下：（一）「德國未來之政治機構」，美國主張建立權力散漫之德國合衆國，英國在原則上同意此點，但法國則主張德國之聯邦組織，應有最散漫之形式。（二）「德波接界之東境問題」。美國認為奧特—奈賓界綫並非最後決定，似有需要修改之處。英法兩國對此似並不如此重視。蘇聯則堅決反對修改，認爲應維持波茨坦會議所決定之臨時界綫。（三）「德國西疆問題，包括魯爾與薩爾區」，法國力主合併薩爾區，並國際管制魯爾區與萊因區。蘇聯素重視以德國現有工業作爲賠款之事，故主張四國共管　爾區，作爲和約中一項條約。（四）「賠款問題」，蘇聯擬取得價值百億美元之現有工業及生產工具作爲賠款。英美對此表示反對，法國對此或能同意，但蘇聯對法國要求必需有若干讓步。（五）「解除軍備，肅淸納粹及民主化問題」。蘇聯嚴貢西方國家並不積極致力於此，不能實現波茨坦協定。此點即爲德境四國管制委員報吿中之第一項問題。</p>
<h3>會議期間新聞自由</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科九日電〕美代表即國務院情報司長麥克杜莫特頃宣稱：余頃已接獲蘇外部情報司長辛契諾之通知，謂四外長會議期內，　　電台評論員可在莫斯科電台發表廣播。自本月十日即會議開幕日起，外籍記者拍發關於會議情形之新聞，皆可不受檢查，惟在電文上須註明「外長會議」之字樣。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社柏林八日電〕基督教民主黨領袖凱塞爾，本日在來比錫城發表談話稱，盟國對德管制委會將授權德國建立中央行政機構，故德國政府遲早必將成立云。</p>
<h3>史達林解釋德虞略錯誤</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科九日電〕史達林元帥頃函復蘇聯軍官學校敎官藍辛上校，解釋一項軍事問題。史氏稱：德國魯登杜夫將軍與季合爾元帥一前一後，導致德國兩次戰敗，絕非出於偶然。蓋德國著名軍事理論家克勞賽維資所敎導德國軍官之戰略，在兩次大戰中皆巳證明無效故也。蘇聯國父列寗所由關切克勞賽維資者，僅係研究其戰爭與政治關係之理論而已。克氏生於短兵相觸之時代中，吾人則生在機器戰爭之時代中，其區別即在於此云。</p>
<h3>法對越南問題正擬訂新政策　河內戰事岑寂與此有關</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎八日電〕新任駐越南特派員波拉特今日宣稱：法政府對於越南叛亂正擬訂新政策中。又據越南來電稱，過去二十四小時內河內未放一槍，海塘·南定等地，亦僅有小規模軍事活動。若干觀察家相信：此次戰事沉寂，或係等候法國公佈新政策。</p>
<h3>英國配備法軍從事越南戰爭</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎八日電〕此間可靠方面息：過去十六個月中，英國直接供給越南法軍之軍事配備，價值達一千七百五十萬鎊，此外根據英法最近之協議，英國將以價值一百七十六萬鎊之各種配備，包括飛機·大砲，降落傘·卡車·制服·紮營用具等供給法國，配備傘兵一師團。法國海軍，亦已向英訂購軍艦九十二艘，共計十一萬七千噸，其中大部份尙在建造之中，代傳訂共一千一百四十一萬六千元。根據一九四五年九月十日之英法協定，英國同意以足量戰貝售給法國，配備法遠東軍之步兵三師零一旅，及若干工兵及傘兵部隊。最近英國配備法傘兵一師，不在前項協定範圍以內，係法參謀總長塔西尼於去年十一月在倫敦所議定者。自戰爭結束以來，英法軍官及技術人員即從事研究雙方之軍事技術。</p>
<h3>前南王彼得被開除國籍</h3>

<h3>日共黨轉向派組勞農前衛黨</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京九日電〕日本共黨轉向派領袖佐野學，今日組成勞農前衛黨，決定選舉對策，黨　，黨約，宣言等，佐　自任中央執行委員長，風間丈吉任書記長。佐野曾任日共中央執行委員長，後在上海被捕，一九三三年在獄中聲明轉向，變爲「一國社會主義者」，主張民族優於階級。風問曾於一九三一年任日共中央執行委負長，被捕後聲明轉向</p>
<h3>對蘇談判宣吿破裂　阿根廷展開反共　美國恐懼心理渙然冰釋</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社阿根廷京城八日電〕莫斯科四國外長會議開幕期近，阿根廷政府已發動反共運動，此事與阿蘇兩國談判友善條約之決裂適在同時發生。阿根廷總統貝隆昨在議會發表演說稱，共產主義者乃爲吾國之敵人，與五年計劃之破壞者。吾國政府自一九四〇年起下令禁止共黨，至一九四五年解除禁令，現此種禁令或將隨時重新實施云。此外，阿根廷各報亦非正式暗示國家之敵人及賣國賊之活動，有被禁止之可能，並謂，營察當局已發動反共運動。按蘇聯經濟代表團前來此間談判兩國友善商務及航務條約，已於最近突然返國，此舉象徵阿蘇兩國關係已重趨緊張。美國若千人士原恐阿蘇兩國關係之改善，將使蘇聯在美洲取得立足地，但自阿根廷總統最近在議會發表聲明，闡述全國政局，並宣佈阿蘇談判決裂之後，此種恐懼心理當可冰釋矣云。</p>

<h3>匈境蘇軍下令逮人事　蘇方駁覆美搞議　否認剝奪小地主黨合法特權</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社匈牙利京城九日電〕美國於本月六日向蘇聯所提出照會，反對蘇軍當局下令逮捕匈國小地主黨前任秘書長柯伐克斯，頃由匈境蘇軍司令史維雪杜夫加以駁覆。據稱：匈牙利之秩序與民主政權，幷未遭受左派政黨之威脅，所謂剝奪小地主黨之合法特權及志在設立獨裁政權等情，皆不應責諸左派政黨。反之，一輩企圖廢止憲法及推翻共和國之陰謀份子，則在威脅匈牙利之秩序與民主政權。此在小地主黨本身亦時常承認，該黨各領袖如現任秘書長及內閣總理奈琪對此均已有所申述。倘小地主黨有多數人參預陰謀，則左派政黨及警察均不能負此責任。且參預陰謀之小地主黨員，業已服罪，其當選議員時，亦已同意禠奪其國會特權，故所稱左派政黨謀與小地主黨領袖妥協一節，實無根據。陰謀業已查明，即將提交匈牙利獨立民主法庭處理，故本人未能接受貴方所提聯合研究匃國情形及該一陰謀之建議，蓋此舉乃千涉匃牙利之內政故也。柯伐克斯因侵犯蘇聯佔領當局之合法權利，故蘇軍當局加以逮捕，貴方干涉其事，亦爲本人所不能接受。要之，蘇軍當局此舉自有罪案可據，並非軍隊干涉匈牙利之內政也。蘇聯此項覆文亦有副本送交管制會議之英國代表。</p>
<h3>韓南局勢仍極緊張</h3>
<p>李承晚態度殊愼重</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約九日電〕駐韓美國新聞處處長鄧倍前在華府參加會議，本日抵此發表談話稱：如果美國在此後數日或數週內不能設法解決朝鮮問題，則美國在亞洲之民主奮鬥必致失敗，且有失去遠東和平奮鬥之可能。霍奇將軍曾吿記者稱：美國不能允許韓南獨立政府之成立，而又不致違犯莫期科協定。翌日，蘇聯大使館新聞處主任即吿余稱：蘇聯佔領區之韓人已被准組織獨立政府，一切要職均由韓人擔任。據本月四日之漢城來電，前臨時政府又將重新成立，美國之承認與否則在所不計，而美國則稱美國決不允許其成立。故朝鮮在四十八小時之內殆將發生衝突無疑。李承晚對此曾加詳細考慮。李氏深知當時之緊張局勢將來必有造成事變之一日，故毅然致電金九，　其在李氏返韓之前，不得採取任何行動。李氏現已準備就緒，即將返國領導韓人，故和戰關　實操諸國務院與睦軍部」云。</p>
<h3>航業界新發明能使船隻不沉</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社羅馬八日電〕那不勒斯靑年那比，已將德國發明加以改進而獲得成功，可防止船隻之沉沒。據那比氏本人在「呼聲報」撰文稱：德國科學家二人前曾發明一種瓦斯，將其黏附於船尾，因其比重較水爲輕，故可防止船身沉沒。本人被拘於德國集中營時，對於此一新發明即有所聞，現已裝置一種設備，可自鈾鑛砂之混合物中製造上述瓦斯，使其發生磁性，緊黏於船尾，防止船身下沉，此種設備可裝置於任何船隻之上云。</p>
<h3>最高蘇維埃代表團蒞英　大雪紛飛阻碍活動</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦八日電〕蘇聯最高議會代表團前來英國聘問業已行抵此間，共計代表二十人，其中二代表爲女性。留在此間時，將列席下院若干次會議，至於其他計劃，則尙未決定，良以英國方面欲使蘇聯代表團，自行決定其時間表故也。蘇聯代表團各代表中有醫生·科學家·作家·礦工·電機師·詩人各一人，故其所感覺興趣之部門自極廣泛。截至目前爲止，因大雪紛飛，交通困難，故蘇聯代表團尙未有何活動。</p>
<h3>猶恐怖份子襲擊英兵營</h3>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷八日電〕猶太恐怖份十今日襲擊台拉維夫城英軍兵營與英軍司令部所在之西特魯斯大厦，與衛兵發生衝突歷七十五分鐘，城中一片火光，爆炸聲遠聞數哩。西特魯斯大厦前有軍用車兩輛被炸毁。同時海發港警察局亦遭襲擎，發生大火。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦問題由英自行討論</h3>
<p>〔中央社成功湖八日合衆電〕聯合國已將巴勒斯坦問題，直接交還英國自行討論。安理會已定十二日恢復討論美國託管前日本委任統治各島問題，並將於十日再度爭辯原一十能管制問題。</p>
<h3>亞洲西南的神秘王國　葉門局勢嚴生　老王年邁病危王子醖釀內爭</h3>
<p>〔中央社記者王公迷安哥拉七日專電〕目前世界上最爲古老與最有權力之獨裁者，現巳病人膏肓，或即將逝世，遺留若干妻兒爭奪此秘密王國之繼承權，此獨裁者係葉門國王雅海亞。渠現統治此廿世紀天方夜譚式之國家，其國土與英國之保護國亞丁接壤，該地爲保衛紅海南口之戰略要地，葉門國王及其治民不僅對於中日戰爭毫無所聞，即在華盛頓之國務院及倫敦之外務部，亦均鮮有知者。少數對該國發生興趣之人士，對雅海亞及其治民稍有認識。</p>
<p>葉門王國相當我台灣省，其人口尙不如上海市之衆，雅海並王對於其南北國土接壤之國境，亦未劃分淸楚，其南接亞丁，北隣沙地阿拉伯，國王今年已八十四歲，其獨裁權之大，視墨索里尼及希特勒猶過之無不及，上自國家大事，下至在其王國之旅行及護照簽證及外僑管理等瑣事，均親理之。換言之，其獨裁權之大，並使渠成爲其神秘王國之護照簽證官。</p>
<p>安哥拉獲悉最近葉門王國政治危機之消息，係國王之第八王子傳出，第八王子前日逃亡至亞丁，致電開羅之阿拉伯同盟總部稱：葉門國內情勢嚴重，並教促阿拉伯國家採取「緊急有效之措施，以遏止予可憐祖國人民之流血慘禍」。現第八王子已在英國保護之下，渠會受近代化敎育，思想進步。渠反對王備及父王之妻妾，蓋老王一旦逝世後，渠等均欲繼續維持其傳統之專制封建獨裁地位，此王室之內爭，實對於世界戰略形勢有相當之影響。</p>
<p>按英國於一九三四年即與業門訂立條約，繼之其他阿拉伯國家亦與葉門訂約。美國延至一九四六年始與之有訂條約關係，而我國對葉門王國素無所聞，　諭外交關係矣。葉門八十四高齡之老王，思想保守，渠認爲聯合國僅爲兒戲，故並未請求加人，而葉門王國實爲一九四五年三月間成立之阿拉伯同盟主要國家之一。</p>
<p>葉門國土雖小，共人民愛國心極强，雅海亞國王認英國屬國亞丁爲其旣失土地，曾在第一次大戰與第二次大戰之間屢次與英國發生戰爭，以圖收復失地，然終爲英國空軍所敗。雅海亞曾屢與其北鄰沙地阿拉伯王國發生衝突　一九三五年沙地阿拉伯國王進兵佔領紫門全國，至雅海亞王承認沙坤阿拉伯國王爲「威武之王」時始撤兵北返。一九四六年，葉門與美國訂的，以油田讓予美國，故老王逝世後，奮門國內政治糾紛勢不可免。</p>
<p>現可　之危機有二：第一，爲美國友人之沙地阿拉伯國王或乘新喪之際，進而佔領全境；第二，第八王子取得英美兩關之支持，以實行其近代化此紅海神秘國家之理想，而與其家族發生衝突。雖然葉門王國與我國關係遙遠，惟吾人當認識此亞洲西南一端將臨之暴風雨。</p>
<h3>美或將以經濟援助畀予希臘及匈牙利　總統今與國會領袖商討</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎九日電〕政界人士今日力言杜魯門總統顯然決定要求國會批准援助希臘及在財政上援助英國，使其維持希臘之駐軍。各該人士稱：當此莫斯科外長會議前夕，杜魯門總統決定延期視察西印度羣島，俾便硏究希臘局勢，此舉意義至爲重大。同時，英國方面亦表示無意立即自希臘　軍。杜魯門總統定十日與國會兩大黨領袖舉行會議，屆時總統不僅將說明美國對希臘之態度，幷將闡明對近東一般的態度。</p>
<p>政界及外交界人士認爲國會中雖將有相當激烈之反對，但仍將接受政府之要求。美國政府只須要求希臘設立自由份子居多數之政府及美國保有對希貸款之控制，則國會方面之疵議自然平息。至於英國向華盛頓之呼籲，頗引起此間重大揣測。美國過去認爲英國被包圍於地中海與近東的國際困難之中，賴其老成多謀及其海軍基地之組織，故較美國更具備解決問題之條件。美國此際認識英國尙未恢復其戰前地位，美國責任綦重。鑒於蘇聯之反對之日增，美國決定負起此種責任。不寗唯是，美國國會或將對於歐洲另一國家即匈牙利，畀以重大援助，亦未可必。英美與蘇聯在　國之對立，已見露骨，可以一事爲例，即美國國務院於本月六日提出抗議，反對匈境蘇聯當局逮捕匈國小地主黨前任秘書柯伐克斯，美國認爲此舉不啻干涉匈國內政，有背雅爾達協定。關於此事，蘇聯已提出措詞强硬之覆牒，駁斥美國之指責矣。</p>
<p>英駐美大使會晤艾克遜</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓八日電〕美國國務副卿艾克遜今晨與英國駐美大使殷佛傑貝爾勛爵舉行唔談，有所商討。據消息靈通人士稱：所討論之主題，殆爲希臘問題，但殷佛加貝爾勛爵本人，則拒不發表任何聲明。衆信艾克遜與殷佛加貝爾勛爵晤談，與白宮及國務院舉行秘密會議之準備　作，不無關係。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約八日電〕「組約晚報」今日戟有「美國民主希臘委員會」之整頁廣吿，反對美國干涉希臘，支持英國對希臘的侵略。「紐約太陽」報亦希望政府於決定援希以前，聯重考慮。</p>
<h3>英空軍駐港</h3>
<p>〔路透社新加坡八日電〕英航空部已撥第二〇九飛機隊駐在香港，即命名爲第二〇九香港機隊</p>
<h3>荷扣美商船缷貨後放行</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社海牙八日電〕美船「裴爾門」號爲荷海軍扣留一事，經美政府向荷提出抗議之後，該船業由荷方放行。惟據此間負責人士稱：荷政府在目前對於爪哇及蘇門答臘之出口貿易，尙無放棄其統制之意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞八日電〕荷蘭港務當局今日將上星期五扣留之美國商船「裴爾門」號上所戟三百萬美元橡膠與奎寗開始起卸。但因該船美籍水手拒絕合作，遂在武裝保護下，打開艙口二處，利用起重機，將貨物卸人唐瓊勃里克港船塢。</p>
<h3>原子彈製造　專利不能永保　宇宙綫力量尤爲驚人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：著名數學家魯斯稱：美國之原子彈東利，決不能維持五年。據稱，在五年之內，任何非工業國家，祗須有鈾的產量，均可製造原子彈。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓八日電〕據著名原子物理學家史璜，昨夜在此間全國地理學會發表談話稱，宇宙綫所發射之能力，較之原子彈能力至少强萬倍以上。在某種情形下，達一千億倍之强。但此種宇宙綫尙未能加以控制，並且在地球大氣層以外之宇宙綫來源，亦迄今尙未確悉。史瑎為巴爾托研究院院長，曾於去夏參加B二九型飛行試騐室之試騐，頗有發現。</p>
<h3>印國大黨向回盟呼籲協力消弭兩族間糾紛</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新德里八日電〕印度國大黨本日向回敎同盟呼籲，建立印度兩族間之和平及終止最近在本哲布省發生之暴動。國大黨執行委員會並要求回盟推選和平會議之代表，協力消除兩大敎間之糾紛。並於英國退出印度之前　致協議。執行委員會並已議決，向回盟提出將本哲布省分爲印回兩區之建議。該建議係國大黨向回藍略示讓步之意，回盟對此尙無迅速反響，但衆信同盟高級領袖將接受國大黨之要求。執行委員會並向印度各種族及各政黨呼籲，停止一切衝突及暴動。</p>
<p>〔中央社新德里八日電〕國大黨執委會今決議對英政府規定日期退出印度聲明表示歡迎，並邀請回盟代表與國大黨代表舉行會議，商討未來印度憲法之間題。</p>

<h3>蘇京會議傳將討論中國問題　市參會通電全國促中央交涉反對　中國之事不容他國干涉</h3>
<p>上海市參議會，為反對莫斯科外長會議討論中國問題事，昨特通電全國各省市參議會稱：「全國各省市參議會公鑒，查我國抗戰八年，仰賴　蔣主席英明領導，全國軍民堅苦奮鬥，擊潰敵人，卒獲勝利。正期勵精圖治，完成建國大業，乃以中國共產黨，蓄意掀起戰亂，阻　國策之進行，雖經馬歇爾元帥煞費苦心、幹旋調處，政府秉持寬大，曲予忍讓，而格於小共之頑梗，和談竟無成就，良可痛心。幸我政府應付時艱，惟期進於憲政，仍本旣定方針，順應人民要求，召開國大，完成制憲工作，一方面力謀戡亂，恢復交通，促進統一，裨社會安定，生產增加，另一方面擴大政府基礎，廣延全國賢達參加，以爲行憲之準備。凡此，均我政府努力之正鵠，亦為吾人所渴望者也。乃近日外傳，莫斯科四國外長會議，有提出中國問題加以討論之說。而中共及其附和之徒，亦竟作歡抑國際干涉之迷夢，誠屬該異。中國之事，中國人民有權自決，不容他國妄加千涉。過去雅爾達會議之秘密協定，遺痛猶深。無論任何國際會議，苟無中國參加，絕對不容討論中國問題。倘有片面決議，下間出自何方，中國概不受其絲毫之拘束。吾政府尤常明白宣吿態度，杜絕國際陰謀。爰經本會第一屆第二次大會決議，外間旣有風傳，應請中央速予交涉，反對莫斯科會議討論中國問題。除電請國民政府採納外，特電查照，並希貴會一致主張，爲荷。上海市參議會叩，寅佳印。」</p>

<h3>義輪一艘抵滬將載僑民返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕義輪「Scstriere」雪斯德利爾號，七日進口，由利昌公司代理，裝載義僑返國，原擬於前日駛津，搭載華北僑民，因未得我國政府准許，未能起椗。該輪所懸義國旗已改式樣，故有誤認爲法籍者。據代理之利昌公司稱：該輪係空輪來滬，除專載僑民返國外，不擬裝戟任何物品，外傳裝運豆子四千件赴義之說，實屬不確。</p>

<h3>高士愚考察歸來　談歐美紡織概況　努力硏究鼓勵生產　我國生絲亟應改良加強輸出</h3>
<p>獲有英國紡織染理學士，曾在中央機專執敎，兼任重慶樂山民治紡染公司總經理高士愚，於去年四月間，親赴歐美，對戰後紡織事業之槪况，作綜合性之考察，高氏甫於七日由美搭麥連納斯號郵船返國抵滬，記者昨走訪高氏於寓邸，詢問此行經過，及其感想。</p>
<p>人造羊毛加緊生產</p>
<p>高氏首稱：英國爲毛紡織事業先進國家，戰後亟圖恢復以前產量，但一時未能達到，其原因實以人力缺乏，分佈於各佔領區域者，未能全部復員所致。對毛紡織事業，目前雖未獲較大之拓展，然整個事業，確已進入新趨勢。英人刻已努力研究人造纖維，幷用花生仁爲原料，製造人造羊毛，在人浩纎維改進方面力使原料加强，吸收水份毛孔，較透明膠質體之蠶絲，更爲暢適，且售價低廉。此種纖維，更可作爲羊毛代用品，過去出品，以戰時關係，一度停頓，預計明年度英國人浩羊毛，當可加緊生產。</p>
<p>罷工風潮絕無僅有</p>
<p>關於管理推銷方面，英以園以傳統性習慣罷工風潮絕無僅有，又以社會福利組織極爲週密，工人每年所得，在二百五十鎊以下，均須强迫受社會保險，死亡疾病，得有相當保障，生活可以安定。至推銷之對象，則爲：（一）殖民地，（二）歐陸，（三）南美，（四）遠東，（五）本國。以利益言，自以南美較歐陸爲優，惜以環境所驅，寗舍南美而就歐陸。英國爲島國，農產物咸感先天不足，本國島縮衣節食，加强輸出，換取外匯，肉食鷄蛋等，均受管制。目前加拿大建設猛晋，尤以渥太華爲最，惜以地廣人稀，將來發展未可限量。主要產物，爲利用森林，製造紙漿，除半數充作造紙原料外，其餘均將供給製造人絲。目前該項供應品，大有駕乎瑞典之上。</p>
<p>美棉產量尤為龐大</p>
<p>美國戰後，紡織事業，極爲興盛，棉花產量尤爲龐大，政府更高瞻遠矚，鼓勵農民生產，將產品預作假定限價，屆時價格如跌至限價內，統由政府收買。改良畜牧，已收成效，產品可與澳洲媲美，數量尙感不足。人造纖維成績最佳，完全以合成方法製造，而以煤炭爲主要起點成爲有彈性之尼能（Nylon）織維。最高超一種，幾與眞絲相等，幷分連續性及高度棉花維兩種，其成本可低於眞絲一倍至兩倍左右，其耐久性則超越數十倍以上，認爲缺憾者，僅爲不及眞絲溫暖耳。</p>
<p>美願對我協助建設</p>
<p>至此，高氏復述生絲爲吾國主要輸出品，自應改良，然值此世界競相提倡人造絲·人造羊毛之際，亦應急起直追，不能忽略。管理方面，高氏則稱：美國雖不時有勞究糾紛，惟爭態並不嚴重，其　結所繫：（一）待遇不及戰時優越，引起不滿，（二）一部份微有積蓄者，暫度優游生活，俟儲蓄金盡，再行工作。結果罷工時期，勞資雙方受損頗大，而獲利者，反爲一般商店，乘機漲價。推銷方法，恰與英國相反，以供應本國爲第一，剩餘者，方向海外發展。美國方面，對我國工業建設，極感興趣，且極願從旁協助，蓋中國工業建設如獲成就，美在遠東商業地位，即可因此而獲得永久性之基礎也。至對我國最近經濟措　改　匯率，據一般美經濟家之看法，認爲中國鼓勵出品，換取外匯，將來外匯增多，美貨自可源源輸出，自比外匯估竭，更爲靈活流通。</p>
<h3>檢察官打拳　丁同駿義務敎授</h3>
<p>上海地方法院撿察處首席檢察官黃亮，近鼓勵該處同仁，謂：「打拳可以強健身體，希望各能利用公餘時間，從丁同駿檢察官練習」。</p>

<h3>交通路側男屍查係菜販被殺</h3>

<p>新疆路天保里北弄一垃圾桶旁，昨日上午十一時許，有人發現一約二歲女嬰，遺棄在旁，經仔細察看，其左手血跡股然，兩指已遭斫斷，觀者議論紛紛，有云爲後母毒害，有謂係私子，經送市立第四醫院檢騐，斷定該嬰患結核性腦膜炎，至下午四時，不治身死。北站警局得悉，派巡官劉子常調查，知該嬰手指爲利器所傷，揣測係舊俗迷信，斬斷病嬰之指，以免下次再來討債。</p>
<h3>戴粹倫接辦交響樂團　肩荷藝術新使命　計劃每半月演奏一次票價特低用歌劇方式獲取普遍敎育意議</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕具有六十餘年歷史的上海交響樂國，在人們的腦筋裏，是有深刻印象的。該團在戰前常有盛大的演奏，即在前年勝利時市府自敵僞手中接收過來以後，去年一年中也常有公開的演奏。由於經費的限制和人事的變動，最近兩個月，該團暫時停止了練習和演奏的活動。</p>
<p>該團不僅具有悠久的光榮歷史，且是遠柬方面唯一而最具規模的管弦樂組織。在工部局時代，是它的極盛期間，多少慕名的國際管弦樂名手，川流不息的到上海來，參加該團演奏，所遺憾的是因爲它對於入選的標準很高，國人能够獲選入團的，幾十年來，不過幾個人。把它作爲一個有閒者消磨時間的對象看，巳往它那昂貴的票價和失去了教育意義的作風，我們不去說它。如說把它作爲一個晋遍的正當音樂敎育和訓練我國管弦樂人材的機關，凡是對於音樂藝術有認識而且愛好者，是應該贊成使它繼續存在並予以極力扶助，發揚光大的。</p>
<p>不辭勞瘁毅然受命</p>
<p>吳市長把這一點看得很重要，所以在今日市政經費萬分拮据的情形下，他仍決心每月拿三千萬元來維持該團的存在，並巳委託上海　專校長戲粹倫（見圖）出任該團新主任，這是說這個交管樂團，從現在起肩負起了藝術敎育的新使命</p>
<p>粹倫已往是僅有幾個國人中參加該團演奏的一位，他對於它的過往，尤其是團中的人事關係，特別的熟悉。吳市長這次一再誠懇的邀請他出來帮忙，在他自已爲着上海音專的校務，精力時間已經不堪繁劇，家人都不願他再增加過份的操勞，可是他知道如該團不幸倒下去了，如再想建立像現在這樣的一個交響樂團，在中國至少還得二十年。因爲該團的樂器和人材，就是在國際間，也是不可多得的，尤其是樂譜方面，許多貴重的名曲，現在已經絕版了。</p>
<p>演奏收入充作基金</p>
<p>爲了這一個簡單的信念，他毅然答應了吳市長的委託，接辦六個月，決定於今日到團接事。</p>
<p>在一個臨近街頭的精緻樓應裏，記者聽到詳述該團的往事，針對着過去的毛病。他說：將來接事後首先要使該團的樂師們得到合理的安定生活，在這方面，他巳經請准市長每月給三千萬元外，以後的演奏收入，全部充爲該團的基金，他計劃以後每半月演奏一次，把票價定得特別的低廉，使一般學生和市民都有聽演奏的機會，爲了歡迎國際貴賓和特別的演奏票價，不妨定得高一點。以他過去在重慶的經騐，他並計劃用歌劇的方式，來遵取普遍的敎育意義。爲了演奏能够得到預期的效果，他將要求每個禮拜練習四次的時候，每位樂師都能遵守必要的紀律。</p>
<p>下月起，我們將再會聽到該團的演奏，等着，這是一個新的聲音！</p>

<p>公革命黨之元功也，請先於革命黨史求之。當同盟會初起，同志中提出一義，相爲咨畫，即革命全屬破壞性，人才傾注於斯，學問必荒，將來須建設時，有否才器不敷肆應之虞是也；則有主張人才中分爲二，任革命者專事實行，任建設者專事學問，釗適因瀏醴之役，敗亡日本，自審衝擊非已長，請赴英倫修學以待時。卒之志行薄弱，學無所得，血革命重要階段，都未參與，以致行事遠落諸同志之後。至諸同志者，以力有顓注，未　深造。民初議法興治，又塙未免捉衿見肘之愛，初未料有內地才傑，異軍特起，如公其人。以百粤之秀質，誕育於九江之通都，少理舊文，長通世故，與故主席林公子超志趣相侔，表襄唱和，陽事捭闔，陰結賢豪，在辛亥之前欺年，長江一帶，已儼然向滿洲政府樹立一種子遍地堅不可撼之敵國，凡此皆公聞中山光生之風，自然翕合，受同盟會之檄令，奉行唯謹，武昌之義旗一舉，九江且先上海而響應，凡實厚者聲大，物理之常，無怪其然。時公剛逾弱冠，英氣　發，志在澄淸，橫厲無前，雖任軍政府外交部長，及江西全省代表，赴京出席約法會議，躬預臨時大總統選舉，而以猾臣盜國，其機已露，孫公謙退，功敗垂成，公意殊不屑也。癸丑撓敗，同人奔亡，知姦匿暫不可與爭鋒，則遵養時晦，篤志向學，近世政治經濟兩科之學與術，公務來於此取精而用宏者，舉在斯時寢饋日本明治大學得之。不久又赴美洲，以鼓吹倒袁爲職志，朝親壇宇，夕味帷燈，所學又進於前。無何，係公以大元帥開府廣州，召公爲參軍，旋改大本營參軍長，未幾，易任全省警務處長，兼廣州市公安局長，一時奸宄歛迹，盜風寢衰。公之敷展理劇長長，自茲始，加以粤東革命新市平林之地，爲敵我攻守必爭之區，內　潛滋，客軍充物，　延數年，大元帥支拄其間，不得如公爲之左右手，斟酌因應，指揮若定，其變亂將至若何程度而止，無從推知；就中以陳烱明之叛逆，開古今犯上作亂未有之局，剗治允非易易。當公以警衛軍司令隨　大元帥北伐，師次韶關，省城商團，忽受洋奴嗾使，結連土匪，大舉叛變，大元帥獨猗畀公，親書手令，立遣回師戡亂，公則劍及屨及，不失晷刻，率數千人，一夜馳抵會城，撫剿兼施，俄頃亂戢，公之臨危制變，　機立斷類如此。民國十三年，國民黨改組，公奉命與廖仲愷孫科諸同志，從事擘劃，壁　嶄新，公出任臨時中央委員，並代廣州衛戍司令，尋兼廣州市黨部執行委員，工人宣傳肯年等部部長，合黨政軍於一手，發揚光大，措置裕如，公之宏規偉　，復於是焉見之。北伐吿　，俊又雲興，　益益爲時屬望，迭肩大任；十七年，　令　勞東北軍，塞外苦寒，寒暑表墜零下卅五度下，顧公從公于邁，喜氣洋溢，來往於齊齊哈爾扎蘭諾爾博克岡諸氷天雪地問，夷夏臚歡，行所無事，古之博望，　以加焉；時遼瀋初受國命，明夷未融，北府政士，顧少川羅鈞任之流，遠難　集，釗亦以都講北陵大庠，皂帽徜徉，統一之業，懸於一髮；公以中央大員，居中策畫，密參幕府，明接羣僚，一笑一嚬，都含大義，游讌之際，動見精慶，如是者二三年，國家無東顧之憂，中外舉同仇之實；俄而九一八，俄而一二八，此次大戰之前幕啓矣。釗知公之而在初元，知公之心在此頃，凡誠則明，凡明則誠，公實兼而有之。上海華戎萃處，號稱難治，海通來次殖民地化，習俗與木邦迴　。奸商　民，儼形爲一種不可驟撼之惡勢力，爲治化梗。公爲市長，從而因革損益，動叶夫中，善者好之，不善者亦不惡，孰嗣之歌，至今洋洋弗衰。允足使人眷念者，公下車兼旬，即　虹橋之亂，就中輯和軍民，儲胥無匱，使此首創强敵之東南戰役，永爲國光，公之所耗心力幾何，何可槩量。其後五六年間，公經營大上海，擘畫市中心區，調集人力物力，併於一嚮，宏規聿起，欣欣向榮，眼見弁冕東亞之第一都會，足與古之靈臺比烈，面蘆溝之變起矣。抗戰初期，公移長粤政，以桑梓之敬恭，爲甘棠之憇芨，經權並重，戰守有方，釗曾以漠河內守吳公治平第一狀公，雅非虛語。無如敵勢兇很，海疆告危，大勢所趨，自非一手足之烈所能抗拒。適中央黨治重新，董理有待，公遂人長本部記室，駕輕就熟，擅羊叔予輕表　帶之風，緩急應機，弛張合度。自有黨以來，總持中樞，輯和徒衆，說理范義，中邊俱澈，久於其任，而允孚人望者，舍公更屬伊誰。在此期間，公會奉派宣慰海外，歷訪新嘉坡庇南及荷屬各巨埠，將中央德意，　領袖抗敵主旨若步驟，委曲申述，如醍醐然，灌輸僑衆人人之腦中。果也，星　所至，風行草偃，義聲一振，諸效畢臻，人爭內渡爲祖國服役，輸金亦泉湧　發，唯恐不及。國家以使節駛南洋，從事宣揚，旣史無前例，而南洋之輸誠於國，人款　集，如斯役規模之大，復自來所未聞，　非公者於蔫斡運，於焉亭毒，斯豈莫之爲而爲，莫之致而致者耶，噫嘻。公　歷內外，疲精敝神，入此歲來，年登六十，而國事更劇，倚畀益服，公筆不停披，口不輟講，以藥代餌，以夜繼日，求獲片刻之閒暇而不可能，旬日以前，患高血壓症，求醫於滬，遵醫囑靜臥十許日，未嘗見客，頻行見訪，執釗手日，此兩週來，爲吾夢寐中之息壤，平生實未或久曠所職如此度也，釗爲憮然久之。釗於公學不同方，政不同黨，相交逾三十年，淡焉如君子之水，積年不見，仍摯焉若傾蓋之舊，嘗相與上下議論，從不以私害公，亦不以公害私，以釗平視人倫，妄爲月旦，如公勞不廢學，逸不廢事，本位育之偉抱，協經權之大宜，行已接物，悉如邏輯之分，求之並世，曠乎寡　；而凡盡瘁干黨，矢忠於國，尙不與焉。夙昔偏執一見，以謂學問事業，未可同時並營者，眞如　鴻不足與於鵾鵬之大，轍鮒無從爲語江海之寬；倘蘇子瞻生於今日，得與公接，於推挹韓范之餘，定謂已盡天下之大觀而無恨已。釗持此見以復於潘君，由潘君更復於千餘同志，賣其相視莫逆，　然一聲，　於登堂之頃，揚　之前，對衆稱說，得公徼笑也乎。是爲序。</p>

<h3>體育館人山人海　華聯再勝哥倫布</h3>

<p>哥倫布　稍遜一籌</p>
<p>勃老福，愛許，柯柏，白納脫，勃魯齊爲下半時上塲陣容，與上半時開始相同，勃魯齋每自右方突擊，兩球輕易得之，震中籃下兩次因角度不對，俱成虛擲，但一起反彈，傳球給學崇投入，功過相抵。成章俄又中籃，勃魯齊殺入，成廿八比廿。震中一擲一罰，雙管齊下，三十一比廿二，仍差九分，特林華替出白老福，華聯呌第三次暫停。李震中一球軋籃柄，愛許跳起，手比籃圈還高。美軍在急追中直進，愛許勃魯齊中的，三十三比廿八，愈追愈近，祗差五分。松園及勃復互顯顏色，依然差五分，李犯規，勃因神經太緊張，二罰悉空無所得，形勢顯示緊張。學崇愛許各中（三八—三二），包投臨時，對方犯規，球中，罰又中，平添三分，四十一比三十四。任相成犯規畢業，張良雄上塲，三十秒內功勞簿上，即記二分，李震中與勃上下其手，四十五比四十祗存三分鐘，張建第二功，四七比四二時，華聯第四次暫停，四七比四二愛許畢業，克羅斯調入，四十七比四十二，結果華聯僅勝五分。</p>

<p>〔本報南京九日電〕榮獲本年度滬女子籃球聯賽錦標之綠隊九日在京首次出馬，即以十七對十三之比數，壓倒首都勁旅勵志隊，傳球之美妙，守衛之堅强，予全塲五千觀衆，以深刻印象，而黃明媛劉珍竇二人之精彩表演，尤令人嘆爲觀止。</p>
<p>勵志一分領先</p>
<p>球賽於下午三時二十分許開始，綠隊出塲者黃明媛，容淑儉，李蘊芝，劉珍寳，王維珍，吳愛蓮，伍美英，勵志隊則以最精銳之陳白雪，陳金釵，劉守光等應戰，裁判聞宗元。勵志得地利之宜，綠隊不慣室外作戰，勵志首開紀錄，明媛等數度反撲，皆以求勝心切，未能中鵠。無何，勵志又中一球，錄隊陣中，敵騎縱橫，形勢殊見危急，幸賴明媛於敵人叢中，投入一球，打破鴨蛋，第一節勵志以四比二領先。嗚鑼再戰，綠隊全師猛攻，珍竇罰球未入，明媛投籃落空，而勵志諸將，又捲土重來，兩分鐘內投籃達十一次之多，最後終爲其投人一球，紀錄牌上高懸六比二，綠隊忙呼停戰，共商韜略。再戰聲起，綠隊前鋒奮勇作戰，迭有美妙傳球，明媛罰中一球，形熱稍見好轉，旋明媛又罰中，演成各六局面，上半時完舉，勵志隊以七比六佔先一分。</p>
<p>綠隊扶搖直上</p>
<p>下半時開始，大局仍在對方控制之下，然上海諸將，究係慣戰能征，三號九號在勵志陣地中，滿塲穿梭，成各九平手後，分數即扶搖直上，明媛之準確投籃，予對方莫大威脅，扳成十五比九絕對優勢。勵志雖頻頻換將，然大勢已去，而滬隊諸將則於此時，儘量表現其擋人法等新式戰略，使勵志諸將，眼花撩亂。最後客軍以十七對十三獲勝。論功行賞，明媛獨得十分，應獲首功，珍竇似未臻最佳狀態。聞綠隊在京，尙有比賽，惟隊員以假期關係，決定星期一夜快車返滬。</p>

<h3>籃邊散記</h3>
<p>籃球友誼賽，華聯哥侖布再戰，昨夕市體育館人滿爲患，不下於羣聲到滬時之盛况。</p>
<p>華聯以大李·阿弟·學崇·老包·相成出塲，是最堅強的陣容，相成雖不擅射，但遠傳近遞，尺度合拍，華聯昨賽遂益形活躍，再勝哥侖布。</p>
<p>大李仍居領導人物，覓隙疾傳，使學崇·阿弟與老包獲分，阿弟和老包，目前均在最佳狀態中，老包的攔截，阿弟之搶刦，令人贊賞，學崇之籃下工夫，漸復舊日水準。</p>
<p>哥侖布最大弱點爲傳球無技術，常被華聯中途攔刦，投籃技藝，也未達佳妙之境，僅右衛柯柏能盤善射，中鋒白老福尙差強人意。</p>
<p>上半時，華聯曾以十八比七，二十三比十二佔絕對優勢，下半時四十一比三十四時，任相成五次犯規出塲，張良雄入替，上陣即顯遠射顏色。</p>
<p>李震中距終塲十分鐘時，已顯疲態，大約是連日過份賣力之故。</p>
<p>按昨晚之陣容及演出，華聯可勝海陸靑三球。（昌年）</p>
<h3>東華九戰九勝再度擊敗蘇聯</h3>
<p>龍海幼良下半時各中一球</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕東華繼續保持其常勝記錄，昨再度擊敗蘇聯，造成甲組賽九戰九勝之光榮紀錄，上半時蘇聯抗拒甚力，雙方未有所獲，下半時龍海幼良各中一球，奠定勝局。昨日逸園球迷，八千餘人，情況頗為熱烈。雙方陣容錄後：</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>張邦綸　莊友仁　張林根　韓龍波　鐔福楨　林文虎（下）　於洽興（上）　李垚　孫錦順　韓龍海　陳明哲（上）　於洽興（下）　賈幼良</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>鮑賽維區　卡洛列區　谷托夫　沙樂寗　捷林谷夫　鐵伏尼諾高洛夫　格里納司　勞勃司托夫　却畢谷夫　勃郎（下）　卡普司汀（上）</p>
<p>相持不下</p>
<p>裁判陳吉祥，巡邊樂秀榮何春輝，鳴笛開賽，蘇聯先攻，小黃毛來襲，福楨斷住去路，格里納司再犯，東華腹地，敵騎縱橫，小黃毛射門未中，東華反攻，亦未見功，八分鐘時，龍海探陣，又告野逸，未幾，賈幼良邊角切中，落點甚佳，龍海迎頭一頂，惜乎太高，老孫射門，爲鮑賽維區撲出，雙方僵持不下，達二十分鐘。廿五分鐘時，幼良明哲舅甥位置互易，約經五分鐘，明哲底綫傳中，錦順鐵腿失靈，球從谷托夫身上彈出，將近上半終塲時，賈幼良與卞洛列區互撞，幼良受傷，上半時結束，〇比〇各無所獲。</p>
<p>連中二球</p>
<p>易地再戰，東華前鋒挺進，環攻不捨，五分鐘時，孫老錦傳中，龍海於離門五碼處，輕撥入網，一比〇，東華紀錄首開。蘇聯痛失首城，傾師反攻，林根友仁左右招架，應付從容，十五分鐘時，孫老錦又施妙計，幼良小傳右翼，惜乎明哲未能把握時機，混戰多時，蘇聯無法得逞，變更陣綫，格里納司調任右內鋒，却畢谷夫任右翼，卡普司汀改左內鋒，果見活躍，奈東華後衛嚴密防守，未有差池。卅一分鐘時卡普司汀傷臂下野，勃郎入補，東華乘虛而入，錦順猛叩，中谷托夫彈回，幼良反身一勾，皮球又入網內，成二比〇，是時林文虎入替陳明哲，但未幾終塲，笛聲已起，東華以二比〇再克蘇聯，造九戰九勝偉績。</p>

<h3>進出口業公會理事葉序馨　對連銷制提供意見　建議組織進出口外滙審委會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕進出口連鎖制，近來本市進出口界偶導甚力。昨日進出口業公會理事葉席　，對進出口連鎖制提供實施意見書，略謂：中國進出口同業之業務，現已瀕危境。推其　結，則出口業因國內物價日漲，高於國外市價，輸出之國貨難得善估；而進口業則因我國政府所供給正式商民應用之外匯頭寸甚少，而所有人口外匯申請書，常被當局延擱數月不理，以致不得不將契約作廢，而其電訊等費用，已損失不貲。然物價之高漲及外匯頭寸之缺少，在我社會，在我政府，亦有其不得已之苦衷。國內　局一日不澄淸，則我商民一日不得解除此項痛苦。事實如此，則在此過渡時期內，我商民自不得不另　別法以維营業，此即提倡連銷法之由來也。連銷法即係任商民於出口業所取得之外匯，用於進口業所需之頭寸；換言之，即商民之進口所需及出口所　之外匯頭寸，須自相軋平。我國向為入起，即進口所需之頭寸，超過出口所取得之頭寸。若採取此連鎖法，則無形中迫使商民減少比陵不急需之外貨進口，而另一方面鼓動人民努力於推廣輸出，以爭取外匯，其法之善，在國在民，莫甚於此。</p>
<p>然此連鎖法若辦理不當，則共流弊亦可造成不堪設想之局面。其一，在國內可使外匯價値抬高，造成黑市外匯；蓋我國旣然是一入超國家，則我國進口商勢必競相努力收集外匯頭寸，竟或不惜暗中增値，以遂其購得之願；如此，黑市外匯發生矣。其中，為急欲求得外匯以付其進口貨之價，或有不惜將出口貨貶値出售，無形中將國外市塲上之我國貨價使之降落。在此情形之下，商人同時經營進出；者，以進口貨之利益，抵補出口之損失，或尚能支持；然僅營出口者，則無法維持，勢非完全停業，或以次貨矇混。如此豈非影響我國整個在國外市塲之信譽。故實行此連鎖法，而欲得良好之結果，則非有一週密之管理機構不可，今以愚見略提數則，以供參考。</p>
<p>（一）出商品，須依政府　價出售。但此限價，須依到達地之市價為標準。一在此限價之下，即不准輸出。如此可免除進出口商貶値求售，影響國外市塲。此限價可由政府根據我國國外商務官報吿隨時公佈之</p>
<p>（二）為鼓勵輸出物資起見，政府應儘量予運輸上以便利，並應予極低利之貸款。</p>
<p>（三）為維持我國信譽及免除商人以次貨矇混起見、商品儉騐工作實應加强，並須詳細分別規定輸出貨物之等級及標準。檢騐工作應延聘每業專家，負責參加。「因非業中人不能洞悉該業之利弊，且進出物資亦得易於查訪。」</p>
<p>出口商能達到此目的，則對輸出數量當可增加，目更能取得較多之外匯頭寸。</p>
<p>（四）所有由輸出得來及進口配出之外匯數目，應每週在報上公佈，以堅商民之信仰。</p>
<p>（五）出口所得之外匯，除政府留用百分之幾外，其餘則可任商人請求，運用於進口方面。</p>
<p>（六）組織一迎鎖法進出口外匯審核委員會，除政府機關推派代表外，全國商聯會上海市商會及進出口公會均得推代表參加。</p>
<h3>汕商業同業公會　昨開成立大會</h3>

<h3>紡建增加　收購國棉數量</h3>

<h3>浙茶產量未復　廠行交易寂寥</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州九日電〕茶葉為浙省大宗特產之一，產區遍及全省，戰時外銷滯阻，產量銳減，至今尚未恢復，上年產銷情形，據農業改進所調查統計，產數二十七萬四千担，內外銷總數的十萬祖，較戰前減少四分之三，全省茶廠一百卅餘家，茶行八十餘家，上年終結算，十九虧折，茶行已有五十餘家倒閉。目前因茶市未到，及時局關係，交易寥寥，行家開市，毛茶大方四十八萬至七十萬，旗槍五十萬至六十萬，烘靑四十萬至四十三萬，江紅三十萬，凈茶龍井每斤上等八萬，中等三萬，次等八千至一萬。</p>

<h3>美元支配下　世界通貨現勢　希望多購得美國貨物所以都有人為的官價</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約九日電〕本期「新聞週刋」分析世界通貨形勢。略謂：當前有三大貨幣區戒，即美元·蘇聯盧布·與英國金鎊。瑞士法郎在技術上，雖較美元為堅定，但美元的支配貨幣世界，因為其可以購買美國工業出品。目前各國官定的匯兌率，都為人造性質，與自由市塲匯率，大不相同。國際貨幣基金國去年十二月成立時，二十二國所報的官定匯率，都不能眞正照其表面價値接受。因為每一國家都希望購員美國貨物，多多益善，故為其通貨規定一種人工的官價。例如紐約貨幣市塲中，英金每鎊値美金二·九八元，埃及金鎊價格相同，官價則英鎊値四·〇三三美元，埃及金鎊値四·一五美元。澳洲金鎊官價三·二二美元，實價二·五五美元。其他各國貨幣亦遠較官價為低。茲以一美元為單位，將各國貨幣之官價與自由市塲價格對照如下：</p>
<p>官價　自由市塲</p>
<p>比利時法郞　四二·八　五八</p>

<h3>蘇浙皖絲業今劃之比較</h3>

<h3>英代表將赴美商購日本棉布</h3>
<p>〔路透社孟徹斯德八日電〕茲悉英國貿易局代表不久將前往華感頓，商談英國向美國購買日本織造棉布五千萬碼計劃之最後細節。貿易局擬將該項棉布之加工手續在蘭開夏省完成，然後運往以糧食及原料供給英國之各國。美國在最近數月中曾以大量棉花供給日本，織造棉布。查戰前蘭開夏省每年輸出棉布七十億碼，其中五千萬碼係輸往日本，今則英國因生產减少，乃不得不購買日本織造之棉布矣，此間紡織業及運輪業人士對此咸表駭異不置</p>
<h3>一九四七年　美國工業展望</h3>
<p>— 本報室特譯</p>
<p>增產結果物價當能降低</p>
<p>一九四七年可能為不景氣年的恐懼，已漸漸消除，接踵而來的，是本年度將　續繁榮的新為望。工業界領袖們正在革擬打破耙錄的增產計劃。同時產生一種信念，認為多年受高物價巨浪打擊的消費者，今日當可分事國家繁榮的福社。多數經濟學家預料增產結果，物價必逐漸下降。</p>
<p>各種工業所擬定的本年度活動計劃，對於生產的增加一致表示樂觀。鋼鐵業預計在本年內生產鋼鐵九千萬噸，可獲凈利美金三十億元。汽車製造業已經確定了本年內製造汽車五百萬輛的目標，並希望超過此數。據可靠的估計，在今後兩三年內，新車的需求量將超過供應量。</p>
<p>美國鐵路因運費增加百分之一七·六，的可增加收入一百萬美元，刻正大最投資，添量新設備。用具製造商希望本年度能應付鉅大的需要量。他如飛機製造業，無綫電，電力，石油，煤氣，化學原料，建築材料，等工業，前途大致均可樂觀。</p>
<p>專家預料：各種工業的增產計劃個能一一付諸實行，那麼消費者當可分享其利。他們預料一九二〇年的物價下跌情形，將　見於今日，該年也是戰後第二年，和一九四七年一樣，上半年物價漲　最高峯，其後即吿回跌，逐步下降甚速。到年底時，紡織物的價格已跌去一半，糧食下跌四分之一，製造品下跌五分之一。</p>
<p>當時物價下跌的原因，是生產量的激增和消費者對於高物價的抵抗，即拒買運動。現在這兩種因素也正向着同一的目標發生作用。經濟學家指出目前的生產量比較一九二〇年的增加兩倍以上。多數經久耐用的商品，雖然還不容易購得，但是不久批發商可有剩餘的商品出售。生產量足敷應付需要的例子，己經數見不鮮，不再贅述。</p>
<p>單單生產量的提高，對於壓平物價已是一枝生力軍，如果再加以消費者拒買的支援，那就形成一種威力無比的武器。至少在美國，消費者的拒買，並不是民衆有組織的一種運動，大部分却由於無力購賢使然，所以它的效果更大。因為一個人旣然無力購買一件東西，那麼無論威脅利誘都不會削弱他的抵抗力的。能够說服他的，只有實行削價，以適合他的財力。不過工業界能否依照　定的生產計劃順利進行，引起物價的下跌，那大半要看勞工界的情形是否平靜無事而定。要是像去年那樣的罷工再來一下，局面也許全然不同了。</p>
<p>共和當在美國會中佔優勢的事實，是對於生產有利的。因為它使政治情勢大為改進，並將採取核减國家支出而扶助商業的步驟。</p>
<p>此外，美國民衆購買力的增高，是使本年度工業前途樂觀的另一因素，因為市民購買力的提高，足以增加貨物的需求量。</p>
<p>工業界希望一九四七年的勞資關係可望改進。一般人認為勞工對於罷工漸感嫌惡。同時民衆及國會對於罷工均表情慨，故一九四七年的罷工損失可望减少。</p>
<p>在另一方面，批發價和生活費雖然增高，據官方發表的數字，一九四七年初批發價較去年六月漲起百分之三十，生活費漲起百分之十五，但大勢所趨，顯然不久即將回跌。經濟學家提出警吿，在生產超過需要的時會即將來臨以前，物價愈高，其反動亦愈連，因為過去大量擴張的生產品，若不設法銷售，必將影會到當前的生產過程。</p>
<p>經濟學家在研究各種有利及不利因素以後，得到一個結論，即一九四七年的情形常較一九四六年為有利，耐久物工業較前更發達，不耐久物工業則略見遜色。</p>
<h3>桐油的增產與輸出</h3>
<p>— 章柏菴</p>
<p>經八年之苦戰，我國唯一之出口物資—桐油，已衰退到不能想像了！</p>
<p>各產桐區經過大戰之後，桐樹之頻頻砍伐，到現在全國年產金，據估計平均僅及戰前百分之卅五，其經過淪陷的區域，桐樹更少。未淪陷的區域，更以當年貿委會在統購統銷的控制之下，使桐油價値作極不合理的抑低，桐農無利可圖，恰値糧食在漲之情形下，紛紛砍桐値糧。逮後海口封鎖，無法輸出，桐油除供少量的改製汽油外，其餘唯一的出路，僅作鄉間燈油燃料之用。出口無路，價格自低，所以別的植物油可以跟着其他土產上漲，而桐油盡是厄運綿綿，無從抬頭。</p>
<p>勝利之前，貿委會收購積存之桐油，以海路阻塞，桐油紛紛出籠，瀕勝利前，各地每祖平均價的為三萬元，勝利以後，復以海岸儲幣二百作一，而折合國幣，數字突增。例如以三萬元一担桐油計，儲幣價即為六千萬元，而此時海岸之桐油價格，決不上六千萬元，所以桐油價格，反而見低。上年春，出口呈現復活，價亦冉冉上升，後以外價旣低，匯率又短，及至上年年底，以廣州方面走私猖獗，正規輸出，已頻絕境，出口商成了半失業狀態。</p>
<p>上述過程，產量旣極度退化，轍出復蒙其影響，以致中國的大好輸出物資，陷於悲慘的境地。</p>
<p>本年春，輸廣會己引起了大大的注意，可是八年來的積重難返，不是短時期能够挽回得了。所以今後國外市塲之桐油推銷，與夫國內之增產問題，實為當務之急。</p>
<p>那末我們今後將怎樣去增產呢？據大陸報載，認為只有用高價去吸引，使桐農一反過去之消極，而達到生產量有急速之增加，（見大陸報美聯社二月廿日電訊。）我們亦認為這個方法很對，但是現在欲使桐油外價蓋力下挫，內價無限制的上漲，這是不可能的。</p>
<p>唯一的辦法，只有從减低成本上着想，免費運送及銀行低利貸做押匯，這是比較可以做到的。因為凡是國營交通工具，都可以免費輸送，是於運費當可减少不少，在國家收入來說，可以說為數有限，而產區與出口海岸之流動性能，將大大的增加。同時以其高昂之運費，轉移於桐晨，油價亦即無形提高。</p>
<p>至於出口商人，每以在國內交通被阻之情形下，運輸時間及高利負荷，不勝負担。倘能由銀行低利貸做押匯，則出口前途，當非目前可比。第一是利息負荷减輕了，第二是在資金流轉上不會經年累月地壓住，當於出口運銷，起了雙重的效用。</p>
<p>其次：我們要知道國外市塲對於我國桐油之需要，即將激增，此點美聯社亦曾加以說明，「據桐油專家稱：中國之桐油質地較其他工業油類為佳，惜乎中國之煉油方法太陳舊了，如能應用外國科學煉油方法將可减低生產成本，並改良其油質。」業者曾搜集了許多國外桐油的代替品之資料，但一句話：桐油是桐油，我國桐油的質地，由於土貿的關係，是駕凌了任何代替品，我國桐油之吸收　氣，比任何乾性油為强，因之桐油之出口前途，並不黯淡。反之，今後更應從製煉方法；增加產量兩點，大大地努力，國外桐油市塲，將重入我手。改進品質應該由中國植物油料廠來負責進行，增產遝動，地方政府，亦宜列為攷續之一。</p>
<p>上年桐油之輸出量為四五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇磅，較之廿五·廿六年之平均數二〇九·一〇〇·〇〇〇磅，僅及五分之一。但據若干方面估計，在二年以內，輸出量不會超過六千五百萬磅，若果如此，這是够我們洩氣了。我們以為時間與空間的爭取，是靠人來努力的，如果當局再不急起直追，則這注大量外匯，就無形地拋棄了。而今後再圖爭取國外市塲殊非易易。上面的辦法，是一個輕而易舉的辦法，願當局攷慮採納。</p>

<h3>離婚城</h3>
<p>在一個民主的國度裏，隨時隨地都看得見「標新立異」的人物，標新立異的企業，乃至於標新立異的城市。雷諾，這座以「離婚起家」的小城，靜靜地躺在納伐達州的落磯山的一角。</p>
<p>我在旅行加利福尼亞的歸途中訪問雷諾，在那座奇怪的小城裏，我帶着新奇的眼光，留戀了四天。據雷諾人自己說，他們住在全世界最大的一座小城市裏邊。旅客們從火車站一下車，在走進大街的路口，便看得見一座富麗堂皇的牌坊，上面寫着斗大的標語：「全世界最雄偉的小城」，晚上，牌坊頂上滿裝着五彩電燈，火車在幾十公里以外，便可以遠遠看到。</p>
<p>聖城雷諾　好比鑽石耳環</p>
<p>實際上，雷諾城垣並不太小，據去年七月一日的雷諾人口統計：全市約有三萬人，附郊居住約五千人。如果以雷諾為中心的「華曉郡」來算，總數有四萬五千人，較之其他美國的小城市，並不算少。我認為最令人希罕的，是雷諾的人為環境和自然環境，完全配合不起來。打個簡單的營喻，猶如衣不蔽體的丐婦身上，掛着兩顆鑽石的耳環。納伐達全州的貧脊荒凉，無異一個襤褸的丐婦，雷諾和「拉斯伐加斯」，是納伐達州的兩顆金鋼鑽的耳環</p>
<p>我沒有時間上「拉斯伐加斯」去，那兒靠近洛杉磯和世界馳名的「波特」大水閘。聽納伐達的美國朋友們說，拉斯伐加斯跟霄諾一模一樣，它是得了雷諾的眞傳，同樣靠「離婚事業」起家的城市。他們說：「雷諾是老大，拉斯伐加斯是老二」！</p>
<p>一座法院　是離婚製造所</p>
<p>「華曉郡」在雷諾有一座大理石建造的法院，全美國，不，簡直是全世界離婚的製造所。按照美國聯邦制度的憲法，四十八州都有自訂民法刑法的權利。（但需不抵觸憲法），納伐達州的民法離婚結婚部份，訂得特別的從「寬」，在美國習慣中，他們稱為最Weak。納伐達的刑法，除了娼妓和淫戲以外，沒有任何違禁的規定。賭博是公開的，而且是地方政府全力獎勵的。（按：本文作者不久將另文介紹納伐達賭塲）</p>
<p>速辦速決　結婚離婚均簡</p>
<p>在納伐達州結婚，祗須塡一個最簡留的表格，付上兩塊錢的證書費，請一位牧師證婚，問題便完全解決。任何家世的調查，都一槪免除。離婚比結婚稍稍繁複，但較之全美國任何其他一州，或全世界任何其他一國，都不可同日而語。我到雷諾的第二天，拜訪華曉郡法院的公共關係部主任俾末爾先生，他說：納伐達州有正式法律，還是十九世紀末葉間的事，一九〇四年，納伐達的離婚法，規定「速辦速決」的原則，頗取得全美國其他州公民的同情，因為美國雖然是一個婚姻自由的國家，但是，一且夫婦離婚，畢竟是一件受罪的事，加利福尼亞通常辦一件離婚案，從審訊到判決，至少一年，紐約州賓夕法尼亞州，甚至有前後拖累到五年之久的。男女雙方所受的折磨與痛苦，非常慘厲。因此，「自從納伐達規定速辦速決以後，許多人辦離婚案，都專程坐了火車，來到雷諾」。</p>
<p>離婚申請　採六星期制度</p>
<p>因為有這一個環境上的需要，為了容納外省人申請離婚方便起見，州議會在一九一一年，制定了新法律，規定非納伐達州的公民，必須在納伐達居留滿一年，始有申請離婚的權利；到一九一三年，改為『居住滿六個月』；一九三〇年改為『滿三個月』。一九三一年五月開始，改為『居住滿六星期』，從那一年起，離婚的人數陡然增加，一九三一年四月，華曉法院審結的離婚案，祗有一七四件，五月陡增至五百二十四件。從一九三一年五月到現在，一直沿用著所謂『六星期』制度，中間沒有任何改變。</p>
<p>各帶情人　男女兩造默契</p>
<p>大凡到雷諾來辦離婚手續的人，都是美國社會中產以上的階級，這些夫婦在出發以前大半都有了離婚的默契，而且多半各自帶著情人，未來的候補丈夫或候補太太，上雷諾來。六星期的優閒的『居住』，迫使他們携帶大量的金銀，來這兒揮霍，享受。就這樣，使這座沙漠草原上的荒城，滋潤和繁榮起來。大規模的賭塲每星期七天，每天二十四小時通宵開門，雷諾七十二家旅館，沒有一家不燈紅酒綠，天天客滿。『河潰旅館』一天二十塊美金的房租，預先拍了電報，還不能『照辦』。老闆拿著一束電報紙，愁眉苦臉要請我原諒：『這麼多人要預定房間，只有搬進來的人，沒有搬出去的人，呌我怎麼辦？』</p>
<p>離婚婦人　吻大理石柱？投婚戒入河？</p>
<p>河濱旅館左靠雷諾河，右靠郡法院，雷諾人有這樣一個傳說：離了婚的女人，一旦法院判決出來，必定要吻一下法院門首四個大理石的柱子，而且要把結婚鑽戒，摔在河裏。某一張美國電影片中，還拍攝了許多街頭頑童，裸著大腿，在河底摸鑽石戒，我在雷諾公用圖書館裏，看見某本書上，稱道些故事為『無恥的謊言』，它說：雷諾從來沒有這些事，旣然離了婚，還談什麼儀式？</p>
<p>淸晨，我在河岸徘徊得很久，那是一條像浣紗溪一樣的『淸泉碎石』的細流，也許，有多少人在這兒滴過淚水？也有多少人在這兒狂謔歡笑？在法院裏，我聽了兩件離婚案，一件是華盛頓州來的離婚婦人珍妮，的摸有三十五歲光景，還有過兩個孩子，結婚五年了，現在請求離婚。男的沒到庭，請了一位律師代表，女方並沒有鄭重提出離婚的理由，男方律師也沒有表示異議。法官的詢問，集中在六個星期的居留，那一天到的？住在什麼旅館？又搬到什麼旅館？中間有沒有離開納伐達？然後，法官端詳了一下統計表及居留時日的證明文件之類，接著就判決『離婚照准』。</p>
<p>這不是法官的疏忽，法官本身祗不過是執行法律而已，法律對離婚，沒有不准的規定，但必須連續居留六星期，如果中間有一天，申請不離開納伐達，那末，申請就等於廢紙，完全無效。</p>
<p>離婚照准　每件約五分鐘</p>
<p>俾末爾說：法院一共祇有兩位法官，平均審判離婚案的時間，每件的五分鐘。法院並不因為五分鐘而馬虎，法庭上仍然端荘隆重，法官的「法衣」，女書記官的唱名，律師的進退，一點不含糊，為了節省時間，進行得非常緊凑。俾末爾說：這完全是事實的需要，去年（一九四六年）全年雷由諾法院審結的離婚案件，總數達一萬一千一百七十五件。</p>
<p>如果按月份為單位來說：最高紀錄的一月，是一九四五年十二月，達一千一百六十九起，那是日本投降以後，軍官士兵們退伍歸來，亂世男女的離合悲歡，造成了這些慘痛的紀錄。最低的是一九四一年一月，僅一百一十五件，那是珍珠港事變以後，有志男兒踴躍投軍的剎那，「匈奴未滅，何以家為了？」常然就說不上離婚那一套了！</p>
<p>離婚兩小時後結婚立即生效</p>
<p>駭人的數字嗎？我看了俾　爾給我的統計數字。不由得毛骨悚然。但是他笑着說：「還有下交呢，請着看結婚的數字嗎？比離婚多得多呢」！</p>
<p>在雷諾結婚，比任何地方都自山，法律規定：離婚兩小時以後的結婚，立刻生效。許多離婚的男女，短短兩小時之間，從一對變成了兩對。去年一年之中，在霄諾結婚的，有二萬九千一百零四對，相當於離婚數字的兩倍半。當然，這　面，也有不少眞正的「新一郎和「新」娘。一最有趣的，是法院掛號處裏的形形色色，有二十六位「手不停筆」的職員，在那裏整天工作。掛號處的大門口，橫放着櫃台，櫃台上有大幅簿册，兩位和善的老太太，在那兒接受登記，櫃台上放着「納伐達州離婚法摘要，」「納伐達州結婚須知」，許多裝訂得很講究的小册子，贈送給申請人參考。</p>
<p>堂而皇之　牧師也做廣吿</p>
<p>我看見一對不太「新」的新郎和新娘，付了兩塊美金，在請領結婚證書，男的看樣子像退伍陸軍軍官，他們都是舊金山對河的奧克蘭人。那位職員吿訴他們：證書上必須有牧師或法官當證婚人，證婚以後簽字，方能生效。職員還吿訴他們：雷諾祇有兩位法官審理案件，非常忙碌，最好找牧師證婚。她指着櫃台對面的牆上，那兒有三十多個堂皇的牧師的廣告。</p>
<p>牧師有廣吿，我還是第一次看見，他們印得有非常講究的卡片，說明各個人的不同的教會，各個人的不同的屢歷。</p>
<p>收證婚費　捐給敎會裏面</p>
<p>那天下午，我訪問了美以美會的　尊牧師，他的辦公室破璃門上，有金字寫的，像貿易公司一樣的「招牌」，裏而坐着好幾排等候他證婚上的男女華尊牧師在百忙由接見我，和我談了許多男女結婚的宗教的道理，他說：「全世界的人，都以為霄諾是一座單惡之城，但很少有人明瞭：當諾結婚的人數，每年都比離婚的多」。</p>
<p>我提出兩個問題問華尊牧師：第一，每次替他們證婚，收費若干？第二，那些離婚兩小時便來結婚的人，你對他們有什麼教誨和安慰？華尊牧師非常不樂意，彷彿嫌我問得太赤裸裸。但是，收師都是有良好修養的，他說：許多其他教會，收很高的證婚費，這是不應該的，美以美會不收費，由他們自由樂捐，每次由五元至二十元不等，捐款一律給教會之用。第二，剛離婚馬上來結婚的人固然有，但畢竟很少，他所證的婚，大部份都是眞正的新郎和新娘。</p>
<p>華尊牧師說；他替一對華僑男女證過婚，但他們不是教徒。他說：『我證婚的唯一要求，是勸他們相信基督教」。</p>
<p>華僑男女在雷諾的很少，在雷諾離婚的更少，但是也有，那不是眞正的像西洋人的離婚，而是為了其它（？）的理由。</p>
<p>一位姓關的老僑領，介紹我採訪一位名叫約翰，戴維遜的大律師，在一座巍峨的高樓上，陳設非常講究，戴維遜律師在雷諾十七年，一手辦了幾千件離婚官司，美國四十八州公民，他都替他們辦過案子，中國華僑的，也辦了苦干。英國的，澳洲的，加拿大的？他都辦過，他翻理着一件加拿大的離婚檔案，說『這是一件相當傷腦筋的案子』！</p>
<p>片面離婚　手續不算完成</p>
<p>好奇心促使我問他許多法理上的難題，譬如。我說；「我有一位朋友在紐約，夫婦感情不睦，丈夫要到納伐達來離婚，但是太太是相當守舊的人，寗死不接受離婚條件，試問，那位先生有什麼辦法？假使丈夫來這兒，單方面離婚，能不能生效？」</p>
<p>戴維遜律師聽了很新奇，他說：「這是你們中國人的情形，美國人不會這樣，丈夫不愛她，夫婦不能共同生活，何必一定要守著夫婦的名義」？接着他又稅：納伐達的離婚法，要經過各州分別認可，纔能在各州分別生效。紐約州是最痛恨納伐達的離婚　的。丈夫在這裏獲得了片面核准的離婚，如果他回到紐約另娶，原　可向紐約法院控吿。如果不回紐約州居住，他的片面離婚；仍然有法理根基。不過無論如何，納伐達的法院，要將這件公案，移轉到紐約去，一定要住在紐約的原妻簽字認可以後，才算眞正完成法律手續。</p>
<p>律師說：在美國，沒有寗死不離婚的事，夫婦關係的成立，靠兩造的感情結合，旣然一方而毫無感情可言，另一方面至多要求一點物質上的補償。所以，他認為；納伐達的法律，不但很合情理，也合人類的天性。他說：許多英國人，加拿大人，到雷諾來辦離婚，最初配偶對方，都相當的不願意。但是，旣然配偶的一方，有決心到電諾來了，對方也就祗有談判要求補償的一途了。</p>
<p>他還說：「如果你假定的，那位紐約的朋友，來雷諾辦片面離婚手續，辦妥以後，如果他就長期居住在納伐達州。那末，縱然對方不同意，也就無可如何」。</p>
<p>據戴維遜律師的經騐：美國的離婚官司，很少有像中國那樣巨額的瞻養費，除非是男的自動給與，法院判給贍養費的很少，縱然有，那是極微少的。</p>
<p>他說，納伐達州的法律，雖然替離婚開一道方便之門，但是法律非常注意保護嬰孩，因為，「嬰孩是民旅的幼苗，我們不能摧傷他」。他還說：離了婚的父母，如果母親不同意，父親不得强奪嬰孩，離婚的父親，對嬰孩教養，應負全責，「所謂贍養費，大半都是瞻養嬰孩的，並非瞻養棄婦」。戴維逊律師說得頭頭是道，越說越起勁！「棄婦有生存能力，牠可以再結婚，再當新娘，何必瞻養？」</p>
<p>一個東方人來觀察西洋社會是不容易的。我頓然間想起吳芳吉的「婉容詞」，想起「一步一回頭」的棄婦吟，眞有說不盡的滄桑之感！</p>

<h3>環視基隆漁港</h3>
<p>— 八日基隆航訊　本報駐台記者楊育</p>
<p>四面環水的台灣島，海岸綫延長達三九八里，附近的大小島嶼，有七十七個之多，沿岸屈曲，船舶進出非常不便，許多河川不是水流湍急就是易於泛濫，再加夏季的低氣壓和冬季的季節風的影響，所以台島的漁業一向受制於這些自然條件，而無法發達。及至日本人佔有了這裏以後，乃置重點於這項工作，於大正七年（民國七年）設置了水產課，隸於台灣總督府之下，開始以基隆為中心，從事於帆船捕魚，這也可以說是台灣有計劃捕魚的嚆矢，至昭和九年（民國二十三年）五月間，更以八十三萬日元的工程費，將基隆　築了一個優秀的漁港，水面廣闊，深約五米，可以容納四百艘左右的漁船。在陸地上也興建了水產館，漁　塲，珊瑚市塲，漁業無綫電台，倉庫，住宅，冷凍工廠，製冰工塲，水產講習所等等勢凡漁港的必要設備，一應俱全，雖然高雄，蘇澳，花運港，新港，馬公等地也有漁港建築，但是總不及基隆這樣完善。</p>
<p>日本人對台省的水產貿易非常重視，他們自己承認中國國內的政治局勢和經濟狀况，是水產貿易的睛雨計，為了要爭取市塲，不得不集中所有的力量，因此過去本省的水產事業，本省人除掉做一些下手外，其他部門是完全被摒諸門外的，談起水產，現下最嚴重的還是人才問題，日本人已經全部遣回，要想立刻補充人員先來作一個勉强的維持多幾乎不可能。</p>
<p>水產學校　作育二百名幹部</p>
<p>基隆漁港永遠躱在濛濛細雨中。第一次欣賞到它的眞姿，給我的印象却是殘破與憔悴。在人力車上望不盡的屋宇遺骸東倒西歪的到處堆着，近四十次的大轟炸，給它的伸出傷太重了。</p>
<p>濱町的水產館，過去是日本人經營基隆漁港發號施令的大本營，然而現在緊閉着大門，毫無生氣地悄悄蹲在海邊，我從門縫裏望進去，灰塵滿積，黑黝黝的像個桔廂一般，聽說這裏是由海軍接收的，可是事實上現在並沒有加以利用。再往北去，高高低低的走了不少山路才看到水產職業學校從一塊「皇路淸夷」的石碑後面露了出來。</p>
<p>這所省立水產職業學校的前身，是台灣總督府的水產講習所，在民國三十二年間成立，校舍旣未曾全部建竣，而新蓋的工塲又被炸彈摧毁，以致水產學校在前年十二月間接收下，只拿到了兩幢樓房，三幢平房。過去講習所是中等學校的編制，但僅有初中部，光復後已添設了一班高中，二百多個學生分配在這一點房子裏，實在太嫌狹窄了。高中一年級現在分為養殖·製造和漁撈三個班，初中雖遵照教育當局的指示沒有分開，但除去普通學科外，也先授以水產事業的基本常識，在這三個班中，最重視渔撈，其次是製造，養殖班在目前只有四個學生選讀。重要的課程有游泳操艇，漁具學，製造法，養殖法，水產食品，氣象學，駕駛，漁物處理，漁撈槪論，漁具製造，水產生物等項，一星期平均上課在四十小時左右，相當吃重，然而赤了足的學生，風雨無間的每天從各處利用着火車與公共汽車跋涉到這裏來，這種刻苦耐勞的學習精神，很値得稱道。</p>
<p>因為待遇較差，所以不容易聘到敎師，同時國內關於水產事業的書籍太少，這裏祗能自編教村印發講義，可是限於經費又無法多印，台省教育界最普遍的人與書的恐慌情形，在這裏顯示得更加明白了。</p>
<p>供給漁撈科學生實習用的捕魚船，現在祗有一隻一四〇噸鎭壳的「台鯨號」，手操網，拖編等漁具，雖有但並不多。製浩科的工塲，現正在修理，大約還需十餘天就可以開工，這裏也預備自己加工製造魚類食物和罐頭，學校當局計劃在本年度擴充校舍，改造禮堂，添造實習用船與漁具等，預算達二千餘萬台幣，究竟能得到多少現在雖還不知道，但是任何人多希望這所學校能在合灣的水產事業上佔一個重要地位的。</p>
<p>報載最近當局準備在國內籌設一所國立水產職業學校，在台省除去這裹的一個水產學校外，尚有高雄分校以及澎湖水校各一所，希望今後能互相聯繫起來，共為我國的水產專業做一番發揚光大的工作。</p>
<p>臭冷工塲　每天製冰四十五噸</p>
<p>在日本很有地位的南日本漁業公司基隆濱町分公司的原址，現在已經樹上了「台灣水產有限公司基隆分公司」的招牌，運個公司過去很具規模，擁有漁船二百艘，建有冷凍工廠，加工廠，可是到了戰爭末期一方面受到轟炸，一方面又因日本人佔據了香港，菲列賓和海南島等地以後，把重心移至高雄，所以也萎靡過一陣，但是現在又回復了以前的情形，馬達聲又開始響起在這靜謐的海邊了。</p>
<p>加工廠因為毁損過重，已無法應用，現在已改為辦公處所了，目下公司的主要業務是漁撈和製冰。原有二百條漁船有的在戰時黴為軍用，有的被炸沉，接收以後經過整理，約有二三十艘可以應用，現在已經分批出海捕魚了。普通一對漁船，每月平均出海兩次，約可摘獲四千箱的魚類（每箱三十六斤），其中以分布於中國東海和台灣海峽的海鯽魚，鯛魚為最多，運回以後便發賣給各處的魚市塲，因為需要殷切，所以公司方面時常感到捕來的魚，數量上不够分配，這是有待於將來漁船增多方能大量供應的。</p>
<p>冷凍工廠劉廠長領導記者在廠裏參觀了一下。冷凍工廠原有冷藏，加工與製冰三部份。冷藏庫現在仍維原狀，共計有十五間，溫度大都在零下四度，冷藏魚可以維持一星期至十天加工部份前面說過已經改為辦公所而停頓了，製冰工塲在日本時代每天能生產一三五噸，但接收後因機器需加修理，而製冰原料阿摩尼亞又缺貨以致停頓到去年十月間才開工，現在公司方面已成立了用琉胺製造阿摩尼亞的工廠，同時也購進許多美國貨阿摩尼亞，可是因為漁船太少，需用量大見减低，現在每天能製造四十五噸的水，除掉供應漁船，銷售民間外，還有剩餘。</p>
<p>一架四百匹馬力的壓縮機上，結滿了厚厚的冰塊，阿摩尼亞經過不斷的壓縮以後，通過了無數管子，輸送到每一個需要的部份，這裏到處都能嗅着一股觸鼻的臭氣。我們又低頭鑽進了冷得令人打噤的製水間，一排排的空筒被起重機吊起到水管下面，裝滿了濾過的海水，再放入一個個鹽鈣水的深坑裏，通有阿摩尼亞的無數管子，開始吸取它的熱量，普通只要二十四小時就可以結成了堅厚的水塊。</p>
<p>社寮島上　訪水產試驗所</p>
<p>從濱雇了艘小划子，渡過了漁港　綠的海水，到達北岸的社寮島水產試騐所門前，幾根稀疏的熱幣棕櫚，在斜風細雨　凄冷地飄搖不定。該所李所長到台北去公幹，由總務科曾科長榜待了記者，很詳細地吿訴我關於這個試騐所過去的歷史。</p>
<p>這襄原來是台灣總督府的水產試騐所，日本人過去一面注重生產，一面也着重研究，所以台灣的許多工碮農林等產業部份能够被處理得有條不紊，這實在是個大原因，水產試騐當初分成漁撈，海洋，加工，養殖四個部門。「漁撈」除掉從事於技術上的捕魚外，主要工作是在探尋漁塲，調查魚類，然後通知各漁業公司依據了他們的綫索去捕取。「海洋」方面則專重潮流，水溫，海底地質等的考與測量，「加工」是把水產物拿來研究品質，改良製造。過去水產試騐所造有許多漁船，內中一艘照南丸，載重四一八噸，設備完善，可以說是東亞唯一的一艘漁撈船，上面可以同時進行漁撈，海洋和加三種工作，現在已由道裏在高雄接收了下來，正加緊修理中，水產試驗所對它的期得很高，相信不久將來，它將為合灣的水產事業發揮優秀的功能。</p>
<p>水產試騐所的房屋，在戰爭中被摧毁得只賸下一　短牆，前年十二月廿一日接收以後，直到去年五月間才算把辦公所和工塲草草修竣，一面整理在火堆裏檢出的書籍和過去的報吿，一面搜尋疏散在四處的器械，至九月間才勉强開始辦公，仍舊照以前的方針，繼續幹下去，預計今年下半年在漁撈方面可能因漁船的補充完成而貢獻一點力量。海洋勘測方面因為器械的殘缺，恐無法達到預期的目的，規在僅能用一些日本人留下的測定潮流·水溫·水的比重的簡單儀器，每天在漁港內的八尺門附近測量一次，加工方面目前只能小規模的製造洋菜，但本年內是預備製造罐頭和其他魚類食品。</p>
<p>魚類在浪潮中產卵可能受精的機會據總計只有百分之四，最近這裏曾派了技師會同農林處人員在台北公館實騐人工孵化，結果百分之九十九以上的魚卵多能孵出小魚來，得到了養殖試騐的圓滿結果。同時這裏還研究以前日本人沒有完成的一項工作，就是罐頭中所加進去的加布力酸防腐劑，怎樣才能使它加得少而仍能持久不變質且對人體健康沒有影響，因為普通的防腐劑對於人體多會發生妨害作用的。</p>
<p>水產試騐所在花　港有一分所，專重養殖，過去很有成績，但是去年的颱風把堤防吹壞，損失很大，現正在趧修中。高雄也擬籌設一個分所，來從事研究魚皮　革的工業。</p>
<p>在苦難中成長着的基隆漁港中的三個機構，一切多在簡陋中求維持，可是單是維持是不够的，今後怎樣發展，怎樣擴充，是値得注目的一件事，尤其在水產事業一向落後的中國，似乎正應該來這個時機，利用旣有的基礎再乘建樹一點成績，不能短視，也更不能因循了。</p>
<h3>迅定大西南　張羣京川來去</h3>
<p>— 重慶二日航訊　蕭金</p>
<p>値得注視的三週間動態</p>
<p>自從張羣氏赴美就醫，川省主席由鄧鍚侯氏代理，四川的省政便因為整個中國的政治局勢而動蕩着，尤其是張羣氏，自美返國，適在政府改組進行期中，從南京傳來張羣氏有出任行政院長可能的消息，一般人更認為報紙上透露着的西南大局將有所變動的推測，是可能，而可靠的了。</p>
<p>自京返川　發表此行任務</p>
<p>張羣氏二月一日自京返川，在重慶九龍坡機塲有片刻停留，繼即去成都。在這短短時間裏，他曾發表回川的任務，他表示關於重慶行轅的職務，一時尚未有卸責的考慮，而對於四川省主席一職，則再三的　讓精力關係，不能再兼。</p>
<p>這之間，記者曾提到混亂經年的西康事件，張氏懇切的說，這是回川的主要任務之一，康變如何處理，尚得去成都經過全盤的研討以後，才能有所決定。</p>
<p>而在張主席去成都後，重慶報紙一般的推測和透露，不外鄧錫侯的正式任命四川省主席，劉文輝的撤換，重慶市市長將調任西康省主席，省府秘書長李伯申調長重慶市。</p>
<p>護鄕運動　向張羣氏請願</p>
<p>緊接着張羣氏的返川，二月二日西康旅渝人士成立護鄉遝動委員會，列舉西康政冶腐敗，烟土遍地，軍紀蕩然等罪名，提出「撤換劉文輝，停止康地軍事行動，撫輯流亡」等項要求，對於西康省政府的改組，向張羣氏請願</p>
<p>張氏去成都後，從一日到五日，均未到省府辦公，祗在私邸接見賓客，五日曾宴鄧錫侯，劉文輝，蕭毅肅，向傳義，席間並曾討論川康現局，而四日鄧錫侯亦曾邀宴張氏及上述人物，也是以川康現局為談話主題。</p>
<p>接連，四川省參議會向張兼主席提出要求，盼望省政能有專人負責。</p>
<p>平靜的過了幾天。</p>
<p>二月十日，川康綏靖會議在成都召開。</p>
<p>綏靖會議　諸事提出討論</p>
<p>十日的重慶「大公報」有一條値得重視的成都專電：</p>
<p>「張羣定週內離蓉赴渝，關於川康軍政人事問題，須待呈報　蔣主席後，始能決定。張氏在蓉招待川康各界首長及社會賢達，席上談稱：余自十五年後，始終追隨　蔣主席，對川事處理多會參加意見。二十七年任行轅主任（西南）與鄧錫俟，劉文輝，潘文華等，各軍事首長在重慶南岸在山王陵基公館共商政事，表明個人對川事態度。二十九年兼理川政，迄今六年，深得各方贊助，達川人對抗戰建國之大責。今後本人恐將隨時奉召出川，川事當偏勞鄧代主席多為負責，川康原屬一家，竭望不分彼此，精誠合作，本人縱不兼理川政，以主持西南行轅關係，亦當對川康事盡力云。……」</p>
<p>從這專電裏，川康軍事政治人事的變動，已經明顯地透露出來，而張主席碍於地方勢力的曖昩態度，亦甚明顯。</p>
<p>川康綏靖會議參加者，除鄧劉而外，尙有行轅蕭參謀長毅肅，及川康將領二十餘人，會議至十一日完畢，會中蕭參謀長，川康綏署劉參謀長萬里，二十四軍參謀長伍培英，均曾報吿業務，對今後治安，烟匪，西南各省聯防，均曾有所討論及決定。</p>
<p>之前，張氏曾派重慶行轅副參謀長董健儿在雅安一帶視察。</p>
<p>十二日，張羣氏返渝的消息傳來。</p>
<p>十四日，張氏仍不見來，成都傳來的消息說，張氏在候蔣主席派赴的「追雲號」專機，因此改定十五日來重慶。終於在十六日午後，「追雲號」專機由成都把張氏載返重慶。</p>
<p>十七日午後四時，張氏出席張市長篤倫及胡參議長子勗，在勝利大廈的歡迎大會，對於川康問題，作如下報吿，川省府暫不改組，但本人按行政官三年一任論，已滿兩任，故今後擬負行轅專責，並云川康綏靖公署鄧主任兼代主席錫侯在川服務歷史甚久，信譽尤佳，必能得到川民之愛戴</p>
<p>處理康變　分別良莠勦撫</p>
<p>有關西康部份，他說普經多方考察，剷烟是一個主因，而利川機會肇事之李元亨等，均爲多年慣匪，解決方案業於川康綏靖會議決定，分別良莠，予以剿撫，且謂劉文輝主席在康多年，此次不幸事件，曾受相當刺激，己發覺政治上應有所興革，將召集康政檢討會議，以謀革新。</p>
<p>張氏於二十二日晨九時半飛京，胡子昂同行，當晚謁蔣主席報吿川康近情。</p>
<p>綜計張氏由京返川共三十一日，十五天留在成都，五天勾留重慶，川政問題，康變問題，均曾計及。康變問題，已經有「分別良莠予以剿撫」的決定，而對於西南人事問題，尚未有具體的表示。由於張羣氏去京後的動向，似乎川康問題已經變得較為次要，但一般人都盼望着火西南的安定，在遍地炸烟的中國，西南是較為安靜的，但政局不安定，人心受影響，這一點，如張羣氏眞出任行政院，也不能忽略，拖總不是辦法。</p>

<h3>懷憶一位漂泊的作家　詹姆士·班奈脫</h3>
<p>— 影茗</p>
<p>北平東城的酒樓聚仙居，自那蒼古黯淡的門面看，便可斷定它是一個有悠久歷史的紀念物。傳說明淸以來，許多京華的詩人逸士，時常將它當作一處聚會的所在，猶之上海的福祿壽與新雅，幾乎是為招致文士與作家而著聞的。</p>
<p>一九三二年秋間，住在南池子的朝鮮籍醫生金桐谷，因為我是他一個常用的顧客，——診治心神衰弱——在一天傍晚，邀的我到聚仙居去小佽，說有幾個和你同道的，藉機會見一見面。然而不是中國人。因為到他那裏來求診的，多半是住在東城的歐美僑民。</p>
<p>比晚，我自西單乘電車到東城，再乘人力車到聚仙居的時候，桐谷醫士預先定的那間雅座，已燈光輝燦，高朋滿座了。他見我進來，起身來招呼，在座的人們，因他的介紹。和我握手。其間有兩個西籍：一個很高岸瘦削；一個中身材，紅紅的面龐，粗率樣子，據桐谷醫士說，他是頂頂大名的小說家，美國班奈脫先生。當時我很訝異：班奈脫先生是英國人，已經六十餘歲了，那裏是此等年少英武的樣子。難道另有一　理奈脫麼？</p>
<p>一根捲烟之後，我們入席，其間兩個粵籍的華僑便提到許多近來科學上的新問題；還有一位年靑的西服紳士，據稱是副司令的親信秘書，接着談起幾種海生物界的新發現。我見班奈脫先生坐在一隅，用一種很不純熟的姿態拿着箸子取蝦仁。我對他說：我們並不拘於用筷子的習俗，用調羹還好些。他笑了一笑，說我就不講禮貌了。用了兩羹蝦仁之後，他舉起杯來，向我和桐谷醫士勸酒，桐谷醫士便說作家與酒有不可解的關係的，又問他中國的紹興較之美國啤酒怎樣。班奈脫先生說，這些年間，夏秋間喝啤酒不很時髦了，許多人都用慣了「威士忌蘇打」。</p>
<p>我很不相信這位班奈脫先生就是那位安諾德班奈脫先生。我問他近來寫作了些什麼。他很高興，却又做出一種愁眉不展的樣子，說在東方住慣了，覺得和一般生活非常隔膜，不易得到材料；目前很希望到南洋旅行去，因為大氣在出秋後凉了起來，正是作赤道各地旅行的時候。散了席，我向他問及美國幾位作家——德萊賽，奧尼爾，費茲幾那德（Fitzgerald）的近况。他說他和德萊賽不熟，奧尼爾很受人推崇，費茲却是一個理想主義者，—無所謂。…他又吿訴我在中國許多觀感，話中有許多評論使我難解。然而他却抱有和我同一的主張，說藝術家適宜於住北平，因為北平的氣候與生活都不顯嚴緊。</p>
<p>散了宴，都忽忽分了手。</p>
<p>兩個多月，北平的霜風括了起來。我為着赴××國光社經理某君的婚宴，想起應購備的禮物，順便到東單牌樓的花店去買一隻鮮花籃。剛落下人力車，我忽瞥見花店的比鄰——一爿西服呢絨店，門口站着兩個西籍人，那高岸瘦削的，是在桐谷醫士的宴間見過的。我向他打招呼，並問及班奈脫先生。他說班奈脫光生早走了；因為他的行踪時常不定。</p>
<p>廿三年，我居在杭州，時常到葡萄巷（後改名大學路）的圖書館去看報。有一次，我翻了幾本美國雜誌，發現了詹姆士，班奈脫這名字。明年，我到上海，無意同和友人C君談及他。C君說，這位奈脫先生在上海還著聞，不但會在聖的翰任過教授，而且在商務出版過一册呌「梅花與靑的香霧」（Plum　Blossom　and　Blue　Incense）的小說集，他自己所寫的那幾篇，對中國朋友的態度很誠懇。C君又說：班奈脫是一個改革主義者，並不諂諛中國人，他對中國的舊習慣，抱不滿態度，雖然也少不了帶些柴霍甫式的諷刺，然而骨子裏的意識是正確的。</p>
<p>二十七年回湘，適巧弟任余的書筍中有「梅花與靑的香霧」一書，便拿來選讀了幾篇。我覺得共中最好的三篇——一是「一個期待著的婦人」（The　woman　who　waited），一是「歌跳家」（Singing　Skipper）「中斷的旅行」（Wing's　Interrupted　Journey）</p>
<p>「一個期待着的婦人」描寫在一條赴澳洲的船上，前往西德尼（Sydney）任領事館副領事職的克蘭大爾（Crandall）怎樣，和他的同伴——一位殖民地武官，與到澳洲去結婚的稅務員埃利（Ellery）怎樣熟識的情形，他用心理學的手法，描寫這埃利的特殊性型，十分活潑生動；他嘴裏離不了他的未婚妻和「蘇打威士忌。」「歌跳家」描寫一個自舊金山前來東方某埠與他的未婚妻阿黃結婚的靑年歌跳家史丹尼（Stanley　Mac　Tavish），在船上，因挪威人喜克七比（Hicksby）椰榆他是一個歌跳家，兩人在甲版上決鬥起來；船上多人都為喜克士比抱不平，喜克士此也因鬥敗準備向他施以可怕的報復。史丹尼知事不妙，便在船抵港之前預先乘划上岸了。他到他的叔父家裏，幾天後，就和阿黃商議結婚。阿黃雖同意了，心裏却隱藏着一層意外的痛苦。她呌史丹尼在結婚之夜購備兩支臘燭。婚夜，她就那麼臨燭　神位行了三個禮。史丹尼感覺這種派頭很不好，一通夜竟未入睡，果然，第二天，他和阿黃出門，便即受了狙　，阿黃受傷。「中斷的旅行」，描寫提琴家羅德利克（Joseph　Roderick），他的同伴蘇加（Sascha）和伊凡（Ivan），在夏天一次表演塲中，因受了時疫感冒，逝世了。他在重病之中，怎樣得了同居的文子林的扶助，治好了病，成了莫逆。他們作了一段旅行。從這上面，可以看出中美兩國間人的個性是如何溶洽。</p>
<p>總之，詹姆士，班奈脫先生的作風，雖然少不了受了二十世紀寫實主義的影響，但體裁却獨立，沒有什麼做作的痕跡。他的態度直率，而且不舖什麼故事。看他的小說，便可以看到歐美民衆在東方所過的一般生活與生活態度。現在我們因為聯合國的關係，親密的態度當然更進一層。然而，友好不在僅拘形式，班奈脫先生對我們的生活剖析與批評，我們認為也是一個誠懇的表現呢。</p>
<h3>蘆荻漁歌</h3>
<p>— 胡亞光</p>
<h3>譯歐洲藝術史綱序</h3>
<p>— 田禽</p>
<p>這部將近二十萬字的譯稿正在出版界不景氣的當兒脫稿了！我眞祖心是否能變成鉛字。因為在物價飛漲，民不聊生的今日，有誰能不願血本的出版這種「冷門貨」，又有誰肯平心靜氣的閱讀這種極度專門的桔燥文章？</p>
<p>最初，在我開始翻譯的時候，不是沒有人勸說過我，「趁早不要譯這些東西，你攪半了輩子理論玩藝兒還沒有够啊？……」</p>
<p>朋友的勸吿也算是好意的，因為他深深的知道理論的東西；銷路確成問題，因此也就影響到它的出路——出版問題。他知道我是一個靠筆吃飯的窮書獃子，看在生活上，似乎應該搞些近於「色情」的東西多騙幾個錢來維持生活。然而，這位朋友的好意，我却沒有接受，固執地把它譯了出來。雖說它旣「當」不了黃金，又「當」不了美鈔，可是，當我在戲劇節的前夕全部脫稿的時候，看看那將三寸厚；摺疊在一起的譯稿，我眞有說不出的喜悅！老妻在一旁為我一章一章的的抄寫着，她也在分享我的喜悅，並且稚氣的為我道賀！</p>
<p>原書名為“An　Outline　History　of　Art”，作者係芝加哥大學藝術講座的名教授Joseph　Pjoan，著有藝術史綱三册，第一册敘及埃及，近東，希臘，羅馬，的藝術史，第二册叙及歐洲中世紀，以色列，遠東，美洲土人的藝術史，第三册即是拙譯，自文藝復興敘述到近代藝術，每册都可獨立，內容甚為豐富，以拙譯而論，其原書中即有將近三百幅之名畫，彫刻，建築……的插圖，這在國內的一般藝術史的著作裏是不易看得到的。</p>
<p>摯友王寵杰兄於抗戰期中赴美學習海軍，他知道我平生最歡喜閱讀關於藝術方面的著作，雖身在國外，猶念念不忘故人。特意從美亞美寄給我這本書。由於彼時大戰方酣，郵路梗塞，輾轉經年，始於去歲六月間到達重慶，當時，我正在病中（平生最厲害的一次病），足了一月才恢復健康。</p>
<p>由於經濟奇窘，內人在我身體剛剛復原的時候，不得不尋求工作，因而參加了靑年電去做女兵（現已退伍）。得時，承老友劉晴波兄借給我一間幽雅的房間，飲食起居均稱方便，生活比較安定舒適，怡巧我服務的機關（一個老百姓團體）因為復員的關係也停止辦公，於是我便終日從事譯述工作，進行起來倒也順利，全書十六章，譯者於十一月廿五日離重慶時，已譯完十二章，在譯述的過程中，最費時間的倒不是譯文，而是考據工作，比如某一畫家的年代及出生地帶等，為了使讀者一目了然起見，我曾不憚厭煩的幾乎花去與譯書一樣多的時間去查考。在這方面平心而論我是對得起親愛的讀者們的。老實說，我是一個戲劇與文學的學徒，胃然譯述這樣大部頭的隔行著作，也許會有錯誤的地方，但，我誠懇的希望讀者指正，絕對樂於接受公正的批評，期有所改正。</p>
<p>我到南京以後（十二月二日），本來計劃在一個月內把剩餘的四章全部譯出，料不到，「住」的問題煩擾着我，於是僕僕京，滬，京蘇道上，往返數次，幸蒙文化界老友李冰爐兄，毅然拒絕以「條子」頂他的房間的老爺們，而分給我一間白住，這在道德淪沉的今日，的確是不可多得的道義朋友。</p>
<p>房子問題雖然解決了。然而問題又來了！我的工作地點在南京，內人住在上海，假如分居兩地，把我每月的全部收入—三十萬元，分作兩半來用，結果兩個人都活不了。為了這，我斷然的辭掉工作，茫然的跑到上海來。</p>
<p>心想從此可以實現我多年的理想—職業的寫作生活，那知道，近半月來由於黃金作祟，物價像野馬似的奔騰，瞻望前途，不寒而慄！</p>
<p>勝利後，老母屢次催余早作歸計，藉資全家團聚。誰想到大局越來越壞，我們身為勝利的國民，竟連通信的權利都沒有了！回家當然更談不到了！</p>
<p>最近胞弟冒險來津，云及家產蕩然，生活頗成問題，希望我能不時接濟。且老母終日倚閭南望，老淚盈眶，古稀白髪，思子之心日切。此情此景，能不令遊子痛心疾首！</p>
<p>譯者流亡十載，所幸未辱家風，老母聞之，常可破涕為笑。何日北歸？當以戰神的顏面是瞻，今當全書校閱完畢之日，　以此書敬獻於慈祥的老母膝前，永留紀念。</p>
<p>最後幷向不顧血本而為拙譯出版的出版家致敬！</p>
<p>（三六，二，一九。上海奇寒之日）</p>
<h3>「家旗」</h3>
<p>— 陳因譯</p>
<p>某星期日約翰太太把她小孩的幾張尿布洗了晒到後廊上，用針釘起來讓它們在風中吹着。過了一會她和約翰先生從禮拜堂回來的時候看見那些東西在廊子上飄楊着。</p>
<p>約翰先生站住了間：「瑪麗，那廊子上是什麼東西？」</p>
<p>「親愛的，」瑪麗回答說，「那是我們聯邦的旗子。」</p>
<p>「好的，」約翰先生說「讓它們永久飄揚吧」。</p>
<h3>記起了蘇曼殊</h3>
<p>— 魯莽</p>
<p>杭州的朋友來信，幾次提到女俠秋瑾，烈士徐錫麟的墳墓如何如何。有人且感慨系之的說：白堤上馮小靑的埋骨處，煥然一新，　聯歷歷可誦，而孤山詩葬無人聞問者己多年了。其實强顏為歡的時代，本來就是注重表面的文飾，原不足為怪。</p>
<p>孤山諸葬，除了蘇曼殊一穴，和我都有此關係，然而因為性情相近，却特別懷念蘇墓。當此　　綠意，水發春情，料悄東風中，逝去快到半世紀的開國詩人，在地下不知作何幻想？</p>
<p>「開國詩人」的諡號，贈給曼殊大師最好沒有，而開國詩人之忽而還入空門，今天看來，才恍然不悟。</p>
<p>曼殊因為參加革命，與黨人亡命東瀛，辛亥後又與黨人回國，別人全熱烈地跑上了政治舞台，唯有他落落寡合，縱然白天和朋友們談笑風生，到了酒闌人散，夜靜更深，便一切都超脫了。他不但沒有趕政治的熱關，後來且入山唯恐不深。他是以「亦在亦俠亦溢文」著名，加人革命是他的「俠」，辛亥成功回國以後，他的態度陷於「在」，為什麼「在」？必有難言之隱，詩人不像政論家，對國事是不肯直言的。詩人原屬「溫文」，像秦少游，杜收之，溫飛卿都是他以愛國之情轉爲情人之情，曼殊便成了「情聖」，「還君一鉢無情淚，恨不相逢未髴時」，當他遁入空門以後，還假托這些艷情，表示未能忘　國事，所以說曼殊是個熟情人，也是個眞愛國的男兒，他常以但丁，拜倫自比，其愛國可想而知，但是他早已看出國步的艱難，未來的厄運，所以終於狂憂而死，只是他沒有表現民初新劇中言論老生激勗慷慨的神情，也沒有像屈原那樣的耿直，繫石投江，造成轟動一時的大新聞。</p>
<p>倘使說曼殊是純粹的浪漫主義者，他何必加入革命黨，倘使說曼殊無意國事，他又何必投奔祖國？何必淸狂若是？曼殊是熱腸人，又是智慧者，常初加入「革命黨」，由於熱腸；回國後淸在如是，由於觀察後的失望。一些不能剖晰但丁，拜倫的心理的人們，是同樣的不能剖晰曼殊的。</p>
<p>終究是開國詩人，他的作品那們奔放暢達！然而又為了失望，有許多是哀宛動人的。張默君先生詩句：「自有淸剛在詩骨，欲扶正雅起騷魂」，到了正雅難扶，騷魂不起，詩人們自然往往流入靡受愁苦。我們綜觀曼殊的作品，有的是開國之聲，有的靡曼愁苦，便非「福音」，在他或許基於　根，或許率直流露，但是三十幾年以後看起來，他在民國開鑼之日，便感不適，眞非偶然了。論開國以來的「文化人」，受殊自然是第一個，他的智慧，性情，表現，言行，處處是「文化人」，然而中國蛻變期中的特徵，正也是這一種文化人的特徵。時間說是過得很久，但以曼殊時代比之現在，像是毫無距雖，陽光一現以後，忽然烏雲四合，曼殊有知，也要奇怪歷史在重演了。</p>
<p>歷史在重演了，可惜今天連蘇曼殊這樣的詩人也不看見了，眞是一代不如一代嗎！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　194</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我想這突如其來的「保護」，確屬有些古怪。我們一到大廳，一看那種情景，確實有些呌人生氣：那领頭的果眞是一位女子，穿着北平時新的短旗衫，模樣很標緻風流，有些像鶴見口裏形容過的萍子小姐。她正在那裏，像煞那麼一回事，盤間着本樓的經理。她的身後，站着兩個全身披掛的日本衛隊。這兩個傢伙生得眞有那們「阿　」，我認為很像一對糞蛆；從頭到脚，都是圓滾滾地，圓得兩隻手臂撒開在兩邊，貼不攏身，各人手上提着一隻二十響的新式德國手槍。</p>
<p>大廳以內，都成了他們的警戒區了，從門內一直到門外，排着隊子，也都全付武裝。大街口以及對街，似乎殺氣騰騰，可惜街上路燈昏矇，距離較遠，我這一雙近視眼睛簡直看不淸楚。</p>
<p>「嘿，氣派不小，又是快槍對子，又是機關槍！」小老虎輕輕吿訴耀羣。這一說明，正好把我瞧不淸楚的對街情景，描畫出來了。</p>
<p>「對不起！」鶴見壓住一股怒氣，滿臉生疼的踅了過去，參加那個女首領和總經理的問答塲面。他操着一口北平調腔，帶着些混混意味，橫身上下，連走路的樣子在內，充滿了北平所謂「一股膘勁」。他其所以用北平話，因為對方也是滿口的「京腔」。</p>
<p>對方女首領。正像煞一回事，在考問那位裝着滿身土氣的總經理，經鶴見這麼橫插一枝，突如其來的打岔，當然有些奇怪，為了維持現狀下的「尊嚴」，先是柳眉一豎，其次是鳳目圖睜；十分驕悍地：</p>
<p>「嗯……？」這一「嗯」，表示「你是那裏殺出來的程咬金？」</p>
<p>「嗯……！」鶴見在氣頭上，把紳士派的禮貌丟掉了，逼起了所有的丹田底氣，這麼照樣「嗯」了一下，膛音很厚，把這所軒敞的大廳，震得四壁起了回聲嗡嗡不絕。鶴見這一點行動，透着有些無賴的氣息，知是為了要答覆那女子的一「嗯」：好像是說，「你且睜開了狗眼，把老爺認認淸楚」。</p>
<p>「你是什麼人？」她發了雌威了。</p>
<p>「我嗎？……暫且管不着，反正你早知道了—多此一問，不是嗎？—可是我得請教一句，貴機關怎麼稱呼，到這裏來有什麼任務？」鶴見說着話，一面拿出了烟捲，索性無賴到底了。</p>
<p>這個塲面把我攪得有些糊塗起來：要說來人是萍子吧，恐怕不會鬧出這一套。要不是萍子的話，可又是誰呢？也許就是鶴見剛在樓上所說的「滿洲雌狗」嗎？然而又有些不像，因「雌狗」是同鶴見共乘飛機一路到華北來的，幾小時的同「機」共渡，不能不說「有些面善」。旣然面善，雙方都似乎不應該有這種挑戰式的表演。</p>
<p>「北平衛戌司令部！」那女子冷笑着，把「虎頭牌」扛出來了，「到這裏，一方面要搜查『不穩份子』，另一方面，可不必對你說明，你也問不着—可是，我以現行職權，命你把你在這裏的關係，你的身份，你的姓名，都說出來！」她就用手拿出了記事册，提高了嗓子；找補了一句：「本司令部是有權逮捕『不穩』的『反動份子』的！」她打開記事册，握着筆，候鶴見回話。</p>
<p>這幾句話，勁頭很大，來勢也頗兇，肉裏面包着有骨頭，嚼是有些嚼不動，吞也不能囫國吞下。可惜夾人究竟是個女子，聲音尖了些，也脆了些；加之氣口也單薄了些，免不了有些娘娘腔，這有些像平劇裏喝斷劃陵橋時，張飛口裏的那句詞兒，「戰又不戰，退又不退！」應該猛喝如雷，却呌翠屏山裏的潘巧雲，那麼嗲聲嗲氣地唸了出來，當然有些太不够味兒了。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>好像是蘇格拉底曾經這樣吿誡他的對手：</p>
<p>「你要和我辯論嗎？請先將你所用的每一個名辭下一個適當的定義。」</p>
<p>孔二先生說：「必也，正名乎。</p>
<p>東西二大哲人所見略同！</p>
<p>濫用言辭到濫用地位到濫用關係到濫用……原是有一定的軌迹可循。</p>
<p>顧八奶奶善意地譽陳白露為「香艷」，「肉感」，「大傑作」，推其故在於不能瞭解這些名辭的適當意義，故不能有適當的運用。一切糊裏糊塗的濫用在於人們對眼前的世相沒有正確的認識。</p>
<p>曾憶某顯宦蒞滬，淸貧的大學教授們紛往請為彼等的生活設法，並希望為教授者能得到具體的生活保障。</p>
<p>有一位教授先生沉痛地舉例說：「我們身為教授的生活待遇遠不如飯店裏的茶房。」</p>
<p>某顯家莞爾而笑，很輕鬆地說：</p>
<p>「那末，那末你們去當茶房好了。」</p>
<p>某顯宦不明大學教授在一個國家民族中應有的地位與尊嚴，換言之即不能瞭解「大學教授」四個字適當的意義。</p>
<p>我們實在看不出此顯宦有比顧八奶奶更高明的地方。</p>
<p>鳴呼，糊裘糊塗；此之謂「現狀」。</p>
<p>替「哲學」一辭下定義的人多矣。然而，我却特別喜愛康德的說法——</p>
<p>「哲學乃是明定科學與人生的關係，因而制止知識跋扈的學問。」</p>
<p>照他的看法：科學與思辨沒有絕對的價値，却不過是所以達到最高目的底一種手段。所以對於道德的努力乃是人類最高的義務。</p>
<p>以康德的笨法講來，就是大宇宙的哲學者牛頓不得不把思想界的盟主權讓給小宇宙的哲學者盧騷了。更換言之，自然的客觀的研究，不是思想問題的中心；而道德的主觀的研究，却成為思想問題的中心。這樣，純粹理性失却從來的絕對性，　　　底批判哲學的基調遂被奠定。</p>
<p>別過份相信自己的感覺，即為不可遷移的眞理。如果眞理是頑固者底父親，那種意義下的「孝順」是太不可思議的。</p>
<p>理由似乎很簡單，因為每個人如果都認定本身視野的界域就是世界的界域。這種知識上的謬誤，必不能避免；正有如眼睛所患的謬誤，常令我們想像天與地會相晤於地平綫上一</p>
<p>笑是人類幸運的表徵嗎？你　要考慮你自己的感覺了。</p>
<p>思慮對於任何人在任何時，總是有價値的東西。</p>
<p>「大智若愚」，愚是什麼？我羽那是默默的思慮。那正是一般所謂聰明人所欠缺的。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>吃統莊記</h3>
<p>— 理枝</p>
<p>這一星期來，×路電車上迎續發現有售票員大規模揩油的舉動。依照實際情形看來，這也許是售票查票開車採取的一致行動。落寫字間時候由南向東的車輛，無不擠得滿坑滿谷，而售票員除了向乘客收取車資外，全部不給車票。車子忽停忽行，開得有些出奇。乘客於動盪搖擺中，對於售票員這種「吃統莊」的豪舉且不免為之暗暗担心，然而事實上，查票員也似乎早己忘其任務，從未見他們一躍而上，使從容不迫的售票員感到驚慌失措。售票員曾對艷羨他們額外收入豐富的顧客們訴說「開支浩繁」的苦衷，我們也確實看見過末班電車裏的售票員把一捲鈔票暗暗塞給開車，一切情形說明了這是有計劃的貪汚行為。</p>
<p>我們站在乘客立塲來說，車主因售票揩油以致收入减少時，必然要增價而使我們負担加重，我們為了維護自身利益計，當然要起來主張肅淸。</p>
<p>但是，售票員為什麼要楷油，要貪汚呢？</p>
<p>一般說來，他們之所以揩油，也許是為了收入微細不足以言養家活口，然而癥結所在，無疑的是受了普遍貪汚風氣的影響。舉一近例來說，如某女校長因貪汚行為被一教員指穿，就惱羞成怒，把那教員臉孔打得靑腫，而猶未洩憤時，還拍胸脯說：「你想到××局去吿狀嗎？吿訴你，局裏上上下下那一個不跟我有交情」！（見各報載）那女校長貪汚打人到這樣理直氣壯，無非是為了她與××局大小官員在交情上「吃」了「統荘」。為人師表尚且如此恬不知恥，這就難怪略識之乎的售票員的揩油要越來越兇了。</p>
<p>（按：在博局中頭家獨贏將散將賭住全部吃去，謂之「吃統荘」；但博局中的頭家是需要賭本，且冒危險；如某女校長者，則除以「交情」為賭本外，就什麼風險也沒有了。）</p>
<h3>查票毆辱檢察官</h3>
<p>— 蘅君</p>
<p>友朋相聚，天南地北，拉扯閒談，話鋒轉入報上檢察官林厚祺被公共汽車查票董浩毆辱事件，各就主觀立塲，抒發意見，語雖不了，然頗可窺市民關心之一斑：</p>
<p>朋友甲：「查票執行職務，猶檢察官之偵查案情，此次爭執，起於購票之過站，補票即可了，何必動武」？</p>
<p>朋友乙：「檢察官為國家之執法官，趁坐公用汽車，已屬平民化。竟因小事而遭查票毆辱，可見查票平日跋扈之威」！</p>
<p>朋友丙：「其然，上海之大，交通工具之多，類此事件，更僕難數，董某不幸，適逢林檢察官，致身罹法網」！</p>
<p>朋友丁：「公用事業之服役者，終日碌碌，心情褊急，一違其意，即睚眥以報，老於世故者，必避之」。</p>
<p>朋友甲：「是不盡然，須知人生以服務為目的，待人接物，自宜和易公正，尤其從事公用車輛之上；苟一怨恨，生命亦立可危殆，子之言，無異為之張目」！</p>
<p>朋友乙：「檢察官受辱事小，氣燄固不能任其囂張，董某或逞一時意氣，而主管當局應時時加以督促訓練之」。</p>
<p>朋友丙：「督促訓練之責，實不應由公用局負之，實應由職工會負之，蓋每一工會，必有其宗旨，其宗旨必不嗾使會員動輒凌辱他人」？</p>
<p>朋友丁：「　某業已保釋，違法問題，亦已偵查，諸公譴責，理所當然：惟董某而外，其他忠於職守，熊度和靄亦多；余日前目擊一賣票，扶掖婦孺上下，絕無難色。事後方知乃一教徒，訓練問題，應由教義感化之」。</p>
<p>朋友甲：「迂腐，迂腐！君不聞「十室之內，必有忠信」，售票中偶有芳草；終不敵敗事者多，不信，我儕立可出發，遍試各車，以資徽信」！</p>
<p>朋友乙：「贊成，贊成」！</p>
<p>朋友丙：「…………」</p>
<p>語至此，主婦携其幼子，氣急敗壞而歸；詢其故：始悉由南京路候車多至十餘輛，盡力登車，售票聲色俱厲，議其雇坐人力車，同車者反助其議，無一同情於我，以後誓不趁坐公共車輛也。</p>
<p>四人相顧而視，會談吿終，更不復作實地視察矣。</p>
<h3>喉炎</h3>
<p>— 仕傑</p>
<p>一個靑年，患了嚴重的喉炎，因此只能說出低微的聲音，走過一家剛從鄉下搬來的醫生的診所，他便決定去請他診療一下，他歇了電鈴，醫生的年靑而又美麗的妻子便為他開門。「醫生在家麼？」靑年低聲的問。年靑的妻子便亦以低聲耳語答道：「他不在，請就進來吧！」</p>
<h3>吃飯本領</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>吃飯本領有二說，一是指飯量的大小，一是指謀生的技能。飯量大小要看做本領之一，實在不像一個貧窮的民族。可是仔細一想，却又不錯。原來眞正富裕的民族，他們的食物決不以米麥為主，唯有我們站在饑餓邊綠的人，才三頓儘是拿米飯來塞飽肚子的。用這一個來較量本领，自是又養生，又簡單。</p>
<p>至於把謀生的技能算為吃飯本領，尤其與貧窮有關，所謂謀生者，並非謀一個現代人的合理生活，而祇是吃飯以活命而己。有一决我的一個好意的學生，在背後說我有吃飯本领，因而隨便到什麼地方決不會餓死，於是我的並無好意的太太再把這句話傳給我聽，使我大發脾氣，因為我受了侮辱</p>
<p>「嚇，他把我看成一個混飯吃的人了！」</p>
<p>「能够混飯吃不是一件好事嗎？」</p>
<p>「喔，你認為我這種為文學而文學（寫詩與小說），為藝術而藝術（在台上演戲），以及為改革社會而幹的工作，都不過是混飯吃而已嗎？」</p>
<p>「能够混到飯吃已是上籤了！」</p>
<p>「你把人生的價値看得太低！」</p>
<p>「我們的人生與畜生還有什麼不同？」</p>
<p>「你以為世界上沒有科學，美術，音樂，哲學這些東西嗎？」</p>
<p>「我祗知道科學家，美術家，音樂家，誓學家，一天到晚找飯吃都來不及；我祇知道隔壁她理定教授的兒女們每餐每人祗配給一小盆飯，他的太太哭哭吵吵說他沒有吃飯本領。此外還有什麼本領，還要什麼科學，美術等等勞什子，我就一概不知道了！」</p>
<p>「這末說那個混蛋讚我有吃飯本領還是代我誇揚呢！」</p>
<p>「而且己經是過獎了！」</p>
<h3>說小香桂官—梨園億舊數小生</h3>
<p>— 聽松</p>
<p>程長庚之言曰：人知演戲生旦並重，凡唱對兒戲者，班中若無藝術較高之旦，即不能成班，然欲得一文武兼全之小生，則尤為難能可貴也。故長庚班中，以徐小香為小生台柱，從前四喜三慶兩班，咸以三國戲相競爭，几三國戲中之周瑜，非小香與長庚為配，即全劇頓失精彩。一日程與徐忽以細故相齟齬，小香竟拂袖而去，班中三國戲，乃久久職演，老於聽戲者，咸咎程不能容物，程奮然曰：小生吾亦能之，連演取南郡等諾三國戲，自飾周郎，凡孔明魯肅等則請班中盧台子俞三勝諸名伶為之。三勝即紫雲之父，叔岩之祖，本有活諸葛之綽號也。</p>
<p>小香為蘇人，崑戲小生，拿手尤多，程只能勉强飾皮黃之公瑾，若崑戲中驚夢之柳夢梅，偸詩之濟必正，則無能為役矣。故終必託人疏通，强小香回班，方能合之稱兩美云。</p>
<p>小呌天最重王桂官，桂官為同慶班中小生台柱，譚嘗云：楞仙之藝，唱做念打，無一不曲肖小香，此材良不易得也。王尤以飾公瑾，有活周郎之譽，譚之倚重桂官，非但戲中之趙雲周瑜，均捨王莫屬，雖舉　之　蛟，狀元譜之陳大官，非咸王不可，狀元譜尤以加入羅有歲之墳丁，稱三絕焉。</p>
<h3>「天堂春夢」中之</h3>
<h3>關於報業</h3>
<p>— 企元</p>
<p>報價漲了，「精神食糧」更難以享受。</p>
<p>報館方面有他們的苦衷，明知是「自殺」政策，但是沒有法想，只能走一走「華容道」。</p>
<p>有些報館為了應付常前的危局，减縮篇幅。照理說：報紙的篇幅越是增多，才是「正常」的現象。也是「文化」發達的表現；而現在却是越來越「反常」下去，那不令人感慨萬分。有些報館縮减了篇幅，大量的裁員，社會上就多了一大批失業者，增加了社會經濟問題的嚴重性。這裏，我們不得不指摘，政府對報業不能予以極大的援助，是一個失策。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>同年六月十四日</p>
<p>老祝滿不在乎地橫躺在徐紹明家裏最舒適的一張長沙發上，頭靠着這邊的扶手，脚高擱在另一邊，臉向上，眼睛半閉着，嘴裏在咀嚼內地糖果公司所出的廉價太妃糖；沙發前面的漆得發光的地板上，已零亂地散落着十來張裹糖用的小方形的花紙了，</p>
<p>徐紹明的僕人阿史三番兩次的打會客室的門口邊探進頭來張望。他覺得祝兆年眞是個天字第一號的怪物，這幾天桂林全城的人都在忙着打點逃難，凡來找他主人的人，沒有一個不是為着商量搭車而來的，他主人也是整天在忙着搜集貨物，安排車輛，唯有這個老祝却像沒事一樣的接連來候了三天，每次來總得坐上四五個鐘點，據說為的是要替在前綫打仗的兵捐錢；他主人老是躱着不見他，他也不在乎，一次見不到，再來第二次，白天也來，晚上也來，好像他自己就不想逃難似的。</p>
<p>阿史也開始厭惡老祝了，尤其因為他不停的吃糖，來上半天，包糖的紙就丟了一地，那些紙上都還有餘糖，黏住了地板，眞不容易打掃。</p>
<p>可是老祝今兒平上又說出了一句最可怕的話。他說：</p>
<p>「老徐躱我沒有用！我要是等不到他，就有法兒教他離不得桂林！」</p>
<p>阿史是忠于主人的，方才已在大門口悄悄地吿訴過徐紹明，使徐紹明着實嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>「511，5271，5144，321712，……」會客室裏的惡客，忽而又高聲歌唱起來。阿史是根本不懂歌曲的，這兩年多來他只要看見老祝就聽他在嘴裏這樣哼，哼來哼去，總是這兩三句，有時候人還沒有進來，歌聲已傳進來了。他眞懷疑老祝是有神經病的，為什麼顚來倒去老唱這一個調子？</p>
<p>徐紹明正好也滿頭大汗的趕回來了，在外面院子裏，就聽到了老祝終年不停口在唱着的「結婚進行曲，」不由眉毛一皺，站在水泥舖的花街上遲疑了好半嚮。</p>
<p>「他媽的！這傢伙簡直存心要纏死我！」他在心裏如此咀咒着。「三天連來七次，我再躱他也沒有用。這幾天事情又忙，再給他繼下去，必然躭誤了正經。。……沒有辦法，化幾個寃錢吧……！」</p>
<p>他知道老祝的牛性一發是不可收拾的，再若避而不見，說不定他會鬧得更不可開交起來。（九）</p>

<h3>Taipei and Keelung Riots Unabated, Government Agencies Attacked by Rioters; Central Government to Send Minister Bai for Condolences</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] The superficial calm of the past five days has been shattered by the continuous gunfire of last night. Young rioters from Taiwan attacked the Keelung Fortress Command at 2 PM yesterday, resulting in two deaths. Keelung was immediately placed under martial law, and rioters in Taipei also launched attacks in groups. At 10:30 PM last night, the Yuanshan Naval Office was the first to be attacked. Other rioters attacked the Supply Bureau, warehouses, the Garrison Headquarters, the Army Hospital, and government offices. The sound of rifles, machine guns, and grenades filled the air for about an hour. Yang Liangong, the Supervisory Commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, arrived at Keelung Port yesterday afternoon on the Hai Ping ship, having departed from Fujian. He was only able to disembark at 10 PM. Accompanying him were two battalions of military police. Yang and his staff member Liu Qikun also traveled on a truck carrying the military police, departing from Keelung at 2 AM this morning. En route, they were intercepted by rioters, and gunfire was exchanged. One military policeman was injured, and Liu Qikun's finger was severed. Yang was fortunate to have moved his seat earlier, avoiding injury, but he was still shaken and even fell out of the vehicle. They finally arrived in Taipei at 3 AM. According to Yang, "The rioters are carrying rifles, grenades, and small cannons." Gunfire continued unabated throughout the night in Taipei, and the number of casualties is unknown. The entire city has been placed under martial law since 6 AM, with the military and police deployed to posts, prohibiting rioters from moving in groups. Gunfire is still frequent. It is reported that Commander Chen is still determined to fulfill all the promises he made, but is determined to stop the illegal behavior of the rioters. The 32 demands made yesterday by the "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" clearly aim to resist the central government, and Commander Chen expressed great anger after learning of this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 8th] Members of the "Loyalty and Righteousness Service Corps" and young students, who are responsible for maintaining public order among the civilians here, have been searching the residences of mainlanders here day and night for the past three days. They claim to be searching for civilian firearms, but documents are also being inspected, and money, watches, clothing, and items are openly looted. They conduct searches street by street, and some residences have even been looted more than four times. In addition to looting, they also create acts of terror. A Taiwanese person threw a grenade into Ge Jing'en's residence, and when Mrs. Ge smelled the sulfur, a mainlander servant had already been slightly injured. Mr. and Mrs. Ge have moved into the public residence tonight. Commander Chen has been residing and holding office in the public office since "February 28th." All department heads also reside in the office. Commander Chen's brother, Chen Gongquan's residence, was also searched today. Our office had three bicycles and eight sets of clothes stolen last night. Four telephones are still out of service this afternoon, making communication impossible. These illegal acts of disturbance day and night have made it difficult for mainlanders here to live and eat in peace. They are now eager to leave. In the past two days, several thousand mainlanders have registered for ship tickets at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. A staff member of a certain province at the Compilation and Translation Office suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown today. The stimulation they have received can be imagined. Zhou Yiying, the Director of Civil Affairs of the Public Office, went to the "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" this afternoon to negotiate, demanding that the committee stop the search of residences.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] It is heard that the central government will send Minister Bai Chongxi to Taiwan for condolences.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops in Western Shanxi Cross the Yellow River; Being Transferred to Yan'an and Concentrated in the Southeast</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 9th] Communist troops in western Shanxi are constantly being transferred back to Yan'an for concentration. After the 235th Brigade was transferred west, the 358th Brigade also secretly crossed the Yellow River, joining the ranks south and southeast of Yan'an. The original 1st and 2nd Training Brigades defending this area have been combined into a Training Brigade, all of which are central troops of the CCP. Its brigade headquarters and the 3rd Regiment are still defending Jinpenwan, 15 kilometers southeast of Yan'an. All military institutions in Yan'an are concentrated in this area, making it an important stronghold. The 2nd Regiment is stationed in Linfen in the middle reaches of the Fen River, where heavy troops are also gathered. The 1st Regiment is stationed in Kuangxian, the first gateway on the highway from Guanzhong into the Yan'an area. Also, the pocket-shaped positions in Yijun and Malan were quickly resolved this time. Hu Jingduo, the commander of the communist troops in the area, was dismissed and transferred. Yang Jimin, the son of Yang Hucheng, succeeded him, with his command post set up in Shuijiaping. Small groups still appear in this mountainous area from time to time.</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong's Whereabouts Are Mysterious</h3>
<p>[United Press, Yan'an, 9th] Well-informed sources told the United Press today: CCP leader Mao Zedong's whereabouts are uncertain and rarely seen. His residence is moved almost every week to avoid possible air raids and maintain a quiet environment for his demanding work. Only a few key CCP officials and his bodyguards, who never leave his side, know Mao's exact address.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Goes to Baoding; No Major Changes in the Personnel of the Pacification Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Sun Lianzhong is scheduled to go to Baoding on the morning of the 10th. He gave a speech to officers and soldiers on the afternoon of the 9th. He told reporters about the current situation in Hebei Province, saying that after the recent cleanup of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, most of the main force of the communist troops, except for those who were defeated, had fled into the mountains. Although there are still a considerable number of communist troops operating near Xushui and Mancheng, they are not enough to threaten the safety of the transportation line. The national army is not taking any major actions at the moment, but it can control the communist troops' disturbances. There are no large groups of communist troops north of the Yongding River. There has been tension in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway recently. Those who have fled from Shandong Province to the Cangxian area seem to be mostly defeated troops, and the national army has taken strict precautions. There have been no major incidents on both lines of the Beining Railway. The situation is best in Luannan, Changli, and Fengrun counties in eastern Hebei. To make them demonstration counties for the implementation of the New Administration, they are actively training cadres below the township level, a total of nine thousand people. The communist troops currently existing in eastern Hebei are still the approximately 10,000 troops under Li Yunchang, who are entrenched in the mountains of Jixian and Zunhua and cause occasional disturbances.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 9th] Sun Lianzhong is scheduled to come to Baoding on the 10th to preside over the opening of the first Provisional Assembly of Hebei Province and the establishment of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters. After the reorganization of the Commander-in-Chief's Office into the Pacification Headquarters, it is scheduled to move from Beiping to Baoding within this month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The 11th War Zone Commander-in-Chief's Office was reorganized into the Baoding Pacification Headquarters on the 1st of this month. The internal personnel arrangements have been announced, with no major changes.</p>
<h3>Alarming Situation in Eastern Jilin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 8th] The tense situation on the northwest sides of Jilin has eased slightly, but the east side is now alarming. At 6 PM last night, 4,000 well-equipped communist troops from the Jiahe area were suddenly discovered east of Laoye Ridge. At Tiangang, about 25 li southeast of Dongbeicha, about 10,000 communist troops were discovered this morning. Also, a large number of communist troops of unknown numbers have gathered near Huadian and Panshi south of Jilin. The national army is on strict alert.</p>
<h3>Close Relationship Between the CCP and North Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] The New York Herald Tribune published a dispatch from Seoul by its reporter Steel on the front page today. The headline was "Close Relationship Between the CCP and the Soviet-Occupied Area of North Korea." The article stated that according to some signs, the CCP and the communist authorities in North Korea have a close cooperation agreement. It also stated that according to reliable news obtained from the Soviet-occupied area, North Korea and China have a relationship, and a large number of Korean troops have entered Korean territory from the Northeast for several months, and have now become a powerful force in the North Korean government army supported by the Soviet Union. The number of troops is 50,000, and the troops are mixed with many soldiers who stayed in the Northeast after Japan surrendered. Their leaders are trainees from Yan'an, and some are graduates of CCP military and political schools. Their supreme leader is Kim Mu-jong (transliteration). He is a veteran CCP member and also a Korean national who once lived in Yan'an. He then served as the commander of the Korean Volunteer Army. Now he is the commander of the newly established "Security Army" in North Korea, which is a mere name. This group of soldiers and North Korean police will become the core of the army, because in the Soviet-occupied area of Korea, a large number of people have been conscripted for unknown reasons. "Although the Koreans trained in Yan'an are mainly involved in the military aspects of the North Korean regime, some also hold key political positions." The relationship between the Korean communists trained in China and the more extreme Korean communists trained in the Soviet Union who control the North Korean government is not always good, but most of their major differences in policy and strategy have been resolved. Some people who believe that communism is too extreme for Korea have moved to South Korea under US occupation. They will advocate a more moderate front there. Koreans in the "Communist Democratic Allied Army" in Northeast China began to move into North Korea in early autumn last year and are still continuing. This movement is said to be carried out in accordance with the instructions of Yan'an to the Northeast CCP. It is said that this instruction emphasizes the importance of close cooperation between the Chinese and Korean parties, and this connection may become more important if the Soviet Union withdraws from North Korea. The CCP still controls most of the Sino-Korean border area, so they can easily supply food and military supplies to the Korean communists if necessary. Therefore, if the US and Soviet troops withdraw, this assistance from the CCP can become a decisive factor in the communization of the entire Korea. Unlike the Soviet Union, the CCP is not prohibited or hindered by any international treaties. Moreover, there are many Korean immigrants in the backward villages of Northeast China controlled by the CCP. This is a rich human resource reserve, and the mountainous area bordering Northeast Korea can be used as a good base for training future Korean guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Talks About the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Our reporter met Mr. Hu Shi at the International Hotel yesterday. He flew directly to this city from Beiping on the 6th.</p>
<p>The reporter asked Mr. Hu for a historical perspective on national affairs. He initially refused, believing that "history never repeats itself," making it difficult to make comparisons. Later, he said: China, as an unprepared country, has encountered an unprecedented eight-year war in history. The current difficulties are a natural phenomenon. Many diseases are inherited from history, and we cannot escape reality. Although the World War has ended, countries have not yet returned to normal. Not to mention Britain and France, even the United States, which is as rich as it is, has suffered the least direct damage from the war, but travel and housing have still not returned to the pre-war situation.</p>
<p>Hu believes that cooperation between the KMT and the CCP is unlikely. He said: "In the past, I wrote to Mao Zedong, asking the CCP to be the Labor Party of China. It was a gentleman's love for others with virtue. Now I admit that it was too optimistic. It was a historical mistake of Hu Shi." British and American-style political parties are fundamentally different from Soviet-style political parties. The British Labor Party is now the ruling party. If it fails in the general election three years later, it will withdraw from the government without mobilizing military force to maintain its regime. Can the Communist Party do this?</p>
<p>When talking about reorganizing the government, Hu repeatedly said he had no opinions. He said: "The newspapers say that he is going to participate in the government, which is completely unfounded." "The number of true liberals in China is already very small. It is also very necessary to leave these people outside the government to work for the country and for the people. My friends understand this, and the government also understands this. What is rumored outside is completely unfounded."</p>
<p>Regarding the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, Hu said: Because he is too busy, he has no time to read foreign newspapers and has not yet studied international politics.</p>

(4) At least two-thirds of the heads of provincial departments must be filled by individuals who have resided in the province for more than ten years (preferably the Secretary-General, and the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Industry and Mining, Agriculture and Forestry, Education, and Police departments should be filled in this way).

<p>[This newspaper's report] According to a certain person who recently came from Taiwan: The "February 28th" incident in Taipei, where a local disturbance occurred between a minor riot and military police, sparked unrest in various places and served as the fuse for the general Taiwanese population's misunderstanding that the Taiwan Chief Executive system was the same as the Governor-General system during the Japanese era. The general public was dissatisfied with the Chief Executive system and the monopoly system. Long-standing grievances were escalating daily. In addition, the authorities failed to take effective measures to address last year's food shortage in Taiwan. The public's sense of insecurity reached its peak. Even a minor conflict could easily lead to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The Handling Committee Regards Itself as the Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] The Taiwan Province "February 28th" Incident Handling Committee actually regards itself as the government and will establish a handling bureau to handle the aftermath and a political affairs bureau responsible for planning political reforms. The political affairs bureau will be established before March 15th. The method of its formation is that each township and district will elect one candidate representative, and then the county and city councils will elect from them. The allocation of seats is as follows: Taipei City 2 seats, Taipei County 3 seats, Keelung City 1 seat, Hsinchu City 1 seat, Hsinchu County 3 seats, Taichung City 1 seat, Taichung County 4 seats, Changhua City 1 seat, Chiayi City 1 seat, Tainan City 1 seat, Tainan County 4 seats, Kaohsiung City 1 seat, Kaohsiung County 3 seats, Pingtung City 1 seat, Penghu County 1 seat, Hualien County 1 seat, Taitung County 1 seat, totaling 30 seats.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Taiwan Province "February 28th" Incident Handling Committee today issued a message stating: In order to prevent the movement of goods and materials and financial assets of government-owned and provincial-operated companies, until the resolution of the incident, any illegal movement or sale will be reported and exposed by the committee. Furthermore, if illegal sales and movements are discovered in the future, they will be strictly investigated and prosecuted. It is hoped that compatriots and employees of various provincial-operated companies will monitor each other and actively report to the committee in order to protect national property. It is reported that the committee is currently preparing to take over public enterprises. Supervisory personnel will be appointed. As for rumors about mainland personnel, it is also hoped that they will be employed. In short, all measures are exactly the same as the steps taken by the government in October 1945 when it took over various enterprises from the Japanese, which is truly both laughable and infuriating!</p>

<h3>The Government Plans to Formulate Supporting Emergency Measures Policies to Guide Floating Capital into Production and Adopt Incentive Measures for Handling Overseas Deposits</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing, 9th] According to an authoritative economist, a top economic decision-maker in the country, who told this newspaper's reporter on the morning of the 9th: After the implementation of the economic emergency measures plan, the government is formulating various policies to support it. He believes that after the above measures are implemented one by one, the national economy is expected to return to a normal state within eight or nine months, inflation can be prevented from expanding, and prosperity can be entered. It is said that the purpose of the emergency plan is only to assist in solving economic problems with political power, and the fundamental policy to be implemented is to use the power of the economy itself to guide all funds into legitimate production channels, and to solve economic problems in an economic way. At present, balancing the national budget by simply starting with expenditures is not easy. The authorities recently convened those in charge of various agencies and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to discuss ways to reduce unnecessary expenditures, and they all agreed that this matter is full of difficulties. However, in terms of increasing revenue, he believes that 70-80% can be achieved. On the one hand, this matter depends on increasing tax revenue, but turning state-owned enterprises into private enterprises can also increase national treasury revenue. Regarding this matter, Deputy Premier Weng has put forward a specific number, which may be further increased in the future. The main purpose of the above-mentioned and other necessary measures is to increase production. This will be seriously discussed at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The main points of the method are that the main conditions for national banks and private banks lending to industrial and agricultural groups are "the borrowed products must be returned after the loan, and after the contract is concluded, the bank will use 70% of the loan to order raw materials from merchants on behalf of the government, the manufacturers will manufacture them, and then return the products to the government, and collect all the interest." If this is the case, most of the raw materials and daily necessities made from raw materials can be controlled by the government, and there will be no more phenomena of floating capital and hoarding of daily necessities, which would endanger people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing, 9th] The measures for handling overseas deposits have been reviewed and approved by the Economic Policy Committee. It is said that the main points of the measures are to use incentive methods to allow overseas deposits to return to the country and engage in production.

As for the method proposed by some legislators to requisition a portion by the government, it seems difficult to adopt because the current situation is peacetime and cannot be compared with wartime. It is also heard that regarding the method of disposing of overseas deposits, the government is negotiating with foreign countries through diplomatic channels.</p>

<h3>The Hong Kong Government Oppresses Overseas Chinese and Controls New Territories Agricultural Products</h3>

<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party Establishes Branches in Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Huadong News Agency, this city's report] According to people from Northeast China: After the victory, the Democratic Socialist Party sent people to Northeast China to develop organizational work. Initially, the people of Northeast China were quite unfamiliar with the situation of the party, so there was no progress. Later, the Soviet Union stationed in Northeast China, and the Communist Party's various measures in Northeast China caused the local people to be dissatisfied with the status quo, prompting the party to develop rapidly. It is heard that the person in charge of the Democratic Socialist Party in Northeast China is Kuang Sheng, and branches have been established in dozens of regions including Jilin, Changchun, Jinzhou, Shenyang, and Andong.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Transportation Capacity in Northeast China The Export Volume of Soybeans Is Still Small</h3>
<p>Egypt Can Realize the Purchase Soon</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 9th] Since the export of soybeans in Northeast China began, most of them have been exported to the United Kingdom and Denmark. Recently, Egypt is also in contact to purchase them, which will be realized soon. In recent months, the export of soybeans has been only tens of thousands of tons. The reason is that the transportation capacity is insufficient. The transportation capacity in the entire Northeast is only 600,000 tons per month. Military transportation accounts for 150,000 tons, the materials of the units under the Resources Committee account for 100,000 tons, and soybeans and various commercial trades account for 50,000 tons.</p>

<p>[This newspaper's Kunming, 9th] The borders of Sichuan, Yunnan, Kangding, and Guizhou are mountainous, barren, and poor. There are the most bandits. When troops are sent to suppress them, the bandits turn into small groups and disguise themselves as good people. When the troops leave, they gather in the mountains and forests and become bandits again. It is not easy to suppress them. Chief of Staff Chen of the Ministry of National Defense specially telegraphed the authorities of the four provinces, ordering the affiliated troops and local teams to earnestly suppress them, and work with local party groups to rectify the baojia organization and strictly prevent them. If banditry occurs again, the baojia personnel shall be subject to joint and several punishment.</p>

<p>We read the news item "Rumors of Communist Army Fleeing to Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang Province Tightens Defense" on page two of your newspaper on March 7, which stated that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu had crossed south and fled into Jinshan, Qingpu, and other counties, causing disturbances, and that some residents of Jinshan had fled to Zhejiang Province. After investigation, our county has never had a Communist army from northern Jiangsu flee into it, and residents have not fled to Zhejiang Province. A few days ago, the Tenth District Commissioner's Office of Zhejiang Province called to inform us of this rumor, and the Jiashan County Government of Zhejiang Province also sent personnel to Jinshan to inquire about this matter, and the replies were all that it was not the truth. We hereby request that you investigate and correct this matter.</p>

<h3>Yellow River Water Level Rises Again, Embankment Collapses at Garden Mouth, Situation Serious, Water Release Delayed</h3>
<p>[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 9th] Since the Garden Mouth was blocked using the old method, the mouth is now only thirteen meters wide. The original plan was to close the gap from the 6th to the 15th. In recent days, spring water levels have risen. On the 7th, the flood control embankment at the eastern dam head collapsed, affecting the closing project. All employees are working hard to repair the damage. If there are no other obstacles, the closing of the mouth can definitely be completed by the 20th. At the same time, the Dazi River is still being dug, with a diversion channel about thirty li (Chinese mile) long. Water will only be released after the closing project is completed so that the Dazi River directly flushes silt eastward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The water level of the Yellow River in Shanzhou has recently risen again. On the 7th, the flow once increased to 860 cubic meters per second. The western bank of the Garden Mouth has collapsed six or seven times within a week, and the situation is quite serious. The diversion channel dug in the old riverbed downstream of the mouth was originally planned to release water on the 8th, but it has now been decided to delay it for a few days. Before the old embankment is out of danger, this water release, which is coordinated with the closing project, will naturally be postponed temporarily.</p>

<h3>A Major Test for the Moscow Conference</h3>
<p>The delegations of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France arrived together in Moscow yesterday. The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which is being watched by the world, opened today at the Moscow Air Force Club. This is the first Foreign Ministers Conference of 1947, and also the most important international conference since the war. The safety of the world and the happiness of mankind will depend on the outcome of this international conference. The biggest task of this Foreign Ministers Conference is to first draw up a draft treaty with Germany by the four foreign ministers, and then decide on a peace conference with Germany, so as to make the final decision on the treaty with Germany, so that post-war Europe can return to normal as soon as possible. The signing of the treaty with Germany will not only solve all the problems related to Germany but also be a model for the treaty with Japan, which will have a very important impact on the overall world situation in the future. Therefore, the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is not only what the four powers attending the meeting have great expectations for, but all other countries in the world are also expressing concern and attention to the opening of this international conference.</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, it has been nearly two years in Europe, and nearly a year and a half in the Far East. Mankind has suffered the cruel lessons of this war and, awed by the threat of atomic energy and other weapons of mass destruction, all yearn for the post-war world to step into a new era of peace and democracy as soon as possible, where everyone can live freely and peacefully coexist, and no longer suffer the threat of war. However, the post-war international situation has been turbulent, with one wave rising after another. Until the Paris Peace Conference last year, it was about to draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. After that, the four foreign ministers met in New York, and the opinions of the four powers gradually converged, which allowed the turbulent world situation after the war to achieve a peaceful outcome. Commentators said that the first step in cleaning up the post-war mess is to conclude treaties with Germany and Japan. However, now these two major culprits of the war are ignored, and instead, treaties are signed with these dependent countries Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, which inevitably feels like "abandoning the root and cherishing the branches." However, on the other hand, "avoiding the important and taking the easy" is one of the means in diplomacy. Since the opinions of various countries on the most important issues of Germany and Japan after the war cannot be unified, it is better to leave them aside for the time being and discuss them after the time is ripe. Therefore, the failure to conclude treaties with Germany and Japan for a long time is not so much a failure of international coordination after the war as a delaying tactic by diplomats from various countries. Rather than rushing to do things and forcing the conclusion of treaties with Germany and Japan, it is better to be cautious and wait for the right moment. Therefore, we do not feel that it is too late to postpone the German issue until today before we can discuss it. We only hope that the four powers can consider the overall situation of the world, sincerely exchange opinions, seek a thorough solution to the German issue, which is related to the fate of Europe, and no longer delay.</p>
<p>Since the main topic of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is various issues related to Germany, the task of this conference is to solve these problems. However, the scope of the so-called German problem is very broad and the content is extremely complex. It is not an easy task to complete this task. We also know the difficulties of the Moscow Conference from common sense. At the same time, if we analyze the speeches made by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on their way to the conference, we can understand that we cannot be too optimistic about the success of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. For example, when US Secretary of State Marshall left Washington, he said: "The work of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is extremely difficult. The treaty with Germany may not be drafted during the conference. The purpose of this conference is only to reach an agreement on the basic points of the treaty with Germany. If this goal can be achieved, I will be very happy." British Foreign Secretary Bevin also made a speech when he arrived in Warsaw, saying: "I hope that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be successful in solving the German problem. If I did not have this hope, I would not have traveled a long distance to Moscow." The attitude of French Foreign Minister Bidault is even more pessimistic. He told Polish reporters in Warsaw: "The scope of the German problem is vast. It is extremely difficult to solve the German problem as a whole. However, it is equally difficult to solve each individual problem related to Germany separately."</p>
<p>From this statement, it is not an easy task to thoroughly solve the German problem in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. However, the German problem is the core of post-war international problems. Whether it can be solved has a great impact on Europe and even the entire world, so it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the politicians and diplomats of the four countries should do their best and use all their efforts to seek a solution to the German problem in this Moscow Conference. At the same time, peace-loving people all over the world should also provide spiritual support for the Foreign Ministers Conference to ensure the success of this Moscow Conference and open a new page in the history of the post-war peace movement. As US foreign policy expert Dulles said: "People sacrificed millions in wartime, but their ideals continue to exist. We who have been spared from death have a sacred responsibility to respect the wishes of the dead and create world peace. We will do our best to achieve this goal when we go to Moscow. However, in order to be successful, we still need the American people to support us spiritually." As long as the people of the world are united in supporting the Foreign Ministers Conference, and only allow success and not failure, we believe that no matter how broad the scope of the German problem is, no matter how complex the content of the German problem is, and no matter how divided the opinions of the four powers on the German problem are, this Moscow Conference will be able to close satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Finally, we cannot but reiterate our country's attitude towards the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. Today's China is probably the most peaceful country in the current international relations, and has the same obligations as the four powers to world peace and international cooperation. We always seek the success of peace-making and always yearn for the realization of true peace, especially holding unlimited hope for this Foreign Ministers Conference that drafts a treaty with Germany. We not only hope that the four powers can seek a thorough solution to the German problem but also sincerely hope that the four powers can also reach a compromise on other international issues and become the starting point for the four powers to work together in the future. However, regarding our country's own problems, we believe that we can find a way to solve them ourselves, without the four powers worrying about our country. If the four powers include the China problem on the agenda, it will not only hurt our country's dignity and undermine the position that our country should have in the international community but also be enough to create a gradual process of international interference, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country. Our country's diplomatic authorities have already notified the four powers that the China problem must not be included on the agenda. The diplomatic authorities of the four countries have not expressed any objection, and our concerns no longer exist. However, it seems inevitable that the China problem will be involved inside and outside the conference, so we have to appeal loudly to the four powers, demanding that international justice not be ignored. The Yalta Conference of the past must not be allowed to be repeated today. I remember that after the secret Yalta resolution was announced in February last year, the world's opinions were in an uproar. Not only did the people of our country unanimously express indignation, but even fair-minded people in the United States unanimously condemned it as an act of betrayal. Therefore, if our country is not allowed to participate in this Moscow Conference, it has no right to discuss the China problem; without our country's consent, it should not make any agreement of any nature. This is the unanimous public opinion of the people of our country, and it is also the voice of international justice. Whether international politics can be based on justice in the future to conclude a just, reasonable, and lasting peace, and whether the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference respects the public opinion of our country, is a major test at present.</p>

<h3>Laying the Foundation for Lasting Peace in Europe: Foreign Ministers Conference Opens Today, Soviet Side Expresses Optimism About the Future</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 9th Radio: US Secretary of State Marshall and his entourage arrived in Moscow by plane at 3:30 pm today. French Foreign Minister Bidault also arrived at noon on the same day. The Soviet side only sent Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to the station to greet him. There was no military music or other ceremony, just as British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 9th] Marshall said upon disembarking, "There is no doubt that we will encounter difficulties here, but these difficulties have been dealt with before and have been quite successful. I firmly believe that we will reach an agreement through peaceful negotiations to promote the peace goals that we all care about very much."</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 9th] People here are increasingly convinced today that the Soviet Union will propose a plan for Germany and take active actions to break the deadlock between the major powers on the eve of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. This belief comes from officials on the Soviet side, which is quite noteworthy. Officials on the Soviet side are quite optimistic about whether concrete decisions can be reached in the future, which is the opposite of the pessimism expressed by the British and American delegations about the chances of the conference's success. However, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky of the Soviet Union also said when welcoming British Foreign Secretary Bevin that he hoped he had slept well on the way to Moscow, because he could not guarantee anything after Monday, which is also quite intriguing.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 9th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to open tomorrow, and preparations are in full swing. The meeting place seems to be definitely in the Air Force Club, formerly the Yalta Restaurant in the Imperial Russian era, but the official announcement has not yet been made. The houses where foreign guests are staying have been greatly renovated. In front of the Moscow Hotel, the latest-style cars are lined up in a long snake array. The waitresses of the Capital Hotel have also changed into new clothes, and other people such as elevator drivers, waiters, and children have also changed into new uniforms with high collars and copper buttons. The Cultural Relations Association has specially dispatched many female secretaries who can speak English to be stationed in the Moscow Hotel, and a small shop has been newly added to sell various gifts. Each member of the British delegation can only receive an extra allowance of five pounds for overseas service per day, and their behavior is expected to be modest. The lack of English translation will be the most difficult thing for foreign guests. The salary of the drivers used by foreign guests, including the monthly salary of the driver, is a total of seven thousand rubles. After the meeting starts on Monday, the first item on the agenda will be to discuss the report of the Berlin Allied Control Council. This document can fully show the differences in opinions of the four powers. Judging from the recent Soviet propaganda, the most difficult to solve should be the problem of economic integration of the British and American zones in Germany. The Soviet Union has previously criticized it most severely. Secondly, the future form of government in Germany, the western border of Poland, and the fate of the Ruhr-Rhine region are all the most troublesome problems. As for the Austrian problem, although there are still some unresolved points, it is expected that there will not be much difficulty in the discussion.</p>
<h3>German Treaty to Discuss Five Major Problems</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 8th] Although the four foreign ministers discussed the German problem in June last year, and the four foreign resolutions also discussed it for more than a month, the four foreign ministers will still start the discussion of the German problem from the very beginning this time. The result of this conference will determine whether the East and West countries can eliminate the dozens of disputes over the German problem, especially avoiding the permanent division of Germany. The economic integration of the British and American occupation zones is also one of the key problems, because the Soviet Union believes that this will inevitably lead to the permanent division of Germany into two.</p>
<p>The agenda of this conference divides the German problem into the following five topics: (1) "The future political organization of Germany." The United States advocates the establishment of a German Federal Republic with scattered power. The United Kingdom agrees with this point in principle, but France advocates that the federal organization of Germany should be in the most scattered form. (2) "The eastern border issue of Germany and Poland." The United States believes that the Oder-Neisse line is not the final decision and seems to need to be revised. The United Kingdom and France do not seem to attach so much importance to this. The Soviet Union firmly opposes the revision and believes that the temporary border line decided by the Potsdam Conference should be maintained. (3) "The western border issue of Germany, including the Ruhr and Saar regions." France strongly advocates merging the Saar region and international control of the Ruhr and Rhine regions. The Soviet Union has always attached importance to using Germany's existing industry as reparations, so it advocates joint management of the Ruhr region by the four countries as a treaty in the peace treaty. (4) "The issue of reparations." The Soviet Union intends to obtain existing industries and production tools worth tens of billions of dollars as reparations. The United Kingdom and the United States have expressed opposition to this. France may agree to this, but the Soviet Union requires France to make some concessions. (5) "The issue of disarmament, purging of Nazis, and democratization." The Soviet Union accuses Western countries of not actively devoting themselves to this and failing to implement the Potsdam Agreement. This is the first problem in the report of the Four-Power Control Committee in Germany.</p>
<h3>Freedom of the Press During the Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] McDermott, Director of Intelligence of the US State Department, recently declared: I have just received a notification from Sinitsyn, Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, that radio commentators can broadcast on Moscow Radio during the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. From the 10th of this month, the opening day of the conference, foreign journalists can send news about the conference situation without inspection, but they must indicate the words "Foreign Ministers Conference" on the telegram.</p>
<h3>Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union Visits British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 9th Dispatch] Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chuan Bingchang, visited British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the British Embassy this morning, and the conversation lasted for about 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Polish-Czech Treaty Signed Today</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 8th] Officials recently announced that Poland and the Czech Republic will sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance here on the 10th. Czech Prime Minister Gottwald will lead a delegation to arrive here at noon on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Italian Demands for Reparations from Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 9th] Republican presidential candidate Stassen, who is on his way to the Moscow Conference, met with Italian Prime Minister Gasperi here. Gasperi said that Italy also has demands on Germany, namely (1) compensation for the materials destroyed by the German army in Italy during the war, and (2) the industrial materials, works of art, and gold removed by the German army should be returned to Italy.</p>
<h3>German Central Government Will Be Established Sooner or Later</h3>
<p>Views of German Political Leaders</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 8th] Kassel, leader of the Christian Democratic Party, said in a speech in Leipzig today that the Allied Control Council for Germany will authorize Germany to establish a central administrative organization, so the German government will be established sooner or later.</p>
<h3>Stalin Explains the Mistakes of German Commanders</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] Marshal Stalin recently replied to Colonel Lanjing, a professor at the Soviet Military Academy, explaining a military issue. Stalin said: It is by no means accidental that German Generals Ludendorff and Seeckt led to Germany's two defeats, one after the other. This is because the strategy taught by the famous German military theorist Clausewitz to German officers has proven ineffective in both world wars. Lenin, the father of the Soviet Union, was only concerned about Clausewitz in order to study his theory of the relationship between war and politics. Clausewitz was born in an era of melee combat, while we were born in an era of machine warfare. The difference lies here.</p>
<h3>France is Formulating a New Policy on the Vietnam Problem, The Silence of the Hanoi War is Related to This</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 8th] The newly appointed special envoy to Vietnam, Bollaert, declared today that the French government is formulating a new policy on the Vietnamese rebellion. According to a dispatch from Vietnam, not a single shot was fired in Hanoi in the past 24 hours, and there were only small-scale military activities in Haiphong, Nam Dinh, and other places. Some observers believe that the silence of the war is waiting for France to announce a new policy.</p>
<h3>Britain Equips the French Army for the Vietnam War</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 8th] Reliable sources here say that in the past sixteen months, the value of military equipment directly supplied by Britain to the French army in Vietnam has reached 17.5 million pounds. In addition, according to the recent British-French agreement, Britain will supply France with various equipment worth 1.76 million pounds, including aircraft, artillery, parachutes, trucks, uniforms, and camping equipment, to equip a paratrooper division. The French Navy has also ordered 92 warships from Britain, totaling 117,000 tons, most of which are still under construction, with a total order of 11,416,000 yuan. According to the British-French agreement of September 10, 1945, Britain agreed to sell enough war equipment to France to equip three infantry divisions and one brigade of the French Far East Army, and some engineering and paratrooper units. The recent British equipment for the French paratrooper division is not within the scope of the previous agreement and was negotiated by French Chief of Staff Tassigny in London last November. Since the end of the war, British and French officers and technicians have been studying each other's military technology.</p>

<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 9th] Sano Manabu, the leader of the Japanese Communist Party's conversion faction, formed the Labor-Peasant Vanguard Party today and decided on election countermeasures, party regulations, declarations, etc. Sano himself was appointed as the chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and Kazama Johei was appointed as the secretary-general. Sano once served as the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, but was later arrested in Shanghai. In 1933, he declared his conversion in prison and became a "national socialist" who advocated that the nation is superior to class. Kazama served as the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Communist Party in 1931, and declared his conversion after being arrested.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Breakdown of Negotiations with the Soviet Union; Argentina Launches Anti-Communist Campaign; America's Fearful Mentality Dissipates</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, 8th] With the upcoming Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, the Argentine government has launched an anti-communist movement, coinciding with the breakdown of negotiations between Argentina and the Soviet Union for a friendship treaty. Argentine President Perón stated in a speech to Congress yesterday that communists are the enemy of our country and saboteurs of the Five-Year Plan. Our government issued a ban on the Communist Party in 1940, which was lifted in 1945. Such a ban may be reimplemented at any time. Furthermore, Argentine newspapers have unofficially hinted at the possibility of banning activities by national enemies and traitors, and stated that the investigative authorities have launched an anti-communist movement. It is reported that the Soviet economic delegation, which had come here to negotiate a friendship, commercial, and navigation treaty between the two countries, recently returned home abruptly, symbolizing the renewed tension in relations between Argentina and the Soviet Union. Some people in the United States originally feared that the improvement of relations between Argentina and the Soviet Union would allow the Soviet Union to gain a foothold in the Americas. However, since the Argentine President recently delivered a statement in Congress elaborating on the national political situation and announcing the breakdown of negotiations between Argentina and the Soviet Union, such fears should dissipate.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops in Hungary Order Arrests; Soviets Refute U.S. Interference; Deny Depriving Smallholders Party of Legitimate Privileges</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Hungarian Capital, 9th] The U.S. note presented to the Soviet Union on the 6th of this month, opposing the order by the Soviet military authorities to arrest former Secretary-General Kovács of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, has been refuted by Soviet commander Sviridov in Hungary. It is stated that the order and democratic regime of Hungary are not threatened by left-wing parties. The so-called deprivation of the legitimate privileges of the Smallholders Party and the intention to establish a dictatorship should not be blamed on left-wing parties. On the contrary, conspirators attempting to abolish the Constitution and overthrow the Republic are threatening the order and democratic regime of Hungary. This has been frequently acknowledged by the Smallholders Party itself, and leaders of the party, such as the current Secretary-General and Prime Minister Nagy, have made statements to this effect. If a majority of the Smallholders Party members participated in the conspiracy, then left-wing parties and the police cannot be held responsible. Furthermore, Smallholders Party members who participated in the conspiracy have confessed their crimes and agreed to forfeit their parliamentary privileges when they were elected. Therefore, there is no basis for the claim that left-wing parties are seeking a compromise with the leaders of the Smallholders Party. The conspiracy has been investigated and will soon be submitted to the Hungarian independent democratic court for handling. Therefore, I cannot accept your suggestion of jointly studying the situation in Hungary and the conspiracy, as this constitutes interference in the internal affairs of Hungary. Kovács was arrested by the Soviet military authorities for violating the legitimate rights of the Soviet occupation authorities, and your interference in this matter is also unacceptable to me. In short, the Soviet military authorities have grounds for this action and are not interfering in the internal affairs of Hungary. A copy of this Soviet response has also been sent to the British representative on the Control Council.</p>
<h3>Situation in Southern Korea Remains Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>Syngman Rhee's Attitude Is Very Cautious</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 9th] The director of the U.S. Information Service in Korea, Mr. Dunbar, who attended a meeting in Washington, stated upon arriving here today that if the United States cannot find a way to resolve the Korean issue in the next few days or weeks, the U.S.'s democratic struggle in Asia will surely fail, and there is a possibility of losing the fight for peace in the Far East. General Hodge told reporters that the United States cannot allow the establishment of an independent government in South Korea without violating the Moscow Agreement. The next day, the director of the Soviet Embassy's press office told me that Koreans in the Soviet-occupied zone had been allowed to organize an independent government, with all key positions held by Koreans. According to a dispatch from Seoul on the 4th of this month, the former provisional government will be re-established regardless of whether the United States recognizes it, while the United States claims that it will never allow its establishment. Therefore, a conflict is likely to occur in Korea within 48 hours. Syngman Rhee has considered this in detail. Rhee knows that the tense situation at that time will inevitably lead to an incident one day. Therefore, he resolutely telegraphed Kim Koo, asking him not to take any action before Rhee's return to Korea. Rhee is now ready to return to the country to lead the Koreans. Therefore, the "keys to war and peace are actually in the hands of the State Department and the War Department."</p>
<h3>New Invention in the Shipping Industry Can Prevent Ships from Sinking</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 8th] A young man from Naples, Nappi, has successfully improved a German invention that can prevent ships from sinking. According to Nappi himself in an article in "The Voice," two German scientists previously invented a gas that, when attached to the stern of a ship, could prevent it from sinking because it is lighter than water. While detained in a German concentration camp, I heard about this new invention and have now installed an device that can produce the above-mentioned gas from a mixture of uranium ore, making it magnetic and tightly adhere to the stern of the ship, preventing the hull from sinking. This device can be installed on any ship.</p>
<h3>Supreme Soviet Delegation Arrives in Britain; Heavy Snow Hinders Activities</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] A delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has arrived in Britain for a visit, consisting of 20 representatives, including two women. During their stay here, they will attend several sessions of the House of Commons. As for other plans, they have not yet been decided, as the British side wants the Soviet delegation to decide their own schedule. The Soviet delegation includes a doctor, a scientist, a writer, a miner, an electrician, and a poet, so the areas of interest are very broad. As of now, due to heavy snow and traffic difficulties, the Soviet delegation has not yet had any activities.</p>
<h3>Jewish Terrorists Attack British Barracks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 8th] Jewish terrorists today attacked the British barracks in Tel Aviv and the Citrus Building, where the British military headquarters is located, clashing with guards for 75 minutes. The city was ablaze with fire, and explosions could be heard miles away. Two military vehicles in front of the Citrus Building were destroyed by bombs. At the same time, the police station in Haifa port was also attacked, resulting in a major fire.</p>
<h3>Palestine Question to Be Discussed by Britain Alone</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 8th, United Press] The United Nations has returned the Palestine question directly to Britain for its own discussion. The Security Council is scheduled to resume discussion on the U.S. trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands on the 12th and will debate the original eleven trusteeship questions again on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Kingdom in Southwest Asia; Serious Situation in Yemen; Old King Seriously Ill and Dying, Princes Brewing Internal Strife</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Correspondent Wang Gong, Angola, 7th Dispatch] The oldest and most powerful autocrat in the world today is now critically ill or about to die, leaving behind several wives and children vying for the succession to this secret kingdom. This autocrat is King Yahya of Yemen. He currently rules this 20th-century Arabian Nights-style country, which borders the British protectorate of Aden, a strategic location for defending the southern entrance to the Red Sea. The King of Yemen and his subjects not only know nothing about the Sino-Japanese War, but even the State Department in Washington and the Foreign Office in London know little about them. A small number of people who are interested in the country have some knowledge of Yahya and his subjects.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Yemen is about the size of our Taiwan Province, and its population is smaller than that of Shanghai. King Yahya has not clearly demarcated the borders of his country to the north and south. It borders Aden to the south and Saudi Arabia to the north. The King is 84 years old this year, and his autocratic power is even greater than that of Mussolini and Hitler. From national affairs to trivial matters such as travel and passport visas in his kingdom and the management of foreigners, he handles them all personally. In other words, the scope of his autocratic power is such that he has become the passport and visa officer of his mysterious kingdom.</p>
<p>Angola learned of the recent political crisis in the Kingdom of Yemen from the eighth prince of the King, who fled to Aden the day before yesterday and telegraphed the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo, stating: "The situation in Yemen is serious," and urging Arab countries to take "urgent and effective measures to stop the bloody tragedy of the people of my poor motherland." The eighth prince is now under British protection. He has received a modern education and is progressive in his thinking. He opposes the royal guard and the King's wives and concubines, because once the old King dies, they all want to maintain their traditional autocratic feudal dictatorship. This internal strife in the royal family has a considerable impact on the world's strategic situation.</p>
<p>It is reported that Britain signed a treaty with Yemen in 1934, followed by other Arab countries. The United States did not have treaty relations with it until 1946, while our country has never heard of the Kingdom of Yemen, let alone diplomatic relations. The 84-year-old King of Yemen is conservative in his thinking. He believes that the United Nations is just child's play, so he has not requested to join. However, the Kingdom of Yemen is one of the main countries of the Arab League, which was established in March 1945.</p>
<p>Although Yemen is small in size, its people are extremely patriotic. King Yahya considers the British dependency of Aden as his lost territory and repeatedly waged wars with Britain between World War I and World War II in an attempt to recover it, but was ultimately defeated by the British Air Force. Yahya has repeatedly clashed with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, his northern neighbor. In 1935, the King of Saudi Arabia sent troops to occupy all of Yemen, withdrawing only when King Yahya recognized the King of Saudi Arabia as the "Powerful King." In 1946, Yemen signed a treaty with the United States, ceding oil fields to the United States. Therefore, political turmoil within Yemen is inevitable after the old King's death.</p>
<p>There are currently two possible crises: first, the King of Saudi Arabia, a friend of the United States, may take advantage of the recent mourning to occupy the entire territory; second, the eighth prince may obtain the support of Britain and the United States to realize his ideal of modernizing this mysterious Red Sea country and clash with his family. Although the Kingdom of Yemen is far from our country, we should recognize the storm that is about to come in this southwest corner of Asia.</p>
<h3>The U.S. May Provide Economic Aid to Greece and Hungary; President to Discuss with Congressional Leaders Today</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] Political figures today emphasized that President Truman has apparently decided to ask Congress to approve aid to Greece and financial aid to Britain to enable it to maintain its troops in Greece. These figures stated that President Truman's decision to postpone his inspection of the West Indies on the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in order to study the situation in Greece is of great significance. At the same time, Britain has also stated that it has no intention of immediately withdrawing its troops from Greece. President Truman is scheduled to hold a meeting with leaders of both major parties in Congress on the 10th, at which time the President will not only explain the U.S.'s attitude toward Greece but will also clarify its general attitude toward the Near East.</p>
<p>Political and diplomatic figures believe that although there will be considerable opposition in Congress, the government's request will still be accepted. The U.S. government only needs to require Greece to establish a government with a majority of liberals and the U.S. to retain control over its loans, and the criticisms in Congress will naturally subside. As for Britain's appeal to Washington, it has aroused considerable speculation here. In the past, the United States believed that Britain, surrounded by international difficulties in the Mediterranean and the Near East, was better equipped to solve problems than the United States due to its experience, resourcefulness, and the organization of its naval bases. The United States now recognizes that Britain has not recovered its pre-war status, and the United States has a heavy responsibility. In view of the increasing opposition from the Soviet Union, the United States has decided to assume this responsibility. Not only that, but the U.S. Congress may also provide significant assistance to another European country, namely Hungary, which is not impossible. The opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Hungary has become apparent. One example is that the U.S. State Department protested on the 6th of this month against the arrest of former Secretary Kovács of the Hungarian Smallholders Party by the Soviet authorities in Hungary. The United States believes that this is tantamount to interfering in Hungary's internal affairs and violates the Yalta Agreement. Regarding this matter, the Soviet Union has issued a strongly worded reply, refuting the U.S.'s accusations.</p>
<p>British Ambassador to the U.S. Meets with Acheson</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] U.S. Undersecretary of State Acheson held talks with British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Inverchapel, this morning to discuss matters. According to well-informed sources, the topic of discussion was probably the Greek question, but Lord Inverchapel himself declined to make any statement. It is believed that Acheson's meeting with Lord Inverchapel is related to preparations for secret meetings held by the White House and the State Department.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 8th] The "New York World-Telegram" today published a full-page advertisement from the "American Democratic Greek Committee" opposing U.S. intervention in Greece and supporting British aggression against Greece. The "New York Sun" also hopes that the government will seriously consider before deciding to aid Greece.</p>
<h3>British Air Force Stationed in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 8th] The British Air Ministry has allocated the 209th Squadron to be stationed in Hong Kong, naming it the 209th Hong Kong Squadron.</p>
<h3>Dutch Release U.S. Merchant Ship After Unloading</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 8th] The U.S. ship "Pelham," which was detained by the Dutch Navy, has been released by the Dutch side after the U.S. government lodged a protest with the Netherlands. However, according to those in charge here, the Dutch government has no intention of abandoning its control over export trade to Java and Sumatra at present.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 8th] The Dutch port authorities today began unloading $3 million worth of rubber and quinine from the U.S. merchant ship "Pelham," which was detained last Friday. However, because the American sailors on the ship refused to cooperate, the hatches were opened in two places under armed guard, and the cargo was unloaded into the Tanjung Priok harbor dock using cranes.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb Manufacturing; Patents Cannot Be Permanently Protected; Power of Cosmic Rays Even More Astonishing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] London, 9th Broadcast: Famous mathematician Lewis said: The U.S. monopoly on the atomic bomb definitely cannot be maintained for five years. It is said that within five years, any non-industrial country can manufacture atomic bombs as long as they have uranium production.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] According to the famous atomic physicist, Dr. Swann, who delivered a speech at the National Geographic Society here last night, the energy emitted by cosmic rays is at least 10,000 times stronger than that of atomic bombs. Under certain circumstances, it is 100 billion times stronger. However, these cosmic rays have not yet been controlled, and the source of cosmic rays outside the Earth's atmosphere is still unknown. Dr. Swann is the director of the Bartol Research Foundation and participated in the B-29 experimental flight laboratory tests last summer, with many findings.</p>
<h3>Indian Congress Party Appeals to Muslim League to Cooperate in Eliminating Ethnic Disputes</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New Delhi, 8th] The Indian Congress Party today appealed to the Muslim League to establish peace between the two ethnic groups in India and end the recent riots in Punjab. The Congress Party Executive Committee also requested the Muslim League to elect representatives for a peace conference to help eliminate disputes between the two religions and reach an agreement before Britain withdraws from India. The Executive Committee has also resolved to propose to the Muslim League to divide Punjab into Indian and Muslim zones. This proposal is intended as a slight concession from the Congress Party to the Muslim League. The Muslim League has not yet responded quickly to this, but it is believed that senior leaders of the League will accept the Congress Party's request. The Executive Committee also appealed to all ethnic groups and political parties in India to stop all conflicts and riots.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 8th] The Congress Party Executive Committee today decided to welcome the British government's statement on the date of withdrawal from India and invited representatives of the Muslim League to hold a meeting with representatives of the Congress Party to discuss issues related to the future Indian constitution.</p>
<p>Conflict Does Not Stop, Gandhi Willing to Die</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 9th] It is learned that if Hindus and Muslims in Punjab cannot restore their fraternal relationship, Mahatma Gandhi intends to fast to death. Gandhi once said that he would rather die than witness Indians and Muslims slaughtering each other on the eve of India's complete freedom. Following the recent massacre in Bengal, serious chaos broke out in Punjab.</p>

<h3>Rumors That the Moscow Conference Will Discuss the China Question; The City Council Telegraphed the Whole Country Urging the Central Government to Negotiate and Oppose Interference; Chinese Affairs Are Not to Be Interfered with by Other Countries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to oppose the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference discussing the China question, yesterday specially telegraphed the councils of provinces and cities across the country, stating: "To the councils of all provinces and cities across the country: It has been found that our country has relied on the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang and the arduous struggle of the military and civilians across the country for eight years of the War of Resistance, defeating the enemy and finally winning victory. We are at a time of striving to govern and complete the great cause of national construction, but the Chinese Communist Party deliberately incites war and obstructs the progress of national policy. Although Marshal Marshall has made painstaking efforts to mediate and coordinate, the government has shown magnanimity and made concessions, but due to the stubbornness of the Communist Party, the peace talks have failed to achieve success, which is regrettable. Fortunately, our government is responding to the difficult times, only hoping to advance to constitutionalism, and is still following the established policy, responding to the people's demands, convening the National Assembly, and completing the constitutional work. On the one hand, it is striving to quell the rebellion, restore transportation, and promote unification, so as to stabilize society and increase production. On the other hand, it is expanding the foundation of the government and extensively inviting talents from across the country to participate, so as to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism. All of this is the goal of our government's efforts and what we hope for. However, it has recently been rumored that the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has proposed to discuss the China question. And the Chinese Communist Party and its followers are even dreaming of welcoming international interference, which is truly strange. Chinese affairs, the Chinese people have the right to decide for themselves, not to be interfered with by other countries. The secret agreement of the Yalta Conference is still deeply painful. No matter what international conference, if China does not participate, it must absolutely not be allowed to discuss the China question. If there is a unilateral resolution, no matter where it comes from, China will not be bound by it in the slightest. Our government should also clearly announce its attitude to prevent international conspiracies. Therefore, the first session of the second general assembly of this council decided that since there are rumors outside, the central government should be urged to negotiate quickly and oppose the Moscow Conference discussing the China question. In addition to requesting the National Government to adopt this proposal, we are sending this telegram for your reference, and hope that your council will unanimously advocate for it. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Council, Yin Jia Yin."</p>
<h3>Zhu Shiming Returned Home to Report on His Duties and Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Aboard a U.S. Military Ship</h3>
<p>General Zhu Shiming, head of our delegation to Japan, returned home on the morning of the 7th aboard the U.S. military ship "General Hughes" with one staff officer. He arrived at the Hongkou Wharf at 4 p.m. yesterday. The U.S. ship treated Zhu with VIP courtesy and hoisted Zhu's star flag high on the mast.

<h3>An Italian Ship Arrives in Shanghai to Carry Overseas Chinese Back to Italy</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Italian ship "Scstriere" arrived on the 7th, represented by Richang Company, to carry Italian overseas Chinese back to Italy. It was originally planned to sail to Tianjin the day before yesterday to carry overseas Chinese from North China, but it failed to set sail because it did not obtain permission from our government. The Italian flag on the ship has been changed in style, so some mistakenly thought it was French. According to Richang Company, the agent, the ship came to Shanghai empty and does not intend to load any goods except for carrying overseas Chinese back to Italy. The rumor that it will load 4,000 pieces of soybeans to Italy is not true.</p>
<h3>Reporting Profit Tax Unable to Complete the Form as Scheduled; Rubber and Other Industries Will Petition This Morning</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] Fifty-eight units of the Rubber, Hardware, Department Store, and other industry associations in this city held a joint meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 4 p.m. yesterday regarding the matter of the Direct Taxation Bureau's deadline for reporting profit tax. All those present felt that the Direct Taxation Bureau's deadline for reporting the 36th year's profit-seeking enterprise income tax before March 15th of this year was too tight. The industry associations were also unable to complete the form within the deadline for all the reporting procedures. It was decided to go to the Direct Taxation Bureau collectively to petition at 9 a.m. today. Zhao Xianji, Hong Nianzu, Ba Lingyun, Wang Jingdong, Cai Hezhang, and others were appointed as spokespersons.

<h3>Gao Shiyu Returns from Inspection Tour: Discusses the General Situation of European and American Textile Industries, Encourages Research and Production, and Emphasizes the Urgent Need to Improve and Strengthen the Export of Chinese Raw Silk</h3>
<p>Gao Shiyu, a Bachelor of Science in Textile Dyeing from the United Kingdom, who taught at the Central Vocational School and concurrently served as the General Manager of the Chongqing Leshan Minzhi Textile Dyeing Company, went to Europe and the United States last April to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the post-war textile industry. Mr. Gao returned to Shanghai on the 7th aboard the McKinley Nasu, and a reporter visited Mr. Gao at his residence yesterday to inquire about his experiences and impressions of the trip.</p>
<p>Intensified Production of Artificial Wool</p>
<p>Mr. Gao first stated: "The United Kingdom is a leading country in the wool textile industry. After the war, it urgently sought to restore its previous production volume, but it has not been able to achieve this in the short term. The reason is the lack of manpower, as those distributed in various occupied areas have not been fully repatriated. Although the wool textile industry has not yet achieved greater expansion, the entire industry has indeed entered a new trend. The British are now working hard to research artificial fibers and using peanut kernels as raw materials to manufacture artificial wool. In terms of improving artificial fibers, they are striving to strengthen the raw materials, absorb water pores, and make them more comfortable than transparent colloid silk, and the selling price is low. This type of fiber can also be used as a substitute for wool. Past products were once suspended due to the war. It is expected that the British artificial wool production will be intensified next year.</p>
<p>Strikes are Extremely Rare</p>
<p>Regarding management and sales, strikes are extremely rare in the UK due to traditional habits. Moreover, the social welfare organization is very thorough. Workers earning less than 250 pounds per year are required to have social insurance, and they have considerable protection in case of death or illness, so their lives can be stable. The sales targets are: (1) colonies, (2) Europe, (3) South America, (4) the Far East, and (5) the home country. In terms of profit, South America is better than Europe, but due to environmental factors, they would rather choose Europe than South America. The UK is an island country, and agricultural products are inherently insufficient. The island nation tightens its belt, strengthens exports, and exchanges for foreign exchange. Meat, eggs, and other foods are all subject to control. Currently, Canada's construction is progressing rapidly, especially in Ottawa. However, due to the vast land and sparse population, the future development is unlimited. The main product is the utilization of forests to manufacture pulp. In addition to half being used as raw materials for papermaking, the rest will be supplied for the manufacture of rayon. Currently, the supply of this item is largely above Sweden.</p>
<p>American Cotton Production is Extremely Large</p>
<p>After the war, the textile industry in the United States was extremely prosperous, and cotton production was particularly large. The government, with foresight, encouraged farmers to produce, and pre-determined a limited price for the products. If the price falls below the limited price, the government will buy them all. The improvement of animal husbandry has been effective, and the products can rival those of Australia, but the quantity is still insufficient. Artificial fiber achievements are the best, entirely manufactured by synthetic methods, using coal as the main starting point to become elastic nylon fiber. The most advanced one is almost equal to real silk, and it is divided into continuous and high-strength cotton fibers. Its cost can be one to two times lower than real silk, and its durability is more than dozens of times higher. The only drawback is that it is not as warm as real silk.</p>
<p>The United States is Willing to Assist in Our Construction</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Gao reiterated that raw silk is our country's main export, and it should be improved. However, at a time when the world is competing to promote artificial silk and artificial wool, we should also catch up quickly and not ignore it. Regarding management, Mr. Gao said: "Although there are occasional labor disputes in the United States, the disputes are not serious. The key to the knot is: (1) the treatment is not as good as during the war, causing dissatisfaction, and (2) some people with slight savings temporarily live a leisurely life, and then work again after their savings are exhausted. As a result, both labor and management suffer greatly during the strike period, and the profit-makers are the general stores, taking the opportunity to raise prices. The sales method is the opposite of the United Kingdom, with supplying the home country as the first priority, and the surplus is developed overseas. The United States is very interested in our country's industrial construction and is very willing to assist from the sidelines, because if China's industrial construction is successful, the United States' commercial position in the Far East can be permanently based on this. As for our country's recent economic measures to change the exchange rate, according to the views of general American economists, it is believed that China is encouraging exports in exchange for foreign exchange. In the future, if foreign exchange increases, American goods can be exported continuously, which is more flexible and fluid than exhausting foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor Practices Boxing: Ding Tongjun Offers Free Instruction</h3>
<p>Huang Liang, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, recently encouraged his colleagues, saying: "Boxing can strengthen the body. I hope everyone can use their spare time to practice with Prosecutor Ding Tongjun."</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Ding has extensive research on boxing. He now offers free instruction to his colleagues every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. It is reported that thirteen male and female judges have voluntarily signed up to participate.</p>
<h3>Seeking to Reduce International Telegraph Fees and Open Direct Wireless Circuits</h3>
<p>The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, under orders, will change the news telegram fees sent to European and American countries, which are valued in US dollars converted into national currency, from the 10th. According to the exchange rate of the US dollar of the Central Bank, each US dollar is calculated at 12,000 yuan in national currency. At the same time, the exchange rate of the gold franc to the national currency is also changed to 4,000 yuan in national currency for each gold franc. According to the person in charge of the station, in order to reduce the price of international telegrams, the station has repeatedly tried to open more direct international wireless circuits. The recently opened direct circuit includes the Central Java International Wireless Circuit between Shanghai and Obadavia. In addition, the direct circuit between China and South America is currently under test. Once the formal direct report is opened, the quotations from China to South America will also be greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse Found on Jiaotong Road Identified as Vegetable Vendor Murdered</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A male corpse was found in a small stream near Wangjiajing on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The corpse had been strangled and had knife wounds on the head and body. According to police investigations, the deceased was named Hou Adi, 22 years old. The day before yesterday, he rode a bicycle carrying two baskets of leeks, apparently intending to sell them in Shanghai. When passing by the area, he was intercepted by several Hakka vegetable vendors who tried to buy them at a low price. A verbal dispute occurred, resulting in him being beaten to the ground and eventually murdered. Afterwards, the police station in charge sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and issue an arrest warrant for the perpetrators to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Scalped Tickets and Clearing Out Ticket Touts: Meeting Convened with Cinema Representatives to Discuss Five Elimination Methods</h3>
<p>The activities of "flying ticket gangs" (i.e., ticket scalpers) selling black market movie tickets in major cinemas in the city are extremely rampant. In order to thoroughly eliminate them, the Municipal Police Bureau convened the persons in charge of the city's fourteen first-run cinemas, ticket sellers, etc., at 3:00 PM yesterday to jointly discuss effective elimination methods, and decided on: (1) The Municipal Police Bureau will order the volunteer police brigade to continue to strictly eliminate them and severely punish the captured ticket scalpers, and send their leaders to the Caohejing reception center. (2) The Municipal Police Bureau will clearly order all cinemas that both parties involved in black market ticket sales will be treated as violating police regulations. (3) Strictly investigate and deal with cinema employees who collude with ticket scalpers. (4) Strictly investigate and deal with local branch police officers who accept bribes and protect ticket scalpers. (5) Each cinema will designate two liaison officers to contact the Municipal Police Bureau, provide information, and assist police officers in the elimination work.</p>
<h3>Public Training Alumni Congress: Spirit Unfading from the Past Years, 4,200 Members Inspected, Silk Banner Presented to Commander Xuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Public Training Alumni Association held a member congress at the racetrack yesterday morning and was inspected by the commander. A total of 4,225 public training alumni attended, and guests included Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Municipal Party Committee Chairman Fang Zhi, Garrison Commander Fu Zhengmo, Garrison Headquarters Commander Xuan Yuewu, and former Public Training Office Director Li Xiangqi, Deputy Director Jiang Huaisu, and Chief Captain Tao Yishan. After the flag-raising ceremony, the congress chairman Li Xiangqi gave a speech, stating: "Public training has been going on for ten years. During the Anti-Japanese War, public training students assisted in the Anti-Japanese War and established meritorious service. Ten years later, today, we can hold a member congress here, and so many students have attended with such enthusiasm, and the spirit is not fading from the past years, which is something to be proud of. In the future, we should work hard to encourage ourselves and complete the mission of nation-building." Then, Chairman Fang gave a speech, saying that the students must have infinite feelings in their hearts that they can hold a congress in the racetrack today. Speaker Pan said in his speech: "When public training began ten years ago, I was working in the municipal government. At that time, we were preparing for the Anti-Japanese War. Although the Anti-Japanese War has been completed, the north of the Yangtze River and the south of the Yellow River are still in turmoil, and Shanghai can still be as peaceful as usual, which is due to the security of the local area. I hope that the students will be the vanguard of the people, assist the authorities in maintaining law and order, maintain social peace, and work hard for nation-building." Commander Xuan and Public Training Alumni Association Chairman Tao Yishan also delivered speeches one after another. The public training students unanimously elected Wang Xiaolai to give a reply. The inspection began at half-past nine. Although the weather was cold yesterday morning, the public training students all marched forward with neat steps and without hesitation. After the inspection, the Student Union's representative presented a silk banner with the words "Screen of Songhu" to Commander Xuan. The ceremony ended at ten o'clock.</p>

<h3>Seven Robbers with Six Guns Rob a Resident in the Early Morning</h3>
<p>At 6:30 yesterday morning, No. 481 Gaoyang Road was suddenly robbed. The bandits acted quickly. The entire case is currently under investigation by the Tilanqiao Police Station. The gang of seven robbers, armed with six handguns, broke into the victim's inner room at the above time, threatened the victim, and immediately searched the premises. They also searched through the pockets of the men and women, and robbed them of clothes, jewelry, a bicycle, and nearly one million yuan in cash. The seven robbers spoke with a Jiangbei accent. At about 8:00, they tied up the victim couple and escaped from the front door.</p>
<h3>Amputated Fingers of Abandoned Baby Found Beside Trash Can</h3>
<p>Beside a trash can in the Tianbaoli North Alley of Xinjiang Road, yesterday morning at about 11 o'clock, someone found an abandoned baby girl about two years old. Upon closer inspection, bloodstains were evident on her left hand, and two fingers had been chopped off. Onlookers were discussing the matter, some saying it was the harm of a stepmother, others saying it was an illegitimate child. After being sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for examination, it was determined that the baby was suffering from tuberculous meningitis. She died at 4:00 PM. The North Railway Station Police Station learned of this and sent Inspector Liu Zichang to investigate. It was learned that the baby's fingers were injured by a sharp instrument. It is speculated that it was an old superstitious belief that the fingers of a sick baby were cut off to prevent them from coming back to demand debts next time.</p>
<h3>Dai Cuilun Takes Over the Symphony Orchestra: Takes on a New Mission of Art, Plans to Perform Once Every Half Month with Extremely Low Ticket Prices, Uses Opera to Obtain Universal Educational Significance</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by This Newspaper] The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, with a history of more than 60 years, has a deep impression in people's minds. The orchestra often had grand performances before the war. Even last year, after the municipal government took it over from the enemy and puppet regime during the victory, it often had public performances. Due to budget constraints and personnel changes, the orchestra has temporarily suspended rehearsal and performance activities for the past two months.</p>
<p>The orchestra not only has a long and glorious history, but it is also the only and most large-scale orchestra in the Far East. During the era of the Municipal Council, it was its most prosperous period. Many international orchestra masters came to Shanghai in an endless stream to participate in the orchestra's performances. The regret is that because its standards for admission were very high, only a few Chinese people were able to be selected into the orchestra for decades. Looking at it as an object for the idle to spend time, we will not talk about its expensive ticket prices and the style of losing educational significance in the past. If we say that it is a universal agency for proper music education and training of Chinese orchestral talents, anyone who has a knowledge of music and art and loves it should agree to make it continue to exist and give it utmost support to promote and develop it.</p>
<p>He Did Not Refuse the Arduous Task</p>
<p>Mayor Wu attaches great importance to this point. Therefore, even under the circumstances that the municipal financial resources are extremely tight today, he is still determined to take out 30 million yuan per month to maintain the existence of the orchestra, and has entrusted Dai Cuilun (see photo), president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, to serve as the new director of the orchestra. This means that the orchestra has shouldered a new mission of art education from now on.</p>
<p>Cuilun was one of the few Chinese people who participated in the orchestra's performances in the past. He is particularly familiar with its past, especially the personnel relations in the orchestra. Mayor Wu sincerely invited him to help out this time, even though he himself was already overwhelmed by the affairs of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and his family did not want him to add to his excessive hard work. However, he knew that if the orchestra unfortunately collapsed, it would take at least another twenty years to establish a symphony orchestra like this in China. Because the orchestra's instruments and talents are rare even internationally, especially in terms of sheet music, many valuable famous pieces are now out of print.</p>
<p>Performance Income Used as a Fund</p>
<p>For this simple belief, he resolutely agreed to Mayor Wu's commission and took over for six months. He decided to take over today.</p>
<p>In a delicate building close to the street, the reporter heard a detailed description of the orchestra's past and targeted the past problems. He said: "After taking over in the future, the first thing to do is to enable the orchestra's musicians to obtain a reasonable and stable life. In this regard, he has already obtained the mayor's approval to give 30 million yuan per month. In the future, all performance income will be used as the orchestra's fund. He plans to perform once every half month in the future and set the ticket price extremely low so that general students and citizens have the opportunity to listen to the performances. In order to welcome international guests and special performances, the ticket price may be set a little higher. Based on his past experience in Chongqing, he also plans to use the opera method to follow the universal educational significance. In order to enable the performance to achieve the expected results, he will require that every musician can abide by the necessary discipline when practicing four times a week.</p>
<p>Starting next month, we will hear the orchestra's performance again. Wait, this is a new sound!</p>
<h3>Fire in Pig Farm in Beixinjing, Carelessness in Brick Shop on Xizang Road</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A fire broke out at the Xiexing Pig Farm on Xihu Road, Beixinjing Town, around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Thick smoke billowed up, but fortunately, workers from the nearby shipyard bravely came to the rescue and put out the fire. A total of two bungalows were burned down. The Xinjing Branch Bureau investigated the truth of the fire and learned that it was caused by a neighboring firecracker workshop trying out firecrackers, and sparks fell on the reed mat shed of the pig farm. The owner of the workshop was immediately detained by the branch bureau for handling.</p>
<p>Due to carelessness, a fire broke out on the third floor of Dafeng Brick and Tile Shop, No. 78 Xizang South Road (opposite the former Second District Police Station), at around 10:20 yesterday morning. Because the wind was very strong, the flames spread in all directions, and immediately spread to the third floor of the neighboring Xingmao Sugar Shop, No. 79, and the residents of No. 80. After the Songshan District and other fire departments dispatched vehicles to rescue, the fire was extinguished around noon, and the loss was still slight.</p>

<h3>Zhongde Hospital Expands Free Delivery</h3>
<p>The Zhongde Hospital at No. 457 Zhongzheng Middle Road in the city was founded by Mr. Yu Songjun and has been in existence for 25 years since its establishment.

Now, the scope of services has been expanded, and all poor women in the city can obtain delivery coupons from the hospital, and can request out-of-hospital delivery or in-hospital childbirth with the coupon, and no fees will be charged. At the same time, the hospital does not charge any fees for prenatal examination and postpartum visits for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Truck Kills Woman</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] At 1:30 yesterday afternoon, a ten-wheeled truck sped through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, killing a woman, Li Zhou (23 years old). Officer No. 1037 discovered this and ordered the truck to stop, but the truck ignored the order and tried to escape from west to east. The officer then jumped onto the Jeep card No. 18947 of the Good Rescue Headquarters and bravely chased after it. When the car arrived at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road, the red light was on, so it was blocked. The officer hurriedly jumped down, intending to detain the driver and bring him to the bureau, but he tripped and fell to the ground, injuring his right knee, and blood flowed like a torrent. The Huangpu Branch Bureau sent the injured police officer to the hospital for treatment, but the ten-wheeled truck that caused the accident was still not apprehended and is under investigation.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Sixtieth Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>On March 9th, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, it was the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Wu Tiecheng of Zhongshan. Nearly a thousand of his former and current subordinates, deeply grateful for his past favors, wished to offer words of congratulation before the formal toast. However, they worried about the order of precedence in serving Mr. Wu and the potential for discrepancies in their duties, making it difficult to ensure a smooth and comprehensive celebration. Therefore, they appointed Mr. Pan Gongzhan as the mediator to explain the matter in detail to Zhao, and asked Zhao to write something for the occasion. Zhao thought that offering words of praise to a person celebrating their longevity was a private matter, and that writing on behalf of others would lack sincerity. Thus, he hesitated to accept. Mr. Pan said, "Mr. Wu is a man of the world, and also your friend. You should express your sincere thoughts freely and without reservation." Zhao agreed.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was a founding contributor to the revolutionary party. Let us first examine his role in the history of the revolutionary party. When the Tongmenghui (United League) was first established, a concern was raised among comrades: if the revolution focused solely on destruction and all talent was poured into it, scholarship would inevitably suffer. In the future, when construction was needed, there might be a shortage of skilled individuals. Therefore, some advocated dividing talent into two groups: one dedicated to implementing the revolution and the other dedicated to scholarship. At that time, Zhao had failed and fled to Japan after the Liuyang and Liling uprising. Believing that direct confrontation was not his forte, he requested to study in England to await the opportune moment. However, his resolve proved weak, and he achieved little in his studies. He did not participate in the crucial stages of the revolution, falling far behind his comrades. Those comrades, on the other hand, focused their efforts and did not delve deeply into scholarly pursuits. In the early years of the Republic, when laws were being discussed and governance was being established, they inevitably struggled to cope, revealing their shortcomings. They had not anticipated the emergence of outstanding talents from within the country, like Mr. Wu. Born with the refined qualities of Guangdong in the bustling city of Jiujiang, he studied classical texts in his youth and became well-versed in worldly affairs as he grew older. Sharing similar aspirations and engaging in harmonious correspondence with the late Chairman Lin Gongzi Chao, he openly pursued diplomatic strategies and secretly cultivated virtuous and heroic individuals. In the years leading up to the Xinhai Revolution, along the Yangtze River, he had already established a network of unwavering enemies against the Manchurian government. All of this was a natural convergence inspired by Mr. Wu's admiration for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's brilliance. Upon receiving the orders of the Tongmenghui, he carried them out with utmost diligence. When the Wuchang Uprising broke out, Jiujiang responded even before Shanghai. As is the constant principle of physics, things with real substance have louder voices, so this was no wonder. At that time, Mr. Wu was just over twenty years old, exuding youthful vigor and determined to bring clarity to the world. Although he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the military government and as the representative of Jiangxi Province at the constitutional conference in Beijing, personally participating in the election of the provisional president, he recognized the treacherous ministers who were betraying the country. As the situation had been revealed, Dr. Sun Yat-sen humbly stepped down, and the efforts failed. Mr. Wu was particularly displeased. After the defeat of the Gui-Chou Rebellion, comrades fled and went into hiding, knowing that it was temporarily impossible to contend with the treacherous. He followed the principle of nurturing strength in obscurity and dedicated himself to learning. He acquired expertise in both political and economic sciences, drawing upon the best of them and applying them broadly. This was during his time at Meiji University in Japan. Soon after, he went to America, making the overthrow of Yuan Shikai his mission. He studied diligently day and night, further advancing his knowledge. Before long, Dr. Sun Yat-sen established his headquarters in Guangzhou as the Grand Marshal, and summoned Mr. Wu to serve as his aide. He was soon promoted to Chief Aide of the Grand Marshal's headquarters. Not long after that, he was appointed Director of the Provincial Police Department and concurrently served as the Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau. Criminals and bandits were immediately subdued, and the prevalence of theft declined. From this point on, Mr. Wu's ability to manage complex situations began to manifest itself. Moreover, Guangdong, a new revolutionary base, and the Pinglin area, were fiercely contested by both sides. Internal treachery was brewing, and mercenary armies were rampant. For several years, the Grand Marshal relied on Mr. Wu as his right-hand man to carefully consider and respond to situations, commanding with composure. It is impossible to know the extent to which the chaos would have escalated if it were not for him. Among these events, Chen Jiongming's rebellion was an unprecedented act of treason, making suppression extremely difficult. When Mr. Wu accompanied the Grand Marshal on the Northern Expedition as the commander of the guard army, the army was stationed in Shaoguan. Suddenly, the Guangzhou merchant corps, instigated by foreign lackeys, colluded with bandits and launched a major rebellion. The Grand Marshal solely entrusted Mr. Wu with a handwritten order to immediately return and quell the rebellion. Mr. Wu acted swiftly, traveling day and night without delay. He led several thousand troops and arrived in Guangzhou overnight, employing both appeasement and suppression, and the rebellion was quickly subdued. This exemplifies Mr. Wu's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and make decisive judgments in times of crisis. In 1924, the Kuomintang was reorganized. Mr. Wu was ordered to work with comrades such as Liao Zhongkai and Sun Ke to plan and implement a completely new structure. Mr. Wu was appointed as a temporary central committee member, served as the acting garrison commander of Guangzhou, and concurrently served as an executive committee member of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Headquarters, as well as the minister of labor and propaganda departments. He combined party, government, and military powers in his hands, expanding and promoting them with ease. Mr. Wu's grand plans and great strategies were once again demonstrated. After the success of the Northern Expedition, talented individuals emerged like clouds, and Mr. Wu was increasingly relied upon. He shouldered important responsibilities one after another. In 1928, he was ordered to comfort the Northeast Army. The frontier regions were bitterly cold, with temperatures plummeting to 35 degrees below zero. Yet, Mr. Wu wholeheartedly followed his duties, filled with joy, traveling between Qiqihar, Zhalantun, and Boketu, where the icy and snowy lands asked for his service, the different ethnicities lived in harmony, as if he was simply doing something simple, as if he were traveling to the moon; at that time, Liaoning and Shenyang had only recently been placed under national authority, and the people were still discontented. The politicians and scholars in the north, such as Gu Shaochuan and Luo Junren, were difficult to gather from afar. Zhao also loitered at the Beiling Academy as a teacher, and the cause of unification seemed to hang by a thread. As a senior official from the central government, Mr. Wu planned strategies in the background, closely advised the headquarters, openly engaged with various officials, and every smile and frown carried great significance. During gatherings, he consistently demonstrated brilliance. For two or three years, the nation had no worries about the northeast, and people at home and abroad shared a common hatred. Then came the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, marking the prelude to the great war. Zhao knew Mr. Wu's ability and purpose. Zhao knew Mr. Wu's mind was on the nation. Sincerity breeds clarity, and clarity breeds sincerity, and Mr. Wu possessed both. Shanghai, a place where Chinese and foreigners mingled, was notoriously difficult to govern. Due to unequal treaties, it had become a virtual colony, and its customs differed greatly. Treacherous merchants and unruly people had formed a powerful force that was difficult to shake, hindering governance. As the mayor, Mr. Wu implemented reforms and improvements, striking a balance in his actions. The good people appreciated him, and even the bad people did not resent him. The songs praising him have continued to be sung to this day. What is truly worthy of admiration is that Mr. Wu had only been in office for a short time when the Hongqiao Incident occurred. He managed to pacify the military and the people, ensuring that supplies were not lacking, turning the initial battle against a powerful enemy in the southeast into a national glory. The amount of effort Mr. Wu expended cannot be fully measured. In the following five or six years, Mr. Wu managed Shanghai, planned the central district, mobilized manpower and resources, and directed them towards a single goal. Grand plans were initiated, and prosperity flourished. He foresaw that Shanghai would become the leading metropolis in East Asia, comparable to the ancient Lingtai. Then the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. In the early stages of the War of Resistance, Mr. Wu was transferred to govern Guangdong. With the reverence of a native, he served as a shelter for the people, emphasizing both expediency and principle, and implementing defense strategies. Zhao once wrote an evaluation of Mr. Wu, calling him the "Best Governor of Internal Defense". It was by no means an empty praise. However, the enemy's forces were fierce, and the coastal regions were in danger. The overall situation was such that it could not be resisted by the efforts of one person alone. Coincidentally, the central party governance was being reorganized, and there was a need for someone to manage it. Mr. Wu became the chief secretary of the central party headquarters. Skilled and familiar with the work, he demonstrated the style of Yang Shu's light chariot and simple belt, responding to emergencies with agility and adjusting policies as needed. Since the establishment of the party, he had been in charge of the central hub, harmonizing the members, explaining principles, and defining righteousness, ensuring clarity both at the center and on the borders. In that position, who other than Mr. Wu would be so trusted and respected? During this period, Mr. Wu was appointed to comfort overseas Chinese communities, visiting major ports such as Singapore, Penang, and the Dutch East Indies. He meticulously explained the central government's intentions, the leaders' anti-Japanese strategy, and the steps involved, like pouring refreshing nectar into the minds of every overseas Chinese citizen. As a result, the call to action spread like wildfire. People eagerly returned to the motherland to serve the country, and donations poured in, with everyone fearing they would be left behind. The nation sent an envoy to Southeast Asia to conduct propaganda work, which was unprecedented. The sincerity of Southeast Asia towards the nation, and the collection of donations, was on a scale never seen before. If it were not for Mr. Wu's efforts to organize and facilitate everything, how could such a result have been achieved? Alas. Mr. Wu has experienced both internal and external affairs, exhausting his energy and spirit. As he enters his sixtieth year, and with national affairs becoming even more critical, the nation relies on him even more. Mr. Wu writes and speaks tirelessly, using medicine as sustenance and working day and night, unable to find even a moment of leisure. A little over a week ago, he suffered from high blood pressure and sought medical treatment in Shanghai. Following the doctor's orders, he rested quietly for over ten days, not receiving guests. Zhao visited him frequently, and Mr. Wu said, "These past two weeks have been a haven for me in my dreams. In my life, I have never been away from my duties for so long." Zhao was deeply moved. Zhao and Mr. Wu differ in their academic backgrounds and political affiliations, but they have been friends for over thirty years. Their relationship is as pure as water between gentlemen. Even after many years of not seeing each other, they remain as close as if they had just met. They often engage in discussions, never letting personal matters interfere with public duties, nor vice versa. In Zhao's view, having always been fair to others, Mr. Wu does not neglect scholarship due to his work, nor does he neglect his duties due to leisure. He holds great ambitions and harmonizes principles and expediency. His conduct and interactions with others are all logical. Finding someone like him in this era is rare. He also devotes himself to the party and remains loyal to the nation. In the past, Zhao held the biased view that scholarship and career could not be pursued simultaneously. Now he sees that a wren cannot understand the vastness of the Kunpeng, and a carp in a puddle cannot comprehend the breadth of the ocean. If Su Shi were alive today and could meet Mr. Wu, in addition to admiring Han and Fan, he would surely say that he had seen all the wonders of the world and would have no regrets. Zhao shared this view with Mr. Pan, who in turn conveyed it to over a thousand comrades, who all agreed wholeheartedly. Zhao hopes that by expressing these sentiments before the audience during the celebration, he may earn a smile from Mr. Wu. This is the preface.</p>
<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Wu Travel to Zhenjiang for Birthday Celebration; Lively Celebrations at Shanghai Residence</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Yesterday was the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. Many people went to Mr. Wu's residence on Haig Road to offer their congratulations, including Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Councilor Pan, and hundreds of former subordinates.

<h3>Ministry of Education Formulates Five-Year Plan to Eliminate Illiteracy Nationwide; Budget for This Year is 52.5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] According to recent news released by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry is determined to eliminate illiteracy nationwide. It has formulated a five-year social education plan, which will be implemented starting this year. According to recent statistics, there are 150 million illiterate people nationwide. The plan aims to eliminate illiteracy among 30 million people each year for five years, using supplementary education and other methods. The budget for this year is 52.5 billion yuan, which is currently being reviewed by the Minister.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Recently Issues Order to Abolish Examination Method for Primary and Secondary School Grades</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The Ministry of Education has recently ordered the abolition of the method for examining the academic performance of students in secondary and primary schools by educational administrative agencies at all levels, which was established before the war, and has instructed the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to comply. It is reported that the reason for the abolition is that the Ministry of Education is simplifying regulations and gradually abolishing unnecessary rules and regulations, and this is not limited to this one method. As recent revisions to secondary school regulations already include provisions for examining student grades, and local educational administrative agencies have supervisors who inspect and examine schools, while schools have academic affairs departments that are responsible for examinations at all times, it is not necessary for everything to be stipulated by the central government, and local authorities should be responsible for handling these matters themselves.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Industrial College Preparatory Committee Schedules Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch] After the Anhui Provincial Industrial College was approved by the provincial government to be established by upgrading the Bengbu Advanced Industrial School, the provincial government immediately appointed twenty-three prominent figures from within and outside the province, including Chang Fanhou, Chen Yanfeng, Wu Jingqing, Wang Runqin, Ke Yufu, and Hang Liwu, as members of the preparatory committee to organize the preparatory committee. The chairman and vice-chairman of the committee are Ma Jingchang, a member of the Political Council, and Bi Zhonghan, the principal of the Advanced Industrial School. It is reported that Ma and Bi have drafted the various rules and regulations of the committee and the preparatory plan for the industrial college and have scheduled the first meeting of the preparatory committee for the fifteenth of this month at the committee's headquarters in Huangzhuang, Bengbu. The entire faculty and students of the Advanced Industrial School are preparing a warm welcome.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Closure of Two Shanghai Chinese Medicine Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Because the Shanghai Private New China Chinese Medicine Vocational School and the Shanghai Private Chinese Medicine Vocational School have advertised for enrollment without being registered, and after repeated investigations by the Ministry, the funds, operating expenses, equipment, facilities, curriculum, and teaching staff of the above two schools have all been found to be unsatisfactory, the Ministry of Education has sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau ordering the two schools to close.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Students in Japan Face Difficult Living Conditions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch of the 8th] Chinese students residing in Kyoto are currently experiencing difficult living conditions. Student representatives met with members of the Chinese press corps visiting Japan and explained everything. It is said that they rely solely on coarse rice and radishes for sustenance every day. Although they now receive a monthly supply of sugar, rice, wheat flour, potatoes, and cigarettes as citizens of Allied nations, they have no choice but to sell the sugar and cigarettes to make ends meet. According to student representatives, most students are extremely concerned about the domestic situation, but like other overseas Chinese in Japan, they ultimately lack accurate reporting on the domestic situation and cannot gain a clear understanding of the situation in their home country.</p>
<h3>Journalism Program at Law School Establishes Journalism Lecture Series</h3>
<p>The journalism program at the Shanghai Law School was established in Wanxian during the war and has been in existence for five years, with nearly 200 graduates, most of whom are serving in the provinces and cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Sichuan, and Kang. The program was relocated to Shanghai last spring after the recovery and currently has four classes.

<p>National Education Advancement Association Holds Second General Membership Meeting Yesterday; More Than 3,000 People Attend, Including Director Gu</p>
<p>Since its establishment last autumn, the Shanghai National Education Advancement Association has nearly 5,000 public and private elementary school teachers and staff participating, making it the largest organization in Shanghai's education community. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the association held its second general membership meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium. Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau, Deputy Director Li, education expert Du Zuozhou, and principals and teachers from public and private elementary schools, totaling more than 3,500 people, attended. Chief Zhu Ruoti presided over the meeting and reported on the two major goals of the National Education Advancement Association: (1) to assist the government in promoting national education, and (2) to unite colleagues and promote welfare and continuing education work. In recent years, the development of national education in Shanghai has been quite rapid, and colleagues in this association have made the most contributions. It was reported that the National Education Cooperative has already distributed goods twice, such as cloth, dried goods, and daily necessities, at extremely low prices, which can be seen as a work to improve the welfare of colleagues. It is hoped that colleagues in the advancement association will participate more.</p>
<p>Du Zuozhou Gives a Speech</p>
<p>Then Dr. Du Zuozhou was introduced to give a speech on the topic of "Why We Need Better Education," briefly stating: In the past century, the educational facilities in our country have not achieved satisfactory results. Elementary education has failed to cultivate children to be good citizens, and it is also a major question whether secondary education can cultivate healthy and excellent young people. Universities are limited by equipment, faculty, and other factors, and have not been able to develop. Therefore, colleagues in the education community should deeply reflect and strive to improve. The future development of national education should have the following conditions: (1) cultivate good habits, (2) pay attention to practical life, (3) cultivate a love of learning, and (4) strengthen physical fitness. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to expand the quantity and improve the equipment on the one hand, and to stabilize the lives of people in the education community on the other hand, so that education can exert its great effect.</p>
<p>Director Gu Gives a Speech</p>
<p>After Secretary Xu of the Municipal Party Department delivered instructions, Director Gu gave a speech: briefly stating that he believes that education is the most important during the nation-building period, and that teaching is the most important. The development of national education in Shanghai owes much to the assistance of enthusiastic people in the community, and on the other hand, we must also thank the efforts of the teachers. He then reported that among the 300-plus private schools that collected tuition fees this time, only 20-plus schools exceeded the standard, and he hopes that they will return the fees immediately. He understands that the lives of private school teachers and staff are difficult and has submitted a request to the mayor to allocate low-priced rice to private school colleagues. As for the finances of private schools, he hopes that they will be completely transparent and reasonably allocated. As for the academic advancement fees for teachers in municipal schools, the Municipal Council has approved them and included them in the budget, and teachers in both urban and rural areas can receive subsidies. This can show that the councilors represent public opinion, and it is hoped that teachers can work with peace of mind. Although the number is not large, the significance is very profound. After the speeches, there were many entertainment programs. It did not adjourn until 1:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Gymnasium is Packed; China United Wins Again Against Columbus</h3>
<p>42-47 China United, under the Command of Da Li, Wins by Five Points; Excellent Performance Defeats American Soldiers</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Municipal Gymnasium was packed last night, with a grand scene no less impressive than when the Qunsheng Troupe came to Shanghai. In the second major battle between China United and the U.S. Navy's Columbus, China United once again defeated the American team by five points, 47-42, with the first half score at 34-14. In the second half, Columbus launched a fierce counterattack, fighting more and more bravely. The American team scored 28 points, while China United scored only 13, making it a narrow victory. If the American team had not lost so many points in the first half, they might have caught up. However, China United's performance was indeed very hardworking and excellent. China United's basketball skills have greatly improved. Wu Chengzhang "flew all over the court," capable of both defense and offense, and can be called one of the most contributing members last night. Lao Bao's one-handed shots were extremely accurate, and Da Li's command of the team was indispensable. Xue Chong's teamwork was effective, and they worked together to defend with all their strength. Although Liang Xiong came on the court last, he made outstanding contributions. It was quite difficult to fight against their eight-person rotation with only six players.</p>
<p>China United Team: Elated</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong made a basket outside the free-throw line. With a flick from Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang cut in and scored again. Bao Songyuan scored the third basket, and China United immediately went up by six points, with impressive momentum. Xie Fang committed a foul, and Li Shi'ai missed his free throw, scoring one point. Chengzhang scored, 8-1. Cooper added fuel, increasing it to three points. Bruce made it five points. Zhenzhong made a free throw, 9-5. Bai Laofu and Chen Xuechong then showed their skills, 11-6. Te Lin-hua replaced Bai Na-tuo, and Chengzhang and Xuechong made contributions to each other, 16-7. Chengzhang made a risky save under the basket and passed it far to Songguo, who used a feint to deceive the American soldier and scored with a one-handed shot. The movement was clear, 18-9. China United maintained its lead all the way, with cheers erupting. At this time, the American sailors made a major adjustment to their lineup, "exchanging tall players for tall players," but they still could not stop China United's advance. Songyuan, Ai Xu, Chengzhang, and Bruce all made contributions, 23-14. In the first half, China United was elated.</p>
<p>Columbus: Slightly Inferior</p>
<p>Bruce, Ai Xu, Cooper, Bai Na-tuo, and Bruce constituted the starting lineup for the second half, the same as at the beginning of the first half. Bruce often broke through from the right, easily scoring two baskets. Zhenzhong's two shots under the basket were both wasted due to incorrect angles, but with a rebound, he passed the ball to Xuechong, who scored, making up for the mistake. Chengzhang then scored again, and Bruce broke in, making it 28-20. Zhenzhong made a shot and a free throw, both hitting the target, 31-22, still nine points behind. Te Lin-hua replaced Bai Laofu, and China United called its third timeout. Li Zhenzhong's shot hit the basket support. Ai Xu jumped up, with his hand higher than the basket ring. The American team advanced directly in a rapid chase, with Ai Xu and Bruce scoring, 33-28, closing in, only five points behind. Songyuan and Bruce then showed their colors, still five points behind. Li committed a foul, but Bruce was too nervous and missed both free throws, resulting in no points. The situation showed tension. Xuechong and Ai Xu each scored (38-32). Bao made a temporary shot, the opponent fouled, the ball went in, and another free throw was made, adding three points, 41-34. Ren Xiangcheng fouled out and was replaced by Zhang Liangxiong, who immediately recorded two points on the credit book within 30 seconds. Li Zhenzhong and Bruce fought back and forth, 45-40, with only three minutes left. Zhang Jian made his second contribution, 47-42. China United called its fourth timeout, 47-42. Ai Xu fouled out and Cross was brought in, 47-42. In the end, China United won by only five points.</p>

<h3>Five Thousand Spectators Amazed; Green Team Triumphs in the Capital, Narrowly Defeating Lizhi Team; Mingyuan and Zhenbao's Performance is Wonderful</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The Green Team, which won this year's Shanghai Women's Basketball League Championship, made its debut in Beijing on the 9th, immediately overwhelming the capital's strong team, Lizhi, by a score of 17 to 13. The beauty of their passing and the strength of their defense left a deep impression on the 5,000 spectators in the audience. The wonderful performances of Huang Mingyuan and Liu Zhenbao were particularly breathtaking.</p>
<p>Lizhi Leads by One Point</p>
<p>The game started at around 3:20 PM. The Green Team players were Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Li Yunzhi, Liu Zhenbao, Wang Weizhen, Wu Ailian, and Wu Meiying. The Lizhi Team countered with their most elite players, Chen Baixue, Chen Jinchai, Liu Shouguang, and others. The referee was Wen Zongyuan. Lizhi had the advantage of home court, and the Green Team was not used to outdoor play. Lizhi opened the scoring first. Mingyuan and others launched several counterattacks, but due to their eagerness to win, they failed to score. Soon after, Lizhi scored again. The Green Team's formation saw enemy cavalry running rampant, and the situation appeared critical. Fortunately, Mingyuan scored a basket from the midst of the enemies, breaking the egg. In the first quarter, Lizhi led 4-2. With the gong sounding again, the Green Team launched a full-scale attack. Zhenbao missed a free throw, and Mingyuan's shot missed. The Lizhi players returned again and shot at the basket as many as eleven times in two minutes, finally managing to score one basket. The scoreboard showed 6-2. The Green Team hurriedly called a timeout to discuss strategy. With the battle cry sounding again, the Green Team's forwards fought bravely, with repeated beautiful passes. Mingyuan made a free throw, and the situation improved slightly. Mingyuan then made another free throw, resulting in a 6-6 tie. The first half ended, with the Lizhi team leading by one point, 7-6.</p>
<p>Green Team Soars</p>
<p>The second half began, and the overall situation was still under the control of the opponent. However, the Shanghai players were ultimately experienced and capable of fighting. Numbers 3 and 9 shuttled across the Lizhi territory, resulting in a 9-9 tie. The score then soared upwards. Mingyuan's accurate shooting posed a great threat to the opponent, leveling the score into an absolute advantage of 15-9. Although Lizhi frequently substituted players, the overall trend was irreversible. At this time, the Shanghai team players did their best to demonstrate their new-style tactics such as blocking, dazzling the Lizhi players. In the end, the visiting team won 17-13. To award merit, Mingyuan scored ten points alone and deserved the greatest credit. Zhenbao did not seem to be in her best condition. It is heard that the Green Team still has games in Beijing, but due to vacation schedules, the team decided to return to Shanghai by overnight express train on Monday.</p>

<h3>Basketball Notes</h3>
<p>In the basketball friendly match between China United and Columbus, the Municipal Gymnasium was packed last night, no less than when the Qunsheng Troupe came to Shanghai.</p>
<p>China United fielded Da Li, A-Di, Xuechong, Lao Bao, and Xiangcheng, which is their strongest lineup. Although Xiangcheng is not good at shooting, his long and short passes are well-timed. China United's performance was therefore more active, and they defeated Columbus again.</p>
<p>Da Li remains a leading figure, finding gaps and passing quickly, allowing Xuechong, A-Di, and Lao Bao to score. A-Di and Lao Bao are currently in top form. Lao Bao's interceptions and A-Di's steals are admirable, and Xuechong's skills under the basket are gradually returning to their former level.</p>
<p>Columbus's biggest weakness is their lack of technique in passing, often being intercepted by China United. Their shooting skills have also not reached a good level. Only the right guard, Cooper, can dribble and shoot well, and the center, Bai Laofu, is barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the first half, China United held an absolute advantage, leading 18-7 and 23-12. In the second half, with the score at 41-34, Ren Xiangcheng fouled out for the fifth time, and Zhang Liangxiong came on as a substitute, immediately showing his long-range shooting ability.</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong showed signs of fatigue ten minutes before the end of the game, probably due to overexertion in recent days.</p>
<p>Based on last night's lineup and performance, China United can defeat the combined Navy, Army, and Youth team by three goals. (Chang Nian)</p>
<h3>Donghua Maintains Perfect Record with Ninth Consecutive Victory, Defeats Soviet Team Again</h3>
<p>Long Hai and Youliang Each Score a Goal in the Second Half</p>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Donghua continued to maintain its winning streak, defeating the Soviet team again yesterday, creating a glorious record of nine wins in nine games in the A Division. In the first half, the Soviet team resisted strongly, and neither side scored. In the second half, Long Hai and Youliang each scored a goal, securing the victory. Yesterday, there were over 8,000 fans at the Yiyuan Stadium, and the atmosphere was quite lively. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:</p>
<p>Donghua</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen, Han Longbo, Xin Fuzhen, Lin Wenhua (Down), Yu Qiaxing (Up), Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe (Up), Yu Qiaxing (Down), Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>Bao Saiweiqu, Kaloliequ, Gutofu, Shaleining, Jielinggufu, Tiefu Ninogolofu, Gelinasi, Laobusi Tuofu, Quebi Gufu, Bolang (Down), Kapusiting (Up)</p>
<p>Stalemate</p>
<p>Referee Chen Jixiang, linesmen Yue Xiurong and He Chunhui, blew the whistle to start the game. The Soviet team attacked first, with the "Little Yellow Hair" attacking. Fuzhen cut off his path. Gelinasi committed another foul. In Donghua's territory, enemy cavalry ran rampant. The "Little Yellow Hair" missed his shot. Donghua counterattacked, but also without success. After eight minutes, Longhai probed the defense, but was offside. Before long, Jia Youliang cut in from the corner, with a very good landing point. Longhai headed the ball, but unfortunately it was too high. Lao Sun's shot was saved by Bao Saiweiqu. The two sides were at a stalemate for 20 minutes. After 25 minutes, the nephew and uncle Youliang and Mingzhe switched positions. After about five minutes, Mingzhe crossed from the baseline. Jinshun's "iron leg" failed, and the ball bounced off Gutofu. Near the end of the first half, Jia Youliang and Bian Luoliequ collided, and Youliang was injured. The first half ended, with neither side scoring, 0-0.</p>
<p>Two Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>Changing sides and resuming the battle, the Donghua forwards advanced, attacking relentlessly. After five minutes, Sun Lao Jin crossed the ball, and Longhai lightly flicked the ball into the net from five yards away, 1-0. Donghua opened the scoring. The Soviet team, having lost the first city, launched a full-scale counterattack. Lingen and Youren parried from left and right, handling the situation calmly. After 15 minutes, Sun Lao Jin deployed another brilliant plan. Youliang passed the ball to the right wing, but unfortunately Mingzhe failed to seize the opportunity. After a long melee, the Soviet team was unable to succeed and changed their formation. Gelinasi was transferred to right inside forward, Quebi Gufu to right wing, and Kapusiting changed to left inside forward. This proved to be effective. However, the Donghua defenders defended tightly, without any mistakes. After 31 minutes, Kapusiting was injured and left the field, replaced by Bolang. Donghua took advantage of the opportunity to enter. Jinshun pounded hard, bounced back off Gutofu, and Youliang hooked back, sending the ball into the net again, making it 2-0. At this time, Lin Wenhua replaced Chen Mingzhe, but before long the game ended and the whistle blew. Donghua defeated the Soviet team again, winning 2-0 and creating a great achievement of nine wins in nine games.</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Chain System Provided by Ye Xuxin, Director of the Importers and Exporters Association, Suggesting the Establishment of a Foreign Exchange Review Committee for Imports and Exports</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Recently, the chain system for imports and exports has been strongly promoted in the city's import and export circles. Yesterday, Ye Xuxin, Director of the Importers and Exporters Association, provided a written opinion on the implementation of the import and export chain system, stating that the business of Chinese import and export companies is currently on the verge of collapse. The root cause is that domestic commodity prices are rising daily, exceeding foreign market prices, making it difficult to properly value exported domestic goods. For importers, the government provides very few foreign exchange quotas for legitimate business use, and all foreign exchange applications are often delayed by the authorities for months without any attention. This forces companies to cancel contracts, resulting in considerable losses in telegrams and other expenses. However, the high commodity prices and the lack of foreign exchange quotas are also due to unavoidable difficulties faced by our society and government. Unless the domestic situation is clarified, our businesses will not be able to escape this suffering. Given this reality, during this transitional period, our businesses must find other ways to maintain operations, which is the reason for advocating the chain system. The chain system allows businesses to use the foreign exchange earned from exports for the foreign exchange quotas needed for imports. In other words, the foreign exchange quotas needed for a company's imports and acquired from its exports must offset each other. China has always had a trade deficit, meaning that the foreign exchange quotas needed for imports exceed the foreign exchange earned from exports. If this chain system is adopted, it will indirectly force businesses to reduce imports of non-essential foreign goods, while encouraging people to work hard to expand exports and earn foreign exchange. The benefits of this method for the country and its people cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>However, if this chain system is not properly managed, it could lead to unimaginable problems. First, it could raise the value of foreign exchange domestically, creating a black market for foreign exchange. Because China is a country with a trade deficit, Chinese importers will inevitably compete to collect foreign exchange quotas, perhaps even secretly increasing prices to achieve their purchase desires. This will lead to the emergence of a black market for foreign exchange. Some, eager to obtain foreign exchange to pay for their imported goods, may not hesitate to sell export goods at a reduced value, effectively lowering the price of Chinese goods in foreign markets. In this situation, merchants who engage in both import and export can still survive by using the profits from imported goods to offset the losses from exports. However, those who only engage in exports will be unable to maintain operations, and will either have to shut down completely or resort to mixing inferior goods with the good. Would this not damage the reputation of China's entire presence in foreign markets? Therefore, to achieve good results by implementing this chain system, a thorough management mechanism is necessary. Now, I will briefly offer a few suggestions for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Export goods must be sold at government-set prices. However, these price limits must be based on the market prices at the destination. Exports are not allowed below this price limit. This can prevent importers and exporters from reducing prices to seek sales, which would affect foreign markets. These price limits can be announced by the government at any time based on reports from Chinese commercial officials abroad.</p>
<p>(2) To encourage the export of materials, the government should provide as much convenience as possible in transportation and should provide very low-interest loans.</p>
<p>(3) To maintain China's reputation and prevent merchants from mixing inferior goods with the good, the inspection of goods should be strengthened, and detailed regulations should be established for the grades and standards of exported goods. Experts from each industry should be hired to participate in the inspection work. "Because those outside the industry cannot fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the industry, and the import and export of materials can also be easily investigated."</p>
<p>If exporters can achieve this goal, it will increase the quantity of exports and obtain more foreign exchange quotas.</p>
<p>(4) The total amount of foreign exchange obtained from exports and distributed for imports should be published in the newspapers every week to strengthen the confidence of businesses and the public.</p>
<p>(5) Except for a certain percentage retained by the government, the rest of the foreign exchange earned from exports can be used by businesses for imports at their request.</p>
<p>(6) A foreign exchange review committee for import and export chain methods should be established. In addition to representatives dispatched by government agencies, the National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the Importers and Exporters Association should also be allowed to send representatives to participate.</p>
<h3>The Shantou Commercial Association Held its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Oil Commercial Association held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at No. 377, Minguo Road. One hundred and fifty-five oil commercial members attended, and the guests included Qian Simin, a specialist from the Social Affairs Bureau, Inspector Wu Yimin, Zhou**, a representative from the Municipal Party Department, Meng Jingshan, a representative from the Police Bureau, Yu Yulin, a representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Huang Bingquan, a municipal councilor. Member Zhang Chao was elected as the chairman of the meeting, and he reported on the preparations. He stated that the city's oil commercial industry was originally included in the Soybean, Rice, Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cake Industry Association, but now it is necessary for the oil commercial industry to establish its own industry association. The Social Affairs Bureau ordered it to be separated from Soybean, Rice, Miscellaneous Grains. Since the preparation, a total of 224 members have been registered, and more than a dozen have not yet been registered. Qian Simin and Wu Yimin of the Social Affairs Bureau and Zhou ** of the Municipal Party Department gave speeches, and Huang Bingquan and others gave speeches. After the draft articles of association were adopted, 15 directors were elected: Zhang Chao, He Peiqing, Yang Wumingju, Xie Boqin, Li Binyuan, Yan Jisheng, Hua Yuanshen, Yuan Wendao, Jiang Gongxian, Li Binyan, Chen Yaoting, Jin Zhiliang, Xu Zhixiang, Yu Liangji, and Ding Zishou.

<h3>Textile Construction Increases the Amount of Domestically Purchased Cotton</h3>
<p>To maintain domestic cotton production and regulate the rural economy, the Textile Construction Company is making every effort to purchase domestic cotton. The company originally planned to purchase 800,000 bales of domestic cotton in this agricultural production year, but as of yesterday, the company's statistics show that it has received 955,000 bales. Because of this they are even more excited. They have ordered staff in Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei and other places to continue to work hard to purchase and are now aiming for a target of 1.2 million bales. The company estimates that it will need 3.75 million bales of cotton this year. In addition to purchasing American cotton, it will be able to blend in one-third of domestic cotton this year. In order to cooperate with national policy and earn foreign exchange, the company, in addition to shipping 2,000 pieces to Hong Kong earlier, has also shipped more than 100 pieces of cotton yarn and 50,000 pieces of cloth to Southeast Asia for sale in order to capture overseas markets, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Tea Production Has Not Recovered, Factory and Trade Transactions are Quiet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th] Tea is one of the major special products of Zhejiang Province, and the production areas are all over the province. During the war, exports were blocked and production was sharply reduced. To this day, it has not yet recovered. According to the survey and statistics of the Agricultural Improvement Institute, the production and sales situation last year was 274,000 dan, and the total number of domestic and foreign sales was 100,000 zu, a decrease of three-quarters compared with the pre-war period. There are more than 130 tea factories and more than 80 tea companies in the province. At the end of last year's settlement, 19 were at a loss, and more than 50 tea companies had closed down. Currently, due to the fact that the tea market has not yet arrived and due to the current situation, transactions are sparse. Brokers are opening the market. Mao tea big square is 480,000 to 700,000, Qiang is 500,000 to 600,000, Hong Qing is 400,000 to 430,000, Jiang Hong is 300,000, Jing tea Longjing is 80,000 for the best grade per catty, 30,000 for the medium grade, and 8,000 to 10,000 for the inferior grade.</p>
<h3>The Fir Market in Our City is Stable</h3>
<p>Fujian continues to have fir wood arriving at the port, and the market price is within the 1,000 yuan range. Yangsong is also hovering around the 4,000 range.</p>
<h3>The Current State of World Currency Under the Control of the US Dollar – Everyone Hopes to Buy More American Goods, so There are Artificial Official Prices</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 9th] This issue of "Newsweek" analyzes the world currency situation, stating: Currently, there are three major currency areas: the US dollar, the Soviet ruble, and the British pound. Although the Swiss franc is technically stronger than the US dollar, the US dollar dominates the world because it can be used to purchase American industrial products. The officially set exchange rates of various countries are artificial and very different from free market exchange rates. When the International Monetary Fund was established last December, the officially set exchange rates reported by 22 countries could not truly be accepted at their face value. Because every country hopes to buy American goods as much as possible, they set an artificial official price for their currency. For example, in the New York currency market, the British pound is worth US$2.98, and the Egyptian pound is the same price. The official price is US$4.033 for the British pound and US$4.15 for the Egyptian pound. The official price of the Australian pound is US$3.22, and the actual price is US$2.55. The currencies of other countries are also much lower than the official price. Taking one US dollar as a unit, the official prices and free market prices of various countries' currencies are compared as follows:</p>
<p>Official Price Free Market</p>
<p>Belgian Franc 42.8 58</p>
<p>French Franc 119.107 290</p>
<p>Luxembourg Franc 42.8 90</p>
<p>Indian Rupee 3.3 5</p>
<p>Italian Lira 225 590</p>
<p>Dutch Guilder 2.65 6</p>
<p>Swedish Krona 3.6 4</p>
<p>Norwegian Krone 4.96 6.25</p>
<p>Danish Krone 4.79 7.5</p>
<p>Czech Koruna 50 115</p>
<p>Greek Drachma 4950 6300</p>
<p>Finnish Markka 135.40 400</p>
<h3>Comparison of Silk Industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Today</h3>
<p>China's silk industry suffered huge losses due to the direct and indirect impact of Japan's violent plunder and military operations during the Anti-Japanese War. The China Silk Company has published a detailed estimate and is currently conducting another investigation into the actual situation. It is reported that the comparative figures for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui today and in the past are roughly as follows: Silk factory units: 135 before the war, 129 now, a decrease of 6. Number of silk reeling machines: 35,481 before the war, 2,35 now, a decrease of 24,246. Number of silk reeling machines that can be started: 30,000 before the war, 11,000 now, a decrease of 90,000. Silk reeling capacity of operating silk reeling machines (dan): 90,000 before the war, 33,000 now, a decrease of 57,000. Number of dan of dried cocoons required as raw materials: 405,000 before the war, 148,500 now, a decrease of 256,500. Number of dan of dried cocoons of raw silk materials: 574,000 before the war, 75,000 currently, a decrease of 499,000. The surplus of cocoon raw materials for silk production before the war was 169,000 (Customs dan), and now there is a shortage of 73,500 (Customs dan), it is said.</p>
<h3>New Initiatives in the Transportation Industry: Establishment of a Marine Repair Department</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Pacific Transportation Enterprise Company in this city was established in early July 1946, initiated by Yang Tongyi, Hu Ruixiang, Gu Yuqi, Gu Yuxiu, Yang Tianling, and others. It was formally established on October 1st. Initially, a transportation department was established, and later a repair shop was added to contract various repairs and vehicle loading projects. In early February of this year, three shallow-water landing craft were purchased, and new electric welding machines were installed to establish a marine repair department, specializing in facilitating the repair of all marine transportation vehicles. It is said that this is an innovation in our country.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Trade Statistics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 8th] Fuzhou's trade statistics for February show that exports were over 5.1 billion yuan, a decrease of a evil percentage compared with January, and imports were over 6 billion yuan, an increase of 10% compared with January, resulting in a trade surplus of over 900 million yuan. The main export goods were wood, paper, and shiitake mushrooms, and the main import goods were textiles, cotton yarn, cigarettes, and goods from Jiangsu and Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Export Statistics</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] During the period from August 1945 to December 1946, Japan exported a total of 86,427 bales of raw silk, of which 84,475 bales were exported to the United States, 1,212 bales to the United Kingdom, 700 bales to Australia, and 40 bales to New Zealand. During the same period, Japan exported a total of 900,000 yards of silk goods, of which more than 700,000 yards were exported to the United States.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Headquarters Expands Japanese Textile Capacity</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur's headquarters has recommended that the production capacity of Japan's cotton textile industry be expanded to 4 million spindles "as a temporary measure" with the aim of slightly increasing Japan's exports in the coming years. Japan currently has 2.5 million spindles.</p>
<h3>Egypt No Longer Requires Import Licenses for Tea</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] The Egyptian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has announced that Egypt can now import tea from various countries without import licenses. These imported teas will be sold according to the rationing regulations to supplement the shortage of goods controlled by the bureau. The sales conditions for imported tea have been formulated. The price of tea will be controlled, and the profits of importers, wholesalers, and retailers must not exceed 25% of the cost, including import expenses and tariffs.</p>
<h3>British Representative to Go to the US to Purchase Japanese Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 8th] It is learned that a representative of the British Trade Bureau will soon go to Washington to discuss the final details of the plan for Britain to purchase 50 million yards of Japanese-woven cotton cloth from the United States. The Trade Bureau intends to complete the processing procedures for this cotton cloth in Lancashire and then transport it to countries that supply Britain with food and raw materials. The United States has supplied Japan with a large amount of cotton in recent months to weave cotton cloth. Before the war, Lancashire exported 7 billion yards of cotton cloth annually, of which 50 million yards were exported to Japan. Now, due to reduced production, Britain has to purchase Japanese-woven cotton cloth. People in the textile and transportation industries here have expressed shock at this.</p>
<h3>1947 US Industrial Outlook</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Increased Production Will Lower Prices</p>
<p>The fear that 1947 might be a year of recession has gradually disappeared, and what follows is the new hope that this year will continue to be prosperous. Industrial leaders are devising plans to break production records. At the same time, a belief is emerging that consumers, who have been battered by high prices for many years, can now share in the prosperity of the country. Most economists predict that as a result of increased production, prices will gradually fall.</p>
<p>The activity plans formulated by various industries for this year unanimously express optimism about the increase in production. The steel industry expects to produce 90 million tons of steel this year, with a net profit of US$3 billion. The automobile manufacturing industry has set a goal of manufacturing 5 million cars this year and hopes to exceed this number. According to reliable estimates, the demand for new cars will exceed the supply in the next two or three years.</p>
<p>Due to the 17.6% increase in freight rates, American railroads can increase their income by US$1 million and are currently making huge investments to add new equipment. Appliance manufacturers hope to meet the huge demand this year. The prospects for other industries such as aircraft manufacturing, radio, electricity, oil, gas, chemical raw materials, and building materials are generally optimistic.</p>
<p>Experts predict that if the production plans of various industries can be implemented one by one, then consumers can share the benefits. They predict that the price decline of 1920 will reappear today. That year was also the second year after the war, just like 1947. Prices rose to their peak in the first half of the year and then fell back sharply, gradually decreasing rapidly. By the end of the year, the price of textiles had fallen by half, food had fallen by a quarter, and manufactured goods had fallen by a fifth.</p>
<p>The reason for the price decline at that time was the surge in production and consumers' resistance to high prices, that is, the boycott movement. Now, these two factors are also working towards the same goal. Economists point out that current production is more than double that of 1920. Although most durable goods are still not easy to buy, wholesalers will soon have surplus goods to sell. Examples of production sufficient to meet needs are already common and need not be repeated.</p>
<p>The increase in production alone is already a strong force for leveling prices. If it is supported by consumers' refusal to buy, it will form an unparalleled weapon. At least in the United States, consumer resistance is not an organized movement of the public, but mostly due to the inability to afford it, so its effect is greater. Because a person is unable to buy something, no matter what threats or inducements are used, they will not weaken his resistance. What can persuade him is only to implement price cuts to suit his financial resources. However, whether the industry can proceed smoothly according to the established production plan and cause prices to fall depends largely on whether the labor situation is peaceful. If there is another strike like last year, the situation may be completely different.</p>
<p>The fact that the Republican Party has an advantage in the US Congress is beneficial to production. Because it greatly improves the political situation and will take steps to reduce national expenditures and support commerce.</p>
<p>In addition, the increase in the purchasing power of the American public is another factor that makes the industrial prospects for this year optimistic, because the increase in citizens' purchasing power is sufficient to increase the demand for goods.</p>
<p>The industry hopes that labor-management relations in 1947 will improve. It is generally believed that workers are becoming increasingly disgusted with strikes. At the same time, the public and Congress are expressing indignation at strikes, so strike losses in 1947 are expected to decrease.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although wholesale prices and the cost of living have increased, according to official figures, wholesale prices at the beginning of 1947 rose by 30% compared with last June, and the cost of living rose by 15%, but the general trend is that they will obviously fall back soon. Economists warn that the higher the price, the stronger the reaction before the time when production exceeds demand is about to come, because if the past massive expansion of production is not sold, it will inevitably affect the current production process.</p>
<p>After studying various favorable and unfavorable factors, economists have reached the conclusion that the situation in 1947 is often more favorable than in 1946, with the durable goods industry being more developed than before, and the non-durable goods industry being slightly inferior.</p>
<h3>Increased Production and Export of Tung Oil</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bo'an</p>
<p>After eight years of bitter fighting, China's only export material—tung oil—has declined to an unimaginable degree!</p>
<p>After the war, in each tung oil producing area, the tung trees have been frequently cut down. Now, according to estimates, the national annual output only averages about 35% of what it was before the war. In the areas that were occupied, there are even fewer tung trees. In the areas that were not occupied, the Trade Commission's control over unified purchase and sales in those years resulted in an extremely unreasonable suppression of the value of tung oil. Tung farmers could not make a profit. Just when food prices were rising, they cut down tung trees to grow food. After the blockade of the coastline, it was impossible to export. In addition to supplying a small amount of modified gasoline, the only outlet for tung oil was for use as lamp oil fuel in the countryside. There was no way to export, and the price was naturally low, so other vegetable oils could follow other local products in rising prices, while tung oil was plagued by misfortune and could not raise its head.</p>
<p>Before the victory, the Trade Commission purchased and accumulated tung oil. Because the sea route was blocked, tung oil was released. Before the victory, the average price in various places was 30,000 yuan per dan. After the victory, the coastal reserve currency was exchanged at a rate of 200 to 1, and converted into national currency, the numbers suddenly increased. For example, if tung oil is calculated at 30,000 yuan per dan, the price in reserve currency is 60 million yuan. At this time, the price of tung oil on the coast is definitely not 60 million yuan, so the price of tung oil has actually decreased. Last spring, exports showed a revival, and prices also slowly rose. Later, because foreign prices were low and the exchange rate was short, and by the end of last year, smuggling in Guangzhou was rampant, and regular exports were almost impossible. Exporters became semi-unemployed.</p>
<p>In the above process, production has declined to an extreme extent, and exports have also been affected, so that China's great export material has fallen into a tragic situation.</p>
<p>This spring, the transport association has attracted great attention, but the long-standing problem of the past eight years cannot be reversed in a short period of time. Therefore, the promotion of tung oil in foreign markets and the issue of increasing domestic production are urgent tasks.</p>
<p>So how will we increase production in the future? According to the Continental Daily News, it is believed that only by using high prices to attract farmers can we reverse the past passivity and achieve a rapid increase in production (see the Continental Daily News Associated Press telegram on February 20). We also think this method is very good, but now it is impossible to force foreign tung oil prices to plummet and domestic prices to rise without limit.</p>
<p>The only way is to think about reducing costs. Free transportation and low-interest bank mortgage loans are more achievable. Because all state-owned transportation vehicles can be transported free of charge, freight can be reduced a lot. In terms of national income, it can be said that the number is limited, and the mobility of production areas and export coasts will be greatly increased. At the same time, the high freight costs are transferred to Tung Chen, and the price of oil will also increase invisibly.</p>
<p>As for export merchants, they often cannot bear the burden of transportation time and high-interest loans due to the obstructed domestic transportation. If banks can provide low-interest mortgage loans, the future of exports will be very different from the present. First, the interest burden is reduced, and second, the funds will not be held down for years and months in terms of capital turnover, which will have a dual effect on export sales.</p>
<p>Secondly: We need to know that foreign markets are about to increase sharply in their need for Chinese tung oil. The Associated Press has also explained this point, "According to tung oil experts, the quality of Chinese tung oil is better than other industrial oils. It is a pity that China's oil refining methods are too outdated. If foreign scientific oil refining methods can be applied, production costs can be reduced and the oil quality can be improved." The industry has collected a lot of information on foreign tung oil substitutes, but in one sentence: Tung oil is tung oil. Due to the relationship between soil and trade, the quality of Chinese tung oil is superior to any substitute. The absorption of gas by Chinese tung oil is stronger than any drying oil, so the export prospects of tung oil are not bleak. On the contrary, in the future, we should greatly increase production from the two points of refining methods; the foreign tung oil market will re-enter our hands. The China Plant Oil Factory should be responsible for improving quality, and local governments should also include increased production movements as part of their consideration.</p>
<p>Last year's tung oil exports were 45,000,000 pounds, compared with the average of 209,100,000 pounds in the 25th and 26th years, accounting for only one-fifth. However, according to estimates from some sources, exports will not exceed 65 million pounds within two years. If this is the case, it is enough to discourage us. We think that the competition for time and space depends on human effort. If the authorities do not catch up quickly, then this large amount of foreign exchange will be abandoned invisibly. And it will not be easy to compete for foreign markets in the future. The above method is an easy way to do it, and I hope the authorities will consider adopting it.</p>

<h3>Divorce City</h3>
<p>In a democratic country, one can see "innovative" individuals, innovative enterprises, and even innovative cities everywhere. Reno, a small city that "started with divorce," lies quietly in a corner of the Rocky Mountains in Nevada.</p>
<p>I visited Reno on my way back from a trip to California. In that strange little city, I lingered for four days with curious eyes. According to the people of Reno themselves, they live in the largest small city in the world. As travelers step out of the train station and walk towards the intersection of the main street, they can see a magnificent archway with a large slogan written on it: "The Biggest Little City in the World." At night, the archway is fully decorated with colorful electric lights, and the train can be seen from dozens of kilometers away.</p>
<p>Reno, the Holy City, is like Diamond Earrings</p>
<p>In reality, the city of Reno is not too small. According to the Reno population statistics of July 1st last year, the city has about 30,000 people, with about 5,000 people living in the suburbs. If we consider "Washoe County," which is centered on Reno, the total number is 45,000 people, which is not small compared to other small cities in the United States. What I find most rare is that Reno's man-made and natural environments are completely mismatched. To put it simply, it is like a beggar woman with tattered clothes wearing two diamond earrings. The poverty and desolation of the entire state of Nevada is like a ragged beggar woman, and Reno and "Las Vegas" are the two diamond earrings of Nevada.</p>
<p>I didn't have time to go to "Las Vegas," which is close to Los Angeles and the world-famous "Boulder" dam. American friends in Nevada told me that Las Vegas is exactly the same as Reno, and it is a city that started its business in the same way, by "divorce." They said, "Reno is the boss, Las Vegas is the second child!"</p>
<p>A Courthouse is a Divorce Factory</p>
<p>"Washoe County" has a marble courthouse in Reno, which is the divorce factory of the United States, no, the entire world. According to the constitution of the American federal system, all forty-eight states have the right to enact their own civil and criminal laws (but they must not conflict with the constitution). Nevada's civil law regarding divorce and marriage is particularly "lenient," which is called the most Weak in American customs. Nevada's criminal law has no prohibited regulations except for prostitution and obscene performances. Gambling is public and fully encouraged by the local government. (Note: The author of this article will introduce Nevada's casinos in another article soon.)</p>
<p>Quick and Decisive, Marriage and Divorce are Simple</p>
<p>In Nevada, getting married only requires filling out a very simple form, paying a two-dollar certificate fee, and asking a pastor to officiate the wedding, and the problem is completely solved. Any family background investigation is completely waived. Divorce is slightly more complicated than marriage, but it is incomparable to any other state in the United States or any other country in the world. On my second day in Reno, I visited Mr. Bismore, the director of the public relations department of the Washoe County Courthouse. He said: Nevada only had formal laws at the end of the 19th century. In 1904, Nevada's divorce law stipulated the principle of "quick and decisive," which was quite sympathetic to citizens of other states in the United States, because although the United States is a country of free marriage, divorce is still a painful thing. In California, it usually takes at least a year from trial to judgment for a divorce case. In New York and Pennsylvania, it can even drag on for five years. The torture and pain suffered by both men and women are extremely severe. Therefore, "since Nevada stipulated quick and decisive procedures, many people have taken the train to Reno specifically to file for divorce."</p>
<p>Divorce Applications Adopt a Six-Week System</p>
<p>Because of this environmental need, in order to facilitate out-of-state residents to apply for divorce, the state legislature enacted a new law in 1911, stipulating that non-Nevada citizens must reside in Nevada for one year before they have the right to apply for divorce; in 1913, it was changed to "residing for six months"; in 1930, it was changed to "three months." Starting in May 1931, it was changed to "residing for six weeks." From that year on, the number of divorces increased sharply. In April 1931, the Washoe Court concluded only 174 divorce cases, which increased sharply to 524 cases in May. From May 1931 to the present, the so-called "six-week" system has been used, and there has been no change in between.</p>
<p>Each Brings a Lover, Men and Women Have a Tacit Understanding</p>
<p>Generally, people who come to Reno to go through divorce procedures are from the upper-middle class of American society. Most of these couples have a tacit understanding of divorce before they set off, and most of them bring their lovers, future prospective husbands or prospective wives, to Reno. Six weeks of leisurely "residence" forces them to bring a lot of gold and silver to spend and enjoy here. In this way, the desolate city on the desert prairie is nourished and prospered. Large-scale casinos are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. None of Reno's seventy-two hotels are not brightly lit and full of guests every day. The rent for a room at the "Riverside Hotel" is twenty US dollars a day, and even if you send a telegram in advance, you cannot "do it." The boss took a bunch of telegram papers and asked me to forgive him with a sad face: "So many people want to book rooms, only people move in, no one moves out, what can I do?"</p>
<p>Divorced Women Kiss Marble Pillars? Throw Wedding Rings into the River?</p>
<p>The Riverside Hotel is adjacent to the Reno River on the left and the County Courthouse on the right. There is a legend in Reno that women who have been divorced must kiss the four marble pillars at the entrance of the courthouse once the court ruling comes out, and they must throw their wedding diamond rings into the river. A certain American movie even filmed many street urchins with bare thighs touching diamond rings at the bottom of the river. In the Reno Public Library, I saw a book that called these stories "shameless lies." It said: Reno has never had these things. Since you are divorced, what rituals are you talking about?</p>
<p>Early in the morning, I lingered on the river bank for a long time. It was a thin stream of "clear spring gravel" like the Huansha Creek. Perhaps, how many people have shed tears here? How many people have laughed wildly here? In the courthouse, I heard two divorce cases. One was a divorced woman named Jenny from Washington State, about thirty-five years old, who had two children. She had been married for five years and is now applying for divorce. The man did not appear in court and hired a lawyer to represent him. The woman did not solemnly state the reasons for the divorce, and the man's lawyer did not express any objection. The judge's inquiry focused on the six-week residency: the day of arrival, the hotel where she stayed, and the hotel to which she moved. Did she leave Nevada in between? Then, the judge examined the statistical table and the proof of residency dates, and then ruled "Divorce granted."</p>
<p>This is not the judge's negligence. The judge himself is only executing the law. The law has no provisions for disallowing divorce, but you must reside continuously for six weeks. If there is one day in between that the applicant does not leave Nevada, then the application is equivalent to waste paper and completely invalid.</p>
<p>Divorce Granted in About Five Minutes Each</p>
<p>Bismore said: There are only two judges in the court, and the average time for hearing a divorce case is five minutes each. The court is not sloppy because of the five minutes. The court is still dignified and solemn. The judge's "robes," the female clerk's roll call, and the lawyers' advances and retreats are not ambiguous at all. In order to save time, it proceeds very tightly. Bismore said: This is entirely a matter of fact. Last year (1946), the Reno Court concluded a total of 11,175 divorce cases.</p>
<p>If we take months as the unit, the highest record was in December 1945, reaching 1,169 cases. That was after the Japanese surrender, when officers and soldiers returned home after being discharged from the army. The separation and reunion of men and women in troubled times created these tragic records. The lowest was in January 1941, with only 115 cases. That was after the Pearl Harbor Incident, when young men enthusiastically joined the army. "How can we make a home before the Huns are destroyed?" Naturally, there was no talk of divorce!</p>
<p>Marriage Takes Effect Immediately Two Hours After Divorce</p>
<p>A frightening number? I looked at the statistics Bismore gave me and couldn't help but feel horrified. But he smiled and said, "There's more, please look at the marriage figures! They are much more than the divorce figures!"</p>
<p>Getting married in Reno is freer than anywhere else. The law stipulates that marriage takes effect immediately two hours after divorce. Many divorced men and women turn from one couple into two couples in a short two hours. Last year, 29,104 couples got married in Reno, which is equivalent to two and a half times the number of divorces. Of course, there are also many real "new" grooms and "new" brides. The most interesting thing is the various forms in the court registration office. There are twenty-six "non-stop writing" staff working there all day long. At the entrance of the registration office, there is a counter with large books, and two kind old ladies are there to accept registrations. On the counter are "Summary of Nevada Divorce Law" and "Nevada Marriage Guide," many well-bound booklets, given to applicants for reference.</p>
<p>Open and Aboveboard, Pastors Also Advertise</p>
<p>I saw a not-so-"new" groom and bride paying two US dollars to apply for a marriage certificate. The man looked like a retired army officer. They were both from Oakland, across the river from San Francisco. The clerk told them that the certificate must have a pastor or judge as a witness, and it will only take effect after the witness signs. The clerk also told them that Reno only has two judges hearing cases, and they are very busy. It is best to find a pastor to officiate the wedding. She pointed to the wall opposite the counter, where there were more than thirty magnificent pastors' advertisements.</p>
<p>It was the first time I had seen pastors with advertisements. They printed very elaborate cards, explaining the different churches and the different experiences of each person.</p>
<p>Collecting Wedding Fees to Donate to the Church</p>
<p>That afternoon, I visited Pastor H. of the Methodist Church. There were gold letters written on the glass door of his office, like a trading company's "signboard." Inside, there were several rows of men and women waiting for him to officiate the wedding. Pastor H. took the time to meet me in the midst of his busy schedule and talked to me a lot about the religious principles of marriage for men and women. He said: "People all over the world think that Reno is a purely evil city, but few people understand that the number of people getting married in Reno every year is more than the number of divorces."</p>
<p>I asked Pastor H. two questions: First, how much do you charge each time you officiate a wedding? Second, what kind of teaching and comfort do you give to those who come to get married two hours after their divorce? Pastor H. was very unhappy, as if he thought my questions were too blunt. However, pastors are all well-mannered. He said: Many other churches charge very high wedding fees, which is not right. The Methodist Church does not charge fees, and they are free to donate. Each time it ranges from five to twenty yuan, and the donations are all used for the church. Second, although there are indeed people who come to get married immediately after a divorce, there are very few after all. Most of the weddings he officiates are for real grooms and brides.</p>
<p>Pastor H. said that he had officiated a wedding for a Chinese couple, but they were not Christians. He said: "The only requirement for me to officiate a wedding is to persuade them to believe in Christianity."</p>
<p>There are very few Chinese men and women in Reno, and even fewer who get divorced in Reno, but there are also some, but it is not a real divorce like Westerners, but for other (?) reasons.</p>
<p>An old overseas Chinese leader surnamed Guan introduced me to interview a lawyer named John Davidson in a majestic high-rise building with very elegant furnishings. Lawyer Davidson has been in Reno for seventeen years and has handled thousands of divorce cases. He has handled cases for citizens of all forty-eight states in the United States, as well as for overseas Chinese. He has also handled cases for people from England, Australia, and Canada. He was flipping through a Canadian divorce file and said, "This is a rather troublesome case!"</p>
<p>Unilateral Divorce Procedures are Not Complete</p>
<p>Curiosity prompted me to ask him many difficult legal questions. For example, I said: "I have a friend in New York whose relationship with his wife is not good. The husband wants to come to Nevada to get a divorce, but the wife is quite conservative and would rather die than accept the divorce conditions. May I ask, what can that gentleman do? If the husband comes here and divorces unilaterally, will it take effect?"</p>
<p>Lawyer Davidson was surprised and said: "This is your Chinese situation. Americans don't do this. If a husband doesn't love her and the couple can't live together, why must they keep the name of the couple?" Then he added: Nevada's divorce law must be recognized by each state separately before it can take effect in each state separately. New York State hates Nevada's divorce the most. If the husband obtains a unilaterally approved divorce here, if he returns to New York and remarries, the original wife can sue in the New York court. If he does not return to live in New York State, his unilateral divorce still has a legal basis. However, in any case, the Nevada court must transfer this case to New York, and it will only be truly completed legally after the original wife living in New York signs and agrees."</p>
<p>The lawyer said: In the United States, there is no such thing as "I would rather die than get a divorce." The establishment of a marital relationship depends on the emotional connection between the two parties. Since one party has no emotion at all, the other party at most asks for some material compensation. Therefore, he believes that Nevada's law is not only reasonable, but also in line with human nature. He said: Many British and Canadian people come to Reno to get divorced, and at first their spouses are quite unwilling. However, since one party is determined to come to Reno, the other party has only one way to negotiate and demand compensation.</p>
<p>He also said: "If your hypothetical friend in New York comes to Reno to go through unilateral divorce procedures, and if he resides in Nevada for a long time after the procedures are completed, then even if the other party does not agree, there is nothing that can be done."</p>
<p>According to Lawyer Davidson's experience: American divorce cases rarely have such huge alimony fees as in China, unless the man gives it voluntarily, and the court rarely awards alimony, and even if there is, it is extremely small.</p>
<p>He said that although Nevada's law opens a convenient door for divorce, the law pays great attention to protecting infants, because "infants are the seedlings of the people, and we cannot harm them." He also said: Divorced parents, if the mother does not agree, the father cannot forcibly take the infant. The divorced father should be fully responsible for the infant's education and upbringing. "The so-called alimony is mostly for the infant, not for the abandoned wife." Lawyer Davidson spoke eloquently and became more and more energetic! "The abandoned wife has the ability to survive, she can remarry and be a bride again, why should she be supported?"</p>
<p>It is not easy for an Oriental to observe Western society. I suddenly thought of Wu Fangji's "Wanrong Ci" and the "one step, one look back" lament of the abandoned wife, and I really had endless feelings of vicissitudes!</p>

<h3>A Panoramic View of Keelung Harbor</h3>
<p>— Keelung Shipping News on the 8th, by Our Taiwan Correspondent Yang Yu</p>
<p>The island of Taiwan, surrounded by water on all sides, has a coastline extending 398 miles. There are as many as seventy-seven large and small islands nearby, with a winding coastline that makes it very inconvenient for ships to enter and exit. Many rivers are either torrentially swift or prone to flooding. Combined with the influence of summer low-pressure systems and winter seasonal winds, Taiwan's fisheries have always been constrained by these natural conditions, preventing them from developing. After the Japanese occupied the area, they placed emphasis on this work. In the seventh year of the Taisho era (1918), they established a fisheries section under the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, starting with Keelung as the center and engaging in sailing boat fishing. This can be said to be the beginning of planned fishing in Taiwan. In May of the ninth year of the Showa era (1934), they further invested 830,000 Japanese yen to build an excellent fishing port in Keelung. The water surface is wide and about five meters deep, which can accommodate about 400 fishing boats. On land, they also built a marine products hall, a fish market, a coral market, a fisheries radio station, warehouses, residences, a freezing factory, an ice-making factory, a marine products training center, and all other necessary facilities for a fishing port. Although fishing ports were also built in Kaohsiung, Suao, Hualien Harbor, Xinyi Port, Magong, and other places, they were not as perfect as Keelung.</p>
<p>The Japanese attached great importance to the marine products trade in Taiwan Province. They themselves admitted that the domestic political situation and economic conditions in China were barometers of the marine products trade. In order to compete for the market, they had to concentrate all their strength. Therefore, in the past, Taiwanese were excluded from all departments of the province's marine products industry, except for doing some menial labor. Speaking of marine products, the most serious problem now is still the talent shortage. The Japanese have all been repatriated, and it is almost impossible to immediately replenish personnel to even maintain a barely acceptable level of operations.</p>
<p>Marine Products School Cultivates 200 Cadres</p>
<p>Keelung Harbor is forever hidden in the misty drizzle. The first time I admired its true appearance, the impression I got was one of dilapidation and haggardness. From the rickshaw, I could see endless ruins of buildings, collapsed and piled everywhere. Nearly forty large-scale bombings have caused too much damage.</p>
<p>The Marine Products Hall in Hamacho was once the headquarters for the Japanese to operate the Keelung fishing port, but now the doors are tightly closed, and it squats quietly by the sea without any vitality. I looked inside through the cracks in the door, and it was full of dust and dark like a tangerine box. I heard that it was taken over by the navy, but in fact, it is not being used now. Further north, after walking quite a few mountain roads up and down, I saw the Marine Products Vocational School revealed from behind a stone tablet with the words "Imperial Road Clear and Smooth."</p>
<p>The predecessor of this provincial marine products vocational school was the Marine Products Training Center of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, established in 1943. The school buildings had not been completely completed, and the newly built workshops were destroyed by bombs. As a result, when the marine products school took over in December of the year before last, it only received two buildings and three bungalows. In the past, the training center was organized as a secondary school, but only had a junior high school section. After the restoration, a senior high school class was added. More than 200 students are allocated to this small number of rooms, which is really too cramped. Senior high school first graders are now divided into three classes: aquaculture, manufacturing, and fishing. Although the junior high school is not divided according to the instructions of the education authorities, in addition to general subjects, it also first teaches the basic common sense of marine products business. Among these three classes, the most emphasis is placed on fishing, followed by manufacturing. Only four students are currently enrolled in the aquaculture class. Important courses include swimming, boating, fishing gear science, manufacturing methods, aquaculture methods, marine products, meteorology, driving, marine product processing, fishing overview, fishing gear manufacturing, and marine biology. On average, there are about 40 hours of classes per week, which is quite demanding. However, barefoot students trek from various places by train and bus every day, rain or shine. This spirit of hard work and endurance is very commendable.</p>
<p>Because the pay is relatively low, it is not easy to hire teachers. At the same time, there are too few books on marine products business in the country. Here, they can only compile their own teaching materials and issue handouts, but due to limited funding, they cannot print many copies. The most common panic about people and books in Taiwan's education circles is even more evident here.</p>
<p>The fishing boat used for fishing department students' practice is now only the "Tai Whale" No. 140-ton Zhenke. Although there are hand nets, trawl nets, and other fishing gear, there are not many. The manufacturing department's workshop is currently being repaired, and it will probably take more than ten days to start work. Here, they are also prepared to process and manufacture fish food and canned goods themselves. The school authorities plan to expand the school buildings, renovate the auditorium, and add practice boats and fishing gear this year, with a budget of more than 20 million Taiwan dollars. Although it is not yet known how much will be obtained, everyone hopes that this school can occupy an important position in Taiwan's marine products business.</p>
<p>According to reports, the authorities recently prepared to set up a national marine products vocational school in the country. In Taiwan Province, in addition to this marine products school, there is also a Kaohsiung branch and a Penghu marine school. It is hoped that they can be linked up in the future and work together to promote and develop our country's marine products expertise.</p>
<p>Stinky Refrigeration Factory Produces 45 Tons of Ice Daily</p>
<p>The original site of the Keelung Hamacho branch of the South Japan Fisheries Company, which was very important in Japan, now has the signboard of the "Taiwan Marine Products Co., Ltd. Keelung Branch" erected. This company used to be very large, owning 200 fishing boats and building freezing factories and processing factories. However, by the end of the war, on the one hand, it was bombed, and on the other hand, because the Japanese occupied Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Hainan Island, they moved their focus to Kaohsiung, so it also declined for a while. But now it has returned to its former state, and the sound of motors has begun to sound again on this quiet seaside.</p>
<p>The processing factory was too badly damaged and cannot be used. It has now been converted into office space. Currently, the company's main business is fishing and ice making. Some of the original 200 fishing boats were turned into military use during the war, and some were sunk by bombing. After receiving them and sorting them out, about twenty or thirty can be used, and they have already been dispatched to sea to fish in batches. On average, a pair of fishing boats goes to sea twice a month and can harvest about 4,000 boxes of fish (36 pounds per box). Among them, the most common are sea bream and red sea bream distributed in the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. After being transported back, they are sold to fish markets everywhere. Because the demand is strong, the company often feels that the amount of fish caught is not enough to distribute. This can only be greatly supplied when the number of fishing boats increases in the future.</p>
<p>Factory Director Liu of the freezing factory led reporters on a tour of the factory. The freezing factory originally had three parts: refrigeration, processing, and ice making. The cold storage is still in its original state, with a total of fifteen rooms. The temperature is mostly below four degrees Celsius, and refrigerated fish can be maintained for one week to ten days. As mentioned earlier, the processing part has been converted into an office and has stopped operating. The ice-making factory could produce 135 tons per day during the Japanese era, but after the takeover, it was shut down until October of last year due to the need to repair the machines and the shortage of ammonia, the raw material for ice making. Now the company has established a factory that uses ryamine to manufacture ammonia, and has also purchased a lot of American ammonia. However, because there are too few fishing boats, the demand is greatly reduced. Now it can manufacture 45 tons of water per day. In addition to supplying fishing boats and selling to the public, there is still a surplus.</p>
<p>On a 400-horsepower compressor, thick ice has formed. After continuous compression, the ammonia is transported through countless pipes to every part that needs it. Everywhere here, you can smell a pungent odor. We also ducked our heads and drilled into the water-making room, which was so cold that it made people shudder. Rows of empty cylinders were hoisted by cranes to the bottom of the water pipes, filled with filtered seawater, and then placed in deep pits of calcium chloride water. Countless pipes with ammonia running through them began to absorb its heat. Usually, it only takes 24 hours to form a thick block of water.</p>
<p>Visiting the Marine Products Experiment Station on Sheliao Island</p>
<p>From the shore, I hired a small rowboat and crossed the green waters of the fishing port to the front of the Marine Products Experiment Station on Sheliao Island on the north shore. A few sparse tropical palm trees swayed forlornly in the slanting wind and fine rain. Director Li of the station went to Taipei on official business. Section Chief Zeng of the General Affairs Section received the reporter and told me in detail about the past history of this experiment station.</p>
<p>This used to be the Marine Products Experiment Station of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. In the past, the Japanese paid attention to both production and research, so many industrial, agricultural, forestry, and other industrial parts of Taiwan could be handled in an orderly manner. This is really a big reason. The Marine Products Experiment Station was initially divided into four departments: fishing, oceanography, processing, and aquaculture. In addition to engaging in technical fishing, the main work of "fishing" was to explore fishing grounds, investigate fish species, and then notify various fishing companies to catch them based on their clues. The "oceanography" aspect focused on the examination and measurement of tides, water temperature, seabed geology, etc. "Processing" was to take marine products to study quality and improve manufacturing. In the past, the Marine Products Experiment Station built many fishing boats. Among them, one ship, the Zhaonan Maru, weighed 418 tons and was well-equipped. It can be said to be the only fishing boat in East Asia that can simultaneously carry out fishing, oceanography, and processing work. It has now been received by Daoli in Kaohsiung and is being repaired intensively. The Marine Products Experiment Station has high expectations for it and believes that in the near future, it will exert excellent functions for the combined marine products business of Taiwan.</p>
<p>The buildings of the Marine Products Experiment Station were destroyed in the war, leaving only a section of short walls. After receiving them on December 21st of the year before last, it was not until May of last year that the office and workshop were hastily repaired. While sorting out the books retrieved from the fire and past reports, they searched for machinery scattered in various places. In September, they barely started working, continuing to follow the previous policy. It is expected that in the second half of this year, they may be able to contribute a little to fishing due to the completion of the replenishment of fishing boats. Due to the lack of equipment in oceanographic surveying, it is feared that the expected goal cannot be achieved. Currently, they can only use some simple instruments left by the Japanese to measure tides, water temperature, and the specific gravity of water once a day near the Bachi Gate in the fishing port. Currently, only a small amount of agar-agar can be manufactured in the processing field, but it is planned to manufacture canned goods and other fish foods within this year.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the chance of fish eggs being fertilized during spawning in the waves is only about 4%. Recently, technicians from here and personnel from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry conducted artificial incubation experiments in Gongguan, Taipei. As a result, more than 99% of the fish eggs can be hatched into small fish, and the satisfactory result of aquaculture experiments has been obtained. At the same time, this is also studying a work that the Japanese had not completed before, that is, how to add less caprylic acid preservative added to canned goods and still maintain its durability without changing quality and without affecting human health, because ordinary preservatives will have harmful effects on human body.</p>
<p>The Marine Products Experiment Station has a branch in Hualien Harbor, which specializes in aquaculture and has been very successful in the past, but the typhoon last year damaged the levee and caused a lot of losses, which is now being repaired. It is also planned to set up a branch in Kaohsiung to engage in the industrial research of fish skin tanning.</p>
<p>The three institutions in Keelung Harbor, which are growing up in suffering, are all trying to maintain themselves in simplicity, but simply maintaining is not enough. How to develop and expand in the future is a matter worthy of attention. Especially in China, where the marine products business has always been backward, it seems that it should be at this time to use the existing foundation to build some achievements, and we must not be shortsighted or follow the old ways.</p>
<h3>Swiftly Stabilizing the Great Southwest: Zhang Qun Going Back and Forth Between Nanjing and Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Chongqing Dispatch by Air on the 2nd, by Xiao Jin</p>
<p>Three Weeks of Dynamics Worth Noting</p>
<p>Since Zhang Qun went to the United States for medical treatment, and Deng Xihou acted as the chairman of Sichuan Province, the provincial administration of Sichuan has been turbulent due to the entire political situation in China. Especially after Zhang Qun returned to China from the United States, it happened to be during the period of government reorganization. News came from Nanjing that Zhang Qun might take office as the President of the Executive Yuan. People generally believed that the speculation revealed in the newspapers that there would be changes in the overall situation in the southwest was possible and reliable.</p>
<p>Returning to Sichuan from Nanjing to Announce the Mission of This Trip</p>
<p>Zhang Qun returned to Sichuan from Nanjing on February 1st, and made a brief stop at Jiulongpo Airport in Chongqing, and then went to Chengdu. In this short period of time, he announced the mission of his return to Sichuan. He said that he had not yet considered relinquishing his duties at the Chongqing Xingyuan (Field Headquarters), but he repeatedly declined the position of chairman of Sichuan Province, citing his lack of energy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the reporter mentioned the Xikang incident, which had been chaotic for many years. Zhang earnestly said that this was one of the main tasks of returning to Sichuan. How to deal with the Kang rebellion will have to be decided after a comprehensive study in Chengdu.</p>
<p>After Chairman Zhang went to Chengdu, the general speculation and disclosure in Chongqing newspapers were nothing more than Deng Xihou's official appointment as Chairman of Sichuan Province, Liu Wenhui's removal, the Mayor of Chongqing City being transferred to Chairman of Xikang Province, and Secretary-General of the Provincial Government Li Boshen being transferred to Mayor of Chongqing City.</p>
<p>"Protect the Homeland" Movement Petitions Zhang Qun</p>
<p>Following Zhang Qun's return to Sichuan, on February 2nd, people from Xikang in Chongqing established a "Protect the Homeland" Movement Committee, listing the political corruption in Xikang, the widespread opium, and the lawless military discipline, and put forward demands such as "removing Liu Wenhui, stopping military action in Kang, and appeasing the refugees." They petitioned Zhang Qun for the reorganization of the Xikang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>After Zhang went to Chengdu, he did not go to the provincial government to work from the 1st to the 5th, but only received guests in his private residence. On the 5th, he hosted a banquet for Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Xiao Yisu, and Xiang Chuanyi, and discussed the current situation in Sichuan and Kang during the banquet. On the 4th, Deng Xihou also invited Zhang and the above-mentioned people to a banquet, and the theme of the conversation was also the current situation in Sichuan and Kang.</p>
<p>Following that, the Sichuan Provincial Senate made a request to Chairman Zhang, hoping that the provincial government could be responsible by a dedicated person.</p>
<p>A few days passed peacefully.</p>
<p>On February 10th, the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Conference was held in Chengdu.</p>
<p>Pacification Conference Discusses All Matters</p>
<p>The Chongqing "Ta Kung Pao" on the 10th had a special dispatch from Chengdu that was worth noting:</p>
<p>"Zhang Qun is scheduled to leave Chengdu for Chongqing within the week. The military, political, and personnel issues of Sichuan and Kang must be decided after being reported to Chairman Chiang. Zhang hosted leaders from all walks of life in Sichuan and Kang in Chengdu, and said at the banquet: I have followed Chairman Chiang since the 15th year, and I have participated in the opinions of the Sichuan affairs. In the 27th year, he served as the director of Xingyuan (Southwest) with Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Pan Wenhua, and other military leaders in the Wanglingji Public House on the south bank of Chongqing, expressing his personal attitude towards Sichuan affairs. In the 29th year, he concurrently managed Sichuan's political affairs for six years. He has been deeply supported by all parties to reach the great responsibility of the people of Sichuan to resist the war and build the country. In the future, I am afraid that I will be summoned out of Sichuan at any time, and Deng Acting Chairman should be more responsible for Sichuan affairs. Sichuan and Kang were originally a family, and I hope that they will not be separated from each other and cooperate sincerely. Even if I do not concurrently manage Sichuan's political affairs, I will do my best to do everything for Sichuan and Kang with the relationship of hosting the Southwest Xingyuan..."</p>
<p>From this special dispatch, the changes in the military, political, and personnel affairs of Sichuan and Kang have been clearly revealed, and Chairman Zhang's ambiguous attitude towards local forces is also very obvious.</p>
<p>In addition to Deng and Liu, the participants of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Conference also included Xiao Yisu, Chief of Staff of the Xingyuan, Liu Wanli, Chief of Staff of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Command, and Wu Peiying, Chief of Staff of the 24th Army. Chief of Staff Xiao, Chief of Staff Liu of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Command, and Chief of Staff Wu Peiying of the 24th Army reported on their work, and discussed and decided on future public security, opium bandits, and joint defense of the southwestern provinces.</p>
<p>Before that, Zhang had sent Dong Jianer, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Xingyuan, to inspect the Ya'an area.</p>
<p>On the 12th, news came that Zhang Qun was returning to Chongqing.</p>
<p>On the 14th, Zhang was still not seen coming. News from Chengdu said that Zhang was waiting for Chairman Chiang's special plane "Zhuiyun," so he rescheduled to come to Chongqing on the 15th. Finally, on the afternoon of the 16th, the special plane "Zhuiyun" carried Zhang back to Chongqing from Chengdu.</p>
<p>At 4 pm on the 17th, Zhang attended the welcome meeting at the Victory Building hosted by Mayor Zhang Dulun and Speaker Hu Zixu. He reported on the Sichuan-Kang issue as follows: The Sichuan Provincial Government will not be reorganized for the time being, but I have served two terms based on the three-year term of an administrative official, so I plan to take full responsibility for the Xingyuan in the future. He also said that Deng Xihou, Director of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Command and Acting Chairman, has served in Sichuan for a long time and has an excellent reputation, and will surely be loved by the people of Sichuan.</p>
<p>Handling the Kang Rebellion by Differentiating the Good and the Bad and Suppressing and Appeasing</p>
<p>Regarding the Xikang part, he said that after many investigations, opium eradication was a main cause. Li Yuanheng and others who caused the Lichuan incident were all habitual bandits for many years. The solution has been decided at the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Conference to distinguish between the good and the bad and give them suppression and appeasement. He also said that Chairman Liu Wenhui has been in Kang for many years. This unfortunate incident was quite stimulated and has realized that political reforms should be made. He will convene a Kang government review meeting to seek reform.</p>
<p>Zhang flew to Nanjing at 9:30 on the morning of the 22nd, accompanied by Hu Ziang. That night, he visited Chairman Chiang to report on the recent situation in Sichuan and Kang.</p>
<p>In total, Zhang spent 31 days returning to Sichuan from Nanjing, staying in Chengdu for 15 days and Chongqing for 5 days. The Sichuan government issue and the Kang rebellion issue were all taken into account. The Kang rebellion issue has already had the decision to "distinguish between the good and the bad and give them suppression and appeasement," but there has been no specific indication on the personnel issues in the southwest. Due to Zhang Qun's movements after going to Nanjing, it seems that the Sichuan-Kang issue has become less important, but people generally hope for stability in the southwest. In China, where opium is everywhere, the southwest is relatively quiet, but the unstable political situation affects people's hearts. If Zhang Qun really takes office as the President of the Executive Yuan, he cannot ignore this point, and dragging it on is not a solution.</p>

<h3>Remembering a Wandering Writer: James Bennet</h3>
<p>— Ying Ming</p>
<p>The Juxianju restaurant in the eastern city of Beiping, judging from its ancient and dim facade, can be determined to be a monument with a long history. Legend has it that since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, many poets and hermits of the capital often used it as a gathering place, just like the Fulu Shou and Xin Ya restaurants in Shanghai, which are almost famous for attracting literati and writers.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1932, Dr. Jin Tonggu, a Korean doctor living in Nanchizi, invited me to Juxianju for a small gathering one evening because I was a regular customer of his—for treating neurasthenia—saying that there were several people of the same profession as me, so he took the opportunity to meet them. However, they were not Chinese. Because most of the people who came to him for treatment were European and American expatriates living in the eastern city.</p>
<p>Later that evening, when I took a tram from Xidan to the eastern city and then a rickshaw to Juxianju, the elegant private room that Dr. Tonggu had reserved in advance was brightly lit and filled with distinguished guests. When he saw me coming in, he got up to greet me, and the people present shook hands with me upon his introduction. Among them were two Westerners: one was very tall and thin; the other was of medium height, with a ruddy face and a rough appearance. According to Dr. Tonggu, he was the very famous novelist, Mr. Bennet from the United States. At that time, I was very surprised: Mr. Bennet was British and already over sixty years old, how could he be so young and heroic? Could there be another Bennet?</p>
<p>After a cigarette, we took our seats. During the meal, two Cantonese overseas Chinese mentioned many new scientific issues recently; and a young gentleman in a Western suit, said to be a close secretary to the deputy commander, then talked about several new discoveries in the marine world. I saw Mr. Bennet sitting in a corner, awkwardly using chopsticks to pick up shrimp kernels. I said to him: We are not bound by the custom of using chopsticks, it would be better to use a spoon. He smiled and said I won't be polite then. After taking two spoonfuls of shrimp kernels, he raised his glass and toasted me and Dr. Tonggu. Dr. Tonggu then said that there was an inextricable relationship between writers and alcohol, and asked him how Chinese Shaoxing wine compared to American beer. Mr. Bennet said that in recent years, drinking beer in summer and autumn was not very fashionable, and many people were used to "whiskey soda."</p>
<p>I didn't quite believe that this Mr. Bennet was the Arnold Bennet. I asked him what he had written recently. He was very happy, but he also made a melancholy expression, saying that he was used to living in the East and felt very alienated from the general life, making it difficult to find materials; he hoped to travel to Southeast Asia in the near future, because the weather was cooling down after autumn, which was the time to travel to various places around the equator. After the banquet, I asked him about the recent situation of several American writers—Dreiser, O'Neill, Fitzgerald. He said that he was not familiar with Dreiser, O'Neill was highly respected, but Fitzgerald was an idealist—so-so… He also told me many of his observations in China, and there were many comments in his words that I found difficult to understand. However, he held the same view as me, saying that artists were suitable for living in Beiping, because the climate and life in Beiping were not strict.</p>
<p>After the banquet, everyone hurriedly parted ways.</p>
<p>More than two months later, the frosty winds of Beiping picked up. I was going to the wedding banquet of a certain manager of the ×× Guoguang Society, and I thought of buying a gift that I should prepare, so I went to the flower shop at Dongdan Archway to buy a flower basket. Just as I got off the rickshaw, I suddenly saw two Westerners standing at the door of a Western-style wool shop next to the flower shop. The tall and thin one was the one I had seen at Dr. Tonggu's banquet. I greeted him and asked about Mr. Bennet. He said that Mr. Bennet had left early because his whereabouts were often uncertain.</p>
<p>In the twenty-third year, I lived in Hangzhou and often went to the library on Putao Lane (later renamed Daxue Road) to read newspapers. Once, I flipped through several American magazines and found the name James Bennet. The following year, I went to Shanghai and unintentionally talked about him with my friend C. Mr. C said that this Mr. Bennet was well-known in Shanghai, not only had he been a professor at St. John's University, but he had also published a collection of novels called "Plum Blossom and Blue Incense" by the Commercial Press. The few articles he wrote himself were very sincere in his attitude towards Chinese friends. Mr. C also said: Bennet was a reformer who did not flatter the Chinese. He held a dissatisfied attitude towards the old Chinese customs, although he inevitably carried some Chekhov-style satire, but the consciousness in his bones was correct.</p>
<p>In the twenty-seventh year, I returned to Hunan, and it happened that my younger brother Ren Yu had a copy of "Plum Blossom and Blue Incense" in his bookshelf, so I took it out and selected a few articles to read. I think the best three are—one is "The Woman Who Waited," one is "Singing Skipper" and "Wing's Interrupted Journey."</p>
<p>"The Woman Who Waited" depicts how Crandall, who was going to Sydney to take up the position of vice-consul in the consulate on a ship bound for Australia, became acquainted with his companion—a colonial military officer, and Ellery, a tax collector who was going to Australia to get married. He used psychological techniques to describe the special type of Ellery, which was very lively and vivid; he couldn't stop talking about his fiancée and "whiskey soda." "Singing Skipper" depicts a young singing skipper named Stanley Mac Tavish, who came from San Francisco to a certain port in the East to marry his fiancée A'huang. On the ship, because a Norwegian named Hicksby ridiculed him as a singing skipper, the two fought on the deck; many people on the ship felt injustice for Hicksby, and Hicksby also prepared to inflict terrible revenge on him because of his defeat in the fight. Stanley knew that things were not good, so he took a boat ashore before the ship docked. He went to his uncle's house, and a few days later, he discussed marriage with A'huang. Although A'huang agreed, she hid a layer of unexpected pain in her heart. She asked Stanley to prepare two candles on the wedding night. On the wedding night, she performed three rituals in front of the spiritual tablet with candles. Stanley felt that this kind of behavior was not good, and he couldn't sleep all night. Sure enough, the next day, when he and A'huang went out, they were immediately sniped, and A'huang was injured. "Interrupted Journey" depicts the violinist Joseph Roderick, his companions Sascha and Ivan, who died in a performance field in the summer due to a seasonal flu. In his serious illness, he was helped by his cohabiting writer Zi Lin, who cured his illness and became close friends. They took a trip. From this, we can see how well the personalities of people between China and the United States are integrated.</p>
<p>In short, although Mr. James Bennet's writing style is inevitably influenced by the realism of the twentieth century, the style is independent and there is no trace of affectation. His attitude is straightforward, and he does not elaborate on the story. By reading his novels, you can see the general life and lifestyle of European and American people in the East. Now, because of the United Nations, our close relationship is certainly even more advanced. However, friendship is not limited to formalities. We believe that Mr. Bennet's analysis and criticism of our lives is also a sincere expression.</p>
<h3>Reed Catkin Fishing Song</h3>
<p>— Hu Yaguang</p>
<h3>Preface to Translation of European Art History Outline</h3>
<p>— Tian Qin</p>
<p>This translation of nearly 200,000 words was completed at a time when the publishing industry was in a slump! I really worry whether it can be turned into printed words. Because in today's world of soaring prices and people struggling to make a living, who would be willing to invest in publishing this kind of "unpopular" work, and who would be willing to calmly read this extremely specialized and dry article?</p>
<p>At first, when I started translating, there were people who advised me, "Don't translate these things, haven't you had enough of playing with theory for half your life?..."</p>
<p>My friend's advice was well-intentioned, because he deeply knew that the sales of theoretical things were indeed a problem, which also affected its publication. He knew that I was a poor scholar who made a living by writing, and that in terms of life, it seemed that I should engage in something close to "pornography" to earn more money to maintain my life. However, I did not accept this friend's kindness and stubbornly translated it. Although it could neither be used as gold nor US dollars, when I finished the translation before the drama festival, looking at the three-inch-thick folded manuscript, I really felt unspeakable joy! My wife was copying it chapter by chapter for me, and she was also sharing my joy and congratulating me naively!</p>
<p>The original book is titled "An Outline History of Art", and the author is Joseph Pjoan, a famous professor of art lectures at the University of Chicago. He has written three volumes of Art History Outline. The first volume describes the art history of Egypt, the Near East, Greece, and Rome. The second volume describes the art history of medieval Europe, Israel, the Far East, and American natives. The third volume is my translation, which describes art from the Renaissance to modern times. Each volume can be independent, and the content is very rich. In my translation, there are nearly 300 illustrations of famous paintings, sculptures, architecture, etc. in the original book, which are not easy to see in general art history works in China.</p>
<p>My close friend Wang Chongjie went to the United States to study the navy during the Anti-Japanese War. He knew that I liked reading books on art the most. Even though he was abroad, he still remembered his old friend. He specially sent me this book from Meiya America. Because the war was raging at that time and the postal routes were blocked, it took years to reach Chongqing in June last year. At that time, I was ill (the most serious illness I had ever had), and it took a month to recover.</p>
<p>Due to extreme economic difficulties, my wife had to look for work when my body had just recovered, so she joined the Youth Army to become a female soldier (now retired). At that time, my old friend Liu Qingbo lent me an elegant room, where the food and living were convenient, and the life was relatively stable and comfortable. It happened that the organization I served (a group of ordinary people) also stopped working due to demobilization, so I spent all day engaged in translation work, which went smoothly. The translator had translated twelve chapters when he left Chongqing on November 25. In the process of translation, the most time-consuming thing was not the translation, but the research work, such as the age and place of birth of a certain painter. In order to make it clear to the readers, I almost spent as much time as translating the book to check it. In this regard, I can say that I am worthy of my dear readers. To be honest, I am a student of drama and literature. It may be that there are errors in translating such a large-scale work in another field, but I sincerely hope that readers will correct them and I am happy to accept fair criticism for correction.</p>
<p>After I arrived in Nanjing (December 2), I originally planned to translate all the remaining four chapters in a month, but I did not expect that the problem of "housing" was bothering me, so I traveled several times between Nanjing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Suzhou. Fortunately, my old friend in the cultural circle, Li Binglu, resolutely refused to give his room to the gentlemen who topped his room with "notes" and gave me a room to live in for free. This is indeed a rare friend of justice in today's world of moral depravity.</p>
<p>Although the housing problem was solved, another problem came! My workplace is in Nanjing, and my wife lives in Shanghai. If we live separately, my entire monthly income of 300,000 yuan will be divided into two halves, and neither of us will be able to survive. Because of this, I resolutely quit my job and ran to Shanghai in a daze.</p>
<p>I thought that I could realize my dream of becoming a professional writer, but I knew that in the past half month, due to gold's curse, prices have soared like wild horses, and I shudder at the prospect!</p>
<p>After the victory, my old mother repeatedly urged me to return home early to reunite the whole family. Who would have thought that the overall situation would get worse and worse, and we, as victorious citizens, would not even have the right to communicate! Of course, returning home is even more out of the question!</p>
<p>Recently, my younger brother risked coming to Tianjin, saying that the family property was gone and life was quite difficult, and he hoped that I could provide assistance from time to time. And my old mother looked south from the door all day long, with tears in her eyes. With her ancient age, her longing for her son is becoming more and more urgent. How can this situation not make wanderers feel heartbroken!</p>
<p>The translator has been in exile for ten years. Fortunately, he has not humiliated his family style. When his old mother heard about it, she often broke into tears and smiled. When will I return north? It depends on the face of the god of war. Today, when the entire book is proofread, I will dedicate this book to my kind old mother's lap and keep it as a souvenir forever.</p>
<p>Finally, I pay tribute to the publishers who published my translation regardless of cost!</p>
<p>(February 19, 1936, Shanghai on a very cold day)</p>
<h3>"Family Flag"</h3>
<p>— Translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>One Sunday Mrs. John washed several of her children's diapers and hung them on the back porch, pinning them up to let them blow in the wind. After a while, when she and Mr. John returned from church, they saw the things fluttering on the porch.</p>
<p>Mr. John stopped and asked, "Mary, what are those things on the porch?"</p>
<p>"Dear," Mary replied, "that's our federal flag."</p>
<p>"Good," said Mr. John, "let them fly forever."</p>
<h3>Remembering Su Manshu</h3>
<p>— Lu Mang</p>
<p>A friend from Hangzhou wrote several times, mentioning how the tombs of the female knight Qiu Jin and the martyr Xu Xilin were. Someone also lamented and said: The burial place of Feng Xiaoqing on Bai Causeway has been completely renewed, and the couplets can be recited vividly, but no one has asked about the poetry burial on Gushan for many years. In fact, in an era of forced smiles, it is originally about superficial embellishment, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>Among the tombs on Gushan, only Su Manshu's tomb has this relationship with me, but because of similar personalities, I especially miss Su's tomb. At this time, with the green and the spring情, I wonder what the founding poet, who passed away almost half a century ago, is fantasizing underground in the gentle east wind?</p>
<p>The title of "founding poet" is best given to Master Manshu, and the founding poet's sudden return to the Buddhist gate, looking at it today, is enlightening.</p>
<p>Manshu participated in the revolution and fled to Dongying with party members. After the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to China with party members. Others all enthusiastically ran to the political stage, but he was lonely and incompatible. Even if he talked and laughed happily with friends during the day, when the wine was over and the people dispersed, and the night was quiet and deep, he would transcend everything. Not only did he not catch up with the political enthusiasm, but he later entered the mountains for fear of not being deep enough. He is famous for being "also a hermit, also a knight, and also a writer." Joining the revolution is his "knighthood." After the success of the Xinhai Revolution and his return to China, his attitude fell into "hermitism." Why "hermitism"? There must be unspeakable secrets. Poets are not like political commentators, and they are unwilling to speak directly about national affairs. Poets originally belong to "gentleness," like Qin Shaoyou, Du Mu, and Wen Tingyun, who all turned their patriotic feelings into the feelings of lovers. Manshu became a "saint of love," "Returning you a bowl of heartless tears, regretting not meeting you before I shaved my head." After he entered the Buddhist gate, he still pretended to have these romantic feelings, expressing that he could not forget national affairs. Therefore, it is said that Manshu is a mature lover and also a truly patriotic man. He often compared himself to Dante and Byron, and his patriotism can be imagined, but he had already seen the difficulties of the country's progress and the future misfortunes, so he finally died of狂憂. It's just that he did not express the spirited and慷慨 expressions of the old men in the early Republican new dramas, nor did he have the integrity of Qu Yuan, who tied stones and投江 to create a sensational news story.</p>
<p>If we say that Manshu is a pure romanticist, why did he join the revolutionary party? If we say that Manshu has no intention of national affairs, why did he run to his motherland? Why was he so 清狂? Manshu is a warm-hearted person and a wise man. He initially joined the "Revolutionary Party" because of his warmth; after returning to China, he was so quiet because of his disappointment after observation. Some people who cannot剖析 the psychology of Dante and Byron are also unable to剖析 Manshu.</p>
<p>After all, he is a founding poet. His works are so unrestrained and畅达! However, also because of disappointment, many are哀婉动人. Mr. Zhang Mojun's poem says: "Since Qinggang is in the poetic bones, he wants to support the righteousness and arouse the soul of sorrow." When it is difficult to support the righteousness and the soul of sorrow cannot rise, poets often flow into 靡受愁苦. When we comprehensively look at Manshu's works, some are the voices of the founding of the country, and some are靡曼愁苦, which is not "good news." In him, perhaps based on his roots, or perhaps straightly revealed, but looking at it more than thirty years later, he felt uncomfortable on the day the Republic of China opened, which was truly not accidental. Talking about the "cultural people" since the founding of the country, Su Manshu is naturally the first. His wisdom, temperament, expression, words, and actions are all "cultural people." However, the characteristics of China's transformation period are precisely the characteristics of this kind of cultural people. Time is said to have passed for a long time, but compared to Manshu's era, it seems that there is no distance at all. After a ray of sunshine appeared, suddenly dark clouds gathered. Manshu, if he knew, would also be surprised that history is repeating itself.</p>
<p>History is repeating itself, but unfortunately, even poets like Su Manshu are not seen today. Is it true that each generation is worse than the last!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 194</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I think this sudden "protection" is indeed a bit strange. When we arrived in the hall, seeing that scene, it was indeed a bit irritating: the leader was indeed a woman, wearing a fashionable short cheongsam in Beiping, with a very beautiful and charming appearance, somewhat like Miss Pingzi described in Tsurumi's mouth. She was there, acting like it was a big deal, questioning the manager of this building. Behind her stood two fully armed Japanese guards. These two guys were really "阿　", I thought they looked like a pair of dung beetles; from head to toe, they were all round and round, so round that their arms spread out on both sides, unable to stick to their bodies, and each held a new German-style twenty-shot pistol in their hands.</p>
<p>Inside the hall, they have become their guard area, from inside the door to outside, lined up, all fully armed. The street entrance and the opposite street seemed to be full of murderous intent, but unfortunately the street lights were dim and the distance was far, and my pair of nearsighted eyes could hardly see clearly.</p>
<p>"Hey, quite a style, both quick-firing guns and machine guns!" Little Tiger softly told Yaoqun. This description just drew a picture of the situation on the opposite street that I couldn't see clearly.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" Tsurumi suppressed a burst of anger, his face aching, and stumbled over to participate in the Q&amp;A scene between the female leader and the general manager. He spoke a Beiping accent, with a bit of a mixed meaning, horizontally up and down, even his walking style, full of what Beiping calls "a burst of膘劲". He used Beiping dialect because the other party also had a full "Beijing accent".</p>
<p>The female leader on the other side. Just acting like it was a big deal, interrogating the general manager who was dressed in rustic clothes. Tsurumi suddenly interrupted like this, of course it was a bit strange. In order to maintain the "dignity" under the current situation, first her willow eyebrows stood up, and then her phoenix eyes stared wide; very proudly:</p>
<p>"Um...?" This "Um" means "Where did you come from, Cheng Yaojin?"</p>
<p>"Um...!" Tsurumi was in a rage, discarded the gentlemanly manners, and gathered all the丹田底气, and responded with "Um" in the same way, the timbre was very thick, and the spacious hall was shaken so that the four walls echoed continuously. This action of Tsurumi revealed a bit of rascal aura, knowing that it was to answer the woman's "Um": it seemed to be saying, "You open your dog eyes and recognize the master clearly".</p>
<p>"Who are you?" She roared.</p>
<p>"Me?... I can't take care of it for the time being, anyway, you'll know it sooner or later—isn't it superfluous to ask?—But I have to ask, what's the name of your organization, and what mission do you have here?" Tsurumi said, taking out a cigarette, and simply became a rascal.</p>
<p>This scene made me a bit confused: if the visitor is Pingzi, I am afraid that this set would not come out. If it's not Pingzi, then who is it? Maybe it's the "Manchurian female dog" that Tsurumi just mentioned upstairs? But it's a bit unlike it, because the "female dog" came to North China with Tsurumi on the same plane all the way, and a few hours of sharing the same "plane" could not be said to be "somewhat familiar". Since they seem to be familiar with each other, both sides don't seem to have this kind of challenging performance.</p>
<p>"Beiping Garrison Headquarters!" The woman smiled coldly and carried out the "Tiger Head Brand", "Coming here, on the one hand, to search for 'unstable elements', on the other hand, it is not necessary to explain to you, and you can't ask—but, I, with the current authority, order you to tell me your relationship here, your identity, and your name!" She took out the notebook and raised her voice; she added a sentence: "This headquarters has the right to arrest 'unstable' 'reactionary elements'!" She opened the notebook, holding a pen, waiting for Tsurumi to reply.</p>
<p>These few words had great strength and a rather fierce momentum, with bones wrapped in the flesh. It was a bit difficult to chew, and it couldn't be swallowed whole. It's a pity that the person involved is a woman after all, the voice is a bit sharp and crisp; in addition, the breath is also a bit thin, inevitably a bit effeminate. This is somewhat like the line in the Ping Opera when Zhang Fei drank and broke the划陵 bridge, "Fighting without fighting, retreating without retreating!" It should have been shouted as loud as thunder, but Pan Qiaoyun in翠屏山 read it out in such a dainty voice, of course it was too tasteless.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>It seems that Socrates once advised his opponent:</p>
<p>"Do you want to debate with me? Please first give a suitable definition to each term you use."</p>
<p>Confucius said: "The first essential is to rectify terms."</p>
<p>The two great philosophers of the East and West share similar views!</p>
<p>The abuse of language leads to the abuse of position, which leads to the abuse of relationships, which leads to abuse... There is a certain trajectory to follow.</p>
<p>Aunt Gu Ba kindly praised Chen Bailu as "sensual," "voluptuous," and a "masterpiece." The reason for this lies in her inability to understand the proper meaning of these terms, and therefore she cannot use them appropriately. All muddled abuse stems from people's lack of a correct understanding of the world before them.</p>
<p>I remember a certain prominent official visiting Shanghai. Impoverished university professors flocked to him, asking him to find ways to improve their lives and hoping that professors could obtain concrete living security.</p>
<p>One professor sadly cited an example, saying: "The living standard of us professors is far inferior to that of tea servers in restaurants."</p>
<p>The prominent official smiled and said very casually:</p>
<p>"Then, then you can go be tea servers."</p>
<p>The prominent official did not understand the proper status and dignity that university professors should have in a country and nation. In other words, he could not understand the proper meaning of the four words "university professor."</p>
<p>We really can't see that this prominent official is any more enlightened than Aunt Gu Ba.</p>
<p>Alas, muddled and confused; this is what is called the "status quo."</p>
<p>Many people have defined the term "philosophy." However, I particularly like Kant's saying—</p>
<p>"Philosophy is the knowledge that defines the relationship between science and life, thereby preventing the arrogance of knowledge."</p>
<p>According to his view, science and speculation do not have absolute value, but are merely means to achieve the highest purpose. Therefore, striving for morality is the highest duty of mankind.</p>
<p>In Kant's clumsy way of speaking, Newton, the philosopher of the macrocosm, had to yield the leadership of the world of thought to Rousseau, the philosopher of the microcosm. In other words, the objective study of nature is not the center of thought problems; while the subjective study of morality becomes the center of thought problems. In this way, pure reason loses its original absoluteness, and the keynote of the critical philosophy is laid.</p>
<p>Don't excessively trust your own feelings, as if they were an immutable truth. If truth is the father of the stubborn, that kind of "filial piety" is too incredible.</p>
<p>The reason seems very simple, because if everyone believes that the boundary of their own vision is the boundary of the world, this epistemological error will be unavoidable; just as the error of the eyes often makes us imagine that heaven and earth meet on the horizon.</p>
<p>Is laughter a sign of human happiness? You need to consider your own feelings.</p>
<p>Reflection is always valuable to anyone at any time.</p>
<p>"Great wisdom may appear as foolishness." What is foolishness? I think it is silent reflection. That is precisely what so-called clever people lack.</p>

<h3>Eating All the Stakes</h3>
<p>— Li Zhi</p>
<p>Over the past week, large-scale embezzlement by ticket sellers has been repeatedly discovered on the × Road tram. Judging from the actual situation, this may be a concerted action taken by ticket sellers, ticket inspectors, and drivers. During rush hour, vehicles traveling from south to east are always packed to the brim, and ticket sellers collect fares from passengers but do not issue tickets at all. The trams stop and start abruptly, driving somewhat erratically. Passengers, amidst the jolting and swaying, cannot help but worry secretly about the ticket sellers' bold act of "eating all the stakes." However, in fact, ticket inspectors seem to have long forgotten their duties, and they are never seen jumping on board, causing panic among the leisurely ticket sellers. Ticket sellers have complained to customers who envy their abundant extra income about the "huge expenses" they face. We have indeed seen ticket sellers on the last tram secretly stuffing a roll of banknotes to the driver. All this indicates that this is a planned act of corruption.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of passengers, when the tram owner's income decreases due to ticket seller embezzlement, they will inevitably increase fares, adding to our burden. In order to protect our own interests, we must of course stand up and advocate for a clean-up.</p>
<p>But why do ticket sellers embezzle and act corruptly?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, their embezzlement may be due to their meager income, which is insufficient to support their families. However, the crux of the matter is undoubtedly the influence of the widespread atmosphere of corruption. To cite a recent example, when a female principal of a certain school was exposed by a teacher for corrupt behavior, she became enraged and beat the teacher's face black and blue. Not yet appeased, she patted her chest and said, "Do you think you can sue me at the ×× Bureau? Let me tell you, everyone in the bureau, from top to bottom, is on good terms with me!" (See reports in various newspapers.) That female principal's corruption and assault were so justified simply because she and the officials, big and small, of the ×× Bureau had "eaten all the stakes" in their relationship. If a teacher is so shameless, it is no wonder that the embezzlement by ticket sellers, who have a smattering of knowledge, is becoming more and more rampant.</p>
<p>(Note: In gambling, when the house wins everything and prevents the gamblers from stopping, it is called "eating all the stakes"; but the house in gambling needs capital and takes risks; like that female principal, except for using "relationships" as capital, there is no risk.)</p>
<h3>Ticket Inspector Assaults Prosecutor</h3>
<p>— Heng Jun</p>
<p>Friends gathered, chatting about everything under the sun. The conversation turned to the incident reported in the newspaper of prosecutor Lin Houqi being assaulted by public bus ticket inspector Dong Hao. Each person expressed their opinions from their subjective standpoint, and although the discussion was inconclusive, it provided a glimpse into the concerns of the citizens:</p>
<p>Friend A: "Ticket inspectors perform their duties like prosecutors investigate cases. This dispute arose from buying a ticket past the stop, and buying another ticket would have solved it. Why resort to violence?"</p>
<p>Friend B: "A prosecutor is a law enforcement officer of the state. Taking a public bus already demonstrates a common touch. To be assaulted by a ticket inspector over a trivial matter shows the inspector's usual overbearing behavior!"</p>
<p>Friend C: "Indeed. In a city as large as Shanghai, with so many modes of transportation, similar incidents are countless. Dong was unlucky to encounter Prosecutor Lin, leading to his entanglement in the law!"</p>
<p>Friend D: "Those who work in public service are busy all day long and easily agitated. If someone disagrees with them, they retaliate immediately. Those experienced in the world avoid them."</p>
<p>Friend A: "That's not entirely true. One must know that life is for the purpose of service, and one should treat others with kindness and fairness, especially when working on public transportation. If one harbors resentment, life can be endangered immediately. Your words are tantamount to condoning him!"</p>
<p>Friend B: "The insult to the prosecutor is a small matter, but their arrogance cannot be allowed to run rampant. Dong may have acted on impulse, but the authorities should supervise and train them at all times."</p>
<p>Friend C: "The responsibility for supervision and training should not be borne by the Public Utilities Bureau, but by the labor union. Every labor union must have its purpose, and its purpose must not incite members to insult others at every turn?"</p>
<p>Friend D: "Dong has already been released on bail, and the legal issues have been investigated. Your condemnations are understandable. However, besides Dong, there are many others who are loyal to their duties, kind, and amiable. I recently witnessed a ticket seller helping women and children on and off the bus without any difficulty. Only later did I learn that he was a religious believer. The issue of training should be addressed through the influence of religious teachings."</p>
<p>Friend A: "Pedantic, pedantic! Haven't you heard, 'Even in a village of ten houses, there will be those who are loyal and trustworthy'? There are occasional virtuous people among ticket sellers; they are ultimately no match for the many who spoil things. If you don't believe me, we can set off immediately and try each bus to confirm this!"</p>
<p>Friend B: "Agreed, agreed!"</p>
<p>Friend C: "…………"</p>
<p>At this point, the hostess returned with her young child, flustered and upset. Upon asking the reason, she revealed that there were more than ten buses waiting at Nanjing Road, and when she tried to board, the ticket seller spoke rudely. When she suggested hiring a rickshaw, the other passengers supported her suggestion, and no one sympathized with her. She vowed never to take public transportation again.</p>
<p>The four looked at each other, and the conversation ended. They no longer considered conducting a field inspection.</p>
<h3>Laryngitis</h3>
<p>— Shi Jie</p>
<p>A young man, suffering from severe laryngitis, could only speak in a low voice. Passing by the clinic of a doctor who had just moved from the countryside, he decided to consult him. He rang the doorbell, and the doctor's young and beautiful wife opened the door for him. "Is the doctor home?" the young man asked in a low voice. The young wife also replied in a low whisper, "He's not here, please come in!"</p>
<h3>The Skill of Eating</h3>
<p>— Qi Lou</p>
<p>There are two meanings to the skill of eating. One refers to the size of one's appetite, and the other refers to one's ability to make a living. Considering the size of one's appetite as a skill seems unsuitable for a poor nation. However, upon closer thought, it is indeed correct. Originally, truly wealthy nations do not primarily rely on rice and wheat for their food. Only those of us who are on the verge of starvation fill our stomachs with rice for three meals a day. Using this to measure skill is both nourishing and simple.</p>
<p>As for considering the ability to make a living as the skill of eating, it is especially related to poverty. So-called making a living does not mean striving for a reasonable life for a modern person, but simply eating to survive. Once, a well-meaning student of mine said behind my back that I had the skill of eating, so I would never starve no matter where I went. Then my not-so-well-meaning wife repeated these words to me, which made me furious because I felt insulted.</p>
<p>"Hmph, he sees me as someone who just scrapes by!"</p>
<p>"Isn't being able to scrape by a good thing?"</p>
<p>"Oh, do you think that my work of literature for the sake of literature (writing poetry and novels), art for the sake of art (acting on stage), and working for social reform is just scraping by?"</p>
<p>"Being able to scrape by is already a good sign!"</p>
<p>"You see the value of life too low!"</p>
<p>"What's the difference between our lives and animals?"</p>
<p>"Do you think there are no things like science, art, music, and philosophy in the world?"</p>
<p>"All I know is that scientists, artists, musicians, and philosophers are always struggling to find food. All I know is that the children of Professor Li next door are only given a small bowl of rice per meal, and his wife cries and complains that he has no skill in eating. Besides this skill, what other skills are there, what science, art, and other nonsense are there, I don't know at all!"</p>
<p>"So, that bastard praising me for having the skill of eating is actually complimenting me!"</p>
<p>"And it's already an overstatement!"</p>
<h3>On Xiao Xiang Gui Guan—Recalling Little Male Actors of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Ting Song</p>
<p>Cheng Changgeng said: People know that acting places equal emphasis on male and female roles. For plays with paired roles, a troupe cannot succeed without a dan (female role) with high artistic skill. However, it is even more rare and valuable to find a xiao sheng (young male role) who is proficient in both civil and martial arts. Therefore, Cheng Changgeng's troupe regarded Xu Xiaoxiang as the pillar of the xiao sheng roles. In the past, the Si Xi and San Qing troupes competed with each other in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" plays. In almost every "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" play, if Zhou Yu was not paired with Xiaoxiang and Changgeng, the entire play would lose its brilliance. One day, Cheng and Xu suddenly had a minor disagreement, and Xiaoxiang left in a huff. The troupe's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" plays were suspended for a long time. Those who were experienced in watching plays blamed Cheng for being unable to tolerate others. Cheng boldly said: I can also play the xiao sheng role. He continuously performed "Taking Nan Commandery" and other "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" plays, playing Zhou Yu himself. Kongming, Lusu, and other roles were played by famous actors in the troupe such as Lu Taizi and Yu Sansheng. Sansheng was the father of Ziyun and the grandfather of Shuyan, and originally had the nickname "Living Zhuge."</p>
<p>Xiaoxiang was from Suzhou and was particularly skilled in Kunqu xiao sheng roles. Cheng could only barely play the Huangpi Gongjin. He could not play Liu Mengmei in "The Peony Pavilion" or Ji Bizheng in "Stealing Poetry." Therefore, he eventually had to ask someone to mediate and force Xiaoxiang to return to the troupe, so that they could be called a perfect match.</p>
<p>Xiao Jiao Tian valued Wang Guiguan the most. Guiguan was the pillar of the xiao sheng roles in the Tongqing troupe. Tan once said: Leng Xian's artistry, singing, acting, reciting, and fighting, all closely resemble Xiaoxiang's. This talent is not easy to come by. Wang was especially praised for playing Gongjin, and had the reputation of "Living Zhou Yu." Tan's reliance on Guiguan was not limited to Zhao Yun and Zhou Yu in the plays, which could only be played by Wang. Even Bu Zheng's Jiao Gui and Chen Daguan in "The Top Scholar" had to be played by Wang. The "Top Scholar" was especially renowned for the addition of Luo Youcui's grave keeper, known as the Three Wonders.</p>
<h3>In "Paradise Dream"</h3>
<h3>Regarding the Newspaper Industry</h3>
<p>— Qi Yuan</p>
<p>Newspaper prices have risen, making "spiritual food" even harder to enjoy.</p>
<p>Newspapers have their difficulties, knowing it's a "suicide" policy, but there's no other way, they can only walk the "Huarong Trail."</p>
<p>Some newspapers are reducing their size to cope with the current crisis. In theory, newspapers should increase in size, which is a "normal" phenomenon and a sign of "cultural" development. But now it's becoming more and more "abnormal," which is very regrettable. Some newspapers have reduced their size and laid off a large number of employees, adding a large number of unemployed people to society and increasing the severity of social and economic problems. Here, we must point out that the government's failure to provide significant assistance to the newspaper industry is a misstep.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>June 14th of the same year</p>
<p>Old Zhu lay indifferently on the most comfortable long sofa in Xu Shaoming's house, his head resting on the armrest on one side, his feet propped high on the other side, his face up, his eyes half-closed, chewing on cheap toffee made by an inland candy company. A dozen or so small square wrappers for the candy were scattered messily on the polished floor in front of the sofa.</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming's servant, A Shi, repeatedly poked his head in to look from the door of the reception room. He felt that Zhu Zhaonian was a monster of the first order. In these few days, the whole city of Guilin was busy preparing to flee. Everyone who came to find his master was there to discuss getting a ride. His master was also busy all day collecting goods and arranging transportation. Only this Old Zhu came to wait for three consecutive days, and each time he had to sit for four or five hours, supposedly to donate money to the soldiers fighting on the front line. His master always avoided seeing him, but he didn't care. If he couldn't see him once, he would come a second time, coming during the day and coming at night, as if he himself didn't want to flee.</p>
<p>A Shi was also beginning to dislike Old Zhu, especially because he kept eating candy. In half a day, the candy wrappers would be scattered all over the floor. There was still residual sugar on those wrappers, sticking to the floor, making it difficult to clean.</p>
<p>But Old Zhu said the most terrible thing today. He said:</p>
<p>"It's no use for Old Xu to avoid me! If I can't wait for him, I have a way to make him unable to leave Guilin!"</p>
<p>A Shi was loyal to his master. He had just quietly told Xu Shaoming at the front door, which really startled Xu Shaoming.</p>
<p>"511, 5271, 5144, 321712,..." The unwelcome guest in the reception room suddenly began to sing loudly. A Shi didn't understand songs at all. For more than two years, whenever he saw Old Zhu, he heard him humming like this. Hummed over and over, always these two or three sentences. Sometimes the person hadn't even come in yet, but the song had already floated in. He really suspected that Old Zhu had a mental illness. Why did he keep singing this one tune over and over?</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming happened to be rushing back, covered in sweat. In the outer courtyard, he heard Old Zhu singing the "Wedding March" non-stop, and couldn't help but frown, hesitating for a long time while standing on the cement-paved flower street.</p>
<p>"Damn it! This guy is simply trying to entangle me to death!" He cursed in his heart. "Coming seven times in three days, it's no use for me to avoid him any longer. I'm so busy these days, if I keep letting him bother me, it will inevitably delay important matters... There's no way, I'll just have to spend some money reluctantly...!"</p>
<p>He knew that once Old Zhu's stubbornness was unleashed, it was unstoppable. If he continued to avoid him, he might make even more of a scene. (Nine)</p>
