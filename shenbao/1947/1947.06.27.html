<h3>聯合國憲章簽字紀念　主席對全世界廣播　重申我國對集體安全理想</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕蔣主席爲聯合國憲章簽字二週年紀念，特於廿六日下午四時卅分至五時四十五分（南京夏令時間）對世界廣播，原詞如次二　今天是聯合國憲章在舊金山簽字的第二週年紀念日，我很願意趁此機會，從中國首都向世界愛好和平的人們，說幾句話。在過去的兩年當中，聯合國憲章內所規定的各種重要機構，都已先後成立，安全理事會，聯合國大會，經濟社會理事會和其各種委員會，以及附屬機構，他們的職責和活動，日漸增加，足見世界對於聯合國機構的信任也迅速的跟着滋長。</p>
<p>我說這句話，並不是預告大家世界的永久和平已在目前，相反的，我却很明瞭「締造和平」的艱鉅事業還在後頭，有待於聯合國公平處理的世界問題，還是很多，但是假如聯合國各委員國都肯爲了全世界的幸福，而將自己本國的利益降到次要地位，那麼這種種困難，還是有辦法的。從前在舊金山會議的時候，中國曾經很勇敢的昭告全世界，聲明我們中國進備爲了集體安全的利益，將主權之一部，委託給新國際機構，我們又說：爲了究成我們的共同目的起見，必須進備若干犧牲，我在今天，願意再向全世界聲明，我們現在還是抱定這種理想，同時我們更相信這種理想的實現，乃是聯合國成功的要素。　關於此點，全世界的人們，也許很樂意知道去年十一月間中國國民大會所通過的中國憲法，曾經在外交政策章內，特別規定擁護聯合國憲章，我相信在聯合國各委員國當中，以憲法明文規定擁護聯合國憲章的，中國還算是唯一的國家，但這並不是中國國策的根本改變，「世界大同」的理想，乃是中國的固有思想。</p>
<p>國父孫中山先生，也曾重予闡揚，作為人類文明的最終目的。</p>
<p>我在今天，更不能不很誠敬的追念我的亡友羅斯福總統，他的高尙理想，感人甚深，提前了聯合國機構的　組，羅斯福總統爲人類服務的功績，是値得我們紀念的，我覺得最好的紀念辦法，莫過於大家一齊努力，使我們的聯合國成為一個永遠存在，永遠生長的機構。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕中央廣播電台頃收聽紐約聯合國憲章簽字二週年紀念特別節目中轉播之蔣主席講演，語昔甚爲淸晰，先爲原詞，次播英文譯詞。按行政院新聞局曾於十五日恭請主席講演濯片，航寄美國，並由該局與交通部合辦無綫電拍發英文譯詞至美。同時由新聞局之英文廣播電合播送至美國加州都拉錄音站收音灌片，轉送至紐約廣播電台，故播送全球至爲迅速圓滿。</p>
<p>朱家驊向友邦呼籲　共守信義促進和平</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕廿六日爲聯合國日，聯合國中國同志會理事畏朱家驊，於晚六時至八時在國際聯歡社舉行鷄尾酒會，藉申慶祝，到各院部會首長與大學校長及美·英·法·印·蘇等國使節與代辦百餘人，情緒歡洽熱烈，朱氏並假中央廣播電台以中·英文向國內外廣播，呼籲友邦共守信義，擁護聯合國憲章，以促進世界和平。</p>

<p>〔本報天津廿六日電〕津浦北段國軍未繼續推進，爲確保馬廠，堿河以北，南運河以東地區安全，以拱衛津市，決於馬廟碱河及南運河沿岸修建碉堡，加强防務，津浦北段戰事，頃已告一段落。</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿六日電〕津浦北段共軍回竄平漢北段後，國軍已源源開往增援，據報：共軍爲阻擾國軍調動，正計劃積極破壞交通。</p>
<h3>王寵惠發表對時局意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊）國府委員王寵惠博士，昨對記者發表對時局問題之意見稱，日前孫副主席談話，頗可代表全國國民之思想。中蘇誼屬毗鄰，理應友好，况兩國之外交政策，亦均以世界和平爲鵠的，但兩國邦交之增進，必須由雙方共同努力，不能專責一方。以中蘇條約論，我國簽訂此約原係抱最大決心，並作最大犧牲，目的無非希望兩國永久友好，迄今我國遵循此項條約，並無絲毫違背，自有權要朮蘇聯以同樣之精神，履行條約規定之義務。關於美國對遠東政策，最低限度，亦應與對歐洲政策同樣積極，並予中國以不斷之援助。美英當必明暸，中蘇條約之簽訂，本係淵源於英美蘇之雅爾達密約，我國所以忍受犧牲，原冀遠東和平，得以維持。美英兩國必須自知其責任所在，對中國局勢，不應袖手旁觀，否則，實非道義上所能容許，故我國此時，應即要求美英兩國參與共同謀求中蘇間一切問題公平合理的解決。</p>
<h3>張君勵談話　簧成中蘇友好條約　但盼能獲忠實履行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨昨日午後三時於愚園路總部召開臨時中常會，出席常委十人，由張君勱主席，至六時許始散會，討論之內容不明。會後張君勱招待記者，有詢以對孫副主席最近之談話有何感想？張氏答謂：「中蘇條約簽訂時本人亦爲贊成者之一，今日希望此協定能忠實履行。中蘇問問題，希望政府　循外交途徑，開誠佈公與蘇聯談判解決」。關於美國貸款事，張氏認爲五億美元可望成功，目前正在洽商之中，「只需我國改良政治，提高生產，剷除貪汚，則美國之援華不成問題」。並謂：「參政會之和平建議，政府已接受，實際辦法正研究中。此時不致對中共下討伐令，如政府下令討伐，則民社黨將表示明確態度」。張氏並表示：希望內　能及早停止，目前聯總要求黃河兩岸雙方停戰，以便築堤一點，關係百萬生命，尤應接受。有誨以對海外黨員最近之要求，是否接受一節，張氏謂：「上月召開之組織委員會，完全合法。海外代表之缺席，與大會之法定人數無關。故重開組織委員會之建議，不能接受」。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕民盟各要員已先後自京返滬，定今日上午九時召開中常會，研究當前之局勢。据發言人表示：會後是否正式發表談話，尙未決定。</p>
<h3>外蒙提出覆文掩飾犯境行動</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿六日電〕關係方面獲悉，外蒙政府於本月廿二日由其駐莫斯科公使，將對我政府前所提出抗議之覆文，交予傅秉常大使。該項覆文，並於廿四日由我駐蘇大使館電達外交部。据悉其內容要點爲外蒙政府認北塔山事件係起因疆界糾紛，外蒙政府認爲北塔山「在外蒙疆界內」，中國軍隊曾「侵入」外蒙疆界，因此引起衝突云。此間觀察家認爲外蒙是項曲解事實，强詞掩飾其犯境行動之聲明，將令北塔山事件之解決，增加困難。又蘇聯及外蒙對我提出抗議之覆文，先後送抵南京後，外交當局正在縝密研究與考憲中。</p>
<h3>追悼張靈甫將軍</h3>
<p>京徐各地分別發起</p>
<p>〔本報鎭江廿六日電〕國軍七十四師師長張靈甫將軍，在沂蒙山區壯烈殉職後，南京·徐州·鎭江·淮陰之張氏戚友，刻正分別發起舉行追悼會，又聞中樞以七十四師官兵，不屈不撓，突圍而出，至可嘉許，已令集中某地整訓待命。</p>

<h3>顧大使與馬卿會談　討論我經濟情勢　五億貸款尙待最後決定</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿五日電〕我駐美大使顧維鈞，二十五日下午與馬歇爾會談歷一小時之久。據顧民稱，會談主題為「中國經濟　情勢之各方面」。顧氏會後告記者稱，渠與馬卿曾就美國將來援華之各種可能性，予以檢討，惟顧並朱提及則將於六月三十日滿期之美進出口銀行五億美出口銀行。顧氏並稱：中國需要兩種貸款：一為長期貸款，以促進中國之經濟復原及建設，另一為短期貸款，以稱定中國目前經濟情勢。今日會談時，美國務院遠東司司長范宣德亦在座。</p>
<p>〔又電〕美國務卿馬歇爾今日聲稱，國務院現正逐日審愼注意整個中國局勢，但渠對是否將採取任何行動，以展延指設中國之進出口銀行五億美元貸款之限期（六月三十日屆滿），則表一懷疑。（按此項指定之貸款，必須在限期前動用）馬卿此語係在今晨例行記者招待會中答復某記者發問而作者。該記者提醒馬卿謂：業已指定但未動用之對華貸款，將於下週一滿期，因此是否將採取任何行動？馬鄉于是發表上述簡單之意見，但未作詳細說明，亦未透露渠逐日與其商談者，所注意之細節爲何。渠稱，展延對華貸款限期之任何新行動，必須由負責國際貸幣及財政問題之全國顧間委員會處理之，但經向財政部查核後，獲知展延對華貸款限期之問題，迄今尙未提交顧問委會考慮。自此間一般人之觀念加以推測，對華貸款將任其在美政府規定之限期失效。比即倘若中國需要美國之財政援助，則須重新開始談判新貸款，美全國顧問委會爲最高之專家組織，其對政府所指撥之外國貸款，有最後決定之權。顧問委會主席爲財政部長史奈　，馬卿代表國務院，哈里曼代表商務部，馬丁代表進出口銀行，艾科斯代表聯邦準備局。我駐美大使顧維鈞廿五日下午三時與馬卿舉行會商。按進出口銀行指撥之貸款，乃依照逐項計劃之基礎，對中國政府各機關及私人企業作可能之其他信用貸款。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕財長史奈德廿五日在此間記者招待會上稱：進出口銀行指定貸給中國之五億元借款，其保留期限，將於六月三十日滿期，並未者慮予以展延或在滿期以前貸給中國。按史奈德乃決定美國政府對外貸款政策之國家顧問委員會主席，其決　須經絕統作最後決定。</p>

<h3>全國經會重要決議　經濟改革方案先交付審查　國營事業估價限下月完成</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿六日電〕全國經濟委會於廿六日午後舉行第五次會議，以大部份時間討論張院長所提經濟改革万案。張院長報告提出該案經過後，即由陳立夫說明要點，特別强調目前雖為非常時期，然不能因其爲非常時期而不作根本之圖，此一方案並非治標辦法，而為根本計劃，在目前情况下，設不如此，恐難有濟。陳氏指出：過去金融界有一不良風氣，即「不管晨業，數衍工業，帮助商業」，馴致三者咸不能順利發展。此項不良風氣應加糾正。俾工農能彌金融之調劑而發盛。報告畢，各委員紛紛發言，有贊成者，有懷疑者，亦有主張加以修改者。一般成認此一方案原則甚佳，然實行時應由何處下手，須待斟酌。在此幣制不定之時，實行後能否奏效，亦値得懷疑。若干委員則認目前爲過渡時期治本治標以同時並進為宜。最後決定由陳立夫，徐堪為召集人，於日內舉行全體審查會，對此方案作進一步縝密研討，預計至少將開會三四次，再交大會或分組審議。</p>
<p>今日會中，除討論上述問題外，對國營事業佔價標準，亦曾有所決定，要點為：今後估價，根據當前物價，參照下列四點，以爲標準：（一）原料供應情形，（二）單位所在地，（三）業務發展情形，（四）市塲需要，並決定「加緊估價，限期七月內完成」。</p>
<p>會中對黃金自由買賣事，亦曾討論。政完交議之全國銀樓業所請求之修改經適濟緊急措施方案中有關銀樓業管理辦法案，會中僉認（一）在目前情况下，無此必要，（二）銀樓業顧名思義，應以經營銀業爲主，（三）因此失業人數並不如所傅之多。泆議，原辦法不予變更。</p>
<p>又關於簡化稽征事，徐柏園曾有報告，張院長認若不影響稅收，暫可辦理。</p>
<p>今日會議由張院長主席，出席委員孫隆吉，李敬齋，黃元彬，王曉籟，樓桐孫，潘序倫，薛篤弼，左舜生，翁文瀰，簡貫三，吳蘊　，劉健羣，徐堪，王雲五，劉振東，陳立夫，鄧飛黃，陳方，蕭錚，谷正綱等。自下午三時開始、至七時半始畢。下次會議定七月三日舉行。</p>
<h3>立院法制經濟等委會　審查郵電加價案　交部希望郵費漲五倍</h3>

<p>〔本報西安廿五日電〕縣參會議長竟遭縣長親率縣府武力圍宅槍殺之陝南鎭安縣駭人血案，昨晨八時長安地方法院首次公審，旁聽席雖已擴充，仍水浪不通，法官與血案主角即前該縣長孫濬伯，同樣汗下如雨。昨竟日開調查庭，律師十五人全體出席，孫及被書人證人先後受審，各方供詞均有漏洞，數日內將續審。該案檢察管所控告罪名，一為孫强迫女敎師王慧敏同居之妨害風化自由罪，王於四月中毒身亡，惟其父控孫毒死一點，檢察官尙未承認。二爲槍殺四人致死罪，緣該縣參議會屢次檢舉孫會汚不法，王案揭發，孫更疑由該會鼓動，遂於五月二日先揑報共黨潛入，宣告戒嚴，再率隊槍殺議長李維翰及秘書勤務等三命於李宅，復怖置槍警，追殺證口一人於城外。三為扣押送電報往李宅之電信局職員達十餘日之妨害自由罪。首二項檢察官認利用職權，力主加重論罪，但有人推測孫具有利證據，加以其他原因，故或不致判死。陝十餘縣參議會紛通電，力促嚴辦，陜監察使亦已檢舉此案。</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>美國應作的決策</h3>
<p>本埠英文大美晚報於廿一日發表了一篇「誰放棄了誰？」的社論，全篇大意：『中國並未爲美國所放棄，但是中國未能用健全的商業原理獲致美國的援助，反而放棄了美國。以美國進出口銀行五億貸款而論，該行儲款以待，數月於茲，究其原因，乃由於從各方面看來，可知中國寗願取得一種「政治借款」，無須由借款人管制此種款項之用途，而不願潛心計算爲全國所眞正需要者，以擬就一種健全而有益的訐劃，有以致之。』這一篇社論，原可視爲他山之石：就是在中國政府當局，也未始不可藉此有所反省。但是該報又說：『如若彼輩承認外國援助今後不能盲目畀予，如若彼輩認爲中國人民對於外國政治貸款不能產生良好結果而感覺無望；則事尙有可爲；但若彼輩出以啼兒及乞丐之行爲，則其結果，唯有遭致失敗，並將遭受其本國人民之不願出此者之鄙視。』這一段文字，不僅視中國要求美國予以援助，純出於自私的動機，而且對於中國常前的政治，頗多誤會之處，故本報二十二日社論「美國應早作明智的抉擇」一文，除了指出遠東局勢發展到此稈度，已使美國未來的對華政策，不得不在全力援助與完全放棄中國二者之間，作明智的抉擇了；同時並糾正大美晚報對於中國政治所有不正確的觀點。殊不料該報於廿五日又發表了一篇社論，題爲「美國必須援助或退出乎？」對於本報社論，頗多誤會與歪曲之處，自不能保守緘默，不得不重言加以說明之：</p>
<p>第一，我們要求美國政府對於遠東，作明智的抉擇，並非出於威嚇的態度。對美國說：若不以全力援助中國，我們就要美國完全退出。大美晚報對於這一點，首先就誤會了，這或許是翻譯者的錯誤。所以大美晚報發問：中國對於美國，因其重商而不重義，有無發起要求美國退出中國的運動？這一個問題，我們認爲是多餘的，至少在目前，中國人民的心目中，並沒有絲毫反美的情緒；中美兩國的邦交，一向是非常友好密切；在抗戰之前，中國受了帝國主義的壓迫與侵略，陷於次殖民地的地位，唯有美國對於中國沒有政治的領土的野心，不僅同情中國，而且處處以平等的地位待我，列强在中國的均勢也是完全靠了美國堅決推行其所謂「門戶開放」，「中國領土主權完整」等政策。迨至中國抗戰軍興，美國首先譴責日本的侵略暴行，並堅持其「不承認主義」：後來太平洋戰爭爆發，中美兩國乃成爲同生共死的盟國，中美兩國經過這一番血的洗鍊之後，也就成爲患難之交，兩國關係自然更加密切了。故在大戰結束之後，中國爲了共產黨的問題，接收復員遣送敵俘，都遭遇到極大的障礙，美國仍一秉其友好的精神，協助中國復員及遺送日俘：同時馬歇爾元帥爲了中國的和平統一，竟不辭辛苦，特地前來中國，担任調人，在一年之內，奔走和平，席不暇暖，在炎炎的暑天，曾八上匡廬，雖未能使中國化于戈爲玉帛，但是馬帥的辛勞，深深地印在每一個中國人民的心底，永遠不能淡忘，共產黨雖然幾次三番，企圖煽動人民反美，但共結果，無有不歸於失敗者，足見中美兩國人民在友誼上的聯繫，已不是任何力量所能破壞的了。本報社論，也無時不鼓吹中美合作，以促進兩國在政治上經濟上文化上的關係。第二，大美晚報始終認爲，美國不肯以貸款畀予中國，由於中國內政的不修明，該報曾載稱：『有人以爲美國對於歐洲各國採取杜魯門主義，而對於繼續援助中國採取「冷淡」態度，此種看法，不啻汚辱美國，其實美國對於中國深爲關切，但不以共產主義爲限，而且對於美國所承認之政府，對於共產主義，匪特不能作眞正有效之反對，抑且有時不免採取共產黨之集權及排外策略，此事尤爲關切。中國應多考慮杜魯門主義之第二章，此卽馬歇爾國務卿之經濟援歐計劃是，此一步驟，亦為美國人欲施行於中國者也，美國進出口銀行五億貸款，辯論已多，究有何種意義可言乎？但截至目前為止，中國尙無法取得此項貸款。』大美晩報在滬發行，已有悠久的歷史，其主持人亦在華多年，且在美國向有「中國問題專家」之稱，每日所發表關於中美關係的社論，向爲我國朝野所重視，但是我們在閱讀之餘，終不免有「外國人的看法不同」之感。大美晚報對於中國當前的政治，實應正視現實，尤應諒解中國政府所處的環境，更不能忽視了我國大多數人民的感情與願望。政治的優劣，向無絕對標凖，無論如何，中國今日的政治與希土等國此較，我們決不承認在他國之下。大美晚報誤解中國政治的論斷，使我們不能不引爲遺憾。</p>
<p>第三，以中美邦交而論，在大戰之後，中美關係日益密切，兩國文化的交流，更為通暢，論理在中美兩國之間，不容再有隔閡與誤會，尤其是在滬多年的美國報紙。我們早已在社論中一再指出，中國要求美國予以援助，決非出於自私的動機，但是中國需要美國援助，却是世界大局客觀條件所形成的。馬歇爾國務卿昨已宣佈，五億貸款的限期至本月底屆滿，不再展延，中國決不願意向美國迄取「嗟來之食」，當另有「自力更生之道」。但是美國不援助中國的後果，是値得美國朝野注意和考慮的。我們雖不致要求或迫令美國完全退出，但是美國推行現行政策的結局，不問其願意與否？終有不得不完全退出的一天。誠如孫副主席稱：『美國反響冷淡，卽等於對中國放棄。』所以我們相信：美國如有遠見的政治家，不斤斤於打商人輜銖必計的算盤，則對於危機迫於眉睫的遠東局勢，必能有新的決策。身在遠束的美國記者，親身目暏遠東局勢的日趨嚴重，自應抱超然的態度，不偏不倚，將實在的情形，以及當地人民的感觀，報導美國人民，並作及時的呼籲，以喚起美國人民的注意，這樣才能盡新聞記者的職責！</p>

<h3>英法蘇會商馬卿計劃　外長會議今揭幕　貝文莫洛托夫飛抵巴黎　史奈特謂美元經濟援歐肯定義務</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿六日電〕英外長貝文與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫今日各自本國後先飛抵此間，將於明日與法外長皮杜爾會商美國務卿馬歇爾援助歐洲復興計劃。與英氏同來者有蘇聯駐法大使布哥莫洛夫。英法人士均認爲蘇聯同意討論馬歇爾計劃乃一種足資激勵之徽兆，但莫斯科眞理報昨日之尖刻批評，則使過去樂觀者略感沮喪。波蘭表示關切馬氏計劃亦頗重要，因波蘭煤斤乃任何歐洲復興計劃中一大因素。同時，美國在英法蘇三國外長會議前夕進一步向歐洲保證，決爲馬氏計劃之後盾。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿五日電〕財政部長兼國家顧問委員會主席史奈特今日在記者招待會中表示馬歇爾計劃並不使美國對歐洲或世界任何其他部份有從事財政援助之肯定義務。史氏答記者之問題時謂：國家顧問委員會（總統之顧問機構決定對外國貸款之計劃）並未擬且計劃，以實行馬歇爾之援助計劃。詢以馬歇爾是否欲邀歐洲國家於必要時聲請此項援助，答曰，並無此意。史奈特之言已引起一般之驚異。查馬歇爾在哈佛大學之演說，並釆述及美元援助，僅日美國之任務爲在「友好地協助草具歐洲計劃，然後再視實際情形之需要，交特此一計劃」。若就馬鄉此言于以嚴格之解釋，則史奈特之言不失爲有理。惟再以其後其他國務院官員之言論爲據—如國務院法律參事高恩之日美國或將於今後四年內不得不核准貸款三百億元—則美國及歐洲之人士皆認馬易爾原來之建議，乃一雖附有條件但屬肯定之義務。史奈特今日招待記者　復曰：「余對馬易爾之方之解釋，乃為馬易爾　為邀請歐州國家從事自力復興，並觀察彼等能對自己有如何之作爲。」記者於是乃詢史奈特曰：「然則閣下以爲在馬歇爾之言中，美國並未建議從事任何援助歟？」史氏答曰：「吾人除已知者外，尙無其他證據可資證明曾有此項建議。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕財政部長史奈特為闡明早晨招待記者會上所發表之談話，復於午後接見各訪員，加以解釋曰：余對馬歇爾計劃之見解，認為共並元邀請其他國家覓取美國經濟援助之意，此言並非余對馬歇爾復興歐洲之建議，表示異議之謂，要知馬歇爾國務卿在哈佛大學所發表之演說，乃謂美國可進而援助歐洲。使其走上復興之途，但先需歐洲各國對於其基本需要獲致協調，定一適當　礎，然後向美國申請援助。余認為此係表示歐洲先行盤查其存貨，自行發展。余適在招待記者會中所言，即係申述此一解釋，表明復興歐洲或需要美國援助之意而巳云。</p>
<h3>三國舉行初步討論　其他國家暫不參加</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：英蘇法三國外長行將於廿七日開始會議，商討馬歇爾援歐計劃，其他國家之代表亦參加會議，此際尙談不到。但至三國外長會議擬就工作計劃之後，可能先行諮詢其他國家之意見，然後始能將歐洲經濟復興計劃作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕波蘭一駐法大使特拉曼本日前往法國外交部訪問外次繆維爾，告以渠即將奉令負責爲波蘭參加三國外長會議安排一切，波蘭對於馬歇爾援歐計劃，甚爲關切云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕此間捷克外交界人士談稱：捷克大使館參贊哈思曾於本日赴國務院訪晤經濟帮辦桑爾普，告以捷克斯洛伐克對馬歇爾計劃感覺興趣，當時桑爾普會力言：（一）此項計劃并不拒絕任何國家：（二）第一步歐洲國家先應負責獲致協調，此乃此項計劃成功之必要條件。惟哈恩并未告知桑爾普捷克斯洛伐克欲加入此項計劃之意，僅表明捷克之具有興趣而已。關於波蘭大使表示願意加人一事，此殆由於波蘭所受之戰爭破壞，甚於捷克，故急需援助云。</p>

<h3>眞理報評論　馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿五日電〕莫期科電合廣播「眞理報」所載一文稱：馬歇爾計劃倘爲反共繩索，則必爲歐洲各「自尊」國家所拒絕，但英國今有不得蘇聯之參加，亦準備向前進行之象徵。倘馬歇爾計劃，一以美國援助希土計劃爲原則，則必注定失敗。馬歇爾計劃之一般性質不詳，致蘇聯無從判明其是否志在解決歐洲間題，抑爲佈置資本主義與共產主義間之意識戰爭。此次巴黎會議乃以決定蘇聯合作之程。度爲主要任務。倘馬歇　　劃仍與援助希土計劃如出一轍，而屬反共性質，則此項援助即爲干涉歐洲國家內政及其主權之謂，故歐洲各國凡具有自尊心者，當將加以拒絕云。</p>
<h3>對史奈特談話　法方反響</h3>
<p>〔合家社巴黎廿五日電〕據華盛頓電訊，美財長史奈特招待記者時會謂，馬歇爾計劃並非定爲美國將以更多援助給予歐洲之謂，此間外交界對此殊有莫明其妙及難以置信之感。此間外交界認爲史氏之用意，在於計算該計劃之經費前，撫慰美國民意而已。但據此閒某官員談稱：「史氏所言如果屬實，或可使三强會議及整側計劃未及實行而即夭折。」</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京廿六日電〕前上海科學研究會會員小宮吉高博士頃在本期「新中國」雜誌撰文，倡言美國將援助日本經濟復興，日本則將援助中國之經濟復興。據稱：日本之援華，其理由有三：（一）日本在應用科學方面較中國更爲進步。（二）中國歷來派遣留學生赴日，有時多至三萬人，大部份研究法律，政治，經濟與實用科學如醫學等。中國留學生赴日，因無力赴歐之故，彼等認爲日本乃遠東的西方科學與文化基地。（三）日本不僅在華投有巨額資本，建立鐵路，工廠，礦山，及輪船公司，且曾派遣大批專家，使此種事業進行。日最最重要之投貴　　　　。</p>
<p>中國轉野充分認職日本科學對中國文化發展與進步之重大任務，日本在平洋戰爭中失敗，並未使中國人停止期望日本之領導。將來中國重建經濟而發現迫切需要技術上的援助時，勢必呼召日本專家協助。</p>

<h3>社會局前紛擾　兩幫工人惡鬥　二區針織業手搖組工人請願波折　多人受傷十一人被拘</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全市一二三區針　　手搖機組男女職工一萬餘名，前爲指數糾紛，與資方發生爭執。一三兩區職工旋與資方獲得協議，惟二區迄未解決，工人罷工已有多日。昨日二區工人爲該區工會理事長鄭芳雄於前晚突然失踪，結隊向總工會社會局市政府請願，沿途與一區工會理事長王思本及理事潘林弟等發生衝突，雙方互有受傷。</p>
<p>針織業去年因營業淸淺，勞資變方商定當月工資依上月指數八五折發給。嗣指數於五月起解凍，五月份工資一三兩區勞資雙方同意按照協議依凍結指數七九四，五倍加十一萬七千元差額金及米一斗發給。二區工人則要求遵照社會局批定依四月份假定指數一萬四千八百倍八五折發給。二區資方表示不能接受，申請仲裁，五月份工資遲遲未發，工人乃罷工。一三兩區工人因已獲協議，照常工作，三工會間因之發生不睦。</p>
<p>昨晨十一時二區工會集合一千餘人至總工會請願，散發宣言，聲稱該會理事長郟芳雄因遭資方之忌，於二十五日晚九時，被自稱東南日報記者之馮　華及中國通訊社記者之徐，永傑約赴祥生飯店四一九號房間，一去不返突告失踪。後查祥生飯店並無該號房間，東南日報等亦無該兩記者，顯係冒名欺騙，秘密逮捕，故要求當局澈查。當彼輩抵達總工會時，負責人適不在，乃轉往社會局請願。途徑長　襪廠，遇一區工會理事潘林弟，雙方言語發生衝突，乃起毆打，潘手胸等處受傷。嗣又在中華路途遇一區工會理事長王思本，亦起衝突。王平時佩有手槍，雙方發生爭執時，王指請願工人搶奪手槍，工人則指王持槍恫嚇，王卒以勢寡，被請願　衆挾持，同赴社會局請願。王友二十餘人聞訊趕往救援，雙方在社會局門首又起毆鬥。一區方面當有王思本，潘林弟等受傷，二區方面據工會稱，有七人被小刀剌傷，傷勢頗重，其他尙有數人輕傷。嵩山警局聞訊，派警到塲彈壓，一面將傷者軍送醫院救治。時社會局因勞工處負責人不在，允至次日答覆。工人乃又轉往市政府請願，吳市長公出，由沈秘書長接見，囑於今晨派代表晉謁市長。</p>

<h3>吳市長關注物價　對記者發表談話　決撲滅金鈔黑市　再澈查倉庫存紗　鮮肉零售價今日可議定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來本市物價又有醞釀波動現象，吳市長甚爲關心，特於昨日下午四時半，在市府會議室接見各報社記者，對於取締金鈔黑市，澈查倉庫存紗，盡量增加配米，及抑平鮮肉價格等分別報告具體辦法如下：</p>
<p>自經濟偵察團於最近宣告結束，將工作交由市府接辦後，一般投機份子咸認爲市府對偵查取締工作容或鬆懈，故暗中紛紛進行交易，致黑市直綫上漲，事實上市府對取締黑市工作，決以全力進行，動員市府警察局，社會局全體高級人員，並會同財政部，中央銀行設法澈底撲滅金鈔黑市。現已決定辦法兩點：（一）希望市民儘量檢舉，密告者之姓名，市府決嚴守秘密。（二）密告人之獎金，迅速發給，以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>嚴懲棉紗投機增加配米數量</p>
<p>棉紗問題，亦頗重要，市府將與紡織事業調節委員會隨時取得密切聯繫。為遏止投機，決進行第二次倉庫澈查，若有　縱囤　　　，當予</p>
<p>本市民食調配會成立以來，配米數量，每月均有增加，下月份可較本月份再增加若干，八月份以後，每月可配米三十萬祖，故食米問題，絕無恐慌。</p>
<p>本市蔬菜價格，於端午節近時上漲頗多，現已稍告回跌，市府對此極爲注意，務求做到控制市價。本市猪肉之批售價格爲每斤七千元，而零售價竟達一萬一千元，殊不合理。吳市長昨會召鮮肉業及肉行業公會負責人談話，令鮮肉業公會於今日召開會員大會，議定零售價格，絕對遵守。今後鮮肉到滬後，應立即出售，違者嚴予取締。</p>
<p>物價上漲八成報載絕非事實</p>
<p>吳氏報告完畢後，即有記者詢以各項問題，經吳氏答覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）據英文大美晚報稱：本市本月物價，上漲達八成確否？吳氏答稱：絕非事實，可以米棉作爲例證。（二）經濟偵察團結束後，市府是否將另立機構專司其職？吳氏稱：無此必要，將由市府參事，專門委員等高級職員參加工作。工作之分配，將提今日之市政會議中討論之。（五）民食調配會之開辦費八千萬元，經常費二億元，迄今僅配出食米二萬石，似不甚經濟，是否改善辦法？吳氏答稱：調配會已配出之食米，實有四萬担，今後將陸續求其增加。該會因係初辦，致手續上有遲緩現象，且配米者往往提米時拖延時日，現已囑社會局吳局長令米商提米，限三日之內提淸，過期作自動放　　，以求迅速。</p>

<h3>建國捐開徴地點　大城市較為合理</h3>
<p>奚玉書發表意見</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕奚王書氏頃對建國捐之擬議開征，發表意見如下：建國捐在大城市征收，甚爲合理，因在小城市內之財　價値，到達起稅點者不多。惟征收之技術，如何使其公平合理，殊爲困難。首先我國過去並無財產登記，今辦理於匆促之間，甚難完善。財富中如金條證券等，均有法隱匿逃稅，如純以不動特為對象，旣欠公平，而此種財產之收益，恐已不足支付現有稅捐，再使其負担建國捐，顯有問題。至於由民意機關提出應納建國捐之名單，實行時亦不易。因確定一人是否殷富，除少數特殊情形外，至困為難。</p>

<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕（上）劉君所提兩點，均爲合於法定條例之主張，其第二點尤爲有力，（二）如判決結果，屋被收回，自不能繼續租賃，否則租貨關係，繼續存在。（三）不承認二房東資格，三房客地位何在，（四）未付租金之原因，如因拒絕收受，應有確切證明。</p>

<p>〔秦聯奎律師答〕（一）法律上無童養媳之規定。（二）自動出走與父母無涉。（三）結婚不能強迫。（四）如爲防止侵害，自非違法，但如另有別情，又作別論，惟十九歲尙未成年，正規途徑，應仍返受父母監護。（五）父母所收聘金，由父母償還。</p>

<h3>棉紗續漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開塲中業外人納意仍强，本街染織廠及長江帮需求不寂，市勢續昂。四二支藍鳳紗激昂至二千萬元間。近收時聞股票回降，浮多獲利吐售，價即盤小，結果爲一千九百五十萬元，比上日仍漲九十萬元。其餘三十二支及二十支十六支等粗細各紗，亦一致扯三四十萬至一百萬元不等。</p>

<h3>棉花市況穩定　成交數比昨稍遜</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，上午因紗價疾升，港申電匯再縮，人心極度高昻，喊價甚亂，買方以連日市價已趨高峯，吸胃稍懈，交易極少。午後因棉紗收盤稍疲，黑市匯率聞亦回小，人心廠軟。賣方不再扳價，紗廠略有吸胃，同業互有進出。但市價仍難回小，脚地趨穩定之勢，市况與上日相同，價格似見稍好，成交數比上日稍遜。各檔做開送廠價計靈寳二一五萬至二二齡萬，漢細一七九萬，又棧交價計漢細一七五萬至一八二萬，冲紗市一七七萬，火機一四六萬至一四八萬，南太倉一四八萬。</p>
<h3>糖市趨勢混亂</h3>
<p>秘魯砂停止棧單交易</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢混亂，仍不脫堅緊之象。秘魯砂因有皮球交易，市塲停止棧單進出，以免助長漲風。現貨約六十六七萬元，二四粗白棧單六十二萬五千元，現貨六十六七萬元，二〇中砂白五十七萬五千元至五十六七萬元。四半車白六十二萬元至六十五七萬元。三半車白六十萬元，合赤四十九萬元，五十萬元至五十一萬元。土糖興化由高五十四萬元，次五十二三萬元。興赤四十二三萬元，計四五百　。汕提靑三十八九萬元，計有數十包。刁靑白包三十四五萬元，普通三十三萬元，計一二百包。海南白四十包，五十萬元。</p>

<p>外股昨以港申電慘縮至九元半左右，銀行帮錢兌業有納，而前衆集公所西人獨　怡紗頗多，廣帮及證券都有供。怡紗晨開八四〇〇〇元高價達十萬元大關，而後略回，在九三〇〇〇元徘徊。結果較前收計怡紗會　　　業英聯各升一成左右，　植電話航　各漲半成，業廣升二成，紙業怡　各漲二成有零。</p>
<h3>大戶買胃仍健　華股市況恍惚　遞永紗曾出萬元關</h3>
<p>華股昨大戶賣胃仍健，是以上塲時雖因遞交證金，院令須征五成現金之打擊，而現疲軟，但中途在金匯黑市飛躍之刺激下，永紗仍易再創新高價，永公且達漲限，中絲亦然。惟浮多過多，塲外息價再開高至四角半，塲內套利達七二〇元，臨收前回跌亦快。大勢漸趨恍惚，前途難免盤旋。</p>
<p>晨初因報載院令遞交展期三月，惟證金須五成現金之訊，人心見怯而開低盤。開後遞永紗由二二四號二二號一七九號一二九號一九七號進至九六八〇元，二三五號八九號一五八號六一號賣出，一四號七六號更賣現永紗，一度迫低至九四〇〇元內，一五四號七六號二一二號買胃尙健，九七號亦納現永紗，升爲九六〇〇元外。一五五號七六號一八六號八三號二四號脫手，三二號九四號賣出現永紗，遞交再低至九四〇〇元，二二八號五四號三六號一七一號進至九六〇〇元外，而由一八五號二四號一三四號賣出現永紗，一〇六號亦有了結，再降至九四八〇元。金鈔暗盤狂躍一五七號一九七號六一號八三號三六號二一二號一二二號五六號一二號二二四號急切爭買，九七號舊購現永紗，同時復有　交證金自十五億存帳採累進制之說，遞永紗終於穿出萬元大關。永公由農帮一六二號等收購，遞交漲停，中絲亦然，遞永紗由七六號三六號一六三號六一號三二號進至一〇一〇〇元，現九五〇〇元新高價。一四〇號二三四號九四號八三號一九七號賣到九八〇〇元內，一二號一二三號三六號尙進，一八〇號九七號仍進現永紗，而再迫萬元大關。塲外貼息開高至四角零五及四角半，塲內亦達七二〇元高價，二一八號二二四號一五七號一六〇號一五五號一八三號二三五號八九號六五號一一七號二一七號連袂脫手，回小至九六〇〇元。一五七號三二號雖進至九七〇〇元外，港申電自九元四升至九元八紗價回瀉甚多，八九號九四號三六號一五五號八三號二二三號一一二號等斬多，遞交跌至九四〇〇元，即交八七五〇元低價。一七一號一九六號六一號進至九七五〇元，二二號四七號三一號尙售，而以九六五〇元收市。收後遞永紗經二二四號買進，喊高至九八〇〇元。結果較前收即交各股計永紗景福徽挫，永公漲半成强，美亞信和新光中法動興各跌半成强，　　新飛跌一成左右，中絲漲停後有回，與水泥同漲一成，統益火榮麗安各升半成强，新亞平平，景綸徽降，國貨跌半成强，餘均微升。遞交各股計永公漲停，永紗美亞新光景福勤興微升，華豐小挫，塲外各老股計南洋閘北大生均挫，五洲微升，餘均平定。</p>
<p>套利交易</p>
<p>現遞套利交易，息價自一角三至三角外，最後在二角六左右，永紗自三九〇元至七二〇元，最後六五〇元，一五一號八三號二二四號一一七號一〇四號九四號一五七號一七一號，八五號一五二號九五號二一二號二三二號均來貼出，一七七號二二〇號五六號一五九號等貼　，新光自九元半至十三元，最後十一元，信和自一六五元至二七〇元，華豐目六元半至八究半。</p>

<h3>吳開先表示　決防止米價再漲　各區平糶米每月六萬五千石</h3>
<p>本市物價，數日來突又上漲，當局對此已極注意。社會局長吳開先，昨日曾就最近民食問題，及一般物價趨勢發表談話。據謂：最近米價上漲，極不合理，本人已密切注意。至食米上漲之主因，不外端節以前暴風大雨，致食米來源减少，造成奸商操縱機會，惟本市民食存量極爲充沛，且各地來源爲　極夥，決無缺乏之虞。爲防止米價再度上漲起見，決予加强民食調節工作。又謂民食調節會工作頗爲積極，昨日下午會議，已決定全市各區平縣米，每月供給六萬五千石云云。</p>

<h3>本年生絲出路問題　協導會決組設計會會研究</h3>
<p>本年度生絲出路問題，蠶絲協導會決另組設計委員會硏究。該委員會正待有關各方推出代表，聘定專家，即開第一次會議。據悉：本年度物價節節上漲，成本逐漸增高。目前成本，估計已近三千萬元。美國市價，亦不過四元四角左右，每担折合國幣祗七百餘萬，相差二千三百餘萬。商人固無力輸出，即由政府收購，所受虧累過大，國庫亦不勝其負担。故有關方面人士，僉主輸出，以之換取國外物資。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥注意夏令衛生  余正行　　春已悄悄地溜走了，轎陽又照射到人間。灼熱的日光，預示酷熱的來臨。氣候的突然轉變，增强細菌作樂的時機，可怕的疾病又將來襲。　　大上海或將展開一年一度的夏令衛生運動。檢騐冷食的製造，取締酸梅湯，凉粉凉麵等的販售，並勸告市民打防疫針。今天，夏季於流行的消化系疾病，尙未發現，果能有防患未然的打算，實爲市民慶幸！　　千百萬人在過去一年年的死去，不是因爲戰爭，也不是爲了洪水與飢饉，而是爲了愚昧與疏忽。沒有衛生常識，不講求衛生，致使疾病猖獗，超額死亡。一頁悲慘的史蹟已經讀過，但成許，還要去念最悲慘的一課。那便是死亡枕籍，屍骨如山的時候。請看，城市四週堆滿了垃圾，蓄積許多糞便，河渠塘池也完全發臭。大街小巷，隨處大小便，視若家常事。可不知這些都是危險物，都是病原的繁殖塲，集散地。氣候又帶來了蒼蠅與蚊子，誰說病與死的威脅不是日益近逼。　　廢棄物不能即時收集，那是最不幸的一件事。我們環遊市街，見到垃圾如山，臭氣冲天。一般人家從家裏將垃圾倒在戶外，汚水傾入溝渠中，似乎便盡了淸潔的責任。沒有垃圾箱的設置，原來已經堆好的垃圾，又爲檢拾破舊物的小孩，扒了出來，將他們所不要的散佈在人行道上。負責市街淸潔的淸道夫，沒有處理垃圾的規定時間，隨時揚起灰塵來。這充分說明衛生局未予以衛生訓練，更未注意到這也是危害市民健康的舉措。其所收集的垃圾，又在市區內廣塲中堆積，未予妥善處置，實屬危險之至。　　一般比較窮困的市民，居處環境，本來惡劣，兼靠近河渠，池塘，隨便將垃圾汚水傾入。有時又去洗衣，洗菜，甚至淘米。他們刷馬桶的時候，並未想到會使水染汚，影響公共健康。當使用這種水時，又夫想到這會呌自已被病菌侵害，結果往往是不幸的。在上海的人，並不見得全有事用自來水的機會。滬西自來水緊急工程計　，正說明安全飲水，在上海仍爲嚴重問題。可惜，飲用自來水的人，並未見到飲水問題的嚴車，飲用不潔水的人，也未想到去改善，危機便日漸深沉。　　小食攤販隨處都有，妨礙交通事小，危害健康事大。尤其夏令，這更危險了。雖然煮熟的熱食，危險較少，但在食前暴露了許久，又被咳嗽，噴嚏玷汚，也是靠不住的。至於，擺在馬路旁的五香牛肉，南京板鴨，鎭江肴肉，蕪湖豆干之類的食品，那更危險了。水菓和生蔬菜，老是用不淸潔的凉水，一遍一遍的冲洒，使它們潮濕，保持新鮮的樣子，那都是危險的。酸梅湯，創冰，凉粉之類，自然不用說了。　　「當心病從口入」，這可作爲夏令生活的警語。在夏令常見的幾種傳染病，如傷寒，霍亂，痢疾，都是經口傳染的。所以夏令榭生的主題，就是要「飲」與「吃」的小心。但這件小事，可以說在中國現社會沒有一個地方作到，可嘆！　　衛生是保障人類健康，使人類體格精神得到充分發展的一種手段。所以無論是個人生活，家庭生活或團體生活，都必須以合於衛生條件爲原則。由此推論，可知衛生實在是任何人，在任何時間與任何地點，所必須注意的一件事，並不限於某一特定的時間或地點。不過，因爲季節的不同，氣候的殊異，所形成的不同環境。在某一特殊季節，常有某種疾病容易發現或流行。以溫帶國家而論，在夏季最常見的流行病是消化系傳染病，在冬季則呼吸系傅染病比較易於流行。因而我們在不同的季節，就有許多應當特別注意的衛生問題。　　夏季旣是消化系傳染病易於流行的季節，所以夏令衛生運動，也可以說即是消化系傳染病預防運動。在夏令衛生方面，自然以如何進免消化系傳染病的傳染爲中心。消化系傳染病主要的有三種，即傷寒，痢疾，霍亂，對於這三種病的預防，並不太難。在歐美公共衛生發達的國家，醫學生想得一例爲實習，亦復不可能了。可知這實在是有辦法防制，但看作與不作。　　夏令衛生的開展，有兩方面：一是公共衛生，一是個人衛生。在公共衛生方面作得澈底，可以獲得預防的優良效果。譬如說飲水的供給，安全而潔凈，市民全可能享用。糞便汚物處理得當，沒有蒼蠅雜生。不良食品管制得法，杜絕病原入口。這樣當然不易有腸胃病人發現。即便發現，有合理的處置，隔離，消毒，治療均得法，自然不會蔓延廣泛。但是，公共衛生尙在蟄眠狀態，要到達理想標準，也不是一時可以作到的。　　現在，希望能切實注意個人衛生。首要的條件，便是自動地不妨害公共衛生。例如不再亂傾倒垃圾汚水，或隨地大小便。其次希望注意幾點；　　（一）及早注射霍亂預防針，或傷寒霍亂混合預防針，（二）不喝未煮沸的水，（三）不吃攤販售賣的食品，（三）不吃零售的瓜菓，（五）不吃生菜，（六）不吃衛生設備不良店鋪製造的食品，（七）不吃發酵或腐敗的食物，（八）不在池塘事或河裏洗菜，洗碗碟或淘米，（九）吃新鮮水菓，並除去外皮，（十）做成的食品要避兔蒼蠅的汚染，凡蒼蠅可過的食物不吃。　　自然，在公共衛生方面的努力，也是不能懈滯的。希望衛生當局，克盡所能，早日設法使市內公共衛生設施，趨於合理。再加上個人衛生的努力改善，將來一定有好的結果。旣往因疾病而死亡的人，便是今日獲取敎訓的代價，我們不能忘記這沉痛而可悲的敎訓！　　目前，是全上海政府與市民聯合以有效的行動制止夏令傳染病流行的時候，開會，決議，呼口號，發標語的時代已經過去了。必須以行動來爭取未來的成功，以實際來代替空言，切實注意　　亂的上海，髒的上海，緊接着來的，很容易造成瘟疫的上海，疾病入鬧市，死傷人必多。這五百萬多人口的大上海，萬萬不能任疾疫猖獗。撲滅傳染病　為醫者的當前急務  范守淵　　自從醫學走上科學的軌道，或者可以說，成爲科學的一個部門以後，他的功用，也無形中擴大開來：由個人的治療效用，漸漸地趨向於集團的或社會的預防的方面了。　　我國向來也有「上醫醫未病」的說話，　　這句「上醫醫未病」的意義，與今日科學醫的「預防」很相似：惟現在科學醫上的「預防」二字，比較偏向於傳染性的疾病方面。原因呢，因爲對於這種傳染病，大家都已明瞭了牠的來踪去跡，也都知道牠的兇險厲害；但牠必劉在不衛生的環境之下，始能逞强作威，始能彼此傳染而成疫，故能以人力去預防，去制止。換言之：如其使生活環境合乎衛生規則，預防工作十分周到嚴密，那末，就很可以預防傳染病的發生，制止傳染病的活動的。所以，我們可以知道，「預防」在近代醫學上的重要，尤其是對於傳染病的重要了。　　以往的醫者，其惟一的任務，在於治病；現今的醫者，却順應了朝流的推進，時代的需要，除了治療疾病而外，更加上一個重大的責任，此責任，即爲防病，亦即所謂預防的工作是。而預防工作的主要對象是什麼呢？這不消說，即爲此能够相互傳染成疫的傳染病。故預防傳染病，實爲預防的中心工作；同時，亦可以說是當今醫者的中心任務了。　　普通疾病，受痛苦者，只患者本身的個人或少數人，而不能因自己的病痛疾苦，影響及於他人；傳染病則不然：牠可以將自已所患的病症傳染於他人，由自己的病痛牽連到其他的人們，其受害的人數，可由一人而傳染蔓延於千萬人；故其發病之速，受害之烈，實非普通疾病所可比。　　據說：中國人的平均壽命，只有三十歲；原因當然很多，但傳染的增長，我想定是其中的大原因。　　本來可以不病，因爲「預防」不善，衛生不講究，竟然病了；本來得病以後，可以不死，爲了處理不得其法，終至不救，終於死了。這是中國境內隨處可見的事實，也就是使國人平均壽命低落、死亡率增高的惟一原因。　　好比，傳染病中的傷寒症，在歐美各國，已屬罕見，如病院中發見了一位二位傳染病人，就希奇的不得了。中國人在歐美學習醫科的，要臨床見習傷寒症，是一件不容易的事；說不定學習三五年的醫學，見習不到一個眞正的傷寒病人哩。而在中國，却到處可以看見；醫院中的病人統計，尤其是內科領域中的病人人數，傷寒病人，要估着很大的數目。其他的傳染病，加痢疾，霍亂，白喉，腥紅熱，腦膜炎等等，當然亦屬事同一例。至於得病以後的死亡率的增加，亦屬意中之事。因爲一則，中國科學的幼稚，不普及，二則，舊醫的不明傳染病，治療不能合理。　　如何來制止傳染病的發生，撲滅傳染的蔓延，其責任，無疑地，就該落在我們每個醫者的肩頭上。傷寒症淺說  朱金聲　　俗語說：「病從口入」。傷寒症，正是傳染病中「病從口入」的一個好例子。　　傷寒症，有一種急性週身性的傳染症。致病的原因爲一種桿狀的細菌，有鞭毛，甚活潑，稱之有傷寒菌。　　傳染的來源，多從沾有傷寒菌的水，牛奶，食物，或病者的接觸而來。傷寒菌入口後，先至胃部。無數的細菌，爲胃酸所消滅。但亦有未彼胃酸消滅的細菌，逃過胃關，而入十二指腸，小腸，而達離小腸末端不遠之淋巴腺，生長繁殖起來。一部份傷寒菌，從琳巴腺經過淋巴管，走入血中帶到週身。此時取血作細菌培養，最爲可靠。細菌入血後，病者體溫逐漸增加，胸部署出玫瑰色疹，咳勢，有時鼻孔出血，腹部不舒，腹瀉或秘結等現象。兩星期後，血中細菌培養通常便沒有細菌；但魏道氏反應（Widal’s　Test）變成正性，這是因爲兩星期後，病者血中已產生兔疫體的緣故。所以要診斷傷寒症在第一第二星期內，以血的細菌培養，最爲可靠而在第二星期之後以魏道氏反應，較爲準確。此時血中雖然已經產生了免疫體，並不是說，病人已經好了；相反地，病者的病况，仍然繼續着發展，並沒有减輾的現象。　　這是因爲在小腸的末端二尺至四尺處的腸黏膜，起了潰爛變化。這時候，病者的危險性最大，因為腸黏膜的潰爛，可以有兩併發症可以發生。第一種，即所謂腸出血；這是因為腸潰爛部有血管破裂，流血不止，而有瀉血的現象。通常發生在傷寒症的第三期中。它的危險性，須要看流血的多少。通常治療的方法，就是利用輸血，以捕病者血的損失。但有時因出血過多，輸血亦歸無效。少量腸出血，往往可以自動停止。第二種也是最危險性的併發症，就是腸穿或腸破裂；這是因爲腸黏膜潰爛的結果。使腸壁破裂，腸內的含物從破裂處流到腹腔內，而成腹膜炎。這時除乘早發覺，實施外科手術，將腸破裂處縫好外，大多數都是無救的。但通常不是發覺已晚，無法施手術，就是病人的抵抗力太薄弱，經不起外科手術。所以這種併發症的死亡率最大。此症亦在傷寒症第三期中發生。　　以上所說的兩種併發症，並不是隨病者最初兩星期的嚴重性而定。換句話說：病者在最初二星期中，亦許寒熱並不太高，徽象亦不太嚴重，而在第三星期中，驟然嚴重，而有腸穿的變化發生。所以生傷寒病的人，自己萬不可以爲在最初二星期中，病勢不甚嚴重，而忽略到第三星期的突然變化；相反地，生傷寒病的人，也不要絕望，以爲自己在最初二星期中，病勢很况重，而預測在第三星期中必定有腸穿或腸出血的併發症的到來。生傷寒病的人，須平心靜氣地地等待第三星期的過去，到了第四星期，如果無上述兩種併發症發生，大槪是難關已過，病勢會逐漸减輕，寒熟亦逐日下降，而達到正常的體溫。於治療方面：一般人的觀念，以爲生了傷寒病，食物是絕對不宜入口的。理由會是：飲食往往使病勢加重，（普通一般人的見解以爲如此）。但是我們仔細一想，病者每日寒熱很高，身體內的新陳代謝，加速分解，作用加倍；假定平常人每日熟能的消耗量，是二千卡（Calone）那麽，傷寒病者的消耗量，非四千卡不可。如果不進食物，怎樣能夠平衡大量熱能的消耗呢？所以我覺得，有營養性的液體食物，必須儘量的供給病者，有營養性的液體食物，如牛奶，鷄汁，牛肉汁，鮮橘汁等，可以儘量的供給病者。因為這些液體，都是無渣食物，入腸後，大都很快的就吸收了，決不至於影響小腸末端傷寒潰爛處的；相反地病者的病况，可因營義充足，往往可以復原快些。就是併發症如腸出血及腸穿的發生，可能性似乎也可减少。當然我需要聲明的就是：當病者已有併發症如腸穿及腸出血之現象時，那就絕對不能進食物了。我們知道傷寒症，是沒有特效藥的；目前所發明的新藥，如配尼西靈及斯屈特麥新（Streptomysin），都沒有確實的功效。所以護理及飲食方面的治療最是重要。最後，如果病人已好，我們需要注意的，就是病人的大便中，時常有傷寒菌存在。逼種病人，常是傷寒症的「帶菌體」。我們務必將帶菌體隔離，除非大便檢査，證明沒有傷寒菌的存在，這也是需要注意的。糊塗與可憐  兆箕　　中國人對於數字，向來是不大注意的，連全國人口的數字，從民元至今，都還沒有精確的統計，說來也眞可憐。可是糊塗的事，也正多着，速負有大衆保健任務的「醫師」人數，也可以隨便亂說，豈不可笑。並且在出席中華醫學會第七屆大會時所說，更顯得「糊塗與可憐」了！中國人口四萬萬，（不準確的零數，且不去說他）。我想衛生當局，大約總應該曉得的；那麼全國醫師人數，（中醫除外）都經過衛生署的登記，自然也有數字可以統計的，（據聞是一萬三千餘人）何以說照全國人口比例，每一萬人中，已有醫師（指正式登記的西醫）一人，這就差得太遠。不知是否我國人口，竟因連年的內亂外息而突然减少呢？還是西醫人數，同「太上老君一氣化三淸」一樣，突然增加了數倍呢？他又說：歐美各國每七千人中有醫師一人，後來接着更正說：是七十人中有醫師一人；（以上都是筆者所親耳聽到的，但是「上海醫事新聞」所載的某某致詞，已將這數字擅自修正了）。據我所知，這個數字，也是不對的。然而以一個擁有四萬萬以上人口的大國，只有一萬三千多個正式醫師，眞是貧乏得十分「可憐」！過了幾天，我又看到本年四月三十日出版的「紅十字月刋」，第十六期後面「醫學珍聞」欄，却有着這樣一段新聞：　　「聯總醫學專家艾羅梭，在中國攷察一年半後，返抵美國舊金山談：中國死亡人數，約四分之三，可用極少代價而獲得拯救；補救之法，不外提倡衛生，提高營養，與增加醫師三端。艾氏認爲中國醫療情形，極爲可怖；蓋平均每八萬人中，僅有醫師一人，而美國方面，則一千五百人，即有醫師一人；兩國相差，誠爲太遠」。這樣的說法，如與這次在中華醫學會大會中的話，對比起來，就差得更遠；究竟誰是誰非？眞如「丈二和尙」，令人更有摸不着頭腦之感了！可是據我想來，艾氏所說的美國人口與醫師人數的比例，大約是比較正確的。不過他在中國攷察了一年半，仍把中國八萬人中僅有醫師一人的話說出來，也可見其疏忽與糊塗的程度，其實這個比例，乃是十多年前的數字，（戰前全國正式西醫人數，只有七千左右，是不錯的）。恐怕艾氏來中國攷察期間，莫非又是什麽人糊塗透頂，誤將戰前的醫師登記統計數字，提供給他，害了艾氏也閙此笑話，是否如此？我就無法可以預料了！事實上，目前的醫師人數，與人口總數平均起來，該是四萬人不到，可有正式醫師（西醫）一人；這雖是約數，可是並不十分相差的。試想我國醫師人數，如此之少，不但「可憐」，誠如艾氏所說：「極爲可怖」！關於「增加醫師」的方法，途徑雖多，但是設法甄別無照醫師，放寬尺度，予以合法登記的機會，何嘗不是方法之一種。我希望我們考試和衛生的最高常局，應該早爲之計，力謀補救；以大衆疾苦，民族生命爲重，不要再長此「糊塗」下去了！　　照全國人口比例　每四萬人中醫師佔一人五官器的生理衛生（上）  白丁　　五官，就是人體外表的五樣器官：耳，目，鼻，舌和皮膚。這五件器官，都是負有感受外界各種刺激的作用的，故又統稱牠們爲感覺器。　　現在，就按上列所排的這五個感覺器的程序，一個個的往下說去：先將每個感覺器的生理概念說上幾句，再說牠們各個的攝護衛生。　　先說耳：耳，就是人體司聽的器官；外界所有的聲音，都由牠管理。牠怎麽管理的呢？說來話長。簡略的說：外界的發音體振動時，先使空氣振動，生起一種音波，這空氣中的音波的一部，就傳達於耳內，感動聽神經的末稍，而使之興奮，末稍神經再將這種音波的興奮，報吿於腦子就生出聲音的感覺來。這就是「聽覺」的一點簡單原理。次說目：目，就是人體司視物的眼睛。牠是怎樣視物的呢？由於外界的光綫從物質的反射，映入眼中，這時，眼中分布着的視神末稍，就受了刺激，馬上報吿大腦，於是才生出一種視物的感覺。這一種視物的感覺，就稱牠爲「視覺」。再說鼻和舌：鼻是司嗅的器，舌呢？是嚐味的工具，這，是任何人都會知道的。那末，鼻是如何嗅味東西的呢？舌又是怎樣　味道的呢？就得來一說了。凡物質報各有牠固有的臭氣，什麽呌臭氣呢？就是物質的微細分子，混在空氣當中，觸到鼻腔中黏膜所分布的嗅神經，而起一種　氣的刺激，嗅神經就毫不簡慢的通知到腦子，於是就生出一種所謂「嶼覺」的感覺來。司味覺的舌呢，也是一樣的道理：物質到了口裏，待溶解而碰到舌面等處的味神經時，遂生出「味覺」的這個感覺。末言作爲「觸覺」的皮膚：譬如我現在拿一支筆桿，在紙上搖動寫字，我是淸淸楚楚的覺得着，我的幾個指頭夾着一支寫字的筆桿的；如其我把筆放下，置於被子上，我的手指頭，便馬上失去這個筆桿與指頭接觸的感覺。同時，在觸物感覺的時光，選會感知到這件東西的壓迫，溫冷，及其部位的，這種皮膚報吿外界刺激的感覺，就呌「觸覺」。　　以上把稱爲感覺器的五官的生理槪念，或者說是界說吧，已很簡潔的說明了；往下，就來述牠們的衛生。　　（一）耳的衛生：耳就是司聽的聽覺器，已如上述，那末，所謂耳的衛生，也就是聽覺器的衛生了。我們要講究這聽覺器的耳的衛生，第一，不消說得，首光要設法保護耳的安全健全，勿使受外物的傷害。如何的保護方法，才能使之安全，勿使傷害呢？如一，理　時，勿令剃除耳毛，因耳毛，實爲保護耳的安全保護器，有許多外界進去的東西，尤其是小動物之類，就可爲耳毛所阻，不得深入。否則，如有異物入內，當然，尤其是能活動的小動物，爲昆虫之類，侵入之後，便無阻擋之物，便如入無門之境，深入耳內，釀成種種耳症。二，耳垢爲耳的分泌物，過分去取牠弄牠，以致弄破耳膜，固為害非淺；然如積之過多，亦能妨碍聽覺，口易造成耳鳴等現象，故亦應設法取出之。惟取時，切勿應用堅硬之金屬器具，以兔傷害爲要。三，夏季游泳時，應用棉花等物密塞耳中，因水流入耳內，亦常引起耳炎等症，有碍耳的安全。四，我們舊式劇塲，樂聲特別强烈，亦甚有妨耳內的　神經，即有碍於耳的司聽的生理功用。五，凡在發作雷聲，開放大礮等發聲過高之時，宜張大其口，使耳中的鼓膜，內外氣壓平衡，以免有震破的危險。這以上各條，是保護耳的衛生方法。</p>

<p>春秋一個舊式戀愛的故事  美·沙洛揚著　林鳳藻譯　　我的表弟阿拉克比我小一歲半，圓面孔，黑皮色，態度特別好。他一點也不是勉强。他的態度生來就自然，我的態度生來就壞。在學校裏碰到麻煩，阿拉克總是能够躱過，他恭順的一笑，露出疏落的門牙，把老師苔菲尼的鐵石心腸輭化了。至於我呢，總是鑽進麻煩的核心，又吵又閙，總說我沒有錯，錯的是苔菲尼小姐或別人。而且如果必要，我願把這案子閙到最高法院，證明我無罪。　　我常被喊到辦公室。有些時候，我在辦公室跟校長戴仁傑先生辯論，載先生並不善辯，到最後我總是挨一頓打。當我把他辯論得無話可說的時候，他就拿出皮鞭子來。　　阿拉克跟我不同；他並不擁護公道。他遠不及我聰明；可是雖比我小一歲半，他跟我同班。這當然沒有什麽，如果我們的班不是第五年級。我同老師們辯論，總是我勝，可是他們不放我走，不讓我升班，我想唯一的原因，就是希望在下一個學期把我駁倒，才能甘心。因此我在第五年級是年紀最大的學生。　　有一天，黑板上寫着一首詩，說苔菲尼小姐與戴仁傑先生戀愛，又說苔小姐長得醜。苔小姐想吿訴大家，這詩是我做的。其實這詩的作者不是我，而是我的表弟阿拉克。我做詩，總不會做苔菲尼小姐，而是比較有價値的東西。苔小姐手執戒尺，走到我桌子旁邊，也沒有提什麽人的名字，就說：『我要找出在黑板上寫那可惡東西的人，並且處罰他。』　　『「他」！』我說。『你怎麼知道作者是男孩子，而不是女孩子！』　　苔小姐在我右手關節上敲了一記。我從座位上跳起來說道，『你不能白打我的指關節，我要報吿。』　　『坐下來，』苔小姐說。　　我坐了下來。她拉我的右耳朶。這耳朶給邰小姐與其他老師們拉來拉去，走了樣子了。　　我坐着，輕輕的說，輕得幾乎不易聽到：『你等着瞧罷。』　　『擱起舌頭不許再講，』苔小姐說。我雖痛得像個鬼，但眞的伸出了舌頭擱着。班上墨西哥，日本，亞美尼亞，希臘，意大利，萄葡牙，與普通美國的男小孩女小孩，大家看我演滑稽戲，哄然大笑。苔菲尼小姐拿起戒尺，要敲我手，但戒尺擦着我的鼻子。這對我是特種的侮辱，因爲那時也同現在一樣，我的鼻子大。要是鼻子少一些，就擦不到了。苔小姐這一擊，我認爲是對我大鼻子的一個微妙的敎訓。　　我把我打靑了的手掩着鼻子，又站了起來。　　『原是你呌我擱起舌頭，』我脫。我又說我只是依她的命令，沒有做錯事，沒有犯規，她不該敵我手，不該擦我鼻子。　　『你要守規矩，』苔小姐說，『我不能再忍受你的胡閙了。你要守規矩。』　　我把手從鼻子上放下，開始守規矩了。我笑了一笑，好像我是一個孩子，正在送她一個紅色的蘋果。我的觀衆大笑了一陣。苔小姐丟了戒尺，伸着身子抓我，從桌子上滾了下來，立刻爬起，滿屋子跑着追我。　　『我又鬧了，』我對自己說。苔小姐還在滿屋子跑着追我。『我又鬧出麻煩來了，末後會鬧成命案。表弟阿拉克是犯人，而他坐着一笑着。任何地方都是沒有公道的。』　　後來苔小姐捉住了我。我知道，她總會捉住我的，除非我願意　受校長戴仁傑先生更嚴重的處罰。她捉住了我，就隨便起來，好　要挖出我的眼睛，拉去我的耳朶，手指，臂膀。我呢，還在辯論，希望她脾氣好，希望她　　體面女子。　　　攪得累了。當我走回座位的時候，原來的罪案又提出來了：誰在黑板上寫那首情詩？　　苔小姐理了理頭髮與衣服，透一口氣，又發問了。過了幾分鐘，大家沒有響，聽到的只是時鐘的嗒嗒之聲，她於是說道：　　『我一個一個點名，問你們到底那一個——在黑板上寫這可惡的——詩，你們要從實說。你們說謊，我會知道，但處罰就更嚴重了。』　　她就一個一個問那些男孩子女孩子，有沒有寫那首詩。當然他們都說沒有寫。她問我的表弟阿拉克，他也說沒有寫。然後她問我，我說沒有寫，這是事實。　　『你到辦公室去，』她說。『你這說謊的人。』　　『我沒有在黑板上寫過什麽詩，』我說。『而且我不是說謊的人。』　　戴仁傑先生見了我，不很高與，過了兩分鐘，同班的固本蘇茜小姐跑來送信，敍述我的罪狀。實際上，只是引用這罪狀。戴校長看了信，臉上變了六七個樣子，笑了一笑，扣上吊帶，咳了一聲嗽，說道：『誰要你寫那首小詩的？』　　『我沒有寫，』我說。　　『當然，』他說，『你說要沒有寫，但你爲什麼要寫？』　　『我沒有注意到她見你的時候表示什麼，』我說：『「你」是不是跟「她」有了愛情，或有了什麼？』　　『我「沒有」寫，』我說。　　『不要這樣固執，』戴先生說，『這謠言傳出去，相當可怕。你怎麼「知道」苔菲尼小姐是和我戀愛？』　　『「她是麽」？』我說。　　『不過，』戴先生說，『信上這麼稅。你從那裏得了這印像？你有沒有注意，她見我的時候表示欽佩或什麽？』　　『現在還不知道，』戴先生說。『這首詩一直到某一段，寫得並不壞。你眞的以爲苔小姐生得醜麽？』　　『我沒有寫那首詩，』我說。『我可以證明。我不是這樣寫的。』　　『你的意思是說，你的筆跡跟黑板上的筆跡不同，』戴先生說。　　『是，』我說。『我也不做那樣的詩。』　　『那末你「承認」做詩了？』戴先生說。　　『我做詩，』我說，『但不做「那樣的』詩。』　　「居然有這樣的謠言，』戴先生說。『我希望你自己知道你做的是什麽一回事。』　　『喔，』我說，『我知道的就是我沒有寫那首詩。』　　『就我個人意見而論，』戴先生說；「我覺得苔菲尼小姐不但不醜，而且好看。』　　『喔，那很好』我說。『我所要求的就是不要碰到與我無關的種種麻煩。』　　『你「能」寫那首詩，』戴先生說。　　『不是「那首」詩，』我說。『我可以寫一首好詩，』　　『什麼呌做「好」？』戴先生說。『你是說美麗？還是說侮辱？』　　『我是說美麗，』我說，『可是這與苔菲小姐無關。』　　『一直到此刻，』戴先生說，『我倒願意懷疑你是那首詩的作者，但現在不同了。我相信，那首詩是你寫的。因此必須處罰你。』　　我站起來，開始辯論。　　『我沒有做什麽，你要打我，』我說，『我是不會罷休的？』　　於是他給我一頓打。『全學校』都聽到了。我一　一跛的走回敎室。黑板上的詩拭去了。事情過去了。犯人已經處罰，詩已經擦去，第五年級的秩序也恢復了。我的表弟阿拉克坐在那裏一聲不響，正在欣賞愛麗絲波娃小姐的樓色鬆髮。　　一下課，我就把表弟一拳打倒，騎在他身上。　　『我已經挨了一次打了，』我說，『以後不許再寫那些東西。』但第二天早上，黑板上又來了一首情詩，毫無疑問是表弟阿拉克的手筆，毫無疑問是他的作風。苔菲尼小妣要找出犯人，處罰他。我走進敎室，看到這首詩，又看到敎室裏的情形，立刻表示異議。我的表弟阿拉克實在做得太過分了。於是我用亞美尼亞語對他發誓。他不作聲，像一塊石頭。苔小妣以爲我在跟她說話。『喂，喂，』她說，『你如果有話講，請你講大家懂的語言。』　　『我要說的就是我沒有寫這首詩，』我說，『並且我沒有寫昨天那首詩。如果爲了這些詩確到麻煩，我是不會罷休的。』　　『坐下來，』苔小姐說。　　苔菲尼小姐點了名以後，在一張紙上寫滿了字，附着這首新詩，要我送到辦公室。　　『爲什麽要「我」送，』我說，『我沒有寫這詩。』　　『我要你送，你就送，』苔小姐說。　　我走到她的桌旁邊，伸手拿信，苔小姐把我拍一記。我就向後跳了三尺，大呌道，『我不能替你傳遞情書。』　　這是到了限度了。每樣東西都有一個限度。苔小姐就跳着跑來捉我。我心裏恨我表弟阿拉克，就轉過身往他身上一撲。他假裝無罪，一點也不抵抗。他很乖巧，沒有受到嚴重的損失。我在地板上打滾，於是給苔小姐捉住了。我只能由她。我就拿了這封信到辦公室，面上手上全是擦傷打傷的痕跡，而苔菲尼小姐給戴仁傑先生的那封情書已經弄皺，有些地方已經撕壞了。　　『發生了什麽事情？』戴先生說，『好，讓我看這信，你又閙了什麽玩意？』　　他接了信，把它拆開，攤在桌上，把它拉平，然後慢慢的讀。他看了三四遍。他很得意；依我看來，他實在在戀愛了。他回過頭來，臉上堆滿了笑。但因爲我說邵菲尼小姐醜，他又要責罰我。　　『我沒有寫這首詩，』我說，『我也沒有寫昨天那首詩。我只要求有一個機會能够受一些敎育，能够過活，能够一個人過活。』　　『好罷，好罷，』戴先生說　　他非常高興。　　『如果你跟她戀愛，』我說，『那是你的事，不要把我攪在裏頭。』　　『我要可囑你的就是，你對苔小姐的容貌要客氣一些，』戴先生說，『如果你覺得她平凡，也許旁的人並不覺得平凡。』　　我討厭透了。這些簡直是廢話。　　『好罷，明天起我就客氣了。』　　『這就好了，』戴先生說，但『今天還得處罰你。』　　他一隻手伸到桌子下面的抽屜裏去拿皮鞭子。　　『啊，不要，』我說，『如果你把我處罰，我就不客氣了。』　　『啊，但是你今天寫的詩怎麼辦！』戴先生說，『我必須處罰你。明天是另外一回事。』　　『不，』我說，『這不對。」「好，好罷，』戴先生說，『可是你一定得客氣。』　　『我一定客氣，』我說，『我可以走了罷。』　　『可以，』他說，『可以。讓我想一想。』　　我開始離開辦公室了。　　『等一下，』他說，『除非他們聽到你喊呌，他們會疑心的。你還是跑來，大喊十次，然後回去。』　　『大喊？』我說，『除非打痛，我不能大喊。』　　『啊，你當然可以喊，』戴先生說，『你就大聲悲痛的喊，你可以喊。』　　『我不相信我可以喊，』我說。『那麼我用這皮鞭打這椅子十下，』戴先生說，「同時，你就喊。』　　『你以爲這個辦得通嗎？』我說。　　『當然辦得通，』他說，『開始。』　　截仁傑先生就用皮鞭打椅子，我就像昨天那樣的呌喊。可是喊得並不像眞的總有些可疑。　　正在這樣進行的時候，苔菲尼小姐走到辦公室來了，可是因爲聲音的關係，我們沒有注意她　　戴仁傑先生打了十下的時候，我回過頭對他說，『十下了。』　　正在回頭的時候，我看到苔菲尼小姐，她張開了嘴，表示驚異。　　『孩子，再來幾下，』戴先生說，『好好的再來幾下。』　　我還沒有吿訴他苔小姐已經到辦公室了。他還在　椅子，我還在呌。　　眞是可惡。　　苔菲尼小姐咳了一聲，戴仁傑先生回過頭去，看見她—他的愛人。　　苔菲尼小姐沒有講話，她『不能』講。戴仁傑先生笑了。他覺得非常尷尬，把皮鞭子搖來搖　　『我正在責罰這孩子，』他說。　　『我懂，』苔小姐說。　　她沒有懂，至少沒有全懂。　　『我不能讓這學校裏任何孩子這樣沒有禮貌。』戴先生說。　　他正同她愛得火熱，只是把皮鞭搖來搖去，想略爲裝出一些尊嚴。他名爲責罰孩子，實在是槌椅子，同時孩子呌着。一個大人與一個孩子正在表現正義與眞愛。苔小姐看到這些，並不覺得有何可取。她給他了一副不好看的臉色。　　『啊！』戴先生說，『你的意思是嫌我打這椅子？我們正在預演，是不是，孩子？』　　『「不，不是」，』我說。　苔菲尼小姐氣極了，回過頭去，匆匆走了。戴仁傑先生坐了下來。　　『你看，你做的事，』他說　　『啊，』我說，『你要同她浪漫，就同她浪漫，但不要把我攪在裏頭。』　　『好，』戴先生說，『算了罷，算了罷。』　　他是一個很可憐的人。　　『好，』他說，「回到敎室裘去。』　　『我要你知道，我沒有寫那些詩。』　　『沒有關係，』戴先生說。　　『我以爲你要知道，』我說　　『現在太遲了，』他說，『她不再佩服我了。』　　『你幹麼不給她做一首詩呢？』我說。　　『「我不會做詩」，』　先　　『好罷，」我說，『想想看罷。』　　當我回到敎室的時候，苔菲尼小姐非常客氣。我也非常客氣。她知道我知道，而且她也知道，如果她對我發作，我會破壞她的浪漫史，或逼她嫁給戴先生，所以她對我表示好感。　　過了兩個禮拜，學校放假了，到了開學的時候，苔菲尼小姐不見了。也許戴仁傑先生沒有做一首詩送她，也許他做了一首詩，而做得不好；也許他沒有吿訴她他愛她，也許他吿訴她他愛她，而她不理；也許他向她求婚，而她沒有接受，「因爲給我知道了」，於是她轉到別的學校，去療養她破碎的心去了。　　結果大槪如此。音樂語錄  忠祈　　要創造一個家，好的火和好的音樂是必需的。（RL．Stevenson）　　音樂洗去靈魂間的塵埃。（Eog．Prov．經過音樂的途程，一個孩子進入了美的境界。（National　Chid　Welr．are　Association）洛泊河  邱吉爾英國戰時首相邱吉爾上月初在倫敦皇家學會展覽的兩輻油畫，曾經獲得不少好評。本圖即邱翁以「溫特」爲筆名送呈該學會審查入選的本年度的代表作，「阿爾伯斯山邊的洛泊河」。（英新開處）　碧湘閣詞  陳家

他們及她們穿着蒙古人的服裝，女人有時披着一條五顏六色的毛氈上市，新生的小孩，用抱裙紥得像一個舖蓋捲。我曾經讀過他們的象形文字，多數和說文當同。他們每年舉行蛇舞，美國人從遠道來土人區預訂旅館，參觀盛會。我發覺他們的服飾和假面具竟和蒙古人的打鬼相同。據傳紅印度人從蒙古經西伯利亞到阿拉斯加轉入美洲，當時亞洲與美洲相聯，並無白林海峽，這種說法並無事實的證明，不過紅印度人的面貌，黄色圓臉黑髪。以及文字服飾日常生活建築和中國漠北人民相同。美國人鑒於成吉思汗的野心，對紅印度人來自蒙古諱莫如深，恐怕再有成吉思汗其人向美洲爲紅印度人收復失地。我在阿利桑那省時最喜歡參觀紅印度人的蒙古包，不過形狀略與蒙古包有別；蒙古包是圓頂的，紅印度包却是尖項的，在跳蛇舞時，他們打着鼓，好像是戰國時鳴鼓而攻，我們排成隊伍，他們像長蛇般跳過來，一一和我們握手，表示親善。我心中在想，這五千年前的同胞，居然會在道裘握手。有一個酋長，約定一個日子和我披了羽毛打扮成酋長合影以爲紀念，可惜我因事忙竟未踐約。（四）金聲的鍊心石  又今　　明末一位反抗韃子的民族英雄金聲先生，（正希）雖然他是不會帶兵不會打仗的一介書生，却也曾在徽州山地中練過許多民團鄉勇，做過好幾千人的主帥。在他訓練民團的地方，（今名土城岩），有一小山，怪石峻嶒，山嘴則有一石伸出甚遠，下臨淸流激湍，頗足悚人心目，據說此石爲金公常立之處，他特別替它取一個名字呌做鍊心石，大槪是居高臨危鍜鍊此心不使生懼的意思吧。　　我因見此石而懷想到節義凜然不憂不懼的金聲先生，因鍊心之名又聯想起孟子不動心之說。我們到底應該怎樣由鍊心而不動心呢？　　眞能鍊心之後，威武不屈，金先生由抗淸而死難，大約得此石之助不少，佛家說要鍊金剛不壞之身，當然也要鍊金剛不壞之心，儒佛有相通之理，決心都是由鍜鍊而成。　　金聲先生是旣通儒理復有佛心的。外面邪魔不易侵入，所以能始終保全大節，雖然被執了去，也不致於「落水」。像鍊心右下的流水雖然險急，也絕不能使他些微有動於心，何况「落水」！兪曲園（　）有鍊心石弔金正希一律云：　　「蒼龍　賽作龍吟，怪石横空俯萬尋。我　驚垂二分足，先生此鍊百年心。空山草木英風在，南渡君臣暮氣深。塡海補天無一濟，處淵黯黯日光沉。」　　我們誦到「我輩驚垂二分足，先生此鍊百年心」的句子，一面向不動心的金先生致敬，一面又想到鍊心到不動心的另一例。修行道地經有一故事，設某國有一大臣，受國王之命，持油滿缽，行二十里路，如果漏出一滴汕，便須斬首，那位大臣的心是非常鎭靜的，他把整個的心放在油缽上面，雖然在路上碰到美女，大象，甚至於焚燒宮殿的大火，他始終不動心，捧着油缽，一滴不　地達到了目的地，國王於是歎息道：　　「雖過衆難，其心不移，如是人者，無所不辦。」　　在今天，我們要有「雖遇衆難，其心不移」的定力，雖然不易學到這位持缽大臣行二十里路持油缽而不漏一滴的大本領，但總應該先以金正希的鍊心法爲第一步，臨危不懼，遇驗不移，登高自卑，行遠目　，倘徒作庸人自擾，相驚伯有，或暮氣太深，自嗟沒落，那便即幸而不落水，亦將被斬首，眞正的沒有救星了。</p>

<h3>The Siping Battle Nears Its End: National Army Could Converge on Two Routes; Communist Troops Outside Jilin Fleeing South</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th Dispatch] The National Army, advancing on Siping from the north and south between Shenyang and Changchun, is making favorable deployments and striving for the initiative. The southern route is clearing out and intercepting Communist troops north of Changtu. The northern route is facing off outside Gongzhuling. A major battle is expected between Gongzhuling and the Dongliao River banks south to Guojiadian. From the 25th to the 26th, fierce fighting in Siping has not ceased. Communist troops are taking turns attacking the eastern district. Furthermore, the Communist 7th Brigade reinforced Siping on the 25th to participate in the battle. Due to unfamiliar terrain, casualties were quite heavy. It is learned that the Communist troops are also unable to reinforce further, and the Siping battle may end soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] The Shenbei National Army's Advance Corps crossed Changtu and advanced northward. The Communist 2nd Column concentrated on the Quantou line, attempting to resist stubbornly. Quantou, directly below Siping, has no defensible terrain. The Siping battle is nearing its end. Yesterday was surprisingly quiet, with only sporadic Communist artillery fire heard. The Air Force continued to carry out powerful attacks on the surrounding Communist troops. On the morning of the 26th, the Communist troops on the Quantou-Erbushibao line showed clear signs of weakness and retreated in two directions, one towards Dongfeng and the other towards Bamiancheng. Director Du has telegraphed General Chen Mingren, stating that they will converge in Siping within two days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] According to intelligence obtained by the military, the majority of the Communist troops in Siping have withdrawn. Only a few regiments are confronting the Siping garrison. Yesterday, the Siping garrison recovered a stronghold west of the railway. However, according to military observers, the Communist troops seem to be concentrating on the north and south sides of Siping, attempting to prevent the powerful National Army corps from attacking on two fronts. Although the dangerous situation in Siping is easing, the Communist troops still have the ambition for a final desperate attack. The outcome of the battle within the week will be revealed. Our concerns are twofold: (1) that the Communist troops are deliberately creating a false impression to protect their main force's safe escape; (2) that the Communist troops, humiliated in defeat, may angrily turn back and attack Changchun. While this is concerning, it is not a major worry.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] A large number of Communist troops, fleeing back from Siping, have gathered on the Gongzhuling line, obviously wanting to prevent the southward National Army from crossing Dujiagou and pressing on Gongzhuling. The National Army encountered more than 2,000 Communist troops attempting to attack northward at Yujiawopeng. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Communist troops were routed. The majority of the Communist troops are blocking the National Army on the right side of the railway from the west and southwest.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] Pan Yukun, commander of the New First Army, along with Yang Wen, commander of the 50th Division, and many staff members, inspected the Changnan area along the highway on the morning of the 26th, giving many instructions to the generals of the Advance Corps. Pan and his party returned to Changchun that evening. Furthermore, the National Army advancing southward along the Chang-Shen road bypassed Gongzhuling on the 25th and continued to send powerful forces to advance rapidly southward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] The strong forces of the National Army advancing on Siping from Changchun and Shenyang are now only a hundred kilometers apart, destroying the Communist troops' obstruction efforts, and will soon press on Siping. Also, according to a telegram from Kaiyuan, Director Zheng Tu arrived in Kaiyuan from Tieling at noon on the 26th to command the northbound reinforcement troops. After the National Army cleared out the remaining Communist troops in the vicinity, it went straight for Siping in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, a small group of Communist troops raided Xinlitun on the Changchun-Yitong highway and were routed by the mopping-up troops. On the Ji-Chang line, the National Army is mopping up the area near Quanpichang after crossing Tumenling.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 26th Dispatch] The Communist troops in eastern Jilin's feigned attacks and feint offensives on the south bank of the Songhua River last week have completely failed. Wula Street and Jiangmifeng, former Communist outposts, are now almost military vacuum zones. The Communist troops in that area have fled south. The area around Jilin has been quiet for days. The Communist troops are only staging feigned attacks with small units in the Kouqian area in the southwest to prevent the Jilin National Army from crossing the river to pursue them. Furthermore, at noon on the 26th, the National Army's leading rapid advance troops had reached Chalucha. Part of the Communist troops' Independent Division entrenched there had retreated to the Yinma River, Guandi, and Shaoguojie areas (all north of Chalucha).</p>
<h3>National Army in Central Shandong Advances on Multiple Routes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th Dispatch] The National Army in central Shandong is advancing eastward and northward on multiple routes. The National Army advancing northward from Heyangzhen entered Miaojiaqu at 6:00 PM on the 26th and annihilated a regiment of the Communist 5th Column. Furthermore, the National Army advancing towards Tanbu from Mengyin recovered strongholds such as Dianzi and Nan Shimen, 14 kilometers east of the city, on the 26th and continued to advance eastward. Furthermore, the National Army's mopping-up troops cleared out the remaining Communist troops in the Wanjia Valley, Honggou, and Dongwangdu areas northeast of Mengyin on the 26th. There is currently no trace of Communist troops between Shanxian and Chengwu in western Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th Dispatch] The National Army at Longshan east of Jinan advanced on multiple routes towards Mingshui and Boshan on the 26th. More than a thousand Communist troops north of the Great Wall in southern Shandong were surrounded and are being annihilated by the National Army on the 25th.</p>
<h3>It Is Said That Fu Zuoyi Encouraged His Subordinates</h3>
<p>Not to Be Seen as Bureaucrats by the People</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gui Sui, 25th Dispatch] Director Fu originally intended to go to the Ih Ju League, He Tao, to comfort the Mongolian and Han soldiers and civilians. However, Director Li sent a special plane yesterday to pick him up for military discussions. Therefore, at 8:30 AM on the 25th, he hurriedly left Sui, accompanied by his wife and staff, and flew to Ping. Before leaving, he convened a meeting of military and political cadres and warned them that while the people hate the Communist Party today, they also do not trust the government. Therefore, we must not allow the people to see us as bureaucrats and give the enemy any opportunity to sow discord. He also advocated carrying out a poverty eradication movement, forcing those with assets to support the front lines in order to save the people from misery.</p>
<h3>Northeast Region慰劳團 Will Leave Ping for Shenyang Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th Dispatch] Fu Rulin, head of the Central Military慰劳團 Northeast Region團, and his party are scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 28th. It is reported that in addition to going to the Northeast, the group will also go to Rehe to offer慰勞.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 25th Dispatch] Liang Shangdong, deputy head of the Central Military慰劳團 Jin-Cha-Sui region團, and his party of nine arrived in Bing from Ping on the afternoon of the 25th and will return to Ping after staying for five or six days.</p>
<h3>Warships Patrol the Bohai Bay</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 26th Dispatch] In order to protect Tianjin and Tanggu, the naval authorities dispatched a team of warships to patrol the Bohai coast on the 8th. No Communist ships have been found in the past ten days. When passing Qikou, the ships did not land to search because the sea entrance was far from the shore. The US-made Mei Yi warship in the team arrived in Tianjin yesterday.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Chairman Chiang Will Fly to Ping</h3>
<p>Local Authorities Prepare the 行辕</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Official sources say that Chairman Chiang has not yet left Nanjing and will likely fly to Ping on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th Dispatch] According to Beiping newspapers on the 26th, it is rumored that the summer capital will be established in Beiping this year. This reporter inquired with the 行辕, the Sui Garrison Headquarters, and the Municipal Government, all of which said that as of now, apart from learning that Chairman Chiang will come to Ping, they have not received any instructions or notices regarding the summer capital. Therefore, while the local authorities are still arranging the 行辕 for the Chairman in the Hou Yu'en Temple area, they have not prepared another 行辕 for the Chairman in places such as the Summer Palace. One observer said that the summer capital is currently just a descriptive term and has not been institutionalized. Chairman Chiang is a symbol of the national political center. If the Chairman is in Ping in the summer, then Beiping will temporarily be the summer capital.</p>
<h3>Beiping 行辕 Road Protection Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th Dispatch] The Beiping 行辕 held a railway protection meeting on the morning of the 26th. Li Zongren, Wang Hongshao, Sun Lianzhong, Fu Zuoyi, Liu Guangji, commander of the Second War Zone Transportation, Shi Zhiren, director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, and Yang Yi, director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, all participated, and made some decisions on improving the current state of transportation, which is frequently damaged by Communist troops. The railway bureau hopes that military defense forces will be strengthened.</p>
<h3>Traffic Between Shenyang and Benxi Can Be Restored by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Panyang, 26th Dispatch] Southern Liaoning is peaceful. The Shenyang Railway Bureau is rushing to repair the damaged bridge holes northwest of Benxi. By the end of the month, trains from Shenyang can directly reach Benxi. There is a lack of materials between Benxi and South Gong, so traffic still needs to be restored.</p>
<h3>Fighting Resumes Outside Baoding; Most Communist Troops in the Northern Section of the Jinpu Railway Flee to Central Hebei</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 26th Dispatch] Fighting has resumed outside Baoding. A large number of Communist troops, returning to central Hebei from the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, formed a ring-shaped formation from the east, south, and north at 12:00 last night and fiercely attacked the provincial capital. Cannon fire and fighting continued throughout the night outside the first line of defense, ten li from the city. The clear sound of gunfire can be heard within the city. Various strongholds along the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, such as Caohe, Xushui, Gucheng, Beihe, and Dingxing, are also under attack and are also in battle.

<h3>Commemorating the Signing of the United Nations Charter Chairman Chiang's Broadcast to the World Reaffirms China's Ideal of Collective Security</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] To commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, Chairman Chiang delivered a broadcast to the world from 4:30 PM to 5:45 PM (Nanjing summer time) on the 26th. The original text is as follows: Today is the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, and I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words from the capital of China to peace-loving people around the world. In the past two years, the various important institutions stipulated in the United Nations Charter have been established one after another. The Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and its various committees and affiliated institutions have seen their responsibilities and activities gradually increase, indicating that the world's trust in the United Nations institutions is also growing rapidly.</p>
<p>I say this not to predict that permanent world peace is currently at hand. On the contrary, I am very aware that the arduous task of "building peace" is still ahead, and there are still many world issues that need to be handled fairly by the United Nations. However, if the member states of the United Nations are willing to put the interests of their own countries secondary for the happiness of the whole world, then these difficulties can still be overcome. In the past, during the San Francisco Conference, China boldly announced to the world that we were prepared to entrust part of our sovereignty to the new international organization for the sake of collective security. We also said that in order to achieve our common goals, we must be prepared to make some sacrifices. Today, I would like to declare to the world again that we still hold this ideal, and we believe that the realization of this ideal is the key to the success of the United Nations. Regarding this point, people around the world may be pleased to know that the Chinese Constitution, passed by the Chinese National Assembly in November of last year, specifically stipulates the upholding of the United Nations Charter in its chapter on foreign policy. I believe that among the member states of the United Nations, China is still the only country that has explicitly stipulated the upholding of the United Nations Charter in its constitution. But this is not a fundamental change in China's national policy. The ideal of "universal harmony" is China's inherent thought.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen, the father of the nation, also re-emphasized it as the ultimate goal of human civilization.</p>
<p>Today, I cannot but very sincerely commemorate my late friend President Roosevelt. His noble ideals were deeply moving and advanced the组 of the United Nations. President Roosevelt's contribution to serving humanity is worthy of our commemoration. I think the best way to commemorate him is for everyone to work together to make our United Nations an ever-existing, ever-growing institution.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Central Broadcasting Station recently received Chairman Chiang's speech, broadcasted during a special program commemorating the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in New York.

<h3>Wang Chong-Hui's Opinion on Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch] National Government Committee member Dr. Wang Chonghui stated to reporters regarding his opinion on current situation: Vice Chairman Sun's remarks the other day can quite represent the thoughts of the nation's citizens. China and the Soviet Union, as neighbors, should be friendly. Moreover, the diplomatic policies of both countries both view world peace as their goal. However, the enhancement of the relations between the two countries must come from the joint effort of both sides and must not come from only one party's responsibility. Regarding the Sino-Soviet Treaty, our country signed this treaty with the greatest resolution and with the greatest sacrifices, and the aim was nothing more than hoping that the two countries would be permanently friendly. To this day, our country has complied with this treaty without any violations and has the right to ask the Soviet Union to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the treaty with the same spirit. Regarding America's Far East policy, at the very least, it should be as proactive as its Europe policy and should give China continuous aid. America and Britain must understand that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty was based on the Yalta Secret Agreement between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union. The reason why our country endured sacrifices was to maintain peace in the Far East. America and Britain must know where their responsibilities lie and should not stand by and watch the situation in China. Otherwise, it is morally inexcusable. Therefore, our country should immediately ask America and Britain to participate in jointly seeking fair and reasonable resolutions to all problems between China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai's Talk That The Sino-Soviet Friendship Treaty Is Accepted Is Is Also Sincerely Wished To Be Fully Fulfilled</h3>
<p>[Reported] The Democratic Socialist Party held a special central committee meeting at its headquarters on Yuyuan Road yesterday afternoon from 3 PM, attended by ten committee members, chaired by Chairman Zhang Junmai, which adjourned at around 6 PM. The content of the discussion is unclear. After the meeting, Zhang Junmai entertained reporters. Asked for his thoughts on Vice Chairman Sun's recent remarks, Zhang said: "I was also one of those in favor when the Sino-Soviet Treaty was signed. Today, I hope this agreement can be faithfully fulfilled. Regarding Sino-Soviet questions, I hope that the government follows diplomatic channels and resolves them through open and honest negotiations with the Soviet Union." Regarding the American loan, Zhang believes that the 500 million US dollars will likely succeed and are currently being negotiated. "As long as our country improves its politics, increases production, and eliminates corruption, American aid to China will not be a problem." He also said: "The government has accepted the Political Consultative Council's peace proposal, and practical methods are being studied. At this time, there will be no order to suppress the Chinese Communists. If the government orders suppression, the Democratic Socialist Party will express a clear stance." Zhang also stated: He hopes that internal Can can be stopped as soon as possible. At present, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration requires both sides on the Yellow River to cease fire in order to build embankments, which concerns millions of lives and should be accepted. Asked whether he accepted the recent demands of overseas party members, Zhang said: "The Organization Committee convened last month was completely legal. The absence of overseas representatives has nothing to do with the quorum of the meeting. Therefore, the suggestion to reopen the Organization Committee cannot be accepted."</p>
<p>[Another News Report] Key members of the Democratic League have returned to Shanghai from Nanjing one after another and are scheduled to convene a central committee meeting at 9 AM today to study the current situation.

<h3>Outer Mongolia Issued a Reply in an Attempt to Conceal its Border Violation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Relevant sources have learned that the Outer Mongolian government, through its minister to Moscow, submitted a reply to our government's previous protest to Ambassador Fu Bingchang on the 22nd of this month. The content of the reply was telegraphed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by our embassy in the Soviet Union on the 24th. It is understood that the main points of its content are that the Outer Mongolian government believes that the Beitashan incident was caused by a border dispute and that the Outer Mongolian government believes that Beitashan is "within Outer Mongolian territory" and that Chinese troops had "invaded" the Outer Mongolian border, thus causing the conflict. Observers here believe that Outer Mongolia's statement, which distorts the facts and makes strong words to conceal its border violations, will make it more difficult to resolve the Beitashan incident. Furthermore, after the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia's replies to our protest were delivered to Nanjing one after another, the Foreign Affairs Authority is carefully studying and considering the situation.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Koo and Secretary Marshall Confer on China's Economic Situation, $500 Million Loan Awaiting Final Decision</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, met with Secretary of State Marshall for an hour on the afternoon of the 25th. According to Koo, the topic of the meeting was "various aspects of China's economic situation." Koo told reporters after the meeting that he and Secretary Marshall had reviewed various possibilities for future U.S. aid to China, but Koo did not mention the $500 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which will expire on June 30th. Koo also stated that China needs two types of loans: one is a long-term loan to promote China's economic recovery and construction, and the other is a short-term loan to stabilize China's current economic situation.范宣德, Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department of the U.S. State Department, was also present at today's meeting.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall stated today that the State Department is currently paying close attention to the entire situation in China on a daily basis, but he expressed doubt as to whether any action would be taken to extend the deadline (which expires on June 30th) for the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank earmarked for China. (Note that this earmarked loan must be used before the deadline). Secretary Marshall made these remarks in response to a reporter's question at a routine press conference this morning. The reporter reminded Secretary Marshall that the loan designated but not used for China would expire next Monday, so would any action be taken? Secretary Marshall then made the above simple comments, but did not provide details or reveal what details he was discussing with his advisors on a daily basis. He stated that any new action to extend the deadline for the loan to China must be handled by the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems, but after checking with the Treasury Department, it was learned that the issue of extending the deadline for the loan to China had not yet been submitted to the Advisory Council for consideration. Based on the general perception here, the loan to China will be allowed to expire under the U.S. government's stipulated deadline. That is, if China needs U.S. financial assistance, it must restart negotiations for a new loan. The U.S. National Advisory Council is the highest expert organization and has the final say on foreign loans allocated by the government. The Chairman of the Advisory Council is Secretary of the Treasury Snyder, with Secretary Marshall representing the State Department, Harriman representing the Department of Commerce, Martin representing the Export-Import Bank, and Ecoles representing the Federal Reserve. Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Koo Vi-kyuin, held consultations with Secretary Marshall at 3:00 p.m. on the 25th. The Export-Import Bank's allocated loans are based on individual projects and may provide other credit loans to various government agencies and private enterprises in China.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of the Treasury Snyder stated at a press conference here on the 25th that the reservation period for the $500 million loan designated by the Export-Import Bank for China will expire on June 30th, and there is no consideration to extend it or lend it to China before the expiration. Note that Snyder is the chairman of the National Advisory Council, which determines the U.S. government's foreign lending policy, and its decisions must be finalized by the President.</p>

<h3>Important Resolutions of the National Economic Council: Economic Reform Plan to be Submitted for Review First; Valuation of State-Owned Enterprises Limited to Completion Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The National Economic Council held its fifth meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, spending most of the time discussing the economic reform plan proposed by Premier Zhang. After Premier Zhang reported on the process of proposing the plan, Chen Lifu explained the main points, especially emphasizing that although it is an extraordinary period, we cannot fail to fundamentally plan for it because it is an extraordinary period. This plan is not a stopgap measure, but a fundamental plan. Under the current circumstances, if we do not do so, I am afraid it will be difficult to achieve anything. Chen pointed out that in the past, there was a bad trend in the financial world, namely, "not caring about agriculture, neglecting industry, and helping commerce," which led to the failure of the three to develop smoothly. This bad trend should be corrected so that industry and agriculture can flourish through financial regulation. After the report, the committee members spoke one after another, some in favor, some skeptical, and some advocating for modifications. It was generally acknowledged that the principles of this plan are very good, but where to start implementing it needs to be considered. It is also questionable whether it will be effective after implementation when the currency system is unstable. Some committee members believed that it is advisable to advance both fundamental and stopgap measures simultaneously during the current transitional period. In the end, it was decided that Chen Lifu and Xu Kan would be the conveners to hold a full review meeting within days to conduct further in-depth research on this plan. It is expected that at least three or four meetings will be held before submitting it to the general assembly or group deliberations.</p>
<p>In today's meeting, in addition to discussing the above issues, the valuation standards for state-owned enterprises were also decided. The main points are: in the future, valuation will be based on current prices, referring to the following four points as standards: (1) raw material supply, (2) location of the unit, (3) business development, (4) market demand, and it was decided to "speed up valuation and complete it within July."</p>
<p>The meeting also discussed the free buying and selling of gold. The National Goldsmiths Association's proposal to amend the management measures for the goldsmiths industry in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, which was submitted by the Executive Yuan for discussion, was unanimously considered to be (1) unnecessary under the current circumstances, (2) that the goldsmiths industry should primarily engage in the gold business as its name suggests, and (3) therefore, the number of unemployed people is not as high as rumored. It was resolved that the original measures would not be changed.</p>
<p>Regarding the simplification of tax collection, Xu Baiyuan made a report, and Premier Zhang believed that it could be handled temporarily if it did not affect tax revenue.</p>
<p>Today's meeting was chaired by Premier Zhang, with committee members Sun Longji, Li Jingzhai, Huang Yuanbin, Wang Xiaolai, Lou Tongsun, Pan Xulun, Xue Dubi, Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, Jian Guansan, Wu Yunjie, Liu Jianqun, Xu Kan, Wang Yunwu, Liu Zhendong, Chen Lifu, Deng Feihuang, Chen Fang, Xiao Zheng, and Gu Zhenggang attending.

During the discussion, some committee members believed that this matter was far from being an economic emergency measure plan. Some committee members had many complaints about telephones. Finally, Sun Jiulu proposed that this postal and telecommunications price increase is based on the "Revised Measures for Subsidizing State-Operated and State-Run Enterprises," and this case is part of the overall fiscal policy, involving increasing the people's burden and affecting price increases. It is proposed to invite Premier Zhang and Minister Yu Dawei to the Legislative Yuan to explain the process of changing the entire policy and the implementation of the budget in the past six months.

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Speaks on the Issue of Opening Trade with Japan, China's Various Trade Regulations Still Apply</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Since the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan announced that it plans to open private trade with Japan in the short term, people in the country have been very concerned. A spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently made a statement on this matter, saying that the rumor that this matter may be realized in July is probably just speculation from various parties. The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers has stipulated that relevant countries must be notified some time in advance before opening private trade with Japan. At least until now, our country has not received such a notification. Therefore, the statement in a few newspapers that 36 merchants have been designated to specialize in trade with Japan and that registration has already been carried out is not true. As for whether there will still be some restrictions on import and export merchants after the opening of trade, according to what the Ministry knows, it may not be absolutely free.

There are also 150 units that can be announced for auction, and 160 units that are pending valuation for auction. According to central government regulations, all property received from the Governor-General's Office and its subordinate agencies is public property, and enemy property that is found and hidden cannot be used as compensation.</p>

<h3>Tomb of Fallen Soldiers at the Foot of Hongshan Mountain in Wuchang is Reconstructed and Completed</h3>
<p>[Wuchang News] At the foot of Hongshan Mountain in Wuchang is the tomb of the fallen soldiers of the 1st Army and 2nd Division. In 1926, when the National Revolutionary Army vowed to launch the Northern Expedition, General Liu Zhi served as the commander of the 2nd Division of the 1st Army and led his troops to attack Wuchang City.

Nearly 200 heroes were sacrificed and buried here afterwards. At the beginning of last month, General Liu visited Hankou. As soon as he was settled, he went to pay his respects with his old subordinates Peng Jinzhi, Feng Qian, and Zou Guyu. When he arrived, the place was overgrown with weeds and the monuments were dilapidated. He recalled the past and felt sad. He then funded the reconstruction to comfort the loyal souls. Now it has been completed, and the scene has been renewed, adding color to the landscape.</p>

<h3>The Zhen'an County Massacre in Shaanxi: Chang'an District Court Holds Public Trial</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 25th] The shocking massacre in Zhen'an County, southern Shaanxi, where the County Council Speaker was shot and killed by the County Magistrate leading the county government's armed forces, was publicly tried for the first time in the Chang'an District Court yesterday at 8:00 AM. Despite the expansion of the gallery, it was still overcrowded. The judge and the main figure in the massacre, Sun Junbo, the former County Magistrate, were both sweating profusely. The investigation hearing was held all day yesterday. All fifteen lawyers attended, and Sun and the accused, as well as witnesses, were examined one after another. There were loopholes in the testimonies of all parties, and the trial will continue in the next few days. The charges brought by the prosecutor include: First, Sun's crime of forcing female teacher Wang Huimin to cohabitate, violating public morals and freedom. Wang died of poisoning in April, but her father accused Sun of poisoning her, a point the prosecutor has not yet acknowledged. Second, the crime of shooting and killing four people. Because the County Council repeatedly reported Sun's corruption and illegal activities, and the Wang case was exposed, Sun suspected that the Council was instigating it. Therefore, on May 2nd, he falsely reported that communists had infiltrated, declared martial law, and then led a team to shoot and kill Council Speaker Li Weihan and three other staff members at Li's residence. He then deployed police to pursue and kill a witness outside the city. Third, the crime of detaining a telegraph office employee for more than ten days for sending a telegram to Li's residence, obstructing freedom. The prosecutor believes that the first two charges involve abuse of power and strongly advocates for a heavier sentence. However, some speculate that Sun has favorable evidence, coupled with other reasons, so he may not be sentenced to death. The councils of more than ten counties in Shaanxi have sent telegrams urging strict punishment, and the Shaanxi Inspector has also reported the case.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Decisions the United States Must Make</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published an editorial on the 21st titled "Who Abandoned Whom?" The gist of the entire article is: "China has not been abandoned by the United States, but China has failed to obtain American aid through sound business principles, and instead abandoned the United States. Taking the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan as an example, the bank has been holding the funds for months, and the reason is that, from all perspectives, it can be seen that China would rather obtain a 'political loan' without the borrower controlling the use of the funds, than to carefully calculate what the country truly needs and formulate a sound and beneficial plan." This editorial can be seen as a suggestion from others that could help one improve themselves: the Chinese government authorities may also use it to reflect on their own actions. However, the newspaper also said: "If they acknowledge that foreign aid cannot be blindly given in the future, if they believe that the Chinese people cannot produce good results from foreign political loans and feel hopeless, then there is still hope; but if they act like crying babies and beggars, the result will only be failure and will be despised by those of their own countrymen who do not want to act in this way." This passage not only sees China's request for assistance from the United States as purely driven by selfish motives but also misunderstands the current political situation in China. Therefore, this newspaper's editorial on the 22nd, "The United States Should Make Wise Decisions Sooner Rather Than Later," in addition to pointing out that the development of the Far Eastern situation to this degree has forced the United States to make a wise choice between fully assisting or completely abandoning China in its future China policy; at the same time, it also corrected the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury's incorrect views on Chinese politics. Unexpectedly, the newspaper published another editorial on the 25th titled "Must the United States Assist or Withdraw?" There are many misunderstandings and distortions of this newspaper's editorial, so we cannot remain silent and must reiterate our explanation:</p>
<p>First, our request that the United States government make a wise decision regarding the Far East is not out of a threatening attitude. We are not telling the United States: If you do not fully assist China, then we want the United States to withdraw completely. The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury misunderstood this point from the start, perhaps due to an error by the translator. Therefore, the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury asked: Does China, because of its emphasis on commerce over righteousness, have a movement demanding that the United States withdraw from China? We believe that this question is unnecessary, at least for the moment, there is not the slightest anti-American sentiment in the minds of the Chinese people; the relations between China and the United States have always been very friendly and close; before the War of Resistance, China was oppressed and invaded by imperialism and fell into a semi-colonial status. Only the United States had no political or territorial ambitions towards China, not only sympathizing with China but also treating us on an equal footing everywhere. The balance of power of the great powers in China also relied entirely on the United States' firm implementation of its so-called "Open Door," "China's Territorial and Sovereign Integrity" policies. When the War of Resistance broke out, the United States was the first to condemn Japan's aggression and brutality and insisted on its "Non-Recognition Doctrine." Later, the Pacific War broke out, and China and the United States became allies with common destiny. After this baptism of blood, the two countries became friends in need, and the relationship between the two countries naturally became closer. Therefore, after the end of the war, China encountered great obstacles due to the Communist Party's problems in receiving, repatriating, and sending back enemy prisoners. The United States still upheld its friendly spirit, assisting China in repatriation and sending back Japanese prisoners. At the same time, General Marshall, for the peaceful unification of China, did not hesitate to travel to China to serve as a mediator. Within a year, he traveled for peace, without rest, and climbed Mount Lu eight times in the scorching summer. Although he failed to turn conflict into amity, General Marshall's hard work was deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Chinese person and can never be forgotten. Although the Communist Party has repeatedly attempted to incite the people against the United States, the result has always been failure, which shows that the bond of friendship between the people of China and the United States cannot be destroyed by any force. This newspaper's editorial has also consistently promoted Sino-US cooperation to promote the political, economic, and cultural relations between the two countries. Second, the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury has always believed that the United States is unwilling to grant loans to China due to China's internal maladministration. The newspaper once stated: "Some believe that the United States has adopted the Truman Doctrine for European countries and a 'cold' attitude towards continuing to assist China. This view is nothing short of insulting to the United States. In fact, the United States is deeply concerned about China, but not limited to communism. Moreover, it is even more concerned that the government recognized by the United States not only cannot effectively oppose communism but also sometimes inevitably adopts the Communist Party's centralization and exclusion policies. China should consider the second chapter of the Truman Doctrine, which is Secretary of State Marshall's European Economic Recovery Plan. This step is also what Americans want to implement in China. The US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan has been debated a lot. What significance can be said to exist? But as of now, China has not been able to obtain this loan." The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury has a long history of publication in Shanghai, and its hosts have also been in China for many years and are known as "China problem experts" in the United States. The editorials they publish daily on Sino-US relations have always been valued by the Chinese government and public. However, after reading them, we cannot help but feel that "foreigners have different views." The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury should face reality squarely regarding China's current political situation, especially understand the environment in which the Chinese government is in, and cannot ignore the feelings and wishes of the majority of our people. There is no absolute standard for the merits of politics. In any case, we resolutely do not admit that China's current politics is inferior to that of Greece and other countries. The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury's misjudgment of Chinese politics makes us unable to avoid regret.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of Sino-US relations, after the war, the relationship between China and the United States has become increasingly close, and the cultural exchanges between the two countries have become smoother. In theory, there should be no more gaps and misunderstandings between China and the United States, especially for American newspapers that have been in Shanghai for many years. We have repeatedly pointed out in editorials that China's request for assistance from the United States is by no means out of selfish motives, but China's need for American assistance is formed by the objective conditions of the global situation. Secretary of State Marshall announced yesterday that the deadline for the $500 million loan will expire at the end of this month and will not be extended. China is determined not to accept "charity" from the United States and will have other "ways to regenerate itself." However, the consequences of the United States not assisting China are worth the attention and consideration of the American government and public. Although we will not demand or force the United States to withdraw completely, the end result of the United States' implementation of its current policies, regardless of whether it is willing or not, will eventually be that it has to withdraw completely one day. As Vice Chairman Sun said: "The United States' cold response is equivalent to abandoning China." Therefore, we believe that if there are far-sighted politicians in the United States who do not haggle over the petty calculations of merchants, they will be able to make new decisions regarding the Far Eastern situation, which is on the verge of crisis. American journalists who are in the Far East and personally witness the increasingly serious situation in the Far East should adopt a detached attitude, be impartial, report the real situation and the feelings of the local people to the American people, and make timely appeals to arouse the attention of the American people. This is the only way to fulfill the responsibilities of a journalist!</p>

<h3>Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to Confer on Marshall Plan; Foreign Ministers' Conference Opens Today; Bevin and Molotov Arrive in Paris; Snyder Says Dollar Economic Aid to Europe a Definite Obligation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 26th] British Foreign Minister Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived here today one after another from their respective countries and will confer with French Foreign Minister Bidault tomorrow on US Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European recovery. Accompanying Mr. Bevin was Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov. British and French figures alike believe that the Soviet Union's agreement to discuss the Marshall Plan is an encouraging sign, but the harsh criticism in yesterday's Pravda in Moscow has slightly discouraged those who were optimistic in the past. Poland's expression of concern about the Marshall Plan is also quite important, as Polish coal is a major factor in any European recovery plan. At the same time, on the eve of the tripartite foreign ministers' conference, the United States further assured Europe that it would back the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Treasury Secretary and Chairman of the National Advisory Council Snyder stated at a press conference today that the Marshall Plan does not place a definite obligation on the United States to provide financial assistance to Europe or any other part of the world. Answering a reporter's question, Mr. Snyder said: The National Advisory Council (the President's advisory body that decides on plans for foreign loans) has not drafted and does not plan to implement Marshall's aid plan. When asked if Marshall wanted to invite European countries to apply for this assistance when necessary, he replied, "That is not the intention." Snyder's words have caused general surprise. Secretary Marshall's speech at Harvard University did not mention dollar aid, only stating that the US's mission was to "help draft a European plan in a friendly manner, and then see what is actually needed and submit this plan." If a strict interpretation is given to Marshall's words, Snyder's words are reasonable. However, based on the subsequent remarks of other State Department officials, such as State Department Legal Counsel Cohen's statement that the US may have to approve loans of 30 billion yuan in the next four years, both American and European figures believe that Marshall's original proposal was a definite obligation, albeit with conditions attached. Mr. Snyder further stated at today's press conference: "My interpretation of Marshall's plan is that Marshall is inviting European countries to engage in self-reliance and observe what they can do for themselves." The reporter then asked Snyder: "Then does Your Excellency believe that in Marshall's words, the United States did not suggest engaging in any assistance?" Mr. Snyder replied: "We have no other evidence to prove that this suggestion was made other than what we already know."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Treasury Secretary Snyder, in order to clarify his remarks made at the morning press conference, met with reporters again in the afternoon and explained: My view of the Marshall Plan is that it does not invite other countries to seek American economic assistance. This statement does not mean that I disagree with Marshall's suggestion to revive Europe. What Secretary of State Marshall said at Harvard University was that the United States could help Europe to get on the road to recovery, but first, European countries need to coordinate their basic needs and set a suitable foundation before applying for assistance to the United States. I believe that this means that Europe should first check its inventory and develop itself. What I said at the press conference was to state this explanation, indicating that reviving Europe may require American assistance.</p>
<h3>Three Countries Hold Preliminary Discussions; Other Countries Do Not Participate for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 25th] Well-informed sources here have recently said that the foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France will begin a meeting on the 27th to discuss the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe. It is not yet possible for representatives of other countries to participate in the meeting. However, after the three foreign ministers' conference has drafted a work plan, it may first consult the opinions of other countries, and then a final decision can be made on the European economic recovery plan.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 25th] The Polish Ambassador to France, Traman, visited French Deputy Foreign Minister Mouville today and told him that he would soon be ordered to be responsible for arranging everything for Poland's participation in the tripartite foreign ministers' conference. Poland is very concerned about the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] Czech diplomatic sources here said that Haas, the counselor of the Czech Embassy, visited Sampr, the economic assistant of the State Department, today and told him that Czechoslovakia was interested in the Marshall Plan. At that time, Sampr strongly stated: (1) This plan does not reject any country; (2) The first step is that European countries should be responsible for achieving coordination, which is a necessary condition for the success of this plan. However, Hahn did not inform Sampr of Czechoslovakia's intention to join this plan, only expressing that the Czech Republic was interested. Regarding the Polish ambassador's expression of willingness to join, this is probably because Poland has suffered more war damage than the Czech Republic, so it urgently needs assistance.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 25th] Well-informed sources here have recently said that if Italy can approve the treaty with Italy as soon as possible, France is willing to support Italy's participation in future negotiations on the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Frankfurt, Germany, 25th] The mayor of Frankfurt, Scharde, hosted a banquet today for the members of the newly established German Economic Council in the British and American occupation zones. During the banquet, Mayor Scharde said: Germany hopes to participate in the discussions on the Marshall Aid Plan for Europe, and hopes that the establishment of the German Economic Council will be the first step towards German unification. Without foreign assistance, it would be difficult to realize Germany's economic recovery.</p>
<h3>Pravda Comments on the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] A Moscow broadcast of an article carried in "Pravda" stated that if the Marshall Plan is a anti-communist lasso, it will inevitably be rejected by all "self-respecting" countries in Europe, but Britain is now symbolizing its readiness to proceed even without the participation of the Soviet Union. If the Marshall Plan is based on the principle of American aid to the Greek and Turkish plan, it is destined to fail. The general nature of the Marshall Plan is unknown, so the Soviet Union cannot judge whether it is intended to solve European problems or to arrange an ideological war between capitalism and communism. The main task of the Paris Conference is to determine the degree of Soviet cooperation. If the Marshall Plan is still the same as the aid to the Greek and Turkish plan and is anti-communist in nature, then this assistance is an interference in the internal affairs and sovereignty of European countries, so all European countries with self-respect should reject it.</p>
<h3>French Reaction to Snyder's Remarks</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 25th] According to a Washington dispatch, US Treasury Secretary Snyder said during a press conference that the Marshall Plan does not mean that the United States will give more assistance to Europe. The diplomatic community here is very puzzled and incredulous about this. The diplomatic community here believes that Snyder's intention is to appease American public opinion before calculating the cost of the plan. However, according to an official here, "If Snyder's words are true, it may cause the tripartite conference and the entire plan to die before they are implemented."</p>
<h3>US Will Not Send Observers to Attend Paris Conference</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Washington, 25th] US Secretary of State Marshall recently told reporters that the US government does not intend to send observers to Paris to attend the meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to discuss the US aid plan for Europe.</p>
<h3>US Labor Strikes Expand; Steel Production Affected</h3>
<p>Hartley Says He Will Seek to Deal With It</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 26th] 40,000 shipyard workers at nine shipyards of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation on the US East Coast officially began a strike at 12:01 AM this morning. At the same time, steel production in the United States has been affected by the strike of 250,000 soft coal miners protesting the new labor law. Republican Congressman Hartley, the author of the new labor law, said last night that he would strengthen the effectiveness of the bill to deal with Lewis and the coal mine strike.</p>
<h3>Romanian Government Deprives People of Freedom; US Lodges Serious Protest; Condemns This Act as a Violation of Treaty Obligations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The US government has, through its political representative in the Romanian capital, Melbourne, lodged a strongly worded note with Romanian Foreign Minister Tatarescu, protesting the deprivation of civil liberties of the Romanian people, and stating that the US government is deeply concerned about these developments. It further pointed out that these developments are sufficient to undermine the fulfillment of the responsibilities stipulated in the Romanian Treaty. The note stated, "I am fully instructed by my government to declare to Your Excellency that the United States government expresses serious concern over the deprivation of civil liberties of the Romanian people, especially regarding the arbitrary arrest of hundreds of opposition party and non-partisan figures without arrest warrants or charges, as well as the indefinite imprisonment of these arrested persons in prisons and concentration camps in harsh conditions." The note then refuted the statement made by the Romanian Minister of Interior last month, claiming that "in a situation of provocative or secret activities, these measures are necessary to maintain internal security," pointing out that it was a deliberate act to suppress or intimidate democratic elements who oppose the current regime in Romania. The note further pointed out that this deprivation of the most basic human rights and freedoms is in violation of Article 3 of the treaty signed by the Romanian government.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] Representative Hall, who will soon protest to the Romanian government against the arrest of Romanian opposition figures, said that the nature of the protest is similar to the US protest to Romania.</p>

<h3>Eisenhower Expresses Full Support for Western Hemisphere Defense Plan; Emphasizes the Importance of Pan-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 25th Special Dispatch] U.S. Chief of Staff General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned today that in another world war, the primary target of attack may be the vast North American industrial area around the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River Valley of the United States. Eisenhower made this statement in Congress in support of President Truman's proposal for close military cooperation in the Western Hemisphere, including the unified deployment and training of troops. He stated that unless the United States assists other American countries in developing their military construction, these countries will eventually lean towards other foreign countries. Eisenhower also stated that he does not believe South America will be a battlefield in any future war, as no country in the world can land troops on the coasts of South America by force under the strong defense of the Americas. He recommended that Congress maintain the Western Hemisphere Defense Plan until the United States trusts the United Nations. Navy Secretary Forrestal informed Congress that the Navy Department is prepared to transfer the remaining new-style warships to Latin American countries after the Western Hemisphere Joint Defense Act is enacted, so that the latter can assist in the Western Hemisphere joint defense and protect the Panama Canal in the event of an aggression crisis.</p>

<p>U.S. President's Speech</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, 26th] In a broadcast to the world commemorating the second anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Charter, President Truman pledged that the United States will do its utmost to ensure the success of the United Nations. He also stated that "the strength of the United Nations organization lies in the recognition by all member states of the fact that, regardless of all disputes, they have a common goal of maintaining international peace and promoting international security. However, the United Nations organization is still in its infancy, and there are many difficulties. Various international issues cannot be easily resolved at once. The effectiveness of the United Nations organization lies in the member states complying with the Charter, not only should they implement the decisions of the organization, but their foreign relations should also be based on the principles of freedom and justice stipulated in the Charter."</p>
<p>British Prime Minister's Speech</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Attlee said in his speech, "The governments and peoples of all countries must work together to make the United Nations organization work. The Charter is not perfect, but if it is applied well, it is the most reliable way to establish lasting peace internationally. The disputes in the Security Council do not need to be given excessive attention. If we can maintain the unity of wartime in peacetime, then everything can be solved easily."</p>
<p>French Prime Minister's Speech</p>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 26th] French Prime Minister Ramadier said in his broadcast speech that the Charter Day is "the national day of the world." He stated that although Europe and Asia are still deeply scarred after a huge war, and although various difficulties have arisen due to the different viewpoints and direct interests between countries, the mission of the United Nations has been increasing daily. The United Nations Charter is the modern church of rights and international justice.</p>
<p>Soviet Representative's Speech</p>
<p>[United Press Lake Success, 26th] Soviet Representative Gromyko said in his speech that one of the most important principles of the United Nations is the principle of great power unanimity in dealing with important issues of maintaining peace.</p>
<p>This principle is related to the fundamental interests of all countries, large and small, and has been fully tested by the Allied countries in resisting the common enemy. We have reason to believe that this principle can also withstand the test of establishing lasting peace conditions after the war. The period of two years is extremely short. At present, we cannot conclude the success or failure of the United Nations. It is best for us to look forward more and not look back. We should pay more attention to the important issues that have not yet been resolved. He hopes that the United Nations will eventually overcome all difficulties and become a truly effective weapon for people all over the world to strive for peace and security.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Takes Another Unilateral Action; Japan to Mine on Palau Islands; First Overseas Colonization by Japanese After the War</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that the Japanese government will be responsible for managing the phosphate mines on Angaur Island from July 1st. The island is located 300 miles east of Mindanao Island and was occupied by the U.S. military after a bloody battle in 1944. According to a representative here, the permission for the Japanese to return to Angaur Island was not discussed with other countries and seems to be a unilateral action by MacArthur or the U.S. government. There are already 354 Japanese people on the island, and another 193 people will continue to go there, bringing the total number to exceed all Americans. The island's phosphate mines are mined by the Bamiro Company of San Francisco and supervised by the U.S. Navy. After the Japanese government takes over, it may lease the mines to Japanese private companies.</p>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Phosphate production on Angaur Island in the former Japanese-mandated Palau Islands is now entrusted to Japan under the supervision of the Allied Headquarters. This is the first time that Japanese people have gone abroad to colonize after the war. Angaur Island produces 191,000 tons of phosphate annually, which is a major source of fertilizer for Japan.</p>

<h3>Japanese Scholar's Wild Delusions; Actually Claims That China Expects Japan to Lead</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 26th] Dr. Komiya Yoshihiko, a former member of the Shanghai Scientific Research Association, recently wrote an article in the current issue of "New China" magazine, advocating that the United States will assist Japan's economic recovery, and Japan will assist China's economic recovery. It is said that Japan's aid to China is based on three reasons: (1) Japan is more advanced than China in applied science. (2) China has historically sent students to Japan, sometimes up to 30,000 people, most of whom study law, politics, economics, and practical sciences such as medicine. Chinese students go to Japan because they cannot afford to go to Europe, and they believe that Japan is the base of Western science and culture in the Far East. (3) Japan has not only invested huge amounts of capital in China, building railways, factories, mines, and shipping companies, but has also sent a large number of experts to carry out these projects. The most important investment is</p>
<p>China has fully recognized the major role of Japanese science in the development and progress of Chinese culture. Japan's defeat in the Pacific War has not stopped the Chinese from expecting Japan's leadership. In the future, when China rebuilds its economy and finds that it urgently needs technical assistance, it will inevitably call on Japanese experts to assist.</p>

<h3>McNutt Warns the United States Not to Hastily Rebuild Japan; Merchant Decides to Allow Japanese Antarctic Whaling</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 25th] Former U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt recently warned: "Do not rebuild Japan before other Eastern countries that fought side by side with the United States have restored their independence." He said in a speech to the Chicago Midwest Branch of the Far East and American Industrial and Commercial Association: "No matter how much we promote the implementation of democracy by the Japanese, if we do not solve the problems of the entire Eastern countries, we will recreate a military aggressive machine that conflicts with our interests." He reiterated his warning: "If we leave Japan when its economic power is very strong, making it the center of the economically weak nations of the Far East, then we must prepare for World War III as soon as possible."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall told the press today that the United States will still allow Japanese whaling ships to go to the Antarctic Ocean, despite the opposition of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Norway. Marshall said that one of the reasons for the opposition of the four countries is that Japan disregards international whaling rules, but the Japanese whaling team for the 1947-48 season will be ordered to strictly abide by all rules. Britain protested and said that the Japanese whaling team could become the core of the country's rebuilding navy. Marshall pointed out that the ships driven by the Japanese carried Japanese soldiers back to their country all over the world, and they stopped in many ports of the United Nations along the way, and no incidents occurred. The second Japanese whaling can directly save the United States more than 13 million U.S. dollars in occupation fees, and the proceeds from the sale of whale oil can subsidize approximately 6 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. Marshall expressed his approval for the statement issued by MacArthur's headquarters approving the second Japanese whaling.</p>

<h3>Former Disturbance at the Social Affairs Bureau; Two Groups of Workers in Vicious Fight; Petition of Hand-Operated Group Workers in the Knitting Industry in the Second District Has Twists and Turns; Many Injured and Eleven Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Report] More than 10,000 male and female workers in the hand-operated knitting machine group in the city's 1st, 2nd, and 3rd districts previously had disputes over index issues and had disputes with the employers. Workers in the 1st and 3rd districts reached an agreement with the employers, but the 2nd district has not yet resolved the issue, and the workers have been on strike for many days. Yesterday, workers in the 2nd district learned that Zheng Fangxiong, chairman of the district union, had suddenly disappeared the night before. They formed a team to petition the General Labor Union, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Municipal Government. Along the way, they clashed with Wang Sibin, chairman of the 1st District Labor Union, and director Pan Lindi, and both sides were injured.</p>
<p>Last year, due to the shallow business of the knitting industry, the labor and management parties agreed that the wages for the current month would be issued at 85% of the index for the previous month. Later, the index was unfrozen from May. The labor and management parties in the 1st and 3rd districts agreed to issue May's wages in accordance with the agreement, based on the frozen index of 794, plus 5 times, plus a difference of 117,000 yuan and one dou of rice. Workers in the 2nd district demanded that the wages be issued in accordance with the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau, based on the assumed index of 14,800 times 85% in April. The employers in the 2nd district stated that they could not accept this and applied for arbitration. May's wages were delayed, and the workers went on strike. The workers in the 1st and 3rd districts had already reached an agreement and continued to work as usual, which caused discord among the three unions.</p>
<p>At 11:00 am yesterday, the Second District Labor Union gathered more than 1,000 people to petition the General Labor Union, distributing a declaration stating that the chairman of the association, Jia Fangxiong, was resented by the employers. At 9:00 pm on the 25th, Feng Hua, who claimed to be a reporter for the Southeast Daily, and Xu Yongjie, a reporter for the China News Agency, invited him to room 419 of the Xiangsheng Hotel. He disappeared after going there. Later, it was found that there was no such room number in the Xiangsheng Hotel, and the Southeast Daily and other newspapers did not have these two reporters. It was obvious that they were impersonating people to deceive and secretly arrest him, so they demanded that the authorities thoroughly investigate. When they arrived at the General Labor Union, the person in charge happened to be absent, so they turned to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. On the way through the Changrong Hosiery Factory, they met Pan Lindi, director of the First District Labor Union. The two sides had a verbal conflict, and then started fighting. Pan was injured in his hands, chest, and other places. Later, they met Wang Sibin, chairman of the First District Labor Union, on Zhonghua Road, and another conflict broke out. Wang usually carries a handgun. When the two sides argued, Wang accused the petitioners of robbing his handgun, while the workers accused Wang of threatening them with a gun. Wang was eventually outnumbered and held hostage by the petitioning crowd and went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition together. More than 20 of Wang's friends rushed to rescue him, and the two sides fought again in front of the Social Affairs Bureau. On the First District side, Wang Sibin, Pan Lindi, and others were injured. According to the Second District Labor Union, seven people were stabbed with knives and were seriously injured, and several others were slightly injured. The Songshan Police Station heard the news and sent police to the scene to suppress the fighting, and at the same time sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. At that time, the person in charge of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau was absent and promised to reply the next day. The workers then turned to the Municipal Government to petition. Mayor Wu was out on business and was received by Secretary-General Shen, who instructed him to send a representative to meet with the mayor this morning.</p>
<p>Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, expressed suspicion about Zheng Fangxiong's disappearance. He also said that he would report to Mayor Wu about the Second District's holding of workers in the First District for a strike and leading the beatings, and that he would severely punish those who caused the incident.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Those detained at the Songshan Police Station at that time included Wang Sibin, Hu Yuanle, Tao Wenlong, Xu Xiting, Xu Hongsheng, Zhang Huiming, Shen Guorong, Wang Xinbao, Xue Ruhua, Liu Xiulan, and Chen Futai, a total of eleven people.</p>
<h3>This Month's Rice Allocation for Impoverished Households Determined at 60,400 "Shi" (石, a unit of dry measure) – Exact Amounts for Each District to be Announced Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee held its second meeting yesterday morning at the Bar Association's premises, presided over by Chairman Wu Kai-sien. Several important cases were discussed and resolved: (1) Rice Allocation for Impoverished Households: The Social Affairs Bureau had previously instructed district public offices to investigate and report the exact number of impoverished households and submit a register. As of the 25th, only the Huangpu district had submitted theirs. In order to expedite the process, it was decided that this month's rice allocation for impoverished households would be 60,400 "shi," with the principle of one "dou" (斗, another unit of dry measure, smaller than "shi") for a large family and five "sheng" (升, smaller than "dou") for a small family. It is estimated that one-seventh of the city's population will benefit from this allocation. The Allocation Committee has already drafted the figures for rice to be distributed to each district, which will be based on the population ratio of each district, with adjustments made according to the level of poverty in the area. After receiving notification of the allocated amounts from the Allocation Committee, each district should exclude impoverished households who have already received rice from factories, schools, or public educators during the investigation. The detailed figures for the rice allocated to each district will be announced today after Chairman Wu approves them. This rice will be sold by the district public offices through designated public sales points in the future.</p>
<p>Professional Workers – 120,000 "Shi"</p>
<p>(2) Rice allocation for professional workers will begin in July. It is estimated that there are approximately 600,000 workers in the city, requiring 120,000 "shi" of rice. The distribution method will be divided into two types: (A) Professional workers without fixed employers, such as dockworkers, rickshaw pullers, and carpenters, can apply to the Allocation Committee through their respective trade unions without having to create a register. The Allocation Committee will issue rice purchase certificates based on the existing union registers from the Social Affairs Bureau. (B) Professional workers with fixed employers, such as those who provide their own meals, can have their respective industry associations apply to the Allocation Committee on their behalf. Those whose meals are provided by the employer will not be eligible for allocation. (3) Approximately five or six thousand small handicraft factories throughout the city will also be included as eligible recipients. Workers belonging to factories with the "factory" designation on their "Guan Shang" (管商, 'managed business') business registration certificates or temporary receipts of business registration applications issued by the Social Affairs Bureau can apply through the industrial unions they belong to. After the unions verify the applications, they will be responsible for creating a register to be submitted to the Allocation Committee for review and rice allocation. If there is no union organization, the factory owner can apply for allocation.</p>
<p>Deadline for Payment at the End of the Month</p>
<p>According to Secretary Zhang Chude of the committee, the Ministry of Food has allocated a total of 187,000 "shi" of rice to the city for June. Currently, approximately 80,000 "shi" have been approved for rice allocation to factories and schools. After deducting 60,400 "shi" for impoverished households, the remaining 40,000 "shi" will be used to supplement the insufficient allocation for professional workers in July. All applicant units that have been approved to receive payment orders this month will have their applications invalidated if they do not pay and receive the rice before the end of the month. In order to simplify the payment procedures, the Allocation Committee has also arranged for cashiers from the City Bank to be stationed at the committee from the 26th to accept cash in addition to bank drafts. Other City Bank branches will not accept payments.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Concerned About Prices – Makes Remarks to Reporters – Determined to Eradicate Black Market for Gold and Currency – Further Investigates Warehouse Cotton Stock – Retail Price of Fresh Meat May Be Agreed Upon Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, there have been signs of price fluctuations in the city. Mayor Wu is very concerned and met with reporters from various newspapers in the city government conference room at 4:30 PM yesterday to report on specific measures to crack down on the black market for gold and currency, thoroughly investigate warehouse cotton stocks, increase rice allocation as much as possible, and suppress fresh meat prices, as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Economic Investigation Team announced its dissolution recently, transferring its work to the city government, many speculators believe that the city government may relax its investigation and crackdown efforts, so they have been secretly engaging in transactions, causing the black market to rise sharply. In fact, the city government is determined to carry out the crackdown on the black market with all its strength, mobilizing all senior officials from the city government's police bureau and social affairs bureau, and working with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to find ways to completely eradicate the black market for gold and currency. Two measures have now been decided: (1) It is hoped that citizens will report as much as possible. The city government will strictly keep the names of informants confidential. (2) The informant's reward will be issued quickly to encourage them.</p>
<p>Strictly Punish Cotton Yarn Speculation and Increase Rice Allocation</p>
<p>The cotton yarn issue is also very important. The city government will maintain close contact with the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee at all times. In order to curb speculation, a second warehouse investigation will be conducted. If there is collusion with hoarding, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the City's Civil Food Allocation Committee, the amount of rice allocated has increased every month. The amount for next month will be slightly higher than this month, and after August, 300,000 "zu" (租, a unit) of rice can be allocated each month, so there is absolutely no need to panic about the rice supply.</p>
<p>The price of vegetables in the city rose sharply near the Dragon Boat Festival, and now it has fallen back slightly. The city government is paying close attention to this and is striving to control market prices. The wholesale price of pork in the city is 7,000 yuan per "jin" (斤, a unit of weight), while the retail price has reached 11,000 yuan, which is unreasonable. Mayor Wu met with the person in charge of the fresh meat industry and the meat industry association yesterday, ordering the fresh meat industry association to convene a meeting of members today to agree on a retail price and strictly abide by it. In the future, fresh meat should be sold immediately after arriving in Shanghai, and violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Reports of an 80% Increase in Prices Are Absolutely Untrue</p>
<p>After Mr. Wu finished his report, reporters asked several questions, which Mr. Wu answered as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The English-language North China Daily News reported that the price increase in the city this month has reached 80%. Is this true? Mr. Wu replied: Absolutely not true. Rice and cotton can be taken as examples. (2) After the dissolution of the Economic Investigation Team, will the city government establish another organization to specialize in its duties? Mr. Wu said: There is no need for this. Senior officials such as city government counselors and experts will participate in the work. The allocation of work will be discussed at today's municipal meeting. (5) The Civil Food Allocation Committee's start-up costs were 80 million yuan and its operating expenses were 200 million yuan, but it has only allocated 20,000 "shi" of rice, which does not seem very economical. Are there any plans to improve this? Mr. Wu replied: The Allocation Committee has actually allocated 40,000 "dan" (担, a unit of weight) of rice, and will continue to increase it in the future. Because the committee is newly established, there have been delays in the procedures, and those who receive rice often delay the time of picking up the rice. He has now instructed Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to order the rice merchants to pick up the rice within three days, and those who fail to do so will be automatically forfeited, in order to expedite the process.</p>

<h3>Collection of National Construction Donation – More Reasonable in Large Cities</h3>
<p>Xi Yushu Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>[Our Report] Mr. Xi Yushu recently expressed his opinion on the proposed collection of the National Construction Donation: It is very reasonable to collect the National Construction Donation in large cities, because there are not many properties in small cities whose value reaches the tax threshold. However, it is very difficult to make the collection fair and reasonable. First of all, China has no property registration in the past, and it is difficult to perfect it in a hurry now. Wealth such as gold bars and securities can be hidden to evade taxes, so if only real estate is targeted, it is unfair, and the income from this type of property may not be enough to pay the existing taxes, so it is problematic to make them bear the National Construction Donation again. As for the list of those who should pay the National Construction Donation submitted by the public opinion organs, it is also not easy to implement. Because it is difficult to determine whether a person is wealthy, except in a few special cases.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Clarifications</h3>
<p>(1) Rental Disputes</p>
<p>(1) Long Xingde asks: Before the war, I rented a small attic room from landlord Lu. In January of the 32nd year of the Republic, Lu suddenly transferred the entire house to a Mr. Liu. After this new landlord moved in, he immediately wanted to take back the room for his own use, citing reasons such as too many people coming and going and gatherings for mahjong games. He insisted that I move out, promising to pay removal expenses or help find a new house. However, he refused to accept rent from January of that year. Because I don't understand the law, I did not deposit the rent with the court. Now I hear that Mr. Liu intends to sue in court. In the above circumstances, please advise: (1) Are his stated reasons sufficient? (2) Can I demand continued tenancy rights? (3) Is it legal to not recognize his status as a sub-landlord? (4) How should the unpaid rent issue be resolved?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) Both points raised by Mr. Liu are claims that comply with legal regulations, with the second point being particularly strong. (2) If the judgment results in the house being taken back, continued tenancy is not possible. Otherwise, the tenancy relationship continues to exist. (3) If you don't recognize the sub-landlord's status, what is the status of the third tenant? (4) If the reason for non-payment of rent is due to refusal of acceptance, there should be definite proof.</p>
<p>(2) Foster Daughter-in-Law Refuses Marriage</p>
<p>Li Rongzhang asks: My friend, Ms. So-and-so, is currently 19 years old. At the age of 14, according to her parents' arrangement, she was betrothed to a Mr. Zhang as a foster daughter-in-law. At that time, Mr. Zhang's family paid a bride price of 200 yuan in counterfeit currency. Now Ms. So-and-so is dissatisfied with this marriage contract and ran away a few days ago, seeking refuge at a friend's house. Please advise: (1) Does the system of foster daughter-in-law exist in current law? (2) Are Ms. So-and-so's parents legally responsible for her running away? (3) Can the Zhang family force Ms. So-and-so to return home and marry? Is there a legal basis for this? (4) If Ms. So-and-so leaves the Zhang family on her own, are there any legal consequences? What is the proper course of action? (5) Should the 200 yuan in counterfeit currency received in the past be refunded now? How should it be calculated?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) There is no provision for foster daughter-in-law in the law. (2) Running away on one's own has nothing to do with the parents. (3) Marriage cannot be forced. (4) If it is to prevent infringement, it is not illegal. However, if there are other circumstances, it is another matter. However, at 19 years old, she is still a minor, and the proper course of action is to return to parental custody. (5) The bride price received by the parents should be repaid by the parents.</p>

<p>To Chen Jijun: We have read your letter and deeply sympathize with you. At a time when there are more people than jobs, introducing employment is indeed not easy. You can go to the Shanghai Employment Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs at No. 856 North Sichuan Road and the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute of the Chinese Vocational Education Society at No. 80 Beilong Road to register. There may be suitable opportunities. If you show us your resume, our column will publish a brief message to help you find a job.</p>
<p>To Wang Qinghua: We have received your letter. Regarding the identification of a biological child, we usually use the genetic principles of blood type (divided into four types OABAl) to infer it, but there are many restrictions, and sometimes we cannot protect a certain result. At present, the identification of a biological child should be applied to the court, and then transferred to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for identification. Ordinary hospitals cannot accept this identification, because this is purely a judicial issue. For the sake of your family's happiness and your couple's love, there is no need to go this way. How can you believe the rumors outside?</p>

<p>Zhang Yi's Speech</p>

He stated that the university had been established for 42 years and has always taken service, cooperation, and sacrifice as its motto, contributing to society. During the war of resistance against Japan, it moved to Chongqing, leaving only a preparatory department in Shanghai, which was steadfastly supported by former President Li. In 1942, the government changed it to a national university to encourage well-run private universities and schools. Last year, the university's repatriation was completed the fastest, and it also opened the earliest. Alumni associations from various places made great efforts.

The relationship between China and the United States has always been close. General education in the United States is under the Education Committee, and university education is based on the Board of Trustees, which can be used as a reference for China. The Chinese government is unable to establish many universities and should encourage private schooling.</p>

<p>(2) Recently, free capital from North China has gathered in Shanghai, and general prices have been soaring, and yarn and cloth are no exception. The committee believes that in accordance with the new plan of emergency economic measures, hoarding and speculation in yarn and cloth should be banned. Therefore, in terms of yarn and cloth regulation policies, a plan to ban hoarding and speculation is being planned. It will be implemented as soon as it is submitted to and approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>[Another News] After the candidates for the four group committees of the committee were selected, it has been decided that they will hold separate meetings at 10:00 AM today to discuss methods for promoting the work of each group. It is said that the letter from the Yarn Merchants Association requesting the cancellation of controls yesterday will be submitted to the Finished Product Sales and Transportation Group Committee for discussion. After a plan is made, it will be submitted to the entire committee for discussion. In addition, after the group committees meet in the morning, if Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs can arrive in Shanghai today, an emergency committee will be convened tonight at 8:00 PM. Otherwise, a discussion meeting will be held to quickly decide on a method to ban the sharp increase in yarn and cloth prices.</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Request Cancellation of Controls</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Jiasheng, Shen Boqin, Xi Shaosun, and other executive directors of the Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association, yesterday brought the association's submission and visited Zou Bingwen, chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee. Zou was busy with official business, so Yuan Zhongda, director of the secretariat of the committee, received them on his behalf. Yuan promised to forward the submission, and Zhou and others then took their leave. It is said that the content of the submission includes four points: (1) Cancel all control measures and restore free sales. (2) Cancel the price limit negotiation system and restore free trading. (3) The cotton yarn sold by China Textile Construction Corporation should be sold at market prices. (4) The Yarn Merchants Association hopes to send representatives to attend future discussions of cases related to yarn and cloth sales by the Textile Adjustment Committee to provide advice and contribute opinions.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market, at the beginning of the market, non-industry people's intentions were still strong. The dyeing and weaving factories in this street and the Changjiang gang's demand was not deserted, and the market continued to rise. 42 count blue phoenix yarn soared to between 20 million yuan. Near the close, it was heard that stock prices had fallen back, and those with multiple floating profits sold off, and the price immediately fell back slightly, resulting in 19.5 million yuan, which was still 900,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The remaining 32 count, 20 count, 16 count, and other coarse and fine yarns also uniformly pulled up 300,000 to 400,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Trade is Busy</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, the Textile Construction Corporation opened cloth as usual. 12-pound colored ball yanghe fine cloth was still 356,000 yuan (limited to factory applications) and Jinlian Miaowu yuan billie price was 400,000 yuan. The market was quite lively, and the leading fine cloth was very expensive at the close, reaching 440,000 yuan, an increase of 6,500 yuan from the previous day. The remaining five-fortune colored balls yanghe and other grades of fine cloth also rose 7,000 to 8,000 to 10,000 yuan. Shilin cloth, blue cloth, bleached cloth, yuan cloth, twill zhigong, etc., all continued to rise by 10,000 to 230,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Stable - Transactions Slightly Lower Than Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market, in the morning, because yarn prices rose rapidly and the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegraphic transfer shrunk again, people's hearts were extremely high, and asking prices were chaotic. Buyers, because the market price has been tending to a high point for several days, their appetite was slightly lax, and there were very few transactions. In the afternoon, because the closing price of cotton yarn was slightly weak and the black market exchange rate was heard to have fallen back slightly, people's hearts were relaxed. Sellers no longer raised prices, yarn factories had a slight appetite, and there were mutual entries and exits among peers. However, the market price was still difficult to fall back, and the footing trend was stable. The market situation was the same as the previous day, and prices seemed to be slightly better. The number of transactions was slightly lower than the previous day. The delivery price to factories for each grade was estimated at 2.15 million to 2.2 million yuan for Lingbao, 1.79 million yuan for Hanxi, and the price was estimated at 1.75 million to 1.82 million yuan for Hanxi, 1.77 million yuan for Chongsha, 1.46 million to 1.48 million yuan for Fire Machine, and 1.48 million yuan for South Taicang.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Trends are Chaotic</h3>
<p>Peruvian Sugar Stops Warehouse Receipt Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trends were chaotic, and it still did not break away from the firm trend. Because there was a "piqiu" (speculative) transaction, the market stopped warehouse receipt entry and exit to avoid fueling the rising trend. Spot goods were about 660,000 to 670,000 yuan, 24 coarse white warehouse receipts were 625,000 yuan, spot goods were 660,000 to 670,000 yuan, and 20 medium sugar white was 575,000 yuan to 567,000 yuan. Four and a half car white was 620,000 yuan to 657,000 yuan. Three and a half car white was 600,000 yuan, Hechi was 490,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan to 510,000 yuan. Local sugar Xinghua was 540,000 yuan at the highest, and 520,000 to 530,000 yuan at the lowest. Xingchi was 420,000 to 430,000 yuan, accounting for 4500 bundles. Shantou green was 380,000 to 390,000 yuan, accounting for dozens of packages. Diaozhou green white was 340,000 to 350,000 yuan per package, and ordinary was 330,000 yuan, accounting for one to two hundred packages. Hainan white was 500,000 yuan for 40 packages.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise - Consolidated Bonds Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds were slightly stable, and transactions were still small, only about 1 million. Unified Bing opened at 7900 yuan in the morning, 503 room 604 room rose to 8400 yuan, 360 room 230 room 555 room were sold and then flattened slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing, A, B, and Ding each rose 200 yuan, Unified Bing rose 400 yuan, and Unified Wu was flat alone.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks were severely reduced to about 9 and a half yuan due to the tragic shrinking of Hong Kong-Shanghai electricity. Banks helped with money exchange, and the Westerners who gathered in the Public Concession alone bought a lot of Yisha. Guangbang and securities both had supply. Yisha opened in the morning at a high price of 84,000 yuan, reaching the 100,000 yuan mark, and then slightly returned, hovering at 93,000 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha, Huizhong, Yeyinglian each rose by about 10%, Julong, Telephone, Aviation each rose by half a percent, Yeguang rose by 20%, and Paper Yizhou each rose by 20% and zero.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market's Transactions are Still Good Yesterday, in the foreign firm tea market, due to the Wu Chang Tea Company importing "Needle Eyebrow" green tea, the transactions were quite good. Other grades like the 35th year "Precious Eyebrow" tea were also being absorbed by the Yongxing and Tongfu foreign firms, thus opening the market. Because the buyers' prices were not loose, the sellers lacked the power to raise prices, so the situation continued to show a state of hesitation. As for the domestic sales tea, the buyers still followed each other continuously, with flower tea and "Flag Grab" being particularly popular. According to industry insiders, the demand for Qimen black tea has recently been relatively sluggish, but those who hold it still plan to stand firm, and the situation can still be supported.</h3>
<p>Coal Ash Soars</p>
<p>The coal market continues to see more buyers, and the upward trend continues unabated. In particular, the inventory of high-quality coal ash on the market is very low, so once purchased, the market price rises rapidly. The price of Kaiping No. 1 ash has reached as high as 1.3 million yuan. The price increases for medium-quality coal ash such as Chenxi ash and Pole ash are slower due to the arrival of goods. Although the arrival of white coal blocks and coke is still large, the buying interest is strong due to the cost relationship, and the demand has increased sharply. The transaction price of old screened blocks has risen to 1.65 million yuan, and Pingxiang coke is 1.2 million yuan. The sales of old pit "Xiaozi" were the most sluggish before due to the impact of the American "Na Xiaozi" dispatching goods, but yesterday there were also transactions at around 1.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>Wood Prices Surge</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wood market saw further chaos. Due to the sharp rise in the prices of all goods on the market, the market price of foreign pine rose, and the market price of fir also increased.</p>
<p>The Market is Silent and the Transaction of Human Silk is Not High</p>
<p>The Factory Price is About One Million Higher than Yesterday</p>
<p>Because it was rumored that a lot of artificial silk had arrived in Hong Kong, people's hearts were inevitably soft, so the market was firm at the beginning yesterday, but eventually became tired and fell. The opening price of 120-count "Golden Three Horses" in the morning was 26 million yuan, but it was abandoned because there were few people to ask about it. Ten packages were traded for 5.5 million yuan. The market was even more silent in the afternoon, and those who wanted to sell had to lower the price, which gradually declined, and the final price was sold for 5 million yuan, which was 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day. 75-count "Chicken Gold" semi-gloss still called 34 million yuan, but scattered packages did not reach this price.</p>
<p>The transaction in the factory market was still rare yesterday. Because the price has risen too much in recent days, there are occasional onlookers, and the buyers are preparing to open the customs silver, so most of them cannot be traded. The asking prices of all levels have increased by 1 million to 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. The asking price for CD grades reached 32 million yuan, and there were some transactions in retail. The price for medium grades was 30 million yuan, and the price for high grades was 31.5 million yuan. There were orders for 25-fen dry warp, with an asking price of around 24 million yuan, and the selling price for retail upper body goods was 21.1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Because of the high price of raw materials, silk goods in the silk market rose in unison yesterday. The asking price for Maya quilt surface was 12.6 million yuan, and the opening price for Huaqiang quilt surface was 12.2 million yuan. A transaction of 2 million yuan was made. Dacheng checkered cloth The maximum price was 34,670 yuan, and then it fell slightly, closing at 3,300 yuan, with an additional 200 yuan per day. Due to the increasing cost, the market price of Sheng goods also rose by 230,000 yuan yesterday. The asking price for Luo spinning rose by 500 yuan yesterday, and the price of Huajin crepe remained the same as the previous day due to the softening of raw materials.</p>
<p>Mexico Declares Stop to the Sale of Gold Coins</p>
<p>[United Press Mexico City, 25th] The Mexican representative of the International Monetary Fund announced yesterday at the request of the group that the country has stopped selling gold coins in order to stop gold and currency speculation. At the same time, the Mexican Bank continues to ship gold to the governments of Portugal and Argentina. Last year, the Mexican Bank sold gold coins and obtained huge profits, preventing speculators from smuggling gold out of the country. The bank sold 50-peso gold coins at US$47.57, which is equivalent to US$39.53 per ounce, while the US market price is US$35 per ounce.</p>
<p>[United Press Manila, 25th] The International Monetary Fund notified 43 member states yesterday that the price of gold should not exceed US$35 per ounce. The Philippines is one of the member states, and the fund's notification has a considerable impact on the Philippine gold mining industry. President Roxas has not yet formally announced the policy, but gold mining companies have used special licenses to ship gold bars to London for sale in the international market. Philippine Finance Minister Cuatero believes that newly mined Philippine gold can be sold outside the production area, but the price has not been set.</p>

<p>New Doctors and New Drugs Pay Attention to Summer Hygiene Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>Spring has quietly slipped away, and the scorching sun shines on the world again. The burning sunlight heralds the arrival of the scorching heat. The sudden change in climate enhances the opportunity for bacteria to flourish, and terrible diseases will strike again.</p>
<p>Shanghai may launch an annual summer hygiene campaign. Inspecting the production of cold foods, banning the sale of plum juice, cold noodles, etc., and advising citizens to get vaccinated. Today, the digestive diseases that are prevalent in summer have not yet been discovered. It is fortunate for the citizens if they can plan to prevent them!</p>
<p>Millions of people have died in the past year, not because of war, nor because of floods and famines, but because of ignorance and negligence. Without hygiene knowledge, without paying attention to hygiene, diseases are rampant, and excess deaths occur. A tragic page of history has been read, but perhaps, the most tragic lesson has yet to be learned. That is the time when death is rampant and corpses are like mountains. Please see, the city is surrounded by garbage, accumulating a lot of feces, and the rivers and ponds are completely stinking. People urinate and defecate everywhere in the streets and alleys, as if it is a common occurrence. I don't know that these are dangerous objects, and they are breeding grounds and distribution centers for pathogens. The climate has also brought flies and mosquitoes. Who says that the threat of disease and death is not approaching day by day.</p>
<p>The inability to collect waste in time is the most unfortunate thing. We travel around the streets and see garbage like mountains and stench. Ordinary people dump garbage from their homes outdoors and pour sewage into ditches, as if they have fulfilled their responsibility of cleaning. There is no garbage can setting, and the original garbage that has been piled up is dug out by children who pick up old things, and they spread what they don't want on the sidewalk. The cleaners who are responsible for cleaning the streets do not have a scheduled time for processing garbage, and they raise dust at any time. This fully shows that the Health Bureau has not provided health training, and has not noticed that this is also a measure that endangers the health of citizens. The garbage collected is piled up in the city's squares without proper disposal, which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>The living environment of ordinary poor citizens is originally bad, and they are also close to rivers and ponds, and they dump garbage and sewage at will. Sometimes they also go to wash clothes, wash vegetables, and even wash rice. They do not think that they will pollute the water and affect public health when they brush the toilet. When using this water, they do not think that this will cause themselves to be attacked by germs, and the result is often unfortunate. Not all people in Shanghai have the opportunity to use tap water. The emergency project of tap water in West Shanghai is a clear indication that safe drinking water is still a serious problem in Shanghai. Unfortunately, people who drink tap water do not see the severity of the drinking water problem, and people who drink unclean water do not think about improving it, and the crisis is deepening.</p>
<p>Small food vendors are everywhere, and obstructing traffic is a small matter, and endangering health is a big matter. Especially in summer, this is even more dangerous. Although cooked hot food is less dangerous, it is also unreliable if it is exposed for a long time before eating and contaminated by coughs and sneezes. As for the spiced beef, Nanjing pressed duck, Zhenjiang肴肉, and Wuhu dried tofu and other foods placed on the side of the road, that is even more dangerous. Fruits and raw vegetables are always rinsed with unclean cold water over and over again to make them moist and keep them fresh, which are all dangerous. Plum juice, shaved ice, and jelly are naturally unnecessary to say.</p>
<p>"Beware of illness entering through the mouth" can be used as a warning for summer life. Several common infectious diseases in summer, such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery, are all transmitted through the mouth. Therefore, the theme of summer hygiene is to be careful about "drinking" and "eating". But this small matter can be said to be impossible to do in any place in the current Chinese society, which is regrettable!</p>
<p>Hygiene is a means of protecting human health and enabling the full development of human physical and mental health. Therefore, whether it is personal life, family life, or group life, it must be based on hygienic conditions as a principle. From this inference, it can be known that hygiene is actually a matter that anyone must pay attention to at any time and at any place, and it is not limited to a specific time or place. However, due to the different seasons and the different climates, different environments are formed. In a particular season, certain diseases are often easily discovered or prevalent. In temperate countries, the most common epidemic in summer is digestive infectious diseases, and respiratory infectious diseases are more likely to be prevalent in winter. Therefore, we have many hygiene problems that should be paid special attention to in different seasons.</p>
<p>Since summer is the season when digestive infectious diseases are prone to be prevalent, summer hygiene campaigns can also be said to be digestive infectious disease prevention campaigns. In summer hygiene, naturally, how to avoid the transmission of digestive infectious diseases is the center. There are three main types of digestive infectious diseases, namely typhoid fever, dysentery, and cholera. The prevention of these three diseases is not too difficult. In European and American countries with developed public health, it is impossible for medical students to get a case for practice. It can be known that there are really ways to prevent and control it, but it depends on whether it is done or not.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to the development of summer hygiene: one is public health and the other is personal hygiene. Thorough public health can achieve excellent preventive effects. For example, the supply of drinking water is safe and clean, and all citizens may be able to enjoy it. Feces and pollutants are properly treated, and there are no flies. The control of substandard food is effective, and the source of pathogens is blocked. In this way, it is naturally not easy to find gastrointestinal patients. Even if it is found, there is a reasonable disposal, isolation, disinfection, and treatment are effective, and naturally it will not spread widely. However, public health is still in a dormant state, and it is not possible to reach the ideal standard in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Now, I hope that we can pay close attention to personal hygiene. The primary condition is to automatically not harm public health. For example, no longer dumping garbage and sewage indiscriminately, or urinating and defecating everywhere. Secondly, I hope you pay attention to a few points;</p>
<p>(1) Get cholera vaccination or typhoid cholera mixed vaccination as soon as possible, (2) Do not drink unboiled water, (3) Do not eat food sold by street vendors, (3) Do not eat retail fruits, (5) Do not eat raw vegetables, (6) Do not eat food manufactured by shops with poor hygiene facilities, (7) Do not eat fermented or spoiled food, (8) Do not wash vegetables, wash dishes, or wash rice in ponds or rivers, (9) Eat fresh fruits and remove the skin, (10) Food made should be avoided. Mosquitoes pollute, and do not eat any food that mosquitoes can pass through.</p>
<p>Naturally, efforts in public health cannot be slackened either. I hope that the health authorities will do their best to find ways to make public health facilities in the city reasonable as soon as possible. In addition to the efforts to improve personal hygiene, there will definitely be good results in the future. The people who died in the past due to illness are the price of obtaining lessons today. We cannot forget this painful and tragic lesson!</p>
<p>At present, it is the time for the Shanghai government and citizens to jointly take effective actions to prevent the epidemic of summer infectious diseases. The era of holding meetings, making resolutions, shouting slogans, and issuing slogans has passed. We must strive for future success with action, replace empty words with action, and pay close attention to</p>
<p>Shanghai, which is in chaos, Shanghai, which is dirty, and Shanghai, which is prone to plague, will inevitably cause more deaths and injuries when diseases enter the city. The metropolis of more than 5 million people in Shanghai must not allow diseases to run rampant.</p>
<p>Eradicating Infectious Diseases is the Current Urgent Task of Doctors Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Since medicine has embarked on the track of science, or it can be said that it has become a department of science, its function has also been expanded invisibly: from the therapeutic effect of individuals, it has gradually tended to the preventive aspect of groups or society.</p>
<p>China has always had the saying of "the best doctor treats the disease before it occurs."</p>
<p>The meaning of this sentence "the best doctor treats the disease before it occurs" is very similar to today's scientific medical "prevention": However, the word "prevention" in current scientific medicine is more inclined to infectious diseases. The reason is that everyone has already understood the origin and whereabouts of this infectious disease, and also knows its fierce danger; but it must be in an unhygienic environment to be able to show its strength and prestige, and to be able to transmit each other to form an epidemic, so it can be prevented and stopped by human power. In other words: if the living environment is in line with hygienic rules, and the prevention work is very thorough and strict, then it is very possible to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases and stop the activity of infectious diseases. Therefore, we can know the importance of "prevention" in modern medicine, especially the importance of it for infectious diseases.</p>
<p>In the past, the only task of doctors was to treat diseases; today's doctors have followed the advancement of the tide and the needs of the times. In addition to treating diseases, they also have a major responsibility, which is to prevent diseases, which is also the so-called prevention work. What is the main target of prevention work? Needless to say, it is this infectious disease that can be transmitted to each other to form an epidemic. Therefore, preventing infectious diseases is the central work of prevention; at the same time, it can also be said to be the central task of today's doctors.</p>
<p>Ordinary diseases, only the patient's own individual or a small number of people suffer, and cannot affect others because of their own pain and suffering; infectious diseases are different: they can transmit the disease they suffer to others, from their own pain to other people. The number of people affected can be transmitted from one person to tens of thousands of people; therefore, the speed of onset and the severity of the damage are not comparable to ordinary diseases.</p>
<p>It is said that the average life expectancy of Chinese people is only 30 years old; there are many reasons, of course, but the growth of infection, I think must be the main reason.</p>
<p>Originally, you could be disease-free, but because of poor "prevention" and lack of attention to hygiene, you got sick; originally, you could not die after getting sick, but because the handling was improper, you ended up dying without rescue. This is a fact that can be seen everywhere in China, and it is the only reason that causes the decline in the average life expectancy and the increase in the mortality rate of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>For example, typhoid fever, an infectious disease, is rare in European and American countries. If one or two infectious patients are found in the hospital, it is very rare. It is not easy for Chinese people who study medicine in Europe and the United States to see typhoid fever in clinical practice; it is not certain that they will see a real typhoid patient after studying medicine for three to five years. In China, however, it can be seen everywhere; in the statistics of patients in hospitals, especially in the field of internal medicine, typhoid patients account for a large number. Other infectious diseases, such as dysentery, cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, meningitis, etc., are of course the same example. As for the increase in the mortality rate after getting sick, it is also expected. Because on the one hand, Chinese science is immature and not popular, and on the other hand, old doctors do not understand infectious diseases, and the treatment cannot be reasonable.</p>
<p>How to stop the occurrence of infectious diseases and eradicate the spread of infection, the responsibility undoubtedly falls on the shoulders of each of our doctors.</p>
<p>A Brief Discussion on Typhoid Fever Zhu Jinsheng</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Illness enters through the mouth." Typhoid fever is a good example of "illness entering through the mouth" among infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Typhoid fever is a type of acute systemic infectious disease. The cause of the disease is a rod-shaped bacterium with flagella, which is very active, and is called typhoid bacteria.</p>
<p>The source of infection is mostly from water, milk, food, or contact with patients contaminated with typhoid bacteria. After the typhoid bacteria enter the mouth, they first reach the stomach. Countless bacteria are destroyed by stomach acid. However, there are also bacteria that have not been destroyed by stomach acid, escape the stomach barrier, and enter the duodenum and small intestine, reaching the lymph nodes not far from the end of the small intestine, and grow and reproduce. Some of the typhoid bacteria pass through the lymphatic glands through the lymphatic vessels and enter the blood, bringing them to the whole body. At this time, it is most reliable to take blood for bacterial culture. After the bacteria enter the blood, the patient's body temperature gradually increases, rose-colored rashes appear on the chest and abdomen, coughs, sometimes nosebleeds, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea or constipation, etc. After two weeks, the blood bacterial culture usually has no bacteria; however, the Widal's Test becomes positive, which is because immune bodies have been produced in the patient's blood after two weeks. Therefore, to diagnose typhoid fever in the first and second weeks, bacterial culture of blood is the most reliable, and after the second week, Widal's reaction is more accurate. Although immune bodies have been produced in the blood at this time, it does not mean that the patient has recovered; on the contrary, the patient's condition continues to develop and there is no sign of decline.</p>
<p>This is because the intestinal mucosa at the end of the small intestine two to four feet away has ulcerative changes. At this time, the patient's danger is the greatest, because intestinal mucosal ulceration can have two complications that can occur. The first type is the so-called intestinal bleeding; this is because blood vessels rupture in the intestinal ulceration area, causing unstoppable bleeding, resulting in blood in the stool. It usually occurs in the third stage of typhoid fever. Its danger depends on the amount of bleeding. The usual treatment method is to use blood transfusion to catch the loss of blood from the patient. However, sometimes blood transfusion is ineffective due to excessive bleeding. A small amount of intestinal bleeding can often stop automatically. The second type is also the most dangerous complication, which is intestinal perforation or intestinal rupture; this is the result of intestinal mucosal ulceration. This causes the intestinal wall to rupture, and the contents of the intestine flow from the rupture into the abdominal cavity, resulting in peritonitis. At this time, most of them are hopeless except for early detection and implementation of surgical operations to sew up the intestinal rupture. However, it is usually not that the discovery is too late and it is impossible to perform surgery, or the patient's resistance is too weak to withstand surgery. Therefore, the mortality rate of this complication is the highest. This disease also occurs in the third stage of typhoid fever.</p>
<p>The above two complications are not determined by the severity of the first two weeks of the patient. In other words: in the first two weeks, the patient's chills and fever may not be too high, and the symptoms may not be too serious, but in the third week, it suddenly becomes serious, and changes in intestinal perforation occur. Therefore, people with typhoid fever must not think that the condition is not very serious in the first two weeks, and ignore the sudden changes in the third week; on the contrary, people with typhoid fever should not despair, thinking that their condition is very serious in the first two weeks, and predicting that there must be complications of intestinal perforation or intestinal bleeding in the third week. People with typhoid fever must wait patiently for the past of the third week. If there are no above-mentioned two complications after the fourth week, it is probably that the difficult time has passed, the condition will gradually decrease, and the cold and heat will gradually decrease until the normal body temperature is reached. In terms of treatment: the general concept is that if you have typhoid fever, food is absolutely not suitable for entering the mouth. The reason is that diet often aggravates the disease (this is the general view of ordinary people). But if we think about it carefully, the patient's chills and fever are very high every day, and the metabolism in the body is accelerated and the decomposition effect is doubled; assuming that the daily energy consumption of ordinary people is 2,000 calories, then the consumption of typhoid patients must be 4,000 calories. If you do not take food, how can you balance the consumption of a large amount of heat energy? Therefore, I think that nutritious liquid food must be supplied to the patient as much as possible. Nutritious liquid food, such as milk, chicken juice, beef juice, fresh orange juice, etc., can be supplied to the patient as much as possible. Because these liquids are all residue-free foods, most of them are quickly absorbed after entering the intestine, and will never affect the typhoid ulceration at the end of the small intestine; on the contrary, the patient's condition can often recover faster due to sufficient nutrition. Even complications such as intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation seem to be less likely to occur. Of course, what I need to state is that when the patient has symptoms such as intestinal perforation and intestinal bleeding, then food should absolutely not be taken. We know that there is no specific medicine for typhoid fever; the new medicines currently invented, such as penicillin and streptomycin, do not have a definite effect. Therefore, nursing and dietary treatment are the most important. Finally, if the patient is well, we need to pay attention to the fact that typhoid bacteria often exist in the patient's stool. Forced-type patients are often "bacteria carriers" of typhoid fever. We must isolate bacteria carriers unless the stool examination proves that there are no typhoid bacteria. This also needs to be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Confusion and Pity Zhao Ji</p>
<p>The Chinese have never paid much attention to numbers. Even the number of the national population, from the beginning of the Republic of China to the present, has not yet been accurately counted, which is really pitiful to say. But there are also many confused things. The number of "doctors" who are responsible for public health can also be said casually, which is ridiculous. And what was said at the Seventh Congress of the Chinese Medical Association is even more "confused and pitiful"! The Chinese population is 400 million (inaccurate remainders, let alone mention them). I think the health authorities should probably know; then the number of doctors in the country (excluding traditional Chinese medicine) has been registered by the Ministry of Health, and naturally there are also numbers that can be counted (it is said to be more than 13,000 people). Why is it said that according to the national population ratio, there is already one doctor (referring to officially registered Western doctors) for every 10,000 people, which is too far off. I don't know if the population of our country has suddenly decreased due to years of internal and external turmoil? Or has the number of Western doctors suddenly increased several times like "Taishang Laojun transforming three Purities with one breath"? He also said: There is one doctor for every 7,000 people in European and American countries, and later corrected it and said: There is one doctor for every 70 people (the above were all heard by the author, but the speech of someone published in "Shanghai Medical News" has been modified this number without authorization). As far as I know, this number is also incorrect. However, for a large country with a population of over 400 million, there are only more than 13,000 official doctors, which is really "pitifully" poor! A few days later, I saw a piece of news in the "Medical News" column at the back of the 16th issue of the "Red Cross Monthly" published on April 30 of this year:</p>
<p>"The medical expert Ai Luosuo of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, after examining China for a year and a half, returned to San Francisco, USA, and said: About three-quarters of the deaths in China can be saved with very little cost; the remedies are nothing more than promoting hygiene, improving nutrition, and increasing the number of doctors. Ai believes that the medical situation in China is extremely terrible; on average, there is only one doctor for every 80,000 people, while in the United States, there is one doctor for every 1,500 people; the difference between the two countries is really too far." Such a statement is even more different when compared with the words in this Congress of the Chinese Medical Association; who is right and who is wrong? It is really like a "two-zhang monk", making people feel even more clueless! But according to what I think, Ai's statement about the ratio of the US population to the number of doctors is probably more correct. However, he still said that there is only one doctor for every 80,000 people in China after examining China for a year and a half, which also shows his negligence and confusion. In fact, this ratio is a number from more than ten years ago (before the war, there were only about 7,000 official Western doctors in the country, which is correct). I am afraid that someone was extremely confused during Ai's inspection in China and mistakenly provided him with the physician registration statistics figures before the war, which harmed Ai and made this joke. Is this the case? I have no way to predict it! In fact, the current number of doctors and the total population average out to be less than 40,000 people, but there is one official doctor (Western medicine); although this is an approximate number, it is not very different. Just imagine that the number of doctors in our country is so small, it is not only "pitiful", but as Ai said, "extremely terrible"! Although there are many methods and ways to "increase the number of doctors", why not one of the methods is to find ways to identify unlicensed doctors, relax the standards, and give them the opportunity to register legally. I hope that our highest authorities for examination and hygiene should plan for this as soon as possible and strive for remedies; take the suffering of the public and the life of the nation as the most important thing, and don't continue to be "confused" any longer!</p>
<p>According to the national population ratio, there is one doctor for every 40,000 people</p>
<p>The Physiological Hygiene of the Five Senses (Part 1) Bai Ding</p>
<p>The five senses are the five organs on the surface of the human body: ears, eyes, nose, tongue and skin. These five organs all have the function of sensing various stimuli from the outside world, so they are also collectively called sensory organs.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about these five sensory organs one by one in the order listed above: first, say a few words about the physiological concepts of each sensory organ, and then talk about their respective maintenance and hygiene.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the ear: the ear is the organ of hearing in the human body; all sounds from the outside world are managed by it. How does it manage it? It's a long story. In short: when the sound-producing body vibrates, it first makes the air vibrate, producing a kind of sound wave, and a part of this sound wave in the air is transmitted to the ear, moving the ends of the auditory nerve, causing them to be excited, and the end nerves then report this excitation of the sound wave to the brain, and then the sensation of sound is produced. This is a simple principle of "hearing". Next, let's talk about the eyes: the eyes are the eyes of the human body that are responsible for seeing things. How does it see things? Because the light from the outside world is reflected from the substance and reflected into the eyes, at this time, the ends of the optic nerves distributed in the eyes are stimulated and immediately report to the brain, so that a sensation of seeing things is produced. This sensation of seeing things is called "vision". Then let's talk about the nose and tongue: the nose is the organ for smelling, and the tongue? It is a tool for tasting, which everyone will know. So, how does the nose smell things? And how does the tongue taste? It has to be said. All substances have their own inherent odor. What is an odor? It is the tiny molecules of the substance, mixed in the air, touching the olfactory nerves distributed in the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, and causing a kind of stimulating odor, and the olfactory nerves immediately notify the brain without simplification, so that a so-called "sense of smell" is produced. The tongue that is responsible for taste is the same principle: when the substance arrives in the mouth and waits to be dissolved and touches the taste nerves on the surface of the tongue, it produces the sensation of "taste". Finally, let's talk about the skin as "touch": for example, I am now holding a pen and shaking it on paper to write, and I clearly feel that my fingers are holding a pen for writing; if I put the pen down and place it on the quilt, my fingers will immediately lose the feeling of contact between the pen and the fingers. At the same time, during the time of touching things, you will be able to perceive the pressure, warmth and coldness, and the position of this thing, and this feeling of the skin reporting external stimuli is called "touch".</p>
<p>The above has briefly explained the physiological concepts, or definitions, of the five senses, which are called sensory organs; below, let's talk about their hygiene.</p>
<p>(1) Hygiene of the ears: As mentioned above, the ear is the auditory organ responsible for hearing, so the so-called ear hygiene is the hygiene of the auditory organ. If we want to pay attention to the ear hygiene of this auditory organ, first of all, it goes without saying that we must try to protect the safety and soundness of the ear and not let it be harmed by external objects. What kind of protection method can make it safe and not cause harm? Such as one, when trimming 理, do not let it shave the ear hair, because the ear hair is actually a safety protector for protecting the ear, and many things that enter from the outside, especially small animals, can be blocked by the ear hair and cannot penetrate deeply. Otherwise, if foreign objects enter, of course, especially small animals that can move, such as insects, after invading, there will be no obstacles, and it will be like entering a doorless place, penetrating deeply into the ear and causing various ear diseases. Second, earwax is the secretion of the ear. It is harmful to take it too much and play with it, which will damage the eardrum; however, if it accumulates too much, it can also hinder hearing and easily cause tinnitus and other phenomena, so it should also be taken out. However, when taking it, be sure not to use hard metal equipment to avoid injury. Third, when swimming in summer, cotton and other things should be used to tightly plug the ears, because water flowing into the ears often causes ear inflammation and other diseases, which affects the safety of the ears. Fourth, our old-fashioned theaters have particularly strong music, which also greatly hinders the nerves inside the ears, that is, it affects the physiological function of the ears for hearing. Fifth, whenever there is a thunderstorm or the opening of large cannons and other sounds that are too high, it is advisable to open the mouth wide to balance the air pressure inside and outside the eardrum in the ears, so as to avoid the danger of being shattered. The above are all hygienic methods to protect the ears.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn: An Old-Fashioned Love Story by William Saroyan, translated by Lin Fengzao</p>
<p>My cousin Arak was a year and a half younger than me, with a round face, dark complexion, and a particularly good attitude. He wasn't forced at all. His attitude was natural from birth, and mine was bad from birth. When he ran into trouble at school, Arak was always able to dodge it. He smiled politely, revealing sparse front teeth, softening the iron heart of teacher Tefini. As for me, I always drilled into the core of the trouble, arguing and making noise, always saying that I was not wrong, and that Miss Tefini or someone else was wrong. And if necessary, I would take the case to the Supreme Court to prove my innocence.</p>
<p>I was often called to the office. Sometimes, I debated with Principal Dai Renjie in the office. Mr. Dai was not good at arguing, and in the end, I always got a beating. When I debated him to the point where he had nothing to say, he would take out the leather whip.</p>
<p>Arak was different from me; he didn't uphold justice. He was far less intelligent than me; but although he was a year and a half younger than me, he was in the same class as me. This was of course nothing, if our class wasn't the fifth grade. I always won my debates with the teachers, but they wouldn't let me go and wouldn't let me advance to the next grade. I think the only reason was that they hoped to refute me in the next semester so that they could be content. Therefore, I was the oldest student in the fifth grade.</p>
<p>One day, there was a poem written on the blackboard saying that Miss Tefini and Mr. Dai Renjie were in love, and also saying that Miss Tai was ugly. Miss Tai wanted to tell everyone that I wrote the poem. In fact, the author of the poem was not me, but my cousin Arak. When I write poems, I never write about Miss Tefini, but something more valuable. Miss Tai walked to my desk with a ruler in her hand, and without mentioning anyone's name, she said, "I'm going to find the person who wrote that terrible thing on the blackboard and punish him."</p>
<p>""He"!" I said. ""How do you know the author is a boy and not a girl!""</p>
<p>Miss Tai hit my right knuckle. I jumped up from my seat and said, ""You can't hit my knuckles for nothing, I'm going to report it.""</p>
<p>""Sit down,"" Miss Tai said.</p>
<p>I sat down. She pulled my right ear. This ear had been pulled back and forth by Miss Tai and other teachers and had changed its shape.</p>
<p>I sat there and said softly, so softly that it was almost inaudible: ""Just you wait.""</p>
<p>""Shut your tongue and don't talk again,"" Miss Tai said. Although I was in pain like a ghost, I really stuck out my tongue and shut it up. The boys and girls in the class from Mexico, Japan, Armenia, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and ordinary America laughed at me acting in a farce. Miss Tefini picked up the ruler and wanted to hit my hand, but the ruler brushed my nose. This was a special insult to me, because then, as now, my nose was big. If my nose was a little smaller, it wouldn't have brushed it. I believe Miss Tai's blow was a subtle lesson for my big nose.</p>
<p>I covered my nose with my bruised hand and stood up again.</p>
<p>""It was you who told me to shut my tongue,"" I said. I also said that I was only following her orders, and I didn't do anything wrong or break any rules. She shouldn't attack my hand or brush my nose.</p>
<p>""You have to obey the rules,"" Miss Tai said, ""I can't stand your nonsense anymore. You have to obey the rules.""</p>
<p>I took my hand off my nose and started to obey the rules. I smiled, as if I was a child giving her a red apple. My audience laughed for a while. Miss Tai dropped the ruler, stretched out her body to grab me, rolled off the table, immediately got up, and ran around the room chasing me.</p>
<p>""I'm making trouble again,"" I said to myself. Miss Tai was still running around the room chasing me. ""I'm making trouble again, and in the end, it will turn into a homicide. Cousin Arak is the culprit, and he's sitting there laughing. There's no justice anywhere.""</p>
<p>Later, Miss Tai caught me. I knew she would always catch</p>
<h3>Large Investors Remain Eager Buyers; Shanghai Stock Market Conditions Confused; Di Yong Yarn Once Broke the 10,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday on the Shanghai stock market, large investors maintained their appetite for buying, so despite the initial blow of the Securities Exchange requiring a 50% cash deposit on forward contracts, which caused weakness at the opening, the Yong Yarn still managed to reach new highs mid-session due to the stimulation of the soaring black market exchange rate. Yong Gong even reached the limit for price increases, and the same was true for Zhong Si. However, there was too much floating stock, and the off-market interest rate rose again to 45 cents, with arbitrage reaching 720 yuan in the market. Prices fell back quickly near the close. The overall trend is becoming increasingly confusing, and the future is likely to be uncertain.</p>
<p>Initially this morning, due to reports that the Securities Exchange had extended the deadline for forward deliveries by three months, but that a 50% cash deposit was still required, people were apprehensive and the market opened lower. After the opening, Forward Yong Yarn rose from 224, 22, 179, 129, and 197 to 9680 yuan. 235, 89, 158, and 61 sold, and 14 and 76 even sold spot Yong Yarn, once pushing the price down to within 9400 yuan. 154, 76, and 212 still had a healthy appetite for buying, and 97 also accepted spot Yong Yarn, raising the price to above 9600 yuan. 155, 76, 186, 83, and 24 sold off, and 32 and 94 sold spot Yong Yarn, again lowering forward deliveries to 9400 yuan. 228, 54, 36, and 171 rose to above 9600 yuan, while 185, 24, and 134 sold spot Yong Yarn, and 106 also closed out positions, causing another drop to 9480 yuan. The black market for gold banknotes soared. 157, 197, 61, 83, 36, 212, 122, 56, 12, and 224 were desperately trying to buy, and 97 bought back spot Yong Yarn. At the same time, there was talk of a progressive system for depositing security money from the 1.5 billion deposit account, and Forward Yong Yarn finally broke through the 10,000 yuan mark. Yong Gong was acquired by Nong Bang 162, etc., and forward deliveries hit the price increase limit. The same was true for Zhong Si. Forward Yong Yarn rose from 76, 36, 163, 61, and 32 to 10,100 yuan, a new high price of 9,500 yuan for spot. 140, 234, 94, 83, and 197 sold within 9,800 yuan, and 12, 123, and 36 continued to buy. 180 and 97 continued to buy spot Yong Yarn, again pushing towards the 10,000 yuan mark. The off-market interest rate opened high at 40.5 cents and 45 cents, and also reached a high price of 720 yuan in the market. 218, 224, 157, 160, 155, 183, 235, 89, 65, 117, and 217 sold in unison, and prices fell slightly back to 9,600 yuan. Although 157 and 32 advanced to above 9,700 yuan, the Hong Kong Shanghai Electric rose from 9.4 yuan to 9.8 yuan, and yarn prices fell sharply. 89, 94, 36, 155, 83, 223, and 112, etc., cut back on long positions, and forward deliveries fell to 9,400 yuan, a low price of 8,750 yuan for immediate delivery. 171, 196, and 61 advanced to 9,750 yuan, and 22, 47, and 31 were still selling, closing at 9,650 yuan. After the close, Forward Yong Yarn was bought by 224, and the price was called up to 9,800 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn, Jingfu, and Hui stocks fell, Yong Gong rose by a strong 50%, Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, Zhongfa, and Dongxing each fell by a strong 50%, Xinfei fell by about 10%, Zhongsi rose to the limit and then retreated, rising by 10% along with Cement, Tongyi, Huorong, and Lian each rose by a strong 50%, Xinya was flat, Jinglun Hui fell, Guohuo fell by a strong 50%, and the rest rose slightly. In terms of forward deliveries, Yong Gong rose to the limit, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing rose slightly, and Huafeng fell slightly. In terms of off-market older stocks, Nanyang, Zhabei, and Dasheng all fell, Wuzhou rose slightly, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>Arbitrage Trading</p>
<p>For spot and forward arbitrage trading, the interest rate ranged from 13 cents to over 30 cents, and finally around 26 cents. Yong Yarn ranged from 390 yuan to 720 yuan, and finally 650 yuan. 151, 83, 224, 117, 104, 94, 157, 171, 85, 152, 95, 212, and 232 all posted bids, and 177, 220, 56, 159, etc., posted [bids]. Xinguang ranged from 9.5 yuan to 13 yuan, and finally 11 yuan. Xinhe ranged from 165 yuan to 270 yuan, and Huafeng ranged from 6.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Most Banks in Nanchang Experience Losses in the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang correspondent reports on the 26th] The preliminary results of the bank settlements in this city are complete, and most banks have experienced losses. The Bank of China lost as much as 400 million, and the Bank of Communications and the Agricultural Bank also lost 100 to 200 million each. Few other commercial banks and finance shops made a profit. However, the Provincial Bank alone made a profit of over 1 billion in the past six months.</p>
<p>Another report: Prices in this city are rising again, especially for cotton cloth. Foreign yarn is also rising by more than one million per day, with 21-count Sanshan yarn at 10.4 million.</p>
<h3>Raw Peanuts and Tea Shipped to Europe</h3>
<p>[Report from our publication] The French postal ship "Andre Lebon" left Shanghai yesterday morning to return to France. It carried 5,000 boxes of tea, 2,240 packages of raw peanuts, 25 pieces of pork, 7 pieces of sausage casings, and over 900 packages of luggage and mail from Shanghai to France. In addition, 70 pieces of tobacco leaves were shipped to Bose.</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian States Determination to Prevent Further Rise in Rice Prices; 65,000 Shí of Rice Sold at Fair Prices in Each District Monthly</h3>
<p>In recent days, prices in this city have suddenly risen again, and the authorities are paying close attention to this. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, gave a speech yesterday on the recent food problem and the general price trends. He said: The recent rise in rice prices is extremely unreasonable, and I have been paying close attention to it. The main reason for the rise in rice prices is nothing more than the severe storms and heavy rains before the Dragon Boat Festival, which reduced the source of rice, creating an opportunity for unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the market. However, the city's rice reserves are extremely abundant, and the sources from various places are also very large, so there is no fear of shortage. In order to prevent rice prices from rising again, we have decided to strengthen the food regulation work. He also said that the work of the Food Regulation Committee is quite active, and at the meeting yesterday afternoon, it was decided to supply 65,000 shí of fair-priced rice to each district in the city every month.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Production Equipment in Shanghai's Cotton Textile Industry; Total of Over Two Million Spindles</h3>
<p>[Report from our publication] According to statistics from the Industry and Commerce Assistance Office: Shanghai's cotton textile industry has a total of 2,082,102 spindles. Among them, the Textile Construction Company accounts for 887,364 spindles, and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association accounts for 1,194,738 spindles. If operating day and night for 20 hours, and operating for 26 days per month, 105,144 pieces of 20-count yarn can be spun. However, the actual output is only 84,000 pieces due to insufficient power and machine repairs.</p>
<p>The total number of thread spindles in each factory in this city is 395,304 pieces. The Textile Construction Company accounts for 235,540 spindles, and the factories in the Sixth District Association account for 123,764 spindles. The maximum possible production is 19,760 pieces of 42-count yarn per month, but due to insufficient power and machine repairs, the actual output is 13,000 pieces.</p>
<p>According to statistics on looms in this city, the Textile Construction Company, the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association, and the Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association together own 64,298 looms. The maximum possible monthly output is 3,344,000 pieces of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth (calculated at 40 yards per piece), requiring 105,376 pieces of yarn. But the actual output is: 650,000 pieces from the Textile Construction Company, 474,500 pieces from private factories, and 888,966 pieces of local cloth from factories in the Fourth District Association; totaling a monthly cloth production of 2,013,466 pieces, requiring 63,424 pieces of yarn.</p>
<p>The supply and demand situation for yarn and thread in this city is as follows: Yarn – the maximum monthly supply is 105,144 pieces, the demand is 129,336 pieces, a shortage of 24,196 pieces; The maximum production of thread is 13,000 pieces, the demand is 18,000 pieces, a shortage of 5,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Increase Sharply; Japonica and Indica Both Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 6,100 shí of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market conditions were affected by price fluctuations outside the market, and prices increased accordingly. Japonica and indica rice both saw a rebound of over 10,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan also increased by 10,000 yuan. The market slightly stabilized around noon.</p>
<p>Due to frequent price increases in the interior, flour remained nominally stable but effectively firm. Miscellaneous brand flour and foreign flour rose by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales were normal, but the price still tended to soften, retreating slightly by 1,000 yuan. Bean cakes were inconsistently firm and weak. Factory bean cakes rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while Yingkou cakes were transacted lightly, weakening slightly by 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the China Trust Bureau's large-scale supply of soybeans, the sales market for each oil factory suddenly became sluggish, and prices fell sharply by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The oil market, however, saw the continued activity of the Guangdong gang, and raw soybean oil continued to rise by over 20,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil also followed suit, rising by 20,000 yuan, and clear oil also increased by over 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Tea beans from Nanyang continued to be processed, with prices rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red beans from Guangdong still had an appetite for buying, and prices continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. Corn was being processed by alcohol factories, and there were inquiries from the north, with prices soaring by over 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was fixed at a high price but transactions were sluggish. Sesame prices rose steadily, with demand exceeding supply. Foreign merchants were active, and prices continued to rise by 11,000 yuan, remaining firm despite the high price. Raw peanuts from South China continued to be absorbed strongly, with prices rising wildly and endlessly, and another surge of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan was seen. However, the sales of broad beans to other ports came to a standstill, and local sales were limited, resulting in a continuous drop of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat was expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Flour Industry Association Departed for Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our publication] Rong Jingren, Bian Jizhou, Xi Debing, and others, directors of the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, departed for Beijing together yesterday. It is said that this trip is to negotiate a wheat loan with the central authorities and urge an early release of funds.</p>
<h3>Silk Export Issues for the Year; Guidance Association Decides to Form a Design Committee to Study the Matter</h3>
<p>Regarding the silk export issues for this year, the Silk Guidance Association has decided to form a separate design committee to study the matter. The committee is waiting for relevant parties to nominate representatives and hire experts, and the first meeting will be held soon. It is understood that prices have been rising steadily this year, and costs have gradually increased. The current cost is estimated to be close to 30 million yuan. The US market price, however, is only about 4.40 yuan, which translates to just over 7 million in national currency per dan, a difference of over 23 million. Merchants are unable to export, and even if the government buys it, the losses incurred would be too great, and the national treasury would not be able to bear the burden. Therefore, relevant parties generally advocate exporting in order to exchange for foreign materials.</p>
<p>Hardware Prices Rising</p>
<p>Recently, affected by the sharp rise in prices of all goods, hardware items have also seen price increases. Foreign nails are at 550,000, and three-legged steel saws and man-headed sandpaper are all rising.</p>
