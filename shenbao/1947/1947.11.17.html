<h3>于斌主敎在美演說　中國為民主而戰　通貨膨脹此爲主要原因</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕于斌主敎十五日向華盛頓中國文化學會董事會報吿稱：中國正爲民主而戰，以抵抗共匪，共匪係由蘇聯軍隊裝備，並一部份由蘇聯軍官指揮，中國並非在內戰，實爲反抗共產主義而作生死存亡之戰，此爲蘇聯發動反民主國際戰爭之起端。中共如謀在東北建設一獨立主權國家，第三次大戰即將開始。故稱中國之戰爭爲內戰，祗有一半眞確，中國之共產主義與其他各地之共產主義相同，係受蘇聯指揮。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕于斌主敎十五日稱：中國之反共戰爭，爲通貨膨脹之主要原因，通貨膨脹使中國經濟破產，並鼓勵無效率及貪汚之發生。于斌主敎稱；此次訪美，聆悉美方人士批評中國國民政府不民主，法西斯，非自由主義，但渠抨擊此種意見，認爲係共產黨往往稱對方爲法西斯。渠稱；蘇聯共產黨所領導之「國際縱隊」，其中包括朝鮮，蒙古及日本部隊與蘇聯軍官，現正在東北作戰，且在東北共軍中構成三分之一兵力。</p>
<h3>美國黨關切我國局勢　對援助問題態度則緩急各異</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕美參·衆兩院外交委員會，本週於聽取援歐計劃之報吿時，中國問題突然提出討論，各方對此，乃發生一項問題，是即共和·民主兩黨對中國問題列入目前緊急計劃一節，究竟何黨角有興趣。至今日止，共和黨議員及政界人士，在主張援華時，較民主黨爲先，其中以參院議長兼外委會主席范登堡爲首，並有塔虎脫·普魯斯特。史密斯·周以德·富爾頓等人。衆院共和黨議長馬丁，亦竭力主張立刻支援中國，另一共和黨要員紐約州長杜威，近亦力主援華。在國會一週討論中，民主黨人提及援華問題者，僅西佛吉尼亞衆議員基氏一人，基氏僅係偶然提及此事，渠請馬卿將美國對西歐之緊急援助與對華援助作一比較。馬歇爾對國務院之政策，向不自動叙述。必在壓力之下，始勉强宣布。渠估計遏止目前中國之通貨膨脹，需要三億美元，目前之問題，原爲共和黨何以對援華問題發表之意見，遠較民主黨爲急進，而共和黨人中，又顯然可分爲三派：一爲周以德及其他意見相同之人土，渠等認爲，中國之危機，如謂不較西歐國家更爲緊急，至少亦程度相等。渠等欲使中國列入緊急援助計劃之中。馬歇爾則認爲，中國之局勢雖嚴重，但尙可稍事等待，故可延至援歐計劃發生實效之後。馬卿一向承認美國必須援華，本週中則聲稱：援助至爲困難，迄今並未覓得滿意之解決方法。第二派爲范登堡及共和黨諸人士，渠等認爲，援華問題必須包括在美國之世界計劃之內，渠等並不欲迫使援華問題，列入緊急援助計劃，亦不堅持在特別國會中獲致決定。第三派，認爲對華援助純爲政治問題，此派人士以杜威及塔虎脫為首，渠等對大量貨款援華，並不過於急切，但攻擊杜魯門及國務院未將中國問題列爲整個世界大勢之一部分。據若干人士之意見，明年一月國會中，如不能對援華問題成立適當之計劃，則對華援助，將成爲總統競選中主要政治問題之一，此爲杜魯門所欲避免者。但目前共和黨無疑正在此一問題上聚集大選時之資本。其他觀察家則相信，民主黨對中國問題同樣關切，但因尙未決定如何進行，而致過於謹愼。據稱：民主黨領袖將靜待社魯門及馬歇爾之決策，以便開始援華之工作，僉信民主黨不欲在目前談論援華問題，亦係具有政治上之原因。若干人士揣測，民主黨欲使共和黨首先提出對華援助之建議，蓋如民主黨擬具全部外援計劃，則對美國納稅者所加之負担，未免太重，且由共和黨提出時，在國會中獲得款項，當較簡易。據某民主黨觀察家稱；目前欲將對華援助問題列入緊急救濟計劃之種種之論，乃誘使馬歇爾發表魏德邁報吿之企圖。</p>
<h3>立委選舉開始　三黨今會商候選人名額　國大開會日期可能延展</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立委選舉即將開始，而三黨名額分配尙未決定。頃悉，國民黨已定十七日午邀民社，靑年兩黨人士會商，可能即決定一項辦法。茲悉，靑年黨希望之名額爲一百二十名，民社黨希望之名額爲一百六十名，惟尙待會商決定。國民黨巾常會定十七日晨舉行臨時會，討論審查立委候選人名單辦法。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕某要員頃對記者談稱，大選決如期舉行，惟國大舉行期可能因事實問題而有所延展，其延展之方式有二：　爲舉行開幕式後，休會若干日再舉行會議，　即照去年方式，以召集令決定開會日期。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十五日電〕中國舉行普選，無諭何時均非易事，因全國性之選舉從未舉行故也，而內戰激烈，通貨膨脹，交通困難，更使中國在十一月二十一日至二十三日選舉國民大會代表三，〇二四名之舉，艱巨非凡。政府原擬在中央地區印發選票一億五千萬張，但交通困難，分發不易、不得不分區印製，流弊叢生，當可想見。估計選民十人中有七人爲文盲，故憲法所規定之秘密選舉，幾不可能。政府已雇用寫票員數千，屆時且由各地巾學生出動協助。選舉票並無候選大姓名，名單將以巨幅張貼各處，而選民又不識字，誠屬難於秘密。全國並無競選運動，僅南京各黨總部之間有所競爭。他處毫無行將選舉之跡象。若干中立觀察家認爲中國之選舉對民主事業不但無補益，且有傷害，蓋此非其時也。反對者則謂凡事必有開端，且選舉不完滿，亦聊勝於無。兩方面持論，均有理由，然蔣主席則決心使中國能於十一月廿一日至廿三日作史無前例之普選，以獲得民主矣。</p>
<h3>戴傳賢胡宗南等放棄國代候選人</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕戴院長頃函吳鐵城，朱家驊，陳立夫，張厲生諸氏，請代報吿中央，懇收回國代候選人之提名。</p>
<p>〔又電〕白祟禧夫人馬佩璋女士，前由南京回敎協會公推爲回民國代候選人，後因馬女士之一再堅辭，後經選舉指導委會核准，回敎協會頃特分電各省分會査照。</p>
<p>〔中央社西安十六日電〕西安綏署主任胡宗南，前經提名浙江孝豐原籍國代候選人，胡氏以當此期匪作戰緊張之際，不暇參加，已向中央呈請放棄。又陜主席祝紹周，亦因公務繁劇，業經致電杭市黨部，願將國代候選人提名放棄。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十六日電〕今日據可靠消息，國民黨方面自動放棄國代候選人資格者共三十五人，均屬高級軍官，陳誠，願祝同亦在其內。此為上星期內蔣主席勸告之結果。</p>
<p>〔中央社太原十六日電〕晋省監委選舉工作，已開始進行。十六日上午省參會召開選舉會，民政廳長李江代表閣監　　錫山出席說明進行程序，預定十九晶完成候選人提名程序，廿二日舉行投票，廿三日公告當選人名單。</p>

<h3>如何限制日本工業水凖？</h3>
<p>國際勞工組織亞洲區域籌備會議，已於十日在新德里閉會。該會通過我國代表的重要提案，爲確定日本工業水凖與反對傾銷；惟原案內容如何，迄未見報端公布。關於確定日本工業水凖問題，卽和經限制日本工業水凖問題，各國原已有方案提出，惟我國對案，尚付闕加。據悉行政院賠償委員會和經濟部，正積極搜集材料，詳細研究中。經濟部爲徵詢上海工業界意見，並派工業司長來滬，多方探求民間意見。上海工商業介，對此亦勇於貢獻。足徵限制日本工業水凖問題，殆已爲我國朝野極端關心的問題。如果我國不能正確提出對案，則八年戰塲上贏得的勝利，必將失敗於一紙和約之上。所以說：如何限制日本工業水凖問題，實應爲朝野所深切注意。</p>
<p>如何限制日本工業水凖，在學理上和技術上，應先決定如何保留日本的生活水凖。所謂工業水凖與生活水凖，兩者固截然不同：這是性質區別的不同，不是相互關係的不同。一國人民的生活水凖，應爲各項工業設備及其生產力的總和。一國人民的生活，需要工業來維持，則工業水凖是決定其生活水凖因素之一：但決非言生活水凖完全被工業水凖所決定。此其原因，第一因爲生活用品，並非全部由工業所生產，特別在所謂農業國家是如此；第二，因爲工業生產品，也並非完全爲維持其人民生活所必需，特別是軍需工業品是如此。所以討論限制日本工業水凖之際，應計算先決定保留某年度的生活水凖，進而決定應被保留的工業水凖，庶幾比較合理。</p>
<p>日本人民的生活水凖，應依何項凖則來作決定？波茨坦宣言第十一條規定：「日本將被維持其經濟所必需及可以償付貨物賠償之工業，但可以使其重新武裝作戰之工業，不在其內」。這裏所謂「被維持」的「經濟」，依一九四五年九月廿六日美國對日初步方針的解釋，是「和平的日本經濟」；如依美總統賠償專使鮑萊聲明，則爲「有用的最低限度的日本經濟」，此最低限度的和平經濟，是日本被維持的生活水凖。鮑萊並且解釋說：「不比日本所侵略的各國生活水凖爲高」此係言日本生活水凖不應比亞洲其他各國爲高。基於這個理論，鮑萊於一九四五年十二月七日發表了日本賠償計劃。據鮑萊說：本方案所表示的日本工業水凖，是依照一九二六—三〇年的日本生活水凖製成的。但美官方對鮑萊計劃有異議；出乎意料之外的，今年四月遠東委員會竟另外通過了斯坦克方案，「保留足以使其維持一九三〇—三四年，依此維持生活水凖所必需的工業，不能完全拆充賠償。斯坦克爲反賠償論的中堅，他的主張自然與鮑萊主張不同。他的主張自然是縱容日本而不利於盟國；所以中國與論反對遠東委員會的決定最激烈。照現在各國的與論看，還東委員會的籃本，很難在對日和會中成立的。</p>
<p>中國對這個問題；有權利提出意見。現在舉世注目對日和約經濟條款之際，已是我們提出對案的時機。王外長世杰從美日歸來，多次發表對日和約談話，僅注重和約程序問題，斤斤於爭辯蘇聯參加與否，在實質上却迴避談論到經濟條款；唯有參政會和民間團體，曁各地工業界，倒是切實注意這個問題。國勞亞洲區籌備會開會，我代表吳蘊初氏提出確定日本工業水凖問題，當卽獲得亞洲各國熱烈支持，尤足徵這個問題關係亞洲各國人民的生存，和亞洲各國工業的生命，決不能含糊因循放任過去。現在行政院賠償委員會和經濟部，注意到這個問題，並虛心探求各方意見，這是很重要的措施，可惜我們的外交當局似尚未十分重視。我們願對此一問題提供兩項意見：</p>
<p>（一）依波茨坦宣言的精神，日本經濟應被維持和平生活的經濟，其所需要之生活水凖，應以何年度何時期爲基凖，不可遽爾判斷，經率主張，應由專家依稱學方法計算出結論來。鮑萊主張，值得鄭重參考；斯坦克主張，不應重視；日本外務工商兩省的方案，尤其是利已損人，我們萬不能爲其所誘。</p>
<p>（二）保留日本生活的基凖決定了，再確定今後日本應保留之工業水凖。現有軍需工業及凖軍需工業，應拆充賠償及銷毀。財閥尤須澈底解散；因爲日本財閥潛伏了侵略性，他是亞洲各國工業生存的威脅。</p>
<p>以上兩點，應爲中國最低限度的主張。依此原則製成具體的對策。纔有正確的結論。我們所要求的，係工業落後國家，對一具有潛伏侵略性國家所持的防禦手段：我們所要求的，係日本被維持一合理工業水凖，內能適應人民合理要求的生活水凖，外而使亞洲各國不再有被侵略與匱乏之慮。我們不僅無意奴役日本人民，而且願意幫助日本經濟走向民主化。</p>

<h3>永利公司製碱廠日產碱八九十噸</h3>

<p>〔中央社天津十六日電〕永利化學公司塘沽廠，爲我國唯一之製碱廠，現每日僅能生產八九十噸，不足戰前產量二分之一，此乃由於淪陷期間，該廠由日人強佔經營，以其低劣之技術，使全部機器大受損傷所致，據李燭塵氏稱：戰前我國每年需碱約十二萬噸，半爲永利之產品，餘則賴英國輸入，勝利後，國內化學工業較前益爲發達，全國每年需碱達廿萬噸，而永利產量不足七萬噸，英國產品又限於交通，無法輸入，化學工業因此遭遇極大困難。李氏謂：華北產鹽甚豐，最宜設置碱廠，故主張仍應拆運日本碱廠，裝設於此，以解決我國之碱荒。</p>

<h3>印務織品不够自給</h3>
<p>田和卿自印歸來談</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕印度最近之政治經濟情勢，當爲國人所關切。據甫自印度返滬之工業家田和卿告記者：渠在印度時曾抽暇考究印度之紡織工業，目前擁有一千萬紡錠，但若干設備已甚陳舊，工人之效率亦不比我國高。印度生產原棉甚多，但因種種關係，品質有待改良。印度紡織品之出產，不足自給，目前各大城市有配給棉布之制度，市民列隊領取，故在相當時期內，印度紗布絕不能銷至我國市塲，甚至近在咫尺之南洋，亦無意問津。惟印度對於紡織業及其他主要工業，已確定一建設計劃，如局勢平靖，可望有進步。以印度目前之政局而論，雙方對壘，爭取土邦，流血衝突不絕，渠抵印時，客機時時誤點，亦可反映局勢緊張之一斑，在印度內亂中，外力亦有關係，特別在西北邊疆一帶，更有看出其有國際背境，英人表面似已撤離印度，但在經濟上甚至軍事上仍有控制力量，一切均在幕後主持。</p>

<h3>美國會特會揭幕　杜魯門定今晚親提咨文國內經濟問題將有激辯</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕國會議員今日絡續回京，準備明日舉行特別會議，討論援助及防止物價上漲事宜。特會較常會提早約七星期。是日標準時間下午六時三十分（上海時間星期二晨二時三十分），參眾兩在眾院大會堂舉行聯合會議，聽取杜魯門總統親自到院宣讀特別咨文。美金五億九千七百萬元緊急援法，義，奧三法案，已由國務卿馬歇爾提出，並已出兩院主管委員會先行從長計議一星期之久。杜魯門咨文對於如何防止國內通貨膨脹之威脅，外間尚無所知。長期援歐計劃與國內物價問題之間似有嚴重抵觸存在。長期援歐復興法案在國會於明年一月舉行常會前，不致正式提付參眾兩院討論。馬歇爾要求國會月底通過緊急援助法案，議員中有稱之為命式者。政府方面希望對外救濟法案能以兩黨一致或無黨派觀念之立塲從事討論，惟於國內經濟問題討論時定必具有政治色彩。下屆大選為時已不到一年，民主共和國黨自必利用機會到物價上漲之咎歸之對方，以冀取得選舉人之擁護。總統及國會領袖均　特別會議案中討論兩項主題，竭力避免橫生枝節，如减稅法案已決定延至常會討論。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統關於反通貨膨脹之方案，迄未宣示，消息靈通方面預料該方案之內容，將包含下列數點：（一）由政府管制外援所需稀貴物資之來及分配，若鋼鐵，氮化肥料，可能且包括小麥；（二）限制放款，並恢復對分期付款購買制度之管制；（三）增加防止基本物品投機之管制，若小麥等糧食品；（四）延長出口管制。此外杜魯門並將强調其對於稅制之意見，渠將竭力反對减稅，以防通貨膨脹，並將建議援歐物資以稅收支付。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕外交當局今日宣稱，杜魯門總統擬請國會規定於任何長期援歐方案中，至少六十億元向拉丁美洲及加拿大採辦物資，以减少美國資源之消耗。</p>
<h3>史汀生呼籲援歐　聲明援歐目的不在反蘇發動民眾促成馬卿計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕戰時美陸軍部長史汀生今要求加速援助受共產主義威脅之歐洲各國，史氏在其宣佈成立馬歇爾援歐計劃無黨無派委員會（史氏為主席）之聲明中宣稱！美國之援歐政策並非反蘇政策，而為願望援助苦難人民之善鄰行為。史氏認為歐洲各國之受共產主義威脅，純由於納粹發動戰爭後果所引起之飢餓恐慌所致。渠稱：「余認為吾人應迅速採取行動。稽延之懲罰，即為增加工作之困難。」史氏領導之委員會下，將設置執行小組委會（由前陸軍部長柏德遜主席）及全國會議，其會員包括工商宗敎及敎育等各界領袖二百餘人，彼等將發動一百萬人生簽名運動，請求國會批准馬卿計劃。</p>

<p>〔路透社英格蘭勃星斯托爾十五日電〕貝文外相在比間工會紀念節之集會演說，對歐洲國家之未能全部參加討論馬歇爾方案之巴黎會議，表示遺憾。渠並曰：「在余任職外相期間，從他人不願協議，余亦決不為保持世界混亂狀態之一份子。」繼又曰：「美國將盡其可能協助歐洲國家之從事互助，美國不欲統治歐洲，而為責成歐洲國家負起責任。此亦本人亟欲得使英產煤斤，明日即可與丹麥成立訂購　肉，鷄蛋，牛油之協定，本人對於他人對我之責難，並不重視。若欲根據今日一般人之理論，若共產主義以抗資本主義，或某某主義對某某主義，以解決世界問題，決不能有解決得了的一天，反而將引起更多的糾紛。余希望美國能起而把握此一機會，本人決盡力與美國合作，以結束目前歐洲之困苦。」</p>
<h3>美當局考慮取締共產黨</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十五日電〕關係觀察家相信：美國最近之趨勢，將在今後數日內引起美國最高法院之考慮美國共產黨之命運，及美兵人員在人權法案下之權利。目前眾院非美活動委員會之調查好萊塢共黨活動，意在獲取與論之支持該會即將於國會下屆例會中考慮之兩法案：一為共和黨議員孟特所統治或控制之任何組織之人員，須依照外國間諜登記法向當局登記，另一由民主黨議員倫金所提之案，規定對共黨之政治活動予以嚴格限制，如共產黨人不得充各州或聯邦公務員，公私學校敎師，不得傳播或表示對共產主義之同情，經由美國郵政機構企圖傳佈親共出版物者，得處一萬元以下罰金，或並處十年以下徒刑。</p>
<h3>美國民意測驗僉主對蘇强硬</h3>
<p>〔合眾社紐約十五日〕蓋洛浦民意測騐所最近之結果顯示，雖蘇外長莫洛托夫曾暗示蘇聯亦有原子彈，美國人民仍主張對蘇採取强硬政策。測騐者暗示稱：蘇聯亦有此項可怖武器，然主張對蘇宜較緩和之人數並顯著之增加。「世界情報」雜誌報告：美國普遍討論戰爭，華盛頓為之大感驚惶云。</p>
<h3>暗殺前王案　嫌疑犯被捕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社曼谷十六日電〕　羅新政府今日宣布捕獲暗殺故王馬希道之嫌疑犯七人，另有一人在逃。據陸軍司令部發言人稱，在逃者為前總理巴諾榮之秘書薛特希維，至於潘諾榮本則下落未明。被捕七人中，一為故王秘書，二為宮中侍役，四為廚房工人。副統帥鍾豪稱，已有確實證據證明先王係遭毒手。</p>
<h3>外長會議難樂觀　英國貝文外相發出呼籲安定大局勿失最後良機</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕美政府之準備向國會提出援歐方案，與四强外長會議之即將討論德國問題，已發生更接近之連繫。外長會議之接近，使美國政府處理援歐方案，益增其急迫性。</p>
<p>然於讀及哈里曼委員會報告書關於德國部份之建議後，即使人不禁感覺如果此項建議被完全採納，則德國經濟統一之希望，必將愈益淡薄。美共和黨外交專家杜勒斯之主張於蘇聯拒絕防止德國再侵略之四强四十年公約時，即由英美法三强進行此約之締結，不失為一驚人建議。杜勒斯雖未佔有官職，然渠之建議將防止德國再侵略之保障，變為近乎反共公約之一種約定，可以顯示美國與論對於德國問題拖延不決之不耐煩。若干人士已有肯定的預料本屆外長愈必致失敗，而德國之分裂亦勢所難免。</p>
<p>〔聯合社勃里斯托爾十五日電〕英外相貝文今夜在此演說稱，未來之四國外長會議，殆將為獲得協議之最後機會。甚望該會能從歐洲之根本事實着想。吾人當本理智而勿存恐慌，吾人倘欲根據現有之理想以安定世界大局（如共產主義針對資本主義之類），吾人即不能安定，唯有促使更大之混亂而已。</p>

<p>〔路透社羅馬十五日電〕義全境動亂不已，東南部之塞里諾拉，已陷於無法控制之局面，警察無法應付，已向巴里城乞援。該地憲兵司令部已被帬眾包圍，警察以手溜彈及步槍作殊死鬥，死傷眾多，確數尚未查明。當地警局長身受重傷。未證實之報告，謂死者及傷者槪由插白旗之車輛載運。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十六日電〕總工會今日致書加斯貝利總理，表示深願避免內戰，並列舉停止暴動三項條件：（一）解散義大利社會運動中之新法西斯組織；（二）盡力取締一般新法西斯主義；（三）禁止反民主刊物。</p>
<h3>法總統召宴各政黨領袖　籌組中間性政府　力謀阻遏左右兩派攻勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕法國中間政黨領袖原定今夜聚餐，討論解決當前政治經濟困難之方法，臨時突宣告改期，改為由歐禮和總統於十六日午刻宴社會黨，人民共和旁聽，急進黨，及獨立保守派領袖，並舉行晤談。</p>
<p>關係方面相信，此項晤談乃為企圖以協議方法，籌組各中間派政黨之強力政府，明日之午宴設在巴黎近郊邦本埃之總統官邸，參加者預料有外長皮杜爾·軍務部長泰特瑟·財長舒曼（人民共和黨領袖）·賴瑪迪總理·前總理左翼領袖莫萊（以上社會黨）·國會議長赫利萊（以上社會黨）·國會議長赫利歐（急進黨）·及前總理萊諾（獨立保守黨領袖）。政界人士相信，此一午宴乃賴瑪迪政府於十月廿八日獲得信任票以來中間黨派幕後活動之最高峯。此項活動之目的，在但織強力之中間政府，以抗極右派戴高樂派，及極左黨共產黨之攻勢。此一計劃之主動者為社會黨前輩勃魯姆，渠會告知社會黨領袖，若中間派失敗而由戴高樂奪得政權，則共和政權即將宣告死亡。共產黨對於中間派籌組之「第三派勢力」攻擊亦不遺餘力。</p>
<h3>英前財相可望復職</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕此間關係方面稱：前財相道爾頓，在一年以內可望重入內閣，一部份支持政府之人士，對於引起道爾頓辭職之事件可能發生的後果，逐漸感覺不安，甚至感覺工黨內部可能引起裂痕。預料於反對黨要求之調查道爾頓失職案在下院舉行辯輪時，關於道氏未來之地位，可有一較明朗之推斷。</p>
<h3>英儲君婚期近　結婚蛋糕富麗矞皇</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十六日電〕此間宣布：伊麗莎白公主婚禮之日。自白金漢宮至威斯特敏斯特寺，沿途將由英國軍隊之各部份担任警衛。同時公主之結婚蛋糕已快完成，糕高九呎，重五百磅，凡四層，糕上佈滿產自帝國各地之鮮菓及白色奶油，調以牙買加及特里尼達特特產之白蘭地及燒酒五品脫半，飾以代表幸福之金色七種物件，即鈕扣·戒指·針箍·　錢幣·懷想骨及馬蹄，以及新夫婦所喜從事各種體育運動之圖案。糕之裝飾費時五星期之久。</p>
<p>外國記者獲准觀禮〔中央社倫敦十五日電〕本月二十日英公主伊麗莎白與蒙巴頓上尉大婚之期，各處新聞人員申請觀禮者達四百人以上，但由于威斯敏士特寺內座位之限制，四百申請人中僅九十二名獲得席位，其中一半為英新聞人員，二十席為英帝國及自治領之新聞界，十二席為美國新聞界，而此十二席中，有一席即為中國記者，即中央社是也。</p>

<h3>吉田幣原獲致協議　日內閣風雨飄搖　蘆田表示並不支持片山</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十六日電〕權威方面悉：吉田與幣原十四日會談組織保守新黨問題，意見已完全一致。據傳民主黨內部之分裂，即將以煤礦國營問題為導火綫，實則背後主力仍係保守新黨運動之鼓動云。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十六日電〕日本第一國會，因煤礦國營案之糾紛，又必需延期一週，其理由為政府之與黨之修正案，由於社會·民主兩黨之意見對立，二三日內不能提出眾院工礦委員會，而參院亦曾言明，若不於十五日交付參院，則不負不按照日期通過之責任。惟自由黨絕對反對國會再度延期，故片山內閣之暗雲，正方興未艾。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十六日電〕民主黨總裁蘆田於出席山形縣民主黨大會途次，十六日於福島發表談話稱：傳民主黨恐將由煤礦國營法案而告分裂，惟余覺不至如此，恐僅二三名主張絕對反對該法案之工鑛委員脫黨而已。至於和會問題，應由深得國民信賴之內閣担當之，余不相信所謂現非片山內閣不可之說。又關於派赴和會之日本全權代表，尚未銓衡其人選。</p>
<h3>下屆聯大會議　決定在歐舉行</h3>
<p>〔中央社弗魯辛十五日電〕聯合國大會今以卅二票對十七票，五票棄權，決定明年在歐洲舉行會議，至於開會之城市尚須特別九人委員會決定。先是中英兩國極力反對遷移地點，蓋此舉將消耗聯合國百萬美元，並使此世界組織處於某種程度之程序困難中。因欲增加預算時，勢須三分二之多數票，而今日通過之決定，僅過半數而已，是以投反對票之十七國家，可能對於明年遷移建議之必需費用加以阻止。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統宣布設立效忠審查會　不忠份子不容供職政府</h3>

<h3>朝鮮僵憶局</h3>
<p>— 美國Collier's週刊發行人W．L．Chenery　本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>假如我們能够獲得一個退出朝鮮而使蘇聯不致得寸進尺的辦法，我們情願快快退出朝鮮。</p>
<p>朝鮮境內北緯三十八度界綫那裏的美軍哨兵站，或許是所有佔領區中最寂寞的一個所在了。在佔領剛開始的時候，蘇聯方面的哨兵站和我們的相當接近，有時雙方的兵士談談話，頗爲融洽。但是這些都已成過去。目前，雙方的哨兵均已向後轉移，以免發生意外。鐵路軌道的旁邊，貼了標語，警告走的人不要走錯了地帶，因爲假如我們不當心從美軍佔領區走到了蘇軍佔領區，就有遭遇射擊的危險。</p>
<p>在過去兩年中，美國人曾經有過一次機會到朝鮮蘇軍佔領區去。今年四月間，美國第七步兵師的兵士廿三人和軍官六人，曾經會同蘇方人員，進行測量北緯三十八度的工作。他們和蘇聯人在一起工作和居住了若干天，當時各人曾把所見所聞記錄下來。蘇聯方面不造成這個集體的報告，所以沒有發表，但我（本文作者）碰巧獲得了一份，內容大致如下：</p>
<p>配備—蘇聯士兵所備的個別武器，當心得很周到，品質也很好，但是已經極舊。汽車都是一再修理過的。在蘇軍區所看到的車輛，幾乎全部都是美國貨，這是戰時蘇軍根據租借協定獲得的。使用這些車輛的人，似乎旣缺乏物資又缺乏知識，不能保持它們完好的狀態。測量隊中蘇方人員的使用的吉普車，屢次動彈不得。</p>
<p>服裝—蘇聯士兵所穿的服裝，式樣不同，數量不足，並且破舊。他們的制服大部份是用好的質料做的，但是已經太舊和太髒。大多數的蘇聯人沒有襪子穿，在穿上皮靴之前，先把破布和脚裹起來。靴也舊得可以，幾乎不堪使用了，有以一次，蘇方人員在卅八度南美軍地帶過夜，許多蘇聯人拒絕洗澡，因爲他們說裏面沒有內衣可換，所以無法保持身體的清潔。</p>
<p>生活情形——測量隊中的高級人員最好也不過睡不牀和簡陋的鐵牀，上面舗的是草墊，但是大多數蘇聯兵都睡在地板上，褥墊都是很贓的。洗澡等設備都沒有，祇有溪水和井水。蘇聯兵祇要就近找得到水，就把它洗澡和充作飲料，一點不做清潔的工作。</p>
<p>食物——第七師的官兵和蘇聯人生一起時吃得很好。他們大多數人認爲由於蘇聯兵士身體相當康健，必須有好一點的食物，但有種處事實，顯示他們的食糧大部份是靠當地供給的。</p>
<p>士氣和紀律——第七師中大部份兵士認蘇聯兵的士氣似乎頗高。服役的人都是年輕的，但是極少數具有作戰經驗。他們似乎頗快樂，但是像大多數美國兵一樣，他們談話的時候大都講到家，大家似乎都想離開朝鮮，回到蘇聯去。</p>
<p>一般以爲蘇聯兵的軍訓程度頗高。或許在我們之上。蘇聯的服役人員年齡雖輕，大多數人都是很早參加兵役的；他們在軍隊中已經服役的時間，較同年齡的美國兵爲長。</p>
<p>蘇聯人在朝鮮北部已經組織了一個爲數的約十五萬至二十萬人的朝鮮軍隊。在美軍佔領區，並沒有把軍隊組織起來。雖然霍奇將軍已經訓練了少量的警察隊，爲數不過二萬八千人。所以蘇聯隨時可以把這枝朝鮮軍隊派到南部來，而在朝鮮全境建立一個共產政府。假如這種事情眞的發生，霍奇將軍是沒有充份軍隊可以防止其侵入的。</p>
<p>假如蘇聯決定命令朝鮮人向南進攻，美國軍隊祇有儘速退却，但是問題並不到此爲止。蘇聯可以佔領朝鮮，但是目前蘇聯不能佔領日本。日本人以爲蘇聯正在覬覦日本的土地，資源，和人力。這是日本希望美國繼續佔領日本一個長時期的基本理由。</p>
<p>我們留在朝鮮，担任着一椿討厭而又危險的工作，就是希望阻止共產主義向世界其他部份擴張開來。假如我們能够獲得一個退出朝鮮而使蘇聯不致得寸進尺的辦法，我們情願快快離開朝鮮。</p>
<p>朝鮮人不希望我們走，但是我們在可以走的時候，總是希望立刻就走的。問題也在我們怎樣和日本以及在某種程度和中國商議出一個辦法來。我們在遠東太平洋區能够建立怎樣的防禦？這問題，對於我們自已的將來以及我們在朝鮮留駐的久暫，都有決定的作用的。</p>

<h3>天目路拆屋難執行住戶願與屋共存亡　參議員請准予展緩半年</h3>
<p>本市天目路拆屋拓路第一期經工務局規定先行拆除妨礙路綫之十四家，昨晨該局特派員會同警局前往强制執行。但該十四家住戶，仍堅不遷讓，並宣稱願與住屋共存亡，致陷入僵局，無法執行。北站警察分局長應志春，因恐發生意外事故，出而勸導居民無效，遂請工務局暫緩一天執行，一面並限令居民即將重要物件搬出云。</p>
<p>又訊：該區參議員陶百川昨往謁潘議長，爲該處居民請命，要求准予緩期六個月。潘氏當即電請吳市長允諾。惟市長表示，無法收回此成命。又據潘氏談稱：拆除此十四家住屋，延至明年初執行，似無大礙，該處居民藉以可渡過年關。</p>
<h3>亞洲勞工會議預備會議結束</h3>
<p>田和卿返滬談會議經過</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕亞洲勞工會議預備會議此次在印度新德里國民大會堂召開，自十月二十七日開幕至十一月八日結束。我國出席代表除包華國飛渝，吳蘊初滯港外，其餘田和卿等已於十四日返滬。田氏昨與記者詳談會議經過稱：此次預備會議性質爲討論準備於一九四九年在中國召開之第一屆亞洲勞工會議中提出之議題，主要目的在求如何保障工人生活，如何增加工人收入，以及如何發展工業，穩定經濟。遠東國家除日本，朝鮮，印尼外，其餘均派代表參加。大會中共討論提案三十餘條，以印度提出者最多。我國提出九條，其中一關於限制日本工業發展使其不能再以傾銷政策危害亞洲其他國家一案，經大會再三討論後通過。</p>
<p>所有提案歸納四組</p>
<p>所有提案經大會歸納為四組：　行動綱領組，關於最低工資，工作時間，女工夜工等等，如何使國際勞工局之規定在較之歡洲工業水準相去甚遠之亞洲實行。　社會安全組，關於社會保險，工人收支保障，醫藥衛生實施等等建議。　勞工政策組，包括技術訓練，工人僱用，取締包工制度，女工童工待過，工人住宅，台作事業等等之建議。　一般性的審査及建議，如何發展亞洲經濟，改進生產技術，將鄕村過剩人口，移轉於工業生產等等。各項通過之提案，將送交國際勞工局根據原則，組織考察團調査團硏究事實，求得結論，於後年第一次大會時再詳細討論。</p>
<p>勞資代表對立尖銳</p>
<p>田氏又稱：此次預備會議中，勞資雙方代表對立甚爲尖銳，政府代表則居中折衝。每次大會前。勞方資方先各有小組會議，俾統一各國代表意見，採取一致行動。雖然如此，此種集政府及勞資等三方共同討論之方式，仍不失爲解決勞資糾紛之最好辦法。田氏等此行並曾訪問尼赫魯與甘地，尼赫魯膚色甚爲白晰，甘地則並非瘦骨伶仃而體格極佳，雖以七十八歲高齡，胸前仍不見一根肋骨，故代表團中有「尼赫魯不黑，甘地不乾」之戲言，亦此行之趣聞也。</p>
<h3>商會商品陳列所國產品搜羅完備</h3>

<h3>空運營業激增八月來加十倍</h3>
<p>國內民航事業，於二年中有長足發展，尤以本年一月至八月間，不論戰貨，郵件，乘客均增加數倍。據中央航空公司負責人稱：是項著遍激增之原因，由於水陸交通因共匪破壊而時阻時通，而空運則反較陸運安全且迅速，因此貨運。客運。郵件等，均趨向空運，而造成營業激增。據該公司營業報吿，八月份較正月份貨運增加十倍，客運增加三倍，郵件增加二倍，並且預料今後之空運，因民航大衆化，而更形繁忙，故最近兩民航公司均有計劃添購新機或增開航縣。</p>
<h3>節約運動收效供電情形轉佳</h3>
<p>昨據公用局負資人稱，本市供電情形，確已改進，其原因有三：　生活指數高漲，工人待遇提高，工作效率增加。　節約運動已見收效。　備有發電機之工廠，均已相繼自行發電，並將一半電量供應他廠。惟每屆冬季，因電熱之消耗量激增，輒鬧電荒，除竭力開源外，尙希市民節琉，始可安渡此嚴重性之電荒時期。</p>

<h3>津浦中段踏勘　兗濟段　亟須通車</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南十三日航訊〕津浦區鐵路管理局所從事的兗州濟南段舖軌工程，昨天消息傳來，爲了短少枕木，已經停工有三天之久了。據關係方而訊，所有兗濟段被破壊路綫一六四公里，截至目前，所有路基土方卅七萬公方，已全部完成，大小橋樑三百六十座已完成三百四十座，僅小橋廿座，路面卅公里因短少</p>
<p>枕木七萬根</p>
<p>遂成停工待料之勢。記者爲此，不得不爲山東的三千八百萬人民向交通部發出最迫切的呼籲。同時爲求瞭解搶修工程實際情况，也不得不冒着北國寒風，於一片黃沙中由濟南沿着鐵路到泰安作津浦中段兗濟間北段的實地踏勘。</p>
<p>是十三日淸晨，當車過炒米店時，在同行的路局工務處宋課長建坊說明下，發現炒米店至崗山的七公里路面，因枕不短少，每十公尺長鋼軌僅塡四至六根枕木，勉可通行</p>
<p>輕便摩托車</p>
<p>實際上如按規定標準，十公尺長鋼軌，應塡十四至十五根枕木，始可行駛特別快車，目下爲枕木短少，所有兗濟段皆一律改爲每軌十二根枕木，因此只能行駛慢車及普通快車，待將來情况改善，如欲恢復特別快車時，此項短舖枕木，仍得予以加補。</p>
<p>由崗山至萬德間廿公里全未舖軌，原有員工，因無枕木，除一部繼續搶建泰安濟南間</p>
<p>兩座大橋樑</p>
<p>石甸河橋（張夏南五公里）及萬魚河橋（萬德南二公里）外，其餘員工，都只可用來整理己修路綫及担任掩護工作。</p>
<p>據局方估計，即以每十公尺軌，需塡十二根枕木計，由萬懲至崮山廿公里，加上炒米店至崗山七公里，再加岔道等，合計不下四十公里，就需枕木四萬八千根，另廿架小橋需塡枕木二萬二千根，總計至少非七萬根枕木無法完成兗濟段的通車。主要的就是由於枕木短少，否則，即無須待至月底，即本月廿日亦可完成濟南浦口間的通車。</p>
<p>主管全國鐵道業務的交通部對於枕木一項，據設還有相當的存儲量，但此項材料據說準備用在恢復浙贛綫及江南鐵路，在交部的意思，該地比較安全，津浦中段修復了正不知是否將踏膠濟路後塵一樣能通好久，但今天政府的最高國策旣定軍事第一，戡亂第一，那末，即就</p>
<p>純軍事意義</p>
<p>言，徐濟段的亟應修復，在主管部門是責無旁貸，聯總對我國經度三十四度以北鐵路村料可以藉口戰亂不予補給，但交部可不能完全爲了自己一個部門的收入盈餘上打算盤，而置國策民命於不顧。</p>
<p>總之，在客觀需要上兗濟段至遲於本月底非完成通軍不可，賢明的交部主管當局，自然不致爲此區區七萬根枕木而坐令該路爲山九仭，功虧一簣。（由交部言，七萬根枕木爲數委實算不上什麼。）</p>
<p>兗濟段通車</p>
<p>後，在最初若干時，為了顧及旅客的安全，在徐濟段雖不開行夜車，在兗徐兩站並都需要換車，故戰前僅需十五小時就可由浦口到濟南的，現在是需要兩天一夜的行程，但鐵路的主要收入固不在客運而在貨運，今後山東的麥豆、花生，棉花，皮革，玉蜀黍等農產品的大量出口，在津浦路局方面的最低限度估計，如無意外，則月入一萬五千億至兩萬億當無問題，假使天津以南唐姑屯至濟南以北桑南站的二六八公里再繼續打通並修復，換言之，即整個津浦路重行通車後，其對國內軍事政治經濟上的價值和意義，自然是更不待言喻了。</p>
<p>站在被窒息了九個月的山東人的立塲上，對於津浦路徐濟段的恢復通車，正無異和重見自由與光明一樣。（本報特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>全市運動會　圓滿閉幕　樓文敖出人頭地　萬米破全國紀錄　中學團體操各類名次評定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第五屆全市運動會圓滿閉幕，昨日最後一日，各項競賽成績極爲優異。衆目翹望下之一萬公尺決賽，啞吧樓文敖以卅二分卅一秒二之成績獲得第一，王正林亦以卅四分之成績榮獲亞軍，二人均擊破卅四分一秒之萬米全國紀錄。惟昨日會塲風勢强勁，致樓文敖未能突破其本人所保持之卅二分丸秒六之最高紀錄，殊堪惋惜。此外高中男生組二百公尺決賽，緝紮中學之容承彪以廿二秒八接近全國耙錄，亦爲昨日大會圓滿收穫之一。至團體得分方面：大專組市立體專獲得女子冠軍及男子亞軍，得分最多。大專男子錦標則爲東亞體專取得。中學部份男子高初中冠軍，格致與緝紮平分秋色，育才則獲雙項亞軍。女子組市一女中獲得高中冠軍及初中亞軍，民立女中則獲得初中冠軍及高中亞軍。公開組方面朱沙飛以十六分獲得個人錦標，該組因參加人數不多，而鉛球因闖宏達棄欋，標槍王學武因受逆風影響，成續俱見遜色。至各項錦標聞將另行定期在市體育館舉行給獎儀式，此一輝煌之盛會，經五日來數千健兒角逐競爭，各項節目均圓滿結束，大會遂於一片歡呼聲中宣吿閉幕。茲將各組團體得分及昨日決賽成績分誌於後：</p>

<h3>台省體育訪問團　昨飛返上海</h3>
<p>記者國收穫豐富</p>
<p>本市體育記者聯誼會主辦之上海記者台灣體育訪問團，一行十人於本月六日搭中興輪離滬，自到達台北，計共逗留八天，在台北台中台南高雄等處考察，收穫頗豐，全團除王微君因事尙須勾留二天外，其餘九人，由領國張葆奎率領，已於昨日上午十一時搭中航機離台北，台省新聞處長林紫貫，記者公會理事長葉開動，以及新聞界同人，均至機塲歡送，該機十一時零五分起飛，下午二時抵達龍葉機塲。</p>
<h3>毛腿似飛一馬當先玉臂輕展三元連中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日大會最精彩的節目是一萬公尺決賽，樓文敖畢竟不負大衆期望，衝破全國紀錄。此公雖然五官失聰，但在跑道上却勇冠三軍，愈跑愈快。他的成績是三十二分卅一秒二，在到達五千公尺的時候是十六分四十二秒，全程二十五圈，算每圈（約四百公尺）平均費時未曾超過一分二十秒。</p>
<p>公開組萬米決賽中有一小英雄汪友寓參加，他雖然年僅十六歲，但跑完全程祗需四十分鐘，誠可謂前程無限。</p>
<p>因爲樓文敖口耳失靈，替他計算圈數的栽判員大傷腦筋，每跑完一圈，裁判就以手勢示意，但深恐他未盡明瞭，最後一圈特地又用發令槍在他眼前先起一響。結果裁判汗流浃背，大呼「啞吧眞難應付」不止。</p>
<p>大會揭幕五日，日炙風吹，司令台上的紅綢帳幔已成白色，塲地上則釘痕展跡，百孔千瘡，紙屑紛飛中，松節油氣味猶飄拂太空。</p>
<p>市立體專女生顏竟愚，參加三鐵及壘球競賽，獲得三項第一，一項第三，市體賽此次女子錦標之獲得，關鍵實繫於此。</p>
<p>童軍罷崗·一塲風波</p>
<p>昨日會塲秩序，一度曾稍有紊亂，司令台上吿誡童子軍負起責任，結果有某校訓育主任認爲報吿員語氣中有侮辱實軍之處，上台交涉，全體童子軍亦憤而罷崗，嗣經調解解決。塲外觀衆不明究竟，頗爲這突如其來的風波納罕不置。</p>
<p>此次市運會最遺憾的是公開組女子競賽竟付缺如，據說這是因爲人數不足之故。連日黃明援等在塲內袖手旁觀，見女學生們沙塲雄，有聲有色，似頗露髀肉復生之感。</p>
<p>體壇前輩兼市運會名譽副會長郝更生昨日上午亦蒞塲參觀，麥克風內特地爲他播送了一條消息，引得全體注目。</p>
<p>大會五天中，招領失蹤小孩的事件計發生十八起，每次擴聲機內報吿招領的時候，這些小孩都有特別標記：嘴角生瘡的，手裏拿着甘蔗的，穿着空軍童裝的，名字叫「月英」的……。</p>
<p>麥克風裏報吿員有時打起道地京片子，韻味醇厚，惟發音俱欠準確，有一次報吿：「高男女」四百公尺接力同時準備！冗長緩慢，在下風逖聽的觀衆都互詢：什麽？「狗男女」？……</p>
<p>空中裂帛·悅耳醒目</p>
<p>緝　中學昨在四百公尺接力賽中，連得高初中雙料第一，於是大奏軍架，燃放鞭砲，叮咚劈拍之聲延續五分鐘久，塲內空氣爲之緊張不少。</p>
<p>競賽到最高潮時，場週歡呼喝彩之聲久不息，有人會爲這些歡呼聲作分類統計：像狼嗥猿啼的是大專男生，亢急而有力；似鑛鳴鼓響的是一般觀眾，悠長而沉重；如空中烈帛的是女同學，尖銳二有輕鬆。</p>

<h3>逸園足球大戰　馬華靑白和局　各一未分勝負大戰</h3>
<p>馬來亞聯華足球隊，昨日下半三時，與靑白作征滬第二戰，逸園球迷，人山人海，歡呼聲，爆竹聲，響澈雲宵，觀衆統計當在萬人以王，球塲情緒，較首戰更爲熱烈。蔣經國，緯國兩氏之大人，以及錢大鈞等，亦均作壁上觀。角逐結果，上半時聯華首先中的，下半時靑白還敬一球，一比一握手言和。昨日形勢緊張，互有得失，競爭至烈。賽畢，靑白歡宴遠征軍於上海酒樓。雙方列陣如下：</p>
<p>聯華</p>
<p>朱志成</p>
<p>陳家萬　張國興</p>
<p>楊嘉松　李以耀　巫錦成</p>
<p>梅潤華　謝文良　夏體先　胡文柏　黃國棟</p>
<p>靑白</p>
<p>秦必高</p>
<p>吳凱敏上　李義臣下　吳祺祥</p>
<p>張仁義　翟永福　薛沛然</p>
<p>哈增明下　金祿生　羅壽福上　李義臣下　高秀淸　顧以撒下　姜閻淸</p>
<p>馬華先中</p>
<p>雙方隊長，互贈隊旗，裁判鄧效良鳴笛開賽，青白順風，聯華開球，夏體先率軍進擊，二分鐘後，青白反攻，瞿永福於卅號處遙射，朱志成接住彈出，混戰至七分鐘，夏體先梅潤華黃國棟三騎並進，夏突施冷箭，未會中的。三分鐘後，靑白傾全力進逼，高秀淸深入腹地，祿生搭住力射，爲張國興阻成角球。雙方互有進攻，客軍形勞殊緊。十二分鐘時，客軍否極泰來，靑白門前，險象環生，胡文相近門試射，秦必高撲出不遠，夏體先載得，向右輕撥，胡文相拉起一脚，應聲人網，一比〇打開紀錄。靑白大舉反攻，皆無成就，上半時完畢，聯華以一比〇佔先。</p>
<p>靑白還擊</p>
<p>休息過後，易地再戰，客軍陣容未動，靑白則大事更張，吳凱敏舊創復發，李義臣退任右後衛，羅壽福下野，顧以撒登塲，與高秀淸互易位置，哈增明出任左翼，金祿生內移。青白經此調整，前鋒清一色年輕小將，進攻力備見充實，後防老將，守衛亦見嚴密。七分鐘時，姜闖清右路輿兵，長傳中央，高秀清虛擺華容道，陳家萬錯過金祿生，乘虛而入，搭住力射，球出清晰美觀，朱志成目瞪口呆，目送入網，一比一青白扮成和局。客軍陣線漸見散漫，混戰至一刻鐘時，青白擬以謝啓川入替薛沛然，裁判未許作罷，至廿五分鐘時，姜闖清腳傷離場，二分鐘後，客軍黃國棟亦因左手臂骨受傷下野，雙方均以十人作戰，未幾姜闖清再度入場，嗣後雙方進攻互見，均無樹建，時間吿終，一比一雙方握手言和。</p>

<h3>中國擁護法提案　肅淸膚色歧視</h3>
<p>業經聯敎程序委會通過</p>

<p>據姜氏談此行經過云：前次赴美純係私人游因性質，一爲聯絡舊有客戶，次爲參觀紐約硝皮廠，硏究其製作方法，而作改良我國皮貨出口事業之借鏡。蓋我國硝製工作，墨守成規，其出品難於國際市塲中與他國競爭。例如吾國硝皮原料，以米是尙，彼等則利用藥水，製皮則用機器，我則依賴工人。且美國每以我國轍出之貨，加工複製，轉運歐陸各地求售，獲利甚豐。再如製造地毯工廠，樓高六七層，每層爲製造每一部份，由乾洗，分淸，揀選，染色，織紗，以至完成，無不依賴機器。在戰前此項原料，均由我國輸入，取其柔靸適宜踐踏時富有彈性，目前我國業此者，改絃易轍，輸出數量甚徽，彼輩乃取本國出口品替代，甚有漸漸忘却我國組羊毛爲地毯最上等原料之處，此點實堪重視。此次返國，決擬邀集同業，共商復興良策。</p>
<p>姜氏述及美國篆養黃狼及玄狐，以求產品之劃一問題，頗饒興趣。渠略稱：黃狼生殖力强大，篆養者爲提高種子優良計，一俟交尾後，即個別豢養，取皮時寗割雄留雌。平時食物飼以魚，馬肉，麥粉，魚肝油，禁食脂肪，結果產品光潔柔滑，每張可値二十美元。若一牧畜塲擁有黃狼千頭，繁殖四倍後，產皮四千張，總値可運八萬美元，除去成本，頗可獲利。每年美加兩地可共銷一百萬張，玄狐毛長，紐約媂女時裝不喜長毛，其產品每運至加拿大等地求售。吾以爲欲求擴展我國黃狼皮銷路，改良品種，實爲當前急務。若由美輸人黃狼種，氣候亦極相宜，小規模試辦，約需美金五萬元。至改良硝製，則更須延聘技師，購買機器，耗資愈大，短時間不能一蹴可就，有待經濟穩定，集合同志，詳爲策劃。</p>
<p>姜氏復述及推動皮毛出口，其若干部份不妨酌參寄售方式，試觀我國之羊頭耳鼻尾爪等皮，每被廢棄，倘精工嵌製成衣，運銷國外，可能引起美國婦女之好奇心，而受數迎。此非熱貨，推銷方法，不外預約時裝店寄售展覽，一經採購，漸可風行一時。關於此點，不日當向輸出入管理委員會有所建議。</p>
<p>最後姜氏稱，我國去年度向美銷去黃狼皮約三百萬張，最初開價甚佳，後以貨湧跌至二元以內，平均可値每張二三元不等。湖羊皮共銷五十餘萬張，每張値美金一元，靑羊皮一百萬張，最初可値三元餘，後跌至一元。今春已輸出黃狼皮（去年貨）約四十萬張，實際產量爲六十萬張，內銷者二十萬張。按之正常產量，可達一百萬張，估計今年可收七十萬張，外銷現貨約値每對四元左右，湖羊皮可收三十萬張，現價一元四五角。靑羊皮約一百萬張，每張約値一元二角，如時局好轉，交通恢復，則預計產量更可增加云。</p>
<h3>信用合作社支票將准予恢復使用</h3>
<p>關於財政部禁止信用合作社爲支票付款人一事，頃悉社會部已擬具理由書，意請行政院仍准信用合作社爲支票付款人。現該部爲加强管理城市信用合作社之業務，使其正常發展，眞正成爲平民之金融機構，已與財政部商訂城市信用合作社管理辦法草案一種，即可會同吳請行政院核定，公佈施行。該項辦法草案，對於城市信用合作社之設立，採許可制。凡城市信用合作社應經當地主管機關轉報社財兩部予以甄別。如有組織及業務不健全者，得予解散。其已核准登記尙未開業者，須重加審定後，始准開業。其餘關於信用合作肚社員之入社，業務種類，放款，款額，期限，利率，存款準備等，均有明確規定云。</p>
<h3>捲菸銷暢價漲</h3>
<p>昨日捲款於市面，初開平庸，旋以本街需求殷切，行情趨秀。至九時許，外埠同行拋售，價似疲軟，迨至午收，老刀烟因久未派貨，存底枯薄，買方吸納甚暢，做高至一千七百七十萬，比上日回漲卅萬元。大英烟軋升十萬元。半日趨勢，三砲台與白錫包行情距離較遠，實銷甚旺，臨收照牌加二千爲十五萬八，有人收進。此外廿支前門銀行牌買氣亦濃，市均堅昂，五十支聽裝烟到稀銷活，步升一·二千元。其他白蘭地雙斧紅金美麗等條烟，各好五百至千元不等。</p>
<h3>本年烟貸數目共二八〇億元</h3>
<p>本年菸貨，據四聯總處發表，計先後在皖豫兩省貸放菸葉生產貸款一百五十六億，加工貸款一百廿四億，共為二百八十億元。兩地菸農受惠植菸者違十萬戶。</p>
<h3>成都物價又漲</h3>
<p>〔本報成都十六日電〕平靜逾月之川物價，十五日又起漲風，十六日蓉廿雙紅雁紗每包二四九〇萬，美事陰丹士林每疋二一五萬，百貨均昂，糧食尙穩。原因傳受美貸過少，及豪門國積所致。省會警察局即組經濟檢査隊管制。</p>
<h3>六區造紙工業對木漿進口　籲請放寬限額　從五二萬擴充至一百萬元美金</h3>
<p>六區造紙工業公會向工商輔導處呼籲，要求放寬限額至一百萬美元，以挽該業危機。據稱：第一季木漿限額計四五萬美元，除資委會所屬各紙廠提去十萬美元，其他各區紙廠提留五萬美元外，該會區域各廠僅得三十萬元美元，爲數過少。第二三季則均爲五二萬五千美元，除他區紙廠七萬五千美元外，各廠實得四五萬美元，亦僅能輸入紙漿一千五六百噸，以供三個月需用，仍不數甚鉅。若依照目設備充份生產計之，每季實需木漿一五〇〇〇噸。今所獲者不過十份之一，各廠不能繼續生產，致陷於半停頓狀態，維持極度艱難。在前尙有紙邊破布，可資補充，但因各廠需要殷切，價格亦甚高昂。近復以戰事蔓延，各處交通阻絕，各廠生存乃大感恐慌。請將每季限額放寬為美金一百萬元，可以輸入三千餘噸，亦僅及實需之四分一，俾可苟延殘喘，挽救垂危之工業云。</p>
<h3>日本恢復對外貿易後　私人交易困難尙多　日貨價高質劣商人不敢輕辦</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕香港當局對於私人對外貿易，自從日本宣佈恢復對外貿易後，始終採扶植政策。當此政府美元極度困難中，各種外匯申請均限制極嚴，然對指定對日貿易之十餘家商號，每家均指定每月配給外匯額約二萬五千元，於此可見一斑。然日本貿易宣稱恢復，及今爲時將達三月。香港對日貿易，除政府能順利進行貨物交換外，私人貿易迄不正式恢復。據對日貿易有資格者實稱：對日貿易最大困難，莫如日貨價格之昂貴。目前日貨交易，係以美元爲單位。日本商人產品，雖係以日元作標準，售給盟軍當局，而盟軍當局對輸出計算，則係以美元根據世界各地貨價而決定。因此使若干日本原可輸出貨品，由於價格之過高，有意經營者，亦不願輕率下手。即以三百號90×100五百張一令之玻璃紙而論，日本價爲美金廿一元一角有多，較之目前歐洲方面訂價，亦不相上下。其次另一問題，目前港商進行對日私人貿易者，日本方面仍不准許設立分支行，因此貿易進行感受極大困難。蓋日本人信用較差，戰前固然，戰後其產品更劣。如數月前運抵香港之鬧鐘一批，即可爲例。故在日如無分支行設立，以便聯絡，而貿然訂貨者，港商實絕不放心。此外輸往日本貨物，在本港出口紙並無任何不便規定，惟日本方面對轍入貨品，則限制至嚴。大致二般可供再生產之原料，輸入尙無問題，但屬於消耗及不必需之貨品，則多列入限制輸入之列。至關係貿易前途發展甚大之交通運輸嬰題，目前港日間經常有太古怡和兩公司所屬船隻來往，貨物運輸，尙無大礙。祇兩地商務通訊困難尙多，目前由港可以拍發電報抵日，一但由日直接拍電來港，則無可能。航信自日可以付載美軍用機來港，而在港則因無民用機赴日，軍用機亦絕不飛往，故航信自港則無法投寄往日。由此上述數大嬰題，故港日間私人未來貿易，尙難樂觀。關於港常局與日進行物物交換以來，日貨運港，大宗者有棉紗布疋絨料時鐘等。由港輸往日本者，則以草蓆爲最多。此項草蓆，日本甚感需要，，用作日茶日絲及各種轍出品包裝之用云。</p>

<h3>用麻醉劑割治頸部（續）　病症發生意外之實例</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>此外吾人又復研究頸部主動脈（Arteria　carotica）之轉灣處亦復予人注意。據Heymans報吿，用化學品刺激狗之頸部主動脈而割斷其自動神經，則其呼吸亦突然中止。Heymans　氏會經詳細檢査此種反射作用之發生情形。從前吾人以爲血內養氣之缺乏與夫炭酸氣之增加乃爲刺激呼吸神經中樞發生作用之原動力，惟海曼氏已經證明此種作用之發生實由於頸部主動脈附近之一種反射作用所致。隨後有數位專家如HeymansEuler，Bouckaert，Dautrebande氏等又復證明頸部主動脈之轉灣處亦有此種反射作用。而所謂血內義氣缺乏之刺激作用實爲一種簡接之作用而已。蓋吾人若將頸部主動脈以及頸部主動脈轉灣處之反射原動力除去，則血內唱腔養氣之缺乏亦不足以刺激呼吸神經中樞發生呼吸作用，反之惟有阻止其呼吸作用而已。又如血內之炭酸氣增加時亦然。是以惟有頸部主動脈及其轉灣處之反射原動力（Chemreceptouen）存在時，其血內炭酸氣方始活潑運用也。　有一位Castro氏以為並非在頸部主動脈之轉灣處有反射作用，却在GlomusCarcticum（即在主動脈之分义處）方始有之。隨後海曼氏亦曾證明是處確有此種反射作用存在，而其轉灣處乃為血壓高低之調節機關也。此外在心臟底部以及心肌中層亦有此反射作用之出發點。</p>
<p>根據上述情形，吾人可以研究此種反射作用之出發點究竟與開刀時施行麻醉法所發生之意外有無關係。有Weese氏者曾經將此種問題詳加研究。彼以松節油注入於狗之頸部主動脈分又處附近，使之發生膿痬。此時彼注射普通份量之上述麻醉劑於靜脈內，結果竟無任何變化。由此可知，膿痬之本身並無任何足以引起反射作用發生之直接作用。然而若用上述份量之半數，而同時即以輕微之壓力壓抑於下巴角上，則其呼吸立即停止，雖用任何藥物亦不能使之回蘇。其最足奇異者則爲若以指壓抑其未生膿瘍之另一側，則絲毫不生變化。若於靜脈注射麻醉劑後稍延片刻約在五分鐘後，則雖在有膿痬之一側　之亦無上述之呼吸停止現象。總而言之，若於靜脈內注射麻醉劑後等待時章越長，則此種呼吸忽然停止之可能性越少。若將頸部主動脈之分又處完全割去，則亦無此種反射作用發生。此無他，反射作用之主要機關已被除去故也。根據上述事實看來，我人可以推論此種反射作用可以在麻醉時期中最後方始感受麻醉劑之影響而被抑制。申言之，其頸部主動脈分又處之神經單位在麻醉之初期中不易受麻醉劑之抑制，而尙能發生刺激呼吸停止之反射作用也。此稱假定雖則言之成理，然亦需要事實之證明耳。據Weese　氏意見，因此處之後咽地帶僅恃單獨之小動脈維持血液之管養，則遇膿瘍發生時固極易因血流之阻塞關係激動此處之神經單位發生一種阻止呼吸之反射作用也。吾人當然可以懷疑，何以必須有膿痬存在，方始有此種反射作用發生？此則大半因膿痬發生之後其反射作用之原動力則易於感受刺激，而其原有之抑制呼吸作用遂以此增强。設或麻醉繼續進行，病者感受更深之麻醉，則此時此地之反射作用神經單位亦感受麻醉不致於再有抑制呼吸現象而能照常呼吸矣惟其麻醉力發作越强，越快，則其反動力亦愈劇，此則爲不可不注意者（例如用Chioraetliy或Barbiturate之類）。</p>
<p>總而言之：所以搆成呼吸忽然停止之因素有三：　發炎性或化膿性之頸部病症，　麻醉力發作甚快之麻醉劑之短期急速輸進，　遇有一種機械性之局部刺激，（例如壓抑舌根，壓抑頸部，及下巴靈等待）。而上述之三種因素均已具備於上述之案件中，則病者之必死也明矣。吾人鑒於目前之不幸經騐，當然明悉頸部發炎性病症施行外科手術時用靜脈注射之麻醉劑乃爲最危險之舉動。如有他法可想，則須竭力避免之。徜或必須使用此法，則須萬分謹愼，注射時絕對緩慢，注射後尤須等待數分鐘後方可有其他舉動（例如壓抑舌根，放入壓舌器以及開刀之類）。而頸部主動脈分叉處之設法避免一切機械性之刺激，則尤爲必須注意者」。</p>
<p>俊靑按葛拉芙氏之報吿使吾人增加知識不少，蓋在外科手衛前之麻醉期中往往有病者忽然呼吸停止之意外事情發生，吾人不知其故，總以爲「特異質」之故，今茲據葛氏報吿，則知尙有許多複雜之因素有以促成之。南京錢明照醫師受控之案件或亦與此類似。但不知有人能爲之硏究其詳否？又上述之案件發生於瑞京，主持手術之醫帥未被控訴過失殺人。若此案在中國發生，則不知又鬧至如何地步矣。嗟乎，如此科學落後之國家，經過八年之抗戰，猶不思對於與國計民生有密切關係之衛生行政以及醫事　設有所更張耶？</p>

<h3>科學界兩大進展</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>科學界的領域一天天都在擴大，不久後恐怕又要有不少的新進股來繼續擴大它的範圍的。今年十月底是美國耶魯大學希費德科學院（Sheffield　Scientific　School）創辦百週年紀念，在這個紀念會上全美的科學界威都有精彩的講演，最値得注意的是兩個會獲諸貝爾獎金的科學家宣佈了他們那震撼學界的大發現。</p>
<p>物質的秘密</p>
<p>諾貝爾物理學獎金獲得者，迴轉衝擊器（Cyclotrons）的發明人勞倫斯（Ernest　O.Lawrence）宣稱他最近又建造成了一座重四千噸的同週期迴轉衝擊器（Synchro-cyclotron），並且已經發現了原十核中那神秘而强有力的「維繫力」（Bindin　g　force）的秘密。當這座同週期迴旋衝擊器建成後第一次在加利福加尼大學轉動時，從它的圓形的內室裏就有强力的射綫放出。這强力的射綫在滲過一呎厚的鉛板後尙保有半以上的强度，經過不少科學家的研究後才發現這束射綫（Beam）是由中子（Neutron，原子核內沒有電荷的質點），組成的，一但在　擊器內有雙質子（Deuteron重氫原子核）去衝擊靶子時，這些中子便被衝碎殘留下來。同時他們在勞倫斯領導下好像小孩子玩弄玩具似的整天搬弄，終而又證明這種中子射綫幾乎可以衝擊任何原子，摧毀任何放射性元素</p>
<p>我們知道所有的原子核（氫原子除外）都包含着兩個或兩個以上的質子（Proton），質子上都帶有正電荷，按理牠們應當互相排斥的很厲害，但却由一種神秘的維緊力來吸引着牠們，這維　力從那裏來的？若干年來成萬的科學家都在尋求它的解答，今天才算是眞相大白了。</p>
<p>遠在第二次大戰以前，德國諾貝爾物理獎金獲得者赫森堡博士（Dr.Werner　Heisenberg）曾用數學式子推論出一種解釋這種現象的學說來，他認爲原子核裏的質子和中子之間的電荷是很快的來回交換着，當一個質點得到電荷後就成爲質子，失去電荷後就成爲中子。由於這種「電荷交換」（Charge　exchange）現象才產生這種强大的維緊力。但是他始終無法來證明這種學說的正確與否。</p>
<p>現在，勞倫斯已經帮他證明了這學說，當高速的中子衝擊在電離過的衝擊器內壁上時，反躍回來的却是質子，他認爲這個跳回來的質子就是去面擊壁牆的中子。另外當一個中子和一質子靠的很近時，質子上的電荷就在二者之來回跳動，一但二者接觸，電荷立即到中子上去，使其變爲質子。假定這現象就是原子核中質子間的維　力的唯一解釋的話，這將是今日科學界一件極其偉力的新進展。</p>
<p>生命的秘密</p>
<p>在紀念典禮後第二天，洛氏醫藥硏究所Rockefeller　Institute　for　Midical　Reasearch）的史坦萊（Wendell　M.Stanley）又提出了一個富有爆炸性和玄妙性的問題：生命是什麼？</p>
<p>史坦萊博士是美國病菌研究的權威，又是諸貝爾化學獎金的獲得者，十二年前，他會發現了一個震撼學界的事實，就是某種病菌（Virus）（使菸草得斑限病的病菌）是「又生又死」（Both　living　and　dead）的。牠可以像有生命的有機生物一樣的來生殖，同時又像無機的化學物品一樣結成結晶體。這個新發展立即引起了廣大的注意，成千的科學家立即向着這塊新領域去開拓了，新近史博士綜合了一些關於這種半生半死的微小東西的研究材料，使他足然對生命的解釋上有了新進展。</p>
<p>這種非常微小的病菌在普通的顯微鏡下是看不出的，但放在電子顯微鏡下則可以看的很淸楚。使菸草得斑駁病（Tobaccomosdic）的病菌是微小的桿狀，這羣桿狀病菌分散在很遠的距離外尙能互相作用，活像一根根小磁　互相作用一樣。他雖然無法解釋這「長距離作用力」（Long-Range　force），但從此對生物的生命又有新的認識。他和他的助手們曾用一串「化學過程」（Chemical　Process）這病菌「停止活動」（實際就是死），再顚倒這化學過程使牠又復活。由此看將來未嘗不可用某種化學過程把人類放在試騐管中讓他死去，再把他復活起來。</p>
<p>這些病菌大半含有蛋白質和氨基酸（Amino　acid），用精密的化學方法可以增加或減少牠們體內的氨基酸，就可使活耀的病菌變成萎靡，溫和的病菌變成惡毒的毒質。並且他們發現一經改變牠們的體質，也就永遠改變了牠的子孫後代。由是史坦萊博士預測這對人類的生命有極大的關連，因為人類的這傳因基（細胞內一種小質點可以控制人類的遺傳）和病菌是很像的，很可能只要少要改變一下因基內的氨基酸數量，就可使遺傳大大改變。這樣設來，人類如果改良了它的因基就可控制着人類自己的進化了嗎？博士說：「是的，這是可以……不過關於這種知識多少對自以爲高超的人類的自尊心上是有點損傷的。」</p>
<p>這是南極的企鵝，性良善，閒靜有緻直立如人形，幼時毛全黑，長大後胸毛白，背毛黑，一生只生二卵，在冰天雪地孵育成雛，居然亦能續種，自然界亦奇妙矣。（熙）</p>
<h3>食鹽與人生</h3>
<p>— 皮爾</p>
<p>食鹽是我們天天見到的，是一種方形的結晶體，它不像飯那般的每餐不可缺少，但也不像糖菓那般的可以隨便不吃，它也是非吃不可的，但偶而可以缺一兩餐的。如果經常的缺少，那末人體就漸漸的感到不計服，頸就漸漸的粗腫起來，那是甲狀腺腫賬，於是精神就頽唐下去，其他疾病也就連着來了！在人體的組織上，食鹽的成份就很多多，你看血，肌肉，汗，尿都帶鹹味。</p>
<p>但食鹽本身是氯和鈉兩種原素組成的。單體的氣氣是很毒的，當然不要得，單體的納也不能吃，因爲它的化學性極强，如果你把鈉投入水中它就起劇烈的化學變化，變成氫氧化鈉與放出氫氣，同時發高熱，甚至於暴炸，但是把鈉和氫化合起來變成食鹽，却是一種有鹹味的好東西，很多美味是靠着它的。</p>
<p>人需要它，任何動物都需要它，那末它不是會像煤一樣將要被用完嗎？却不會的，它在自然界有的是，那汪洋無際的大海洋裏，百分之三是食鹽，在大陸上也有岩鹽，而且食鹽對於動物可以說是循環的，吃進去是那麽多，排洩出來的也還是那麼多，大一點的循環來說，動物的生死就是食鹽的一次較大的循環，所以是絕對用不完的。</p>
<p>最奇怪是自然界配合的玄妙，自然界蘊藏得多的不是單體鈉與單體氣，因爲鈉是不能單獨存在的，但也不是鈉與氯的其他化合物，却是他們自己的化合物食鹽，固然我們也可以從氣鈉的其他化合物中製取食鹽，但是到底麻煩，決不如拿海水來晒乾那麼方便，再拿食鹽的性質來說，是與氯化鉀差不多的，和氯化鎂也差不了多少，但自然界蘊藏的不是大量的氣化鉀或氯化鎂，因爲氯化鉀是沒有味道的，氯化鎂更是苦得不能入口，只有美味的食鹽，特別給人方便，食鹽就溶在海水裏，要用隨時可取。固然，氯化鉀與氯化鎂可以代替食鹽，但是如果把地球上的食鹽換作氯化鎂或氣化鉀，那人們就要减少許多的口福。</p>
<h3>海中新寶藏</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉麟</p>
<p>海洋中生長着許多的海藻，這些蓀色的，棕色的植物除了餵牛外，並無多大用處，在沿海一帶反而是一種航行的障礙。英國的科學家在這次大戰中却看中了它，把海藻的身價頓時抬高。</p>
<p>利用海藻可以製成許多代用品，光澤如絲的內衣，衫襪，紙張，化粧品，橡皮，傢具，可塑體（Plastics）等許多物品，用途廣泛得說不盡。</p>
<p>經過長期的辛苦硏究，科學家在海藻中提出Alginic　Acid，此物一經煉製，可得光亮的人造絲，堅靸耐用，織成布疋，可以染色，與棉紗並無遜色，而其優點則爲防水耐火，即使浸以火油而以火燃燒，油盡而此物完好不損。</p>
<p>由此新的工業即將發展了，因爲海藻是取之不盡，用之不竭的。浩淼無際的狂洋變成了豐富的原料生產地。試想，單就Sargaso　Sea的面積二百五十萬哩來說，已經超過了全地球所有的小麥田了。採集千萬噸是不成問題的。</p>
<p>除了工業外，在農業上海藻也有了新用途，因為其中含有多量的鉀實，正是植物不可缺的肥料，所以現在蘇格蘭和愛爾蘭已經大量施用此項海藻肥料了。大戰使英國知道了海藻的妙處，這些廉價而無限的原料，必然要日益重要起來的了。</p>
<p>這個美麗的苔蘚虫，負有羣生，堪以入畫。（熙）</p>
<h3>原子會改變嗎？</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>只要稍微有些科學知識的人，都知道原子是可以改變的，不是嗎？假使原子不能改變的話，原子炸彈根本就不可能發明了，因爲原子彈就是利用鈾的分裂特性，用一個中子去衝擎鈾原子，於是就使鈾原子發生連鎖反應，每個鈾分裂出三個中子，放出大量的潛伏能，而太身改變成其他的元素，這就是原子能够改變的一個最顯明的例子。</p>
<p>可是，我們翻開化學書籍來一看，最基本的道爾頓原子論（Dalton's　Atomic　Theory）這樣說：原子是構成物質最小的粒子；組成同樣化合物的相同原子，其形狀，重量必等；無論何種原子不能加以分裂，創造和破壊。</p>
<p>事實上，我們知道這三點都錯誤的：第一點，原子並不是構成物質的最小粒子，根據現代的科學知識，我們知道電子，質子和中子才是最小的粒子。第二點，相同原子的形狀與重量未必一定相等，因為同位元素（Isotopes）是一個證明，就以鈾作例子，它的同位元素就有鈾二三八和鈾二三四等，如果沒有同位元素存在的話，那麽原子量也不會有小數點後的數字了。</p>
<p>至於第三點，更値得我們作爲討論的重心，原子是絕對可以分裂，創造和破壞的，這也就是我們發現新元素的立脚點，我不妨仍把鈾作例子，看它分裂，創造和破壊的特性：</p>
<p>鈾二三八能够失去一個Alfa質點而變成鈾二三四；再失去一個Alfa質點變成　元素；也可能失去第二個Alfa質點而成鐳（Radium），鐳的半　期很長，約一六九〇年，可便鐳放射Alfa質點盡而本身全成爲一種鐳的射氣（稀有氣體之一），名之Radon；同時，Redon仍可以繼續不斷的放出Alfa與B質點而變成鉛。道一個放射性元素的分裂破壊和創造其他元素的過程，固然需要一個極長的時間，但是，如果有設備完全的實騐室，我們不難立刻看出這種特性。</p>
<p>科學是不斷演進的，日新月異的，處世在二十世紀原子時代的人們，應該知道一八〇四年的道爾頓原子論是不盡正確的。</p>

<p>紅外錢和紫外綫都是不能看見的，因爲紅外綫的輻射波太長，紫外綫的輻射波太短，所以人目都不起視覺。但是在科學不斷進步的今日，聰明的科學家却使它變成可見的東西。第二次世界大戰的未期，美國科學家終於利用紅外綫而發明了二種新型武器，這種新型武器可以適用於夜間的戰鬥，就是夜襲鏡和夜望鏡。據說在美軍攻擊硫磺島時，即已應用這種武器，在黑暗中予敵軍以重大的損害，這種武器係藉紅外綫的作用而發射電子，電子復通過電子透鏡而集於螢光屛上，因而顯像，這完全是電子學上的一種發明。但是最近經美國通用電氣實騐所中幾位專家的研究，似乎是更進步了，據說把一小塊鉛加人硫化鋅內，則經曝光後，能使不可見的紅外綫變成可見這個發明，可使夜襲鏡和夜望鏡的裝置，均將趨於簡單</p>
<p>若以紅外綫當作信號，他人不能望見，而具有特殊裝置者則可收得之在道次世界大戰中，製學袖珍主力艦「竇畢資」號及另一日本主力艦之小型潛水艇，一九四四年九月擊沉挪威貝爾根港巨型浮動船塢之役，切斷太平洋海底電綫之活動，以及北菲登陸戰時均會使用過。此外如地下工作人士之秘密活動，盟伴之脫逃，以及夜渡萊茵河之役等，均會藉紅外錢之指示。空軍之夜間戰鬥，亦藉紅外綫爲信號，在兩棲戰中，紅外錢更爲海陸空間最神妙之連絡。自動武器配有紅外錢自動瞄準器者亦已發明，但因戰事結束過早，尙未正式使用於戰塲。</p>
<p>還有一種能發聲的電燈，也是利用紅外綫而造成的，這個利用紅外錢通信的方法，在大戰期內原已由德國和日本先後應用於戰爭中，不過這種方法不能用於長距離，但是十哩左右的節圍以內，不能裝設軍用電話，亦不能用無錢電話時，這種利用紅外錢通信方法却可適用，只是他們的通信裝置中並沒有用到銫。後來美國的皮斯（Beese）博士設計，才知道這種　金屬是效率很高的紅外綫波發生劑，而同時是一種不良的發光體，因此可不需用濾光裝置，而信號則不致爲人所見，據說這種利用銫的銫蒸氣燈，在戰時雖沒有完成，但不久就要出現了</p>
<p>總之，科學的進步是無止境的，只要我們能够迎頭趕上，努力硏究，就會發明更巧妙，更有用的東西來。</p>

<h3>Great Victory of the National Army Outside Yulin: Peng's Seven Brigades Completely Annihilated; Fu Zuoyi Sends Special Telegram to Ma Hongda to Congratulate</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 16th] The Yulin defense battle, after two months of hard fighting, has once again achieved a great victory. The bandits mobilized forces of up to ten brigades, totaling thirty regiments, while the defending troops had only three regiments and were inferior in weaponry. Nevertheless, they were ultimately able to overcome the enemy and achieve victory. The bandits once used intense artillery fire to break through the city walls and infiltrate the city, but they were all annihilated and driven back, turning danger into safety. The bandits, having suffered this severe blow, will inevitably be unable to recover and will find it difficult to run rampant again.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhangjiakou, 16th] Military News: The brave Ningxia troops of infantry and cavalry, sent to aid Yulin, attracted the main force of the communist bandits in the Liangjiutan area, fifty li northwest of Yulin, and fought fiercely for two days and nights, achieving a complete victory. Peng Dehuai, in a desperate gamble, personally led seven brigades to intercept the supporting troops, but they were crushed and annihilated, and it is possible that Peng himself was captured. On the night of the 14th, the battle reached its climax. The bandits once broke through the National Army's positions, but after the officers and soldiers bravely resisted, using broadswords, bayonets, shovels, picks, and engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, the intensity was unprecedented. Repeatedly charging and counter-charging, they lost and regained ground several times. By dawn on the 15th, the bandits were completely routed, and the National Army is now dividing its forces to pursue and annihilate them. General Deng Binshan personally led mechanized units from Zhasak Banner to Liangjiutan to provide support. The Yulin defending forces also launched a flanking attack from the rear of the bandits, forming a three-sided encirclement, completing the encirclement, and launching a large-scale annihilation battle. The main force of the bandit army, seven brigades in total, was completely annihilated, no longer able to form an army, and is about to be completely wiped out.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] When news of the victory at Liangjiutan in Yulin arrived, people here were extremely excited. Fu Zuoyi, Director of the Zhangyuan Pacification Headquarters, sent a telegram to Ma Hongkui, Chairman of Ningxia, congratulating him, pointing out that this battle not only laid the foundation for northern Shaanxi, but also reversed the overall situation in the Northwest. Also, Deng Binshan sent a telegram to Zhangjiakou, reporting the great victory at Yulin, praising the success of Director Fu's strategic plan.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] Fu Zuoyi flew from Zhangjiakou this afternoon to Ping, to meet with Director Li of the Executive Headquarters, to report on the course of the Yulin relief.</p>
<h3>The Army and People of Yuncheng Firmly Defend the Isolated City</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 16th] The army and people of Yuncheng have fought hard for thirty-five days and nights and, as of the 15th, are still firmly defending the city. At present, the fighting is most intense in the southeast and northeast of the city. Although the bandits have repeatedly attacked the vocational school in the west of the city and the Chishen Temple and Yubao in the southwest, they have all been repelled.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 16th] The National Army recovered Xiangling on the 11th. Bandits in the Zhaocheng area have infiltrated near Linfen, showing signs of attacking Lincheng again. After the National Army captured Maojindu and Pinglu County, the army and people of Yuncheng were encouraged. The bandits attacking Yuncheng used coffins to carry bombs, attempting to use tunnels to destroy the city defenses, but the defending troops are taking strict precautions.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Xuzhou is Extremely Stable; Communist Bandits in the Suburbs are Continuously Being Repelled; The National Army in Henan Recaptures Nanzhao City</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 16th] On the night of the 15th, National Army reinforcements arrived and repelled the communist bandits outside Xuzhou, and the city of Xu is peaceful. After Gu Zhutong flew to Nanjing a few days ago to meet with Chairman Jiang to request instructions, he returned to Xu by way of Nanjing at 2 PM on the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 16th] The situation around Xuzhou is largely stable. Although the bandits who infiltrated the suburbs of the city from Yanglou, 28 li southwest of the city, and the Erbao, Sanbao, and Gaojiaying areas along the Jinpu Railway, are still coming on fiercely, and several shells even landed in the urban area for a time, the situation has eased from today onwards. The National Army, after reinforcements and with the assistance of the air force, has gradually repelled the invading bandits. The fighting is still continuing.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The National Army is gathering in Xuzhou and advancing on the bandits in several directions. They routed the remnants of the 4th Column of the bandits along the Old Yellow River line. Another National Army unit, attacking from Jiagou in Feng County, has reached its designated location, and a decisive annihilation battle is about to begin. The 11th Column of the bandit army, which was defeated northwest of Xuzhou, was intercepted again by the Tongshan Security Regiment near Wugangji on the north bank of the Old Yellow River on the evening of the 15th, and a fierce battle immediately broke out. The bandits suffered heavy losses and were unable to escape south. On the 16th, they turned back to the Liuji Liuxingzhuang area and were again blocked by a National Army unit. The fighting is still fierce.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 16th] After part of Liu's 11th Column was defeated by the National Army at Liuji, northwest of Xuzhou, on the 14th, it fled towards Jinganji. Part of Chen's 1st Column infiltrated Yaolou (15 kilometers southwest of Xuzhou), and the National Army is blocking them, and fierce fighting is underway.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 16th] The fighting north of Caocun on the Jinpu Railway was quiet on the 16th, with only some contact at dawn. National Army reinforcements are continuously moving forward to Qianqian, and are advancing in search. Military trains heading north can reach Fuliji. Military trains north and south of the Suxian station are moving in an endless stream, and mechanized units are also participating in the battle. Only one special express train runs between Bengbu and Pukou each day.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Kaifeng, 15th] The bandits who had infiltrated and occupied Nanzhao in southwestern Henan were unable to withstand the fierce attack by a strong unit of the National Army yesterday afternoon and collapsed, scattering into the Funiu Mountain area. The National Army recovered Nanzhao County at 12 noon yesterday.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Shouguang, Shandong; Large Forces Gather in Gaomi</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 16th] After three days and nights of fierce fighting in Shouguang, National Army reinforcements arrived on the 16th, and the situation has turned stable. For the past two days, the air force has repeatedly dispatched planes to participate in the battle in Shouguang, greatly boosting the morale of the defending troops and killing many bandits. The fighting was most intense on the night of the 15th. By the morning of the 16th, part of the communist bandits had retreated, while another part continued to attack the city. The retreating bandits encountered the National Army near Sunjiaji, and fierce fighting continues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 16th] Another major battle is brewing near Gaomi. The entire 2nd, 9th, and 7th Columns and the 10th Division of the 4th Column of the bandits infiltrated the outskirts of Gaomi on the 15th and engaged in fierce fighting with the forward units of the National Army. Currently, large forces of the National Army are gathering in Gaomi. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the National Army in Haiyang continued to attack the bandits on the 15th, annihilating about a regiment of the 13th Column of the bandits and capturing more than ten important villages and strongholds.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Asks for Replenishment of Weapons and Ammunition to Strengthen Local Armed Forces; Approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 16th] Political News: The Jiangsu Provincial Government submitted a proposal at the Six-Province Joint Defense Conference: In order to strengthen the local armed forces in northern and southern Jiangsu, it is necessary to replenish a large number of weapons and ammunition. This has been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of National Defense. It is reported that the quantity of light and heavy weapons and ammunition approved for initial distribution is sufficient to equip civilian self-defense forces equivalent to ten security regiments. However, the organization and training of self-defense forces in various counties of this province must also be strengthened in the future.</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Offices to Operate in Three Locations</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 16th] In order to cooperate with military operations, the Hebei Provincial Government will operate in three locations: Fengtai, Beiping, and Baoding. The Departments of Education and Finance, as well as the Social Affairs and Accounting Offices, have decided to operate in Tieshizi Hutong in Beiping, while the remaining departments and offices will operate in Fengtai. A portion of the personnel will remain in Baoding, under the charge of He Jingxin, Director of the Education Department.</p>
<h3>Shangguan Yunxiang Returns to Ping</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 16th] Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, returned to Ping today from Nanjing. It is said that Chairman Jiang is very concerned about the current situation in the North, and that weapons and ammunition can be supplied in large quantities, so the situation in the North is expected to see a new phase unfold.</p>
<h3>All Circles in Baoding Call for the Swift Dispatch of Senior Officials to Take Charge</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 16th] Various legal bodies and the Qingyuan County Council in Hebei Province, due to the fall of Shimen and the continuous movement of Hebei Provincial Government officials to Ping, have caused unrest in Baoding. On the 16th, they jointly sent telegrams to the Chairman and the Executive Yuan, requesting the swift dispatch of large numbers of troops and senior officials to Baoding to reassure the people. Furthermore, the Baoding University Association also sent a telegram to the Central Government and a telegram requesting Chairman Sun Suzhong to swiftly return to Baoding with the provincial committee members to take charge.</p>
<h3>Britain Raises Objections to Parts of Foreign Exchange; Sino-Hong Kong Agreement Awaits Further Negotiations; New Anti-Smuggling Measures Implemented Since Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 16th] The reason why the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement has not yet been announced, according to reliable information, is that after the foreign exchange and trade sections of the agreement were agreed upon, the British side temporarily raised objections to the handling of public commissions and overseas remittances in Hong Kong, causing the agreement to be shelved again. It is now reported that the authorities have dispatched Foreign Advisor Rogers of the Ministry of Finance and Yu Renjie, a member of the Exchange Equalization Fund, to Hong Kong to conduct decisive negotiations with the British side.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 15th] The Sino-Hong Kong joint anti-smuggling measures were decided to be implemented from the 15th. From now on, any goods transported from Hong Kong to Chinese ports must have their manifests certified by the Hong Kong authorities, otherwise they will be treated as smuggled goods. However, this does not apply to goods carried on the same ship that are transported to China from elsewhere or unloaded in Hong Kong and transported to other foreign ports.</p>
<h3>New Director of the Guangzhou Executive Headquarters, Song Ziwen, Takes Office Today; The Guangdong-Guangxi Security Conference Opens Simultaneously</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 16th] Zhang Fakui, Director of the Guangzhou Executive Headquarters, has been transferred to the Strategic Advisory Committee, and Song Ziwen has been appointed to succeed him. It is reported that the two will formally hand over on the 17th. It is said that Zhang Fakui will fly to Nanjing at the end of the month to assume his new post, and then quickly return to eastern Guangdong to engage in agricultural reclamation work. The city of Guangzhou is preparing to hold a grand welcoming and farewell gathering on the 17th. Public opinion here has given positive reviews to Song's assumption of the Executive Headquarters, recognizing it as the beginning of a civilian leading military and political affairs. Based on Song's past achievements in managing the Tax Police Corps, he will surely have a good performance.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 16th] The Guangdong-Guangxi Security Conference was originally scheduled to be held in Guangzhou on the 16th, presided over by Director Zhang. However, due to Director Zhang's inability to fly to Guangzhou, it was specially rescheduled to open on the 17th, and will be presided over by Song Ziwen, lasting for two days. In addition, the Guangzhou Executive Headquarters has recently announced that all Communist Party members under its jurisdiction must report to their respective governments by the end of the year for a fresh start, otherwise they will be severely punished as bandit military spies.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Transfers Two Regiments of Troops to Hainan Island to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Guangzhou, 15th] Bandits are rampant on Hainan Island. Chairman Song discussed with the Ministry of National Defense during his recent visit to Nanjing the transfer of two regiments of the National Army to Qiong to suppress them. This has been approved, and one regiment of a certain army and another reserve regiment have been transferred to Qiongya, specifically responsible for suppression. Furthermore, after the large-scale encirclement and suppression of the Lu Neng gang in southern Guangdong, a portion of them recently fled to sea on six large junks, attempting to land on Hainan Island. They were discovered by naval gunboats and pursued, and three bandit ships were sunk, with heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Bandit Forces in the Northeast Disintegrating; Shenyang Gradually Returning to Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] The sixth offensive by the bandits in the Northeast has collapsed, and the traffic in the Shenyang area will be restored within days. At the same time, with the recovery of Dashiqiao, the traffic between Shenyang and Yingkou is also expected to open. Prices here are gradually falling, and the southern area has entered a state of peace.</p>
<h3>Banditry Completely Cleared on the Eastern, Northern, and Southern Sides of Changchun</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The banditry in the outer strongholds of Mishazi and Kalun, to the north and east of Changchun, has been completely cleared.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The main forces of the Third and Fourth Columns of the bandits and the Independent First and Second Divisions in eastern Manchuria are currently entrenched south of Yitong and east of Shuangyang for reorganization. The scattered remnants of the bandit forces, such as the main forces of the First, Second, and Sixth Columns, have now infiltrated into the territory of Huaide County, west of the Middle Chang Railway, shivering in the frigid snowy plains of minus twenty degrees Celsius. Tens of thousands of bandit soldiers' cold-proof leather clothing is still far from the supply line, thousands of miles away. Currently, the bandit army along the Jichang Railway, fearing a pincer attack by the National Army from the east and west, has begun moving south in recent days.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Order the Japanese Government to Concentrate Wartime Loot; Invite Representatives from Various Countries to Visit in Stages</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] According to those in charge of the Reparations Committee, the Allied Headquarters have ordered the Japanese government to concentrate materials looted from various countries during the war in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, Nagoya, Hokkaido, and Otaru, and to invite representatives from various countries to visit in stages. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>Archbishop Yu Bin Speaks in the United States: China is Fighting for Democracy; Currency Inflation is the Main Reason</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] Archbishop Yu Bin reported to the Board of Directors of the Washington Chinese Cultural Society on the 15th, saying that China is fighting for democracy to resist the communist bandits. The communist bandits are equipped by the Soviet army and partly commanded by Soviet officers. China is not in a civil war, but a life-and-death battle against communism. This is the beginning of the Soviet Union's launch of an international anti-democratic war. If the Chinese Communists attempt to build an independent sovereign state in the Northeast, World War III will begin. Therefore, calling the war in China a civil war is only half true. Chinese communism is the same as communism everywhere else, and is commanded by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Archbishop Yu Bin said on the 15th that China's anti-communist war is the main reason for currency inflation. Currency inflation has bankrupted the Chinese economy and encouraged inefficiency and corruption. Archbishop Yu Bin said that during this visit to the United States, he learned that Americans criticized the Chinese National Government as undemocratic, fascist, and illiberal, but he attacked these views, believing that the Communist Party often calls its opponents fascists. He said that the Soviet Communist Party-led "International Brigade," which includes Korean, Mongolian, and Japanese troops and Soviet officers, is currently fighting in the Northeast, and constitutes one-third of the communist troops in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>American Parties Concerned About the Situation in China; Attitudes Towards Aid Vary in Urgency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] When the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the US Senate and the House of Representatives heard reports on the aid to Europe plan this week, the China issue was suddenly raised for discussion, leading to a question: which party, Republican or Democratic, is more interested in including the China issue in the current emergency plan? To date, Republican members of Congress and political figures have taken the lead over Democrats in advocating aid to China, led by Senate Speaker and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Vandenberg, and including Taft, Brewster, Smith, Judd, and Fulton. House Republican Speaker Martin is also strongly advocating immediate support for China, and another important Republican figure, New York Governor Dewey, has also recently strongly advocated aid to China. During a week of discussions in Congress, only Representative Kee of West Virginia mentioned the issue of aid to China. Kee only mentioned the matter incidentally, asking Secretary Marshall to compare the emergency aid from the United States to Western Europe with aid to China. Marshall never spontaneously discusses the policies of the State Department, and only reluctantly announces them under pressure. He estimates that 300 million US dollars is needed to curb the current currency inflation in China. The current question is why the Republican Party has expressed its opinion on aid to China far more urgently than the Democratic Party, and the Republicans can be divided into three factions: one is Judd and others with similar views, who believe that the crisis in China is at least as urgent as that in Western European countries, if not more so. They want to include China in the emergency aid plan. Marshall believes that although the situation in China is serious, it can wait a while, so it can be delayed until the aid to Europe plan takes effect. Marshall has always acknowledged that the United States must aid China, and this week he claimed that aid is very difficult, and a satisfactory solution has not yet been found. The second faction is Vandenberg and other Republicans, who believe that the aid to China issue must be included in the US world plan. They do not want to force the aid to China issue into the emergency aid plan, nor do they insist on reaching a decision in a special Congress. The third faction believes that aid to China is purely a political issue. The leaders of this faction are Dewey and Taft. They are not too eager for large loans to aid China, but they attack Truman and the State Department for not including the China issue as part of the overall world situation. According to some people, if a proper plan for aid to China cannot be established in Congress in January next year, then aid to China will become one of the major political issues in the presidential election, which Truman wants to avoid. But currently, the Republican Party is undoubtedly gathering capital for the general election on this issue. Other observers believe that the Democratic Party is equally concerned about the China issue, but is being too cautious because it has not yet decided how to proceed. It is said that Democratic leaders will wait for Truman and Marshall's decisions before beginning the work of aiding China. It is widely believed that the Democratic Party does not want to talk about aid to China at this time, also for political reasons. Some speculate that the Democratic Party wants the Republican Party to first propose a proposal for aid to China, because if the Democratic Party formulates a complete foreign aid plan, the burden on American taxpayers will be too heavy, and it will be easier to obtain funds in Congress when the Republican Party proposes it. According to a Democratic observer, the current arguments to include the issue of aid to China in the emergency relief plan are an attempt to induce Marshall to publish the Wedemeyer Report.</p>
<h3>Legislative Elections Begin; Three Parties to Confer Today on the Number of Candidates; National Assembly Meeting Date May Be Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The legislative elections are about to begin, but the allocation of quotas for the three parties has not yet been decided. It is reported that the Kuomintang has scheduled a meeting on the afternoon of the 17th to invite representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to confer, and a solution may be decided. It is known that the Youth Party hopes for a quota of 120 seats, and the Democratic Socialist Party hopes for a quota of 160 seats, but this is still subject to consultation and decision. The Standing Committee of the Kuomintang has scheduled an extraordinary meeting for the morning of the 17th to discuss and review the methods for the list of candidates for the Legislative Yuan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] A certain senior official recently told reporters that the general election will be held as scheduled, but the date of the National Assembly meeting may be postponed due to factual issues. There are two ways to postpone it: one is to hold the opening ceremony and then adjourn the meeting for several days before holding the meeting again; the other is to decide the date of the meeting by issuing a summons, as in the past year.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Holding a general election in China, no matter when, is not an easy task, because a nationwide election has never been held. The fierce civil war, currency inflation, and transportation difficulties make the election of 3,024 representatives to the National Assembly from November 21 to 23 all the more difficult. The government originally planned to print 150 million ballots in the central region, but due to transportation difficulties, distribution is not easy, and it has to be printed in separate regions, and the malpractices are predictable. It is estimated that seven out of ten voters are illiterate, so the secret election stipulated by the constitution is almost impossible. The government has hired thousands of ballot writers, and students from all over the country will be mobilized to assist at that time. There are no candidates' names on the ballots, and the list will be posted in large format everywhere, but the voters are illiterate, making it difficult to maintain secrecy. There is no campaign movement nationwide, and there is only competition between the party headquarters in Nanjing. There is no sign of an upcoming election elsewhere. Some neutral observers believe that China's election not only does not help the cause of democracy, but also harms it, because this is not the time. Opponents say that everything must have a beginning, and even an imperfect election is better than nothing. Both sides have reasons, but Chairman Jiang is determined to enable China to hold an unprecedented general election from November 21 to 23 to achieve democracy.</p>
<h3>Dai Chuanxian, Hu Zongnan, and Others Give Up National Assembly Candidate Status</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Director Dai recently sent a letter to Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, and others, asking them to report to the Central Committee on his behalf, requesting the withdrawal of his nomination as a candidate for the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Ms. Ma Peizhang, wife of Bai Chongxi, was previously publicly recommended by the Nanjing Islamic Association as a candidate for the National Assembly, but after Ms. Ma's repeated firm refusals, and after approval by the Election Guidance Committee, the Islamic Association has specially telegraphed the branch associations in various provinces to note this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 16th] Hu Zongnan, Director of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, was previously nominated as a candidate for the National Assembly from his ancestral home of Xiaofeng, Zhejiang. Hu said that at this time when the fighting against the bandits is tense, he has no time to participate, and has submitted a request to the Central Committee to give up his candidacy. In addition, Shaanxi Chairman Zhu Shaozhou, also due to busy official duties, has telegraphed the Hangzhou City Party Department, wishing to give up his nomination as a candidate for the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] According to reliable sources today, a total of 35 people from the Kuomintang side have voluntarily given up their qualifications as candidates for the National Assembly, all of whom are senior military officers. Chen Cheng and Yu Zhutong are also among them. This is the result of Chairman Jiang's persuasion last week.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th] The election work for the Shanxi Provincial Supervisory Committee has begun. This morning, the Provincial Assembly held an election meeting, and Li Jiang, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, represented Yan Xishan and attended the meeting to explain the proceedings. It is scheduled to complete the nomination of candidates on the 19th, hold a vote on the 22nd, and announce the list of elected candidates on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 16th] With the election of the National Assembly approaching, the Wuxian Election Office announced yesterday the list of administrators and supervisors for the polling places, and scheduled a meeting tomorrow to convene the heads of various vocational groups and candidates to discuss the procedures.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Restrict Japan's Industrial Standards?</h3>
<p>The Asian Regional Preparatory Conference of the International Labour Organization concluded in New Delhi on the 10th. The conference passed an important proposal by our country's representatives to determine Japan's industrial standards and oppose dumping; however, the details of the original proposal have not yet been published in the newspapers. Regarding the issue of determining Japan's industrial standards, that is, the issue of restricting Japan's industrial standards, various countries had already put forward plans, but our country's counter-proposal is still lacking. It is reported that the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are actively collecting materials and conducting detailed research. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has also sent the Director of the Industrial Affairs Department to Shanghai to solicit opinions from the Shanghai industrial community and seek opinions from the public. The Shanghai industrial and commercial community is also actively contributing to this effort. This shows that the issue of restricting Japan's industrial standards has become a matter of extreme concern to our country, both government and public. If our country cannot put forward a correct counter-proposal, the victory won on the battlefield for eight years will inevitably be defeated on a piece of peace treaty paper. Therefore, it is said that how to restrict Japan's industrial standards should be a matter of deep concern to both government and public.</p>
<p>Regarding how to restrict Japan's industrial standards, in terms of theory and technology, it is necessary to first determine how to preserve Japan's living standards. The so-called industrial standards and living standards are certainly completely different: this is a difference in nature, not a difference in interrelationship. The living standards of a country's people should be the sum of all industrial equipment and its productivity. If the people's livelihood of a country needs industry to maintain it, then industrial standards are one of the factors determining its living standards: but it is by no means to say that living standards are completely determined by industrial standards. The reason for this is, firstly, because living necessities are not all produced by industry, especially in so-called agricultural countries; secondly, because industrial products are not all necessary for maintaining the lives of their people, especially military industrial products. Therefore, when discussing restricting Japan's industrial standards, it is necessary to calculate and first determine the living standards to be preserved for a certain year, and then determine the industrial standards that should be retained, which would be more reasonable.</p>
<p>According to which criteria should the living standards of the Japanese people be determined? Article 11 of the Potsdam Declaration stipulates: "Japan shall maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war." The "economy" that is "to be sustained" here, according to the interpretation of the U.S. Preliminary Post-Surrender Policy for Japan on September 26, 1945, is a "peaceful Japanese economy"; according to the statement of U.S. President's Special Envoy for Reparations Edwin W. Pauley, it is "the lowest possible minimum useful Japanese economy." This minimum peaceful economy is the living standard that Japan is to maintain. Pauley also explained: "Not higher than the living standards of the countries Japan has invaded." This means that Japan's living standards should not be higher than those of other Asian countries. Based on this theory, Pauley released his Japanese reparations plan on December 7, 1945. According to Pauley, the Japanese industrial standards represented by this plan are based on Japan's living standards from 1926 to 1930. However, U.S. officials disagreed with Pauley's plan; unexpectedly, this April, the Far Eastern Commission unexpectedly passed the Strike Plan, "retaining the industries necessary to maintain its 1930-1934 living standards, and not completely dismantling them for reparations." Strike is a core figure in the anti-reparations theory, and his claims are naturally different from Pauley's. His claims naturally condone Japan and are detrimental to the Allies; therefore, Chinese public opinion opposes the Far Eastern Commission's decision most strongly. Judging from the current public opinion of various countries, the Far Eastern Commission's blueprint will hardly be established in the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>China has the right to express its opinions on this issue. Now that the world is focusing on the economic clauses of the peace treaty with Japan, it is time for us to put forward a counter-proposal. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie has returned from the United States and Japan and has made many speeches on the peace treaty with Japan, focusing only on procedural issues and arguing about whether the Soviet Union should participate, but in essence, he avoids discussing economic clauses; only the Political Consultative Conference and civil organizations, as well as industrial communities in various places, are truly paying attention to this issue. When the Asian Regional Preparatory Conference of the International Labour Organization was held, our representative Wu Yunfu put forward the issue of determining Japan's industrial standards, which immediately received enthusiastic support from Asian countries, especially indicating that this issue is related to the survival of the people of all Asian countries and the life of the industry of all Asian countries, and it must not be ambiguous, followed, and allowed to pass. Now the Executive Yuan's Reparations Committee and the Ministry of Economic Affairs are paying attention to this issue and are humbly seeking opinions from all parties, which is a very important measure, but unfortunately, our diplomatic authorities do not seem to pay much attention to it. We would like to provide two opinions on this issue:</p>
<p>(1) In accordance with the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration, Japan's economy should be maintained as an economy for peaceful living. What year and period should be used as the baseline for the required living standards cannot be judged rashly or proposed casually. Experts should calculate the conclusion using scientific methods. Pauley's proposal is worthy of serious reference; Strike's proposal should not be emphasized; the proposals of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are especially self-serving and harmful to others, and we must not be tempted by them.</p>
<p>(2) After the baseline for maintaining Japan's livelihood has been determined, the industrial standards that Japan should retain in the future should be determined. Existing military and quasi-military industries should be dismantled for reparations and destroyed. The zaibatsu must be thoroughly dissolved; because the Japanese zaibatsu harbor aggression, they are a threat to the industrial survival of Asian countries.</p>
<p>The above two points should be China's minimum demands. Concrete countermeasures can only be formed based on this principle. What we are demanding is the defensive measures taken by industrially backward countries against a country with latent aggression: what we are demanding is that Japan be maintained at a reasonable industrial standard, which can internally adapt to the people's reasonable living standards and externally ensure that all Asian countries no longer have to worry about being invaded and suffering from poverty. We not only have no intention of enslaving the Japanese people, but also are willing to help the Japanese economy move towards democratization.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Japanese Wartime Looting</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) According to the inspection report of our country's representatives, the items stored in the Tokyo World Warehouse are all automobiles, and most of them are not marked with the looted areas. Warehouses 3 and 5 have a large number of items, among which the items marked as looted from our country include Shanghai cloth, books from Nankai and other schools, iron boxes from the Ministry of Transportation, and many letters. The items listed as looted in the Kyoto Museum are mostly antiques and fragments unearthed from Zhangjiakou. The items stored in Fukuoka, some of which are marked as looted from our country, are mostly machines and antiques. The Osaka warehouse has our country's copper coins, nickel coins, antiques, and machines. Among the machines, the storage volume of electric motors and other items is very large. The items stored in Nagoya are copper coins and countless waste copper and scrap iron, including many incense burners, candlesticks, and bronze statues. Regarding the application for the return of looted items, the Reparations Committee had repeatedly sent telegrams to the provincial and municipal governments, informing the looted parties to fill out the prescribed forms, submit relevant certificates, and send them to the local provincial and municipal governments or competent ministries and commissions to forward them to the committee for negotiation on return. This matter is being actively handled. The committee urgently hopes that the owners of the looted items will pay special attention. Those who have not reported or have reported but have incomplete certificates must handle them quickly. If there are any unclear points regarding the handling procedures, they can consult the local provincial and municipal governments, or consult the committee's letter No. 1058, Jing 362, to the provincial and municipal governments on June 7 of this year, explaining the form for requesting the return of enemy-looted materials, the method of filling in the form, and the forms to be prepared, and filling them out accordingly. The person in charge also stated: The looted items that our country has already returned include: (1) Six ships, including Yixian, Xing'an, Hexing, and Heshun, have been transported back to the country one after another. In addition, the Yongyuan ship can be received in January next year, and the Hainan ship can also be towed back to the country soon. (2) Two iron anchors of the Zhenyuan and Dingyuan warships looted in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, ten boxes of anchors, and ten boxes of shells. (3) Four boxes of original plates of banknotes from the Bank of Taiwan. (4) 704 boxes of books, totaling 71,000 volumes, and three computers. Those currently being negotiated for return include 8,000 volumes of books, more than 90 Buddhist statues and temple bells, a gold dragon plate from the Han Wudi era, and cars from Xintong Company. As for the machines from the Yongli Nitric Acid Plant, after repeated negotiations, the Allied Headquarters has officially agreed to our request and approved the return of the Japanese parts. It is currently designated as dismantling and packaging by the Japanese government, and it is expected that it can be received in December this year. In the future, the machines from the Guangdong Provincial Paper Mill can also be handled according to this precedent.</p>

<h3>Wu Weijing Arrives in Hankou, Shaanxi Cotton Transportation Negotiated</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 16th] Wu Weijing, who inspected the cotton yarn business in various places, arrived here today. According to him, the national cotton production this year is expected to exceed the estimated figure (i.e., 11 million dan).

<h3>Yongli Company's Alkali Plant Produces 80-90 Tons of Alkali per Day, Less Than Half of Pre-war Production</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 16th] The Yongli Chemical Company's Tanggu plant is the only alkali plant in our country. It can now only produce 80-90 tons per day, less than half of its pre-war production. This is because the plant was forcibly occupied and operated by the Japanese during the occupation period, and their inferior technology caused great damage to all the machines. According to Li Zhuchen, before the war, our country needed about 120,000 tons of alkali per year, half of which was Yongli's products, and the rest was imported from the United Kingdom. After the victory, the domestic chemical industry has become more developed than before, and the national annual demand for alkali has reached 200,000 tons, while Yongli's production is less than 70,000 tons. British products are limited by transportation and cannot be imported, so the chemical industry is facing great difficulties. Li said: North China is rich in salt and is most suitable for setting up alkali plants. Therefore, he advocates that the Japanese alkali plants should still be dismantled and transported here to solve our country's alkali shortage.</p>
<h3>Guangdong's Grain Supply is Insufficient, Spring Famine Next Year is Worrying</h3>

<h3>India's Printing and Weaving Products are Not Self-sufficient, Tian Heqing Talks About His Return from India</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The recent political and economic situation in India should be of concern to the people of the country. According to industrialist Tian Heqing, who has just returned from India, he took the time to study the textile industry in India when he was in India. It currently has 10 million spindles, but some equipment is very old, and the efficiency of workers is not as high as in our country. India produces a lot of raw cotton, but due to various reasons, the quality needs to be improved. The output of Indian textiles is not self-sufficient. Currently, there is a system of rationing cotton cloth in major cities, and citizens line up to receive it. Therefore, Indian yarn and cloth will never be sold to our country's market in a considerable period of time, and even Southeast Asia, which is close at hand, has no intention of inquiring. However, India has determined a construction plan for the textile industry and other major industries. If the situation is peaceful, it is expected to improve. In terms of the current political situation in India, the two sides are fighting each other for the princely states, and bloody conflicts are endless. When he arrived in India, the passenger planes were often delayed, which can also reflect the tension of the situation. In the Indian civil strife, external forces are also involved, especially in the northwestern border area, which shows that it has an international background. The British seem to have withdrawn from India on the surface, but they still have control in terms of economy and even military affairs, and everything is directed behind the scenes.</p>

At 6:30 PM standard time today (2:30 AM Tuesday Shanghai time), both houses of Congress will hold a joint meeting in the House of Representatives chamber to hear President Truman personally deliver a special message to Congress. The $597 million emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria has been submitted by Secretary of State Marshall, and the relevant committees of both houses have been deliberating on it in detail for a week. The content of Truman's message on how to prevent the threat of domestic inflation is still unknown to the outside world. There seems to be a serious conflict between the long-term aid to Europe plan and the domestic price issue. The long-term European recovery bill will not be formally submitted to the two houses of Congress for discussion until the regular session in January next year. Marshall's request that Congress pass the emergency aid bill by the end of the month is described by some members as mandatory. The government hopes that the foreign aid bill can be discussed from a bipartisan or non-partisan standpoint, but the discussion of domestic economic issues will inevitably have a political flavor. With less than a year until the next election, the Democratic and Republican parties will certainly seize the opportunity to attribute the blame for price increases to the other side, in the hope of gaining the support of the electorate. Both the President and Congressional leaders are striving to focus the special session on discussing the two topics at hand, and avoid side issues, such as the tax cut bill, which has been decided to be postponed until the regular session for discussion.</p>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 16th] President Truman's anti-inflation plan has not yet been announced. Well-informed sources predict that the plan will include the following points: (1) Government control over the sourcing and distribution of scarce and valuable materials needed for foreign aid, such as steel, nitrogen fertilizers, and possibly wheat; (2) Restrictions on lending and restoration of controls on installment payment purchase systems; (3) Increased controls to prevent speculation in basic commodities, such as wheat and other food grains; (4) Extension of export controls. In addition, Truman will emphasize his views on the tax system. He will strongly oppose tax cuts to prevent inflation and will recommend that aid to Europe be paid for with tax revenues.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 16th] Diplomatic officials announced today that President Truman plans to request that Congress stipulate that at least $6 billion be used to procure materials from Latin America and Canada in any long-term aid to Europe plan in order to reduce the consumption of US resources.</p>
<h3>Stimson Calls for Aid to Europe, States Aid to Europe Not Aimed at Anti-Sovietism; Mobilizes Public to Support Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency New York, 15th] Former US Secretary of War Stimson today called for accelerated aid to European countries threatened by communism. In his statement announcing the establishment of the non-partisan committee for the Marshall Plan Aid to Europe (Stimson as Chairman), Stimson declared! The US aid to Europe policy is not an anti-Soviet policy, but a good neighborly act of wishing to help people in distress. Stimson believes that the threat of communism to European countries is purely due to the hunger and panic caused by the consequences of the war launched by the Nazis. He said, "I believe we should take action quickly. The penalty for delay is to increase the difficulty of the work." Under the committee led by Stimson, an executive committee (chaired by former Secretary of War Patterson) and a national conference will be established, with members including more than 200 leaders from industry, commerce, religion, and education. They will launch a signature campaign of one million people to request Congress to approve the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Praises Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters England, Bristol, 15th] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in a speech at a union commemoration festival in Belgium, expressed regret that not all European countries were able to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan. He also said, "During my tenure as Foreign Secretary, I will never be a part of maintaining the chaotic state of the world if others are unwilling to agree." He continued, "The United States will do its best to help European countries engage in mutual assistance. The United States does not want to rule Europe, but to hold European countries accountable. This is also what I am eager to do to enable British coal to form an agreement with Denmark tomorrow to order meat, eggs, and butter. I do not pay attention to others' criticism of me. If we want to solve world problems based on today's general theories, such as communism against capitalism, or so-and-so-ism against so-and-so-ism, we will never be able to solve them, but will cause more disputes. I hope the United States can rise up and seize this opportunity, and I will do my best to cooperate with the United States to end the current plight of Europe."</p>
<h3>US Authorities Consider Banning Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 15th] Observers believe that the recent trend in the United States will cause the US Supreme Court to consider the fate of the American Communist Party and the rights of US military personnel under the Bill of Rights in the next few days. The current investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee into Communist activities in Hollywood is intended to gain public support for two bills that the committee will consider in the next regular session of Congress: one, proposed by Republican Congressman Mundt, stipulates that personnel of any organization ruled or controlled by the Communist Party must register with the authorities in accordance with the Foreign Agents Registration Act; the other, proposed by Democratic Congressman Rankin, stipulates that strict restrictions be placed on the political activities of the Communist Party, such as Communists not being allowed to serve as state or federal civil servants or teachers in public or private schools, not being allowed to disseminate or express sympathy for communism, and those attempting to disseminate pro-Communist publications through the US Postal Service being subject to a fine of up to 10,000 yuan, or imprisonment for up to 10 years.</p>
<h3>US Public Opinion Poll Shows Majority Favors Hardline Stance Against USSR</h3>
<p>[United Press New York, 15th] The latest results from the Gallup poll show that although Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has hinted that the Soviet Union also has atomic bombs, the American people still advocate a tough policy toward the Soviet Union. The poll implied that the Soviet Union also possesses this terrible weapon, but the number of people advocating a more lenient approach toward the Soviet Union has not increased significantly. "World Intelligence" magazine reports that war is widely discussed in the United States, which has greatly alarmed Washington.</p>
<h3>Suspects Arrested in Assassination of Former King Case</h3>
<p>[United Press Bangkok, 16th] The Siamese new government announced today that it has arrested seven suspects in the assassination of former King Mahidol, with one person still at large. According to a spokesman for the Army Headquarters, the person at large is Sethi Chiwi, the secretary of former Prime Minister Panorong, while the whereabouts of Panorong himself are unknown. Of the seven people arrested, one was the former King's secretary, two were palace attendants, and four were kitchen workers. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhong Hao stated that there is solid evidence proving that the late King was poisoned.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministers' Conference Not Optimistic; British Foreign Secretary Bevin Issues Appeal to Stabilize the Situation and Not Miss the Last Opportunity</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 16th] The US government's preparation to submit an aid to Europe plan to Congress and the upcoming discussion of the German issue at the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference have become more closely linked. The proximity of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has made the US government's handling of the aid to Europe plan even more urgent.</p>
<p>However, after reading the recommendations in the Harriman Committee report regarding the German section, one cannot help but feel that if this recommendation is fully adopted, the hope of German economic unification will inevitably fade. The proposal by US Republican foreign policy expert Dulles that if the Soviet Union refuses to sign a four-power, forty-year treaty to prevent German re-aggression, then the UK, the US, and France should proceed with the conclusion of this treaty is nothing short of a shocking suggestion. Although Dulles does not hold an official position, his suggestion to transform the guarantee to prevent German re-aggression into a type of agreement close to an anti-communist pact can show the American public's impatience with the long-delayed German issue. Some people have definite expectations that the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference will inevitably fail, and the division of Germany is inevitable.</p>
<p>[United Press Bristol, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said in a speech here tonight that the upcoming four-country foreign ministers' conference will be the last chance to reach an agreement. It is hoped that the conference will consider the fundamental facts of Europe. We should be rational and not panic. If we want to stabilize the world situation based on existing ideals (such as communism versus capitalism), we cannot stabilize it, but only cause greater chaos.</p>
<h3>Unrest Continues Throughout Italy</h3>
<p>Cerinola Falls into Uncontrollable Situation; General Confederation of Labor Demands Government Ban Fascism</p>
<p>[Reuters Rome, 15th] Unrest continues throughout Italy. Cerinola in the southeast has fallen into an uncontrollable situation. The police cannot cope and have appealed to the city of Bari for help. The local gendarmerie headquarters has been surrounded by crowds, and the police are engaged in a desperate fight with hand grenades and rifles, with numerous casualties, the exact number of which has not yet been ascertained. The local police chief was seriously injured. Unconfirmed reports state that the dead and wounded are being transported by vehicles flying white flags.</p>
<p>[United Press Rome, 16th] The General Confederation of Labor wrote to Prime Minister Gasperi today, expressing its deep desire to avoid civil war, and listing three conditions for stopping the riots: (1) Dissolve the new Fascist organization in the Italian Social Movement; (2) Make every effort to ban general neo-Fascism; (3) Prohibit anti-democratic publications.</p>
<h3>French President Summons Leaders of Various Political Parties for Banquet; To Form a Centrist Government and Strive to Block Attacks from Both Left and Right Wings</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th] The French centrist party leaders originally scheduled to have dinner tonight to discuss ways to solve the current political and economic difficulties, but suddenly announced a postponement, changed to President Auriol hosting a banquet for the leaders of the Socialist Party, People's Republican Party, Radical Party, and Independent Conservative Party on the 16th, and holding talks.</p>
<p>Related parties believe that this talk is an attempt to form a strong government of various centrist parties through agreement to resolve. Tomorrow's luncheon will be held at the President's residence in Rambouillet, near Paris. The participants are expected to include Foreign Minister Bidault, Minister of War Teitgen, Finance Minister Schuman (leader of the People's Republican Party), Prime Minister Ramadier, former Prime Minister and left-wing leader Mollet (above are from the Socialist Party), and National Assembly Speaker Herriot (Radical Party), and former Prime Minister Reynaud (leader of the Independent Conservative Party). Political figures believe that this luncheon is the highest point of behind-the-scenes activities by centrist parties since the Ramadier government obtained a vote of confidence on October 28. The purpose of this activity is to form a strong centrist government to resist the offensive of the extreme right-wing Gaullists and the extreme left-wing Communist Party. The initiator of this plan is Socialist Party elder Blum, who informed Socialist Party leaders that if the centrists fail and de Gaulle seizes power, the republican regime will be declared dead. The Communist Party is also sparing no effort in attacking the "third force" formed by the centrists.</p>
<h3>Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Expected to Be Reinstated</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 16th] Related parties here say that former Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton is expected to re-enter the Cabinet within a year. Some people who support the government are gradually feeling uneasy about the possible consequences of the incident that caused Dalton's resignation, and even feel that it may cause cracks within the Labor Party. It is expected that when the opposition party's request for an investigation into Dalton's dereliction of duty is debated in the House of Commons, there may be a clearer prediction regarding Dalton's future position.</p>
<h3>British Crown Prince's Wedding Nears; The Wedding Cake is Magnificent and Exquisite</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 16th] It was announced here that on the day of Princess Elizabeth's wedding, the route from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey will be guarded by various sections of the British Army. At the same time, the Princess's wedding cake is nearing completion. The cake is nine feet tall and weighs five hundred pounds. It has four layers and is covered with fresh fruits and white cream produced from all parts of the Empire, seasoned with five and a half pints of Jamaican and Trinidadian brandy and spirits, and decorated with seven golden objects representing happiness, namely buttons, rings, thimbles, coins, wishbones, and horseshoes, as well as patterns of various sports that the new couple likes to engage in.

<p>Foreign Journalists Granted Permission to Attend Ceremony [Central News Agency London, 15th] With Princess Elizabeth and Captain Mountbatten's wedding approaching on the 20th of this month, more than 400 journalists from all over the world have applied to attend the ceremony. However, due to the limited seating in Westminster Abbey, only 92 of the 400 applicants were granted seats, half of whom were British journalists, 20 seats for the press of the British Empire and Dominions, and 12 seats for the American press. Of these 12 seats, one seat will be for a Chinese journalist, namely the Central News Agency.</p>
<h3>Belgian Veterans Demonstrate; Request Severe Punishment for Traitors</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 16th Radio: Brussels report, 25,000 veterans who participated in World War II and those who participated in underground work during the war held a demonstration today, demanding that the Belgian government severely punish those who had previously colluded with the enemy, with slogans prominently displaying: "Why are only 151 of the 1,500 traitors sentenced to death executed?"</p>
<h3>Yoshida and Shidehara Reach Agreement, Current Cabinet Facing Crisis, Ashida Expresses Lack of Support for Katayama</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Authoritative sources reveal: Yoshida and Shidehara reached a complete agreement on the 14th during their meeting to discuss the formation of a new conservative party. It is rumored that the Democratic Party's internal split will be triggered by the issue of coal mine nationalization, but the driving force behind the scenes is the movement to establish a new conservative party.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The first session of the Japanese Diet is facing another week's delay due to disputes over the coal mine nationalization bill. The reason given is that the government and party's amendment proposals cannot be submitted to the House of Representatives' Committee on Industry and Mining within the next two to three days due to conflicting opinions between the Socialist and Democratic parties. Furthermore, the House of Councillors has stated that if the bill is not delivered to the House of Councillors by the 15th, it will not be responsible for passing it by the designated date. However, the Liberal Party is strongly opposed to any further extension of the Diet session. Therefore, dark clouds are gathering over the Katayama cabinet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] Democratic Party President Ashida, while en route to attending the Democratic Party congress in Yamagata Prefecture, stated in a speech in Fukushima on the 16th: It is rumored that the Democratic Party may split due to the coal mine nationalization bill, but I do not believe this will happen. Perhaps only two or three members of the Industry and Mining Committee who absolutely oppose the bill will leave the party. As for the peace conference issue, it should be handled by a cabinet that enjoys the deep trust of the people. I do not believe in the so-called notion that the current Katayama cabinet is indispensable. Furthermore, the selection of the Japanese plenipotentiary to be sent to the peace conference has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Next UN General Assembly Meeting Decided to be Held in Europe</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 15th] The United Nations General Assembly decided today, by a vote of 32 to 17, with 5 abstentions, to hold its meeting next year in Europe. The city where the meeting will be held is yet to be decided by a special nine-member committee. Previously, China and the United Kingdom strongly opposed the relocation, arguing that it would cost the United Nations millions of dollars and put the world organization in some procedural difficulties. Since a two-thirds majority is required to increase the budget, and today's decision was passed by only a simple majority, the 17 countries that voted against it may block the necessary expenses for the proposed relocation next year.</p>
<h3>Polish Opposition Leader Stripped of Citizenship</h3>
<p>[United Press, Warsaw, 15th] The Polish Parliament unanimously passed a resolution stripping opposition leader Mikolajczyk of his citizenship and depriving him of his civil rights. Parliament took this action after hearing a report criticizing Mr. Mikolajczyk.</p>
<h3>President Truman Announces Establishment of Loyalty Review Board: Disloyal Individuals Will Not Be Allowed to Serve in the Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th] President Truman announced that any American serving in government agencies who is accused of engaging in secret activities disloyal to the government must be reviewed by the newly established American Loyalty Review Board before being dismissed. The accused should receive written notification of the charges against them in order to prepare a defense. The Review Board will be composed of the most impartial individuals and will conduct the review with the utmost fairness. The President emphasized that while disloyal individuals will not be allowed to serve in the government, dismissals cannot be based solely on rumors or gossip.</p>
<h3>The Korean Impasse</h3>
<p>— By W. L. Chenery, Publisher of American Collier's Weekly, Specially Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>If we can find a way to withdraw from Korea without the Soviet Union taking advantage of it, we would gladly leave Korea quickly.</p>
<p>The American military sentry post on the 38th parallel in Korea is perhaps the loneliest place in all the occupied territories. At the beginning of the occupation, the Soviet sentry posts were quite close to ours, and sometimes the soldiers talked to each other in a fairly amicable manner. But those days are gone. Currently, both sides have moved their sentries back to avoid accidents. Next to the railway tracks, there are signs warning people not to stray into the wrong zone, because if we are not careful and wander from the American-occupied zone into the Soviet-occupied zone, we risk being shot.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Americans have had one opportunity to go to the Soviet-occupied zone of Korea. In April of this year, twenty-three soldiers and six officers of the US 7th Infantry Division worked with Soviet personnel to survey the 38th parallel. They worked and lived with the Soviets for several days, and each person recorded what they saw and heard. The Soviet side did not create a collective report, so it was not published, but I (the author) happened to obtain a copy, which contains the following:</p>
<p>Equipment—The individual weapons provided to the Soviet soldiers were well-maintained and of good quality, but very old. The cars had been repaired repeatedly. Almost all of the vehicles seen in the Soviet zone were American-made, acquired by the Soviet army during the war under the Lend-Lease agreement. The people using these vehicles seemed to lack both resources and knowledge to keep them in good condition. The jeep used by the Soviet personnel in the survey team repeatedly broke down.</p>
<p>Clothing—The clothing worn by the Soviet soldiers was of different styles, insufficient in quantity, and worn out. Most of their uniforms were made of good material, but were too old and dirty. Most of the Soviets did not wear socks, and before putting on their leather boots, they wrapped rags around their feet. The boots were also so old that they were almost unusable. On one occasion, the Soviet personnel stayed overnight in the American zone south of the 38th parallel, and many Soviets refused to shower because they said they had no underwear to change into and therefore could not maintain personal hygiene.</p>
<p>Living conditions—The senior personnel in the survey team at best slept on simple iron beds with straw mats, but most Soviet soldiers slept on the floor, and the mattresses were very dirty. There were no bathing facilities, only stream water and well water. Soviet soldiers used the water they could find nearby for bathing and drinking without any cleaning.</p>
<p>Food—The officers and soldiers of the 7th Division ate well when they lived with the Soviets. Most of them believed that because the Soviet soldiers were quite healthy, they must have good food, but some facts showed that most of their food was supplied locally.</p>
<p>Morale and discipline—Most of the soldiers in the 7th Division thought that the morale of the Soviet soldiers seemed quite high. The people serving were young, but very few had combat experience. They seemed quite happy, but like most American soldiers, they talked mostly about home and everyone seemed to want to leave Korea and return to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the Soviet soldiers are well-trained. Perhaps more so than us. Although the Soviet service personnel are young, most of them joined the military early; they have served in the military for a longer time than American soldiers of the same age.</p>
<p>The Soviets have already organized a Korean army of about 150,000 to 200,000 men in northern Korea. In the American-occupied zone, the army has not been organized. Although General Hodge has trained a small police force, numbering only 28,000 men. Therefore, the Soviet Union can send this Korean army south at any time and establish a communist government throughout Korea. If this really happens, General Hodge does not have enough troops to prevent its invasion.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union decides to order the Koreans to attack south, the American army can only retreat as quickly as possible, but the problem does not end there. The Soviet Union can occupy Korea, but currently the Soviet Union cannot occupy Japan. The Japanese believe that the Soviet Union is eyeing Japan's land, resources, and manpower. This is the basic reason why Japan hopes the United States will continue to occupy Japan for a long time.</p>
<p>We remain in Korea, undertaking a troublesome and dangerous task, which is to prevent communism from spreading to other parts of the world. If we can find a way to withdraw from Korea without the Soviet Union taking advantage of it, we would gladly leave Korea quickly.</p>
<p>The Koreans do not want us to leave, but we always hope to leave immediately when we can. The question is also how we can negotiate a solution with Japan and, to some extent, with China. What kind of defense can we build in the Far East Pacific region? This question has a decisive effect on our own future and how long we will remain in Korea.</p>

<h3>Difficult to Implement Demolition of Houses on Tianmu Road, Residents Willing to Live and Die with Houses, Senator Requests Six-Month Postponement</h3>
<p>The first phase of the demolition of houses on Tianmu Road for road widening, as stipulated by the Public Works Bureau, requires the prior demolition of 14 houses obstructing the road alignment. This morning, a special commissioner from the bureau went to enforce the demolition accompanied by the police. However, the residents of these 14 houses still refused to move, and declared that they were willing to live and die with their houses, leading to a stalemate and making enforcement impossible. The head of the North Station Police Sub-bureau, Ying Zhichun, fearing accidents, came forward to persuade the residents, but to no avail. He then asked the Public Works Bureau to postpone the enforcement for one day and ordered the residents to move out important items immediately.</p>
<p>Furthermore: Senator Tao Baichuan visited Speaker Pan yesterday to plead on behalf of the residents in the area, requesting a postponement of six months. Mr. Pan immediately telegraphed Mayor Wu, requesting his approval. However, the Mayor stated that he could not retract this decision. According to Mr. Pan: Delaying the demolition of these 14 houses until the beginning of next year would not seem to cause much harm, allowing the residents to get through the New Year.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting of Asian Labor Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Tian Heqing Returns to Shanghai to Discuss Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The preparatory meeting of the Asian Labor Conference was held at the National Congress Hall in New Delhi, India, from its opening on October 27 to its conclusion on November 8. Of the Chinese delegates, Bao Huaguo flew to Chongqing, Wu Yunxu remained in Hong Kong, and the remaining delegates, including Tian Heqing, returned to Shanghai on the 14th. Mr. Tian spoke in detail with reporters yesterday about the proceedings of the meeting, stating: The nature of this preparatory meeting was to discuss and prepare the issues to be raised at the first Asian Labor Conference to be held in China in 1949. The main purpose was to find ways to ensure the livelihoods of workers, increase worker income, and develop industry and stabilize the economy. All Far Eastern countries except Japan, Korea, and Indonesia sent representatives to participate. A total of more than 30 proposals were discussed at the congress, with India submitting the most. China submitted nine proposals, including one concerning limiting the industrial development of Japan so that it could no longer harm other Asian countries with its dumping policies, which was passed by the congress after repeated discussions.</p>
<p>All Proposals Categorized into Four Groups</p>
<p>All proposals were categorized by the congress into four groups: Program of Action Group, on minimum wage, working hours, night work for female workers, etc., on how to implement the regulations of the International Labor Bureau in Asia, where industrial standards are far from those of Europe. Social Security Group, on social insurance, worker income security, medical and health implementation, etc., recommendations. Labor Policy Group, including technical training, worker employment, elimination of subcontracting systems, treatment of female and child labor, worker housing, cooperative enterprises, etc., suggestions. General Review and Recommendations, on how to develop the Asian economy, improve production technology, and transfer surplus rural populations to industrial production, etc. All proposals passed will be submitted to the International Labor Bureau to organize investigation teams and research teams to investigate facts based on principles and reach conclusions, which will be discussed in detail at the first congress in two years.</p>
<p>Sharp Opposition Between Labor and Management Representatives</p>
<p>Mr. Tian also said: At this preparatory meeting, the opposition between labor and management representatives was very sharp, with government representatives acting as mediators. Before each general meeting, labor and management each had small group meetings to unify the opinions of representatives from various countries and take concerted action. Even so, this method of having government, labor, and management jointly discuss issues is still the best way to resolve labor disputes. Mr. Tian and others also visited Nehru and Gandhi during their trip. Nehru's complexion was very fair, while Gandhi was not emaciated but had an excellent physique. Even at the age of seventy-eight, one could not see a single rib on his chest. Therefore, the delegation had a humorous saying: "Nehru is not black, Gandhi is not dry," which was also an interesting anecdote of the trip.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall Fully Stocked with Domestic Products</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall opened on the twelfth of this month, with a dazzling array of exhibits. Visitors have been extremely crowded in recent days. The hall is well-stocked with products from domestic manufacturers, categorized and displayed with explanatory cards. Visitors can easily find what they are looking for by following the diagrams, making it an effective way to promote domestic goods. It is also learned that the hall's visiting hours are from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day, including Sundays, while it is closed on Mondays. All Chinese and foreign merchants, school groups, and people from all walks of life are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Air Freight Business Increases Sharply, Tenfold Increase Since August</h3>
<p>Domestic civil aviation has developed significantly in two years, especially between January and August of this year, with several-fold increases in war goods, mail, and passengers. According to the person in charge of China National Aviation Corporation: The reason for this sharp increase is that land and water transportation are frequently disrupted by communist sabotage, while air transport is safer and faster than land transport. As a result, freight, passenger transport, and mail are all shifting to air transport, resulting in a sharp increase in business. According to the company's business report, freight volume in August increased tenfold compared to January, passenger traffic increased threefold, and mail increased twofold. It is also expected that air transport will become even busier in the future due to the popularization of civil aviation. Therefore, both civil aviation companies have plans to purchase new aircraft or increase the number of flight routes.</p>
<h3>Conservation Campaign Takes Effect, Power Supply Situation Improves</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, the city's power supply situation has indeed improved for three reasons: The cost of living has risen, worker salaries have increased, and work efficiency has improved. The conservation campaign has been effective. Factories with generators have successively generated their own electricity and supplied half of their power to other factories. However, every winter, the demand for electric heating increases sharply, causing power shortages. In addition to making every effort to increase supply, it is hoped that citizens will conserve electricity in order to safely get through this severe period of power shortages.</p>
<h3>Refugees at the Second Temporary Relocation Center Call for Payment of Severance Pay</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The 42 refugees originally at the Second Temporary Relocation Center for Refugees at 31 Dihua Road were notified yesterday by the center that all refugees must go to the Unemployment Workers Assistance Committee on Changyang Road today to register for resettlement, otherwise they will be considered to have given up their rights. These refugees stated that the center belongs to the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, and the center has not been closed, and the Shanghai Refugee Reception and Transport Office has not changed. Furthermore, the center previously announced that refugees would be given a blanket, a set of cotton clothing, four bags of flour, and a relief fund of 24,000 yuan per person, which has not yet been realized. They said that most of them are public educators and family members of soldiers who fought in the war who came to Shanghai after many hardships and have no relatives to turn to. Now, due to the communist rebellion, they have no home to return to and their lives are in dire straits. They appealed to society for sympathy and requested three months' worth of severance pay based on the cost of living in Xinjin.</p>
<h3>North Station Baggage Room Renovated into New Premises</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The baggage room at the North General Station of the two railroads has recently been renovated due to the increase in passengers, which has led to a daily increase in baggage business, and the original premises were insufficient. In order to facilitate passengers' consignment and retrieval of luggage, the original site has been renovated, adopting the latest European and American railway baggage room architectural styles, and striving to simplify and expedite the internal procedures. Construction will begin within days and is expected to be completed by the end of this month, to be implemented from the first of next month.</p>

<h3>Set Designer Killed by Driver, Charged with Negligence Causing Death</h3>

After receiving the report, the police detained Zhang Xuecheng and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. After investigation, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun found that the defendant, while driving, failed to pay attention to the safety of pedestrians crossing the road, which was his duty of care in his profession, resulting in the victim being injured and killed. The defendant was clearly in a situation where he should have paid attention but did not, and therefore committed the crime of "negligence in the course of business causing death" under Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law and was prosecuted according to law.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 6:30 PM on the 14th, two sisters, Zhu Xiufang and Zhu Xiuxia (residents of No. 705 Beijing Road), suddenly arrived at the Hengfu Jewelry Store at No. 368 Nanjing Road with an old silver "airplane" (ornament), requesting the store to repair it. Staff member Tang Youmei negotiated a price of 200,000 yuan. The two women then inquired about gold dragon and phoenix bracelets. Staff member Qin Xinzhang took out a three-tael bracelet, and as they were examining it, four men dressed in yellow shirts and suits suddenly barged in, claiming to be selling black market gold and that it was according to the "Ten Articles Ordinance." They forced the two Zhu women and Qin onto a car and took the three-tael gold bracelet, claiming they were taking them to the Garrison Headquarters. Before long, the car arrived at the entrance of the headquarters. One man got out and went inside, then came out and falsely claimed that he had received an order from the section chief to take them to the Jiangwan Headquarters. He then directed the driver to drive towards Jiangwan. En route, they stole 445,000 yuan in legal tender from the women's purses, tore out a page from a diary, and threatened the two staff members into writing a confession admitting to black market trading. When the car reached the intersection of Shuidaidian Road and Tiyu Society Road, the four people were driven out of the car, and the driver was ordered to drive towards Qimei Road.

<h3>Kidnapping: Small Owner of Suitcase Store Rescued After Arrest of Criminals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Criminal police officers Ma Xishu and Nie Jianyuan, along with uniformed police officer Shi Quansheng (No. 1101) from the Laoza Police Sub-bureau, were patrolling Xiamen Road and Zhejiang Road at approximately 4:00 AM yesterday morning when they saw a shabbily dressed man acting suspiciously. They stopped him and found two pawn tickets on his person. When questioned about their origin, he gave evasive answers. He was taken to the bureau for questioning and was found to have a note that read: "This child is the young owner of the Xinshengshun Suitcase Store at No. 14 Kangjia Lane, Xiaodongmen. Kindly deliver him to his home."</p>
<p>After repeated questioning, he confessed the truth. He claimed his name was Jin Wenbin and that he was a neighbor of the aforementioned Xinshengshun Suitcase Store and knew they were wealthy. On the evening of October 19th, at 8:00 PM, he went to the store under the pretext of buying candy and took the opportunity to hide the store owner's three-year-old son, Tang Xiaomin, without a trace. He then sent letters to the store owner's wife three times, stating that Xiaomin was in Chongming and was in good health, and that he was borrowing 500 million yuan for his team's use, otherwise there would be danger. If they wanted to redeem the boy, they could write a letter on the 18th and place it under the Zhongshan Bridge at the Zhaofeng Garden train pier under a broken coffin near a Pepsodent toothpaste advertisement sign, and they would receive it. Based on his confession, Section Chief Jiang, along with officers Tang Zhiliang, Sun Zhiming, Liu Zongtong, Yang Zhongmin, Xu Guizhu, and others, rushed to No. 14 Kangjia Lane, Nanshi, and No. 78 Fanhuangdu Road, and arrested accomplices Cao Renfu, Tian Chengde, and Jiang Zhigao, a letter-splitter who wrote the threatening letters.

<h3>Speaker Visits District Governments on the Second Day, Explaining the Understanding of Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Municipal Senate Speaker Pan Gongzhan's visit to various district to inspect implementation. In the morning, he visited the Hongkou District, and in the afternoon, he visited the North Sichuan Road District. At approximately 10:00 AM, Speaker Pan, accompanied by Senator Xia, Director Bu Shenghua of the Senate Secretariat, Director Yang of the Health Bureau, Secretary Lu of the Public Works Bureau, and others, departed for the Hongkou District Government to briefly discuss the district's recent administrative situation and preparations for the general election with the district head and others. Subsequently, a visit to various local offices was held, covering 13 local offices. At each office, the local head gave an oral account of the most important current work.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan carefully considered each report and promised to convey the information to the government for improvement. Subsequently, a group of local leaders and citizens waited at Kunshan Park, and Speaker Pan drove there to meet them. At approximately 2:00 PM in the afternoon, he arrived at the North Sichuan Road District and visited each local office, covering 12 local offices.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan completed his visit to the various local offices at approximately 5:00 PM and then went to Fuxing Middle School to deliver a speech to over a thousand assembled citizens. The topic of the speech was "The Knowledge that Citizens Should Have on the Eve of the General Election." He briefly stated that the responsibilities and behaviors of the people and the government towards the country in the constitutional period are different from those in the period of political tutelage. Therefore, on the eve of the general election, it is first necessary to have a clear understanding of the evolution of the national political system. In the constitutional period, the people should have the following understandings: 1) To transform from the previous "governed" to the new era of "self-governance." All citizens are the masters of the country, with equal rights and obligations. 2) To transform from the previous "monarchy" or "officialdom" to the new era of "democracy," creating public opinion politics, where everything depends on the parliament, and breaking the stubborn idea of "common people do not discuss politics." 3) To transform from the previous "rule of man" or "rule of virtue" to the new era of "rule of law," giving absolute authority to the law, so that officials in the legislative, judicial, or administrative branches, like the people, must abide by the law. 4) To transform from the previous monarchy or government holding the four major powers of "life and death," to the new era where the people hold the four major powers of "election, recall, initiative, and referendum," gradually creating a situation where the people have power. 5) To transform from the previous "each sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, regardless of the frost on others' roofs" principle of "taking care of oneself," to the "seeking broad shelter for all the world's poor" principle of "benefiting the world," where the people use methods of electing capable individuals to directly or indirectly manage the affairs of the public. Finally, Speaker Pan stated that he is also a candidate for the National Assembly representative and hopes that citizens will use their conscience and discernment to support his candidacy for the National Assembly representative so that he can contribute his abilities and intelligence to represent his compatriots and promote the realization of national democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan is scheduled to visit the Yimiao District this morning and the Xuhui District this afternoon. He may also meet with some of the local leaders and district citizen representatives from the Fahua District to consult on local conditions. At 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM, he will give campaign speeches at the Penglai Grand Theater and the Guangfu Temple Square on Fangbang Road, respectively. The topic of his speeches will be "The Nanshi after the War," and it is expected that many citizens of Shanghai South will attend.</p>

More than 5,000 citizens attended the speech. This was the first public speech in a park by a National Assembly candidate in this city. Fang appeared at the venue amidst enthusiastic applause. Dressed in a gray suit and with a smiling face, he frequently shook hands with citizens to express his gratitude. He then took the stage to deliver a speech titled "Everyone Elects Me, I Serve Everyone." He briefly stated: "Brothers, I have been in Shanghai for over a year now. In this past year, everything I have done has been to serve the citizens and assist Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan in seeking stability for Shanghai. I believe I have done my best for the people. I have been serving the people of Shanghai from the Party's perspective for over a year, and now I hope to be able to further represent the people and speak for them at the National Assembly, implement the people's demands, and serve the people to the end. Therefore, I am running for the National Assembly in Shanghai and asking for everyone's help. I believe that being elected as a National Assembly representative does not represent myself but represents the citizens of Shanghai. A successful campaign is not a personal victory but the glory of everyone. Your vote for me is equivalent to voting for yourself. After being elected, I am determined to maintain my past style and do my best to serve the people. I hope that everyone will use their conscience to judge, rely on their sense of justice, and vote for me." The speech lasted for nearly 20 minutes, and the audience felt excited.</p>
<p>Li Chonghu, a Candidate for the National Assembly from the Women's Community in Jiangsu Province, Expresses Her Campaign Views</p>
<p>Our reporter recently interviewed Ms. Li Chonghu, a candidate for the National Assembly representing women's groups in Jiangsu Province. She briefly stated her campaign views, saying: Regarding the matter of gender equality, she believes that men and women should have equal opportunities to develop their talents and interests freely and should not be forcibly bound by artificial systems. As for women's education, the first priority is to eliminate illiteracy, which is the most active task that should be carried out nationwide. Secondly, the government and various social organizations should actively promote and widely establish women's factories, women's stores, etc., so that women without families or those who are unemployed can have work to do. Finally, regarding the popularization of children's welfare throughout the country, she believes that this is an urgent matter that requires government assistance and the organization of knowledgeable women to strengthen publicity. If all women in the country can universally obtain the minimum amount of knowledge about childcare and hygiene, it will definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Ms. Li is the eldest daughter of the late famous Jiangsu educator Li Gengsheng. Early in life, she followed in her father's footsteps and engaged in educational work. At the age of twenty, she served as the principal of Huaiyin Women's Elementary School, and later taught at Haizhou Middle School, Yangzhou Middle School, Zhenjiang Normal School, and other schools for more than ten years. When she married Zhao Di, she donated the money spent on her wedding to establish Chonghua Elementary School in Zhenjiang. During the Anti-Japanese War, she moved to Jiangxi and led the Third War Zone Women's Work Team to rescue children and establish refugee factories.</p>

<h3>Survey of the Central Section of the Jinpu Railway: The Yanzhou-Jinan Section Urgently Needs to Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>[Jinan, 13th (Airmail)] News came yesterday that the track-laying project for the Yanzhou-Jinan section being undertaken by the Jinpu Railway Administration has been suspended for three days due to a shortage of railroad ties. According to related sources, all 164 kilometers of the Yanzhou-Jinan section that were damaged have had their earthwork completed, totaling 370,000 cubic meters. Of the 360 large and small bridges, 340 have been completed. Only 20 small bridges and 30 kilometers of road surface are delayed due to a shortage of</p>
<p>70,000 Railroad Ties</p>
<p>resulting in the halt of work pending supplies. For this reason, this reporter feels compelled to issue the most urgent appeal to the Ministry of Communications on behalf of the 38 million people of Shandong. At the same time, in order to understand the actual situation of the emergency repair project, I had to brave the northern cold and travel along the railway from Jinan to Tai'an amidst a sea of yellow sand to conduct an on-site survey of the northern section of the Yanzhou-Jinan section in the central section of the Jinpu Railway.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, when the car passed Chaomidian, with the explanation of Section Chief Song Jianfang of the Road Bureau's Engineering Department, who was traveling with me, it was discovered that the seven-kilometer road surface from Chaomidian to Gangshan had only four to six railroad ties filled in for every ten-meter-long rail due to a shortage of ties, which was barely passable by</p>
<p>Light Motor Vehicles</p>
<p>In fact, according to the prescribed standard, fourteen to fifteen railroad ties should be filled in for every ten-meter-long rail in order to allow special express trains to run. Currently, due to the shortage of railroad ties, all of the Yanzhou-Jinan section has been uniformly changed to twelve railroad ties per rail. Therefore, only slow trains and ordinary express trains can run. When the situation improves in the future, if special express trains are to be restored, this section with the short-filled railroad ties will still need to be supplemented.</p>
<p>The 20 kilometers between Gangshan and Wande have not been paved with tracks at all. The original employees, due to the lack of railroad ties, are only continuing to rush to build the</p>
<p>Two Large Bridges</p>
<p>between Tai'an and Jinan, the Shidian River Bridge (5 kilometers south of Zhangxia) and the Wanyu River Bridge (2 kilometers south of Wande). The remaining employees can only be used to tidy up the repaired sections and take on protection work.</p>
<p>According to the bureau's estimate, even with only twelve railroad ties filled in for every ten-meter rail, the 20 kilometers from Wan to Gushan, plus the 7 kilometers from Chaomidian to Gangshan, plus sidings, etc., total no less than 40 kilometers, which requires 48,000 railroad ties. Another 22,000 railroad ties are needed to fill in the 20 small bridges, totaling at least 70,000 railroad ties to complete the opening of the Yanzhou-Jinan section. The main reason is the shortage of railroad ties. Otherwise, there would be no need to wait until the end of the month. The opening of traffic between Jinan and Pukou could be completed by the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, which is in charge of national railway affairs, reportedly has a considerable amount of railroad ties in storage, but it is said that these materials are intended to be used for the restoration of the Zhegan Line and the Jiangnan Railway. In the Ministry of Communications' opinion, those areas are relatively safe. It is uncertain whether the restored central section of the Jinpu Railway will follow in the footsteps of the Jiaoji Railway and be able to stay open for a long time. However, today, the government's supreme national policy is to prioritize military affairs and suppress rebellion. Therefore, even from a</p>
<p>Purely Military Standpoint</p>
<p>the urgent restoration of the Xuji section is the inescapable responsibility of the department in charge. UNRRA may be able to use the excuse of war to refuse to supply railway materials north of 34 degrees latitude to our country, but the Ministry of Communications cannot completely plan only for the revenue and surplus of its own department and disregard national policy and the lives of the people.</p>
<p>In short, from an objective need, the Yanzhou-Jinan section must be completed and open to traffic by the end of this month at the latest. The wise authorities in charge of the Ministry of Communications naturally would not allow the work to fall short due to a mere 70,000 railroad ties (from the Ministry of Communications' perspective, 70,000 railroad ties are really nothing).</p>
<p>After the</p>
<p>Yanzhou-Jinan Section Opens to Traffic</p>
<p>In the first few periods, in order to ensure the safety of passengers, although night trains will not run on the Xuji section, passengers will need to change trains at both Yanzhou and Xuzhou stations. Therefore, the journey from Pukou to Jinan, which used to take only 15 hours before the war, now requires a day and two nights. However, the main income of the railway is not from passenger transport but from freight transport. In the future, large quantities of Shandong's wheat, soybeans, peanuts, cotton, leather, corn, and other agricultural products will be exported. The minimum estimate on the Jinpu Railway Administration's side is that, barring accidents, the monthly income will be between 1.5 trillion and 2 trillion. If the 268 kilometers from Tanggutun south of Tianjin to Sannan Station north of Jinan are also opened and repaired, in other words, after the entire Jinpu Railway is reopened to traffic, its value and significance for domestic military, political, and economic affairs will naturally be even more self-evident.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the people of Shandong, who have been suffocated for nine months, the restoration and opening of the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway is tantamount to regaining freedom and light. (Special Correspondent Litian of this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Dispute Arises During River Crossing: Students from Yuanzhong School Injure Wang Zhibin; School Promises to Expel the Offending Students</h3>
<p>[Hengyang, 16th (Telegram)] Wang Zhibin, the Commissioner of the Ninth District of Yuanling, was returning from the office across the river into the city at dusk on the 10th. He asked his guards to return to the office to retrieve a flashlight. Some students from Yuanzhong School also wanted to cross the river and tried to squeeze into Wang's boat. Wang reprimanded them, and the students refused to comply, leading to a conflict. Wang raised his hand and slapped a student. The students, being numerous, fought back, throwing Wang's hat into the river and injuring him, causing his nose to bleed. Wang hurriedly returned to the office and led his guards to the scene, but the students had dispersed. He ordered the school to hand over the offending students. It is reported that the school has agreed to expel the students.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Forestry Administration Plans to Build 300 New Villages</h3>
<p>[Taipei, 15th (Airmail)] In order to solve the housing shortage in Taipei and help alleviate unemployment, the Provincial Forestry Products Administration has submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government to start building "Forestry Products New Villages" from December. According to Director Tang Zhenxu of the Administration, the new villages will be divided into three types: "Qing" (Integrity), "Shen" (Caution), and "Qin" (Diligence) (the Administration's motto), based on their size. The plan is to build 80 "Qing" houses, 100 "Shen" houses, and 120 "Qin" houses, in three phases. Each phase will take three months. After the completion of the first phase of houses, they will be sold to public school teachers and civil servants. The proceeds will then be used to proceed with the second phase of construction. The location is currently being selected and will cover approximately 120 ping (396 square meters). Regarding the problem of railroad tie supply in this province, it has recently been uniformly handled by the Administration. The supply targets have been specified as the Ministry of Communications, the Provincial Railway Management Committee, and the Sugar Corporation. However, due to the excessive demand, totaling approximately 1.6 million ties, while the estimated production of railroad ties by the province's various forestry areas, the mountain forestry management offices under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural and Forestry Department, and the model forestry areas from October to the end of this year is only over 340,000, the supply falls far short of the demand.</p>

Shen Xuesheng, a native of Xigang in this county, has recently been incited by the Communist bandits to gather more than ten bandits and plot wrongdoing.

<h3>Citywide Games Successfully Conclude Lou Wen'ao Stands Out Breaking National 10,000-Meter Record Middle School Gymnastics Group Rankings Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The 5th Citywide Games successfully concluded. On the last day yesterday, the results of various competitions were extremely outstanding. In the highly anticipated 10,000-meter final, deaf Lou Wen'ao won first place with a time of 32 minutes and 31.2 seconds. Wang Zhenglin also won the runner-up with a time of 34 minutes. Both broke the national 10,000-meter record of 34 minutes and 1 second. However, the wind was strong at the venue yesterday, so Lou Wen'ao failed to break his own record of 32 minutes and 9.6 seconds, which is a pity. In addition, in the high school boys' 200-meter final, Rong Chengbi of Jizha Middle School approached the national record with 22.8 seconds, which was also one of the satisfactory harvests of yesterday's conference. In terms of team scores: The Municipal Institute of Physical Education for Colleges won the women's championship and the men's runner-up in the college group, with the most points. The men's championship for colleges was won by Dongya Institute of Physical Education. In the middle school section, the men's high school and junior high school championships were evenly divided between Gezhi and Jizha, while Yucai won both runners-up. In the women's group, Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School won the high school championship and the junior high school runner-up, while Minli Girls' Middle School won the junior high school championship and the high school runner-up. In the open group, Zhu Shafei won the individual championship with 16 points. Due to the small number of participants in the group, and Chuang Hongda's abandonment of the shot put, and Wang Xuewu's javelin performance being affected by headwind, the results were inferior. It is said that the awards ceremony for various championships will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium at a later date. After five days of competition among thousands of athletes, this glorious event has come to a successful conclusion, and the conference was declared closed in a cheer. The team scores of each group and the results of yesterday's finals are listed below:</p>

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Sports Delegation Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporters Gain Abundant Harvests</p>
<p>The Shanghai reporter Taiwan sports visiting group, organized by the Shanghai Sports Reporters Association, left Shanghai on the Zhongxing Wheel on the 6th of this month. After arriving in Taipei, they stayed for a total of eight days, visiting Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and other places, and gained a lot. Except for Wang Weijun, who still needs to stay for two days due to matters, the remaining nine people, led by Zhang Baokui, left Taipei on a China Airlines plane at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The Director of the Taiwan Provincial Information Office, Lin Ziguan, the Chairman of the Reporters Association, Ye Kaidong, and colleagues from the press all went to the airport to see them off. The plane took off at 11:05 a.m. and arrived at Longhua Airport at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fleet-footed Like a Flying Horse Taking the Lead Jade Arms Lightly Extended, Three Firsts in a Row</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The most exciting program of yesterday's conference was the 10,000-meter final. Lou Wen'ao lived up to everyone's expectations and broke the national record. Although this man is deaf, he is a brave champion on the track, running faster and faster. His score was 32 minutes and 31.2 seconds. When he reached 5,000 meters, it was 16 minutes and 42 seconds. The entire 25 laps, calculated per lap (about 400 meters), averaged no more than one minute and twenty seconds.</p>
<p>There was a little hero, Wang Youyu, participating in the open group 10,000-meter final. Although he is only 16 years old, it only took him 40 minutes to complete the entire journey. He can be said to have unlimited prospects.</p>
<p>Because Lou Wen'ao is deaf, the referee who calculated the number of laps for him was very troubled. After each lap, the referee signaled with a gesture, but he was afraid that he did not fully understand. In the last lap, he specially used a starting gun in front of his eyes to make a sound first. As a result, the referee was sweating profusely and kept exclaiming, "It's really difficult to deal with a deaf-mute person!"</p>
<p>The conference opened for five days. The red silk curtains on the podium have turned white after being scorched by the sun and wind. The ground is covered with nail marks and holes, and the smell of turpentine oil still floats in the air amid the flying paper scraps.</p>
<p>Yan Jingyu, a female student from the Municipal Institute of Physical Education, participated in three sports and softball competitions, winning three firsts and one third. The key to the Municipal Sports Competition winning the women's championship this time lies in her.</p>
<p>Scout Strike A Disturbance</p>
<p>The order of yesterday's meeting was once slightly disturbed. The podium warned the scouts to take responsibility. As a result, the director of military training of a certain school believed that the reporter's tone contained insults to the scouts. He went on stage to negotiate, and all the scouts were angry and went on strike. It was resolved after mediation. The audience outside the venue was confused by this sudden disturbance.</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing about this city sports meeting is that the open group women's competition was missing. It is said that this is because there were not enough people. Huang Mingyuan and others stood by and watched for days. Seeing the female students on the sandbar, vigorous and colorful, they seemed to reveal the feeling of growing thighs again.</p>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, a senior figure in the sports world and honorary vice president of the City Games, also visited the venue yesterday morning. A message was specially broadcast for him in the microphone, attracting everyone's attention.</p>
<p>During the five days of the conference, a total of 18 cases of lost children being claimed occurred. Every time the announcement was made to claim the children, these children had special markings: a sore on the corner of the mouth, holding a sugarcane in the hand, wearing an air force children's uniform, named "Yueying"...</p>
<p>The reporter in the microphone sometimes spoke in authentic Beijing dialect, with a mellow rhyme, but the pronunciation was not accurate. Once he reported: "High school men and women" 400-meter relay preparation at the same time! Long and slow, the audience who heard it downwind asked each other: What? "Dogs and women"?...</p>
<p>Air Rifting Pleasant and Eye-catching</p>
<p>Jizha Middle School won both the high school and junior high school championships in the 400-meter relay race yesterday, so it played military music and set off firecrackers. The sound of drums and cracks lasted for five minutes, and the air in the venue was tense.</p>
<p>When the competition reached its climax, the cheers and cheers from around the venue continued for a long time. Someone would classify the cheers: the college boys were like wolves howling and apes crying, urgent and powerful; the general audience was like the sound of mine bells and drums, long and heavy; and the female students were like air ripping, sharp and relaxed.</p>

<h3>Yiyuan Soccer Showdown: Malayan Chinese Youth Draw, 1-1 Undecided Outcome</h3>
<p>The Malayan Chinese Youth Soccer Team played their second match in Shanghai against Qing Bai yesterday at 3:00 PM. The Yiyuan stadium was packed with fans, and the cheers and firecrackers echoed through the sky. It is estimated that there were over ten thousand spectators, making the atmosphere even more exciting than the first match. Chiang Ching-kuo, Chiang Wei-kuo, and Qian Dajun were also in attendance. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, with Malayan Chinese Youth scoring first in the first half and Qing Bai equalizing in the second half. The match was tense, with both sides having opportunities and competing fiercely. After the game, Qing Bai hosted a banquet for the visiting team at the Shanghai Restaurant. The starting lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Malayan Chinese Youth</p>
<p>Zhu Zhicheng</p>
<p>Chen Jiawan, Zhang Guoxing</p>
<p>Yang Jiasong, Li Yiyao, Wu Jincheng</p>
<p>Mei Runhua, Xie Wenliang, Xia Tixian, Hu Wenbai, Huang Guodong</p>
<p>Qing Bai</p>
<p>Qin Bigao</p>
<p>Wu Kaimin (on), Li Yichen (off), Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Zhang Renyi, Zhai Yongfu, Xue Peiran</p>
<p>Ha Zengming (off), Jin Lusheng, Luo Shoufu (on), Li Yichen (off), Gao Xiuqing, Gu Yisa (off), Jiang Yanqing</p>
<p>Malayan Chinese Youth Scores First</p>
<p>The captains of both teams exchanged flags, and referee Deng Xiaoliang blew the whistle to start the match. Qing Bai had the wind advantage, and Malayan Chinese Youth kicked off. Xia Tixian led the attack, and after two minutes, Qing Bai counterattacked. Qu Yongfu took a long shot from the 30-yard line, but Zhu Zhicheng caught the rebound. After a chaotic scramble, Xia Tixian, Mei Runhua, and Huang Guodong launched a three-pronged attack. Xia took a shot from distance, but it missed. Three minutes later, Qing Bai launched a full-scale attack, with Gao Xiuqing penetrating deep into the opponent's territory. Jin Lusheng took a powerful shot, but Zhang Guoxing blocked it for a corner kick. Both sides exchanged attacks, but the visiting team looked tired and strained. In the 12th minute, the visiting team's fortunes changed. A dangerous situation arose in front of the Qing Bai goal. Hu Wenxiang took a close-range shot, but Qin Bigao parried it away. Xia Tixian recovered the ball, passed it lightly to the right, and Hu Wenxiang unleashed a powerful shot that found the back of the net, opening the scoring at 1-0. Qing Bai launched a major counterattack, but to no avail. The first half ended with Malayan Chinese Youth leading 1-0.</p>
<p>Qing Bai Equalizes</p>
<p>After the break, the teams switched sides and resumed the match. The visiting team's lineup remained unchanged, while Qing Bai made significant changes. Wu Kaimin's old injury flared up, and Li Yichen was replaced at right back. Luo Shoufu was substituted, and Gu Yisa came on, switching positions with Gao Xiuqing. Ha Zengming took up the left wing position, and Jin Lusheng moved inside. After these adjustments, Qing Bai's forward line consisted entirely of young players, making their attack more potent, while the experienced defenders provided solid cover. In the seventh minute, Jiang Chuangqing advanced down the right flank and sent a long pass into the center. Gao Xiuqing made a clever dummy run, Chen Jiawan missed Jin Lusheng, who took advantage and unleashed a powerful shot. The ball went in beautifully, leaving Zhu Zhicheng stunned. Qing Bai equalized at 1-1. The visiting team's formation became increasingly disjointed. After 15 minutes of chaotic play, Qing Bai intended to substitute Xie Qichuan for Xue Peiran, but the referee disallowed it. In the 25th minute, Jiang Chuangqing left the field due to a leg injury. Two minutes later, the visiting team's Huang Guodong also left the field due to a left arm injury. Both teams were now playing with ten men. Shortly after, Jiang Chuangqing returned to the field. Subsequently, both sides launched attacks, but neither managed to score. As time ran out, the match ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>

<h3>China Supports Legal Proposal to Eliminate Racial Discrimination</h3>
<p>Has Been Approved by the UNESCO Program Committee</p>
<p>[United Press, Mexico City, 16th] With the strong support of China and the Philippines, the UNESCO Program and Budget Committee unanimously passed a French proposal calling for the elimination of discrimination based on gender, skin color, and race in educational circles and cultural and educational organizations worldwide. The original proposal was more strongly worded, but South African representative Roberts opposed it, arguing that eliminating racial differences was impractical in countries like South Africa, which has eight or nine million indigenous people, "more than half of whom are still in a primitive stage." Roberts said that South Africa is striving to raise the standards of indigenous people, but in fact, indigenous teachers cannot be given equal opportunities and treatment. The Chinese representative requested that the French proposal be strengthened, as the original proposal did not state "equal pay for equal work."</p>

<h3>Jiang Zhonglin Returns to Shanghai from the United States, Discusses the Current Situation of Fur Trade Import and Export. Development of the Fur Export Industry Should Start with Quality Improvement, 3 Million Yellow Weasel Pelts Were Sold to the US Last Year.</h3>
<p>China's fur export figures were quite considerable before the war, but during the war, sea transport was disrupted, and inventory piled up. Since the resumption of foreign trade, exports have surged last year, totaling approximately 20 million yuan in bonuses, mainly to the United States. This year, due to the war affecting production areas and transportation obstructions, foreign sales have declined. Jiang Zhonglin, chairman of the Shanghai Fur, Oil, and Bone Trade Association, flew from Shanghai to the United States on August 9th to conduct on-site inspections, stayed in New York for over two months to promote fur exports and improve tanning, visited major tanning and carpet weaving factories, and established close contacts with leading manufacturers and fashion design experts. Jiang has now returned to Shanghai last Thursday (the 13th) because of the urgent need to handle affairs in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to Jiang, the previous trip to the United States was purely for private travel, one to contact old customers and the other to visit New York tanneries, study their production methods, and use them as a reference to improve China's fur export business. China's tanning work is adhering to conventions, and its products are difficult to compete with other countries in the international market. For example, China uses rice water as tanning raw material, while they use chemical solutions, and they use machines to make leather, while we rely on workers. Moreover, the United States often processes and replicates the goods exported from China and resells them to various parts of Europe, making a lot of profit. In addition, the carpet manufacturing factories are six or seven stories high, and each floor is for manufacturing each part, from dry cleaning, sorting, selecting, dyeing, weaving yarn to completion, all relying on machines. Before the war, all these raw materials were imported from China, taking its softness suitable for stepping on and rich in elasticity. At present, those engaged in this industry in China have changed their course, and the export quantity is very small. They are taking their own exports to replace them, and they are gradually forgetting that our country's wool is the best raw material for carpets. This point is really worth paying attention to. This time returning to the country, it is decided to invite colleagues to discuss revitalization strategies.</p>
<p>Jiang talked about the United States raising yellow weasels and black foxes to seek product uniformity, which is very interesting. He briefly stated that yellow weasels have strong fertility, and those who raise them individually raise them after mating in order to improve the quality of the seeds, cutting males and keeping females when taking the skin. Usually, they are fed with fish, horse meat, wheat flour, and cod liver oil, and are prohibited from eating fat. As a result, the products are smooth and smooth, and each piece can be worth 20 US dollars. If a ranch has 1,000 yellow weasels, and after multiplying four times, it produces 4,000 skins, the total value can be 80,000 US dollars, deducting the cost, it can be profitable. Every year, the United States and Canada can sell a total of one million pieces. Black fox hair is long, and New York women's fashion does not like long hair. Its products are shipped to Canada and other places for sale. I think that in order to expand the sales of yellow weasel skins in China, improving varieties is an urgent task. If yellow weasel seeds are imported from the United States, the climate is also very suitable. A small-scale trial run requires about 50,000 US dollars. As for improving tanning, it is even more necessary to hire technicians and purchase machines, which costs more money. It cannot be accomplished overnight in a short time. It is necessary to wait for economic stability, gather comrades, and carefully plan.</p>
<p>Jiang also reiterated that in order to promote the export of fur, some parts may be appropriately referred to the consignment method. Try to observe the skins of sheep's heads, ears, noses, tails, and claws in our country, which are often discarded. If they are exquisitely inlaid into clothing and transported to foreign countries for sale, they may arouse the curiosity of American women and be welcomed by them. This is not a hot commodity. The sales method is nothing more than making an appointment with a fashion store for consignment exhibitions. Once purchased, it can gradually become popular for a while. On this point, I will make some suggestions to the Import and Export Management Committee in the near future.</p>
<p>Finally, Jiang said that China sold about 3 million yellow weasel skins to the United States last year. The initial offer was very good, but later the price fell to within 2 yuan due to the influx of goods, and the average value was 2-3 yuan per piece. A total of more than 500,000 lake sheep skins were sold, each worth one US dollar, and 1 million blue sheep skins were sold, initially worth more than 3 yuan, but later fell to one yuan. This spring, about 400,000 yellow weasel skins (last year's goods) have been exported, the actual output is 600,000, and 200,000 are sold domestically. According to the normal output, it can reach 1 million, and it is estimated that 700,000 can be collected this year. The current price of spot goods for foreign sales is about 4 yuan per pair. 300,000 lake sheep skins can be collected, and the current price is 1.45 yuan. About 1 million blue sheep skins, each worth about 1.2 yuan. If the situation improves and transportation resumes, the estimated output can be increased, he said.</p>
<h3>Credit Cooperative Checks Will Be Allowed to Be Used Again</h3>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Finance's prohibition of credit cooperatives from being the payer of checks, it is reported that the Ministry of Social Affairs has prepared a memorandum of reasons, intending to request the Executive Yuan to still allow credit cooperatives to be the payer of checks. Now, in order to strengthen the management of the business of urban credit cooperatives, so that they can develop normally and truly become a financial institution for the common people, the Ministry has consulted with the Ministry of Finance on a draft management method for urban credit cooperatives, which can be jointly requested from the Executive Yuan for approval, promulgation and implementation. The draft of the item method adopts a licensing system for the establishment of urban credit cooperatives. All urban credit cooperatives shall be transferred to the local competent authority to the two departments of the society and finance for identification. Those with unsound organization and business shall be dissolved. Those that have been approved for registration but have not yet started business must be re-examined before they can start business. For the rest, there are clear provisions on the admission of members of credit cooperatives, types of business, loans, amounts, terms, interest rates, deposit reserves, etc.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Sales Are Smooth and Prices Are Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of cigarettes on the market was mediocre at first, but then the market became brisk due to strong demand in the street. At about 9 o'clock, colleagues from other places dumped their goods, and the price seemed weak, but until the close of the noon, the old knife cigarettes were in high demand due to the lack of distribution for a long time, and the bottom was thin, and the buyer absorbed it very smoothly, making it as high as 17.7 million, which was 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. British cigarettes rose by 100,000 yuan. In the half-day trend, the price gap between the Three Cannons and the White Tin Package was large, and the actual sales were very strong. At the close, the price of the Zhao brand increased by 2,000 to 158,000, and someone took it in. In addition, the buying interest in the 20-piece Qianmen Bank brand was also strong, and the market was firm and expensive. 50-piece canned cigarettes arrived in rare sales, and the price rose by 1,200 yuan. Other brandy, double axe, red gold, beauty, and other strip cigarettes were each worth 500 to 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Number of Tobacco Loans This Year is a Total of 28 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>According to the Four Joint Offices, the number of tobacco goods this year is a total of 28 billion yuan, of which 15.6 billion yuan of tobacco leaf production loans and 12.4 billion yuan of processing loans were issued to the two provinces of Anhui and Henan successively. 100,000 tobacco farmers in the two places benefited from planting tobacco.</p>
<h3>Prices in Chengdu Rise Again</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 16th] The price of Sichuan goods, which had been calm for more than a month, rose again on the 15th. On the 16th, each package of Chengdu 20 Shuanghong Wild Goose yarn was 24.9 million, and each piece of American Mishier Indigo Cloth was 2.15 million. All department stores were expensive, and food was stable. The reason is said to be due to insufficient US loans and the accumulation of wealth by wealthy families. The Provincial Capital Police Bureau immediately formed an economic inspection team to control it.</p>
<h3>The Sixth District Paper Industry Appeals for Relaxation of Import Quotas for Wood Pulp from 520,000 to 1 Million US Dollars.</h3>
<p>The Sixth District Paper Industry Association has appealed to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, requesting that the quota be relaxed to 1 million US dollars in order to save the crisis in the industry. It is reported that the wood pulp quota for the first quarter is 450,000 US dollars. In addition to the 100,000 US dollars taken by the paper mills under the Resource Committee and the 50,000 US dollars retained by the paper mills in other districts, the factories in the area of the association only got 300,000 US dollars, which is too small. The second and third quarters are both 525,000 US dollars. In addition to 75,000 US dollars from paper mills in other districts, the factories actually got 450,000 US dollars, which can only import 1,5600 tons of pulp for three months, which is still a large number. If calculated according to the fully equipped production, 15,000 tons of pulp are actually needed per quarter. The current amount is only one-tenth of the amount, and each factory cannot continue to produce, resulting in a state of semi-stagnation, and it is extremely difficult to maintain. In the past, there were paper scraps and broken cloth that could be supplemented, but due to the urgent needs of each factory, the price was also very high. Recently, due to the spread of the war and the obstruction of transportation in various places, the survival of the factories is greatly panicked. Please relax the quota for each quarter to 1 million US dollars, which can import more than 3,000 tons, which is only one-fourth of the actual need, so that it can survive and save the precarious industry.</p>
<h3>After Japan Resumes Foreign Trade, There Are Still Many Difficulties in Private Transactions. Japanese Goods Are of High Price and Poor Quality, and Merchants Dare Not Handle Them Easily.</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Air Mail] The Hong Kong authorities have always adopted a support policy for private foreign trade since Japan announced the resumption of foreign trade. At a time when the government's US dollars are extremely difficult, various foreign exchange applications are restricted very strictly, but it can be seen from the fact that more than a dozen designated trading companies with Japan are designated to allocate a monthly foreign exchange quota of about 25,000 yuan per company. However, Japan's trade has been declared resumed, and now it will be three months. Hong Kong's trade with Japan, except for the government's ability to smoothly exchange goods, private trade has not yet been officially resumed. According to qualified people in trade with Japan, the biggest difficulty in trade with Japan is the high price of Japanese goods. At present, Japanese goods transactions are in US dollars. Although the products of Japanese merchants are based on Japanese yen, they are sold to the Allied authorities, and the Allied authorities calculate the export based on the price of goods around the world in US dollars. Therefore, some Japanese goods that can be exported are unwilling to start lightly due to the excessive price. Even in terms of glass paper with 300 numbers of 90×100 five hundred sheets, the Japanese price is more than 21.1 US dollars, which is not up and down compared with the current pricing in Europe. Secondly, another problem is that the Japanese side still does not allow the establishment of branch offices for Hong Kong businessmen engaged in private trade with Japan, so there are great difficulties in carrying out trade. The reason is that the Japanese have poor credit, which was true before the war, and their products are even worse after the war. For example, a batch of alarm clocks that arrived in Hong Kong a few months ago can be used as an example. Therefore, if there is no branch office established in Japan for contact, Hong Kong businessmen are really not at ease when ordering goods rashly. In addition, there are no inconvenient regulations in the export paper of goods exported to Japan in this port, but the Japanese side restricts the introduction of goods very strictly. Generally, there is no problem in importing raw materials that can be used for reproduction, but consumables and unnecessary goods are mostly listed as restricted imports. As for the transportation baby problem, which is of great importance to the development of trade prospects, ships belonging to Taikoo and Jardine Matheson often travel between Hong Kong and Japan, and there is no major obstacle to the transportation of goods. It's just that business communication between the two places is still difficult. At present, telegrams can be sent from Hong Kong to Japan, but once telegrams are sent directly from Japan to Hong Kong, it is impossible. Airmail from Japan can be paid by the US military aircraft to Hong Kong, but in Hong Kong, there is no civil aircraft to Japan, and military aircraft never fly to it, so airmail cannot be posted from Hong Kong to Japan. From the above-mentioned several major baby problems, the future private trade between Hong Kong and Japan is still difficult to be optimistic about. Regarding the barter exchange between Hong Kong Chang Bureau and Japan, the bulk of the goods transported by Japan to Hong Kong are cotton yarn, cloth, wool, and clocks. Among the goods transported from Hong Kong to Japan, grass mats are the most. This type of grass mat is in great need in Japan and is used for packaging Japanese tea, Japanese silk, and various products.</p>

<h3>Use of Anesthetics to Cut and Treat the Neck (Continued) - Examples of Unexpected Complications</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have also studied the tortuous part of the carotid artery, which also deserves attention. According to Heymans' report, stimulating a dog's carotid artery with chemicals and severing its autonomic nerves will suddenly stop its breathing. Mr. Heymans has thoroughly examined the occurrence of this type of reflex. Previously, we believed that the lack of oxygen and the increase of carbon dioxide in the blood were the driving forces stimulating the respiratory center, but Heymans has proven that this effect is actually caused by a reflex near the carotid artery. Subsequently, several experts such as Heymans, Euler, Bouckaert, and Dautrebande further demonstrated that this type of reflex also exists at the tortuous part of the carotid artery. The stimulating effect of so-called lack of oxygen in the blood is actually an indirect effect. If we remove the reflex driving force of the carotid artery and the tortuous part of the carotid artery, then the lack of oxygen in the blood will not be enough to stimulate the respiratory center to breathe; on the contrary, it will only inhibit its breathing. The same is true when the carbon dioxide in the blood increases. Therefore, only when the reflex driving force (Chemoreceptouen) of the carotid artery and its tortuous part exists can carbon dioxide in the blood be actively utilized. A Mr. Castro believed that the reflex does not occur at the tortuous part of the carotid artery, but at the Glomus Carcticum (i.e., at the bifurcation of the aorta). Subsequently, Heymans also proved that this type of reflex does exist there, and its tortuous part is the regulating mechanism for blood pressure. In addition, there are also starting points for this reflex at the base of the heart and in the middle layer of the myocardium.</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, we can study whether the starting point of this type of reflex is related to the accidents that occur when anesthesia is performed during surgery. A Mr. Weese has conducted a detailed study of this type of problem. He injected turpentine oil near the bifurcation of the carotid artery of dogs to cause abscesses. At this time, he injected the usual amount of the above-mentioned anesthetic into the vein, and the result was no change. From this, it can be seen that the abscess itself does not have any direct effect that can cause the occurrence of a reflex. However, if half of the above amount is used, and at the same time, slight pressure is applied to the angle of the jaw, breathing will immediately stop, and no medicine can revive it. The most amazing thing is that if the side without an abscess is pressed with a finger, there is no change at all. If the anesthetic is injected into the vein and delayed for a moment, about five minutes later, even if the abscessed side is pressed, the above-mentioned breathing cessation phenomenon will not occur. In short, the longer the waiting period after injecting the anesthetic into the vein, the less likely this sudden cessation of breathing is. If the bifurcation of the carotid artery is completely cut off, this type of reflex will not occur. This is because the main organ of the reflex has been removed. Based on the above facts, we can infer that this type of reflex is the last to be affected by the anesthetic and inhibited during the anesthesia period. In other words, the nerve units at the bifurcation of the carotid artery are not easily inhibited by the anesthetic in the early stages of anesthesia, and can still produce a reflex that stimulates breathing cessation. Although this assumption is reasonable, it also needs to be proven by facts. According to Mr. Weese's opinion, because the posterior pharyngeal area here relies only on a single small artery to maintain blood supply, when an abscess occurs, it is extremely easy to stimulate the nerve units here to generate a reflex that inhibits breathing due to the obstruction of blood flow. We can certainly wonder why this type of reflex only occurs when an abscess is present? This is mostly because after the abscess occurs, the driving force of the reflex is more susceptible to stimulation, and its original inhibitory effect on breathing is enhanced as a result. If the anesthesia continues and the patient feels a deeper anesthesia, then at this time, the reflex nerve units in this area will also be anesthetized and will not have the phenomenon of inhibiting breathing again and can breathe normally. However, the stronger and faster the anesthetic effect, the more severe its reactive force will be, which is something that must be paid attention to (for example, when using Chioraetliy or Barbiturate).</p>
<p>In short, there are three factors that constitute sudden cessation of breathing: Inflammatory or purulent neck diseases; Short-term rapid infusion of anesthetics with a very fast anesthetic effect; Local mechanical stimulation (such as pressing the root of the tongue, pressing the neck, and waiting for the jaw to relax). When the above three factors are all present in the above-mentioned cases, it is clear that the patient will die. In view of the current unfortunate experience, we certainly know that using intravenous anesthetics during surgical operations for inflammatory neck diseases is the most dangerous act. If there is another method to think of, we must try our best to avoid it. If this method must be used, then it must be done with extreme caution. The injection must be absolutely slow, and after the injection, you must wait for a few minutes before taking other actions (such as pressing the root of the tongue, putting in a tongue depressor, and performing surgery). It is especially important to pay attention to avoiding all mechanical stimulation to the bifurcation of the carotid artery.</p>
<p>Junqing's note: Mr. Graf's report has greatly increased our knowledge. In the anesthesia period before surgical hand hygiene, there are often unexpected events of sudden respiratory arrest in patients. We do not know the reason, and always think it is due to "idiosyncrasy." Now, according to Mr. Ge's report, we know that there are still many complex factors that contribute to it. The case of Dr. Qian Mingzhao of Nanjing being accused may also be similar to this. But I don't know if anyone can study its details? Moreover, the above-mentioned case occurred in Sweden, and the chief surgeon was not accused of negligent homicide. If this case occurred in China, I don't know how far it would have gone. Alas, in such a scientifically backward country, after eight years of resistance war, we still don't think about making any changes to health administration and medical affairs that are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihood?</p>

<h3>A Corner of X-Ray Examination Statistics</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>With the advancement of modern medicine, disease statistics are especially closely related to public health. From this, we can observe the rise and fall of a disease and the scope of its epidemic, so how to prevent problems before they occur and gradually eliminate them, change from treatment to prevention, and let the people live a long life. Isn't that a happy thing? This is our responsibility, and we must work together to do it. Now, I will list the X-ray examination statistics of 647 people in the Hongqiao Rehabilitation Hospital in October as follows, and I hope that the sages at home and abroad will teach me.</p>
<p>Bilateral Pulmonary Tuberculosis 56 people 8.62%</p>
<p>Bilateral Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Cavities 7 1.07</p>
<p>Bilateral Artificial Pneumothorax 2 0.30</p>
<p>Right Pulmonary Tuberculosis 57 8.77</p>
<p>Right Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Cavities 1 0.15</p>
<p>Left Pulmonary Tuberculosis 30 4.62</p>
<p>Left Pulmonary Tuberculosis with Cavities 2 0.30</p>
<p>Left Artificial Pneumothorax 2 0.30</p>
<p>Calcified Spots 10 1.54</p>
<p>Blurred Shadows 4 0.62</p>
<p>Pleural Thickening 13 2.00</p>
<p>Pleurisy 8 1.23</p>
<p>Deep Bronchial Shadows 135 20.79</p>
<p>Deep Hilar Lymph Node Shadows 24 3.69</p>
<p>Cardiomegaly 21 3.69</p>
<p>Normal Cardiopulmonary 282 43.42</p>
<p>Looking at the above statistics, we can see the following situations: The large number of people suffering from bilateral pulmonary tuberculosis can prove the lack of general social knowledge. Although both lungs are diseased, they are still unaware of it, which is really regrettable. At the same time, it can be seen that the initial symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis are extremely mild, and general diagnosis is difficult. X-ray examination is essential. The age between 20 and 30 years old is the peak of pulmonary tuberculosis patients, especially around 25 years old is the most dangerous age. From the perspective of occupation, "42 people out of 157 unemployed people were found to have pulmonary tuberculosis, which is almost one-third. This situation deserves special attention.</p>

<h3>Two Major Advances in the Scientific World</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>The realm of the scientific world is expanding day by day, and soon there will probably be many new stocks coming in to continue to expand its scope. The end of October this year is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University in the United States. At this anniversary meeting, the entire American scientific community had wonderful speeches. The most noteworthy thing is that two scientists who won the Nobel Prize announced their groundbreaking discoveries that shocked the academic world.</p>
<p>The Secret of Matter</p>
<p>Ernest O. Lawrence, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics and inventor of Cyclotrons, announced that he had recently built a 4,000-ton Synchro-cyclotron and had discovered the secret of the mysterious and powerful "Binding force" in the original ten nuclei. When this synchrocyclotron was turned on for the first time at the University of California, powerful rays were emitted from its circular inner chamber. This powerful ray still retained more than half of its intensity after penetrating a foot-thick lead plate. After research by many scientists, it was discovered that this beam was composed of neutrons (particles in the nucleus without charge). Once there are deuterons (heavy hydrogen nuclei) in the impactor to impact the target, these neutrons are shattered and left behind. At the same time, under the leadership of Lawrence, they seemed to be playing with toys all day long, and finally proved that this neutron beam can almost impact any atom and destroy any radioactive element.</p>
<p>We know that all atomic nuclei (except hydrogen atoms) contain two or more protons. Protons all carry a positive charge. In theory, they should repel each other very strongly, but they are attracted by a mysterious binding force. Where does this binding force come from? For many years, tens of thousands of scientists have been seeking its answer, and today it is finally revealed.</p>
<p>Long before World War II, German Nobel Prize in Physics winner Dr. Werner Heisenberg had used mathematical formulas to deduce a theory to explain this phenomenon. He believed that the charge between protons and neutrons in the nucleus is quickly exchanged back and forth. When a particle gains a charge, it becomes a proton, and when it loses a charge, it becomes a neutron. It is this "Charge exchange" phenomenon that produces this powerful binding force. However, he has never been able to prove the correctness of this theory.</p>
<p>Now, Lawrence has helped him prove this theory. When high-speed neutrons impact on the walls of an ionized impactor, what bounces back are protons. He believes that the proton that jumps back is the neutron that went to hit the wall. In addition, when a neutron and a proton are very close, the charge on the proton jumps back and forth between the two. Once the two come into contact, the charge immediately goes to the neutron, making it a proton. If this phenomenon is the only explanation for the binding force between protons in the nucleus, it will be an extremely powerful new advance in the scientific world today.</p>
<p>The Secret of Life</p>
<p>The day after the anniversary ceremony, Wendell M. Stanley of the Rockefeller Institute for Midical Reasearch raised an explosive and mysterious question: What is life?</p>
<p>Dr. Stanley is an authority on American germ research and winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Twelve years ago, he discovered a fact that shocked the academic world, that a certain virus (the virus that causes tobacco mosaic disease) is "Both living and dead". It can reproduce like a living organism and also form crystals like an inorganic chemical. This new development immediately attracted widespread attention, and thousands of scientists immediately went to explore this new field. Recently, Dr. Shi has integrated some research materials on these semi-living and semi-dead tiny things, which has made him have new progress in the explanation of life.</p>
<p>This very small virus cannot be seen under an ordinary microscope, but it can be seen very clearly under an electron microscope. The virus that causes tobacco mosaic is a tiny rod. These rod-shaped viruses can interact with each other from a long distance, like small magnets interacting with each other. Although he cannot explain this "Long-Range force", he has a new understanding of the life of organisms from this. He and his assistants used a series of "Chemical Process" to "stop the activity" (actually die) of this virus, and then reversed this chemical process to revive it. From this point of view, in the future, it may not be possible to use a certain chemical process to let humans die in a test tube and then revive them.</p>
<p>Most of these viruses contain proteins and amino acids. Precise chemical methods can be used to increase or decrease the amino acids in their bodies, which can turn active viruses into lethargic ones and mild viruses into virulent toxins. And they found that once they change their physique, they also permanently change their descendants. Therefore, Dr. Stanley predicts that this has a great connection with human life, because human transfer factors (a small particle in cells that can control human heredity) and viruses are very similar. It is very possible that just a small change in the number of amino acids in the transfer factor can greatly change heredity. If this is the case, if humans improve their transfer factors, can they control their own evolution? The doctor said: "Yes, this is possible... but this knowledge is somewhat damaging to the self-esteem of humans who think they are superior."</p>
<p>This is an Antarctic penguin, which is kind, quiet and well-organized, standing upright like a human figure. When young, its fur is all black. After growing up, its chest fur is white and its back fur is black. It only lays two eggs in its life, which are incubated into chicks in the ice and snow. It can still continue its species. Nature is also wonderful. (Xi)</p>
<h3>Salt and Life</h3>
<p>— Peel</p>
<p>Salt is what we see every day. It is a square crystal. It is not as indispensable as rice for every meal, nor is it as casual as candy that you can choose not to eat. It is also something that must be eaten, but you can occasionally miss one or two meals. If it is often lacking, then the human body will gradually feel uncomfortable, and the neck will gradually become thick and swollen, which is a goiter. Then the spirit will decline, and other diseases will follow! In the human body's tissues, salt is abundant. You see, blood, muscles, sweat, and urine all have a salty taste.</p>
<p>But salt itself is composed of two elements, chlorine and sodium. Elemental chlorine is very poisonous, so of course it is not desirable. Elemental sodium cannot be eaten either, because its chemical properties are extremely strong. If you put sodium into water, it will undergo a violent chemical change, turning into sodium hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas, while generating high heat, and even exploding. But combining sodium and hydrogen to form salt is a good thing with a salty taste, and many delicacies rely on it.</p>
<p>Humans need it, and any animal needs it, so won't it be used up like coal? But it won't. It is abundant in nature. The boundless ocean is three percent salt, and there is also rock salt on the mainland. Moreover, salt can be said to be cyclical for animals. The amount eaten is the same as the amount excreted. On a larger scale, the life and death of animals is a larger cycle of salt, so it is absolutely inexhaustible.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing is the mystery of nature's coordination. What nature contains in abundance is not elemental sodium and elemental chlorine, because sodium cannot exist alone, nor is it other compounds of sodium and chlorine, but their own compound, salt. Of course, we can also extract salt from other compounds of chlorine and sodium, but it is troublesome after all, and it is definitely not as convenient as drying seawater. Furthermore, the properties of salt are similar to those of potassium chloride and not much different from those of magnesium chloride. However, what nature contains in abundance is not a large amount of potassium chloride or magnesium chloride, because potassium chloride has no taste, and magnesium chloride is too bitter to eat. Only delicious salt is especially convenient for people. Salt is dissolved in seawater and can be taken at any time. Of course, potassium chloride and magnesium chloride can replace salt, but if the salt on earth is replaced with magnesium chloride or potassium chloride, then people will lose many of their taste pleasures.</p>
<h3>New Treasures in the Sea</h3>
<p>— Sun Jialin</p>
<p>Many seaweeds grow in the ocean. These green and brown plants are of little use except for feeding cattle. In coastal areas, they are even an obstacle to navigation. British scientists have taken a fancy to it during this war, and the value of seaweed has been raised suddenly.</p>
<p>Seaweed can be used to make many substitutes, such as shiny silk underwear, shirts, socks, paper, cosmetics, rubber, furniture, plastics, and many other items. The uses are so wide that they cannot be exhausted.</p>
<p>After a long period of hard research, scientists have extracted Alginic Acid from seaweed. Once this substance is refined, it can obtain shiny rayon, which is strong and durable. When woven into cloth, it can be dyed and is not inferior to cotton yarn. Its advantages are that it is waterproof and fireproof. Even if it is soaked in kerosene and burned with fire, the oil will be exhausted and this substance will be intact.</p>
<p>Therefore, this new industry is about to develop, because seaweed is inexhaustible and inexhaustible. The vast ocean has become a rich source of raw materials. Just think, the area of the Sargaso Sea alone is 2.5 million miles, which exceeds all the wheat fields on the entire earth. It is no problem to collect tens of millions of tons.</p>
<p>In addition to industry, seaweed also has new uses in agriculture, because it contains a large amount of potassium, which is an indispensable fertilizer for plants. Therefore, Scotland and Ireland are now applying this seaweed fertilizer in large quantities. The war made Britain know the benefits of seaweed. These cheap and unlimited raw materials will inevitably become increasingly important.</p>
<p>This beautiful bryozoan is gregarious and can be used in painting. (Xi)</p>
<h3>Will Atoms Change?</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>Anyone with a little scientific knowledge knows that atoms can change, right? If atoms could not change, the atomic bomb could not have been invented at all, because the atomic bomb uses the fission characteristics of uranium. A neutron is used to hit the uranium atom, so that the uranium atom undergoes a chain reaction. Each uranium splits into three neutrons, releasing a large amount of latent energy, and the body changes into other elements. This is the most obvious example of the ability of atoms to change.</p>
<p>However, when we open chemistry books, the most basic Dalton's Atomic Theory says: An atom is the smallest particle that makes up matter; the same atoms that make up the same compound must have the same shape and weight; no atoms can be split, created, or destroyed.</p>
<p>In fact, we know that all three of these points are wrong: First, an atom is not the smallest particle that makes up matter. According to modern scientific knowledge, we know that electrons, protons, and neutrons are the smallest particles. Second, the shape and weight of the same atoms are not necessarily equal, because isotopes are proof. Take uranium as an example. Its isotopes include uranium-238 and uranium-234. If there were no isotopes, then the atomic weight would not have numbers after the decimal point.</p>
<p>As for the third point, it is more worthy of our discussion. Atoms can absolutely be split, created, and destroyed, which is also the foothold for our discovery of new elements. I might as well still take uranium as an example and look at its characteristics of splitting, creating, and destroying:</p>
<p>Uranium-238 can lose an Alfa particle and become uranium-234; it can then lose an Alfa particle and become a thorium element; it can also lose a second Alfa particle and become radium. Radium has a very long half-life, about 1690 years. It can conveniently allow radium to emit Alfa particles until it itself completely becomes a type of radium emanation (one of the rare gases), called Radon. At the same time, Radon can still continue to release Alfa and Beta particles and become lead. This process of a radioactive element splitting, destroying, and creating other elements naturally takes a very long time, but if we have a fully equipped laboratory, we can easily see this characteristic immediately.</p>
<p>Science is constantly evolving and changing with each passing day. People living in the 20th century atomic age should know that Dalton's atomic theory of 1804 is not entirely correct.</p>
<h3>Infrared Rays</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhi</p>
<p>Both infrared and ultraviolet rays are invisible because infrared rays have too long a radiation wavelength and ultraviolet rays have too short a radiation wavelength, so human eyes do not perceive them. However, in today's rapidly advancing science, clever scientists have turned them into visible things. Towards the end of World War II, American scientists finally used infrared rays to invent two new types of weapons: night vision scopes and night binoculars, which are suitable for night combat. It is said that these weapons were used during the US military's attack on Iwo Jima, causing significant damage to the enemy in the dark. These weapons work by emitting electrons through the action of infrared rays, and the electrons are then focused on a fluorescent screen through electronic lenses, thus creating an image. This is entirely an invention of electronics. However, recent research by several experts at the US General Electric Research Laboratory seems to have made further progress. It is said that adding a small piece of lead to zinc sulfide can make invisible infrared rays visible after exposure. This invention can simplify the devices of night vision scopes and night binoculars.</p>
<p>If infrared rays are used as signals, others cannot see them, but those with special devices can receive them. During World War II, the cutting of Pacific submarine cables, the sinking of the giant floating dock in Bergen Harbor, Norway, by the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer" and another Japanese battleship's small submarine in September 1944, and the North African landing operations all used them. In addition, the secret activities of underground workers, the escape of allies, and the crossing of the Rhine River at night all relied on infrared rays for guidance. Night combat by the air force also used infrared rays as signals. In amphibious warfare, infrared rays were the most miraculous form of communication between sea and land. Automatic weapons equipped with infrared automatic sights have also been invented, but due to the early end of the war, they have not been officially used on the battlefield.</p>
<p>There is also a sound-emitting electric light that is created using infrared rays. This method of using infrared rays for communication had already been applied to warfare by Germany and Japan during the war, but this method cannot be used for long distances. However, within a range of about ten miles, where military telephones or wireless telephones cannot be installed, this method of communication using infrared rays is applicable. However, their communication devices did not use cesium. Later, Dr. Beese of the United States designed it and realized that this metal is a very efficient infrared wave emitter, and at the same time is a poor illuminant, so there is no need to use a filtering device, and the signal will not be seen by others. It is said that this cesium vapor lamp using cesium, although not completed during the war, will appear soon.</p>
<p>In short, the progress of science is endless. As long as we can catch up and work hard on research, we will invent more ingenious and useful things.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Questions Stubborn Father Favors Sons Over Daughters Son Receives Thousands of Acres of Land for Wedding, Daughter Receives Nothing</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a twenty-one-year-old girl, now struggling under the extreme constraints of feudalism. My parents have two sons and one daughter, and from birth, they have favored sons over daughters, pampering their sons in every possible way while being extremely harsh to their daughters. My two older brothers have both received a university education. My eldest brother got married this summer with a lavish ceremony, and my father gave him thousands of acres of land and dozens of houses. My second brother also received the same property, while I, their daughter, received nothing. I am aware of my lack of knowledge and inability to support myself. Also, because I am unfamiliar with the law, I cannot argue reasonably. Now, I have several questions that I hope your newspaper's legal section can answer. I would be extremely grateful. Does an unmarried daughter have inheritance rights to her father's property? Is the father's method of distributing property to his sons in this way legal from a legal standpoint? What methods should the daughter use to deal with this? If the daughter is without fault, can the parents maliciously disown her? What crime would this constitute under the law? If the father passes away, can the daughter claim her rightful inheritance from her brothers? From reader Jiang Zeyuan</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (540) Yes. (Article 1138 of the Civil Code on Inheritance stipulates that, in addition to the spouse, direct lineal descendants are also included in the heirs of the estate. Therefore, sons and daughters have exactly the same inheritance rights to their father's property.) Impeding the allocation of the reserved portion of the estate is not legally compliant. A biological father cannot legally disown a daughter. Yes.</p>
