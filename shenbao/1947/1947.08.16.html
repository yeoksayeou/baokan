<h3>文武官員待遇調整　增加鹽稅准先實施　國務會通過李大明免職</h3>

<h3>張院長談調整特點　不患寡而患不均為原則　所有公職人員一視同仁</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕交武職人員待遇調整案，業經十五日國務會議通過。行政院張院長為此向中央社記者發表談話如次：</p>
<p>此次政府調整文武職公務國營事業人員之待遇辦法，係在不息寡而患不均之原則下，一方面顧念文武職公務員生活之艱苦，他方面考慮國庫負担之嚴重，經長期間之研討而形成本辦法之第一特點，即對於向較文職遠遜之武職人員待遇，二十年來屢擬作公平之調整，迄未實現者，今不顧種種困難，卒使文武職待遇歸於一致。</p>
<p>本辦法之第二特點，即對於向較文職公務員遠勝之國營事業人員待遇，數年來屢擬就規定限度核减，結果不僅未减，且變本加厲，轉有增益者，今亦不顧種種困難，使此項國營事業人負之待遇，减至原規定之優待限度以內。文武職人員官俸不同，其待遇原難一致，此次為特別增加武職人員之待遇，遂將武職人員分別按其特，簡，荐，委之階級，比照文織特，簡，存，委各級之官俸，惟文職無主副食及眷糧之供應，武職有之，為求文武一致，自應就武職調整後之待遇，除此項主副食費，並將眷糧取消。經過此項調整後，武職官佐實得之待遇，較前平均增加一倍。至於士兵方面，除副食費增至每人每月六萬元外，其應得之餉，比照　節底數分別增加，計上中下士增至一萬倍，上等兵一萬二千倍，一二等兵增至一萬五千倍，底數愈低者，增加愈多，二等兵經此夫調整後，所得薪餉恰等於調整以前之倍數，總計由於文武一致待遇所為之調整，對於武職官佐及士兵，每月合增薪餉二千三百零八億元，為數實已甚鉅。</p>
<h3>八月份調整數　每人普加十萬</h3>
<p>政府旣決心實現文武待遇一致之目標，因而國庫所增負祖極鉅，對於八月份文職人員待邁之調整，已無餘力，加以文武人員待遇旣一致，今後文職人員之待遇有所調整，武職人員自不得不作同樣之調整。因此八月份之調整更感困難，惟政府鑒於文職公務員生活之痛苦，數月以來物價亦有相當增漲，此次若不調整，將使文職公務人員尤其薪俸較低之公務人員，不得維持其生活，經再三考慮，不得已僅就每人所得之基本數酌加調整，計各區每月均增十萬元。此數看似不多，就今女武職及省級人員計算祇此一項，已增國庫之又出每月不下一千三百五十六億元（中央速省級八百廿億元，武職五百卅六億元）。</p>
<p>此外，更連帶作兩項之措施：其一，文職公務人員之待遇，向採生活指數之高下，分為五區，差別較大，此次締為四區，按各地生活指數重新新調整編列，其因原第五區取消而遞升至第四區，或由原第四，第三，第二各區遞升至第三，第二，第一區者，除基本數普增之每人十萬元外，尙可因分區之遞升，原有基本數及薪俸增倍數亦有遞推。（未完）</p>

<h3>張治中在新致詞　警告伊犂人士　政府　決維護全疆完整</h3>
<p>〔中央社迪化十四日電〕張治中今於馬良　乙任新疆監察使典禮會上，以間接語調，警告休閒鞋犂方面人士稱：「　央政府已將一切權利交給新疆人民，然必須確保領土主權之完整。政府必不能放棄此塊土地與全疆人民，若有人欲掽毀此一原則，導引新疆走上另一途要，乃絕不可能之事，永不可能之事，其結果必將全疆人民推上毀滅之路」。渠穏稱：「余在疆一年餘，所推行之和平政策，可知中央政府對新疆之眞實態度，而全疆人民今日所渴望者，亦為和平建設，而非戰爭態度，而全疆人民今日所渴望者，亦為和平建設，最近吐魯番善善托克遜發生之有組織之暴動，即其說明。此種反和平之思想，必非新疆人之思想、中國人之思想。」按自五月廿八日伊犂方面拒絕承認麥斯武德出任新省主席後，伊方人員陸續撤離迪化，十二日晨阿合買提汪（副省主席）復飛返伊犂，新疆之統一，已成嚴重問題。</p>

<h3>京中和橋慘案開審　昨上下午傳訊登人十名　案情已有眉目今日續審</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕首都中和橋美兵拋我空軍士兵下水溺斃案，十五日晨在隸志社由美軍事法庭開審，本定賽凡尼。阿多瑞兩人同時受　，後徇被告辯護人衛斯之請，先審阿多瑞，上下午共傳訊中外證人十名，對案情已略有眉自，十六日將讀傳訊。</p>
<p>旁廳卒無虛席</p>
<p>今日審訊美兵，在復員以來之首都尚屬首次，中外人士或極注視，前往旁聽者極衆，座無盧席，外部美洲司長董霖，司法行政部刑事司長倪徽　，首都地院首席檢察官陳光處等，咸蒞臨觀審。八時許，審判長茂　上校，審判官格瑞應利，檢察官甘台等，次第步入中懸星條旗之法庭，被害人家屬葛發田生母汪氏，葛伯父葛有繼，王守本父母王國華·王李氏，坐於旁聽席上，時時拭淚，與作證者談此事慘狀，無何，被告阿多瑞，賽凡尼押入，審判乃正式開始，時為八時半。</p>
<p>檢察官述案情</p>
<p>宣誓等手續完畢後，被告辯護人衛斯提請審判官麥梯斯廻避，由另一審判言補入，仍維持九人之數。檢察官甘台宣讀起訴各款，　護人提出動議，請求先審阿多瑞，庭上臨時閉庭考慮此事，決議准如所請，賽凡尼退出，先詢阿多瑞。首由檢察官陳遠案情，說明阿多瑞有意非法將主守本•葛發田推入水中淹斃情形，繼即聽取證人口證。最先被傳者有德蘭因上尉，渠爲被告上司，答復關於捕獲被告之經過。次爲美軍刑事偵察組負責人，報告勘察出事地點情形，攝影師湯麥師亦出庭，報告就地攝影經過，許怕特則說明繪製中和橋詳　情形，最後並有一對航行有經騐之人員，說明中和橋水流緩急深淺情形。上述五人作證時，檢察官出示照片及地圖，訊問極詳，被告辯護人亦提疑問，殊見審愼仔細。</p>
<p>十一時一刻，休息五分鐘後，擬傳與阿多瑪熟識之中國憲兵程朝宗，程當塲指出肇事之阿多瑞，對當晚阿等駕車入飛機塲之情形，答覆極詳，檢察官反覆盤駁，並一再告其須說實話，渠據實作答，回復「你作什要職業時」，並大聲謂「我爲中華民國憲兵」，予人印象極佳。</p>
<p>證人窮於應對</p>
<p>次傳目　美兵將王守本拋入水中之空軍機械士涂崇海，渠當時險亦爲美兵拋入河中，爲本案最主要證人之一，由於中外法律習慣不同，加之涂程度似又較差，未正式訊問，雙方爲程序問題爭辯頗久，涂對當時王•葛二人被拋入河中情形，報告極詳，檢察官並以地圖令渠指出肇事地點，渠亦當塲指出，惟被告辯護人仍多方挑剔，故作詭辯，使知識有限且不明西洋語法之涂崇海窮於應對。十二時許再度休庭。</p>
<p>午後二時許，讀詢涂崇海，辯護人對涂是否認識王守本，何以知死者即王，何以知推王入水者即阿多瑞，詢問不厭其詳，並以鉛筆爲例，多方盤詰，對涂是否目擊王被推入水，亦詳爲詢問，雖經涂一一就所知答覆，然辯護人以涂前後答言有出入，聲明在涂證言中未能獲知王係被拋，被推入水，抑自行投水，對其他各點，亦表懷疑。涂爲本案最主要證人之一，故先後傳訊在一小時以上。</p>
<p>同車美兵證詞</p>
<p>次復傳詢與　多瑞一同乘車出遊之美兵許拉特，許供，阿曾於當晚於俱樂部翁來時，將一坐於中和橋頭之　人舉起，拋入河中，當時僅一人走下吉普，並說明舉起時，該華人一手被彎至背後，另一手亦遭拗轉，當時未作反抗，另一華人則　去。另一美兵派克亦供阿推一華人入水，惟對當時彼此曾作何語，則謂無從記憶。</p>
<p>最後詢當晚値班之美憲兵蘭恩，渠當晚會接阿多瑞電話，於電話中可辯別　已酒醉，據告庭上，渠來接電話前，曾於機塲中語阿，阿時已酒醉，走路蹣　，並曾以手推證人之　。詢問至下午四時一刻，以時間已遲，改十六日晨續審。</p>
<p>今日審訊，一般而論，尚可滿意，美方法律程序之局密，檢察官辯護人之多方盤駁，不厥其詳，尤値欽佩，惟傳訊中國證人時，强　西洋習俗，而審判官等對中國一般知議又感欠缺，對審判進行及將來判決不無影響，似爲憾事。</p>
<h3>唐縱招待新聞界　參觀刑事試騐室</h3>

<h3>社論　瞻念我國的學術前途</h3>
<p>北平研究院　學研究所所長嚴濟慈氏日前向報界談稱：「我國原子能之研究，現方開始，以言北平，研究所同人，規均集中精力於此一專題……研究員錢三强，在法國發現原子核新分裂法，物理學權威若利歐等，均推崇備至；所方亦未便促其返國，蓋我國之研究設備，自不能如歐洲各研究所完善也」。爲什麼研究人員「未便」促其返國呢？這是說明學術研究人員一旦回國，便可能失去研究的工具和塲所。</p>
<p>本報駐平記者通訊，報告故都敎育的危難，說：「今日談敎育，大家幾乎已無暇顧及制度，師資，設備，每日困難着先生學生的僅剩了生活問題」。其實，這不僅在北平是如此，這成了全國普遍的現象。</p>
<p>誰都知道學術是建國的重心，沒有學術，國家便無法列於强大國家之林，可是學術的建設是最費時間的，沒有研究的工具和學人的長期努力，便很難有所成就，英美蘇諸國在軍備方面固然競爭，即在學術研究方面也同樣地勾心鬥角。所以戰後各國的敎育及學術研究，都無日不在進步之中。而國家在這方面所支出的預算，也極其龐大。然而戰後我國學術研究的情形如何？僅看看上述二節新聞的報道，巳足够人憂心如焚了。</p>
<p>我國研究院較之英美法蘇諸國，本極幼稚，規模較大的中央研究院，年來因戰事播遷，至今原氣未復，至於各大學的研究所，其內容大半空虛。科學研究原是一點一滴的累積，決不能希望一朝一夕有所成功，更不能如工商業的投資，希望在某一時期內便可獲得利潤。因此，在今日一急功近利」的社會裏，學術研究便被一般人所忽視或輕視。從業人員的生活，朝不保夕，他們和大多數公敎人員一樣在　棧上掙扎，其幼苗缺乏雨露的滋潤，而日夕在盛夏的　　度　頭，能不枯　以死，便算萬幸了。</p>
<p>學術研究的廣大工作人員，原是大學裏的敎授。說起來眞可憐，現在敎授都快要成爲　學了；許多人爲生活打算早已「改業」。忠實虔誠的工作者，早　開門七件事壓倒了，許多人因營養不足，工作繁重而失去了　憲，一位任敎三十年以上的權威學者，部聘敎授，在外國至少可以「衣食無憂」，但不幸在今日的中國，他還得協助夫人共同料　家庭　務。連女工都雇用不起，一位任教二十年以上的教授，有一次他出席學術講演會遲到了，立起來致歉，說：「太太前幾天生了孩子，我家裏的什麼事都得做，因爲兼了女工的差，所以遲到，實在十分抱歉！」大學高級敎授的待遇已相當於文官簡任，武人將官，但他們的生活郤艱苦到這般地步，你呌他們怎樣能够有寗靜的心境來談學術？社會上有人責備敎授不好好指導學生研究）學問，實在太不公平！在這種情形之下，著作物自然大是極其平庸的，即使有專著的學術論文，也很少有人購買，書坊家爲「成本」打算，也很難出版，所以今日出版界中能有獲本比較有學術重量的書！本年度敎育部發表的三十四年度學術審議會的學術著作及發明獎金頭等是八十萬，二等是四十萬，三等是二十萬，頭等獎現在買不到一套舊西裝，二等獎買不到一雙較好的皮鞋，三等獎買不到二趨五磅的奶粉，中國的學術不値錢到這樣地步！敎授爲生活計，祗好把研究學問的時間抽出，親自上街買買菜與小商人攤販們吵吵價錢，或在家裏抱抱小孩子，以節省開支。研究的時間便完全被剝奪了。這種情形，京滬一帶敎授容或有差可兼，狀况較好，內地各省的敎授，却習以爲常了。</p>
<p>上面已經提起學術研究需要有長久的時間，因為設備和人才都不是短時間所能辦到的，他的工作有如「水之養石」，研究員和敎授是領導者，他們一面要培養自己，一面還得培養衆多優秀的大學生，以爲繼起的人員。但現在的大學生情形如何呢？打開窗子說亮話，今日大學生的程度和研究學問的興趣，都比戰前降低了！這不能完全怪靑年，實在領導研究的敎授太少，何况工具缺乏，生活成問題。因此靑年人大多數都充滿了煩惱和苦悶，能够翻翻敎科書抄抄筆記本的，便算是用功的學生了。然而肚會上一部份人祗認得幾個字，鑽營鑽營，或能够記記賬，跑跑生意的，却「高官駟馬，」或「豐衣足食，」機關用人也很少以人材爲主義，「選賢任能」祗是考試院高掛在那裏的匾額，一般社會現狀如此，靑年人是敏感的，易受暗示的，富有模仿性的，他們了解了今日的社會，還有多少人肯注意學術，能够「特立獨行」而不爲社會惡勢力所侵蝕？這眞是學術前途莫大的隱憂。</p>
<p>學術研究機關的空虛如此，在國外研究的科學家一旦回國，工作便發生困難，研究的人員在饑餓錢上受苦難，如此下去，我們到什麼時候才能趕上英美法蘇的科學研究，膽念我國學術前途，實令人憂心如焚，徹夜無眠！</p>

<h3>劉虎長等離滬　金都案臨時奉命移京審理　受押憲警十九名夜起解</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金都戲院　發網突血案之審　許審突然發生變化，原定昨晨九時半舉行之會審，臨時停止。軍法處劉處長，偕檢察科包科長，軍法官孟慶泰，書記官馬政祥等四人，淸晨七時乘京滬綫凱旋號快車離滬。據本報今晨南京電：劉務曾處長昨午一時抵京後告記者，「金都案原定十五日會審，因臨時奉到最高當局指示，全案移京審理。本人對全案眞相已全部明瞭，認爲警憲雙方均應負相當責任，至孰經孰重，尚需待會審後始能決定」。下午八時劉處長晋見秦德純次長報會全案偵訊經過。至覊押警備部看守所中之憲兵十一名，警察八名，已於十五日晚十一時半，由警備部特務連第二排排長陳道新率士兵廿名押解，乘夜車赴京受審。</p>
<h3>行總邀監署地檢處　澈查貪汚疑案究竟　霍署長定今日發表事實眞相</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總六高級職員被檢舉消息露布後行總發，言人昨夜告本報記者，「行總已正式邀請監察使署及地檢處派人澈查，以明眞相。」霍寳樹署長昨日本定於午後六時發表一「事實眞相」之書面報告，嗣因時間匆促，不及準備，改於今日發表。昨日霍署長曾先發表一書面談話，全文如下：「行總之工作，無不可公開之事。舉凡名有關金錢物資之處理，除國府主計處派有會計人員經常駐署辦理一切賬目外，凡物資之分配，運輸，售賣，管理，每一處理階段，均伕據條約，與聯總會商辦理，並有外籍職員參加本署各部門實際工作。由於一切業務在條約及政府規章之約束下進行，余個入始敢於對全署之事負全部責任。報章所載不負責任之密報消息刋出後，各該被誣高級職員，已向余請求澈查。現調查程序正在進行中，本署歡迎有關監察機關來署調查，以便公開一切事實。個人認爲在是非混淆之情况下，爲公服務。實非易事。尤以行總即將結束之際，欲維持忠實之優秀幹部繼續工作，極爲困難。希望法律及社會公論對忠實服務之公務員，予以保證及同情。至於不負責任之密告，如事實證明其爲惡意誣蔑，本署自有權追訴。」</p>
<p>又據副署長李卓敏對各報記者表示：一切對彼個人之控訴，均無根據。不久以前監察院對其居所之「窮奢極慾」一節，已查明不確。其住宅固甚寬敞，但爲敵產管理局所配給，與前署長蔣廷黻共同居住者。過去彼曾親自批定凡聯總運來之物資，任何高級職員不得借用，目前仍本此原則而行。但彼認爲此次控訴，事出有因，故對據舉人所披露之綫索，當遂步予以澈查。</p>
<p>又記者昨晤行總發言人鮑光照，據談稱：『雷扇出售之事，一切與聯總人員會同辦理，如屬有弊，華府將先披露。此事在兩週前，已由監院查明不確。總務處長汽車不止三部，但為公事車，備同事出善使用者。李卓敏之居所，前為蔣署長官邸，霍長就任後未搬入。各地分署署長來滬時，亦黨寄寓於此，不啻為一招待所。閔箱兩隻，原　於汪逆官邸，故今日仍為國家之財產，收回使用，亦有理可據。行總對本案今日已正式邀請監察使署及地檢處派人澈查，以明究竟矣。」</p>
<h3>嚴監察使　重視密告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總副署長李卓敏等六人，被人向監察使署，地檢處密告貪污一事，自報章揭載後，各方咸加重視。昨日據嚴監察使語記者稱：監察使署向不受理匿名密告。該案告密人留有眞實姓各與詳細地址，本署對此案因此極爲重視，現正調查中。若所檢舉各節屬實。本署決依法嚴辦。其刑事責任部份應歸地檢處偵查。且謂：在全案未調查明瞭前，本人不擬有所表示。</p>
<p>黃首檢談話</p>
<p>昨走訪地檢處首席檢察官黃亮，對行總副署長李卓敏等被密告貪汚事有所詢問。據黃首席稱：「數日前曾接得密告信一封，內容與報載者相似，因未具名，且又未附有證據，故未積極偵查」。記者詢問：「如招商局申請配給電風扇事，行總配出數與招商局配得數是否相符一點，可否作爲偵查之憑據」？黃首席稱：「僅憑一紙密告，即向兩機關調查，似有未便。惟如附有確實證據，如賬册照片等，當可據以偵查。總之，本處對於貪汚案件，至爲注意，如有負責人具名告發，幷附有證件，本處責職所在，無不偵查之理，今可奉告者，惟此而已」。</p>
<h3>行總車不行　米貼不發　悟機能怠工</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日馬路上未見行總之交通車，據悉係因未能如數發薪，致全體可機聯合怠工所致。惟行總某高級職員於晚間表示：「因領米貼之手續，一時未能辦好，故米貼未能與工資同時發放。司機不滿，故有怠工表示。但至午後四時，司機已回汽車房，此項糾紛諒巳解決。」</p>

<p>被俘匪軍中之最年幼者（本報攝）</p>
<h3>東北匪軍俘獲解滬　今日赴漢繼續受訓　對政府厚待表示感奮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕年來國軍在東北陸續俘獲匪軍官兵甚夥，當局特成立東北靑年訓導總隊，下設十二個大隊，予以訓練，統稱為青訓學員。其中第四·第九兩大隊學員共一·八〇〇人，由憲兵六團三營押運，尚陽乘車到達葫蘆島，即晚搭招商局「海宙」輪來滬，於前晚駛抵吳淞口，昨日中午停泊虬江碼頭，今日換乘「江新」輪後，即駛</p>
<p>被迫為匪·佔最多數</p>
<p>該輪停泊時，全體學員齊集甲板上，觀望四週風景，面呈欣慰之色。據該兩隊負責人談稱：渠等半數爲東北籍，其他各省籍者亦有，其被俘來源，有作戰時投誠者，有原係國軍爲共匪俘去　又爲國軍俘獲尚未證實者，有在各城市查獲爲匪軍之間諜者，有原係僞軍反正後爲匪軍俘去作戰者，有原為普通良民經匪軍解放淸算後無以爲生被迫爲匪者，其中以後者占量多數，該第四大隊中，大部爲軍官，自少尉至於少校。</p>
<p>遭受清算·家產蕩然</p>
<p>在瀋陽受訓已有數月，每人不分階級均配給與國軍同等之待週，每月並發東北流通券三千元，合國幣三萬四千五百元作爲零用。渠等經此數月訓練，對於國家觀念已有眞切認識，思想俱有轉變。俟到漢口後，再繼續施以訓練，將來如何補充，裝備，均由武漢行營負責指揮。另據學員王漢文·朱慶富稱：渠等在九一八後被迫爲僞軍，經反正後在家開設豆粉廠，頗具規模，八路軍到東北後，家產即遭淸算，家人俱遭匪害，個人被迫作戰，此次被俘，深謝政府諒解厚遇，今後願在國軍中服務，返回東北剿滅匪類。</p>

<h3>禁舞消息傳出　職工大感徬徨　舞業理事長表示　甯恢復過云稅率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自當局公佈下月起將實施有條件禁舞之消息傳出後，舞廳業及樂師，舞業職工方面均擬於日內分別召開會議，並向當局有所建議。　現本市舞廳業職工計三千餘人，據職工工會代表談：彼等組織工會之初，本係沿用一西菜咖啡業職業工會」名稱，後因社會局鄭重表示，舞業於短期，內決不禁止，始改「舞廳業職工工會」名稱，現得禁舞消息，咸感徬徨。彼等現在舞廳內皆充侍應職務，將來禁舞果如期實施，則祗有向西菜店咖啡館轉業，惟目前西菜咖啡館之營業十九均仰賴舞女舞客之光顧，一旦禁舞，則原有侍應員工均將發生問題，彼等自更有失業之虞，故深望當局能考慮及此。</p>
<p>有關商店均將影響</p>
<p>舞廳業同業公會理事長孫洪元表示禁舞原意爲推行節約，但全市數千舞女並無其他技術，將來如流爲娼妓及「交際花」，徒造成舞廳以外之嫖賭浪費，並不能達到節約目的。現妓院尚未明令禁絕，反先消滅舞塲，似未免捨本逐末。因直接依賴舞塲爲生之數千職工，若以每人須贍養家屬三人計，則全市將有數萬人生活無依，何况間接與舞業有關之時裝店，理髮業，皮鞋業，娛樂業等，甚至三輪車未，亦將蒙受極大影響。</p>
<p>與其禁絕不如加稅</p>
<p>目前舞廳所繳捐稅佔本市財政收入重要部份，與其完全禁絕，不若將現在稅率百分之廿五改訂，恢復從前百分之四十或五十，以示限制，似反於本市之財政狀况，有所裨益。若謂跳舞消耗物資太鉅，但舞　消後必將改營西菜咖啡館等，對電力及某他一切似亦未必即能節約。故當局果欲禁舞，則對此種問題均應顧到。</p>
<p>再樂師公會方面亦將於十九日開會商討。現各樂師中頗有爲新近畢業之音專學生，彼等表示所習本爲音樂，如舞塲不能存在，至其他地方演奏亦可生活，因目前待遇微薄，無論外籍及華籍樂師均已對舞廳演奏深感厭倦也。</p>

<h3>行總總署辦公廳內　武劇　福利組主任被歐傷　控訴總務處長越權</h3>

<h3>警政劃時代進步　運用科學方法　偵查犯罪證據　紫外光是最有力的一種</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕自槍殺余盛孝一案爲警局以「紫外光」騐定犯罪證據後，外間對最近警局用以破案之各種科學方法，甚感興趣。記者特走訪警局刑事處負責人，得知目前罪犯之偵查，及蹬據之鑑定，已完全廢棄刑訊而改用各種最新科學方法從事研訊，務使罪犯在科學之威力前俯首認罪，無法飾辯。</p>
<p>紫外光即係其中最有效之一種，專用以偵查各種目力所不能及之細微罪證，如偽造文書印鑑，僞造鈔票，冒製商品等。因紫外光完全根據光學透視之原理，雖屬巧奪天工刻意亂眞之贋品，或毁跡滅形無法辨認之原體，均可在此超强度光綫下分別鑑定。市上當牌白蘭地酒如以紫外光與眞貨對照透視，其濃度，成分，液形之　別，眞僞立辨。日前市銀行被僞　支票印鑑冒領巨款之假印三方，亦係由紫外光騐出，其與原印鑑之異點僅在一二處刀痕剡跡之間，單憑肉眼絕不能看出。</p>
<p>根據指紋　尋出綫索</p>
<p>與紫外光有聨帶關係之指紋檢定，更為警局偵查工作中最繁重之一環。目前該處指紋股留有十指紋六十餘萬頁，單指紋十餘萬只，俱爲工部局時代以來歷年積存之罪犯指印，式曾在出事塲所拓留後尚未破案者。如前次轟動滬上之泰山公寓　屍案，及何應欽公館失竊案等，均在數日內取數小時內藉該項指紋尋得綫宗，而終於破獲。現全部指紋依照美國最新分類方法予以分析歸，由專家管理。如有案件發生，為明瞭犯罪者係初犯或積犯，或須與現塲所留指印對照，常致反覆翻專，循類型以與檔內指紋比較，耗時最多。</p>
<p>立體照相　無形照相</p>
<p>偵查過程中照相工作亦頗重要。一案發生後，無論罪犯，現塲，文書，證物，均須攝照留存。警局現有「立體照相及「無形照相」二種，其設備在遠東爲首屈一指。所謂「立體照相」，係用以拍攝正面以外之各種角度者，「無形照相」則可使所需拍攝之一點，特別淸晰，其餘部份均在拍攝時自動隱滅。此種照相於研訊罪犯或探求綫索時，常爲最有力之帮助。</p>
<p>檢查彈彀　可知槍主</p>
<p>上海現經登記之自衛槍械共此種槍枝均由第三科騐槍股留有記錄。因同一牌號之槍枝，其構造上均有些微差異，故倘使市內有槍擊案發生，根據檢獲之彈頭，視其經過來復綫之深淺闊狹，或檢查其彈殼上撞針痕跡，斷定被撞擊位置之上下左右，然後用最精密之計算方法，與原記錄中來復綫之迴旋度及撞針之位置互相核對，槍主爲雄，立可確定。</p>
<p>毛髪血跡　俱可檢驗</p>
<p>此外該處尚附有法醫室，專專檢騐毛髪，血跡屍體，傷痕，以與前述請種科學方法配台，綜合鑑定犯罪者之容貌，性格以及其犯罪之經過。</p>
<p>以科學方法偵查罪行，爲中國警政劃時代之進步，市警局正謀充實此種科學設備，爲做到毋枉毋縱而努力，將來犯罪行爲在科學之威力前，必可逐漸减少。</p>

<h3>無聲的牯嶺</h3>
<p>白雲繚繞　萬仞山山十一日訊〕從熱騰騰的首都攀登到這萬仞高山來，在白雲繚繞之中，我們嗅不到一點政治的氣息，聽不到半聲市塵的暄囂，看不到一粒飛揚的塵土，大有「乘風歸去」之感！</p>
<p>「長恨春歸無覓處，不知轉人此中來，」（白樂天詩句）寫結　之曼是再恰當不過的了，在這裏，記者祗想約略的介紹一點山中雜訊，算是揭開了無聲的廬山面目：</p>
<p>山民長望　主席來</p>
<p>牯嶺偈是已成為一個歷史性的政治性的夏都的名稱了，戰前的廬山集訓，廬山會議，乃至蔣主席的廬山廣播，都是中國近百年史上的大事，牯嶺的居民，永遠以此爲榮，永遠在回憶着當年的這些盛况。戰後的去年，爲了蔣主席的平日命駕蒞臨，以及和平特使馬歇爾的週末來去，都曾吸引了京滬各報記者廿餘人長川駐牯，每天都想在這溫靜的山巓發出驚動世界的電訊，而冠蓋往來，濃烈的政治氣息嘰乎把溫馨的估嶺擾得過度熱烈緊張起來，牯嶺。雖然在今春遭遇了大火的浩刧，但是他們依然元憧憬着比去年更熱烈的塲面的出現。「主席幾時上廬山來？」之聲，不絕於耳。可是當七月終了的時候他們開始歎息起來，「主席怕不會來了吧。」記者是八月七日方上山，一進山門，就不斷的答覆着一些相識與不相識的人羣的詢問「主席幾時來？「同時更聽着他們五相在說「怕沒有希望了」，「怕不會來了」，山民期待主席的蒞臨，如同期待他們慈母一樣，然而今天已經是八月十一日了，這個希望的可能性巳經减少到不能再少的程度了。</p>
<p>風吼澗鳴　話官邸</p>
<p>主席的富邸，靜靜的臨着溪水　立在那兒，圍牆裏面屋子前面是一大塊草地，山民指着告訴我，去年他們可以很榮幸的視　蔣主席和他美美麗的夫人在這草地上散步，他們用文字力量以外極生動的形容詞，來敍述他們對主席夫婦一舉一動的親切感覺，可是，現在只落得冷淸淸的，除前後門各站，個憲兵守衛外，什麼聲音都聽不到。主席這所官邸的位置非常好，面前是大道，背後是迤延的曲徑，而流水淙淙，正從牆脚而過，夜半醒來，眞是風吼澗鳴，一脈淸澄的詩意中帶着雄壯的意味。</p>
<p>焚餘灰燼　賦新生</p>
<p>今春的一了牯嶺，一直到今天我們仍到處可見斷墻殘垣的遺址，大火燬去牯嶺的部份精華，但是，就爲了他具有着這一點政治上的價値，他又復興了，他又再造了，於是廢墟又重賦了新的生機，政府當局以及商賈自身都設法投出大量的資本，把他重建起來，而負責招待嘉賓的贛省府方面，尤其竭力設法，以去年爲例，加借的改善今年的設備，廬山管理局局長吳仕漢社會服務處總幹事王烱光，都早早登山設計籌劃。社會服務處還特地租了一幢大屋子，裏面種臺亭閣式的寓樓，以及食堂，理髮室，浴室，圖書室，一應俱全，給與旅客不少方便，去年的記者　中地是胡金芳飯店，雖然那也是有着九十個房間的大旅館，　是今年已經遜色不少。記者們已移轉到社會服務處的社會公寓來了。今年夏都的一切，較去年更爲改進。</p>
<p>神經中樞　感靈敏</p>
<p>馬歇爾將軍云年在廬山時曾經說過這麼一句話：「牯嶺的電信，將是世界首屈一指的，」但是馬歇爾將軍如果今年再度蒞臨，他也許會歎爲觀止吧？一個長途電話，只要叫過兩分鐘就叮叮可的響着鈴子來了，聲音淸晣綫路多，而有綫電，無綫電各色俱備，其辦事的迅速與認眞，使人感到佩眼。郵件也都傳遞迅速，郵局設備都是超等的，郵務人員對鄉人寄信，都經常負責指導，這些，可設是牯嶺的神經中樞。</p>
<p>牯嶺已經呈現着一片秋色了，夏天在無聲中消逝了。這正象徵着今年的夏都之現實。</p>
<h3>台省氣象局局長談　構建新高山氣象臺　以研究太陽為中心課題</h3>
<p>〔本報台北十五日電〕氣象局長石延漢偕技正黃仁煜實地視察新高山氣象台並勘察前“人所築天文台舊址後，渠稱：除却印度，墨西哥外，天文台大都設於北溫帶，若於此間亞熱一帶構設，具有下列優點：（一）可目擊南極天球恒星。（二）地平綫上無陣礙象。（三）廉埃稀少，觀察氣球無閃爍缺點。（四）可觀察是數較平地增二倍半。渠又強調稱：該台可以太陽爲其研究中心課題，如觀察太陽黑點，日射能强度，同時建築愛因斯坦塲，研究太陽成份，因該台地處北回歸錢，以海拔較高，可以獲致其他天文台所不易獲得之結論。渠已進備提交九月舉行之本屆天文學年會，希以國家之力量建設目前新高山氣象臺。</p>

<h3>合肥一幕趣劇　夏英林官癮難熬　潛印「局長」名片</h3>
<p>剪講大批衣料滿擬走馬上任　即被察破實情押入警局訊辦</p>
<p>〔本報合肥訊〕今日合肥發生一趣劇，傳遍平淡之古城。有夏英林者，合肥人，廿六歲，在十字街一布店購大批衣料，店夥剪包後，夏聲言即將接任省會警察局局長，並取出同長全銜待所，該剛警以值勤時間，又未聞局長有調動之說，乃不置理，　竟賞以耳光，崗警一時莫明其妙，遂將夏誘至附近第一分局，報告分局長賴挺，賴挺見夏身穿半舊襯衣，着短褲，絕不似一行將上任之局長，且無比項消息，經搜尋在夏身邊發現「安徽省會警察局局長夏英林」名片數十張，及通知新聞記者函告以「訂於八月X日上午X時在警局大禮堂舉行新舊局長交代典禮」，並有「奉李主席之令，長理省會警察局局長之職，受命之餘，不勝惶恐之至」等語。賴分局長遂將夏送至刑警隊，轉送總局。記者至總局拘留所探視此一冒牌局長，木柵內地板上，即有一穿背心褲頭者站起，並急忙穿上嶄新黃皮鞋，似有靈感，首說：「我是夏英林，你是不是新聞記者」？旋自述身世，做過打字員文書，最近曾代理蕪湖第三分局長，詢其是否警界出身，與蕪湖警局　局長有何關係，答稱：小學尚朱畢業，與盧根本不認識。至於來至合肥，係因省府常會通過發表為省會警局長，原任局長林超則發表爲縣長，故到肥印即好名片，記者告以省府絕無此項命令發表，夏似恍然有悟，言語之間，東拉西扯，毫無倫次，癲癲傻傻，酷類患神經病者。聞警局現正調查其來歷，再行決定發落。</p>

<p>〔本報北平十五日電敎育部長朱家驊，今在平，被師院要求復大學生包圍，受窘一小時，結果乘機由旁門避去。下午四時，師院學生二百餘人，秘密結集於北大，待朱家驊於四時半視察北大理學院發覺，爲時已晚，在方志懋秘書百般計誘下，仍被學生包圍，於甫將登車之時，學生阻於汽車前，要求必　講話，而予復大要求保證後，始允登車。在車旁相特十餘分鐘，學生喊出甚不禮貌，强調指出朱氏不講話爲官僚架子，朱氏狀甚不快，終無法突出重圍，而返校內。學生追蹤之下，並呼「盡死，仍求復大」！北大人員雖數度企圍誘致學生於旁室，終無效果。如此直至最後院落，朱部長避人物理系辦公室，但學生情緒激昂，朱部長終於出外，對學生訓話稱：「余非不願與汝等談話，實感覺此等方式欠佳，要談公事應預先約定時間與地方，復大問題已與師院校長郝任夫（津敎育局長）約好，明晚即在師院元與學生代表交換意見，而後再談此事，應平心靜氣研究。敎部有行政法規，非余可擅自決定。」至此，學生高呼要最後的決定答覆。時北大胡校長聞報趕至，乃出面解圍。胡稱：師院復大，我以校友（胡曾就讀於以前之高等師範）立塲，關心已久，且曾代為斡旋，一月前轉朱部長信於師院，當時朱部長信中曾表示同情，自紙黑字，當可邀信。（朱胡與學生皆稱所欠者，即程序問題，方針是定了，惟朱部長不能明曰表示而已）。此時方秘　與北大人員全體出動，各覓學生代表，以「各個擊破」方式，說服代表。學生不滿意，要朱胡二氏作肯定保證，胡於無可奈何下，點頭，朱氏不肯，再呈僵局。胡氏乃一馬當先，引導朱氏衝出，學生則將門緊閉，朱胡兩氏頗有怒意，而無辦法再回室內。少頃，胡氏復出外與學生局旋，學生要求請胡轉部長，請其簽字保證，明晚去師院，即可退出，胡氏怒謂：「你們提這樣要求，真是下流，我一地主，如何能作此失禮之事，應考慮，幸勿失去同情者的同情。這種方式，我都怕了，何况朱部長。」時學生發覺朱部長在胡適博士金蟬脫殼計下，自旁門避去，只好由學生代表，與胡氏握手作保證，相率退出，時已五時過半。</p>

<h3>橡膠工業原料不足　建議三項緊急處置　寬放限額變列進出口貿易辦法　如自求僑匯應儘先核發許證</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第一區橡膠工業同業公會爲原料短絀，輸入限額有限，生產艱困，特於昨日招待本市新聞界，由該會理事長洪念祖及常務理事等，分別報告該業現狀。據談：自當局實施輸入管理制度以來，上海各橡膠廠分配額，僅得到橡膠二千六百餘噸，而本年上半年由香港輸人我國之橡膠，達十五萬担（約合一萬噸）。此中轉口上海者，約佔十之七八。故上海橡膠業之生產與供應，方得無缺。茲自本年七月一日起，實施禁止轉口令後，港粵貨運不通，而第三季橡膠及製品限額，又减少美金五十萬元。化學品及其他原料，更無到手。無原料，工廠工人俱不能繼續生存。故近特上呈行政院，全國經委會，經濟部，工商輔導處，及輸管曾等有關機關，建議緊急措置三項：（一）實放原料生橡膠及化學品等限額。（二）變更進出口貿易辦法，請准各廠按實需，直接申請進口，或由公會共同辦理。（三）工廠實需原料，能自尋求僑匯，儘先核發許可證。置後並謂，如再不許各橡膠工廠自尋生機，則三個月後，將紫睹枯魚之市云云。</p>
<p>台灣橡膠廠原料亦不足</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨日第一區橡膠公會招待席上，資委會台灣橡膠廠沈廠長亦列席。沈氏力陳橡膠工業與國防工業及平時工業之利害關係，並呼籲政府分配限額，不應將台灣摒棄在外。渠旋報告台灣橡膠業近况，謂該地共有橡膠工廠五十餘家，惟台灣橡膠廠之機器人力，已佔全台橡膠工業百分之六十。該廠月需橡膠三百六十噸至四百噸，現實際僅能月得卅噸，不足需要量十三分之一。以台灣工業生產條件之優良，政府實應予以全力扶植云。</p>
<h3>中途由穏轉疲　華股起伏靡定</h3>

<p>十一時後，即交永紗退至二一八元，遞交永紗跌至二二〇元，一六三號力購現遞不少，二二三號進至二二五元，一五一號二三一號再來供給，但以一六三號九四號二七號八九號二〇七號紛紛買進。十一時四十五分回漲到二二八元。二一八號一八六號乘高賣出，二二三號二二四號一一九號九四號二〇七號買胃仍健，臨收時復見俏利，永紗升至二二七元及二二八元結束。</p>
<p>收後喊價稍疲，結果較前收計即交股永紗華豐永公景福微升，中法新華美亞微降，新亞漲一成，景綸國貨升半成，新光麗安勤興微挫，商務則平，榮豐中紡統益中絲內衣微升，遞交股計永紗美亞華豐景福微升，新光則平。塲外各老股計閘北又有下週正式上市訊，獨昂一成半外，餘股不過平穩而已。</p>

<h3>絲織業代表在京　向政院等機關請願　當局囑返滬再與中信局交涉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區絲織業公會，爲請求核减人造絲配價事，曾於日前推派代表十五人晋京請願。茲悉：各代表曾於昨日上午，分赴社經兩部請願，兩部負責人允代向有關院部請求核减配價。　旋至行政院請願，由甘秘書長接見。據談：政院從未千涉中信局業務，對人造絲配價問題，迄尚未接中信局呈請核示之文件，囑返滬再與中信局直接交涉。又據表示：政府近望絲織業能將成品出口，以所得外匯，易取人造絲進口，亦囑返滬後與輸出推廣會接洽一切。並盼各代表與經部再度洽商，將來對日私人貿易開放後，如何使人造絲由公會方面設法進口。</p>

<p>人絲交易陷於停頓</p>
<p>人造絲因絲織業仍停止向黑市鳳辦無，昨市行情無多大上落。上午一二〇號高山有光喊二千五百八十萬元，東洋有光六百萬元，下午稍疲，高山貨喊五百六七十萬元，比上日短三十萬元，一日間成交只一二箱。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>交易雖有限，而昨市各級喊價又比上日大二十萬至五十萬元。高勻度五祖頭，綢廠商進胃頗淡，還價甚短，故仍乏做開。中級另担昨日最高價做二千七百五十萬元，高另担八百五十萬元。三十分開口貨干經另担，昨喊價升至六百萬元，比週三大誠購進價喊大一百萬元，但無做開。安徽廠絲，昨市有成交，價做二千一百萬元。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市繼續猛進，眞絲被面華强貨開市後，五十五萬元即期價成交，隔日期六十萬元，中間最高做開即期七十萬元，旋因空戶均已補齊，喊價漸呈回降，最小即期做六十三萬元，收市價爲六十六萬元，隔日期七十萬元，比上日高漲四十六七萬元。</p>

<h3>茶市呆滯</h3>
<p>昨日茶市：查吐納磋商多時之本年度祁門新紅茶，因雙方態度倔强，喊價各不遷就，交易依然陷於互擯之勢。至於其他花色，出口商賡續觀望，而本街及客帮之內銷，則亦動而之暢，致市勢猶不活潑，做開價格仍以貨品高低不一，比隔日又有參差，實際則殊少變卦。</p>
<h3>銀行外匯存戶餘額　尚有少數未曾結清</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕按照修正中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法第八條規定：「各銀行原有外匯存戶，如有餘款，應照民國卅五年九月卅日市價，售予國行」。目前各指定銀行，是否已將外匯存戶餘款，悉數售淸。商業銀行自有之外匯存款，是否亦應照上項規定辦理。記者特向該行有關方面探詢，據稱：各指定銀行原有外幣存款戶，如有餘額，應照民國卅五年九月二十日市價，售予本行。此項規定，原係本行通知各指定銀行遵照辦理在案。截至目前止，此項外幣存款戶，大部份已告淸結。尚有小數存戶，間或因散居各地，與原存款行，失却聯繫，以致未能如期淸結，正由本行隨時督促，早日淸了中。至於商業銀行自有之外匯頭寸，如在國內，亦應依照規定，於卅五年九月卅日照市價轉售本行。如在國外，可隨時按照牌價，結售本行云。</p>
<h3>上海國貨工廠聨合會　電請撤銷紗布管制</h3>
<p>上海市國貨工廠聯合會，爲請撤銷紗布南北運管制，以蘇商困，特電經濟部及紡調會，略謂自紗布轉口南北運官制一案實施以來，本市各廠紗布工業外銷停滯，生產縮减。且疊據南北客帮確報，南洋各地已成日本棉布傾銷之尾闆，並已由港澳滲入華南，而蘇魯瀕海港口，亦多日貨走私進口，轉入華北。查紗布南北運特殊管制一案，原爲防止走私國外，並為穩定物價計。今因開放對日貿易，日貨便利傾銷，以致國貨嚴受管制，反使日貨走私國內，旣非權宜之良方，殊有改弦更張之必要。理合據情電懇察核，俯賜准予明令撤銷紗布轉運南北管制辦法，以維國產，而救危機云云。</p>
<p>紗價上落不多</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况：初開客帮有進，價見上揚，嗣以買方大戶尚多顧慮，實銷依然懈意，一般浮多頻有吐售，紡調會議價雖已提高，市勢並無影響，故至最後四二支藍鳳紗仍回低至一千六百八十萬元軋平，二十支特雙馬價亦仍爲一千一百五十萬元，輕雙馬則比上日步升十萬，爲一千零三十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗有一二十萬元升降。</p>
<p>棉布先漲後回</p>
<p>昨棉布市况：以上日收後塲外龍頭細布做高至四十二萬五千，初開各貨均見高盤，而津帮吸收甚健，浮戶紛紛補空，大戶相繼扒進，龍頭細布激昂至四十五萬元。旋聞四行兩局對生產貸款將予陸續收回，再因中日貿易即將開放，致各方咸具戒心，故最後龍頭細布回低至四十四萬元，比上日軋升三萬元。但收後喊價轉軟，四十三萬六千元有賣戶，其餘各布亦均先漲後回。結果漂布嗶嘰府綢藍布及士林布等，大都軋升，檯面交易以元嗶嘰較夥。</p>
<p>又訊：中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售一三二三件、廠商申　單共四〇四張。二十支雙地球掛牌九百七十萬元，四二支水月一千六百二十萬元。</p>
<p>現棉售價微升</p>
<p>昨日現棉因棉紗續好，人心　昂，趨勢稍挺，賣戶時價提高，惟廠方尚多觀望，交易不旺。最後同業抵補，價稍軋升，各檔做開送廠價：靈寳二〇八萬，沙市一九四萬，一九七萬，棧交價靈寳二〇五萬，漢細一九〇萬，　機一五四萬，周浦籽花三二萬五千。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉布一批運往南洋，由福豐公司新輪印度怡美利號運去，計二百件運香港，一百二十件運小呂宋，五百件運曼谷。聞日內又有大批日本棉紗棉布過滬，運往爪哇。</p>

<h3>貿協電衣准許　棉子對日輸出</h3>
<p>中國進出口貿易協會頃以對日貿易指導委員會公佈對日出口貨物種類，關於棉子，棉子油，棉子餅等三項大宗出口貨，未予列入，認爲貿委會未能明瞭此項貨品在戰前對日輸出之重要。特詳具理由，電請經濟部准予列入輸出項下。因本年棉子產量豐富，亟應促進外銷，恢復出口，俾維護農村經濟云。</p>

<h3>張道藩先生五十壽序</h3>
<p>— 蔣維喬</p>
<p>我國有五千年之文化，蔚爲古國。顧歷代世運有盛裝，文化亦隨之而有升降；方其衰敝時，必有聖賢豪傑之士，崛起其間而振興之，使文化一轉其方向，發爲燦爛之輝光。歷史所載，斑斑可考。其在易實之彖辭曰：「觀乎天文，以察時變，觀乎人文，以化成天下』，孔門四科之文學，亦包括一切禮樂制度；是可知文化涵義之富，範圍之廣矣。民國紀元，承遜淸文敝之後，加以長期戰亂，至今不息，文化上所遭之摧殘破壞，亦已極矣。必有人焉，大氣包舉，登高一呼，且能認識廣大之文化，起而挽救之。環顧國中，其堪肩斯重任者，則張道藩先生是也！</p>
<p>先生以遜淸光緒二十三年丁酉，降生於黔之盤縣。考銘渠公，設敎於鄉，以淸德稱。妣氏伍，嫻習禮法，敎子義方。故先生之孝友，少成若天性焉。年未冠，畢業縣庠，有四方之志，負笈天津，入南開中學。厥後遊學英法兩國，專心藝術，於國文及科學，融會貫通；蜚聲英倫，曾膺皇家學會會員之選。學成歸國，即受簡命。初任南京市政府秘書長，累遷交通敎育內政三部次長；一任浙江敎育廳長。數歷中外，政績昭著。旋任中央執行委員，抗戰入蜀，膺選常務委員；先後兼宣傳海外兩部部長。三十年春，兼主文化蓮動委員會。先生喟然曰：『此余得行其所學之時也」，孳孳矻矻，夙夜罔倦，唯以發揚固有文化，溝通西方文化爲務；因是通儒碩士，藝人作家，莫不聲應而氣求，聞風而興起。四五年間，文化運動，如春日載陽，百花怒放，蓬蓬勃勃，極含弘光大之觀。且先生目光如炬，對於文化之認識，與常人不同；除提倡新舊文藝外，並及戲劇小說電影，兼容而併包之。其創作之戲劇，有「自誤」「自救」「殺敵救國」等多種，繙譯則有「狄四娘」「蜜月旅行」等，並有「密電碼」電影，則以先生親歷之革命爲題材，流傳尤廣。其創辦之刋物，則有「文藝先鋒」「文化先鋒」，其生編之叢書，則有「現代文藝」及「現代戲劇」等。　先生並擅中西繪畫，所作寫生，別具風格。其發起組織之文化團體，有中國文藝社，中華全國文藝界抗敵協會，中華全國戲劇界抗敵協會，中華全國美術協會，中華全國文藝作家協會。可見其措施之偉大，動作之普徧，被特影響全國，且遠及於世界矣。夫天數五，地數五，大衍之數居天地之中。先生得天獨厚，方五十初度，其治績表見於世者，已彰彰若此；此後　　期頤，必能使我國之文化，發最於全世界，可預卜也。　先生在黨在國，有大勳勞，自有史官，弭筆作頌，余可無贅；獨於其致力文化事業，聊述梗槪，以昭國人，且爲壽焉！是爲序。（中華民國三十六年七月）</p>
<h3>定山詞話</h3>
<p>— 陳定山</p>
<p>「水龍吟」正拍</p>
<p>心遠生以水龍吟貺予五十生月，予和之。其收拍云「賸人間翠墨，松溪寄夢，酒邊匙肆」。按詞律收辛稼軒一首，「倩何人喚取，紅巾翠袖，揾英雄淚」。揾字當作一逗，心遠收拍云：「約藍田嘯促，椒園竹里，共浮舟去」。於共字上作逗。則心遠是而予誤也。然按東坡水龍吟詞：「細看來不是楊花，點點是離人淚」。放翁作「嘆春來只有楊花，和恨向東風滿」。白石作「甚謝郞也恨飄零，解道月明千里」。並可作上七下六二句，即稼軒「倘何人喚取紅巾」「翠袖換英雄淚」。亦可作上七下六兩句讀。則心遠之「椒園竹里」尚未盡善也。予改　作爲「賸人間翠墨流傳，秀句滿江南地」，則協律矣。茲改正全　，附錄於左，乞海內知音大雅正拍，倘賜和作，願以畫荷一扇爲酬，藉生文字因緣。，</p>
<p>牛生湖海豪情，花愁酒祓　英氣。高秋眺景，迢迢雁字，幾行堪寄？北海樽收，東山事往，尚留賓戲。向哀箏何處？梅桃下，空携妓。</p>
<p>日下　亭賭　，唱陽關，暮霞無際。蒲靑苜碧，望中多少，斜陽飛騎。招隱城西，幅中獨在，水庭蕭寺，賸人間翠墨流傳秀句，滿江南地。</p>
<h3>西湖寫生（國號）</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<h3>湖濱雜綴</h3>
<p>— 培茵</p>
<p>湖上之晨</p>
<p>黑夜昏暗的浪潮剛才退去，我們就來倒湖濱。</p>
<p>霧，蒙住這都市，蒙住樹木，緊密地壓在湖面上。我們下了船，船身是那麼小巧玲瓏，敏感地，擺動了一下。</p>
<p>船移動了，在霧重中分水前進。遠山，堤岸全彼霧遮住了；能看到的，只是四周一片湖水，一片淸冽的湖水，要是我不知道這霧重的後面還有着山巒與堤岸，我一定會懷疑到自己是身處在一望無際的大海裏了，——倘使海水也有這樣淸冽，平靜，讓我們駕着小舟蕩漾其間，不是更可愛嗎？</p>
<p>潮濕的風從東方吹來，我們看到東方的天際有一種黃白色的光芒升起來，那麼有力地，閃耀　　　．　　覺霧氣向西方散去了，不久，我看到東面數百碼以外的湖面投下了一片金色的陽光，我們的船向東方行駛着，陽光亦向我們移近。立刻，我們穿出了霧重，陽光投射到我們的船上，轉身望去，那邊還殘留着白霧。不過，那霧氣在漸漸消退了，我看到風與陽光有力地在驅散它們……。</p>
<p>在陽光下，我看到每一個人年輕的笑容。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血　372</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「咱們這一所，大槪您佟老叔就是一位……吧！」小老虎放出了頑皮的本性；動機是想冲淡佟老叔的火性衝動。</p>
<p>「我說，小虎爺！……」佟招待加緊一綳臉，瞇起了眼睛，像近硯眼尋覓蚊子模樣，瞧準了小老虎：「您？…　！…您？…　！…您饒了我這佟老叔罷！…」他感覺無法應付小老虎，只好求饒。</p>
<p>「嘻…您別招怪，我跟您　着玩兒，……要緊的，佟老叔，您回頭指給我兩個偵探狗瞧瞧，我要瞧瞧這些家伙怎麼個賊像……」</p>
<p>「得哪，我的小爺」，佟　待把一顆腦瓜搖　更厲害，「招惹他們不得，，…他們一動全動，咱們沒關係，老百姓又該這殃了！」這是佟招待的經騐之談。</p>
<p>「您爺兒倆別撩了罷」。耀羣揮了揮手；「咱們還有許多正經，天氣不早哪……」</p>
<p>「對哪」，小老虎又接過了話頭：「　老叔，您知這，紀姨跟我三天三宿沒吃哪！…」他是說三天三宿沒有好好的吃一頓。</p>
<p>「　」，佟招待雙手一拍，瞧着小老虎「都是叫您給鬧的，打從看見汽車一停，到如今我元神還沒入竅哪！…得…這麼辦罷。大姑娘您瞧行不行？…」表示他胸有成竹。</p>
<p>「怎麼辦？」…說罷。耀羣抬身坐了想來；她預料佟招待早有一個打算。</p>
<p>「我先招呼咱們這兒的體已老媽子來侍候，您二位首先來一套衛生淸潔；洗澡，換衣；然後我呌廚房端整四大四小，給你二位洗塵帶接風……，吃完了再一休息，半夜十二點，咱們這兒有「特許」汽車送你一程，……二道口，七樹岔，都有咱們老寮新添的小站…您，見事行事，下車換馬，你二位『春風得意馬蹄疾』，赶明日一早，天不見亮，準可到寨。你看？…」佟招待發表了他的滿腹經綸。　「不成！」羅羣連連搖着頭；「我看這麼辦罷。…」她瞧着佟招待，轉動着眼珠。</p>
<p>「也行」。佟招待沒防到　羣另有打算，楞了一楞，有些煩心事似的：「沒有錯兒，聽你指揮罷，我這兒當然運命照辦！」這話音裏有些害怕、　羣行動不測，而他不敢負實的涵義；因他知道　羣和小老虎，胆大包身，敢作敢爲。</p>

<h3>為正義而飛行</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>—獻給新空軍</p>
<p>人類終極的目標，是爲着自由，和平，與安定康樂的生活。所有「凶器」，都是應該爲着保障「和平」而存在的。</p>
<p>「空軍」當然不能例外。在牠神冀飛翔底下，牠所發出的呼號，應該爲正義而戰　，爲人類幸福和平而付出犧牲的代價。</p>
<p>十年前「八一四」空軍節，中國新空軍結隊飛入上海市空，在黃浦江濱輪番轟炸日本的「出雲艦」，全上海市民不顧生命危險，對着戰　，火燄，子彈迸飛的上空，發生歡呼，這正是人類正義的呼聲！</p>
<p>南火車站敵機大轟炸下被體分裂，鮮血淋漓的景象，還不够說明”西斯蒂的殘暴麼？</p>
<p>八年中間，全國各大城市遭敵機的大屠殺，還不足以暴露軍國主義的殘酷興　情麼？</p>
<p>重慶的大轟炸，湘桂路撤退敵機的掃射，在那生死離別決定於一剎那的時候，你能不憎恨極權國家的暴行麼？</p>
<p>雖然二次大戰是過去了，我們又將和敵人面對面的草擬和約，但是眞理是只有一個的，全世界的空軍飛行員，經過這個戰爭，臘該更能明了在神翼飛翔下的空軍，牠應該爲正義而飛行，爲打擊侵略，消滅法西斯主義而戰鬥。</p>

<h3>悼黃光潤同學</h3>
<p>— 鄭禮仁</p>
<p>——紀念一位穿中水朽的英雄</p>
<p>光潤：你離開了這個世界，整整已有三足年了。在這三年漫長的歲月中，我沒有一天忘記過你，因爲你的死，是壯烈，是偉大。</p>
<p>我記得很淸楚，你時常對我說，假使你的飛機被敵人的高射砲打中了的時光，你一定要衝下去和敵人同歸於盡的。你又說：假使你的飛機在空中與敵機作戰而受了傷，你一定要和敵機相撞相碰，甚至於同歸於盡。你是這樣的勇敢果決，你是這樣的「視死如歸」。</p>
<p>但我的見解和你有些兩樣，我曾經這樣告訴過你：假使我的飛機受了傷，我一定要設法迫降或者萬不是已時跳傘，我不輕意的犠牲了我的飛機和我自己，要爲國家留一份元氣，作第二次或第三次的戰鬥和犧牲。我倆的脫法雖然不同，但我們的目標是一致的，我們要把我們的生命貢獻給我們的國家，我們要爲祖國的自由平等而戰鬥。</p>
<p>從抗戰到你成仁爲止，我們在前綫整整七個年頭，我們一夥兒生活在雲南的　自形影相隨，情同手足，誰也不願分離。</p>
<p>畢業了以後，我們分手了。大家走上了光榮的民族革命戰塲，爲着祖國作更有力的戰鬥，我調第六大隊服務（溫江），你被派到第四大隊去（　流），從此勞燕分飛，把我們的相處的距離拉長了。不過我們的心還是偎倚在一起。半年後，你移防到溫江來了，你的防地地鴨子林，我的駐地在第一總站的附近，雖然相離還不到五華里，但我們歡敍的機會，還是那樣的稀少。</p>
<p>廿九年三月十四日淸晨，敵機分四批來襲成都，那一役我們的伙伴死的死，失蹤的失蹤，我亦倒霉，受着傷，迫降在嘉陵江中沙壩上，敵人亦够吃虧，當塲被我們擊落八架，那眞是一塲劇戰，可是，光潤：你畢竟是光榮的，因有有一架是你擊落的。</p>
<p>在醫院你看了我那份診斷書，醫官們所刻劃的紅藍綫，你知道我的危險，你落過多少次眼淚，你曾經苦苦哀求過教官們，要他們特別設法挽救我的生命。</p>
<p>卅年在蘭州的春天裏，該是你生命史上最値得回味的一個時期。在那兒給你認識了一位姓沈的小姐。道純潔的愛情，對你是一種安慰，一種鼓勵，一種助力　。</p>
<p>卅三年夏天，抗戰踏入最艱難的時期，敵人抓狂地集中最精銳的主力孤注一擲，我中原戰局非常常不利，衡陽•桂林·先後棄守，敵寇直迫貴陽，陪都震動，你們的大隊和我們的大隊，奉到緊急命令，分頭出發攻擊敵人的陣地，你得了你個可喜的消息，把身上的病痛也忘記了，（你牙痛還沒有好）你一定要出發，我因爲忙着出擊，特呌阿琪來勸告你：「打擊敵人的機會多着呢！你要出發待你的牙病好了也不會　的」。但你不聽她的話，你毅然決然地穿上戰袍，高高興興地出發了，你領着隊，駕駛着40P式驅逐機，飛往荊門去攻擊敵人的高射砲陣地，誰曉得，就在這一次，我們就和你永遠分別了！</p>
<p>光潤：你是爲了我們祖國而光榮地犧性了！你的死是壯烈，是偉大的，你留給我們許多勇敢果決的好榜樣。</p>
<p>勝利不久，我從西北戰塲凱旋歸來，路過荊門，我和我的阿瑛，云兒，龍兒，特地帶了一束鮮花，奠祭你的忠魂。由荊門老百姓的口中，才知道你是遵守着平日戰鬥的諾言，率領着三架飛機俯衝到敵人陣地裏去，太壯烈了！</p>
<p>我含着熱淚、悵望着天雲，光潤，你是不朽的英雄！</p>
<p>我在今天，以我們過去深厚的友情，默默地向你致敬！</p>
<p>卅六·八一四·空軍節，於台灣空軍指揮部。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國人對於汽油的限制</p>
<p>美國的油礦以　士省及加列福尼亞省爲主，而德士省的曉士頓，就是一個著名的油城，我住的地方在　市頓與加爾伐斯頓Galveston之間，四面都是油池和打油機，數在幾千處以上，因爲油量充沛，勢如潮湧，爲避免爆炸起見，把極高的管子把汽油引到空中，終日燃燒，好像幾千支大暢燭，幽王舉烽火。這美國的烽火畢竟不同凡　，可算是世界最大的烽火了，如果要統計其損失，每年當在數十萬加侖以上，不過這種損失是不可避免而且非常値得的因爲美國人工太貴，如果大量開採，汽油價必更跌落，跌落到每加侖一二分錢，非但無利可圖，連工資都要發不出了，美國油商爲了維持每加侖七分錢的價格，寗可把剩餘汽油付之一炬，籍以保護最低利潤，猶之南美咖啡商，爲保護咖啡價格，忍痛把數百萬噸咖啡拋在洋裏。美國的汽油品類很多，在汽車站設有好幾個加汕柱，標明成分及價格，最低的每加侖七分，最高的一角二分，憑證購油，以防屯積，但聰明美國人却想出一個節省汽油的辦法，每四五個有汽車的合成一個集團，輪流儘用，平均祗消耗配額四五分之一，把剩餘汽汕賣給配不到汽油的人。美國當局把汽車用戶分成若趕等級，視其職務而配與不同量的汽油，所以除辦公外，你要想公餘作樂，出外男兜風，却沒有够量的汽油可用，他們每天節省一些，積了一星期，方可畏途旅行一次。一般的說起來，政府配給各用戶的汽油，足够用戶公事上的需要，却萬萬沒有餘量可供遊宴之用，就是美國總統也不會配到充分的汽油，因爲總統的汽油消耗量，歷來都有統計，他要多領幾加侖汽油是辦不到的，更說不上屯積居奇了。像美國那樣富庶的國家，而又生產那麼大量的汽油，人民使用汽油如此節省，反觀中國，有用汽油洗地板的，你應當作何感想？（四一）</p>

<p>他的名字呌做維克多·克拉夫靑科。在蘇聯，他犯的是叛逆罪。當一九四四年，美與蘇聯共同作戰時，他公開的辭去了蘇聯購料委員會的職務，攻擊他的政府，把國內的陰私，全部揭破。問他爲些什麼。他祗用一句話回答，那便是他所寫的暢銷書的書名：「我選擇了自由」，在十年中，他對於共產主義，漸露不滿之意。到了美國，如夢方醒，　然決定脫離了。</p>
<p>上月，他在美國國會審查對美不友好活動委員會前，申述蘇聯種種陰謀。他雖在萬分危險之中，即是他的友好，也不知道他的寄寓所在，祗能從替他印行那部書的出版處通些消息，可是他在委員會前，却仍舊侃侃而談。俄語說得這樣快，連翻譯都來不及。有時他還夾幾句生硬的英語在內。他說：</p>
<p>「每個負責的　聯代表，在美國都是政治上或經濟上的間諜。」</p>
<p>「沒有一個從蘇聯來的人不帶有搜集密件材料的使命。」</p>
<p>「蘇聯購料委員會中有個冶金專家，名呌基莫司金的，會搜集不少關於美國航空業的秘密材料，蘇聯也曾搜集美國的潛水艇業的祥情。」</p>
<p>「切勿以爲蘇聯不能製造原子彈。蘇聯的宣傳設他們的料學機威者客比柴博士已關在集中營中，這是烟幕彈。」</p>
<p>「假使史太林有什麼三長兩短　莫洛托夫會登塲的，角色也許換過一班，戲還是照樣做下去。」</p>
<p>「旅行家比共產黨員更危險，因為美國政府防不勝防。」</p>
<p>聨合國的蘇聨代表葛羅米柯對於克拉夫青科的事，則出之以談笑：</p>
<p>「假如一隻狗，在沒事的時候，自舐其腹，也許會有很多的人會聚攏來看。」</p>
<p>蘇聯大使說：</p>
<p>「賣國賊到底是賣國賊。」</p>
<p>克拉夫青科本來是憟憟恐懼，現在更不得了。第二天，他到國會的司法小組委員會，請求通過法案，讓他改入美國籍。</p>
<p>「我已有好幾夜睡不着了。我喪失了我的夫人，我的父親，我的兄弟，我的祖國。我已支撑不住了。我希望你們能懂得我的環境而來援助我一下。」</p>

<h3>追思振章</h3>
<p>— 蔡逸文</p>
<p>——殉難報人介紹之五</p>
<p>每一個朋友，對振章都有不盡的懷懇，雖然，振章的殉難，已有五六個年頭了！了！</p>
<p>振章那種靜如處女的神態，現在想起來，宛在目前；他從來沒有憤怒的時侯，即使是萬分懊惱，也僅以面紅耳赧來表示。據說：沉默的人多熱情，那末他正是這樣的人，猶記得，我們同在杭州的時候，他家住在平海路，三五友朋，日常在他家裏，飲食起居，莫不與共！</p>
<p>他來上海，又和我同一報館工作，差不多晨昏相見，相處更久；那時我剛結婚，携眷住在海寗路，他機乎時來我處，常以雀戰消遣；某年除夕，他親　山西路當貨舖，以二元購雀牌一付，邀集同事二三，博戰至年初一始罷。</p>
<p>不幸晨報停刋，勞燕分飛，我入工商界服務；他受辛報宓季方先生之邀，主編時事版，　年，因出版紀念刋，曾撰「三百六十五天」一文，以表其從事辛報　務的艱舊苦勉的經過；不料該文由總編輯姚蘇鳳大事節刪，題目改爲「一天」（？）那時，他夜間來我虹口住所過訪，悻悻以此事相告，我亦頗寄同情，予以慰勵！</p>
<p>不久，王啓熙先生主持大美晚報編務，邀振章相助；是時適振章處事苦悶，遂毅然應聘入大美，初不料因此而成仁也！</p>
<p>自敵僞「黑單」公布，振章名列榜上，啓煦先生間道赴港，振章則留守上海；而敵僞之欲得留滬報人也益亟；先有朱惺公等人之被害，復日以信件警告赴僞「特工總部」報到；因之振章出入時具戒心；但仍不免爲敵僞鷹爪所殘害。</p>
<p>當被害之夕，途中聞報販大喊「大美晚報標語被殺」！急購一份，巨幅像片乃振意也，不及細讀內容，奔赴廣慈　院，探問德勢，院中以傷勢過　，不允會見；不得已日　其平安無恙，不料未及二日，竟以逝世聞、悲已！</p>
<p>「九一三」爲振軍餉終之期，假萬國殯議館大殮，除大美晚報白羅斯，高　德緒人親自送殯外；晨報舊人僅顧俊元兄和我二人；他母親本來神經不佳，受此重大刺激，暈厥多次，悽慘之狀，即使鐵石心腸，也爲之心動。</p>
<p>殉難後二年，他母親爲他卜葬於虹橋公墓，比鄰爲另一殉難報人張似旭之墓，其生前女友某爲之奔走經紀，始終其事，亦振章生前待人以誠之報也。尚有一陸平達君，更以萍水相逢，熟忱可風，營業請事，均出其手，謹特爲之表揚。</p>
<p>也正如其他殉難報人一樣，遺屬都很淸苦，度日維艱；他母親因受刺激過深，居恒咄咄，日對遺像，喃喃不已；日前與周味辛兄相訪於辣斐德路停雲里三層擱上，相見即涕淚交流，悲痛欲絕！我們只有勸慰而已。</p>
<p>現在，味辛和我的意思，想聯絡杭州的　友，和振章以前的同事，來發起一個悼念會，商措一切未了的事情：諸如墓碑的設　，遺屬的贍養等等；我想杭州「吶喊」「獅吼」二社的社友：以及上海晨報，辛報大美晚報的同事們，都樂予慷慨的助成已！</p>
<p>末了，我摘下二個通訊處：（一）社會局周　　（二）申報　逸文。</p>

<h3>Adjustment of Salaries for Civil and Military Officials: Implementation of Increased Salt Tax Approved First; State Council Approves Dismissal of Li Daming</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The State Council Committee held its ninth meeting at 9:00 AM on the 15th, presided over by Chairman Chiang. Attendees included Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Yu Youren, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, Mo Dehui, Wang Yunwu, and Xu Fulin, totaling sixteen individuals. The meeting began with reports on the agenda, including the method of organizing a business delegation to Japan. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Defense Minister Bai Chongxi reported on recent diplomatic and military situations, respectively. The meeting then discussed the following proposals: (1) Adjustment of salaries for civil and military officials and additional payment of price difference subsidies in kind to public education personnel in Beiping and Tianjin. A resolution was passed. (2) Adjustment of salt tax measures. A resolution was passed, approving immediate implementation, while still submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for legislative procedures. (3) It was resolved that Li Daming, a member of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Committee, should be dismissed from his post due to his prolonged absence. (4) Outline of measures to strictly implement consumption savings. A resolution was passed. (5) Compilation and examination methods for the general budget of provincial and municipal governments for the 37th year. A resolution was passed. (6) Several other financial budget proposals were also passed. The meeting adjourned at 12:45 PM.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The adjustment of salaries for civil and military officials has been approved by the ninth State Council meeting and will be implemented from August. The main points of this adjustment are as follows: (1) The original zoning method will be maintained. The original five zones were reduced to four to reduce the disparity in treatment between regions, and each region was re-established based on the price fluctuation index of each region in July, so as to be in line with reality. (2) The base number is increased by 100,000 yuan, and the multiplier remains the same. The base number in the first district is 400,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,800. The base number in the second district is 390,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,600. The base number in the third district is 340,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,300. The base number in the fourth district is 300,000 yuan, and the multiplier is 1,000. (3) The distribution of essential supplies to public education employees in Nanjing and Shanghai will continue. It was decided to extend the distribution method to Beiping and Tianjin, where there is a shortage of food. Before implementation, the price difference in kind will be distributed from August. The standard for Nanjing in June and July will be used, set at 200,000 yuan per month for each staff member, half for public servants, and 50,000 yuan per month for police officers who already have food and clothing allowances. (4) The treatment of military officers will be adjusted in accordance with the corresponding ranks of civil servants (because their grading is less than that of civil servants below the rank of lieutenant general, the middle level salary of their equivalent rank in civil service will be the standard). (5) The personnel of state-owned enterprises shall be treated in accordance with the Measures for the Treatment of Personnel of State-Owned Enterprises approved by the former Supreme National Defense Council.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The contents of the salt tax adjustment plan passed by the State Council are as follows: The salt tax rate is increased to 100,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), the local gum salt tax rate is increased to 80,000 yuan per dan, the fishing and agricultural salt tax rate is increased to 5,000 yuan per dan, and industrial salt remains tax-free.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Fu Wei Chang Nai悳 (Youth Party) passed away due to illness. Fu Wei Wu Xianzi (Democratic Socialist Party) and Zheng Wei Li Daming (Democratic Socialist Party) have been absent for a long time. The State Council meeting on the 15th decided to dismiss them. Regarding the issue of filling the vacancies, this reporter inquired with a government official, who said: The authorities have not yet considered whether the successors of the two Fu Weis and one Zheng Wei will still be recommended and filled by the Min and Qing parties, and it is likely to be temporarily vacant.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th] The State Council meeting on the 15th passed several amendments to the control of foreign exchange, but no resolution was reached on adjusting the exchange rate. The State Council also passed measures to tighten control over gold transactions and eliminate black market foreign currency transactions, including prohibiting Chinese people from traveling abroad in an unofficial capacity and restricting foreign travel by government officials in order to save foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>President Zhang Discusses Adjustment Features: Principle of Not Worrying About Scarcity But About Inequality; All Public Officials Treated Equally</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The adjustment of the salaries of civil and military personnel was passed by the State Council meeting on the 15th. President Zhang of the Executive Yuan made the following remarks to a Central News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>The government's adjustment of the treatment of civil and military officials and personnel of state-owned enterprises is based on the principle of not worrying about scarcity but about inequality. On the one hand, it takes into account the difficult lives of civil and military officials, and on the other hand, it considers the heavy burden on the national treasury. After a long period of research, the first feature of this method is that, for the treatment of military personnel, which has always been far inferior to that of civil servants, fair adjustments have been proposed repeatedly for 20 years, but have not been realized. Now, regardless of various difficulties, the treatment of civil and military personnel is finally brought into line.</p>
<p>The second feature of this method is that for the treatment of state-owned enterprise personnel, which has always been far superior to that of civil servants, reductions within the prescribed limits have been proposed repeatedly for several years. As a result, not only has it not been reduced, but it has become more serious and has been increased. Now, regardless of various difficulties, the treatment of state-owned enterprises has been reduced to within the original preferential limit. The official salaries of civil and military officials are different, and their treatment was originally difficult to be consistent. This time, in order to specially increase the treatment of military personnel, the military personnel were classified according to their special, simplified, recommended, and entrusted grades, and compared with the official salaries of the special, simplified, surviving, and entrusted grades of civil weaves. However, civil servants do not have the supply of staple and non-staple foods and family rations, while military personnel do. In order to achieve consistency between civil and military personnel, this staple and non-staple food expenses should be removed from the adjusted treatment of military personnel, and family rations should be canceled. After this adjustment, the actual treatment received by military officers has increased by an average of one time compared with the past. As for soldiers, in addition to the increase in non-staple food expenses to 60,000 yuan per person per month, the pay they should receive has been increased in accordance with the end of the budget. Sergeants have increased to 10,000 times, corporals 12,000 times, and privates 15,000 times. The lower the base number, the greater the increase. After this adjustment, the salary of privates is exactly equal to double the number before the adjustment. In total, due to the adjustment of the treatment of civil and military personnel, the combined salary increase for military officers and soldiers is 230.8 billion yuan per month, which is a very large amount.</p>
<h3>Adjustment Number in August: Universal Increase of 100,000 Per Person</h3>
<p>Since the government is determined to achieve the goal of consistent treatment for civil and military personnel, the increase in the burden on the national treasury is extremely large. There is no remaining capacity for the adjustment of the treatment of civil servants in August. In addition, since the treatment of civil and military personnel is consistent, if there is any adjustment in the treatment of civil servants in the future, military personnel will have to make the same adjustment. Therefore, the adjustment in August is even more difficult. However, in view of the suffering of civil servants and the considerable increase in prices in recent months, if this adjustment is not made, civil servants, especially those with lower salaries, will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. After repeated consideration, only the basic number obtained by each person has been adjusted. Each district has increased by 100,000 yuan per month. This number may seem small, but for the current women's military and provincial personnel, this item alone has increased the monthly expenditure of the national treasury by no less than 135.6 billion yuan (82 billion yuan for the central speed provincial level and 53.6 billion yuan for the military).</p>
<p>In addition, two more measures have been taken in connection with this: First, the treatment of civil servants has been divided into five districts according to the level of the cost of living, and the difference is large. This time, it has been changed to four districts, and the new adjustment and compilation have been made according to the cost of living in various places. Those who have been promoted to the fourth district due to the cancellation of the original fifth district, or who have been promoted to the third, second, and first districts from the original fourth, third, and second districts, in addition to the universal increase of 100,000 yuan per person in the base number, the original base number and the salary increase multiplier can also be recursively promoted due to the recursive promotion of the district. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Embassy of the Union of India: Flag Raising Ceremony Held; Chinese and Foreign Guests Gladly Congratulate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The 15th is the day of the rebirth of India. The Embassy of India on Beiping Road was crowded with cars and horses, and guests came one after another, presenting an unprecedented joyful scene. The flag of the Union of India, a red, white, and green tricolor with a spinning wheel in the center, rose slowly and fluttered in the air to the sound of the passionate and devout Indian national anthem, representing the ancient civilization of India, which finally freed itself from two centuries of servitude and gained precious independence. Before 9:00 AM, about 200 of our government leaders and foreign envoys in Beijing came one after another to congratulate and participate in the flag raising ceremony. The ceremony began at 8:00 AM. Ambassador Menon first read Chairman Chiang's eulogy, and then gave a speech, stating that the moment of this flag raising is the most meaningful moment in Indian history, or even in Asian and world history. From today onwards, India has regained its place on the international stage as an independent country. The Ambassador expressed his deep gratitude to those who have expressed sympathy or provided assistance in the arduous process of India's struggle for independence, and especially expressed his gratitude to China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom for their lasting friendship. After the speech, the flag was raised in a salute with all standing and watching. Subsequently, our Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun and Foreign Minister Wang Shijie delivered congratulatory speeches one after another, both of whom recalled the cultural and friendly exchanges between China and India over the past two thousand years, and mentioned Chairman Chiang's appeal to the Indian people when he defended India in February 1942, which expressed his expectations for Indian independence. The two also emphasized that China and India, two great brotherly nations, will join hands and make important contributions to world peace and human happiness. After the chief diplomatic envoy stationed in Beijing, the Brazilian Ambassador You Lan, delivered a congratulatory speech, the guests and hosts happily shared champagne, and the ceremony was completed. Also, Nehru has sent a mine telegram to thank Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang for their congratulations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] "Green represents the flourishing earth, white represents the bright day, red represents countless sacrifices, and the center is a spinning wheel. You remember Mr. Gandhi's spinning flower army, which represents abundance." Mrs. Menon, the Ambassador with a touch of rouge on her forehead and wearing gorgeous and beautiful clothes, explained the meaning of this beautiful flag in an excited tone. "I am so happy today." The diamond jewelry on the left nostril made her smile even brighter. India's independence came from countless sacrifices. After several kidney transplant gentlemen laughed, they talked about Gandhi's billion-dollar character, Nehru's shrewdness and competence, and the blood and sweat of all the Indian people, which overcame all difficulties and determined India's destiny. It was so in the past. It will also depend entirely on this in the future. Mr. Yu Youren twisted his silver beard, "This is also our long-cherished wish." Mr. Wen Yuanning and Mr. Zhang Daofan, etc., all praised the British people's open-mindedness and the Indian people's determination. "This is the most glorious achievement in the world today. There should be no more things that cannot be properly solved." The small lawn on the right side of the office hall of the Indian Embassy was full of people, laughter, and flying wine glasses. This was a joyful morning. Everyone was delighted with the independence that countless sacrifices had brought. China's brotherly nation had gained freedom and new life. Gandhi's spinning wheel represents abundance and will also return to Sakyamuni's Pure Land. But what about China itself? President Zhang Qun said in his welcome speech, expressing his feelings, "We believe that in the world, all actions that originate from aggressive motives, one party gains something, and the other party will lose something. On the contrary, all actions that originate from justice, the giver and the receiver get the same..." After celebrating for the brotherly nation, his "sympathy" is not superfluous.</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong's New Speech: Warning to Yi People; Government Determined to Maintain Integrity of Entire Xinjiang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 14th] Zhang Zhizhong indirectly warned the Yi people at the ceremony for Ma Liang to be appointed as the Xinjiang Supervisory Envoy, saying: "The central government has handed over all rights to the people of Xinjiang, but it must ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty. The government must not abandon this land and all the people of Xinjiang. If anyone wants to destroy this principle and lead Xinjiang on another path, it is absolutely impossible, and it will never be possible. The result will be to push all the people of Xinjiang onto the path of destruction." He stated, "During my year in Xinjiang, the peaceful policy I have implemented shows the central government's true attitude towards Xinjiang, and what all the people of Xinjiang desire today is peaceful construction, not a warlike attitude. The recent organized riots in Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun are an explanation of this. This kind of anti-peace thought must not be the thought of the people of Xinjiang, nor the thought of the Chinese people." According to reports, since the Yi people refused to recognize Mexut as the new provincial chairman on May 28, Yi personnel have been gradually withdrawing from Dihua. On the morning of the 12th, Aximaiti Wang (Deputy Provincial Chairman) returned to Yili by plane, and the unification of Xinjiang has become a serious problem.</p>

<p>"The British Parliament sent a delegation to China during the war, leaving behind extremely pleasant memories. Our country also made a return visit under extremely difficult transportation conditions to comfort each other for their hard work and overcome difficulties together. The friendly relations between China and Britain have naturally been strengthened. This time, the British Parliament has sent another delegation to China after the victory of the joint war, and the results can be expected to be more pleasant and satisfactory. Moreover, China and Britain, especially China, have suffered significant losses due to the war, and both economies are facing difficulties. I believe that this will further promote mutual sympathy, understanding, and cooperation."</p>
<h3>Reformist Faction of the Democratic Socialist Party: Opening of the National Congress; Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei Hired as Consultants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The National Congress jointly convened by the Reformist Faction and Overseas Faction of the Democratic Socialist Party opened at the Yiyuan Hotel at 9:00 AM yesterday. Forty domestic representatives and twenty-five overseas representatives attended, with Wu Xianzi serving as the interim chairman. Wu delivered a brief opening speech, elucidating the party's aspirations, and then invited Zhang Dongsun to speak as a consultant, delivering a generous speech and contributing three points: (1) The political line should be grasped, and one should not be fickle, opportunistic, or resort to speculation. The temptation of this era is great, and special attention should be paid to this. (2) Party members should fulfill their obligations to the party and should not expect to gain positions from the party. (3) Internal factions should be avoided, which is a common symptom after a political party expands. The Democratic Socialist Party should be cautious about this from the beginning in order to create a democratic style. After the speech, there was thunderous applause. Sun Baogang made a temporary motion to invite Zhang to formally join, which was unanimously passed. Subsequently, the presidium was elected, consisting of nine people: Wu Xianzi, Zhang Aisun, Liang Qiushui, Wan Wu, Sha Yankai, Sun Baogang, Wang Shiming, Lu Guangsheng, and Tang Caizhi. This morning is still for group review, and the party constitution will be discussed at the afternoon meeting. The political program and proposals will be discussed tomorrow, and the election of central executive and supervisory committee members will be discussed on the 18th, after which the congress will close.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report from this city, the Reformist Faction has hired Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei as consultants.</p>

<h3>Northeast Commemorates the Second Anniversary of Restoration; Chief of General Staff Chen Inspects Changchun; No Bandit Traces Within 100 Li of Jilin City</h3>
<p>[Our Panyang Correspondent, 15th] Today marks the second anniversary of the Northeast Restoration on "August 15th." The entire city is decorated with flags and meetings are held to celebrate. The people have experienced joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness over the past two years, but hope to live and work in peace as soon as possible. Chief of General Staff Chen, along with Zheng Dongguo and Liang Huasheng, flew to Changchun at 9:00 AM today, and may proceed to Jilin.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Correspondent, 15th] Chief of General Staff Chen, accompanied by Acting Governor Zheng Dongguo and Jilin Chairman Liang Huasheng, arrived in Changchun at 8:40 AM today from Panyang on a special "Tianxiong" airplane, landing at Dafangshen Airport at 10:30 AM. Sun Liren, Pan Yu, and others went to the airport to welcome them. Chen stayed at the Xingyuan Guest House and inspected the field hospital and rear hospital in the afternoon. At 3:00 PM, he gave a speech to the students of the National Defense Ministry's Youth Middle School, and at 4:00 PM, he gave a speech to the military officers stationed in Changchun and Jilin at the Lizhi Society. He is scheduled to return to Panyang on the 16th.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Correspondent, 15th] Chairman Liang Huasheng told our reporter that the future of the Northeast war situation is optimistic. The National Army's deployment is largely in place, and we will launch a counterattack without waiting for the sixth offensive by the Communist bandits. Guerrilla warfare is active in eastern Jilin, with commando teams striking the enemy everywhere, causing panic in the enemy's rear. The Communist bandits suspect even farmers tilling the land are commandos, which shows their fear. Two months ago, bandit traces could be found within 15-25 li of Jilin City, but now there are no Communist bandits within 100 li. The National Army is advancing towards northern and eastern Jilin. Jilin is no longer a fortress we are guarding, but a forward command post.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Today, Changchun is filled with national flags, reminding the 600,000 citizens of the two profound scenes of jubilation and grief experienced by both Chinese and Japanese people in the puppet capital (Xinjing) on this day two years ago. However, today, two years later, the citizens have suffered greatly from the Communist bandits' rebellion and can only reminisce about the excitement of two years ago. Today, the Youth Corps mobilized to give street speeches, and radio stations broadcast special programs to commemorate the restoration.</p>
<h3>Sun Liren Flies to Shenyang, Then to Nanjing, Hoping That Compatriots Will Stay in Their Posts and Rectify Decadent Trends</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Correspondent, 15th] Sun Liren is scheduled to fly to Panyang on the 16th and arrive in Nanjing before the 20th. Various circles here held a tea party at 6:00 PM on the 15th to bid him farewell. Sun told reporters yesterday: "I am busy training new troops, but I have nothing to report for now." Regarding this matter, there are various speculations in the newspapers, and I cannot confirm which news is correct. When asked about Wedemeyer's mission to the Northeast, he said: "To collect general relevant information. Our government will provide some strong evidence of Soviet aid to the Communist bandits." A reporter asked when the Communist bandits might launch their sixth offensive. He replied: "I judge that after the new rainy season, at the time of the autumn harvest, the Communist bandits may launch a large disturbance for the purpose of seizing grain."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Army Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Training Commander Sun Liren told reporters on the 14th: "Since taking office, newspapers in various places have been reporting news related to me, but much of this news is untrue. For example, I did not go to Taiwan, but some newspapers reported that I had been there. After leaving the Northeast, I traveled through Nanjing, Shanghai, Germany, and other places. Regarding my impressions, Sun said with a solemn expression: "The social order and social morality in various places are declining. We should deeply consider the difficulties faced by the country and the nation, stay in our posts, and rectify this trend."</p>

<p>[Our Xuzhou Correspondent, 15th] The National Army in the Yu-Wan area has completed its new deployment, and a major annihilation campaign is about to begin. Liu Bocheng's remnant bandit troops, scattered in the Ningling, Taikang, and Hao County areas, have been repeatedly defeated and are short of supplies.

The National Army northwest of Dongping completely annihilated more than 3,000 bandits of the 28th Division at Balihe on the south bank of the Yellow River on the 14th, capturing more than 300 warhorses and more than 400 rifles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The National Army's operation to relieve the remaining bandits in the Liangshan and Jiao Triangular Area of western Shandong has revealed that the number of prisoners alone has reached 10,000, and other war spoils are still being inventoried.</p>

Due to the overwhelming momentum of the National Army, the Communist bandits collapsed in disarray upon contact.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Destroyed More Than 1,000 Kilometers of Railways in North China in Six Months; 296 Bridges Destroyed</h3>

<h3>Employers Reject Ultimatum; General Strike Breaks Out in Hong Kong; Authorities Took Strict Precautions Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th] The Chinese Machine Workers' Union ordered its members to strike immediately tonight. 356 workers on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway were the first to obey the order and strike. There has been no movement at the Royal Navy Dockyard as of press time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] The ultimatum issued by the Chinese Labour Association was rejected by employers at 4 PM today. At 5 PM (the deadline of the ultimatum), the union ordered its workers to strike tomorrow morning. However, this general strike will not be as serious and widespread as previously anticipated. It is understood that traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway will not be affected. Public services such as water, trams, electricity, and telephones will continue as normal. Shipyards will be the hardest hit. The Hong Kong government stated this afternoon that the authorities are well-prepared to deal with any actions taken by the Chinese Labour Association and will maintain all conveniences for the general public.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] After the Chinese Labour Association presented an ultimatum to the Hong Kong government demanding wage increases, all Hong Kong residents were shocked by this huge labor movement and deeply worried that their daily lives would be affected. To prevent accidents, the authorities have ordered the police to pay attention to maintaining law and order. Riot squad members have been issued tear gas and are ready to deploy at any time. On the one hand, they are preparing to send technical troops to take over various public utilities such as electricity and water, in order to maintain daily supplies.</p>
<h3>Trial Begins for the Zhonghe Bridge Tragedy in Nanjing; Ten Witnesses Interrogated Yesterday Morning and Afternoon; Case Gaining Clarity, Trial to Continue Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The trial for the case of the drowning death of a Chinese Air Force soldier by American soldiers at Zhonghe Bridge in the capital began this morning at the Lizhi Society by a US military court. It was originally set for both Savini and Adoree to be tried at the same time, but at the request of the defendant's lawyer, Weiss, Adoree was tried first. A total of ten Chinese and foreign witnesses were interrogated in the morning and afternoon. The case has gained some clarity, and the interrogation will continue on the 16th.</p>
<p>No Empty Seats in the Gallery</p>
<p>Today's trial of American soldiers is the first of its kind in the capital since the end of the war. Chinese and foreign people are paying close attention, and many went to attend the hearing, with no empty seats in the gallery. Dong Lin, Director of the Department of Americas of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ni Huiqing, Director of the Criminal Department of the Ministry of Justice, Chen Guangchu, Chief Prosecutor of the Capital District Court, and others attended the hearing. At about 8:00 AM, the presiding judge, Colonel Moore, judges Gray and Gan Tai, and others entered the courtroom decorated with the Stars and Stripes one after another. The family members of the victim Ge Fatian, including his mother, Mrs. Wang, his uncle Ge Youji, and the parents of Wang Shouben, Wang Guohua and Mrs. Wang Li, sat in the audience, wiping their tears from time to time and talking to the witnesses about the tragedy. Soon, the defendants Adoree and Savini were escorted in, and the trial officially began at 8:30 AM.</p>
<p>Prosecutor States the Case</p>
<p>After completing the oath and other procedures, the defendant's lawyer, Weiss, requested that Judge Mathis recuse himself and be replaced by another judge, maintaining the number of nine judges. Prosecutor Gan Tai read out the charges, and the lawyer moved to have Adoree tried first. The court temporarily closed to consider the matter and decided to grant the request. Savini withdrew, and Adoree was interrogated first. The prosecutor, Chen, first presented the case, explaining how Adoree intentionally and illegally pushed Wang Shouben and Ge Fatian into the water to drown them. Then, the testimony of the witnesses was heard. The first witness was Captain Delan, the defendant's superior, who answered questions about the arrest of the defendant. The second witness was the head of the US Army Criminal Investigation Division, who reported on the inspection of the incident site. Photographer Tom Mays also testified, reporting on the on-site photography process. Xu Pite explained the detailed drawing of the Zhonghe Bridge. Finally, a pair of experienced navigators explained the speed, depth, and flow of the water at Zhonghe Bridge. When the above five people testified, the prosecutor presented photos and maps, questioning them in great detail. The defendant's lawyer also raised questions, showing great care and attention.</p>
<p>At 11:15 AM, after a five-minute break, Cheng Chaozong, a Chinese military policeman who was familiar with Adoree, was scheduled to testify. Cheng pointed out Adoree as the perpetrator on the spot and answered in detail about the situation of Adoree and others driving into the airfield that night. The prosecutor repeatedly cross-examined him and repeatedly told him to tell the truth. He answered truthfully, replying "What do you do for a living?" and loudly said "I am a military policeman of the Republic of China," leaving a very good impression.</p>
<p>Witnesses Struggle to Cope</p>
<p>The next witness was Tu Chonghai, an Air Force mechanic who witnessed the American soldiers throwing Wang Shouben into the water. He was also almost thrown into the river by the American soldiers at the time, making him one of the most important witnesses in the case. Due to the differences in legal customs between China and foreign countries, coupled with the fact that Tu seemed to have a lower level of education, there was a long debate between the two sides over procedural issues before he was formally questioned. Tu reported in detail the situation of Wang and Ge being thrown into the river at that time. The prosecutor also asked him to point out the location of the incident on a map, which he did on the spot. However, the defendant's lawyer still nitpicked in various ways, making sophistical arguments, making Tu Chonghai, who had limited knowledge and did not understand Western grammar, struggle to cope. The court recessed again at about 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>At about 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Tu Chonghai was interrogated again. The lawyer questioned Tu in great detail about whether he knew Wang Shouben, how he knew that the deceased was Wang, and how he knew that Adoree was the one who pushed Wang into the water. Using a pencil as an example, he repeatedly cross-examined Tu. He also questioned in detail whether Tu witnessed Wang being pushed into the water. Although Tu answered to the best of his knowledge, the lawyer stated that there were discrepancies in Tu's previous and subsequent answers, stating that he could not obtain from Tu's testimony whether Wang was thrown, pushed, or voluntarily jumped into the water. He also expressed doubts about other points. Tu is one of the most important witnesses in the case, so he was questioned for more than an hour.</p>
<p>Testimony of American Soldiers in the Same Car</p>
<p>Next, Hult, an American soldier who traveled with Adoree, was interrogated. Hult testified that Adoree had lifted up a Chinese person sitting on the Zhonghe Bridge and thrown him into the river when he came to the club that night. At that time, only one person got out of the jeep, and he explained that when he lifted the person up, one of the Chinese person's hands was bent behind his back, and the other hand was also twisted. At that time, he did not resist. Another Chinese person then fled. Another American soldier, Parker, also testified that Adoree pushed a Chinese person into the water, but said that he could not remember what they had said to each other at that time.</p>
<p>Finally, Lane, the American military policeman on duty that night, was questioned. He had received a call from Adoree that night. He could tell from the phone that Adoree was drunk. He told the court that before he came to answer the phone, he had spoken to Adoree at the airfield. Adoree was already drunk at that time, walking unsteadily, and had pushed the witness's shoulder with his hand. The questioning ended at 4:15 PM in the afternoon. Due to the lateness of the hour, the trial was adjourned until the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, today's trial was satisfactory. The meticulousness of the American legal procedure and the various cross-examinations by the prosecutor and lawyer were admirable. However, when questioning Chinese witnesses, Western customs were forcibly imposed, and the judges lacked a general understanding of Chinese customs, which may affect the progress of the trial and future judgments. This seems to be a regrettable matter.</p>
<h3>Tang Zong Hosts the Press to Tour the Criminal Laboratory</h3>
<p>Police Observe the Anniversary of the Establishment of the German Law Firm</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 15th] The National Police Agency of the Ministry of Interior was established on August 15th last year, and today marks its first anniversary. Director Tang Zong presented the actual work of the agency as a celebration. He held a reception from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM to invite the judiciary and the press to visit the only criminal laboratory in the country. The equipment of the laboratory was received from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization. It is divided into ten groups: physics and chemistry, fingerprint, photography, forensics, technology, forensic instruments, ballistics, supply, police dogs, and police pigeons. There were also on-site demonstrations during the tour. The rarest piece of equipment is the surveillance aircraft. It is said that there are only two such aircraft in the world, one in the United States and one in this laboratory. The balance in the physics and chemistry group has an accuracy of one ten-thousandth, and even the weight of a single hair can be accurately measured. The police dog's performance in searching for criminals, tracking, and rescuing police officers was the most satisfying for the visitors. During the tour, Tang Zong and senior officials of the laboratory accompanied the visitors and explained the work of each group, giving the listeners a thorough understanding.</p>
<h3>Continuous Rain in Northeast; Rivers Flooding Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] In various parts of the Northeast, there has been continuous rain in recent days, causing flash floods. The water level of each river has risen sharply. The Taizi River rose more than six meters in one day and night from the 12th to the 13th. The Haijian disaster area, which had already dried up, has once again become a swamp. The newly built dikes in the Liaoyang disaster area have also been flooded by floodwaters, and the completed project has been in vain. The water level of the Songhua River in the north has also rebounded.</p>
<h3>Outer Embankment of Fen River Destroyed; Taiyuan Threatened by Flooding</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Correspondent, 14th] On the 11th, heavy rain and flash floods destroyed 240 meters of the outer embankment of the Fen River, threatening Bing City. The authorities ordered 15,000 soldiers and civilians to rush to repair it. The river banks of the North and South Sha Rivers around the city also collapsed, and Danankai became a vast expanse of water, turning into a swamp. Villagers are rushing to deal with the emergency.</p>
<h3>Only Rumors About the Change of System in Qiongyai; Island Residents Eagerly Await a Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 13th] (Delayed) Rumors about the change of system in Hainan Island have been circulating for three months, but the central government has not made a decision. During this reporter's inspection of Hainan Island, I stayed in Haikou for three days. Based on the impressions gained from the tour, I deeply feel that government personnel at all levels are in a wait-and-see state of mind, and the administrative work has almost come to a standstill. Administrative Commissioner Cai Jingjun is responsible for directing the suppression of bandits in Qionghai and is eager to govern well. The people also have the same sense of depression, believing that the island is a major resource of our country and urgently needs the cooperation of the government and the people to build and develop it. They eagerly hope that the central government will make a decision as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The reporter returned from Qiongyai yesterday and met with Director Zhang Fakui of the Executive Committee. I asked him when he would go to Hainan Island and for his opinion on the change of system in Hainan Island. Zhang said: "I know nothing except what I read in the newspapers!" He jokingly told the reporter that if there was an appointment, please send it to the general receiving room first. Zhang was very interested in Taiwan, praising the various aspects of the area, and said that he had a very pleasant trip. He believes that the banditry in Guangdong Province is serious, but also not serious. He advocates nine parts politics and one part military, and that the people's armed forces should be organized and the basic-level cadres should be strengthened. He said that because there are no communists in Guangdong Province, only bandits who rob, loot, and extort, the situation is very different from that in the north.</p>

<h3>A Batch of Corrupt Officials in Luan County Punished by Dismissal</h3>

<h3>Editorial: Looking Forward to the Future of Scholarship in Our Nation</h3>
<p>Mr. Yan Jici, Director of the Institute of Physics at the Peiping Research Academy, recently told the press: "Our nation's research into atomic energy has just begun. In Peiping, colleagues at the institute are concentrating all their efforts on this one topic... Researcher Qian Sanqiang discovered a new method of nuclear fission in France, which was highly praised by authorities in physics such as Joliot-Curie. The institute is hesitant to urge him to return, as our research equipment is not as complete as that of European research institutes." Why is it "hesitant" to urge research personnel to return home? This illustrates that academic researchers may lose their research tools and venues once they return to China.</p>
<p>A dispatch from our reporter stationed in Peiping reports the crisis in education in the old capital, saying: "Today, when discussing education, everyone is almost too busy to consider systems, teachers, and equipment. The only remaining daily concern for teachers and students is the problem of survival." In fact, this is not only the case in Peiping, but it has become a common phenomenon throughout the country.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that scholarship is the cornerstone of nation-building. Without scholarship, the country cannot be ranked among the powerful nations. However, the construction of scholarship takes the most time. Without research tools and the long-term efforts of scholars, it is difficult to achieve anything. Countries such as England, America, and the Soviet Union compete not only in military preparations but also in academic research. Therefore, education and academic research in all countries have been progressing every day since the war. And the budgets that countries spend in this area are also extremely large. However, what is the situation of academic research in our country after the war? Just looking at the two news reports above is enough to make people worry.</p>
<p>Compared with countries such as England, America, France, and the Soviet Union, our nation's research institutes are very immature. The Academia Sinica, which is relatively large in scale, has not yet recovered its original vitality due to war and relocation in recent years. As for the research institutes of various universities, their content is mostly empty. Scientific research is originally an accumulation of bit by bit and cannot be expected to succeed overnight, and it cannot be like an industrial and commercial investment, hoping to obtain profits within a certain period of time. Therefore, in today's society, which is eager for quick success and instant benefits, academic research is neglected or despised by the general public. The lives of practitioners are precarious. Like most public educators, they are struggling on the brink of starvation. Their seedlings lack the nourishment of rain and dew and are constantly exposed to the scorching sun of midsummer. It would be a great blessing if they do not wither and die.</p>
<p>The vast majority of academic research workers are professors in universities. It is truly pathetic to say that professors are now about to become beggars; many people have already "changed careers" to make a living. Loyal and pious workers have long been overwhelmed by the seven basic necessities of life. Many people have lost their health due to malnutrition and heavy workload. A well-known scholar who has taught for more than 30 years and is a professor appointed by the ministry could at least "live without worry" abroad, but unfortunately, in today's China, he still has to help his wife with household chores. Even a female worker cannot be hired. A professor who has taught for more than 20 years once arrived late for an academic lecture and stood up to apologize, saying: "My wife gave birth a few days ago, and I have to do everything at home because I am also working as a female worker, so I am late. I am very sorry!" The treatment of senior university professors is equivalent to that of civil officials in the simplified appointment and military officers, but their lives are so difficult. How can they have a peaceful state of mind to talk about scholarship? Some people in society blame professors for not guiding students to study knowledge properly, which is really unfair! In this situation, the works are naturally very mediocre, and even if there are specialized academic papers, few people buy them. Bookshops, considering the "cost," also find it difficult to publish them. Therefore, there are few books with relatively academic weight in today's publishing industry! The Ministry of Education announced that the first prize for academic works and inventions of the Academic Review Committee for the 34th year is 800,000 yuan, the second prize is 400,000 yuan, and the third prize is 200,000 yuan. The first prize cannot buy a set of old suits now, the second prize cannot buy a pair of better leather shoes, and the third prize cannot buy two or five pounds of milk powder. Chinese scholarship is so worthless! For the sake of life, professors have to take time out from studying knowledge to go to the streets to buy vegetables and argue with small merchants and peddlers, or hold their children at home to save expenses. The time for research is completely deprived. In this situation, professors in Beijing and Shanghai may be able to manage, and the situation is better, but professors in the inland provinces are used to it.</p>
<p>It has already been mentioned above that academic research requires a long time, because equipment and talents cannot be achieved in a short time. His work is like "water nourishing stone." Researchers and professors are leaders. They must cultivate themselves while also cultivating many outstanding university students to be successors. But what is the situation of today's university students? To be frank, the level of today's university students and their interest in studying knowledge are both lower than before the war! This cannot be entirely blamed on young people. In fact, there are too few professors leading research, not to mention the lack of tools and the problem of livelihood. Therefore, most young people are full of worries and depression. Being able to flip through textbooks and copy notebooks is considered a hardworking student. However, some people in society who only know a few words, scheming and scheming, or who can remember accounts and run businesses are "high officials and powerful horses" or "rich and well-fed." Institutions rarely use talent as the main criterion for employing people. "Selecting the virtuous and entrusting the capable" is just a plaque hanging in the Examination Yuan. The general social situation is like this. Young people are sensitive, easily influenced, and imitative. They understand today's society. How many people are willing to pay attention to scholarship and be able to "stand out from the crowd" without being eroded by the evil forces of society? This is truly a great hidden worry for the future of scholarship.</p>
<p>The emptiness of academic research institutions is such that scientists working abroad have difficulty working once they return home, and research personnel suffer on the brink of starvation. If this continues, when will we be able to catch up with the scientific research of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union? Thinking about the future of scholarship in our nation really makes people worry and sleepless nights!</p>

Meanwhile, Jinnah, Governor-General of the Dominion of Pakistan, was also sworn in at 9:30 this morning at the Government Assembly Hall in Karachi. After the swearing-in ceremony, Mountbatten went to the Parliament Hall where the Constituent Assembly was located to read out the British King's edict, urging the two dominions to live in peace with each other from now on and shoulder the great task. Mountbatten also told the Constituent Assembly that he was prepared to resign as Governor-General in April next year, allowing Indians to take over the post, as the Indian leaders had already chosen March 31, 1948, as the end date of the transitional period when the draft of the Indian Independence Act was discussed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, August 15] Cities and villages in India and Pakistan celebrated the birth of the two dominions at midnight this morning with firecrackers, chimes, and salutes.

Governor-General Mountbatten ceased to be the Governor-General of India and became the Governor-General of the Dominion of India from midnight, while Jinnah also became the Governor-General of the Dominion of Pakistan. The 72-year-old Gandhi, on the other hand, fasted for 24 hours in Calcutta, spinning yarn and praying at home all day. Prime Minister Nehru of the Dominion of India issued a message to the 300 million people of the Dominion of India, pointing out that today is a day bestowed by fate. Hindus and Muslims in Calcutta traveled back and forth in the streets in various vehicles, celebrating India's independence together. Hindu and Muslim believers held each other's arms, singing and dancing wildly, forgetting the recent great riots. Even the houses of Muslims were hung with the national flag of Hindustan. The police did not receive any reports of ethnic clashes all day. The sirens of factories, trains, and ships in Mumbai sounded in unison at midnight to welcome the birth of the new country. Men, women, old and young have all forgotten their racial hatred and spent the night in revelry.</p>

I have fully understood the truth of the entire case and believe that both the police and military police should bear considerable responsibility.

<h3>Action Headquarters Invites the Supervisory Office and District Prosecutor's Office to Thoroughly Investigate Suspected Corruption Cases; Director Huo to Release Truth of Facts Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the news of accusations against six senior officials of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) was revealed, the spokesperson of CNRRA told our reporter last night, "CNRRA has formally invited the Supervisory Yuan and the District Prosecutor's Office to send people to thoroughly investigate and clarify the truth." Director Huo Baoshu originally intended to release a written report titled "Truth of Facts" at 6:00 PM yesterday, but due to the urgency of time and lack of preparation, it was postponed to today. Director Huo released a written statement yesterday, the full text of which is as follows: "The work of CNRRA has nothing that cannot be made public. Regarding the handling of money and materials, in addition to the accounting personnel dispatched by the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government stationed at the office to handle all accounts, the allocation, transportation, sale, and management of materials are all handled in consultation with UNRRA according to the treaty, and foreign staff participate in the actual work of various departments of this office. Because all business is conducted under the constraints of the treaty and government regulations, I dare to take full responsibility for the affairs of the entire office. After the irresponsible secret reports in the newspapers were published, the senior officials who were falsely accused have requested a thorough investigation from me. The investigation procedure is currently underway, and this office welcomes relevant supervisory agencies to come to the office for investigation to make all facts public. I personally believe that it is not easy to serve the public in a situation of confusion between right and wrong. Especially at the time when CNRRA is about to end, it is extremely difficult to maintain the continued work of loyal and outstanding cadres. I hope that the law and public opinion will provide guarantees and sympathy for public officials who serve loyally. As for irresponsible anonymous accusations, if the facts prove that they are malicious slander, this office has the right to prosecute."</p>
<p>Deputy Director Li Zhuomin told reporters from various newspapers: all accusations against him personally are unfounded. Not long ago, the Control Yuan investigated the "extravagant and wasteful" aspect of his residence and found it to be inaccurate. His residence is indeed very spacious, but it was allocated by the Enemy Property Administration and shared with the former director Jiang Tingfu. In the past, he personally approved that no senior official should borrow any materials transported by UNRRA, and this principle is still being followed. However, he believes that the current accusations are not without cause, so he will thoroughly investigate the clues disclosed by the accusers step by step.</p>
<p>The reporter also met with CNRRA spokesperson Bao Guangzhao yesterday, who said: "The sale of electric fans was handled in conjunction with UNRRA personnel. If there is any wrongdoing, Washington will disclose it first. This matter was investigated by the Supervisory Yuan two weeks ago and found to be inaccurate. The General Affairs Department has more than three cars, but they are official cars for colleagues to use for official business. Li Zhuomin's residence was formerly the official residence of Director Jiang. Director Huo did not move in after taking office. When the directors of various branch offices come to Shanghai, they also stay here, which is no different from a guest house. The two Min boxes originally belonged to the official residence of Wang Ni, so today they are still national property, and it is reasonable to take them back for use. CNRRA has formally invited the Supervisory Office and the District Prosecutor's Office to send people to thoroughly investigate this case today to clarify the truth."</p>
<h3>Inspector Yan Attaches Importance to Secret Reports</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of corruption secretly reported to the Supervisory Office and the District Prosecutor's Office against CNRRA Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and six others has received great attention from all parties since it was published in the newspapers. Yesterday, Inspector Yan told reporters: The Supervisory Office never accepts anonymous secret reports. The informant in this case left a real name and detailed address, so this office attaches great importance to this case and is currently investigating it. If the alleged allegations are true, this office will severely punish them according to the law. The criminal responsibility part should be investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office. He also said: Before the whole case is investigated and clarified, I do not intend to express any opinion.</p>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Huang's Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office was visited and asked about the secret report of corruption against CNRRA Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and others. Chief Huang said: "A few days ago, I received a secret report letter, the content of which was similar to that reported in the newspaper. Because it was not signed and no evidence was attached, I did not actively investigate it." The reporter asked: "If the number of electric fans applied for by the China Merchants Bureau and the number allocated by CNRRA are consistent, can this be used as a basis for investigation?" Chief Huang said: "It seems inappropriate to investigate the two agencies based solely on a secret report. However, if there is concrete evidence attached, such as account books, photos, etc., it can be used as a basis for investigation. In short, this office pays close attention to corruption cases. If a responsible person makes an accusation in his own name and attaches evidence, this office is responsible for investigating it. All I can tell you now is this."</p>
<h3>CNRRA Cars Not Running, Rice Allowances Not Issued, Drivers Threaten Work Stoppage</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday, no CNRRA vehicles were seen on the road. It is reported that this was due to the failure to pay wages in full, which led to a joint work stoppage by all drivers. However, a senior CNRRA official said in the evening: "Because the procedures for receiving rice allowances could not be completed for a while, the rice allowances could not be issued at the same time as the wages. The drivers were dissatisfied, so there was an expression of a work stoppage. However, by 4:00 PM, the drivers had returned to the garage, and this dispute is expected to be resolved."</p>
<h3>Merchant Ships of Countries with Reciprocal Treaties Are Prohibited from Coastal Trade in Our Country</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that merchant ships of countries that have signed reciprocal treaties with our country may continue to enter more than one port in our country after March 31, 1947, to unload passengers and cargo loaded from overseas, and may also transport passengers and cargo overseas, but may not engage in coastal trade.</p>
<h3>Hindering Military Service, Assaulting Bao Secretary</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chen Shuhua, a resident of No. 15, Jia 18, Bao 45, Tilanqiao District, is a recruit of conscription age in active service. According to law, he should fill out the register of men of conscription age after conducting a household survey, so that it can be sent for review and transfer. When Bao Secretary Gao Xiang and others went to investigate, Chen falsely claimed to be 28 years old. After investigation, it was found that he was born on June 25, 1923. He was reprimanded for falsely reporting his age, and an argument broke out between the two parties. Gao Xiang was assaulted. Wu Ying, the district chief of Tilanqiao District, reported the above situation to the municipal government. The municipal government, on the grounds that Chen had violated the regulations on hindering military service, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday requesting that the case be summoned for investigation.</p>
<p>The Youngest Captured Bandit Soldier (Our Photo)</p>
<h3>Captured Bandit Soldiers from the Northeast Escorted to Shanghai, to Continue Training in Wuhan Today, Expressing Gratitude for the Government's Generosity</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In recent years, the National Army has successively captured many bandit officers and soldiers in the Northeast. The authorities specially established the Northeast Youth Training Corps, under which there are twelve brigades, to provide training, collectively known as youth training students. Among them, 1,800 students from the 4th and 9th brigades, escorted by the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the Military Police, arrived in Huludao by Shangyang train, and took the China Merchants Bureau's "Hai Zhou" ship to Shanghai that night. They arrived at Wusongkou the night before, and berthed at Qiujiang Wharf at noon yesterday. Today, they will transfer to the "Jiang Xin" ship and then sail</p>
<p>Forced to Become Bandits, Accounted for the Majority</p>
<p>When the ship berthed, all the students gathered on the deck to watch the surrounding scenery, with expressions of comfort on their faces. According to the person in charge of the two teams, half of them are from the Northeast, and there are also people from other provinces. The sources of their capture include those who surrendered during combat, those who were originally captured by the Communist bandits from the National Army, those who were captured by the National Army but have not yet been confirmed, those who were found in various cities to be spies of the bandit army, those who were originally puppet troops who revolted and were captured by the bandit army to fight, and those who were originally ordinary civilians who were forced to become bandits after being liberated and liquidated by the bandit army because they had no way to make a living. Among them, the latter accounted for the majority. In the 4th brigade, most of them are officers, from second lieutenant to major.</p>
<p>Subjected to Liquidation, Family Property Gone</p>
<p>They have been training in Shenyang for several months. Each person, regardless of rank, is given the same treatment as the National Army, and 3,000 Northeast circulating vouchers, equivalent to 34,500 yuan in national currency, are issued as pocket money each month. After several months of training, they have a genuine understanding of the concept of the country, and their thoughts have changed. After arriving in Hankou, they will continue to be trained. How to supplement and equip them in the future will be the responsibility of the Wuhan Military Camp. According to students Wang Hanwen and Zhu Qingfu, after the September 18 Incident, they were forced to become puppet troops. After the revolt, they opened a bean flour factory at home, which was quite large. After the Eighth Route Army arrived in the Northeast, their family property was liquidated, their family members were harmed by the bandits, and individuals were forced to fight. This time, they were captured. They deeply thank the government for its understanding and generosity. In the future, they are willing to serve in the National Army and return to the Northeast to wipe out the bandits.</p>

<h3>News of Dance Ban Spreads, Employees Feel Great Anxiety, Chairman of the Dance Industry Association Says, Rather Restore Past Taxation Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the authorities announced that they would implement a conditional dance ban from next month, the dance hall industry, musicians, and dance industry employees all plan to hold meetings in the coming days and make suggestions to the authorities. There are currently more than 3,000 dance hall employees in this city. According to a representative of the employees' union: at the beginning of their organization of the union, they originally used the name "Western Restaurant and Cafe Industry Workers' Union". Later, because the Social Bureau solemnly stated that the dance industry would definitely not be banned in the short term, they changed the name to "Dance Hall Industry Workers' Union". Now that they have heard the news of the dance ban, they all feel anxious. They are currently all serving as waiters in the dance halls. If the dance ban is implemented as scheduled in the future, they will only be able to transfer to Western restaurants and cafes. However, most of the business of Western restaurants and cafes currently rely on the patronage of dancers and dance guests. Once the dance ban is implemented, the original waiters and employees will all have problems, and they will be in danger of losing their jobs, so they sincerely hope that the authorities will consider this.</p>
<p>Related Stores Will Be Affected</p>
<p>Sun Hongyuan, chairman of the Dance Hall Industry Association, said that the original intention of the dance ban was to promote thrift, but thousands of dance girls in the city have no other skills. If they become prostitutes and "social butterflies" in the future, it will only create gambling and waste outside the dance halls, and it will not achieve the purpose of thrift. Now that brothels have not been explicitly banned, and dance halls are eliminated first, it seems to be putting the cart before the horse. If the thousands of employees who directly depend on dance halls for their livelihood are calculated based on three family members who need to be supported per person, then tens of thousands of people in the city will have no way to make a living. What's more, the fashion stores, barbershops, shoe stores, entertainment industries, and even rickshaw pullers that are indirectly related to the dance industry will also suffer great impact.</p>
<p>Rather Than Banning, Better to Increase Taxes</p>
<p>The donations and taxes currently paid by dance halls account for an important part of the city's financial revenue. Rather than completely banning them, it is better to change the current tax rate of 25% and restore the previous 40% or 50% to show restrictions, which seems to be more beneficial to the city's financial situation. If it is said that dancing consumes too many materials, but after the dance halls are eliminated, they will be converted into Western restaurants and cafes, etc., and it seems that it may not be possible to save electricity and other things. Therefore, if the authorities want to ban dancing, they should consider all these issues.</p>
<p>The Musicians' Union will also hold a meeting on the 19th to discuss the matter. Many of the current musicians are recent graduates of music colleges. They said that what they have learned is music. If dance halls cannot exist, they can also make a living by playing in other places, because the current treatment is meager, and both foreign and Chinese musicians are deeply tired of playing in dance halls.</p>

Pan Gongzhan, Xuan Tiewu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, and Wang Xiaolai asked the gentlemen to introduce it solemnly, and it is expected that the business will develop rapidly.</p>
<h3>Selling False Warehouse Receipts, Cotton Cloth Owner Sued on Two Charges</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Cotton cloth broker Yin Dingfu opened Baoxiang Cotton Cloth Shop in this city. In early June, Yin could not make up for his failed speculation, so he used Baoxiang's name to forge the delivery orders of Yonghua Factory. On the 12th, 13th, and 14th, he sold a large number of false Longtou fine cloth warehouse receipts, defrauding 13.02 million yuan from Tonghexing Cotton Cloth Shop, 12.72 million yuan from Yongsheng Cotton Cloth Shop, 12.74 million yuan from Yonghua Cotton Cloth Shop, 38.1 million yuan from Baokangshen Grain Shop, 47.12 million yuan from Fuqunxiang Cotton Cloth Shop, and 12.74 million yuan from Tongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Shop. On the 22nd of the same month, because the grain shop could not deliver the goods, they questioned the shareholders one after another. In desperation, the shareholder opened a room in Ningxing Inn and committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills, but failed. After investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, he was prosecuted for fraud and forgery. The case has been sent to the criminal court of the district court for handling.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Weng Meizhen, a woman living at No. 28, Lane 61, Meibai Ge Road, ordered 500 dozen Shunfeng brand large bottles of soda from the Shanghai Meihua Soda Factory at No. 1479 Yuguo Road a few months ago, and only received more than 100 dozen. She negotiated with the introducer, and Zhang Guohua (23-year-old Ningbo native, volunteer police officer of Changning Police Station) of the factory signed a check for more than 4 million yuan in legal tender as a settlement last month. However, the check could not be cashed when it expired. Weng was very angry and went to Zhang for a theory. Zhang agreed to come to Weng's place in person to solve the problem. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30, Zhang arrived as scheduled, but unexpectedly, a conflict broke out between the two parties. Zhang, who was young and energetic, took out a pistol to show off. Weng immediately reported the robbery to the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau. The criminal section chief Ding Xinjin led police officers in a police car to the scene and learned the whole story. Zhang was also taken to the bureau for questioning. However, the residents in the area, seeing a large number of police officers rushing out of the lane with guns and live ammunition, had already been frightened.</p>
<h3>Resenting the Collection Conflict, Reporting the Money Shop's Illegal Activities</h3>

Zhu refused to pay, and a conflict broke out. Zhu broke Zhang's head and twisted each other into the Huangpu Police Station, which was punished for violating police regulations for adding violence. However, Zhu was still resentful and explained the reason for the arrears.

<h3>Refugees from Northern Jiangsu Gather on the Highlands, Soybeans, Sesame, and Miscellaneous Grains Are All Submerged, Wang Gong Cables Shanghai to Report the Disaster</h3>
<p>Wang Maogong, chairman of Jiangsu Province, recently sent cables to all parties in this city and fellow Jiangsu natives in Shanghai during his inspection of the flood in northern Jiangsu, reporting the disaster, which roughly said: The disaster in each county and city of Xuzhou District has spread throughout the entire area. Refugees gather on the highlands, and food is empty. Tall plants are also broken and destroyed by summer rain and cold, and storms. Houses have collapsed, and it is roughly estimated that there are tens of thousands of them. Only one-tenth or two of the 4 million people in Xuzhou District are spared from starvation. Groups of them are fleeing the famine, and the tragic situation is alarming. On both sides of the railway in Tongxu District, the beans, sesame, peanuts, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains that have been submerged by water have all withered and died. Sorghum is also unlikely to be harvested. There are no turnip seeds for near places, and there is nothing to replant. Famine refugees are on the road one after another. If they cannot obtain food locally, they will inevitably flee to Jiangnan.</p>

<h3>Director of Welfare Group Wounded in Office of the General Affairs Department of the Administrative Yuan, Accuses Director of General Affairs Department of Exceeding Authority</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Xu Shichang, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Administrative Yuan, was recently sued by Ms. Liu Dewei, the Director of the Welfare Group of the Relief and Rehabilitation Office, for administrative overreach, accusing Xu of interfering in administration and publicly assaulting Liu in the office. The incident stemmed from the morning before, when 397 refugees from the rear areas gathered inside the office, demanding relief. Due to misunderstandings in the work of the staff, conflicts arose. Afterwards, according to Liu Dewei speaking to the reporter: "My work is absolutely impartial, and relief matters have their own specialties. Now, the Director of the General Affairs Department not only overstepped his authority to interfere but also publicly cursed me as a 'mixed-up bastard,' and then started hitting people. This is really too much bullying." Liu described this behavior as entirely due to "jealousy." Finally, Liu firmly stated: "If the administrative lawsuit yields no results, I will file a legal lawsuit." While speaking, she also presented the injury report to the reporter as evidence.</p>
<h3>Epoch-Making Progress in Police Administration: Using Scientific Methods to Investigate Criminal Evidence, Ultraviolet Light is the Most Powerful</h3>
<p>[Our Special Dispatch] Since the police bureau used "ultraviolet light" to determine criminal evidence in the case of the shooting of Yu Shengxiao, the outside world has been very interested in the various scientific methods recently used by the police bureau to solve cases. A reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau and learned that the investigation of criminals and the identification of evidence have completely abandoned torture and are now using various latest scientific methods to conduct inquiries, so that criminals will confess in the face of the power of science and cannot make excuses.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet light is one of the most effective, specifically used to detect various subtle pieces of criminal evidence that are invisible to the naked eye, such as forged documents and seals, counterfeit banknotes, and imitation goods. Because ultraviolet light is completely based on the principle of optical perspective, even cleverly crafted counterfeits or destroyed and unrecognizable originals can be identified under this super-intensity light. For example, if you compare and inspect a popular brand of brandy with the real product under ultraviolet light, the differences in concentration, composition, and liquid form can be immediately distinguished. The three fake seals of the bank that was defrauded of a huge sum of money by counterfeit checks were also detected by ultraviolet light. The differences between them and the original seals were only in one or two knife marks, which could not be seen with the naked eye.</p>
<p>Finding Clues Based on Fingerprints</p>
<p>Fingerprint identification, which is related to ultraviolet light, is one of the most arduous tasks in the police bureau's investigation work. Currently, the fingerprint unit has more than 600,000 pages of ten-finger prints and more than 100,000 single-finger prints, all of which are criminal fingerprints accumulated over the years since the era of the Public Works Department, as well as those left at the scene of incidents that have not yet been solved. For example, in the case of the corpse at Taishan Apartments, which caused a sensation in Shanghai some time ago, and the theft case at He Yingqin's mansion, the clues were found within a few days or even hours through the fingerprints, and the cases were finally solved. Now, all fingerprints are analyzed and categorized according to the latest American classification method and managed by experts. If a case occurs, in order to find out whether the criminal is a first-time offender or a repeat offender, or if it is necessary to compare the fingerprints left at the scene, the files are often repeatedly turned over and compared by type with the fingerprints in the files, which takes the most time.</p>
<p>Stereoscopic Photography and Invisible Photography</p>
<p>Photography is also quite important in the investigation process. After a case occurs, criminals, scenes, documents, and evidence must be photographed and preserved. The police bureau currently has two types of photography: "stereoscopic photography" and "invisible photography," and its equipment is second to none in the Far East. "Stereoscopic photography" is used to photograph various angles other than the front, and "invisible photography" can make the required point of photography particularly clear, while the remaining parts are automatically hidden during photography. This type of photography is often the most powerful aid when interrogating criminals or seeking clues.</p>
<p>Checking Bullet Casings to Identify the Gun Owner</p>
<p>There are currently registered self-defense firearms in Shanghai. All such firearms are recorded by the Firearms Inspection Unit of the Third Division. Because firearms of the same brand have slight differences in their structure, if a shooting incident occurs in the city, based on the recovered bullet, the depth and width of the rifling lines, or the impact marks of the firing pin on the cartridge case, and determining the up, down, left, and right positions of the impact, and then using the most precise calculation method to cross-reference with the rotation of the rifling lines and the position of the firing pin in the original record, the gun owner can be determined immediately.</p>
<p>Hair and Blood Stains Can All Be Examined</p>
<p>In addition, the department also has a forensic laboratory, specializing in the examination of hair, blood stains, corpses, and injuries, in order to match the aforementioned scientific methods and comprehensively identify the appearance, character, and criminal process of the offender.</p>
<p>Investigating crimes using scientific methods is an epoch-making progress in Chinese police administration. The Municipal Police Bureau is planning to enrich this scientific equipment and strive to achieve "no injustice, no letting go," so that criminal behavior can be gradually reduced in the face of the power of science in the future.</p>

<h3>Silent Kuling</h3>
<p>White Clouds Encircle Ten Thousand-Ren Mountains [News from the Eleventh] Climbing up to this ten thousand-ren high mountain from the hot and bustling capital, surrounded by white clouds, we cannot smell a trace of political atmosphere, hear half a sound of the city's noise, or see a speck of flying dust, giving us a feeling of "riding the wind and returning."</p>
<p>"Longing to hate the return of spring with no place to be found, I don't know that it turns people to come here," (Bai Letian's poem) is the most appropriate description of the beauty of this place. Here, the reporter only wants to briefly introduce some mountain trivia, which is regarded as revealing the silent face of Lushan:</p>
<p>Mountain People Long for the Chairman's Arrival</p>
<p>Kuling has become the name of a historical and political summer capital. The Lushan training sessions before the war, the Lushan Conference, and even Chairman Chiang's Lushan broadcasts are all major events in China's recent hundred-year history. The residents of Kuling are forever proud of this and forever reminiscing about the grand occasions of those years. After the war, last year, the occasional visits of Chairman Chiang and the weekend visits of the peace envoy Marshall attracted more than 20 reporters from various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai to be stationed in Kuling for a long time, trying to send out world-shaking news from this gentle mountain every day. The coming and going of dignitaries and the strong political atmosphere almost made the warm Kuling excessively heated and tense. Although Kuling suffered a major fire disaster this spring, they still yearn for a more heated scene than last year's. The sound of "When will the Chairman come to Lushan?" is endless. However, when July ended, they began to sigh, "I'm afraid the Chairman won't come." The reporter went up the mountain on August 7 and was constantly answering inquiries from acquaintances and strangers asking, "When will the Chairman come?" At the same time, I heard them saying to each other, "I'm afraid there is no hope," "I'm afraid he won't come." The mountain people look forward to the Chairman's visit as if they were looking forward to their loving mother. However, today is already August 11, and the possibility of this hope has been reduced to the lowest possible degree.</p>
<p>Wind Roars and Streams Sing, Talking About the Official Residence</p>
<p>The Chairman's opulent residence quietly stands beside the stream, surrounded by a wall and a large lawn in front of the house. The mountain people pointed and told me that last year they could very proudly see Chairman Chiang and his beautiful wife walking on this lawn. They used extremely vivid adjectives beyond the power of words to describe their intimate feelings about the Chairman and his wife's every move. However, now it is deserted, and except for the sentries standing at the front and back doors, no sound can be heard. The location of the Chairman's official residence is excellent, with the avenue in front, a winding path behind, and a babbling stream passing from the foot of the wall. Waking up in the middle of the night, it is really the wind roaring and the stream singing, with a majestic meaning in the pulse of clear poetry.</p>
<p>Ashes After Burning, Endowing New Life</p>
<p>From a fire in Kuling this spring, we can still see the ruins of broken walls everywhere today. The fire destroyed part of the essence of Kuling, but because it has this political value, it has been revived and recreated. Therefore, the ruins have been given a new life, and the government authorities and merchants themselves have tried to invest a lot of capital to rebuild it. The Jiangxi Provincial Government, which is responsible for receiving guests, has especially tried its best to improve the facilities this year, taking last year as an example. Wu Shihan, Director of the Lushan Administration Bureau, and Wang Jiongguang, Executive Director of the Social Service Department, both went up the mountain early to design and plan. The Social Service Department also specially rented a large house, with a pavilion-style apartment building, as well as a dining room, barber shop, bathroom, and library, all of which provide many conveniences for tourists. Last year, the reporters mainly stayed at the Hujinfang Hotel, which was also a large hotel with ninety rooms, but it has been overshadowed a lot this year. The reporters have moved to the Social Apartments of the Social Service Department. Everything in this year's summer capital is more improved than last year.</p>
<p>Nerve Center, Feeling Sensitive</p>
<p>General Marshall once said in Lushan that "Kuling's telecommunications will be second to none in the world." But if General Marshall visits again this year, he may also be amazed. A long-distance phone call, as long as you call for two minutes, the bell will ring, the sound is clear, there are many lines, and there are wired and wireless radios, all kinds of equipment. The speed and seriousness of its work make people admire it. Mail is also delivered quickly, the post office facilities are top-notch, and postal workers often take responsibility for guiding the villagers to send letters. These can be said to be the nerve center of Kuling.</p>
<p>Kuling is already showing a scene of autumn, and summer has disappeared in silence. This is exactly symbolic of the reality of this year's summer capital.</p>
<h3>Director of the Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Bureau Discusses the Construction of a New Alpine Meteorological Station: Focusing on the Study of the Sun as a Central Topic</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Taipei, 15th] After Director Shi Yanhan of the Meteorological Bureau and Huang Renyu, a technician, inspected the Xingaoshan Meteorological Station and surveyed the old site of the observatory built by the predecessors, he said: "Except for India and Mexico, astronomical observatories are mostly located in the northern temperate zone. If constructed in the subtropical zone, it has the following advantages: (1) Can witness the southern celestial sphere's fixed stars. (2) There is no obstruction on the horizon. (3) There is little dust, and the observation of weather balloons has no flickering defects. (4) The number of observations can be increased by two and a half times compared to the plains." He also emphasized: "The station can take the sun as its central research topic, such as observing sunspots and solar radiation intensity, and at the same time build an Einstein field to study the composition of the sun. Because the station is located on the Tropic of Cancer, with a higher altitude, it can obtain conclusions that are not easily obtained by other astronomical observatories." He is preparing to submit it to the current astronomical annual meeting to be held in September, hoping to use the power of the state to build the current Xingaoshan Meteorological Station.</p>
<h3>Adapting to the National General Mobilization Order: Zhejiang Province Forms People's Self-Defense Forces</h3>

<h3>West Lake Water Will Be Opened Tomorrow to Appropriately Irrigate Farmland Along the Shangtang River</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, 15th] Due to prolonged drought, farmland in Hangzhou and Haining is short of water.

<h3>A Humorous Scene in Hefei: Xia Yinglin's Official Addiction is Unbearable, Secretly Prints "Director" Business Cards</h3>
<p>Cuts and Wraps a Large Batch of Clothing, Expecting to Take Office Immediately, but the Truth is Discovered and He is Detained in the Police Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Hefei] A humorous scene occurred in Hefei today, which spread throughout the bland ancient city. A man named Xia Yinglin, a native of Hefei, 26 years old, bought a large batch of clothing in a cloth shop on the crossroads. After the shop assistant cut and wrapped it, Xia claimed that he was about to take over as the director of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau and took out a business card with the full title. The guard, who was on duty and had not heard of any changes in the directorship, ignored him, but Xia slapped him. The guard was bewildered and lured Xia to the nearby First Branch Bureau and reported it to the Branch Director Lai Ting. Lai Ting saw that Xia was wearing a half-old shirt and shorts, which did not look like a director about to take office, and there was no such news. After searching, dozens of business cards of "Xia Yinglin, Director of the Anhui Provincial Capital Police Bureau" were found on Xia, as well as a letter notifying news reporters that "The handover ceremony of the new and old directors will be held at X o'clock on the morning of August X in the auditorium of the Police Bureau," and "By the order of Chairman Li, I will be in charge of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, and I am overwhelmed with trepidation after being appointed." Branch Director Lai then sent Xia to the Criminal Police Team and forwarded him to the General Bureau. When the reporter went to the detention center of the General Bureau to visit this impostor director, a person wearing a vest and underpants stood up on the floor inside the wooden fence and hurriedly put on brand-new yellow leather shoes, as if he had a premonition. He first said, "I am Xia Yinglin, are you a news reporter?" Then he narrated his life experience, saying that he had worked as a typist and clerk, and had recently acted as the director of the Third Branch Bureau of Wuhu. When asked if he was from the police force and what relationship he had with the director of the Wuhu Police Bureau, he replied: "I only graduated from elementary school and don't know Lu at all." As for coming to Hefei, it was because the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government passed a resolution to appoint him as the director of the Provincial Capital Police Bureau, and the original director Lin Chao was appointed as the county magistrate, so he came to Hefei to print business cards. When the reporter told him that the provincial government had never issued such an order, Xia seemed to suddenly realize something. In his words, he rambled incoherently, and his insanity was very similar to that of a person suffering from a mental illness. It is reported that the Police Bureau is currently investigating his background and will decide what to do with him.</p>

<h3>Fuzhou Shoushan Stone: Reserves Reach 3 Billion Tons and Can Be Used as Industrial Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Fuzhou, 11th] Our country is famous for producing seal stones. They include Guanglv stone from Guangdong Province, Qingtian stone from Zhejiang Province, Changhua's chicken blood stone, and Shoushan stone from Fujian Province. Among them, Shoushan stone has the most brilliant colors and is the crown of seal stones in various provinces. As early as 1848, Shoushan stone was sold to Europe and the United States and was deeply welcomed by Westerners. The chemical composition of Shoushan stone is mica and potassium, aluminum, silicon, and acid salts. According to its aluminum and silicon elements, it is suitable for the manufacture of kiln industry, such as ceramic utensils, refractory bricks and tiles, glass industry, enamel industry, and other refractory materials, or for the steel manufacturing industry, metallurgical industry, alloy industry, gas industry, and mechanical industry. Therefore, seal stones can not only be used for appreciation by literati, but also as raw materials for scientific manufacturing. They are truly very useful minerals.</p>
<p>Shoushan Township and Yueyang Township in Fuzhou both produce Shoushan stone, and the distribution area is vast. The Shoushan stone deposit can be divided into three major areas: Shoushan, Yueyang, Furong, and Emei. The bedrock that constitutes the mountains in the entire area is mostly quartz porphyry, and the seal stone is nurtured in it. The reserves are about 3 billion tons, of which 2 billion tons are above the water level and 1 billion tons are below the water level. The mineral quality is excellent and has the value of mining.</p>

<h3>Students of Beiping Normal College Demanded the Restoration of National Fudan University Yesterday. Education Minister Zhu Jiahua Was Besieged. Hu Shih Arrived and Resolved the Situation.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 15th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, who is in Beiping today, was besieged by students from the Normal College demanding the restoration of Fudan University. He was trapped for an hour and eventually managed to escape through a side door. In the afternoon, more than two hundred students from the Normal College secretly gathered at Peking University. When Zhu Jiahua inspected the science building of Peking University at 4:30 PM, it was too late. Despite Secretary Fang Zhimou's best efforts to lure him away, he was still surrounded by the students. Just as he was about to board his car, the students blocked the car and demanded that he give a speech and provide guarantees regarding the restoration of Fudan University before they would allow him to leave. He remained by the car for more than ten minutes, and the students shouted rude remarks, emphasizing that Zhu's refusal to speak was bureaucratic arrogance. Zhu looked very unhappy and could not break through the encirclement and returned to the university. The students followed and shouted, "We will seek the restoration of Fudan University even if we die!" Although Peking University personnel repeatedly attempted to lure the students into a side room, they were unsuccessful. This continued until the last courtyard, where Minister Zhu took refuge in the physics department office. However, the students were still agitated, and Minister Zhu finally came out and gave a speech to the students, saying, "It is not that I do not want to talk to you, but I feel that this method is not good. To discuss official matters, you should make an appointment in advance. As for the Fudan University issue, I have already made an appointment with President Hao Renfu of the Normal College (Director of the Tianjin Education Bureau). Tomorrow night, I will exchange views with student representatives at the Normal College and then discuss the matter further. We should study it calmly. The Ministry of Education has administrative regulations, and I cannot make decisions on my own." At this point, the students shouted for a final decision. President Hu Shih of Peking University arrived upon hearing the news and stepped forward to resolve the situation. Hu said: As an alumnus of the Normal College (Hu once studied at the former Higher Normal School), I have been concerned about the restoration of Fudan University for a long time, and I have mediated on its behalf. A month ago, I forwarded Minister Zhu's letter to the Normal College. At that time, Minister Zhu expressed sympathy in his letter, which was written in black and white and should be trustworthy. (Both Zhu and Hu, as well as the students, said that the only problem was the procedure; the direction was set, but Minister Zhu could not explicitly say so). At this time, Secretary Fang and all the Peking University personnel mobilized and sought out student representatives to persuade them using the "divide and conquer" method. The students were not satisfied and wanted Zhu and Hu to make a definite guarantee. Hu nodded helplessly, but Zhu refused, leading to another deadlock. Hu took the lead and led Zhu out, but the students closed the door tightly, and Zhu and Hu were quite angry but could not return to the room. After a while, Hu came out again to negotiate with the students. The students demanded that Hu ask the Minister to sign a guarantee that he would go to the Normal College tomorrow night, and then they would leave. Hu angrily said, "It is outrageous for you to make such a request. How can I, as a landlord, do such a rude thing? You should consider it and not lose the sympathy of those who support you. I am scared of this kind of method, let alone Minister Zhu." At this time, the students discovered that Minister Zhu had escaped through a side door under Dr. Hu Shih's "golden cicada sheds its shell" scheme, and they had no choice but to shake hands with Hu Shih and make a guarantee, and then withdrew together. It was already past 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Student Petition Group</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 15th] In addition to inspecting Fu Jen Catholic University and Peking University, Minister Zhu Jiahua also met with the responsible persons of Hebei Provincial College of Engineering, Beiyang University, and Railway College today to discuss matters. Students from the Judicial Group of Qiyang College petitioned because the Ministry of Education had stopped issuing public funds, but to no avail. Representatives from the "North China Student Union" also met with Zhu and raised three points for reply: (1) Regarding the U.S. Marine Corps' revocation of Pearson's original sentence, they asked Zhu to express his attitude as a parental figure; (2) Please increase education funding (including improving the salaries of teachers and staff and issuing public funds to new students); (3) Please pay attention to and investigate the dismissal of professors at Shanghai Jiaotong University and other schools.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Nine Transferred Military Officers Assigned to Posts in This City by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] Previously, the authorities established re-training classes for demobilized military officers in 12 locations including Shanghai and Xi'an by the China Training Corps. After completing their studies, they were assigned to relevant agencies by the Executive Yuan upon approval by the Ministry of National Defense. Among them, 29 graduates of the education personnel training class were assigned to the Education Bureau of this city by the Ministry of Education, 15 were introduced to serve in various national schools by the National Education Department, 9 were placed by the Social Education Department, and 5 were recorded by the Secondary Education Department. However, because the training classes ended at the end of May, and the salary was paid until the end of July, the accommodation problem can still be solved, but the food expenses are barely maintained until now. Moreover, some of those introduced to serve in national schools were rejected by the principals on the grounds that the personnel had already been determined. The batch of transferred military officers went to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday afternoon, requesting that a portion of their wages be paid in advance to maintain their livelihood. Vice Director Li received them at that time, replied: Since they have been assigned to the Education Bureau, the Education Bureau will naturally be responsible and will contact the relevant parties within the day to make a decision. Vice Director Li also instructed the transferred military officers that if they have any disputes with the schools to which they have been assigned, they should not argue verbally but can directly appeal to the Education Bureau or find ways to transfer to other schools. The transferred military officers also stated that when they retired from the military, they mostly engaged in political propaganda work, which is similar in nature to social education work. Many of those who have been assigned to serve in national schools also hope to serve in social education institutions. Vice Director Li promised to consider this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Social Education Department stated that the number of classes in various national schools will increase starting in September, and they can be assigned to serve at that time.

<h3>Philippine Tennis Player Anpon to Come to Shanghai for Competition: The Commission of Tennis Sports Association sponsors, Shanghai Tennis Association hosts</h3>
<p>According to Pan Youyuan and Wang Wenzheng of the Shanghai Tennis Association, Anpon, the Philippine tennis champion, and three or four other players plan to visit Shanghai. They have consulted the Tennis Committee of the Sports Association for their opinion. Zhao Minheng of the Tennis Committee expressed his welcome. After the Recreation Conference the other day, they exchanged views informally. According to Pan, Mr. Ilan, the President of the Philippine Sports Association, hopes to obtain the consent of the Municipal Tennis Committee before allowing Anpon to come. Zhao's opinion is that travel expenses are huge at the moment. The Tennis Committee is only responsible for sponsoring the event, and the travel expenses, accommodation, and competition matters of Anpon etc. should be the responsibility of the Shanghai Tennis Association. Pan expressed his agreement. In the future, the competition will be held at the Shanghai Association's courts. It is planned to set up stands. It is heard that after Anpon comes to Shanghai, he may participate in the city's Open Championship. According to Anpon, he came to Shanghai once before the war. After more than ten years of separation, his tennis skills have reached the peak. Last year, he traveled to the United States and participated in the Lishan U.S. Open and competitions in various continents, achieving remarkable results. If he can come to Shanghai this season, he will definitely refresh the city's tennis scene.</p>

<h3>Rubber Industry Lacks Raw Materials: Three Emergency Measures Proposed; Liberalize Quotas and Change Import and Export Trade Regulations; Priority Approval of Licenses for Overseas Remittances</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Rubber Industry Association of the First District, facing a shortage of raw materials and limited import quotas, making production difficult, yesterday hosted members of the local press. Hong Nianzu, Chairman of the Association, and other executive directors, presented reports on the current state of the industry. They stated that since the authorities implemented the import control system, rubber factories in Shanghai have only received quotas for over 2,600 tons of rubber. In the first half of this year, however, 150,000 dan (approximately 10,000 tons) of rubber were imported into our country from Hong Kong. Of this, about 70-80% was transshipped through Shanghai, which has allowed the Shanghai rubber industry to maintain production and supply. Since the implementation of the transshipment ban on July 1st, cargo transport between Hong Kong and Guangdong has been disrupted, and the quota for rubber and rubber products for the third quarter has been reduced by US$500,000. Chemical products and other raw materials are even more difficult to obtain. Without raw materials, factory workers will not be able to continue to survive. Therefore, they have recently submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, and the Import Control Office and other relevant agencies, proposing three emergency measures: (1) Significantly increase the quota for raw rubber and chemical products. (2) Change import and export trade regulations, allowing factories to directly apply for imports according to actual needs, or have the association handle it jointly. (3) If factories can find overseas remittances for the raw materials they need, issue permits as soon as possible. They also stated that if rubber factories are not allowed to seek their own means of survival, then in three months, we will see a market of dried fish.</p>
<p>Taiwan Rubber Factories Also Lack Raw Materials</p>
<p>[Another Report] At yesterday's reception hosted by the First District Rubber Association, Shen, Director of the Taiwan Rubber Factory of the Resources Committee, also attended. Shen strongly argued the importance of the rubber industry to both national defense and peacetime industry, and appealed to the government to include Taiwan in the allocation of quotas. He then reported on the recent situation of the rubber industry in Taiwan, stating that there are more than 50 rubber factories there, but the machinery and manpower of the Taiwan Rubber Factory account for 60% of the entire Taiwan rubber industry. The factory needs 360 to 400 tons of rubber per month, but currently can only obtain 30 tons per month, less than one-thirteenth of its needs. Given the excellent industrial production conditions in Taiwan, the government should fully support it.</p>

<h3>Balance of Foreign Exchange Deposits in Banks: A Small Number Still Not Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to Article 8 of the Amended Provisional Regulations for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange: "If there are remaining balances in the existing foreign exchange accounts of each bank, they should be sold to the National Bank at the market price on September 30, 1946." Has each designated bank fully sold all of the remaining balances in foreign exchange accounts? Should the foreign exchange deposits owned by commercial banks also be handled in accordance with the above regulations? The reporter inquired with relevant parties in the bank, and it was stated that if there are any remaining balances in the existing foreign currency deposit accounts of each designated bank, they should be sold to the bank at the market price on September 20, 1946. This regulation was originally notified by the bank to each designated bank for compliance. As of now, most of these foreign currency deposit accounts have been closed. There are still a small number of depositors who are scattered in various places and have lost contact with the original deposit banks, resulting in their inability to close on schedule. The bank is currently urging them to close as soon as possible. As for the foreign exchange positions owned by commercial banks, if they are in the country, they should also be sold to the bank at the market price on September 30, 1946, in accordance with the regulations. If they are abroad, they can be sold to the bank at the current exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation Cables Request for Removal of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Controls</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, in order to request the removal of the control on the transport of cotton yarn and cloth to and from the north and the south, to alleviate the plight of Jiangsu merchants, sent a cable to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Textile Adjustment Committee, stating that since the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth transshipment control, the export sales of cotton yarn and cloth industries in the city have stagnated, and production has been reduced. Moreover, according to reliable reports from northern and southern merchants, the South Seas have become the tail end of Japanese cotton cloth dumping, and have infiltrated South China through Hong Kong and Macau. Coastal ports in Jiangsu and Shandong have also seen the smuggling of Japanese goods, which are then transferred to North China. The special control on the transport of cotton yarn and cloth to and from the north and the south was originally intended to prevent smuggling abroad and to stabilize prices. Now, because of the opening of trade with Japan, Japanese goods are easily dumped, resulting in strict controls on national goods, which in turn allow Japanese goods to be smuggled into the country. This is neither an expedient solution nor a good plan. There is a need to change course. It is hoped that the facts will be investigated, and that the method of controlling the transshipment of cotton yarn and cloth to and from the north and the south will be abolished by explicit order in order to maintain domestic products and save the crisis.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Do Not Fluctuate Much</p>

<p>Cotton Cloth First Rises, Then Falls Back</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market: with the off-market Longtou fine cloth closing high at 425,000 yuan the previous day, all goods saw high openings. Tianjin merchants absorbed strongly, and floating longs rushed to cover shorts, and large buyers successively purchased. Longtou fine cloth soared to 450,000 yuan. It was then heard that the Four Banks and Two Bureaus would gradually recover production loans, and because trade with Japan was about to open, all parties were wary. Therefore, Longtou fine cloth finally fell back to 440,000 yuan, 30,000 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. However, asking prices softened after the close, with sellers at 436,000 yuan. The remaining cloths also first rose and then fell back.

<h3>Mr. Zhang Daofan's Fiftieth Birthday Preface</h3>
<p>— Jiang Weiqiao</p>
<p>Our country has a five-thousand-year-old culture, forming an ancient nation. However, throughout history, the world's fortunes have had periods of prosperity and decline, and culture has also risen and fallen accordingly. When it is in decline, there must be sages and heroes who rise up to revitalize it, causing the culture to shift its direction and radiate brilliant light. History records this in detail. The Tuan Commentary of the Book of Changes says: "Observe the celestial patterns to understand the changes of time, observe human culture to transform the world." The Four Subjects of Confucius' school also include all ritual and musical systems. This shows the richness and breadth of the meaning of culture. After the founding of the Republic of China, inheriting the decline and corruption of the late Qing Dynasty, coupled with long-term wars that continue to this day, the destruction and damage to culture have reached their extreme. There must be someone with a grand vision, who rises up and recognizes the vastness of culture, to save it. Looking around the country, Mr. Zhang Daofan is the one who can shoulder this important task!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was born in Pan County, Guizhou, in the Dingyou year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. His father, Mingqu Gong, taught in the countryside and was known for his integrity. His mother, Wu, was well-versed in etiquette and taught her son righteousness. Therefore, Mr. Zhang's filial piety and brotherly love were innate. Before reaching adulthood, he graduated from the county school and, with ambitions for the world, went to Tianjin to study at Nankai Middle School. Later, he studied in England and France, focusing on art, and integrating Chinese literature and science. He gained fame in England and was elected as a member of the Royal Society. After completing his studies, he returned to China and was immediately appointed. He initially served as the Secretary-General of the Nanjing Municipal Government, and later as the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Education, and Interior Affairs. He also served as the Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province. Having served in both domestic and foreign positions, his political achievements are well-known. He then served as a member of the Central Executive Committee, and after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he was elected as a Standing Committee member in Sichuan. He successively served as the Minister of both the Propaganda and Overseas Departments. In the spring of the thirtieth year, he also took charge of the Cultural Movement Committee. Mr. Zhang said with a sigh: "This is the time for me to put what I have learned into practice." He worked diligently, day and night, tirelessly, with the sole aim of promoting indigenous culture and bridging Western culture. As a result, learned scholars, artists, and writers all responded and sought him out, rising up at the sound of his call. In those four or five years, the cultural movement was like spring sunshine, with a hundred flowers blooming in full splendor, demonstrating a vast and inclusive view. Moreover, Mr. Zhang's vision was sharp, and his understanding of culture differed from ordinary people. In addition to promoting new and old literature and art, he also included drama, novels, and movies, embracing them all. His original plays include "Self-Deception," "Self-Salvation," and "Killing the Enemy to Save the Country," among others. His translations include "Di Si Niang" and "Honeymoon Trip." He also produced the movie "Secret Code," which was based on his personal revolutionary experiences and widely circulated. The magazines he founded include "Literary Vanguard" and "Cultural Vanguard." The series of books he edited include "Modern Literature" and "Modern Drama." Mr. Zhang also excels in both Chinese and Western painting, and his sketches have a unique style. The cultural organizations he initiated and organized include the Chinese Literature and Art Society, the All-China Literary and Art Circles Anti-Japanese Association, the All-China Drama Circles Anti-Japanese Association, the All-China Fine Arts Association, and the All-China Literary and Art Writers Association. This demonstrates the greatness of his measures, the universality of his actions, which have had a special impact on the entire country and even extended to the world. The number of Heaven is five, and the number of Earth is five, and the number of Great Expansion resides in the center of Heaven and Earth. Mr. Zhang has been blessed by Heaven, and at the young age of fifty, his achievements in governance have already been so evident. In the years to come, he will surely enable our country's culture to flourish throughout the world, which can be predicted. Mr. Zhang has made great contributions to the Party and the country, and historians will surely record and praise them. I need not add more. I have only briefly described his dedication to cultural undertakings to inform the people of the country and to celebrate his birthday! This is the preface. (July of the 36th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<h3>Ding Shan's Notes on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Chen Dingshan</p>
<p>"Shui Long Yin" Correct Meter</p>
<p>Xin Yuan gifted me a "Shui Long Yin" for my fiftieth birthday, and I responded with one. His ending line says, "Leaving the world with emerald ink, dreaming by the pine stream, sipping wine with a spoon." According to the rules of poetry, Xin Jiaxuan's poem ends with, "Who can I ask to call forth, red kerchiefs and green sleeves, to wipe away the tears of a hero?" The word "wipe" should be paused after. Xin Yuan's ending line says, "Planning to howl in Lantian, in the bamboo groves of Pepper Garden, together we will float away by boat." There should be a pause after the word "together." So Xin Yuan is right, and I was wrong. However, according to Su Shi's "Shui Long Yin" poem: "Looking closely, it's not willow catkins, but the tears of parting people." Lu You wrote, "Sighing that only willow catkins come with spring, mixed with hatred, filling the east wind." Bai Shi wrote, "Why does Xie Lang also hate drifting, understanding the moonlit thousands of miles." Both can be read as seven syllables followed by six syllables, just like Jiaxuan's "If someone could call forth red kerchiefs," "Green sleeves wipe away the tears of a hero." It can also be read as seven syllables followed by six syllables. Therefore, Xin Yuan's "Bamboo groves of Pepper Garden" is not yet perfect. I have changed it to "Leaving the world with emerald ink flowing, beautiful lines filling the land south of the Yangtze River," which is in accordance with the rules of poetry. The corrected version is attached to the left. I ask the connoisseurs of music and elegance in the country to correct the meter. If you grant me a response, I am willing to offer a fan painted with lotus flowers as a reward, creating a literary connection.</p>
<p>A heroic spirit born by the lake, flowers grieving, wine dispelling heroic energy. Viewing the scenery in high autumn, distant wild geese in formation, how many lines can be sent? The North Sea's wine cup is put away, the affairs of Dongshan have passed, but the guest play remains. Where is the mournful zither? Under the plum and peach blossoms, carrying courtesans in vain.</p>
<p>The setting sun shines on the pavilion, singing "Yang Guan," the evening glow boundless. Cattails green, alfalfa emerald, looking at the setting sun, how many flying cavalry. Recruiting hermits west of the city, the painting alone remains, the waterside temple deserted, leaving the world with emerald ink flowing, beautiful lines filling the land south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Sketch of West Lake (National Painting)</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes by the Lakeside</h3>
<p>— Pei Yin</p>
<p>Morning on the Lake</p>
<p>The dark, gloomy tide has just receded, and we come to the lakeside.</p>
<p>Fog envelops the city, shrouds the trees, and presses tightly on the lake surface. We got on the boat, the boat is so small and exquisite, sensitively swaying.</p>
<p>The boat moved, advancing through the fog. Distant mountains and embankments are all obscured by the fog; all that can be seen is the surrounding lake water, a clear and cool lake water. If I did not know that there were mountains and embankments behind this heavy fog, I would definitely suspect that I was in a boundless sea - if the seawater were also so clear and calm, allowing us to drift in a small boat, wouldn't it be even more lovely?</p>
<p>A humid wind blows from the east, we see a yellowish-white light rising from the eastern horizon, so powerfully, shining... I felt the fog dissipating towards the west, and soon I saw a golden sunlight cast on the lake surface hundreds of yards to the east. Our boat is heading east, and the sunlight is moving closer to us. Immediately, we came out of the heavy fog, and the sunlight shone on our boat. Turning around, we saw that there was still some white fog remaining. However, the fog is gradually dissipating, and I saw the wind and sunlight powerfully dispersing them....</p>
<p>In the sunlight, I saw everyone's young smile.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 372</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"I guess, your Uncle Tong is one of those..." Little Tiger released his playful nature; the motive was to dilute Uncle Tong's fiery impulsiveness.</p>
<p>"I say, Little Tiger!..." Tong Zhao tightened his face, narrowed his eyes, searching for mosquitoes like looking for them near an inkstone, and stared at Little Tiger: "You?... You!... You spare this Uncle Tong!..." He felt unable to cope with Little Tiger and had no choice but to beg for mercy.</p>
<p>"Hehe... Don't blame me, I'm just teasing you... The important thing, Uncle Tong, is that you point out a few detective dogs to me, I want to see what those guys look like as thieves..."</p>
<p>"Oh no, my little master," Tong Zhao shook his head even more violently, "You can't provoke them... If they move, everyone moves, we have nothing to do with it, but the common people will suffer!" This was Tong Zhao's experienced opinion.</p>
<p>"You two should stop teasing each other." Yaoqun waved her hand; "We still have a lot of serious things to do, and it's getting late..."</p>
<p>"That's right," Little Tiger took over the conversation again: "Uncle Tong, you know, Aunt Ji and I haven't eaten well for three days and three nights!..." He meant that they hadn't had a good meal for three days and three nights.</p>
<p>"Ai ya," Tong Zhao clapped his hands and looked at Little Tiger, "It's all because of you, ever since I saw the car stop, my soul hasn't returned to my body!... Okay... Let's do this. Big girl, do you think it's okay?..." He indicated that he had a plan.</p>
<p>"What to do?"... After saying that, Yaoqun sat up; she expected Tong Zhao to have a plan.</p>
<p>"I'll first call our trusted old maid to serve you, you two should first have a hygienic cleaning; take a bath, change clothes; then I'll ask the kitchen to prepare four big and four small dishes, to cleanse the dust and welcome you..., after eating, take a rest, at twelve o'clock in the middle of the night, we have a 'special permit' car to send you on your way..., Erdaokou, Qishucha, we have newly added small stations in our old barracks... You, see things and act accordingly, get off the car and change horses, you two will 'enjoy the spring breeze with swift hooves', and you will be sure to arrive at the village early tomorrow morning before daybreak. What do you think?..." Tong Zhao announced his well-thought-out plan.</p>
<p>"No way!" Luoqun shook her head repeatedly; "I think we should do this..." She looked at Tong Zhao, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>"Okay too." Tong Zhao didn't expect Yaoqun to have other plans, and he was stunned for a moment, as if he had some worries: "No mistake, I'll follow your orders, I'll certainly obey!" These words had a hidden meaning of fear that Yaoqun's actions were unpredictable, and he dared not take responsibility; because he knew that Yaoqun and Little Tiger were bold and dared to do anything.</p>
<p>Hu Bin's Ramblings</p>
<h3>Flying for Justice</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>— Dedicated to the New Air Force</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of mankind is to have freedom, peace, and a stable and prosperous life. All "weapons" should exist to ensure "peace."</p>
<p>The "Air Force" is of course no exception. Under its divine wings, the cry it emits should be to fight for justice and pay the price for the happiness and peace of mankind.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, on the "August 14th" Air Force Day, China's new air force flew into the sky over Shanghai in formations and bombed the Japanese "Izumo" warship in turn on the Huangpu River. All the citizens of Shanghai disregarded the danger to their lives and cheered at the sky where battleships, flames, and bullets were flying. This is precisely the call for human justice!</p>
<p>Isn't the image of flesh and blood being split and dripping with blood during the enemy's bombing of the South Railway Station enough to illustrate the brutality of "Sisite"?</p>
<p>During the eight years, isn't the massacre of major cities across the country by enemy planes enough to expose the cruelty and emotions of militarism?</p>
<p>During the bombing of Chongqing and the strafing of enemy planes during the retreat on the Xiang-Gui Road, when life and death were decided in an instant, can you not hate the tyranny of totalitarian countries?</p>
<p>Although the Second World War is over, we are about to face the enemy again and draft a peace treaty. However, there is only one truth. The air force pilots of the whole world, after this war, should be more clear that the air force under the wings of God should fly for justice, fight to combat aggression, and eliminate fascism.</p>

<h3>Mourning Comrade Huang Guangrun</h3>
<p>— Zheng Liren</p>
<p>——In memory of a hero who wore a tunic suit</p>
<p>Guangrun: It has been three whole years since you left this world. In these three long years, I have not forgotten you for a single day, because your death was heroic and great.</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that you often said to me that if your plane was hit by enemy anti-aircraft guns, you would definitely crash down and perish with the enemy. You also said: If your plane was injured in an aerial battle with an enemy plane, you would definitely ram and collide with the enemy plane, even if it meant perishing together. You were so brave and decisive, you were so "seeing death as homecoming."</p>
<p>But my opinion is a little different from yours. I once told you this: If my plane is injured, I must find a way to make a forced landing or, if absolutely necessary, parachute. I will not easily sacrifice my plane and myself, but leave a trace of vitality for the country, and fight and sacrifice for the second or third time. Although our methods are different, our goals are the same. We want to dedicate our lives to our country, we want to fight for the freedom and equality of our motherland.</p>
<p>From the War of Resistance to your sacrifice, we spent seven whole years on the front line. We lived together in Yunnan, inseparable and like brothers, and no one wanted to separate.</p>
<p>After graduation, we broke up. Everyone stepped onto the glorious national revolutionary battlefield and fought more forcefully for the motherland. I was transferred to the Sixth Brigade (Wenjiang), and you were assigned to the Fourth Brigade (Qionglai). From then on, we were separated, and the distance between us was lengthened. However, our hearts are still close together. Half a year later, you were transferred to Wenjiang. Your defense area was Yazi Lin, and my station was near the First General Station. Although we were less than five miles apart, our opportunities to meet were still so rare.</p>
<p>In the early morning of March 14, the 29th year, enemy planes attacked Chengdu in four waves. In that battle, our comrades died or went missing, and I was also unlucky, injured and forced to land on the sandbar in the Jialing River. The enemy also suffered enough. Eight planes were shot down on the spot by us. It was really a fierce battle. However, Guangrun: you were glorious after all, because you shot down one of them.</p>
<p>In the hospital, you saw my diagnosis report, the red and blue lines drawn by the doctors, and you knew my danger. You shed tears many times, and you begged the instructors bitterly to find a special way to save my life.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 30th year in Lanzhou, it should be the most memorable period in your life. There you met a Miss Shen. Pure love is a kind of comfort, encouragement, and help to you.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 33rd year, the War of Resistance entered the most difficult period. The enemy frantically concentrated the most elite main force and made a desperate bet. Our situation in the Central Plains was very unfavorable. Hengyang and Guilin were abandoned one after another, and the enemy approached Guiyang directly, shaking the capital. Your brigade and our brigade received an emergency order to depart separately to attack the enemy's position. You got the good news, forgetting the pain in your body (your toothache had not healed), you must set off. Because I was busy with the attack, I specially asked A Qi to persuade you: "There are many opportunities to attack the enemy! You can set off when your toothache is better." But you didn't listen to her, you resolutely put on your battle robe and happily set off. You led the team, piloting the 40P fighter plane, and flew to Jingmen to attack the enemy's anti-aircraft gun position. Who knew that in this one time, we would be separated from you forever!</p>
<p>Guangrun: You sacrificed gloriously for our motherland! Your death was heroic and great, and you left us many good examples of bravery and decisiveness.</p>
<p>Not long after the victory, I triumphantly returned from the Northwest battlefield, and passed by Jingmen. My A Ying, Yun'er, and Long'er specially brought a bunch of flowers to pay tribute to your loyal soul. From the mouths of the people of Jingmen, I learned that you were abiding by the promise of daily combat, leading three planes to dive into the enemy's position. It was too heroic!</p>
<p>With tears in my eyes, I looked sadly at the sky, Guangrun, you are an immortal hero!</p>
<p>Today, with our deep friendship in the past, I silently pay tribute to you!</p>
<p>36th, August 14th, Air Force Day, at the Taiwan Air Force Command.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>American Restrictions on Gasoline</p>
<p>America's oil fields are mainly in Texas and California, and Houston, Texas, is a famous oil city. Where I live is between Houston and Galveston, surrounded by oil ponds and oil rigs, numbering in the thousands. Because the oil supply is abundant, like a surging tide, to avoid explosions, very high pipes are used to guide the gasoline into the air, burning all day long, like thousands of large candles, like King You lighting beacon fires. These American beacon fires are different after all, and can be considered the largest beacon fires in the world. If we were to calculate the losses, it would be hundreds of thousands of gallons per year, but this kind of loss is unavoidable and very worthwhile because American labor is too expensive. If a large amount of oil is exploited, the price of gasoline will inevitably fall further, falling to one or two cents per gallon, which would not only be unprofitable, but even wages would not be able to be paid. American oil merchants, in order to maintain the price of seven cents per gallon, would rather burn the excess gasoline to protect the minimum profit, just like South American coffee merchants, in order to protect the price of coffee, painfully throw millions of tons of coffee into the ocean. There are many types of gasoline in the United States. There are several gasoline pumps at gas stations, indicating the ingredients and prices. The lowest is seven cents per gallon, and the highest is one dime and two cents. You need a certificate to buy oil to prevent hoarding. However, smart Americans have come up with a way to save gasoline. Every four or five car owners form a group, using gasoline in rotation, consuming an average of one-quarter to one-fifth of the quota, and selling the remaining gasoline to people who cannot get gasoline. The American authorities divide car users into several levels, and allocate different amounts of gasoline according to their duties. Therefore, in addition to office work, if you want to enjoy yourself after work and go out for a drive, you don't have enough gasoline available. They save a little every day, and accumulate for a week before they can travel once. Generally speaking, the gasoline allocated by the government to various users is enough for the needs of official business, but there is absolutely no surplus for entertainment. Even the President of the United States will not be allocated enough gasoline, because the President's gasoline consumption has always been statistically accounted for. He cannot get a few more gallons of gasoline, let alone hoard and speculate. A country as rich as the United States, and produces such a large amount of gasoline, and the people use gasoline so sparingly, looking back at China, where some people use gasoline to wash the floor, what should you think?

<h3>The Author of "I Chose Freedom" Kravchenko</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Pulling down the gray straw hat a bit, covering most of his face, and tightening the thick, black sunglasses, he hurriedly looked around. Seeing nothing, the cautious man came out of the Ministry of Justice, with tall police officers protecting him.</p>
<p>Even so, when he took out his pipe from his pocket, his hand was still trembling. News reporters jumped out, wanting to photograph him, he shrank back and told them not to photograph in Russian mixed with English. When the news reporters' cameras came towards him, he covered his mouth with his right hand.</p>
<p>This person was not acting. He was afraid of death.</p>
<p>His name is Viktor Kravchenko. In the Soviet Union, he committed the crime of treason. When the United States and the Soviet Union were fighting together in 1944, he publicly resigned from his position on the Soviet Purchasing Committee, attacked his government, and revealed all the domestic secrets. When asked why, he answered with only one sentence, which was the title of his best-selling book: "I Chose Freedom." For ten years, he gradually showed his dissatisfaction with communism. When he arrived in the United States, he woke up from a dream and resolutely decided to leave.</p>
<p>Last month, he testified before the US Congressional Committee Investigating Un-American Activities, stating all kinds of Soviet conspiracies. Although he was in extreme danger, even his friends did not know where he lived, and could only get some news from the publishing house that printed his book. However, he still spoke eloquently before the committee. He spoke Russian so fast that even the translator could not keep up. Sometimes he would even add a few awkward English sentences. He said:</p>
<p>"Every responsible Soviet representative in the United States is a political or economic spy."</p>
<p>"No one from the Soviet Union comes without a mission to collect confidential materials."</p>
<p>"There was a metallurgical expert in the Soviet Purchasing Committee named Kimoskin, who collected a lot of secret materials about the American aviation industry. The Soviet Union also collected detailed information about the American submarine industry."</p>
<p>"Don't think that the Soviet Union cannot make atomic bombs. Soviet propaganda says that their scientist Dr. Kabichai has been locked up in a concentration camp. This is a smokescreen."</p>
<p>"If something happens to Stalin, Molotov will come to power. The roles may change, but the play will continue."</p>
<p>"Travelers are more dangerous than communists, because the American government cannot prevent them."</p>
<p>Soviet UN representative Gromyko joked about Kravchenko's affairs:</p>
<p>"If a dog licks its belly when it has nothing to do, maybe many people will gather to watch."</p>
<p>The Soviet ambassador said:</p>
<p>"A traitor is a traitor after all."</p>
<p>Kravchenko was already terrified, but now it was even worse. The next day, he went to the Congressional Judiciary Subcommittee and asked to pass a bill to allow him to become an American citizen.</p>
<p>"I haven't been able to sleep for several nights. I have lost my wife, my father, my brother, and my homeland. I can't hold on anymore. I hope you can understand my situation and help me."</p>
<p>Note: Kravchenko's "I Chose Freedom" has been translated into Chinese by Qin Xuanjun, and published by Shanghai Minzhi Publishing House, and distributed by the Shanghai Branch of Independent Publishing House, and will be published on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Naughty Cat A-Mi</h3>
<p>— Zhang Leping</p>
<h3>In Memory of Zhenzhang</h3>
<p>— Cai Yiwen</p>
<p>—— Fifth in a series of introductions of martyred journalists</p>
<p>Every friend has endless longing and heartfelt memories of Zhenzhang, even though five or six years have passed since his martyrdom! !</p>
<p>Zhenzhang's quiet and demure demeanor is as vivid in my mind as if he were right before me. He never seemed angry; even when extremely frustrated, he would only show it with a flushed face and reddened ears. It is said that silent people are often passionate, and he was indeed such a person. I remember when we were both in Hangzhou, he lived on Pinghai Road, and three or five friends would often gather at his home, sharing meals and living together!</p>
<p>When he came to Shanghai, we worked at the same newspaper, seeing each other almost daily, and our friendship deepened. At that time, I had just gotten married and lived with my family on Haining Road. He would often visit me, and we would often play mahjong for amusement. One New Year's Eve, he personally went to a pawnshop on Shanxi Road and bought a set of mahjong tiles for two yuan, inviting two or three colleagues to play until the first day of the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Morning Post ceased publication, and we parted ways like swallows. I entered the business world, while he was invited by Mr. Mi Jifang of the Xinbao (literally New Report) to be the chief editor of the current affairs section. One year, when the Xinbao published a commemorative issue, he wrote an article titled "Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days," describing his arduous and diligent work at the Xinbao. Unexpectedly, the editor-in-chief, Yao Sufeng, heavily edited the article, changing the title to "One Day" (?). He came to my residence in Hongkou that night, frustrated, and told me about it. I sympathized with him and offered encouragement!</p>
<p>Soon after, Mr. Wang Qixi took charge of the editorial department of the Damei Evening News and invited Zhenzhang to help. At that time, Zhenzhang was feeling depressed and frustrated, so he resolutely accepted the offer and joined the Damei, never expecting that it would lead to his martyrdom!</p>
<p>After the enemy and puppet regime published the "blacklist," Zhenzhang's name was on it. Mr. Qixu secretly went to Hong Kong, while Zhenzhang stayed in Shanghai. The enemy and puppet regime's desire to capture the journalists who remained in Shanghai grew even more urgent. First, there was the murder of Zhu Xinggong and others, followed by daily letters warning him to report to the puppet "Special Operations Headquarters." As a result, Zhenzhang was cautious whenever he went out, but he was still unable to avoid being harmed by the enemy and puppet's henchmen.</p>
<p>On the evening of his assassination, I heard a news vendor shouting on the street, "Damei Evening News headline: Killed!" I hurriedly bought a copy, and the large photograph was indeed of Zhenzhang. Without reading the details, I rushed to Guangci Hospital to inquire about his condition, but the hospital refused to let me see him, saying that his injuries were too severe. I had no choice but to pray for his safety. Unexpectedly, within two days, I heard the news of his death—how sad!</p>
<p>The funeral was held on "September 13th," the day for disbursing Zhenzhang's military allowance, at the International Funeral Parlor. Apart from Bai Luosi and Gao Dexe from the Damei Evening News, who personally attended the funeral, only Brother Gu Junyuan and I, former colleagues from the Morning Post, were there. His mother, who already suffered from poor mental health, suffered multiple fainting spells due to this great shock. Her tragic state was enough to move even the most heartless person.</p>
<p>Two years after his martyrdom, his mother had him buried in Hongqiao Cemetery, next to the grave of another martyred journalist, Zhang Sixu. A certain woman, his former girlfriend, tirelessly managed and arranged everything, seeing the matter through to the end. This was also a repayment for Zhenzhang's sincerity in treating people during his lifetime. There was also Mr. Lu Pingda, who, despite being a stranger, showed admirable sincerity. He took care of all business matters. I would like to especially commend him.</p>
<p>Like the families of other martyred journalists, his family is very poor and struggling to make ends meet. His mother, deeply traumatized, constantly muttered to herself, facing his portrait day and night. A few days ago, I visited her with Brother Zhou Weixin at her three-story attic apartment in Tingyunli on Lafayette Road. We were immediately overcome with tears and inconsolable grief. All we could do was offer comfort.</p>
<p>Now, Weixin and I intend to contact his friends in Hangzhou and his former colleagues to launch a memorial meeting to discuss all outstanding matters, such as the erection of a tombstone, the support of his family, etc. I believe that the members of the "Call" and "Lion's Roar" societies in Hangzhou, as well as the colleagues from the Shanghai Morning Post, Xinbao, and Damei Evening News, will be happy to generously contribute!</p>
<p>Finally, I provide two contact addresses: (1) Zhou [blank] at the Social Affairs Bureau; (2) Cai Yiwen, Shenbao (literally Shanghai Report).</p>
