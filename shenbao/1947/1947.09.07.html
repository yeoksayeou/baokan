<h3>大局已入綏靖時期　東北叛亂不難敉平　蘇聯接濟共匪已成鐵一般的事實　白崇福熊式輝發表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國防部長白崇禧六日接見此間某晚報記者，就蘇聯接濟中共事實及當前戰局情勢發表談話稱：蘇聯明目張胆，接濟東北共軍，已成鐵一般事實，蘇軍未開入前，東北絕無共軍蹤跡，而目前東北已成共匪大本營，蘇軍固未實際參戰，然蘇軍將其接收所得槍械數十萬枝移交共軍，否則長春以北及東北其他地區共匪何來如許槍械，事實俱在，何用否認。白氏對肅淸共匪頗具信心，相信剿匪戡亂必獲成功，惟仍盼人民堅强信心，對當前戰局亦有明確看法，指出大局已入綏靖時期，鄂皖近頗吃緊，惟僅由殘匪流竄，不致發生多大作用。東北匪軍誠將發動其六次攻勢，然重要據點國軍咸有重兵保衛，陳總長又坐鎭東北，親自督師，共匪企圖不難粉碎。至兩廣局勢，白氏認李濟琛輩作亂，無槍無彈，何能組軍，外傳有三萬人之說，絕不足信，相信決不致發生作用。白氏對外交政策亦有陳述，特別强調自力更生必要，惟信美國援華亦爲勢所必然之事。</p>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕熊式輝卸任抵平後，六日晨在私邸破例公開接見記者，縷述二年來接收東北經過稱：中蘇友好條約簽字後，政府擬採外交方式接收東北，本人前年十月遂到長春，其後以中蘇條約不爲蘇方所尊重，未能實行，外交方式接收之希望，遂吿終止。在此時期中共曾乘機擴充實力，其後政府改用政治方式接收，曾由三人小親進行調處，卒以中共不遵重停戰協定，大肆擴充武力，覇佔地盤，政治途徑之門遂又關閉。今年國府頒布動員戡亂令，進行用軍事方式接收，東北民衆聞聽之下，極爲興奮，紛紛擁護動員，帮助軍隊，軍民合作極佳。渠次述其主持東北二年來之感想稱：東北原無共黨，因物產豐富，可謂家給人足，故先天的即不歡迎共黨，加以近兩年來共黨破壞工鑛，離散人民，後天的益爲人民厭惡，中共如何宣傳，亦歸無效。記者以外傳氏之新職相詢，熊謂皆不可信，本人亟願休息。某記者稱：動員令下後，豈許主任休息，熊笑謂：「換班」。嗣熊氏答記者問稱：（一）陳總長蒞瀋後，因直接指揮關係，軍政已統一，外傳陳氏前次蒞瀋曾槍斃軍官十餘名及文官若干名不確，僅不久以前本人曾槍斃營口稽査處長寗苞一名。（二）所謂共軍六次攻勢，係宣傳，目前尙未見諾行動，東北共匪估計約五十餘萬，刻其主力在瀋海，吉海綫，一部主力在通遼，共匪第五次攻勢最猛，損失亦最重大，再度來犯，亦將遭受同樣命運。（三）共匪中確有韓共，瀋陽即有此項俘虜，吾人曾自韓共中發現八卦斧頭鐮刀旗，且繳獲有俄式機槍。（四）抗戰期中，中央設計局對東北各項計劃，如省區劃分等，大致不差，惟今日經濟交通之破璣，則出人意外耳，吾人仍主東北建設重工業，因東北乃中國心臟命脈所在也。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽六日電〕熊式輝於離瀋前將其所藏宋明版書數百册，贈予瀋陽國立圖書館。</p>
<h3>陳誠招待民意代表　談刷新政治途徑　杜絕貪污簡化行政機構</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽六日電〕陳誠六日下午四時招待遼潘民意機構代表茶曾，表示刷新政治應遵循之途徑，（一）杜絕貪汚，積極實行民生主義，使貪汚自然絕跡，消極地向貪汚者開刀。（二）願化行政機構，裁併駢枝機關辦法，已呈政院核示，各省行政機構將加强其戰鬥性能。陳氏並稱：接受各方面之意見，東北絕對不能特殊化，以東北之各種優越條件，實爲實行三民主義之最好試騐區，願與東北人民共同努力建設三民主義之新東北。東北隔離祖國十四年，各項人材至感短乏、盼盡一切努力，完成百年樹人大計，爲新東北播種優良之種子。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽六日電〕東北民意團體六日向陳兼主任提出簡化東北機關，整飭軍風紀，保障地方人民福利，復興東北工商業等四項建議及報吿東北一般情况，陳氏特以座談會方式接受各項建議。並於席上對東北軍事。政治。經濟作全貌解剖，闡明如何決心建設之演說，博得熱烈擁護與歡迎。關於簡化機關問題，已決定先簡化東北接收機構，聞先將東北敵僞資產統一事業接收委會，東北生產管理局，東北房地產管理局合併組織爲東北敵僞事業處理局，王家楨出任局長。</p>
<h3>東北行轅人事更動</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽六日電〕行轅高級人事發表者，除國防部總參議楚溪春兼行轅辦公室副主任外，嫰江省主席彭濟羣任秘書長。又瀋警備部司令彭壁生調駐台灣二〇五師長，遺缺由李明灝繼任。</p>
<h3>陳明仁奉召南下</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平六日電〕四平守將陳明仁將軍，奉主席電召，今日下午六時由瀋飛抵平，明搭中航機轉京。</p>
<h3>杜聿明尙須養病再負軍責說不確</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據接近杜聿明將軍之人士談稱：杜氏健康近已有進步，惟據醫師之判斷，尙須有兩個月之調治，方能脫離醫藥階段。以後之休養時間，愈長愈好。故外傳杜氏將重負軍事責任之說，純屬機測之辭，不足置信。杜氏爲軍人故對政府之命令，自當服從，惟一切仍取決於健康情形，又日來杜氏甚少接見賓客，僅與友好嚴莊等數人晤談。</p>
<h3>主席遊大天池</h3>
<p>與王陵基等共野餐</p>
<p>〔中央社牯嶺六日電〕蔣主席夫婦今曾遊覽大天池，並在該處野餐，王陵基，森濟時等被邀參加，下午三時半始返。四時此間大雨，薄暮稍停，一塲秋雨，倍覺清涼。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺六日電〕蔣夫人六日下午五時召見前第五軍九十六師副師長胡義賓夫人龍志勤，對胡於卅一年春於緬甸之役殉職後遺族生活問題，甚表關切，並允派飛機赴麥通，將胡遺體運贛安葬。</p>
<h3>各部隊官兵薪餉已按新標準發給</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕軍人待遇業經政院決定自八月份起調整，記者爲明瞭各部隊經費領發情形，特往訪聯勤總部負責人，據談，本部撥發軍費俱提前一月匯發，從無積壓官兵薪餉。公雜各費（即經常費），至遲於上月廿日以前，亂食馬乾各費，至遲於上月十五以前全部匯交各補給區轉發，對於有軍事行動之區域，更儘可能提前匯發。此次八月份調整給予命令，係於八月廿一日頭行，因調整給與應增加之經費，八九兩月份本部已按國防部規定之標凖於八月廿八日全部匯出，至副食馬乾價款，受物價上漲之影響，原定標準不敷，正簽請自九月份起增加中。九月份戀需價款，早於八月八日匯出，十月份亦於九月二日匯出，各部隊即可分向各該地區補給機關洽領。</p>
<h3>最近物價波動原因</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕接近政府人士談：各地物價近又略見波動，主要原因係季節關係，蓋每入秋季物價即略上揚，政府已注意及此，正自緊縮信用，加强管制等方面籌謀有效對策，除季節關係外，物價上漲原因的有下列數種：（一）英鎊貶値，且不能套取美元，香港游資紛紛北移。（二）漢口等地游資，因戰事開始集中上海，國人對魏德邁來華所有希望過大，當時物價曾一度下落，此爲「非常」現象，旋又恢復正常，而此種因素或爲一時現象，或爲一地現象，物價不久即不難重趨平穩。</p>

<h3>司使在平發表演說　美對華立場　援華目的在使人民獲利</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平六日電〕司徒大使六日下午四時，在燕大北平同學會歡迎席上，發表廿分鐘講演，對美國援華政策與立塲，解釋甚詳。大使稱，美國重要國際政策爲保持世界和平，以免因主義利益不同，再掀起三次大戰，即使任何國家不受外來武力或政治的侵略。至美對華政策，始終未變，援華政策亦未變，然援華在使全國人民都獲得好處，即援助人民所擁戴之政府。此政府必須有愛國不貪汚而有地位與成績，能使國外人有好印象之官吏。大使並稱，中美多年傳統邦交，如建立在實際利益上，自當更爲鞏固，對於美國所求之世界和平亦關係極大。</p>
<h3>滬各工會領袖電美請認識我時局癥結　中共叛國實為禍亂之根源</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕上海勞工界各領袖，爲使美國朝野對於我國局勢增進認識起見，特由總工會及各著名工會理事長水祥雲，周學湘等聯名，致電杜魯門總統曁各當局，有所陳述，茲錄電文如下：</p>
<p>華盛頓杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務卿曁國會諸先生閣下，吾人以上海各工會負責人之立塲，鑒於貴國對敝國局勢之深表關切，謹請陳述吾人之意見如左：</p>
<p>敝國國民人人皆知，今日敵國種種危離不幸之根源，乃爲中共問題，若無中共之叛亂，則敵國於對日戰爭之瘡痍早可大部平復，而今日吾人所忍受之種種困難與痛苦，亦皆可避免。</p>
<p>吾人希望貴國人民切勿爲中共之民主口號所欺，彼等認爲，任何反共之主張即爲封建與反民主者，但在中共佔領之地區中，則絕無眞正之自由可言，反之，彼等所用者，乃爲殘忍之獨裁手段，試觀眞正之工會能在中共統治之地區中立足乎？其答案則斷然爲「否」。</p>
<p>吾人可舉匈牙利爲例，其少數之共產份子，使用其强　之力量，已奪得政權矣。</p>
<p>貴國正力阻世界共產侵略主義之蔓延，並聞貴國政府中亦正進行淸除共產黨員及其同情者之工作，吾人希望貴國勿以為敝國人民與他國人民逈異，更勿以爲中國共產黨乃與世界其他各地之共產黨完全不同。上海市總工會理事長水祥雲，華成烟廠產茶工會理事長周學湘，美商電話公司工會理事長梁永章，上海郵務工會理事長王震百，上海輪船木業工會理事長葉翔臯，英商自來水工會理事長周福江，上海煤氣工會理事長章子衡，華商水電公司工會理事長周雲江，永安紗廠工會理事長林去庭，申新紗廠工會理事長翁善和，中紡公司紡織廠工會理事長張睿華，統一紗廠工會理事長湯桂芬，鴻章紗廠工會理事長張文龍，崇新紡織廠工會理事長張師齡，上海市染織業工會理事長傳友康，中紡公司毛紡廠工會理事長唐尙義，上海市針織業產業工會理事長凌英貞，頤中烟廠工會理事長洪梅全，南洋烟廠工會理事長唐根寳，上海市印刷業工會理事長胡堃，美孚油廠工會理事長宋志明，德士古油廠工會理事長陶植之，亞細亞油廠工會理事長舒家政，上海市碼頭工會理事長莩慶義，上海市旅館業工會封雅漢。</p>
<h3>王外長離滬飛美　四全會將檢討外交政策　各方盼政府採強硬外交</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕我出席聯合國第二次大會首席代表王外長世杰偕隨員胡慶育，張沅長等一行，於六日晨七時搭泛美公司客機離滬飛美，赴機塲歡送者，有外部駐滬辦事處主任陳國廉，新聞局駐滬辦事處處長魏景蒙等十餘人。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京六日電〕王世杰外長之外交政策，去年曾在三中全會遭受抨擊，今年在四中全會又將攻擊其對美「叩首」，對蘇懦弱。四中全會定九日開會，現有一種運動似欲在國民黨要員間集合力量，要求澈底檢討中國之「磕頭」外交政策。聯合社記者綜合各方意見，發現國民黨要人間對於王外長本人感情益為激昂。其中數人稱，王氏盲目依賴美國及畏懼蘇聯之見解，使中國在世界强糊政治中成爲犧牲品，國民黨某要人稱，偶然在外交中表演力量，常有收穫，美國曾兩次採納中國之意見，如盟國管制日本委員會中國代表團前任團畏朱世明，對日本船隻噸位之分配，與美國意見分歧，堅持立塲卒吿成立，是其一例。關於中蘇對東北問題之談判，王氏慣於向世界掩藏談判僵持之眞正原因，此點特別引起此輩國民黨員之不滿。某官員稱：「蘇聯倘不欲以大連與旅順歸還中國，可令全世界知之」。</p>
<h3>企業團體選舉選總說明三點</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕關於企業團體選舉權之行使問題，選總頃解釋數點如次：（一）本屆選舉，係直接選舉，職業團體亦係田基層會員投票，非由團體參加競選，商業團體方面，不問其會員屬於地方商會抑全國商聯會，俱由各公司行號或工廠依法所派之會員代表直接行使選舉權。至對兩種選舉如何參加，於名額詳細分配辦法內頒定之。（二）自由職業團體國代及立委之產生，亦俟詳細分配案內頒定。（三）選舉法規中所謂全國性職業團體之選舉、係指不能逐業按省市分配名額必須劃區分選或全國合選之職業團體而言，與團體有無全國性之組織無關。</p>
<h3>陳立夫競選立委請浙省黨部提名</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州六日電〕現任中央政治委員會秘書長陳立夫，原籍浙江吳興，決定參加浙省第一區立委競選，依照國民黨員參加競選實施辦法之規定，昨已向浙省黨部申請提名爲本黨候選人。</p>
<h3>台省有力人士尙缺競選熱誠</h3>
<p>〔本報台北二日電〕據台省選舉事務所主事人吿記者，台　具有較其他各省最優勢的選舉基礎，各縣市區鄉均能於限定時期內完成二百九十餘萬選民之登記。本另即開始參加競選人之登記。渠確信台胞定可能順利完成選舉步驟，估計選民以一部地處鄕村僻野不能投票及婦女外，至少有三分之一不致放棄其選舉權。惟渠特別强調且前須作有力量之　傳，使對政治失去興趣之公正有力人士，軍行恢復其競選熱誠。日來報章固迭見競選廣告，若干更於半年前即以遊說方式到處演講，但其熱憶顯已减低，實引爲隱憂。另據參加立委競選代表之一吿記者，彼絕不願見以金錢活動之選舉方式出現於合省。僅　所在國所得稅</p>
<h3>國人在國外所得</h3>
<p>僅　所在國所得稅</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國人在國內有住所，其在國外之所得及營利事業本店或主事務所在國內，其在國外之分支店營業所營利之所得，依現行所得稅法第一條及其施行細則第四條之規定，均應踝征所得稅，惟此項所得，或已依照其所在國所得稅法之規定分別課稅，財部爲避免重複課稅計，茲規定此項在國外之所得，依其所在國稅法已納之所得稅，經提示確實證據者，准在應納之各該項所得稅總額中，分別扣除或申請退我，、以示公允。</p>
<h3>國大代表立法委員選舉程序補充釋明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕國大代表及立委各級選舉事務所，依法經辦選舉關於程序問題之補充驟明，月前由選舉總事務所擬就，呈國府核示，茲由國府正式明令公布，全文如次：</p>
<p>國民大會代表立法院立法委員，各級選舉事務所依法經辦選舉關於程序問題之補充釋明。</p>
<p>甲　關於國民大會代表選舉程序者</p>
<p>（一）國民大會代表選舉罷免法第卅條所稱內地生活習慣特殊之國民，指全國各地之回民，選舉屬於全國性。</p>
<p>前項國民之選舉人名册，應由各縣市及其同等區域以及直轄市選舉事務所分別造具公吿後，以其總數逕報選舉總事務所備</p>

<p>（三）選舉總事務所　集所報候選人名册，於法定期間，轉飭各縣市及其同等區域以及直轄市選舉事務所公吿。</p>
<p>（四）內地生活習慣特殊之國民，於法定選舉日期，憑選舉權證領取選舉票，遵照選舉通吿之規定投票。</p>

<h3>日貨質劣價昂　外商表示不滿　劉菊生出任我赴日商務專員</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京六日電〕第一批來日之外國商業代表，已在日本勾留廿一日，對日本貨品之質劣價昂，頗表失望。來日商人頃已訂立合同二百件左右，然購買者大部均對日貨價格之高，表示不滿。彼等認爲日本之若干出口貨品價格，高於目前之世界市塲價格，因之無法大量購買。又日本製造廠家和如不極力改進其成品，則「日本製造」字樣，仍將為劣質物品之標幟。來日商人對出口日貨數量之少，亦有所不滿。據稱，彼等自美來日前，曾接到可購買之日貨貨品單，惟其上未標明數量之多少，及至抵日之後方發現若干貨品數量極少。第一批來日商人與日本廠家旣訂有大量合同，則表明日本貿易之恢復，縱有若干商人不滿，但尙未完全失敗。來日第一批商人約有半數申請延長留日期限，預料第二批最近期內尙不能來日。據中國代表團方面稱，代表團尙未接到將行來日中國商人之名單。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕報載官方對設置赴日商務專員事，曾予否認。記者以此詢經濟部發言人，承談，此次開放對日貿易，規定嚴格，遠非自由貿易可也，因之設置商務專員殊有必要，人選已決定，由我駐日代表團委員劉菊生出任，並由崔萬秋副之。記者詢以公營事業及民間工商界推派代表情形，據談公營事業推派代表辦法，可能有所修改，工商界代表迄未推出，代表團何日成行，現難確定。</p>
<h3>萬燦談草擬和約立場　慎防日捲土重來　勿再蹈凡爾賽和約覆轍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕監察委員兼外部對日和約審議委會審議委員萬燦，六日接見記者，談草擬對日和約應予力爭各點稱：前事不忘，後事之師，我人回溯凡爾賽和約未能遏阻德國東山再起之故事、並記取其敎訓，對草擬對日和約當有所裨益。凡爾賽和約最大缺點有五：（一）摧毀德國武裝不够澈底，（二）解除德經濟武裝不够積極，（三）賠款之後繼以貸款，最後又任德國全部賴光，（四）對　土問題時，僅處理其國外領土，對其本士未加處置，（五）再敎育工作未盡做到，基於上述五點，我人鄭重提出如下之主張、此種意見爲每一中國人民所堅持者，亦爲防止日本捲土重來爲害世界必須做倒者。</p>
<p>最先‘亦爲最重要者，即日本之武裝應澈底的完全的予以解除，甚至經訓練後即可成爲部隊之警察，亦　嚴加限制，佔領日本工作，應繼續若千時期，至眞正的民主日本出現後始予撤退。</p>
<p>就經濟而言，日本損失遠較中國爲輕，其工業幾全部完整，隨時有崛起爲害可能。遠東委會基本政策所規定之「非戰爭性之經濟可予維持」一點，所謂「非戰爭性」，其範圍與含義應嚴加限制，凡外表爲平時性，面實際具有戰爭意義者，統應在限制之列。又麥帥所提日工業應恢復一九三〇—三四年水準之說，亦應修正，蓋九一八前後，正爲日本工業最有基礎之時。</p>
<p>關於賠款，我人至少須堅持鮑萊所提中國應得百之四十之建議，我人除應獲得戰爭損失之賠償外，並應獲得重建工業之賠償，因之，賠償物資，應以生產機器爲主。</p>
<p>領土問題，蘇在遠東作戰前後僅歷一週，不特盡復失土，甚至進入若干新地區，我失地如琉球等，應盡力謀求規復。</p>
<p>最後，就再敎育而言，此點非澈底達成不可，日本在麥帥統治下，表面已無侵略意圖，然民政黨，政友會等渣　仍存在，秘密團體正從事地下工作，三井。三亦仍暗底活動，尾崎不久前並發表其東北台灣應投票自決之謬論，凡此皆證明，日本距民主尙遠，而其侵略野心迄未弭滅，再敎青工作實有積極澈底進行必要，審訊戰犯遲遲未決，近復有若干戰犯無故獲釋，皆不足取。</p>
<p>萬氏結諭稱：上述諸點卑之無甚高論，然實爲我中國人民經長時期痛苦敎訓後所一致提出之呼籲，草擬和約時，應絕對予以堅持。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕據悉：美國已決定不顧蘇　堅決之反對。實行平日與其他太平洋有關各國討論對日和約之計劃。若干國務院高級官員認爲，唯一之辦法，乃先與太平洋十國會談，決定和會之。期及地點後，再邀請蘇聯參加。</p>
<p>〔合衆社　香山六日電）澳外長伊瓦特在赴紐約途中過此談，對日初步和會，應在九月十六日聯合國大會前舉行。</p>

<h3>國字改進的途徑</h3>
<p>— 黃若舟</p>
<p>文字是表達語言的符號，用作開通知識，普及敎育發展文化的工具。所以一國文字，對於人民的生活和知識程度，影響甚大。我國文字係直接由我民族古代圖畫文字演進而成，具有悠久的歷史，純粹的傳統。從秦朝推行同文的政策以來，奠定全國統一的局面。數千年來，這地大人衆的國族，其間雖不盡能讀能寫，而率受了文字直接間接之陶冶，外至日本，高麗，安南諸族亦皆號曰同文，雖以積弱，屢遭異族侵入淪亡，然終爲我國所同化，足見文化傳統所具有的支配潛力，超過任何有形的政治權力。國字對於統一中華民族的育成統一和發展，貢默最大，且具有特殊性格，遠非其他門類的文化所可比擬。政治權力必須以文化潛力作他底根本基礎，今後建國途程中，必須積極從寧我國文化的重建。</p>
<p>我國文字是由結繩繪像畫卦，而甲骨古　大小篆隸八分到現在的正楷行草。從字體變遷方面看，就很明白的顯露出來，遠從造字之初，近至現代，按廣義的方面來說，無時無地不在改進之中，不過在這改進的程序中，有遲有速以及方法的不同而已。此次抗建爲我國歷史上之偉舉，其爲一劉時代之鉅變，要毋庸疑。明夫古今文字之變遷，觀古而論其時，庶不致混淆不淸。若今後之變，固杳杳無涯，未敢以耳目之私測之，但根據人生進化的原理和過去的事實，證明了這個繁難的國字，應用於近代社會上，已有了問題。所以，近年國內許多敎育家文學家紛紛倡導改進國字運動，有的主張採用革命式的；有的主張採用演變式的，各有所見，自未易作一合理之判斷。今聯合國文化敎育科學組織，正在南京召開第一次基本敎育會議。敎育部爲集思廣益計，會召集國內專家舉行預備會議，關於基敎首要的語文敎學中的國字改革間題，爭論得非常熱烈。有主張漢字之不可改者，有建議漢字必須改進者，更有主張廢除漢字而以拉丁化或羅馬化字代替者。在此倡言改革，聚訟紛紜的時候，可能差之毫厘，失之千里。蓋建國必先建敎，而基本敎育，影響尤大。胡適曾經說過：「對於中國文字改進問題，是贊成由漸而改，不贊成在最短期間，就把漢字拋開，譬如完全採用國語羅馬字，須把漢字的邏輯，完全印人國語羅馬字之後，方可漸漸脫下舊袍換上新衣，所謂改進勝於革命是也。」本來就演變而論，應該出之於自然，文字改進，當隨社會文化漸漸蛻化，並非突然發生，亦非突然消滅。今把西洋文字改選史來作例證，土耳其是採取積極方法，於最短期內，實行新字，廢棄舊字。法國是採取消極辦法，每年廢除若干萬字，加入若干新字。不過依我國的國情而論，尤其是民族意識尙不堅定，社會秩序動盪不安的現在，更不宜仿效土耳其的辦法。凡一個民族旣有了根深蒂固的文化，要想革故鼎新，另起爐灶，是不可能的事。就是最富於革命性的蘇聯，他的文字的現代化，至今還保存着他同有的斯拉夫字母，只稍許加以整理而已，並沒有採用歐美所謂有國際性的羅馬字，同時亦沒有這種必要。</p>
<p>我國文字，一字數音，多字同音，一字數義，多字同義，一字數形，筆劃繁多，各有其歷史傳統因襲的特殊用法，不僅學者不易辦認，敎學也不易傳其精微。這是國字敎學的根本困難，以致敎育不易普及，民智難開。際此國家社會定向科學化現代化的時期，國字首先要加以一番整理改進的工作，才能作爲掃除文盲的工具，達成普及敎育的任務。所以，我們雖然鑒於國字與我民族關係的密切，不宜廢掉，却希望國字應該趕速整理和改進。至於改進的方式，則是最値得硏討的。否則任憑改進運動鬧得震天價　，社會上還是置之不理，不能興起什麽作用。因此，國字的改革，應該從國字本身的性質和改進限度以及社會的可能接受程度等各方面研究，探討其途徑。如提倡注音符號是字音的改進，改用語體文是字義的改進，這些都是專家學者尋求改進國字的方案。關於改進的限度亦曾一再更改，以謀切合需要。十幾年來，已經有了顯著的成效，可是還需要積極的推動，以求普遍發展，達到理想的目標。文字不外形，音，義三方面，國字已經解決了音義兩點的困難，在現階段僅僅留下一點字的形體問題，不過這一點比以上兩點更是重要。因爲方塊字筆畫繁多，需寫實在不易，大家嫌書寫繁難，便想把國字徹庭的廢掉，所以這一點不加改進，就要影響到整個國字問題。國字形體到了今天，可說雜亂無章，一個通常的正字之外，尙有許多不倫不類的變形字。這類字體的造成，當然爲了字形繁難，應用急促。所以學校裏敎學的雖是統一的楷書，而學生應用的却是這一類楷書以外的字體，因之造成用非所學，學非所用的現象。這類字體當然隨年級而增多，到了大學畢業，應用的書法，和日文的片假名相仿。記得民卅二年本人應貴陽師範學院邀講國字書寫問題時，謝六逸在介紹辭中曾說：「同學們平素抄寫的字，我不能完全認識，有許多還要靠很長時間想像得來。」所以現在學生不習所敎的字，敎師不識學生所寫的字。可能今日不識昨天的字，明日寫的不是今天的字，谷人寫各人的字，各地有各地的字，弄得字亦有個別性，有地方性。我國方言龐雜，全賴文字來溝通，將來如果沒有統一的文字，不知將如之何？茍再因循相沿，將不知伊於胡底，現今一班靑年學生只圖應用方便，何嘗知逍破壞文字的惡果。這當然是個敎育問題，不能疏忽微細的地方和原始的時候，應該趕速設法挽救這個危機。否則，影響到國族的統治和文化的進展，問題就更大了！國字筆畫繁多，應用書寫，確感困難，自當力求簡化，適應時代需要。戰前敎育部曾頒一種常用的簡字，不知如何立即收回成命，十數年來，所有社會上應用的書法，變本加厲，愈趨愈簡，繁雜紛歧，幾至不可收拾境地。因此，國內學渚紛紛視倡簡字，參政會亦曾有此建議。文字書寫一道。爲傳播文化之利器，民族精神之外型，決不容再讓他混亂下去。負責敎育文化當局，應該依照文字滋乳繁衍的途徑，逐漸演變轉化，順乎語言紀錄的需求，制定一種通用簡便的字體，由於社會的潛移默化，字形逐漸單純劃一，那原有的繁難字和流行的變形字，自然能消滅於無形。</p>
<p>字形雜亂的造成，書寫困難，是唯一的主因。所以書寫問題不解決，就是將來字形整理得完善了，免不了還要繼續不斷的紛擾下去。因爲方形方筆楷書，實在不宜乎書寫。世界上任何一個民族的文字，都有印刷體，書寫體二種，印刷體是方正的，便於鐫刻；書寫體是圓轉的，宜於繕寫。即習用漢字之日文，亦有些一種字體。我國文字印刷書寫兩種，同是楷法，自漢以來，沿用未變，然而蛭了人事紛繁，文化進展的現代，已經感到楷書笨拙，多以行行草書寫，不能作行草的則代以簡體字變形字，較諸楷書效能增加幾倍。秦漢時創制行草，原爲利於書寫，適應當時需要，歷代應用，從未間斷，不過在科舉時代世俗猶多崇尙正楷。民國以來，行草方始盛行，現今已經發展到小學生能認識行草，中學生多書寫行草的階段，這是社會環境所造成，亦是自然的趨向。起初並非有賴於人力的鼓勵或宣傳而到如此地步，其所以通國流行，無遠弗屆者，純爲風氣所造成，和制度文章學術等皆須受時代之影響。同一理由，目前社會上應用的書法，可說以行草爲主，除非是法律規定和尊敬積習的限制，必須正楷書寫。不過自從中文打字機出世之後，楷書的作用亦更少了。最近林語堂等改造新式輕便的打字機，應用更趨簡捷，節省時間人力，不失爲廣播文化之一助。將來正楷書寫的難題，就此可以解決了。今後學校習字，當可减少楷書習練、袛須和英文一樣的多習寫草體，就足够應用了。部頒課程標準早已規定書法先求切近實用而以敏捷正確爲原則，楷書以外亦須習寫行草。近年國人倡導以行草書寫的，頗不乏人，有的主張應用行書，有的主張應用草書，更有主張改用圓體字，不過因爲不適合或是超過社會的需要和環境的可能，多未見行世。行書比正楷稍流利些，草書比行書更流利而簡單，以之實用，行書尙嫌繁難，不够需求。草書過於簡單，差異並不明顯，認識非常困難，不能爲求書寫便利而增加認識困難。所以適應需求，必須首先研究兒童和民衆學習的心理，更需要從事充分時間的蜜騐，應該選取通用易識的草書，以及簡便易寫的行書，合行草二者之長而成爲一種行草體，再加以科學方法整理，可以分析，可以拚合，旣有標準而有系統，成爲一種易寫易識易學，簡便正確敏捷的實用通行的書法。行草可以一二圓轉鈎連的筆畫，替代二三十畫的方直筆致，比較任何字體簡便得多，省時省事，其經濟無以復加，並且正楷與行草字形，並無多大變異，所謂草有眞意也。這點要比其他文字印刷體與書寫體的形體互異，勝過一籌。</p>
<p>行草通行之後，便成爲一種國字書寫體，其時我們認識的是正楷，書寫的是行草，與其他各國文字印刷體書寫體之分行，並駕齊驅。書寫問題旣經解決，字形亦無謂繁難了。國字在目前被認爲繁難的癓結，並不在認識和解釋兩點，而是形體書寫的尙不簡易，今行草旣可解決書寫的艱難和形體的繁雜，所以提倡行草書法，未始不是改進個字的光明途徑。國字的形音義三方面都已有了改進的方法，國字便成爲容易學習之文字，但是還須端賴敎育工作者的積極推行，敎學方法爲學習之最要關鍵，得其法者學習必易，不得其法者，其學也難，中國人不識字者多，並非由於文字之艱難，而實由於文字之敎學未得其法耳。</p>

<h3>就美國提前援歐問題　范登堡發表意見　力主先行調查歐洲實況</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕參院外交委員會主席范登堡今夜就美國提前援歐之議發表意見，表示國會不能在黑暗中行動，亦不擬簽發任何空頭支票。國會特別會議之召開，應由總統爲之，而總統亦必須提出事實，以證明有召開特別會之必要。</p>
<p>范氏並暫定十月十五日爲參院外委會開始討論援歐計劃之最早日期，蓋外委會委員不乏尙在國外者，最早須至彼時始能趕回。范登堡此項表示，已堪證明參衆兩院之共和黨多數議員，當不致接受副國務卿洛維特建議提前召集國會會議，以討論臨時緊急援歐計劃之議。范登堡並堅持須由政府於國會得以採取任何行動前，先行提供歐洲危機之事實及由美國應付此等危機之建議辦法。在范氐發表此項意見之先，已有其他若干議員，指責國務院虛構歐洲之危機，以遂其政治目的。觀察家咸認在任何對歐臨時緊急援助實施以前，尙須由國務院爲國會之行動，從事更多之準備工作。</p>

<h3>牯嶺秋色　主席官邸　藝術氣雰濃郁　山上馬路修築計劃擱淺</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺四日航訊〕河東路頭之元首肖像，現又經傅廷彥重加繪製，其尺度與容貌如舊，惟元首丰彩，却更安祥莊嚴，行人覩之，不勝高山仰止之感。茲聞傳氏最近又繪製元苜肖像中型油畫一幅，以作元首今夏蒞山紀念。（按：傳氏以去夏在山繪元首夫婦及馬帥肖像名噪一時）。</p>
<p>藝術家傅廷彥，最近在山上的傑作，尙有白應洞之朋來亭，秀峯寺之馬尾泉，海會寺，觀音橋，五老峯，靑玉峽，秀峯寺門，歸宗寺山門，這幾幅小型水彩畫，昨（三日）由贛主席王陵　加裝鏡框，敬獻元首，將爲元有官邸的裝飾品之一。</p>
<p>勵志社總社第三處處長袁留莘，爲國內名畫家之一最近在山上，繪興頗濃，曾親赴含鄱口等寫生，現已製成中型油畫數幅。元首夫婦蒞山後，蘆山秋色大爲增輝。但是，刧後朮光的街市，又揭起了物價的漲風，在週前的米價，每石十七萬元，現在躍達到廿五萬大關，較諸南昌爬上五萬，飯菜館客飯，每客又漲三千，－計一萬一千元。</p>
<p>今年各地苦熱，消暑勝地的廬山，亦不能例外。前幾天頂熱的時候，室內溫度，昇至八十四度，一直到今天中午，尙滯留在七十五左右。據一位「老廬山」說：今年是近七十年來最熟的一年，就在這個熱浪侵擾的季節裏，蘆山深感水源的乾涸，除了裝有自來水管的幾條街道與住宅區外，山人多須自遠地汲取，就是河東路元首官邸的水源，亦吿不濟，每日須用機器抽水，忙煞機器匠與大司務。</p>
<p>大火後的牯嶺市區，因管理局的努力經營，走上復興之路，但是「物力唯艱」的今日，廬山一切建設，受此一因素而阻碍進度。市區新街口的火塲慘象，依然存在，熱鬧市區的大街，除了有少數的幾家舖面，建築規模，比較可觀外，利用着頹垣敗壁搭蓋的臨時店房，依然是比麟接棟，但是，馬路的寬度，確是放寬，使一般來到牯倣的人們，頓時獲一印象：這裏是奠下了建設新牯嶺的基石。</p>
<p>牯嶺的電氣設備，確較去年完善，如普遍而雪亮的電燈，明晰方便的電話，傳遞迅速的電報，眞够得稱上爲新都市的設備了。由山上登出的普通商電，祇要一小時即可到達對方收報人，其敏快程度由此可見一斑。</p>
<p>這次元首蒞山後，會表示廬山乃遊覽之區，不宜有汽車行駛與「哇哇」的喇叭聲「山上馬路」的修築，恐將擱淺，關於」山上馬路」管理局及省公路處，正在重作考慮中。</p>

<h3>新殺子報　蘭谿晚娘下毒手鄭福坤從旁助虐　硬叫四齡兒子吞鱔致死</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭谿三日訊〕近日本縣茶樓酒肆均在談論一件義人聽聞的新聞：本縣單南鄕新橋地方。死者名　繼生，男性，現年僅四歲。繼生之父名鄭福坤，現年四十二歲，娶有四妻。長妻無子，退回婆家。二妻生二子，最長者已十歲。旋二妻病故，再娶范氏，生子繼生，不久因夫妻感情破裂，經蘭谿地方法院判決離婚，繼生歸母范氏敎養由鄭福坤年給榖五百斤，於每年二月及八月兩期給付，作爲繼生之敎養費，每年給繼生衣服一套。立有字據。後鄭福坤不守信約，而范氏又改嫁三峯鄕八角井某姓家，當將繼生送回鄭福坤家。卅三年十一月間鄭福坤又娶唐氏第四房續絃，唐氏係本縣諸葛鄕唐村人，生有一子，惟鄭唐氏聽信算命瞎子之言，「你家裏必定要死一個人，不然你的兒子不會長命的」。於是鄭唐氏乃畜意謀害繼生，百般敲打，施盡晚娘手段。本年陰歷六月十六日晚間，鄭唐氏竟下毒手，縛住繼生雙手，用大鱔魚一條，塞入繼生口中，並剪斷黃　尾巴，黃鱔痛極，鑽入繼生腹中，繼生乃在暴跳掙扎中活活被謀殺。當塲有繼生之父在旁助虐，繼生之十齡長兄亦在旁目睹，不勝驚懼，脅於淫威，不敢聲張。鄭唐氏就如此效「吞蛇記」之手段，而演出「新殺子報」。該毒婦爲掩人耳目，當晚將繼生屍身裝入缸中，次日乘人不備，將屍丟於附近陰溝中，置之不顧。及十七日晚間，雷電交加，鄭唐氏等駭懼天誅，即於十八日晨，以倒洗面水爲由，佯裝發覺繼生突死，假美一陣，鄰人聞聲趕至觀看，明知鄭等所害，亦不願多事。而鄭唐氏爲事最兇狠，竟將繼生死屍拋入塘中，葬身魚服，以免留下禍根。詎料天網恢恢，鄭福坤長子，向外說出此事原委，經過詳情，在蘭谿四鄉，已有唱道情者，編成小調，四處演唱。</p>
<p>可憐繼生生母范氏，終於五天以前，得悉繼生死訊，而又死得如此之慘，乃於三十日趕來城里，向蘭谿地方法院檢察處投訴，要求伸雪，刻聞法院已出拘票拘得鄭唐氏來縣訊辦。</p>
<h3>東陽黑鉛俯拾即是貨棄於地值得注意</h3>
<p>〔本報東陽四日訊〕金華隣縣東陽的黑鉛礦，產於縣境的大龍山背，離城約七十華里，離巍山鎭亦有二十里光景，該地一片山陵，遍地皆是，有些地方已經暴露在地面上，俯拾即是。（按：黑鉛礦，學名。Graphite，是一種結晶體的炭，以錫蘭等處產量最多，質不甚堅硬，灰色，有光澤，普通用來製筆鉛，其他各種工業用途亦頗廣，如製鋼鐵的坩堝，機器减摩劑，鐵器的防銹劑等。）</p>
<p>在大龍山背的黑鉛礦，發現已好多年了，但開採及經營，還是東陽淪陷之後，自三十一年至三十四年，在敵人盤據期間，敵僞曾欲以武力攫取開採權。但經我自衛隊誓死保衛，與敵爲武力週旋，一直到抗戰勝利，敵僞還是未得染指而走。</p>
<p>這種俗稱「山墨」的黑鉛礦，因爲曾爲保衛它而流過自衛的血，東陽人是更寳貴它了，不過限於人力，財力，不能作大規模的開採，運銷，如今，那礦區裏是已經顯得冷落了，間或有少數鄕民自行以土法小量開採，但是爲數很少，這是値得政府注意的。一般人都盼望能用政府的力量來用新法開採，免得貨棄於地而無人顧問。</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦五日電〕英國世運籌備委員會某委員今日稱：英國籌備一九四八年世界運動會，照常進行。晚報社論之指責，芝；）加哥世運委員會主張易地舉行，將置之不顧。晚報贊同芝加哥方面提議，謂英國在現行經濟狀態下，無力供給地全國所必需負担之勞力與金錢，請將籌備事宜，交與另一國家辦理。惟英國委員會今日重新聲明，英國決可勝任籌備世運事宜，外國運動員可受熱烈歡迎。倫敦星報社論，亦駁斥世運停辦之議，謂「世運聽其舉行可矣。世界各地數千運動員來此，有裨於英國之尊嚴。運動員爲彼此諒解之特使，較職業性之和平使者，有過之無不及。此際停辦世運，將爲失敗主義之驚人表現」云。</p>

<p>（一）收購辦法中第二項規定絲廠收購鮮繭最高價，每担不得超過一百萬元，執行諸多困難，緣本年春蘭最高價，已定爲一百廿萬元。故擬請比照春蘭辦法，規定秋繭繅折以四百六十手計算，標準繭價定爲每担一百〇八萬元。又辦法中第三項規定廠商於十月底以前，應完成繼製所有收購生絲工作，似嫌過於侷促，擬請展限至十一月底。以上兩點，議快電呈行政院採納施行。</p>
<p>擬具秋繭收購辦事須知草案，請公決案。議決由中農行，中央銀行，中蠶公司，及協導會召集小組審查後，呈由主委核定施行。</p>
<p>（三）廠商申請秋貸登記日期，請規定案。談決，即日登報公吿，於七日八日兩日內來會辦理登記手續，逾期作爲衆權。</p>

<h3>本年秋絲收購事宜　由財經農三部督導　訂定辦法參照產銷計劃收購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據四聯總處息：自政府改訂外匯政策以後，我國出口物資，除鎢銻等礦產，及已核定有案之春季蠶絲，及卅五年箱茶外，前經政院決定不再收購，藉以减輕國庫担負，促使各業之自力發展。惟生絲部份，以邇來紐約市價趨跌，出口生絲折合國幣，約計每担値二千萬元左右。本年秋絲，自政府停止收購，則廠商爲减低成本，避免虧耗計，勢必大量壓低收繭價格，因而影響蠶農生計。江浙兩省政府，及民意機關代表，屢向中央陳述困難，請求對本年秋絲，仍按春季計劃繼續收購。行政院全國經委會一再研討，爲兼顧蠶農生活計經核定辦法七項，勉准參照本年春季蠶絲產銷計劃，網續收購。惟繭價最高不得超過一百萬元。春繭貸款部份，並限於十月底結束。至明年蠶絲產銷計劃，並應另行訂定。</p>
<p>又行政院爲督促該項辦法切實執行，以免廠商抬高　絲成本，增重國庫負累計，特明令指定財政，經濟，農林三部，及輸出入管委會，負貴督導蠶絲產銷協導委會，切實遵照核定辦法，分別辦理。</p>

<p>（四）由聯營公司付給紡建公司不能取銷之信用證，或由銀行担保啓運到期收款。</p>
<p>（五）合約以六個月爲期，期滿後雙方並無異議，則繼續有效六個月。倘遇國內外情形有變動時，雙方得於三十天內通知解約。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從市立中學收費說起</h3>
<p>— 祖望</p>
<p>先看市立中學的一張繳費單；</p>
<p>（一）學費：高中三萬初中二萬</p>
<p>（二）雜費：一律五萬四千元</p>
<p>（三）醫藥衛生費：六千元</p>
<p>（四）補充修買費；高中十六萬初中十二萬</p>
<p>（五）賠償準備金：二萬元</p>
<p>（六）制服費：（未定）</p>
<p>（七）敎師學術進修費：（未定）</p>
<p>除（六七）二項未決定之外，高中應收二十七萬，初中二十下二萬</p>
<p>但是問題來了，市中敎職員代表居然考慮到高中進修費應收學米一石（折價四十萬）初中八斗，（三十二萬），經過市長核准，酌改至高中三十萬，初中二十五萬，作爲學術進修補助費。</p>
<p>根據敎育部規定，公立學校祗能酌收一部學雜費，數目還不超出三萬，現在敎育局却違反了這種原則，硬要濫收費用用，巧立名目，視敎育法令於不顧。</p>
<p>何况市立中學是應該帶有義務性質的，旣然是市政府所設，當然一切經費都應取之於市政府，市政府明明不是有一項敎育預算嗎？現在還要向各學生額外徵收費用，則敎育經費大可不必列爲預算項下，市立中學亦大可不必設置了，</p>
<p>雖然，每一學校有25%可」免費，但是僧多粥少，那裏能够分配？因爲從調整後的收費的數字上看，高中恐怕超過六十萬，初中亦至少五十多萬，與私立中學的學費差不多了。</p>
<p>因此，有一大批淸寒學生又將遭受到失學的危機了。從事實的觀點上看：今後上海的敎育危機，不僅要加深，而且要影響到整個中等敎育的崩潰，在今日高呼「敎育建國」的口號之下，我們有什麼感想呢？</p>
<h3>從輕發落</h3>
<p>— 言平</p>
<p>爭執了很久的私校收費問題，總算在顧局長的「從輕發落」的呼聲，和吳市長的秉公處理下，得了個解決。</p>
<p>誰知一波才平，一波又起，市校敎職員，又聯合要求增加進修費，每月由十萬元，增至五十萬元。倘若市府經費支絀，那麼，就向學生家長徵收學米，每人六斗，折合法幣二十四萬元。這要求，非祗給予一般家長們嚴重的威脅，給予吳市長，顧局長又是一個難題！就是市參議會，也認爲問題重大，留在下次討論。</p>
<p>敎育問題，實在太嚴重了，一樁樁，一件件，聯貫而來，不知幾時，才能籌劃出個具體的根本辦法來。</p>
<p>小學敎員待遇的菲薄，生活的淸苦，確是不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>私校敎師的待遇，爲了大部份學校「量入爲出」的緣故，所以不能統一平勻，厚俸的固然不少，菲薄得不够喝粥的，也大有人在。所以私校的提高學費，全因敎師們切身的生活關係，似乎也還「情有可原」。</p>
<p>市校敎師的待遇，係由市府規定，諒必也依公務員的待遇支薪，非但全市一律，更且有實物配給享受，可以减輕物價高漲的成脅，可見市校敎師的待遇，已勝於私校敎師了。</p>
<p>即使市校敎師，猶以爲待遇菲薄，不足維持生活，那麼，祗可向敎育局，市政府，要求提高待遇，千萬不能向家長徵收　米</p>
<p>若是市校一經徵收學米，那私校定然會引爲前例，亦步亦趨的。</p>
<p>家長們才拼檔了巨額的學費，怎能再負祖這學米代金？以及日後網續而來的種種徵費？</p>
<p>最後，套着顧局長的呼聲，請市校敎師「從輕發落」，少製造些失學兒童吧？</p>
<h3>教師是清苦的！　——兼答九月四日清心君問題</h3>
<p>— 一教員</p>
<p>敎師有公私兩個等級，不能混爲一談的。因爲公立學校敎師的特遇，跟着公務人員同樣支薪的。就把高中敎員做標準罷，底薪最高的只有二百六十元，最低的還不能超過二百元，便將最近八月份調整的一千八百倍，再加津貼四十四萬元計算，最高的收入，不過九十萬元零，再加米煤差額二十多萬元，總數也只在一百二十萬元以內。但是得記住，這是公立學校高中敎師長高的收入了</p>
<p>私校敎師的收入，因爲按照時代生活做比例，不同於公立敎師的。事實筆者雖然不很明瞭，但是據淸心君說：每位高中敎師，月薪可以取到五百餘萬元，而且在開學時，可以先支四個月。這一種待遇在市校敎師聽了，似乎在講神話！但是按照戰前生活做比例，那五百餘萬元，也不過買十來石米，僅値以前八九十元罷了。試問那側時候，用八九十元能延聘一位高中敎師嗎？所以這們一推想，私校敎師就是眞得五百餘萬元一月，也未足爲奇。何况這是抽象的，能個個私校敎師，月收五百萬元嗎？</p>
<p>「德隆望重的校長先生們，却寗願背學店之名，受人唾駡，而不肯抑低學費呢？究竟誰剝削了敎師的生活？」淸心君末了這幾句結論，却說得鞭辟入理。這們講，淸心君雖然是一個還在讀書的學生，觀察社會的眼光，却很不差。因爲就是像你這們計算，貴校的敎師，雖然吃了一月的粉筆灰，事實上決定不能得到你預定的數目的。那麼多餘的款項，那裏去了呢？當然給你說個準着，預備擴展學店先行充實那些德隆望重先生們的荷包了！</p>
<p>再說公立敎師的苦處，便是八月份調整，普加每人十萬元津貼的差額金，到今天（九月四日）還沒有拿到。這幾天市上的漲風，又是這麼瘋在，敎師只有孤身一個人的話，拿了百十萬元，只够吃個飽。假如有父母妻子的話，只好一齊請他們喝西北風！</p>
<p>淸心君你是淸苦的子弟，當能體會淸苦的敎師。假如你的家長，也當公立敎師時，別說能籌學費書籍費，就是你的襪子破了，也只好聽你赤足呢。</p>
<p>總而言之，我們是傻瓜，在敎育界不肯混個私立校長做，在社會上不願進身到講生活指數的工廠裏去。爲了後一代，死守了本位，是活該淸苦的！</p>
<h3>學店插曲</h3>
<p>— 王燃犀</p>
<p>——有人假借獎學金名義在賺報名費</p>
<p>近日在報端發現有淸寒獎學金廣吿數起。其辦法頗爲特別，例如最近新聞報上所刋一則：</p>
<p>慧敏淸寒獎學金招生：</p>
<p>（一）宗旨：獎勵優秀學生救濟淸寒子弟</p>
<p>（二）名額：高初中各級全學費生半學費生共三百名，保送各校肄業。</p>
<p>（三）申請日期：九月三日起至廿三日止。</p>
<p>（四）申請處：寳山路××××大學第二院，簡章備索。</p>
<p>試間三百名高初中學費，平均以每名五十萬計，至少須一億五千萬，如此鉅款，從何處籌來？假如眞有如此鉅款，自必有社會聲望人士主持，今主持之人旣不其名，僅假借××大學招牌，顯係滑頭騙局。高初中學校大約均在九月十日以前開學上課，而申請日期遲至九廿三日，並云保送各校疑業，不知究能保送何校？憑何資格可以保送各校肄業？上海若眞有此稱熱心獎勵優秀學生救濟清寒子弟至三百名之多之大慈善家，可謂千古奇聞。</p>
<p>在「慧敏」之前尙有「念慈」，同在××大學，是×大已成慈善機關，亦出情理之外。</p>
<p>究其內幕，實在是幾位無聊學生所設騙局，目的僅在騙取報名費。表面上仍舉行考試，而錄取名單，則全係控造，如此招考者只好怨自己不優秀，因爲「念慈」頗有所獲，「慧敏」遂接踵而起，似此撞騙不已，淸寒子弟，必將受害無窮。因此不惜揭穿黑幕，除希望淸寒弟不再上當外，仍請×大當局及警察當局注意取締，以免流毒。</p>
<h3>學店另一面</h3>
<p>— 胡沂生</p>
<p>為什麼許多人在鑽營校長？</p>
<p>學校瞬即開學，可是各地活動校長熱並未稍减，縣參議員，鄕鎭長，都想做小學校長。縣府科長，科員，也寗願辭去縣職，而擔任小學校長。原來雖混稱一句「公敎人員」，待遇却「敎」優於「公」，設貴爲校長，更可以學費收入存儲生息，每月以息金支付敎職負薪給，學期結束，全部學費收入便可涓滴歸「私」。我們雖不能說所有校長悉屬此類，但至少可說是「大多如此」</p>
<p>因着利之所在，如蠅之逐臭，據說敎育局也苦於應付，原任校長不能悉數更調，有脚路之介紹又未便多所拒絕。此外本年度師範畢業生，轉業軍官應予安插，而調派些局長課長之親友出任校長，也屬理所當然，「粥少僧多」，教育局自然要「難」字當頭，呌苦迎天了。不渦據說榮膺校長新命的，也有他的苦衷，發動攻勢時，費錢，費力，費時，固不必說，一旦新命發表，各方請託安插敎員位置，也費周章。</p>
<p>我親見×校敎員位置六人，除經新校長回絕者外，尙有十五人未便唆拒，最後以抽籤之法決定去留，各憑運氣，才無話說。此事必然引起的結果，就是敎員必隨校長進退。×校自勝利後已四易其長，每次易長，敎員也悉更動，給予學童心理上以極壞之印象。</p>
<p>最近無錫縣敎育局因更調校長，捲起敎界一大風波，最初因委任校長權限歸屬問題，引起敎育局與縣府間之紛擾，繼之舊任校長拒絕移交，新任校長未能接收，對敎育局之攻訐漫駡，報紙也日有所載，誠敎界空前未有之怪現象！敎界原站於領導社會之地位，今乃隨現實社會同流合汚，誠使我們哭笑不得！我疑惑着古諺尊師重道目今將從何說起！</p>
<p>每個家長所渴望的，是自己子弟能入好學校，而學費又能較輕，現在好學校渺不可得，而學費却上漲不已。無錫縣小學校長聯席會議竟會議決：規定學費不能再减，公糧寗願放葉，身爲校長，虧他說得出！而出席校長也會附議決定，眞是怪事！我們疑惑爲什麼不議決：「公糧照領，學費照减」，家長負擔不就减輕若干嗎？</p>
<p>最後，我是民衆，便不能不對代表「民」意的參議會諸公進一言：敎育是神聖的事業，不是以賺錢爲目的的職業，以議長之貴，不便讓其妻其姨濫竽校長，同時以校長而兼參議員固屬衆望所歸，無可非議，但以參議員而鑽營校長，却大可不必。同時我也是家長，我更不得不對校長進一言：古以捐資興學爲贵，所以家中當有的校長，不妨拿些錢出來，不然至少也應收諸學生，用諸學生，不入私囊，涓滴歸公，所收學費，不妨存儲生息，但息金收入應用諸於公，不然的話，以後物價高漲，敎員生活困苦，而欲來一次「尊師運動」，社會是不會同情，我也准會「一毛不拔」的。</p>
<h3>編後</h3>
<p>（一）吳市長打倒學店的作風，我們竭誠擁護。但許多人反對市校征進修費，不知吳市長以爲如何？</p>
<p>（二）原應今日見報之「影壇一週」，移星期二見報。（因屋期一爲科學週刋）</p>
<h3>我參觀了山海鄉校</h3>
<p>— 方仁</p>
<p>—小先生博得鄉民的擁護</p>
<p>記者因爲從事社敎工作的關係，最近曾假一機會，往大塲沈家樓參觀山海鄕村實騐學校。該校前身爲山海工學團，是陶行知先生創辦的事業之一。陶先生生前會主張以小先生制去普及敎育，所以該校施敎手段七的特色，就是小先生制。</p>
<p>所謂小光生制者，是把一批小學生敎得有相當程度，並經渦相當訓練與實習，分組去敎育民衆；民衆到學校裏來最好，有些民衆若無暇離家求學，就把小先生送上門去。此種敎育的設施，當然是活潑之至！</p>
<p>該校在去年二月間復員，當時只來了一個人，更沒有帶什麼錢，可是不久的工夫，就發動地方上的人籌募了一筆款子，蓋了一所簡陋的瓦房，充作施敎的塲所；今年再以同樣的方式，又添蓋了一所；因爲事業逐漸在擴充，還借了兩處民房辦分班。</p>
<p>該校現有敎職員七人，自己不開伙食，由學生家長或熱心敎育民衆輪流供應；不雇一個校役，除了有時學生帮忙以外，什麼都是自己來！</p>
<p>該校在這樣理頭苦幹的情形下，自然易博當地民衆的同情與擁護，所以事業進行，極爲順利。</p>
<p>以上為記者參觀該校后所得一點浮光掠影的印象，詳細的情形，並不欲在這裏多說；只有兩點感想，擬順便寫出來，供社會人士參考：</p>
<p>（一）普及敎育，是當前政府與人民共同亟欲解決的問題；本市文化水準雖高，但仍有半數以</p>
<p>而現在的情形是一邊需要，沒有人去供給；一邊多餘，卻硬想鑽擠進去；這是社會混亂的根源，也是國家貧愚的癥結。</p>

<h3>水龍吟</h3>
<p>— 他山</p>
<p>——和定山先生</p>
<p>憑闌聘目層霄，情懷無限盤胸起，團沙腐草，流　爝火，　空無際；大地沉藐，長天遼闊，寒風凄厲；問遺愁何許，置身高處，舒淸　，觀流水！</p>
<p>自有淸凉滋味，試披襟芰荷叢裏：一枝秀挺，凌波　灑；風裳水佩，隔岸遙呼；未親薌澤，已通文綺。怕陽春白雪，詞高難和，續金貂尾。</p>
<p>再按此詞體例甚多，陳作亦夥；而要以淮海詞爲最膾炙人口。故此嗣一名小樓連苑，即以淮海詞首句爲名也。此詞不同之處，爲前段起二句，及八九句。然各編所刻淮海詞，即有不同。「詩餘圖譜前段末句爲七字，與他書所刻不同，則疑岡譜有錯誤。又後段末二句，有作七字一句，六字一句者。然夷考各家，要以上九字下四字爲最多。如末句四字，第一字當讀，則尤以四字爲正格。茲觀定山先生原稿，有當請益者，如前段「向哀箏何處」下少四字，是否別有一格？抑係排印之誤？又後段末二句，小引中爲上七字，下六字，而所印之詞句讀，又爲上九字下四字。字句本可通融，拙稿則從詞也。尙乞有道正之。（他山附注）　上月十六日本刋載定山兄水龍吟詞云：</p>
<p>「半生湖海豪情，花愁酒祓銷英氣。高秋眺景，迢迢雁字，幾行堪寄？北海樽收，東山事往，尙留賓戲。向哀箏何處，一城絲管（四字原文漏植）櫻桃下，空携妓。日下旂亭賭　。唱陽關，暮霞無際。蒲靑苜碧，望中多少，斜陽飛騎。招隱城西，幅巾獨在，水庭蕭寺。賸人間翠墨流傳秀句，滿江南地。」</p>
<p>依「白香詞譜」定山起句「半」字應作「平』。『幾行堪寄』之『堪』字應作「可」或『好』或『待』，『東山事往』之『事』字應作『人』或『神』或「雲』或『塵』。『梅桃下』之『桃』字應作『樹』或『柳』。『日下旂亭賭　』之『賭』字應作『幽』或『花』或「林』。『斜陽飛騎』之『飛』字應作『縱』或『按』或『放』，『幅巾獨在』之『獨』字應作『猶』。夫詞曲首重聲律，辭意次之，風格神韵又次之。所之得按紅牙檀板急管繁絃而迭唱也。故句中如『賭墅』『飛騎』等典，有不協原律者，祗宜割愛，或另出相當之辭代之。未審吾定山兄以爲然否？東山北海，用孔謝故事，當年逸致閑情，概可想見。而世道蹭蹬，徒留班孟堅客嘲賓戲之文。同爲一嘅。通篇意嫌雜，辭嫌强，氣嫌滯，情嫌疎。然神，理，境，格逼似辛蘇，允稱佳構。惜『向哀箏何處』下缺落四字，蓋是刋排時誤？茲依樣畫葫蘆，戲詠舊情一百二字。巴人下里，聊充貂尾而已。</p>
<p>定山按：此次「水龍吟」和詞凡五十餘闋，美不勝收，均已分別函謝。惟「他山」「約翰」兩先生函未示地址，而詞華蓋代，　論精詳，尤爲欽佩！茲特將原作刊戰，並附拙見如後，畫　則以來件過多，　儘量分別寫正均此道謝。</p>
<p>拙作「向哀箏何處，天涯芳學，櫻桃下，空携妓」。漏植四字，復蒙指出。大作「置」身高處之「置」字用仄，尤佩稱細。下　收拍鄙意若「細看米」諸蘭皆可作「上七下六」，「上五下四四」，讀有行雲流水之樂，故僭擬之。「賸人間翠墨，流傳秀句，滿江南地」固可「七六」，亦可「五四四」，然亦可「七三三」也。師心之作，貽笑大方，仍望敎止。</p>
<p>約翰先生見和原韻，並加　按，尤爲感佩。謹按「水龍吟」依詞律，第一字應作平，「楚天千里淸秋」是也。拙作「元龍未盡驕豪」，以爲未協；故改為「半生」云云。「幾行堪寄」詞律作「玉　螺　」；東山「事」往，詞律作斷，「聲」裘，註云可仄。「向哀箏何處，一城絲管，櫻桃下空携妓」。天涯句漏植「櫻」字誤作「梅」字，均應更正。「櫻桃下」詞律作「無人會」，固平平仄，非平仄仄也。「斜陽飛騎」，詞律作「劉郞才氣」；「幅巾獨在」，詞律作「憂愁風雨」，註云「憂」「風」均可仄，故從之。</p>
<p>詞律云，第一字有用平聲者，不如仄聲起調，從起句可不協韵。尾句「揾英雄淚」，英雄二字連名作多如此。詞律雖多師心之語，然此論確常，故均從之。復改前作也。按掃葉山房「攷正」白香詞譜乃白香原作，而余加以考正者，爲余少年（二十歲）所作。見家君序言。然持論多寬，師心之弊，在所不免。尊引「白香詞譜」，不知何處出版。若爲拙著「攷正」尙祈不吝指正也。至於批評拙詞，可謂洞穿七札，敢不拜嘉。尊詞名雋，極似白石，惟花飛有「聲」，聲字似應作仄，妄論一字，尙乞才宥。（本文稿費移助貸學金）</p>
<h3>又一闋和定山原韻</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>天涯一望神馳；萬千滄海雄豪氣。少年歲月，綺羅隊裏，相思悄寄。翠袖靑衫，朱唇皓齒，倚欄吟戲。恨今朝人去，樓空香杳。聞語燕，傷關妓。</p>
<p>曾記徘徊芳墅，逗幽情，眼梢眉際。花飛有聲，水流無意，雙馱雪騎。最是斜陽，撩人心緒，暗離雲寺。苦迴眸幾度顧儂，別淚灑銷魂地。</p>
<p>酒惡時拈花蕊嗅　別殿遙聞笙歌奏　都冰如</p>
<h3>畫面的美</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>美，初使用於種種塲合，如自然的美，藝術的美，以及用於其他各式各樣的美。這裏，我們僅就屬於最特殊的繪畫的美，尤其是關於「畫面的美」叙述一下。</p>
<p>我們時常說：「這幅畫很美。」但這所謂「畫很美」的意味，可以分作兩種情形來講。其一是製作這幅畫的材料很美；第二是這幅畫的本身充滿着藝術的美，前者是屬於一般外行的頗爲皮毛的看法；而我們所稱的〔這幅畫很美二是　於後者的。也就是說它已達到具有「畫面的美」的水準。</p>
<p>舉個例來說：譬如我們處理一朵美麗的花，不僅是把那朶花描繪得惟　惟肖，使之保留着自然的存在能就算了事，而是要將其逼眞的自然存在態還原於藝術的存在態不可。也就是說，在繪畫的塲合，我們所要求的不是自然的還原，而是繪畫的還原。</p>
<p>所謂「繪畫的還原」者，是爲獲取繪畫的效果而否完自然所有的美，那首先不得不爲畫家的感受性所截取。那就是說，自然的在在的美麗的花朶，通過畫家的感受性，再現於　面上的花朶，已不是自然的存在態的花朵，而是已被還原於藝術的存在態的花朶了。這就是自然的美還原於繪畫的美的意思。而我們稱這種存在於畫家心坎中的花，只是一種花的繪畫的形象。</p>
<p>這種所謂形象，不得不加以繪畫的實在化，「現實化」。為將這種繪畫的花的形象作爲繪畫而現實化起見，又不得不使用繪畫的材料和技巧。因此，產生了所謂「美的還原」（Aesthetische　Reduktion），使繪畫的形象具有繪畫的美。</p>
<p>爲使逍種具有繪畫的美的形象，現實化爲繪畫起見，又不得不研究到所謂「繪畫的效果」。</p>
<p>再舉個例來說：譬如某一個早春時節的鄕村，大麥還祗開始吐着嫩芽，出現於眼前的多是赤黑色的泥土，其上澆着臭氣逼人的肥料，春寒刺骨，還見不到和煦明媚的陽光。一般人覩此景色，未見得能引起如何好感吧！倘若有一個畫家（姑且認定他是一個優秀的畫家）見了這樣一個景色，反感到興趣，感到特殊的美，他從這平凡的自然中，截取了一個具有繪畫的美的形象，可能製作成一幅特殊美的繪畫，與自然截然不同的美的繪畫。在此塲合，可說是畫家已能依據那個「畫因」而表現出「畫面的美」。而自然本身，儘管被認爲是醜惡，平凡，但畫家却能野那自然之中‘，感受到特殊的美；且能將那種特殊的美充分的使之繪畫化，充分的捕捉繪畫的效果。由此觀之，所謂畫面的美，顯非自然的不變原形的存在態的美，也就是說”它是專指那繪畫的存在態的美的。</p>
<p>我們由於上述所舉的例和理論，當可知道所謂畫而的美，就是繪畫的眞正的價値，也就是藝術的美的眞正的意義。所以，在整個畫面裏，不論是形象，色彩，筆觸乃至一點，一錢，均非具有充分的繪畫的效果不可。反之，我們祗能說它是一張着色的照相，不配例入繪畫的領域的。說得更澈底一點，所謂畫面之美，無異是指畫面具有純粹繪畫的效果之情形而言。在這裏，決不容有逼眞自然底自然的美，一切都是已被還原於藝術的存在態的美，一切的美都已成爲繪畫的美了。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「我有我的理由，虎弟！」耀羣這麼吿訴小老虎。　「咱們專打游擊……打前綫去………」小老虎仍舊抓住那一包草藥，挨近了耀羣坐下，放低了嗓子：「反正咱們又聽不懂「鬼唧啾」，，日語）……讓岳老伯去幹那玩意，咱們幹咱們的……」</p>
<p>小老虎的意思，害怕耀羣因係女子，又長得異常美麗，幹情報工作，混入敵人圈內，恐有意外危險，所以需要化裝，率性　顏色都要毀去；假如專作游擊和火綫上的工作，可以免去化裝的麻煩。</p>
<p>「你不懂，虎弟。」耀羣只這麼淡淡地答覆了一句。　「不懂，我什麼都懂，紀姨！」小老虎有些急了：『咱們打仗，不過幾個月的事；再說長些，一年二年罷咧……可是您使了這玩意，邱爺不是說一輩子都沒法兒醫嗎？」小老虎關心到耀羣的終身大事，心下確是有一篇大道理，只是只齒和語句不能達意。</p>
<p>「別要婆婆媽媽的罷，孩子。」耀羣勉强笑着，「一輩子又怎麼樣？……况且我有辦法，我在寨裏試騐過，找到了解藥，誰說一輩子醫不好？」耀羣不願與小老虎多囉囌，所以這麼騙他。</p>
<p>小老虎沒有這麼容易受騙；「有解藥？……那我也要試試玩兒。」這一着找非常刁猾，連耀羣也沒防到。</p>
<p>「別儘嘮叨這個罷！」耀羣想用壓力把題目結束。</p>
<p>小老虎雖沒有往下嘮叨，可是担上心事了。平日這們三十件鍋貼，兩碗麵條，給他一人吃，也可一頓捲光。這時候耀羣還帮着吃了一些，但碗裏還有麵條，盆子裏還脫着二十多隻鍋貼，小老虎却好像咽喉裏有什麼哽住似的，吞嚥不下去。</p>
<p>「虎弟！」耀羣預備把自己的兩個理由，說明一個；因她知道小老虎個性異常頑張，天性也異常純厚，一旦担上了心事，不弄得妥當，永遠不會放下。</p>
<p>「什麼，紀姨？」小老虎率性把筷子放下了。</p>
<p>「你快點吃罷，咱們還有事。你吃着，我把眞話吿訴你……」</p>
<p>「嶼？」小老虎懶懶地重又抓起了筷，兩隻眼睛却灼灼地在耀羣臉上搜索着；要察明耀羣這個「眞話」，究竟眞到什麼程度。一</p>
<p>「咱們担任的這個玩意，什麼都得幹，文的武的，前綫後方，不相干的地段，敵人的圈子裏，有時都得走走。這，大概你都知道，不是嗎？男人們呢，當然毫無關係，可是一個娘兒們……</p>
<p>「我知道，可是……」小老虎想辯論了。</p>
<p>「你聽我說……」耀羣不讓小老虎反駁：「假若專弄情報，就用娘兒們的模樣」出塲，也不是不能够。我也讓給你講過；許多間諜，國際的，國內的，也有不少娘兒們參加。只要模樣兒長得不錯，就靠這一點，反能討到許多便宜，不是嗎？可是幾等人幾等做法，各人也有各人的脾氣。我呢？你是知道的，我可不願意這麼辦……」</p>

<h3>The Overall Situation Has Entered a Period of Pacification; Suppressing the Rebellion in the Northeast Will Not Be Difficult; Soviet Aid to the Communist Bandits Has Become an Ironclad Fact; Bai Chongxi and Xiong Shihui Issue Statements</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, on the 6th, received a reporter from a local evening newspaper, and issued a statement on the facts of Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists and the current war situation, stating: The Soviet Union, openly and brazenly, is aiding the Communist forces in the Northeast, which has become an ironclad fact. Before the Soviet army entered, there was absolutely no trace of Communist forces in the Northeast, but now the Northeast has become the Communist bandits' base camp. The Soviet army has indeed not actually participated in the war, but the Soviet army transferred hundreds of thousands of guns seized by them to the Communist army. Otherwise, where did the Communist bandits north of Changchun and in other areas of the Northeast get so many guns? The facts are all there, why deny it? Mr. Bai expressed great confidence in eradicating the Communist bandits, believing that the suppression of bandits and pacification of the rebellion will certainly be successful. However, he still hopes that the people will maintain strong confidence. He also has a clear view of the current war situation, pointing out that the overall situation has entered a period of pacification. The situation in Hubei and Anhui has been quite tense recently, but this is only due to the wandering of remnant bandits, and it will not have much impact. The Northeast bandit army is indeed about to launch its sixth offensive, but the National Army has heavily defended important strongholds, and Chief of Staff Chen is stationed in the Northeast, personally supervising the troops. The Communist bandits' attempt will not be difficult to crush. As for the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, Mr. Bai believes that Li Jishen and his ilk are causing trouble, but without guns or bullets, how can they form an army? The rumor that there are 30,000 people is absolutely unbelievable, and he believes that it will definitely not have an impact. Mr. Bai also made a statement on foreign policy, especially emphasizing the necessity of self-reliance, but believing that American aid to China is also inevitable.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 6th] Xiong Shihui, after leaving his post and arriving in Beiping, received reporters publicly at his private residence on the morning of the 6th, breaking with precedent. He recounted the process of taking over the Northeast over the past two years, stating: After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the government intended to take over the Northeast through diplomatic means. Therefore, I arrived in Changchun in October of the year before last. Later, because the Sino-Soviet Treaty was not respected by the Soviet side, it could not be implemented, and the hope of taking over through diplomatic means came to an end. During this period, the Chinese Communists took the opportunity to expand their strength. Later, the government changed to taking over through political means, and a three-person small team conducted mediation. In the end, because the Chinese Communists did not respect the ceasefire agreement and greatly expanded their military force, occupying territory, the door to political means was closed again. This year, the National Government issued the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion, to proceed with taking over through military means. The people of the Northeast were extremely excited upon hearing this, and they supported the mobilization one after another, helping the army. The cooperation between the army and the people was excellent. He then recounted his feelings after presiding over the Northeast for the past two years, stating: There were originally no Communist Party members in the Northeast. Because the products were abundant, it can be said that every household was well-fed and clothed. Therefore, they were naturally unwelcome to the Communist Party. In addition, in the past two years, the Communist Party has destroyed industry and mines, scattering the people, which has made them even more disliked by the people. No matter how the Chinese Communists propagandize, it is ineffective. When a reporter asked about rumors of his new position, Xiong said that they were all unbelievable and that he urgently wanted to rest. A reporter said: After the Mobilization Order was issued, how could the director be allowed to rest? Xiong smiled and said: "Change of shift." Subsequently, Mr. Xiong answered reporters' questions, stating: (1) After Chief of Staff Chen arrived in Shenyang, because of the direct command relationship, military and political affairs have been unified. The rumor that Chief of Staff Chen shot more than ten military officers and several civil officials during his previous visit to Shenyang is not accurate. Only not long ago, I shot Ning Bao, the head of the Yingkou Inspection Office. (2) The so-called sixth offensive of the Communist army is propaganda. No such action has been seen yet. It is estimated that there are more than 500,000 Communist bandits in the Northeast. Currently, their main force is on the Shenyang-Hai, Jilin-Hai lines, and a part of the main force is in Tongliao. The Communist bandits' fifth offensive was the most fierce, and the losses were also the most significant. If they invade again, they will suffer the same fate. (3) There are indeed Korean Communists among the Communist bandits. There are such prisoners in Shenyang. We have discovered the axe-and-sickle flag among the Korean Communists, and have also seized Russian-style machine guns. (4) During the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Design Bureau's various plans for the Northeast, such as the division of provinces and regions, were generally correct. However, the destruction of the economy and transportation today is beyond expectations. We still advocate that the Northeast should build heavy industry, because the Northeast is the heart and lifeline of China.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Shenyang Office, 6th] Before leaving Shenyang, Xiong Shihui donated hundreds of volumes of Song and Ming dynasty books he had collected to the Shenyang National Library.</p>
<h3>Chen Cheng Receives Representatives of Public Opinion; Discusses Ways to Revitalize Politics; Eliminates Corruption and Simplifies Administrative Organizations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Pan Yang Office, 6th] Chen Cheng received representatives of public opinion organizations from Liaoning and Panjin at a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 6th. He expressed the ways to revitalize politics that should be followed: (1) Eliminate corruption and actively implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that corruption will naturally disappear, and passively deal with corrupt people. (2) Streamline administrative organizations and merge redundant agencies. Measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The administrative organizations of each province will strengthen their combat capabilities. Mr. Chen also stated: Accepting the opinions of all parties, the Northeast must not be special. With the Northeast's various superior conditions, it is the best experimental zone for implementing the Three Principles of the People. He is willing to work with the people of the Northeast to build a new Northeast based on the Three Principles of the People. The Northeast has been separated from the motherland for fourteen years, and there is a severe shortage of talents in all fields. He hopes to make every effort to complete the great plan of cultivating talents for a hundred years and sow good seeds for the new Northeast.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Shenyang Office, 6th] On the 6th, Northeast public opinion groups presented to Director Chen four suggestions: streamlining Northeast agencies, rectifying military discipline, protecting the welfare of the local people, and revitalizing Northeast industry and commerce, as well as reporting on the general situation in the Northeast. Mr. Chen accepted various suggestions in the form of a symposium. At the meeting, he gave a comprehensive analysis of the Northeast's military, political, and economic situation, clarifying how he is determined to build it, which was warmly supported and welcomed. Regarding the issue of streamlining agencies, it has been decided to first streamline the Northeast takeover agencies. It is reported that the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Assets Unified Undertaking Reception Committee, the Northeast Production Administration, and the Northeast Real Estate Administration will be merged to form the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Undertakings Handling Bureau, with Wang Jiazhen serving as the director.</p>

<h3>The Saying That Du Yuming Must Recover Before Taking on Military Responsibilities Again Is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Office] According to people close to General Du Yuming, Mr. Du's health has recently improved, but according to doctors' judgment, he still needs two months of treatment to get out of the medication stage. The longer the recovery time after that, the better. Therefore, the rumor that Mr. Du will reassume military responsibilities is purely speculative and not credible. Because Mr. Du is a soldier, he should obey the government's orders, but everything still depends on his health. In recent days, Mr. Du has rarely received guests, only meeting with a few friends such as Yan Zhuang.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Visits Datianshi</h3>
<p>Picnics with Wang Lingji and others</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guling, 6th] Chairman Jiang and his wife visited Datianshi today and had a picnic there. Wang Lingji, Sen Jishi, and others were invited to participate. They did not return until 3:30 PM. There was heavy rain here at 4:00 PM, which stopped slightly at dusk. The autumn rain made it feel even cooler.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Guling Office, 6th] Madame Chiang summoned Long Zhiqin, the wife of Hu Yibin, former Deputy Commander of the 96th Division of the Fifth Army, at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. She expressed great concern for the livelihood of Hu's family after Hu died in action in Burma in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic, and promised to send a plane to Maitong to transport Hu's remains to Gan for burial.</p>
<h3>Salaries of Officers and Soldiers of All Units Have Been Issued According to the New Standards</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Executive Yuan has decided to adjust the treatment of military personnel starting in August. In order to understand the situation of the funding and issuance of expenses for various units, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Joint Logistics Headquarters. According to him, the headquarters transferred military expenses one month in advance, and there was never any backlog of officers' and soldiers' salaries. Public miscellaneous expenses (i.e., recurring expenses) were all transferred to each supply area for distribution no later than the 20th of last month, and messy food and horse feed expenses were all transferred no later than the 15th of last month. For areas with military operations, transfers were made as early as possible. The order for the adjustment and granting of the August salary was issued on August 21. The headquarters has already transferred all the additional expenses for the adjustment and granting of the August-September salaries on August 28 according to the standards set by the Ministry of National Defense. As for the price of non-staple food and horse feed, due to the impact of rising prices, the original standards were insufficient. A request is being signed to increase them starting in September. The amount required for September was transferred as early as August 8, and the amount for October was also transferred on September 2. All units can contact the supply agencies in their respective areas to receive them.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Recent Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] People close to the government said: Prices in various places have recently fluctuated slightly again. The main reason is the seasonal relationship, because prices will rise slightly every autumn. The government has paid attention to this and is planning effective countermeasures from the aspects of tightening credit and strengthening controls. In addition to seasonal factors, there are several reasons for rising prices: (1) The British pound has depreciated and cannot be exchanged for US dollars. Hot money from Hong Kong has moved north. (2) Hot money from Hankou and other places has concentrated in Shanghai due to the start of the war. The Chinese people had too much hope for Wedemeyer's visit to China, and prices once fell. This was an "extraordinary" phenomenon, which soon returned to normal. This factor may be a temporary phenomenon or a local phenomenon, and prices will soon return to stability.</p>
<h3>Bai Chongxi Visits Chicks</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Bai Chongxi visited General Chicks of the US Military Advisory Group at 10:00 AM on the 6th and talked for a long time.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Office] Radio broadcast from San Francisco on the 7th: Wedemeyer arrived in Honolulu today and will concentrate on drafting the investigation report to be submitted to the US President in a summer camp on a small island in Hawaii.

<h3>The Ambassador Delivers a Speech in Beiping; America's Position on China; The Purpose of Aid to China Is to Benefit the People</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Ambassador Stuart delivered a 20-minute speech at the Peking University Alumni Association welcome reception at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, explaining the US policy and position on aid to China in detail. The ambassador said that the important international policy of the United States is to maintain world peace, so as to avoid a third world war due to differences in doctrines and interests, even if any country is not subjected to external military or political aggression. As for the US policy towards China, it has never changed, and the policy of aid to China has also not changed. However, aid to China is to benefit all the people of the country, that is, to aid the government supported by the people. This government must have patriotic, non-corrupt officials with status and achievements, who can leave a good impression on foreigners. The ambassador also said that the long-standing traditional friendship between China and the United States, if established on practical interests, will naturally be more consolidated, which is also of great importance to the world peace sought by the United States.</p>
<h3>Leaders of Shanghai Trade Unions Telegraph the United States Asking to Recognize the Crux of Our Situation; The Communist Party's Treason Is the Root of Disaster</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] For the purpose of enabling the US government and the public to increase their understanding of the situation in our country, the leaders of the Shanghai labor community, in the name of the General Trade Union and the chairmen of various well-known trade unions, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, etc., sent a telegram to President Truman and the authorities, making the following statement:</p>
<p>To President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Members of Congress in Washington: We, in our capacity as persons in charge of the Shanghai Trade Unions, and in view of your country's deep concern for the situation in our country, would like to present our opinions as follows:</p>
<p>All of our country's citizens know that the root cause of all the crises and misfortunes facing our country today is the Communist Party issue. If there were no rebellion by the Communist Party, then our country's wounds from the war against Japan could have been mostly healed long ago, and all the difficulties and sufferings we are enduring today could have been avoided.</p>
<p>We hope that the people of your country will not be deceived by the Communist Party's democratic slogans. They believe that any anti-Communist claim is feudal and anti-democratic, but in the areas occupied by the Communist Party, there is absolutely no real freedom. On the contrary, what they use is cruel dictatorial means. Can real trade unions be established in areas ruled by the Communist Party? The answer is definitely "no."</p>
<p>We can take Hungary as an example, where a small number of Communist elements, using their powerful forces, have seized power.</p>
<p>Your country is working hard to prevent the spread of communist aggression in the world, and we have heard that your government is also in the process of purging Communist Party members and their sympathizers. We hope that your country will not think that our people are different from the people of other countries, and that the Chinese Communist Party is completely different from the Communist Parties in other parts of the world. Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Shanghai General Trade Union; Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Huacheng Cigarette Factory Tea Workers' Union; Liang Yongzhang, Chairman of the American Telephone Company Union; Wang Zhenbai, Chairman of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union; Ye Xianggao, Chairman of the Shanghai Steamboat Timber Workers' Union; Zhou Fujiang, Chairman of the British Waterworks Union; Zhang Ziheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Gas Union; Zhou Yunjiang, Chairman of the Huashang Water and Electricity Company Union; Lin Quting, Chairman of the Yong'an Cotton Mill Union; Weng Shanhe, Chairman of the Shenxin Cotton Mill Union; Zhang Ruihua, Chairman of the China Textile Company Textile Factory Union; Tang Guifen, Chairman of the Tongyi Cotton Mill Union; Zhang Wenlong, Chairman of the Hongzhang Cotton Mill Union; Zhang Shiling, Chairman of the Chongxin Textile Factory Union; Chuan Youkang, Chairman of the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Union; Tang Shangyi, Chairman of the China Textile Company Woolen Mill Union; Ling Yingzhen, Chairman of the Shanghai Knitting Industry Union; Hong Meiquan, Chairman of the Yizhong Cigarette Factory Union; Tang Genbao, Chairman of the Nanyang Cigarette Factory Union; Hu Kun, Chairman of the Shanghai Printing Industry Union; Song Zhiming, Chairman of the Mobil Oil Factory Union; Tao Zhizhi, Chairman of the Texaco Oil Factory Union; Shu Jiazheng, Chairman of the Asiatic Petroleum Company Union; Pu Qingyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Dock Workers' Union; Feng Yahan, Chairman of the Shanghai Hotel Industry Union.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Leaves Shanghai for the United States; The Fourth Plenary Session Will Review Foreign Policy; All Parties Hope the Government Will Adopt a Tough Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, our chief representative to the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, along with his entourage Hu Qingyu, Zhang Yuanzhang, and others, left Shanghai for the United States on a Pan American Airways plane at 7:00 AM on the 6th. Those who went to the airport to see them off included Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Wei Jingmeng, Director of the Information Bureau's Shanghai Office, and more than ten others.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 6th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's foreign policy was criticized at the Third Plenary Session last year, and at the Fourth Plenary Session this year, he will be attacked again for "kowtowing" to the United States and being weak towards the Soviet Union. The Fourth Plenary Session is scheduled to open on the 9th. There is now a movement that seems to want to gather strength among Kuomintang dignitaries to demand a thorough review of China's "kowtow" foreign policy. A reporter for the Associated Press, summarizing the opinions of various parties, found that the Kuomintang dignitaries' feelings towards Wang Shijie himself are becoming increasingly激昂. Several of them said that Wang's blind reliance on the United States and his fear of the Soviet Union have made China a sacrifice in world power politics. A certain Kuomintang dignitary said that occasionally demonstrating strength in diplomacy often yields results. The United States has adopted China's opinions twice. For example, the former head of the Chinese delegation to the Allied Control Council for Japan, Zhu Shuming, had disagreements with the United States on the allocation of tonnage for Japanese ships, insisted on his position, and finally succeeded. This is one example. Regarding the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the Northeast issue, Wang is accustomed to concealing the real reasons for the deadlock in the negotiations from the world. This point has particularly aroused the dissatisfaction of these Kuomintang members. An official said: "If the Soviet Union does not want to return Dalian and Lushun to China, it can let the whole world know."</p>
<h3>Explanations on Three Points Regarding Enterprise Group Elections</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding the issue of exercising the right to vote in enterprise groups, the Election Headquarters recently explained several points as follows: (1) This election is a direct election. Occupational groups also vote through grassroots members, not by groups participating in the election. On the commercial group side, regardless of whether their members belong to the local chamber of commerce or the National Federation of Commercial Associations, the member representatives sent by each company, firm, or factory directly exercise the right to vote in accordance with the law. The detailed allocation method for how to participate in the two types of elections will be promulgated. (2) The creation of national representatives and legislators from liberal professional groups will also be determined in the detailed allocation plan. (3) The "national occupational group election" mentioned in the election laws and regulations refers to occupational groups that cannot allocate quotas by province or city and must divide districts for election or elect nationally, regardless of whether the group has a national organization.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Runs for Legislator, Requests Nomination from Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 6th] Chen Lifu, the current Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, whose ancestral home is Wuxing, Zhejiang, has decided to participate in the legislator election in the first district of Zhejiang Province. In accordance with the provisions of the implementation measures for Kuomintang members participating in elections, he has applied to the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters yesterday for nomination as a candidate of our party.</p>
<h3>Strong People in Taiwan Province Still Lack Enthusiasm for Election</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Taipei Office, 2nd] According to the person in charge of the Taiwan Provincial Election Office, Taiwan has the most superior election foundation compared to other provinces. Each county, city, district, and township can complete the registration of more than 2.9 million voters within the limited period. This will begin the registration of people participating in the election immediately. He is confident that the people of Taiwan will be able to successfully complete the election steps. It is estimated that, in addition to some voters who are located in remote rural areas and cannot vote, and women, at least one-third will not give up their right to vote. However, he specifically emphasized that it is necessary to conduct powerful propaganda beforehand so that fair and powerful people who have lost interest in politics can restore their enthusiasm for election. Newspapers have repeatedly published election advertisements in recent days, and some have even been giving speeches everywhere in a persuasive manner for half a year, but their enthusiasm has obviously decreased, which is a cause for concern. According to one of the representatives participating in the legislator election, he absolutely does not want to see an election method of financial activity appear in the province. Only the income tax of the country where they are located.</p>
<h3>Income of Nationals Abroad</h3>
<p>Only the income tax of the country where they are located</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Nationals who have a residence in the country, their income abroad, and the income of the head office or main office of a profit-seeking enterprise in the country from the operation of its branches and offices abroad shall be subject to income tax in accordance with Article 1 and Article 4 of the Implementing Rules of the current Income Tax Law. However, if this income has been taxed separately in accordance with the provisions of the income tax law of the country where it is located, in order to avoid double taxation, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the income tax already paid in accordance with the tax law of the country where the income is located, upon presentation of reliable evidence, shall be deducted separately from the total amount of the income tax payable, or application may be made to refund it to us, in order to show fairness.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Explanation of Election Procedures for National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Members</h3>

<p>(5) When opening ballots after the election, the counties, cities, and equivalent areas, as well as directly administered cities, shall present the aforementioned ballots, calculate them separately, list the names and announce them publicly, and report them directly to the General Election Office for compilation and public announcement and handling in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Inferior Quality and High Prices of Japanese Goods: Foreign Merchants Express Dissatisfaction; Liu Jusheng Appointed as Our Commercial Representative to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] The first group of foreign commercial representatives to Japan, after staying in Japan for 21 days, have expressed considerable disappointment with the inferior quality and high prices of Japanese goods. The visiting merchants have now signed approximately 200 contracts; however, most buyers have expressed dissatisfaction with the high prices of Japanese goods. They believe that the prices of certain Japanese export goods are higher than the current world market prices, making large-scale purchases impossible. Furthermore, unless Japanese manufacturers make great efforts to improve their finished products, the label "Made in Japan" will remain a symbol of inferior goods. The visiting merchants are also dissatisfied with the small quantities of Japanese export goods. It is reported that before coming to Japan from the United States, they had received lists of Japanese goods available for purchase, but the quantities were not specified. Only after arriving in Japan did they discover that the quantities of certain goods were extremely small. The fact that the first group of visiting merchants has signed a large number of contracts with Japanese manufacturers indicates a recovery in Japanese trade, and although some merchants are dissatisfied, it is not a complete failure. About half of the first group of visiting merchants have applied to extend their stay, and it is expected that the second group will not be able to come to Japan in the near future. According to the Chinese delegation, they have not yet received the list of Chinese merchants who will be coming to Japan.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Reports indicate that officials had denied the establishment of commercial representatives to Japan. When the reporter inquired about this with the spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, they confirmed that the opening of trade with Japan this time is subject to strict regulations and is far from free trade. Therefore, the establishment of commercial representatives is indeed necessary. The candidate has been decided: Liu Jusheng, a member of our delegation to Japan, will be appointed, with Cui Wanqiu as his deputy. When the reporter inquired about the situation of public enterprises and private industrial and commercial sectors sending representatives, it was said that the method for public enterprises to send representatives might be revised, and the representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors have not yet been selected. The date of departure of the delegation is currently uncertain.</p>
<h3>Wan Can Discusses the Position on Drafting a Peace Treaty: Caution Against Japan's Comeback; Avoid Repeating the Mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Wan Can, a supervisory committee member and reviewing committee member of the Foreign Ministry's Committee for the Review of the Peace Treaty with Japan, met with reporters on the 6th to discuss the points that should be strongly advocated when drafting the peace treaty with Japan. He stated: "Learn from the past to guide the future. Recalling the story of how the Treaty of Versailles failed to prevent Germany from making a comeback and learning from its lessons will be beneficial in drafting the peace treaty with Japan." The biggest shortcomings of the Treaty of Versailles were fivefold: (1) The destruction of Germany's armed forces was not thorough enough; (2) The dismantling of Germany's economic forces was not active enough; (3) Loans were given after reparations, and eventually, Germany was allowed to default entirely; (4) Regarding the territorial issue, only its overseas territories were dealt with, and no measures were taken regarding its homeland; (5) Re-education efforts were not fully implemented. Based on the above five points, we solemnly put forward the following demands. These opinions are what every Chinese person insists on and are necessary to prevent Japan from making a comeback to harm the world.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Japan's armed forces must be thoroughly and completely dismantled. Even police forces that can be trained into troops should be strictly restricted. The occupation of Japan should continue for a certain period until a truly democratic Japan emerges before withdrawal.</p>
<p>In terms of economy, Japan's losses are much lighter than China's, and its industry is almost entirely intact, making it possible to rise up and cause harm at any time. Regarding the basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission that "a non-war economy can be maintained," the scope and meaning of "non-war" should be strictly restricted. Anything that appears to be peacetime but actually has war significance should be included in the restrictions. Furthermore, MacArthur's suggestion that Japanese industry should be restored to the 1930-1934 level should also be revised, as the period around the September 18th Incident was when Japanese industry had the most solid foundation.</p>
<p>Regarding reparations, we must at least insist on Pauley's suggestion that China should receive 40 percent. In addition to obtaining compensation for war losses, we should also obtain compensation for the reconstruction of industry. Therefore, the reparations should mainly consist of production machinery.</p>
<p>Regarding the territorial issue, the Soviet Union only fought in the Far East for about a week, not only fully recovering its lost territories but even entering some new areas. We should strive to recover our lost territories, such as the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of re-education, this point must be thoroughly achieved. Under MacArthur's rule, Japan appears to have no aggressive intentions, but remnants of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties still exist, secret groups are engaged in underground activities, and Mitsui and Mitsubishi are still operating in the shadows. Ozaki recently even published the absurd theory that Northeast China and Taiwan should vote for self-determination. All of this proves that Japan is far from democratic and that its aggressive ambitions have not yet been extinguished. Re-education work must be actively and thoroughly carried out. The trials of war criminals have been delayed, and recently some war criminals have been released for no reason, which is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Wan concluded by saying that the above points are not profound arguments, but they are indeed appeals unanimously put forward by the Chinese people after a long period of painful lessons. These points should be absolutely insisted upon when drafting the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] It is learned that the United States has decided to proceed with its plan to discuss the peace treaty with Japan with other Pacific-related countries, regardless of the Soviet Union's firm opposition. Some senior State Department officials believe that the only way is to first hold talks with the ten Pacific countries to decide on the date and location of the peace conference, and then invite the Soviet Union to participate.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 6th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, passing through here on his way to New York, said that the preliminary peace conference with Japan should be held before the UN General Assembly on September 16th.</p>

<h3>Smooth Progress on the Shandong Peninsula; National Army Crosses the Jiao River; Pursuing Fleeing Bandits Reaches Outside Pingdu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 6th] (1) The encirclement and suppression of the communist bandits on the Shandong Peninsula by the National Army is progressing smoothly.

Director Dai Anguo and Office Director Xiang Huimin personally presided over the event and reported that the Civil Aviation Administration was established this spring. Its main task is to execute flight safety planning and compile flight regulations. In the past six months, the focus of the work has been entirely on promoting construction work. Currently, the bureau has 190 personnel, technically divided into three sections: airports, safety, and air routes. The Airports Section is currently planning to establish large-scale airports in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Jiujiang to deploy a national basic flight network, which is expected to be completed by June next year. In addition, it is also planning to establish international airports in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Kunming in accordance with the standards set by the International Civil Aviation Conference. This autumn, it plans to establish an aviation technical personnel training school at Hongqiao to cultivate a large number of aviation business talents in preparation for future expansion of the aviation industry and popularization of aviation knowledge. At the same time, it will soon hold flight instructor examinations to reissue licenses to ensure safety. Currently, in civil aviation business, in addition to passenger and freight transport, postal services are ranked first, with the aim of making civil aviation services widely available to the public. As for radio stations, meteorology, and airport facilities, improvements are being studied step by step. However, civil aviation is not purely a profit-making enterprise, so everything is dependent on the guidance and assistance of the government. After Dai's report, he led a visit to the newly established control station, communications station, and new runway at Longhua Airport.

<h3>The Path to Improving Chinese Characters</h3>
<p>— Huang Ruozhou</p>
<p>Writing is a symbol for expressing language, used as a tool for enlightening knowledge, popularizing education, and developing culture. Therefore, a country's writing has a great influence on the people's lives and level of knowledge. Chinese characters are directly evolved from the ancient pictographic writing of our nation, with a long history and pure tradition. Since the Qin Dynasty implemented the policy of unifying writing, it has laid the foundation for national unity. For thousands of years, this populous country, although not everyone can read and write, has been directly and indirectly cultivated by writing. Even foreign nations such as Japan, Korea, and Annam have also been called "same writing". Although weak and repeatedly invaded by foreign races, it has eventually been assimilated by China, which shows that the dominant potential of cultural tradition exceeds any tangible political power. Chinese characters have made the greatest contribution to the cultivation, unification, and development of the Chinese nation, and have special characteristics that are far from comparable to other categories of culture. Political power must take cultural potential as its fundamental basis, and in the future path of nation-building, we must actively rebuild our Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Chinese characters evolved from knot-tying, image drawing, and hexagram drawing to oracle bone script, ancient seal script, lesser seal script, clerical script, eight-part script, and now regular script and cursive script. From the perspective of the evolution of the writing style, it is clearly revealed that from the beginning of the creation of characters to the modern era, in a broad sense, it has been improving at all times and in all places, but the pace of this improvement varies and the methods are different. The current War of Resistance is a great undertaking in the history of our country, and it is undoubtedly a major change of an era. Knowing the changes of ancient and modern writing, observing the past and discussing the present, one will not be confused. As for the future changes, they are vast and boundless, and I dare not speculate on them with my limited senses. However, based on the principle of human evolution and past facts, it proves that this complex Chinese character has problems when applied to modern society. Therefore, in recent years, many educators and literati in China have advocated the movement to improve Chinese characters. Some advocate adopting a revolutionary approach, while others advocate adopting an evolutionary approach. Each has its own opinion, and it is not easy to make a reasonable judgment. Currently, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is holding its first basic education conference in Nanjing. In order to gather ideas, the Ministry of Education convened domestic experts to hold a preparatory meeting. Regarding the issue of Chinese character reform in language teaching, which is the most important part of basic education, there was a very heated debate. Some advocated that Chinese characters should not be changed, some suggested that Chinese characters must be improved, and some advocated abolishing Chinese characters and replacing them with Latinized or Romanized characters. At a time when reform is being advocated and there are many disputes, a slight deviation can lead to a great mistake. Building a nation must first build education, and basic education has an especially great impact. Hu Shi once said: "Regarding the issue of improving Chinese characters, I agree with gradual change and do not agree with abandoning Chinese characters in the shortest possible time. For example, if we completely adopt the national language Romanization, we must completely imprint the logic of Chinese characters into the national language Romanization before we can gradually take off the old robe and put on the new clothes. The so-called improvement is better than revolution." Originally, evolution should come from nature. The improvement of writing should gradually evolve with social culture, and it should not happen suddenly or disappear suddenly. Now, taking the history of Western writing reform as an example, Turkey adopted an active method, implementing new characters and abandoning old characters in the shortest possible time. France adopted a passive method, abolishing tens of thousands of characters each year and adding some new characters. However, according to China's national conditions, especially now that national consciousness is not yet firm and social order is unstable, it is not appropriate to imitate Turkey's approach. Once a nation has a deeply rooted culture, it is impossible to overthrow the old and establish the new. Even the most revolutionary Soviet Union, its modernization of writing still preserves its unique Slavic alphabet, with only slight modifications, and has not adopted the so-called international Roman alphabet of Europe and the United States, nor is there any need to do so.</p>
<p>Chinese characters have multiple pronunciations for one character, multiple characters with the same pronunciation, multiple meanings for one character, multiple characters with the same meaning, multiple forms for one character, numerous strokes, and each has its own historical tradition and unique usage, which is not only difficult for scholars to identify, but also difficult for teaching to convey its essence. This is the fundamental difficulty of Chinese character teaching, which makes it difficult to popularize education and enlighten the people. At this time when the country and society are oriented towards science, modernization, and modernization, Chinese characters must first be reorganized and improved in order to serve as a tool for eliminating illiteracy and achieving the task of popularizing education. Therefore, although we are aware of the close relationship between Chinese characters and our nation and should not abolish them, we hope that Chinese characters should be reorganized and improved as soon as possible. As for the method of improvement, it is most worthy of study. Otherwise, no matter how loud the improvement movement is, the society will still ignore it and cannot play any role. Therefore, the reform of Chinese characters should study and explore its path from all aspects, such as the nature of Chinese characters themselves, the limits of improvement, and the extent to which society can accept it. For example, advocating phonetic symbols is an improvement of the pronunciation of characters, and changing to colloquial writing is an improvement of the meaning of characters. These are all schemes for experts and scholars to seek improvement of Chinese characters. The limits of improvement have also been changed repeatedly in order to meet the needs. Over the past ten years, there have been significant results, but it is still necessary to actively promote it in order to achieve universal development and reach the ideal goal. Writing is nothing more than three aspects: shape, sound, and meaning. Chinese characters have already solved the difficulties in the sound and meaning aspects. At the present stage, only the shape of the characters remains a problem, but this point is more important than the above two points. Because square characters have many strokes and are really not easy to write, everyone dislikes the difficulty of writing, and wants to completely abolish Chinese characters. Therefore, if this point is not improved, it will affect the entire Chinese character problem. The shape of Chinese characters has become chaotic today. In addition to the usual standard characters, there are many non-standard deformed characters. The creation of this type of writing is of course due to the difficulty of the characters and the urgency of application. Therefore, although the unified regular script is taught in schools, students use this type of writing other than regular script, which results in the phenomenon of using what is not learned and learning what is not used. This type of writing naturally increases with the grade level. By the time they graduate from college, the calligraphy they use is similar to the katakana of Japanese. I remember when I was invited to speak on the issue of Chinese character writing at Guiyang Normal College in 1943, Xie Liuyi said in his introduction: "I cannot fully recognize the characters that the students usually copy. Many of them have to rely on a long time to imagine." Therefore, students today do not learn the characters that are taught, and teachers do not recognize the characters written by students. It is possible that they do not recognize yesterday's characters today, and the characters they write tomorrow are not today's characters. Everyone writes their own characters, and each place has its own characters, which makes the characters individual and local. Chinese dialects are complex, and all rely on writing to communicate. If there is no unified writing in the future, I don't know what will happen. If we continue to follow the old ways, I don't know where it will end. Nowadays, a group of young students only seek convenience in application, and have no idea of the evil consequences of destroying writing. This is of course an education problem, and we cannot neglect the trivial details and the initial stage, and we should quickly find a way to save this crisis. Otherwise, the impact on national rule and cultural progress will be even greater! Chinese characters have many strokes, and it is indeed difficult to apply them to writing, so we should strive to simplify them to meet the needs of the times. Before the war, the Ministry of Education issued a kind of commonly used simplified characters, but I don't know how it immediately withdrew its order. For more than ten years, all the calligraphy used in society has become more and more intensified, becoming simpler and simpler, complex and divergent, almost to the point of being uncontrollable. Therefore, domestic scholars have advocated simplified characters, and the Senate has also made this suggestion. Writing is a sharp tool for spreading culture and the external manifestation of the national spirit, and we must not allow it to continue to be chaotic. The authorities in charge of education and culture should follow the path of writing's nourishment, breeding, and proliferation, gradually evolving and transforming it, in accordance with the needs of language recording, and formulate a common and convenient writing style. Due to the society's subtle influence, the shape of the characters will gradually become simple and uniform, and the original complex characters and popular deformed characters will naturally disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>The creation of chaotic character shapes and the difficulty of writing is the only main reason. Therefore, if the writing problem is not solved, even if the character shapes are perfectly reorganized in the future, it will inevitably continue to be disturbed. Because the square-shaped regular script is really not suitable for writing. Every nation in the world has two types of writing: printed and handwritten. The printed type is square and upright, which is convenient for engraving; the handwritten type is round and flowing, which is suitable for writing. Even Japanese, which is accustomed to using Chinese characters, also has a type of writing. The two types of Chinese writing, printing and handwriting, are both regular script, and have been used unchanged since the Han Dynasty. However, in modern times, with complex personnel affairs and cultural progress, regular script has been found to be clumsy, and people mostly write in running script and cursive script. Those who cannot write in running script and cursive script replace them with simplified characters and deformed characters, which increase the efficiency several times compared to regular script. The creation of running script and cursive script in the Qin and Han Dynasties was originally for the benefit of writing and to meet the needs of the time. They have been used continuously throughout the dynasties, but in the imperial examination era, the world still mostly admired regular script. Since the Republic of China, running script and cursive script have begun to prevail, and now they have developed to the stage where elementary school students can recognize running script and cursive script, and middle school students mostly write running script. This is created by the social environment and is also a natural trend. At first, it did not rely on human encouragement or publicity to reach this point. The reason why it is popular throughout the country is purely created by the atmosphere, and systems, articles, and academic studies must all be influenced by the times. For the same reason, the calligraphy currently used in society can be said to be mainly running script. Unless there are legal regulations and the limitations of respecting accumulated habits, regular script must be used. However, since the advent of the Chinese typewriter, the role of regular script has become even smaller. Recently, Lin Yutang and others have transformed new, lightweight typewriters, and the application is becoming more and more simple, saving time and manpower, and it is an aid to broadcasting culture. The difficulty of writing regular script in the future can be solved by this. In the future, learning calligraphy in schools can reduce the practice of regular script, and it is sufficient to practice writing cursive script like English. The curriculum standards issued by the Ministry have long stipulated that calligraphy should first seek to be practical and be based on agility and accuracy, and should also practice writing running script and cursive script in addition to regular script. In recent years, there have been many people in China who advocate writing in running script and cursive script. Some advocate using running script, some advocate using cursive script, and some advocate changing to round script, but because they are not suitable or exceed the needs of society and the possibilities of the environment, they have not been widely used. Running script is slightly more fluent than regular script, and cursive script is more fluent and simple than running script. In practice, running script is still too complicated and cannot meet the demand. Cursive script is too simple, and the differences are not obvious, making recognition very difficult. We cannot increase the difficulty of recognition in order to make writing easier. Therefore, in order to meet the demand, we must first study the psychology of children and the masses learning, and we need to engage in sufficient time of experimentation. We should select commonly used and easy-to-recognize cursive script, as well as simple and easy-to-write running script, combine the strengths of both running script and cursive script to become a type of running cursive script, and then reorganize it with scientific methods. It can be analyzed and combined, has standards and a system, and becomes an easy-to-write, easy-to-recognize, easy-to-learn, simple, accurate, agile, practical, and common writing style. Running cursive can use one or two round and connected strokes to replace the square and straight strokes of twenty or thirty strokes, which is much simpler than any other writing style, saving time and effort, and its economy is unmatched. Moreover, there is not much difference between the shapes of regular script and running cursive script. The so-called cursive script has the true meaning. This point is better than other writing styles where the shapes of the printed type and the handwritten type are different.</p>
<p>After the running cursive becomes popular, it will become a type of Chinese handwritten writing. At that time, we will recognize regular script and write in running cursive, on par with the distinction between printed and handwritten writing in other countries. Once the writing problem is solved, the shape of the characters will not be difficult. The knot of Chinese characters currently being considered difficult is not in the recognition and explanation, but in the fact that the shape and writing are not easy. Now that running cursive can solve the difficulty of writing and the complexity of the shape, advocating running cursive calligraphy may not be a bright path to improve individual characters. All three aspects of Chinese characters, shape, sound, and meaning, have been improved, and Chinese characters have become easy to learn. However, it still depends on the active promotion of educators. Teaching methods are the most important key to learning. Those who obtain the method will learn easily, and those who do not obtain the method will learn with difficulty. There are many illiterate people in China, not because of the difficulty of the characters, but because the teaching of the characters has not obtained the method.</p>

<p>[Athens, June 6 (Associated Press)] Sofoulis, leader of the Greek Liberal Party, declared on the 6th that he has completed the work of organizing a coalition cabinet to replace Tsaldaris' People's Party cabinet. He hopes the new government can be sworn in on Sunday. Tsaldaris will have a secret talk with Sofoulis on the 6th, then submit the resignation of his cabinet, which has been in office for only a week, to the palace so that King Paul can appoint Sofoulis as prime minister. Greek party leaders held intense consultations throughout the day. U.S. Ambassador Henderson occupied a crucial position in the discussions. The situation reached its climax with the announcement of the formation of the new cabinet. It is rumored that ultra-right elements within Tsaldaris' People's Party opposed forming a coalition cabinet with the Liberal Party, but their dissenting views were eventually dismissed. The main obstacle to the formation of a coalition cabinet a week ago was the inability of the parties to agree on which party should head the Ministry of the Army to carry out the campaign to eliminate guerrillas.</p>
<p>Further news: The work of forming a cabinet by the Greek political parties is nearing completion. It is expected that Sofoulis will serve as prime minister of the coalition cabinet. The ministers of public security and justice will belong to the Liberal Party, while the posts of deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be held by Tsaldaris.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Expresses Views on Premature U.S. Aid to Europe, Strongly Advocates Prior Investigation of the European Situation</h3>
<p>[Washington, June 5 (Reuters)] Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his views tonight on the proposal for premature U.S. aid to Europe, stating that Congress cannot act in the dark, nor does it intend to issue any blank checks. The convening of a special session of Congress should be done by the President, and the President must also present facts to prove the necessity of convening a special session.</p>
<p>Vandenberg also tentatively set October 15 as the earliest date for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to begin discussing the aid-to-Europe plan, as many members of the committee are still abroad and will not be able to return until then at the earliest. Vandenberg's statement proves that the Republican majority in both houses of Congress is unlikely to accept Deputy Secretary of State Lovett's suggestion to convene a congressional session prematurely to discuss a temporary emergency aid plan for Europe. Vandenberg also insisted that the government must provide facts about the European crisis and recommendations on how the United States should deal with these crises before Congress can take any action. Before Vandenberg made this statement, several other members of Congress had accused the State Department of fabricating the European crisis to achieve its political goals. Observers believe that before any temporary emergency aid to Europe is implemented, the State Department must do more preparatory work for Congress's actions.</p>
<h3>Amount of U.S. Economic Aid to Europe Must Decrease Annually</h3>
<p>[Washington, June 6 (Associated Press)] It is reported that the United States will insist that any aid to European economic recovery must be based on a gradually decreasing plan, reaching zero by 1952. This point has been presented to the Paris conference drafting the needs for European aid. According to officials familiar with the plan, U.S. aid may be $6 billion in 1948, $5 billion in 1949, $4 billion in 1950, and $3 billion in 1951. It is also reported that no decision has yet been made on the matter of convening a special parliamentary session this autumn to discuss the aid-to-Europe plan. After the report from the Paris Conference arrives in Washington, Marshall will submit a proposal to the White House to convene a special session of Congress. The Paris report is expected to arrive around the 16th.</p>
<h3>"Life Magazine" Argues Strongly That the U.S. Should Actively Aid Britain</h3>
<p>[New York, June 5 (Central News Agency)] Those in our country who feel deeply puzzled by the vast disparity between U.S. aid to Britain and aid to China can find another explanation in an editorial written by Luce, the publisher of "Life Magazine." Luce argued that the United States "must" give Britain aid and "must" save Britain from its current crisis because no one who reads news from Britain today can fail to respond with sympathy similar to that of the Blitz period. The article continued: If Britain cannot stem the Iron Curtain, then we will bear the responsibility ourselves, or allow the Soviet Union to expand into the power vacuum. When calculating the cost of aid to Britain, we should also calculate the cost of not aiding Britain. "Life Magazine" advocates that Truman convene a special session of Congress to inform them of the facts and extend the current loan before the Marshall Plan takes effect to save Britain. "Life Magazine" often holds a nationalist viewpoint, but on urgent issues facing American friends and allies, it holds an anti-communist view.</p>
<h3>Australia Sells Gold to Britain to Cope with British Crisis</h3>
<p>[Canberra, June 5 (United Press)] Australian Prime Minister Chifley announced today that Australia has sold 150,000 ounces of gold to Britain to help it cope with the U.S. dollar shortage crisis. Chifley also stated that during the previous period of recession, Australia almost used all of its gold reserves to help Britain cope with foreign payments. In recent years, Australian banks have begun to replenish their gold reserves by purchasing gold from gold mines.</p>
<p>[London, June 5 (United Press)] Qualified sources in the Foreign Office declared today that Foreign Minister Bevin's suggestion that the United States redistribute the gold stored in Fort Knox to promote world economic recovery was entirely his personal idea and was rash, as it had not been carefully considered beforehand. The British government does not believe so. However, British and American officials said in talks on Thursday that Bevin's suggestion had the backing of the government.</p>
<h3>Travelers Landing in Britain Only Allowed to Carry Five Pounds</h3>
<p>[New York, June 5 (Associated Press)] It has just been learned that passengers on the "Media" liner have received notification today that they will only be allowed to carry five British pounds in British banknotes when landing in Britain. This is an order issued by the British Embassy in the United States to the ship because there is a black market for British pounds in New York, so this measure has been taken.</p>
<h3>U.S. Coal Shipments to Britain Stopped</h3>
<p>[Washington, June 5 (Reuters)] U.S. sources claim that Britain will not be able to obtain coal from the United States in the fourth quarter of this year. There are two reasons for the decision to stop shipments: (1) U.S. officials believe that Britain has abundant coal resources and no longer needs to rely on foreign countries; (2) British people, especially those in the coal mining industry, oppose the import of U.S. coal. Currently, the United States exports approximately four million tons of coal per month.</p>
<h3>Truman Returns Home Today; Invites Brazilian President to Visit the US</h3>

Truman also invited Dutra to visit Washington in the near future.</p>
<h3>Australian Government Revises Regulations on Chinese Immigrants</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Canberra, 5th] After lengthy negotiations between China and Australia, restrictions on Chinese immigrants entering and staying in Australia have been revised.

The revised regulations, negotiated by our Chargé d'Affaires in Australia, Zheng Kangqi, with Foreign Minister Evatt and Immigration Minister Calwell, came into effect on July 1, 1947. To express their gratitude for this revision, Chinese community leaders in New South Wales presented a bronze statue of President Chiang to the embassy in Canberra.</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Faces Economic Crisis; Drafts Emergency Measures Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 5th] After Prime Minister Ramadier gained a vote of confidence in Parliament today, he and the relevant cabinet members drafted an economic emergency measures plan, and also drafted a European cooperation plan based on the Marshall Plan. Meanwhile, the Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor have begun an opposition movement to the reduction in bread rations, and there are occasional worker protests in Paris. Ramadier warned that "such movements are tantamount to attacking the national government. Strikes or work stoppages will not increase wheat supplies, but will only stimulate price increases." However, the workers ignored this warning.</p>
<h3>Various Countries Attach Importance to the Choice of President for the UN General Assembly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] The United Nations is looking for a world leader of integrity and impartiality to serve as the next President of the General Assembly. Initial contacts still involve competition between the two major camps of East and West. A UN official described the post of General Assembly President as the most difficult. Initial candidates included Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk, and Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha. However, more candidates are likely to emerge within two weeks. Evatt is opposed by the Soviet Union, but can gain the support of Western countries. The Soviet Union favors Masaryk, and several countries outside the Soviet Union may have no objections, but it is doubtful whether Western countries would be willing to entrust this important position to a country allied with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] According to reliable sources, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will not attend the opening of the UN General Assembly, but may arrive later if deemed necessary.

However, there is a question about Bevin. The British delegation here has not been able to confirm that Bevin will definitely attend, or whether it depends on Molotov's actions. UN observers say that the issues to be discussed by the General Assembly are of great importance to the Soviet Union, and Molotov will definitely attend during the meeting.</p>

<h3>Night Express to Beijing Frightened En Route; Cry for Help from Boy Falling into Water Causes Misunderstanding; Intense Gunfire Causes Train to Be Stopped</h3>

<h3>Express Dissatisfaction with Wage Discounts; Some Silk Weaving Factories Go on Strike; Management Also Believes New Measures Are Unreasonable; Social Affairs Bureau Agrees to Reconvene Both Parties for Further Study</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the Third General Meeting of the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee decided on the wage discount measures for the silk weaving industry on September 2nd, employees of some silk weaving factories in Pudong suddenly went on strike yesterday. Cai Xintao, Chairman of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association, immediately went to the Social Affairs Bureau in the afternoon with the factory owners to meet with Director Wu to report the situation, claiming that dozens of factories were on strike.</p>
<p>He also stated that since the announcement of the measures by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, employees of some silk weaving factories in Puxi felt that there was no discount for those earning less than 30 yuan, but a 10% discount was applied to the entire amount for those earning over 30 yuan, resulting in lower income than those earning 30 yuan. Therefore, they would automatically stop working once they earned the base salary of 30 yuan, which has significantly affected production. Both labor and management believe that these measures are unreasonable. Director Wu explained in detail and instructed them to submit a written report for further study after reconvening both parties. He immediately instructed the Labor Department to summon the union leaders to the bureau for talks and ordered them to resume work immediately. According to the union, only four or five factories were on strike, not as many as the management claimed. It is also reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has learned that the current labor unrest was instigated by the "Guangfu Society" and is considering appropriate measures to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Senators Inspect Police Stations, Generally Recognize Low Pay for Officers</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] City Council Police Affairs Committee Senators Zhang Jiu-zuo, Zhang Yi-qu, and others, yesterday morning continued their inspection of the Huangpu, Water Police, Songshan, Lujiawan, and Changshu branch stations. In the afternoon, they inspected the Lao Zha, Xincheng, Jing'an, and Changning branch stations.</p>
<p>As a result of the inspection by the senators, the more specific problems were roughly divided into two categories: (A) General: (1) All branch stations felt that the officers' pay was too low and that efforts should be made to provide relief. (2) The police vehicles used for urgent cases such as catching thieves at each branch were dilapidated and in urgent need of improvement. (B) Specific: (1) The trend of unauthorized construction is very prevalent. Branch stations such as Yulin Road, Yangshupu, Lujiawan, and Changshu all felt it was difficult to handle. (2) It is not easy for punishments to be effective in cases of children snatching cotton. (3) The lack of traffic lights makes traffic control difficult and vehicles are prone to accidents. The Yulin Road branch station has this difficulty. (4) It is easy for refugees sleeping in the open to transfer to banditry. Branch stations such as North Station, Zhabei, Xincheng, and Jing'an all have this situation. (5) The police bell equipment used for blockades is a legacy of the Japanese enemy and can be used for retrofitting. (6) The Lao Zha branch station and other jurisdictions are particularly lively, and there are particularly many cases of violations of the law. The officers handle them day and night, feeling very hard-pressed, and should be given spiritual encouragement by the citizens. (7) Excrement trucks still pass on the road between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., which hinders public health. This phenomenon exists in the Changning branch station.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Has Not Yet Received Orders to Ban Dance Halls by the End of September</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It was reported that the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference passed a regulation requiring all dance halls in all regions to be banned by the end of September. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the city has not yet received a central ban on dance orders. The official implementation will be discussed after the order arrives. As reported, no matter what the consequences, the order will be implemented. Even if the central order arrives on the 29th, it can be banned on the 30th. However, if you want to solve everything, it may not be easy to do so. Director Wu claimed that Mayor Wu had just spoken to President Zhang on the phone a few days ago, and President Zhang told him about the implementation measures for the dance ban. The Ministry of Interior stipulated that local governments should handle it according to the actual situation in the area.

<h3>Blood Case on Anfu Road: Executive Yuan Staff Member Stabs Old Woman</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Quan Xuchang, a 28-year-old from Beiping, is a clerk in the Transportation Section of the Executive Yuan. His father, Quan Mao-chen, who is over sixty years old, used to hold an important position in the enemy puppet organization. When victory came, he retired and obtained a pension and a large amount of materials, but he did not hand them over to his family and gave them all to his concubine, Zhao Fang, for safekeeping. Zhao is already in her fifties and lives at No. 5, Lane 120, Anfu Road. Later, Quan's father felt that he had lost his reputation and was afraid of being held accountable, so he hid elsewhere. Zhao secretly embezzled all the property. At 8:30 p.m. the night before last, Quan Xuchang went to Zhao alone to settle his father's property. Unexpectedly, Zhao flatly refused. In a fit of anger, Quan developed a murderous intent and stabbed Zhao in the chest with a sharp blade more than a foot long, and injured her hands in four places. Zhao screamed in pain and fell to the ground. By the time the servants arrived, Quan had fled without a trace. Zhao was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Because of her serious injuries, she is unlikely to survive. The police branch station in charge is currently tracking down the murderer.</p>
<h3>Countless Out-of-School Youths Are Eagerly Awaiting; Hoping That Kind People Will Extend a Helping Hand</h3>
<p>In the past few days, we have received many letters from readers. In these letters, there are painful appeals, stern criticisms (of the rich and unkind), and valuable suggestions. Of course, the newspaper's space does not allow us to publish every letter, and we do not have the manpower to reply to every letter, but one thing that we have always strictly adhered to is to humbly accept every valuable suggestion.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter signed by more than 40 poor students. They did not indicate the school they were studying at or write down their contact address, but their words revealed unparalleled enthusiasm. They said, "Dear Editor: Your 'Restoring the Old Scholarship Fund' has been raising donations for two weeks. Although many enthusiastic benefactors have generously donated, it is still too far from the ideal state. Some of us young people have dropped out of school, and some are about to drop out of school. In a nutshell, we need people's help to complete our studies. Now we would like to make a suggestion to you: every generous benefactor should be given special praise, so that, on the one hand, people can be encouraged to do good deeds, and on the other hand, poor young people can have the opportunity to be respected and admired. We hope that this opinion can be adopted by you..."</p>
<p>After receiving this letter, we immediately submitted it to the "Reader Scholarship Committee." After careful discussion of this proposal, the following resolution was made:</p>
<p>"Those who donate more than 5 million yuan to the scholarship fund will be praised by the newspaper and a recent photo of the donor will be published on the local edition to show our admiration."</p>
<p>Now countless poor young people are eagerly looking forward and waiting eagerly. For their studies and for their future, we hope that enthusiastic people will give them timely assistance as soon as possible!</p>
<h3>A French Concession Tramway Line Is Shut Down Due to a Conflict Between a Ticket Seller and a Fruit Vendor; A Mob Fight Injures Four</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 7:50 a.m. yesterday, a French Concession Route 1 tramway, F27, was arriving at the 16th Wharf terminus from Xiafei Road, Fukaicheng Road. A fruit vendor named Chen Genfa insisted on getting on the train at the station and had a fight with Chen Rongfu, the ticket seller of the train, No. 661. The tram driver, the trackman, the ticket seller, and more than ten fruit vendors of the same profession as Chen Genfa came out to help each other, and the fight escalated. The Yimiao Police Branch Station in charge received the news, and Branch Chief Shen Deheng personally led police officers to the 16th Wharf to suppress the situation. They took many people, including the water and vegetable vendors who caused the incident and the tramway ticket sellers, to the station for questioning. Ticket seller Chen Rongfu, trackman Qu Xizhong No. 33, fruit vendor Chen Genfa, Sun Jiaxiang, and others were injured and sent to Renji Hospital. They were all discharged after being bandaged. After the incident, French Concession tramways Nos. 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 were all suspended to protest. The company and the union sent representatives to the Yimiao Branch Station to negotiate. The authorities advised the union representatives to immediately find a way to restore the operation of the tramways on all routes, and not to hinder public transportation because of small incidents. The police station also persuaded both sides to reconcile. At noon, the reconciliation was reached, and tramways on all routes resumed operation at 12:45.</p>
<h3>The Yu Case Was Tried for Half a Day Last Saturday; Police Technician Testified in Court; Bloodstains on Woolen Pants Were Confirmed to Be Human Blood</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The U.S. Military Court continued to be in session yesterday, summoning many witnesses. Since yesterday was the weekend, there was no court session in the afternoon. At 9 a.m., the first witness was U.S. Investigator Hua Luoshi. Hua said that on August 1, he met Ma Lai at the Broadway Building. After the blood case occurred, on August 3, he was ordered to search Ma Lai's bedroom. He found a pistol and a pair of brown woolen pants with bloodstains in his bookcase. The physical evidence was presented to the court for inspection by the prosecutor, the judge, and the defendant's defense attorney. After Hua left the court, Zhao Xianzhang, a technician from the Criminal Division of the Police Department, was summoned. Zhao listed the inspection process, saying that the bloodstains on the brown woolen pants were tested with rabbit anti-human blood serum precipitation, which proved that they were indeed human blood, and the comparison test was accurate. The dried bloodstains on the back seat of the car were also the same. Xu Guoji, a staff member of the Detective Division of the Police Department, stated that he went to the inspection with Zhao Xianzhang, and his testimony was the same. The court then summoned another witness, Mrs. Xie Huiwen, who testified that on the evening of August 1, Queli had accompanied a foreigner of smaller stature to her home to visit her husband, but failed to meet him and left. The court then summoned Xie Zhengyi, who knew Queli. Xie said that he had only known Queli for a few days. On the evening of August 1, he was in the catering department of the racecourse when Queli suddenly came in a hurry at about 7:30 p.m. and asked him to exchange gold bars for U.S. dollars, but he did not succeed because it was too late. Queli visited again at noon on August 2, saying that he had a friend returning to the United States who needed U.S. dollars and asked him to find a way to help. He immediately wrote an introduction note and instructed him to contact another friend. He never saw Queli again after that. Finally, Gao Meiying, a waitress at the Baixuelong Bar on Zhubaosan Road, was summoned. According to her testimony, she was very familiar with Ma Lai. Ma often came to drink. Before and after the case, Ma Lai did not show any signs of unease. The questioning was over at this point, and it was past 12 o'clock. The court ordered the trial to continue at 9 a.m. tomorrow.</p>

<h3>The Background of the Labor Dispute at the Da Zhonghua Paper Mill Is Complicated; Mediation Has Been Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The labor dispute over the dismissal of workers at the Da Zhonghua Paper Mill in Wusong was convened by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 5th for negotiations between labor and management, but no agreement was reached. The bureau believed that the workers had a complicated background and were manipulated by someone, so it temporarily suspended mediation. Now the factory has allowed the second batch of twelve people to be dismissed to first take a month's leave with full pay and wait for them to reflect. After one month, they will be allowed to return to the factory to work. The first batch of sixteen dismissed people accepted the Social Affairs Bureau's suggestion to hire six people, and the remaining 20 were legally dismissed and paid dismissal money. The workers still disagree with this, but four of them have voluntarily collected their dismissal money from the factory.</p>
<p>The Factory Releases the Details</p>
<p>The person in charge of the factory said that the workers who were to be dismissed this time were all temporary carriers who incited the workers in the factory to strike. One morning, Wu Kun and other temporary workers who had not been dismissed forced the workers to stop working in the hope of achieving the purpose of the strike. On the morning of the 2nd, the workers threatened the employees in the factory to go slow. During the chaos, Huang Chuandi, a dismissed worker, accidentally slipped down the escalator while closing the motor and scratched his leg. He falsely accused the official in charge of the motor of stabbing him with a sharp knife. When the dismissed workers caused trouble, the police station took four ringleaders back to the police station. After filling out a letter of repentance, they were released immediately. The so-called arrest of eight people never happened.</p>

Li presented three witnesses, Dong Lingge, He Shizhen, and others. Dong and He both testified in court yesterday. First, Dong Lingge testified that he is currently working for the Yanxing Bank. He has known Li Shiyu for many years. He was responsible for the office of the International Research Institute in Hong Kong, and Li also worked in the International Research Institute. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, the Hong Kong office closed. After that, his contact with Li was interrupted, but he heard that Li was under the command of Li Guangtian in the north and Zhu Jinghua in the south. Later, He Shizhen testified that he is a lawyer and engaged in underground work during the Anti-Japanese War. He served as a senior consultant to the International Research Institute. Li Shiyu was introduced to him by Li Wenzhi, director of political training at the pseudo-Security Command's Cadre Training Corps. After that, he was under his command and engaged in intelligence work. He reported to him in advance that he would serve as a pseudo-legislator, chief of the secretariat of the pseudo-Security Command, chief of the military law office, and chief of the judicial office of the pseudo-Shanghai Police Department, and he agreed.

<h3>Autumn Scenery of Kuling: Chairman's Residence, Rich in Artistic Atmosphere; Mountain Road Construction Plan Shelved</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, September 4th] The portrait of the head of state at the beginning of Hedong Road has now been repainted by Fu Tingyan, with the same size and appearance as before, but the demeanor of the head of state is even more serene and dignified, making pedestrians feel a sense of reverence. It is heard that Mr. Fu has recently painted a medium-sized oil painting of the head of state as a commemoration of his visit to the mountains this summer. (Note: Mr. Fu became famous last summer for painting portraits of the head of state and his wife, as well as Marshal Ma, while in the mountains).</p>
<p>Artist Fu Tingyan's recent masterpieces on the mountain also include Bai Yingdong's Penglai Pavilion, Xiu Feng Temple's Mawei Spring, Haihui Temple, Guanyin Bridge, Five Old Peaks, Qingyu Gorge, the gate of Xiu Feng Temple, and the mountain gate of Guizong Temple. These small watercolor paintings were framed by Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji yesterday (September 3rd) and respectfully presented to the head of state, becoming one of the decorations for the existing official residence.</p>
<p>Yuan Liuxin, the director of the Third Department of the Lizi Society and one of the famous painters in the country, has recently been on the mountain with great enthusiasm for painting. He personally went to Hanpokou and other places to sketch, and has now produced several medium-sized oil paintings. After the head of state and his wife visited the mountain, the autumn scenery of Lushan became even more magnificent. However, the streets of Kuling, recovering from the calamity, have once again seen rising prices. The price of rice, which was 170,000 yuan per picul a week ago, has now soared to the 250,000 yuan mark, a jump of 50,000 yuan compared to Nanchang. The price of a meal in restaurants has also increased by 3,000 yuan per serving, totaling 11,000 yuan.</p>
<p>This year, various places have suffered from extreme heat, and Lushan, a popular summer resort, is no exception. During the hottest days a few days ago, the indoor temperature rose to 84 degrees Fahrenheit, and it still remained around 75 degrees Fahrenheit until noon today. According to an "old Lushan resident," this year is the hottest in nearly 70 years. In this season of heat waves, Lushan deeply feels the depletion of water resources. Apart from a few streets and residential areas with tap water, most mountain residents have to fetch water from distant places. Even the water source for the head of state's residence on Hedong Road is running low, requiring daily pumping with machinery, keeping the machinists and stewards extremely busy.</p>
<p>The Kuling urban area, after the great fire, is on the road to recovery thanks to the efforts of the management bureau. However, in today's "difficult economic times," all construction on Lushan is hindered by this factor. The tragic scene of the fire site at the new intersection of the urban area still exists. The main street of the bustling urban area, apart from a few shops with relatively impressive architectural scale, is still filled with temporary shops built with dilapidated walls, standing side by side. However, the width of the roads has indeed been widened, giving people who come to Kuling the impression that the foundation for the construction of a new Kuling has been laid here.</p>
<p>The electrical equipment in Kuling is indeed more complete than last year, with ubiquitous and bright electric lights, clear and convenient telephones, and quickly transmitted telegrams, truly worthy of being called the equipment of a new city. An ordinary commercial telegram sent from the mountain can reach the recipient in just one hour, demonstrating the speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>After the head of state's visit to the mountain this time, he expressed that Lushan is a tourist area and should not have cars or "honking" horns. The construction of "mountain roads" may be shelved. The Management Bureau and the Provincial Highway Bureau are currently reconsidering this matter.</p>
<p>The first draft of the "Continuation of the Lushan Chronicle," compiled by veteran revolutionary journalist Wu Zongci, has now been completed. Mr. Wu sent two copies. Director Wu Shih-han presented one copy to the head of state yesterday (September 3rd) and stored the other in the library for public viewing.</p>

<h3>Chen Bulei's Appraisal of Cloud and Mist Tea</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Kuling, September 4th] The Lushan Management Bureau's forestry farm harvested more than 30 catties of Yunwu tea this year. The bureau specially prepared beautifully decorated paper boxes and packed them into several boxes. These have been transferred by Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji to important central officials on the mountain. Twenty boxes will be offered to the chairman and his wife. It is reported that Central Committee member Chen Bulei tried this year's new Yunwu tea on the mountain and believed it to be the only famous tea in China, with an incomparably clear and fragrant taste. Even after five infusions, it is still palatable. The bureau plans to expand planting next year to increase production. (Reporter Liu Zao)</p>

<h3>Wuxian County Magistrate Expedites Conscription: To Be Completed Before the 15th</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, September 6th] County Magistrate Wang received an urgent telegram from Provincial Chairman Wang on the 5th, which read: "The deadline for this year's conscription is approaching. The county's quota is still lacking. You must expedite the process and complete the conscription and handover by the 15th at the latest to fulfill the task. This is a major political matter and no excuses for delays will be accepted." Also: "The county has been ordered to conscript volunteer soldiers. As of yesterday, more than 200 are still needed. I have strictly ordered all districts to expedite the process and ensure its timely completion."</p>

<h3>Unemployed Vagrants in Qingpu: Three Ordered to Be Conscripted; Conflicts Occur in Chenfang Town for Several Days; Rioters Seek Trouble with Bao Chiefs; School 核銷 Destroyed, Staff Kidnapped</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qingpu, September 5th] The Qingpu County Government recently ordered the conscription of unemployed vagrants in the county, who will be sent to the province for training and then dispatched to northern Jiangsu to engage in suppression work. Chenfang Town in the county has already sent three unemployed vagrants to the county for transfer to the province for conscription. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, 40 to 50 miners from Chenshan Township, holding the local Bao Chief, swarmed into the town, claiming that two of the three conscripted people were miners from the mountain and must be retrieved before they would stop. The Town Office said that the two had no household registration and could not prove whether they were workers, and had already been sent to the province, so it was difficult to retrieve them. After a stalemate for a while, the two sides clashed. The miners then started to destroy the National School in the town and forcibly kidnapped the staff in the Town Office to the west. The Town Self-Defense Force was aware of the incident and immediately joined the police station personnel to pursue them, firing more than 100 shots. For a time, the order in the town was disrupted and people were panic-stricken. Finally, the kidnapped personnel were rescued from danger and the rioting workers fled westward. The next morning, more than 100 miners, armed with iron rulers and short sticks, came to the town to cause trouble. Fortunately, the county government learned of the incident and urgently dispatched a large number of military police to go to the countryside to suppress them, avoiding a bloody incident. The situation is still at a stalemate.</p>
<h3>New Filial Murder Report: Lanxi Stepmother Poisons; Zheng Fukun Assists in the Abuse; Forcing a Four-Year-Old Son to Swallow Eel to Death</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Lanxi, September 3rd] Recently, the tea houses and restaurants in the county have been talking about a shocking news: the deceased, named Ji Sheng, was a male, only four years old, from Xinqiao, Dannan Township, in this county. Ji Sheng's father, Zheng Fukun, is 42 years old and has married four wives. The first wife had no children and was returned to her mother's home. The second wife bore two sons, the eldest of whom is already ten years old. Later, the second wife died of illness. Zheng remarried to a Miss Fan, who bore Ji Sheng. Before long the couple's relationship fell apart and was dissolved through court. Ji Sheng was given into the care of the mother, Fan, with Zheng Fukun paying 500 kg of grains annually in two installments (February and August) for upkeep of his son. He was also to give him a set of clothes yearly. A written agreement was signed. Afterward, Zheng Fukun did not keep his promise, and Fan married a man named So-and-so in Bajiaojing, Sanfeng Township. Ji Sheng was then sent back to Zheng Fukun. In November, year 33, Zheng Fukun took a fourth wife, Tang, from Tang Village, Zhuge Township. She gave birth to one son. However, Zheng Tang listened to a fortune teller, "Someone will surely die in your family, otherwise your son will not live long." Therefore, Tang had murderous intentions towards Ji Sheng, beating him and abusing him by every means possible. On the evening of the sixteenth day of the sixth lunar month of this year, Tang went to the extreme and tied Ji Sheng's hands. She then shoved a large eel into Ji Sheng's mouth, snipping off the eel's tail. The eel, in extreme pain, burrowed into Ji Sheng's abdomen. Ji Sheng was thus murdered alive, squirming in agony. Ji Sheng's father stood by and assisted in the act of abuse. Ji Sheng's 10-year-old elder brother witnessed the scene, but was cowed into silence. Zheng Tang used the method of the "swallowing a snake" to stage a "new filial murder." To cover up the crime, she placed Ji Sheng's corpse in a vat that night and threw it into a nearby ditch while people were unprepared the next day. On the 17th night, amid thunder and lightning, Zheng Tang and others, fearing divine punishment, pretended the next morning that Ji Sheng had died suddenly by saying they'd discovered the corpse while pouring away facial wash water. Neighbors heard the commotion and rushed to view the scene, but didn't interfere knowing the circumstances. Zheng Tang threw the corpse in a pond as to ensure there would be no more problems. Unexpectedly, the eldest son of Zheng Fukun spoke of the matter, giving an account of the matter. Throughout Lanxi, singers and storytellers have composed folk melodies telling the tale.</p>
<p>Pitiful Ji Sheng's mother, Fan, learned about the death five days ago, that he'd died so miserably. She then travelled to the city and appealed to the Lanxi District Court Prosecutor's Office on the 30th, demanding she be vindicated. It is now heard that the court has issued an arrest warrant for Zheng Tang to be brought in for questioning.</p>
<h3>Tungsten Ore in Dongyang is Easily Found: Ore Left On the Ground Deserves Attention</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Dongyang, September 4th] The tungsten ore in Dongyang, a neighboring county of Jinhua, is produced on the back of Dalong Mountain in the county, about 70 li from the city and 20 li from Weishan Town. The area is mountainous, and tungsten ore is found everywhere, with some places already exposed on the ground and easily accessible. (Note: Tungsten ore, scientific name Graphite, is a crystalline carbon, with the largest production in places like Ceylon. It is not very hard, grayish, and has luster. It is commonly used to make pencil leads, and has various other industrial uses, such as making steel crucibles, machine lubricants, and rust inhibitors for ironware.)</p>
<p>The tungsten ore on the back of Dalong Mountain has been discovered for many years, but mining and management only began after Dongyang fell, from 1942 to 1945. During the period when the enemy occupied the area, the enemy and puppets tried to seize the mining rights by force. However, after our self-defense forces defended it to the death and fought the enemy, the enemy and puppets still failed to get involved and left after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>This tungsten ore, commonly known as "shanmo" (mountain ink), is even more precious to the people of Dongyang because the blood of self-defense has been shed to protect it. However, limited by manpower and financial resources, large-scale mining and transportation cannot be carried out. Now, the mining area is already deserted, with only a few villagers occasionally mining small quantities using native methods, but the number is very small. This deserves the attention of the government. People generally hope that the government can use its power to mine using new methods, so that the ore will not be abandoned on the ground and unattended.</p>

<h3>Far East Basic Education Conference Discusses Textbook Content Issues Yesterday; Representatives Express Admiration for Chen Heqin's Experiments and Inventions</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, September 6th] The Far East Basic Education Conference held a subgroup meeting of the Third Group, Content and Teaching Materials Group, at 10:00 a.m. on the 6th. Representatives from various units attended almost in full. The First Group, General Administration Group, which was originally scheduled to be held at the same time, did not take place. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Pattoni of New Zealand. After the meeting, he first announced that Mao Genye, the representative of Hong Kong, had reported and immediately attended the subgroup meeting. Then, Qu Junnong, the representative of China, reported on the work done by the preparatory committee on content and teaching materials. The representative of India, Mr. Yi Ding, proposed that teaching materials should pay attention to the inculcation of international ideas to eliminate war. Dickson, the representative of Sarawak, believed that even the Soviet Union, which valued internationalism, could not avoid fighting Germany, and international ideas may not be enough to eliminate war. Mr. Sardan stated that his so-called international ideas are not internationalism, but the world philosophy of "all under heaven are one family." Then, they studied the discussion outline provided by the preparatory committee for reference, and expanded all the principles mentioned in the outline that specifically referred to China to be general. The main purpose is that the content of teaching materials should focus on eliminating national and racial prejudices and barriers. Each country should re-examine its basic education materials and may request technical assistance from UNESCO. In addition, it was also passed that children's textbooks should focus on arousing interest and matching their intellectual development. Adult textbooks should focus on their specific needs and important principles such as daily life. When the discussion reached the issue of teaching material language, opinions were quite divided. The original opinion put forward by our side was the simultaneous teaching of the national language and minority languages. Sarawak and others believed that the national language should be the main language. Mr. Louis, the representative of UNESCO, then stood up and reported the decision of the UNESCO Language Group: Basic education should start from the original language (Mother Tongue) of the residents of the local area. Finally, when the vote was taken, most of the entire countries agreed with the UNESCO opinion. Only Sarawak expressed opposition, while Singapore and Hong Kong declared abstention. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m. All representatives departed to visit.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, all the representatives set off to visit at 2:30 p.m. First, they went to Gulou Kindergarten and the attached first and second grades of primary school.

Then, they went to the First District Central National School of Zhujiang Road. Ms. Lu Guizhu, the acting principal, reported on the school's general situation. After an 11-year-old girl delivered a welcome speech, they visited the misspelling test performance in the junior class and the reading test performance in the senior class, and studied them in detail. Finally, they went to the attached primary school of the Central University Teachers College in Dashiqiao. Mr. Wu Youxun, the president of the Central University, personally welcomed the representatives to the kindergarten section for a short rest, and gave a speech with the words "Warm Welcome and Heartfelt Thanks." Then, Dean Luo Tingguang introduced the situation of the departments of the Central University Teachers College, and Director Dian Zhenqing reported that the attached primary school was occupied by the Japanese as a club during the war, the school building was destroyed, and the losses were great. Now, reconstruction is underway. There are now 906 students, and the teaching method generally emphasizes experimentation. Then, they began to visit the various experimental equipment in the junior classrooms, which were of particular interest. Mr. Jia, the representative of India, and Mr. Nelson, the representative of Singapore, also participated in the student tug-of-war game. Director Lei also invited the representatives to be divided into five groups to talk to the students in the fifth and sixth grade classrooms, and answered questions, explaining the students' knowledge of various regions. When the students heard about the customs and cultures of the people in various places, they were all very happy. The students expressed their concern for the students of the same grade in various places, and asked the representatives to take letters of greeting. Finally, after receiving tea and snacks, they left. At 9:00 p.m., the Ministry of Education hosted all the representatives and ambassadors from various countries to enjoy Chinese music and frontier dances at Jieshou Hall.</p>

The Evening News agreed with the Chicago proposal, saying that Britain, in its current economic state, cannot afford the labor and money required to host the event, and asked that the preparations be handed over to another country. However, the British Committee reiterated today that Britain is fully capable of preparing for the World Games, and foreign athletes will be warmly welcomed. An editorial in the London Star also refuted the proposal to cancel the World Games, saying, "Let the World Games take place. It will benefit Britain's dignity for thousands of athletes from all over the world to come here. Athletes are better envoys of mutual understanding than professional peace envoys. Canceling the World Games at this time would be a shocking expression of defeatism."</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Price Reduced Yesterday, US Dollar Benchmark Price 40,000 Yuan, Gold Purchase Price Changed to 1.6 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The foreign exchange market price was reduced for the first time yesterday by the designated banks, China, Communications, Citibank, HSBC and other four banks, with the approval of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. The US dollar benchmark price was adjusted to 40,000 yuan. Based on this ratio, the benchmark prices of other countries' currencies are: British pound 118,000 yuan, Hong Kong dollar 7,375 yuan, and rupee 8,850 yuan. The buying and selling prices of the designated banks yesterday were: US dollar buy 39,500 yuan, sell 40,500 yuan. British pound buy 116,500 yuan, sell 119,500 yuan. Hong Kong dollar buy 7,250 yuan, sell 7,500 yuan. Rupee buy 8,700 yuan, sell 9,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to various related parties, the main reason for the initial reduction in the exchange rate is to balance supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Also, because the black market exchange rate continues to exist, it has a considerable impact on our overseas remittances, so the necessary and reasonable adjustments to the exchange rate are made based on the actual situation.</p>
<p>Also, the Central Bank's purchase price for gold was stipulated to be 40 US dollars per tael. Yesterday, because the US dollar benchmark rate had risen to 40,000 yuan, the bank's purchase price for gold was also increased to 1.6 million yuan per tael in legal currency.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Treasury Bill Issuance Amount, 20 Million US Dollars in September, Central Bank to Start Issuance Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the short-term treasury bills for 1947 were sold at market prices, they have aroused the interest of general investors, and it is expected that buyers will be more enthusiastic, and the speculative atmosphere can also be shifted, so that the financial market is brought into the right track. However, after the sudden concentration of floating funds in treasury bills, it is inevitable that the market will be excessively tightened, and the government's burden will inevitably increase when the principal and interest are due. In view of this, the authorities decided that the Ministry of Finance will stipulate the issuance amount on a monthly basis and notify the National Bank to follow suit. It is heard that the National Bank will determine the quotas according to the 19 designated issuing areas to facilitate the issuance. It is also known that the issuance amount for September has been set by the Ministry of Finance at 20 million US dollars. The National Bank will start issuing on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank have recently discussed and improved the method of continuing to issue the 1947 US Dollar Bonds and short-term treasury bills. (1) The issuance amount of short-term treasury bills for each subsequent month will be stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank will be notified, and the Central Bank will notify and plan the distribution of issuance in various places. (2) The US dollar bonds will temporarily be purchased in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the US Dollar Bond Regulations, that is, limited to the purchase with US dollar deposits or US dollar cash. Purchasers who purchase with US dollar cash are exempt from the exchange fee. The provisions of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same article, which allow purchase with deposits or cash in other foreign currencies and gold, are temporarily suspended. The above two measures have been telegraphed by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank for reference and implementation.</p>

<h3>Assistance and Guidance Committee for Silk Production and Sales Discusses Autumn Cocoon Purchase Methods</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The 19th regular meeting of the Assistance and Guidance Committee for Silk Production and Sales, under the Ministries of Agriculture and Economy, was held at the Central Bank conference room yesterday, the 6th, starting at 10:00 AM. More than 20 people attended, including Chu Fucheng, Leng Yuqiu, Xu Boyuan, and Wan Jingzhong. Chairman Tan Xihong reported on the negotiation and procurement of autumn cocoon loans in Beijing. Then, Xu Baiguo, representing the government, explained the significance and process of the decision to continue purchasing cocoons and the seven related measures. Subsequently, Leng Yuqiu, Chu Fucheng, Liu Gongyun, and others expressed their opinions. Finally, several important matters were discussed, detailed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the second item in the purchase methods, which stipulates that the maximum price for fresh cocoons purchased by silk factories should not exceed 1 million yuan per dan, there are many difficulties in implementation. This is because the maximum price for spring cocoons this year has already been set at 1.2 million yuan. Therefore, it is proposed to follow the spring cocoon method and stipulate that autumn cocoon reeling be calculated at 460 skeins, with the standard cocoon price set at 1.08 million yuan per dan. Furthermore, the third item in the methods stipulates that manufacturers should complete all subsequent processing of purchased raw silk before the end of October, which seems too tight. It is proposed to extend the deadline to the end of November. Regarding the above two points, it was decided to send an urgent telegram to the Executive Yuan for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>A draft of "Guidelines for Autumn Cocoon Purchase Affairs" was prepared for resolution. It was resolved that the draft would be reviewed by a small group convened by the Farmers Bank of China, the Central Bank, the China Silk Corporation, and the Assistance and Guidance Committee, and then submitted to the chairman for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>(3) It is requested that a date be set for manufacturers to register for autumn loans. It was decided that a public announcement would be made immediately in the newspaper, and registration procedures would be handled at the committee within two days, the 7th and 8th. Late applications will be considered a waiver of rights.</p>
<h3>Reduction in the Price of Rayon Allocation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau held a meeting yesterday to decide on the allocation price of rayon this week.

<p>Furthermore, the amount of rayon allocated by the Bureau for August was 2059 and 13/20 boxes for manufacturers in this city, and 484 boxes for manufacturers outside this city, totaling 2543 and 13/20 boxes allocated.</p>
<h3>Weak Actual Sales of Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 7,000 shi (石) or more of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. After the price increases, the prices are too high, and shopkeepers are hesitant. Actual sales are sluggish. Indica rice has fallen back by 10,000 yuan, and the price of polished rice has also fallen by 35,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. The price of new Du polished rice and new polished rice has increased sharply by 120,000 yuan, while the price of white Yuan new indica rice remains stable. The allocation price of flour remains unchanged. Market sales have become smoother, and the price of both standard flour and mixed-brand flour has increased by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales in rural areas are active, with a sharp increase of 23,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sales of bean cake to outside buyers are weak, with prices falling by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Retail sales of soybeans in this city are slow. Oil factories are unenthusiastic due to the sluggishness of both bean cake and oil. Sales to outside buyers are slow, with prices falling by 35,000 yuan. Sales of mung beans are both small, with no temporary fluctuations. The situation is similar for field peas. Wheat is firm, and sales of 20% silk waste are still active, with a firm market trend.</p>
<p>Due to the suspension of red sorghum from Qingdao, the price has fallen by 10,000 yuan. The price of corn from the north remains unchanged, but it is on a declining path again, with a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan, forming a pattern of sudden rises and falls, making it difficult to predict. The supply of new sesame seeds is increasing. With foreign firms suspending operations, cargo owners are wary. Sales are sluggish, with a gradual decrease of 10,000 yuan, and the price of medium-grade sesame has plummeted by 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The allocation price of oil remains unchanged. Market transactions are average. Raw oil has fallen again by 120,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil is stable. Sesame oil has also seen little change. Soybean oil is stable, and clear oil remains firm.</p>
<h3>Autumn Silk Purchase This Year Will Be Supervised by the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Agriculture; Purchase Methods Will Be Determined with Reference to Production and Sales Plans</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to a report from the Four Banks Joint Treasury: Since the government revised its foreign exchange policy, except for tungsten, antimony, and other minerals, as well as spring silk and 35-year tea that have already been approved, the Executive Yuan has decided not to purchase other export goods in order to reduce the burden on the national treasury and promote the independent development of various industries. However, in the case of raw silk, due to the recent downward trend in New York market prices, the national currency equivalent of exported raw silk is estimated to be around 20 million yuan per dan. If the government stops purchasing autumn silk this year, manufacturers, in order to reduce costs and avoid losses, will inevitably drastically lower the prices of cocoons, thereby affecting the livelihoods of silkworm farmers. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as representatives of public opinion organizations, have repeatedly reported their difficulties to the central government, requesting that autumn silk this year continue to be purchased according to the spring plan. The National Economic Commission of the Executive Yuan has repeatedly studied the matter, and in order to take into account the livelihoods of silkworm farmers, it has approved seven measures,勉准 (reluctantly approving) continued purchases with reference to the spring silk production and sales plan this year. However, the maximum cocoon price should not exceed 1 million yuan. The spring cocoon loan program should also be completed by the end of October. The production and sales plan for silk next year should be formulated separately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to ensure the effective implementation of these measures and to prevent manufacturers from raising silk production costs and increasing the burden on the national treasury, the Executive Yuan has specifically designated the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Agriculture and Forestry, as well as the Import and Export Control Committee, to be responsible for supervising the Assistance and Guidance Committee for Silk Production and Sales, ensuring that it strictly complies with the approved measures and handles matters accordingly.</p>

<h3>Starting with the Tuition Fees of Municipal Middle Schools</h3>
<p>— Zu Wang</p>
<p>Let's first look at a tuition bill from a municipal middle school:</p>
<p>(1) Tuition: 30,000 for high school, 20,000 for junior high</p>
<p>(2) Miscellaneous fees: 54,000 yuan across the board</p>
<p>(3) Medical and health fees: 6,000 yuan</p>
<p>(4) Supplementary repair and purchase fees: 160,000 for high school, 120,000 for junior high</p>
<p>(5) Compensation reserve fund: 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>(6) Uniform fee: (unspecified)</p>
<p>(7) Teacher academic advancement fee: (unspecified)</p>
<p>Excluding items (6) and (7), which are undecided, the amount due is 270,000 yuan for high school and 220,000 yuan for junior high.</p>
<p>But the problem comes: representatives of the teachers and staff of the municipal middle school actually considered that the advanced education fee for high school should be one shi (石) of rice (priced at 400,000 yuan) and eight dou (斗) for junior high (320,000 yuan). After the mayor's approval, it was reduced to 300,000 yuan for high school and 250,000 yuan for junior high, as a subsidy for academic advancement.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Education's regulations, public schools can only collect a portion of tuition and miscellaneous fees, and the amount should not exceed 30,000 yuan. Now, the Bureau of Education is violating this principle, insisting on collecting fees indiscriminately, creating various pretexts, and disregarding educational laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Moreover, municipal middle schools should have an obligatory nature. Since they are established by the municipal government, all expenses should naturally be taken from the municipal government. Does the municipal government clearly not have an education budget item? Now, it is necessary to collect additional fees from each student, so there is no need to list education expenses as a budget item, and there is no need to set up municipal middle schools.</p>
<p>Although 25% of each school can be free, there are many monks and little porridge, where can it be allocated? Because from the adjusted fee numbers, high school is likely to exceed 600,000, junior high school is at least more than 500,000, which is almost the same as the tuition fees of private middle schools.</p>
<p>Therefore, a large number of poor students will again suffer the crisis of being out of school. From a factual point of view: in the future, the education crisis in Shanghai will not only deepen, but also affect the collapse of the entire secondary education. Under the slogan of "building the country through education" shouted today, what are our thoughts?</p>
<h3>Light Sentence</h3>
<p>— Yan Ping</p>
<p>The private school tuition fee issue, which had been debated for a long time, was finally resolved under the call for a "light sentence" by Director Gu and the impartial handling by Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Who knew that one wave had just subsided, and another wave rose. Teachers and staff of municipal schools jointly requested an increase in training fees, from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan per month. If the city government's finances are insufficient, then collect tuition rice from students' parents, six dou per person, equivalent to 240,000 yuan in legal tender. This request not only poses a serious threat to general parents, but also poses another problem for Mayor Wu and Director Gu! Even the Municipal Council believes that the issue is important and will leave it for the next discussion.</p>
<p>The issue of education is really too serious. One by one, one by one, connected, I don't know when we can plan a concrete and fundamental solution.</p>
<p>The poor treatment and difficult lives of primary school teachers are indeed undeniable facts.</p>
<p>For private school teachers' salaries, in order to "live within one's means" for most schools, they cannot be uniformly distributed. There are certainly many with generous salaries, and there are also many who are too poor to even drink porridge. Therefore, the increase in tuition fees for private schools seems to be "excusable" due to the personal living conditions of the teachers.</p>
<p>The salaries of municipal school teachers are stipulated by the municipal government, and must also be paid in accordance with the salaries of civil servants. Not only is it the same throughout the city, but there are also in-kind allocations to enjoy, which can reduce the threat of rising prices. It can be seen that the salaries of municipal school teachers are better than those of private school teachers.</p>
<p>Even if municipal school teachers still think that their treatment is poor and insufficient to maintain their lives, then they can only ask the Bureau of Education and the municipal government to increase their treatment, and must not collect rice from parents.</p>
<p>If municipal schools collect tuition rice, then private schools will definitely cite it as a precedent and follow suit.</p>
<p>Parents have just put up with huge tuition fees, how can they bear the cost of this tuition rice? And all kinds of levies that will follow in the future?</p>
<p>Finally, echoing Director Gu's call, please ask the teachers of municipal schools to "lightly sentence" them and create fewer out-of-school children?</p>
<h3>Teachers are Poor! —Also answer Qingxin Jun's question on September 4th</h3>
<p>— A Teacher</p>
<p>Teachers have public and private levels, and they cannot be confused. Because the special encounters of teachers in public schools are paid the same as civil servants. Let's take a high school teacher as the standard. The highest base salary is only 260 yuan, and the lowest cannot exceed 200 yuan. Then, after calculating the recently adjusted 1,800 times in August, plus a subsidy of 440,000 yuan, the highest income is only 900,000 yuan, plus more than 200,000 yuan in rice and coal difference, the total is only within 1.2 million yuan. But remember, this is the highest income of a high school teacher in a public school.</p>
<p>The income of private school teachers is proportionate to the life of the times, which is different from that of public school teachers. Although the facts are not very clear to the author, but according to Qingxin Jun, each high school teacher can get a monthly salary of more than 5 million yuan, and can pay four months in advance at the beginning of school. This kind of treatment seems like a myth to municipal school teachers! But according to the proportion of pre-war life, that 5 million yuan is only enough to buy ten shi of rice, which is only worth 890 yuan in the past. May I ask, in that time, could you hire a high school teacher with 890 yuan? So with this kind of speculation, it is not surprising that private school teachers actually earn more than 5 million yuan a month. What's more, is this abstract, can every private school teacher receive 5 million yuan a month?</p>
<p>"The respected principals would rather bear the name of a school store and be spurned than lower tuition fees? Who exactly is exploiting the lives of teachers?" Qingxin Jun's last few conclusions are very insightful. Speaking of this, although Qingxin Jun is still a student studying, his observation of society is not bad. Because even if you calculate it like this, the teachers in your school, although they eat a month of chalk ash, in fact they will definitely not be able to get the amount you have scheduled. So where did the extra money go? Of course, let me tell you the truth, to prepare to expand the school store and first enrich the pockets of those respected gentlemen!</p>
<p>Speaking of the hardships of public teachers, the difference in the additional amount of 100,000 yuan subsidy per person in August has not been received until today (September 4). The rise in the market these days is so crazy that if the teacher is alone, he will have enough to eat if he takes one million yuan. If you have parents, wife and children, you can only ask them to drink the northwest wind together!</p>
<p>Qingxin Jun, you are a poor child and can appreciate the poor teacher. If your parents are also public school teachers, not to mention raising tuition and book fees, even if your socks are torn, you can only listen to you barefoot.</p>
<p>All in all, we are fools. We are unwilling to mix as private school principals in the education sector, and we are unwilling to join the factories that talk about the cost of living in society. For the sake of the next generation, we have held on to our position to death, and we deserve to be poor!</p>
<h3>School Store Interlude</h3>
<p>— Wang Ranxi</p>
<p>——Someone is earning application fees in the name of scholarships</p>
<p>Recently, several advertisements for poor scholarships have been found in newspapers. The method is quite special, such as the recent advertisement published in the Xinwen Bao:</p>
<p>Huimin Poor Scholarship Enrollment:</p>
<p>(1) Purpose: To reward outstanding students and relieve poor children</p>
<p>(2) Number of places: full-tuition students and half-tuition students at all levels of high school and junior high school, a total of 300, who will be recommended to study at various schools.</p>
<p>(3) Application date: from September 3rd to 23rd.</p>
<p>(4) Application address: No. ××××, Baoshan Road, Second College of the University, brochures available upon request.</p>
<p>Try to ask about 300 high school and junior high school tuition fees, averaging 500,000 per student, at least 150 million must be required, where does such a huge amount of money come from? If there is such a huge amount of money, there must be a person with social prestige in charge. Now the person in charge does not know his name, and only borrows the signboard of ×× University, which is obviously a slippery trick. High school and junior high school will probably start classes before September 10, and the application date is as late as September 23, and it is said that they will be recommended to study at various schools. I don't know which school can be recommended? What qualifications can be used to recommend students to study at various schools? It is a rare event in the world if there is such a big philanthropist in Shanghai who is so enthusiastic about rewarding outstanding students and helping as many as 300 poor children.</p>
<p>Before "Huimin", there was also "Nianci", which was also at ×× University. Has × University become a charity organization? It is also out of the question.</p>
<p>The inside story is actually a scam set up by a few boring students, with the aim of only defrauding the registration fee. On the surface, the exam is still held, and the list of admissions is all controlled. Those who apply for the exam can only complain that they are not good enough, because "Nianci" has gained quite a lot, and "Huimin" has followed suit. If this kind of deception continues, the poor children will be endlessly harmed. Therefore, they do not hesitate to expose the inside story. In addition to hoping that the poor children will not be fooled again, they also ask the × University authorities and the police authorities to pay attention to banning it, so as to avoid spreading the poison.</p>
<h3>Another Side of School Store</h3>
<p>— Hu Yisheng</p>
<p>Why are so many people vying to be principals?</p>
<p>Schools will open soon, but the heat for activities of principals in various places has not decreased slightly. County councilors and township chiefs all want to be elementary school principals. Section chiefs and staff members of the county government would rather resign from their county positions and take up the post of elementary school principal. It turns out that although they are mixed together as "public teachers and staff", the treatment is "teacher" superior to "public". If they are nobles as principals, they can also deposit and earn interest from tuition revenue, and pay teachers' salaries with interest on a monthly basis. At the end of the semester, all tuition revenue can be reduced to "private". Although we cannot say that all principals belong to this category, but at least it can be said that "most of them are so".</p>
<p>Because of the benefits involved, like flies chasing stench, it is said that the Bureau of Education is also struggling to cope. The original principals cannot all be transferred, and it is inconvenient to reject those introduced by friends. In addition, this year's normal school graduates and transferred military officers should be placed, and it is also natural to transfer and assign relatives and friends of bureau chiefs and section chiefs to be principals. With "less porridge and more monks", the Bureau of Education will naturally have a "difficult" word, screaming hard to welcome the sky. According to the report, those who have been appointed as new principals also have their own difficulties. It is not necessary to say that it costs money, effort and time to launch the offensive. Once the new order is issued, it also costs a lot of trouble to ask all parties to arrange the positions of teachers.</p>
<p>I personally saw that there were six teaching positions in × school. Apart from those rejected by the new principal, there were still fifteen people who were not easy to refuse. In the end, the method of drawing lots was used to decide whether to stay or leave, and there was nothing to say if they were lucky. The inevitable result of this matter is that teachers must advance and retreat with the principal. × school has changed its principal four times since the victory, and every time the principal is changed, the teachers are also changed, which gives the students a very bad impression psychologically.</p>
<p>Recently, the Education Bureau of Wuxi County caused a major disturbance in the education community due to the transfer of principals. At first, the dispute between the Education Bureau and the County Government was caused by the issue of the authority to appoint principals. Then, the former principal refused to hand over, and the new principal failed to take over. The attacks and curses on the Education Bureau were published in the newspapers every day, which is a strange phenomenon unprecedented in the education community! The education community originally stood in the position of leading society, but now it is flowing with the current society, which really makes us cry and laugh! I wonder what the ancient saying "respect teachers and respect the Tao" will start from now on!</p>
<p>What every parent desires is that their children can enter good schools and that the tuition fees can be lighter. Now good schools are hard to come by, but tuition fees are rising. The joint meeting of elementary school principals in Wuxi County actually decided: it is stipulated that tuition fees cannot be reduced anymore, and the public food is willing to be released as leaves. As the principal, he can say it! And the principals present also seconded the decision, which is really strange! We wonder why not decide: "Public food is received as usual, and tuition fees are reduced as usual". Wouldn't the burden on parents be reduced somewhat?</p>
<p>Finally, I am the people, and I cannot help but say a word to the gentlemen of the Council who represent the "people": Education is a sacred career, not an occupation with the purpose of making money. It is inconvenient for the speaker to let his wife and aunt fill the post of principal in order to take advantage of him. At the same time, it is well-deserved and beyond reproach for the principal to serve as a councilor at the same time, but it is unnecessary for the councilor to run a school. At the same time, I am also a parent. I have to say a word to the principal: In ancient times, donating money to build schools was considered expensive, so the principal in the family might as well take some money out, or at least use it from the students and for the students, without entering his private pocket, and return it to the public in small amounts. The tuition fees collected may as well be deposited and earned interest, but the interest income should be used for public affairs. Otherwise, in the future, when prices rise and teachers live in hardship, the society will not sympathize and I will "not pull out a hair" if I want to start a "respect for teachers movement".</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>(1) We wholeheartedly support Mayor Wu's style of fighting against school stores. But many people object to the municipal school's levy of advanced education fees. I wonder what Mayor Wu thinks?</p>

<h3>My Visit to the Shanhai Rural School</h3>
<p>— Fang Ren</p>
<p>— The Little Teachers Earn the Support of the Villagers</p>
<p>Because of my involvement in social education work, this reporter recently took the opportunity to visit the Shanhai Rural Experimental School in Shenjialou, Dachang. The school's predecessor was the Shanhai Industrial Study Group, one of the undertakings founded by Mr. Tao Xingzhi. Mr. Tao advocated using the "Little Teacher System" to popularize education during his lifetime, so the characteristic of the school's teaching methods is the Little Teacher System.</p>
<p>The so-called Little Teacher System is to educate a group of elementary school students to a considerable level, and after considerable training and practice, to divide them into groups to educate the public. It is best for the public to come to the school, but if some people do not have time to leave home to study, the little teachers are sent to their homes. This kind of education facility is, of course, extremely lively!</p>
<p>The school was restored in February last year. At that time, only one person came, and he didn't bring any money. However, in a short period, he mobilized the local people to raise a sum of money and built a simple tile house to serve as a place for teaching. This year, in the same way, another one was added. Because the business is gradually expanding, two private houses have also been borrowed to run branch classes.</p>
<p>The school currently has seven faculty and staff members. They do not cook their own meals, but are supplied in turn by the students' parents or enthusiastic educators. They do not hire a school worker. Except for occasional help from students, they do everything themselves!</p>
<p>In this kind of hard work, the school naturally gains the sympathy and support of the local people, so the business is going very smoothly.</p>
<p>The above is just a superficial impression I gained after visiting the school. I don't want to say more about the detailed situation here. There are only two thoughts that I would like to write down for social reference:</p>
<p>(1) Popularizing education is a problem that the current government and people urgently want to solve. Although the cultural level of this city is high, there are still half of</p>
<p>And the current situation is that one side needs it, but no one supplies it; while the other side has a surplus, but insists on squeezing in. This is the root of social chaos and the crux of the country's poverty and ignorance.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Shui Long Yin</h3>
<p>— Ta Shan</p>
<p>——Responding to Mr. Dingshan</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing, gazing at the layered sky, infinite emotions rise in my chest, a clod of sand, rotten grass, a firefly's light, boundless emptiness; the earth is silent, the sky is vast, the cold wind is bleak; I ask where the lingering sorrow is, placing myself high, easing my pure thoughts, watching the flowing water!</p>
<p>There is a cool taste of its own, try opening my collar in the lotus bushes: a branch is elegant and upright, gracefully stepping on the waves; a wind skirt and water ornaments, calling from across the shore; without tasting the fragrance, I have already communicated with elegant words. I fear the "White Snow in the Sunny Spring," the words are too high to harmonize, continuing Jin Diao's tail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this Ci form has many variations and many Chen works; but the Huaihai Ci is the most popular. Therefore, this one is also named "Small Building Connected to Gardens," taking the first sentence of the Huaihai Ci as the name. The differences of this Ci are the first two sentences and the eighth and ninth sentences in the first section. However, the Huaihai Ci as printed in various editions are different. "The last sentence of the first section in the Poetry Remnants Diagram Spectrum has seven characters, which is different from what is printed in other books, so it is suspected that there is an error in the diagram spectrum. Also, the last two sentences of the second section are sometimes written as a seven-character sentence and a six-character sentence. However, after examining various sources, the nine-character sentence followed by a four-character sentence is the most common. If the first character of the last four-character sentence should be read, then the four-character form is the most correct. Now, looking at Mr. Dingshan's original manuscript, there are things that should be consulted, such as the missing four characters after 'Where to address sorrowful zither' in the first section. Is it a different form, or is it a printing error? Also, in the last two sentences of the second section, the small introduction says that the upper sentence has seven characters and the lower sentence has six characters, but the printed words have nine characters and four characters. The words can be flexible, and my draft follows the Ci form. I hope someone can correct it. (Ta Shan's note) Last month on the sixteenth, this publication carried Mr. Dingshan's Shui Long Yin Ci, saying:</p>
<p>"Half a life of lakes and seas, heroic feelings, spending sorrow with flowers and wine, dissolving heroic spirit. Looking at the scenery in high autumn, the distant geese are writing, how many lines can be sent? The North Sea has collected wine cups, the East Mountain has passed events, and still remains the guest drama. Where to address sorrowful zither, a city of silk pipes (four characters missing in the original), under the cherry blossoms, empty carrying courtesans. Betting on the flag pavilion under the sun. Singing Yangguan, the evening glow is boundless. Pu Qing Mu Bi, looking at how much, the slanting sun flies on horseback. Recruiting hermits in the west of the city, the turban is alone, the water court is a quiet temple. Remaining the world's green ink, spreading beautiful sentences, filling the land of Jiangnan."</p>
<p>According to the "Bai Xiang Ci Spectrum," the character "Ban" in Dingshan's opening sentence should be "Ping." The character "Kan" in "How many lines can be sent?" should be "Ke" or "Hao" or "Dai." The character "Shi" in "East Mountain's events are gone" should be "Ren" or "Shen" or "Yun" or "Chen." The character "Tao" in "Under the plum blossoms" should be "Shu" or "Liu." The character "Du" in "Betting on the flag pavilion under the sun" should be "You" or "Hua" or "Lin." The character "Fei" in "The slanting sun flies on horseback" should be "Zong" or "An" or "Fang." The character "Du" in "The turban is alone" should be "You." In Ci and Qu, sound and rhythm are the most important, followed by the meaning of the words, and then the style and charm. Therefore, it can be sung repeatedly with the Red Ivory Clapper and the rapid strings. Therefore, such allusions as "betting on the villa" and "flying on horseback" are not in harmony with the original rhythm, so it is better to give them up, or replace them with corresponding words. I wonder if my Dingshan brother thinks so? Dongshan and Beihai use the stories of Confucius and Xie An, and the unrestrained and leisurely feelings of that year can be imagined. However, the world is bumpy, leaving only Ban Gu's "Guest Mocking Guest Drama" article. A sigh of the same. The overall meaning is too mixed, the words are too strong, the Qi is too stagnant, and the emotion is too sparse. However, the spirit, reason, realm, and style are close to Xin Qiji and Su Shi, and it can be called a good structure. It is a pity that four characters are missing after "Where to address sorrowful zither," which must be a printing error? Now I imitate it and playfully sing a hundred and twenty characters of old feelings. Lower class songs of Ba fill the tail of the sable.</p>
<p>Dingshan's note: There are more than fifty Ci in response to this "Shui Long Yin," all of which are beautiful and have been thanked separately by letter. However, Mr. "Ta Shan" and "Yue Han" did not provide their addresses in their letters, and their words are unsurpassed and their arguments are detailed, which is especially admirable! Now I will specially publish the original work, and attach my humble opinions as follows. The painting of the 　 is because there are too many incoming letters, and I will try to write them separately and thank them.</p>
<p>In my humble work "Where to address sorrowful zither, the fragrant study in the horizon, under the cherry blossoms, empty carrying courtesans," four characters are missing, and I am grateful for pointing it out. Your great work uses the oblique tone in the character "Zhi" in "Placing oneself high," which is especially admirable. I think that the humble meaning of the last 　 is that all the orchids such as "Looking carefully at the rice" can be written as "upper seven and lower six," "upper five and lower four four," and reading them has the pleasure of flowing clouds and flowing water, so I have presumed to do so. "Remaining the world's green ink, spreading beautiful sentences, filling the land of Jiangnan" can be "seven six," or "five four four," but also "seven three three." I made it according to my own heart, and made a big joke. I still hope to be taught to stop.</p>
<p>Mr. Yue Han responded in the original rhyme and added 　 comments, which is especially appreciated. According to the Ci rhythm, the first character of "Shui Long Yin" should be in the level tone, as in "Chu sky is thousands of miles clear autumn." I thought that my humble work "Yuan Long has not exhausted his arrogance" was not harmonious; so I changed it to "Half a life" and so on. The Ci rhythm of "How many lines can be sent" is "Jade 　 Luo 　 "; The Ci rhythm of "East Mountain's events are gone" is broken, "Sound" Qiu, note that it can be in the oblique tone. "Where to address sorrowful zither, a city of silk pipes, under the cherry blossoms empty carrying courtesans." The character "Ying" was mistakenly written as "Mei" in the horizon sentence, which should be corrected. "Under the cherry blossoms" The Ci rhythm is "no one will," which is certainly level level oblique, not level oblique oblique. "The slanting sun flies on horseback," the Ci rhythm is "Liu Lang's talent"; "The turban is alone," the Ci rhythm is "sad wind and rain," note that "sad" and "wind" can both be in the oblique tone, so I followed it.</p>
<p>The Ci rhythm says that the first character can be in the level tone, it is better to start with the oblique tone, and the rhyme may not be harmonious from the starting sentence. The ending sentence "Wiping away the tears of a hero," the names of heroes are often connected like this. Although the Ci rhythm has many words made according to the heart, this theory is indeed common, so I followed it. I have also revised the previous work. According to Sao Ye Shan Fang's "Examination and Correction" of the Bai Xiang Ci Spectrum, it is the original work of Bai Xiang, and what I have added to it is what I did when I was young (twenty years old). See the preface of my father. However, the arguments are mostly broad, and the disadvantages of making them according to the heart are inevitable. I don't know where the "Bai Xiang Ci Spectrum" you quoted was published. If it is my humble work "Examination and Correction," I hope you will not hesitate to point out any errors. As for the criticism of my humble Ci, it can be said to be penetrating seven layers, and I dare not but thank you. Your words are beautiful, very similar to Bai Shi, but there is "sound" when flowers fly, and the character "sound" should be in the oblique tone. I recklessly discuss a word, and I hope you will forgive me. (The manuscript fee for this article will be used to help the student loan fund)</p>
<h3>Another Ci Responding to Mr. Dingshan's Original Rhyme</h3>
<p>— Sun Yue Han</p>
<p>The horizon is a glance, my mind flies; thousands of oceans, heroic spirit. In my youthful years, in the midst of silk and embroidery, secret thoughts are entrusted. Green sleeves and green shirts, vermilion lips and white teeth, leaning on the railing and chanting playfully. I hate that people have left today, the building is empty and the fragrance is gone. Hearing the swallows speak, I am saddened by the prostitutes.</p>
<p>I remember wandering in the fragrant villa, teasing my secret feelings, between the corners of my eyes and eyebrows. Flowers fly with sound, water flows without intention, riding double on snow. The most is the slanting sun, stirring people's emotions, secretly leaving the cloud temple. I bitterly turn my head several times to look at you, and the parting tears are sprinkled on the soul-stirring land.</p>
<p>I pick flower buds and smell them when I hate wine 　 I hear the sound of Sheng songs from the other hall 　 Everything is ice like</p>
<h3>The Beauty of the Painting</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Beauty is initially used in various situations, such as the beauty of nature, the beauty of art, and used for other various kinds of beauty. Here, we will only describe the beauty that belongs to the most special painting, especially about "the beauty of the picture."</p>
<p>We often say: "This painting is very beautiful." But the meaning of this so-called "painting is very beautiful" can be divided into two situations. One is that the materials used to make this painting are very beautiful; the second is that the painting itself is full of artistic beauty. The former belongs to the superficial view of general laymen; and what we call "this painting is very beautiful" belongs to the latter. That is to say, it has reached the level of having "the beauty of the picture."</p>
<p>For example: if we deal with a beautiful flower, it is not only to depict that flower vividly, so that it retains its natural existence, but to restore its realistic natural state to the artistic existence state. That is to say, in the situation of painting, what we require is not the restoration of nature, but the restoration of painting.</p>
<p>The so-called "restoration of painting" is to completely deny all the beauty of nature in order to obtain the effect of painting, which must first be intercepted by the painter's sensibility. That is to say, the beautiful flower in nature, through the painter's sensibility, reappears as the flower on the surface, which is no longer the flower in the natural state of existence, but has been restored to the flower in the artistic state of existence. This is the meaning of restoring the beauty of nature to the beauty of painting. And we call this kind of flower existing in the painter's heart only a painting image of a flower.</p>
<p>This so-called image must be realized and "realized" in painting. In order to realize this painting image of a flower as a painting, painting materials and techniques must be used. Therefore, the so-called "aesthetic reduction" (Aesthetische Reduktion) is produced, so that the painting image has the beauty of painting.</p>
<p>In order to make the Xiaozhong image with the beauty of painting, it is necessary to study the so-called "painting effect" in order to realize it as a painting.</p>
<p>For example: in a certain early spring season in the countryside, barley is only beginning to sprout tender buds, and what appears in front of the eyes is mostly reddish-black soil, which is watered with foul-smelling fertilizer, and the spring cold is biting, and there is no warm and bright sunshine. Generally, seeing this scene may not arouse any good feelings! If a painter (let's assume he is an excellent painter) sees such a scene and feels interested and feels a special beauty, he intercepts an image with the beauty of painting from this ordinary nature, and may create a painting with special beauty, a painting with beauty that is completely different from nature. In this situation, it can be said that the painter has been able to express "the beauty of the picture" according to that "painting cause." And nature itself, although it is considered ugly and ordinary, the painter can feel a special beauty in that nature, and can fully make that special beauty painted and fully capture the effect of painting. From this point of view, the so-called beauty of the picture is obviously not the beauty of the unchanging original form of existence of nature, that is to say, it specifically refers to the beauty of the state of existence of the painting.</p>
<p>From the examples and theories mentioned above, we can know that the so-called beauty of painting is the true value of painting, that is, the true meaning of the beauty of art. Therefore, in the entire picture, whether it is the image, color, brushstroke, or even a point or a coin, it must have a sufficient painting effect. Otherwise, we can only say that it is a colored photograph, which is not worthy of being included in the field of painting. To put it more thoroughly, the so-called beauty of the picture is no different from referring to the situation where the picture has a pure painting effect. Here, there is absolutely no beauty of natural nature, everything has been restored to the beauty of the artistic state of existence, and all the beauty has become the beauty of painting.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"I have my reasons, Tiger Brother!" Yaoqun told Little Tiger like this. "Let's just fight guerrilla warfare... go to the front line..." Little Tiger still grabbed that bag of herbal medicine, sat down next to Yaoqun, and lowered his voice: "Anyway, we can't understand 'ghost chirping' (Japanese)... let Uncle Yue do that thing, we'll do ours..."</p>
<p>Little Tiger's intention was that he was afraid that Yaoqun was a woman and extraordinarily beautiful, so doing intelligence work and mixing into the enemy's circle might be dangerous. Therefore, she needed to disguise herself, and even destroy her face. If she specialized in guerrilla and front-line work, she could avoid the trouble of disguise.</p>
<p>"You don't understand, Tiger Brother," Yaoqun replied faintly. "I don't understand? I understand everything, Aunt Ji!" Little Tiger became a little anxious: "We're fighting a war, only for a few months; at most, a year or two... but if you use this thing, didn't Grandpa Qiu say it can't be cured for a lifetime?" Little Tiger was concerned about Yaoqun's lifelong event, and he did have a great principle in his heart, but his teeth and words could not express his meaning.</p>
<p>"Don't be so fussy, child," Yaoqun smiled reluctantly, "What about a lifetime?... Besides, I have a way, I've experimented in the village, and found an antidote. Who said it can't be cured for a lifetime?" Yaoqun didn't want to argue with Little Tiger any more, so she lied to him.</p>
<p>Little Tiger was not so easily fooled; "There's an antidote?... Then I want to try it too." This move was very cunning, and even Yaoqun didn't expect it.</p>
<p>"Don't keep nagging about this!" Yaoqun wanted to end the topic with pressure.</p>
<p>Although Little Tiger didn't nag anymore, he was worried. Usually, thirty dumplings and two bowls of noodles, even if he ate them all by himself, he could finish them in one meal. At this time, Yaoqun also helped to eat some, but there were still noodles in the bowl and more than twenty dumplings left in the basin, but Little Tiger seemed to have something stuck in his throat, and he couldn't swallow them.</p>
<p>"Tiger Brother!" Yaoqun was preparing to explain one of her two reasons; because she knew that Little Tiger's personality was exceptionally tenacious and his nature was exceptionally pure and honest. Once he was worried, he would never let go until he settled it properly.</p>

<p>"I know, but..." Little Tiger wanted to argue.</p>
<p>"Listen to me..." Yaoqun didn't let Little Tiger refute: "If you only do intelligence, you can go out in the appearance of a woman. I also told you about it; many spies, international and domestic, also have many women participating. As long as the appearance is good, you can rely on this point to get many advantages, right? But there are different levels of people and different ways of doing things, and everyone has their own temper. Me? You know, I don't want to do it this way..."</p>
