<h3>本年聖誕行憲開始　主席廣播朂勉全民　應共同努力建設新中國</h3>
<p>﹝中央社南京廿一日電﹞蔣主席應上海福音廣播電台之請，於廿一日晚九時，發表耶穌聖誕節廣播。主席講詞，係先一日在京灌製錄音片寄滬由該台播送。</p>
<p>主席講詞之末段稱：今年聖誕節，我們中國就要開始實施民主新憲法了，這將是中華民國和全體人民統一獨立平等自由新生機遝　始的一天。並謂：我們認為新憲法的實施，祇是完成我們建設新中國的最後目標的初步，但這對我們中國三千年來專制政體和對建社會是一個劃時代，的進步，我願我們全國同胞，憑着信仰和虔誠，共同一致，努力前進，我相信一定很快的能够完成我們所預定的路程，就是建立我們三民主義新中國的完成。講詞全文如次：</p>
<p>全國同胞們：這一個星期，全世界都在慶祝着人類福音耶穌聖誕的令節，所以各人的情緒，都貫注在人類的親愛與和平方面。世界上所有不安定，不愉快的氣氛，在道個時期，好像是已經减退了。</p>
<p>在這舉世歡騰的令節，我們中國的同胞，亦應該與其他國家同樣的對基督降生，救人救世的福書，感到欣幸和快慰。我們全國同胞，不論信奉那一種宗敎，不論從事那一種職業，對於基督誕生所象徵的「世界和平」，與「人類博愛」這兩種崇高的理想是沒有不歡迎的。我們認為目前世界的許多罪惡問題，亦只有從這種理想中找到解決的答案。</p>
<p>常有人說：一年之中，能表現基督精神的時間太短，沒有法子使一年三百六十五天，天天都是如此的愉快歡欣，這是人類很大的一個缺憾。</p>
<h3>每年耶誕節來臨　應檢討自己生活　整個世界需要基督精神的感應</h3>
<p>但是在我看來，耶誕令節對於人們更有一個重大的意義；</p>
<p>每年耶誕節的來臨，是給我們一年之中一個自我反省最好的時機，要我們眞誠檢討自己的生活，在這一年之中，我們為國家，為同胞，以及為世界人類，所做的工作，究竟有幾多？當我們面對着基督降生這一偉大事實的時候，就當想到下面這一個問題：我們的生活和工作可曾吻合這個欽世主的祟高理想嗎？我們在世上是否眞正在努力締造基督為他人罪惡而自願犠牲的精神所啓示的那個和平世界呢？</p>
<p>這個問題，對於我們的國家生活，對於我們個人生活，都有同樣深刻的意義。因為國家生活，就是個人生活的擴大。在此國際間尙存在着不安定的因素，而人類受着痛苦惶惑試煉的時候，我們每一個人，我們這整個世界，都是迫切地需要基督精神的感應</p>
<h3>認識基督眞理</h3>
<p>我們倘能用基督敎信仰的目光，去觀察世界現局，那末我們所見的混亂和黑暗的現象，立時可顯現爲光明了。我們住此可以知道，任何忍辱，任何受苦，對於我們國家，自力更生，悠長的路程中，都是必然應有的經歷。在中國今日，所遭遇的種種苦痛艱難之中，又要我們確實認識基督救世「以正克邪」，「以善勝惡」的眞理，再能以不屈不撓的精神，毫不籌躇，毫不徘徊的勇往邁進，那就沒有什慶困難問題不能解決的。也沒有什麼苦痛問題，不能克服的，無論是國家統一，無論是民衆幸福，只要依照這個眞理和信仰，努力奮鬥，亦決沒有不能達到目的的道理。我們只要有這樣的信心，無論對任何險惡痛苦的環境，就能勇氣百倍。我們的國家，我們的民族，亦自然就能從全體同胞，共同一致奮鬥犠牲中新生，而成為更偉大的國家和更光榮的民族。</p>
<p>我們現在所紀念的耶穌基督，他對於人世痛苦的理解，古往今來，無人可以與之比擬。他的一生，受到最嚴重的迫害，他曾被其國人侮辱，曾被其親友　棄。如果以世俗成敗的標準，去衡量基督在人世的事業，可以說是最大的失敗。然而他最後的成功，是何等偉大！他在公理正義上，戰勝那些迫害他，毀謗他的敵人，又是何等輝煌！我們現在知道他的力量，就是從這樣被熬煎蝦鍊和奮鬥犧牲中孳生出來的。（下接二版一欄）</p>

<h3>美國的長期援毆方案</h3>
<p>美國國會究成緊急援外計劃的立法手　之後，已於十九日休曾，將於明年一月六日復會；而杜魯門總統又於國會休會前的一剎那，提出一種長期援歐方案，文長九千餘字，除了說明美國援助歐洲各國復興的宗旨與聯合國憲章的精神完全符合而外，並指出美國援助歐洲各國所附有的條件，杜魯門縱統的道一篇咨文，雖須留待明年國會討論，但其含義重大，實為一九四七年歲末國際政治上的一件大事，英法諸國均已表示熱烈歡迎，實可視為從一九四七年到一九四八年承轉的起點。</p>
<p>美國援助歐洲復典的計劃，是馬微爾國務卿於六月十五日在哈佛大學演議。首先提出的，起初抱着極大的願望，擬將蘇聯也列為受助國之一；但是巴黎會議的結果，不僅蘇聯監決反對美國的援助，而且在蘇聯控制下的若干小國，也拒不接受美國的援助。因此美國的援歐計劃，也就陷於停頓狀態，一直到目前，尙米能具體化；在這五六個月的時問內，我們只看到美國的初步工作，杜魯門總統曾指派三個委員會硏究美國的資源及其援歐的能力，並派哈里受調查歐洲的實際需要，後來哈氏提出報告，主張援歐基金須有一百二十億至一百七十億美元；馬歇爾國務鄉乃依照各方面的估計，於十一月十日宣佈援歐基金須在一百六十億至二百億美元之間。此在歐洲十六國所組織的經濟合作委員會，曾於九月下旬，提出一個報告書，送達美國政府，表示美國若能援助其復興，則歡洲十六國也能做到下列四件事：　努力增加生產；　竭力設法保持國內金融財政的安定；　保證各國盡力不斷合作；　增加對美轍出，如此在四年內，歐洲就能自給自足，不必抑仰求他國援助。</p>
<p>所以，美國援歐的呼邵雖然甚囂塵上，但是遲週未能實現，而西歐各國，尤其是義法輿等國的經濟危機，日見險惡，若不立即予以全面的援助，則經濟的不安必然浩成政治的擾亂，杜魯門總統有鑒於斯，乃決定召開國會特別會議，討論緊急援歐計劃，國會於十一月十六日召開特別會議，杜魯門總統立即以咨文送達國會，要求撥款五億九千七百萬美元，作為緊急援助法，義，奧三國的基金，經過一個月的激烈鄉論，這個緊急援外法案，終於獲得兩院的修正與通過，且已由杜魯門總統簽署成為正式法律，與原案雖有不同，但無重大出入。只是歐洲僅靠了這一個緊急援外法案，仍是無法復興的，因此杜魯門總統便更進一步，提出了這個長期援歐計劃，主張撥款一百五十一億五一百七十億美元，援助歐洲十六個國家，以四年為限，務使歐洲十六國均能復興，從而保證第三次世界大戰永不發生。所以我們不論從那一個角度去觀察，這個長期援歐計劃，對於今後美國政局的發展以及整個世界大局的動向，均將　生非常重大的影響，實在値得我們的重視。</p>
<p>就世界大局而論，美國長期援歐計劃，在表面上，似乎是美國的慷慨為懷，不惜以百億巨款，援助歐洲十六國復興經濟，從而保證第三次大戰不再發生；但是按之實際，却另有作用：第一是穩定西歐的經濟，使歐洲十六個國家在經濟上都熊自給自足，不致再遭遇慣乏的磨折，如此各國就可以保持獨立與完整，不致墜入別國的控制之下。第二是避免美國國內發生經濟恐慌，誰都知道美國經濟繁熒的基礎，完全建立在她的海外市場上，「天下皆貧而美國獨富」是絕對不可能的。歐洲如若發生經濟恐慌，勢必影響及美國的工商業，現在歐洲十六國的經濟已瀕於破產的邊緣，美國若不及時予以援助，挽狂瀾於米倒，則美國經濟恐慌，終有一天要發生。換句話說，美國要避免國內經濟恐慌，就非援助歐洲各國復興不可。所以有人說美國援歐就等於自救，也有相當的理由。</p>
<p>但是今日世界問題的癥結，一言以蔽之，在於美蘇兩國的水火不相容；蘇聯手中唯一的勝牌，乃在期等世界發生經濟恐慌，歐洲一旦發生經濟恐慌，蘇聯的勢力就可乘虛而入，蘇聯的億慕，也就可以繼　西移；美國若因歐洲經濟恐慌而發生不景氣，蘇聯也就不難制勝美國了。反之，在美國方面，憑其目前人力物力，對付蘇聯，固然有餘，但是美國最怕的是經濟恐慌，歐洲經濟若不能復興，根本就無和平可言，更加談不到永久和平。萬一不幸，世界經濟恐慌的巨浪，如若波及美國，則美國又將目　不暇，勢必被迫放棄其領導世界締造和平的責任。所以在今日的美蘇之間，不特已發生「冷戰」，而且所謂「經濟戰」，也已愈演愈烈，雙方爭奪的戰場，就在今日的歐洲。美國要援助歐洲，不讓歐洲發生經濟恐慌；但是蘇聯却要千方百計，橫加阻撓，蘇聯突然在華沙組織新共產國際，其目的就要煽動歐洲各國人民，一致反對美援，使美國的援歐計劃不能實現；蘇聯在這次倫敦外長會議中，又採取不妥協態度，甚至使四國外長不歡而散，其作用也就在阻撓歐洲經濟的統一與復興；再如蘇聯這次改革幣制，也含有加强蘇聯經濟集團的作用。所以美國長期援歐計劃的提出，必然引起蘇聯的反嚮。預料美蘇間的政治門爭更要白熱化了。</p>
<p>再從美國國內政局而言，杜魯門總統提出這個計劃，如能為國會通過，施行有效，不特復興了歐洲的經濟，而且也避免了美國的經濟恐慌，則杜魯門總統的功績，可以與故總統羅斯福等量齊觀，明年總統競選，杜魯門有了這樣一筆的大資本，勝利可操左券了；杜魯門的用意，必為共和黨所洞悉，所以預料至明年一月國會復會後，美國的黨爭必然益趨尖銳化。</p>
<h3>主席聖誕廣播詞　（上接一版）</h3>
<p>在過去的十年內，我們全國同胞嘗盡了戰爭和匪亂的痛苦，認識了國家憂患艱難的眞諦。我們國家受到這樣無法統計的破壞，我們民族受到這樣惡毒無比的毀謗，我們的動機，都被人誤解，我們的生活和行動，甚至被人惡意宣傳虛張到毫無事實的影踪，我們的政府與軍隊官兵，以及公務人員，都被那些破壊統一，不顧國家獨立自由的民族敗類—漢奸共匪等，在國內國外用各種卑劣的宣傳方法，來公開侮辱我們國家，巾傷我們整個民族的人格。</p>
<p>必須付出代價</p>
<p>可是這些不道德不光明的險惡環鏡，並不能使我們有所沮喪。因為我們知道，這種種的侮辱，是我們在建立更偉大與更究美的基督敎義，民有。民治。民享。三民主義新中國的時候，所必須付出的代價。如果沒有這苦痛和黑暗的一面，人生也就無所謂快樂和光明了。我們知道，國家和人民，在這樣慘痛的煎　之中，很到了眞正的提鍊，我們的苦痛，給予我們以新生的活力與經騐，將便我們國家民族克服當前的一切艱難，必能達到勝利的終點。</p>
<p>我們有了這種認識，這種信仰，我們就能望見了歷盡艱苦終獲勝利的耶穌基督，站在我們面前，做指引我們國家的明燈，鼓勵我們的新生。</p>
<p>中國及世界各地的基督徒，眼看了戰後全體人類都在普遍的失望與道德墮落的浪潮裘旋轉，大家都覺得非常沉悶悲觀。在往日，戰爭苦難的時期，人們因為理想着一個更完美的世界，猶能　續支撐，奮鬥到底，而到了現在，人們到處都在疑問着在這個依然充滿着戰爭利征服忍想的世界中，我們能够作些什麽工作，來確保人類幸福和世界的和平，來實現我們固有的理想呢？</p>
<p>當代中心問題</p>
<p>基督徒對於這個當代的中心問題，應該有一個回答。</p>
<p>我想這個答案，可以在人類的心性中尋求出來。人們往往因為理想沒有達到，而變成失望，這是由於人格經不起歷史的磨鍊的緣故，所以往往將從前所犯的同樣錯誤，再度發生，過去同樣的罪惡，也變本加厲的重新出現，人們似乎被注定了在卑污自私的漩渦之中，永遠沉淪，而無法超脫，我們有沒有超脫這種不幸命運的方法呢？我可以肯定的回答說：「當然是有的」。基督敎指示我們一條途徑，基督敎相信人性必能改善，這個信心，就是人類希望未來的指針，亦就是世界的轉變必須從人心的改善做起，假使我們有更良好的人生，自然也會有更美滿的世界。我們如果因為罪惡的威脅，和罪　在人世間的橫行，就不自振作，逐漸變為精神萎靡，心身麻痺，以至於自暴自葉，那便是對人生缺乏信仰心的緣故，而這種信仰心，正是耶穌基督給我們最大的敎訓，亦就是最大的力量，這實在是我們克服一切罪惡主要的活力。耶穌　督說：「你們只要有如芥子一樣的信心，你們的力量就可移山倒海」。當今的世界人類，正在苦痛與罪惡的壓力之下，竭力掙扎，世人就十分需要這種信仰，而恥穌基督就是把道種信仰帶給我們徬徨與悲觀的世界，來拯救我們人類的苦痛。</p>
<p>新生機運肇始</p>
<p>當我想到今年耶穌聖誕節的時候，我就想念到我們中國在這個令節的一天，就要開始實施民主新憲法了，這個紀念，我認為是十分竇貴的。中華民國卅六年，就是耶穌降生一九四七年的聖誕節，將是我們中華民國和全體人民統一獨立，平等自由，新生機運　始的一天，我們新憲法的特點，就是它保證要把基督敎理的基本要素，即個人的　嚴吳自由，普遍的給予我們全國的同胞，這個新憲法，確認了全國國民的各種自由權利，它在國家統一與自由下，於一個自由人民的精神中孕育誕生。</p>
<p>我們認為新憲法的實施，祇是完成我們建設新中國的最後目標的初步，但這對我們中國三千年來專制政體和封建社會，是一個劃時代的進步，我願我們全國同胞憑着信仰和虔誠，共同一致，努力前進，我相信一定很快的能够完成我們所預定的路程，就是建立我們三民主義新中國的完成。</p>
<p>這便是今年耶穌聖誕節我對於我們全國同胞和世界人士所要貢獻和希望的一點。（完）</p>

<h3>殺人競賽三戰犯　向井·野田·田中　判決書全文</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南京大屠殺中殺人競賽案之日戰犯向井敏明，野出巖，田中軍吉三人，本月十八日純國防部審制戰犯軍事法庭判決各處死刑，其判決書全文如次：國防部審判戰犯軍事法庭判決，被告向井敏明男，年三十六歲，日本山口縣人，砲兵小隊長。野田巖（即野田毅）年三十五歲，日本鹿兒島人，日軍第十六師團富山大隊副官。田中軍吉男，年四十三歲，日本東京人，日軍第六師團第四十五聯隊中隊長。</p>
<p>右被告等，因戰犯案件，經本庭檢察官起訴，本庭判決如左：</p>
<p>主文</p>
<p>向井敏明，野田嚴，田中軍吉，在作戰期間，共同　讀署殺俘　及非戰鬥人員，各處死刑。</p>
<p>事實</p>
<p>向并敏明，野田巖，在作戰期間，隸麗日軍第十六師團中島部隊，分充少尉小隊長及副官。田中軍吉隸屬第六師團谷壽夫部隊，充任大尉中隊長。於民國二十六年十二月會攻南京之役，因遭遇我軍監强抵抗，銜恨之餘，乃作有計劃之屠殺，藉以洩憤。田中軍吉在在京城西南郊一帶，以「助廣」賓劍，連殺俘虜及非戰鬥人員達三百餘名。向井敏明，野田巖則在紫金山麓，以殺人多寡為競賽娛樂，各揮利刃，不擇老幼，逢人砍殺，結果野田巖戳斃百零五人，向井敏明則以殺百零六人獲勝。日本投降後，野田巖等先後在東京被盟軍總司令部緝獲，經我駐日代表團解送來京，由本庭檢察官偵查起訴。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>查本案被告向井敏明及野田巖，於會攻南京之役，，在紫金山麓以屠殺俘虜及非戰鬥人員為競賽娛樂，結果野田巖共殺百零五人，向井敏明則以殺百零六人獲勝之事實，匯特在當時留京外籍記者田伯烈所著「日軍暴行紀實內已有詳明記戲，即核與遠東國際軍事法庭中國檢察官辦事處搜獲之當時「東京日日新聞」所戰，該被告等如何在紫金山　作「斬殺百人」之競賽，如何於完成屠殺超越紀錄後，各舉血刀，含笑相向，談論勝負各情，亦相脗合，並有該被告等分執兇刀藉以炫耀武功之合攝照片，標載「百人斬競爭之兩將校」等字樣，可資佐證。再參以南京大屠殺案已決犯谷壽夫之確定判決所載，日軍分竄城內外，展開大規模屠殺，其中有殺人比賽一節，即係本件被告向井敏明及野田巖之罪行。是時我被伴軍民遭集體殺戮及焚屍滅跡者，達十九萬人以上，被零星殘殺，屍骸經慈善團掩埋者，達十五萬人以上，均為該確定判決根據確切證據所認定之事實，幷經本庭在　葬地點，起出屍骸頭頗數千吳為憑，綜上參互以觀，則被告向井敏明及野田巖，係南京大屠殺案之共犯，實屬豪無疑義。乃該被吿等自知無可　飾，竟謂「東京日日新聞」係　偽登載，專為被告頌揚武功，以博日本女界之茨　，期能早日獲得佳偶云云。然查在作戰期間，日軍當局對於軍事新聞之統制檢查，本極注意，而「東京日日新聞」係日本重要刋物，如果該被告等幷無此項殺人競賽之事實，絕無故為虛構，以巨火篇輻專為該被告等宣傳之理，况該項新聞之登載，旣經本庭引用上開各項確切證據予以證實，即非通常　閱者可比，自得據為判決之基礎，並謂以殺人為競賽之兇殘獸行，可作徵婚廣告，以博女性歡心，更為現代人類史上所未前聞，其抗辯各節，均屬無可採取。次查被吿田中軍吉。係已決犯谷壽夫之直隸部屬，在谷壽夫攻陷京城，實施屠殺時，曾携「助廣」軍刀參與，巳為該被告所自承之事實，而敵酋谷壽夫等，常時率部在我首都作慘絕　寰之屠殺，歷時十餘日，遭戮者三十餘萬衆，匪特有本庭三十六年度審字第一號確定判決可據，且為舉世共聞之事實，被告田中軍吉旣居於谷壽夫直隷部屬之地位，持刀參與，且在混亂斬殺中，我彼俘軍民死於該被告所携之「助廣」軍刀下者，逾三百人，此有日本軍官山中學太郎所編「皇兵」一　，刋登該被告之軍刀照片，標載「曾斬三百人之隊長（指田中軍吉）愛刀助廣」等字樣可稽，幷有該被告親自揮刀斬殺平民之照片獲案，可資印證，其係南京大陽殺案中實施殺人共犯之一，亦無可疑，雖據辯糊，照片所攝伊本人係穿襯衫顯在夏令，而攻陷南京係在冬天，可見該照片僅能證明伊在另一地方斬設一人等話，然勿論在揮刀　力猛斬之頃，為便利動作，縱在冬令，脫卸外衣，本屬常事，已不容斤斤執此，希圖避就，且其參與南京大屠殺之事實，已屬衆證確鑿，有如上述，更容藉端狡展之餘地。按被告等連續屠殺俘虜及非戰鬥人員，係這反海牙陸戰規例，及戰時俘虜待遇公約，應構成戰爭罪及遼反人道罪，其以屠戮平民，認為武功，並以殺人作競賽娛樂，可謂窮兇極悲，發悍無與倫比，實為人類蟊賊，文明公敵，非予書法嚴懲，將何以肅紀綱而維世道，爰各科處極刑，以照炯戒。</p>
<p>據上論結，應依刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段海牙陸戰規例第四條第二項第二十三條第三款，第四十六絛第一項，戰時俘虜待　公約第二條，第三條，戰爭罪犯審判條例第一條，第二條第二款，第三條第一款，第十一條，刑法第二十八條，第五十六條前段，第五十七條，判決如主文。</p>

<h3>法內長莫許發出敬告　歐陸危機仍潛伏　愼防國際共產春季攻勢</h3>
<p>〔路　社倫敦廿一日電〕英工黨領袖預料在春季以前，共黨將在西歐發動罷工攻勢，而英國屆時亦將受其騷動。歐陸傳來之報告，顯示共黨擾亂法國經濟之計劃，並未被完全擊潰，至於在義大利之嚴重鬥爭，則根本尙未展開。一般印象乃為共黨在義工會中之實力，較在法國更為堅强，惟迄至目前為止，尙朱全面施展耳。共黨領抽固已表示，最近法國之總罷工，給予法國經濟之打擊，具有長久之效果，雖有美國給予之臨時援助，仍將便工人於三個月後，得以重新提出工資問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿一日電〕法新任內長莫許今單獨會見合衆社記者，就上月　大利法國會境發生之流血能工及動亂稱，「顯此乃國際性」致反對馬　爾計劃之攻勢之一部。歐洲共黨聽從共產新聞局之命令，發動不法行為，以破壞各該國之經濟及正常生活，俾在馬歇爾計劃實施之時，該計劃將全然無效。木人堅決相信，法國最近之困難並非內戰之試探，而為下次內戰之總彩排。籍此次衡突，共黨得以訓練其隊伍。如北部及馬賽之突繫隊等，共黨曾奉嚴峻命令，只能使用石塊及鐵捧，不得使用軍器，故此乃軍事行動。莫氏繼稱，法政府已獲悉法共與共新局及義共一致即將推行之計劃。法共確信民主之法國政府無法採取强硬迅捷之行動，應付此舉，法共預料法政府非垮台即答應罷工者之要求　」莫許又稱，法共失敗之理由有三：第一，法政府在全國及議會中採取迅雷不及掩耳而强有力之行動，議會不得不通過阻遏破壞之特殊法案。第二，工界程度極高，不再唯共黨之馬首是瞻。第三，勞工部長始終不關閉與總工會談判之門。莫許相信法共必將捲土重來，明年二三月間菜蔬肉價特昂之時，可能爆發更多之暴動。</p>
<h3>法願隨時與佔領國談判　謀解決德國問題　法議會辯論財政新方案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿一日電〕外長皮杜爾今日在國會外交委員會閉幕會議宣稱，法國隨時願與其他佔領國就德國前途進行談判，　可獲得有益解決，但吾人行動完全自由，一般立場與目標將保持不變。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿一日電〕國民議會今日開始辯論財長梅逸所提出之開源節流方案，共黨議員發表嚴重之抨攣，共黨議員勒革斥為剝削勞工階級之制度，並向梅逸厲聲　責「汝之願意博取美國銀行巨頭之信任更在法國民衆之信任之上。」另一共黨議員克洛亞薩謂此一計劃必定行不通，蓋壓制性之措施，決不能獲得廣大支持。</p>
<h3>蘇聯艦隊　實力增强</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓二十日電〕美海軍部出版之刋物謂，蘇艦隊急遽增長，但指出蘇聯握有之船艦頗多陳舊者。海軍部之官方雜誌謂，蘇聯艦隊由此次大戰而實力已較前增强。據稱，所獲得之情報，表明蘇聯有波羅的海。黑海。及太平洋等四大艦隊，與夫裏海及內部大河中之小型艦隊。又稱，蘇聯近年已開始計劃自造戰艦，並自盟國及戰敗之敵國獲得船艦。蘇聯已有潛艇艦隊，其中並有在戰事結束時經與英美訂立協定自德國取得之髙速度型潛艇。據稱，蘇聯已在遠東之海參崴建造船隻及巨型驅逐艦。</p>
<h3>議艦分配蘇法</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬二十日電〕四强海軍委員會已向義政府提出義國根據和約必須交給蘇聯及法國之各軍艦之名單。按對議和約規定義大利應交給四强軍艦三十艘，包括各三萬五千噸之主力艦義大利號及維多利亞凡尼多號，及一萬三千噸之主力艦凱撒號。英美巳宣布放棄其應得部份，惟此等放棄部份應予拆毀，不得作為義海軍之一部。</p>
<h3>美義首長　交換電文</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓二十日電〕義總理加斯貝利於駐義末批美軍於本月十五日撤出義國之日，曾電杜魯門總統略謂，「値茲全部盟軍退出義境之日，敝人謹向閣下保護義國人民之將永矢勿忘盟軍解放義國之行動，及與議軍駢肩作戰之精神。」</p>
<p>杜魯門總統覆電有云：「敝人深知義政府及人民決維護其獲得之自由，敝國人民於獲悉議大利正與世界其他愛好和平之國，共同保衛自由及民主時，衷心莫不欣慰。」</p>
<h3>東西列強明爭暗鬥　今後趨勢堪注目　傳蘇外長遭史達林申斥</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿一日電〕倫郭「人民報」外交記者報告，莫洛托夫歸國後，史達林召集政治局特別會議，對莫氏未能避免四强倫敦會議之破裂，大事申斥，史氏並堅決要求徹查失敗之原因。會議中其他蘇聯高級官員對莫氏之舉措？亦批評備至。該報記者測稱，由於此項發展，蘇聯下次與西方國家會晤時，可能在外交上稍趨和好。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕諸强關係之徘徊十字街口，至今日巳到達戰爭結束以來最明顯之程度，然今後之發展尙在令人揣測之階段，自倫敦外長會失敗後，美國或蘇聯均未透露其下一行動之意向。今日之問題乃為決定將　續嘗試以保持盟國合作之基構，抑向世界宣布合作之失敗，今後之發展當視兩對立制度公開鬥爭之結果而定。僅莫斯科及華盛頓之決策者，已知被等是否已準備放棄盟國之共同目標。外界人士在四强之一採取外交上之主動步驟以前，尙無從獲得任何指示。貝文及皮杜爾在倫數發表之談話，顯示在新年以前，倫敦或巴黎當不致採取此稱主動步驟。討論奧國問題之外長代表，定於二月一日以前開會，聆取蘇聯最近之建議。果四强尙有一個月之時問，可以從事三思，吾人試以現存之國際協定作出發點，可發見下列諸點之可能性：　諸强中之任何一强，不致採取正式步驟以結束或代替外長會織機構，然西方國家或蘇聯是不致因此而不能在其佔領區內發展現行之制度。　三西方强國關於調協德國西部三區政策之討論，將不得外長會議未來任務決定而舉行，於此三強討論之方式及參加討論之人選，均具人重大意義，蓋蘇聯之反對，勢必根據此項方式及水準而　具方針。　四強之一將採取主動，以要求結東外長會議。　諸強之得就和約基礎成立協議，旣已面臨破產，一強或數強可能決定向更高當局，若聯合國機構，提出此一整個事件。　英美蘇三強之一援用雅爾達協定，召開三強會議，使諸強關係得在外長會議以外，重被導入正軌，就以上諸點觀，第一二兩項至少在最近的將來，比較最為可能。</p>
<h3>英國名流發出呼籲　三巨頭應舉行會商　樹立原子能管制避免慘禍</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫敦二十日電〕英國知名之士十人今日發表聯合宣言，癱請艾德禮首相與杜魯門總統，設法令史達林正視四外長倫敦會議破裂後所引起之國際緊張局勢。宣言簽名者有自由黨之國會類員李德。名哲學家羅素勛爵，名敎育家與詩人伊里奧特。聖保羅敎堂牧師馬修士。前外務部顧問文西泰勛爵·　工黨國會議員四人。宣言對甚多國家共產主義勢力之不斷增長，甚表憂慮，並認為各盟國經過六年大戰，推翻一種極權主義形式後，僅又換得另一種較法西斯主義猶為强悍之極權主義形式，誠屬可悲。宣言於强調原子戰爭之威脅時，以所有管制原子能企圖之失敗，歸咎於「蘇聯之頑強態度」。宣言建議艾德禮與杜魯門應向史達林指陳明白原子戰爭須予避免。宣言復稱，如此種强有力之調停竟告失敗，則「各愛好自由國家應與英美密切聯繫，一致行動，發展一種超越之防衛力量，包括原子力量在內，使任何強國皆不敢向渠等挑釁」。</p>
<h3>義新憲法　元旦實施</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬　一日電〕此間新憲法，定於一月一日起施行，最後批準。美共和國第一屆國會之選舉，可望於明年四月問舉行。憲法規定國會設參衆兩院，參議院議員二〇八人，任期六年，衆議院議員六〇〇人，任期五年。憲法宣布義大利為民主共和國，保陣工人罷工之權利及假期工資之照給，與敎廷所締之拉特倫條約亦訂入新憲之內，同時並禁止對任何宗敎實施限制，新憲並規定人民對法律有複決之權。若干區應實行地方自治，棄絕戰爭之為侵略工具，禁止法西斯黨之復活。</p>
<h3>蘇在德境佔區　星光照耀鞏固地位　反對黨領袖遭罷黜</h3>
<p>〔聯合社柏林二十日電〕蘇聯軍事當局今夜迅速行動，鞏固其在德國佔領區之地位，以防倫敦四外長會議失敗後所可發生之任何事變。蘇佔領區基督民主黨領袖兩人已被罷黜，該黨在蘇佔領區為名義上的反對黨，該然柏林機關報「新日報」主筆亦被撤換。</p>
<h3>歐洲十六國經濟會議　明年初計劃重開　拉福萊德傳將任援歐方案總裁</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕此間觀察家相信，默洲十六國之經濟會議，將於明年初重開，以根據杜魯門總統向國會提出之援歐方案，而考慮歐洲之行動計劃。觀察家相信，歐洲十六國此舉，將為西方民主國對於本屆倫敦外畏會議之破裂最具體之答覆。</p>
<p>美國會人士亦感覺令國會最感興售者，即為自歐洲傳來歐洲國家，業巳開始行動，以廢止貿易壁壘，並就工業生產成立協議之報告。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿一日電〕此問盛傳前威斯康辛州參議員拉福萊來德，可望被任為馬歇爾援歐方案之總裁，拉氏接見本社記者時，雖拒絕討論出任此職之可能性，但强調渠乃援歐計劃起草時之幕後主要人物，且完全贊成杜魯門向國會建議之方案管觀方式。拉福萊德現年五十一歲，乃哈里曼委員會之委員，與共和黨關係密切，故可望獲得國會之支持。</p>

<h3>食糧不足燃料缺乏　歐洲消度圣誕節　敎宗發表聖誕詔書呼籲和平</h3>
<p>〔聯合社梵諦岡廿一日電〕敎宗庇護十二世耶誕夜演說，定於標準時間九時五十五分由梵諦岡電台先用義大利語向全世界廣播，然後譯成英，德，法，波蘭，西班牙，匈牙利，何籣及葡萄牙等國語言分別廣播。</p>
<p>〔聯合社梵諦岡敎廷廿日電〕敎宗庇護十二世今日發表聖誕詔書，題為「最企求之和平」，呼籲天主敎徒須為全世界祈禱和平，詔書中以痛切之詞，斥責一輩掀起人類自相叛亂之煽動者。並稱階級仇視有破壞及傾覆各國根本基礎之勢。此言顯指共產黨及義大利而言。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿日電〕歐洲十三個國家之人民將消度一九三九年來比較豐裕的聖誕佳節。另有九國之人民將過八年來最簡約之節日，但聖誕之歡樂則各國皆同，略述情形如下：「英國：」英國人可多購鮮肉六辨士，等於半皇期之配給量。假期間食糖之配給幾乎加倍，糖果之配給加倍。商店中禮品加多，價格較高。主要均實施配給，燃料供給亦較充足。「法國，」巴黎和平大街兩旁各商店，備有豪侈之禮物。價格約漲百分之五十。糧食供應稀少。每日麵包配給量已减至二十公分，約三小片。燃料缺乏，法國需添建住宅一百萬所，但建築材料缺乏。「德國：」大多數柏林市民的聖誕大菜將為番薯湯，及每十日不足一磅配給量所剩下之鮮肉或靑魚。六歲至廿歲之人，外加食糖一磅。美軍佔領區每個德國兒童，可獲得聖誕糖果，糕餅與特種食物配給。「義大利：」美國正以毅物與燃料參濟義國，商店消費品充足，燃料則稀少而昻貴。「奧地利：」食物恐慌嚴重，房屋稀少，燃料供給嚴重。「比利時：」商店充滿食物。煤斤之配給量為五百磅，綽乎有餘。「丹麥：」食物　富。聖誕糖果較缺。「南斯拉夫：」食物較充分。住居問題嚴重，燃料不患缺乏。聖誕大菜有烤豬肉及糖果。「捷克：」京城各商店橱窗中充滿玩具，食物店院滿貨物聖誕禮物亦多，燃料則缺乏。「瑞典：」主要物品雖實施配給，但黑市食物極多。「荷蘭：」肉類之配給已加倍，每星期為四百公分。</p>

<h3>被控貪汚之李卓敏等九人　不起訴處分理由　縱有未合之處亦屬行政上問題　偵查結果認為犯罪嫌疑均不足</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總副署長李　敏等被控貪汚案，經地檢處偵查後，候謁昌，　承道。胡可時等十二被吿經提起公訴，李卓　，陸陸翰芹，徐世長，陳廣沅，汪伏生等九人不起訴，起訴理由巳　本報，至李等不起訴之理由，當亦為社會人士所主意，茲探錄其不起訴處分書原文於後：</p>
<p>被吿行總副署長李卓敏。主任秘書陸翰芹，前總務處長徐世長，儲運　廳長陳廣沅，分配應應長汪伏生。分配廳三科科長黃蔚靑，專門委員兼科長張子惠。分配廳專員李桓。物資購銷處科長彭無荒。右開被吿因貪汚嫌一案，經貞查終結，認為應不起訴。　將理由分述如左：</p>
<p>關於李卓敏部份</p>
<p>查該被告被控貪汚嫌疑四點中之　點，關於行總救濟物資之購銷，運輸及分配業務，向由署內各主管單位分別辦理，並由執行長負責監督，被告所任副署長職務，僅係襄助署長辦理署內行政事務，已有被告所提之行總三十五年浦秘字第四五〇號代電，及行總機構調整辦法可稽，被告對於上項業務，旣非全管監督，縱各該主管人員或有這法行為，當非被告所能盡悉，其關於此點所辯不負共同及縱容責任，尙非無據。其被控之　點，關於隱沒敵產電氣冰箱部份，亦有被告提出善後救濟總暑於三十五年一月十六日立與中央信託局地產處之保管據第五頁照片，經核明該照片內確有關於電氣冰箱一具之記載，則被告辯稱無隱沒敵產之可能，亦堪採信。雖被告對於借用之敵偽傢具，不令保管人員加貼接收機關標誌，意圖美觀，固有不合，然比侮另一問題，尙雖據以認為有侵占罪嫌。</p>
<p>其被控　點，關於令行總人事室生任李榮先報銷出差費用，有紊亂糸統舞弊嫌疑一節，查被告於三十六年五。六月內出差國內各地視察，共五次，其出差費用，每次數十萬元，其數字尙不甚大，已由江蘇監察使署派員查明，有原糾舉嘗及所附抄件可查。至其每次出差費用，均由李榮晃經手報銷，則因該李榮先參加視察團出發視察時，担任該團幹事所致，與原任行總職務並無關係，業據被告提出工作團視察分署團員名單五紙及李榮晃經辦工作國事務報告，暨有關卷件，經查核無異。被告辯稱：無干與總務及紊亂糸統舞　　事，自屬信而有徵。至其被控　點，關於劉淸於違法升級部份，查該劉淸於原任行總專員，每月支薪三百元，因工作勤勞，於三十五年年終考績時，提升秘書，每月支薪四百元，係經行總署長霍實樹核准，亦有該署關於劉淸於於三十五年年終考績證件照片可稽。劉淸於之升級或有未合，亦係行政上問題，究難使被告負刑事罪責。綜上所述，被告犯罪嫌疑顯屬不足。　關於</p>
<p>陸翰芹　部份：查被告係行政院善後救濟總署主任秘書，因初到滬上，該署無職員宿舍供給住宿，經暑長特准於其眷屬到滬後，暫住旅舍。計自三十六年二月五日起至九月五日止，開國際飯店第九〇一號房間，共用法幣八千五百二十六萬四千三百二十元，及被告於五，六月間因租用房屋，簽由總務處轉請署長核准，先後撥付房屋修理費，及上手房客遷讓費，共法幣七千萬元，均由該署總務處簽准後，由財務應支付，並未由彼告經手，均經先後調閱該署有關卷宗及票據查明屬實。該被告所用款項，旣經由該署長核准，而由財務應依法支付，雖其支用或有濫費，係屬另一問題，其被控藉端圖利嫌疑，自屬不足。　關於</p>
<p>徐世長　部份：查初吿係行政院善後救　總署專門委員兼總務處處長，被人舉發切用白報紙舞弊，經訊據被告供稱：「白報紙係美軍剩餘物資，尺寸早經裁好，並無大尺寸之紙張（即大的紙張），僅有自打字紙，必須裁小使用，計收到白打字紙三百五十五令，發出一百七十令，付切八十五令，尙有一百令，付切部份，每張切為八英寸寬十英寸半長者（即一張裁四張），切成十萬張，切為八英寸寬十三英寸長者，（即一張裁三張）切成五萬張，因兩種所裁的尺寸不同，故裁後所得到的平方英寸當然不同，不能互相比較，况裁剩之紙脚極小，不能使用，且依習慣，此種紙脚均歸裁紙工人所得」等語。查所稱收付白打字紙數目，經調閱有關賬冊查核無異。（中略）被告辯稱，於切用白打字紙並無舞弊情事，尙堪採信。　關於</p>
<p>陳廣沅　部份：查被吿係行政院善後救濟總署儲運廳廳長兼上海偳運局局長（中略）查上海儲運局於三十五年六月八日與聯合運輸行訂定管理船隻之承攬契約，係在被告於三十五年九月問就該局兼局長之前，且被告於接事後，發現該運輸行管理不善，而改由九通公司承攬管理，已調取該局有關卷宗查核屬實。該九通公司係於三十年五月十四日成立，設於　池路一一九號四樓六六室。復興運輸行則係於三十四年九月底成立，設於中山東二路三號二樓二一〇室，經訊據各該公司行號負責人白旭初·康景福·黃全貴結證述明，並調取其登記證及營業執照查核無異。被告辯稱，非虛設字號，獨攪生意，尙非無據。至該局先後拋棄腐爛物廣，在三十六年九月以前（即本案發生前）者，共三千四百八十噸，於本年十月以後者，約三百噸，均經由聯合國善後救濟總署派專家鑑定代表簽字，並派員會同押往吳淞拋入黃浦江，亦經調取該局沉沒物資卷宗查核非虛，被告辯稱：無乘機侵佔物資情事，亦堪採信。　關於</p>
<p>汪伏生　黃蔚靑　張子惠　李桓部份：查被告汪伏生係行政院藝後救濟總署分配廳應長，被告黃蔚靑，張子惠，均係該廳科長，被告李桓則為該聰專員，辦理物資之分配，係照行總聯總聯合配銷委員會與其附屬各小組審查委員會之決議，不能自由支配，已據提出各該委員會會議紀錄可查。所有庫存物資　數，及被分配人提貨實數，均另由上海儲還局及倉庫設有專人負責，縱物資數目或有不符，及管理物資人員有串同舞弊嫌疑，自與分配無關。雖被吿汪伏生等未待物資實數查明，而僅據聯合委員會　面通知之假定數，遽行分配，因而發生重複問題，固有未合，然此係屬行政問題，固難論以刑責。至被告李桓於受調查電風扇發售及分配數目情形時，諉稱分配電風扇係由各單位辦理，所有會議錄及分配單，均由經辦人員分別保管，不即時設法檢齊備核，易滋誤會，亦有未合。惟旣據隨後檢送江蘇監察使署查核後發還，並在本院偵查時提經查辦無異，尙難據以認定被告汪伏生等隱瞞公文，帮同侵佔嫌疑。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕同濟大學學生為擴大進行勸募寒衣救濟難民工作，前日正式成立「同濟大學捐募塞衣遝動委員會。昨日星期，三百餘學生於淸晨八時，即出動工作，每五人一小組，分頭向虹口區一帶居民勸募寒衣。自長至晚，收獲極多，共計募得棉被六十餘條，寒衣二千餘件，內有舊西裝「傑克」之類，另有鞋子五十餘雙，襪子圍巾等二三百件。勸募隊，原以勸募寒衣為限，但有甚多居民，因無舊衣捐輪，相率捐獻現金，一日間亦募得六百餘萬元。該會準備將此款向舊衣舖購買舊衣後，運同募得寒衣，於今日下午一時出發至虹口閘北一帶分發難民，一面對勸募工作，仍將繼繼續進行。據出動勸募之學生表示：捐輸舊衣或現款者，多為中下級家庭一般上等家庭，則反多誤解，甚或以白眼相加，致使工作進行，困難甚多。該會甚盼此項工作能獲得社會廣大同情，踴躍捐贈，嘉惠孤苦難民，當匪淺尠也。</p>

<h3>耶誕節近商店蕭條　火鷄身價百萬　哀鴻到處啼號</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聖誕節即將來臨，市上應時之聖誕禮物紛然雜陳。火鷄因受輸入限制，多賴浙省定海附近所產點綴供應，致價格奇易，每磅售價十二萬元，一隻需百餘萬，聖誕樹每株由二十萬至一百萬左右，銀鈴，燭炬，及聖誕花籃等亦非數百萬不能完成富鹿商皇之裝置。故除較大商店外，樹窗中均甚見蕭條。間有數家商店以聖誕老人作窗飾廣告者，其布袋中悉為該店經售或出產之商品。使徘徊街頭企待聖誕恩物之兒童徒興嗟嘆而已。各敎堂除定於耶誕日上午按例舉行祈禱儀式外，因物價過髙，似往年召集盛會分發糖菓衣物等之豪舉，恐將不復再有。至南京西路及林森中路一帶出售聖誕禮物之交易亦極為寥落，製售巨型聖誕蛋糕者僅沙利文一家，作西式二樓花園建築式樣，雖瑰麗逾恒，而截至今日止，猶無人問津。</p>
<p>街頭出售聖誕樹，一顧客駐足選購。　（本報攝）</p>
<p>禮品價格漲十五倍</p>
<p>依據永安公司統計，耶誕前一週內該公司出售耶誕禮物之門市，戰前每日平均可售發票一千二百張，而目前祗有三百五十張左右。禮物價格較戰前漲起十五倍，此為交易冷落之主因。今年因進出口貿易發達，外僑多携眷在滬成立家庭。最近留滬之美軍亦均迎眷來此，故聖誕禮物之購主，十分之六七均為彼等。今年聖誕玩具較往年特異者，即外貨來源斷絕，所有玩其皆係國產廠商製造。去歲風　一時之吉普車玩具已成過去，代之而起者為大型三輸軍玩具，外僑中特喜競購，以航郵寄贈本國親友，作為旅居中唯一具有紀念性之聖誕禮物。各舞應因耶誕夜延長營業時間之申請尙未奉局核准，故情緒未見熱烈。惟五光十色之紙帽，面具。花飾等化裝用具，已在趕製中。茶資並已定為平時之一倍，約十四萬至十八萬元一杯。屆時恐狂歡場面仍不能免。</p>

<p>私人舞會將見增多</p>
<p>今年因各　樓筵席受節約限制。私人多擬在家邀集親友，於聖誕夜舉行大規模之　集舞會，歡樂通靑。故預料今年私人舞會將較去年為盛。又新疆歌舞團此次將在滬渡比佳節，彼等對此富有宗敎意味之師日，極感興趣，為示與上海市民及留滬外僑共賀佳節起見，取可能擇一廣場獻演邊弧歌舞。惟近日寒流瀰漫，零下五度之街頭，難民啼飢號寒，露屍有增無减，與商店櫥窗中以棉絮銀花裝成之雪景相掩映，實令人根觸無已。</p>

<h3>中美聯姻佳話　飛虎將軍女記者　有情人終成眷屬　陳納德與陳香梅在滬舉行婚禮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前美十四航空大隊飛虎將軍陳納德（見圖），於昨日下午在本市虹橋路私邸與中央通訊社記者陳香梅女士（見圖）舉行結婚典禮，由毛頓生牧師證婚。此事外界知者甚少，即雙方平時友好事先亦無所聞。茲悉，昨日參加陳將軍與陳女士婚禮之來賓有十二人，新娘由其父入禮堂，新娘之繼母及外交部次長葉公超等亦均在場。男嬪相為前飛虎隊飛行負琴屈萊上校，女婦相則為新娘之姊雪茜亞女士。聞新人於婚後，將仍留滬上。</p>
<p>陳納德將軍現年五十七歲，為全世界最聞名之轟炸飛行專家。我國抗戰軍興，陳氏應聘來華，任蔣主席空軍顧問。旋即以美志願航空員組織飛虎隊，在中國西南諸省作戰，屢建奇功，被譽為「中國之友」及太平洋戰爭爆發，美正式對日宣戰，即將飛虎隊改組為十四航空大隊，歸陳氏統率。最近並受美海軍勳章。陳將軍現為行總空運大隊主持人。陳女士籍廣東，現年廿四歲。抗戰時即在昆明入中央通訊社任記者。渠與陳將軍相識，即在滇為記者時開始。戰後，陳女士被調派米滬，其採訪技能，早為各界所贊許。女士之父前任我國駐舊金山領事，最近始由美返華，現調任駐婆羅洲薩刺瓦克領事，即將前往履新。按陳將軍與陳女士互矢愛好，外界會早有傳聞，雖經女士再三否認，但一般友好却預料其好事之近矣。今果實行中美聯姻，誠佳話也。</p>
<h3>夜航燈光設備　新自美國運到　耶誕節起　可以放光</h3>

<h3>確保中原</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日訊〕朔風凜冽，天寒　凍，北方冰天雪地里的戰鬥對於在京滬的人們　該是一件不可想像的事。但是北方的寒冷會　到南邊來，北方的苦難消息在這氣溫已到零下的歲尾，也足使京畿動心。新近從開對飛到首都來請願的河南請願　在二十日上午痛訴了許多事情，省參議會副議長張鴻烈老先生和幾位代表極不願危言聳聽，但事實的嚴重性促使他們非　光請願不可。</p>
<p>匪部三求</p>
<p>當黃河從故道經山東入海以後，山東的軍事有急轉直下的進展，陳毅和劉伯承兩匪部原都一拉桿過河，想在河北生根，但他們很快發現，在他們幾年鬥爭統治之下，河北的農村經濟基礎，已不能負載這數十萬兵員。行之有素的「參軍運動」旣不能使河北平原再供給兵源，衣食的欠缺更使過冬都發生因難，於是幾十萬兵馬夥同陳　匪分由東西兩路呼嘯而下，高唱以空心戰術展開「三求運動」，求衣，求食，求兵，最後耍在伏牛山和大別山生根。不料在豫鄂交界和宛西兩地區的失利，企圖失敗，一轉鋒便直逼了中原的心臟。</p>
<p>豫省喫緊</p>
<p>「河南遍地緊張，尤其是開封。鄭州·許昌這三角地帶，陳　·陳毅。劉伯承三部匯軍都指向這里。這里是河南的中心，是平漢隴海兩路的樞紐，得失可以影嚮整個局勢。同時這里又是河南黨政軍幹部的集中地，萬一遭受損失，對河南前途更不堪設想。所以無論就戰略地理或人材保全來說，這地區的價値實在難以估計，政府應該以大軍增援解圍，並且如果一舉能把這三部共匪的主力消滅，關內的澄淸也必不遠。現在，河南不僅是軍事吃緊，本來已經存在的災情也受到嚴重影響，糧食和賑款也需要得很迫切。我們代表三千的老百姓，央求全國的人認識中原的重要，懇請政府和社會全力救援。」</p>
<p>中原疾苦</p>
<p>以上都是張老先生的話。接着，每個人都提出中原的歷史上的衝要地位，每個人都痛訴中原近年來的疾苦</p>
<p>「黃河以南，從　關洛陽以迄鄭汴商邱，自古以來是屏障南中國的第一綫，保衛這些據點，關係全局，我們不祇是為桑梓呼　，我們是為全局請命。」</p>
<p>「從來中原決定大局，中原不保，武漢京滬即無保障，隴海平漢不保，津浦萬難確守。我們決不是危言　聰，是史實和形勢證明這種論斷。」</p>
<p>注意不夠</p>
<p>河南在抗戰期間，出丁出糧，保家鄉，衛國土，盡了最大的力。但，此刻誰敢說大家對中原的注意是够了呢？他們認為：如今事急矣，不過如有三師之衆，中原可以由點綫的確保，可以緩圖大局的恢復。否則過了半年，以這個糧丁素豐地區，運用三十師雄兵，怕也難得恢復。他們呼籲儘速以大軍·糧食·賑款·物資·救災保土。（記者濮德玠）</p>

<h3>本市商業金融界人士　檢討抽緊銀根影響　行局差入雖鉅物價未比例下降　收朿銀根應勿使生產資金凍結</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市若干商業金融界人士，頃就當局抽緊銀根，國家行局連日鉅　美入，對一般工商物價之影響，發表意見如次。渠等認為目前一般商業行莊，夜已失去其為工商金融調劑之有力機構。而一般商業行莊之存款，又多過而不留。故當局如欲控制物價，收縮銀根，商業行莊實巳非對象。再者過去當局常過份重視國家行局貨款之效能，實則國家行局之貨款，大多須經二三個月之審核通過時間，而貸款又多未能全部滿足工商需要，故行局貸款最大之效能，不過在减輕工商業之利息負担。據估計最近全市商業行莊之左款類，不過二萬餘億元。而國家行局十日來鉅額差入，總額巳在一萬二千餘億以上。按理物價實應比例猛跌，惟事實並不如此。復因內匯限制關係，外埠現鈔大量流向上海，重復回籠於國行。故抽緊銀根結果，徒為若干頭寸不受國家行局收縮銀根影嚮之特殊階級浩機會。而正當工商業及商業行莊，反直接遭受收縮銀根之打擊。渠等甚望當局在收縮銀根時，廳同時兼顧其他種種因素，尤須注意勿使生產資金凍結云。</p>

<h3>蘇聯肥田粉報紙　均切合我國需要</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政務會議中，關於中蘇商約之訂立，近有所討論。此間某熟悉中蘇實際商情之專家表示，：「根據以往數年之貿易經驗，蘇聯出口至我國之貨物，以肥田粉為大宗，我國今日仍為一農業國，肥田粉甚合需要。此外為報紙及木漿，均為目前需求之商品。至於我國所能供給蘇聯者，過去以桐油居第一位，其次為生絲。惟目前生絲在　行情日佳，銷路日旺，故除非蘇聯能出相當之高價，否則我國殆不肯供應。猪　過去亦為運蘇貨物之一，但蘇方曾於運返本國之後，再以低價傾銷於美國及歐洲市塲，以易得美匯。此點於蘇聯言，自有其一定之國策，但我國猪　之外銷，受其影響甚大。現今我國猪　之銷路甚佳，似無理由以此商品供給蘇聯，自壞我國之海外市場。茶葉亦曾為運蘇之商品，如對方需要，今後仍可供給。至於貿易額之大小，因蘇聯之商業悉由國家統制，故難於預測」。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕財部新訂國庫出　會記　度，　經中央銀行國庫局會計處等有關　　協商修訂補充自明年一月起開始實施。並經中央銀行　按現　情况，將全國暫劃分為十九區，分別成立十九個區分庫，辦部轄區內各分支庫庫款收支之　帳華報一等業務，各情業誌前報。該聞江蘇區分庫業務，決定由中央銀行國庫局滬局自行　辦。　正利極　備，定明年一月四日開關成立。屆時所有蘇省境內（包括京滬）代理國庫各行局牧付卅七年度各項庫款，均將按照新制度規定，報由江蘇區分庫轉帳，　報總庫轉列庫帳云</p>
<h3>戶口油開配後　中植停止配售</h3>
<p>中國植物油料廠，前　協助政府平抑油價，特舉辦食油配　。本市零售食油商，先後經審查合格者，共計六百餘家。每日至多配兩百桶，最多配一百桶，以兩百桶計算，幾佔本市每日油　二分之一。頃悉，本市戶口油已開始配給，該騷目無再配售必要，已於十九日宣告停配。</p>
<h3>造紙業增產計劃　三年後可以自給</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國經委會自通過造紙工業增產計劃後，各方非常重視，咸認照此計劃按步實施，不僅造紙工業可維持現狀，克服目前困難，且在三年之後，可達自供自給之目的。頃據某造紙業　成人士談：此計劃政府己着手實施，預計在三年內，由原有一萬四千噸，增產至七萬噸。但渠認為：　政府應設法供給木漿，在增產七萬噸中，應以半數作為製造白報紙之原料，而本市佔此數為二分之一。如木漿無法解決，不僅增產固受影響，而上海及靑烏各廠，亦勢必全部减產停工。　各紙廠配給木漿後，其所售紙價，應按成本加合法利潤出售，避免發生暴利情事。　造紙殺備，應乘此機會，重行整頓，以加強生產能力。　增產部份，應完全作為配給之用，以供應一般需要。　燃料供應，政府應合理配給。　加强管理工作，希望熟悉紙業機關，參加督導。</p>
<h3>疏通煤源與增加煤產</h3>
<p>當物價激無上　的時候，一般人都以為欲謀物價之穩定，就要有一個「治本」的方法。而治本之道，厥為貨暢其流與增加生產，其他種種揹施，都只能暫救燃眉之急。可是，在現階段，談到增加生產，只能從局部的着手。要局部的增加工業生產，惟有放寬工業用電的限制。蓋目前上海工業現有的生產量，似尙有增長之可能，有工具而無法生產者，比比皆是。而此種不能生產之原因，厥為電力之不足。在勝利以還，以迄於今，莫不鬧着煤荒。電流之供給，沒有煤就無以推動，听以問題的癥結，還是在煤的供應上面。</p>
<p>工業减產對於物價，頗有密切的關係。工業生產，是依據工業生產度來减低成品的成本。現在，因為電力不足，使工業生產速度逐步降低，因此成品的產本，不但無法减低，抑且更將增加。機器動與不動，廠　開支是一樣的，並且因為生產之不足，消費却無法减少，由是物價之狂　，常為必然之理。</p>
<p>我國煤之埋藏量，居世界之第三位，總量為二，一七六億公噸。但產出量近年來則報况愈下，就東北及華北二大產煤區，東北月產約卅萬噸，近以戰區日大，月產祗有七萬噸。華北產量更遜於東北，目前究有多少可產，事實上無法為確實估計。其他各礦目前合台灣·淮南·贛西·天河·鄱樂·永興·湘潭·宜章·源華·粵北·宜洛·華東各礦，充其量月產不過二一四，〇〇〇噸。除了各鐵路就近用煤之外，剩餘的工業用煤，恐怕是很少的了。更以交通阻梗，產出之煤，往往堆於礦區而無法運出，各礦以「煤」日積月累，堆存不能出運，生產資金就無法週轉，終至陷於半停頓狀態。</p>
<p>京滬一區，月需煤斤，就得二五萬噸，而加上鐵路用煤十萬噸，共為卅五萬噸，在冬季的用量，額外用煤及因天氣嚴寒而在熱率上所需要的增加數量，即佔計多一倍，亦不為過</p>
<p>南方用煤，向來多恃北來，因之現在我們仍冀求北方會區之能積極增加。同時對黃河以南的各區礦煤，應速予以救濟。更右進者，在交通方面，應以遝煤為第一目標，因為來源疏通，就使各礦資金，退速得到運轉，對於增加煤產，却有相輔而行的功用。（章柏庵）</p>

<h3>關於TVA</h3>
<p>— 漢</p>
<p>TVA立於一九三三年五月十八日，這時正當羅斯福總統上任還只幾個月，全國處在不景氣中，但是羅斯福在一遍反對聲中，竟願意祖任了這危險而鉅大的工程。</p>
<p>李連韜（Lilienthal）受命主持TVA是在一九四五年春天，這時是羅斯福總統將逝之際，所以社魯門上任後，第一件難於決定的大事，便是應否繼責任命李連韜為主持人，雖然有許多人反對李連韜繼任，但由於TVA區域的人民輿論，一致擁護李連韜之故，一切計劃終而未變。</p>
<p>李連韜主持TVA的工作，他是犧牲了私人企業中二十倍的薪水，而願為公共事業努力。</p>
<p>TVA成立後，直到今年，已有十四年的歷史，耗養了的金錢已有七萬萬五千萬美元以上，共有二十六座偉大的堤閘，其所用去的泥土磚石和鋼骨水泥的數量，足以用來塡滿一個貫穿地球，從美國直達中國的直徑十尺的大洞。</p>
<p>TVA是美國第一個全由聯邦設計的機構，它不僅有跨越各州界限的權力，同時還可以不受聯邦政府現存機構的約束。它有自治權，只受國會節制，對行政管理可以自己決定。分權嚴明，故難然組織廳大，但是各單位在各地發生的問題都能在當地立刻解決。無公文遊歷的流弊，也沒有因行政上而牽連到現實政治的問題，所有的工作人員，委任升遷，絕對根據他們的功績，經驗及才力而定。</p>
<p>TVA在成立以後，剛以初十年而言，已經使田納西流域三百二十二萬五千人的生活水準提高了百分之七十五，使全國人民平均生活水準，提高了百分之五十六。</p>
<p>它最顯著的成就，是使農村電氣化。規在在TVA區域內，共有十二萬五千個農莊使用了電氣。其他的成就，如完成六百五十哩長的可航運河，「土壤病院」網，二萬九千個示範農場，新發展的渔業，單寗工廠，鋸木工廠的踱物利用實驗室，一萬五千萬株新植捌木，此外還有成功了抗　運動。</p>
<p>TVA組織龐大複雜，一切都應用最新的科學理論與技術，故在社曾上起了極大的敎旨意義。它像一處大工場，也更像一問大學校，全體工作人員如同敎職員，他們的知識水準很高，相當美國鋼鐵公司和芝加哥大學及哈佛大學。因為他們是負有創造奇跡般的任務，所以沒有一個不是盡力從公。</p>
<p>TVA供電的區域，包括賞塔基州的四分之一，田納西州的全部，阿爾巴馬州的四分之一，密士失必州的三分之一，喬治亞州的十分之一，北卡洛林納州及浮琴尼亞州的一小部份。</p>
<p>TVA對洪水的控制，是一位最有力量的巨人，美國一九三七年的洪水，曾使百萬人無家可歸，一九四三年的洪水，曾冲毀四個州百萬畝田地，毀減了十六萬個家庭。然而，現在這些禍害，都　被TVA的的力量所約束訓服了。　TVA還完成了人類一件最值得歌頌的任務，就是它能完全的絕對的脫亂了政治勢力的影響給人類奠定了一個超然的偉大工程底創作！</p>
<p>我們髙唱入黨的TVA怎樣了！</p>
<h3>超聲速的火箭飛機</h3>
<p>— 鄭佐卿</p>
<p>從來沒有一架飛機能够有超過聲速的速率，但是據最近實騐，用火箭能的XS一號機，每小時能够飛行一于五百哩到二千五百哩，幾乎比聲音傳佈的速率還快三倍了。</p>
<p>這種比聲速澴快一二倍的髙速機，當然構造不同凡俗，牠有從來沒有過的更堅固的機身，能够抵禦十八倍於地心吸力的重力，XS一號機是美國空軍當局和裴耳航空公司及美國航空學會合作的結晶品。</p>
<p>雖然是高度的流綫型式，這種吃大壓力的火箭飛機倒還保特相當飛機的外貌。牠有一對用鋁合金製成的極薄的機翼；這個機翼為了避免焊接不河靠的關係，是從整塊的鋁合金上切下來的。</p>
<p>機內共有四個引擎，用酒精和液體氣氣作為燃料。每個引擎能够產生一千五百磅的衝力，所以一共便有六千磅的推進力。一磅的衝力等於速率每小時三百七寸五哩時的一匹馬大；舉個例說，一磅的衝力也是等於在速率每小時七百五十哩時的兩匹馬力。引擎的功率輸出因此隨牠的速度同時增長。控制功率輸出的方法是利用四個引擎中那幾個休息和另外幾個發動的方法，所以駕駛員發動一個引擎時，便有一千五百磅的衝力，發動二個時便有三千磅；依此類推，可得1500　　　　4500；6000；四種不同的衝力，由此隨心所欲，隨機應變，臺果一咱特別設計的　輪　筒（turbo－pump）完成的話，更慢的速率也能操羅。</p>
<p>該機長三十一呎，從地面量到機尾頂點共髙十呎十吋，翼展較小，共僅二十八呎，無載時共重四千八百九十二磅；其中用作高速飛行硏究時的儀器巳重五百二十六磅，但火箭燃料却重八千一百七十七磅，比空機竟重一倍半有餘，為了節省燃料的負重起見，一個B——二十九型機先得把XS一號機拖到髙空，然後由它自行發動，傳作實騐。機實騐報吿，該機雖然能有三倍聲速的髙速率，但須在八萬呎高空時作用方才最佳。</p>

<h3>紅葉</h3>
<p>— 微遠</p>
<p>當你遊　罷湖山秋景歸來後，我想你一定會帶幾片紅葉回家的，於是當你將它們夾在書本中或點綴在案頭時，你可能吟誦起「我從野外拾回來一個秋天」的詩句。</p>
<p>也許你家裏有個種有梧桐或楓樹的院子，那末當侵晨或傍晚的岑靜中，你又可能在桐樹或楓樹底下體味過古詩人的「落花寂寂」一樣的「落葉寂寂」的詩意。</p>
<p>我所以要這樣說，因為我要告訴你紅葉——洛業是一種自然現象，正綠果子熟透了它一定有個時候要掉下一樣，並不定要風吹它或人摘它。當然有風吹動時，就更易掉下了。</p>
<p>我不曉得你有沒有注意過你拾得的那幾片紅葉的葉柄基部，如果你曾注意過的話，我想你一定會詫異不已的，因為它們的基部都是很光滑的平面。並不像是折斷面。</p>
<p>這個面就是紅葉的由來。</p>
<p>這個面的發生是這樣的：普通一張葉子的葉柄上，朝上面部份有個凹缺的二旁生有二條機械組織（Collenchyma），因為這二條有如二條鐵皮似的機械組織的着生，樹葉子就像有了它們的保險帶似的很難給風從樹枝上吹下來。但是當秋風吹上大地的時候，氣候已開始變凉了，而且也變得乾燥。空氣巾水份太少，就要引起樹葉子裏的水份向外跑，水份常向外跑，於是不但葉子的光合作用（水和碳酸氣在陽光中田葉綠綠素合成碳水化合物的作用）不能進行，而且要引起體內水份倒溢的現象——植物體內的水份外跑，這是植物生命的無上威脅——正像人類吐瀉失水過多可以有生命危險一樣。</p>
<p>植物就如此坐而待斃嗎？不，它們有非常微妙的作用——落葉未防止這威脅。這作用就發生在葉柄基部：</p>
<p>葉柄基部本來是由堅韌的永久組織組成的。秋風一起，那部份就慢慢的變成為有活動能力的分生組織（Seconoary　Meristem）了。道分生組織在葉柄基部逐漸生成一　片　做亂　（Abscissionlayer）的柔膜組織，由於這離層的生成就將機械組織以及大小葉脈完全隔斷。葉脈是能報送水份的，它一斷了，水路交通也就斷了，於是植物體內的水份不必再　　會損失得太多而致枯死。水份旣從葉中跑到乾燥的空氣裏去，同時又已沒有了重得的來源，遂漸的，葉子就開始失去了它們的綠色年華。等待着有一天葉子在枝頭上著生的力量已極小時，葉子就辭條下樹了。當然，這種為了母體的安全，而無視於小我的存在與否的落葉現象，美有它的深切的意味的。</p>
<p>當然，有人還要問：葉片變成紅色又是怎樣的一回事？</p>
<p>那是這樣的：植物細胞內包含有質體（Plastids），質體中又可分無色素體（Leacoplas）綠色素體（Chloroplast），其（無色素體可變成綠色及其他色素體，這可從色心菜的白色菜心變絲見到）。而綠色素體中又可分綠葉素（Chlorophyll），葉黃素（Xanthophyll），橙黃素（Carotin）等，這幾種色紫體往往可隨環境不同而變異（比如械樹葉予就可有幾種顏色）。愈近綠色的色素體愈對光合作用有利，愈近紅色的就愈有相反的效果，所以常樹葉感到不該苒在缺少水份的時期中營光合作用時，它裏面的近紅色的色素體就漸漸的加多了。像楓樹葉成為紅葉，而悟桐　却不過是黃色的枯案，就都由於這道理。</p>
<p>末了，願你珍藏你的紅葉　，它是富有詩意和羅曼絲的！</p>

<h3>數字分節的漢化</h3>
<p>— 周實民</p>
<p>當我們寫下一長川數目字的時候，譬如說6，390·000·000這個數目，為了便於認識它的單位，從末位起每隔三個數字我們打一　（　），這就是我所指　數字分節號。也許很多人對這個問題並沒有深切攷　過，一向就用一種機械式的記　，認定第一　前面的那位數字是代表「千」位數，第二搬是「百萬」（Million），第三搬是「十萬萬」（Billion），依此類推。其實這種記憶對於一個中國的學習者，的確是一種累　，很不方便。至少當我個人及所接觸的許多朋友和同舉們，要認識一長串數字的時候，這些　並沒有給我們任何一些的便利，因此我提出這個改良的意見，求能比較地適合我國的習慣和系統，那就是要著重漢化。</p>
<p>在未談到改良方法之前，我們不妨先推究一下為什麼過去我們會採用這種不合習慣的分筋法的原因，這對於我們進一步去尋求改良法的動機，是有帮助的。無疑的，我們不加變易，近乎囫　吞棗地抄製了西洋一套數字分節法。而實際上這種分節法在他國却倒是有便利的地方。以英國說，進位的單位是個十，百，千，百萬，兆等等，並沒有「萬」及「萬萬」的單獨磟不，所以40000被稱為“forty　thousaud”。800，000，000被稱為：eight　huhdred　million＂，而因此第一個分節號在第三位數前，第二個分節號在第六位數字之前了。在英文讀法裏，誠然這是比較的便利。</p>
<p>但這種方法自然只適用於某種系統。到中國，一個有「萬」單位的國度裏，我們總不致於稱四萬為「四十千」吧　對於一個高中或大學生，英文程度比較好，也許經過轉瞬間的猶豫，順利地讀出一串長數目，而對初中甚至小學程度的孩子們，更廣泛地顧到些沒有讀過英文而必須應用數字的民衆，我們是否一定要固執這種外國分節法呢！我們不是應該　「可能」地建立一種適合本國系統的法則嗎！</p>
<p>方法是這樣的簡單：我們就利用普通情形中到達的最高單位「萬」的關係，由間隔三位數字變成間隔四位數字。第一個分節號置放在第四位數前面，前一位數的單位即「萬」，第二個分節號按照四進位，置放在第入位數前面，而第二分節號前一位即「萬萬」，第三分而號置放第十二位數字前，單位「萬萬萬」……其他類推。</p>
<p>每兩個分節號間所夾的一群千位數（即四位數字），除了按照分節號所在的情形加上「萬」或「萬萬」等單位外，讀法自然與普通情形一樣，無須考慮。一目暸然了。下面的例子，極其簡單，可以將我們意思表達得更淸楚些。</p>
<p>這樣的問題，在未提出前，或者覺得沒有注意的價値，彼提出來以後，也顯得極平凡，膚淺，但是我却希望大家一致棌用，樹立我國自己的系統。它的便利和重要計有三點；第一，可避免不規則的記憶。第二，改良後有助於科學的通俗北。第三，也是最重要的一點，我們不能永遠存著尾隨人家的觀念。我們應該努力自奮，建立起自己的科學系統，並對世界學術有所貢獻。</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>飛魚</h3>
<p>— 瞿友仃</p>
<p>氣候較　之海洋中，常有飛魚出現，為自然界之一大奇蹟，久為生物學家們所注意，此種景象雖常見之，但欲得精確之觀察則非易事。通常肉眼所見，不外魚羣自水面突躍而起，滑翔二三秒鐘後，再安返水中。經傳物學者們利用攝影等新式之觀察方法，最近始知其飛翔時並不若鳥類之拍擊其「翅」，僅係一種滑翔而已。</p>
<p>魚身構造能飛之魚類共有四類，但最易見而善飛者，厥為Exocoetodae科中之Cypsemrus族。其腹　及胸鰭均較適於飛翔，此種魚類生活接近海面，游行迅速；體成流綫型，有巨大之眼睛，酷似靑花魚。其流綫型之身體，旣宜於飛翔，且便於迅速之游泳。腹部之體面平滑，以便隨時升降，尾部之形狀與普通魚類相同，亦成V字形；惟V形之下部較長，幾。為上半之一倍半，因此種形狀之尾部對於飛行大有帮助之故。更重要者為成雙之鰭翅，成為飛翼，為其對於飛行最顯著之適應力；胸　約為全身總長之三分之二，展開時而積幾為腹部禮面之兩倍。游冰時胸　緊貼身畔，飛行時則擴展幾至橫互全身。　之背面由薄膜組成，中有十至十二支射綫狀脊骨支持，腹鰭遠較胸　為小，多成四角形，其他構造與胸　相似。</p>
<p>飛行悄况飛行開始時，魚類以其游泳之高速而突破水面；此種高速，據估計為每小時十五至二十哩左右。且由所攝照片　知，當魚突水而出者，其身體幾與水面平行而並非　直。頃刻飛入空際，則胸　立即展開，腹鰭緊縮，如此則因尾部所得支持力較頭部為少之故，以致魚身與水面成一約為十五度之角度，尾部下牛葉片逐餘留水中；於此位置沿水面前進，謂之「起飛」。起飛時尾部在水中作劇烈擺動，擺速約為每秒五十次；由此速更增，直至達到空中速度而後止。至於空中行速究為幾何，有多種不同之估計——約從每小時三十五哩至五十五哩左右；然據普通之活動攝影機所攝照片視之，其速當為每小時二十五至三十哩。惟此或僅係接近滑翔末點時之速度，蓋剛出水時之速度過高幾無法攝影，故每小時四十哩當為其滑翔初速之最妙估計。</p>
<p>當起飛時，因尾部劇烈擺動，故魚身難免顫抖，尤以其翅（胸鰭）為然（然並非擊拍其翔）。待空中速度到達後，腹鰭亦被展開，魚身更進一步與水面平行，斜率約僅六度；同時尾部即脫水而出。自此角即以離水國約一呎左右之距離，作等高度之滑翔，而速度則漸减。然為使速度减而仍能保持等高計，兩翅與水平面之交角須繼續增大。及至空中速度失去時。或則魚身立即墜入水中，或則腹鰭一再緊縮，尾部下墜入水，劇烈擺動，遂重獲「起飛」之高速，再作二次滑翔。此種再度起飛之情形常可見　：且有反覆滑翔至十次者。</p>
<p>通常其滑翔約可延長至三四秒鐘，但有時多較為短促；據哈甫思（H　bbs）之多次觀察，估計共平均飛行時間為二。六秒（包括「起飛」時間）。但亦有人觀察得十秒至十三秒之耙錄者，此當非常見者。至於飛行之距程，顯然隨風力及風向而不問；平靜空氣中之飛行，平均滑翔鉅程約為四十至五十祝，但亦有一百碼之估計數。如為例外之十秒以上之滑翔，距程當為更大。至其飛行末期之行速則為每小時二十五英哩左右。</p>
<p>科學辭彙</p>
<h3>鎘棒</h3>
<p>— 鮑鍾祺</p>
<p>——原子能控制者</p>
<p>鎘棒的英文原名是Cadmiumrod，它的名字似乎並不經見於報章雜誌，不過它却是不可一世的原子彈的尅星，比迥旋通等儀器更重要。</p>
<p>鎘棒顧名思義是一種錀質製的長棒，它具有一種特別的性質——能够吸收中子（Neutron），就因為它有這種特性，而被應用於試騐原子能的實騐中。</p>
<p>美國的原子能專家們，最初在芝加哥大學的實騐場中，試騐原子的分裂，他們用中子衝擊　（Uranium）原子，使它引起分裂而產生二或三個中子和大量的能，再由產生的中子與其他的　原子造成一個通鎖反應（Choin　reaction），生成極大量的原子能。</p>
<p>但是，能够被中子擊破的鈾原子是鈾二三五，而普通的鈾鑛大都是鈾二三八，鈾二三五的含最很少。</p>
<p>因此，科學家設法分離這兩個同位元素，可是因為兩者化學性質相同，不易分雞。為了解決這個閑難，一個新的假設成立了，要是能够使鈾二三八變成其他元　素，一定分離較易。</p>
<p>於是，在一個石墨（註）與鈾鑛相間隔的墩堆Pile中，科學家用中子通過石墨去衝擊鈾二三八，它的結果與鈾二三五的分裂相似：產生了兩個新的元素——鋸（Neptunium）和鈹（Plutonium），同時更產生了大量的能和中子。</p>
<p>這些中子就是揭露微小而神秘的原子宇宙的關鍵　，它能够使鈾二三五和鈹的原子核引起分裂，原子彈的爆發就是由於這個基本的觀點。要是沒有鎘棒的發明，中子失去了控制，它的數字激增到相當的比例時。芝加哥大學的實驗場早就炸毀了，那末原子彈到幾世紀後才能發明是沒有人能够斷言的。</p>
<p>對於原子彈幅射能的防禦，美國的科學家們也許正在對鍢棒作更進一步的硏究吧！</p>
<p>註：石墨的應用在於使中子速率降低因低速中子易引起分裂。</p>

<h3>悼張薄老</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>張溥老（繼）是第一個把革命思想傳播於學界的人。那是前淸光緒的末季，梁任公的新民叢報與張翁主持的民報，　開筆仗。這兩個報當時在內地都是禁物，或由留日友人直寄校舍，或私下托人買讀，與梁氏正面交鋒雖是胡漢民章太炎執筆論文居多，而發行者即是「張繼」的大名。因之一般靑年，對張印象最早而溥。</p>
<p>民國十七年，國民革命軍底定北平，統一華夏，張翁擔任第一屆的政治分會生席，兼平民大學董事長。與校長汪伯老（大變）舊交（張留學日本時，汪充留學生監督，後又任駐日公使，對張甚契重），故對校務非常熱心，每次校務會議必親出席。敎職同仁實際瞻仰了這位革命元老，以為英雄氣慨，辟易千人，原來樸實安詳，一團和氣。我談到當年校中倫讀民報的前事，他都歸功於漢民太炎諸位。</p>
<p>「方面大耳，虎頭　　」，仍可看出演趙慷慨悲歌的本色，他的原籍是滄州，在天津之甫津浦綫上一個大站，「衝繁疲難」四字要缺，河北有名的三大州之一（琢州。通州·滄州），古名「長蘆」，與鹽山慶雲及山東之武定皆濱臨渤海，多豪俠之士，風俗强悍，體魄健偉。二十四年首都六中會會，汪警衛遇阻，張繼將刺客　腰抱住，足見勇往熱烈之精神，危念關頭，自然表現，無愧北方之强。其後汪做漢奸，溥老深悔當初攔阻刺客，留他活着作孽。</p>
<p>光復之初，張翁與鹿鐘麟充宣慰使，巡行演薊，撫視災黎，給與倫陷區人以不少之安慰。昨聞此老於十六之夜以狹心病陡發，濾爾逝世，壽止六十有六（吳佩孚終於二十八年，亦六十六），頗出意外，以其康強樸素，是八旬以上的壽相也。然民報一般作者，胡·章早已不在人間，至此血流頓盡矣。</p>
<h3>冬至夜</h3>
<p>— 如意</p>
<p>急景凋年，轉眼已是冬至了。今年的冬至節正好在聖誕夜的前一天，中西節令踵接而來，更使人有「歲聿云暮」之感。　又過去了艱辛的一年！</p>
<p>「冬至大如年」，冬至的前一夜正是合家團聚的最歡欣的時候；但是，天寒地凍，兵戎禾息，就是最樂天的人們也不禁瑟縮罷？</p>
<p>我想起了煤斤同樣缺乏的英國，我想起了英國人在患難中「昻然過去」（Chinup）的精神。這眞是一種值得效法的精神。處今日之世，士大夫所謂遁跡山林的逃壁現實已經絕對不可能。與其在想像中的桃花源陶醉，不如毅然正對現實；少裝空場面，多做一點脚踏實地的工作。明知道前面困難重重，明知道路上多的是絆脚石；可是，如果不遭逢困難，也就沒有了克服困難的愉快</p>
<p>涸轍之鮒，相濡以沬，在這個最凜冽的時候，讓我們互相安慰，互相勉勵，讓我們挑選這最因難的時候立定決心，事在人為，下一年是應當比今年好的！</p>
<h3>談火雞</h3>
<p>— 周性初</p>
<p>聖誕節又將降臨，美麗悅目的火鷄應時上市了。西方習俗，在這聖誔一天的菜看中，必配以火鷄，以資慶祝，有的以為禮品之一，餽贈親友。</p>
<p>火鷄是吐綬鷄的俗稱，吐經鷄的名詞，不若火鷄的來得盡人而知。牠又有眞珠鷄，白露鷄，孝烏等名稱，原產地在北美大陸，大概在遠古時候，即巳飼養，據說火鷄係西歷一四九九年傳入曰歐洲。</p>
<p>明朝李時珍本草綱目上說：「火　出巴峽閩廣山中，人多　玩，大如家鷄，小者如　　，頭頰如雉，羽色多黑，雜以黃白　點如眞珠斑，項有　襲，內藏肉綬，常時不見，每逢春夏晴明，則向日擺之，頂上先出兩翠角，二寸許，乃徐舒其額下之綬，長請近尺，紅碧相間，采色煥爛，踰時悉劍不見」。唐劉禹錫詩云：「越山有烏翔廖廓，　中天綬光若若，越人偶見而奇之，因名吐綬江南知。四明天姥神仙地，朱烏星精鍾異氣，赤玉雕成彪炳毛，紅綃翦出玲瓏翅，湖烟始開山日髙，迎風吐綬盤花絛，臨波自染琅　草，映葉疑開王母桃。……」從這首詩上看來，我國在唐朝已有火鷄了。今據荷蘭語啡牠為唐國烏，那末產自我國了。臼本人因牠的頭及前頭部都裸出，牠的皮膚為疣狀物，上嘴根有乖肉，懸　於嘴下，能時時變色，故啡做七面烏。</p>
<p>目前我國的火鷄繁殖地，為浙江的定海，其所以出產火鷄，也有一段國際性的史實。當淸道光年間鴉片戰爭，英人曾佔據定海，携來火鷄很多，在英軍離開後，留下了火鷄的種。當地鄉民以火鷄形狀美麗，肉味鮮肥，而又值錢，於是相　飼養，蔓延迄今，產量年有增加，而火鷄竟成為定海的特產了。</p>
<p>火谿的肉質較家鷄為老，且極乾　，我國人吃起來很不合胃口。可是歐美人的口味，却說其味無窮，遠勝家鷄的肥而鮮美，無怪他們要以為一年一度的珍貴的住饌。</p>
<p>美國普通的火鷄，每隻重二十多斤，而我國最重的不過十多斤，普通的祇四五斤而巳，其成續之差，完全由於飼養的不講究。如果我們加以改良，用科學化的方法去飼養，那就可以與舶來品競爭，且可有補於農民的生計。</p>
<h3>聯話</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>臺州中子山張瞧陽廟聯云：「　慨誓師，守睢陽最爾之區，孤城中，人皆樂死；從容盡節，振河北英雄之氣，千載後，貌尙如生。」（見冷廬雜識）讀之，當日情形可想。</p>
<p>余少時讀書溫州，偶遊江心寺，見寺門一聯云：「雲朝朝，朝朝朝，朝朝朝散；潮長長，長長長，長長長消。」相傳為宋狀元王梅溪公在寺中　書時所作，未知然否？其讀法頗費人解，余意第一「朝」字上平聲，第二「朝」宇下平聲，第三第四皆上平·第五下平，第六上一平，第七下平，第八上平。下聯字上聲，第三第四皆平聲，第五上，第六平，第七上，第八平。為之標點如此，未悉尙有其他讀法否？希讀者敎之是幸。近見福州梁章鉅浪跡續談，提及此聯亦，但未為之句讀，僅謂余四十三年前到此，曾目擊此聯，以其費解置之云云，可見是聯非僅作如此解也。余聞之吾師周之喬云：寺中尙有一聯，亦為梅溪公之筆，聯云：「雙塔巍峨，直似鼓槌　白日；一城環繞，倒生牙齒咬靑天。」蓋在江心寺中可見溫州環繞之城，而孤嶼（即江心寺所在地，孤嶼名不甚彰，邑人均以江心寺概稱）兩端各有一塔，身歷其境，方知此聯之切貼絕妙，余先聞聯語，而後遊寺，但遍覓此聯無着，詢之　時同遊者，亦皆云未見，然此聯必在江心寺，移之他處，則不切用，而梁章鉅先生浪跡續談，錄溫州名勝楹聯最詳，亦未載及此聯，未知何故，姑記之以待再訪。</p>
<h3>補藥</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>商業廣吿是最富季節性的，看看這幾天報紙上的廣告，知道現在該是「進補」的時令了。甚麼吉林人參，　羅官燕，老港珠粉，以及應時補品，各色膏滋　等，眞是名目衆多，目不盡覽。此外像魚肝油和各種維他命，也屬於這一類。</p>
<p>人體具有新陳代謝的作用，這是人盡皆知的常識。機器出了毛病要配另件修理，人體出了毛病雖不便配另件，却也得修理，這就呌做「進補」。而且「進補」的功用據說不僅在事後，且也有預防的功效，補樂廣告中常見的所謂延年益　，便是這個意思。</p>
<p>不過，補藥無論怎樣的功效偉大，終究不過是藥而已；根據醫藥常識，一個人要服藥是萬不得已的事，最好是「幸占勿藥」，如果非服藥不可，亦得「對症下藥」才是個道理。</p>
<p>但時下有許多人對「藥」的看法却不同；像膏滋藥，人參再造丸，魚肝油之類固被視為通常的補藥，就是應該請醫生檢定身體後使用的各種維他命丸，以及各種補針，甚至歐美人日常食用和牛奶等，竟也有人視為是補藥或補品的。　　把牛奶雞蛋等看做是「補品」，固然是表現了我們民生的食困，但另一面看到國粹補藥之多，却又不得不令人與吾民　　多病夫的感想。</p>
<p>因為現在喫得起補藥的人，大概都是平時營養生活尙佳，無需急切「藥補」的人，他們所以甘願化了大錢買苦水喝，不外是由於「延年益壽一一念吧了。換句話親，歲是無病呻吟。而無病呻吟却正是我們民族間的一個嚴重的社會病症。</p>
<p>幾年前歐美人提倡「人生始自四十」之說，現在更進而討論「人生始於七十或八十」了。意思是說：一個人的眞正生活開始，應在四五十歲左右，就是七十八十，也猶是老當益壯，大有可為。</p>
<p>但在我國却不同，所謂三十「而立」，四十而「不感」，以後便是「知命」，便應該是「豎壽板」以待「壽終正寢」了。我們的生命觀念旣是如此「未老先衰」，社會上那得不多無病呻吟之士，我們的民族怎能避免「病夫」之譏？</p>
<p>這並不是說補藥不該喫；營養不足的人應該多喫魚肝油或甚麼膠之類，最好是人人能視牛奶鷄蛋為家常便飯。但太迷信了所謂「補」，把生命的活力反而弄得萎靡不振，養成社會缺乏進取的風氣，那才是「補不償失」了。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第五章　飛來橫禍　（三）</p>
<p>渚　想來想去，綺紈無非是為了　術奮鬥，竟不異犧牲色相，一個如花似玉的美人，配上一個五官不正，面目可附的　鬼，精神上是如何苦痛！想着心裏甚是不平，不禁站了起來。小王媽一看大驚，問道：「徐先生，要走嗎？」渚齋給她一提，才又裝出步履因難，一步一拐說道：「是的，我要走了。」小王媽道：「慢點，慢點！我佩車去。「出去一會，進來回道：「車來了。」渚齋隨手由衣袋內拿出幾張鈔要，塞在小王媽乎裏道：「謝謝你，老板回來，不要告訴她。」小王媽捏着鈔票推讓不要，渚齋已一拐一拐，走出街門，上車去了。那車夫却是一個老人，雙手把住車把，好似老牛般，一步一步慢慢走，渚齋在車上，一心紙想念綺紈的遭遇，非常難過。想戲劇原是專門的藝術，現在伶人的地位，雖然比從前提髙，一般鑒當藝術的人，却不及從前待人厚道。在二十年前，凡具有藝術天才，可以造就的伶人，一經顧曲家賞議，必畫心造就他，獎進他的藝術，像現在梅，程，荀，尙諸氏，能自成一家，都是由當時幾位名士和富翁賞識，造就現在的地位，他們一秉道義之交，皆在助人成名，別無其他作用，現在人心不古，一切都是自私自利，所謂角家，花一筆銘出去，交須把本利全撈回來，滿足他的欲望。像綺紈這樣一個具有藝術天才，若在二十年前，一遇名家賞識，便可　價十倍，何至似現在如此可憐，為的一些添置行頭，竟屈身低首，供人擺弄，其志可嘉，其遇也可悲了了！所恨自己無此能力，家中雖有薄產，在老父掌管之下，不能挪動，不然，必盡我力量，供給綺紈。成就她的前程，若照她眼前現况，隨波逐流，意志稍為不堅，很容易墮落，我和他萍水相逢，承她一見如舊，把心腹的話，都告訴我，足見她村心忠厚。她口口　聲，說我誠實，認我是她的知己，我不能幫她的忙，問心眞是慚愧。那晚皓月當空，人力車走得很慢，渚齋因腦筋縈繞着綺紈，也不覺車夫是一個老頭子，g　步一步由他走，也不見的走得慢，眼望月亮，勾引起在公園和綺紈軟語溫存的情况，心中十分感慨。所恨賴見太晚，若是在半年以前相遇，自己尙未娶婦，也許有好花月圓的可能，可見天公太弄人，沒有事呌人滿意。渚齋正仰頭望着月光，想入非非之際，突然耳邊聽到慘呼聲音，不由一怔。</p>
<h3>虛名</h3>
<p>— 季庸</p>
<p>李白是第一個反對名的，雖然他也不大　利。「但願生前一杯酒，何須悠悠千載名」？話是說的很達觀，然而與其人不大相稱，為什麼求賀知章高力士，又為什麼投了永王璘，听以變成不得意發牢騷，不成氣候。柳永作了一句「忍把浮名，換了淺斟低唱」，丟了臨車放榜的進士公，亦可稱為文字獄之　致者。然道裏所說都是屬於道家思想的「隱士型」，並非本題之本意。</p>
<p>此處所謂虛名，是「浪得」之物。世上不乏得不處之譽者，一叩其實，常常令人意外的失望，尤其在政治上，書本蓋往往與事實截然不同也。張端義貴耳集卷下一則云：</p>
<p>「士大夫最怕有虛名，虛名一勝，不為朝廷福。眞西山負一世盛名，豈西山眞欲愛名於天下，天下自聞其名而起敬耳。及史同叔之死，天下之人皆曰：値院入朝，天下太平可望。及其入朝，前譽小减。……都下諺日：若要百物賤，須是眞值院，及至喚得來，攪作一鍵麵！如此，則聲名自是一項，事業自是一項，江南土地淺薄，士大夫只作得一項，作不得兩項。」</p>
<p>這非常給愛好「文章正宗」者流以打擊。一鍵麵者，今北人猶有此語，　改作鍋，言其亂糟糟也。西山乃宋學翹楚，其成績不過爾爾，何怪後來人駡道學者只會「無事袖手談性命，臨危一死報君王」也？</p>
<p>然而猶不止此。我記得周密癸辛雜識裏駡道學的文章非常之多，宋元學案的後面有附截，李越縵在日記中亦極稱之，可惜不在手邊，無從抄引，只要略記得是嫌他們太偽而已。士大夫在夫遇之前，每有一套虛矯的法寶，今所謂「大砲」之類是也。可是到了自己登台，也就會利令「道」昏起來，聖經賢傳，一搭刮子忘到九瞥雲外，明初解縉何當不是理學家，一面大鬧要殉建文之國，一面却詳細的問着今天豬仔喂過沒有，可笑亦可嘆，我之所以對道學家失敬者為此。</p>
<p>不過世人是短見者多，對於一聲旣大且響之砲，總難免投以驚奇的眼光，而表示欽佩。却完全忘記了每天在讀着的富蘭克林名言：「“Great-talkers　are　Ittle　coers」豈不糟糕？於此就給野心家又開了一個門徑，砲不妨大放而特放，則功名當貴汨汨然來矣。</p>
<p>張端義是鄭州人而住在蘇州，前語對南方同胞難免不敬。唯在宋代，南人不得為相及狀元，是開國時定制。到後來就分成兩派，守舊派的司馬光是北人，革新派的王安石是南人。錢賓四云，蔡京一黨，多是南人（見國史大綱），或者張氏亦慨乎言之歟？如今我們自然不再有地域觀念，但在淸代異軍突起，專講實行，而反對虛聲的顏李學派，則道地的保定府　縣楚溪春之鄉前輩也，此亦可以深念者。</p>
<p>我問你：對於素所仰望的名人，而眞感竟不失望的有幾位？</p>
<h3>年齡計算法</h3>
<p>— 葛春良</p>
<p>一個倫敦的交際花，有一次間蕭伯納，「你看我今年幾歲？」</p>
<p>蕭伯納說：「從你的牙齒上來判斷你的年齡，我該說祇有十八歲；從你燙卷了的頭髮上看，祗有十九歲；從你的態度上看，祇有十四歲。」</p>
<p>那個女人很高興，說：「感謝你的好話，但是，倒底你看我有幾歲？」</p>
<p>蕭伯納說：「啊，那不是很容易算的嗎？把十八，十九，十四，一同加起來，答案是五十一歲。」</p>
<h3>花草誌（上）</h3>
<p>— 夢農</p>
<p>負傷的菊花</p>
<p>賣得了兩株菊花，可是家事只有空盆，這眞有點兒窘，啡他們怎樣生存下去呢？眼看着這兩株有根而無泥的菊花，活生生地萎死下去，實在有所不忍，只得搜索枯腸，給牠們想辦法。</p>
<p>想到還有一雙空瓶于在畫架的角落裏。拂去了薄塵，盛之以淸水，也許可以救救菊花的生命，這樣一想，兩株菊花總算有了安身之處。一株種在磁盆裏，另一株則供養在膽瓶裏去了，同樣地成為了我家秋冬之際的小擺設了</p>
<p>隔了幾天，面對着道兩件小擺設一看，生存或生命的問題却在暗地裘突然爆發了。盆中的菊花，原是安置在窗檻上的，可以餐風，也可以飲露，自然也可以晒太陽，冷不防的，這一夭，突然發了一陣大風，窗子受了猛風的襲擊，撞倒了菊花，其中一部分花瓣被壓傷了，漸漸地傷致死了；但是，最令人驚奇的是：若干沒有負傷的花瓣，却一夭比一天碩大，茁壯，這裏顯示着牠們正在被摧殘的狀能下發展輝煌的，更有力的一綫生命。</p>
<p>回頭看看膽瓶裏的菊花的光景，一般爭妍鬥勝的氣象也正湧現在我的面前。雖然，根斷了，葉疏了，花折了，甚至泥土的影子也不見了，只留下了一點一滴的淸水，可是，菊花，被折在這裏，並不就此枯獎下去，猶如岩石縫的野草一樣，在彎彎曲曲地湧出生存的力量。　　「離下菊初發，一枝輕折來，可憐心未死，猶向膽瓶開！」</p>
<p>如果我是詩人，我一定寫下這樣的詩句作為我對於瓶菊的命運的哀吟。</p>
<h3>從小看大</h3>
<p>— 吉爾</p>
<p>前輩論人，往往有一種成見，就是「從小看大」。雖然「小時了了，大未必佳」；而倘小時不了了，似乎大來是更不會佳的。這種高瞻遠矚，其準確性自是頗堪商討，但亦不無相當理由，因此上一代的人都歡喜用這一套，不知現在還通用否。</p>
<p>舅父告訴我，他應京試的時候，年歲尙輕，當時翁常熟為相國，凡子弟入京應試，以鄉誼進謁的，都予接見，並且有求書　聯屏語的，亦均不拒絕，因之他亦就登門進見了。那天在內廳，同座人不多，有人提議打牌，常熟就囑他入局，自己則立而旁觀。移時局散，常熟語舅父，少年忌刻薄，觀君尙稱厚道！又麻將尙能籍以觀人品性，價是從「小」看「大」了。大槪一個人的脾氣，於不知覺問最易流露，打牌時不免得意忘形，所以能　露情性。這與藉所寫的字以觀察人的品性，或許是同一意義。</p>
<p>除此之外，文人作文，亦往往好「從小看大」。古人頗多因日常瑣屠而發為宏論，尤其淸代，又如鄭板橋家書等，然亦有病其太「由小見大」者。近日報竄雜誌之文，亦大都屬於此「從小看大」類，先談瑣事，再發　論，頗足代表一時風氣。蓋倘不「從小看大」，則又能如何呢？</p>

<h3>This Year's Constitution Implementation to Begin on Christmas Day; Chairman Broadcasts Encouragement to All Citizens to Jointly Strive to Build a New China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] At the request of the Shanghai Gospel Broadcasting Station, Chairman Chiang delivered a Christmas Day broadcast at 9:00 PM on the 21st. The Chairman's speech was recorded in Nanjing one day prior and sent to Shanghai for broadcast by the station.</p>
<p>The final section of the Chairman's speech stated: This Christmas, our China will begin to implement a new democratic constitution. This will be the day when the Republic of China and all its people will begin a new era of unity, independence, equality, and freedom. He also said: We believe that the implementation of the new constitution is only the initial step in achieving our ultimate goal of building a new China. However, this represents an epoch-making progress for China's three thousand years of autocratic rule and for building society. I hope that all our compatriots, with faith and sincerity, will work together to move forward. I believe that we will soon be able to complete our predetermined journey, which is to build our Three Principles of the People's New China. The full text of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen across the country: This week, the whole world is celebrating the joyous festival of the birth of Jesus, the Gospel of mankind. Therefore, everyone's emotions are focused on love and peace among mankind. All the unstable and unpleasant atmosphere in the world seems to have diminished during this period.</p>
<p>During this joyous festival for the whole world, our Chinese compatriots should also feel happy and gratified for the blessing of Christ's birth, saving people and saving the world, just like other countries. All our compatriots, regardless of what religion they believe in, regardless of what occupation they engage in, welcome the two lofty ideals symbolized by the birth of Christ: "World Peace" and "Universal Love." We believe that many of the evils and problems in the world today can only find solutions from this ideal.</p>
<p>It is often said that the time in a year to express the spirit of Christ is too short. There is no way to make every day of the 365 days of the year so happy and joyous. This is a great regret for mankind.</p>
<h3>Every Christmas, We Should Examine Our Own Lives; The Whole World Needs the Inspiration of the Spirit of Christ</h3>
<p>But in my opinion, Christmas has a greater significance for people:</p>
<p>The arrival of Christmas every year provides us with the best opportunity for self-reflection in the year, to sincerely examine our own lives. How much work have we done for the country, for our compatriots, and for the people of the world during this year? When we face the great fact of Christ's birth, we should think about the following question: Do our lives and work match the lofty ideals of this savior? Are we truly striving to create the peaceful world revealed by Christ's spirit of willingly sacrificing himself for the sins of others?</p>
<p>This question has the same profound meaning for our national life and for our personal lives. Because national life is the expansion of personal life. At a time when unstable factors still exist in the international community and mankind is suffering from pain, bewilderment, and trials, each of us, our entire world, urgently needs the inspiration of the spirit of Christ.</p>
<h3>Understanding the Truth of Christ</h3>
<p>If we can use the eyes of Christian faith to observe the current world situation, then the chaotic and dark phenomena we see can immediately be revealed as bright. Here we can know that any humiliation, any suffering, is an inevitable experience for our country in the long journey of self-reliance. Amidst the various pains and difficulties that China encounters today, we must also truly understand the truth of Christ's salvation: "Conquering evil with righteousness" and "Overcoming evil with good." Then, with an indomitable spirit, without hesitation, and without wavering, we can move forward bravely. There is no difficult problem that cannot be solved, and there is no painful problem that cannot be overcome. Whether it is national unification or the happiness of the people, as long as we strive and struggle according to this truth and faith, there is no reason why we cannot achieve our goals. As long as we have such confidence, we can be a hundred times more courageous in any dangerous and painful environment. Our country and our nation will naturally be reborn from the joint struggle and sacrifice of all our compatriots, and become a greater country and a more glorious nation.</p>
<p>The Jesus Christ we now commemorate, his understanding of human suffering, no one can compare with him in the past and present. His life was subjected to the most severe persecution. He was insulted by his countrymen and abandoned by his relatives and friends. If we measure Christ's career in the world by the standards of worldly success or failure, it can be said to be the greatest failure. However, his final success is so great! How brilliant it is for him to defeat those who persecuted him and slandered him in terms of justice and righteousness! We now know that his strength comes from such torment and sacrifice.

<h3>Zhang Qun Talks to Foreign Reporters; Hopes to Promote Asian Prosperity</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] President of the Executive Yuan Zhang Qun met with Vice President Fang En of United Press alone on the 20th, saying that China supports close economic and political cooperation among Asian countries to promote peace and security in the Far East and the world. Zhang also said that there are many overseas Chinese in various parts of the Far East, and the Chinese government can use this to promote a "stable and prosperous situation" in Asia.</p>
<p>Zhang said that the Chinese government maintains close relations with the US Embassy in Nanjing and the State Department in Washington on the matter of US aid to China. The Chinese government is not yet aware of the nature of US policy.</p>
<p>Zhang said that Foreign Minister Wang, on his way home, stopped in Tokyo and exchanged views with General MacArthur on the Japanese peace treaty. China's policy on the Japanese peace treaty remains unchanged from what was announced last month.</p>
<p>Zhang revealed that China plans to establish diplomatic relations with Brazil in the near future, so that Sino-Brazilian relations will be no different from those with other countries. Zhang hopes that this will strengthen economic and policy ties between China and India.</p>
<p>Zhang was wearing a gray suit and used both Chinese and English during the conversation. Those who visited Zhang with him included Gao Erya, the new China manager of United Press, Ke Guanmeng, the manager of the Nanjing branch, and reporter Zhang Guoxin.</p>
<h3>Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Provincial Assemblies Successively Elect Supervisory Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hefei, 20th] The Anhui Provincial Assembly held a general meeting to elect Supervisory Committee members at 9:00 AM on the 20th. Fifty-five provincial assembly members attended, including provincial assembly members from both the Min and Qing parties. Most of the fifteen candidates (including seven women) personally attended. Provincial Chairman Li Pinxian served as the election supervisor. After delivering a speech, the meeting closed, and the voting was scheduled for the 26th, and the results of the vote will be announced. Each candidate is stepping up off-site activities to win votes.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st] The Zhejiang Supervisory Committee election was held here for the first time on the afternoon of the 21st. Nine of the fifteen new assembly members from the Min and Qing parties also participated. All assembly members gave them a round of applause and welcome, especially Ms. Zhang Xinsheng of the Youth Party, who attracted attention from the entire venue.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 21st] The Supervisory Yuan's Supervisory Committee members, Jiangsu Province, stipulates that five people (four men and one woman) will be elected.

<p>[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang News] The temporary meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly to elect Supervisory Yuan Supervisory Committee members is about to open (this month, the 23rd). The competition among the candidates is becoming increasingly fierce. However, the current Supervisory Committee member Wu Nanxuan, although he was recommended by the Yuan to the Central Government, and was legally nominated as a candidate by five provincial assembly members, Bao Guizao, Bao Mingshu, Tang Ju, Chen Guiqing, and Zhang Jingli, Wu did not want to participate. It is now heard that he has sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Election Supervision Office, formally declaring his abandonment of the election.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Substitute Candidates Make Requests to the Central Authorities</h3>

<h3>US Aid to China Association Formulates Work Plan for Next Year; Hopes Children's Welfare Experts Will Go to the United States for Research</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] The United China Relief is the largest private organization in the United States aimed at helping China help itself. Although the results of the association's fundraising activities this year were not very good, it has now formulated a plan to promote work in China in 1948. The association issued an end-of-year statement saying: The plan for 1948 includes continuing to promote child care, medical and health, education, and social welfare work, and expanding the work of its seven member organizations, namely, the United China Relief, the China Industrial Cooperative Association, the Mass Education Movement Committee, the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the Friends Ambulance Unit, the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, and Church World Service. The United China Relief's plan depends entirely on the amount of funds raised by the American Committee for Foreign Aid next year. The special plans that the association intends to expand, in terms of social welfare, is to expand the United China Relief's work in training children's welfare talents, hoping that ten Chinese children's welfare experts can come to the United States for further study next year. In terms of mass education, expand the economic and social reconstruction work currently being carried out by the Mass Education Movement Committee in Bishan, Sichuan. The Bishan experiment will continue to be implemented in other locations next year. It is hoped that in the year 48, more than one-third of the areas in Sichuan can implement this experiment. In terms of medical and health, the plan for next year has not yet been completed. Currently under study is the China Medical Association's request for funds to print books on medicine, establish public health departments in various private universities, and engage in pre-medical rescue training programs. In terms of education, the association hopes to increase the amount of scholarships to allow Chinese university professors to come to the United States for further study in the coming year. This year, a total of ten scholarships were awarded to Christian universities. The plan for next year is to send some equipment to various Christian schools and do our best to improve the salaries and improve the lives of teachers and staff. Regarding the industrial cooperatives, the plan for next year is to maintain the current industrial cooperatives and training schools. The plan to expand the industrial movement will not proceed until China's economic situation improves.</p>

<h3>Bandits Attempt to Harass the Dahongshan Area; Military Situation in Northern Hubei Gradually Becomes Tense; National Army in Eastern Henan Meets on the Tongxu and Kaifeng Roads</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Hankou, 21st] The military situation in northern Hubei is slightly tense. The signs of communist bandits harassing the Dahongshan area are becoming more and more obvious.

<h3>Many Factories and Mines in the Northeast Are Shut Down Due to Lack of Coal and Electricity and Loss of Communication; Sun Yueqi Arrives in Peiping and Says That the Transportation of Machines South Is Not Accurate</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] The mines of the National Resources Commission have become satellites of Shenyang, isolated and losing contact with each other. The textile, paper, cement, and oil refining factories in Liaoning are closed due to lack of coal and electricity. There is a severe shortage of food and funds in the mines. For example, Anshan and Benxi only have enough food for a few days, and Fuxin and Beipiao need to have banknotes airdropped to maintain them. It is particularly heartbreaking that the employees who escaped from the Yantai coal mine do not have time to be rescued. Looking at the mines, they are full of scars. The problem in the future is not a production problem but a survival problem.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Peiping, 21st] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the National Resources Commission, arrived in Peiping by military plane from Shenyang at 6:00 PM today. Sun met with reporters and said: The maintenance of industries and mines in the Northeast is extremely difficult. During his month or so in Shenyang, in addition to inspecting the mines and factories to express his spiritual comfort to the employees working hard, he also discussed the issue of maintaining industrial and mining strongholds with Director Chen Jian many times. Chen understood the difficulties very well and promised to do his best to protect the industries and mines, but sometimes it was impossible due to factual constraints. The rumors that he arranged for the dismantling of important machines before the freeze and transporting them south are completely inaccurate. In fact, it is not possible. At present, each factory and mine still has 120,000 to 130,000 employees, with staff accounting for one-tenth, and there is no problem in controlling the workers. Sun also talked about the situation of each factory and mine, saying: Fushun can still generate 30,000 kilowatts, transmit 4,000 kilowatts to Pan, and use more than 3,000 tons of coal, but it is encountering economic bankruptcy and serious engineering risks; Benxi is isolated, and its second power plant has recently been completed, generating a total of 10,000 kilowatts; Anshan has been trapped, and some of the inventory has been shipped out first. Now due to the lack of coal, only part of the work is being done, and steelmaking has been stopped. The five locomotives and 100 carriages produced by the Fanyang Locomotive Factory have been sold to the Ministry of Transportation for cash, and two more machines are now being made; the personnel of the Fuxin mine are all trapped inside, and the personnel of Beipiao have arrived in Jinzhou. The Dalinghe Paper Mill was destroyed in this battle. Sun will stay in Peiping for four or five days before returning south.</p>
<h3>Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Disguised as Grain Merchants Are Active Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line; Military Authorities Order Strict Precautions</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 21st] In order to spy on our military and political situation, the bandits in northern Jiangsu have recently disguised themselves as grain merchants and transported food such as rice, wheat, and soybeans to major cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line for activities. The military authorities have telegraphed each county and city to take strict precautions. In addition, in order to suppress grain prices in various counties and prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to stir up unrest, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially ordered each county to pay attention to this matter.</p>
<h3>Shenyang Outskirts Within a Hundred Miles Free of Bandits; Liaoxi Contends for Xinlitun; Zheng Dongguo Again Visited the Chairman Yesterday to Receive Instructions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Shenyang 21st Dispatch] Shenyang still heard artillery fire from afar before dawn on the 21st. The weather is getting better, and the sound of planes is incessant, with frequent sorties. However, food prices are soaring, causing considerable hardship for the people. A major battle is brewing in the Xinmin area, with the bandits continuing to concentrate forces in the region. The bandit 9th Column is already near Xinmin, the 4th Column is detouring south of Shenyang, the 3rd Column is advancing westward from Zhonggu in northern Liaoning, and the 1st Column is attempting to approach Xinmin from the north via Tongjiangkou in a roundabout way. The 10th Column is currently in the Zhangwu and Faku area, and the 8th Column is fiercely attacking Xinlitun west of Xinmin, attempting to seize Xinlitun and then advance on Xinmin. In this way, there will be five columns of bandit forces, and it is expected that a major battle will occur within the week.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Fierce fighting for Xinlitun is in progress, with the National Army now gaining the upper hand. Furthermore, Beizhen (north of Goubangzi) was recaptured by the National Army at 8:00 AM on the 20th, with the remaining bandits fleeing in disarray. There are no longer any bandit traces in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Qingyang 21st Dispatch] The bandit 19th Division and other units, which invaded the outskirts of Qianyang and the Buddhist Temple (35 kilometers north of Shenyang), have suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by the National Army. They have scattered and fled towards Jiumen and other places on the north bank of the Liao River. The National Army is currently pursuing the remaining bandits. In addition, scattered bandits near the Shahe Railway Station (30 kilometers south of Shenyang) have also been surrounded by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] There are no bandit traces within 50 kilometers of the outskirts of Fanyang. The heroic National Army has been swiftly defeating stubborn enemies in recent days, giving great excitement to the military and civilians here. The Shenyang Northern National Army, pursuing and suppressing the remaining bandits, has now crossed the frozen Liao River and recovered Jiumen (60 kilometers north of Panbei). Scattered bandits near Shahe Railway Station, 30 kilometers south of Shenyang, have suffered heavy casualties after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, and their remnants are fleeing south and northwest of the area. National Army units from Liaoyang and Fushun have dispatched troops to create a screen, joining forces at Huazigou, 20 kilometers northeast of Liaoyang. The remnants of the bandit 4th Column are fleeing westward along a long line, and the National Army is currently intercepting them in the Shen Danbao area (20 kilometers east of Liaoyang).</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Beiping 21st Dispatch] It is reported that a strong force from the Training and Conscription Department again passed through the Beining Line yesterday to reinforce the Northeast. The Ping-Yu trains on the Beining Line were running smoothly yesterday and today, and rumors of another interruption are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Nanjing 21st Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo again visited the Chairman at 10:00 AM on the 21st to receive instructions regarding the Northeast war situation.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>America's Long-Term Aid to Europe Plan</h3>
<p>After the U.S. Congress finally completed the legislation for the emergency foreign aid plan, it adjourned on the 19th and will reconvene on January 6th of next year. President Truman, in the last moment before the congressional adjournment, proposed a long-term aid to Europe plan, a document of over nine thousand words. Besides explaining that the U.S. assistance to European countries' reconstruction is fully in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, it also pointed out the conditions attached to the U.S. aid to European countries. President Truman's article, although to be left for Congress to discuss next year, has significant implications and is indeed a major event in international politics at the end of 1947. Britain, France, and other countries have expressed enthusiastic welcome, and it can be seen as the starting point for the transition from 1947 to 1948.</p>
<p>The U.S. aid to Europe's reconstruction plan was first proposed by Secretary of State Marshall in a speech at Harvard University on June 15th. Initially, it held great hope to include the Soviet Union as one of the recipient countries. However, the result of the Paris Conference was that not only did the Soviet Union resolutely oppose the U.S. aid, but some small countries under Soviet control also refused to accept U.S. aid. Therefore, the U.S. aid to Europe plan fell into a state of stagnation and has not been materialized until now. In these five or six months, we have only seen the preliminary work of the U.S. President Truman appointed three committees to study U.S. resources and its ability to aid Europe, and sent Harry to investigate the actual needs of Europe. Later, Harry submitted a report arguing that the aid to Europe fund should be between 12 billion and 17 billion U.S. dollars. Secretary of State Marshall, based on estimates from various parties, announced on November 10th that the aid to Europe fund should be between 16 billion and 20 billion U.S. dollars. The Economic Cooperation Committee organized by sixteen European countries submitted a report to the U.S. government in late September, stating that if the U.S. could assist in their reconstruction, the sixteen European countries could do the following four things: Strive to increase production; Try to maintain the stability of domestic finance and fiscal policy; Ensure that all countries continue to cooperate; Increase exports to the U.S. In this way, Europe can be self-sufficient within four years without relying on aid from other countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the call for U.S. aid to Europe has been clamorous, it has been delayed in implementation. The economic crises in Western European countries, especially Italy and France, are becoming increasingly dangerous. If comprehensive assistance is not provided immediately, economic instability will inevitably lead to political turmoil. President Truman, aware of this, decided to convene a special session of Congress to discuss the emergency aid to Europe plan. Congress convened a special session on November 16th, and President Truman immediately sent a message to Congress requesting an appropriation of 597 million U.S. dollars as an emergency aid fund for France, Italy, and Austria. After a month of intense discussion, this emergency foreign aid bill was finally amended and passed by both houses and has been signed into law by President Truman. Although there are differences from the original plan, there are no major discrepancies. However, Europe cannot be reconstructed solely with this emergency foreign aid bill. Therefore, President Truman went a step further and proposed this long-term aid to Europe plan, advocating an appropriation of 15.1 billion to 17 billion U.S. dollars to aid sixteen European countries for a period of four years, ensuring that all sixteen European countries can be reconstructed, thereby guaranteeing that a third world war will never happen. Therefore, no matter from which perspective we observe, this long-term aid to Europe plan will have a very significant impact on the development of the U.S. political situation and the trends of the entire world situation in the future. It is indeed worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the world situation, the U.S. long-term aid to Europe plan seems to be America's generosity, not hesitating to use tens of billions of dollars to aid the reconstruction of sixteen European countries, thereby guaranteeing that a third world war will not happen. However, in reality, it has other functions: First, to stabilize the economy of Western Europe, so that the sixteen European countries can be economically self-sufficient and will not encounter the hardship of starvation again. In this way, each country can maintain its independence and integrity, and will not fall under the control of other countries. Second, to avoid economic panic in the U.S. It is well known that the foundation of U.S. economic prosperity is entirely based on its overseas markets. "The world is poor while America is rich alone" is absolutely impossible. If an economic panic occurs in Europe, it will inevitably affect U.S. industry and commerce. Now the economies of the sixteen European countries are on the verge of bankruptcy. If the U.S. does not provide timely assistance to turn the tide, an economic panic in the U.S. will eventually occur one day. In other words, the U.S. must help European countries recover in order to avoid economic panic at home. Therefore, some say that U.S. aid to Europe is equivalent to self-help, which has considerable reason.</p>
<p>However, the crux of today's world problems, in a nutshell, lies in the incompatibility between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The only winning card in the Soviet Union's hand is to wait for an economic panic to occur in the world. Once an economic panic occurs in Europe, the Soviet Union's forces can take advantage of the situation, and the Soviet Union's ambitions can continue to shift westward. If the U.S. suffers a recession due to the economic panic in Europe, the Soviet Union will not find it difficult to defeat the U.S. On the other hand, the U.S., with its current manpower and material resources, has more than enough to deal with the Soviet Union. However, what the U.S. fears most is an economic panic. If the European economy cannot recover, there is no peace to speak of, let alone permanent peace. If, unfortunately, the huge wave of the world economic panic spreads to the U.S., the U.S. will be overwhelmed and will be forced to give up its responsibility to lead the world in creating peace. Therefore, between the U.S. and the Soviet Union today, not only has a "cold war" broken out, but also the so-called "economic war" has become increasingly fierce. The battlefield for both sides is in Europe today. The U.S. wants to help Europe and prevent an economic panic in Europe, but the Soviet Union wants to obstruct it by any means. The Soviet Union suddenly organized a new Communist International in Warsaw, with the purpose of inciting the people of European countries to unanimously oppose U.S. aid, so that the U.S. aid to Europe plan cannot be realized. The Soviet Union also adopted an uncompromising attitude in the recent London Foreign Ministers Conference, even causing the four foreign ministers to break up unhappily, with the effect of obstructing the unification and reconstruction of the European economy. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's currency reform this time also contains the effect of strengthening the Soviet economic bloc. Therefore, the proposal of the U.S. long-term aid to Europe plan will inevitably cause a backlash from the Soviet Union. It is expected that the political struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will become more heated.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the U.S. domestic political situation, if President Truman's proposal can be passed by Congress and effectively implemented, it will not only revive the European economy, but also avoid a U.S. economic panic. Then President Truman's achievements can be compared with those of the late President Roosevelt. In next year's presidential election, Truman will have such a large capital, and victory is within reach. Truman's intention must be seen through by the Republican Party, so it is expected that after Congress reconvenes in January next year, the U.S. party struggle will inevitably become more acute.</p>
<h3>The Chairman's Christmas Broadcast Speech (Continued from Page 1)</h3>
<p>In the past decade, our compatriots throughout the country have tasted the pain of war and banditry, and have recognized the true meaning of national hardship and difficulty. Our country has suffered such incalculable destruction, our nation has been subjected to such vicious slander, our motives have been misunderstood, and our lives and actions have even been maliciously propagandized and exaggerated to have no trace of fact. Our government, officers, soldiers, and civil servants have been openly insulted in the country and abroad by those who undermine unity, regardless of national independence and freedom—traitors, communist bandits, and others—using various despicable propaganda methods to injure the personality of our entire nation.</p>
<p>Must Pay the Price</p>
<p>But these immoral and shady, treacherous environments cannot discourage us. Because we know that these insults are the price we must pay in building a greater and more perfect Christian, people-owned, people-governed, people-enjoyed, Three Principles of the People, New China. If there were no painful and dark side, there would be no such thing as happiness and light in life. We know that the nation and the people, in such a tragic ordeal, have received true refinement. Our pain gives us the vitality and experience of rebirth, which will enable our nation to overcome all the current difficulties and reach the end of victory.</p>
<p>With this understanding, this belief, we can see Jesus Christ, who has endured all hardships and finally won victory, standing before us, acting as a bright light guiding our country, encouraging our rebirth.</p>
<p>Christians in China and around the world, watching all mankind after the war revolving in a wave of widespread disappointment and moral depravity, all feel very depressed and pessimistic. In the past, in times of war and suffering, people were still able to continue to support themselves and fight to the end because they idealized a more perfect world. But now, people everywhere are wondering what work we can do in this world, which is still full of war and conquest and the idea of endurance, to ensure human happiness and world peace, and to realize our inherent ideals?</p>
<p>The Central Question of Our Time</p>
<p>Christians should have an answer to this central question of our time.</p>
<p>I think this answer can be found in human nature. People often become disappointed because their ideals have not been achieved. This is because their personalities cannot withstand the tempering of history, so they often repeat the same mistakes they have made before, and the same sins of the past reappear in an intensified form. People seem to be doomed to be forever trapped in a vortex of baseness and selfishness, unable to transcend. Is there a way for us to transcend this unfortunate fate? I can answer with certainty: "Of course there is." Christianity shows us a path. Christianity believes that human nature can be improved. This faith is the pointer to the future of human hope, and it is also the transformation of the world that must start with the improvement of people's hearts. If we have a better life, we will naturally have a more perfect world. If we do not cheer up because of the threat of sin and the rampant spread of sin in the world, and gradually become mentally depressed, physically and mentally numb, and even abandon ourselves, then it is because we lack faith in life. And this faith is the greatest lesson that Jesus Christ gives us, and it is also the greatest power. This is really the main vitality for us to overcome all sins. Jesus Christ said, "As long as you have faith like a mustard seed, your power can move mountains and overturn the sea." The world and mankind today are struggling under the pressure of pain and sin. The world needs this kind of faith very much, and Jesus Christ is the one who brings this faith to our wandering and pessimistic world to save us from human suffering.</p>
<p>The Dawn of a New Opportunity</p>
<p>When I think of this year's Christmas, I think of our China starting to implement the new democratic constitution on this festive day. I think this commemoration is very precious. The 36th year of the Republic of China, that is, the Christmas of 1947, the year of Jesus' birth, will be the day when our Republic of China and all its people are unified, independent, equal, free, and the dawn of a new opportunity begins. The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to give all our compatriots the basic elements of Christian principles, namely personal dignity and freedom, universally. This new constitution confirms the various freedoms and rights of the people of the whole country. It is conceived and born in the spirit of a free people under national unity and freedom.</p>
<p>We believe that the implementation of the new constitution is only the first step in completing our ultimate goal of building a New China. But this is an epoch-making progress for our China's three thousand years of autocratic political system and feudal society. I hope that our compatriots across the country will work together with faith and piety. I believe that we will soon be able to complete our predetermined journey, which is the completion of the establishment of our New China based on the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of what I want to contribute and hope for to our compatriots across the country and people of the world this Christmas. (The End)</p>
<h3>Papal Nuncio Launches 140 Bishops to Hold Special Prayers for Me</h3>
<p>[United Press Nanjing 21st] The Papal Nuncio, Libero, today sent a letter to 140 bishops stationed in China, requesting them to hold special prayers for China on Christmas. It is said that the Japanese Church solemnly celebrates the birth of Christ, and is very gratified that it coincides with China's implementation of the new constitution. Chinese Catholics cannot ignore this major event, because at that time, the Chinese people will begin a new era. Our responsibility is to ask Christ to bestow peace and prosperity on this noble country, and to lead it to follow the right path to gain freedom and happiness.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 21st Dispatch] The Guangdong Provincial Assembly, in order to thoroughly investigate the corruption case of the Guangdong Relief Sub-bureau, has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request a thorough investigation, and listed the following evidence of corruption in the bureau: (A) monopolizing transportation, falsely reporting losses, and colluding with merchants to steal and sell supplies, worth 1 billion yuan six months ago.

<h3>Verdict Text of Three War Criminals in the Murder Competition: Mukai, Noda, Tanaka</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Mukai Toshiaki, Noda Takeshi, and Tanaka Gunkichi, the Japanese war criminals involved in the Nanjing Massacre murder competition case, were each sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on the 18th of this month. The full text of the verdict is as follows: Verdict of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense: Defendant Mukai Toshiaki, male, 36 years old, from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, artillery squad leader. Noda Takeshi (i.e., Noda Iwao), 35 years old, from Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, adjutant of the Toyama Battalion of the 16th Division of the Japanese Army. Tanaka Gunkichi, male, 43 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, company commander of the 45th Regiment of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army.</p>
<p>The right defendants, due to war crimes, were prosecuted by the prosecutor of this court, and this court rules as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Mukai Toshiaki, Noda Iwao, and Tanaka Gunkichi, during the war, jointly and deliberately slaughtered prisoners of war and non-combatants, and are each sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao, during the war, belonged to the Nakajima Unit of the 16th Division of the Japanese Army, serving as second lieutenant squad leader and adjutant respectively. Tanaka Gunkichi belonged to the Tani Hisao Unit of the 6th Division, serving as a captain company commander. During the battle to attack Nanjing in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), due to encountering strong resistance from our army, they harbored resentment and carried out a planned massacre to vent their anger. Tanaka Gunkichi used a "Joseon sword" in the southwestern suburbs of Nanjing to kill more than 300 prisoners of war and non-combatants. Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao held a competition for entertainment in the foothills of Zijin Mountain, competing on the number of people killed. Each wielded sharp blades, killing anyone they encountered, regardless of age. As a result, Noda Iwao stabbed to death 105 people, while Mukai Toshiaki won by killing 106 people. After Japan's surrender, Noda Iwao and others were successively arrested in Tokyo by the Allied Headquarters and sent to Nanjing by our delegation to Japan for investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor of this court.</p>
<p>Reasoning</p>
<p>The facts that the defendants Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao, during the battle to attack Nanjing, held a competition in the foothills of Zijin Mountain to massacre prisoners of war and non-combatants, and that Noda Iwao killed a total of 105 people, while Mukai Toshiaki won by killing 106 people, were detailed in "Japanese Atrocities Documented" by the foreign reporter Timperley, who was in Nanjing at the time. This aligns with the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" seized by the Chinese Prosecutor's Office of the Far East International Military Tribunal, which reported on how the defendants held a "killing one hundred people" competition in Zijin Mountain and how, after completing the massacre and exceeding the record, they each raised their bloody swords, smiled at each other, and discussed the outcome. There are also corroborating photographs of the defendants holding their murder weapons to flaunt their military prowess, labeled "Two officers competing in the killing of one hundred people." Furthermore, the confirmed verdict of Tani Hisao, the already convicted defendant in the Nanjing Massacre case, states that the Japanese army scattered inside and outside the city, launching a large-scale massacre, including a killing competition, which refers to the crimes of the defendants Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao. At that time, more than 190,000 of our captured soldiers and civilians were collectively killed and their bodies burned to eliminate evidence, and more than 150,000 people were killed sporadically, with their remains buried by charity groups. These are all facts confirmed by the confirmed verdict based on conclusive evidence, and this court unearthed thousands of skulls at the burial sites as evidence. Considering all of the above in conjunction, the defendants Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao are accomplices in the Nanjing Massacre and there is absolutely no doubt about it. However, the defendants, knowing that there was nothing to deny, claimed that the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" was falsely reporting, specifically to praise the defendants' military prowess in order to win the favor of Japanese women, hoping to find good spouses soon. However, during the war, the Japanese authorities paid great attention to the control and inspection of military news, and the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" was an important Japanese publication. If the defendants had not engaged in this killing competition, there would have been no reason to fabricate a story and dedicate a large amount of space to promote the defendants. Moreover, the publication of the news has been confirmed by this court using the above-mentioned conclusive evidence and cannot be compared to ordinary misreporting. It can be used as the basis for the judgment, and the claim that using the brutal and animalistic act of killing as a competition could be used as a marriage advertisement to win the favor of women is unprecedented in modern human history. All of their defenses are untenable. Next, Tanaka Gunkichi, the defendant, was a direct subordinate of Tani Hisao, the already convicted defendant. He admitted that he carried his "Joseon sword" and participated in the massacre when Tani Hisao captured Nanjing. The enemy leader Tani Hisao and others often led their troops in a massacre in our capital that was appalling and lasted for more than ten days, killing more than 300,000 people. There is not only the confirmed verdict of this court's 36th year Criminal Trial No. 1, but it is also a fact known to the world. Since the defendant Tanaka Gunkichi was in the position of a direct subordinate of Tani Hisao, carried a knife and participated, and more than 300 of our captured soldiers and civilians died under the defendant's "Joseon sword in the chaotic slaughter, there is evidence in the book "Imperial Soldiers" compiled by Japanese military officer Yamanaka Gakutaro, which published a photo of the defendant's military knife, labeled "Captain (referring to Tanaka Gunkichi) who has cut down 300 people, beloved sword Joseon," and there is also a photo of the defendant personally wielding his knife to kill civilians, which can be used as evidence. There is no doubt that he is one of the accomplices who carried out the killings in the Nanjing Massacre. Although he argued that the person photographed was wearing a shirt, indicating it was summer, while the capture of Nanjing was in winter, indicating that the photo could only prove that he had chopped down one person in another place, regardless of whether, to facilitate movement, it is common to remove outer clothing, even in winter, during vigorous chopping. It is not allowed to cling to this in an attempt to evade responsibility, and his participation in the Nanjing Massacre has been corroborated by numerous pieces of evidence, as mentioned above, and there is no room for further cunning explanations. According to the defendants' continuous massacre of prisoners of war and non-combatants, which violates the Hague Land Warfare Regulations and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, it should constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Their view of slaughtering civilians as military prowess and using killing as a competition for entertainment is extremely brutal, cruel, and unparalleled. They are truly pests of mankind and enemies of civilization. If they are not severely punished according to the law, how can we maintain discipline and uphold morality? Therefore, they are each sentenced to the most severe penalty to serve as a warning.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with the Hague Land Warfare Regulations Article 4 Paragraph 2, Article 23 Paragraph 3, Article 46 Paragraph 1, Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War Article 2, Article 3, War Crimes Trial Ordinance Article 1, Article 2 Paragraph 2, Article 3 Paragraph 1, Article 11, Criminal Law Article 28, Article 56 Forepart, Article 57, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3>French Interior Minister Moch Issues Warning, Crisis in Europe Still Lurks, Beware of the International Communist Spring Offensive</h3>
<p>[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] British Labour Party leaders predict that before the spring, the Communist Party will launch a strike offensive in Western Europe, and Britain will also be affected by the unrest at that time. Reports from Europe show that the Communist Party's plans to disrupt the French economy have not been completely defeated, and the serious struggle in Italy has not even begun. The general impression is that the Communist Party's strength in Italian trade unions is stronger than in France, but so far, it has not been fully deployed. Communist leaders have stated that the recent general strike in France has had a lasting effect on the French economy, and even with temporary assistance from the United States, workers will be able to raise the issue of wages again in three months.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Paris 21st Dispatch] French new Interior Minister Moch met alone with Associated Press reporters today, on the bloody labour unrest and riots that occurred in France and Italy last month he said, "This is obviously an international" attack against the Marshall Plan. European Communist parties are following the orders of the Communist Information Bureau, launching illegal acts to disrupt the economies and normal lives of their respective countries, so that when the Marshall Plan is implemented, the plan will be completely ineffective. Moch firmly believes that the recent difficulties in France are not a rehearsal for a civil war, but a general rehearsal for the next civil war. Through this conflict, the Communist Party can train its troops, such as the commando teams in the north and Marseille. The Communist Party was given strict orders to only use stones and iron bars, and not to use weapons, so this was not a military action. Moch continued, the French government has learned of the plans that the French Communist Party, the Communist Information Bureau, and the Italian Communist Party are about to implement in unison. The French Communist Party believes that the democratic French government will not be able to take strong and swift action to deal with this move, and the French Communist Party expects that the French government will either collapse or agree to the demands of the strikers." Moch also said that the French Communist Party's failure had three reasons: First, the French government took swift and powerful actions throughout the country and in parliament, and parliament had to pass special bills to deter sabotage. Second, the working class is very sophisticated and no longer blindly follows the Communist Party's lead. Third, the Minister of Labour never closed the door to negotiations with the General Confederation of Labour. Moch believes that the French Communist Party will definitely make a comeback, and more riots may break out in February and March of next year when vegetable and meat prices are particularly high.</p>
<h3>France Willing to Negotiate with Occupying Powers at Any Time to Seek a Solution to the German Problem, French Parliament Debates New Financial Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris 21st Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bidault declared at a closed meeting of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee today that France is willing to negotiate with other occupying powers on the future of Germany at any time, and a beneficial solution can be obtained, but our actions are completely free, and our general position and goals will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 21st Dispatch] The National Assembly began debating today the plan proposed by Finance Minister Mayer to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Communist Party members issued serious attacks. Communist Party member Leger denounced it as a system that exploits the working class and sternly rebuked Mayer, "You are more willing to win the trust of American banking tycoons than the trust of the French people." Another Communist Party member, Clua said that this plan will definitely not work, because repressive measures will never win broad support.</p>
<h3>Soviet Fleet Strength Enhanced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington 20th Dispatch] A publication of the U.S. Navy Department said that the Soviet fleet is growing rapidly, but pointed out that many of the ships held by the Soviet Union are quite old. The Navy Department's official magazine said that the Soviet fleet has become stronger than before as a result of this war. It is said that the information obtained shows that the Soviet Union has four major fleets: the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, as well as small fleets in the Caspian Sea and internal rivers. It also said that the Soviet Union has begun planning to build warships in recent years and has obtained ships from Allied countries and defeated enemy countries. The Soviet Union already has a submarine fleet, including high-speed submarines obtained from Germany under an agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States at the end of the war. It is said that the Soviet Union is building ships and giant destroyers in Vladivostok in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Division of Warships to the Soviet Union and France</h3>
<p>[Reuters Rome 20th Dispatch] The Four-Power Naval Committee has submitted to the Italian government a list of warships that Italy must hand over to the Soviet Union and France in accordance with the peace treaty. According to the definition of the peace treaty, Italy should hand over 30 warships to the four powers, including the 35,000-ton battleships Italy and Vittorio Veneto, and the 13,000-ton battleship Caesar.

<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] On the day the last contingent of American troops stationed in Italy withdrew from the country on the 15th of this month, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi telegraphed President Truman, saying, "On this day when all Allied forces are withdrawing from Italian territory, I would like to express to Your Excellency that the Italian people will never forget the Allied forces' action in liberating Italy and the spirit of fighting alongside the Allied forces."</p>
<p>President Truman replied, "I am deeply aware that the Italian government and people are determined to safeguard the freedom they have obtained. The people of our country are wholeheartedly pleased to learn that Italy is jointly defending freedom and democracy with other peace-loving nations in the world."</p>
<h3>The Open and Covert Struggles Between Eastern and Western Powers; Future Trends Worth Watching; Rumor of Stalin Reprimanding the Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 21st] The diplomatic correspondent of the London "People's Daily" reported that after Molotov returned to the country, Stalin convened a special meeting of the Politburo to severely reprimand Molotov for failing to prevent the breakdown of the Four-Power London Conference. Stalin also firmly demanded a thorough investigation into the causes of the failure. Other senior Soviet officials also heavily criticized Molotov's actions during the meeting. The newspaper's correspondent speculated that, due to this development, the Soviet Union might adopt a slightly more conciliatory approach in diplomacy at its next meeting with Western countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] The crossroads of the major powers' relationships has reached its most obvious point since the end of the war, but future developments are still in a stage of speculation. Since the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, neither the United States nor the Soviet Union has revealed its intention for its next action. The question today is whether to continue trying to maintain the framework of Allied cooperation or to declare the failure of cooperation to the world. Future developments will depend on the outcome of the open struggle between the two opposing systems. Only the decision-makers in Moscow and Washington know whether they are prepared to abandon the common goals of the Allies. Outsiders have no way of obtaining any indication until one of the four powers takes a diplomatic initiative. The talks given by Bevin and Bidault in London show that London or Paris will not take such an initiative before the New Year. Representatives of the Foreign Ministers discussing the Austrian issue are scheduled to meet before February 1 to listen to the latest Soviet proposals. If the four powers still have a month to deliberate, we can start from the existing international agreements and find the following possibilities: None of the major powers will take formal steps to end or replace the Foreign Ministers' Conference mechanism, but this will not prevent Western countries or the Soviet Union from developing the current system in their occupied areas. The discussion of the three Western powers on coordinating the policies of the three western zones of Germany will be held without the future mission of the Foreign Ministers' Conference being determined. The way in which the three powers discuss and the selection of participants are of great significance, as the Soviet Union's opposition will inevitably be based on this method and level. One of the four powers will take the initiative to demand the end of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Since the agreement reached by the major powers on the basis of a peace treaty has faced bankruptcy, one or more powers may decide to submit this entire matter to a higher authority, such as the United Nations organization. One of the three powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, invokes the Yalta Agreement to convene a three-power conference, so that the relations between the powers can be brought back on track outside the Foreign Ministers' Conference. From the perspective of the above points, the first two items are at least the most likely in the near future.</p>
<h3>British Celebrities Issue an Appeal: The Three Giants Should Hold Consultations to Establish Atomic Energy Control to Avoid Catastrophe</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 20th] Ten prominent figures in Britain today issued a joint statement, urging Prime Minister Attlee and President Truman to find a way to make Stalin face up to the international tensions caused by the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' London Conference. The signatories to the declaration include Liberal Party Member of Parliament Reid, famous philosopher Lord Russell, famous educator and poet Eliot, St. Paul's Cathedral pastor Matthews, former Foreign Office adviser Lord Vansittart, and four Labour Party Members of Parliament. The declaration expressed great concern about the continued growth of communist forces in many countries, and believed that it was regrettable that after the Allied countries overthrew one form of totalitarianism after six years of great war, they only replaced it with another form of totalitarianism that was even more powerful than fascism. The declaration, while emphasizing the threat of atomic war, attributed the failure of all attempts to control atomic energy to "the Soviet Union's stubborn attitude." The declaration suggested that Attlee and Truman should make it clear to Stalin that atomic war must be avoided. The declaration further stated that if such powerful mediation fails, "all freedom-loving countries should closely liaise with Britain and the United States and act in unison to develop a transcendent defense force, including atomic power, so that no strong country dares to provoke them."</p>

<h3>Economic Conference of Sixteen European Nations Planned to Reopen Early Next Year; Rumor That Harriman Will Be Appointed President of the Aid Europe Program</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] Observers here believe that the economic conference of the sixteen European countries will reopen early next year to consider Europe's action plan based on President Truman's Aid Europe program submitted to Congress. Observers believe that this move by the sixteen European countries will be the most concrete response from Western democracies to the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Congress also feel that what interests Congress most is the report from Europe that European countries have already begun to act to abolish trade barriers and establish agreements on industrial production.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 21st] It is rumored here that former Wisconsin Senator Harriman is expected to be appointed as the president of the Marshall Aid Europe Program. When Harriman met with reporters from this agency, he declined to discuss the possibility of taking up this position, but emphasized that he was a key behind-the-scenes figure in drafting the Aid Europe plan and fully agreed with the program and management method recommended by Truman to Congress. Harriman, 51, is a member of the Harriman Committee and has close ties with the Republican Party, so he is expected to receive support from Congress.</p>

<h3>The Reason for Non-Prosecution of Li Zhuomin and Eight Others Accused of Corruption: Even if There are Inappropriate Aspects, They Fall Under Administrative Issues; Investigation Results Indicate Insufficient Evidence of Criminal Suspicion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the investigation by the District Procuratorate into the corruption case involving Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and others, Hou Aichang, Cheng Daoyi, Hu Keshi, and twelve other defendants have been prosecuted. Li Zhuomin, Lu Hanqin, Xu Shichang, Chen Guangyuan, Wang Fusheng, and nine others have not been prosecuted. The reasons for the prosecution have been published in this newspaper. The reasons for the non-prosecution of Li and others are also of interest to the public. The following is an excerpt from the original text of the non-prosecution disposition:</p>
<p>Defendant Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA); Lu Hanqin, Chief Secretary; Xu Shichang, former Director of the General Affairs Department; Chen Guangyuan, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department; Wang Fusheng, Director of the Distribution Department; Huang Weiqing, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Distribution Department; Zhang Zihui, concurrently Section Chief and Specialized Commissioner; Li Huan, Specialist of the Distribution Department; Peng Wuhuang, Section Chief of the Materials Procurement and Sales Office. Regarding the aforementioned defendants' case involving suspicion of corruption, the investigation has concluded that they should not be prosecuted. The reasons are stated as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Li Zhuomin's Part</p>
<p>Upon investigation, of the four points of suspicion of corruption against the defendant, the first point concerns the purchase, sale, transportation, and distribution of relief materials by the CRRRA. These operations were handled separately by the various responsible units within the administration and supervised by the Executive Director. The defendant's position as Deputy Director-General was merely to assist the Director-General in handling administrative affairs within the administration. This is evidenced by the CRRRA's Thirty-Fifth Year Pu Mi Zi No. 450 telegram and the CRRRA's organizational adjustment regulations. Since the defendant was not fully in charge of supervising the aforementioned operations, even if the responsible personnel had illegal conduct, the defendant could not have known everything. Therefore, the defendant's argument that he is not responsible for joint and conniving responsibility is not without merit. The second point of accusation, regarding the concealment of enemy property, the electric refrigerator, is also supported by the photograph on the fifth page of the safekeeping certificate issued by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau on January 16, Thirty-Fifth Year. Upon verification, the photograph does indeed contain a record of an electric refrigerator. Therefore, the defendant's argument that there was no possibility of concealing enemy property is credible. Although the defendant did not instruct the safekeeping personnel to affix the receiving agency's label to the borrowed enemy and puppet furniture, intending to improve the appearance, this is a different matter and is not sufficient to deem him guilty of embezzlement.</p>
<p>The third point of accusation, regarding instructing Li Rongxian of the CRRRA's Personnel Office to reimburse travel expenses, which is suspected of disrupting the system and engaging in fraud, is investigated as follows: The defendant traveled to various parts of the country for inspection five times in May and June of the Thirty-Sixth Year. The travel expenses for each trip amounted to several tens of thousands of yuan, which is not a very large sum. It has been investigated and verified by personnel dispatched by the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office, as evidenced by the original impeachment document and attached copies. The fact that Li Rongxian handled the reimbursement of travel expenses for each trip was because Li Rongxian served as the secretary of the inspection team when he participated in the inspection tour, which had nothing to do with his original position in the CRRRA. The defendant submitted five lists of inspection team members of the work team's inspection branch, a report on the work team's affairs handled by Li Rongxian, and related documents, which were verified to be correct. The defendant's argument that he did not interfere with general affairs and disrupt the system to engage in fraud is credible. As for the fourth point of accusation, regarding Liu Qingyu's illegal promotion, Liu Qingyu originally served as a specialist in the CRRRA, receiving a monthly salary of 300 yuan. Because of his diligent work, he was promoted to secretary during the year-end performance evaluation in the Thirty-Fifth Year, receiving a monthly salary of 400 yuan. This was approved by Huo Shishi, Director-General of the CRRRA, as evidenced by the photograph of the CRRRA's year-end performance evaluation certificate for Liu Qingyu in the Thirty-Fifth Year. Even if Liu Qingyu's promotion was inappropriate, it is an administrative issue, and it is difficult to hold the defendant criminally liable. In summary, the defendant's criminal suspicion is clearly insufficient. Regarding</p>
<p>Lu Hanqin's Part: The defendant is the Chief Secretary of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). Because he was new to Shanghai, and the administration did not have staff dormitories to provide accommodation, the Director-General specially approved him to temporarily stay in a hotel after his family arrived in Shanghai. From February 5 to September 5 of the Thirty-Sixth Year, he used Room 901 of the International Hotel, incurring a total of 85,264,320 yuan in legal tender. The defendant also signed through the General Affairs Department to request the Director-General's approval for renting a house, and successively allocated house repair fees and relocation fees for the previous tenant, totaling 70 million yuan in legal tender. These were all approved by the General Affairs Department and paid by the Finance Department, and were not handled by the defendant. All of these facts have been verified by reviewing the relevant files and receipts of the administration. The defendant's expenses were approved by the Director-General and paid by the Finance Department according to law. Even if the expenses were excessive, it is a different matter. The suspicion that the defendant sought to benefit himself is insufficient. Regarding</p>
<p>Xu Shichang's Part: The initial accusation against the defendant, who is a specialized commissioner and the director of the General Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, is that he engaged in fraud by cutting white printing paper. Upon questioning, the defendant stated: "The white printing paper was surplus material from the U.S. military, and the sizes had already been cut. There were no large-sized papers (i.e., large papers), only self-typing paper, which had to be cut into smaller sizes. We received 355 reams of white typing paper, issued 170 reams, paid to cut 85 reams, and still had 100 reams. The part that was paid to cut was cut into 100,000 sheets, each 8 inches wide and 10.5 inches long (i.e., one sheet cut into four sheets), and 50,000 sheets, each 8 inches wide and 13 inches long (i.e., one sheet cut into three sheets). Because the sizes cut were different, the resulting square inches were naturally different and could not be compared with each other. Moreover, the paper scraps left over from cutting were very small and could not be used. According to custom, these paper scraps were given to the paper-cutting workers." The number of white typing papers received and paid was verified by reviewing the relevant account books and found to be correct. (Omission) The defendant's argument that he did not engage in any fraud in cutting white typing paper is credible. Regarding</p>
<p>Chen Guangyuan's Part: The defendant is the Director of the Storage and Transportation Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) and the Director of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau. (Omission) The contract for managing ships, which was signed between the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau and the United Transportation Company on June 8 of the Thirty-Fifth Year, was signed before the defendant took office as the director of the bureau in September of the Thirty-Fifth Year. After the defendant took office, he discovered that the United Transportation Company was poorly managed, and changed the contract to the Jiutong Company. The relevant files of the bureau have been retrieved and verified. The Jiutong Company was established on May 14 of the Thirtieth Year and is located at Room 66, 4th Floor, 119 Yu Chi Road. The Fuxing Transportation Company was established at the end of September of the Thirty-Fourth Year and is located at Room 210, 2nd Floor, 3 East Zhongshan Road. The persons in charge of the respective companies and firms, Bai Xuchu, Kang Jingfu, and Huang Quangui, have testified to this, and their registration certificates and business licenses have been retrieved and verified. The defendant's argument that they are not fictitious names and monopolizing business is not without merit. As for the abandonment of rotten goods by the bureau, a total of 3,480 tons before September of the Thirty-Sixth Year (i.e., before the occurrence of this case), and about 300 tons after October of this year, were all appraised by experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and representatives signed the documents, and personnel were dispatched to escort them to Wusong and throw them into the Huangpu River. The files of the submerged materials of the bureau have been retrieved and verified to be true. The defendant's argument that he did not take the opportunity to embezzle materials is also credible. Regarding</p>
<p>Wang Fusheng, Huang Weiqing, Zhang Zihui, and Li Huan's Part: Defendant Wang Fusheng is the Director of the Distribution Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). Defendants Huang Weiqing and Zhang Zihui are both section chiefs of the department. Defendant Li Huan is a specialist of the department. The distribution of materials was carried out in accordance with the decisions of the Joint Distribution Committee of the CRRRA and UNRRA and its affiliated subcommittees. They could not freely dispose of the materials. The meeting minutes of the respective committees have been submitted and can be verified. The quantity of inventory materials and the actual number of goods picked up by the allocated parties were handled by special personnel in the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau and the warehouse. Even if the number of materials was inconsistent, or the personnel managing the materials were suspected of colluding and engaging in fraud, it has nothing to do with the distribution. Although defendants Wang Fusheng and others did not wait for the actual number of materials to be verified, but immediately carried out the distribution based on the assumed number notified by the Joint Committee in writing, which caused duplication problems, it was inappropriate. However, this is an administrative problem, and it is difficult to hold them criminally liable. As for defendant Li Huan, when he was being investigated regarding the situation of the sale and distribution of electric fans, he claimed that the distribution of electric fans was handled by various units, and all meeting minutes and distribution lists were kept separately by the personnel in charge, and he did not immediately try to collect them for verification, which is prone to misunderstanding, and is also inappropriate. However, since it was subsequently submitted to the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office for verification and then returned, and was submitted for investigation during the court's investigation, it is difficult to conclude that defendants Wang Fusheng and others concealed official documents and assisted in embezzlement.</p>
<p>Regarding Peng Wuhuang's Part: The defendant is the Section Chief of the Materials Procurement and Sales Office of the Finance Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and is accused of assisting in the sale of materials to seek profits. (Omission) Regarding the bidding, door sales, or suspension of sales, and the sales prices of electric fans by the Materials Procurement and Sales Office of the Finance Department of the CRRRA, the general manager of the office, Hou Aichang, was responsible for making the decisions. Hou Aichang has stated this in the investigation by the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office and the court's investigation. Regarding the fact that the Sanbei Company applied to the office in May of the Thirty-Sixth Year to purchase 400 electric fans, but because they were not practical, they sent a letter stating that they would only buy 160 fans, and the remaining 240 fans were requested to be returned, all of which were voluntary. The remaining 240 fans were purchased by Zhuang Zhenwen, the second bidder in the office's May bidding, who paid 356,000 yuan per fan according to the May bidding price. The defendant did not obstruct or solicit rewards. This has been testified to by Sun Beiping and Han Enyan, the persons in charge of the Sanbei Company. As for the Zhengyi Trading Company extracting 500 electric fans purchased through bidding, totaling 42 boxes, because there were two extra fans, the office staff directly negotiated with Miao Yuming, the person handling the matter for the company, to purchase them. Miao Yuming has also testified to this clearly in the case. However, upon investigation, only 500 fans were bid out in this bidding. The defendant sold two extra fans and allowed the office staff to purchase them, which is inconsistent with the CRRRA's regulations prohibiting staff from purchasing materials, and is therefore inappropriate. However, this is an administrative problem. Since the defendant has not been found to have evidence of profiteering, the suspicion of his crime is insufficient.</p>
<p>In summary, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, and Article 231, Item 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the disposition of non-prosecution is made.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Trunk Line by Over 7,000 Feet, Minimizing Connection Fees: Pudong Waterworks Actively Expanding Equipment</h3>
<p>The Pudong Waterworks of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities was originally managed by the Xingye Trust Company on behalf of the municipal government. During the wartime occupation of Shanghai, it was seized by the enemy and puppets. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was taken over by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities. At that time, all equipment had suffered serious damage. Since the takeover, after active reorganization, significant progress has been made in all aspects of engineering and business in the past two years. (A) Engineering Aspect: The water production and intake equipment have been repaired, water production equipment has been added, water meters have been replaced, sediment in the intake pipe has been dredged, and the trunk line has been extended along Pudong Avenue to Shiba Jianzhen and the Min Sheng Road Lan Yan Cong Pier, with a total length of 6,588 feet, which was fully completed on September 13.

<h3>Sympathizing with the Clothing Donation Movement: Mostly Lower- and Middle-Class Families; Tongji Students Running Tirelessly; Their Spirit of Perseverance is Admirable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to expand the work of donating winter clothing to relieve refugees, Tongji University students formally established the "Tongji University Donation Drive Committee" the day before yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday, and more than 300 students started working at 8 a.m., forming small groups of five people each and heading to the residents in the Hongkou District to solicit donations of winter clothing. From morning to night, they collected a great deal, totaling more than 60 quilts, more than 2,000 pieces of winter clothing, including old suits and jackets, and more than 50 pairs of shoes and 200-300 pieces of socks, scarves, etc. The donation team was originally limited to soliciting winter clothing, but many residents, because they had no old clothes to donate, contributed cash instead, raising more than 6 million yuan in one day. The committee plans to use this money to buy old clothes from used clothing stores, and transport them together with the donated winter clothing to distribute to refugees in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas at 1 p.m. this afternoon. At the same time, the donation work will continue to be carried out. According to the students who went out to solicit donations: most of those who donate old clothes or cash are from lower- and middle-class families. On the other hand, most upper-class families misunderstand, or even treat them with disdain, making the work very difficult. The committee sincerely hopes that this work can gain the widespread sympathy of the society, and that people will donate generously to benefit the suffering refugees, which would be of great significance.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At the Jin Lan brothel located at No. 36, Lane 961, North Sichuan Road, more than 20 men wearing uniforms suddenly arrived the night before last. After entering, they destroyed all the furnishings in the brothel without asking any questions, and injured the brothel owner Xie Zhongchen, the madam Li Xiaomei, and Xu Meitang with sharp weapons. After someone reported the incident, the nearby military police sent troops to the scene to suppress the situation, and arrested seven perpetrators and took them to the team for interrogation. The injured brothel owner and others were sent to the hospital. It is reported that the incident was caused by the brothel's refusal to allow some of them to solicit prostitutes for prostitution the night before.</p>
<h3>A Love Letter Causes Trouble: Female Worker Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>

She was later discovered and sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that her husband works as a bookkeeper at the No. 4 China Textile Factory at No. 141 on the same road.

<h3>Christmas is Approaching, But Stores are Quiet: Turkeys Priced at a Million; Lamentations are Heard Everywhere</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Christmas season is approaching, and Christmas gifts are displayed in the city. Due to import restrictions, turkeys are mostly supplied by the area near Dinghai, Zhejiang Province, resulting in unusually high prices, with a selling price of 120,000 yuan per pound, requiring more than a million yuan for one. Christmas trees cost from 200,000 to 1 million yuan each. Silver bells, candles, and Christmas flower baskets also require several million yuan to complete the decoration of wealthy merchants. Therefore, apart from larger stores, the windows are generally very quiet. Occasionally, some stores use Santa Claus as window display advertisements, and the bags are filled with the store's merchandise. This only makes children who linger on the street expecting Christmas gifts sigh. Apart from the usual prayer ceremonies held on Christmas morning, due to the high prices, it seems that the grand gestures of gathering large crowds to distribute candy and clothes, etc., as in previous years, will no longer be possible. The trading of Christmas gifts on West Nanjing Road and Central Linsen Road is also very sparse. Only Sullivan's is making giant Christmas cakes, styled in a Western-style two-story garden building, although it is more magnificent than usual, no one has inquired about it as of today.</p>

<p>Gift Prices Have Increased 15 Times</p>
<p>According to Yong'an Company's statistics, the company's retail sales of Christmas gifts in the week before Christmas averaged 1,200 invoices per day before the war, while now there are only about 350. The price of gifts has increased 15 times compared to before the war, which is the main reason for the sluggish trading. This year, due to the development of import and export trade, many foreigners have brought their families to establish homes in Shanghai. Recently, the American soldiers stationed in Shanghai have also welcomed their families here. Therefore, 60-70% of the buyers of Christmas gifts are them. What is particularly different about this year's Christmas toys compared to previous years is that the source of foreign goods has been cut off, and all toys are made by domestic manufacturers. The jeep toys that were popular last year have become a thing of the past, replaced by large three-wheeled army toys. Foreigners especially like to buy them in competition and send them by airmail to relatives and friends in their home countries as the only commemorative Christmas gift for living in China. The application from each dance hall to extend business hours on Christmas Eve has not yet been approved by the Bureau, so the mood is not enthusiastic. However, colorful paper hats, masks, and floral decorations are being made in a hurry. The tea fee has also been set at one times the normal price, about 140,000 to 180,000 yuan per cup. At that time, the carnival scene may still be unavoidable.</p>

<p>Private Dance Parties Will See an Increase</p>
<p>This year, because the banquets in each building are subject to conservation restrictions, many private individuals plan to invite relatives and friends to hold large-scale gatherings and dance parties at home on Christmas Eve, and enjoy themselves all night long. Therefore, it is expected that this year's private dance parties will be more grand than last year. In addition, the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe will spend the holiday in Shanghai this time. They are very interested in this day with religious significance. In order to show their celebration of the festival with the citizens of Shanghai and the foreigners stationed in Shanghai, they will choose a square to perform border songs and dances as much as possible. However, recently, the cold wave has filled the air, and in the streets of minus five degrees, refugees are crying for hunger and cold, and the number of exposed corpses has increased. The snow scene decorated with cotton wool and silver flowers in the store windows is set off against the scene, which is really heartbreaking.</p>

<h3>A Beautiful Tale of Sino-American Romance: Flying Tiger General Marries Female Journalist; Lovers Become Husband and Wife; Chennault and Anna Chennault Hold Wedding in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Former commander of the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force, Flying Tiger General Chennault (see picture), held a wedding ceremony yesterday afternoon at his private residence on Hongqiao Road in this city with Miss Anna Chennault (see picture), a reporter for the Central News Agency, officiated by Pastor Moton Shen. Few outsiders knew about this, and even close friends of both parties had not heard of it beforehand. It is learned that there were twelve guests attending the wedding of General Chen and Miss Chen yesterday. The bride was escorted into the hall by her father. The bride's stepmother and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Y.C. James Yen, were also present. The groom's best man was Colonel Frank Schiel, former pilot of the Flying Tigers, and the bride's maid of honor was her sister, Miss Cynthia Chen. It is said that the newlyweds will remain in Shanghai after the wedding.</p>
<p>General Chennault is currently 57 years old and is the world's most famous expert in bomber aviation. During the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in China, Chen was hired to come to China as an air force advisor to Chairman Chiang. He then organized the Flying Tigers with American volunteer aviators, fought in various southwestern provinces of China, and repeatedly performed meritorious deeds, being hailed as a "Friend of China." After the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the United States officially declared war on Japan, he reorganized the Flying Tigers into the Fourteenth Air Force, under Chen's command. He recently received a U.S. Navy Medal. General Chen is currently the director of the Executive Yuan's Air Transport Brigade. Miss Chen is from Guangdong Province and is currently 24 years old. During the War of Resistance, she joined the Central News Agency as a reporter in Kunming. Her acquaintance with General Chen began when she was a reporter in Yunnan. After the war, Miss Chen was transferred to Shanghai. Her interviewing skills have long been praised by all sectors of society. The lady's father was formerly the Chinese Consul in San Francisco. He recently returned to China from the United States and has been transferred to the post of Consul in Sarawak, Borneo, and will soon go to take up his new position. According to reports, there had been rumors about the mutual affection between General Chen and Miss Chen, although the lady repeatedly denied it, most friends expected their happy event to be near. Now the Sino-American marriage has truly come to fruition; it is indeed a beautiful tale.</p>
<h3>Night Navigation Lighting Equipment Newly Arrived from the United States, To Be Lit Up Starting Christmas Day</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The night navigation lighting equipment purchased by the Civil Aviation Administration from the United States has already arrived at Longhua Airport and is being installed on both sides of the newly built concrete runway immediately. It can be lit up on the 25th of this month. The lights are extremely bright, with each lamp emitting 380 watts. One lamp is installed every 300 feet along both sides of the runway, illuminating the airport brightly when all are lit. Because this equipment is too powerful and easily damaged if used frequently, it will not be used lightly under normal circumstances, but will be turned on when there is heavy fog or low visibility. From now on, aviation safety in this city will have another major guarantee.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Administration Allocates Funds to Build Airport Terminal Building</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Airports in advanced countries around the world all have airport terminal buildings. The so-called airport terminal building includes departments that handle matters related to aircraft entry and exit, such as the Civil Aviation Administration, Customs, and airlines, and is a systematic and organized arrangement. Before boarding and after disembarking, passengers must go through various departments in a clear order to complete various procedures before they can board or leave. In terms of maintaining order and saving time, airport terminal buildings are indispensable structures. Our Civil Aviation Administration considers Longhua Airport in this city to be an international airport, with frequent aircraft traffic and a focus of attention for both Chinese and foreign observers, so it allocated huge funds to build an airport terminal building. It is learned that the building has already started construction.</p>

<h3>Cracking Down on Gasoline Hoarding; Enforcement Steps Being Planned; Investigations Will Be Conducted on Oil Companies and Gas Stations</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Gasoline in this city will soon be subject to unified control. The Gasoline Allocation Committee, at its first meeting last week, in addition to determining personnel, also drafted enforcement steps on how to crack down on gasoline hoarding and black market sales. The investigation will begin by surveying the quarterly gasoline import volume allocated by the Import Quota Allocation Office, and whether oil companies and gas stations in this city are engaged in hoarding or black market sales. The amount of gasoline stored by public bus companies, taxi companies, auto repair shops, and other industrial and commercial organizations that consume gasoline must not exceed one month's consumption. Their usual import, export, and sales situation must be reported weekly and sent to the Bureau of Public Works for the Police Department to review. The two bureaus will send personnel to regularly conduct spot checks on their gasoline usage and encourage citizens to report secretly, in order to thoroughly crack down on gasoline hoarding.</p>

<h3>Securing the Central Plains</h3>
<p>[Reported from Nanjing on the 21st by this newspaper] The north wind is piercingly cold, and the weather is bitterly frozen. The battles in the icy and snowy north are probably unimaginable for people in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, the cold of the north will spread southward, and the news of the suffering in the north, at the end of this year when the temperature has already dropped below zero, is enough to stir the hearts of the capital. The Henan petitioners who recently flew to the capital to petition complained bitterly about many things on the morning of the 20th. Vice Speaker Zhang Honglie of the Provincial Senate and several representatives were extremely unwilling to make alarming statements, but the seriousness of the situation compelled them to petition.</p>
<p>Three Demands from the Bandits</p>
<p>After the Yellow River flowed into the sea through its old course in Shandong, the military situation in Shandong took a sharp turn for the worse. The bandit forces of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng both crossed the river at once, wanting to take root in Hebei, but they quickly discovered that, after years of struggle and rule, the economic foundation of the rural areas of Hebei could no longer bear the burden of these hundreds of thousands of soldiers. The well-established "Join the Army Movement" could no longer supply troops from the Hebei Plain, and the lack of food and clothing made it difficult to even get through the winter. Thus, hundreds of thousands of troops, along with Chen Geng's bandit forces, swept down from the east and west, chanting to launch the "Three Demands Movement" using hollow-center tactics, demanding clothing, food, and soldiers, ultimately wanting to take root in the Funiu Mountains and the Dabie Mountains. Unexpectedly, their attempt failed due to defeats in the border areas of Henan and Hubei and in the Wanxi region. With a shift in direction, they directly approached the heart of the Central Plains.</p>
<p>Tight Situation in Henan Province</p>
<p>"Henan is tense everywhere, especially the triangular area of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Xuchang. The combined forces of Chen Geng, Chen Yi, and Liu Bocheng are all targeting this area. This is the center of Henan, the hub of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Its gain or loss can affect the entire situation. At the same time, this is also the concentration of party, government, and military cadres in Henan. If they suffer losses, the future of Henan is unimaginable. Therefore, whether in terms of strategic geography or the preservation of talent, the value of this area is truly inestimable. The government should send reinforcements to relieve the siege, and if it can wipe out the main force of these three bandit forces in one fell swoop, the pacification of the interior will not be far off. Now, Henan is not only experiencing a tight military situation, but the existing disaster situation has also been severely affected, and food and relief funds are also urgently needed. We represent three thousand people, begging the people of the whole country to recognize the importance of the Central Plains, and earnestly requesting the government and society to provide full assistance."</p>
<p>The Suffering of the Central Plains</p>
<p>The above are all the words of Mr. Zhang. Then, everyone brought up the historical importance of the Central Plains, and everyone lamented the suffering of the Central Plains in recent years.</p>
<p>"South of the Yellow River, from Hangu Pass and Luoyang to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Shangqiu, has been the first line of defense for southern China since ancient times. Protecting these strongholds is related to the overall situation. We are not just calling out for our hometown, we are pleading for the overall situation."</p>
<p>"The Central Plains has always determined the overall situation. If the Central Plains is not protected, Wuhan and Shanghai will have no guarantee. If the Longhai and Pinghan Railways are not protected, it will be difficult to defend the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. We are by no means making alarming statements, but historical facts and the situation prove this conclusion."</p>
<p>Not Enough Attention</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, Henan contributed men and grain, protecting their homes and defending their country, doing their best. But, who dares to say that everyone has paid enough attention to the Central Plains at this moment? They believe that the situation is now urgent, but if there are three divisions of troops, the Central Plains can be secured with point-line defense, and a gradual recovery of the overall situation can be planned. Otherwise, after half a year, using this area, which is rich in grain and manpower, and employing thirty divisions of elite troops, it may be difficult to recover. They call for the rapid provision of large forces, food, relief funds, materials, and disaster relief to protect the land. (Reporter Pu Dejie)</p>

<h3>Boiler Explodes, Bricks and Stones Fly; Bengbu Power Plant is Too Old; Loud Noise, Fortunately No One Injured</h3>
<p>[Reported from Bengbu on the 18th by this newspaper] The generator in the first power plant (i.e., the old plant) of the Bengbu Power Plant, due to its old age and heavy load, suddenly exploded at about 7 p.m. on the 17th. There was a loud noise, bricks and stones flew, and hot steam billowed, creating a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, most of the firemen were gathering at the corner of the room for dinner, and the person on duty quickly broke the glass on the window and jumped out, so no one was injured. After the incident, the burst opening was inspected and found to be about three feet square, severely damaged, and impossible to repair for a while. According to the person in charge of the plant, the old plant's boiler was purchased in the ninth year of the Republic of China and is old and should have been replaced long ago. The two diesel engines purchased during the War of Resistance were taken away by the Japanese invaders during the occupation. They have not been used since the victory. The city's electricity demand has increased fivefold compared to last year, and it could not bear the load, leading to this unfortunate incident. The diesel engine purchased in Shanghai will arrive soon and can be installed and generate electricity within 20 days. It has now been decided to implement staggered power outages starting on the 19th, that is, power will be cut off once every other day. It is reported that at present, electricity is supplied daily by the second power plant (Pengxin Plant).</p>
<h3>Eight Taiwan Sugar Industry Factories Start Operations One After Another</h3>

Of the various sugar-making equipment ordered by the sugar company from the United States with US$5 million, only 20% has been obtained due to transportation difficulties. As for the issue of exporting sugar to Japan, it was initially agreed to price it at US$300 per ton, but due to the low price of Cuban sugar shipped to Japan, it will be reduced to US$200. Currently, Sugar Company General Manager Shen will go to Shanghai to negotiate the signing of this contract.</p>

<h3>Hang Liwu Returns to Beijing Via Shanghai Discusses Attendance at UNESCO Meeting Wu Youxun and Li Shuhua Still in America</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Hang Liwu, the chief representative of China's delegation to the second session of the UNESCO, traveled to the United States from Mexico after the meeting to study education. On the 18th, he returned to China from the United States by plane, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Accompanying Mr. Hang was Ju Chunong, secretary of the delegation. Representatives Wu Youxun and Li Shuhua are currently still in the United States. Mr. Hang is scheduled to return to Beijing by train this afternoon. Appearing somewhat travel-weary, he received reporters at his hotel yesterday and issued the following written statement:</p>
<p>"This session of the UNESCO was quite successful. Although the Chinese delegation was small in number, its members cooperated and worked hard, and were able to make some real contributions. However, previous preparation work has always been insufficient. I deeply hope that the Chinese Committee can jointly take responsibility and assist the government in researching, implementing, and promoting projects and initiatives related to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. On our way back, we passed through the United States, where we were hosted by various Chinese and American groups and friends from Columbia and Harvard Universities. I deeply understood that the traditional friendship of the American people towards the Chinese people remains consistent. However, general perceptions are sometimes swayed by emotions, but are now becoming more realistic and forming a correct understanding, so as to adopt active policies. In Washington, we were hosted by friends from the Far East Division of the State Department's Cultural Division. They paid close attention to the Sino-American Cultural Agreement and hoped that it could truly promote cultural exchange. My planned inspection of the facilities and equipment lost by our country's cultural and educational institutions during the war has also been decided to be assisted in the restoration. Regarding the establishment of "Current Affairs" courses in American universities, Mr. Hang stated that the curriculum and educational system of American schools are undergoing different experiments. The "Current Affairs" course is similar to the "World Citizen" curriculum stipulated by UNESCO, and the Chinese authorities are paying close attention."</p>

<h3>Commercial and Financial Figures in This City Review the Impact of Tightening Monetary Policy Although There Is a Huge Influx in National Banks, Prices Have Not Fallen Proportionately Tightening Monetary Policy Should Not Freeze Production Funds</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Some commercial and financial figures in this city recently expressed their opinions on the impact of the authorities' tightening of monetary policy and the large influx of funds into national banks on general industry, commerce, and prices, as follows. They believe that general commercial firms have now lost their powerful role as regulators of industrial, commercial, and financial affairs. Moreover, the deposits of general commercial firms are mostly excessive and not retained. Therefore, commercial firms are no longer the target if the authorities want to control prices and tighten monetary policy. Furthermore, in the past, the authorities often overemphasized the effectiveness of national bank loans. In fact, most of the loans of national banks require a two- or three-month review period, and the loans often fail to fully meet the needs of industry and commerce. Therefore, the greatest effectiveness of national bank loans is only to reduce the interest burden of industry and commerce. It is estimated that the total left loans of commercial firms in the city recently are only more than 2 trillion yuan. However, the total amount of the huge influx of funds into national banks in the past ten days has exceeded 1.2 trillion yuan. In principle, prices should have fallen sharply proportionally, but this is not the case in reality. Furthermore, due to domestic exchange restrictions, a large amount of cash from other cities flows to Shanghai and is repeatedly recovered by national banks. Therefore, the result of tightening monetary policy is only to provide opportunities for certain special classes whose funds are not affected by the tightening of monetary policy by national banks. Legitimate industry, commerce, and commercial firms, on the other hand, are directly hit by the tightening of monetary policy. They very much hope that the authorities, when tightening monetary policy, will take into account other factors at the same time, and especially pay attention to not freezing production funds.</p>
<h3>Export of Cotton Textiles To Be Handled Exclusively by the Export Association</h3>
<p>Regarding the export of cotton textiles, in order to maintain reproduction operations, various replication manufacturers have exchanged cotton yarn with the China Trust Bureau for foreign exchange earned from exports, so as to increase replication raw materials. However, the procedures for the rotation of these finished products have always been certified and issued by the Export Promotion Office and have not passed through the Export Association. Now that the export business of textiles is exclusively handled by the Export Association, this case has been agreed upon by the Export Promotion Office and the association. Subsequently, the export of cotton textiles must also be approved by the association. The exchange of cotton yarn and cloth with the China Trust Bureau should be exchanged within the 20% quota of the total output of each yarn factory and shall not exceed the quota.</p>
<h3>Textile Federation Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The National Textile Federation will convene a standing board of directors and supervisors meeting at 4:00 PM on the 22nd to discuss: 1. Opinions on the control of cotton yarn and cloth; 2. The stamp tax issue for the cotton textile industry; 3. The issue of reparations from Japan.</p>
<h3>Coal and Firewood Charcoal Sales Are Brisk</h3>
<p>Due to the severe cold, the fuel market is seeing brisk activity in all aspects of procurement. Transactions within the market are unusually active. The price of various grades of smoky white coal has risen by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan compared to before. Jiao Zuo lump coal is 9.2 million to 9.3 million yuan per ton, small white coal is 7.5 million to 7.6 million yuan, and smoky coal lump has risen to 5 million yuan, an increase of 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The firewood and charcoal market is also seeing a sudden increase in demand due to the cold weather. The amount of goods arriving downstream is not large, and the market is profitable. Chestnut firewood has risen to 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per load, pine firewood and miscellaneous firewood are 100,000 to 110,000 yuan, and green charcoal has also risen by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to about 400,000 yuan per load. White and black charcoal are priced at 300,000 to 250,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ramie From Tianjin is in Good Demand</h3>
<p>The ramie market has seen very little arrival of goods from Hankou recently, and the appetite for procurement from Tianjin is very healthy. The current stock in the market is weak, so the prices being made are showing increases. The association's quoted price has also increased, with white Tibetan ramie rising by 200,000 yuan to 2.5 million yuan per load. Qing Tibetan has risen to 2.3 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan. Hang Su is also good at 150,000 yuan, for 1.4 million yuan. The door-to-door price is 2.8 million yuan for white Su, 2.5 million yuan for Qing Su, and 1.6 million yuan for Hang Su, an increase of about 10%.</p>
<h3>Soviet Fertilizer and Newspapers Meet Our Country's Needs</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Political Affairs Conference recently discussed the signing of the Sino-Soviet Commercial Treaty. A certain expert familiar with the actual commercial situation between China and the Soviet Union stated: "Based on the trade experience of the past few years, the goods exported from the Soviet Union to our country are mainly fertilizer, and our country is still an agricultural country today, and fertilizer meets our needs very well. In addition, there are newspapers and wood pulp, which are currently in demand. As for what our country can supply to the Soviet Union, tung oil has been the first in the past, followed by raw silk. However, the market for raw silk is getting better and better, and sales are booming. Therefore, unless the Soviet Union can offer a considerable high price, our country will probably not supply it. Pig bristles were also one of the goods transported to the Soviet Union in the past, but the Soviet side, after transporting them back to their country, resold them at low prices in the American and European markets in order to easily obtain US dollars. This point, from the Soviet Union's point of view, has its own certain national policy, but the export of pig bristles from our country is greatly affected. Now the sales of pig bristles in our country are very good, and there seems to be no reason to supply this commodity to the Soviet Union, thereby damaging our overseas market. Tea has also been a commodity transported to the Soviet Union, and if the other party needs it, it can still be supplied in the future. As for the size of the trade volume, because the Soviet Union's commerce is entirely controlled by the state, it is difficult to predict."</p>

<h3>Authorities Determined to Strictly Ban Securities Firms Not Run By Brokers</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] In this city, there are around two hundred securities firms or shops that are not run by certified brokers. Ordinarily, they solicit customers to buy and sell securities, mostly as intermediaries between brokers and customers. Their business has been quite prosperous. Recently, financial management authorities, due to the fact that many of the money exchange businesses that are being banned also engage in securities trading and often engage in over-the-counter transactions to evade transaction taxes, are going to ban securities firms that are not run by brokers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, the financial regulator stationed at the Securities Exchange, told reporters yesterday: Securities exchange brokers previously applied to the two ministries of finance and economics for permission to add branch offices and salespersons. In order to stabilize the financial situation, the two ministries have already approved a postponement of the discussion. Therefore, according to regulations, only approved securities exchange brokers can engage in the trading of listed securities. As for securities shops or firms not run by brokers, the Social Affairs Bureau has not yet approved their registration, so they do not have a legitimate status and should be banned. The supervision office of the two ministries has already investigated and prepared for the banning work, so as to cooperate with the Municipal Police Department to implement the ban.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Branch of the National Treasury To Be Established on January 4th</h3>

<h3>After Household Oil Is Distributed, China Vegetation Oil Plant Stops Allotment Sales</h3>

<h3>Production Increase Plan for the Paper Industry: Self-Sufficiency Possible in Three Years</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After the National Economic Commission approved the paper industry production increase plan, all parties have attached great importance to it. Everyone believes that if this plan is implemented step by step, not only can the paper industry maintain its current status and overcome current difficulties, but it can also achieve self-sufficiency within three years. Recently, a person in the paper industry said: The government has already started implementing this plan, and it is expected that within three years, production will increase from the original 14,000 tons to 70,000 tons. However, he believes that the government should find ways to supply wood pulp. Of the 70,000-ton increase, half should be used as raw materials for the manufacture of white newsprint, and this city accounts for one-half of this number. If the wood pulp problem cannot be solved, not only will the production increase be affected, but all factories in Shanghai and Qingdao will inevitably reduce production or even shut down. After the paper mills are allocated wood pulp, the selling price of their paper should be based on cost plus a reasonable profit to avoid profiteering. Paper-making equipment should take this opportunity to reorganize and strengthen production capacity. The increased production should be used entirely for allocation to meet general needs. The government should allocate fuel supplies reasonably. Strengthen management work and hope that familiar paper industry organizations will participate in supervision.</p>
<h3>Dredging Coal Sources and Increasing Coal Production</h3>
<p>When commodity prices are soaring without limit, most people believe that to stabilize prices, there must be a "fundamental solution." And the fundamental solution is to ensure the free flow of goods and increase production. Other measures can only provide temporary relief. However, at this stage, discussing increasing production can only be approached locally. To locally increase industrial production, the only way is to relax restrictions on industrial electricity use. Currently, the existing production capacity of Shanghai's industries seems to have the potential for growth. There are many cases of having the tools but being unable to produce. And the reason for this inability to produce is the lack of electricity. Since the victory, the country has been plagued by a coal shortage. The supply of electricity cannot be promoted without coal, so the crux of the problem lies in the supply of coal.</p>
<p>Reduced industrial production is closely related to commodity prices. Industrial production relies on the rate of industrial production to reduce the cost of finished products. Now, because of insufficient electricity, the speed of industrial production is gradually decreasing, so the cost of finished products cannot be reduced and will even increase. Whether the machines are running or not, the factory's expenses are the same. Moreover, because of insufficient production, consumption cannot be reduced, so the skyrocketing of prices is inevitable.</p>
<p>China's coal reserves rank third in the world, with a total of 217.6 billion metric tons. However, the output has been declining in recent years. Taking the two major coal-producing areas, Northeast and North China, as examples, the monthly output in the Northeast is about 300,000 tons. Due to the increasing war zone recently, the monthly output is only 70,000 tons. The output in North China is even lower than in the Northeast. The actual amount that can be produced is currently impossible to estimate accurately. The combined monthly output of other mines, including Taiwan, Huainan, Jiangxi, Tianhe, Pole, Yongxing, Xiangtan, Yizhang, Yuanhua, northern Guangdong, Yiluo, and eastern China mines, is at most 214,000 tons. Except for the coal used by the railways nearby, there is probably very little coal left for industrial use. Furthermore, due to traffic congestion, the produced coal is often piled up in the mining areas and cannot be transported out. The mines accumulate "coal" day by day, which cannot be shipped out, and the production funds cannot be turned around, eventually leading to a state of semi-paralysis.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing area requires 250,000 tons of coal per month, plus 100,000 tons for railway use, totaling 350,000 tons. In winter, the extra coal consumption and the increased amount required in the heating rate due to the severe weather will account for more than double.</p>
<p>Southern coal has always relied heavily on supplies from the north, so now we still hope that the northern mining areas can actively increase production. At the same time, relief should be provided to the coal mines in the areas south of the Yellow River as soon as possible. Even more importantly, in terms of transportation, coal transport should be the top priority, because smooth sources will enable the funds of various mines to be turned around quickly, which will have a complementary effect on increasing coal production.

<h3>About the TVA</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>The TVA was established on May 18, 1933, just a few months after President Roosevelt took office, when the country was in a recession. However, Roosevelt was willing to take on this dangerous and huge project amid a chorus of opposition.</p>
<p>Lilienthal was appointed to head the TVA in the spring of 1945, just as President Roosevelt was about to pass away. Therefore, the first difficult decision for President Truman after taking office was whether to continue to appoint Lilienthal as the head. Although many people opposed Lilienthal's reappointment, due to the unanimous public opinion of the people in the TVA area supporting Lilienthal, all plans ultimately remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Lilienthal sacrificed twenty times his salary in private enterprise to work for the TVA and was willing to work for public services.</p>
<p>The TVA has been established for fourteen years until this year. It has spent more than 750 million US dollars. There are a total of 26 great dams. The amount of earth, bricks, stones, and reinforced concrete used is enough to fill a large hole ten feet in diameter that runs through the earth from the United States to China.</p>
<p>The TVA is the first institution in the United States designed entirely by the federal government. It not only has the power to cross state boundaries, but it can also be free from the constraints of existing federal government agencies. It has autonomy and is only subject to congressional control. It can make its own decisions on administrative management. The decentralization of power is clear, so although the organization is large, problems that occur in various units in various places can be resolved locally immediately. There is no malpractice of official document travel, and there are no problems that are involved in real politics due to administration. All staff appointments and promotions are absolutely based on their merits, experience, and abilities.</p>
<p>In the first ten years after its establishment, the TVA had already raised the living standards of 3,225,000 people in the Tennessee Valley by 75%, and the average living standards of the people nationwide by 56%.</p>
<p>Its most significant achievement is rural electrification. There are now 125,000 farms in the TVA area that use electricity. Other achievements include the completion of 650 miles of navigable canals, a "soil hospital" network, 29,000 demonstration farms, newly developed fisheries, tannin factories, a lumber factory's wood utilization laboratory, 150 million newly planted trees, and successful anti-malarial campaigns.</p>
<p>The TVA organization is huge and complex, and everything applies the latest scientific theories and technologies, so it has had a great educational significance on society. It is like a large factory and even more like a university. All the staff are like faculty members. Their knowledge level is very high, comparable to that of the US Steel Corporation, the University of Chicago, and Harvard University. Because they are tasked with creating miracles, none of them is not doing their best for the public.</p>
<p>The area supplied by the TVA includes one-quarter of Kentucky, all of Tennessee, one-quarter of Alabama, one-third of Mississippi, one-tenth of Georgia, and a small part of North Carolina and Virginia.</p>
<p>The TVA's control of floods is a most powerful giant. The 1937 floods in the United States left millions homeless, and the 1943 floods destroyed millions of acres of farmland in four states, destroying 160,000 families. However, now these disasters have all been restrained and subdued by the power of the TVA! The TVA has also completed one of the most laudable tasks for mankind, that is, it has completely and absolutely broken away from the influence of political forces and laid the foundation for a detached and great engineering creation for mankind!</p>
<p>Let us sing loudly, what is the TVA like that joins the party!</p>
<h3>Supersonic Rocket Airplane</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zuoqing</p>
<p>No airplane has ever been able to exceed the speed of sound, but according to recent experiments, the XS-1 aircraft, which uses rocket energy, can fly at 1,500 to 2,500 miles per hour, almost three times faster than the speed of sound.</p>
<p>This high-speed aircraft, which is one or two times faster than the speed of sound, naturally has an extraordinary structure. It has an unprecedentedly stronger fuselage that can withstand gravity eighteen times that of the earth's center of gravity. The XS-1 aircraft is the crystallization of cooperation between the US Air Force, Bell Aircraft Corporation, and the American Institute of Aeronautics.</p>
<p>Although it is a highly streamlined type, this high-pressure rocket aircraft still retains a considerable appearance of an aircraft. It has a pair of extremely thin wings made of aluminum alloy; in order to avoid unreliable welding, this wing is cut from a whole piece of aluminum alloy.</p>
<p>There are four engines inside the aircraft, using alcohol and liquid oxygen as fuel. Each engine can generate 1,500 pounds of thrust, so there is a total of 6,000 pounds of propulsion. One pound of thrust is equivalent to one horsepower at a speed of 375 miles per hour; for example, one pound of thrust is also equivalent to two horsepower at a speed of 750 miles per hour. The engine's power output therefore increases with its speed. The method of controlling power output is to use the method of resting some of the four engines and starting others, so when the pilot starts one engine, there will be 1,500 pounds of thrust, and when two are started, there will be 3,000 pounds; and so on, you can get 1500 4500; 6000; four different thrusts, so you can do whatever you want, adapt to the situation, and if a specially designed turbo-pump is completed, even slower speeds can be manipulated.</p>
<p>The aircraft is 31 feet long, 10 feet 10 inches high from the ground to the top of the tail, and has a smaller wingspan of only 28 feet. When empty, it weighs 4,892 pounds; of which, the instruments used for high-speed flight research weigh 526 pounds, but the rocket fuel weighs 8,177 pounds, which is more than one and a half times heavier than the empty aircraft. In order to save the weight of the fuel, a B-29 aircraft must first tow the XS-1 aircraft to a high altitude, and then it will start on its own to conduct experiments. Aircraft experimental reports show that although the aircraft can have a high speed of three times the speed of sound, it works best at an altitude of 80,000 feet.</p>

<h3>Red Leaves</h3>
<p>— Wei Yuan</p>
<p>After you return from touring the lakes and mountains in autumn, I think you will definitely bring a few red leaves home. Then, when you clip them in a book or decorate them on your desk, you may recite the poem "I picked up an autumn from the wild."</p>
<p>Perhaps you have a courtyard at home with sycamore or maple trees. Then, in the quiet of early morning or evening, you may also have experienced the poetic meaning of "falling leaves silently" like the ancient poets' "falling flowers silently" under the sycamore or maple trees.</p>
<p>The reason I say this is because I want to tell you that red leaves—falling leaves—are a natural phenomenon, just like a green fruit ripens and it must fall off at some point, not necessarily because the wind blows it or someone picks it. Of course, when the wind blows, it is easier to fall off.</p>
<p>I don't know if you have noticed the base of the petiole of the red leaves you picked up. If you have paid attention, I think you will definitely be surprised, because the bases are all very smooth planes. It doesn't look like a fracture surface.</p>
<p>This surface is the origin of the red leaves.</p>
<p>The occurrence of this surface is as follows: On the petiole of an ordinary leaf, there are two mechanical tissues (Collenchyma) on the upper part of a concave defect, because the two mechanical tissues, like two iron sheets, are attached, the leaves are like having their seat belts and are very difficult to be blown off the branches by the wind. However, when the autumn wind blows on the earth, the climate has begun to cool down and become dry. There is too little moisture in the air, which will cause the moisture in the leaves to run outward. The moisture often runs outward, so not only can the photosynthesis of the leaves (the process of water and carbon dioxide synthesizing carbohydrates in chlorophyll in the sun) not proceed, but it will also cause the phenomenon of backflow of water in the body—the water in the plant body runs out, which is the ultimate threat to plant life—just like humans can have life-threatening dangers from vomiting and diarrhea and excessive water loss.</p>
<p>Do plants just sit and wait to die like this? No, they have very subtle effects—leaf fall prevents this threat. This effect occurs at the base of the petiole:</p>
<p>The base of the petiole is originally composed of tough permanent tissue. When the autumn wind rises, that part slowly becomes an active meristem (Secondary Meristem). This meristem gradually forms a layer of disorganized (Abscission layer) parenchyma tissue at the base of the petiole. Due to the formation of this abscission layer, the mechanical tissues and large and small leaf veins are completely separated. Leaf veins can send moisture, and once they are broken, the water route is also cut off, so the water in the plant body does not need to be lost too much and cause death. Since the water has run from the leaves into the dry air, and there is no source of regaining it, the leaves gradually begin to lose their green years. Waiting for the day when the force of the leaves growing on the branches is extremely small, the leaves leave the branches. Of course, this phenomenon of leaf fall, which disregards the existence or non-existence of the small self for the safety of the mother body, has its profound meaning.</p>
<p>Of course, some people will still ask: What about the leaf blade turning red?</p>
<p>It's like this: Plant cells contain plastids. Plastids can be divided into leucoplasts (Leacoplas) and chloroplasts (Chloroplasts). The (leucoplasts can become green and other pigments, which can be seen from the white core of the cauliflower). Chloroplasts can be divided into chlorophyll, xanthophyll, and carotene. These several kinds of pigments often vary with different environments (for example, the leaves of maple trees can have several colors). The closer to green the pigment is, the more beneficial it is to photosynthesis, and the closer to red it is, the more opposite the effect is. Therefore, when the leaves of a tree feel that they should not be doing photosynthesis during a period of water shortage, the reddish pigments inside it gradually increase. The reason why maple leaves become red leaves, while sycamore only are yellow withered cases, is all due to this reason.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope you cherish your red leaves, they are full of poetry and romance!</p>
<p>Scientific Discussion</p>
<h3>Sinicization of Number Grouping</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shimin</p>
<p>When we write down a long string of numbers, for example, 6,390,000,000, in order to make it easier to recognize its units, we put a (,) every three digits from the last digit. This is what I mean by the number grouping mark. Perhaps many people have not deeply considered this issue, and have always used a mechanical memorization, recognizing that the digit before the first mark represents the "thousands" place, the second mark is "millions" (Million), the third mark is "billions" (Billion), and so on. In fact, this kind of memorization is indeed a burden and very inconvenient for a Chinese learner. At least when I personally and many friends and colleagues I have contacted want to recognize a long string of numbers, these marks do not provide us with any convenience, so I propose this suggestion for improvement, hoping to be more suitable for our country's habits and system, that is, to emphasize Sinicization.</p>
<p>Before talking about the improvement method, we may as well first investigate why we adopted this unconventional grouping method in the past, which is helpful for us to further seek the motivation for the improvement method. Undoubtedly, we copied the Western set of number grouping methods without any changes, almost swallowing them whole. In fact, this grouping method does have convenient places in other countries. Taking England as an example, the units of advancement are ten, hundred, thousand, million, trillion, etc. There are no separate marks for "ten thousand" and "ten thousand ten thousand". Therefore, 40000 is called "forty thousand". 800,000,000 is called "eight hundred million", and therefore the first grouping mark is before the third digit, and the second grouping mark is before the sixth digit. In English reading, this is indeed relatively convenient.</p>
<p>But this method is naturally only applicable to a certain system. When it comes to China, a country with a "ten thousand" unit, we would never call four ten thousand "forty thousand", would we? For a high school or college student with a relatively good level of English, perhaps after a moment of hesitation, they can smoothly read a long string of numbers, but for children in junior high school or even elementary school, and to more broadly consider the people who have not studied English but must use numbers, must we insist on this foreign grouping method? Shouldn't we "possibly" establish a rule suitable for our national system?</p>
<p>The method is that simple: we use the relationship of the highest unit "ten thousand" that is reached in ordinary situations, and change from spacing three digits to spacing four digits. The first grouping mark is placed before the fourth digit, and the unit of the digit before it is "ten thousand". The second grouping mark is placed before the eighth digit according to the base-four system, and the digit before the second grouping mark is "ten thousand ten thousand". The third grouping mark is placed before the twelfth digit, the unit is "ten thousand ten thousand ten thousand"... and so on.</p>
<p>A group of thousands (that is, four digits) sandwiched between every two grouping marks, in addition to adding units such as "ten thousand" or "ten thousand ten thousand" according to the situation where the grouping mark is located, the reading method is naturally the same as in ordinary situations, without having to consider it. It is clear at a glance. The following example is extremely simple and can express our meaning more clearly.</p>
<p>Before this kind of question is raised, perhaps it is felt that there is no value in paying attention to it. After it is raised, it also appears extremely ordinary and superficial, but I hope that everyone will adopt it uniformly to establish our country's own system. Its convenience and importance are threefold: first, it can avoid irregular memorization. Second, the improvement is helpful for the popularization of science. Third, and most importantly, we cannot always have the idea of following others. We should strive to be self-reliant, establish our own scientific system, and make contributions to world academia.</p>

<h3>Flying Fish</h3>
<p>— Qu Youding</p>
<p>In the seas of warmer climates, flying fish often appear, which is a great miracle of nature and has long been noticed by biologists. Although this phenomenon is common, it is not easy to obtain accurate observations. What is usually seen with the naked eye is nothing more than schools of fish suddenly leaping out of the water, gliding for two or three seconds, and then safely returning to the water. After scholars of physics used new observation methods such as photography, they recently learned that when flying, they do not flap their "wings" like birds, but are only gliding.</p>
<p>Fish Body Structure There are four types of fish that can fly, but the easiest to see and the best at flying are the Cypsemrus tribe of the Exocoetodae family. Their pectoral and pelvic fins are more suitable for flying. These fish live close to the sea surface and swim quickly; their bodies are streamlined and they have huge eyes, similar to mackerel. Their streamlined bodies are not only suitable for flying, but also for fast swimming. The surface of the abdomen is smooth, so as to rise and fall at any time. The shape of the tail is the same as that of ordinary fish, also in a V shape; however, the lower part of the V shape is longer, almost one and a half times that of the upper half, because this kind of tail shape is of great help to flight. More important are the paired fins, which become wings, which are the most obvious adaptation to flight; the pectoral fins are about two-thirds of the total length of the body, and the area when unfolded is almost twice the area of the abdomen. When swimming, the pectoral fins are close to the body, and when flying, they extend almost horizontally across the entire body. The back of the fin is composed of a thin film, with ten to twelve ray-like ribs supporting it. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, mostly in a quadrangular shape, and their other structures are similar to the pectoral fins.</p>
<p>Flight Circumstances When starting to fly, the fish break through the water surface at high speed of swimming. This high speed is estimated to be about fifteen to twenty miles per hour. And from the photos taken, it is known that when the fish emerge from the water, their bodies are almost parallel to the water surface and not vertical. In a moment, they fly into the air, then the pectoral fins immediately unfold, and the pelvic fins are retracted. In this way, because the support force obtained by the tail is less than that of the head, the fish body forms an angle of about fifteen degrees with the water surface, and the lower half of the tail blade gradually remains in the water; moving forward along the water surface in this position is called "takeoff". During takeoff, the tail swings violently in the water at a speed of about fifty times per second; this speed increases further until the air speed is reached and then stops. As for how high the airspeed is, there are many different estimates—from about thirty-five miles to fifty-five miles per hour; however, according to photos taken by ordinary motion picture cameras, the speed should be twenty-five to thirty miles per hour. However, this may only be the speed close to the end of gliding, because the speed is too high when just emerging from the water to be photographed, so forty miles per hour should be the best estimate of its initial gliding speed.</p>
<p>During takeoff, the fish's body inevitably trembles due to the violent swinging of the tail, especially its wings (pectoral fins) (but it does not flap its wings). After the airspeed is reached, the pelvic fins are also unfolded, and the fish body is further parallel to the water surface, with a slope of only about six degrees; at the same time, the tail exits the water. From this point on, it glides at equal height with a distance of about one foot from the water, and the speed gradually decreases. However, in order to maintain the same height while the speed decreases, the angle between the two wings and the horizontal plane must continue to increase. When the airspeed is lost, either the fish body immediately falls into the water, or the pelvic fins are contracted again and again, and the lower part of the tail falls into the water and swings violently, so it regains the high speed of "takeoff" and glides a second time. This kind of re-takeoff situation is often seen: and there are those who glide repeatedly up to ten times.</p>
<p>Usually, their gliding can last for three or four seconds, but sometimes it is shorter; according to several observations by Hobbs, the estimated average flight time is 2.6 seconds (including "takeoff" time). However, some people have observed records of ten to thirteen seconds, which should be very rare. As for the distance of flight, it obviously varies with wind force and wind direction; in calm air, the average gliding distance is about forty to fifty feet, but there is also an estimate of one hundred yards. For exceptional glides of more than ten seconds, the distance should be greater. The speed at the end of its flight is about twenty-five miles per hour.</p>

<h3>Cadmium Rod</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>——Atomic Energy Controller</p>
<p>The English name for the cadmium rod is Cadmiumrod. Its name doesn't seem to appear frequently in newspapers and magazines, but it is the nemesis of the invincible atomic bomb, even more important than instruments like the cyclotron.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a cadmium rod is a long rod made of a cadmium substance. It has a special property—the ability to absorb neutrons. Because of this characteristic, it is used in experiments testing atomic energy.</p>
<p>American atomic energy experts initially experimented with atomic fission at the University of Chicago's testing ground. They bombarded Uranium atoms with neutrons, causing them to split and produce two or three neutrons and a large amount of energy. The resulting neutrons then created a chain reaction with other Uranium atoms, generating a vast amount of atomic energy.</p>
<p>However, the uranium atoms that can be broken down by neutrons are uranium-235, while ordinary uranium ore is mostly uranium-238. The content of uranium-235 is very low.</p>
<p>Therefore, scientists tried to separate these two isotopes, but because they have the same chemical properties, they are not easy to separate. To solve this difficulty, a new hypothesis was established: if uranium-238 could be converted into other elements, separation would be easier.</p>
<p>So, in a pile of graphite (note) and uranium ore spaced apart, scientists used neutrons passed through graphite to bombard uranium-238. The result was similar to the fission of uranium-235: two new elements were produced—neptunium and plutonium—along with a large amount of energy and neutrons.</p>
<p>These neutrons are the key to revealing the tiny and mysterious atomic universe. They can cause the nuclei of uranium-235 and plutonium to split. The explosion of the atomic bomb is due to this basic concept. Without the invention of the cadmium rod, if the neutrons were out of control and their numbers soared to a considerable proportion, the University of Chicago's experimental site would have been destroyed long ago. Then, no one could say when the atomic bomb would be invented, perhaps centuries later.</p>
<p>Regarding the defense against the radiation energy of atomic bombs, American scientists may be conducting further research on cadmium rods!</p>
<p>Note: The application of graphite is to reduce the speed of neutrons because low-speed neutrons easily cause fission.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Zhang Bo Lao</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Zhang Pu Lao (Ji) was the first person to spread revolutionary ideas in academic circles. It was during the late Qing Guangxu period when Liang Rengong's Xinmin Congbao and the Minbao, hosted by Zhang, engaged in a war of words. These two newspapers were banned items in the mainland at the time. They were either sent directly to the school by friends studying in Japan, or secretly purchased and read by others. Although Hu Hanmin and Zhang Taiyan mostly wrote the essays that confronted Liang head-on, the publisher was the famous "Zhang Ji." As a result, the earliest and most widespread impression of Zhang among young people was formed.</p>
<p>In 1928, the National Revolutionary Army pacified Beiping, unifying China. Zhang served as the chairman of the first political affairs committee and the chairman of the board of Pingmin University. He had an old friendship with the president, Wang Bo Lao (Dabian) (Zhang studied in Japan, and Wang served as the supervisor of students studying in Japan, and later as the ambassador to Japan, greatly valuing Zhang). Therefore, he was very enthusiastic about school affairs and attended every school affairs meeting in person. The faculty and staff actually admired this revolutionary veteran, who they thought possessed the heroic spirit to repel thousands, but he was actually simple, peaceful, and amiable. When I mentioned the past event of reading Minbao in the school, he attributed the credit to Hanmin and Taiyan.</p>
<p>"Broad forehead and large ears, tiger head 　　," one can still see the true nature of Zhao's generous and tragic songs. His ancestral home is Cangzhou, a major station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in Tianjin, a "busy, important, and difficult" position. It is one of the three famous prefectures in Hebei (Zhuozhou, Tongzhou, Cangzhou), formerly known as "Changlu," bordering the Bohai Sea along with Yanshan, Qingyun, and Wuding in Shandong, with many heroic figures, strong customs, and robust physiques. At the Sixth Plenary Session of the Capital in 1935, Wang's bodyguard encountered an obstruction, and Zhang Ji hugged the assassin around the waist, showing his courageous and enthusiastic spirit. In critical moments, his nature was naturally revealed, worthy of the strength of the North. Later, Wang became a traitor, and Pu Lao deeply regretted blocking the assassin in the first place, leaving him alive to do evil.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Restoration, Zhang and Lu Zhonglin served as envoys of appeasement, touring Yan and Ji, comforting the disaster-stricken people, and giving considerable comfort to those in the occupied areas. Yesterday, I heard that this old man suddenly died of angina pectoris on the night of the sixteenth, at the age of sixty-six (Wu Peifu also died at the age of sixty-six in 1939), which was quite unexpected, as he was healthy, strong, and simple, with the appearance of someone over eighty. However, the general authors of Minbao, Hu and Zhang, are long gone, and with this, the flow of blood has stopped.</p>

<p>The rapid scenery is fading, and it is already the Winter Solstice in the blink of an eye. This year's Winter Solstice Festival happens to be the day before Christmas Eve. The Chinese and Western festivals follow one another, making people feel even more that "the year is coming to an end." Another difficult year has passed!</p>
<p>"The Winter Solstice is as important as the New Year." The night before the Winter Solstice is the happiest time for family reunions; however, with the freezing weather and the cessation of warfare, even the most optimistic people can't help but shrink back, right?</p>
<p>I thought of the coal shortage in England, and I thought of the British spirit of "chin up" in times of adversity. This is truly a spirit worthy of emulation. In today's world, the so-called escape from reality by scholars and officials hiding in the mountains and forests is absolutely impossible. Rather than indulging in the imaginary Shangri-La, it is better to face reality bravely; do less grandstanding and more down-to-earth work. Knowing that there are many difficulties ahead, knowing that there are many stumbling blocks on the road; however, if you don't encounter difficulties, you won't have the joy of overcoming them.</p>

<h3>Talking About Turkey</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xingchu</p>
<p>Christmas is coming again, and beautiful and pleasing turkeys are on the market in due season. According to Western customs, turkey must be included in the dishes of this Christmas Day to celebrate. Some people regard it as one of the gifts to give to relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Turkey is the common name for the toothed bird. The term toothed bird is not as well known as turkey. It also has names such as guinea fowl, white heron, and filial crow. It originated in North America and has been raised since ancient times. It is said that turkey was introduced to Europe in 1499 AD.</p>
<p>Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty said in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "Firebirds are produced in the mountains of Ba Gorge, Min and Guang. People mostly play with them. They are as large as domestic chickens and as small as birds. Their heads and cheeks are like pheasants, and their feathers are mostly black, mixed with yellow and white spots like pearls. They have sacs under their necks, which contain fleshy streamers. They are usually invisible. Every spring and summer, when the weather is clear, they face the sun and swing them. Two green horns first emerge from the top, about two inches long, and then slowly unfold the streamers under their foreheads, which are nearly a foot long, alternating between red and green, with brilliant colors. After a while, they disappear." Liu Yuxi of the Tang Dynasty wrote in a poem: "Yue Mountains have birds soaring in the vastness, the light of the streamers in the middle of the sky is bright. The Yue people saw them occasionally and were amazed by them, so they named them toothed birds, which are known in Jiangnan. Siming Tianmu is a land of gods and immortals, and the essence of Zhu Bird is endowed with strange qi. Red jade is carved into brilliant feathers, and red silk is cut into exquisite wings. The lake smoke begins to clear and the mountain sun is high, facing the wind and spouting streamers to coil flower ribbons, reflecting the waves and dyeing the turquoise grass, suspecting that Queen Mother's peach blossoms are blooming by the leaves…" From this poem, we can see that China already had turkeys in the Tang Dynasty. According to the Dutch, the bird is called Tangguo Bird, so it was produced in our country. The Japanese call it the seven-faced crow because its head and forehead are bare, its skin is warty, and there is fleshy meat at the base of its upper beak, hanging under its beak, which can change color from time to time.</p>
<p>Currently, the turkey breeding ground in our country is Dinghai, Zhejiang. There is also an international historical fact behind its production of turkeys. During the Opium War in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, the British occupied Dinghai and brought many turkeys. After the British army left, they left the turkey species behind. The local villagers thought that the turkey was beautiful in shape, the meat was fresh and fat, and it was valuable, so they raised them one after another, spreading to this day. The output has increased year by year, and the turkey has become a specialty of Dinghai.</p>
<p>The meat of the turkey is tougher than that of the domestic chicken and extremely dry, which is not to the taste of the Chinese. However, Europeans and Americans say that its taste is endless, far better than the fat and fresh domestic chicken, no wonder they regard it as a precious delicacy once a year.</p>
<p>The average American turkey weighs more than twenty pounds, while the heaviest in our country weighs only more than ten pounds, and the average is only four or five pounds. The difference in achievement is entirely due to the lack of attention to breeding. If we improve it and use scientific methods to raise it, we can compete with imported products and supplement the livelihoods of farmers.</p>
<h3>Linked Phrases</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The Zhang Qiaoyang Temple in Zhongzi Mountain, Taizhou, has a linked phrase: "With full of emotion, he vowed to fight, guarding Suiyang, the most important area, in the isolated city, everyone was happy to die; calmly fulfilling his integrity, shaking the heroic spirit of Hebei, a thousand years later, his appearance is still lifelike." (See Lenglu Miscellany) Reading it, one can imagine the situation of that day.</p>
<p>When I was young, I studied in Wenzhou and occasionally visited Jiangxin Temple. I saw a linked phrase on the temple gate: "Clouds rise and fall every morning, rising and falling every morning, rising and falling scattering; tides rise and fall forever, rising and falling forever, rising and falling diminishing." It is said that it was written by Wang Meixi, the Zhuangyuan of the Song Dynasty, when he was studying in the temple. I don't know if it's true. The way to read it is quite difficult to understand. I think the first "rising" character is in the upper level tone, the second "rising" character is in the lower level tone, the third and fourth are both in the upper level tone, the fifth is in the lower level tone, the sixth is in the upper level tone, the seventh is in the lower level tone, and the eighth is in the upper level tone. The lower phrase is in the rising tone, the third and fourth are both in the level tone, the fifth is rising, the sixth is level, the seventh is rising, and the eighth is level. I have punctuated it like this, I don't know if there are other ways to read it? I hope readers will teach me. Recently, I saw Liang Zhangju's Continued Talks on Wandering, mentioning this linked phrase, but he did not punctuate it, only saying that he had witnessed this linked phrase forty-three years ago and left it alone because it was difficult to understand. It can be seen that this linked phrase is not only understood in this way. I heard from my teacher Zhou Zhiqiao that there is another linked phrase in the temple, also written by Meixi: "The twin towers are towering, like drumsticks hitting the white sun; the city is surrounded, growing teeth to bite the blue sky." In Jiangxin Temple, one can see the surrounding city of Wenzhou, and at each end of the isolated island (the location of Jiangxin Temple, the name of the isolated island is not very famous, and the villagers generally refer to it as Jiangxin Temple) there is a tower. Being there, one knows that this linked phrase is extremely appropriate and wonderful. I heard the linked phrase first, and then visited the temple, but I could not find it anywhere. I asked the people who were traveling with me at the time, and they all said they had not seen it. However, this linked phrase must be in Jiangxin Temple. If it is moved to another place, it will not be appropriate. And Liang Zhangju's Continued Talks on Wandering records the most detailed linked phrases of Wenzhou's scenic spots, but it does not mention this linked phrase. I don't know why, so I will record it for a later visit.</p>
<h3>Tonic</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Commercial advertisements are the most seasonal. Looking at the advertisements in the newspapers these days, I know that it is the season for "taking tonics." There are many kinds of tonics, such as Jilin ginseng, official swallow's nest, old Hong Kong pearl powder, and seasonal tonics. In addition, cod liver oil and various vitamins also belong to this category.</p>
<p>The human body has the function of metabolism, which is common sense that everyone knows. If a machine breaks down, it needs to be repaired with another part. Although it is not convenient to replace parts when the human body breaks down, it also needs to be repaired, which is called "taking tonics." Moreover, the function of "taking tonics" is said to be not only after the fact, but also to have a preventive effect. The so-called prolonging life and benefiting the marrow, which is often seen in tonic advertisements, is this meaning.</p>
<p>However, no matter how great the effect of tonics is, they are ultimately just medicine; according to medical common sense, it is a last resort for a person to take medicine. It is best to "be fortunate enough to avoid medicine." If it is necessary to take medicine, it is also reasonable to "prescribe the right medicine for the disease."</p>
<p>But many people nowadays have different views on "medicine"; things like paste tonics, ginseng regeneration pills, and cod liver oil are regarded as common tonics. Even various vitamin pills that should be used after a doctor examines the body, as well as various tonic injections, and even the milk and other foods that Europeans and Americans eat every day, are regarded by some people as tonics or supplements. Regarding milk and eggs as "supplements" certainly shows the food shortage of our people's livelihood, but on the other hand, seeing the abundance of national quintessence tonics cannot help but make people feel that our people are mostly sick.</p>
<p>Because people who can afford tonics now are probably those who have good nutrition and lifestyle in normal times and do not need urgent "medical tonics." The reason why they are willing to spend a lot of money to buy bitter water to drink is nothing more than the idea of "prolonging life and benefiting the marrow." In other words, it is groaning without illness. And groaning without illness is precisely a serious social disease among our nation.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Europeans and Americans advocated the saying "life begins at forty." Now they are further discussing "life begins at seventy or eighty." The meaning is that a person's real life should begin around the age of forty or fifty, and even at seventy or eighty, he is still strong and has a lot to offer.</p>
<p>But in our country, it is different. The so-called thirty "establishment," forty "no confusion," and then it is "knowing fate," and it should be "preparing the coffin" to wait for "dying in peace." Since our concept of life is so "prematurely aging," how can there not be many people in society who groan without illness, and how can our nation avoid the ridicule of being "sick men"?</p>
<p>This is not to say that tonics should not be eaten; people with insufficient nutrition should eat more cod liver oil or some kind of gelatin. It is best that everyone can regard milk and eggs as common meals. But being too superstitious about the so-called "tonics" and making the vitality of life weak and forming a social atmosphere lacking in progress is "more harm than good."</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 5 An Unexpected Calamity (3)</p>
<p>Zhu thought again and again that Qiwan was struggling for the sake of art, and was not different from sacrificing her beauty. How painful it was for a beautiful woman like a flower to be paired with an ugly ghost with incorrect facial features! Thinking about it, he felt very unfair and couldn't help but stand up. Seeing this, Little Wang's mother was shocked and asked, "Mr. Xu, are you leaving?" When Zhu Zhai was reminded by her, he pretended to have difficulty walking again, limping and saying, "Yes, I'm leaving." Little Wang's mother said, "Slow down, slow down! I'll get the car." After going out for a while, she came back and said, "The car is here." Zhu Zhai took out a few banknotes from his pocket and stuffed them into Little Wang's mother's hand, saying, "Thank you. Don't tell her when the boss comes back." Little Wang's mother held the banknotes and refused to accept them. Zhu Zhai had already limped out of the gate, got into the car and left. The rickshaw puller was an old man, holding the handlebars with both hands, like an old ox, walking slowly step by step. Zhu Zhai was in the car, thinking about Qiwan's situation, feeling very sad. He thought that drama was originally a specialized art. Although the status of actors is higher than before, the general people who appreciate art are not as kind as before. Twenty years ago, any actor with artistic talent who could be cultivated would be cultivated by a music connoisseur, promoting his art. Like the current Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, who can form their own schools, they were all recognized and cultivated by several famous scholars and wealthy people at that time to reach their current status. They upheld the friendship of righteousness, all helping people to become famous, without other purposes. Now the human heart is not as it used to be, and everything is selfish and self-interested. The so-called corner master spends a sum of money and must earn back all the principal and interest to satisfy his desires. A person with artistic talent like Qiwan, if recognized by a famous master twenty years ago, could have increased her value tenfold. Why should she be so pitiful now, bowing and submitting to others for some extra props? Her ambition is commendable, and her situation is also sad! What I regret is that I don't have this ability. Although there is a small amount of property at home, it is under the control of my old father and cannot be moved. Otherwise, I will do my best to supply Qiwan and achieve her future. If she follows the current situation and drifts with the tide, her will will easily weaken and she will easily degenerate. I met her by chance, and she treated me like an old friend at first sight, telling me all her heartfelt words, which shows that she has a loyal heart. She kept saying that I was honest and recognized me as her confidant. I can't help her, and I really feel ashamed. That night, the bright moon was in the sky, and the rickshaw was walking very slowly. Because Zhu Zhai's mind was lingering with Qiwan, he didn't notice that the rickshaw puller was an old man, letting him walk step by step, and he didn't think he was walking slowly. Looking at the moon, he recalled the situation of whispering and cherishing with Qiwan in the park, feeling very emotional. What I regret is that I met her too late. If I had met her half a year ago, I would not have married yet, and there might have been a possibility of a good flower and a full moon. It can be seen that the heavens are too teasing, and nothing is satisfactory. Zhu Zhai was looking up at the moonlight, fantasizing, when he suddenly heard a scream, and couldn't help but be stunned.</p>
<h3>Empty Fame</h3>
<p>— Jiyong</p>
<p>Li Bai was the first to oppose fame, although he was not very indifferent to profit. "I only wish to have a glass of wine before I die, why bother with fame for a thousand years"? The words are very optimistic, but they are not very consistent with his person. Why did he seek He Zhizhang and Gao Lishi, and why did he join Yong Wang Lin, so he became a complaining person who could not achieve anything. Liu Yong wrote a sentence "I can't bear to exchange my floating name for a shallow drink and low singing," losing the jinshi title on the list of released candidates. It can also be called the extreme of literary inquisition. However, what they said all belong to the "hermit type" of Taoist thought, not the original meaning of this topic.</p>
<p>The so-called empty fame here is something "unearned." There are no lack of people in the world who get undeserved praise, and a knock on their truth often brings unexpected disappointment, especially in politics, where books often differ greatly from reality. Zhang Duanyi's Noble Ear Collection Volume 1 contains a passage:</p>
<p>"Scholars and officials are most afraid of having empty fame. If empty fame prevails, it is not a blessing for the court. Zhen Xishan bore the great name of the world. How could Xishan really want to love fame in the world? The world naturally respects him when they hear his name. When Shi Tongshu died, people all over the world said: If Zhiyuan enters the court, peace in the world can be expected. When he entered the court, his previous reputation was slightly reduced... There is a saying in the capital: If you want all things to be cheap, you must have Zhen Zhiyuan. When he is called, he stirs it into a mass of noodles! In this way, fame is one thing, and career is another. The land in Jiangnan is shallow, and scholars and officials can only do one thing, not two."</p>
<p>This is a great blow to those who love "orthodox writing." Yijianmian, this word is still used by northerners today, or changed to guo, which means chaotic. Xishan was the leader of Song learning, and his achievements were only so-so. No wonder later people scolded Taoists for only being able to "talk about morality with their hands in their sleeves when nothing happens, and die to repay the emperor in times of crisis"?</p>
<p>However, it is not just this. I remember that Zhou Mi's Kueixin Miscellany contained many articles scolding Taoism. There is an appendix to the end of the Song and Yuan Xue'an, and Li Yueman also praised it in his diary. Unfortunately, it is not at hand, so I cannot copy it. I only remember that it was because they were too hypocritical. Before encountering difficulties, scholars and officials often have a set of hypocritical magic weapons, such as the so-called "cannon" is also. But when they come to power, they will also let profit "blind" the Tao. The holy scriptures and virtuous biographies will be forgotten by all. Why was Xie Jin not a Confucian scholar in the early Ming Dynasty? On the one hand, he made a big fuss about dying for Jianwen's country, and on the other hand, he asked in detail whether the piglets had been fed today. It is laughable and sighable, which is why I disrespect Confucian scholars.</p>
<p>However, there are many short-sighted people in the world. For a cannon that is loud and loud, they can't help but look at it with surprise and express admiration. But they completely forget the famous saying of Franklin that they read every day: "Great-talkers are little doers." Isn't that terrible? This opens another path for ambitious people. The cannon can be fired loudly and especially loudly, and then fame and wealth will come gurglingly.</p>
<p>Zhang Duanyi was from Zhengzhou and lived in Suzhou. The previous words could not help but be disrespectful to the southern compatriots. Only in the Song Dynasty, southerners were not allowed to be prime ministers and top scholars, which was a system established at the beginning of the country. Later, it was divided into two factions. Sima Guang, the conservative faction, was from the north, and Wang Anshi, the reformist faction, was from the south. Qian Binsi said that Cai Jing's party was mostly southerners (see Outline of National History), or Zhang was also talking about it with emotion? Now we naturally no longer have regional concepts, but in the Qing Dynasty, the Yan-Li school, which rose suddenly, focused on practice, and opposed empty reputation, was the authentic predecessor of Baoding Prefecture and Chuxi Chun's hometown. This can also be deeply considered.</p>
<p>I ask you: How many of the famous people you have always admired have not disappointed you?</p>
<h3>Age Calculation Method</h3>
<p>— Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>A London socialite once asked Bernard Shaw, "How old do you think I am this year?"</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw said, "Judging from your teeth, I should say you are only eighteen years old; judging from your permed hair, you are only nineteen years old; judging from your attitude, you are only fourteen years old."</p>
<p>That woman was very happy and said, "Thank you for your kind words, but how old do you think I am in the end?"</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw said, "Ah, isn't that easy to calculate? Add eighteen, nineteen, and fourteen together, and the answer is fifty-one years old."</p>
<h3>Flower and Grass Records (1)</h3>
<p>— Mengnong</p>
<p>The Injured Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>I sold two chrysanthemums, but there are only empty pots at home. This is really a bit embarrassing. How can they survive? Seeing these two chrysanthemums with roots but no soil wither away alive is really unbearable, so I had to rack my brains to find a way for them.</p>
<p>I thought of a pair of empty bottles in the corner of the easel. I brushed off the thin dust and filled them with clear water, maybe I could save the chrysanthemums' lives. With this thought, the two chrysanthemums finally had a place to settle down. One was planted in a magnetic pot, and the other was offered in a bile bottle, both becoming small decorations in my home in autumn and winter.</p>
<p>After a few days, looking at the two small decorations, the issue of survival or life suddenly broke out in secret. The chrysanthemum in the pot was originally placed on the windowsill, where it could enjoy the wind, drink dew, and naturally bask in the sun. Unexpectedly, one day, a strong wind suddenly blew. The window was attacked by the strong wind and knocked over the chrysanthemum. Some of the petals were injured and gradually died; however, the most amazing thing is that some of the petals that were not injured grew larger and stronger day by day. This shows that they are developing a glorious and more powerful line of life under the destructive state.</p>
<p>Looking back at the scene of the chrysanthemum in the bile bottle, a general atmosphere of vying for beauty is also emerging in front of me. Although the roots are broken, the leaves are sparse, the flowers are broken, and even the shadow of the soil is not seen, leaving only a little bit of clear water, but the chrysanthemum, broken here, does not just wither away. Like wild grass in rock crevices, it is gushing out the power of survival in twists and turns. "The chrysanthemum has just bloomed, and a branch is lightly broken off and brought back. It is a pity that its heart has not died, and it still opens in the bile bottle!"</p>
<p>If I were a poet, I would definitely write such lines as my lament for the fate of the potted chrysanthemum.</p>
<h3>Seeing the Big Picture from the Small</h3>
<p>— Ji'er</p>
<p>Eminent predecessors often have a preconceived notion when judging people, which is "seeing the big picture from the small." Although "a prodigy at a young age may not necessarily be great later in life," it seems that if one is not outstanding when young, they will certainly not be great later on. The accuracy of such foresight is quite debatable, but it is not without considerable reason. Therefore, the older generation liked to use this approach; I wonder if it is still common today.</p>
<p>My maternal uncle told me that when he went to the capital to take the imperial examinations, he was still young. At that time, Weng Changshu was the Prime Minister. All the young men from his hometown who came to the capital to take the examinations and paid him a courtesy visit were received, and he never refused requests for calligraphy works or couplets. Therefore, my uncle also paid him a visit. That day, there were not many people in the inner hall. Someone suggested playing cards, and Changshu asked him to join the game while he stood by and watched. After a while, the game ended, and Changshu said to my uncle, "Young people should avoid being harsh. I see that you are quite kind!" It seems that mahjong can also be used to observe a person's character, which is to see the "big" from the "small." Generally, a person's temperament is most easily revealed unconsciously. When playing cards, one inevitably becomes elated and loses control, thus revealing their true nature. This may have the same meaning as observing a person's character through their handwriting.</p>
<p>In addition, writers often like to "see the big picture from the small" in their writing. In ancient times, many people developed grand theories from everyday trivial matters, especially during the Qing Dynasty, such as Zheng Banqiao's family letters. However, some criticized this as "making too much of small things." Recently, articles in newspapers and magazines mostly belong to this "seeing the big picture from the small" category, first discussing trivial matters and then expressing grand theories, which is quite representative of the current trend. For if one does not "see the big picture from the small," then what else can one do?</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
