<h3>總動員令推行辦法政務會議提付討論　全國編餘軍官一律留用</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕總動員令公布後，其推行辦法等細則問題，連日正由政院召集有關部會首長集會商討。七日下午三時之會，由王雲五主持，蔣勻田·左舜生·甘乃光曁國防部代表秦德純，糧食部代表趙龍文均出席，會中主要議題為徵糧數額，經決定自本年十月起至明年九月止，徵糧徵幣總額為六千萬担，此項決定，將提交八日政務會議討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕據軍聞社訊：軍事當局為配合勦匪總動員，特規定全國現有編餘軍官無論將·校·尉級，除合格退（除）役及志願退役者外，一律留用。聞中訓團奉令後，將首先甄選校級優秀編餘軍言一八〇人，分發去部隊任用，其餘留用人員亦將於月底前全部辦理完竣。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕兵役局長徐思平七日談：總動員案公布後，辦理役政省職暫將加重，其需要各方恊助者亦將增加，此為意料中事。同時。目前已非平時可比，辦理役政，當不能如平時之從容不迫，在兵役處理上，不能不略求迅速，至兵源是否將增加，手續是否將變更，則須視指示而定。記者詢以國防工業工人等是否仍得緩召，徐謂：國防工人仍得緩召，此外，獨子緩召，小學敎帥緩召及高中以上學生得以緩征等規定並不變更，我國人力充足，辨兵役者希望不多擾民。記者又詢其京，滬等地募兵事，徐答：京·滬·平·津等地，學生多，工人多，公敎人員多，皆在緩召。緩征之列，增加征兵困難，然另一方面失業，失學者亦多，且不乏願為國家服務者，吳·沈兩市長曾以此請示主席，張院長根據兵役法三十二條之規定定「依志願而服兵役者其服役以命令定之」，故募兵於法並無不合，所成問題者，僅為數目是否足够，素質是否合乎要求，同時，募兵後並非謂即將恢復昔日之僱兵制，即使募兵已足實額，征兵工作仍將照常進行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕外傳總動員令公布後郵電將恢復檢查，記者頃訪交部某負責人及政院新聞局發言人，據稱：尙未接獲有關此事之命令。交部方面則稱：在若干地區如東北接近前綫區域，郵電檢查並未撤銷。又總動員後新聞檢查或不致恢復，設有必要，恐將僅限於軍事方面。</p>
<h3>主席召見于斌王德溥　垂詢東北各情形　于等貢獻意見均蒙嘉納</h3>

<h3>蔣總裁勗勉黨員　任勞任怨完成建國使命陳誠報告一年剿匪成果</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕陳總長七日上午九時在中央黨部紀念週作軍事報告，渠指出：勝利迄今兩年，因共黨叛亂，圖顛覆政府，出賣國家，竟至殘民以逞，致造成第二次嚴軍的國難，使我們的復員·整軍·和平建設等計劃無一不遭其破壞，終至反對國大及憲法，政府為拯救人民，乃不得不出於軍事進剿。關於剿匪軍事情形，陳氏首說明共匪態勢，山車葉劍英匪部約廿餘萬人。冀南劉伯誠匪部約十萬人，晋南陳赓匪部約四萬餘人，冀北聶榮臻匪部約九萬餘人，晋北賀龍匪部約三萬餘人，陝北彭德懷匪部約四萬餘人。關外由林彪統一指揮者，合約卅餘萬人，綜計關內外共有奸匪九十七萬人（內含有民兵）。陳氏繼述作戰經過，對東北華北各區戰事一一詳述，最後渠綜計一年來剿匪之成果，分為以下數點：（一）收復蘇北，使匪之繼食供應困難。（二）破壤平綏路沿綫日軍所建軍需工廠，使匪補充斷絕。（三）奪取匪之政治中心延安，喪其士氣。（四）確保抗戰勝利之成果，雖共匪勾結外力，企圖坐收漁人之利，迨國軍於去年四平街一役，將林彪主力整個擊破，最近復在四平街予匪以嚴重打擊，對於東北未接收之區域，希望繼續到全部。（五）一年收復城邑二一二縣，鹵獲各式槍砲七一〇九一三枝。六各種彈約一六四二三三三發，俘虜匪軍九四三八一人，投誠匪軍一四五二八五人。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕國民革命軍誓師紀念會及國民黨中央黨部總理紀念週，於七日上午九時在該部大禮堂合併舉行，蔣總裁領導行禮後，即由陳委員誠報告軍事，陳氏以今日同時為「七七」蘆溝橋事變十　年紀念日，回憶我全國上下八年艱苦抗戰所獲致之勝利，竟因共匪之禍國殃民，不能進而達成復員建國目的，實不勝憤慨，嗣即就最近之電事態勢，剿匪經過，以及一年來剿匪成果，逐項報告甚詳。最後陳氏作堅定表示稱：全國官兵一定能切實執行政府剿匪之命令，當有最大決心，為戡亂之先鋒，希望全國同胞以風雨同舟之合作精神，以期早日敉平匪亂。陳氏報告畢，蔣總裁並發表重要訓話，略謂：政府現己頒布全國總動員令，其意義即在加强剿匪力量，同時加强建設工作，建設工作最重要者，為依照旣定建國程序，實行民權主義，推進民主，另一方面則為內政之改革，本黨黨員在此國家萬分困難關頭，應發揮革命精神，任勞任怨，克服一切革命障礙，以完成剿匪，建國使命。</p>
<h3>孫副主席談時局　實施總動員後可縮短內亂時間兩黨要求比例選舉尙可商討中</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕孫副主席抵滬後，應記者之請，對時局問題有所答覆，茲分誌如下：（一）民靑兩黨要求比例選舉，為一有待解決之問題，目前尙在與蘇聯交涉。外蒙事實上為蘇聯之附屬國，與我國尙未建立外交關係，故一切交涉均須通過莫斯科。至於外傳蘇軍進佔塔城之說，本人在京時並無所聞。（三）中蘇關係，目前並不良好，此乃由於蘇方未能遵守中蘇條約，未將旅大交還之故。至於蘇聯最近撤退在華僑民，乃由於國內缺乏人力之故，對兩國邦交無大關係。（四）有詢以政府下動員令後，是否可縮短內亂時間，孫氏表示：政府集中全力戡亂，時期自可縮短，惟內亂何時結束，則只有上帝才知道。又「動員令下後，政黨不能再言反對內戰，否則即為反對政府，必予以斷然處置。此意諸君不妨轉告民盟」。孫氏對外傳渠將赴廣東之說，予以否認。</p>

<h3>搶修黃河大堤</h3>
<p>聯總駐華辦事處以黃河大汛卽屆，洪水堪虞，曾建議我政府及中共雙方，在全部黃河河床及河堤兩旁五英里內，停止任何軍事行動，俾復堤工作，得於七日底前完成，以防大汛襲來之禍患。我政府對於聯總建議完全接受，並派員與聯總及中共籌組混合委員會，完成斯事。詎共軍劉伯誠部，竟乘機强渡黄河董口，竄擾南岸，阻撓黃河復堤，致豫冀魯三省河堤，隨時有決口之危，形勢非常嚴重。為了這　大地區的人民生命財產，我們決不能錯過　防不防之期，坐待黃河大汛的來襲，審時度勢，願向各方面作搶修黃河大堤的呼籲。</p>
<p>黃河大堤民埝，九年失修，本年三月十五日花園口合龍完成後，黃河重行挽歸故道，惟沿河兩岸修守工程，較堵塞一口艱鉅，如大汛期前不豫加修復，不幸一堤決口，卽重演花園口黃水汛濫的災禍，人民生命財產就不堪設想了。黃河每歲有四汛期，七月一日大汛，為桃汛危險期的開始，今年因為兵荒馬亂，搶修堵守很有問題。水利部成立後，曾責成黃河水利工程總局督飭冀·魯·豫三修防處，徵工集料，日夜趕修。六月廿一日，政府，聯總，中共三方面代表，並亦荷澤舉行會議，成立恊定，規定於七月十五日為初步工程完成期限。同時聯總駐華辦事處，也提出國共兩岸停戰，加緊復堤的建議，並主張黃河三角洲居民火速遷移，免蹈戰前屢受水災之覆轍。該建議更表示聯總與國共切實合作之意，準備動員人力物資，隨時恊助調解，藉以推進工作，督導工程。挽救浩劫。聯總的服務精神，明遠的見解，應該值得敬佩！</p>
<p>不意中共缺乏理性，不重良知，對於廣大人民痛切相關的事，毫不重視。荷澤協定的墨瀋未乾，北岸共軍開始射擊，近日豫魯邊境劉伯誠部更不顧民瘼，潛派大軍渡河竄擾，這說明了荷澤的協定，中共是佯作商談，其眞正的企圖，是乘國軍的不備，復堤工作的緊張，出奇南竄，其陰狠，與明末李自成扒去黃河黑崗口，同出一轍，而在行動的表現上，劉伯誠較李自成更缺乏理性與良知。想來同情中共的人，目睹此情此景，對於中共必有一種新認識，認他們為不可靠。</p>
<p>黃河復堤的搶修與堵守，是一種建設的事業，和平的工程，需要在安寗的前提進行。現在黃河大堤民埝，從河南廣武的苦河起，到山東利津入海止的修守，計長一千二百里：南岸連濟南附近一段算入，政府控制的二分之一，北岸除陳橋以上外，幾乎全為共軍盤據。如果中共不願在安寗情况下，與政府及聯總合　。進行復堵工程，政府和聯總，是很少有回天之力，來進行和平的搶修堵守，於大汛來襲以後，祇有坐看平日的努力，功虧一簣，聯總負責人員，對於我國政情知之甚稔，所以緊急建議雙方沿河停戰，水利部瞭解這情形，所以多方爭取中共的合作，成立了荷澤協定。可惜劉伯誠這一「奇襲」，完全粉碎了。他奇襲了數千萬人民的生命財產，他是同人民「鬥爭」「淸算」，如果這一盲動不予制止，轉瞬大汛卽至，災難將不可想像。因此我們願申下列的主張：</p>
<p>（一）願望中共恢復理性，遵守六月中旬簽立的荷澤恊定的諾言，接受聯總河堤五英里內立卽停止軍事行動之建議，撤回盲目的軍隊，與政府及聯總互助合作，於七月內迅速完成黃河復堤工程。</p>
<p>（二）願望聯總動員人力物資，援助水利工程機關，分別緩急，適應安寗情况，逐段完成各口堤工。如果中共以行動拒絕聯總建議，聯總應於發揚正義立塲上，停止中共一切物資的援助，以為違反正義者戒。如果聯總不予膺懲，今後任何國際合作，中共都會捍然不顧的。</p>
<p>（三）願望國軍以迅速行動，消滅和阻止劉伯誠的南竄，保障董口險工的安全，更要警戒共軍在大汛期間，破壞任何一堤一口的險工；否則汛濫橫決，人民生命財產，蕩然無存，三省人民實不堪再受此浩劫。共軍不要人民，國軍需要爭取人民。</p>
<p>總之，黃河大汛已臨危險關頭，搶修堵守，刻不容緩：決不能因中共破壞恊定，坐待桃汛來襲。日月並行，江河不廢，前人已道之：我們希望政府排除萬難，解民倒　。同時我們喚起明達人士　　　，以輿論的力量，以正義的呼聲，壓迫中共軍隊停止軍事行動，則黃河下游人民，始可面臨此危險關頭，免於空前浩刧！</p>
<h3>請問倫敦泰晤士報</h3>
<p>被一般人認為英國統治階級發言的倫敦泰晤士報，近也戴上着色的眼鏡，對我國自厲行全國總動員以來的局勢，有所論列，認為拯救中國所受痛苦之惟一方法，乃在迅速組織眞正約聯合政府。我們不明白現在中國的政府如果不是聯合政府又是什麼？國民黨已不再一黨專政，在野的靑年黨及民社黨現在不也加入了政府？現在中國已經有多黨組成的「國民政府」，實卽是聯合政府；不能因共產黨的不參加，而說我們現在還需要迅速組織眞正的聯合政府。這如果不是對中國的現局勢認識不淸，便又是中了中共惡意宣傳的毒。試問英國亦有共產黨，他們幾曾參加邱吉爾在戰時所領導的「國民政府」；但邱吉爾「國民政府」又何嘗不是聯合政府？</p>
<p>英國多才智之士，但英國人也最容易不自覺地中了中共宣傳的毒。猶憶現任英駐美大使殷浮雀伯勛爵赴美履任之初，還說中國共產黨不是眞正的共產黨，僅是農村改良主義者，這就是中共希望外國人這樣認　他們的宣傳，而英大使郤做了他們的傳聲器。我們為英國的才　　　。如今倫敦泰晤士報的論調，如出一轍，也多少與中共的宣傳不謀而合。我們不相信像這樣有資格的報紙如倫敦泰晤士報者，也會做了中共的傳聲器。要不然的話，為什麼……？</p>

<h3>蘇拒絕參加馬卿計劃後　美增强援歐決心　或將採取平時租借方式　法已竭盡所能謀與蘇聯獲致諒解</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦六日電〕「星期泰晤士報」駐華盛頓訪員頃來電稱：美國援助他國，或將採取平時租借之方式，由「新的最高機關加以管制。蘇聯代表在巴黎三國外長會議所採取之態度，業已加强美國積極援助歐洲擁護馬歇爾計劃之各國云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社夏龍城六日電〕法國外交部長比杜爾今晚在此間發表演說稱：法國已竭盡所能與蘇聯獲致諒解，吾人雖不承認此種分裂係肯定之分裂，但法國　　塲則殊爾顯而意見。法國將與願在和平中重建歐洲之國家，共同前進。馬歇爾國務卿對於歐洲復興臘所提出之建議，實極可稱道，為欲促使美國之援助付諸實現，法國在歐陸實　於極重要　地位，希望人民共和黨能為余努力之後盾云。</p>

<h3>英法邀請參加歐洲會議　捷表示界時接受　惟以獲得更多報告為先決條件</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦六日電〕「倫敦電訊」報今日引捷克京城電台廣播稱：關於英法二國遽請參加十二日巴黎全歐經濟會議對論美國務卿馬歇爾援歐復興計劃一節，捷克政府業已表示暫時接受，但以「先封馬歇爾計劇反其進仃辦法獲得更多報告」為條件。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：捷克權威方面稱，捷克內閣於七日晨舉行會議，討論捷克是否接受英法邀請，參加美國援歐計劃會議。又訊：捷克外長馬蕯里克，將於星期一二前往莫斯科出席會議。又據國外貿易部稱：前往蘇聯談判新商約之商業代表團已於六日出發，部長因病不能出席。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎六日電〕此間人士預料捷克政府要員本週莫斯科之行，可以決定任何東歐國家之將參加二十四國歐洲經濟會議與否。英法所邀之二十二國中，頃悉已有芬蘭拒絕應邀出席，而南斯拉夫·匈牙利及羅馬尼亞預料亦將步芬蘭之後塵。其他被邀國家中已有十四國業已肯定接受邀請或表示願意接受。捷克駐巴黎大使今夜談稱：捷總理戈特華特，外長馬蕯里克定於星期二啓程赴莫斯科。渠聲明關於英法之邀請捷克政府尙未決定接受與否，此間法方負責人士均切盼捷克及其餘東歐國家得以參加本月十二日之巴黎會議而積極參加歐洲之復興計劃。果爾，則蘇聯之隨後加入亦非不可能。</p>
<p>據本社莫斯科來電稱：莫斯科方面咸認東歐國家殆不致參加巴黎會議，蘇聯且猶積極進行經濟自給之政策。今日眞理報之專論，再度指責馬歇爾計劃為擴大社魯門主義，意在組織西歐美國。該文復指英法之建譏為一種威脅。英法所取途徑，與國際合作以及歐洲人民之利益均相抵觸。巴黎觀察家復料捷蘇談判以後，斯抗大國家可能採下列三種行動：（一）捷總理戈特華特將決定捷克不參加巴黎會議，果爾則波蘭以及其地斯拉夫國家亦必採取同一路綫。(二）戈氏或將受蘇聯之鼓勵，會同其他東歐國家參加巴黎會議，採用拖延反阻撓政策，阻止馬歇爾計劃之施行。（三）戈氏或能向蘇聯力陳捷克必須參加美國援助討論，以窺究竟，使東歐國家不致被責為破壞歐洲之復興計劃。</p>

<p>「飛盤」之謎　傳其大如五間房屋　加拿大亦發現同樣怪物</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓州史博根城七日電〕今日消息，謂美國天空之神秘「飛盤」。已有降落於阿達霍州聖馬琍附近之山麓者，據某一瓊森大人稱：渠曾見八片「飛盤」落入樹林中，飛盤係自北方以極高速　飛來，至聖瑪琍附近速度漸退，忽如落業之墮落，然着陸以後，即無影踪，而樹木亦未絲毫受損。飛審狀若圓形洗衣盆，面積約五室房屋一座之大。官方對前項傳說，仍未置信。然加州慕洛克機塲昨曾有噴射式飛機一架，奧里圖州波特蘭亦有快速戰鬥機六架，準備出動追逐此等「飛盤」。華盛頓美陸軍航空隊一官佐告本社稱：陸軍航空隊十天來從事調查「飛盤」之說，迄未查得究係何物。吾人不信國內或國外之任何人能有每小時速　一千二百哩之火箭彈。吾人並未從事任何可以解釋此一　秘物之試騐，亦不知政府內外人員正從事此等試騐。火箭科學家亦如吾人之罔惑不解。一科學作家曾謂前曾在其家中附近見過「飛盤」，但　為飛機　向　機體之反光而已。</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山六日電〕加拿大方面今日　次　告發現「飛盤」。歐洲各國京誠反響表示懷疑，認為比與去年十月　　之「　點火　」類似，見忬不　，其怪自收。按去年十月繼　軍事當局宣佈，　　設備　得有某種「神秘火　」經　瑞　上空，但其性質無法判　。　筆端　，恐係　　蘇聯控　下　　　　的海沿　之火　試騐云。</p>
<h3>法社會黨代表大會　支持賴瑪迪政策　政府願努力使國家趨於安定</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎六日電〕賴瑪迪總理今日在社會黨全國代表大會中致辭，力言法國必須迅速行動，以領導歐洲之經濟復興。渠認惟有響應馬歇爾之計劃從事合作，始能使歐洲國家恢復其經濟之平衡。賴氏於述及蘇聯之拒絕參加馬歇爾計劃時，謂門戶仍保持開放，以待蘇聯之加入。渠乃述及國內局勢，謂政府意欲在發動工潮及動亂之極左份子，與揭起反共旗幟企圖變更共和政權之極右份子之間，保持有秩序之路綫。以言政府之經濟政策，其目標在對抗絕對的國家制及絕對的無控制經濟。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕法國社會黨全國代表大會，昨夜經九小時會議後，以二·五七六票對二·〇五八票，批准賴瑪迪的政府之政策，另一二七票棄權。其他決議案二件：即一保護支援馬歇爾之援歐計劃三呼召國內推行遠大之經濟復興措施。第一決議案中稱，馬歇爾計劃為樹立歐洲復興計劃之獨一無二的機會，並對美國朝野表示感謝。第二決議案中，要求政府平衡通常預算。裁减軍費。抑制通貨膨脹。調查物價。整頓工資。社會黨之參加政府即以國民大會立即授權實施上述經濟方案為條件。</p>

<h3>美名流廿人　反對普遍軍訓</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕參加全國反對徵兵理事會之美國廿名著名人物，六日攻擊杜魯門總統顧問委員會所主張之普施軍事訓練計劃，將眞引起第三次世界大戰，斷送聯合國壽命。該理事會之會員，包括前海軍部長但尼斯，支加哥大學校長赫金，參議員約寞遜，全國農業聯合會主席巴頓，皆申斥此項計劃稱：顧問委員會曾對國人提供諾言，謂美蘇之問如實行攤牌，國家能以備戰方法自救，實足令人震驚。理事會攻擊主張普施軍訓乃為强調國家主義而非國際主義之舉，為此渠等提出代譽　訓之下列方法：一坦白承認美國唯一之安全，乃在取消戰爭。二採取一普遍裁軍計劃。三加强聯合國解決一切世界爭端之力量。四推行對聯合國人民包括蘇聯在內之救濟善後計劃。五以自願受訓代　强迫軍訓，直平世界組織及裁軍完成為止</p>

<h3>國際榖物會議明在巴黎揭幕　五十二國代表參加</h3>

<p>〔新亞社東京七日電〕日國會七日開始自由討論一般政策。各黨選出雄辮家充任質詢發言人，計民主黨選出採用　三（民主黨幹事），自由黨小澤佐重喜（律師），國民恊同黨石田一松（演說家），社會黨土井直作（總同盟幹部），農民黨河口陽一（農業會幹部），共產黨林百郎（律師）等。衆院會議時由各黨代表先就經濟白皮書各發表十分鐘之演說，而由各大臣予以答辯。至其問題之中心，仍集中於食糧政策。又自由黨反對該報告書遏於悲觀。使國民喪失再建之希望。而水谷商相則謂：「事實終屬事實，加以報告，為何不可」。再共產黨之德田則謂報告書中所言之勞動者之生計，全屬胡說。此外自由討論經濟白皮書，今後約二星期間，仍將繼續行之。另一方面，參議院亦自由討論最近政府發表之經濟緊急對策，由各黨派代表八人就政治經濟外交財政問題加以質詢。又改訂鐵道運費，未經國　審議之點，亦成問題，而使政府忙於應付。</p>

<p>日本勤勞大衆亦應忍受犧牲</p>
<p>（二）西尾國務大臣代表首相，對共產黨參議員細川嘉六答辯稱：社會黨並非以　勞階級為犧牲，以保護大資本之利益。但日本目下處於民族危機之環境中，故勤勞大衆亦應忍受痛苦，以　復興。社會黨政策並未低落到自由黨之政策，但社會黨在國會中並未佔絕對多數，其原定政策之不能全部實施，亦屬不得已之舉。</p>

<h3>歐洲人口問題嚴重　對歐陸前途具有重大影響</h3>
<p>— 本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>歐洲今日的人口問題異常嚴重。第一次世界大戰以後兩年，有一百餘萬人離開歐洲。第二次世界大戰以後兩年，祇有極少數的人能够離開歐洲。</p>
<p>據國際難民組織估計，日前歐洲各國無家可歸的難民總數在一百萬以上。此外尙不絕國人九百萬人從東歐彼臨遂出來。除了這批人羣以外。想離開那破碎的大陸的歐洲人是多不勝計的。據若干專家估計，目前有意離開歌洲的人約有一萬萬之衆。</p>
<p>差不多百年以來，一直到一九三〇年止，人們從歐洲大陸源源遷出，到人口稀少的世界各地去。移出的人數時多時少，但沒有停頓過。在近百年中，平均每年有五十萬人移出。</p>
<p>歐洲的經濟和政治危機使移出人數達到了高峯。一八四七年的愛爾蘭饑荒和一八四八年的德國革命把一大羣一大羣的飢民和難民送到安全和自由的區域裏去。東歐的工業革命使大批農民移向都市去，這是最後一次的大移出。</p>
<p>其後新的報界封閉了起來。直到二十世紀初葉，美國收容了歐洲移民百分之八十，移入美境的歐洲人總數達四千萬人。但是一九二一年美國實施移民限制，一九二四年更加緊限制，遂使移民潮流大為减退面轉變了方向。在此後數年中，拉丁美洲的移入人數佔第一位，以加拿大領銜的英國若干自治領吸收了移民的大部分。後來移民限制變成了各國的普遍政策，但是關係更重大的是全世界的不景氣潮流阻斷了各地　業的機會。到了一九三三年回到歐洲去的人數比離開歐洲的人數多。從那時起歐洲的法西斯國家在已有人滿之患的區域裏還拼命增加人口。</p>
<p>度量狹隘和種族仇視是納粹政策的要素。此種仇視異族的心理不自希特勒始，在最初的文化裏早己存在，希特勒的政策不過是變本加厲而已。新的嚴重的人口問題是納粹留給這世界的一份遺產。</p>
<p>的確，今日歐洲的人口問題已到了很嚴重的階段。歐洲今日所遭遇到人口壓迫為有史以來所未有。然而在歐洲境內有幾處地方却急切需要居民和勞工。同時在歐洲以外有許多地方還沒有開發，還能够吸收大量的移民。然而由於這些國家排除外國人和敵對思想，加重了移民的障礙。各國雖都有移民條例的規定，但都附帶限制條款，阻礙外僑的移入。</p>
<p>巴勒斯坦的猶太人會遭遇過歷史上空前的大屠殺。納粹黨會有計劃的殺　猶太人六百萬人，留下一百萬人在歐洲各地（蘇聯除外），其中二十五萬人現住於難民營中，其餘散居於反猶情緒依然高强的各國。這輩猶太人拚命想法回到巴勒斯坦去。</p>
<p>義大利的人口已經　擠到快人爆裂的程度，而且多數是欠　的。義大利人素來喜歡向外發展。自從畢索里尼實施增加人口政策後，義大利的困難加重了許多。戰爭更使糧食和職業發生恐慌。出生人數超過死亡人數平均每年達四十萬人。</p>
<p>因戰爭而流離失所的法蘭人民數數在八百萬人以上，　　數是被納粹冀流徙的，其中七百多萬人已經回到本國去，餘下一百餘萬人仍流浪在歐洲各地，無家可歸。</p>
<p>思想和主義的衝突把歐洲弄得分崩離　。政治亡命者到處皆是。一九三九年從西班牙出亡的西班開人三十五萬餘人，至今仍侷促於法國南部，希望政治澄淸的日子到來，能够重返故鄉。</p>
<p>德國雖受占爭損失，人口却增加一百五十萬人。德國目前的領土只及戰前的四分之三，人民大都是老幼病弱和殘廢的。人口密度為每方哩五百十九人，密度較美國六十二倍。</p>
<p>英國目前最缺乏的是人力，最需要的是煤斤。為了補充　塲，運輸業，紡織業以及其他工業所需要的人力，不得不　用女工和國外勞工。</p>
<p>蘇聯的人口在戰時增加起二千萬人，可是它日前急需勞工七百萬人。蘇聯方面人士承認德國戰俘八十九萬人現仍在蘇聯做工，據局外人估計他們的數日約有三百萬人。</p>
<p>法國日前也正利用德國戰俘以補充因戰爭而捐失的人口　法國現缺少勞工一百四十萬人，希望從義大利，愛爾蘭，阿爾及利亞和德國等處招募來補充。（譯自「世界報告週刋」）</p>
<h3>西班牙公民複决批准王位繼承法　各地投票秩序尙稱良好</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬德里七日電〕據今夜非正式點票結果：西班牙人民已以十對一之大多數，批准王位繼承法案。聯合社統計全國半數以上投票區後，顯示贊成者占五·六六四·九〇四票，反對者三五〇·四七七票，另有一九五·八五五票為空白。</p>
<p>〔路透社馬德里七日電〕西內政部長貝菜士告外國記者稱，西班牙國民昨日投票　決元首繼承法，全國未有一件意外事件。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓六日電〕澳大利亞因不滿美國佔領日本之政策，其與美國之關係頗有發生磨擦之可能。聞至召開對日和會時，澳外長伊伐特將申述種種意見。伊伐特業於星期日赴日考察，　備下月英國將在次培拉舉行之解決日本和約會議，故衆料渠在本週富將親向麥帥發表其反對之意見。美澳雙方糾紛之基本原因乃由於澳處理戰後對日政策，本欲居於主要地位，今則被降於次要地位，故表示憤懣。尤對麥帥之行動，不啻美國單獨主持其事，更感不快。此外，美澳之爭執，尙有下述各端：（一）美國獲得日本大部份貿易，澳堅決反對，上週四所定可至日本經商之私人商行，美國分得一百另二家，澳大利亞僅廿三家而已；（二）麥克阿瑟准許日本至安加島從事開發　　　工作，馬歇爾國務卿加以擁護，澳抗議無效；（三）澳要求在管制期間，日本不得從事民營航空事業；（四）澳不得參加處理日本所應保留之艦隊，表示抗議，澳需要若干艘小型軍艦及漕水　；（五）賠償問題，伊伐特認為遠東委員會非決定此一問題之正當機關，主張留交和平會議討論，伊伐特並深懼該委員會在召開和會之前，或將草擬對日和約。</p>

<h3>五百萬人待援孔亟　成立兩廣賬災會　孫科等聨名招待擴大籌募　盼各界當仁不讓踴躍輸將</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳鐵城。孫科。王寵惠。葉恭綽。王雲五。劉維熾，爲擴大粤災募捐，昨日午後三時，特聯名假康樂大酒樓招待上海各界人士，有所報吿。出席來賓潘公展。徐寄廎·方治·杜月笙·吳蘊初等百餘大。吳市長於開會前到塲，因事匆匆離去，未及與會。吳鐵城·王雲五·業恭綽，因故未及來滬，由孫科·王寵惠·劉維熾代表主持。孫科主席致辭，大意謂：此次兩廣水災之嚴車，較之民四西江之災，尤有過之，廣東受災者連六十縣，災民達數百萬人，如不緊急施救，災黎將不堪設想。行政院已命令救濟總署撥用糧食及賑款，國務會議亦已通過由國家銀特先貸款二百億急賑之緊急　案。再在全國各地及海外廣大募捐。但粤災範圍甚大，據省政府及行轅之估計，第一期急賑即需款三千億之多，故救濟工作須由全國負担，並請滬上各界人士盡力　輸。</p>
<p>救濟費用需五千億</p>
<p>孫副主席辭畢，由梁德超報吿粤省災情，謂民國四年之災，由於西江一江之發水，此次則四江一齊發水，故災情奇重。廣東一百〇八縣之中，受災者共有五十二縣。災民在五百五十萬以上，已算出之死傷人數在五千人以上。廣東一年有雨季收成，現上季收成已完全絕望。水堤等工程被毀者在百分之三十左有。省府首次報吿時，估計救濟費須有三千億，方敷應用。殺近行轅張主任來滬談：除救濟費三千五百億外，修堤費用亦需一千五百億，故共需五千億之巨款，方克有濟。但目前已得之款，僅有國家銀行貸出之二百億，廣州捐款一百億，香港之捐款港幣八十萬元（折合國幣七十億元），誠屬杯水車薪，無濟於事。</p>
<p>災情迫急不容延緩</p>
<p>報告畢，主席團邀社月笙致辭，杜氏體弱，說話畏氣喘，演詞甚簡短，表示救災不分地域，當追隨諸公之後，悉力以赴云云。潘公展繼之演說，大意謂：念及廣東五百萬同胞，在大水中流離失所，衣食困難　之狀，不勝同情。假使每月每人以十萬元維持生活，全數已需五千億元，而以目前生活之逼人，十萬元僅為超碼數目而已。災情迫急，不容延緩。　前上海工商業難不甚景氣，但旣無華北之人禍，亦量兩廣之天災，故上海市民應以同胞一份子之地位，羣策羣力，以救粵災。證以救災之歷史，上海常負責大部份，中國任何一地有災，上海必當仁不讓。此次應繼續以往之救災精神，與各地共同努力，救濟粤災云。</p>
<p>上海各界不能坐視</p>
<p>徐寄廣致辭稱：上海之商業界中，以廣東人寗波人爲主體，今廣東，廣西有災，上海不能坐視。方治致辭稱：廣東爲國父之故鄉，革命之發源地，故國人對廣東災情特別關切。上海市民一定人人盡力，協助受災同胞，市黨部當追隨諸公之後，竭盡棉簿云。繼由吳蘊初，理滄波，秦潤卿，楊嘯天先後致辭，對粤災均表同情，願作最大努力協助救災。</p>
<p>孫副主席擔任會長</p>
<p>上海滇藝協會負責人董天民當塲表示，已召集本市劇藝界人士，組成救濟廣東水災委員會，定本月十六日起，假天蟾舞台義務演戲三天，以收入救災。梅蘭芳，周信芳已同意參加，票價分二十萬，十五萬，十萬三種。至此主席團下寵惠及劉維熾先後表示粤災嚴重，廣西亦有水災，救災如救火，決即成立兩廣賑災會，擬請杜月笙担任理事長，從速進行。經杜氏一再遜謝，乃推孫副主席担任會長，杜月笙，錢新之，潘公展，王曉籟，徐寄廎，方治，吳蘊初，楊嘯天，程滄波，馮有眞，范紹增，顧嘉棠，董幹文，鄭子良夫婦，孫哲生夫人等爲常務與事。並定本星期五午後五時，似上海銀行內舉行首次理事會。</p>

<h3>輸管會與市商會等協商　改進工業原料分配　定貨合同須經審議會複加副署</h3>
<p>〔本報特訊〕本市市商會與工業恊會所組織之工業原料輸入限額分配審議委員會，昨應輸管會限額分配處處長沈奏庭氏之邀，由潘士浩田和卿吳紀春等代表前往商談。雙方為希望分額能合規律起見，均主張同業公會應謹愼從事。根據此項談話，進口商與定戶所訂之合同，原係需要各定戶所屬同業公會簽章證明者，今後將經過審議會複加副署。其積在分配處之申請書及定貨合同，尙未經核辦完竣者將同受此節制。其洋商工廠及商行，應如何與之為合理之分配，昨亦經談及，惟未得具體決議。據有關方面透露消息，有若干商業性之公會，往往輕率為其會員簽章證明，放任其與進口行家訂約定貨。分配旣談不到，即其已經證明之定單共有若干，內容如何，亦無稽考。主管機關對此，深表焦慮。昨日之商談，顯屬與此有關。代表等出後，即於當日下午三時在市商會召集有關化工原料分配之工商業公會四十五單位，經審議會根據各該公會之申報，製成分配率一覽表，當塲通過，成立恊議。其中有三數個公會因早有補充申報，未經列人，將略有修正。化工原料商業同業公會亦派有代表出席，但未有具體辦法參加分配。審議會曾提出十與一之比，俾其於總額內能得十分之一之配額，以轉銷於本市鄰近各地之工業，但未獲恊議。據某權威者語人，工業原料之限額分配，應以扶助工業為主。華北華南華中且另有分酊額。此間販賣商所得者，係作為接濟鄰近省市之用，則以化工業之現狀而言，十與一之比，尙屬相當云。但商業公會方面則以會員衆多，表示為難，日內將再行恊商云。又製革業所用拷膠，昨已與商業公會成立恊議，因內地土法製革之亦有需用，聞已定分配比例為十分之八與十分之二云。</p>
<h3>華股漲勢未衰永紗尤見俏利</h3>
<p>華股昨買戶集中永紗，不及其他。小型股除中法有本身吸收外，倍形軟弱，不進反退。永紗現遞漲達限度者甚早，經過數度掙扎後，終告實行貼價交易。永紗增資前，人心奢望頗濃，趨勢十分倘利。</p>
<p>晨開時人心均好而開高盤，遞永紗開後，由一〇八號一五四號三一號五六號進至一〇四〇〇元。一〇五號九四號一三四號一四二號八九號賣到一〇二五〇左右。一四一號一六〇號八九號一一二號一八三號三五號一六三號五六號均進，盤面甚漲。現永紗首先由一〇九號二三號二〇七號等掛高至漲停，永公　由一八五號二三號七一號二二三號掛漲停，渠永紗在　　半漲到限度，九一號一　號覆升至一〇七〇〇元。二二四號二三二號一〇二號二三一號逢高賣到一〇四五〇元左右，一一七號七八號又進至漲停限度，二二四號二二三號九一號二號二一八號二三二號紛售，難免　　。統益由八九號一四號八七號掛高至漲停，一一七號一五七號三五號八三號再進至進停　，此後小　股若　豐新　景福等，盛極而衰，高後　告　　，而紗則越盤越高，進行　市交易八九號八五號六〇號一九一號一〇二號二二四號三六號一〇四號一五二號均來補轉，暗市喊高至一〇九五〇元。信和由一四號一五二號一八〇號之買通，　激起　　。一五七號二二四號二二八號一度賣到一〇八〇〇元內，水泥由三五號七一號掛高至漲停板，二二三號二二六號一〇二號買意更濃，轉收時漲到一一二五〇元左右，回後略定。最後　一一二〇〇元外結果。中絲在臨收前曾迫漲停，新亞以漲停結果，結果較上週六計永紗　達限度，永公亦然，信和美亞各漲一成光景，中法升成半，　光景編勤興華豐各升半成左右，新華微升，中絲漲停後有回軋升一成　，新亞水泥統　都告漲停，中紡大通商務國貨內衣各漲半成左右，五和跌落一成，景　六業紙告微升。遞交股永紗永公漲停，信和漲一成，新光美亞景福各升半成左右，勤興華豐微升，塲外各老股計南洋五洲華商各漲一成，餘均微升迄半成不等。</p>
<h3>統債外股升降俱微</h3>
<p>公債昨榮辱俱微，過程多盤。統丙晨開七四〇〇元，五三三室五一二室五五五室俱進，漲到八一〇〇元。三六〇室趁勢了結，復回降至七六〇〇元結束。較上週六計甲乙微挫二百元，統丙祗漲一百元，統丁跌一百元，統戊平平。成交稍增至二百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨漲後有回，怡紗晨開雖升為八七〇〇〇元。證券帮及洋商咸了結，退至八二〇〇〇元。廣帮及銀行帮有納，最後在八五〇〇〇元左右徘徊。港方報價稍縮、過程不定，結果較上週六計估紗會德豐業廣微升，紙業微挫，餘均平定。</p>
<h3>紗花布一致挺俏</h3>
<p>紗　昨日棉紗市况，因紗廠開售不多，同業亦少吐出，市氣初開尙平，嗣後各方搜羅甚殷，貨主居　　　，减價猛進。午收結果四二支　　昂至二百萬大關，比之　六激漲一百十萬元。二十支特雙馬為一千二百四十萬元，軋升一百萬元。雙馬紗軋升八十萬元，為一千零九十萬元。其餘三二支藍　銀月，及二十支天女人鐘，十六支光明紅蜂，十支童子軍全　　等　細　，各張三四十萬至七八十萬不等。</p>
<p>布　昨布市以散戶扒吸，業中人振價哄抬，致晨　市　一致挺秀。十二磅起頭細布最後昂至四十五萬七千元，五福四十一萬九千元，三A彩球四十萬零九千元。各　細布，比之週六上升有二三萬元之巨。長江帮對元　豐及直貢呢，均有進取。漂布本街納胃亦健，軋升二萬元許。士林布等廠盤續有調整，做價有二三萬至五六萬元之進展。其他粗布藍布元斜府綢等市，一致堅挺。</p>
<p>花　昨日現棉市况，上午趨勢平靜，午後突趨緊俏。塲內以棉紗再高，人心振奮，　之銀根已鬆，交易頗為活　。紗廠吸胃甚濃，客帮亦多添補，靈賽花上午做開為一九五萬，午後已升至二一〇萬尙少賣出。蓋販戶尙欲續看後市，結果各檔均挺。1／16米特林做開送廠價二四二萬，靈賽一九四萬，一九五萬至二一〇萬，二一五萬。又棧交價7／5米特林二一三萬至二一四萬，大中集細絨一七〇萬，三餘鎭一七〇萬，漢細一八四萬，漢粗一六五萬，又次貨一五八萬，陳漢口粗絨一四〇萬，沙市一九〇萬，冲沙市一八四萬，周浦籽花二八萬五至三十萬，火機一五七萬。</p>

<h3>呢絨夏貨下跌</h3>
<p>呢絨夏貨羽紗呢·派力司·凡立丁·　皮取·白嗶嘰·白直貢等，因廠方出貨充斥，實銷時日步少，前週中本已漸見下游，不料上週因百物紛漲，夏令呢絨竟亦躍漲二成，客本帮買戶因此進胃更懈，而賣方則以實銷時令轉瞬將落，兼欲軋頭襯翻做秋冬貨，昨市莫不賤跌，平均下降一成左右云。</p>
<h3>高白粳略見挺升　食米供求兩平　麵粉內地續降明定暗疲</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千八百餘石，南市先漲後回，結果粳秈米高貨略挺，中次平正，白元去化仍懈，價形平疲，客元中次竟少顧問，北市供求兩平，無甚榮辱。</p>
<p>麵粉晨開貨主頗堅，奈因店方納胃淸懈，內地續降，欲振乏力，市形明定暗軟。洋粉早市開盤見升千餘元，午時頓形乏交。麩皮內地帮略進，回升二一千元，盤旋之局。豆餅汕頭動辦，營口餅猛漲七八千元，廠豆亦加一二千元。黃豆因汕餅俱升，隨之高翔，回漲三五千元。菉豆南洋揀高納取，步挺三五千元，中下平平。赤豆去化不動，再跌萬元。</p>
<p>紅糧到銷兩稀，市勢暫平，苞米亦少上落。芝蔴洋莊採辦，物稀為貴，節節上漲，飛騰二萬元。生仁華南猛烈搜購之下，扶搖直上，奔騰二萬餘元。蠶豆客銷略動，挺進三五千元。小麥內地步削，隨之不振，僅小型粉廠略有成交，價格續跌三五千元，阜豐福新尙無意購納。</p>
<p>食米買賣應先登記</p>
<p>又訊：據悉：日來各大戶及客販暗中脫售米糧者頗多，故米市不無有塲外交易，此等情事，長此以往，難免發生意外。市政當局及米業公會頗寄予重視。昨據米市塲管理委員會負責人稱：嗣後凡任何米糧，擬即出賣者，均須於事前向該市塲申請登記，不得任意在市塲及塲外私自買賣云。</p>
<p>榨油辦法業經決定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局最近自東北運到大豆一批，計二千三百噸，業已決定委託榨油業公會各會員廠榨油。規定每担大豆須榨油七斤半，豆餅一·八七張。中信局給付各廠工繳，以大豆每担二萬元計算。所榨之油，將由民食調配且決定配售辦法，由中信局負責出售。至豆餅出售辦法，則將由中信局自行決定云。</p>
<h3>買方紛紛搜購　人造絲價激漲　廠經綢貨亦見高昂</h3>
<p>人造絲瘋狂上漲，昨市上午尙稱平穩，二一〇號高山有光二千七百四十萬元開盤，中午八百二十萬元收盤，下午因綢廠帮為聯營公司料貨人造絲已無貨可發，須墊購織造，紛紛向黑市搜購，以致造成空前高價，漲風之厲，令人咋舌。午後即升至九百八十萬元，最後竟高達三千零五十萬元有成交。東洋及天橋等比上週末俱漲起三百八十萬元之鉅。七五號半光喊價已叩四千萬元，物稀居奇，漲無止境，綢廠商頗受影響。</p>
<p>廠經昨市亦稍堅昂，高勻度五担頭D字等級有成交，價做三千三百萬元。E字等級貨身較次者，昨市做價一百七十萬元，高級另担D字貨成交價三千二百五十萬元、干經昨亦有交易，上身另担價做二千一百萬元，五担頭未曾做開，喊價亦已提高。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市以眞絲被面為最俏，美亞被面喊價達一千四百萬元，但未成交。大誠被面開市做一千二百七十萬元，後又漲起十五萬元。華强被面先一千二百六十萬元有成交，後則高至七十五萬元有人要。大誠格子壁　因漸感落令，故欲漲無力，昨市即期價最大四萬一千八百元，最小一千二百元亦有成交，最後為一千四百元，與上週末價無甚上落，隔日期價一千六百元。人絲貨華錦縐下午因原料飛跳，無貨應市，喊價在二萬八千元之譜，其餘各貨，因交易甚稀，價均堅持未動。</p>
<h3>桐油猪鬃兩項輸出品　由中信局負責購銷　已成立審價委會進行一切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府當局為謀桐油與猪鬃之源源輸出起見、已委託中央信託局負責辦理此二種出口貨品之收購與銷售事宜。中信局接奉此項委託命令後，已於局內設立審價委員會，逐日審定購銷之價格與數量，輸出推廣委員會為督導此項購銷事宜，亦指派代表參加。關於購銷方式，除由中信局總局向商家收購及售予出口商外，並得由該局各地分局及國外代理行家直接辦理。凡向該局購買桐油猪鬃者，以出口商為限，且必須以外幣付價。經營桐油猪鬃之商家及出口商，應隨時與中信局易貨處保持聯系，該處將盡力予以便利。上項辦法係全國適用，中信局及其他各地分局，已奉命向上海，天津，靑島，漢口，重慶，萬縣，長沙，及梧州等處商家實行收購。並在上海，天津，廣州三處售予出口行商。惟目前天津廣州兩地分局，對於當地行商詢價及探詢有關出口其他問題時，應先向上海總局請示，總局方面亦當儘速答覆。再上項辦法及政府推進七種主要貨品出口貿易計劃之一部，該項計劃業經行政院批准、除桐油猪鬃外，其他各種貨品之詳細辦法，現正由有關當局分別擬具中，一俟核定，亦將儘速實行以打開目前輸出貿易之僵局。</p>
<h3>食糖上落互見</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平，上落互見。公會劃盤二〇中砂白初為五十九萬元，後為五十八萬六千元，升萬餘元。台赤五十五萬六千元，升六千元。汕揭陽靑四十二萬元至四十二萬元至四十二萬五千元，升七千元。棉赤四十五萬五千元至四十六萬三千元，刁靑鬃為三十七萬五千元至三十七萬元，興化白五十五萬五千元至五十六萬元，小萬餘元。興赤四十五萬元，小一二萬元。次者僅四十一萬元，共成交大百餘件。</p>
<h3>茶市去化穩定　溫州毛紅價堅俏</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，交易雖仍狹隘，但趨勢由靜帶穩。因一部份出口商對於向銷非洲之抽珍。珍眉等花色，續在騐看中，是以人心尙好。紅綠茶內銷，值此驕陽肆虐中，莫不逐步砌加，仍以溫州毛紅茶，楓涇·嘉善一帶，更有進胃，過程愈益活躍，做開行情均稱俏秀。</p>
<p>廣東帮需求不　之上白貢菊，因賣戶扳抬，故態復萌，情况轉寂。又據業中人云：本年度婺源新炒靑，貨主鑒於連日到源滯化，而求者尙殷，故紛紛派員赴產地搬運。乃邇來彼地茶市亦轉起色，聞刻下產價每担已哄至四十五萬元。綜觀此種情形，前途猶有扶搖直上之勢。</p>
<h3>中樞期望紡調會　迅速確定調節方案　國行張總裁昨召集談話會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉紗市價，日來又節節上漲。中樞當局，對此備極關注。認為自組設紡調會後，雖曾迭次召開會議，惟整個紗布調節方案，迄未產生。以目前棉紗市價趨勢言，短期內確立明快調節政策，即付執行，實屬至要。</p>
<p>昨日下午五時許，中央銀行張總裁，為此特召集第六區棉紡公會理監事及紡調會委員等，舉行談話會，擬就當前實施棉紗調節政策時種種困難汝懸案，分別予以解決。聞談話經過，原則已決定，各點如次：</p>
<p>（一）本年四五六月份中，核配予各廠之行總外棉六萬餘包，所產棉紗三萬二千餘件，各廠應於一週內，提交紡調會。其收購價律以廿支紗每件六百五十萬元為標準。（二）第一季限額外棉所紡之紗，本定歸政府收購半數。現決由政府退還各廠已繳棉款之半數，並按市計給拆息。而第一季限額中之半數棉花，改由政府發給各廠代紡，政府另對各廠計給合理工繳及利潤。至第二季限額外棉，現因各廠付款者不多，決由政府全部發還。所有該季限額外棉，全歸政府發給各廠代紡。</p>
<p>此外對工繳如何決定，議價如何遵守等問題，亦曾提出討論。又據六區棉紡公會表示：該會會員廠繳紗提供共伺配銷者，刻已有八千包，日內即可繳足一萬包云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕紡調會本定昨日上午舉行成品運銷及議價等小組會，後各委員因若干懸案，尙待與國行張總裁商決後，方有遵循端倪，昨乃宣告流會，並延期至今日上午十時舉行。明日上午九時，則將舉行第四次委員會議云。</p>
<h3>肥皂買多價升</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂市面，晨開殊稱挺俏，尤以日光皇市氣更秀，因聞南杭兩帶客戶有委託代收之說，故喊買之聲不絕。祥茂固本箭刀光華等皂，市上實需亦殷。加以業外囤購，　碼甚緊，而貨主更以居奇，各貨挺升頗勁。午市結果，固本皂每箱激漲至五十萬零五千元，箭刀皂四十九萬五千元，黃祥茂卅三萬八千元，光華皂三十一萬元。其餘亨利牛牌日月鼎蜂等皂價，均比上日軋昂五六千至一萬六七千元不等。</p>
<h3>行總第三批外幣　核配辦法已定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行總第二批外棉十萬零七十九包，刻已抵埠。輸管會外棉核配委員會第十次委員會議，業已參照本年第二季五至七月外棉限額，決定該批外棉分配各廠辦法，送交行總參考辦理。各廠紡錠設備，仍規定須在三千枚以上煮，始予核配。統計本外埠各紗廠，可配得該項外棉者，有申新等八十五家。一俟接奉通知，即可向行總接洽。查各廠攤配之包數，以中國紡建公司佔首位，共得四四九八九·三八包。次為永安一二三四五廠，共得五三六六·一三包。再次為申新九廠，共得三二四九·二三包。</p>
<h3>捲烟市氣挺秀</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市氣轉告穩秀，蓋以各項公用事業價格均將調整，捲烟稅亦跟　增加，廠方出品成本加重，廠盤陸續提高，是以塲中買氣甚旺。又以外埠同行暫停拋吐，籌碼枯竭，市勢異常激昂。</p>
<p>十支大英烟初開為七百六十萬元，其後一度回低，但不久買戶蠢動，價乃反見勁俏，午市塲中一片買聲，求過於供，步做步高，最後十支大英烟比（星期日）午收價激漲四十萬元，為七百九十二萬元。老刀六百九十二萬元，亦昂卅七萬元。五華哈德門上升一二十萬元，頤中公司之十支廿支前門烟，及大南未大三砲走勢甚健，每條軋漲一千五百元至二千六百元。華商烟美麗金鼠銀行三貓等牌，亦大都進展。美貨駱駝六根馬力斯等條烟，及五十支聽頭烟，市情亦呈堅穩。</p>

<h3>煙江使愁波上人　踏勘桂南水災</h3>
<p>— 南寗一日航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>多愁善病</p>
<p>整整一個月來，廣西完全沉浸在傾流不盡的落雨中，一片愁雲過後，，接着又是一片愁雲，低氣壓迫榨出多少絕望的哀號，漫天洪水，奔騰呌嘯，如狼似虎，河道千里崩裂，橫衝直掃，從南北盤江一直傾瀉到珠江三角洲，犬地茫茫，田土陸沉，葬送了多少生命財產，北地兵禍，南國白災，刀槍之餘，天譴相繼，小百姓活不下去了！……。</p>
<p>為了讓相與苦難的同胞更詳盡地明白近百萬兄弟姊妹怎樣在水底下輾轉呻吟，記者在漫天風雨中走出了桂林，又在漫大風雨中靜奪走入柳州，再走向珠江上游白浪滔天的區域，越近災區一步，心裏也越沉重一分。</p>
<p>從桂林到柳州，自從湘桂黔鐵路桂柳段修復後，本來四百多里的路，朝發可以夕至，可是費煞苦心修復的道路橋樑，却經不起一塲大水，不是今天這條便橋倒了，便是明天那個涵洞坍了，這條路，有人比之為鐵路中的林黛玉，多愁多病，所以火車誤點不是新聞，不誤點報紙才會升　「今日火車準時到達」。記者來柳時適遇雒容橋被水冲倒，火車只開到　容岸（一個距柳州數十里的小縣城」，再渡河駁車，由另一列車推入柳州，火車而有「駁車」，其中多少辛苦，可以想見。</p>
<p>桂北高原像萬人塚</p>
<p>桂北高原，人為的災害重於水災，沿途尙可見田隴禾苗正秀——往年已是新榖登塲的時候——越往下行，便覺千百凄凉景像步步逼人而來，踏入柳州，時近黃昏，靜靜的雨夜裏，彳亍街頭，只有追逐在身後的小呌化子，却倍蓰於去年今日，淸晨起來，漢步街頭，一羣「馬路天使」靜靜的睡在人行道上，從培新路口擺到培新路尾，橫三個，豎五個，破碗竹筒還緊緊抱在懷裏，咧着牙，閉着眼，看去簡直像走入萬人塚，唉！</p>
<p>小鎮人市　哭望水田</p>
<p>四鄉水流，蟲害交侵，柳州北上的一個有名的小鎮，直到今天，已經無形建立了一個極熱鬧的人市，逃荒無術的農民，不忍舉家同歸於盡，往往寗願以十五萬左右的價錢，將兒女全部賣出，然後拿了錢，還淸了借種下田的債，然後帶着悲愁的限光，望一望水深三尺自費心血的水田，便遷到山裏去束手閑住，一直等到水退。剜却心頭肉，連眼前瘡都補不了，兩年來的景像相同，然而兩年來死去的人却已是另外一批。</p>
<p>我的住所正對着柳河，一千字稿還沒有寫完，河水已經連起了三次，碼頭夫捱着雨點，流着汗水，把大河的浮橋跳板加了又加，哼哼喲喲，房子背後的「肉市」也正在低聲地討價還價，偶然一陣肉麻的浪笑掀起，立刻又給傾盆的雨聲蓋沒了。</p>
<p>從柳州走向南寗，只不過是一天的事，以一天的時光，把眼光移動在瘡痍滿目的道路上，，實足使人深思無限，一年時光，好的沒有更好，壞的却越來越壞，從珠江的汜濫，看人民的愁苦，其間多少事景，不足為外人道，「新鬼煩寃舊鬼哭，天陰雨濕聲啾啾」，此等情狀，大可在廣西每一個角落尋覓得到……。</p>
<p>桂南九縣　洪水滔滔</p>
<p>躅在邕江大河畔間，凝望着一堆兩堆洪潦退後殘留的淤泥，此際心情，亦不知是恨是怨，但覺眼底是一片黃水，耳間是一串嘆息，腦海是一陣陣奔命的呼號，六日之間，以走馬看災的方式，遍歷桂南九縣——賓陽·南寗·武鳴·果德·隆安·同正·橫縣。永淳——不期然而對滔滔洪水起了一種無名的恐怖，　雨連月的結果，上述各地抽綫就熟的稻禾，半數以上為水淹死，總數不下五十餘萬畝，踏過田隴，看着一畝一畝的田裏倒睡着發霉了的新穀，真有說不出的惋痛。果德·　結等地，本極貧瘠，——該縣除了縣府和參議會·衛生處為磚瓦築成之外，全條「大街」，都是茅草蓋搭——此次水禍正在新穀成熟，包粟結實之際，山洪暴發，倚山而植的心血全部化為烏有，外逼於大河，裘困於山水，卒至顆粒無存，農民奔撲逃生，多瀕絕境，災民數在五十萬以上，率為無家可歸，嗷嗷待哺之輩，而有關方面極飢救溺之輩，迄尚未有所舉措，遂至邕垣米價貧一度高　到廿七萬元百斤，創廣西的米價紀錄，目今洪水漸返，蕩然無存的人回到了田龐旁，咬一咬牙關，又以一開二的「榖花」——種高利貸，借穀一担，收成時還穀兩担至三擔—撒種下田，再賭一次命運，在武鳴雙橋附近看見農胞揷秧正忙，偶然問一問一個正在自己以全力拖着耕犁的老伯：旁邊的秧田是否「二造」！——即第一次收成後，續作二次插秧，九十月間再收割的禾稻。——那老傢伙答覆得又幽默又沉痛，道末說：「二造是二造，可惜頭造給天兵來割去了」！</p>
<p>女孩出售　頸繞紅綫</p>
<p>廣西地土貧瘠，人民本來早就苦透，再加上這末千災百難，簡直血淚俱枯，邕色路上，不知看見多少光着上身，穿着一條又破又爛內褲的女人，蹲在田裏做工，渾身晒成一塊炭團，如果不是一頭「烏雲」和兩個乳房，簡直不知道她們是一些窮得那未精光的女人。偏偏却在這些顧命不暇的人羣裏，每每有一些好大喜功的「父母官」們，為了要亟亟樹立自己「有目可見」的「政績」，便今天拉一批人去修縣道，明天拉一批人去興一點莫明其妙的水利，（如思樂縣為了興修一條直達越南邊境的火路，竟不惜在農事正忙時候，抽集精壯動工，）弄到農民丟了犁扒，拿起鋤頭，疲於奔命，却趕不出一個所以然來，田事荒蕪，輸官復無盡日，因此困者益困，同正扶南等也，賣兒　女者成羣強隊，每一名均以歲數計，約一萬五千元至二萬元一歲，十七八歲的大姑娘，卅萬塊錢便拿得一個。</p>
<p>到果德時，看見街中有頸繞紅綫，席地而坐的女孩子多人，聚見之下，還以為這是一種裝飾，誰知一問之餘，這條工綫原來便是「商口」的票幟，每人最高價為包三百斤。</p>
<p>果德等縣　災情最慘</p>
<p>災荒的確實數目字，到今天還沒人弄得淸，水退了，一塲大雨後，新氾又起，漲漲落落，據說總要過了中秋才得穩定，究竟三個月內的事如何，誰也不敢保險，刻下各地正在着手密切調查損失詳細數目，準備呈請急賑，據記者大體調查，災情當推果德·鎭邊·靖西·平治等縣最為慘重，果德全縣人口不足六萬，而「不見米糧見草根」者竟達三萬零七百餘人，畬田全數冲沒，顆粒無望，靖西西北南坡等廿餘鄕中，飢民塵集三萬餘人，有一處呌做平穩鄕的，最不平穩，竟至舉鄉入山砍取檳榔樹枇杷樹葉充飢，被伐者不下數千株，因砍樹而筋疲力盡跌死山谷者日有所聞。尙有小孩七人，掘得木薯一堆，高高興興燒了來吃，不及吃完，便全體中毒而死。其餘如鎭邊縣災民亦逾三萬，全縣收成不及一成，羣相以水藻豬菜度日，縣屬三篷鄕因不耐飢餓而自殺者，一日竟達十二人。鎭結縣災民亦達二萬，雜糧被水冲毀過半，領得賑款三百萬元，計每人可得一百四十餘元左右。隆山縣附廓七鄕全部陸沉，飢民迅增至八千餘戶，四萬人伸出求救的手，三萬六千畝土地全部失收，弄到有錢無米可買，有人無處逃生，推及平治田東等縣，莫不是有田皆水，無地不浸，老百姓草根吃盡，吃到山薯，山薯吃盡，吃到木棉樹皮，樹皮吃盡，吃到木棉樹根，好運氣的偶然挖到幾根毛竹的筍子，便是一頓大餐。飢餓驅人，往往成羣結隊，偸到水未淹及的畬田中倫挖花生芽，雜糧充飢，卻　被防守者高据山頭，一場掃射，在田東·平治·果德三縣交界的地方，這樣的慘案，不知演了多少。</p>
<p>自邕寗循江而下，永淳·橫縣·沿河各鄕，亦莫不為波神所及，蒲廟一鄕甘蔗·花生雜糧被淹萬餘畝，橫縣各鄕如江口·南鄕等地損失亦在五萬畝　全，下達貴縣南江一帶，原爲廣西唯一之產糖區域，而今蔗田亦紀大部因災淹沒殆盡，未被淹者亦因久雨以至蟲害一發不可收拾，今年農民何以為生，簡直不堪聞問！</p>
<p>剜肉補瘡　寃抑難伸</p>
<p>災荒之前，各地本有倉儲榖設備，以應非常，然而大坻却是在百姓等着要米時，榖米却無緣無故走入了土豪劣紳的手上把持着，從而以救民於水火的榖、作拯救腰包之急務，高到不可再高的高利貸把戲，便從這批人手下演開來，二萬元的債，到九月要一擔榖，老百姓也只有剜肉補瘡，拿自己平日送去的儲穀，却要自己送十倍的利錢，如此寃抑，眞不知從何說起！至於往年作作狀的那些急賑隊之類，今年却己是廣陸絕響，亦足使難民頗有「撫躬自憐，天下惻隱之心何在」之感，不過，這些都算小事情了。西江水位最高時，曾達八十公尺，水勢日來稍稍下退，開已可至不足再度爲患之境，故此邋日物價均曾下跌，尤以南寗米價從廿六萬一跌跌到十四萬元為最高速度之下降，因此人心亦較已趨向安定，雖然永遠是風聲鶴唳的十萬大山裏的强梁一再威脅着這一片空虛的土地（盤據靈山果的所謂民主聯軍，日前曾有一部竄入桂境權縣水淳一帶，造成一個頗為緊張緊張的局面），</p>
<p>觀此次水患，珠江上游的境遇，並不見得比下游三角洲的禍害更　，其間分別，只不過是一個首當其衝而一個則集禍害的大成而已。愈樣謀治標的救濟，自然一百個脫不了一個錢字，治本的工夫，則更有待商榷，舉一個例，記者驅車桂邕道間，都千餘里，數”來盤桓於叢山之間，除了牛山濯濯，光禿禿一片外，毫無所見，自柳州至遷江二百公里中，僅發現桐油樹一株，實有「林木難得」之慨，事在人為，要防患眞不是喊喊可了的事，何况老百姓還有那末多說不出的話？……。</p>
<h3>巴德森爵士談：新型監獄</h3>
<p>— 萊汀六月廿四日航訊　往仁</p>

<h3>分娩中的印回現勢</h3>
<p>— 新德里廿八日航訊　本報特約記者　周祥光</p>
<p>記者於五月上旬，曾經寫過一篇通訊，指明印回必將分治，時僅一月，印回就開始分治了。六月三日英政府還政於印的聲明，就是印回分治的大憲章。大憲章之五要點如下：</p>
<p>憲章要點</p>
<p>（一）本年二月二十日，英政府聲明於一九四八年六月還政於印，原盼印度各政黨能按照英國會代表團方案，共同擬訂憲法，成立統一印度，此願今己成為泡影。</p>
<p>（二）目前之制憲會議，回盟佔大多數的省份，如孟加拉，旁遮普信德諸省，及英屬俾路支斯坦，均米派遣代表出席，將來該會所判定之憲法，誠恐不能為上述諸省所採納。為尊重該區之民意，彼輩是否加入現在之制憲會議或另一制憲機構，此點應由各該省人民，自行決定。</p>
<p>（三）一俟一個或一個以上的政權，由上述辦法產生後，英國政府即於本年內，以自治領的地位，授予印人。</p>
<p>（四）關於仰回兩族人數不相上下的孟加拉與旁遮普兩省，其省議會應劃分兩個單位，其一代表回民佔多數的省份，其一則為其餘各縣代表所構成，此二單位應分別集會，如任何一造中贊成分家，那末該省即應實行分治。</p>
<p>（五）西北邊省，重行複決。</p>
<p>各黨同意</p>
<p>當日此種新計劃提出後，印度的國大黨，回教聯盟與錫克民族，碍於環境之下，同意接受了，遂於六月三日晚上由印督廣播上述計劃後，乃開治由各黨領袖致詞，首為國大黨代表尼赫魯氏說明：「統一不可以强迫，瓜分是聯合之母」。語至沉痛，句句動人。次由回盟領袖眞納說明：「該項計劃雖不盡合吾人之初願，但總須協議，惟回盟是否願意接受，尙待回盟執行委員會最後通過，目前希望印回人士和平相處，萬不可有所爭閙」。詞句沉着，而有深意。最後則由錫克旅代表，臨時政府的國防部長巴德夫辛衡氏說明：『印度分治不會長久，將來仍須合作」對於未來的印度寄着無窮的希望。</p>
<p>四千年古國的印度從此分成兩個國家了，一為印度斯坦（國大黨不願意用此名字，仍保留印度之名），一為巴基斯坦（義為回敎聖地）自六月三日起到今天（六月四四日止）孟加拉與帝遮普兩省，經巴基斯坦，西旁遮普則屬於西巴基斯坦，現在尙未決定者，為阿蕯密的西蘿縣Syytlet毗連東孟加拉為阿人多數區，須經表決，是否加入巴基斯坦或印度斯坦，不過依記者看來，該縣必屬於東巴基斯坦無疑，表決不過形式吧了。</p>
<p>所最為印回關心者，唯西北邊省之複決耳。此點容後述之。</p>
<p>避免流血</p>
<p>前面我已說過，真納尚須將新計劃提交回盟執委會討論，是否同意接受的問題，實際上眞納是回盟的狄克推多，他說是，大家說是，他說否，大家說否，這是我們在印度的人都會知道的，因為回盟的高級份子，如財政部長阿里可汗等，都是他一手提拔出來的，眞納今年已是七十二歲了，他與尼赫魯的父親是老朋友，他所做的事情，沒有一個人能敢反對的回盟的力量能統一，這未始不是個原因。但國大黨的高級人員，大家都是老朋友，所以遇有重要事情，大家必須商量商量，尼赫魯在國大中，并非一個實際操權的人。回盟乃於六月十日在新德里帝國大厦召開會議出席者有四百多人，一致通過接受新計劃，並授權眞納，去處理和應付將來的一切。當真納主持開會時，萬千回民高喊着：最高領袖眞納是巴基斯坦的沙亨沙Shahan　Shar（為大皇帝）眞納老頭兒聽到了，心中怪不舒服的，他說，我不是皇帝，我是個巴基斯坦的老戰士呵！這亦是會議中的一個趣聞，生色不少。</p>
<p>國民大會黨繼回盟之後，於六月十五日開執行委員會議，討論接受新計劃問題。是日國大黨諸領袖均到，甘地翁亦在座。經一塲烈辯論之後，大會以一五七票對二十九票的多數而通過了。贊成接受的理由中，最扼要的點，是寗可以分裂，以求和平。不忍强制統一，以再見宗派鬥爭流血的慘劇。這一點是值得我們欽佩的，國大黨向來主張獨立，和平（非暴力）與統一。現在犧牲統一，以求獨立之速成，望和平之早現，足見其相忍爲國的苦心。這當然也因為回盟沒有百萬軍隊，才可以做到的呵。</p>
<p>這個英政府的新講劃，今日已經印度兩大政黨同意了；說來奇怪，保守黨的死硬派邱吉爾也同意了，他在六月十一日，於倫敦葉印協會中演說，認為英國工黨政府對印慶政策，『在大體上是完全對的！」後來把蒙巴頓總督稱道了一番，說他在印度立了大功，同時這大功也屬於派他做總督的那個人哩！這回邱老確實是明是菲講道理，不像從前政府若說對的，他決說不對，政府說不對的，他決說對的，那種死硬心腸了。</p>
<p>西北邊省</p>
<p>現在要說到西北邊省了。西北邊省的人民差不多十分之九是回教徒，但內閣卻是國大黨所操持，且印度人民因為財產上的限制，能有選舉權的非常的少，因此去年舉行大選　時，在國大黨內閣指揮之下，獲得勝利，西北邊省願追隨印度斯坦，此點回盟是不甘心的，因此今年以來，西北邊省不斷的發生流血慘案，尼赫魯到西北邊省，也被當地人民石擊，攪得頭破血流，所以在新計劃中，英國提出再度複決，此點對回盟是有利的，但國大黨明知道若經複決，回盟能勝利的，因此參加國民大會黨的西北邊省回民領袖可汗阿伯陀羅格番可汗（簡稱邊圖甘地）主張西北　省中，要成立巴德斯坦，旣不屬印度斯坦或巴基斯坦，是個獨立國家，此點即將西北邊省再行劃分，如孟加拉省然，眞納對此自不願意，當西北邊省在發生流血慘劇時，所有印度敎及錫克族人都離省他去，此輩人士於複決之時，回盟不請他們回來參加，同時眞納已派其高級人員周德梨迦君，他現任臨時政府的商業部長到邊省去計劃一切，真納亦於複決時前往，依此看來，回盟勢非獲得西北邊省，決不安心的。照記者看來西北邊省必定屬於巴基斯坦的。不過回盟要費一番心血吧了。</p>
<p>土邦前途</p>
<p>印度旣已分家了，那麽在印度境內的，還有五百零六個的土邦則如何辦法呢？因為英政府將政權交還印人後、同時放棄對印度土邦的特權，以及此後各土邦有充分自由決定自己的前途，因此，過去猶豫不決之土邦、被迫採取下列三條途徑，（一）參加國大黨的憲憲大會，（二）準備參加巴基斯坦的制憲大會，（三）穴佈獨立。據近日看來，若千大土土決定其自己前途，如梅莎土邦巳參加國大制　會　，海特拉巴與多羅芬科二　　自己宣佈獨立，惟迦濕彌羅土邦尙未決定，因該邦多係回人，是土王却是印度敎，將來或許參加巴　斯坦制憲大會。但目前國大黨與同盟都一致向印督進　讓土邦自由行動，不無危險。故將來土邦勢必走向制憲會議之途上去，或許土邦從此而漸漸消失了。</p>
<p>回盟自獲得巴基斯坦自治領地位後，積極進進行成立政府事宜，回盟巳決定擇信德省的省會喀拉基作為巴　斯坦的首都、東巴基斯　的　府尙未擇定，大概總以吉大港或達卡二地擇之，中央政府各部人事方面亦在分家，所有中央官員應即填表說明，願在印度斯坦或巴基斯坦政府服務，據目前統計，大槪中央政府的回人，差不多百分之九十九願到巴基期坦的，其他如軍事邊界，財政，交通等項，均已設立小組委員會、計劃瓜分事宜。</p>
<p>法葡屬地</p>
<p>印度的大陸上，雖說是英國的屬地，實際上還有幾處是屬葡萄牙與法蘭西的，因此法國見英國還政於於印人後，法屬印度總督梅良亦於本月六日在法屬印度首都本地治理Pondicherry招待記者，預示法屬地將有重要的害政改革，他說：「法屬印度統治機當然是歸於當地人民」。又云：「我與駐印法公使羅斯拜訪尼赫魯，幷向尼氏報告印法文化交換發展計劃，我說法國重視偉大的印度民族友誼，除此而外，無政治上或經濟上的慾望，法國的願望，是把法屬本地治理成為印法文化溝通之地點」。從此，未來法國已決心將法屬印度土地交還印人。惟葡屬印度果阿GOA則經葡政府申明決不交還印度，一若葡所佔之中國　門決不交還中國然，眞是一件憾事。</p>
<p>一個妙喻</p>
<p>印度就這麽樣的分治了，魏非爾將軍對此曾有一個妙喻，他在倫敦東印度協會上言「印度現在是受蒲產前的痛苦，一切分娩都是不愉快的，尤其是誕生的是雙生子」。這一對雙生予，一名呌巴基斯坦，一名呌印度斯坦，後者的名字，國大黨是不承認的，但不論呌什麽名字，　生子是快要呱呱墮地了。照譚雲山教授的比喻，印度受的產前痛，中國受的產後捕，總之，產前產條痛都是一樣的厲害，我們希望如一切分娩一樣，都是短期的痛過以後，我們再來慶祝一番吧！</p>
<h3>航業復興前瞻</h3>
<p>— 周簡</p>
<p>古今史例，民族窮蹙，則保於山，發展則資於水。我國位於太平洋之西，海岸綫蜿蜓曲折，長達萬里。沿岸居民，勇敢進取，有斯地理環境及民族習性，允宜縱橫海上，稱雄實　。惜以往資水之利未盡，故樂生之具不備，而御侮之力不充。數十年來備受外力壓迫，民生凋疲。國勢凌夷！</p>
<p>茲者抗戰勝利，海權規復。百刦餘生，痛定思痛，前塵回首，猶有餘悸。戰後萬端待舉，而我航業界同仁凛於航運與國運之關係，交通為建設之基礎，經集中全力，迅速恢復戰前船舶噸位，協助復員運輸。其間歷經困難，而於航運之拓展，航權之維護，航業合作之促進以及日本賠償船舶之交涉等等無不時刻在念，努力以赴。顧推輪積水，僅為濫　，今後日進不已，航業　興，復有何欵？</p>
<p>筆者與春申闊別，將及十年。前次來滬參加船聯發起人會議，一路波光萬里，沙導飛翔，河山明媚，無與倫比。乃甫抵淞濱首先觸現於吾人眼簾者則為外國之　　巨艦，旗幟招展，雄視江上。觀本國艦隻，則一無無所見。所謂國防，於何有哉？再次，本國商輪，現雖復達八十萬噸，櫛比鱗次於黃浦江濱，數亦不少。</p>
<p>上一將為吾國航業中心，有東方大港之譽。航畢界各領袖高瞻遠矚，戮力本身業務之餘，進而謀全國同業之合作。登高一呼，羣山皆應，集四方之英彥謀萬舟之共濟。此種熱情與努力，實値吾人特別歡欣鼓舞而致其無上欽敬之忱，寄與航業州前途無窮之望！</p>

<h3>論曹操的死史犀之一</h3>
<p>— 譚正</p>
<p>記得幼時在私塾裏讀書，曾經在一本石印的繪圖三字經上看到一幅『王季弒兄圖』，一個古衣冠的人乎特寳劍，正在一所大殿上追殺另外一個穿着同樣衣冠，而正在　　逃避的人。這印象至今還深紫在我的腦子　。後來又在史　　讀到『太甲弒父』『王季弒兄』等等傳說，便以為荒各古時代，即有其事，亦何足怪·可是後來工證到許多學者們的議論，以為這種事，離經叛道，有害世道人心，所以力闢為異端邪說，荒誕不經，勸人萬萬不可置信。那時的我，使也深信不疑，以為學者們的話一定很有道理的。</p>
<p>後來又多讀史籍，在它們之後，又發現了兩件相同的事：一件是東漢末年的曹丕「以子弒父』，一件是宋初趙匡義的『以弟　兄」；後者為各種史籍所明載，前者却是我在細看「三國志」注後發現的，我曾經把這發現寫人我的劇本『洛神賦』第五幕裘。（這劇本曾給某號稱前進女伶領導的某劇團改為越劇的形式演出，而我却在她們演出後一年多才知道。我並不客惜我的上演權，我所惜的是我這個重大的發現却始終沒有引起人們的注意。）我知道了這兩件事後，便以為時代比較前進的漢宋旣可有之，那麽在荒古時代的商周為什麼反而不會有？於是重又把我從前盲從的相信完全推翻，以為那些都不是什麼荒誕不經的事。</p>
<p>為了要使大家都知道我這個『曹丕弒父』的新發現，而且共同來充賓我這個新發現的證據，所以我把我所依據的一些不很充實的設據引述出來，供愛好探討這種間題的人共同研究。</p>
<p>要知道曹丕為什麽要弒父，必須先要明白他和他父親曹操，弟第曹植之間的三角關係。歷史告訴我們，曹操有着許多的兒子：大兒子曹昂死於宛城張繡之變，二兒曹丕是個詩人，三兒曹彰是位猛將，四兒曹植也是一位詩人，其餘的兒子都沒有什麼事跡可見。可是同樣是詩人，曹植為人忠厚，曹丕為人奸猾，所以做父親的却是歡喜曹植的。而且在征　之役，曹操的目的物甄氏被曹丕捷足奪去後，他對曹丕的反感更深；所以等到他進位丞相，封了魏公之後，便有立　植為世子的意思。可是奸猾的曹丕，却深謀積慮，竭力破壞他的弟弟，終於使曹植失歡於曹操，而立他世做了子。所以當曹操未死之前，他已一躍而做到了副丞相。曹操出征時，他留守都城，權高一切，便連自己父親也不在眼裏了</p>
<p>不知是不是曹操洞悉了曹丕的別有政治陰謀，那次他從長安回來，回到洛陽後，忽然決意欲改立曹植為世子。因為恐怕自己的勢力不敵會丕，所以急召本來呌他留守長安的曹彰帶了大兵回來。關於這些，三國志和注裏都有文為證。『任城威王彰傳』云：</p>
<p>太祖東還，以彰行越騎將軍，留長安。太祖至洛陽，得疾，驛召彰。款至，祖崩。</p>
<p>注引『魏略」云：</p>
<p>彰至，謂臨　侯植曰：「光王我召者，欲立汝也太』植曰：「不可！不見袁氏兄弟乎？」</p>
<p>在這兩段文字裏，我們不但可以看　　丕果然有着別的政治陰謀，而且連　的突然得疾，曹操的突　死亡，也着實可以懷疑，他得疾後，何以不還至老家　城，（　為在那　，洞電台上有許多他的　　們可以服付他，）而要　在　　？立曹丕為世子已廿久了，何　　要在這個時　　立　來？　　改立就改立好了，何以必欲召回曹彰，至後改立？我們一思紫上列諸問題，便知道這時的曹操已處於曹丕的羅網之中，自由全失，只有召同帶兵的曹彰，才能保障自己的安全，而實行他廢立的大計。但是，可惜他知道得太晚了些，不但廢立的事不能實現，反而因此送掉了性命。我們可以再讀同書『太祖本紀』，云：</p>
<p>建安二十五年春正月，至洛陽·權擊斬關羽，　其首·庚子，王崩於洛陽·</p>
<p>在這篇本紀裏，上文始終未言操曾得疾，最後忽來一句『王崩於洛陽』，成為無疾而終，不是很可怪嗎？所以我以為作史的人一定有着『皮裏陽秋』。我們再讀『賈逵傳』注引『魏略』略云：</p>
<p>時太子（丕）在鄴，鄢陵侯（彰）未到，士民頗苦勞役，又有疾　，於是軍中騷動，　僚恐天下有變，顧不發喪。達建議為不可秘，乃發哀，令內外皆入臨。臨訖，各安敘不得動。</p>
<p>傳文則云：</p>
<p>時鄢陵侯彰行越騎將軍，從長安來赴，問逵先王豐嚴所在？達正色曰：『太子在鄴，國有儲副，先王興緩，非君侯所宜問也。』遂奉梓宮還鄴·文帝即王位，以鄴縣戶數萬在都下，多不法，乃以逵為鄴令。月餘，遷魏羣太守。大軍出征，復為丞相主簿祭酒。</p>
<p>從這兩段史文看，曹操由病至死，曹丕始終沒有到洛陽，而是由賈逵等護喪還鄴的。這時候他到底在那裏？而且在做些什麼事？這樣怎能使人對他沒有懷疑？所以我敢假定，曹操的得疾，恐非外來之疾，而死，却是不得其死。至於傳到現在的他的遣令，不是他生前早已立下，便是後來曹丕偽造的。曹操死後，曹丕繼任魏王，就在這一年的十月，就纂爭了漢朝的帝位，而這是曹操生前所不願做的。所以我的猜測是，大概曹操在外聽到了曹丕將有政治陰謀，所以急急回洛。或是回洛陽後才發現的。他想要消滅這個陰謀，只有實行廢立；要行廢立，那時曹丕已位居副丞相，非有武力不能對付，所以急召帶兵的曹彰回來帮助。不道消息外洩，曹丕索性一不做，二不休，把曹操也除去。而他自己却始終不露面，表面上沒有離鄴一步，以社絕人家的懷疑。而賈逵或者就是這個陰謀的奉行者，一所以功成之後，大得任用。這雖是我根據前引諸文的猜測之間，不曾經過詳密的考證，不過旁證還多·決非憑空的無稽之談可比。在曹操死後不久，據『資治通鑑』所載，曹丕便這樣的對待他的兄弟：</p>
<p>二月丁卯，葬武王於高陵，王弟鄢陵侯彰等皆就國。臨　監國謁者　均希指，奏臨菑侯植醉酒悖慢，勃脅使者。王（丕）貶植為守鄉侯，誅右刺姦　沛國丁儀，及弟董門侍郞　，並其男口，皆植之黨也。</p>
<p>如果不是曹操將死之前欲改立曹植，弟兄之間，何至懷怨而要這樣的對待？就是曹丕對待曹彰，『任城咸王彰傳』注引『魏略』云：</p>
<p>太子嗣立，旣葬，遣彰之國。始彰自以先王見任有功，冀因此遂見授用，而聞當隨例（謂隨諸使國就國），意甚不悅，不待遣而去。</p>
<p>這裏明明證彰如果不離都，也將受到嚴厲的處分，幸虧他見機走得快。到了黃初三年，忽然升他做任城王，他以為曹丕已不念舊事了，所以遂於『黃初四年，朝京都。』（本傳），但不料一到都，即『疾薨於邸』（本傳）。所謂『疾薨於邸』正同曹操的無疾而終是同樣可疑的事。本傳注引『魏氏春秋』也云：</p>
<p>初，彰問　綬，將有異志，故求朝不即得見，彰忿怒暴薨。</p>
<p>這裏所謂『異志』，明明是指奉父命回京那件事，所謂『忿怒暴薨』，當然是不得善終，從此可見曹丕之於曹　，較之對曹植尤為疾忌。因為他是帶兵的緣故。所以升他為任城王，乃是欲擒故縱，誘之入京，終乃置之於死地而後快。</p>
<p>曹操父子的不得其死，乃是彰明昭著的事實，不過幕後如何？主謀何人？究為何事？怎樣經過？那麼還要待高明的歷史專家去探討，去搜求，然後才能有所決定，我這兒所談的只是一篇文學題材的幾項歷史資料。</p>

<p>門前的菜園仍是　收的</p>
<p>南瓜如老人憇息在長蔓下</p>
<p>茄子肥腴得愛人</p>
<p>辣椒已由靑而紅熟了</p>
<p>整日與農作物相處</p>
<p>眼見秋天來而又去</p>

<p>在此未修葺的舊庭院裏</p>
<p>曾見滿園開花落</p>
<p>曾見蘆葦將白髮垂入水中</p>

<p>夫雜樹之欣欣向榮……</p>
<p>秋天一來羣山雜塵世更遠</p>
<p>萬物歸入沉睡的姿態</p>
<p>我怕看禾穗為秋風吹折腰枝</p>
<p>羣樹向我訴說春日的溫暖</p>
<p>從此羣山向我頂禮</p>
<p>無情的歲月刻不上容顏</p>

<p>我不了解為什麼緣故</p>
<p>千載的月色永遠緘默</p>

<h3>傘</h3>
<p>— ·羅英風·</p>
<p>一朶朵的傘飄過了雨天</p>
<p>像飾着圖案的一羣香躉——</p>
<p>在多雨的季節中旅行</p>
<p>在陰濕的泥土上生長</p>
<p>我撐開了我的小紙傘</p>
<p>在雨天裏我有一個小晴天</p>
<p>我昂着頭無畏忌的奔跑</p>
<p>我的脚步整齊而堅强</p>
<p>是雨天到晴天的橋樑</p>
<p>把我安渡到多陽光的彼岸</p>
<p>當雨水的殘滴淌盡了</p>
<p>便在我的　忘中歛藏</p>
<h3>火柴</h3>
<p>— 瑛</p>
<p>在冷冷的夜裏，</p>
<p>我劃了一枝火柴</p>
<p>看它開放着一朶</p>
<p>小小的橙紅花。</p>
<p>一朶小小的橙紅花，</p>
<p>閃出了片刻的光明，</p>
<p>輕微的溫暖，</p>
<p>說不盡的幻想的沉醉。</p>
<p>我想到童話裏那個</p>
<p>賣火柴的女孩，</p>
<p>她在這一朶小花裏，</p>
<p>找得了縹　的安慰。</p>
<p>一朵又一朶迅開迅謝，</p>
<p>像映着彩霞的海邊，</p>
<p>漸漸沉靜的泡沫，</p>
<p>留下無聲的黑暗。</p>
<h3>牧羊女</h3>
<p>— 賽剛梯尼</p>
<p>賽剛梯尼（Giovani　Segantini　1859-1899）是一個自小就失去父母的孤兒，十八歲還在為人牧羊饘猪，因天性愛畫，終于把多年的積蓄帶到米辣諾市投入了美術學校，學習了一點繪畫基礎之後，就回到自己的家鄕　——阿爾普斯高原繼續自修。</p>
<p>因為愛好自然，所作又多以現實生活為題，故無意中成了當時法蘭西印象主義運動的響應者。作風注重光，色彩燦爛，用筆細緻活潑，大有凌駕法國印象主義各作家之勢。惜「生不得志，歿後多年始為史家譽為意大利印象主義的先驅代表作有」「耕作」「牧羊女」等。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>還鄉</h3>
<p>— 蔣星煜</p>
<p>在這陰雨連綿的日子，旅途的寂寞本來就已夠我傷感夠我憂　；公路兩旁的白楊樹從前茂密得可以遮蔽天空，不讓陽光射進來，現在呢？只偶爾看見一株兩株稀疏地分佈着，那些茂密的白楊樹那裏云了！那綠色的濃蔭那裏去了！</p>
<p>當我回到這一個破殘的小城，發現一切都和各我相當陌生，而且親戚故舊竟也像公路上的白楊樹那樣稀少了，我才猛然想起，原來和這小城已經整整闊別了十一個年頭。</p>
<p>城裏儘是荒煙蔓草和廢墟，只有那些表彰貞女烈婦的石牌坊還存在着，雖然這是吃人的禮教的產物，雖然每座牌坊都有一個使人戰慄的故事，我却只能以它為唯一的標記，來辨識方向，來想像從前的市街。</p>
<p>我的舊居早已是一片平地，不知是誰在上面種了些南瓜，畢竟瓦礫裏沒有什麼肥料，南瓜的莖葉都瘦得可憐，就像一個先天不足的孩子，假使土地有知覺的話，它一定會像老家人那樣親切地和我談談離情，或是我童年時代少年時代的瑣事。我清晰地記憶起那平靜的井水一般的歲月，碧紗窗下，磨好一硯池松煙墨，寫顏真卿的「東方畫像贊」或是複雜，我沿着髦軟的泥土路走進公園，石櫈子上，男學生和女學生正低着頭在看書，準備即將舉行的學期考試，從他們身上，我找到了我自己的影子，找到了我失落已久底充滿了美麗的幻想的影子，而現在，我已經是一個有段枯木的人了。有一個學生把驚奇的眼光投向我，他也許以為我是一個飄泊者，一個偶然經過這小城的公園底異鄉人，假使他曉得我心裏正在想的是什麽，一定會笑的陳腐罷！</p>
<p>護城河汨汨地流着，有節奏地拍擊着兩旁的堤岸，一個漁夫在用巨大的綱捕魚，他留心着水面上每一個小小的氣泡和漩渦，當魚網提出水面的一霎那，他的表情是緊張的，你不用看網，只看他面上的表情是失望，淡漠或愉快，就知道他的成績了。為漁夫着想，自然希望他能多得到一些魚，為魚着想，則又希望它們都能逃出可怕的綱，這豈不也是一個矛盾麼？其實替魚担心也是多餘的，在人世間，看不見的綱正多着呢！譬如說煩惱的綱，名利的綱，情慾的綱，各色各樣的綱，自己不掉進來，或是掉進去了，知道馬上爬出來，就很難得的了。</p>
<p>在許多建築物毀壞了以後，這城市彷彿更加顯得寒傖，大家都選擇最近的路走，所以距離是縮短了，至於人與人之間的距離相形之下，不但沒有縮短，倒反更遠些，一個小城市就像一個小家庭、整天到晚所接觸的是有限的那幾個熟悉的面孔，照道理來說，應該是可以很和諧地生活的。然而我所看到是些什麼現象呢？柏斯格說：「人只是一支蘆葦，自然中最弱的東西」。現在我要說：假使蘆葦一定要互相碰擊，除了立刻同時折斷以外，不會出現別的奇蹟的。人們對於財富的狂熱，對於生活的過份刻苦，已經不是我所能了解，然而，這也是很好的，他們的心靈有了歸宿了，他們不會再感到生命的空虛，因為財富已經成為他們新的宗敎新的上帝。</p>
<p>在偏僻的地方，一個縣長的享受和權威，使我連想到古代的帝王，市民怕眼淚，我不是沒有看見，然而更可怕的，是在這種環境中長大的第二代，將來到社會上去，決不會知道什麼是廉潔，什麼是服務人羣。</p>
<p>當我臨走的前夜，月色好得出奇，是為我壯行色？還是為我祝福？何時，再回故鄉來欣賞月色呢？這是很難預卜的，在這動亂的時代。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　337</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>那份報告，却是小老虎的大手筆、託東北「寨子」駐平辦事處轉來：</p>
<p>「呈為報告事；敝人在天津「三不管」與隊長失散，谷自東西，尋到各處皆找他不到。敝人無法可使，三探日狗軍部，毫無下落。本與隊長，八月五日六日，應到張×口一帶，與寨子大隊四十多人會齊，莫非隊長找不到敝人，先行去也。敝人到平，無面參見總隊長大人，故草字數行，報告大人，雖赴湯滔（蹈）火，必要找到隊長也。部下蕭虎城立正報告。」</p>
<p>這份報告，並非密碼；因小老虎不懂密碼。妙在雖非密碼，却有密碼意味，不是个中人，簡直看不明白，我把這份報告，仔細審查一下，可以看得出小老虎為了　份報告，大槪費去不少心力。別看他文字不順眼，就這不順眼的妙文，小老虎未必寫得出來，這可以從兩點上看出：一，這報告並非小老虎親筆，字跡雖不佳，却比小老虎那「神仙一把抓」的未來派美術字，要規矩得十倍以上；一筆一劃，十二分恭正。第二點，這似牛非馬的呈文格式和報告的紙箋，並非普通信箋，又不是公文呈式用紙，乃是普通人打官事的狀子紙，另找一隻特大號紅簽官封，不知道從那一家康熙年代老古董紙店尋覓得來的。這，想必在可能的秘密範圍內，小老虎找到一位小半瓶醋的提刀人，兼臨事幕府老爺，露了這一手。</p>
<p>「又得老兄跑一趟了。」W君眼角帶着三分笑意、却是滿面憂容的對我說着。三分笑意，由於W君瞧着我在研究小老虎這封漯亮報告，猜透了我心下的推想各點。</p>
<p>「跑，毫無關係；單怕像天津這趟一樣，毫無成績—白跑。」我回想到丁君的慘死，其他同志的囚禁，竟不能盡半分心，效半分勞。「…目的地當然是萬全和張北；這邊一段，當然仍舊用『十五號』姿態；但渡過南口之後？……」我把出發的路綫，和路上的問題提明出來。</p>
<p>「是的！」W君轉動着那一雙智愁的眼睛；「這一段當然用『十五號』型出塲最合適；否則寸步難移……過了南口，又容易了，我很可以代老兄佈置妥當。問題的難點，在『怎樣渡過甫口』……」W君也似乎受了鶴見的傳染；把兩隻手負在身後，在屋子裏，往來雖　起來。</p>
<p>「南口的情形，到了什麽階段？」最近三四天我與時局情報脫了節，「〇四」雖然交給我一疊情報抄底、我還沒來得及細看。</p>
<p>絮語</p>
<h3>丁默邨的遺言</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>二十六號」巨奸丁默邨被槍決，臨終只說出一句話，他說：「希望政府對漢奸寬容一點」。丁逆沒有全部說出他的意見、就倒在血泊里了。這句話包含着多少意義，我們不知道，如若僅僅去濟測，那麼在敵偽時期曾經殺人如麻的丁默邨，對於他的判決死刑，似有「寃屈未伸」之意。</p>
<p>對於漢奸，上海人似乎比前一時看得淡泊得多，他們已不大關心他們是不是應受憲處，或是應該得到寬恕；但最少，在這紛　不安的心理狀態下，個人道德與品格的堤防，早已潰決，過去一切量衡是非黑白的準　，在這裏巳經變為無足輕重了。</p>
<p>而對於一個「觀　事仇」的漢奸，甚至一個歷歷可數的奸雄，大家似乎也並不斤斤計較他過去的罪狀了。</p>
<p>——這實在是一個非常可怕的傾向。</p>
<p>背叛民族利益，出賣祖國的人，然論如何，是應該得到懲處的。即是法律有一天予以寬恕，但以私人道德說，對於一個沒有氣節，沒有品格的人也應該予以適當的懲戒。</p>
<p>不然的話，歷史上不知多少變節辱國的「碩彥名士」，流傳至今，為什麽還要遭人家的笑駡？</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>一週七天命名的起源</h3>
<p>— 西風</p>
<p>為什麼星期日呌Sunday？還有其他七日侖名的意義呢？現在願作簡單的介紹：</p>
<p>日曜日Sunday：從字面猜想，你也會知道是太陽日的意思。太陽給人們光明，給人們溫暖，給人們活力，給人們幸福。古人從旱荒中領略到太陽之威力，在嚴寒時體會到太陽之溫存，寒暑晝夜之變，更感覺到太陽的神秘與奧妙，他們認為太陽是一個神，名呌愛普羅，他駕着輪子團着熊熊火熖的車，不停地在太空巡行。他們禦拜着太陽，其實沒有太陽就沒有世界，沒有一切，以太陽日來侖名一週的開始日，誰曰不宜？</p>
<p>月曜日Monday：本是Moonoday，顧名思義也可知道是「月之日」了金烏西沉，月兔東升，銀光瀉遍大地，萬物受着她的撫慰，均不無舒適，安暢，恬靜，和平之感。月神是一位纖弱，溫柔，文雅，美麗的女神，名呌黛雅娜，她乘着銀光閃爍的車子，追隨着愛普羅周遊八方。所以「月之日」也緊接着「太陽日」來命名每週的第二天了。</p>
<p>火曜日Tuesday：是「泰爾斯日」之意，泰爾斯是是山之神手下的一員英勇總戰的天神，山之神為了要征服狡滑的狠精芬里士，以及使甲貓的足音，女郞的髭鬚，山之峯，魚之嘯，熊之切望和鳥之唾沫，特地造了一條奇異的鏈索。泰爾斯就使用了這條鏈索，擒住了狼精芬里士，可是也因此喪失了一條臂膊。為了紀念他光榮的犧牲，因而命名每週第三日為「泰爾斯日」。在法文是日却呌Mardi，是耙念一員和泰爾斯相似的戰神斯，含義雷同馬</p>
<p>水曜日Wednesday：是紀念斯干的納維亞島上第一大神島登的日子。烏登住在到處鑲着珠寳金銀，煇煌艷麗的威爾哈拉宮中，肩頭老頂着兩匹烏雅，這是替他採訪下界新聞的「外勤記者」，並且常派她們去招請馬革裏屍暴骨疆塲的戰士，自已安閒地　着甜酒，聽取他們報告忠勇殉國，壯烈犧牲的經過。</p>
<p>木曜日Thursday：是「蘇爾」之日、蘇爾是斯干納維亞的强力神，他套着鐵手套，以一對誰也無力使用的重鎚作武器。有一天，巨人斯里本悄悄地偸了它去，那無恥的壞蛋聲言着要以女神菲萊亞下嫁為歸還重鎚的交換條件。蘇爾就喬裝了女神登門索取，宴席間他一口氣吃完了一頭壯牛和八條撒蒙魚，這可赫壞了斯里木，斯里木就在這時做了他的鎚下鬼了，蘇爾雖然這麽强有力，但有兩椿事仍是敬謝不敏的。他舉不起一匹小貓，一匹纏饒住整個地球的米德高達大蛇化身的貓。他喝不盡一角盃的水，這角盃的一端是連着大海的。木曜日是「强有力日」，這日的工作，會使你特別滿意。其實人在星期一，二，以為二星期的剛開始，散漫之心未收。而星期五，六，又以為星期日的將臨而致心神不安。只有這日心緒旣收未放，意志力量集中，自然可收事半功倍之效了。</p>
<p>金曜日Friday為「菲萊亞之日」。她就是使斯里木垂涎三尺的美麗的女神，丈夫烏登，兒子蘇爾，都有赫赫有名的。也許正因這夫貴子榮的緣故，她的芳名被侖名於每週的第六天了。不過西洋都討厭這不吉的日子，原因是為了這天是耶穌受難日。</p>
<p>木曜日Saturday是「沙丹之日」，紀念羅馬農神Sautuu，雖然他是一個恣情縱慾，粗魯野蠻的神，且還有過吞吃自己兒子的虐行，但却大有功於人類，人類是全賴着他的恩賜—五穀·蔬菜·瓜果·畜牧而生的。所以連土星也借他大名而呌Saturn了。而且到今日，無論是公務員·職工·學生·軍警·雅個不在延踵伸頸以望星期六日的到臨呢？</p>
<h3>釋「選舉」</h3>
<p>— 魯氏</p>
<p>「選舉」早已成了專門名詞一，普遍地被國人習用了，但是從嚴格說來，「選」與「舉」兩者的涵養　截然不同，茲分別加以詮釋。</p>
<p>「選」是由少數人從多數人中加以挑取的意思，例如尙書禮運篇「選賢與能」，「舉」是是由多數人公推少數人出來做事的意思，像漢霄「舉賢良方正」等是。</p>
<p>本來選舉方式有二，一種由全民（除消極限制外）投票，通常稱為普選。一種是由政府設定候選人，規定獲選人只能就候選人名單產生，一般稱為圈選，如此說來，普選這名詞，極應該修改為「普舉〕，而圈選那才是「選舉」，因為先選而後舉的。</p>
<p>但是現在我們並不主張在文字上為選舉正名，可是我們要提示人民，在舉之先，要愼重選擇我所要舉之人，才是眞正的民主精神，否則糢糢糊糊，聽人提弄，形成舉而不選，那種選舉是從然的啊！</p>
<h3>整飭日本整肅工作</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>日本政府於六月廿七日，宣佈了關於最後政治整肅的詳細辦法。其中包括言論報導方面和統制言論機關。可是，可注意的是：過去列人受檢名單被檢舉的英文日本時報，此次竟不在整肅之列。前些時已盛傳日外相蘆田將因在該社担任社長及主筆，而有整肅可能，因該報受外交部津貼且時常刋載軍閥言論之故。現在竟不在整肅之列，所以很引起日本報界的警異。其實在整肅工作下，得寵的不僅是蘆田故日本時報而已，我們來同顧一下過去的整肅，即可瞭然於懷了。</p>
<p>原來在日本，除了重要戰犯由遠東國際軍事法庭審訊外，盟軍總部為了要使日本能在一個新的途徑上走向民主化，先必須淸算社會中堅層的腐化份子，所以曾下了關於執行肅淸擁護侵略份子的命令，命日政府組織中央整肅委員會來辦理日本政治、敎育，經濟及企業中黷武份子與成問題人物的整肅。</p>
<p>在日本企業及經濟，金機構方面，十大財閥和那些金融寡頭都失去了他們的控制能力，有一百萬日元以上資產的公司都被淸算，各重要官員職員均被肅淸，且被禁止再入被整肅及公司服務。</p>
<p>在敎育方面，成問題的敎職員，都被驅逐出學校。那些發表講武思想的敎授、都要使其離開講座。</p>
<p>在政治方面，被整肅及的有　員，議員，又在一九四五年九月二日前任各地方城鎭領袖，且在政，經及宣傳方面曾任要職的，今後皆不准出任官職。</p>
<p>初親上面所述整肅工作，似予大可滿意的，但是實際上並不如此。在中央整肅委員　的委員自身，就有許多有被整肅的嫌疑。幣原內閣時，就一直以拖延的方法，以財政經濟及糧食恐慌和社會危機，及調查戰時活動情形來應付盟軍總部的催促。還指使各政，軍，財及金融機關改頭換面或化整為零。在那拖延的時期中，秘密警察及一些不知名的　武份子，已被安插做地方上被整肅者的後繼者。大財　也許多分散或改組。有一批御用敎授，還高踞在講壇上。閣員則不麒一時更動者，列入待檢之列，以示姑息。官吏則皆以過　次要職者升任。據美國通訊員報告，前首相吉田不但不積極阻止不可信任的政治家參政。且鼓勵他們在幕後工作。</p>
<p>現在日本國內的整肅工作，已近結束，可是過去的整肅，實在不能滿意。而在政治方面開始最後的整肅中，又　縱了一　譽做侵略政府對外的傳　筒的日本時報社。當此時候，我們實在要求對整肅工作作一次全面檢討，請對日管制委員會和盟軍總部來整飭和檢查整肅工作的內容，使能澈底達成整肅的目的。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐</p>
<p>軍艦旣是海面的怪物，似乎在沿海船搗裏造艦方屬正道，如果不是我親眼看見，而說是美國軍艦在山頂上修造，一定被人斥為！稽，那眞寃哉枉也·美國軍艦確實是在山頂造的，在平時　准軍艦原在東西岸船塢修造，但自第二次世界大戰爆發，　岸深受敵方威脅，不特船塢有被炸燬可能，即工人亦無心服務，因此把造艦設備完全　進洛磯山中·</p>
<p>洛磯山在美匯中部還西，以哥羅拉多省為主峯，高出海平凡一英里，所以哥羅拉多省的省城「丹佛」Deenver有一別名，呌做City　of　one　Mile　High，你如果問哥羅拉多來的扶輪社社員，一定知道而且贊賞這個別名，我住在丹佛時，曾由當地「中國之友肚」招待入山參觀造船廠，造船廠設在山中，可算是曠古未有之奇聞，從未我們廳到中國在洞庭湖裏建設海軍，已覺得不怎樣名副其實，因為湖裏面討生涯的向來不構做「軍」，在洛磯山裏面討　的却是眞正的海軍。我們從丹佛坐汽車出發，汽車開了足有二小　才到了造船廠，我們雖看不到整艘的船，但在　造的却是軍艦的各部分，也有像小洋房那們大的部分，迨好了由汽車　到鐵進綫、裝上火車，運往西岸，　西雅　，　金山，洛杉　等，化上個把星期就把幾萬件　零狗碎的零件，裝成幾萬噸載重的軍艦了。</p>
<p>去山中參觀造船廠的中國人不止我一個，當時因為太平洋戰事正酣，所以報上沒有隻字提及。中國的沿海並不是沒有威脅的，我們如果眞的要建設海軍，應該在貴州或西康的山中去建設幾所造船廠，免得沿海一旦受到空監威脅，逃難還來不及，那里還會好整以暇的去造船呢？（十三）</p>
<h3>人類的一個遠房親戚</h3>
<p>— 常曙</p>
<p>進化論上，整個動物界是一個大家庭。以人類作一個體來說，則猿猴之類，正是人類的遠房兄弟，血統相同。所以當你到動物園看見矮小的猴子跳來跳去，周身黃毛，還拖着一根尾巴，或許以為醜怪難看了。不敢認為同類，但這不是別人，正是你的遠房表親，當你還在娘胎第六個月時，不特和牠同一個樣子，且還和牠經過短期間同樣的生活。</p>
<p>非洲有一種大猴，生有金黃色的美　，一個長大銀硃鼻的兩旁，配着明亮綠色的有溝紋的面龐。牠是狒狒族中最奇特美觀的份子，也是一個最漂亮的動物。這種大猴愛好同羣生活，假使走散了，不惜跋躡長途，尋覓同類的所在。</p>
<p>芝加哥的野川動物園中，有一碩大的雄性大猴，或稱為排排，牠會習慣地用飲水的杯子敲打地板，以博取同類的贊賞。</p>
<p>華盛頓國立動物園中，有一個年輕的大猴，聰明伶俐像牠面　上美麗的顏色一樣。會做出各滑稽的舉動、撩人歡喜。他伸開雙手躺在一條木楊上，將一條草在手上遞來遞去。觀眾立在牠的面前，會舞弄棍子引人注意。倘以什物擲擊扡，他會一一接着。牠能折斷木棍，撑傘在籠內表演各種姿勢，模倣人的樣子，常歷一小時而不厭倦。</p>
<p>除了這些遨玩方式外，無論在被囚以後的敎養如何，還保存着在非洲時的兇暴性。牠具有仇視敵人的脾氣，堅强的牙齒，銳利的指甲。西部非洲土人，很懼怕這種大猴的成羣侵襲，說到這些動物，也懷着幾分恐懼心情。面具製造師要模倣大猴的樣子，來製造恐怖面具，就為了這理由</p>
<h3>琵琶記索隱</h3>
<p>— 孝</p>
<p>元曲盛行於今者，當推琵琶西廂二記，而西廂詞曲，尤膾炙人口。蓋其內容，類多才子佳人故事，自易取悅於靑年也，惟琵琶記則不然，全書所載，大多忠臣孝子，烈女義夫之瑣事，老成人讀之，或以其有關世道，而不忍棄置，少年人讀之，恐耳鳴目眩，昏然思睡矣。然就其詞曲而論，較西廂似猶過之，第讀書人之意多不在此耳。按明何元朗曲論所載；高則誠作此記時，意有別指，時有王四者，與高友善，勸之仕，登第，即棄其妻而　於不花太師家，則誠深惡之，因作琵琶記諷誎，名曰琵琶者，取其頭上四王，為王四之隱語，元人呼牛為「不花」，書中牛丞相，即不花太師也。至以蔡伯喈之大賢，借為書中主角者，　係由　游詩致之，游有竹枝祠日：「斜陽　敲趙家莊，　板先生正作場，身後是非　　　，滿村　　　中郞」。其後，明大　滅元，得　　記而愛之，因問則誠　書之旨，危棄以　　，太　大怒，　　王四於　荒，古人一字之　，　於斧　於　　記得之。</p>
<h3>念梅克湼先生</h3>
<p>— 愧生</p>
<p>報載：「紐約廿四日廣播，支加哥大學遠東歷史學敎授梅克湼，患心臟病逝世，事年五十五歲」。按梅氏為政治學兼歷史學專家，原名H.McNair，出身加利福尼亞大學，為美國政治學權咸Prof.Sait入室弟子。梅氏中文譯名，應為宓亨利（其白譯者），任敎約大，歷十餘年，為作者業師。宓氏與雷默氏Prof.Remer同為約大政治經濟系名敎授，為學頗勤。至其治學方針，在以歷史的貫串方式，研究政治，對於國際及遠東問題，尤富心得，蓋與新會梁啓超氏同轍。氏擅口才，吐屬雋雅，上下數千年，　繼如貫珠。積學之瞻，求之國內學者，甚少其　。其治學方法，注重原始研究Origina　Research、善用索引法Index　Method、轉少課本類具體著述。憶在約大時，漏夜著書，焚膏忘倦，談鋒一觸，口若懸河。奉母以居，承歡菽水，其至行頗富東方色彩。言念師門，彷彿如昨，令人興梁木之感。</p>
<h3>宗教與道德</h3>
<p>— 小童</p>
<p>W·倍洛說：「宗敎是私德和公信之基礎，也是個人快樂和國家興盛的募礎。」G·斯比林又說：「沒有一種道德是沒有宗敎的。」世界各國似乎都有宗敎的　在，冬數的社會是在宗敎的氣氛中演進着，人類的道德也就在這種的環境下改化；自古至今的宗敎派別很多，最普遍的有基督敎，天主敎，回敎和佛敎等，敎義也各有異。佛敎以慈悲為　，回敎以修身為重、天主敎以虔誠為聖，基督敎則廣施博愛、但是，眞正的宗敎是祇有一種，正像個人的信仰一樣，不能是多方面的，眞正的宗敎，就是和正義相符合的宗敎、是沒有甚麼東西能和它敵對的。人類為了各有其不同的宗敎信仰，也甚至於一部分人是沒有宗敎信仰的，所以，人與人之間就缺少了一種發揚私德的共同的宗敎信仰，沒有了靈魂上公信的連繫，由於此點，在各種信仰不同的人們之間，就有了一種很深的隔膜，難免產生出互相妬妒，猜疑，傾軋，損害等種糧有傷道德的情形來；這樣的長此以往，個人的這德怎不落後？在缺乏私德的人心裏，怎能培養出快樂的心境來？在人民的信仰不一。道德低落的國家，又怎會與盛呢？</p>
<p>且看托爾斯泰所說的一句話：</p>
<p>「優良的人民是國家興盛的要素，宗敎的信仰則是養成人民有美好德性的唯一要素。」</p>

<h3>General Mobilization Order Implementation Methods Submitted to Political Affairs Conference for Discussion; All Surplus Military Officers Nationwide to be Retained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Following the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, detailed rules for its implementation and other related issues have been under discussion by the Executive Yuan, which has convened meetings of relevant ministry and commission heads for several days. The meeting at 3 PM on the 7th was presided over by Wang Yunwu. Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Gan Naiguang, Qin Dechun (representing the Ministry of National Defense), and Zhao Longwen (representing the Ministry of Food) all attended. The main topic of discussion was the amount of grain to be requisitioned. It was decided that the total amount of grain and currency to be requisitioned from October of this year to September of next year would be 60 million dan. This decision will be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for discussion on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] According to a Military News Agency report: To coordinate with the General Mobilization for Bandit Suppression, military authorities have specifically stipulated that all existing surplus military officers nationwide, regardless of general, field grade, or company grade rank, will be retained, except for those who are qualified for retirement (separation) or who voluntarily retire. It is reported that the Central Training Corps, after receiving the order, will first select 180 outstanding surplus field grade officers and assign them to units for duty. The remaining retained personnel will also be processed by the end of the month.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Xu Siping, Director of the Conscription Bureau, stated on the 7th: After the General Mobilization Order is promulgated, the responsibilities of provincial and county officials in handling conscription affairs will be temporarily increased, and the need for assistance from various parties will also increase; this is to be expected. At the same time, the current situation is no longer comparable to peacetime, and conscription affairs cannot be handled as leisurely as in peacetime. In the handling of conscription, some speed must be sought. As for whether the source of soldiers will increase and whether procedures will change, this will depend on instructions. When asked by reporters whether defense industry workers and others would still be eligible for postponement of conscription, Xu replied: Defense workers are still eligible for postponement of conscription. In addition, the regulations regarding postponement of conscription for only sons, elementary school teachers, and students above the high school level will not change. China has abundant manpower, and those handling conscription hope not to disturb the people too much. When reporters inquired about the recruitment of soldiers in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, Xu replied: Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places have many students, workers, and public school personnel, all of whom are eligible for postponement of conscription. This increases the difficulty of conscription. However, on the other hand, there are also many unemployed and out-of-school people, and there is no shortage of those who are willing to serve the country. Mayors Wu and Shen once requested instructions from the Chairman on this matter. President Zhang, based on the provisions of Article 32 of the Conscription Law, stipulated that "Those who voluntarily serve in the military shall have their service determined by order." Therefore, recruitment is not inconsistent with the law. The only questions are whether the number is sufficient and whether the quality meets the requirements. At the same time, recruitment does not mean that the old mercenary system will be restored. Even if recruitment is sufficient to fill the quota, conscription work will still proceed as usual.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] It is rumored that postal and telecommunications censorship will be restored after the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order.

The Ministry of Communications stated that in some areas, such as the Northeast, which are close to the front lines, postal and telecommunications censorship has not been lifted. Furthermore, news censorship may not be restored after the general mobilization. If necessary, it is feared that it will be limited to military matters only.</p>

<h3>President Chiang Encouraged Party Members; Completing the Mission of National Construction with Hard Work and without Complaint Chen Cheng Reported on the Results of One Year of Bandit Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng made a military report at the Central Party Headquarters' Memorial Week at 9 AM on the 7th. He pointed out: Two years since victory, due to the Chinese Communists' rebellion, plotting to subvert the government, and betray the country, they have even harmed the people, causing a second serious national crisis, so that none of our plans for demobilization, reorganization of the army, and peaceful construction have escaped their destruction. Finally, they opposed the National Assembly and the Constitution. In order to save the people, the government had no choice but to resort to military suppression. Regarding the military situation of the bandit suppression, Chen first explained the situation of the Communist bandits. The Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Yeh Jianying bandit troops numbered about 200,000. The Southern Hebei Liu Bocheng bandit troops numbered about 100,000. The Southern Shanxi Chen Geng bandit troops numbered about 40,000. The Northern Hebei Nie Rongzhen bandit troops numbered about 90,000. The Northern Shanxi He Long bandit troops numbered about 30,000. The Northern Shaanxi Peng Dehuai bandit troops numbered about 40,000. Those unifiedly commanded by Lin Biao outside the pass totaled about 300,000. In total, there are 970,000 rebellious bandits inside and outside the pass (including militiamen). Chen then recounted the course of the war, detailing the battles in the Northeast and North China regions. Finally, he summarized the results of one year of bandit suppression, divided into the following points: (1) Recovering northern Jiangsu, making it difficult for the bandits to continue their food supply. (2) Destroying the military supply factories built by the Japanese army along the Ping-Sui Railway line, cutting off the bandits' replenishment. (3) Seizing the bandits' political center, Yan'an, and undermining their morale. (4) Ensuring the results of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Although the Communist bandits colluded with foreign forces, attempting to reap the benefits, the National Army completely defeated Lin Biao's main force in the battle of Sipingjie last year, and recently inflicted a serious blow on the bandits in Sipingjie again. Regarding the unrecovered areas in the Northeast, it is hoped that the entire region will continue to be recovered. (5) Recovered 212 counties in one year, seizing 710,913 various guns and cannons. (6) Approximately 1,642,333 rounds of various ammunition were captured, and 94,381 bandit soldiers were captured, and 145,285 bandit soldiers surrendered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 7th Dispatch] The National Revolutionary Army Oath-Taking Commemoration Meeting and the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters' Founder's Memorial Week were held jointly in the auditorium of the headquarters at 9 AM on the 7th. After President Chiang led the salute, Committee Member Chen Cheng reported on military affairs. Chen said that today is also the tenth anniversary of the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident. Recalling the victory achieved by the hard-fought eight-year Anti-Japanese War by the entire nation, he was filled with indignation that the goal of demobilization and national construction could not be achieved due to the disaster brought to the country and the people by the Communist bandits. Then, he reported in detail on the recent military situation, the process of suppressing bandits, and the achievements of bandit suppression in the past year. In the end, Chen made a firm statement, saying: All officers and soldiers in the country will definitely implement the government's order to suppress bandits, and must have the greatest determination to be the vanguard of suppressing the rebellion, and hope that the compatriots across the country will cooperate in the spirit of sharing weal and woe, so as to quell the bandit rebellion as soon as possible. After Chen's report, President Chiang also made an important speech, briefly stating: The government has now issued a national general mobilization order, the meaning of which is to strengthen the bandit suppression force, and at the same time strengthen the construction work. The most important of the construction work is to implement the Principle of Democracy and promote democracy in accordance with the established national construction procedures. On the other hand, it is the reform of internal affairs. At this critical moment of national difficulty, party members of our party should display the revolutionary spirit, work hard and without complaint, overcome all revolutionary obstacles, and complete the mission of suppressing bandits and building the country.</p>
<h3>Vice-President Sun Spoke About the Current Situation; Implementing General Mobilization Could Shorten the Time of Internal Chaos; The Proportional Representation Requested by the Two Parties is Still Under Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After Vice President Sun arrived in Shanghai, he responded to reporters' questions on the current situation, which are recorded as follows: (1) The proportional election requested by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party is a problem that needs to be solved, and is currently still under negotiation with the Soviet Union. Outer Mongolia is in fact a vassal state of the Soviet Union and has not established diplomatic relations with our country, so all negotiations must be conducted through Moscow. As for the rumor that Soviet troops have occupied Tacheng, I have not heard of it when I was in Beijing. (3) The relationship between China and the Soviet Union is currently not good. This is because the Soviet side has failed to abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty and has not returned Lushun and Dalian. As for the Soviet Union's recent withdrawal of overseas Chinese in China, it is due to the lack of manpower in the country, and it has no major relationship with the diplomatic relations between the two countries. (4) When asked whether the government's issuance of a mobilization order could shorten the time of internal chaos, Sun said: The government is concentrating all its efforts to quell the rebellion, and the period can be shortened, but only God knows when the internal chaos will end. Also, "After the mobilization order is issued, political parties can no longer oppose the civil war, otherwise they will be opposing the government and must be resolutely dealt with. You may pass this message on to the Democratic League." Sun denied the rumor that he would go to Guangdong.</p>

On the shipping industry's side, we hope even more that those in charge and personnel in various departments will demonstrate a high degree of patriotism and love for the nation, remember the difficult times, understand the government, and cooperate. It must be understood that during the period of national military suppression of the rebellion, weapons and ammunition are more important than clothing. These forces must be replenished quickly and reliably in order to bring the rebellion to an end as soon as possible, restore the country to unity as soon as possible, and allow the people to live in peace. The most efficient transport method is also the most dangerous, requiring the most [illegible] and time. Therefore, during the period of general mobilization, the shipping industry's task is actually as important as that of the military. Subsequently, regarding [illegible] aspects, the following were suggested: (1) [illegible] integration and reorganization; (2) developing [illegible] lines; (3) proper equipment and efforts to progress; (4) building [illegible].</p>
<p>Yang Changbei Raises Matters Requiring Attention</p>
<p>Then, Yang Changbei, a representative of the shipping industry, delivered a speech, stating briefly: In the past, our country did not pay attention to the improvement of shipping policies. The convocation of this conference today is fortunate for the shipping industry as it allows for research and discussion of shipping policies. However, we believe that the establishment of shipping policies requires attention to issues such as the increase in tonnage and the shipping policy itself. Increasing tonnage can expand foreign trade and earn foreign exchange, which will help the financial situation. Shipping administration has protection, which will also help the financial situation. Shipping administration has protection, and the shipping industry can comply with it. The second is the protection and development of shipping rights. We should be determined to protect our shipping rights and not allow foreign ships to intrude. Other issues related to the shipping industry, such as fuel, loans, route allocation, insurance, and safety, all await discussion at the review meeting. The speech ended with a salute.</p>
<p>The First Review Meeting Discusses Navigation Administration</p>

Representatives spoke freely until about 6:00 p.m. The review meeting will continue on the 8th, and a review committee will meet in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>More Than 70% of Overseas Chinese in Nanyang Have Returned; More Than 30,000 Remain in the Country</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Liu Weichi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, told reporters yesterday: The work of repatriating overseas Chinese has been largely completed, and we will now focus on developing overseas Chinese affairs. Of the millions of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, more than 100,000 fled back to China during the Pacific War. To date, more than 70% have returned. Because local governments only allow overseas Chinese to return to their hometowns in batches, more than 30,000 people currently remain in various parts of the country. The future development of overseas Chinese affairs will focus on the restoration of overseas Chinese economic activities in various places. In terms of immigration, the immigration restrictions in the United States have been improved, and an agreement may soon be established with Canada. The Philippines has very strict restrictions on overseas Chinese immigration and commercial activities in the area. In Siam, the number of people allowed to enter the country each year is limited to 12,000. In Annam, the situation is special due to the war. Indonesia has always been very hostile to overseas Chinese, and the trend has recently intensified. This is worth noting.</p>

After receiving the Guangdong disaster report, the Executive Yuan immediately sent Director Huo of the Executive Relief Administration to inspect and issued 1,000 tons of rice and 500 million in relief funds to handle emergency relief. However, due to the wide area of the disaster, reaching 60 counties, and the 5 million affected people, a joint meeting was held to discuss measures, and the following was decided: (1) Send senior officials to handle the disaster relief matters jointly with the provincial government and Director Huo of the Executive Relief Administration. (2) The Executive Yuan will allocate 30 billion yuan for relief. (3) It has been found that there is still a large amount of rice available in Guangdong Province, and the United Relief Administration will be consulted again to agree to allocate it for emergency relief and water conservancy projects. At the same time, relevant agencies will be strictly ordered to strengthen assistance in transporting grain, rescuing refugees, and carrying out health work. In Guangxi, the disaster area covers more than 50 counties, with 12 counties being particularly severe and 1.5 million people affected.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Urgent Repair of the Yellow River Levee</h3>
<p>With the Yellow River's major flood season approaching and the threat of flooding imminent, the UNRRA office in China has suggested that our government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) both cease all military operations within five miles of the entire Yellow River riverbed and levee, so that re-embankment work can be completed before the end of July to prevent the disaster of a major flood. Our government fully accepted UNRRA's suggestion and sent personnel to form a joint committee with UNRRA and the CCP to accomplish this task. Unexpectedly, the CCP's Liu Bocheng's troops took the opportunity to forcibly cross the Yellow River at Dongkou, harassing the south bank and obstructing the re-embankment of the Yellow River, causing the dikes in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong to be in imminent danger of breaching, and the situation is extremely serious. For the sake of the lives and property of the people in this vast area, we must not miss the opportunity to prevent disaster, and we would like to make an appeal to all parties to urgently repair the Yellow River levee.</p>
<p>The Yellow River levee has not been repaired for nine years. After the closure of Huayuankou was completed on March 15 this year, the Yellow River was re-diverted to its original course. However, the repair and defense work along both banks of the river is more difficult than blocking the breach. If repairs are not made before the flood season, a breach in the levee would unfortunately repeat the disaster of the Huayuankou flood, and the lives and property of the people would be unimaginable. The Yellow River has four flood seasons each year, and the major flood on July 1st marks the beginning of the dangerous peach flood season. This year, due to the chaos of war, there are many problems with urgent repairs and defenses. After the Ministry of Water Resources was established, it instructed the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to supervise the three defense offices of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan to recruit workers and collect materials, and to rush repairs day and night. On June 21, representatives from the government, UNRRA, and the CCP held a meeting in Heze and reached an agreement stipulating that July 15 would be the deadline for the completion of the initial project. At the same time, the UNRRA office in China also proposed a ceasefire between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and stepped up re-embankment, and advocated that residents of the Yellow River Delta should be evacuated immediately to avoid repeating the disasters caused by floods before the war. The proposal further expressed UNRRA's willingness to cooperate with the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to mobilize manpower and materials at any time to assist in mediation, in order to promote work and supervise projects, and save the catastrophe. UNRRA's spirit of service and clear vision deserve admiration!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the CCP lacks rationality and disregards conscience, and does not value matters that are closely related to the vast majority of the people. Before the ink on the Heze agreement was dry, the Communist troops on the north bank began firing, and recently Liu Bocheng's troops on the border between Henan and Shandong, disregarding the people's suffering, secretly sent a large army to cross the river to harass them. This shows that the Heze agreement was a pretense for negotiation by the CCP, and its real intention was to take advantage of the National Army's unpreparedness and the tension of the re-embankment work to launch a surprise attack to the south. Its treachery is the same as Li Zicheng's digging up the Heigangkou of the Yellow River at the end of the Ming Dynasty, but in terms of action, Liu Bocheng is even more lacking in rationality and conscience than Li Zicheng. Presumably, those who sympathize with the CCP, witnessing this situation, must have a new understanding of the CCP and recognize that they are unreliable.</p>
<p>The urgent repair and defense of the Yellow River re-embankment is a constructive undertaking, a peaceful project, and needs to be carried out under the premise of peace and tranquility. Now, the Yellow River levee, from Kuhe in Guangwu, Henan, to the sea entrance in Lijin, Shandong, is 1,200 li long. Including the section near Jinan on the south bank, the government controls one-half, and the north bank, except for Chenqiao and above, is almost entirely occupied by the Communist army. If the CCP is unwilling to cooperate with the government and UNRRA in a peaceful situation to carry out the re-embankment project, the government and UNRRA have little power to reverse the situation to carry out peaceful urgent repairs and defenses. After the major flood strikes, they can only sit and watch their usual efforts fall short. UNRRA officials are well aware of the political situation in our country, so they urgently suggested that both sides cease fire along the river. The Ministry of Water Resources understands this situation, so it has made many efforts to win the cooperation of the CCP and established the Heze Agreement. Unfortunately, Liu Bocheng's "surprise attack" completely shattered it. He launched a surprise attack on the lives and property of tens of millions of people. He is "struggling" and "liquidating" with the people. If this blind action is not stopped, the major flood will arrive in a blink of an eye, and the disaster will be unimaginable. Therefore, we would like to state the following propositions:</p>
<p>(1) We hope that the CCP will restore rationality, abide by the promise of the Heze Agreement signed in mid-June, accept UNRRA's suggestion to immediately cease military operations within five miles of the levee, withdraw the blind troops, and cooperate with the government and UNRRA to quickly complete the Yellow River re-embankment project in July.</p>
<p>(2) We hope that UNRRA will mobilize manpower and materials to assist water conservancy engineering agencies, distinguish between urgency and adapt to the situation of peace and tranquility, and complete the levee work at each mouth section by section. If the CCP refuses UNRRA's suggestions with actions, UNRRA should, from a position of upholding justice, stop all material assistance to the CCP as a warning to those who violate justice. If UNRRA does not punish them, the CCP will disregard any international cooperation in the future.</p>
<p>(3) We hope that the National Army will take swift action to eliminate and prevent Liu Bocheng from fleeing south, ensure the safety of the dangerous works at Dongkou, and be more vigilant against the Communist army destroying any dangerous works on the levee during the major flood period; otherwise, the flood will overflow and the lives and property of the people will be wiped out, and the people of the three provinces will not be able to withstand this catastrophe again. The Communist army does not want the people, and the National Army needs to win the people over.</p>
<p>In short, the Yellow River flood is approaching a dangerous juncture, and urgent repairs and defenses are imminent: we must not sit back and wait for the peach flood to strike because the CCP has violated the agreement. The sun and moon move in tandem, and rivers never cease; the ancients have said it: we hope that the government will overcome all difficulties and relieve the people from their distress. At the same time, we call on enlightened people to use the power of public opinion and the voice of justice to force the Communist army to stop military operations, so that the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River can face this dangerous juncture and avoid an unprecedented catastrophe!</p>
<h3>May I Ask the London Times</h3>
<p>The London Times, generally regarded as the mouthpiece of the British ruling class, has recently put on colored glasses and commented on the situation in our country since the implementation of the national mobilization, believing that the only way to save China from suffering is to quickly organize a truly united government. We do not understand what the current government of China is if not a united government? The Kuomintang is no longer a one-party dictatorship, and the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, which are in the opposition, have now joined the government? China now has a "National Government" composed of multiple parties, which is actually a united government; we cannot say that we still need to quickly organize a truly united government because the Communist Party has not participated. If this is not a lack of understanding of the current situation in China, it is because it has been poisoned by the CCP's malicious propaganda. May I ask, the United Kingdom also has a Communist Party, but have they ever participated in the "National Government" led by Churchill during the war; but was Churchill's "National Government" not a united government?</p>
<p>There are many talented people in the United Kingdom, but the British are also most likely to be unknowingly poisoned by the CCP's propaganda. I recall that when the current British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel, took office in the United States, he also said that the Chinese Communist Party was not a true Communist Party, but only a rural reformer. This is the propaganda that the CCP hopes foreigners will recognize them as, and the British Ambassador became their mouthpiece. We lament the talents of the British. Today, the London Times's argument is similar, and it also coincides with the CCP's propaganda to some extent. We do not believe that a qualified newspaper like the London Times would also be a mouthpiece for the CCP. Otherwise, why...?</p>

<h3>After the Soviet Union Rejected the Marshall Plan, the United States Strengthened its Determination to Aid Europe, Possibly Adopting a Wartime Lend-Lease Approach; France has Exerted Every Effort to Achieve Understanding with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] The Washington correspondent of the "Sunday Times" recently reported that the United States may adopt a wartime lend-lease approach to aid other countries, controlled by "a new supreme authority." The attitude adopted by the Soviet representative at the Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference has strengthened the United States' active assistance to European countries that support the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Chalon-sur-Saône, 6th] French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a speech here tonight stating that France has exerted every effort to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union. Although we do not recognize this division as a definite division, France's position is clearly different. France will move forward together with countries that are willing to rebuild Europe in peace. Secretary of State Marshall's proposal for European recovery is extremely commendable. In order to make American aid a reality, France has an extremely important position in Europe. I hope that the Popular Republican Movement can support my efforts.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The French diplomatic community is worried about the possibility of European countries splitting into two opposing camps regarding Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan, but it is said that the door to cooperation is still open, and it is hoped that the Soviet Union will participate. It is said that Europe has been divided for hundreds of years, and the Marshall Plan actually provides Europe with an opportunity for coordination. Relying on this, Prime Minister Ramadier declared at a Socialist Party meeting that the Marshall Plan is "the only way to organize the European economy. We must jointly assume the leadership responsibility with the United Kingdom to engage in European recovery."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Manchester, 6th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton stated in his speech today that the United States government is willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, but it cannot wait too long. If the Soviet Union cannot participate immediately, then the United Kingdom and other European countries will not wait for the Soviet Union, but will cooperate to carry out their European economic recovery plan. The United Kingdom hopes that the Soviet Union will still participate in this plan in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 7th] Within the British Labour Party and Conservative Party, opinions on Bevin's policy on the Marshall Plan are gradually diverging. Left-wing member Mikardo delivered a speech saying, "Bevin knows that the United States will never allow the Soviet Union to profit in any dollar zone. It is a pity that Bevin did not stand up and speak out in Paris. How can we first invite someone like Molotov to attend the meeting, and then 'denigrate' him for policy differences?"</p>
<h3>Czech Republic Expresses Willingness to Accept Invitations from Britain and France to Participate in European Conference, But with the Precondition of Obtaining More Reports</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 6th] The "London Daily Telegraph" quoted a broadcast from the Czech capital Prague today stating that regarding the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the all-European economic conference in Paris on the 12th to discuss Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European recovery, the Czech government has expressed provisional acceptance, but on the condition of "obtaining more reports on the Marshall Plan and its implementation methods."</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 7th Radio: Czech authorities said that the Czech Cabinet held a meeting on the morning of the 7th to discuss whether the Czech Republic should accept the invitations from Britain and France to participate in the American aid to Europe plan conference. Also, Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk will go to Moscow on Monday or Tuesday to attend a meeting. According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the commercial delegation to the Soviet Union to negotiate a new commercial treaty departed on the 6th, but the Minister could not attend due to illness.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] People here expect that the visit to Moscow by senior Czech government officials this week will determine whether any Eastern European countries will participate in the 24-nation European economic conference. Of the 22 countries invited by Britain and France, it is now known that Finland has refused to attend, and Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Romania are expected to follow in Finland's footsteps. Among the other invited countries, 14 have already affirmed their acceptance of the invitation or expressed their willingness to accept. The Czech Ambassador to Paris said tonight that Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk are scheduled to leave for Moscow on Tuesday. He stated that the Czech government has not yet decided whether to accept the invitations from Britain and France. French officials here are eagerly hoping that the Czech Republic and other Eastern European countries can participate in the Paris conference on the 12th of this month and actively participate in the recovery plan for Europe. If so, then the Soviet Union's subsequent joining would not be impossible.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Moscow from this agency, Moscow believes that Eastern European countries are unlikely to participate in the Paris conference, and the Soviet Union is still actively pursuing a policy of economic self-sufficiency. Today's Zhenli Bao's special commentary once again accused the Marshall Plan of expanding the Truman Doctrine, intending to organize Western European countries against the United States. The article also pointed out that the suggestions of Britain and France are a threat. The path taken by Britain and France is contrary to international cooperation and the interests of the European people. The Paris Observer further predicted that after the Czech-Soviet negotiations, the great powers may take the following three actions: (1) Czech Prime Minister Gottwald will decide that the Czech Republic will not participate in the Paris conference, in which case Poland and other Slavic countries will also take the same route. (2) Gottwald may be encouraged by the Soviet Union to participate in the Paris conference together with other Eastern European countries, adopting a delaying and obstructing policy to prevent the implementation of the Marshall Plan. (3) Gottwald may be able to strongly argue to the Soviet Union that the Czech Republic must participate in the discussion of American aid in order to see what happens, so that Eastern European countries will not be accused of destroying the recovery plan for Europe.</p>
<h3>Lie Arrives in London; Optimistic about European Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie arrived in London today after returning from the United States to Norway for a one-month vacation. He expressed optimism at the airport about the conference to be held in Paris on July 12 to discuss the Marshall Plan. He does not believe that the failure of the Paris Tripartite Conference last week indicates that the Soviet Union has announced its final decision. He believes that the recovery of Europe requires the cooperation of the Soviet Union, and the attitude expressed by the Soviet Union's affiliated countries regarding the invitations from Britain and France is quite optimistic. Lie also said that he does not intend to attend the Paris conference when it opens on Saturday. He also does not believe that the United States intends to send observers to attend, but the development of the conference will be notified to the US Ambassador to France. This is Lie's first month-long vacation since taking office as Secretary-General of the United Nations, and his family also returned to the country with him.</p>
<h3>Zhenli Bao Reporter Says Britain and France Harbor Malice</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 6th] A Zhenli Bao foreign affairs reporter recently published an article stating that the initiators of the Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference had decided in advance to destroy any possibility of the conference's success in order to take action alone. The ill intentions can be seen from the agenda proposed by the initiators. In short, the reason why the Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach an agreement was due to the position of the British and French representatives.</p>
<h3>Greece Formally Invited to Participate in Paris Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 7th] The Greek government today formally confirmed that it has accepted the invitations from Britain and France to participate in the Paris economic conference.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 6th] A statement regarding the British-Soviet trade negotiations being held here will be issued in the coming days. It is reported that the British delegation led by British Secretary of State for Foreign Trade Wilson intends to extend their stay for a week to ten days before returning to the UK. The British side hopes that the Soviet Union will supply as much wheat and feed as possible to Britain with its 1947 harvest. The Soviet Union also intends to supply Britain with the aforementioned grains in the four years before 1950. Britain believes that if the Soviet Union wants to obtain major financial concessions, then Britain must be able to obtain a large amount of grain from the Soviet Union's 1947 harvest.</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Withdraws from the International Labor Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our News] London, 7th Radio: International Labor Bureau Director Fee announced that Yugoslavia has notified the Bureau of its withdrawal from the International Labor Bureau.</p>
<p>The Mystery of "Flying Saucers": Rumors of them Being as Large as Five Rooms; Similar Monsters Found in Canada</p>
<p>[Reuters, Spokane, Washington, 7th] News today says that the mysterious "flying saucers" in the American sky have landed in the foothills near St. Mary's, Idaho. According to a Mr. Johnson, he saw eight "flying saucers" fall into the forest. The flying saucers flew in from the north at extremely high speed. Near St. Mary's, the speed gradually decreased, and they fell like falling leaves, but after landing, they disappeared without a trace, and the trees were not damaged in the slightest. The flying saucer looks like a round washing basin, with an area about the size of a five-room house. Officials have not yet believed the aforementioned rumors. However, a jet plane at Muroc Air Force Base in California yesterday and six fast fighter jets in Portland, Oregon, were prepared to chase these "flying saucers." An officer of the US Army Air Corps in Washington told this agency that the Army Air Corps has been investigating the "flying saucer" rumors for ten days, but has not yet found out what they are. We do not believe that anyone in the country or abroad can have a rocket bomb with a speed of 1,200 miles per hour. We have not engaged in any experiments that can explain this mysterious object, and we do not know whether government personnel inside or outside the government are engaged in such experiments. Rocket scientists are as confused and do not understand as we are. A science writer once said that he had seen a "flying saucer" near his home, but it was the reflection of the aircraft's body.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 6th] Canada today reported another discovery of a "flying saucer." Various European capitals reacted with skepticism, believing it to be similar to the "mysterious fireballs" seen last October, disappearing as mysteriously as they appeared. According to reports, in October of last year, military authorities announced that equipment had detected a certain "mysterious fireball" passing over Switzerland, but its nature could not be determined. It is speculated that it may be a fire test on the coastline controlled by the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>French Socialist Party Congress Supports Ramadier's Policies; Government Willing to Work Hard to Stabilize the Country</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Prime Minister Ramadier addressed the Socialist Party National Congress today, emphasizing that France must act quickly to lead the economic recovery of Europe. He believes that only by responding to Marshall's plan and cooperating can European countries restore their economic balance. When Ramadier mentioned the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan, he said that the door remains open for the Soviet Union to join. He then described the domestic situation, saying that the government intends to maintain an orderly path between the extreme left-wing elements who launch strikes and riots and the extreme right-wing elements who raise the anti-communist banner in an attempt to change the republican regime. As for the government's economic policy, its goal is to combat absolute state control and absolute uncontrolled economy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] After a nine-hour meeting last night, the French Socialist Party National Congress approved Prime Minister Ramadier's government's policies by a vote of 2,576 to 2,058, with another 127 abstentions. Two other resolutions were passed: one to protect and support Marshall's European aid plan, and the other to call for the implementation of far-reaching economic recovery measures in the country. The first resolution stated that the Marshall Plan is a unique opportunity to establish a European recovery plan, and expressed gratitude to the American government and people. The second resolution requires the government to balance the ordinary budget, reduce military spending, curb inflation, investigate prices, and rectify wages. The Socialist Party's participation in the government is conditional on the National Assembly immediately authorizing the implementation of the above-mentioned economic plan.</p>
<p>A Split between the Socialist and Communist Parties is Inevitable</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] A draft by the Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party declared last night at the party's executive committee that the mistakes made by the Communist Party in France and the mistakes made by the Soviet Union internationally have made it impossible for the French Communist Party to regain power at present. According to those in charge, even the left wing of the Socialist Party now admits that the split between the party and the French Communist Party is already certain.</p>
<h3>The US Army Department's Mobilization Plan Achieves Initial Major Success; Hundreds of Industrial and Public Agencies Support It</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to the US Army Department's disclosure on the 6th, hundreds of industrial and public agencies have united to support the Army Department's mobilization plan, so that if another war occurs, a trained manpower source can be provided to serve in the troops immediately. According to the Army, this plan to form 20,000 reserve units in industries, hospitals, and city governments across the country has achieved major initial success. The organization of the reserve army is still based on veterans who served in the supplementary force during World War II, and all railways, hospitals, chemical companies, and aircraft and automobile factories are included in this plan. According to the Army, the plan to organize these agencies is now proceeding as quickly as possible. In the event of a war, the Army will require these agencies to provide trained personnel, and the Army will be able to send them to the battlefield to perform combat missions without undergoing long-term training.</p>
<h3>Twenty Prominent Americans Oppose Universal Military Training</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] Twenty prominent Americans participating in the National Council Against Conscription attacked the universal military training plan advocated by President Truman's advisory committee on the 6th, stating that it would truly cause World War III and end the life of the United Nations. Members of the council, including former Secretary of the Navy Daniels, University of Chicago President Hutchins, Senator Johnson, and National Farmers Union President Patton, all condemned the plan, saying: The advisory committee's promise to the nation that it could save itself by preparing for war in the event of a showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union is shocking. The council attacked the advocacy of universal military training as an emphasis on nationalism rather than internationalism, and to this end, they put forward the following alternative methods: 1. Frankly admit that the only security for the United States lies in the elimination of war. 2. Adopt a universal disarmament plan. 3. Strengthen the United Nations' power to resolve all world disputes. 4. Promote relief and rehabilitation plans for the peoples of the United Nations, including the Soviet Union. 5. Replace compulsory military training with voluntary training until the world organization and disarmament are completed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Tests Sound Wave Detector</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] The Navy Department announced on the 6th that preliminary tests have been completed on a detector being conducted to discover the location of a person falling into the sea, or the location of a person rescued at sea by air. The Navy Department said that this new invention can predict the location of the victim before rescue ships and aircraft are dispatched. The new invention is named the sonic range finder. The first station has been operating in Monterey, California. Several four- or six-pound bombs dropped near the Hawaiian Islands can have their sound waves received at Monterey, 2,300 miles away. If an aircraft crashes into the sea, the victim can release a sound wave bomb, which propagates through the water at a speed of one mile per second, and can be received by a detection station on shore. By comparing and studying the sound waves heard at each station, their exact location can be discovered. According to the Navy Department, this test was conducted last year in the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean, receiving the sound waves of a bomb dropped 3,100 miles away in Dakar, Africa. Official estimates put the maximum distance at 6,000 miles.</p>
<h3>International Grain Conference to Open in Paris Tomorrow; Representatives from Fifty-Two Countries to Attend</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris, 6th] The International Grain Conference is scheduled to be held in Paris on the 9th of this month to study the grain needs of various countries. According to officials here, the discussion of the grain needed by various countries is related to the Marshall Plan. However, the convening of the International Grain Conference was decided before the Marshall Plan was announced. The International Grain Conference is hosted by the International Emergency Food Committee of the Food and Agriculture Organization and will invite representatives from 52 countries around the world to participate, with 130 agricultural experts serving as advisors to the representatives of various countries. The purpose of the meeting is to avoid future food shortages. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson will deliver the opening remarks, which are expected to touch on the Marshall Plan's proposal for the reconstruction of Europe. Although the issue of grain prices is not on the agenda, it will be discussed.</p>
<h3>Various Political Parties Express Dissatisfaction After Japanese Government White Paper Released; Ashida Advocates Using Japanese Assets Abroad as Compensation</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese Diet began a free discussion of general policy on the 7th. Each party selected eloquent speakers to serve as questioners, including Sanichi (Democratic Party Executive), Ozawa Saego (lawyer) from the Liberal Party, Ishida Ichimatsu (orator) from the People's Cooperative Party, Doi Naomi (General Federation executive) from the Socialist Party, Kawaguchi Yoichi (agricultural association executive) from the Farmers' Party, and Hayashi Hakuro (lawyer) from the Communist Party. During the House of Representatives meeting, representatives from each party first gave ten-minute speeches on the economic white paper, which were then answered by the ministers. The focus of the questions remained on food policy. The Liberal Party opposed the report as being too pessimistic, saying that it caused the nation to lose hope for reconstruction. Commerce and Industry Minister Mizutani replied, "The facts are the facts; why can't they be reported?" Communist Party member Tokuda said that what the report said about the livelihoods of workers was utter nonsense. The free discussion of the economic white paper will continue for about two weeks. On the other hand, the House of Councillors also freely discussed the economic emergency measures recently announced by the government, with eight representatives from various parties questioning on political, economic, diplomatic, and financial issues. The revision of railway fares without Diet deliberation also became an issue, keeping the government busy responding.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo, 7th] Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi declared in the Diet today that if the compensation principles established after World War I are still valid, then Japan's assets abroad should be considered as compensation. According to well-informed sources, Japan's assets abroad will likely be considered as compensation, but it is not known whether this principle is valid.</p>
<p>True Foreign Trade Must Begin After Treaty is Concluded</p>
<p>A council member also raised the question of "How does Japan intend to develop foreign trade?" Commerce and Industry Minister Mizutani Chozaburo replied: "After the Allied merchants arrive in Tokyo, we will discuss specific methods, but I would like them to understand that true foreign trade can only begin after Japan's peace treaty is concluded." Finally, the councilors unanimously rejected extending the session until August 30. The meeting was originally scheduled for 54 days and was to end on August 7.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese House of Councillors resumed its plenary session at 10:08 AM on the 7th. First, Democratic Party Councilor Ito Toyoharu raised questions. The various state ministers replied as follows: (1) State Minister Wada considered the issue of balancing with the world economy when deciding on economic emergency measures, but domestic efforts are necessary to the greatest extent in order to obtain foreign aid.</p>
<p>Japanese Working Masses Should Also Endure Sacrifices</p>
<p>(2) State Minister Nishio, representing the Prime Minister, replied to Communist Party Councilor Hosokawa Karoku, saying: The Socialist Party is not sacrificing the laboring class to protect the interests of big capital. However, Japan is currently in a national crisis, so the working masses should also endure suffering in order to revive the nation. The Socialist Party's policies have not fallen to the level of the Liberal Party's policies, but the Socialist Party does not hold an absolute majority in the Diet, so it is inevitable that its original policies cannot be fully implemented.</p>
<p>Three-Party Agreement Not Reached on Coal Mine Nationalization Issue</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese government's three governing parties, the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party, held a consultation on the issue of coal mine nationalization on the 7th. At the meeting, the Democratic Party argued that increasing coal prices would not enhance production, so it was necessary to nationalize coal mines. The three governing parties did not have a unified opinion on this issue and adjourned without reaching a result.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Emergency Cabinet Meeting Convened</h3>
<p>New Note to be Presented to the Dutch Side</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] London, 7th Broadcast: The Indonesian Republican Cabinet convened an emergency meeting in Java to consider re-presenting a new note to the Netherlands. According to well-informed sources, the wording of the new note is very unfavorable and may ignite renewed fighting. The cabinet meeting was held shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit returned. According to Dutch sources, Governor-General Van Mook informed Setyadjit that Indonesia's note was unacceptable. Therefore, Mr. Setyadjit specially returned to Java in an attempt to get the Cabinet to make further concessions.</p>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 7th] Indonesia believes there are still some points in Van Mook's operation that are easily misunderstood and need to be clarified. Therefore, Republic Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit returned to Java this afternoon, and an emergency meeting was convened. The Dutch authorities specially sent a plane to escort him. The points that need to be clarified are, first, the interim government; second, the Republic's responsibility for internal affairs; third, the joint gendarmerie; and fourth, foreign relations. The Dutch side considers each of these points to be the most important. Setyadjit said he hoped to return here tomorrow.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Committee Approves Trusteeship of Former Japanese Mandated Islands</h3>

Marshall and both Secretaries of the Army and Navy attended the debate.</p>
<h3>Serious European Population Problem Has a Significant Impact on the Future of Europe</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Editorial Office of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Europe's population problem today is unusually serious. In the two years after World War I, over one million people left Europe. In the two years after World War II, very few people were able to leave Europe.</p>
<p>According to the International Refugee Organization, the total number of homeless refugees in European countries today is over one million. In addition, there are another nine million people leaving Eastern Europe. Besides these groups, there are countless Europeans who want to leave that shattered continent. According to some experts, the number of people currently intending to leave Europe is about 100 million.</p>
<p>For almost a century, until 1930, people streamed out of Europe to sparsely populated parts of the world. The number of people moving out varied, but it never stopped. In the past century, an average of 500,000 people moved out each year.</p>
<p>Europe's economic and political crises have driven emigration to a peak. The Irish famine of 1847 and the German revolution of 1848 sent large groups of starving people and refugees to safe and free areas. The industrial revolution in Eastern Europe caused a large number of farmers to move to the cities, which was the last major exodus.</p>
<p>After that, new press blockades were erected. Until the early 20th century, the United States received 80% of European immigrants, with a total of 40 million Europeans entering the United States. However, the implementation of immigration restrictions in the United States in 1921, and the tightening of restrictions in 1924, greatly reduced the flow of immigration and changed its direction. In the following years, Latin America took the first place in immigration, with several British dominions led by Canada absorbing most of the immigrants. Later, immigration restrictions became a common policy in various countries, but more importantly, the global recession cut off employment opportunities everywhere. By 1933, the number of people returning to Europe was greater than the number of people leaving Europe. From that time on, the fascist countries in Europe desperately increased the population in areas that were already overcrowded.</p>
<p>Narrow-mindedness and racial hatred were elements of Nazi policy. This xenophobic psychology did not begin with Hitler; it existed in the earliest cultures. Hitler's policy was merely an intensification of it. The new serious population problem is a legacy left to the world by the Nazis.</p>
<p>Indeed, Europe's population problem today has reached a very serious stage. Europe is currently facing population pressure unprecedented in history. However, there are several places within Europe that urgently need residents and laborers. At the same time, there are many places outside Europe that have not yet been developed and can absorb a large number of immigrants. However, these countries exclude foreigners and hostile ideologies, aggravating the obstacles to immigration. Although various countries have immigration regulations, they are all accompanied by restrictive clauses that hinder the entry of foreigners.</p>
<p>The Jews of Palestine have experienced a holocaust unprecedented in history. The Nazi Party systematically murdered six million Jews, leaving one million in various parts of Europe (excluding the Soviet Union), of whom 250,000 currently live in refugee camps, and the rest are scattered in countries where anti-Semitic sentiment remains strong. These Jews are desperately trying to return to Palestine.</p>
<p>Italy's population has been squeezed to the point of bursting, and most of them are in debt. Italians have always liked to develop abroad. Since Mussolini implemented the policy of increasing the population, Italy's difficulties have been greatly aggravated. The war has further caused panic over food and jobs. The number of births exceeds the number of deaths by an average of 400,000 per year.</p>
<p>The number of French people displaced by the war is over eight million. Most of them were displaced by the Nazis. More than seven million of them have returned to their home countries, and the remaining one million are still wandering around Europe, homeless.</p>
<p>The conflict of ideas and ideologies has divided Europe. Political exiles are everywhere. Of the more than 350,000 Spaniards who fled Spain in 1939, they are still confined to southern France, hoping that the day of political clarification will come and they will be able to return to their homeland.</p>
<p>Despite suffering losses from the war, Germany's population has increased by 1.5 million. Germany's current territory is only three-quarters of what it was before the war, and most of the people are old, young, sick, and disabled. The population density is 519 people per square mile, which is 62 times the density of the United States.</p>
<p>What Britain lacks most is manpower, and what it needs most is coal. In order to supplement the manpower needed by the coal mines, transportation industry, textile industry, and other industries, it has to employ female workers and foreign laborers.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's population increased by 20 million during the war, but it urgently needs 7 million laborers today. Soviet officials admit that 890,000 German prisoners of war are still working in the Soviet Union, but outsiders estimate their number to be about 3 million.</p>
<p>France is also currently using German prisoners of war to supplement the population lost due to the war. France currently lacks 1.4 million laborers and hopes to recruit them from Italy, Ireland, Algeria, and Germany. (Translated from "U.S. News &amp; World Report")</p>
<h3>Spanish Citizens' Referendum Approves Succession Law; Voting Order Generally Good in Various Regions</h3>
<p>[United Press Madrid, 7th] According to unofficial vote counts tonight, the Spanish people have approved the Law of Succession by a majority of ten to one. After tabulating more than half of the voting districts nationwide, United Press shows that 5,664,904 votes are in favor, 350,477 votes are against, and another 195,855 votes are blank.</p>
<p>[Reuters Madrid, 7th] Spanish Interior Minister Bayens told foreign reporters that there were no unexpected incidents nationwide during yesterday's voting on the Head of State Succession Law.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Madrid, 7th] Spain held a referendum yesterday to vote on the new Law of Succession. According to the final results, 83.2 percent of the voters in the capital region voted in favor, accounting for 72.5 percent of all voters in the region. Interior Minister Jiang Caizi told foreign reporters last night that the voting order was good, and the general mood was pleasant. Only two telephone lines were cut in the Liria region. The Spanish Morocco General declared the referendum to be a pro-Franco parade. Ninety-six percent of voters in Ceuta and Melilla voted in favor, and the situation was the same in the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. Mainland Spain performed best in Castile. The Law of Succession authorizes Franco to choose his successor, a provision that has aroused strong opposition from royalists.</p>
<h3>MacArthur is Headstrong; Australia Expresses Extreme Indignation</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] Australia is dissatisfied with the US occupation policy in Japan, and its relationship with the US may experience friction. It is said that when the peace conference on Japan is held, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will state his opinions. Evatt went to Japan on Sunday to inspect and prepare for the Japan peace treaty conference to be held in Canberra, Britain, next month. Therefore, it is expected that he will express his opposition to MacArthur in person this week. The basic reason for the dispute between the US and Australia is that Australia originally wanted to play a major role in handling post-war policy towards Japan, but has now been relegated to a secondary position, and is therefore expressing indignation. It is especially unhappy with MacArthur's actions, as if the United States is unilaterally in charge. In addition, the disputes between the US and Australia also include the following: (1) The US has obtained most of Japan's trade, which Australia firmly opposes. Of the private business firms that can do business with Japan, which were determined last Thursday, the US received 102, and Australia only 23; (2) MacArthur allowed Japan to engage in development work on Angaur Island, which was supported by Secretary of State Marshall, but Australia's protest was ineffective; (3) Australia demanded that Japan not engage in private airline business during the control period; (4) Australia protested against not being allowed to participate in the handling of the Japanese fleet that should be retained, and Australia needs some small warships and water tankers; (5) On the issue of compensation, Evatt believes that the Far Eastern Commission is not the proper body to decide this issue and advocates leaving it to the peace conference for discussion. Evatt is also deeply concerned that the committee may draft the peace treaty with Japan before the peace conference is convened.</p>

<h3>India Will Become a Battlefield; Gandhi is Grieved</h3>
<p>[United Press New Delhi, 6th] Today, the Assam and Northwest Frontier Provinces held a referendum. Gandhi declared in the parliament here tonight, "Every child in India is prepared to fight to maintain national defense. European history will be staged in India. It is heartbreaking and shameful to think of India becoming an airport. I pray that God will lead us away from darkness and towards light." Gandhi also said that Assam and the Northwest Frontier Province should part as friends, but this is not the case, which is very sad. The Indian army will also be split, and the future two countries of India will become armed camps, which will inevitably increase huge military expenditures. Shahir, the leader of the Congress Party and Prime Minister of the Northwest Frontier Province, also said that the province should secede from India and Pakistan and become independent. Gandhi agreed with this. The leader of the Muslim League said that this attitude attempts to undermine Governor-General Mountbatten's plan for partition, and believes that most of those in the province who belong to the Muslim League or sympathize with the Muslim League. Observers here feel that the people of the Northwest Frontier Province are brave and good at fighting, and have been the most difficult nation to govern in India for many years. The result of the vote will definitely be that the majority will agree to join Pakistan.</p>
<h3>Referendum Begins in India's Northwest Frontier Province</h3>

<h3>Opening of the Third Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce Union. Examination and Discussion of Proposals to Begin Today. Resolution to Telegraph Support for Chairman Chiang's Mobilization Order. Wang Xiaolai Expresses Two Hopes at the Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The third joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce held its first session at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 3:00 PM. Thirty-one directors and supervisors from various provinces and cities across the country have registered, including 13 directors present, 16 proxy representatives, and 2 supervisors, which meets the legal quorum. In addition to the directors and supervisors, guests present at yesterday's meeting included Lu Jingshi, Director of the Social Affairs Department; Ouyang Lun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs; Peng Erkang, Secretary of the Organization Department; Liu Qiguang, Chairman of the Taipei City Chamber of Commerce; and National Assembly representatives Dai Tianqiu and Zhu Huiji. All directors and supervisors, in response to the National General Mobilization Order and Chairman's broadcast appeal to the nation, passed a resolution to telegraph President Chiang expressing their support.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the conference had received a total of 57 proposals, which were scheduled to be examined in groups starting at 9:00 AM this morning and discussed at the afternoon session. The conference was chaired by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Union, who stated in his opening remarks: According to the association's articles of association, a meeting must be held at least once every six months. Although this is the third joint meeting of directors and supervisors of this term, it is the first time it has been held in Shanghai. The Shanghai branch office of the association is ready and will officially open today (July 7), with Shou Jingwei as the director. Furthermore, Luo Qinghua, the first Secretary-General of the association, has requested to resign due to poor health, and Shou Jingwei has been appointed to succeed him. Observing the international economic trends and the hardships of domestic industry and commerce, there are two points I would like to sincerely discuss with you all: (1) I hope the government will implement economic reform plans as soon as possible to stabilize finance, curb prices, and save industry and commerce from their current crisis. (2) Economic stability is based on labor-management coordination. At present, disputes often arise between the two sides, which is a hidden worry for society. I hope the conference will discuss this in detail and propose solutions.</p>
<h3>The Government Strengthens Bandit Suppression, Industry and Commerce Unite in Support</h3>
<p>Lu Jingshi then delivered a speech, saying: The reason for the current economic crisis lies in social instability, that is, the scourge of bandits. The government has strengthened bandit suppression, and the industrial and commercial sectors unite in support. At the same time, he expressed great sympathy for the industrial and commercial sectors' request to increase the number of legislative members. Peng Erkang said: In the past, there was no connection between the industrial and commercial sectors themselves, so the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Union has a major mission in the country's economic construction. The Chairman has indicated that bandit suppression and resistance against [omitted text] are equally important, so the current period can be described as "suppressing bandits and building the country." Ouyang Lun said: The Chamber of Commerce Union is the leading organization of the industrial and commercial sectors, and the main task now is to cooperate with the National Government's General Mobilization Order. After the officials finished their speeches, Dai Tianqiu reported on the process of striving for the number of National Assembly representatives from commercial groups, and Liu Qiguang reported on the recent situation of industry and commerce in Taiwan and its importance in the trade with Japan. At this point, the directors present, including Lu Xiaobo (Jiangsu), Wang Yiqi (Nanjing), Ji Dianchuan (Tianjin), He Yagu (Guangdong), and Qiao Senrong (Ningxia), spoke one after another, expressing their unique insights and detailed analyses on taxation, foreign exchange, and the government's various economic policies. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM, and at 7:30 PM, the Chamber of Commerce Union held a welcome dinner at the Shanghai Municipal Bank Club for the directors who had come from afar.</p>

<h3>Eight Organizations Telegraph Support for the Chairman's General Mobilization Order</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, and the Municipal Local Association, among other organizations in this city, telegraphed the Chairman to express public opinion in support of Chairman Chiang's recent promulgation of the National General Mobilization Order. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Chairman Chiang Kaishek of the Nanjing National Government, most urgent, since the victory of the War of Resistance, the national territory has been restored, and the wounds of war are being healed. The central government and the people are making a new start, working diligently day and night, hoping to unify government orders and implement the constitution. All that has been done is as clear as the sun and stars. However, the Communist Party has harbored evil intentions for a long time, acting like bandits, occupying land with soldiers, betraying the country and harming the people, difficult to return from their misguided path, evil exceeding its limits, so that the universe has no day of clarity, and the people are trapped in fiery heat. The central government has the heart of great benevolence and wisdom, and takes swift action, eliminating treacherous villains, launching punitive expeditions, eradicating fierce beasts and floods, and raising weapons. Recently, the National General Mobilization Order has been promulgated, in order to concentrate all efforts and quell the rebellion. Divine strategy and subtle tactics are used to enlighten and instruct. Our association, etc., on behalf of all the citizens of Shanghai, pay our respects to this grand plan to save the country and rescue the people, and express our absolute support. We hope that the ten items of governance will be implemented vigorously, swiftly and decisively, working together in the same boat, quickly sweeping away the traitors, and restoring a clear universe. We respectfully submit this telegram to express our intentions, and humbly request your consideration. The Shanghai Municipal Council, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Shanghai Municipal Fishermen's Association, and Shanghai Municipal Local Association jointly submit, [omitted text]."</p>
<p>In addition, the Minzhi Jianguo [People's Governance and National Construction] also telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, supporting the General Mobilization for Communist Suppression.</p>
<h3>Yu Shuping Officially Appointed Police Chief, Formal Announcement Expected Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yu Shuping has been internally designated as the official Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and this matter may be formally announced today.</p>
<p>According to Commander Xuan, before this, Tao Yishan, Yu Shuping, and Yu Jimin were recommended as candidates to succeed the Shanghai Police Chief. At the time, Tao's voice was very high, but after the General Mobilization Order was issued, the authorities believed that Tao's position as Chief of the Garrison Command was very important and should not be changed. Yu Jimin also serves as a member of the Shandong Provincial Government, and cannot leave his post for ten days at this critical time in Shandong's military affairs. Therefore, it was finally decided that Yu Shuping would succeed him. Moreover, Yu Shuping came to Shanghai with Director Xuan after the victory, and has been in charge of Shanghai's police administration for two years, making great contributions. Yu studied police administration in Germany and Austria in the past, and after this official appointment, he will surely be able to display his talents.</p>

<p>Oil Allocation Plan Under Review</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The deadline for applications for rice allocation for factories, schools, hospitals, prisons, and charitable organizations for July has been set for the 15th by the People's Food Allocation Committee. According to Zhang Shude, the head of the committee's review department, those whose applications were rejected in June were due to non-compliance with the regulations. The quantity reductions were due to inaccurate numbers of people, as the allocation committee determines the number of people based on the rosters previously registered and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau by the various labor unions.</p>
<p>The plan for allocating oil based on population is currently under review by President Zhang of the Central Bank, and is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Two Labor Disputes Resolved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The index dispute between the employees of 53 factories in the wooden loom group of the city's weaving industry has been resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. It was agreed that the wages for May would be calculated at 20,000 times the index. In order to consider the difficulties in the capital side business, from June to September 15, during the slack season, wages will be paid at 23,500 times the May index, regardless of the monthly increase or decrease in the published index. Base salaries of 30 yuan or more will still be calculated with the government-stipulated discount.</p>
<p>The wage disputes between the employees of Tianyuan Wei Wang Factory and Tianran Wei Jing Factory, who demanded that wages be calculated using the index, have also been resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Regarding the request for salary adjustment by all employees of the Broadway Building belonging to the Seventh Reception Center of the Lizhi Society, the Society's Affairs Bureau received an order from the Social Affairs Department stating that since it is not a government agency, it can be judged by labor and management.

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Request Rent Reduction, Capital Side Only Agrees to 10% Discount</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The rent for rickshaws in this city was previously agreed upon by labor and management on February 17, setting 6 jiao as the base and calculating it according to the previous month's cost of living index. Now, because the cost of living index was unfrozen in May, the burden on rickshaw pullers has increased. At the same time, the increase in new public bus lines has greatly affected the rickshaw business, so they requested to pay rent at a 60% discount. The capital side stated that if the rent for July is calculated according to the index, it should be 15,000 yuan, but now it is no more than 11,000 yuan. In addition, the price of car licenses is high, which is difficult to maintain. If it is to reduce the impact on business, the maximum discount is 10%. Yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation session, but no results were achieved. The Social Affairs Bureau plans to propose a compromise.</p>

<h3>Five Million People Urgently Awaiting Assistance, Establishment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Disaster Relief Association, Sun Ke and Others Jointly Host Expanded Fundraising, Hoping All Sectors Will Not Hesitate to Contribute Generously</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Ye Gongchuo, Wang Yunwu, and Liu Weizhi, in order to expand fundraising for the Guangdong disaster, specially jointly hosted a reception for people from all walks of life in Shanghai at the Kang Le Grand Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to report on the situation. More than a hundred guests attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jilou, Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, and Wu Yun Chu. Mayor Wu arrived at the venue before the meeting, but left in a hurry due to other business and did not participate in the meeting. Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yunwu, and Ye Gongchuo were unable to come to Shanghai due to various reasons, and Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, and Liu Weizhi represented them in hosting the meeting. Chairman Sun Ke gave a speech, saying that the severity of the flood disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi this time is even worse than the Xijiang disaster in the fourth year of the Republic [1915]. More than sixty counties in Guangdong have been affected by the disaster, with millions of victims. If emergency relief is not provided, the victims will be in an unbearable situation. The Executive Yuan has ordered the Relief Administration to allocate food and relief funds, and the State Council has also approved an emergency [omitted text] proposal for the National Bank to first lend 20 billion yuan for emergency relief. Furthermore, fundraising is being carried out extensively throughout the country and overseas. However, the scope of the Guangdong disaster is very large. According to estimates by the Provincial Government and the Headquarters, the first phase of emergency relief requires as much as 300 billion yuan, so the relief work must be borne by the whole country, and please all sectors of Shanghai do their best to [omitted text].</p>
<p>Relief Funds Require 500 Billion</p>
<p>After Vice Chairman Sun finished his speech, Liang Dechao reported on the disaster situation in Guangdong, saying that the disaster in the fourth year of the Republic was due to the flooding of the Xijiang River alone, while this time, four rivers flooded together, so the disaster is extremely severe. Among the 108 counties in Guangdong, 52 counties have been affected by the disaster. There are more than 5.5 million victims, and the number of dead and injured that has been calculated is more than 5,000. Guangdong has a rainy season harvest once a year, and now the last season's harvest is completely hopeless. About 30% of the dikes and other projects have been destroyed. The provincial government's initial report estimated that 300 billion yuan would be required for relief. Recently, Director Zhang of the Headquarters came to Shanghai to talk: in addition to 350 billion yuan for relief, 150 billion yuan is also needed for dike repairs, so a total of 500 billion yuan is needed to be effective. However, the funds currently available are only 20 billion yuan lent by the National Bank, 10 billion yuan in donations from Guangzhou, and 800,000 Hong Kong dollars in donations from Hong Kong (equivalent to 7 billion yuan in national currency), which is truly a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem.</p>
<p>The Disaster Situation is Urgent and Cannot be Delayed</p>
<p>After the report, the Presidium invited Du Yuesheng to speak. Du was weak and had difficulty breathing when speaking. His speech was very short, expressing that disaster relief does not distinguish between regions and that he would follow the gentlemen and do his best. Pan Gongzhan then spoke, saying that he sympathized with the plight of 5 million compatriots in Guangdong who have been displaced by the floods and lack food and clothing. If 100,000 yuan is used to maintain the life of each person per month, the total will require 500 billion yuan, and with the current pressure of life, 100,000 yuan is only the bare minimum. The disaster situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. Although Shanghai's industry and commerce are not very prosperous at present, it does not have the man-made disasters of North China, nor the natural disasters of Guangdong and Guangxi, so the citizens of Shanghai should work together in their capacity as compatriots to rescue the Guangdong disaster. Based on the history of disaster relief, Shanghai is often responsible for the majority. Whenever there is a disaster in any part of China, Shanghai must not hesitate to do its part. This time, we should continue the past spirit of disaster relief and work together with other places to relieve the Guangdong disaster.</p>
<p>All Sectors in Shanghai Cannot Stand Idly By</p>
<p>Xu Jiguang said in his speech that the business community in Shanghai is mainly composed of people from Guangdong and Ningbo, and now that there are disasters in Guangdong and Guangxi, Shanghai cannot stand idly by. Fang Zhi said in his speech that Guangdong is the hometown of the Founding Father of the Republic and the birthplace of the revolution, so the people of the country are particularly concerned about the disaster in Guangdong. The citizens of Shanghai will definitely do their best to assist the affected compatriots, and the municipal party department will follow the gentlemen and do its best. Wu Yun Chu, Li Cangbo, Qin Runqing, and Yang Xiaotian then spoke successively, expressing their sympathy for the Guangdong disaster and their willingness to do their best to assist in disaster relief.</p>
<p>Vice Chairman Sun Takes Office as Chairman</p>
<p>Dong Tianmin, the person in charge of the Shanghai Dianyi Association, said on the spot that he has convened people from the performing arts circles in this city to form a Guangdong Flood Relief Committee, which will hold a charity performance at the Tianchan Theater for three days starting on the 16th of this month, with the income used for disaster relief. Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang have agreed to participate, and ticket prices are divided into 200,000, 150,000, and 100,000 yuan. At this point, members of the Presidium Wang Chonghui and Liu Weizhi successively stated that the Guangdong disaster is severe, and there is also a flood in Guangxi. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire, so they decided to establish the Guangdong-Guangxi Disaster Relief Association immediately and planned to invite Du Yuesheng to serve as the chairman of the board of directors to proceed as soon as possible. After Du repeatedly declined, Sun was nominated Vice President to serve as the president, with Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilou, Fang Zhi, Wu Yun Chu, Yang Xiaotian, Cheng Cangbo, Feng Youzhen, Fan Shaozeng, Gu Jiatang, Dong Ganwen, Zheng Ziliang and his wife, and Sun Zhesheng's wife serving as standing directors. It was also decided to hold the first board meeting at the Shanghai Bank this Friday at 5 pm.</p>

<h3>The Re-appointment of Professors in Various Universities in the City Will Be Decided After Director Zhu Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss the issue of re-appointing professors for the next semester with the heads of various universities.

<h3>Protecting Teachers' Professions and Stabilizing Education in the City: Director Gu Continued to Reply to City Primary School Requests Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 50 directors and supervisors of the City Primary School Friendship Association and representatives from various districts gathered at the Central No. 1 School in the Fifth District yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to continue to make requests to the Education Bureau. Xu Ziling accompanied Director Gu and Director Zhu to the meeting. The director gave a detailed explanation of each point requested by the association, saying: "The regulations for the appointment and dismissal of teachers and staff will be the same as the separate regulations for principals, and he promised to issue re-appointment orders to the principals of each school immediately, which will allow the principals to re-appoint teachers and staff in stages. Protecting teachers' professions and stabilizing education in the city is what the principals expect and is also the decision of the senior leadership. The salary for July has already been answered by Deputy Director Li and will definitely be issued early. The Municipal Council approved the expenditure for this academic year by appropriating 7.2 billion yuan from the existing 20% of education funds, and the bureau should comply with this. However, the municipal treasury is tight and the appropriation of funds is slow, which has caused all teachers and staff to suffer from the depreciation of the currency, which is deeply regrettable. Recently, the accounting office has been instructed to concentrate all other funds in the bureau as much as possible and first raise and distribute 200,000 yuan per person before July 10, and the remaining amount is also being sought. As for the item of borrowing tuition fees from parents in the next semester, there is no legal basis, but there are understandable reasons. If all parties can be contacted to avoid increasing the burden on the poor and children of public teachers, and wealthy parents are happy to donate for the education of their children and to understand the hard life of the teachers, he will give principled sympathy to it from an individual standpoint. As for the payment of salaries based on the cost of living index, as long as all teachers and staff work hard in their positions in cooperation and stability, the central government will definitely have the hope of adjusting it in August and September. It is heard that the abnormal development of the current treatment of public teachers is being closely watched by Director Zhang of the Executive Yuan. Everyone has the same feeling that it is not a matter of quantity but of inequality, and calling for survival is not a dishonorable act." The representatives of the association were deeply moved by the director's earnest words, and they decided to follow the director, share weal and woe, and were unwilling to turn their backs on the request. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. The parts that could not be resolved immediately were planned to be submitted to the next board of directors meeting to continue to work hard with all parties concerned.</p>

<h3>The Import Control Committee Negotiates with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., to Improve the Allocation of Industrial Raw Materials; Fixed-Price Contracts Must Be Countersigned by the Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from our newspaper] The Industrial Raw Material Import Quota Allocation Review Committee, organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association, was invited yesterday by Shen Zouting, the director of the Quota Allocation Department of the Import Control Committee. Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Wu Jichun, and others attended as representatives to discuss the matter. Both parties hoped that the quota could be regulated and insisted that trade associations should proceed with caution. According to this conversation, the contract between the importer and the fixed customer, which originally required the trade association to which the fixed customer belonged to sign and certify, will now be countersigned by the Review Committee. The application and fixed-price contract accumulated in the Allocation Department, which has not yet been reviewed and completed, will also be subject to this regulation. How to make a reasonable allocation for foreign factories and commercial firms was also discussed yesterday, but no concrete decision was made. According to sources familiar with the matter, some commercial associations often carelessly sign and certify for their members, allowing them to enter into contracts and place orders with import firms. The allocation cannot be discussed, and there is no investigation into how many fixed orders have already been certified and what the content is. The competent authorities are deeply concerned about this. Yesterday's discussion was clearly related to this. After the representatives left, they convened 45 industrial and commercial associations related to the allocation of chemical raw materials at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM that afternoon. The Review Committee prepared a list of allocation rates based on the declarations of each association, which was passed on the spot, and an agreement was reached. A few associations that had submitted supplementary declarations earlier were not listed and will be slightly revised. The Chemical Raw Materials Commercial Association also sent representatives to attend, but there was no concrete way to participate in the allocation. The Review Committee proposed a ratio of 10 to 1, so that it could obtain 1/10 of the total quota to sell to industries in the vicinity of the city, but no agreement was reached. According to an authoritative person, the quota allocation of industrial raw materials should focus on supporting industry. North China, South China, and Central China also have separate quotas. The quota obtained by distributors here is used to assist neighboring provinces and cities. In terms of the current situation of the chemical industry, the ratio of 10 to 1 is still considerable. However, the commercial association expressed difficulty due to the large number of members and will negotiate again in the next few days. In addition, an agreement has been reached with the commercial association on the bark glue used by the leather industry. Because it is also needed for indigenous leather making in the interior, it is said that the allocation ratio has been set at 8/10 and 2/10.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares Rise Unabated, Yong Sha Particularly Profitable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, buyers of Hua shares were concentrated in Yong Sha, not as much as others. Small-cap shares were particularly weak except for Zhongfa, which had its own absorption, and retreated instead of advancing. Yong Sha reached its limit very early. After several struggles, it finally traded at a premium. Before Yong Sha's capital increase, people had high expectations, and the trend was very profitable.</p>
<p>At the opening in the morning, people were in good spirits and opened high. After Yong Sha opened, it went from No. 108, No. 154, No. 31, No. 56 to 10400 yuan.

Yong Sha first rose to the limit, followed by Yonggong, which also rose to the limit. Yong Sha then quickly rose to the limit, and No. 91 and No. 1 rose to 10700 yuan. No. 224, No. 232, No. 102, No. 231 were sold at around 10450 yuan. No. 117 and No. 78 advanced to the limit again. No. 224, No. 223, No. 91, No. 2, No. 218, No. 232 were sold, and it was inevitable that the rise would slow down. Tongyi rose to the limit. Afterwards, small-cap shares such as Ruofeng, Xin, Jingfu, etc. reached their peak and declined. Yong Sha continued to rise, conducting market transactions. Numbers 89, 85, 60, 191, 102, 224, 36, 104, and 152 all came to make up for the transfer. The black market called high to 10950 yuan. Letters and Harmony were bought up, arousing a strong reaction. Numbers 157, 224, and 228 were once sold within 10800 yuan. Cement rose to the limit. Numbers 223, 226, and 102 had even stronger buying interest. At the close, it rose to about 11250 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Finally, it ended outside 11200 yuan. Zhongsi once forced a limit up before closing. Xinya closed at the limit. Compared with last Saturday, Yong Sha reached the limit, as did Yonggong. Xinya and Meiya each rose by about 10%. Zhongfa rose by about 15%. Guangjing, Bianqin, Xinghua, and Huafeng each rose by about 5%. Xinhua rose slightly. Zhongsi had a pullback after rising to the limit, up by 10%. Xinya Cement and Tongyi all rose to the limit.

In the off-market, old shares Nanyang, Wuzhou, and Huashang each rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly, not exceeding 5%.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds and Foreign Shares Have Minor Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds had minor ups and downs, with a lot of trading in between. Unified Class C opened at 7400 yuan, and Rooms 533, 512, and 555 all advanced, rising to 8100 yuan. Room 360 took the opportunity to close out and then fell back to close at 7600 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, Class A and B fell slightly by 200 yuan, Unified Class C rose by only 100 yuan, Unified Class D fell by 100 yuan, and Unified Class E was flat. Trading increased slightly to about 2 million.</p>
<p>Foreign shares retreated after rising yesterday. Yisha opened in the morning and rose to 87,000 yuan. Securities firms and foreign firms closed out, falling back to 82,000 yuan. Guang Gang and Bank Gang bought in, and finally hovered around 85,000 yuan. Hong Kong quotations shrank slightly, and the process was uncertain. Compared to last Saturday, estimated gauze Jardine Matheson, Wheelock and Guangwei rose slightly, Paper fell slightly, and the rest were flat.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth All Show Strong Profitability</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw limited sales from yarn mills and little release from other traders. The market atmosphere was initially stable, but later, various parties searched for goods eagerly, and traders held back, reducing prices sharply. As a result, 42-count gauze rose to 20 million yuan, a sharp increase of 1.1 million yuan compared to last week. 20-count Double Horse yarn was 12.4 million yuan, an increase of 1 million yuan. Double Horse yarn rose by 800,000 yuan to 10.9 million yuan. The remaining 32-count Blue Bell, Silver Moon, and 20-count Tiannu Ren Zhong, 16-count Guangming Red Bee, and 10-count Boy Scout all increased by 300,000 to 700,000 or 800,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market saw retail investors buying and traders pushing up prices, resulting in a consistently strong market in the morning. 12-pound starter cloth rose to 457,000 yuan, Wufu to 419,000 yuan, and 3A Rainbow Ball to 400,900 yuan. Each thin cloth rose by a large amount of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to Saturday. The Yangtze River gang made inroads into Yuangfeng and Zhigong cloth. Bleached cloth also saw healthy demand, rising by 20,000 yuan. The prices of Shilin cloth and other factory goods continued to be adjusted, with increases of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The markets for other coarse cloth, blue cloth, Yuan oblique poplin, etc., were consistently strong.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was calm in the morning and suddenly tightened in the afternoon. In the market, cotton yarn rose again, and people were excited. The silver root was loosened, and transactions were quite active. Yarn mills had strong demand, and customer gangs also added to their positions, so Ling Sai cotton opened at 1.95 million and rose to 2.1 million in the afternoon, but few sales were made. Vendors still wanted to see the market outlook, and the results were strong. 1/16 Mittellin opened at a factory price of 2.42 million, Ling Sai at 1.94 million, 1.95 million to 2.1 million, and 2.15 million. The stock price was 2.13 million to 2.14 million for 7/5 Mittellin, 1.7 million for Dachung Jixirong, 1.7 million for Sanyuzhen, 1.84 million for Hanxi, 1.65 million for Hancu, 1.58 million for subgrade, 1.4 million for Chen Hankou Cuxirong, 1.9 million for Shashi, 1.84 million for Chong Shashi, and 285,000 to 300,000 for Zhoupu Zihua.</p>
<h3>Fangjian Door Market Tests Retail Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] Yesterday, China Fangjian Co. sold 1,308 pieces of yarn on behalf of the Spinning and Weaving Commission, all to manufacturers. There were a total of 586 purchase orders.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to stabilize yarn prices and maintain direct users such as rural areas and small factories, the company decided to start today to try out retail yarn sales at the company's second door market (at the intersection of Jinling Road and Guangxi Road in this city) every day. The selling price will be based on the negotiated price of cotton yarn, plus a 10% profit for retail sales. The maximum purchase amount per person per time shall not exceed five small packages.</p>
<h3>Silk Design Committee to Be Established Soon; Liu Gongyi to Serve as Chairman</h3>

<h3>Woolen Summer Goods Decline</h3>
<p>Woolen summer goods such as feather yarn, pilot cloth, flannelette, white pique, and white Zhigong, etc., are flooded with factory shipments, and the actual sales days are few. In the middle of last week, the downstream was already gradually falling. Unexpectedly, because of the rising prices of all goods last week, summer woolen goods also soared by 20%. As a result, customer gangs buying appetite was even lower, while sellers wanted to take advantage of the shrinking sales season and also wanted to roll over and make autumn and winter goods, and yesterday the market did not fall in price, with an average decrease of about 10%.</p>
<h3>High-Quality White Japonica Rice Sees Slight Increase; Supply and Demand for Food Rice Are Balanced; Flour Continues to Decline Inland, Clearly Stable but Secretly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 4,800 stones of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. The south market rose first and then fell back. As a result, the high-quality goods of Japonica and Indica rice rose slightly, while the medium- and low-quality goods were fair. White Yuan rice was still slow to sell, and prices were generally weak. Medium- and low-quality Customer Yuan rice was seldom consulted. Supply and demand in the north market were balanced, with no significant ups and downs.</p>
<p>Flour opened in the morning with firm support from traders, but store demand was weak, and the inland market continued to decline, making it difficult to rise, and the market was clearly stable but secretly soft. The early market for foreign flour saw an increase of more than 1,000 yuan, but transactions suddenly weakened at noon. The inland market slightly advanced for wheat bran, rising by 21,000 yuan, and the market was in a rotation pattern. Soybean cake Shantou was moving to process, and Yingkou cake soared by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, and factory soybeans also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans rose sharply with the rise of Shantou cakes, rising back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Green beans saw pick-up in the south, and stepped up by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while medium and low prices were flat. Adzuki beans were slow to sell and fell by another 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum had little arrival and sales, and the market was temporarily stable. Corn also had little fluctuation. Sesame was procured by foreign traders, and the scarcity made it expensive, rising sharply and soaring by 20,000 yuan. Under the fierce purchase in southern China, raw peanuts rose sharply and soared by more than 20,000 yuan. Broad beans had slightly active customer sales, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat declined with the step down inland, and followed it weakly. Only small flour mills had slight transactions, and prices continued to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Fufeng and Fuxin had no intention to purchase.</p>
<p>Registration Required Before Buying and Selling Rice</p>
<p>Also reported: It is learned that in recent days, many large households and customers have secretly sold rice and grain, so the rice market has off-market transactions. If such things continue, accidents will inevitably occur. The municipal authorities and the rice industry association attach great importance to this. According to the person in charge of the rice market management committee yesterday: In the future, anyone who intends to sell rice and grain must apply to the market in advance for registration and must not arbitrarily buy and sell privately in the market and off-market.</p>
<p>Oil Extraction Method Has Been Decided</p>
<p>[Our newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau recently transported a batch of soybeans from the Northeast, totaling 2,300 tons, and it has been decided to entrust each member factory of the Oil Extraction Industry Association to extract oil. It is stipulated that each dan of soybeans must extract seven and a half catties of oil and 1.87 sheets of soybean cake. The Central Trust Bureau will pay each factory a labor fee calculated at 20,000 yuan per dan of soybeans. The extracted oil will be allocated by the civil food allocation and the distribution method will be determined. The Central Trust Bureau will be responsible for selling. The method of selling soybean cake will be determined by the Central Trust Bureau.</p>
<h3>Buyers Search Actively, Rayon Price Soars, Factory-Managed Silk Goods Also See High Prices</h3>
<p>Rayon prices have risen madly. The market was still stable yesterday morning. No. 210 Takayama Yusen opened at 27.4 million yuan, and closed at 8.2 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, because the silk factory gang had no rayon to distribute for the Lianying company's raw materials, they had to purchase them to weave, and they searched in the black market, resulting in unprecedented high prices. The fierceness of the rising wind made people stunned. In the afternoon, it rose to 9.8 million yuan, and finally reached a high of 30.5 million yuan for transactions. Dongyang and Tianqiao and others all rose by 3.8 million yuan compared to the weekend. 75th half light has a asking price of 40 million yuan, and the scarcity is a bargain. The rise is endless, and silk manufacturers are greatly affected.</p>
<p>Yesterday's factory market was also slightly firm and expensive. The D grade of 5 dan head with high uniformity had transactions, and the price was 33 million yuan. The E grade goods with a lower quality had a market price of 1.7 million yuan yesterday. Another dan of high-grade D grade goods was traded at 32.5 million yuan. Yesterday, dry warp also had transactions, and the additional dan price was 21 million yuan. The 5 dan head has not been opened, and the asking price has also been raised.</p>
<p>The best-selling silk good yesterday was the silk quilt cover. The asking price for American Asia quilt cover reached 14 million yuan, but no transaction was made. Dacheng quilt cover opened at 12.7 million yuan, and then rose by another 150,000 yuan. Huqiang quilt cover first had a transaction at 12.6 million yuan, and then rose to 7.5 million yuan. Da Cheng Gezi wall cloth was gradually falling out of favor, so it was unable to rise. Yesterday, the immediate price had a maximum of 41,800 yuan and a minimum of 1,200 yuan. It was also traded, and the final price was 1,400 yuan, with no significant ups and downs from the price last weekend. The deferred price was 1,600 yuan. Huajin crepe of rayon goods had no goods on the market in the afternoon due to the flying price of raw materials. The asking price was 28,000 yuan. The price of other goods remained unchanged due to very few transactions.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil and Pig Bristles Exports to be Handled by the Central Trust Bureau; Price Review Committee Established for All Matters</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to ensure a steady flow of tung oil and pig bristles exports, the government has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau (CTB) with the responsibility of purchasing and selling these two export commodities. Upon receiving this commission, the CTB has established a Price Review Committee within the bureau to determine the purchase and sale prices and quantities on a daily basis. The Export Promotion Committee has also appointed representatives to participate in the supervision of these purchase and sale matters. Regarding the purchase and sale methods, in addition to the CTB's head office purchasing from merchants and selling to exporters, its branches in various locations and overseas agents may also handle the transactions directly. Only exporters are eligible to purchase tung oil and pig bristles from the CTB, and payment must be made in foreign currency. Merchants and exporters engaged in the tung oil and pig bristles business should maintain close contact with the CTB's Barter Trade Department, which will make every effort to facilitate them. The above measures apply nationwide. The CTB and its branches in various locations have been ordered to implement purchases from merchants in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Chongqing, Wanxian, Changsha, and Wuzhou. Sales to export merchants will be conducted in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. However, the Tianjin and Guangzhou branches should first consult with the Shanghai head office when local merchants inquire about prices and other export-related matters, and the head office should respond as quickly as possible. Furthermore, the above measures are part of the government's plan to promote the export trade of seven major commodities. This plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Detailed measures for other commodities, besides tung oil and pig bristles, are currently being drafted by the relevant authorities. Once approved, they will also be implemented as soon as possible to break the current deadlock in export trade.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Shows Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat, with both increases and decreases. The Association's official quotation for No. 20 medium-grained white sugar was 590,000 yuan, then 586,000 yuan, up by over 10,000 yuan. Taiwan red sugar was 556,000 yuan, up by 6,000 yuan. Shantou Jieyang green sugar was 420,000 yuan to 425,000 yuan, up by 7,000 yuan. Cotton red sugar was 455,000 yuan to 463,000 yuan. "Diao Qing Zong" was 370,000 yuan to 375,000 yuan. Xinghua white sugar was 555,000 yuan to 560,000 yuan, up by a little over 10,000 yuan. Xing red sugar was 450,000 yuan, down by 12,000 yuan. Inferior grades were only 410,000 yuan. A total of over a hundred deals were concluded.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Shows Steady Sales; Wenzhou Mao Hong Tea Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market, although transactions were still limited, showed a trend of stability. As some exporters continued to inspect samples of "Chou Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" grades for sales to Africa, sentiment remained positive. Domestic sales of red and green tea were gradually increasing amidst the scorching sun. Wenzhou Mao Hong tea, and teas from Fengjing and Jiashan areas, were particularly in demand, with increasingly active transactions and prices considered strong.</p>
<p>Guangdong buyers' demand for top-grade white Gong chrysanthemum tea was unsteady. Due to sellers' attempts to raise prices, the situation reverted to its previous state and became quiet. According to industry insiders, this year's Wuyuan newly fried green tea was facing slow sales at the origin, while demand was still high. Therefore, merchants were dispatching personnel to the production area for transport. Consequently, the local tea market has also improved. It is reported that current production prices have been driven up to 450,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Overall, this situation suggests a potential upward trend in the future.</p>
<h3>Central Authorities Hope the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee Will Quickly Determine a Regulatory Plan; Governor Zhang of the National Bank Convened a Discussion Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Cotton yarn prices have been rising steadily in recent days. The central authorities are paying close attention to this situation. They believe that although the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee has convened several meetings since its establishment, a complete cotton yarn and cloth adjustment plan has yet to be produced. Given the current trend of cotton yarn prices, it is essential to establish a clear and decisive regulatory policy and implement it in the short term.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, Governor Zhang of the Central Bank specifically convened a discussion meeting with directors and supervisors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association and members of the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee to resolve various difficulties and pending issues related to the implementation of the current cotton yarn adjustment policy. It is reported that the discussion resulted in a principled agreement on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) For the 60,000+ bales of foreign cotton allocated to various factories by the Head Office in April, May, and June of this year, and the 32,000+ pieces of cotton yarn produced, each factory should submit the details to the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee within one week. The purchase price will be standardized at 6,500,000 yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. (2) It was originally decided that the government would purchase half of the yarn spun from foreign cotton exceeding the quota in the first quarter. Now, it has been decided that the government will return half of the cotton payment already made by the factories, and provide interest based on market rates. Half of the cotton within the first quarter quota will be issued by the government to factories for processing on behalf of the government, and the government will pay the factories a reasonable processing fee and profit. For the second quarter's foreign cotton exceeding the quota, as few factories have made payments, the government has decided to return all of it. All of the foreign cotton within that quarter's quota will be issued by the government to factories for processing on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>In addition, issues such as how to determine the processing fee and how to comply with price agreements were also discussed. According to the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, its member factories have already submitted 8,000 bales of yarn for collective distribution, and they will be able to submit a total of 10,000 bales within days.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee originally scheduled a small group meeting on finished product transportation, sales, and pricing for yesterday morning. However, as several outstanding issues remained to be resolved in consultation with Governor Zhang of the National Bank, the meeting was postponed and will be held at 10:00 AM today. The fourth committee meeting will be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Rise with Increased Purchases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soap market was lively at the opening, especially for Sunlight and Royal brands. It was reported that customers from Nanjing and Hangzhou were commissioning purchases, so buying interest was strong. There was also strong real demand in the market for Xiang Mao, Gu Ben, Arrow, Dao, Guang Hua, and other soaps. Coupled with speculative purchases from outside the industry, supplies were tight, and sellers were holding out for higher prices, causing prices to rise sharply. By the afternoon, Gu Ben soap had jumped to 500,500 yuan per case, Arrow soap to 495,000 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao to 338,000 yuan, and Guang Hua soap to 310,000 yuan. The prices of other soaps, such as Henry, Cow Brand, Sun &amp; Moon, Ding Feng, etc., also rose by 5,000 to 16,000 or 17,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Head Office's Third Batch of Foreign Currency Allocation Methods Have Been Determined</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Head Office's second batch of 100,079 bales of foreign cotton has arrived. The 10th committee meeting of the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Transportation Management Committee has determined the allocation method for this batch of foreign cotton to various factories, with reference to the foreign cotton quota for May to July in the second quarter of this year. The decision has been submitted to the Head Office for reference. The requirement that factories have 3,000 or more spindles remains a prerequisite for allocation. According to statistics, 85 yarn factories, including Shen Xin, in Shanghai and other areas, are eligible for allocation. Once they receive notification, they can contact the Head Office. China Textile Construction Company has the largest allocation, receiving 44,989.38 bales. Yong An Factories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are second, receiving a total of 5,366.13 bales. Shen Xin Factory 9 is third, receiving 3,249.23 bales.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market is Bullish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market turned stable and bullish. This was because the prices of various public utilities were about to be adjusted, and cigarette taxes were also increasing. The factories' production costs were increasing, and factory prices were gradually rising, which stimulated strong buying in the market. Furthermore, out-of-town merchants temporarily stopped dumping inventory, leading to a shortage of supply and extremely high market sentiment.</p>
<p>Ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes opened at 7,600,000 yuan, then briefly fell, but soon buyers became active again, and prices reversed to show strength. The afternoon market was filled with buying interest, with demand exceeding supply, and prices rose steadily. In the end, ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes rose sharply by 400,000 yuan compared to the (Sunday) afternoon closing price, to 7,920,000 yuan. Old Knife cigarettes were 6,920,000 yuan, up by 370,000 yuan. Five-Flower and Hartmen cigarettes rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Ten-pack and twenty-pack Qianmen cigarettes from the Yi Zhong Company, and Da Nan Wei and Da San Pao cigarettes, were selling strongly, rising by 1,500 yuan to 2,600 yuan per carton. Chinese-made cigarettes such as Beauty, Golden Mouse, Bank, and Three Cats also mostly showed progress. American-made cigarettes such as Camel, Six Roots, Morris per carton, and 50-pack canned cigarettes, also showed firm stability.</p>

<h3>The Melancholy Envoy of Yan River Surveys the Flooding in Southern Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Nanning, 1st (Airmail Dispatch) by Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>Full of Melancholy and Ailing</p>
<p>For a whole month, Guangxi has been completely immersed in endless torrential rain. After one wave of sorrowful clouds, another wave of sorrowful clouds follows. Low pressure squeezes out countless cries of despair. The overwhelming flood, roaring and rushing, is like a wolf or a tiger. The river channels are broken for hundreds of miles, sweeping horizontally and vertically, from the North and South Pan Rivers all the way down to the Pearl River Delta. The land is vast and boundless, the fields and soil are submerged, burying countless lives and properties. The disaster of war in the north, and the natural disaster in the south. After the knives and guns, divine punishment follows one after another. Ordinary people can't survive! ....</p>
<p>In order to let our compatriots who share the suffering understand more thoroughly how nearly a million brothers and sisters are struggling and groaning beneath the floodwaters, the reporter walked out of Guilin in the pouring rain, and quietly sneaked into Liuzhou in the great wind and rain, and then headed towards the turbulent waters of the upper reaches of the Pearl River. The closer I got to the disaster area, the heavier my heart became.</p>
<p>From Guilin to Liuzhou, ever since the Guiliu section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway was repaired, the road of over four hundred li could originally be reached from morning to evening. However, the roads and bridges, which were painstakingly repaired, could not withstand a great flood. If it's not this pontoon bridge that collapses today, it's that culvert that collapses tomorrow. This road has been compared to Lin Daiyu among railroads - full of melancholy and ailments. Therefore, train delays are not news; only when the train is on time will the newspapers publish a headline, "Today's Train Arrived on Time". When the reporter arrived in Liuzhou, he happened to encounter the Luorong Bridge being washed away by the flood. The train only went to Luorong'an (a small county town tens of li away from Liuzhou), and then transferred by ferry, pushed by another train into Liuzhou. The fact that a train has to "transfer by ferry" is hard to imagine.</p>
<p>The Northern Guangxi Plateau is Like a Mass Grave</p>
<p>The northern Guangxi plateau, man-made disasters outweigh the floods. Along the way, you can still see the rice seedlings in the fields growing well - in previous years, it would have been the time for the new grain to be harvested. The further down you go, the more you feel the thousands of desolate scenes pressing upon you step by step. Entering Liuzhou, it was near dusk. In the quiet rainy night, wandering on the streets, only the little beggars chasing behind you are many times more numerous than this time last year. Waking up early in the morning, walking on the streets, a group of "street angels" were quietly sleeping on the sidewalks, stretching from the Peixin Road intersection to the end of Peixin Road, three across, five vertically, broken bowls and bamboo tubes still tightly hugged in their arms, grinning, closing their eyes, looking like they were walking into a mass grave. Alas!</p>
<p>Small Town's Human Market Crying, Looking at Waterlogged Fields</p>
<p>The four surrounding villages are flooded, and pests are rampant. A famous small town north of Liuzhou has, until today, invisibly established an extremely lively human market. Farmers who have no way to escape the famine, unable to bear to let their families perish together, often prefer to sell all their children for around 150,000 yuan. Then, with the money, they pay off the debts borrowed for planting, and then, with a sorrowful look in their eyes, they look at the three-foot-deep waterlogged fields, which they spent their painstaking efforts on, and then move to the mountains to sit idly by, until the water recedes. Cutting out flesh to mend the wound, cannot even heal the sore in front of them. The scenes of the past two years are the same, but the people who have died in the past two years are already a different group.</p>
<p>My residence faces the Liu River. Before I finished writing a thousand-word draft, the river water had risen three times. The dockworkers endured the rain, sweating, adding layer upon layer to the floating bridge and gangplank of the big river, groaning and grunting. The "Meat Market" behind the house was also bargaining in a low voice. Occasionally, a burst of goosebump-inducing laughter would rise, only to be immediately drowned out by the torrential rain.</p>
<p>Traveling from Liuzhou to Nanning, is just a matter of one day. Using one day's time to move one's gaze over the road full of scars, truly makes one think infinitely. One year's time, good things have not gotten better, but bad things have gotten worse. From the overflowing of the Pearl River, to seeing the suffering of the people, the sights and scenes are not enough for outsiders to describe. "New ghosts are annoyed by grievances, old ghosts cry, the sky is cloudy and the rain is wet, the sound is chirping." Such a situation can be found in every corner of Guangxi.</p>
<p>Nine Counties in Southern Guangxi Flooded</p>
<p>Wandering on the banks of the Yong River, gazing at the piles of silt left behind after the flood receded, at this moment, I don't know if I hate or resent, but I feel a yellow water in my eyes, a string of sighs in my ears, and a burst of desperate calls in my mind. In six days, in a cursory survey of the disaster, I traveled through nine counties in southern Guangxi - Binyang, Nanning, Wuming, Guode, Longan, Tongzheng, Hengxian, Yongchun - unexpectedly feeling an inexplicable terror towards the滔滔 flood. As a result of the torrential rain for months, more than half of the rice stalks that were about to ripen in the above-mentioned areas were drowned to death, totaling no less than 500,000 mu. Stepping through the fields, watching the new grains lying down and moldy in field after field, there is truly indescribable sorrow and pain. Guode, Zhenjie and other places are extremely barren - in that county, except for the county government, the council, and the health department which are built of brick and tile, the entire "main street" is covered with thatch - this time the flood happened just as the new grain was ripening and the corn was bearing fruit. A flash flood broke out, and all the hard work planted against the mountain was turned to nothing. Pressed by the big river, besieged by mountains and rivers, until not a single grain was left. Farmers rushed to escape, many on the verge of death. The number of victims is more than 500,000, most of whom are homeless and starving. However, the relevant parties, those who should be eager to rescue the drowning, have not yet taken any action, resulting in the price of rice in Yongyuan once soaring to 270,000 yuan per hundred catties, setting a Guangxi rice price record. At present, the flood is gradually receding, and the people who have lost everything have returned to the fields. Gritting their teeth, they use a 1-to-2 "grain flower" - a high-interest loan, borrowing one dan of grain and returning two to three dan at harvest - to sow seeds in the fields, betting on fate once again. Near Shuangqiao in Wuming, I saw farmers busy transplanting seedlings. I happened to ask an old man who was pulling a plow with all his strength, whether the rice fields next to him were "second crop"! - that is, after the first harvest, continue to transplant rice seedlings for a second harvest in September and October. - The old fellow answered with humor and pain, saying: "The second crop is the second crop, but unfortunately the first crop was harvested by the heavenly soldiers!"</p>
<p>Girls for Sale, Red Thread Around the Neck</p>
<p>Guangxi's land is barren, and the people have long been bitter. Adding on these thousands of disasters and hundreds of difficulties, it is simply exhausting their blood and tears. On the road of Yong, I don't know how many women I saw, bare-chested, wearing tattered underwear, squatting in the fields to work, their whole bodies tanned into a lump of charcoal. If it weren't for a head of "dark clouds" and two breasts, it would be hard to know that they were some women who were so poor that they had nothing left. However, among these people who barely have time to take care of themselves, there are often some "parent officials" who are eager to establish their own "visible" "achievements." So, today they pull a group of people to repair the county road, tomorrow they pull a group of people to build some inexplicable water conservancy project, (such as in Sile County, in order to build a fire road directly to the Vietnamese border, they do not hesitate to gather the strongest men to start construction when farming is busy), causing farmers to lose their plows and harrows, pick up hoes, and run around exhaustedly, but they can't come up with a reason. The fields are barren, and the tribute to the officials is endless. Therefore, those who are in difficulty are more and more in difficulty. In Tongzheng, Funan, and other places, groups of people sell their children. Each one is calculated by age, about 15,000 to 20,000 yuan per year. A big girl of seventeen or eighteen can be had for 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Guode, I saw many girls sitting on the ground in the street with red threads around their necks. When I got closer, I thought it was a kind of decoration. Who knew that after asking, this red thread was originally the mark of the "commodity," with the highest price being 300 catties.</p>
<p>The Disaster is Most Tragic in Guode and Other Counties</p>
<p>The exact number of disaster situations, to this day, no one has figured out. The water receded, and after a heavy rain, the new flooding started again, rising and falling. It is said that it will not be stable until after the Mid-Autumn Festival. No one dares to guarantee what will happen in the next three months. At the moment, various places are starting to closely investigate the detailed number of losses, preparing to request emergency relief. According to the reporter's general investigation, the disaster situation should be most tragic in Guode, Zhenbian, Jingxi, and Pingzhi counties. The population of Guode county is less than 60,000, but the number of people who "see grass roots instead of rice" has reached more than 30,700. All the shifting cultivation fields were washed away, and there is no hope of harvest. In more than 20 townships, such as the northwest and southern slopes of Jingxi, there are more than 30,000 starving people. In a place called Pingwen Township, the most unstable situation is that the entire township has entered the mountains to cut betel nut trees and loquat leaves to satisfy their hunger. No less than thousands of trees have been felled, and there are daily reports of people falling to their deaths in the valleys due to exhaustion from cutting trees. There were also seven children who dug up a pile of cassava, happily burned it to eat, but before they could finish eating, they all died of poisoning. In Zhenbian County, the number of victims also exceeded 30,000. The harvest of the entire county is less than 10%, and people live on algae and pigweed. In Sanpeng Township, which belongs to the county, up to 12 people committed suicide in one day because they could not endure hunger. In Zhenjie County, the number of victims also reached 20,000, and more than half of the miscellaneous grains were washed away by the water. They received 3 million yuan in relief funds, which is about 140 yuan per person. In Longshan County, all seven townships attached to the county seat were submerged, and the number of starving people quickly increased to more than 8,000 households. 40,000 people stretched out their hands for help, and 36,000 mu of land were all lost, to the point that there was money but no rice to buy, and some people had nowhere to escape. Extending to Pingzhi, Tiandong and other counties, there were fields of water everywhere, and land that was not submerged. The common people ate all the grass roots, then ate mountain potatoes, and after eating all the mountain potatoes, they ate the bark of kapok trees. After eating all the tree bark, they ate the roots of kapok trees. If they were lucky enough to occasionally dig up a few bamboo shoots, it was a great meal. Driven by hunger, they often formed groups to steal peanut sprouts and miscellaneous grains from the shifting cultivation fields that were not flooded to satisfy their hunger, but they were shot at by the guards occupying the mountains. Such tragic incidents occurred countless times in the areas where the three counties of Tiandong, Pingzhi, and Guode meet.</p>
<p>From Yongning down the river, the villages along the river in Yongchun and Hengxian were also reached by the God of Waves. In Pumiao Township, more than 10,000 mu of sugarcane, peanuts and miscellaneous grains were flooded. The losses in various townships of Hengxian, such as Jiangkou and Nanxiang, also reached more than 50,000 mu. Down to Nanjiang in Guixian County, which was originally the only sugar-producing area in Guangxi, most of the sugarcane fields have now been submerged due to the disaster. Those that have not been submerged have also suffered irreparable damage due to prolonged rains and pests. How farmers will make a living this year is simply unbearable to ask!</p>
<p>Cutting Flesh to Heal Sores; Grievances Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>Before the disaster, there were grain storage facilities in various places to deal with emergencies. However, most of them were in the hands of local tyrants and gentry for no reason when the people were waiting for rice. The grains that were supposed to save the people from water and fire were used to save their own pockets. The high-interest loan trick, which could not be higher, was played out by these people. For a debt of 20,000 yuan, they want one dan of grain in September. The common people have no choice but to cut flesh to heal sores, taking the grain they usually send in for storage, but they have to pay ten times the interest. It is truly unknown where to start talking about such grievances! As for those emergency relief teams that acted in previous years, they have now become a relic of the past in Guangxi, which also makes the refugees feel that "there is no trace of compassion in the world". However, these are all small things. When the water level of the West River was at its highest, it reached 80 meters. The water has receded slightly in recent days, and it is unlikely that it will cause further harm, so prices have fallen in recent days, especially the price of rice in Nanning, which has fallen from 260,000 to 140,000 yuan at the highest speed of decline. Therefore, people's hearts have also become more stable, although the gangsters in the 100,000 Mountains, who are always suspicious, are constantly threatening this empty land (the so-called Democratic Allied Army based in Lingshan Guode recently infiltrated the Shuichun area of Quan County, creating a tense situation).</p>
<p>Looking at this flood, the situation in the upper reaches of the Pearl River is not necessarily worse than the disaster in the lower reaches of the delta. The only difference is that one is the first to bear the brunt and the other is the culmination of disasters. It is natural that a hundred measures to treat the symptoms will not get rid of the word "money". The work of treating the root cause needs to be discussed further. To give one example, the reporter drove between Gui and Yong, for more than 1,000 li. Counting, he lingered among the mountains, and all he saw was bare, barren land. From Liuzhou to Qianjiang, a distance of 200 kilometers, only one tung oil tree was found, which is truly a "rare sight of trees". It is up to people to prevent disasters, it is not enough to shout slogans. What's more, the common people have so many things they can't say.</p>
<h3>Sir Alexander Paterson Speaks on: The New Type of Prison</h3>
<p>— Reuter's Dispatch from Leiden, June 24th, Sent to Shanghai</p>
<p>Sir Alexander Paterson, who pioneered the world's most modern prison at Ley-hill in England, has traveled extensively to study prisons. He recently published new insights on prison reform. The key points are introduced below: The essence of long-term imprisonment is, firstly, to serve as a deterrent, so that those who are subjected to it deeply reflect and dare not re-offend. Secondly, it addresses the concern that the effect of short-term imprisonment is too weak, and it is necessary to extend the years of confinement in order to improve the person's heart and mind. However, those who are sentenced to long-term imprisonment can be divided into two categories in terms of their character. The first category includes thieves and other habitual criminals. The second category includes political prisoners or those who committed manslaughter on impulse. These people are not accustomed to committing crimes, but act out of circumstance or necessity, committing occasional errors. Most countries' prisons, due to outdated laws, often confine these two fundamentally different types of long-term offenders together without distinction. The British authorities, recognizing this, have begun to specially separate criminals who have accidentally fallen into the legal net and use new methods of confinement. Firstly, they prevent them from coming into contact with "habitual criminals." Secondly, they are given considerable freedom, each assuming a certain degree of trust and responsibility, allowing them to stay within a defined area under minimal supervision without strict confinement. They are allowed to talk and laugh with each other and are exempted from all strict regulations. They are provided with recreational activities such as books, newspapers, movies, music, and theater. They are given work or study that suits their individual nature, abilities, intelligence, and age, with a set timeframe to observe their progress. This is supplemented by beneficial physical outdoor exercise and opportunities to balance their mental and physical strength during work breaks. Those responsible for supervision are no longer ordinary prison guards but are replaced by trained and highly educated personnel. This is because the application of intimidation in the old-style prisons is insufficient to improve the character of criminals, and may even degrade them. Prison authorities in all countries are well aware of this experience. However, there is still a danger that can be easily encountered when implementing this new method. This means that if prison officials occasionally fail to inspect, one or two habitual criminals may inevitably enter the facility, causing the initial attempt to promote and implement this new approach to be destroyed.</p>
<p>In ancient times, defeated heroes and villains became war criminals and were confined to islands to spend their lives. How much better would it be for those less severe cases to replace imprisonment with island residency, and shackles with observation. With no way to escape, the cost to those defending would not be high. This is a well considered plan. If we want to nurture the character of long-term or permanently imprisoned scholars, allow them reasonable freedom of movement, benefit the people economically, and make a satisfactory contribution with their abilities, nothing is better than selecting an island surrounded by water. Establish key defenses and provide all necessary facilities for healthcare and livelihood, and relocate them there. This could solve the problems that most criminals pose and address the extreme shortage of talent in China. It would be better than the imperial examination system, encouraging them to atone for their crimes by contributing their abilities, requiring them to submit their work on time. If the Chinese value these insights from the British gentleman, it would not only bring about intangible education for turning over a new leaf and reforming oneself, but also achieve tangible economic benefits by avoiding idleness and wasted resources. These two accomplishments would be remarkable. It would benefit the government and the people in terms of people's livelihoods and national economy, creating a completely new situation. Perhaps there would be unexpected gains that people cannot even dream of. Not only could internal strife be quelled, but someone might devise ingenious plans, and even in the face of resource scarcity, a new village could be found on a dead end road. As for the regulations on redeeming sins through merit, how they should be stipulated to align with both reason and sentiment, the country is not short of legal experts representing public opinion, who will naturally handle the matter well, so there is no need for the reporter to offer further advice.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation of Partitioning India and Pakistan</h3>
<p>— Reuter's Dispatch from New Delhi, June 28th, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Zhou Xiangguang</p>
<p>In early May, I wrote a dispatch pointing out that the partition of India and Pakistan was inevitable. Only a month later, the partition of India and Pakistan has begun. The British government's statement on June 3rd to return power to India is the Magna Carta of the partition of India and Pakistan. The five key points of the Magna Carta are as follows:</p>
<p>Key Points of the Charter</p>
<p>(1) On February 20th of this year, the British government declared that it would return power to India in June 1948. It originally hoped that the various political parties in India could jointly draft a constitution according to the British parliamentary delegation's plan and establish a unified India. This wish has now become a bubble.</p>
<p>(2) At present, the Constituent Assembly, in provinces where the Muslim League has a majority, such as Bengal, Punjab, Sindh, and British Balochistan, has not sent representatives to attend. It is feared that the constitution determined by the assembly in the future will not be adopted by the aforementioned provinces. To respect the public opinion of the region, whether they join the current Constituent Assembly or another constitutional body should be decided by the people of each province themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Once one or more regimes are produced by the above methods, the British government will grant Indians the status of dominion within this year.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the two provinces of Bengal and Punjab, where the number of Hindus and Muslims is roughly equal, their provincial assemblies should be divided into two units, one representing the provinces where Muslims are in the majority, and the other composed of representatives from the remaining counties. These two units should meet separately. If either side votes in favor of partition, then the province should be partitioned.</p>
<p>(5) The Northwest Frontier Province should hold another referendum.</p>
<p>All Parties Agree</p>
<p>When this new plan was proposed that day, the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Sikh community, under the pressure of the environment, agreed to accept it. Therefore, after the Governor-General of India broadcast the above plan on the evening of June 3rd, a conference was held with speeches by leaders of various parties. First, Mr. Nehru, the representative of the National Congress, explained: "Unity cannot be forced, partition is the mother of union." His words were poignant and moving. Next, Mr. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, explained: "Although this plan does not fully meet our original wishes, it is necessary to negotiate. However, whether the Muslim League is willing to accept it still awaits the final approval of the Muslim League Executive Committee. At present, we hope that Indians and Pakistanis will live together peacefully and avoid any disputes." His words were calm and profound. Finally, Mr. Baldev Singh, the Sikh representative and Minister of Defense of the interim government, explained: "The partition of India will not last long, and cooperation will still be necessary in the future," placing endless hope on the future of India.</p>
<p>The four-thousand-year-old ancient country of India has since been divided into two countries, one being Hindustan (the National Congress is unwilling to use this name and retains the name India) and the other being Pakistan (meaning the holy land of Islam). From June 3rd to today (June 44th), Bengal and Punjab provinces have been divided. East Bengal belongs to East Pakistan, West Punjab belongs to West Pakistan. What has not yet been decided is the Sylhet district of Assam, which is adjacent to East Bengal and is a majority-Assamese area. A vote must be held on whether to join Pakistan or Hindustan. However, in my opinion, the district will undoubtedly belong to East Pakistan. The vote is just a formality.</p>
<p>What India and Pakistan are most concerned about is the referendum in the Northwest Frontier Province. This will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Avoiding Bloodshed</p>
<p>I have already said that Jinnah still needs to submit the new plan to the Muslim League Executive Committee for discussion on whether to agree to accept it. In fact, Jinnah is the dictator of the Muslim League. If he says yes, everyone says yes; if he says no, everyone says no. This is what those of us in India know. Because the senior members of the Muslim League, such as Finance Minister Ali Khan, were all promoted by him. Jinnah is now seventy-two years old. He and Nehru's father are old friends. No one dares to oppose what he does. The ability of the Muslim League to unify is perhaps one reason for this. However, the senior members of the National Congress are all old friends, so they must discuss important matters together. Nehru is not a person who actually wields power in the National Congress. The Muslim League held a meeting at the Imperial Hotel in New Delhi on June 10th, attended by more than 400 people, and unanimously passed the resolution to accept the new plan and authorized Jinnah to handle and deal with everything in the future. When Jinnah presided over the meeting, thousands of Muslims shouted: "Supreme Leader Jinnah is the Shahan-Shar (Emperor) of Pakistan!" When the old man Jinnah heard this, he felt uncomfortable and said, "I am not an emperor, I am an old soldier of Pakistan!" This was also an interesting anecdote at the meeting, adding much color.</p>
<p>Following the Muslim League, the National Congress Party held an Executive Committee meeting on June 15th to discuss the issue of accepting the new plan. All the leaders of the National Congress Party were present that day, including Gandhi. After a fierce debate, the congress passed the resolution with a majority of 157 votes to 29 votes. The most important point in the reasons for accepting was that it is better to split up in order to seek peace than to force unity and see the tragedy of sectarian bloodshed again. This is something we should admire. The National Congress Party has always advocated independence, peace (non-violence), and unity. Now, sacrificing unity in order to achieve independence as soon as possible and hoping for peace to appear sooner shows their painstaking efforts to tolerate each other for the sake of the country. This is of course also possible because the Muslim League does not have a million-strong army.</p>
<p>This new plan of the British government has now been agreed to by the two major political parties in India. Strangely enough, the die-hard conservative Churchill also agreed to it. He gave a speech at the East India Association in London on June 11th, believing that the British Labour government's policy towards India "is entirely correct in general!" He later praised Governor-General Mountbatten, saying that he had made great contributions in India, and that this great contribution also belonged to the person who sent him as Governor-General! This time, old Churchill was indeed being reasonable, unlike before, when the government said what was right, he would definitely say what was wrong, and when the government said what was wrong, he would definitely say what was right, with that kind of die-hard mentality.</p>
<p>Northwest Frontier Province</p>
<p>Now we need to talk about the Northwest Frontier Province. Approximately nine out of ten people in the Northwest Frontier Province are Muslims, but the cabinet is controlled by the National Congress Party. Moreover, because of property restrictions, very few people in India have the right to vote. Therefore, during last year's general election, under the command of the National Congress Party cabinet, they won the victory. The Muslim League is not reconciled to the Northwest Frontier Province's willingness to follow Hindustan. Therefore, since this year, bloodshed incidents have continued to occur in the Northwest Frontier Province. Nehru was also stoned by the local people in the Northwest Frontier Province, resulting in a bloody head injury. Therefore, in the new plan, the British proposed to hold another referendum. This point is beneficial to the Muslim League. However, the National Congress Party knows that the Muslim League will win if there is a referendum. Therefore, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (referred to as Frontier Gandhi), the Muslim leader of the National Congress Party in the Northwest Frontier Province, advocates that a Pashtunistan should be established in the Northwest Frontier Province, which does not belong to Hindustan or Pakistan, but is an independent country. This point is to divide the Northwest Frontier Province again, like the Bengal Province. Jinnah is naturally unwilling to do this. When bloodshed incidents occurred in the Northwest Frontier Province, all Hindus and Sikhs left the province. The Muslim League did not invite these people to return to participate in the referendum. At the same time, Jinnah has sent his senior staff member Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, who is currently the Minister of Commerce of the interim government, to the Frontier Province to plan everything. Jinnah will also go to the referendum. Judging from this, the Muslim League will definitely not rest until it obtains the Northwest Frontier Province. In my opinion, the Northwest Frontier Province will definitely belong to Pakistan. However, the Muslim League will have to put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>The Future of the Princely States</p>
<p>Now that India has been partitioned, what will happen to the 506 princely states within India? Because after the British government returns power to the Indians, it will also renounce its privileges over the Indian princely states, and thereafter each princely state will have full freedom to decide its own future. Therefore, the princely states that were hesitant in the past were forced to take the following three paths: (1) Join the National Congress's Constituent Assembly, (2) Prepare to join Pakistan's Constituent Assembly, (3) Declare independence. According to recent observations, several large princely states have decided their own future. For example, the Mysore princely state has joined the National Congress's Constituent Assembly, Hyderabad and Travancore have declared their own independence, but the Jammu and Kashmir princely state has not yet decided, because the majority of the people in that state are Muslims, but the ruler is a Hindu. In the future, it may join Pakistan's Constituent Assembly. But at present, the National Congress Party and the Muslim League are unanimously appealing to the Governor-General to allow the princely states to act freely, which is not without danger. Therefore, in the future, the princely states will inevitably move towards the path of the Constituent Assembly, and perhaps the princely states will gradually disappear from then on.</p>
<p>After the Muslim League obtained the status of the Dominion of Pakistan, it actively carried out the establishment of the government. The Muslim League has decided to choose Karachi, the capital of Sindh Province, as the capital of Pakistan. The capital of East Pakistan has not yet been selected, but it will probably be selected from either Chittagong or Dhaka. The personnel of the various departments of the central government are also being divided. All central officials should immediately fill out forms stating whether they wish to serve in the Hindustan or Pakistan government. According to current statistics, almost 99% of the central government's Muslims wish to go to Pakistan. Other items such as military borders, finance, and transportation have also established small committees to plan the division.</p>
<p>French and Portuguese Territories</p>
<p>Although the mainland of India is said to be a British territory, in reality there are still several places that belong to Portugal and France. Therefore, seeing that the British were returning power to the Indians, the Governor-General of French India, Métrac, also hosted reporters in Pondicherry, the capital of French India, on the 6th of this month, foreshadowing that there would be important administrative reforms in French territories. He said, "The ruling mechanism of French India naturally belongs to the local people." He also said, "I and the French Minister to India, Ross, visited Nehru and reported to Mr. Nehru on the Indian-French cultural exchange and development plan. I said that France values the friendship of the great Indian nation and has no political or economic desires other than this. France's wish is to make Pondicherry, French territory, a place for Indian-French cultural communication." From then on, the future France has decided to return the French Indian territory to the Indians. However, Portuguese India Goa, the Portuguese government has declared that it will never return it to India, just as Portugal will never return Macau to China, which is truly a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>A Wonderful Analogy</p>
<p>India has been partitioned in this way. General Wavell once made a wonderful analogy to this. He said at the East India Association in London, "India is now suffering from the pain before childbirth. All births are unpleasant, especially when twins are born." One of these twins is called Pakistan, and the other is called Hindustan. The latter name is not recognized by the National Congress Party. But no matter what the name is, the twins are about to be born. According to Professor Tan Yunshan's analogy, India is suffering from prepartum pain, and China is suffering from postpartum pain. In short, the prepartum and postpartum pains are both equally severe. We hope that like all childbirths, the pain will be short-lived, and then we will celebrate!</p>
<h3>A Look Ahead to the Revival of the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jian</p>
<p>Throughout history, when a nation is in poverty, it seeks refuge in the mountains; when it develops, it relies on water. Our country is located to the west of the Pacific Ocean, with a coastline that winds and meanders for tens of thousands of miles. The residents along the coast are brave and enterprising. With such a geographical environment and national character, it is appropriate to traverse the seas and dominate the world. Unfortunately, the benefits of water have not been fully utilized in the past, so the tools for a prosperous life are not complete, and the strength to defend against insults is not sufficient. For decades, we have been subjected to external oppression, and the people's livelihood has been declining. The national power has been weakened!</p>
<p>Now that the War of Resistance has been won, maritime rights have been restored. After surviving a hundred disasters, we are reflecting on the pain. Looking back on the past, there are still lingering fears. After the war, there are countless things to be done. My colleagues in the shipping industry, aware of the relationship between shipping and national fortune, and that transportation is the foundation of construction, have concentrated all their efforts to quickly restore the pre-war tonnage of ships and assist in repatriation transportation. During this period, we have experienced difficulties, but we have always been mindful of the expansion of shipping, the maintenance of shipping rights, the promotion of shipping cooperation, and the negotiation of Japanese reparations ships, and have strived to do our best. However, pushing the wheel through accumulated water is only the beginning. In the future, we must make continuous progress, and the shipping industry will surely flourish. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>The author has been away from Shanghai for nearly ten years. Last time I came to Shanghai to participate in the founding meeting of the Shipping Federation, the journey was filled with tens of thousands of miles of waves, sandpipers flying, and unparalleled beautiful rivers and mountains. But when I first arrived at the shores of Shanghai, what caught my eye was the huge ships of foreign countries, their flags waving, overlooking the river. Looking at the ships of our own country, I could not see any. What is national defense? Secondly, although the number of domestic merchant ships has now recovered to 800,000 tons, they are lined up along the Huangpu River, and the number is not small.</p>
<p>Shanghai will be the shipping center of our country, with the reputation of the great port of the East. Leaders of the shipping industry, with foresight, are striving to cooperate with their counterparts across the country in addition to their own business. One call, and all mountains respond, gathering heroes from all directions to seek common prosperity for ten thousand ships. This kind of enthusiasm and effort is worthy of our special joy and encouragement, and we extend our highest respect, and send endless hope for the future of the shipping industry!</p>

<h3>On Cao Cao's Death: Historical Analysis (Part One)</h3>
<p>— Tan Zheng</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, studying in a private school, I once saw a picture in a stone-printed, illustrated Three Character Classic titled "King Ji Assassinating His Brother." A person in ancient attire, holding a precious sword, was chasing and killing another person in similar attire in a grand hall. That image is still deeply etched in my mind. Later, I read in history books about legends such as "Tai Jia Slaying His Father" and "King Ji Slaying His Brother," and I assumed that such things happened in the ancient era, and there was nothing to be surprised about. However, later, I heard the arguments of many scholars who believed that such things were against the norm, harmful to morality and social order, so they strongly refuted them as heretical and absurd, advising people not to believe them. At that time, I also firmly believed that what the scholars said must be very reasonable.</p>
<p>Later, I read more historical records, and in them, I discovered two similar events: one was Cao Pi of the late Eastern Han Dynasty "killing his father as a son," and the other was Zhao Kuangyi of the early Song Dynasty "killing his brother as a younger brother." The latter is clearly recorded in various historical books, while the former was something I discovered after carefully reading the annotations to the "Records of the Three Kingdoms." I once wrote this discovery into the fifth act of my play "Ode to the Luo River Goddess." (This play was adapted into a Yue opera by a certain troupe led by a self-proclaimed progressive female performer, but I only found out about it more than a year after their performance. I don't regret my performance rights, but I regret that this major discovery of mine has never attracted people's attention.) After learning about these two events, I thought that since the relatively advanced Han and Song dynasties could have such things, why couldn't they have happened in the ancient Shang and Zhou dynasties? So I completely overturned my previous blind belief and thought that those were not absurd things at all.</p>
<p>In order to make everyone aware of my new discovery of "Cao Pi Slaying His Father" and to jointly enrich the evidence for my new discovery, I will quote some of the not-very-substantial evidence I relied on, for those who love to explore such issues to study together.</p>
<p>To know why Cao Pi wanted to slay his father, one must first understand the triangular relationship between him, his father Cao Cao, and his younger brother Cao Zhi. History tells us that Cao Cao had many sons: the eldest son Cao Ang died in the Zhang Xiu rebellion in Wancheng, the second son Cao Pi was a poet, the third son Cao Zhang was a brave general, the fourth son Cao Zhi was also a poet, and the deeds of the other sons are not worth mentioning. However, although they were both poets, Cao Zhi was honest and kind, while Cao Pi was cunning and treacherous, so the father liked Cao Zhi. Moreover, after Cao Pi snatched the Zhen family, Cao Cao's intended target in the conquest, his aversion to Cao Pi deepened; so after he was promoted to丞相 (Chancellor) and enfeoffed as Duke of Wei, he intended to make Cao Zhi his heir. However, the cunning Cao Pi plotted deeply and worked hard to undermine his brother, finally making Cao Zhi fall out of favor with Cao Cao, and Cao Pi was made heir. So before Cao Cao died, he had already leaped to become the deputy Chancellor. When Cao Cao went on an expedition, he stayed in the capital, with high authority over everything, and he didn't even respect his own father.</p>
<p>I don't know if Cao Cao understood Cao Pi's political conspiracy, but that time when he returned from Chang'an to Luoyang, he suddenly decided to change his heir to Cao Zhi. Because he was afraid that his power would not be a match for Cao Pi, he urgently summoned Cao Zhang, who was originally told to stay in Chang'an, to bring back a large army. Regarding these, there are texts as evidence in the Records of the Three Kingdoms and its annotations. The "Biography of Prince Wei of Rencheng, Cao Zhang" says:</p>
<p>When the Grand Ancestor returned east, he made Zhang the General Who Crosses Cavalry, staying in Chang'an. When the Grand Ancestor arrived in Luoyang, he fell ill and urgently summoned Zhang. When Zhang arrived, the Grand Ancestor died.</p>
<p>The annotation quotes the "Wei Strategy," saying:</p>
<p>When Zhang arrived, he said to the Marquis of Linzi, Cao Zhi: "The reason the Guang Prince summoned me was to make you the heir." Zhi said: "No! Have you not seen the Yuan family brothers?"</p>
<p>In these two passages, we can not only see that Cao Pi indeed had other political conspiracies, but even Cao Cao's sudden illness and sudden death are really suspicious. Why didn't he return to his old home in Qiao County after falling ill, (because there he had many of his retainers who could serve him,) but stayed in Luoyang? Cao Pi had been the heir for a long time, why did he want to change the heir at this time? Even if he wanted to change the heir, why did he have to summon Cao Zhang back before changing the heir? When we think about the above questions, we know that Cao Cao at this time was already in Cao Pi's net, completely lost his freedom, and only by summoning Cao Zhang with his army could he ensure his safety and implement his plan to depose and establish a new heir. But, unfortunately, he knew too late, not only could the deposition and establishment not be realized, but he also lost his life because of it. We can read again the "Basic Annals of Grand Ancestor" in the same book, which says:</p>
<p>In the first month of the spring of the twenty-fifth year of Jian'an, he arrived in Luoyang. Quan击斩 Guan Yu,斩其首 (Killed Guan Yu,斩其首). On 庚子 (gengzi day), the King died in Luoyang.</p>
<p>In this basic annal, the above text never mentions that Cao Cao was ill, and suddenly there is a sentence "The King died in Luoyang" at the end, becoming dying without illness, isn't it very strange? So I think the person who wrote the history must have had "a subtle criticism." We can read again the "Biography of Jia Kui," which quotes the "Wei Strategy," saying:</p>
<p>At that time, the Heir Apparent (Pi) was in Ye, and the Marquis of Yanling (Zhang) had not arrived, and the soldiers and civilians were quite distressed by the labor and services, and there were also illnesses and epidemics, so the army was in turmoil, and the officials were afraid that there would be changes in the world, so they did not announce the mourning. Da suggested that it was not permissible to keep it secret, so he announced the mourning, ordering everyone inside and outside to enter to mourn. After the mourning, everyone was settled and not allowed to move.</p>
<p>The biography then says:</p>
<p>At that time, the Marquis of Yanling, Zhang, was the General Who Crosses Cavalry, coming from Chang'an, and asked Kui where the coffin of the late king was? Da said sternly: "The Heir Apparent is in Ye, the state has a successor, the late king is resting, it is not appropriate for you, Marquis, to ask." So he escorted the coffin back to Ye. Emperor Wen ascended the throne as King, and because the tens of thousands of households in Ye County were in the capital and many were illegal, he made Kui the magistrate of Ye. More than a month later, he was transferred to be the Grand Administrator of Wei Commandery. When the army went on an expedition, he was again the Master Recorder and Libationer of the Chancellor.</p>
<p>From these two historical texts, Cao Pi never went to Luoyang from Cao Cao's illness to his death, but Jia Kui and others escorted the coffin back to Ye. Where was he at this time? And what was he doing? How can this not make people suspicious of him? So I dare to assume that Cao Cao's illness was probably not an external illness, and his death was not a natural death. As for his will that has been passed down to the present, it was either made by him before his death or forged by Cao Pi later. After Cao Cao died, Cao Pi succeeded as King of Wei, and in October of that year, he usurped the throne of the Han Dynasty, which Cao Cao did not want to do during his lifetime. So my guess is that Cao Cao probably heard about Cao Pi's political conspiracy outside, so he rushed back to Luoyang. Or he only discovered it after returning to Luoyang. If he wanted to eliminate this conspiracy, he could only implement the deposition and establishment of a new heir; if he wanted to implement the deposition and establishment, Cao Pi was already the Deputy Chancellor at that time, and he could not deal with him without force, so he urgently summoned Cao Zhang with his army to help. Unexpectedly, the news leaked out, and Cao Pi simply did it all in one go, removing Cao Cao as well. And he himself never showed his face, ostensibly not leaving Ye for a single step, in order to cut off people's suspicions. And Jia Kui was probably the executor of this conspiracy, so after the success, he was greatly appointed. Although this is just my speculation based on the above-mentioned texts, and has not been thoroughly researched, there is still much circumstantial evidence, and it is definitely not comparable to unfounded and baseless talk. Not long after Cao Cao's death, according to the "Zizhi Tongjian," Cao Pi treated his brothers in this way:</p>
<p>In the second month, on 丁卯 (dingmao day), King Wu was buried in Gaoling, and the king's younger brothers, the Marquis of Yanling, Zhang, and others, all went to their fiefs. The Supervising Envoy of Linzi, 邴均 (Bing Jun), hoping to know the Emperor's mind,奏 (Memorialized) that Marquis of Linzi, Zhi, was drunk and behaved arrogantly, coercing the envoy. The King (Pi) demoted Zhi to Marquis of Shouxian, and executed the Right Rectifier,丁儀 (Ding Yi) of the Pei State, and his younger brother, 董門侍郎(Dongmen Shilang), and their sons, all of whom were Zhi's partisans.</p>
<p>If Cao Cao had not wanted to change the heir to Cao Zhi before his death, why would the brothers harbor resentment and have to treat each other in this way? Even Cao Pi's treatment of Cao Zhang is recorded in the "Wei Strategy," which is quoted in the annotation to the "Biography of Prince Xian of Rencheng, Cao Zhang":</p>
<p>After the Heir Apparent succeeded to the throne, after the burial, he sent Zhang to his fief. At first, Zhang thought that he had been trusted and meritorious by the late king, and hoped to be授用 (entrusted with power) because of this, but when he heard that he should follow the例 (precedent) (referring to following the envoys to the fiefs), he was very unhappy and left without waiting to be sent.</p>
<p>This clearly proves that if Zhang had not left the capital, he would have been severely punished, fortunately he saw the opportunity and left quickly. In the third year of Huangchu, he was suddenly promoted to Prince of Rencheng, and he thought that Cao Pi no longer held a grudge, so he went to the capital in the fourth year of Huangchu (this biography), but unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived in the capital, he "died suddenly in his residence" (this biography). The so-called "died suddenly in his residence" is the same suspicious matter as Cao Cao's dying without illness. The annotation to this biography quotes the "Spring and Autumn Annals of the Wei Family," which also says:</p>
<p>At first, Zhang asked Zhu Shou if he would have different ambitions, so he sought to come to court but was not immediately seen, Zhang was angry and died suddenly.</p>
<p>The so-called "different ambitions" here clearly refers to the matter of returning to the capital on his father's orders, and the so-called "angry and died suddenly" is of course not dying a good death. From this, it can be seen that Cao Pi's dislike of Cao Zhang was even greater than his dislike of Cao Zhi, because he was in command of troops. So promoting him to Prince of Rencheng was a deliberate tactic, enticing him to enter the capital, and finally putting him to death.</p>
<p>The unnatural deaths of Cao Cao and his sons are clearly obvious facts, but what happened behind the scenes? Who was the mastermind? What was the matter about? What was the process? Then we still have to wait for high-level historical experts to explore and search, and then we can make a decision. What I am talking about here is just a few historical materials for a literary subject.</p>
<h3>Field Work Poetry</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Warfare has made me forget this homestead</p>
<p>The pool of autumn water beside the garden</p>
<p>Only the fish swim leisurely back and forth</p>
<p>Before the courtyard, two courtyards of flowers bloom unknowingly</p>
<p>The orchard with lush branches and leaves</p>
<p>Gradually greens and then yellows</p>
<p>The mountain islands still occasionally peek into this garden</p>
<p>Lizards perch on fig or grape vines</p>
<p>I have long been familiar with the beauty of the mountains</p>
<p>The mountains are also the same to me —</p>
<p>It seems that it rained last night</p>
<p>Because I see dewdrops on the grass</p>
<p>Shining in the sunlight</p>
<p>And the mountain stones are slippery</p>
<p>The growth of moss is even greater than before</p>
<p>The vegetable garden in front of the door is still plentiful</p>
<p>Pumpkins like old men resting under long vines</p>
<p>Eggplants are so plump that one loves them</p>
<p>Chilies have ripened from green to red</p>
<p>Spending all day with crops</p>
<p>Watching autumn come and go</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>In this unrenovated old courtyard</p>
<p>I have seen flowers bloom and fall all over the garden</p>
<p>I have seen reeds let white hair droop into the water</p>
<p>I have seen banana trees die and revive</p>
<p>Oh, the luxuriant growth of mixed trees…</p>
<p>Once autumn comes, the mountains separate the world further</p>
<p>All things return to a sleeping posture</p>
<p>I fear to see the ears of grain bent by the autumn wind</p>
<p>The trees tell me of the warmth of spring</p>
<p>From now on, the mountains bow to me</p>
<p>The ruthless years cannot carve on my face</p>
<p>Looking up, I only see prosperity and decay filling my eyes</p>
<p>New graves fill the green mountains all around</p>
<p>I don't understand why</p>
<p>A thousand years of moonlight is forever silent</p>
<p>Only the small stream flows in front of the cliff</p>
<p>Spreading the lament of eternal solitude</p>
<h3>Umbrella</h3>
<p>— ·Luo Yingfeng·</p>
<p>Umbrellas float past the rainy days</p>
<p>Like a flock of painted fragrant butterflies —</p>
<p>Traveling in the rainy season</p>
<p>Growing on the damp soil</p>
<p>I opened my little paper umbrella</p>
<p>In the rain, I have a little sunny day</p>
<p>I hold my head high and run fearlessly</p>
<p>My steps are neat and firm</p>
<p>It is a bridge from rainy days to sunny days</p>
<p>Safely ferrying me to the other side of the sunny shore</p>
<p>When the residual drops of rain have dripped away</p>
<p>Then it is hidden in my forgotten corner</p>
<h3>Match</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>In the cold night,</p>
<p>I struck a match</p>
<p>Watching it bloom into a</p>
<p>Small orange-red flower.</p>
<p>A small orange-red flower,</p>
<p>Flashes a moment of light,</p>
<p>A slight warmth,</p>
<p>An indescribable, intoxicating dream.</p>
<p>I think of that</p>
<p>Girl selling matches in the fairy tale,</p>
<p>In this little flower,</p>
<p>She found ethereal comfort.</p>
<p>One flower after another blooms and fades quickly,</p>
<p>Like a beach reflecting the彩霞 (colored clouds),</p>
<p>Gradually calming bubbles,</p>
<p>Leaving behind silent darkness.</p>
<h3>Shepherdess</h3>
<p>— Segantini</p>
<p>Segantini (Giovani Segantini 1859-1899) was an orphan who lost his parents at a young age. At the age of eighteen, he was still herding sheep and feeding pigs for others. Because he loved painting by nature, he finally took his savings over the years to Milan and enrolled in art school. After learning a little basic painting, he returned to his hometown — the Alps — to continue self-study.</p>
<p>Because he loved nature and his works mostly took real life as their subject matter, he inadvertently became a respondent to the French Impressionist movement at the time. His style focuses on light, his colors are bright, and his brushstrokes are delicate and lively, showing a tendency to surpass various French Impressionist artists. Unfortunately, he "did not get what he wanted in life, and only many years after his death was he praised by historians as the pioneering representative of Italian Impressionism." Representative works include "Cultivation" and "Shepherdess," etc. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xingyu</p>
<p>On these days of continuous rain, the loneliness of the journey was already enough to make me feel sad and worried; the poplar trees on both sides of the road used to be so dense that they could block the sky and prevent the sun from shining in, but now? I only occasionally see one or two sparsely distributed, where have those dense poplar trees gone! Where has that green shade gone!</p>
<p>When I returned to this dilapidated little city, I found everything to be quite unfamiliar to me, and even relatives and old friends were as sparse as the poplar trees on the road. Only then did I suddenly realize that I had been away from this little city for a whole eleven years.</p>
<p>The city is full of荒煙蔓草 (weeds and wild grass) and ruins, only those stone memorial arches that commend chaste women and martyrs still exist. Although this is a product of cannibalistic ethics, although each arch has a story that makes people tremble, I can only use it as the only landmark to identify directions and to imagine the former streets.</p>
<p>My old residence has long been a level ground, I don't know who planted some pumpkins on it. After all, there is no fertilizer in the rubble, and the stems and leaves of the pumpkins are pitifully thin, like a child born with congenital deficiency. If the land had consciousness, it would definitely talk to me as intimately as the old people, about the sorrow of parting, or the trivial matters of my childhood and youth. I clearly remember those peaceful years like well water. Under the碧紗窗 (green gauze window), I ground a pool of 松煙墨 (pine soot ink) and wrote Yan Zhenqing's "Eulogy to the Eastern Portrait" or the collection, I walked into the park along the soft dirt road. On the stone benches, male and female students were bowing their heads to read books, preparing for the upcoming semester exams. From them, I found my own shadow, the shadow of my lost, long-lost, and full of beautiful fantasies, and now, I am already a withered person. A student cast a surprised look at me. He might think I was a wandering traveler, a stranger who accidentally passed through the park in this small city. If he knew what I was thinking in my heart, he would definitely laugh at me as being 陳腐 (corny)!</p>
<p>The护城河 (moat) was gurgling, rhythmically hitting the embankments on both sides. A fisherman was using a huge net to catch fish, paying attention to every small bubble and vortex on the surface of the water. The moment the fishing net was pulled out of the water, his expression was tense. You don't need to look at the net, just look at the expression on his face to know his results, whether it is disappointment, indifference, or pleasure. Thinking for the fisherman, one naturally hopes that he can get more fish; thinking for the fish, one hopes that they can escape the terrible net. Isn't this also a contradiction? In fact, worrying about the fish is also superfluous. In the world, there are even more invisible nets! For example, the net of troubles, the net of fame and fortune, the net of lusts, all kinds of nets. It is very rare to not fall into them, or to know to climb out immediately if you fall into them.</p>
<p>After many buildings were destroyed, this city seemed even more寒傖 (shabby). Everyone chooses the shortest route to walk, so the distance is shortened. As for the distance between people, in comparison, not only has it not been shortened, but it is even further. A small city is like a small family, what one comes into contact with all day long are those limited familiar faces. In theory, one should be able to live harmoniously. However, what phenomena do I see? Pascal said: "Man is only a reed, the weakest thing in nature." Now I want to say: If the reeds must collide with each other, apart from breaking immediately and simultaneously, no other miracle will occur. People's fanaticism for wealth and their excessive austerity in life are no longer something I can understand. However, this is also good. Their souls have a home. They will no longer feel the emptiness of life, because wealth has become their new religion, their new God.</p>
<p>In remote places, the enjoyment and authority of a county magistrate makes me think of the ancient emperors. The citizens are afraid of眼泪 (tears), I have not failed to see it, but even more terrifying is the second generation that grows up in this environment. When they go to society in the future, they will definitely not know what is integrity and what is serving the people.</p>
<p>On the eve of my departure, the moonlight was exceptionally beautiful. Was it to give me a send-off party? Or to bless me? When will I return to my hometown to enjoy the moonlight again? It is difficult to predict this in this turbulent era.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 337</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>That report, however, was a great masterpiece by Little Tiger, forwarded by the Tianjin office of the Northeast "Zhai Zi (bandit stronghold)":</p>
<p>"Respectfully submitted as a report; this humble person was separated from the captain in the Tianjin "Three No-Control Zone," venturing east and west, searching everywhere but unable to find him. This humble person is helpless, probing the Japanese dog military headquarters three times, without any results. Originally, this humble person and the captain were supposed to arrive in the Zhang×kou area on August 5th and 6th to meet up with more than 40 members of the Zhai Zi large team, could it be that the captain could not find this humble person and went ahead. This humble person has arrived in 平 (Ping, abbreviated of Beiping), and has no face to meet with the Commander-in-chief, so this person writes a few lines, reporting to you, even if it means going through boiling water and fire, this person will find the captain. This underling Xiao Hucheng stands at attention to report."</p>
<p>This report is not a code; because Little Tiger doesn't understand codes. The wonderful thing is that although it is not a code, it has the meaning of a code. Someone not in the know simply cannot understand it. I carefully reviewed this report and could see that Little Tiger probably spent a lot of effort on this report. Don't look down on his unpleasant writing, Little Tiger may not be able to write this wonderful but unpleasant text. This can be seen from two points: first, this report is not in Little Tiger's own handwriting. Although the handwriting is not good, it is ten times more regular than Little Tiger's "仙人一把抓 (A Sage Grabs a Handful)," futuristic art characters; each stroke, twelve minutes formal. The second point, this bovine-equine hybrid submission format and the paper of the report, are not ordinary letter paper, nor are they official document submission paper, but the状子 (petition) paper that ordinary people use to file lawsuits. In addition, a particularly large red-signed official seal was found. I don't know where it was sought from an antique paper shop dating back to the Kangxi era. This, presumably within the possible secret range, Little Tiger found a person with a little superficial knowledge to act as the sword-holder and temporary secretary, showing this skill.</p>
<p>"Again, I have to trouble you to make a trip," Mr. W said to me with a smile on his face, but with full of worry. The smile was because Mr. W saw me studying Little Tiger's 漯亮 (muddy and bright) report, and guessed all the points of my thinking.</p>
<p>"Going is not a problem; I'm just afraid that like the trip to Tianjin, there will be no results—a trip in vain." When I recalled the tragic death of Mr. Ding and the imprisonment of other comrades, I couldn't do my best, or give my efforts, even by half. "...The destination is of course Wanquan and Zhangbei; this section here, of course, will still use the "Number Fifteen" stance; but after crossing Kou?..." I clarified the route of departure and the problems on the road.</p>
<p>"Yes!" Mr. W turned his wise, worried eyes; "This section is of course most suitable to go out using the "Number Fifteen" type; otherwise, it will be difficult to move an inch... It will be easy again after crossing Kou, and I can arrange it properly for you. The difficulty lies in "how to cross the甫 (just) 口 (mouth, here refers to the pass)..." Mr. W also seemed to have been infected by Tsurumi; putting his hands behind his back, he walked back and forth in the room.</p>
<p>"What stage has the situation at Kou reached?" I had been out of touch with the current affairs intelligence for the last three or four days. Although "〇四" gave me a stack of intelligence copies, I haven't had time to look at them carefully.</p>

<h3>Ding Mocun's Last Words</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>"Number 26" mega-traitor Ding Mocun was executed by firing squad. On his deathbed, he only said one sentence. He said, "I hope the government will be more lenient with traitors." The rebellious Ding did not fully express his opinion and fell in a pool of blood. We don't know how much meaning this sentence contains. If we are only speculating, then Ding Mocun, who killed countless people during the enemy puppet period, seems to have a sense of "injustice not redressed" regarding his death sentence.</p>
<p>Regarding traitors, people in Shanghai seem to be much more indifferent than before. They no longer care much whether they should be punished by law or should be forgiven; but at least, in this chaotic and uneasy psychological state, the dike of personal morality and character has long collapsed, and all the standards for weighing right and wrong in the past have become insignificant here.</p>
<p>And for a "觀　事仇" (watching things as enemies) traitor, or even a vividly countable villain, everyone seems not to be fussy about his past crimes.</p>
<p>— This is really a very terrifying tendency.</p>
<p>Betraying national interests, selling out the country, regardless of the reasons, should be punished. Even if the law one day forgives them, but in terms of private morality, a person without integrity and character should also be given appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why are so many "learned and famous" traitors in history, who defected and humiliated the country, still being laughed at and scolded today?</p>

<h3>The Origin of the Seven-Day Week Naming</h3>
<p>— West Wind</p>
<p>Why is Sunday called Sunday? What are the meanings of the names of the other seven days? I would like to give a simple introduction now:</p>
<p>日曜日 Sunday: Judging from the literal meaning, you will know that it means the day of the sun. The sun gives people light, warmth, vitality, and happiness. The ancients realized the power of the sun from drought and experienced the warmth of the sun in severe cold. The changes of cold and heat, day and night, made them feel the mystery and wonder of the sun even more. They believed that the sun was a god named Apollo, who drove a chariot with burning flames, constantly patrolling in space. They worshipped the sun. In fact, without the sun, there would be no world, no everything. Who would say it is inappropriate to name the first day of the week as the day of the sun?</p>
<p>月曜日 Monday: Originally Moonoday, as the name suggests, it can also be known as the "Day of the Moon". When the golden crow sets in the west and the moon rabbit rises in the east, the silver light pours all over the earth, and all things are comforted by her, and they all feel comfortable, smooth, tranquil, and peaceful. The moon goddess is a slender, gentle, elegant, and beautiful goddess named Diana. She rides in a silver-shimmering chariot, following Apollo around the world. Therefore, the "Day of the Moon" is also named as the second day of the week, following the "Day of the Sun".</p>
<p>火曜日 Tuesday: It means "Tyrs Day". Tyrs is a brave general under the mountain god. In order to conquer the cunning wolf Fenris and make the footsteps of the armored cat, the whiskers of the girl, the peak of the mountain, the whistling of the fish, the longing of the bear, and the saliva of the bird, the mountain god specially made a strange chain. Tyrs used this chain to capture the wolf spirit Fenris, but he also lost an arm as a result. To commemorate his glorious sacrifice, the third day of the week was named "Tyrs Day". In French, it is called Mardi, which commemorates Mars, a war god similar to Tyrs, with the same meaning.</p>
<p>水曜日 Wednesday: It is to commemorate the day of Odin, the first great god on the Scandinavian island. Odin lives in the Weilhalla Palace, which is inlaid with jewelry, gold and silver everywhere, and is magnificent and beautiful. Two crows are always standing on his shoulders. These are "field reporters" who collect news from the lower world for him, and they often send them to invite the warriors who died on the battlefield of Margeri to drink sweet wine leisurely and listen to them report the process of loyalty to the country and heroic sacrifice.</p>
<p>木曜日 Thursday: Is the day of "Thor". Thor is the god of strength in Scandinavia. He wears iron gloves and uses a pair of heavy hammers that no one can use as weapons. One day, the giant Thrym secretly stole it. The shameless bastard claimed that he would marry the goddess Freyja as a condition for returning the heavy hammer. Thor disguised himself as a goddess to ask for it. During the banquet, he ate a strong cow and eight salmon in one breath, which shocked Thrym. Thrym became a ghost under his hammer at this time. Although Thor is so powerful, there are still two things that he politely declines. He couldn't lift a kitten, a cat incarnated from the Midgarda Serpent that entangled the entire earth. He couldn't finish a horn of water, one end of which was connected to the sea. Thursday is "Power Day". This day's work will make you particularly satisfied. In fact, on Monday and Tuesday, people think that the two weeks have just begun, and their scattered hearts have not been recovered. On Friday and Saturday, they think that Sunday is coming, which leads to anxiety. Only on this day, the mood is collected and not released, and the will is concentrated. Naturally, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>金曜日 Friday is "Freyja's Day". She is the beautiful goddess who made Thrym coveted. Her husband, Odin, and her son, Thor, are both famous. Perhaps it is because of her husband's nobility and her son's glory that her fragrant name is named on the sixth day of the week. However, the Westerners all hate this unlucky day because it is the day of Jesus' crucifixion.</p>
<p>木曜日 Saturday is "Saturn's Day", commemorating the Roman agricultural god Saturn. Although he is a licentious, rude, and savage god, and even committed the atrocity of swallowing his own sons, he has made great contributions to mankind. Mankind depends entirely on his gift—grains, vegetables, melons, fruits, and animal husbandry. Therefore, even Saturn is named after him. And to this day, whether it is civil servants, employees, students, military police, or elegant individuals, they are all eagerly looking forward to the arrival of Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<h3>Explanation of "Election"</h3>
<p>— Lu Shi</p>
<p>"Election" has long become a specialized term and is commonly used by Chinese people, but strictly speaking, the connotations of "selection" and "election" are completely different, and they are explained separately as follows.</p>
<p>"Selection" means to pick out a few people from many people, such as in the chapter "Li Yun" in the Book of Documents, "select the virtuous and capable". "Election" means that most people publicly recommend a few people to do things, such as in Han Xiao's "recommend the virtuous and upright".</p>
<p>Originally, there were two election methods. One is voting by all citizens (except for passive restrictions), which is usually called universal suffrage. The other is that the government sets candidates and stipulates that the elected person can only be generated from the list of candidates, which is generally called circle selection. In this way, the term universal suffrage should be revised to "universal election", while circle selection is "selection", because it selects first and then elects.</p>
<p>However, we do not advocate renaming the election in terms of words now, but we want to remind the people that before electing, they should carefully select the person they want to elect, which is the true spirit of democracy. Otherwise, if they are vague and manipulated by others, forming an election without selection, that kind of election is futile!</p>
<h3>Rectification of the Japanese Rectification Work</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>The Japanese government announced on June 27 the detailed measures for the final political purge, including the aspect of speech reporting and the organs for controlling speech. However, it is noteworthy that the English-language Japan Times, which was listed in the list of those subject to inspection and reported in the past, is not included in the purge this time. Some time ago, it was rumored that Foreign Minister Ashida would be purged because he served as the president and editor-in-chief of the newspaper, because the newspaper was subsidized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and often published speeches by warlords. Now it is not included in the purge, so it has aroused the surprise of the Japanese press. In fact, not only Ashida and the former Japan Times were favored under the rectification work. Let's look back at the past rectification, and we can understand it clearly.</p>
<p>Originally, in Japan, in addition to the important war criminals being tried by the Far East International Military Tribunal, the Allied Headquarters, in order to enable Japan to move towards democratization on a new path, first had to liquidate the corrupt elements in the backbone of society. Therefore, it issued an order on executing the purge of those who supported aggression, ordering the Japanese government to organize a Central Rectification Committee to handle the rectification of militarists and problematic people in Japanese politics, education, economy, and enterprises.</p>
<p>In Japanese enterprises, economy, and financial institutions, the top ten financial groups and those financial oligarchs lost their control. Companies with assets of more than one million yen were liquidated, and important officials and employees were purged and prohibited from serving in the purged and companies again.</p>
<p>In education, problematic faculty and staff were expelled from schools. Those professors who published martial ideas had to leave the lecture hall.</p>
<p>In politics, those who were purged included members of parliament and leaders of various local cities and towns before September 2, 1945, and those who held important positions in politics, economy, and propaganda were not allowed to hold official positions in the future.</p>
<p>At first glance, the above-mentioned rectification work seems to be very satisfactory, but it is not so in reality. Many of the members of the Central Rectification Committee themselves were suspected of being purged. During the Shidehara Cabinet, it had been using delaying methods, using financial and economic crises and food shortages and social crises, and investigating wartime activities to deal with the urging of the Allied Headquarters. It also instructed various political, military, financial, and financial institutions to change their appearance or break up into pieces. During that period of delay, secret police and some unknown martial artists had been installed as successors to those who were purged in the local area. Big financial companies were also mostly decentralized or reorganized. A group of pro-government professors still occupied the podium. Cabinet members were temporarily changed and listed for inspection to show leniency. Officials were promoted to important positions in the past. According to reports from American correspondents, former Prime Minister Yoshida not only did not actively prevent untrustworthy politicians from participating in politics, but also encouraged them to work behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Now, the rectification work in Japan is nearing completion, but the past rectification is really unsatisfactory. And in the final rectification that began in the political aspect, the Japan Times, which was once praised as a transmitter of aggression to the outside world, was allowed to go unpunished. At this time, we really request a comprehensive review of the rectification work, and ask the Committee for the Control of Japan and the Allied Headquarters to rectify and inspect the content of the rectification work, so that the purpose of rectification can be thoroughly achieved.</p>
<h3>Miscellany of a Trip to America</h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>Since warships are monsters on the sea, it seems that building ships in coastal shipyards is the right way. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, and said that American warships were built on the top of a mountain, I would definitely be scolded as ignorant. It's really wronged! American warships are indeed built on the top of a mountain. In peacetime, warships were originally built in shipyards on the east and west coasts, but since the outbreak of World War II, the coasts have been deeply threatened by the enemy. Not only are the shipyards likely to be bombed, but the workers are also unwilling to serve. Therefore, the shipbuilding equipment has been completely moved into the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>The Rocky Mountains are located in the central and western parts of the United States, mainly in the state of Colorado. They are one mile above sea level. Therefore, the capital of Colorado, "Denver", has another name, called City of One Mile High. If you ask a Rotary Club member from Colorado, they will definitely know and appreciate this nickname. When I lived in Denver, I was invited by the local "Friends of China Belly" to visit the shipyard in the mountains. The shipyard is located in the mountains, which can be regarded as an unprecedented wonder. We have never heard of China building a navy in Dongting Lake. It doesn't seem to be very worthy of the name, because those who make a living in the lake have never been called "military". But those who make a living in the Rocky Mountains are real navies. We set off from Denver by car, and the car drove for two hours before arriving at the shipyard. Although we couldn't see the entire ship, we were building various parts of the warship, and there were also parts as big as small bungalows. After they were built, they were transferred by car to the railway line, loaded on trains, and transported to the west coast, such as Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. It took a week or two to assemble tens of thousands of scattered parts into warships weighing tens of thousands of tons.</p>
<p>I am not the only Chinese person who visited the shipyard in the mountains. At that time, because the Pacific War was in full swing, there was no mention of it in the newspaper. The coastal areas of China are not without threats. If we really want to build a navy, we should build several shipyards in the mountains of Guizhou or Xikang, so as to avoid the threat of air surveillance to the coast. There will be no time to build ships. (13)</p>
<h3>A Distant Relative of Mankind</h3>
<p>— Chang Shu</p>
<p>In terms of evolution, the entire animal kingdom is a big family. Taking humans as an individual, apes and monkeys are distant relatives of humans, with the same bloodline. So when you go to the zoo and see short monkeys jumping around, with yellow fur all over their bodies, and dragging a tail, you may think they are ugly and difficult to look at. You don't dare to think of them as the same kind, but this is not someone else, it is your distant relative. When you were in your mother's womb for the sixth month, not only did you look the same as them, but you also went through the same life as them for a short period of time.</p>
<p>There is a kind of large monkey in Africa that has beautiful golden hair and a large vermilion nose with bright green, grooved cheeks. It is the most peculiar and beautiful member of the baboon family, and it is also the most beautiful animal. This kind of large monkey loves to live in groups. If they get separated, they will not hesitate to travel long distances to find the whereabouts of their own kind.</p>
<p>In the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, there is a huge male monkey, or called Papi, which habitually knocks on the floor with a drinking cup to win the praise of its kind.</p>
<p>In the Washington National Zoo, there is a young large monkey whose intelligence is as beautiful as the color on its face. It will make all kinds of funny moves to please people. He lies on a poplar tree with his hands outstretched, passing a grass back and forth in his hands. The audience stands in front of him, waving a stick to attract attention. If you throw something at him, he will catch it one by one. It can break branches, hold an umbrella, and perform various poses in the cage, imitating people, often for an hour without getting tired.</p>
<p>In addition to these ways of playing, no matter how well-educated it is after being imprisoned, it still retains the ferocity it had in Africa. It has a hostile temperament towards enemies, strong teeth, and sharp claws. The aborigines of West Africa are very afraid of the group attacks of this kind of large monkey, and they also have some fear when it comes to these animals. Mask makers want to imitate the appearance of large monkeys to make horror masks, and that is the reason.</p>
<h3>An Exploration of the Pipa Record</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>Among the Yuan Dynasty operas that are popular today, the Pipa Record and the Romance of the West Chamber are the most prominent, and the lyrics and music of the Romance of the West Chamber are especially popular. This is because its content is mostly stories of talented scholars and beautiful women, which are easy to please young people. However, the Pipa Record is not the case. The whole book contains mostly trivial matters of loyal ministers, filial sons, virtuous women, and righteous husbands. Old people read it, or because it is related to the world, they can't bear to discard it. Young people read it, I'm afraid their ears will ring and their eyes will be dizzy, and they will fall asleep. However, in terms of its lyrics and music, it seems to be even better than the Romance of the West Chamber. It's just that the reader's intention is not here. According to what is recorded in He Yuanlang's "Discussion on Music" in the Ming Dynasty, when Gao Zecheng wrote this record, he had another meaning. At that time, there was a man named Wang Si who was friendly with Gao. Gao advised Wang to become an official. Wang passed the imperial examination, and then abandoned his wife and became attached to the family of the Taishi Bu Hua. Gao was deeply disgusted with it, so he wrote the Pipa Record to satirize Wang. The name Pipa was taken because the four kings on his head were a hidden reference to Wang Si. The Yuan people called cattle "Bu Hua", and the prime minister Niu in the book is Taishi Bu Hua. As for borrowing the great sage Cai Bojie as the protagonist in the book, it was caused by You's poem. You's "Bamboo Branch Temple" says: "The setting sun obliquely strikes the Zhao Family Village, the clapperboard teacher is performing, whether behind his back is right or wrong, the whole village is full of middle-aged gentlemen". Later, when the Ming Dynasty destroyed the Yuan Dynasty, they obtained the Pipa Record and loved it. Because he asked Zecheng the purpose of the book, he abandoned it with a dangerous attitude. The emperor was furious and executed Wang Si in the wilderness. The ancients' word for the cut was similar to an axe and an axe.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Merkenney</h3>
<p>— Kui Sheng</p>
<p>The newspaper reported: "New York, 24th Broadcast, Mr. Meknei, Professor of Far Eastern History at the University of Chicago, died of a heart attack at the age of fifty-five." According to Mei, he was an expert in political science and history. His original name was H. McNair. He graduated from the University of California and was a disciple of the American political science authority Prof. Sait. Mei's Chinese translation should be Mi Henry (translated by others), and he taught at Yueda for more than ten years as the author's teacher. Mr. Mi and Professor Remer were both famous professors in the Department of Political Economy at Yueda and were very diligent in their studies. As for his academic approach, he studied politics in a historical and coherent way, and he was particularly knowledgeable about international and Far Eastern issues, which was the same as Mr. Liang Qichao from Xinhui. He was eloquent and his words were elegant. Thousands of years up and down were like threading beads. His vast knowledge is rare among domestic scholars. His research method focuses on Original Research, makes good use of Index Method, and transfers less textbook-like concrete writings. I remember when I was at the University of Yue, I wrote books late into the night, burning the midnight oil and forgetting to eat. Once the conversation started, he spoke fluently. He lived with his mother, and he was filial to her, and his actions were very oriental. Thinking of the teacher's door, it seems like yesterday, which makes people feel the sense of Liangmu.</p>
<h3>Religion and Morality</h3>
<p>— Little Boy</p>
<p>W. Bello said: "Religion is the foundation of private morality and public trust, and it is also the foundation of personal happiness and national prosperity." G. Sperling also said: "There is no morality without religion." It seems that all countries in the world have religious elements. Most societies are evolving in a religious atmosphere, and human morality is changing in this environment. There are many religious sects from ancient times to the present. The most common are Christianity, Catholicism, Islam, and Buddhism, etc., and the doctrines are also different. Buddhism takes compassion as its main principle, Islam emphasizes self-cultivation, Catholicism regards piety as sacred, and Christianity practices universal love. However, there is only one true religion, just like personal belief, it cannot be multifaceted. The true religion is the religion that is in line with justice. Nothing can oppose it. Because human beings have different religious beliefs, and even some people have no religious beliefs, there is a lack of a common religious belief to promote private morality and no connection of public trust in the soul between people. Because of this, there is a deep separation between people with different beliefs, which inevitably leads to mutual jealousy, suspicion, infighting, damage, and other situations that harm morality. If this continues for a long time, how can personal morality not fall behind? How can a happy state of mind be cultivated in the heart of a person who lacks private morality? How can a country where people's beliefs are inconsistent and morality is low prosper?</p>
<p>Let's look at what Tolstoy said:</p>
<p>"Excellent people are the key to national prosperity, and religious belief is the only element that cultivates people to have good virtues."</p>
