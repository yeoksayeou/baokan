<h3>曾琦發表談話　論中蘇僵局　主張由兩國直接談判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕十四日中蘇友好條約簽訂兩週年，靑年黨主席曾琦發表談話云：「談到中蘇邦交，吾人有不能忘及不可忽者五點；（一）蘇聯於一九一七年革命後，曾經宣布放葉帝俄時代對華之一切權利，而中蘇友好條約則適與之相反，在中國方面，因增進邦交，不惜支付重大代價，而在蘇聯方面，乃蓋於未得中國同意之雅爾達密約，在實質上及形式上均有恢復帝俄時代一切權利之意味。（二）關於中東鐵路蘇聯前後有三次矛盾之措置，最初依其革命實言交還中國，其後於中日戰時擅自售與中國之敵人日本，最後又要求中蘇共管。（三）中蘇絛約換文及關於大連之協定，蘇聯政府會聲明保證中國管轄東三省全部主權，視其爲「中國之一不可分離部份」，而訂約兩年，旅大迄未交遺，其間且有反乎友好之行動，如一，運走工業機器，二，以日本武器裝備中共軍隊，三，編組韓共日俘，協助中共攻擊國軍等事，不知將置中國主權於何地。（四）關於新疆問題，蘇聯亦曾於條約換文內聲明不干涉中國內政，而今則柴使外蒙侵略新疆，已爲公開之秘密。（五）條約內明定雙方同意開放大　爲自中港，而今則中國且不能進入大速市，更何諭英·美各友邦。旅大已成蘇聯鐵幕之一，殊爲遠東和平一大威脅。余以爲中蘇邦交長此僵持，實非世界和平之福，解決之道，不外三途，（一）由中硃兩國外交當局直接談判，澈底檢討條約朱克實行責任究在何方，必要時即另訂新約，由三十年延長至五十年亦無不可，中國永無侵蘇之意，當爲世人所共信。（二）由英·美出而調解，以五國外長會議折衷之。（三）由聯合國安理會仲裁之。三者仍以先由第一途徑爲佳，因吾人極盼中蘇兩國能自動和好有半世紀相安，無勞第三者作調人，如第一途徑走不通，則二·三兩途徑亦可選擇。總之，偃局必求打破，萬不可任其遷延，以釀不測之禍。</p>

<h3>張君勱抵牯談話　魏使此來有關安定民生　選舉問題主張政黨提名</h3>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十三日電〕張君勱十三日下午八時四十分抵牯，同來者有外籍女秘書麥蘿娜小姐等，下榻張嘉璈公館。張係十二日農過京西上，十三日下午五時抵潯旋即登廬山·本報記者當晚訪晤張氏，詢以美在滬與魏德邁會談時所提之意見。張對此避不答覆，惟稱：魏氏此來對我國有甚大帮助。至美將如何援助，胥視魏此次調查結果而定。張氏稱：魏氏談話時，曾表示其最友誼態度，希望我國政治走上民主之路，並希望我國人民生活得以安定。張氏相信魏氏此來將與國人生活安定一點，有重大關係，而人民生活能否安定，則以政洽是否修明爲先決條件。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺十三日電〕張君勱十三晚接見本報記者時，暢談民社黨最近之糾紛。渠指出三點：（一）若干人謂渠獨裁，則不然。渠事事均公開。（二）海外黨員大部對渠擁護，彼等支持民社無問題。（三）伍憲子脫離民社黨後，彼之府委遺缺，政府當已有考慮，惟民社黨不擬補推繼任人選。張談話時指摘李大明等之不明國情，如希望渠任行政院長，民肚黨應有四府委，二部長，一政委等，實則渠本人絕不能任行政院長。張對民社糾紛事表示樂觀，認爲海外代表曾參加最近舉行之全代大會，故民憲脫黨事並不嚴重。關於選舉問題，渠主張政黨提名辦法。據稱，今秋大選，國民黨希望各黨各派人士均參加，但各黨各派之實力難與國民黨競爭。政黨提名辦法，係對候選人作比例之規定，而非對選舉結果作比例之規定。最後決定權仍操之選舉人。民社黨員參加選舉，將由黨控制，民社巾央黨部已設選舉總事務所主持其事。</p>

<h3>外商來華投資問題　董局長發表張院長聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕政院新聞局董顯光局長，十三日於記者招待會席間，發表行政院張院長關於外商來華投資工業間題之聲明如下：</p>
<p>中國政府對於外人來華投資及技術合作問題，曾由前國防最高委員會在戰後第一期經濟建設原則中明文規定，並經頒布中國法律如公司法，礦業法等，對於外國公司，中外合股公司以及參加股本，取得礦權等，均有明文規定，現在商訂中之中外商約中，亦有相關之規定。中國政府爲使利外商明瞭中國政府所持之政策起見，特再分項說明如下：</p>
<p>關於外商司以直接投資之工業範圍</p>
<p>本問題所稱「直接投資」，解釋作爲外商以外國人或外國法人等名義來華投資，單獨經營於製造工業而言，各項工業，除本聲明第二簡所指明應由國營者及中國法律規定應由中國人或中國法人經營者外，可由外商直接投資，例如大型動力機，工具機，汽車，機車，飛機及較大輪船等項之製造業，尤所歡迎。</p>
<p>（二）關於中國政府規定之國營工業範園。</p>
<p>中國政府保留完全國營之工業，依照第一期經濟建設原則第二條乙項規定，政府獨營事業種類，不擬過多，包括兵工廠，錢幣廠，主要鐵路，大規模水力發電廠等。</p>
<p>後據礦業法第九、第十兩條所定之各項礦產，應歸國營，但此類國營礦集，依怯仍司與人民或外人合資經營，或租貸民營。</p>
<p>（三）關於可以容許國營及民營同時經營及官商合辦之工業範圍及所享受之待遇。</p>
<p>關於此一問題，第一期經營建設原則第二條已有具體規定，茲摘錄有關各項如次：（子）未經指定政府獨營之事業（除有法律限制者外），均可由人民經營，（丑）凡民力有所不勝，或政府認爲須特別重視之事業，如大規模石油礦，鋼鐵廠及航運事業等，政府仍得單獨經營，或與民資外資合營，（寅）政府與民資外資合辦之事業，應採公司制度，政府除依法行使行政監督　外，對於公司業務及人事之管理　，應以股東地位行使之。（卯）政府所經營之事業，除政府獨營者外，無謂單獨經營或與民資外資合辦，其具有商業性質者，均與同類民營事業之權利義務同一待遇。</p>
<p>中國政府對於外商與中國人民合資舉辦工業，尤表歡迎。此外，對於分配及結購外匯，原料分配，貸款及輸入許可限額等，依照現行外匯管理辦法及卅五年頒布之「修正進出口貿易暫行辦法」之規定。國營事業與民營事業一律辦理，並不得享受優越權利。</p>
<p>（四）關於不准外國公司經營之工業範閱。</p>
<p>依照中國公司法第二百九十三條第一項第二款之規定，外國公司營業地區及營業種類可加以限制。</p>
<p>（五）關於怯令與稅則。</p>
<p>中國所定稅法，規定外商在伙國境內營業，其應課徵之稅額，與本國人民同，自不致阻碍工業合理利潤之獲得。</p>
<p>（六）關於投資所得利潤，可否匯回外國，及所需之物資及義務，必須自外國輸入者，是否准予結購外匯。</p>
<p>外商在華投資於工業所得利潤，原則上可以匯回外國，在中國現在管理外匯期間，當然受有限期，惟政府現正訂定辦法，准許外商投資於工業所得利潤之適當部份匯回本國，至於業務所需之物資及勞務，須自外國輸入者，在管理外匯期間，當然依照「修正進出口貿易暫行辦怯」審查許可。</p>
<p>（七）關於地方政府頒布有關外商經營事業之怯規問題。</p>
<p>現行各項重要地方法規之頒布，均經中央政府核准，自不致違背中國政府歡迎外資之政策，妨碍商人根據健全方針經營其業務。</p>
<p>〔合衆社本市訊〕此間外國商人對於張院長呼籲外人投炎中國，極感興味。但稱：渠等以前亦曾聽到同樣辦怯，現暫保留評論，「以待此事之實現」。某一重要外國人稱：建設重工業，如輪船，機車，汽車及機械工具之製造等，可能解決中國之經濟問題，但此事頗爲困難，目前之通貨膨脹、，幾使此事難以即刻進行，雖則此種工業可以阻止通貨脹膨，然目前之通貨膨脹、貨足以阻碍此項工業　　　出現之機會。</p>

<h3>戰前各項外債　政府決續償付　董局長說明我維持債信誠意</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕記者以中國政府對於戰前各項外債自一九三九年停付後，迄未恢復償付，提詢政府對此問題究將如何處理，董局長本日答復如下：</p>
<p>中國政府對於中日戰爭期間停會之各項外債，鄭重表示其恢復償付之決心。至近年先後所舉各項新債並不妨碍戰前各債之担保品或損害各該持券人之權益。同時，中國政府希望一本維持債信之政策，不久即可逐步整理舊債</p>
<p>溯憶戰前數年，中國政府曾經解決前北京政府所遺舊欠懸案甚多，就整理外債方面而言，有顯著之進步，不幸此種堅苦之努力，盡爲日敵侵略所摧毀。</p>
<p>此次戰爭初起之一年半中，雖供外債担保之關，　兩稅深受戰爭之阻撓，然中國政府對其債務仍繼續維持，如期如數償付本息，當此民族之空前危機中，此種成就，似足表示中國竭力維持債信之誠意。</p>
<p>迨一九三九年春，中國之主要稅收幾乎全部爲敵刦持，中國政府迫不得已，乃將各項債款暫行停付，各國債權人對此項措施均能同情諒解，中國政府實深感謝</p>
<p>此次世界即侵略大戰中國抗戰最久，損失最重，現在戰爭雖已結束，然中國經濟與財政復員工作僅方開始，而戰後建設需款迫切，構成當前財政上之艱鉅負担，尤以外匯方面爲然。另一方面，全國工商交通各業以及稅務行政，又需相當時日方可恢復正常，今日之中國中，正如戰後其他多數國家仍須依賴國際間之經濟援助，發展工商業，以培植償債能力。</p>
<p>雖如是，中國政府深具決心，盡其最大努力，以履其償債義務，並誠心願望財政狀况能儘速改進，以便戰前各債得以早日恢復償付。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十三日電〕據非官方估計，中國戰前外債共計約有五億美元，五千一百萬英鎊，一億三千八百萬法郎，五千三百萬比利時法郎及荷幣三千萬盾。一九三九年春季，償還工作因戰事而告停頓。</p>
<h3>共匪五次作亂結果　東北損失驚人　達流通券萬四千餘億</h3>

<h3>爭取外交的主動　——中蘇締約二周年感言</h3>
<p>中蘇友好條約的簽訂，到如今兩年了。這一條約的簽訂，在中國人民心理中，總不免蒙上一層沉　的陰影。在抗戰初期，我們感謝我們北疆偉大隣邦的援助；初不料在我們歷史的鬥爭勝利未遂之際，而有這樣友好條約的簽訂。正爲了友好，中國人民懷着壯士斷臂的心情，對於這一條約的簽訂，不但沒有怨言和憤恨，反而寄以殷切的期望。他們希望由於此一條約的簽訂，中蘇關係，必能展開新頁。然而這兩年來的發展，非但未能如中國人民之所期，抑且使他們對於將來不免多少懷有一種幻滅的感覺。今日當中蘇友好條約簽訂的兩周年，中國人民誰都不免有一種沉重的心情。</p>
<p>自從十月革命以來，中國人民對於北疆的隣邦，無不寄予殷切的關注和真誠的期望。在中國的國民革命運動中，他們首先看見列寗將沙皇時代在中國所獲得的特權宣告廢止。自動放棄在華的種種特權。不用說，這在中國人民的心理中曾引起良好的印象。其後國民革命運動在珠江流域展開，蘇聯又曾予以道義上的支持，此後雖有共匪存在的關係，但中國人民却以共匪爲一內部問題，始終不願牽涉到對蘇關係上去。抗戰初期，蘇聯政府對我的支持，更證明了中國人民所懷抱的見解，並沒有錯誤。中蘇地壤相接，其間國界的綿長，世無其匹。中國人民所期望的便是能够對我們的北隣平安相處，益臻親睦。這是在這種情緒下，我們看見有中蘇友好條約的簽訂。</p>
<p>不幸的是這兩年來中蘇關係的發展太使我們扼腕了。對日的作戰已停止了兩年，而我們整個在東北的主權，到如今還沒有全部收復。旅順大連依據前項條約雖將特殊化，但條約所規定的特殊化局面到如今還沒有產生，對日戰爭停止已兩年了，而中國派往大連的官員至今還未能赴任。至於工礦設備的被剝奪，日俘的遺留不散，朝鮮人民的武裝移入　以及共匪的盤據，此在公正的記者原早有客觀而詳盡的報道。我們當時以壯士斷臂的心情捨棄了外蒙，原期東北的局勢可趨單純；怎奈兩年來的發展，大有背於我們期望！而且更使我們扼腕的不但是東北如此，新疆西北又復多事。外蒙的人侵新疆，其中有蘇聯飛機的公然參加作戰，蘇聯並且又支持外蒙對中蒙疆界的捏造證據。是則兩年以來，我們因此項友好條約的簽訂，已表示了我們最大的友好；而蘇聯的行徑，顯與友好之旨未合。茲當中蘇友好條約簽訂的兩周年，對於此後的中蘇關係加以展望，有不能不言來一吐我們沉重的心情者，約如下列：</p>
<p>第一，兩年來局勢的發展，不但足以明示蘇聯沒有履行前項條約義務的誠意，抑且一方面支持外蒙向我疆土的入侵，同時又予我國的共匪以奧援，是其行徑，實已顯不友好。在此情勢之下，我們與蘇聯的片面交涉，似已無多大意。又當此時會，我們亟應採取外交主動，將兩年來中蘇關係發展的過程，公諸天下，至少使世界的輿論及今後的史家，能够看到此一事態發展的全貌，而有一種公論。此外，國際間的爭執，如關於條約解釋的爭執，原有國際法所公認的和平解決辦法。倘使關於條約的解釋，中蘇意見未能一致，以致我國在東北的主權，迄未全部收復，我們儘可訴諸常設的國際機構，聽其公正的裁判。在此風雨如晦，外交局面極度暗　之際；我們的努力，尤應集中在撥開陰霾，使此後的局勢，益趨明朗。</p>
<p>第二，我們要指出的是：中蘇關係之發展到現階段，主要是由於我們承襲了一份沒有意志可表示的遺產。雅爾達是國際政治上的一種大冒險；也可以說是一種大賭博。不幸的是故羅斯福總統在對日作戰還不曾完了之際，在蘇聯還不曾參加對日作戰的時候就與世長辭了。由於此一「旣成事實」，我們看見有中蘇友好條約的簽訂。這兩年來中蘇關係的發展，我們飲水思源，不得不想到雅爾達。羅斯福總統雖則已經作了古人，但美國對於今後國際政治所負的責任，特別是在遠東，卻不因總統的謝世而消逝；相反地，它卻擔負起了更重大的道義責任。中蘇關係的將來如何發展，像在過去一樣，多少被決定於蘇美關係的如何發展。只有在此更大的角度下，我們纔能正視中蘇關係的推移。</p>
<p>不用說，我們是一向珍視蘇聯的睦誼的；雖然現階段的中蘇關係未如理想，我們總期中蘇兩大隣邦，能够日趨友好。我們旣沒有反蘇的情緒，更不希望美蘇關係的惡化，但願他們能够恢復像在戰時那樣的和諧，使戰後世界的局勢能够日趨安定。當茲由蘇友好條約簽訂兩周年的今日，環顧國內外的局勢，誠不免令我們感觸多端；盡其在我，更當於此際爭取我們外交的主動；庶幾今後的外交局面能够日趨明朗！</p>

<p>〔路透社成功　十二日電〕美國今日在安理會中率直聲明，如果在巴爾幹之行動爲否決權所破壞，則美國　備採取獨立措施以維護和平。美代表詹森今日以最激列之演辭，指責共黨為希臘動亂之貨責者，復直指希臘之北鄰爲侵略者。渠聲明「美政府刻已準備會同其他任何聯合國會員國採取措施，以助希臘維護其獨立。聯合國機構內就巴爾幹問題造成之完全僵局，已無成立妥協解決辦法之希望，今已不必再事低首於否決權之威脅，目前已至記錄我方誠實意見之時。美國相信希臘業已受到南保阿三國支持下之遊擊部隊以及希臘共黨之嚴重威脅，後者之目標在建立聽命於共黨控制國家之極權政府。美國決不坐視希臘領土之完整及國家之獨立遭遇一再的挑釁，吾人不認吾人在聯合國機構內之義務，僅因吾人之目標被否決權所破壞而宣告結束。此次否決權之運用，顯然在袒護南保阿三國之侵略，吾人願意明白宣示吾人之決不躊躇，盡力使用憲章範圍內之每一可能的方法，以維持國際和平，並給予希臘以需要的保障。美政府認爲安理會由於蘇聯之使用否決權，而不獲採取有效行動，並不能排除他國採取個別或集體行動，祗要此種行動能邀從聯合國之一般目標與原則。就蘇聯之以否決權阻撓安理會之行動言，吾人確信聯合國全體大會仍得儘量運用其權力以保障希臘。美國準備執行大會爲解決此一問題所提出之任何建議，美國亦準備與具有同一志願之聯合國會員國從事合作，在聯大建議案或憲章之範圍內，採取任何必要步驟，給予希臘以根據憲韋應行享受之保障」。詹森所指者係憲章第五十一條。美代表並提出決議案，要求安理會查明南保阿三國確有支援希臘遊擊隊之行爲，因此構成憲軍第七章內所述對於和平之威脅。決議案復要求三國停止援助希遊擊隊，並令聯合國巴爾幹委員會密切注意事態之發展。理事會旋宣布延至週四繼續辯論。</p>
<h3>希臘遊擊戰　進入新階段</h3>
<p>〔路透社希臘北部珍尼那十二日電〕希臘之遊擊戰，似已進入新階段，受鄰國庇護及供應之叛軍，已逐漸增加其侵入希境騷擾之行動。最近遊擊隊二千名自阿爾巴尼亞侵入園攻柯尼察城可造成之驚駭狀况雖已漸趨消失，然觀察家僉認今後在希臘北疆六百哩之邊界上，將不時有此等事件發生。外來遊擊隊增加之原因之一，或係由於希望陸軍經過四個月之淸剿，業已將大部份之遊擊隊逐至國外，希政府前此所稱侵入部隊內有國際旅團之說刻猶不能證實。</p>

<h3>艾德禮經濟緊急法案　英上院已予通過　該案即將呈請國王簽署</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十三日電〕英國上院十三日批准艾德體首相之經濟緊急法案，將對工業及勞工之「獨裁」權賦予政府。該案業經下院通過，該案雖畀予政府爲全國之利益計可命令勞工及工業界做任何事情，但在上院中遭遇甚小之反對，卒告通過。周時下院反對艾登要求國會縮短假期，俾可檢騐政府根據緊急法案所頒佈之命令。渠稱：美國對英借款將在十月二十日下院重開會議以前消耗殆盡。艾登無正式提議下院在九月十二日開會。</p>

<h3>印尼參加會議　印尼參加會議</h3>
<p>荷方力謀阻撓卒告失敗</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十二日電〕安理會今晚討論印尼問題，不顧英，美，比三國反對，決請印尼代表參加會議。表決票數爲人對三，荷蘭雖領導反對，但非理事國，無表決權。其時印尼前總理沙利坐於旁聽席，立即被邀至會議桌，該國外長薩林隨之列席。此次表決者爲手續問題而非實質問題，故英法所投反對票，照章不作行使否權論。荷代幾克里芬斯隨即要求理事會亦應准許東印尼及婆羅洲代表陳述意見。理事會旋宣告休會至星期日下午，聽取沙利發表意見。</p>
<h3>美將以鉅款貸日　總額約五億大體已決定　傳美尙擬再貸六億以金銀担保</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕據悉，日本向美國借款四億至五億元之交涉，已近完成。借款中之三億元，將用於協助日本購買原料及其他爲製造轍出品時所需之工業必需品，此項借款將用作循環基金，由其中支付原料及機器等必需入口品之價款，而由此種原料所製之貨物之利潤，仍置諸基金中。關於生棉之購入，將由北美棉花公司貸款供應，於六個月中以製成貨品償付。此項貸款，約爲一使五千萬元。聞美國方面尚有意貸與日本六億美元，而以日本銀行中所存之金銀爲擔保品，惟日本方面因工廠能力之限制，及燃料之缺乏，無法利用如許貸款。自投降以來，日本銀行中所存金銀之價値，約爲二億五千萬元，惟盟軍總部於佔領之初會宣佈其中價値四三·五一七•六〇○元之金銀爲泰國所有，三七·〇二三·六三〇元爲越南所有</p>
<h3>存金一部應屬我國</h3>
<p>又價値三一四·五七二元之銀塊及六八〇·〇一五元之金塊爲中國僞聯合準備銀行所有，因之其中之八千萬元之金銀，須分別歸還泰國，越南及中國，餘者價値約爲二億元，美國原擬作爲賠償品，因之目前美國貸款日本之舉，實際係自行犧牲大量賠償而並給與三倍此數之貸款。又美國之貸款僅能用於購買出口品製造原料及其他必需物品，不能用之於國內復興工作。</p>

<h3>英美專家在華府開會　檢討魯爾區煤斤增產　此舉對馬卿計劃有重大關係</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕英美官員今日在此舉行魯爾煤斤增產會議，雙方威認會議結果對於馬歇爾計劃之成收具有重大關係。歐洲復興依賴魯爾煤產供給者共有七國之多，其重要性與糧食不相上下。此次會議將擬定一種詳細辦法，俾將魯爾煤產逐步增加。美國政府將現在日出廿二萬噸之產量，於十二月間增至三十萬噸左右，此後再增至三十五萬噸。英國態度則以爲煤產增加須視其他基本問題，如財政，糧食及運輸等問題之解決爲轉移，美國務部對此則不願討論。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕英美兩國魯爾煤斤增產會議會議今日進入第二日，雙方代表正設法解決德國西部運輸問題，俾將魯爾區產煤搬往德國及其他鄰國工廠應用。由於鐵路車輛與機車奇缺，目前礦穴附近堆積煤斤達數百萬噸之巨。</p>

<h3>禁舞影響稅收　應予逐步淘汰　吳局長返滬前在京談話</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕滬社會局長吳開先來京後，曾謁社會部谷部長等，商上海禁舞問題及接治辦理上海選舉事。茲已公畢，定十三日晚車返滬。據吳局長語記者：吳市長上次來京謁主席時，曾談及禁舞事。市長曾縷述此事對號市財政收入之影響。吳局長認爲取締跳舞，應先限制舞廳之設立，從高征稅，使舞廳逐漸淘汰，而不能於短時期內全部將其禁絕。另據滬市某重要官員談，滬市賴跳舞爲生者極衆，同時中外人士以此爲正當消遣者亦不少，設全部禁絕，不特影響繁榮，且關係治安。實行節約禁舞，亦當逐步爲之。</p>
<h3>解僱金問題　評斷會開小組會議　勞資雙方爭辯劇烈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市勞資雙方，爲無定期契約工人解僱金問題，爭執不已。勞資評斷會七人小組會，昨又在社會局集會討論，由李劍華主席，席間勞資雙方各委員爭辯甚力，資方代表要求廢止評斷會之辦法，認爲依法無據，應完全依照工廠法辦埋。勞方代表則認爲工廠法頒訂已久，不合實際情形，故已要求中央修正。該項工廠法係於戰前承平時訂定，解僱後再覓工作較爲容易。故解僱金之發給較少，現今工商凋敝，如工人一旦失業，欲求再得工作，頗爲不易，且解僱金之發給，即係供過渡時期勉强維特生活之用，勞資評斷會之規定解僱金，至少月半，最多三月，係根據實情訂定，且呈准社會部備案施行，故不容變更。雙方爭執不下，小組會乃決定將勞資雙方之意見，一併呈報社會部，聽由社會部決定。</p>

<h3>引渡美兵對質　却利詳供經過　根據法院騐屍吉果　馬萊開槍可能較多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英人却利與美軍伍長馬萊共謀殺害黑市金鈔掮客余盛孝一案，連日復經中美營憲方面數度偵訊，及將余盛孝之屍體加以檢騐後，頗多新綫索發現。</p>
<p>自却利由美國憲兵總部刑事稽查處提往作證後，警局方面繼亦引渡馬萊到局，與却利對質。雙方仍多互相推諉。惟觀乎各種徵象，則馬萊殺人嫌疑較爲明顯。</p>
<p>却利在此次偵訊時，其供詞較前爲詳盡。謂渠駕車經虹橋俱樂部時，忽聞馬萊高聲威嚇，同時並力捉余盛孝命其「躺下」，余當時尚圖掙扎，致遭槍柄猛擊，繼之馬萊即順手開槍一響。當渠聞聲時，曾因此而將車速减低，但馬萊繼續命其前進，並告以遇有支路時即行駛入。</p>
<p>棄屍林間</p>
<p>迨駛至靑滬邊界時，以路旁有樹林，馬萊即命其停車，然後見馬萊開啓車門，將受傷之余盛孝拖出車外，因此在其皮鞋上染有泥土，褲襪上沾有血跡。事後，馬萊猶命其駕車前進。此時馬萊於車廂中拾獲余盛孝生前縛於手臂上作爲楷汗用之毛巾一條，即以之用作揩刷車中血跡。車行少頃。馬萊復命其掉頭東駛，當回車經過行兇地點後，馬萊始將染有血跡之毛巾拋出車外。進入市區後，首先至渠之寓所略作休息，旋復駕車外出當時意圖先出售金條一根，以備兩人化用，但以時間過晚，雖到處兜售，卒難脫手，後始駕車至匯中飯店。</p>
<p>檢獲彈頭</p>
<p>途中馬萊會在車廂前座之底板上，檢獲彈頭一枚，且曾揚手向渠曰：「你看見嗎？」隨手即納入袋中。</p>
<p>却利對手槍中無彈夾一事，又作補充稱：當馬萊槍殺余盛孝之後，在渠偶然回顧之際，曾目睹馬萊將一極似彈夾之物擲出車外　但馬萊在警局之供詞，則堅稱余盛孝之被槍殺，係却利執槍自前座回身將其擊斃，然後命渠開啓車門，拋出車外。至金條五根，係却利先命其置放前座空位上，候其俯身之際，始乘機下此毒手。當時渠因槍在却利之手，故一切祗好聽其命令也。</p>
<p>受傷部位</p>
<p>以上兩人之供詞，據警局方面再根據法院之騐屍檢定結果，其槍彈係由背後偏左第八肋骨處射入，自前胸偏右第三肋骨穿出，其勢係由下而上，故以情理度之，咸認爲馬萊開槍可能性較大。</p>
<p>前文所述毛巾一點，實爲破獲此案之重要關鍵。蓋警局於出事地點調查時，曾首先檢獲此一條染有血跡之毛巾，至日後與馬萊褲襪上之血跡對照後，始發現爲同一血型，而斷定馬萊實爲同謀殺人之兇犯。</p>
<h3>美軍代表詢問　檢驗屍體情形</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕昨晨九時許，駐華美國陸軍總部刑事稽查處代表　克斯，偕同隨員一人，前往地檢處法醫室，詢問余盛孝屍體檢騐情形，並由隨員將上衣脫去，由法醫王思儉在其身上用墨筆貴出創口式樣，當塲表演，攝成影片帶回，以備刑事稽查處開庭偵查馬萊時作爲參考。事後記者走訪王法醫，承告稱：余盛孝之傷共有三處，一在頭頂，係以鐵器擊傷，頭皮破裂，流血頗多，但頭骨未碎。一在左手第四指與中指之間，有破裂口，後腦部亦傷及表皮，染有血跡，似以手抱頭，力圖抗拒者。其致命創傷，在一彈由背後偏左第八肋骨處射入，從前胸偏右第三肋骨穿出，由下而上斜出，傷及心肺，此實爲余盛孝致死之原因。</p>
<h3>美人萬里贈金　惠及白骨　請購塲地厝葬積柩</h3>

<h3>訪問獨臂將軍石邦藩　四代從軍父祖殉國</h3>
<p>原子彈時代立體戰爭，空軍的威力，最爲顯著。當此勝利後第二年的空軍節，國人對於空軍的演進，以及空軍對於國防的重要，莫不寄與無上的期待</p>
<p>在一個凉風習習的晚上，走訪獨臂將軍石却　上校，他回憶着過去空軍的戰績，感　萬端。我執着筆，聽他說得眉飛色舞，可歌可泣。</p>
<p>千古遺恨無上光榮</p>
<p>石將軍是空軍老前輩，一二八之役，任杭州算橋敎練，幼稚的空軍，爲了應付敵機，他曾隻機升空迎戰，在絕對不利形勢下，擊落敵機兩架，左臂中彈戳去，留下了千古遺恨，無上光榮。</p>
<p>說也可憐，我國空軍，在八一三抗戰前三月，方初具規模，各式各樣不同的戰鬥機，還是「戲機祝壽」民衆捐獻，上海市民貢獻最多。十年前的今日，他在南京任空軍上校參謀長，飛虎將軍陳納德任上校總顧問，協助正副總指揮周至柔，毛邦初，計劃出動轟炸出　艦。</p>
<p>懷念烈士愴然淚下</p>
<p>敵人估計我方僅有好克式轟炸驅逐兩用機，飛行速率不高，調九六式超空機，於九一八之晚，闖入京市，他與高志航事先早將各機油筒，彈架卸下，負荷旣輕，　　倍增，交綏結果，殺得敵機七零八落，大敗逃竄。</p>
<p>最使他傷心的，幾位傑出的高足，如高志航在河南周家口殉國，樂以琴•黃正裕·張祺•楊季豪也先後成仁，沈崇誨在夜襲吳淞中彈，俯衝敵艦，人機俱毁，壯烈犧牲。他說到此處，呷一口茶，懷念着已故的門生，愴然淚下。</p>
<p>一門忠勇</p>
<p>八年抗戰，空軍人才輩出，在技術上，戰略上，確有長足進展，但物質條件不足，重工業缺乏，科學製造設備，尚待充實，技術人才，還須加緊訓練。總之，士氣旺盛，物質太差，理想健全的空軍，尚須吾人埋頭苦幹奮鬥！</p>
<p>將軍祖父諱盛鈞，庚子年任統領，八國聯軍入侵，守大沽口陣亡。父諱紹麟，任某軍支隊參謀長，反對洪憲，在魯灘縣遇難，國府明令褒揚。公子家忠，十七歲，肄業四川灌縣空軍幼年學校。提到他自己，他慚愧無地，僅僅犧牲了一只左臂。願以畢生所學，服務空軍，提倡航建，爲國努力！（朱家軍）</p>

<h3>鐵的隊伍·新的活力　七十四師整補工作在躍進中</h3>
<p>〔本報特約記者丁匡華南京十一日訊〕孟良崮戰役，忠勇壯烈，震動中外，他代表了中國的軍人魂，也代表中國的革命精神，張靈甫師長以下集體自殺，那種不屈不撓的犧牲，是何等的偉大。</p>
<p>邱維達師長　（本報特約記者丁匡華寄）</p>
<p>滁縣訪邱師長</p>
<p>剿匪的軍事，由於孟良崮一役，有一個莫大的轉機，使我們在戰果檢討的經騐中，嚴肅了紀律，改變了戰略。今天，魯中披露，魯西奏捷，殲滅了「人民解放軍」，包圍了劉伯誠主力……這都是七十四師壯烈犧牲所給予的後果。匪軍雖摧殘了整編七十四師有形的精華，但他絕沒有絲毫剝奪我七十四師無形的大無畏精神，那瑯琊山內，摩天嶺上，無數的戰士，正高歌着「我們是鐵的隊伍」的吼聲，組成了幹練的陳容，</p>
<p>重振旗鼓掃蕩中原，那是我們可以預卜的。</p>
<p>記者這次特地由南京到滁縣訪邱將軍，這一日他恰巧前　來安檢閱去了，等了一個鐘頭，他才回來。一下車，他就緊緊向記者握手。在辦公室坐定了，我不時向邱師長凝視着，接着問：「邱師長對七十四師孟良崮戰役的感想如何？」這一問打動了邱師長的心了，他很悲切的對記者說：「我與七十四師生死與共，現在我的長官同僚與部屬大半犧牲，真使我痛哭欲絕，我今天担任先烈未竟的任務，深深感着惶恐，但我相信，我有毅力，我有決心，我一定把這活力練成鐵的隊伍，來完成先烈未竟的遺志！」</p>
<p>「邱師長辦理善後的情形怎樣？」</p>
<p>「孟良崮戰役結束以後我兼程趕赴臨沂。</p>
<p>辦理善後收殮忠骸，收容脫險官兵，救護隨軍眷屬。移到碭山後，即辦理陣亡將士遺骸，撫郵，并親赴各醫院慰問傷兵，現各高級將領之忠骸已多覓獲成殮，分別運回原籍安葬，或擇地暫厝。茲為追念忠魂，決定在八月十三日開追悼大會，以慰忠魂！」</p>
<p>「貴師整補好了沒有？」</p>
<p>「我們移駐碭山後，國防部命令我就迫向豫南·皖中·皖南·各師區及宿遷團區，征募新兵萬名，補充缺額，以使這光榮的剿匪部隊，早日復原，因此，我隨即派遣幹部，組成若干</p>
<p>接兵大隊分途接領，不到兩月，就完成了這細胞的匯合，這時候，本部傷愈官兵，亦均出院來歸，新的活力，舊的精血，結成了這枝新生的隊伍。我相信不久就可作戰，并且一定可以洗刷孟良崮的創痕！」邱師長懷着這樣的信心和愉快的情緒告訴記者。</p>
<p>記者又詢邱師長的訓練情形，邱師長說，瑯琊山是一個絕好的所在，我就利用他來訓練幹部，由我</p>
<p>親自訓練共設軍官第一二三隊及軍七隊。此外，并設有醫護人員訓練班，通信人員訓練班，諜報人員訓練班，及電務人員訓練班，以求適合需要，現在本部已完成了×團的整補工作，再補充×團，就可達成他原來的編制。記者為着趕上「勝利號」夜車，不能與李參謀長久談，便與邱師長告別，邱師長說：「我們中原再見！」在記者的耳鼓中，這正是一個雄壯的怒吼！</p>
<p>新任七十四師師長邱維達將軍，是一個具有運籌帷幄天才的軍人，他是陸大出身，戰略戰術俱有精深的研究，他一向參贊王耀武將軍戎機。「輝煌軍」在湘西空前大捷，他就是那時第四方面軍的參謀長，因此，特別為王耀武所器重。京滬受降，他是五十一師師長，國軍整編後，他升任了整編七十四師副師長，這時山東局勢緊張，王耀武司令臨時又拉他出任山東心臟淄博地區的警備司令，不幸戰局逆轉，淄博撤退，在那種緊急局面下，他能把幾十個火車頭，及全部物資，搶運到了濟南。這次，他以副師長繼任師長，實在是一個再適當也沒有的人選。他現在正在日夜辛勞的整訓部隊，以期早日出發剿匪，替孟良崮犧牲的先烈報仇。</p>

<p>美金公債及　　，財部規定得以自由抵押，折扣暫按票面七折爲準以後，國家行局曾提出有關問題，請四聯總處核示。計分八點，（一）對於押款對象用途期限利率，如何規定，（二）美金公債，是否按組一二〇〇〇押抵國幣。（三）作押債劵，是否以各行局本身募銷者爲限。（四）美金債劵持有人，如以私人或團體名義，向行局申請押款，可否承做。（五）行局同人購買之債劵，如遇急需，可否准向各該行局抵押借款。（六）各行局如將押進之美金債劵，再向國行轉抵押，可否照辦。（七）各行局所掣發預約劵，一時不能換領正式債劵，其預約券能否同樣作抵，押借款項。（八）各種放款，按照規定，原須先行審查借款用途是否確實正當，方予貸放，如以此項率券公債申請借款時，是否隨時接受抵押。以上各點，經四聯總處轉財政部，分別核復：（一）銀行承做美金公債及庫劵抵押品之放款，其對象用途期限利率等，自應按照放款之規定辦理。（二）美金公債抵充借款押品時，按照中央銀行牌價，以七折計算，抵借國幣。（三）抵作借款之押品債劵，不以各行局本身募銷者爲限。（四）美金債券特有人，向行局申請押款，各行局可依照一般放款之規定辦理，並得視其本身頭寸情形，決定是否承做。（五）行局同人購買之債劵，依照一般放款之規定，自不得向各該行局申請抵押借款。（六）各行局以押進之債票，再向國行轉抵押一項，前經財公二字第二四六二六號代電，請中央銀行對於銀行錢莊酌量情形，於必要時參照暫定折扣爲拆放及轉抵押，以資週轉而利募銷。（七）各行局所掣發之預約券，僅爲掉換正式債劵之憑證，原不應作借款抵押品，惟爲便利購債人融通炎金起見，由各行局合辦，亦無不可。（八）美金公債及庫劵特有人申請借款，以是項債劵作抵押品，與第四項同。</p>
<h3>華股起伏狹隘　臨收又露疲態</h3>
<p>華股昨呈徬徨之象，銀行帮以及隔前多頭了結於先，永紗漲後有回，但證劵大戶買意尚切，少壯派亦再加碼，亦易拎高。十一時後，永公漲達限度，此際最爲俏利，紗價報疲，存多再加了結，散多不勝恐慌，臨收疲而恍惚。</p>
<p>晨開榮辱不一，遞永紗開後，八九號二一八號一七二號一〇六號買進，升至二〇四元，此時一般獲利者紛紛出籠，漲風不久即被阻遏。二三五號二二三號九七號一八六號及散戶咸賣，漸漸回下，二〇七號一五三號一五八號一二九號九四號俱有供給，九一號並售現永紗，而下降至即交一九六元，遞交一九八元低價。一六三號一三〇號維持即交，一二八號八九號一一二號三二號則進遞永紗，逐漸回升至二〇五元。一五七號一四九號五四號賣出，降至二〇〇。此時人心尚好，次熱頗見穩定。</p>
<p>十一時一刻，經一六二號廣帮拉停永公後，買氣重振，八九號四號一一七號二三二號三六號進至二〇八元，一六〇號一五三號三一號二三二號七六號一八六號陸續了結，檯面帮賣意亦濃，遞永紗曾回降至二〇〇元大關內。經一七七號力購現永紗，一六三號亦維持遞永紗，午收遂都以二〇〇元之價結束。收後喊價平和，次熱股除美亞見跌外，餘股亦起回升。新光臨收較爲生色，二〇四號等均加吸納也。</p>
<p>結果較前收計即交股美亞小挫，永公漲停後有回，軋好一成，永紗華豐新光景福勤興新華微升，中法漲半成，水泥尚平，統益微挫，景綸跌半成，火柴麗安新亞各好半成，餘股咸有微升。遞交股計美亞小挫，景福新光華豐微升，永紗平平，塲外谷老股稍形平疲‘</p>
<h3>統債升沉不一　外股形勢盤旋</h3>
<p>公債昨甲乙見低，餘者則見升，參差不一。統丙晨開一二〇〇〇元，自一一六〇〇元升至一二四〇〇元而後稍平，五五五室五〇三室有納，三六〇室五五〇室則出，成交約五百餘萬。結果較前收計甲乙跌四百元，丙戊各漲三百元，統丁則漲一一百元。</p>
<p>外股昨呈盤局，洋商有納，銀行帮則進，業廣證劵帮廣帮稍出。怡紗晨開八三〇〇〇元，高價八五五〇〇元，低價八二五〇〇元，而後稍回，港匯水業已回小少許，人心尚定。結果較前收計怡啤電話鋼業航業平平，紙業微挫，怡紗英聯會德豐業廣微升。</p>
<h3>油廠代榨食油　中信規定繳油量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局對前在蘇州平湖兩地收購運到菜籽，交第三區植物油製煉業工業同業公會榨製生菜油，茲經該局規定，各油廠繳油量，除水份灰質，一級含泥五斤者，應繳生菜油卅市斤，菜餅五十五市斤。二級合泥七斤者，應繳生菜油廿九市斤半，菜餅五十四市斤。三級含泥九斤者，應繳生菜油廿九斤，菜餅五十三斤。照上開列數量，除去榨費，按前核定，每市擔榨費折合菜餅四十二市斤餘，存菜餅連同菜油，由各廠開具提單，逕送該局備提。該局收到提單後，送交國行業務局，轉交民食調配委員會分配云。</p>
<h3>浮多頻頻吐售　綿紗布始堅終疲　龍頭細布曾喊進四十萬關</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以紡建公司開紗價未變動，二十支大發售九百五十萬，塲上做開再見上升，旋因各方浮多吐售，實銷仍呆，價告回軟。</p>
<p>最後四二支藍鳳紗爲一千六百零五萬元，三十二支一千三百三十萬元，比上日步漲三五十萬元。二十支特雙馬則反低十萬，爲一千一百萬元。輕雙馬九百七十萬元，軋升十萬，其他各支粗細紗升十萬至二十五萬。惟二十支天女人鐘雙地球，及十支金寳星等，依然呆疲云。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開台灣及長沙客帮略有進取，又以棉紗議價未見减低，人心復趨堅挺，市勢一度哄抬。迨至午收時，本街實銷不動，且有乘高吐售，市勢又告不支。</p>
<p>最後十二磅龍頭細布價爲四十萬零五千元，比上日回漲二萬二千元。五福藍鷄彩球陽鶴及特細布，亦升二萬二千至三萬，其餘細斜嗶嘰及漂布色布士林布等，亦均回挺自五六千至三萬元許，惟粗布價續下挫一萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：布市收盤以新賣又見活動，龍頭細布曾喊低至三十九萬七千元尚乏吃戶云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨循例售紗，共計三一三件，廠商申購單共一〇四張。</p>
<h3>現棉轉穩</h3>
<p>昨日現棉因棉紗回漲，人心好轉，趨勢已站平穩，交易亦較上日稍旺，紗廠頻有吸胃，同業亦互有進出，惟價格挫落後，客販已極虧本，故銀根寬裕者，仍不肯脫手。各檔做開送廠價：靈寳二〇六萬五千，沙市一九五萬，棧交價靈寳二〇〇萬，二〇二萬，又欠款價二〇五萬，二〇六萬五千，沙市一九〇萬，一九二萬，火機一五〇萬，以上各檔成交數約一，一〇〇餘包。</p>
<h3>購紗盈餘請予運用</h3>
<p>又訊：第六區棉紡公會，以前紡管會收購各廠棉紗所得盈餘，爲數甚鉅。特呈請紡調會維持原議，以此項贏餘，確定爲推廣棉產及發展紡織事業基金，並准組會保管運用。</p>
<h3>中信局收購新茶　決按成本計算</h3>
<p>中央信託局現正籌備收購三十六年度新茶，收購原則，決定按照成本計算。按三十五年度陳茶現已開始收購，收購價格係根據海外之價格而定。祁門定爲七十二萬一箱，海外之價格較國內爲低，故收購價格亦較低，今中信局爲體恤商艱，將三十六年新茶由茶葉公會提呈成本計算書，經該局加以審核調查，再加上合法之利潤而訂定收購價格，故新茶收購之價格，可較以往高多。太年度茶產較去年爲多，據茶葉商方面表示，倘中信局訂定收購價格較高，彼等有利可圖，產量尚可能坩加，目前逆滬者可押予農民銀行，迄昨日止，農行已接受押款之箱茶達五千餘箱云。</p>
<p>又悉：三十五年度之陳茶，現巳全部被法商永興公司收購，故中信局收購極少云。</p>
<p>又訊，昨日內銷茶依然動而乏整，致交易平庸，價格方面，雖在賣戶扳抬中，亦難進級，迨至收市，終呈堅穩之象。至於外銷茶，仍因進出兩稀，全日經過沉靜，大致與前相仿。</p>
<h3>撤銷煤斤管制說　燃管會並未奉到明令</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日外傳當局將撤銷煤斤管制，恢復自由採辦之說，記者特向燃管會某負賣人證實，據告：迄目前爲止，渠尚未接奉經部撤銷燃料管理之訓令。渠指出，目前燃料之管制，實緣於全國煤斤生產量不豐，不敷供應全國消耗量。當局爲調節盈虛，就各種事業與國計民生關係之深淺，及需要之緩急程度，作統籌性之運輸及分配，俾使煤斤短絀之嚴重性，减至最低程度。故在全國煤斤生產情形未復正常以前，撤銷管制，似屬不可能。最近外界盛傳撤銷之說，可能係當局擬舉辦定貨貸款，曾開亦包括煤斤在內，致誤傳爲煤斤將恢復自由運銷云。</p>
<p>又訊，燃管會爲充裕煤斤行來源起見，曾頒佈「准許廠商自行購運煤斤辦法」，唯該項條文內規定，每一廠商每月限購運一百噸，現以該項數量過微，不適合實際需要，故該會已呈准經濟部，將上項限制令取銷，今後煤商採購煤斤數量，已不予任何限制云</p>
<h3>食米賡續下游</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧四千四百餘石，消化不爽，市况賡續下游。粳米步削三五千至萬元，秈米亦挫六七千元，白陰元提高殺次，新粳暫乏變化。</p>
<p>麵粉升沉互有，洋粉實銷奇旺，異常俏俐，猛升萬元。廠粉平平，雜牌粉回小千元。麩皮鄉銷甚懈，初堅後疲，形勢看軟，略疲三五百元。豆餅交易平常，台灣略有進取，鄉莊寥寥，續跌一二千元。黃豆來源接連，去胃冷淡，江河日下，新陳黃豆繼續狂跌五六千至萬元。</p>
<p>菉荳逐步下降，再跌萬元。赤豆定局，蠶豆客帮本街進胃略淡，轉跌三五千元。苞米北洋不動，步跌萬元。仁糧亦然狂落萬元。芝蔴仍少生色，生仁華南停辦，本街去化稀寥，暴跌二三四萬元不一。</p>
<p>油市廣帮乏交，店胃極少，納戶看望不前，市勢步跌不已。生油明定暗呆，淸油軟化，豆油則暴跌二三萬元，菜油亦然在挫二三萬元，蔴油亦削一二萬元。</p>
<p>湘米報漲</p>
<p>〔本報衡陽十二日電〕湘糧開放出境，糧價上漲，頭機米每擔十五萬元，創本年湘糧最高紀錄。</p>
<p>暹米抵滬</p>
<p>中央信託局向暹羅訂購之食米一萬八千噸，現已有二千噸運抵滬，其餘絡續在運華途中，本月底以前全部可運到。又該局頃又向美洲商訂洋米一批，爲數甚多，俟雙方合同簽訂後，即可開始運滬云。</p>
<h3>白煤貨稀價堅</h3>
<p>煤市前因運煤卡車小工罷工，致使交易無形停頓，多日未能解決，昨日始行復工，賣買隨之推動。白煤因辦本關係，到貨不多，故銷令雖値淡月，行市尚堅，源華屑本月份船邊過駁派價已提高至八十萬元，焦炭存底較多，價尚平穩，烟煤廠銷淸淡，市勢較疲。辰谿統煤船邊過駁價已入一百廿萬元關。</p>
<h3>人造絲配價糾紛　絲織業昨日連續舉行會議　決推代表十五人晉京請願</h3>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑　十八歲少女待字閨中　後母作主代訂婚約　買賣式婚姻的糾紛</h3>
<p>編輯先生：敝友某甲，女性。十八歲時，由後母作主，憑媒與同屋之乙男訂婚。當時並未徵得用女同意，今甲女另有對象丙男，擬將原訂婚約，予以解除。茲有法律問題數則，請賜予解答。（一）甲女未成年時，其後母爲其代訂之婚約，是否有效？甲女現未滿法定年齡，可否登報否認該項婚約？（二）乙男如用非法手段威脅丙甲，應如何應付？（三）乙男如下同意解約，應如何應付？（四）甲方提議解約，是否要賠償對方損失，聘金應如何償還？（五）甲女可否不顧乙男干涉，逕與丙男訂婚？讀者張華國上。</p>
<p>〔本欄答〕（一）按照民法第九百七十二條規定婚約應由男女當事人自行訂定，否則無效。甲女之後母爲其代訂婚約，且未得其本人同意，此項婚約自屬無效，故不必登報否認。（二）乙男如用非法手段威脅甲丙，如確有證據，可依刑法第三百四十六條恐嚇罪向其起訴。（三）此項婚約旣屬無效，乙男無權加以干涉。（四）不必賠償損失，聘金由甲之後母負責償還。（五）甲女如已成年，可與丙男訂定婚約，乙男無法干涉。</p>

<h3>論經濟改革方案中的電信建設</h3>
<p>— 陶庸</p>
<p>八月一日國務會議討論並通過全國經濟委員會審查修正的經濟改革方案，對電信事業亦有論列。根據改革方案中乙項第四節第五六七條的規定，「電報由中央經營，航空航運在海空中特殊需要之無錢電台，在中央管理下，可自行設置」，「長途電話幹綫及省際綫路由中央數成，各省境內支綫，由省敷設，但不得與幹綫或省際綫平行，縣鄉支綫由敷設」。「市內電話，除院轄市及省轄市由中央辦理或公營外，其餘各縣鼓勵人民經營，並規定辦法，准與長途電話聯絡」。質言之，屬於全國性或省際性的電報電話事業歸中央辦理，省縣範圍內的長途電話由地方政府建設。縣及鄕鎭電話及一部份特種業務之無綫電台和廣播電台，在政府管理下，准由民營。</p>
<p>電信事業，是具有全國性甚至有國際性的交通建設，對整個國防，政治，經濟民生都息息相關，自應以國營爲宜。唯我國幅員遼闊，而電信範圍又異常廣泛，有電報，長途電話市內電話，廣播電台，航海航空聯絡通信等，若一一都由國營，非特力有不逮，所需時間亦難勝計。因此，就其性質與範園劃分爲國營，公營，民營，俾收分工合作之效，自屬賢明之舉。唯電信事業與其他工商業不同，除少數業務，如廣播電臺之類可以獲利外，大都無利可圖。即以電話言，依戰前的統計，每一用戶之設備成本，包括話機綫路，局內機器及局舍約須美金八十元，而話費收入，因係公用事業不能過重，除開支外，祗能繳付借款之利息。所有借款之攤本與成本之折舊，均無着落。故民營徒擁其名，而無其實，欲求普遍發展甚難。即以公營之長途電話言，亦惟着重於政治及治安方面並非爲便利民衆而設，此已失去電信爲公用事業之意義，故祗將權限分開而政府不加以協助及貼補，則公營民營之電信恐仍難發展，其次吾國多敷內地民衆，尚不知電信的用途及利益，故灌輸民衆電信智識，亦爲求發展電信之要圖。最後，爲减低成本起見，政府應獎勵電信機械之製造，使一般民衆均能享受。因此，我們希望政府對於上述的協助，敎育，製造三點同時加以注意，則國營公營民營可平衡發展，這樣，我國電信建設，才有輝煌的前途。</p>
<p>銅圖說明：上海電信局爲便利用戶問訊質疑起見，特設公衆服務台於各示範營業處。其工作範圍為（一）分發去電紙（二）代爲繕寫電報（三）管理營業處公用電話（四）注意營業處櫃外淸潔秩序事宜（五）指示發報人利用交際特快傳眞夜信諸電並告知各項電報納費及手續（六）報告特快電通阻情形（七）管理發報人失物待領事宜（八）指示發報人如何簡化拍電手續（九）報費計算錯誤時，代客核算（十）其他，上圖為福州路總營業處之公衆服務台</p>
<h3>本局業務概況（中）</h3>
<p>— 李桐</p>
<p>乙·電話部份</p>
<p>一·長途電話</p>
<p>A，有綫電</p>
<p>有綫長途電話電路，直達者有五十七路，通達地點爲南京，鎭江，無錫，吳縣，杭州，鄞縣，武進，常熟，漢口，徐州，蕪湖，太倉，嘉定，嘉興，川沙，崑山，閔行，寳山，松江，靑浦等廿處，另有無綫電超短波，（Radio　Link）南京三路，郢縣三路，其他轉接通話地點，計有百餘處，其中以京滬間通話最爲繁忙，故電路有十五對，其他京滬杭沿綫校大商埠，如吳縣七路，無錫五路，杭州九路。</p>
<p>B，無綫電</p>
<p>無綫電話電路共有兩座席，通話地點爲重慶，台北，北平，靑島，廣州，濟南，　　等地·正擬開放者，有天津，西安，蘭州，瀋陽。無綫電路因通話時間有限，且有時因天電干擾，故通話效率較有綫爲低</p>
<p>C，長話業務</p>
<p>特特快電　特快電去歲年底創辦。用戶在掛號後十分鐘內即可通話，開放地點，爲南京，鎭江，無錫，吳縣，杭州，嘉興，鄞縣，等七處。</p>
<p>代傳電話本局鑒於目前機綫缺乏，電路擁塞，用戶於掛號後，往往守候良入，如遇急需，將因之誤事。車船碼頭之乘客有急務欲與外埠通話至多不便，開放代傳電話。用戶僅需將受話人姓名，電話號碼，及欲傳達之意旨，塡寫於本局營業處之代傳電話掛號單上，或電告四六二七七•四六二七八本局代傳電話掛號台，即可於二小時內負責傳遞至受話人，穩妥迅速，便利適宜。</p>
<p>加急電話　加急電話次於特快，於掛號後一小時內接通，繁忙時最多通話以三次爲限。</p>
<p>尋常電話　尋常電話次於加急，於掛號後二小時內接通。</p>
<p>夜間减價通話　目前因機綫缺乏，故日間電路較形擁塞。用戶如遇非時間性之電話，可延　晚十一時後呌發，彼時電路較開，接　當爲迅速，其價目按日間七折優待，夜間通話時間爲晚十一時至次晨七時。</p>
<p>二·市內電話</p>
<p>上海市內電話因戰前外國在華租界關係，於前租界區域設立美商上海電話公司，與我國政府訂立合同，故勝利後租界雖經收回，然外商企業仍繼續存在。太局範圍僅及於閘北，虹口，南市，市中心，及浦東，龍華，眞茹，吳淞，等郊區，亦即一〇二」電話。其設備容量總約六千餘號，因八年抗戰，戰前設備悉被敵僞摧毁殆盡。接收後本局積極整理恢復，惟因器材缺乏，擴充困難，茲就本局範圍內市內電話之簡况列後：</p>
<p>（一）「〇二•六〇〇〇〇——六二五九九」係自動電話（虹口區</p>
<p>（二）「〇二·七〇〇〇〇——七一九九九」係自動電話（僅二〇〇）號可川其餘尚未修竣）（南市區）</p>
<p>（三）「〇二·五〇〇〇〇——五〇四九九」係自動電話（市中心區）</p>
<p>（四）「六四〇〇〇——六四〇四九」係磁石式電話（眞茹區）</p>
<p>（五）「六五〇〇〇——六五〇四九」係磁石式電話（吳淞區）</p>
<p>（六）「六六〇〇〇——六六〇五九」係共電式電話（復興　區）</p>
<p>（七）「七四〇〇〇——七四一一九」係共電式電話（浦東區）</p>
<p>（八）「七五〇〇——七五一二〇」係共電式電話（龍華區）</p>
<p>（營業部份待續）</p>
<h3>電花</h3>
<p>武康路（即　開森路）中國族行社內新設電報代辦所、便利西區民衆拍發電報。</p>
<p>上海電信局員工業已着手組織工會，由交通都指定局長郁秉堅指導，聞不日即將召開成立大會。</p>
<p>福州路總營業盧國內電報掛號處已遷至天津路長治路分當業處辦理</p>
<h3>電報傳遞的過程</h3>
<p>一張電報，從發報人遞給發報局的營業處，到收報人收到爲止，其間的過程也許一般人尚未注意到過程。現在讓我們拿這種處理電報的手續，介紹給續者諸君。關於營業處收報手續，凡發過電報的人，諒必都知道的，電報先由營業處送到報房裏，報房收到後，立即由分發員按收報地名，分別塡註路由，交編號員加編機上流水號數，送到機上編號拍　，對方局收到後，先交給分發員視收報地名，分別整檢，而有下列兩種情形：</p>
<p>（一）如係該局來報，送交來報編號員，編列來報流水號數後，交繕封員將收報人姓名住址開具報封，以一份封入　對內，交派送員按照收報人住址，分區飭報差投遞，其餘一份交覆核員覆核有無錯誤，或誤送情事，經過此一手續後，這張，電報就算告一段落，然後由裝訂員理順流水號數，裝訂成册，送入報底房存檔，以備必要時查閱。</p>
<p>（一）如係轉報，例如本局發宜昌之電報，因無直達電路，必須由漢口局轉遞，中間局機上收到後，按照收報地名，喜行轉出，收報局收到時，也照上述來報處理手續交差遞送。</p>
<p>電局爲審愼計，所有去報來報轉報經傳遞十後，均須交　核員覆核，倘有錯誤，隨時立即更正，以資補救，復爲迅擴計，各類電報之處理，均訂有時限，非有特殊原因，不得超起，以示服務週到之意。（黃炎）</p>
<h3>電信常識講話（二）</h3>
<p>— 張家盦</p>
<p>第二講　先看報頭</p>
<p>我的一位弟弟在寫信的時候常常漏寫日期，　　　　　的來信的人常會摸不着頭腦，不曉得那封信究竟是那一天寫的，我曾經不祗一次的要他糾正；其實我的弟弟也是一個吃電報飯的人，也許他意識到在電文人裏多打一個日期（通常用代日　自或代日代時常　）就得多費一個或二個字的報費，所以，下意識的他，在寫信的時候，也把日期雀略了！</p>
<p>事實上，一個精明的收信人，即便發信人沒有在信封上或信義上寫明日期，他也會從郵局在信封上蓋印的郵戳裏看出發信局收寄那封信的日期和時間來。同樣，一個精明的收報人，也能從電報的報頭裏省出那電報的發電日期，時間，和其他翼收發人有利的各項紀錄。如果通電　方的收發報人都懂得閱讀電報報頭的方法，那麼，不但收發報人對於電局的宜傳，能用事實來考騐它的億實性，而且，由於電報報　內巳有發電日期和時間的忠實紀錄，不用再在電文後面加用代日　目或代日代時電碼，至少每强電報可以節省一一方個字的報　。</p>
<p>電報報頭係在電報的上部，格式如下：</p>
<p>在電報報頭裏的各項紀錄中，除流水號數，原來號數省備註三類對於收發報人沒有多大直接關係外，其餘如報類，發報局名，字數，交發日期，和交發時刻等五項，收發糧人爲本身利益着想，都有瞭解它的意義的必要。因爲，從上面這些紀錄中，你可以看出這張電報是屬於那種報類，　　以查核電又裏的字句有沒有給電局漏拍，你更可以考騐　爾收發電報是否確極迅速。</p>
<p>通常私人間往來的國內電報，大槪不出下面五類：</p>
<p>（一）特快電報（報類爲LTN）（二）加急電報（報類爲D）</p>
<p>（三）尋常電報（報類爲P）（四）夜信電報（報　爲NLT）</p>
<p>（五）交際電報（報類爲SLT）（待續）</p>

<h3>Committee for Guidance of Trade with Japan Decides on Types of Imports and Exports; Our Delegation of Twenty to Depart in Late Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Committee for Guidance of Trade with Japan held its first meeting at 4:00 PM on the 13th. It was convened by Yang Shuren of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Attendees included Zhu Xi and Pan Lu of the Ministry of Finance; Wu Zhaohong and Zheng Youkui of the National Resources Commission; Jin Shixuan of the Ministry of Communications; Li Jiecai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Chen Zongjing of the Economic Affairs Commission; Zhang Yuanbing and Yang Jinsheng of the Central Trust of China; and Sun Zhongyue of the Export Promotion Commission. During the meeting, Yang Shuren first read out the "Organizational Measures and Implementation Outline for the Business Delegation to Japan" drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Attendees raised many opinions on the title of the delegation and other aspects. Finally, to save time, it was decided to first broadly exchange views on three major issues: the number of delegates, goods, and foreign exchange. Regarding the allocation of delegate numbers, it was decided that the number should not exceed twenty during the same period, with five from state-owned enterprises (one each from the China Textile Industries Corporation, China National Sericulture Corporation, and China National Plant Corporation; one from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation; one from the China Salt Company; one from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; and one from the Central Trust of China). Two would be from overseas Chinese merchants, and the remainder from industrial and commercial circles, with at least one from each of the nine regions of Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Chongqing, Hefei, and the Northeast. The National Federation of Commerce and the Federation of Industry Associations would decide first, and then notify the local chambers of commerce and branches of industry associations across the country. In addition, public-private joint ventures may also participate in the delegation. Regarding the types of imports and exports, it was decided that exports would mainly consist of tung oil, pig bristles, hemp, and refined salt, but this would still need to be checked against the items decided by the Far Eastern Commission for additions and deletions. Imports would mainly be those needed by our country. Items that our country can manufacture or that affect our industrial products would not be imported. The main imports would be transportation equipment, railway sleepers, industrial equipment, parts, chemical raw materials, rayon, silkworm eggs, mulberry seedlings, and agricultural production equipment and raw materials. Regarding foreign exchange, it was decided that each delegate could not carry more than $500 USD during their three-week stay in Japan. For import and export foreign exchange, the clearing standard would use a bookkeeping system. After obtaining foreign exchange in Japan, exporters would hand it over to the Central Trust of China for bookkeeping, so that they can purchase a corresponding amount of Japanese goods. This method is roughly similar to the import and export linkage method. The detailed rules for the above decisions still need to be discussed further at the second meeting on the morning of the 16th before a final decision is made. Other issues are also expected to be fully decided at the next meeting, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting next Tuesday. The first group of delegates is expected to depart in late this month. The name of the delegation was not decided at today's meeting, and there will not be a head of the delegation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The issue of allocating Japanese reparations materials to private industry was discussed at length at the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting held at 4:00 PM on the 13th. The political committee members spoke very enthusiastically. The final decisions were: (1) The total amount of Japanese reparations materials is 480,000 tons, of which the original plan was to allocate more than 30,000 tons to private industry, but this is now increased to 82,000 tons. (2) The total cost for dismantling and constructing factories using all reparations materials is estimated at 170 million national currency and 50 million US dollars. (3) The first batch of 100,000 to 120,000 tons will be shipped to China within the year, with Shanghai as the primary port. The dismantling and relocation costs will require 27.8 million national currency and 110,000 US dollars. (4) The original plan was to send 222 personnel for the first batch of dismantling, loading, and receiving. It has now been decided to reduce this by 55 personnel to save costs. (5) Private industry will purchase the materials at a price of $800 USD per ton. (6) The entire dismantling process will take several years.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Official sources say that government authorities and foreign trade experts are currently drafting a broad plan to support China's cotton yarn and textile industries in competing with Japanese exporters in the Nanyang market.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Executive Yuan held its fifth temporary meeting at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, chaired by Premier Zhang. The matters discussed were: (1) The Outline of Measures for Practicing Thrift and Restraining Consumption was amended and passed. (2) The Principles for Handling the Reception and Transportation of Japanese Reparations and Returned Materials were amended and passed. (3) The Organizational Regulations of the Commission for Supervising the Reception and Transportation of Japanese Reparations and Returned Materials were passed.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Reaches Shanghai Again; Immediately Proceeds to Inspect Guangzhou; Mission Did Not Participate in Discussions on Foreign Exchange Adjustments</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those who welcomed him at Jiangwan Airport included Zhang Bide, representative of Mayor Wu; Chen Guolian, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office; and Meyer, the U.S. Acting Consul General in Shanghai. Special Envoy Wedemeyer was still wearing the same light gray casual clothes as when he arrived in Shanghai last time, and was carrying a briefcase. After disembarking from the plane, he immediately took a special consulate car to the Silas Hard Guest House on Taft Road for rest. According to the mission's news advisor Watson, who told reporters at the airport, the group is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for two days, and will leave Shanghai for Guangzhou on the morning of the 15th. After a day or two stay in Guangzhou, they will quickly return to Nanjing.</p>
<p>It was also learned that when Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his mission flew from Shanghai to Huangzhou, his financial advisor Jenkins will remain in Shanghai to sort out economic and financial data on this matter. In addition, the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai will hold a cocktail party at the Hamilton Building from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM this afternoon to welcome Wedemeyer and his mission, and to entertain people from all walks of life. Regarding the suggestions previously provided by U.S. businessmen in this city regarding the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce, the mission is currently organizing them. Since arriving in China, the mission has received a large number of reports and letters, with the most on finance coming from Shanghai, and the most on culture coming from Peiping. Furthermore, according to people close to the mission, the group did not participate in the issue of adjusting foreign exchange rates.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] Taiwan News: General Wedemeyer, when meeting with Huang Chaoqin, Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, stated to Huang that the United States has no secret plans for Taiwan, and that American aid to China is purely out of the sincerity and friendly relations between the two countries.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 13th] Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou on the 15th. Originally, they planned to go to Hainan Island, and had ordered the Qiongyai District Commissioner's Office to prepare and provide information.

<h3>Officials Manipulate Floating Capital; Hindering China's Revival</h3>
<p>Envoy Wei Presents Views to Chairman</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] It was learned today that Special Envoy Wedemeyer recently advised Chairman Jiang that government officials' acquisition and manipulation of floating capital is the main obstacle to China's revival.

<h3>New Military Academy President; Actively Being Selected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] According to the Che Wen News Agency: The president of the new-style military academy being prepared by the Ministry of National Defense is currently being actively selected. It is said that the school is expected to complete all preparatory matters before October.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Guangzhou, 13th] The rumor that Huangpu will be rebuilt as a commercial port to compete with Hong Kong, and that the plan will be completed within five years, is now rampant again. After Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, recently made a short-term inspection of Huangpu, it has been rumored that Sun plans to use the area to train China's new army. Several old buildings of the Huangpu Military Academy still exist, and can be converted into barracks with slight repairs. The surrounding mountains can be used as excellent training areas for the army. Huangpu is close to the sea, and land transportation has a branch line connecting it to the Yuehan Railway. The convenience of transportation is probably the best in the country. Expanding Huangpu into a commercial port requires huge funds, materials, and engineering technology. This proposal was made before the war, but was abandoned due to the Japanese invasion of South China.</p>

<h3>Northeast Salt Exports; Still Far from Target</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 13th] As of now this year, 400,000 dan of salt from the Northeast have been exported to South Korea. However, due to security concerns, the target of exporting 2 million dan is still far away.

The annual production is 16 to 17 million dan, about half of the production during the enemy puppet period.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Peace Treaty Meeting; U.S. Proceeding Cautiously</h3>
<p>Nanjing Possibly the Signing Location</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The United States is still drafting a response to Moscow regarding the preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace treaty. Informed sources say that Washington is proceeding cautiously and is striving to get the Soviet Union to participate in future meetings. The suggestion by China that the final stage of the Japanese peace treaty meeting should be held in China has not received an official response. According to people paying attention to the situation in the Far East, Nanjing seems to logically be a possible place for the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, but it is too early to make a decision on this until the first stage of discussions is completed. Reports that MacArthur will return to Washington to attend the preliminary Japanese peace treaty meeting have not been confirmed by the White House and the Department of the Army, but it is said that MacArthur may attend the final signing ceremony of the Japanese peace treaty.</p>

<h3>Dihua Commemorates August 13th; Zhang Zhizhong and Song Xilian Deliver Speeches; Warn Countries with Aggressive Ambitions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 13th] At 10:30 AM on the 13th, the garrison in Xinjiang held a grand meeting at the Xida Building to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War and the "August 14th" Air Force Day.

Zhang said: "There are still people who are angering the Chinese people and stimulating the Chinese people. There is also another force in Xinjiang that is angering and stimulating the people of Xinjiang. I hope that these people will study the history of China's War of Resistance and understand the heroic feats shown by China in this war." Song said: "Any aggressor will fall before the banner of justice. The three fascist powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy were once very powerful at the beginning of the war, but in an instant they became historical remnants that stink for eternity. Countries with aggressive ambitions today should be alert to this." Wu Zexiang arrived in San Francisco on the same plane.</p>

He is also the chairman of the Bank of China, which has recently obtained the status of a bank engaged in international finance and commerce, so he plans to come to the United States to explore the possibility of supporting China's international trade. Kong said: "I have no official mission on this trip." He may go to Europe or other places to promote China's foreign trade. Wu Zexiang, the ambassador to Chile, arrived in San Francisco on the same plane as Kong.</p>
<h3>Punishing Bandits</h3>

<h3>Democratic Socialist Party Reform Faction; To Open National Congress Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Shiming, a senior member of the Democratic Socialist Party's reform faction, told reporters: "The party's National Congress is scheduled to open tomorrow and will not be postponed. The total number of delegates is about 70. The internal disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party have attracted the attention of the U.S. State Department. I was invited to meet with the U.S. Consul General yesterday to explain the situation in detail so that he can understand." Regarding the recent statement by the Democratic Constitutionalist Party that it would not unite with the reform faction, Wang believes that it is inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] Wu Xianzi, leader of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, recently issued a statement through the party's San Francisco headquarters denying the combination with the reform faction of the Democratic Socialist Party and reaffirming the restoration of the original name of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party. He sent a message to Li Daming, the person in charge of the headquarters, on the 13th to explain, believing that the Democratic Constitutionalist Party could no longer cooperate with Zhang Junmai, so it combined with the reform faction. Because he did not withdraw from the Democratic Socialist Party at the beginning, there was no need to restore the organization of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party. He hoped that the headquarters would no longer object to his decision. He still does not agree with independence, and he has also decided to hold a National Congress on May 5th, and will</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi Issues Statement; Discussing the Strained Sino-Soviet Situation; Advocating Direct Negotiations Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] On the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship on the 14th, Zeng Qi, chairman of the Youth Party, issued a statement saying: "When talking about Sino-Soviet relations, there are five points that we cannot forget and cannot ignore: (1) After the Soviet Union's revolution in 1917, it announced that it would abandon all rights of the Tsarist era in China, but the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is just the opposite. On the Chinese side, in order to enhance friendly relations, it does not hesitate to pay a heavy price, while on the Soviet side, it is based on the Yalta secret agreement, which was not agreed to by China. In substance and form, it has the meaning of restoring all the rights of the Tsarist era. (2) Regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union has taken three contradictory measures before and after. Initially, it returned it to China according to its revolutionary words, and then it sold it without authorization to Japan, China's enemy during the Sino-Japanese War. Finally, it requested joint Sino-Soviet management. (3) In the exchange of notes of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the agreement on Dalian, the Soviet government guaranteed to ensure China's jurisdiction over all the sovereignty of the three northeastern provinces, regarding it as "an inseparable part of China." However, two years after the signing of the treaty, Lushun and Dalian have not yet been handed over, and there have been actions that are contrary to friendship, such as: First, transporting away industrial machinery. Second, equipping the Chinese Communist army with Japanese weapons. Third, organizing Korean communist Japanese prisoners to assist the Chinese Communists in attacking the National Army. I don't know where China's sovereignty will be placed. (4) Regarding the Xinjiang issue, the Soviet Union also stated in the treaty exchange of notes that it would not interfere in China's internal affairs, but now it has instigated Outer Mongolia to invade Xinjiang, which is an open secret. (5) The treaty clearly stipulates that both parties agree to open Dalian as a free port, but now China cannot even enter the city of Dalian, let alone the friendly nations of Britain and the United States. Lushun and Dalian have become one of the Soviet Union's iron curtains, which is a major threat to peace in the Far East. I believe that the long-term stalemate in Sino-Soviet relations is not a blessing for world peace. There are only three ways to solve this problem: (1) Direct negotiations between the diplomatic authorities of China and the Soviet Union to thoroughly review where the responsibility for fulfilling the treaty lies. If necessary, a new treaty can be signed, extending it from thirty years to fifty years. China has no intention of invading the Soviet Union, which should be believed by the world. (2) Britain and the United States should come forward to mediate, and use the compromise of the five-nation foreign ministers meeting. (3) Arbitration by the UN Security Council. The first approach is still the best, because we sincerely hope that China and the Soviet Union can automatically reconcile and have half a century of peace, without the need for a third party to mediate. If the first approach does not work, then the second and third approaches can also be chosen. In short, the stalemate must be broken, and it must not be allowed to drag on, so as to cause unpredictable disasters."</p>

<h3>Zhang Junmai Gives Talk in Guling; Wei's Visit Related to Stabilizing People's Livelihood; Advocates Party Nomination for Election Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 13th] Zhang Junmai arrived in Guling at 8:40 PM on the 13th. Those who came with him included his foreign female secretary, Miss Mai Luona, etc. They stayed at Zhang Jia'ao's residence. Zhang left the Jingxi Hotel in Beijing on the 12th and arrived in Xunzhou at 5:00 PM on the 13th before ascending Lushan. Our reporter interviewed Zhang that night and asked about the opinions he raised during the meeting with Wedemeyer in Shanghai. Zhang avoided answering this question, but said: "Wei's visit will be of great help to our country. As for how the United States will provide assistance, it all depends on the results of Wei's investigation this time." Zhang said: "Wei expressed his most friendly attitude during the talks, hoping that our country's politics would move towards democracy, and hoping that our people's lives could be stabilized. Zhang believes that Wei's visit will have a significant relationship with stabilizing the lives of the people, and whether the people's lives can be stabilized depends on whether politics are clarified as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guling, 13th] When Zhang Junmai received our reporter on the evening of the 13th, he talked about the recent disputes in the Democratic Socialist Party. He pointed out three points: (1) Some people say that he is dictatorial, but this is not the case. He is open about everything. (2) Most of the overseas party members support him. They have no problem supporting the Democratic Socialist Party. (3) After Wu Xianzi left the Democratic Socialist Party, the government should have considered filling the vacancy in his government committee, but the Democratic Socialist Party does not intend to recommend a successor. During the conversation, Zhang criticized Li Daming and others for not understanding the national conditions, such as hoping that he would serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, and that the Democratic Socialist Party should have four government committee members, two ministers, and one political committee member, etc. In fact, he himself would never be able to serve as the President of the Executive Yuan. Zhang expressed optimism about the disputes in the Democratic Socialist Party, believing that overseas representatives had participated in the recent National Congress, so the matter of the Democratic Constitutionalists leaving the party was not serious. Regarding the election issue, he advocated the party nomination method. It is said that in the general election this autumn, the Kuomintang hopes that people from all parties and factions will participate, but the strength of the various parties and factions is difficult to compete with the Kuomintang. The party nomination method is to make a proportional stipulation for the candidates, not to make a proportional stipulation for the election results. The final decision-making power is still in the hands of the voters. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party will participate in the election, which will be controlled by the party. The Central Party Headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party has established a general election office to preside over the matter.</p>
<h3>Principles for Adjusting the Treatment of Public Education and Military Personnel; Regardless of Region, the Basic Amount is Increased by 10 Million</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel and military personnel has been decided by the Executive Yuan. It is understood that the adjustment will be based on the following principles: (1) Military personnel and public education personnel will be treated equally and retired equally, and it is decided to implement this from this month. (2) In the past, the standard for public education personnel was divided into five regional levels, but this time it will be reduced to four regional levels. (3) In the past, the applicable levels for various cities have changed greatly due to different price increases and decreases and different cost-of-living indexes in the past three months. (4) This adjustment will increase the basic amount by 100,000 yuan regardless of the region. The plan formed according to the above principles will be finalized after the State Council meeting on the 15th.</p>
<h3>The Question of Foreign Investment in China: Director Dong Publishes Chairman Zhang's Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Director Dong Xianguang of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, at a press conference on the 13th, released the following statement from Chairman Zhang of the Executive Yuan regarding foreign investment in Chinese industry:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of foreign investment and technical cooperation in China, the Chinese government, through the former Supreme National Defense Council, has explicitly stipulated the principles for the first phase of post-war economic construction. Furthermore, Chinese laws such as the Company Law and Mining Law have been promulgated, and explicit provisions exist for foreign companies, Sino-foreign joint ventures, participation in share capital, and acquisition of mining rights. Relevant provisions are also included in the Sino-foreign commercial treaties currently under negotiation. To ensure that foreign investors understand the policies held by the Chinese government, the Chinese government will further explain the following items:</p>
<p>Regarding the Scope of Industries in Which Foreign Companies Can Directly Invest</p>
<p>The term "direct investment" in this context is interpreted as referring to foreign companies investing in China under the names of foreigners or foreign legal entities, operating independently in the manufacturing industry. All industries, except those that should be state-owned as specified in the second section of this statement and those that Chinese laws stipulate should be operated by Chinese individuals or Chinese legal entities, can be directly invested in by foreign companies. For example, the manufacturing industries of large-scale power engines, machine tools, automobiles, motorcycles, airplanes, and larger ships are particularly welcome.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Scope of State-Owned Industries Stipulated by the Chinese Government</p>
<p>The Chinese government reserves the industries that are entirely state-owned. According to item B of Article 2 of the first phase of economic construction principles, the types of enterprises exclusively operated by the government are not intended to be excessive, including armories, mints, major railways, and large-scale hydroelectric power plants.</p>
<p>According to Articles 9 and 10 of the Mining Law, various minerals should be state-owned. However, such state-owned mining enterprises can still be operated jointly with private citizens or foreigners, or leased to private management.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Scope of Industries That Can Allow Simultaneous State-Owned and Private Operation, and Joint Public-Private Operation, and the Treatment Enjoyed</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, Article 2 of the first phase of economic construction principles already has specific provisions. The relevant items are excerpted as follows: (A) Enterprises not designated for exclusive government operation (except those restricted by law) can be operated by private citizens. (B) For enterprises that private resources cannot adequately undertake, or that the government considers require special attention, such as large-scale oil mines, steel plants, and shipping enterprises, the government may still operate them independently or jointly with private or foreign capital. (C) Enterprises jointly operated by the government and private or foreign capital should adopt a company system. The government, in addition to exercising administrative supervision according to law, should exercise its management of the company's business and personnel in the position of a shareholder. (D) Enterprises operated by the government, except those exclusively operated by the government, whether operated independently or jointly with private or foreign capital, if they have commercial characteristics, enjoy the same rights and obligations as similar private enterprises.</p>
<p>The Chinese government particularly welcomes foreign companies to jointly invest with Chinese citizens in establishing industries. In addition, regarding the allocation and settlement of foreign exchange, the allocation of raw materials, loans, and import permit quotas, these are handled in accordance with the current foreign exchange control regulations and the "Provisional Regulations for Amendment of Import and Export Trade" promulgated in the 1936th year. State-owned enterprises and private enterprises are treated equally, and no preferential rights are allowed.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the Scope of Industries Not Allowed for Foreign Company Operation</p>
<p>According to item 2 of paragraph 1 of Article 293 of the Chinese Company Law, the business areas and types of foreign companies can be restricted.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding Laws and Customs Duties</p>
<p>Chinese tax laws stipulate that foreign businesses operating within Chinese territory shall be subject to the same tax rates as domestic citizens, which should not hinder the acquisition of reasonable industrial profits.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding Whether Profits from Investment Can Be Remitted Back to Foreign Countries, and Whether Foreign Exchange Can Be Purchased for Necessary Materials and Labor That Must Be Imported from Foreign Countries</p>
<p>In principle, profits earned by foreign companies investing in industry in China can be remitted back to foreign countries. During the current period of foreign exchange control in China, this is of course subject to time limits. However, the government is currently formulating measures to allow an appropriate portion of profits earned by foreign companies investing in industry to be remitted back to their home countries. As for materials and labor required for business operations that must be imported from foreign countries, these will of course be reviewed and approved in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for Amendment of Import and Export Trade" during the period of foreign exchange control.</p>
<p>(7) Regarding the Issue of Local Governments Promulgating Regulations Concerning Foreign Business Operations</p>
<p>The promulgation of all current important local regulations has been approved by the central government, which should not violate the Chinese government's policy of welcoming foreign investment or hinder merchants from operating their businesses according to sound principles.</p>
<p>[United Press, this city] Foreign merchants here are very interested in Chairman Zhang's call for foreigners to invest in China. However, they stated that they had heard similar measures before and will temporarily reserve comment "pending the realization of this matter." One important foreigner stated that building heavy industries, such as the manufacturing of ships, locomotives, automobiles, and machine tools, could solve China's economic problems, but this matter is quite difficult. The current inflation almost makes it difficult to proceed immediately, although such industries could prevent inflation, the current inflation is sufficient to hinder the opportunity for these industries to appear.</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits Use UNRRA Materials for Combat; UNRRA Staff List Facts to Prove</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] Howard, a reporter for Newton, reported from Shanghai that, according to eyewitness accounts from UNRRA American staff in the Communist-controlled areas, the Communist army has used UNRRA materials for combat.</p>
<p>Communist spokespersons have repeatedly accused the National Government of interfering with the transportation of UNRRA materials and have insisted that relief materials transported to the Communist-controlled areas must be distributed on a fair and equal basis and must never be used for military purposes. However, reports from UNRRA staff reveal: (1) On July 17th, a food warehouse in Fugou, a major distribution point in the UNRRA Henan flood relief area, was stormed by a group of Communist troops, and food was taken away.

<h3>Government Decides to Continue Repaying Pre-War Foreign Debts; Director Dong Explains China's Sincerity in Maintaining Creditworthiness</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] When a reporter asked what the government would do about the fact that the Chinese government had not resumed repayment of various pre-war foreign debts since suspending payments in 1939, Director Dong replied today:</p>
<p>The Chinese government solemnly expresses its determination to resume repayment of various foreign debts suspended during the Sino-Japanese War. The various new debts raised in recent years do not hinder the collateral of pre-war debts or harm the rights and interests of the holders of those debts. At the same time, the Chinese government hopes to maintain its policy of maintaining creditworthiness and will soon gradually reorganize old debts.</p>
<p>Looking back at the years before the war, the Chinese government resolved many old outstanding cases left over from the former Beijing government. There was significant progress in reorganizing foreign debts. Unfortunately, these arduous efforts were destroyed by the Japanese enemy's invasion.</p>
<p>During the first year and a half of the war, although customs duties, which guaranteed foreign debts, were severely hindered by the war, the Chinese government continued to maintain its debts as scheduled and repaid the principal and interest in full. Amid this unprecedented national crisis, this achievement seems sufficient to demonstrate China's sincerity in striving to maintain creditworthiness.</p>
<p>By the spring of 1939, almost all of China's main tax revenues were controlled by the enemy. The Chinese government was forced to temporarily suspend various debt payments. Creditors in various countries were able to sympathize with and understand this measure. The Chinese government is deeply grateful.</p>
<p>China's war of resistance lasted the longest and suffered the greatest losses in this world war against aggression. Now that the war is over, China's economic and financial recovery work has only just begun, and the urgent need for reconstruction funds constitutes a difficult burden on current finances, especially in terms of foreign exchange. On the other hand, the restoration of normal operations in all sectors of national industry, commerce, transportation, and tax administration will take a considerable amount of time. Today's China, like most other countries after the war, still needs to rely on international economic assistance to develop industry and commerce in order to cultivate debt repayment capabilities.</p>
<p>Even so, the Chinese government is determined to make its best efforts to fulfill its debt repayment obligations and sincerely hopes that the financial situation can be improved as soon as possible so that pre-war debts can be restored for repayment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to unofficial estimates, China's pre-war foreign debt totaled approximately $500 million, £51 million, 138 million French francs, 53 million Belgian francs, and 30 million Dutch guilders. Repayment work was suspended in the spring of 1939 due to the war.</p>

<h3>Striving for Diplomatic Initiative – Reflections on the Second Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>It has been two years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. The signing of this treaty inevitably cast a heavy shadow on the minds of the Chinese people. In the early days of the War of Resistance, we were grateful for the assistance from our great northern neighbor. Unexpectedly, as our historical struggle was nearing victory, such a treaty of friendship was signed. Precisely because of friendship, the Chinese people, with the spirit of a warrior severing his arm, harbored no complaints or resentment about the signing of this treaty; instead, they placed ardent hopes on it. They hoped that through the signing of this treaty, Sino-Soviet relations would embark on a new chapter. However, the developments of the past two years have not only failed to meet the expectations of the Chinese people but have also left them with a sense of disillusionment about the future. Today, on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, no Chinese person can avoid a heavy heart.</p>
<p>Since the October Revolution, the Chinese people have consistently held deep concern and sincere expectations for their northern neighbor. During China's National Revolution, they were the first to witness Lenin declare the abolition of the privileges obtained by the Tsarist era in China, voluntarily relinquishing various privileges in China. Needless to say, this created a good impression in the minds of the Chinese people. Later, as the National Revolution unfolded in the Pearl River basin, the Soviet Union provided moral support. Despite the existence of the Communist bandits, the Chinese people regarded them as an internal problem and consistently refrained from involving it in Sino-Soviet relations. The Soviet government's support for us in the early stages of the War of Resistance further proved that the views held by the Chinese people were not mistaken. China and the Soviet Union share a land border of unparalleled length. What the Chinese people hope for is to live in peace and harmony with our northern neighbor and to foster even closer relations. It was under this sentiment that we witnessed the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the development of Sino-Soviet relations in the past two years has been deeply disappointing. Two years have passed since the cessation of hostilities against Japan, yet our entire sovereignty over the Northeast has not yet been fully recovered. Although Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian are to be special zones according to the previous treaty, the special status stipulated in the treaty has not yet materialized. Two years have passed since the end of the war against Japan, yet the officials sent by China to Dalian have not been able to assume their posts. As for the stripping of industrial and mining equipment, the lingering presence of Japanese prisoners of war, the armed influx of Korean people, and the occupation by the Communist bandits, objective and detailed reports have long been provided by impartial journalists. We abandoned Outer Mongolia with the spirit of a warrior severing his arm, originally hoping that the situation in the Northeast would become simpler; alas, the developments of the past two years have greatly deviated from our expectations! Moreover, what makes us even more disappointed is that not only is the Northeast in such a state, but Xinjiang and the Northwest are also facing multiple troubles. Outer Mongolia's invasion of Xinjiang included the overt participation of Soviet aircraft in combat, and the Soviet Union even supported Outer Mongolia's fabrication of evidence regarding the Sino-Mongolian border. It can be said that over the past two years, we have demonstrated our greatest friendship through the signing of this Treaty of Friendship; however, the actions of the Soviet Union clearly do not align with the spirit of friendship. Now, on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, as we look ahead to the future of Sino-Soviet relations, we cannot help but express our heavy hearts, approximately as follows:</p>
<p>First, the developments of the past two years not only clearly indicate that the Soviet Union lacks the sincerity to fulfill its obligations under the aforementioned treaty, but also, on the one hand, supports Outer Mongolia's invasion of our territory, and on the other hand, provides support to the Communist bandits in our country. Its actions are, in fact, manifestly unfriendly. Under these circumstances, our unilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union seem to have little significance. At this time, we should urgently take diplomatic initiative, making public to the world the process of the development of Sino-Soviet relations over the past two years, at least so that world opinion and future historians can see the full picture of this development and reach a fair judgment. Furthermore, disputes between nations, such as disputes over the interpretation of treaties, have internationally recognized peaceful resolution methods. If Sino-Soviet opinions regarding the interpretation of the treaty cannot be reconciled, resulting in our failure to fully recover sovereignty over the Northeast, we can certainly appeal to permanent international institutions for their impartial adjudication. In this era of darkness and an extremely bleak diplomatic situation, our efforts should be focused on dispelling the gloom and making the future situation increasingly clear.</p>
<p>Second, we must point out that the development of Sino-Soviet relations to the current stage is mainly due to our inheriting a legacy in which we had no say. Yalta was a major adventure in international politics; it can also be said to have been a major gamble. Unfortunately, President Roosevelt passed away before the war against Japan was over and before the Soviet Union had participated in the war against Japan. Due to this "fait accompli," we witnessed the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. As we reflect on the development of Sino-Soviet relations over the past two years, we cannot help but think of Yalta. Although President Roosevelt is now gone, the responsibility that the United States bears for future international politics, especially in the Far East, has not diminished with the president's death; on the contrary, it has assumed an even greater moral responsibility. How Sino-Soviet relations will develop in the future, as in the past, will be largely determined by how Soviet-American relations develop. Only under this broader perspective can we properly address the evolution of Sino-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we have always cherished the friendship of the Soviet Union; although the current stage of Sino-Soviet relations is not ideal, we always hope that the two great neighbors, China and the Soviet Union, can become increasingly friendly. We harbor no anti-Soviet sentiment, and we certainly do not hope for a deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations. We hope that they can restore the harmony they had during the war, allowing the post-war world situation to become increasingly stable. Today, on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, looking around at the domestic and international situation, we cannot help but feel a multitude of emotions; doing our best, we should strive to seize the initiative in our diplomacy at this moment, so that the future diplomatic situation can become increasingly clear!</p>

<h3>U.S. to Take Active Measures to Safeguard Peace in the Balkans; Greek Independence Must Not Be Threatened Again</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, 12th] The United States stated frankly in the Security Council today that if action in the Balkans is undermined by the veto, the United States is prepared to take independent measures to maintain peace. U.S. Representative Johnson, in his most impassioned speech, accused the Communists of being responsible for the unrest in Greece and directly accused Greece's northern neighbors of being aggressors. He stated, "The U.S. government is now prepared to join with any other member state of the United Nations to take measures to help Greece maintain its independence. The complete deadlock created within the UN framework on the Balkan issue has extinguished any hope for a compromise solution. There is no need to bow to the threat of the veto any longer. It is now time to record our honest opinions. The United States believes that Greece has been seriously threatened by guerrillas supported by Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, as well as by the Greek Communist Party, whose goal is to establish a totalitarian government subservient to Communist-controlled countries. The United States will not stand idly by while Greece's territorial integrity and national independence are repeatedly challenged. We do not believe that our obligations within the UN framework end simply because our goals are thwarted by the veto. This use of the veto is clearly protecting the aggression of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. We are willing to declare unequivocally that we will not hesitate to use every possible method within the scope of the Charter to maintain international peace and provide Greece with the necessary protection. The U.S. government believes that the Security Council's failure to take effective action due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto does not preclude other countries from taking individual or collective action, as long as such action is consistent with the general goals and principles of the United Nations. With regard to the Soviet Union's use of the veto to obstruct the Security Council's actions, we firmly believe that the UN General Assembly may still fully exercise its authority to safeguard Greece. The United States is prepared to implement any recommendations made by the General Assembly to resolve this issue. The United States is also prepared to cooperate with member states of the United Nations who share the same aspirations, taking any necessary steps within the scope of the General Assembly's recommendations or the Charter, to provide Greece with the safeguards it is entitled to enjoy under the Charter." Johnson was referring to Article 51 of the Charter. The U.S. representative also submitted a resolution requesting the Security Council to ascertain that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia were indeed supporting Greek guerrillas, thereby constituting a threat to peace as described in Chapter VII of the Charter. The resolution further requested the three countries to cease their assistance to Greek guerrillas and instructed the UN Balkan Committee to closely monitor developments. The Council subsequently announced an adjournment until Thursday to continue the debate.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare in Greece Enters a New Phase</h3>
<p>[Reuters News Agency, Jannina, Northern Greece, 12th] The guerrilla warfare in Greece appears to have entered a new phase, with rebels, sheltered and supplied by neighboring countries, gradually increasing their actions to intrude and harass Greek territory. Although the state of shock caused by the recent invasion of the city of Konitsa by 2,000 guerrillas from Albania is gradually fading, observers generally agree that such incidents will occur frequently along the 600-mile border of northern Greece in the future. One of the reasons for the increase in foreign guerrillas may be the hope that the army, after four months of suppression, has driven most of the guerrillas out of the country. The Greek government's previous claim that the invading forces included international brigades has not yet been confirmed.</p>

The vote was on a procedural matter, not a substantive one, so the negative votes cast by Britain and France were not considered an exercise of the veto. Dutch representative van Kleffens immediately requested that the Council also allow representatives from East Indonesia and Borneo to present their views. The Council then adjourned until Sunday afternoon to hear Sjahrir's views.</p>
<h3>U.S. to Lend Japan a Large Sum, Totaling About $500 Million Largely Decided; Rumors U.S. Plans to Lend Another $600 Million with Gold and Silver as Collateral</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] It is reported that negotiations for Japan to borrow $400 to $500 million from the United States are nearing completion. Of the loan, $300 million will be used to assist Japan in purchasing raw materials and other industrial necessities needed to manufacture export products. This loan will be used as a revolving fund, from which to pay for essential imports such as raw materials and machinery, while the profits from goods manufactured from these raw materials will remain in the fund. The purchase of raw cotton will be financed by a loan from the North American Cotton Company, to be repaid in manufactured goods within six months. This loan is approximately $150 million. It is rumored that the United States also intends to lend Japan $600 million, with gold and silver stored in the Bank of Japan as collateral. However, due to the limitations of factory capacity and the lack of fuel, Japan cannot utilize such a large loan. Since the surrender, the value of gold and silver stored in the Bank of Japan is approximately $250 million. However, at the beginning of the occupation, the Allied Headquarters announced that $43,517,600 of the gold and silver belonged to Thailand, and $37,023,630 belonged to Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Part of Gold Should Belong to Our Country</h3>
<p>In addition, silver ingots worth $314,572 and gold ingots worth $680,015 belong to the Chinese puppet United Reserve Bank. As a result, $80 million of the gold and silver must be returned to Thailand, Vietnam, and China respectively, with the remaining value of approximately $200 million. The United States originally intended to use this as reparations. Therefore, the current U.S. lending to Japan is actually sacrificing a large amount of reparations and providing a loan that is three times that amount. Furthermore, the U.S. loan can only be used to purchase raw materials and other necessities for manufacturing exports and cannot be used for domestic reconstruction work.</p>
<h3>U.S. Soldier Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Raping Japanese Woman</h3>

<h3>British and American Experts Meet in Washington to Review Increase in Ruhr Coal Production; This Move Has Major Implications for Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] British and American officials are holding a meeting here today to increase Ruhr coal production. Both sides recognize that the outcome of the meeting has significant implications for the success of the Marshall Plan. Seven countries depend on the supply of Ruhr coal for their recovery, which is as important as food. The meeting will develop a detailed plan to gradually increase Ruhr coal production. The U.S. government will increase current production from 220,000 tons per day to approximately 300,000 tons by December, and then to 350,000 tons. The British attitude is that the increase in coal production depends on resolving other fundamental issues, such as finance, food, and transportation. The U.S. State Department is unwilling to discuss this.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The British and American Ruhr coal production conference entered its second day today. Representatives from both sides are trying to solve the transportation problem in western Germany in order to transport coal produced in the Ruhr region to factories in Germany and other neighboring countries. Due to a severe shortage of railway cars and locomotives, millions of tons of coal are currently piled up near the mines.</p>

<h3>Ban on Dancing Affects Tax Revenue; Should Be Gradually Phased Out; Director Wu's Remarks in Nanjing Before Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office, 13th] After arriving in Nanjing, Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian met with Minister Gu and others of the Ministry of Social Affairs to discuss the Shanghai dance ban and the handling of the Shanghai election. Having completed his official duties, he is scheduled to return to Shanghai by train on the evening of the 13th. According to Director Wu, Mayor Wu mentioned the dance ban when he visited the Chairman in Nanjing last time. The Mayor elaborated on the impact of this matter on Shanghai's fiscal revenue. Director Wu believes that to abolish dancing, one should first restrict the establishment of dance halls, impose high taxes to gradually phase them out, rather than completely ban them in a short period of time. According to an important official in Shanghai, many people in Shanghai depend on dancing for a living, and many Chinese and foreigners consider it a legitimate form of entertainment. Completely banning it would not only affect prosperity but also affect public security. Implementing thrift and banning dancing should also be done gradually.</p>
<h3>Dismissal Pay Issue; Arbitration Committee Holds Subcommittee Meeting; Labor and Management Argue Fiercely</h3>
<p>[Report from our news desk] Labor and management in the city have been in dispute over the issue of dismissal pay for workers with indefinite contracts. The seven-member subcommittee of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee met again at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, chaired by Li Jianhua. During the meeting, the committee members from both labor and management argued vigorously. The management representatives demanded the abolition of the arbitration committee's methods, arguing that there was no legal basis for them and that they should be handled entirely in accordance with the Factory Law. The labor representatives argued that the Factory Law was enacted a long time ago and does not conform to the actual situation, so they have requested the central government to amend it. The Factory Law was formulated before the war in times of peace, when it was easier to find work after being dismissed. Therefore, the payment of dismissal pay was less. Now that industry and commerce are declining, it is very difficult for workers to find new jobs once they are unemployed, and the payment of dismissal pay is to help them maintain a bare minimum of living during the transition period. The Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's regulations on dismissal pay, at least half a month's pay and at most three months' pay, are based on factual circumstances and have been submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for record and implementation, so they cannot be changed. As the two sides could not reach an agreement, the subcommittee decided to submit the opinions of both labor and management to the Ministry of Social Affairs for a decision.</p>

<h3>Second Case of True Cholera: Patient Came to Shanghai from Nantong</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The second cholera patient of this year in this city was discovered on the 10th of this month. The patient, Lin Jinshou, male, 29 years old, is from Putian, Fujian. He was conscripted into the army in his hometown and departed with the troops to Shandong. When passing through Nantong, due to physical weakness, he was discharged and stayed in Nantong.

<h3>Extradition of American Soldier for Confrontation: Quelly Provides Detailed Account of Incident; Based on Court's Autopsy Report, Maley More Likely to Have Fired the Gun</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Englishman Quelly and American Army Corporal Maley conspiring to murder black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao has been investigated repeatedly by both the American and Chinese military police in recent days, and after examining Yu Shengxiao's body, many new clues have been discovered.</p>
<p>Since Quelly was brought by the Criminal Investigation Division of the US Military Police Headquarters to testify, the police department subsequently extradited Maley to the bureau for confrontation with Quelly. Both sides continued to shift responsibility to each other. However, judging from various signs, Maley's suspicion of murder is more obvious.</p>
<p>During this interrogation, Quelly provided a more detailed account than before. He said that while driving past the Hongqiao Club, he suddenly heard Maley threatening loudly and forcibly grabbing Yu Shengxiao, ordering him to "lie down." Yu struggled at the time, which resulted in him being struck hard with the gun handle. Following this, Maley immediately fired a shot. When he heard the shot, he slowed down the car, but Maley continued to order him to drive forward, telling him to turn into any side road they encountered.</p>
<p>Abandoning the Body in the Woods</p>
<p>When they reached the Qinghu border, Maley ordered him to stop because there were trees along the road. Then he saw Maley open the car door and drag the injured Yu Shengxiao out of the car, resulting in mud on his leather shoes and bloodstains on his socks. Afterwards, Maley even ordered him to drive forward. At this time, Maley picked up a towel that Yu Shengxiao had tied around his arm to wipe sweat with, and used it to wipe the bloodstains in the car. After driving for a short while, Maley ordered him to turn east. When they drove past the crime scene, Maley threw the bloodstained towel out of the car. After entering the city, they first went to his residence to rest briefly, and then drove out again. At that time, he intended to sell a gold bar first for their expenses, but because it was too late, it was difficult to sell despite trying everywhere. Later, he drove to the Huizhong Hotel.</p>
<p>Bullet Head Recovered</p>
<p>On the way, Maley found a bullet head on the floor of the front seat and raised it to him, saying, "Do you see that?" He immediately put it into his pocket.</p>
<p>Quelle also added that there was no magazine in the gun. He said that after Maley shot Yu Shengxiao, when he glanced back, he saw Maley throw something that looked very much like a magazine out of the car. However, Maley's statement to the police was that Yu Shengxiao was shot and killed by Quelly who turned around from the front seat and shot him, then ordered him to open the car door and throw the body out. As for the five gold bars, Quelly first ordered him to place them on the empty seat in the front, and then took the opportunity to attack him when he leaned over. At that time, because the gun was in Quelly's hand, he had to obey his orders.</p>
<p>Injured Area</p>
<p>According to the police department, based on the court's autopsy results, the bullet entered from the eighth rib behind the left side and exited from the third rib in front of the right side, moving upwards. Therefore, based on the reasoning, it is generally believed that Maley was more likely to have fired the gun.</p>
<p>The towel mentioned above is actually an important key to solving this case. When the police department investigated the scene of the incident, they first found this bloodstained towel. Later, after comparing it with the bloodstains on Maley's socks, they discovered that it was the same blood type, and determined that Maley was indeed an accomplice in the murder.</p>
<h3>American Military Representatives Inquire About the Condition of the Corpse Examination</h3>
<p>[Further News] At around 9:00 AM yesterday, representatives from the Criminal Investigation Division of the US Army Headquarters in China, Cos and an assistant, went to the forensic office of the District Procuratorate to inquire about the autopsy of Yu Shengxiao's body. The assistant took off his coat, and forensic doctor Wang Sijian used a pen to outline the wounds on his body, performing a demonstration on the spot, and recorded it into a video to be taken back for reference when the Criminal Investigation Division held a hearing to investigate Maley. Afterwards, reporters visited forensic doctor Wang, who stated that Yu Shengxiao had three wounds in total. One was on the top of his head, which was struck with an iron object, causing the scalp to rupture and bleed profusely, but the skull was not broken. One was between the fourth finger and the middle finger on his left hand, with a laceration. The back of the head was also injured, with bloodstains, as if he had been holding his head and trying to resist. The fatal wound was that a bullet entered from the eighth rib behind the left side and exited from the third rib in front of the right side, slanting upwards and injuring the heart and lungs. This was the cause of Yu Shengxiao's death.</p>

<h3>Today Commemorates Air Force Day: City Council Sends Telegram to Air Force Headquarters to Pay Respects</h3>

<p>National Defense is in the Air, Aviation Belongs to the Public</p>
<p>Chen Qingyun, Minister of the Overseas Department, wrote an article "National Defense is in the Air, Aviation Belongs to the Public" to commemorate Air Force Day, stating that although aviation construction is complicated, it only requires the cooperation of the entire country to overcome difficulties and promote its success. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, pledged to promote "aviation to save the country," we have learned from several lessons that "without air defense, there is no national defense." During the War of Resistance, we launched a campaign to donate money and aircraft. Compatriots at home and abroad enthusiastically contributed. Unfortunately, due to poor objective conditions and a severe shortage of materials, the economic construction of aviation has failed to achieve its expected goals. After the victory, due to the disruption of the communists, the objective environment has not improved. However, national defense cannot be without an air force, and it still relies on compatriots across the country to grasp the link of aviation construction and work hard.</p>
<p>Shi Bangfan, an executive member of the Shanghai Branch of the Aviation Construction Association, also wrote an article "A Review and Prospect of the Work of the Shanghai Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association," elaborating on the association's business in great detail.</p>
<h3>Printing and Dyeing Factory Owner Kidnapped: Two Monks Apply to the Court for Explanation</h3>

He accosted a young woman, Mrs. Zhang Chen, and asked her where she worked. She said that she was a domestic helper. Shen told her that the salary for a domestic helper was low. It would be better for him to introduce her to the Yongguo T-shirt factory in Jintong Village, Xujiahui Road, as a female worker, where she could earn a salary of more than 900,000 yuan per month. Mrs. Zhang was so happy that she agreed. They arranged to meet again at the park at 10:00 AM the next morning. At the appointed time, Shen took Mrs. Zhang to the above address and told her to wait a while at the factory gate. Shen walked in slowly, and after a short time, he came out, pretending to say that he had already negotiated. She can go to work in the factory the day after tomorrow morning. As they walked and talked, Shen saw that she was wearing two gold rings on her hand and falsely claimed that he wanted to go to his sister's house in Xihu Lane, Ximen Road. Could he borrow the gold ring for a while? At the same time, he issued two checks as collateral. Mrs. Zhang did not suspect him and agreed. After the separation, Mrs. Zhang asked someone to go to the bank to cash the checks, but found nothing, then she knew that she had been deceived. She urgently reported to the Lujiawan Police Sub-bureau, and ordered Inspector Jiang Zhaolong to investigate everywhere. As a result, Shen was arrested and taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Case of Parricide Attempt to Kill Mother: District Procuratorate Files Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Du Qun, from Shandong, attempted to rape his stepmother Du Zhang, but failed. He also tried to chop his biological mother, Du Xu, with a knife, an immoral act. Du Xu filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate. Although the defendant firmly denied it, Du Xu and She Zhang accused him in detail. Later, the two women applied to withdraw the complaint, and the defendant also submitted a statement expressing remorse. The District Procuratorate believed that the attempted rape was a crime that could only be prosecuted upon complaint, and allowed the withdrawal. For the part about attempting to kill his biological mother, a public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law.

<h3>"Miss International" Incident: Personnel Sent for Preliminary Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to conduct a preliminary investigation into the "Miss International Election Ball" in order to thoroughly investigate the matter.

<h3>Unemployed Workers Have Difficulties with Subsistence: Attempting to Subsidize Their Return to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee subsidizes unemployed workers in the rear area, and the monthly living expenses were previously allocated by the Executive Yuan on a monthly basis with relief flour. Since June of this year, the Executive Yuan has stopped providing it, so the committee has barely maintained it with the remaining relief flour, issuing one bag per person per month for their livelihood. However, the relief flour will also be exhausted by the end of this month. The committee, in view of the difficulty in providing living expenses, has decided that if unemployed workers staying at the center can afford to return to their hometowns, they can be subsidized to return. Each household will be issued 200,000 yuan in travel expenses, and three bags of large-mouth flour and one bag of small-mouth flour. However, because most workers' families are destitute and have no fields to cultivate after returning to their hometowns, they cannot make a living. Therefore, so far, only more than 100 people have been repatriated.</p>

<p>On a cool and breezy evening, I visited Colonel Shi Bangfan, the one-armed general. He recalled the past achievements of the air force and felt deeply moved. I took up my pen and listened to him talk vividly and touchingly.</p>
<p>Eternal Regret, Supreme Glory</p>
<p>General Shi is a veteran of the Air Force. During the January 28th Incident, he served as an instructor at Hangzhou Jianqiao. In order to deal with enemy planes, the fledgling air force sent him aloft in a single plane to fight the enemy planes. In an absolutely unfavorable situation, he shot down two enemy planes, and his left arm was hit by a bullet and disabled, leaving an eternal regret and supreme glory.</p>
<p>It is also pitiful to say that my country's air force was only initially established three months before the August 13th War of Resistance. Various different fighter planes were "show machines for birthday celebrations" donated by the public, with Shanghai citizens contributing the most. On this day ten years ago, he was the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Colonel in Nanjing. Flying Tiger General Chennault was the Senior Advisor, assisting Chief and Deputy Chief Zhou Zhirou and Mao Bangchu in planning to send bombers to attack the enemy fleet.</p>
<p>Remembering the Martyrs, Tears Fell</p>
<p>The enemy estimated that we only had Hawk-style bomber and fighter planes, which were not very fast. They sent Type 96 super-empty planes. On the evening of September 18, they broke into the capital city. He and Gao Zhihang had previously unloaded all the oil drums and bomb racks from the planes. Since the load was lightened, the speed increased greatly. As a result of the battle, the enemy planes were scattered and defeated.</p>
<p>What saddened him the most were several outstanding students, such as Gao Zhihang, who died in Zhoujiakou, Henan; Le Yiqin, Huang Zhengyu, Zhang Qi, and Yang Jihai also became martyrs one after another; Shen Chonghai was hit by a bullet in the night raid on Wusong and plunged into the enemy ship, destroying both the man and the machine, sacrificing heroically. When he said this, he took a sip of tea, remembering the deceased students, and tears fell.</p>
<p>A Family of Loyalty</p>
<p>During the eight years of the War of Resistance, air force talents emerged, and there was indeed considerable progress in technology and strategy, but the material conditions were insufficient, heavy industry was lacking, and scientific manufacturing equipment still needed to be improved. Technical talents still need to be trained more intensively. In short, the morale is strong, the materials are too poor, and a sound air force still requires us to work hard!</p>
<p>The general's grandfather, Shi Shengjun, was a commander in the Gengzi year. When the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded, he died defending Dagu Port. His father, Shi Shaolin, was the chief of staff of a certain military detachment. He opposed Hong Xian and died in Lutan County. The National Government issued a decree to commend him. His son, Jiazhong, 17 years old, is studying at the Sichuan Guanxian Air Force Youth School. When he mentioned himself, he was ashamed and only sacrificed a left arm. He is willing to use what he has learned in his life to serve the Air Force, promote air construction, and work hard for the country! (Zhu Jiajun)</p>

<h3>Huge Check Bounces: Salt Merchant Deceived by Colleagues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Zhifu, who runs a salt business, lives at No. 3, Lane 229, Jiangsu Road. On December 20th of last year, Wu Chengjie, a colleague from the same industry, borrowed 2,000 US dollars from him, stating that he would repay 3,000 US dollars in principal and interest by the end of July. In May of this year, Wu again told Wang: He will have a US dollar draft for 3,200 US dollars at the end of July. He hopes to borrow another 200 US dollars, and in the future, he will use this draft as repayment. Wang then borrowed him another 2.4 million legal tender, equivalent to 200 US dollars at the official rate. By the end of July, Wu had no such US dollars. He borrowed a check from the Nanjing Road branch of the Bank of Communications from Lu Qinli, with a face value of 120 million legal tender. Wu gave this check to Wang. When Wang went to collect the money on August 4th, the check was returned due to insufficient funds. Wang then realized he had been deceived and filed a fraud complaint with the Jing'an Temple Road Police Sub-bureau. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Jindou Case Investigation Completed: Collegiate Panel to Hear Case Tomorrow; Director Liu Visits Commander Xuan to Discuss Trial Procedures</h3>

Yesterday, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., the Jin Du Theater inspector Zhang Yonggen, tea attendant Gu Yongquan, Mei Longbao, a worker at Fuxing Auto Repair Shop (near Jin Du) at No. 429, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Cao Guangzhi, a resident of Kader Road No. 1121 who happened to pass by the scene of the conflict, Cai Hefu, the young owner of Cai Wenji Western Clothing Store across from Jin Du Theater, Ji Tingfu, an employee of the Youth Department Store, Jia Rongzhen, a police officer from the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau, and Liu Junfu, the section chief of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the "original instigator," were questioned. Except for Liu Junfu, who was instructed to be available at any time through the Public Works Bureau, the rest were dismissed. Section Chief Bao of the Prosecutor's Office stated that the investigation must be completed today, and a collegiate panel can be convened for a hearing tomorrow. In addition to Meng Qingtai and Xu Zengxiu, military judges from the Ministry of National Defense, Section Chief Bao, and Zeng Zhaoyi, director of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters, Liu Muzeng, the chief judge, also invited Commander Xuan to attend the court hearing, but it is said that Commander Yi has declined.</p>
<p>Focus of the Investigation</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed several citizens who were summoned to testify. According to reports, there were two main questions during the investigation: (1) Who fired the first shot? (2) Were the police completely unarmed? The former was difficult to determine because the conflict occurred at midnight, and the situation between the two sides gradually became tense. Bystanders all fled first, but they heard gunshots and could not identify who fired them. For the latter, the witnesses truthfully answered what they had witnessed.</p>
<p>Director Liu Muzeng visited Commander Xuan yesterday morning to discuss trial procedures and visited Fang Zhi, the director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, in the afternoon. Director Fang expressed his hope that the case would be concluded as soon as possible and that future emotional ties between the military police work could be strengthened.

<h3>Promoting the Jianqiao Spirit to Welcome the Eighth Air Force Day</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 12th] The Air Force Headquarters, with the Eighth Air Force Day approaching, has specially written an article on the historical program of "August 14th." The main purpose is to awaken the people of the country to work hard to suppress the rebellion and promote the fighting spirit of the Air Force. The main points are recorded as follows: "The Chinese Air Force has grown up in extremely difficult and arduous conditions. The Chinese Air Force will always be victorious. This victory began with the first great air battle in the skies of Jianqiao on "August 14th" in the 26th year of the Republic. Due to the glorious victory of the "August 14th" air battle, there were later two, three, and countless great air victories. The government authorities, in order to commemorate and promote this "August 14th" spirit, specifically designated August 14th as Chinese Air Force Day. Every year on this day, never forget. This year is the eighth "August 14th." Looking forward to the future of the country and recalling the deeds of the martyrs, one cannot help but feel moved.</p>
<p>China has been engaged in the anti-aggression war for eight years. Its purpose is to seek the independence and autonomy of the country and the nation. Relying on the concerted efforts of the military and civilians across the country and the spirit of the martyrs' sacrifice for justice, the War of Resistance finally achieved the final victory, and the country and the nation also gained a good opportunity for rehabilitation and construction. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the Communist bandits rioted everywhere, destroying transportation, destroying production institutions, and destroying the peace, unity, and revival of the country. Thinking silently about the hardships of the martyrs in starting their careers and their heroic sacrifices, especially our Air Force warriors have done their utmost in this sacred war of national liberation, giving their all until their death. Unexpectedly, the final victory that was exchanged for blood and flesh was trampled on by the Communist bandits to such an extreme. This is intolerable. In order not to be ashamed of our ancestors and not to let down the martyrs, we should all rise up and work hard to suppress the rebellious bandits, promote the Jianqiao spirit, commemorate "August 14th" with action, and praise "August 14th" with hard work."

<h3>Iron Troops, New Vitality: The 74th Division's Reorganization and Replenishment Work is Advancing Rapidly</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua, Nanjing, 11th] The Battle of Menglianggu was loyal, brave, and heroic, shaking China and foreign countries. It represented the soul of Chinese soldiers and the revolutionary spirit of China. Division Commander Zhang Lingfu and the collective suicide of his subordinates represented a spirit of sacrifice. How great it was.</p>
<p>Division Commander Qiu Weida (Sent by Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)</p>
<p>Visiting Division Commander Qiu in Chuxian</p>
<p>The military campaign to suppress bandits has undergone a major turning point due to the Battle of Menglianggu. In the experience of reviewing the battle results, we have strictly enforced discipline and changed our strategy. Today, central Shandong is being revealed, western Shandong is reporting victories, the "People's Liberation Army" is being annihilated, and Liu Bocheng's main force is being surrounded... These are all the consequences of the heroic sacrifice of the 74th Division. Although the bandit army destroyed the tangible essence of the Reorganized 74th Division, it has not in the slightest deprived my 74th Division of its intangible spirit of fearlessness. In the Langya Mountains and on Motian Ridge, countless soldiers are singing the roar of "We are Iron Troops" and forming a capable Chen Rong.</p>
<p>Reinvigorating the army to sweep the Central Plains, that is something we can predict.</p>
<p>The reporter made a special trip from Nanjing to Chuxian to visit General Qiu. On this day, he happened to be going to Lai'an for inspection. After waiting for an hour, he returned. As soon as he got out of the car, he shook the reporter's hand tightly. After sitting down in the office, I stared at Division Commander Qiu from time to time and then asked, "Division Commander Qiu, what are your thoughts on the Battle of Menglianggu of the 74th Division?" This question touched Division Commander Qiu's heart. He said to the reporter very sadly: "I share life and death with the 74th Division. Now that most of my superiors, colleagues, and subordinates have sacrificed, it really makes me want to cry. Today, I am shouldering the unfinished mission of the martyrs. I deeply feel apprehensive, but I believe that I have the perseverance, I have the determination, and I will definitely turn this vitality into iron troops to complete the unfinished will of the martyrs!"</p>
<p>"How is Division Commander Qiu handling the aftermath?"</p>
<p>"After the Battle of Menglianggu ended, I rushed to Linyi.</p>
<p>To handle the aftermath, collect the loyal remains, accommodate the escaped officers and soldiers, and rescue the accompanying family members. After moving to Dangshan, we handled the remains of the fallen soldiers, sent condolences, and personally went to various hospitals to comfort the wounded soldiers. The remains of senior generals have been found and coffined, and they have been transported back to their hometowns for burial or temporarily placed in selected locations. In order to commemorate the loyal souls, it has been decided to hold a memorial service on August 13th to comfort the loyal souls!"</p>
<p>"Is your division reorganized yet?"</p>
<p>"After we moved to Dangshan, the Ministry of National Defense ordered me to urgently recruit 10,000 new soldiers from the various division areas and Suqian regiment area in southern Henan, central Anhui, and southern Anhui to replenish the vacancies so that this glorious bandit suppression force could be restored as soon as possible. Therefore, I immediately dispatched cadres to form several</p>
<p>Recruitment teams to receive them separately. In less than two months, we completed the convergence of these cells. At this time, the officers and soldiers of this unit who recovered from their injuries also returned to the hospital. The new vitality and the old essence and blood have formed this new team. I believe that we can fight soon and we will definitely be able to wash away the scars of Menglianggu!" Division Commander Qiu told the reporter with such confidence and joy.</p>
<p>The reporter asked Division Commander Qiu about the training situation. Division Commander Qiu said that Langya Mountain is an excellent place, so I used it to train cadres. I</p>
<p>Personally train the first, second, and third officer teams and the seventh army team. In addition, there are also medical personnel training classes, communications personnel training classes, intelligence personnel training classes, and radio personnel training classes to meet the needs. Now this unit has completed the reorganization and replenishment work of × regiment, and after replenishing × regiment, it can achieve its original establishment. The reporter, in order to catch the "Victory" night train, could not talk to Chief of Staff Li for a long time, so he said goodbye to Division Commander Qiu. Division Commander Qiu said: "We will see you again in the Central Plains!" In the reporter's eardrums, this is a magnificent roar!</p>
<p>General Qiu Weida, the new division commander of the 74th Division, is a soldier with the genius of strategizing. He graduated from the Army University and has a thorough understanding of strategy and tactics. He has always assisted General Wang Yaowu in military affairs. In the unprecedented victory of the "Glorious Army" in western Hunan, he was the chief of staff of the Fourth Front Army at that time, and therefore, he was especially valued by Wang Yaowu. When accepting the surrender of the Beijing-Shanghai area, he was the commander of the 51st Division. After the reorganization of the National Army, he was promoted to deputy division commander of the Reorganized 74th Division. At this time, the situation in Shandong was tense, and Commander Wang Yaowu temporarily pulled him out to serve as the garrison commander of the Zibo area, the heart of Shandong. Unfortunately, the battle situation reversed, and Zibo was evacuated. In that emergency situation, he was able to transport dozens of locomotives and all the materials to Jinan. This time, he succeeded the division commander as deputy division commander, which is really the most appropriate choice. He is now working hard day and night to reorganize and train the troops in order to set off to suppress the bandits as soon as possible and avenge the martyrs who sacrificed in Menglianggu.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Eight Major Issues Regarding US Dollar Bond Mortgage Loans</h3>
<p>Regarding US dollar government bonds and treasury bills, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that they can be freely mortgaged, with the discount temporarily set at 70% of the face value. Afterwards, national banks and bureaus raised relevant questions and requested instructions from the Four Joint Offices. There are eight points: (1) How to regulate the object, use, term, and interest rate of mortgage loans? (2) Should US dollar government bonds be mortgaged for national currency at a ratio of 12,000 per unit? (3) Should the bonds used for mortgage be limited to those sold by the banks and bureaus themselves? (4) If US dollar bondholders apply to the banks and bureaus for mortgage loans in the name of private individuals or organizations, can they be accepted? (5) If bank and bureau employees purchase bonds, can they be allowed to mortgage them with their respective banks and bureaus for loans in case of urgent need? (6) If the banks and bureaus re-mortgage the US dollar bonds they have received with the national bank, can this be done? (7) If the subscription receipts issued by the banks and bureaus cannot be exchanged for formal bonds for the time being, can these subscription receipts be mortgaged for loans in the same way? (8) According to regulations, various loans must first be reviewed to determine whether the use of the loan is truly legitimate before being granted. If an application for a loan is made using these bonds as collateral, should the mortgage be accepted at any time? Regarding the above points, the Four Joint Offices have transferred them to the Ministry of Finance, which has approved the following separately: (1) Banks that undertake loans secured by US dollar government bonds and treasury bills should handle the object, use, term, interest rate, etc., in accordance with the regulations for loans. (2) When US dollar government bonds are used as collateral for loans, they should be calculated at 70% of the face value according to the Central Bank's exchange rate, and the loan should be made in national currency. (3) The bonds used as collateral for loans are not limited to those sold by the banks and bureaus themselves. (4) If US dollar bondholders apply to the banks and bureaus for mortgage loans, the banks and bureaus can handle them in accordance with the general loan regulations and may decide whether to accept them based on their own position. (5) Bank and bureau employees who purchase bonds are not allowed to apply to their respective banks and bureaus for mortgage loans in accordance with the general loan regulations. (6) Regarding the re-mortgage of the bonds received by the banks and bureaus with the national bank, the Ministry of Finance has previously issued a telegraphic circular No. 24626, requesting the Central Bank to consider the circumstances of the banks and money shops and, when necessary, to refer to the provisional discount for lending and re-mortgaging to facilitate turnover and benefit sales. (7) The subscription receipts issued by the banks and bureaus are only certificates for exchanging for formal bonds and should not be used as collateral for loans. However, in order to facilitate financing for bond purchasers, it is permissible for the banks and bureaus to jointly handle them. (8) The application for a loan by US dollar government bonds and treasury bill holders, using these bonds as collateral, is the same as item 4.</p>

<p>At 11:15, after No. 162 from the Guangdong gang pulled Yong Gong to a stop, buying interest was reinvigorated. Nos. 89, 4, 117, 232, and 36 advanced to 208 yuan. Nos. 160, 153, 31, 232, 76, and 186 successively closed out positions. The gang on the trading floor also had a strong intention to sell. Di Yong Yarn once fell back within the 200 yuan mark. After No. 177 strongly bought spot Yong Yarn, and No. 163 also maintained Di Yong Yarn, both closed at a price of 200 yuan at noon. Bids were peaceful after the close.

<h3>Floating Bulls Frequently Sell Off; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Start Strong but End Weak; Leading Fine Cloth Once Called Up to 400,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw no change in the opening yarn price of the Textile Construction Company. 20-count yarn was sold in large quantities for 9.5 million. Trading opened higher on the floor, then prices fell back due to floating bulls selling off. Actual sales remained sluggish.</p>
<p>The final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 16.05 million yuan, and 32-count was 13.3 million yuan, a step increase of 300,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse, however, fell by 100,000 yuan to 11 million yuan. Light Double Horse was 9.7 million yuan, squeezed up by 100,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn rose by 100,000 to 250,000 yuan. However, 20-count Tian Nvren, Zhong Shuang Earth, and 10-count Jinbao Xing, etc., remained sluggish.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw some purchases from Taiwan and Changsha merchants. Also, with the negotiated price of cotton yarn not reduced, market sentiment turned firmer, and the market trend was boosted once. However, by the noon close, actual sales on the street were stagnant, and there were also high-level sell-offs, so the market trend weakened again.</p>
<p>The final price of 12-pound leading fine cloth was 400,500 yuan, an increase of 22,000 yuan from the previous day. Wufu, Blue Chicken, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and extra-fine cloths also rose by 22,000 to 30,000 yuan. Other fine twills, jeans, and bleached cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth also rebounded by 5,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, coarse cloth prices continued to fall by 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 313 pieces. The manufacturers' purchase orders totaled 104.</p>
<h3>Current Cotton Market Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market's sentiment improved due to the rebound in cotton yarn prices, and the trend has stabilized. Trading was also slightly more active than the previous day. Yarn factories frequently showed interest, and traders also engaged in transactions with each other. However, with prices having fallen, merchants have already suffered significant losses, so those with ample funds are still reluctant to sell. Prices for delivery to factories were: Lingbao 20.65 million, Shashi 19.5 million. Prices for warehouse delivery were: Lingbao 20 million, 20.2 million, and on credit: 20.5 million, 20.65 million, Shashi 19 million, 19.2 million, and Huoji 15 million.

<h3>China Trust Bureau to Purchase New Tea Based on Cost Calculation</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is currently preparing to purchase new tea for the 36th year (of the Republic), with the purchasing principle determined to be based on cost calculation. The purchase of old tea from the 35th year has already begun, with purchase prices based on overseas prices. Qimen tea is set at 720,000 per case. Overseas prices are lower than domestic prices, so the purchase price is also lower. Now, the Central Trust Bureau, to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, will have the Tea Association submit a cost calculation report for the 36th year's new tea. After review and investigation by the bureau, a purchase price will be set with the addition of a legitimate profit, so the purchase price of new tea will be much higher than in the past. This year's tea production is greater than last year's. According to tea merchants, if the Central Trust Bureau sets a higher purchase price, they can profit, and production may further increase. Currently, tea destined for Shanghai can be mortgaged to the Farmers Bank. As of yesterday, the Farmers Bank had accepted mortgages on over 5,000 cases of tea.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the old tea of the 35th year has now been entirely purchased by the French company Yongxing, so the Central Trust Bureau has purchased very little.</p>
<p>Another report: Yesterday, the domestic tea market remained active but lacked overall movement, resulting in mediocre trading. Although sellers tried to raise prices, it was difficult to advance. By the close of the market, the trend was firm. As for export tea, due to scarce imports and exports, the entire day was quiet, generally similar to the previous day.</p>

<p>[Our Report] Recently, there were rumors that the authorities would abolish coal rationing and restore free purchase. A reporter specifically verified this with a responsible person at the Fuel Control Committee, who stated that they had not yet received any instructions from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to abolish fuel management. They pointed out that the current fuel rationing is due to the insufficient national coal production to meet the national consumption. In order to regulate supply and demand, the authorities make overall arrangements for transportation and distribution based on the depth of the relationship between various industries and the national economy and people's livelihood, and the urgency of needs, so as to minimize the severity of the coal shortage. Therefore, it seems impossible to abolish rationing before the national coal production situation returns to normal. The recent rumors of abolition may be due to the authorities' plan to organize order-based loans, which also included coal, leading to the misunderstanding that coal will resume free sales.</p>
<p>Another report: In order to enrich the source of coal supply, the Fuel Control Committee had promulgated the "Measures for Allowing Manufacturers to Purchase and Transport Coal on Their Own." However, the provisions in that article stipulated that each manufacturer could only purchase and transport 100 tons per month. Now, because that amount is too small and does not meet actual needs, the committee has submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to cancel the above restriction order. In the future, there will be no restrictions on the amount of coal purchased by coal merchants.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue Downward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 4,400 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets, but digestion was slow, and the market continued its downward trend. Japonica rice fell by 30,000 to 50,000 per step, and indica rice also fell by 60,000 to 70,000. White silver dollars were raised for further selling. New japonica rice temporarily lacked change.</p>
<p>Flour prices saw mixed ups and downs. Foreign flour sales were surprisingly strong, exceptionally brisk, and rose sharply by 10,000. Mill flour was mediocre, and miscellaneous brands of flour rebounded by a small 1,000. Bran sales in rural areas were very sluggish, initially firm but later weakening, with the situation looking soft, slightly weakening by 300 to 500. Soybean cake trading was normal. Taiwan had some interest, but rural villages were scarce, continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000. The source of soybeans was continuous, but interest was lukewarm, declining daily. New and old soybeans continued to plummet by 50,000 to 60,000 to 10,000.</p>
<p>Mung beans gradually declined, falling another 10,000. Adzuki beans settled. Broad beans saw slightly weak interest from customers and local traders, turning down by 30,000 to 50,000. Corn in the North Ocean was unchanged, falling by 10,000 per step. Kernel grains also fell wildly by 10,000. Sesame still lacked luster. Raw kernels from South China were discontinued. Local sales were sparse and sluggish, plummeting by varying amounts of 2 million, 3 million, or 4 million.</p>
<p>The oil market lacked transactions from Guangdong merchants, and shop interest was extremely low. Customers were hesitant to move forward, and the market continued to decline. Raw oil was clearly set but secretly stagnant, refined oil softened, soybean oil plummeted by 2 million to 3 million, and rapeseed oil also fell by 2 million to 3 million. Sesame oil also fell by 10,000 to 20,000.</p>
<p>Hunan Rice Prices Rise</p>
<p>[Our Report from Hengyang, 12th] With the opening of Hunan grain exports, grain prices have risen. Top-grade rice is now 150,000 per dan, setting a new high record for Hunan grain this year.</p>
<p>Siamese Rice Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The 18,000 tons of rice ordered by the Central Trust Bureau from Siam has now had 2,000 tons shipped to Shanghai, with the remainder continuously en route. All of it is expected to arrive by the end of this month. The bureau has also recently ordered a batch of foreign rice from American merchants, in a very large quantity. It will start shipping to Shanghai once both parties have signed the contract.</p>
<h3>White Coal Scarce and Prices Firm</h3>
<p>The coal market had previously seen transactions stall invisibly due to the truck drivers and coolies striking, but this has not been resolved for many days. Yesterday, work was resumed, and buying and selling moved accordingly. Due to handling costs, the arrival of white coal was not much. Although sales were in a dull month, the market was still firm. The transshipment price for Yuanhua Coal's chips at the ship's side for this month has been raised to 800,000. Coke had more stock, and prices were still stable. Bituminous coal plant sales were sluggish, and the market was weaker. The transshipment price of Chenxi Tong coal at the ship's side has entered the 1.2 million mark.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Allocation Dispute: Silk Weaving Industry Holds Consecutive Meetings Yesterday, Decides to Send 15 Representatives to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>The artificial silk allocation dispute between the silk weaving industry and the China Trust Bureau has now reached a deadlock. The industry association dispatched representatives Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, and others to visit Mayor Wu at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on the recent situation of the industry and inquire about the mayor's mediation results. According to the association, they have decided to send 15 representatives to Beijing tonight to petition the central authorities to order the China Trust Bureau to reduce the allocation price of artificial silk. The industry association also continued to hold a small group meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss matters related to the petition to Beijing.</p>
<p>Black Market Prices Rise</p>
<p>Because the China Trust Bureau will not temporarily reduce the allocation price of artificial silk, the black market has again announced price increases. However, silk fabric manufacturers still lack interest and have no transactions, otherwise, prices may soar even higher. Yesterday, Gaoshan Youguang, No. 120, quoted 24.56 million in the morning and 4.8 million in the afternoon. Dongyang quoted 5 million. Traders also remained on the sidelines, with no transactions.</p>
<p>Mill Spun Still Shows No Improvement</p>
<p>Various grades of 5-dan yarns all lacked transactions. More than ten dan lots of high-grade and medium-grade yarns were offered in the market yesterday. The former was priced at 27.5 million to 8 million, and the latter was priced at 26.5 million to 7 million, all with five- or six-day futures. The opening price for low-grade Qianjing goods was 15 million, 500,000 lower than the previous day. Prices for 28-point goods also weakened slightly. Anhui small factory silk was priced at 20 million.</p>
<p>Major Dealers Lift Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk fabrics saw major dealers lifting real silk quilt covers, 100,000 higher than the previous day. Huaqiang goods were traded at 10.05 million and 60,000 after the market opened. Due to multiple floating profits, some were sold, with the lowest price dropping to 9.98 million, but it then recovered. The final spot price was 10.05 million, and the price for the next day was 100,000. Dacheng goods rose 100,000 more than Huaqiang. Dacheng checkered crepe was offered at 34,000, and someone wanted 3,700, but the deal did not go through. There were very few Meiya quilt cover orders on the market. There were no transactions or quotations yesterday.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Arrived Foreign Cotton Ends on August 15th</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the China Trust Bureau, the application for the purchase of foreign cotton that has arrived will end on August 15th and will not be extended at that time. Regarding the purchase of this batch of foreign cotton, after review by the small group meeting on August 9th, the first batch of 25,000 bales, valued at over US$4.4 million, has been contracted for 20,000 bales, except for 5,000 bales, which require further instructions before ordering. As for the second batch of approximately 10,000 bales, it is still under review.</p>

<h3>Order-Based Loan Measures: Seeking Opinions from the Four Joint Offices</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The outline of the draft measures for order-based loans for daily necessities planned by the Four Joint Offices was published in this newspaper yesterday. It is learned that the authorities believe that order-based loans can be effective in securing materials, but whether to order all of the production volume of each industry is still under consideration. If it is implemented across the board, the following points must be considered: (1) a large outflow of funds, (2) stimulation of raw material prices, (3) impact on finished product costs, (4) causing the original funds of the industry to escape. If it is not a full-scale ordering, in order to take into account the production of each industry and enrich the materials, it seems appropriate to refer to the original loan methods for assistance. The Four Joint Offices are now soliciting opinions from the relevant competent authorities on the order-based loan measures. The content of the solicitation of opinions includes: ordering area, ordering period, product standards, delivery conditions, loan conditions, full ordering or partial ordering, the total amount of order-based loans required for each product, etc., so that after summarizing the opinions, a careful study will be made, and detailed rules for the implementation of the order-based loan measures will be formulated.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation 18-Year-Old Girl of Marriageable Age Stepmother Makes the Decision to Arrange a Marriage Dispute Over a Sale-Type Marriage</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: My friend, Miss A, is a woman. At the age of 18, her stepmother made the decision, through a matchmaker, to arrange a marriage with Mr. B, who lives in the same house. At that time, Miss A's consent was not obtained. Now, Miss A has another suitor, Mr. C, and intends to cancel the original marriage arrangement. There are several legal questions regarding this matter, please provide answers: (1) Is the marriage arrangement made by Miss A's stepmother on her behalf when she was a minor valid? Miss A is currently under the legal age, can she publish a notice in the newspaper to deny this marriage arrangement? (2) If Mr. B uses illegal means to threaten Mr. C and Miss A, how should they respond? (3) If Mr. B agrees to terminate the arrangement, how should they respond? (4) If Miss A proposes to terminate the arrangement, does she have to compensate the other party for losses, and how should the engagement gifts be returned? (5) Can Miss A disregard Mr. B's interference and get engaged to Mr. C directly? Reader Zhang Huaguo.</p>
<p>[This Column's Answer] (1) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, marriage arrangements should be made by the man and woman themselves, otherwise they are invalid. Miss A's stepmother made the marriage arrangement on her behalf without obtaining her consent, so this marriage arrangement is invalid and there is no need to publish a notice to deny it. (2) If Mr. B uses illegal means to threaten Miss A and Mr. C, if there is concrete evidence, he can be prosecuted for the crime of intimidation according to Article 346 of the Criminal Code. (3) Since this marriage arrangement is invalid, Mr. B has no right to interfere. (4) There is no need to compensate for losses. The engagement gifts should be returned by Miss A's stepmother. (5) If Miss A has reached adulthood, she can make a marriage arrangement with Mr. C, and Mr. B cannot interfere.</p>

<h3>On Telecommunications Construction in the Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>— Tao Yong</p>
<p>The National Economic Committee's reviewed and amended economic reform plan was discussed and passed by the State Council on August 1st, and telecommunications is also mentioned. According to Articles 5, 6, and 7 of Section IV of Item B in the reform plan, "Telegraphs are operated by the central government. Unpaid radio stations specifically needed by aviation and shipping in the sea and air can be set up independently under the management of the central government." "Long-distance telephone trunk lines and inter-provincial lines are constructed by the central government. Branch lines within each province are laid by the province, but they must not be parallel to the trunk lines or inter-provincial lines. County and township branch lines are laid by the township." "City telephones, except for those in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan and provincial municipalities, which are handled by the central government or publicly operated, the remaining counties are encouraged to be operated by the people, and regulations are stipulated to allow them to connect with long-distance telephones." In other words, telegraph and telephone services that are national or inter-provincial in nature are handled by the central government, and long-distance telephones within the scope of provinces and counties are constructed by local governments. County and township telephones and some special business radio stations and broadcasting stations are allowed to be operated by private enterprises under government management.</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a national and even international transportation construction that is closely related to the entire national defense, politics, economy, and people's livelihood, and should be operated by the state. However, China has a vast territory, and the scope of telecommunications is unusually broad, including telegraphs, long-distance telephones, city telephones, broadcasting stations, navigation and aviation communication, etc. If each and every one of them is operated by the state, not only will the strength be insufficient, but the time required will be difficult to estimate. Therefore, dividing them into state-run, publicly-run, and privately-run according to their nature and scope, so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, is a wise move. However, telecommunications is different from other industries and commerce. Except for a few businesses, such as broadcasting stations, which can be profitable, most of them are unprofitable. Take telephones as an example. According to pre-war statistics, the equipment cost per user, including telephone lines, in-house machines, and bureau buildings, is about US$80, while telephone revenue cannot be too heavy because it is a public utility. In addition to expenses, it can only pay the interest on loans. There is no place for the amortization of all loans and the depreciation of costs. Therefore, private operations are nominal but not real, and it is very difficult to seek universal development. Even publicly-run long-distance telephones only focus on politics and public security, and are not designed to facilitate the public. This has lost the meaning of telecommunications as a public utility. Therefore, if only the authority is separated and the government does not provide assistance and subsidies, it may still be difficult for publicly-run and privately-run telecommunications to develop. Secondly, most people in the interior of our country still do not know the use and benefits of telecommunications. Therefore, instilling telecommunications knowledge into the public is also an important plan for seeking the development of telecommunications. Finally, in order to reduce costs, the government should encourage the manufacture of telecommunications machinery so that the general public can enjoy it. Therefore, we hope that the government will pay attention to the above-mentioned three points of assistance, education, and manufacturing at the same time, so that state-run, publicly-run, and privately-run can develop in a balanced manner. In this way, China's telecommunications construction will have a brilliant future.</p>
<p>Caption for the photo: In order to facilitate users' inquiries and questions, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has set up public service counters at each demonstration business office. The scope of work includes (1) distributing telegram forms (2) writing telegrams on behalf of customers (3) managing public telephones in business offices (4) paying attention to the cleanliness and order outside the counters in business offices (5) instructing senders to use express, express, facsimile, and night letter telegrams and informing them of various telegram fees and procedures (6) reporting on the progress of express telegrams (7) managing lost property for senders to claim (8) instructing senders on how to simplify telegram procedures (9) calculating fees and checking for customers when there are calculation errors (10) others. The above picture shows the public service counter at the Fuzhou Road main business office.</p>
<h3>General Overview of This Bureau's Operations (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Li Tong</p>
<p>B. Telephone Section</p>
<p>1. Long-Distance Telephone</p>
<p>A. Wired</p>
<p>There are fifty-seven direct wired long-distance telephone circuits, reaching Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wu County, Hangzhou, Yin County, Wujin, Changshu, Hankou, Xuzhou, Wuhu, Taicang, Jiading, Jiaxing, Chuansha, Kunshan, Minhang, Baoshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, and twenty other locations. In addition, there are three wireless ultra-shortwave (Radio Link) circuits to Nanjing, three to Ying County, and over a hundred other relayed calling locations. Among these, calls between Shanghai and Nanjing are the busiest, hence fifteen pairs of circuits are allocated. Other major commercial ports along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line include seven circuits to Wu County, five to Wuxi, and nine to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>B. Wireless</p>
<p>There are two wireless telephone circuit positions, connecting to Chongqing, Taipei, Peiping, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Jinan, and other locations.  Tianjin, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Shenyang are planned for opening soon. Wireless circuits are limited by call duration and are sometimes affected by atmospheric interference, resulting in lower communication efficiency compared to wired lines.</p>
<p>C. Long-Distance Call Services</p>
<p>"Special Express" Telegram: Introduced at the end of last year. Users can connect within ten minutes of registration. Available locations are Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wu County, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Yin County, and seven other locations.</p>
<p>Message Relay Service: This bureau, recognizing the current shortage of lines, circuit congestion, and the frequent long waits for users after registration, which can cause delays in urgent matters, and considering the inconvenience for passengers at transportation hubs who need to communicate with other locations, has introduced a message relay service. Users only need to fill out the message relay registration form at the bureau's business office, providing the recipient's name, phone number, and the message to be delivered, or call 46277 or 46278 to the bureau's message relay registration desk, and the message will be reliably and quickly delivered to the recipient within two hours, providing convenience and suitability.</p>
<p>Urgent Call: An urgent call is second to a "special express" call, connecting within one hour of registration. During busy times, the maximum call limit is three attempts.</p>
<p>Ordinary Call: An ordinary call is second to an urgent call, connecting within two hours of registration.</p>
<p>Nighttime Discounted Calls: Due to the current shortage of lines, daytime circuits are more congested. Users with non-time-sensitive calls can call after 11 PM, when circuits are more open, and connection is faster. The price is discounted by 30% compared to daytime rates. Nighttime calling hours are from 11 PM to 7 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>2. Local Telephone</p>
<p>Due to pre-war foreign concessions in Shanghai, the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company was established in the former concession areas, with a contract signed with the Chinese government. Although the concessions were recovered after the victory, the foreign enterprise continued to exist. The scope of this bureau only covers Zhabei, Hongkou, Nanshi, the city center, and the suburban areas of Pudong, Longhua, Zhenru, Wusong, etc., i.e., the "102" telephone. The total equipment capacity is approximately 6,000 numbers. Due to the eight-year war of resistance, pre-war equipment was almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppet regimes. After the takeover, this bureau actively organized restoration, but due to a lack of equipment, expansion is difficult. A brief overview of the local telephone situation within the scope of this bureau is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) "02-60000 - 62599" are automatic telephones (Hongkou District)</p>
<p>(2) "02-70000 - 71999" are automatic telephones (Only 200 numbers are usable, the rest have not been repaired) (Nanshi District)</p>
<p>(3) "02-50000 - 50499" are automatic telephones (City Center District)</p>
<p>(4) "64000 - 64049" are magneto telephones (Zhenru District)</p>
<p>(5) "65000 - 65049" are magneto telephones (Wusong District)</p>
<p>(6) "66000 - 66059" are common battery telephones (Fuxing District)</p>
<p>(7) "74000 - 74119" are common battery telephones (Pudong District)</p>
<p>(8) "75000 - 75120" are common battery telephones (Longhua District)</p>
<p>(Business Section to be continued)</p>
<h3>Telephone Flowers</h3>
<p>A new telegram agency has been established inside the Chinese National Travel Service on Wukang Road (i.e., Kaishen Road) to facilitate telegrams for the people in the western district.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau employees have already begun to organize a labor union, guided by the bureau chief Yu Bingjian, as designated by the Ministry of Transportation. It is said that the inaugural meeting will be held soon.</p>
<p>The domestic telegram registration office at the Fuzhou Road headquarters has been moved to the branch office at Tianjin Road and Changzhi Road.</p>
<h3>The Process of Telegram Transmission</h3>
<p>The process from the time a sender hands a telegram to the business office of the sending bureau until the receiver receives it is probably not noticed by most people. Now, let's introduce the handling procedures for telegrams to the readers. Regarding the acceptance procedures at the business office, anyone who has sent a telegram will surely know. The telegram is first sent from the business office to the telegram room. After receiving it, the telegram room's dispatcher immediately assigns a route according to the destination, fills it in, gives it to the numbering clerk to add a machine-generated serial number, and sends it to the machine for encoding and transmission. After the receiving bureau receives it, it first gives it to the dispatcher to sort and check according to the destination, and there are the following two situations:</p>
<p>(1) If it is a telegram destined for that bureau, it is sent to the receiving telegram numbering clerk, who assigns a receiving telegram serial number, then gives it to the envelope preparation clerk to write the receiver's name and address on the envelope, with one copy sealed inside for internal use, and given to the delivery person to deliver to the receiver's address by district. The remaining copy is given to the reviewer to check for errors or misdelivery. After this procedure, this telegram is considered completed. Then, the collator organizes the serial numbers, binds them into a book, and sends them to the telegram archive room for filing, for reference when necessary.</p>
<p>(2) If it is a relayed telegram, for example, a telegram from this bureau to Yichang, because there is no direct circuit, it must be relayed through the Hankou bureau. After the intermediate bureau's machine receives it, it forwards it according to the destination. When the receiving bureau receives it, it also hands it over for delivery according to the receiving telegram handling procedures described above.</p>
<p>To be cautious, the telecommunications bureau requires all outgoing, incoming, and relayed telegrams to be reviewed by the checker after ten transmissions. If there are any errors, they are immediately corrected to remedy them. Also, to be speedy, time limits are set for the handling of all types of telegrams, and they should not be exceeded unless there are special reasons, to show thoughtful service. (Huang Yan)</p>
<h3>Talking Points on Telecommunications Knowledge (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jia'an</p>
<p>Lecture 2: First, Look at the Header</p>
<p>One of my younger brothers often omits the date when writing letters. People who receive his letters are often confused, not knowing when the letter was actually written. I have asked him to correct this more than once. In fact, my brother is also someone who works in the telegram industry. Perhaps he realizes that adding a date (usually using a date code or a date and time code) in a telegram text would cost one or two extra word fees. Therefore, subconsciously, he also omits the date when writing letters!</p>
<p>In fact, a shrewd recipient, even if the sender does not specify the date on the envelope or in the letter, can still see the date and time the sending bureau received the letter from the postmark stamped on the envelope by the post office. Similarly, a shrewd telegram recipient can also save on telegraph fees by knowing the sending date, time, and other records beneficial to the sender and receiver from the telegram header. If both the sender and receiver of a telegram understand how to read the telegram header, then not only can the sender and receiver use the facts to test the credibility of the telecommunications bureau's advertising, but also, because the telegram header already contains a faithful record of the sending date and time, there is no need to add a date code or a date and time code after the telegram text, saving at least one or two words of telegram fees per telegram.</p>
<p>The telegram header is at the top of the telegram, in the following format:</p>
<p>Among the various records in the telegram header, apart from the serial number, original number, and remarks, which are not of much direct relevance to the sender and receiver, the remaining five items, such as the telegram type, sending bureau name, number of words, sending date, and sending time, are necessary for the sender and receiver to understand for their own benefit. Because, from these records, you can see what type of telegram this is, you can check whether any words or sentences in the telegram have been missed by the telecommunications bureau during transmission, and you can also verify whether your telegram sending and receiving is indeed extremely fast.</p>
<p>Usually, domestic telegrams between private individuals generally fall into the following five categories:</p>
<p>(1) Special Express Telegram (Telegram Type is LTN) (2) Urgent Telegram (Telegram Type is D)</p>
<p>(3) Ordinary Telegram (Telegram Type is P) (4) Night Letter Telegram (Telegram Type is NLT)</p>
<p>(5) Social Telegram (Telegram Type is SLT) (To be continued)</p>
