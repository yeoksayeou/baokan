<h3>邵力子來滬</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕國民參政會秘書長邵力子，昨晨由京來滬，據語記者，此行純為料理私務，渠認改組政府在最短期內即可實現，部氏定今晚返京。</p>
<h3>當局對改組政府方針　將純取人才主義　青年黨今商擬府委名單</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕外交界息：美國務卿馬歇爾現在蘇京開會，最近並無來常催促國民政府改組，且其離華時之聲明，乃希望國民政府除國民黨人員而外，能容納各黨派及無黨派之自由人士，意在使社會各界傾向自由之領導份子，加入政府與國民黨合作，共同為中國憲政之準備工作努力，渡過此一艱苦之時期。當局此次改組政府，全由自動，其所熱望與國民黨合作努力者，故亦不致絕對以黨派為限，將純取人才主義。此為改組政府問題之最近趨勢。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕外交界年黨對參加政府之具體要求，頗注重於人事方面，自中央以至地方，自政府以至民意機關及敎育金融機構，均盼有所分配。靑年黨某中委有「千人運動」之號召，意謂參加之人數將達一千人之多。政府方面則大勢先商中樞政治機構之改組，其他尚談不到，故各方一時尚難獲得協議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕靑年黨曾琦，劉泗英，劉東岩，謝澄平，林立，張伯倫廿九日夜車赴滬，出席三十日靑年黨在滬召開之中常會，討論參加改組政府有關諸問題，名單可能即作場後決定。曾氏今對記者談：各方共同研討之施政繼領，業在該黨中紫會中通過，僅待及時公布。至靑年參加改組政府，仍盼政府能開放全面地方政權，俾各黨派人士能予參加。又曾氏稱：改組政府名單之公布，四月初旬可望實現。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨主席曾琦，昨晚自京來滬，今晨可到。陳啟天則於昨日由杭返滬，該黨中常會定今日下午三時舉行，商擬府委名單。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕民社徐傳霖，楊俊明等九人，廿九日晨自滬抵京，旋徐楊即往訪洪蘭友，午後出席憲政實施促進會，晚再訪吳鐵城長談。楊俊明對記者談：民社黨中常會對施政綱領業已通過，惟此綱領不能與改組政府事混為一談，故鄭重表示，民社黨目前尚朱就提名單及參加政府部份予以討論，更不能謂有何決定，外傳之詞，僅為推測而已</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷震秘書長昨見記者時，謂民社黨府委名單之未能提出，主要為人選上之考慮。對於外傳要求政院澈底改組及開放地方政權各節，槪加否認，並認為名單可能於最短期內提出。蔣勻田前夜未赴京，昨曾訪雷氏商談，亦表示名單之遲遲不能提出，全為人選問題，一俟名單決定後，即與雷氏同晉京。</p>
<h3>中央團部陳書記長　向全國青年廣播詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕靑年團中央團部　記長陳誠，於第四屆靑年節（廿九日）晚八時假中央慶播電合對全國靑年廣播，原詞如下：</p>
<p>今天是我們勝利還都種第一次的青年節與革命先烈紀念日，回憶三十六年前的今天，黃花崗諸烈士，不惜拋頭顫，　熱血，和滿淸專制政府搏關，這一役雖然沒有成功，但諸先烈不計成敗，不顧利害，前仆後繼，勇往直前的革命的精神，部已震動了全球，喚醒了全國同胞，故黃花崗一役，實是革命成功的始基，推翻滿淸的先聲。我們今日面對這偉大的紀念日，緬俊當年先烈的偉縝，於崇敬景仰之餘，允應互相勸勉，以發揚先烈犧性奮鬥的革命精神，繼績努力，完成建國的大業。</p>
<p>首先，我們對於目前時局，應該有一種明示的認識，自抗戰勝利以來，中國共產黨，即積極擴張地盤，實行武裝叛亂，中央一貫的方針，本在求和平統一與積極建設，以紓民因，因是有政治協商會議及軍事三人小組的成立，從事和平談判。乃中共復利用政治協商的掩護，擴充實力，企圖以武力奪取政權，最近非但拒絕和談，而且毀棄國民大會合法制定之憲法，不承認中央政府及其對外所訂立一切條約，允復實行全體動員，發動全面叛亂，如前此之攻擊徐州，威脅首都及侵製長春，妨碳政府之接收東北，均其較為顯著者。在此情形之下，中央以政治解決的希望，巳告幻滅，政府　　無法再行忍讓拖延，遂不得口　　　　　中國的共產黨，實際上是一個暴動的賣國集圍，而不能再視同如各國的普通合法的政黨，除非中共能翻然悔悟，自動停止暴動叛亂，解除武裝，否則自非將其澈底解決不可，蓋非如此，即無法掃除和平的障礙，完成建國的使命，這一點是首先要希望我全國靑年特別認識明確的。</p>
<p>其次，認識既明確，我們尚須進一步研究中央的　亂有無把握，這只要看中共已日趨於自取滅亡的道路，即不難想見。藍中共所做的，不僅是違反國家民族利益的行為，而且是出賣國家民族的勾當，結果自必為全國人民所共棄，這是毫無疑義的，而且共匪那種殘酷暴虐的行為，已惹起了民衆異常的厭惡痛恨，已脫離了全國民眾，我們知道，任何力量決不能離開民眾而生存，古今中外，理無二致。共匪專以殘殺相威脅，到處「鬥爭」，「淸算」，人民早已痛心疾首，願與偕亡，所以人民到處歡迎國軍，協助國軍，而廣大靑年自動參加從軍殺賊者亦日多，最近之能迅速收復共匪的老巢延安，這就是軍民合作的結果。另一方面，共產黨的軍心的渙散，也是其失敗原因之一，從前許多靑年所以願參加八路軍，為的是抗戰，動機本極純潔，及到現在，發覺已被迫當匪，後悔無及，故只要有機可乘，他們即莫不紛紛向國軍投誠，雖以共匪的淫威，亦不能制止，這可見共匪今日已變成了眾叛親離，不久即將土崩瓦解的了，故我們戡平央共的叛亂，實在是不成問題的。</p>
<p>第三，我們目前努力的方向，除了積極戡亂救民而外，還要切實努力，實行民權主義與民生主義，完成建國任務。國民革命的目的，在實行三民主義，即實現民族主義的社會制度，民權主義的政治制度，民生主義的經濟制度，以建立一個民有·民治·民享的新中國。抗戰勝利以後，我們認為，民族主義的實行，已經有了相當的成就，而民權主義，自去年國民大會圓滿閉幕，憲法公布後，我們認為民權主義的實行，雖具有良好的基礎，但尚待我們努力去實現。至於馬生主義，除遵照國父遣敎，實行平均地權與節制資本外，而目前最切要的，則在從事生產建設，我們全國靑年，於此允應注意生產技術的改進與努力科學的研究，以改變過去那種士大夫「學優則仕」的陳腐思想，消滅過去那種智識與生產脫節，手和腦分離的不良現象。切實養成手腦並用的　全的知識青年，以便投身到國家生產建造的各部門去，做飛員，做工程師，做小學敎員，做邊疆屯墾員，做鄉村自治員，担當那最黯淡，最基曆，最辛苦，最危險的工作，而後一個三民主義的新中國，才能在我們的手　迅速實現。</p>
<p>全國胥年們，革命的道路是曲折崎學的，但決不能阻止我們的前進，建國的事業，是艱鉅繁畫的，但決不能沮喪我們的志氣，只要我們認淸革命環境，抱定革命信心，發揮革命精神，則革命建國的時代任務，必能在我們手中圓滿建成。</p>
<h3>職業團體代表數百人　昨向立法院請願　立委選舉罷免法草案繼續討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿大日電〕立院廿九日晨繼續討論立委選舉罷免法草案，孫科主席，今日爭執最烈者，仍為名額問題，傅統先根據憲法建議增加內地生活習慣特殊國民一款，孫院長不以為然，認各種敎民若皆參加，則「立院勢將變成敎民大會」，欲謀建立一現代國家，勢非將此種觀念打破不可。孫九錄亦認各人若皆為其本身而凈名額問題將永無解決之日，希望咸能抱客觀態度，冷靜討論，繼即舉行表決，決議蒙古代表名額由原案十五人增至廿二八，西藏代表八人增至十人，邊疆民族代表由五人增至六人，僑胞代表由十六增至十九人。討論職業代表名額時，劉不同指出，實施憲政係「還政於民並非還政於職業」，八百萬職業代表即能選，出五十六人，不能謂少。鍾天心發言，認職業代表旣自稱為「優秀份子」，儘可於地區中競討論婦女代表應佔比例，孫院長夫人適於是時趕到，女立委聲勢起發言，若干男立委據理大爭，委揮手示意，扮能出馬相助，決議仍維原案，即各款立委名額十名以下者，婦女當選名額定為一名，超過十名者，每滿十名應有婦女當選名額一名，討論至此，職業代表二百餘名持旗來院請願，由劉克儁，林彬代表接見，婉詞勸慰，院中繼續討論，陳顧遠提出大選舉區辦法，孫科等認日前議定之辦法僅為技術上分區不當，原則上幷無不合，若採用大選舉區制，將來罷免時必生困難，嗣決議下午休會，由憲法法規委會對此問題加以檢討，再於卅日會中提出。</p>

<p>（十）糧政一，自卅六年度起，各省市徵借糧食，一律停辦，以輕人民負担。其歷年借糧，應還本息，由中央參酌到期時各地糧價核定折率，以法幣撥還，不再抵繳田賦，以便瀋償。二，卅六年度各省市田賦，仍暫行徵收實物，以應國家需要，但糧產不體，交通不便地區，折徵法幣，其折徵地區及折徽標準，由糧食部查酌情形，分別核定。三，田賦收徽所得實物，其應屬省市縣地方所得部份，照鄰近微幣地區折徵標準，由中央撥款收購，其附近徵幣之省縣公糧，仍歸地方運用，不予收購，以利軍食之統籌，兼顧地方之支應。四，徵幣縣市田糧機關一律裁撤，其事務歸縣市政府辦理，微實縣市及省級田繼機關仍予保留，其經費完全由中央負担。五，常平倉制度，亟須建立，長江流域各重要地點，必須於本年度內完成初步建倉儲糧計劃，地方積谷亦應加強推動，普遍實施，以厚儲備。六，中國農民銀行對於農倉儲押農產運銷業務，應積極推廣，期以金融力量，協同政府扶助生產，控制糧源，　劑盈虛。</p>
<p>（十一）引導游資納入正軌　當前經濟最大之病態，即為游資集中一隅，競為投機，游資所向，風浪隨興，欲使經濟入於正常狀態，一面需要根本　策，一面首先克服游資之作崇，故引導游資參加生產，乃當前切要之圖，其辦法：一，國家銀行配合生產建設計劃，對於正當企業，予以低利之貸款及保障，迅速確實，使正當企業</p>
<p>（十二）吸收國外資本加強生產建設一，政府應以優惠方式，歡迎國外資本，以助國內工業之發展。二，若干種類工業，並可與外資合作經營。三，便利僑匯，優予公平匯率，並獎勵保障僑民投資，予以興辦國內各種工業之便利。四，登記國民存放國外之外匯資產，使之用於國內生產建設。</p>

<p>（十四）嚴懲以政治力量便利私人企業之行為官商不分，假公濟私，良好之經濟政策，可以變質，社會上有一部份私人企業，受特殊之待遇，則正當之民間工商業皆受摧殘，此為施行經濟政策有效之先決條件，必須嚴格執行。</p>
<p>（十五）健全經濟組織為謀政府與人民之合作，使經濟政策推行盡利，誤濟財政金融，息息相通，為一整體，必須照顧全局，通盤打算。以往行政院各部各自為政，而最為經濟委員會等同虛設，民間對經濟政策之反應“亦無由溝通表達，為挽救此弊，其辦法：一，政府應健全仝國經濟委員會之組織，負設計督導，實行經濟政策之實任。二，一社會方面應發動廣大之經濟建設運動，提高民間對經濟建設之了解與興趣，並以官民協作之力量，排除經濟建設之困難。（完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>現階段的物價評議會</h3>
<p>物價許議會之組織，業經市政會議通過，不日便將成立了。勝利以來，關於此項組織之變更，迄今已為第三次。第一次，在前年冬季，第二次在去年夏季，此次屬第三次。考其組織，核其職權，顯有日趨嚴密之象。</p>
<p>因為第一·二次的組織，並沒有國家法令的根據，尤其是第一次的時候，連違反議價的處分辦法，也沒有合法的援用，在執行時，當然十分困難。所以開了一二次會議，便不見什麽下文了</p>
<p>第二次，連續施行到現在，雖沒有赫赫之功，却不能說牠毫無效果。這因為（一）去夏抑平米價時，市府的緊急措置，確盡了最大的努力，一面極力平價，一面又不斷地實施拋售，並非徒托空言。（二）取締違反限價議價條例，又重復加以援用了。（三）重要各業如糧食，油，糖，煤等分別組織，分別議價，比較來得切實。所以在物價波動，漲風漸熾的時侯，及時地適用這個辦法，，狠收到相當緩和的功效。</p>
<p>至於此次重行改組，係以經濟緊急措施方案（四）關於物價工資事項為出發點，以取締違反限價議價條例，及評議物價實施方案為依據。法律上的基礙，既十分堅強，而與以上兩决的辦法，還有許多不同之點，如下：</p>
<p>（一）此次是全國性的辦他，並非現行的地方臨時措施可比。（二）其議價之物品，確定為「主要民生日用必需品」，其他概置不論，其種類由地方政府體察當地情形，指定公告之。（三）手續嚴密，有初議與複議的規定。（四）處分辦法，明定依照取締違反限價議價條例辦理。（五）搆成分子，除掉主管機關和工商同業外，還有民意，治安等械關的代表，陣容比較堅強。（六）評議會的職權，除評價外，還有「協助違反議價之行為」這一款，那末，坐而言之外，還負有起而行的責任。</p>
<p>總而言之，這項新組織，其職權，範圍等項，均較為明確，其內容亦較為充實。所以施行起來，預料當比現在及過去為進步。不過還有幾個問題，事前尚值得檢討一下，列舉如下：</p>
<p>一·事樣上海為我國第一工商大埠，情形較為複雜。所以在事權上，往往政出多門，不易收統一之效。在商民，不得不分頭應付，每每有無所適從之戚。例如紗布兩項，過去社會局亦嘗辦理議價。不過本埠，主其事的，還有舫織管理委員會，人造絲是歸中央信託局標售的。按照現實情形，似乎紗布價格，已由全國物價評議會直接核定。而汽油媒油等，亦另有特殊情形。這種分歧與複雜的狀態，應吾設法統一，和怎樣才能統一，這是應當加以研究的。</p>
<p>二·調查取經違反限價議價條例第五條規定：「關於限價議價有無違反情事，在設有警察機關之地，由警察機關負責調查，」這和評議會協助檢舉這一款，已覺不十分符合。而且評議物價實施辦法第五條和取締違反限價議價條例第三條，既規定主管機關，在院轄市為社會局，而社會局乃無單獨或會同調查的明文。同時，在滬負靑調查的，又不止警察局和社會局，有時，且不止地方機關。為實施調查的順利起見，為减少商民的疑懼和麻煩起見，這問題，更有加以澈底澄淸的必要。</p>
<p>三。重新議價評議物價實施辦法第十三條：物品成本發生劇烈變動，有評定新價之必要時，得重新議價。但未經議定核定前，不得加價。這項規定，當然是十分合理的。不過物品成本，現在很容易發生劇烈變動，而按照過去作風，新價的評定，往往趕不上時價，以至造成黑市，擾亂市面，並使一部分的所謂奸商，囤商，投機商，成了犧牲品。同時，議價跟隨黑市，黑市領導議價？也失去了議價的尊嚴。這種事實，共見共聞，實在不勝遺憾。在新議價制度實施以後，我們不願再見此類覆轍，再而三地重新導演出來。其要在物品成本的確劇烈變動時，有關商入，允其是各該業的領袖們，不妨檢齊證件，坦白地據實向評議會報告，申請重新評議，不要偷偷模模，先自做開黑市。而評議會也應根據事實，予以同情的和合理的考慮。不要扳起面孔，專打官話，致助長公開的黑市。</p>
<p>四·依法檢舉凡是違反核定之議價者，人人可以檢舉。這是法所明定的，但照取締遠反限價議價條例第四條，『凡檢舉人檢舉第二條所列各款之違反限價議價案件，應有足資證明之物，或其他文件』。那末，凡是空言畢發，或匿名誣告之類，依法可以不理。尋繹立法用意，當然在於保隙善良，使勿受無辜的寃抑，與無妄的損失。設想極為周到。這一點，與安寗秩序及法治精神，關係極重，希望大家尊重。好得評議會負有協助檢舉的責任，如果有證物不全！或尚有疑義的檢舉案件，不妨先行交會審查，以期母枉母縱，獲致公允的措置。</p>
<p>經濟緊急措施方案的實施，以穩定物價為核心，而穩定物價，却以實施評議為手段，此次新評議會的任務，特別重大，非已往與現在可比，所以略抒所見，供大眾探討。無仰賴高利貸款之必要·二，規定利率之最高額，超過規定之高利貸，不予保障，並懲罰之。三，在過渡時期，國家銀行毋妨以最高之利息，吸收游資，轉用於生產，所存放之利息差額，政府自行貼補之。四，准許人民以黃金向中央銀行按牌價請購外匯，為購覺許可進口物品之用，並准以黃金為優先購買政府出售國營生產事業及敵偽產業之用。五，政府指定國家銀行舉辦黃金儲蓄存款或發生金公債，均優給利息，並予保障，特組監理委員會監督之。六，取締投機，操縱，建立健全合理之證券市場。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾向外長會建議　三大難題應速解決　次要事項提交特委會研究</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科一廿九日電〕權威方面今日探悉：美國務卿馬歇爾決定迫使四國外長會議對德國難題早日攤牌，俾可獲知蘇聯願意根據何種基礎成立協主議，此即昨晚馬氏提案幕後之策略，欲求確保未來之討論限於渠所謂主要問題，並劃定四月二日爲解決德國經濟統一，臨時政府，及工業賠償水準等僵局之「截止期」。按照馬氏策略，料將在會議進行時繼續提出其他截止期。倘若仍鮮成就，馬氏或將採取行動，中止談判，而於四月中旬歸國。如其前途光明，能有積極式作，則渠願再留駐相當時日。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿八日電〕四國外長今日討論調整委會對於外長會議業已獲致協議與未經成立協議各點所提出之報吿書，馬歇爾提議在此項報吿書中，提出三類基本問題，其他决要問題則暫攔置不論。所謂三類基本問題者，即（一）德國之經濟統一；（二）賠款問題及修正德工業水準；（三）德國臨時政府之方式與範圍。至於其他决要問題（如解除德國武裝，肅淸納粹及流亡人民等問題）則應交付一特委會討論，命其於四月二日提出報吿書，並擬定所當授予盟管會之指令。英洛托夫對於馬帥之建議，表示同意，但主張賠款問題，應併入第一類，並將决要問題解除德武裝問題列入第四類。四外長會議最後乃決定在明日會議時，進行下列四項工作：（一）決定調整委會報吿書所擬加以討論各點；（二）決定調整委會報吿書中所擬交付專家委會討論之各點；（三）規定專家委會討論各點之期限；（四）討論第三類問題中之任何一項，大抵爲德國經濟統一問題或賠款問題。</p>
<h3>蘇重視賠款問題　外長會議成敗關鍵所繫</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿九日電〕蘇聯曾在外長會議中正式提出警吿稱，除非蘇聯對德國之賠款要求能獲滿足，則會議中不可能有建於其他基礎上之任何協議，然蘇聯同時透露對賠款之要求，亦願作若干讓步。此爲調整委員會報吿中所透露者，該報告在星期五向外長會議提出，將在今日下午或星期一加以討論。顯然賠款問題爲整個德國問題之重點，不特會議之是否能得成功，且對德國問題之能否早日獲得協議，均將視此爲轉移。</p>
<p>蘇聯對賠款問題之主要文件爲：（一）蘇聯在調整報吿中之聲一明，「賠款之一部份應由目前之生產抵付」。（二）蘇外次維辛斯基在星期四·五調整委會中所發表之聲明，渠稱，蘇聯認爲賠款問題「極端重要」者，蘇代表以爲經濟問題各原則與賠款問題之關係最爲密切。</p>
<p>另一蘇聯文件與賠款問題有關者稱，蘇聯認爲德國出口貿易所獲之利潤，除購買能使德國自足自給之進口貨外，應賠款物資生產之進口貨物。蘇聯斷然反對英美所提以一部份出口利潤，用以彌補德西部以前之虧欠。同時據悉，因德國在奧境財產之定義未得一致，馬歇爾將拒絕蘇聯關於賠款之建議云。</p>
<h3>奧和約經濟條款五小點成立協議</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿八日電〕外長代表今日已就具和的經濟條款之五小點成立協議，惟就其餘四點，包括交還聯合國境內奧國財產之點，則未有協議成立。外長代表此外並已聆取政治委會關於奧境流亡人民問題之報吿。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿八日電〕外長代表會議負責處理德國問題之一組，定於明日聽取盟國對德賠償委員會主席魯夫陳述意見。必要時並將由四國外長會議聽取其意見。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿九日電〕澳洲前曾建議須俟對日和的簽訂之後，美國方可開始託管太平洋上日屬各島。安理會本日舉行會議時，此一建議已由澳洲自動撤消。另悉：安理會定於四月二日重行會議云。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫發言抨擊土耳其</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿八日電〕外長會議本日討論和會之組織問題時，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫譴責土耳其在確知德國將戰敗之時，始向之宣戰一事。略謂，土耳其戰時曾協助德國，幷從中取利。此係社魯門總統宣佈援助希土二國以抵禦共產至義一項計劃後，莫洛托夫第一次抨擊土國之言論。</p>
<h3>蘇願經濟援英</h3>
<p>史達林曾向貝文表示</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿八日電〕據稱：史達林昨在克里姆林宮與英外相貝文接談時，曾表示蘇聯願在經濟上援助英國。</p>
<h3>義羅等五國和約英下院二讀通過</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕英下院本日二讀通過對義羅匈保芬五軸心附庸國和的，國務大臣麥克尼爾宣稱，對軸心附庸和約獲得批准，象徵對於恢復歐洲各國間正常國際關係之初步步驟。</p>
<h3>海爾賽演說　力主維持強大海軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十九日廣播：美海軍上將海爾賽今日發表重要演詞，據稱裁軍在過去已吿失敗，美國必須維持世界上最堅強之海軍。未來之大戰，可能在閃電速度下來臨，對於此點，我人已知之甚稔，珍珠港之慘痛敎訓，許多人均已遺忘，且因循坐誤，勢將造成珍珠港事件之重演云。</p>
<h3>魯爾區德人十萬舉行飢饉大示威　英方稱顯含有政治背景</h3>
<p>〔路透社杜塞爾道夫廿八日電〕男女老幼十萬人，今日在此問公園舉行戰爭結束以來魯爾區最大規模之飢饉示威，所持標語有「無食物，不工作」，「不要讓我們的孩子餓死」等。羣衆在遊行時，並將英軍用車數輛推翻，英國新聞記者所乘之軍用車，亦遭人民投擲石塊，當地工會並通令工人總罷工一天，全市交通均吿停頓，工廠亦均停閉。自侵晨起，即有大批工人主婦兒童之行列出現街頭，至十一時許，續至者猶紛至沓來，沿途遇有英兵即報以惡聲，示威者並在公園入口處停集卡車多輛，阻止英軍車之通過。在示威之行列中並有馬匹及馬車參加。杜塞爾道夫工聯委會主席在公園中向羣衆廣播，謂工會在目前之悲局得以克服，並引起世界人士之良心以前，決不休止。另一演說者高呼「在不獲更多食物前決不工作」，引起全場歡呼。愛森城今晨亦有較小規模之示威，魯爾區其他城市亦有怠工示威之事，各地之示威均謹守秩序。</p>
<p>〔路透社杜塞爾道夫廿八日電〕英高級官員稱，魯爾區之飢饉示威及罷工，有政治背景，意在影響莫斯科之外長會議，若無糧食危機固不致發生此等事件。但主動者則復利用此等局勢，以引起莫斯科會議更多之注意。魯爾區目前之事件，顯然非納粹份子所策動云。</p>
<h3>波拉特臨街表示決使越加入聯邦</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕法新任駐越南高級專員波拉特即將啓程前往越南履新，行前致函總理賴瑪迪，略謂：余當在越南努力爲法蘭西聯邦奠定基礎，而使越南人民自由加入法蘭西聯邦。其唯一之目的，乃在發展各自之文化，增進幸福而獲得安全」。賴瑪迪當即覆函祝其成功云。</p>
<h3>聯全國裁軍委會席上　郭泰祺發表演說　力主締造和平應雙管齊下</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿八日電〕中國代表郭泰祺今日在聯合國通俗軍備裁减小組委員會席上，警吿聯合國締造和平工作不應逐步爲之，主張世界裁軍及世界安全應同時並進，始能收相輔爲功之效，略謂：聯合國應即完成其軍事委員會締造和平之努力，以使原子能用諸和平途徑及廢除通俗軍備，裁軍機關應設立二主要小組委會，其一負責防止違犯栽减軍備之事件，另一致力於裁减陸海空軍或軍費等工作，此因英美與蘇聯對裁軍問題，意見相左，郭氏特提出此項主張，以盡其調解任務。按西方國家乃主張裁减軍備須待發揮聯合國警衛力量及加强其維持和平之能力後，始能付諸實行，而蘇聯則主張世界軍備應一先予廢除。</p>
<h3>奧斯汀闡明美援希眞義　蘇代表暫不作答　謂須有充份時間予以考慮</h3>
<p>〔路透紐約成功湖廿八日電〕正當美代表奧斯汀擬向安全理事會提出美國關於希臘問題之意見時，蘇代表葛羅米柯突然起立反對美國發表宣言，指出該項宣言，不在安理會議程所列希臘問題之範圍以內，應視爲新提案，另行規定日期討論。經與主席略事商榷程序手續後，奧斯汀仍起立發言，正式請聯合國機構批准美國之援助希土，採取積極步驟，以保護任何國家受侵略之威脅，並在希臘北疆設立永久的邊界「監察團」。當奧斯汀致辭畢，全塲沉寂緊張，目光齊集葛羅米柯，靜待其如何答覆。惟葛氏僅曰：「余甫聞美國對於一個重要問題所發表之重要宣言，須予以充分研究，當於下次會議中提出意見」，下决會議定四月七日舉行。至是，各代表恢復討論美國要求代管太平洋日本舊委任統治各島一案.印度·澳洲·菲律賓·加拿大與挪威贊同美國提議，紐西蘭表示仍欲等待對日和的之簽字。最後決定休會至下星期三再行討論。</p>
<p>蘇或將採取新強硬政策</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿八日電〕蘇聯目前在安理會運用否決權，若干方面認爲此乃蘇聯採取新强硬政策，及不容理事會欺凌蘇聯勢力範圍內各國之先聲。蘇聯此次否決英國對阿爾巴尼亞在科佛海峽敷設水雷之控訴，爲其否決權之第十次運用，但在六個多月以來則爲第一次。同時，蘇聯拒絕參加性質重要之託管理事會會議，以及蘇聯代表葛羅米柯在原子管制委員會中不屈不撓堅持考慮少數派贊同之蘇聯提案，在在足以加重一穌聯强硬政策之情景。</p>
<h3>美援助希土　一部份議員反對</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕指摘社魯門總統援助希土計劃之國會人士今日集中攻擊，力謀將四億美元內土耳其一部份縱不取消，亦當削减。民主黨參議員瓊森吿記者稱：「支持地中海區對抗共產主義一案或將引起戰爭，給予土耳其以任何援助，余擬全力反對。余雙成完全撇開土耳其。按照提案內容，希臘不過一種甜餌，藉以誘使國會援助土耳其防止蘇聯侵入韃靼尼爾海陝。余贊成救濟希臘人民，但不贊成在軍事上援助希臘現政府或土耳其」。據助理國務卿克萊頓稱：撥充援助土耳其加强並維持其軍隊之款項的一億五千萬美元。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕美駐希經濟代表團長潘德頃在衆院外委會中要求該會批准四億元援助希土兩國之計劃，蓋希臘現正在借債度日。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕參院外委會主席范登堡宣布：參院定四月七日辯論美國援助希土兩國案。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕國會現擬於耶穌復活節休假，因之，四　元援助希臘土耳其案，在四月十五日以前恐難有最後表決，三億五千萬元救濟中國，義大利，希臘，匈牙利，奧地利及波蘭案，亦將暫時攔淺。此外，五億五千萬元救濟美軍佔領區案，衆議院下星期表決時，恐亦難　法定人數。</p>
<h3>美衆院准撥三億救濟美軍各佔區　霍奇猛烈抨擊韓北蘇軍</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕衆院度支委員會今日批准美軍各佔領區緊急救濟經費三億美元，內日本佔一億四千四百萬元，朝鮮六千八百萬元，德國六千七百萬元，餘給奧地利與義大利。該會聽取意見時，朝鮮南部美軍司令霍奇曾對鮮聯多所譴責，據稱，朝鮮美蘇兩軍佔領區間現爲一「絕對帷幕」所隔絕，由報吿獲悉蘇方在韓北擁有五十萬「强微」軍隊。共和黨衆議員基甫問：「未識朝南改善與建設工作一旦完成，蘇聯訓練之五十萬朝鮮軍是吾將開拔南下，佔領全國」。霍氏答稱：「此事可能發生，余與足下實具同感。」陸軍部次長裴德遜槪述各佔領區救濟程序稱，「吾人茍不扶養此輩人民，勢必陷於混亂不安，成爲共產主義最良好之繁殖塲所。務請注意吾人在全世界各地正與共產主義競爭中，且係極眞切之競爭。」</p>
<h3>蒙巴頓召開新德里會議</h3>
<p>甘地及各省長均將參加</p>
<p>〔合衆社新德里廿八日電〕據悉：印督蒙巴頓業已邀請所有印度省長，包括赫德雷嚼士，於四月中旬參加新德里會議。甘地亦已接受蒙巴頓之邀請，將於三十一日抵此，下月四日返帕塔那。</p>
<p>〔合衆社吉哈那巴德廿八日電〕聖雄甘地頃詳述蒙巴頓在就任時所言英軍撤退印度一節稱：余相信英國對退出印度一事，具有誠意。</p>
<h3>波蘭國防次長遭暗殺殞命</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華沙廿九日電〕頃悉，波蘭國防部次長即西內戰時代之國際義勇軍總司令史　齊斯基將軍，昨日在波蘇邊界附近被烏克蘭恐怖黨所暗殺。</p>
<h3>美共黨聽命莫斯科企圖推翻美國政府　反美活動調查委會報告</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：衆院反美活動調查委員會頃向國會提出二萬餘字之報吿，正式指責美國共產黨直接受莫斯科命令，企圖推翻美國政府，並謂美國共產黨之活動，僅爲全世界執行莫斯科共黨執行委員會命令之六十七個集團之一。委員會主席湯麥斯謂：該項報吿之目的，在使國會及民衆咸知美國共產黨乃莫斯科之第五縱隊。該委員會曾連續舉行會議，討論制止共黨活動或不承認該黨合法地位之法律。該報吿對於處置共產黨並未建議任何方法，但可靠方面謂：該委員會放棄不承共產黨合法地位之見解，因此舉將使共黨活動變爲地下工作，更難捉摸，且此舉是否合乎憲法精神，亦成問題云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：加拿大國防部長克拉克斯頓發表談話，指責加拿大共產黨執行蘇聯命令，「不忠於加拿大」，並謂「蘇聯旣不訐吾人入其國境，考察並報吿該國情形，更不許其國人知悉此間所發生之實情，其原因乃在該國情形不堪與吾國情形相提並論也」云。</p>
<h3>反美活動調查委會將調查好萊塢</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕衆議院反美活動調查委員會主席湯麥斯今日宣稱：該會將從事「調查好萊塢」。但委員尼克森則稱，須待立即調查之重要塲所尙多。第一爲政府職員名册，第一一爲各工會。就美國國防而論，此二處極端重要。又電影協會主席瓊斯登昨日向該會陳述，謂好萊塢雖有共產黨員，但「若彼等發動圖佔影城，必致一敗塗地」。電影業正設法整頓內部，但若男女演員僅因係共產黨員之故，即遭斥革，此種主張，渠甚反對。「彼等固然串演陰謀劇本，但在美國，只可檢舉，不能迫害」云。</p>
<h3>最後消息</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科廿九日廣播：英蘇雙方今在莫斯科開始談判英蘇協定，預定在外長會議終了前，予以完成。</p>
<p>〔本教訊〕莫斯科廿九日廣播：外長會議討論對德問題凡一小時，未有結果，改星期一再行討論。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲黃花崗七十二烈士殉難紀念日曁第四屆靑年節，本市各界除縣旗紀念外，各機關學校並休假一天。並於上午十時假座市體育館舉行盛大紀念儀式。到各界代表二千餘人。由吳市長，潘議長，靑年團吳幹事長，市商會徐寄廎，市黨部王先靑，謝大荒，財政局胡文元，衛生局張維，總工會水祥雲，婦女會錢劍秋，敎育會周斐成等任大會主席團。行禮如儀向革命先烈曁杭戰死難軍民靜默三分鐘，即由主席吳市長致詞稱：近年來中國之歷史可分三階段，初爲革命階段，在國父領導下，推翻滿淸，建立民國，並打倒軍閥。繼爲抗戰階段，在蔣主席領導下，抵抗侵略，打倒日本帝國主義，獲得最後勝利。現在則爲建國階段，望全國靑年從專學術研究以完成此建國任務。革命時需要大勇，抗戰期間着重殺身成仁，建國階段則賴智力，使科學與工業發達，文化敎育普及，迎頭趕上，以恢復中國五千年來之光榮歷史，重負起領導世界文化，向前邁進。紀念大會中吳市長致詞</p>
<p>（本報攝）</p>
<p>繼由潘議長演講云：中國靑年，過去已擔負革命，北伐與抗戰三次使命，犧牲奮鬥，終達成功。至於今日，中國靑年之責任更爲重大，因不但要建國，尙需維護世界和平。吾人張眼看世界每一角落是否有養成不和平之因素存在？建國後中國是否會成爲不能和平之火藥庫！要做到使中國不成爲火藥庫，靑年需盡衙大責任。第二次世界大戰係在巴爾幹爆發，其原因爲該地有弱點可被他人侵略之處，實際中國之「九一八」事件，已爲潛因，「七七」蘆溝橋事件，亦爲近因。爲避免第三次世界大戰爆發，至少欲使中國不再有一弱點可被人侵略。靑年人應特別重視自己責任，應求高深學問。三中全會宣言曾有指示，今日靑年節蔣主席之吿全國靑年書中，亦稱要建設國家先要求高深學問，指示靑年如何維護世界和平，尙希全國靑年共同努力云。</p>
<p>吳紹澍致詞稱：今日中國之靑年，除祈求和平及提高文化體格之水準外，還望民主政治眞正實施，求學與生活皆能獲得安定。市黨部代表謝大荒稱：歷史係由一代一代靑年熱血所寫成，自黃花崗始，經辛亥革命，五四，五卅以至八年抗戰，前仆後繼，經無數犧牲，方獲得光榮勝利。歷史一頁一頁演進，靑年所負之時代任務亦各個不同。今日中國之需要不是破壞，而是要統一，要安定。故望靑年發揮力量，以使社會安定，使國家統一。演講完畢後，由吳市長主特發給靑年越野賽跑優勝者獎品，繼全體呼口號，奏樂禮成，散會後並有汽車化裝遊行。</p>

<h3>新任江蘇監察使　嚴莊後日接事　接見記者發表談記　希望能淸靜無事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新任江蘇監察使嚴莊，定四月一日接事。昨接見記者稱：江蘇畿輔之區，爲我國之政治經濟文化中心，地位至爲重要。希望將來監察使署能如老式衙門之淸靜無事，蓋如此適足以表示政治已走上軌道也。本人早年於上海求學，對於本市之情形相當熟悉，上海情形甚爲複雜，其對於國家之重要性，非任何城市所能比擬。上海之一舉一動，領導全國，並影饗全國。中國欲上軌道，必須上海先上軌道。好的方面如此，壞的方面亦然。例如上海如有投機在熱，其他各地亦起而傚允。又本市學校林立，學生之數甲於全國，如社會現狀過於不如人意，則靑年學子將因對現實不滿，而流於偏激，誠爲國家之損失。由此而言，居於上海之各階層人士，對於國家所負之責任特重。本市自吳市長以下各負責人員，才具均屬一時之選，故能政績斐然，中外推頌，本人接事後，接觸之機會當多。</p>
<p>詢以監察使經費困難事，嚴氏答稱：以經常費而論，月僅一百七十萬元，辦事自感困難。惟悉監察院現已請准近二億元之調查費，一俟撥付，本署可望分得一部份，屆時一切視察調查工作，均得積極開展。以蘇省而言，蘇北光復之後，秩序未全恢復，一切問題尙多，故有首先視察蘇北各縣之需要。</p>

<h3>我最大軍艦　峨嵋號招待參觀　配備有雷達等最新儀器　醫院工塲廚房設備精緻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我現有最大軍艦，載重一萬五千噸之峨嵋號，於月前由香港來滬，泊高昌廟海軍江南造船所，整修機件及洗刷艦身，昨日下午一時邀本市新聞界前往參觀，艦長梁序昭上校等熱忱招待參觀畢，於五時許派登陸艇送各報記者歸來。</p>
<p>峨嵋軍艦原爲美國海軍運油艦瑪密號，美海軍上將尼米資曾任該艦首任輪機長，在其任職期內，曾被船機軋傷一指，至今猶傳爲美談。該艦於一九一六年十月編隊服役，參加第一次世界大戰，爲美海軍運輸艦配用柴油之第一艘。一九四二年第二次大戰爆發，該艦重新裝備，故艦上一切配備如主機，各項作戰儀器，雷達，測深儀，遠洋求向儀等，俱爲最新現代化設備</p>
<p>去夏美國贈艦太康號等八艘，橫渡太平洋返國途中，美國特派此艦隨行護送，担任補給，修理等工作。抵達我國後，美政府即令移交我方。我海軍常局於去年十一月選派優秀官兵在靑島接收，命名爲峨嵋軍艦。</p>
<p>峨嵋號爲一混合性之供應艦，總排水量一萬四千七百五十噸，艦長四七五呎，寬十六呎半，最高速率十三哩，備有三吋口徑砲五門，四十半厘機關砲二門，二十米厘機關砲八挺。艦上附設有小型醫院，內有手術室，藥房，病房等醫藥設備，現有醫務官二名主持。此外又有修械工塲，設有一九四二年式車床，鐵床，鋸木機，鐺床等十餘座。更有精緻小廚房。擅製中西點心。艦上且有洗衣機，燙衣機，皆爲岸上所不易見到者。</p>
<p>艦上有官佐士兵及海軍學校派艦實習學生等共三百六十三人。組織方面正副艦長下，分設艦務，通訊，槍砲，軍需，輪機，醫務，修械等七組，分担全艦事務。艦上官兵一律五時半起身，早操，淸潔，至六時三刻進早餐，然後各就本位勤務。十一時三刻進中飯，飯後休息，午睡或入圖書館閱讀書報雜誌。五時三刻晚餐，九時半就寢。艦上有放映設備，惜影片難於租到，雖有幾部電彩，但已爲全艦官兵看厭，故艦長希望中央製片廠能借予新片，藉調濟艦上之枯燥生活。談到待遇，艦上官佐兵士莫不搖頭苦笑。練兵每月僅二萬元，航海士兵每月八萬元，官佐亦不過十六萬元，與在美受訓時（全艦官兵皆曾在美受訓）官佐可月得三四百美金，不勝今昔之感。（下圖爲峨嵋號雄姿本報攝）</p>

<h3>孩子的命運掌握在你手裡</h3>
<p>— 陳鶴琴</p>
<p>紀念三十六年師範教育運動週</p>
<p>敬愛的敎師：</p>
<p>孩子的命運掌握在你手裏，你有沒有想到？</p>
<p>這就是說你是很能支配着孩子們底一切的。</p>
<p>我們姑且先從孩子們在學校裏的情形說起。</p>
<p>學校是孩子們的小天地，孩子們應該是挺高興的，在那裏他們學習各門功課，從各方面獲取知識的泉源，準備獻身未來的大世界，但是，無可諱言的，我們常常可以看到或者聽到某些孩子對學校裏的功課不大感到興趣，有的孩子痛恨算學，有些却不喜歡社會，討厭音樂及其他學科的孩子亦未嘗不是沒有，這些問題歸根結蒂一句話：「敎師害了他！」</p>
<p>問一問你自己或者人家的孩子：「爲甚麼不高興學算學？」他一定回答你一老師敎不好！」再問別一個，他瞇了瞇眼同樣的向你叨嘮着：「我不是不喜歡社會，是老師沒有敎得好，我不懂，所以我不高興去學了！」</p>
<p>這是「問題」，你可曾爲你自己的或者人家的孩子打算過？孩子要接受大自然大社會的知識，是天賦的權利，我們應該帮助他，切草讓他自然而然的放棄了。</p>
<p>敎師好，孩子也好，敎師敎得好，孩子自然亦學得好，一個敎法得當的老師一定可以避免增加孩子的困難，同樣的，一個各科都好的孩子一定因爲是得到優良敎師的合理指導。這一切是決定了孩子的一切，所以我要說孩子在學習上的成功，或者失敗，完全放在做敎師或者做父母；你的身上了。</p>
<p>孩子的命運掌握在你手裘，此其一。</p>
<p>再說怎樣敎孩子做人吧，</p>
<p>要孩子怎樣做，你自己先要怎樣做，孩子生來是無知無識的，不知什麼是好什麼是壞，他一舉一動可以說一方面受遺傳的影響，一方面受環境的的束，受敎育的支配，在他整個受敎育的階段來說，最重要的當然是在於敎師了。你要孩子有禮貌，首先要看你自己的禮貌，你要孩子怎樣待人接物，你先得自己怎樣待人接物。孩子是你的鏡子，你的一舉一動都在孩子的鏡子裏可以反映出來的。比方講你是一個悲觀的人，看事物都由悲觀的眼睛去看，那你所敎的孩子亦一定很多是悲觀的。如果你的態度是樂觀，那你所教的孩子亦是樂觀的。</p>
<p>千萬別輕視這些地方吧！即使很小很小的地方，我們當敎師或者做父母的處處都要以身作則，做個榜樣給孩子們看，對人待人，不僅言語行動，就連你的思想情緒都要以身作則。</p>
<p>此其二，够了，我們可以數到很多很多，留給你自己去思索體味。</p>
<p>要你自己的或者人家的孩子做良好的公民或者是個有害於社會的，全由你自己決定。請記取我那句話：</p>
<p>「孩子的命運掌握在你手裹！」</p>

<h3>美金債券擔保可靠　募銷辦法合商就緒　由部委託中央銀行推銷决不攤派</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部公債司司長陳炳章，日前自京來滬後，即與中央銀行總裁張嘉璈，洽談要公。陳氏昨日接見本報記者，對政府此次發行美金庫劵公債事，發表談話，渠稱：此次奉命來滬，與中央銀行張總裁洽商美金庫劵公債募銷辦法，及其基金監理委員會之組織，曾於廿九日上午與張總裁會談兩小時，大致就緒。定今日（卅日）回京呈報兪部長核定　與張總裁討論對象，包括。（一）庫劵公債募銷收款發票規則。（二）基金監理委員會組織規程。（三）各地募銷委員會組織規則，及其他有關事項。擬於核定後，趕於四月一日以前公布。關於基金監理委員會，力求加强組織，俾可鞏固債信，維護持票人之權益。至於基金監委人選，除條例上規定，由各機關社團推舉代表若干人以外，將由財部另行聘請其會之他機關社團之負責人參加，共同負實。</p>
<p>至於庫券公債之募銷事宜，擬由部委託中央銀行辦理。中央銀行得於各地設立募銷委員會，以資推動。收款方面，除各地中央銀行外，並可指定其他行莊，代收債款。推銷力求普遍，使各地各界，均有購買之便利。該項庫券公債，均係自由認購，決不攤派。因此次政府發行庫券公債，係以經濟方式，以解決經濟問題，即儘量改善發行之經濟條件。例如：（一）以保本辦法，使購債人可保持其投資公債之實値。（二）利息優厚，爲空前所未有。（三）一切募銷及基金監理，採取公開辦法，以昭大信。（四）庫券公債收入之用途，均用於生產建設。（五）確定基金庫券公債，均有可靠之担保品。例如庫券有國營生產事業，及接收之敵偽產業爲担保。公債則有中央銀行外匯基金爲担保，均極可靠。（六）設立基金委員會，負責辦理基金監理事項，俾得鞏固債券，維護購債人之權益。</p>
<p>總之，此次政府發行庫券公債，旨在吸收人民在國內國外之游資，以减少發行，穩定金融，充實外匯基金，調劑對外貿易。如能推銷順利，對於國家目前之財政經濟困難，必大有裨益。此項措施，有利於國，有利於民，相信各界一定能踴躍認購。一切發行之條例，均能表示政府已儘最大之努力。陳氏最後於握別記者時，復鄭重談稱：此次立法院會議，討論美金庫券公債條例時，兪部長亦列席說明，並剴切吿各立法委員稱：渠願以財政部長之地位，祖保該項庫券公債之信用云。</p>
<h3>本市銀樓業昨開臨時談話會　定一日復業擬再度請願</h3>
<p>本市銀樓業自上月十七日經濟緊急揹施方案實施，暫吿停業後，轉瞬已逾一月。經兩度晋京請願，現財部已公布銀樓金飾兌售辦法。該業於昨日上午十時，在該業公會召開臨時談話會，由姚聯芳主持，參加大小同行代表十餘人。討論決定要案如下：（一）定於四月一日全市銀樓一律正式復業，（二）金飾收進價照中央銀行掛牌每兩四十八萬元，兌出價遵照吳市長核定利潤每兩九萬元，共爲五十七萬元。（三）工資價格暫定粗工每錢二千至三千元，細工另議。</p>
<p>準備請願</p>
<p>據該業公會負責人談稱，此决該業決定勉力先行復業，係爲維持員工生計，今後業務最大之困難，實以原金至感缺乏，尙望當局能酌予供給，否則同業所存金飾售出，勢必無法補進，業務殊難展開。現待復業後，準備繼續向中央請願。</p>
<p>代表離滬</p>
<p>此次銀樓業停業後，全國各省市縣地方同業代表，紛紛來滬聯絡，並曾集體晋京請願。茲以問題已吿一段落，京滬銀棋相繼復業，所有北平·天津·廣東·浙江·寗波·江蘇·等各地代表，連日正分別離滬。截至昨日止，僅有湖南代表甘逸亭，漢口代表鄒靜軒，預定下週啓程歸返。</p>

<p>本市棉業界人士談稱，我國各棉花市塲均有攙假作僞之惡習，國產棉花因作僞之結果，含水量有達百分之三十五，含雜量有達百分之二十，水雜之多，爲世界冠，因此纖維變質糜爛，運輸工力浪費，糾紛繁多，貿易道德破壞，貿易信譽低落，國家和廠商所受損失，實難以數字計算。作僞之根本原因，爲售出商販圖謀取不法之利益，治於取締作僞之方法，可分治標本二項，治標方面，應由政府恢復各地棉花檢騐機構，辦理取締攙假作僞工作。禁止水雄含量超過法定限量，同時查辦攙假作僞之商販，以打擊其謀取不法利益之企圖。治本方面，應設法增加生產，流通金融，組織產銷合作社，實行集中管理軋花打包，實行棉花分級和水雜含量公正檢騐云。</p>
<h3>挽救整個商業危機放寬信用放欵限制　市商會具呈立法院</h3>
<p>市商會頃以政府修訂銀行法中，對於信用放款限制綦嚴，昨特具呈立法院，請予將上項條例予以放寬，以恤商艱。茲探錄其原呈如次：「查民國二十年三月二十八日公佈而未施行之銀行法，其第三十四條對於信用放款限制甚嚴，當時商人已感窒碍良多。茲聞鈞院正在擬訂之銀行法草案，對於信用放款較之舊銀行法限制更嚴，如付實施，則商家之需用信用放款，其途徑幾瀕斷絕，關係實鉅。查工廠之生產貸款，有原料機器可以抵押，進出口之國際貿易可用押匯，在外埠辦貨或銷於外埠之商品，可用承兌匯票。惟居最大多數，在本地進貨在當地門售之商店，現貨現賣，旣不能將商品存倉作質，亦不能用押匯及承兌匯票辦法，故向金融機關通融資金，祗可以往來透支爲信用借款。又如典當業在本身收受押品之放款機關，但以物品零星，向金融業訂的往來，亦無從採用轉抵辦法。此外如旅館業，酒菜館業，娛樂業，均無原料或商品可以抵押借款，亦祗有憑信用貸借。舉此爲例，其餘尙多，如信用放款瀕於斷絕，則上述各項商業，祗能向私人貸款，以資週轉，誠恐目前高利貼票之風氣，永難改革，資金旣無集中之望，利息亦無抑平之機，此事關係金融業尙細，而關係凡百商業實鉅。本會旣略有所聞，爲挽救商業危機，解除商業疾苦起見，不敢不據實上聞，萬祈於所訂銀行法規中，稍寬信用放款之限制，俾商業得　週轉，實爲公便。」</p>
<h3>粉廠與四聯總處洽商收購新麥貸款　總額約須一千六百億元</h3>
<p>當局爲平抑麵粉價格，特於三月起規定本市限價適用於京滬沿綫，實施迄今，已屆一月。茲據第四區麵粉工業公會負責人稱：由於各地情况各別，現僅南京。無錫·上海·三地，由中信局實施統配，其他各埠，零售業以申請手續麻煩，遷延日期亦多。資金短缺，不敷周轉等原因，未至中信局申請。現該局旣未配出，當地價格乃由市塲供求支配，職是之故，本市四大麵粉廠向產地收購小麥，價裕方面未能全如理想。本年新麥登塲，最早的在六月中旬，爲期雖遠，但爲免蹈去歲新麥登塲時，各廠無資收購之覆轍起見，現已非正式與四聯總處洽商貸款。設以二百萬担產量，目前市價每祖八萬元計，總額即在一千六百億元，資金雖能以增加周轉决數而减輕負担，但民營廠商力有不逮，甚望政府予以協助。</p>

<h3>新潮澎湃古城怒吼　護權運動在成都</h3>
<p>— 三月二十一日航訊　本報駐蓉記者周學端</p>
<p>春光濃郁，錦江無波，平靜的成都社會，這幾天被泛濫全國的護權愛國熟潮，激起了近百萬市民熱烈的愛國情緒。護權的呼聲響遍每一個社會角落，尤其表現在敎育文化界，這種慷慨激昂的愛國高潮，是成都十餘年來空前偉大民意的發揚，五四民族精神的重演，這一次的護權表現，是一般人公認的新五四運動。</p>
<p>護權愛國情緒熱烈　兩川人民着了先鞭</p>
<p>成都人民愛國情緒與民族意識，歷史上常常表現着全國的先鞭，辛亥起義的開國運動，是成都保路風潮作先導。八年抗戰，成都人民含辛茹苦紓財效力以八年奮鬥，寫成勝利復興民族光榮歷史的一頁。莫斯科外長會議莫洛托夫倡議的千涉中國內政，這是對全中國民族的最大侮辱。中國是反侵略戰爭中，貢獻最多犧牲最大的勝利國絕對不能容許任何國家藉中國內亂爲借口，對中國內政橫加干預，這是全國人民的公意。成都人民是國民一份子，愛國不甘落於人後，國際干涉論傳到成都，激起了百萬人民的正義怒火。</p>
<p>護權運動全國首先爆發在成都，四川省參議會代表七千萬人民發出怒吼，電請蔣主席及國民政府要求堅持立塲，並向外長會議提出嚴重抗議。接着是成都四川，華四，齊魯，成華四大學，國立理學院及省立藝術，會計，體育三專科學校全體敎授，蕭公權王兆榮張凌高等一百八十七人聯名向莫斯科外長會議通電抗議。怒潮澎湃在全川，陸續通電晌應約有全川一四八縣市參議會，成都報業公會及記者公會，川康國大代表聯誼曾。四川行政研究會，政經學會，社會建設學會，大中學術研究社，道德促進學會。中美，中英，中韓，中法比瑞文化協進會等文化團體。及武德學社，在鄉軍人會，大中社，民本社，大同社等社會團體，與四川省市各農會，敎育會，工會，商會等人民團體，共五百二十餘團體共爲正義與國格而呼籲。這是普及兩川七千萬人民的民族呼聲與愛國熱潮表現，正吿野心家與造亂者，中國人民是不可侮的。</p>
<p>八萬學生遊行行列寫成靑年運動壯史</p>
<p>作爲愛國前驅的成都靑年學生，這一次護權的激昂情緖，是十餘年來成都學生界的空前偉大表現。干涉中國論傳到成都，激起學生的愛國怒火，立即迅速組織了「成都市各級學校護權運動聯合大會」。十八日起全市學校罷課三日，並於十八日舉行維護國權大會，參加的包括四川，華四，齊魯，成華等全市大中小學學生八萬餘人，共計五十餘單位學校，這是成都學生界的空前盛會。</p>
<p>會塲在成都文化區的華西壩，臨時推華大李小姐主席，她激勗地申述學生對外長會議無理討論中國內政問題的憤慨情緖。接着是川大華大訓導長勉學生從實騐室研究國防科學來充實愛國遝動，名敎授劉世傳就國際法觀點，指出國際干涉是非法的侵權行爲。最後在堂聲雷動中通過大會宣言及致外長會議呈國民政府蔣主席兩電，高呼：「中國內政問題，自有政府合法處理，我們要用行動來保障國家主權的獨立與自由，我們堅決反對存心出賣祖國的陰謀集團，因此我們怒吼出維護國家主權，反對國際干涉，集中靑年力量，搽除統一障礙」</p>
<p>大會在會後舉行遊行，八萬人的偉大行列搆成民族新的長城，八萬人的愛國呼聲嚮澈雲霄，路綫沿全市繁榮區域，兩傍沿途的數十萬觀衆氣憤塡膺，隨聲倡和，高呼：「全國靑年團結起來」，「反對勾結外寇危害國家的黨派」……等口號。激昂慷慨的情緒，有使觀衆淚下者，這種靑年精神的最高表現，是中華民族精魂之所寄，也是中華民族創迭數千年光榮歷史的表徵。十八日以後各大中學及各界人民自動遊行的連續三日，這吿訴了世界，中華民族永遠是不可屈服的。</p>
<p>靑年是國家的中堅，民族的骨幹，時代靑年精神的張弛代表國家民族的興衰存亡。看歷史。有北宋的太學生運動，然後有宋朝南渡的復興，民初的五四運動，啓發了革命北伐的民族革命情緒。這一次成都敎育界及靑年學生護權運動，是五四精神的再生，也是一决新五四運動，這在將來中國建國復興史上，一定寫上選一篇燦爛光輝的靑年運動史篇。</p>

<h3>瀰格朗琪羅的早期生涯</h3>
<p>— 徐帆</p>
<p>你看到一個大理石的彫刻時，你決不再會想到它是一塊無生命的大理石，那是一種多麼驚奇的技術啊—有這種技術的人，稱做彫刻家。瀰格朗琪羅（Micheal　Angelo），是一個永垂不朽的彫刻家。</p>
<p>他生在四百年前的意大利，他有不少的兄弟姊妹，都被呌去經營質賣，只有他被送到學校，裏他的父親希望他能成爲一個學者。</p>
<p>但這孩子却不喜歡他的功課，他丟開了他的書本，去到美術工作室裏度他的時間。在家時他總是畫圖，他把許多小紙塊的速寫保藏起來，就是用木炭畫在牆上的速寫也設法給它保留下來。</p>
<p>他的父新不喜歡這些，他不希望他的孩子成爲一個藝術家，因爲那時藝術家常常是窮困不堪，他懲罰他的孩子去畫圖。但這些奄無用處；除了繪晝以外再沒有什麼能使瀰格朗琪羅感到興趣。</p>
<p>瀰格朗琪羅住在佛羅稜斯的一個學校內，他的雙親住在這個城市裏，校內有一個孩子與瀰格朗琪羅同樣地喜愛繪圖，他們做了很好的朋友，他倆在佛羅稜斯跑來跑去，他們喜歡看藝術家們工作。</p>
<p>這孩子的朋友在佛羅稜斯知道有一個很有名望的藝術家，瀰格朗琪羅和他的朋友去藝術家的工作室去拜訪，瀰格朗琪羅想能長久的去學畫，但他害怕他的父親不應許。</p>
<p>最後漲格朗琪羅的父親同意了。一天，他向這藝術家商量，他把他孩子的速寫給這藝術家看，這藝術家驚喜地說：「我願意收他，讓你的孩子到我這里來學畫！」於是，商量算是成功了。</p>
<p>現在，佛羅稜斯有一個快樂的孩子，瀰格朗琪羅的思想沉醉在學畫的興奮中，他把整個的時間全放在這開始的工作裏，他這樣地和着一些同時學習的學生工作了三年。</p>
<p>有一天，瀰格朗琪羅看着一個學生在畫，那是在臨摹一張先生的圖，他感到先生的圖作得不好，就很快的給它勾出一個改正的輪廓，這少年臨摹後，把它還給先生，先生看到畫幅上加了些新的錢條便問「誰改了這張圖？」這孩子回答：「瀰格朗琪羅」。「是的」，先生喊出來了，「我知道再沒有別人能這樣修改的！」</p>
<p>那些時候，公共塲所的牆壁上常常畫有圖，瀰格朗琪羅的先生正晝着一個敎堂牆壁的裝飾，一些好的學生都爬到梯子上，幫着做這工作。有一天先生不在，學生們又去工作；瀰格朗琪羅作了一張圖，是描繪敎堂內部，那些少年與工作者，先生回來看到這圖，那緊凑的晝面使他驚訝，他不覺喊着「這孩子已經知道的比我做的更多了！」</p>
<p>同時間，佛羅稜斯住着一個高貴的王子，他的家是一座宮庭，四周圍着花園，這宮庭與公園呌做聖的翰·瑪克斯（S，t．　Mark＇s），這王子很喜歡美好的彫塑，他曾到世界各地去收集，許多放置在聖的翰。瑪克斯的花園。裏</p>
<p>這王子的胸襟寬擴，他願意讓別人也能領償到這彫塑，他寫信給所有佛羅稜斯的畫家說：「選二個你最好的學生，帶他們到聖的翰花園來，他們能够在這裏學習到彫塑，有一個好的先生在這裏候着他們！」</p>
<p>當瀰格朗琪羅的先生接到後，把信讀給學生們聽，在室內的學生沒有一個不願去的，但他們只能去二個。他們都想着瀰格朗琪羅將被選，他們都淸楚他是一個最好的學生，是的，瀰格朗琪羅和他的朋友被帶到官庭那兒去學習了。</p>
<p>在聖的翰。瑪克斯花園中，瀰格朗琪羅初次把整個時間放在繪畫中，那時，他看到有一個靑年在用黏土砌塑，他想與他同樣地去做，因此，瀰格朗琪羅嘗試了黏土的塑造工作。</p>
<p>他常常去看石匠們打刻石塊和大理石，他們正在建造一座大的圖書館。這位靑年的藝術家與這些石工匠做了熟悉的朋友，他把他們的一些沒有用了的大理石塊討來，從那些少數的石塊中，他嘗試一些人物的彫刻，開始了他偉大彫刻的生涯。</p>

<h3>美術節聊展巡禮</h3>
<p>— 朱璧</p>
<p>近來由於工商業不景氣，交通困難，上海的美術展覽會似乎沒有從前的昌盛了。尤其是聯展更不易見到。看報上登着慶祝美術節聯展的消息，有兩個會塲的大規模的展覽，同時不賣門票，足見提倡者提倡藝術的熱忱，也提起了我參觀的興趣。</p>
<p>在美術節的平上，我踏上了國貨公司二樓。一統連接着十餘間之多的大會塲，佈置得整齊妥貼，井井有序，首先予我以崇敬之感。一進門就有葉譽虎，張繼，馬公愚諸家的書法，吳湖帆的山水精品「高空奇峯」。張大千敦煌石室臨本，高達丈許之巨幅佛像，用粉色畫在布上，輝煌生動，不啻給吾人親見了壁畫原作。魚國稱雄的汪亞　此次出品，睛出平常，可見一個認識自然的作家其表現之美是不僅於筆墨之間的。與劉獅諸人盡魚，均爲師法造化之作。王進珊的人物「揮扇老人」極有素描修養。國畫中有以熊貓爲題者，作者不願受古人題材的限制；完全以自我現時直覺爲創造起點，亦自可取。</p>
<p>西畫部份：劉海粟的風景，花卉均以獷野筆觸，迅速完成，魄力雄渾。顏文樑的風景，以極精細一筆不茍的手法，給人們以規矩秩序之可貴。油畫中間最大的畫幅「滿目瘡痍」爲張充仁的最近創作。他描寫工業毀於戰爭，我們要提起建設的精神。張氏在畫面上所表現的色彩的熱烈，筆觸的雄奇，構圖的含蓄，處處透露出內在的力量。女作家周如瑛的靜物，紅色的大理花隨隨便便的散在白桌面上，背後隱的着瓷甕，對於物體性質的表現，色彩的對襯，都能恰到好處。哈定的永彩是用盡水彩上乾濕虛實的韻味，他的「歲之始也」和王琿的「一年之計」都充分的發揮出創造的精神，在患難的時局環境中，可以見到我們靑年晝家之努力者；實有其人。劉旭滄的「花」和「夏」色彩用筆細膩而又放浪，冉熙的水彩全用濕潤，李詠森的水彩都用乾皺，皆風趣橫生。顧廷康長精密，沈印英講解脫，自各顯其長。其他女作家方君璧，沉雁均出精品。總之，此次西畫作品較去年勝利展出品爲多，永準亦高。</p>
<p>雕刻部份以張充仁氏的「吳湖帆造像」神態生動最受人注意，周如瑛的「民以食爲天」題材新頴，手法順熟。許士騏「人像」，精緻可愛。劉開渠，戈永良亦均有傑作陳列。</p>
<p>八仙橋靑年會雪賡堂第二會塲，專展攝影。想以地位小的緣故，張數並不多，然均屬名作；有已見世界攝影年刋之發表者如劉旭滄，朗靜山得意諸作是。其他名家林漢侖，盧施福，莊學本均有傑作陳列，爲研究攝影藝術者不可錯過之好機會。</p>
<p>藝術是人類智慧的結晶，文化的表現，一個民族的興衰，進化的程度，全以藝術爲證。然從事藝術工作者，每爲物質社會所疏忽，故恒多淸苦。當此生活維艱之現代，能有如許多而美之精品予吾人以觀賞，實覺可敬。但我雖然看了這次展覽會胸襟爲之一快，而想到藝人淸高生活不禁起無限同情。</p>
<h3>綜合藝術</h3>
<p>— 兪劍華</p>
<p>都君冰如本治應用藝術，允擅長圖案·裝飾·及廣吿等畫，一日千里，已臻爐火純靑之候；而且驚其思想之超妙，直有匪伊所思之慼。</p>
<p>所謂綜合藝術者，大體以詩歌爲主幹，將詩歌之情節分爲若干段，每段畫一圖，圖之手法或中或西，或古或今，每幅不同，各有逸趣，每幅並將所書詩歌之一段，用各種字體畫於其上，或如圖景，或如鐘鼎，或如碑帖，而尤以作爨寳子體者爲多，而且精冶金石書晝詩文於一爐，開古今中外藝術之新徑，名曰綜合藝術不虛也。</p>
<p>其最堪玩味之作，爲長恨歌詩畫三十八幅，鑪香鐸韻圖十幅，刺虎歌九幅，木蘭從軍十六幅，回文詩八幅，紅豆詞七幅，月圓花好四幅，正氣歌一巨幅，可作詩文讀，可作碑帖讀，可作國畫讀，可作西畫讀，可作圖案讀，海上畫家如林，向無此作，眞所謂匠心獨運，生面別開者矣。今都君將其傑作數十點，公展於寗波同鄕會盡廳，欲識綜合藝術之面目，以廣眼界者，不可不先睹爲快也。書法係屬藝術，須有愛好藝術之天賦與夫不計歲月之功夫，寢饋於斯，方可自尅苦之鍛鍊中得其造詣。</p>
<h3>陸士雄之書法</h3>
<p>— 之志</p>
<p>書法係屬藝術，須有愛好藝術之天賦與夫不計歲月之功夫，寢饋於斯，方可自尅苦之鍛鍊中得其造詣。</p>
<p>友人陸士雄君，世居江蘇金山，其先人於該地開設書肆，因一得自幼即日坐書城，並以天性愛一好藝術，閒常博覽各家碑帖，恒一對客陳毫，代人書寫對聯，而陸君以此作練字機會亦特多矣。</p>
<p>今之靑年，對於中西文學，恒多偏廢，長於此者即短於彼，伊因家學淵源，出身敎會大學，故於中英文均能兼長並勝。又因服務於保險事業較久，爰曾編著保險學之書籍刊物甚夥，前中央研究院院長蔡元培曁中國銀行總經理宋漢章諸氏，對陸君著述，均致美評。</p>
<p>陸君秉性沉默，寡於言笑，有爲有斷，膽大而心細，誠懇而負責，吳佩孚上將曾親筆書贈「山石不流動天日自高明」，以喻其品性與書法，可謂洽合身份。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血208</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>話剛說畢，一撒手，一顆樟腦丸大的東西，篤的一聲響，打在車裏那個靑年男子胸前，順着衣服，滾了下去。車中男女，吃了一驚，向車外瞧時，只見那個襤褸少年，已經退到幾碼之外，仍舊露着滿口的雪白牙齒，笑着，行了一個舉手禮，轉身走了。，</p>
<p>「這是什麼玩藝？」女約有此驚　。</p>
<p>「大槪沒有惡意吧。」男的似乎很冷靜。等那勤務放好旅行箱，忙着上車發動了引擎，車已行動，那靑年男子，才把那顆東西拈了起來；原來是一個小紙球。把紙球舒展開來，只見上面寫着很剛勁的四個中國字，附着一個號碼：</p>
<p>「華懋飯店……0915。」</p>
<p>「是支那特務嗎？」女的悄聲間着。</p>
<p>「也許。」男的似乎來不及地抽着烟捲。</p>
<p>「你倦了嗎？」</p>
<p>「爲什麼不倦？……打從昨晚十點五十分起，三小時時汽車，接着四小時多飛行，機器一直響着不停，又是一小時的油艇，吵得沒法闔眼。」、</p>
<p>「我想還是我們女子的耐力經久些，不是嗎？」女的說着，把男的手上那張紙，取了過去，瞧了又瞧；又迎着車窗的光綫，把那字條照了又照，好像要把字條約秘密研究出來似的。</p>
<p>二十分鐘後，他們已經安頓在萬歲館裏面了。</p>
<p>「節目怎麼呢，大哥？」</p>
<p>「你的節目可沒有對我發表過哩……至於我個人的節目；第一，洗浴，第二，早餐，第三，睡。」</p>
<h3>失業人請願動武</h3>
<p>— 玄石</p>
<p>失業是件苦事，當此物價高漲下失業，允是是一件苦事。受了失業的折磨已久，心境必然惡劣，因而與人接觸，祗要稍有爭執，就會伸出拳頭來打架。倘然這些爭執觸動了心境的話，更是一觸即發，自己的理智也就無法遏制了。</p>
<p>日前某業失業工人二百餘，赴該業公會請願，不知爲了什麽，雙方談至中途，忽然言語發生衝突，失業工人一時氣憤，竟然動起武來。按情理說，同屬一個行業，而且同屬一個身份，有人失業，應當融融洽洽，共謀救助之道，殊不知此時雖屬同行，却橫着有業與無業的鴻溝，使他們隔膜起來。那有業的礙於事實，未必能多所帮助，那無業的却覺得對方缺乏同情，眼看自己挨餓，心中未免不快。由此不快，祇要一言不合，就會衝突起來。局外人看了覺得他們火氣大，其實却由於心境過於惡劣，旣有了導火綫，自然立刻爆發。</p>
<p>再說那些有業的，多數人的心境何嘗好了。吃不飽，餓不煞，整日夜也懷着一肚子的怨氣。祗要有機會，他們也會大吵大鬧一下，以洩心頭之恨。前些時有人報吿，說上海有百萬以上失業的人，在饑餓綫上掙扎圖存，其實有業的人，何嘗不也在掙扎。我們在近百年來，就老是在窮困之中掙扎着，不過近年來在長期戰爭之後，生活愈見困苦，因而掙扎的情形也愈見悽慘罷了。越是悽慘，心頭之火也越是旺盛。</p>
<p>常常聽道學先生說「人心大變了！」其實人心何嘗變，祗是多了一團火。這團火曾經用在抗戰，使我們堅特到底，戰勝了强暴。現在我們應該怎樣使用這團火呢？善用之能放出萬丈光芒，不善用之便永遠是一團怨火。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>靑年節的話</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>有人說中國靑年是幸運的，因爲他有機會看到這個絢爛的時代；但同時又有人說，我們何不幸而做中國靑年，歷經憂患，飽嘗艱苦。這種樂觀和悲觀的看法，都不見得是中國靑年的禍福：面臨着偉大的時代而未滲入自己一滴血汗的，他只是一個舞臺前的觀衆，人生的過客；吃了苦，受了難，如果是爲担負這時代的慘痛的，他應該毫無怨允，欣然自樂！</p>
<p>靑年的熟血，必須通入時代的脈膊。我們無所謂幸與不幸，應該只有快樂與更大的快樂。</p>
<p>人生不能說絕無苦悶，靑年的苦悶自然更多：經濟上的，政治上的，愛情和家庭間的…但苦悶不是生理，而是病理。懂得如此，他應該自己療治同時也該療治他的同病者。不要自己先喪失了生的意志，苦悶只是蛻變的一個過程，新生的快樂是可期的。</p>
<p>苦悶是一切建設的象徵：藝術如此，人生如此。</p>
<p>前一輩人吿訴我們：「你們是靑年，應該這樣那樣」：他們把自己是看作死靈了！但我們絕不該再照樣的吿誡下一輩：「我們就要老了，一切的希望都在你們身上」：把自己和現實遊離開來，逃避責任，希望他人，這種靑年是最沒有出息的。</p>
<p>靑年和非靑年，不是時間可以劃分的，却在於心力的健全與否。</p>
<p>「三二九」定爲「靑年節」，意在呌人緬懷先烈而振奮黃花碧血的精神，前一代靑年爲挽救祖國而流血，這一代靑年則爲建設祖國而流汗，血汗交黏成一片，我們才能完成巍峨的建築。</p>
<p>靑年人不要對仇恨飲泣或報復，也不要因仇恨而至褊激，違反了本性與志願。寬容，悲壯，純直，堅毅，這是中國靑年所必俱的氣質。（寫於三十六年靑年節前二天）</p>
<h3>點絳脣</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>洋口紅</p>
<p>像愛神弓，口紅巧染多嬌媚！拜洋心理：「外國脣膏美」！</p>
<p>驚走私多，國貨無生意；櫻桃嘴，抹工人淚，把廠家吞閉！</p>
<p>註：嘴脣化妝有呌「愛神弓式」，見本報前幾月紐約化妝專家談話。其實即我們所稱的「菱角式」。</p>
<h3>僧尼同居</h3>
<p>— 陸沉</p>
<p>杭市僧尼公然同居，浙主席沈鴻烈對此敗風壞俗，引吭「心理建設，」擬予「嚴加整飭」。其實我以爲「大可不必」，蓋和尙，男人也，尼姑，女子也，「陰陽調和，本屬美事」，欲加改良風俗之點，全國之中，一省之內，其須要一心理建設」者多多，「僧」「尼」而「公然同居」，說穿了「不過小事」而已。</p>
<p>周佛海竟免死，此可以想見國家愛才之至意。「據我所知，」過去中央本對其不薄，然終不能令其「與孔宋財位相埓」，遂使「幡然從汪」，蓋周佛海所欲者，堪與孔宋財位相埓」也·「從汪」後，「財位」達於「頂點」，今以待死之身而竟得免，陳褚有知，相形「遜色」·上海話曰：「迭格是周佛海格苗頭」也，誰云不然。</p>
<h3>記楊十驤</h3>
<p>— 愛菊</p>
<p>直隸總督，爲各省督撫領袖，故粵匪平後，曾文正，李文忠，皆以爵相坐鎮。甲午後爲王文韶，最昏憤者，爲庚子時代之裕驗，仁和入樞廷榮祿繼之，裕又繼榮之後，迎合慈禧，崇拜義和團，其誤國殃民，即在滿人中，亦下下等也。而漢人中之直督，自命表表者，有二人焉：其一爲楊士釀，蓮府乃名父之子，以詞林起家，改官直隸道員，庚子時，亦在天津圍城中小有建樹，洋兵入天津時，且負重傷焉。以視今之遠避後方，而開口抗戰，閉口抗戰者，似尙勝一籌；議和時，曾參合肥相國幕，居然陳臬開藩，驟躋高位，乃兄楊大郞士爕（味莼）爲工部郞中，味蒓蓮府二人與伯兄一爲壬午同年，一爲乙酉同年，故余知之甚稔；其政績姑置不論，其軼事大有可述者，生平以懼內著名，一聞河東獅子吼，即如方山子（即梳妝跪池之陳糙）之拄杖落地心茫然，性允篤嗜皮黃，除辦公外，行吟坐臥，所哼哼者。非反調，即慢板也，故臨終之日，一曲高歌，即撒手四云。某名士戲挽之云：「平生喜與絲肉習，到死不聞綺羅香」。蓋夫人奇妬，一生從無姬侍，故云爾。當時傳誦，以爲談資。</p>
<p>楊氏昆季本多才，蓮府爲楊四郎，除楊五郞杏城，與錢幹丞爲徐世昌之哼哈二將外，楊三郞士晨，亦壬辰進士，八郞芰靑，與余四次同試秋圍，以官卷故，且往往同號，其才華亦甚富瞻，惜未遇耳。</p>
<p>蓮府文筆極當行，詞章允名賣，八郞眷一曲中人，名素雲，乃兄爲集杜工部詩一聯贈之云：「深心託豪素，盪胸生層雲」。後又另眷一人，名紅玉，乃兄亦代製一聯云：「儘有春圍紅峽蝶，更無人識玉蟾蜍」。素雲紅玉，名皆極熟而俗，兩聯對仗旣工，詞藻亦麗，乃能以渾成大方出之，實是才人之筆，凡此皆八郞吿我者，故附記之。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「兩個極大的耳朶，大耳朵！」正在哭泣的榮兒，忽然用手背揩，爭眼淚，回頭來吿訴他們。他聽阿史在津津有味地描繪他的「兎子爸爸」，心裹就一高興，不覺暫時忘掉了眼前的一切。</p>
<p>「眞的！眞的！兩個大耳朶，又光又滑的大耳朵」！二十幾歲的阿史也還有些天眞未泯。「那一對眼睛也神氣得很，敎人看了就愛！……</p>
<p>他說得雖然上勁，可是他的主人聽明白旣不是金製的，也並不鑲嵌着什麼金鋼鑽，便不再感到興趣了。</p>
<p>「別多說了！小心那個箱子！」他像斥責似的截斷了阿史的話。</p>
<p>小沈却不肯錯過這機會。</p>
<p>「小弟弟，別心急，明兒我再給你去買一個」！他用人類所希有的柔和的聲音，向正在看着徐胖子發怔的榮兒說。</p>
<p>「買不到的！」榮兒撅着嘴回答。</p>
<p>外面又是一陣劇烈的爆炸聲，蘭緊握了兩手的冷汗。</p>
<p>「我給你去定做！」小沈一心想把這五歲的孩子逗得歡喜起來。「這裏定不到，上重慶去定，上昆明去定；中國定不到，上美國去定！」</p>
<p>他以爲這樣一定可以把這們孩子哄歡喜了。</p>
<p>「你又不曾看見過兎子爸爸，那裏知道它是怎麼個樣兒的！」却不道小榮偏說出了幾句比大人還兇的話來。</p>
<p>這可使小沈有一些窘了。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈！」沈胖子幸災樂禍地笑。始終强裝鎭定的蘭待了這麼久還不見　　和祝兆年的影子，神經已緊張到了麻木的程度，根本沒有聽見小沈和榮兒的回答，因此也毫無表示，使小沈眞覺　難以下塲。</p>
<p>又是炸彈聲和機關槍聲。</p>
<p>「今兒日本鬼子倒是存心來　　　，丟了這麼多的炸彈還不逃走」，　　　幾個躱警報的人這樣說，總算無　　替小沈解了圍。</p>
<p>「就爲我們的空軍都退往　州去了」，小沈也就立刻抓住這個機會，和他們　訕起來，暫時只得放棄再向　進攻。（二九）</p>

<h3>The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee is Established to Review Relevant Constitutional Laws and Regulations; Chairman Sends a Telegram Encouraging Assistance in National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The first standing committee meeting of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee was held at 3:00 PM on the 29th. 178 people attended. Chairman Sun Ke reported on the Legislative Yuan's review of various laws and regulations related to the implementation of constitutionalism, focusing on three points: (1) The government has decided to promulgate various laws and regulations on April 1st. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan must complete the legislative procedures within three months. Also, because this committee has not yet been established, various laws and regulations have not been submitted to this committee for study. (2) Regarding personnel matters, the original chairman of this committee was designated to be Chairman Chiang, but because Chairman Chiang was unable to handle both positions, he designated me to serve. The position of Secretary-General will be held by Hong Lanyou. (3) The Standing Committee was established today, and the Research Committee, Review Committee, and Publicity Committee will also be established today.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The first meeting of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee was held at 3:40 PM on the 29th in the conference room on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. Chairman Sun Ke delivered a speech, reporting on the establishment of various committees of the association, the process of preparation, and, in his capacity as President of the Legislative Yuan, reported on the Legislative Yuan's recent review of various laws and regulations related to the implementation of the constitution. Subsequently, four vice-chairmen, Zeng Qi, Xu Chuanlin, Mo Dehui, and Zhang Ji, delivered speeches separately. Following this, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou announced Chairman Chiang's telegram to the committee and reported on important documents of the committee. Immediately after, the draft of the committee's procedural rules was discussed. More than 20 committee members spoke. After discussion, the following was resolved: (1) The chairman will designate three people from each of the four committees to form a review committee to review the committee's procedural rules, and then submit it to the general meeting for discussion. The designated members are Zhang Yuanfa, Huang Boya, Xi Yuhua, He Yangling, Liu Tianchu, Zhang Zhongyou, Chen Yixiu, Su Xianyang, Xu Tianzong, Zhou Shusheng, Wang Landan, and Zheng Tianshi, totaling twelve committee members. Vice-Chairman Mo Dehui will be the convener. (2) The committee will write to the National Government requesting that relevant constitutional laws and regulations be submitted to the committee for review. (3) The session is tentatively scheduled for three days, with review meetings held every day at 9:00 AM and general meetings at 3:00 PM, adjourning at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association held its first meeting on the 29th. Chairman Chiang's telegram to the association reads as follows: "To the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, and members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee: Implementing constitutionalism and realizing democracy is the final goal to which the Founding Father devoted his entire life, and it is also the aspiration that the Chinese Kuomintang has pursued together with the people of the whole country for decades. Although there have been difficulties, the convening of the National Assembly has suffered setbacks, but those who have worked hard and strived to implement constitutionalism have persevered despite repeated setbacks. Finally, in November of the year following the victory of the War of Resistance, the National Assembly was convened and the Constitution was enacted. This is all thanks to the spirit of the Founding Father and the sacrifice of the blood of countless revolutionary and anti-Japanese martyrs. It is a matter of common gratification for the government and the people. However, the preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism is complex and time is short. The government urges all responsible departments to step up their efforts, and it relies on your committee to pool your wisdom and efforts to advance together in order to complete this great undertaking as scheduled. Recalling that in November of the 32nd year, when the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association was established, Zhongzheng once said: "We should not only pay attention to constitution-making, but also pay attention to constitutional implementation, so that after the constitution is promulgated, especially in the first decade or decade, it can be implemented effectively and smoothly, without obstacles or disputes." This kind of expectation is even more relevant today. Although a complete constitution has been made, how to ensure its effective, smooth, unobstructed, and dispute-free implementation in the future is the most important preparatory work at present, and it is also the most noble task of your committee. It is hoped that all members will remember the hardships of the Founding Father and the martyrs and the people of the whole country in building the country, the people's earnest expectations for constitutionalism, and the importance of their own tasks. Strive together and provide as much assistance as possible, so that the great cause of national reconstruction can be completed as scheduled. I am extremely hopeful. Now, as your committee is established and holds its first meeting, I express my sincere wishes. Please be aware. Chiang Kai-shek, Government Document of March 29th."</p>
<h3>The Central Government Commemorates Revolutionary Martyrs; Chairman Chiang Leads the Ceremony; A Memorial Service for Fallen Soldiers is Held Afterwards</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Today is the Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs. The Central Government held a memorial service at the National Government at 9:00 AM. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Committee Member Zou Lu delivered a speech, stating that we should commemorate the revolutionary martyrs and the soldiers and civilians who died in the War of Resistance, continue the unyielding revolutionary spirit, and complete the great cause of national reconstruction. After the memorial service, at 10:30 AM, a spring memorial ceremony for fallen soldiers was held at the Zhengqi Hall of the National Revolutionary Martyrs Shrine in Linggu Temple. The four golden characters "Loyalty," "Filial Piety," "Patriotism," and "Nationalism" were hung on the left and right sides of the hall.

<h3>Shao Lizi Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City News] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. According to reporters, this trip is purely to handle private affairs. He believes that the reorganization of the government can be realized in the shortest possible time. He is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight.</p>
<h3>The Authorities' Approach to Reorganizing the Government; Purely Based on Meritocracy; The Youth Party is Discussing and Drafting a List of Government Committee Members Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Diplomatic circles report: US Secretary of State Marshall is currently meeting in Moscow. There has been no recent urging of the National Government to reorganize. His statement when he left China was that he hoped that the National Government would accommodate various parties and non-partisan free individuals in addition to Kuomintang personnel, intending to allow leaders from all sectors of society who are inclined to freedom to join the government and cooperate with the Kuomintang to work together for the preparatory work of China's constitutionalism and to overcome this difficult period. This time, the authorities are reorganizing the government entirely voluntarily. The hope is to cooperate with the Kuomintang, so it will not be absolutely limited to parties, and will be purely based on meritocracy. This is the latest trend in the government reorganization issue.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The Youth Party's specific demands for participating in the government focus on personnel aspects. From the central government to the local governments, from government agencies to public opinion organs and educational and financial institutions, they hope to have some allocation. A certain central committee member of the Youth Party has called for a "thousand-person movement," meaning that the number of participants will reach as many as 1,000. The government side focuses on discussing the reorganization of the central political institutions first. Other matters cannot be discussed yet, so it is difficult for all parties to reach an agreement at this time.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Zeng Qi, Liu Siying, Liu Dongyan, Xie Chengping, Lin Li, and Zhang Bolun of the Youth Party took the night train to Shanghai on the 29th to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting of the Youth Party in Shanghai on the 30th to discuss issues related to participating in the reorganization of the government. The list may be decided after the meeting. Today, Zeng told reporters: The policy guidelines jointly discussed by all parties have been approved by the party's Central Committee and are awaiting timely announcement. As for the Youth Party's participation in the reorganization of the government, it is still hoped that the government can open up comprehensive local political power so that people from all parties can participate. Zeng also said: The announcement of the list of government reorganization members is expected to be realized in early April.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Our City News] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing last night and is expected to arrive this morning. Chen Qitian returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. The Central Standing Committee meeting of the party is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM today to discuss and draft a list of government committee members.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Xu Chuanlin, Yang Junming, and seven others from the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 29th. Xu and Yang then visited Hong Lanyou and attended the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association in the afternoon. In the evening, they visited Wu Tiecheng for a long talk. Yang Junming told reporters: The Central Standing Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party has already passed the policy guidelines, but these guidelines cannot be confused with the reorganization of the government. Therefore, it is solemnly stated that the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet discussed the nomination list and participation in the government, and it cannot be said that there is any decision. The words that have been spread outside are merely speculation.</p>
<p>[Our News] Secretary-General Lei Zhen told reporters yesterday that the main reason why the Democratic Socialist Party's list of government committee members has not been submitted is the consideration of candidates. He denied the rumors that the party demanded a thorough reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the opening of local political power. He also believes that the list may be submitted in the shortest possible time. Jiang Yuntian did not go to Beijing the night before. Yesterday, he visited Lei to discuss the matter and also said that the delay in submitting the list was entirely due to the candidate issue. Once the list is decided, he will go to Beijing with Lei.</p>
<h3>Central Youth Corps Secretary-General Chen Delivers a Broadcast Speech to the Nation's Youth</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Secretary-General Chen Cheng of the Central Youth Corps broadcast to the nation's youth from the Central Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 4th Youth Day (29th). The original speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"Today is our first Youth Day and Memorial Day for Revolutionary Martyrs since our victorious return to the capital. Recalling today thirty-six years ago, the martyrs of Huanghuagang, at the cost of shedding their blood, fought against the autocratic government of the Qing Dynasty. Although this battle was not successful, the revolutionary spirit of the martyrs, who did not care about success or failure, disregarded their own interests, and pressed forward courageously, has shaken the world and awakened the compatriots of the whole country. Therefore, the Battle of Huanghuagang was the starting point for the success of the revolution and the harbinger of the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty. Today, as we face this great memorial day, admiring the偉縝 of the martyrs of the past, we should encourage each other to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the martyrs and continue to work hard to complete the great cause of national reconstruction.</p>
<p>First of all, we should have a clear understanding of the current situation. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist Party has actively expanded its territory and carried out armed rebellion. The consistent policy of the central government has been to seek peaceful unification and active construction in order to relieve the suffering of the people. Therefore, the Political Consultative Conference and the Military Three-Person Group were established to engage in peace talks. However, the CCP used the cover of political consultation to expand its strength, attempting to seize power by force. Recently, not only did it refuse peace talks, but it also abandoned the constitution legally formulated by the National Assembly, refused to recognize the central government and all treaties it had signed with foreign countries, and even implemented total mobilization and launched a full-scale rebellion, such as the previous attack on Xuzhou, the threat to the capital, the invasion of Changchun, and the obstruction of the government's takeover of the Northeast, which are the more obvious examples. Under these circumstances, the central government's hope for a political solution has been shattered, and the government can no longer tolerate delays. Therefore, it cannot口　　　　　　the Chinese Communist Party is actually a violent and treasonous group, and can no longer be regarded as an ordinary and legal political party like those of other countries. Unless the CCP can repent, voluntarily stop the violent rebellion, and disarm, it must be thoroughly resolved. Only in this way can the obstacles to peace be removed and the mission of national reconstruction be completed. This is the first point that I hope the youth of the whole country will especially recognize clearly.</p>
<p>Secondly, with a clear understanding, we must further study whether the central government has confidence in suppressing the rebellion. This is easy to see by looking at the fact that the CCP is increasingly heading towards self-destruction. What the CCP is doing is not only an act that violates the interests of the country and the nation, but also a betrayal of the country and the nation. The result will inevitably be abandoned by the people of the whole country. This is beyond doubt. Moreover, the CCP's cruel and tyrannical behavior has aroused the people's unusual disgust and hatred, and it has become detached from the people of the whole country. We know that no force can survive without the people. This is a universal principle throughout history, both in China and abroad. The CCP specializes in threatening with killing, engaging in "struggle" and "liquidation" everywhere. The people have long been in extreme pain and wish to die together. Therefore, the people welcome the national army everywhere, assist the national army, and the vast number of youth voluntarily participate in the army to kill the bandits is also increasing. The recent rapid recovery of Yan'an, the old nest of the CCP, is the result of military-civilian cooperation. On the other hand, the demoralization of the Communist Party's military is also one of the reasons for its failure. Many young people were willing to join the Eighth Route Army in the past for the sake of resistance. The motive was originally pure, but now they have discovered that they have been forced to become bandits and regret it. Therefore, as long as there is an opportunity, they all rush to surrender to the national army. Even the power of the Communist bandits cannot stop this. This shows that the Communist bandits have become universally abandoned today and will soon collapse. Therefore, there is really no question about our ability to suppress the rebellion of the CCP.</p>
<p>Third, the direction of our current efforts, in addition to actively suppressing the rebellion and saving the people, is to earnestly strive to implement the Three Principles of the People and complete the task of national reconstruction. The purpose of the national revolution is to implement the Three Principles of the People, namely, to realize a national social system, a democratic political system, and a people's livelihood economic system, in order to establish a new China that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we believe that the implementation of nationalism has already achieved considerable success. As for democracy, since the successful conclusion of the National Assembly last year and the promulgation of the constitution, we believe that the implementation of democracy has a good foundation, but it still needs our efforts to realize it. As for the Principle of People's Livelihood, in addition to following the teachings of the Founding Father and implementing equal land rights and regulation of capital, the most important thing at present is to engage in productive construction. The youth of the whole country should pay attention to the improvement of production technology and strive for scientific research in order to change the old-fashioned thinking of scholars who "excel in learning and then become officials" and eliminate the bad phenomenon of the separation of knowledge and production, and the separation of hands and brains in the past. We must cultivate well-rounded knowledge youth who can use both their hands and brains, so that they can devote themselves to all departments of national production and construction, become pilots, engineers, primary school teachers, border reclamation workers, and village self-government members, taking on the darkest, most basic, most arduous, and most dangerous work. Only then can a new China based on the Three Principles of the People be quickly realized in our hands.</p>
<p>Youths across the nation, the road of revolution is tortuous and difficult, but it cannot stop us from moving forward. The cause of national reconstruction is arduous and complex, but it must not depress our spirit. As long as we recognize the revolutionary environment, hold firm to our revolutionary faith, and give full play to the revolutionary spirit, the era mission of revolutionary national reconstruction can be successfully completed in our hands."</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Representatives of Vocational Groups Petition the Legislative Yuan Yesterday; Continued Discussion of the Draft Law on Election and Recall of Legislative Yuan Members</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The Legislative Yuan continued to discuss the draft law on election and recall of Legislative Yuan members on the morning of the 29th. President Sun Ke said that the most intense dispute today was still over the issue of quotas. Fu Tongxian suggested increasing a clause for special national living habits in the inland according to the constitution. President Sun did not agree, believing that if all kinds of religious people participated, "the Legislative Yuan would become a religious convention." In order to establish a modern country, it is necessary to break this concept. Sun Jiulu also believed that if everyone was fighting for quotas for themselves, the issue of quotas would never be resolved. He hoped that everyone could adopt an objective attitude and discuss it calmly. Then, a vote was held, and it was resolved to increase the number of Mongolian representatives from the original 15 to 28, the number of Tibetan representatives from 8 to 10, the number of ethnic minority representatives from 5 to 6, and the number of overseas Chinese representatives from 16 to 19. When discussing the number of vocational representatives, Liu Butong pointed out that the implementation of constitutionalism is "returning power to the people, not returning power to the professions." Eight million vocational representatives can elect 56 people, which is not too few. Zhong Tianxin said that since vocational representatives call themselves "outstanding elements," they can compete in the regions. When discussing the proportion of women representatives, President Sun's wife arrived at this time, and the female legislators took the opportunity to speak up. Several male legislators argued on the basis of reason, and President Sun waved to signal that they could come forward to help. It was resolved to maintain the original plan, that is, for each quota of legislators with less than 10 seats, the quota for women to be elected is one, and for those exceeding 10 seats, there should be one woman elected for every 10 seats. At this point in the discussion, more than 200 vocational representatives held flags and came to the Legislative Yuan to petition. Liu Kejun and Lin Bin met with the representatives and persuaded them with polite words. The discussion continued in the Legislative Yuan. Chen Guyuan proposed a large electoral district method. Sun Ke and others believed that the method agreed upon the other day was only a technical district division that was inappropriate, and there was no problem in principle. If a large electoral district system is adopted, it will be difficult to recall legislators in the future. It was resolved to adjourn the meeting in the afternoon so that the Constitutional and Legal Committee could review this issue and submit it to the meeting on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Xie Zhigang is in Xi'an; Discussing Emergency Relief in Northern Shaanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Xi'an Office, 29th] Xie Zhigang, the supervisor sent by the Ministry of Social Affairs to Shaanxi, arrived here yesterday. Today, he is consulting with relevant parties to organize an emergency relief team to distribute 1.5 billion relief funds in the recovered areas of northern Shaanxi. Another meeting will be held on the 31st. After determining the detailed plan, the team will coordinate the handling.</p>
<h3>The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East; Temporary Headquarters Set Up in Shanghai; Approved by the United Nations Economic and Social Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 28th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today approved a resolution in the final batch of proposals to establish the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, composed of member states Australia, China, France, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Siam, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US. The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East enjoys the same powers as the Economic Commission for Europe. Both committees have the authority to take concerted action on economic recovery and development and to make recommendations to governments under the general scope of the Economic and Social Council. Its geographical scope includes British North Borneo, Sarawak, Burma, Ceylon, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Malaya, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Siam. However, the UK representative opposed the proposal by Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun to make Shanghai the temporary headquarters of the committee. The final resolution was that the first meeting of the committee should be held in Shanghai in the near future and a report on the investigation of facts in the Far East should be submitted to the first general meeting of the council in 1948. The aforementioned resolution to establish the Far East Economic Commission was approved surprisingly easily because the Soviet representative did not attend today's final meeting.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The United Nations Economic and Social Council voted today to approve Shanghai as the location of the temporary headquarters of the newly established Far East Economic Commission. Only the United Kingdom expressed opposition, citing the high cost of living in Shanghai. However, the UK's opposition was defeated by a vote of eleven to one in the council vote.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jiaxiang Summoned to Beijing to Report Dalian Situation to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] Zhao Jiaxiang, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Security Command Headquarters, was summoned by the Chairman and arrived in Beijing by plane at 5 p.m. on the 29th. He reported and requested instructions on the Dalian situation and takeover work. According to Zhao, "Dalian is not a local problem of the Northeast, but an overall problem of China. As for the various preparatory works before the takeover, Huang, the Chief Secretary of the Dalian Municipal Government Office stationed in Shenyang, has been actively preparing and everything is ready. However, the current situation in Dalian is still not as simple as it is rumored. Although the Soviet side has agreed to withdraw its troops from Dalian, there are still illegal armed forces entrenched there, engaging in sabotage. This is the biggest obstacle to the takeover work." Zhao is still very concerned about the takeover of Dalian. He will visit the Chairman and General Chen on the 30th, and also visit Foreign Minister Wang and Mayor Gong separately.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 29th] Zhao Jiaxiang and Zhang Tingmeng, Commander of the First Air Force District, flew to Beijing by special plane at 10:30 a.m. on the 29th and will return in four days.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 29th] As the takeover of Dalian approaches, Tai Shihui has convened meetings again in the past two days. Those who participated on the 28th included Zhao Jiaxiang, Zhang Jianfei, etc. Zhao's trip to Beijing is related to resolving the communist issue in the Lushun-Dalian area. In addition, Wang Zhimin has been appointed as the Deputy Director of the Datong Unified Takeover Branch.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 20th] Most of the Soviet troops in Jinzhou and Dalian have withdrawn south. There are only more than 200 Soviet troops left at Shihe Station, with one field gun. About 600 Soviet troops and more than 20 trucks are located at San Shili Pu south of Shihe. Twenty miles further south at Taitou, there is a Soviet baggage train, with an unknown number of soldiers. At Dafangshen Station south of Jinzhou, there are 1,200 Soviet troops, including a battalion of artillery, with more than ten artillery pieces. More than 10,000 Soviet troops are gathered at Xiajiahe southwest of Jinzhou, and about 1,000 Soviet troops are at Yingchengzi. The Datong materials and machinery, and locomotives, have been looted by the Soviets. Cotton, firewood and grain are now being shipped to Lushun all night long. Only three locomotives remain in Datong.</p>
<p>[Our Andong Dispatch, 29th] The joint management negotiations of the Andong Shuifeng Power Plant have not made any progress. The Soviet side sent a note to our side on the 27th, stating: This issue should be negotiated with the Korean side after the establishment of the Korean Joint Government. The Andong Police Bureau, which is responsible for the negotiations, is seeking instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to Major General Leikefu, who went to Korea last year to negotiate with the Soviet side, he hopes to agree on temporary management measures with the Soviet side.</p>

<h3>National Army in Northern Shaanxi Recovers Yanchuan, the Communist Remnants in the Suburbs of Yan'an Are Completely Eliminated, and the Communist Security Regiment North of Dazhai Is Annihilated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] The National Army, which advanced to the outskirts of Yanchuan, defeated the stubborn Communist army ten miles away from the city at 10 a.m. on the 29th, and entered the city at noon, immediately recovering the city.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to people from Yan'an, the Communist remnants in the suburbs of Yan'an have been completely eliminated by the National Army, and local order has been restored. Residents who were forced to leave by the Communist army are returning one after another, about 1,000 to 2,000 people every day. In addition, daily necessities in the city, which the Communist army did not have time to take away when they fled, were mostly buried underground and are now being searched for.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 29th] War News from Northern Shaanxi: (1) The Central Route National Army, with Wayaobao as its target, encountered the Communist Security Regiment at Xiaojiahe, north of Dazhai, on the morning of the 28th. The entire regiment of more than 1,000 men of the Communist 8th Army was annihilated. In the afternoon, more than 20 heavy artillery shells were fired at Wayaobao, and the left and right wings jointly launched an encirclement of Wayaobao. (2) The National Army under Yulin, taking Wujiapo in Mizhi County as the starting point, divided its troops to search for Renyicun and Hanjiacha in the east. The north and south National Army are now 180 li apart and will inevitably have a fierce battle in Suide before they can join forces. He Long, Lin Boqu, and others are all in Suide. More than 30,000 Communist troops continue to cross the river at the Wubu Ferry to Shanxi. (3) It is rumored that the city route National Army recovered Bao'an County on the 28th. The Communist army in the Sanbian area is facing pressure from the west, south, and north and has a tendency to withdraw east. Its "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Government" moved to Qingyangcha on the border of Anding Station on the 27th.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 28th] News from Yuxian, Mao Zedong and Zhu De arrived in Yuxian with cadres on the 17th. People fleeing from various military regions in the occupied area unanimously stated that the morale of the Communist cadres was extremely low after the National Army recovered Yan'an. Central Communist cadres in Mount Wutai called Xu Xiangqian "Xu the Traitor," for unknown reasons. A large number of wooden boats are concentrated between Yongheguan and Wubu. The Communist army in Suide Qingjian is collecting a large number of carpenters to build ships. A large number of wounded Communist soldiers in northern Shaanxi were transported eastward from the army ferry before the 26th, scattered in various villages in Lishi. On the afternoon of the 28th, an airplane reconnaissance revealed that there were more than 5,000 Communist troops and more than 200 donkeys between the army ferry and Kehuzhai, advancing along the north bank of the river. According to military authorities, judging from the recent war situation in northern Shaanxi, it is increasingly evident that the Communist Party lacks military talent. After the complete collapse of northern Shaanxi, the Communist army will inevitably retreat to northwestern Shanxi. However, northwestern Shanxi is sparsely populated and cannot be relied upon to fulfill its "entrepreneurial" ambitions. Escaping north to Inner Mongolia is tantamount to self-destruction, and advancing east to northeastern Shanxi will lead to easier annihilation. Although southeastern Shanxi is surrounded on the west side, it has a large area and population, and the output of coal, iron, and grain is abundant, making it more supportive to resist. It is also convenient to connect with the Communist army in Hebei and Shandong. In short, northwestern and northeastern Shanxi are both old nests of the Communist army, and even if the headquarters is moved to southeastern Shanxi, it will not be easily abandoned. The serious situation in Shanxi Province is on the eve of arrival.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guihua, 29th] (1) Tu Wang, the League Chief of Yikezhao League, sent Chizhongyi, a named Zhasak of the Junwang Banner, to Zhangjiakou on the 28th to visit Director General Fu, and reported on the recent situation of Yikezhao League. (2) Qi Yushan's troops recovered the western stronghold of Wushen Banner and are advancing south across the Hongliuliu River. (3) Ma Hongkui's troops have advanced to Huamachi and Sanduandi (within the territory of Duozake Banner), and the Communist army in Dingbian has been threatened.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Shandong Is at the End of Its Rope, Frequent Mobilizations Are Still Plotting to Invade Qingdao, National Army on the Jinpu Railway Is Conducting Extensive Sweeps</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 29th] The National Army on the left side of the Xu-Ji section of the Jinpu Line has been actively sweeping eastward since the two routes joined forces. As of the evening of the 29th, the remaining Communist army in the triangular area of Changqing, Feicheng, and Pingyin has been mostly eliminated. It is now echoing the National Army advancing north on the front of Dawenkou, actively advancing towards Zhangxia, Jieshou, Taian, and Dongbeibu. According to qualified estimators, the Jinpu front of Dawenkou Zhangxia can be cleared within half a month.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] On the Jinpu Line passing through Taian and south of Jinan, the Communist army's front line is shaken and reinforcements are being sent to resist at Qiweitou. The Communist army surrounding Jinan launched a fierce attack on the area east of Licheng on the night of the 27th. After a bloody battle all night, they were repelled by the National Army on the morning of the 28th. The periphery of Qingdao is becoming tense, and the Communist army is mobilizing frequently. The 5th and 6th Divisions and the 4th Brigade of the Jie were transferred east from the east of Huaixian, seemingly to increase the surrounding of Qingdao and prepare to attack Qingdao. The National Army has taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] From here through Changqing, Pingyin, Dong'e, Wenshang to the Jinning Line, since the National Army cleared it, Jinan is no longer an isolated city, and has gained another corridor area to connect with the outside world on land.

<h3>Shang Zhen's Talk in Tokyo: American Public Opinion Believes That Greater Assistance Should Be Given to Us; Feng Yuxiang Has Indeed Purchased a House in San Francisco</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] This morning, General Shang Zhen met with reporters here and said: American public opinion believes that greater assistance should be given to China at this time. He is returning to China via the United States. He said: Truman's recent call for full support for Greece and Turkey was criticized as conflicting with the US policy towards China, not only a few people pointed out its favoritism towards the Chinese Communist Party, but also the inappropriateness of expelling the Greek Communist Party. Shang said he had met with Marshall before Marshall went to Moscow, and Marshall said that the Moscow conference would not have any secret decisions affecting China's welfare. Shang discussed overseas Chinese in the United States, saying that there is an urgent need for a broad and comprehensive policy. He said that the current overseas Chinese are like lost sheep, and there is no doubt that they have patriotic enthusiasm. During the war, many overseas Chinese donated 80% of their savings to the government of their motherland. Their education has been seriously neglected. Their ignorance has led to actions that damage China's reputation. The biggest bad habits of ignorant overseas Chinese are opium smoking and gambling. When asked about Feng Yuxiang's recent activities, Shang Zhen confirmed the previous reports, that is, General Feng, who was ordered by the government to study river management in the United States, has purchased a house in San Francisco. Shang said that he was summoned back to China by Chairman Chiang and did not know if he would be able to return to the United States. Shang will take a boat to Shanghai this afternoon, along with more than a thousand overseas Chinese returning to their country.</p>

<h3>Completion of the New Dry Dock in Keelung: Ships with a Draft of Six Meters Can Enter the Dock for Repair</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Keelung, 29th] The ten-thousand-ton dry dock in Keelung Port was originally scheduled to hold a completion ceremony on March 2, but it was repeatedly postponed due to the "February 28th" incident. A simple ceremony was finally held. The ten-thousand-ton dry dock in Keelung Port was built by the Transportation Bureau of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office before the restoration. It officially started construction in April of the Republic of China Year 32 (1943) and was scheduled to be completed within two years. However, due to the intensification of the war, it was suspended in April of Year 34 (1945). A total of two years were spent, costing 2.1 million Japanese yen, but only three-quarters of the project was completed. The Taiwan Provincial Department of Transportation has been maintaining it since last June and completed it in February of this year. The dock is 165 meters long, 30.4 meters wide at the top, 22.4 meters wide at the bottom, and 12 meters deep. The mouth of the dock is 22 meters wide at the top and 10.6 meters deep. Ships with a draft of six meters can enter the dock for repair. The dock is equipped with a ten-ton crane and two electric winches. The pumping equipment uses the pumping room of the previously completed 20,000-ton dry dock in common. After the completion of the dock, Keelung Port will have a total of three large dry docks. The excellence of the ship repair equipment will be second only to Shanghai in China. The dock, along with the 20,000-ton and 3,000-ton dry docks, will continue to be leased and operated by the Taiwan Machinery Shipbuilding Company.

<h3>Full Text of Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>(8) Transportation 1. The central government should formally announce which railways are trunk lines and which are branch lines. The central government should fully operate the trunk lines, while the branch lines, under the management system of the central government, should be permitted and encouraged for local and private operation. 2. Highway construction, except for the national highways between provincial capitals, which should be built by the central government, the rest should be encouraged for construction by the provinces under the standards of the central government, with the central government assisting with financial and human resources. Certain branch lines should be encouraged by the provinces for construction by the counties. Highway transportation should be encouraged for private operation. 3. Airports should be operated by the government, and the aviation industry should be vigorously encouraged for private operation. 4. The central government should dredge the trunk waterways, the provinces should dredge the branch waterways, and the counties should dredge the smallest branch waterways. The central government should operate important ports, and the cities should operate secondary ports. All waterways and ports operated by the provinces and cities should be assisted by the central government with financial and human resources. The shipping industry should be encouraged for private operation as much as possible. 5. Telegraphs should be operated by the central government. Wireless stations for special needs in the sea and air, such as aviation and shipping, should be allowed to be set up by themselves under the management of the central government. 6. Long-distance telephone trunk lines should be laid by the central government, and provincial branch lines should be laid by the provinces, with the central government assisting. County and township branch lines should be laid by the counties, with the provinces assisting. 7. City telephones should be encouraged for private operation under the management that coordinates with long-distance calls.</p>
<p>(9) Finance 1. The government should quickly guarantee and support agricultural production to increase land tax revenue, guarantee and support industrial production to increase direct goods and consumption tax revenue, guarantee and support trade to increase customs revenue, and guarantee and support the salt industry to increase salt tax revenue. The financial strength of the entire nation should be supported by the production capacity and total income of hundreds of millions of people. 2. The central and local financial revenue and expenditure system revised last year has made county (city) level finances more ample than before, but provincial level finances, with less revenue and vast expenditures, are out of balance. The central competent authorities should consult with the provincial governments to revise the system to ensure that local financial resources are sufficient to meet the needs of self-reliance. 3. The current tax rates for direct goods, customs, and salt taxes are not suitable for the current economic environment, which is why tax sources cannot be fully grasped and the burden on the people is uneven. Adjustments should be made. 4. The tax collection agencies should be adjusted, current sources should be tightly controlled, and tax collection procedures should be simplified to eliminate long-standing malpractices and increase tax revenue. 5. Enemy and puppet properties and surplus materials that have not yet been sold should be sold off as quickly as possible. Production and transportation enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to the people or have their shares sold to increase revenue. 6. In addition to consolidating tax revenue, the national treasury should seek funds from the people by issuing securities and ensure that those with financial resources bear a greater burden. 7. The survival or abolition of agencies should be determined based on the needs of national construction. Overly large agencies must be streamlined, and overlapping agencies must be merged. 8. Expenditures that are not urgently needed by the country and that are not conducive to production and construction must be saved and stopped.</p>
<p>(10) Grain Administration 1. Starting from the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the collection and borrowing of grain from provinces and cities should be stopped to reduce the burden on the people. The principal and interest of grain borrowed in previous years should be repaid. The central government should refer to the local grain prices at the time of maturity to determine the discount rate and allocate legal tender for repayment, instead of offsetting it against land tax, so as to facilitate repayment. 2. In the 36th year of the Republic (1947), provinces and cities should continue to temporarily collect actual objects for land tax to meet the needs of the country, but in areas where grain production is poor and transportation is inconvenient, legal tender should be collected instead. The areas where legal tender is collected and the standards for collecting legal tender should be investigated and determined separately by the Ministry of Food based on the circumstances. 3. The actual objects obtained from land tax collection should be allocated by the central government to purchase the portion belonging to the provinces, cities, and counties according to the standards for collecting legal tender in nearby areas collecting legal tender. The public grain from provinces and counties collecting legal tender nearby should still be used locally and should not be purchased to facilitate the overall planning of military food and to take into account local needs. 4. The grain agencies in counties and cities collecting legal tender should be abolished, and their affairs should be handled by the county and city governments. The county and city agencies collecting actual objects and the provincial-level grain agencies should be retained, and their expenses should be fully borne by the central government. 5. The Changping granary system urgently needs to be established. The preliminary plans for building warehouses and storing grain in important locations in the Yangtze River basin must be completed within this year. Local grain storage should also be strengthened, promoted, and universally implemented to increase reserves. 6. The Farmers Bank of China should actively promote agricultural warehouse pledge, agricultural product storage, and agricultural product transportation and sales businesses in order to use financial strength to assist the government in supporting production, controlling grain sources, and regulating surpluses and deficits.</p>
<p>(11) Guiding Floating Capital into the Right Track The biggest problem in the current economy is that floating capital is concentrated in one place, competing for speculation. The direction of floating capital is driven by speculation. To bring the economy into a normal state, on the one hand, fundamental policies are needed. On the other hand, it is first necessary to overcome the dominance of floating capital. Therefore, guiding floating capital to participate in production is the current important plan. The methods are: 1. The national bank should coordinate with the production and construction plan, give low-interest loans and guarantees to legitimate enterprises, quickly and reliably, so that legitimate enterprises</p>
<p>(12) Absorbing Foreign Capital to Strengthen Production and Construction 1. The government should welcome foreign capital in a preferential manner to help the development of domestic industry. 2. Certain types of industries can be jointly operated with foreign capital. 3. Facilitate overseas remittances, give preferential and fair exchange rates, and encourage and protect overseas Chinese investment, providing convenience for them to establish various domestic industries. 4. Register the foreign exchange assets of nationals deposited abroad and use them for domestic production and construction.</p>
<p>(13) Reasonably Solving the Treatment of Officers, Soldiers, Public Education Employees 1. Implement a rationing system so that officers, soldiers, and public education employees can maintain the minimum necessary life. 2. The government is responsible for solving the education problems of the children of officers, soldiers, and public education employees. 3. Strictly implement the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same place to reduce the phenomenon of disparate treatment of employees in various agencies.</p>
<p>(14) Severely Punishing Behaviors That Use Political Power to Facilitate Private Enterprises If officials and businessmen are not separated and public interests are used for private gain, good economic policies can be distorted. If some private enterprises receive special treatment, legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises will be destroyed. This is a prerequisite for the effective implementation of economic policies and must be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>(15) Improving Economic Organizations In order to promote cooperation between the government and the people and make the implementation of economic policies as beneficial as possible, it is necessary to take care of the overall situation and make overall plans to prevent the financial and economic situations from being separated and being one whole. In the past, the various ministries of the Executive Yuan each acted on their own, and the Economic Committee and others were only nominally set up. The private sector had no way to communicate and express their responses to economic policies. To remedy this, the methods are: 1. The government should improve the organization of the National Economic Committee and be responsible for designing, supervising, and implementing economic policies. 2. On the social side, a broad economic construction movement should be launched to improve the public's understanding and interest in economic construction, and to eliminate the difficulties of economic construction with the power of official-private cooperation. (End)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Price Review Council at the Current Stage</h3>
<p>The organization of the Price Review Council has been approved by the Municipal Council meeting and will be established soon. Since the victory, this is the third change to this organization. The first time was in the winter of the year before last, the second time was in the summer of last year, and this is the third time. Examining its organization and verifying its powers, it appears to be increasingly strict.</p>
<p>Because the first and second organizations had no legal basis, especially the first time, even the disposal methods for violating the negotiated prices had no legal recourse. Of course, it was very difficult to implement them. Therefore, after one or two meetings, nothing happened.</p>
<p>The second time, which has been implemented continuously until now, although it has not achieved remarkable success, it cannot be said that it has no effect. This is because (1) when the municipal government suppressed rice prices last summer, it did its best to take emergency measures, trying its best to equalize prices and constantly implementing sales, rather than just making empty promises. (2) The regulations on cracking down on violations of price limits and negotiated prices were repeatedly invoked. (3) Important industries such as food, oil, sugar, and coal were organized separately and negotiated prices separately, which was more practical. Therefore, when price fluctuations and rising winds were gradually intensifying, this method was applied in a timely manner and achieved a considerable effect in alleviating the situation.</p>
<p>The reorganization this time is based on the Economic Emergency Measures Program (4) on prices and wages, and on the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations and the Price Review Implementation Program. The legal basis is very strong, and there are many differences from the above two resolutions, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This time, it is a national affair, which cannot be compared with the current local temporary measures. (2) The items for price negotiation are determined to be "main daily necessities," and others are not considered. The types are designated and announced by the local government in light of local conditions. (3) The procedures are strict, with provisions for preliminary review and review. (4) The disposal methods are clearly defined in accordance with the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations. (5) The composition of the members, in addition to the competent authorities and industry and commerce associations, also includes representatives of public opinion and security agencies, making the lineup relatively strong. (6) In addition to price evaluation, the powers of the Review Council also include "assisting in the behavior of violating negotiated prices," so that in addition to sitting and talking, it also has the responsibility to get up and act.</p>
<p>In short, the powers and scope of this new organization are clearer, and its content is richer. Therefore, it is expected to be more progressive than the present and the past when implemented. However, there are still a few issues that deserve to be reviewed beforehand, which are listed below:</p>
<p>1. Shanghai is the first industrial and commercial port in our country, and the situation is more complicated. Therefore, in terms of power, it is often difficult to achieve a unified effect because policies come from many sources. Merchants and people have to deal with them separately, and they often feel at a loss. For example, the Social Affairs Bureau also tried to negotiate prices for yarn and cloth in the past. However, in this port, the organization in charge of this matter is also the Textile Management Committee, and rayon is sold by the Central Trust Bureau. According to the actual situation, it seems that the price of yarn and cloth has been directly approved by the National Price Review Council. And gasoline, kerosene, etc., also have special circumstances. This state of divergence and complexity should be unified, and how to unify it should be studied.</p>
<p>2. Investigation and evidence collection Article 5 of the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations stipulates: "Regarding whether there are violations of price limits and negotiated prices, the police agency shall be responsible for the investigation in places where there is a police agency." This is not entirely consistent with the clause that the Review Council assists in reporting. Moreover, Article 5 of the Price Review Implementation Program and Article 3 of the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations stipulate that the competent authority is the Social Affairs Bureau in municipalities directly under the central government, but the Social Affairs Bureau has no clear provision for investigating alone or jointly. At the same time, the agencies responsible for investigation in Shanghai are not limited to the police bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, and sometimes they are not limited to local agencies. In order to facilitate the smooth implementation of the investigation and to reduce the doubts and troubles of merchants and people, this issue needs to be thoroughly clarified.</p>
<p>3. Re-negotiation Article 13 of the Price Review Implementation Program: When the cost of an item fluctuates sharply, and it is necessary to evaluate a new price, the price may be re-negotiated. However, the price shall not be increased before the negotiation and approval. This provision is of course very reasonable. However, the cost of items is now very easy to fluctuate sharply, and according to past practices, the evaluation of new prices often cannot keep up with market prices, resulting in black markets, disrupting the market, and making some of the so-called profiteers, hoarders, and speculators victims. At the same time, does the negotiated price follow the black market, or does the black market lead the negotiated price? It also loses the dignity of the negotiated price. This fact is commonly seen and heard, and it is really regrettable. After the implementation of the new price negotiation system, we do not want to see this kind of repeated mistakes being staged again and again. The key is that when the cost of the item does fluctuate sharply, the relevant merchants, especially the leaders of each industry, may as well collect all the documents and report honestly to the Review Council, applying for re-evaluation, and do not do it secretly and create a black market first. And the Review Council should also give sympathetic and reasonable consideration based on the facts. Do not put on a serious face and only talk official language, which will help promote the open black market.</p>
<p>4. Reporting according to law Anyone can report those who violate the approved negotiated price. This is clearly defined by law, but according to Article 4 of the Crackdown on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices Regulations, "Any informer who reports violations of price limits and negotiated prices listed in Article 2 shall have sufficient evidence to prove the violation, or other documents." Then, all kinds of empty talk or anonymous accusations can be ignored according to law. The intention of the legislation is of course to protect the good people and prevent them from being wronged or suffering unwarranted losses. The consideration is extremely thoughtful. This point is extremely important to the security of order and the spirit of the rule of law, and we hope that everyone will respect it. Fortunately, the Review Council is responsible for assisting in the reporting. If there is incomplete evidence! Or in the case of reports that are still doubtful, it may be handed over to the review committee for review first, in order to avoid wrongful or lenient handling and obtain a fair disposition.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Economic Emergency Measures Program takes stabilizing prices as its core, and stabilizing prices is achieved through the implementation of reviews. The task of the new Review Council this time is particularly important, which cannot be compared with the past and the present. Therefore, I have expressed my views briefly for public discussion. There is no need to rely on high-interest loans. 2. Stipulate the maximum amount of interest rates. High-interest loans exceeding the regulations will not be protected and will be punished. 3. During the transition period, national banks may as well absorb floating capital with the highest interest and transfer it to production. The government will subsidize the difference between the interest paid and received. 4. Allow people to purchase foreign exchange from the Central Bank at the listed price in gold for the purpose of purchasing approved imported goods, and allow gold to be used to preferentially purchase state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet properties sold by the government. 5. The government designates national banks to conduct gold savings deposits or issue gold bonds, all of which are given preferential interest and guaranteed, and a supervisory committee is specially formed to supervise them. 6. Crack down on speculation and manipulation and establish a sound and reasonable securities market.</p>

<h3>Marshall Suggests to the Council of Foreign Ministers That the Three Major Problems Should Be Resolved Quickly, and Minor Matters Should Be Submitted to a Special Committee for Research</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 29th] Authoritative sources learned today that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall has decided to force the Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers to make an early showdown on the German problem, so that it can be known on what basis the Soviet Union is willing to reach an agreement. This is the strategy behind Marshall's proposal last night, to ensure that future discussions are limited to what he calls the main issues, and to set April 2 as the "deadline" for resolving the stalemates on German economic unification, provisional government, and industrial reparations levels. According to Marshall's strategy, he is expected to continue to propose other deadlines as the meeting progresses. If there is still no success, Marshall may take action to suspend the negotiations and return home in mid-April. If its future is bright and there can be positive progress, he is willing to stay for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] The Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers today discussed the report submitted by the Adjustment Committee on the points that the Council of Foreign Ministers has reached an agreement and the points that have not been agreed upon. Marshall proposed that the report raise three categories of basic issues, and that other decisive issues be temporarily put aside. The so-called three categories of basic issues are (1) German economic unification; (2) the issue of reparations and the revision of German industrial levels; (3) the form and scope of the German provisional government. As for other decisive issues (such as the disarmament of Germany, the elimination of Nazis, and the issue of refugees), they should be handed over to a special committee for discussion, ordering it to submit a report on April 2 and to draft the instructions that should be given to the Allied Control Council. The British representative, Molotov, agreed with Marshall's proposal, but argued that the issue of reparations should be included in the first category, and that the decisive issue of disarmament should be included in the fourth category. The Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers finally decided to carry out the following four tasks at tomorrow's meeting: (1) to determine the points to be discussed in the Adjustment Committee's report; (2) to determine the points in the Adjustment Committee's report to be handed over to the expert committee for discussion; (3) to stipulate the deadline for the expert committee to discuss the points; (4) to discuss any one of the three categories of issues, which is probably the issue of German economic unification or the issue of reparations.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Attaches Importance to the Issue of Reparations, Which Is the Key to the Success or Failure of the Council of Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 29th] The Soviet Union has formally warned at the Council of Foreign Ministers that unless the Soviet Union's demands for reparations from Germany are met, there can be no agreement in the meeting based on any other basis, but the Soviet Union also revealed that it is willing to make some concessions on its demands for reparations. This was revealed in the report of the Adjustment Committee, which was submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers on Friday and will be discussed this afternoon or on Monday. Obviously, the issue of reparations is the focus of the entire German problem, not only whether the meeting can be successful, but also whether an agreement on the German problem can be reached as soon as possible will depend on this.</p>
<p>The main documents of the Soviet Union on the issue of reparations are: (1) The Soviet Union's statement in the adjustment report, "Part of the reparations should be paid by the current production." (2) The statement made by the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky in the Adjustment Committee on Thursday and Friday, in which he said that the Soviet Union believes that the issue of reparations is "extremely important," and the Soviet representative believes that the relationship between the economic problems and the issue of reparations is the closest.</p>
<p>Another Soviet document related to the issue of reparations stated that the Soviet Union believes that the profits obtained from German export trade, in addition to purchasing imported goods that can make Germany self-sufficient, should also be used to purchase imported goods for the production of reparations materials. The Soviet Union resolutely opposed the British and American proposal to use part of the export profits to make up for the previous deficits in western Germany. At the same time, it is reported that Marshall will reject the Soviet Union's proposal regarding reparations because the definition of German property in Austria has not been agreed upon.</p>
<h3>Five Minor Points of Economic Terms of Austrian Peace Treaty Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 28th] Foreign Minister representatives today reached an agreement on five minor points of the economic terms of the Peace Treaty, but no agreement has been reached on the remaining four points, including the return of Austrian property within the territory of the United Nations. The Foreign Minister representatives have also listened to the report of the Political Committee on the issue of refugees in Austria.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] The group of Foreign Minister representatives responsible for dealing with the German problem is scheduled to hear the opinions of Roof, Chairman of the Allied Commission on German Reparations, tomorrow. If necessary, the Four-Power Council of Foreign Ministers will also listen to his opinions.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] Australia had previously suggested that the United States should not begin trusteeship of the Japanese islands in the Pacific until after the signing of the Peace Treaty with Japan. This suggestion has been automatically withdrawn by Australia at today's meeting of the Security Council. It is also learned that the Security Council is scheduled to reconvene on April 2.</p>
<h3>Molotov Speaks Out Against Turkey</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 28th] At today's meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the organization of the Peace Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov condemned Turkey for declaring war on Germany only after it was certain that Germany would be defeated. He said that Turkey had assisted Germany during the war and profited from it. This is Molotov's first speech attacking Turkey after President Truman announced his plan to aid Greece and Turkey to resist Communism.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union is Willing to Provide Economic Aid to Britain</h3>
<p>Stalin Expressed to Bevin</p>

<h3>Halsey's Speech: Emphasizes Maintaining a Strong Navy</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 29th (Radio): U.S. Navy Admiral Halsey delivered an important speech today, stating that disarmament has failed in the past, and the United States must maintain the strongest navy in the world. Future wars may come with lightning speed, and we know this very well. The tragic lessons of Pearl Harbor have been forgotten by many, and following old ways will lead to a repeat of the Pearl Harbor incident.</p>
<h3>100,000 Germans in the Ruhr Region Hold a Famine Demonstration; British Side Claims it Clearly Has Political Undertones</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Dusseldorf, 28th] 100,000 men, women, old, and young, held the largest famine demonstration in the Ruhr region since the end of the war in this park today, holding slogans such as "No food, no work" and "Don't let our children starve." During the march, the crowds overturned several British military vehicles, and the military vehicle carrying British journalists was also pelted with stones. The local labor union issued a general strike order for one day, paralyzing all transportation in the city and shutting down all factories. From early morning, large numbers of workers, housewives, and children appeared on the streets. Around 11:00 AM, more continued to arrive, and they shouted abuse at any British soldiers they encountered. Demonstrators also parked several trucks at the entrance of the park to prevent British military vehicles from passing. Horses and carriages also participated in the demonstration. The chairman of the Dusseldorf Labor Union Committee broadcast to the crowd in the park, saying that the union would not stop until the current tragedy was overcome and the conscience of the world was aroused. Another speaker shouted, "No work until more food is obtained," which drew cheers from the entire crowd. There was also a smaller demonstration in Essen this morning, and there were also instances of work slowdowns and demonstrations in other cities in the Ruhr region, but all demonstrations were orderly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Dusseldorf, 28th] A senior British official said that the famine demonstration and strike in the Ruhr region have political undertones, intending to influence the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. If there were no food crisis, such events would not have occurred. However, the initiators are using this situation to draw more attention to the Moscow Conference. The current events in the Ruhr region are clearly not orchestrated by Nazis.</p>
<h3>Bollaert's Arrival Speech Indicates Determination to Make Vietnam Join the Federation</h3>

Its sole purpose is to develop their respective cultures, improve happiness, and obtain security." Ramadier immediately replied with a letter wishing him success.</p>
<h3>At the UN General Disarmament Committee Meeting, Guo Taiqi Delivers a Speech, Emphasizing that Building Peace Should Be Pursued on Two Fronts</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] Chinese representative Guo Taiqi warned the United Nations today at the UN General Assembly's subcommittee on conventional armaments that the United Nations' efforts to build peace should not be done gradually. He advocated that world disarmament and world security should go hand in hand to achieve complementary effects. He stated: The United Nations should immediately complete the efforts of its Military Committee to build peace, so that atomic energy can be used for peaceful purposes and conventional armaments can be abolished. The disarmament agency should establish two main subcommittees, one responsible for preventing violations of armament reduction, and the other dedicated to reducing land, sea, and air forces or military expenditures. Due to the differing opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament, Guo Taiqi specifically put forward this proposal to fulfill his mediation mission. Western countries advocate that armament reduction should only be implemented after the UN security forces are developed and their ability to maintain peace is strengthened, while the Soviet Union advocates that world armaments should be abolished first.</p>
<h3>Austin Explains the True Meaning of US Aid to Greece; Soviet Representative Temporarily Does Not Respond, Saying He Needs Sufficient Time to Consider</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 28th] Just as US representative Austin was about to present the US's views on the Greek issue to the Security Council, Soviet representative Gromyko suddenly stood up to oppose the US issuing a statement, pointing out that the statement was not within the scope of the Greek issue on the Security Council's agenda and should be regarded as a new proposal to be discussed on another date. After briefly discussing the procedure with the chairman, Austin still stood up and spoke, formally requesting the UN agencies to approve the US's aid to Greece and Turkey and take active steps to protect any country from the threat of aggression, and to establish a permanent border "monitoring group" on the northern border of Greece. When Austin finished his speech, the entire hall was silent and tense, and everyone's eyes were on Gromyko, waiting to see how he would respond. However, Gromyko only said: "I have just heard the important statement made by the United States on an important issue and need to study it thoroughly. I will present my views at the next meeting." The next meeting was scheduled for April 7. Thereupon, the representatives resumed discussion of the US's request to administer the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. India, Australia, the Philippines, Canada, and Norway agreed with the US proposal, while New Zealand indicated that it still wanted to wait for the signing of a peace treaty with Japan. Finally, it was decided to adjourn the meeting until next Wednesday for further discussion.</p>
<p>Soviet Union May Adopt New Tough Policy</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] The Soviet Union's current use of the veto in the Security Council is seen by some as a sign that the Soviet Union is adopting a new tough policy and will not allow the Council to bully countries within the Soviet sphere of influence. The Soviet Union's veto of the British complaint against Albania for laying mines in the Corfu Channel was the tenth time it had used its veto power, but the first time in more than six months. At the same time, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in important meetings of the Trusteeship Council, and Soviet representative Gromyko's unwavering insistence on considering Soviet proposals supported by the minority in the Atomic Energy Control Commission, further reinforce the impression of a tough Soviet policy.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Greece and Turkey: Some Congressmen Oppose</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Members of Congress who criticize President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey today concentrated their attacks, seeking to eliminate or reduce the portion of the $400 million allocated to Turkey. Democratic Senator Johnson told reporters: "Supporting the anti-communist cause in the Mediterranean region may lead to war. I plan to fully oppose giving any aid to Turkey. I strongly favor completely excluding Turkey. According to the proposal, Greece is just a sweet bait to induce Congress to aid Turkey in preventing Soviet invasion of the Dardanelles. I support helping the Greek people, but I do not support military aid to the current Greek government or Turkey." According to Assistant Secretary of State Clayton, $150 million has been allocated to Turkey to strengthen and maintain its military.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The head of the US economic delegation to Greece, Pender, recently requested the House Foreign Affairs Committee to approve the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey, as Greece is currently living on borrowed money.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg announced: The Senate will debate the US aid to Greece and Turkey bill on April 7.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] Congress is currently planning to recess for Easter, so the $400 million aid bill for Greece and Turkey may not be finalized until after April 15. The $350 million aid bill for China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Austria, and Poland will also be temporarily shelved. In addition, the $550 million aid bill for US occupied areas may also have difficulty reaching a quorum when the House of Representatives votes on it next week.</p>
<h3>US House Approves $300 Million for Relief in US Occupied Areas; Hodge Fiercely Criticizes Soviet Troops in North Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] The House Appropriations Committee today approved $300 million in emergency relief funds for US occupied areas, including $144 million for Japan, $68 million for Korea, $67 million for Germany, and the remainder for Austria and Italy. During the committee's hearings, US military commander in southern Korea, Hodge, strongly condemned North Korea, claiming that the US and Soviet occupied zones in Korea are now separated by an "absolute curtain," and reports indicate that the Soviets have 500,000 "strong" troops in North Korea. Republican Congressman Keefe asked: "Once the work of improving and building South Korea is completed, will the 500,000 Korean troops trained by the Soviet Union march south and occupy the entire country?" Hodge replied: "This could happen. I share your concerns." Undersecretary of the Army Patterson outlined the relief process for each occupied area, stating, "If we do not support these people, they will inevitably fall into chaos and become the best breeding ground for communism. Please note that we are competing with communism all over the world, and it is a very real competition."</p>

<h3>US Communist Party Obeys Moscow and Attempts to Overthrow the US Government: Report from the House Un-American Activities Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 29th (Radio): The House Un-American Activities Committee has submitted a report of over 20,000 words to Congress, formally accusing the US Communist Party of directly obeying orders from Moscow, attempting to overthrow the US government, and stating that the activities of the US Communist Party are only one of the sixty-seven groups worldwide that carry out orders from the Moscow Communist Party Executive Committee. Committee Chairman Thomas said: "The purpose of this report is to make Congress and the public aware that the US Communist Party is Moscow's fifth column." The committee has held consecutive meetings to discuss laws to stop Communist Party activities or deny the party's legal status. The report did not suggest any methods for dealing with the Communist Party, but reliable sources said: "The committee has abandoned the idea of denying the Communist Party's legal status, as this would make Communist Party activities go underground, making them more difficult to detect, and it is questionable whether this move is in line with the spirit of the Constitution."</p>
<p>[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 29th (Radio): Canadian Minister of National Defence Claxton made a speech, accusing the Canadian Communist Party of carrying out Soviet orders, "disloyal to Canada," and saying, "Since the Soviet Union does not allow us to enter its borders to investigate and report on the country's situation, and does not allow its people to know the real situation here, it is because the situation in that country cannot be compared with the situation in our country."</p>
<h3>House Un-American Activities Committee to Investigate Hollywood</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Chairman Thomas of the House Un-American Activities Committee announced today: "The committee will undertake an 'investigation of Hollywood'." However, Committee member Nixon said that there are many important areas that need immediate investigation. First is the list of government officials, and second are the labor unions. From the perspective of US defense, these two places are extremely important. In addition, Johnston, president of the Motion Picture Association, testified to the committee yesterday, saying that although there are Communist Party members in Hollywood, "if they launched a plot to occupy the film city, they would be doomed to failure." The film industry is trying to rectify its internal affairs, but he strongly opposes the idea that male and female actors should be dismissed simply because they are Communist Party members. "They are indeed acting in conspiracy scripts, but in the United States, they can only be reported, not persecuted."</p>

<h3>Mayor and Speaker Encourage Youth to Commemorate Revolutionary Martyrs and Celebrate Youth Day, Completing the Task of National Reconstruction and Maintaining World Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang and the 4th Youth Day. All sectors of the city, in addition to hanging the county flag in commemoration, all institutions and schools were closed for one day. A grand commemorative ceremony was held at the City Stadium at 10:00 AM, attended by more than 2,000 representatives from all walks of life. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Youth League Secretary-General Wu, City Chamber of Commerce Xu Jiqing, City Party Headquarters Wang Xianqing, Xie Dahuang, Finance Bureau Hu Wenyuan, Health Bureau Zhang Wei, General Labor Union Shui Xiangyun, Women's Association Qian Jianqiu, Education Association Zhou Feicheng, and others served on the presidium of the conference. After performing the ceremony, a three-minute silence was held for the revolutionary martyrs and the war dead in Hangzhou, followed by a speech by Chairman Wu, who said: "The history of China in recent years can be divided into three stages. The first is the revolutionary stage, in which the Father of the Nation led the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the establishment of the Republic of China, and the defeat of the warlords. The second is the anti-Japanese war stage, in which President Chiang led the resistance against aggression, defeated Japanese imperialism, and achieved final victory. The third is the stage of national reconstruction. I hope that the youth of the country will specialize in academic research to complete this task of national reconstruction. Revolution requires great courage, the anti-Japanese war emphasized sacrificing oneself for righteousness, while the national reconstruction stage relies on intelligence, so that science and industry are developed, culture and education are popularized, catching up from behind to restore the glorious history of China over the past five thousand years, and shouldering the responsibility of leading world culture to move forward." Mayor Wu giving a speech at the memorial meeting</p>

<p>Speaker Pan then gave a speech, saying: "Chinese youth have shouldered the three missions of revolution, the Northern Expedition, and the anti-Japanese war in the past, sacrificing and fighting to achieve success. As for today, the responsibility of Chinese youth is even greater, because they not only have to build the country, but also maintain world peace. We should open our eyes and see if there are any factors that could lead to a lack of peace in every corner of the world? Will China become a powder keg for a lack of peace after national reconstruction! To ensure that China does not become a powder keg, the youth need to fulfill their great responsibility. The Second World War broke out in the Balkans because there were weaknesses in that area that could be invaded by others. In fact, China's 'September 18th Incident' was a hidden cause, and the 'July 7th' Marco Polo Bridge Incident was a proximate cause. To avoid the outbreak of a third world war, we must at least ensure that China no longer has a weakness that can be invaded by others. Young people should pay special attention to their responsibilities and seek advanced knowledge. The Third Plenary Session declaration had instructions, and today's Youth Day President Chiang's message to the youth of the country also stated that to build the country, we must first seek advanced knowledge, instructing the youth on how to maintain world peace. I hope that the youth of the country will work together."</p>
<p>Wu Shaoshu said in his speech: "Today's youth in China, in addition to praying for peace and improving the standards of culture and physique, also hope that democratic politics can be truly implemented, and that both learning and life can be stabilized." Xie Dahuang, representative of the City Party Headquarters, said: "History is written by the hot blood of generations of young people. Starting from Huanghuagang, through the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, the May 30th Movement, and the eight-year anti-Japanese war, countless sacrifices were made to achieve glorious victory. As history progresses page by page, the historical tasks undertaken by the youth are also different. Today, what China needs is not destruction, but unification and stability. Therefore, I hope that the youth will exert their strength to stabilize society and unify the country." After the speeches, Mayor Wu presided over the distribution of awards to the winners of the youth cross-country race. Then, the entire audience shouted slogans and played music, completing the ceremony. After the meeting, there was also a motorcade parade.</p>
<p>In addition, the Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Special Party Department, and the Seamen's Party Department also held commemorative ceremonies yesterday.</p>

<h3>Ten Shanghai Vocational Groups Strive for National Assembly Delegate Seats</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Farmers Association, Fishermen's Association, Education Association, Lawyers Association, Accountants Association, Doctors Union, Shanghai Branch of the Industrial Association, and Labor Association, ten vocational groups, upon hearing news of a reduction in the number of vocational representatives to the National Assembly, jointly telegraphed the government yesterday, striving for the number of vocational representatives to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The original text reads: "To the Nanjing National Government, Executive Yuan, and Legislative Yuan: The originally scheduled quota of vocational representatives to the National Assembly is only 450, which, calculated according to the huge amount of taxes paid to the state by the agricultural, commercial, and industrial sectors, already feels inadequate. If it is further reduced, it would be obviously unfair, and our associations cannot accept it. We dare to ask you to pay attention to the importance of production and national construction. If you cannot increase the quota, you must maintain the original quota. If there is a reduction, we would rather leave the seats vacant. We apologize for our hasty words. Please consider our request."</p>

<h3>New Jiangsu Commissioner to Assume Office in Two Days; Meeting with Reporters and Sharing Thoughts, Hoping for Peace and Tranquility</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The newly appointed Jiangsu Commissioner, Yan Zhuang, is scheduled to assume office on April 1st. Yesterday, during a meeting with reporters, he stated: "Jiangsu, being the area surrounding the capital, is the political, economic, and cultural center of our country, holding an extremely important position. I hope that in the future, the Commissioner's Office can be as peaceful and uneventful as the old-style government offices, as this would indicate that politics are on the right track. I studied in Shanghai in my early years and am quite familiar with the situation in this city. The situation in Shanghai is very complex, and its importance to the nation is unmatched by any other city. Every move in Shanghai leads and influences the entire country. If China wants to get on the right track, Shanghai must get on the right track first. This applies to both good and bad aspects. For example, if there is speculation fever in Shanghai, other places will follow suit. Moreover, there are numerous schools in this city, and the number of students is the highest in the country. If the current social situation is too unsatisfactory, young students will become radicalized due to dissatisfaction with reality, which would be a great loss to the country. Therefore, people from all walks of life in Shanghai bear a particularly heavy responsibility to the country. All responsible officials in this city, starting with Mayor Wu, are exceptionally talented, which is why they have achieved remarkable political achievements that are praised both domestically and internationally. After I take office, I will have many opportunities to interact with them."</p>
<p>When asked about the financial difficulties of the Commissioner's Office, Mr. Yan replied: "In terms of regular expenses, the monthly budget is only 1.7 million yuan, which makes it difficult to carry out our work. However, I understand that the Control Yuan has now approved an investigation fund of nearly 200 million yuan. Once it is allocated, this office can expect to receive a portion of it, and we will be able to actively carry out all inspection and investigation work. As far as Jiangsu Province is concerned, after the recovery of Northern Jiangsu, order has not been fully restored, and there are still many problems. Therefore, there is a need to first inspect the counties in Northern Jiangsu."</p>

<h3>Yang Wendao's Second Son Killed by Truck</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yang Wendao, who was unjustly imprisoned for ten years, had his second son, Yang Hanye, unfortunately killed by a truck belonging to the Central Shipbuilding Factory of the Resources Commission at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Wujin Road yesterday morning.

<h3>China's Largest Warship, the Emei, Open for Tours; Equipped with Radar and Other Latest Equipment; Hospital, Workshop, and Kitchen are Exquisitely Equipped</h3>
<p>[Our Report] China's largest warship, the Emei, with a displacement of 15,000 tons, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last month and is docked at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Gaochangmiao Navy for repairs to its machinery and cleaning of its hull. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the ship invited members of the Shanghai news media for a tour. Captain Liang Xuzhao and other officers warmly welcomed the visitors. After the tour, the reporters were sent back by landing craft at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Emei warship was originally the US Navy oil tanker USS Mamie. US Navy Admiral Nimitz served as the ship's first chief engineer. During his tenure, he injured a finger in the ship's engine room, which is still a popular anecdote. The ship was commissioned in October 1916 and participated in World War I, becoming the first US Navy transport ship to use diesel fuel. In 1942, with the outbreak of World War II, the ship was re-equipped, so all the equipment on board, such as the main engine, various combat instruments, radar, depth sounder, and long-range direction finder, are the latest modern equipment.</p>
<p>Last summer, the United States donated eight ships, including the Taikang, which were escorted by the Emei on their voyage across the Pacific back to China to provide supplies and repairs. After arriving in China, the US government ordered the ship to be transferred to China. The Chinese Navy Bureau sent outstanding officers and soldiers to Qingdao in November last year to take over the ship and renamed it the Emei.</p>
<p>The Emei is a mixed-use supply ship with a total displacement of 14,750 tons, a length of 475 feet, a width of 16.5 feet, and a maximum speed of 13 knots. It is equipped with five 3-inch guns, two 40-mm anti-aircraft guns, and eight 20-mm anti-aircraft guns. The ship has a small hospital with medical facilities such as an operating room, pharmacy, and wards, staffed by two medical officers. There is also a repair workshop with more than ten machine tools, iron beds, sawing machines, and lathes from 1942. There is also a refined small kitchen that specializes in making Chinese and Western pastries. The ship also has washing machines and ironing machines, which are not easily seen on land.</p>
<p>There are 363 officers, soldiers, and naval academy students on board for shipboard training. The organization consists of the captain and deputy captain, followed by seven groups: ship affairs, communications, gunnery, supply, engineering, medical, and repair, each responsible for the affairs of the entire ship. All officers and soldiers on the ship rise at 5:30 AM for morning exercises and cleaning, and then have breakfast at 6:45 AM before going to their respective posts. Lunch is at 11:45 AM, followed by a rest, nap, or reading books and magazines in the library. Dinner is at 5:45 PM, and bedtime is at 9:30 PM. The ship has projection equipment, but it is difficult to rent films. Although there are a few movies, they have been watched by all the officers and soldiers on the ship, so the captain hopes that the Central Film Studio can lend some new films to alleviate the monotonous life on board. When asked about their salaries, all the officers and soldiers shook their heads and smiled bitterly. Enlisted men receive only 20,000 yuan per month, naval soldiers receive 80,000 yuan per month, and officers receive no more than 160,000 yuan per month, which is far less than the US$300-400 per month that officers received while training in the United States (all officers and soldiers were trained in the United States), making them keenly aware of the difference between then and now. (The picture below shows the majestic appearance of the Emei. Photo by our newspaper.)</p>

<h3>Zhengda University Student Strike Nears Deadlock; Ministry of Education Commissioner Cheng Qibao Fears Dissolution; Jiangxi Education Director Zhou Bangdao Considers One Last Effort</h3>
<p>[Our Nanchang Dispatch from the 29th] The student representatives of each department of Zhengda University have once again voted against resuming classes by a margin of seven votes. This student strike, after repeated persuasion from all parties, has been ineffective in mediation. Now that it has evolved to this point, it seems to be nearing a deadlock. Ministry of Education Commissioner Cheng Qibao stated that he will immediately report the situation to the ministry for instructions. He said that the future is not optimistic and fears that it will lead to dissolution. Some parties also criticize the students for being stubborn, not listening to advice, missing the opportunity, and inevitably regretting it later. Currently, Director Zhou Bangdao of the Jiangxi Education Department plans to make a third and final effort.</p>
<h3>First National Education Demonstration Zone to Establish Branch Office</h3>
<p>The First National Education Demonstration Zone in this city has been established in Lixing, Pudong for a year.

There are a total of 132 classes in the area, with 5,986 students, accounting for 89.5% of school-age children. Only 692 children are out of school. Director Gu of the Municipal Bureau of Education believes that education in the area has developed considerably. In order to assist the educational development of the southern Yangjing area, it has been decided to expand the First National Education Demonstration Zone to the entire Yangjing area starting from April 1st. This measure has been strongly supported by Wang Yigeng, the new district chief. It is reported that after obtaining the consent of Mr. Pan Zhiwen, a local gentleman in the district, a branch office will be established in Yangjing Town to assist the district office in jointly promoting the work of national education.</p>

<h3>The Fate of Children is in Your Hands</h3>
<p>— Chen Heqin</p>
<p>In Commemoration of the 36th Teachers' Education Movement Week</p>
<p>Respected Teachers:</p>
<p>Have you ever thought that the fate of children is in your hands?</p>
<p>This means that you are very capable of controlling everything about the children.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the situation of children in school.</p>
<p>School is the children's small world. Children should be very happy there. They learn various subjects there, obtain knowledge from all sources, and prepare to dedicate themselves to the big world of the future. However, it is undeniable that we can often see or hear that some children are not very interested in the school's courses. Some children hate arithmetic, some dislike social studies, and some children dislike music and other subjects. The root cause of these problems can be summed up in one sentence: "The teacher harmed him!"</p>
<p>Ask your own or someone else's child: "Why are you not happy to learn arithmetic?" He will definitely answer you, "The teacher doesn't teach well!" Ask another one, and he will squint his eyes and grumble to you in the same way: "It's not that I don't like social studies, it's that the teacher didn't teach well. I don't understand, so I'm not happy to learn it!"</p>
<p>This is the "problem". Have you ever planned for your own or someone else's child? It is a natural right for children to receive knowledge of nature and society. We should help him, and never let him give up naturally.</p>
<p>Good teachers make good children, and teachers who teach well naturally make children learn well. A teacher with appropriate teaching methods can definitely avoid increasing the child's difficulties. Similarly, a child who is good in all subjects must have received reasonable guidance from an excellent teacher. All of this determines everything about the child, so I want to say that the success or failure of children in learning is entirely in the hands of teachers or parents; it's on you.</p>
<p>The fate of children is in your hands, this is the first point.</p>
<p>Let's talk about how to teach children to be good people.</p>
<p>You must first do what you want the children to do. Children are born ignorant and don't know what is good and what is bad. Their every move can be said to be influenced by heredity, constrained by the environment, and governed by education. In his entire educational stage, the most important thing is of course the teacher. If you want children to be polite, you must first look at your own politeness. You must first treat people the way you want children to treat people. Children are your mirror. Your every move can be reflected in the children's mirror. For example, if you are a pessimistic person, looking at things with pessimistic eyes, then the children you teach will definitely be pessimistic. If your attitude is optimistic, then the children you teach will also be optimistic.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate these aspects! Even in very small places, we teachers or parents must set an example in everything we do, and set an example for the children to see. Treat people, not only in words and actions, but even in your thoughts and emotions, you must set an example.</p>
<p>That's the second point. Enough, we can count a lot more, I'll leave it to you to think about and appreciate.</p>
<p>Whether your own or someone else's child becomes a good citizen or is harmful to society is entirely up to you to decide. Please remember my words:</p>
<p>"The fate of children is in your hands!"</p>
<h3>Lou Wen'ao Wins Youth Cross-Country Race; Qiu Xingqing Second Place; Lu Honggao Third Place; Time 33 Minutes 29 Seconds</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Branch of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, in commemoration of the revolutionary martyrs and to celebrate Youth Day, jointly organized a youth cross-country race with the Municipal Stadium and the Municipal Youth League. The route was approximately 10,000 meters. It started at 7:52 AM in front of the Youth League branch on Zhongzheng South Road. The city police patrol team and the Boy Scouts from Siwei, Gezhi, and Shibei schools assisted along the way. Tens of thousands of spectators lined the streets. Roll call was at 7:30 AM, with 34 participants. After a strenuous 10,000-meter race, Lou Wen'ao won with a time of 33 minutes and 29 seconds, breaking his own record of 36 minutes and 40 seconds from the previous year (the previous year's race involved wading through water on a section of Daxilu after rain). Qiu Xingqing came in second with 37 minutes and 54 seconds, and Lu Honggao came in third with 38 minutes and 39 seconds. Commemorative medals were awarded to all 30 finishers. The top ten were also awarded prizes. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Competition Details</p>
<p>In the warm spring weather, the starting gun fired at 7:52 AM, and 68 swift feet sprinted out. At that time, the racers were in high spirits, all with the ambition and posture to take the lead. Lou Wen'ao took the lead from Zhongzheng South to Fuxing Road. Qiu Xingqing, Lu Honggao, and others stayed close behind. As they turned onto Maoming Road, Lou was running alone alongside the guide car. By the time they reached Nanjing West Road, only 30 people remained. Qiu, Lu, and Lin Canran and others were already hundreds of meters behind. Lou looked quite relaxed. As they entered Huashan Road via Jiangsu Road, the mute Lou led by a clear 1,000 meters. As the racers approached the willow branches along Beidang Road, they were increasingly energized knowing that the destination was not far away, and the competition intensified.</p>
<p>Turning onto Shaanxi South Road from Avenue Lafayette, they were already very close to the finish line. Lou strode forward and made a 50-meter sprint, reaching the entrance of the Municipal Stadium first, finishing the 33 minutes and 29 seconds, the audience applauded. Qiu Xingqing was second with 37 minutes and 54 seconds, and Lu Honggao was third with 38 minutes and 39 seconds. A total of 30 people completed the entire course. Mr. Yang Wangde finished last, with a time of one hour, four minutes, and forty seconds, and the audience applauded. "Number 13" Li Guangfu took off his vest halfway through the race and ran shirtless, which caught the attention of passersby and was the most unconventional sight of the day.</p>

<h3>Reliable Guarantee of US Dollar Bonds; Subscription and Sales Methods Agreed Upon; Central Bank Commissioned by the Ministry, Guaranteeing No Mandatory Allocation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago, immediately discussed public debt matters with Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank. Mr. Chen met with our newspaper's reporter yesterday and spoke about the government's issuance of US dollar treasury bonds, stating: "I was ordered to come to Shanghai this time to discuss the subscription and sales methods of the US dollar treasury bonds with President Zhang of the Central Bank, as well as the organization of the fund management committee. I met with President Zhang for two hours on the morning of the 29th, and we have largely reached an agreement. I am scheduled to return to Beijing today (the 30th) to report to Minister Yu for approval." The discussions with President Zhang included: (1) Rules for the receipt and issuance of invoices for treasury bond subscriptions and sales. (2) Organizational regulations for the fund management committee. (3) Organizational rules for local subscription and sales committees, and other related matters. It is planned to announce these after approval before April 1st. Regarding the fund management committee, we will strive to strengthen its organization to consolidate creditworthiness and protect the rights and interests of bondholders. As for the candidates for the fund management committee, in addition to the regulations stipulating that various agencies and organizations will recommend a certain number of representatives, the Ministry of Finance will separately invite responsible persons from other relevant agencies and organizations to participate and jointly bear responsibility.</p>
<p>As for the subscription and sales of treasury bonds, it is planned that the Ministry will commission the Central Bank to handle them. The Central Bank may establish subscription and sales committees in various locations to promote them. In terms of collection, in addition to Central Banks in various locations, other banks and firms may be designated to collect bond payments on behalf of the Ministry. We will strive for universal sales so that all sectors in all regions have the convenience of purchasing. These treasury bonds will all be freely subscribed and will definitely not be allocated mandatorily. The government's issuance of treasury bonds this time aims to solve economic problems through economic means, that is, to improve the economic conditions of issuance as much as possible. For example: (1) A principal-protected method will ensure that bondholders can maintain the actual value of their investment in public debt. (2) The interest rate is generous, unprecedented. (3) All subscription and sales and fund management will be conducted openly to demonstrate great trust. (4) The proceeds from the treasury bonds will all be used for productive construction. (5) It is determined that the funds securing the treasury bonds all have reliable collateral. For example, the treasury bonds are secured by state-owned production enterprises and seized enemy and puppet assets. The public debt is secured by the Central Bank's foreign exchange fund, all of which are extremely reliable. (6) A fund committee will be established to be responsible for handling fund management matters, in order to consolidate the bonds and protect the rights and interests of bond purchasers.</p>
<p>In short, the government's issuance of treasury bonds this time aims to absorb the floating capital of the people at home and abroad to reduce issuance, stabilize finance, enrich the foreign exchange fund, and regulate foreign trade. If sales can proceed smoothly, it will greatly benefit the country's current financial and economic difficulties. This measure is beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people, and I believe that all sectors will definitely subscribe enthusiastically. All the regulations for issuance can demonstrate that the government has made its greatest efforts. When bidding farewell to the reporter, Mr. Chen solemnly stated again: "During the Legislative Yuan's meeting to discuss the US dollar treasury bond regulations, Minister Yu also attended to explain and earnestly told the legislators: 'I am willing to use the position of Minister of Finance to guarantee the credit of these treasury bonds.'"</p>
<h3>The City's Jewelry Industry Held a Temporary Discussion Meeting Yesterday; Decided to Resume Business on the 1st; Plans to Petition Again</h3>
<p>The city's jewelry industry has been temporarily suspended since the implementation of the economic emergency measures on the 17th of last month, and more than a month has passed in an instant. After petitioning in Beijing twice, the Ministry of Finance has now announced the measures for the sale of gold jewelry. The industry held a temporary discussion meeting at the industry association at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Yao Lianfang, with more than a dozen representatives from large and small businesses participating. The following key matters were discussed and decided: (1) All jewelry stores in the city will officially resume business on April 1st. (2) The purchase price of gold jewelry will be 4.8 million yuan per tael based on the Central Bank's listed price, and the selling price will follow the Mayor Wu's approved profit of 90,000 yuan per tael, totaling 5.7 million yuan. (3) The labor cost is tentatively set at 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per mace for rough work, and fine work will be discussed separately.</p>
<p>Preparing to Petition</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the industry association, the industry has decided to reluctantly resume business first in order to maintain the livelihood of its employees. The biggest difficulty in future business is the extreme shortage of original gold. It is hoped that the authorities can provide it appropriately; otherwise, if the gold jewelry stored by the industry is sold, it will inevitably be impossible to replenish it, and business will be difficult to develop. Now, after resuming business, they are preparing to continue petitioning the central government.</p>
<p>Representatives Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>After the jewelry industry was suspended this time, representatives from the same industry in various provinces, cities, and counties across the country came to Shanghai to connect and collectively petitioned in Beijing. Now that the problem has come to an end, and the jewelry industries in Beijing and Shanghai have successively resumed business, all the representatives from various places such as Beiping, Tianjin, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Jiangsu are leaving Shanghai separately in recent days. As of yesterday, only Hunan representative Gan Yiting and Hankou representative Zou Jingxuan are scheduled to return next week.</p>
<h3>A Large Amount of Gold is About to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It is learned that an American ship is carrying as much as thirteen tons of gold from San Francisco, setting a new record for gold imports in the past. The company carrying the gold has notified the Central Bank to pick it up.</p>
<h3>To Improve the Reputation of Domestic Cotton, Strict Crackdown on Adulteration is Needed</h3>
<p>People in the cotton industry in the city said that all cotton markets in China have the bad habit of adulterating and counterfeiting. As a result of the counterfeiting of domestic cotton, the moisture content can reach 35%, and the impurity content can reach 20%. The excessive amount of water and impurities is the highest in the world, which causes the fiber to deteriorate and rot, wastes transportation labor, causes many disputes, destroys trade ethics, and reduces trade reputation. The losses suffered by the country and manufacturers are difficult to calculate in numbers. The root cause of the counterfeiting is that vendors sell it to seek illegal profits. The methods for cracking down on counterfeiting can be divided into two aspects: temporary and fundamental. In terms of temporary measures, the government should restore the cotton inspection institutions in various places to handle the work of cracking down on adulteration and counterfeiting. It is forbidden for the water and impurity content to exceed the legal limit. At the same time, vendors who adulterate and counterfeit should be investigated and punished to crack down on their attempts to seek illegal profits. In terms of fundamental measures, efforts should be made to increase production, circulate finance, organize production and marketing cooperatives, implement centralized management of ginning and packaging, and implement fair inspection of cotton grading and water and impurity content.</p>
<h3>To Save the Entire Commercial Crisis, Relax Credit and Loan Restrictions; The City Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce recently submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan, stating that the government's revision of the Banking Law places extremely strict restrictions on credit loans, and requested that the above-mentioned regulations be relaxed to alleviate commercial difficulties. We are exploring its original presentation as follows: "The Banking Law promulgated but not implemented on March 28, 1931, has very strict restrictions on credit loans in Article 34, and merchants already felt many obstacles at that time. Now, we hear that the draft Banking Law being drafted by Your Yuan has stricter restrictions on credit loans than the old Banking Law. If implemented, the channels for merchants to use credit loans will be almost cut off, which is a major concern. The production loans of factories can be mortgaged with raw materials and machines, and international trade for import and export can use documentary bills. Commodities purchased in other ports or sold in other ports can use acceptance bills. However, the vast majority of stores that purchase goods locally and sell them in local stores, sell goods for cash, cannot store commodities in warehouses as collateral, nor can they use documentary bills and acceptance bill methods. Therefore, financial institutions can only use current account overdrafts as credit loans to accommodate funds. For example, pawnshops are lending institutions that accept pledges themselves, but due to the scattered nature of items, they cannot use the transfer and mortgage method to establish dealings with financial institutions. In addition, industries such as hotels, restaurants, and entertainment have no raw materials or commodities that can be mortgaged for loans, and they can only rely on credit loans. These are just examples, and there are many others. If credit loans are on the verge of being cut off, the above-mentioned commercial sectors can only borrow from private individuals to raise funds. I am sincerely afraid that the current trend of high-interest discounting will never be reformed, there is no hope of centralized funds, and there is no opportunity to suppress interest rates. This matter concerns the financial industry in detail, but it concerns all commercial sectors in general. Since this association has vaguely heard about it, in order to save the commercial crisis and relieve commercial suffering, it dares to report the facts truthfully, and earnestly prays that the regulations in the Banking Law being formulated will slightly relax the restrictions on credit loans so that commerce can have sufficient turnover, which is truly convenient for the public."</p>
<h3>Flour Factories Consult with the Four Joint Offices on Loans for Purchasing New Wheat; The Total Amount Required is Approximately 160 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize flour prices, the authorities specially stipulated in March that the price limit in this city applies to the Beijing-Shanghai line, and it has been implemented for a month. According to the person in charge of the 4th District Flour Industry Association, due to the different situations in various places, only Nanjing, Wuxi, and Shanghai are currently being uniformly distributed by the China Trust Bureau. In other ports, retail businesses have not applied to the China Trust Bureau due to cumbersome application procedures, delayed dates, and a shortage of funds, which is insufficient for turnover. Now that the bureau has not allocated it, the local price is controlled by market supply and demand. For this reason, the four major flour factories in the city have not been able to purchase wheat from producing areas in accordance with their expectations. The new wheat this year will be available on the market in mid-June at the earliest, although the date is far away, but to avoid repeating the same mistakes as when the new wheat was available on the market last year when various factories had no funds to purchase it, they are now informally consulting with the Four Joint Offices on loans. Assuming a production volume of 2 million dan, calculated at the current market price of 80,000 yuan per zu, the total amount would be 160 billion yuan. Although funds can be alleviated by increasing the turnover resolution, private manufacturers have limited capabilities, and it is highly hoped that the government will provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Daily Production of Yarn by Private Textile Industry is Over 80,000 Pieces; Cloth is 1.9 Million Bolts</h3>

<h3>The Chicken and Duck Industry is Preparing for Joint Operations; Methods of Implementation Have Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>The Chicken and Duck Business Association of this city once suggested to the municipal authorities to improve the chicken and duck business. As a result of consultations with relevant bureaus and associations this month, it is proposed to change this type of chicken and duck industry into a local public business in Shanghai in order to enrich the municipal treasury. The decided methods of implementation are as follows: (1) Funds will be raised by the promoters themselves, and the municipal bank will provide loans. (2) Business locations will be selected and established in districts according to actual sales needs. (3) Members will join the joint operation completely voluntarily. (4) The commission is tentatively set at 13%. If there are any changes, they need to be approved by the authorities. (5) The commission will be distributed into ten shares: 30% for expenses, 40% for profits, 1.5% for municipal construction subsidies, and 1.5% for social welfare undertakings. It has also been approved by the municipal government for the industry association to implement. If this measure is realized, it will be beneficial to public health, material management, and improvement of chicken and duck breeding.</p>

<h3>New Tides Surge, Ancient City Roars: A Rights Protection Movement in Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Airmail dispatch on March 21st, by our correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan</p>
<p>As spring deepens and the Jin River flows calmly, the peaceful society of Chengdu has been stirred by the rising national tide of rights protection and patriotism, igniting fervent patriotic sentiments in nearly a million citizens. The call for rights protection resounds throughout every corner of society, particularly within educational and cultural circles. This surge of impassioned patriotism marks the most significant expression of popular will in Chengdu in over a decade, a revival of the spirit of the May Fourth Movement. This instance of rights protection is widely recognized as a new May Fourth Movement.</p>
<p>Passionate Patriotic Sentiments for Rights Protection: The People of Sichuan Lead the Way</p>
<p>Throughout history, the people of Chengdu have often led the nation in their patriotic sentiments and national consciousness. The opening act of the Xinhai Revolution was the Railway Protection Movement in Chengdu. During the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, the people of Chengdu endured hardships, contributed their wealth and efforts, and wrote a page of glorious history of national victory and revival through eight years of struggle. The proposal by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to interfere in China's internal affairs is the greatest insult to the entire Chinese nation. China, as a victorious nation that contributed the most and sacrificed the most in the anti-aggression war, absolutely cannot tolerate any country using China's internal strife as an excuse to interfere in China's internal affairs. This is the consensus of the people of the nation. The people of Chengdu, as members of the nation, are unwilling to lag behind in patriotism. The theory of international interference, upon reaching Chengdu, ignited the righteous anger of millions of people.</p>
<p>The rights protection movement first broke out nationally in Chengdu. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly, representing seventy million people, roared, telegraphing Chairman Chiang and the National Government, demanding that they adhere to their position and lodging a serious protest with the Foreign Ministers Conference. Subsequently, the entire faculty of Chengdu University, Sichuan University, Huaxi University, Qilu University, Chenghua University, the National College of Science, and the three provincial vocational schools of arts, accounting, and physical education, including Xiao Gongquan, Wang Zhaorong, Zhang Linggao, and 187 others, jointly telegraphed the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to protest. A surge of anger swept across Sichuan. Successive telegrams of support were sent by approximately 148 county and city assemblies throughout Sichuan, the Chengdu Press Association and Journalists Association, the Sichuan-Kang National Assembly Representatives Association, the Sichuan Administrative Research Association, the Political and Economic Society, the Social Construction Society, academic research societies of universities and colleges, the Moral Promotion Society, and cultural organizations such as the China-America, China-Britain, China-Korea, China-France-Belgium-Switzerland Cultural Associations. In addition, social organizations such as the Wude Society, the Veterans Association, the Dazhong Society, the Minben Society, and the Datong Society, along with people's organizations such as farmers' associations, educational associations, labor unions, and chambers of commerce in Sichuan Province and its cities, totaling over 520 organizations, all called for justice and national dignity. This is the national voice and patriotic fervor of seventy million people in Sichuan, a solemn declaration to schemers and troublemakers: the Chinese people are not to be insulted.</p>
<p>Eight Thousand Students Form a Parade Line, Writing a Magnificent History of Youth Movement</p>
<p>As the vanguard of patriotism, the passionate sentiments of Chengdu's young students in this instance of rights protection are an unprecedentedly grand manifestation in Chengdu's student community in over a decade. The theory of interference in China, upon reaching Chengdu, ignited the students' patriotic anger. They immediately and swiftly organized the "Chengdu Municipal Schools Rights Protection Movement Joint Conference." From the 18th, all schools in the city went on strike for three days, and on the 18th, a National Rights Protection Conference was held. The conference included over 80,000 students from major and minor schools throughout the city, including Sichuan University, Huaxi University, Qilu University, and Chenghua University, totaling over 50 school units. This was an unprecedented grand gathering in Chengdu's student community.</p>
<p>The venue was Huaxi Dam in Chengdu's cultural district. Miss Li of Huaxi University was temporarily elected as the chair, and she passionately expressed the students' outrage at the Foreign Ministers Conference's unreasonable discussion of China's internal affairs. Subsequently, the deans of discipline of Sichuan University and Huaxi University encouraged the students to enrich the patriotic movement by studying national defense science in the laboratories. Renowned professor Liu Shichuan pointed out, from the perspective of international law, that international interference is an illegal act of infringing on rights. Finally, amidst thunderous applause, the conference passed a declaration and two telegrams addressed to the Foreign Ministers Conference and Chairman Chiang of the National Government, proclaiming: "China's internal affairs issues will be handled legitimately by the government itself. We will use action to safeguard the independence and freedom of national sovereignty. We firmly oppose scheming groups who are intent on selling out the motherland. Therefore, we roar to safeguard national sovereignty, oppose international interference, concentrate the strength of youth, and eradicate obstacles to unification."</p>
<p>After the conference, a parade was held. The magnificent procession of 80,000 people constituted a new Great Wall of the nation. The patriotic cries of 80,000 people resonated through the clouds. The route followed the prosperous areas of the city. Hundreds of thousands of onlookers on both sides were filled with anger and joined in the chorus, shouting slogans such as: "Youth of the nation, unite!" "Oppose parties who collude with foreign bandits to harm the nation!"... The passionate and慷慨的情緒 (kāng kǎi de qíng xù - generosity) was so moving that some onlookers were moved to tears. This supreme manifestation of youthful spirit is where the soul of the Chinese nation resides, and it is also a symbol of the glorious history of the Chinese nation created over thousands of years. After the 18th, major and minor schools and people from all walks of life spontaneously paraded for three consecutive days, telling the world that the Chinese nation will never be subjugated.</p>
<p>Youth are the backbone of the nation, the core of the race. The vibrancy of the spirit of the youth of the times represents the rise and fall, survival and demise of the nation. Looking back in history, there was the movement of the students of the Imperial Academy in the Northern Song Dynasty, followed by the Southern Song Dynasty's revival. The May Fourth Movement in the early Republic of China inspired the national revolutionary sentiments of the Northern Expedition. This time, the rights protection movement of Chengdu's educational circles and young students is a rebirth of the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and it is also a decisive new May Fourth Movement. In the future history of China's nation-building and revival, a splendid and glorious chapter of youth movement history will surely be written.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Annals</p>
<h3>The Early Life of Michelangelo</h3>
<p>— Xu Fan</p>
<p>When you see a marble sculpture, you will never again think of it as a lifeless piece of marble. What amazing skill it is! The person with this skill is called a sculptor. Michelangelo was an immortal sculptor.</p>
<p>He was born in Italy four hundred years ago. He had many siblings, all of whom were called upon to run the pawnshop, but he alone was sent to school, where his father hoped he would become a scholar.</p>
<p>But this child did not like his lessons. He abandoned his books and spent his time in the art studio. At home, he was always drawing, keeping many small scraps of sketches. He even tried to preserve sketches drawn on the walls with charcoal.</p>
<p>His father did not like this. He did not want his child to become an artist, because artists were often impoverished at that time. He punished his child for drawing. But this was useless; nothing interested Michelangelo except drawing.</p>
<p>Michelangelo lived in a school in Florence, where his parents lived in the city. At school, there was a child who loved drawing as much as Michelangelo. They became good friends. They ran around Florence, enjoying watching artists work.</p>
<p>This child's friend knew of a very famous artist in Florence. Michelangelo and his friend went to visit the artist's studio. Michelangelo wanted to study painting there for a long time, but he was afraid his father would not allow it.</p>
<p>Finally, Michelangelo's father agreed. One day, he discussed it with the artist, showing him his child's sketches. The artist exclaimed in delight, "I am willing to take him. Let your child come here to study painting!" Thus, the discussion was successful.</p>
<p>Now, there was a happy child in Florence. Michelangelo's mind was immersed in the excitement of studying painting. He devoted all his time to this initial work. He worked alongside other students for three years.</p>
<p>One day, Michelangelo was watching a student paint, copying a picture by the teacher. He felt that the teacher's picture was not well done, so he quickly sketched an outline to correct it. After copying it, the student returned it to the teacher, who saw the new lines added to the painting and asked, "Who changed this picture?" The child replied, "Michelangelo." "Yes," the teacher exclaimed, "I know no one else could have modified it like this!"</p>
<p>In those times, public places often had paintings on the walls. Michelangelo's teacher was painting a decoration on a church wall, and some of the best students climbed the ladders to help with the work. One day, the teacher was absent, and the students continued to work. Michelangelo made a drawing depicting the interior of the church and the young people and workers. When the teacher returned and saw the drawing, he was amazed by the compact composition. He exclaimed, "This child already knows more than I do!"</p>
<p>At the same time, a noble prince lived in Florence. His home was a palace surrounded by gardens. The palace and park were called St. Mark's. This prince loved beautiful sculptures. He had traveled all over the world to collect them, and many were placed in the St. Mark's gardens.</p>
<p>The prince was generous and willing to let others appreciate the sculptures. He wrote to all the painters in Florence, saying, "Choose two of your best students and bring them to the St. Mark's gardens. They can study sculpture here. A good teacher will be waiting for them!"</p>
<p>When Michelangelo's teacher received the letter, he read it to the students. Every student in the room wanted to go, but only two could go. They all thought Michelangelo would be chosen, as they knew he was the best student. Indeed, Michelangelo and his friend were taken to the palace to study.</p>
<p>In the St. Mark's gardens, Michelangelo first devoted all his time to painting. At that time, he saw a young man sculpting with clay and wanted to do the same. Therefore, Michelangelo tried clay modeling.</p>
<p>He often watched the stonemasons carve stones and marble, as they were building a large library. The young artist became friends with these stonemasons. He asked for some of their unused pieces of marble. From those few pieces of stone, he tried to carve figures, beginning his great career as a sculptor.</p>

<h3>A Brief Account of the Joint Exhibition at the Capital Art Festival</h3>
<p>— Qian Dongsheng</p>
<p>The Art Festival commemoration, held in Nanjing on March 25th, took place at the Central Cultural Auditorium in Xiangpu Camp, Guofu Road. At the same time, works by artists from various regions were exhibited, including Chinese paintings, oil paintings, watercolors, sketches, sculptures, designs, calligraphy, and photography, totaling over 300 pieces. The artists included Liu Haisu, Chen Shuren, Chen Zhifo, Xu Beihong, Fu Baoshi, Wang Yachen, Qin Xuanfu, Lü Sibai, Qi Baishi, Lü Fengzi, Pu Xinyu, Wu Zuoren, Zhu Rizhang, Li Ruinian, Yu Feng, Xue Zhen, and others, as well as two watercolor paintings by Mr. Zhang Daofan, which were the most eye-catching works at the event.</p>
<p>The exhibits were all carefully crafted masterpieces by artists from various regions. Haisu's "Four Banks Warehouse" was a huge oil painting with a composed and powerful composition and coloring, reminding people of the heroic sacrifice of the eight hundred warriors, with profound intention. Shuren's "Wisteria and Little Crow" used casual strokes, floating like the artist himself, with vibrant colors and lifelike resemblance. Zhifo's "Peach Blossom and Crow" used rich colors and was vividly lifelike. Beihong's "Galloping Horse" and Baoshi's "Landscape" had reached a realm of divine transformation. Their brushwork and ink usage were unprecedented and could be called the best. Yachen's "Goldfish" consisted of a few fish swimming up and down, seemingly in the water, with elegant and beautiful coloring and brushwork. Qin Xuanfu's oil paintings, with their bright and rich colors, depicted the vast and serene beauty of the Sichuan landscape with terraced fields and mountains. Lü Sibai's oil portraits and landscapes, with their color tones and brushstrokes, had reached a realm of truth, goodness, and beauty, and could be called masterpieces. Qi Baishi's "Pumpkins by an Eighty-Six-Year-Old Child" used deep indigo to dye the light yellow skin of the pumpkins, adding dark ink for the green leaves, resulting in an aged, vigorous, antique, and fragrant work. Lü Fengzi's "Arhats and Ladies" depicted the inner world of the characters, with iron-wire outlines and a unique style, ancient, vigorous, and undoubtedly unique. Pu Xinyu's landscapes were light, simple, and distant, with elegant coloring, giving a sense of detachment from the world. Wu Zuoren's oil portrait, depicting the female painter Yu Feng, used lively and vivid facial light tones and brushstrokes. Rizhang's watercolor landscapes used simple brushstrokes to depict the maritime scenery, smoke, clouds, and waves realistically. Li Ruinian's oil painting of withered trees by a lake used refined and masterful coloring. Other artists such as Yu Feng and Xue Zhen, with their watercolors, were all excellent artists in the art exhibition. There were so many outstanding works that it is impossible to describe them all. Famous artists gathered, leaving nothing out, concentrating the essence of the country, and exhibiting it in one room. It was truly the most complete art exhibition after the victory, adding a great deal of splendor to the annual Art Festival.</p>
<h3>A Stroll Through the Art Festival Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhu Bi</p>
<p>Recently, due to the sluggishness of industry and commerce and the difficulty of transportation, art exhibitions in Shanghai do not seem as prosperous as before. Joint exhibitions, in particular, are even harder to see. Seeing the news in the newspapers about the joint exhibition celebrating the Art Festival, with a large-scale exhibition at two venues and no admission fee, shows the enthusiasm of the promoters in promoting art, and also aroused my interest in visiting.</p>
<p>On the day of the Art Festival, I stepped onto the second floor of the National Goods Company. A large venue, connecting more than ten rooms, was arranged neatly and appropriately, in perfect order, giving me a sense of reverence. Upon entering, there were calligraphies by Ye Yuhu, Zhang Ji, Ma Gongyu, and others, as well as Wu Hufan's landscape masterpiece "High Altitude Strange Peak." Zhang Daqian's Dunhuang Grottoes copy, a huge Buddha image reaching a height of over ten feet, painted on cloth with powder color, was brilliant and vivid, as if we were seeing the original murals in person. Wang Yachen, who excels in fish paintings, presented a work that was particularly outstanding, showing that the beauty of an artist who understands nature is not limited to brush and ink. The fish paintings by Liu Shi and others were all works that imitated nature. Wang Jinshan's figure painting "Old Man Waving a Fan" showed great sketching skills. Among the Chinese paintings, there were works with pandas as the theme. The artists were unwilling to be limited by the themes of the ancients; they used their own immediate intuition as the starting point for creation, which is also commendable.</p>
<p>In the Western painting section: Liu Haisu's landscapes and flowers were all completed quickly with bold and unrestrained brushstrokes, with a majestic and vigorous spirit. Yan Wenliang's landscapes, with an extremely meticulous and careful approach, gave people a sense of the preciousness of rules and order. The largest painting in the oil painting section, "Scarred and Broken," was Zhang Chongren's latest creation. He depicted industry destroyed by war, and we must raise the spirit of construction. The enthusiasm of the colors, the magnificence of the brushstrokes, and the implicit composition that Zhang showed on the screen all revealed inner strength. The still life by female writer Zhou Ruying, with red dahlias casually scattered on a white table and a porcelain urn hidden behind, was able to express the nature of the objects and the contrast of colors appropriately. Harding's Yongcai used the charm of dry and wet, real and virtual in watercolor to the fullest. His "The Beginning of the Year" and Wang Hui's "Plan for the Year" both fully demonstrated the spirit of creation. In the midst of the troubled times, we can see the efforts of our young painters; they truly exist. Liu Xucang's "Flower" and "Summer" used delicate yet unrestrained colors and brushstrokes, while Ran Xi's watercolors used all wet washes, and Li Yongsen's watercolors all used dry wrinkles, both full of fun. Gu Tingkang was known for his precision, and Shen Yinying was known for his freedom, each showing their strengths. Other female writers such as Fang Junbi and Shen Yan also presented fine works. In short, the Western paintings in this exhibition were more numerous and of a higher standard than the exhibits at last year's Victory Exhibition.</p>
<p>In the sculpture section, Zhang Chongren's "Sculpture of Wu Hufan" was the most eye-catching for its vivid expression. Zhou Ruying's "The People Take Food as Heaven" had a novel theme and skillful technique. Xu Shiqi's "Portrait" was exquisite and lovely. Liu Kaiqu and Ge Yongliang also had masterpieces on display.</p>
<p>The second venue, the Xu Gengtang of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, was dedicated to photography. Perhaps due to its small size, the number of exhibits was not large, but they were all famous works; some had already been published in the World Photography Yearbook, such as Liu Xucang and Lang Jingshan's proud works. Other famous artists, such as Lin Hanlun, Lu Shifu, and Zhuang Xueben, also had masterpieces on display, providing a good opportunity for those who study photographic art to not miss.</p>
<p>Art is the crystallization of human wisdom and the expression of culture. The rise and fall of a nation and the degree of its evolution are all evidenced by art. However, those engaged in artistic work are often neglected by the material society, and therefore often live in poverty. In this modern era of difficult living, it is truly admirable to have so many beautiful masterpieces for us to appreciate. Although my mind was refreshed after seeing this exhibition, I could not help but feel infinite sympathy for the noble lives of artists.</p>
<h3>Integrated Art</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Du Jun Bingruben, who specializes in applied art, is proficient in patterns, decorations, and advertising paintings. He has made rapid progress and reached a state of perfection; moreover, his thoughts are so wonderful that they inspire awe.</p>
<p>Integrated art generally takes poetry as its main framework. The plot of the poem is divided into several sections, and each section is painted in a picture. The techniques used in the pictures are either Chinese or Western, ancient or modern, each different and with its own charm. Each picture also includes a section of the poem written in various fonts, resembling landscapes, bronze vessels, or steles, with the Cuan Baozi script being the most common. It combines metallurgy, stone carving, calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose into one, opening up a new path for art in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. The name "integrated art" is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The most intriguing works are the thirty-eight paintings and poems of "Song of Everlasting Regret," the ten paintings of "Incense Burner and Bell Rhythm," the nine paintings of "Stabbing the Tiger," the sixteen paintings of "Mulan Joins the Army," the eight paintings of "Palindrome Poems," the seven paintings of "Red Bean Poems," the four paintings of "Full Moon and Blooming Flowers," and the one large painting of "Song of Righteousness." They can be read as poetry and prose, as rubbings from stone inscriptions, as Chinese paintings, as Western paintings, or as patterns. There are many painters in Shanghai, but none have ever done this before. It is truly a unique and innovative work of art. Now, Du Jun will publicly exhibit dozens of his masterpieces in the Ningbo Fellow Association Hall. Those who want to understand the face of integrated art and broaden their horizons must see them as soon as possible. Calligraphy belongs to art and requires a talent for art, as well as years of effort, immersing oneself in it, in order to achieve mastery through self-denial and training.</p>
<h3>Lu Shixiong's Calligraphy</h3>
<p>— Zhizhi</p>
<p>Calligraphy belongs to art and requires a talent for art, as well as years of effort, immersing oneself in it, in order to achieve mastery through self-denial and training.</p>
<p>My friend Lu Shixiong comes from Jinshan, Jiangsu. His ancestors opened a bookstore there, so he has been sitting in the bookstore since he was a child. He has a natural love for art, and he often browses various steles and inscriptions. He always prepares ink and writes couplets for others, so Lu has many opportunities to practice calligraphy.</p>
<p>Today's young people often have a bias against Chinese and Western literature, excelling in one but lacking in the other. Because of his family background and his education at a church university, he is proficient in both Chinese and English. He has also been working in the insurance industry for a long time, so he has written many books and publications on insurance. Cai Yuanpei, the former president of the Academia Sinica, and Song Hanzhang, the general manager of the Bank of China, both praised Lu's writings.</p>
<p>Lu is taciturn, rarely smiling, decisive, bold but meticulous, sincere and responsible. General Wu Peifu personally wrote "Mountains and rocks do not flow, the sun and moon are naturally high and bright" to describe his character and calligraphy, which can be said to be perfectly suited to his identity.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 208</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, he let go, and something about the size of a mothball hit the chest of the young man in the car with a thud, rolling down his clothes. The men and women in the car were startled and looked out of the car, only to see the ragged boy had already retreated a few yards away, still showing his full set of white teeth, smiling, and giving a salute, before turning around and leaving.</p>
<p>"What is this thing?" the woman asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Probably no malice," the man seemed very calm. After the attendant put away the suitcase and busied himself getting in the car and starting the engine, as the car was already moving, the young man picked up the object; it turned out to be a small paper ball. Unfolding the paper ball, he saw four very vigorous Chinese characters written on it, with a number attached:</p>
<p>"Cathay Hotel...0915."</p>
<p>"Is it a Chinese secret agent?" the woman whispered.</p>
<p>"Maybe," the man seemed too busy smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Are you tired?"</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I be tired?...Ever since 10:50 last night, three hours in a car, followed by more than four hours of flying, the engine has been running non-stop, and then an hour in a speedboat, so noisy that I couldn't close my eyes."</p>
<p>"I think we women have more endurance, don't you think?" the woman said, taking the piece of paper from the man's hand, looking at it again and again; then, holding it up to the light of the car window, she shined the paper again and again, as if she wanted to study the secret of the paper.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, they were already settled in the Banzai Hotel.</p>
<p>"What's on the program, Brother?"</p>
<p>"You haven't announced your program to me...As for my personal program; first, a bath, second, breakfast, third, sleep."</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers Petition and Resort to Violence</h3>
<p>— Xuan Shi</p>
<p>Unemployment is a bitter thing, and it is an even bitterer thing to be unemployed when prices are high. After suffering the torment of unemployment for a long time, one's mood is bound to be bad, and therefore, when interacting with others, one is likely to resort to fighting with fists as long as there is a slight dispute. If these disputes touch one's emotions, they will erupt at the slightest touch, and one's reason will be unable to restrain them.</p>
<p>A few days ago, more than two hundred unemployed workers in a certain industry went to the industry association to petition. It is not known why, but in the middle of the discussion, a verbal conflict suddenly occurred, and the unemployed workers became angry and resorted to violence. In terms of reason, they belong to the same industry and have the same identity. When someone is unemployed, they should be harmonious and work together to find ways to help. However, at this time, although they belong to the same industry, there is a chasm between those who have jobs and those who do not, which separates them. Those who have jobs may not be able to provide much help due to the reality, while those who do not have jobs feel that the other party lacks sympathy and are inevitably unhappy seeing themselves starving. Because of this unhappiness, as long as there is a disagreement, a conflict will erupt. Outsiders think they have a bad temper, but in fact, it is because their mood is too bad. Once there is a fuse, it will explode immediately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the majority of those who have jobs are not in a good mood either. They are not full, but they are not starving to death, and they harbor a bellyful of resentment all day and night. Given the opportunity, they will also make a big fuss to vent their hatred. Some time ago, someone reported that there were more than a million unemployed people in Shanghai, struggling to survive on the starvation line. In fact, those who have jobs are also struggling. For the past hundred years, we have been struggling in poverty, but in recent years, after a long period of war, life has become more difficult, and therefore, the situation of struggle has become more tragic. The more tragic it is, the stronger the fire in our hearts.</p>
<p>We often hear moralists say, "People's hearts have changed greatly!" In fact, people's hearts have not changed; they have only added a ball of fire. This ball of fire was once used in the War of Resistance, allowing us to persevere to the end and defeat the tyranny. How should we use this ball of fire now? If used well, it can emit a great light; if used poorly, it will forever be a ball of resentment.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Youth Day</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>Some say that Chinese youth are lucky because they have the opportunity to see this magnificent era; but at the same time, some say that we are unfortunate to be Chinese youth, having experienced hardships and tasted bitterness. Neither this optimistic nor pessimistic view sees the fortune or misfortune of Chinese youth: those who face a great era but have not infused it with a drop of their own blood and sweat are merely spectators in front of a stage, passersby in life; those who have suffered and endured hardships, if it is to bear the pain of this era, should have no complaints and be happy!</p>
<p>The hot blood of youth must flow through the pulse of the times. We have nothing to do with luck or misfortune; we should only have joy and greater joy.</p>
<p>Life cannot be said to be without depression, and the depression of youth is naturally greater: economic, political, romantic, and domestic… but depression is not physiological, but pathological. Understanding this, he should heal himself and also heal those who suffer from the same disease. Do not lose the will to live first; depression is merely a process of transformation, and the joy of rebirth is expected.</p>
<p>Depression is a symbol of all construction: art is like this, and life is like this.</p>
<p>The previous generation told us: "You are young people, you should do this and that": they see themselves as dead souls! But we must never again advise the next generation in the same way: "We are about to get old, all hope is on you": separating ourselves from reality, shirking responsibility, and hoping for others, this kind of youth is the most useless.</p>
<p>Youth and non-youth are not divided by time, but by the soundness of mental strength.</p>
<p>"March 29" is designated as "Youth Day," intending to remind people to cherish the memory of the martyrs and invigorate the spirit of the yellow flowers and green blood. The previous generation of youth shed blood to save the motherland, and this generation of youth sweats to build the motherland. With blood and sweat intermingling, we can complete the magnificent building.</p>
<p>Young people should not weep or retaliate against hatred, nor should they become narrow-minded and violate their nature and aspirations because of hatred. Tolerance, solemnity, purity, and perseverance are the qualities that Chinese youth must possess. (Written two days before the Youth Day of the 36th year)</p>
<h3>Rouge Lips</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Imported Lipstick</p>
<p>Like Cupid's bow, lipstick skillfully dyes for charm! Worshiping foreign psychology: "Foreign lipsticks are beautiful"!</p>
<p>Alarms smuggling much, national goods have no business; cherry mouth, wiping workers' tears, swallowing up the factory!</p>
<p>Note: Lip makeup is called the "Cupid's Bow Style," see the New York makeup expert's interview in this newspaper a few months ago. In fact, it is what we call the "菱角式" (diamond-shaped style).</p>
<h3>Monks and Nuns Living Together</h3>
<p>— Lu Chen</p>
<p>Monks and nuns in Hangzhou openly live together. Zhejiang Chairman Shen Honglie, indignant at this corruption of customs, exclaimed "Psychological Construction" and intends to "strictly rectify" it. In fact, I think it is "completely unnecessary," because monks are men, and nuns are women, "Yin and Yang harmony is inherently a beautiful thing." To improve customs, there are many things that need "psychological construction" in the whole country, in one province. "Monks" and "nuns" "openly living together," to put it bluntly, is "just a small matter."</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai was actually spared from death, which shows the country's utmost intention to cherish talent. "As far as I know," the central government has always been generous to him in the past, but it could not enable him to "compete with the wealth and position of Kong and Song," so he "turned to Wang." What Zhou Fohai wanted was to "compete with the wealth and position of Kong and Song." After "following Wang," his "wealth and position" reached its "peak." Now, as a man awaiting death, he has actually been spared. Chen and Chu, if they knew, would appear "inferior" in comparison. As they say in Shanghai: "This is Zhou Fohai's trick." Who says it's not true?</p>
<h3>Record of Yang Shixiang</h3>
<p>— A Chrysanthemum Lover</p>
<p>The Governor-General of Zhili was the leader of the governors-general and governors of all provinces. Therefore, after the pacification of the Cantonese bandits, Zeng Wenzheng and Li Wenzhong were both seated as prime ministers with noble titles. After the Jiawu War, it was Wang Wenshao. The most昏憤 one was Yu Yan during the Gengzi era. Renhe entered the Grand Council and Ronglu succeeded him. Yu then succeeded Rong, catering to Empress Dowager Cixi and worshiping the Boxers. His misdeeds that harmed the country and the people were the lowest of the low even among the Manchus. Among the Han Chinese governors-general of Zhili, there were two who considered themselves outstanding: one was Yang Shixiang. Lianfu was the son of a famous father and started his career in the Hanlin Academy. He changed his official position to the Daotai of Zhili. During the Gengzi year, he also made some contributions in the siege of Tianjin. When foreign soldiers entered Tianjin, he even suffered serious injuries. Compared with those who now avoid the rear and speak of resistance, it seems that he was still a better option. During the peace talks, he participated in the staff of the Prime Minister of Hefei, and surprisingly became a judicial commissioner and then a governor, suddenly ascending to high positions. His elder brother, Yang Dalang Shixie (Weichun), was a vice minister of the Ministry of Works. Weichun and Lianfu were classmates in the Renwu and Yiyou imperial examinations respectively, so I knew them very well. His political achievements are set aside for the moment, but there are many anecdotes about him that can be told. He was famous for being henpecked throughout his life. As soon as he heard his wife's shrewish roar, he was like Fang Shanzi (Chen Cao, who prostrated himself in the dressing pool), his cane falling to the ground, his heart bewildered. He was genuinely fond of Peking Opera. Except for official business, whether walking, chanting, sitting, or lying down, he would hum. What he hummed was either the "anti-tune" or the "slow board." Therefore, on the day of his death, he sang a high-pitched song and then passed away peacefully. A certain famous scholar jokingly wrote an elegy for him, saying: "Throughout his life, he loved to practice with strings and pipes, and until his death, he never smelled the fragrance of beautiful women." This was because his wife was extremely jealous, and he never had concubines or servants throughout his life, hence the saying. It was widely circulated at the time as a topic of conversation.</p>
<p>The Yang brothers were all talented. Lianfu was Yang the Fourth Brother. In addition to Yang the Fifth Brother Xingcheng, and Qian Qiancheng, who were Xu Shichang's "Hem and Haw Generals," Yang the Third Brother Shichen was also a Jinshi of the Ren Chen year. The Eighth Brother Zhiqing and I took the autumn examination together four times. Because of the official papers, we often had the same examination number. His talent was also very rich and comprehensive, but it was a pity that he did not get the opportunity.</p>
<p>Lianfu's writing style was very appropriate, and his poetry and prose were famous for sale. The Eighth Brother had a love for a singing girl named Suyun. His elder brother wrote a couplet of Du Fu's poems for her, saying: "Deep in the heart, entrust heroic simplicity; Stirring the chest, rise layered clouds." Later, he fell in love with another woman named Hongyu. His elder brother also wrote a couplet for her: "There are plenty of red gorge butterflies surrounding spring; No one recognizes the jade toad." Suyun and Hongyu, both names are extremely familiar and common, but the two couplets are not only well-structured, but also have beautiful diction. They were able to present them in a complete and natural manner, which is truly the work of a talented person. All of this was told to me by the Eighth Brother, so I have included it here.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Two very big ears, big ears!" Rong'er, who was crying, suddenly wiped away her tears with the back of her hand and turned around to tell them. He heard A Shi vividly describing his "Bunny Daddy," and his heart was so happy that he temporarily forgot everything in front of him.</p>
<p>"Really! Really! Two big ears, shiny and smooth big ears!" A Shi, who was in his twenties, still had some innocence. "That pair of eyes is also very energetic, making people love it!..."</p>
<p>Although he spoke with enthusiasm, his master understood that it was neither made of gold nor inlaid with any diamonds, so he was no longer interested.</p>
<p>"Stop talking! Be careful with that box!" He interrupted A Shi as if scolding him.</p>
<p>Xiao Shen, however, was unwilling to miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>"Little brother, don't worry, I'll buy you another one tomorrow!" He said to Rong'er, who was staring blankly at Xu the Fat, with a gentle voice that humans rarely possess.</p>
<p>"You can't buy one!" Rong'er replied with a pout.</p>
<p>Outside, there was another violent explosion, and Lan tightly gripped her cold, sweaty hands.</p>
<p>"I'll have one custom-made for you!" Xiao Shen was determined to make this five-year-old child happy. "If we can't have it custom-made here, we'll go to Chongqing to have it custom-made, or to Kunming! If we can't have it custom-made in China, we'll go to America!"</p>
<p>He thought that this would definitely make the child happy.</p>
<p>"You haven't even seen Bunny Daddy, how would you know what he looks like!" Unexpectedly, Xiao Rong said a few words that were even more fierce than an adult's.</p>
<p>This made Xiao Shen feel a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Hahaha!" Shen the Fat laughed gleefully. Lan, who had been trying to maintain her composure, had been waiting for so long without seeing 　　 and Zhu Zhaonian's shadows. Her nerves had been so tense that they were numb. She didn't hear Xiao Shen and Rong'er's reply, so she didn't express anything, making Xiao Shen feel that it was really difficult to step down.</p>
<p>There were more explosions and machine gun fire.</p>
<p>"Today, the Japanese devils are deliberately here to 　　　, dropping so many bombs and not running away," 　　　 several people hiding from the air raid said, finally managing to 　　 relieve Xiao Shen's embarrassment.</p>
<p>"It's because our air force has retreated to 　Zhou," Xiao Shen immediately seized this opportunity and started to 　 with them, temporarily having to give up attacking 　. (29)</p>
