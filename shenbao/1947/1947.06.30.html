<h3>吉長鐵路全線打通　四平方面卽可會師　遼西共軍受挫轉犯北票</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春廿九日電〕被共軍遮斷多日之吉長路，廿九日全綫打通，盤踞該路東段樺皮廠及河灣子兩地共軍，已於本日分別被由吉林及九台兩地出擊之國軍先後擊潰，東西兩路國軍，即於當日午後在河灣子車站附近正式會師。按吉長路係於本月十五日被濂斷者，現交通當局已會同軍方開始搶修沿路被毁路軌·橋樑·電話桿綫及小豐滿輸電綫路，吉長交通不久可望恢復。</p>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿九日電〕南路國軍廿九日午後克復四平南一站虻牛哨，估計卅日晨即可與四平守軍會師。北路國軍渡東遼河後，已克郭家店，續向前進。該處爲共軍迎擊北來國軍較强據點，國軍突破此點後，即可完成夾擊四平任務。四平兩軍東西對峙，廿四小時來，仍不斷接觸，態勢無大變化，惟急待解圍。</p>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿九日電〕四平下午五時電話，竟日戰事沉寂，全城軍民踴躍修築工事，於下午二時半休息之際，突自城南方面傳釆一陣砲聲，繼而砲聲愈小，稍頃，司令部證實該砲聲係南來援軍所發，全城軍民聞訊，歡喜若狂。</p>
<p>〔中央社潘陽廿九日電〕昌團電話，國軍現分十六路，乘上茲月色，連夜向四平挺進，卅日拂曉當可會師。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿九日電〕岑寂廿四小時之四平戰事，昨夜又吿緊張，共軍自九時起，以濃密砲火向守革陣地發射，澈夜砲聲隆隆，並以步兵衝鋒，爲守軍擊退，衆信此乃共軍潰敗前之迴光反照。又共軍向四平以南之綫反撲，猛烈抗拒北上國軍，刻在雙廟子桓溝子之綫激戰中。一度進至四平西南之國軍先頭都隊，西向八面城以南轉進。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽蕙九日電〕遼西共軍圍攻朝陽不下，又趨兵東指北票，其兵力約萬餘，現已將綿承綫通北票啣接點金嶺寺侵據，開始圍攻北票。按北票有一大發電廠，供給阜新煤礦並義縣錦西電力，阜新日產煤五千噸，現存待運煤十一萬噸，北票則煤產量較少。</p>
<p>〔中央社承德廿九日電〕共軍自朝陽受挫敗退後，廿八日復　集部隊侵犯北票，當與該地守軍展開劇烈之戰鬥，金嶺寺至義縣間之鐵橋，全部遭破壞，鐵路亦多被拆毁，國軍已自錦縣，朝陽兩路出動，急往應援。又進犯平泉之共軍，廿八日已被守軍全部擊退，殘部分自原路狼狽潰竄。</p>
<h3>美撤銷對華軍火禁令　有重大政治意義　杜魯門主義開始適用於中國</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京廿九日電〕國民政府某高級官員今日單獨接見本社記者，認美國之准許中國向美購買軍用品，等於將社魯門主義適用於中國，實具有重大之政治意義。其言有云：「迄至目前爲止，美國對中國之援助，係屬以善後復興爲主之經濟性援助，武器禁運令之撤銷，係　於前此所嘗避免之政治上的理出而採取之行動，堪被視爲杜魯門主義之開始適用於中國，亦爲世界向勢轉變以後，去年馬歇爾調處國共爭端時所採之停止以武器援華之政策已有轉變之表示。査亞洲對於世界和平之成脅，遠在歐洲以上，故美國外交政策之增加對亞洲之注意至爲正當。美國此一新政策，緊接若干政府領袖如孫科等指責蘇聯援助中共之後，故並非以此等談話爲根據，而係於長期密切觀察中國之政治軍事局勢後，始決定變更社魯門總統於一九四五年宣布之對華政策。軍火　運令之撤銷，可以　補一般中國人民於聞悉五億元貸款將撤銷保留後所發生之失望情緒。一般中國民衆對於借款發展。並未予以密切注意，而對於此一問題，亦不暇予以詳細分析，因此遂認五億元借款保留期限之不予延長，爲對於中國道義上之打擊。其實就余所知，中國並未向美國聲請政治借款」。</p>
<p>首都一般人士皆認爲准許中國向美購買軍用品，較以來復槍子彈一千三百萬發售與中國更具遠大之重要性，同時據國防部某有資望之官員吿本社構，此一千三百萬發子彈，對於中國之內戰，並無決定性之影響，根據渠個人之估計，此等彈藥約可維持三個月，但總之究較根本沒有爲佳。就政府觀點言，此舉可以激發前綫之士氣，蓋彼等尤其是東北之軍隊，固已感覺彈藥之缺乏也。</p>
<p>此間政治觀察家預料，華盛頓此項宣示，將影響國民政府之對共黨下討伐令。此一問題可能將於明日討論，中政中常聯席會議明日開會時，或將討論及此。</p>
<h3>美對華政策轉變</h3>
<p>共和黨報紙已有預測</p>
<p>〔中央社舊金山廿九日電〕俄克蘭之共和黨報紙「論壇報」，於六月廿六日預測，由於目前之中國局勢以及共產軍重振所引起之惡化危機，美國諒將於最近之將來，轉變其對董政策。該報社論題名爲「中國之危機」。該社論係在國務院發表出售軍火聲明及進出口銀行董事長馬丁發表貸款聲明前刊出者，全文如下：中國之悲劇，將近最髙潮，對中國要求援助之呼聲，已日形緊迫。中國政府已由副主席孫科公開抨帶蘇聯協助中共之推進。不論南京政府之控訴爲何，事實似可證明，蘇聯對中國之抗議，已採取新政策。吾人之假定如下：即蘇聯已將東北自日人之物資移交與中共，半官方中國人士甚至逐條說明供給中共之飛機，坦克及裝甲車。同時在一九四五中蘇條約中雖規定中國對旅大之權利，然蘇聯今已拒絕中國政府接收旅大之合法權利。此種拒絕之理由，可能即因此二港口正被利用接濟中共之戰爭物資者。七月一日進出口銀行之五億對華貸款將吿期滿，馬歇爾已在華鹽頓表示將聽任期限消逝而不擬採取任何行動。此外，並未表示以後將無其他行動。由於中國之最近局勢及中共軍事復振所造成之惡化危機，吾人可預料美國之政策將有轉變。此種轉變，可望在最近之將來實現。</p>
<h3>今後美對華貸款將用以整頓幣制</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕經濟方面某權威人士，在五億美元貸款限期屆滿前夕語記者稱，未來美對華之貸款，將以以次數原則爲依據：最要者爲藉以穩定金融所作之整頓幣制，在此原則之下，如具有合理之計劃書，美當可予以貸款，其次爲發展民營企業及國營工業兩原則，民營廠商獲得貸款後自當向美購買原料，國營工業如獲發達，則中美貿易亦可隨之發展，基於以上之途徑，美決可續對華貸款。</p>
<h3>蒙藏僑務兩委會　組織法業經修正</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕蒙藏委會組織法及僑務委會組織法，業經立法院第三二九次會議修正通過。茲誌於後：修正蒙藏委會組織法之條文第三條，蒙職委會設委員長一人，副委員長二人，委員廿七人至卅五人。第四條蒙藏委會每月舉行會議一次，必要時得召集臨時會議。前項會議以委員長篇主席，委員長因事故不能執行職務時，指定副委員長一人代理之。第十三條，業藏委會秘書四人至六人，分黨機要文稿，會議紀綫及長官交辦事項。第十八條，蒙藏委會於必要時得呈准行政院於蒙藏或其他適當地方設辦事處，每處置處長一人，簡任，副處長一人，簡派。其組織規程由行政院定之。第廿一條，蒙藏委會於必要時聘用顧問七人至九人，專門委員八人至十二人</p>

<h3>保定情勢轉緩和　國軍向南推進定興解圍</h3>
<p>〔本報保定廿九日電〕保定近郊戰昨晚稍緩和，各綫共軍猛攻達四晝夜，傷亡頗重，廿九日晨戰地後移，情勢趨好轉，國軍刻正準備反擊中。又共軍一團昨晚十一時猛攻保城西奇村，刻已被整復退。又平保路破壞慘重，，修復需時，軍方準備路通後先駛汽車。</p>
<p>〔本報保定廿九日電〕據悉：魯北共軍運日調集冀省，津浦北段，石門國軍昨向東南進擊，共軍兩團彼殲，傷亡大半。</p>
<p>〔本報保定廿九日電〕官方稱：沿平漢綫南進國軍有力兵團，昨午已解定興園，廿九日晨先頭部隊越北河店，刻徐水，漕河間一部共軍西移。又共軍此次侵犯平漢北段，迄今傷亡近萬，其攻努已成强弩之末。另息：易縣，滿城係國軍自動撤守，容城，新城在固守中</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿九日電〕平漢北段戰事仍烈，國軍已開始由保定北上，向徐水，漕河前進，琢縣以東發現之共軍，經國軍予以迎擊，現已向東潰竄。軍方認爲，平保段共軍行動，並不能輕减津浦綫國軍對共軍之威脅，同時，國軍有力部隊正陸績沿平保綫南下，與由保北上國軍遙相呼應，形成夾擊之勢，已失陷各據點，必可收復。</p>
<p>〔中央社保定廿九日電〕軍息：容城共軍會以兩個旅兵力日夜猛烈圍攻，國軍沉着應戰，共軍迄禾得逞，傷亡慘重，刻城垣仍在國軍固守中，前傳國軍撤退與情形不明說，完全不確。</p>

<p>吳稚暉　氏略謂：毛澤東朱德擁兵倡亂，觸犯刑章，法院下令緝辦，乃其職責所在。至政府如下討伐令，亦屬尋常。蓋對弄兵危書國家之人，不得已而討伐，為政府之義務，並非如一般人所稱之內戰，更非黨派之爭。假使共黨只是一個政黨，為何要弄兵？前些年蘇聯史太林元帥，與托洛斯　且為同黨，史氏為保衛國家，尙毅然翦除托黨，絕不避內閧之嫌，可見保衛國家，行不得已之舉，乃政府之天職，無所用其驚怪。</p>
<p>通緝內亂外患犯為法治國家常事</p>
<p>李石曾斥毛澤東叛國</p>
<p>李石曾　氏略謂：中共年來行徑，殘民以逞，倒行逆施，已非普通政黨，而實與中國歷史上之流寇無異，就其勾結外力而言，更屬叛國。國人必須反對此類反動，政府即下令討伐，亦題中應有之義。所當注意者，吾人應嚴守三民主義之立塲，以民主自由之政治，團結全力，以平定共黨匪徒之亂事，但不可走入歧途，採取另一極權之方式。蓋打倒極權政治者，惟有民主政治之力量耳。至法院通緝內亂外患犯，在法治國家原為常事。國人共棄之徒，自為法律所不容也。</p>
<p>對最高法院措置陶百川三點意見</p>
<p>陶百川　（上海市參議員）稱：關於最高法院通緝毛澤東一事，我以為有三點可以注意：　　　第一：對於國共問題，國共雙方都曾主張政治解決，但自延安拒絕張治中去談判和平後，共黨已將政治解決之門斷然關閉，但國府則仍不斷宣稱隨時準備和平談判，不因共黨態度之惡化而變更初衷，此次通緝毛澤東，是否認為和平談判政治解決已無可能，是否即將發布討伐共黨之命令，變方之軍事行動是否將益趨積極，而其原因是否認為共黨問題已非單純之內亂而已變質為外患，此點殊可注意。　　第二，中央方面早有人認為，對共黨之軍事行動係全面戰爭，此謂作戰不應限於前方，不應限於軍事，而必須動員後方之力量，即政治·經濟·文化各方面之力量，方克有濟。此次通緝毛澤東，其意義是否等於討伐共黨，而政治·經濟·文化谷方面是否將施行一種戰時體制，以配合軍事，亦為一大問題。　　　第三，自民國廿六年修正危害民國緊急治罪法後，共黨在法律上不復被認為犯罪團體，參加共黨亦不成為犯罪行為，今共黨首領毛澤東在被通緝，則依政治的法律的解釋，共黨之地位是否亦有變更，共黨黨員是否成為犯罪之主體，國府不久或有明確之表示。</p>
<p>政策應從速行憲任何人不能違法</p>
<p>馬君碩　律師對此問題表示意見稱：政府為國家人民着想，應從迅實施憲政，但必須先厲行法治，所謂厲行法治者，即指全國上下均應在法律軌道內行事，凡超出法律上規定儸人，地域及黨派之範圍者，均不合法。任何黨派，其個人不得以武力作為政治競爭之工具，總之，在國內，任何人應尊重法紀，使國家達到和平統一，在國際上亦當充實國防，以維持五強之一之地位。</p>
<p>時局演變至今日　內容已愈趨複雜</p>
<p>吳蘊初　（工業協業理事長）表示。此舉對於實際局勢，影響不大，因雙方久已在交戰狀態中。但在另一方面，則此舉表示和解之途徑已絕，政府或將進一步下令討伐。時局演進至今日，因有國際因素存在，局面已愈趨複雜。　　　〔本報南京廿九日電〕記者頃訪民社黨蔣勻田，就最高法院檢察署通令全國各高等法院首席檢察官，嚴緝毛澤東一事，請表示意見。蔣稱：此或即係代替對共黨之討伐令。</p>

<h3>共軍瓷意摧殘破壞　東北工礦損失　資源委會發言人痛陳近況</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕遜來東北戰局日趨緊張，重工業廠礦尤爲共軍蓄意破壞之對象，載至目前止，巳陷米陷之廠礦，其一般情况如何，政府對整個東北工礦事業之應變措施如何，實爲國人所關切，昨經就此諸端訪問資委會發言，據談：東北工礦事業，雖遭一再破壞，經資委會一年來積極繁頓，艱苦支揮，本已略規模，此次共軍到處竄擾，各廠礦首蒙其害，殊堪痛心，目下應付善後，亦大爲棘手。就東北主要工礦事業電力，鋼鐵，及煤礦三者而言，電力方面，自小豐滿綫路被毀多數廠礦因無電力供應，機器無法轉動，但生產雖停，收入雖减，開支仍不能减少，不惟停工各廠礦員工須加維持，即小豐滿本身，其長工生活亦須繼續維持，鋼鐵方面，鞍山銷　公司，一度因海城吃緊，頻於危急，生產大受影響，該公司運往營口之鐲鐵五千噸，初乃東北經委會緩發出口許可證而躭誤，復因營口局勢混亂，故至今無法運出，損失至鉅。煤礦方面，遭受摧殘尤爲慘重，目前已被共軍攻陷者，如遼北之西安煤礦，其存煤器材及糧食等，均無一體免，員工臨時倉卒逃出者，尙須設法安置，予以救濟，曾一度彼攻陷現經收復者，如遼寗本溪煤鐵礦。熱河之北票煤礦，及吉林之營城煤礦等，　塲所有設備，多被共軍破壞，器材糧食則被搬走，收復後固應迅謀復工，但器材蕩然無存，設備殘缺不全，一時無力予以補充，至臨近戰區前綫者，如撫順烟台等礦，雖未渝陷，工人多被征協助駐軍構築防禦工事，市要礦用器材亦被徵用殆盡，生產工作，己瀕停頓，縱能保全，欲圖繼續生產，亦需另行大量投資。總之，無論已陷未陷各廠礦，政府對於辦理義後，撫輯流亡，補充設備，蒙劃復工，及維持員工生活等項，勢非籌撥相當款項不可，資委會鑒於茲事體大，已呈請政院核示矣。至目前應措措施，則本會已令飭東北各單位，嚴守崗位，非至最後，決不輕易　離，同時並須盡量設法保全廠礦器材。</p>
<h3>亞東協會昨成立　彭學沛說明組織經過及任務選出理監事曁呼委會負責人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕亞東協會成立大會，於昨晨儿時五十分在本市溧陽路（狄思威路）一一七七號內舉行。出席者有賀耀組，彭學沛，雷震，方治，徐寄廎，邵毓麟。徐逸樵等七十餘人，社會局副（局長李劍華奉部命列席指導。</p>
<p>臨時主席致詞　由彭學沛担任臨時主席，即席致辭稱：亞東協一會目前之組成分子，爲前中宣部之亞東問題研究會，及湯恩伯將軍領導之改造社。前者在抗戰時期，致力於對敵宣傅，不無貢獻；勝利後，任務性質一變，中央認歸聯絡各民族間情感之工作，應由民間團體担任，故決定改組，而改造社亦願意合作，遂有亞東協會之組織。我國與亞東各民族，先後有十世紀左右之關係，今各國均有光輝之成就，即新國如印尼共和國，在泛亞會議中，亦可見其人才之濟濟。我國對此等鄰邦，必須有了解與聯絡。而着手之方，則爲協助在華之亞東人士，以增進民族間之友誼，並作深入之調查研究工作。日本間題之研究最爲重要，以現狀言，日本必然復興，亞東協會應研究我國對日之正確政策，以供政府採納，並對其實施加以監督。彭氏最後强調兩點：（一）亞東協會無侵略性，並不要求中國領導亞東各國，如過去日本之研究團體所爲者；（二）協會無排他性，主張國際合作，而不主張「亞洲人之亞洲」。</p>
<p>修正通過會章　繼由籌務委員賀耀組報告兩個月來之籌備經過。並表示協會將致力於日本間題之解決，促使日本人民覺悟，不再作帝國主義之迷夢。</p>
<p>賀氏報告畢，主席則請李劍葉氏致辭指導。李氏指出中央對該會工作之車視，並贊揚協會追求之理想爲國際合作，有異於日本之大亞細亞主義，並祝協會成功。繼由來賓市黨部主委方治，市政府代表王兆榮相繼演說。　後主席特邀自京趕來開曹之雷震演說，略謂：協會應將中國之儒敎文化發揚於亞東諸國，　儒敎文化之優點爲其和平性，可消滅國際間之戰禍。對於　本之東山再起，雷氏深表警惕，謂希望以後中日兩國不再爲敵，只須日人放棄侵略觀念，我人應充分認識日本之長處，取得其人才及物資之援助。雷氏詞畢，即討論會章，當修正通過章程草案，計僅改動兩點：協會工作中，增加「交換留學生及敎授」（一）項；（二）在亞東各國，重要都市設分會而不設辦事處。尋即舉行選舉，產生理監事，午後召開理監事會議，推定各部份負責人。茲將理監事等名單誌後：</p>

<h3>台省參議會通過　隨賦收購糧食安　呈請中央提前實施縣市長民選</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿九日電〕台省參議會經過兩日激烈辯論後，終獲多數通過台灣有府送議之「隨賦收購糧食及收購大戶餘糧辦法」案。台省原爲產米地區，昨今兩年之米荒，全由糧商囤戶造成。魏道明主席認爲欲求安定社會，須由政府控制大量食糧，倘遇糧價上漲，立即辦理平糶。依照先由省府例會通過現又復經參議曾通過之收購糧食辦法，其中隨賦收購糧食部份，規定按照稻田正稅（即本稅）每元附購稻谷十二公斤，收購大戶餘糧部分則規定繳納田賦征寬稻谷在一千公斤以上者，就其餘糧按累進率收購，少者四成，多者六成，而繳納田賦征實稻谷在一千公斤以下者，則可免于收購。參議會於辯論此案時，原則上對於收購糧食政策並未反對，然有若干參議員認爲收購每一公斤稻穀台幣二十七元五角過低，組織激烈爭論後終仍多數通過原案。就此案而論，全省多數人民均表贊同，而持反對論者，僅爲少數大地主階層。據糧食局統計，全省大地主共有七千二百五十二戶。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北廿九日電〕台省參議會一致通過呈請中央，准許台省提前實施縣市長民選案。按白崇禧部長蒞台宣慰時，所頒之一三五字第一號佈告中，曾有台灣縣市長提前民選，其辦法與日期由台省參議會擬具呈報內政部核准施行一項。現台省參議會認爲台省：（一）人口調查淸楚，（二）土地測量完竣，（三）警衛辦理妥善，（四）道路修築完成，（五）敎育普及，（六）人民均受國民兵訓練，（七）人民均能行使四權。以上諸項，均與建國大綱中關於行縣市長民選所須具備之條件吻合。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中共首領的被通緝</h3>
<p>最高法院檢察署昨令全國各高等法院首席檢察官，飭屬嚴緝毛澤東，略謂：據甘肅高等法院院長首席檢察官呈，據成縣參議會議長在作柱等呈，以毛澤東擁兵倡亂，請依法制裁。查該逆毛澤東，竊據國士，稱兵叛亂，禍國殃民，罪大惡極，自應依法緝辦，以伸法紀。我們於報紙上，看見了此一新聞的報道，感觸多端，情難自己，夫毛澤東，國人盡知其爲中國共產黨之首長，而中國共產黨又嘗參加抗戰，戰後又嘗參加政治協商會議與國內各政黨團體，協商和平建國方案者，乃不期政協之墨瀋未乾，整編統編之協議，不但未能實現，抑且又復以兵戈相見於沙塲，國內和平，未能恢復。本報鑒於戰後全國人民惟一之願望在和平，曾一再呼籲，希望中共能以人民利益爲重，解除黨的武裝，以其軍力交付於國家，以一個在民主政治下一般政黨的姿態，爲國家民族謀福利。詎料言者諄諄，聽者藐藐。近數月來，中共的武裝鄧隊且變本加厲，在中國各處擁兵作亂，自東北，華北，西北以至其它各處。且又勾結外力，四處蠢動，公然對我政府加以侮辱，是其行爲，直同叛國。我們早就說：對於中共的這些罪行，政府是應該下令討伐的。然而直到如今，政府還沒有這種表示。今茲最高法院檢察署的通令，飭屬嚴緝，務獲究辦，以伸法紀，僅對毛澤東而發，純爲一司法的間題：此與政府對毛澤東所領導的中共態度，其間雖或不無關連，但就案情而論，此一通緝令僅涉及毛澤東個人，與其所領導的政黨無關，實與一般刑事通緝無甚分別。國民黨中常會近又將舉行會議，國務會議亦將於下周集會，據報載消息，是項會議席上，將有重要決議。無論此項決議的性質如何，由於毛澤東之被通緝，使我們引起下列的幾點感想：</p>
<p>首先我們不得不提出的就是對於最高法院首席檢察官的執法如山，表示無限的欽佩。我們上而已經說過，毛澤東是中共的首領，而中共雖擁兵作亂，政府却迄未頒布討伐之令，而且在國務會議席上，還保留着中共的席次，虛位以待；是政府對於中共尙未拋却希望，似甚明顯。但最高法院的檢察官，依據人民的呈訴，審核事實，認爲毛澤東罪大惡極，應予通緝，務獲究辦，以伸法紀。這一方面固然充分的表示了司法的尊嚴，一方面也表示出了首席檢察官的忠貞爲國，實在令人肅然起敬。我們要曉得中共的問題是一個政治問題，對於這一問題的解決，不能求諸法律。可是毛澤東身爲中國人民，擁兵作亂，觸犯刑章，是其所爲，實應受國法的制裁，自屬毫無疑義。此一通緝令的頒發，全國人民爲之振奮。不論政府對中共問題將作如何的處置，其首領旣經通緝，自必應循司法的程序，受國法的制裁。</p>
<p>在最高法院檢察署的通緝令裏，我們所看到的毛澤東的罪狀，有：「竊據國土，稱兵叛亂」；從這些辭句裏看來，則毛澤東僅犯了刑法第一百條的內亂罪，原條文說：「意圖破壞團體，竊據國土，或以非法之方法，變更國憲，顚覆政府，而着手實行者，處七年以上有期徒刑，首謀者，處無期徒刑」：其所應處的刑，至重也不過是無期徒刑。但中共的勾結外力是事實，是其首領所犯者，不特爲內亂罪，抑且有外患罪。刑法第一百零三條所規定的外患罪是這樣的：「通謀外國或其派遺之人，意圖使該國或他國對於中華民國開戰端者，處死刑或無期徒刑。」現在此案旣經按司法程序提出通緝，此後「務獲究辦」，我們的檢察官公忠體國，自必能控以應得之罪而繩以國法的。</p>
<p>對於中共首領的被通緝，我們不禁感到無限的遺憾。中國人民之希望毛澤東所領導的中共，能够立卽放下武器，恢復和平，不可謂不殷切；但中共對於人民的要求未能接受，終之不得不有此通緝令之頒發。就感情上言，這畢竟是遺慷的事。可是勾結外力，竊據國土，擁兵作亂，此而可忍，又將置國法於何地？最高法院檢察署，顧名思義，爲最高檢察機關，爲維護國法的尊嚴而有此項命令的頒發，是足以贏得國人同情的。</p>
<p>我們於此有不能不指出的是，中國共產黨的首領旣被通緝，而國務會議裏還爲中共保留了席次。固然前者是一個司法問題，而後者是一個政治問題。它們似乎不能混爲一談。可是首領旣被認爲「禍國殃民，罪大惡極」，其所領導的黨，自然也不無問題。一個司法問題固應依法究辦，但在政治方面，自也不能不因司法方面的發展而取必要的措施，以爲配合。否則，總不免有點兒滑稽。至於應該採取怎樣的措施，還有望於政府當局的賢明考慮。</p>

<h3>蘇希望由聯合國歐經會　草歐洲復興方案　傳莫洛托夫已提出建議　三國外長會議似已陷入嚴重困難</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕今日「觀察報』載稱：蘇聯外長草洛托夫在巴黎會黨中聞已提出一項建議，表示蘇聯希望由日內瓦之聯合國歐洲經濟委員會車擬歐洲復興計劃，幷要求經濟委員會應以三分之二之多載票為根據以定其決議。法報繼謂該歐洲經濟委員會秘書長英達爾已間接證實蘇聯提出上述一項建議，至蘇聯所提三分二多數票一項要求，則即為以否決權界予東歐各國，蓋該委員會十七席中東歐國家佔六席故也。聞英外相貝文主張設立一專家委員會，草擬計劃，倘能僅以多數票為根據，則方願交歐洲經濟委員會草擬云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕英蘇法三國外長於本日年後四時十分（格林　治　準時間）舉行第二次會議，商計馬歇爾之援歐計劃，至六時卅五分始散會，並定於卅日午後舉行第三次會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕三強外長今日在法國外交部開會兩小時半後，決定於下星期一下午繼續舉行會議。莫洛托夫今日抵會塲時，笑容可掬，然當蘇代表團由英氏率領退出會塲時，則均目光正視，嚴　似有心事。貝文退出會塲時，亦若愁眉不展，料在此一第二次會議中，發展並未盡如人意。今日之會議原定下午三時開始，但延至四時始行舉行。可靠方面證實延遲一小時係循莫洛托夫之請。莫洛托夫在昨日之會議中，即要求延至今日下午舉行，其竟　在使渠得有充分時間向莫斯科請示，並凖備今日之會議。法外交部發言人今日否認美通訊社所稱皮杜爾曾於今晨與貝文密談之說，英代表團發言人鄭重聲明貝文今日係於開會之時始晤皮杜爾，貝文今晨乘車至郊外兜風而已。在會議嚴守秘密之狀態下，此間觀察家紛紛揣灃　斯科於接獲　洛托夫之第一次報告後，是否已決定會同英法主持馬歇爾之歐洲計劃。自今晟起，巴黎報界即盛傳三強會議已陷入嚴重困難，然負責官方對此等謠言均表示不信。莫斯科電台昨廣播蘇官方通訊社之電文，頗爲此間人士所重視，認為可能即為莫洛托夫就馬歇爾計劃擬採之路綫。該電建議爲澄清馬歐爾計劃之意義起見，三國外長應請美國政府釋明歐洲政府可望獲得美國援助之範聞爲如何。美國凖備以幾許款項指定援歐，放款之際擬附何種條件，國會之批准援歐是否確有把握。如果莫洛托夫果然建談向美國提出此項詢問，則美蘇關於援歐之意見不免立起衝突，馬歇爾前此已明白表示在美國政府向國會聲請批准援歐計劃以前，須光由歐洲提出需要及能力之平衡預算表。此外尙有關於馬歇爾計劃與聯合國歐洲經濟委員會間關係之程序問題，英法為期迅速起見，祇願使該會成為關於馬歇爾計劃之顧問機構，以及向美國政府傳達歐洲國家決議之傳達機構，而最近會在莫斯科晤莫洛托夫之聯合國歐洲經委會秘書米台爾，則力主使該會成為馬歇爾計劃之設計機構。蘇聯態度如何尙不可知。英代表團希望漠洛托夫得以接受英國之意見，即於達到適當時期後再使聯合國歐洲經委會參加設計，同時為加緊此等設計工作起見，應由英蘇法三國為召集國，設立特種委員會進行其事。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕法外長皮杜爾可望於今日向英蘇外長抗議巴黎會談新聞對鐀之事。</p>
<h3>蘇聯官方通訊社透露　蘇耳光疑馬卿計劃　　謂英法建議危及蘇聯本經濟</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿九日電〕巴黎三國外長會議自徇英外長貝文之請張設「絲絨幕」後，蘇聯塔斯社今日初次透露會議眞相一斑。據稱，英法二國所提之程序危及蘇聯本身之五年計劃以及各）種類似之經濟計劃，故蘇聯已使該會擱淺。英法二國之建議預期一種「歐洲各國無所不包之經濟方案，」但蘇聯感覺「各獨立自主民族之內部經濟事務應由其自行解決。」蘇聯代表團對於其與馬歇爾計劃有關部份表示「嚴重懷晟。」二十七日法國各報揭載法方建議細則後，給予蘇聯瓦表團聞明觀點之機會。蘇聯之立塲厥在「會議工作應限於獲得有關各國之適當佔計並加以彙合審查，俾確定歐洲各國對於美國經濟援助之需要。」</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫希望外長會議成功</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿九日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫昨夜在法國外交部內法外長皮杜爾之晚宴席上致辭，表示有希望此次三强外長會議成功者，確屬有理。英貝文外相市長亦對於此次會議，並不眞正悲觀。兩外長此項表示，已證明外傳會議遭遇困難之說為不確。莫洛托夫於表示希望會議得為進展後，謂三國外長均具有克服種種困難之意，故此等希望，確屬有據。『吾人亦記得吾人在戰爭時期所作之犧牲，此等犧牲需要吾人進致和平」。法外長皮杜爾似並不如其他兩外長之樂觀，渠於致歡迎辭時於表示招待不週深致歉意後，即舉出此次會議所面臨之困難，但亦表示希望會議得有積極之收穫。</p>
<h3>奧南瑞等國　擬參加歐洲復興</h3>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電」據此間瑞士官員廿八日談稱：瑞士政府已通知美國及歐洲各有關國家，說明瑞士政府歡迎歐洲之復與計劃，俾各國對此皆有所貢獻，但以不受政治限制為條件。瑞士如受邀請，即將根據此項原則而參加合作云。</p>

<h3>美政府出面干涉　印荷關係轉緩和　雙方將談判組臨時政府</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：自美國發出照會，促請立即組織臨時政府以後，印尼情勢轉趨緩和。可靠之印尼方面稱，東印度羣島之戰爭已因美國之照會而避兌。美國照會之意義，即謂除非荷蘭政府與印尼妥協，荷蘭及印尼將不能獲得美國之貸款。印尼代表團秘書長波狄加多應荷印總督范莫克之請求，前往喬克加卡泰，與索卡諾晤談。據稱，渠將請求索卡諾作書面保證，印尼願接受荷蘭在臨時政府中之主權及決定權。權成方面謂波氏已向范莫克作口頭上之保證。　〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：前印尼總理沙利告新聞記者稱：在其獲有全權保證之要求得到同意時，渠將拒不復職云。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕美國於印尼與荷蘭之危機已達最嚴重階段之今日，已請印度尼西亞共和國立即成立代表整個前荷屬東印度之臨時聯邦政府，並允許給予財政援助。據華盛頓來電稱，國務院方面息，美國政府已請印尼共和國從事合作，以便即時成立臨時聯邦政府，並允諾於該一政府成立後給予財政援助。印尼共和國政府約在兩年以前即已向美國聲請借款一億元，以供復興之用。國務院官員不願表示美國允諾之援助，是否即為此敷。國務院之照會已由美駐巴達維亞總領事傅特遞交印尼共和國當局，轉送現在喬克加卡泰之索卡諾總統。照會內容對臨時聯邦政府之遲遲未能成立，表示關切，並明白表示在得以成立組織此一政府之協議以前，美國進出口銀行不擬考慮貸款。該一照會之副本，並已送交荷蘭方面。同時據吧城來電稱，該地可靠荷方人士相信，荷蘭政府當不致根據印尼總統索卡諾之覆文而與印尼恢復談判獨立。觀察家相信，印荷間之危機已因此進入最嚴重之階段，同時共和國議會之執委會已批准由索卡諾總統接堂政府大權，若干共和國人士相信，如不能由辭職之沙利總理重新組閣，則國民黨回敎黨及左冀黨將組聯合政府。</p>
<p>戰事可免荷方欣慰</p>
<p>〔聯合維亞廿九日電〕美國務院最後致送「備忘錄」，緊急請求印尼共和國政府與荷蘭當局合作設立臨時聯邦政府後，荷印官方今日均表欣慰）。雙方對於美國聲明雖未接置評，但荷蘭懷袖顯因此舉已使決定開始軍事行動失去必要而感安心。吧城政府要員預料今明兩”荷軍發動時將這逮捕，現亦如釋重負，而露笑容。日惹方面，總理沙利今日可望宣布是否復　，蓋美方聲明曾支持其對荷蘭讓步之主張。左派領袖吉里或將承認沙氏有權在未來談判中與荷方簽訂協定，此即沙氏考慮復職前所堅持之條件。又據消息靈通人士稱，美　認領事福特已要求印尼領袖立即答復美國，俾澄淸目前之僵持氣氛。荷印雙方代表今日會在荷蘭總督范莫克私邸會晤，對於美方聲明之影響有所討論。</p>
<p>我請注意僑胞利益</p>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿八日電〕我駐巴達維亞總領事蔣家棟，正忙與各負責當局代表接觸，俾獲悉嚴重政局之最近發展情勢。蔣氏今往晤荷蘭高級委員會主席謝麥航，就外傳印尼共和國欲「焦土抵抗」一事，有所商談，且已電印尼共和國總統素卡諾，提出警告，蔣氏指稱：此事除道義上有問題外，一革命之國家若為革命而「焦」第三者友好國家人民之財產，顯係完全違反國際法思想者，印尼共和國若必欲對撃僑採取此種政策，則勢將自食其果。</p>
<h3>埃將請安理會干涉英埃爭端</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社開羅廿八日電〕埃及政府業已將其要求聯合國安理會出面干涉英埃爭端之照會，送交駐美大使，命其在接獲指令之後，即向聯合國機構秘書長提出，日期極可能為七月三日，據負責人士談稱，埃及將要求：（一）英軍完全撤離埃及與蘇丹；（二）廢除一九三六六年英埃條約及一八九九年關於蘇丹之英埃協定。</p>
<h3>美國報紙一致搞議巴黎會議封鎖新聞　美官方不談馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國報紙對於三強巴黎會議之新聞封鎖，均憶表示抗議。記者有認此項封鎖應由貝交負責者，幽有認應由莫洛托夫負責者。「波的摩爾太陽報」記者華特率直抨擊貝文，責其利用美國代表團之未曾參加放棄公開外交而恢復秘密外交。</p>
<p>然查事實上在美國境內，關於馬歇爾之建議援助歐洲，幽有新聞封鎖之狀態存在。自戰爭時期之三巨頭會議以來，首定情報之缺乏及外界揣測之紛紜，未有更甚於此次者。馬歇爾及國務院官員，在記者招待會中嘗一再請記者等勿得詢問關於援歐計劃之問題，杜魯門總統於被詢及此時亦僅節用馬卿在哈佛大學之言作答，拒絕加以申述。美財長史奈特鑒於外界揣測欲思予以糾正，結果竟引起驚人反響，甚至使一部份人士以爲美政府內部已因援歐問題而呈分裂。美國官員鹽於史奈特之言所引起之反響，態度較前益見緘默。某員今日曾以私人地位告記者，謂關於馬歇爾計劃，目前僅有兩點可述，第一此乃歐洲計劃而非馬歇爾計劃，第二目前根本尙無計劃存在。換言之，即國務院迄尙不曾擬具歐洲之復興計劃，援助之形式迄尙未有特殊之決定。另一保持緘默之原因，乃為避免國會方面過早之警覺及批評，蓋國會中之共和黨孤立份子，具有經濟頭腦之南部諸州頑固民主黨議員，以及兩黨中之反共反蘇份子，如果團結一致，則任何援助計割均將為其所阻也。</p>
<h3>艾帥向參院委會呼籲　要求增加美軍費　謂美軍事實力不及蘇聯</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿八日電〕美國陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾元帥本日在參院財政小組委員會陳述意見，要求增加陸軍部之預算，其言略謂：美國之海陸空軍，已不及蘇聯而居世界第二位。陸軍部雖不認為戰爭有在十二個月內爆發之可能，但此事亦非絕不可能。衆議院將軍事預算核减四萬七千八百萬元，此舉在目下實足以構成對於國家安全之一大危機，故應予以取消。吾人所要求撥給之款項，將用諸發展飛機之製造，良以空軍為美國之第一道防綫故也云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日是電〕陸軍參謀總畏艾森豪威爾今日聲稱：本人就任哥倫比亞大學校長後，仍願保留軍職，為國家安全工作。俟與杜魯門總統及大學董事會成立默契，將隨時應召進京，以備諮詢。</p>

<h3>麥帥總部發表鮮南工作報告　秀露三月政變之內幕</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京廿八日電〕麥帥今日發表三月份朝鮮佔領區報告書，透露朝鮮右派企圖接受南鮮政府未遂。據稱，「三月二日，前重慶臨時韓國流亡政府宣布本身為合法政府，任命諮政委員會，由李承晚任主席，金九副之。軍事當局立即宣布此舉為非法，且鮮有獲得民衆擁護之徵象」。</p>
<p>報告書中對於五月一日朝鮮獨立節，政見不同之人發生衝突，致有若干人死傷一節，表示遺憾。三月廿二日與廿三日，南朝解發生非法總罷工，朝鮮學生予以支援，警察不得不在漢城大學一帶維持秩序。</p>
<p>據聯合社漢城訪員來電稱：三月間之政變，係金九在幕後指使。金九曾數度稱，渠將發表宣言，聲明重慶韓國流亡政府為南鮮政府。此種宣言終於在若千報紙上以其名義公布，但此種行動並未獲得支援，而成泡影。若干觀察家以為金九企岡獲得朝鮮警察之後盾，大抵渠以為獲得此種支援後，美國人將不得不加以承認。金九出此行動時，李承晚正在華盛頓，否認牽涉此事，但急急趕回朝鮮。待返朝鮮時，此一行動，已告熄滅，此乃軍政府干涉之結果。</p>
<p>金九與李承晚兩人均反對期鮮之託管制度，並不與美蘇聯合委員會會合作，彼等雖有一共同之反對目標，但兩人間互爭領袖地位，將來難免分裂。聞兩人因繼續反對託管，已失去左派若干擁護，左派則給同組織朝鮮臨時統一政府。金李兩人似欲先由朝鮮人設立政府，再與美蘇雙方討論朝鮮之統一與獨立。</p>
<p>麥帥報告書中又謂，南鮮人民已繼續採取各項步驟，，準備最後的自治。臨時立法議會為臨時憲法草案，根據民主原則，並准許六十歲以上之男女有投票權。工業情形有進展，二月份煤斤出產未及限量，但鋼鐵出產增加。</p>

<h3>反對日人在南權獵鯨　英向美強硬抗議　認爲日本不應與澳國競爭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕關於東京盟軍最高統帥准許日本組繼第二批捕鯨隊，前往南冰洋捕鯨一事，英國政府業已經由其駐美大使印佛傑貝爾勛爵向美國務院提出抗議。頃悉英國照會之措辭甚為强硬，英國外務部在提出抗議之前，曾研究參加日本第一次捕鯨隊之澳洲觀察者之報告。據該項報告稱，日本捕鯨船並無保藏鯨油設備，（鯨油通常於用諸製造麥其林者）故日本捕鯨隊輒將鯨油堆於船上，僅以鯨之肉作為國內之消耗。按常理鯨油原應經由國際糧食局，公開在世界市塲出售。惟據美國佔領當局聲稱，因日本在去年所消耗之肉類百分之卅四為鯨肉，故日本若不捕鯨，決難應付肉類之供應。關於此點，英國方而稱，日本人民絕非食肉者，吾人認為捕鯨乃攸關日本信譽之問題，日本不應獲准在捕鯨方面與澳洲及其他盟國競爭，澳洲及其他盟國所政備之捕鯨隊，均將鯨魚中之一切副產品提出。此外，日本第二批捕鯨隊雖已在凖備出發，但麥帥之決議，尙未正式通知華盛頓遠東委員會云。</p>

<p>〔中央社東京廿九日電〕煤礦國家管理問題，可為日本兩大政府黨社會民主黨及民主黨合作之考騐。昨日之經濟會議中，所有民主黨籍之各部大臣對經濟平定本部長官和田博雄所提議之煤礦國家管理草案，極力表示反對，渠等指責該項法案，社會主義意識過於濃厚，復太富官僚管制之色彩，極易破壞刻正日見滋長之勞資合作。社會民主黨則仍堅特該黨政策。</p>
<h3>粟栖公然表示歡迎外國投資</h3>

<h3>南政府正式拒絕調查團進入國境　蘇聯指責英美代表具有成見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南斯拉夫京城廿九日電〕南斯拉夫政府今日正式拒絕聯合國巴爾幹調查團希臘邊境糾紛調查小組進入國境。該小組現在希臘薩洛尼卡地方，本月二十五日曾請求准予進入南斯拉夫領土，但南斯拉夫政府告以先須考虛此舉有無必要，在二十八日以前不能答覆，今日始宣布無此必要。政府發言人並稱，聯合國巴爾幹調查團偏向希臘政府且「接受希臘之揑造宣傳」，故已「完全喪失其資格」。</p>

<h3>上海幾經演變成爲今日繁華　徐蔚南廣播「上海的掌故」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨日假座新聲電台，舉辦第十三次星期日特別廣播，請名作家上海市通志館副館長徐蔚南播講「上海的掌故」，茲誌其演詞如下：　上海在現代人看來，已經是世界上的一大都市了。可是很少有人知道，在最初的時候，上海運不過是一個濱海的漁村。那時候上海是一個漁鹽之鄕，居民依賴捕漁煮鹽為生。上海能够成為今日這樣繁榮的都會，原是經過好幾次的演變。</p>
<p>漁村一躍爲商港</p>
<p>從漁村時期變到上海鎮的成立，那是在宋末時代。這時候上海進口的商船漸漸增多，於是置上海鎭，設立了市舶提舉司。所謂市舶提舉司，就是一個專掌外來商船貨物稅收事宜的機關。從這個現象，可以看出上海已從漁村一躍而為商港。這是第一次的變遷。</p>
<p>到了元初，上海由鎭而升為縣，正式成為我國行政上的一個單位。上海的設置為縣，有三個重要的原因：第一，上海已成為海運發動地，因此吳淞江，黃浦江成了船舶雲集之處，上海便成為水手及商買寄居的地方，市面因此繁盛。第二，這時上海濟海之地，產鹽特寫，成為一個重要的大鹽塲。第三，木棉的種植和紡織，這時在上海也發達起來。所以上海已不僅是一個商港，同時也建立了自己的產業，這些都足以使上海日趨繁盛，而有設置縣城之必要。這是上海第二次重要的變遷。</p>
<p>以後經過元明，到了淸代，上海設立江海關，各地來滬的商人更多，上海開始有了各地旅滬商人的集團——會館和公所，十六舖一帶也開始熱閙起來。鴉片戰爭之後，上海成為五口通商之一，接着便開闢租界，外人到上海來的便多起來，形成上海畸形的發展，並且有了南市和租界的分劃。至於把上海稱為特別市，那是在民國十六年以後。</p>
<p>元代一幅熬波圖</p>
<p>老上海有三大產業，就是漁，鹽，棉。現在上海捕魚的事業沒有什麽發展，煮鹽也早已成為過去，所以這兩項產業對於上海歷史的關係，大家已不大注意。至於木棉和土布，到現在知道的人還多，因為上海郊外，譯有不少棉田，不過土布也早已淘汰了。</p>
<p>在漁村時期的上海，捕獲的漁量相當多，如黃魚，黃花魚，鯧魚等所獲尤多。現在則上海已成為工商要埠，需要別處將大量的魚類運入，上海已算不得是一個重要的漁產地，但上海漁輪每年還是有相當的收穫。依戰前統計，上海漁輪的捕獲量，每年有十餘萬担。</p>
<p>說到鹽產，因為舊時上海，東部濱海之地，有了煮鹽的大鹽塲，稱做下沙，宋，元，明三朝，這個地方產鹽都特別豐富，算是松江府下的最大鹽塲之一，也是鹽說收得最多的地方。到了淸初鹽產漸表，至今早已成為陳蹟。現在浦東還有「三灶鎭」「六灶鎭」等名稱，這個「灶」，就是當時煮鹽的灶，那時的鹽塲，在現在這些地名上還可以看出一點痕跡。元代至順元年下沙塲的鹽司陳椿，曾就煮海法度，繪製一卷「熬波圖」，從這圖裏還能看出那時煮鹽的程序和鹽民生活。</p>
<p>白門朱屋無懶婦</p>
<p>至於上海的棉產，元明以後一直很發達，棉出佔據了上海地域的大半，鄕村婦女也都以紡續為業。明嘉靖年間，倭寇侵入上海，恣意焚掠騷擾，但不能奪去這份棉產。到了萬曆年間，上海的棉織品風行各地，甚至還輸入京城去。由於棉業如此興盛，上海便日見富裕，居民的生活也漸漸奢侈起來。</p>
<p>談到棉田，我們還要一提元朝的黃道婆。相傳黃道婆是松江府東五十里烏泥涇地方的人，她在元代元貞年間從廣東　州回來，把她善於紡績的技術傳授給上海人，所以她成為改良上海紡織工其和方法的第一人。她把紡績的新法傳授以後，家家婦女，不論貧富，都是勤於紡績，所以當時咏黃道婆祠詩，有旬云：「白門朱屋無懶婦」。她去世以後，人們很感激她的功績，在烏泥涇建立黃道婆祠，至今因年代久遠，祠已廢圯，再也找不到原有的影跡。黃道婆的墓，也已沒有了，但墓墓在鳥泥涇還　約可以辨認。</p>
<p>猶留陳跡在南市</p>
<p>現在上海的市容，的市容，和老上海比較，不用說早已脫胎換骨，完全兩樣。就是在近數十年內，也大不相同。舉例說，聳立在黃浦灘的江海關，最初是建於淸道光二十六年，至成豐七年再建，至光緒十七年又重建。現在江海關的房屋是在民國十四年重建的。又如公司商店櫛比鱗次的南京路，為中區最熱閙的街道，可是在光緒年間，那兩旁還都是中國舊式的建築，代步的工具只有馬車和人力車。現在已都是西式的高大建築，路上的景象亦與從前完全不同了。　比較起來，南市還保存着一點老上海氣息。就以城隍廟來說，雖然屢經滄桑，勝利之後，經過一番條飾，但除了湖心亭前面添了一座李平書先生的銅像和小世界改為商塲之外，大體上還保持着舊時的風光，連那些商店，茶樓和攤販的原有　址，還跟許多年前一樣，沒有多大的變動。南市的城隍廟可以說是一個很有趣味的廟市，由此還可以看出舊上海城的古樸，和現在繁華的中心區對照着音，郤另有一種不同的氣象。</p>

<p>上海中等敎育研究會，爲同人暑期生活問題，將發表宣言，向有關當局呼籲，原文如下：「我們中等敎師待遇菲薄，尤以私立學校敎師的待遇，須視學費收入是否充裕，學校經濟是否公開，而後決定。一般中學敎師，每週授課少則二十鐘點，多至三十幾點鐘，在這繁忙的工作中，食不飽，衣不暖，每天要憂油鹽柴米，生活旣不安定，如何能敬業藥業？本學期初，有些私校的發薪辦法，有一學期一次發，有三個月發一次，自然在這開明的學校當局，認爲優待敎師，使敎師們能够得到一筆較大的數目，但是物價大天髙漲，因此開學的一筆錢，到了學期中途已經不够用了，到現在巳臨到不能維持的地步，何况還有不少學校仍是按月發薪的？現在距離下學期開學，尙有一段漫長的假期，在這物價普遍上漲的今天，按月有收入的敎師尙不能維持，最近沒有收入，將怎樣渡過這段困苦的日子呢？中等敎育研究會同仁，有鹽於此，對於同仁生活的艱苦，實有切膚之痛，我們請求：（一）敎育行政當局，在這學期結束之際，立即調査需要救濟的敎師，給予一次救濟金。（二）如果救濟金一時無從籌措，可內政府向銀團洽商兔息，或低利救濟貨款，貸予需要救濟的敎師。我們要求並不大，賢明的當局如接受實旅了，受惠的千百敎師，却感恩極大。政府在安定民生，這義意上，收效也極大。特此誠懇呼籲，敬祈採擇」</p>

<h3>紡調會招待棉紗議價　舉辦共同配銷制　廿支紗每件規定八百八十萬元　紗商得照廠價加利潤百分之五</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會近以紗價上漲，奉中央電令，切實繼續執行議價，迭經召集會議商討未獲具體決定。昨日下午五時許，中央銀行總裁張嘉璈，特召請第六區棉紡公會全體理監事，在其寓邸茶叙。經部陳部長，紡調會主委鄒秉文等亦出席，討論迄八時許，終獲最後結果要點爲：（一）舉辦共同配銷制。（二）廿支紗議價，每件規定爲八百八十萬元。（三）此後棉紗議價，將採機動方式。該項辦法，當由紡調會以代電，分發京滬兩市府，蘇浙皖三省政府，武進，無錫，南通三縣政府，第六區棉紡公會，及上海市紗商業公會等機構，即日起査照辦理在案。茲將詳細辦法，探誌如次：</p>
<p>（一）棉紗價格，依據生產成本，參酌市面行情，採取機動方式，隨時合理議定，以收平價之效。（二）由本會督同國營民營各紗廠，準備大量棉紗，辦理共同配銷，暫假中國紡織報設公司辦理各項手續。（三）各支別棉紗價格，業經本會議價小訊委員會議定：十支紗每件爲六百一十二萬元，十六支紗每件爲七百七十四萬元，二十支紗每件爲八百八十萬元，卅二支紗每件爲一千二百九十四萬元，四十二支紗每件爲一千七百廿四萬元。所有以上議定價格，均係廠盤最髙售價。紗商售紗，得照廠盤價格，另加繳用利潤，但最多以百分之五爲限。至以上未列之各支別紗及各種商標牌號之棉紗，應槪依塲習慣，比照定價。總以同支別棉紗，不超過以上議定最髙售價爲限。（四）棉紗價格議定公吿後，國營民營各紗廠，均應絕對依照實行。倘再有遠反議價，私售黑市情事，一經査獲，定予依法嚴懲。</p>
<h3>紡建董監聯席會議　決定營業方針　如煤源供應正當局勢良好三個月內可全部恢復生產</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司第二屆第一次董監事聯席會議，於昨日下午四時，在該公司會議室，繼續舉行，全體董監事十五人均到，由董事長陳啓天主席，討論迄七時許散會。重要議案如次：</p>
<p>（一）營業方針（甲）增加生產：如煤源供應正常，東北情勢良佳，則擬在三個月內，恢復全部未開工之紗錠及布機。（乙）原料供應：（子）原棉方面，第一季（自上年八月迄本年七月）可收一百五十萬擔，下季計劃可收三百萬擔。（丑）機料，（寅）物料。以上兩項，國內能自產或可購到者，則先儘國內採購。公司所屬靑島第一化工廠，可於本月中開工，產製燒碱，供公司所屬之印染廠利用。鋼絲針布方面，公司每年需要量，最低需一千套，大部將向中國紡織機器公司採辦，小部向國外採辦。（丙）成品配銷：內銷方面，大方針仍遵照紡調會決策辦理。外銷方面，將以公司目前產量百分之二十，代政府外銷。</p>

<h3>銀樓復業絕望　請願代表已返滬</h3>
<p>全國各地銀樓代表，前晋京請願，要求改善銀樓業買賣飾金管制辦法，提髙限價及配售飾金，原料等。此事已經全國經濟委員會於日前議決，維特原議。其理由爲在目前金融動濕之情形下，對經濟緊急措置方案所規定之處理銀樓業務辦法，如予以變更，將波動外匯及刺激物價。故此次全國銀樓業雖數度請願，結果毫無收獲。本市入入京顧代表吳彭年姚桂卿陳德彰發雲良等四人，已於昨晨返滬。據表示此次行政院方面曾提出减低飾金成色，恢復賣買一節，各地銀樓代表因工人技術，顧客心現及營業上諸問題未予接受，是以對變更飾金買賣辦法，在短期間無發現可能。關於本市大小銀樓今後存廢問題，公會方面將於今日午後召開理監事會凝後，予以決定。</p>
<h3>製造捲烟　原鷗收購困難</h3>
<p>本市華商菸廠業衰落主因</p>
<p>華商捲烟廠近多减少生產，甚至减工，考其原因，除銷路狹窄營業衰落外，成本髙昻，亦爲主要因素。其中如菸業一項，我國美種菸葉產區，本在豫·魯·皖三省，自山東劇戰，膠濟路　斷後，靑州菸葉，已完全絕跡。安徽菸葉產量不多，且當地小型烟廠林立，悉被就近搜購，運滬者亦甚少。剩下河南許昌一地，所產菸葉，供不應求，且沿途運費浩犬，市價愈抬愈髙，現已達二萬六七千元一磅，反較品質上乘之美菸昻貴。（照官價結匯，美國最好菸瑛到滬，成本僅一萬八千元。）</p>
<p>再如捲烟用之紙圏，輸入限額之進口貨只能供給實需要量三分之一。民豐造紙廠只能供給五分之一，如今後紙圈進口，或民豐生產不能增加，則捲烟產量，勢將受嚴重影響。至於鍋精紙，亦因國內生產不足，（僅華鋁銅精廠一家，且已停工數週，）及進口限制關係，無法供給需要。工資方面，捲烟之包裝工作，至今尙利用人工，工資亦頗高昻。此外捲烟廠最大之困難，厥爲運轉資金之不足。若向外借貸，期短利髙，廠方在輕濟方面，亦有難爲籌措之感。在此種種困難之下本市捲烟工業，前途殊覺黯澹。</p>
<h3>本年外銷棉紗　估計可達百萬件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕報載當局對我國外銷紗布，將以去年全國國民營各紗廠紗布生產總額，供應國內需要，復以本年增產之數量輸出國外。茲據某紡織業權估計：如該訊果屬確實，則本年可供外銷之棉紗，勢將大量增加。蓋以去年各支棉紗生產量計，國營廠約四十六萬件，民營廠約六十萬件，生產總額不過一百萬件以上。本年產量佔計，國營廠約可產八十萬件，民營廠約可產一百二十萬件，生產總額估計可達二百萬件左右。則外銷棉紗，估計可達百萬件左右。惟此項估計生產量，迄米恢復至戰前生產狀况。蓋戰前我國棉紗生產量，每年可達二百五六十萬件云。</p>

<p>〔長沙訊〕湘省瀏陽　陵土產夏布，歷史悠久，素負盛名。民廿年前行銷全國遠東及南洋美洲，抗戰期問，國內銷路頗佳。復員後，因外國紗布源源傾銷，國產夏布竟至無人問津。按夏布爲農村家庭手工業，自續麻至紡織，需時有多達半年者。是以產量不多，而成本亦昻，惟較之國內外所產綢紗布料價格，仍屬低廉。目前兩堆生產量爲數甚少，如一次收起四五十疋，即感無法凑集。夏布種類，現分帳夏，印（花）夏，中漂，中細，上細，特細數種，市價每疋（計五市丈）約十萬至二十萬云。</p>
<h3>杭州物價下跌</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿八日電〕杭州物價因年度結算銀根緊東，已大致下跌，然人心看髙，昨疲暗緊，故預計僅穩定四五日。</p>
<h3>本年產量可達五萬担　台茶外銷前途樂觀　壽景偉發表赴台視察經過</h3>
<p>茶葉外銷不振，其主要原因不外中外市塲難得平衡，此外如國內無統籌推銷機構，及國外價格不能劃一，以後造成國內茶商無法集中，國外茶價逐步慘跌之現象。中國茶業聯營公司有鑒及此，爰決定振興外銷辦法，並聯合著名洋商，參加合作。其辦快第一步，先將去年度各茶州商抵押於中國農民銀行外銷茶八萬箱，請中外茶葉專家，分別從事評價評級，現祁門部份業已完成。屯綠，平水，亦得次第完竣，俟全部吿成，並經國行同意撥發資金，交由該公司轉交各茶商，將所押箱茶贖出。再由該公司另設機構，集中推銷，以謀統一。</p>
<p>該公司總經理壽景偉，爲擴充業務計，決定對台曰灣茶業，亦照此辦法辦理。壽氏爲此，曾於本月十七日赴台，主持台省該公司開幕事宜，並赴各產茶及製茶區，普遍視察，已於上週抄公畢返滬。據稱：台省出產烏龍茶紅茶，向馳名世界，尤以烏龍蜚聲最著，遍及歐美及近東各地。戰前全台最髙產量，曾達四百萬斤，全台茶園擴展會至四萬五千四百五十五甲，（每甲合十四畝半）。製造廠規模宏大，全部機械化。據調査所須，台北佔四十九所，新竹五所，台中一百三十七所，高雄十二所。過去日人侵佔時代，合茶輸出列爲大宗，非僅活潑農村經濟，且可充裕國庫，爭取外匯，向爲我國茶葉業勁敵。在戰時，以日人力謀糧食增產，茶田荒蕪，製造廠逐漸破壞，其生產自已今非昔比。惟悉，今年全台產量，仍可獲五萬担，如此最近兩週內，不受颱風影響，總額或可超過此數。</p>
<p>又據佔計，其中可得烏龍百分之十，按烏龍在台最爲名貴，按照海外價格，平均每磅爲美金五角五分，紅茶則可售四角餘。壽氏又稱：此行經過，長感興奮者，厥爲台省各機關首長，及地方人士，均能精誠合作。對台茶之推動最有協助者，爲台灣銀行之核准茶貸台幣二億元，其中包括收購，初製，加工，運銷等部門，如將來對外推銷，取得一致行動，保持劃一價格，則台茶前途極爲樂觀。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據中國農民銀行負責人談稱：本年度茶業產量不佳，原因爲卅五年度存茶至今尙在押未曾銷出，各茶農以卅五年存茶無銷路，本年度新茶亦勢必如此，爲避免虧蝕起見，故對做今年新茶之興趣索然。該行爲挽救華茶外銷危機，將建議政府，請定價收購卅五年度存茶，以鼓勵生產新茶。在政府收購之定價中，必需予商人以合法利潤，否則亦難收效云。</p>
<p>又據稱：中信局現標售之陳茶，均係民國廿年至卅四年之老茶，其中甚多有霉腐及品質變壞者，爲願處新茶銷路，該行亦將建議將此項老茶全部焚燬，以全力推廣新茶云。</p>
<p>本年茶產量少質佳</p>
<p>本年度茶產行將下市，各地產區所產新茶，品質均較往年爲佳，其原因有二：（一）各產區今年氣候甚佳，我國製造茶業，尙未至機械化階段，用人工製造茶葉，必需氣候好，始能蒸發茶葉中之永份。（二）中國農民銀行茶貸舉辦適當，茶農在用貸款做好茶時，並可押與農行，如此可免資金擱淺。</p>
<p>但本年度茶葉所產之品質雖佳，產量却極少，經農行澈査其原因，如爲自米價上漲後，成本加髙人工昂貴，農行貸款太小，無法支持，故祇有停頓。現輸出推廣委員會爲挽救華茶危機，將會同財政部經濟部，及中央銀行等，商討加强華茶產區之產量及國外運銷之辦法，聞可能由農行放寬加工貸款限度，保障茶商茶農有合法之利潤云。</p>
<h3>輸管會招待管制　並未歧視美商</h3>
<p>關於美商致電該國國務院，攻擊我國輸管會苛待美商，並請求美國當局再考慮對華援助云云，昨據輸管會發言人吿稱：美國商人攻擊我國輸入管制辦法已非一次，該美商此種之質疑全屬誤解。現可分作二點解釋：</p>
<p>（一）輸管會自奉令執行輸入管制辦法以後，從未徧袒某方，而苛求他方，爲嚴庽執行輸入管制，各方面自多不滿，此不獨限於洋商，即華商亦表不滿，事實可以證明，輸管會並無歧視美商情形</p>
<p>（二）美國稱輸管會准許進；者，均係豪門巨當之物資，此點亦僅爲多疑之猜測而已。輸管會自成立迄今，從未准許豪門巨富利用特種關係，運入物資，彼等所進；之物資，同樣需管輸管會核准，在限額以內進口，而在限額外及禁止進口之物資，被輸管會扣留，或不許進口者甚多。此有賬可査，不日當可公開發表此項數字，使各方面能了解其中內情。根據以上二點，希望美國商人能質疑全屬誤會，決非事實云。　又據關係方面透露，該會對美商之質疑，已擬就一文件，逐條加以駁斥解釋，經該會主任委員張嘉教氏核准後，即可由外交部轉呈美國國務院云。</p>
<p>絲織業用紗由公會統配</p>
<p>絲織業紗之各原直接向紡建申諸配紗，現紡建爲簡化配紗手續，令絲織業公會統購統配，該業公會已通令各會員至公會登記，每月需要量，登記期已於昨（廿九）日截止，過期不登記以自願放棄現紗權利，不准補辦手續。</p>
<p>本年全國棉田估計</p>
<p>農林部棉產改進諮詢委員會及中華民國權器棉紡織工業同業公會聯合會發表，本年各省棉田均有增加，推究其因，不外三端：（一）八年抗戰，棉農彼害之餘，種子缺乏，本年棉產改進處有大量良種之供應。（二）金融機關對於棉農切實扶助，棉花生產貸款（包括實物如肥料藥品等）普遍之貸放，使棉農生產成本不憂缺乏。（三）本年春季棉花播種以前，棉價扶搖直上。總上三因，均爲增進棉田極優越之條件。</p>
<p>此次調査，以本年六月一日以前爲限，且有若干縣以情形特殊，或未能實地調査，如河南之安陽湯陰；或以工作不易，調査未能精密，如蘇北鹽城阜寗及魯南等數縣。茲將各省棉田數字列表於後：</p>
<p>省別棉田面積（千市畝）</p>
<p>河北　六〇〇〇</p>
<p>山東　二八〇〇</p>
<p>山西　六六〇</p>
<p>河南　四〇〇〇</p>
<p>陜西　三一八〇</p>
<p>湖南　九九〇</p>
<p>山西　二八〇</p>
<p>湖北　七二〇〇</p>
<p>安微　七一〇</p>
<p>江蘇　七〇〇〇</p>
<p>浙江　一六二〇</p>
<p>四川</p>
<p>三四〇〇</p>
<p>遼寧　一二〇〇</p>
<p>合計　三九〇四〇</p>
<p>本年棉花播種期間，天氣尙屬良好，雖黄河流域若千地域，略嫌乾燥，然大體論，尙無甚影響。長江流域若千地區，如華容等縣，五月上旬如太嘉等區，四月下旬至五月上旬，溫度離略嫌低小，然於棉之生育，尙無大碍。</p>
<p>綜觀本年全國棉田有三九·〇四〇·〇〇〇市畝，較本會發表之二九·四一八·〇〇〇市畝，增加九·六二二·〇〇〇市畝，衡之與吾人預期雖有相差，但在戰亂之中，有此趨向，亦足差强人意，如時局淸明，其增產之數字，決不僅此而已。</p>

<h3>前經監團查封紗布　全部交紡調會處理</h3>
<p>前經濟偵察團爲撲滅非法商人投機，曾査獲大量囤積棉紗布。現該團已宣吿撤銷，該項査獲封存之貨物，現奉令全部交由經濟部紡織事業調節委員會業務處負責處理。據有關方面消息：關於接收所有査封紗布之處理，聞於下月中可分批標賈。</p>
<p>又訊，市府關於過止棉紗漲風問題，已飭紗廠及棉業公會限於本日以前，査報所存製紗原棉數量，準備下月起展開澈査倉庫存棉，如有填報不實情事，即予依法究辦。</p>

<h3>揭開好萊塢找幕</h3>
<p>— 好萊塢十六日航訊　本報特派員毛樹清</p>
<p>好萊塢神秘嗎？並不。光滑的馬路，整齊的建築，和其它許多美國城市沒有分別。終年照射的陽光，漫野遍地的棕桐樹，乃至於狂熱興奮的中南美的西班牙情調，加利福尼亞任何一個城鎮都可以看到，也並非好萊塢有！</p>
<p>但是，好萊塢畢竟是神秘的，沒有到好萊塢的人，一定會假想：好萊塢滿街都是電影明星，電影明星，電影明星在任何國家，都過著浪漫荒誕的生活，我在沒有來西岸以前，聽許多「紐約客」講起，他們說：好萊塢是瘋狂的，你將會沈醉在這個瘋狂的人海內！</p>
<p>投資多少　是一個大關鍵</p>
<p>事實並沒有傳說那樣瘋狂，在我逗留在好萊塢九天的印象，我覺得，好萊塢「辦實業」的空氣，比「要藝術」.的空氣濃厚得多，資本主義的社會是工商第一，我不相信好萊塢那些藝術工作者，在為追求一個藝術的理想而努力。當然，在好萊塢，也有為藝術抱負而生活著的人，例如，我所碰見的哥倫比亞影片公司的一位佈景設計者，更汀聲先生，我看他一頭藝術室的蓬鬆頭髮，一套油膩已經很重的粗呢西裝，他的談話，他的行動，乃至於他的腦筋中的理想，似乎已經隔離了，不，至少是暫時忘記了現實生活。但是，像這樣的人，畢竟不多，我在好萊塢接觸到的公司老闆，編劇，導演，演員，他們一開口，便是誇張自己的豪富，或者他們投資於電影事業的資產，他們覺得拿這些話，對一個遠增而來的中國新聞記者考誇耀，會場加他們的身份和地位。</p>
<p>我並不批評他們不應該，工商社會是資本第一，一張電影片子的好壞，投資多少，是一個非常大的關鍵，一位老闆問我：一張中國國產影片，要多少資本？我說，我不十分清楚，大概至少得一萬萬到五萬萬元。他又問：合多少美金？我一算大概好幾萬美金。他哈哈大笑起來：「那怎麼成？我們一張片子，至少化二百萬元，多的到一千多萬」！旁邊一位導演，更接著說：「也有到二千萬美金的」！</p>
<p>這不過是舉一個例，好萊塢的千千萬萬人，生活在藝術圈子中的，他們常常把錢的數字，當「聖經」一樣背誦。我在好萊塢的短短逗留中，有很多人對我說：大歌星萍克勞斯貝，替留聲機公司灌片，唱歌一小時，美金五千元。硬派小生克拉克蓋實，去年和米高梅公司訂了十年長期合同，每星期的薪水是七千五百美元。據說：這兩位大明星，是當今好萊塢收入最豐厚的人。告訴我的人，還特別加了按語：「注意哪，合同是十年，全世界沒有一個老闆，肯這樣慷慨，把一個年青明星，養到老態龍鐘」！</p>
<p>我會見哥倫比亞影片公司製片人凱尼黛先生的時候，他說：「，哥倫比亞現在付給大明星狄克鮑威爾的薪水是每星期兩萬塊，事後很多人懷疑這數字。他們說：加李古柏在米高梅，現在只拿兩千塊錢一個星期。</p>
<p>全球財富　都送到好萊塢</p>
<p>神秘的數目字，造成了好萊塢的神秘。如今，全世界的財富，都乖乖的送到好萊塢來，（我不知道蘇俄有沒有放映美國電影）。堆砌著好萊塢的一點一滴的繁榮。現在，好萊塢有的是：全世界最「貴族」的生活，五千萬塊錢一幅的碧蕪山的住宅，六十八塊錢一天的旅館，全世界最講究的服裝，一九四七年的漂亮汽車。好萊塢大街，夕陽大街，盡是華美的餐廳，咖啡館，和不知多少大大小小的夜總會，還有「掛羊頭，賣狗肉」的所謂「中國戲院」！</p>
<p>中國戲院　門首石獅把守</p>
<p>中國戲院在好萊塢大街上，宮殿式的雄偉的外表，門口站着一對中國運來的「石獅子」，還刊上中國的對聯。裏面還是映的美國電影，據說：美國人到好萊塢的遊客，是終年不絕的，聰明的戲館老闆，就利用這點「新奇」的心理賺錢。</p>
<p>賺錢的方法，在好萊塢是應有盡有的，多少人「寄在」在神秘的電影事業上。好萊塢的電影事業，是第一次歐戰以後，才大規模的展開，好萊塢的人口，也在這二十年之內激增。這次大戰結束以後，從前出身內地的軍人，經過洛杉磯在好萊塢遠征到海外，回美國以後，帶着太太，都搬來洛杉磯附近居住，原因是賺錢容易，天氣好，見識廣！</p>
<p>廿年光陰　荒土變住宅區</p>
<p>有一個地理上的觀念，是急需說明的那便是洛杉磯和好萊塢的關係。不但中國人鬧不清，就是東岸的美國人，也是糊裏糊塗的。我打個譬喻：洛杉磯定是上海，好萊塢就等於江灣或虹口，江灣是上海市的一部份，好萊塢也是洛杉磯的一部份。三四十年前，洛杉磯還不過一個可憐的小海港，好萊塢也是漫野淒涼，許多芝加哥，紐約，迪屈魯的資本家，賺了錢到好萊塢買一片荒山，蓋了洋房，在這兒消磨晚年，原因是：好萊塢的陽光好，環境好。</p>
<p>但是，曾幾何時，滄海變成了桑田！二十年間，好萊塢搖身一變，成了電影事業的聖城，成了青年男女們的耶魯撒冷和麥加。好萊塢不僅和洛杉磯打成一片，而且，不停的擴大和發展，一直貫通到海邊。二十年前太平洋濱的荒　土丘，現在都成了全世界最名貴的住宅區，馬路像螺絲釘一樣，盤旋曲折在山　峯頂之間。</p>
<p>為了畏懼地震的緣故，洛杉磯好萊塢，沒有像紐約芝加哥上海那樣的高空建築，一個整齊清潔的完完全全平面的都市，也是世界平面積最廣的都市。在洛杉磯和好萊塢生活，如果沒有一輛自備轎車，那真是天大的苦事。公共汽車並不太多，而且走得太慢，洛杉磯和好萊塢，是沒有地道車的。</p>
<p>在我初到洛杉磯的幾天之中，我曾為了交通問題煞費心機。好萊塢的高價的旅館，駭得我不能不住在洛杉磯城裏，但是，這二十英里的交通，就非常困難，一直到我找着了兩位美國朋友以後，勞他們的駕，每天開車子解送着我。</p>
<p>「我的朋友」福格爾，十多年前當過電影導演，最早的「陳查理探案」，是他導演的，福格爾認為：第一個「陳理查」之死，是好萊塢的一大損失，戰爭期間，福格爾當陸軍中校，遠征到養大利，我在羅馬認識他，是由梵蒂岡公使謝壽康博士為我介紹的。</p>
<p>人老珠黃　黃金時代太短</p>
<p>福格爾現在經營着一家留聲機公司，他是董事長兼總經理。和他同事的一位勞蘭，詹姆士，也是羅馬戰場上的朋友，他那時是管理軍中廣播事業的上尉，他常常在意大利誇耀着他的太太。</p>
<p>他太太瑪摩，是十多年以前好萊塢有相當地位的女明星，妙懂得很多電影界的內幕。她常常自己感歎：「人老珠黃，一切都不中用了」！她說：電影明星的黃金時代太短，她們都怕老，他們也怕老！她說：大部份的明星們，在黃金時代拼命享受揮霍，能夠積錢成為富翁的，也有，但比較的很少。</p>
<p>勞蘭夫婦駕車帶我遊大洛杉磯全市，我們從最古開闢的城內的奧利芙大街出發，一直到太平洋海岸的羅斯福公路，中間翻過若干丘陵，若干山坡，一路儘是講究的住宅。這些住宅的主人，有電影明星，有高級軍官，也有富商大買。勞蘭太太指給我：碧蕪山背面，沿太平洋海濱的一排整齊的住宅，說：「這些都是瑪麗戴維斯的不動產」。接着，她又說：「你大概沒聽見過吧，一個十多年前的紅星」！</p>
<p>碧蕪山背　影星「集中營」</p>
<p>碧蕪在好萊塢的背後，從地圖上看，在洛杉磯的西段，那兒是美女的「集中營」，是第一流影星的住宅區，我到洛杉磯第二天，坐旅行公司的遊覽車潯遊覽車漫遊好萊塢，從好萊塢到碧蕪山之間，一路上盡是各式各樣的「夜總會」，導遊的人說着：這是離開的？那幾個，那幾個明星常在這兒出入。有許多夜總會，是「解甲歸田」的明星自己經營的，他們雖然退了伍，但是，他們靠着後一代的勇士們，仍然生活在好萊塢</p>
<p>碧蕪山上，我看見了　泰妮，蓬納坦娜的住宅。我記得泰隆鮑華（二十世紀福斯公司臺柱）的住宅，在加李古柏的對面。碧蕪山上有一個角落，呌做「音樂匯」，那兒有一條三叉路，三個角上住着三個大歌星：狄安娜寶萍，納爾蓀，和殷格爾。</p>
<p>這些人都是好萊塢蔽得響的人物。在他們的天地中，他們是德天獨厚的人，全美國多少派駐在好萊塢的新聞記者，追踪着他們的一言一動，刊登在各報的所謂好萊塢專欄。好萊塢人對秀蘭鄧波兒的排場雄停的婚禮，到現在還津津樂道。</p>
<p>主角薪水　每週五百美金</p>
<p>實際上，像這樣真正被稱為紅星的，比較起來，這是很少。在電影天地中，紅杏的收入，是沒有標準的，他們有的和公司訂有長期合同，有的以演出一部片子論價。我參觀了好幾家公司，（另文介紹）我知道二十世紀福斯公司，和第一流所謂紅星訂長期合同的，大約有七八十人。華納公司大約有六十人，哥倫比亞公司的較少。</p>
<p>除了特色的紅明星以外，電影演員還可以分成四級：主角，配角，說話演員，羣眾演員，要有相當技巧的人，跳舞，唱歌，游泳，精通的人，才可以當主角演員，主角的薪水，至少是每星期五百元，配角的薪水在二百五十元至一千元之間（每星期），很少有長期合同的，所謂說話演員，和羣眾演員，都是臨時招聘的，能開口講一二句不相干的話的，比純粹「跑龍套」的羣眾演員，又要高一級。說話演員每天可以拿二十五元到一百元的薪水，羣眾演員每天規定十六元五角。</p>
<p>攝製一片　約需時一百天</p>
<p>我問過好幾家電影公司的製片人，他們的答覆幾乎都相同：完成一部影片所需的時間，是十二個到十四個星期，除非有不得已的情形是例外。臨時演員在製片過程中，每天都必須到塲，因為有許多精透，必須重拍，拍二次三次，甚至到十次以上的！</p>
<p>臨時演員規定每星期六天，每天八小時的工作，如果廠方為了趕工，需要八小時以外的超額工作，廠方按照原來工資的一倍半加給酬勞。二十世紀福斯公司陪我參觀的職員約翰福耳告訴我：晚上攝影的很少，銀幕上的夜景，都是用燈光假裝的。</p>
<p>經紀人　幕後神通廣大</p>
<p>最令人不可思議的，是電影演員的「經紀人」（Agent），這些人是好萊塢最有權威的幕後人物。他們的「神通廣大」，令我驚倒。經過他們的手掌心，紅演員可以變黑，年青初出茅廬的小伙子，可以一舉成名。</p>
<p>從頭牌紅星到十六塊五角的臨時演員，凡是在銀幕上出現，靠演電影吃飯的人，幾乎每個人都有他的經紀人，廠方要攝製一張影片，需要多少多少人和角色，先通知他們經紀人，經紀人像組織內閣一樣，幾天之內送上名單來，然後由製片人在許多名單中，斟酌比較和選擇。名單很少採用清一色的，多半是採取「混合內閣」的方式。</p>
<p>許多頭牌紅星，歡喜訂長期合同訂長期合同，也得透過經紀人，經紀人跟老闆商量，又跟明星討價還價，他們奔走於老闆演員之間，拿幾分之幾的傭金。這些經紀人，都是頂刮刮的幹才，他們有「手面」，有「辦法」，他們在好萊塢，神通廣大！</p>
<p>演員公會　亦是權威組織</p>
<p>除了經紀人以外，還有「演員公會」，也是一個有權威的組織，想在好萊塢立足，沒有公會的支持，是絕無可能的，演員無論大小，入會費都是一百塊，每年常年會費十八塊。據說：申請加入公會，是一件相當繁難的事情，它是踏進好萊塢職業圈子的頭門！</p>
<p>公會現在停止招收任何新會員，原因是：他們覺的現在好萊塢的演員人數，已經太多，（特別是臨時演員），這是一個排斥「新進」的最嚴厲的辦法。但是，如果真的是新發現的「天才」，或者是電影公司大老闆發現的「被埋沒了的豔星」，那種人仍然沒問題。</p>
<p>神秘嗎？經紀人，公會，這是好萊塢的裏層。剝開好萊塢的外衣，透視它的幕後動態，那才真有寫神秘呢！</p>

<p>白蓮涇菜販呼援</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>過去我們本是附近工廠的一羣勞工，八一三後工廠停頓，為謀生活計，不得不借貸小額資本，每天在派出所指定的白蓮涇路一五八弄內販賣菜蔬度日，不料上年冬季，有當地人姜鶴林，集資搭蓋簡陋席棚一所作為商營菜場，希牟厚利，當時我們一致不滿，並　當地公正人士出力聲援，所以未成事實。最近姜鶴林死灰復燃，多方疏通，又要強迫我們入場販賣，不過我們認為姜鶴林要向我們收取　蓋租金，是不合法的，所以堅決反對，不願　塲，抵制富有者在窮人頭上打算，因此籲請各界公正人士加以援手。（被迫的菜販菜妙根等）</p>
<h3>硫酸業的復活</h3>
<p>— 天津廿二日航訊　本報記者李紹林</p>
<p>硫酸的產量在指示着一個國家工業化的程度，據民國二十年的估計，當時世界諸現代化國家硫酸的年產量，差不多都是七百萬噸到一千萬噸，而我國除了少數兵工廠有製酸設備自供需要外，其他的工業用酸，幾乎完全是日本廠商的天下，大量的硫酸從日本運來，賺着五倍以上的高利，直接間接的剝　着中國工業，摧殘着中國工業。</p>
<p>利中酸廠　籌設經過</p>
<p>民國二十一年，在趙雁秋氏奔走下，天津利中製酸公司宣告成立，南開大學化工研究所替她主持了全部設計工作，終於在民國二十三年，利中製酸廠的國產硫酸出面問世，這不是甚麼奇跡，祗是許多有毅力有識見的人努力的成果，日本人焉肯容這中國新興工業發達起來，所以利中製酸廠開始出貨後，日商立刻發動攻勢，當時華北硫酸市場，全在日商大清，清水，金山三家掌握中，他們首以廉價傾銷對利中酸廠加上了莫大壓力，每箱重二百磅的日產硫酸，原售價為七八十元，日本商人為了想打垮利中，於是十元五元的向下狂落，直跌到他們可能的最低價格每箱十二三元，立中所用原料本來購自廣東及英德西班牙等地，成本價高，在日商聯合環攻下，幾乎到了不能支持的地步。</p>
<p>數度摧殘　日商慘敗</p>
<p>就在最艱苦的階級，利中蔣子膽總工程師發現到開權煤礦所挑出的硫酸石可以用為原料，而在開　則是棄品，這個研究成功後，使利中成本每箱低至七元，於是利中乃對日商展開最猛烈的反攻。這時，日本人另出奇兵，打擊利中，從利中煙囪冒白煙，挑出毛病來，設含有三氧化硫，有害津人呼吸器官，強迫該廠停工。南開張伯苓校長聞訊後，把南開化工專家用汽車栽到利中，他說：「今天跟打仗一樣，敵人打到我們家門口了，我們不能把白煙除掉，就不能離去！」研究改善的結果，煙囪裏再不見白煙了。日本人並未就此乾心，他們又憑藉走私從秦皇島向華北運進硫酸，但利中卻更迅速的把出品廉價，銷售到市場上去，幾年的奮鬥，終於使日商在華北的硫酸市場崩潰，而致當時日人在天津經營的鋼鐵廠，洋釘廠，搪瓷廠，也不能不仰賴利中供應硫酸，日本人把利中看　很神奇，曾兩度要求參觀利中，但是都被拒絕了。</p>
<p>擴展業務　籌備分廠</p>
<p>利中美日生產量僅三噸餘，對於山東方面每年一千五百噸的需要，當時祗能供給七百噸，二十五年利中發現博山所出硫磺石，較開蘇成份尤佳，二十六年遂在濟南北門外購地五十畝，籌設分廠，預訂每日產量為二十噸，正在計劃與工，而七七事變發生，濟南分廠的計劃停頓，天津總廠也未日人刦持了。利中從二十三年出貨，到二十六年抗戰，硫酸總產量為三千餘噸，挽回了當時二百萬元的漏　，維持了當時一千二百餘人的生活。</p>
<p>整修復工　供應需要</p>
<p>趙雁秋氏於三十五年秋從後方面到天津，經過幾個月的奔走，由敵偽產業處理局把工廠要回來，又經向各方呼籲獲得貸款，修整了殘舊的設備，現在這工廠已又開始出貨，而產量也接近戰前的產量，每日出產三噸餘，最令他遺憾的當時是蔣予　總工程師已於三十一年在天津抑　逝世。利中製酸是用鉛室法，廠內設備共有十四個礦爐，硫化鐵在專而燃燒後經過儲沉室，到葛氏塔，加硝酸，再經三座鉛室陸續加熱，增加濃度，並排除雜誌，而得硫酸，所產硫酸濃度為波美六十六度，關於那段「白煙」的故事，被改善後的處理，是硫化鐵加熱後所生的氣體要經過四部收煙設備，收煙塔的裏面為瓷磚，以市氣體凝結為液體，通過冷卻器後再通過裝滿焦炭的收煙盒，使白煙附着於焦炭，最後經中和塔白煙囪排出，現在利中除硫酸外，並日產硝酸千餘磅，除自用外，已訂出二億餘元，硫酸則以訂出四億餘元。</p>
<p>勝利後，日本人給我們留下了三個製酸廠，撫順鞍山各有一廠，但是破壞慘重，已經沒有修復的希望，另外葫蘆島有一廠，是日本人聘德籍工程師設計的，現在由資源委員會化學公司經營，設備為每日生產一百噸，尚未出貨，恢復生產，後預計可生產五十噸，上海方面的開誠硫酸公司，到現在也尚未修復。目前負責供應國內工業需要的僅此利中一廠，利中是復活了，中國的製酸業也復活了。</p>

<h3>兩廣水災嚴重　香港籌賑忙碌</h3>
<p>— 香港廿五日航訊　本報特約記者程志政</p>
<p>此次兩廣水災，區域之廣，為百年來所僅見，廣東受災縣份，共四十餘縣，廣西全省九十二縣中，被災者已達五十縣，粵東江之惠陽，被侵區域水高廿八尺，災民在廿萬以上，毀屋數千，人畜死亡，無法統計，其餘如何源，博羅·高要·中山·羅定·　南·清遠·四會·東莞·新豐·南海·三水·龍門·英德·鶴山·花縣·從化·增城·德慶·均受災慘重，收成絕望，桂省雖沒有詳細的災情報道，可是災情之重，也是不言可喻的。</p>
<p>香港人民，自從得到兩粵水災的消息以後，立刻就展開了募欵賑災運動，組織了一個」港九各界籌賑兩廣水災會，」分頭勸募，如火如荼，粵水災急救會並推林翼中·伍智梅·羅冀羣三委員來滬呼籲，同時香港籌賑會也由董華三院主席徐季良氏率領各代表到廣州詳商賑款分配辦法，這幾天，整個的香港，忙於扶死救傷，而募款的成績，已近港幣三十萬元，其中捐募最多的，首推金銀貿易市場，計捐十五萬元，胡文虎先生捐款和贈藥，共計四萬餘元，南洋兄弟煙草公司也獨捐三萬元，華僑日報發起義賣，一天之內，得款一萬餘元，現在酒樓茶室小販等紛紛舉行義賣，戲院劇團舉行義演，全港學生，發起每人募捐五元運動，預計捐款總數，當可達港幣五十萬元。（合國幣約五十萬萬元）</p>
<p>關於散賑問題，各界也曾一度商談，為避免中飽，使災民確能獲得實惠起見，將來或由華商總會，金銀貿易塲組織監賑團，協助省府散賑，香港人民本人溺的精神，熱烈救災，實在是不易多得的。</p>
<h3>瀋陽　機車廠　呼吼聲</h3>
<p>— 瀋陽廿三日航訊　本報特派員　韓清濤</p>
<p>東北在大破壤和毀滅種！在這裏報到一個健在和值得誇耀的「瀋陽機車車輛製造廠」，我們看到它的作用，感到東北的重要，同時也不能再使它遭受破壞和毀滅了。</p>
<p>是一塊接近「北陵」和「塔灣」風景區的地帶，有幾處佔地頗多的廠房，買着烟氣，老遠的就可聽到叮咚響成一片的聲音，那就是「瀋陽機車車輛製造廠」，地點他瀋陽皇姑區。</p>
<p>它是資委會在瀋陽的一個單位，也是瀋陽鐵西和皇姑工業區裏，今天，少數煙囪能冒烟的一個大工廠。</p>
<p>這是一們總廠，裏面包括機車，車輛，鍛鑄，修配等四個廠，另外，在瀋陽還有「鐵西工廠」，「瀋陽汽車工廠」，外埠有兩個廠，一個是「鞍山工廠」，另一個是「安東汽車工廠」。</p>
<p>「資委會瀋陽機車車輛製造有限公司」設在</p>
<p>總廠　裏，總經理是劉史瓚，協理曹　文，公司下設總務，業務，設計，工務，財務等五處，另外就是廠和各廠。</p>
<p>接收了一年的總廠，受着電力和資金缺乏等影饗，工作是不如理想的圓滿，但在全體員工努力下，也有難能的收穫，他們製造出了一百四十七噸大型機車八輛，十五噸小型機車三輛，修造大小機軍十一輛，製造貨車一百六十一輛，并修理客貨車十六輛，完全是中國人自己血汗的結晶。</p>
<p>這些製造和修理的車輛，已經分別供應給「交通部東北運輸總局」，「阜新煤礦」，「北票煤礦」，「烟合煤碳」，「西安煤礦」，「本溪煤鐵公司」，「鞍山鋼鐵公司」，「遼寗水泥公司」，「台灣糖業公司」，使用。</p>
<p>卅六年，全年預定，生產數量是這樣的：製造一四七噸大型機車一十二輛，十五噸小型機車二十輛，貨車六百輛，修理大型機車三十輛，修理貨車二百輛，目前一個大型機車的成本，大約是國幣廿五億元，美國機車約需十二萬至十四萬美元，要以黑市計算，國幣只有一半的價格。</p>
<p>一個大機車的總重量是一百零三四公噸，所需的工數是六千四百五十一個，那裏有捶軋，翻砂，鏃創，電焊，以及一切技衛上的工夫，特約工廠的工數還不在內。</p>
<p>製造大型機車，僅須裝配由國外購進的風閘，鍋爐管，輸圈等配件就可昇火出廠，小機車除了鍋爐管外，全部可在東北製造，因為風閘，鍋爐管，輪圈等，東北目前不完整的工廠裹，已無能為力了。</p>
<p>製造貨車所用</p>
<p>材料　除了木料，棉紗，池漆以外，其餘的像鋼鐵材料，輪軸，掛鈎，彈簧，可鍛鐵，螺絲，鉚釘，風管，軸油，銅，鉛，鋅等直接材料；氧氣，電石焊條，電料，烟煤，焦炭等間接材料；，全由資源委負會牌山鋼鐵公司，瀋陽機器廠，瀋陽化工廠，瀋陽橡膠廠，撫順礦務局，阜新煤礦公司，本溪煤鐵公司，東北金屬礦業公司，瀋陽電工分廠等單位供給，連成一氣，不可分離。</p>
<p>東北一切困難問題的不能解決，都推在了交通身上，鋼鐵會議中，檢討鞍山各種計劃方案，成敗所緊也是在於運輸，運輸困難為車輛不足。瀋陽機車車廠三品：第五號新車（本報特派貝韓清濤審）</p>
<p>民國三十三年，敵偽佔領時代東北織路，共有機車二·三七六輛，貨車四一·七四一輛，一年中貨運達三百卅億噸公里，所運貨物約七千萬噸。</p>
<p>卅六年一月問調查，東北已接收的車輛，六機車六百輛，貨車五·四〇〇輛，這裏邊尚有一·四〇〇輛，是華北鐵路的財產，這些僅有的東西，澤要受到大破壞，我們看到製機機車一棵釘一棵釘進的辛苦，加上－層層刨礦的工人，我們也看到了一個個機車花破壞的橋樑上翻下去，或是轟然一聲，弄成廢鐵的慘痛。</p>
<p>機車輛製造廠，所需主要材料為鞍山的鋼鐵，撫順和阜新的煤，吉林的材料，現在木材多在共軍區域，難以獲得，鋼鐵和煤焦也受到了交通的限制。</p>
<p>此外還有一個</p>
<p>電力　問題，小豐滿的電路被切斷了，每天除了由電力局東拼西湊供給些電力外，廠方又利用機車為原動力，發電四百萬瓦，但距得到整個問題解決尙遠。</p>
<p>必須向國外購送的重要材料，已經由各政院核准美金四十萬元，在國外訂購陸續可到。</p>
<p>公司五年擴充計劃，已由資委會轉呈最高經濟委員會，如果再把大連廠（製造小機車）接收過來，那麼五年後可達到每年產機車二百輛，客車二百翻以及貨車四千輛的數目字。</p>
<p>機車車輛廠的歷史紀錄是這樣的：當民國廿七年日軍閥大陸政策湧進東北，有「根深蒂固」的趨勢了，日人「秋山正八」和「滿鐵」先後集資三千萬日元，創設」滿洲車輛株式會社」，廿八年五月開工，從事製造機車，客車，貨車。</p>
<p>民國三十一年，製造貨車五九九輛，卅三年製造機車四十一輛，據說是受到了戰時人工和材料的影饗，在理論上這僅達到生產的半數。</p>
<p>東北光復，蘇軍到達瀋陽佔管該廠，不知為了什麼，把我們的工人遺散了，由着日蘇兩方面員工，維持修車工作。</p>
<p>蘇軍撒退，未及從容拆遷，僅得搬走重要機器七十五台，如此雖然元氣大傷，但還能有所作為　。</p>
<p>卅五年三月末，國軍進駐瀋陽，由着有關部門</p>
<p>接收　了該廠，五月間定名為「經濟部機車車輛製造廠」遺走日人，招補我們的工人，六月初，得到一百蒸瓦的電力，於是開了工，到了九月底，第一部機車出廠，同時並造成貨車一十五輛，並修造了兩部舊機車。</p>
<p>十月一日，改稱今名，按照計劃，從事生產，到了六月十九日，是他們復工一週年了。</p>
<p>東北的工業是整個的，交通上車輛的製造，更是所有工業中重要的</p>
<p>一環　我們要充分發揮，它的威力，要謀整個東北工業的配合。環環相緊，不能鬆懈。</p>
<p>東北的重要性，第一是輕重工業的建樹，現在雖然殘破不全了，但在低落的生產量和設備上，還是洋洋大觀，為國內所少有，鋼鐵，礦產，工廠，都建立了良好規模，打下了根基。</p>
<p>今天，是在逐步設法恢復舊觀方面下工夫，但，唯一的條件是安定和建設，不然的話，那就一切都完了，拿事實來說明，這次東北共軍發動第五次攻勢，戰火蔓延，僅各地「中紡公司﹂，損失法幣就在萬億元以上。</p>
<p>戰火焚毀了東北工礦生產事業，據財部東北特派員陳公亮說：「東北稅收，原以各地工廠礦山產品貨物稅為大宗，但因電源斷絕，撫順煤碳淡量減少，各地工廠泰半停工，稅收大減，時局再不好轉，稅收前途相當黯淡」，又是一個報告多麼沉痛的。</p>
<p>在恢復中的東北工礦，中途不能稍有停頓，更不能稍有破壤，否則不但前功盡棄，或者充無恢復希望了。</p>
<p>聽到機車車輛廠，出廠械車的吼聲，令人興奮，也使人感慨萬端！</p>

<h3>編校絮語</h3>
<p>— 王進珊</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>今天在這兒，我得為本刋先向文學藝術界的朋友們表示個人的感謝和歉意。就便和愛護本刋的讀者說幾句話。</p>
<p>我和本刋的編校工作發生關係，到今天巳經整斃的十個月了，時間雖不太長，也編了二百九十多期。假如我是一個女人，在接編的那天受孕的話，今天至少也該有一個嬰兒呱呱墜地。可是，在今天我以什麼來答謝朋友們和讀者的期望呢？老實說，去年我剛從後方回來，又値復員期間，與文藝界早已失却聯繫，就連本刋的性質也有點模糊，所以在那四個月之中，只是摸索。而今年的六個月呢，雖說內政已走上憲政的初階，不過戰禍未已，國事　婦，民生維艱，文藝界正遭逢着厄運的時代，恐怕就連讀者的訂報，已經是一份相當的負擔。</p>
<p>本刋過去雖然也曾隨時徵詢作家和讀者的意見，期望能朝着大家的理想做去，也獲得很多熱忱愛護本刋的人士的指示和支持。有一部分雖已勉力辦到，不過限於編者的精力和才能，未能將實貴的指示充分實現，也沒有把積極的支持儘量發揮。甚至於友朋的信件也不能隨時作答，很好的文稿當不免無端擱置。這也是在今天，半個年度終了的時候，値得從新檢討，要說幾句廢話的理由。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>最初因為聘約的關係，我還在南京某大學敎幾點鐘書，直到今年春天——其實我們過夜生活的人，是不大知道春夏秋冬的。有幾次我去車站，看到旅客漸漸多起來，而且雙雙對對的都穿上了春裝，一股無事忙的勁兒，才恍然於春天的到臨，而我的車票使更加難買了。不得已，就只好託朋友代課。</p>
<p>這時我想，以後或許可以抽出一部分時間來，畫畫畫，寫寫稿子；誰知道時間完全不是理想的那麽從容，空下來會有更多的瑣事與煩攪；即就整理來稿而言，儘多的時間都可以加上去。我以前雖沒有長期做過職業的編輯人，可是業餘的編輯工作，也斷斷續續的做了十多年。而自已因為也常寫寫塗塗，懂得寫文章的甘苦；於是更有一份愛護別人作品的痴心，總不肯把別人的心」隨便糟塌。一篇文章決定用了，又少不得從標題，段落，語句，字眼，以及俗字，草書，筆誤之類，連帶標點符號整理一番。然後再計劃編排的格式，版面上的地位等等；而我舞的版面又不是固定的。今天發排的，不但得顧到前後幾天刊載的體裁，以免雷同；就是同日登載的也需注意着互相間的配搭。在變化之間要求它的統一，在駁雜之中須保持着諧和。這其間所費的精力遠不是作家和讀者所能想像。於是不免使我常常想起哥德的話來，而增添無限惆悵。他當一八二四年回憶當年與釋勒合編刋物時的情境，曾勸導友人勿當編輯，他說：</p>
<p>「我和釋勒編了「時神」和「年刊詩集」不知耗費了多少時間；近來我翻閱了我們的書信，什麽都明白了。每次回想那個企圖，總是心裏懊惱。……」</p>
<p>十年前，王統照編「文學」的時候，也曾談到編輯工作的困難，說：</p>
<p>「論來應分豐瞻的學識，鑒別文章的本事，更需要精心與耐力，這並不够，還得附帶上應付環境的才能。」</p>
<p>的確，聰明人在這年頭早已升官發財，編輯工作也決不是聰明人做的事。在編輯者個人，尤其有寫作習慣的人，至少是一種精力的浪費。不過話要說回來，大家都做了總明人，世界上再沒有　子，米反映總明人之聰明，那也是够單調的。</p>
<p>當我每次為瑣碎的事務，和生活的奔忙，壓得透不過氣來的時候，雖然也有慶護我的朋友勸我不必太認眞；但是我却相信一個獻身文藝事業的人又怎能够糊塗得起來呢？</p>
<p>當然也有許多高明的編輯先生，具備着天縱之聖的才能，是不層顧慮及此的。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>每當黃昏，街燈冷落，有時還不免雨雪霏霏。我獨自從寓所挾着一捲文稿，——因為不習慣於用公事包，在今年三月以前，還常用一張牛皮紙包裹着。有一天被一位關心我的朋友，也是本刋的讀者發現了，便將在大學讀書用過幾次的一隻精　而堅固的請義夾式的皮包，贈送給我，這麼我才有了一件比較合用的工其。深宵將每天收到的文稿裝着換回家，第二天黃昏又將選編過的文稿裝着挾出來。走一段路，趕上電車，或呌一輛三輪。</p>
<p>這時我總不免常想着，文藝雖然感情的敎育，人類靈魂的歷史。而這種事業與別人　能有一點益處嗎？這混沌的時代是不是這需要這樣一份比較淸新的精神食糧呢？文藝的目的除了給讀者欣賞喜悅而外，眞個還能使人們知道一點社會人生的眞諦嗎？讀報的人從新聞電訊方面了解了這一代的社會行動，可以從副刋方面，再了解一些這一代的人的靈魂的光彩呢？——本刊在讀者心裏究竟激起怎樣的反映？</p>
<p>雖然看着沿途的樹木的枝葉由凋零而又暢茂，挾着的裝載文稿的皮包每晚都隨着我聽任着霜侵露潤，風吹雨霖，也漸漸顯得有些表老而快要破舊了。我撫摩着它不禁沉入思索的深淵；我茫然了、也正如街燈一樣，茫然的虛縣在寂靜的街頭。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>有許多很使我感動的事，想着又像是無數有力的鞭子在鞭策着我；尤是朋友們的鼓勵與誇獎。</p>
<p>我親聽到好幾位中學生告訴我，他們的國文老師在課堂上公開的介紹本刋，作為學生的課外讀物；偶然也選印過本刊登載的文章，作為國文敎材。又如某校學生壁報，也常將本刋的短稿，抄錄轉載。至於讀者選幾篇文章或挿圖隨時剪留粘貼，或是整張保存的，聽說也很多；我也常接到要求查前副刋的來信。還有幾位讀者來信，他要求將本報副刋左邊的白紙留寬一些，好讓他裝訂。當然也有人建議過輯印單行本。可是這些事在這時都不是很容易辦到的。</p>
<p>我除常常想到就以本報日銷十五萬份計，每份有五位至十位讀者，那麼每天就有七十五萬以上的讀者，假如登了一篇空虛或歡弱的文稿，或是印錯了一個字，就將受到七十五萬以上的讀者的責備。因此更使人感到戰戰兢兢。</p>
<p>當然，在報館方面從編輯部到排字房，每一部分的同事都經常給我很多的指導與協助。要說明的，本刋距離理想的水準還遠，顯然是努力的不够、這種歉仄，時刻在我心裏迴旋，這種職責，我也不庸諉卸。但是不能不把這些情形坦白的告訴作家和讀者。而希望來稿在消極方面都能顧到編者的困難，在積極方面都能帮助本刋充實內容，提高水準。更期望確定的把握着本刊的文藝的性質，已有的　永的情調和嚴肅的風格。大家來共同墾殖，耕耘，灌溉，使朝夕受着風雨侵襲文藝園地，還能常開着一朶美麗的奇葩。－這是大家的理想。</p>
<p>在本刊性質方面，今天不想多說，總之，文學藝術部門的創作譒譯，以及研究報導，和有時間意義的文藝紀念文字，一律歡迎。而最近所需要的，則是三千字以內的短篇小說，一兩千字的文藝理論，千字上下的小品和雜文，以及不滿百字的文藝短稿之類。其餘則早有徵稿簡則列布，不再詳及。</p>
<p>所謂雋永，只是一種文章的情味，活潑如流水，晶瑩如實石，淡雅如窗外遠山，遒勁如峯頂老松，而又近情近理，親切有味。這種文章可以令人讀了還要想想，想想還要再讀。從反面說，就是不要枝節繁冗，不要生硬粗陋，也不要遠離現實人生。希臘批評家戴奧尼索斯批評柏拉圖的文調說，</p>
<p>「他的文調可以處處看出是光明透亮，好像是澄淸的泉水一般，並且特別確切美妙。他只月平常的字，務求明白，不加雕飾。他的古典文字古色古香，顯着一種歡暢的神韻，美而有力，好像一陣和風從芬芳的草茵上吹過來的一般……」</p>
<p>我也常想，無論什麽內容，不拘何種體裁的文字，縱然不是文藝作品，也應該給予讀者一種文字的美感；何况刊載在文藝刋物上的文章呢？</p>
<p>嚴肅的意思，在這兒只是就主題的選擇，取材的眼光與寫作的能度而言，這並不是道學光生拉長了面孔裝出來的，而相反的，所謂『人情之所不能已者聖人弗禁』；然而滿紙風花雪月，一派傷春悲秋，也不見得就能成為文藝作品。作品是用眞實的話來表現人生的，自然要富有人情味。如能把文章本身當做一件藝術品，寫作時際就得像創造藝術品一樣，不姑息自己的功力，修改刪削；在初稿寫成後都具有同樣重要的價値。我可以不客氣的說，我常大胆的潤飾過許多來稿，然後發排。也常接到許多來信，要求修改文稿，可惜限於時間我都沒有做得很好，這也是非常抱歉的一件事。－於此只有誠懇的布望寫作歷史悠久的作家常常賜撰佳作，以資示範。</p>
<p>在這各校暑假開始，長夏將臨的時候，大家生活或許比較可以輕鬆一點。因此更願各大中學文學敎師，文學院的同學以及文藝界的朋友們多多的給予本刋以豐當的指導與協助，多寫幾篇堅實而優美的文章寄給本刋：編者謹以熱切的心情，在這兒期待着！</p>
<h3>天國的琴聲</h3>
<p>— 羅賽諦</p>
<p>羅賽諦（D．G．Ｒossetti1828-1882）本是意大利人，因為他生長在英國，所以很多史家把他的畫歸納在英國畫派中。</p>
<p>他不但繪畫的天才高，而且還有文學的修養，能做詩，能寫秀麗的文章。他是辣斐耳前派的領導者。</p>
<p>作品的特點是富于瞑想，幻覺，浪漫和文學的意味。代表作有「但丁的夢」，「白晝的夢」，「天國的琴聲」等。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>貝多芬與「力」</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>在震撼人們心靈的幾側偉大音樂家中，較之莫札特，巴哈，蕭邦等等，我更偏愛貝多芬。這不僅是由於他的雄邁的力（羅曼羅蘭說他是『力的化身」）而是由於他的崇商和孤傲的人品。傳雷先生在「貝多芬的作品及其精神」個文裏說得好：</p>
<p>「要肯定這個「我」，在帝王與貴族之前解放個人，使他們　認個個人都是帝王貴族，或個例帝王貴族都是平民，就須光肯定「力」，把它裁培，扶養，提出，具體表現，使人不得不接受。每個自由的「我」要指揮。倘他不能在行動上，至少能在藝術上指揮。倘使不能征服王國像拿破侖，至少也得要征服心靈和情操，像貝多芬。是的，貝多芬與力，這是個天生就的題目。』（貝多芬傳頁一一〇）</p>
<p>貝多芬的不少曲子，是他的力的發洩，力的宣言，他有他的口頭　：『力是那般與尋常人不同的人底道德，它便是我底道德。』可是雖然如此，他並未陷入尼采式底超人主義的泥坑。尼采式的「力」底表現，是想自拔頭髮以飛昇，脫離庸衆，翱翔自如；貝多芬則不然，他運用了他的天賦，敎人類對苦難，命運，應當用『力』去反抗和征服；對自己的兄弟，應當用「力」去鼓勵，去熱烈的愛。他在『彌撤祭樂』中，代卑微的人類呼籲，為受難者歌唱；在『第九交禹樂』裏，又想從痛苦與鬥爭中解放了人，擴大了人。這樣——</p>
<p>「解放與擴大的結果，人與神明迫近，與神明合一，那時，力就是神，人就是力，無所謂善惡，無所謂衝突，力的兩極性消滅了。』（見貝多芬傳）</p>
<p>這個『力』的崇敬者，其實有更高於「力」的心靈在拉制着他自己，那就是他的人品。他聾了，於是與不朽的『永恒』為伴；他的崎　的一生，不足以證實他的生涯的悲慘，却反而顯示了這世界的不合理。他的一生中無時無刻不在和庸俗戰鬥，生理上，境遇中，心靈裏，……同時在幾條戰綫上揮戈，然而他絕未敗北，不，就是在這樣的戰鬥中，他也無時無刻不在向可憐的人類吹噓勇氣。他的每一曲歌，都可以當作『力的宣言』看。他曾寫信給他的姪子說：『我們的時代』需要有力的心靈把這些可憐的人羣加以鞭斥」。請不要以為這是他的狂妄；正因為他的一雙慧眼看透了人間的稱種卑劣陰險的塲面，正因為他全身洋溢着戰鬥氣息，所以他才會以聖者的雄心說了這樣的話。</p>
<p>在致鋼琴家邱吉的信裏，他說：</p>
<p>「當你的學生在琴上指法適當、節拍準確，彈奏音符也相當合拍時，你只須留心風格，勿在小錯失上去阻斷他，而只等一曲終了時告訴他。——這個方法可以養成「音樂家」，而這是音樂藝術底第一個</p>
<p>技巧的調練是一事，心靈的拉養是又一事，兩者中貝多芬較注重後者。請看在上面這封信中所提及的「音樂家」、貝多芬為什麽如此加重口氣呢？——他的意思不是等于說：是音樂家啊！決非音樂匠！</p>
<h3>百年在計——對美術館籌備處的希望</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>中國之繪畫，盛於唐，極於宋，變於元，分化於明，蕭條於淸·大有每下愈况，一代不如一代氣象，至於近百年來，　壇哀頒紛亂，早為有識之士，所搖頭嘆息；加以西畫輸人，內憂外患，更紛至沓來，　道乃益以不振。今上海市美術館籌設之初，擬先舉行近百年畫展，以為提倡研究之初步，　次向上、如倒吃甘蔗，漸入佳境，使觀者怵於近代畫壇之衰弱。緬懷唐宋絢爛輝煌之業　，起衰振敝，努力作文藝之復與運動，甚盛事也。</p>
<p>治病必先考病源，現代繪畫之病象叢生，其中病之根源遠者在淸初，近者在淸末，要想明瞭現代繪畫之所以如此，實不可不把近百年來之繪畫作一總檢討，究其病根所在，以作亡羊補牢之計，對證下藥，方不致有藥石誤投之危險。</p>
<p>十室之邑，必有忠信；百年之中，豈無俊秀？茍能搜羅宏富，加以比較，則瑕瑜可見，玉石自分，更或有傑出之作，向為人所忽視，一旦發現，必驚創獲。</p>
<p>近百年繪畫實為現代繪畫之父，父雖未能克紹箕裘，發掛光大，但其承先啓後之功功亦不可沒滅，而時代限人，環境限人，雖有奇才異能，率不能超出時代，打破環境，使吾人早生七八十年、恐亦不過吸四王之餘波，其所成就，未必能超陸廉夫而上之。如與任同時，恐未必不受其影響，作海派之信徒。盛極必衰，天然公例，丁茲末運，雖有大力、莫之能挽，遽加輕視，一筆抹煞，亦非情理之平。吾輩不薄古人愛今人，無古人固無今人，無今人又何以繼古人哉！</p>
<p>吾所　於美術州館籌備處者，不僅舉行各時代之展豐會而巳，甚望政府當局撥有充足之經費購藏歷代傑作，經常陳列，雖不能如法英義等國。博物院書廊之完備，最少亦須與北平故宮博物院南北抗衡，作為中國美術之總匯，百年大計，此其濫觴耳。</p>
<h3>對月懷亡友滕若渠</h3>
<p>— 俞新吾</p>
<p>情多損年少，况復如君才，世路嗟搖落，（若渠在雲南，意常不悅，曾賦搖落一首寄錢賓西。）文章　別裁，綺羅零昔夢，琴瑟撫遣哀（君與夫人不協）夜色今宵好，故人安在哉？</p>
<h3>年壽有時竟</h3>
<p>— 俞新吾</p>
<p>年詩有時竟，天地有窮時；惟此靈虛際，邈忽不容　；縣　萬占世，細巨悉為糜；六合本寥廓，至此竟支離；哀哉空王子，絕滅以為期。</p>
<h3>夏日</h3>

<p>濃烈一陽光，潑落在大地上，大地在日光下面嘆息海洋風挾帶着暑意，一陣陣吹向這煩囂的都市裏來，這都市的騷動比以前更急促了。眼看那人車的交流，灰塵的飛，我不期然地有一股窒息與疲憊的感覺湧上心頭。</p>
<p>夏天，一個酷熱的季節，它所帶給都市人的，是為生活所流的汗液，疫病的侵擾，熟與光的威脅……</p>
<p>我躑躅在夏日的街頭，駄着一襲烈陽麻木而機械地踽踽前行，「往那裏云？」我的回答是走向生活的屠宰塲去，去換取一份口糧；在緘默中我意味着這盛暑的季節，原是少不掉有納悶和喘息的。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>都市的夏，有着極不協調的書面，它伸展在人與人之間，像一條深深的鴻溝，如果你是這個都市的觀光者的話，你便可以看到窮人們在廉價地流汗，在死亡饑餓的邊緣討生活，而富家子女們却安適地逗留在冷氣設備的餐　裏，酣歌甜舞。</p>
<p>熟天，對窮人是一重威脅，對於有錢的人却有着一種建築在金錢上的嫵媚的情調。</p>
<p>有人把盛夏此作一個殘酷的暴君，它統治着大地上的生物，用它的張烈的光，把蟻民們蒸餾得焦頭爛額，當人們嗅到他的脚步聲的時候，誰個不從心地裏咒咀它吶！</p>
<p>迎着炙熱的火，荒凉的風沙，拖着一具乾　的皮囊來打發着這個沉悶的日子，我，絕望地跌入了噩夢裏了，夢見沙漠似的世界，夢見太喝神的凶暴的臉，夢見他潑下了迫人的暑氣。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>於是懦怯的詩人在戰慄，無恥者在歌頌、小丑們躱在凉亭裏躱避，大地也就陷入了死的沉默</p>
<p>眼望這漫漫的長夜、我覺得我的幻夢是無力的？</p>
<h3>盾</h3>
<p>— 中直</p>
<p>在博物館裏，看見了一面盾</p>
<p>盾，引起我深思，……</p>
<p>透過這面盾，我看見了古代的英雄。－一手握長矛兮一手執盾，穿千軍，過萬馬，所向披靡。</p>
<p>透過這面盾，我看見了古代的戰爭，－將軍騎在戰馬上，士兵拿着弩箭，盲目的亂射一陣。兩位將軍會見了，鼓聲不絕，二馬相交，矛與盾，刀與槍，混成一大片。……</p>
<p>撫摸。一下吧，這個曾經滄桑的盾！</p>
<p>突然，我覺到，……</p>
<p>為什麽要用盾呢？為什麽不回射我者一箭？為什麼不回刺我者一槍？却用盾去擋一擋？</p>
<p>眞英雄是不用盾的。用盾的不是眞英雄。</p>
<p>眞英雄要用箭去射死射我者不眞英雄要用槍去刺死刺我者·</p>
<p>盾，是懦夫的武器。是弱者的鮑殼、是愚人的護身衛，</p>
<p>眞英雄是不用盾的；用盾的。是眞英雄。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>我以為一個人外形最靜止的時候，往往是他心靈最紛擾的時候。因為當某一方面的情感不得宣洩，只好故作平靜，用以安定自身。也就是回返到自己的世界－同憶裏去躲藏。</p>
<p>我又認為，每個人所亨受到的人生，其總和是不會相差太遠的，不過各個人對於他各自的所取的百分比之不同而已。</p>
<p>這種取捨輕重的不同，便可用以說明每個人底人生價値的不同。</p>
<p>如果現世界所存在的每一種能，都能由遞次發現，並能充分的予以作有利的運用。那末，眞是太理想了。</p>
<p>物的進步實在是太快了。精神文明的繩索扣不緊、甚至拉不住原子的世界。我價躭心由於某一人的一念之差，毀滅了人類的滋榮。</p>
<p>老子說：「知常日明」。「常」可以解釋為「自然」。換言之，老子的意思是說：「瞭解自然的便是明」。而所謂　解，當然是指懂得運用自然之力的。</p>
<p>最可惜的，可以說是力的消耗了·</p>
<p>L說：「大凡兩種力在衝突了的時候，是會停滯的；正如游藝塲門口的相擠，勢必誰也過不去。」</p>
<p>我由此不由得掀起一連串對於現實的聯想了。</p>
<p>或者可以這樣樣釋吧！那游藝塲的門是窄的。可是能多用理智，棄除自私，在秩序井然的情况下，每個人都可以走進那扇門。</p>
<p>然而，自私把我們坑了。</p>

<h3>阮籍二三事——魏晋人物雜論之二</h3>
<p>— 周冷</p>
<p>在明哲保身之點上，阮籍似乎比嵇康勝過一籌。這不是以一個坐誅，一個能保終年，甩成敗得失來看古人。我是說嵇康在佯狂中祗能做到含垢匿瑕，口不言人過的消極防守，‘而阮籍却能進一步，寓諷刺於任誕，攻擊權貴的隱痛，而又能見機收歛，不給別人以口柄。</p>
<p>晋書四十九阮籍傳：</p>
<p>「籍本有濟世志，以魏晋之際，天下多故，名士少有全也，籍用是不與世事，遂酣飲為常。文帝初欲為武帝求婚於籍，籍醉六十日，不得言而止，鍾會數以時事問之，欲因其可否而致之罪，皆以酣醉獲免」。</p>
<p>處在這樣惡劣環境，怯者要不是投降過去早就嚇得噤不敢言的，然而不，阮籍不但毫不害怕，我行我素，用白眼來月旦禮俗之士，而且還寫出一篇大人先生傳，着實地把這些大人先生們挖苦一番：</p>
<p>「世之所謂君子，惟法是條，惟禮是克，手執圭　，足履繩墨，少稱鄕黨，長聞鄰國，上欲圖三公，下不失九州牧，獨不見羣蝨之處褌中，逃乎深縫，匿乎壞絮，自以為吉宅也，行不敢離縫際，動不敢出褌襠，自以為繩墨也，然炎丘火流，焦邑滅都，羣蠢處於褌中，而不得出也。君子之處域內，何異夫蝨之處褌中乎」？</p>
<p>用蠢子來形容大人先生，雖然有點不倫不類，但他所指示大人先生們的缺點，死硬的維持現狀，盲目的尊重法統，不論對與不對，無條件的加以擁護，而認為改革進取為大逆不道，不思振作，也振作不來，這，即使拿來比方今天的學者名流，也未嘗不是十分恰當的。</p>
<p>阮籍不滿現實的思想不但見於這段文字，而且他那迭次的窮途痛哭的行徑，照我看也有所感而發，並不單止是任誕神經的。因為凡抱大才而不能伸展的人，不是流於唐頹便流於偏激。所以他寫過一首歌：「日沒不周西，月出丹淵中，陽精蔽不見，陰光代為雄，亭止在須臾，厭厭將復隆，富貴俯仰間，貧賤何必終」。意識出來：「太陽下山了，月亮出來了，光明不見了，黑暗瀰漫着，但這是一時間的事，不久就會恢復原狀的，到那時候，我就可以大展懷抱了，再不會懷才不遇。」你看，是多麽一篇悲憤積極的詩歌！</p>
<p>晋志：「籍嘗登廣武，觀楚漢戰處，歎曰：時無英雄，使豎子得名。登武牢山，望京邑而嘆、於是賦豪傑詩。」一方面旣是酣醉酲酒，一方面又賦豪傑詩，則心中懷抱，牢騷夾雜着沉鬱，旣要避開權臣的陷害，又恐怕自己無聞而終。世間上最矛盾最痛苦的事，恐怕莫過此也！</p>

<h3>蒼閔的藝人——爲紀念劉寳全作</h3>
<p>— 司空無忌</p>
<p>寳全之子從「上流人」的敎育，學會了躦營，學優改仕，做官是最好的生意。寳全之子得發了。</p>
<p>「你在外面出頭拋而的，成什麽樣子，明天別再幹下去了！」這是做官的兒子對唱大鼓的父親，所發的命令辭。此　今人所謂的階級服從歟</p>
<p>寳全接受了兒子的話，「是呀，也該替兒子留個臉呀。也該享幾年福呀。」實全。全然沒有計較兒子的語氣，他私自暗忖蕭。　實全回到了兒子的公館裏，兒子的公館裘增多了一名老傭人；渾號呌老太爺的。</p>
<p>「以後不准吸鴉片了！」</p>
<p>『你怎麽這樣懶？」</p>
<p>全是命令與磨折。</p>
<p>那正是實全五十多歲的年紀。一切希望全破了。他終於脫離了公館，重返鼓壇。</p>
<p>這一次巨大的刺激，增加了他對於人世的悲戚，鼓點起處，他陪着他的故事，忽喜忽怒，把自然的情感，豐富了鼓辭的生命。他給人們多少哀樂……雖然，講的左右不過是些前朝的節烈，忠臣孝子……可是，這其中，又蘊伏着若干無法計算的血淚</p>
<p>寳全的身體本來不大好，加以上了年紀。然而，為了生活，他只有强自掙扎着。舊的希望跟着那個實貝兒子走了。　突然有一天，天津劉大公館主人的生日做堂會，派人到北京來　角。少不了請了這位鼓王去。在重酬之下，寳全到了天津。堂會那天，眞是車水馬龍。寳全在台上侍候了一段亨武關。博得全塲的掌聲，主人放　，寳全叩頭謝謝主人的恩賜。起立時抬頭一看，原來昂然上坐的劉大爺就是他的令郎。</p>
<p>這白頭髮的藝人倒下了，噴了一口血，昏厥在地上。</p>
<p>窮人是不應該病的。病使窮人更窮了。寳全回到北京的生活更是苦不堪言。而他內心的寂寞，更有甚於他生活的痛苦。他不能忍受飢餓，更不能忍受寂寞。</p>
<p>——他，這位銀髮蟠然，而容淸擁的老藝人，又重新步上了鼓壇。</p>
<p>幾十年的功力，天才加上錘鍊，還有，更主要的蒼凉的身世和滿腔的家國之愛。全都貫注於寳全每一個字音，每一個身段眞</p>
<p>聽衆們的心靈全都被那蒼凉的高尢而有時略帶　啞的　　懾去了。</p>
<p>鼓點停了，檀板之聲無色。這白髮藝人如魯殿靈光似搖幌了一下他的頭，緩緩地低俯着身子，算是行了一個禮，從容地放下了鼓錘。夢醒了，聽衆們强睜着眼看了看空虛了的　壇。又彼此間望了一望，笑了；感傷然而又是愉快地笑了。接着彼此相擠着，鬧囂囂地擠出那　　院的窄門</p>
<p>那位白髮的鼓下呢？在後合吮着茶，咳着嗽。然後，拖着蹣跚的步子，回到他的破屋裏去。</p>
<p>抗戰發生了。這位當年號稱小寳全的已臨遲暮之境的鼓王的身體更孱弱了。在敵偽獸氛下的　京，載王還是竭　他最後的聲音，搖講着前朝忠孝節烈的故事。</p>
<p>像一個成熟的果子辭別樹枝　這位藝人——不，稱他爲宗匠更恰當些吧！我不知道他離開這世界時，是很安詳地呢？還是很蒼凉的呢？</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>這故事是一位已故的老伶工告訴我的。我沒有敢加上任何渲染。</p>
<p>我之所以寫下這篇小文，全是表示我個人對於這位藝術宗匠的無可比擬的崇敬而已。（下）</p>

<h3>夢的科學（一）</h3>
<p>— 顧均正</p>
<p>每一個人都做夢，有些人自以爲不做夢，其實是由於隨做忘之故。對於夢，自來有種迷信，但是下面所說的，却是科學家經長期的研究而得到的結論。</p>
<p>夢是怎樣來的？</p>
<p>我們的心可以分為內外兩部分，外面的一部分是意識的，裏面的一部分是下意識的。我們的　望，恐懼，挫折與願望，都深藏在下意識之中。當你做夢的時候，內外兩種意識間的障礙物是鬆懈了，於是你的意識的心得以窺見你下意識的心中所進行着事情，這就是夢。</p>
<p>這是因人而異的。有時候略有不同，有時候截然不同。假使你夢裏的人格跟醒着的時候　乎不大有什麽區別，這就表示你的心理非常健康。人格毫無缺陷。然而假使你在夢裏　跟醒着的時候判若兩人，那就表示你有神經病的頃向。</p>
<p>夢有幾種型式？</p>
<p>英國著名心裏學家格累恒，霍惠博士（Dr．E．Grahant　Howe）發現一切的夢都可以歸入下列各類：</p>
<p>（一）滿足慾望之夢，例如小孩夢見華涎的玩具，大人夢得錢財，或夢見自已所不喜歡的人的死。</p>
<p>（二）渴望之夢，例如夢者趁不着火車，爬無底的深坑等這個型式的夢，表示　　某種企羅的失敗。</p>
<p>（三）有目的之夢，這種夢在解法某一問題，或懸擬某一行動的步驟。</p>
<p>（四）自我批判之夢，這種夢　徵夢者自身的紙點。</p>
<p>（五）再現之夢，在這種夢裏，夢者重演日間的經騐。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐圖</p>
<p>競選縂統怪狀百出</p>
<p>當羅斯福競選第四屆聯任總統時，和羅斯福勢均力敵的是紐約省長杜威，民主黨和共和黨擁有數量相等的黨員，他舞的黨員雖然遍於全美，但有若干省完全是民主黨的勢力，有若干省完全是共和黨的勢力，在他們勢力範圍以內的報紙，完全一鼻孔出氣，專事攻擊敵黨、攻訐陰私，甚至涉及私德，有幾家杜威手下所辦報紙，把整個篇幅用下宣佈羅斯福的罪狀，羅列苛捐雜稅有百數十種之多，他們把慈善捐也列為苛捐雜稅，誠所謂欲加之罪不患無詞。羅斯福辦了一個付麽萬元會的秘密組織，就是凡加人為會員的需繳納會費一萬元，競選成功則有福共享。美國的黨派旣不明文規定徵收黨費，這一萬元的入會費是少不了的，而且化一萬元美金的入會費，把首領捧上了合，會員都得佔據要津，或為部會長，或為省市長，區區孝敬萬元，並不過分。羅斯福一派比較大方，並不專事攻計杜威，羅斯福也始終不曾作競選演說。杜載明徐天天演說外，還把照片在報上，另外發出無數「選杜威」的圖像別針。我不是美國人，根本沒有選舉權，承蒙杜咸的黨人送我一只別針，哀懇我別在軍裝上擺擺樣，結果我別了羅斯福的圖像別針，在大選前數日，羅斯福的大少爺伊利諾，羅斯福上校因為空運愛犬，被一個士兵控告，杜威抓住機會，把羅斯福攻擊得體無完處，羅大少爺的新夫人是好萊塢的電影明星，私生活雖免浪漫，也受了池魚之殃，韻事遍傳，報紙騰載，結果羅斯福仍然勝利，杜咸偸鷄不着　把米。據說他下次預備和馬歇爾及愛森　華一爭短長。（六）</p>

<h3>The Entire Length of the Jichang Railway is Open; Forces Can Join Up in the Siping Area; Communist Forces in Western Liaoning Are Defeated and Turn to Attack Beipiao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] The Jichang Railway, which had been cut off by Communist forces for several days, was fully opened on the 29th. The Communist forces entrenched in Huapichang and Hewanzi, two locations on the eastern section of the railway, were successively defeated on this day by National forces advancing from Jilin and Jiutai, respectively. The National forces from the east and west officially joined forces near Hewanzi Station that afternoon. The Jichang Railway was severed on the 15th of this month. Currently, transportation authorities, together with the military, have begun to urgently repair the destroyed railway tracks, bridges, telephone poles and wires, and the Xiaofengman power transmission lines along the route. The resumption of traffic on the Jichang Railway is expected soon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th] The National forces on the southern route recaptured Mengniushao, one station south of Siping, on the afternoon of the 29th. It is estimated that they will be able to join up with the Siping garrison by the morning of the 30th. The National forces on the northern route, after crossing the Dongliao River, have captured Guojia Township and are continuing to advance. That location was a relatively strong stronghold for the Communist forces resisting the National forces coming from the north. After the National forces broke through this point, they will be able to complete the mission of encircling Siping. The two armies in Siping are facing each other from east to west. Over the past 24 hours, they have continued to engage each other, but the situation has not changed significantly. They are urgently awaiting relief.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] According to a telephone call from Siping at 5:00 PM, the day's fighting was quiet. The military and civilians throughout the city enthusiastically built fortifications. At 2:30 PM, during a break, a burst of artillery fire suddenly came from the south of the city, followed by smaller bursts. Shortly after, the command headquarters confirmed that the artillery fire came from the reinforcements arriving from the south. The military and civilians throughout the city were overjoyed upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] According to Changtu telephone, the National forces are currently divided into sixteen routes, advancing towards Siping overnight under the moonlight. They should be able to join forces by dawn on the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 29th] The Siping battle, which had been quiet for 24 hours, became tense again last night. Starting at 9:00 PM, the Communist forces fired dense artillery fire at the defenders' positions. The artillery fire rumbled all night, and infantry charges were repelled by the defenders. It is widely believed that this is the last gasp before the Communist forces collapse. In addition, the Communist forces are launching a counterattack on the line south of Siping, fiercely resisting the National forces advancing north. Fierce battles are currently underway on the Shuangmiaotzu and Henggou Township line. The vanguard of the National forces, which had advanced to the southwest of Siping, is retreating westward south of Bamiancheng.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th] The Communist forces in western Liaoning failed to capture Chaoyang and are now moving troops eastward towards Beipiao, with a force of about ten thousand. They have now occupied Jinlingsi, the connecting point of the Miancheng Line to Beipiao, and have begun to besiege Beipiao. Beipiao has a large power plant that supplies electricity to the Fuxin coal mine and the Yixian and Jinxi areas. Fuxin produces 5,000 tons of coal per day, and there are currently 110,000 tons of coal waiting to be transported. Beipiao, on the other hand, has a smaller coal production volume.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 29th] After suffering a defeat in Chaoyang, the Communist forces regrouped their troops and invaded Beipiao on the 28th, engaging in fierce battles with the local garrison. All of the railway bridges between Jinlingsi and Yixian were destroyed, and much of the railway was also dismantled. The National forces have dispatched troops from Jin County and Chaoyang along two routes to urgently provide reinforcements. In addition, the Communist forces that invaded Pingquan were completely defeated by the garrison on the 28th, and the remnants fled in disarray along their original route.</p>
<h3>The US Revokes the Arms Embargo on China; Has Significant Political Significance; The Truman Doctrine Begins to Apply to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] A senior official of the National Government privately met with a reporter from our agency today, believing that the United States' permission for China to purchase military supplies from the US is equivalent to applying the Truman Doctrine to China, and has significant political significance. He said: "Until now, US aid to China has been primarily economic aid focused on post-war recovery. The revocation of the arms embargo is an action taken after previously avoiding political involvement. It can be seen as the beginning of the application of the Truman Doctrine to China, and as an indication that the policy of halting arms aid to China, adopted during Marshall's mediation of the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists last year, has changed after a shift in the global situation. Asia is a greater threat to world peace than Europe, so it is appropriate for US foreign policy to increase its attention to Asia. This new US policy follows accusations from several government leaders, such as Sun Ke, that the Soviet Union is aiding the Chinese Communists. Therefore, it is not based on these statements, but rather on a long-term, close observation of China's political and military situation, that the decision was made to change President Truman's policy towards China, announced in 1945. The revocation of the arms embargo can make up for the disappointment felt by the general Chinese population after learning that the 500 million yuan loan would be revoked and reserved. The general Chinese public did not pay close attention to the development of the loan, nor did they have time to analyze it in detail, so they regarded the failure to extend the reservation period of the 500 million yuan loan as a moral blow to China. In fact, as far as I know, China has not applied to the United States for a political loan."</p>
<p>The general public in the capital believes that allowing China to purchase military supplies from the United States is of far greater importance than the sale of 13 million rounds of rifle bullets to China. At the same time, a well-respected official of the Ministry of National Defense told our agency that these 13 million rounds of bullets would not have a decisive impact on China's civil war. According to his personal estimate, these ammunition could last about three months, but it is better than nothing. From the government's point of view, this move can boost the morale of the front lines, especially the troops in the Northeast, who have felt the lack of ammunition.</p>
<p>Political observers here expect that this announcement from Washington will influence the National Government's issuance of a punitive expedition order against the Communist Party. This issue may be discussed tomorrow, when the joint meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Central Executive Committee will be held.</p>
<h3>US Policy Change Toward China</h3>
<p>Predicted by Republican Newspaper</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 29th] The Republican newspaper "Oakland Tribune" predicted on June 26 that due to the current situation in China and the deteriorating crisis caused by the resurgence of the Communist forces, the United States would likely change its policy toward the Dong in the near future. The newspaper's editorial was titled "The Crisis in China". The editorial was published before the State Department issued a statement on the sale of arms and the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, Martin, issued a statement on the loan. The full text is as follows: The tragedy of China is approaching its climax, and the calls for aid to China are becoming increasingly urgent. The Chinese government, through Vice Chairman Sun Ke, has openly criticized the Soviet Union for assisting the advance of the Chinese Communists. Regardless of the Nanjing government's accusations, the facts seem to prove that the Soviet Union has adopted a new policy towards China's protests. Our assumption is as follows: that the Soviet Union has transferred the materials seized from the Japanese in the Northeast to the Chinese Communists. Semi-official Chinese sources have even explained in detail the aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles supplied to the Chinese Communists. At the same time, although the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 stipulates China's rights to Lüda, the Soviet Union has now refused the Chinese government's legitimate right to take over Lüda. The reason for this refusal may be that these two ports are being used to supply war materials to the Chinese Communists. The Export-Import Bank's 500 million loan to China will expire on July 1, and Marshall has indicated in Washington that he will allow the deadline to pass without taking any action. In addition, there has been no indication that there will be other actions in the future. Due to the recent situation in China and the deteriorating crisis caused by the military resurgence of the Chinese Communists, we can expect a change in US policy. This change is expected to be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3>Future US Loans to China Will Be Used to Consolidate the Monetary System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] A certain authoritative figure in the economic field told reporters on the eve of the expiration of the 500 million US dollar loan that future US loans to China would be based on the principle of frequency: the most important thing is to use them to stabilize finance and consolidate the monetary system. Under this principle, if there is a reasonable plan, the US can grant loans. The second principle is to develop both private enterprises and state-owned industries. After private manufacturers receive loans, they will naturally purchase raw materials from the US. If state-owned industries are developed, Sino-US trade can also develop accordingly. Based on the above approaches, the US can definitely continue to grant loans to China.</p>
<h3>Organizational Laws of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Have Been Revised</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The organizational laws of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have been revised and passed by the 329th meeting of the Legislative Yuan. They are recorded below: Article 3 of the revised organizational law of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission stipulates that the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission shall have one Chairman, two Vice Chairmen, and twenty-seven to thirty-five members. Article 4 stipulates that the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission shall hold a meeting once a month, and may convene temporary meetings when necessary. The Chairman shall preside over the meetings mentioned in the preceding paragraph. If the Chairman is unable to perform his duties due to an accident, he shall designate one of the Vice Chairmen to act on his behalf. Article 13 stipulates that the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission shall have four to six secretaries, responsible for confidential party documents, meeting minutes, and matters assigned by the superiors. Article 18 stipulates that when necessary, the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission may, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, establish offices in Mongolia, Tibet, or other appropriate places. Each office shall have one Director, with a simplified appointment, and one Deputy Director, with a simplified appointment.

<h3>Joint Meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee; To Determine Government Policy; Including Political, Economic, and Military Issues</h3>

<h3>Wu Zhihui Discusses the Wanted Order for Mao Zedong; Why Political Parties Need to Resort to Arms; Arresting Rebels is the Duty of the Court</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office issued a nationwide circular to all high courts, strictly ordering the arrest of Mao Zedong. Our reporter believes this is a clear indication that the judicial organs are independently exercising their powers based on criminal law against internal rebellion. It will have a significant impact on the National Government's handling of the CCP issue. Furthermore, there will be an important meeting in the capital today to discuss national plans. It is widely rumored that the National Government may issue a punitive order against the CCP's rebellion. We have specially interviewed various parties to inquire about their thoughts on this matter. The following is a brief record of the conversations:</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui stated: Mao Zedong and Zhu De are leading troops in rebellion, violating criminal law. The court's order for their arrest is within its duty. It is also normal for the government to issue a punitive order. Using force against those who endanger the nation is the government's obligation and not an internal war or factional dispute as some claim. If the Communist Party is just a political party, why does it need to resort to arms? Some years ago, Soviet Marshal Stalin and Trotsky were in the same party. Stalin, to protect the country, resolutely eliminated the Trotskyites without avoiding the appearance of internal strife. This shows that protecting the country, taking unavoidable measures, is the government's duty, and there is nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<p>Warranting Internal and External Rebels is Common in Countries Ruled by Law</p>
<p>Li Shizeng Condemns Mao Zedong for Treason</p>
<p>Li Shizeng stated: The CCP's actions in recent years have been tyrannical, going against the trend, and are no longer those of an ordinary political party. They are practically no different from bandits in Chinese history. Furthermore, their collusion with foreign forces constitutes treason. The Chinese people must oppose such reactionaries. Even if the government issues a punitive order, it is justified. What we should pay attention to is strictly adhering to the principles of the Three People's Principles, using democratic and free politics to unite all forces to quell the CCP bandits' rebellion, but we must not go astray and adopt another form of totalitarianism. Only the power of democratic politics can overthrow totalitarianism. Issuing warrants for internal and external rebels is common in countries ruled by law. Those abandoned by the people are naturally not tolerated by the law.</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan's Three Opinions on the Supreme Court's Measures</p>
<p>Tao Baichuan (Shanghai City Councilor) said: Regarding the Supreme Court's arrest of Mao Zedong, I believe there are three points to note: First, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have advocated a political solution to the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue. However, since Yan'an refused Zhang Zhizhong's visit to negotiate peace, the Communist Party has decisively closed the door to a political solution. However, the National Government continues to declare that it is always ready for peace talks, without changing its original intention due to the deterioration of the Communist Party's attitude. Does this arrest of Mao Zedong mean that a peaceful and political solution is no longer possible? Is it about to issue an order to punish the Communist Party? Will the military actions become more active? Is the reason that the Communist Party problem is no longer a simple internal disturbance but has degenerated into a foreign enemy? This point deserves attention. Second, some people in the central government have long believed that military actions against the Communist Party are a full-scale war. This means that combat should not be limited to the front lines or military affairs but must mobilize the strength of the rear, that is, the political, economic, and cultural forces, to be effective. Does the arrest of Mao Zedong mean the same as punishing the Communist Party, and will the political, economic, and cultural aspects implement a wartime system to cooperate with the military? This is also a major issue. Third, since the amendment of the Emergency Law on Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Communist Party is no longer considered a criminal group in law, and joining the Communist Party is not a criminal act. Now that the leader of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, is being arrested, will the status of the Communist Party also change according to political and legal interpretations, and will Communist Party members become the subject of crimes? The National Government may soon make a clear statement.</p>
<p>Policy Should Implement Constitutionalism as Soon as Possible; No One Can Violate the Law</p>
<p>Lawyer Ma Junshuo expressed his opinion on this issue, stating: For the sake of the country and the people, the government should implement constitutional government as soon as possible, but it must first strictly enforce the rule of law. Strictly enforcing the rule of law means that all levels of the country should act within the legal framework. Anyone who exceeds the scope of the law's regulations, people, regions, and parties is illegal. No party or individual should use force as a tool for political competition. In short, everyone in the country should respect laws and regulations to achieve peaceful unification of the country, and strengthen national defense internationally to maintain its status as one of the five major powers.</p>
<p>The Evolution of the Current Situation Has Become More Complex</p>
<p>Wu Yun Chu (Chairman of the Industrial Cooperation Association) stated: This move will not have a significant impact on the actual situation because both sides have been in a state of war for a long time. On the other hand, this move indicates that the path to reconciliation has been cut off, and the government may further order a punitive expedition. With the evolution of the current situation, the situation has become more complicated due to the existence of international factors. [Our reporter in Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The reporter recently visited Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party to ask for his opinion on the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office's circular to the chief prosecutors of all high courts nationwide, strictly ordering the arrest of Mao Zedong. Jiang said: This may be a substitute for the punitive order against the Communist Party.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Recklessly Destroy and Damage; Losses to Industry and Mining in the Northeast; Spokesman of the Resources Commission Bitterly Narrates Recent Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Since the recent intensification of the war situation in the Northeast, heavy industrial factories and mines have become the targets of deliberate destruction by the Communist troops. As of now, the situation of the factories and mines that have fallen into enemy hands, as well as the government's response measures to the entire Northeast industrial and mining industry, are matters of concern to the people. Yesterday, we interviewed the spokesperson of the Resources Commission on these issues. According to him, although the Northeast industrial and mining industry has suffered repeated destruction, it has been vigorously supported and managed by the Resources Commission for the past year, and it has already achieved some scale. This time, the Communist troops are running rampant everywhere, and the factories and mines have suffered the most, which is very sad. Dealing with the aftermath is also very difficult. In terms of the three major industrial and mining industries in the Northeast, namely electricity, steel, and coal, the power lines from Xiaofengman have been destroyed, and most factories and mines cannot operate because there is no electricity supply. Although production has stopped and income has decreased, expenses cannot be reduced. Not only do the employees of the closed factories and mines need to be maintained, but the long-term workers of Xiaofengman itself must also continue to be supported. In terms of steel, Anshan Steel Company was once in danger due to the tight situation in Haicheng, and production was greatly affected. The 5,000 tons of pig iron shipped by the company to Yingkou were delayed due to the Northeast Economic Commission's slow issuance of export licenses. Moreover, due to the chaotic situation in Yingkou, it has not been shipped out until now, resulting in huge losses. In terms of coal mines, the destruction has been particularly severe. The coal mines that have been captured by the Communist troops, such as the Xi'an Coal Mine in Liaobei, have lost all their coal, equipment, and food. Employees who fled in a hurry need to be resettled and provided with relief. Those that were once captured and have now been recovered include the Benxi Coal and Iron Mine in Liaoning Province, the Beipiao Coal Mine in Rehe Province, and the Yingcheng Coal Mine in Jilin Province. All the equipment on the site has been destroyed by the Communist troops, and the equipment and food have been moved away. After the recovery, work should be resumed as soon as possible, but the equipment is gone, and the facilities are incomplete. There is no ability to replenish them for a while. Those close to the front lines of the war zone, such as the Fushun and Yantai mines, although not yet captured, have had many workers conscripted to assist the garrison in constructing defensive fortifications, and essential mining equipment has also been requisitioned. Production work is on the verge of stagnation. Even if they can be preserved, a large amount of investment is needed to continue production. In short, whether the factories and mines have been captured or not, the government must allocate considerable funds to deal with the aftermath, to comfort and gather the refugees, to replenish equipment, to plan for resuming work, and to maintain the lives of employees. The Resources Commission, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the current measures, the commission has ordered all units in the Northeast to strictly adhere to their posts and not leave lightly unless absolutely necessary. At the same time, they must try their best to preserve factory and mining equipment.</p>
<h3>East Asia Association Established Yesterday; Peng Xuepei Explains Organization Process and Tasks, Elects Directors, Supervisors, and Responsible Persons of the Calling Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] The inaugural meeting of the East Asia Association was held at 9:50 AM yesterday at 1177 Liyang Road (Dickson Road) in this city. Attendees included He Yaozu, Peng Xuepei, Lei Zhen, Fang Zhi, Xu Jiyun, Shao Yulin, Xu Yiqiao, and more than 70 others. Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau attended to provide guidance under the department's mandate.</p>
<p>Interim Chairman's Address: Peng Xuepei served as the interim chairman and delivered an impromptu speech stating: "The current composition of the East Asia Association is the East Asia Research Association of the former Central Propaganda Department and the Reform Society led by General Tang Enbo. The former devoted itself to propaganda against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and made contributions. After the victory, the nature of the task changed. The central government believed that the work of linking the emotions between various ethnic groups should be undertaken by civil organizations. Therefore, it decided to reorganize, and the Reform Society was willing to cooperate, resulting in the organization of the East Asia Association. Our country and the various ethnic groups in East Asia have had relations for about ten centuries. Today, all countries have brilliant achievements. Even new countries such as the Republic of Indonesia, its talents are evident in the Pan-Asian Conference. Our country must have an understanding and connection with these neighbors. The way to start is to assist East Asians in China to enhance friendship between ethnic groups and conduct in-depth research. The study of the Japanese question is the most important. In the current situation, Japan will inevitably revive. The East Asia Association should study our country's correct policy towards Japan for the government to adopt and supervise its implementation." Peng emphasized two points: "(1) The East Asia Association is not aggressive and does not demand that China lead the countries of East Asia, as past Japanese research groups did; (2) The association is not exclusive, advocating international cooperation instead of 'Asia for Asians.'"</p>
<p>Revised and Passed the Constitution: Then, He Yaozu, a member of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparatory process over the past two months. He also stated that the association will devote itself to solving the Japanese question, urging the Japanese people to awaken and no longer dream of imperialism.</p>
<p>After He's report, the chairman invited Li Jianye to give a speech for guidance. Li pointed out the central government's emphasis on the association's work and praised the association's pursuit of the ideal of international cooperation, which is different from Japan's pan-Asianism. He wished the association success. Later, Fang Zhi, chairman of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Zhaorong, representative of the municipal government, successively gave speeches. Afterward, the chairman specially invited Lei Zhen, who had rushed from Beijing to attend the meeting, to give a speech. He briefly stated: The association should promote China's Confucian culture to the countries of East Asia. The advantage of Confucian culture is its peaceful nature, which can eliminate international warfare. Lei expressed deep vigilance about Japan's resurgence, saying that he hoped that China and Japan would no longer be enemies in the future. As long as the Japanese abandon their aggressive ideas, we should fully recognize Japan's strengths and obtain assistance from its talents and resources. After Lei's speech, the constitution was discussed. The draft constitution was revised and passed, with only two points changed: The association's work will add "(1) exchange of students and professors"; (2) Establish branches in important cities in East Asia instead of offices. Then, elections were held to produce directors and supervisors. A meeting of directors and supervisors was held in the afternoon to appoint persons responsible for each section.

<h3>Storing Grain for Famine Prevention: The Ministry of Food Prepares Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 29th] The Ministry of Food has recently prepared concrete measures regarding grain storage and has submitted them to the Executive Yuan. The measures propose to establish grain storage warehouses in counties, townships, and towns across the country to prevent famine years. The measures consist of more than 200 articles, detailing the methods of collecting, building warehouses, etc. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold a subcommittee review on the 30th, and then submit it to the Political Affairs Conference for discussion. The subcommittee will be convened by Jiang Yuntian, and the ministers of the interior, social affairs, food, agriculture and forestry, and Lei Zhen will participate. Jiang told reporters on the evening of the 29th that he believed it would not be easy to implement grain storage at a time when local order was not yet fully stable. If the management of warehouses is not proper, abuses will inevitably arise.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Provincial Assembly Passes Measures to Purchase Grain with Tax; Submits Request to Central Government to Implement Popular Election of County and City Mayors in Advance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] After two days of intense debate, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly finally passed the "Measures for Purchasing Grain with Tax and Purchasing Surplus Grain from Large Households" proposed by the Taiwan Provincial Government. Taiwan Province was originally a rice-producing area, but the rice shortage in the past two years has been caused entirely by grain merchants and hoarders. Chairman Wei Daoming believes that to stabilize society, the government must control a large amount of food. If grain prices rise, it will immediately carry out price stabilization. According to the measures for purchasing grain, which were originally passed by the Provincial Government's regular meeting and now approved by the Provincial Assembly, the part on purchasing grain with tax stipulates that 12 kilograms of rice will be purchased for every yuan of land tax (i.e., principal tax). The part on purchasing surplus grain from large households stipulates that those who pay more than 1,000 kilograms of rice in land tax will have their surplus grain purchased at a progressive rate, with 40% for those with less and 60% for those with more, while those who pay less than 1,000 kilograms of rice in land tax will be exempt from purchase. During the debate on this case, the Provincial Assembly did not oppose the policy of purchasing grain in principle. However, some assembly members believed that the price of NT$27.5 per kilogram of rice was too low, and after intense debate, the original plan was finally passed by a majority. In terms of this case, the majority of people in the province expressed their approval, while those who opposed it were only a small number of large landowners. According to statistics from the Food Bureau, there are a total of 7,252 large landowners in the province.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] The Taiwan Provincial Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to request the Central Government to allow Taiwan Province to implement the popular election of county and city mayors in advance. According to the announcement No. 135, Item 1, issued by Minister Bai Chongxi during his visit to Taiwan, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly will formulate and submit the methods and dates for the early popular election of county and city mayors in Taiwan to the Ministry of the Interior for approval and implementation.

<h3>The Yellow River Dike Has Been in Disrepair for Ten Years; This Year's Danger Is Worrying</h3>
<p>Chen Chongling Discusses Yellow River Management Work</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] Chen Chongling, Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, told reporters: "The danger of the Yellow River today is a hundred times greater than in the past. In the past, repairs were carried out every year, and there were still accidents every year. Now, it has been in disrepair for ten years, and the old dikes and dams have been completely damaged. In addition, the Communist Party's obstruction has prevented the completion of the dike restoration work. Therefore, there will be major dangerous works during this year's flood season. The reconstruction work in the old flooded areas is only at the beginning, and new flooded areas may follow. Therefore, we must do our best to prevent it. We hope that the people will cooperate and assist in the promotion of the work of the Yellow River management agencies. We also hope that the whole country will focus its attention to prevent the serious disasters of the Yellow River in the future."</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Wanted Communist Leader</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday ordered the chief prosecutors of all higher courts in the country to strictly arrest Mao Zedong, stating that the Chief Prosecutor of the Gansu Higher Court reported that the Speaker of the Cheng County Council, Zuo Zhuzhu, and others reported that Mao Zedong was inciting rebellion with troops and requested legal sanctions. After investigation, the rebel Mao Zedong occupied national territory, rebelled with troops, harmed the country and the people, and committed heinous crimes. He should be arrested and brought to justice in accordance with the law in order to uphold the law and discipline. We saw this news report in the newspaper and felt a lot of emotions. Mao Zedong, as everyone in the country knows, is the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party once participated in the War of Resistance and also participated in the Political Consultative Conference with various political parties and organizations in the country to negotiate a peaceful nation-building plan. Unexpectedly, the ink from the Political Consultative Conference was not yet dry, and the agreement on reorganization and unified compilation not only failed to be realized, but also returned to the battlefield with soldiers and weapons. Domestic peace has not been restored. In view of the only wish of the people of the country after the war was peace, this newspaper has repeatedly appealed, hoping that the CCP will prioritize the interests of the people, disarm the party, hand over its military power to the state, and, as a general political party under a democratic politics, seek welfare for the country and the nation. Unexpectedly, the speakers spoke earnestly, but the listeners were indifferent. In recent months, the armed forces of the CCP have intensified their efforts, rebelling with troops everywhere in China, from the Northeast, North China, Northwest to other places. They have also colluded with foreign forces and are stirring up trouble everywhere, openly insulting our government. Their behavior is tantamount to treason. We have long said that the government should order a crusade against these crimes of the CCP. However, until now, the government has not made such an expression. The notice from the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office to strictly arrest Mao Zedong and bring him to justice in order to uphold the law and discipline only targets Mao Zedong and is purely a judicial issue. Although it may not be unrelated to the government's attitude towards the CCP led by Mao Zedong, in terms of the case, this wanted order only involves Mao Zedong personally and has nothing to do with the political party he leads, and is not much different from a general criminal wanted order. The Standing Committee of the Kuomintang will also hold a meeting soon, and the State Council will also meet next week. According to news reports, there will be important resolutions at the meeting. Regardless of the nature of this resolution, the wanted of Mao Zedong has caused us to have the following thoughts:</p>
<p>First of all, we must express our infinite admiration for the Supreme Court Chief Prosecutor's strict enforcement of the law. As we have already said above, Mao Zedong is the leader of the CCP, and although the CCP is rebelling with troops, the government has not yet issued an order to crusade, and still reserves a seat for the CCP in the State Council, waiting in vain; it is obvious that the government has not yet abandoned hope for the CCP. However, the prosecutors of the Supreme Court, based on the people's reports, reviewed the facts, and believed that Mao Zedong committed heinous crimes and should be wanted and brought to justice in order to uphold the law and discipline. This not only fully demonstrates the dignity of the judiciary, but also shows the Chief Prosecutor's loyalty to the country, which is truly admirable. We must know that the problem of the CCP is a political problem, and the solution to this problem cannot be sought in the law. However, Mao Zedong, as a Chinese citizen, rebelled with troops and violated the criminal law, and his actions should be subject to the sanctions of national law, which is undoubtedly true. The issuance of this wanted order has excited the people of the country. No matter what the government decides to do with the CCP problem, since its leader has been wanted, he must follow judicial procedures and be subject to the sanctions of national law.</p>
<p>In the wanted order of the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, the crimes of Mao Zedong that we see are: "Occupying national territory, rebelling with troops"; judging from these words, Mao Zedong has only committed the crime of internal disorder under Article 100 of the Criminal Law. The original article said: "Whoever intends to undermine the group, seize national territory, or use illegal methods to change the national constitution and overthrow the government, and takes action to implement it, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than seven years; the instigator shall be sentenced to life imprisonment": The heaviest penalty he should receive is life imprisonment. However, the CCP's collusion with foreign forces is a fact, and what its leader has committed is not only the crime of internal disorder, but also the crime of foreign invasion. Article 103 of the Criminal Law stipulates the crime of foreign invasion as follows: "Whoever colludes with a foreign country or its agents, intending to cause that country or another country to start a war against the Republic of China, shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment." Now that the case has been filed according to judicial procedures, and will be "brought to justice," our prosecutors, who are loyal to the country, will surely be able to charge him with the crimes he deserves and punish him with national law.</p>
<p>Regarding the wanted of the CCP leader, we cannot help but feel infinitely regretful. The Chinese people's hope that the CCP led by Mao Zedong can immediately lay down their weapons and restore peace cannot be said to be insincere; but the CCP has failed to accept the people's demands, and ultimately had to issue this wanted order. Emotionally speaking, this is, after all, a regrettable thing. However, collusion with foreign forces, occupation of national territory, and rebellion with troops, if this can be tolerated, where will the national law be placed? The Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, as the name suggests, is the highest procuratorial organ. The issuance of this order to maintain the dignity of the national law is sufficient to win the sympathy of the people of the country.</p>
<p>What we cannot fail to point out here is that the leader of the Chinese Communist Party has been wanted, but the State Council still reserves a seat for the CCP. Of course, the former is a judicial problem, while the latter is a political problem. They seem to be unable to be confused. However, if the leader is recognized as "harming the country and the people and committing heinous crimes," the party he leads will naturally also have problems. A judicial problem should be investigated according to the law, but in the political aspect, necessary measures must also be taken in response to the development of the judicial aspect for coordination. Otherwise, it is always a bit ridiculous. As for what measures should be taken, we still hope that the government authorities will consider it wisely.</p>
<h3>A False Alarm in Suzhou; Military Section Chief Arbitrarily Confiscates Self-Defense Force Firearms; Team Members Break Through and Start Rumors; City-Wide Shock</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 29th] Suzhou suffered a major false alarm today, and almost all the shops in Guanqian closed. The reason is that Shen Zixing, the section chief sent by the Provincial Security Command to Suzhou some days ago, reviewed the security team and the self-defense forces of various villages. The county government then ordered more than 1,600 members of the self-defense forces of various villages to gather at the Suzhou City Stadium on the morning of the 28th to undergo inspection. On the afternoon of the 28th, the event had already taken place. County Magistrate Shen Chenglong issued a handwritten order to each team, limiting them to return to their original defenses on the 29th. Unexpectedly, the Military Section Chief acted arbitrarily because he had received a provincial order to re-train the replacement team members of the self-defense forces of various villages in order to unify command. However, due to the difficulty in gathering them, the compliance was delayed. Therefore, he wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to inspect the group to implement it. Therefore, he secretly concealed the order issued by the county magistrate to return to defense and concentrated all the self-defense forces in the stadium at about 10 am on the 29th. At the same time, he arranged security team sentries to guard the entrance and exit. Section Chief Cao publicly announced that in order to organize the public self-defense force, the self-defense forces of various villages were ordered to hand over one-third of the excellent firearms. After speaking, he immediately assigned security team personnel to forcibly confiscate them. About 300 rifles and many machine guns had already been confiscated. Then, some self-defense forces, because the firearms were prepared by the local at their own expense, were unwilling to be confiscated, so they began to agitate for a riot. The order in the stadium was in chaos. In the midst of public anger, they unanimously loaded their guns and rushed out of the gate. Fortunately, the sentries retreated upon seeing this, and the self-defense forces of various villages broke through as they wished, without causing a major disaster. The news spread, and the whole city was shocked, especially in the Guanqian area, where rumors were rampant. After the breakout, the self-defense forces of various villages sent representatives to the council, the party headquarters, the county government, and other places to petition, demanding that justice be upheld. The county governor then hurriedly returned the confiscated firearms and ordered each team to return to defense immediately, and the situation calmed down. Our newspaper reporters interviewed various relevant leaders, who all stated that although this matter did not cause a disturbance, it greatly damaged the government's prestige, and they all advocated a thorough investigation of responsibility in order to appease public anger.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 29th] Cao Yongxiang, the commander of the Suzhou City Defense, led a team to go to Nanjing for training, and his post was temporarily held by Peng Zhan Cun, the deputy commander of the 202nd Division.</p>
<h3>Ping Military Court Tries War Criminals</h3>
<p>Mochikawa Hidekazu's Sentence Scheduled for the 5th</p>
<p>Kiyomizu Toyoo Already Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 28th] The military court here publicly tried Japanese war criminal Major General Mochikawa Hidekazu today. Since the July 7th Incident, the criminal first led the puppet security maintenance association in Tianjin, assisted in the establishment of the puppet Xinmin Academy, and organized the puppet Chinese Inter-Religious Federation. He engaged in luring General Wu Ziyu to come out of the mountain, and established the Mochikawa Agency intelligence organization within the headquarters of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army, specializing in destroying our underground organizations, arresting patriotic people and underground workers, and inflicting cruel torture. The crimes are too numerous to count. The criminal was extremely cunning and denied all charges during the trial. Judge Zhang Dingyang listed the facts one by one for rebuttal, and the trial ended in court. The sentence is scheduled to be announced on the 5th of next month. Also, Japanese war criminal Kiyomizu Toyoo, the commander of the Tianjin 1420 Unit, was sentenced to death for using cruel torture on non-military personnel during the war, and was executed by firing squad this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Becomes a Drug Trafficking Center</h3>
<p>More Than 8,100 Taels of Opium Seized in Half a Year</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 29th] According to authoritative sources here: The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department seized more than 8,100 taels of opium in the past six months, which is worth more than HK$810,000 at current market prices. Among them, 2,580 taels were seized last week from a Kunming-Hong Kong passenger plane at Kai Tak Airport. The Revenue Service believes that the number of opium smuggling cases has been increasing recently, so it believes that drug traffickers are using Hong Kong as one of the drug trafficking centers in the Far East. As for how many "insiders" in Hong Kong are colluding with them, it remains to be investigated.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Hopes to Draft European Reconstruction Plan through the UN Economic Commission for Europe; Rumor Has It That Molotov Has Already Proposed a Suggestion; The Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference Seems to Have Fallen into Serious Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] Today's "Observer" reported: It is heard that the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has put forward a suggestion at the Paris meeting, expressing that the Soviet Union hopes to have the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva draft a European reconstruction plan, and requiring that the Economic Commission should base its decisions on a two-thirds majority vote. The French newspaper went on to say that the Secretary-General of the European Economic Commission, Inder, has indirectly confirmed that the Soviet Union has put forward the above-mentioned suggestion, and the Soviet Union's requirement for a two-thirds majority vote is to grant the Eastern European countries a veto power, because the Eastern European countries account for six of the 17 seats in the commission. It is heard that British Foreign Secretary Bevin advocates setting up an expert committee to draft the plan, and he would be willing to hand it over to the European Economic Commission for drafting only if it can be based on a majority vote.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The foreign ministers of the three countries, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, held their second meeting at 4:10 pm (Greenwich Mean Time) to discuss Marshall's aid-to-Europe plan, and adjourned at 6:35 pm. The third meeting is scheduled to be held on the 30th in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] After meeting for two and a half hours at the French Foreign Ministry today, the foreign ministers of the three powers decided to continue the meeting next Monday afternoon. Molotov smiled cheerfully when he arrived at the meeting place today, but when the Soviet delegation left the meeting place led by the British, they all looked straight ahead, and their expressions seemed preoccupied. Bevin also looked worried when he left the meeting place. It is expected that the development in this second meeting was not as satisfactory as expected. Today's meeting was originally scheduled to start at 3 pm, but it was delayed until 4 pm. Reliable sources confirmed that the one-hour delay was at Molotov's request. Molotov requested the delay until this afternoon at yesterday's meeting so that he could have enough time to ask Moscow for instructions and prepare for today's meeting. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry today denied the American news agency's claim that Bidault had a secret meeting with Bevin this morning. A spokesman for the British delegation solemnly stated that Bevin only met Bidault when the meeting started today. Bevin simply took a car to the suburbs this morning. In the state of strict confidentiality of the meeting, observers here speculated whether Moscow, after receiving Molotov's first report, has decided to preside over Marshall's European plan together with Britain and France. Since today, the Paris press has been rife with rumors that the three-power meeting has fallen into serious difficulties, but responsible officials have expressed disbelief in these rumors. Moscow Radio broadcast a telegram from the Soviet official news agency yesterday, which was highly valued by people here, and believed that it might be the path that Molotov intends to take regarding the Marshall Plan. The telegram suggested that in order to clarify the meaning of the Marshall Plan, the foreign ministers of the three countries should ask the US government to clarify the scope of US assistance that European governments can expect to receive, how much money the US is prepared to allocate for aid to Europe, what conditions it intends to attach when granting loans, and whether congressional approval for aid to Europe is certain. If Molotov really suggests asking the US to ask these questions, there will inevitably be a conflict between the US and the Soviet Union regarding aid to Europe. Marshall has previously made it clear that before the US government applies to Congress for approval of the aid-to-Europe plan, it must first submit a balanced budget table of European needs and capabilities. In addition, there are procedural questions regarding the relationship between the Marshall Plan and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. For the sake of speed, Britain and France only want the commission to become an advisory body on the Marshall Plan and a transmitting body for transmitting the resolutions of European countries to the US government. However, Mittel, the secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, who recently met with Molotov in Moscow, strongly advocated that the commission become the designing body of the Marshall Plan. It is not yet known what the Soviet Union's attitude is. The British delegation hopes that Molotov can accept Britain's opinion, that is, to allow the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to participate in the design after reaching an appropriate time. At the same time, in order to speed up this design work, a special committee should be established by Britain, the Soviet Union, and France as convening countries.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Bidault is expected to protest to the British and Soviet Foreign Ministers today about the leaking of news from the Paris talks.</p>
<h3>Soviet Official News Agency Reveals that the Soviet Union Suspects the Marshall Plan; Says That the British and French Proposals Endanger the Soviet Union's Own Economy</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 29th] After the Paris three-nation foreign ministers' conference set up a "velvet curtain" at the request of British Foreign Secretary Bevin, the Soviet TASS news agency revealed a glimpse of the truth of the conference for the first time today. It is said that the procedures proposed by Britain and France endanger the Soviet Union's own five-year plan and various similar economic plans, so the Soviet Union has made the conference run aground. The British and French proposals expect a kind of "all-encompassing economic plan for European countries," but the Soviet Union feels that "the internal economic affairs of each independent and autonomous nation should be resolved by itself." The Soviet delegation expressed "serious suspicions" about the part related to the Marshall Plan. After French newspapers revealed the details of the French proposal on the 27th, the Soviet delegation was given the opportunity to clarify its views. The Soviet Union's position is that "the work of the conference should be limited to obtaining appropriate estimates from the countries concerned and compiling and reviewing them in order to determine the needs of European countries for US economic assistance."</p>
<h3>Molotov Hopes for Success of Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his address at a dinner hosted by French Foreign Minister Bidault last night at the French Foreign Ministry, stated that there is reason to be hopeful for the success of the current three-power foreign ministers' conference. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also appears not to be genuinely pessimistic about the conference. These statements by the two foreign ministers have proven the rumors of difficulties encountered by the conference to be untrue. After expressing his hope for progress at the conference, Molotov stated that the three foreign ministers all have the intention to overcome various difficulties, so such hopes are well-founded. "We also remember the sacrifices we made during the war, and these sacrifices require us to strive for peace." French Foreign Minister Bidault did not seem as optimistic as the other two foreign ministers. In his welcoming speech, after apologizing for the inadequate hospitality, he pointed out the difficulties facing the current conference, but also expressed hope that the conference would have positive results.</p>
<h3>Austria, Norway, etc. Plan to Participate in European Recovery</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] It is learned that the Austrian government has instructed its ambassadors in Paris, London, Washington, and Moscow to inform the four governments that Austria is closely following the Marshall Plan and is prepared to fully cooperate in its implementation. Yugoslav Ambassador to France, Lisec, also informed the French Foreign Ministry today that Yugoslavia is interested in the three-power talks in Paris and that the Yugoslav government is prepared to participate in the preliminary discussions of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] According to Swiss officials here on the 28th, the Swiss government has notified the United States and other relevant European countries that it welcomes the European recovery plan, so that all countries can contribute to it, but on the condition that it is not subject to political restrictions. If Switzerland is invited, it will participate in cooperation based on this principle.</p>

This matter has been repeatedly discussed with the Soviet Union by the British, but without success.</p>
<h3>US Government Intervenes, Indonesian-Dutch Relations Turn to Ease, Both Sides to Negotiate Formation of Provisional Government</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 29th Broadcast: Since the United States issued a note urging the immediate organization of a provisional government, the situation in Indonesia has eased. Reliable Indonesian sources say that the war in the East Indies has been averted due to the US note. The meaning of the US note is that unless the Dutch government compromises with Indonesia, the Netherlands and Indonesia will not be able to obtain loans from the United States. Indonesian delegation secretary-general Bottega has gone to Jogjakarta at the request of Dutch Governor-General Van Mook to meet with Sukarno. It is said that he will ask Sukarno to provide a written guarantee that Indonesia is willing to accept Dutch sovereignty and decision-making power in the provisional government. Sources said that Bottega has made a verbal guarantee to Van Mook. [Our Report] San Francisco, 29th Broadcast: Former Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir told reporters that he would refuse to resume his post until his request for a fully authorized guarantee was agreed to.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] The United States, at a time when the crisis between Indonesia and the Netherlands has reached its most critical stage, has asked the Republic of Indonesia to immediately establish a provisional federal government representing the entire former Dutch East Indies, and has offered financial assistance. According to reports from Washington, the State Department said that the US government has asked the Republic of Indonesia to cooperate in order to immediately establish a provisional federal government, and promised to provide financial assistance after the government is established. The government of the Republic of Indonesia applied for a loan of $100 million from the United States about two years ago for reconstruction purposes. State Department officials declined to say whether the aid promised by the United States was for this purpose. The State Department's note was delivered by US Consul General to Batavia, Foote, to the authorities of the Republic of Indonesia and forwarded to President Sukarno, who is now in Jogjakarta. The note expressed concern over the delay in the establishment of a provisional federal government and made it clear that the US Export-Import Bank did not intend to consider loans until an agreement was reached to establish such a government. A copy of the note has also been sent to the Netherlands. At the same time, according to reports from Batavia, reliable Dutch sources there believe that the Dutch government will not resume negotiations with Indonesia on independence based on President Sukarno's reply. Observers believe that the crisis between Indonesia and the Netherlands has thus entered its most critical stage. At the same time, the Executive Committee of the Republican Parliament has approved President Sukarno's succession to government power. Some Republican figures believe that if the resigned Prime Minister Shahrir cannot reorganize the cabinet, then the Nationalist Party, the Islamic Party, and the Left Wing Party will form a coalition government.</p>
<p>War Can Be Avoided, Dutch Relieved</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 29th] After the US State Department finally sent a "memorandum" urgently requesting the government of the Republic of Indonesia to cooperate with the Dutch authorities to establish a provisional federal government, Dutch and Indonesian officials today expressed relief. Although both sides did not immediately comment on the US statement, the Dutch appeared relieved that the move had eliminated the need to decide to begin military action. Government officials in Batavia expected the arrest of Dutch troops in the next two days, now they are relieved and smiling. In Yogyakarta, Prime Minister Shahrir is expected to announce today whether he will resume his post, as the US statement supported his claims for concessions to the Netherlands. Left-wing leader Giri may acknowledge Shahrir's right to sign an agreement with the Dutch in future negotiations, which is the condition Shahrir insisted on before considering resuming his post. According to informed sources, US Consul Foote has asked Indonesian leaders to immediately respond to the United States to clarify the current stalemate. Representatives of both the Dutch and Indonesian sides will meet today at the private residence of Dutch Governor Van Mook to discuss the impact of the US statement.</p>
<p>I Ask You to Pay Attention to the Interests of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 28th] Our Consul General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, is busy contacting representatives of various responsible authorities to learn about the latest developments in the serious political situation. Chiang met with Chairman Schemerhorn of the Dutch High Commission today to discuss the rumored "scorched earth resistance" by the Republic of Indonesia, and warned President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia by telegram. Chiang pointed out that in addition to the moral issues involved, it is a complete violation of international law for a revolutionary country to "burn" the property of friendly foreign nationals for the sake of revolution. If the Republic of Indonesia insists on adopting such a policy against overseas Chinese, it will inevitably suffer the consequences.</p>
<h3>Egypt to Ask Security Council to Intervene in Anglo-Egyptian Dispute</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 28th] The Egyptian government has sent its note requesting the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the Anglo-Egyptian dispute to its ambassador to the United States, instructing him to submit it to the Secretary-General of the United Nations as soon as he receives instructions, most likely on July 3. According to responsible sources, Egypt will demand: (1) the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and Sudan; (2) the abolition of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1899 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement regarding Sudan.</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Unanimously Protest News Blockade of Paris Conference; US Officials Silent on Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] American newspapers are unanimously protesting the news blockade of the Paris Three-Power Conference. Some reporters believe that Bevin is responsible for the blockade, while others believe that Molotov is responsible. Walter, a reporter for the "Baltimore Sun," directly criticized Bevin, accusing him of using the US delegation's failure to participate to abandon open diplomacy and restore secret diplomacy.</p>
<p>However, in fact, there is a state of news blockade in the United States regarding Marshall's proposal to aid Europe. Since the Three-Power Conference during the war, there has never been a greater lack of definite information and a greater variety of external speculations than this time. Marshall and State Department officials have repeatedly asked reporters at press conferences not to ask questions about the European aid plan. President Truman, when asked about this, only quoted Secretary Marshall's remarks at Harvard University, refusing to elaborate. US Treasury Secretary Snyder, seeing the external speculations and wanting to correct them, unexpectedly caused a surprising backlash, even leading some people to believe that the US government was divided over the aid to Europe issue. US officials, aware of the backlash caused by Snyder's remarks, have become even more taciturn than before. An official told reporters in a private capacity today that there are only two points that can be stated regarding the Marshall Plan: first, it is a European plan, not a Marshall Plan; second, there is no plan at all at present. In other words, the State Department has not yet formulated a European recovery plan, and no specific decision has been made regarding the form of aid. Another reason for maintaining silence is to avoid premature vigilance and criticism from Congress, as Republican isolationists in Congress, stubborn Democratic members of Southern states with economic minds, and anti-communist and anti-Soviet figures in both parties, if united, will block any aid plan.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Appeals to Senate Committee, Asks for Increase in US Military Spending, Says US Military Strength is Inferior to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] US Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower testified before the Senate Finance Subcommittee today, requesting an increase in the Army Department's budget. He said that the US Army, Navy, and Air Force are now second only to the Soviet Union in the world. Although the Army Department does not believe that war is likely to break out within twelve months, it is not impossible. The House of Representatives' reduction of the military budget by $478 million constitutes a major crisis for national security at the moment and should be reversed. The funds we are requesting will be used to develop aircraft manufacturing, as the Air Force is the first line of defense for the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower stated today that he is willing to retain his military position after taking office as President of Columbia University and work for national security. After reaching an understanding with President Truman and the university's board of trustees, he will be available to be called to the capital at any time for consultation.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Peshawar, 28th] Ghaffar Khan, leader of the Northwest Frontier Province Congress Party, known as the Frontier Gandhi, said today, "We have decided to establish an independent Pakhtunistan, with the Pashtun people exercising self-government." He also said that the British intend to make the Northwest Frontier Province a military base to resist the Soviet Union, and that the purpose of Marshal Montgomery's visit to India and meeting with Jinnah was for this.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 28th] Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, told reporters today that the Congress Party, having fully accepted Governor-General Mountbatten's plan to divide India, is now boycotting the referendum in the Northwest Frontier Province. He also said that the future constitution of Pakistan will grant self-government to the Northwest Frontier Province, placing it on an equal footing with the provinces of Bengal, Sindh, and Punjab. The Northwest Frontier Province's failure to participate in the Pakistan Constituent Assembly will have unfortunate consequences.</p>
<h3>Bose's Huge Assets May Still Be in Taiwan</h3>

At the same time, new methods of spreading disease and famine have also been invented, which can eliminate any human beings who survive the atomic bomb attacks. Therefore, the US State Department must use a maximum of three years to find ways to prevent large-scale destruction.</p>

<h3>Rumors That US Granted Permission to Build Air Bases in Spain; US Fleet Cruises Northern Europe</h3>

<h3>MacArthur Headquarters Releases Report on South Korean Work, Reveals Inside Story of March Coup</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] MacArthur today released a report on the Korean occupation zone for March, revealing an attempt by the Korean right wing to seize the South Korean government, which failed. It said, "On March 2, the former Provisional Korean Government in Chongqing announced itself as the legitimate government and appointed a Consultative Committee, with Syngman Rhee as chairman and Kim Koo as vice-chairman. The military authorities immediately declared this action illegal, and there was little sign of public support."</p>
<p>The report expressed regret over the conflict between people with different political views on Korean Independence Day on May 1, which resulted in several deaths and injuries. On March 22 and 23, an illegal general strike broke out in South Korea, supported by Korean students, and police had to maintain order around Seoul National University.</p>
<p>According to a United Press correspondent in Seoul, the March coup was instigated behind the scenes by Kim Koo. Kim Koo repeatedly said that he would issue a declaration stating that the Provisional Korean Government in Chongqing was the government of South Korea. Such a declaration was finally published in some newspapers in his name, but this action did not receive support and became a bubble. Some observers believe that Kim Koo attempted to gain the backing of the Korean police, presumably believing that after gaining this support, the Americans would have to recognize him. When Kim Koo took this action, Syngman Rhee was in Washington, denying involvement in the matter, but hurriedly returned to Korea. By the time he returned to Korea, the action had subsided as a result of the military government's intervention.</p>
<p>Both Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee opposed the trusteeship system in Korea and did not cooperate with the US-Soviet Joint Commission. Although they had a common goal of opposition, their competition for leadership will inevitably lead to division in the future. It is heard that the two have lost some support from the left wing due to their continued opposition to trusteeship, while the left wing agrees to organize a Korean Provisional Unified Government. Kim and Rhee seem to want to establish a government by Koreans first, and then discuss the unification and independence of Korea with the US and Soviet sides.</p>
<p>MacArthur's report also said that the people of South Korea have continued to take various steps to prepare for final self-government. The Provisional Legislative Assembly drafted a provisional constitution based on democratic principles and allowed men and women over the age of sixty to vote. Industrial conditions have improved, with coal production in February falling short of the limit, but steel production increased.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Joint Committee Moves to Pyongyang to Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 28th] It is learned today that the US-Soviet Joint Committee is scheduled to begin discussions with various Korean political parties in Pyongyang, the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea, on the 12th to establish a provisional unified government. US military commander in South Korea, Hodge, has requested the Soviet side to allow American reporters to accompany the American committee members by car tomorrow as an exchange condition for the American side allowing representatives of the Soviet TASS news agency to come here as observers. However, Soviet commander Kolotkov has not yet replied. The Committee announced that telephone communication and air mail service between Pyongyang and Seoul will be maintained during the meeting.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Announces Dissolution of Ministry of Home Affairs, Implements Local Decentralization</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] The Japanese government announced on the 29th the formal dissolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the implementation of local decentralization of internal affairs in accordance with the provisions of the new constitution. National police and education affairs, which were formerly under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, will henceforth be directly under the jurisdiction of the prefectures and counties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th Special] The dissolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs was formally announced this afternoon. A portion of its powers will be transferred to other ministries, and the remainder will be managed by three organizations: the Autonomy Commission, the Construction Agency, and the Public Security Agency.</p>
<h3>Britain Strongly Protests Against Japanese Hunting Whales in the South, Believes Japan Should Not Compete with Australia</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Regarding the fact that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo allowed Japan to organize a second whaling fleet to go to the Antarctic Ocean for whaling, the British government has lodged a protest with the US State Department through its ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel. It is learned that the wording of the British note is very strong. Before lodging the protest, the British Foreign Office studied the report of the Australian observer who participated in the first Japanese whaling fleet. According to the report, Japanese whaling ships have no equipment for preserving whale oil (whale oil is usually used in the manufacture of margarine), so the Japanese whaling fleet often piles the whale oil on the ship, using only the whale meat for domestic consumption. In principle, whale oil should be publicly sold on the world market through the International Food Organization. However, according to the US occupation authorities, Japan consumed 34% of its meat as whale meat last year, so if Japan does not whale, it will be difficult to meet the meat supply. Regarding this point, the British side said that the Japanese people are by no means meat eaters. We believe that whaling is a matter of Japan's credibility. Japan should not be allowed to compete with Australia and other Allied countries in whaling. The whaling fleets prepared by Australia and other Allied countries will produce all the by-products of whales. In addition, although the second Japanese whaling fleet is preparing to depart, MacArthur's decision has not been formally notified to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington.</p>
<h3>Japanese Katayama to Deliver Policy Address, Various Parties Prepare to Question</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The joint meeting of various parties in the Japanese House of Representatives on the 28th discussed the questioning procedures of various parties on Prime Minister Katayama's policy address and the economic report of Economic Stabilization Board Director Wada Hiroo.

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The national management of coal mines may be a test of cooperation between the two major government parties in Japan, the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Party. At yesterday's economic meeting, all Democratic ministers strongly opposed the coal mine national management draft proposed by Economic Stabilization Board Director Wada Hiroo. They accused the bill of being overly socialist in ideology, overly bureaucratic in control, and easily undermining the growing labor-management cooperation. The Social Democratic Party still insisted on its party policy.</p>
<h3>AURI Announces Welcoming Foreign Investment</h3>
<p>[United Press Tokyo, 29th] The new Japanese Minister of Finance, Auri, stated on the 29th that he hoped foreign investment would flow into Japan's major industries, such as coal mines, electricity, and transportation. "Even small private loans will benefit Japanese industry, making it easy to double production. The majority of these loans will be used to purchase foreign raw materials, which will be repaid in installments through Japanese exports." Auri also mentioned that foreign capital could be invested in Japan's tourism industry.</p>
<h3>Acquitted Japanese War Criminal, Jinbo Returns to Tokyo, Deeply Grateful for President Chiang's Virtue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Philippine President Roxas had appealed to President Chiang to find a way to avoid the death penalty or imprisonment for former Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Jinbo Hisahiko. Jinbo Hisahiko had been tried as a war criminal but was acquitted by the Jinan Court and returned to Tokyo this morning. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, he risked his life to save Roxas's life. Shortly after arriving in Tokyo, he visited the Tokyo branch of the Central News Agency to express his gratitude for their cooperation. In fact, the plan for President Roxas to appeal to President Chiang was initiated by the Tokyo branch of the Central News Agency. With the cooperation of Filipino journalists in Manila, Roxas's appeal to President Chiang occurred in August of that year. Jinbo Hisahiko greatly appreciated the hospitality of the Chinese people, especially General Wang Yaowu, the commander of Jinan, and some friends in Shanghai. He said that General Wang had given him money before leaving Jinan and arranged for him to fly from Jinan to Shanghai, as land transportation between Jinan and Shanghai was still disrupted. This morning, he also visited the Chinese delegation and asked them to convey his gratitude to President Chiang and the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Strange Social Phenomenon in Japan: University Students Becoming Robbers</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The general social unrest in Japan has not improved with the Socialist Party in power. Around 11 p.m. on the 14th of this month, a police officer named Kuwahara Masaharu, from Nogizaka, Tokyo, found a suspicious man. Upon inspecting his bundle, he found a hatchet. The officer questioned him, and the man gave evasive answers. The officer then took him to the station for questioning, where he eventually confessed to his crime. The man's name was Igawa Heihachiro, 28 years old, from Kyoto, a graduate of Kyoto Imperial University's Faculty of Science, and a technical lieutenant during the war. Last April, he worked as a farm laborer at the home of a wealthy farmer named Iyama Heinosuke in Kyoto Prefecture. Recently, he was dismissed due to neurasthenia. On the 4th of this month, he received 800 yen in wages and came to Tokyo. He spent all his wages in a few days and developed evil intentions. On the 11th, he bought a hatchet at a street stall in Ueno. After wandering around for several days, at 11 p.m. on the 14th, he used the hatchet to injure the head of Niwano Fukujiro, a teacher at Akasaka Fuku-machi Elementary School, in Minato Ward, in an attempt to rob him of his possessions and escape. He was discovered at Nogizaka. It is said that he had not eaten for three days from the time he bought the axe to the time he committed the crime. Crimes of this nature are not uncommon, but the fact that it was committed by a Kyoto Imperial University student makes the problem even more serious.</p>

However, Poland fears that its western border may become too closely linked to the German economic system as a result, so negotiations have slowed down.</p>
<h3>British Domestic Issues: Two-Day Debate in the House of Commons</h3>

<h3>French Coal Miners' Strike Ends, Loss of 1.3 Million Tons of Coal Due to Nine-Day Strike</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] Officials announced that the nine-day French coal miners' strike was resolved today. During the strike, France lost 150,000 tons of coal per day, and the nine-day loss was almost equal to one-third of the nation's monthly consumption.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] Reliable sources here stated that Prime Minister Ramadier will draft a comparative table of the French economic and financial situation to determine the extent to which the government can make concessions on labor issues.

If labor leaders are not satisfied with the government's efforts, the strike is likely to expand, and the government may hand over full responsibility to the National Assembly, which could lead to serious political turmoil.</p>
<h3>Southern Government Officially Refuses Investigation Team Entry, Soviet Union Accuses British and American Representatives of Bias</h3>

A government spokesperson also stated that the United Nations Balkan Investigation Team was biased towards the Greek government and "accepted Greek fabricated propaganda," thus "completely losing its qualification."</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 28th] Moscow Radio stated that British and American representatives on the United Nations Balkan Committee had forced representatives from France, Belgium, and Colombia to change their decisions regarding the Greek border dispute. The British and American representatives were biased and intended to fully support Greece's accusations that South, Hungary, and Bulgaria were interfering in its internal affairs.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 26th] Regarding the letter from Greek Ambassador to the United States Dendramis to the United Nations Security Council on the 26th of this month, the Greek Ministry of Propaganda must announce its contents, stating that Greece is prepared to faithfully implement the recommendations of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Team, but if these recommendations cannot be implemented, Greece hopes that the Security Council will take decisive action. The majority of representatives on the Investigation Committee believe that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania are assisting the guerrillas within Greece and encouraging a separatist movement to merge Macedonia into the Yugoslav Federation. In summary, if the recommendations of the Investigation Committee cannot be implemented, the Security Council must intervene, otherwise new turmoil may occur in Southeastern Europe and elsewhere. In addition, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris declared that in order to ease the situation, Greece may abandon its right to demand the implementation of Article 13 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that United Nations agencies may sanction any country that violates the Charter. If the Soviet Union exercises its veto power, the implementation of this article may lead to international complications, so Greece may invoke Article 39 regarding threats to peace.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 28th] The mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Tsaldaris, "Eleftheria," claimed that regarding the Central Committee of the Left-Wing Coalition Front's complaint to the United Nations Security Council on June 9 regarding the groups opposing the Greek government, the government considers this to be an act of treason and will take action against it.</p>

<h3>Investigation Confirms Murder by Collaborator, Lü Fugang is Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] The Pseudo Agent Lü Fugang has recently been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of being a traitor. Lü is 47 years old, from Yingcheng, Jiangsu, and lives at No. 6 Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. According to the indictment, Lü did not engage in proper work. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he participated in the Pseudo Agent Headquarters and served as a member of the Agent Team. At 9:00 am on August 15th, the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he and other Pseudo organization accomplices, such as Wu Zhengming, went to the vicinity of the Citibank Association on Fuzhou Road to plan the assassination of Ji Kunsheng, a Chongqing economic staff member and manager of the Hecheng Bank. On the night of October 18th, the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he again led enemy military police and Pseudo agents to capture underground work comrades Xu Zhaogui, Zhu Xinyuan, and Xu Zhaogui's wife, Xiao Lanhua. Recently, he was suspected of planning to rob the warehouse of the North and South Four Canal Shops belonging to the Jianghai Customs at No. 450 Gaoyang Road. He was arrested by the Shanghai Garrison Command and sent to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. According to the defendant Lü Fugang, although he did not admit to participating in the Pseudo Agent Headquarters,</p>
<h3>Slightly More Pastries Exceeds 10,000 Yuan, Tax Point for Feasts Becomes a Problem Again</h3>
<p>The tax point for feasts in the city was originally 5,000 yuan. The Wine and Cuisine Industry Association believed that it was too low and strongly urged the authorities to raise it to 20,000 yuan. After the Council passed a resolution to appropriately raise the tax point to 10,000 yuan, the Finance Bureau notified the association to comply. It is now learned that the association is now unable to apply for the previously requested tax point of 20,000 yuan due to price fluctuations. Moreover, the current tax point of 10,000 yuan is even more inappropriate. If customers come to the restaurant and order a little more pastries, it will exceed 10,000 yuan. If the pastries are treated as a feast and taxed as a feast, it is also inappropriate. It is heard that the association will again ask the authorities to raise the tax point. Work, participating in the killing of Ji Kunsheng, and arresting Xu Zhaogui, etc., it is confirmed that this matter has been investigated and verified by the Songhu Garrison Command. Moreover, according to He Cheng Bank General Affairs Director Da Yan's testimony, the defendant confessed in the police station that he was assigned to be at the entrance of the bank at the time, and if he could not hit the target at the Citibank Association, he would do it at the entrance of the bank. It is clear that the defendant has committed the aforementioned criminal acts. His actions clearly violated Article 3 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors and Collaborators and should be punished according to Article 2, Paragraph 1. In accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed.</p>

<h3>Sanbei Transport Company's Group A Will Change to Hong'an Name</h3>
<p>[Our reporter] Both Sanbei Steamboat and Hong'an Shipping companies were founded by the late Ningbo businessman in Shanghai, Yu Qiaqing. Hong'an was founded before the Republic, and Sanbei was established in the 30's of the Republic, both with more than 30 years of history. However, after Sanbei was founded, Hong'an gradually shrunk, so few people know about Hong'an to this day except for the shipping and transportation industries. Before the war, the two companies had more than 30 ships, and branch companies were established in various ports along the Yangtze River, with their own wharves and warehouses. Their assets were strong, and they were the crown of private shipping. During the Anti-Japanese War, some ships, such as Changxing Ming, were suspended in Sichuan, and some seagoing ships could not sail upstream, so they changed to flying foreign flags. After the victory, the company returned to Shanghai to resume operations. The second son, Shunqing, and the third son, Shunwei, were in charge of the company's affairs. Later, due to differing opinions, the business was split, and Sanbei was divided into Group A and Group B, with the ships divided equally. Group A was in charge of Quan, and Group B was in charge of. Half a year has passed. Both sides purchased two seagoing ships each. Group A was named Dongshan and Nanshan. Group B was named Weinan and Weidong. Recently, because the names of Group A and Group B were inappropriate to the outside world, Group A plans to change its name and restore the name of Ge An Company, which has a long history. It is heard that it will be implemented from tomorrow. The facade is currently being renovated and the signs are being painted.</p>

<h3>Road Bureau Steel Rails Stolen; Suspects Arrested and Escorted to Shanghai Yesterday; People Near Longtan Caught with Goods and Evidence; Several People Interceded and Offered Bribes</h3>
<p>The Road Bureau Police Department recently cracked a large-scale theft of railway steel rails. The main suspects have been arrested and were escorted to Shanghai yesterday. The case originated in mid-month at Longtan Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line, where a sudden discovery was made that a large number of steel rails, totaling thirty-nine, were missing from the storage yard. The Third Police Station, a branch of the Second Section of the Jingxi Section of the Police Department stationed at Longtan Station, reported the situation to Director Wang Zhaohuai. Upon receiving the report, Wang ordered the case to be solved within a specified time. After extensive investigation, the gang that stole the steel rails was located on the morning of the fifth of this month, around 10:00 AM, hiding on a boat in a secluded area within the Xiaokou River bend, under the jurisdiction of Dahekou Town, Liuhe County, about sixty li from Longtan Station. A large number of officers were secretly dispatched, armed, to make the arrest. They arrived at the location around 2:00 PM and, together with the local Baozhang (local head) Wu Zongru, conducted a search. As expected, a civilian boat was found in a secluded location, and thirty-nine stolen steel rails were seized, along with the main suspect, Wan Yougen. Under strict interrogation, it was learned that the organization consisted of more than ten people, led by Zhang Ating. Zhang was subsequently arrested in a nearby thatched hut, and both the suspects and the stolen goods were taken to Longtan Station. Just as the interrogation was about to begin, Chen Shiyuan, Huang Yaochen, Lin Chaoyang, and three others, claiming to be officials from a certain organization, rushed to the Third Police Station late at night to intercede. The station sternly refused their requests. The next morning, Zhang Yunchang, claiming to be the boat owner, arrived at the station in a military truck, offering 800,000 yuan in legal tender, demanding the release of the detained boat and suspects, and proposing to use the military vehicle to transport the steel rails away. The station immediately detained Zhang, along with the driver Huang Liang, Ding Zhongying, Jiang Bingshou, and the vehicle. The suspects were escorted to Shanghai yesterday. The case involves several active-duty civil servants and military personnel and is currently under strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Police Academy Students Petition in Front of the Garrison Headquarters; For a Humiliated Classmate; Not Dispersed at 3:00 AM This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 1:00 AM this morning, over 1,500 students, nine squads from the entire Shanghai class of the Police Academy, lined up and staged a silent sit-in protest in front of the Garrison Headquarters, claiming that their classmate Wang Baosun was humiliated by the stationed military police at the North Station last night. They requested Commander Xuan to uphold justice, take appropriate action, and punish the offending military police. According to the petitioning students, Wang Baosun, a student in the sixth squad of the Shanghai class of the Police Academy, was a graduate of the seventh class of a military academy who had endured the hardships of the War of Resistance. He had transferred to the Shanghai class of the Police Academy. Last night, around 7:00 PM, Wang, wearing military casual clothes, was seeing off his relatives at the North Station to take the 9:30 PM train to Wuxi. While in the waiting room, the stationed military police believed Wang's attire was improper and forcibly took him to the North Station military police station. According to the petitioning students who spoke to the reporter, according to the Police Academy regulations, military casual clothes are not required to bear symbols or badges. The military police rashly determined that Wang's attire was improper and even used violence against him. After Wang was taken to the military police station, no resolution was reached. Eventually, two other military police officers arrived, pretended to persuade him, and released Wang after he wrote a letter of repentance. After returning to the school, over a hundred classmates in the same dormitory were outraged upon hearing the news and gathered the entire group to petition the Garrison Headquarters late at night. It is reported that Commander Xuan has agreed to personally handle the matter. If the goal of punishing the offending military police is not achieved, the entire group will not return to school. Last night, all the students petitioning at the Police Academy were also wearing military casual clothes without symbols or badges. Although there were over a thousand people gathered, the order was excellent and they had not left as of around 3:00 AM this morning.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Has Evolved into Today's Prosperity Through Several Transformations; Xu Weinan Broadcasts "Anecdotes of Shanghai"</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held its thirteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Xinsheng Radio Station, inviting the famous writer and deputy director of the Shanghai Gazetteer, Xu Weinan, to broadcast "Anecdotes of Shanghai." The following is a record of his speech: In the eyes of modern people, Shanghai is already one of the world's major cities. However, few people know that in the beginning, Shanghai was just a coastal fishing village. At that time, Shanghai was a land of fishing and salt, and the residents relied on fishing and salt production for a living. Shanghai has been able to become the prosperous metropolis it is today through several transformations.</p>
<p>Fishing Village Leaps to Become a Commercial Port</p>
<p>The transformation from the fishing village period to the establishment of Shanghai Town occurred in the late Song Dynasty. At this time, the number of merchant ships importing goods into Shanghai gradually increased, so Shanghai Town was established, and the Shipping Bureau was set up. The so-called Shipping Bureau was an agency specifically responsible for collecting taxes on goods from foreign merchant ships. From this phenomenon, it can be seen that Shanghai had leapt from a fishing village to a commercial port. This was the first transformation.</p>
<p>In the early Yuan Dynasty, Shanghai was upgraded from a town to a county, officially becoming an administrative unit of our country. There were three important reasons for the establishment of Shanghai as a county: First, Shanghai had become the starting point for sea transport, so the Wusong River and Huangpu River became places where ships gathered, and Shanghai became a place where sailors and merchants resided, thus making the market prosperous. Second, at this time, Shanghai was a place for sea rescue, and salt production was particularly prominent, making it an important salt field. Third, the planting and weaving of cotton also developed in Shanghai at this time. Therefore, Shanghai was not only a commercial port, but also established its own industry. All of these factors were enough to make Shanghai increasingly prosperous and necessitate the establishment of a county seat. This was Shanghai's second important transformation.</p>
<p>After the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, in the Qing Dynasty, Shanghai established the Jianghai Customs, and even more merchants from various places came to Shanghai. Shanghai began to have groups of merchants from various places living in Shanghai - guilds and public offices. The Sixteen Piles area also began to become lively. After the Opium War, Shanghai became one of the five treaty ports, and then concessions were opened. More foreigners came to Shanghai, forming Shanghai's abnormal development and dividing it into the Nanshi (Chinese City) and the concessions. Shanghai was designated as a special municipality after 1927.</p>
<p>A Picture of Boiling Waves in the Yuan Dynasty</p>
<p>Old Shanghai had three major industries: fishing, salt, and cotton. Now Shanghai's fishing industry has not developed much, and salt production has long become a thing of the past, so these two industries are not given much attention in relation to Shanghai's history. As for cotton and homespun cloth, more people still know about them, because there are still many cotton fields outside Shanghai, but homespun cloth has long been eliminated.</p>
<p>During the fishing village period in Shanghai, the amount of fish caught was quite large, especially yellow croaker, yellow drum, and pomfret. Now Shanghai has become a major industrial and commercial city, and large amounts of fish need to be transported in from other places. Shanghai can no longer be considered an important fishing production area, but Shanghai fishing boats still have considerable harvests every year. According to pre-war statistics, the catch of Shanghai fishing boats was more than 100,000 dan per year.</p>
<p>Speaking of salt production, because in the old Shanghai, the eastern coastal area had large salt fields for boiling salt, called Xiasha. During the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, salt production in this area was particularly abundant, and it was considered one of the largest salt fields under Songjiang Prefecture, and also the place where the most salt tax was collected. Salt production gradually declined in the early Qing Dynasty and has long become a thing of the past. Now there are still names such as "Sanzao Town" and "Liuzhao Town" in Pudong. The "zao" in these names refers to the stove used for boiling salt at that time. The traces of the salt fields at that time can still be seen in these place names. Chen Chun, the salt commissioner of the Xiasha salt field in the first year of Zhishun in the Yuan Dynasty, once drew a "Picture of Boiling Waves" based on the methods of boiling the sea to extract salt. From this picture, we can still see the procedures for boiling salt and the lives of the salt workers at that time.</p>
<p>White Doors and Red Houses, No Lazy Women</p>
<p>As for Shanghai's cotton production, it has been very developed since the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Cotton production occupied most of Shanghai's territory, and women in rural villages also engaged in spinning and weaving. During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates invaded Shanghai, wantonly burning, plundering, and harassing, but they could not take away this cotton production. By the Wanli period, Shanghai's cotton textiles were popular everywhere, and even imported into the capital. Because the cotton industry was so prosperous, Shanghai became increasingly wealthy, and the lives of the residents gradually became extravagant.</p>
<p>Speaking of cotton fields, we must also mention Huang Daopo of the Yuan Dynasty. According to legend, Huang Daopo was from Wunijing, fifty li east of Songjiang Prefecture. She returned from Guangzhou in the Yuanzhen period of the Yuan Dynasty and taught her skills in spinning and weaving to the people of Shanghai, so she became the first person to improve Shanghai's textile tools and methods. After she taught the new methods of spinning and weaving, women in every household, regardless of wealth or poverty, were diligent in spinning and weaving, so the poems praising the Huang Daopo Temple at that time had a line saying: "White doors and red houses, no lazy women." After she died, people were very grateful for her contributions and built the Huang Daopo Temple in Wunijing. Today, due to the long years, the temple has been abandoned and the original traces can no longer be found. Huang Daopo's tomb is also gone, but the tomb site can still be vaguely identified in Wunijing.</p>
<p>Traces Still Remain in Nanshi</p>
<p>Now Shanghai's cityscape, compared with old Shanghai, has undoubtedly undergone a complete transformation and is completely different. Even in recent decades, it has changed greatly. For example, the Jianghai Customs, which stands tall on the Bund, was first built in the 26th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, rebuilt in the 7th year of Xianfeng, and rebuilt again in the 17th year of Guangxu. The current building of the Jianghai Customs was rebuilt in 1925. Another example is Nanjing Road, where companies and shops are lined up and is the most lively street in the central district. However, during the Guangxu period, both sides were still old-fashioned Chinese buildings, and the only means of transportation were horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws. Now they are all Western-style tall buildings, and the scenery on the road is also completely different from before. In comparison, Nanshi still retains a bit of the atmosphere of old Shanghai. Take the City God Temple as an example. Although it has gone through many vicissitudes, after the victory, it has been renovated. However, except for the addition of a bronze statue of Mr. Li Pingshu in front of Huxin Pavilion and the transformation of Small World into a commercial center, it basically retains its old style. Even the original sites of those shops, tea houses, and stalls are still the same as many years ago, without much change. The City God Temple in Nanshi can be said to be a very interesting temple market. From this, we can also see the simplicity of the old Shanghai city, which contrasts with the prosperous central area, creating a different atmosphere.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wu Machen, a patrolman in the Jianghai Customs from Xuzhou, 54 years old, lived in a shantytown on a small road behind Yongxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei.

At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, when he returned home from work at the Customs, he bought a package of baking soda from Tianshengtang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop at the intersection of Qiujiang Road for 2,000 yuan and took it home to swallow.

<h3>Two Shanghai Chinese Medicine Colleges Ordered to Suspend Operations by the Ministry of Education</h3>

<h3>Middle School Teachers Request Summer Relief Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Education Research Association will issue a declaration on the summer life problems of its members and appeal to the relevant authorities. The original text is as follows: "The treatment of our middle school teachers is meager, especially the treatment of teachers in private schools, which depends on whether the tuition income is sufficient and whether the school's finances are transparent. Generally, middle school teachers teach at least 20 hours a week and as many as 30 hours or more. In this busy work, they are not well-fed or well-clothed, and they worry about oil, salt, firewood, and rice every day. How can they dedicate themselves to their work when their lives are unstable? At the beginning of this semester, some private schools had payment methods that paid once a semester or once every three months. Of course, the enlightened school authorities believed that this was preferential treatment for teachers, allowing them to receive a larger sum of money, but prices were soaring, so the money at the beginning of the semester was not enough by the middle of the semester and is now reaching the point where it cannot be maintained. What about the many schools that still pay monthly? Now there is a long vacation before the next semester begins. In today's general rise in prices, teachers with monthly income cannot maintain themselves, let alone those without income recently. How will they get through this difficult period? The colleagues of the Middle School Education Research Association have experienced the hardship of their colleagues' lives firsthand. We request: (1) That the educational administrative authorities immediately investigate teachers in need of relief at the end of this semester and provide a one-time relief fund. (2) If relief funds cannot be raised for the time being, the government can negotiate with the banking syndicate for interest-free or low-interest relief loans for teachers in need of relief. Our request is not great. If the wise authorities accept and implement it, the thousands of teachers who benefit will be extremely grateful. The government will also have a great effect on stabilizing people's livelihoods. We hereby sincerely appeal for your adoption."</p>

<h3>Wimbledon Men's Singles Semifinals Begin Today; Women's Singles Down to Last Sixteen</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Wimbledon, 28th] The Wimbledon tennis men's singles semifinals are scheduled for the 30th, with the following lineup: Kramer (USA) vs. Geoff Brown (Australia), Falkenburg (USA) vs. Pails (Australia), Tom Brown (USA) vs. defending champion Betra (France), Beatty (USA) vs. Troeni (Czech Republic). Except for Beatty, all are seeded players. The women's singles have been reduced to the last sixteen, with no upsets.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Wimbledon, 28th] A major upset occurred at the Wimbledon tennis tournament today when 23-year-old American player Percy Beatty eliminated Australian champion and second seed Brown Vicksburg in a hard-fought five-set match with scores of 6-4, 0-6, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4. Beatty's shots were very stable. He took the lead in the first set with a 4-3 score and won 6-4. Beatty cramped up in the second set, leading the audience to believe that there was no hope for him to recover. Unexpectedly, Vicksburg's shots became erratic in the third set, hitting the net and going out of bounds, and Beatty took a 2-1 set lead. Vicksburg improved significantly in the fourth set, but after Beatty won the first game, Vicksburg won six consecutive games. However, Vicksburg could not maintain his normal state in the final set and ultimately lost. Czech star Troeni won by default as Argentine Moria withdrew due to a shoulder injury. American Kramer defeated Sweden's Johnsen, but it was a difficult victory. Johnsen took a 5-4 lead in the first set and unfortunately lost both "set points." The scores were 7-5, 2-2, 6-3. Australian Pails defeated France's Artseren 6-2, 6-1, 6-4. American Falkenburg defeated Austria's Rittel 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.</p>

<p>Mixed doubles: Tom Brown and Miss Osborne defeated British Morton and Mrs. Bathstoke, 6-0, 6-3. Vicksburg and Miss Bairen defeated British Dalley and Miss Nubzhi, 6-1, 6-2.</p>

<h3>Textile Adjustment Committee Hosts Cotton Yarn Price Negotiation; Implements Joint Distribution System; 20-Count Yarn Priced at 8.8 Million Yuan Per Piece; Yarn Merchants Can Add 5% Profit Margin Based on Factory Price</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Due to the recent rise in yarn prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee received a central government order to earnestly continue price negotiations. After repeated meetings and discussions, no concrete decision was reached. Around 5:00 PM yesterday, Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, specially invited all directors and supervisors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association to a tea party at his residence. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Director Zou Bingwen of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and others also attended. After discussions lasting until around 8:00 PM, the final key points were reached: (1) Implement a joint distribution system. (2) 20-count yarn will be priced at 8.8 million yuan per piece. (3) Future cotton yarn price negotiations will be conducted in a dynamic manner. The plan will be distributed by the Textile Adjustment Committee via telegraph to the governments of Beijing and Shanghai, the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the governments of Wujin, Wuxi, and Nantong counties, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, and the Shanghai Yarn Business Association, and will be implemented immediately upon receipt. The detailed measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cotton yarn prices will be reasonably negotiated at any time in a dynamic manner based on production costs and with reference to market conditions, in order to achieve the effect of stable prices. (2) This committee will supervise state-owned and private yarn factories to prepare a large amount of cotton yarn and implement joint distribution, temporarily using the China Textile News Agency to handle various procedures. (3) The prices of cotton yarn of various counts have been agreed upon by the Price Negotiation Subcommittee of this Committee: 10-count yarn is 6.12 million yuan per piece, 16-count yarn is 7.74 million yuan per piece, 20-count yarn is 8.8 million yuan per piece, 32-count yarn is 12.94 million yuan per piece, and 42-count yarn is 17.24 million yuan per piece. All of the above agreed-upon prices are the maximum factory selling prices. Yarn merchants can add a profit margin when selling yarn based on the factory price, but the maximum is 5%. Cotton yarn of various counts and brands not listed above should generally be priced according to market custom, with reference to the fixed price. In general, the price of cotton yarn of the same count should not exceed the above agreed-upon maximum selling price. (4) After the cotton yarn price agreement is announced, state-owned and private yarn factories should strictly implement it. If any violations of the price agreement or private sales on the black market are discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of Textile Construction Company Decides on Business Policy; Full Production Can Be Resumed Within Three Months if Coal Supply is Proper and Situation in the Northeast is Good</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The first joint meeting of the second session of directors and supervisors of the China Textile Construction Company was held in the company's conference room at 4:00 PM yesterday. All 15 directors and supervisors attended, and Chairman Chen Qitian presided over the meeting, which adjourned around 7:00 PM. Important motions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Business policy (A) Increase production: If the coal supply is normal and the situation in the Northeast is good, it is planned to restore all unstarted spindles and looms within three months. (B) Raw material supply: (1) For raw cotton, 1.5 million dan can be collected in the first quarter (from August of last year to July of this year), and it is planned to collect 3 million dan in the next quarter. (2) Machine parts, (3) Materials. For the above two items, domestic purchases will be prioritized if they can be produced or purchased domestically. The company's Qingdao First Chemical Plant is scheduled to start production in the middle of this month, producing caustic soda for use by the company's printing and dyeing plants. For steel wire heddles, the company needs a minimum of 1,000 sets per year, most of which will be purchased from the China Textile Machinery Company, and a small portion will be purchased from abroad.

<h3>Jewelers' Restoration Is Hopeless; Petition Representatives Have Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Representatives of jewelers from all over the country went to Beijing to petition, requesting improvements to the regulations on the buying and selling of jewelry gold, raising the price limit, and allocating jewelry gold and raw materials. The National Economic Commission has already resolved on this matter a few days ago, maintaining the original resolution. The reason is that changing the measures for handling jewelry business stipulated in the economic emergency measures plan under the current financial turmoil will shake foreign exchange and stimulate prices. Therefore, although the national jewelry industry has petitioned several times, the result has been no gains. Wu Pengnian, Yao Guiqing, Chen Dezhang, and Fa Yunliang, four representatives from Shanghai, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. They said that the Executive Yuan proposed reducing the fineness of jewelry gold and restoring sales, but representatives of jewelers from all over the country did not accept it due to issues such as worker skills, customer mentality, and business operations. Therefore, there is no possibility of changing the jewelry sales methods in the short term. Regarding the future survival of large and small jewelers in this city, the guild will convene a board of directors and supervisors meeting this afternoon to discuss and decide.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Cigarettes: Raw Materials Difficult to Acquire; Main Reason for the Decline of Local Chinese Cigarette Factories in This City</h3>
<p>Chinese cigarette factories in this city have recently been reducing production or even cutting back on work. The reasons for this, in addition to narrow sales channels and declining business, are also mainly high costs. Among them, such as tobacco, the production areas of American tobacco leaves in China are originally in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Anhui. Since the fierce battle in Shandong and the interruption of the Jiaoji Railway, Shandong tobacco leaves have completely disappeared. Anhui tobacco leaves do not have a large output, and they are all bought up nearby by numerous small cigarette factories, and very few are transported to Shanghai. Only Xuchang in Henan remains, and the tobacco leaves produced there cannot meet the demand, and the shipping costs along the way are very high, pushing the market price higher and higher, now reaching 26,000 to 27,000 yuan per pound, which is more expensive than the best quality American tobacco. (According to the official exchange rate, the cost of importing the best American tobacco to Shanghai is only 18,000 yuan.)</p>
<p>Furthermore, only one-third of the import quota for cigarette paper needed for making cigarettes can be supplied. The Minfeng Paper Mill can only supply one-fifth. If cigarette paper imports cannot be increased in the future, or Minfeng's production cannot be increased, then cigarette production will be severely affected. As for tinfoil paper, it is also impossible to meet the demand due to insufficient domestic production (only one factory, Hualv Tinfoil Factory, and it has been shut down for several weeks) and import restrictions. In terms of wages, the packaging work of cigarettes still relies on manual labor, and wages are also quite high. In addition, the biggest difficulty for cigarette factories is the lack of operating funds. If they borrow from outside, the terms are short and the interest rates are high, and the factories have difficulty raising funds in terms of light economy. Under these various difficulties, the future of the cigarette industry in this city is particularly bleak.</p>
<h3>Estimated Cotton Yarn Exports This Year May Reach One Million Pieces</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] It is reported that the authorities will use the total production of yarn and cloth by national and private yarn factories in the country last year to meet domestic needs, and export the increased production this year. According to an estimate by a textile industry authority: If this news is indeed true, then the amount of cotton yarn available for export this year will increase significantly. Based on the production volume of various counts of cotton yarn last year, state-owned factories produced approximately 460,000 pieces, and private factories produced approximately 600,000 pieces, with a total production of just over 1 million pieces. It is estimated that this year, state-owned factories can produce approximately 800,000 pieces, and private factories can produce approximately 1.2 million pieces, with an estimated total production of approximately 2 million pieces. Then the estimated amount of cotton yarn available for export can reach approximately 1 million pieces. However, this estimated production volume has not yet recovered to the pre-war production level. The pre-war production volume of cotton yarn in China could reach 2.5 to 2.6 million pieces per year.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Ramie Cloth Production and Sales in Liuyang and Liling</h3>
<p>[Changsha News] Ramie cloth, a local product of Liuyang and Liling in Hunan Province, has a long history and is renowned. Before the 20th year of the Republic, it was sold throughout the country, the Far East, and the Americas. During the Anti-Japanese War, domestic sales were quite good. After the restoration, due to the continuous dumping of foreign yarn and cloth, no one was interested in domestic ramie cloth. Ramie cloth is a rural family handicraft industry. From retting hemp to spinning and weaving, it takes as long as half a year. Therefore, the output is not large, and the cost is also high, but the price is still low compared to the price of silk, yarn, and cloth produced at home and abroad. Currently, the production volume in both areas is very small. If you collect forty or fifty pieces at a time, it is difficult to gather them. Ramie cloth types are currently divided into account ramie, printed (floral) ramie, medium bleached, medium fine, upper fine, and extra fine varieties. The market price is approximately 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per piece (five city feet).</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Commodity Prices Fall</h3>

<h3>This Year's Production Could Reach 50,000 Piculs. Optimistic Outlook for Taiwan Tea Exports. Shou Jingwei Announces Results of Inspection Trip to Taiwan.</h3>
<p>The sluggishness of tea exports is mainly due to the difficulty in balancing domestic and foreign markets. In addition, the lack of a unified promotion agency within the country and the inability to standardize prices abroad have led to a situation where domestic tea merchants cannot concentrate and foreign tea prices have gradually plummeted. The China Tea Industry Joint Operations Corporation, recognizing this, has decided to revitalize export methods and jointly cooperate with well-known foreign merchants. The first step is to ask Chinese and foreign tea experts to evaluate and grade the 80,000 boxes of export tea mortgaged to the Farmers Bank of China by various tea states last year. The Qimen portion has already been completed. Tunlv and Pingshui will also be completed in order. Once all are completed and the National Bank agrees to allocate funds, they will be handed over to the company to transfer to the tea merchants to redeem the mortgaged tea boxes. Then, the company will establish another agency to centralize promotion and seek unification.</p>
<p>Shou Jingwei, the general manager of the company, decided to apply this method to the Taiwan tea industry in order to expand business. To this end, Mr. Shou went to Taiwan on the 17th of this month to preside over the opening of the company's office in Taiwan Province, and visited various tea-producing and tea-making areas for a general inspection. He returned to Shanghai after completing his public duties last week. It is said that Taiwan Province produces oolong tea and black tea, which are famous all over the world, especially oolong, which is well-known and spread throughout Europe, America, and the Near East. Before the war, the highest production in Taiwan reached 4 million catties. The tea gardens in Taiwan expanded to 45,455 jia (each jia is equal to 14.5 mu). The manufacturing plants are large in scale and fully mechanized. According to surveys, there are 49 in Taipei, 5 in Hsinchu, 137 in Taichung, and 12 in Kaohsiung. In the past, during the Japanese occupation, tea exports were a major commodity, which not only invigorated the rural economy, but also enriched the national treasury and earned foreign exchange, making it a strong competitor to my country's tea industry. During the war, the Japanese tried to increase food production, the tea fields were barren, and the manufacturing plants were gradually destroyed. Its production is no longer what it used to be. However, it is understood that this year's total production in Taiwan can still reach 50,000 piculs. If it is not affected by typhoons in the next two weeks, the total amount may exceed this number.</p>
<p>It is also estimated that 10% of this can be oolong tea. Oolong is the most precious in Taiwan. According to overseas prices, the average price is 55 cents per pound in US dollars, while black tea can be sold for more than 40 cents. Mr. Shou also said: During this trip, what he felt most excited about was that the heads of various agencies and local people in Taiwan Province were able to cooperate sincerely. The most helpful factor in promoting Taiwan tea was the Taiwan Bank's approval of NT$200 million in tea loans, including purchasing, primary processing, processing, and transportation. If unified action is taken for external promotion and uniform prices are maintained in the future, the future of Taiwan tea is very optimistic.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Farmers Bank of China, the tea production this year is not good because the tea stored in the 35th year of the Republic of China is still mortgaged and has not been sold. The tea farmers believe that the tea stored in the 35th year of the Republic of China has no sales channel, and the new tea this year will inevitably be the same. In order to avoid losses, they are not interested in making new tea this year. In order to save the crisis of Hua tea exports, the bank will suggest that the government purchase the tea stored in the 35th year of the Republic of China at a fixed price to encourage the production of new tea. The government's fixed purchase price must give merchants a legitimate profit, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results.</p>
<p>It is also said that the old tea currently being auctioned by the Central Trust of China is old tea from the 20th to the 34th years of the Republic of China. Many of them are moldy and of poor quality. In order to improve the sales channel of new tea, the bank will also suggest that all of this old tea be burned to fully promote new tea.</p>
<p>This Year's Tea Production is Small but of Good Quality</p>
<p>This year's tea production season is coming to an end, and the quality of new tea produced in various producing areas is better than in previous years. There are two reasons for this: (1) The weather in each producing area this year is very good. My country's tea industry has not yet reached the stage of mechanization. The use of manual tea production requires good weather to evaporate the eternal part of the tea leaves. (2) The Farmers Bank of China's tea loan is properly organized. Tea farmers can mortgage the tea to the Farmers Bank of China when they use the loan to make good tea, so as to avoid capital being stranded.</p>
<p>However, although the quality of tea produced this year is good, the output is very small. After the Farmers Bank of China thoroughly investigated the reasons, such as the increase in costs and the high cost of labor after the rise in rice prices, the Farmers Bank of China's loan was too small to support it, so it had to be suspended. Now, the Export Promotion Committee will jointly discuss with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Central Bank to strengthen the production and export of Hua tea in the Hua tea producing areas. It is reported that the Farmers Bank of China may relax the limits on processing loans to protect the legitimate profits of tea merchants and tea farmers.</p>
<h3>The Export Control Commission Treats Controls and Does Not Discriminate Against American Businesses</h3>
<p>Regarding the American businessman's telegram to the State Council of his country, attacking my country's Export Control Commission for treating American businessmen harshly, and requesting the American authorities to reconsider aid to China, the spokesperson of the Export Control Commission yesterday said: American businessmen's attacks on my country's import control methods are not the first time. This American businessman's doubts are all misunderstandings. The explanation can now be divided into two points:</p>
<p>(1) Since the Export Control Commission was ordered to implement the import control measures, it has never favored one party and demanded from the other. In order to strictly implement import control, all parties are dissatisfied, which is not limited to foreign merchants, but also Chinese merchants are dissatisfied. The fact can prove that the Export Control Commission does not discriminate against American businessmen.</p>
<p>(2) The United States claims that the items approved for import by the Export Control Commission are all materials from wealthy families. This point is also just a conjecture of suspicion. Since its establishment, the Export Control Commission has never allowed wealthy families to use special relationships to import materials. The materials they import also need to be approved by the Export Control Commission and imported within the quota. There are many materials that are outside the quota and prohibited from import that are detained or not allowed to be imported by the Export Control Commission. This can be checked in the accounts, and the numbers will be made public soon so that all parties can understand the inside story. Based on the above two points, it is hoped that the doubts of American businessmen are all misunderstandings and are definitely not facts. It is also reported that the relevant parties revealed that the association has drafted a document to refute and explain the American businessmen's doubts one by one. After being approved by Zhang Jiajiao, the chairman of the association, it can be submitted to the US State Council by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The Silk Weaving Industry's Yarn is Distributed Uniformly by the Association</p>
<p>The original yarn for the silk weaving industry was directly applied to the Textile Construction Corporation for yarn distribution. Now, in order to simplify the yarn distribution procedures, the Textile Construction Corporation ordered the silk weaving industry association to purchase and distribute it uniformly. The industry association has issued a notice to all members to register with the association for the monthly demand. The registration period ended yesterday (29th). Failure to register after the deadline will be regarded as voluntarily giving up the current yarn rights, and no supplementary procedures will be allowed.</p>
<p>This Year's National Cotton Field Estimates</p>
<p>The Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Joint Association of the Cotton Textile Industry of the Republic of China jointly announced that the cotton fields in all provinces have increased this year. There are no more than three reasons for this: (1) After eight years of resistance war, cotton farmers suffered greatly and seeds were lacking. The Cotton Production Improvement Office has a large supply of good seeds this year. (2) Financial institutions provide substantial assistance to cotton farmers, and cotton production loans (including physical objects such as fertilizers and medicines) are widely provided, so that cotton farmers do not have to worry about the lack of production costs. (3) Before the cotton planting in the spring of this year, cotton prices soared. The above three factors are all excellent conditions for increasing cotton fields.</p>
<p>This survey is limited to before June 1 of this year, and some counties failed to conduct on-site surveys due to special circumstances, such as Anyang and Tangyin in Henan; or the surveys were not precise due to the difficulty of work, such as Yancheng, Funing, and southern Shandong in northern Jiangsu. The cotton field figures for each province are listed below:</p>
<p>Province Area of cotton field (thousands of municipal mu)</p>
<p>Hebei 6000</p>
<p>Shandong 2800</p>
<p>Shanxi 660</p>
<p>Henan 4000</p>
<p>Shaanxi 3180</p>
<p>Hunan 990</p>
<p>Shanxi 280</p>
<p>Hubei 7200</p>
<p>Anhui 710</p>
<p>Jiangsu 7000</p>
<p>Zhejiang 1620</p>
<p>Sichuan 3400</p>
<p>Liaoning 1200</p>
<p>Total 39040</p>
<p>The weather was still good during the cotton sowing period this year. Although some areas in the Yellow River basin were slightly dry, there was generally no significant impact. In some areas of the Yangtze River basin, such as Huarong County, the temperature was slightly lower in early May, and in areas such as Taijia, from late April to early May, but it did not have a major impact on the growth of cotton.</p>
<p>In summary, the national cotton field this year is 39,040,000 municipal mu, an increase of 9,622,000 municipal mu compared with the 29,418,000 municipal mu announced by our association. Although there is a difference from our expectations, in the midst of war, this trend is still satisfactory. If the situation is clear, the increase in production will definitely not be limited to this.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Yarn Cloth Seized by the Former Economic Supervision Group is All Handled by the Textile Adjustment Committee</h3>
<p>The former Economic Investigation Team seized a large amount of stockpiled cotton yarn and cloth in order to crack down on illegal merchants' speculation. Now that the team has announced its abolition, the seized goods that were sealed are now ordered to be handled by the Business Department of the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. According to news from relevant parties, the disposal of all the seized cotton yarn and cloth is expected to be tendered in batches in the middle of next month.</p>
<p>In addition, the municipal government has ordered the yarn factories and cotton industry associations to report the amount of raw cotton stored for yarn production before today in order to stop the rising cotton yarn prices. The city government is preparing to launch a thorough investigation of cotton stored in warehouses starting next month. If there is any false information, they will be dealt with according to the law.</p>

<h3>Unveiling the Secrets of Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Hollywood, 16th (Airmail Dispatch) Our Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Is Hollywood mysterious? Not really. Smooth roads, orderly buildings, and it is no different from many other American cities. Year-round sunshine, palm trees spreading across the fields, and even the fervent, exciting Spanish atmosphere of Central and South America, can be seen in any town in California, and are not unique to Hollywood!</p>
<p>However, Hollywood is indeed mysterious. Those who have not been to Hollywood would surely imagine: Hollywood is full of movie stars, and movie stars, in any country, lead romantic and absurd lives. Before I came to the West Coast, I heard many "New Yorkers" say: Hollywood is crazy, you will be immersed in this sea of madness!</p>
<p>How Much Investment is a Big Key</p>
<p>The reality is not as crazy as the legends. During my nine-day stay in Hollywood, I felt that the atmosphere of "doing practical business" in Hollywood is much stronger than the atmosphere of "pursuing art." In a capitalist society, industry and commerce come first. I don't believe that those artistic workers in Hollywood are striving for an artistic ideal. Of course, in Hollywood, there are also people who live for artistic aspirations. For example, Mr. Geng Tingsheng, a set designer at Columbia Pictures, whom I met. Looking at his tousled hair characteristic of art personnel, and his greasy tweed suit, his conversation, his actions, and even the ideals in his mind, seemed to have been isolated, no, at least temporarily forgotten about real life. However, such people are, after all, few. The company bosses, screenwriters, directors, and actors I came into contact with in Hollywood, the moment they opened their mouths, they boasted about their wealth, or the assets they invested in the film industry. They felt that taking these words to boast to a Chinese news reporter who had come from afar would enhance their identity and status.</p>
<p>I am not criticizing them for not being justified. In a commercial society, capital is paramount. How good or bad a movie is, and how much is invested, is a very important key. One boss asked me: How much capital does a domestically produced Chinese film require? I said, I'm not very clear, probably at least 10,000 to 50,000 yuan. He asked again: How much is that in US dollars? I calculated that it was probably several thousand US dollars. He laughed loudly: "How can that work? Our films cost at least two million dollars, and some cost more than ten million!" A director next to him added: "Some even cost twenty million US dollars!"</p>
<p>This is just an example. The thousands of people in Hollywood, living in artistic circles, often recite money figures as if they were the "Bible." During my short stay in Hollywood, many people told me: The great singer Bing Crosby gets US$5,000 for singing for one hour for a record company. Hard-boiled actor Clark Gable signed a long-term ten-year contract with MGM last year, with a weekly salary of US$7,500. It is said that these two big stars are the highest-paid people in Hollywood today. The person who told me especially added a note: "Pay attention, the contract is for ten years. There is no boss in the world who would be so generous as to support a young star until they become old and decrepit!"</p>
<p>When I met Mr. Kennedy, a producer at Columbia Pictures, he said: "Columbia now pays the big star Dick Powell a salary of $20,000 a week." Afterwards, many people doubted this figure. They said: Gary Cooper at MGM now only makes $2,000 a week.</p>
<p>Global Wealth is Sent to Hollywood</p>
<p>Mysterious figures create the mystery of Hollywood. Now, the wealth of the world is obediently sent to Hollywood (I don't know if Soviet Russia is showing American movies). Piling up every bit of Hollywood's prosperity. Now, Hollywood has: the most "aristocratic" life in the world, villas on Beverly Hills worth fifty million dollars, hotels costing sixty-eight dollars a day, the most exquisite clothing in the world, and beautiful 1947 cars. Hollywood Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, are full of splendid restaurants, cafes, and countless nightclubs of all sizes, as well as the so-called "Chinese Theater" which is a case of "hanging a sheep's head but selling dog meat!"</p>
<p>Chinese Theater - Stone Lions Guard the Entrance</p>
<p>The Chinese Theater is on Hollywood Boulevard, with a majestic palace-like exterior, and a pair of "stone lions" transported from China standing at the entrance, along with Chinese couplets inscribed. Inside, it still shows American movies. It is said that American tourists come to Hollywood year-round, and clever theater owners use this "novelty" psychology to make money.</p>
<p>Methods of making money are readily available in Hollywood, and many people "rely on" the mysterious film industry. Hollywood's film industry only began to expand on a large scale after the First World War, and Hollywood's population also surged within these twenty years. After the end of this war, soldiers who had previously come from the inland, passed through Los Angeles to Hollywood to go overseas, and after returning to the United States, they brought their wives and moved to live near Los Angeles, because it was easy to make money, the weather was good, and they could broaden their horizons!</p>
<p>Twenty Years of Time - Barren Land Becomes Residential Area</p>
<p>A geographical concept urgently needs to be explained, that is, the relationship between Los Angeles and Hollywood. Not only are Chinese people confused about it, but even Americans on the East Coast are also confused. Let me give an analogy: Los Angeles is like Shanghai, and Hollywood is like Jiangwan or Hongkou. Jiangwan is a part of Shanghai, and Hollywood is also a part of Los Angeles. Thirty or forty years ago, Los Angeles was just a pitiful little seaport, and Hollywood was also desolate and bleak. Many capitalists from Chicago, New York, and Detroit, after making money, bought a barren mountain in Hollywood, built villas, and spent their twilight years there, because Hollywood had good sunshine and a good environment.</p>
<p>However, in the blink of an eye, the sea has turned into mulberry fields! In twenty years, Hollywood has transformed itself into the holy city of the film industry, the Jerusalem and Mecca for young men and women. Hollywood has not only blended with Los Angeles, but is also constantly expanding and developing, all the way to the seaside. Twenty years ago, the barren hills on the Pacific coast have now become the most expensive residential areas in the world. The roads, like screws, spirally twist and turn between the mountain peaks.</p>
<p>Due to the fear of earthquakes, Los Angeles and Hollywood do not have high-rise buildings like New York, Chicago, and Shanghai. It is an orderly, clean, and completely flat city, and it is also the city with the widest flat area in the world. Living in Los Angeles and Hollywood, if you don't have your own car, it's really a terrible thing. There are not many buses, and they run too slowly. Los Angeles and Hollywood have no subways.</p>
<p>During my first few days in Los Angeles, I was very worried about the transportation problem. The high prices of hotels in Hollywood scared me into having to live in the city of Los Angeles, but the twenty-mile commute was very difficult, until I found two American friends, and troubled them to drive me around every day.</p>
<p>"My friend" Vogel was a film director more than ten years ago. He directed the earliest "Charlie Chan" detective stories. Vogel believes that the death of the first "Charlie Chan" was a great loss to Hollywood. During the war, Vogel was a lieutenant colonel in the army and went to Italy. I met him in Rome, and he was introduced to me by Dr. Xie Shoukang, the minister to the Vatican.</p>
<p>Faded Beauty - Golden Age Too Short</p>
<p>Vogel now runs a record company, where he is the chairman and general manager. One of his colleagues, Rowland James, was also a friend from the Roman battlefield. At that time, he was a captain in charge of military broadcasting. He often boasted about his wife in Italy.</p>
<p>His wife, Mamo, was a female star with considerable status in Hollywood more than ten years ago, and knew many inside stories about the film industry. She often lamented to herself: "When one gets old, everything is useless!" She said: The golden age of movie stars is too short, they are all afraid of getting old, and they are also afraid of getting old! She said: Most of the stars spend lavishly during their golden age, and there are those who can accumulate money and become rich, but relatively few.</p>
<p>The Rowland couple drove me around the entire city of Greater Los Angeles. We started from Olive Avenue in the oldest developed part of the city, all the way to the Roosevelt Highway on the Pacific coast, passing over several hills and slopes. All along the way there were exquisite residences. The owners of these residences included movie stars, high-ranking military officers, and wealthy merchants and big buyers. Mrs. Rowland pointed out to me a row of neat residences on the back of Beverly Hills, along the Pacific coast, saying: "These are all Mary Davies' real estate." Then, she added: "You probably haven't heard of her, a red star from more than ten years ago!"</p>
<p>Beverly Hills Back - Movie Star "Concentration Camp"</p>
<p>Beverly Hills is behind Hollywood. Looking at the map, it is in the western part of Los Angeles. That is the "concentration camp" for beauties, the residential area for first-class movie stars. The day after I arrived in Los Angeles, I took a tour bus from a travel company to leisurely tour Hollywood. On the way from Hollywood to Beverly Hills, there were all kinds of "nightclubs." The tour guide said: This one? Those few, those few stars often come and go here. Many nightclubs are run by stars who have "retired and returned to their hometowns." Although they have retired from service, they still live in Hollywood, relying on the warriors of the next generation.</p>
<p>On Beverly Hills, I saw the residences of Tyrone Power and Loretta Young. I remember that Tyrone Power's (the pillar of 20th Century Fox) residence was opposite Gary Cooper's. There is a corner on Beverly Hills called "Musical Corner," where there is a three-way intersection, and three big singers live on the three corners: Deanna Durbin, Nelson Eddy, and Ilona Massey.</p>
<p>These people are all well-known figures in Hollywood. In their world, they are the darlings of fortune. All the American news reporters stationed in Hollywood track their every word and deed, and publish them in the so-called Hollywood columns of various newspapers. Hollywood people still talk with great relish about Shirley Temple's grand and majestic wedding.</p>
<p>Lead's Salary - $500 US Per Week</p>
<p>In reality, those who are truly called red stars are, comparatively speaking, very few. In the movie world, there is no standard for the income of red stars. Some have long-term contracts with companies, and some are paid on a per-film basis. I visited several companies (to be introduced in another article). I know that 20th Century Fox has about seventy or eighty people with long-term contracts with the so-called first-class red stars. Warner Bros. has about sixty people, and Columbia Pictures has fewer.</p>
<p>In addition to the featured red stars, film actors can also be divided into four levels: leads, supporting roles, speaking actors, and extras. Those who have considerable skills, those who are proficient in dancing, singing, and swimming, can be lead actors. The salary of a lead actor is at least $500 per week. The salary of a supporting actor is between $250 and $1,000 (per week). There are very few long-term contracts. The so-called speaking actors and extras are recruited on a temporary basis. Those who can open their mouths and say one or two irrelevant sentences are one level higher than extras who are purely "running errands." Speaking actors can earn $25 to $100 per day, and extras are prescribed $16.50 per day.</p>
<p>It Takes About One Hundred Days to Make a Film</p>
<p>I asked producers from several film companies, and their answers were almost the same: the time required to complete a film is twelve to fourteen weeks, unless there are unavoidable circumstances as exceptions. Extras must be on set every day during the filmmaking process, because there are many details that must be reshot, two or three times, or even more than ten times!</p>
<p>Extras are required to work six days a week, eight hours a day. If the factory needs overtime work beyond eight hours in order to catch up with the work, the factory will pay compensation at one and a half times the original wage. John Ford, an employee of 20th Century Fox who accompanied me on the tour, told me: there is very little photography at night. The night scenes on the screen are all faked with lights.</p>
<p>Agents - Powerful Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>The most incredible thing is the "agents" of film actors. These people are the most authoritative behind-the-scenes figures in Hollywood. Their "great power" amazed me. Through their palms, red actors can turn black, and young, inexperienced youngsters can become famous overnight.</p>
<p>From the top red stars to the sixteen-dollar-fifty extras, almost everyone who appears on the screen and makes a living by acting in movies has his agent. When the factory wants to make a film and needs so many people and roles, they first notify their agents. The agents, like organizing a cabinet, submit a list within a few days, and then the producer considers, compares, and selects from many lists. The list rarely adopts a uniform approach, and mostly adopts a "mixed cabinet" approach.</p>
<p>Many top red stars like to sign long-term contracts. Signing long-term contracts must also go through agents. The agents discuss with the boss, and bargain with the stars. They run between the boss and the actors, taking a fraction of the commission. These agents are all top-notch talents. They have "connections" and "methods." In Hollywood, they are all-powerful!</p>
<p>Actors Guild - Also an Authoritative Organization</p>
<p>In addition to agents, there is also the "Actors Guild," which is also an authoritative organization. If you want to gain a foothold in Hollywood, it is absolutely impossible without the support of the guild. The membership fee for actors, regardless of size, is one hundred dollars, and the annual membership fee is eighteen dollars. It is said that applying to join the guild is a rather difficult thing. It is the gateway to entering the Hollywood professional circle!</p>
<p>The guild is currently suspending the recruitment of any new members, because they feel that there are already too many actors in Hollywood now (especially extras). This is the strictest way to exclude "newcomers." However, if it is a truly newly discovered "genius," or a "buried beauty" discovered by a film company's big boss, that kind of person still has no problem.</p>
<p>Mysterious? Agents, guilds, this is the inside of Hollywood. Peeling off Hollywood's coat, and seeing through its behind-the-scenes dynamics, that is truly mysterious!</p>

<p>White Lotus Creek Vegetable Vendors Call for Help</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>In the past, we were a group of workers from nearby factories. After August 13th, the factories shut down. To make a living, we had to borrow small amounts of capital and sell vegetables within the designated area of Lane 158, Bailianjing Road, under the jurisdiction of the police station. Unexpectedly, last winter, a local man, Jiang Helin, raised funds to build a simple shed as a commercial vegetable market, hoping to make a big profit. We were unanimously dissatisfied at the time, and local impartial people helped us to voice our opposition, so it did not happen. Recently, Jiang Helin has made a comeback and is trying to force us to sell inside the market through various channels. However, we believe that it is illegal for Jiang Helin to charge us rent for the shed, so we firmly oppose it and are unwilling to enter the market, resisting the wealthy who want to profit from the poor. Therefore, we appeal to all impartial people for assistance. (Forced vegetable vendors Cai Miaogen, etc.)</p>
<h3>Revival of the Sulfuric Acid Industry</h3>
<p>— Tianjin, 22nd (Airmail Dispatch) Our Correspondent Li Shaolin</p>
<p>The production of sulfuric acid indicates the degree of industrialization of a country. According to estimates in 1931, the annual sulfuric acid production of modern countries in the world at that time was almost seven million to ten million tons. In our country, apart from a few arsenals that had acid-making equipment for their own needs, other industrial acids were almost entirely dominated by Japanese companies. A large amount of sulfuric acid was shipped from Japan, earning profits five times or more, directly and indirectly exploiting Chinese industry and destroying Chinese industry.</p>
<p>Lizhong Acid Plant - Establishment Process</p>
<p>In 1932, through the efforts of Mr. Zhao Yanqiu, Tianjin Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Company was announced to be established. The Chemical Engineering Research Institute of Nankai University presided over the entire design work. Finally, in 1934, Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Plant's domestically produced sulfuric acid came into being. This was not a miracle. It was merely the result of the efforts of many people with perseverance and vision. Japanese people would not allow this emerging Chinese industry to develop. Therefore, after Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Plant began to ship goods, Japanese companies immediately launched an offensive. At that time, the North China sulfuric acid market was entirely controlled by the three Japanese companies, Daqing, Shimizu, and Jinshan. They first used low-priced dumping to put tremendous pressure on Lizhong Acid Plant. Each box of Japanese-produced sulfuric acid, weighing 200 pounds, originally sold for 70 or 80 yuan. In order to defeat Lizhong, Japanese merchants crazily lowered the price to 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and even to their possible lowest price of 12 or 13 yuan per box. The raw materials used by Lizhong were originally purchased from Guangdong, Yingde, Spain, and other places, with high cost prices. Under the joint attack of Japanese companies, it almost reached the point where it could not be sustained.</p>
<p>Repeated Sabotage - Japanese Merchants Fail Miserably</p>
<p>At the most difficult stage, Lizhong's chief engineer Jiang Zidan discovered that the sulfuric acid stone picked out from the Kaiquan Coal Mine could be used as raw material, which was discarded at Kaiquan. After this research was successful, the cost per box for Lizhong was reduced to 7 yuan. Therefore, Lizhong launched the most violent counterattack against Japanese merchants. At this time, the Japanese came up with another trick to strike at Lizhong, pointing out the white smoke coming from Lizhong's chimney, finding fault with it, saying that it contained sulfur trioxide and was harmful to the respiratory organs of Tianjin people, and forcing the plant to shut down. After hearing the news, Nankai University President Zhang Boling sent Nankai chemical experts to Lizhong by car. He said: "Today is like fighting a war. The enemy has attacked our doorstep. If we cannot remove the white smoke, we cannot leave!" As a result of research and improvement, no more white smoke was seen in the chimney. The Japanese did not give up on this. They also smuggled sulfuric acid from Qinhuangdao to North China, but Lizhong more quickly lowered the price of its products and sold them to the market. After several years of struggle, the Japanese sulfuric acid market in North China finally collapsed. As a result, the steel mills, wire nail factories, and enamel factories operated by the Japanese in Tianjin at that time could not but rely on Lizhong to supply sulfuric acid. The Japanese regarded Lizhong as very magical and twice requested to visit Lizhong, but both requests were rejected.</p>
<p>Expand Business - Prepare for Branch Plant</p>
<p>Lizhong's daily production volume was only over three tons. For Shandong's annual need of 1,500 tons, it could only supply 700 tons at that time. In 1936, Lizhong discovered that the sulfur stone produced in Boshan was even better in composition than Kaiquan's. In 1937, it purchased 50 mu of land outside the North Gate of Jinan to prepare for the establishment of a branch plant, with a planned daily production of 20 tons. It was in the planning and construction phase when the July 7th Incident occurred, and the plan for the Jinan branch plant was suspended. The Tianjin main plant was also taken over by the Japanese. From when Lizhong shipped goods in 1934 to the outbreak of the war of resistance in 1937, the total production of sulfuric acid was over 3,000 tons, recovering a loss of 2 million yuan at that time and maintaining the livelihoods of over 1,200 people at that time.</p>
<p>Repair and Resume Work - Supply Needs</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Yanqiu came to Tianjin from the rear in the autumn of 1946. After several months of hard work, he recovered the factory from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. He also appealed to all parties for loans and repaired the dilapidated equipment. Now the factory has started shipping goods again, and the output is close to the pre-war output, producing over three tons per day. What he regretted most at that time was that Chief Engineer Jiang Yuzan had died in Tianjin in 1942. Lizhong Sulfuric Acid uses the lead chamber method. The equipment in the factory has a total of 14 ore furnaces. After the ferrous sulfide is burned in a furnace, it passes through the storage and settling chamber to the Ge Tower, nitric acid is added, and then it passes through three lead chambers for continuous heating to increase the concentration and eliminate impurities to obtain sulfuric acid. The concentration of sulfuric acid produced is 66 degrees Baumé. Regarding the story of the "white smoke," after improved treatment, the gas produced after heating the ferrous sulfide must pass through four smoke collection devices. The inside of the smoke collection tower is made of ceramic tiles to condense the gas into liquid. After passing through the cooler, it passes through a smoke collection box filled with coke, so that the white smoke adheres to the coke. Finally, it is discharged through the neutralization tower and white chimney. Now, in addition to sulfuric acid, Lizhong also produces over a thousand pounds of nitric acid per day. In addition to its own use, it has already ordered over 200 million yuan of nitric acid, while sulfuric acid has ordered over 400 million yuan.</p>
<p>After the victory, the Japanese left us three sulfuric acid plants. There is one plant each in Fushun and Anshan, but the damage is severe and there is no hope of repair. In addition, there is a plant in Huludao, which was designed by a German engineer hired by the Japanese. It is now operated by the Resource Committee Chemical Company. The equipment is designed to produce 100 tons per day, but it has not yet shipped any goods. It is expected to produce 50 tons after resuming production. The Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Company in Shanghai has also not been repaired to this day. At present, Lizhong is the only plant responsible for supplying domestic industrial needs. Lizhong has been revived, and China's acid-making industry has also been revived.</p>

<h3>Serious Flooding in Guangdong and Guangxi; Hong Kong Busy with Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong, 25th Dispatch by Airmail. Special Correspondent, Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The extent of the flooding in Guangdong and Guangxi this time is unprecedented in a century. Over forty counties in Guangdong Province have been affected. In Guangxi Province, among its ninety-two counties, fifty have been hit by the disaster. In Huiyang, Guangdong, the water level reached twenty-eight feet, affecting more than 200,000 people. Thousands of houses were destroyed, and the number of deaths of people and livestock is impossible to count. The rest, including Heyuan, Boluo, Gaoyao, Zhongshan, Luoding, Yinan, Qingyuan, Sihui, Dongguan, Xinfeng, Nanhai, Sanshui, Longmen, Yingde, Heshan, Huaxian, Conghua, Zengcheng, and Deqing, have all suffered severely. The harvest is hopeless. Although there are no detailed disaster reports from Guangxi Province, the severity of the situation is self-evident.</p>
<p>Since receiving news of the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, the people of Hong Kong immediately launched a fundraising campaign for disaster relief. They organized the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Community Joint Relief Fund for the Guangdong-Guangxi Floods," and began soliciting donations everywhere. The Guangdong Flood Emergency Relief Association sent three committee members, Lin Yizhong, Wu Zhimei, and Luo Jiqun, to Shanghai to appeal for help. At the same time, the Hong Kong Relief Fund, led by Xu Jiliang, chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, sent representatives to Guangzhou to discuss the allocation of relief funds in detail. These days, the entire city of Hong Kong is busy helping the dead and injured. The amount of money raised has already reached nearly HK$300,000. The Gold and Silver Exchange Market has contributed the most, donating HK$150,000. Mr. Hu Wenhu donated a total of more than HK$40,000 in cash and medicine. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company also donated HK$30,000 on its own. The China Overseas Chinese Daily launched a charity sale and raised more than HK$10,000 in one day. Now restaurants, tea houses, hawkers, etc., are holding charity sales, and theaters and troupes are holding charity performances. Students across Hong Kong have launched a campaign to raise HK$5 per person. The total amount of donations is expected to reach HK$500,000 (approximately 500,000 yuan in national currency).</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of relief, all sectors have also discussed at one time. To avoid embezzlement and ensure that the victims can truly benefit, it is planned that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Gold and Silver Exchange Market will organize a supervisory relief team to assist the provincial government in distributing relief. The spirit of Hong Kong people's own drowning, enthusiastic disaster relief, is really rare.</p>
<h3>Hissing Sounds from the Shenyang Locomotive Factory</h3>
<p>— Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch by Airmail. Special Correspondent, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>The Northeast is in a state of great destruction and ruin! Here is a report about a healthy and praiseworthy "Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant." Seeing its role, we feel the importance of the Northeast, and we must not allow it to suffer destruction and ruin again.</p>
<p>It is a zone near the scenic areas of "Beiling" and "Tawan," with several factories covering a large area. Smoke rises, and from afar, you can hear a continuous ding-dong sound. That is the "Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant," located in Huanggu District, Shenyang.</p>
<p>It is a unit of the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in Shenyang, and also a large factory in the Tiexi and Huanggu industrial zones of Shenyang that can emit smoke from a few chimneys today.</p>
<p>This is a main factory, including four plants: locomotives, rolling stock, forging and casting, and repair and maintenance. In addition, there are "Tiexi Factory" and "Shenyang Automobile Factory" in Shenyang, and two factories in other locations: "Anshan Factory" and "Andong Automobile Factory."</p>
<p>"SASAC Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Co., Ltd." is located in</p>
<p>the main factory. The general manager is Liu Shizhan, and the associate manager is Cao Wen. The company has five departments: general affairs, business, design, engineering, and finance. In addition, there are the factories and various plants.</p>
<p>Having taken over the main factory for a year, the work is not as satisfactory as ideal due to the impact of power and capital shortages. However, with the efforts of all employees, there have been hard-won gains. They manufactured eight 147-ton large locomotives, three 15-ton small locomotives, repaired eleven large and small locomotives, and manufactured 161 freight cars. They also repaired 16 passenger and freight cars, all of which are the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the Chinese people themselves.</p>
<p>These manufactured and repaired vehicles have been supplied to the "Northeast Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications," "Fuxin Coal Mine," "Beipiao Coal Mine," "Yanhe Coal," "Xi'an Coal Mine," "Benxi Coal and Iron Company," "Anshan Iron and Steel Company," "Liaoning Cement Company," and "Taiwan Sugar Corporation" for use.</p>
<p>The production quantity scheduled for the entire year of 1947 is as follows: manufacturing twelve 147-ton large locomotives, twenty 15-ton small locomotives, and 600 freight cars; repairing thirty large locomotives and 200 freight cars. Currently, the cost of a large locomotive is approximately 2.5 billion yuan in national currency. An American locomotive costs approximately US$120,000 to US$140,000, which, calculated at the black market rate, is only half the price in national currency.</p>
<p>The total weight of a large locomotive is 103.4 metric tons, and the required man-hours are 6,451. There is forging, casting, drilling, welding, and all kinds of technical work. The man-hours of the special factories are not included.</p>
<p>To manufacture a large locomotive, only the air brakes, boiler tubes, and tire rings purchased from abroad need to be assembled before it can be fired up and leave the factory. Except for the boiler tubes, all parts for the small locomotive can be manufactured in the Northeast. This is because the incomplete factories in the Northeast are currently unable to produce air brakes, boiler tubes, and tire rings.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>materials used to manufacture freight cars, apart from wood, cotton yarn, and paint, are supplied by the following units: steel materials, wheel axles, hooks, springs, malleable iron, screws, rivets, air pipes, axle oil, copper, lead, zinc, and other direct materials; oxygen, calcium carbide welding rods, electrical materials, bituminous coal, coke, and other indirect materials; all supplied by the SASAC's Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Shenyang Machine Factory, Shenyang Chemical Factory, Shenyang Rubber Factory, Fushun Mining Bureau, Fuxin Coal Mining Company, Benxi Coal and Iron Company, Northeast Metal Mining Company, and Shenyang Electrical Factory, forming an inseparable whole.</p>
<p>The inability to solve all the difficult problems in the Northeast has been blamed on transportation. At the steel conference, the success or failure of reviewing various plans for Anshan depends on transportation, and the difficulty of transportation is due to insufficient vehicles. The Shenyang Locomotive Factory's Third Product: New Locomotive No. 5 (Reviewed by Special Correspondent Han Qingtao)</p>
<p>In 1944, during the enemy and puppet occupation era, the Northeast Railway had a total of 2,376 locomotives and 41,741 freight cars, with annual freight traffic reaching 33 billion ton-kilometers, transporting approximately 70 million tons of goods.</p>
<p>According to a survey in January 1947, the Northeast had taken over 600 locomotives and 5,400 freight cars. Among them, 1,400 belonged to the North China Railway. These meager assets are subject to great destruction. We see the hard work of driving each nail into the locomotive, and the workers layer by layer of mining, we also see the painful scene of locomotives overturning on damaged bridges or turning into scrap iron with a loud crash.</p>
<p>The main materials required by the locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plant are steel from Anshan and coal from Fushun and Fuxin. Materials from Jilin. Currently, wood is mostly in the Communist-controlled areas, making it difficult to obtain. Steel and coking coal are also restricted by transportation.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the</p>
<p>electricity problem. The Xiaofengman power line has been cut off. Apart from the piecemeal supply of electricity from the Power Bureau every day, the factory uses locomotives as the driving force to generate 4 million watts of electricity. However, it is still far from solving the entire problem.</p>
<p>Important materials that must be purchased from abroad have been approved by various government councils for US$400,000, and are being ordered abroad and will arrive successively.</p>
<p>The company's five-year expansion plan has been submitted by the SASAC to the Supreme Economic Council. If the Dalian plant (manufacturing small locomotives) is also taken over, then after five years, the annual output can reach 200 locomotives, 200 passenger cars, and 4,000 freight cars.</p>
<p>The historical record of the locomotive and rolling stock factory is as follows: When the Japanese militarists' continental policy poured into the Northeast in 1938, there was a "deep-rooted" trend. The Japanese "Akiyama Masahachi" and "Manchuria Railway" successively raised 30 million yen to establish "Manchuria Rolling Stock Co., Ltd." Construction began in May 1939, engaging in the manufacture of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars.</p>
<p>In 1942, 599 freight cars were manufactured. In 1944, 41 locomotives were manufactured. It is said that this was affected by wartime labor and materials, and theoretically only reached half of the production.</p>
<p>After the Northeast was recovered, the Soviet army arrived in Shenyang and took over the factory. For some reason, they dismissed our workers, leaving the Japanese and Soviet employees to maintain the repair work.</p>
<p>When the Soviet army withdrew, they did not have time to dismantle and relocate, and only managed to move 75 important machines. Although this greatly damaged the vitality, there was still something that could be done.</p>
<p>At the end of March 1946, the National Army stationed in Shenyang, and the relevant departments</p>
<p>took over the factory. In May, it was renamed "Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Economic Affairs." The Japanese were dismissed, and our workers were recruited. At the beginning of June, 100 kilowatts of electricity were obtained, and work began. By the end of September, the first locomotive rolled off the assembly line, and 15 freight cars were also manufactured, and two old locomotives were repaired.</p>
<p>On October 1, it was renamed its current name, and production began according to plan. June 19 marked the first anniversary of their resumption of work.</p>
<p>The industry in the Northeast is a whole, and the manufacturing of vehicles for transportation is an important</p>
<p>link in all industries. We must fully exploit its power and seek the coordination of the entire Northeast industry. Every link must be tight and cannot be loosened.</p>
<p>The importance of the Northeast lies first in the establishment of light and heavy industries. Although they are now dilapidated, the low production volume and equipment are still impressive and rare in the country. Steel, minerals, and factories have all established a good scale and laid the foundation.</p>
<p>Today, efforts are being made to gradually restore the old appearance, but the only condition is stability and construction. Otherwise, everything will be over. To illustrate with facts, the Northeast Communist Army launched the fifth offensive, and the war spread. The "China Textile Company" alone suffered losses of more than one trillion yuan in legal tender in various places.</p>
<p>The flames of war destroyed the industrial and mining production in the Northeast. According to Chen Gongliang, special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in the Northeast, "The tax revenue in the Northeast was mainly based on the commodity tax on factory and mine products in various places, but due to the power outage, the coal output of Fushun decreased, and most factories in various places were shut down, resulting in a sharp reduction in tax revenue. If the situation does not improve, the future of tax revenue is quite bleak." What a painful report.</p>
<p>The recovery of industry and mining in the Northeast cannot be interrupted in the middle, let alone destroyed. Otherwise, not only will all previous efforts be wasted, but there may be no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Hearing the roar of the locomotives leaving the factory is exciting and makes people feel a lot of emotions!</p>

<h3>Editorial Notes</h3>
<p>— Wang Jinshan</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Today, I must first express my personal gratitude and apology to friends in the literary and artistic circles for this publication. I would also like to say a few words to readers who care about this publication.</p>
<p>I have been involved in the editing and proofreading work of this publication for exactly ten months today. Although the time is not too long, I have edited more than 290 issues. If I were a woman and conceived on the day I took over the editing, there should be a baby born today. However, what can I offer today in return for the expectations of friends and readers? To be honest, I just returned from the rear last year, and it was during the recovery period. I had already lost contact with the literary and artistic circles, and even the nature of this publication was a bit vague, so I was just groping around during those four months. As for the six months of this year, although the internal affairs have entered the initial stage of constitutional government, the war has not ended, the country is in difficulty, the people's livelihood is difficult, and the literary and artistic circles are facing an era of misfortune. I am afraid that even subscribing to the newspaper is already a considerable burden for readers.</p>
<p>Although this publication has consulted writers and readers for their opinions from time to time in the past, hoping to work towards everyone's ideals, it has also received instructions and support from many people who are enthusiastic about this publication. Although some of them have been barely accomplished, due to the editor's energy and talent, the valuable instructions have not been fully implemented, and the active support has not been maximized. Even letters from friends cannot be answered in time, and good manuscripts are inevitably shelved for no reason. This is also the reason why it is worth reviewing and saying a few words of nonsense at the end of the half-year today.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Initially, because of the contract, I still taught a few hours at a university in Nanjing. Until this spring—in fact, people who live a nightlife don't know much about spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Several times I went to the station and saw that there were more and more passengers, and they were all wearing spring clothes in pairs. Only then did I realize that spring had arrived, and my train tickets became even more difficult to buy. I had no choice but to ask a friend to take my class.</p>
<p>At this time, I thought that I might be able to spare some time to draw pictures and write manuscripts in the future. Who knew that time was not as leisurely as I imagined, and there would be more trivial matters and annoyances when I was free. Even just sorting out the manuscripts took up as much time as possible. Although I have not worked as a professional editor for a long time before, I have done amateur editing work sporadically for more than ten years. And because I often write and paint myself, I understand the joys and sorrows of writing, so I have an even more devoted heart to cherish other people's works, and I am never willing to spoil other people's minds casually. Once an article is decided to be used, I have to sort it out from the title, paragraphs, sentences, words, and vulgar words, cursive script, typos, etc., along with punctuation marks. Then I plan the format of the layout, the position on the page, etc. And the page I dance on is not fixed. Not only do I have to consider the style of the articles published a few days before and after today's typesetting, so as not to be the same; I also need to pay attention to the matching between the articles published on the same day. I need to seek unity in change and maintain harmony in complexity. The energy spent in this process is far from what writers and readers can imagine. So I can't help but often think of Goethe's words and add endless sadness. When he recalled the situation of co-editing publications with Schiller in 1824, he advised his friends not to be editors, saying:</p>
<p>"Schiller and I spent so much time editing "Die Horen" and "Musenalmanach"; I have recently read our letters and understood everything. I always feel annoyed when I think about that attempt…"</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Wang Tongzhao also talked about the difficulty of editing work when he edited "Wenxue," saying:</p>
<p>"In terms of theory, it should be a rich knowledge, the ability to identify articles, and even more need carefulness and patience. This is not enough, and it must also be accompanied by the ability to cope with the environment."</p>
<p>Indeed, smart people have already been promoted and made a fortune in this era, and editing work is definitely not something that smart people do. For the editor personally, especially those who have a writing habit, it is at least a waste of energy. But then again, if everyone became a smart person, and there were no fools to reflect the smartness of smart people, it would be quite monotonous.</p>
<p>Whenever I was overwhelmed by trivial matters and the hustle and bustle of life, although there were friends who cared for me and advised me not to be too serious, I believed that how could a person who devoted himself to literary and artistic career be confused?</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many brilliant editors who possess the talent of heaven and do not need to worry about this.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Every dusk, the street lights are dim, and sometimes it is inevitable that there is rain and snow. I carry a roll of manuscripts alone from my residence—because I am not used to using a briefcase, I used to wrap it in a piece of kraft paper before March of this year. One day, a friend who cared about me, and also a reader of this publication, discovered it, and gave me a finely crafted and sturdy portfolio-style leather bag that I had used a few times when I was studying at university. This is how I got a more suitable tool. I put the manuscripts received every day in it and took them home late at night, and the next evening I put the selected and edited manuscripts in it and carried them out. I walked a distance, caught a tram, or called a pedicab.</p>
<p>At this time, I can't help but often think that although literature and art are the education of emotions and the history of the human soul, can this career be of any benefit to others? Does this chaotic era need such a relatively fresh spiritual food? Apart from giving readers appreciation and joy, can the purpose of literature and art really make people know a little about the true meaning of society and life? People who read the newspaper understand the social actions of this generation from the news and telegrams. Can they understand the brilliance of the souls of this generation from the supplements? - What kind of reflection does this publication evoke in the hearts of readers?</p>
<p>Although I watched the branches and leaves of the trees along the way wither and then flourish again, and the leather bag I carried with the manuscripts was subjected to frost, dew, wind, and rain every night, it gradually appeared a bit old and was about to break down. I stroked it and could not help but sink into the depths of thought; I was at a loss, just like the street lights, blindly hanging in the silent streets.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>There are many things that move me very much, and thinking about them is like countless powerful whips whipping me; especially the encouragement and praise from friends.</p>
<p>I personally heard several middle school students tell me that their Chinese teacher publicly introduced this publication in class as extracurricular reading material for students; occasionally, they also selected and printed articles published in this publication as Chinese teaching materials. The student bulletin board of a certain school also often copies and reprints short articles from this publication. As for readers selecting a few articles or illustrations to cut out and paste at any time, or saving the entire page, I heard that there are many; I also often receive letters requesting to check previous supplements. There were also several readers who wrote to me, asking to leave the white paper on the left side of the newspaper supplement wider so that they could bind it. Of course, some people have suggested compiling and printing a single book. But these things are not easy to do at this time.</p>
<p>I often think that based on the daily sales of 150,000 copies of this newspaper, with five to ten readers per copy, there are more than 750,000 readers every day. If a hollow or weak manuscript is published, or a word is printed wrong, it will be blamed by more than 750,000 readers. Therefore, it makes people feel even more cautious.</p>
<p>Of course, colleagues in every part of the newspaper, from the editorial department to the typesetting room, often give me a lot of guidance and assistance. What needs to be explained is that this publication is still far from the ideal standard, and it is obvious that not enough effort has been made. This apology revolves in my heart all the time, and I will not shirk this responsibility. But I have to tell the writers and readers these situations frankly. And I hope that submissions can take into account the difficulties of the editor in a negative way, and help this publication enrich its content and improve its standards in a positive way. I also hope to firmly grasp the literary and artistic nature, the lasting sentiment, and the serious style of this publication. Let's cultivate, till, and irrigate together, so that the literary and artistic garden that is attacked by wind and rain day and night can still bloom a beautiful and wonderful flower. - This is everyone's ideal.</p>
<p>I don't want to say much about the nature of this publication today. In short, creative translations of literary and artistic departments, as well as research reports, and literary and artistic memorial texts with time significance are all welcome. And what is needed most recently are short stories of less than 3,000 words, literary theories of 1,000 to 2,000 words, essays and miscellanies of around 1,000 words, and short literary articles of less than 100 words. The rest have already been published in the solicitation rules, so I will not go into detail.</p>
<p>The so-called timelessness is just a kind of flavor in an article, lively as flowing water, crystal clear as a stone, elegant as distant mountains outside the window, vigorous as old pines on the top of a peak, and close to feelings and reason, kind and tasty. This kind of article can make people think after reading it, and read it again after thinking about it. From the opposite point of view, it is to avoid unnecessary branches and leaves, avoid being rigid and crude, and avoid being far from real life. The Greek critic Dionysius criticized Plato's writing style, saying:</p>
<p>"His writing style can be seen everywhere as bright and transparent, as if it were clear spring water, and it is particularly accurate and wonderful. He only uses ordinary words, strives to be clear, and does not add embellishments. His classical words are antique, showing a kind of joyful charm, beautiful and powerful, like a gust of gentle wind blowing from a fragrant meadow…"</p>
<p>I also often think that no matter what the content or what style of writing, even if it is not a literary work, it should give readers a kind of aesthetic feeling of words; let alone articles published in literary publications?</p>
<p>The meaning of seriousness here is only in terms of the choice of theme, the perspective of material selection, and the ability of writing. This is not a moralistic style that is forced out with a long face, but on the contrary, the so-called "sages do not forbid what cannot be avoided by human feelings"; however, it is not necessarily possible to make a literary work out of a full page of romanticism and a sad mood. Works use true words to express life, and naturally they must be full of human touch. If you can treat the article itself as a work of art, you must work as hard as creating a work of art when writing, and not indulge your own skills, modify and delete; after the first draft is written, they have the same important value. I can say unceremoniously that I often boldly embellish many submissions before sending them out for typesetting. I also often receive many letters requesting to modify manuscripts, but unfortunately I have not done it well due to time constraints, which is also a very regrettable thing. - Therefore, I can only sincerely hope that writers with a long history of writing will often contribute excellent works to serve as examples.</p>
<p>At the time when the summer vacation is starting in various schools and a long summer is coming, everyone's life may be a little more relaxed. Therefore, I would like to ask the literature teachers of major middle schools, the students of the literature departments, and friends in the literary and artistic circles to give this publication more guidance and assistance, and to write a few solid and beautiful articles and send them to this publication: the editor is here waiting with eager feelings!</p>
<h3>The Heavenly Music</h3>
<p>— Rossetti</p>
<p>Rossetti (D.G. Rossetti 1828-1882) was originally Italian, but because he grew up in England, many historians classified his paintings in the English school.</p>
<p>He not only had a high talent for painting, but also had literary cultivation, and could write poetry and beautiful articles. He was the leader of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</p>
<p>The characteristics of his works are rich in meditation, illusion, romance and literary meaning. Representative works include "Dante's Dream," "Daydream," and "The Heavenly Music," etc. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Beethoven and "Force"</h3>
<p>— Shadow</p>
<p>Among the great musicians who shake people's hearts, I prefer Beethoven to Mozart, Bach, Chopin, and others. This is not only because of his heroic force (Romain Rolland said he was "the embodiment of force") but also because of his noble and aloof character. Mr. Fu Lei said it well in his article "Beethoven's Works and His Spirit":</p>
<p>"To affirm this 'self,' to liberate the individual before emperors and nobles, to make them recognize that each individual is an emperor and noble, or that each emperor and noble is a commoner, one must affirm 'force,' cultivate it, nurture it, bring it forth, and concretely express it, so that people cannot but accept it. Every free 'self' wants to command. If he cannot command in action, at least he can command in art. If he cannot conquer kingdoms like Napoleon, at least he must conquer hearts and emotions, like Beethoven. Yes, Beethoven and force, this is a natural topic." (Beethoven's Biography, page 110)</p>
<p>Many of Beethoven's pieces are his venting of force, his declaration of force. He had his motto: "Force is the morality of those who are different from ordinary people, and it is my morality." However, despite this, he did not fall into the quagmire of Nietzschean supermanism. Nietzsche's expression of "force" is to try to lift oneself up by one's hair to ascend, to break away from the mediocrity and soar freely; Beethoven is not like that. He used his talent to teach mankind that they should use "force" to resist and conquer suffering and fate; and they should use "force" to encourage and passionately love their brothers. In the "Missa Solemnis," he appealed on behalf of humble mankind and sang for the sufferers; in the "Ninth Symphony," he wanted to liberate and expand people from pain and struggle. In this way—</p>
<p>"As a result of liberation and expansion, man and divinity approach each other, uniting with divinity. At that time, force is God, man is force, there is no good or evil, no conflict, and the duality of force disappears." (See Beethoven's Biography)</p>
<p>This admirer of "force" actually had a spirit higher than "force" restraining him, and that was his character. He was deaf, so he was accompanied by the immortal "eternity"; his rugged life was not enough to prove the tragedy of his career, but instead showed the irrationality of this world. In his life, he was constantly fighting against vulgarity, physically, circumstantially, and spiritually... at the same time, he was wielding his weapons on several fronts, but he never failed. No, even in such a battle, he was constantly boasting courage to the poor human beings. Every song of his can be regarded as a "declaration of force." He once wrote to his nephew: "Our era" needs powerful minds to whip these poor crowds." Please do not think this is his arrogance; precisely because his wise eyes saw through the despicable and insidious scenes of the human world, precisely because his whole body was filled with the spirit of struggle, he said such words with the ambition of a saint.</p>
<p>In a letter to the pianist Czerny, he said:</p>
<p>"When your students play the piano with proper fingering, accurate rhythm, and fairly harmonious notes, you only need to pay attention to the style, do not interrupt him for small mistakes, but wait until the end of the piece to tell him. — This method can cultivate a "musician," and this is the first thing in musical art."</p>
<p>The training of skills is one thing, and the cultivation of the mind is another. Beethoven paid more attention to the latter. Please see the "musician" mentioned in the above letter. Why did Beethoven emphasize it so much? — His meaning is not equal to saying: It is a musician! Definitely not a musical artisan!</p>
<h3>A Century-Long Plan—Hopes for the Preparatory Office of the Art Museum</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Chinese painting flourished in the Tang Dynasty, reached its peak in the Song Dynasty, changed in the Yuan Dynasty, diverged in the Ming Dynasty, and declined in the Qing Dynasty. It has increasingly deteriorated, with each generation being inferior to the previous one. In the past hundred years, the art scene has been in mourning and chaos, which has long been sighed upon by insightful people. In addition, the import of Western painting has brought both internal and external troubles, further hindering the development of Chinese painting. Now, at the beginning of the preparation for the Shanghai Art Museum, it is planned to hold an exhibition of paintings from the past century as a preliminary step to promote research, gradually improving like eating sugarcane upside down, so that viewers are shocked by the decline of the modern art scene and recall the magnificent achievements of the Tang and Song Dynasties. This will revive and reform the art scene and strive to promote the movement of literary and artistic revival. This is a great event.</p>
<p>To cure a disease, one must first examine its source. Modern painting suffers from a variety of ailments, the root of which lies far back in the early Qing Dynasty and more recently in the late Qing Dynasty. To understand why modern painting is as it is, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review of painting in the past century, find the root cause of the disease, and take remedial measures before it is too late, so as not to run the risk of administering the wrong medicine.</p>
<p>In a village of ten households, there must be honest and trustworthy people; in a century, how could there be no outstanding talents? If we can collect a wealth of works and compare them, then the flaws and merits will be visible, the jade and the stone will be distinguished, and there may even be outstanding works that have been overlooked, which, once discovered, will surely be a surprising discovery.</p>
<p>Painting in the past century is actually the father of modern painting. Although the father has failed to carry on the family tradition and promote it, his contribution to connecting the past and the future cannot be obliterated. However, the era limits people, and the environment limits people. Even if there are extraordinary talents and abilities, they cannot transcend the era and break through the environment. If we had been born seventy or eighty years earlier, we would probably only absorb the remnants of the Four Wangs, and our achievements would not necessarily surpass Lu Lianfu. If we were at the same time as Ren Bonian, we might not be immune to his influence and become a follower of the Shanghai School. Extreme prosperity must be followed by decline, which is a natural law. In this time of decline, even with great effort, it is impossible to reverse the trend. To lightly despise and dismiss it with a single stroke is not fair. We should not belittle the ancients and love the moderns. Without the ancients, there would be no moderns, and without the moderns, how can we continue the legacy of the ancients!</p>
<p>What I hope for from the preparatory office of the art museum is not only to hold exhibitions of various eras, but also to have the government allocate sufficient funds to purchase and collect masterpieces from past generations and display them regularly. Although we cannot be as complete as the museums and galleries of France, Britain, and Italy, we must at least rival the Palace Museum in Beijing and serve as a general collection of Chinese art. This century-long plan is just the beginning.</p>
<h3>Thinking of My Deceased Friend Teng Ruoquan by Moonlight</h3>
<p>— Yu Xinwu</p>
<p>Too much emotion shortens one's youth, let alone a talent like you. Alas, the world is shaky and declining (Ruoquan was in Yunnan, and he was often unhappy. He once wrote a poem about decline and sent it to Qian Binxin). The articles are uniquely crafted. The brocade and silk are only dreams of the past. The zither and se are played with sorrow (You and your wife were not harmonious). The night is beautiful tonight. Where is my old friend?</p>
<h3>Life Span Has an End</h3>
<p>— Yu Xinwu</p>
<p>Life span has an end, and heaven and earth have a limit; only this spiritual realm is vast and intangible; hanging in the air for tens of thousands of generations, everything, big and small, is reduced to dust; the universe is originally vast, but it is fragmented here; alas, empty prince, annihilation is the end.</p>
<h3>Summer Day</h3>
<p>— Hu Yingdong</p>
<p>The intense sunlight pours down on the earth, and the earth sighs under the sunlight. The ocean breeze carries the heat, blowing towards this bustling city in gusts. The commotion in this city is more urgent than before. Watching the flow of people and vehicles and the flying dust, I involuntarily feel a sense of suffocation and fatigue surging in my heart.</p>
<p>Summer, a scorching season, brings city dwellers sweat for life, the invasion of epidemics, and the threat of heat and light...</p>
<p>I wander the streets on a summer day, carrying a scorching sun, walking forward numbly and mechanically. "Where are you going?" My answer is to go to the slaughterhouse of life to exchange for a ration; in silence, I mean that this hot season is indispensable for depression and panting.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>The summer in the city has an extremely uncoordinated aspect. It stretches between people like a deep ravine. If you are a tourist in this city, you can see the poor sweating cheaply, eking out a living on the edge of death and hunger, while the children of the rich comfortably stay in air-conditioned restaurants, singing and dancing sweetly.</p>
<p>Hot weather is a threat to the poor, but for the rich, it has a charming sentiment built on money.</p>
<p>Some people regard midsummer as a cruel tyrant, ruling the creatures on the earth, distilling the common people until they are scorched with its intense light. When people smell his footsteps, who does not curse him from the bottom of their hearts!</p>
<p>Facing the scorching fire, the barren wind and sand, dragging a dried-up skin to pass this dull day, I desperately fell into a nightmare, dreaming of a desert-like world, dreaming of the fierce face of the sun god, dreaming of him pouring down the oppressive heat.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>So the cowardly poets are trembling, the shameless are singing, the clowns are hiding in the cool pavilions to escape, and the earth is plunged into dead silence.</p>
<p>Looking at this long, long night, I feel that my fantasy is powerless?</p>
<h3>Shield</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhi</p>
<p>In the museum, I saw a shield.</p>
<p>The shield aroused my deep thoughts...</p>
<p>Through this shield, I saw the ancient heroes - holding a long spear in one hand and a shield in the other, passing through thousands of troops and tens of thousands of horses, invincible wherever they went.</p>
<p>Through this shield, I saw the ancient war - the general riding on horseback, the soldiers holding crossbows, blindly shooting in a mess. The two generals met, the drums kept beating, the two horses crossed, the spear and shield, the knife and gun, mixed into a large piece...</p>
<p>Let's touch it, this shield that has experienced vicissitudes!</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt...</p>
<p>Why use a shield? Why not shoot back an arrow at those who shoot me? Why not stab back with a spear at those who stab me? But use a shield to block it?</p>
<p>True heroes do not need shields. Those who use shields are not true heroes.</p>
<p>True heroes use arrows to shoot to death those who shoot me. True heroes use spears to stab to death those who stab me.</p>
<p>The shield is the weapon of cowards. It is the carapace of the weak, the amulet of fools.</p>
<p>True heroes do not need shields; those who use shields are not true heroes.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Solitary Mooring</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>I think that when a person's appearance is most still, it is often when his heart is most disturbed. Because when a certain aspect of emotion cannot be vented, one has to pretend to be calm to stabilize oneself. That is, to return to one's own world - to hide in memories.</p>
<p>I also believe that the sum of the life enjoyed by each person will not be too different, but each person has a different percentage of what he or she takes.</p>
<p>This difference in the importance of taking or giving can be used to explain the difference in the value of each person's life.</p>
<p>If every energy that exists in the present world can be discovered sequentially and can be fully utilized for favorable use, then it is too ideal.</p>
<p>The progress of things is really too fast. The rope of spiritual civilization cannot be fastened tightly, and it cannot even hold the world of atoms. I am worried that due to a momentary mistake by someone, the prosperity of mankind will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu said: "Knowing the constant is called clarity." "Constant" can be interpreted as "nature." In other words, Lao Tzu means: "Understanding nature is clarity." And so-called understanding, of course, refers to knowing how to use the power of nature.</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing can be said to be the consumption of force.</p>
<p>L said: "Whenever two forces collide, they will stagnate; just like the crowding at the entrance of the amusement park, no one will be able to pass."</p>
<p>From this, I couldn't help but raise a series of associations about reality.</p>
<p>Or it can be interpreted like this! The entrance to that amusement park is narrow. However, if you can use more reason, abandon selfishness, and in an orderly manner, everyone can walk through that door.</p>
<p>However, selfishness has trapped us.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes About Ruan Ji—Miscellaneous Discussions on Wei and Jin Figures, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leng</p>
<p>In terms of self-preservation, Ruan Ji seems to be better than Ji Kang. This is not to judge the ancients by success or failure, with one being executed and the other being able to live to the end of his life. I mean that Ji Kang can only achieve passive defense in his feigned madness by tolerating humiliation and concealing flaws and not speaking ill of others, while Ruan Ji can go a step further, embodying satire in his licentiousness, attacking the hidden pain of the powerful, and also knowing when to restrain himself, so as not to give others a handle.</p>
<p>Jin Shu 49, Biography of Ruan Ji:</p>
<p>"Ji originally had ambitions to save the world, but in the Wei and Jin dynasties, the world was in turmoil, and few famous scholars were able to preserve themselves. Ji therefore did not participate in worldly affairs and became addicted to drinking. When Emperor Wen first wanted to propose marriage to Ji for Emperor Wu, Ji was drunk for sixty days and could not speak to stop it. Zhong Hui repeatedly asked him about current affairs, wanting to use his approval or disapproval to bring him to justice, but he was always spared because of his drunkenness."</p>
<p>In such a harsh environment, the timid would either have surrendered or been too frightened to speak. However, no, Ruan Ji was not only not afraid at all, but he went his own way, using white eyes to criticize the scholars of etiquette, and he also wrote a biography of a great man, really mocking these great men:</p>
<p>"The so-called gentlemen of the world only follow the law and adhere to etiquette, holding jade tablets in their hands and walking on the straight and narrow. They are praised by their fellow villagers when they are young and are known to neighboring countries when they grow up. They want to become one of the three dukes in the court and will not lose their position as the governor of Kyushu. But have you not seen the lice in the trousers, escaping into the deep seams, hiding in the worn-out cotton, thinking that it is a good home? They dare not leave the seams when they walk and dare not leave the crotch when they move, thinking that they are following the rules, but when the flames flow and the city is burned, the lice in the trousers cannot get out. Is the gentleman's place in the world any different from the lice's place in the trousers?"</p>
<p>Using lice to describe great men may be a bit inappropriate, but the shortcomings he pointed out of the great men, stubbornly maintaining the status quo, blindly respecting the legal system, and unconditionally supporting it regardless of whether it is right or wrong, and considering reform and progress as rebellion and not thinking about making progress, even if it is used to compare today's scholars and celebrities, it is not necessarily inappropriate.</p>
<p>Ruan Ji's dissatisfaction with reality is not only seen in this passage, but also in his repeated actions of crying bitterly at the end of the road. In my opinion, it was also inspired by his feelings and was not just due to his licentious nerves. Because those who have great talents but cannot develop them either become decadent or become extreme. So he wrote a song: "The sun sets in the west of Buzhou, the moon rises in the middle of Danyuan, the essence of the sun is hidden, and the light of the yin replaces it. The pavilion stops for a moment, and it will soon recover. Wealth and honor are in a flash, why must poverty and lowliness end?" It shows: "The sun has set, the moon has risen, the light is gone, and darkness is spreading, but this is a temporary thing, and soon it will return to its original state. At that time, I can fully express my ambition and will no longer be frustrated." Look, what a sad and angry and positive poem!</p>
<p>Jin Zhi: "Ji once climbed Guangwu and watched the battlefields of Chu and Han, sighing: There were no heroes at that time, so that the boys could gain fame. He climbed Mount Wulao and looked at the capital and sighed, and then wrote a poem about heroes." On the one hand, he was drunk, and on the other hand, he wrote poems about heroes. The thoughts in his heart were mixed with complaints and melancholy. He had to avoid the harm of powerful officials and feared that he would end up unknown. The most contradictory and painful thing in the world is probably this!</p>
<h3>Tragedy of New York Housing Shortage</h3>
<p>— Gan Lai</p>
<p>Housing rental disputes in this city inevitably exceed several each day. The housing shortage problem is apparently very serious. Not long ago, this city even saw a tragedy in which a sublessor beat and injured a tenant when demanding they vacate.</p>
<p>But, unexpectedly, even New York, with its title as "world capital," also has a housing shortage, and a shockingly tragic event occurred:</p>
<p>The complete truth is below:</p>
<p>"Mr. Shawl, 50 years old, was an accountant for the United States Shipping Company during the war. After the war, he was laid off and unemployed. He married Ms. Daisy Newson during the war. The couple's relationship was initially very good. A few months ago, his wife invited her older sister and niece to live with them in their small room. Because of this, the couple often argued. Three months ago, the couple fought with each other and were mediated by the police, who were called to the scene, and the matter subsided. At 2:00 p.m. on May 19, while his wife and niece were out, the couple started arguing again. Mr. Shawl actually stabbed his wife in the abdomen with a knife, causing her to bleed profusely. She stumbled out of the room seeking help. Mr. Shawl then stabbed himself inside the room in an attempt to commit suicide. Both husband and wife suffered serious abdominal injuries and their lives were in danger. In a semi-comatose state, Mr. Shawl said to the police, "I wish to die. What is there to love in life anymore?""</p>

<h3>A Pale Minstrel—In Memory of Liu Baoquan</h3>
<p>— Si Kong Wuji</p>
<p>Baoquan's son, receiving the education of "upper-class people," learned how to curry favor. Excelling in studies, he changed careers to become an official, which is the best business. Baoquan's son prospered.</p>
<p>"What kind of sight are you, showing your face outside like that? Don't do it again tomorrow!" This is the command of the official son to his father, who sings drum ballads. Is this the class obedience that people call for today?</p>
<p>Baoquan accepted his son's words, "Yes, it's time to save face for my son. It's time to enjoy a few years of happiness." Actually, he didn't care about his son's tone. He secretly pondered. Actually, Baoquan returned to his son's mansion, and one more old servant was added to his son's mansion; he was nicknamed Old Master.</p>
<p>"From now on, you are not allowed to smoke opium!"</p>
<p>"Why are you so lazy?"</p>
<p>All were commands and torments.</p>
<p>That was exactly the age of Baoquan in his fifties. All hope was shattered. He finally left the mansion and returned to the drum platform.</p>
<p>This huge stimulus increased his sadness for the world. At the beginning of the drumbeat, he accompanied his story, sometimes happy and sometimes angry, enriching the life of the drum lyrics with natural emotions. He gave people so much sorrow and joy... Although, what he talked about was nothing more than the loyal and filial martyrs of the former dynasty... However, there were also some incalculable blood and tears hidden in it.</p>
<p>Baoquan's health was not very good, and he was getting old. However, in order to make a living, he could only struggle hard. The old hope followed that filial son. Suddenly one day, the owner of Liu's mansion in Tianjin held a celebration for his birthday and sent people to Beijing to invite actors. Inevitably, he invited this drum king. With a generous reward, Baoquan arrived in Tianjin. On the day of the celebration, there was a constant stream of traffic and horses. Baoquan served a section of Hengwu Pass on the stage, winning applause from the whole audience. The host gave a reward, and Baoquan kowtowed to thank the host for his kindness. When he stood up and looked up, he realized that the dignified Lord Liu sitting above was his son.</p>
<p>The silver-haired performer fell down, spitting out a mouthful of blood, and fainted on the ground.</p>
<p>Poor people should not get sick. Sickness makes the poor even poorer. Baoquan's life back in Beijing was even more miserable. And his inner loneliness was even greater than his life's pain. He could not endure hunger, and he could not endure loneliness even more.</p>
<p>--He, this silver-haired, coiled, and clear-faced old performer, stepped onto the drum platform again.</p>
<p>Decades of effort, talent plus tempering, and, more importantly, a desolate life experience and a heart full of love for his family and country. All were poured into every word and every gesture of Baoquan.</p>
<p>The hearts of the audience were all subdued by the desolate, high-pitched, and sometimes slightly hoarse voice.</p>
<p>The drumbeat stopped, and the sound of the clapper faded. This silver-haired performer shook his head like the spiritual light of the Lu Palace, slowly lowering his body, as if giving a salute, and calmly put down the drum hammer. The dream woke up, and the audience forced their eyes to look at the empty stage. They looked at each other, smiled; sadly but pleasantly. Then, they squeezed each other, and noisily squeezed out of the narrow door of the courtyard.</p>
<p>Where was the silver-haired drummer? In the back, he was sipping tea and coughing. Then, dragging his staggering steps, he returned to his broken house.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance broke out. This drum king, who was called Little Baoquan in his youth, was now in his twilight years, and his body was even weaker. Under the brutal atmosphere of the enemy and the puppet regime in Beijing, Zai Wang still exhausted his last voice, shaking and telling the stories of loyal and filial martyrs of the former dynasty.</p>
<p>Like a ripe fruit bidding farewell to the branches, this performer—no, it would be more appropriate to call him a master! I don't know if he left this world very peacefully? Or very desolate?</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>This story was told to me by a deceased old actor. I did not dare to add any embellishments.</p>
<p>The reason why I wrote this essay is to express my personal incomparable respect for this artistic master. (End)</p>

<h3>The Science of Dreams (I)</h3>
<p>— Gu Junzheng</p>
<p>Everyone dreams. Some people think they don't dream, but it's actually because they forget them as soon as they have them. There has always been a kind of superstition about dreams, but what is said below is the conclusion reached by scientists after long-term research.</p>
<p>How do dreams come about?</p>
<p>Our mind can be divided into two parts, inner and outer. The outer part is conscious, and the inner part is subconscious. Our desires, fears, frustrations, and wishes are all deeply hidden in the subconscious. When you dream, the barrier between the inner and outer consciousness is relaxed, so your conscious mind can see what is going on in your subconscious mind. This is a dream.</p>
<p>This varies from person to person. Sometimes it is slightly different, sometimes it is completely different. If the personality of the person in your dream is not much different from when you are awake, it means that your psychology is very healthy and your personality is flawless. However, if the person you are in your dream is completely different from when you are awake, it indicates that you have a tendency to have a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>What types of dreams are there?</p>
<p>The famous British psychologist Dr. E. Graham Howe has found that all dreams can be classified into the following categories:</p>
<p>(1) Dreams of satisfying desires, such as children dreaming of fancy toys, adults dreaming of money, or dreaming of the death of people they don't like.</p>
<p>(2) Dreams of longing, such as dreamers missing the train, climbing bottomless pits, etc. This type of dream indicates the failure of a certain endeavor.</p>
<p>(3) Purposeful dreams, which solve a problem or simulate the steps of an action.</p>
<p>(4) Self-critical dreams, which reveal the shortcomings of the dreamer himself.</p>
<p>(5) Reproduction dreams, in which the dreamer replays the daytime experience.</p>
<h3>Assorted Notes from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Tu</p>
<p>Bizarre Occurrences in the Presidential Election</p>
<p>When Roosevelt was running for his fourth term as president, his evenly matched opponent was Thomas Dewey, the governor of New York. The Democratic and Republican parties had roughly the same number of members. Dewey's party members were spread across the United States, but some states were entirely Democratic strongholds, while others were entirely Republican. Newspapers within their respective spheres of influence spoke with one voice, specializing in attacking the opposing party, criticizing private matters, and even delving into personal morality. Several newspapers run by Dewey's people dedicated entire issues to listing Roosevelt's wrongdoings, enumerating hundreds of types of exorbitant taxes. They even listed charitable donations as exorbitant taxes, truly embodying the saying, "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a charge." Roosevelt had a secret organization that collected ten thousand dollars from anyone who joined as a member. Those who joined as members had to pay a membership fee of ten thousand dollars, with the understanding that they would share in the benefits if the election was successful. Since American parties do not explicitly stipulate the collection of party dues, this ten thousand dollar membership fee was indispensable. Furthermore, by spending ten thousand US dollars in membership fees, those who supported the leader into office would all secure important positions, either as cabinet ministers, provincial governors, or city mayors. A mere ten thousand dollar offering was not excessive. Roosevelt's side was more generous and did not specialize in attacking Dewey. Roosevelt also never gave campaign speeches. Dewey not only gave speeches every day but also published his photos in newspapers and issued countless "Vote Dewey" pin badges. I am not an American, and I have no right to vote. I was grateful when people from Dewey's party gave me a pin badge and pleaded with me to wear it on my uniform. In the end, I wore a Roosevelt pin badge. A few days before the election, Roosevelt's eldest son, Colonel Roosevelt, was sued by a soldier for airlifting his pet dog. Dewey seized the opportunity and attacked Roosevelt mercilessly. The new wife of Roosevelt's eldest son was a Hollywood movie star. Although her private life was somewhat romantic, she also suffered as a result, with scandals spreading everywhere and newspapers reprinting them. In the end, Roosevelt still won, and Dewey lost out on his scheming plans. It is said that he plans to compete with Marshall and Eisenhower next time. (6)</p>
<h3>Gleanings from Manchu Officials' Memorials</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>My maternal great-grandfather, Duke Wensun, loved collecting rubbings of metal and stone inscriptions. After the Republic of China was established, he served in the Beijing Court of Justice, and his collections became even more numerous. When I was a child, I often visited my maternal family and was able to glimpse some of them. Among them were several memorials from Manchu officials. I have recorded those that were particularly witty and flavorful to refresh the weary. One was from an official named Jinlu, who signed himself as "Your Slave," and it roughly stated: "Your slave has heard that in the south of China, there is a great country called Japan. Japan is the origin of the sun..." Following this was an imperial edict from Empress Dowager Cixi, which stated: "Since it is said to be the origin of the sun, it is undoubtedly to the east of China. This official has falsely claimed it to be in the south, which shows that he has read little geography and is unlearned. He is ordered to attend lectures on geography at the Imperial Clan Court once a day." Another memorial, the name of which I have forgotten, roughly stated: "Your slave compares the compassionate thoughts of the Buddha-like Old Lord and worries that it is due to Li Hongzhang's signing of treaties. Your slave believes that Taiwan originally belonged to a desolate place, long estranged from royal civilization, overgrown with weeds and thorns, where rice and grains do not grow. Their customs involve cutting hair and tattooing the body, and their people are naturally wicked and rebellious. Therefore, the rebel Zheng used them to stir up trouble in the marshland, and the rebel Zhu relied on them to jump and frolic in foreign lands. Even if Yao and Shun were reborn, they would be placed among the Four Fiends. Now, fortunately, the Heavenly Japanese kingdom does not ask for anything else but seeks Taiwan. It is fitting to grant them what they desire and cede it to them. Your slave privately predicts that after several years, Taiwan will indulge in their desires day by day, and the Japanese kingdom will be unable to bear their disturbances. When they are locked in a clam-shell struggle, we can seize it with one drumbeat." Following this was also an imperial edict from Empress Dowager Cixi, with beautiful and pleasing calligraphy that stated: "Within the land, there is no land that is not the king's land; under the heavens, there is no subject who is not the king's subject. The court is anxiously concerned about the uneasy borders and is waiting for an opportunity to take action. This official cannot guide the ruler to be like Yao and Shun, but uses twisted words to curry favor. What is his intention?" Looking at the two memorials in general, they are laughable. However, the comments made by the two [Empresses] still have some insight, which shows that Empress Dowager Cixi was not a mediocre ruler. However, she was overbearing, scheming, and narrow-minded. It is fitting to discuss her virtues and not her ministers.</p>
