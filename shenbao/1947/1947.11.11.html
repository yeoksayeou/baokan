<h3>總裁指示黨員工作集中精力動員救民　克盡職責勿以競選為榮</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕蔣總裁十日上午九時主持中央黨部總理紀念週，行禮後，對於本黨黨員之責任及參加選舉問題，經作簡單之指示，略謂：「目前共匪尙未戡平，民困尙朱解除，主義尙未實現，本黨同志應時刻念及自身革命責任之禾盡，全副心力應集中於挽救國家危難，解除人民疾苦方面之工作。本人迭據國軍收復地區被害民衆之泣訴，與前方官兵耳聞目擊者之報吿，現在匪軍之暴行及匪區人民生活痛苦之實情實非吾人安處後方者所能想像於萬一，在匪區內凡五十八歲以下，十八歲以上之壯丁，一律被脅迫爲「民兵」，以補充匪部，平時並不訓練，戰時只令其衝鋒送死，此等壯丁，一經被編爲「民兵」，明知更無三個月生存之希望，然在其欺騙與殘酷壓迫之下，何能倖免，惟覺後悔無及而已，故魯中膠東國軍所至，數百里內，往往絕無人烟。最近河南及各地大中學校教授及學生家屬之在匪區者，爲匪軍「淸算」，「鬥爭」所遭刑罰，慘無天日，除將其父兄子弟盡淪爲「民兵」之外，更將其妹女淪入匪軍「慰勞隊一，各種寡廉鮮恥，荼毒蹂躪之慘狀，尤非言語所能形容。余可斷言，此種滅絕人性之共匪，如不迅速剿滅，則三年以後，華北各省將靡有孒遺矣。本黨負有實行主義，建設國家，拯救同胞之責任，今當共匪猖　，國家民族遭此浩刼，一般黨員同志，惟有集中精力，努力奮鬥，不惜犧牲，不辭勞苦，乃能戡平大亂，拯救人民，除剿匪戡亂工作之外，一切個人榮譽地位，此時皆不應計較，免致分散目標，削减力量，故余對於選舉問題，以爲本黨同志除由本黨決定列入參加競選者外，其他皆當專心戮力於戡亂動員之工作，以期對剿匪軍事有所貢獻，尤其是黨政軍各部門負實際責任之同志，更應以先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂的精神，專心致力於本身職務，不僅不以當選爲榮，且須知此時參加競選而放棄革命黨員之職責，乃爲革命黨員之恥辱，俾可多留若干名額，使友黨人士與社會賢達多得參加政治之機會。吾人須知，行憲與戡亂，同等重要，而戡亂實爲行憲之始基，吾人應多盡革命責任，不爭個人權利，如此始能表現本黨同志爲國爲民至公至誠之精神，亦始能完成本黨實行主義建設國家之使命。</p>
<h3>國靑兩黨國大代表候選人名單　僑胞選舉府令變通辦理</h3>
<p>（本報南京十日電）國民黨，靑年黨國代候選人名單，業經選總於十日下午六時公布。民社黨名單因尙在洽商中，未及同時公布。國民黨全部名單共一千七百五十八名，包括各項候選人，二十二省，十市，五特種團體，靑年黨全部計二百八十八人，二十省，七市，四特種團體。選總即晚以電報直接通知各省縣選所，同時發出快郵代電，通知此項公布之名單。又今日公布之名單包括各省市，各職團，惟尙有綏靖區及海外華僑部份之名單不包括在内。台灣省部份，國民黨係採自由競選辦法，靑年黨則提出候選人三名，業於今日同時公布。（國民黨名單見刋版，靑年黨名單見三版左角。）</p>
<p>（本報南京十日電）民社黨國代候選人名單迄未商妥，吳鐵城在滬與張君勸折衝，亦未獲結論。該黨王世憲十日晨自滬抵京，旋與徐傅霖，楊浚明訪陳立夫，交換意見。晚陳立夫，鄭彥棻復訪徐，然幾度往返商談，終未獲得結論。</p>
<h3>蔣勻田携名單晋京堅持人數二六〇名　雷震與蔣氏同行</h3>
<p>（中央社本市訊）民社黨繼續堅持該黨過去所擬人數爲二百六十名之國大代表候選人名單，原名單已由蔣勻田氏於十日晚携京一。蔣氏行前對記者稱，「此次在京協商結果，本黨所提名單人數，自二六〇名被遞减爲二九〇名，並將本黨若干重要人負剔除，本黨內部迭經商討，認爲斷難接受，故決定仍以原名單提交，如若仍不能通過，則本黨惟有退出選舉」。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕據悉，自國民黨交還民社黨前所提名單請再考慮，並經決定增讓民社黨候選人十五名後，該黨仍堅持若干地區尙有「重要份子」卅餘名必須列爲候選人。國民黨方面則認爲在此等地區已提出之候選人，均屬優秀黨員，故表示不能再讓，但已允讓出之若干地區，而民社黨則答謂無適當人選可爲候選人。據可靠方面獲悉：民社黨方面經國民黨安排之候選人。已有一百九十一名，其餘未足名額並已允在綏靖區補足。，但民社黨仍堅持其應再加三十餘名之要求，致幾經商談，迄未獲協議。</p>
<h3>國民黨發言人談助友黨競選</h3>
<p>〔又電〕國民黨發言談稱：「國民黨此次提出之名單，係經過縣級陳報，省級審核，自下而上之程序，最後經中央鄭重決定，手續繁重，頗費時日。本黨候選人以便利友黨候選人之競選，幾於每一地區均須反覆商討，始可獲致適當解決。國民黨此次提出名單中有一特點，即其中包括於各地各業之同志，勢必因此减少其參加競選之機會。此種重視國家利益犧性小我之精神，應爲國人所讚許。本黨總裁，將分別予以嘉勉，以崇讓德。」</p>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕選總主席委員張厲生於十日晚六時在選總於公布國民黨·靑年黨國代候選人名單後，接見記者，發表談話稱：政府對各地辦理選舉有三點希望；　建立良好秩序，　貫澈政府法令，　表達人民意思。各選務機關如能對此三點希望均做到，則選舉投票當可順利進行，達成民主之選舉。張氏復稱：今日公布國，靑兩黨名單，係　送到者先行公布，以後續有送到者，當陸續發表。</p>
<p>張氏又稱：根據選舉法之規定，非經登記及合法簽署者，不得爲候選人，非候選人不得參加競選。現除政黨提名部份外，截至目前爲止，各地合法提名者，尙有二萬人之多。職業團體依法登記者，截至目前止亦有萬人左右</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕關於僑居國外同胞選舉事，由於種種困難，僑務委員會刻奉國府命令指示變通辦法，如僑胞居留地，可以依法辦理選舉者，即行依法辦理，否則暫緩舉行。</p>
<p>東北嚴寒長吉滴水成泳</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十日電〕東北天氣大寒，長吉滴水成冰，瀋陽降至零下三度，寒風刺骨，各綫戰事頗受天氣影響，惟並無因此停歇希望。</p>
<h3>對德和會程序問題　我外部發表聲明　如無我政府同意不得視爲有效</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕關於報載蘇聯代表在倫敦四外長代理人會議席上，反對英·法·美所提議中國應同爲對德和會召集人一事，外部爲答復記者詢問，十日晚特發表下列聲明：「中國政府於本年十一月五日，曾將其迭次所聲明關於召開對德和會之立塲重行通知英·法·美·蘇四國，中國認爲歐洲各項和約之起草工作，雖經波茨坦協定指定由簽字於投降條款之諸國擔任，但和會之如何組織及應由何國召集，則從未授權外長會議中之任何一部份會員自行處理，故應由全體外長會議共同決定。中國政府對此事之立塲，一向皆爲英·法·美所支持，足徵其公正合理，中國以外長會發一份子之資格，堅持必須參預關於對德和會一切程序問題之決定，任何決議如無中國政府之同意，不得視爲有效。</p>
<h3>瀋北克法庫康平石家莊國軍堅守</h3>

<p>〔本報北平十日電〕石家莊保衛戰昨再渡過慘烈之一夜，共匪六次猛撲，皆被擊退，空軍澈夜出動，在匪軍陣地上空投照明彈，並投彈掃射，數處大火，匪砲兵陣地全被炸毀，九日晚延續出動，機數仍在二百架以上。關係方面推測，共匪攻勢今夜將達最高潮。軍息：正定守軍昨撤守，元氏仍被圍攻，戰鬥酷烈。另息：平津保三角地大淸河南岸頃已集結共匪萬餘，有渡河竄擾企圖，徐水西南亦有一部移近鐵路錢。綜觀以上情勢，共匪似有發動牽制石莊方面攻勢之企圖。</p>
<p>〔又電〕孫連仲及空軍第二軍區司令徐康良，前昨均曾親飛石莊上空視察，石市內動員五十萬一人，協助防衛。空軍今日在平山至石莊路上發現共匪滿戰補給之馬車三百餘輛，當炸毀二百餘輛</p>

<h3>馬卿定布經濟援華　草擬確切建議俾提交國會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：馬歇爾國務卿十日在兩院外委會中，除請求國會在三月三十一日以前以五九七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元緊急援助歐洲外，並宣布正在擬定「一個經濟援助中國」之確切建議，以使早日提出。馬卿此語，係答復共和黨各　袖之質詢，彼等要求將中國列入任何臨時之援助計劃內。馬卿之報吿，大部份雖均係涉及歐洲問題，但强調稱：「中國之局勢，繼續使我人深切關注，我人應對其政府與人民予以若干經濟援助及協助」。馬卿又謂：「美國及其他世界各强國均承認蔣主席之國民政府爲中國唯一合法政府」。按比爲美國政府主要人員就美國對華政策之第一次表示。</p>
<p>關於中國部份，馬歇爾之報告全文如次：「中國之局勢，繼續促使我人深切關心。內戰擴大並愈趨猛烈，中國共黨利用武器，企圖統治中國廣泛之地區。美國及全世界各强國，均承認中國國民政府為中國唯一合法政府。祇有中國政府及有民始能解決其基本問題，並為中國重獲其應得地位，使其成爲遠東方面之主要穩定勢力」。然則我人仍能予以協助，同時，　於我人與中國之悠久不斷友好及合作紀錄，我人應對中國人民與政府，予以若干經濟之援助。一個確切之議案，正在擬定中，以便早日提出。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十日廣播：華盛頓訊，馬歇爾在對兩院外委會之演詞中，對干援助中國之計劃，在數量與時間方面均未有肯定之說明，惟副國務卿洛維特告紀者謂：渠對援華建議將向國會特會提出一點，表示懷疑。洛氏表示，援華計劃將包括短期之援助。</p>

<h3>所望於善後事业委員會者　—幸勿再蹈聯總與行總的覆轍—</h3>
<p>行將接辦聯總與行總結束後宋了事宜的善後事業委負會，其組織條例已由立法院通過，同時聯總署長魯克斯將軍於　華返國前　記者稱：「關於聯總行總　濟事業，將於本年十二月三十一日結束，結束後善後救濟工作，除由中國政府成立善後事業委員會外，並由中國官員，社會賢達，外籍人員等三方面各推五人，另行成立　　保管委員會共同　　負責，所有聯總行總結束後之剩餘救濟物資，大部份將移交善後事業委員會，一部份如漁船及漁業器材則出售民營，至行總公路大隊及水運大　即將與行總同時結束，空運大隊則尙未決定。」可見聯合國在華救濟事業，還要中國政府來辦善後。</p>
<p>中國行政上最大的毛病是每一部門祇　縱的系統而不　作橫的聯繫。因了祇　縱的系統，所屬事業便成包　萬象的現象，而在整個的系統，就是　　床架屋之嫌；因了不願作橫的聯　，各部門間便多無謂的摩擦和糾紛，而在行政效率上，就不免有浪費人力與物力之弊。即就聯總與行總的行政與業務而說，他們工作的範　，應該在乎救濟物資的分配，而他們却偏要把物資的運用也由他們自己來辦理。例如：　汎區的復興工作　可交由水利部支配而由聯總或行總與之商定原則；漁業，機耕，農具製造，鄉村工業示範等工作，儘可交由農林部負責辦理，而由聯總或行總分派專家指導；物資的運輸和倉儲　可委由招商局公路總局鐵路管理局航空公司等辦理，而由聯總或行總加强其設備。乃聯總與行　不此之圖，偏要把各種　業後頭至尾一手包辦，結果究竟如何呢？現　結束的當兒，我們把他們過去的成績來檢討一下，便可找到種種事實足以證明：　　的聯　太差，不但沒有得到合作的效果，而且發生無謂的糾紛，許多物資因而不能充分利用。　所辦事業太形　　，且無統盤計劃，許多臨時性的事業，因了本身的結束而致前功　素。　就比例而言，行政經費多於管理經費，管理經　又多於事業經費，雖有些　成績，總覺代價太高。　客物太多。許多事業往往弄成喧賓奪主的情形，使得事業的推進受了　肘。如果聯總與行總在成立時候，能够考慮到現在的後果而有良好的組織與合理的範圍，其所得成績，必不止於此！</p>
<p>「前事不忘，後事之師。」當此善後事業委員會與聯總　行總行將新舊交替之際，　者用敢指陳週去的弊端而寄望於將　就組織而言：善後事業委員會以外，尙有　議保管委員會共同負責，參照過去的組織，　議保管委員會之於善後事業委員會，似乎聯總之與行總的關係，參照事業機關的組織，又似乎是公司的　監會。立法諸君如果認爲有此必要，也應使這個　議保管委員會僅居於核定執行原則的地位，不應如魯克斯將軍所說的「共　負責」，使馱行人員有「一國三公」之感。須知多方牽制是行政上最大的障　；希　　後事業換了湯也要換了藥　好。　就行政而言：我們要求以最低的人力物力獲得　的效果，尤其是善後救濟事業，無論經費的來源怎樣，提高一分行政效率，即爲事業多得一分成效，雀下一分錢，即使社會多得一分救濟。所謂尙未分配的就濟物　務要從速分配完　，勿再任其堆在倉庫麥　　；各地分　的未了事宜應即移交當地政府代爲分別辦理，勿再另立機構以加　行政費用的負擔；客　們應留則留，可去即去，勿再任其投　置散，從耗救濟費用，而反讓他們抱怨。　就事業而言：凡是永久性的事業與其他各部門所主管的事業，善後事業委員會就不必辦。因爲魯克斯將軍所　　的「其他如漁管區之漁船及漁業器材，除留小部份設立小型漁業公司及有關之　頭廠修理廠外，大部份些將陸　出售民營」的計劃，實有重行考慮之必要。其他如公路隊，水　大隊，空運大隊等等也統應迅即移交交通部所屬的業務機構接辦，不必在結束之後另設機構以分散國家的人力物力。總之，善後事業委員會旣以繼續辦理救濟物資的分配，其工作即應以分配爲對象，至於如何運用，若僅加以善意的指導，便能收事半功倍之效，那又何必統由自己經營呢？</p>
<p>我們行政效率能否提高，當於此次善後事業委員會的改組卜之。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十日廣播：馬歇爾國務卿今在兩院外交委員會中致辭，請求國會在明年三月三十一日以前以五億九千七百萬美元充作緊急援助歐洲之用。渠估計在三月卅一日以後之十五個月，將再需七十億美元。復興歐洲之長期費用，將在一百六十億與二百億之問。馬卿稱：「使歐洲恢復其健康，乃主要强國之目標（蘇聯除外）。」馬卿以直率之語調聲明：「爲其本身之理由，蘇聯並不與我人同樣的具有此一目標。」馬歇爾對於援歐長期費用之估計，校諸哈里曼委員會之報吿爲高。按哈里曼委員會對四年計劃之估計爲一百七十億美元。馬卿謂目前無法估計準確之數字，但為「眞正」應付法，義，奧三國之緊急需要，五億九千七百萬美元之臨時援助實爲必要。馬卿續稱：緊急時期過去後，自三月三十一日以迄財政年度六月三十日共需十五億美元，而七月一日起之一整年中，又需六十億美元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十日廣播：華盛頓訊，馬歇爾在演詞中認爲歐洲之局勞嚴重，美國必須迅速以援助給予歐洲。渠云經濟援助並不能保證「自動成功」，但「余認爲成功之希望甚大」。對於蘇方所稱馬歇爾計劃之目的乃在控制歐洲一點，馬氏力加否認，聲稱此項計劃決無邪惡之用意，其宗旨乃在協助外國之生產建設，並不威脅任何一國。渠云美國之援助應採取贈與及借貸兩種方式。馬氏首次正式透露受惠各國應提供若干保證，即此項援助應用以獲得經濟之復蘇，愈速愈佳。對於穩定經濟，發展生產（尤以煤斤與食物爲最重要）及减低貿易壁壘尤須致力。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕兩院外委會之　席會議不擬於今日向馬歇爾提出問題，俟馬歇爾報吿畢，兩委員會即將個別開會，決定聆取各方面意見之程序，此一階段之工作歷時約需一週，內閣要員若副國務卿洛維特，農長安特森，財長史奈德，商長哈里曼，均將蒞會陳述意見。國會全體會於十一月十七日召開時，杜魯門總統且將親自蒞臨發表關於對外援助及對內遏阻通貨膨脹之計劃。美政府及有經歷之國會人士皆料國會對於救急援助計劃，不致有重大反對，對於援助數額雖將縝密考慮，惟無論如何此一過渡援助計劃必可於聖誕節前通過。至於馬歇爾之長期援歐計劃，除在數額上或有商榷外，此外亦不致有所阻礙。</p>
<h3>民主黨領袖康納利主張　援歐不另設機構　由國務院直接監督執行</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕參院外委會民主黨領袖康納利今日宣稱，援外法案應由國務院直接監督執行，任命監督　人，經由國務院向杜魯門總統提出報吿。康氏此言足以代表政府觀點，與共和黨要求另設機構主持其事一節互相鑿柄。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十日電〕此間非正式方面咸傳有兩人可能出任世界最重大之職務，即馬歇爾方案之總管理，呼聲最高者爲前參議員拉福萊特，渠乃建議設立此職及其他有關援歐方案建議案之報吿書之起草人。另一人被關係方面認爲可能而適宜祖任此職者，為現任駐英大使陶格拉斯。</p>
<h3>哈里曼報吿　歐洲反應良好</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕美國之哈里曼委員會硏究馬歇爾方案之報吿書發表後，歐洲各地反饗大致均表歡迎，茲分誌如下：　法國：政府人士均具好感，惟共黨則繼續抨擊；　丹麥：政界對援助數額之减少，表示驚異，但覺終較沒有援助爲佳；　義大利：左翼報紙對該報吿極少注意，其餘各報則均大事鼓吹；　荷蘭：財長李夫丁克稱：援歐額减少之後，苟不嚴格管制工資及物價，則歐洲之通貨膨脹將不能避免；　希臘：副總理蔡爾達理斯稱：馬歇爾方案愈早實施，歐洲可愈早獲得自由與安全；　捷克：唯一發表評論之報僅陸軍報紙「李多報」一家，謂該報吿意在重建德國工業，盲目反對共產主義。</p>
<h3>暹羅不流血政變成功　阿斐璜組織新閣　將頒布新憲法恢復國王權力</h3>
<p>〔聯合社曼谷十日電〕一九四四年與四六年兩度出任總理之阿斐璜，今日已被任命爲遷羅內閣新總理，並由前攝政王察納，前國民議會議畏塞維，及阿杜爾將軍，亞隆柯與希耶字德中將等五人，組織樞密會議，主持國務。國王浦密蓬下月可自瑞士返國，樞密會議已立即頒佈憲法，恢復國王在一九三二年被奪之一部權力。該項新憲法係前總理兼駐美大使普拉莫所起草，依照新憲法規定，　國會將續採兩院制，但上院議員改歸國王任命而非民選，新總理將宣佈閣員名單。</p>
<h3>國際共產情報局　下月召開首次會</h3>
<p>〔路透社華沙九日電〕據權威方面息：貝爾格勒之共產情報局定十二月初召開首次會議，議程主要事項，當爲法國及捷克共產黨之地位。國際共產領袖，對於該兩國最近之發展顯感不安。預料該會可能將決定一旦於戴高樂　掌政權後法共黨應採之行動。此外並將正式核准烏克蘭共黨之參加情報局。共產情報局之負責人員，聞已由南斯拉夫之米伐諾伐達拉斯雷選為該組織之永久秘書，首次會議之主席非屬諸波蘭共黨領袖佛拉狄斯拉夫，即當屬於新任羅外長保格女士。根據該組織章程草案，主席之職將逐月輪値。</p>
<h3>史達林再度聲明蘇不願發生戰爭　華府認爲蘇似暫不欲赤化全歐</h3>
<p>〔路透社雪梨九日電〕澳蘇協會發表英國坎特培里副主敎詹森最近遊歷東歐及晤見史達林元帥之報吿。據云：史達林曾吿以蘇聯充分認識當前國際問題，決不願發生戰爭。史達林曾曰：「蘇聯不願戰爭，而願與西方國家保持友好關係。蘇聯充分認識和平解決承平時代各種問題之困難，但蘇聯仍願意覓取和平解決，且信必能獲得。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕鑒於最近東區各國肅淸反共政黨之加緊，此問外交界認為蘇聯將暫時轉變赤化全歐洲之努力，而致力於加強南·保·阿·捷·波·匈·羅各國之共黨控制。至於法義兩國則惟有今冬糧食與燃料嚴重缺乏時，共黨始有攫取政權之機會，然即使如此，共黨之控制亦必脆弱，蓋東西歐之經濟與政治習慣根本不同故也。</p>
<p>德境英軍當局　密令鄭重應付</p>
<p>〔聯合社德國杜塞爾道夫九日電〕今日據悉，英佔領軍當局己密令軍政府官員不得參與美軍佔領區反共運動。英方認爲「攻擊共產黨與攻擊蘇聯無法區別」。美軍總督最近曾宣佈美軍將以積極反共運動答復共產黨之指摘，但英方則將保持消極態度，至少至十一月倫敦四國外長會議結束爲止。</p>
<h3>美國朝野重視通貨膨脹威脅</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十日電〕杜魯門總統會坦白承認，通貨膨脹之威脅大有損於美國之繁榮。此言顯示今年十一月十七日及明年一月三日國會舉行會議時將面臨重大之經濟任務。雖緊急援歐計劃及馬歇爾計劃均具有重要之世界性，而通貨膨脹辯論仍爲最重要之內政課題，蓋明年美國將舉行大選，故此事尤足重視。</p>
<h3>美反對分裂德國　四外長會議如一旦失敗　擬單獨與德討經濟協定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕外交政策協會頃發表克萊將軍前行政顧問鮑樂克之報吿，鮑氏在報告中警吿稱，如四外長會議造成德國分裂爲蘇聯及西方兩區，「吾人不如早掘戰壕，以待不可免之衝突」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦九日電〕四外長代表會議美代表團發言人今日聲稱：美國已　就計劃，擬於四外長會議對德和約談判一旦失敗，與德單獨簽訂經濟協定，此項計劃並已與英國私下進行磋商。</p>
<h3>對希臘局勢　美深表關切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十日廣播：華盛頓訊，杜魯門總統今日吿國會稱，由於美國之援助，「希臘依然自由」，但希臘之經濟困難，根本上仍未改善，軍事方面情形更壞。杜魯門對於希臘經濟政治不安內在因素之依然仍在，深表關切。</p>
<h3>義左右兩派衝突</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬九日電〕義北部四城市九日晚左右翼份子互相以機槍及手榴彈射擊，右派份子攻擊「紅色份子」之住宅，而左派份子斥責法西斯份子允准公開行動無虛警察干涉。義大利社會運動之極右派份子米拉克拉，曾遭五名不明身份之暴徒襲擊，　米氏曾出席反對米蘭共黨報紙審判之證訊，米關附近一羣暴徒，以機槍及手榴彈攻擊工業家之住宅。同時之諾維納及蒙柴二地亦有射擊事件。</p>
<h3>菲今日普選</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺十日電〕業已登記之菲律賓選民四百萬，將於明日參加該國獨立後之首次全國選舉，屆時將　出參議員八人，省長一百零一人，省議員一百六十四人，巿長七十六人，及巿鎭議員數千人。自由黨（即執政黨）與國民黨（即少數黨）在選舉前夕，均自信將獲得勝利。全國競選空氣至爲緊張，尤以在黨候選人競爭極烈之若干地區為然，因　選而生之迫害欺詐及强暴行爲，仍不斷發生。</p>
<h3>法工會內部分裂　總工會領袖譴責共黨操縱會務　法共黨勢力遭重大打擊</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十日電〕法國之工會運動已發生値得極度注意之分裂。受共產黨控制之「全國總工會」（法國最大之全國性工會組織）領袖二百人，今日發表宣言，痛詆共產黨之利用工會組織以遂其政治目的，同時並表示支持馬歇爾援歐計劃，聲明決採取行動，以使全國總工會民主化。</p>
<p>全國總工會副兩秘書長之一之茹霍，係工會反共領袖之領導者，甫於上過自紐約返巴黎，據消息靈通方面稱，茹氏鑒於全國總工會之過度顧問國家政事，頗感不安，故決定在法國工會運動中，負起更積極之任務。法國共黨自在政治上陷於孤立後，惟賴全國總工會以保持其勢力，故若一般工人能了解反對馬歇爾計劃即爲拒絕改良的工業水準，則共黨地位將不免動搖。</p>
<p>〔路透社偷敦十日電〕法總工會二百名少數派領袖發表之宣言已引起此間人士之極大興趣。此舉匪特將共產黨問題引入公開衝突之階段，且可能推翻世界工聯協會中共產份子與非共產份子之均勢。過云工會內部如有糾紛，悉由茹霍排解，今茹氏本人即為領導發表此一宣言者，可見分裂形勢已更趨明顯而確定。</p>
<p>日本寄我國郵件　不得稱爲「支那」　否則郵局將不予接受</p>
<p>〔中央社東京九日電〕遞信省宣佈：一切郵件寄往東北者，必須註明中華民國東北，若寫「滿洲」者，將不予接受。信件上凡寫「支那」而不寫中華民國者，亦不予接受。此僅爲日本人企圖在生活各方面滌除過去帝國主義殘餘之若干努力之一，但一般人民心理，對此尙有未能了解者，甚至在日本國會中議員演說時，亦常用「去那」兩字，此擧並非有意，實爲軍國主義之　習難改之現象。</p>
<h3>印度軍接收　珍那迦行政</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里九日電〕權威方面息：印度自治領軍隊一營，在中型坦克協助下，已於今夜開入印度半島東岸珍那迦邦之首邑珍那迦城。業已接受市內行政，未曾發生意外。印度軍係循珍那迦回王行政委會之請而開入。據悉該邦可能變更其前此允諾歸併巴基斯坦之決議，而決定歸併印度自治領。印度軍並已接收珍那迦之第一要港維拉凡爾，及珍那迦邦陸軍總部。</p>

<h3>冬令救濟費籌募不容易　賽馬極難實現仍望戲院援手　且看今日談話結果</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來天時突然轉寒，街頭遊民漸將受凍餒之威脅。爲籌募本市冬令救濟費，市蠢議會曾有舉行慈善賽馬之決議。記者昨訪吳市長，詢市府方面籌備情形。據吳市長表示：賽馬之舉，尙未有着落。因市府尙未與跑馬總會商酌。市長對跑馬總會當局表示塲地經久不用，頗有損毀，須市府准其連續使用若干年後，方頗加以修理一點，認爲絕不可能，因跑馬　塲地，政府已有決意收買。惟收買方式尙未決定，或發行公債，或採土地交換辦法，尙待從長計議。且塲地修理需若千時日，及賽馬是否有問題，亦未得知。故今冬賽馬是否能成事實，現尙未能預</p>
<p>據吳市長語記者，本屆本市冬令救濟費至少需六百億元，即日進行捐募。上次參議大會曾議決在娛樂捐中加徵百分之廿，片商及戲院業方面一致反對，市府決於今日召集片商代表及戲院業公會負責人談話，希望渠等爲貧苦大衆服務，予以接受。</p>

<p>十四家屋必須拆除</p>

<h3>練過太極拳爬墻有本領　謝鐘敏殺人未遂處有期徒刑八年　潛人鄰家疑另有目的</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕住厦門路二三六弄二十六號南京靑年謝鍾敏，因沉緬歌台舞榭，將以前經營絲業之積蓄化用殆蓋，且復失業，爲親友所不齒，精神大受刺激，於上月十六日下午購得手銬一副，麻繩一根，棉花一包，剪刀一把，次日黎明三時，携帶手槍一枝，連同上項物件，潛至貼鄰劉姓前門，先將常話綫剪斷，用繩打結，套於二樓窗口攀登樓上，意圖不法，爲劉姓夫婦察覺驚呼，謝竟開檐一饗逃逸，後爲警員於北浙江路橋畔擒獲，解送法院依盜匪罪嫌起訴。昨日下午二時在地院刑四庭首度審訊，被吿供稱：南京人現年二十四歲，十月十六日下午十時回家，即躺在客堂沙發上，一時半　母自友處雀戲歸，上樓安寢，我即出外，至劉家門前徘徊後復返，如此進出五六次。至此　判長沈天保即詰問謝「係進出五六次，是不是發神經病？」</p>

<h3>全憑觸覺體認世界　盲童學校苦心孤詣訓練剝奪視覺兒童</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫）根據一個比較可靠的統計，中國現在有五百萬以上的盲人，而訓練敎養盲人的學校祗有五十多個，假定每一學校收容三百人，則受到訓練的尚不滿一萬人，其余數百萬永恒地和光明隔絕了的人們，則毫無抵抗的接受了他們的悲劇命運，讓蒼白的想像呑噬了他們無吿的一生</p>
<p>盲人在後天的貢獻上，並不弱於一個明眸亮目的人，傑劉鴻生的秘書宋關林，英文大美晚報編輯章培信，以及全國盲人協會幹事吳國彪，他們都是被造物者剝奪了親覺糊利的人物，但是經過盲童學校的十年訓練，終於路進了聖約翰大學，吳國彪並且在約大畢業後，又留美兩年，在哥倫此亞大學獲得學位歸來。　　成就值得欽佩</p>
<p>盲童學校在這一方面的成就是值得令人敬佩的。看着他們校內的設施，則更使人驚奇於他們的細心與毅力。一　平坦的道路中，每隔一段有一塊凹凸的坡地，這是有橫路可通的標記；設計了各式各樣的實物模型，使肓生在觸覺中體認世界的眞相；你不要以爲這是一件簡單的事；先生與學生之間並沒有一點共通的親覺，全憑這些摸索與碰撞，　構成了他們意識中從未經騐過的宇宙雛形。</p>
<p>（上）盲童用小鑽打洞，排列成家，便於摸索（下）盲童學校勞作之一，編結絨線（本報攝）</p>
<h3>智慧並不低劣</h3>
<p>在盲童學校內，記者看到了一個九歲的小學生施明德，他是這學校僅有的一個家庭比</p>
<p>較富裕的學生。據他說這世界對他是太生疏了，連父母親的容貌都沒有印象，記憶完全等於一張白紙，但他唯一能够推測的是螢光燈（日光燈）比較電燈亮。另外一個女孩子則說：她一天的時間有十小時以上是消磨在編結絨綫的工作上面，腦子裏盡是長針和短針交織成的方格和花紋的痕跡，因比她對世界空間好像也有佈滿了方格和花紋的錯覺。此外還有一個二十三歲的盲生對記者說：廿餘年來生活經騐的積累，使他養成了一切都慢的習慣　，無論吃飯，走路，小便，能慢儘量慢，因爲他相信惟有慢動作纔能使目的順利達成。</p>
<p>願大家不要輕蔑那些沒有得到訓練和敎養機會的盲人！他們的智慧並不低能，問題是造物者和社會辜負了他們！</p>

<h3>為了楊安仁喝米湯引起監獄軒然大波　騷動已趨平息課長自請處分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲了楊安仁喝米湯而引起軒然大波之上海監獄內騷動事件，爲明瞭眞相起見，記者昨走訪上海監獄當局，對在押之金潮案主角楊安仁。詹　生，作半小時之訪問。楊短髮篷鬆，鬍髭滿腮，衣監布短衫褲，黑布鞋，對此次騷動事件，稱係因喝米湯而起，二〇二號等犯人藉題需索賠價每人牛奶兩瓶，以四千人計算，共計入千瓶，惟楊稱渠並未出錢。在中秋節前亦有　苦犯人揚言索詐，楊均價之不理。渠對智識份子犯罪者與　三流氓犯罪者，同押一處，深以爲苦，希能有所改革。</p>
<p>至監獄醫院訪詹　生，詹戴絨錢小　，衣黑　夾　，藍綢紮脚褲，由人扶之下樓。渠稱因患血　高，住醫院已有十餘日，現仍打針服藥，過去亦吃過米湯，是以自己的　頭食品醬菜交換，渠進醫院三日後，始發生騷動事件，故祥細情形不知，亦未出錢，進監時其他犯人對之會有侮　　動意圖索詐，惟　均忍耐不加反抗。</p>
<p>報吿·處理經過·</p>
<p>上海監獄騷動事件經　衛課　長丁葆成之彈壓，已趨於平息，平時品性不良，喜歡鬧事者，共犯人九十一名，集中押於「和監」內，嚴加管束，促其反省。聞該獄典獄長孔祥霖今日將返滬，驚衛課丁課長已擬好關於處理該項事件經過之報吿書一份，幷自請處分，原文略謂：「炊塲爐間工犯因私嫌發生交鬨，炊爈兩間服役工犯衆多，本　未僱燒爐技師，飯盒補充未成，終日開飯，秩序不免稍有凌亂，而際此新　交替，人事未齊，佈置未定，致一切管理，無從採取斷然處置，此種艱困情形，自早在鈞長洞鍳之中。</p>
<p>事緣</p>
<p>日昨（三日）炊事犯一八〇號等，對同塲工犯二〇二號，四一九號，六五一號，（即施連根，周興龍，許載昌）行爲不滿，請職課加以隔離，罪役聯名數十人請求，而二〇二號等亦指對方結黨營私，排除異己。當以雙方純係意氣之爭，除飭各提證據呈核外，以該二〇二號等旣犯衆怒，立予隔離收禁。本日（四）最恐雙方衝突，親率　備班至炊塲監視發飯送水，幷促雙方速提證送課。復據看守長王　准　敎化課長儉修吿知，此種爭執，各有幕後人物，已在摸淸綫索，進行和解中。</p>
<p>同時</p>
<p>職以雙方人犯皆係亡命之從，而炊塲工具隨時　為武器，急於中午將各監房工塲鐵門上鎖，錀匙收回，各　加配武器翁守，幷將退動看守召集在外，聽候調遣。因據王炘看守長密吿，雙方各有近千人相助，無論是否屬實，要不得不作嚴　戒備。下午二時，　課長王看守長正去催詢雙主試行和解結果，復據一八〇號等推代表到課作進一步要求，力爭二〇二號等須由監獄當局立調離蓋。而二〇二號等被衆攻擊之三犯，則堅持此後即使　開炊塲，亦須留塲數日，全其　面。職默察雙方已不能協調，即論各回原處，幷飭一八〇　等從速照常工作。</p>
<p>開飯</p>
<p>時巳下午三時余。二〇二號等回至監房途中。遇送水炊塲工犯，出言不遜，與炊事犯三一四七號（即周文龍）發生爭執。當時在典獄長室北面臨內監大院，突見炊塲囚犯蜂擁而出，持械者十餘人，徒手者十餘人，當即喝令放下器械，幷命　備班向空鳴槍示　，各犯始懾伏後退。經奉上海高院派來　主科同意，由本監電知上海地院看守所，將二〇二號，四一九號，六五一號三犯暫予收禁，同時命炊塲工犯照常工作開飯，其他場所人犯，幸及早戒備，　無波及，至此告一段落。」</p>
<h3>地檢處提騷動案主犯</h3>

<h3>蘭州白衣菴　租屋起糾紛尼姑謀自盡</h3>
<p>〔本報蘭州五日航訊〕蘭州市益民路白衣菴內一四十餘歲的尼姑，法號恒一，該菴現有師徒五人，均賴菴產六十餘間之租金爲生。去年春天，有自稱蘭山中學校校長之王仲英其人，聲稱該菴房產，已奉省府令撥給開辦蘭山中學，旋將菴內租住之居民一體驅除，佔去房屋四十一間之多，是時菴主恒一，曾控王於皋蘭地方法院，後經法院排解，於六月間以王仲英名義出訂租約，四十一間房屋每月租金兩萬元，後以物價日漲夜大，恒一一再懇求王校長增加租金，延至今春，始增至六萬元。</p>
<p>今夏，王仲英以擴充校舍爲詞，更侵占該菴其餘房屋二十二間，且每月僅有之六萬元租金，亦於今年七月間停止付給。（記者按：目前蘭市住房每間月租即須十萬元，臨街舖房猶數倍之。）</p>
<p>該菴住持恒一因目前衣食無着，生活頓陷絕境，特於上月三十日午後二時，赴王寓催收租金，王非但不付，且大肆恫嚇，並勒令恒一將師徒五人僅以藏身之三間房屋亦指日騰出，恒一以其聲勢洶洶，無力對抗，且生活又陷絕境，在此掘燄　人之下，見王氏診桌上有裁紙短刀一把，遂萌短念，握刀自殺，傷在喉部，深三分許，長二寸三分，當即暈倒，血流如注。</p>

<p>細紗下挫</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開紡調會開紗議價雖提高，塲內情勢因環境利賣，人心不振，多頭轉售甚夥，行情反吿下挫。迨近收以染織廠及客帮，逢低搜吸，市再回揚，最後四十二支藍鳳細紗，比週六軋低三十萬，為三千六百二十萬元。四十支藍鳳亦低卅萬元，其餘卅二·廿支等粗紗，步漲十五萬至三五十萬元不等。</p>
<p>棉布轉俏</p>
<p>棉布市况，晨開因隔日浮多競吐，喊價盤低，嗣至十時後，客路長沙漢口福建等都吸收元直貢呢，本街染廠買進中檔細布，行情轉俏。迨至結果，十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，較週六續漲四五千至四萬元，四君子直貢猛升五萬五千，其他各布脚地亦頗堅挺。</p>

<p>昨日現棉市况繼續堅挺，外埠客帮添辦甚　，同業州亦多補進，價格仍較上週六微升三四萬，各檔成交一四〇〇包左右。送廠價做開靈　四〇〇萬，冲通州三七五萬，棧交價做開靈　三九六萬，漢細三五九萬六千，沙市三七○萬，福德三一〇萬，姚花二六四萬五千，火機二九〇萬，周　　花六七萬。</p>
<p>紗布南運變更手續</p>
<p>紡調會急需辦理本月份紗布輸往華南申請事宜，定十一日起開始，核定輸往華南紗布總額，述上月剩餘額合併為紗五千件左右，布十四萬餘　該會為防止申請廠商多報少運，或轉讓流弊起見，本月份起，特將廠商申請辦法略予改善。凡申請輸往體裁南之紗布運銷商，以前原由該運銷商直接塡表蓋章申請，現改爲由申請運銷商，取得空白申請書塡就後，將申請　交由生產廠商蓋章，由蓋章紗廠將該運銷商申請書，代向紡調會申請，因此可免除運銷商之流弊云。</p>
<h3>國際市塲障衛繁多　出口貿易不易發展　國貨廠商亟應實行聯合推銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國最近之出口貿易，又入逆境。除掛牌匯率與黑市不能一致之原因外，尙有各銷塲之本身困難。以美國而論，生絲原爲重要出口，但近以美國進口日絲渦多，存貨堆積，需要減少，市價跌落，影響華絲銷路。華茶國因際競爭之故，出口不多。豬　之銷路尙隹，主因爲缺乏競爭，而代替品之尼隆，其品質究尙不能與天然者相比。惟近傳德國有整理猪　機器之發明，如屬確實，對我將爲大打擊。歐洲方面，英國爲較大之主顧，其對糧食之需要甚迫切，一般穀物我國不能供給，僅由中信局與英糧食部交易，輸出大量鷄蛋。最近本市蛋廠數家，擬將鷄蛋及其製品輸英已由經濟部工商輸　處代爲介紹，與英糧食部之分配官員取得聯緊。以便明悉彼邦需要之品種，而能先作準備。至於歐陸方面，展望並不良好，蓋　經大戰，創傷未癒，購買力甚低，而主要國家仍維持戰時配給制，需要外貨之數量不大。印度及南洋一帶，爲有希望之市塲，但亦以國貨廠商能放棄個別競爭實行聯合推銷爲前提，目前則已有此種良好之傾向。</p>
<h3>中英合作防止走私　由香港開往中國各港口船隻須繳驗港政府證實之艙口單</h3>
<p>香港航訊：我海關當局對於防止走私，現作更嚴密措施。由本月十五日起，凡由香港開往我國口岸之船隻，應於到達時，將該船在香港裝運至該地之貨物艙口單一份，呈遞當地海關。該艙口單應先請由香港政府機關簽證，始生效力。其有不列入艙口單之貨物，即以私貨論罪。此措施現已由中英　方當局取得合作，以杜絕私運。港府新聞處稱，中國政府對於由香港輸入中國貨物之艙口單，經　一種困難，相信由香港付往中國各港口而備有香港艙口單之貨物，間有在中途遷卸，私運入中國。至令船到中國港口時，所呈出之艙口單，與編製呈上香港常局之艙口單不相符合，中國政府現邀請香港當局合作，設法防止此種行為。故由十一月十五日起，到達中國港口之各船隻，載有由香港落船之貨者，須備有香港政府負責機關蓋印之艙口單，呈上當地之中國海關檢閱。爲應付上述中國海關之規定，各航商可向香港船政　領取離港證明，一併呈出由香港落船貨物艙口單。若無香港落船貨物，亦須呈出「無香港落船貨物」艙口單。該項艙口單要正副兩份，由船政署發給離港證時蓋印。一張發還航商或其代理人。第二張寄交香港海關。該第二張艙口單可用作按照一九二二年第十五條（出入口貨物登記則例）規定存放香港海關之艙口單。此辦法係便利航商落貨，直至預備離港時，而避免奔走兩政府機關。一為取離剛證，一為呈繳一份艙口單。上述辦法，係指由香港前往中國港口船隻，有香港落船之貨物，而載往中國港口者而言。同船載有由別處運往中國，而路經香港，或回香港落船，而運往中國國外某港之貨物，則不在此例。</p>
<h3>人造絲稍堅</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市稍堅，一二〇號旭字一A有光，上午八千六百五十萬元即期有成交，後因有中信局配售，須從新檢查，本週或有暫時停止之說，故下午人心比較堅　，同行七百五千萬元有成交，最後價八百萬元有人要，結果比　週末大二百萬元。</p>
<h3>自備外匯貨品登記期限延長　十一月十八日截止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出入管理委員會辦理補行登記自備外匯無許可證之貨品種類及其限額期限，管理會昨日公布延至十一月十八日為</p>
<h3>「公布前」許可證准延期至本年底</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出入管理會昨發出公告規定關於附表　　及　用各類貨品，已簽發之「公布前」輸入許可證，　　載明有效期限者，該項許可證之有效期限，准予一律展至木年十二月三十一日為止，為附表　（乙）尖「公布前」輸入許可證之有效期限，一律截至本年七月三十一日為止，所有上述各類有關貨品之進口報單，倘已在上述規定有效期限內辦理報關手續，則該項「公布前」輸入許可證一律失效，關於上述「公布前」輸入許可證事項，以及關於附表　類貨品「公布前」輸入許可證，申請換掉「公布後」輸入許可證事項，應向輸管會非限額輸入審核處查詢辦理。</p>
<h3>輸管會獎勵出口貨：包裝材料特許進口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出入管理委員會為獎　輸出，特許裝運出口貨物所需包裝材料准予進口，並通知出口商於本月十二日起廿七日止，赴仁記路中國銀行大樓三樓三二一室輸出推廣處辦理登記，以便審核。同時公布「出口商裝運出口貨物所需包裝材料將特許進口半法」：</p>
<p>出口商爲其出口口業所需用之包裝材料，得於此項貨物之限額外，憑特許進口證　運進口。但已受此項優待之出口商，不得於包裝材料之普通進口限額內，再行分受此項特許。進口證由輸出入管理委員會發給。</p>
<p>出口商如欲享受此項優待辦法，應向輸出擴管理委員會輸出　廣處申請。其申請書應備具左列各條：甲·進口包裝材料之細目；乙·所需數量約計價值及包裝之貨物及其數量；丙·　用此項材料之港口。</p>
<p>輸出推廣年於發給此項特許進口證之前，應將出口商之申請書，按照所列各項，詳予審核。並需確知所有已予特許進口材料之總量，並不超過中國全年所需之正當總額。輸出推廣處如於審核任何申請書時，認為所請之數量有超過實際需要者，並得酌予核減。</p>
<p>出口商應提供保證，非經輸出推廣年書面核准，不得將此項時許進口之材料，在市塲出售。凡受優待辦法，已將包裝材料進口之出口商，應於每三個月終，造具　單，呈送輸出推廣處。該單應詳列包裝出口貨物所用材料之數量，如出口商之存底有超過將來出口需用之可能者，　　推廣處得按其規定條件，將該出口商所　部份，轉售於一需要此項材料之出口商人。</p>
<p>輸出推廣處得有權自行稽核出口所呈送之　單。</p>
<p>鑒於棉花之經濟處理及運輸至中國各工業區之重要性，前項辦法，亦得適用於內銷棉花之包裝。</p>

<h3>慶祝第一屆工業節</h3>
<p>— 吳蘊初</p>
<p>國有沃野之　，而民不足於食者，耕鋤少器械未備，使晨工不能交流，而　　穫之期望也，地有貨物之　，而民不足於財者，　　之　量未啓，使游查泛　市塲，而眛開發之　利也。市有滯塞之貨而民不足於用交通之器材未給，使盈　未能互劑，而著平準之　效也。由此　之，工業興則農增其　商增其利民富於內，國强於外，故工業之消長，與國家強蠶成比例，民生貧富相聯緊，於此知人之富强非倖致，我之貧弱非偶失，可　吾人之深長思矣，設不謀建工以資開發，使地盡其利，而求國　富張，民臻豐裕，是何　　倉敖以救飢，琮　門而大嚼，向刻虎雕龍，招風邀　，而謂風雲能　致　？若徒持舶來爲挹注，姑不問利源之外溢，爲弱國貧民之主因，而能如取諸外府，無盡無竭，以供虛耗歟？川源不能　　　，山海不能瞻溪　，古有明訓，足資警惕，况坐耗者旣甚於　漏，待益者更異乎溪　　！今者天未厭亂，國尙搆兵，烽燧更緊，　　無開發之望，生產頻縮，工廠有崩潰之　，心所謂危，敢安械默，故於歡欣慶祝之時，復作迫切呼　之語，使社會人士共識工建之重要，羣起扶植，導引游資，納正軌而爲民利，增加生產，足貨物以培國基，否則雖知沃壤之任良田，直木之中梁柱，而終不墾之以播嘉　，伐之以構梁棟，奚解不粒，何救　居，凡我從事工業之人士，宜如何昕夕　勉，上不負政府之期望，下顧念民生之憔悴，懷堅毅成愼之心，度風雨飄搖之秋，以待鞮　廻輪，雄關散壯貅之隊，桃林解甲，武庫　黃鳥之旗，人懐颶發之心，國有隆郅之治，則百工之貨無不　，九地之利無不瞻，緬懐今日之艱辛，始識　果之眞味矣。茲値慶祝第一屆工業節，謹供　　，願與全國工業界人士共旃勉　！</p>
<h3>從慶祝工業節談到提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 胡伯翔</p>
<p>今日爲中國有史以來首屆紀念日，意義之重大不言而喻，我國本以農立國，視工業爲副業，加以民國成立以來，戰亂頻仍，雖國內有識之士，提倡工業，無奈强環視，未能完成，以工建國之願望，迨經八年抗戰，工業雖遭嚴軍破壊，但以勝利屬我，使舉國上下，均已深知工業建國之重要，此我工業界之同　慶慰者也。</p>
<p>工業之衰微，有關國勢，固已盡人而知，在抗戰前，歐美東鄰挾其工業優勢之設備，視吾國爲消納過　貨物之尾　，迫使國內工廠無法與其競爭，坐令長期入超，造成國弱民貧之主因，故發展工業最主要之因素，實爲提倡國貨，使人民均知採用國貨，則工廠之生產必增，生產增則成本必减售價，自低工廠因而繁榮，工業漸臻發達，利源不外溢，國勢自强盛，人民自富足，故有識之土，羣起呼　，誘導人民，養成愛用國貨之習慣。</p>
<p>吾於此重要感焉！在承平之時，受舶來之挹注，漠然無　於中，若一旦戰事發生，交通斷絕，頓覺手足無所揩矣。設平時不恃外貨，雖　突變，亦足自給，何致提　見肘，　態畢露哉　故我於工業節紀念之日，重申提倡國貨之重要，以正吿全國人民，為老生當談，身起力行，以培工業之初基，更盼從事工業之人士，對技術之改良質料之提高，尤須再三注意，則人民自必樂於採用，以袪除　拜洋貨之心理，幸我工業界共勉之。</p>
<h3>希望</h3>
<p>— 榮鴻元</p>
<p>中國以農立國，未　注意於工業建設，忽視「工業」足以富强，足以興邦之重要性，循致國弱民貧，無以自給，抗戰期間，我脆弱之幼稚工業，幾被摧毀殆盡，勝利以來，外觀世界趨勢，內察國家現狀，知非努力工業建設强化經濟力量，實難與世界各國爭一日之長，瑞士一小邦，而從事工業的達百分之四十四。莫洛托夫在慶祝蘇聯十月革命卅週年紀念席上演詞稱：「雖受戰爭的摧殘蘇聯的工業生產，已恢復戰前水準」（見報載莫斯科七日廣播）麥克沃塞處處扶助日本，一要恢復他的工業水準至一九三四年的程度。回顧我國勝利後的工業生產情形是怎樣，毋待我　述，大家當已感覺到前途十分黯淡。古人說：「多難興邦」，我們只要及早　覺努力自强，已辦工廠的如何謀設備之改進，生產之增加，未辦工廠富有財力的，趕快投資工業，研究工業，務以畢生從事工業以復興中國經濟建設爲己任，効力國家，貢獻國家，爲國家爭當强，爭光榮，同時希望工人秉「有廠始有工」之旨同，風雨同舟，勞資協調，努力增加工作效率，不斷的生產，勿使有一分一秒的怠工，而致生產時斷時續，威脅到國家的經濟命脈，今天正値全世界多數人類在饑餓綫上掙扎，中國人又大多數陷入烽火慘酷及通貨膨賬的痛苦深淵裏，如何拯救社會生活痛苦，惟有竭力復興戰前的工業生產水準與積極發展新工業的建設，始得爭生存於世界。欣逢「慶祝中國第一屆工業節」，敬獻熱烈的期望，願與我工業界同人共勉之。</p>
<h3>詮釋「工業節」之意義</h3>
<p>— 工</p>
<p>立一名而能歷世千百播傳人口者，陳義必高，涵意必深，但習而不察，終必隱晦，故於慶祝之際，將規定十一月十一日爲工業節之意義，詳加詮釋：溯本會于抗戰間期，協助政府致力工建，雖設備簡陋資缺乏，而仍能上供軍需，下給民用，旣而夷酋　璧請降，本會復員東歸，于卅五年十一月九日起迄十一日止，在首都召開第一次全國代表大會，僉以我國工業向居落後，迨抗戰軍興，始感工業建設之重要，我工業協會由是成立，奠定中國之新工業，其意義至為重大，故呈准行政院規定十一月十一日爲「中國工業節」，以資紀念而勵來茲。此工業節所出規定及選於十一月之所由來也。</p>
<p>大會之日期，有三選于十一日者何也？稽古索今月日雙重　成佳節，自一月一日起，二月二日爲花朝，三月三日爲上已，四月四日爲兒童節，五月五日爲端陽，七月七日爲乞巧，八月八日爲父親節，九月九日爲重陽，十月十日爲國慶，雖歷有陰陽之別，而情無今古之殊，復以大會完成之日期，適逢月日雙重，以結集之總力，謀普遍之發展，雖爲本會成立之期，實肇工建新生之機，蘊義殊深，故占此月日定爲令節，非惟資紀念亦足醒視聽，此工業節選於十一日之所由來也。</p>
<p>不　惟是，十者數之終，一一者數之始，循環而轉，　息無窮，故盛極而衰剝極而復，一成不刋之定例也。十一兩字，正咎蘊剝極而復之意義。追溯吾國工業，發源極早，斯時民風淳樸，桓寬所謂工所以備器械是也。下逮周季工業突興，管子云：隴蜀之丹漆旄羽，荆揚之皮革骨象，江南之楠梓竹箭，待工而成略可概見，且墨子與魯班挺生（木工迄今尙奉班爲祖師），遂使工業中興，墨子中之紀載猶可覆按，備梯備突備穴諸篇，指爲機械之權興，亦無不可，且其弟子三百人所惜我國素輕工業，繼起無人，墨學遂衰，以致我國工業，歷二十餘年而無進展，可謂剝之極矣，今者工業雖經八年抗戰之破壊，仍能藩延滋息，奠此堅毅不拔之基，展望未來，實蘊無窮之希望。况工業會法，已經政府明令頒佈，使工業協會從此有法團之她位，此工業節規定於十一月十一日所涵蘊之意義也。</p>
<p>在慶祝大會之前，山西省工業協會電詢工業節規定於十一月十一日之意義，雖經電覆，但文簡字略，未　其蘊，吾知蓄疑者不止一省一會，故乘慶祝之際，撰文銓釋，從事工業之人士，熟詳其意義而不致迷惘誤惑，然則吾口之文或非語　辭費　！</p>
<h3>慶祝工業節應有的任務</h3>
<p>— 莊智煥</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰結束以後，世界各國，除少數國家外，均普遍動　不安，這種現象目前繼續地存在擴　，在我們國內，也是同樣的情形，所以各界人士，都感覺到前途困難重重，尤以工業界，因為原料的缺乏，使各種工業，都呈着　瘓的狀態，要想改進，也是無從着手，但這一點，由於世界大勢所趨，我們不必悲觀，我們更要在這艱苦的環境中，打開一條出路！</p>
<p>我國的工業，現在還是落後，一切的設備規模，都比較簡陋，但是在目前的環境裏，正是急起直追，向前途　進的一個機會，這個機會，在我們工業界應該好好的利用，關於我國工業的前途，並不希望有像美國這樣大規模工廠，只要提倡健全的中小型工廠，這理由因為我們財力的不夠，從事工業技術人才的缺少，加以大規模工廠，工人集中，管理上的困難，所以不宜建立規模較大的工廠，如果眞正能做到提倡健全中小型工廠的計劃，已經可以使我們工業踏入正規，漸漸地發揚光大。</p>
<p>今天是第一屆工業節，是我國有史以來，從事工業的一個大紀念日，在這一個紀念日，我們從事工業的，應該有所警惕，對過作一個總檢討，對將來的有一個大計劃；也可以使全國人民，都能明瞭國家需要工業發達的意義，年年今日，如果每一個從事工業的，能夠檢討過去，計劃未來，我國工業的發達，一定前途無量，並且還希望將來每逢在這一個紀念日，要有一個盛大的工業展覽會，來表示工業界的努力和進步。</p>
<h3>工業節展望</h3>
<p>— 尹致中</p>
<p>在工業危機深刻化的現階段下，忽逢今日第一次的工業節，我們旣懐着無限的感慨，亦寄予無窮的希望，但我所感慨的並不是我們工業的落後，而祗感慨於我們工業的磨折。因爲中國科學向不發達，自海禁開放以來，又遭　滿淸腐敗政治的流毒，使國家長期的停留在封建的農業村市中，所以阻　了接受科學的機會，直到最近的四五十年來，方由手工業　手混合工業漸漸的興辦到若干機製的製工業，所以工業的落後，是由於先天的缺憾無可強求，倘然於第一次國民革命成功後，政府就能了解工業於國家的重要性，而急起直追，建設工廠，開發原料，培養技術人才，拿我們廣大的人力與較廉的工資，以與各國競爭，希望仍然很大，收效仍復很速，工業落後，並不是工業拘　的主要因素</p>
<p>若要談到世界的工業先進國，當然要推英國是個中的祭　，尤其紡織工業的發達，更使人望塵莫及。然而德意志日本與美法等國，雖比較中國是先進，但以視英國已大爲落後，但因爲他們政府的提倡，人民的建設，各種輕重工業同時並進，他們並不因比英國的工業落後而減色，反而有許多工業後來居上，在第二次世界大戰以前，各以工業與英國聯　並　,稱雄世界。就中日本的發展工業，也在明治維新以後，是中國的年代不多，然而他的生產力，足使歐美側目，中國驚心，亦並不以落後而減色。若中國也同日德等國的努力建設，以中國的人口之多，生產與消費力的強大，何至遽不如英美德日諸國，而竟自暴自　，徘徊在「農業中國」的悲境中。這病源的潛伏，實由於自己的不能培養工業，反自　喪工業。所以我說，中國工業的不發達，不在工業的落後，而在工業的遭受磨折。</p>
<p>中國工業的　折，果然與歷年來內憂外患的兵速禍結有關，而政府不知誘導提倡，仍爲最大的原因。第一，政府不能保護工業，海關任洋貨無限制的輸入，和外人居住中國的特殊權利。如利用租界設立工廠，利用治外法權，奴役勞工，利用雄厚的資金。　斷　內原料，勾結中國官塲，　迫弱小工廠的掙扎，這些都是中國工業所遭受到的重大磨折。</p>
<p>再中國政府對中國的工業並未認識其重要性與獨立性。一向視工業團體是商業團體的附屬品，好像工業品旣是要賣錢的，就是商品，就應當屬於商業的範　，而竟忘却了他生產的獨立性，這是最大的錯誤！</p>
<p>但經過了工業界不斷的奮鬥，政府已能　然改圖，且已承認工業界應有一超然獨立的組織，並在不久以前，把工業法規也正式公佈了，政府這一種　明的措施，實値得我們稱公布，而現在政府　責人員與　業界人士，也時常討論，並對關於各種工業方面的耍求，已能虛心　受，和以前相較，確已大有徑庭了！從此以後，工業團體方是一個健全而合法的機構，他能負起發展工業，建設工業的責任，可以把他所受的　折。在　國一致的合作中而銷除。</p>

<h3>評二屆木刻展</h3>
<p>— 史良黻</p>
<p>新興木刻自經抗戰培育了它，發展到現階段，的確是壯大了；一班作家興趣大都趨向於「大幅」與「套色」的創作，這一次展出的作品「小品」就非常少，篇幅最大的有二三尺長，套色版最多的達五六色，道與抗戰期問各地的木展一比，就不可同日而語了。關於大幅與套色的構　與按巧，一般的說起來，都很不錯，但是嚴格的一審視，有些固然値得我們　賞，而有些也有値得批評的。</p>
<p>從成功方面說：套色版有刃錄的「弔」，阿楊的「春節　寗」，迪支的「難　的午餐」，克萍的「辛勤的遠景」等幅，無論在　圖，設色，刀法，印技各方面，都表現着高度的美感。雖然會塲上有人批評迪支的一幅不該用淡黃色襯底，而應用其他悲哀的顏色襯底，可是我認爲不然，因爲難童獲得午餐，是世間最痛快的事精，那末淡黃的氛圍，表現着輕鬆愉快，正是恰到好處，這些地方—畫家的苦心，我們是應該體味而讚揚的。其次談到單色版，單色的，以我的生觀的看法，西厓，永玉，子頣的作品爲最佳。西　的「城裏的故事」，「秋郊」，「散步」，「勸阻」，永玉的「苗舞」，「浴」，「講故事」，「拾麥穗」。子頤的「憇」等幅，除了有着農厚的詩的趣味以外，更能把我國古代木刻技巧的精髓表現在陰刻的綫條裏，我認為他們這幾張大作，可以算是這次全木展的代表作了。單色的，雖然還有李　野夫劉　朱鳴崗等高明的作品，但他們的構圖刀法，終不脫蘇聯木刻的作風，鳴崗雖然不大有蘇聯風，但是每　「綫條」都太具統一性，變化少，使人沒有新的感覺，這也是美中不足的地方。</p>
<p>從缺點方面說：我們覺得這次愛桿的作品竟佔了二三十幅之多，這二三十幅中閒，只有一幅套色的還相當成功，其餘的都比一較粗糙，像「台灣煤塲」，「車箱裏」，「高雄田野」，「候渡」等幅，構圖也不很精確。再如珂田的幾幅，篇幅是那麽大，而塲面又那麽空虛，不如選展兩三幅特色的作品，反能給人家一個好印象的。</p>
<p>此外，這次全木展，還有荒烟，　恒，葉飛，沙岳等幾位名木刻家，都沒有作品，也是很遜色的。</p>

<h3>教授（木刻）</h3>
<p>— 可揚</p>
<h3>黃錯草</h3>
<p>— 醉生</p>
<p>時候，要算黃昏了。</p>
<p>假使這是一個月夜，凈藍底天幕上，縣掛着一輪皎麗的梳月，四周密佈着點點的繁星，那時，你若在冷街曲巷中閒步着，讓月光的淸輝，如輕紗似的籠罩着你四周底氣氛中，那你就會深切的領略到一種和諧的情味，在你底被一天瑣事疲倦了的神經裏，</p>
<p>你若嫌白　太煩膩，子夜太深沉，那末，最可愛的將感到舒適的情趣。</p>
<p>聽！那裏傳來了一陣輕　的洞蕭聲，那凄婉哀怨的調子，是詩人的海戀曲呢？抑是流水的鳴咽，或者是秋虫的殘鳴吧！那凄凉底聲音，在黃昏空氣中　了一道裂痕。</p>
<p>你是一個遠離鄕井萍飄　泊的流浪者吧！那你聽了一定會感觸你底游子的心，悵望天涯，雲天渺渺，古老的家園未知荒　幾許，關山萬里的故鄉，山遙水迢的行程，買舟歸去，又待何年何月呢？</p>
<p>簫聲　傳到古剎　方外的僧人，靑燈紅魚，那暮　晨鐘底生涯，有誰是心願的呢？縱你禪心如絮，恐怕亦要不克自持，懐戀着人世間的繁華，撩起了溫馨的綺思吧！</p>
<p>黃　泛舟，又該是如何詩樣的享受呢！一葉扁舟，泛蕩湖上，假使你與素心人在一起，面對佳麗，暗香入懐，你會不會想到六朝的風華，那明月深處，畫舫如雲，……但我想你一定會廻腸盪氣，輕輕的低吟着「繁華事散逐香　，流水無情　自春」的詩抄吧！</p>
<p>黃昏又是最宜於寫作的時候，無論淸風明月，凄風細雨，在那靜寂底四圍，又誰有人來打擾你底淸寂的心呢！假使這是一個月　星朗的黃昏，那末你可寫些秀麗的小品文，而風吹雨打的黃昏呢？吿訴你，寫一些略帶悲劇色彩的小說，最爲相宜了。</p>
<p>「夕陽無限好，祗是近黃昏」，隨園的詩韻是那麼深刻的把中年人的哀愁，拉得長長的。年華似水，歲月悠悠，美人盡暮，駐　乏術，亦只得徒然的怨嗟逝去的靑春，又何能抓住呢？</p>
<p>假使你感到白畫太煩膩，子夜太深沉，那末，最可愛的時候，要算黃昏了。</p>

<p>今年春天，我看了全國木刻協會的「全國一屆木刻展」，留下的影像是：現實性的強烈，作者態度的認眞。但很少新的風格。</p>
<p>這一次的木展，距第一屆雖不過短短的半年，出品却呈現了許多的新形式新內容，尤其在形式上的發掘，廣泛得有點驚人，在內容上倒沒有上一次的強烈的現實性了。</p>
<p>中國農民是喜愛恬靜明朗的，像他們所愛好的年畫，連環畫，都是這一類作風，木刻在民族形式的發展上，也正向這一條路發展。在這次木展中所看到的新作風都呈現這種趨向。這是頗爲正確的，而値得重視的。</p>
<p>刃鋒的綫條最富有創造力，在「木刻選」上的作品，大都人物描寫的圖上都是應用他所創的富有金石味的綫條，是從他所愛好的鏠鼎碑刻上剝　的紋路得到啓發。這次的「四方」「四季」八幅畫，却又是另外一種綫條了，「金石氣」沒有失去，又加上西洋風的柔和美，和民族形式的明朋樸質作風而構成一種富有魅力的勻稱和有詩意的綫條，如「四季」中的「冬」　一名「　述」）便充滿力量而不見粗獷。</p>
<p>黃永和西　的作風，綫條，都是獨樹一幟，西星勻稱而柔和，但在綫條的斷處又呈現堅決和刀味。幾幅裝飾畫很工整，「城裏的故事」則佈局，刀味木味都够。黃永玉的綫條正和他的構思一樣的富有想像力，這種綫條用來繪製童話播　是最好也沒有的了。</p>
<p>麥桿是在努力探求新形式中，首屆木展中有　畫風味極濃的「覆　」，這次有「回娘家」，精構的程度尤勝於前者。有單刃刀刻的「鬼子拉去了她的丈夫」，小圓刀刻的「候渡」，石刻的「採果」，紙刻的「病兒」，精緻的「蕃女春米」等四幅，白描陰刻的「車廂裏」等。</p>
<p>許多人都推崇克萍的「辛勤者的遠景」，那的確是一幅色彩調和，寓意頗深，他的樂觀主義態的度，使這幅景像表現得極優美。「鋼水出爐」也是很有力量的一幅畫。李樺的陰　而帶力量的作風「快把他扶進來」，「失業後」，「慰問」，都是技巧純熟的作品。珂田的「餓」充分表現出饑餓的憤怒，李寸松的「造橡」，無論內容形式都寓有極濃的諷刺味，，趙延年的「想起了」也頗易引人同情。</p>
<p>展覽中有一套李志耕的迎續木刻「黃　子被迫登　背」，運頭帶尾二十五幅，刻製的形式是統一的，典型的描刻也很深，只是意義上並無緊洖的啣接，只能看作一篇小說的連　插畫而己。在運續木刻的製作上，我想還有很多地方需要再商　的。</p>
<p>從這裏看到套色木刻的增加。本來木刻應該是黑白分明的圖畫，最好是能以單色爲主的，單色木刻才能表現出木味刀味與明暗的對照，而成爲獨特的藝術。如蘇聯木刻中梭科洛夫的　色木刻「橋」，簡直與油畫無甚分別。</p>
<p>最後我在這裏爲木刻的前途祝福！木刻如果能够配合人民需要，加強民族形式和年　風的創造，樹起爲人民服務的旗幟，而不和其他少數「藝術家」的變成象牙塔中物，他的前途一定是無量的。</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Instructs Party Members to Concentrate Efforts on Mobilizing to Save the People, Fulfilling Duties and Not Taking Pride in Election</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] At 9:00 AM on the 10th, Generalissimo Chiang presided over the weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at the Central Party Headquarters. After the ceremony, he gave brief instructions regarding the responsibilities of party members and participation in elections, stating: "Currently, the communist bandits have not yet been suppressed, the people's suffering has not yet been alleviated, and the Three Principles of the People have not yet been realized. Comrades of our party should constantly remember their revolutionary responsibilities and devote all their efforts to the work of rescuing the nation from its crisis and relieving the people's suffering. I have repeatedly received tearful appeals from people victimized in areas recovered by our national army, as well as reports from officers and soldiers at the front lines who have witnessed firsthand the cruelty of the communist bandits and the suffering of the people in the bandit-controlled areas. The reality is far beyond what those of us safely in the rear can imagine. In the bandit-controlled areas, all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 58 are coerced into becoming 'militia' to replenish the bandit troops. They receive no training and are simply ordered to charge into battle to die. Once these able-bodied men are drafted into the 'militia,' they know that they have no hope of surviving more than three months. Yet, under their deception and cruel oppression, how can they escape? They can only feel regret, but it is too late. Therefore, in the Lu Zhong and Jiao Dong areas where our national army arrives, there is often no trace of human habitation for hundreds of miles. Recently, in Henan and other places, professors and the families of students in major universities and schools who are in the bandit-controlled areas have suffered unspeakable tortures and punishments from the communist bandits' 'cleansing' and 'struggle' campaigns. In addition to having their fathers, brothers, and sons turned into 'militia,' their sisters and daughters are forced into the communist army's 'comfort corps,' enduring all sorts of shameless and brutal acts that defy description. I can confidently say that if these inhumane communist bandits are not swiftly annihilated, then in three years, there will be no survivors left in the provinces of North China. Our party bears the responsibility of implementing the Three Principles of the People, building the nation, and saving our compatriots. Now that the communist bandits are rampant and the nation and people are suffering such a catastrophe, all party members must concentrate their efforts, strive hard, and not hesitate to sacrifice or endure hardship in order to quell the great chaos and save the people. Aside from the work of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, all personal honors and positions should not be considered at this time, lest we divert our focus and weaken our strength. Therefore, regarding the issue of elections, I believe that party members, except for those who are decided by the party to participate in the elections, should all focus on the work of mobilizing for the suppression of the rebellion, in order to contribute to the military efforts against the bandits. In particular, comrades in all party, government, and military departments who bear practical responsibilities should, with the spirit of 'worrying about the world's troubles before others and enjoying the world's pleasures after others,' dedicate themselves to their duties. They should not only not take pride in being elected, but also understand that participating in elections at this time and abandoning the responsibilities of a revolutionary party member is a disgrace to a revolutionary party member. This will allow us to leave more seats for friends from other parties and enlightened members of society to participate in politics. We must understand that constitutionalism and suppressing the rebellion are equally important, but suppressing the rebellion is the foundation for constitutionalism. We should fulfill our revolutionary responsibilities and not fight for personal rights. Only in this way can we demonstrate the spirit of our party comrades being selfless and sincere for the country and the people, and only then can we fulfill our party's mission of implementing the Three Principles of the People and building the nation."</p>
<h3>List of National Assembly Representative Candidates from the Kuomintang and Youth Party, Measures for Overseas Chinese Elections Modified by Government Order</h3>
<p>(This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 10th) The list of Kuomintang and Youth Party candidates for the National Assembly representatives was released by the Election Headquarters at 6:00 PM on the 10th. The list of the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet been released as it is still being negotiated. The Kuomintang's complete list includes a total of 1,758 names, including various candidates from 22 provinces, 10 cities, and 5 special groups. The Youth Party's list includes a total of 288 people from 20 provinces, 7 cities, and 4 special groups. The Election Headquarters immediately notified the election offices of each province and county by telegram, and also sent express mail to notify them of the released list. Furthermore, the list released today includes candidates from each province, city, and occupational group, but does not include those from the pacification zones and overseas Chinese. For Taiwan Province, the Kuomintang adopted a free election method, while the Youth Party nominated three candidates, which were released at the same time today. (The Kuomintang's list is on the first page, and the Youth Party's list is on the third page, left corner.)</p>
<p>(This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 10th) The list of Democratic Socialist Party candidates for the National Assembly representatives has not yet been finalized. Wu Tiecheng is in Shanghai negotiating with Zhang Junmai, but no conclusion has been reached. Wang Shixian of the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th, and then visited Chen Lifu with Xu Fulin and Yang Junming to exchange opinions. In the evening, Chen Lifu and Zheng Yanfen visited Xu again, but after several rounds of negotiations, no conclusion was reached.</p>
<h3>Jiang Yuntian Takes List to Nanjing, Insists on 260 Candidates, Lei Zhen Travels with Jiang</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, this city dispatch) The Democratic Socialist Party continues to insist on its previously proposed list of 260 National Assembly representative candidates. The original list was taken to Nanjing by Jiang Yuntian on the evening of the 10th. Before leaving, Jiang told reporters, "The result of the negotiations in Nanjing this time was that the number of candidates nominated by our party was reduced from 260 to 290, and some important figures in our party were removed. After repeated discussions within our party, we believe that it is difficult to accept this, so we have decided to submit the original list. If it still cannot be approved, then our party will have to withdraw from the election."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] It is reported that after the Kuomintang returned the list previously nominated by the Democratic Socialist Party for reconsideration and decided to increase the number of candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party by 15, the party still insisted that there were more than 30 "important figures" in certain regions who must be included as candidates. The Kuomintang side believes that the candidates already proposed in these regions are all outstanding party members, so it has stated that it cannot make any further concessions, but it has agreed to make concessions in certain regions, to which the Democratic Socialist Party replied that there were no suitable candidates to be nominated. According to reliable sources, the Democratic Socialist Party has 191 candidates arranged by the Kuomintang, and the remaining vacancies have been promised to be filled in the pacification zones. However, the Democratic Socialist Party still insists on its request to add more than 30 more candidates, which has led to several rounds of negotiations without reaching an agreement.</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Spokesperson Discusses Assisting Allied Parties in Elections</h3>
<p>[Another dispatch] A Kuomintang spokesperson stated: "The list submitted by the Kuomintang this time has gone through the procedures of reporting at the county level, review at the provincial level, and a bottom-up process. Finally, it was solemnly decided by the central government, which was a complicated process that took a lot of time. In order to facilitate the election of candidates from allied parties, the Kuomintang had to repeatedly discuss almost every region before reaching an appropriate solution. One characteristic of the list submitted by the Kuomintang this time is that it includes comrades from various industries and fields in various places, which will inevitably reduce their chances of participating in the election. This spirit of valuing national interests and sacrificing the individual should be praised by the people. The Generalissimo of our party will give them separate commendations to honor their virtue of concession."</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 10th] Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Headquarters, met with reporters at the Election Headquarters at 6:00 PM on the 10th after announcing the list of Kuomintang and Youth Party National Assembly representative candidates, and gave a speech stating: The government has three hopes for the elections in various places: 1. Establish good order, 2. Implement government laws and regulations, 3. Express the will of the people. If the election agencies at all levels can achieve these three hopes, then the election and voting can proceed smoothly and achieve a democratic election. Zhang added: The lists of the Kuomintang and Youth Party announced today are those that were submitted first and will be announced first. Those that continue to be submitted will be released successively in the future.</p>
<p>Zhang also said: According to the provisions of the Election Law, only those who have registered and legally signed can be candidates, and non-candidates cannot participate in the election. Currently, in addition to the nominations by political parties, there are still more than 20,000 people legally nominated in various places. As of now, there are also about 10,000 legally registered occupational groups.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the election of overseas Chinese, due to various difficulties, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is now ordered by the National Government to modify the measures. If the place of residence of the overseas Chinese can legally hold elections, it will be held in accordance with the law, otherwise, it will be postponed.</p>
<p>Extreme Cold in Northeast, Dripping Water Freezes in Changji</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Shenyang dispatch, 10th] The weather in the Northeast is extremely cold. Dripping water freezes in Changji, and Shenyang has dropped to minus three degrees Celsius. The cold wind is piercing, and the battles on various fronts are greatly affected by the weather, but there is no hope of a halt.</p>
<h3>On the Procedural Issues of the German Peace Conference, Our Foreign Ministry Issues a Statement: Shall not be deemed valid without the consent of our government.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Regarding the report that the Soviet representative opposed the proposal by Britain, France, and the United States that China should be a co-convener of the German Peace Conference at the meeting of the deputies of the four foreign ministers in London, the Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on the evening of the 10th in response to inquiries from reporters: "On November 5th of this year, the Chinese government reiterated its repeatedly stated position on convening the German Peace Conference to the four countries of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. China believes that although the drafting of various European peace treaties has been designated by the Potsdam Agreement to be undertaken by the countries that signed the surrender terms, the organization of the peace conference and which country should convene it have never been authorized to any member of the Council of Foreign Ministers to handle on its own, so it should be decided jointly by the entire Council of Foreign Ministers. The Chinese government's position on this matter has always been supported by Britain, France, and the United States, which shows that it is fair and reasonable. As a member of the Council of Foreign Ministers, China insists on participating in the decision of all procedural issues regarding the German Peace Conference. Any resolution shall not be deemed valid without the consent of the Chinese government."</p>
<h3>National Army Firmly Defends Shenbei, Kefaku, Kangping, and Shijiazhuang</h3>

Officials say that the bandit army attacking Shijiazhuang has suffered more than 2,500 casualties to date, and more than 1,000 rifles and machine guns have been captured. The National Army's bombing and strafing by more than 100 aircraft day and night has boosted the morale of the defending troops in Shijiazhuang.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch, 10th] The Battle of Shijiazhuang passed another tragic night yesterday. The communist bandits launched six fierce attacks, all of which were repelled. The air force dispatched planes all night, dropping flares over the bandit army's positions and bombing and strafing them, causing several large fires. All the bandit artillery positions were destroyed. The air force continued to be dispatched on the evening of the 9th, with more than 200 aircraft.

<h3>Marshall Plans Economic Aid to China, Drafts Concrete Proposals for Submission to Congress</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall, in a hearing before the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress on the 10th, in addition to requesting Congress to provide $597,000,000 in emergency aid to Europe before March 31st, announced that he is drafting a "concrete proposal for economic aid to China" for early submission. Marshall made this statement in response to questions from Republican leaders who demanded that China be included in any temporary aid plan. While most of Marshall's report concerned European issues, he emphasized: "The situation in China continues to be of deep concern to us, and we should provide some economic aid and assistance to its government and people." Marshall also stated, "The United States and other major world powers recognize President Chiang's National Government as the sole legitimate government of China." This is reportedly the first statement by a principal member of the U.S. government regarding U.S. policy towards China.</p>
<p>Regarding the China portion, the full text of Marshall's report is as follows: "The situation in China continues to deeply concern us. The civil war is expanding and intensifying. The Chinese Communists are using weapons to attempt to control vast areas of China. The United States and all major world powers recognize the National Government of China as the sole legitimate government of China. Only the Chinese government and people can resolve its fundamental problems and restore China to its rightful position as a major stabilizing force in the Far East." However, we can still provide assistance. Given our long-standing, continuous record of friendship and cooperation with China, we should provide some economic aid to the Chinese people and government. A concrete proposal is being drafted for early submission.</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 10th Broadcast: Washington report, Marshall, in his address to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress, did not specify the amount or timing of the aid plan for China. However, Under Secretary of State Lovett told reporters that he doubted the aid proposal would be submitted to a special session of Congress. Lovett indicated that the aid plan would include short-term assistance.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Post-Relief Affairs Committee —May It Not Repeat the Mistakes of UNRRA and CNRRA—</h3>
<p>The Post-Relief Affairs Committee, which will take over the remaining matters after the closure of UNRRA and CNRRA, has had its organizational regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, before General Rooks, the Director of UNRRA, returned to his country, he told reporters: "The relief work of UNRRA and CNRRA will end on December 31st of this year. After the closure, the post-relief work, in addition to the establishment of a Post-Relief Affairs Committee by the Chinese government, will also be jointly managed by a Custody Committee separately established with five members each from Chinese officials, social elites, and foreign personnel. Most of the remaining relief materials after the closure of UNRRA and CNRRA will be transferred to the Post-Relief Affairs Committee. A portion, such as fishing boats and fishing equipment, will be sold to private enterprises. The CNRRA Highway Transportation Administration and Water Transportation Administration will be closed simultaneously with CNRRA, while the Air Transport Administration's fate is yet to be decided." It is evident that the United Nations' relief efforts in China still require the Chinese government to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in Chinese administration is that each department only focuses on vertical systems and does not cooperate horizontally. Because of the vertical system, the affiliated enterprises become all-encompassing, but in the whole system, there is a sense of redundancy. Because of the unwillingness to cooperate horizontally, there are many unnecessary frictions and disputes between departments, and in terms of administrative efficiency, there is inevitably a waste of human and material resources. Even in terms of the administration and business of UNRRA and CNRRA, their scope of work should have been limited to the distribution of relief materials, but they insisted on handling the utilization of the materials themselves. For example, the reconstruction work in the flooded areas could have been delegated to the Ministry of Water Resources, with UNRRA or CNRRA consulting on the principles; the work of fisheries, mechanized farming, agricultural tool manufacturing, and rural industrial demonstration could have been entrusted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, with UNRRA or CNRRA assigning experts to provide guidance; the transportation and warehousing of materials could have been entrusted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Highway Administration, the Railway Administration, and the airline companies, with UNRRA or CNRRA strengthening their equipment. However, UNRRA and CNRRA did not do this, but insisted on handling all kinds of enterprises from beginning to end. What was the result? Now, as they are closing, we can review their past achievements and find various facts to prove that: the coordination was too poor, not only did it not achieve the effect of cooperation, but also caused unnecessary disputes, and many materials could not be fully utilized as a result. The enterprises they ran were too formalistic and lacked overall planning. Many temporary enterprises were discontinued due to their own closure, resulting in wasted efforts. Proportionally, administrative expenses were more than management expenses, and management expenses were more than enterprise expenses. Although there were some achievements, the cost was too high. There were too many guests and foreign entities. Many enterprises often became situations where the guest usurped the role of the host, hindering the advancement of the enterprise. If UNRRA and CNRRA had considered the consequences and had a good organization and reasonable scope at the time of their establishment, their achievements would have been more than this!</p>
<p>"Learn from the past to guide the future." As the Post-Relief Affairs Committee is about to replace UNRRA and CNRRA, the author dares to point out the past shortcomings and place expectations on the future. In terms of organization: In addition to the Post-Relief Affairs Committee, there is also a Advisory Custody Committee jointly responsible. Referring to the past organization, the relationship between the Advisory Custody Committee and the Post-Relief Affairs Committee seems to be the relationship between UNRRA and CNRRA, and referring to the organization of business institutions, it seems to be the supervisory board of a company. If the legislators believe this is necessary, they should also ensure that this Advisory Custody Committee only plays the role of approving and implementing principles, and should not be "jointly responsible" as General Rooks said, so that the staff will not have a sense of "three public officials in one country." It must be understood that multi-party checks and balances are the biggest obstacle to administration. It is hoped that the post-relief affairs will be changed for the better. In terms of administration: We demand to obtain the greatest results with the least human and material resources, especially in post-relief affairs. No matter what the source of funding is, increasing administrative efficiency by one point is equivalent to gaining one point of success for the enterprise, and saving one penny means that society gains one point of relief. The so-called undistributed relief materials must be distributed as soon as possible, and must not be left piled up in warehouses; the unfinished matters distributed in various places should be transferred to the local governments for separate handling, and no new institutions should be established to increase the burden of administrative expenses; guests and foreign entities should be retained if they should be retained, and should be dismissed if they can be dismissed, and should not be allowed to invest and disperse arbitrarily, consuming relief funds and causing them to complain. In terms of enterprises: The Post-Relief Affairs Committee does not need to handle permanent enterprises and enterprises managed by other departments. Because General Rooks's proposed "other matters such as fishing boats and fishing equipment in the fishing management area, except for a small portion reserved for the establishment of small fishing companies and related pier factories and repair shops, most of them will be sold to private enterprises in succession" plan really needs to be reconsidered. Other matters such as highway teams, water transportation teams, and air transportation teams should also be transferred to the business organizations under the Ministry of Communications as soon as possible, and there is no need to set up separate institutions after the closure to disperse the country's human and material resources. In short, since the Post-Relief Affairs Committee is responsible for continuing the distribution of relief materials, its work should focus on distribution. As for how to use them, if it only provides well-intentioned guidance, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort, so why bother to manage it all by itself?</p>
<p>Whether our administrative efficiency can be improved will be determined by this reorganization of the Post-Relief Affairs Committee.</p>

<h3>Case of Military Flour Transported to Tianjin, Three Supervisors File Impeachment</h3>
<p>(Continued from the previous page) Briefly stated: Regarding Rong Yiren's part, Rong was entrusted by the government to purchase wheat and grind flour on its behalf. The labor and profit that each manufacturer should receive were stipulated in the contract. The government had already taken care of the interests of the manufacturers. However, Rong disregarded the contract stipulations and extracted too much wheat and second-grade flour, resulting in poor quality that was unfit for consumption. In addition, he swapped domestic flour for foreign flour, swapped foreign flour for navy flour, and violated the government's intention to purchase on its behalf by selling a portion of the wheat purchased on behalf to manufacturers. He disregarded the greater good, ignored the interests of the government, and engaged in trickery and embezzlement. He should be held criminally responsible, and it is proposed that he be handed over to the relevant court for investigation and prosecution. Regarding Ye Xinming's part, Ye did not ask about the quality of the flour milled by the Maoxin Company. When ordered to allocate military flour, he simply transferred the bill of lading issued by the company to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Port Command and directly extracted it from the manufacturer. He neglected his duties and did not fulfill his responsibilities. Furthermore, the flour did not meet the prescribed standards, but the director stated in his report to the Storage and Transportation Department of the Ministry of Food: "The color of this flour is slightly yellow, and the quality meets the standards prescribed by the Military Grain Quality Improvement Measures." He deliberately shielded the manufacturer. If he was not colluding for fraudulent purposes, why would he make such a false report? Not only was he derelict in his duties, but he was also in violation of the law. He should be held criminally responsible, and it is proposed that he also be handed over to the court for investigation. Regarding Shi Beiheng and Ju Zhiyi's parts, Shi and Ju were ordered to receive the flour, but they did not take it for inspection and shipped it directly. They were negligent and derelict in their duties. Their claim that there was no time for a thorough inspection and that they could only conduct spot checks was not supported by any official documents. Shi and Ju are highly suspected of fraud. It is proposed that they also be handed over to the relevant court for investigation and interrogation. Regarding Yu Zhongyun, ..., and Xian De's parts, Yu, ..., and Xian were ordered to jointly investigate this case, but they did not thoroughly investigate and clarify the responsibility for the case. They were negligent in their duties, and the flour composition stated in the report (which differed from what Engineer Li of Fuxin Company stated) constituted a report that was unfaithful to their duties due to following personal connections and disregarding facts. Their violations of law and dereliction of duty were serious. It is proposed that they be handed over to the relevant court for investigation and prosecution. Regarding the Ministry of Food's part, the ministry entrusted Maoxin Company's Rong Yiren to purchase a large amount of wheat and produce a large amount of flour on its behalf. Such a major matter should have been handled with caution and responsible supervision to avoid abuses. However, it entrusted Rong Yiren to handle it all by himself in a private entrusted manner. Its lack of careful supervision and failure to comply with the instructions of the former president to completely reform the flour production were also improper. It should be corrected.</p>
<h3>Xi'an Bank of China Hoarding Rice and Flour Seized</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Xi'an, 10th] The Xi'an branch of the Bank of China had more than 1,900 bags of government-stored rice and flour in its warehouse, and another 500 bags in a flour mill, which were seized by the Supervisory Commissioner of Jin-Shaan. The matter is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Limits on Japanese Industry, Chinese Reparations Committee Formulates Principles</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The issue of limiting the level of Japanese industry has been concluded after the Reparations Committee invited experts to conduct research. The basic principle is to limit the recovery of Japanese industry. The limit is not based on a specific year, but on the individual level of each industry. For example, the textile industry, the steel industry, and the kiln industry have been studied in detail by experts and subjected to strict limitations. This information will be used as a reference for the Chinese representatives when signing a peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Flow of the Qiantang River, Seawall Project Progressing Smoothly, Report by Deputy Director Wang of the Seawall Engineering Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] The Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau has been working for a year, and the projects in various places have achieved their expected goals. Deputy Director Wang reported at the commemorative meeting: On the north bank, from Jianshan in Haining to Jiuzhou ..., sand has been accumulated over eighty, eight miles wide, covering an area of 240,000 acres. The strong current along the seawall from Qibao to Toubao has been diverted 50 meters away from the seawall. On the south bank, the sand has accumulated over fifty miles long and six miles wide from Xinwan in Xiaoshan to Tou ..., covering an area of 110,000 acres, exceeding the land within the collapsed area. Nansha has been secured as a result. Now, the downstream flow of the Qiantang River has returned to the middle stream. During small tides, the water outside the seawall is less than an inch deep. During large tides, the tide head follows the center, and the remaining waves near the seawall are less than a foot high. This is a rare and favorable phenomenon in a hundred years. In the future, the governance project still needs to treat both the symptoms and the root causes. It is necessary to continue to repair the 2,700-meter-long damaged seawall and build diversion dikes and weirs to ensure that the accumulated sand beaches no longer change and that the formed channels do not shift.</p>
<h3>Chen Xueping Discusses Student Protests, Hopes to Maintain Stability of Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Chen Xueping, head of the Youth Department, recently spoke about the current student protests, saying: The atmosphere in Nanjing is still relaxed. Zhongda only boycotted classes for one day, and Jin Da has already resumed classes. The problem is still in Zhejiang University itself. Education authorities have expressed dissatisfaction with Zhejiang University President Zhu's neutral attitude. In fact, Zhu has a long history of service in education and is a first-class president in the country. Chen is deeply concerned about conflicts between local military authorities and schools. He sincerely hopes that students can understand the situation, maintain the stability of the schools, and that the government will not take extreme measures against the schools.</p>

<h3>U.S. Congressional Foreign Affairs Committees Review Aid to Europe Marshall Personally Explains Emergency Aid Plan Requires $597 Million All Countries Must Provide Self-Help Guarantees</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Dispatch: Secretary of State Marshall addressed both the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees today, requesting that Congress allocate $597 million for emergency aid to Europe before March 31 of next year. He estimates that an additional $7 billion will be needed in the fifteen months after March 31. The long-term cost of European recovery will be between $16 billion and $20 billion. Marshall stated, "To restore Europe to its health is the goal of major powers (except the Soviet Union)." Marshall declared in a straightforward tone, "For its own reasons, the Soviet Union does not share this goal with us." Marshall's estimate of the long-term cost of aid to Europe is higher than that of the Harriman Committee report. The Harriman Committee's estimate for the four-year plan was $17 billion. Marshall said that it is currently impossible to estimate an accurate figure, but in order to "truly" meet the emergency needs of France, Italy, and Austria, provisional aid of $597 million is necessary. Marshall continued: After the emergency period, $1.5 billion will be needed from March 31 to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, and another $6 billion in the entire year beginning on July 1.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 10th Dispatch: Washington News, Marshall believes in his speech that the situation in Europe is serious, and the United States must quickly provide Europe with assistance. He said that economic assistance cannot guarantee "automatic success," but "I believe the hope of success is very great." Regarding the Soviet claim that the purpose of the Marshall Plan is to control Europe, Marshall strongly denied it, claiming that this plan has no evil intentions, and its purpose is to assist foreign production and construction, and does not threaten any country. He said that U.S. assistance should take the form of both grants and loans. Marshall officially revealed for the first time that the beneficiary countries should provide certain guarantees, that is, this assistance should be used to achieve economic recovery as quickly as possible. Efforts must be made to stabilize the economy, develop production (especially coal and food), and reduce trade barriers.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The chairmen's meeting of the two House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees does not intend to ask Marshall questions today. After Marshall's report is completed, the two committees will hold individual meetings to determine the procedures for listening to opinions from all parties. This stage of work will take about a week. Cabinet members such as Under Secretary of State Lovett, Secretary of Agriculture Anderson, Secretary of the Treasury Snyder, and Secretary of Commerce Harriman will all attend the meeting to present their views. When the full Congress convenes on November 17, President Truman will personally attend to announce his plans for foreign aid and domestic inflation control. The U.S. government and experienced members of Congress expect that there will be no major opposition to the emergency aid plan in Congress. Although the amount of aid will be carefully considered, this transitional aid plan will definitely be passed before Christmas in any case. As for Marshall's long-term aid plan for Europe, in addition to possible discussions on the amount, there should be no obstacles.</p>
<h3>Democratic Leader Connally Advocates That Aid to Europe Should Not Establish Another Agency The State Department Should Directly Supervise and Implement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] Senator Foreign Affairs Committee Democratic Leader Connally announced today that the foreign aid bill should be directly supervised and implemented by the State Department. A supervisor should be appointed to submit reports to President Truman through the State Department. Connally's remarks represent the government's view, which contradicts the Republican Party's request to establish another agency to take charge of it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 10th] It is informally rumored here that two people may be appointed to the world's most important position, namely the general manager of the Marshall Plan. The most popular candidate is former Senator La Follette, who is the author of the report recommending the establishment of this position and other proposals related to the aid to Europe program. Another person who is considered possible and suitable for this position by relevant parties is the current Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas.</p>
<h3>Harriman Report Good Response in Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] After the publication of the Harriman Committee's report on the Marshall Plan, the reaction in Europe has been generally welcoming. The details are as follows: France: Government officials are generally favorable, but the Communist Party continues to criticize it; Denmark: Political circles expressed surprise at the reduction in the amount of aid, but felt that it was better than no aid at all; Italy: Left-wing newspapers paid little attention to the report, while other newspapers strongly promoted it; Netherlands: Finance Minister Lieftingk said: After the reduction in aid to Europe, if wages and prices are not strictly controlled, inflation in Europe will be unavoidable; Greece: Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldaris said: The sooner the Marshall Plan is implemented, the sooner Europe can obtain freedom and security; Czechoslovakia: The only newspaper to comment was the army newspaper "Lido Bao," which said that the report intends to rebuild German industry and blindly opposes communism.</p>
<h3>Thailand's Bloodless Coup Successful Aphaiwong Forms New Cabinet Will Promulgate New Constitution to Restore King's Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 10th] Aphaiwong, who served as Prime Minister twice in 1944 and 1946, has been appointed as the new Prime Minister of Thailand today. A Privy Council has been formed by former Regent Chana, former National Assembly member Sevi, and General Adul, Arongkorn and Lieutenant General Xie Yide, to preside over state affairs. King Bhumibol will return from Switzerland next month. The Privy Council has immediately promulgated a constitution to restore part of the power that was taken from the King in 1932. The new constitution was drafted by former Prime Minister and Ambassador to the United States, Pramoj. According to the new constitution, the parliament will continue to adopt a bicameral system, but the upper house members will be appointed by the King instead of being elected by the people. The new Prime Minister will announce the list of cabinet members.</p>
<h3>International Communist Information Bureau Will Hold First Meeting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Warsaw, 9th] According to authoritative sources: The Communist Information Bureau in Belgrade is scheduled to hold its first meeting in early December. The main items on the agenda will be the status of the French and Czech Communist Parties. International Communist leaders are clearly uneasy about the recent developments in these two countries. It is expected that the meeting may decide on the actions that the French Communist Party should take once de Gaulle seizes power. In addition, the participation of the Ukrainian Communist Party in the Information Bureau will be formally approved. The person in charge of the Communist Information Bureau is said to have been elected by the Yugoslavian Mi Fanova Dalaslei as the permanent secretary of the organization. The chairman of the first meeting will either be the leader of the Polish Communist Party, Władysław, or the new Romanian Foreign Minister, Ms. Paul. According to the draft charter of the organization, the position of chairman will be rotated monthly.</p>
<h3>Stalin Reiterates That the Soviet Union Does Not Want War Washington Believes That the Soviet Union Seems to Be Temporarily Unwilling to Communize All of Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Sydney, 9th] The Australian-Soviet Association published a report on the recent travels in Eastern Europe and meeting with Marshal Stalin by Jensen, the deputy bishop of Canterbury, England. It is said that Stalin told them that the Soviet Union fully understands the current international problems and is determined not to start a war. Stalin said: "The Soviet Union does not want war, but wants to maintain friendly relations with Western countries. The Soviet Union fully recognizes the difficulty of peacefully resolving various problems in peacetime, but the Soviet Union is still willing to seek peaceful solutions and believes that they will be obtained."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] In view of the recent intensification of the Eastern European countries' purge of anti-communist parties, diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union will temporarily shift its efforts to communize all of Europe and devote itself to strengthening the Communist Party's control over Nan, Bao, A, Czech, Bo, Hungary, and Romania. As for France and Italy, the Communist Party will only have the opportunity to seize power when there is a severe shortage of food and fuel this winter. However, even so, the Communist Party's control will inevitably be fragile, because the economic and political habits of Western and Eastern Europe are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>British Military Authorities in Germany Issue Secret Orders to Deal with the Situation Carefully</p>
<p>[United Press, Dusseldorf, Germany, 9th] It was learned today that the British occupying authorities have secretly ordered military government officials not to participate in the anti-communist movement in the U.S. occupied zone. The British believe that "attacking the Communist Party is indistinguishable from attacking the Soviet Union." The U.S. governor recently announced that the U.S. military will respond to the Communist Party's accusations with an active anti-communist movement, but the British side will maintain a passive attitude, at least until the end of the four-nation foreign ministers meeting in London in November.</p>
<h3>The United States Government and the Public Attach Importance to the Threat of Inflation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] President Truman admitted frankly that the threat of inflation greatly undermines the prosperity of the United States. This statement shows that the Congress will face a major economic task when it holds meetings on November 17 this year and January 3 next year. Although the emergency aid to Europe plan and the Marshall Plan are both of great global significance, the inflation debate is still the most important domestic issue, because the United States will hold a general election next year, so this matter is particularly important.</p>
<h3>US Opposes Dividing Germany; If the Four Foreign Ministers Conference Fails, Plans to Discuss Economic Agreements with Germany Separately</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The Foreign Policy Association recently released a report by Paul Nitze, former administrative advisor to General Clay. In the report, Nitze warned that if the Four Foreign Ministers Conference results in Germany being divided into Soviet and Western zones, "we might as well dig trenches early to await the inevitable conflict."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 9th] A spokesperson for the US delegation at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference announced today that the United States has a plan to sign a separate economic agreement with Germany if the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the German peace treaty fails. This plan has also been privately discussed with the United Kingdom.</p>
<h3>US Expresses Deep Concern Over the Situation in Greece</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] New York, 10th, Broadcast: Washington, message. President Truman told Congress today that thanks to US aid, "Greece remains free," but Greece's economic difficulties have not fundamentally improved, and the military situation is even worse. Truman expressed deep concern that the internal factors of Greece's economic and political instability still remain.</p>
<h3>Conflicts Between Left and Right Factions in Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Rome, 9th] In four cities in northern Italy on the evening of the 9th, left-wing and right-wing elements exchanged fire with machine guns and grenades. Right-wing elements attacked the residences of "red elements," while left-wing elements accused fascists of being allowed to operate openly without police interference. Miraglia, a far-right member of the Italian Social Movement, was attacked by five unidentified thugs. Miraglia had attended a hearing opposing the trial of a Milan communist newspaper. A group of thugs near Miraglia attacked the residences of industrialists with machine guns and grenades. Shooting incidents also occurred in Novena and Monchai at the same time.</p>
<h3>Philippine General Election Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 10th] Four million registered Philippine voters will participate in the country's first national election since independence tomorrow. Eight senators, 101 governors, 164 provincial councilors, 76 mayors, and thousands of municipal councilors will be elected. Both the Liberal Party (the ruling party) and the Nationalist Party (the minority party) are confident of victory on the eve of the election. The atmosphere of the national campaign is very tense, especially in some areas where party candidates are competing fiercely. Persecution, fraud, and violence arising from the election continue to occur.</p>
<h3>Split Within French Labor Union; General Confederation of Labor Leader Condemns Communist Manipulation of Union Affairs; Major Blow to the Strength of the French Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 10th] A highly noteworthy split has occurred in the French labor movement. Two hundred leaders of the Communist Party-controlled "General Confederation of Labor" (France's largest national labor union organization) issued a declaration today, denouncing the Communist Party's use of union organizations to achieve its political goals. At the same time, they expressed support for the Marshall Plan and declared their determination to take action to democratize the General Confederation of Labor.</p>
<p>Jouhaux, one of the two deputy secretaries-general of the General Confederation of Labor, is the leader of the anti-communist leaders in the labor union. He has just returned to Paris from New York. According to well-informed sources, Jouhaux felt uneasy about the General Confederation of Labor's excessive involvement in national political affairs, so he decided to take on a more active role in the French labor movement. After the French Communist Party became politically isolated, it relied solely on the General Confederation of Labor to maintain its power. Therefore, if the general workers can understand that opposing the Marshall Plan means rejecting improved industrial standards, the position of the Communist Party will inevitably be shaken.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th] The declaration issued by 200 minority leaders of the French General Confederation of Labor has aroused great interest here. This move not only introduces the Communist Party issue into a stage of open conflict, but also may overturn the balance between communist and non-communist elements in the World Federation of Trade Unions. In the past, if there were disputes within the union, they were all resolved by Jouhaux. Now that Jouhaux himself is leading the issuance of this declaration, it can be seen that the split is becoming more obvious and certain.</p>
<p>Japanese Mail to Our Country Must Not Use "Shina"; Otherwise, the Post Office Will Not Accept It</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] The Ministry of Communications announced: All mail sent to the Northeast must indicate the Northeast of the Republic of China. If "Manchuria" is written, it will not be accepted. Letters that write "Shina" without writing the Republic of China will also not be accepted. This is just one of the efforts of the Japanese to eliminate the remnants of past imperialism in all aspects of life. However, the general public's mentality still fails to understand this. Even when members of the Japanese Diet give speeches, they often use the word "Shina." This action is not intentional but a phenomenon that the habits of militarism are difficult to change.</p>
<h3>Indian Army Takes Over Junagadh Administration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] Authoritative sources: A battalion of the Indian Dominion Army, assisted by medium tanks, entered Junagadh City, the capital of Junagadh State on the east coast of the Indian Peninsula, tonight. It has accepted the city's administration, and no accidents have occurred. The Indian army entered at the request of the Junagadh ruler's administrative committee. It is reported that the state may change its previous promise to merge with Pakistan and decide to merge with the Indian Dominion. The Indian army has also taken over Veraval, Junagadh's first major port, and the headquarters of the Junagadh State Army.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government to Hold Economic Inspection Meeting Today to Discuss Handling of Sealed and Hoarded Paper; Rice Merchants Summoned to Accept Police Bureau's Advice</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Recently, commodity prices in this city seem to be fluctuating again. A reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday. Wu said that the recent price problem is not yet serious. Because rice from the countryside is arriving on the market in the evening, rice prices have been very stable in recent days. Moreover, rice produced on both sides of the Yangtze River will soon arrive in Shanghai, so the current situation is still optimistic. For the sake of prevention, the municipal government has decided to hold an economic inspection meeting today to discuss the issue of seized and hoarded paper. Legitimate merchants will be allowed to unseal their goods. The previously proposed method of restricting paper storage to no more than three months would have too much impact on paper merchants and would be difficult to implement. Therefore, future work will focus on cracking down on hoarding by people outside the industry. Detailed measures will be discussed today.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The new Chief of the Economic Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, Cao Maoliang, summoned the heads of the North and South Rice Markets to the bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday and gave them advice in person. Those who attended included Hu Wen'an, Zhang Yin'nan, and Qiu Fuxiang from the South Rice Market, and Xu Songren and Zha Bao'san from the North Rice Market. Chief Cao gave two pieces of advice: 1. Assist in preventing unreasonable increases in rice prices, and require the Rice Merchants Association to report daily details of the quantity of rice sold, the quantity of rice in storage, the source of rice, and prices at the place of production. 2. It is hoped that the Rice Merchants Association will strictly abide by: (A) If commodity prices have not risen, rice prices must not lead the price increase. (B) If rice prices at the place of production have not risen, rice prices in this city must not be arbitrarily raised. The rice merchants expressed their acceptance of Chief Cao's advice and will transfer the notification to industry members to comply.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Economic Section of the Police Bureau cracked down on a secret organization engaged in the black market for gold and US dollars. This organization was located upstairs at 95 Lloyd Road. When the economic police pushed open the door according to the address, they saw two people busy answering the phone, and there were records similar to market quotations on the table. While the police were conducting the search, they ordered the personnel at the site to hand over the gold and US dollars. One of them, named Wang Cheng, took out four small bars of gold and 300 US dollars from a secret place. At the same time, a safe was found, as well as many other pieces of evidence. At this time, a person named Li Amao came to the site, and three large bars of gold were found on his body. Wang Cheng and Li Amao were taken to the bureau together. The person in charge of the site, Wen Zhiou, will also be summoned for questioning.</p>

However, the Kuomintang sincerely hopes that more journalists from the Minqing Party and social elites will have the opportunity to participate in the National Assembly. Therefore, when nominating party journalists in the eastern region, it was strictly limited. It is also heard that there is a general consideration of legislators and National Assembly representatives, with the principle of one nomination per newspaper (except for national female journalists). He understands the Central Committee's difficulties and, in order to show absolute obedience to party discipline, decided to give up.</p>

In order to raise funds for winter relief in this city, the Municipal Council had a resolution to hold charity horse racing. A reporter visited Mayor Wu yesterday to inquire about the preparations of the municipal government. According to Mayor Wu: The horse racing matter has not yet been settled. Because the municipal government has not yet consulted with the Jockey Club. The mayor expressed to the Jockey Club authorities that the venue has not been used for a long time and is quite damaged, and the municipal government must approve its continuous use for several years before it can be repaired at all, and it is considered absolutely impossible, because the government has already decided to buy the horse racing venue. However, the method of purchase has not yet been decided, either by issuing public bonds or by adopting land exchange methods, and it remains to be discussed at length. Moreover, the venue repairs require a certain amount of time, and whether there are problems with horse racing is also unknown. Therefore, whether horse racing can become a reality this winter is not yet known.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu, the winter relief funds for this city this year need at least 60 billion yuan, and fundraising will begin immediately. The previous Senate meeting had resolved to add 20% to the entertainment tax, but film producers and theater industry unanimously opposed it. The municipal government decided to convene representatives of film producers and those in charge of the theater industry association today to talk, hoping that they would serve the poor masses and accept it.</p>
<h3>Aerial Surveying Produces Charts and Tables</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Government was ordered by the Executive Yuan to measure and produce a 1:10,000 topographic map of the city, it transferred the order to the Aerial Surveying Team of the Land Administration Bureau to carry out topographic surveying, and the Public Works Bureau was responsible for surveying. Now, all the surveying has been completed, and charts and tables have been produced.</p>
<p>Fourteen Houses Must be Demolished</p>
<p>(Our Correspondent) Regarding the problem of widening and demolishing houses on Tianmu Road, according to Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau yesterday: The widening project of this road is carried out in accordance with the resolution of the Senate. The northern 21 meters were completed as early as May of this year, and the southern 14-meter road boundary was also stipulated in the Public Works Bureau era before the war. Now, in order to sympathize with the people's difficulties, it has been decided to demolish 14 houses first before the 15th of this month, and the houses to be demolished in these 14 houses are only half of the original houses. After the demolition, the residents can still use the remaining half of the houses for business. All other houses are allowed to be demolished in two installments before the end of February and April 15 next year, so as to pass the Lunar New Year. The municipal government has allocated funds to the Civil Affairs Bureau for the relocation fees of all the residents of all the houses, which will be distributed by the district office. All of the above 14 houses that should have half of their houses demolished first are limited to be demolished before the 15th of this month. If they do not obey the order to demolish, the Public Works Bureau will have no choice but to send workers and police to demolish them on their behalf. It is deeply hoped that the residents of all the houses to be demolished on Tianmu Road should understand that this method will not affect their business during the New Year and that they can automatically demolish them within the time limit, so as to facilitate construction and benefit transportation.</p>
<p>Each District of the Municipality Produces One National Assembly Representative; The Legislative Yuan Believes There is No Legal Basis</p>
<p>The senates of the five municipalities directly under the central government, Shanghai, Qingdao, Shenyang, Hankou, and Chongqing, telegraphed the National Government and the Executive Yuan on September 5, believing that the status of the municipalities directly under the central government is the same as that of a province, and that the valley areas under their jurisdiction are the same as a county in a province. Therefore, the production of National Assembly representatives in the municipalities directly under the central government is also requested to be approved in accordance with this ratio, so that each district produces one representative. After detailed discussion by the Constitutional Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan, it was believed that "the production of National Assembly representatives, the Constitution takes counties and cities as units, and there is no distinction between municipalities directly under the central government and municipalities directly under the province. As for the equal district tools of the districts of municipalities directly under the central government and counties and cities, their nature is also different. The requested item seems to have no legal basis." This opinion was passed by the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 21st of last month. The National Government's Civil Service Department has notified the senates of each municipality directly under the central government to check.</p>
<h3>Midnight Robbery in Zhabei, Two People Shot and Injured; Double-Gun Gang Robs Rice Store</h3>
<p>At about 1:20 AM on the 9th, at the home of Zhang Junkuang, a resident of No. 13 Sujia Lane at the end of Datong Road in Zhabei, seven thieves suddenly rushed in. One of the thieves, holding a box cannon, fired a shot at Zhang Junkuang's mother, Chen, penetrating her left foot. Zhang Junkuang took the opportunity to climb out of the skylight and onto the roof, shouting "robbers." The thieves knew they had failed and struggled to escape. At this time, Wu Zonghan, a tenant living in the flat in the backyard of the house, heard the alarm about the thieves, put on his clothes and went out to see, and met the thieves face to face. The thief holding the gun fired at Wu, and the bullet hit his left thigh, penetrating his knee. The thieves then fled to the east.</p>
<p>At about 7:00 PM the night before last, four thieves broke into the Sanmao Rice Store at No. 1000 Xietu Road, each holding a pistol. Two of them were each wearing two guns. A lot of gold jewelry and cash were robbed. After the thieves succeeded, they fled in a scramble. The owner, Lü Dianxiu, chased after them, and the thieves fired four shots in the dark alley, and Lü did not dare to chase after them.</p>
<h3>Today is the First Industrial Festival; Grand Celebration Meeting to be Held</h3>
<p>Today is the first Industrial Festival in our country's history. All factories in the city will fly flags today to celebrate, but in order not to violate the purpose of promoting production, there will be no holiday. The Municipal Industrial Association and various industrial trade associations have scheduled a grand celebration ceremony at the Xinxin First Building at 10:00 AM this morning, and invite leaders from various agencies, circles, and groups to socialize and enhance understanding. Industrial personnel will still gather for lunch at the original location at noon. In addition, special editions will be printed in various newspapers in this city to commemorate the occasion. The reason why the Industrial Festival was scheduled for today is that the National Industrial Association held its first general meeting in Beijing after the victory on this day last year. The representatives of the industrial circles who attended the meeting felt that it was of profound significance and worthy of permanent commemoration, so they presented a request to the government in the name of the general meeting to stipulate this day as the Industrial Festival.</p>

The degree of democracy in a country is reflected in the voter turnout rate. If 50% of the voters participate in this election, it will prove the success of this primary election. Therefore, all Kuomintang members, whether participating in the election or as voters, must act with a bright, upright, open, and legal attitude, and each person must go to the polling place to vote and persuade relatives and friends to support candidates from our party.

<h3>Having Practiced Tai Chi, He Has the Ability to Climb Walls: Xie Zhongmin Sentenced to Eight Years Imprisonment for Attempted Murder, Suspected of Having Other Motives for Sneaking into Neighbor's House</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Xie Zhongmin, a young man from Nanjing living at No. 26, Lane 236, Xiamen Road, squandered his savings from his previous silk business on singing and dancing, and became unemployed. Shunned by relatives and friends, he suffered a great mental shock. On the afternoon of the 16th of last month, he bought a pair of handcuffs, a hemp rope, a bag of cotton, and a pair of scissors. At 3:00 AM the next day, he carried a pistol, along with the aforementioned items, and sneaked to the front door of the Liu family next door. He first cut the telephone line, tied it into a knot, and used it to climb to the second-floor window, intending to commit illegal acts. The Liu couple noticed this and screamed. Xie fired a shot and fled. He was later captured by police officers near the North Zhejiang Road Bridge and sent to court on charges of banditry. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court held its first hearing. The defendant confessed: I am from Nanjing, 24 years old. I returned home at 10:00 PM on October 16th and lay down on the sofa in the living room. After a while, my mother returned from playing mahjong with friends, went upstairs to sleep, and I went out. I lingered in front of the Liu's house and then returned, going in and out five or six times. At this point, Judge Shen Tianbao questioned Xie, "You went in and out five or six times, were you having a nervous breakdown?"</p>
<p>The audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Xie replied, "I wasn't having a nervous breakdown, it was because I was too nervous. My pistol was given to me by Yoshida Shigeru of Japan. I wasn't going to rob the Liu family, I was going to scare him because Mr. Liu often spoke ill of me." Next, Liu Zhu Shi, the complainant, described the circumstances of Xie firing the gun that night. Then, witness Zhang Wenzheng described how he apprehended Xie and how he forcefully seized the gun. Finally, Xie Zhongmin's aunt testified that Xie was her nephew, whom she had raised since he was a child. His conduct was usually good, and she didn't know this would happen. Judge Shen then asked Xie Zhongmin about his wall-climbing skills.</p>
<p>Where did you learn them?</p>
<p>Xie replied, "I didn't learn them anywhere, I just practiced Tai Chi when I was young." After the defendant's lawyer made a defense, the court immediately pronounced the verdict, "Xie Zhongmin is sentenced to eight years imprisonment for attempted murder, and the pistol is confiscated." Xie was quite calm after hearing the verdict and walked out of the courtroom with large strides. Reporters visited several of Xie's neighbors yesterday. They said that Xie Zhongmin was actually the biological son of Xie Zhang Shi, and the Xie family was quite wealthy, so Xie would never commit theft. They suspected he had other motives for sneaking into his neighbor's house.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After Li Zhen, the red dancer known as the "Foreign Girl," had her residence broken into and clothes and other items stolen on the afternoon of the 9th, believing that she could vaguely identify the robbers, she accompanied six plainclothes police officers from the Changning Police Sub-bureau to the Xinhua Dance Hall on Edward Road at 10:00 PM last night to investigate. The dance floor was filled with dancers. Suddenly, the lights came on and the music stopped, causing widespread panic. The police officers searched one by one but found nothing. As they were about to leave, more than a dozen people in uniform crowded out of the hall. Two people were assigned to monitor each plainclothes officer, who explained that they were carrying out a mission, but the situation was very tense, resulting in the loss of three guns from the plainclothes officers. The entire scene was in turmoil, with people rushing to escape, and the glass of the front door was broken.

<h3>Xinsheng Bookstore Sued for Disobedience</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Although the "English-Chinese New Character Four-Use Dictionary" of Xinsheng Bookstore is in the midst of a dispute, it is still being published, and all those who pre-ordered it have already received their books. They have also declared in response to Jingwen Bookstore's lawsuit accusing them of copying the "English New Character Dictionary" and infringing on copyright that the three demands made by Jingwen are unacceptable, and they will demand that Jingwen withdraw the original case and decide to appeal. When Jingwen presented evidence of copied sample pages, Xinsheng had not yet published its book, and those sample pages are suspected of being stolen.

<h3>Relying Entirely on Touch to Understand the World: The School for the Blind Conscientiously Trains Children Deprived of Sight</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] According to a relatively reliable statistic, there are more than five million blind people in China today, but there are only more than fifty schools for training and educating the blind. Assuming that each school accommodates three hundred people, less than ten thousand people are being trained. The remaining millions who are forever separated from the light passively accept their tragic fate, allowing pale imagination to devour their unspoken lives.</p>
<p>Blind people are no less capable than sighted people in making contributions later in life. Song Guanlin, secretary to the outstanding Liu Hongsheng, Zhang Peixin, editor of the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, and Wu Guobiao, director of the National Association for the Blind, are all people who were deprived of their visual acuity by the Creator. However, after ten years of training at the school for the blind, they eventually made their way to St. John's University. Wu Guobiao even stayed in the United States for two years after graduating from St. John's, earning a degree from Columbia University before returning. Their achievements are worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>The achievements of the school for the blind in this area are worthy of admiration. Looking at the facilities within the school, one is even more amazed at their care and perseverance. On a flat road, there is an uneven slope every so often, marking that there is a crossroad ahead. All kinds of physical models have been designed to enable blind students to understand the true nature of the world through touch. Don't think this is a simple matter; there is no common sensory experience between the teacher and the student. It is entirely through these gropings and collisions that they construct a rudimentary universe in their consciousness that they have never experienced before.</p>

<h3>Intelligence Is Not Inferior</h3>
<p>At the school for the blind, the reporter saw a nine-year-old student named Shi Mingde, who is the only student in the school with a relatively wealthy family. According to him, the world is too unfamiliar to him, and he has no memory of his parents' appearance. Memory is entirely equal to a blank sheet of paper, but the only thing he can deduce is that fluorescent lights (daylight lamps) are brighter than electric lights. Another girl said: She spends more than ten hours a day knitting yarn, and her mind is filled with the marks of squares and patterns interwoven by long and short needles. Therefore, she seems to have the illusion that the world's space is also filled with squares and patterns. In addition, a 23-year-old blind student told the reporter: The accumulation of more than 20 years of life experience has cultivated in him the habit of doing everything slowly. Whether eating, walking, or urinating, he tries to do it as slowly as possible, because he believes that only slow movements can ensure that his goals are achieved smoothly.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will not look down on those blind people who have not received training and educational opportunities! Their intelligence is not inferior. The problem is that the Creator and society have let them down!</p>

<h3>A Riot Erupts in Shanghai Prison Over Yang Anren's Rice Porridge; Disturbance Calms Down, Warden Requests Punishment</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] To understand the truth behind the riot in Shanghai Prison over Yang Anren's rice porridge, a reporter visited Shanghai Prison authorities yesterday and interviewed Yang Anren and Zhan Sheng, the main figures in the Jin Chao case, for half an hour. Yang's hair was short and disheveled, with a full beard, wearing a prison cloth short shirt and trousers, and black cloth shoes. Regarding the riot, he said it was caused by the rice porridge, and that prisoner No. 202 and others used this as an excuse to demand compensation of two bottles of milk per person, totaling thousands of bottles for 4,000 people. However, Yang claimed that he did not pay any money. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, some prisoners had threatened to extort money, but Yang ignored them. He felt that it was unbearable to have intellectual criminals and third-rate gangsters imprisoned in the same place and hoped that there would be some reform.</p>
<p>Visiting Zhan Sheng at the prison hospital, Zhan wore a velvet hat and a black jacket, and had blue silk leggings. He was helped downstairs by someone. He said that he had been in the hospital for more than ten days due to high blood pressure, and was still receiving injections and medication. He had also eaten rice porridge in the past, exchanging his own staple food, sauces, and pickles for it. The riot occurred three days after he entered the hospital, so he did not know the details and did not pay any money. When he entered the prison, other prisoners had intended to insult him and extort money, but he endured and did not resist.</p>
<p>Report and Handling Process</p>
<p>The riot in Shanghai Prison was quelled by the suppression of Guard Section Chief Ding Baocheng. Ninety-one prisoners who usually had bad character and liked to cause trouble were concentrated in the "He Prison" for strict supervision and to promote self-reflection. It is reported that Prison Warden Kong Xianglin will return to Shanghai today. Guard Section Chief Ding has prepared a report on the handling of the incident and has requested punishment. The original text is roughly as follows: "The kitchen workers had an altercation due to personal grudges. There were many workers serving in the kitchen, and this department did not hire boiler technicians. The replenishment of lunch boxes was not timely, and the order of meals was inevitably somewhat chaotic. At this time, the old and new administrations are transitioning, personnel are incomplete, and arrangements are not yet finalized, so all management cannot take decisive action. This difficult situation has long been observed by the leader.</p>
<p>The Cause</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 3rd), prisoner No. 180 and others expressed dissatisfaction with the behavior of prisoner No. 202, 419, and 651 (namely Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and Xu Zaichang) in the same workshop and requested the section chief to isolate them. Dozens of prisoners jointly requested this, and No. 202 and others also pointed out that the other party was forming cliques and excluding dissidents. Considering that the dispute was purely due to emotional conflict, I instructed them to submit evidence for verification and immediately ordered the isolation and detention of No. 202 and others because they had angered the public. Today (the 4th), I feared a conflict between the two parties and personally led the standby team to the kitchen to supervise the distribution of food and water and urged both parties to submit evidence to the section as soon as possible. According to guard chief Wang Xinzhun and Education Section Chief Jian Xiu, there were behind-the-scenes figures in this dispute, and they were clearing up the clues and conducting reconciliation.</p>
<p>At the Same Time</p>
<p>I realized that the prisoners on both sides were desperate outlaws, and the kitchen tools could be used as weapons at any time. I urgently locked the iron doors of the workshops in each cell at noon, collected the keys, added weapons to each guard, and summoned the standby guards outside to await dispatch. According to a secret report from guard chief Wang Xin, each side had nearly a thousand people assisting them. Regardless of whether this was true, it was necessary to take strict precautions. At 2:00 PM, Section Chief Wang and guard chief Wang were urging the two main parties to come to a result in reconciliation when No. 180 and others sent representatives to the section to make further demands, insisting that the prison authorities immediately transfer No. 202 and others away. The three prisoners under attack by the public, No. 202 and others, insisted that even if they were allowed to enter the kitchen again, they had to stay in the workshop for several days to save face. I silently observed that the two sides could not coordinate and ordered each to return to their original positions and ordered No. 180 and others to resume work as usual as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Meal Distribution</p>
<p>It was already after 3:00 PM. No. 202 and others encountered a kitchen worker delivering water on their way back to their cells and made rude remarks, resulting in a dispute with kitchen worker No. 3147 (namely Zhou Wenlong). At that time, in the inner prison courtyard facing the warden's office to the north, I suddenly saw prisoners pouring out of the kitchen, more than a dozen wielding weapons and more than a dozen unarmed. I immediately ordered them to put down their weapons and ordered the standby team to fire shots into the air as a warning. The prisoners were subdued and retreated. With the consent of the main department dispatched by the Shanghai High Court, this prison telegraphed the Shanghai District Court Detention Center and temporarily detained the three prisoners No. 202, 419, and 651. At the same time, the kitchen workers were ordered to resume work as usual and distribute the meals. Fortunately, the other prisoners were alerted early and there was no spread of the disturbance. This was the end of the incident."</p>
<h3>District Procuratorate Brings Main Culprits of Disturbance to Trial</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Procuratorate is scheduled to bring the main culprits of the Shanghai Prison disturbance, Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and Xu Zaichang, to trial this afternoon (currently detained at the Sinan Road Detention Center). Shi and others are being sued by another prisoner, Zhou Wenlong, on charges of "attempted murder." Shanghai Prison inmates Lu Jinshan, No. 1737, and Chun J, No. 3208, will be summoned to court as witnesses. According to people in the court, prisoners suing each other is a rare sight. This is a completely new type of lawsuit case.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Money Boxes Fall From the Sky; Miao People Make a Fortune; Xiang Province Exchanges Them at 20% Discount; Total Value of 48 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Hengyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 10th] The Central Bank of Chongqing previously entrusted the Air Transport Brigade to transport sixty boxes of 10,000-yuan banknotes to Chongqing on August 25th. Over the skies of Qian and Gui, due to mechanical failure, the money boxes were forced to be dropped in the Miao areas of Huangping and Shibing. The Qian Province government investigated and found their whereabouts at that time. Now, the new banknotes have all been picked up by the Miao people, with a total value of 48 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The Miao people initially did not recognize their value. Later, they took a bundle, worth 10 million yuan, to buy meat at a butcher shop. The butcher shop was greatly surprised. The Miao people were overjoyed and moved en masse to the towns to spend the money. Some bought and used them at a discount. Now they have spread throughout Hunan and Guizhou. Because of these lost banknotes, the Central Bank in Shaoyang has refused to accept them, causing the citizens to feel uneasy.</p>
<p>It is learned that the Central Bank branches in Hunan have received telegrams to exchange them at a 20% discount, and the serial numbers of the banknotes have been announced as new banknotes from 50 to 50.</p>
<h3>Wenling Rice Prices Increase Three or Four Times a Day</h3>
<p>[Wenling Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 7th] Rice prices have been soaring in recent days. Early rice has risen to 850,000 yuan per picul, late rice has risen to 900,000 yuan, and glutinous rice has risen to 1.2 million yuan. The supply is limited, and prices are still rising. This is the result of smuggling out to sea. All parties hope that the authorities will take strict precautions. In addition, merchants from neighboring counties such as Wanghuan and Chumen are greedy for high profits, raising market prices and buying up rice in this city to transport it out of the country to Da and Xiaoqing, often making several times the profit. Therefore, rice prices increase three or four times a day, and people are quite alarmed. If this continues, the rice supply will be depleted, and people's food security will be at risk.</p>
<h3>Pingyang Experiencing Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>[Pingyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 8th] Pingyang, traditionally known as a land of fish and rice, has recently been experiencing a major rice shortage, with grain prices higher than in other counties. Common people rely on rice vendors from various villages to transport and sell rice in the city. Once rice prices fluctuate, not a single grain can be seen. Mills in coastal areas such as Wanquan and Jiangnan have been milling rice secretly at night, with unscrupulous merchants lurking in the shadows, smuggling it out to sea. It has recently been learned that the local land and grain authorities have received reports that bandits are purchasing grain at high prices. They have issued a public notice and have sent police officers to the countryside to strictly investigate and prohibit this.</p>
<h3>Xikou to Establish Hydroelectric Plant; Ministry of Water Resources Approves Allocation of 200 Million Yuan for Materials</h3>
<p>[Hangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 9th] The Water Conservancy Demonstration Engineering Office of the Ministry of Water Resources previously sent the 291st Survey Team to survey the area around Xuebao Temple and Yintan in Xikou to design a hydroelectric plant. It is learned that this project has been surveyed and designed and is planned to build a dike in front of Xuebao Temple to create a reservoir. The original waterfall at Qianzhangyan will be preserved and controlled. Another channel will be controlled on the ridge of Dagongling Mountain to set up a hydroelectric plant. It is estimated that it can generate 1,000 horsepower, which can supply electricity to Ningbo. Once the ministry approves, construction can begin. It is said that the Ministry of Water Resources has agreed to allocate 200 million yuan for the required materials.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Method for Exempting Native Cloth from Business Tax</h3>
<p>[Jiangyin Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 6th] The local cloth industry association in this county submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption from business tax. Later, because the scope of the exemption differed from the ministry's approval, the provincial government issued an explanation that farmers who weave native cloth themselves and sell it directly to distributors should be exempt from business tax in accordance with the regulations on the native cloth manufacturing industry. If the above-mentioned native cloth is purchased and resold by cloth merchants, the cloth merchant's part is within the scope of the trading industry and should be taxed in accordance with the law. This does not conflict with the Ministry of Finance's regulations that all native cloth manufacturing industries, whether spun and woven by hand or woven in factories, are exempt from business tax, except for distributors. As for the association's submission that distributors who set up factories to recruit workers to weave and sell directly, the part they manufacture themselves should be exempt from business tax, and the part they sell from other factories should still be taxed in accordance with the regulations. In addition, if distributors provide looms to farmers to weave, and the distributors also provide cotton yarn and collect the native cloth, and the farmers only receive wages, then the distributors should be exempt from business tax because they are hiring but not weaving themselves. Otherwise, they should still be taxed in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3>Self-Defense Teams Must Not Leave Their Posts, Concentrating Personnel and Weapons at Any Time Awaiting County Government Dispatch</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 10th] The Wu County government has ordered the mobilization to eliminate the remnants of bandits roaming within the county. In addition to establishing a suppression command post in Guangfu Town, it has also issued a notice to all township people's self-defense teams that they must not leave their posts, concentrating personnel and weapons at any time, awaiting dispatch. Violators will be punished by military law.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Youth Enlist in the Army; Division Headquarters Orders Deferment</h3>
<p>[Zhenjiang Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 9th] The Southern Jiangsu Division Headquarters previously launched a youth enlistment campaign and allocated a total of 3,000 volunteers to the counties in Jiangnan. The headquarters has now telegraphed the counties under its jurisdiction to exempt this quota from reallocation.

<h3>General Relief Administration Zhejiang Branch Makes Last Gesture; Remaining 67 Bundles of Old Clothes Allocated to Zhejiang Provincial Journalists Association</h3>
<p>The General Relief Administration's Zhejiang branch is making a last gesture, specially allocating the remaining 67 bundles of relief old clothes distributed by the branch to the Zhejiang Provincial Journalists Association. Unfortunately, with more than 4,000 members throughout the province, there are only 2,000 pieces of old clothing, so there is not enough to go around, making distribution difficult.</p>
<p>The price of a life has already been fixed. A few days ago, at the entrance of Dongqing Alley, a thug kicked a coolie to death. The murderer is willing to subsidize the deceased's family with 4.5 million yuan in an attempt to settle the matter privately.</p>
<p>The fare per stop on city buses has increased from 600 yuan to 1,000 yuan. The reason given is "trouble with making change."</p>
<p>Jiang Qian Naming Bridge has suffered two major fires in succession, leaving thousands of disaster victims homeless. Provincial and municipal authorities, as well as enthusiastic gentry, have held emergency relief efforts, but they are a drop in the bucket and do not help.</p>
<p>Hangzhou has not yet implemented food conservation. The major restaurants are always full, and business is booming.</p>
<p>Various cinemas are launching their autumn lineups. "Golden Stone Covenant" and "Silver River Serenade" are being released one after another, selling very well. (Ding)</p>
<h3>Boatman Shot and Killed for Disobeying Orders; Sentry Detained and Investigated According to Law</h3>
<p>[Suzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper on the 10th] This evening, a boat was traveling from Changshu to Suzhou. When it passed the joint military, police, and gendarmerie traffic safety inspection station near Yangguan, the sentry at the station ordered it to dock for inspection.

Commander Peng was deeply saddened upon hearing the news. In addition to detaining the sentry and investigating him according to the law, he has also collected funds to comfort the deceased's family.</p>
<h3>Lanzhou Baiyi Nunnery: Dispute over Rent Leads to Nun's Suicide Attempt</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou dispatch of the 5th] A nun in Lanzhou City's Yimin Road Baiyi Nunnery, named Hengyi, over forty years old, lives with her five disciples. They rely on the rent from the nunnery's sixty-odd rooms for their livelihood. Last spring, a man claiming to be Wang Zhongying, the principal of Lanzhou Mountain Middle School, declared that the nunnery's property had been allocated to establish the Lanzhou Mountain Middle School by order of the provincial government. He then evicted all the residents renting rooms in the nunnery, occupying over forty-one rooms. At that time, Hengyi, the head of the nunnery, sued Wang in the Gaolan District Court. After mediation by the court, a lease agreement was signed in June under Wang Zhongying's name, with a monthly rent of 20,000 yuan for the forty-one rooms. Later, due to rising prices, Hengyi repeatedly pleaded with Principal Wang to increase the rent, which was only increased to 60,000 yuan this spring.</p>
<p>This summer, Wang Zhongying, under the pretext of expanding the school buildings, further seized the remaining twenty-two rooms of the nunnery, and stopped paying the meager 60,000 yuan monthly rent in July this year. (Reporter's Note: Currently, the monthly rent for each room in Lanzhou is 100,000 yuan, and it is several times higher for shops along the street.)</p>
<p>The abbess of the nunnery, Hengyi, found herself destitute and her livelihood in dire straits. On the afternoon of the 30th of last month, at 2:00 PM, she went to Wang's residence to demand the rent. Wang not only refused to pay but also threatened her and ordered Hengyi to vacate the three rooms where she and her five disciples were barely sheltering. Hengyi, unable to resist his menacing demeanor and finding her life in a desperate situation, saw a paper-cutting knife on Wang's desk and contemplated suicide. She grasped the knife and stabbed herself in the throat, causing a wound about three fen deep and two cun three fen long. She immediately fainted, with blood gushing out.</p>
<p>Her neighbors carried her to the Lanzhou City Health Office for treatment. Because the nun had no money for hospitalization, her disciples carried her back to the nunnery. Her life is currently not in danger, but she remains unconscious, and her livelihood is precarious, eliciting sympathy from all sides. It is reported that the Lanzhou District Court is investigating the case closely.</p>

<h3>Basketball League Leader: Leads All the Way. Chen You Cup Group A: Hualian Defeats Green Forest.</h3>
<p>The Youth Association's Chen You Cup basketball tournament was held as usual yesterday afternoon from 5:30 PM, with four games in Groups A and B, still at the association's gymnasium in Baxianqiao. The results of the competition are as follows: In the first game, the Jianle team of the B You Department played against Sanyi. Due to the disparity in strength, Jianle easily defeated Sanyi with a score of 35 to 16. In the second game, the Nanle team and the Changlu team of the B Cup Department competed. Both teams were evenly matched, so the battle was quite close, and the situation fluctuated. As a result, Nanle narrowly defeated Changlu with a score of 18 to 16.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM, the Group A games began. Chen Youyi and Gengsheng took the stage first. Under evenly matched strength, the battle was extremely fierce. At the end of the first half, Gengsheng took the lead with a score of 24 to 21, only three points ahead. After the break, Gengsheng became more and more courageous, while Changle lacked experience and was somewhat flustered, so they were attacked by Gengsheng. When the time was up, Gengsheng defeated Changyou basketball with a score of 46 to 32. In the following game, the league leader Hualian played against the Green Forest youngsters. Hualian's victory was expected, so after the two sides made contact, Hualian led all the way, ending the first half with a score of 25 to 12. After the break, although Green Forest launched a fierce counterattack, they failed to succeed due to a single bad move, and the situation remained behind. When the game ended, Hualian defeated Green Forest with a score of 49 to 29 without much effort. The results of each game last night are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jianle defeated Sanyi (B You) 35-16 Gengsheng defeated Changlan (Group A) 46-32</p>

<h3>Six District Cotton Textile Association Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation Issue, Textile Federation Subcommittee Presents Eight Concrete Suggestions</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Six District Cotton Textile Association held an emergency general meeting of members at 2:00 PM yesterday to address the issue of joint cotton yarn allocation. Over a hundred representatives attended. Rong Erren, representative of the Textile Federation attending the National Economic Commission in Nanjing, first reported on the situation. Then, the chairman presented the Ministry of Economic Affairs' draft plan for joint cotton yarn sales, immediately raising tensions across the room. All agreed that since the authorities still did not consider the difficulties raised by privately-owned yarn mills, it would be impossible to proceed. The Textile Federation Subcommittee's opinions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Under the guidance and supervision of the Textile Adjustment Committee, the Six District Cotton Textile Association will establish a Joint Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee to handle cotton yarn allocation matters. The specific measures will be determined separately. The cotton yarn controlled by the Allocation Committee will include all production from private member factories of the Six District Association in Shanghai, as well as cotton yarn spun on behalf of all private member factories of the Six District Association, for joint allocation. The price of cotton yarn allocation should be absolutely reasonable. The Allocation Committee should ensure the cost of reproduction, using a fixed formula with physical goods as the calculation basis, and determine it at any time. However, the profit should not exceed 15% in principle. If various factories participate in the allocation, and their working capital cannot be adjusted in time, the government is responsible for approving loans sufficient to cover the turnover of funds. The government should allow various factories to purchase national cotton, relax the amount of exchange margin allowed, and extend the exchange margin period to achieve the purpose of enriching raw cotton. The government should allow various factories to transport and sell 20% of their total production overseas, to exchange for foreign cotton and industrial raw materials, etc., and receive the same treatment as state-owned yarn mills. After the Allocation Committee is established, it should first handle the investigation, registration, and approval of cotton yarn allocation targets. As soon as it is completed, it will be implemented. The allocation method will be tentatively limited to six months.</p>
<p>Yarn Merchant Representatives Petition in Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Yarn Business Association held a meeting of directors and supervisors to address the issue of joint allocation. They believe that yarn merchants have the responsibility of regulating the replica industry and rural side businesses throughout the country and should have their status affirmed. It was decided to petition in Nanjing. Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Association, and nine others took the night express to Nanjing last night. Some representatives are scheduled to fly on a China National Aviation Corporation plane this morning. The petition targets are tentatively set at the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant ministries and commissions.</p>

Japonica rice rose slightly by 10,000 yuan, while indica rice, due to insufficient production area ratios, rose another 20,000 yuan. The mainland mainly shipped japonica rice. Flour was sporadically quoted higher, rising by 35,000 yuan per step, but then turned down at the close. Wheat skin sales were not strong, and factories continued to supply it, with a slight increase of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

<h3>Frequent Negative News: Chinese Stocks Show Weakness Again</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks yesterday fell in response to news reports, disappointing buyers. Cantonese traders continued to buy in the middle of the session, but the short sellers at 300 yuan tried their best to suppress the market, making it impossible to advance further, and the market closed in a weak state. Miscellaneous stocks, on the other hand, showed mixed performance. At the beginning of the session, due to reports of a US loan of 1 billion and Xu Cai's remarks on the reduction of deposit certificate fees, which indicated that it had not been mentioned, the current delivery price retreated to 297 yuan after opening at 303 yuan. Although the interest rate in the over-the-counter market opened at 1 jiao 3 fen and 1 jiao 8 fen above par, it still gradually fell to 293 yuan and 295 yuan. Later, as Wuhe and Xinya successively hit the limit up, there was a rebound, but the over-the-counter short sellers launched a head-on attack, and Cement also hit the limit down. In the midst of great struggle near noon, the market was forced down to a closing price of 291 yuan for current delivery and a low price of 294 yuan for deferred delivery. Only Tongyi was maintained from the 4th, closing at a high price of 75 yuan. Popular stock Taiyuan closed at a low price. As a result, compared to Saturday's current delivery shares, Xinya rose to the limit and rebounded, rising by 10%, Wuhe rose to the limit, Zhongni fell to the limit, and Yongsha, Xinhe, Meiya, Zhongsi, Huafeng, Huaxin, Rongfeng, Xinguang, Yonggong, and Zhongfa each fell by half a percent, while the rest fell slightly. For deferred delivery shares, Yongsha, Meiya, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing fell by half a percent, while Xinhe fell slightly.</p>
<p>In the after-market, the current delivery price retreated again to 292 yuan, and the deferred delivery price was 291 yuan, showing an inverted structure. Cantonese traders came in to buy, and it was heard that the Central Bank's clearing balance was a net outflow of more than 70 billion, so the price rebounded to 298 yuan. Sellers continued to pour in, and the Central Bank's clearing balance was again a net inflow, so the price fell again to around 293 yuan. The closing prices were 295 yuan and 296 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous session's current delivery shares, Neiyi, Zhongsi, and Xinyi fell slightly, while Zhabei Rongji, Huafeng, Jingfu, Lian, and Shangping were flat, and the rest rose slightly. For deferred delivery shares, Meiya and Jingfu fell slightly, while the rest rose slightly. In the over-the-counter market, except for public utilities stocks, which fell slightly, cultural stocks were flat, and bank stocks continued to be popular.</p>
<p>Hengfeng Increases Capital: Hengfeng Yarn Factory</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Rebound, Foreign Stocks Stable</h3>
<p>Government bonds rose yesterday due to abundant credit. Miscellaneous brands were absorbed by rooms 360 and 550, making them stronger. The Unified C Bond opened at 22,000 yuan in the morning, rising to as high as 24,200 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. Rooms 503 and 552 supplied, while rooms 555 and 528 bought in. As a result, compared to Saturday of last week, A and B bonds rose by 1,700, C bonds rose by 1,900, D bonds rose by 1,800, and E bonds also improved by 2,000 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 6 million yuan.</p>

Jardine Textiles opened at 205,500 yuan in the morning, with the high price not exceeding 211,000 yuan, and the low price also stopping at 205,000 yuan, before stabilizing slightly.

<h3>Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Adjusted Again: 20-Count Yarn Increased by Over 1 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) The Textile Adjustment Committee's Negotiated Price Subcommittee decided yesterday to slightly adjust the negotiated price of 20-count cotton yarn, increasing it to 21 million yuan per piece, an increase of 1.15 million yuan compared to the previous time. The prices of other yarn counts will be adjusted in proportion.</p>
<p>Fine Yarn Declines</p>
<p>In yesterday's cotton yarn market, although the opening of the negotiated price by the Textile Adjustment Committee was higher, the market sentiment was weak due to unfavorable environmental factors, and many bulls turned to sell, causing the market to decline instead. Near the close, dye weaving factories and buyers from other places absorbed the price declines, and the market rebounded again. In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 300,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 36.2 million yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix also fell by 300,000 yuan, while other coarse yarns such as 32-count and 20-count rose by 150,000 to 350,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Turns Upward</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, prices were low at the opening due to the eagerness to sell off accumulated positions from the previous day, but after 10 o'clock, buyers from Changsha, Hankou, Fujian, and other places absorbed Yuanzhi Gongni, and local dye factories bought mid-range fine cloth, causing the market to turn upward. As a result, fine cloths of various grades, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, continued to rise by 4,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to Saturday, Sijunzi Gongni rose sharply by 55,000 yuan, and the prices of other cloth remnants were also quite firm.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's raw cotton market continued to be firm. Buyers from other ports actively added to their positions, and local traders also increased their holdings. Prices were still slightly higher than on Saturday by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Transactions amounted to around 1,400 bales of various grades. Factory delivery prices were 4 million yuan for Kaiping, 3.75 million yuan for Chongchuan, and warehouse delivery prices were 3.96 million yuan for Kaiping, 3.596 million yuan for Hanxi, 3.7 million yuan for Shashi, 3.1 million yuan for Fude, 2.645 million yuan for Yaohua, 2.9 million yuan for Fire Machine, and 670,000 yuan for Zhouji Hua.</p>
<p>Procedures for Shipping Yarn and Cloth to South China Changed</p>
<p>The Textile Adjustment Committee urgently needs to process applications for shipping yarn and cloth to South China this month. The process starts on the 11th. The total amount of yarn and cloth approved for shipment to South China, combined with the remaining amount from last month, is approximately 5,000 pieces of yarn and over 140,000 zhang of cloth. To prevent applicants from overreporting and under-shipping, or transferring their allocations, the committee has slightly improved the application procedures for this month. Previously, the applicant would directly fill out the form, stamp it, and apply. Now, the applicant must obtain a blank application form, fill it out, and submit the application to the producing factory for stamping. The stamping factory will then submit the applicant's application to the Textile Adjustment Committee on their behalf. This will eliminate the problems with traders.</p>
<h3>International Market Has Many Obstacles: Export Trade Is Difficult to Develop: Domestic Goods Manufacturers Should Implement Joint Promotion</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) Our country's recent export trade has entered a downturn again. In addition to the reason that the listed exchange rate and the black market rate cannot be consistent, there are still inherent difficulties in each sales market. Taking the United States as an example, raw silk was originally an important export, but recently, the United States imported a large amount of Japanese silk, and the stock piled up, the demand decreased, and the market price fell, affecting the sales of Chinese silk. Due to international competition, not much Chinese tea is exported. The sales of pig bristles are still good, mainly due to the lack of competition, and the quality of the substitute nylon is still not comparable to that of natural bristles. However, it has recently been reported that Germany has invented a machine for sorting pig bristles. If this is true, it will be a major blow to us. In Europe, the United Kingdom is a larger customer, and its need for food is very urgent. Our country cannot supply general grains. Only the Central Trust Bureau trades with the British Ministry of Food, exporting a large number of eggs. Recently, several egg factories in our city intend to export eggs and their products to the United Kingdom. The Industrial and Commercial Export Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has introduced them to the distribution officials of the British Ministry of Food to establish close contact, so as to clarify the types they need and be able to prepare in advance. As for the European continent, the outlook is not good, because after the great war, the wounds have not healed, the purchasing power is very low, and the main countries still maintain the wartime rationing system, so the quantity of foreign goods needed is not large. India and Southeast Asia are promising markets, but it is also premised on domestic goods manufacturers being able to abandon individual competition and implement joint promotion. Currently, there is a good trend in this direction.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Cooperation to Prevent Smuggling: Ships Sailing from Hong Kong to Chinese Ports Must Submit a Hatch List Verified by the Hong Kong Government</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Shipping News: Our customs authorities are now taking stricter measures to prevent smuggling. From the 15th of this month, ships sailing from Hong Kong to ports in our country shall, upon arrival, submit to the local customs a copy of the hatch list of the goods loaded in Hong Kong to that place. The hatch list should first be certified by the Hong Kong government before it becomes effective. Any goods not included in the hatch list will be treated as smuggled goods. This measure has now been cooperated with by the Sino-British authorities to eliminate smuggling. The Hong Kong Government Information Office stated that the Chinese government had difficulty with the hatch list for goods imported into China from Hong Kong and believed that some goods sent to various ports in China from Hong Kong with a Hong Kong hatch list were unloaded midway and smuggled into China. As a result, the hatch list submitted when the ship arrived at a Chinese port was not consistent with the hatch list compiled and submitted to the Hong Kong government. The Chinese government has now invited the Hong Kong authorities to cooperate in finding ways to prevent such behavior. Therefore, from November 15, each ship arriving at a Chinese port carrying goods unloaded from Hong Kong must have a hatch list stamped by the responsible authority of the Hong Kong government and submit it to the local Chinese customs for inspection. To comply with the above regulations of the Chinese customs, shippers can obtain a departure certificate from the Hong Kong Marine Department and submit it together with the hatch list of goods unloaded from Hong Kong. If there are no goods unloaded from Hong Kong, a hatch list of "no goods unloaded from Hong Kong" must also be submitted. The hatch list should be in duplicate, and the Marine Department will stamp it when issuing the departure certificate. One copy will be returned to the shipper or its agent. The second copy will be sent to Hong Kong Customs. This second hatch list can be used as the hatch list deposited with Hong Kong Customs in accordance with Article 15 of the Import and Export Goods Registration Regulations of 1922. This method facilitates the loading and unloading of goods by shippers until they are ready to depart and avoids running between the two government agencies. One is to obtain the departure certificate, and the other is to submit a copy of the hatch list. The above method refers to ships traveling from Hong Kong to Chinese ports, carrying goods unloaded from Hong Kong, and carrying them to Chinese ports. Goods carried on the same ship from other places to China, passing through Hong Kong, or returning to Hong Kong for unloading and transporting to a certain port outside of China, are not subject to this rule.</p>
<h3>Rayon Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>The rayon market was slightly firm yesterday. There were immediate transactions for 120-count Asahi brand 1A bright rayon at 86.5 million yuan in the morning. Later, due to the distribution by the Central Trust Bureau, a new inspection was required, and it was said that there may be a temporary suspension this week, so the market sentiment was relatively firm in the afternoon. There were transactions among traders at 77.5 million yuan, and finally someone wanted it at 80 million yuan. As a result, it was 2 million yuan higher than the weekend.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Registration of Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Extended to November 18</h3>
<p>(Our Dispatch) The Import and Export Management Committee has announced that the deadline for completing the retroactive registration of types of goods with self-provided foreign exchange and no permits has been extended to November 18.</p>
<h3>"Pre-Announcement" Permits Allowed to be Extended to the End of This Year</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Import and Export Management Committee issued a public notice yesterday stipulating that for various types of goods listed in Appendices A and B, the validity period of the "pre-announcement" import permits that have been issued, if the validity period is not specified, shall be uniformly extended to December 31 of this year. For "pre-announcement" import permits listed in Appendix A (B), the validity period shall uniformly expire on July 31 of this year. If the import declarations for all of the above-mentioned types of goods have been completed within the specified validity period, the "pre-announcement" import permits shall be invalid. Regarding the matters related to the above-mentioned "pre-announcement" import permits, as well as the application for replacing "pre-announcement" import permits for Appendix A type goods with "post-announcement" import permits, inquiries should be made to the Non-Quota Import Review Department of the Import and Export Management Committee.</p>
<h3>Export Management Committee Encourages Export Goods: Special Import Permit for Packaging Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In order to encourage exports, the Export and Import Management Committee has specially permitted the import of packaging materials needed for shipping export goods, and has notified exporters to register at Room 321, 3rd Floor, China Bank Building, Renji Road, from the 12th to the 27th of this month for review. At the same time, it announced the "Methods for Special Permits for the Import of Packaging Materials Needed by Exporters for Shipping Export Goods":</p>
<p>Exporters may, for the packaging materials needed for their export business, import them with a special import permit outside the quota for these goods. However, exporters who have already received this preferential treatment shall not be entitled to this special permit again within the normal import quota for packaging materials. The import permit shall be issued by the Export and Import Management Committee.</p>
<p>If exporters wish to enjoy this preferential treatment, they should apply to the Export Promotion Department of the Export and Import Management Committee. The application shall include the following items: A. Detailed list of imported packaging materials; B. Estimated quantity and value of the materials needed, and the goods and quantities to be packaged; C. The port where the materials will be used.</p>
<p>The Export Promotion Department shall, before issuing this special import permit, carefully examine the exporter's application in accordance with the listed items. It must also be ascertained that the total quantity of all materials specially permitted for import does not exceed the proper total amount needed by China for the whole year. If the Export Promotion Department believes, when examining any application, that the quantity requested exceeds the actual need, it may make appropriate reductions.</p>
<p>Exporters shall provide a guarantee that they will not sell the materials imported with this special permit in the market without the written approval of the Export Promotion Department. Exporters who have imported packaging materials under the preferential treatment shall submit a statement to the Export Promotion Department at the end of every three months. The statement shall detail the quantity of materials used to package export goods. If the exporter's inventory exceeds the amount needed for future exports, the Export Promotion Department may, according to its regulations, transfer and sell the remaining portion to an exporter who needs these materials.</p>
<p>The Export Promotion Department shall have the right to audit the statements submitted by exporters.</p>
<p>In view of the importance of the economic handling and transportation of cotton to various industrial areas in China, the foregoing measures shall also apply to the packaging of cotton for domestic sales.</p>

<p>Special Edition Celebrating the First Industry Festival</p>
<h3>Celebrating the First Industrial Festival</h3>
<p>— Wu Yun Chu</p>
<p>If a nation possesses fertile land, yet its people lack sufficient food, it is because plowing tools are scarce and incomplete, preventing the exchange of labor between morning and evening, thus hindering the hope of a bountiful harvest. If a land possesses abundant resources, yet its people lack sufficient wealth, it is because the quantity of [resources] has not been unlocked, causing idle investigations to permeate markets, obscuring the benefits of development. If markets have stagnant goods, yet the people lack sufficient materials for use, it is because transportation equipment is inadequate, preventing abundant goods from being mutually exchanged, hindering the effectiveness of equitable distribution. From this, it can be seen that when industry prospers, agriculture increases its yield, commerce increases its profit, the people become wealthy internally, and the nation becomes strong externally. Therefore, the waxing and waning of industry are proportional to the strength of the nation, and the poverty and wealth of the people are closely linked. From this, we know that the wealth and strength of others are not accidental, and our poverty and weakness are not coincidental. It is worthy of our deep and prolonged reflection. If we do not plan to build industry to aid development, allowing the land to fully realize its potential, yet seek the wealth and expansion of the nation, and the abundance of the people, what is the use of [expecting] granaries to alleviate hunger, [expecting to] gorge oneself behind closed doors, of facing carved tigers and dragons, inviting wind and summoning rain, and expecting wind and clouds to bring [benefits]? If we merely rely on imported goods for supplementation, without considering the outflow of profits, which is the main cause of the weakness of the nation and the poverty of the people, can we take from external treasuries endlessly to supply extravagant consumption? If rivers cannot [flow] continuously, and mountains and seas cannot look to streams, ancient teachings provide ample warning. Moreover, the consumption is far greater than leakage, and the expected benefits are even more different than small streams! Now, Heaven has not yet tired of chaos, and the nation is still engaged in war. The signal fires are ever more urgent, and there is no hope for development. Production frequently shrinks, and factories face the danger of collapse. What the heart perceives as danger, how can we remain silent? Therefore, at this time of joyful celebration, I once again voice urgent appeals, so that people in society can jointly recognize the importance of industrial construction, rise up together to support it, guide idle capital, bring it onto the right track for the benefit of the people, increase production, provide sufficient goods to build the foundation of the nation. Otherwise, even if we know that fertile soil is suitable for good fields, and straight trees are suitable for beams and pillars, if we do not cultivate them to sow good crops, or fell them to construct beams, how can we solve the lack of grain, or alleviate [poor] housing? All of us engaged in industry should strive diligently from dawn to dusk, not failing the expectations of the government above, and considering the suffering of the people below, holding firm to our resolve with prudence, navigating through the autumn of wind and rain, awaiting the time when [the Xiongnu ruler's] leather belt turns [denoting peace], and the majestic passes disperse the valiant troops, when the Peach Forest disbands its armor, and the armory [stores away] yellow bird flags. When people harbor the resolve to unleash [a hurricane], and the nation achieves great prosperity, then the goods of all industries will be abundant, and the benefits of all the land will be secured. Looking back on the hardships of today, we will then recognize the true flavor of success. As we celebrate the First Industrial Festival, I offer [this humble writing] and wish to encourage all those in the national industrial community!</p>
<h3>From Celebrating the Industrial Festival to Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Hu Bo Xiang</p>
<p>Today is the first anniversary in Chinese history. The significance is self-evident. Our country was originally based on agriculture, regarding industry as a secondary occupation. In addition, since the establishment of the Republic of China, wars have been frequent. Although knowledgeable people in the country have advocated for industry, they have been unable to fulfill the desire to build the country through industry, due to strong neighbors surrounding us. After the eight-year war of resistance, although industry suffered severe destruction, victory belonged to us, so the whole country has deeply recognized the importance of industrial construction. This is something that fellow industrial colleagues should celebrate.</p>
<p>The decline of industry is related to national power, which is already known to everyone. Before the War of Resistance, European and American countries, along with our eastern neighbors, used their superior industrial equipment to regard our country as the end of [the line] for disposing of surplus goods, forcing domestic factories to be unable to compete with them, resulting in long-term trade deficits, which caused the main cause of national weakness and poverty. Therefore, the most important factor in developing industry is to promote national goods, so that people are aware of the use of national goods. If the production of factories is bound to increase, the increase in production will reduce costs and the sales price will naturally be low. Factories will thrive as a result. Industry will gradually develop, profits will not flow outward, the nation will become strong, and the people will be rich. Therefore, people with knowledge have risen up and encouraged people to develop the habit of using domestic products.</p>
<p>I feel this is important! In times of peace, we receive [goods] from abroad without paying attention to [the consequences]. If a war breaks out and traffic is cut off, we will suddenly find ourselves helpless. If we do not rely on foreign goods in peacetime, we can be self-sufficient even in the event of sudden changes. Why should we be embarrassed and [expose] our [weakness]? Therefore, on the anniversary of the Industrial Festival, I reiterate the importance of promoting national goods to inform the people of the country, as an old man should speak up and take action to cultivate the foundation of industry. I also hope that people engaged in industry will pay close attention to the improvement of technology and the improvement of materials, so that people will be happy to adopt them and dispel the mentality of worshipping foreign goods. I hope that the industrial community will encourage each other.</p>

<p>China has always been an agricultural country, paying little attention to industrial construction, ignoring the importance of "industry" in achieving wealth and power, and in building the nation. This has led to national weakness and poverty, making it impossible to be self-sufficient. During the War of Resistance, our fragile and immature industry was almost completely destroyed. Since the victory, observing the trends of the world and examining the current state of the country, we know that it is difficult to compete with other countries if we do not strive for industrial construction and strengthen our economic power. Switzerland, a small country, has 44% of its people engaged in industry. Molotov, in his speech commemorating the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, said: "Although devastated by the war, the Soviet Union's industrial production has recovered to pre-war levels" (see Moscow broadcast on the 7th). MacArthur is helping Japan in every way to restore its industrial level to the level of 1934. Looking back at the industrial production situation in our country after the victory, I don't need to say more. Everyone must have felt that the future is very bleak. The ancients said: "Hardships revitalize the nation." As long as we wake up early and strive to become stronger, how can we improve the equipment and increase the production of existing factories? Those who have not yet set up factories and have the financial resources should quickly invest in industry, study industry, and devote their lives to industry to revive China's economic construction as their own responsibility, serve the country, contribute to the country, and strive for the country's strength and glory. At the same time, I hope that the workers will uphold the principle that "there is work only when there is a factory," and work together through thick and thin, coordinate labor and capital, strive to increase work efficiency, and continue to produce, so that there is no idling for even a minute or a second, resulting in intermittent production, which threatens the country's economic lifeline. Today, when most of the people in the world are struggling on the hunger line, and most Chinese people are trapped in the tragic cruelty of war and the painful abyss of currency inflation, the only way to save social life from suffering is to do our best to restore the pre-war level of industrial production and actively develop new industrial construction in order to survive in the world. I am delighted to celebrate China's first Industrial Festival. I offer my warm expectations and hope to encourage my colleagues in the industrial community.</p>
<h3>Interpreting the Meaning of "Industrial Festival"</h3>
<p>— Gong</p>
<p>A name that can be passed down through the ages, spreading from mouth to mouth, must have a high meaning and deep connotation. However, if it is learned but not examined, it will eventually become obscure. Therefore, on the occasion of the celebration, the meaning of designating November 11 as Industrial Festival will be explained in detail: Tracing back to the period of the Anti-Japanese War, this association assisted the government in devoting itself to industrial construction. Although the equipment was simple and resources were scarce, it was still able to supply military needs above and civilian use below. Then, after the Yi chieftain surrendered, this association returned east and convened the First National Congress in the capital from November 9 to 11, 35th year of the Republic of China. It was generally believed that China's industry had always been backward. It was not until the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War that the importance of industrial construction was felt. The Chinese Industrial Association was thus established, laying the foundation for China's new industry. Its significance is extremely important. Therefore, the Executive Yuan approved the designation of November 11 as "Chinese Industrial Festival" for commemoration and encouragement. This is the origin of the Industrial Festival's designation and the selection of November.</p>
<p>The date of the congress was chosen on the 11th for three reasons. Examining the past and present, the double date of the month is a good festival. Starting from January 1, February 2 is the Flower Festival, March 3 is the Shangsi Festival, April 4 is Children's Day, May 5 is the Dragon Boat Festival, July 7 is the Qiqiao Festival, August 8 is Father's Day, September 9 is the Chongyang Festival, and October 10 is National Day. Although there are differences between yin and yang, there are no differences between ancient and modern sentiments. In addition, the date of completion of the congress coincided with the double date of the month, using the combined strength to plan universal development. Although it was the founding date of this association, it was actually the beginning of the new industrial construction. The meaning is very deep, so this date was chosen as the festival, not only for commemoration but also to wake up sight and hearing. This is the origin of the selection of the 11th for Industrial Festival.</p>
<p>Not only that, ten is the end of the number, and one is the beginning of the number, circulating and turning, with endless breath. Therefore, prosperity is followed by decline, and the extreme of decline is followed by restoration. The two characters of eleven contain the meaning of the extreme of decay followed by restoration. Tracing back to our country's industry, it originated very early. At that time, the folk customs were simple and honest. Huan Kuan said that industry is for the preparation of machinery. By the end of the Zhou dynasty, industry suddenly flourished. Guanzi said: "The cinnabar paint and Mao Yu of Longshu, the leather bones and ivory of Jingyang, and the Nanzi bamboo arrows of Jiangnan are waiting for work to be completed." Moreover, Mozi and Luban were born (carpenters still worship Ban as their ancestor), which made the industry revive. The records in Mozi can still be reviewed. The chapters on preparing ladders, preparing breakthroughs, and preparing holes can be regarded as the rise of machinery. Moreover, his 300 disciples mourned that our country has always looked down on industry, and no one succeeded him. Therefore, the Mo school declined, so that our country's industry has made no progress for more than 20 years, which can be said to be the extreme of decay. Now, although industry has been destroyed by the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, it can still continue to thrive, laying the foundation for perseverance and unyielding. Looking forward to the future, it contains endless hope. Moreover, the Industrial Association Law has been officially promulgated by the government, so that the Industrial Association has the status of a legal entity. This is the meaning of the Industrial Festival being designated on November 11.</p>
<p>Before the celebration congress, the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Association telegraphed to inquire about the meaning of the Industrial Festival being designated on November 11. Although it was replied by telegram, the text was simple and brief, and it was not clear. I know that there are more than one province and one association with doubts. Therefore, taking advantage of the celebration, I wrote an article to explain, so that those engaged in industry can understand its meaning in detail without being confused. Then, my words may not be superfluous!</p>
<h3>The Tasks That Should Be Done to Celebrate Industrial Festival</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Zhi Huan</p>
<p>Since the end of World War II, most countries in the world, with the exception of a few, have generally experienced unrest. This phenomenon continues to exist and expand. The same is true in our country, so people from all walks of life feel that the future is full of difficulties. In particular, the industrial community, due to the lack of raw materials, has made various industries show a state of paralysis. It is also impossible to start improving it. However, due to the general trend of the world, we do not need to be pessimistic. We must open a way out in this difficult environment!</p>
<p>Our country's industry is still backward, and all the equipment and scale are relatively simple, but in the current environment, it is an opportunity to catch up quickly and make progress toward the future. This opportunity should be well used by our industrial community. Regarding the future of our country's industry, we do not hope to have large-scale factories like the United States. As long as we promote healthy small and medium-sized factories, the reason is that we do not have enough financial resources, the lack of industrial and technical talents, and the difficulty of managing large-scale factories with concentrated workers, so it is not suitable to build larger factories. If we can really achieve the plan of promoting healthy small and medium-sized factories, we can already make our industry enter the right track and gradually promote it.</p>
<p>Today is the first Industrial Festival. It is a great anniversary for those engaged in industry in our country since the beginning of history. On this anniversary, we who are engaged in industry should be vigilant, make a general review of the past, and have a big plan for the future. It can also make the people of the country understand the significance of the country's need for industrial development. If every industrial worker can review the past and plan for the future every year today, the development of our country's industry will definitely have a bright future, and it is also hoped that in the future, there will be a grand industrial exhibition every year on this anniversary to show the efforts and progress of the industrial community.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Industrial Festival</h3>
<p>— Yin Zhi Zhong</p>
<p>At the current stage of deepening industrial crisis, we suddenly encounter the first Industrial Festival today. We are both filled with infinite emotion and pinned with endless hope. But what I am emotional about is not our industrial backwardness, but only our industrial setbacks. Because Chinese science has not been developed, since the opening of the sea ban, it has been poisoned by the corrupt politics of the Qing Dynasty, which has caused the country to remain in the feudal agricultural village for a long time, so it has hindered the opportunity to accept science. It was not until the last four or five decades that from handicraft to hand-mixed industry, and gradually to some machine-made manufacturing industry, so industrial backwardness is due to congenital defects and cannot be forced. If the government could understand the importance of industry to the country after the success of the first National Revolution, and rush to catch up, build factories, develop raw materials, and cultivate technical talents, using our vast manpower and relatively cheap wages to compete with other countries, the hope is still very high, and the effect is still very fast. Industrial backwardness is not the main factor that restricts industry.</p>
<p>If we want to talk about the world's advanced industrial countries, of course, we must recommend the UK as the leader, especially the development of the textile industry, which makes people beyond reach. However, Germany, Japan, the United States, France, and other countries are more advanced than China, but they are far behind the United Kingdom. However, because of the government's promotion and the people's construction, various light and heavy industries are progressing simultaneously. They are not reduced because of the industrial backwardness of the United Kingdom. On the contrary, many industries have come from behind. Before the Second World War, they were allied and parallel with the UK in industry and dominated the world. Among them, Japan's development of industry was also after the Meiji Restoration. The era of China is not long, but its productivity is enough to make Europe and the United States look sideways, and China is shocked. It is not reduced because of backwardness. If China also works hard to build like Germany and other countries, with China's large population and strong production and consumption power, why would it be inferior to the UK, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other countries, and actually abandon itself and wander in the tragic situation of "agricultural China." This source of disease is lurking because it cannot cultivate industry, but instead mourns the loss of industry. So I said that the underdevelopment of Chinese industry is not in the backwardness of industry, but in the setbacks it has suffered.</p>
<p>The setbacks of Chinese industry are indeed related to the internal and external troubles and wars in the past years, and the government's failure to guide and promote it is still the biggest reason. First, the government cannot protect industry, the customs allow unlimited imports of foreign goods, and foreigners have special rights to reside in China, such as using concessions to set up factories, using extraterritorial rights to enslave labor, and using strong funds to monopolize domestic raw materials, collude with Chinese officials, and force the struggle of small factories. These are all major setbacks suffered by Chinese industry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese government has not recognized the importance and independence of Chinese industry. It has always regarded industrial organizations as appendages of commercial organizations. It seems that industrial products are to be sold for money, so they are commodities and should belong to the scope of commerce, but it has forgotten its independent production!</p>
<p>But after the continuous struggle of the industrial community, the government has been able to change its plans suddenly and has recognized that the industrial community should have a transcendent and independent organization, and has officially promulgated the industrial regulations not long ago. This bright measure of the government is worthy of our congratulations, and now the responsible personnel of the government and the people in the industry also often discuss and are able to humbly accept the various industrial requirements. Compared with the past, there has indeed been a big difference! From now on, the industrial group is a healthy and legal institution. It can shoulder the responsibility of developing industry and building industry, and can eliminate the setbacks it has suffered in the unified cooperation of the country.</p>

<h3>Review of the Second Woodcut Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Liang Fu</p>
<p>The emerging woodcut has been nurtured by the War of Resistance and developed to the present stage. It has indeed grown stronger. Most of the artists' interests tend to "large-scale" and "color" creations. This time, there are very few "small pieces" exhibited. The largest ones are two or three feet long, and the most color versions are five or six colors. Compared with the local wood exhibitions during the War of Resistance, it is incomparable. Regarding the composition and skills of large-scale and color versions, generally speaking, they are all very good, but after a strict review, some are indeed worthy of our appreciation, and some are also worthy of criticism.</p>
<p>In terms of success, the color versions include Ren Lu's "Mourning", A Yang's "Spring Festival", Di Zhi's "Difficult Lunch", and Ke Ping's "Hard Work Vision", etc., which all show a high degree of aesthetic feeling in terms of composition, color, knife technique, and printing skills. Although some people at the meeting criticized Di Zhi's painting for not using a light yellow background and should use other sad colors as the background, I don't think so, because it is the happiest thing in the world for the children to get lunch, then the light yellow atmosphere shows relaxation and joy, which is just right. We should appreciate and praise the painters' hard work in these places. Secondly, talking about monochrome versions, in my opinion, the works of Xi Ya, Yong Yu, and Zi Yi are the best. Xi's "City Story", "Autumn Suburbs", "Stroll", "Persuade", Yong Yu's "Miao Dance", "Bath", "Tell Stories", "Pick Wheat Ears". Zi Yi's "Rest" and other works, in addition to having a strong poetic interest, can also express the essence of ancient Chinese woodcut skills in the engraved lines. I think these masterpieces of theirs can be regarded as the representative works of this whole wood exhibition. Although there are also excellent works by Li Qun, Ye Fu, Liu Lun, and Zhu Minggang, their composition and knife skills are still inseparable from the style of Soviet woodcuts. Although Minggang does not have much of a Soviet style, but every "line" is too unified and lacks variety, which makes people have no new feeling. This is also a shortcoming.</p>
<p>In terms of shortcomings, we feel that the works of Aigan account for as many as 20 or 30 pieces in this exhibition. Among these 20 or 30 pieces, only one color version is quite successful, and the rest are relatively rough, such as "Taiwan Coal Yard", "In the Carriage", "Kaohsiung Field", "Waiting for Crossing", etc., and the composition is not very accurate. Furthermore, such as Ke Tian's paintings, the length is so large, but the scene is so empty, it is better to select two or three featured works to show, which can give people a good impression.</p>
<p>In addition, several famous woodcut artists, such as Huang Yan, He Heng, Ye Fei, and Sha Yue, did not have works in this whole wood exhibition, which is also very inferior.</p>
<h3>Excerpt of Inscriptions on Hu Yaguang's Portraits</h3>
<p>Like Lu Danlin's, Da Qian adds scenery, Xia Jing Di</p>
<p>When the wonderful pen stops and portrays, it can imitate Lu's beautiful posture; Wu costumes show Zhang's hands even more, and the simple Yue cloth garment is very similar.</p>
<p>Again, Yang Tian Ji</p>
<p>Danlin on paper calls to life, Yaguang's portrait pen can do it; Autumn mountains are full of red, but there is autumn heart that has not been written in truth.</p>
<p>Like Qian Ziyan, Zhang Shutong</p>
<p>The gentleman's appearance is clear and well-behaved, the gentleman's behavior is ancient Confucian; Early in life, he stepped into the Ming Dynasty, and the Danxi pen was full of spring splendor; The edict was passed down from the purple clay book, and the autumn sound of the autumn sounded in the sky of the wooden sky; The autumn sound of the autumn sounds worried, and the sails hang high in ten widths of reeds; When the Jiang Zuo region will build a new capital, praised [their] magnificent plan; The Qin Huai wine stains [his] clothes, and the Jingjiang moon illuminates [his] robes. The bandit atmosphere suddenly rises in the eastern corner of the sea, and I will take a break in Songjiang; Hu Yaguang, the wonderful hand of portraiture, wrote this portrait for you; His spirit is radiant, his eyebrows and beard, and the old man of Songling can be called; Collection and books are better than leaving thousands of slaves; The world is waiting for you, may you not be a relict; If you should seek to ascend to the heavens, how different is it from the one in Hubei!</p>
<p>Like Tang Yun, Da Shi</p>
<p>A battlefield rises in front of Dashi Mountain, but [he] carries a pot of wine and gets drunk in the late spring; This madness is truly ridiculous, [he] is still the one who stood by and watched in those days.</p>
<p>Like Bao Tian Xiao, Man Weng</p>
<p>It is difficult to repay the teacher's love, and it is embarrassing to portray Wu Yan when old; I look like I am sitting idle in the shade of the pine, and I don't know what the next life will be like in this life.</p>
<h3>Professor (Woodcut)</h3>
<p>— Ke Yang</p>
<h3>Yellow Dusk</h3>
<p>— Zui Sheng</p>
<p>The time, it should be dusk.</p>
<p>If this is a moonlit night, on the clear blue sky, there is a bright comb-shaped moon hanging, and dense stars are scattered around. At that time, if you are leisurely walking in the cold streets and alleys, letting the clear light of the moon, like a light veil, cover the atmosphere around you, then you will deeply realize a kind of harmonious taste, in your nerves that are tired of the trivial matters of the day,</p>
<p>If you think the daytime is too annoying and midnight is too deep, then the most lovely will feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Listen! There came a burst of soft Xiao sounds, that tragic and sad tune, is it the sea love song of the poet? Or the sob of flowing water, or the remnant chirping of autumn insects! That desolate voice added a crack to the dusk air.</p>
<p>Are you a wanderer who is far away from your hometown! Then you will definitely feel your wandering heart, looking at the horizon, the clouds are vast, the ancient homeland is unknown, how much is desolate, the hometown thousands of miles away, the journey is long and the water is far away, buying a boat to go home, and waiting for what year and month?</p>
<p>The sound of the Xiao spread to the monks outside the ancient temple, the blue lamp, the red fish, that twilight bell of dawn life, who is willing to do it! Even if your Zen heart is like catkins, I am afraid you will not be able to restrain yourself, cherishing the prosperity of the world, and arousing warm reverie!</p>
<p>Boating in the dusk, what a poetic enjoyment it should be! A flat boat, floating on the lake, if you are with a close friend, facing the beauty, dark fragrance into your arms, will you think of the elegance of the Six Dynasties, in the depths of the bright moon, painting boats like clouds... But I think you will definitely be sad and gently whisper the poem "The prosperity is scattered with fragrance, the flowing water is merciless, spring is coming by itself"!</p>
<p>Dusk is also the best time to write. Whether it is the clear wind and bright moon, or the bleak wind and drizzle, in the quiet surroundings, who will come to disturb your quiet heart! If this is a moonlit and starry dusk, then you can write some beautiful essays, and what about the dusk of wind and rain? Tell you, it is most suitable to write some novels with tragic colors.</p>
<p>"The sunset is infinitely good, but it is near dusk." The rhyme of Suiyuan so deeply pulls the sorrow of middle-aged people long. Time flies like water, years are long, beauties are exhausted, and there is no way to stop time. You can only futilely complain about the passing youth, and how can you grasp it?</p>
<p>If you feel that the daytime is too annoying and midnight is too deep, then the most lovely time, it should be dusk.</p>
<p>The art review articles in this issue were originally scheduled to be published on Sunday, but were temporarily restricted by the length of the issue and changed to today. "One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood" will be suspended for one issue.</p>
<h3>After Viewing the Second Woodcut Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Jie Ding</p>
<p>This spring, I saw the "First National Woodcut Exhibition" of the National Woodcut Association. The images that remained were: a strong sense of realism, and the serious attitude of the artists. But there were few new styles.</p>
<p>Although only half a year has passed since the first exhibition, this time's woodcut exhibition presents many new forms and new contents. In particular, the exploration in terms of form is surprisingly broad, while the content does not have the same strong sense of realism as the last time.</p>
<p>Chinese farmers love tranquility and brightness, like the New Year pictures and comic strips they favor, which are all in this style. The development of woodcuts in national form is also developing along this path. The new styles seen in this woodcut exhibition all present this trend. This is quite correct and worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The lines of the blade are the most creative. In the works on the "Woodcut Selection," most of the figures depicted use the lines with a metallic and stone-like flavor that he created, inspired by the patterns he extracted from the inscriptions on ancient bronze tripods and steles. However, the eight paintings "Four Directions" and "Four Seasons" this time are another kind of line. The "metallic and stone quality" has not been lost, but also added the gentleness and beauty of Western style, and the bright and simple style of national form to form a charming symmetry and poetic lines, such as the "Winter" (also named "Shu") in "Four Seasons," which is full of power without being rough.</p>
<p>Huang Yongyu and Xi Xing's styles and lines are unique. Xi Xing's are symmetrical and gentle, but the breaks in the lines also show firmness and the flavor of the knife. Several decorative paintings are very neat. "Stories in the City" has enough composition, knife flavor, and wood flavor. Huang Yongyu's lines are as imaginative as his conception. These lines are best used to draw fairy tales.</p>
<p>Mai Gan is striving to explore new forms. In the first woodcut exhibition, there was "Overturn," which had a very strong painting flavor. This time, there is "Returning to Mother's Home," whose degree of refinement is even better than the former. There is "The Japanese Devils Dragged Away Her Husband," carved with a single-edged knife; "Waiting for Ferry," carved with a small round knife; "Picking Fruit," a stone carving; "Sick Child," a paper carving; four exquisite pieces such as "Barbarian Woman Hulling Rice"; and "In the Carriage," a sketch in white with intaglio carving.</p>
<p>Many people admire Ke Ping's "Vision of Hard Workers," which is indeed a painting with harmonious colors and profound meaning. His optimistic attitude makes this scene extremely beautiful. "Steel Coming out of the Furnace" is also a very powerful painting. Li Hua's intaglio and powerful style, "Quickly Help Him In," "After Unemployment," and "Condolences" are all works of skillful technique. Ke Tian's "Hunger" fully expresses the anger of hunger, Li Cun Song's "Making Rubber" has a very strong satirical flavor in both content and form, and Zhao Yannian's "Reminded Of" is also very easy to evoke sympathy.</p>
<p>In the exhibition, there is a set of consecutive woodcuts by Li Zhigeng, "Huang Nius Is Forced to Climb the Ridge," with a total of twenty-five pieces from beginning to end. The form of engraving is unified, and the typical depiction is also very deep, but there is no tight connection in meaning, and it can only be regarded as a series of illustrations for a novel. In the production of consecutive woodcuts, I think there are still many places that need to be further discussed.</p>
<p>From here, we see an increase in color woodcuts. Originally, woodcuts should be black and white pictures, and it is best to be dominated by monochrome. Only monochrome woodcuts can express the wood flavor, knife flavor, and the contrast of light and dark, and become a unique art. For example, Sokolov's colored woodcut "Bridge" in Soviet woodcuts is simply not much different from oil paintings.</p>
<p>Finally, I wish the future of woodcuts here! If woodcuts can meet the needs of the people, strengthen the creation of national forms and New Year's flavor, and raise the banner of serving the people, instead of becoming ivory tower objects with other minority "artists," its future will be unlimited.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Counselor's Office Replies with a Correct Interpretation of Equivalent Academic Ability</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, before and after the enrollment of new students in various schools, this newspaper received letters from young readers from all over the country, almost every day, asking about the interpretation of equivalent academic ability. In addition to replying to each letter separately based on what we know, for the sake of caution, we also wrote to the Ministry of Education for instructions. Recently, we received a letter from the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Education, which provided a very detailed answer. It is the same as what our organization previously answered. The original letter is disclosed below to inform young readers in various places.</p>
<p>"The Ministry has received your office's letter No. 1631 on social affairs, regarding how to interpret equivalent academic ability for high school graduates. After investigation, the so-called equivalent academic ability for applying to colleges or universities is stipulated in Article 13 of the Regulations on Enrollment of Public and Private Colleges and Universities in the 36th Academic Year promulgated by the Ministry, as students who have been out of school for more than one year and have completed the second year of high school before dropping out, and who submit the original academic transcript from the school they attended and pass the review, are allowed to apply with equivalent academic ability; for junior colleges or specialized courses that recruit junior high school graduates, the qualifications of students with equivalent academic ability should be handled in accordance with this; as for secondary schools recruiting students with equivalent academic ability, there are no restrictions on their qualifications. This is a corresponding reply for your reference! To the Social Service Section of the Shen Bao, from the Counselor's Office of the Ministry of Education."</p>
<p>Talent Wanted</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society has recently been entrusted by various parties to solicit the following talents. Those who are willing to apply may go to No. 80 Yandang Road (Hualong Road) (the back door of Fuxing Park) to discuss in person. (Due to time constraints, only those in this city will be considered for the time being.) One chemistry professor for a certain college, qualified as a graduate of a foreign university with more than four years of teaching experience, and the treatment is excellent. One mathematics and physics cum English teacher for a certain middle school in Anhui, requires a university degree, the monthly salary is 600 catties of wheat, and accommodation is provided, and travel expenses are also borne by the school. One mechanical drawing teacher for a certain vocational school, requires a university degree, and those with teaching experience are qualified as part-time teachers. One manager for a certain farm, who must be able to design plans. One all-purpose Chinese typist for a certain office. One casing worker for a certain factory in another city, qualified as having experience in manufacturing casings, and the treatment is excellent.</p>
<p>Southwest Clinic Serves the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>The Southwest Hospital outside the Small West Gate of this city was founded by the late famous doctor Zhu Rongsheng, and was well-known in Shanghai. It was severely damaged during the Anti-Japanese War, and its business was suspended for many years. It has now been repaired and renamed "Southwest Clinic," and will reopen on the 12th of this month. Medical doctor Wu Shiyuan and others will be hired to preside over the diagnosis and treatment of various departments, including internal and external medicine. Outpatient hours are from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm. Free for the poor and sick, it is truly good news for patients in this city.</p>
