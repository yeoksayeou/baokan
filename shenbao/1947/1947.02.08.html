<p>〔本報訊〕確息：張君動氏託雷震帶致主席之函中，某要求及措辭遠較原來之意見　爲緩和。最顯著之一點，爲原意見書要求行政院長一席，須由黨外人士担任，担經雷震一再解釋後，民社黨人員已考慮行政經騐及實際問題，最後決定取消此項要求。而中樞對改組政府之意　，至爲誠懇，將來實施改組時，中央與地方可全盤老慮。目前民社黨已在進行準備工作，張君勱氏下週內將晋京，謁主席面商實際問題。改組政府事如無意外變化，三月中可望完成。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕雷震於昨晚十一時搭夜車晋京，行前活動頗爲忙碌。中午於國際飯店的集民社黨要員多人，作赴京前最後之會商。午後五時訪來滬之吳文官長，將此次來滬接洽經過作一詳盡報吿。據雷氏吿記者：政府與民社黨之間，距離並不遠，外間所傳之各項條件恐非事實，張君勱因事不能同晉京，其寄致蔣主席之函件中，已將民社黨遲遲未能提出改組政府意見之理由及苦衷，加以說明，但並不一定，要求政府答覆。據個人觀察，政府改組短期內可成事實，除民社。靑年兩黨之外，社會賢達方面將由政府出面個別邀請參加。</p>
<h3>孫科縱論目前時局　政府決不願以軍事解決中共問題　改組政府數星期內可實行</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南京七日電〕立法院長孫科頃向本社記者發表談話，論列法越衝突，國內局勢及美國對日政策各點，分誌如下：</p>
<p>越南之衝突</p>
<p>越南之衝突事件，如向聯合國提出申訴，則中國當支持越盟共和國任何合理的要求。同時越南之衝突，倘發展至危及中國利益之程度，則吾人亦不得不考慮局勢，而採取新態度。法國倘謀以武力征服越南，則將被認爲帝國主義國家引起亞洲全體國家並中國在內之惡感。結果將導致一部份中國人通過中越邊界，而與越盟軍隊並肩作戰。惟報載中國政府擬組織遠征軍前往越南作戰之說，則非事實，中國承認越盟政府，尙待未來時局演變。且此種承認足使中法關係緊張，吾人自當加以避免，中法目前關係非常敦睦，並無嚴重爭點。截至目前爲止，中國並未參加越南衝突之任何一方，因此一問題與中國無關。惟將來越盟政府能自　外交時，吾人當歡迎越盟與吾人樹立關係之任何提議。</p>
<p>以言國內形勢，山東戰役正在進行中，對於國家前途，將有決定的影響。政府被迫以軍事措置對付中共之軍事攻擊，政府　準備並願意隨時恢復和談，但軍事活動爲改變中共態度之唯一途徑。政府議意希望中共採取合理的路徑，但彼等若不出此，則彼等一日以武力抵抗，戰事將一日持續。中共軍進攻政府軍，因其對本身武力信仰太甚，但中共軍不能依照預定計劃佔據徐州，現且準備自臨沂撤退矣。戰局漸與彼等不利，惟政府決不願亦從禾以軍事方法解決中共問題。以政府之改組而論，或將於今後數星期內實行，政府正羅致各黨，共負政府之責任。馬歇爾將軍之聲明，承認美國調解之失敗但已加强政府加速實施憲法之熱望。美國退出三人小組與軍調部乃局勢使然。山國問題必須由中國人自行解決，馬帥不過爲調人，渠爲美國人，有大國爲其後盾，故其調處工作太似外國之干涉。假令馬帥爲瑞士等小國之公民，則情形即不同。</p>
<p>莫斯科會議</p>
<p>記者問及來日莫斯科會議討論中國問題之可能性，孫氏稱：余不知莫斯科會議如何能涉及中國，須知任何外來的干涉，足以引起我國民之憤慨，馬歇爾之失敗，前車可鑒。</p>
<p>以言日本間題，美國目前之政策實屬錯誤，麥帥似太依　反動份子以遂分其目的。</p>
<p>日本統治階級正爲捲土重來作掩護，並正設法使麥帥相信日本之民主與不再有軍事野心。中國受日本侵略最重，對於該國局勢之發展非常關切，惟恐日本拓張政策死灰復燃。日太問題與日前之美蘇對立聯擊，每一方均欲利用日本爲工具以推行其未來目標，此種情形足使猜忌加甚，而播下未來衝突之種子。故遭受日本侵略之全體國家，應密切合作，遠東委員會亦應增强，勿使有名無實，庶爲上策。所望美國博採衆議，而放棄其現行政策則善矣。</p>
<p>中蘇之關係</p>
<p>以言中蘇關係，一向滿意，但應加以增進。東北問題亦有解決必要。　意談判乃避負誤解唯一辦法。接政大連，隨時可行，此事檕於目前在東北進行之談判結果，此項談判大抵爲技術性質，惟亦有若干方面，標準較高。</p>

<h3>社論　輸出推廣委員會的功能</h3>
<p>政府對於出口貿易，其重要的措施，照過去情形，的略如下：（一）廢止出口稅，（二）舉辦借款，如打包，押匯及開放信用狀等，（三）收買生絲，並準備收買茶葉，至最近又實行，（四）出口匯票的補助，和（五）設立輸出推廣委員會。</p>
<p>所謂輸出推廣委員會，其應負的任務如何，我們曾略貢意見，認爲應側重實施，不可僅備諮詢的性質，亦不可僅具輔導與通常行政的性質。而此次明確規定爲「期達到所負推進督導及研討發展輸出貿易之重要任務，其本身並不經營任何輸出貿易，更無獨佔控制輸出貿易之意，」則其性質，似仍着重於諮詢與輔導方面，與我們的期望，顯有出入。所以然者，我們的重點，放在收買上，而政府則採取補助卽津貼手段。所以不需要直接經營，更不需要獨佔貿易。那麽，這個輸出推廣委員會，實際上自然要變爲輸出諮詢委員會，或輔導委員會了。」</p>
<p>話雖如此，就推進督導，及研討發展這幾點上說，這個委員會，確也不爲無益，而且很覺得重要，理由如次：</p>
<p>（一）是具有提撕警覺的作用出口貿易的盛衰，決不單是出口商的利害問題，而是整個的國民經濟所係，這項理油，我們迭經指陳過。今有一個政府所信賴的專門機構，經常在研究，調査，建議，輔助，用以喚起當局的注意，這項效用，自然比牠本身的作用，還要有價値。</p>
<p>（二）是負有溝通意見的作用　照該會的組織，除掉當然和指定委員外，還有中外知名的專家，除掉另置執行委員會外，並在各重要商埠設立分會，其作用當然在集思廣益，並搜集各地的情報和意見。那麽，關於A現行辦法的缺點，B應辦未辦的建議，和C各地工商業的隱痛和困難，諒可以儘量搜羅，忠實地盡其傳達的責任了。</p>
<p>（三）是負有實際改進的責任，該會本身，雖不經營任何出口貿易，但其規定的任務四項，中有A解除出口物資所遭迅之困難，B獎勵農產，加工製造，C改善辦法，促進出口，和D促進國外消費市塲等條款，則在出口貿易上，該會至少將盡其間接扶助，和直接促進的責任。換句話說，該會雖不是直接經營出口，却是間接策進出口，便利出口，所以稱爲推廣輸出，也不算名不副實。</p>
<p>問題是目標太大，顯見得太任重而道遠了。要使這張支票完全兌現，確實達到推廣輸出的目的，似乎不是普通一般的坐而論道，或者打打算盤的委員會所能濟事，也不是單單調製些表格，弄上一大堆數字所能奏效。且拿牠的第一項任務來說：其原文爲「研討並解除國內各地各項出口物資所遭遇之各種困難，」其中內容何等廣泛？所有困難，又何等嚴重？時下流行的一般難題，如交通，治安，工資，利息，捐稅，動力等問題，幾乎無不可包括在內。單說研討，已非易事，要進一步加以解除，僅僅「集中工商界之經騐與力量，」恐怕還是不够。必須集中政府和民間的經騐與力量，或者「方能有濟」乎？</p>
<p>至於推動出口，現所施行的補助制度，自然是一個有力的工具。不過土貨能否出口，其要點在是項貨價，在國外市塲上，能否鎖得開去？也就是說，給與補助以後，其成本能否减低到相當限度？須知經營出口貨的，其中並非全部是出口商，大部份乃是中間商，製造商，運商和囤商。他們與國外市塲的關係，並不十分密切，因而遇到有利悄息，便都紛紛漲價，乘機拉抬。這短短的兩日以來，出口貨只見上漲，不聞减低，情勢已狠顯然了。照此推測，這項補助費所收到的效果，能有幾何，狠成問題。何况生絲，鷄蛋這一類土貨，因爲成本太高，據說：獲得補助以後，還是無法輸出。所以酌定合理的價格，由政府出資收購這一點，是否應當放棄，似乎依奮値得考慮。我們相信：凡複雜的事態，必須用複雜的方法來解決。現在所行出口外匯，予以補助的辦法，雖是一個及時補救的良法。但是單靠這個辦法，是否還嫌單純些？又劃一的加倍補助，不分等差，是否切中時宜？時論也頗不一致。好得還有一個輸出推廣委員會可以隨時硏究改進，其所屬的執行委員會，並已於昨日成立。這個議題，我們願意貢獻該會，作爲研究的資料。</p>

<h3>前製革廠工要復工</h3>
<p>我們是一羣失業工人，戰前在閘北潭子灣地方，敵人所經營的江南製革廠工作，戰事爆發時，都抱着國家觀念，自動停工，放棄了陞工賞工及儲蓄金，然毅的離開了廠奔走他鄉，度着那非人生活。現在我國勝利了，敵人屈膝了，而該廠房屋，已由政府經濟部接收，那末我們應有復工希望。——可是國家收回這所廠房，並不製造皮革，聽說改作四川榨油廠，我們雖想入廠工作，當然不能稱爲復員，不過我們的唯一目的就是工作，唯一的對象，就是這所廠房，不論復員也罷，新工人也罷，祗要肯用我們，於願已足。但不知要用什麽方式，向什麼地方申請，因想貴報向主公道，請借一角餘地，予以刊登，敬求社會當局不吝指示爲感。（前江南製革廠四十餘工人代表楊尙友）</p>
<h3>崑山農貨惠不及農</h3>

<h3>託管制日委治島嶼問題　美表示政策不變　惟決定暫緩向安理會提出</h3>

<p>又中國航空公司一四五號〇四七型滬渝綫班機，於上月卅日在湖北天門縣境失事後，對失事原因，傳說不一，近又謠傳因該機機翼上奘載有重七十公斤之二百根金條，致失去平衡而　禍云云。本市地檢處黄首席檢察官對該案頗爲重視，爲調査該機失事眞相及責任問題，特於昨日派沈祖壽，朱錫瑜兩檢察官，親赴龍華機塲調査。兩檢察官於昨晨十時赴機塲調査，至下午三時返處。</p>

<h3>提出大火因素八點　全體消防員函參會呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市新閘區消防處全體消防員，以西摩路火災案發生後，輿論界羣加指摘，致三五害羣之馬失職，而有殃及池魚之患，昨特致函市參議會呼籲，內略稱：武定路火災已成爲市民飯後談笑之資料，消防員已個個成爲勒索搶刦之强盜，致全體遭蒙不白之寃，殊不公道，對於本案，吾等願意接受眞理，及檢舉不法人員。</p>
<p>至於武定路大火之延燒原因，絕非由於消防人員之勒索，歸納其因素有如下八項：（一）現本市所有之各種消防器材，乃前工部局時代經過數十年使用者，際此隆冬季節，天氣酷寒，加以各消防區隊之軍間無水汀設置，致影響救火車受凍，而稽遲時刻。（二）救火車與救急車之汽汕。時起恐慌，全部消防隊每月之汽汕，僅得一千五百加侖，平均支配各分區隊，每月均感不敷，故救火車時生無汕之處，此亦爲原因之一。（三）工部局時代，每人有皮靴二雙，現在早經取消，唯一之橡皮靴已千孔百瘡，無法防水，又制服迄今未換，而警局業經撥到麥爾登呢，殊屬不解，每當救火歸來，寒氣徹骨，熱水濯浴旣不可能，連更換制服亦辦不到，痛苦萬分。（四）消防人員薪俸微薄，而物價高漲，個人已難溫飽，遑論養家，致影響工作精神，多數皆灰心消極，故希望當局予以保隙，凡因公殉職者，公家應負担其家屬之生活費。則仝人等自應奮不顧身，以完成吾等偉大之使命。（五）本市各處太平龍頭損壞失竊甚多，延續救火時間，希望市民協助保養。（六）水帶亟須增添，現各分隊之水帶多腐舊不堪，每逢火災，即吿爆裂，致躭誤施救工作。（七）前工部局時代，一旦火警發生時，消防處，警察局，電力公司及自來水公司均派員到塲協助。而現時交通擁擠，秩序紊亂，影響施救工作甚巨。（八）現各區隊室內室外之窗戶及電燈泡大都損壞，照獲應由當局負責修理，而現時其一切費用皆由我等負祖，實不勝其剝削，謹望參議會諸位代表主持公道云云。</p>
<h3>風氣須改良　待遇應改善　市長如是表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕爲陝西南路火災案，某報載有吳市長曾表示「市府的雷聲是大的，至於雨點的大小問題全在法院」之言。吳市長昨特向記者鄭重表示，並未發表此言。僅稱該案之刑事部份歸法院辦理，行政部份待調委會調查完畢，另作處置。關於消防隊員之風氣，吳市長昨表示必須加以改良。待遇問題，確有改善之必要，當局自應盡力設法。悄防設備，於可能範圍巾亦需謀其改進。現當局正嚴密計劃中。</p>
<h3>寃枉了兩警　經查明釋放</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據警局張處長語記者，因大火案涉嫌被押之一八五〇號及三三五號兩警士，因得六六〇弄三號災主楊俊三及殷秉權之證明，謂該兩警士當時係見義勇爲，並無趁火打刧情事。同時警局方面，亦以查無實據，故已於昨日交保釋放。</p>
<h3>發掘王家火塲　繼續發現用具</h3>

<h3>見火不救乘機索賄　地檢處正積極偵查</h3>
<p>西摩路大火案，經五人調査委員會，將調查所得有關刑事方面之各項資料，擬具報吿書，呈報市長，經批送法院依法偵訊後，據地檢處黄首席檢察官表示，消防員救火係職責所在，見火不救乘機索賄，實屬違法敗紀，本處現正積極進行偵查中，如確有此種不法行爲，自常依法提起公訴。</p>
<h3>調查委員　繼續參觀各區　工具多殘破人員發牢騷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路火災調査委員會主委葛克信等，續於昨日下午二時，赴新閘區，滬西區，泰山區等各救火會參觀消防設施。舉凡火警控制室，救火車，帮浦，皮帶，救險車，防毒面具等均曾仔細觀察，發現損壞者極多，尤以皮帶情形最慘。十餘年來，消防設施從未增添，致完好者絕無僅有，多數皆百孔千瘡，一補再補。又現時應用之救火車，至少亦擁有十年以上之歷史，亦有用至二三十年者，致運轉不靈，因而影響出發時間。</p>
<p>各區隊之消防員多數呌苦連天，且皆向記者等大發牢騷。新閘區中之一〇五號消防警昨向各記者訴苦謂：年紀已活到七十一歲，幹救火工作已有三十五年，今犬這種苦是頭一天吃！要不是吳市長還欠我二千多元錢（按係指工部局退職金），十五萬元錢一月的薪水，我早跑了。</p>

<h3>地政局裁員困難　人手已感不敷支配　裁員必將減低效率</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕最近市參議員及外界一部份人士，皆有地政局可緊縮開支，裁去一部份人員之表示。記者爲此特往訪該局探詢意見，據吿：地政局與警察局，工務局等不同。彼等所作者爲經常工作，如維持治安或修築馬路等等，地政局目前之主要工作則爲地籍登記與土地測量。前租界及僞府遺留之地籍圖表約有七十萬件，目前亟待整理，而勝利後之舉行地籍登記，申請換發土地所有權狀，因手續繁複，人員不敷，窮去年一年之力，祗發出五萬張左右。目前尙有十二萬餘張待發。其他經常工作尙有請求分地換證等等。至土地測量，則猶如戶口淸査，須於短期內集中全力完成之，否則土地時有變化，即不易査淸。此事非主管其事，身歷其境者不易明瞭。現地政局已感人手不敷，即欲完成目前工作，預計尙需二年，故即欲裁員，亦當在二年之後。如參議會通過目前一定要栽，祗能就行政人員部門攷慮，但有一原則即需在不妨碍工作效率下，但業務人員則希望添加。如行政與業務人員皆欲裁减，則預計之工作完成期限，必致延長，且人手一少，不能集中爲之，效率反爲减低云云。</p>

<h3>唐懷羣遭刦　損失二千萬</h3>

<h3>汽油並不缺貨　用戶何必恐慌　油商如此說</h3>
<p>〔本訊〕汽油恐慌現象，日來仍未改善，昨日起各加油站雖已限制每車每次祗准加汕三加侖，但依然供不應求，路邊列隊等候加油之汽車長蛇陣到處可見。據油公司某負責人之意見，迭成此種現象之主要原因，實由於不必要之羣衆恐慌心理，至於所以發生恐慌心理，不外乎下列數端：（一）懷疑本市存油不足，此後進口困難。（二）半月前油公司因結匯手續遲緩，海關未予啓封，油源曾一度斷絕，車主深恐此後再發生同樣情形。（三）謠傳外匯率即將變更，汽油價格將予提高。（四）有人乘機搶購大量汽汕，存貯屋內，或以黑市出售。基於此種心理，汽汕需求因此激增，且以現時全市機動重數達二萬餘輛（公用局最近之枕計），的爲戰前之一倍，在「一窩蜂」之情形下，各加油站遂時見擁塞及售罄之現象。</p>
<p>每三月進口數額二百五十萬美金</p>
<p>事實上據該負責人稱，本市存汕不盧匱乏，現時汽汕進口限額每三個月爲二百五十萬美金，足够供應正常需要，不必採用限額分配等限制。至於價格即使因外匯調整而增加，用戶現時所能積儲之數量亦屬有限，不値得因區區之數而　火災之危險，故深望市民勿庸人自擾。</p>
<h3>三公司會商　訂改善辦法</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕市公用局以近來汽油供求失常，汽車在路邊到隊等候之現象。非特妨礙交通，且有人乘機購得大量油料，存貯屋內，易於發生火災，爲避免造成黑市及保障公衆安全起見，特於二月五日召集亞細亞，德士古，美孚三公司代表開會討論，訂定改善辦法三項：（一）各公司存油甚多，如輸油工具不敷應用時，應將加油站所需汽油儘先運送，俾能大量供應。（二）凡向加油站加油之車輛脾照號碼及汕量，由三公司詳細記錄，如發現有非正常加油，企圖將油料貯藏之車商，經調查屬實後，即通知各站，嗣後對於該商車輛停止加汕。（三）加汕站所有汕料，應隨到隨售』售罄爲止，如經管人員有拒絕供應，企圖貯藏，以黑市出售情事，得由市民向公用局密吿，經調査屬實後，照章從嚴辦理。</p>

<h3>銀根鬆濫流言孔多　金價已闖過五關　美鈔較前猛漲一千二</h3>
<p>烚赤昨勢成潦原，銀根既吿鬆濫，拋售見稀，以致新買如履坦途，有恃無恐，再創新高峰，惟高後頗多脫手，市况多盤，晨開四八二萬至四八四萬，即吿上升，惟初時尙形穩和，開後逐步上升，十時後，央行以四九五萬之價，配給四六〇條，入後即叩五〇〇萬關，浮多一度自動了結，曾回低至四九一萬，無奈盤低之後，仍難改觀，於是五〇〇萬大關，終吿穿出，新買再來，漲勢加速，高價達五二二萬，多方仍有獲利了結者，近午曾回落至五一〇萬內，但午刻仍站五一五萬左右，午後即交會回落至五〇七萬，隔日交易仍見挺俏，市塲流言孔多，再創五三三萬新高價，而後有回，惟收後塲外仍見喊高，結果較前收漲起四十四萬，飾金掛五十五萬，銀元再挺，暗拆銀根仍鬆，息價不過一角半左右。外幣隨金市同挺，　市美鈔晨開九千二至九千四，盤旋而升，午刻終於穿出一萬元大關，午後　續趨昂，高價再創，迫近一〇五〇〇元結束，結果較前收猛漲一二〇〇元，港票奇俏，自一八〇〇元起，一再躍進至二〇〇〇元外，結果亦漲二〇〇元，港匯一九〇〇元至一九二〇元，印滙二三二〇元至二三四〇元，英滙三〇五〇〇元左右，成交仍僅港滙較多，餘者有求少供。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣執委會　議決設置十七小組　各組主持人均已指定</h3>

<h3>絲綢一致轉好　人絲漲風尤厲</h3>
<p>昨市金鈔在漲，絲綢一致帶好，尤以人造絲漲風最厲，一二〇號金三馬有光上午四百五十八萬元成六一箱後，即冉冉上升，連續高抬，迄午做五百萬元收盤，下午又喊高二十萬元，結果比上日大七十萬元弱，不過昨市因喊價扶搖直上，買戶却步，成交殊稀，七五號半光價喊七百萬元，可謂物稀爲貴，究其連日高漲之因，無非因綢廠均已開工，所有一部份原料，去冬生產貸款作抵押不能動用，且絲綢聯營公司所發料機，手續尙未完竣，以致一部份廠商，勢必向黑市搜購，持貨者抓住此一弱點，更適逢金鈔上漲，於是乘機扳俏，但一俟料機辦妥，配給照舊發售後，定有低降之可能，廠經昨前市喊價亦提高，殊鮮成交，下午因金價又升，乃略有去胃，D字等級做價五百九十萬元，比上日大起二十萬元，普通貨及干經均喊大二三十萬元不等，綢貨受原料高漲影響，因成本關係，廠　類皆提高，昨美亞被面上午成交價三百五十五萬元，下午塲外喊大十五萬元賣出，大誠格子璧　去　頗濃，本埠綢緞店競相購進，上午做價一萬四千五百元，下午塲外喊五千元，舉錫縐上午做價四千元，下午喊四千二百元。</p>
<h3>紗市漲風復熾</h3>
<p>昨日紗市漲風復　，粵帮頗有　　，重磅雙馬復創四百廿五萬之新高價，普通廿支棉紗亦跟漲三四十萬，卅二支及四十二支變股細紗，因各廠吸吶，狂升四五十萬，最後收盤趨勢仍昂，人心堅挺。</p>
<h3>布價猛漲</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，細布因平價關係，塲內甚鮮做開，塲外市氣頗形熱鬧，陽鶴細布每疋在升八千五百元，餘如AAA彩球五福及龍頭布等價，均上升五干元至七千元，深色士林布受細布牽動，廠盤提高，同業爭先購進，安安藍布每疋猛升四萬至七萬元，府綢再升五千元至二萬元</p>
<p>昨日棉花市氣堅挺，國光紗廠購進白洛區花一百包，送廠價爲四十九萬五千元，同業交易不多，人心趨俏。</p>
<h3>吳市長切實表示　暹米無限制供應　議價不許改</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長爲食米問題，於昨日下午向記者發表談話稱：米市漲風經政府儘量拋售暹米及嚴厲取締遠反議價商號，原可於本星期內解決；但因受黃金上漲影響，稍受阻礙，現無論如何，下週內可望抑平。近日蘇州河已到有一二百艘米船，目前似正在觀望風色，視政府是否調整議價。本人於最近亦曾接到市民來信，所謂榖賤傷農，指政府抑制米價，農民損失頗大。現在所欲說明者，政府准許米價跟隨其他物價，但不准超過其他物價。依現在黑市計算，實已超過其地物價，故不能不加以抑制。今後本市即使白粳一粒不來，現存暹米，亦可維持至八月底。故市府對本市食米問題依然抱定：（一）無限制供應暹米，（二）白粳在七萬六千元議價內可以出售，（三）目前不準備調整議價。</p>
<p>米商違反議價社局依法懲處</p>
<p>昨南北米市客貨共到五百石左右，社會局繼續拋售暹米，計北市塲四千一百九十五包，南市場一千七百五十包。共五千九百四十五包。至違反白　議價之經售商號，該局昨又議續查獲二十三家。連前七十八家共一百零一家。其中黑市價高者爲十萬元。且有累犯者，其懲處辦法已由社會局擬定，據悉爲：在九萬元以下者予以警吿。九萬元以上者則吊取賬册或其他足資證明之證據，依照取締違反限價議價條例第二條第六條之規定，分別處以罰金。數額待呈請市府核定後執行。</p>
<p>商人無利可圖市面白米潛踪</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市食米價格，因當局決心抑平，不准改定議價，故近日米市中，除社會局拋售之　米與各米店摻雜之次號米外，國產白米，幾省無處可買之現象，據米商表示，近日無錫方面，白粳市價爲八萬元，其他各縣之米價，亦在七八萬元之間，裝運來滬，則非八九萬元不辦，本市食米議價，旣較外埠米價爲低，一般商人無利可圖，自無裝運食米來滬之理。近日常局對米店存貨調查極嚴，故各米店多將所存少量白粳　中脫售，黑市交易亦逐漸减少，南北　市塲中，已形成　一色之暹米交易。蘇州河中雖有白米運到，惟皆待復面佑，不肯輕易售出，故本市米價，能否全面抑平，　米區米價之高低，亦爲決定條件之一。</p>
<p>雜糧豆餅市況俏利</p>

<h3>食糖黑市價格飛漲　吳市長令台糖公司　限制商人任意請配</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食糖中砂赤砂配售價格，甫經審議會於日前自每担十三萬調整爲十四萬。速日黑市價迭見上漲，昨日更達高峯。吳市長特爲此事於昨日下午發表談話稱：上月全月份糖商向台糖公司申請之配售量共祇一萬一千餘噸。現因見黑市價格高漲，於本月份第一星期即申請配給達一萬二千噸。商人此種重利觀念，實屬非是，現已下令台糖公司對木月份之申請配給者，一律按照上月份標準分配。一面已飭令社會局嚴密注意黑市糖價。並望商民勿故意抬高價格囤積居奇。</p>

<h3>獻辭</h3>
<p>這一頁不只是一家國貨工廠發展的小史，而且是整個中國民族工業艱苦奮圖的過程。</p>
<p>裕民毛羢線廠成立迄今，已屆十年。這十年是多麽偉大的時代！祖國的抗戰，終於獲致勝利。裕民廠初告創辦，就在事變開始時毀了。但它的主持者不屈不撓，在濁流中的孤島重建基業，為民族工業博取廣大的前程。太平洋戰爭爆發，滬市整個淪陷，敵寇無　地榨取一切，在這最黑暗的一刻，它甘願停業，拒絕與敵偽的合作。勝利了，它重新抬起頭來，負起興國建業的任務。這不是一切忠貞不移的國貨工廠的縮影嗎？</p>
<p>紀念這偉大的十年，更希望在未來的十年中，努力進展，使中國民族工業　　日上，與世界先進國並駕齊驅，完成建設時代最重大的任務。</p>
<h3>創業十年紀</h3>
<p>本公司成立於民國二十六年五月，資本為國幣三十五萬元。自購廠基十六畝餘於謹記路龍華路口，並向英國訂購最新式紡毛機械，廠屋興工建築，未及兩月，而八一三戰事發生，建築工程陷於停頓。且該處地臨軍事區域，無從派員駐守，致已建墻垣等工程，悉被摧毀無存。迨至民國二十八年，另行勘定現在廠址（新會路一四二號），租地告屋，裝置機器，即行開工，再接再厲，為國貨工業而奮鬥。嗣感資金不敷運用，爰於民國二十九年及三十年兩度增資，至國幣一百十萬元。均經呈奉　經濟部變更登記，所有出品雙洋牌雙手牌老鷹牌地球牌粗細羢線，行銷各埠，頗博好評，大有供不應求之勢。本公司益自振奮，悉心研究，精勵是圖。旋值太平洋戰事爆發，毛條原料，來源滯阻，工作陷於停頓，維時敵燄方張，覬覦廠產，魍魎慣技，威脅利誘，剛柔兼施，本公司兀不為動，始終嚴守崗位，抱寗為玉碎不為瓦全之精神，堅拒到底。並為保全資金起見，將資金先後兩次繳還於股東，為應付當時環境計，權宜處置，藉息仔肩，而待來蘇。自前秋勝利實現，滬工廠相繼復工，本公司重振旗鼓，增加資本至國幣十億元，廣事生產，力謀振整，冀於建國復興之途，聊盡綿薄於萬一焉。</p>
<h3>消息</h3>
<p>據傳該公司此次舉行成立十周紀念會，儀式隆重，所發請柬均隨附入場券。來賓必須憑券入場，　會場地位有限，為維持秩序起見，每券一人，無券概不通融云。</p>

<h3>地球和雙洋</h3>
<p>地球，全世界的人們都在地球上生活，人們離開不了地球，地球天天在轉動，一分一秒鐘也在轉動，它把時代推進，也給人們在生活方面，逐漸地改進。科學的昌明，思想的革新，這都是由人們在地球上天賦的本能。裕民地球牌羢線，以地球為商標，其含義不僅是希望把這種優美的出品，推廣到全地球，而實是具有給地球上人們的生活應該日日新又日新的警惕，所以地球牌，是一種廣義的商品，它能在這地球的一角。享了盛譽，倒是天經地義之事。</p>
<p>至於雙洋，在過去以銀為本位的中國，銀洋鈿是民間誰都看重的。銀色是一種純潔的顏色，它有光彩，但沒有黃金那樣的俗氣，非常樸素，十分可愛。裕民以雙洋為商標的雙洋羢線，一方面是表示它的光輝，一方面是遍及民間的意思。</p>
<p>同是商標，既要雅俗共賞，又要竟義深長。地球牌羢線，和雙洋牌羢線的商標，意義既明，其銷行不脛而走，當然自在意中的了！</p>

<h3>毛紡績工程關于「注油」　工作之重要性</h3>
<p>— 盛蔚</p>
<p>毛紡績所用之原毛經過了一度洗毛工程的洗滌後附着在羊毛纖維上原有的洋脂大部均被洗去僅有1－3％之油量殘留在上面且羊毛纖維自從經過了肥皂和　性的作用後其纖維的表面變成了粗糙同時也失去了原有的柔軟性若就把這種羊毛纖維放進其次的各種紡績工程中經過數重機械的操作則其纖維因了相互的摩擦勢必受到折斷損傷而致形成一種不良的製品在紡績工程上要想補救這弊病唯有施以一種所　「注油」的工作。</p>
<p>羊毛纖維經過了「注油」工作後其對於技術和製品的優點略述于后：</p>
<p>一，减少Carding，Gilling，Cornbing等各種紡績準備工程中之纖維和纖維間的摩擦抵抗使纖維减少折斷損傷率。</p>
<p>二，使Cornbing和Drafting之工作易於操作增加粗紗中纖維之彈力。</p>
<p>三，防止纖維在紡績中之飛散和减少屑量之消耗。</p>
<p>其次就是選擇「注油」所用的油質也是一件重要的事以下幾點是關於檢查油質的條件也值得來研究的。</p>
<p>一，能在各纖維的表面上極易擴張使纖維和纖維間有一種潤滑性而能减少它的摩擦抵抗防止靜電的發生帮助率伸作用减少落毛飛毛的折扣。</p>
<p>二，在大氣中具有安定性而不起化學作用無着色性對於纖維及操作之機械針布等不致損害。</p>
<p>三，易於乳化而能安定在紡績中不起凝固作用無揮發現象及無惡臭遺留於製品上且易於洗滌。</p>
<p>四，燃點高經過「注油」工作的纖維無自燃之危險性。</p>
<p>照上述數點的規定在油類中以橄欖油為最適合故歷來都拿它作為「注油」的最上原料因此種油的價值過高近來有改用其他礦物油或植物油來代替但用高級原料製造高級製品時還是使用橄欖油。</p>
<p>因為原料有粗毛，細毛，屑毛，間絲毛等的不同其所施的汕量當然也不同由毛類的區別而注以適量的油量普通一般的注油量：</p>
<p>梳毛鈔約施以0.5－5％，紡毛紗約自3－15％經過化炭工作的短毛纖維則加以20％。</p>
<p>在施油前若先用熱水加入油中而攪拌使變成乳白色後再洒上羊毛則比較經濟而纖維的表面上也容易擴張均一，</p>
<p>根據紡績名家多人的研究凡經過「注油」工作的紡績原料其紡出的紗支可以增加8－10's由此而知凡欲紡出較高較細之優良製品其對于「注油」工作必不可將它輕忽了。</p>
<h3>染料之節省與色彩之改進</h3>
<p>— 鼎動</p>
<p>染色之主要目的，在於如何用最低廉之成本，染成色彩鮮艶之成品。其鮮明度雖於所用染料本身有直接關係，然以本人經騐所得，亦可用下列二法改進之：</p>
<p>一，染料之配合，不能超出四種以上。種數愈多，愈易使染出之成品發灰。</p>
<p>二，應用原染液染色。普通水內，常含有少量之鈣鹽，使染成之色彩稍暗。如應用原染液後，此弊可以免除。不但可使色澤鮮艶，且可節省染料，燃料，酸，元明粉及用水量。對於成品之成本，即可减累。</p>
<p>上述二種方法，甚易實行。第二法稍感困難：因染液中之染料成份不易測定，以致成品色彩未能一律，且色彩不易均勻而發花。故用原染液染色，應選用染色性良好之原料。至於測定染液中所剩之染料成份，可用下列二法測定之：</p>
<p>一，設將所需3％之染料液傾入試樣杯內，加4％硫酸和20％元明粉，並加水使其總量為三〇C.C.，取出二五C.C.，放置一旁，用常法染試樣，染出後絞乾，並加水使染液至原來之二七五C.C.，取出一部放入比色管內，同時取先前二五C.C.液中之一C.C.，放入刻度比色管內，加水冲淡，使其色與另一比色管之液體相同。假定一C.C.未染液需加水八·五C.C.，才能與已染液相同，期液內所竊之染料（1＋8.5＝0.12）百分之十二，試樣吸着百分之八十作。</p>
<p>二，在第一法已染之染液內，加2％硫酸及使與前試樣色彩相同之染料。如所加染料液為2.6％，則原染液內所剩之染料成份為百分之十三·三三，（2.6＋3×100）試樣所吸者為百分之八十六·六六。</p>
<p>此二種試騐之結果極為相似；但第一法較為準確。如酸性媒染料則染前與染後之色彩絕然不同；故以第二法為妥。至於併色染液之測定，其理與上述相同，讀者必能舉一反三，茲不贅言。</p>

<h3>我談羢線編結</h3>
<p>— ……馮秋萍……</p>
<p>羢線編結之發明，歐美各國，早已刋有編結樣本，為提倡手工藝之一。觀之吾國，實少研究編結家，須知羢線服裝，累便柔軟，外穿內着，均甚相宜，實居服裝中之首席，而上下人仕都適宜穿着。歐美雖早有創編各種式樣，惟適於外人穿着。萍有鑒於此，乃傾力研究各種羢線服裝，合於國人穿着；更為毛羢界推廣營業，於女界多一出路。羢線與編結之關係，情同手足。抗戰之前，萍已將平日研究各種羢線服裝之各咱花樣，彙訂樣本，題名秋萍毛線刺繡編結法，曾並假座電台作空氣中　教授，使外埠愛好編結仕女，亦能得到研究機會。自抗戰軍興。毛羢線已受統制，得暫告退休。勝利後處在高喊建國聲中，女界應各謀自立生齊，羢線編結為高尚藝術，極應作進一步之發展，使在女界多一職業。國產毛羢線中地球雙洋兩種，秋萍已試用多年質料可稱首屈一指，今逢上海裕民毛羢廠舉行十週紀念大會，特願鄭重介紹於各界。</p>

<h3>羢線的常識</h3>
<p>— 學智</p>
<p>羢線編結品在我們「衣」的一項中，已佔有極重要的地位了。　最大的優點，就是毫無耗　，雖然破舊，仍可拆了重結；其次就是應用很廣：無論男女老幼，身上一切衣着：如帽子，圍巾，內衣，外套，褲子，手套及鞋襪等，無不相宜。此外，利用羢線編結毯子，及刺繡等裝飾品，也極合宜，這一點，在歐美早已很普遍地在通行了。至於柔軟舒適，經久耐用，已經盡人皆知，毋須贅述。</p>
<p>不過，一樣是羢線，也大有好壞；除了羊毛本身品質上，有優劣分別外，在紡製技術上，更有粗細是否均勻，寬緊是否適度，色澤是否光潔鮮艶，分量是否準足等條件，也很重要的。</p>
<p>所以，當你選購羢線的時候，必須注意上列各點。比方說：太寬鬆的羢線，結成衣服之後，就要起毛結　，太緊呢，又要發硬，沒有彈性。</p>
<p>地球牌羢線和雙洋牌羢線，已具備了上項標準條件；今天是牠們問世十週紀念，也就是說：牠們是有十年歷史的老牌羢線了。</p>
<p>關於羢線洗滌的時候，也有幾點應當注意，（一）不要把肥皂擦在羢線上，必須先泡成肥皂水，然後將羢線浸入，（二）溫度不要太高，（三）不要用手搓擦，　輕漂汰，（四）不可用手絞，由水中拎起由牠自乾，（六）勿在强烈日光下　晒。</p>
<p>至於貯藏羢線的時候，要注意到已否乾透。防蛀品如樟腦等當然是省不了的。</p>

<h3>關於文天祥二三事</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>小引</p>
<p>人生自古誰無死，</p>
<p>留取丹心照汗靑！</p>
<p>世變方亟，九九無俚，乃取架上史範以消　寒。讀「宋史」及「文文山集」，不覺大有所感。當文天祥從北營逃亡之際，進退狼狽，無識之徒，竟目之爲北人奸細。一代忠良，被誣至斯，可勝浩歎！從知事理不明，忠奸不分，自古而然，不始今日。幸而靑史留存，耿耿不滅，所謂「留取丹心照汗靑」者，天祥眞有先見之明也！</p>
<p>乃擇其中二三事，兼參考他書，寫成此文，非云表彰，聊供消遺。古人云：百無一用是書生。書生無用，亦不自今日始，今爲此不急之務，是否亦屬無用之表現，則己亦不得而知之矣。</p>
<p>即錄爲序，以冠全文。</p>
<p>十二義士考</p>
<p>當臨安爲元兵攻破，天祥正爲左丞相，奉命到敵營。敵人遂把他留下，解往北方。到了京口，賴杜滸等之助，用盡智力，歷經危險，卒得脫逃。這次一同逃出虎口的，共有十二人，我們稱之爲十二義士。後來這十二個人，在經過千辛萬苦後，有四人中途逃避，所以只賸了八人。但逃　的四人，雖有始無終，然死裏求生，亦人情之常，不過不及其他八人的意志聲定，始終如一罷了。就事論事，究竟還勝過那遇敵即降的人萬倍。但這十二個人的姓名，除了杜滸外，知者却少。現在把他們逐一叙述，雖不詳畫，或竟無事迹可見，但流芳百世，只一姓名亦够，事跡湮沒與否，本來不足輕重也。</p>
<p>這十二個人的姓名是：杜滸，金應，張慶，夏仲，呂武，王靑，鄒捷，余元慶，李茂，吳亮和蕭發。杜滸的姓名見於正史，略而不詳，但天祥「指南錄」詩序中記載他的事極多。天祥被擄得脫，倘使沒有他，簡直不會成爲事實。「文丞相督府忠義傳」所載，比較首尾完備，現在引在下面：</p>
<p>杜滸字貴卿，號梅　，天台人，游俠於臨安。及臨安危，糾合義兵四千人，當國者不省。二年正月十三日，見丞相西湖上，丞相獎異之。丞相使北營，滸力爭不可，陳志道逐之去。丞相北行，諸客莫敢從，滸慨然請行。丞相鎭江脫走，滸之力也。……及佐府南劍，遣往溫台招集兵財。福安陷，滸趨行朝，奉朝命歸行府。江西敗，又與跋涉危難者年餘。及　山潰，滸被執至廣州，貧病無人色，尋卒。</p>
<p>在十二人中，他是唯一智勇雙全的人！</p>
<p>金應姓名亦見正史，亦爲隨天祥使北而後同回的一人，「指南錄」有「哭金路分應」一詩序云：</p>
<p>金應以華札往來吾所二十年，性烈而知義，不爲下流。去年從予勤王，補兩武資。今春時，授承信郎，東南第六正將，贛州駐劄。……予之北行也，人情莫不觀望，僚從皆散，雖親僕亦逃去，惟應上下相隨，更歷險難，奔波數千里，以爲當然。蓋委身以從，死生休戚，俱爲一人者。至通州，住十餘日突，閩月五日，忽伏枕。——命　三四，熱病增劇（三六，一，二〇夜），至十一日午氣絕。予哭之痛。其歛也，以隨身衣服。其棺如常。翌日，葬西門雪窖邊。棺之上，排七小釘，又以一小板片覆於七釘之上，以爲記。不敢求備者，邊城無主，恐貽身後之禍。異時過便，取其骨歸葬廬陵，而後死者之目可閉也。傷哉！傷哉！</p>
<p>其人亦不下於杜滸，可惜於中途喪亡，使天祥失一好助手！</p>
<p>張慶官虞侯，亦見正史，其他事跡均不甚可考，僅「指南錄」「高沙道中」序由有云：</p>
<p>旦行霧中，不相辨，須　四山　明，忽　　見北騎。道有竹林，亟入避。須臾，二十餘騎　林呼噪，虞俟張慶右眼內中一箭，項二刀，割其醫，裸於地。……又「至高沙」後跋由有云：</p>
<p>予至高沙，奸細之　甚嚴。時予以　爲轎，見者憐之。又張慶血流滿面，衣衫皆污，人皆知爲遇北，不復以奸細疑。……</p>
<p>此後他是否跟天祥渡海，下文從此沒有提起，我們當然無從知道了。</p>
<p>夏仲是天祥的親隨。當天祥在高沙道中遇敵，他因散避得免，事亦見「高沙道中」序中。此外別無記載，大約因係一僕人，沒有別的功業，所以也沒有人注意他了。</p>
<p>呂武跟天祥逃脫時，官總轄，所以其事跡較爲可考。「文丞相督府忠義傳」中有他的傳，「文山集」卷十六「集杜詩」中「呂武第一百一十三」有序，所記較詳，茲據以錄八。序云：</p>
<p>環衛官呂武，太平人，面旗爲軍，余陷虜，應募隨從北行。其人勁烈，面責人，觸忌諱不避。然忠鯁，人皆服之。余與同脫鎭江，行淮東，患難中賴以自壯。及開府南劍，遺其結的江淮。道尋阻，武間關數千里，即余於汀梅。挺身寇寨，化賊爲兵。方將將數千人出江西，以無禮於士大夫，遭橫逆死。死之日，一軍爲流涕，哀哉！</p>
<p>王靑爲　兵，事跡亦無考。「高沙道中」序中有「　兵王靑縛去」一語，大的已爲元兵所殺。但即使生歸，也同夏仲一樣，因位微之故，人家也不注意他了。</p>
<p>鄒挺爲二僕夫，「指南錄」</p>
<p>「至揚州」第十六首序中有云：山下一里，有古廟。廟中有丐據居之。廟前有井，遂遺品武，鄒捷下山汲水，意或可以得米菜，少救飢餓。不料哨至，二人首被獲。二人解所腰白金近三百兩，悉以與之。北受金，得不殺。及哨過，二人方回，相向哀泣，又幸性命之苟全。</p>
<p>「高沙這中」序中有「僕夫鄒捷臥　　下，馬過，踏其足，流血」數語，此外亦無記載。</p>
<p>其餘四人，均在途中逃避。其時天祥徘徊眞揚之間，欲走通州，懼見捕，欲入楊州，恐被殺。正在行止未決之際，四人忽各帶所懷一百五十星逃走。四人即余元慶，李茂，吳亮與蕭　。事見「指南錄」「至揚州」第九第十兩首序中。四人中惟余元慶略有事跡可考，餘皆連身分也考查不出了。</p>
<p>元慶在天祥初逃時，頗多功勞，實亦一不可多得的人。「指南錄」「定計難」序中有云：</p>
<p>予在京城外，日夜謀脫不得間。……至平江，欲逃又不果。至鎭江，謀益急，議趨眞州，杜架閣與幔前將官余元慶實與謀。元慶，眞州人也。……</p>
<p>後來逃走時，覔得船隻渡江，元慶功最大。「得船難」序云：</p>
<p>北船滿江，百姓無一舟可問。杜架閣與人爲謀，皆以無船長歎而止。是後，余元慶遇其故舊，爲北管船，遂密叩之，許以承宜使，銀千兩。其人云：吾爲宋救得一丞相，回建大功業，何以錢爲？但求批帖爲他日趨承之證。……</p>
<p>此管船人亦不平凡，天祥卒賴之得渡。担將渡之時，不知何故，幾至失的，仍賴元慶不辭跋涉，終得如願。「候船難」序云：予先遺二校坐舟中，密約待予甘露寺下。及至，船不知所在，意窘甚。交謂船已失約奈何！予携匕首，不忍自殘，甚不得已，唯投水耳！</p>
<p>余元慶　裳涉水，尋一二里許，方得。船至，各稽首以更生爲賀。</p>
<p>照此看來，元慶却並不是一位吃不得苦的人，後來逃避，大的最大原因，在于天祥處於進退兩難之境，而又一時不決，他本是眞州人，家鄉在邇，所以一時失志，就回家去了。而且臨行之先，還曾爲天祥盡力。「至揚州」第七首序云：</p>
<p>予方未知進退，余元慶引一賣柴人至，云：相公有福！相公有福！問：能導至高沙吾？曰：能。曰：何處可暫避一日？曰儂家可。曰：此去幾里？曰二三十里。曰有哨否？曰：數日不一至。日：今日哨至如何？曰：看福如何耳！</p>
<p>元慶的所以能引到賣柴人，大約就因是在家鄕之故。然而後來大家始終不決，又不敢跟賣柴人去暫避，余元慶感到前途渺茫，當前又危臉萬分，所以竟不辭而行。其餘三人，或本與元慶同夥，或　州亦其家鄕，所以遂作一致行動，都不辭而行了。</p>
<p>有人說：余元慶等旣不願生死於前，何又畏之於後？但這等說法，只能用以　備有智識的士大夫。元慶是一武人，能够如此，已屬不易。換句話說，如果沒有他，天祥連長江也渡不過，何能逃脫？所以中途逃避，實也由於天祥當時處境，實不易使人信其必有希望之故。武人智短加之他或曾和同人起過齟齲，所以不能善始善終，竟以一走了事了。</p>

<p>「怎麼試呢？」小老虎問。</p>
<p>「那容易，」鶴見笑着，「耀小姐，岳大哥，都請坐遠些，」說着對耀羣和我點了點頭，又對小老虎說，「你就把我當作敵人，奪我送把手槍；」一邊說，一邊搯出了手槍，滴嗒一聲響，把子彈　退下了，放在口袋裏；這個動作，十分利索敏捷，　　只有一　眼時　。</p>
<p>小老虎不會客氣，立刻測量了一下地位，自巴退到這塊空地的角上，又叫鶴見站在對角；兩人距離大的三四碼遠近；</p>
<p>「您一舉槍，我就動手！」小老虎眼睛裏，又發出閃爍的奇光。</p>
<p>「行！」鶴見邊說邊把手槍一舉，姿勢迅速無比。誰知他剛抬手舉到地位的那一瞬，小老虎早一伏身，一個搶臂觔斗過去，一點聲息也沒有，迅疾的程度，無法形容。只見他，人一伏身，已經擦地過去，到了鶴見腳前。</p>
<p>鶴見柔道頗高，在軍隊裏學過奪槍這個手法，並且也有不少實地區騐；也算得挪，動作也輕捷無比。體知他雖快，小老虎比他更快，就在鶴見移動身形的時候，避開了槍口，就地一個反旋子，人已到了鶴見背後；說也不信，就在一晃眼之間，小老虎的左手已經插在鶴見左邊脅下，托住了他的手肘，右手順着鶴見的右臂，把鶴見的手槍，連搶連手握住，提起向懷裏輕輕一帶，鶴見的右臂，一時拗住了筋，不能用力，眉尖一縐，似乎感到一陣疲痛似的，只好放手；那枝手槍，早到了小老虎手裏了。這是一種擒拿的變化手法，如若對方執拗，不肯放下手中器械，手臂就有折斷的可能。</p>
<p>「佩服，佩服。」鶴見頭額上已見了汗珠了。</p>
<p>「不！」小老虎　開嘴笑着，「這是好玩兒哪，要是幹眞的，您只要一挪步，我早給您一腿撩的爬下去哪。」</p>
<p>「怎麼說？」鶴見正式叨教了。</p>
<p>「偌」小老虎把鶴見送到原站的地位上，「我　到這裏，您躍起向這邊一讓，偌，」小老虎把一雙左腿插到　見　裏，輕輕向右一踢一撩。就這廢比劃着演習，鶴見的左腿已經懸起，身體覺得一晃蕩，也向右邊頭了兩步，幸虧小老虎牽住了他的左臂，才站穩了　子。</p>
<p>「嗐」！鶴見一而拭着汗珠，一面驚歎着，「我這柔道竟是白練了的呢！誰想中國拳技，竟是這樣變化無窮。」</p>
<p>「您還沒想到虎弟手上的功夫哩。」耀羣坐在靠窗的椅十上笑着說，「我想要是遇見眞的敵人，怕他不見得這們文明哪。」</p>
<p>「確然，確然！」鶴見很誠懇地承認了，「我應該拜師了。」說着，也退到一張椅十上坐下了。又對小老虎笑着，「小老師，您請坐。」鶴見拍着自已身邊的一張椅子。</p>
<p>「您二位剛從醫院來？」我插口換了一個題目，「吳先生快能起坐了，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「我同虎弟是兩點多鐘去的，吳先生已經下床了，精神似乎還好，可就是憂得厲害。一瞧見我們，盡淌眼淚；眞叫人看着難受。我安慰了他幾句，勸他想開此。可是我又不知道應該說些什麼。本來麼，好好一家六七口，活鮮鮮的人；太太，大小姐，二小姐，三小姐小丁香，還有兩個活活潑潑的男孩子，就這們不明不白地，給那羣土匪鬼子們，殺得一個不留，還能呌他不傷心嗎？」</p>

<h3>和平之城：紐約「唐人街」</h3>
<p>— 武雄譯自「紐約時報週刋」</p>
<p>讀本月四日申報駐美特派員手樹濟先生報導舊金山唐人街，　譯紐約時報週刋一文，以製讀者。</p>
<p>假如你這幾天到紐約「中國城」（即唐人街）去走走，你決不會懷疑到，現在中國在進行着內戰，沒胡再比這五條彎曲的街道，更讓緊張的神經得以安靜的了。六千個中國人和平而隱居似地在那裏住着。在這些餐館，理髮店，古玩鋪和老舊的住房中，沒有國共衝突的糾紛，由國政局在這裏的反響，有如揚子江上七月的微風。</p>
<p>一個特點勤勞</p>
<p>中國城有五家中國文的報紙，一家是共產黨的。老年人也看看要聞版，可是他們更大的興趣，是裏頁的本市新聞。在副刋上有：誰家理發館的老板娶了親，誰家衣館主人寫了一首詩；和從小型報上翻譯的紐約犯罪的新聞。他們很少有政治的熱情，他們有一個特點—勤勞；一個愛好—「錢」；—一個信念「忠於家族」。</p>
<p>中國城對於那些勇敢地云觀光的人，仍然給一些假的印象。一羣一羣的中國人彼此小聲談話，靠著住屋的墻，或者俯在半明不暗的茶館裏的桌子上，好像是在「計劃革命」，事實上，他們却在聊天。</p>
<p>安居樂業</p>
<p>雖然去觀光的人，有很多幻想可是事實上中國城是紐約最和平的區域，第五警察區的犯罪名單中，盡是些西洋人。中國城以外幾候街的地方，就是許多計飯的人，和在暗淡的陰影中對罵，而且甚至於互相動起武來。</p>
<p>相反地，在中國城內，所有乞丐和醉漢都是些不長進的西洋人，他們到這裏來向遊客要錢，並且在幾家酒吧間裏飲酒。在過去八年中，中國城中只有一個人因醉酒而被捕的，殺人或犯其他較重罪刑的，沒胡一位。至於雅片，又貴，質料又壞，現在已經沒有人問津了。</p>
<p>很少紐約人知道中國城究有多大。對於大紐約城其他區域的人，總以為中國城是遊客值得參觀，可以用筷子吃飯的一個大地方。事實上約六千的居民只住在小小的五條街內。</p>
<p>中國城也是大紐約四萬八千東方人的精神家園。這些東方人一到傍晚或星期日就都齊聚在中國城，來談天，來理發，來看親友，當幾個大家族宴會之日，旗子在街前飛舞着，姓楊的，姓李的；從費城，從波士頓，或者從西岸趕來參加盛會。</p>
<p>男人世界</p>
<p>中國城的第一個中國人是在一八六七年從大埠來的，他在皮爾路十三號開了一個古玩會舖，以後，從加拿大，古巴，墨西哥和中國來了許多中國人，有一件奇異的事實，就是：這裏的居民雖然大多由家庭關係組成，但男女之比為八比一。大多數的已婚男子把他們的妻子丟在中國。而且明顯地，並不想什麽桶救方法。中國城是一個奇怪的男人的世界。</p>
<p>中國城有很多敎堂，有時一條街上就有三家，但參加的人並不多。星期日，天主敎堂很熱鬧，但盡是鄰近的意大利人，去年冬天，田主敎新從中國來到中國城講道，參加的不過五十人而已。</p>
<p>有一個家老的意大利理髮館，作中國人的生意已四十餘年。不久以前，一位中國報館的編輯，一方而在中國大學讀書的，理髮的時候和理髮師攀談起來。那理髮師說：「我在中國需四十年，你是第一個回答我的中國人。」</p>
<p>東方精神　清淡幽閒</p>
<p>中國城的中國人，好像仍保持享受他們消閒的東方藝術。他們不狂熱去追求　樂。他們　窮盡地談談家庭的事情，商業問題和中國女人。少數女人在中國需當然很受重視，但也不過只是談談而已。無論中西的女人從中國城走過，決不會被人吹口笛，或被人調笑的。</p>
<p>中國城人們的祖先，是有雄心的，是中國冒險家，商人和水手。他們離開家園，到國外去作拓荒者，現在中國城的中國人却過着與人無爭而不動感情的生活，而且對中國社會的習慣循規蹈矩。</p>
<p>父母仍根據舊習慣管敎子女，他們常常告訴兒女們：「在美國出生的孩子是沒腦筋的「年青人說話太多了」。在戰時，中國青年很多參加軍隊，但平時，他們很少遠行的，他們酷愛讀書，可是很少入大學。</p>
<p>中國城的唯一法庭是密街十六號頂樓的中華女子協會。中國人從來不到紐約市的法庭去。</p>
<p>中國城不完全是中國化，也不完全是美國化。在這幾條街之內，一種文化正在衰落，而另一種文化又還沒有建立起來。老年人還用舊法子來生活的，並且讓他們的妻子在樓上不見人。他們只讀中國報和中國刋物，可是他們的兒子們却也不會說中國話，不會讀中文，密願讀紐約的小型英文報。</p>
<p>他們是驕傲的　他們是誠實的</p>
<p>在老年人中，沒有東方的哲人，在青年人中，也沒有政治領導者而且也只有少數真正的學生。所以有些人在一個傳統的氣氛中生活，却缺乏了新的創造的力量，但是他們是驕傲的，他們是誠實的，而且當他們晚上站着談話的時候，他們常常有一種冷淡的表情，好像他帶有三千年古文化的倦意似的。</p>

<p>影若干日前，本市各英文報都登着一則怪廣告，既無刋登人的姓名或公司，亦不說名目的或用意，只說是招請幾位外籍美女，却將每一位的身材尺寸體重幾磅等等條件開列得極其祥細。讀者多不明其真意何在，一經探詢，原來是美國哥倫比亞影片公司來滬攝外景。</p>
<p>哥倫比亞是好萊塢八大製片商之一，這次攝一張關於國際販毒巨案的影片「盜庫銀」，中聞有一部份背景是上海，於是該片導演納柴羅一反過去好萊塢「閉門造車」的作風，認真地趕到上海來拍外景。然而因為路途遙遠，嬌美的女主角不便　涉重洋，所以登報徴求替身。</p>
<p>非但女主角準備在上海找替身，連攝影師也在這里聘定了人，是王小亭，王是米高梅公司的駐華新聞片攝影師。記得當敵寇當年轟炸上海時，王小亭在北站攝得一段新聞片，那情景是車站剛遭聶炸，滿目斷垻殘壁鐵道上　地坐着一個週歲的孩子，衣衫破爛，渾身灼傷，張口大聲號哭，四圍是死一樣的靜寂。</p>
<p>僅僅這一張照片，換得了各國人民道議上的同情與聲援，日寇殘殺無辜濫施轟炸的不人道行為在國際間留下了深刻的印象。</p>
<p>直到最近還有一本雜誌讚美它是近十年中最佳新聞攝影之一。新片「飛虎忠魂」中有一個大轟炸後的特寫鏡頭，背景與那嬰兒的　情，全與上術類同，自是受了那張新聞照片的影響</p>
<h3>徴婚消息　宣傳而已</h3>
<p>— 范石人</p>
<p>劇最近有人給「平劇亞後后」曹　麟登了一則徴婚消息，果然有不少平日醉心她的人，寫信去應徵。其實這段徴婚消息這不過是她和寫稿者互開玩笑，並藉此做做「宣傳」而已。</p>
<p>由後方來的姊妹坤佁李薔華，和李薇華，會在大舞台唱了一個時期，以後就沒有機會搭班，但社交塲所却不時有她們的芳蹤，因此有人稱她們為「交際坤伶」。</p>
<p>某夜在天蟾舞台觀程硯秋演梅妃，金殿一塲，布景上滿裝電燈泡，顯似演「貍貓搖太子」，此種「噱頭」既陳腐又低級，且不合　劇體裁，風格上與京朝氣派不很調和。</p>
<h3>玄妙之草</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>聞於靈之章的傳說</p>
<p>靈之助學議展，轟動　　，慕名遠道參觀者頗不乏人，愛作小考，以供助談。</p>
<p>論衡云「芝生於土，土氣和，故芝生土，食之令人眉壽，有青雲芝，龍仙芝，金鬧芝，九曲芝，火芝，月精芝，夜光芝，發火芝，白雲芝，雲母芝，鳳腦芝，五德芝，萬年芝。」</p>
<p>木草五芝經云：「青芝生泰山，赤芝生霍山，黃芝生嵩山，白芝生華山，黑芝生常山，紫芝生高夏山谷，六芝皆六月八日采。」</p>
<p>嫏嬛記云：「靈芝一名壽　，一名希夷。」說文云：「芝神草也」。</p>
<p>抱朴子云：「芝有數百種。」其他如蘭陽雜俎及采芝闊等各籍，皆有戰之，但各有其說，從略。</p>
<p>漢明帝水平十七年春，芝生前殿。唐天寶七戰三月，大同殿柱產玉芝，有神光照殿，軍巨請加皇帝尊號，開元天寶聖文神武應道。肅宗上元二年七月，延英殿御座樑上生玉芝，一莖三花。宋史五行志載：「太平開國五年九月，真定府行宮殿樑生芝如荷花。咸平四年正月，濰州獻芝草一本，如佛狀。大由祥符元年五月辛未，於孔林得芝五株，色黃紫如雲色，及人載冠冕之狀。」諸如此類，不勝轉綠。</p>
<p>博物志云：「名山生神芝不死之草，上芝為車馬，中芝為人形，下芝為六畜」。</p>
<p>關於靈芝文獻，有唐崔融皇太子賀芝草表，宋秦觀俞紫芝字序，宋王安石芝閣記，黃庭堅瑞芝亭記，吉州峯院王秀亭記等。</p>
<p>宋蘇軾與鞠詩正尺儥云：「文登雖稍　，百事可業，島中出一藥名白石芝者，香味初者嚼茶，久之甚美，聞甚益人，不可不白公知也，白石滎狀如石耳，而有香味，惟此為辨，秘之秘之。」</p>
<p>據居山雜志載：「吳縣金山雅多靈芝，時產地上，多碧色，山人每采得之，弗貴也。」</p>
<p>總上小考，靈芝雖為瑞草，歷年有產，良以產於深山，罕有被人發現，至於傳說「服之成仙」，俱為神話，不足取信，至於是否可作藥物上之用，則有待醫學家之研究。</p>

<h3>The National Army Is Only Nine Miles from Linyi; The Communist Army Attacking Laiwu Has Already Been Defeated; Liu Bocheng's Attempt to Flee to Eastern Henan Has Been Thwarted</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 7th] The National Army's advance on Linyi has reached a point nine miles from the city. It is currently difficult to predict whether the Communist army will make a stand with their backs to the city. In the central Shandong province, the National Army under Wang Yaowu near Laiwu is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist army. The National Army occupied the city on the 4th of this month, and the Communist army immediately launched a counterattack the following day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 7th] Chen Yi's troops of the Communist army in southern Shandong are now disintegrating. Some advocate defending Linyi, some want to flee, and others wish to surrender. Among them, the Second, Third, Seventh, and New Sixth Divisions, which advocate fleeing, began independent actions on the evening of the 6th, harassing southeast of Tancheng. In the area of Suanzhuang Lake and Daxinji, north of Baitapu on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, they have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hao Pengju's troops. The fighting had not subsided as of the afternoon of the 7th. The National Army north of Tancheng, in order to support Hao's troops, also advanced north towards Linyi in three routes on the morning of the 7th, engaging in fierce battles with the faction of Chen Yi's troops advocating defense. At the same time, Xue Yue, Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, wrote a letter to Communist army officers and soldiers, which was distributed by the air force on the morning of the 7th, encouraging the faction of Chen Yi's troops that advocate surrender to quickly surrender to the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 7th] As the National Army presses towards Linyi, the morale of the Communist army in southern Shandong is wavering. It is reported that important military and political institutions have been relocated to Dadian, about ninety miles north of Linyi. The price of the fake Beihai currency in the Communist area is falling sharply, and the people are throwing away the fake money and secretly hoarding legal tender.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 7th] The Nationalist and Communist armies are still fighting near Caojiazhuang, 14 kilometers south of Laiwu today. In addition to dispatching a part of its forces to clear out scattered Communist troops around Laiwu, the National Army is also rushing to repair the highway between Boshan and Laiwu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] The National Army in central Shandong has made progress. The Communist army attacking Laiwu has been repelled. The National Army took advantage of the victory to advance south, reaching Yanzhuang, Caojiazhuang, Yangshan, and surrounding areas 14 kilometers south of the city on the evening of the 5th, where fighting continues.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] Liu Bocheng's troops, consisting of twelve regiments totaling over 20,000 men, crossed south of the Longhai Railway a week ago and dispersed to Lüling, Tuocheng, Luyi, and Haoxian areas. After continuous tracking and interception by the National Army for several days, they were completely routed by the 6th. Currently, the National Army in eastern Henan is strengthening pacification efforts. Liu Bocheng's eight regiments in western Shandong, totaling over 15,000 men, fiercely attacked Liuhe Xiaoba and the area 20 miles northwest of Shangqiu on the 4th. The garrison forces resolutely blocked them with flanking maneuvers from both wings, resulting in fierce fighting for two days and nights. Two-thirds of the Communist army was annihilated. Liu Bocheng's six columns have now lost four, and his plan to flee to eastern Henan has been completely thwarted.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 7th] A brigade of Liu Bocheng's troops has newly arrived northwest of Shangqiu, and the National Army is increasing reinforcements. A major battle between Henan and Anhui is about to break out.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 7th] There is peace and quiet in Jiaodong with no fighting. Communist army movements are busy around Jinan. On the 5th and 6th, two to three thousand Communist troops moved south from Yucheng, attempting to attack Qihe, but were all repelled by the National Army.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of U.S. Personnel from the Military Mediation Department Return Home by Ship</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 7th] After the U.S. statement of withdrawing from the Military Mediation Department, over 300 U.S. personnel and their families left Ping by special train for Tanggu on the 7th, and will return home by ship. This is the first batch to withdraw.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 7th] The U.S. personnel from the Military Mediation Department were ordered by the State Department to withdraw. The first batch of 303 people, aboard seven specially prepared train cars, arrived safely in Tanggu at 1:35 PM, without any accidents, except for a one-hour delay outside Beiping due to a damaged locomotive. Upon arriving in Tanggu, they immediately transferred to the transport ship General Weigel, which is expected to set sail within 24 hours.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Changchun Branch Ends; Liaison Office to China to Be Established</h3>
<p>Withdraws After Work Is Completed</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] Colonel Tyson, the U.S. representative of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun branch, recently notified both the government and the Chinese Communist Party in writing that the U.S. work officially ends from today. A Changchun branch of the U.S. Army Headquarters' Liaison Office to China will be established to carry out unfinished tasks before the withdrawal. Once transportation matters within the Northeast region of the department are completed and work is finished, it will withdraw. The government and the Chinese Communist Party at the Changchun branch will remain as usual.</p>
<h3>Personnel of Various Groups in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Concentrate in Changchun and Shenyang to Await Orders for Withdrawal</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] Government and U.S. personnel from various groups in the Northeast of the Military Mediation Department have gradually concentrated in Changchun and Shenyang. The Anshan 30th Group withdrew to Shenyang on the 5th and awaits orders for withdrawal with the Shenyang 27th Group. The Hailong 29th Group and the Dehui 34th Group also withdrew to Changchun on the 5th and 6th respectively. The Siping 28th Group will also return to Changchun within a day or two. As for the Chinese Communist Party personnel of the above five groups, they withdrew to Harbin, Qiqihar, and other places on December 20th of last year.</p>
<h3>Personnel of the Three Parties in Changchun; Communist Party Personnel Withdraw First</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] A spokesman for the government side of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun branch recently told reporters: The process for the withdrawal of the three parties of the Military Mediation Department's Changchun branch may involve the Communist Party personnel withdrawing first. The U.S. side has agreed to provide two planes to send them to Harbin. After the Communist Party personnel withdraw, the U.S. side will begin to withdraw via both land and air through Shenyang to Beiping. Government personnel, except for some who will go to Ping by plane, will travel by train. It is reported that arrangements have been made with the local transportation authorities to prepare two special trains for transportation.</p>
<h3>The Military Mediation Department's Special Group Discusses Sending Liaison Officers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] The last special group of the Military Mediation Department held a meeting at 4 PM this afternoon. U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Ye Ci, Government Colonel Liu Tielun, and Communist Party Lieutenant Colonel Long Yinglin attended. They discussed sending liaison officers from both sides to their original areas and unfinished matters. Major General Zhou Beifeng (Director of the Suiyuan Political Bureau), the liaison officer of the 12th War Zone who has been released, also attended the meeting to thank the group for its efforts to restore their freedom. Today, a reporter interviewed Zhou, who said: (1) On August 21st, he was ordered by Commander Fu to go to Jining to persuade the Communist army to stop attacking Datong, but to no avail. Later, the war escalated, and he was taken to Zuoyun by the Communist army. Initially, the Military Mediation Department sent a special group to Datong to handle the exchange of liaison officers several times, but the determined exchange dates were never successful. He was then sent to Yan'an, and only yesterday morning at 10 AM was he notified that he might be released and returned to Ping by plane in the afternoon. (2) The Yan'an side seems to believe that continuing to fight could change the situation in their favor. They have great expectations for the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The Jiefang Daily has never published the news of the U.S. withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department and the withdrawal of Communist Party personnel, only articles criticizing the U.S. withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department. After living through a forced march of three thousand miles (and four months as a prisoner), Zhou's temples have turned gray. He will stay here briefly and then go to Zhangjiakou to meet Commander Fu and report everything.</p>
<h3>The Government and the Chinese Communist Party Exchange Liaison Officers</h3>
<p>Zhou Beifeng Released from Yan'an and Returns to Ping</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Huang Hua, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Military Mediation Department, returned to Ping from Yan'an this afternoon, and Major General Zhou Beifeng, the liaison officer of the 12th War Zone, was also released and returned to Ping. Zhou was the liaison officer stationed in Jining by Commander Fu. During the Jining campaign, the Communist army exchanged Zhou for their retreat. Later, the Military Mediation Department formed a special group to go to Daming to handle the exchange of liaison officers between the 12th War Zone and the Communist Party (the Communist Party also had liaison officers in Guisui), but all efforts failed. Recently, as the Military Mediation Department was being dissolved and Chinese Communist Party personnel were about to withdraw to Yan'an, the government side requested again that the Chinese Communist Party release Zhou. Today, the Military Mediation Department sent the last special group to the Xijiao Airport to handle the exchange of liaison officers from both sides. This afternoon, Huang Hua accompanied Zhou Beifeng and three other government personnel from Yan'an, and the Datong special group also accompanied Yuan Jian and five other Chinese Communist Party liaison officers from Datong, and the exchange was immediately carried out.</p>
<h3>Ye Jianying and Xue Zizheng Hold a Cocktail Party</h3>

<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] Ye Jianying, a Chinese Communist Party member of the Military Mediation Department, and Xue Zizheng, Chief of Staff, held a cocktail party at the Beijing Hotel tonight to bid farewell to various circles in Beiping. Government officials led by Director Li of the Xingyuan, presidents of various universities, people from the MinShe Party and the China Democratic League, and senior U.S. military officers were all invited to attend.</p>
<h3>General Zheng Dongguo</h3>
<p>Gives a Farewell Party for Personnel of the Three Parties</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] General Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Command, ordered on the 7th, in his personal name, the invitation of more than 30 personnel from the three parties of the Military Mediation Department to a reception at the Changchun branch of the Lizhi Society to bid them farewell.</p>
<h3>The Nanjing and Shanghai Delegations of the Chinese Communist Party Wish to Continue to Reside in Their Original Places</h3>
<p>In Order to Maintain Liaison Between the Government and the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Chen Jiakang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Communist Party, told reporters yesterday: Whether the Chinese Communist Party delegation will withdraw before March 5th is pending instructions from Yan'an. However, if the government does not refuse the Chinese Communist Party personnel to reside, the Chinese Communist Party delegation is willing to continue to fulfill its responsibility of maintaining liaison between the government and the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Also Denies the Rumor of He Yingqin's Return to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the news report that General He Yingqin, who is currently in the United States attending the Military Staff Conference, has been ordered to return to China, our reporter inquired with relevant government departments. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded that this news is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>The Proposal Committee of the Third Plenary Session Is Dividing Into Four Groups to Conduct Thorough Research and Discussion, So That It Can Focus on Discussion at the Congress</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Third Plenary Session is scheduled to open on March 15th. In order to concentrate opinions within the party and thoroughly study the proposals, the Central Standing Committee decided to establish a proposal committee, divided into four groups: party affairs, politics, economics, and constitutional government. Each Standing Committee member will designate themselves to one or two groups. The groups will hold separate meetings starting on the 6th and invite central committee members and party cadres in Nanjing to participate in the research. It is learned that there are not many proposals for this session. Each group will concentrate the views of various central committee members and summarize one or two proposals to facilitate focused discussion. In addition, this session will focus on discussing party affairs and political reform plans.</p>
<h3>The Northern Hebei National Army Launches a Counterattack; The Communist Army Attacking Laishui Retreats Southwest; Strong National Army Units Arrive in Baoding</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 7th] The Northern Hebei National Army launched a full-scale counterattack. Nie Rongzhen's troops of over 20,000 men, who fiercely attacked Laishui for days, retreated to the southwest yesterday. The National Army in the Laishui area has entered Yixian County, and Yixian City can be recovered within days. The National Army between Caohe and Zhuoxian is also sweeping the area 20 miles on both sides. The National Army reinforcements arrived in Baoding on the evening of the 6th, immediately stabilizing the morale of the people. The next action is in preparation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Fierce fighting is taking place north of Baoding. Military sources say that the two Communist armies have been attacking since the 4th in Laishui, Yixian, Wen Dunsizi Mountain, and outside Xushui. After days of fierce fighting, the Communist army has not gained an advantage, and the National Army is gradually taking the initiative. Chen Jicheng, Deputy Commander of the 11th War Zone, went to Zhuoxian Dingxing front today to inspect the military situation with Mou Tingfang, and returned to Ping that day. Mou is still staying in Zhuoxian, and Xushui Gucheng is tense. The National Army's fortifications outside Baoding are very strong, ensuring no worry. He Long's sister, He Feng, is now near Baoding. In addition to commanding two cavalry units, she is also responsible for training Communist Party female spies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Baoding, 7th. The military authorities of Hebei Province have recently implemented effective emergency measures in response to the current situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The National Army has begun large-scale deployments to make planned new arrangements to ensure the safety of Pingbao traffic and consolidate the defenses of Baoding. The National Army's strength in Dingxing has been strengthened so that the troops stationed along the Pingbao route can coordinate with Baoding from north and south to crush the Communist army's harassment attempts. Therefore, military transportation between Pingbao has been busy in recent days. In addition, strong National Army units heading south along the Pinghan Railway have arrived in Xushui and are waiting for orders to cross Baoding and head south.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] There are minor skirmishes outside Shijiazhuang. Communist army forces frequently harass southwest of Yuanshi. Around Nanbeiyaocheng northwest of Zhengding, six regiments of the Communist army frequently attack the National Army outposts outside Zhengding. Yaocheng County is southwest of Gangshan, and there were battles the day before yesterday, with Xima briefly falling. The city of Shijiazhuang is stable. The military has requested the Pinghan Railway Bureau to actively repair the city's railway to secure Shijiazhuang, which can be completed within two weeks. The Communist army's attention has shifted to cutting off the Zhengtai Railway to isolate Shijiazhuang from Taiyuan. Military sources say that the current Communist army force is not enough to attack Shijiazhuang. The Communist army on the west side of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is mobilizing hundreds of carts to transport materials and food to the mountains on both sides and is actively engaging in air defense activities.</p>
<h3>Five-Year Plan for Material Construction</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Five-Year Plan for Material Construction has been drafted by relevant parties in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the Chairman's instructions. The total capital will reach 22 billion (calculated at pre-war currency value), with the government, the people, and foreign capital each contributing one-third. Among them, transportation will account for 38 percent, industry 27 percent, infrastructure 11 percent, power 10 percent, water conservancy 9 percent, and agriculture 5 percent.</p>

Gu also conveyed Chairman Chiang's condolences to the compatriots in the pacification area. Gu will go to Tianjin on the 9th.</p>
<h3>The Government Raises Import Tariffs; The U.S. Will Express Opposition; American Businesses Urge the U.S. Government to Stop It</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Chinese Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen is scheduled to raise import tariffs starting on the 6th of this month. The U.S. State Department and the Department of Commerce stated today that they will oppose it. It is said that this matter has not yet been confirmed by their representatives in China, and action cannot be decided until the report is received, but it is believed that this move is enough to harm American commerce in China. When reporters asked the authorities for their opinions, it was said that this could devalue Chinese legal tender, which will ultimately be unavoidable.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] American businesses in China are worried about the increasing control of industry and commerce by the Chinese government, believing that it threatens the position of American businessmen in the Far East. Hundreds of American businesses with branches in China or seeking to establish branches are urging the American government to stop the wave of government monopolies of the market, saying that this move would eliminate private enterprises. The initiators of this movement are the National Foreign Trade Council and the American Chamber of Commerce in China, both of which are based in New York and composed of American businesses engaged in Far East trade. Other American trade organizations, such as the American Chamber of Commerce, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, have not joined, but are equally concerned about maintaining and expanding American trade in China. The State Department and the Department of Commerce are also sympathetic to the business community's request for government support to expand postwar Far East trade. The Export-Import Bank is the same, and its main task is to assist American international trade. A lengthy memorandum from the two New York chambers of commerce to the State Department outlined the increasing dominance of government-run industries in China and stated that the government should take remedial measures on behalf of American interests. The State Department said it has been negotiating with the Nanjing government for months to resolve the difficulties encountered by American trade and investment in China.</p>
<h3>Villages Around Datong Are Repeatedly Harassed by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Cooperative News Agency, Beiping, 7th] A U.S. military officer who returned here from Datong today told the United Press that villages around Datong are repeatedly harassed by the Communist army, and fighting continues intermittently, causing considerable damage to houses. He saw some Japanese technicians in Datong wearing old Japanese military uniforms. Also, according to a U.S. officer who returned to Ping from Taiyuan, there are still a large number of Japanese soldiers in the Taiyuan area, either wearing Japanese military uniforms or Chinese clothes.</p>
<h3>The Chahar Administrative Meeting Opens; Chairman Chuan Announces Ten Major Programs; A Mongolian Banner Cultural Welfare Committee Is Established</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] A Zhangjiakou telephone message states that the first full provincial administrative meeting in Chahar after the recovery of the province opened at 9 AM this morning. Chairman Chuan presided over it in person. Attendees included commissioners, county magistrates, section chiefs, and Mongolian Banner representatives, totaling more than 800 people. The meeting is scheduled for ten days. In his opening speech, Chairman Chuan revealed the ten major programs for Chahar Province in the future: (1) Complete local autonomy and implement democratic politics; (2) Stabilize society and ensure public security; (3) Implement a 25% rent reduction; (4) Increase farmland; (5) Protect transportation and balance prices; (6) Restore schools at all levels; (7) Improve health facilities; (8) Reorganize finance and reduce the burden; (9) Improve the welfare of Mongolian compatriots; (10) Implement omnipotent politics.

<h3>A Batch of Communist Army Enters Dalian City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] It is reported that on the 1st and 2nd, three military ships of a certain country arrived at Dalian Wharf, and 1,500 Communist army soldiers with equipped vehicles landed and entered the city. In addition, a certain national army in Jinzhou is actively constructing ground fortifications and other defensive works. At a time when the reception of Dalian is being hyped up, its future development is indeed noteworthy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] It is learned that the Communist army has now changed the Dalian Municipal Government into the Lüda Jin Joint Office, which is a measure that has attracted much attention.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] Passenger trains from Shihe south to Datong are now open. In addition, the Jinzhou Chengzipo Railway now runs from Jinzhou to Dengshahe, which is one hundred miles away from Jinzhou, but because it is only used by the Soviet army to transport materials, the people are not allowed to use it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] Soviet troops are stationed at Yuzidian, about thirty miles southwest of Biz窝, because the area is outside the Lushun naval base area, and we have urged them to pay attention.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 7th] For more than two months after the national army stationed in Yuzidian, the outer periphery of Dalian, no formal administrative personnel have been sent. Helplessly, the stationed troops ordered the local area to establish a maintenance committee. However, the leading members of the maintenance committee are Japanese accomplices such as senior criminals and special agents, Wang Letian, Shi Tingya, etc. In the past, they arbitrarily accused people of being anti-Manchu and resisting Japan. Today, they falsely accuse people of being the Eighth Route Army and spies, deceiving the stationed troops and harming 200,000 civilians. The people have specially written to Du Yuming and Chairman Xu Zhen, appealing to be rescued from the water and fire.</p>
<h3>The China Chang Railway Establishes the Dalian Management Office</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 7th] The Dalian Management Office of the China Chang Railway will be formally established in Wafangdian within days.

The Dalian Management Office is the southernmost section of the China Chang Railway, in charge of the 240-kilometer railway administration between Dalian and Dashiqiao.</p>
<h3>Nantong Datongzhen Recaptured</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 7th] Military News: Datong Town, Sanyu District, Nantong, has long been occupied by the Communist army, and the people have suffered greatly. On the evening of the 28th of last month, the Communist army gathered in the town again and carried out massacres. The situation was very tragic. Dozens of people were killed in the Tongxing Township area of Henan. Upon hearing this, the Tong Rudong Qingjiao District of the First Pacification Zone immediately cooperated with the Self-Defense Forces and rushed to the scene, recapturing the town and capturing its leaders, seven people. Fifty people, including the head of the political and transportation station, automatically laid down their guns and surrendered. Currently, the refugees who fled are returning to their hometowns one after another.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Howard Newspaper System Opposes Interference in China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 6th] The Howard newspaper system today wrote a commentary criticizing Democratic Congressman Mansfield's Pacific report as "admirable," but its suggestion that the four powers jointly resolve China's domestic situation must be criticized, saying, "This suggestion is bound to backfire, because China is an independent country."</p>
<h3>The Letter from the MinShe Party to the Chairman; The Wording Is Much Softer Than the Original Opinion Paper; The Letter Was Taken to Nanjing by Lei Zhen Last Night</h3>
<p>[Our News] Confirmed News: The requirements and wording in the letter that Zhang Junmai entrusted Lei Zhen to take to the Chairman are much softer than the original opinion paper. The most obvious point is that the original opinion paper required that the position of Executive Yuan President be held by a person outside the party. After Lei Zhen repeatedly explained, the MinShe Party personnel considered administrative experience and practical issues, and finally decided to cancel this requirement. The Central Government's intentions for reorganizing the government are very sincere, and the central and local governments can be fully considered when implementing the reorganization in the future. Currently, the MinShe Party is carrying out preparatory work. Zhang Junmai will go to Nanjing next week to meet with the Chairman to discuss practical issues. If there are no unexpected changes in the reorganization of the government, it is expected to be completed in mid-March.</p>
<p>[Our News] Lei Zhen took the night train to Nanjing at 11 PM last night, and his activities before his departure were quite busy. At noon, he gathered many important members of the MinShe Party at the International Hotel for a final consultation before going to Beijing. At 5 PM, he visited Director Wu Wenguan, who came to Shanghai, and gave a detailed report on the process of the contact in Shanghai. According to Lei, there is not a great distance between the government and the MinShe Party, and the various conditions rumored outside may not be true. Zhang Junmai could not go to Beijing with him due to some affairs. In his letter to Chairman Chiang, he explained the reasons and difficulties for the MinShe Party's delayed submission of opinions on the reorganization of the government, but it is not necessarily a requirement for the government to respond. According to his personal observation, the government reorganization can be realized in the short term. In addition to the MinShe Party and the Youth Party, social leaders will be individually invited to participate by the government.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Discusses the Current Situation: The Government is Determined Not to Resolve the Communist Issue Militarily; Government Reorganization Can Be Implemented Within Weeks</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 7th] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, recently gave a speech to our reporter, discussing the French-Vietnamese conflict, the domestic situation, and the US policy towards Japan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Conflict in Vietnam</p>
<p>If the conflict in Vietnam is brought before the United Nations, China should support any reasonable demands of the Viet Minh Republic. At the same time, if the conflict in Vietnam develops to a point where it endangers China's interests, then we will have to consider the situation and adopt a new attitude. If France attempts to conquer Vietnam by force, it will be seen as an imperialist country causing resentment among all Asian countries, including China. This will result in some Chinese people crossing the Sino-Vietnamese border and fighting alongside the Viet Minh forces. However, the report that the Chinese government plans to organize an expeditionary force to fight in Vietnam is not true. China's recognition of the Viet Minh government depends on the future development of the situation. Furthermore, such recognition could strain Sino-French relations, which we should avoid. Current Sino-French relations are very cordial, with no serious disputes. As of now, China has not participated in any side of the conflict in Vietnam, so this issue is unrelated to China. However, when the Viet Minh government is capable of [conducting] diplomacy, we will welcome any proposals from the Viet Minh to establish relations with us.</p>
<p>Regarding the domestic situation, the Shandong campaign is ongoing and will have a decisive impact on the country's future. The government is forced to take military measures to deal with the Communist military attacks. The government is prepared and willing to resume peace talks at any time, but military action is the only way to change the Communist attitude. The government sincerely hopes that the Communists will take a reasonable path, but if they do not, then the war will continue as long as they resist by force. The Communist army attacked the government army because they have too much faith in their own military power, but the Communist army cannot occupy Xuzhou according to plan and are now preparing to retreat from Linyi. The war situation is gradually turning against them, but the government is determined not to [follow] suit by using military methods to solve the Communist problem. As for the reorganization of the government, it may be implemented within the next few weeks. The government is recruiting various parties to share the responsibility of the government. General Marshall's statement acknowledged the failure of American mediation but strengthened the government's desire to accelerate the implementation of the constitution. The withdrawal of the United States from the Three-Man Executive Headquarters and the Military Mediation Department was dictated by the situation. The Chinese question must be solved by the Chinese themselves. Marshall was just a mediator. He is an American, with a great power behind him, so his mediation work seemed too much like foreign intervention. If Marshall were a citizen of a small country like Switzerland, the situation would be different.</p>
<p>Moscow Conference</p>
<p>When asked about the possibility of the Moscow Conference discussing the Chinese question, Sun said: I do not know how the Moscow Conference can involve China. It must be known that any external interference is enough to arouse the indignation of our people. Marshall's failure is a lesson learned.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese question, the current policy of the United States is wrong. MacArthur seems to rely too much on reactionary elements to achieve his goals.</p>
<p>The Japanese ruling class is covering up for a comeback and is trying to make MacArthur believe that Japan is democratic and no longer has military ambitions. China has suffered the most from Japanese aggression and is very concerned about the development of the situation in that country, fearing that Japan's expansionist policy will be revived. The Japanese question is linked to the current US-Soviet confrontation. Each side wants to use Japan as a tool to promote its future goals. This situation is enough to increase suspicion and sow the seeds of future conflict. Therefore, all countries that have suffered from Japanese aggression should cooperate closely, and the Far Eastern Commission should also be strengthened so that it is not just a formality. It would be best if the United States adopted broad opinions and abandoned its current policy.</p>
<p>Sino-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, we have always been satisfied, but they should be improved. The Northeast question also needs to be resolved. Sincere negotiations are the only way to avoid misunderstandings. Taking over the administration of Dalian is feasible at any time. This matter depends on the outcome of the current negotiations in the Northeast. These negotiations are mostly technical in nature, but some aspects are of a higher standard.</p>

<h3>Truth About the Nanjing Massacre: Witnesses Give Indignant Testimony; Public Trial Period May Be Extended by One Day</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, Tani Hisao, continued to be tried on the 7th. Witnesses and victims were called to testify. At exactly 2:00 PM, Judge Shi and others arrived in court. The suspect Tani was escorted to the court and remained extremely calm. First, the judge asked him about the date he entered the city and when he was transferred. Tani replied: I entered the city on the morning of the 3rd. On the 15th, I began transferring from inside and outside the Zhonghua Gate to Wuhu. The transfer continued on the 16th and 17th and was completed on the 19th. Then, Chen Yaodong, Deputy Speaker of the Nanjing City Council, reported on the investigation of the enemy's crimes, stating: I have been dedicated to the investigation since July 1st of last year, with a total of 2,784 cases, divided into ten categories: (1) shooting cases, 1,159 cases, (2) stabbing cases, 667 cases, (3) mass slaughter cases, 315 cases, (4) burning to death cases, 136 cases, (5) beating to death cases, 69 cases, (6) cases of torture followed by murder, 33 cases, (7) cases of rape followed by murder, 20 cases, (8) bombing cases, 19 cases, (9) drowning cases, 11 cases, (10) other cases, 321 cases. Among them, the following are noteworthy: (1) one-third of the cases occurred in the area outside the Zhonghua Gate, that is, within the defendant's defense zone, (2) the most cases occurred between the 12th and 20th, which was the period when the defendant was stationed in Nanjing. Finally, Chen requested that, in addition to the suspect Tani, all those involved in the massacre should be extradited to China and executed according to law. Immediately, witnesses were called to testify about the truth, including Liu Chengzhong, Xie Lisan, Hu Kouzhi, Lu Yinfa, Zhang Sunshi, Li Chenshi, Gu Yanshi, and more than thirty others. Then, Ms. Cheng Jie, who was the director of the Social Services Department of Gulou Hospital at the time, appeared in court to explain. The session ended at 5:50 PM, and the trial will continue at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. There are still more than ten witnesses. After questioning on the 8th, the trial will proceed to the debate stage. Because there are many details in the case and the trial is difficult, the public trial may be extended by one day. The more important cases among the witnesses today are recorded as follows: (1) Zhao Rongsheng was a victim himself. He described in detail the scene of his struggle with the enemy, mentioning how he used his fists to repel the enemy, but because he had no weapons, he was stabbed and injured very badly. The scars are still vivid today, including eleven knife wounds on his head, two bullet scars on his neck, a gunshot wound on his left wrist, which caused the wrist to be deformed, and his left middle finger was broken. Zhao's description was vivid and moving, and even the suspect Tani, who was standing woodenly to the side, was moved by it. (2) Zhang Sunshi's husband was killed. The judge asked where the injury was. Zhang said: "How can you still look there?" Then she continued: "I have so much hatred for the Japanese devils! I can't finish talking about it in three days. I have suffered too much." The anger overflowed her words. She then said: She herself was raped by the enemy and also saw her younger sister-in-law and a neighbor raped and became ill, etc. Her tone was painful, and the listeners were furious. (3) Yu Biwen said: On that day, he and six others were surrounded by the enemy, and all five were stabbed to death. Yu was also stabbed unconscious at the time. When he woke up, he was beaten again by a Japanese police officer with a rifle butt and fainted again. He woke up again at midnight that day and immediately showed the crowd his wounds, including seven knife wounds and two gunshot wounds. (4) Liu Maosui described the Qing [situation] of his mother's death, saying that his mother was hiding in an air-raid shelter with more than thirty other people, and all of them were locked in the cave by the Japanese and died. (5) Dong Wenlong's [?], who was killed, had eleven wounds. (6) Kong Hanshi's maternal uncle, grandmother, and younger sister, a total of six people, were shot [and killed]. (7) Zhu Guoshi's father and two brothers were also seen being killed. After his father was killed, he was placed in the house and then set on fire. After the testimonies of the above witnesses, the suspect Tani also tried to argue at any time. The reasons he held were mainly that the incident (1) did not occur within his defense zone, (2) it was impossible for civilians to hide in civilian houses during the war, (3) the above situations could not have occurred and were impossible, (4) fabricated talk cannot be recognized, (5) there may have been injuries during the war, and I can only sympathize and cannot be responsible. His wording was cunning, and the audience was very angry. The court announced that the trial would continue on the 8th and then adjourned.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense continued to try the war criminal Tani Hisao on the 7th. Citizens who went to the Lixingshe to observe the trial were even more enthusiastic than on the first day, vying to see the hideous face of this evil demon. Today's trial lasted for three hours and fifty minutes, and most of the time was spent on the victims providing evidence in court.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Mayor Investigates the Whereabouts of a German Man, Who Saved the Lives of Citizens</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] The Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, is currently making every effort to investigate the whereabouts of a German man who saved the lives of thousands of Chinese people when the Japanese army was carrying out massacres in Nanjing. As the city searched for evidence of this case, it was discovered that when the Japanese army invaded Nanjing in December 1937, a certain German man, the head of the Nanjing branch of the International Relief Association, housed Chinese refugees and protected them, so that thousands of them were spared from the Japanese army's atrocities. The detailed name of this German man has not been published. At that time, he took photos of the Japanese army's atrocities. When he returned to his country in the summer of 1938 on government orders, he publicly exhibited these photos to expose the Japanese army's inhuman behavior to the German people. The exhibition was very successful, causing the Hitler government to declare that it would arrest him if he did not stop the exhibition. Mayor Shen learned that the man was already in his sixties and was living with his family in a small town in Germany and was in a very difficult situation. If he could find out his detailed address, Mayor Shen intended to provide him with financial assistance. American members of the International Relief Association also wanted to send this German man back to China and give him a pension in order to reward him for his relief efforts during the Nanjing Massacre.</p>

<h3>Large Oil Veins Discovered in Anyuan, Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Reserves Can Support 2,000 Workers for 50 Years</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 7th] A large amount of oil ore has been discovered in Anyuan, located in Southern Jiangxi. The magistrate of the county, Zhang, is currently in the province attending the All-Jiangxi Administrative Conference. He told reporters that Jiangxi Province's oil ore was discovered as early as the winter of the 13th year of the Republic of China when local people were building a stone bridge [at] Shikong [Bridge]. At that time, there were long, about two kilometers thick layers of black stone chips. The weather was very cold, and the workers burned fire to keep warm. They burned these stone chips unintentionally. The burning gave off a strong stone oil smell. The general public believed in geomancy and kept it secret. It was not until recent years that the county government hired mining experts to conduct preliminary surveys and identified it as oil ore. When the Jiangxi Provincial Political Inspection Delegation came to the county for inspection last year, it discovered a large number of ore veins. The abundance of reserves can support 2,000 miners for 50 years of mining. Currently, the oil shale discovered on the surface can be ignited. According to general estimates, the oil content is about 5 percent.</p>

Here, it is also rumored that the cause of the accident was that one wing was loaded with 200 gold bars from the Hua Fu Bank, which caused a loss of balance and caused one wing to fall to the ground first. This seems to be quite [different] from the previous statement. The company's survey personnel have recently held secret meetings in Wuchang, and the passengers' belongings brought back from Tianmen have not been publicly claimed for a long time. Therefore, accusations and speculations have arisen, and everyone hopes that this mystery will be solved soon.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Function of the Export Promotion Committee</h3>
<p>Regarding export trade, the government's important measures have been, according to past situations, roughly as follows: (1) abolishing export taxes; (2) providing loans, such as packing, negotiation, and opening letters of credit; (3) purchasing raw silk and preparing to purchase tea, and recently implementing (4) subsidies for export drafts; and (5) establishing an Export Promotion Committee.</p>
<p>Regarding the tasks that the so-called Export Promotion Committee should undertake, we have previously offered some opinions, believing that emphasis should be placed on implementation and that it should not merely be of a consultative nature, nor should it merely possess the nature of guidance and ordinary administration. However, the current explicit provision that it should "achieve the important task of promoting, supervising, and researching the development of export trade, and that it itself does not engage in any export trade, nor does it intend to monopolize or control export trade" suggests that its nature still focuses on consultation and guidance, which is obviously different from our expectations. The reason for this is that our focus is on procurement, while the government adopts subsidy or allowance measures. Therefore, there is no need for direct operation, let alone monopoly trade. In that case, this Export Promotion Committee will naturally become an Export Advisory Committee or a Guidance Committee.</p>
<p>Even so, in terms of promoting, supervising, and researching development, this committee is indeed not without benefit, and it is considered very important, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) It has the effect of raising awareness. The prosperity or decline of export trade is by no means just a matter of the interests of exporters; it concerns the entire national economy. We have repeatedly pointed this out. Now there is a specialized agency trusted by the government that constantly researches, investigates, advises, and assists, in order to awaken the attention of the authorities. This effect is naturally more valuable than the committee's own function.</p>
<p>(2) It has the function of communicating opinions. According to the organization of the committee, in addition to the ex officio and appointed members, there are also well-known experts from China and abroad. In addition to setting up an executive committee, branch offices are also established in major commercial ports. Its function is naturally to gather wisdom from all sources and to collect information and opinions from various places. In that case, regarding A, the shortcomings of the current methods; B, recommendations for what should be done but has not been done; and C, the hidden pains and difficulties of industry and commerce in various places, it is hoped that they can be collected as much as possible and faithfully fulfill the responsibility of conveying them.</p>
<p>(3) It has the responsibility of practical improvement. Although the committee itself does not engage in any export trade, among the four prescribed tasks, there are clauses such as A, removing the difficulties encountered by export goods; B, encouraging agricultural production and processing manufacturing; C, improving methods to promote exports; and D, promoting overseas consumer markets. Therefore, in export trade, the committee will at least fulfill its responsibilities of indirect assistance and direct promotion. In other words, although the committee does not directly engage in exports, it indirectly promotes exports and facilitates exports. Therefore, calling it Export Promotion is not an empty name.</p>
<p>The problem is that the goal is too big, which clearly shows that the task is heavy and the road is long. To make this check fully cashed and truly achieve the purpose of promoting exports, it seems that ordinary general committees that sit and talk or do some calculations cannot solve the problem, nor can simply compiling some forms and putting together a lot of numbers be effective. Take its first task as an example: the original text is "to study and remove various difficulties encountered by various export goods in various parts of the country," how extensive is the content? And how serious are all the difficulties? The general problems currently prevalent, such as transportation, security, wages, interest rates, and taxes, can almost all be included. Simply studying it is not easy, and to further remove it, merely "concentrating the experience and strength of the industrial and commercial sectors" is probably not enough. Must we concentrate the experience and strength of the government and the private sector, or can we "then be successful"?</p>
<p>As for promoting exports, the currently implemented subsidy system is naturally a powerful tool. However, the key to whether local goods can be exported is whether the price of the goods can be locked in the foreign market. In other words, after giving subsidies, can the cost be reduced to a considerable extent? It must be known that not all those who engage in export goods are exporters; most are intermediaries, manufacturers, transporters, and hoarders. Their relationship with the foreign market is not very close, so when they encounter favorable news, they all raise prices one after another, taking the opportunity to push them up. In just these past two days, export goods have only seen increases and have not heard of decreases. The situation is already very obvious. Based on this speculation, how much effect this subsidy fee will have is a very questionable matter. What's more, local goods such as raw silk and eggs are said to be unable to be exported even after receiving subsidies because the cost is too high. Therefore, whether the point of determining a reasonable price and the government investing in purchases should be abandoned seems to be worth considering. We believe that complex situations must be resolved with complex methods. Although the current method of subsidizing foreign exchange for exports is a good way to make timely amends, is it still too simple to rely solely on this method? Is the uniform doubling of subsidies, regardless of grade, appropriate? Public opinion is also quite divided. Fortunately, there is also an Export Promotion Committee that can study and improve at any time, and its affiliated executive committee was established yesterday. We are willing to contribute this issue to the committee as research material.</p>

<h3>Major Corruption Case in Ningbo Customs Bureau: Illegally Collecting Security Deposits on Tax Payments; Zhejiang Supervisory Office Confirms Facts and Impeaches</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou Office] The Zhejiang Supervisory Office recently discovered a major corruption case in the Ningbo branch of the Customs Bureau.

<h3>Strange Incident in Wujiang County Government: District Chief Sentenced to Imprisonment Still逍遙法外; Seat Untouched, Even More Formidable</h3>

After the victory, he advanced to Yanmu and obtained his current position. Wu, relying on his merits, was reckless and unscrupulous. Last year, he captured three suspected bandits, Li Fusheng, Zhu Dingbang, and Chen Awu, and three suspected collaborators, Gong Jinsheng, Wang Haiqing, and Mo Changsheng. After lengthy negotiations, he did not obtain any results. In a fit of anger, they were all tied up, shot, and then reported to the county for handling. The former County Chief Gu Duan believed that the District Chief disregarded the law and arbitrarily exercised the power of life and death, which was inappropriate, so he transferred Wu to the Jiangsu High Court for questioning. He was subsequently transferred to the Wujiang District Court for trial. He was sentenced to seven years and six months of imprisonment for the crime of incitement to murder. It has been three months and he has not been executed. There has been no impact on his position as District Chief. Recently, he has become even more intensified, colluding with township chiefs and imposing quotas for money and rice under various names, such as exemption fees for conscripts, fees for collecting conscripts, and fees for purchasing firearms. The people could not bear his abuse and jointly elected six representatives, including Zhuang Liangsheng, to petition the Party and government agencies in the county for relief. After Wu District Chief learned of this, he ordered the arrest of the representatives. Among them, Zhong Jinfu was arrested by him. Wu personally used a carrying pole to brutally beat him to vent his anger. Jinfu suffered serious injuries and was still imprisoned in the district office. Zhong's wife, Chen, has now wept and sued the Wujiang District Court, asking for justice.</p>

At that time, the headquarters in Peiping will send a plane to pick them up.</p>

<h3>Haimen Diverts Refugees</h3>
<p>[Report from our Haimen Office] Qinglong Port in this county is the transportation hub of Jiangnan and Jiangbei. Most of the refugees displaced by the disasters in northern Jiangsu pass through here to Shanghai. However, due to traffic obstacles, transportation is extremely difficult, causing the refugees to gather in increasing numbers. Common local ruffians take the opportunity to extort and deceive.

<h3>Jin Juefei, Who Used to Hold a Puppet Position, Transforms Himself and Becomes a Military Officer; Victims Present Evidence and File Charges</h3>
<p>[Report from our Tacang Office] Jin Renzhi from Taicang, currently a staff officer in the First Pacification District Command, changed his name to Jin Juefei and is stationed in Kunshan. Jin Renzhi, also known as Jin Weizheng, served as the District Chief of the puppet Wuxian urban area and the Director of the puppet Wuxian County Party Headquarters during the enemy and puppet period. He also served as the Section Chief of the Transformation Section of the puppet Special Jiangsu Experimental District and the Deputy Director of the Taicang Puppet Special Station. He was a disciple of the great traitor Zhang Deqin. During his tenure in the puppet position, he was arrogant, abused innocent people, and framed underground workers and patriots. The people of Su, Kun, and Tai who suffered from his poison were countless. During the enemy and puppet period, he was once detained by the enemy police but was released by Zhang Deqin. After the victory, he hid in fear of punishment. Unexpectedly, the Jin traitor's skills were astonishing. Not long after [blank] residence, he changed his name to Jin Juefei and, with the appearance of an anti-Japanese warrior, took a position in the military organization and mixed into the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, winning a military position.

<h3>Former Tannery Workers Want to Resume Work</h3>
<p>We are a group of unemployed workers who worked at the Jiangnan Tannery operated by the enemy in Tanzhiwan, Zhabei before the war. When the war broke out, we held national concepts and voluntarily stopped working, abandoning our promotions, bonuses, and savings, and resolutely left the factory and ran to other places, living a subhuman life. Now our country has won the victory and the enemy has surrendered. The factory buildings have been taken over by the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the government, so we should have hope of resuming work. ——However, the state took back this factory and does not manufacture leather. It is said that it will be converted into a Sichuan oil press. Although we want to enter the factory to work, we cannot be called veterans. However, our only goal is to work, and our only target is this factory building. Whether it is a veteran or a new worker, as long as you are willing to use us, that is enough. But I don't know what method to use or where to apply. I would like to ask your newspaper to be fair and publish this in a corner to seek guidance from the social authorities. (Yang Shangyou, representative of more than 40 workers from the former Jiangnan Tannery)</p>
<h3>Kunshan Agricultural Products Do Not Benefit Farmers</h3>
<p>Not long after the victory, the Kunshan Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank and the Kunshan County Bank were successively established in my hometown of Kunshan. As for the main business of the Farmers Bank, it is to support the countryside, so in the hearts of ordinary farmers, they believe that with such a rural relief organization, they are naturally overjoyed. However, judging from the current situation, how much can actually benefit? On the contrary, it has become a general hub for large merchants to lend, speculate, and exploit farmers. According to the Jiangsu Provincial Morning People's Bank, the interest rate published in the newspaper is 5%, but sometimes it reaches 9%. The interest rate of Kunshan County Bank is 7% in the newspaper, and sometimes the interest rate reaches 15%. With such high interest rates, it is still difficult for real farmers to be able to obtain a loan. In this situation, only merchants can store white rice and cloth in the warehouse to obtain speculative funds, but wouldn't it be a loss of the government's purpose of helping the countryside? I hope that the bank's executives will make some corrections so that the poor farmers can obtain real benefits. (Qian Bozhang)</p>
<h3>Identity Cards Delayed</h3>
<p>We live in the Subei Refugee Refugee Village on Dapu Road. Last August, we applied to the Bao Chief's Office for national identity cards. We paid an application fee of 100 yuan and received an application form. When the form was filled out and submitted, we also paid a handling fee of 100 yuan. We asked them to issue receipts for the identity cards. They said that they would be issued together with the identity cards in two days. Unexpectedly, until today, there are neither types of documents. I don't know what is the reason for this situation? (A citizen) Editor's note: This newspaper previously received a letter from the Civil Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government stating that if there are any delays in applying for identity cards, you can send a letter to the department with your residential address and Bao Jia household number, and it will be verified and issued (see this column on January 26). Please contact them.</p>

<h3>Problem of Entrusting the Governance of Japanese-Controlled Islands: US States Policy Unchanged, But Decides to Postpone Submission to the Security Council</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 6th] The US government does not change its suggestion to place the Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific Ocean under US strategic trusteeship. However, due to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom not agreeing to endorse this plan in advance, its submission to the Security Council will be postponed. The State Department stated that the agreement in the proposal was announced during last year's United Nations General Assembly and was originally intended to be submitted to the Security Council this month. However, Britain and the Soviet Union sent notes to the United States, advocating that the disposal of these islands should be postponed until after the Japanese peace treaty is agreed upon, causing the United States to decide to postpone the proposal temporarily.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] It is heard that the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia have advised the United States to temporarily shelve the trusteeship of the Pacific strategic islands, pending the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. While the United Kingdom and Australia have expressed acceptance in principle regarding the US intent for trusteeship, the Soviet Union will regard it as "US imperialism" and oppose it. Although the Soviet Union has not yet submitted a formal note on this matter, it has always opposed the expansion of US interests or responsibilities. So far, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Australia have only provided opinions to the State Department regarding the US request for trusteeship. The islands that the US requests to administer include the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands. The United States has clearly stated that it wants to maintain administrative rights over these islands but is willing to place them under the trusteeship of the United Nations organization.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Future Foreign Ministers' Meeting: The United States Will Adapt to Circumstances; The Soviet Foreign Minister Opposes Destroying Germany</h3>
<p>Poland Inquires About the Attitudes of Britain and the United States Regarding the Western Border Issue</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] According to well-informed sources here, the United States does not have a definite policy regarding the future Moscow meeting. It is widely believed that differing opinions need to be discussed in another meeting to reach an agreement. This is the reason for the lack of a definite policy. Generally, the United States will adapt to circumstances and not prepare in advance. The US diplomatic community hopes that this meeting will not discuss the same issues as the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, but will seek a practical solution to the German problem. The State Department supports granting Germany the greatest freedom to form its future government but does not believe that Allied control is necessary to prevent the revival of German militarism.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 6th] A commentator on Moscow Radio recently quoted Foreign Minister Molotov as saying that any plan that aims to destroy or liquidate Germany, or to implement a federation or partition it, is opposed by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Regarding the western border of Poland, it has recently come to light that the new Polish Ambassador to the United States, Winiewicz, will submit a note to the State Department on this matter, reiterating the Polish government's view. In short, the resolution passed at the Potsdam Conference has already been accepted by the powers, and there is no other way forward except to approve it. At the same time, Polish Special Envoy Professor Grabski will also submit a similar note to the British government. Poland, in view of the imminent opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, sent a special envoy to Britain to test the British government's opinion on this matter. However, according to well-informed sources here, the attitude of the United States has not changed, that is, it believes that the boundary line stipulated at the Potsdam Conference is temporary and should be re-discussed by the four foreign ministers in Moscow.</p>

<h3>US House of Representatives Passes Constitutional Amendment</h3>
<p>Presidential Term Not to Exceed Two Terms</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 6th] The US House of Representatives today voted by 285 to 121 to limit the US president's term of office to a maximum of two terms, each term being four years. This bill, in the form of an amendment to the US Constitution, has now been submitted to the Senate. The US Constitution only stipulates that the president is elected once every four years but does not specify the number of terms the president can serve. US custom has been that the president does not serve more than two terms, but President Roosevelt broke this tradition and was re-elected for a third and fourth term. According to the provisions of the Constitution, amending the Constitution can be done by a two-thirds majority vote in both houses of Congress, and then approved by a three-quarters majority of the US states. According to current calculations, three-quarters of the states is 36 states.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Committee Rules of Procedure: US and Soviet Union Fail to Reach Agreement</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 7th Radio Broadcast: The United States and the Soviet Union failed to reach an agreement today on the rules of procedure for the United Nations Disarmament Committee.

<p>[Reuters, New York, 7th] Soviet representative Gromyko and US representative Austin will meet again this morning to discuss the Security Council's future handling of the two issues of disarmament and atomic energy. A senior US official revealed yesterday that after a seven-hour meeting, the Drafting Committee showed that the Soviet Union intended to deny the Atomic Energy Committee and wanted the Disarmament Committee to be able to handle atomic weapons and other armaments. The United States insists that international control of atomic energy should proceed without waiting for the establishment of the Disarmament Committee. The Drafting Committee, composed of six countries, is scheduled to meet again at 2:00 PM today to make a final attempt to formulate a plan acceptable to both the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>The United States Wants to Liquidate Lend-Lease Accounts: The Soviet Government Ignores It; The United States Also Has Not Received a Reply to the Request for the Return of Ships</h3>

<h3>Diamond Smuggling Case: The Contents are Quite Mysterious; Morley Said the Source Cannot Be Announced</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 6th] Colonel Morley, a suspect in the smuggling of a large number of diamonds and jewels, is currently held in Mason Fortress. He once served as the supervisor of the vault of the Bank of Japan. Today, he declared that the jewels were not taken from the vault and the source cannot be announced.

Military regulations do not prohibit the purchase of goods, but Morley did not explain that these diamonds were purchased in Japan, only saying that he did not feel that he had done anything wrong. In other words, he did not believe that these diamonds were obtained by theft, so he did not commit a crime. Morley said he did not know when he would be sent back to Tokyo. Customs officials said that if the military authorities do not prosecute, the customs authorities will prosecute him for smuggling.</p>

<h3>The United Kingdom is Considering New Plans to Solve the Palestine Problem: Foreign Secretary Bevin Meets with Jewish Association Leaders; Jewish Terrorists Vow to Fight to the Death</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] Regarding the plan that the United Kingdom has drawn up to solve the Palestine problem, it has recently come to light from reliable sources that the British government will present this plan to Arab representatives and the Zionist movement in the near future, and its contents are expected to be announced tomorrow. According to information gathered by this agency's reporters from various sources, the main points of the plan are as follows: (1) Palestine will be divided into two regions, one Jewish region and one Arab region. (2) A central government will be organized in Jerusalem by the British, Arab, and Jewish parties. (3) Jerusalem will be divided into three districts, one belonging to the Jews, one belonging to the Arabs, and another smaller district belonging to the Christian minority. (4) 100,000 Jews will move into the Jewish region. (5) After the number of Jews moving into Palestine exceeds 100,000, they must first obtain the approval of the central government before they can continue to immigrate into the country. (6) The Arabs should provide full guarantees for the Jewish minority living in the Arab region. (7) The Jews should also provide the same guarantees for the Arab minority living in the Jewish region. (8) After the announcement of this plan, the number of Jews in the Arab region must not increase.</p>
<p>According to other sources, the central government stipulated in the British plan is only temporary in nature. The United Kingdom intends to establish an Arab-Jewish National Assembly in Palestine in the near future, especially to organize a new government in the future, but its powers must be limited. Palestine will eventually be handed over to the United Nations for trusteeship, and the trusteeship agreement will include the sixth, seventh, and eighth items mentioned above. In addition, the United Kingdom will also attempt to borrow loans from the United States for the Arab region, so that the Arabs can achieve a similar standard of living as the Jews.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Foreign Secretary Bevin and Colonial Secretary Jones met with the leaders of the Jewish Association at the Colonial Office today for two hours.

<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The Republic of Vietnam's representatives stationed in Britain and France exploring peace, and the French government's telegram to Special Envoy d'Argenlieu in Vietnam to return home, all foreshadow the efforts of both sides to end the war. The head of the Republic of Vietnam delegation in France, No-Tang, declared today that President Ho Chi Minh has proposed a reconciliation plan, calling for a full ceasefire and the withdrawal of all troops to the original defenses stipulated in the Franco-Vietnamese agreement.

<h3>MacArthur Writes to Prime Minister Yoshida, Hoping that Japan Will Hold a General Election: There is No Need to Establish a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 7th] MacArthur Headquarters announced this afternoon a letter from MacArthur to Prime Minister Yoshida, stating: The time has come to implement a general election. Since the decision to hold a general election, a year has passed. Major changes have taken place in Japan's domestic institutions, economic conditions, and the lives of the Japanese people. The Japanese people should express their democratic will again in the near future to solve the fundamental problems facing Japanese society. The clear fact that a general election should be held should be judged by the Japanese government. However, in order for the new legislature to effectively implement the new constitution immediately, the general election should be implemented as soon as possible after the parliament is adjourned. The results achieved in the past year have been very good, and I am confident that this will continue in the future. It is reported that the current regular session of the parliament will resume on the 10th, with a session period of three months. In addition, after receiving the letter from MacArthur, the Japanese government immediately held a cabinet meeting and decided that Yoshida would explain when the parliament resumes and announce the policy direction, as well as state that once the parliament's mission is over, it will immediately dissolve the parliament to comply with MacArthur's wishes. Secretary-General Ono of the Liberal Party recently stated that there is no need to establish a coalition cabinet. The Liberal and Progressive parties should strengthen their cooperation so that the conservative front can achieve victory in the general election. Secretary-General Tanaka of the Progressive Party stated that when the general election is implemented, he will compete with the Socialist Party. The Progressive Party should cooperate with its friendly party, the Liberal Party, to strengthen the conservative camp. A former central committee member of the Nationalist Party stated that the result of the general election is that the turbid air of the current political situation can be expected to clear up. Secretary-General Norikawa of the Cooperative Democratic Party expressed his support for dissolving the parliament, and the new regime can be decided by public opinion.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Submits Approval to Resume Flights: Three Routes to Fly First Today; Formal Order from the Ministry of Communications Should Arrive the Day After Tomorrow; Prosecutor Investigates the Truth of the Rumor That Gold Was Hidden in the Wings</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation previously had its flights suspended again by order of the Ministry of Communications due to the crash of China National Aviation Corporation's No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing passenger plane in Tianmen, western Hubei. This has been almost ten days. The two companies have experienced a sharp decrease in income and significant losses since passenger transport was suspended. They have requested the authorities to allow them to resume flights first and then gradually adjust and improve. It has recently come to light that China National Aviation Corporation has first obtained approval and will resume three passenger aircraft routes starting today: (1) Shanghai-Guangzhou-Hong Kong route, (2) Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Kunming route, (3) Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Chongqing route. Once the formal order from the Ministry of Communications is received, all passenger flights on each route will also resume flying. This order should arrive on Monday next week. As for the issue of the resumption of passenger flights on each route of China Airlines, there is still no clue so far.</p>
<p>In addition, after the crash of China Airlines' No. 145 047-type Shanghai-Chongqing route plane on the 30th of last month in Tianmen County, Hubei, there were various rumors about the cause of the accident. Recently, there were rumors that the aircraft had 200 gold bars weighing 70 kilograms hidden in its wings, causing it to lose balance and cause the disaster. Chief Prosecutor Huang of the Municipal District Procuratorate attached great importance to this case. In order to investigate the truth and responsibility of the aircraft crash, he specially sent two prosecutors, Shen Zushou and Zhu Xiyu, to Longhua Airport yesterday to investigate. The two prosecutors went to the airport for investigation at 10:00 AM yesterday and returned to the procuratorate at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Presenting Eight Factors of the Fire; All Firefighters Send Letter to the Assembly Calling for Attention</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] All firefighters of the Xinzha District Fire Department in this city, after the fire case on Seymour Road, faced criticism from public opinion. This led to the dismissal of three to five corrupt elements, causing innocent parties to suffer. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Municipal Council, appealing for understanding, which stated in brief: The Wuding Road fire has become a topic of after-dinner conversation for citizens, and firefighters have been universally labeled as extortionists and robbers, causing the entire force to suffer unjust accusations, which is extremely unfair. Regarding this case, we are willing to accept the truth and expose illegal personnel.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the spread of the Wuding Road fire, it was by no means due to extortion by firefighters. The factors can be summarized in the following eight items: (1) All kinds of firefighting equipment currently in the city are those used for decades since the era of the former Municipal Council. In this severe winter season, the weather is extremely cold, and the lack of water heaters in the living quarters of each fire squadron affects the freezing of fire trucks, delaying response time. (2) The gasoline for fire trucks and ambulances is in constant shortage. The entire fire brigade only receives 1,500 gallons of gasoline per month, which is distributed among the districts, and each district feels it is insufficient. Therefore, fire trucks often run out of gasoline, which is one of the reasons for delays. (3) In the era of the Municipal Council, each person had two pairs of leather boots, which have now been canceled. The only rubber boots have countless holes and cannot be waterproof. Furthermore, uniforms have not been changed until now, while the police have already been allocated Melton wool, which is incomprehensible. Every time they return from fighting a fire, the cold penetrates their bones. It is impossible to take a hot bath, and even changing uniforms is not possible, causing extreme suffering. (4) Firefighters' salaries are meager, while prices are soaring, making it difficult for individuals to feed themselves, let alone support their families, which affects their work morale. Most are disheartened and passive. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will provide guarantees that the government should bear the living expenses of the families of those who die in the line of duty. Only then will our colleagues be able to dedicate themselves to completing our great mission. (5) Many fire hydrants in various parts of the city are damaged or stolen, delaying firefighting time. It is hoped that citizens will assist in their maintenance. (6) There is an urgent need to add more water hoses. Most of the water hoses in each squadron are old and rotten. Every time a fire occurs, they burst, delaying rescue work. (7) In the era of the former Municipal Council, once a fire occurred, the fire department, police department, power company, and water company all sent personnel to the scene to assist. But now, traffic congestion and disorder greatly affect rescue work. (8) Currently, the windows and light bulbs inside and outside the rooms of each district team are mostly damaged. Repairs should be the responsibility of the authorities, but currently, all expenses are borne by us, which is truly unbearable exploitation. We sincerely hope that the representatives of the Council will uphold justice, etc.</p>
<h3>Reform the Atmosphere, Improve Treatment: The Mayor Expresses</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the fire case on Shaanxi South Road, a newspaper reported that Mayor Wu had said, "The government's thunder is loud, but the size of the raindrops depends entirely on the court." Mayor Wu solemnly stated to reporters yesterday that he did not make this statement. He only said that the criminal part of the case is being handled by the court, and the administrative part will be dealt with separately after the investigation committee completes its investigation. Regarding the atmosphere of the fire brigade, Mayor Wu said yesterday that it must be improved. The issue of treatment definitely needs to be improved, and the authorities should do their best to find a way. Firefighting equipment also needs to be improved within the possible scope. The authorities are currently planning closely.</p>
<h3>Two Policemen Wrongfully Accused: Released After Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to Police Chief Zhang's statement to reporters, police officers No. 1850 and No. 335, who were detained on suspicion in the fire case, were proven by Yang Junshan and Yin Bingquan, the owners of No. 3, Lane 660, to have acted bravely at the time and not to have taken advantage of the fire to rob. At the same time, the police department also found no evidence, so they were released on bail yesterday.</p>
<h3>Excavation of the Wang Family Fire Site: More Utensils Continue to Be Discovered</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The excavation of the Wang family fire site continued yesterday. Zhang Da, Chief of the Inspection Division of the Police Department, Baozhang Cai Guoliang, and Wang Yunfu himself all personally went to the site to supervise. The excavation resulted in the discovery of one silver ingot, one Near-to-Love brand gold pocket watch, one silver pocket watch, one pair of silver vases, one silver-plated fruit plate, one silver crucifix, one table scale, one electric fan, one silver basin, one electric furnace, one cabinet door handle, one unlicensed electricity meter, five copper rings and six hinges from a box, seventeen keys, and three private drafts of Wang Chuiging. Unfortunately, they were all burned and unusable.</p>
<h3>Failing to Rescue and Taking the Opportunity to Solicit Bribes: The District Prosecutor's Office Is Actively Investigating</h3>
<p>Regarding the Seymour Road fire case, the five-person investigation committee prepared a report based on the criminal-related materials obtained from the investigation and submitted it to the mayor. After approval and referral to the court for investigation, Chief Prosecutor Huang of the District Prosecutor's Office stated that firefighters' duty is to rescue people from fires. Failing to rescue and taking the opportunity to solicit bribes is a violation of the law. This office is currently actively investigating. If such illegal behavior is confirmed, a public prosecution will be filed according to law.</p>
<h3>Investigation Committee Continues to Visit Various Districts: Tools Mostly Damaged, Personnel Complain</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Seymour Road Fire Investigation Committee, and others continued to visit fire stations in the Xinzha District, Huxi District, and Taishan District at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to inspect firefighting facilities. They carefully observed everything, including the fire alarm control room, fire trucks, pumps, belts, rescue vehicles, and gas masks. They found that many were damaged, especially the belts. For more than ten years, firefighting facilities have never been added, so there are very few intact ones. Most are full of holes and patched repeatedly. Moreover, the fire trucks currently in use are at least ten years old, and some have been used for twenty or thirty years, resulting in poor operation, which affects the response time.</p>
<p>Most of the firefighters in each district team complained incessantly and vented their grievances to reporters. Fire police officer No. 105 in the Xinzha District complained to reporters yesterday: "I am already seventy-one years old and have been working as a firefighter for thirty-five years. Today is the first day I have suffered this kind of hardship! If it weren't for the fact that Mayor Wu still owes me more than two thousand yuan (referring to the retirement payment from the Municipal Council) and a monthly salary of 150,000 yuan, I would have run away long ago."</p>
<h3>Shelter Achieves Excellent Results: Councilors Ask for Support</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Municipal Council Social Affairs Committee members Liu Jingji, Zhang Zhongyuan, Yao Baozhen, Dong Rengui, and Tong Xiang and others inspected the social welfare agencies under the Social Affairs Bureau a few days ago. They concluded that the Caohejing Refugee and Orphan Shelter was well-managed and achieved excellent results. Yesterday afternoon, they invited Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing and Budget Committee member Li Wenjie and Finance Committee member Guo Linsuang to the 12th floor of Wing On Department Store to report on the inspection process and appeal for active support and assistance to the shelter. Director Zhou Wang of the shelter also attended the meeting to report on the shelter's situation. During the meeting, Councilor Zhang and others expressed their hope that government budgets for similar charitable relief efforts should not only not be reduced but should also be subsidized. Deputy Speaker Xu also said: "I am very pleased to learn today that the shelter has achieved such excellent results and should be given more attention. The Budget Committee should also consider assisting in this matter. In addition, nurseries and other such institutions should also be actively established to serve the community as much as possible." Finally, Councilor Li Wenjie put forward three points: (1) Budget increases and decreases should be based on the needs of the cause. (2) The government has a complete set of procedures for the payment of approved budgets. If Director Zhou needs funds urgently, he can find ways to raise them temporarily. (3) Relief efforts can be planned to transform the passive into the active. Then, it will not be difficult to gain social sympathy and support in the future.</p>

After Zhou's report, Qian Naixin, Director Fang, Director Zhao, Speaker Pan, and others spoke in succession. Speaker Pan pointed out that the current high prices, high wages, and high interest rates are all interrelated, and the crux of the problem is inflation. The expansion of currency is due to the communist Party's trouble-making. Therefore, we must now use the power of the people to stop the trouble-making behavior to seek peaceful unification, and we must judge right from wrong in order to have true peace. Finally, the meeting passed a temporary suggestion to send a letter to Mayor Wu to retain Director Wu Kaixian and a letter to Director Wu urging him to dismiss his resignation.

<h3>Shanghai Garrison Commander Fu Will Inspect Wusong and Baoshan Districts; No Deferment for Special Occupations</h3>
<p>Fu Zhengmo, the first commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, has been actively preparing for conscription work in the city since arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing. However, since the Military Affairs Section of the Municipal Civil Affairs Department has just been established, some preparatory work has not yet been completed, so the date of conscription in the city is still undetermined.

<h3>Land Administration Bureau Faces Difficulties in Layoffs; Manpower Already Insufficient; Layoffs Will Reduce Efficiency</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, some members of the Municipal Council and the outside world have expressed that the Land Administration Bureau can tighten its expenses and lay off some staff. A reporter visited the bureau to inquire about their views. According to them, the Land Administration Bureau is different from the Police Department, the Public Works Bureau, and others. They are engaged in regular work, such as maintaining public order or building roads. The main work of the Land Administration Bureau is land registration and land surveying. There are approximately 700,000 land registration maps and charts left over from the former concession and the puppet government, which urgently need to be sorted out. After the victory, land registration was carried out, and applications were made for the reissuance of land ownership certificates. Due to the complicated procedures and insufficient staff, only about 50,000 certificates were issued in the past year. There are currently more than 120,000 certificates awaiting issuance. Other regular work includes requests for land division and certificate replacement. Land surveying is like a census, which must be completed in a short period of time with concentrated efforts; otherwise, changes in the land will make it difficult to investigate. This matter is not easy to understand for those who are not in charge of the matter and have not experienced it firsthand. The Land Administration Bureau already feels that manpower is insufficient, and it is estimated that it will take another two years to complete the current work. Therefore, even if it wants to lay off staff, it should be considered after two years. If the Council passes a resolution that layoffs must be carried out now, it can only be considered for the administrative staff, but there is one principle, that is, it must not hinder work efficiency, and it is hoped that the business staff will be added. If both administrative and business staff are to be reduced, the estimated time to complete the work will be extended, and if there is less manpower, it will not be possible to concentrate on the work, and efficiency will be reduced.</p>
<p>Secretary Yang of the bureau also led reporters to visit the work situation in various departments, such as review and drawing. According to reports, many people have left due to low salaries.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws and Handcarts Must Have Lights at Night</h3>
<p>In order to maintain military safety, the Public Utilities Bureau has ordered that all rickshaws and handcarts be confiscated if they do not have lights on at night.

<h3>Tang Huaiqun Robbed; Losses of 20 Million</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Tang Huaiqun, a famous lawyer, lives at No. 9, Lane 50, Yingshi Road.

After speaking, they proceeded to rob him, taking away diamond rings, gold jewelry, clothes, etc., with a total value of more than 20 million yuan.</p>
<h3>There Is No Shortage of Gasoline; Why Panic?; Oil Companies Say</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The phenomenon of gasoline panic has not improved in recent days. Although gasoline stations have been limiting each vehicle to only three gallons per fill-up since yesterday, supply is still falling short of demand. Long lines of cars waiting for gasoline can be seen everywhere. According to the opinion of a person in charge of an oil company, the main reason for this phenomenon is unnecessary mass panic. The reasons for the panic are nothing more than the following: (1) Suspecting that there is insufficient gasoline in the city and that imports will be difficult in the future. (2) Half a month ago, due to delays in exchange settlement procedures, Customs did not unseal the gasoline, and the source of gasoline was cut off for a while. Car owners were deeply afraid that the same situation would occur again in the future. (3) Rumors that the exchange rate will soon change and that gasoline prices will be increased. (4) Some people are taking the opportunity to hoard large quantities of gasoline, storing it in their homes, or selling it on the black market. Based on this mentality, the demand for gasoline has increased sharply. With the current number of motor vehicles in the city reaching more than 20,000 (according to the recent estimates of the Public Utilities Bureau), which is twice that of the pre-war period, each gasoline station has seen congestion and sell-outs in a "stampede" situation.</p>
<p>Import Quota of US$2.5 Million Every Three Months</p>
<p>In fact, according to the person in charge, there is no shortage of gasoline in the city. The current gasoline import quota is US$2.5 million every three months, which is enough to meet normal needs. There is no need to adopt restrictions such as quota allocation. Even if the price increases due to exchange rate adjustments, the amount that users can hoard is limited. It is not worth risking fire for a small amount. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will not worry unnecessarily.</p>
<h3>Three Companies Discuss and Formulate Improvement Measures</h3>
<p>[Another Report] The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in view of the recent abnormal supply and demand of gasoline and the phenomenon of cars lining up on the roadside, which not only hinders traffic but also allows some people to take the opportunity to purchase large quantities of gasoline and store it in their homes, which is prone to fire, convened representatives from Asia Petroleum, Texaco, and Mobil on February 5 to discuss the matter and formulate three improvement measures in order to avoid creating a black market and protect public safety: (1) If the oil companies have a large amount of gasoline in storage but insufficient oil transportation equipment, they should give priority to transporting the gasoline required by gasoline stations so that they can supply a large amount. (2) The license plate number and gasoline volume of vehicles fueling at gasoline stations should be recorded in detail by the three companies. If it is discovered that there are vehicles attempting to store gasoline by making abnormal purchases, and the investigation confirms that this is the case, the stations will be notified to stop supplying gasoline to those vehicles in the future. (3) All gasoline at gasoline stations should be sold as soon as it arrives and sold out. If managers refuse to supply gasoline and attempt to store it for sale on the black market, citizens can report it to the Public Utilities Bureau in confidence, and it will be dealt with severely in accordance with the regulations after investigation.</p>
<h3>Fang Jiuhe Swindled Out of a Large Golden Fish</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, a middle-aged man wearing an overcoat and about 30 years old, carrying a travel bag, went to Fang Jiuhe Silver Store at No. 519 Jinling East Road with a boy, saying that he wanted to buy a large gold bar. Wang Zhongdao, a shop assistant, took out a gold bar weighing 10 taels and 1 qian and 8 fen (Da Feng Heng brand). The man said that he needed to take it to another store to weigh it and left with the gold bar. The store thought that he had a child with him and that there was money in the travel bag, so they did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, he did not return for a long time, and they began to suspect something. They opened the travel bag to check and found that it was full of blank paper and not banknotes. They realized that they had been cheated and immediately reported it to the Songshan Branch Bureau, which ordered police officer Yang Jinhong to take the boy and the travel bag to the police station. According to the boy, Ji Jizhao, 13 years old, lives at No. 62 Zhengjia Muqiao Street. When he was playing near Dongxinqiao, the man asked him for the address of Fang Jiuhe Silver Store and ordered him to lead the way. He was deceived for a moment and did not dare to collude with the swindler. He was instructed to be taken home by his parents, and a wanted notice was issued to apprehend the swindler and bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Impersonating a Guild, a Swindler Defrauds Businesses: Multiple Importers and Exporters Deceived</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Importers and Exporters Association, located at 12 Creek Road, has over a thousand members. On the 3rd, they all received a letter from the association stating that the executive committee had approved a fee of 50,000 yuan per member. It claimed that several companies, including Jit Sang Tai &amp; Co., Chung Mou Trading Co., Ta Wei &amp; Co., Lixin Hua &amp; Co., Xiang Li &amp; Co., Shanghai Import and Export Co., Yong Chang Industrial Raw Materials Co., Heng Tai Hua &amp; Co., Jing An Enterprise Co., Pacific Industrial and Commercial Federation, British Tyler &amp; Co., Yi Li Enterprise Co., and San Wei &amp; Co., had already paid. British Tyler &amp; Co. reportedly gave a check for 100,000 yuan at the time. Other companies called the association to inquire about the matter. The association denied having made such a decision and secretly reported it to the Pudong Branch Bureau for investigation. Director Zhang of the Branch Bureau ordered Chief of the Criminal Division Li Yinmin to supervise officers Wang Zhicheng, Police Chief Fu Yunfeng, Wang Shenquan, and others to investigate. After four days, they solved the case yesterday at noon and arrested the suspect for prosecution. The check paid by British Tyler &amp; Co., numbered 686368, was issued by Chung Mou Bank to Xie Xin Hua &amp; Co. The investigation revealed that the check had been received by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the number 1732 was written on the back. Further investigation revealed that the account holder was named Cao Zhizhan, living at 190 Beijing Road, Room 44. They went to the address, but it was an empty room. They returned to the Savings Bureau to investigate the introducer for the account opening and found out it was a Mr. Yu Rong, living at 83 An Yi Road. However, inquiries at that address found no such person. They returned to the association to discuss the matter for a long time and discovered that the letter and seal were both forged, but the letterhead and envelope were genuine and belonged to the association. This stationery had been given to Cao Zhizhan of the Economic Express News Agency at 35 Mauger Road (Cao had worked there as a salesman two months prior) for use when introducing clients. Police officers disguised themselves and waited at the agency. Yesterday at 11:40 a.m., they arrested Cao at the agency. Cao initially denied everything. During interrogation at the bureau, he confessed that he lived at 4 Zhujia Ku, Da Xi Road. The police then escorted him to his residence and found forged seals and other evidence. Cao could no longer deny the charges and admitted to defrauding over one million yuan in legal tender, which he used to make clothes and exchange for gold rings. The branch bureau plans to prosecute Cao for forging seals and defrauding for financial gain.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Military Police, Repeatedly Defrauding Hardware Merchants: Culprit Arrested with Evidence and Confessed</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The White Rock Road Military Police yesterday arrested Sun Guozhang, also known as Sun Rong, who impersonated a member of the team to attempt to steal and sell military cables. After interrogation by Captain Deng of the team, he confessed. The team, based on a tip, intercepted five rolls of military cable of unknown origin at 17 Jinghe Wind, Shilu, Sanma Road, on September 17 last year, valued at over 10 million yuan. Because the main suspect was at large, the materials were impounded and reported to superiors for instructions. Before receiving instructions, troops were assigned to guard them. Recently, Sun Guozhang impersonated a squad leader from the White Rock Road Military Police, privately carved the seals of the Battalion Headquarters of the 23rd Regiment, 1st Battalion, and the signature seal of Battalion Commander Xiong Fei. He forged documents and went to Heng Lv Hardware and Steel Store at 27 Wusong Road at the end of last month, claiming to have five rolls of military cable for sale and asking the store to send someone to inspect the samples. Upon reaching the entrance of Jinghe Lane, he asked them to wait and absconded with 500,000 yuan in silver that he had brought. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, he used the same method to defraud 100,000 yuan in deposit from a hardware merchant broker at 9 Rongchang Lane, Yuhong Road, Hongkou. Yesterday morning, Sun committed fraud again by approaching Zhenfeng Hardware Weaving Shop at 182 Puan Road and swindling 1 million yuan in deposit, but he was discovered by the White Rock Road Military Police, who sent officers to arrest him. The forged documents and seals were seized on the spot. After interrogation and confirmation by the victims, it was decided to transfer him to the District Prosecutor's Office today for investigation.</p>
<h3>"Theft of the National Treasury" Outdoor Scenes to be Shot on the Bund and Elsewhere</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Wang Xiaoting, who is filming outdoor scenes for Columbia Pictures' "Theft of the National Treasury" here, told reporters that the main outdoor scenes will be shot on the Bund, Nanjing Road, Nanshi, and Longhua Airport. Scenic spots in the city, such as Longhua Pagoda, the City God Temple, and the Baoan Situ Temple, will also be filmed one by one. Wang said that if the weather is clear, outdoor shooting will begin next Monday. However, the film is set in 1935, and the street scenes are very different from today. There were no jeeps speeding down the streets, nor tricycles blocking traffic, so filming outdoor scenes will be difficult. It is reported that Mayor Wu and the Police Bureau have agreed to assist with the filming of outdoor scenes.</p>
<p>Director Nat Natcho said that he will be working here for about one to two months. After finishing, he will go to Cairo and Havana to continue filming outdoor scenes. He has found two male and three female doubles here, one of whom is Chinese. All costumes were brought from Hollywood. The two men may be recruited from the American military personnel here.</p>
<p>"Theft of the National Treasury" is a detective film starring Dick Powell, set in Washington, San Francisco, Shanghai, Cairo, and Havana (the capital of Cuba). It is based on the theme of international cooperation in drug prohibition and is based on the files of the U.S. Treasury Department's Narcotics Bureau.</p>
<p>Filming began in Hollywood on December 8 last year and is scheduled to be completed by the end of June. It is expected to be released in the second half of this year.</p>

<h3>Are All Traitors' Families Long-Lived? Living Expenses Should Have Flexibility: Seven Cases Decided by the Illegal Property Disposal Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office of the China Trust Bureau, in view of the "Precautions for Implementing the Confiscation of Traitor Property" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, has found some regulations to be difficult to implement, and has submitted a document requesting amendments.</p>
<p>One of these regulations stipulates that adult family members of traitors who are incapable of earning a living should have their entire life expectancy estimated at 70 years, and be given the necessary living expenses for the future period. The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office believes that estimating the entire life expectancy at 70 years seems too long. Moreover, traitors are sentenced to varying lengths of imprisonment. If the life expectancy of their families is uniformly estimated at 70 years, it may not correspond to the actual situation. Therefore, it is requested that the implementing agency should have some flexibility in the standards when making discretionary decisions.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Enemy and Puppet Industry Clearing Office convened its 22nd Committee on the Disposal of Illegal Property at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, and decided on the following cases: (1) Xu Liangcai reported that the illegal property houses on Zhongzheng Road and other locations were forcibly purchased by Zhou Fohai, a traitor. He now requests permission to pay the price and have them returned. Decision: The evidence is insufficient, and the request should be rejected. (2) Regarding Chu Chen Zhen's request for the return of houses, property, and daily necessities that do not belong to the Chu Minyi treason, the decision is to transfer the case to the Jiangsu Higher Court for review. (3) Yang Qian, a former prisoner, is suspected of being a traitor. His property was confiscated after an initial investigation. However, the Supreme Court acquitted him. The question is whether his property should be unsealed and returned. Decision: The matter will be discussed after the judgment becomes final. (4) Rao Jinrong, son of the traitor Rao Shu, requested the return of confiscated scattered clothing. Should we return it and submit a list for review? Decision: The matter should be discussed after the judgment becomes final. (5) Regarding the estate of Mei Siping, a traitor, in Yongjia, his stepmother Mei Wang requested confirmation that it was jointly owned, but she could not produce any documents. The question is how to handle this. Decision: Notify her to submit documents within a time limit. If the deadline is exceeded, the property will be confiscated. (6) Changzhou Tongcheng Cotton Spinning and Weaving Factory has traitorous shares owned by Yan Qingxiang, Jiang Shang, Zhang Yunbo, and other traitors. How should this be handled? Decision: First, all traitorous shares should be confiscated. Second, a letter should be sent to the Higher Prosecutor's Office to request the declaration of confiscation of Zhang Yunbo's traitorous shares. (7) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education requested priority allocation of the house of Li Bingru, a traitor, in Baijiao Lane, Hangzhou. Decision: It should be sold through public bidding.</p>
<h3>Qian Zongfan, Tough as Iron: Denies Being Wang Jingwei's Guard Captain: "If It Were True, I Could Be Shot."</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Qian Zongfan (also known as Qian Zhongfa), nicknamed "King of Lotteries," was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. The defendant was introduced by Wu Shibao and served as an inspector for the Enemy's West Shanghai Military Police at Kaimara Road, and also served as a puppet secret agent in No. 76. He opened the Rongsheng Gambling House, later renamed the Six Nations Hotel, and served as its manager. He also served as the deputy captain of Wang Jingwei's Shanghai residence guard. After the victory, he was reported by Jin Yushun, but the prosecution was dropped due to insufficient evidence. Subsequently, the Shanghai Garrison Command received a telegram from the Military Affairs Office of the National Government, transferred from the Military Intelligence Bureau, ordering the arrest of Qian Zongfan and transfer to the High Court for prosecution. The defendant, with a bald head, ruddy complexion, and obese figure, wearing a blue cloth robe, claimed to have opened the Shangtian Funeral Home and never opened the Rongsheng Gambling House or the Six Nations Hotel. He did not know Li Shiqun, Wu Shibao, Wang Maoting, etc. If he had served as Wang Jingwei's deputy guard captain for even one day, he could be shot. A few days before his arrest, he received three strange phone calls, the general meaning of which was to threaten him. He usually recited Buddhist scriptures and meditated and had never done anything bad. He was truly wronged. The defense attorney, Fei Xizhen, requested the court to summon Zhu Chizi, the puppet Major General Adjutant of Wang Jingwei, who was in custody, as well as Xia Zhongming and Wu Yu Aizhen, to testify. The court ordered a change of date for further questioning, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Puppet Consul and Opium Dealer: Both to be Sentenced on the 14th</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Jiang Xixi, a Chinese expatriate from Nagasaki, Japan, grew up in Japan and studied business with his father. In January 1942, he joined the puppet consulate in Nagasaki as a clerk. In 1944, he was transferred to the puppet Korean consulate as acting director. Jiang, short in stature and pale in complexion, testified in the High Court this morning that he had graduated from a Japanese elementary school with little knowledge. In the puppet consulate, he only performed tasks such as copying and purchasing, with a monthly salary of 40 yen. The court decided that the verdict in this case would be announced on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Lin Jinyong, suspected of being a traitor, was accused of opening the Xieji Opium Shop and serving as the head of the puppet Yangzhou Anti-Smoking Bureau. The trial in the High Court concluded yesterday and will also be sentenced on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<h3>Sun Shaokang's Traitor Case: Xia Zhongming Questioned</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The case of Sun Shaokang, the former president of the puppet Shanghai District Court, was tried on January 10. The defendant vehemently denied participating in the research association of colleagues from the puppet No. 76 Court. The High Court yesterday summoned Xia Zhongming, the director of the puppet No. 76, who was in custody, for questioning. Xia's complexion was quite plump, and he was wearing a dark blue cloth robe. He testified that Sun Shaokang did not participate in the research association of colleagues from the puppet court. His previous testimony in a certain bureau was obtained through coercion and could not be relied upon. Moreover, the research association of colleagues from the puppet court was canceled shortly after being opposed by Chen Gongbo by order, so it did not do any practical work. After giving testimony, he was ordered to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Puppet Consul and Puppet Township Head: Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years in Prison</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The High Court yesterday sentenced two traitor cases: Jiang Daquan, the puppet consul-in-training at the puppet Korean Busan Consulate, and Qiu Shaoting, the puppet township head of the First Township in the puppet Zhabei District of Shanghai, were each sentenced to two years and six months in prison, deprived of public rights for two years, and their property was confiscated, with the exception of what was deemed necessary for the living expenses of their families.</p>
<h3>Two Henchmen of Gojima Shigeru: Deny Working for the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Xie Wanfang and Yu Cheng were tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being traitors. Xie Wanfang was originally the Deputy Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. After the enemy invaded the concession, he continued to work. In February 1942, he became the Deputy Inspector of the Second Section of the Special High Department of the Puppet Police Department. In June of the same year, he was transferred to the Deputy Inspector of the Criminal Section of the Puppet Hongkou Branch Bureau. Yu Cheng was originally an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. In February 1942, he became the Deputy Inspector of the Second Section of the Special High Department of the Puppet Police Department. Because the section was unique in nature, the office was located at 84 Tongfu Road, and it was responsible for arresting our political workers. It was a secret organization, headed by Gojima Shigeru, the Japanese Criminal Section Chief. The defendants were accused of working exclusively to assassinate and arrest our workers. After the victory, they were arrested by the Shanghai Garrison Command and sent to the High Court for prosecution. When questioned, the defendants claimed that they only worked in the puppet police department for a few months after the enemy entered the concession and then quit. They denied any knowledge of arresting our workers. The court ordered a change of date for further questioning, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Shop Not Yet Opened, Confined First: Discharged Soldier Beaten and Humiliated: Accuses Police Officers of Assault and Petitions the Senate for Relief</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Sang Jinrong, a citizen of Longhua District in this city, requested assistance from the Municipal Senate due to extortion and infringement by Qi Jinliang and other officers of the first section of the police branch bureau in that district in preparation for opening a pawn shop. He requested the Senate to send letters to the competent authorities and the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate to uphold justice and severely punish them according to law. Sang Jinrong's report stated: "I am a discharged soldier and have received a retirement pension thanks to the country's grace. In order to make a living, I intend to open a pawn shop in Longhua Town with friends. While I was preparing, Qi Jinliang, an officer of the first section of the Longhua Police Branch Bureau, came to my place on the 27th of last month to investigate fire prevention and sanitation equipment and demand protection money, making unreasonable demands and demanding 500,000 yuan. Because I had no cash, I only offered a check, but he refused to accept it, saying that it must be paid in cash, and we could not agree. On that day, a plainclothes policeman surnamed Wang, along with four or five unknown plainclothes policemen, forcibly pawned items with handcuffs before the pawn shop was opened. I refused. Then, on the 29th of last month, many local volunteer police officers, including Tang Yugen and Tang Yusheng, swarmed in and forcibly pawned bricks, tiles, broken clothes, shoes, etc. After I politely refused, they dragged me out of the house, punching and kicking me, injuring vital parts. They took me to the police station. At this time, Qi Jinliang took advantage of his position and scolded me loudly, without asking the reason, and allowed the volunteer police to leave. He then arbitrarily deprived me of my freedom until the next morning. While I was in custody, I requested five medical examinations, but they were all rejected. Later, I was fined 2,500 yuan by Guo Zhikai, an officer of the judicial section of the bureau, saying it was because I was operating without a license. My pawn shop was still in the preparatory stage, and the signboard was not hung, nor was it opened for business. There were no pawn tickets or documents, but I was still punished. In addition to filing a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate to request a medical examination and filing a complaint, I am submitting this report to request justice."</p>
<h3>Transportation Companies Appeal for Fairness in Rushing to Transport Rice from the Station</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Ganquan Trade Transportation Company and the Xiexing Gongji Transportation Company had a dispute over rushing to transport goods at the North Station. The North Station has suspended freight transportation since the previous day. Xu Dajun, manager of Ganquan Trade Transportation Company, hosted reporters at Da Sanyuan yesterday afternoon to report on the dispute. He said that Ganquan Company has been transporting goods at the North Station for over 20 years and has a good reputation. It has over 50 workers and transports over 700 items per day for customers. However, Xiexing Gongji Transportation Company has no waybill and has been rushing to transport goods in the past two months. After Ganquan Company takes the customer's goods from the station, Xiexing and its workers would rush to grab them. On the 6th of last month, the two sides had a conflict. The police station intervened and fired shots to quell the situation, but disputes continued to occur at any time after that. At 3:00 p.m. on the 5th, Xiexing was still rushing to transport goods, and the workers on both sides had another major conflict. Wang Baobao and Du Desheng, two workers from Ganquan, were detained by the 8th Precinct of the Railway Bureau Police Department and have not been released yet. The Railway Bureau stipulates that those without a waybill are not allowed to transport goods. Now, Xiexing is repeatedly rushing to transport goods, which greatly hinders legitimate business. Therefore, we appeal to the authorities and impartial individuals to come forward and uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Zhi Jiang Steamer Case: Two Captains May Be Released on Bail</h3>
<p>The two captains in the Zhi Jiang steamer case were detained because the District Prosecutor's Office considered it a case of manslaughter, violating criminal law.

<h3>Professor of Chi-Chee College Accused of Being a Traitor: He Shizhen Provides Favorable Testimony</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Zhang Bingkang, a former French professor at Chi-Chee College, was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. Zhang graduated from Chi-Chee College at an early age and then studied in France. He returned to China in the winter of 1937 and married Xiong Shaoqi, a graduate of Fudan University, in May 1938. He taught at his alma mater, Chi-Chee College, and also served as He Shizhen's private secretary. After the victory, someone reported that Zhang "returned to China with his French wife in 1940 when France was defeated by Germany, approached Li Shiqun, a traitor, organized the Qingxiang Committee in Jiangsu, killed underground workers, the chief of the training department of the Loyal National Salvation Army, Han Jin, and members of the commando team Tang Chuanren, Wang Bin, and Fan Jiahe, and also participated in the work of the traitor Mo Cun's special agent headquarters." Liu, the presiding judge, opened the trial yesterday, and He Shizhen appeared in court to testify, stating that Zhang never left Shanghai during the occupation and had always served as his private secretary. Because Zhang was upright and feared that he had offended someone, he was falsely accused. Zhang's wife, Xiong Shaoqi, was then questioned, and Xiong sobbed and complained of injustice, and presented her early marriage certificate, photographs, and Chi-Chee College appointment letter. The lawyers Shan Yuhua and Ge Bangzhen then defended her. The court ordered that the trial of this case be concluded and the verdict announced on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<h3>Social Services, Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>Buying and Selling Marriage</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Shichang asks: When my relative was sixteen years old, his mother arranged for a child bride. The girl's brother and a neighbor acted as matchmakers. After she entered the family, we discovered that she was temperamental and of low character. It seems impossible to live together in old age. I gently advised him, but unexpectedly, she became angry and left, never to return. Later, the man asked a third party to request the dissolution of the marriage from the girl's mother, but it was not accepted. I ask: (1) The husband is now an adult, but the other party is still a minor. How should he proceed to dissolve the marriage contract? (2) The engagement of a child bride is decided by the parents of both parties, but without the consent of the individuals involved. Is it legally valid? (3) If the woman does not agree to dissolve the marriage contract, what should the man do? (4) Can the man claim compensation from the woman for all the expenses incurred during the engagement? (5) Can the woman accuse the man of any crime?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) (2) A marriage contract not entered into by the parties themselves is legally invalid. (3) A unilateral procedure to dissolve the marriage contract is of course invalid. (4) (5) No.</p>
<p>Overstepping One's Bounds</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Jun asks: When Miss A was three years old, her parents arranged for her to be betrothed to Mr. B through a matchmaker and accepted a deposit of ten yuan. However, no engagement ceremony was held. Now the woman is nineteen years old and very dissatisfied with this marriage contract, but she does not understand the legal regulations and dares not act rashly. Your newspaper has always been enthusiastic in serving the public and resolving doubts. Please answer the following questions: (1) Is this marriage contract valid? (2) Can Miss A publish a statement in the newspaper denying the marriage contract? (3) What will happen if the other party responds? (4) Does Miss A have to compensate for any losses? (5) Does the ten-yuan deposit have any bearing on this marriage contract? (6) What are the steps to resolve this marriage contract? (7) If the woman does not dissolve this marriage contract, can she become engaged and married to another man?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) This marriage contract is invalid. (2) (3) There is no need to publish a denial in the newspaper because the marriage contract is legally invalid from the beginning. (4) She is not liable for any compensation. (5) This deposit is not related to the marriage contract. (6) No procedures are required. (7) It does not constitute bigamy.</p>
<h3>Mail on Behalf Of</h3>
<p>To Messrs. Ye Desheng, Jiang Zengxi, and Zou Zhaolin, four gentlemen whose names are not given, regarding the conclusion of the "Emergency Relief Fund" of this newspaper:</p>
<p>Gentlemen: We were previously entrusted by you to handle the emergency relief fund. Starting from September 25th and ending on December 25th, lasting three months, thanks to the cooperative efforts of seven hospitals, including Guangci, Renji, Gongji, the Red Cross, the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, the Municipal Second Hospital, and the Municipal Fourth Hospital, the results were satisfactory.

<h3>Rumors of Loose Monetary Policy Abound, Gold Price Breaks Through Five Million, US Dollar Soars 1,200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in gold prices became unstoppable. With monetary policy reportedly loosening and few sellers, new buyers advanced easily and fearlessly, creating new highs. However, after reaching high prices, many sold off, leading to a volatile market. The morning opened at 4.82 million to 4.84 million, and immediately rose. Initially, the rise was relatively steady, but after 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 460 bars at a price of 4.95 million, immediately pushing the price to break through the 5 million mark. Many short positions were automatically closed, briefly lowering the price to 4.91 million. However, the downward correction did not change the overall trend. The 5 million mark was eventually broken through, attracting new buyers and accelerating the upward momentum, reaching a high of 5.22 million. Some still took profits, causing a slight drop back to below 5.1 million around noon, but the price still stood at around 5.15 million at lunchtime. In the afternoon, trading continued and fell back to 5.07 million. Next-day transactions still showed bullishness. Rumors abounded in the market, pushing the price to a new high of 5.33 million, before a pullback. However, even after the market closed, there were still high bids, resulting in a net increase of 440,000 yuan compared to the previous close. Ornaments were listed at 550,000 yuan. Silver dollars continued to strengthen. The underground interest rates remained loose, with interest rates only around 1.5 jiao. Foreign currencies followed the gold market, with the US dollar opening at 9,200 to 9,400 in the morning, fluctuating upwards, and finally breaking through the 10,000 yuan mark at lunchtime. In the afternoon, the trend continued to be bullish, reaching a new high price and closing near 10,500 yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of 1,200 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong notes were particularly bullish, repeatedly jumping from 1,800 yuan to over 2,000 yuan, also increasing by 200 yuan. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 1,900 to 1,920 yuan, the Indian exchange rate was 2,320 to 2,340 yuan, and the British exchange rate was around 30,500 yuan. There were more transactions in Hong Kong exchange rates, with few supplies for the rest.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Executive Committee Resolves to Establish Seventeen Subgroups, Chairpersons of Each Group Already Appointed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held its first formal meeting at the Central Bank on February 7th at 4:00 PM, after several preparatory meetings. Chairman Bei Zuyi, Committee Members Liu Gongyun, Jin Shixuan, Lin Fengbao, Shen Xirui, etc., all attended. The secretariat of the committee also announced its establishment on the third floor of the Bank of China building on the same day. Secretariat Director Shen Xirui (Deputy Director of the Central Trust Bureau) has already taken office.

The various committees and consultants will preside over them separately. A financial subcommittee will also be established, chaired by Committee Member Lin Fengbao. A transportation subcommittee, chaired by Committee Member Jin Shixuan, will be convened separately within the month to discuss and actively promote exports.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to our reporter's investigation: In addition to the financial and transportation subcommittees, the other seventeen trade subcommittees will be chaired by: Lin Fengbao for the first and fifth groups. Yang Xiren for the second, seventh, and thirteenth groups. Zhang Silu for the third group. Central Bank consultant Mike for the fourth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and sixteenth groups. Shen Xirui for the twelfth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and seventeenth groups.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Rise</h3>
<p>Public bonds also rose yesterday. The unified bonds opened at 2,050 yuan in the morning. Bids were made for the 550, 360 series, pushing the price up to 2,350 yuan. Before closing, the price fluctuated between 2,250 yuan and 2,300 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 200 yuan for classes A and B, 250 yuan for E, and 300 yuan for classes C and D. The transaction volume was approximately 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>White Paper to be Listed as a "Production Enterprise" and Approved for Unrestricted Import</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of white paper in this city has been surprisingly high amid rumors of foreign exchange adjustments. It is said that the relevant authorities will approve white paper imports to be listed under the "production enterprise" category and allow unrestricted import to meet the needs of the national cultural industry. The market price of white paper may stabilize in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk Goods All Improve, Artificial Silk Especially Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as gold and banknotes rose in the market, silk goods generally improved, especially artificial silk, which rose most sharply. After 120 gold three-horse Yukwang changed hands at 4.58 million yuan per 61 boxes in the morning, it rose gradually and continuously, reaching 5 million yuan at the close at noon. In the afternoon, it was bid up another 200,000 yuan, resulting in a rise of slightly less than 700,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, because the bidding price soared in the market yesterday, buyers hesitated, and transactions were very scarce. The price of 75 semi-gloss was bid at 7 million yuan, which can be described as "rare things are expensive." The reason for the continuous rise in recent days is simply because silk factories have started work. Some of the raw materials were mortgaged with production loans last winter and cannot be used, and the procedures for the materials issued by the silk joint venture have not been completed. This has forced some manufacturers to search for goods on the black market, and holders have seized on this weakness, taking advantage of the rising gold and banknotes to opportunistically push up prices. However, once the materials are processed and the allocation is sold as usual, there will be a possibility of price declines. Yesterday, the factory bid prices also increased in the morning, but there were few transactions. In the afternoon, as the price of gold rose again, there was a slight demand. D-grade goods were priced at 5.9 million yuan, a sharp increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Ordinary goods and dry silk were bid up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Affected by the high prices of raw materials, factory prices for all types of silk goods increased due to cost reasons. Yesterday, the transaction price of Mayar bedcovers in the morning was 3.55 million yuan, and in the afternoon, the outside market bid up 150,000 yuan for sale. Large Chen Gezi fabrics were in high demand, and local silk stores competed to purchase them. The price in the morning was 14,500 yuan, and in the afternoon, the outside market bid 5,000 yuan. Juxi crepe was priced at 4,000 yuan in the morning and bid at 4,200 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rose again. Cantonese merchants were very active, and heavy double-horse yarns set a new high price of 4.25 million yuan. Ordinary 20-count cotton yarn also followed, rising by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. 32-count and 42-count twisted fine yarns rose wildly by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan due to factory purchases. The closing trend was still bullish, and market sentiment was firm.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the cotton cloth market, fine cloth was rarely traded in the market because of the flat price, but the market atmosphere outside the market was quite lively. Yanghe fine cloth rose by 8,500 yuan per bolt. Prices of other fabrics such as AAA Caiqiu Wufu and Longtou cloth also rose by 5,000 yuan to 7,000 yuan. Dark blue Shilin cloth was affected by the fine cloth market, and factory prices increased. Traders rushed to buy it. Anan blue cloth rose sharply by 40,000 to 70,000 yuan per bolt. Poplin rose again by 5,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton market was firm. Guoguang Yarn Factory purchased 100 bales of Bailuoqu cotton flowers, and the price delivered to the factory was 495,000 yuan. There were not many transactions between traders, and market sentiment was bullish.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Emphatically States: Siamese Rice Supplies Unlimited, Negotiated Prices Not Allowed to Change</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu stated to reporters yesterday afternoon regarding the rice issue: The government's massive sale of Siamese rice and strict crackdown on merchants who violate negotiated prices could have resolved the rice market price surge within this week, but the impact of rising gold prices has caused some setbacks. In any case, it is hoped that prices can be suppressed next week. Recently, one or two hundred rice boats have arrived on the Suzhou Creek, and they seem to be observing the situation to see if the government will adjust negotiated prices. I have also recently received letters from citizens stating that "cheap grain harms farmers," indicating that the government's suppression of rice prices has caused significant losses to farmers. What I want to clarify now is that the government allows rice prices to follow other commodity prices, but not to exceed other commodity prices. According to the current black market calculations, it has already exceeded the price of other commodities, so we must suppress it. Even if not a single grain of white rice comes to this city in the future, the current stock of Siamese rice can last until the end of August. Therefore, the municipal government remains committed to: (1) Unlimited supply of Siamese rice, (2) White rice can be sold within the negotiated price of 76,000 yuan, (3) No plans to adjust the negotiated prices at this time.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Violating Negotiated Prices to be Punished by the Social Affairs Bureau According to Law</p>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South rice markets had a total of approximately 500 shi of goods arriving. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell Siamese rice, with 4,195 bags sold in the North Market and 1,750 bags in the South Market, totaling 5,945 bags. Regarding merchants violating the negotiated price of white rice, the bureau yesterday also continued to investigate and discovered 23 more firms, bringing the total to 101, including the previous 78. Among them, the black market price was as high as 100,000 yuan. Some are repeat offenders. The Social Affairs Bureau has drafted punishment measures, which are reportedly: warnings will be issued for those below 90,000 yuan. For those above 90,000 yuan, account books or other evidence will be confiscated, and fines will be imposed separately in accordance with Articles 2 and 6 of the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and Negotiated Prices. The amounts will be submitted to the municipal government for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>Merchants Unable to Make Profit, White Rice Disappears from Market</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Because the authorities are determined to suppress rice prices and will not allow renegotiating agreed prices, it is nearly impossible to buy white rice in this city. According to rice merchants, the market price of white rice in Wuxi is 80,000 yuan, and the rice prices in other counties are also between 70,000 and 80,000 yuan. Shipping it to Shanghai would cost at least 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Since the negotiated rice prices in this city are lower than the rice prices in other cities, merchants cannot make a profit and naturally will not ship rice to Shanghai. Recently, the authorities have been strictly investigating rice store inventories, so most rice stores sell small amounts of white rice in mixtures, and black market transactions are gradually decreasing. The North and South markets have formed a single-color Siamese rice trading environment. Although white rice has been shipped to the Suzhou Creek, it is all waiting for a reply and will not be easily sold. Therefore, whether rice prices in this city can be fully suppressed, the level of rice prices in the suburbs is also a determining factor.</p>
<p>The Markets for Coarse Grains and Bean Cakes are Buoyant</p>
<p>The source of soybeans is still scarce, and oil plants and wood have a very strong appetite, and the price is sharply rising, advancing by 2,300 yuan. Bean cake owners are very firm, and customer acceptance is still acceptable, advancing by another 1,3500 yuan at a high price. Qingdao already has spot goods in the oil market, and the market sentiment is somewhat uncertain, the shop sentiment has turned weak, and various oils have fallen across the board by 35,000 yuan. The air is still strong, and the flour market has risen by 500-1,000 yuan. The skin of the wheat is very popular in Zhejiang, and the villages are slightly encouraged, the market is lively, and it has rebounded by 1,000 yuan. The high price of raw kernels is fixed, and the secondary transit is acceptable, and it has risen by 2,300 yuan. Sesame is up, corn is fixed, red sorghum is outstanding, wheat is stable, red beans have risen by 34,000 yuan, and lentil beans are imitated, and green beans are firm.</p>
<h3>Black Market Prices for Sugar Soar, Mayor Wu Orders Taiwan Sugar Corporation to Restrict Arbitrary Allocation Requests from Merchants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The allocation price of raw sugar and red sugar had just been adjusted by the Review Committee from 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per dan a few days ago. The black market price has risen repeatedly in recent days, reaching its peak yesterday. Mayor Wu issued a statement yesterday afternoon regarding this matter: Merchants applied for a total of only 11,000 tons of allocated sugar from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation last month. Now, seeing the high black market price, they applied for 12,000 tons of allocated sugar in the first week of this month. Merchants' concept of valuing profits so highly is truly inappropriate. An order has been issued to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to allocate all applicants for the month based on last month's standards. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau has been ordered to closely monitor black market sugar prices. We hope that merchants will not deliberately raise prices or hoard goods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sugar market trend was still tight yesterday. The guild's quoted spot price for refined sugar was 175,000 to 200,000 yuan, up another 45,000 yuan. Raw sugar red sugar was 163,000 yuan. Numbered goods were offered by Cantonese merchants, with Shunde Qing at 125,000 to 6,000 yuan, and Shantou offered 126,000 yuan, totaling more than 300 bags. The Xinghua gang offered Xinghua foreign for 30 bags, at 145,000 yuan, and Xinxing red at 145,000 to 138,000 yuan, totaling more than 400 baskets. Jianbang Diao Qing was initially 118,000 yuan, then 120,000 to 122,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Negotiated Prices for Sugar and Cotton Cloth, Extraordinary Meeting to be Held Today</h3>

<h3>Allocation of Oil Materials to be Handled by the Transportation Management Committee</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has determined that since the Temporary Import Management Committee has been established, the authority to set prices and distribute oil materials should be transferred to the committee. The China Petroleum Corporation, which previously managed this work, has been ordered to abolish the Oil Material Allocation Committee it had established. After receiving the order, the company immediately sent personnel to contact Li, the Executive Member of the Transportation Management Committee, to handle the handover. It is understood that in addition to approving oil prices, the committee plans to establish a separate agency to manage the allocation of oil materials. However, the work of transporting oil to other cities will still be carried out jointly with the Petroleum Corporation. The distribution of oil and materials purchased by government agencies under special projects and oil materials produced by the Gansu Oil Administration Bureau's Kaohsiung Refinery will still be managed by the Petroleum Corporation.</p>
<h3>Treasury Bills</h3>
<p>Market Rumors Abound, Central Bank Claims They are False</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] With gold and banknotes soaring in recent days, the market has been rife with rumors that the Central Bank will issue treasury bills. Yesterday, our reporter inquired with Liang Ping, Director of the Issuing Bureau of the bank, about the details. He replied that he knew nothing about this matter and stated that all the rumors were false. He further clarified that even the new version of the gold banknotes issued during the Lunar New Year were not numerous and were issued purely to meet the needs of various sectors. Therefore, an application is still required for exchange. Recently, due to extremely limited reserves, there have been restrictions on exchanges.</p>

<h3>Morning Friends Cup Basketball Tournament Successfully Concludes; Morning White Wins Group A Championship; Defeats Morning Red in Second Final Last Night; New Life Defeats Morning Blue in Group B Final</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The finals of the 6th Changyou Cup basketball tournament, organized by the Morning Friends Group of the YMCA, were held last night in the Zhongqing Gymnasium in Baxianqiao. Over a thousand spectators attended, making it an unprecedented event in the small Zhongqing basketball hall. In the Group B final, New Life, which defeated the Sixth Division Team, competed against Morning Blue. As a result, New Life defeated Morning Blue 19-13 to win the Group B championship. In the Group A second final, the Morning Friends Red and White teams, which are brothers, fought each other for the second time. As a result, the White team defeated the Red team again 59-33 to win the Group A championship. The battle situation is described below:</p>
<p>New Life Wins Group B Championship</p>
<p>In the first scene, the New Life and Morning Friends Blue teams competed in the Group B final. New Life was indeed "new life," more lively, younger, and willing to fight than Morning Blue. After the start of the game, both sides were highly concentrated and the defense was extremely strict, so the scores were low. In the first half, New Life led 9-6. After switching sides, Liang Xiong of New Life scored the first bullseye again. Chen Weiyuan of Morning Blue made a long shot, and Yuan Peiyuan also made two free throws. However, Tong Yanxuan and Liang Xiong of New Life teamed up, and Morning Blue could not do anything about it. As a result, New Life won the championship 19-13.</p>
<p>Brotherly Confrontation Especially Tense</p>
<p>The final battle was the second final of Group A, the Morning Friends Red and White brothers confronting each other. Outside rumors said that the Red and White brothers were a family. Last night, before the game, they understood each other. Red wins, White loses, but the result is that the championship still belongs to the White team. The battle was especially tense, resulting in numerous fouls. The White team was the embodiment of benevolence. When the whistle blew, they couldn't get anything in seven minutes of melee. He Zeng of the Red team opened the record with a single-handed goal. Wu Xinyun of the White team attacked desperately and scored two points in a row. Bao Daohui added fuel to the fire, and the White team took the lead 13-6. Huang Cunrui of the Red team made a long shot from the center line several times, but failed to score, and the morale declined, and the movements gradually became clumsy. Wu Xinyun of the White team was injured and fell to the ground, and Shen Pengju replaced him. In the first half, the Red team was behind 15-25.</p>
<p>White Team Wins Red Two Battles, Two Wins</p>
<p>After switching sides, Wu Xinyun of the White team re-entered the battle. The guard Sun Guozheng intensified his efforts to rush forward and block, putting on a show. The Red team only had Huang Cunrui's long shots and Wang Rongsheng and Shi Jiuquan's slight embellishments. The White team's score soared with Yao Wenyi's holding the ball, Shen Pengju's rushing forward, and Wang Huaiting's long shots, reaching 52-33. Yao Wenyi took the opportunity to score three more points, and Wu Xinyun added icing on the cake. The bell rang loudly, 59-33. The White team won two battles in a row and won the Morning Friends Cup Group A championship.</p>

<h3>Dedication</h3>
<p>This page is not only a short history of the development of a national goods factory, but also the arduous and striving process of the entire Chinese national industry.</p>
<p>Yumin Woolen Yarn Factory has been established for ten years. What a great era these ten years have been! The motherland's Anti-Japanese War has finally achieved victory. Yumin Factory was destroyed at the beginning of its establishment, just as the incident began. But its leaders were unyielding, rebuilt the foundation in the isolated island of the turbid current, and strived for a broad future for the national industry. When the Pacific War broke out, the entire Shanghai market fell, and the enemy and puppets frantically squeezed everything. In this darkest moment, it was willing to shut down and refused to cooperate with the enemy and puppets. After the victory, it raised its head again and took on the task of revitalizing the country and building the industry. Isn't this the epitome of all loyal and unwavering national goods factories?</p>
<p>To commemorate this great decade, we hope that in the next decade, we will work hard to make China's national industry thrive day by day, keep pace with the world's advanced countries, and complete the most important task of the construction era.</p>
<h3>Ten Years of Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>Our company was established in May of the 26th year of the Republic of China [1937], with a capital of 350,000 [currency not specified]. We purchased more than 16 mu of factory land at the intersection of Jinyi Road and Longhua Road, and ordered the latest woolen spinning machines from the United Kingdom. The construction of the factory building began, but less than two months later, the August 13th Incident occurred, and the construction project was halted. Moreover, the location was near the military area, and it was impossible to send personnel to guard it, so the completed walls and other projects were completely destroyed. By the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939], we had separately surveyed the current factory site (142 Xinhui Road), rented land and built houses, installed machines, and immediately started work, persevering and striving for the national goods industry. Later, feeling that the funds were insufficient, we increased the capital twice in the 29th and 30th years of the Republic of China [1940 and 1941] to 1.1 million [currency not specified]. All changes were reported to and registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All of our products, including Double Ocean Brand, Double Hand Brand, Eagle Brand, and Globe Brand coarse and fine woolen yarn, were sold to various ports and were well received, with demand exceeding supply. Our company became more motivated, studied carefully, and strived to make progress. Soon, the Pacific War broke out, the source of wool tops was blocked, and work was halted. At that time, the flames of the enemy were spreading, coveting the factory's assets. Monsters and demons used their usual tricks, threatening and tempting, using both soft and hard tactics. Our company remained unmoved, always strictly adhered to its position, adhered to the spirit of preferring to be a broken jade than a complete tile, and resolutely refused to the end. In order to protect the funds, we returned the funds to the shareholders twice, as an expedient measure to cope with the then environment, to ease our burdens, and to wait for the arrival of Su. Since the victory was realized the previous autumn, factories in Shanghai have resumed work one after another. Our company has regrouped, increased its capital to 1 billion [currency not specified], expanded production, and strived to revitalize the industry, hoping to contribute a small amount to the cause of national construction and revival.</p>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>It is reported that the company will hold a grand 10th anniversary celebration with solemn ceremonies. The invitations issued are all accompanied by admission tickets. Guests must enter with tickets. The venue is limited, and in order to maintain order, one ticket per person, and no admission without a ticket.</p>

<h3>Earth and Double Ocean</h3>
<p>Earth, people all over the world live on earth, people cannot leave the earth, the earth is spinning every day, every minute and every second is spinning, it promotes the era, and gradually improves people's lives. The prosperity of science and the innovation of thought are all due to the innate abilities of people on earth. Yumin Globe Brand woolen yarn uses the earth as a trademark, its meaning is not only to hope to promote this beautiful product to the whole earth, but in fact it has the alert that the lives of people on earth should be new and new every day, so the Globe Brand is a broad commodity, it can be in this corner of the earth. Enjoyed a great reputation, it is a matter of course.</p>
<p>As for the double ocean, in the past China, which was based on silver, silver ocean coins were valued by everyone. Silver is a pure color, it has brilliance, but it does not have the vulgarity of gold, it is very simple and very cute. Yumin's Double Ocean yarn with the Double Ocean as its trademark, on the one hand, expresses its brilliance, and on the other hand, it means that it is spread among the people.</p>
<p>The same is the trademark, which should be both elegant and popular, and the meaning should be profound. The meaning of the trademarks of Globe Brand yarn and Double Ocean Brand yarn are clear, and its sales will naturally go without saying!</p>

<h3>The Importance of "Oiling" in Wool Spinning Engineering</h3>
<p>— Sheng Wei</p>
<p>After the raw wool used in wool spinning has been washed once in the wool washing process, most of the original wool grease attached to the wool fibers has been washed away, leaving only 1-3% of the oil content on it, and the surface of the wool fibers becomes rough after being subjected to soap and alkaline substances, and it also loses its original softness. If such wool fibers are put into the various spinning processes, the fibers will inevitably be broken and damaged due to mutual friction through multiple mechanical operations, resulting in a defective product. In the spinning engineering, the only way to remedy this problem is to apply a so-called "oiling" process.</p>
<p>After the wool fibers have been subjected to the "oiling" process, the advantages of its technology and products are briefly described below:</p>
<p>1. Reduce the frictional resistance between fibers in various spinning preparation processes such as Carding, Gilling, and Cornbing, so that the fibers reduce the rate of breakage and damage.</p>
<p>2. Make Cornbing and Drafting easier to operate and increase the elasticity of fibers in roving.</p>
<p>3. Prevent the fibers from flying around during spinning and reduce the consumption of waste.</p>
<p>Secondly, choosing the oil quality used for "oiling" is also an important matter. The following points are the conditions for checking the oil quality and are also worth studying.</p>
<p>1. It can easily expand on the surface of each fiber, so that there is a kind of lubricity between the fibers, which can reduce its frictional resistance, prevent the generation of static electricity, help the stretching effect, and reduce the discount of falling wool and flying wool.</p>
<p>2. It is stable in the atmosphere and does not cause chemical reactions, is non-coloring, and does not damage the fibers and the mechanical needle cloth, etc.</p>
<p>3. It is easy to emulsify and can be stabilized in spinning without coagulation, no volatilization phenomenon, and no bad odor remains on the product and is easy to wash.</p>
<p>4. High ignition point, the fibers after "oiling" have no danger of spontaneous combustion.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned regulations, olive oil is the most suitable among the oils, so it has always been used as the best raw material for "oiling." Because the value of this kind of oil is too high, other mineral oils or vegetable oils have recently been used instead, but when using high-grade raw materials to manufacture high-grade products, olive oil is still used.</p>
<p>Because the raw materials are different, such as coarse wool, fine wool, waste wool, and silk wool, the amount of oil applied is of course also different. Depending on the type of wool, an appropriate amount of oil is injected. The general amount of oil injected is:</p>
<p>About 0.5-5% for combing, about 3-15% for spinning woolen yarn, and 20% for short wool fibers that have undergone carbonization work.</p>
<p>Before applying the oil, it is more economical and the surface of the fibers is also easier to expand evenly if hot water is added to the oil and stirred to make it milky white before spraying it on the wool.</p>
<p>According to the research of many famous spinning experts, the yarn spun from spinning raw materials that have been subjected to "oiling" work can be increased by 8-10's. From this, we can know that if you want to spin high-quality and fine products, you must not neglect the "oiling" work.</p>
<h3>Saving Dyes and Improving Colors</h3>
<p>— Dingdong</p>
<p>The main purpose of dyeing is how to dye the finished product into bright colors at the lowest cost. Although its brightness has a direct relationship with the dye itself, according to my experience, it can also be improved by the following two methods:</p>
<p>1. The combination of dyes should not exceed four types. The more types, the easier it is for the dyed finished product to turn gray.</p>
<p>2. Apply the original dye liquor for dyeing. Ordinary water often contains a small amount of calcium salts, which make the dyed color slightly darker. If the original dye liquor is applied, this disadvantage can be avoided. It can not only make the color brighter, but also save dyes, fuel, acid, sodium sulfate, and water consumption. The cost of finished products can be reduced.</p>
<p>The above two methods are very easy to implement. The second method is slightly more difficult: because the dye components in the dye liquor are not easy to measure, the color of the finished product cannot be consistent, and the color is not easy to be uniform and becomes mottled. Therefore, dyeing with the original dye liquor should choose raw materials with good dyeing properties. As for measuring the remaining dye components in the dye liquor, the following two methods can be used for measurement:</p>
<p>1. Suppose 3% of the required dye liquor is poured into the test cup, add 4% sulfuric acid and 20% sodium sulfate, and add water to make the total amount 30 c.c. Take out 25 c.c., set aside, and dye the sample in the usual way. After dyeing, squeeze dry, and add water to make the dye liquor to the original 27.5 c.c. Take out a part and put it in a colorimetric tube, and at the same time take out 1 c.c. from the previous 25 c.c. of liquid and put it in a graduated colorimetric tube, dilute it with water so that its color is the same as the liquid in the other colorimetric tube. Assuming that 1 c.c. of undyed liquid needs to be added with 8.5 c.c. of water to be the same as the dyed liquid, the dye stolen in the period liquid (1+8.5=0.12) is 12%, and the sample absorbs 80% as the dye.</p>
<p>2. Add 2% sulfuric acid and dye that makes the color the same as the previous sample in the dye liquor that has been dyed in the first method. If the amount of dye liquor added is 2.6%, then the remaining dye component in the original dye liquor is 13.33% (2.6+3×100), and the sample is absorbed by 86.66%.</p>
<p>The results of these two tests are very similar; however, the first method is more accurate. As for acid mordant dyes, the colors before and after dyeing are completely different; therefore, the second method is more appropriate. As for the measurement of the blended dye liquor, the principle is the same as above, and the reader will be able to apply it by analogy, so I will not repeat it here.</p>

<h3>I Talk About Woolen Yarn Knitting</h3>
<p>— ……Feng Qiuping……</p>
<p>The invention of woolen yarn knitting, in European and American countries, has already published knitting samples as one of the ways to promote handicrafts. Looking at our country, there are few knitting researchers. You must know that woolen yarn clothing is soft and comfortable, and both outer wear and inner wear are very suitable. It is actually the chief of clothing, and it is suitable for people of all classes. Although Europe and the United States have long created various styles of knitting, they are only suitable for foreigners to wear. Ping has learned from this, so she has devoted herself to researching various woolen yarn clothing that is suitable for Chinese people to wear; and also to promote business in the woolen yarn industry, to provide women with more opportunities. The relationship between woolen yarn and knitting is like siblings. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Ping had already compiled the various patterns of woolen yarn clothing that she had researched on a daily basis, and titled it Qiuping Woolen Yarn Embroidery Knitting Method, and had also given lectures on the airwaves at the radio station, so that ladies who love knitting in other cities could also have the opportunity to study. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. Woolen yarn has been controlled, and I have to temporarily retire. After the victory, I am in the midst of shouting for national construction. Women should seek self-reliance. Woolen yarn knitting is a noble art, and it should be further developed to give women more occupations. Among the domestic woolen yarn, Earth and Double Ocean are the two kinds of autumn ping have been used for many years, the quality can be called first-class, today is the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Shanghai Yumin Woolen Yarn Factory, I would like to solemnly introduce it to all circles.</p>
<p>Don't say the business is light as a feather The success is now ten years and eight years The enemy soldiers come Ever not stained Pure and upright, strong and firm Holding this thousands of threads, think about the meaning, often looking at the name Not seeking thick I am to enrich the people's livelihood</p>

<h3>絨線的常識</h3>
<p>— 學智</p>
<p>編結絨線製品在我們的「衣」的一項中，已經佔有極其重要的地位了。 最大的優點，就是毫無浪費，即使破舊，仍可拆了重新編結；其次就是應用很廣：無論男女老幼，身上一切衣著：如帽子，圍巾，內衣，外套，褲子，手套及鞋襪等，無不相宜。此外，利用絨線編結毯子，及刺繡等裝飾品，也極合宜，這一點，在歐美早已很普遍地在通行了。至於柔軟舒適，經久耐用，已經盡人皆知，毋須贅述。</p>
<p>不過，一樣是絨線，也大有好壞；除了羊毛本身品質上，有優劣分別外，在紡製技術上，更有粗細是否均勻，寬緊是否適度，色澤是否光潔鮮豔，分量是否準確充足等條件，也很重要的。</p>
<p>所以，當你選購絨線的時候，必須注意上列各點。比方說：太寬鬆的絨線，結成衣服之後，就要起毛球，太緊呢，又要發硬，沒有彈性。</p>
<p>地球牌絨線和雙洋牌絨線，已具備了上述標準條件；今天是它們問世十週年紀念，也就是說：它們是有十年歷史的老牌絨線了。</p>
<p>關於絨線洗滌的時候，也有幾點應當注意，（一）不要把肥皂擦在絨線上，必須先泡成肥皂水，然後將絨線浸入，（二）溫度不要太高，（三）不要用手搓擦， 應輕輕漂洗，（四）不可用手絞，由水中提起讓它自然晾乾，（六）勿在强烈日光下 曝曬。</p>
<p>至於貯藏絨線的時候，要注意到是否完全乾透。防蛀品如樟腦等當然是不可少的。</p>

<h3>關於文天祥二三事</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>小引</p>
<p>人生自古誰無死，</p>
<p>留取丹心照汗青！</p>
<p>世事變動正急，無聊的事情太多，於是從書架上取下史書來消磨寒冷。讀「宋史」及「文文山集」，不禁大有所感。當文天祥從北營逃亡之際，進退狼狽，無知之徒，竟然把他當作北方人的奸細。一代忠良，被誣陷到如此地步，怎能不令人浩歎！由此可知事理不明，忠奸不分，自古以來就是如此，並非始於今日。幸而歷史留下記載，光明磊落，永不磨滅，所謂「留取丹心照汗青」，天祥真有先見之明啊！</p>
<p>於是選擇其中二三事，兼參考其他書籍，寫成此文，並非為了表彰，只是聊供消遣。古人說：百無一用是書生。書生無用，也不是從今日開始，今為此不急之務，是否也屬於無用的表現，我自己也不知道了。</p>
<p>謹錄為序，以冠全文。</p>
<p>十二義士考</p>
<p>當臨安被元兵攻破，天祥正擔任左丞相，奉命前往敵營。敵人於是把他留下，解往北方。到了京口，依靠杜滸等人的幫助，用盡智力，歷經危險，終於得以脫逃。這次一同逃出虎口的，共有十二人，我們稱之為十二義士。後來這十二個人，在經過千辛萬苦後，有四人中途逃避，所以只剩下八人。但逃離的四人，雖有始無終，然而死裡求生，也是人之常情，不過比不上其他八人的意志堅定，始終如一罷了。就事論事，終究還勝過那些遇敵就投降的人萬倍。但這十二個人的姓名，除了杜滸外，知道的人卻很少。現在把他們逐一敘述，即使不詳盡描繪，或許竟無事蹟可見，但流芳百世，只要留下姓名也就足夠，事蹟是否被湮沒本來就不足輕重。</p>
<p>這十二個人的姓名是：杜滸，金應，張慶，夏仲，呂武，王青，鄒捷，余元慶，李茂，吳亮和蕭發。杜滸的姓名見於正史，略而不詳，但天祥「指南錄」詩序中記載他的事極多。天祥被擄後得以脫逃，倘若沒有他，簡直不可能成為事實。「文丞相督府忠義傳」所載，比較首尾完備，現在引用在下面：</p>
<p>杜滸字貴卿，號梅 坡，天台人，游俠於臨安。及臨安危急，糾合義兵四千人，當權者不理會。二年正月十三日，見丞相於西湖上，丞相獎勵稱異。丞相出使北營，滸竭力爭論不可前往，陳志道驅逐他離去。丞相北行，眾賓客沒有人敢跟隨，滸慨然請求前往。丞相在鎮江脫逃，是滸的功勞啊……等到輔佐行府於南劍州，派遣往溫台招募兵士籌集錢財。福安陷落，滸奔赴行朝，奉朝廷命令返回行府。江西戰敗，又一起跋涉危險艱難的境地一年多。等到 崖山崩潰，滸被俘至廣州，貧病交加，面無人色，不久去世。</p>
<p>在十二人中，他是唯一智勇雙全的人！</p>
<p>金應姓名也見於正史，也是隨同天祥出使北方而後一同回來的一人，「指南錄」有「哭金路分應」一詩序，寫道：</p>
<p>金應以使者身份往來我處二十年，性情剛烈且知義理，不做卑劣的事情。去年跟隨我勤王，補授兩武資。今年春天，授承信郎，東南第六正將，駐紮贛州……我北行之時，人情莫不觀望，僚屬跟從的人都散去，即使是親近的僕人也逃走了，唯有金應上下相隨，經歷各種險難，奔波數千里，認為理所當然。大概是委身以從，生死休戚，都與我同為一體的人。至通州，住了十多天，五月初五，忽然臥病不起……命令治療三四次，熱病更加嚴重（五月六日，一更二更），至十一日中午氣絕。我哭他哭得很痛。為他殮葬，用的是隨身衣物。棺木如常。第二天，葬在西門雪窖邊。棺木之上，排列七個小釘子，又用一小塊木板覆蓋於七個釘子之上，作為記號。不敢要求完備，邊境城池無人主持，恐怕留下身後的禍患。異時路過方便，取回他的骨骸歸葬廬陵，然後死者才能瞑目啊。悲傷啊！悲傷啊！</p>
<p>其人也不亞於杜滸，可惜於中途喪亡，使天祥失去一個好助手！</p>
<p>張慶官拜虞侯，也見於正史，其他事蹟都不太可考，僅在「指南錄」「高沙道中」序中有寫道：</p>
<p>早晨在霧中行走，無法辨認方向，必須等到四山 辨明，忽然 看見北方騎兵。道路有竹林，趕緊進入躲避。不久，二十多騎兵 在竹林旁呼喊喧鬧，虞侯張慶右眼內中一箭，脖子上兩刀，割了他的喉嚨，裸露於地……又「至高沙」後跋中有寫道：</p>
<p>我至高沙，對奸細的 提防非常嚴格。當時我用 竹子做轎子，見者憐憫。又看張慶血流滿面，衣衫都被污染，人們都知道是遇見北兵，不再懷疑是奸細……</p>
<p>此後他是否跟隨天祥渡海，下文從此沒有提起，我們當然無從知道了。</p>
<p>夏仲是天祥的親隨。當天祥在高沙道中遇敵，他因分散躲避而倖免，事蹟也見於「高沙道中」序中。此外別無記載，大約是因為只是一個僕人，沒有其他的功業，所以也沒有人注意他了。</p>
<p>呂武跟隨天祥逃脫時，官任總轄，所以他的事蹟較為可考。「文丞相督府忠義傳」中有他的傳記，「文山集」卷十六「集杜詩」中「呂武第一百一十三」有序，所記較詳，茲據以錄入。序中寫道：</p>
<p>環衛官呂武，太平人，以面旗為軍隊標誌，我陷入敵手，他應募隨從我北行。其人剛勁勇猛，當面責備人，觸犯忌諱也不迴避。然而忠誠耿直，人們都佩服他。我與他一同在鎮江脫逃，行走淮東，患難之中賴以自壯。等到在南劍州開府，派他聯絡江淮義軍。道路受阻，呂武歷經數千里，找到我於汀梅。挺身攻打賊寨，化賊為兵。正要率領數千人出江西，因為對待士大夫無禮，遭到橫禍而死。死的那天，一軍都為他流淚，可悲啊！</p>
<p>王青為 步兵，事蹟也無從考證。「高沙道中」序中有「 步兵王青被綁走」一句話，大約已經為元兵所殺。但即使活著回來，也和夏仲一樣，因為地位卑微，所以人們也不會注意他了。</p>
<p>鄒挺為二僕夫，「指南錄」「至揚州」第十六首序中有云：山下一里，有古廟。廟中有乞丐佔據居住。廟前有井，於是留下 品武，鄒捷下山汲水，想或許可以得到米菜，稍微救濟飢餓。不料巡邏兵至，二人首先被抓獲。二人被搜出腰間白銀近三百兩，全部給了巡邏兵。巡邏兵拿到錢，才沒有殺他們。等到巡邏兵過去，二人方才回來，相對哀泣，又慶幸性命得以保全。</p>
<p>「高沙道中」序中有「僕夫鄒捷躺倒 在 地下，馬過去，踏了他的腳，流血」等語，此外亦無記載。</p>
<p>其餘四人，都在途中逃避。當時天祥在眞揚之間徘徊，想走通州，又怕被抓，想入楊州，又怕被殺。正在行止未決之際，四人忽然各自帶著所懷的一百五十星逃走了。這四人就是余元慶，李茂，吳亮與蕭 　。事蹟見於「指南錄」「至揚州」第九第十兩首序中。四人中唯有余元慶略有事蹟可考，其餘幾人連身份也考查不出來了。</p>
<p>元慶在天祥初逃時，頗有功勞，實在也是一個不可多得的人。「指南錄」「定計難」序中有云：</p>
<p>我在京城外，日夜謀劃逃脫，卻找不到機會……至平江，想逃又沒有成功。至鎮江，謀劃更加迫切，商議前往眞州，杜架閣與幔前將官余元慶一起參與謀劃。元慶，是眞州人……</p>
<p>後來逃走時，找到船隻渡江，元慶功勞最大。「得船難」序云：</p>
<p>北方的船隻佈滿江面，百姓沒有一艘船可以詢問。杜架閣與人一起商議，都因為沒有船而長歎停止。之後，余元慶遇見他的故舊，為北方管理船隻，於是秘密詢問他，答應給他承宜使，銀千兩。那人說：我為宋朝救得一丞相，回去建立大功業，要錢有什麼用？只求批示文書作為他日趨炎附勢的憑證……</p>
<p>這位管船人也不平凡，天祥最終依靠他才得以渡江。但將要渡江的時候，不知何故，幾乎導致失敗，仍然依靠元慶不辭辛勞，最終得以如願。「候船難」序云：我先留下二校坐在船中，秘密約定在甘露寺下等我。等到我到了，船不知在何處，心中非常窘迫。大家都說船已經失約怎麼辦！我攜帶匕首，不忍心自殺，實在不得已，唯有投水了！</p>
<p>余元慶 脫下 衣服涉水，尋找一二里路，才找到船。船到，大家稽首為死裡逃生表示祝賀。</p>
<p>照此看來，元慶卻並不是一個吃不得苦的人，後來逃避，最大的原因，在於天祥處於進退兩難之境，而又一時不決，他本是眞州人，家鄉在邇，所以一時失志，就回家去了。而且臨行之先，還曾為天祥盡力。「至揚州」第七首序云：</p>
<p>我正未知進退，余元慶領來一個賣柴人至，說：相公有福！相公有福！問：能引導我至高沙嗎？說：能。問：何處可以暫避一日？說在農家可以。問：此去幾里？說二三十里。問：有巡邏兵嗎？說：數日不一至。日：今日巡邏兵至如何？說：看福氣如何了！</p>
<p>元慶之所以能領到賣柴人，大約就因為是在家鄉的緣故。然而後來大家始終不決，又不敢跟賣柴人去暫避，余元慶感到前途渺茫，當前又危險萬分，所以竟不辭而行。其餘三人，或許本與元慶同夥，或許 州也是他們的家鄉，所以就一起行動，都不辭而行了。</p>
<p>有人說：余元慶等既然不願生死於前，為何又畏懼於後？但這等說法，只能用以 責備有知識的士大夫。元慶是一個武人，能夠如此，已經很不容易。換句話說，如果沒有他，天祥連長江也渡不過，何能逃脫？所以中途逃避，實在也由於天祥當時處境，實在不易使人相信其必有希望的緣故。武人智短加之他或許曾和同人起過齟齬，所以不能善始善終，竟以一走了事了。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血 162</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「怎麼試呢？」小老虎問。</p>
<p>「那容易，」鶴見笑着，「耀小姐，岳大哥，都請坐遠些，」說著對耀羣和我點了點頭，又對小老虎說，「你就把我當作敵人，奪我手把手槍；」一邊說，一邊掏出了手槍，滴答一聲響，把子彈 退下了，放在口袋裏；這個動作，十分利索敏捷， 大概 只有一 眨眼時間。</p>
<p>小老虎不會客氣，立刻測量了一下位置，自己退到這塊空地的角上，又叫鶴見站在對角；兩人距離大約三四碼遠近；</p>
<p>「您一舉槍，我就動手！」小老虎眼睛裏，又發出閃爍的奇光。</p>
<p>「行！」鶴見邊說邊把手槍一舉，姿勢迅速無比。誰知他剛抬手舉到位置的那一瞬，小老虎早一伏身，一個搶臂觔斗過去，一點聲息也沒有，迅疾的程度，無法形容。只見他，人一伏身，已經擦地過去，到了鶴見腳前。</p>
<p>鶴見柔道頗高，在軍隊裏學過奪槍這個手法，並且也有不少實際地區經驗；也算得上靈活，動作也輕捷無比。雖然他很快，小老虎比他更快，就在鶴見移動身形的時候，避開了槍口，就地一個反旋子，人已到了鶴見背後；說也不信，就在一晃眼之間，小老虎的左手已經插在鶴見左邊脅下，托住了他的手肘，右手順着鶴見的右臂，把鶴見的手槍，連搶帶手握住，提起向懷裏輕輕一帶，鶴見的右臂，一時拗住了筋，不能用力，眉尖一皺，似乎感到一陣疲痛似的，只好放手；那枝手槍，早到了小老虎手裏了。這是一種擒拿的變化手法，如若對方執拗，不肯放下手中器械，手臂就有折斷的可能。</p>
<p>「佩服，佩服。」鶴見頭額上已見了汗珠了。</p>
<p>「不！」小老虎 張開嘴笑着，「這是好玩兒呢，要是幹真的，您只要一挪步，我早給您一腿撩的爬下去呢。」</p>
<p>「怎麼說？」鶴見正式叨教了。</p>
<p>「這樣」小老虎把鶴見送到原站的位置上，「我 跳到這裏，您躍起向這邊一讓，這樣，」小老虎把一雙左腿插到 鶴見的 腿裏，輕輕向右一踢一撩。就這 比劃著演習，鶴見的左腿已經懸起，身體覺得一晃蕩，也向右邊倒了兩步，幸虧小老虎牽住了他的左臂，才站穩了 身子。</p>
<p>「嗐」！鶴見一而拭着汗珠，一面驚歎着，「我這柔道竟是白練了的呢！誰想中國拳技，竟是這樣變化無窮。」</p>
<p>「您還沒想到虎弟手上的功夫哩。」耀羣坐在靠窗的椅子上笑着說，「我想要是遇見真的敵人，怕他不見得這們文明呢。」</p>
<p>「確然，確然！」鶴見很誠懇地承認了，「我應該拜師了。」說着，也退到一張椅子上坐下了。又對小老虎笑着，「小老師，您請坐。」鶴見拍着自已身邊的一張椅子。</p>
<p>「您二位剛從醫院來？」我插口換了一個題目，「吳先生快能起坐了，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「我同虎弟是兩點多鐘去的，吳先生已經下床了，精神似乎還好，可就是憂愁得厲害。一瞧見我們，盡淌眼淚；真叫人看着難受。我安慰了他幾句，勸他想開此。可是我又不知道應該說些什麼。本來麼，好好一家六七口，活鮮鮮的人；太太，大小姐，二小姐，三小姐小丁香，還有兩個活活潑潑的男孩子，就這們不明不白地，給那羣土匪鬼子們，殺得一個不留，還能叫他不傷心嗎？」</p>
<p>「前兩天，醫院的大夫，說他盡想自殺……」自由談</p>
<h3>和平之城：紐約「唐人街」</h3>
<p>— 武雄譯自「紐約時報週刊」</p>
<p>讀本月四日申報駐美特派員手樹濟先生報導舊金山唐人街， 謹譯紐約時報週刊一文，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>假如你這幾天到紐約「中國城」（即唐人街）去走走，你決不會懷疑到，現在中國在進行着內戰，沒有胡再比這五條彎曲的街道，更讓緊張的神經得以安靜的了。六千個中國人和平而隱居似地在那裏住着。在這些餐館，理髮店，古玩鋪和老舊的住房中，沒有國共衝突的糾紛，國內政局在這裏的反響，有如揚子江上七月的微風。</p>
<p>一個特點勤勞</p>
<p>中國城有五家中國文的報紙，一家是共產黨的。老年人也看看要聞版，可是他們更大的興趣，是裏頁的本市新聞。在副刋上有：誰家理發館的老板娶了親，誰家衣館主人寫了一首詩；和從小型報上翻譯的紐約犯罪的新聞。他們很少有政治的熱情，他們有一個特點—勤勞；一個愛好—「錢」；—一個信念「忠於家族」。</p>
<p>中國城對於那些勇敢地去觀光的人，仍然給一些假的印象。一羣一羣的中國人彼此小聲談話，靠著住屋的牆，或者俯在半明不暗的茶館裏的桌子上，好像是在「計劃革命」，事實上，他們卻在聊天。</p>
<p>安居樂業</p>
<p>雖然去觀光的人，有很多幻想可是事實上中國城是紐約最和平的區域，第五警察區的犯罪名單中，盡是些西洋人。中國城以外幾條街的地方，就是許多乞討的人，和在暗淡的陰影中對罵，而且甚至於互相動起武來。</p>
<p>相反地，在中國城內，所有乞丐和醉漢都是些不長進的西洋人，他們到這裏來向遊客要錢，並且在幾家酒吧間裏飲酒。在過去八年中，中國城中只有一個人因醉酒而被捕的，殺人或犯其他較重罪刑的，沒有一位。至於雅片，又貴，質料又壞，現在已經沒有人問津了。</p>
<p>很少紐約人知道中國城究竟有多大。對於大紐約城其他區域的人，總以為中國城是遊客值得參觀，可以用筷子吃飯的一個大地方。事實上約六千的居民只住在小小的五條街內。</p>
<p>中國城也是大紐約四萬八千東方人的精神家園。這些東方人一到傍晚或星期日就都齊聚在中國城，來談天，來理發，來看親友，當幾個大家族宴會之日，旗子在街前飛舞着，姓楊的，姓李的；從費城，從波士頓，或者從西岸趕來參加盛會。</p>
<p>男人世界</p>
<p>中國城的第一個中國人是在一八六七年從大埠來的，他在皮爾路十三號開了一個古玩會舖，以後，從加拿大，古巴，墨西哥和中國來了許多中國人，有一件奇異的事實，就是：這裏的居民雖然大多由家庭關係組成，但男女之比為八比一。大多數的已婚男子把他們的妻子丟在中國。而且明顯地，並不想什麽補救方法。中國城是一個奇怪的男人的世界。</p>
<p>中國城有很多教堂，有時一條街上就有三家，但參加的人並不多。星期日，天主教堂很熱鬧，但盡是鄰近的意大利人，去年冬天，天主 敎新從中國來到中國城講道，參加的不過五十人而已。</p>
<p>有一個家老的意大利理髮館，作中國人的生意已四十餘年。不久以前，一位中國報館的編輯，一方面在中國大學讀書的，理髮的時候和理髮師攀談起來。那理髮師說：「我在中國城四十年，你是第一個回答我的中國人。」</p>
<p>東方精神 清淡幽閒</p>
<p>中國城的中國人，好像仍保持享受他們消閒的東方藝術。他們不狂熱去追求 快樂。他們 窮盡地談談家庭的事情，商業問題和中國女人。少數女人在中國城 當然很受重視，但也不過只是談談而已。無論中西的女人從中國城走過，決不會被人吹口笛，或被人調笑的。</p>
<p>中國城人們的祖先，是有雄心的，是中國冒險家，商人和水手。他們離開家園，到國外去作拓荒者，現在中國城的中國人卻過着與人無爭而不動感情的生活，而且對中國社會的習慣循規蹈矩。</p>
<p>父母仍根據舊習慣管教子女，他們常常告訴兒女們：「在美國出生的孩子是沒腦筋的 年輕人說話太多了」。在戰時，中國青年很多參加軍隊，但平時，他們很少遠行的，他們酷愛讀書，可是很少入大學。</p>
<p>中國城的唯一法庭是密街十六號頂樓的中華女子協會。中國人從來不到紐約市的法庭去。</p>
<p>中國城不完全是中國化，也不完全是美國化。在這幾條街之內，一種文化正在衰落，而另一種文化又還沒有建立起來。老年人還用舊法子來生活的，並且讓他們的妻子在樓上不見人。他們只讀中國報和中國刋物，可是他們的兒子們卻也不會說中國話，不會讀中文， 寧願讀紐約的小型英文報。</p>
<p>他們是驕傲的 他们是誠實的</p>
<p>在老年人中，沒有東方的哲人，在青年人中，也沒有政治領導者而且也只有少數真正的學生。所以有些人在一個傳統的氣氛中生活，卻缺乏了新的創造的力量，但是他們是驕傲的，他們是誠實的，而且當他們晚上站着談話的時候，他們常常有一種冷淡的表情，好像他帶有三千年古文化的倦意似的。</p>
<h3>Fire at (Little Qin Prince)</h3>
<p>— Ling Keming</p>
<p>Hearing of a great fire somewhere,</p>
<p>Letting it spread into a field of ash;</p>
<p>Now I believe the ancient saying is wonderful: "To create magic water, one needs an umbrella handle!"</p>
<h3>The Lantern Festival is Over, No More Merrymaking</h3>
<p>— Fang Wen</p>
<p>This year's Lantern Festival coincided with the return of spring to the earth, auspicious snow just after, golden rice and white rice, soaring success, prices rising for all goods, thriving prosperity, speculative hoarding, universal joy, spending this fine evening, naturally particularly lively. The international metropolis of Shanghai was exactly a scene of trees of fire and silver flowers, the city open all night, gongs and drums sounded together, lanterns and beacons the same color, singing and dancing of peaceful prosperity, oh, how glorious!</p>
<p>On the streets of Shanghai that night, high stilt performances, the Land Boat Dance, and others, in team after team, came in an endless stream. Also, there were various lanterns, colorful, incredibly ingenious. Among the most wonderful were the Two Dragons Gate Formation, the Eight-Legged Crab crawling sideways on the road, the Water Dragon Playing with Phoenix, the Airplane doing Somersaults, the Water Rat Stealing Oil to Eat, all kinds of forms, without exception, had innovative designs, making people happy to stop and watch. Especially the Allied friendly forces, also watched with great fascination.</p>
<p>Celebrating the Lantern Festival, it is said that it should be lively, the livelier the better, but once the Lantern Festival is over, everyone should get down to business, release their conscience to do what should be done, and absolutely must not continue the merrymaking!</p>
<p>Weekend</p>
<h3>American Movies in Full Swing, Recruiting Movie Star Doubles in Shanghai, Part of "Stealing the Treasury" Filmed on Location in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Several days ago, various English newspapers in this city carried a strange advertisement, without the name of the person or company placing it, nor stating the purpose or intention, only saying that it was recruiting several foreign beauties, but listing the conditions such as each person's figure measurements, weight in pounds, etc., in extremely detailed terms. Readers mostly did not understand what the real meaning was. Upon inquiry, it turned out that the American Columbia Pictures Corporation had come to Shanghai to shoot on location.</p>
<p>Columbia is one of Hollywood's eight major production companies. This time, it is filming "Stealing the Treasury," a film about a major international drug trafficking case. It is said that part of the background is Shanghai, so the film's director, Nachailuo, reversed the past Hollywood practice of "closing the door to build a car," and earnestly rushed to Shanghai to film on location. However, because the journey was long, it was inconvenient for the delicate actress to cross the ocean, so they placed an advertisement to recruit a double.</p>
<p>Not only is the leading actress preparing to find a double in Shanghai, but even the cinematographer has also hired someone here, Wang Xiaoting. Wang is the MGM company's newsreel photographer stationed in China. I remember when the enemy bombed Shanghai in those years, Wang Xiaoting shot a newsreel at the North Railway Station. The scene was that the station had just been bombed, full of broken walls and debris, and a one-year-old child was sitting on the tracks, his clothes tattered, his whole body burned, crying loudly, surrounded by deathly silence.</p>
<p>Just this one photograph won the sympathy and support of the people of various countries, and the inhuman act of the Japanese invaders killing innocent people and indiscriminately bombing left a deep impression internationally.</p>
<p>Until recently, one magazine praised it as one of the best news photographs of the last ten years. In the new film "Flying Tigers," there is a close-up shot after a major bombing, the background and the child's situation are all similar to the above, naturally influenced by that news photograph.</p>
<h3>Marriage Advertisement - Just Promotion</h3>
<p>— Fan Shiren</p>
<p>Recently, someone placed a marriage advertisement for "Peking Opera Asia Queen" Cao Xiuqin, and sure enough, many people who usually admired her wrote letters to apply. In fact, this marriage advertisement was just a joke between her and the writer, and was used to do some "promotion."</p>
<p>Sisters Kunyi Li Qianghua and Li Weihua, who came from the rear, sang at the Great Stage for a period of time, and then had no opportunity to join a troupe, but their presence could often be seen in social venues, so some people called them "Socialite Peking Opera Actresses."</p>
<p>One night, at the Tianchan Stage, I watched Cheng Yanqiu perform Mei Fei. During the Golden Palace scene, the set was full of light bulbs, appearing to be performing "The Civet Cat for Crown Prince," this kind of "gimmick" is both clichéd and low-grade, and does not fit the Peking Opera style, and the style is not very harmonious with the Peking Opera atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Herb</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>Heard about the Legend of Lingzhi</p>
<p>Lingzhi's educational aid exhibition caused a sensation, and many people came from afar to visit, eager to make a small examination, to provide a means of conversation.</p>
<p>Lunheng says, "Lingzhi grows in the soil, when the soil's Qi is harmonious, so Lingzhi grows in the soil, eating it makes people live long, there is Azure Cloud Lingzhi, Dragon Immortal Lingzhi, Golden Noisy Lingzhi, Nine-Bend Lingzhi, Fire Lingzhi, Moon Essence Lingzhi, Noctilucent Lingzhi, Ignited Fire Lingzhi, White Cloud Lingzhi, Mica Lingzhi, Phoenix Brain Lingzhi, Five Virtues Lingzhi, Ten Thousand Years Lingzhi."</p>
<p>The Materia Medica Five Lingzhi Classic says: "Azure Lingzhi grows on Mount Tai, Red Lingzhi grows on Mount Huo, Yellow Lingzhi grows on Mount Song, White Lingzhi grows on Mount Hua, Black Lingzhi grows on Mount Chang, Purple Lingzhi grows in the valleys of Mount Gaoxia, the six Lingzhi are all harvested on the eighth day of June."</p>
<p>The Langhuan Records says: "Lingzhi is also called Longevity Grass, also called Xiyi." Shuowen says: "Lingzhi is a divine herb."</p>
<p>Baopuzi says: "There are hundreds of kinds of Lingzhi." Other books such as the Lanyang Miscellany and the Lingzhi Collection, etc., all have records of it, but each has its own say, which will be omitted.</p>
<p>In the spring of the seventeenth year of Emperor Ming of Han, Lingzhi grew in the front hall. In the third month of the seventh year of Tang Tianbao, a jade Lingzhi grew on the pillars of the Datong Hall, with a divine light illuminating the hall. The army begged to add the emperor's title, Kaiyuan Tianbao Sacred and Martial Responding to the Way. In the seventh month of the second year of Suzong Shangyuan, jade Lingzhi, one stem with three flowers, grew on the beam of the throne in the Yanying Hall. The Five Elements Records of the Song Dynasty states: "In the ninth month of the fifth year of Taiping Xingguo, Lingzhi like lotus flowers grew on the hall beams of the ZhenDing Prefecture temporary palace. In the first month of the fourth year of Xianping, Weizhou presented a Lingzhi grass, shaped like a Buddha. On Xinwei day of the fifth month of the first year of Dayou Xiangfu, five Lingzhi plants were found in the Konglin, with colors of yellow and purple like clouds, and in the shape of people wearing crowns and hats." There are countless cases like these.</p>
<p>The Record of Extensive Information says: "Famous mountains produce divine Lingzhi, the grass of immortality, the upper Lingzhi is for carriages and horses, the middle Lingzhi is in the shape of humans, the lower Lingzhi is for the six domestic animals."</p>
<p>Regarding Lingzhi literature, there is Tang Cui Rong's Crown Prince's Ode to Lingzhi Grass, Song Qin Guan's Preface to Yu Zizhi, Song Wang Anshi's Lingzhi Pavilion Record, Huang Tingjian's Auspicious Lingzhi Pavilion Record, and Ji Zhou Fengyuan Wang Xiu Pavilion Record, etc.</p>
<p>Song Su Shi's letter to Ju Shizheng says: "Although Wendeng is somewhat remote, all things can be established. An herb called White Stone Lingzhi grows in the island, its fragrance is like chewing tea at first, and is very good after a long time, it is said to be very beneficial to people, the Duke must be informed. The White Stone Lingzhi is shaped like a rock tripe, but has a fragrance, this is how to distinguish it, keep it secret, keep it secret."</p>
<p>According to the Jushan Miscellaneous Records: "Jinshan in Wu County especially has much Lingzhi, often produced on the ground, mostly blue in color, the mountain people pick it up every time, and do not value it."</p>
<p>In summary, Lingzhi, although an auspicious herb, has been produced over the years, and is only produced in deep mountains, rarely being discovered by people. As for the legend of "taking it to become an immortal," it is all mythology, not to be believed. As for whether it can be used as a medicine, it remains to be studied by medical scientists.</p>
