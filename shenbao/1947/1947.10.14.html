<h3>徐思平談役政對人民以誠相見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕軍聞社訊：目前整個役政，在局外人頗不能了解者，即爲何在抗戰勝利之後仍繼讀征兵，兵役局長徐思平特爲此對記者談：「征兵爲建國。建軍，自衛之方式，並非因目前剿匪戡亂而須征兵，在世界上任何一個國家，平時必須有備，以固國防，茍若不征，一旦有發，則無以爲備，故目前征兵純係為此大前提而出發者，而目前剿匪實為使國家走上統一之必經途徑，人民有服兵役之義務，為憲法所明文規定，而兵役法則係根據憲法所擬訂，經最高當局核定者，決毋偏毋倚，斷不會不公平，且對應征服役者多方優待，對於役政推行，更隨時注意，加以改進。關於志願兵之征集，因大城市施行征兵制度似有困難，故變通辦理，如有不足額時，仍將抽　，雖目前施行役政尚有若干困難，但盼新聞界多予協助，役政常局對人民絕對以誠相見，一切困難必可解決」。</p>

<h3>王寵惠談蒲立特建議　符合杜魯門政策　貸款成功幣値即可穩定</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕記者十三日往訪外交權威王　惠博士，叩詢對蒲立　建議意見。據稱，蒲氏歷使各國，對國際情勢之瞭解，自極深刻，觀其援華建議一文，切實中肯，不惟中國表示歡迎，凡欲見世界和平實現者，亦無仔不深感欣　。　蒲氏此文，其出發　實與杜魯門總統之援歐政策相符。蒲氏此文旨在喚起美國朝野對亞洲局勢之注意，並敦促其政府採取合理有效之遠東政策，藉免　枯之弊。王氏認共產國際之復活，主要係宣傳攻勢，但此事必將促使民主與極權之對立，益形尖說，至於在日益險　之國際形勢下，中國之能度應如何？王氏謂，我們不必以國家爲對象。我們旣以民主爲一貫主張、今後自將站在民主陣綫方面，為世界和平之實現積極努力。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕蒲立特緊爭援　　議發表後，中美　論，均極重視。記者昨分訪本市敎育界人士，復且大學校長章益，交通大學　　程孝剛，光華大學校長朱經農，　南大學校長李　雍諸氏詢以對此事意見。章益校長談稱，蒲氏對中國看法，極其正確遠大，如美國對我貸款成功，則物價可平，幣値可定，國內秩序可恢復正常狀態。章氏指稱，自雅爾達密約以後至馬歇爾來華此一段時間內，無人再比蒲氏公平而能透識中國者。程孝剛校長談稱，國人麼自求努力上進，自力更生，而後，除美國外，其他各國亦願援華。渠認爲美國　　。無論其貸款成功與否，其着眼點均爲美國本身。朱經農校長談稱：美國貨款，對中國建設極　　　。我國大學敎育，設備及師資，均感欠缺，如美國貸款成功，我可向國外訂購大批儀器，　　國際第一流敎授來華執敎，希望友邦協助吾人建設，而不接受外人對我國之干涉。蒲氏　　，可改變一部份美國人對我之觀感。李壽雍校長談種，中國問題，直接間接，均足以影響世界之安危，吾人不僅希望美國貸我十三億五千萬元，且希望將有更大之援助。（下接第二版第一欄）</p>

<h3>物價狂潮中的刺激因素</h3>
<p>開始踏入十月以來，物價不斷狂漲，到了最近，漲風愈來愈狂，甚至，早晚市價不同。人民在這物價的狂潮中，眞有喘息不過來之勢。中樞關心滬市物價，近派全國經濟委員會委員劉振東黃元彬施奎齡等一行來滬調查。可是，歡迎劉氏等一行到滬的，不是習見的物價漲風稍戢，而反是物價的繼續狂漲。劉氏等來滬以後，瞬已歡日，我們未嘗在報紙上看見他們發表談話，想是致力於調查研究之故，不尚空言；這種精神，頗覺値得贊佩。老實說，過去物價之漲，有時常常爲一般要人隨便發言，隨便劃策所刺激起來的；故劉氏的等緘默，至少不是刺激物價的因素。</p>
<p>這幾天來，物價的在漲，乃是每個上海市民所親身體騐到的事實。這種狂潮演變的結果，不特入民生計以及一般的工商業戚到嚴重的威脅，抑且足以影饗社會秩序。無論從那一方面着想，政府必須竭力設法制止這種狂漲。如果沒有方法而聽其自然，或雖有方法而舉棋不定，那政府便是無能。</p>
<p>物價的狂漲，在這幾天內突破了過去的紀錄。卽以食米一項而論，在本月初，本市米價還在每石五十七萬左右，其後逐步上漲三五萬元不等，到了昨天，另售門市米價竟有漲出八十萬元大關的趨勢：綜計在十日以內，漲價百分之五十左右！在同時期內，一般物價均見高漲，其中食油紗布市價的狂漲，尤令人歎爲觀止。就在這十天以內，對於物價的狂漲，我們也不難窺見它的一些來踪去跡。此次十月的漲風，我們追溯上去，不得不從九月三十日起自美滙市價的提高。平準外滙基金委員會從那天起，將美滙的市價握高三千五百元，從四萬六千元增加到四萬九千五百元。接着在當天我們就看見食油市價狂漲，飛升十萬：同時麵粉議價又提高十八萬，並決議此後對於麵粉講價，將取機動方式；然而當時的米價還在五十七萬元左右。到了十月四日，棉布奇峯突起，紗價又加調整，二十支紗每件增加七十萬元。次日紗布依舊狂漲，粗細一致上升，自八十餘萬至壹白餘萬不等，而米價還依舊徘徊未動。到了六日，米價終因紗布食油及其它物價的上騰而漲了三萬，共時適遠期外滙又提高百分之八，紗布市塲益趨混亂。據報載公布消息，自上月廿九日至六月四日間，批發物價指數已自六七·五六八上升至七四·三六七。到了九日，美滙市價又經平準基金委員會提高至五五·三〇〇元，而米價乃躍升十萬，自五十七萬左右增加到六十七萬元左右。到了最近，物價益趨瘋狂，米價幾超出了八十萬的大關。在這樣的狂潮下，人民的生計日蹙；除了投機圖利的少數人以外，大多數正當的工商業也岌岌可危！</p>
<p>我們從過去十日間物價的波動，不難看見外匯市價與物價變動的關係。外匯市價漲了，物價跟着漲；而物價漲了，也影響到外匯市價的上漲。這已經是一種惡性循環：更何况裏面還夾着黑市外匯與心理因素在內。倘使黑市外匯的漲風能够遏止，那末物價漲風也許可以稍跌。的確，有過去十天內，曾有一個短時期物價回跌的趨勢。因爲一般人多以爲黑市外匯的上漲僅是一種瘋狂，他們想回復平靜，他們集中注意力於市價外匯的是否上升。在本月八日，當外匯及金鈔黑市已經瘋狂波動的時候，平準外匯基金委員會的某負責人，曾對新聞記者談稱：「外匯市價之調整，決不跟隨黑市」。乃此言甫出，次日我們就看見平衡會將美匯市價又提高五千八百元，改爲五萬五千三百元。第二日適値雙十國慶，雖無公開市價，而人心已戚不安。這樣演變的結果，終於演成今日的狂潮。</p>
<p>物價外　固已互爲因果，形成一種惡性循環，　觀乎本月間此次物價狂漲的經過，我們不能不說受了外匯市價變動劇烈之害。平衡會在旬日以內有兩次外匯市價的變動，此在一般人民的心理上，不能不說有相當重大的打擊。特別是該會的負責人說市價外匯決不迫隨黑市，言猶在耳，而外匯市價却已起了波動。無論平衡會自有其充分的理由，硬說外匯市價的變動不是追隨黑市，但在事實上，一般入民總不免要當它作爲追隨黑市！如果長此以追隨黑市爲消滅黑市的方法，那外匯市價無異跑狗場追逐電兎的狗了！這樣管理外匯，誰也會管；但刺激物價的後果又誰負其責？</p>
<p>近年來一般人民已深爲物價的變動而苦惱，　們都願意物價有一天穩定。在這個時候，政府當局的措施，尤應把握人心，切不可專在理論方面發空論，唱高調，而在實際行動方面，却往往使一般人民感到失望。最要緊的，職掌管理的人，決大計，定大策，必須絲毫不涉個人利害的打算，尤須極端機密而不可事前走漏一些風聲。否則捕風捉影之徒，往往因利乘便，有所企圖，而更刺激物價的上漲。少數人發了財，廣大羣衆却害苦了命！</p>

<h3>蒲立特建議反響</h3>
<p>（上接一版）自蒲立特緊急援華建議發表後，本市外籍人士反　，隨其本身之立塲觀點而互異，大致可歸納爲兩種，茲分話如下：　認爲蒲氏爲美國政界名人，其援華之建議，必然引起白宮及國務院之重視。至於蒲立德建議之援華方式是否可行，則爲另一問題，其佔計所需美元之數額，竟精確至斯，尤堪訝異。　認爲浦氏建黨中之兩點，實現均有困難。以借款而言，援歐之馬歇兩計劃已受阻撓，復興朝鮮南部所需之款項亦因國會之反對而减少，故至少在目前，中國獲得借款之希望不大。以派遣麥帥來華担任顧問而論，麥帥誠爲一將才，未必適宜於任此類政治工作。以蒲氏本人而論，在外交界中友人頗多，惟在美聲望並不甚高，去年活動費城市長，亦告落選，可爲明證。故其建議之實際影饗，尚難預測。</p>

<p>合作事業現在成爲波蘭經濟體系中相當主耍的一環。共產黨的社會經濟政策，將所有的企業分成三種：國營，合作，私營。依照一九四六年一月三日頒佈的「企業國家化」法案，私人經營的工廠，限制不得超過五十個工人。換句話說：凡是五十個工人以上的工廠，統統交由國家接收，或合作社辦理。全波蘭的合作社數目，還沒有詳細統計，估計合作社社員的人數，大約在三百萬人以上。我沒有時間去「路茲」城，路茲是波蘭的工業中心，就最近的人口統計，路茲有將近一百萬的人口，較華沙首都尤大。（華沙在戰前，一度有過二百萬人，現在僅餘三十萬。）在路茲，比較像樣的工廠，都由國家從私人手中接收了過來，有許多已經由政府付給了廠主以補償，有若干工廠，要到明年後年的國家總預算裏，纔能列人補償的款項。波蘭的朋友告訴我；企業國營問題，現在常常成為國會辯論的題材。在野的米古安契的波蘭農氏黨，他們堅決主張小企業保留自由競爭的制度。國際宣傳處原先要派一輛專車，送我到佛洛茲瓦夫，去參劃最大的國營紡織工廠的，臨時我因爲有事，取消了原約。第二天，他們派人陪我參觀了草沙對河的維特耳巧克立糖廠，那是波蘭解放以後，政府從私人手要接收過來的工廠之一。</p>
<p>我對波闌共產黨，在工業方面建設的精神，異常欽佩。就拿維特耳糖廠說罷：一千二百個職工，都能够勤奮愉快地工作，特別是工人的</p>
<p>福利設施</p>
<p>託兒所，職工醫院，娛樂塲，雖然沒有像美國福特工廠那樣富麗堂皇的設施，但也整潔乾凈，處處看得出：常事人曾經費過心血，認認眞眞的當一件事在做。</p>
<p>維特耳工廠的廠長舒路茵斯基，一個和藹誠樸的中年人，很久以前，他在維爾納大學的化學工程系畢業，製糖原不是他的本行，但因爲學過化學工程，許多「門檻」，一經硏究，不難了然。他給我看了很多照片，那是華沙剛解放時候糖廠被破壞的情形「雖然說是政府接收了私人的企業，但是，這局面幾乎全是從新開創起來的！」</p>
<p>他說：全廠的工人，都隸屬於波闌工食，工人採取「工時制」，每星期平均工作四十六小時，每小時的工資是三十七至六十個波幣不等，看工作熟練與否而決定。工人以每月收入之百分之一，捐繳工會會費。職員的薪給，按月計酬，數自自一萬五千波幣到九萬不等，職員和工人，都能够享受託兒所，醫院等等福和設施。此外，還有工廠內部的「社會保險」制度，以保障工人的意外與不幸事件。</p>
<p>他說：去年一年的生產量是二千零四十七噸，包括巧克立，餅乾，和糖類。一千二百名工人之中，男的七百五十，女的四百五十。最妙的是：工廠</p>
<p>收歸國營</p>
<p>以後，原來的老　兼總經理，現在仍然在廠裏當工人。舒路茵斯基說：「原來的老蘭，是波闌的資本家，他雖然沒受過高等敎育，但是對於製糖一項，他是內行，他有經騐，所以政府接管以後，仍舊當要他在廠裏工作。</p>
<p>現在，維特耳工廠，直接隸屬於波蘭糧食部，因爲甜品是西洋人必備的食料之一。一切工廠的生產，都由糧食部指揮　度，工人工資的多寡，由糧食部和工會會商決定。我間那位廠長：在維特耳廠裏，有沒有發生過罷工事件？他搖搖頭。上上下下，我在廠裏兜了半天，看了許多「門外漢」無法了解的機器，我知道那些機器，一半是英國造的，一半是德國造的。巧克立的主要原料「可可」，是由非洲的「黃金海岸」運來的，包糖的紙張，是由製紙業公會按期供給的。</p>
<p>公會和工會制度，使整個工業發生聯繫，這在資本主義國家和共產主義國家沒有分別。波蘭在一九四五年十月，成立了「中央設計局」，今年年初，公佈了一個「三年經濟建設方案」，此項方案的內容，著重在工業和交通運輸的配合，尤其著重在工業和工業之間的聯繫。比這個範圍更大的，是</p>
<p>鐵幕背後</p>
<p>國與國之間的工業聯　，正在逐步地加强。我在維特耳糖廠裏，看見他們正在準備送往捷克和瑞典展變的珍品。臨告辭的時候，廠長舒路茵斯基還告訴了我一個故事。他說：美國共和黨的總統競選人史丹遜，訪問華沙的時候，也由外交部陪同來參觀維特耳糖廠，美國前任駐波大使勃累斯萊也在座，史丹遜爲了要看看工人們的實際生活，特地在大餐廳和工人共　。「當然囉，我們窮國的工人，吃的祇是粗食淡飯，那位史丹遜先生却吃得津津有味。苦了的，却是那位勃累斯萊大使，如坐針氈，食不下咽。史丹遜光生好幾回國默地對大使說：吃　，那麼可口的午餐！」</p>
<p>波蘭人到現在，還是記恨著那位前任美國大使，若干波闌知識份子，說他是最不懂國際友誼的外交官，也有人駡他是彼關的最大敵人。有位波蘭左派　紙的記者告訴我：「勃果斯萊最近又在美國　誌上寫文章，大駡波蘭」！我看他說話的時候十分氣憤。我說：可惜我沒看見那本雜誌，我倒很希望看看他到底個怎棵駡法。（續昨日第三版完）</p>

<h3>歐洲各國要求援助數額　美堅持應予削減　主張重開十六國會議修改報吿書　援歐計劃進入政治階段</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十三日電〕權威方面息：美政府開始與歐洲十六國經濟合作委員會主席弗朗克斯及共他委員晤議時，將調查重開十六國會議之可能性，俾在將美政府之援助計劃向國會提出以前，得由歐洲國家同意巴黎會議原來報告寗內不能避他的修改。此間歐洲外交界人士對於此一建議，並不感覺熱烈興趣，但美國權成方面則謂：歐洲國家若不願再度召集會議，則美政府僅能：　以巴黎會議之原來報告附同美政府之批評及建議案，一倂向國會提出；或　僅與弗朗克斯率領之代表團議定修改辦法，而不交由十六國一體表決，此舉勢必引起十六國內個別國家之批評。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日合衆電〕馬歇爾計劃將於十三日在此間進抵政治階段，依據目前跡象，美國官員認爲十六國家巴黎會議之報告，須大事修改。美官方人員與歐洲技術專家上週會談後，美官員認為該計劃其有過於强調若干部門之　據。彼等認為依據生產能力之技術，計算此關於歐洲四年需要之報告，有欠現實，且對美國之估計過高。甫自歐洲回國之國會議員數人，認爲母　竇行馬歇爾計劃。其中若干議員，可能於本週內與政治問題專家舉行會議，討論修正數字及改變時間事宜。美官員定於十三日再度與歐洲專家會談，參加者將有歐洲經濟合作委員會主席弗朗克斯，代理國務鄉洛維特，及美國其他高級外交官員。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕巴黎十六國曾議財政委員會之支付協定委員會於九月二十二日起在倫敦開會，硏究財政委員會所擬之歐洲貨幣自動兌換制度。其報告書已於今日公布，該一制度之目的在促進歐洲各國間貿易之發展，俾得較在現行之而國貨幣兌換制度下，交換更多數量之物資。在自動兌換制度之下，一國在另一國握有因貿易所產生之存款者，得用以解決對第三國之貿易債務。此項劃賑制度，可以使以黃金或可以兌換貨幣之支付，减至最低程度。</p>
<h3>西歐亟應自助不能專待美元　美國會訪歐特委會發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十二日電〕美衆院前組維特別委會，赴歐調查各國對美援助之需要問題，在歐洲十八週國家，曾作經六星期之調查，今由該委會副主席漢德發表聲明，略謂：吾人之任務，本已不易，今則因歐洲兩種普遍錯誤之觀念，而更形困難：第一，以爲美國爲防止經濟崩潰起見，非繼續大量輸出不可；第二，以爲馬歇爾之建議，事實上使美國方面構或一種責任。抑有進者，人民方面，非比負責之政府官員，似不大明瞭美國可資輸出之糧食與燃料，爲數有限。此等錯誤觀念造成一種並無根據之樂觀主義，有時甚至對於當前之眞正困難，尚聊以自慰。吾人歸國後，深覺西歐各國政府與人民必須應付不少難題，其中若干決非單　美元所能解決。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕國會硏究援歐計劃之特別委員會上週末自歐洲考察歸來，據悉該委員會將向國會提出對歐作某種程度之援助，而數目不致如美官員所要求者之龐大。各代表對援歐時間之緩急與數目之多少，均未能一致。合衆社記者曾訪問六代表中之四人，彼等認爲法國與義大利在目前局勢下，至少能維持至明春，另一代表則謂兩國應儘可能迅速獲得援助，又一代表則對此不表示意見。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕據美國外交官員之意見，法國經濟危局或將於木星期內達於破裂點，美國資助非失之太遲，即杯水車薪，無濟於事。美國主官常局曾於週杪繼續硏究能否以足够美金貸予法國，傳渡難關，而使該國不致於地方選舉前夕完全停止向美購買小麥脂肪及煤。惟此舉希望極微，至多只能設法維持極少數之物資繼續輸入法國。</p>
<h3>英副揆策勵國人促加緊增加生產</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕副首相莫理遜今夜發表演說，聲言除非英國人民在每一方面應付輸出局勢，並盡量利用空餘時間以增產，聯合王國不免在出口戰役中遭遇戰敗。莫氏指出戰後巿塲與戰前情形不同，就種種方面言，出口形勢對英國殊爲不利，故英國必須使英貨保持最佳之品質，否則英國人民生活上之許多享受，將宣告水別。</p>
<h3>美議員主張以廢船援歐　謂可節省一百億美元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕共和黨參議員勃　斯特吿記者稱，渠將促使國會以戰時所造現廢棄於各港口之美船二千萬噸，撥付歐洲各國。渠稱如此可使馬歇爾計劃節省一百億元。</p>
<h3>勃里加丹達併入法版圖</h3>
<p>〔聯合社義大利丹達十二日電〕法義邊界之勃里加與丹達兩區居民，今日舉行公民投票，由國際法庭派瑞士瑞典及荷蘭代表各一人担任觀察，結果以絕大多數表決願成爲法國之一部份。義大利和約本規定以兩地歸倂法國，惟法國憲法禁止未獲當地居民同意而取得其領土。此兩地均有水力發電廠，因此殊爲可貴。</p>
<h3>吧城領事團通過最後報吿書內容　印尼擬派親善使團訪華</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞十三日電〕領事委會今由我總領事蔣家棟任主席之會議中，已通過該會最後報吿之內容。該項報告不僅包括停火命令，並且包括一般情况。該報告明即由中，美，英，比，澳，法六國總領事簽字，並將於十五日由我軍用機於返國途中，就便帶至新加坡，然後再由英機轉送至紐約安理會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞十三日電〕印尼共和國擬派遣一親善使團來華。按本年初李鐵錚特使訪印尼後，共和國即擬派使團來華。</p>
<h3>蘇建議明春撤韓境駐軍　美政府決予拒絕　馬歇爾即將函覆蘇外長</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖十二日電〕美國代表團發言人今日宣稱，國務卿馬歇爾即將答覆蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，聲明美國已將朝鮮問題提交聯合國大會討論，關於撤兵問題亦將在大會中提出建議，加以決定。此種復文無異拒絕莫氏建議朝鮮方面美蘇兩軍明春同時撤退。</p>
<p>蘇聯日時向美提出二次照會，以美國對於蘇聯前此所提撤兵建議，置之不復，表示不滿，並指爲有碍問題之解決，馬氏視已決定以上述意見加以答復。美代表團發言人並稱，關於撤兵間題，美國或將於本星期五左右向大會提出建議，其內容當主張撤兵日期由朝鮮與美蘇兩國，取得聯合國機構之同意，予以共同商定。此外並主張：　選舉朝鮮國民大曾，選舉時由聯合國機構派遣監察團在朝鮮美蘇佔領區監視投票情形是否合乎民主。　由此國民大會推選臨時統一政府，並可請聯合國監察團予以援助。此項建議當由美代表杜勒斯在大會五十七國政治委員會提出，下星期初加以討論。一俟通過，即提付大會最後討論。</p>

<h3>敍軍事行動英提出警吿　埃及否認調動軍隊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社大馬色十三日電〕英駐叙外交代辦以照會一件交敍利亞政府稱，關於英殖民大臣瓊斯所作英國自巴勒斯坦撤退之演說，乃有條件的，同時，英國仍繼續負責維持和平及秩序。敍利亞所採取任何有書巴埠居民之行動，將以對英政府有害視之。敍利亞政府接到照會後，立即集會考慮此一照會。</p>
<p>〔路透社取路撒冷十三日電〕外傳敍利亞軍集中巴勒斯坦北疆，甚至已趨界送攻迦利里區猶太區之說，已經此間權成方而否認。</p>
<p>〔合衆社開羅十三日電〕埃及總參謀長安泰拉，十三日否認埃及軍嚴有任何向巴勒斯坦邊境之移動。渠並否認渠將赴大馬色與其他阿拉伯領袖討論關於進攻巴勒斯坦之軍事行動之消息。</p>
<h3>聖城外國領事館　被投擲炸彈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷十三日電〕耶路撒冷美國領事館前，十三日突發生爆炸案，炸彈在距入口十呎處爆發，因係土製，威力不大，僅本地籍女僱員受傷。警車競赴附近各領館，以防止繼起事件。按在美領館被炸前，英國瑞典兩領館亦曾被　彈爆炸。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷十二日電〕此間波蘭領事館昨夜被　炸彈，鐵門毀壞，但無死傷。是爲最近本市外國領事館遭受襲擊之第二次。</p>
<h3>猶太恐怖份子　圖刺英外相</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十三日電〕倫敦樣準晚報　蘇格蘭塲已破獲晴殺只文外相之陰謀，蘇格蘭密探知悉恐怖份子（殆係猶太恐怖份子），曾計議暗殺貝文，保護貝文之偵察已獲通知，悉恐怖份子將有肯定之行刺企圖，此一報告，一時尚不能證實。記者以此詢貝文，貝文不願表示意見，蘇格關塲亦保持緘默。</p>
<h3>美國反對任何國家　武力脅取伊油田　伊朗對外政策徬徨歧路</h3>
<p>〔合衆社德黑蘭十三日電〕伊朗副總理哈佳諾頃宣稱：總理蘇爾丹納將於下週在議會中提出與蘇聯之石油談判報吿。渠申言蘇丹納在職期間，美國並未與伊朗談判，美國亦不欲伊朗之油田。美國將不反對伊朗以石油界予任何外國，但渠相信美國將反對任何以軍隊或脅迫奪取伊朗油地之企圖。</p>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十二日電〕觀察家相信歐洲九國新共產國際之成立，已使伊朗之政策，尤其是關於合組蘇伊油公司事之政策趨於徬徨。</p>
<p>伊國會迄尙未曾批准規定設立此一油公司之蘇伊協定，而蘇爾丹納總理雖已允諾將向國會提出關於此事之詳細報告，然各方面對於該協定係於蘇軍駐伊時簽訂，是否對伊具有拘束力，尚表懷疑。半官之埃特拉新聞報主張謹傎從事，而擁護伊總理者復一致抨擊共黨最近之行動。</p>

<p>〔合衆社好萊塢十三電〕維辛斯基痛斥爲戰爭販子之美名記者溫却爾十三廣播時聲稱：「余願喚醒美國注意國外之危險。」在莫斯科領導下，九國共產黨組織上週已向美國進行第五縱隊戰爭。「共產軍事間　混入吾人之中，專待乘機下手。君等不願進入再一次之戰爭，而下次之原子戰爭正日近君等。共產區一切資源，均用於戰爭。訓練有素之蘇聯第五縱隊，將奪取歐洲各國之政府。義大利將入其手，使美海軍遠離蘇聯。法國亦將入其手，使蘇聯得以進攻英國。美國若不能召集特別國會，實係「大為失策，而危及舉國之利益。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十二日電〕參議員裴柏在美斯拉夫大會宴會中演說時，提出一世界和平計劃，呼籲普遍裁軍，而由美國以五百億元捐助世界復興。渠稱，世界已越過議爭與和平之十字路口，而直趨引入全體滅亡之道路。張柏詳述其和平計劃稱：渠之世界復興計劃應由聯合國處理，如各國同意立即裁軍至半數，則美國可在五年內每年撥款一百億作世界建設之用。除德日外，各國應撤退各地佔領軍，嚴禁任何強國之干涉他國經濟或政治，所有殖民地與委任統治地均應置於託管理事愈之下，使各民族能不受任何外國之干涉而自由建立其政府。渠稱：此計劃決不使美國破費，蓋目前美國軍費每年達一百億，而每年援助外國之款項則在四十億之講也。</p>

<h3>紗布限期登記逾期查出沒收　市府議決急措置辦法</h3>
<h3>業外人囤棉紗布疋估計約有二三萬件</h3>
<p>（本報訊）紗布市塲昨陷於混亂狀態中，行政院張院長特於昨日上午自南京以長途電話　吳市長速謀有效措置。吳市長即於下午四時邀集紡調會代理主委劉泗英，六區棉紡織業公會理事長王啓字，紡建公司總經理束　章等舉行會議，商討辦法。會後吳市長接見記者發表談話，認爲紗布價格飛漲，係因有人投機國積操縱所致。非加嚴懲，不得抑平，且將影響其他物價。自本年八月至今，紗布價格皆較其他物價所漲爲多。現經決定緊急措置辦法：　由紡調會令知谷紗布行號，複製業，棉布業及堆綫業等，將所存棉紗布疋於十四·十五·十六·十七四天內，向各該同業公會登記，報紡調會備查。逾期不登記之棉紗布疋，一純查出，即認爲國積，予以沒收。　自十四日（今日）起，由　調會加派人員會同經濟警察實行查賬。首查自七月一日起至今受買紗布之戶頭，再查買戶作何用途。如有國積超過一個半月之規定者，即照原價予以收買。如發現有踢皮球者，即依取締日用重要物品囤積居奇辦法，予以沒收或其他處分。　凡經拒絕繳出賬簿或拒絕查賬者，依達警法將該號經理及主管人員拘留七天，而不予罰款。如七天內仍不繳出賬簿者，繼續予以拘留。　　勵密告，依照最近經監會報紗布組通過之辦法給獎。　棉紗因有配價，故對複製業亦由紡調會規定一合理價格。如布疋價格超過此規定價格者，亦予嚴辨。其他查賬等辦法，布疋與棉紗同樣辦理。據吳市長估計，紗布現在非業中人囤積中者，約有二三萬件之多。</p>
<h3>調查各市塲漲風癥結在囤積投機　徐幼詐提供報告書對策</h3>
<p>（本報訊〕警局經濟科長徐幼祚昨會同紡調會視察譚以理調查各市塲情形後，擬具報告書及制止對策，於昨晚由　同長呈送市府，內容計分五類：（甲）</p>
<p>棉布</p>
<p>市塲中昨各幫　吸甚動，　客居聞活躍，多交頭接耳秘密交易。龍頭細布四君子　嘰以及各色布疋，無一不瘋狂上騰原因在於花紗飛漲，廠方因染料及工料提升，執貨售稀，業外商人進吸不止，且該公曾昨復突將成交單廢除，以致行情益亂，實有推波助瀾之嫌。對策：　飭該業公會嚴格厲行成交單制度，如塡報不實可由紡調會照價收購。　抑平棉花及棉紗染料之售價，藉以减輕成本。　取銷居問人制度，免除剝削。　紡調會應嚴飭中紡將棉布供應市面，調劑盈虛。　棉布價格迄今旣無限制，又無議價，布價焉得不漲，應請調節機關速訂有效抑止辦法，警局俾得依據執行。（乙）</p>
<p>棉紗</p>
<p>棉紗市塲因開市稍遲昨表面似未做開，商人仍多交頭接耳，私相交易。二十支又漲二百餘萬，公會負責人時以供求不調爲推詞，但其主因仍爲業內外商人之互相購　或執貨不售，投機者掀風作浪，造成恐慌心理。對策：　消滅棉紗恐慌之心理因素，紡調會應儘量供應市面，使執貨者自願吐售，囤購者不再競購。　厲行成交單制度。　取銷居間商，直接配售與生產者，免中間人之抬價剝削减輕生豫成本。（丙）</p>
<p>人造絲</p>
<p>昨每件突漲千餘萬元實創漲價以來之新紀錄。查人造絲雖爲中信局所配售，但已轉輾流入投機商人之手，視作踢皮球交易。對策：　中信局負人造絲調節之重任，應儘量應市充衡供需。　直接配售予廠商。　嚴格防止配售之人造絲流入黑市。　公會廠嚴格厲行人造絲成交單制度，俾資　考。（丁）</p>
<p>食米</p>

<h3>由山東戰局說道中原戰局</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南八日航訊〕共匪在國內，原有三大根據地：一爲陜北，二爲山東，三爲東北。現在山東又繼陝北之後，所有大河以南地區，除膠東文（登）榮（成）海（陽）三縣外，已悉人國軍堂握。對於共匪慘淡經營逾十年，向被視作「大河以南，大江以北」的黨政軍中心的山東根據地的被摧毀，只要稱稍瞭解共匪內情的人，無不盡知對其創痛之鉅，影響之深。山東戰塲的得失，毫無疑著，在國內戰局中，賦有決定性作用。</p>
<p>共匪爲着針對國軍的淸剿，其作戰指導和戰術思想，在山東較塲上，甚至擴大運用於全國戰塲上的，前後計有三大轉變，亦可說是三大階段。</p>
<p>第一階段</p>
<p>是本年二月廿三日萊蕪之戰以前，這時期共匪的戰略是「以遊擊戰爲主，運動戰爲輔」。毛·朱·劉（伯承）·陳（毅）等的戰略思想是「敵優於我則躲避之，敵劣於我則殲滅之」，故其所奉行的作戰指導原則爲「力避決戰」，而與國軍的「　求決戰」恰相背馳，故即就山東戰塲論，該時期實際上是「戰而不曾」，自然也談不上「決戰」。</p>
<p>第二階段</p>
<p>是以運動戰爲主遊擊戰爲輔，在時間上　，正是本年一月底萊蕪之役起至七月底臨胸之役止，由於共匪繼萊蕪之役後，先後在孟良　（蒙陰東北）及泰安等役佔了若干便宜，認爲只要集中展大兵力，形成局部優勢，向國軍某點或數點施行突擊，一定可以獲得如萊蕪或孟良崮同樣的戰果，因此，在這期間，匪所把握着的作戰規律是「打擊主力，分散主力，凍結主力”消耗主力，」見之於具體行動的是當六月下旬國軍自萊蕪，新秦，蒙陰，由西向東平行推進，直搗魯匪沂蒙山區心臟甫麻，悅莊，東里店等要點時，陳毅不僅不予搶救，反以主力協同新由豫北撤至魯西北於前月廿九日南渡黃河之劉伯承部分別圍攻魯西南的濟南，滕縣，羊山集（金鄉北）鄒縣，兗州，泗水等地，企圖積極的攻佔各該地，消耗國軍，消極的阻滯並牽制東進國軍前進，焉知天下事未有能盡如人意者，共匪於上列各地，所碰上的是一連串的硬釘子，不僅所謀未遂，反由「避戰」而變成送上門來挨打，結果，二十大的戰鬥劉匪的損失，雖不過三萬餘人，而陳匪的損失則至少在七萬人以上，因此，陳毅不得不有些</p>
<p>手忙腳亂</p>
<p>「圍魏救趙」之計未遂後，便不得不以殘餘主力重行北竄，於七月十九日起　攻南麻，企圖搶救山區老巢，但禍不單行的是恰又碰上陳誠最精銳的舊部胡璉部隊，於是三天的大戰，使陳毅又損了三萬餘人，陳毅見攻南麻不克，認爲適於此時由濰縣南下臨朐之李彌部僅是六個團，兵薄可欺，乃又捨南麻而圍臨朐，鏖戰八竇夜，又損失了四萬餘人，至七月卅日國軍增援大軍源源而至，此時再衰三絕的陳毅，已鬥志毫無，深恐全軍覆沒，遂紛紛向黃河北岸逃竄血形成整個書中的大撤退，至此，經過整補號稱廿三萬大軍的陳毅已僅剩七萬餘人，其快速縱隊所有重武器，因無法運過黃河，多掩埋於小淸河膠濟路中間地區，而由關內最慄悍的劉陳二匪所主導的「七月攻勢」，「揭開大反攻序幕」，至此亦由最高潮降落至最低潮了。</p>
<p>第三階段</p>
<p>由於第二階段所受的慘痛敎訓，山東共匪自八月起，直至最近止，所採取的戰略又回復到第一階段。這時期，共匪眼着膠東無法固守，唯一去東北的接濟路錢，在命運上已被註定非被切斷不可，與其都退到黃河北岸挨打，不如以「敵人的後方爲前」，爭取主動，改採「以空易空」戰術，於是侷據魯西南比較完整的劉伯承部五個縱隊，他首先越隴海綫向豫鄂皖邊區流竄，同時晉南陳賡部亦渡過黃河向河洛　擾，以資策應並牽制中原國軍，接着，竄遁黃河北岸補訓尚未成熟的陳毅殘餘主力第一·三·四·六·八·十三等六個縱隊，（此中第十三縱隊係劉伯承部，撥由陳毅指揮者），於由魯西南回竄沂蒙老集未遂後，亦跟著於九月廿六日越隴海路南下，陳毅的企圖原來是回竄蘇北，因遭阻擊，乃西竄與劉伯承合流。</p>
<p>這時，在膠東共開亦喊出了新的口號，那就是：「放棄山東，不放棄膠東，放葉膠東，不放棄三山，放葉三山，不放棄山東靑年。」</p>
<p>所謂三山</p>
<p>是指　東的大澤山，（平度附近），鋸齒牙山，（　霞東南），和崑崙山，（牟平東南），三山就規模言：雖不及沂蒙山區的沂山，蒙山，但其險峻則過之，其中尤以鋸齒牙山爲最險，遠在抗戰期間，共匪即經營之，作爲進出膠東的最大的根據地，其中有天然的山洞，也有人工的隧道，洞洞相通，山山聯防，洞中有兵工廠，糧秣廠，倉庫，尤其倉庫，其所國儲糧彈武器的數字，實無法加以估計，而其工事的堅强，即在抗戰期間敵寇數度大掃蕩，亦未能予以枚平，所幸的此次國軍已首將大澤山共匪全部肅淸，鋸齒牙山全部包圍，至崑崙山之匪，亦不難淸除。</p>
<p>總之，月下殘留在山東的共匪雖尚有正規軍七個縱隊（高密，昌邑間爲第二·九·七·三個縱隊及十三縱隊之一部，十三縱隊主力在崑崙山。魯西南之梁山爲第十，及十一兩縱隊—十一蹤隊係劉部暫撥陳指揮與魯北德州之兩廣縱隊），及地方團隊十萬，這使政府對淸剿殘匪，綏靖地方，仍依然是一</p>
<p>艱鉅工作</p>
<p>（這工作之所以成爲艱鉅，乃由於抗戰勝利後李延年主特山東軍專時將地方游繫隊縮編得一乾二凈，在政府的地方武力未獲全盤重建前，假使國軍正規部隊一旦離開山東時，即各縣城的治安，亦隨時都可發生問題。）但無可疑養的：　陳毅原有主力的被擊潰，　陳毅山東根據地的被拙毀，　劉陳殘餘主力遠離根據地南　，正是國軍脫離核心戰術運用的成功，　劉陳在戰略上被迫仍退到以游擊戰爲主，運動戰爲輔，凡此無一而非共匪的慘重失敗，相反地，共匪的慘重失敗，也正是國軍的勝利成功。</p>
<p>劉伯承自南竄以後，現已正式成立</p>
<p>贛鄂豫皖</p>
<p>軍區，由劉任軍區兼中原野戰軍司令，其原任資冀魯豫軍區，則改由聶榮臻繼任，由此可見至少在劉匪暫時不致主動的他竄，而思有以重建其中原軍區。陳毅雖暫與劉合流，但如能重竄蘇北，固爲其所最渴望的第一着，因蘇北是他的雀巢淮陰所在地，直到現在，陳匪的第十一及十二兩個縱隊約二萬餘人，仍四散潛伏在蘇北，但如有機可乘時，重竄山東，亦甚可能，因爲他的山東軍區司令員迄今依然兼攝着，　　「今歲渡河，明年渡江」，那就完全是共匪的一種實傳攻勢，在關內，現已改以中原戰塲爲主戰塲的國軍正以無比的堅毅和英勇來粉碎共匪的這一企圖。（特派員麗天）</p>

<p>三十六年度招考新生，兩次投考者共二·五二七名，錄取約四分之一，計六六三名，在本學期開學前，全體參加新生訓練，使他們對於學校有深切的認識。</p>
<p>開學第一日的週會，剛從美國歸來的凌校長親自出席主持，他很坦白地說出了上學期潮的癥結，最後，他以極摯誠的語氣說：「我們滬江，是一個大家庭，希望黨派退出，造成一個平靜民主的新滬江。」</p>
<p>大家庭的作風在滬江，的確已有充分的表現，曾經爲了一次男生膳堂飯菜洗滌不愼，激起了一次小小風波，凌校長旋以民主的作風，在一次週會中宣佈：「我接到了封很多男同學署名的來信，他們告訴我飯菜的不潔，使半數以上的同學患了腹瀉，我願意澈查這件事！」結果，男生廚房加以撤換，同時，由同學們組織了一個膳食委員會加以管理。</p>
<p>九月廿二日晚上，在大禮堂舉行了一次盛大的師生聯歡會，全體敎職員偕同夫人出席。節目中以音樂系敎授朱啓東夫人的「電氣琴」獨奏，最博讚賞，琴韻似古箏，又似弦琴。那天師生盡歡，情緒十分融洽。</p>
<p>中秋節晚間，理學院長兼生物系主任鄭章成博士所設計之植物園，舉行揭幕式，滬江管弦樂隊等，並有音樂節目，對此花好月圓，聊慰同學思家之念。生物園濱臨黃浦，樹木暢茂，荷池小橋，約略點綴，課餘飯後，又多了一個遊憇談心的盛地，同學們莫不引爲欣幸。</p>
<p>十一月八日，爲校慶紀念，預備舉行懇親會，共伸慶祝，現在已着手籌備，校園裏面除同學會捐植花木外，並開始建築噴水池，日規台，飲水泉等。</p>
<p>科學館中的煤氣設備，已經裝置完竣了。年來經數度交涉的化學系學生，莫不認爲天大喜訊，對於今後實騐，增加使利不少，一俟鍋爐修理完畢，就可自產煤氣，供給全校應用，於節電聲中，這又是一個好消息。江南造紙廠總經理陳彭年先生所捐贈的造紙機器一套，已安置在造紙工塲內，近數日正日夜試車，即將正式開工，化三同學尤感興奮，現正添購工衣，滿臉春風。</p>
<p>物理系同學，不願生物系與化學系專美於前，現在新設氣象預測，眞個相與媲美。</p>
<p>敎育系同學所主辦的義務小學，成績卓著，已加以擴充，敎職員子弟以及附近鄉村的失學兒童，均得就近入學；這和社會系同學的實習所—滬東公社，共稱做滬大兩大義舉。</p>
<p>三十六年度新聘敎職員多位，適今夏動工的三層敎職員公寓落成，內部衛生設備完整，外形壯麗，爲校內現有公寓有最崇高的一座，全部造價爲美金七萬餘元，使全校添了新生氣象　女生佔「思雷」「思孟」兩堂，男生大一住思伊堂，大二住思裴堂，大三及大四住「男生宿舍」，英文名就是Women's　Hall。</p>
<p>學校當局對於同學的課外活動和運動，都很注意，上屆會連得「國語演講」，「英語演講」，男子田徑，和女子籃球四項冠軍，奠定滬江聲譽，所以最近校內已經開始舉行種種競騫，以作未來的準備。</p>
<p>凌校長此次赴美，向敎會方面報告滬大近况，並出席丹京浸禮大會，講演我國敎育現狀，除在美國接受名譽博士學位外，並參觀英美各大學，藉資借鏡。我們期望他能本着年青人的魄力（凌校長爲年紀最輕的大學校長），繼續發展滬江，使它成爲全滬第一流的高等學府！</p>

<h3>自備外匯口貨物　處理辦法即可公佈</h3>
<p>關於自備外匯進口物資處理，昨據輸管會發當人稱：政府對此項問題，即可解決，對於已結匯之進口貨，已無問題。尤以工業原料將獲優先便利，現政府　慮者，係已進口而未結　之貨物，恐一旦開放，勢非向黑市搜購不可，而對最近匯市之波動深具戒心，故輸管會與行政院之間稍有不同意見，惟項處理辦法，短期內當可公佈。</p>
<h3>華南輸管會考慮通天證</h3>
<p>香港通天證之使用，曾引起香港市塲之波動。上月廿二日，華南海關即停止使用，經僑商請求，本月二日又准上月廿一百以前所發出者，仍屬有效。因此通天證又使各方繼續角逐。</p>
<p>頃據輸管會負責人談：關於通天證情形，目前宋接任何報告，查所調通天證者，原係華南輸出入管委會及海關，爲便利邊境商民販運牲畜蛋類等，免稅免結匯運至港地銷售，同時將所售港幣，購間同樣幣値之應用物資，由海關簽發之「農產品交換輸入證」，立意至善。惟被一般特殊人物予以利用，紛紛搶購，購買進口物資，遂成爲通天證，殊出當時意料。此種情形，正由華南輸管會與海關作有效之措置，是否繼續簽發，亦由華南輸管會決定。</p>
<h3>改進棉紗議價制度　辦法仍在商討中　配紗維持原價黑市暴漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會現有棉紗議價制度，雖採機動方式，惟以與日來狂漲之紗價相較，仍不無脫節。國行張總裁曾於上週間，召集棉紡界代表談及改進現有議價制度，並經決定，與經部陳部長會商後，決定改進辦法。茲陳部長業於昨日抵滬，據語記者：議價制度之改進問題，刻仍考慮中，未有定論。　昨日紡調會棉紗　價，維持不動，廿支紗仍掛一五二〇萬元。</p>
<p>紗價狂漲</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市塲，經濟警察（蒞臨監視，務使各紗在限價之外，加百分之五合法利潤做交易，詎一般投機分子，到者甚少，致無正式交易，轉呈停頓狀態。惟塲外則仍有零星喊價，開其漲勢更烈，四二支監鳳細紗迫近四千萬大關，喊三千九百萬元。四十支三千四百五十萬，卅二支銀月三千萬元，廿支雙馬二千五百五十萬，十六支光明二千五百萬元，大都步升二三百萬元不等。　又訊：紡建公司循例開紗，價無變動。計甲組複製品廠商十種，一五五〇件，每件除牌價外，另加水災賬費廿五萬元，申購者九二二戶。乙組紗號商則本期停配云。</p>
<p>棉布疾升</p>
<p>棉布市况，初開因游資及客戶頻有扒吸，各方人心以原料狂漲，一致石高。廠家不開，籌碼益稀，市勢扶搖直上。十二磅龍頭細布，由九十二萬五千一躍竟達九十九萬元，尚難收進，較週六猛　十三萬元。其餘各檔細布，亦均狂升一二十萬元不一。嗣因經濟警察　塲監視，塲內空氣頓　渙散，賣買停頓。惟塲外龍頭細布價喊一百零三萬元，四君子嘰嘰一百二十三萬元，乏正式成交。其他漂布斜紋色布土林布一致疾升，自五六萬至卅五萬不等。</p>
<p>現棉緊俏</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况混亂，喊價不一，紗廠均多觀望，同業稍有做開。靈資最高價爲四九〇萬，較上週六又挺四十萬，其餘各檔均挺，惟成交不多。送　價做開沙市四八五萬，棧交價靈竇做開四七二萬至四九〇萬，漢粗三六二萬，漢細四五〇萬至四六五萬，火機三七〇萬三八〇萬，成交九〇〇包，周浦籽花七二萬。</p>
<h3>當局否認發行大票</h3>
<p>際此物價高漲，民生困苦之時，市上忽傳國行爲適應目前需要，確擬印製五萬元及二萬元大票之說，更予市上以重大刺激。據向有關方面探詢究竟，咸認絕無此事，且現尚無需要，均一律加以鄭重否認。蓋不久以前，市上亦有同樣發行大票之傳說。業經國行發言人予以否認。不料爲時未久，謠言又起，有關當局對於故放　言者，將予追究云。</p>
<h3>米市漲風熾烈　高粳叩八十大關　食油繼續拋售價仍奔騰</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬五千二百餘石，南市早市漲風甚烈，高粳一度迫近八十大關，午時急轉直下，形成猛淮疾退，結局軋升二三萬元，白元亦加一二萬元，北市先疲午堅，收盤銷化活潑，盤升一二萬元，市形起伏不定。</p>
<p>麵粉動盪尚少，見挺六七千元。麩皮供不匯求，飛漲二萬元，小包亦然猛加萬元。豆餅交易平常，挺進六七千至八九千元不一。黃豆油廠本街吸收甚力，逐步奔騰，再漲三五萬元，　豆南洋去化活躍，猛漲五六萬元。蠶豆另化甚殷，再漲二四萬元，已越五十萬大關。</p>
<p>莞豆汕頭續進，步漲三四萬元。缸豆南洋去　接連，續漲五六萬元。紅糧散戶收購，酒坊甚貪，續昂二三萬元。苞米北洋　聯，再加三四萬元，芝蔴本街銷路熱鬧，洋莊略動，靑雲直上，步漲六七萬元。生仁廣方續吸，本街亦然猛收，扶搖直上，繼續奔飛八九萬元，已越百萬大關。</p>
<p>油市貨頭甚稀，做開甚少，無正式價格，續見奔騰一二十萬元不一，中植油廠繼續拋出，廠方配售豆油生菜油熱菜油，共計五桶一家，均由零售商認　，價格一不動。</p>
<h3>羢綫暢銷價漲</h3>
<p>昨日裁綫市面，因天氣漸　，本外埠去化奇暢，塲內買氣蓬勃，做價瘋狂上升。四股頭各牌細羢綫，每磅漲至七十二萬元，比上週狂躍十四萬元。粗羢綫「蜂房皇后英雄地球變貓」等牌，每磅漲至六十萬元，猛升十二萬元。「雙洋小　學生」等牌，每磅四十萬元，上揚六七萬元，金錢牌升七萬，價爲卅萬八元。</p>
<h3>人絲喊價再高</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市異常混亂，因當局監視甚嚴，塲內未聞做開。上午塲外喊價在八千五百萬元左右，下午竟高至九千三百萬元有成交，新高價層出不窮，令人咋舌。最後因傳說貸歉已成，人心較軟，卒降至八千九百萬元賣出價。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市亦形紊亂，五担頭各級均乏喊價，人絲狂升，故莫不堅持居奇。另担略有成交，價在六千入百萬至七千萬元之間。千經亦跟隨上升，下午高另担喊價已達五千萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市交易稀少</h3>
<p>自本市物價起巨大波動後，茶葉市况，執貨者心思亦不甘再伏，對於紅總茶花色，一味看漲，供　　頻頻轉稀。而本街店莊及蘇錫等地之實需買戶，雖仍前來問津，交易卒告銳落，趨勢則更堅化，行情續吐秀氣。他若各種外銷茶，亦復如此，市面頗爲岑靜，綜觀此種情形，前途恐猶有向榮之望。</p>
<h3>北方交通時有阻礙　影響煤斤運輸　煤價上漲綠於供應反常</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據燃管會息：北寗路綫山海關唐山間，自上月下旬以來，鐵路破壞頻仍，行駛時斷時續，間須維持軍運，致運煤量說减。本月八日秦島來電，本會正在　處裝煤之船有「唐山」等五艘，臨時奉該地軍事常局令停裝應差，十日方駛回，影響煤運至鉅。又本曾「天行」「南山」兩輪，抵台後亦被徵應差，至本月初方准放行，影響台煤到數。</p>
<p>靑島軍公用煤之供應，本會按月均有增加。本月預定一萬五千噸，最近因　煤來源受阻，致預定運春煤斤，亦不能按時運到。現除令已經載煤在途之新中國輪，趕赴靑島，計載煤七千二百噸，內以三千噸撥交中紡公司，四千二百噸撥交電廠。並已令台北輸在秦島裝足煤斤五千噸，即運靑島。</p>
<p>現悉：該處煤廠用煤，可以維持至本月十七日，再經本曾派輪運煤供應，靑島絕無停電之虞。又北寗路近經不斷勞力搶修，路運已於十日起恢復常態，一方面並已呈經部咨有關當局，對於運煤船舶，免予徵用。</p>
<p>又本市各軍公用煤，從未間斷。雖一般運煤，到滬時生故障，而本會供應，尚塲維持。且自開放廠商准許自運個煤以來，最近二週自運煤斤到滬者，計共一萬八千噸以上。故煤斤市價之上漲，實綠於供求反常。現工廠煤第四期已自一萬五千噸增加至二萬噸，不日即可配出，預料煤斤價格，不久可復常態云。</p>
<h3>游資掀風作浪　華股猛升疾回</h3>
<p>華股昨忽現普遍漲風，尤以次熱及雜牌爲更甚。良以當局對各市塲監視更嚴，活動者遂大量滲入華股，午刻突告激漲，漲停板者達十分之七八，午後銀根告緊，借款又有傳說，各股高騰後急切回跌。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>見秀，開後一六〇號等買進，一八八號等買現永紗，而升至即交三三三元，遞交三三六元。二〇二號等趁高脫手而稍盤，美亞漲風甚熾，經一一七號等爭購而大俏。永紗復由二二三號等進至三三五元及三四〇元，商務首先由一一六號掛漲停，而信和亦由一五二號吸納而轉挺。十時半後，因塲外息價開高至二角二分半及二角七，經一〇七雖等賣出現永紗，二〇二號等亦了結遞永紗，曾回小五六元。榮　由一五七號等掛高至漲停，中絲由二一九號，新亞內衣景綸均由二三一號掛高至限度，一時買風大盛，各業市塲遭常局嚴禁活動，大批游資湧來，近午一五四號等咸進，永紗漲到即交三五〇元，遞交三五八元高價，中法閘北統益火柴本泥以及現美亞信和均迫近限度，一七一號乘高力售現永紗，而後以三五〇元及三五七元之價收市，結果較上週六計即交股美亞中法閘北統益榮　景綸商務火柴水泥新亞內衣中絲漲停，信和華　新光華新漲一成半，永紗中紡新華升一成，景福升半成，恒　微升。遞交股計美亞漲停，永紗信和升一成，華總新光景福漲成半。</p>
<p>後市</p>
<p>晨收之餘風，上塲見昂，閘北商務榮豐麗安中絲中法等仍見漲停，惟永紗見三五七元及三六二元後，即有獲利了結者，七六號等脫手，二三四號等賣現永紗，回小至三四九元及三五一元。美亞仍由一一七號等掛高至漲停，一二六號等趁低吸收，四五號等買現永紗，而升至三五三元及三五八元。後傳夜報有美貸款原則上已獲同意，及國行交換差進，銀根見緊，脫手者較多，三二號等脫手，七六號等又賣現永紗，逐步下挫至三一二六元及三三八元低價，一一六號等趁低尚納，永紗遂回升至三四三元及三四五元之價收市，結果較晨收即交股計永紗華　新光景福山法新華新亞火柴榮　微挫，恒豐中紡信誼微升，信和美亞統益景綸內衣跌半成光景，商務由絲閘北　安漲停，遞交股計美亞華　新光跌半成，餘均微挫。塲外各老股若中華世界浦東五洲冠生園等各升一成，餘者微升至半成不等。</p>
<h3>統債買氣仍濃外股俏後有回</h3>
<p>公債昨激動買氣，啓旋趨榮，五〇三室雖出，大成新五五〇室五五二室則進。統丙晨開一五五〇〇〇元，自一五四〇〇元升至一六七〇〇元，而後轉徘徊之局，結果較上週六計甲乙升八百元，丙漲一千元，丁戊好起六百元，成交約四百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨仍向高峯邁進，但俏後有回，怡紗晨初自一八八〇〇〇元，升至二十萬大關，而後回降萬元掙扎。英聯自二十六萬外回小至二四五〇〇〇元左右結束，證券帮銀行帮有買，洋行帮及廣帮則出，結果較上週六計怡啤漲半成，墾植升一成，會德　業廣電話平平，餘股榮辱俱微。</p>
<h3>蠶絲產銷會開會</h3>
<p>蠶絲產銷協導委員會，於昨日下午二時，在該會會議室舉行第二十五次會議。譚　鴻主席，首先報告春絲收購數量，及蠶絲管理處工作概况，次討論提案而散</p>
<h3>卷烟肥皂又升</h3>
<p>昨日卷煙，晨開因有派貨，同行拋吐，浮多出籠，市乃下挫。午市場內買戶活躍，行情復升。</p>
<p>日用品肥皂晨開微回，午市較活，固本剪刀光華茂牛脾等皂均軋升。火柴新鳳凰美麗俱漲，雜牌貨亦見上揚。</p>

<h3>漫談上海電話</h3>
<p>— 王大椿</p>
<p>一，兩種不同制度的電話造成了許多缺點</p>
<p>上海市內電話，以前是交通部上海電話局與美商上海電話公司兩機構分別經營。上海電話公司的營業區域，包括舊公共租界及法租界，以及北四川路滬西的越界築路地區，其機械採出旋轉自動制。上海電話局區域，包括上述地區以外的市區，其機械採用步進自動制。勝利後，上海電信局接收了僞「華中電氣通信公司」的「上海電話總局」，將被佔的電話公司部份，交還原主，屬於前上海電話局的，劃蹄黨信局，一切制度，悉仍其舊。電話公司經營商業繁盛之區，現有用戶五萬八千餘號，設分局九個，其電話號碼排列如下：</p>
<p>中央局「一」字自動式電話容量九千三百號</p>
<p>虹橋局「二九」字人工共電式電話容量三百十號</p>
<p>江蘇局「二」字人工共電式電話容量四千一百號</p>
<p>西局「三」字「六」字及「六二」自動式電話容量一萬一千九百號</p>
<p>又「六二」半自動式電話容量七百號</p>
<p>北局「四」字自動式電話容　六千八百號</p>
<p>匯山局「五」字自動式電話容量三千三百號</p>
<p>汾陽局「七」字自動式電話容量九千九百號</p>
<p>又「六八」半目動式電話容量一千號</p>
<p>雲南局「八」字自動式電話容量八千六百號</p>
<p>福建局「九」字自動式電話容量八千號</p>
<p>上海電信局電話，現有用戶約四千號，設分局八個，其電話號碼排列如下：</p>
<p>市中心局「五」字自動式電話容量六百號</p>
<p>虹口局「六」字自動式電話容量二千六百號</p>
<p>南市局「七」字自動式電話容量一千號</p>
<p>龍華局「七四」人工共電式電話容量一百二十號</p>
<p>浦東局「七五」人工共電式電話容量三百號</p>
<p>傎茹局「六四」人工磁石式電話容量五十號</p>
<p>吳淞局「六五」人工磁石式電話容量五十號</p>
<p>復興島局「六六」人工共電式電話容量六十號</p>
<p>因兩機構電話制度的根本不同，雙方接綫手續的煩綏，無可避免，最大的缺點，爲雙方均用五位制，彼此之用戶號碼，雷同者甚多，如公司汾陽局有七〇七三一，電信同南市亦有同樣號碼，假定，不用特殊之接綫手續，則用戶撥打公司汾陽局之七〇七三一，勢將誤接至南市。同樣的，用戶撥打公司西局半自動電話六二二三三號，必被誤接至虹口，造成絕大的錯誤。再因雙方制度之不同，彼此機械，不能互用，即欲截長補短，亦爲事實所不許，致供應電話發生困難。</p>
<p>二，「〇二」與「撥〇」</p>
<p>因上海電信局電話與美商上海電話公司電話程式之不同，彼此用戶間通話，不能直接撥號，須用特殊的接錢手續，即「〇二」接綫與先　「〇」字，此項辦法，係自電話公司至電信局間，裝置「〇二」接綫台，派有話務員値　接綫，該台通至市中心局有中繼綫二十對，至虹口吳淞傎茹復興屬各局八十對，至南市龍華浦東各局七十對，電話公司用戶接打「〇二」電話，統由此項交換台接綫，在繁忙時，假定，打至虹口「六」字電話，同時有八十家以上的，就要聽到佔綫聲了。至於，電信局通至電話公司，並不另設交換臺，僅利用自動機空位「〇」字，在中縱綫上裝置複述器，由用戶光撥「〇」字，複述　即將其脈電直接送至公司之選擇器，供給公司表軌　，以待撥號。所以「〇二」用戶撥打公司電話，須等候兩次表軌聲，光聽到電信局表軌聲後，撥動「〇」字，再聽到公司表軌聲後，方可撥號，則不致錯誤。現在南市通至公司中　綫爲一百對，虹口通出一百二十五對，市中心通出二十五對，在現行狀態下，應　需要，但在　間業務繁忙時，仍不免遭受佔綫耳。</p>
<p>三，佔錢的原因</p>
<p>吾人打電話時，每聽到佔綫的「嗡嗡」聲，在需要接通一電話，而聽到佔統聲常引起心緒上的煩燥，然而，在上海這樣的大都市，電話用戶已有六萬戶以上，打電話遇到佔綫，固無可避免的。現在上海全市電話局，大小有十七個之多，在局與局之間，各用中繼綫數百對至一千數百對連接，當用戶撥打第一個號碼時，除與本電話號碼首字相同者外，均須先經過此種中繼綫，對達被呌用戶所屬的電話局後，再　絞選錢。假定，第七二三八二號用戶，欲打第四二三三三號，常其撥首位「四」字後，脈電感動「七」字位汾陽局首組選擇器後，即經中繼綫，直達「四」字位北局之次組選擇器，然後再接受二三三三等撥號脈電，終接至被呌用戶，此項自汾陽局至北局之中繼綫，現有六百對，而該兩局用戶，合計約一萬五千號——汾陽局約九千六百號，北局約四千四百號——其互通電話，均須經由此六百對往來，在同一時間內，互通電話有六百家以上，其後來者，即將聽到佔綫聲了。現在上海商業繁盛區各電話局，如中央福建兩局間，中央四局間，福建西局間，中繼綫均各有一千對以上，住宅區各電話局，如西局至江蘇局，又至汾楊局問，亦各有中繼綫八百對，但以用戶時增，通話類繁，遭受佔綫，殆不可免。至電信局所屬之南市虹口兩局問，亦有中繼綫五十對，本年又增加經過電話公司區域之直接綫二十對，兩局通話，情形較好，更有進者，用戶雙方通話，常因商業談判，歷時甚久，或有情話綿綿，久不終話，中繼綫被佔甚久，使後來者，無法通過中繼綫，這也是使人聽到佔綫聲的另一原因。</p>
<p>四，合理化的基本改良</p>
<p>欲音改良上海電話，首要點是以劃一制度爲主題，現在上海的兩種電話制度——旋轉式與步進式——各有其優點，但以旋轉式電話容量，約二十倍於步進式，就改良時的成本而言，宜以改用旋轉式爲合算，縱觀上海市將來的發展，市區與郊區之輕重權衡，雖尚未能確定，但欲應付將來電話之進展，必須採用一種富有伸縮性之制度，囚旋轉式有記錄轉譯（Register-Translstor）之特點，富有伸縮性，在技術的觀點，無論將來之發展如何，即全市採用旋轉自動式後，改良計劃，可毫不受其牽制，而經濟方面亦無浪費之虞，且慶轉式因用記錄轉譯，容量較大，局間中繼綫路之支配，亦可經濟，尤其相距甚遠之兩局，可用　接中繼法（Tandem　Trunking），不必設置路綫甚長而佔用不忙之直接中繼綫，此種中繼法，可能减經通話成本，供給價慶優美之服務，使全市民衆得多享受電話之供給，但實施此項改良計劃，須先調整兩點：</p>
<p>行規定各局塊區。在先兩機構之營業區域，因電話公司專利前兩租界範圍致各局用戶之繁疏，絕不平均，中區各局，轄地甚小，用戶繁密，需要機鍵較多，郊區塊廣人稀，用戶寥落而綫路綿長，彼此之裝機區域，更有交叉者，對於綫路之分布，實不相宜。改良計劃內，是宜將全市各局，規　合理之營業區域，使用戶裝機，得平均發展。</p>
<p>電話號碼之改制。現在全上海電話，均取五位制，因兩機構各有相同之首位字，不得不採用特殊之接綫乎續，發生許多缺點，他日制度劃一後，取消「〇二」與撥「〇」，須改用六位撥號制，其格式，曾經專家硏究，以用六個字數，在前二字與後四字問，加一知　如21-1234，73-1234等，可使用戶易於記憶，現在改良計劃，固經雙方技術人員數度計劃，特以機械購置不易，經濟財力尤須先期籌劃，欲觀　成，尚須相當時日。</p>
<h3>怎樣拍發新聞電報</h3>
<p>— 刁治炳</p>
<p>我是一個電信從業員，同時也是工作在新聞界中的一名小卒。因此，每日在我班上所經手的千百封包括尋常，加急，特快，交際，夜信及軍官等電報當中，使我最注意的自然是新開電報了。</p>
<p>上海新聞事業的發達，位於全國之冠，報館林立，加上外埠報紙駐滬的特派員和外籍記者，每日自滬發出去的新開常報就很可觀了。這些電報在量興質兩方面說來都是够多　好的，而且，大多其備着重要性和時間性；所以，每當我收下這種電報時，總是用高速度來處理它們，希望能够趕上它們的報紙的出版時間，以免延誤，而喪失其新聞價値。</p>
<p>在我兩個多月來的工作中，所經辦過的新開電報，大多是合乎理想規定的，處理起來非常容易，不需要一個鐘頭就可傳達對方。舉個例來說從南京發往上海的洋文新聞電報，過去要費三四小時，自八月份起，已縮短爲一小時左右到達。而上海的處理時問，不足三十分鐘，這表示上海電信局對於新聞電報處理效率之高了。惟有少數因字跡潦草，電碼模糊，增减或塗改之處太多，造成收發電報工作上的困難，以致影響其正確和時間上的無謂損失。我們有時在報上看見括弧內寫着「電文不明」「專電未到」，或因等候電稿而延誤報紙出版時間等情形，實在可惜得很。再舉一個最近的事實來作例子；當魏德趨將軍抵滬時，外埠某報駐滬記者，採訪得魏氏當日下午趨訪孫夫人，並接兌各黨派人士　社曾賢達等重要新聞，寫成電文，深夜命人前來拍發，但他在行文時太倉卒了，竟將電報掛號遺　，而且，電文電碼亦極模糊，很難辨認，往返詢問改正，躭誤兩側鐘點，結果未能趕上該報的出版時問，明日黃花，新聞變爲歷史。一寸光陰一寸金，兩小時的　貴時間傎是難以計算其價値，一時慌忙疏忽，鑄成了無法補償的損失。</p>
<p>基於上國的理由，我到對道種事實提出重要的幾點來請新聞界朋及們合作，注意改善，以期爭取時間，提高工作效率，消滅這種不必要而又無法彌補的損失。這樣，不僅與人方便，而且於自己也方便。</p>
<p>請用本局或自即的去報紙書寫，小格寫字，大格譯碼。</p>
<p>務請繕寫淸楚，勿在電文內塗改，以免紊亂不淸。</p>
<p>量好用鋼筆或毛筆寫，鉛筆亦可，惟須明　入目，避免潦草模糊。</p>
<p>最好自譯電碼，否則午夜以前送遂，午夜以後，人手缺乏，新聞電又非常普通一般電報可比，均係洋洋長　數百數千字者，譯電需時過長，以致不能及平發出。</p>
<p>發電人務須持電信總局准予拍發新聞電報之派司，以憑騐證。</p>
<p>電報上報館加蓋　記，記者簽名蓋章。</p>
<p>因爲新聞電報而不免使人聯想起一般電報。一般電報常見的錯誤是！</p>
<p>寫地名。</p>
<p>漏寫電報掛號。</p>
<p>寫發報人姓名住址。</p>
<p>宋按小格寫字大格譯碼之方式書寫。</p>
<p>電文內夾有未　成電碼之字。</p>
<p>電文潦草，儉筆字太多。</p>
<p>最近我們正在從事於電信大革新，務使特快電報不得超過一小時半，加急電報不得超過四小時，尋常電報不得超過八小時到達。憑着我們主觀上的努力，事實證明已經接近這個標準，如果在客觀上大家注意上面列舉的錯誤而加以改善，則必能縮短更多的時間，减少錯誤，達到準確和迅速的境地。</p>
<h3>蘇聯電信計劃</h3>
<p>一九四六年三月蘇維埃最高委員會決定蘇聯新五年電信計劃（自一九四六至一九五〇年）。在此計劃中，有：利用最新技術，恢復及擴充曾被德軍佔領區域之無綫電通信。建設莫斯科與各行政中心間及各共和國首都與其行政中心間之可靠電報電話交通。恢復及數設主要電報電話電纜七千公里。裝置無綫電報電話發射機五十五架，其中二十架懸設立於蘇聯中部，藉以加强遠東·加架克斯坦·中亞細亞·高加索等處之通訊。擴充各電局之日動電話設備。添設廣播電台二十八座。恢復及改造莫斯科電視站並添設列寗格拉基輔及斯凡洛佛斯克三電視站。（凡）</p>
<h3>「公衆」和「電信」</h3>
<p>— 李季淸</p>
<p>電信是一種公用事業。所以電信上的一切設施改進，都應該拿「公衆」做對象。最近電信局實行的各種新辦法，目的就是完全要使「公衆」發電報和打電話得到更多的便利和迅速。相反，公衆對於電信局的態度，應該怎樣呢？照我們的看法，似乎應該像下面所說的：</p>
<p>不客氣的督促改善　電信局對於電報電的話處理辦法，目下正在天天求進步改善。但是因爲受了人力物力財力等種種限制，辦理不能盡善盡美的地方，還是很多。除了電信局自己隨時注意努力改進外，還希望公衆盡量督促指導。遇到有不對的地方，請不客氣的告知電信局，電信局對於這種意見或建議，一定要誠　的接受，想法子把牠們一一辦到。</p>
<p>請　量利用電報電話　常信局對於電報電話的種種設備，和各種新實行的辦法，是歡迎公衆儘量利用和批評。公衆兪多利用，電信局自然愈多「動腦動」，設法使公衆享受到更多的便利。現在電報電話的收費，比較一般物價而論，還是很便宜，諸位對於遠地的親戚朋友，去一張電報或者和他們通一個長途電話，一定會獲得意想不到的效果！</p>
<p>「公衆」和「電信」，是現代生活中不可片刻分離的。我們懇切希望「公衆」對於「電信」，要時常督促指導，大量利用。電信局對於「公衆」，自然應當竭誠接受他們的指導和批評，時時刻刻把電報電話設法積極改善，去爲他們謀便利迅速。這樣彼此互相協助，是求取進步的員好辦法。</p>
<h3>電信常識講話</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>第三講　怎樣選用特別業務</p>
<p>電局給予顧客的通常服務是山發報局（即發報人所在地的電局）把交發的電報根據交到先後，依次拍裝，經直遠電路直接或徑中間局（發報局與收報局間幷無道江電路者，有時必須經過一個或一個以上的中間局接轉）間接拍至收報局（則收報人所在地的電局），然後再由收報局依照收到的次序，加　電對幷對好後，派報差依照當地路徑，順路投送給收報人。這裏所講的「特別業務」，是指顧客願出相當代價，要求電局在通常服務以外，給予更迅速，更妥善，更週到，更便利的服務，或顧客寗願將所發電　　在照通常服務應該輸到的次序之後，傳遞和投送。或密願接受電局規定的某種限制，以取得低價的優待。拿郵信來做此喻，如果我們把郵局對於平信的服務作爲通常服務，那末，交寄航空信或快信應該是屬於發信人要求給予更迅速的服務的特別業務，掛號信和保險信應該是屬於發信人要求給予更週到更妥善的服務的特別業務，開發郵政匯票和代辦書報等業務是郵局給予發信人更便利的服務的特別業務，交寄明信片和印刷物是發信人寗願受郵局對容量或內容的限制，以取得减低郵資的優待的特別業務。</p>
<p>當找們在寄發郵信的時候，除屬於通常服務的平信之外，都須由發信人在信封左上角加寫「航空」，「快遞」，「單掛號」，「　掛號」，「印刷物」等等字樣，或加貼郵局特別印製的各種小標　；同例，凡發報人交發屬於通常服務的尋常電報以外，或報類雖爲羣常電報血發報人要求電局在傳議戰投送時給予比通常服務更週到，更妥善，或更便利的服務的各種電報，都得在電文起首部份（即收報人名址之前）加寫一電局特定的標識，這種標識，稱爲納費業務標識，簡稱納費標識。</p>
<p>在　一封郵信裏，寄信人可以同時選用兩種或兩種以上性質不相扺觸的特別業務，例如「航空快遞」或「航空快遞印刷物」或航空快遞而又附有匯業的信件；同例，在電報裏，如發報人認爲需要·也可以在同一電報內選用兩種或同種以上不相祇觸的特別榮務，例如「加念，預付回電費」，「加　，校對，分送」等等。</p>
<p>適用在國內電報裏的各種特別業務，屬於要求更迅速的服務的如特快（標識LTN），加急（標識D），屬於减價方而的如夜信（標識NLT），交際電（標識SLT）等等，上面各種特別業務的目的和效用，已在第二講內約略說明，本講不　述，這裏，讓我們把屬於要求給予更妥善，更週到，和更便利的服務的各種特別業務，分別說明如下：（第三　未完）</p>
<h3>電報通信網的心臟：中央室剪影</h3>
<p>— 兪昂霄</p>
<p>上海電信局的無綫電發報機，是設置在南翔發報台，收報機則在劉行收報台。二處均以電纜與福州路總營業處互相連繫，而介乎二者之間的一個部門—「中央室」，顧名思義，就知道它是電報通信的「中心控制站」，充份顯出了它的重要性。</p>
<p>中央室是一個純技術性的機構，負有與收發報台及福州路報房之間互通聲氣的使命，保管並改進福州路局全部機　　備的責任。在主管工程師下，由有錢及無綫工程師分別執黨其事，然後再分出「無綫調整室」，「有錢調整室」，「總修機空」，無綫及有綫「報房修機室」，以及「馬遠發電機室」，「蓄電池室」，「汕機發電機室」等。可謂「化整爲零」，分工合作，面面俱到矣。</p>
<p>無錢及有綫調整室，也可以說是無綫電報及有綫電報的「終端機室」，是中央宇屬下工作最重要的部分，作用相當於一個人身體上的心臟，是收發報綫路的集散　　。凡是由劉行收報臺收聽得來的各地無綫電訊號，先由電纜通到無綫調整室的接錢扳上，經過調整室的放大器，再接到報房的錄號機上讓報務員收錄；通信檯上發出去的訊號，也是光接到調整室，再由調整室有系統地接到發報台的發射機上。有綫調整室除了管理載波機外，常然更是「樣」的世界，傎是「干頭萬緒」，盡在手下邊。所以在調整室値班的技術負，彷彿是以「經紀人」的姿態出現的，他們必須負責通知收發機的「開出」或「關閉」，波長之調換，聲音之調整，試驗報房自動機制準確與否，測騐各地綫路之良好與否，如有損壞，又須斷定損壞之地段，如何處置……「經紀人」在電話繁忙的時候，錄聲不絕，應接不暇，一二個人値班，比交易所還緊張。</p>
<p>無錢調整室預防到南翔去的綫路萬一損壞，今春試騐以超短波來「遙控」。超短波的好處就在他可以「滿載而歸」，一隻小小的超短波機，再附上一隻載波機，已足够代替十餘條遙控綫，可以同時將許多訊號「空運」到南翔的發報機上去。不過起初試騐時，在這麼一個充滿高樓的上海，對於「定向天錢」的設計與裝置，不免費去了一番苦心，到現在却已經有了　著的成功了。一旦「南翔綫」某某號數根損壞，就只要不慌不忙開出超短波機運用，對於通報效率上，實有莫大的貢獻。</p>
<p>總修機室簡直是小到的工廠中：車床鉗床，各式俱備。有毛病的機件，如打字機，　孔機，錄號機，都在這裏「治療」。報房條機室是他們的「分廠」，每天每時有川流不息的「壞東西」送進去，「好東西」送出來。至於有關複雜的無錢電部份，經常由技術員佐隨時處理外，也有由工程師親自出馬，「妙手回春」的。</p>
<p>另外還值得一提的，便是電報的「靈魂」所在——電力供給。我們知道中央室有各種不同的機件，是需要電來維持活動能力的，而它們對於「吃電」的「胃口」得大小，也是各各不同，中央室有兩個經常供給電源的地方：一個是馬達發電機室，由電力公司供給的是三百八十伏脫的「電力電」，然後再由電馬達「發出」一百十伏脫的直流電供給報房自動機及　孔機之用，一百八十伏脫的直流電供給電鍵之用，二百廿伏的和一百十伏交流電供給放大器，檢聽用收報機，及錄波機等之用。另外一個是蓄電池室，專供有綫調整室載波機所需一百三十伏脫直流電之甚，每天由技術員佐留意該室之乾燥及氣溫，及電液量之調配等工作。</p>
<p>但假使外來的電力突然停電的話，迄對於中央室不免是致命傷，所以中央室屬下還有一支「後備車」存在著，這便是備用的油機發電機室，是用柴油引擎發電的。如一且當力公司斷電，我們自己也可以供給三百八十伏脫的交流電，平日也時時作演習性的開動，以免臨時抱佛脚。</p>
<p>總之，中央室所屬旣然都是機務人員，所以他們的工作雖不若別部人員有條理，然而他們有的勞心，有的勞力，有的要設計一個巨大的工程，有的要爬上爬下終日與油污的機器，航　的電用爲伍，埋頭苦幹，却永遠做的是「後台英雄」。不要說如果一一旦缺少了它——央室就是偶而惠一次心戲衰弱，全上海整個的電報通訊，真要堪設想了。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>閒話葡萄</h3>
<p>— 曙風</p>
<p>葡萄的移植到中國，遠在公元前二世紀的時期。漢書上記載說：「大宛國治貴山城左右以葡萄爲酒，富人藏酒至萬餘石，久者至數十歲不敗。張賽始爲武帝會之－采蒲陶目宿種　，天子益種蒲陶，離宮館旁極望焉。」便是一個明證，而且，葡萄剛一僑居過來，就被種植得以致「極望」，可見當時人對這種硃紅圓潤的葡萄的愛好一般。魏文帝還有過稱頌葡萄爲「甘而不飴，脆而不酸，冷而不寒，味長汁多」的句子，傎可說是對這種芳香酷烈，味若醍醐的佳果讚頌備至了。</p>
<p>我國葡萄上的記載，都說葡萄產、西域各地，古西域的大部份，就是現在的中亞細亞一帶。的確在道一帶地方，尤其是在中亞細亞的阿姆河流域（Amu　Daria）附近，葡萄自然地野生看，基至還可能找到大至兩人合抱的株幹，和二尺長，十幾斤的葡萄　子。我國唐書也有記載說：「大食，本波斯地，歲獻貴人葡萄，大者如鷄卵。」農政全書也有：「…雲南者，大如；……波斯國所出，大如鷄卵。」葡萄竟然大如鷄卵，自然他的株幹要兩個人才能合抱得起，比起我們所能見到的那種來自河北，山東一帶的　中型的葡萄，傎不啻是大巫之與小巫，着實差得多了。</p>
<p>葡萄還有一個呌做「賜紫櫻桃」的別名。明徐光啓的農政全書裏說「…葡萄，一名賜紫櫻桃。廣志日：有黃白黑三種；水晶葡萄暈色帶白如着粉，形大而長，味甘；紫葡萄，黑色，有大小兩種，酸甜兩味；綠葡萄，出蜀中；熟時色綠，至若西番之綠葡萄名兎晴，味勝糖蜜，無核，則異品也。」但是除了這些以顏色米分別的名稱外，還有薁蘡，草龍珠，公領孫，玫瑰香，馬乳葡萄等以品質來分的許多別緻的名字。之外，更有一種產在吐書蕃的瑣瑣葡萄，實小如胡椒，正和那鷄蛋型的葡萄，相映成趣，則是葡萄的別種。農政全書也有關於「瑣瑣葡萄」的記載，說：「瑣瑣葡萄，小兒常食，可免生痘，又云痘不快，食之即出。」不意如此的美味佳果，還有這種治病的功効。</p>
<p>至於摘取葡萄來製取乾葡萄的方法，過去在山西一帶的人，慣常先用繩子繫上了一串鮮葡萄，懸掛在一間乾燥而密不通風的房屋裏，再在這間屋子裏，生了地火爐，便得這些鮮葡萄漸漸烘乾；經過約二十幾天的烘焙，便可以取下貯藏起來，大概四斤鮮葡萄，可以烘製出一斤葡萄乾，齊民要術一書裹，也載有一種製取葡萄的方法，說：「極熟者，一一零壓摘取，刀子切去蒂，匆令汁出……煮四五沸，漉出陰乾，便成矣。滋味倍勝，又夏月不敗」。則又是一種水煮的方法。</p>
<p>葡萄雖是原產在中亞細亞，但是歐洲的　產量反而比較亞洲的產量來得多，法國，意大利·葡萄牙·西班牙等國家，都是大量出產葡萄和葡萄酒的國家。單就其中葡萄牙一國來說，種植葡萄的園林，竟占有全國面積的百分之三十五，就是說，單祇葡萄牙一國，能出產葡萄的園地，就已有三萬方公里的土地，相當於三十三個半的上海市。其產量之多便可想而知了。</p>
<h3>深刻的印象</h3>
<p>— 張光裕</p>
<p>十年前，我在資島，曾去參觀敎會辦的聖功女子中學的展覽會。那裏陳列着精緻的衣褲與枕頭，引人口涎的蛋糕細點，以及大字小字繪畫與文卷。當我出了一個陳列室要踏進另一個陳列室的時候，隔壁的房間傳出來鋼琴聲。那時走廊上正坐着一位美國籍的敎師，她聽到琴聲，立刻莊肅地站立起來，一分鐘過後，她又含笑地坐了下去。我想那鋼琴的音調，大約很像美國的國歌，所以她聽到之後，不自覺地肅立起來，待仔細一聽，發現並非國歌的時候，這才含笑地坐下去。這情景，不知別的絡繹不絕的參觀者看到了沒有，感覺如何，但它給了我一個深刻的印像。</p>
<p>也是十年前，也是在靑島，我到中山公園去看櫻花。一株一株看過去，不覺走近所謂「忠魂碑」。那是日本爲紀念他們目德國手中奪取靑島陣時亡的將士建立的。對這地方，我不大發生興趣，所以一向很少來。這回由於櫻花的招惹，我竟然來了，於是也就向它瞥了一眼。我看見「忠魂碑」前只有一個日本裝束的幼重。我稱他幼童，因爲看來他不過五六歲。他也許是幼稚園生，也許還禾讀書，但他獨自在這裏了。他是自己從家跑到這裏來的呢，還是跟隨父母看櫻花抽空到這裘來的呢？我全不知道。我只見他端莊地站立，虔誠地彎下身去。他身邊沒有訓育主任，也沒父母兄弟姊妹，他單獨地在致敬了。這情景，不知別的絡繹不絕的遊人看見了沒有，感覺如何，但它給了我一個深刻的印象。</p>
<h3>建文遜國後略談</h3>
<p>— 朱力行</p>
<p>建文帝南面稱君只有四年，便被擁兵　　的燕王逼迫得遜國而逃，從此這位一代人君，披起袈裟歛跡西南，度其暮鼓晨鐘的生活。</p>
<p>燕王改元登極後，表面上曾一度醫　風行的下令嚴拿緝捕這位遜國逃亡黃帝－建文君，實際上全是一種打草驚蛇的措施，如果傎個將建文帝逮捕到了，反而使燕王對之難以措置，殺？奪人家的政權，曲在自己，有什慶理由去殺，良心上固然說不過去，歷史上也難交代這件公案。留？再沒有第二個大明朝可去安置，一國不容二君，怎麼可以分庭抗禮？根本沒有辦法去留。放？爲什麼要提，捉而後放，何如不提，而且建文帝所有能派用塲的一些勢力，早被斬盡殺絕，剩有少數從亡，又是一批不足與謀的席碌大夫，根本沒有放在眼底，所以姑縱一個憂柔寡斷的建文帝，孤掌難鳴，了無足碍，諒透了建文帝沒有力量再從他手裏把政權奪回去。因此也就不樹倒刨根，反而放寬一着不去窮究，我替建文帝勒一把大汗，燕王當時如果不是這樣打算的話，再也逃不出他的魔堂。</p>
<p>朝庭旣不固求水落石出，有司又何必落井而下白，而况這件事公道有在，何必要在歷史上多補一筆「年月日某某捕得舊君建文帝獻於朝」呢。所以建文帝能可以從容來往西南三十九個年頭的，未嘗不是這幾種原因而得逍遙一生的。</p>
<p>建文帝二十九年　泊生活中·進歷了不少名山勝跡，又因爲雅愛吟　，所以登高每有所賦，請看以下所題的，登峨嵋有詩云：「登高不待東翹首，但見雲從故國飛。」登章　吊古詩有云：「楚歌趙舞今何在？惟見寒鴉繞樹啼。」又感懷詩云：「牢落西南四十秋，蕭蕭白髮已盈頭，乾坤有限家何在？江漢無情水自流。長藥宮中　氣散，朝元閣上雨聲收。新蒲細柳年年緣，野老吞聲哭未休！」又散題在各處的其一：「風旗一夕忽雨侵，天命潛移四海心，鳳返丹山紅日遠，龍歸滄海碧雲深。紫徽有象星還供，玉漏無聲水自沉。遙想禁城今夜月，六宮猶望華臨。」其二：「閱罷楞嚴磐賴敲，笑看黃屋寄團瓢，南來瘴嶺千層廻，北望天門萬里遙。款段久忘飛鳳　，袈裟新換袞龍袍。百官此日知何處，唯有羣島早晚朝」。傎是悲慨惻絕，能不呌人一讀三嘆！一代人君！一代詩人！</p>
<h3>留學的價值</h3>
<p>— 何以聽</p>
<p>國慶前夕，假淸華同學會歡送一位友人赴美留學，席間許多熟悉的朋友，討論到了留學的價値問題，有提起留學浪費論調的，有對留學表示惋惜的，大家引起了許多的感慨！</p>
<p>關於反對留學的理由，大致有兩種說法：第一種是胡適之先生說的「浪費外匯」，這是他從經濟立塲上說的意見，但留學價値是多方面的，增長個人見開，發揚民族風氣，溝通國際文化，促進世界合作，不能單憑一個經濟的理由而因噎廢食。</p>
<p>第二種理由，較易使人置信，說是留學結果，多半和國內現實社會脫節。因此自淸末派遺留學生以來，毫無成績可言。其實社會的不能改良，這是整個國家的問題，不能完全歸咎於留學生。留學生自暴自棄的也有，如淸末的一批洋大人，和各機關貪汚的職員，但這些都不能影響到留學本身的價値，留學等於辦大學，大學裏儘管有許多敗類和不景氣的現象，但我們並不因此廢止大學了。平心而論，留學生爲國效勞的確也不少，今日負起國家建設方面的責任，多半還是留學的人材。國民革命追隨國父的領導者，留學生是全部的主力，淸代派遣留學，却收得了意外的效果，這也可以作爲留學價値多方面的一個明證。</p>
<p>從敎育本身立塲來說：留學政策只是一種手段，用來達到「學術自立」的月的，採取人家的優點，充實自己的能力，也不失我國「見賢思齊」的精神。雖然聘請幾位外國學者來華講學，一樣也可發展效果，但學術的硏究，不單是口頭傳授而已，還有硏學風氣和社會背景的種種條件，可不是一蹴而就的事情。再把眼光放得遠點，漢唐時代，東西各國就有留學生派遣來華，今年歐洲各國，也有與我國大學交換學生之舉，一國有一國的文化特長，學術的交流，還存在着道義上的責任。我國悠久的道德精神，正爲現代人類和平所需要，那時世界學生紛紛來華留學，我們也不能把　入外匯作爲硏究的月標啊。所以，主要的問題是如何把留學政策趕快改善起來？諸如提高留學生出國水準，補導留學生硏究工作，便利留學生回國服務，儘量使留學生發展抱負，這才是今天値得提出來討論，而聘請政府迅速予以實施的工作。</p>
<p>世界的文化是一世紀一世紀地融合着，在今日國際關係尚未脫離仇視的狀態下，派遣留學生有着他更積極的意義，我們爲着整個世界的文化，和人類的和平，應該多多遣派留學生！</p>
<p>啓：中日通郵早經恢復，茲經郵局來函，用爲勘正。</p>
<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐寂團</p>
<p>美國小姐的跳舞訓練</p>
<p>美國人並不把跳舞作爲一種娛樂，而把牠當作一種禮節和健身方式，因爲在美國根本沒有職業舞堪和以跳交際舞爲職業的女子，所以在歐美各國，跳舞並不是奢侈浮華的行爲，而是正當的動作，這是仁者見仁，智者見智的說法，如果給一個存心不良的人來解釋，他可以把社會上一切的罪惡歸到舞女的身上。其實舞女是中國畸形社會的必然產物，倘如中國朝野提倡跳舞，無諭男女老少都能跳上一只，那末跳舞的神秘性和舞女的吸引力自然消失了，誰還會被陶醉呢？</p>
<p>美國女性自幼就進跳舞學校練習步伐，並不是預備將來下海伴舞爲噉飯工具的，而是鍛鍊體格，曲綫美，大腿天。美國女子的美在那裏，在大腿，在曲綫，道種美並不是與生俱來的，而是鍛鍊出來的，不下苦功是決不會有健美的體格。東方女性不講求健美，小脚派，林黛玉派，是中國女性的代表人物，近年跳舞風行，女子有了發育的機會，但總趕不上美國小姐那們骨肉停匀。</p>
<p>美國的跳舞學校，規模均極宏大，敎法嚴格，決不含有胡調性質，豆腐作風，每小時收發美金四元，半小時起算，敎一次算一次，按時間十足計算，敎學極爲認傎，學校有廣大舞池，四面大幅玻璃鏡，對鏡舉步，藉以糾正姿勢，除交際舞外，另有特別班敎授舞台表演舞，此種舞藝須下苦功四五年方可望成功，其要點在足尖與腰及腿，每日勤練三四小時，經四五年光陰，自然身輕如燕，盡態極妍，然後可以登台表演。舞蹈是搆成美國女性日常生活的一部分，不懂舞蹈便不成其爲現代女性，大學裏文學院專設有舞蹈科，修業期滿，授以舞蹈學士碩士，甚至博士學位，學術界對於跳舞一道何等重視，這種藝術一到了中國，便被人利用作貿利工具，因而引起頑固份子的抗議，要禁絕跳舞，（或者是禁絕營業性的舞塲），這是因　噎廢食的辦法，要防止跳舞被人利用來貿利，惟一的好辦法是提倡跳舞，使跳舞民衆化，經濟化，使舞塲沒有生意，舞女沒有主顧，你想，大家可以帶女友到公園裏去跳舞，誰還願意跑進舞塲呢？</p>
<p>影壇一週</p>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<h3>庸俗的改編作「春殘夢斷」</h3>
<p>根據了屠格湼失的「貴族之家」所改編的「春殘夢斷」，顯然不能與原著同日而語，因爲現在所被改編成的故事，旣庸俗而又失掉了人們的同情，作爲一個悲劇，那末劇中的主角就缺少了高貴的情操，女主角李麗莎祇憑了兒時的一點感情，她的愛戀咸壯猶是盲目的，像故事中那樣缺乏基礎而又無共同現想的愛情，僅是少年男女熱情衝動下的泡沫，咸壯猶這個人物，更是自私殘忍，一無可愛，而劇作者偏要編製成這件戀愛悲劇，他的企圖是要賺取觀衆的眼淚，但劇作者對於構成一個悲劇的社會原因，却根本就沒有理解，因此只能寫成像現在這樣一個浮淺的故事。</p>
<p>由於劇本的內容決定了演出的形式，導演者只是支離破碎的掇成了一部所謂悲劇的影片，而演員中劉瓊是最糟的一個，他永遠是那副工架。李　華演得較爲差强人意，沈揚的音樂家生硬而不自然，于令的老祖母頗佳。喬奇的洪家琪是全局由最佳的一個演員。</p>
<h3>一無可取的「假而女郞」</h3>
<p>「假面女郞」又是部從外國作品中改編過來的作品，這故事就是巴爾扎克的「僞裝的愛情」，可是我們的劇作者不管這故事是否適合於我們的國情，祇憑了離奇曲折的情節，就把它搬到了我們的土地上，結果一切變成了劇作者虛構的故事，遠離了現實，兩那個荒唐的男主角范亞倫，被寫成了一個抗戰英雄，那更是不倫不類。總之，這是部弄噱頭而一無可取的片子。</p>
<p>方沛霖的導演手法，僅僅只能做到搬羿故事，平舖直叙，同時也漏洞百出。演員中，顧蘭君極爲賣力，但並無精彩，嚴化這次並不過火，確較佳於以往。</p>
<h3>拼凑成的故事「苦戀」</h3>
<p>「大中華」的片子在國產片由是水進較低的，這部「苦　」也沒有例外，故事本身就是七拼八凑而成的，女主角眉眉與呂莎的私奔，本身就是一件荒唐的行爲，他們的下一代海燕與呂學誠的戀愛，那也不過是抄襲「雷雨」中的舊故事。總之，這個劇本是由西片與舞台劇中抄襲而來，一個拙劣的「拼盤」。</p>
<p>演出上，翼秋霞頗能抓住人物性格，穩健老練，陳娟娟也能稱職，呂玉堃的二個角色，均無較好成績。</p>
<p>此片導演，十足「香港作風」馬馬虎虎。</p>
<h3>風趣的幻想片「太虛幻境」</h3>
<p>英國人有着一貫的幽默與風趣，這部「太虛幻境」，就是描寫人間與犬堂的影片，而作者巧妙的運用了一個空軍因腦受傷而發生的幻覺，故事在二面同時發展，編得也緊湊而有趣。攝製上「人問」用五彩，「天堂」用單純的灰色，極爲合適，確是頗具匠心。</p>

<h3>The Northeastern National Army Gains the Initiative: Kaiyuan Relieved, Zhonggu Recaptured, and the Beining Railway Line's Shenyang-Jinzhou Section Restored to Traffic</h3>
<p>[Our Panyang Correspondent, 13th] The Northeast Communist bandits' sixth offensive is now nearing the end of its initial phase, with the next development being the main battle of the sixth offensive. In the past 24 hours, good news has poured in from the National Army. Zhou Fucheng's troops in Xin Kaiyuan have been relieved. Yingkou has been saved, Xinmin has become secure, and after the recovery of Heishan City, near Dahushan, the Shenyang-Jinzhou section of the Beining Railway Line was restored to traffic on the 13th. Reinforcements are continuously arriving from inside the pass, and Fu Zuoyi's cavalry division has already reached its designated location. Furthermore, Han Communist Li Hongguang's detachment of over 2,000 men attacked the Nan Zamu Railway Station northeast of Fushun on the night of the 12th. After four hours of fierce fighting, they were finally repelled, and the entire eastern front is now peaceful. Also, in the battle of Heishan on the 12th, Liu Shugang, the commander of the bandit's 20th Division, was captured.</p>
<p>[Our Panyang Correspondent, 13th] On the 13th, the National Army launched an attack from Tieling, crossed Pingdingbao, recaptured Zhonggu, and advanced towards Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Correspondent, 13th] The situation in the Northeast war is becoming increasingly clear. The government and various parties believe that this so-called sixth offensive by the Communist bandits is actually their last. From the National Army's perspective, reinforcements are now being continuously deployed from inside the pass, and the situation has shifted from passive to active.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 13th] Chen Cheng, in his memorial week address at the headquarters, stated regarding the war situation: The situation in the Northeast war is now stable, and the National Army has gained the initiative. In the past two weeks, due to the rapid offensive of the bandits and inadequate defenses, the National Army in western Liaoning suffered slight losses. The National Army achieved brilliant victories on the outskirts of Kaiyuan and Tieling. Currently, there are only minor battles on various fronts. Chen also expressed great satisfaction with the stability of public morale.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] Zhao Jia visited Changchun and Siping yesterday to inspect the situation and met with the commanders of the garrison in Changchun, the mayor, and Liang Huasheng, the chairman of Jilin Province. He then flew back to Shenyang on the same day. According to Zhao, the National Army can soon join forces between Tieling and Kaiyuan, and the war situation has entered a stable phase.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] The situation in the southern section of the Changchun-Shenyang area is gradually moving from stability towards clarity. The National Army brigades continuing north from Shenyang, and the main force of the bandit army, which has been depleted through repeated battles, have been engaged in a full-scale battle on the border between the two Liaoning provinces for over a week. Since the 12th, after the National Army launched proactive attacks from the three strongholds of Siping, Kaiyuan, and Tieling, the great battle north of Shenyang has entered a decisive stage. If the main force of the hundreds of thousands of bandit troops does not manage to flee in the next few days, they will inevitably face a fate even more惨 than the Siping campaign in May of this year.</p>
<h3>Liao Yaoxiang's Interview with Reporters: The Communist Bandits' Plan Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>[Our Panyang Correspondent, 13th] General Liao Yaoxiang is overseeing the war on both the northern and southern fronts, traveling back and forth. On the 13th, a reporter encountered him somewhere. According to his account: Although the current war situation does not allow for excessive optimism, it has indeed become stable. The Communist bandits' sixth offensive came with great force. Their plan was to completely destroy the Beining Railway, cut off the important supply lines between inside and outside the pass, then occupy Xinmin, take Tieling, capture Yingkou, and seize Dahushan, completing the entire encirclement of Shenyang, the heart of the Northeast. Currently, the entire Northeast Field Communist bandit force has been mobilized, and it has now reached the stage where the opening battle of the "sixth offensive" is coming to an end. In the initial phase, the National Army has shattered the bandits' plan. Not only have the bandits gained little, but they have also suffered major blows in Tieling and Xinmin. They are now considering their remaining resources and are hesitating between Kaiyuan, Tieling, and other fronts. The bandit's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns attacked Kaiyuan and Tieling, the 2nd column attacked Siping, the 7th column attacked Xinmin and Dahushan, the 8th column attacked Yingkou, the 11th column attacked Fushun, and the 5th, 9th, and 10th columns were also mobilized. The use of such a large force in the initial phase of the "sixth offensive," especially the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns, which the bandits consider elite troops, has led to such an outcome that the bandits cannot help but worry about their remaining resources. Although there will be many difficulties ahead, the National Army's strength is increasing, and we will ultimately achieve final victory.</p>

<h3>Improving the Treatment of Public Education Personnel; Index-Based Salary Payment Is Difficult; Supervisory Committee Insists on the Original Proposal; Executive Yuan Discusses at Today's Routine Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The Executive Yuan will submit the issue of improving the treatment of public education personnel for discussion at the routine meeting on the morning of the 14th. Although the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Political Consultative Council advocate paying salaries based on the cost of living index, the Executive Yuan still believes that there are many difficulties. The reporter visited a certain director of the finance department today, who said: The competent authority has conducted a calculation based on the proposals submitted by the various branches. If estimated according to the current 30,000 times the original salary, the increased treatment for civil servants nationwide will increase the national treasury's monthly expenditure by 3 trillion to 4 trillion, so the national treasury is afraid that it will not be able to bear it. Moreover, based on the actual situation, the fastest cost of living index for various regions will be reported to Beijing around the 5th of next month, and after being reviewed and approved and sent back to various regions, the fastest will also be around the 25th of next month. If so, then the salary must be delayed until the next month, which is technically very difficult.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, the Supervisory Yuan held a meeting of supervisory committee members. The committee members present unanimously stated that the plan to jointly adjust the treatment of public education personnel according to the cost of living index, as decided by the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the National Political Consultative Council earlier this month, is the minimum requirement to maintain the livelihood of public education personnel. However, it has recently been reported that the Executive Yuan will still maintain the method of adjustment based on a multiplier, which they believe is unreasonable and will be discussed again with the Legislative Yuan and the National Political Consultative Council to take a consistent attitude.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Commodity prices in various places are rising sharply, and the lives of ordinary people have become difficult, especially for public education personnel. The Capital's All-Circles National Salvation General Mobilization Committee recently telegraphed the Chairman, strictly ordering the administrative authorities to adjust the treatment of public education personnel based on the actual situation, strengthen price controls, and encourage the development of industry and commerce, so that the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation can be smoothly completed.</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Reports on His Inspection Impressions at the Memorial Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Kuomintang Central Committee's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week was held at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 13th in the auditorium of the department. After Chairman Sun Ke led the ceremony, Zhang Qun, the director of the Executive Yuan, reported on his impressions of his recent inspection of the Northeast and North China. He briefly stated that before the September 18th Incident, he had worked in the Northeast for several months, and after the September 18th Incident, he had also gone to North China from time to time. Contrasting his memories with his recent experiences, both the Northeast and North China have made progress. The areas inspected during this trip had previously been occupied by Japan, and the current environment is still harsh. The people have deep impressions of the cruelty of Japan and the Communist bandits, whether they have witnessed it or experienced it themselves. The people of the Northeast and North China hate and fear the Communist bandits. Therefore, the closer the Communist bandits' propaganda is to the bandit areas, the less effective it is, and the closer the government's mobilization efforts to suppress the rebellion are to the bandit areas, the more successful they are.</p>
<h3>All Seven Counties in the Altay District of Xinjiang Recaptured; Rebel Leader Flees to Tacheng</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 13th] Talihan Ajikhasak Wen, who had just come to Dihua from Chenghua, told reporters at noon on the 13th that all seven counties in the Altay region have indeed been recaptured. The rebel leader Darier Khan fled to Tacheng, and his family fled to the Soviet Union. The biggest reason for the rapid collapse of the rebels was the opposition of the people, not Osman's selection of attacks. 　 Talihan is the second son of Finance Director Maikikhan.</p>
<h3>Xu Siping Talks About Military Service, Treats People with Sincerity</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] Military News Agency Dispatch: Currently, the entire military service administration is not well understood by outsiders, that is, why conscription continues after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Xu Siping, the director of the Military Service Bureau, specifically told reporters: "Conscription is a way to build the country, build the army, and defend ourselves. It is not because of the current suppression of bandits and rebellion that conscription is necessary. In any country in the world, there must be preparations in peacetime to protect the national defense. If there is no conscription, once something happens, there will be no preparations. Therefore, the current conscription is purely based on this major premise. The current suppression of bandits is actually a necessary path for the country to move towards unification. The people have the obligation to perform military service, which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution, and the Military Service Law is formulated based on the Constitution and approved by the highest authorities, so there will be no bias and no unfairness. Moreover, those who are conscripted are given many preferential treatments, and attention is paid to the implementation of military service and improvements are made at any time. Due to the fact that the implementation of the conscription system in large cities seems to be difficult, voluntary soldiers are recruited. If there is a shortfall, 　 will still be drawn. Although there are still some difficulties in implementing the military service administration at present, we hope that the news media will provide more assistance. The Military Service Bureau will definitely treat the people with sincerity, and all difficulties can be resolved."</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Bullitt's Proposal: In Line with Truman's Policy; Currency Value Can Be Stabilized If Loan Is Successful</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] A reporter visited Dr. Wang 　 Hui, an authority on diplomacy, on the 13th to inquire about his opinions on Bullitt's proposal. He said that Bullitt has been an envoy to various countries and has a very deep understanding of the international situation. His article on the proposal to aid China is practical and pertinent. Not only does China welcome it, but all those who want to see the realization of world peace also feel deeply gratified. 　 Bullitt's article is actually in line with President Truman's policy of aiding Europe. The purpose of Bullitt's article is to call the attention of the U.S. government and people to the situation in Asia and urge their government to adopt a reasonable and effective Far East policy in order to avoid the drawbacks of 　 Ku. Wang believes that the revival of the Communist International is mainly a propaganda offensive, but this will inevitably promote the opposition between democracy and totalitarianism, and make the situation increasingly tense. As for what China should do in the increasingly dangerous international situation? Wang said that we do not have to take the country as the object. Since we have always advocated democracy, we will stand on the side of the democratic front in the future and actively strive for the realization of world peace.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] After Bullitt's urgent proposal to assist China 　 was published, both China and the United States 　 Theory paid great attention to it. Yesterday, a reporter visited people in the education field in this city, as well as university presidents Zhang Yi of Fudan University, Cheng Xiaogang 　 of Jiaotong University, Zhu Jingnong, president of Guanghua University, and Li 　 Yong, president of 　nan University, and asked for their opinions on the matter. President Zhang Yi said that Bullitt's view of China is extremely correct and far-sighted. If the U.S. loan to us is successful, commodity prices can be stabilized, the currency value can be fixed, and domestic order can be restored to a normal state. Zhang pointed out that in the period from the Yalta Secret Agreement to Marshall's visit to China, no one was fairer and more insightful about China than Bullitt. President Cheng Xiaogang said that Chinese people must strive for progress, self-reliance, and then, in addition to the United States, other countries will also be willing to help China. He believes that the United States 　　　　　　　　　　　　. Regardless of whether its loan is successful or not, its focus is on the United States itself. President Zhu Jingnong said: U.S. loan is extremely important to China's construction. My country's university education, equipment, and teachers are all deficient. If the U.S. loan is successful, I can order a large number of instruments from abroad, and 　 international first-class professors to China to teach, hoping that friendly countries will help us build, but not accept foreign interference in my country. Bullitt's 　　 can change the views of some Americans on me. President Li Shouyong said that the Chinese question, directly and indirectly, can affect the safety of the world, we not only hope that the United States will lend me 1.35 billion yuan, but also hope that there will be greater assistance.

<h3>Stimulating Factors in the Wild Price Surge</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of October, prices have been soaring continuously. Recently, the surge has become increasingly wild, with different prices in the morning and evening markets. People are truly breathless in this wild price surge. The central government is concerned about the prices in Shanghai and recently sent Liu Zhendong, Huang Yuanbin, Shi Kuiling, and others from the National Economic Commission to Shanghai for investigation. However, what welcomed Liu and his party to Shanghai was not a slight reduction in the habitual price surge, but rather a continued wild increase in prices. Liu and his party have been in Shanghai for several days, and we have not seen them issue any statements in the newspapers, presumably because they are devoted to investigation and research, and do not indulge in empty talk. This spirit is quite commendable. Frankly speaking, in the past, price increases were often stimulated by casual remarks and haphazard planning by important figures. Therefore, the silence of Liu and his party is at least not a factor in stimulating prices.</p>
<p>The fact that prices have been rising in the past few days is a reality that every Shanghai citizen has personally experienced. The consequences of this wild surge not only pose a serious threat to people's livelihoods and general industry and commerce, but also are sufficient to affect social order. From whatever aspect one considers, the government must make every effort to stop this wild surge. If there is no method and it is allowed to take its natural course, or if there is a method but the government is hesitant, then the government is incompetent.</p>
<p>The wild price surge has broken past records in the past few days. Taking rice as an example, at the beginning of this month, the price of rice in the city was still around 570,000 yuan per picul. It then gradually increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, the retail price of rice tended to rise above 800,000 yuan, an increase of about 50% within ten days! During the same period, general prices have also seen a surge, with the wild increase in the market prices of cooking oil and cloth being particularly astonishing. Within these ten days, it is not difficult for us to see some traces of the wild price surge. Tracing back this October price surge, we must start from the increase in the exchange rate of the US dollar from September 30th. The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee increased the market price of the US dollar by 3,500 yuan that day, from 46,000 yuan to 49,500 yuan. Subsequently, we saw the market price of cooking oil soaring, rising by 100,000 yuan at the same time. The negotiated price of flour also increased by 180,000 yuan, and it was decided that the negotiated price of flour would be adjusted flexibly in the future. However, the price of rice at that time was still around 570,000 yuan. On October 4th, cotton cloth rose sharply, and the price of yarn was also adjusted, increasing by 700,000 yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. The next day, the price of yarn continued to rise wildly, increasing uniformly for both coarse and fine yarns, from over 800,000 to over 1 million yuan, while the price of rice remained unchanged. On the 6th, the price of rice finally rose by 30,000 yuan due to the increase in the price of yarn, cooking oil, and other commodities. At the same time, the forward exchange rate increased by 8%, and the yarn market became more chaotic. According to reports, the wholesale price index rose from 67.568 to 74.367 between September 29th and June 4th. On the 9th, the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee increased the market price of the US dollar to 55,300 yuan, and the price of rice jumped by 100,000 yuan, from around 570,000 yuan to around 670,000 yuan. Recently, prices have become increasingly crazy, with the price of rice almost exceeding 800,000 yuan. Under such a wild surge, people's livelihoods are deteriorating, and the majority of legitimate industries and businesses are also in imminent danger, except for a few who are speculating for profit!</p>
<p>From the price fluctuations in the past ten days, it is not difficult to see the relationship between the exchange rate and price changes. When the exchange rate rises, prices follow; and when prices rise, it also affects the rise in the exchange rate. This is already a vicious cycle, not to mention the black market exchange rate and psychological factors involved. If the rising trend of the black market exchange rate can be curbed, then the price surge may be slightly reduced. Indeed, there was a short period in the past ten days when prices tended to fall back. Because most people thought that the rise in the black market exchange rate was just a craze, they wanted it to return to calmness, and they focused their attention on whether the market price of the exchange rate would rise. On October 8th, when the black market for foreign exchange and gold notes was already fluctuating wildly, a person in charge of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee told reporters: "The adjustment of the market price of foreign exchange will never follow the black market." However, as soon as this statement was made, the next day we saw the Equilibrium Committee increase the market price of the US dollar by 5,800 yuan, changing it to 55,300 yuan. The second day happened to be Double Ten National Day. Although there was no public market price, people were already feeling uneasy. As a result of this evolution, it finally evolved into today's wild surge.</p>
<p>Prices and foreign exchange rates are already mutually causal, forming a vicious cycle. Looking at the course of this wild price surge this month, we cannot but say that it has been harmed by the drastic changes in the exchange rate. The fact that the Equilibrium Committee has changed the exchange rate twice within ten days cannot but have a significant impact on the psychology of the general public. In particular, the person in charge of the committee said that the market price of foreign exchange would never follow the black market, but the exchange rate has already fluctuated. Regardless of whether the Equilibrium Committee has its own sufficient reasons, insisting that the change in the exchange rate is not following the black market, in fact, the general public will inevitably regard it as following the black market! If the method of following the black market is used to eliminate the black market for a long time, then the market price of foreign exchange is no different from a dog chasing an electric rabbit in a dog racing track! Anyone can manage foreign exchange this way, but who will be responsible for stimulating prices?</p>
<p>In recent years, the general public has been deeply troubled by price fluctuations, and they all hope that prices will stabilize one day. At this time, the measures of the government authorities should especially grasp the hearts of the people, and must not specialize in empty talk and high-sounding rhetoric in theory, while in practical actions, they often disappoint the general public. Most importantly, those in charge of management must make big plans and set big strategies without any consideration of personal interests, and must be extremely confidential and not leak any information in advance. Otherwise, those who are good at catching shadows will often take advantage of the opportunity for profit, and further stimulate the price increase. A few people get rich, but the vast majority of the masses suffer!</p>

<h3>Reactions to Bullitt's Proposal</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Since Bullitt's urgent aid to China proposal was published, reactions among foreigners in the city have varied depending on their own standpoint. Generally, they can be summarized into two types, which are discussed as follows: Some believe that Bullitt is a prominent figure in American politics, and his aid to China proposal will inevitably attract the attention of the White House and the State Department. As for whether Bullitt's proposed method of aid to China is feasible, that is another question. It is particularly surprising that the estimated amount of US dollars needed is so precise. Others believe that two points in Bullitt's proposal are difficult to realize. In terms of loans, the Marshall Plan to aid Europe has been hindered, and the funds needed to revive southern Korea have also been reduced due to opposition from Congress. Therefore, at least for the time being, China's hope of obtaining loans is not great. In terms of sending MacArthur to China as an advisor, MacArthur is indeed a talented general, but he may not be suitable for this type of political work. As for Bullitt himself, he has many friends in the diplomatic community, but his reputation in the United States is not very high. He ran for mayor of Philadelphia last year and was defeated, which can serve as proof. Therefore, the actual impact of his proposal is still difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Poland's Economic System: Focusing on Developing the Sugar Industry "Travels in Poland," Letter 6 (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>Cooperative enterprises have now become a rather important part of Poland's economic system. The Communist Party's socio-economic policies divide all enterprises into three types: state-owned, cooperative, and private. According to the "Nationalization of Enterprises" Act promulgated on January 3, 1946, privately operated factories are limited to no more than fifty workers. In other words, all factories with more than fifty workers are to be taken over by the state or operated by cooperatives. The total number of cooperatives in Poland has not been precisely counted, but the estimated number of cooperative members is approximately over three million. I did not have time to go to the city of "Lodz," which is the industrial center of Poland. According to recent population statistics, Lodz has a population of nearly one million, even greater than the capital of Warsaw. (Warsaw, before the war, once had a population of two million, but now only has 300,000.) In Lodz, the more substantial factories have been taken over by the state from private hands. The government has already paid compensation to the factory owners for many of them, and the funds for compensating certain factories will only be included in the state budget for next year or the year after. My Polish friends told me that the issue of nationalizing enterprises is now often the subject of debate in Parliament. The opposition Polish Peasants' Party of Mikolajczyk firmly advocates maintaining a system of free competition for small businesses. The International Propaganda Office originally wanted to send a special car to take me to Wroclaw to visit the largest state-owned textile factory, but I cancelled the appointment at the last minute due to some matters. The next day, they sent someone to accompany me to visit the Wittels Chocolate Factory across the Cao Sha River, which was one of the factories taken over by the government from private hands after Poland's liberation.</p>
<p>I am extremely impressed by the spirit of the Polish Communist Party in industrial construction. Take the Wittels Sugar Factory, for example: 1,200 employees are able to work diligently and happily. Especially the workers'</p>
<p>Welfare Facilities</p>
<p>Nurseries, employee hospitals, and entertainment venues, although not as lavish as those at the Ford factory in the United States, are clean and tidy. Everywhere you look, you can see that the person in charge has put their heart and soul into truly treating it as something important.</p>
<p>The director of the Wittels factory, Mr. Szulzyński, is an amiable and sincere middle-aged man. A long time ago, he graduated from the Department of Chemical Engineering at Vilnius University. Sugar production was not originally his specialty, but because he studied chemical engineering, many "thresholds" were not difficult to understand after studying them. He showed me many photos, which showed the damage to the sugar factory when Warsaw was first liberated. "Although it is said that the government took over private enterprises, this situation was almost entirely a new beginning!"</p>
<p>He said: All the workers in the factory are members of the Polish Workers' Food Industry Union. The workers adopt a "hourly wage system," working an average of forty-six hours per week. The hourly wage is between thirty-seven and sixty zlotys, depending on the worker's skill. Workers donate one percent of their monthly income to pay union dues. The salaries of employees are paid monthly, ranging from 15,000 zlotys to 90,000 zlotys. Employees and workers can enjoy welfare facilities such as nurseries and hospitals. In addition, there is an internal "social insurance" system within the factory to protect workers from accidents and misfortunes.</p>
<p>He said: Last year's production volume was 2,047 tons, including chocolate, biscuits, and sugar. Among the 1,200 workers, 750 are male and 450 are female. The most wonderful thing is: after the factory was</p>
<p>Nationalized</p>
<p>The original old Lan, who was the general manager, is now still working in the factory as a worker. Szulzyński said: "The original old Lan was a Polish capitalist. Although he did not receive higher education, he is an expert in sugar production. He has experience, so after the government took over, we still let him work in the factory."</p>
<p>Now, the Wittels factory is directly under the Polish Ministry of Food, because sweets are one of the necessary foods for Westerners. All factory production is directed by the Ministry of Food, and the amount of workers' wages is decided by the Ministry of Food in consultation with the union. I asked the director: Have there ever been any strike incidents in the Wittels factory? He shook his head. Up and down, I wandered around the factory for a long time and saw many machines that an "outsider" could not understand. I knew that half of those machines were made in England and half were made in Germany. The main raw material for chocolate, "cocoa," is shipped from the "Gold Coast" of Africa. The paper for wrapping sugar is supplied periodically by the Paper Industry Association.</p>
<p>The guild and union systems connect the entire industry, which is no different in capitalist and communist countries. Poland established the "Central Design Bureau" in October 1945, and at the beginning of this year, it announced a "Three-Year Economic Construction Plan." The content of this plan focuses on the coordination of industry and transportation, especially the connection between industries. More broadly, the</p>
<p>Iron Curtain Behind</p>
<p>Industrial connections between countries are gradually being strengthened. In the Wittels Sugar Factory, I saw them preparing to send treasures to exhibitions in Czechoslovakia and Sweden. Before bidding farewell, Director Szulzyński also told me a story. He said: U.S. Republican presidential candidate Stassen, when visiting Warsaw, also visited the Wittels Sugar Factory accompanied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The former U.S. Ambassador to Poland, Bliss Lane, was also present. Stassen, in order to see the actual lives of the workers, specifically dined with the workers in the large restaurant. "Of course, the workers in our poor country only eat coarse food and simple meals, but that Mr. Stassen was eating with relish. But it was Ambassador Bliss Lane who suffered, sitting on pins and needles, unable to eat. Stassen repeatedly said to the Ambassador silently: 'Eat, such a delicious lunch!'"</p>
<p>The Polish people still resent that former U.S. Ambassador, and some Polish intellectuals say that he was the most diplomatically ignorant diplomat in international friendship, and some even scold him as the biggest enemy of Poland. A reporter from a Polish left-wing newspaper told me: "Bliss Lane has recently been writing articles in American magazines, scolding Poland!" I saw that he was very angry when he spoke. I said: It's a pity that I didn't see that magazine, I would really like to see how he scolds. (Continued from yesterday's third page)</p>

<h3>European Countries Request for Aid Amounts: US Insists on Reductions: Advocates Reopening the Sixteen-Nation Conference to Revise the Report: European Aid Plan Enters Political Phase</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Authoritative sources say: When the U.S. government begins meetings with European Sixteen Nations Economic Cooperation Committee Chairman Franks and other members, it will investigate the possibility of reopening the Sixteen Nations Conference so that, before submitting the U.S. government's aid plan to Congress, the European countries can agree to inevitable revisions of the original Paris Conference report. European diplomatic circles here do not feel enthusiastically about this suggestion, but authoritative U.S. sources say: If European countries are unwilling to reconvene the conference, then the U.S. government can only: 1. submit the original report of the Paris Conference together with the U.S. government's criticisms and recommendations to Congress; or 2. only agree on revision methods with the delegation led by Franks without submitting it to the sixteen countries for a unified vote, which will inevitably cause criticism from individual countries within the sixteen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] The Marshall Plan will enter the political stage here on the 13th. Based on current indications, U.S. officials believe that the report of the sixteen-nation Paris Conference needs to be extensively revised. After U.S. officials met with European technical experts last week, U.S. officials believe that the plan overemphasizes certain sectors. They believe that the report, which calculates the four-year needs of Europe based on the technology of production capacity, is unrealistic and overestimates the needs of the United States. Several members of Congress who have just returned from Europe believe that the Marshall Plan must be implemented. Some of these members of Congress may hold meetings with political problem experts this week to discuss revising figures and changing timelines. U.S. officials are scheduled to meet with European experts again on the 13th. Participants will include European Economic Cooperation Committee Chairman Franks, Acting Secretary of State Lovett, and other senior U.S. diplomats.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The Payment Agreement Committee of the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference on Finance convened in London on September 22 to study the European currency automatic exchange system proposed by the Finance Committee. Its report was published today. The purpose of this system is to promote the development of trade between European countries, so as to exchange a greater quantity of materials than under the current national currency exchange system. Under the automatic exchange system, a country that holds trade-generated deposits in another country can use them to settle trade debts with a third country. This clearing system can minimize payments in gold or convertible currencies.</p>
<h3>Western Europe Should Urgently Help Themselves and Not Solely Rely on U.S. Dollars: U.S. Congressional Delegation to Europe Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 12th] The former U.S. House Special Committee, formed to investigate the needs of various countries for U.S. aid, conducted a six-week investigation in eighteen European countries. Today, the committee's vice chairman, Hand, issued a statement, stating in brief: Our task was already difficult, but it is now made even more difficult by two common misconceptions in Europe: first, that the United States must continue to export in large quantities to prevent economic collapse; second, that Marshall's proposal in fact imposes a responsibility on the United States. Furthermore, the general public, unlike responsible government officials, does not seem to understand that the food and fuel available for export from the United States are limited in number. These misconceptions create an unfounded optimism, sometimes even using it to comfort oneself about the real difficulties at hand. After returning home, we deeply feel that the governments and people of Western European countries must deal with many difficulties, some of which cannot be solved by U.S. dollars alone.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] The special committee of Congress studying the European aid plan returned from its investigation in Europe last weekend. It is learned that the committee will submit a proposal to Congress for a certain degree of aid to Europe, but the amount will not be as large as U.S. officials have requested. The representatives were unable to agree on the urgency and amount of aid to Europe. United Press reporters interviewed four of the six representatives. They believe that France and Italy, under the current situation, can at least maintain until next spring. Another representative said that the two countries should receive aid as quickly as possible. Another representative did not express an opinion on this matter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to U.S. diplomatic officials, the French economic crisis may reach a breaking point within this week. U.S. aid will either be too late or a drop in the bucket. U.S. authorities continued to study at the end of the week whether to provide enough U.S. dollars to France to tide over the difficulties and prevent the country from completely stopping its purchases of wheat fat and coal from the United States before the local elections. However, the hope of this happening is extremely slim. At most, we can only try to maintain a very small number of materials continuing to be imported into France.</p>
<h3>British Deputy Prime Minister Encourages Citizens to Increase Production</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] Deputy Prime Minister Morrison gave a speech tonight, declaring that unless the British people address the export situation in every way and make full use of their spare time to increase production, the United Kingdom will inevitably be defeated in the export battle. Morrison pointed out that the post-war market is different from the pre-war situation. In many ways, the export situation is very unfavorable to Britain, so Britain must maintain the best quality of British goods, otherwise many of the pleasures in the lives of the British people will be eliminated.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Proposes Aiding Europe with Scrapped Ships: Says it Can Save 10 Billion U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Republican Senator Brewster told reporters that he will urge Congress to allocate 20 million tons of wartime-built U.S. ships, now abandoned in various ports, to European countries. He said that this could save the Marshall Plan 10 billion U.S. dollars.</p>
<h3>Briga and Tenda Incorporated into French Territory</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tenda, Italy, 12th] Residents of the Briga and Tenda districts on the French-Italian border held a referendum today. Representatives from Switzerland, Sweden, and the Netherlands were assigned by the International Court of Justice to serve as observers. As a result, the vast majority voted to become part of France. The Italian peace treaty originally stipulated that the two regions should be incorporated into France, but the French constitution prohibits acquiring territory without the consent of the local residents. Both regions have hydroelectric power plants, making them particularly valuable.</p>
<h3>Batavia Consular Corps Passes Final Report Content: Indonesia Plans to Send Goodwill Mission to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 13th] At the meeting of the Consular Committee today, chaired by our Consul General Jiang Jiadong, the content of the committee's final report was passed.

<p>[United Press, Batavia, 13th] The Republic of Indonesia plans to send a goodwill mission to China. Following the visit of Special Envoy Li Tiezheng to Indonesia at the beginning of this year, the Republic planned to send a mission to China.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Suggests Withdrawing Troops from Korea Next Spring: U.S. Government Decides to Reject: Marshall to Send Reply to Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] A spokesman for the U.S. delegation announced today that Secretary of State Marshall will reply to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, stating that the United States has submitted the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly for discussion, and the issue of troop withdrawal will also be proposed and decided upon in the General Assembly. This response is tantamount to rejecting Molotov's suggestion that the U.S. and Soviet troops in Korea withdraw simultaneously next spring.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has issued two notes to the United States, expressing dissatisfaction that the United States has failed to respond to the previous Soviet proposal for troop withdrawal and pointing out that this hinders the resolution of the issue. Marshall has decided to reply with the above opinions. The spokesman for the U.S. delegation also said that the United States may submit a proposal on the troop withdrawal issue to the General Assembly around Friday this week. The content of the proposal will advocate that the withdrawal date be jointly agreed upon by Korea and the United States and the Soviet Union, with the consent of a UN organization. In addition, it will also advocate: 1. Electing a Korean National Assembly. During the election, a UN organization will send an observer team to monitor whether the voting in the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones of Korea is democratic. 2. This National Assembly will elect a provisional unified government and may ask the UN observer team for assistance. This proposal will be presented to the 57-nation Political Committee of the General Assembly by U.S. Representative Dulles and discussed in early next week. Once passed, it will be submitted to the General Assembly for final discussion.</p>

<h3>Peace Conference with Japan: Rumored to be Convened in January Next Year: U.S. State Department Refuses to Comment</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Renowned U.S. radio commentator Pearson, known for his fast-paced reporting of inside news, announced in his weekly broadcast on the evening of the 12th that the long-awaited peace treaty with Japan will be held in Pearl Harbor in January next year. Marshal MacArthur has been internally designated as the chief representative of the United States. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt met with President Truman last week to discuss the time and place for convening the peace conference. Pearson did not reveal more details. The State Department refused to comment on this matter.</p>
<h3>Syrian Military Action: Britain Issues Warning: Egypt Denies Troop Movements</h3>
<p>[United Press, Damascus, 13th] The British Chargé d'Affaires in Syria submitted a note to the Syrian government, stating that the speech made by British Colonial Secretary Jones regarding Britain's withdrawal from Palestine was conditional. At the same time, Britain continues to be responsible for maintaining peace and order. Any action taken by Syria that harms the residents of Babbu will be regarded as detrimental to the British government. After receiving the note, the Syrian government immediately convened a meeting to consider it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 13th] Rumors that Syrian troops have concentrated on the northern border of Palestine, and even tended to send troops to attack the Jewish areas of the Galilee district, have been denied by authoritative sources here.</p>
<p>[United Press, Cairo, 13th] Egyptian Chief of Staff Antella denied on the 13th that any Egyptian troops had moved to the border of Palestine. He also denied the news that he would go to Damascus to discuss military actions to attack Palestine with other Arab leaders.</p>
<h3>Foreign Consulates in Holy City: Bombed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 13th] An explosion suddenly occurred in front of the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem on the 13th. The bomb exploded ten feet from the entrance. Because it was homemade, it was not very powerful, and only a local female employee was injured. Police cars rushed to nearby consulates to prevent further incidents. Before the U.S. Consulate was bombed, the British and Swedish consulates had also been bombed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 12th] The Polish Consulate here was bombed last night, and the iron gate was damaged, but there were no deaths or injuries. This is the second time that foreign consulates in the city have been attacked recently.</p>
<h3>Jewish Terrorists: Plan to Assassinate British Foreign Secretary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 13th] The London Evening Standard reported that Scotland Yard has uncovered a plot to assassinate British Foreign Secretary Bevin. Scotland Yard detectives learned that terrorists (probably Jewish terrorists) had planned to assassinate Bevin. The security protecting Bevin has been notified that the terrorists will definitely attempt to assassinate him. This report could not be confirmed at this time. When reporters asked Bevin about this, Bevin declined to comment, and Scotland Yard also remained silent.</p>
<h3>The United States Opposes Any Nation Seizing Iranian Oilfields by Force; Iran's Foreign Policy Hesitates at a Crossroads</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tehran, 13th Dispatch] Iranian Deputy Prime Minister Khaganu recently announced that Prime Minister Sultana will submit a report on oil negotiations with the Soviet Union to the parliament next week. He stated that during Sultana's tenure, the United States did not negotiate with Iran, nor does it desire Iran's oilfields. The United States will not object to Iran granting oil concessions to any foreign country, but he believes the United States will oppose any attempt to seize Iranian oil lands by military force or coercion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 12th Dispatch] Observers believe that the establishment of the new Comintern by nine European countries has caused Iran's policies, especially regarding the formation of the Soviet-Iranian Oil Company, to become hesitant.</p>
<p>The Iranian parliament has not yet approved the Soviet-Iranian agreement stipulating the establishment of this oil company, and although Prime Minister Sultana has promised to submit a detailed report on this matter to the parliament, various parties still doubt whether the agreement, signed during the Soviet military's presence in Iran, is binding on Iran. The semi-official Ettela'at newspaper advocates for cautious action, while supporters of the Iranian Prime Minister have unanimously criticized the recent actions of the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>The Imminent War Crisis Prompts the United States to Heighten Vigilance</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New Orleans, 13th Dispatch] Senator McMahon, a prominent member of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee of both houses of Congress, stated in a speech here: "The United States will decide next year 'the shape of the world for the next two centuries.' The United States may save Western Europe and Asia, placing them on the mat of freedom, but in the third and final world war, it will lose everything unless it can preemptively control the weapons of mass destruction." McMahon advocated for the implementation of laws prohibiting the export of certain key atomic production machinery and that the United States should consider adopting economic blockades to resist the Soviet Union's Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Hollywood, 13th Dispatch] Vyshinsky, denouncing as war-mongers, American journalist Winchell broadcasted on the 13th, stating: "I wish to awaken America to the dangers abroad." Under Moscow's leadership, the nine-nation Communist Party organization launched a fifth column war against the United States last week. "Communist military spies are mixed among us, waiting for the opportunity to strike. You do not want to enter another war, but the next atomic war is approaching you. All resources in the communist bloc are being used for war. A well-trained Soviet fifth column will seize the governments of European countries. Italy will fall into their hands, keeping the U.S. Navy away from the Soviet Union. France will also fall into their hands, allowing the Soviet Union to attack Britain. If the United States fails to convene a special Congress, it would be a 'grave mistake, endangering the interests of the entire nation.'"</p>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 12th Dispatch] Senator Pepper, speaking at a Slavic American Congress banquet, proposed a world peace plan calling for universal disarmament, with the United States donating $50 billion for world reconstruction. He stated that the world has passed the crossroads of conflict and peace and is heading straight towards universal destruction. Pepper elaborated on his peace plan, stating that his world reconstruction plan should be handled by the United Nations. If all countries agree to immediately disarm to half their strength, the United States could allocate $10 billion annually for world construction over five years. Except for Germany and Japan, all countries should withdraw their occupying forces from various locations, strictly prohibiting any powerful country from interfering in the economy or politics of other countries. All colonies and mandated territories should be placed under the Trusteeship Council, allowing all nations to freely establish their governments without any foreign interference. He stated: "This plan will certainly not bankrupt the United States, as the current U.S. military expenditure reaches $10 billion annually, and the annual aid to foreign countries amounts to $4 billion."</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 12th Dispatch] American Legion President Patterson today called on President Truman and Marshal Stalin to meet as soon as possible to resolve the five major points of international disputes. He stated that the Marshall Plan is an important step in preventing war, but this plan alone is not enough. Therefore, a Truman-Stalin meeting is the only way to resolve the following issues:  Withdrawal of occupying forces by major powers from all locations except Germany and Japan;  U.S.-Soviet agreement on international control of atomic energy;  U.S.-Soviet commercial treaty;  Agreement not to bypass the United Nations, especially regarding arms control;  Establishment of a broad and effective arms control system by the UN General Assembly.</p>
<h3>UN Continues Debate on the Greek Issue; Soviet Union Attacks the US Again; Stance on the Holy Land Issue to be Clarified</h3>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 13th Dispatch] The UN Palestine Special Committee is scheduled to reconvene this afternoon. The seven Arab League countries have completed their final preparations and unanimously oppose any plan to partition the Holy Land. Each delegation plans to deliver successive speeches criticizing the US's position.</p>
<p>According to an Arab spokesperson, anti-American sentiment among most politicians in the Middle East has reached its peak. Meanwhile, the committee secretary announced that applications to speak have now increased to 25 countries. Apart from the Soviet Union's long-awaited statement clarifying its attitude towards the case, France, among the five major powers, will speak last and is expected to support the partition plan at least in principle. The British representative, Colonial Secretary Jones, will respond to the criticisms of the Arab representatives, but will not announce any new policies.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 12th Dispatch] Sources close to the Soviet Union say that the Soviet Union considers the partition of Palestine to be the second-best way to resolve the Holy Land dispute. The Soviet Union will give it conditional support and is expected to tell the UN General Assembly that it secretly supports a single Palestinian federation rather than two divided Arab and Jewish states. However, the source also said that the Soviet Union is prepared to offer conditional support for the approach taken by the United States.</p>

<p>[United Press International, Sydney, 13th Dispatch] Former Australian representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Paul, wrote in the Daily Telegraph on the 13th that after the withdrawal of the American occupation forces, the power of the Japanese Emperor will be greater than it is now. Paul said: "Although Japan has adopted Western democratic forms, there have been no significant changes in the distribution of its economic power, social structure, or political or religious ideas." He said: "This is the result of a long suppression of democratic institutions. They still cannot 'establish the necessary leadership and organization to threaten the position of the old ruling class.'" He issued a warning, fearing the revival of Japanese militarism and that it may rise again in the future to commit aggression. Paul said: "We must ensure that Japan never wants to wage war again, which means that Japan must undergo fundamental policy changes internally in its social, economic, and political systems."</p>

<h3>Deadline for Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Confiscation Upon Discovery of Overdue Items; Municipal Government Resolves to Take Emergency Measures</h3>
<h3>It is Estimated that Non-Industry Individuals are Hoarding Approximately 20,000 to 30,000 Pieces of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) The cotton yarn and cloth market fell into a state of chaos yesterday. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan made a special long-distance call from Nanjing yesterday morning to Mayor Wu, urging him to quickly devise effective measures. Mayor Wu immediately convened a meeting at 4:00 PM with Liu Siying, acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, Wang Qizi, chairman of the six district cotton textile industry associations, and Shu Yuzhang, general manager of the Textile Construction Company, to discuss solutions. After the meeting, Mayor Wu met with reporters and stated that the soaring prices of cotton yarn and cloth were due to speculative hoarding and manipulation. Unless severe punishment is imposed, the prices cannot be suppressed, and other commodity prices will be affected. Since August of this year, the prices of cotton yarn and cloth have increased more than other commodity prices. It has now been decided to implement emergency measures: The Textile Adjustment Committee shall instruct cotton yarn and cloth firms, reprocessing firms, cotton cloth firms, and thread-piling firms to register their existing stocks of cotton yarn and cloth with their respective trade associations within four days (14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th) for the Textile Adjustment Committee to record. Cotton yarn and cloth that are not registered after the deadline will be deemed as hoarded and will be confiscated.  Starting from the 14th (today), the Textile Adjustment Committee will send additional personnel to conduct audits jointly with the Economic Police. They will first investigate accounts of cotton yarn and cloth purchases since July 1st, and then investigate the uses of the purchases. If hoarding exceeding the prescribed period of one and a half months is discovered, the items will be purchased at the original price. If any instances of "passing the buck" are discovered, the individuals will be subject to confiscation or other penalties under the Regulations for the Suppression of Hoarding and Profiteering of Daily Necessities.  For those who refuse to submit account books or refuse audits, the managers and supervisors of the firms will be detained for seven days in accordance with the Police Law, without imposing fines. If the account books are still not submitted within seven days, the detention will continue.  Encouraging confidential reporting and awarding rewards according to the method recently approved by the Economic Supervisory Committee's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Group.  As cotton yarn is subject to allocated prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee will also set a reasonable price for reprocessing. Strict measures will also be taken if the price of cotton cloth exceeds this prescribed price. Other audit measures will be implemented for cotton cloth in the same manner as for cotton yarn. Mayor Wu estimates that non-industry individuals are currently hoarding approximately 20,000 to 30,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3>Investigation Reveals Speculation and Hoarding as the Root Cause of Rising Prices in Various Markets; Xu Youzuo Provides a Report with Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Our Newspaper) After Police Bureau Economic Section Chief Xu Youzuo inspected the conditions of various markets with Textile Adjustment Committee Inspector Tan Yili, he drafted a report and countermeasures, which were submitted to the Municipal Government last night. The contents are divided into five categories: (A)</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, various groups in the cotton cloth market were very active, and speculators were heard to be active, engaging in much whispered secret trading. The prices of Longtou fine cloth, Sijunzi cloth, and various other types of cloth were rising madly, due to the soaring price of raw cotton. Factories were restricting sales due to rising costs of dyes and materials. Non-industry merchants continued to absorb supply, and the association's sudden abolition of the transaction form yesterday further disrupted the market, which actually fueled the fire. Countermeasures:  Order the trade association to strictly enforce the transaction form system. If the information reported is found to be false, the Textile Adjustment Committee can purchase the goods at the declared price.  Suppress the prices of cotton, cotton yarn, and dyes to reduce costs.  Eliminate the broker system to prevent exploitation.  The Textile Adjustment Committee should strictly order China Textile to supply cotton cloth to the market to balance supply and demand.  Since there are currently no price limits or negotiated prices for cotton cloth, how can cloth prices not rise? The regulatory authorities should quickly devise effective suppression measures so that the police bureau can enforce them. (B)</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market appeared relatively calm yesterday due to a slightly later opening, but merchants were still whispering and trading privately. The price of 20-count yarn rose by more than 2 million again. Trade association officials repeatedly cited imbalances in supply and demand as an excuse, but the main reasons were still the mutual purchasing by industry and non-industry merchants, withholding goods from sale, and speculators stirring up trouble, creating a sense of panic. Countermeasures: Eliminate the psychological factors of panic in the cotton yarn market. The Textile Adjustment Committee should supply the market as much as possible so that those holding goods are willing to sell, and hoarders will no longer compete to purchase.  Strictly enforce the transaction form system.  Eliminate brokers and directly allocate sales to producers to reduce the price exploitation by middlemen and reduce production costs. (C)</p>
<p>Rayon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of each piece suddenly rose by more than 10 million, setting a new record for price increases. It has been found that although rayon is allocated and sold by the Central Trust Bureau, it has been repeatedly transferred into the hands of speculators, who treat it as a "passing the buck" transaction. Countermeasures: The Central Trust Bureau bears the heavy responsibility of regulating rayon and should supply the market as much as possible to balance supply and demand.  Directly allocate sales to manufacturers. Strictly prevent the allocated rayon from flowing into the black market.  The trade association should strictly enforce the rayon transaction form system to facilitate investigation. (D)</p>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>The price of rice was 585,000 last week and has already exceeded 800,000 yesterday. The Rice Market is now regularly monitored by personnel dispatched by the Social Affairs Bureau Grain Administration Section. Countermeasures: Since the City has increased the allocation of rice by 100,000 dan, the allocation committee should be ordered to take the timing into account and quickly allocate sales, especially to the lower-middle class.  The smuggling of rice by factories and schools should also be investigated and prohibited.  Rice stores should sell rice at the prescribed standard price.  Stabilize public morale. Rice stores that refuse to sell rice should be sealed up, and the allocation committee should sell the rice at a fair price.  (E)</p>
<p>Gold and Currency</p>
<p>The black market remains rampant. Countermeasures:  In addition to confiscation, criminal liability should be imposed for buying gold and foreign currency.  Encourage confidential reporting, with no limit to the amount of the reward. A method for dealing with privately held gold should be established quickly to prevent it from flowing into the black market.  Except for the Central Bank, other public commercial institutions should not accept U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies at discounted rates.</p>
<p>Chief Fang and Others Invited to Give Moral Speeches to New Recruits</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper) Starting yesterday, the Shanghai Garrison Command, led by Commander Chen of the Group Regiment, invited Chief Fang, Chairman Pan, Director Zhang, and others to give moral speeches at the new recruit camps, in order to enhance the new recruits' intelligence and strengthen their confidence in serving.</p>

<h3>Suspected of Concealing Traitorous Assets: Manager of Tianfaxiang Indicted</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Tianfaxiang Leather Goods Store was originally located on Henan Road, and Shao Shi-jun, a traitor, was one of its major shareholders. After the victory, the store failed in business. This spring, the manager Jiang Zhigang sold the building to the Bank of China, with the price being fifty gold bars (i.e., five hundred taels). The Bank of China paid fourteen gold bars in advance, with thirty-six bars remaining. However, in February, the government announced an order prohibiting the circulation of gold and banknotes, so the price was converted to 5.4 million legal tender per bar and distributed according to the share amount. Shao's share was thirty gold taels, worth over 20 million legal tender. However, Jiang failed to report this to the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office, suspected of concealing traitorous assets. After being reported, the High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, the High Court held a hearing. According to Jiang, the funds for Shao's share have all been handed over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office. The court stated that further investigation was needed, and he was released on the original bail for a future hearing.</p>

<h3>Lonely Childhood, Tragic End: Career Failure and Hundreds of Millions in Debt, Yue Opera Star Xiao Dangui Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Xiao Dangui (see photo), one of the five great leading actresses of the old-school Yue Opera, whose real name was Qian Chunfeng, aged 27, suddenly ingested a large amount of Lysol behind people's backs yesterday afternoon and died at 6:15 PM.</p>
<p>Before taking the poison, Xiao Dangui was alone in her residence around 5 PM. A neighbor, Wei Meiying, invited her to Wei's house for refreshments, but Xiao Dangui politely declined, falsely claiming that she was feeling unwell, and pretended to nap in Wei's bedroom. She repeatedly urged Wei Meiying to go out for a hair wash. Wei then went out and returned in about thirty minutes. By then, Xiao Dangui had left Wei's house and returned to her residence. Wei went to look for her and smelled a strong Lysol odor in her room. At the same time, she found that she had taken poison. A Lysol bottle left on the dresser was empty. She immediately called her husband, Zhang Chunfan, and her sister, Qian Qiong, to rush her to the Sino-American Hospital for rescue, but the poisoning was too deep, and she died at 6:15 PM. Xiao Dangui was wearing a plaid spun silk short shirt and pants, a purple silk lined robe, a green velvet jacket, nylon stockings, and white satin shoes when she died. As for the reason for the suicide, it is said to be due to financial problems and temporary financial difficulties. Since Xiao Dangui started operating the Guotai Grand Theater last year, performing Yue Opera, business has been slow, with debts amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan. At the same time, she was greatly stimulated by the fact that she had bought a house in Hangzhou, which was occupied by others and could not be used by herself, leading to this tragic suicide. It is reported that Xiao Dangui came from a poor background and joined the Shengxian County Gaosheng Stage at the age of thirteen to learn opera. At that time, both her parents had passed away, and she was lonely and helpless, spending her childhood under the strict supervision of the municipal government. Eight years ago, Xiao Dangui came to Shanghai and became famous performing at the "Zhedong Theater" and the "Empire Theater."</p>
<h3>Four New Regulations for Advance Booking of Jinghu Railway Tickets: No More Than Three Tickets Two Days Before Departure</h3>
<p>(Our Report) Since the Shanghai Passenger Transportation Office of the Jinghu Railway Bureau launched services such as "advance ticket booking" and "special delivery of tickets," the results have been quite good. However, the general public is often unclear about the methods and procedures for advance ticket booking. There are often people who write or call to book tickets ten days before departure, or even book ten or twenty tickets at a time, which is inconsistent with the bureau's original method of "booking tickets three days in advance, no more than three tickets per household." As a result, there are dozens of inquiries by letter or telephone every day, which greatly affects work efficiency. The bureau has recently revised four new regulations, stipulating:</p>
<p>From the date of this announcement, whether booking tickets in person or by phone, it will be changed to two days before the departure date (for example, on the 15th, you can book tickets for departure on the 17th). If you book tickets between 5:30 PM and 11:00 PM, it can be counted as the next day (i.e., between 5:30 PM and 11:00 PM on the 15th, you can book tickets for departure on the 18th). The limit per household is no more than three tickets. Ticket booking by mail shall be handled in accordance with the above two regulations, and the time of receipt of the letter by the office shall prevail. If the date is too early or the number of tickets booked exceeds the limit, it will not be processed, nor will there be a separate reply. Passengers booking tickets by mail must indicate the postal district code (5) or (23) for swift delivery. The address of the office is No. 1451 North Sichuan Road, Shanghai (5), phone: 44146, 44149, or (02) 61068, 60689. The address of the branch office is No. 128 Yuyuan Road, Shanghai (23), phone: 60121, 60122.</p>

All those on board were killed, including several National Assembly representatives and the famous actress Li Shifang, shocking the nation. After an investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office, the suspects included Chen Xie, the general manager of the China National Aviation Corporation, Wu Zhi, the head of the aircraft navigation group, Chen Hongen, the deputy head, and two mechanics who inspected the aircraft before takeoff. However, the prosecutor's investigation concluded that the aircraft was thoroughly inspected before takeoff, and the weather changed when flying to Qingdao, causing it to hit the mountain peak. This was not the fault of the company personnel and did not constitute the crime of manslaughter. The case was closed yesterday with a decision not to prosecute.</p>

<h3>Speaking of the Shandong War Situation, Talk about the Central Plains War Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan 8th Dispatch] The Communist bandits originally had three major base areas in the country: one was Shaanxi North, the second was Shandong, and the third was the Northeast. Now, following Shaanxi North, all areas south of the Yellow River in Shandong, except for the three counties of Wendeng, Rongcheng, and Haiyang in Jiaodong, are under the control of the National Army. The destruction of the Shandong base area, which the Communist bandits had painstakingly managed for over a decade and was regarded as the party, government, and military center "south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River," is something that anyone with a slight understanding of the Communist bandits' internal situation fully knows has caused them great pain and had a profound impact. There is no doubt that the gains and losses on the Shandong battlefield have a decisive effect on the overall war situation in the country.</p>
<p>In order to counter the National Army's suppression, the Communist bandits' operational guidance and tactical thinking have undergone three major transformations, or can be said to be three major stages, on the Shandong battlefield and even expanded for use on the national battlefield.</p>
<p>The First Stage</p>
<p>Was before the Battle of Laiwu on February 23 of this year. During this period, the Communist bandits' strategy was "guerilla warfare as the main method, supplemented by mobile warfare." The strategic thinking of Mao, Zhu, Liu (Bocheng), and Chen (Yi) was "evade if the enemy is superior, annihilate if the enemy is inferior." Therefore, the operational guiding principle they adhered to was "avoid decisive battles," which was exactly the opposite of the National Army's "seeking decisive battles." Therefore, even if we only discuss the Shandong battlefield, this period was actually "fighting without engaging," and naturally there was no talk of "decisive battles."</p>
<p>The Second Stage</p>
<p>Took mobile warfare as the main method, supplemented by guerilla warfare. In terms of time, it was from the Battle of Laiwu at the end of January of this year to the Battle of Linqu at the end of July. Because the Communist bandits gained some advantages in the battles of Menglianggu (northeast of Mengyin) and Tai'an after the Battle of Laiwu, they believed that as long as they concentrated their large forces, formed a local advantage, and launched突擊s on a certain point or several points of the National Army, they could definitely achieve the same results as Laiwu or Menglianggu. Therefore, during this period, the operational rule grasped by the bandits was "strike the main force, disperse the main force, freeze the main force, consume the main force." What was seen in concrete actions was when the National Army advanced in parallel from west to east from Laiwu, Xin'tai, and Mengyin in late June, directly attacking the key points of the Communist bandits' Yimeng Mountain area such as Ma'an, Yue Village, and Donglidian. Chen Yi not only did not try to rescue them, but instead used his main force to cooperate with the part of Liu Bocheng's force that had withdrawn from northern Henan to northwestern Shandong and crossed the Yellow River on the 29th of the previous month to besiege Jinan, Tengxian, Yangshanj集 (north of Jixiang), Zou County, Yanzhou, Sishui and other places in southwestern Shandong, attempting to actively occupy these places, consume the National Army, and passively obstruct and contain the advancing National Army to the east. However, no one can have everything their way. What the Communist bandits encountered in the above-mentioned places was a series of hard nails. Not only did their plans fail, but they turned from "avoiding battle" to delivering themselves to be beaten. As a result, although Liu Bandit's losses in the twenty-odd battles were only over 30,000 people, Chen Bandit's losses were at least over 70,000 people. Therefore, Chen Yi could not help but be somewhat</p>
<p>Flustered</p>
<p>After the "besieging Wei to rescue Zhao" plan failed, he had no choice but to retreat north again with his remaining main force, starting on July 19th, attacking Nanma, attempting to rescue his old nest in the mountainous area. But to make matters worse, he ran into the most elite old troops of Chen Cheng, Hu Lian's troops. Thus, after three days of fierce fighting, Chen Yi lost more than 30,000 people. Seeing that the attack on Nanma was unsuccessful, Chen Yi believed that Li Mi's troops, who had only six regiments and were stationed south of Weixian in Linqu at this time, were weak and could be deceived. He abandoned Nanma and besieged Linqu. After eight days of fierce fighting, he lost more than 40,000 people. By July 30th, the National Army's reinforcements arrived one after another. At this time, Chen Yi, who was already exhausted, had no fighting spirit and was deeply afraid of being annihilated. He fled to the north bank of the Yellow River, forming a complete retreat in the book. By this time, Chen Yi, who had boasted of having 230,000 troops after reorganization, had only 70,000 troops left. All of his rapid column's heavy weapons, unable to be transported across the Yellow River, were mostly buried in the area between the Xia Qing River and the Jiaoji Railway. The "July Offensive," led by the most tenacious Liu and Chen bandits from within the customs, which was supposed to "unveil the prelude to the great counteroffensive," had fallen from its peak to its lowest point.</p>
<p>The Third Stage</p>
<p>Due to the painful lessons learned in the second stage, the Shandong Communist bandits adopted a strategy that reverted to the first stage from August until recently. During this period, the Communist bandits, seeing that Jiaodong could not be defended and that the only route for receiving supplies from the Northeast was destined to be cut off, decided that rather than retreating to the north bank of the Yellow River to be beaten, it was better to "use the enemy's rear as the front," strive for the initiative, and adopt the "exchange space for space" tactic. Thus, Liu Bocheng's five columns, which were entrenched in the relatively complete southwestern Shandong, first crossed the Longhai Railway and fled to the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. At the same time, Chen Geng's troops in southern Shanxi also crossed the Yellow River and harassed Heluo in order to support and contain the Central Plains National Army. Following this, the remaining main force of Chen Yi, which had fled to the north bank of the Yellow River for replenishment and training and was not yet mature, consisting of six columns including the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 13th (of which the 13th column was part of Liu Bocheng's force and was placed under Chen Yi's command), also followed suit and crossed the Longhai Railway south on September 26 after failing to retreat to their old base in Yimeng. Chen Yi's original intention was to retreat to northern Jiangsu, but he was blocked and fled west to join Liu Bocheng.</p>
<p>At this time, the Communist bandits in Jiaodong also shouted out a new slogan, which was: "Abandon Shandong, but not Jiaodong; abandon Jiaodong, but not the Three Mountains; abandon the Three Mountains, but not the Shandong youth."</p>
<p>The so-called Three Mountains</p>
<p>Refer to Dazeshan (near Pingdu), Juchiya Mountain (southeast of Haiyang), and Kunlun Mountain (southeast of Muping) in Jiaodong. In terms of scale, the Three Mountains are not as large as Yishan and Mengshan in the Yimeng Mountain area, but they are more险峻. Juchiya Mountain is the most险峻. As early as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist bandits managed them as the largest base for entering and exiting Jiaodong. There are natural caves and artificial tunnels, with all the caves connected and all the mountains jointly defending. There are arsenals, granaries, and warehouses in the caves. In particular, the number of grains, ammunition, and weapons stored in the warehouses cannot be estimated. The工事s are so strong that even the enemy's large-scale sweeps during the War of Resistance Against Japan failed to flatten them. Fortunately, the National Army has first cleared all the Communist bandits in Dazeshan and completely surrounded Juchiya Mountain. The bandits on Kunlun Mountain will also be easily cleared.</p>
<p>In short, although there are still seven regular army columns (the 2nd, 9th, and 7th columns and part of the 13th column are between Gaomi and Changyi; the main force of the 13th column is on Kunlun Mountain; the 10th and 11th columns are in Liangshan in southwestern Shandong - the 11th column is temporarily under Chen's command by Liu; and the Liangguang Column is in Dezhou in northern Shandong) and 100,000 local troops remaining in Shandong this month, it is still a</p>
<p>Difficult task</p>
<p>For the government to suppress the remaining bandits and pacify the local areas. (The reason why this task is difficult is that after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Li Yannian, who was in charge of Shandong's military affairs, reduced the local游繫隊 to nothing. Before the government's local armed forces are fully rebuilt, if the National Army's regular troops leave Shandong, the security of each county town may also have problems at any time.) But there is no doubt that the defeat of Chen Yi's original main force, the destruction of Chen Yi's Shandong base area, and the retreat of Liu and Chen's remaining main forces far away from their base area to the south are precisely the successes of the National Army's core tactical application. Liu and Chen are forced to retreat to guerilla warfare as the main method and mobile warfare as the supplement in strategy. All of this is a serious failure for the Communist bandits. Conversely, the serious failure of the Communist bandits is precisely the victory and success of the National Army.</p>
<p>Since Liu Bocheng fled south, the</p>
<p>Gan-E-Yu-Wan</p>
<p>Military Region has now been formally established, with Liu serving as the commander of the military region and the commander of the Central Plains Field Army concurrently. The former position of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region is now taken over by Nie Rongzhen. From this, it can be seen that at least Liu Bandit will not主动 flee for the time being, but will think of rebuilding his Central Plains Military Region. Although Chen Yi has temporarily joined forces with Liu, retreating to northern Jiangsu is his most desired first move, because northern Jiangsu is his old nest, Huaiyin. Even now, Chen Bandit's 11th and 12th columns, totaling about 20,000 people, are still scattered and lurking in northern Jiangsu. However, if there is an opportunity, retreating to Shandong again is also very possible, because he still兼攝s the commander of his Shandong Military Region. "Crossing the river this year and crossing the Yangtze River next year" is completely a practical offensive of the Communist bandits. In the Guannei, the National Army, which has now changed the Central Plains battlefield into the main battlefield, is using unparalleled perseverance and courage to shatter this attempt of the Communist bandits.

<h3>Xiamen Customs Intercepts Huge Amount of Smuggled Gold</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xiamen 8th Dispatch] The Xiamen Customs recently received a tip that the Taiping Wheel, which sails between the Philippines and Xiamen, was smuggling a large amount of gold to Xiamen. The ship arrived in Xiamen a few days ago, and the customs immediately sent officers to board the ship for inspection. They found more than 40 Mexican gold bars, each weighing eight liang and three qian, totaling more than 300 liang, in the drawers of Room No. 2 in first class and Room No. 3 in second class.

<h3>Inside Story of the Labor Strike at Qingdao Qilu Company Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Qingdao 9th Dispatch] The Qingdao Qilu Enterprise Company's Rubber Factory, in order to cooperate with the National General Mobilization Order and to supply rubber products required by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Communications, has established a production increase incentive program, increasing work by two hours per day, and giving each increased product a treatment of one and a half pieces. Since the factory proposed this motion, a small number of workers, not understanding the factory's motives, incited obstruction, and started a strike on August 12, refusing to extend the work, but demanding an increase in treatment. After repeated persuasion by the factory and mediation by the Social Bureau, there was no effect. Finally, the mayor arbitrated and changed the increase time in the production increase plan to one hour, and the treatment for each increased product was also increased by 20% compared to the original, calculated at 1.7. Since September 11, the worker side, due to the control of a small number of workers, did not follow the enemy's stipulated time, and the factory union set its own time to go to and from work, and the work efficiency was extremely low. The municipal authorities were very dissatisfied with this. In addition to ordering the union to stop its activities and wait for reorganization, the factory was allowed to dismiss the leading troublemakers, and strictly ordered to implement the regulations. If there were still those who did not comply, they could be refused entry into the factory. At 7:30 on the 13th, the workers gathered in the streets, seemingly manipulated by someone, and did not dare to enter the factory. The enemy side waited until 7:45, then closed the gate and temporarily suspended work. Later, they received an order from the Social Bureau that from the 21st, all workers who were willing to accept the factory's regulations should register. After registration, work would resume. On the evening of the 30th, registration was completed, and all work resumed on the morning of October 1st. However, on the day of resumption, the secretary of the general union actually released the absurd news that the factory had recognized four conditions for resumption, disrupting the public's perception to a great extent. The Social Bureau and the factory have separately corrected this. It is now known that the factory has submitted a statement to the Social Bureau, stating that this incorrect news is feared to cause other incidents and requesting serious attention.</p>

<h3>A Brief Look at Shanghai University</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>In Mr. Hu Shi's "Ten-Year Education Plan," he believed that the thirteen church universities in the country were relatively serious and successful in their education and should be included in the second batch of schools for development.</p>
<p>Indeed, among these thirteen church universities, especially in Shanghai, St. John's, Soochow, and Hangzhou Christian College were exceptional institutions.</p>
<p>According to the Academic Dean's report, Shanghai University has a total of 1,066 students this semester (male to female ratio: 55.5% male, 44.5% female), all of whom live on campus. This alone is enough to demonstrate the students' pursuit of knowledge and the simple academic atmosphere of Shanghai University.</p>
<p>In the 1947 new student enrollment, a total of 2,527 people applied in two rounds, with about a quarter being admitted, totaling 663 students. Before the start of this semester, all new students participated in new student training to give them a deep understanding of the school.</p>
<p>At the first weekly meeting of the semester, President Ling, who had just returned from the United States, personally attended and presided. He frankly stated the crux of the problems of the previous semester. Finally, he said in an extremely sincere tone: "Our Shanghai University is a big family. I hope that political parties will withdraw to create a peaceful and democratic new Shanghai University."</p>
<p>The spirit of a big family has indeed been fully demonstrated at Shanghai University. Once, a minor incident was triggered by careless washing of food in the men's dining hall. President Ling then announced in a democratic manner at a weekly meeting: "I have received many signed letters from male students telling me that unclean food has caused more than half of the students to suffer from diarrhea. I am willing to thoroughly investigate this matter!" As a result, the men's kitchen was replaced, and a dietary committee was organized by the students to manage it.</p>
<p>On the evening of September 22nd, a grand faculty-student social gathering was held in the auditorium. All faculty members and their wives attended. Among the performances, the "electric piano" solo by Mrs. Zhu Qidong, professor of the Music Department, was the most appreciated. The sound of the piano resembled a guzheng and a stringed instrument. The faculty and students enjoyed themselves to the fullest that day, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.</p>
<p>On the Mid-Autumn Festival evening, the Botanical Garden designed by Dr. Zheng Zhangcheng, Dean of the College of Science and Director of the Biology Department, was inaugurated. The Shanghai University Orchestra performed musical programs, which brought some comfort to the students' homesickness in this beautiful moonlit night. The biological garden is located near the Huangpu River, with lush trees, lotus ponds, and small bridges, providing another place for students to relax and chat after class. The students are all very happy about this.</p>
<p>November 8th is the anniversary of the school. A parents' day is planned to celebrate together. Preparations have already begun. In addition to the flower and tree donations from the student union in the campus, the construction of a fountain, sundial, and drinking fountain has also begun.</p>
<p>The gas equipment in the science building has been installed. The students of the Chemistry Department, who have been negotiating for years, all consider it great news. It will greatly increase the convenience for future experiments. Once the boiler is repaired, gas can be produced to supply the entire school. Amid the calls for power saving, this is another good news. A set of papermaking machines donated by Mr. Chen Pengnian, general manager of the Jiangnan Paper Mill, has been installed in the papermaking workshop. It is currently undergoing trial runs day and night and will soon be officially put into operation. The students of the Chemistry Department are particularly excited and are now buying work clothes, their faces full of spring breeze.</p>
<p>The physics students are unwilling to let the biology and chemistry departments have all the spotlight. They have now established a new weather forecasting station, truly competing with each other.</p>
<p>The volunteer primary school run by the education students has achieved remarkable results and has been expanded. Children of faculty and staff, as well as out-of-school children from nearby villages, can enroll nearby. This and the internship of the sociology students—the Shanghai East Commune—are known as Shanghai University's two major charitable initiatives.</p>
<p>Many new faculty and staff were hired in 1947. The three-story faculty apartment building, which began construction this summer, has been completed. The interior is equipped with complete sanitary facilities, and the exterior is magnificent. It is the most sublime of the existing apartments on campus. The total cost is more than 70,000 US dollars, adding a new look to the whole school. Female students occupy "Si Lei" and "Si Meng" halls, first-year male students live in Si Yi hall, second-year students live in Si Pei hall, and third- and fourth-year students live in "Men's Dormitory," which is called Women's Hall in English.</p>
<p>The school authorities pay much attention to students' extracurricular activities and sports. The previous session won four championships in "Mandarin Speech," "English Speech," men's track and field, and women's basketball, establishing Shanghai University's reputation. Therefore, various competitions have recently started on campus to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>During this trip to the United States, President Ling reported to the church on the recent situation of Shanghai University, attended the Danish Baptist Conference, and spoke on the current situation of education in China. In addition to receiving an honorary doctorate in the United States, he also visited universities in the United Kingdom and the United States for reference. We hope that he can continue to develop Shanghai University with the vigor of a young man (President Ling is the youngest university president) and make it the first-class institution of higher learning in Shanghai!</p>

<h3>Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Imported Goods to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, the official of the Transport Management Committee said yesterday that the government will solve this problem soon, and there is no problem for the imported goods for which foreign exchange has been settled. In particular, industrial raw materials will be given priority. What the government is currently considering is the goods that have been imported but not settled. It is feared that once they are opened up, it will be necessary to search for them in the black market, and they are deeply wary of the recent fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Therefore, there are some differences of opinion between the Transport Management Committee and the Executive Yuan. However, the handling measures should be announced in the short term.</p>
<h3>South China Transport Management Committee Considers Common Certificates</h3>
<p>The use of Hong Kong's Common Certificates has caused fluctuations in the Hong Kong market. On the 22nd of last month, the South China Customs stopped using them. After the request of overseas Chinese businessmen, it was approved again on the 2nd of this month that those issued before the 21st of last month were still valid. As a result, various parties continued to compete for the Common Certificates.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Transport Management Committee, he said: Regarding the situation of the Common Certificates, no report has been received so far. The so-called Common Certificates were originally issued by the South China Import and Export Management Committee and the Customs to facilitate border merchants to transport livestock, eggs, and the like, duty-free and without foreign exchange settlement, to Hong Kong for sale. At the same time, they would use the Hong Kong dollars they sold to purchase materials of equivalent value, and the Customs would issue a "Agricultural Products Exchange Import Certificate," which was originally a very good intention. However, it was exploited by some special people, who rushed to buy them and purchase imported materials, thus becoming Common Certificates, which was completely unexpected at the time. The South China Transport Management Committee and the Customs are taking effective measures to deal with this situation, and whether to continue issuing them is also determined by the South China Transport Management Committee.</p>
<h3>Improving the Cotton Yarn Price Negotiation System, Measures Still Under Discussion, Allocated Yarn Maintains Original Price, Black Market Prices Soar</h3>

<p>Yarn Prices Soar</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton yarn market, economic police [missing character] (came to supervise, so that each yarn was traded with a legal profit of 5% in addition to the limit price, but very few speculators arrived, resulting in no formal transactions and a standstill. However, there were still sporadic bidding outside the market, and the rise was even more fierce, with 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn approaching the 40 million yuan mark, shouted at 39 million yuan. 40-count was 34.5 million yuan, 32-count Silver Moon was 30 million yuan, 20-count Double Horse was 25.5 million yuan, and 16-count Guangming was 25 million yuan, most of which rose by 2 to 3 million yuan each. Also: The Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual, with no price change. There were ten types of A-group replica manufacturers, 1,550 pieces, each piece with an additional 250,000 yuan for flood relief costs in addition to the list price, and 922 households applied for purchase. It is reported that B-group yarn merchants have suspended allocation this period.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the opening was due to frequent withdrawals by floating funds and customers, and the market was unanimously [missing character] high due to soaring raw material prices. Manufacturers did not open, chips became scarcer, and the market rose sharply. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth jumped from 925,000 yuan to 990,000 yuan, and it was still difficult to collect, a sharp [missing character] of 130,000 yuan compared to Saturday. Other grades of fine cloth also rose sharply by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan each. Later, due to the economic police [missing character] supervising the market, the atmosphere inside the market suddenly [missing character] dissipated, and buying and selling stopped. However, the Dragon Head fine cloth price outside the market was shouted at 1.03 million yuan, and Four Gentlemen fabric was shouted at 1.23 million yuan, with no formal transactions.

<h3>Authorities Deny Issuance of Large Denomination Notes</h3>
<p>At a time when prices are soaring and people's livelihoods are difficult, it was rumored in the market that the National Bank of China intends to print large denomination notes of 50,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan to meet current needs, which gave the market a major stimulus. According to inquiries with relevant parties, it was generally believed that there was no such thing, and there was no need for it now, and they all solemnly denied it. Not long ago, there was a similar rumor in the market that large denomination notes would be issued. The spokesman of the National Bank of China has already denied it. Unexpectedly, not long after, the rumors started again, and the relevant authorities will investigate those who deliberately spread [missing character] rumors.</p>

<h3>Tea Market Transactions Scarce</h3>
<p>Since the huge fluctuations in commodity prices in this city, tea merchants' minds are unwilling to lie low.

Other types of export teas are also similar. The market is quite quiet. Looking at this situation, there is hope for a prosperous future.</p>
<h3>Northern Transportation Frequently Blocked, Affecting Coal Transport, Coal Prices Rise Due to Abnormal Supply</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to information from the Fuel Management Committee: On the Beining Railway line, between Shanhaiguan and Tangshan, railway sabotage has been frequent since late last month. Traffic has been intermittent, and military transport has to be maintained occasionally, resulting in reduced coal transport volume. A telegram received on the 8th of this month from Qinhuangdao stated that the committee had five ships loading coal there, including the "Tangshan," which were temporarily ordered to suspend loading for official duties by the local military authorities and only returned on the 10th, which greatly affected coal transport. Also, the "Tianxing" and "Nanshan" ships were requisitioned for official duties after arriving in Taiwan and were only allowed to leave in early this month, affecting the amount of coal arriving in Taiwan.</p>
<p>The committee has been increasing the monthly supply of coal for military and public use in Qingdao. The plan for this month is 15,000 tons. Recently, due to the obstruction of coal sources, the planned shipment of coal cannot be delivered on time. Currently, the "New China" ship, which is already loaded with coal en route, has been ordered to rush to Qingdao, carrying a total of 7,200 tons, of which 3,000 tons are allocated to the China Textile Corporation and 4,200 tons to the power plant. The Taipei office has also been ordered to load 5,000 tons of coal in Qinhuangdao and transport it to Qingdao immediately.</p>
<p>It is now known that the coal in use at the coal plant there can last until the 17th of this month. With the additional coal supply transported by ships dispatched by the committee, there is no risk of power outages in Qingdao. Furthermore, the Beining Railway has recently been repaired through continuous efforts, and railway transport has returned to normal since the 10th. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been consulted to request that coal transport ships be exempted from requisition.</p>
<p>Also, the supply of coal for military and public use in this city has never been interrupted. Although general coal transport has experienced malfunctions upon arrival in Shanghai, the committee's supply has been maintained. Since manufacturers have been allowed to transport their own coal, over the past two weeks, a total of more than 18,000 tons of self-transported coal has arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the rise in coal prices is due to an abnormal supply-demand situation. The fourth phase of factory coal has been increased from 15,000 tons to 20,000 tons and will be distributed soon. It is expected that coal prices will return to normal soon.</p>
<h3>Speculative Funds Cause Waves, Chinese Stocks Rise Sharply and Fall Back Quickly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks suddenly experienced a general surge, especially second-tier and miscellaneous stocks. As the authorities are monitoring the markets more closely, speculators have infiltrated Chinese stocks in large numbers. At noon, a sharp rise was reported, with 70-80% of stocks hitting their daily limit. In the afternoon, credit tightened, and there were rumors of borrowing. After rising sharply, stocks quickly fell back.</p>
<p>Morning Session</p>
<p>Seeing Hsiu, No. 160 and others bought in. No. 188 and others bought Yungsha, pushing it up to 333 yuan for immediate delivery and 336 yuan for forward delivery. No. 202 and others took advantage of the high price to sell off, and Meiya was very popular, with No. 117 and others scrambling to buy it. Yungsha was again pushed up to 335 yuan and 340 yuan by No. 223 and others. Commercial Press first hit the daily limit through No. 116's bid, and Sino-Foreign also turned strong through No. 152's absorption. After 10:30, as off-market interest rates opened as high as 22.5 cents and 27 cents, No. 107 and others sold Yungsha for immediate delivery, and No. 202 and others also closed out Yungsha for forward delivery, falling back slightly by 56 yuan. Yung Chong was pushed to the daily limit by No. 157 and others, China Silk by No. 219, and New Asia Underwear and King Lun were pushed to the limit by No. 231. For a time, buying was very strong. As various industries were strictly prohibited from engaging in activities, a large amount of speculative funds poured in. Near noon, No. 154 and others all entered. Yungsha rose to a high of 350 yuan for immediate delivery and 358 yuan for forward delivery. French Sino-Chinese Northern Match, Pen Mud, and Meiya Sino-Foreign all approached their limits. No. 171 took advantage of the high price to forcefully sell Yungsha for immediate delivery, and then closed at 350 yuan and 357 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Meiya, French Sino-Chinese Northern, United Match, Yung Chong, King Lun, Commercial Press, Match, Cement, New Asia Underwear, and China Silk all hit their daily limits for immediate delivery shares. Sino-Foreign, China General, and New Kwanghua all rose by 15%, Yungsha, China Textile, and New China rose by 10%, King Fook rose by 5%, and Hengfeng rose slightly. For forward delivery shares, Meiya hit the daily limit, Yungsha Sino-Foreign rose by 10%, and China General and New Kwanghua rose by 15%.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session</p>
<p>Riding on the momentum of the morning session, the market opened higher. Northern Match Commercial Press, Yung Chong, Li An, China Silk, French Sino-Chinese, and others continued to hit their daily limits. However, after seeing 357 yuan and 362 yuan for Yungsha, profit-taking emerged. No. 76 and others sold off, and No. 234 and others sold Yungsha for immediate delivery, falling back slightly to 349 yuan and 351 yuan. Meiya was still pushed to the daily limit by No. 117 and others, and No. 126 and others absorbed it at low prices. No. 45 and others bought Yungsha for immediate delivery, pushing it up to 353 yuan and 358 yuan. Later, it was rumored that the US loan had been agreed upon in principle in the evening papers, and the National Bank's exchange rate improved, causing credit to tighten. More people sold off. No. 32 and others sold off, and No. 76 and others sold Yungsha for immediate delivery again, gradually falling to a low of 3126 yuan and 338 yuan. No. 116 and others still absorbed it at low prices, and Yungsha rose back to 343 yuan and 345 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to the morning close, Yungsha, China General, New Kwanghua, King Fook, French Sino-Chinese, New China, New Asia, Match, and Yung Chong all fell slightly for immediate delivery shares. Hengfeng, China Textile, and Sino-Foreign rose slightly, and Sino-Foreign, Meiya, United Match, King Lun, and Underwear fell by about 0.5%. Commercial Press rose to the limit by Silk Northern. For forward delivery shares, Meiya, China General, and New Kwanghua fell by 0.5%, and the rest fell slightly. On the off-market, old shares such as China, World, Pudong, Five Continents, and Guan Sheng Yuan all rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly to 0.5%.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest in Unified Bonds, Foreign Stocks Retreated After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, government bonds saw active buying interest, and the opening trend was prosperous. Room 503 sold, while Ta Cheng New Rooms 550 and 552 bought in. Unified Bond C opened at 155,000 yuan, rising from 154,000 yuan to 167,000 yuan, and then turned to a fluctuating pattern. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B rose by 800 yuan, C rose by 1,000 yuan, and D and E rose by 600 yuan, with a turnover of about 4 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks continued to advance to new highs, but retreated after rising. Jardine Silk opened initially at 188,000 yuan, rising to the 200,000 yuan mark, and then fell back 10,000 yuan before struggling to end. British Union fell back slightly from 260,000 yuan to around 245,000 yuan at the close. Securities companies and banking groups bought, while foreign firms and Guangdong firms sold. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jardine Beer rose by 0.5%, Cultivation rose by 10%, John D. Hutchison's Industry and Guangdong Telephone were flat, and the rest of the stocks saw slight gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Silk Production and Sales Association Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee held its 25th meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday in the committee's conference room. Tan Xuehong, the chairman, first reported on the purchase volume of spring silk and the work overview of the Silk Management Office, followed by a discussion of proposals before adjourning.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes and Soap Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cigarette prices opened lower in the morning due to shipments being dispatched, and fellow merchants dumped stock, causing more to enter the market, and causing it to fall. The market was active with buyers during the afternoon, and prices recovered.</p>
<p>Daily necessities and soap saw a slight retreat in the morning, but the market was more active in the afternoon. Brands such as Gu Ben, Scissors, Guanghua, and Mao Niupi all saw price increases. Matches, New Phoenix, and Mei Li all rose, and miscellaneous brands also saw increases.</p>

<h3>Talking About Shanghai Telephones</h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>1.  Two Different Telephone Systems Create Many Shortcomings</p>
<p>Previously, Shanghai's city telephones were operated separately by two organizations: the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company. The Shanghai Telephone Company's business area included the former International Settlement and the French Concession, as well as the extra-settlement road areas in northwestern Sichuan Road. Its machinery adopted a rotary automatic system. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau's area included the urban area outside the above-mentioned areas, and its machinery adopted a step-by-step automatic system. After the victory, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau received the "Shanghai Telephone Administration Bureau" of the puppet "Huazhong Electric Communications Company," returned the occupied part of the telephone company to its original owner, and assigned the former Shanghai Telephone Bureau to the Party Telecommunications Bureau, and all systems remained as before. The telephone company operates in commercially prosperous areas, with more than 58,000 current users and nine branch offices. Its telephone numbers are arranged as follows:</p>
<p>Central Bureau "1" automatic telephone capacity 9,300 numbers</p>
<p>Hongqiao Bureau "29" manual common battery telephone capacity 310 numbers</p>
<p>Jiangsu Bureau "2" manual common battery telephone capacity 4,100 numbers</p>
<p>West Bureau "3," "6," and "62" automatic telephone capacity 11,900 numbers</p>
<p>Also "62" semi-automatic telephone capacity 700 numbers</p>
<p>North Bureau "4" automatic telephone capacity 6,800 numbers</p>
<p>Huishan Bureau "5" automatic telephone capacity 3,300 numbers</p>
<p>Fenyang Bureau "7" automatic telephone capacity 9,900 numbers</p>
<p>Also "68" semi-automatic telephone capacity 1,000 numbers</p>
<p>Yunnan Bureau "8" automatic telephone capacity 8,600 numbers</p>
<p>Fujian Bureau "9" automatic telephone capacity 8,000 numbers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's telephone currently has about 4,000 users and eight branch offices. Its telephone numbers are arranged as follows:</p>
<p>City Center Bureau "5" automatic telephone capacity 600 numbers</p>
<p>Hongkou Bureau "6" automatic telephone capacity 2,600 numbers</p>
<p>Nanshi Bureau "7" automatic telephone capacity 1,000 numbers</p>
<p>Longhua Bureau "74" manual common battery telephone capacity 120 numbers</p>
<p>Pudong Bureau "75" manual common battery telephone capacity 300 numbers</p>
<p>Zhenru Bureau "64" manual magneto telephone capacity 50 numbers</p>
<p>Wusong Bureau "65" manual magneto telephone capacity 50 numbers</p>
<p>Fuxing Island Bureau "66" manual common battery telephone capacity 60 numbers</p>
<p>Due to the fundamental differences in the telephone systems of the two organizations, the cumbersome procedures for connecting lines between the two are unavoidable. The biggest shortcoming is that both use a five-digit system, and there are many identical user numbers between them. For example, the company's Fenyang Bureau has 70731, and the Telecommunications Bureau's Nanshi also has the same number. Assuming that special connection procedures are not used, users who dial 70731 from the company's Fenyang Bureau will inevitably be connected to Nanshi by mistake. Similarly, users who dial 62233, a semi-automatic telephone number of the company's West Bureau, will definitely be connected to Hongkou by mistake, causing a huge error. Furthermore, due to the different systems of the two parties, their machinery cannot be used interchangeably, and even the desire to make up for each other's shortcomings is not allowed by the facts, resulting in difficulties in supplying telephones.</p>
<p>2.  "02" and "Dial 0"</p>
<p>Due to the different procedures for telephones between the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, users cannot dial directly between them and must use special connection procedures, namely, the "02" connection and first dialing the "0" digit. This method involves installing an "02" connection station between the telephone company and the Telecommunications Bureau, with operators on duty to connect the lines. This station has 20 pairs of relay lines to the City Center Bureau, 80 pairs to the Hongkou, Wusong, Zhenru, and Fuxing Island Bureaus, and 70 pairs to the Nanshi, Longhua, and Pudong Bureaus. Telephone company users who dial "02" telephones are all connected through this exchange station. During busy times, if more than 80 people are simultaneously dialing the "6" digit telephone in Hongkou, they will hear an "engaged" tone. As for the Telecommunications Bureau connecting to the telephone company, there is no separate exchange station. Instead, the "0" digit is used in the automatic machine's vacant position, and a repeater is installed on the middle trunk line. The user simply dials the "0" digit, and the repeater directly sends its pulse electricity to the company's selector, providing the company's track surface for dialing. Therefore, "02" users who dial a company telephone must wait for two track surface sounds. Only after hearing the Telecommunications Bureau's track surface sound and dialing the "0" digit, and then hearing the company's track surface sound, can they dial the number to avoid errors. Currently, there are 100 trunk lines from Nanshi to the company, 125 from Hongkou, and 25 from the City Center. Under the current circumstances, this should meet the needs, but during busy business hours, it is still inevitable to encounter an engaged tone.</p>
<p>3.  Reasons for Engagement</p>
<p>Whenever we make a phone call, we hear the "buzzing" sound of an engaged line. When we need to connect to a telephone, hearing the engaged tone often causes emotional agitation. However, in a large metropolis like Shanghai, where there are already more than 60,000 telephone users, it is unavoidable to encounter an engaged line. Currently, there are as many as 17 large and small telephone bureaus in Shanghai. Between the bureaus, hundreds to thousands of pairs of relay lines are used to connect them. When a user dials the first number, except for those with the same first digit as their telephone number, they must first pass through this relay line to reach the telephone bureau of the called user, and then select the line. For example, if a user with the number 72382 wants to call 42333, after dialing the first digit "4," the pulse electricity will move the first group of selectors in the "7" digit position of the Fenyang Bureau, and then directly reach the second group of selectors in the "4" digit position of the North Bureau via the relay line, and then accept the dialing pulse electricity of 2333, eventually connecting to the called user. There are currently 600 pairs of these relay lines from the Fenyang Bureau to the North Bureau, and the two bureaus have a total of about 15,000 users — about 9,600 in the Fenyang Bureau and about 4,400 in the North Bureau. Communication between them must go through these 600 pairs back and forth. If more than 600 people are communicating at the same time, those who come later will hear an engaged tone. Currently, in the business districts of Shanghai, the relay lines between telephone bureaus such as the Central and Fujian Bureaus, the Central and Fourth Bureaus, and the Fujian and West Bureaus all have more than 1,000 pairs each. In residential districts, the relay lines between telephone bureaus such as the West Bureau and the Jiangsu Bureau, and the Jiangsu Bureau and the Fenyang Bureau also have 800 pairs each. However, as the number of users increases and the types of calls become more frequent, encountering an engaged line is almost unavoidable. Furthermore, communication between users often lasts a long time due to business negotiations, or there may be lingering love talk that does not end for a long time. Relay lines are occupied for a long time, making it impossible for later users to pass through the relay lines. This is another reason why people hear an engaged tone.</p>
<p>4.  Basic Rationalization and Improvement</p>
<p>The key to improving Shanghai's telephone system is to unify the system. The current two telephone systems in Shanghai — rotary and step-by-step — each have their advantages, but the rotary telephone system has a capacity of about 20 times that of the step-by-step system. In terms of the cost of improvement, it is more economical to switch to the rotary system. Looking at the future development of Shanghai, the relative importance of the urban area and the suburbs has not yet been determined, but to cope with the future progress of telephones, a system with elasticity must be adopted. Because the rotary system has the characteristic of Register-Translator, it is elastic. From a technical point of view, no matter how the future develops, the improvement plan can be carried out without being restricted after the city adopts the rotary automatic system, and there is no risk of wasting resources in terms of economy. Moreover, because the rotary system uses a register translator, it has a larger capacity, and the distribution of inter-bureau relay lines can also be economical. Especially for two bureaus that are far apart, the Tandem Trunking method can be used, without the need to set up direct relay lines that are very long and not busy. This type of relay method can reduce communication costs and provide high-quality and affordable services, allowing all citizens to enjoy the supply of telephones more. However, to implement this improvement plan, two points must first be adjusted:</p>
<p>Regulation of the block area of each bureau. Due to the fact that the telephone company monopolized the area of the former two concessions, the number of users in each bureau is not evenly distributed. The bureaus in the central area have small areas and dense users, requiring more mechanical keys. The suburban blocks are wide and sparsely populated, with few users and long lines. Moreover, the installation areas of each overlap. The distribution of lines is really unsuitable. Within the improvement plan, it is appropriate to regulate the rational business area of each bureau in the city to enable users to install machines and develop evenly.</p>
<p>Reform of telephone numbers. Currently, all Shanghai telephones use a five-digit system. Because the two organizations each have the same first digit, special connection procedures have to be adopted, causing many shortcomings. After the system is unified in the future, the "02" and "Dial 0" will be cancelled, and a six-digit dialing system must be adopted. Experts have researched the format and found that using six digits, with a dash between the first two digits and the last four digits, such as 21-1234, 73-1234, etc., can make it easier for users to remember. Currently, the improvement plan has been planned by technical personnel from both sides several times, but because mechanical equipment is not easy to purchase, and economic and financial resources must be planned in advance, it will take some time to see the results.</p>
<h3>How to Send News Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Diao Zhibing</p>
<p>I am a telecommunications worker and also a soldier working in the press. Therefore, among the thousands of telegrams I handle daily, including ordinary, urgent, express, social, night letters, and military, I naturally pay the most attention to news telegrams.</p>
<p>Shanghai's press is the most developed in the country, with numerous newspapers, plus special correspondents from out-of-town newspapers stationed in Shanghai and foreign journalists. The number of news telegrams sent out of Shanghai every day is very considerable. These telegrams are of good quality and quantity, and most of them are important and time-sensitive. Therefore, whenever I receive such a telegram, I always process them at high speed, hoping to catch up with the publication time of their newspapers, so as not to delay and lose their news value.</p>
<p>In my work over the past two months, most of the news telegrams I have handled have met the ideal requirements, making them very easy to process. It does not take an hour to transmit them to the other party. For example, it used to take three or four hours for a foreign language news telegram sent from Nanjing to Shanghai, but since August, it has been shortened to about one hour to arrive. And the processing time in Shanghai is less than 30 minutes, which shows the high efficiency of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau in processing news telegrams. However, a few have illegible handwriting, blurred codes, and too many additions, deletions, or corrections, causing difficulties in the work of receiving and sending telegrams, which affects their accuracy and causes unnecessary losses in time. It is a pity that we sometimes see "Telegram unclear" or "Special telegram not arrived" written in parentheses in the newspaper, or the publication time of the newspaper is delayed due to waiting for the telegram. To give another recent example, when General Wedemeyer arrived in Shanghai, a reporter stationed in Shanghai from a newspaper in another city interviewed and obtained important news that Wedemeyer would visit Madame Sun Yat-sen in the afternoon and meet with representatives of various parties and celebrities from the community. He wrote the telegram and sent someone to send it late at night, but he was too rushed when writing it, and he forgot to register the telegram. Moreover, the codes in the telegram were also extremely blurred, making it difficult to identify. After repeatedly inquiring and correcting, he wasted two hours, and as a result, he failed to catch up with the publication time of the newspaper. The news became history. An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, and the precious time of two hours is really difficult to calculate its value. A moment of haste and negligence caused an irreparable loss.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, I would like to make some important points to my friends in the press and ask them to cooperate and pay attention to improvement in order to save time, improve work efficiency, and eliminate this unnecessary and irreparable loss. This is not only convenient for others, but also convenient for yourself.</p>
<p>Please use the forms provided by this bureau or your own newspaper to write. Write the letters in small squares and translate the codes in large squares.</p>
<p>Please write clearly, and do not make corrections in the telegram to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>It is best to write with a pen or brush. A pencil is also acceptable, but it must be clear and easy to see, avoiding illegible handwriting.</p>
<p>It is best to translate the codes yourself. Otherwise, send them before midnight. After midnight, there is a shortage of manpower, and news telegrams are not as ordinary as ordinary telegrams. They are all long, with hundreds or thousands of words, and it takes too long to translate the codes, so they cannot be sent out in time.</p>
<p>The sender must hold the permit issued by the Telecommunications Administration Bureau for sending news telegrams for verification.</p>
<p>The newspaper seal and the reporter's signature and seal should be affixed to the telegram.</p>
<p>Because news telegrams inevitably make people think of general telegrams. Common mistakes in general telegrams are:</p>
<p>Writing the name of the place.</p>
<p>Forgetting to write the telegram registration number.</p>
<p>Writing the name and address of the sender.</p>
<p>Writing in a small square and translating codes in a large square.</p>
<p>There are words in the telegram that have not been translated into codes.</p>
<p>The telegram is illegible, and there are too many simplified characters.</p>
<p>We are currently engaged in a major telecommunications revolution to ensure that express telegrams do not take more than one and a half hours, urgent telegrams do not take more than four hours, and ordinary telegrams do not take more than eight hours to arrive. With our subjective efforts, the facts prove that we are already close to this standard. If everyone pays attention to the errors listed above and improves them objectively, then we will be able to shorten the time further, reduce errors, and achieve accuracy and speed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Telecommunications Plan</h3>
<p>In March 1946, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided on the Soviet Union's new five-year telecommunications plan (from 1946 to 1950). This plan includes: using the latest technology to restore and expand radio communications in areas that have been occupied by German troops. Building reliable telegraph and telephone communications between Moscow and various administrative centers and between the capitals of various republics and their administrative centers. Restoring and building 7,000 kilometers of major telegraph and telephone cables. Installing 55 radio telegraph and telephone transmitters, 20 of which will be suspended and established in central Soviet Union to strengthen communications in the Far East, Kazakhstan, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Expanding the automatic telephone equipment of various telecommunications bureaus. Adding 28 broadcasting stations. Restoring and transforming the Moscow television station and adding three television stations in Leningrad, Kiev, and Sverdlovsk. (Fan)</p>
<h3>"The Public" and "Telecommunications"</h3>
<p>— Li Jiqing</p>
<p>Telecommunications is a public utility. Therefore, all improvements in telecommunications facilities should be aimed at "the public." The various new methods implemented by the Telecommunications Bureau recently are completely aimed at making it more convenient and faster for "the public" to send telegrams and make telephone calls. On the contrary, what should the public's attitude towards the Telecommunications Bureau be? In our opinion, it should be as follows:</p>
<p>Frankly urge improvement The Telecommunications Bureau is currently striving to improve the handling of telegrams and telephone calls every day. However, due to various restrictions such as manpower, materials, and financial resources, there are still many areas where it cannot be done perfectly. In addition to the Telecommunications Bureau paying attention to and striving to improve at any time, it is also hoped that the public will provide as much supervision and guidance as possible. If there is anything wrong, please frankly inform the Telecommunications Bureau. The Telecommunications Bureau must sincerely accept such opinions or suggestions and try to implement them one by one.</p>
<p>Please make full use of telegrams and telephones The Telecommunications Bureau welcomes the public to make full use of and criticize the various equipment and new methods implemented for telegrams and telephones. The more the public uses them, the more the Telecommunications Bureau will "use their brains" and try to make the public enjoy more convenience. Currently, the fees for telegrams and telephones are still very cheap compared to general commodity prices. Sending a telegram or making a long-distance telephone call to relatives and friends in distant places will definitely achieve unexpected results!</p>
<p>"The Public" and "Telecommunications" are inseparable in modern life. We sincerely hope that "the public" will constantly supervise and guide "telecommunications" and make extensive use of them. The Telecommunications Bureau should naturally sincerely accept their guidance and criticism, and at all times try to actively improve telegrams and telephones and seek convenience and speed for them. This kind of mutual assistance is a good way to seek progress.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Telecommunications Lectures</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>Lecture 3: How to Choose Special Services</p>
<p>The standard service that a telegraph bureau provides to its customers is that the sending bureau (i.e., the telegraph bureau at the sender's location) dispatches telegrams according to the order in which they are received. The telegrams are then transmitted directly via a long-distance circuit or indirectly via an intermediate bureau (when there is no direct long-distance circuit between the sending and receiving bureaus, it may be necessary to pass through one or more intermediate bureaus for relay) to the receiving bureau (i.e., the telegraph bureau at the recipient's location). The receiving bureau then arranges the telegrams in the order they were received, adds any necessary corrections and transmits them via a courier along a set route to the recipient. The "special services" discussed here refer to situations where the customer is willing to pay a commensurate price to request the telegraph bureau to provide services beyond the standard service that are faster, more reliable, more thorough, and more convenient. Alternatively, the customer may wish to have the telegram transmitted and delivered before its place in the standard delivery order, or be willing to accept certain restrictions stipulated by the telegraph bureau in exchange for lower rates. By way of analogy to postal services, if we consider the postal service for regular mail as the standard service, then sending airmail or express mail would be a special service where the sender requests faster service. Registered mail and insured mail would be special services where the sender requests more thorough and reliable service. Issuing postal money orders and handling subscriptions to newspapers and magazines are special services provided by the post office to give senders more convenient service. Sending postcards and printed matter are special services where the sender is willing to accept restrictions on size or content in order to obtain reduced postage rates.</p>
<p>When sending mail, other than standard service regular mail, the sender must write words like "Airmail," "Express," "Single Registered," "Double Registered," "Printed Matter," etc., in the upper left corner of the envelope, or affix various small labels specially printed by the post office. Similarly, when a sender submits a telegram that falls outside the standard service ordinary telegram, or if the telegram is an ordinary telegram but the sender requests the telegraph bureau to provide more thorough, reliable, or convenient services than the standard service during transmission and delivery, a specific telegraph bureau identifier must be added to the beginning of the text (i.e., before the recipient's name and address). This identifier is called the paid service identifier, or simply the paid identifier.</p>
<p>In a letter, the sender can choose two or more special services of a non-conflicting nature simultaneously, such as "Airmail Express" or "Airmail Express Printed Matter," or airmail express letters with money orders attached. Similarly, in a telegram, if the sender deems it necessary, they can also choose two or more non-conflicting special services within the same telegram, such as "Reply Paid, Prepaid Reply Fee," "Reply Paid, Collation, Distribution," and so on.</p>
<p>Various special services applicable to domestic telegrams include those requesting faster service, such as express (identifier LTN) and urgent (identifier D), and those offering reduced rates, such as night letter (identifier NLT) and social telegram (identifier SLT). The purpose and effect of the above special services have already been briefly explained in the second lecture, so they will not be repeated here. Here, let us explain the various special services that provide more reliable, thorough, and convenient services, as follows: (To be continued in the third section)</p>
<h3>Heart of the Telegraph Communication Network: A Glimpse of the Central Office</h3>
<p>— Yu Angxiao</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's wireless transmitter is located at the Nanxiang Transmitting Station, and the receiver is at the Liuhang Receiving Station. Both locations are connected to the main business office on Fuzhou Road by cables. The "Central Office," a department situated between the two, is, as its name suggests, the "central control station" for telegraph communication, fully demonstrating its importance.</p>
<p>The Central Office is a purely technical organization responsible for communicating between the transmitting and receiving stations and the telegraph office on Fuzhou Road. It is responsible for maintaining and improving all the machines and equipment of the Fuzhou Road Bureau. Under the supervision of the chief engineer, wireless and wired engineers are in charge of their respective areas. The Central Office is further divided into the "Wireless Adjustment Room," "Wired Adjustment Room," "General Repair Shop," wireless and wired "Telegraph Office Repair Room," as well as the "Motor Generator Room," "Battery Room," and "Oil Engine Generator Room." It can be said that it is "integrated into zero," with division of labor and cooperation, covering all aspects.</p>
<p>The wired and wireless adjustment rooms can also be said to be the "terminal rooms" for wireless and wired telegraphs. They are the most important part of the Central Office's subordinate units. Their function is equivalent to the heart of a human body, serving as the distribution center for transmitting and receiving circuits. All wireless signals received from various locations by the Liuhang Receiving Station are first transmitted through cables to the switchboard in the Wireless Adjustment Room. After passing through the amplifier in the Adjustment Room, they are then connected to the recording machine in the telegraph office for the telegraph operators to record. Signals sent out from the communication desk are also first connected to the Adjustment Room, and then systematically connected to the transmitter at the transmitting station by the Adjustment Room. In addition to managing the carrier wave machine, the Wired Adjustment Room is naturally a world of "wires" with "thousands of strands," all under its control. Therefore, the technical staff on duty in the Adjustment Room appear to be in the role of "brokers." They must be responsible for notifying the "opening" or "closing" of the transmitting and receiving machines, adjusting the wavelength, adjusting the sound, testing the accuracy of the automatic mechanism in the telegraph office, testing the quality of circuits in various locations, and determining the location of any damage and how to deal with it. When the telephone is busy, the "brokers" are constantly talking and overwhelmed, with one or two people on duty, more tense than the stock exchange.</p>
<p>To prevent the circuits going to Nanxiang from being damaged, the Wireless Adjustment Room experimented with "remote control" using ultra-short waves this spring. The advantage of ultra-short waves is that they can "return fully loaded." A small ultra-short wave machine, attached to a carrier wave machine, is sufficient to replace more than a dozen remote control lines, and can simultaneously "air transport" many signals to the transmitter in Nanxiang. However, at the beginning of the experiment, in a Shanghai full of high-rise buildings, the design and installation of the "directional antenna" took a lot of effort, but now it has achieved remarkable success. Once a certain number of "Nanxiang lines" are damaged, simply turn on the ultra-short wave machine without panic. This is a great contribution to the efficiency of communication.</p>
<p>The General Repair Shop is simply a small factory: lathes, benches, and various other equipment are available. Malfunctioning parts, such as typewriters, perforating machines, and recording machines, are "treated" here. The Telegraph Office Repair Room is their "branch factory," with a constant stream of "broken things" being sent in and "good things" being sent out every day. As for the complicated wireless part, in addition to being handled by technical assistants at any time, engineers also personally step in to perform "miraculous recoveries."</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is the "soul" of the telegraph: power supply. We know that the Central Office has various machines that need electricity to maintain their activity, and their "appetite" for "eating electricity" varies. The Central Office has two places that regularly supply power: one is the Motor Generator Room, where the power company supplies 380 volts of "electric power," which is then "generated" by the electric motor into 110 volts of direct current for the automatic machines and perforating machines in the telegraph office, 180 volts of direct current for the telegraph keys, and 220 and 110 volts of alternating current for amplifiers, monitoring receivers, and recorders. The other is the Battery Room, which is dedicated to supplying the 130 volts of direct current required by the carrier wave machines in the Wired Adjustment Room. Every day, technical assistants pay attention to the dryness and temperature of the room, and the adjustment of the electrolyte level.</p>
<p>However, if the external power suddenly goes out, it would be a fatal blow to the Central Office. Therefore, the Central Office also has a "backup vehicle" in place: the standby oil engine generator room, which generates electricity using a diesel engine. If the power company cuts off power, we can also supply 380 volts of alternating current ourselves. We also conduct regular drills to avoid improvising at the last minute.</p>
<p>In short, since all the staff in the Central Office are machine operators, their work may not be as orderly as that of other departments, but some of them work hard, some work physically, some have to design huge projects, and some have to climb up and down all day, working with oily machines and tangled wires, burying themselves in hard work, but always playing the role of "backstage heroes." Not to mention if it lacks the Central Office—even if the Central Office occasionally suffers a heart weakness, the entire telegraph communication of Shanghai would be unimaginable.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on Grapes</h3>
<p>— Shufeng</p>
<p>The transplantation of grapes to China dates back to the second century BC. The Book of Han records: "The state of Dayuan governs the area around Guishan City, where grapes are used to make wine. Wealthy people store up to ten thousand dan of wine, and it can last for decades without spoiling. Zhang Qian first introduced [grape] seeds to Emperor Wu, who planted grapes extensively. Many grape arbors were built beside the emperor's detached palaces and official residences." This is clear evidence, and moreover, as soon as grapes were introduced, they were planted to the extent of "many grape arbors," which shows the general fondness for these vermilion, round grapes at the time. Emperor Wen of Wei even praised grapes as "sweet but not cloying, crisp but not sour, cool but not cold, with a long taste and abundant juice," which can be said to be the highest praise for this fragrant, intense, ambrosia-like fruit.</p>
<p>Chinese records of grapes all say that they are produced in the Western Regions. Most of the ancient Western Regions are now the area of Central Asia. Indeed, in that area, especially in the Amu Darya river basin in Central Asia, grapes grow wild naturally, and it is even possible to find vines as thick as two people can embrace, and grape clusters two feet long and weighing more than ten pounds. The Book of Tang also records: "Dashi [Arabia], originally Persian territory, presents noble grapes every year, the large ones being like chicken eggs." The Complete Treatise on Agriculture also says: "...Yunnan's are as large as...those from Persia, as large as chicken eggs." If the grapes are as large as chicken eggs, then naturally the vines must be large enough for two people to embrace. Compared to the medium-sized grapes from Hebei and Shandong that we can see, it is a huge difference.</p>
<p>Grapes also have another name called "Granted Purple Cherry." Xu Guangqi's Complete Treatise on Agriculture of the Ming Dynasty says, "...Grapes, also known as Granted Purple Cherry. The Guang Zhi says: There are three kinds, yellow, white, and black; Crystal grapes have a white halo like powder, are large and long, and taste sweet; Purple grapes are black, and there are two kinds, large and small, with both sour and sweet tastes; Green grapes come from Shu [Sichuan]; the color is green when ripe, but the green grapes of the Western Regions called Rabbit's Eye, which taste better than sugar and honey and have no seeds, are different." But in addition to these names distinguished by color, there are also many unique names based on quality, such as Ouyu, Grass Dragon Pearl, Grandfather Leads Grandson, Rose Fragrance, and Mare's Teat Grapes. In addition, there is a kind of Suo Suo grapes produced in Tubo [Tibet], which are as small as peppercorns, contrasting with the egg-shaped grapes, which is a different kind of grape. The Complete Treatise on Agriculture also has a record of "Suo Suo Grapes," saying: "Suo Suo grapes are often eaten by children, which can prevent smallpox. It is also said that if the smallpox is not progressing well, eating them will bring it out." Unexpectedly, such a delicious fruit also has this medicinal effect.</p>
<p>As for the method of picking grapes to make raisins, in the past, people in the Shanxi area used to tie a bunch of fresh grapes with a rope and hang them in a dry, airtight house, and then light a ground fire stove in the house, so that the fresh grapes would gradually dry out. After about twenty days of baking, they could be taken down and stored. About four pounds of fresh grapes can be baked into one pound of raisins. The Essential Skills for the Common People also records a method of making grapes, saying: "Pick the extremely ripe ones one by one, cutting off the stems with a knife, being careful not to let the juice come out...boil them four or five times, strain them out and dry them in the shade, and they will be done. The taste is twice as good, and they will not spoil in the summer." This is another method of boiling.</p>
<p>Although grapes originated in Central Asia, Europe produces more than Asia. France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain are all countries that produce large quantities of grapes and wine. In Portugal alone, the vineyards occupy 35% of the country's area, meaning Portugal alone has 30,000 square kilometers of land that can produce grapes, equivalent to 33 and a half Shanghais. The amount of production can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Deep Impressions</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guangyu</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in Qingdao, I went to visit an exhibition at the Sacred Heart Girls' Middle School, which was run by the church. On display there were exquisitely made clothes, trousers, and pillows, mouth-watering cakes and pastries, as well as calligraphy and paintings of various sizes and documents. As I left one exhibition room to step into another, I heard the sound of a piano coming from the next room. At that moment, an American teacher was sitting in the corridor. When she heard the sound, she immediately stood up solemnly. A minute later, she sat down again with a smile. I thought that the melody of the piano was probably very similar to the American national anthem, so when she heard it, she unconsciously stood up, and only when she listened carefully and found that it was not the national anthem did she sit down with a smile. I don't know if other visitors saw this scene and how they felt about it, but it gave me a deep impression.</p>
<p>Also ten years ago, also in Qingdao, I went to Zhongshan Park to see the cherry blossoms. As I looked at the trees one by one, I unconsciously approached the so-called "Monument to Loyal Souls." It was built by the Japanese to commemorate the soldiers who died when they seized Qingdao from the Germans. I was not very interested in this place, so I rarely came here. This time, lured by the cherry blossoms, I actually came, so I glanced at it. I saw only one young child in Japanese attire in front of the "Monument to Loyal Souls." I call him a young child because he looked no more than five or six years old. He may have been a kindergarten student, or maybe he hadn't even started school yet, but he was here alone. Did he run here from home by himself, or did he come here with his parents to see the cherry blossoms and then take the time to come here? I didn't know at all. I only saw him standing solemnly and bowing piously. There was no training director by his side, nor any parents, siblings, or relatives. He was paying his respects alone. I don't know if other visitors saw this scene and how they felt about it, but it gave me a deep impression.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Emperor Jianwen's Abdication</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lixing</p>
<p>Emperor Jianwen reigned for only four years before being forced to abdicate and flee by the Prince of Yan, who possessed a large army. From then on, this emperor of a generation donned a cassock and lived a life of retreat in the southwest, spending his days with the sound of morning bells and evening drums.</p>
<p>After the Prince of Yan changed the era name and ascended the throne, he superficially issued decrees to strictly search for and arrest the abdicated and fleeing emperor, Emperor Jianwen, but in reality, this was all a measure to stir up the grass and startle the snake. If he were to actually arrest Emperor Jianwen, the Prince of Yan would find it difficult to deal with him. Kill him? He had seized the throne from someone else, and the fault lay with himself. What reason would he have to kill him? His conscience would not allow it, and it would be difficult to account for this case in history. Keep him? There was no second Ming Dynasty to place him in. A country cannot accommodate two rulers. How could they share the court? There was simply no way to keep him. Release him? Why capture him and then release him? It would be better not to capture him at all. Moreover, all the forces that Emperor Jianwen could employ had long been wiped out, leaving only a few followers, a group of insignificant officials who were not worth planning with. He simply didn't pay them any attention. Therefore, he deliberately let go of the indecisive Emperor Jianwen, who was powerless and harmless, and was confident that Emperor Jianwen had no power to take back the throne from him. Therefore, he did not uproot the tree after it had fallen, but instead relaxed and did not pursue the matter. I heave a sigh of relief for Emperor Jianwen. If the Prince of Yan had not planned this way at the time, he would never have escaped his clutches.</p>
<p>Since the imperial court did not insist on getting to the bottom of the matter, why would the officials need to add insult to injury? Moreover, there was justice in this matter, so why add another stroke to history: "On such and such a date, so and so captured the former Emperor Jianwen and presented him to the court." Therefore, Emperor Jianwen was able to travel freely in the southwest for thirty-nine years, and it was not without these reasons that he was able to live a carefree life.</p>
<p>During his twenty-nine years of secluded life, Emperor Jianwen visited many famous mountains and scenic spots. Because he loved to compose poetry, he would write poems whenever he climbed to a high place. Please see the following poems: When climbing Mount Emei, he wrote: "Climbing high, there is no need to crane my neck eastward, for I only see the clouds flying from my homeland." When climbing Zhangtai and mourning the past, he wrote: "Where are the songs of Chu and the dances of Zhao now? I only see the crows circling the trees, crying in the cold." And in his sentimental poem, he wrote: "Wasted in the southwest for forty autumns, my white hair is already full of my head. Heaven and earth are limited, where is my home? The Yangtze and Han rivers are heartless, their waters flowing on their own. In the Palace of Everlasting Life, the immortal energy has dissipated, and on the Chaoyuan Pavilion, the sound of rain is heard. New reeds and slender willows sprout every year, and the old villagers swallow their voices and weep endlessly!" And another poem scattered in various places: "Overnight, the wind and rain suddenly invaded, and the mandate of heaven shifted silently in the hearts of the four seas. The phoenix returned to Dan Mountain, and the red sun was far away. The dragon returned to the Canghai Sea, and the azure clouds were deep. In the Purple Palace, the stars still provide their images, and the jade clepsydra silently drips water. I imagine the moon over the Forbidden City tonight, and the six palaces still hope for your arrival." Another poem: "After reading the Surangama Sutra, I lean on the alms bowl and laugh at the thatched hut, a humble dwelling place. Traveling south, I crossed thousands of layers of misty mountains, and looking north, I gazed at the gates of heaven, ten thousand miles away. I have long forgotten the flying phoenix carriage, and I have exchanged the dragon robe for a cassock. Where do the hundred officials know where they are today? Only the archipelago offers morning and evening tribute." It is truly filled with grief and sorrow, which cannot but make people sigh deeply upon reading! An emperor of a generation! A poet of a generation!</p>
<h3>The Value of Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>— Heting</p>
<p>On the eve of National Day, the Tsinghua Alumni Association held a farewell party for a friend who was going to study in the United States. During the banquet, many familiar friends discussed the value of studying abroad. Some raised the argument that studying abroad is a waste, while others expressed regret over studying abroad. Everyone was filled with many emotions!</p>
<p>There are roughly two reasons for opposing studying abroad: the first is what Mr. Hu Shih said, "a waste of foreign exchange." This is his opinion from an economic point of view, but the value of studying abroad is multifaceted, including increasing personal knowledge, promoting national spirit, communicating international culture, and promoting world cooperation. We cannot abandon it simply because of an economic reason.</p>
<p>The second reason is more easily believed, saying that studying abroad often leads to a disconnect from the reality of domestic society. Therefore, since the late Qing Dynasty sent students to study abroad, there have been no achievements to speak of. In fact, the inability of society to improve is a problem of the entire country and cannot be entirely blamed on students studying abroad. There are also students studying abroad who abandon themselves, such as a group of "foreign adults" in the late Qing Dynasty and corrupt officials in various institutions, but these cannot affect the value of studying abroad itself. Studying abroad is like running a university. Although there are many scoundrels and unfavorable phenomena in the university, we do not abolish the university for this reason. In all fairness, there are indeed many students studying abroad who serve the country, and today, those who shoulder the responsibility of national construction are mostly people who have studied abroad. The followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the National Revolution were all mainly students studying abroad. The Qing Dynasty's dispatch of students to study abroad had unexpected results. This can also serve as clear evidence of the multifaceted value of studying abroad.</p>
<p>From the perspective of education itself, the policy of studying abroad is only a means to achieve the goal of "academic independence." Adopting the advantages of others and enriching our own abilities is also in line with our country's spirit of "emulating the virtuous." Although inviting a few foreign scholars to give lectures in China can also develop effects, academic research is not just a matter of oral transmission. There are also various conditions of academic research atmosphere and social background, which cannot be achieved overnight. Looking further ahead, in the Han and Tang Dynasties, countries in the East and West sent students to study in China. This year, European countries also have exchange students with Chinese universities. Each country has its own cultural strengths, and academic exchange also has a moral responsibility. Our country's long-standing moral spirit is precisely what modern human peace needs. At that time, students from all over the world will come to China to study abroad, and we cannot regard earning foreign exchange as the goal of research. Therefore, the main question is how to improve the policy of studying abroad as soon as possible? Such as improving the academic level of students studying abroad, providing guidance for students studying abroad, facilitating the return of students studying abroad to serve the country, and making it possible for students studying abroad to develop their ambitions as much as possible. This is the work that is worth discussing today and that the government should implement quickly.</p>
<p>The world's culture is merging century by century. In today's international relations, which have not yet broken away from hostility, sending students to study abroad has a more active significance. For the sake of the entire world's culture and human peace, we should send more students to study abroad!</p>
<p>Note: Postal communication between China and Japan has long been restored. The Post Office has sent a letter to correct this.</p>
<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Jituantuan</p>
<p>Dancing Training of Miss America</p>
<p>Americans do not regard dancing as a form of entertainment, but as a form of etiquette and fitness. Because there are basically no professional dancers or women who make a living by ballroom dancing in the United States, dancing is not an extravagant and frivolous behavior in Europe and the United States, but a legitimate activity. This is a matter of opinion. If interpreted by someone with malicious intentions, they can attribute all the evils of society to dancers. In fact, dancers are a product of China's deformed society. If the Chinese government and the public advocate dancing, and everyone, regardless of age or gender, can dance, then the mystery of dancing and the attractiveness of dancers will naturally disappear. Who would still be captivated?</p>
<p>American women start practicing dance steps in dance schools from a young age, not to prepare for a future career as a dance hostess, but to exercise their bodies, develop curves, and beautiful legs. Where does the beauty of American women lie? In their legs, in their curves. This kind of beauty is not innate, but cultivated through exercise. Without hard work, one will never have a healthy and beautiful physique. Eastern women do not emphasize fitness. Women with bound feet and Lin Daiyu types are representative figures of Chinese women. In recent years, with the popularity of dancing, women have had the opportunity to develop, but they can never catch up with the well-proportioned bodies of Miss America.</p>
<p>American dance schools are generally very large in scale, with strict teaching methods that do not contain frivolous or sloppy elements. They charge four US dollars per hour, calculated from half an hour, and charge for each lesson, calculating the time accurately. Teaching is extremely serious. The schools have large dance floors with large glass mirrors on all sides. Stepping in front of the mirror helps correct posture. In addition to ballroom dancing, there are special classes teaching stage performance dance. This kind of dance requires four or five years of hard work to hope for success. The key points are the toes, waist, and legs. They practice diligently for three or four hours every day. After four or five years, they naturally become as light as a swallow, exhibiting utmost beauty, and then they can perform on stage. Dancing is an integral part of the daily life of American women. One cannot be considered a modern woman without knowing how to dance. The liberal arts colleges in universities have special dance departments. Upon completion of the course, they are awarded bachelor's, master's, and even doctoral degrees in dance. The academic world attaches great importance to dancing. When this art arrives in China, it is exploited as a tool for profit, thus arousing protests from stubborn elements who want to ban dancing (or perhaps ban commercial dance halls). This is a case of "throwing out the baby with the bathwater." The only good way to prevent dancing from being used for profit is to promote dancing, popularize it, and make it affordable, so that dance halls have no business and dancers have no patrons. Imagine, if everyone can take their girlfriends to the park to dance, who would still want to run into a dance hall?</p>
<p>Weekly Film Review</p>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<h3>### Vulgar Adaptation of "Spring Dreams Broken"</h3>
<p>"Spring Dreams Broken," adapted from Turgenev's "A Nest of Gentlefolk," is clearly not in the same league as the original work. Because the story as it is now adapted is both vulgar and devoid of people's sympathy. As a tragedy, the protagonist lacks noble sentiments. The heroine, Li Lisha, relies solely on a little emotion from her childhood, and her love for Xian Zhuangyou is still blind. Love like that in the story, lacking a foundation and without common ideals, is merely a bubble of youthful passion. The character of Xian Zhuangyou is even more selfish and cruel, with nothing to love. Yet the playwright insists on creating this love tragedy, his intention being to earn the audience's tears. However, the playwright fundamentally does not understand the social causes that constitute a tragedy, and therefore can only write such a superficial story as it is now.</p>
<p>Because the content of the script determines the form of the performance, the director only pieced together a so-called tragic film in a disjointed manner. Among the actors, Liu Qiong is the worst. He always has the same old mannerisms. Li Hua performed somewhat better, while Shen Yang's musician was stiff and unnatural. Yu Ling's grandmother was quite good. Qiao Qi's Hong Jiaqi was the best actor in the entire film.</p>
<h3>### "The False Woman" Is Utterly Worthless</h3>
<p>"The False Woman" is another work adapted from a foreign piece. The story is Balzac's "A Woman of Thirty." However, our playwright does not care whether the story is suitable for our national conditions, and simply moves it to our land based on the bizarre and tortuous plot. As a result, everything becomes a fictional story created by the playwright, far removed from reality. The absurd male protagonist, Fan Yalun, is written as a war hero, which is even more inappropriate. In short, this is a film that relies on gimmicks and is utterly worthless.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin's directorial technique can only manage to move the story and narrate it flatly, while also being full of loopholes. Among the actors, Gu Lanjun worked very hard, but without brilliance. Yan Hua was not excessive this time, and was indeed better than before.</p>
<h3>### "Bitter Love" Is a Pieced-Together Story</h3>
<p>The films of "Da Zhonghua" are generally of lower quality among domestic films, and this "Bitter Love" is no exception. The story itself is pieced together. The elopement of the heroine, Mei Mei, with Lu Sha, is in itself an absurd act. The love between their next generation, Haiyan and Lu Xuecheng, is nothing more than a copy of the old story in "Thunderstorm." In short, this script is plagiarized from Western films and stage plays, a clumsy "hotchpotch."</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Yi Qiuxia was quite able to grasp the character's personality, steady and experienced. Chen Juanjuan was also competent. Lu Yukun's two roles did not achieve better results.</p>
<p>The director of this film is entirely in the "Hong Kong style," sloppy and perfunctory.</p>
<h3>### The Humorous Fantasy Film "Too Empty and Illusory"</h3>
<p>The British have a consistent sense of humor and wit. This "Too Empty and Illusory" is a film depicting the human world and the dog days, and the author cleverly uses a hallucination caused by a brain injury of an air force pilot. The story develops on two sides simultaneously, and is written in a compact and interesting way. In terms of production, "human interrogation" uses five colors, and "heaven" uses a simple gray, which is very appropriate and indeed ingenious.</p>
<p>David Niven's Peter, the heroine Gantingde's Joan, and Roger Livesey's doctor all have quite excellent results.</p>

<h3>Seeking Information on the Mystery Ship Involved in a Maritime Accident</h3>
<p>North of Banyao Reef Lighthouse on the Night of September 14th</p>
<p>Dear Editor: My poor fishermen's fishing boats were destroyed by a steamship, and fishermen were injured and killed, resulting in heavy losses. I hope to know the name of the ship. I especially request your newspaper to disclose the letter, and I will be eternally grateful!</p>
<p>We fishermen of Qushan, Dinghai, make a living by fishing. On the 28th day of the seventh lunar month, we launched fishing boats to fish on the sea about twenty miles north of the Banyao Reef (Xiaobaijiao) Lighthouse, hoping for a bountiful autumn catch. Who would have expected such an unexpected disaster? On the evening of September 14th (the 30th day of the seventh lunar month), around 10 pm, the tide was rising strongly. A crew member was working outside when he suddenly saw a steamship rushing towards them. He shouted urgently, "The steamship is going to collide!" The ship broke my fishing boat into two pieces, and crew members Zhou Pinde and Li Liangen were killed instantly. The ship also carried away the planks of another fishing boat. Amidst loud cries for help, the steamship went towards Shanghai.</p>
<p>At that time, another exporting steamship passed by the lighthouse, and perhaps it saw this tragedy. That night was as dark as pitch, and the surviving crew members were only concerned with escaping, so they did not clearly record the name and shape of the ship that caused the accident. Now I want to find a way to negotiate with the ship and seek guidance from the public after its disclosure. If there are any kind-hearted gentlemen who know the details, please inform me of the name of the ship involved in the accident, etc. Please send the letter to the Mao residence, No. 1, Lane 39, Chongqing South Road, Shanghai. I have always admired your newspaper's service to society and sympathy for the common people. Therefore, I venture to request that this letter be published, which is what I hope for. Sincerely, Hong Pinpin, a fisherman from Hengshan, Dinghai County, to the editorial department of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Hui's classification method is slightly Wuchang, published by Wenhua Bookstore, written by Pi Gaopin, Chinese decimal classification method, correspondence address: Bai Zheng, No. 6, Songtong Lane, East Jihama Road, North Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Job Seeking and Room Letting: The reader has been unemployed for quite some time, and I am deeply grateful for the corner of space used in the service column! "Now there is a Western-style building with a floor in the West Shanghai area, with full water and electricity, facing south. If you can introduce a driver or other job seeker, it can be rented out unconditionally. For those who are sincere, please send a letter to Zhou Zhang, No. 123, Fengyang Road. Ningbo native, 30 years old, has worked as a cashier in the banking industry, skilled in driving, has a license, and can provide a guarantor."</p>
