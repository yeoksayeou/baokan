<p>〔本報北平四日電〕華北入春亢旱，北方農產已面臨嚴重危機。北平棉產改進處長馮澤芳稱：本年北方各省普遍亢旱，尤以三四五月播種期為甚，北平四月份無雨，五月份一二點公釐，滬南五月廿八日晚僅降雨一九點八公釐，今後如再降雨，亦無大用，因農時已誤，小麥已臨收獲時期，棉苗已多枯乾。馮氏頻視窗外萬里無雪之天空，告記者謂本年旱象為卅餘年來所未有，僅民國三年可與比擬，不僅棉田受嚴重影響，其他農作物在生長期亦均受影響，今年農產量實可慮。</p>
<h3>全國經委會下週開會　研討征收財產稅　對平衡預算亦將決定具體辦法　卅五萬噸洋米陸續運來</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕征收財產稅，勢在必行，全國經委會十日開會時，對此將作具體研討，並可能有所決定。聞政府中有一部份人士主張，由各地民意機構開具豪門名單，以作開徵對象，然此事技術上恐有若干困難。又聞將來財產稅將採一次財產稅辦法，並採累進制，財產愈多者，所納者亦愈多。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕全國經委會上次會議中，曾決定對於經濟緊急措施方案中所訂平衡預算事項，推定委員分成五組，（一）軍費，（二）糧食，（三）財政，（四）國營事業及敵僞產業之出售，（五）一般機關經費之縮減，詳細研究開源節流辦法，據悉：第一組已於三日舉行會議，并提出報告，第五組定六日舉行會議，其他三組亦將於本週內舉行，將綜合小組意見，在十日舉行之會議中提出討論，以決定有效政策及具體辦法。又全國經委會根據組織條例第八條，該會因事實上必要，得設特種委會之規定，將設一物資委員會，其工作包括糧食，燃料供應日用必需品配售，美在華剩餘物資分配及美對華五億貸款物資部份處理詳細辦法，正由張羣與各主要負責人商討中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕政府對解決食米問題，已有具體把握，自本月份起，將有洋米卅五萬噸陸續運來中國，預計四個月可運畢。據估計，至少可解決沿海各都市六百萬人一年之需，此卅五萬噸洋米，其中五萬噸係南洋各地運來者，其餘卅萬噸，則係美國撥援華款項所採購。洋米運到後，將來京·滬等地普遍配售予公敎人員，軍人及勞工，使彼等不致受糧價壓迫，各地米價亦可因而平抑。美國救濟款項所購之洋米配售後，得價將用充救濟基金。又當局為防止因大批洋米運到，米價慘跌，影響農民計，將來不致採取在市場大量配售辦法。</p>

<p>緣民國三十六年二月間，至物價波動劇烈，影響民生，至為重大，監察院令派監察委員何漢文谷鳳翔張慶楨萬燦等會同澈查中央銀行於執行買賣黃金業務，有無措施失當及其他精神，調查結果，認為中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，襄理兼出納主任王松濤等，有下列違法失職之行為，（一）中央銀行之存金底數，關係國家機關，尤於黃金政策實施之前途有重大影響，乃該行總裁貝祖詒等，竟以全部出售金塊，交同豐餘金號一家負責分配與大豐恒等七家熔化金條，而不交中央造幣熔化，是央行全部售金之熔化數量，已同豐餘洞悉，又央行所有指定五家行號配售之黃金，均須經同豐餘金號主持人詹連生一人蓋章方能領取，是以中央銀行售出黃金總數量，使詹運生全部洞悉，自不難據此總數，以推悉央行存金之多寡，而伺機與黃金政策作投機之決鬥，以獲取鉅利，該貝詒等實有意洩　此項機密之嫌疑。（二）央行出售黃金，指定由同樣豐餘等五家行號負責，每日金價之決定，以五家與央行對講電話報告為凖，而五家行號之指定，係由貝祖詒，林鳳苞，楊安仁三人任意決定，漫無標準，益以此五家均係詹運生一人介紹，顯然故任詹蓮生把持操縱，謂為官商勾結，實非過分。（三）央行暗售金條，分配五家行號任其自由處分，而此項暗售方略，非政府所決定，當為貝林楊三人擅定之辦法。（四）查閱五家配售黃金行號之出售金條數目，列有中央銀行同人購買之黃金數十筆，計百餘條，甚至管理黃金勯存之　理王松濤亦購進金條，該貝祖詒漫加以約束，實有縱使部屬，染指黃金投機買賣之嫌疑。（五）在本年一月初以來，金價逐步上升，黃金政策已不能支持之先，該貝祖詒等自　據實呈報，另籌善法，乃延至二月十日突然宣布黃金停止配售，致金價暴漲，無法拾，並諉卸停售責任，實屬不法已極。根據上列事實，提案彈劾，請將中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，業務局長林鳳苞，副局長楊安仁，襄理王松濤一併移付懲戒，經監察委員金毓　王子弦于樹德審查成立，由監察院呈奉國民政府發交到會。</p>
<p>理由</p>
<p>本案被付懲戒人林鳳苞，楊家仁部份，經本會秘書處函准上海地方法院函復，林鳳苞，楊安仁已因貪污案由淞滬警備司令部移送本院，現正在審理中，其起訴事實與彈劾案記載之事實大致相同等由，依法不得開始懲戒程序，茲就被付懲戒人貝祖詒，王松濤部份，分別審究如左：（下文轉入二版）</p>
<h3>新聞局電各地治安當局保障新聞記者安全　董局長在招待會上答詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕各地新聞從業員近頗有被捕者，四日新聞局舉行記者招待會時，有人詢董顯光，新聞局對此有何意見？董氏答，兩日前新聞局已電各地治安軍警當局，請保障記者自由與安全，待學潮平息後，當再與地方當局磋商。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕新聞局四日下午四時半舉行記者招待會，由局長董顯光親自主持，茲誌董氏答覆記者各項詢問如下：</p>
<p>問，日前盛傳六月二日之罷課，罷工，政府對此何以特別重視事前防止上述運動之措置，是否為事實所必要？</p>
<p>答，據政府事前所得各方面情報，六月二日全國各大都市將發動一種組織嚴密，用意險惡之罷課罷工示威運動，目的在造成紛擾，藉此而發展成流血暴亂，政府對此自有採取緊急防止措施之必要。</p>
<p>學生及時警覺六二安然度過</p>
<p>此次危機之得以避免，主要因素有三：（一）全國學生能深明大義及時警覺；（二）各校當局以及參政會，立法院與其他民意機關，居間勸導，頗收挽救之功；（三）各地當局採取緊急行動，搜捕共黨份子，以及其他自動或盲從參加活動者。</p>
<p>問，或謂六月二日示威運動之計劃，係共黨在幕後策動，董局長對此有何意見？</p>
<p>答，共黨陰謀在思想紛雜及經濟困難之處最易活動，凡飽經長期戰爭摧殘之國家，皆有此共同之經騐，故最近之學生運動，迅即為共黨所利用，作為擾亂公安及危害政府之工具，諸君當必憶及六月二日為中共去年在延安發動所謂「反內戰運動」之日。</p>
<p>問，各地當局逮捕所謂共黨份子之政策，事前經行政院之許可否，被捕之學生及記者將公開審訊否？政府是否同意將所捕共黨份子送返共區之辦法？</p>
<p>答，和談破裂之後，政府明令所有共黨人員，於五月五日之前，歸返共區，故各地當局之搜捕共黨份子，事前無需再行請示行政院，凡實施戒嚴法之城市所捕學生及記者，得由當地軍事當局審詢之。</p>
<p>問，因最近數週之活動而被捕之全國學生共有若干？被捕之新聞記者或報館編輯共有若干？</p>
<p>答，若干城市因最近學生等示威行動而發生拘捕情事，捕後有加以扣留者，亦有迅即釋放者，故尙乏確數可告；上海拘捕之共黨份子及與共黨一致行動份子約八十名，其中有學生及記者，漢口曾扣押學生廿餘名，經審詢後均已釋放。</p>
<p>問，最近騷動中死亡之學生究有若干，且在何地死亡，亦請見告？</p>
<p>答，除漢口三學生外，其他各地均無死亡。</p>
<p>問，上週以來，實施戒嚴法之中國城市，能列舉其名稱否？</p>
<p>答，上海自卅四年十一月經國府宣告戒嚴後，尙未宣告解嚴，根據戒嚴法第三條之規定，接近戰事區域之城市或地區，當公共治安遭受威脅之際，當地最高軍事司令官得隨時宣佈戒嚴，如最近北平，天津宣佈戒嚴即其一例，共黨人員雖於四月五日自京滬渝等地撤退，但其地下工作人員並未同時撤離，近在各處陰謀暴動，政府獲得證據，故不能不加以搜查拘留，以便遣送中共區。</p>
<p>美方剩餘物資可望陸續運情</p>
<p>問，目前美國剩餘物資之運華情形若何？</p>
<p>答，到現在為止，中國政府所收到之剩餘物資約值二千萬美元，其中以卡車為主，關于美國剩餘物資轉讓中國一事，係根據卅五年八月宋前院長與美方所訂合同，美國政府同意以價值五億美元以上之物資，于簽約日起廿個月內，運交中國政府；然因運輸工具之缺乏，迄今美方所交到者，僅總額之一小部份而已。本年七月起美方負責此事之國外清理委會，即將開始結束，故中國政府極盼此項轉讓之物資，能陸續運到。我物資供應局近已與若干美國輪船公司簽訂合同，由各船公司將物資自　島·沖繩島及馬利安納等島運送來華。又此項儲存各島之物資，頃正由中美雙方聯合看管。</p>
<p>問，參政會此次大會中通過之和平提案甚多，政府對於此種和平運動前途樂觀否？</p>
<p>答，蔣主席，張院長在過去一週中曾數次提及政府對於和平之願望，惟和平係雙方面的，非一方面所能達到；現和平與不和平完全繫於中共，當參政會在發動和平運動之時，共黨竟在各地發動戰亂，此即可認為中共對和平運動之答覆。</p>
<p>問，六月二日京市有學聯會反暴動反罷課之遊行，依據維持社會秩序臨時辦法，十人以上遊行應加阻止，惟學聯會之遊行並未受阻，官方對此情事作何解釋？</p>
<p>答，據本人所知，是日有少數人員作小組宣傳，並未遊行，亦未示威，故政府未加制止。</p>
<p>問，報載天津已恢復新聞檢查，是否受有新聞局之命令？</p>
<p>答，新聞局未頒命令，新聞局亦未得關於此事之正式報告。</p>
<p>問，參政會此次大會曾決議征借國人在外存款，其征借辦法政府有無擬定？</p>
<p>答，尙在主管機關研究中。</p>

<h3>四強代表視察　準備分配之日艦</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京四日電〕中美英蘇四強代表，定明視察日本驅逐艦，及驅逐護航艦一艘，此二艘軍艦係分配予四強之九十艘日本海軍雙之典型，四強各將獲得廿三艘，內中六艘為驅逐艦，十七艘為護航艦，其分配將採抽　辦法，日期由盟總宣佈。</p>
<h3>暹羅國對日和約　美主早日締結　籌挖的　將在華府召開</h3>
<p>〔聨使社華頓三日電〕政府當局今日聲稱：對日和約籌備公議如經召開，地點恐將在華府。已往提及之可能會址有舊金山與檀香山等地。美國官方雖主張早日締結對日和約，但認為在明年底以前不致簽訂。若干人士鑒於英國召籌各自治領會議，討論對日和約政策一舉，均感早日革擬對日和約運動已彌漫於各盟國間</p>
<p>〔使眾社東京四日電〕據記者自此間最高方面獲悉：盟國對日和會將在今年年底前召開，以及和約在一九四八年初簽署之希望，現已與日俱增。由於美國國內最近情形之發展，有力量之與論機關，傾向於擢護麥克阿瑟之立塲，主張遭日締結和約，並繼之以將盟國佔領軍撤退。此間認為此乃最可領人鼓舞者。對於胡佛之建議，即不論歐洲形勢如何，立即日本締結和約，尤受此間歡迎，認為胡佛此種意見，足以正確反映遠東方面之實際情勢。根據記者所得情報，對日和約，並無重大困難之處，因實際上並無特別複雜尚未加以解決之問題存在也。波茨坦宣言，業規定日本戰後之國境，限制前日本本土之內，即本州，北海道，四國九州，以及可能包括鄰近之各小島。此一宣言本身，寶包括將來應列於條約中之廣汎條款在在內，如遵守其精神與規定，則締造和約者之工作，就某本問題言之，實十分容易也。就本體上言之，此間人士預料蘇聯將繼續保留千島列島，及南庫頁島之統轄，此根據雅遙達協定，允許割讓於蘇聯者也。美國將保留控制琉球羣島（包括沖繩島在內）之權利，此將為美國未來太平洋極西部之主要美國苝地。包括澳洲在內之不列顚聯邦共和國，雖渠等對於條款之意見，與美國太異其趣，然衆信渠等極盼對日和約能早日締結，衆料行將召開之康培拉會議中，不列顚市國之態度將加以正式決定，對此即將有所表示。又此間人士鄭重指出；美國方面對中蘇及其他盟國所已微集得之賠款數字，估計其價達四百億美元，其中包括蘇聯自東北湖（包括臺灣）之日本財產。此問人士認為和會在東就開，仍極有希望，因主要盟國之授權賠款代表團早已抵此，而同時有經騐豐富之人員及充分檔案，足供每一想及問題之參考。</p>
<p>〔又電〕新任日本藏相黨田均吿本社記者稱：「迅速召開和會訂立和約，對日本殊為重要。晶本希望和會能儘速召開，蓋不訂和約即日本復興主要之障礙也。日本人亦願賠償應付之賠款，然希望盟國能了爭維持最額外生存水準之企業。」</p>
<p>王正廷談話</p>
<h3>盟國應長期管束日本　至消滅侵略意念為止</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕我國外交名宿王正廷氏，昨就日本重復顯露其對臺變琉球之野心一事，發表感想，力主各盟國應予日本長期管束，以迄日本人民之侵略念，完全消滅為止。渠稱：臺灣琉球，自古以來，即為中國之領土，故日本之要求，極不合理，無論其要求能否實現，我國必須密切注意其發展，並作充份之防備。渠認為我國安全最有力之保障，。厥為發奮自強，我國國內呈現混亂不安之局面，以致錯過時機，最可痛惜。</p>

<p>董文琦談東北水利</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕董文掎昨（四日）搭十一時夜快車晉京，出席全國水利會議，約鋰日簽返滬，轉赴東北。據董氏對記者稱：以東北水　而言，當前有兩項急務：一為繞陽河之工程，在日人手中，已完　十分之七，惟兩年以來，損毀　多，故防災失兒，去年水發時，沿江八縣，損失國幣在五十億元以上。故此項工程，今年必須完工。此次赴就時，當與水利部及行　洽商一切，取得經費及物資之補助。其次為東遼河之水利工程，僞滿時代已完成十分之八，堤已築成，此項工程全部開成後，將使廣達三十萬畝之荒地成為良田，生年可產米六萬七千噸及小麥三萬六毛豆噸，此次將乘全國水利會議之便，一併提出，起國人之注意，又東北各大河流域之面積，佔東北總面積百分之九十強，可謂富水之鄕。在僞滿時代，日人有長期之水利建設計劃，北滿以松花江系統為中心，南滿以遼河系統為中心，自民國二十五年起開始調查則景工作，廿六年起訂有十年計劃，舉凡防水，造林，保土，蓄水，防洪，灌溉，水力發電等，應有盡有，宏大週詳，但因抗戰及太平洋戰爭之故，未能全部完成。以水力發電而論，日人預定在東北設立發電站四十五處，共發電五百八十五萬瓩；目前已完成者三處，四處正在綢續施工中。本人此次赴京開會，對發展整個東北水利事宜，已擬有提案。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>民主匈牙利的喪鐘</h3>
<p>値的我們注意的是最近在歐洲發展者的事態。這些事態的性質相當嚴重，可能影響到整個世界的大局。我們雖則還在東亞，因為世界是不可分的，對於這些在歐洲發展着的事態，仍不能不密切加以注意：（一）從南斯拉夫傳來的消息，謂此問既將組成巴爾幹聯邦，包含阿爾巴尼亞，及希臘背部的馬其頗均在南斯拉夫的控制下，以自治國名義，加入是項聯邦。同時據南斯拉夫京城來電，除保加利亞總理業理業已抵達外，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫又傳已行抵南斯拉夫京城。而狄托元帥更於此際發表談話，以為自由巴爾干人民必須統一，成為一個堅強整體，且復指出希臘局勢，即因不能統一而充滿危機，為聯合安全計，巴爾幹於斯拉夫人民必須携手一致。（二）蘇對芬蘭態度轉　強硬，芬國內正醞釀新局勢。（三）匈牙利發生政變，匈總理被迫去戰，親蘇政權因而在匈牙利出現。（四）美國停止對匈牙利貸款。（五）美國務卿馬歇爾宣稱：吾人當繼續拔助義大利，希望加斯貝利領導之新政府處處獲得成功，美國人民對於義大利之福利，具有深刻而有好的興趣。從這些事態的發展，我們不難想像「權利政治」如何在歐洲展布着。這局勢總繼續不斷地在歐洲發展下去，無疑地，關係整個世界和平的大局。</p>
<p>這些事態所表示的是什麼？不用說蘇聯與西方國家爭鬥的尖銳化。巴爾幹聯邦的組織，自然是美國增援希士後所產生的結果。此在狄托元帥談話裏，已經是至為明顯的了。但這裏所謂的巴爾幹聯邦，不是巴爾幹人民自動的結合，而是在南斯拉夫控制下總產生的，其目的顯然在企圖以「全巴爾幹」的力量，來對希臘及其其他各國施以壓力，庶幾整個巴爾幹都能變為蘇聯的附庸。這種壓力同時又加在芬蘭，而發生在匈牙利的政變，尤具有顯著的特徽。無疑地，凡此諸種事態的發生，都在明示蘇聯在企圖鞏固它在東歐的力量，想從芬蘭到南斯拉夫建立起一條堅固的「鐵幕」。在這鐵幕以後，蘇聯是絕對不許可絲毫有一點不利於蘇聯的政權存在。巴爾幹聯邦的組織，其目的在此：匈牙利的政變，其目的也在此。</p>
<p>這次出現在匈牙利的政變，我們並不感覺到突然：我們感到驚異的確實這次匈牙利政變之所由掀起，係因蘇方依據小資產當秘書長的陳述，公告前總理那基有叛國的罪嫌，而這位秘書長現已深入蘇方囹圄，蘇方的通告，認為那基總理有願　匈牙利民主的罪責，故在瑞士休假中的匈總理不得不提出解職在蘇方的支持下，錢陸軍總長丁尼斯出任總揆，小資產當顧名思義是具有濃厚的小資產階級意味的：這與主張以無產階級專政的政團，自不能水乳交融。在匈牙利之必將有政變的發生，自在一般人的意想之中。但這次政變之所以使世人驚異的，就是蘇方始終是此次政變的公開導演。丁尼斯政府，無意地，完全是在共產黨的控制下；而共產黨在匈牙利，截至目前止，至少還不是一個多數政黨。還是為此，所以我們看見匈牙利新政權的出現，其第一舉措，便在籌備選舉，庶這幾次纂奪而來的新政權，能在法律上有合理的基礎。無疑，如果選舉完成，親蘇政團必然會獲得絕對優勢，這是為此，匈牙利政變的結果是匈牙利初生民主的死亡。對於這初生民主的死亡，西歐民主各國自不得不由衷地寄予殷切的關注。如果英美聯合國向蘇抗議，干涉匈局，這便是一件極自然的事。</p>
<p>據發過新聞社電訊，此次匈牙利政潮，乃由於莫斯科四強外長會議失敗所致。美國與蘇聯，因彼此關係逐漸疏遠。故均竭力於秋季以前，在東歐及西歐鞏固其地位。匈牙利現已成為政治手段中心。蘇聯之行動，乃在消減現居多數之匈牙利小資產黨，已使共產黨處於有利的地位。美國為對付匈牙利政變，自不得不終止對匈貸款，向現成為歐洲局勢舉足輕重的意大利頻送其秋波。這是在這個意義下，我們看見有國務卿馬歇爾對意大利的親善表示。此後歐洲局勢將如何展開，實足為美蘇勢力的測標。出現在世界其他各地的局勢，都與此歐洲局勢的發展息息相關。</p>
<h3>貝祖詒予以申誡　政務官懲戒會決議書全文　（上文接第一版）</h3>
<p>（一）關於貝祖詒部份：（一）洩露央行存金底數。申辯書節稱，存金底數，央行同人始終絕對，保守秘密，總來敢有所洩露，中央造幣廠在滬設備全部破壞，久未重建，故不得已乃擇可靠金號銀樓分別熔製，迨至本年二月六日，該廠來函，謂設備完成，每日可鑄金條一千兩，經其照辦，至委託金號銀機熔化金塊之手　，並非由同灣餘一家總欖，向分兩組辦理，一為泰康潤，由該號出立收據，自行向央行領取金塊，改鑄造成條後，自行繳送央行入庫，不經同豐餘之手，一為同豐餘，由該號出立收據領取，其分配大豐恒，宏豐永，生源水，久成永，楊慶和，裕發永，祥和等七家金號熔化者，係轉委託性質，由同豐集餘對央行負份量及成色上之總責，故由其總領分發，蓋同豐集餘在茂前即代央行買賣黃金，久具往來歷史，信譽索著，該七家金號銀樓熔製金條，歸入同豐餘一組，由其負總責者，實為取得充分可靠之保證，以免發生意外，並無絲毫私見存乎其間，及所有央行明配黃金，以銀樓業整理委員會及多金業公會會員為對象，由整委會主任委員及公會理事和代表辦理瑟申請講買手續，並不經詹蓮生之手，吵嘴僧以五家金銀樓為對象，至交割時分為兩辦理同豐餘等四家為一組，由同豐餘加簽證明，泰康潤一家另成一組，由該號負責入出據領取，其所辦一切交易，並不經詹連生之手等語，被付慾戒人申辯意旨，以為熔化金塘塊及暗售黃金，係分由同豐餘及泰康潤兩組辦理，彼等即不至推悉央行存金之底數，惟查被付懲戒人所稱兩組中之泰潤一組，實際僅彼一家，而同豐餘一組，關於容化金塊，則包有一豐恒等七家之多，關於暗售黃金，則包有大豐恒等四家之多，且查央行指定信金之五家行號，除同應餘為詹連生所開辦者外，共集群四家據查均係由詹運生所介紹，則原彈劾案謂央行全部熔金數量使同禮餘洞悉，及五家行號配售黃金均由詹運生蓋章方能領取等由，自屬有所擾而云然，又據監察委員何漢文等調查報吿，自本年一月四日至二月十五日停售止，央行委託五家配售東金七九四四〇條，同豐餘佔數最多，竟逾半額，而同豐餘於政府宣布停止配售前，突大量購進金條，市價乃更飛漲等語，該同豐餘若非預知存金情形，何至如是，被付懲戒人縱非有意洩露央行存金底數之機密，要屬未能善盡其職責，自難辭失職之咎。（二）央行所指定配售黃金之五家行號，均係任意決定操縱，官商勾結。分採明配暗售兩種方式，明配以金業及銀樓業兩公會為對象，暗售以指定五家之行號為對象，明配之黃金不由五家行號負責，其暗售黃金雖　由五家行號以　對講電話與央行直接成交，但是否可以配售及配售數量之多寡，完全由央行斟酌情形，予以決定，並不操之五家之手，央行每日上午十時出售黃金，係以當日早晨九時各金號或外匯經紀人在電慶中所報吿之市面行情作決定配價之參考，先時間，在數秒鐘之內，各金號無從取得聨絡，以圖朦蔽，至於暗售黃金，係由五家行號各別以對講電電話與央行接洽，逐筆成交，其每筆售價，完全由央行依據當時所得各方行市報告參酌決定，其五家行號電洽購買，所報價格，認為不適當時，不予採用或不予配售，每日甚至每時每刻金價之決定，央行採取主動，並不完全以五家行號對講電話之報吿為準，又關於選定金業同業公會理事長詹運生出任領導，實因詹連生係金業中之合法領袖，且戰前與央行素有往來，徵之戰前在金業中最有資望之金業交易所理事長徐輔蓀君，亦以為其人可靠，又央行選擇金號，為求切實可靠並示公正無私起見，自當資成該理事長詹連生在公會會員中擇優推蘪，並為保持機密起見，經辦行號不能過多，決定之五家，均戰前代央行買賣黃金較多，歷史較公，信譽素著者，央行乘公選擇，極端審愼，絕非任意指定，漫無標準，絕無任詹蓮生一人把持操縱之意，安有官商勾結之事等語，查被付懲戒人對於此款申辯，固不無相當理由，惟央行所指定五家行號中之同豐餘一家，查尙未領有營業執照（見監察委員何漢文訊詹運生答話筆錄），即從而指定配售黃金，失職之咎，要無可辭。（三）擅定暗售辦法暗售金條，分配五家行號任其自由處分。據申辯略稱，查國行明售黃金，每日僅有一次，對於控制市塲，仍未能取得主動地位，為遵照政府政策，參酌整個市而情形，依據供求實況，隨時平抑金價起見，故於明配之外，隨同金價起伏，經由指定之該五家金號銀樓，以二三十條以內之少數分筆陸續出售，以應同業及客戶之需要，倘市價上漲，同業及客戶需要增多，則所售之次數亦增多，以收控制市塲穏定市價之効果，此種配售方法，在央行方面，係分別委託五家同時辦理，事前絕對保守秘密，以免為投機者所利用，此為主動而機密之方式，賣出黃金控制市塲之一種必要推施，其在各行號則係代客買賣，各依其同業及客戶之需要，遂筆同央行議買轉應同業及客戶之需求，並非自身向央行大批購進以後，可以自由處分，操縱市塲，央行辦理黃金買賣之初，曾經詳加研究，以為察酌市情相機應付，自有兼採之必要，並自玄年三月開始買賣黃金，所有一切配售情形，逐日以書面報吿　行政院宋前院長，配售黃金，悉本政府意旨辦理，絕未擅專自決等語，查暗售金條，在當時市塲之情況下，尙不能認為失當之措施，旣已將配售情形，逐日以書面報告行政院，即未便再課被付慾戒人以責任。（四）縱使部屬投機買賣黃金，不加約束，據申辯稱，按過去黃金自由買賣，國行行員以其自有款項，向金號購金，原非遠法，然本人為約束同人免招物議，間於一十五年三月就在任之初，通告同人對於此類情事，嚴切告誡，又於五月二十七日諭令同人不得兼營他業及代人經手款項，尤於辦公時間，不得利用本行電話等工具對外接洽上列事項，倘有故違，一經查明，立即開除，其直接主管人員並應時加督察，倘知而不報，一律受開除處分，上年五月間國行有一顧問之秘書，經本人發現其有利用本行電話向外從事接洽買賣行為，隨即令其離行，以上各項，國行均有案卷可查等語，查被付懲戒人對於本款申辯，不無理由，謂其從使部屬投機買賣黃金，尙無毫實可證，可予免議。（五）　然宣布停止黃金配售，並諉卸責任。申辯略稱，本年一月下旬，社會方面對於外匯調整，揣測紛紜，而局勢不安，市面游資日增，黃金需求日多，市價愈漲，純恃國行配售，勢難遏制，乃立即請示宋前院長，當經宋前院長召集外籍顧問人員會商決定，相機限制，減少售金額度，故於二月四日起即暫停暗售，對於銀樓業實銷需要，仍照常配售，至八日漲風仍厲，本人於當晚復晉京請示方針，當經宋前院長兩度召集有關人員，共同商討，並決定祇對銀樓配售，故於二月十日起宣布不配給金號，惟對銀樓業則繼續明配，並未宣布停止配售，迨至二月十六日中央頒布經濟緊急揩施方案，方完全停止，祖詒屬遵功令辦理，並非敢諉制責任，原彈劾所稱二月十日晨突停配售一節，實與當時事實不符等語，查被付懲戒人限制配售黃金之措施，衡諸情形，尙屬必要，應不負懲戒責任。</p>
<p>（二）關於王松濤部份：查彼付懲戒人王松濤，以中央銀行業務局襄理瘺出納科主任之地位，職司甚為重要，自宜遵守法令，忠戾服務，乃於該行總裁一再告誡之後，竟仍以其職務上之便利，購買金條，殊有利用地位投機漁利之嫌疑，據辯係介紹其戚馬洪祥隨同豐餘金號職員前往該金號講買，被同豐餘金號賬冊上訓列其名為買戶等語，冀圖卸責，殊難憑信，該被付懲戒人應受懲戒法上之處分。</p>
<p>綜上論結，被付懲戒人員祖詒有公務員懲戒法第二條第二款情事，王松濤有同法第二條第一款情事，員祖詒依同法第三條第一項第五款及第八條，王松濤依同法第三條第一項第一款及第四條議決如主文。（完）</p>

<h3>英移交印度政權　本年八月可實現　印領袖籲請國人和平相處</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：印督蒙巴頓今日在新德里宣稱，英國定八月十五日以政權交還印回兩自治領政府，按八月十五日乃日軍投降日。蒙巴頓指出此次決定印回分治，其目的乃在加速以政權交還印人，蒙巴頓定八月初離印返英。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：蒙巴頓今向印度人民保證，印度若在英方計劃下完成獨立後，英國決不在印度保留基地。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：蒙巴頓今日與印度臨時內閣內長會晤，事後宣稱：「爲維持過渡時期之和平起見，必要時將使用印度全部武力」。蒙巴頓謂此係印內閣之「秘密」，但又稱渠深信印度問題必可獲得和平解決，而決無流血慘劇。軍警六萬人已佈置完竣，防阻印回衝突。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里四日電〕印督蒙巴頓今日在此招待印度及外國記者數百人，聲明英國於被要求退出印度時，即當離印。渠云，定於一九四八年六月完成之印度政權的移轉，可能於今年即行完成，英國於被要求退出印度時即當離印，吾人於本年年底或已全部退出印度，或則尚有一部份須逗留較久。英人之在印以對於印度有用爲原則，如已不復有用而被請退出時，即當退出。余嘗盡力使英內閣使命團之計劃得被印度領袖所接受。此乃可行的計劃，但有賴於相互的善意及合作始得施行。此次被接受之計劃或非最好的解決辦法，但無論如何均當由印人自行決定其國家之未來。本人於發展此一計劃之每一階段中，均曾與印度領袖密切合作，故此一計劃提出時，並未使印度領袖感覺驚異。吾人承認此一計劃並非盡善盡美，苟能有完善之解決辦法，則印度領袖當早已能自行解決。本人所能爲者在盡力調和兩派對立之意見，並使一方了解如何可使其意見迎合對方。印督繼曰，勘界委會將包括當地民族之代表，任何英國官員決不强迫任何一方接受其意見，蓋此乃印度人的國家，自當由印人決定一切。吾人對於印度負責領袖之堅決表示，不論最後決定採取何種解決辦法，決當使用無流血的和平方法，深爲感激。我內閣之每一閣員均表示希望得以利用在印度之軍力，以防止流血及暴力。印督繼曰，設自治領地位之解決辦法，余已請求首相設法於兩個月內即完成此項立法，渠已表示首肯。印督復曰，或有人以爲英國並無退出印度之誠意，僅以自治領地位爲餌，要知此一計劃若非良好的解決辦法，則印度領袖當不致接受矣。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里三日電〕印度兩大領袖尼赫魯及真納，今晚向印人廣播，宣布接受英政府之移轉印度政權計劃，同時並呼籲遵守和平及秩序。尼赫魯之廣播有謂，吾人應忘却過去之一切，余雖以並不十分愉快之心情，接受此一計劃，但覺吾人此次決定，乃一正確之決定。回盟主席真納繼之發言，力言以和平方式移轉政權之重要，表示切盼印保持和平及和諧。錫克領袖臨時政府之國防部長辛格繼真納之後發言，稱　英政府之計劃，已開闢一超乎矛盾要求以上之新途徑，不失爲一有價值之計劃。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里三日電〕回盟領袖真納本日在此間電台發表廣播演說，命令西北邊省回盟人員立即停止騷動，並停止過去三月來反抗西北邊省政府之不服從運動。</p>
<h3>美對印政局觀感　希望能保持和平狀態</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓三日電〕國務院官員對英國宣布之移轉印度政權計劃，除表示希望在過渡期間得保持和平狀態外，並未表示其他意見。但彼等重申國務院前此發表之意見，聲明美國對印之友誼，及美政府吩望印度政局得有滿意解決之興趣。非正式方面對印度之將分裂，均感覺失望，但彼等指出英國方案中，並未排除他日再事組織統一的印度政府之可能性，故盼以統一爲目標之談判，他日仍能舉行。衆議員美國印人發言人賽勒向本社稱，自印度之經濟地理及歷史觀，余不信裂爲巴基斯坦及印度斯坦之印度，得以順利地發展。且巴基斯坦東西隔離，真納要求在東西兩部之間設一走廊，此舉將使局勢益形混亂。余並相信於錫克族拒絕回教徒觸及錫克聖城本哲布省之阿姆里察時，錫克族亦將提出錫克斯坦之要求。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺墨四日電〕新任美駐印大使葛蘭第，今日自此間乘船前往任所。葛氏對於英國所宣佈之印度獨立方案，並不表示意見，僅稱，美國人同情於印度問題，亦望其及早解決。</p>
<h3>杜魯門同意召開　西半球防務會議　阿根廷亦將參加</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕白宮頃宣稱：杜魯門總統現願與美洲其他國家，重新進行關於西半球防務會議之談判。阿根廷大使回國述職後，頃已返抵此間任所，曾與杜魯門及馬歇爾檢討其政府已採取之措施，並說明該國仍在履行關於泛美會議對戰爭與和平之任務。阿根廷大使繼表示其政府並無阻撓談判之意，並希望成立互助之協定，因此杜魯門遂亦表示願與期貨美洲各國進行協商，召開西半球防務會議，但希望阿根廷在美國參加防務協定之前，應言行一致云。</p>
<h3>阿根廷肅清　境內納粹勢力</h3>
<p>〔合衆社阿根廷京城三日電〕阿根廷外長頃宣稱：阿根廷境內之納粹財產收歸國有一事，現已進入最後階段，例如驅逐納粹份子出境一事，即爲阿根廷解除軸心勢力之主要措施，俾傳進而參加西半球之防務集團。聞墨魔之子維脫里奧有被驅逐出境之可能</p>
<h3>美普遍軍訓問題　國會將展開辯論</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約三日電〕美國在其强國教育之途徑中，現又面臨一次影響歷史之選擇，此即是否必須採取總統顧問委會所建議之普遍軍訓計劃是也。就美國而言，此乃空前反對與傳統完全不同之步驟，值茲美國謹慎走向領導世界及履行其領導責任之途徑之際，此事將在國會及社會上引起另一次大辯論，然其對國會則屬最難決定之問題。根據美國人士所抱之一貫思想，彼等之軍事任務，可由少數職業陸海空軍擔負之，原子彈雖已大爲改變一般人民對美國國防前途之想法，但多數國會議員仍固執其想習，相信若支持普遍軍訓，則在政治上將使有選舉權之人民印象不佳，而失去下屆選舉之票數，此實最大癥結。根據歷次民意測騐，其中有一次表示百分之七十五贊成普遍軍訓，爲國家安全所必需，但大多數國會議員，則表示不信，迄今已有若干議員認爲欲在本屆國會（將於七月三十日休會）通過任何類似軍訓法案爲不可能者。</p>
<h3>美參院今日表決　批准四國和約案　范登堡譴責匈牙利共黨</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓四日電〕美國參議院將於明日表決對義匈羅保四國和約之批准，參院外交委員會主席范登堡昨在參議院中，曾促國會速即採取行動，批准四國和約，俾使歐洲之復興工作，得以迅速展開。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕參院外交委員會主席范登堡今日在參議院發表重要演說稱：匈牙利共產黨攫取政權已「激起進一步之暴行感」，美國應請聯合國機構予以審訊。范氏並促請立刻批准義大利等國和約，預測共產黨「陰謀征服」匈牙利後，即將繼以「壟斷選舉」，且暗示美國可能採取行動，不致長期等待蘇聯合作，逕與渠對歐洲全面和約稽延未決一事，闡明態度，措詞强烈，反映其與政府數月來對蘇政策已趨一致。關於匈牙利政變，范氏亦與國務院見解相合，據謂共產黨「表示其民主觀念，從無此次之冷酷」。凡此苟係事實，美國或將自知向聯合國機構提出全部事件實屬義不容辭。匈牙利「現已成爲蘇聯又一衛星國」賴籍批准而非否決對匈和約，庶可保全美國無上利益。「如不批准該約，蘇聯將毫無阻撓，繼續控制匈牙利」。此事將使該國民主份子感覺氣沮。反之，批准該約「至少可在理論上恢復匈牙利之自由國家地位。然後，任何侵犯該國事件可由聯合國機構加以處理」。</p>
<h3>國際管制原子問題　美蘇觀點截然相反　蘇堅持銷毀現在原子彈</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖三日電〕此間主官方面頃談稱：聯合國原子能委員會本日會議，不啻爲美蘇兩國對於原子炸彈之捉迷藏遊戲。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯提出一項對於原子能委員會報告書之修正案，規定「禁止各國保持並製造原子武器之國際公約，爲欲使其有效起見，應由一項確立國際管制原子能制度之公約完成之。」此項修正案在事實上即現存原子武器應在管制制度成立之前，先行加以銷毀之謂。此在另一方面，原子能委員會報告書中所包含之美國計劃，則主張先設立管制制度，然後銷毀現有原子武器，俾使在製造原子武器方面居先之國家獲得保障，不致在禁止原子武器與成立管制制度之間歇期內，被他國乘虛攻擊。美蘇兩國觀點之截然相反，在本日會議時甚爲明顯。比利時及澳洲代表對於美國立塲，表示願爲其後盾。加拿大代表麥克瑞登發問曰：國際管制原子能制度中「監察」一語涵義若何？葛羅米柯當即答曰：蘇聯接受原子能管制制度，悉視先行銷毀原子武器而定。據消息靈通人士稱，蘇聯此種觀點，決非美國所能同意。</p>
<h3>澳洲聯邦政府通過　五年國防新計劃　擔負英帝國太平洋防務</h3>
<p>〔合衆社康白拉三日電〕據可靠方面消息：澳大利亞內閣已通過五年之防務計劃，包括撥款研究火箭及原子能在內，並已擇定弗林德山爲試放火箭之地點，在數月內可望即開始試騐。又據聯合社電：澳洲戰後防禦計劃大致如下：（一）設立太平洋强力連環基地；（二）使澳洲成爲南太平洋各區防務基地，而在雪黎設立英國防禦計劃中最强大之海軍基地。</p>
<h3>美國會亟應授權總統　遣派駐外軍事代表團　馬卿籲請國會通過法案</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕國務卿馬歇爾本日要求國會，以永久性之權力授與總統，得徇外國之邀請派遣陸海軍代表團前往各該國，並謂以此種權力授與總統，並不違反聯合國憲章，此舉除有助美國國家利益而外，並與美國傳統之援助友邦以保持其獨立之政策相符。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓三日電〕國務卿馬歇爾本日告衆院軍事委員會稱：國會倘立即採納一項立法，擴展戰時總統權力，使總統有權派遣海陸軍顧問代表團留駐國外，對美國利權之維護與增進，必有莫大裨益。馬氏强調說明，此等代表團唯有在外國政府請求時，方可派遣。派遣前由總統慎重考慮，務使該團任務，止於顧問性質。渠又指出，此等代表團人數，以少爲宜，並以專家爲主，不得從事任何情報工作。依聯合國憲章第七十八條規定，會員國間之關係應「基於對主權平等原則之尊重」。但在某國國內秩序紊亂，危機深重時，此種目標，似難達成。一旦友國政府請求本國派遣海陸軍代表團時，倘總統並無派遣之權力，則僅剝奪總統運籌帷幄之能力而已。蓋美國政府曾聲言貫澈其維護全世界和平之政策，並以世界强國之資格，全力參預世界事務也。馬歇爾稱：國會若不通過此一立法案，勢將使美國目下駐伊朗與中國之使團必須撤退，渠表示不信念，謂「此種行動勢必有害於美國之利益」。馬歇爾說明，駐南京之美國顧問團，亦在總統之戰時權限下派遣者，「與該國之內爭，絕無關係。吾人之對華政策，向爲協助該國發展有效之海陸軍，人數有限，務使中國財政機構不受過分之負担。」本議案與上次國會所提出者完全相同，已由衆院通過而向參院作有利之報告，但參院在國會休會前，尚未採取行動。</p>
<h3>希臘當局贊同　美軍駐希境</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦四日廣播：希臘內閣國防委員會主席尼齊洛斯發表談話稱：希臘陸軍實力需要加倍增强，始能應付大局，對於美軍駐希足以抵制國外援助遊擊隊之建議，表示同意。按此項建議係政府方面私下提出，因傳說共產黨國際旅團準備由阿爾巴尼亞及南斯拉夫開入希臘，但衆信美國不致立刻採取此一步驟云</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社貝爾格勒四日電〕希臘報載國際軍一旅集中史比里特，準備開入希臘之說，頃由南斯拉夫負責方面加以否認。</p>
<h3>匈農民黨　厲行清黨</h3>
<p>〔路透社匈京四日電〕匈牙利最大政黨農民黨（即小地主黨）之執委會，頃議決對全黨黨員由一五八委會實施調查，以消减妨碍聯合內閣合作及進展之因素。按農民黨領袖匈前總理那基被蘇聯指責參與政變陰謀後，已於上週辭職。農民黨之右翼份子於二月間被指陰謀政變以恢復前攝政霍爾第，有多人被捕下獄。</p>
<h3>美蘇混合委員會討論　韓臨時政府政綱　令小組會尅日提出調和方案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城四日電〕美蘇混合委員會頃發表第二號聯合公報稱：委員會今日討論各項文件，內含有與朝鮮政治份子磋商該國成立臨時政府事之調令與條件，並已令小組會在六月六日以前，提出調和各項原則之文件草案。委員會又討論有關臨時政府政綱而尚未完全商妥之兩項問題云。美國首席代表白朗今日會議後，並未循例招待報界，解釋公報內容。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城四日電〕美霍奇中將致函蘇聯之考洛特柯夫將軍稱：如蘇佔領軍當局准許美國記者進入蘇軍司令部所在地平壤，則美當局當准許塔斯社記者至漢城，該函在六月三日發出。</p>
<h3>勒琪令南韓各機關　採用臨時政府名義</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城四日電〕美蘇聯合委員會會談正略有進展之時，南韓軍政廳負責方面忽透露：勒琪將軍與民政長官安在鴻曾於五月十七日以每一四一號命令，規定南韓立法議院及司法機關，自即日起一律冠以南韓臨時政府字樣。按美蘇會談之前，南韓民族領袖及民間團體，尤以韓國前獨立政府之金尤等，曾擬要求組織臨時政府，但當時曾遭美駐軍當局之禁止。</p>
<h3>裕仁出巡　自稱以甘薯充饑</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京四日電〕日皇裕仁今晨離京前往大阪與神戶各區巡視，爲期十二日，此乃新憲法推行以來首次出巡。據消息靈通人士稱：麥帥最近一次會晤日皇時，曾勸日皇從新偕同皇后巡視各地。同時日本各報登載日皇皇后之訪問記，日皇自稱以甘薯爲主要食品，閑時賦詩自娛。皇后飼養之蠶，不久可望收穫　子約一百六十公斤，皇后稱：「我已開始學習英語，但是很難，我讀的是美國童話。」</p>
<h3>聖地調查團　定下週三出發</h3>
<p>臨時總部設耶路撒冷</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖三日電〕官方頃宣佈聯合國調查巴勒斯坦委員會一行十一人，定於本月十一日乘坐專機飛往巴勒斯坦實地調查，將設總部於耶路撒冷青年會，並歡迎當地有聲望之人士，向該會陳述意見。</p>
<h3>安理會辯論　國際警備軍問題</h3>
<p>蘇態度執拗難獲協議</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖四日電〕聯合國機構安全理事會今日準備對世界警備軍組織事宜，開始一般辯論，各理事國代表已結成一綫，反對蘇聯意見。美國代表預定開會後即發言，聞將堅決擁護軍事參謀委員會之基本報告書，該委員會等擬擬世界警備軍組織計劃，中，美，英，法四國委員一般意見均相符合，唯蘇聯委員對三分之一以上基本原則，表示異議。據聯合國機構副代表詹遜之發言人稱，國際警備軍乃整個聯合國機構安全制度之核心，美國將籲請安理會公開詳細討論此問題，並早日建立國際陸海空軍。</p>
<p>裁軍問題陷入僵局</p>
<p>又五大國代表爲裁軍委員會擬具工作程序，昨日會商，未獲協議，現已實際放棄此企圖，並通知聯合國機構秘書處繕具報告書，以便提交裁軍委員會，說明五國代表未能擬定此工作程序。五國代表將於星期五秘密會議，研究此報告書，料將以此問題交返裁軍委員會。聞五國代表意見歧異，重大因素之一，厥爲蘇聯外次葛羅米柯圖使原子能管制問題，與裁軍委員會之任務，發生連繫。但截至目前爲止，裁軍委員會僅奉令草擬裁减軍備與軍力之建議。蘇方頃已通知聯合國機構原子能管制各有關代表，謂彼等對蘇聯要求裁軍委員會禁用原子武器，遲早須加決定。</p>

<h3>參會延至今日閉會　房租標凖提案　大會決予保留　多數認爲不應由參會訂定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會三次大會於昨日上午舉行第六次會議，下午舉行第七次會議討論提案。本定昨日閉幕，因議案甚多，故昨日會議雖至晚八時四十分始散，仍不及完畢，因此將於今日下午三時繼續延會一天，然後舉行閉幕儀式。</p>
<p>昨日大會中以討論房租標凖問題時，情況最爲熱烈。該會地政、、社會委員會予以保留。</p>
<p>朱參議員文德認爲參議會無權更改房租標凖，渠並貢獻市府意見四點：　對前定一面八十倍及一百四十倍之標凖應撤除，　請市府轉呈立法院將房屋租賃條例送本市公布施行，　切實調查取締不法房租，　請市府迅予完成房屋登記。馬君碩認爲目前房屋租賃情形均不合理，主張房屋租賃條例應立即施行，根據此條例訂立房租標凖才是合理。張志韓要求大會先決定二點：　大會是否同意修改市府前定一八〇及一四〇倍之標凖？　如同意則其最高額是否由參議會決定？此二點解悶後，再討論房租辦法。</p>
<p>應由　市府　擬訂</p>
<p>駱清華表示：市府對於糧價紗價物價，均由其評議而並不交參議會決定，則對於房租標凖亦不妨請其擬定合理辦法。渠並發表意見二眯：　市府前定房租倍數，擬請即日撤廢，另由市府裏設房租評議機構，訂立房租評議暫行辦法。　市府應多方鼓勵新屋之增建，舊屋之修茸。張廼作謂，市府前定標凖既無法切實執行，則由市府建議，小組會通過之一八〇〇倍亦不會合理，參議會無權議決此案，主張根本不必討論。路式導、李文傑均造成駱參議員意見，保留此案，由市府參考意見擬訂。另有若干議員亦表示應保留。但反對者亦有，認爲應替一般市民設想，訂一合理標凖。</p>
<p>市長　希望　支持</p>
<p>後由市長解釋謂：市府並地意要將此事推到參議會身上，因奉行政院令須將此標凖諮詢民意機關，故請大會討論。但如不立標凖，岀無法評議。如保留此案後則市府將不能訂標凖，希望參議會支持。</p>
<p>最後付諸表決，通過「保留」。由市府自行根據臨時參議會關於房租辦法之決議（即關於改訂本市房租計算標凖請市政府對業主之收益及市民之負担力量兼籌並願）辦理。</p>
<p>又關於「重申本會一屆二次大會決議，處長䙬分配房屋住戶之租賃，以免引起騷擾」一案，參議員建議設立一執行機構，但據市長表示，此事僅能由人情上着手，若設立機構，則無法律可根據執行。故經大會決議：（一）重申本會一屆二次大會決議　長被分配房屋住戶之租賃權，（二）根據上項主張，請市府及法院特予維護。</p>
<p>機塲佔用民地　限期辦理手續</p>
<p>又關於地政提案，昨日大會續有討論，除關於房租問題保留外，餘均經大會通過，計：（一）「請市政府迅與中央有關部會交涉，將龍華虹橋江灣大塲四機塲佔用民地未辦重用手續者，應限期辦理征用給價，其未使用而仍圈佔之是發，應即發還原主，以安民命案」。決議：除劃橋機塲墓地如何使用巳另有專案討論外，其餘照審查意見通過。至於推定代表赴京請願一節，另行併案辦理。（二）「請當局發還中央市塲所有土地房屋以重民有産權案」，決議：原案通過，函請市政府查明業主發還。</p>
<p>敵僞辦公大廈　撥各機關應用</p>
<p>（三）「擬請將本市敵僞辦公大廈，撥充市屬各機關團體慶用案」，通過。（四）「請市府迅即指定市有公地，或征用私有空地，撥充各區獻校舊地案」，原則通過，函請市政府飭地政局迅即勘擇地點，每區一至五畝，並逕與獻校籌募墓金委會商洽辦理。（五）「龍華鎮甲申村房屋以市府奉令拆遷，靖函市府轉咨後勤司令部在未有合理安置以前，免予執行案」，決議：函請市政府轉咨後勤部，應體念民生艱苦，准予照舊居住。（六）「擬請市政府負責與中央有關部會交涉，迅將本市前被敵僞圈佔之民地民房民倉，現由中央各部會或駐滬之軍事機關接收保管或使用者，限期清理髮還原主案」，決議：函請市府負責與眏　管部會交涉，媽於三個月內清理髮還原主。</p>

<p>堅忍的倫敦人  倫敦十日航訊　本報特派員毛樹清　　大西洋船上，我讀完了最近一期的「時代雜志」，也拜讀了那篇洋洋灑灑的，論美國領導世界文化建設的演講。今天沒有任何人敢否認美國當前急起直追的事實。問題的重心，不在美國的「接防」，而在於歐洲是否將從此沈淪不起？　　船上，我聽見一位加拿大人，一位美國人，一位英國紳士，辯論着英國今天　的國運，是在走上坡路？還是在向下滾？我聽了一點多鍾，做不出我自己的結論。一直到我到達了倫敦以後，讀到了「每日郵報」的社論，才深深明白了英國人今天他們自己的想法。郵報的社論作者說：「也許常常以誇耀　當的美國人，今天在說：英國正在Going　Down。但我們自己社裏明白：熬過了這個苦難，我們仍然有光榮的明天！」　　一塊外匯一滴血　　郵報那篇社論，是針對「度支大臣」（主計長）達爾頓在下院報告明年度的預算方針而發的。達爾頓爲了報告預算，挨盡了漫罵和調嘲。明年度的英國總預算是三十一萬萬八千一百萬鎊，財政收入的來源，多半要靠增加稅收，特別是提高「香烟」稅率。達爾頓賠着笑臉向議員們說：「聽預算報告，一定會使諾位頭痛，真如同請諸君拿鼻子嗅監巴一樣。」　　在達爾頓的演講裏，我檢得了一點今天英國經濟情况的要領。第一，今天英國經濟的最大問題，是一個外匯問題。達爾頓一再稱說「珍貴的外匯」，「像珠寶一樣的美國金洋」，西洋人重視珠寶，中國人重視汗血，譯作中文，應該是「一塊外匯一滴血。」我在紐約所寫的通訊裏，曾經描寫過：英國人那時候向美國借款的苦辛。許多莫名其妙的美國下議院議員，大腿翹在二腿上，在華盛頓大罵英國紳士，有的說：「錢可以借給他，但不准他（指英國人）再趾高氣揚，再目中無人！」有的說：「以後不要再叫英國人哼哼用鼻子講放話！」銷數最大的紐約新聞，也曾經用生動的題目，反對對英貨款，它說：「我們有幾千萬退伍軍人，沒有房子住，沒有獲得職業，政府該化的錢多得很，爲什麼送給英國人去化？」　　縱然是許多「廢話」，給倫敦的印象是深刻的。世界上很少有一個民族，像英國人那樣有志氣。舐有錢人家的「肉骨頭」，英國人決不願再來第二次。但是光有志氣，沒有辦法，至多衹能像伯夷叔齊那樣餓死。英國人目前，就在利用他的政治天才，社會基礎，實行他的關起門來的「辦法」。　　一個重要的準則　　辦法中最重要的一個準則，是减少外匯的消耗。據達爾頓的數字說：消耗外匯最厲害而最不必要的，是香烟，菸葉和照相材料，包括電影。英國男子，幾乎人人都抽烟，烟是英國人的生命。打仗以來，英國社會的「烟荒」，從未斷過，本國烟生產不够，紙烟店限制每人每天購買一包，英國人平常很少有笑臉，但當他們每人平常很少有笑臉，但當他們每天踏進紙烟店的時候，總是一副和藹可親，笑容可掬的樣子。前年我在倫敦，住在克里福特的軍官招待所裏，有一天去一家紙烟買烟，看見老闆兇狠得像土匪一樣的臉孔，當時就顧他吵架。這次到倫敦，一位烟癮最大的中國朋友幫告我：「進香烟店要非常和他客氣」。他　告兩次：他每天可以購買兩包，原因是爲了抽烟，不惜跟「香烟店的老闆娘談戀愛」！　　因爲英國烟的生產量不够，倫敦市上，處處是埃及烟和土耳其烟，價錢都比英國烟貴，美國香烟在市上也很流行，有許多都從紐約郵包裏寄來。這次達爾頓的預算計劃中，凡是兩角錢一包的香烟，要抽六角八分的重稅，他說，「爲了節省像珍珠一樣的外匯，英國的香烟和菸葉進口量，在明年度財政年度裏，至少要减低三分之一。」　　「烟癮」雖然難熬，但畢竟還是生活上的次要部份，當前英國人日常生活中感覺最嚴重的，恐怕決不是紙烟。我到倫敦的第一天，就搬進福德公園轉灣角上一家大旅館——康白蘭飯店居住，晚上，我在旅店的餐廳內用膳，喝湯的時候，沒有麪包。我問西崽能不能找一塊麪包給我，他輕身附耳告訴我：　　「如果你要了麪包，就沒有甜品，這是倫敦的新規矩！」　　一粥一飯思來處　　麪包在英國，是一件非常恐慌的問題，英倫三島面積小，破壞了的農業田荘，一部份還沒規復，小麥的生產量不够。現在倫敦人享用的農產品，都從丹麥，荷蘭，阿根廷運來，路邊，運輸貴，而且又消耗外匯。報紙上成天把這些實際情形，告訴給讀者，具有幾百年民主訓練的英國人，心裏都明白：「一粥一飯，當思來處之不易，」他們不把「節儉」放在嘴上吹，而是在身體力行的實行。　　據說在倫敦有這樣一個故事：一位中國留學生，在一家西餐館中用餐，吃麪包的時候，他把麪包四週的一層破皮剝掉，因爲硬皮不容易下咽。在其它任何國家，這樣的舉措，該是極平常的事。但在倫敦，就還達到鄰座一位老太太的不滿。她伸過頭去問他：「先生，你們中國糧食，一定很豐富的罷！」這位留學生知道「來勢不妙！」趕緊把那些麪包皮，和着一口冷水吞下去。　　法律和道義的制裁，使這會經雄視字實的「不列顛王國」。在無聲無息中，過着臥薪嘗膽的生活，我到倫敦的第二天，替一位紐約朋友，帶了一匣糖菓給他的倫敦的女友。她接着糖菓的時候，眼睛水汪汪的，像感激得流出淚來的樣子，事後，她才詳細告訴我：政府限制每人享受「甜品」的份量，從前一星期規定三個昂司（三兩甜品），後來改爲二個半昂司，不久以後，將改爲每人每月兩個半昂司，小孩嬰兒也是一樣，　　國富民强的錀匙　　打仗以前，西洋人吃巧克力，如同家常便飯，西洋的醫生，常常告訴病人：多喫甜品，可以補腦。尤其是兒童與嬰孩，糖菓更是生命的一部份，在英國，法院裏據說常常收到兒童們的來信：「檢舉我的母親，吞沒了我的糖菓票子，」法庭認爲這是破壞他們的「分配制度」，母親必須處罰。　　也許全世界衹有這一個民族，行得通這樣的制度。倫敦人每一個月喫一個雞蛋，一星期喫一次肉。但是，他們的社會秩序，從來就沒有亂過。在倫敦街頭漫步，你可以看見玻璃櫥窗內漂亮的衣料，汽車和日用品，甚至汽車，像上海先施永安新新，大新一類的大公司，樓上樓下也是擠滿着人，就外表上看，我這次來，比兩年前繁榮得多。但是，這種繁榮是地數辛酸的眼淚交織起來的，英國人自己買東西，都要有配給制度的票子，那些最漂亮，量華貴的工業生產品，英國人是全數用在出口的，英國人自己，絕對享受不到。　　英國人知道：規復戰後的出口貿易，是英國重臻富强的錀匙，勞工黨的最幹練的脚色，克利浦斯，自始至終，就掌握着出口貿易部。據貿易部發表的數字，從去年下半年起，英國的輸出量，月有增加，特別是對中東和遠東　　十個先令一頓飯　　我來倫敦是爲了過路，匆匆幾天，廉白蘭旅館十四先令一天的房金，（合美金二元九角），十個先令一頓飯餐，包括音樂和跳舞。英國人要「面子」，過境的旅客，都特別通融，每天仍然有一片薄得可以被風吹動的牛肉，早上，還用漂亮講究的刀叉和銀色盤子，把早餐送到臥室來，雖然早餐的內容，是一條鹹魚，一片麪包，和一塊「假牛油」，但我每次看到那些侍者們，鄭而重之的端荘招待，我心裏常常發笑　　英國之所以永遠不會到下來，也許就靠的這一份不茍且的民族性，他們對國家有信心，英國人做任何一件事，都「像煞有介事」。我從來沒有聽見過一個英國人灰心地嘆氣，也從來沒有看見一個英國人，絕望疲倦地搖頭。到環境最艱難的時候，法國人常常伸出兩手，上下擺動，表示他已經沒有了辦法。美國人碰着困難，做一個鬼臉，吹一聲口哨，或者講一句屁話，自動下蛋。但是英國人就從不這樣，許多人說英國人冷酷，如果我們設身處地，真是一切把國家放在第一，我覺得我們寧學冷酷的英國人。津浦路浦兗段通車典禮，於六月一日在兗州車站舉行，由孔令煊小姐剪彩。　　（本報記者章繩治攝）　　孟廟正殿　（本報記者凌松壽攝）孟子　故居　鄒縣小駐  兗州廿八日訊　本報記者凌松壽　　從滕縣到兗州，記者在亞聖孟子的故鄉——鄒縣——停了一下。　　鄒縣的城區小得可驚；城裏的市面不及城外，但是城外的一條大街，真實在够不上呌做「街」。大商店固然沒有，小商店也很少。我和視察鐵路搶修狀况的陣指揮官紹平由將等一行十餘人，在一家飯館裏吃飯，據說這是鄒縣唯一的一家飯館，而土床茅舍，已經十足表現出鄉村中泥土的氣氛了。　　鄒縣農產原很豐富，出產以麻及蠶蘭等爲大宗；然而它却一直停滯在沒落的農業社會過程中，而掩沒了它在兩千多年前的繁盛和發射出來的光芒，在這兒，找不到「進化」或「文明」，滿眼接觸到的只有兩樣：一樣是「樸」，還有一樣是「笨」。　　鄒縣城外有孟子廟，其規模之大，僅次於曲阜的孔廟，記者偷十數分鍾之閑，得以一飽眼福。　　正門關着，這是非有特殊的大典不開的。我們從西側門進去。門前高懸着縣政府和奉祀官的保護佈告。進門後，　　夾道古柏　　一片青翠之色，且先洗盡了我們一行在黃沙中的征途倦困。在很長的甬道兩旁，除去了古老的柏樹而外，別無雜樹。有的異直參天，有的欹斜取勢，有若干株樹已經枯去，但是老幹婆娑，霜皮溜雨，形成了牛首，馬面，蟠龍，捲蛇……種種的怪柏，真堪入畫。風入柏間，一陣的龍吟虎嘯之聲外，地下密布的濃蔭，也晃動不已；記者默想如果是一個月夜，置身此間，該又是一片樣子的清幽景色？　　折而向北，迎面是一排碑碼，高低大小，並不一致，而土面所鐫刻的讚嘆景仰之辭，則全是一樣，另有乾隆御碑亭一座，二三丈長的一塊石碑，產於一個石頭的大烏龜的背上。　　穿過一重門，我們看見正殿了。　　正殿上下　　　間有一塊「亞聖殿」的直匾。我們走上了石階，走進了正殿，這時，射入我們的限簾中的，純中一片古典的美。雕着細緻花紋的大石柱，高峻的宮殿式的房屋，漆着紅紅綠綠的圖案的棟樑……孟子像大槪有丈餘高，端冕垂裳，前面的神主上寫着：「亞聖孟子位」五個字。再後面則是寢殿，祀孟子夫人神位。　　時間不允許記者詳細觀摩，我們又離開大殿，一直迎着正門走出，正門之前，有屋兩間，右邊是陳設祭器之處，左邊是盥洗之處。此外，在正門的走廊兩旁，分列着鍾鼓各一。鼓皮上也漆有圖案，皮已經破了，這該是失修已久之故。記者在兗州聽山東省政府魯西南辦事處彭國棟主任相告，他已飭鄒縣縣政府撥款三百萬元從事整理，而崇聖瞔。　　孟廟東側　　有一株「柏抱槐」，一侏柏樹，年久中空，裏面生出一株槐樹，向南方又出，兩樹大有數園，枝濃葉茂，共存共榮，這是孟廟中的名瞔之一。　　短短十幾分鍾的旅程小息，走馬觀燈式地游歷了一下這中國第二大思想家的聖地，自不免烟雲過眼之感。然而慰情聊勝於無，但願他年有機會再來此地一溫舊夢耳！水淹福州城  福州卅一日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予　　「大地陸沉了！」閩江上游經過了數日來的豪雨，山洪傾瀉，前日閩江下游水位高達六·一八公尺，前晚十二時，福州城內低　地帶如台江汎，中洲，三保，洗馬橋，茶亭，南門兜，洪山橋等處洪水先後登陸，一子夜間，城內四分之三盡成澤國，市民於夢中爲水驚醒，眼看波浪滔滔，情勢頗爲嚴重，人們在咀咒大陸行將陸沉，但是，大家相信「關老爺磨刀水」的流傳，還在每年這時都有一次洪水，倒也用不着少見多怪，君不見「水都」威尼斯，波光輝映，別有一番風趣。　　許多機關，學校，住宅皆已浸入水中，有些地帶水深達五六尺，且水流湍急，波濤洶湧，市內汽車一律停駛，以舢板航行，所謂「陸地行舟」。　　市警察局爲防患溪洪暴漲成災，並救護被水居民安全起見參照往年成例，在洪水區城暫時停止值崗，另而指定員警分別駕駛救生船隻，前往各處救護，並往返巡邏，以防趁「水」打劫，一時水上警艇穿梭游弋，煞是緊張。　　經二日之濫汜，溪洪逐漸回河，交通於駕恢復，惟有些地帶則仍爲水所據，據精略統計，次被水淹地區，坍倒房屋百餘棟，淹斃小孩一名，財物損失一時則難估計，假如追究責任，這是市政工程問題，咎不在關老爺身上。復興中的台茶  台北五月廿五晶航訊　本報駐台記者楊育　　台灣前年光復以後，農林處開始接收日本在台灣經營的茶業，直至去年二月底才大體完成，當時接收的部門是：（一）一般茶業行政機關，（二）茶葉傳習所，（三）平鎮與魚池兩地的茶葉試騐所，（四）茶業企業機關包括三井·中野·等八處會社以及所屬十三個初製茶廠，內二所停閉已久，一所經颱風吹坍，近已修復，故已有十一廠開工；又精製茶廠四所，已有三動工，精製茶廠多在台北：一廠在武昌街茶葉公司的貼隣，專製紅茶，過去年產五百萬磅；二廠在港町，專製烏龍茶，烏龍是台灣的名產，全世界僅福建出產少許專銷南洋，本省烏龍茶百分之九十均銷往美國；三廠在宮前町，規模較小，專製香片茶，台灣稱之爲包種茶，香味濃烈，是僅次於烏龍的精品。（五）茶園，分佈全省，總面積在四萬六千畝左右。至於民間經營的粗製工廠一共有二百十三所之之，精製廠亦有八十一所，茶園有五十六萬餘畝，可是大多荒蕪，經過年來努力整理，但復員的程度也衹有十之六·七。茶葉公司的陳代總經理語記者：復興台茶，第一步須復興茶園，要使茶葉能與其他作物競爭，就不能使它價格低，利潤薄。公司自有的四萬六千畝茶園，多委託山民管理經營，一切設施由公司加以指導，僅微收極少的地租充作田賦，茶葉的搜購全按照市價付款。接收時僅有二十萬斤的收獲，可是現在已能取得一百萬斤左右，至其他的茶園在去年十二月時曾發放了六千萬元台幣的茶貸，直接扶助茶園的復興，今年七月底到期，茶農可以每斤十五元的代價向公司繳納毛茶來償還貸款。</p>

<p>出版界文藝心理學  但蒙　　朱光潛著　開明書店版　　在廣泛的交藝靑年羣裏，普遍渴望着有幾種可以帮助他們打進文藝領域中去的理論當籍，作為敲門磚或領路標，可是却又至今還缺乏着一部較有效用的手册。目下固然多的是指導靑年們學習文藝初階的出版物，但通常不是本淺顯的，便是過分精專。前者使閱者稍嚐即止，無從　及整個文藝世界的景物和悟解生活在文藝空氣中所要的努力；後者使初習者望而却步，或竟養成刻板的經院觀念，緊閉到圖書館裏去。為了要找一本能介於上述兩項程度間的讀物，本書便將極適宜地塡補到這隙位來。　　所謂「文藝心理學」僅是一種「美學」。然而跟別的美學不同，因為本書有其獨特的路向。據作者自已的話，這是册「從心理學觀點研究出來的美學」是一　研究文藝理論的書，是一册研究文藝的創造和欣賞以至於文藝批許的書。不僅抽象的誤美學原理，而且是實證地去追討文藝形式及文藝內容的脈絡，因之再撮出一文藝的烏瞰。作者的原意在寫給一般有志於深刻地愛好文藝的靑年，所以不淺，不使得讀者像一水手說天文」或「看護婦說醫槃」似的全憑粗疏的經騐而有一客觀系統的嚴密的科學的認識取為依據；也不太深，讓祇有欣賞文藝興趣的人拒不敢接受。　　本書的主幹分爲文藝的創造　和文藝的欣二部。無論是創造或欣賞，無論是站在側畔旁視或處身局中去表現，第一須經過些傳統見解的淘鍊，不是只仗私已的雜亂經騐就能算是充實了的。這一點，作者在每一小節目地方都注意着，所以這具備了理論書藉的優長而無其瑕疵，把握了理論書籍的效用而沒有與現實脫筍。　　作者在本快點不祇是介紹些西洋近代美學的收穫，並且增益牠以作者自己所感到的天才見解，這與一切坊間的材是勝過多多。作者雖客觀的地位去叙述，，他也擲下他的斷語和評話。他比較，他折衷，他引申，無數邇來被熱烈地受討論和爭執的各家對美學的學說，再愼勤地寫下作者自己的看法。他也許沒有意圖要創立自已的系統，但他的提獨紫領的確是可責的。他似乎採擷康德到克羅齊一綫相傳的形式派美學為信仰，認為美感經騐純粹地是形相的直覺，然而又能走出康德和克羅齊的理論束縛，察覺到人生是有機體，因而反對克羅齊派的機械觀和抽象分析。　　從第一章到第四章是初步分祈「美感經驗是什麼？」的這一最基本的課題。「在美感經騐中我們的心理活動是什麼樣？」和「什麼樣的事物纔能算是美？」作者很引人入勝地講，由殘臻深，逐一說明了美感經騐的四要素：「形相的直覺」，「心理的距離」，「移情作用」，及「內模倣」。每一單位都分析和引伸得那麼周密，舉例，比喻，徵擇西洋哲學家的名言，再加些中國古賢的意見，使任何讀者不但懂得作者所述敍的意見，並且能相信牠，應用牠。作者從心理學走到美學，如此熟練，如此嫻順，如此無繼！　　接着第五章，是「關於美感經騐的幾種誤解」；第六章是「美感與聯想」。前一章是上四章的補充，指出了（一）美感與快感的混淆；（二）美感態度與批評態度的混淆；和（三）單純眞覺與名理思考的混淆等三種通常的誤解及其解蔽。後一章是以下諸章和上述諸章的連接，是獨立的一個問案。　　第七八兩章「文藝與道德」討論到文藝善惡的價値問題。以下第九章起才開始發掘到美學的中心。第九章「自然美與自然醜——自然主義與理想主義的鏠讓」解決了久久紛爭着的文藝上二種對立競鬥的看法；並且進一步地予「美」和「醜」以一輪麼的界說，分別出美學標凖的玄釋。第十章繼承着上章的結論「　術的美　不是自然的　　」而另立出美的學理標準，再將美善真，的領域辦析淸楚。到這裏已很完全地講盡了美學的　本知識。第十一章是批評克羅齊派美學的，是極聰明的介紹和立設，摘溢出傳達　偵　　的　　。　　第十二章起是另一主要部份的始　。從「藝術的起源與遊戲」，議到「藝術的創造」。第十三章是講「創造」的基本倏件：根像與靈感；第十四章是講「創造」的完備條件：天才和人力。這爾章的納容最為繁複，最為豐富，整倆地分析一件藝術品被製成所壓閱的難境，終於說一件藝術品的造就是挺困苦的。十五寧以下零碎地講述機個藝術上的具體問題：「關性美與柔性美」，「悲劇的喜感」，及「笑與喜劇」，是本書小最輕鬆和有趣的三章，讀者在限光的每一陸旅行裏都看到有値得沉思回味的緣革。最後三章附錄，分別地討論到顏色美，形體美和聲音美，是關於繪盡，造形美術，和音樂的，都採取最近代的新學說。　　本書的中部大約屬於研究文藝的創造，前後諸段則偏徧重於欣賞。然而決不分裂得太機械，因為欣賞也是一種創造的反映，所以作者一元地個別地予以闡明。同時，本書雖是「心理的」，但也生理地或社會地，‘以及哲學地去探尋文藝諸觸　的眞理。牠的長處將有下列三種：（一）實用的，每一章每一節都不曾駕空胡扯，而是從實用的過程去說理；（二）科學的作者絕不唯心，也不機械地去展開自己的思想；（三）批判的，不僅是敎科書或類　，處處可看到作者對傳統眞理的取捨和衡量，可是也不偏狹；此外，更値得贊揚的是作者的行文，那麼流利，那麼多趣，決不像一般理論書寫的枯燥。為了這些　點和介紹於他人的熱切必要，故雖則本書現在是再版了，為了初版未曾暢懷地銷過，然而仍朧是新　得使每一未讀過的人急於一讀為快的一本有意思的書。羅曼羅蘭傳  楊同芳　　著譯者：威光頭遜著·沈鍊之譯　　出版處：文化生活出版社　　出版期：三十六年王月初版　　羅曼羅蘭是近代思想界的先驅，他的思想的光輝照耀着世界每個角落。我舞所需要瞭解的羅曼羅蘭可說是多方面的，因爲他不僅是一個偉大的歷史學者，傳記作家，劇作家，同時也是法國絕代的詩人和先知，更是超越的思想家和勇敢的和平主義者。　　要想從這些方面去認識這位時代的人傑，最近出版的「羅曼羅蘭傳」該是値得我們一續的。原作者美國威爾遜（Ronald　A．Wilson）對羅氏思想有精湛的研究，他把平日所寫的關於這位大思想家的專題研究，編成g　本集子,雖是幾篇可以各自獨立的文章，但却有着一貫的思想，從這裏面我們不難窺探到一個劃時代的思想家一生苦鬥的經過。　　全音共分九章：第一章「早年的生活」，第二章「初期的劇作」，第三章「貝多芬傳」，第四章「米開蘭裝羅傳」，第五章「託爾撮泰傳」，第六章「羅曼羅蘭：學者和詩人」，第七章「羅曼羅蘭的英雄」，第八章「英維傳記和約翰，克利斯托夫」，第九章「羅曼羅蘭和新理想主義」。附錄「羅曼羅蘭給美國友人的兩封信」。每篇叙述都很淸利活潑，能抓住羅氏思想的精髓，可以當作羅氏的生活史看，也可以當作羅氏的創作史看。常人只浮淺的以一個普通的作家看羅氏，實則羅氏的作品正是他思想與生活鬥爭的反映。從他平年的生活一直到晚年他始終追求一個崇高的生活理想。誠如塞舍（A．Seche）所說，他的生活滲透着良心和道總的力量，他　而不捨地爲實現他的售仰——　美，愛　，愛生活而努力。是的，羅氏的　　威就是够偉大的，他的每一種作品都充滿着生命的活力。　　　　　蘭是近世　國文壇上　樣最大的）位傳記作家，雖然他也寫過不少的戲劇，散文和詩，以他的思想的　　却可以幾本名震世界的傳記為代表。　氏寫　記不使在作歷史的考據，而是在顯示一個傳記人物的偉大的個性和情操，他把傳記人物的數個生活形態，通過極精確的觀察而　寫出來，他是其於一纖對於生活與思想的信仰和愛慕而創作的，所以條種作品都能深切地抓住人們的心，生動而有力，明快而眞切，使人讀了無不大受感動。　　我覺得羅氏一生包括着一個對思想和生活職鬥的過程，他的作品充滿着對人類的熱愛。他歌頌人類的精神美和思想美，社會上的一切罪惡，必須以精神美和思想美去補救它，惟自由和民主能造成人類的和諧與社會的進步。羅氏傳記作品的藝術價値，尤表現於人物生活中細行徵節，往往避開一般歷史家所寫的那些顯著的行動。從瑣層的日常生活中，即一言一語，亦可使人發生內心的激動。　　羅曼羅蘭的早年生活，已經孕育着產生後來偉大思想的種籽，恬靜而優美的生活環境，讓他有沈思默想的機會。童年的音樂教養，滋潤了他寂寞的心情，就　着音樂這樣最美的語言，净化了他的思想，激勵了他的志趣，音樂給予他一種很大的生命之力，後來他從事創作，不管傳記或者劇作都可說是受了這種力量的影響。誰都知道羅氏是對人類懷着一顆無比的愛心，他咀咒社會罪惡，呼籲人類合作，這種偉大的啟示，照他自己說確是由於曾樂的涵養所致。音樂能流露眞理，表達人類共同的要求，從情感上使人與人之間擭得深切的同　與了解。　　當我體完成爾遜的這本「羅曼羅蘭傳」後，把我偏狹的思想和感情升華而為一種對人類的樹往和期望。羅曼羅蘭的思想是屬於人民的，全人類的。他的新理想主義，摧毀了人世間一切卑鄙和自私，腐惡和陰毒，他帶人類走向一個歷史的新的階段，以創造性的詩人的筆觸，建立人類普遍的友愛。他的生活理想是何等祟高，他的創作目的是何等偉大！　　羅曼羅蘭這個名字，有人說它是自由思想的象徵。他的生活是戰鬥的，勇敢的，從不向命運低頭，只知道不斷的和生活的黑晴面桃戰。他認為人們惟有生活在苦難中，才能找到生命的甘泉。從他給美國友人的信裏，更可以看出他是一個怎樣忠於人生忠於創作的領導人類走向新世紀的歷史學家，思想家，詩人。　　在舉世擾攘不寗的現階段，人類的猜忌和仇恨，並沒有隨第二次大戰而蕩除。我們很痛惜這位劃時代的思想　前驅的逝世。他的祖國總算從納粹的奴役下掙扎出來了，然而他却悄悄地離開人世，這真使人愴懷無已。　　因此我把這本「羅曼羅蘭傳」介紹給愛好正義　和平的人土。它雖不是一本煌煌巨著，但威爾遜的文筆倒充滿着優美的文藝情趣，看來並不使人感到枯燥，而沈鍊之的譯文，也能做到灌鍊典雅，有一纖詩的氣氛從字行間潘當出來，這是很値得一讓的。評「社會月刊」  進文　　發行者：社會月刊社（上海林森路社會局內）　　主編人；袁文彰　　定價；每期二千元　　這是上海市社會局各主管部門，發表業務報告，刊載社曾法令，研討社會問題，分析社會事象的一種期刊。從卅五年七月五日創刊起，到現在已至二卷三期，綜觀各期內容，深覺這份「社會月刊」，是値得一評的。　　社會行政，在我國是新的行政；社會事業，是現代化的一種事業；而社會問題森羅萬象，又是今天最重要，最與每個人發生切盧之痛的問題。可是檢討社會行政，社會事業，研究社會問題的刊物，在今天獨付闕如，在過去，曾有社會學的研究雜誌，但學院派氣味太重，鮮論實際問題。而「社會月刊」，在今天確呼是唯一研討社會行政，社會事業，社會問題的刊物。這月刊雖為官方所辦，然毫無公報意味，這是可貴的。所以它能始終保特活潑的風格，平實的態度。　　至於內容方面，根據我所讀到的九期來說，是優劣互見，茲略分述如下：　　關於「社會月刊」內容優點方面：一·資料價値較高。該刊每期論文，均有資料性的論著，材料力求徵信，叙述提要鈎元，資料價値確不差。如各月「上海市勞資爭議統計」，「上海市出版界的動向」，「上海市人力重夫互助會之過去與現在」，「上海市社會局沿革」諸篇，大多可供社會學者的研究參考。二·業務報告和施政方針，在該刊內充分表露，可使讀者對於上海市社會行政，及社會政業的瞭解。三·法規及附錄，皆刊重要的法令規章，編制醒目，檢閱便利，無一般政務公報之繁瑣。使利讀者的參考。　　關於「社會月刊」缺點方面：一。有關上海市社會調查的研究報告缺少；二·銓釋社會行政法規的論文缺少，過去社會法令，如「社會救濟法」「國民義務勞動法」，及現在審議中的「工會法」，都値得銓解，甚有利於讀者及社會行政人員之參考，該刊缺少這些，實美中不足；三·有關社會學理和社會政策的論文，稍欠充分。我相信……個水準相常高，注重社會行政的實際效用底刊物，不應有此缺點的。　　根據全般內容的檢討，「社會目刊」確乎不失為有價値的刊物，編纂嚴盛，內容平實，資料徽信，則為其重要的特點，特向讀者介紹。至於我所說的缺點，乃個人一得之見，如有必要，希望編者在內容上，作進一步的充實「白癡」  石碚　　陀司妥也夫斯基著　耿濟之譯　開明版　　一八六七年，陀司妥也夫斯基為着要逃避貪婪的債鬼的追逼，他帶了新結婚的妻子到外國旅行，經過四年旅途的生活，他完成了「白癡」和「惡靈」兩大不朽的長篇小說。　　「白癡」是敍述一個年靑的公爵梅思金，和兩個少女戀愛的故事。小田主的孤女娜司泰謝，因為她失身於羅果靜而變成了一個可憐的自暴自棄的女人，這使公爵對她，發生了一種幾乎像宿命般憐憫的愛戀。同時，當公爵到了葉潘欽將軍家裏去以後，他又被將軍的女兒阿格拉耶嬌媚的愛力所撮住了；他是一個驕傲純潔的處女，他們相見不久。便摯熱地戀愛起來。因此梅思金公爵夾在這兩個女人熟　當中，他不知應該怎樣辦寧好；一個是近乎狂熱的愛，一個是溫　體貼的　　，二直曲節地演變至最　，正當公爵決定和娜司泰謝，舉行結婚典禮的時候，不幸的娜司泰謝被羅果靜劫走殺害了。在這事發生之前，將軍的女兒阿格拉耶已變成一個瘋狂的人，結果公爵也完全陷入精神的錯亂中。這悲劇的收塲，了結這一段以心和心之間的糾紛與錯綜的戀愛故事。　　「白癡」雖然是一部纖愛的小說，但是陀司妥也夫斯基並不是用人類官能上的愛之需要為出發，而是提取了世間人與人的互相關係的問題，生活痛苦和良心善惡的問題為觀點，以這些綫索結成了現實生活的另一面，深刻而明瞭地接觸到人生的本質。使我們讀後，對書中的人物，無形中產生了一種深沉的同情心。所以「白癡」的結構，能給我們有特殊高度的啟示，它和別的通常的戀愛小說，有着很大的分別。　　在這本書裏，陀司妥也夫斯基寫下光芒銳利的文彩，使我感動的塲面很多，其中尤以在刑塲上面臨着死亡時的實感，和被癲癇病發作時所侵襲的瞬間內心體騐，都有很詳細深入的刻劃，這是不可多得的寳貴的寫實文筆。　　因為正在一八四九年的期間，陀司妥也夫斯基因參加白特拉雪夫斯基組織的團體，得到「思想上的陰謀」之罪名被捕，其實這個團體並沒有什麼積極行動的計劃，只不過是集一些靑年們，以研究討論一般社會思想為目的的結合。但是專制橫暴的尼古拉一世，對這些「自由思想家」毫不放鬆，在那年年底，陀司妥也夫斯　與同遭被捕的友人，被判處死刑。他們都已經下了悽愴的決心，滿以為幾分鐘後，便要死了，　　他們正徬徨在生死之間，　帝的　令突然改變了，將死刑减處為流　。陀可妥也夫斯基親受到　種可怕的薪激，他的心裏永埋着　刻的記憶。並且陀司妥也未　蕊本人，是思有　癎病，這是伴着他一生中最大的不幸。「白癡」便是他藉着書中主人公梅思金公爵的生活，述說了他以上兩種不幸的情緒感覺，發揮得淋漓盡緻，深深打動了讀者的心坎。　　「白癡」裏的梅思金公爵，陀司妥也夫斯基是想把他創造成一個柔和而謙遜的眞正完美的人‘物，他有那麼純眞的心靈，和那麼樸素净化的性格，然而他被別人認作為白癡了；雖然如此，但他單純的孩十般的濬智，却以光明和友愛的精神去慰籍所有與他接觸的人。作者用這種描寫的手法，是很圓滿且是成功的表現。　　讀了這本書，我曾默然地在想，我們生活在今天欺昨哄騙的趨向逆流的社會裏，不知有多少價正善良的人，被別人當作「白癡」；相反的，不知又有若干無惡不作的人，被人象崇為「聖人」？讀了這本不朽的巨著的鑽者們，或許總會生出無限的感　吧自由談禁舞與大防  羅比　　參政會開幕至閑幕，均是大軸，唯緊張嚴肅之閒我們曾聽到一次輕鬆的笑聲，看到一個風趣的塲面，那就是張之江參政員之提議禁舞。　　禁舞與跳舞在我國似論之已久，不過前此有人倡議禁舞，為的是節的與風化，而這次張氏之倡言禁舞，則要更嚴肅一點了，曰：大防。　　男女大防的提論，似成絕響已久但是有心如張氏，看到「男女交際舞授受而親，且舞時男女相抱，纏綿廉擦，非惟撤除社漸防微，且大開方便之門」，終究難以容忍，不甘緘默。　　跳舞之在我國，流於聲色的娛悅，這是事寳。「不知引誘多少人迷戀而不克自拔」，也確為經見。今日未成年之學生挾書包以上跳舞塲，就是十分普通的現象。不過「為保障中華民國之體面，應予嚴禁」，却有點言重了。這不祇是由於跳舞無關面子問題，而且男女交際舞亦非國產而為東漸的歐風之一，在爵士音樂中恐怕外人比國人更能習慣成自然的。　　跳舞本身無罪，故矯正今日舞風之不良現象則可，以之阻塞男女正常交際就未免因噎廢食了。言大防，百十年前可謂盛矣，但是留給我們多少後花園之類的故事，此所以男女分校之說也已在今日被專家們所抨擊了。　　男女之間唯其不防，方能大防，這是相反而相成的事理。如以百十年以前的道德標準以衡量今日，也是不合理的。至於病跳舞之入戀愛，那難道今日還應該是憑媒婚嫁的時代？　　雖說今之跳舞與前之「聞谿起舞」之「舞」是相去極遠的，但是就跳舞之本身言，祇是一種正當的交際，而並未奢望其爲技藝之訓練。當今日我男女之間的社會關係尚未盡合理以前，作爲正當社交之跳舞尚值得維護，我以爲。神秘的雙生子  新子譯　　研究雙生子的專家說，雙生子不僅是身體和面貌相似，就是他們每人所走的人生之路，雖因環境而大有不同，但其對於遭遇的反應，却往往有驚人的不可思議的雷同的地力。　　我們深知每個人的器官的壽命，在母胎中已經注定，有些專家從一羣自五十歲至八十歲的雙生中，得到一種有趣的事實，就是說雙生子每人的身體的變化都顯然很相同，甚至他們頭上的第一根白髮頭會同時生出在同一地方。至於禿頭的形狀也會一致的　　伏脫敎授細心觀察，十九對雙生子十的成長的情形，他發現每對雙生子的額上面頰上，口上眼上皮膚的縐絞都是相同的，他們的牙齒會同時變壞，不管他們所住的地方距離有多遠，其中一倆受到痛苦或遇到不幸的事情，另一個也會同時受到影響。這種常常發現的事實，已成為這間題中最神秘的現象了。　　英國會經報導關於湯姆斯史禿克一對雙生子的事情，陽姆斯是一個五歲的孩子，他住得離曼徹斯特不遠，他和一羣，小孩正在忙碌的張起一個帳幕，其中一個年長的孩子想用斧頭把木椿釘入地下，當他把斧頭舉起凖備用力衡擎木樁的時候，却不幸的傷了站在後面的湯姆斯的左眼，馬上他被送到醫院裏，醫生替他的眼睛施行手術，不料，幾個鐘點以後，他的雙生兄弟威廉也覺得左眼疼痛，而且睡了起來，便也趕快的請了醫生來看，後來，他們的父親說·他們兩兄弟可以在同時得到同樣的耳痛牙痛或其他類似的疾病。　　還有一件奇事，是一個靑年正在家裏走着的時候，忽然覺得頭部劇痛，不久，便暈迷了過去，廿四小時以後，他才知道當他頭部一疼痛時，雙生兄弟在另一個城布從馬上跌了下來，頭部受着重傷。　　巴黎的報上也載過一對雙生兄弟同時死亡的事，這對雙生子之一是木雕家，他在離巴黎不遠的森林中散步時，突然暈死了。而他的雙生兄弟也在森林裏同樣死掉。意大利的巴爾丁尼三個孿生兄弟更給科學家許多資料，其中一個兄弟在羅馬因汽軍肇事而死，一兩個鐘點以後，第二個兄弟不知其第一個已死因心臟墮落而死同天晚上，第三個兄弟死在米蘭，而且也是心鐵病。　　宇宙是神秘的，這雙生子的事實也是神秘的，究竟到什麼時候我們才能發　這一切的紳秘　人種歧視  吳德潤　　聯合社於紐約約曾發出下述通訊：南美卡羅里　州佫林纖爾城，白種人將黑種人　　愛爾私刑處死一案，被告三十一人，經當地法院宣告無罪記關釋，美國南部各州白種人，　　歡欣，但世界各地，均視為「狂暴審判」。　　在文明先進的國家，竟有這等事，堂崑發生，的確是件新聞，也是件不可思議的奇事。被告都已承認行兇，而竟仍判無罪開釋，除了根據「人種的賣　」的「不成文法」外，眞是無可再爲解釋的了。　　　然，這對白種人，是會感，到歡欣。但我以爲那祇是一小　份無智　者的見界，而歡欣也許是倖偉而日。因比，除了倫敦每日快報感　：「狂共審判」仍爲美國之「不成文法」外，南部各州之　　，亦多表不滿。亞特倫達報稱：國民之良心已受震動；此政府之判決。　區門時報稱：整個國家均將因此判決而蒙　，梅菲商報稱：此爲美國南部司法之悲慘日子。白明罕先軀報稱：　部人士，亦有為之增加感想。　　然而，在文明先進國家，階級歧　消滅後，人羅歧視依舊有在，而又堂堂引用作司法宣判，怎不撩人沉思，感喟！日本人的死  陳中繩　　日本人的死至今還是光怪陸離。在土地木郡有一個五十三歲的老頭兒森田本一，因為競選坂澤村議會，大敗他的一名摯友，他為了表示拘歉起見，就毅然自刎。谷村地方上週有一個呌做四村谷雪的，為了他所支持的地方選舉候選人名落孫山，傷感過度，終至斷舌自殺。在犯罪淵藪東京，有一個廿四歲的荒井關，把自己投身在火車下，因為「投身警界，發現世事腐化，變卦多端，訓身為警察於亂世，不如一死。」　　據日本內務及運輸省的公報，去年有一千二百四十一個日本人，為了某種緣故用同一方法企圖自殺，其中成功的有九百七十人，東京有一個前任傘兵的粟山完造，上月中囊空如洗，就從八十一一呎高的浴室烟囱上躍下以求一死，據東京醫察署報告：「此人前經傘兵訓練，且烟囱下餘燼溫柔，故未能遂其壯志。」文安獄——讀史雜記之四  蕭黛　　　　這里先說一說明太祖朱元璋的出身。　　明史云：　　「太祖……高島帝諱元璋，字國瑞，姓朱氏。先世家沛，徙句客，再徙泗州。父世珍，始徙　州之鍾離，生四子，太祖其季也。……至正四年，旱，蝗，大　疫，太祖是年十七，父母兄相　歿；……太祖失依，乃入皇覺寺為儈，逾月，遊食合肥……三年復還寺。當是時，元政不綱，盜賊四起……十三年春……太祖收里中兵，得七百人，子興（郭子興）喜，署為鎭撫。……」　　以一個和尙出身的人，能够統一天下，做起大明帝國的皇帝來，畢竟不是容易的一件事。上台之後，自然要想迭穩固這一已得的至尊之位，於是一方面不許宗藩有治權，同時在政府方面就盡力提高其專制權威。凡對此權威有侮辱之嫌者，格殺勿論。　　明太祖的「猜忌好殺」」是令人驚駭的。廿二史剳記胡藍之獄有云：「獨至明宜，藉功臣以取天下，及天下旣定，即盡舉取天下之人而盡殺之，其殘忍實千古所未有，蓋雄猜好殺本其天性。」明太祖屠殺了文武功臣不算，而且還殺戳　書人。這祗要看一看明初的文字之禍即可知其大概了。　　明太祖諱「則」，藍「則」音近「賊」也；諱「生知」，嫌音近「僧」也；諱「帝扉」，嫌於「帝非」也；諱「法坤」，嫌於「髮髡」也……當時以嫌疑見法者，不可勝計。閒中今古錄戰：　　「杭州敎授徐一　，賀表有「光」天之下天「生」聖人，為世作「則」等語，帝覽之大怒曰：「生」者僧也，以我嘗為僧也；「光」則雜髮也，「則」字音近賊也。遂斬之。禮臣大懼，因請降表式，帝乃自為文播天下。又僧來復謝恩詩有「殊域及自慚，無德頌陶唐」之句，帝曰：汝用「殊」字，是謂我為歹朱也，又言「無德頌陶唐」，是謂我無德，雖欲以陶唐頌我而不能也。遂斬之。」　　這倒很有些像阿Ｑ，因為自已是「　痢」，就諱人家說「壳」，說「光」這些字眼，而對於說亮說光的這些人，是一樣深惡而痛嫉之的。像這機的吹毛求疪，有意殺人，降至滿淸，更　本加厲。文字之獄，綿亙了數期。　　例如明天啟問，湖州李國楨著明史槪（又名明書），其論贊稱朱史氏，後為淸人莊廷範得之，於順浩十七年刊行於世。至十八年，為人告發，遂將全書編纂人及昆弟子女全數斬決，株連的近一百人。平望志載：　　「果愧庵名炎，潘力田名　章，才望相埒。康熙癸卯二月（永歷十七年。即公元一六六三年）。同以南潯莊氏史獄株通，遠　虎林軍營。是歲五月五日，吳潘俱磔於杭之弼敎坊，同死者七十餘人。遣戍者百餘人。」　　再如浙人呂留眞，因倡民族主義，著書排滿，其文中有詩云：「淸風雖細難吹我，明月何嘗不照人？」於雍正五年為四川總警岳鍾琪報告當局，遂起大獄。結果，呂留泉及其長子呂葆中，弟子嚴鴻達等均因已死，加戰屍之處罰，留良次子呂毅中處斬，其餘日氏子孫，均發往寗古塔為奴，婦女入官。　　明淸兩代，對於讀書人殘忍的殺戮是一樣的，不過其目的稱有不同。前者是要鞏固自已的專制權威，而後者則在肅淸排滿思想。所以懂得「明哲保身」的讀書人，乾脆就關起門來，興六朝時一樣研讀研讀老莊哲理了。淸代考據學的突興，原因即在此。危城記  秦瘦鷗　　「可是，別忘了，你是獨生子呢！」張昌所列舉的理由實際上老祝也未嘗不知道，並且他也承認這些理由是對的，但他總不忍通累張昌。　　「死生有命，老祝，別把我看得那麼嬌生慣養的！」胆子大，脾氣也大的張　很激昂地說。　　「那末，很好，旣然你不惜命要交我這個朋友，我還有什麼說的？」老祝略帶」些廉笑的神氣說。說。緋緋椡也有着她老子一樣倔强的個性，老祝向她說了許多好話，毫無結果，後來還是蘭把她呌過去，軟哄了一陣，才使她苔憑跟老祝一起走。　　將起身時，老祝又再三叮囑張昌，敎他千萬注意，別讓自已也染上了病，同時還把獨山，　勻，貴　各地可以利用的通信處也逐一給他寫了出來，要他隨降設法打電話或託人帶信。　　廬前也　眉苦臉地走過去，用很快的言不發，祇嘆口類便又走開了。張昌接過一瞧，原來就是盧跛子常帶的那只金戒指，大家時常取笑他指為結婚戒的。老說也看見了，望着他的後影笑了一笑。　　「窮朋友都是好的！」他自語一樣的說。　　張昌躊躇了一下，終於把那戒指藏進了自已的衣袋去。「盧跛子這個人是牛性，跟他抝不得的。並且胡太太的病太凶，說不定　需要躭攔許多日子。回頭你謝謝他吧！」他向老祝說。　　老祝遺　點頭。　　關是由兩位男團員用一張震椅　着來的，那個司機見了，　一些又想反悔；經祝兆年和張昌再三麗說，才以「只搭到河池，無論如何，不准再上去」然條件，勉　　　了。說謊　　法官：「你知道在法庭上說謊的後果嗎？」　小姑娘：「我知道的，我的律師曾經說過。」　　「他怎麼說？」　「他告訴我，說謊可以佔便宜，使案子勝訴的。」</p>

<h3>Severe Drought in North China; Agricultural Harvests Cause for Concern</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] North China has experienced a severe drought since spring, and northern agricultural production is facing a serious crisis. Feng Zefang, director of the Beiping Cotton Production Improvement Office, said: This year, a widespread drought has occurred in various provinces in the north, especially during the planting season in March, April, and May. There was no rain in Beiping in April, and 1.2 millimeters in May. Only 19.8 millimeters of rain fell on the evening of the 28th in southern Hebei. Even if it rains again in the future, it will not be of great use, because the agricultural season has already been missed. The wheat is approaching the harvest period, and many cotton seedlings have withered. Feng looked frequently at the snowless sky outside the window and told reporters that this year's drought is unprecedented in more than 30 years, only comparable to 1914. Not only are cotton fields severely affected, but other crops are also affected during their growing period. This year's agricultural output is truly cause for concern.</p>
<h3>National Economic Commission to Meet Next Week; Discuss Collection of Property Tax; Concrete Measures to Be Decided for Balancing the Budget; 350,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Arriving Sequentially</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The collection of property tax is imperative. The National Economic Commission will hold a meeting on the 10th to conduct concrete discussions on this and may make some decisions. It is heard that some people in the government advocate that local public opinion institutions should compile a list of wealthy families to serve as the target for taxation, but there may be some technical difficulties in this matter. It is also heard that the future property tax will adopt a one-time property tax method and adopt a progressive system, with those with more property paying more tax.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] At the last meeting of the National Economic Commission, it was decided on the economic emergency measures plan to推推定 members be divided into five groups for balancing the budget: (1) military expenses, (2) food, (3) finance, (4) the sale of state-owned enterprises and enemy and puppet properties, and (5) the reduction of general government agency expenses, to study in detail ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. It is understood that the first group held a meeting on the 3rd and submitted a report, the fifth group is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 6th, and the other three groups will also be held this week. The opinions of the working groups will be summarized and discussed at the meeting on the 10th to determine effective policies and concrete measures.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The government has concrete assurance in solving the rice problem. Starting this month, 350,000 tons of foreign rice will be shipped to China sequentially, which is expected to be completed in four months. It is estimated that it can at least solve the one-year needs of 6 million people in coastal cities. Of this 350,000 tons of foreign rice, 50,000 tons are shipped from various places in Southeast Asia, and the remaining 300,000 tons are purchased with funds allocated by the United States to aid China. After the foreign rice arrives, it will be universally distributed to public school teachers, military personnel, and laborers in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places so that they will not be oppressed by food prices, and rice prices in various places can also be suppressed as a result. The proceeds from the sale of foreign rice purchased with U.S. relief funds will be used to fill the relief fund. Furthermore, in order to prevent a sharp drop in rice prices due to the arrival of a large amount of foreign rice, which would affect farmers, the authorities will not adopt a method of large-scale distribution in the market.</p>

<h3>Government Official Disciplinary Committee Decides to Reprimand Bei Zuyi; Wang Songtao Dismissed and Suspended from Employment for One Year</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The case of Bei Zuyi, the former president of the Central Bank and key figure in the gold speculation case, and Wang Songtao, the former assistant manager and head of the cashier's office of the Central Bank's Business Bureau, for illegal dereliction of duty, was previously submitted by the Control Yuan to the Government Official Disciplinary Committee for review by the National Government. The review has now been completed and it has been resolved that Bei Zuyi be reprimanded and Wang Songtao be dismissed and suspended from employment for one year. The full text of the resolution is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text</p>
<p>Bei Zuyi: Reprimand; Wang Songtao: Dismissal and suspension from employment for one year.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>In February of the 36th year of the Republic of China, when price fluctuations were severe and had a significant impact on people's livelihoods, the Control Yuan ordered members He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wan Can to jointly investigate whether the Central Bank had improper measures and other circumstances in executing the gold trading business. The investigation revealed that Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, director of the Business Bureau, Yang Anren, deputy director, and Wang Songtao, assistant manager and head of the cashier's office, had the following illegal acts and dereliction of duty: (1) The gold reserve base of the Central Bank is related to state organs and has a significant impact on the future of the gold policy. However, Bei Zuyi, the president of the bank, and others sold all the gold bars and handed them over to Tongfengyu Gold Firm to be responsible for distribution, and the seven gold firms like Dafengheng melt into gold bars, instead of handing it over to the Central Mint for melting. The quantity of melting amount by Central Bank, and Tongfengyu knew it clearly. Then the central bank's designated five firms must be signed by Zhan Liansheng, the host of Tongfengyu Gold Firm, before they can be picked up. Therefore, the total amount of gold sold by the Central Bank was fully known by Zhan Yunsheng, and it was not difficult to use this total amount to infer the amount of gold stored by the Central Bank and take the opportunity to fight a speculative battle with the gold policy to obtain huge profits. Bei Zuyi and others are suspected of deliberately泄　this secret. (2) The Central Bank designated five firms, including Tongfengyu, to be responsible for selling gold. The daily gold price was determined based on the reports of the five firms and the Central Bank's phone calls. The designation of the five firms was arbitrarily decided by Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, and Yang Anren without any standards. Moreover, these five firms were all introduced by Zhan Yunsheng, which obviously allowed Zhan Liansheng to control and manipulate them. It is not an exaggeration to call it collusion between officials and merchants. (3) The Central Bank secretly sold gold bars, distributing them to the five firms for free disposal. This secret sale strategy was not decided by the government and should be a method determined arbitrarily by Bei, Lin, and Yang. (4) Reviewing the number of gold bars sold by the five gold distribution firms, there are dozens of entries listing the number of gold purchased by Central Bank personnel, totaling over a hundred bars. Even Wang Songtao, who managed the gold勯cun, also purchased gold bars. Bei Zuyi did not impose any restrictions, which is suspected of allowing his subordinates to engage in gold speculation and trading. (5) Since the beginning of January this year, as gold prices gradually rose and the gold policy could no longer be supported, Bei Zuyi and others did not　report the facts and formulate better methods, but delayed until February 10 to suddenly announce the suspension of gold distribution, causing gold prices to skyrocket and become impossible to拾, and shifting the responsibility for the suspension, which is extremely illegal. Based on the above facts, a proposal for impeachment was made, requesting that Bei Zuyi, the president of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, the director of the Business Bureau, Yang Anren, the deputy director, and Wang Songtao, the assistant manager, be all transferred to the disciplinary committee. The case was established after review by members Jin Yu　, Wang Zixian, and Yu Shude and was presented to the National Government by the Control Yuan for delivery to the committee.</p>
<p>Reasons</p>
<p>The parts of the case involving the impeached persons Lin Fengbao and Yang Jiaren have been approved by the Shanghai District Court, according to a letter from the Secretariat of this committee. Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren have been transferred to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters by the Garrison Headquarters due to a corruption case, and are currently under trial. The facts of their prosecution are roughly the same as the facts recorded in the impeachment case, so the disciplinary proceedings cannot be initiated according to law. The parts of the case involving the impeached persons Bei Zuyi and Wang Songtao are investigated separately as follows: (the following text turns to page two)</p>
<h3>News Bureau Cables Security Authorities in Various Locations to Ensure the Safety of Journalists; Director Dong Answers Questions at a Reception</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] Recently, there have been several arrests of news professionals in various locations. At a press conference held by the News Bureau on the 4th, someone asked Dong Xian Guang what the News Bureau's opinion was on this matter. Dong replied that two days prior, the News Bureau had already telegraphed security and police authorities in various locations, requesting that they ensure the freedom and safety of journalists. After the student unrest subsides, they will further consult with local authorities.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing 4th Dispatch] The News Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 4th, personally presided over by Director Dong Xian Guang. The following is a record of Director Dong's answers to various questions from reporters:</p>
<p>Question: It is widely rumored that the government attaches particular importance to preventing the strikes and class boycotts of June 2nd. Is it truly necessary to take preventative measures against the aforementioned movements?</p>
<p>Answer: According to information obtained by the government in advance from various sources, a well-organized strike and class boycott demonstration with malicious intent was planned to be launched in major cities across the country on June 2nd. The aim was to create disturbances, thereby developing into bloody riots. Therefore, the government had to take emergency preventative measures.</p>
<p>Students Were Alert in Time, June 2nd Passed Safely</p>
<p>The crisis was averted mainly due to three factors: (1) Students across the country were able to understand the greater good and were alert in time; (2) School authorities, as well as the Political Consultative Council, the Legislative Yuan, and other public opinion organs, mediated and persuaded, achieving significant success in averting the situation; (3) Local authorities took emergency actions, arresting Communist Party members and others who participated in the activities either automatically or blindly.</p>
<p>Question: It is said that the June 2nd demonstration plan was orchestrated behind the scenes by the Communist Party. What is Director Dong's opinion on this?</p>
<p>Answer: Communist Party conspiracies are most easily carried out in places where thoughts are mixed and economic difficulties exist. All countries that have suffered long-term war have this common experience. Therefore, the recent student movement was quickly exploited by the Communist Party as a tool to disrupt public order and endanger the government. You must all remember that June 2nd was the day the Chinese Communist Party launched the so-called "Anti-Civil War Movement" in Yan'an last year.</p>
<p>Question: Has the policy of arresting so-called Communist Party members by local authorities been approved by the Executive Yuan in advance? Will the arrested students and journalists be tried publicly? Does the government agree to send the arrested Communist Party members back to the Communist-controlled areas?</p>
<p>Answer: After the peace talks broke down, the government explicitly ordered all Communist Party personnel to return to the Communist-controlled areas before May 5th. Therefore, local authorities do not need to seek further instructions from the Executive Yuan before arresting Communist Party members. Students and journalists arrested in cities under martial law will be interrogated by the local military authorities.</p>
<p>Question: How many students nationwide have been arrested due to activities in recent weeks? How many journalists or newspaper editors have been arrested?</p>
<p>Answer: Arrests have occurred in several cities due to recent student demonstrations. Some have been detained after arrest, while others have been released quickly. Therefore, there are no accurate figures to report. Approximately eighty Communist Party members and those acting in concert with the Communist Party have been arrested in Shanghai, including students and journalists. More than twenty students were detained in Hankou and have since been released after interrogation.</p>
<p>Question: How many students have died in the recent disturbances, and where did they die? Please inform us.</p>
<p>Answer: Other than the three students in Hankou, there have been no deaths in other locations.</p>
<p>Question: Can you list the names of Chinese cities that have been under martial law since last week?</p>
<p>Answer: Shanghai has not been declared to be no longer under martial law since the State Council declared martial law in November of the 34th year of the Republic. According to Article 3 of the Martial Law Act, the highest military commander in a city or region close to a war zone may declare martial law at any time when public security is threatened. The recent declarations of martial law in Peiping and Tianjin are examples of this. Although Communist Party personnel withdrew from Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places on April 5th, their underground operatives did not withdraw at the same time and have recently been plotting riots in various places. The government has obtained evidence, so it must conduct searches and detentions in order to send them to the Communist-controlled areas.</p>
<p>US Surplus Materials Expected to be Shipped Continuously</p>
<p>Question: What is the current status of the shipment of US surplus materials to China?</p>
<p>Answer: To date, the Chinese government has received surplus materials worth approximately US$20 million, mainly trucks. The transfer of US surplus materials to China is based on the contract signed by former President Song and the US in August of the 35th year of the Republic. The US government agreed to ship materials worth over US$500 million to the Chinese government within 20 months from the date of signing the contract. However, due to the lack of transportation, the US has only delivered a small portion of the total amount to date. The Foreign Liquidation Commission, which is responsible for this matter on the US side, will begin to conclude in July of this year. Therefore, the Chinese government is extremely hopeful that the transferred materials will be shipped continuously. Our Materials Supply Bureau has recently signed contracts with several US shipping companies to transport materials from Guam, Okinawa, and the Mariana Islands to China. Also, these materials stored on the various islands are currently under joint custody by China and the United States.</p>
<p>Question: The Political Consultative Council passed many peace proposals at its recent general assembly. Is the government optimistic about the prospects of this peace movement?</p>
<p>Answer: President Chiang and President Zhang have mentioned the government's desire for peace several times in the past week. However, peace is a two-way street and cannot be achieved by one side alone. At the moment, peace or lack thereof depends entirely on the Chinese Communist Party. While the Political Consultative Council was launching the peace movement, the Communist Party was launching wars in various places. This can be considered the Communist Party's response to the peace movement.</p>
<p>Question: On June 2nd, there was an anti-riot, anti-strike march by the student union in Peking. According to the temporary measures for maintaining social order, marches of more than ten people should be stopped. However, the student union's march was not stopped. How does the government explain this?</p>
<p>Answer: To the best of my knowledge, a small number of people engaged in small group propaganda on that day. There was no march or demonstration, so the government did not stop it.</p>
<p>Question: It is reported that Tianjin has resumed news censorship. Was this under the order of the News Bureau?</p>
<p>Answer: The News Bureau has not issued any orders, nor has the News Bureau received any official reports regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Question: The Political Consultative Council resolved at its recent general assembly to requisition deposits held abroad by Chinese citizens. Has the government drafted any measures for requisitioning?</p>
<p>Answer: It is still under study by the competent authorities.</p>

<h3>Our Wartime Losses Total Over US$31 Billion; Compensation Committee Provides Estimated Figures</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to a statement released today by the Compensation Committee here, the total direct war losses of the Chinese government and private individuals amount to more than US$31 billion. The largest losses were in buildings, farm implements, and private property, totaling US$21.033 billion. These figures are believed to include war damage reports submitted to local governments by various disaster areas after the end of the war. The total losses of industrial and commercial buildings are US$4.053 billion, including Chinese factories removed by the Japanese army in the occupied areas, such as university factories in Shanghai. The committee also stated that losses in agricultural and forestry protection amounted to US$3.976 billion. Losses to public institutions such as hospitals and universities reached US$1.157 billion. The wartime damages listed by the Compensation Committee include the following:</p>
<p>Houses, farm implements, and private property: US$22,000,000,000</p>

<h3>Representatives of Four Powers Inspect Japanese Warships to be Distributed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Tokyo 4th Dispatch] Representatives of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union will inspect a Japanese destroyer and a destroyer escort ship. These two warships are typical of the ninety Japanese naval vessels to be distributed among the four powers. Each of the four powers will receive twenty-three vessels, including six destroyers and seventeen escort ships. The allocation will be done by drawing lots, with the date to be announced by the Allied headquarters.</p>
<h3>US Advocates Early Conclusion of Siamese Treaty with Japan; Preparatory Meeting Expected in Washington</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] Government authorities stated today that if a preparatory meeting for the treaty with Japan is convened, it will likely be held in Washington. San Francisco and Honolulu have also been mentioned as possible locations in the past. While US officials advocate an early conclusion of the treaty with Japan, they do not believe it will be signed before the end of next year. Some individuals feel that the movement to draft a treaty with Japan as soon as possible has spread among the Allied nations, given the United Kingdom's move to convene a meeting of its dominions to discuss policy on the treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Tokyo 4th Dispatch] According to reporters who have learned from the highest levels here, hopes are now increasing daily that an Allied conference on Japan will be convened before the end of this year and that a treaty will be signed in early 1948. Due to recent developments in the United States, powerful organs of public opinion tend to support MacArthur's position, advocating that a treaty be concluded with Japan and followed by the withdrawal of Allied occupation forces. This is considered the most encouraging. Hoover's suggestion, that a treaty be concluded with Japan immediately regardless of the situation in Europe, is particularly welcome here and is considered to accurately reflect the actual situation in the Far East. According to the information obtained by reporters, there are no major difficulties in the treaty with Japan, as there are actually no particularly complex problems that have not yet been resolved. The Potsdam Declaration has stipulated Japan's post-war borders, restricting it to the Japanese mainland, namely Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, Kyushu, and possibly including the adjacent small islands. This declaration itself includes broad provisions that should be included in the treaty in the future. If its spirit and provisions are followed, the work of the treaty-makers will be very easy in terms of fundamental issues. Substantively, people here expect the Soviet Union to continue to retain jurisdiction over the Kuril Islands and Southern Sakhalin, which were allowed to be ceded to the Soviet Union under the Yalta Agreement. The United States will retain control of the Ryukyu Islands (including Okinawa), which will be the main American base in the Far Western Pacific in the future. Although the British Commonwealth Republic, including Australia, differs greatly from the United States in its views on the terms, it is believed that it is extremely hopeful that a treaty with Japan can be concluded as soon as possible. It is expected that the attitude of the British city-states will be formally decided at the upcoming Canberra conference, and there will be an indication of this. Furthermore, people here solemnly point out that the United States has collected compensation figures from China, the Soviet Union, and other Allied nations, estimating its value at US$40 billion, including Japanese property in Northeast China (including Taiwan) taken by the Soviet Union. People here believe that there is still a great hope that the Peace Conference will be held in East China, because the authorized compensation delegations of the main Allied nations have already arrived here, and at the same time, there are experienced personnel and sufficient files to refer to for every conceivable question.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The new Japanese Minister of Finance, Takeda, told our reporter: "It is very important for Japan to convene a peace conference and conclude a treaty quickly. Japan hopes that the Peace Conference can be convened as soon as possible, as the absence of a treaty is the main obstacle to Japan's reconstruction. The Japanese are also willing to pay the compensation that is due, but hope that the Allied nations can strive to maintain enterprises that maintain the most basic level of survival."</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting's Remarks</p>
<h3>Allied Nations Should Supervise Japan Long-Term Until Aggressive Intentions are Eliminated</h3>
<p>[This City News] Mr. Wang Zhengting, a famous figure in our country's diplomacy, expressed his feelings yesterday regarding Japan's repeated display of its ambition towards Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands, strongly advocating that the Allied nations should supervise Japan long-term until the Japanese people's aggressive intentions are completely eliminated. He stated: Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. Therefore, Japan's demands are extremely unreasonable. Regardless of whether its demands can be realized, our country must pay close attention to its development and make full preparations. He believes that the most powerful guarantee of our country's safety is to strive for self-improvement. It is most regrettable that our country's domestic situation is chaotic and unstable, resulting in missed opportunities.</p>

<p>Dong Wenqi Talks About Water Conservancy in the Northeast</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Dong Wenqi took the 11:00 PM express train to Peking yesterday (the 4th) to attend the National Water Conservancy Conference and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in about a week, before going to the Northeast. According to Mr. Dong's statement to reporters, there are two urgent tasks regarding water conservancy in the Northeast: one is the Rao Yang River project. In the hands of the Japanese, it has been completed seven-tenths of the way. However, there has been much damage in the past two years. Therefore, disaster prevention is a concern. Last year, when the flood occurred, the losses in the eight counties along the river exceeded 5 billion national currency units. Therefore, this project must be completed this year. During this trip to Peking, I will consult with the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Executive Yuan on everything, and obtain financial and material assistance. The second is the East Liao River water conservancy project, which was completed eight-tenths of the way during the puppet Manchukuo era. The embankment has been built. After this project is fully developed, it will turn 300,000 acres of wasteland into fertile land, with an annual production of 67,000 tons of rice and 36,000 tons of soybeans. This time, I will take advantage of the National Water Conservancy Conference to present it together, arousing the attention of the people of the country. In addition, the area of the major river basins in the Northeast accounts for more than 90% of the total area of the Northeast, which can be called a water-rich region. During the puppet Manchukuo era, the Japanese had a long-term water conservancy construction plan. North Manchuria was centered on the Songhua River system, and South Manchuria was centered on the Liao River system. The survey work began in 1936, and a ten-year plan was established in 1937, covering everything from flood prevention, afforestation, soil conservation, water storage, flood control, irrigation, and hydropower generation. It was grand and detailed, but it was not fully completed due to the War of Resistance and the Pacific War. In terms of hydropower generation, the Japanese planned to establish 45 power stations in the Northeast, generating a total of 5.85 million kilowatts. Three have been completed, and four are still under construction. During this trip to Peking to attend the conference, I have drafted a proposal for the development of the entire Northeast water conservancy enterprise.</p>
<p>In addition, Peng Jiqun, chairman of Nenjiang Province, also took the same train to Peking with Dong Wenqi yesterday to attend the National Water Conservancy Conference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Sneaks into Fujian Waters; Seized in Weitou Ao; Captain and Crew Detained</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Fuzhou 4th Dispatch] The Xiamen Customs previously seized a Japanese merchant ship, the Daishin Maru, in the waters of Weitou Ao in Yinggang. In addition to handling the cargo according to regulations, the passengers on board, two Fujianese and Taiwanese, were released after being questioned by the Customs. The remaining ship's captain, Shigeharu Shibata, and ten crew members were detained and sent by the Customs to the Xiamen City Government for disposal. Before the Allied nations and Japan have signed a peace treaty, the Executive Yuan previously explained that ships from countries that have not signed a reciprocal treaty are not allowed to sail to our commercial ports. The fact that a Japanese ship has sneaked into our territorial waters is a violation of the law. The Xiamen City Government has telegraphed the province to request instructions.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Death Knell of Democratic Hungary</h3>
<p>It is worth our attention to the recent developments in Europe. The nature of these events is quite serious and may affect the overall global situation. Although we are still in East Asia, because the world is indivisible, we cannot but pay close attention to these developments in Europe: (1) News from Yugoslavia states that it is about to form a Balkan Federation, including Albania, and Macedonia in the back of Greece is also under the control of Yugoslavia, joining the federation under the name of autonomous states. At the same time, according to a telegram from the capital of Yugoslavia, in addition to Bulgarian Prime Minister Ye Liye who has already arrived, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is also reported to have arrived in the capital of Yugoslavia. Furthermore, Marshal Tito issued a statement at this time, believing that the free Balkan people must unite and become a strong whole, and also pointed out that the situation in Greece is full of crises due to the inability to unite. For the sake of joint security, the Balkan Slavs must join hands. (2) The Soviet Union's attitude towards Finland has become stronger, and a new situation is brewing in Finland. (3) A coup d'état occurred in Hungary, and the Hungarian Prime Minister was forced to step down, resulting in a pro-Soviet regime in Hungary. (4) The United States stopped lending to Hungary. (5) US Secretary of State Marshall declared: We should continue to assist Italy, hoping that the new government led by Gasperi will succeed in everything, and the American people have a deep and good interest in the welfare of Italy. From the development of these events, it is not difficult for us to imagine how "power politics" is unfolding in Europe. This situation will undoubtedly continue to develop in Europe, affecting the overall global peace.</p>
<p>What do these events signify? Needless to say, the sharpening of the struggle between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The organization of the Balkan Federation is naturally the result of the United States' increased aid to Greece. This is already very clear in Marshal Tito's speech. However, the so-called Balkan Federation here is not an automatic combination of the Balkan people, but is generated under the control of Yugoslavia. Its purpose is obviously to attempt to exert pressure on Greece and other countries with the strength of the "entire Balkans," so that the entire Balkans can become a Soviet vassal. This pressure is also applied to Finland, and the coup in Hungary has particularly prominent characteristics. Undoubtedly, the occurrence of all these events is clearly indicating that the Soviet Union is attempting to consolidate its power in Eastern Europe, wanting to establish a solid "Iron Curtain" from Finland to Yugoslavia. Behind this Iron Curtain, the Soviet Union absolutely does not allow the existence of any regime that is unfavorable to the Soviet Union. The purpose of organizing the Balkan Federation is this: the purpose of the coup in Hungary is also this.</p>
<p>We do not feel that the coup that occurred in Hungary this time was sudden: what really surprised us was that the Hungarian coup was launched because the Soviet side, based on the statement of the Secretary-General of the Smallholders Party, announced that former Prime Minister Nagy had committed treason. This Secretary-General is now deeply imprisoned by the Soviet side. The Soviet announcement believes that Prime Minister Nagy is guilty of desiring Hungarian democracy, so the Hungarian Prime Minister, who was on vacation in Switzerland, had to resign. With the support of the Soviet side, Qian, the former Army Chief of Staff, Dennis, took office as Prime Minister. The Smallholders Party, as the name suggests, has strong petty-bourgeois connotations: this cannot be harmoniously integrated with political groups that advocate the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was generally expected that a coup would occur in Hungary. But what surprised the world this time was that the Soviet side was always the open director of this coup. The Dennis government, unintentionally, is completely under the control of the Communist Party; and the Communist Party in Hungary, at least so far, is not a majority party. This is why we see that the first measure of the new Hungarian regime is to prepare for elections, so that this new regime, which was seized several times, can have a reasonable legal basis. Undoubtedly, if the election is completed, the pro-Soviet political group will inevitably gain an absolute advantage. This is why the result of the Hungarian coup is the death of Hungary's nascent democracy. For the death of this nascent democracy, the democratic countries of Western Europe cannot but express heartfelt concern. If the United Kingdom and the United States jointly protest to the Soviet Union and interfere in the Hungarian situation, this would be a very natural thing.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch, the Hungarian political crisis was caused by the failure of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The United States and the Soviet Union are gradually estranged from each other, so they are both trying their best to consolidate their positions in Eastern and Western Europe before autumn. Hungary has now become the center of political means. The Soviet Union's actions are aimed at reducing the Hungarian Smallholders Party, which currently holds a majority, to put the Communist Party in an advantageous position. To deal with the Hungarian coup, the United States has no choice but to terminate loans to Hungary and frequently send overtures to Italy, which has now become a pivotal player in the European situation. It is in this sense that we see Secretary of State Marshall's friendly expression towards Italy. How the European situation will unfold in the future is a measure of the strength of the US and Soviet forces. The situations that appear in other parts of the world are closely related to the development of this European situation.</p>
<h3>Pei Tsu-yi Reprimanded: Full Text of the Decision of the Disciplinary Committee for Political Affairs Officials (Continued from the First Edition)</h3>
<p>(1) Regarding the part about Pei Tsu-yi: (1) Disclosing the bottom line of the Central Bank's gold reserves. The statement of defense claimed that the bottom line of the gold reserves, the Central Bank colleagues always absolutely, kept secret, the entire equipment of the Central Mint in Shanghai was destroyed, and had not been rebuilt for a long time, so it was compelled to choose reliable gold shops and silver shops to melt and cast separately, until February 6 of this year, the factory sent a letter stating that the equipment was completed, and could cast 1,000 taels of gold bars every day, which was followed. As for the hands of entrusting gold shops and silver shops to melt gold ingots, it was not entirely handled by Tongfengyu alone, but was divided into two groups, one was Taikangrun, which issued a receipt from the shop, and went to the Central Bank to receive gold ingots, recast them into bars, and sent them to the Central Bank for storage without going through Tongfengyu's hands, one was Tongfengyu, which issued a receipt from the shop to receive them. The distribution of Dafengheng, Hongfengyong, Shengyuanshui, Jiuchengyong, Yangqinghe, Yufayong, Xianghe and other seven gold shops for melting was a nature of sub-entrustment. Tongfengyu was responsible for the total responsibility to the Central Bank for the weight and fineness, so it was issued by its general distribution. Tongfengyu had been buying and selling gold for the Central Bank in Maqian for a long time, with a good reputation. The seven gold shops and silver shops melted gold bars and were included in the Tongfengyu group, and it was responsible for the total responsibility to obtain a fully reliable guarantee to avoid accidents, and there was no selfishness involved. All the gold allocated by the Central Bank was aimed at members of the Silver Shop Industry Rectification Committee and the Gold Industry Association, and the chairman of the Rectification Committee and the directors and representatives of the Association handled the application procedures for buying, without going through Zhan Liansheng's hands. Squabbles were aimed at five gold and silver shops, and the delivery was divided into two groups. Tongfengyu and other four shops were in one group, and Tongfengyu added a certificate. Taikangrun was another group, and the shop was responsible for issuing receipts. All the transactions handled by the shop did not go through Zhan Liansheng's hands. The intention of the defense of the accused person was that the melting of gold ingots and the secret sale of gold were handled by Tongfengyu and Taikangrun in two groups, and they would not be able to know the bottom line of the Central Bank's gold reserves. However, the investigation revealed that only one shop, Tailrun, was in the two groups mentioned by the accused person, and Tongfengyu's group included seven shops, including Yifengheng, for melting gold ingots, and four shops, including Dafengheng, for secretly selling gold. Moreover, the Central Bank designated five shops for lending gold. In addition to Tongyingyu, which was opened by Zhan Liansheng, the other four shops were all introduced by Zhan Yunsheng. Therefore, the original impeachment case stated that Tongliyu knew the total amount of gold melted by the Central Bank, and that the gold allocated to the five shops could only be received after Zhan Yunsheng stamped it. Therefore, it was appropriate to say that there were some disturbances. According to the investigation report of Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen and others, from January 4 to February 15 when the sale was suspended, the Central Bank entrusted five shops to distribute 79,440 gold bars. Tongfengyu accounted for the largest number, exceeding half. Tongfengyu suddenly purchased a large number of gold bars before the government announced the suspension of distribution, and the market price soared. If Tongfengyu did not know the gold reserves, how could it be like this? Even if the accused person did not intentionally disclose the secrets of the Central Bank's gold reserves, he failed to perform his duties well, and it was difficult to shirk the blame for dereliction of duty. (2) The five shops designated by the Central Bank to distribute gold were arbitrarily decided to manipulate, and officials and merchants colluded. Two methods of explicit distribution and secret sale were adopted. Explicit distribution was aimed at the Gold Industry and Silver Shop Industry Associations, and secret sale was aimed at the five designated shops. The gold explicitly distributed was not the responsibility of the five shops, and although the gold secretly sold was directly traded with the Central Bank by the five shops via telephone, whether it could be distributed and the amount of distribution were entirely determined by the Central Bank according to the situation, and were not manipulated by the five shops. The Central Bank sold gold at 10:00 am every day, and used the market quotations reported by gold shops or foreign exchange brokers in Dianqing at 9:00 am on the same day as a reference for determining the distribution price. Before the time, within a few seconds, the gold shops could not obtain contact to try to deceive. As for the secret sale of gold, the five shops contacted the Central Bank separately via telephone, and each transaction was completed. The price of each transaction was entirely determined by the Central Bank based on the market reports obtained at that time. When the prices reported by the five shops were deemed inappropriate, they were not adopted or distributed. The Central Bank took the initiative in determining the gold price every day or even every moment, and did not completely rely on the telephone reports of the five shops. Regarding the selection of Zhan Yunsheng, the chairman of the Gold Industry Association, to serve as the leader, it was because Zhan Liansheng was a legitimate leader in the gold industry, and had a long-term relationship with the Central Bank before the war. Xu Fusun, the chairman of the Gold Exchange, who was the most qualified in the gold industry before the war, also believed that he was reliable. In addition, the Central Bank chose gold shops in order to be practical, reliable and impartial. It should be recommended by the chairman Zhan Liansheng in the members of the association. In order to maintain secrecy, the number of shops handling the business could not be too many. The five shops decided were those who had more gold transactions with the Central Bank before the war, had a longer history, and had a good reputation. The Central Bank chose carefully and was not arbitrarily designated without standards. There was no intention of letting Zhan Liansheng monopolize the operation, and there was no collusion between officials and merchants. The investigation revealed that the accused person's defense on this point was not without considerable reason. However, Tongfengyu, one of the five shops designated by the Central Bank, had not yet obtained a business license (see the record of the interview with Zhan Yunsheng by Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen), and then designated it to distribute gold, and the blame for dereliction of duty could not be shirked. (3) Unauthorizedly determining the secret sale method, and distributing gold bars to the five shops to dispose of freely. According to the defense, the Central Bank's explicit sale of gold was only once a day, and it still failed to take the initiative in controlling the market. In order to comply with the government's policy, referring to the entire market situation, and based on the actual supply and demand, in order to stabilize the gold price at any time, in addition to the explicit distribution, the five designated gold shops and silver shops were used to sell a small number of 20 to 30 bars in installments to meet the needs of the industry and customers. If the market price rises and the needs of the industry and customers increase, the number of sales will also increase to achieve the effect of controlling the market and stabilizing the market price. This distribution method was entrusted to the five shops by the Central Bank at the same time, and the secret was absolutely kept in advance to avoid being used by speculators. This was a necessary promotion for the Central Bank to actively and secretly sell gold to control the market. The shops were acting as agents for customers, and each shop negotiated with the Central Bank to buy and transfer to meet the needs of the industry and customers according to their needs. They were not able to freely dispose of and manipulate the market after purchasing in bulk from the Central Bank. At the beginning of the Central Bank's gold trading, it had been carefully studied, and it was believed that it was necessary to adopt both methods to deal with the market situation and respond accordingly. All distribution situations since March of the Republic of China were reported in writing to President Song of the Executive Yuan every day. The distribution of gold was handled in accordance with the government's intentions, and there was no unauthorized decision. The original impeachment stated that the sudden suspension of distribution on the morning of February 10 did not conform to the facts at the time. The investigation revealed that the accused person's measures to restrict the distribution of gold were necessary in light of the situation, and should not be held responsible for punishment. (4) Allowing subordinates to speculate and trade gold without restraint. According to the defense, in the past, gold was freely traded, and it was not illegal for employees of the national bank to purchase gold from gold shops with their own funds. However, in order to restrain colleagues from avoiding criticism, the person in charge issued a notice to colleagues at the beginning of his tenure in March of the Republic of China, severely warning them of such situations. On May 27, an order was issued to colleagues not to engage in other businesses or handle funds for others, and especially not to use the bank's telephones and other tools to contact the above matters during office hours. If there was any violation, once verified, they would be immediately dismissed, and their direct supervisors should also supervise them at all times. If they knew but did not report, they would all be subject to dismissal. In May of last year, the person in charge found that a consultant's secretary had used the bank's telephone to engage in buying and selling activities, and immediately ordered him to leave the bank. All of the above items are recorded in the bank's files. The investigation revealed that the accused person's defense on this point was not without reason, and that there was no evidence that he had allowed subordinates to speculate and trade gold, and it could be dismissed. (5) Announcing the suspension of gold distribution and shirking responsibility. The defense briefly stated that in late January of this year, there were various speculations in the community about foreign exchange adjustments, and the situation was unstable. The amount of idle funds in the market increased day by day, and the demand for gold increased. The market price rose sharply, and it was difficult to control it purely by the distribution of the national bank. Therefore, he immediately asked President Song for instructions. President Song then convened foreign consultants to discuss and decided to restrict and reduce the amount of sales as appropriate. Therefore, the secret sale was temporarily suspended from February 4, and the actual sales needs of the silver shop industry were still distributed as usual. On the 8th, the rising trend was still severe. On the evening of the same day, the person in charge went to Beijing to ask for instructions on the policy. President Song convened relevant personnel twice to discuss together, and decided to only distribute to silver shops. Therefore, from February 10, it was announced that no distribution would be given to gold shops, but explicit distribution would continue for the silver shop industry. It was not announced to be completely suspended until the Central Government promulgated the emergency economic measures plan on February 16. Zuyi belonged to Zungongling for handling, and did not dare to shirk responsibility. The original impeachment stated that the sudden suspension of distribution on the morning of February 10 did not conform to the facts at the time. The investigation revealed that the accused person's measures to restrict the distribution of gold were necessary in light of the circumstances, and should not be held responsible for punishment.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Wang Songtao: The investigation revealed that the accused person Wang Songtao, in the position of Assistant Manager of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank and Director of the Treasury Department, was in a very important position, and should abide by laws and regulations and serve loyally. However, after repeated warnings from the President of the Bank, he still used his position to purchase gold bars, which was suspected of taking advantage of his position to speculate and profit. According to the defense, he introduced his relative Ma Hongxiang to accompany the staff of Tongfengyu Gold Shop to the gold shop to buy. His name was listed as a buyer in the accounts of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, and he tried to shirk responsibility, which was difficult to believe. The accused person should be subject to the punishment law.</p>
<p>In summary, the accused person Pei Tsu-yi has the circumstances of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Servant Disciplinary Law, and Wang Songtao has the circumstances of Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Member Pei Tsu-yi is resolved according to Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 5 and Article 8 of the same law, and Wang Songtao is resolved according to Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 4 of the same law as the main text.

<h3>Britain Transfers Power to India: Realization Expected in August of this Year: Indian Leaders Call on the People to Live in Peace</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 4th: Governor-General Mountbatten announced in New Delhi today that Britain will hand over power to the two autonomous governments of India and Pakistan on August 15. August 15 is the day the Japanese army surrendered. Mountbatten pointed out that the purpose of this decision to divide India and Pakistan is to accelerate the return of power to the Indians. Mountbatten is scheduled to leave India and return to Britain in early August.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 4th: Mountbatten assured the people of India today that Britain will not retain bases in India after India achieves independence under the British plan.</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] London, broadcast on the 4th: Mountbatten met with the Ministers of the Interim Cabinet of India today and declared afterwards: "To maintain peace during the transition period, the entire Indian armed forces will be used when necessary." Mountbatten said that this was a "secret" of the Indian Cabinet, but he also said that he was confident that the Indian problem could be resolved peacefully and there would be no bloodshed. 60,000 soldiers and police have been deployed to prevent conflicts between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 4th] Governor-General Mountbatten hosted hundreds of Indian and foreign reporters here today and stated that Britain would leave India when asked to withdraw from India. He said that the transfer of power in India, which was scheduled to be completed in June 1948, may be completed this year. Britain will leave India when asked to withdraw from India. We may have completely withdrawn from India by the end of this year, or a part of us may have to stay longer. The principle of the British in India is to be useful to India. If it is no longer useful and they are asked to withdraw, they should withdraw. I have tried my best to have the plan of the British Cabinet Mission accepted by the Indian leaders. This is a feasible plan, but it depends on mutual goodwill and cooperation to implement it. The plan accepted this time may not be the best solution, but in any case, the Indians should decide the future of their country themselves. I have worked closely with the Indian leaders at every stage of the development of this plan, so the Indian leaders were not surprised when this plan was put forward. We admit that this plan is not perfect. If there were a perfect solution, the Indian leaders would have been able to solve it themselves long ago. What I can do is to try my best to reconcile the opposing opinions of the two factions and make one party understand how to make its opinions meet the other party. The Governor-General continued, the Boundary Committee will include representatives of local ethnic groups, and no British official will force any party to accept its opinions, because this is the country of the Indians, and the Indians should decide everything themselves. We are deeply grateful for the firm expression of the responsible leaders in India that no matter what solution is finally adopted, it will be used in a peaceful and bloodless way. Every member of my cabinet has expressed the hope to use the military force in India to prevent bloodshed and violence. The Governor-General continued, setting up a solution for the status of autonomous territories. I have asked the Prime Minister to find a way to complete this legislation within two months, and he has indicated his consent. The Governor-General added that some people may think that Britain does not have the sincerity to withdraw from India, and only uses the status of autonomous territories as bait. It is important to know that if this plan is not a good solution, the Indian leaders would not have accepted it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] The two major Indian leaders, Nehru and Jinnah, broadcast to the Indian people tonight, announcing their acceptance of the British government's plan to transfer power to India, and called for peace and order. Nehru's broadcast stated that we should forget everything in the past. Although I accepted this plan with a not very pleasant mood, I feel that our decision this time is a correct decision. Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, continued to speak, emphasizing the importance of transferring power in a peaceful manner, and expressing the hope that India would maintain peace and harmony. Singh, the Minister of Defense of the Sikh Leader Provisional Government, spoke after Jinnah, saying that the British government's plan has opened up a new path beyond conflicting demands, and it is still a valuable plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 3rd] Muslim League leader Jinnah delivered a broadcast speech at a radio station here today, ordering Muslim League personnel in the Northwest Frontier Province to immediately stop the riots and stop the disobedience movement that has been resisting the government of the Northwest Frontier Province for the past three months.</p>
<h3>US Perceptions of the Indian Political Situation: Hoping to Maintain a State of Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] State Department officials did not express any other opinions on the British announcement of the plan to transfer power to India, except to express the hope that a state of peace could be maintained during the transition period. But they reiterated the opinions previously expressed by the State Department, stating the United States' friendship with India and the US government's interest in a satisfactory solution to the Indian political situation. Informally, there is a feeling of disappointment about the division of India, but they pointed out that the British plan does not exclude the possibility of reorganizing a unified Indian government in the future, so they hope that negotiations aimed at unification can still be held in the future. Congressman Saylor, the spokesperson for the American Indians, told our agency that from the economic geography and history of India, I do not believe that India, which is split into Pakistan and Hindustan, can develop smoothly. Moreover, Pakistan is separated from east and west, and Jinnah's request to set up a corridor between the east and west will make the situation even more chaotic. I also believe that when the Sikhs refuse to allow Muslims to touch Amritsar, the Sikh holy city in the province of Punjab, the Sikhs will also put forward the demand for Sikhistan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 4th] The new US Ambassador to India, Grande, left here by boat today to take up his post. Grande did not express his opinion on the British announced plan for Indian independence, only saying that Americans sympathize with the Indian problem and hope for an early solution.</p>
<h3>Truman Agrees to Convene: Western Hemisphere Defense Conference: Argentina Will Also Participate</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The White House recently announced that President Truman is now willing to renegotiate with other American countries on the Western Hemisphere Defense Conference. After returning to China to report on his duties, the Argentine Ambassador recently returned to his post here. He reviewed the measures taken by his government with Truman and Marshall, and explained that his country is still fulfilling the tasks of the Pan-American Conference on war and peace. The Argentine Ambassador continued to express that his government has no intention of obstructing negotiations and hopes to establish a mutual assistance agreement. Therefore, Truman also expressed his willingness to consult with various American countries to convene a Western Hemisphere Defense Conference, but he hoped that Argentina would be consistent in its words and deeds before the United States participates in the defense agreement.</p>
<h3>Argentina Clears: Nazi Forces Within Its Borders</h3>
<p>[United Press, Argentine Capital, 3rd] The Argentine Foreign Minister recently announced that the nationalization of Nazi property in Argentina has now entered the final stage. For example, the expulsion of Nazi elements is the main measure taken by Argentina to eliminate the Axis forces in order to join the Western Hemisphere Defense Group. It is heard that Vittorio, the son of Mussolini, may be deported.</p>
<h3>US Universal Military Training Issue: Congress to Begin Debate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] As the United States treads the path to becoming a strong nation through education, it now faces another historically significant choice: whether to adopt the universal military training program recommended by the Presidential Advisory Committee. For the US, this is an unprecedented step, completely different from tradition. As America cautiously moves towards leading the world and fulfilling its leadership responsibilities, this matter will spark another major debate in Congress and society. However, it will be a most difficult problem for Congress to decide. According to the consistent thinking of the American people, their military missions can be undertaken by a small number of professional army, navy, and air force personnel. Although the atomic bomb has greatly changed the general public's thinking about the future of US national defense, the majority of Congressmen still stubbornly hold to their old ideas, believing that supporting universal military training will give voters a bad impression politically, and they will lose votes in the next election. This is the biggest problem. According to several public opinion surveys, one of which indicated that 75% of people favored universal military training as necessary for national security, but the majority of Congressmen expressed disbelief. To date, some Congressmen believe that it is impossible to pass any similar military training bill in the current Congress (which will adjourn on July 30).</p>
<h3>US Senate to Vote Today: Approving Four-Nation Peace Treaty; Vandenberg Condemns Hungarian Communists</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The US Senate will vote tomorrow on the ratification of the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Congress yesterday in the Senate to take prompt action to ratify the four-nation peace treaties so that the work of European reconstruction could be rapidly launched.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated in an important speech in the Senate today that the Hungarian Communist Party's seizure of power has "provoked a further sense of outrage" and that the United States should ask UN agencies to investigate. Vandenberg also urged immediate ratification of the treaties with Italy and other countries, predicting that the Communist Party's "conspiracy to conquer" Hungary would be followed by "monopolized elections." He also hinted that the United States might take action without waiting long for Soviet cooperation, directly addressing the long-delayed issue of a comprehensive European peace treaty. His strong language reflected his policy alignment with the government towards the Soviet Union over the past few months. Regarding the Hungarian coup, Vandenberg's views also aligned with the State Department, which stated that the Communist Party's "expressed democratic ideals never had this level of ruthlessness." If all this is true, the United States may recognize its absolute duty to submit the entire matter to UN agencies. Hungary "has now become another Soviet satellite." Ratifying rather than rejecting the treaty with Hungary can preserve America's supreme interests. "If the treaty is not ratified, the Soviet Union will have no obstacles to continuing to control Hungary." This will make the country's democrats feel discouraged. Conversely, ratifying the treaty "will at least theoretically restore Hungary's status as a free nation. Then, any violations of that country can be handled by UN agencies."</p>
<h3>International Control of Atomic Issues: US and Soviet Views are Diametrically Opposed; Soviets Insist on Destroying Existing Atomic Bombs</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 3rd] Sources here recently stated that today's meeting of the UN Atomic Energy Commission was nothing less than a game of hide-and-seek between the US and the Soviet Union over the atomic bomb. Soviet representative Gromyko proposed an amendment to the report of the Atomic Energy Commission, stipulating that "international conventions prohibiting all countries from possessing and manufacturing atomic weapons should be completed by a convention establishing an international system for the control of atomic energy, in order to make them effective." This amendment effectively means that existing atomic weapons should be destroyed before the establishment of a control system. On the other hand, the US plan, which is included in the Atomic Energy Commission's report, advocates establishing a control system first, and then destroying existing atomic weapons, so that countries that are ahead in manufacturing atomic weapons are protected from being attacked by other countries during the gap between the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of a control system. The diametrically opposed views of the US and the Soviet Union were very evident at today's meeting. Representatives from Belgium and Australia expressed their willingness to support the US stance. Canadian representative McNaughton asked: What is the meaning of the word "supervision" in the international atomic energy control system? Gromyko immediately replied: The Soviet Union's acceptance of the atomic energy control system depends on the prior destruction of atomic weapons. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet view is definitely not acceptable to the United States.</p>
<h3>Australian Federal Government Passes New Five-Year Defense Plan; Undertakes Defense of British Empire in the Pacific</h3>
<p>[United Press, Canberra, 3rd] According to reliable sources, the Australian Cabinet has passed a five-year defense plan, including allocating funds for research into rockets and atomic energy, and has selected the Flinders Ranges as a location for testing rockets. Testing is expected to begin within a few months. According to United Press, Australia's post-war defense plan is roughly as follows: (1) establishing a strong chain of bases in the Pacific; (2) making Australia a defense base for all regions of the South Pacific, and establishing the most powerful naval base in the British defense plan in Sydney.</p>
<h3>US Congress Should Authorize the President to Send Military Missions Abroad; Secretary Marshall Urges Congress to Pass Bill</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Secretary of State Marshall asked Congress today to grant the President permanent authority to dispatch army and navy missions to foreign countries at their invitation, and said that granting the President this power does not violate the UN Charter. This move, in addition to contributing to the national interests of the United States, is also in line with the American tradition of assisting friendly nations to maintain their independence.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 3rd] Secretary of State Marshall told the House Military Affairs Committee today that if Congress immediately adopts legislation to extend the President's wartime powers, giving the President the authority to dispatch army and navy advisory missions to reside abroad, it would be of great benefit to the maintenance and advancement of US rights and interests. Marshall emphasized that such missions could only be dispatched at the request of foreign governments. Before dispatch, the President should carefully consider the matter, ensuring that the mission of the team is limited to an advisory nature. He also pointed out that the number of personnel in these missions should be small, mainly experts, and they should not engage in any intelligence work. According to Article 78 of the UN Charter, relations between member states should be "based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality." However, in a country where domestic order is chaotic and the crisis is deep, this goal seems difficult to achieve. Once a friendly government requests the dispatch of army and navy missions from this country, if the President does not have the authority to dispatch them, it only deprives the President of the ability to strategize. The US government has declared that it will implement its policy of maintaining peace throughout the world, and participate fully in world affairs with the qualifications of a world power. Marshall stated that if Congress does not pass this legislative bill, it will force the US missions currently stationed in Iran and China to withdraw. He expressed his disbelief, saying that "such actions will inevitably harm the interests of the United States." Marshall explained that the US advisory mission stationed in Nanjing was also dispatched under the President's wartime powers and "has absolutely no relationship to that country's internal conflicts. Our policy towards China has always been to assist that country in developing effective army and navy forces, with a limited number of personnel, so that China's financial institutions are not unduly burdened." This bill is exactly the same as the one submitted to the last Congress, and has been passed by the House and favorably reported to the Senate, but the Senate has not taken action before Congress adjourned.</p>
<h3>Greek Authorities Endorse US Troops Stationed in Greece</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] London, 4th Broadcast: Chairman of the Greek Cabinet's National Defense Committee, Nitzilos, stated that the strength of the Greek army needs to be doubled in order to cope with the overall situation. He expressed his agreement to the suggestion of stationing US troops in Greece to resist foreign aid to guerrillas. This suggestion was reportedly made privately by the government, due to rumors that Communist international brigades are preparing to enter Greece from Albania and Yugoslavia. However, it is generally believed that the United States will not take this step immediately.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 4th] Reports in the Greek press that an international military brigade is concentrated in Split, preparing to enter Greece, have recently been denied by responsible Yugoslav officials.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Smallholders' Party Implements Party Purge</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Budapest, 4th] The executive committee of the Hungarian Smallholders' Party (i.e., the Small Landholders' Party), the largest party in Hungary, recently resolved to conduct an investigation of all party members by a 158-member committee in order to eliminate factors that hinder the cooperation and progress of the coalition cabinet. Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, the leader of the Smallholders' Party, resigned last week after being accused by the Soviet Union of participating in a coup plot. The right-wing elements of the Smallholders' Party were accused of plotting a coup in February to restore former Regent Horthy, and many people were arrested and imprisoned.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Joint Commission Discusses Platform of Provisional Korean Government; Orders Subcommittee to Submit Reconciliation Plan by a Certain Date</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 4th] The US-Soviet Joint Commission recently issued its second joint communiqué, stating that the committee today discussed various documents, including directives and conditions for consulting with Korean political figures regarding the establishment of a provisional government in that country. It also ordered the subcommittee to submit a draft document reconciling the various principles before June 6. The committee also discussed two issues related to the platform of the provisional government that have not yet been fully agreed upon. US Chief Representative Brown did not follow the usual practice of receiving reporters after today's meeting to explain the contents of the communiqué.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 4th] US Lieutenant General Hodge sent a letter to Soviet General Korotkov, stating that if the Soviet occupation authorities allow US reporters to enter Pyongyang, the location of the Soviet military headquarters, then the US authorities will allow TASS reporters to go to Seoul. The letter was sent on June 3.</p>
<h3>Loutchy Orders South Korean Agencies to Use Provisional Government Name</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 4th] At a time when the US-Soviet Joint Commission talks are making some progress, South Korean military government officials suddenly revealed that General Loutchy and Civil Affairs Director Ahn Jae-hong issued Order No. 141 on May 17, stipulating that the South Korean Legislative Assembly and judicial organs should, from now on, be uniformly styled with the name of the South Korean Provisional Government. Prior to the US-Soviet talks, South Korean national leaders and civilian groups, especially Kim Yu and others from the former Korean Independence Government, intended to request the organization of a provisional government, but this was previously prohibited by the US military government.</p>
<h3>Emperor Hirohito Tours the Country, Claims to Fill His Stomach with Sweet Potatoes</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 4th] Emperor Hirohito left Tokyo this morning to tour the Osaka and Kobe areas for a period of twelve days. This is his first tour since the implementation of the new constitution. According to well-informed sources, MacArthur recently advised the Emperor during a meeting to tour various places again with the Empress. At the same time, Japanese newspapers published interviews with the Emperor and Empress. The Emperor claimed that sweet potatoes are his main food and that he enjoys writing poetry in his spare time. The silkworms raised by the Empress are expected to harvest about 160 kilograms of silk soon. The Empress said: "I have started learning English, but it is difficult. I am reading American fairy tales."</p>
<h3>Holy Land Investigative Group to Depart Next Wednesday</h3>
<p>Temporary Headquarters to be Established in Jerusalem</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, Lake Success, 3rd] Officials recently announced that the eleven-member UN Investigative Committee on Palestine will fly to Palestine on a special plane on the 11th of this month to conduct on-site investigations. It will establish its headquarters at the YMCA in Jerusalem and welcomes respected local figures to submit their opinions to the committee.</p>
<h3>Security Council Debates Issue of International Police Force</h3>
<p>Soviet Attitude Obstructive, Agreement Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] The UN Security Council is preparing to begin a general debate today on the organization of a world police force. Representatives of the various member states have formed a line against Soviet views. The US representative is scheduled to speak immediately after the meeting and will reportedly firmly support the basic report of the Military Staff Committee, which is drafting a plan for the organization of the world police force. The general opinions of the US, British, French, and Chinese members are consistent, but the Soviet member has expressed objections to more than one-third of the basic principles. According to a spokesperson for UN Deputy Representative Johnson, the international police force is the core of the entire UN security system, and the United States will urge the Security Council to publicly and thoroughly discuss this issue and establish an international army, navy, and air force as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Disarmament Issue Reaches Stalemate</p>
<p>Also, representatives of the five major powers held consultations yesterday to draft working procedures for the Disarmament Committee, but no agreement was reached. They have now virtually abandoned this attempt and notified the UN Secretariat to prepare a report for submission to the Disarmament Committee, explaining why the representatives of the five countries failed to draft these working procedures. The representatives of the five countries will hold a closed meeting on Friday to study this report and are expected to return the issue to the Disarmament Committee. It is reported that one of the major factors in the divergence of opinions among the representatives of the five countries is that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko sought to link the issue of atomic energy control to the tasks of the Disarmament Committee. But so far, the Disarmament Committee has only been ordered to draft recommendations for reducing armaments and military forces. The Soviet side has recently notified the relevant representatives of the UN Atomic Energy Control that they must decide sooner or later on the Soviet request that the Disarmament Committee prohibit atomic weapons.</p>

<h3>City Council Session Extended to Close Today; Rent Standard Proposal; Assembly Decides to Retain; Majority Believes It Should Not Be Set by City Council</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The City Council's three plenary sessions held its sixth meeting yesterday morning and its seventh meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss proposals. It was originally scheduled to close yesterday, but because there were so many proposals, yesterday's meeting, although it lasted until 8:40 PM, was still not completed. Therefore, it will continue the session for another day at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and then hold the closing ceremony.</p>
<p>During yesterday's general assembly, the discussion of the rent standard issue was the most heated. The council's Land Administration, Social Affairs Committee decided to retain it.</p>
<p>Councilor Zhu Wende believes that the city council has no power to change the rent standard. He also offered four points of advice to the city government: The previous standards of 180 times and 140 times should be revoked; please forward the housing leasing regulations to the Legislative Yuan for promulgation and implementation in this city; thoroughly investigate and crack down on illegal rents; and please expedite the completion of housing registration. Ma Junshuo believes that the current housing leasing situation is unreasonable and advocates that the housing leasing regulations should be implemented immediately. Establishing rent standards based on these regulations would be reasonable. Zhang Zhihan requested the assembly to decide on two points first: Does the assembly agree to amend the previously set 180 and 140 times standards by the city government? If agreed, will the upper limit be determined by the city council? After resolving these two questions, the rent management method can be discussed.</p>
<p>Should Be Drafted by the City Government</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua stated: The city government reviews and decides on grain prices, yarn prices, and commodity prices without submitting them to the city council. Similarly, the rent standard can also be drafted by the city government. He also expressed two opinions: The city government's previously set rent multipliers should be revoked immediately, and a rent review agency should be established within the city government to formulate provisional rent review regulations. The city government should encourage the construction of new houses and the repair of old houses in various ways. Zhang Nai-zuo said that since the previous standard set by the city government cannot be effectively implemented, the 1800 times proposed by the city government's suggestion and passed by the subcommittee would not be reasonable either. The city council has no power to decide on this case and advocates that it should not be discussed at all. Lu Shi-dao and Li Wenjie both supported Councilor Luo's opinion to retain this case and have the city government draft it with reference to the opinions. Some other councilors also expressed that it should be retained. However, there were also opponents who believed that the interests of the general public should be considered and a reasonable standard should be set.</p>
<p>Mayor Hopes for Support</p>
<p>Later, the Mayor explained that the city government did not intend to push this matter onto the city council. Because it was ordered by the Executive Yuan to consult public opinion on this standard, he requested the assembly to discuss it. But if a standard is not established, it will be impossible to review it. If this case is retained, the city government will not be able to set the standard. He hoped that the city council would support it.</p>
<p>Finally, it was put to a vote and "retention" was passed. The city government will handle the matter itself based on the Provisional City Council's resolution on rent management methods (i.e., regarding the revision of the method for calculating rent in this city, please consider both the income of the owners and the affordability of the citizens).</p>
<p>Regarding the case of "Reiterating the resolution of the first session and second general assembly of this council regarding the allocation of housing rental rights to households by the director in order to avoid causing disturbances," the councilors suggested establishing an enforcement agency. However, according to the mayor, this matter can only be addressed through personal connections, and if an agency is established, there will be no legal basis for enforcement. Therefore, the general assembly resolved: (1) Reiterate the resolution of the first session and second general assembly of this council regarding the director's allocation of housing rental rights to households.

<h3>Dentist Accused of Dealing in Gold and Banknotes; Local Procuratorate Summons for Investigation; Chen Zongliu Denies Responsibility</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Dentist Chen Zongliu was accused of dealing in black market US dollars and gold, disrupting the financial market. He was interrogated yesterday afternoon at the Local Procuratorate by Prosecutor Li Mingshan. He was ordered to be released on bail with a guarantee from a shareholder and a surety of 50 million yuan pending further investigation. It was reported by the police that the Xinyihe Money Exchange on the fourth floor of 225 Broadway was privately operating in black market US dollars and privately accepting remittances from overseas Chinese in Singapore to Fuzhou and other places, effectively acting as an underground bank. After investigation by the police, it was found that the Xinyihe Money Exchange was mistakenly referred to as Xinhe Shenzhuang. The Zhuang was managed by Yang Zhaoyan, who had left for Fujian the week before, and is now managed by Chen Zongliu. Chen is from Fujian, 42 years old. The business he operates is entrusted by the Yang Ren Yue Gold Shop in Singapore to handle joint remittances with various places in the country. The amount of remittances is very large, with remittance notices and applications for remittances to various places, and remittance telegrams, all complete. Regarding the private operation of black market US dollars, a book of records of black market US dollars, gold pounds, and gold bars was found on the fourth floor, with transaction dates mostly after the promulgation of the economic emergency measures in March of this year. Furthermore, a large number of gold bars, US dollars, British pounds, and other foreign currencies were found in a security box. The Zhuang's private operation of black market US dollars, gold, and other foreign exchange is highly suspected of violating the provisions of the economic emergency measures to crack down on gold speculation and prohibit the circulation of foreign currency.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the police sent the suspects Chen Zongliu, Zhao Zhenya, He Guiting, and the book of black market US dollars and gold bars to the Local Procuratorate. Prosecutor Li Mingshan immediately summoned Chen Jialiu for questioning. According to Chen's statement: Xinyihe Shenzhuang was opened by Yang Zhaoyan, the manager is Yang Renyue, and he is one of the shareholders and does not bear actual responsibility. His profession is a dentist, and his relationship with Yang is as a friend. When he was strictly questioned in court as to why his seal was affixed to every withdrawal, Chen stammered.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Shipyard Workers Strike Due to Index Dispute</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the publication of the May cost of living index, disputes over the employer's inability to bear the cost have continued. More than 4,000 workers at the Navy Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi went on strike because the shipyard refused to pay according to the index of 23,500 times, but instead calculated at 20,000 times discounted by 30%, and stated that if the workers were dissatisfied, they could leave. This led to a dispute. Two-thirds of the workers went on strike yesterday morning, and one-third were in a state of slow down. The workers also resolved three demands at a meeting at noon: (1) Pay according to 23,500 times. (2) Allow the full reinstatement of the more than 300 workers dismissed on June 1st. (3) No workers may be dismissed without reason in the future.</p>
<p>Cigarette Industry</p>
<p>Workers' wages are paid in two installments. The first half of May was temporarily paid according to the April index of 14,800 times, and the balance would be paid after the second half of the month's index was announced. Currently, the employers are unable to pay the remaining 23,500 times. The industry association sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to state the difficulties of each factory, stating that production of cigarettes is declining due to the upcoming rainy season and is no longer sustainable.</p>
<p>Machine Industry</p>
<p>Because employers cannot afford the index of 23,500 times, many have switched to paying at 14,000 times. Yesterday morning, machine workers in the Third District and Upper District sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to visit Labor Director Zhao Banfu. According to Zhao's extended statement: All issues caused by the index, as Director Wu said, can be resolved in a passive or active way to overcome difficulties together.</p>
<h3>Three Trade Associations Host Reporters to Appeal; Claiming to be Unable to Bear the Burden of the Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Machine Industry Association, the 12th District Metal Casting Industry Association, and the 3rd District Electrical Equipment Industry Association jointly hosted reporters at 3:00 PM yesterday. Yan Yaoqiu, Chairman of the Machine Industry Association, reported that the more than 1,000 member factories of the three associations are no longer able to bear the burden of the cost of living index of 23,500 times and will be unable to continue production. They requested the authorities to reduce workers' base wages and asked the Social Affairs Bureau to issue severance pay of three months to workers if the factory cannot be maintained and is closed. This is because the cost of living index has increased, and workers' base wages are unreasonable, so most member factories fear that they do not have enough to pay three months' severance pay to all workers. If base wages are not adjusted, the machinery industry in the city will inevitably collapse. If the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact, and workers will also lose their jobs. In order to maintain industry, increase production, and protect workers' jobs and livelihoods, it is appropriate to quickly find a good solution that takes into account both labor and management. Yesterday, Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau was visited. According to Director Wu's instructions, if necessary, a three-person committee can be formed by representatives from labor, management, and the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss solutions. However, Chairman Yan said that this is not a fundamental solution. Therefore, the directors and supervisors of the three associations decided to meet again at 3:00 PM on the 6th and visit Mayor Wu at 10:30 AM on the 7th to seek a reasonable solution.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Liu Yilong, the former director of the Hongkou District Office of the People's Shipping Industry Association's resident police, was transferred to the Local Procuratorate yesterday by the Water Police Sub-bureau for investigation on suspicion of "fraud."

<h3>Kalisheng Has Housing Dispute; Police Station Summons Yang Baochang</h3>

<h3>Residents of Xuhui District Petition; District Head Wronged; Falsely Accused of Accepting Bribes; Chen Xiaosong Guarantees Bao Dayong's Character</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] More than 300 representatives of residents, Baozhang representatives, Baoganshi representatives, merchants, and factory representatives of Xuhui District gathered to petition the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon because of the false accusation of District Head Bao Dayong accepting bribes, which aroused public indignation. According to the representatives, a lawless person named Zhou Yinchun used his evil influence to seize public land, mix up licenses, rebuild buildings, and endanger the safety of the neighborhood. The residents jointly reported this to various agencies and called for a halt. After the authorities sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and found it to be true, they ordered the demolition, recovered the land, and sent him to court for punishment. Unexpectedly, Zhou retaliated against District Head Bao and used Senator Xie Qingbai as a powerful background to trick Bao into eating, and then falsely accused Bao of accepting a bribe of 10 million yuan. Zhou's wife, Cheng Xiaobao, fabricated facts and filed a complaint with the Local Procuratorate. Therefore, they requested the transfer of a letter to the Local Court to expedite the investigation, reject the original lawsuit, severely punish Cheng Xiaobao for false accusation, and request the Municipal Government to strictly enforce the demolition of the buildings built by the Personnel Department, recover the occupied public land, and arrest and prosecute the fleeing Zhou Yinchun. Senators Fei Shuyin and Zhou Chengxiang received the representatives and reported to the conference. Later, Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Civil Affairs Department said: (1) This case is currently being investigated by the court, and the Municipal Government should not interfere. (2) But I guarantee with my personal character that District Head Bao will never be corrupt. He himself has five or six shops and is usually very honest. This District Head is not my private person, but I also support him. In addition, Senator Zhou Xiangcheng also visited the house built by Zhou Yinchun last time and confirmed that there were violations of regulations. Finally, the conference decided: (3) The council will send a letter to the Municipal Government and the court to investigate and handle the case impartially. In addition, the three committees of Public Works, Autonomy, and Land Administration will jointly investigate the case. Huang Zhensheng especially requested the conference and the Municipal Government to pay attention to this kind of situation, which is very common in society. After Zhou Chengxiang reported the conference's decision to the representatives, the representatives left.</p>
<h3>Accurate Calculation of Inheritance Tax is Especially Difficult; Account Auditing for Profit Tax Avoids Harassment; Director of the Direct Taxation Bureau Answers Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Lou Guowei, Director of the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was invited by the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon, and various senators raised inquiries. Director Lou answered them one by one: (1) The best officials of the Finance Department have ordered the handling of profit tax audits in accordance with laws and regulations. This system is the most reasonable, fair, and good system. After the implementation, we will try our best to study how to avoid harassment and prevent fraud. Therefore, before the auditors carry out the audit, they will adopt a lottery method to ensure that they do not contact a certain shop or factory that they have audited in the past, and the audit date should not exceed two days to avoid collusion. If it exceeds the time limit, others will be sent to audit. At the same time, representatives from the industry association and the chamber of commerce are welcome to supervise. If there is any fraud, it will be dealt with according to law. (2) Regarding the return of account books, the Direct Taxation Bureau has no right to do so, but I (that is, last night) will send an urgent telegram to the authorities for instructions and will reply tomorrow (that is, today). (3) The current maximum denomination of stamp tax is 3,000 yuan, and those of 10,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan will be issued soon. (4) The inheritance tax is very difficult to implement thoroughly because the notification of declaration is inaccurate, so the investigation is very difficult, especially for movable property, which is more difficult to calculate. Lou's reply stopped here, because there was not enough time, it was resolved that Director Lou would attend again today to answer.</p>
<h3>Dr. Conway Publishes Plan to Improve Shanghai Traffic in the United States</h3>

<h3>Students Arrested for Minor Offenses to be Released at End of Semester</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhu Jingnong and other school officials of the arrested students in the city visited Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM yesterday. The mayor answered the questions raised by the Fudan professor, stating that students arrested for minor offenses should be released during the final exam period of this semester, and the school can allow them to take make-up exams. Those with more serious offenses will be released after being guided through education. Mayor Wu believes that if the schools insist on handing them over to the court for trial, it is also permissible. However, during the period of education, it is not intended to apply legal provisions. As for the students who should be arrested but have not yet been arrested, it is hoped that they can surrender themselves. As for other students who are not listed for arrest, if they continue to disrupt the school and society in an orderly manner, they will still be arrested. Finally, Mayor Wu replied to the representatives that the reason why students with minor offenses cannot be released immediately is for fear that they will be emotional after returning to school and "make waves" again.</p>

<p>上法學生屈元　已死說絕對不確</p>
<p>The claim that Qu Yuan, a student of Shanghai Law School, is dead is absolutely false.</p>
<p>〔中央社訊〕昨日本市時代日報載稱：新押於地院看守所之法學院女生屈元，因受傷過重慘死獄中云云。記者昨特走訪地院看守所負責人，探其確息，據告：屈元前確有病，經所方延醫診治，現已痊愈，其精神亦因病數隊好而漸佳。前日渠之家屬，曾往探視，並送食物。該報所載已死之說，絕對不確。</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] Yesterday, the Shanghai Times reported that Qu Yuan, a female student of the Law School recently detained in the District Court Detention Center, died tragically in prison due to excessive injuries. Yesterday, this reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of the District Court Detention Center to investigate the facts.

<p>廣州學生工人又方俱願調解　學生被擊斃說不確</p>
<p>Both students and workers in Guangzhou are willing to mediate; the claim that students were shot dead is false.</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州三日電〕昨日港報載，美聯社廣州一日電調：「由於廣州中山大學二千名學生昨日舉行，反內戰大遊行之結果，五名學生被聲斃，此外尙有頗多學生受傷及失蹤」云，據當日自始至終，隨同學生巡行之中央社記者之目擊，及事後之調查，學生絕無一人喪命，亦無失蹤者。美聯社此一報導，對當時情形缺乏具體之確實材料。據記者所知，學生方面，傷勢最重者為文學院外文系二年級生柏健欣，現留醫中大聯院，有生命危險。工人方面，傷勢最重者四人，一名梁少波者最重，有性命危險。</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] Yesterday, Hong Kong newspapers reported that the Associated Press in Guangzhou reported on the 1st: "As a result of the anti-civil war parade held by 2,000 students of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou yesterday, five students were shot dead. In addition, many students were injured and missing." According to the Central News Agency reporter who accompanied the students throughout the parade that day, and the subsequent investigation, not a single student died, nor were any missing. This Associated Press report lacks concrete and accurate materials on the situation at the time. According to what this reporter knows, the most seriously injured student is Bai Jianxin, a second-year student of the Department of Foreign Languages ​​in the College of Arts, who is currently hospitalized in the United Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and is in critical condition. On the workers' side, four people were most seriously injured, one of whom, Liang Shaobo, is the most severely injured and in critical condition.</p>

It concluded on the evening of the 3rd, and both parties are willing to restrain themselves and prevent similar incidents from happening again.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] The Wuhan University incident has entered the stage of complete resolution. This morning, Cheng Qian, Director of the Executive Yuan, handed a handwritten letter to Deputy Director Sun Weiruyi to take to Wuhan University to express condolences to the faculty and students of the school. The wording was extremely sincere, and the following measures were decided for the handling of the aftermath in response to the four requests made by the faculty association: (1) Punishment of the perpetrators: Investigate and identify the commanding officers whose deployment was inadequate and handled improperly, as well as the four people who fired the first shot, and order the Garrison Command to escort them to the Military Law Office of the Executive Yuan to investigate their responsibilities and severely punish them according to the law. (2) Compensation measures: Each of the three deceased students will be given a compensation fee of 40 million yuan and a burial fee of 10 million yuan to their families. Each seriously injured student will be given medical expenses of 10 million yuan, and another 20 million yuan will be distributed to lightly injured students (total medical and compensation expenses are 200 million yuan). (3) Security issues: In the future, the school authorities will be responsible for all student activities on campus, and no military or police will be sent to take action. However, if students engage in excessive actions outside the school that affect social security, the security agencies may still take appropriate preventive measures. (4) Release of arrested faculty and students: This has been fully implemented and does not need to be discussed further. In addition, the fact that a certain military police company commander on that day was able to comply with the code of conduct and never counterattack will be submitted for commendation in order to clarify right and wrong. According to reports, after this decision was announced, the grief of the faculty and students of the school was greatly comforted. People from all walks of life also deeply admire the government's sincerity in caring for young people and handling matters impartially. It is generally believed that this unfortunate incident will be completely resolved from now on.</p>

<p>征輪臨去秋波　昨大勝聖保羅　六五比四九分</p>
<p>Zhenglun shows final charm before departure; decisively defeats St. Paul yesterday; 65 to 49</p>
<p>〔本職訊〕美海軍聖保羅艦籃球隊昨晚七時約戰征輪於市體育館，球迷作壁上觀者千餘人，結果征輪以六十五比四十九大勝，上半時卅八比十九，下半時因征輪調動數人，使各隊員均獲活動機會，一顯身手，故下半時聖保羅反多得三分，征輪廿七，美軍三十分。</p>
<p>[Our post] The US Navy St. Paul warship basketball team played against Zhenglun at the City Gymnasium at 7 PM last night. Thousands of fans watched from the sidelines. As a result, Zhenglun won a decisive victory with a score of 65 to 49. The first half was 38 to 19. In the second half, because Zhenglun mobilized several players, all team members had the opportunity to move around and show their skills. Therefore, in the second half, St. Paul scored three more points, Zhenglun scored 27, and the US military scored 30.</p>
<p>聖保羅之球　，事前大義猜測，以致票價亦頗感難定，觀上半時之局勢，觀衆雖笑口皆開，但在演出方面似呈失望，安知下半時之愈戰愈勇，其作風與哥倫布相同，內以栢佛脫約瑟腦威門三人蛟佳，征輪昨晚得分特多，上半時更暢所欲為。材濟濟，几十二人之多，內有黑人名湯姆生，白背心襯上紅花白底洋布袴，怡然自得。</p>
<p>Before the St. Paul game, there was much speculation, so the ticket price was difficult to determine. Looking at the situation in the first half, the audience laughed, but seemed disappointed with the performance. Who knew that they would become more courageous in the second half? Their style was the same as Columbus. Among them, Butler, Joseph, and Nuoweimen were excellent. Zhenglun scored a lot of points last night and did whatever they wanted in the first half. There were many talented people, as many as twelve, including a black man named Tomson, who wore a white vest with a red flower and white background Western-style pants, and was very comfortable.</p>
<p>比賽七時發動，先舉行贈旗禮，美海軍聖保羅隊長拿馬爾於三十秒鐘內獨臂托入一球，使征輪變色。于瑞章藥忠强罰獨獲三分，海軍即暫停，屠得手，約瑟海爾均未罰中，後柏佛脫約瑟各有所得，奈我輜汽軍三劍客于蔡屠之不絕探籃，分數猛晋，十七比十時，聖保羅裴克易出拿馬爾，廿一比十奎爾司又易海耳。社腦溫與屠文龍均屬好手，雙方得分容易，行動均快速，方于瑞章擲球時，球已將近籃圈，被海爾拍出，足見脚下彈力甚强。二十分鐘過去，上半時相去剛一半，為卅八與十九之比，聖保羅落後一半。</p>
<p>The game started at 7 o'clock. First, a flag presentation ceremony was held. Lamar, the captain of the US Navy St. Paul team, shot a goal with one arm in 30 seconds, which made Zhenglun change color. Yu Ruizhang and Yao Zhongqiang uniquely earned three points by penalty. The Navy immediately suspended. Tu got the ball, but Joseph and Hale failed to score the penalty. Later, Butler and Joseph each gained something. However, the three musketeers of our transport army, Yu, Cai, and Tu, constantly explored the basket, and the score soared. At 17 to 10, St. Paul's Pek replaced Lamar, and at 21 to 10, Quiles replaced Hale again. She Nuowen and Tu Wenlong were both good players. Both sides scored easily and moved quickly. When Fang Yu Ruizhang threw the ball, the ball was close to the basket and was shot out by Hale, which showed that his leg elasticity was very strong. Twenty minutes passed, and the first half was just halfway through, with a ratio of 38 to 19. St. Paul was half behind.</p>
<p>競爭白熱　　下半時征輸因佔極地優勢，乃以新人參戰，于蔡屠外，爲：程飛·稽德臧·栢佛脫·約瑟罰進三分，屠罰中，約瑟又在藍下奪中一球，四十四比一十四，劉政軍調程飛聖保羅此間亦大事更動，川流不息，但善投籃者不多，僅仰賴約瑟栢佛脫拿馬爾撑市面而已。雙方競爭劇烈，一度曾見白熱化，各顯穿楊之技。長後十分鐘內形勢更緊，聖保羅大見起色，傳球較征輸說利，結果因上半時征輪之「過剩」，遠征軍仍得以六十五比四十九勝利。</p>
<p>The competition was fierce. In the second half, because Zhenglun occupied an extremely advantageous position, they used new players to participate in the war. In addition to Yu, Cai, and Tu, there were: Cheng Fei, Qi Dezang, Butler, and Joseph who scored three points on penalty. Tu scored the penalty, and Joseph scored another goal under the basket, 44 to 14. Liu Zhengjun adjusted Cheng Fei. St. Paul also made major changes during this period, with an endless stream of people, but there were not many who were good at shooting baskets, and they only relied on Joseph, Butler, and Lamar to support the market. The competition between the two sides was fierce, and at one point it became white-hot, with each showing their skills. The situation became tighter in the last ten minutes, and St. Paul greatly improved. Passing the ball was more advantageous than Zhenglun. As a result, due to Zhenglun's "excess" in the first half, the expeditionary force was still able to win with a score of 65 to 49.</p>

<p>Literary Psychology in the Publishing World</p>
<p>By Dan Meng, written by Zhu Guangqian, published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>Within the broad group of artistic youth, there is a widespread desire for several theoretical books that can help them break into the literary field, serving as stepping stones or guides. However, there is still a lack of a more effective handbook. Currently, there are many publications guiding young people in the initial stages of literary study, but they are usually either too superficial or overly specialized. The former leaves the reader with just a taste, unable to grasp the scenery of the entire literary world and understand the effort required to live in a literary atmosphere. The latter makes beginners shrink back or even cultivate rigid, scholastic ideas, confining themselves to libraries. In order to find a reading material that can bridge the gap between the above two levels, this book will be very suitable to fill this void.</p>
<p>The so-called "Literary Psychology" is just a type of "aesthetics." However, it differs from other aesthetics because this book has its unique direction. According to the author himself, this is a book that "studies aesthetics from a psychological perspective," a book that studies literary creation and appreciation, and even literary criticism. It not only covers abstract aesthetic principles but also empirically investigates the context of literary forms and content, thereby summarizing an overview of literature. The author's original intention was to write for young people who aspire to deeply love literature, so it is not superficial, preventing readers from being like a sailor talking about astronomy or a nurse talking about medical instruments, relying entirely on crude experience. Instead, it is based on an objective, systematic, and rigorous scientific understanding. It is also not too profound, preventing those who only have an interest in appreciating literature from refusing to accept it.</p>
<p>The main structure of this book is divided into two parts: literary creation and literary appreciation. Whether it is creation or appreciation, whether standing aside as an observer or expressing oneself within the situation, the first step is to refine some traditional views. It is not enough to rely solely on one's own miscellaneous experiences to be considered complete. The author pays attention to this point in every small section, so it has the advantages of a theoretical book without its flaws, grasping the effectiveness of a theoretical book without being detached from reality.</p>
<p>The author not only introduces some achievements of modern Western aesthetics but also adds his own insightful views, which surpasses all the common materials available. Although the author narrates from an objective standpoint, he also expresses his judgments and comments. He compares, compromises, and extends, carefully writing down his own views on the various schools of aesthetic thought that have been hotly discussed and debated in recent times. He may not have intended to create his own system, but his unique insights are indeed commendable. He seems to adopt the formalist aesthetics passed down from Kant to Croce as his belief, considering aesthetic experience to be purely an intuition of form. However, he can also break away from the theoretical constraints of Kant and Croce, recognizing that life is an organism, and thus opposing the mechanical view and abstract analysis of the Croce school.</p>
<p>Chapters one to four are preliminary analyses of the most fundamental question: "What is aesthetic experience?" "What are our psychological activities in aesthetic experience?" and "What kind of things can be considered beautiful?" The author presents them in a very engaging way, gradually explaining the four elements of aesthetic experience: "intuition of form," "psychological distance," "empathy," and "inner imitation." Each unit is analyzed and extended so thoroughly, with examples, metaphors, selections from famous Western philosophers, and the addition of some opinions from ancient Chinese sages, so that any reader not only understands the author's views but can also believe in them and apply them. The author moves from psychology to aesthetics with such proficiency, smoothness, and seamlessness!</p>
<p>Following chapter five is "Several Misunderstandings about Aesthetic Experience"; chapter six is "Aesthetics and Association." The former chapter is a supplement to the previous four chapters, pointing out three common misunderstandings and their explanations: (1) the confusion between aesthetic feeling and pleasure; (2) the confusion between aesthetic attitude and critical attitude; and (3) the confusion between simple sensory perception and rational thinking. The latter chapter connects the following chapters with the previous chapters and is an independent case.</p>
<p>Chapters seven and eight, "Literature and Morality," discuss the value issue of literary good and evil. Starting from chapter nine below, the core of aesthetics begins to be explored. Chapter nine, "Natural Beauty and Natural Ugliness - The Compromise between Naturalism and Idealism," resolves the long-standing conflicting views in literature; and further defines "beauty" and "ugliness," distinguishing the mystical interpretations of aesthetic standards. Chapter ten continues the conclusion of the previous chapter, "The beauty of art is not natural," and establishes a new standard of aesthetic theory, clarifying the fields of beauty, goodness, and truth. Here, the basic knowledge of aesthetics has been completely explained. Chapter eleven is a criticism of Croce's aesthetics, a very clever introduction and establishment, overflowing with the essence of communication.</p>
<p>Chapter twelve onwards marks the beginning of another major part. From "The Origin of Art and Games" to "The Creation of Art." Chapter thirteen talks about the basic conditions of "creation": imagination and inspiration; chapter fourteen talks about the complete conditions of "creation": talent and human effort. The content of these two chapters is the most complex and rich, comprehensively analyzing the difficult situation faced when an artwork is made, and finally saying that the creation of an artwork is quite arduous. Chapters fifteen onwards discuss specific issues in art: "Feminine Beauty and Masculine Beauty," "The Joy of Tragedy," and "Laughter and Comedy," which are the most relaxed and interesting three chapters in the book. Readers see thought-provoking revolutions in every light-hearted journey. The last three chapters are appendices, which respectively discuss the beauty of color, the beauty of form, and the beauty of sound, which are about painting, plastic arts, and music, all adopting the latest modern theories.</p>
<p>The middle part of this book roughly belongs to the study of literary creation, while the preceding and following paragraphs tend to focus on appreciation. However, it is never split too mechanically, because appreciation is also a reflection of creation, so the author explains them individually and comprehensively. At the same time, although this book is "psychological," it also explores the truth of literary touches physiologically, socially, and philosophically. Its strengths will include the following three points: (1) Practical: Each chapter and each section never engages in empty talk but reasons from a practical process; (2) Scientific: The author never is idealistic nor mechanically unfolds his own thoughts; (3) Critical: It is not just a textbook or a similar product. Everywhere, one can see the author's choice and measurement of traditional truths, but it is also not narrow-minded. In addition, what is even more commendable is the author's writing style, which is so fluent and interesting, unlike the dryness of general theoretical books. Because of these points and the urgent need to introduce it to others, although this book is now reprinted, because the first edition has not been sold widely, it is still so new that everyone who has not read it is eager to read it as soon as possible. It is an interesting book.</p>
<h3>Biography of Romain Rolland</h3>
<p>By Yang Tongfang, Translated by Ronald A. Wilson, Translated by Shen Lianzhi</p>
<p>Published by: Cultural Life Publishing House</p>
<p>Publication Date: First edition, January of the 36th year [of the Republic]</p>
<p>Romain Rolland is a pioneer in the modern ideological world, and the brilliance of his thoughts shines in every corner of the world. Our need to understand Romain Rolland can be said to be multifaceted, because he is not only a great historian, biographer, and playwright, but also an unparalleled poet and prophet in France, and even more so a transcendent thinker and a courageous pacifist.</p>
<p>To understand this outstanding figure of the era from these aspects, the recently published "Biography of Romain Rolland" should be worth reading. The original author, the American Ronald A. Wilson, has an excellent understanding of Rolland's thoughts. He has compiled a collection of his usual thematic studies on this great thinker. Although they are several articles that can stand alone, they have a consistent thought. From here, we can easily get a glimpse of the lifelong struggle of a groundbreaking thinker.</p>
<p>The full sound is divided into nine chapters: Chapter One "Early Life", Chapter Two "Early Plays", Chapter Three "Beethoven Biography", Chapter Four "Michelangelo Biography", Chapter Five "Tolstoy Biography", Chapter Six "Romain Rolland: Scholar and Poet", Chapter Seven "Romain Rolland's Hero", Chapter Eight "English Biography and John, Christopher", Chapter Nine "Romain Rolland and New Idealism." An appendix includes "Two Letters from Romain Rolland to American Friends". Each narrative is very clear and lively, able to grasp the essence of Rolland's thought. It can be regarded as a history of Rolland's life or as a history of Rolland's creation. Ordinary people only superficially regard Rolland as an ordinary writer, but in fact, Rolland's works are a reflection of his ideological and life struggles. From his ordinary life to his later years, he always pursued a lofty ideal in life. As A. Seche said, his life is permeated with the power of conscience and morality, and he tirelessly strives to realize his beliefs - beauty, love, and love of life. Yes, Rolland's prestige is great enough, and each of his works is full of the vitality of life.</p>
<p>Rolland is the greatest biographer in modern French literary circles. Although he has also written many plays, essays, and poems, his thoughts can be represented by several world-renowned biographies. Rolland wrote biographies not only to conduct historical research but to display the great personality and sentiments of a biographical figure. He writes about the many forms of life of biographical figures through extremely precise observations. He creates based on a firm belief and love for life and thought, so his works can deeply grasp people's hearts, vivid and powerful, bright and sincere, which greatly moves the reader.</p>
<p>I feel that Rolland's life includes a process of struggling with thought and life. His works are full of love for humanity. He sings praises of human spiritual beauty and intellectual beauty. All evils in society must be remedied by spiritual beauty and intellectual beauty. Only freedom and democracy can create human harmony and social progress. The artistic value of Rolland's biographical works is especially expressed in the fine details of the characters' lives, often avoiding those prominent actions written by general historians. From trivial daily life, even a single word or sentence, can arouse inner excitement.</p>
<p>Romain Rolland's early life already nurtured the seeds of his later great thoughts. A tranquil and beautiful living environment gave him the opportunity to contemplate silently. The musical education of his childhood nourished his lonely mood, using music, the most beautiful language, to purify his thoughts and inspire his aspirations. Music gave him a great life force, which later influenced him in his creative work, whether it was biography or drama. Everyone knows that Rolland has unparalleled love for mankind. He curses social evils and calls for human cooperation. This great enlightenment, according to himself, is indeed due to the cultivation of music. Music can reveal the truth, express the common demands of mankind, and emotionally enable people to achieve deep sympathy and understanding between each other.</p>
<p>After I completed Wilson's "Biography of Romain Rolland," my narrow thoughts and feelings were sublimated into a kind of aspiration and expectation for mankind. Romain Rolland's thoughts belong to the people, to all mankind. His new idealism destroys all the meanness and selfishness, corruption and malice in the world. He leads mankind to a new stage in history, establishing universal human love with the creative touch of a poet. How lofty is his ideal in life, how great is his creative purpose!</p>
<p>Romain Rolland's name, some say, is a symbol of free thought. His life is one of fighting, of courage, never bowing to fate, only knowing how to constantly challenge the darkness of life. He believes that people can only find the fountain of life by living in suffering. From his letters to his American friends, one can see what a historian, thinker, and poet he is, who is loyal to life and loyal to creation, leading mankind towards a new century.</p>
<p>In the current stage of worldwide chaos, human suspicion and hatred have not been eradicated with the Second World War. We deeply regret the death of this pioneering thinker. His homeland has finally struggled out of Nazi enslavement, but he quietly left the world, which is really heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Therefore, I recommend this "Biography of Romain Rolland" to people who love justice and peace. Although it is not a monumental masterpiece, Wilson's writing is full of beautiful literary interest, and it does not make people feel boring. Shen Lianzhi's translation can also achieve fluency and elegance, with a trace of poetic atmosphere seeping out from between the lines, which is very worthwhile to let people understand.</p>
<h3>Review of "Social Monthly"</h3>
<p>By Jin Wen</p>
<p>Publisher: Social Monthly Society (Inside the Shanghai Linsen Road Social Bureau)</p>
<p>Editor: Yuan Wenzhang</p>
<p>Price: 2,000 yuan per issue</p>
<p>This is a periodical published by various competent departments of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, publishing business reports, publishing social laws and regulations, discussing social issues, and analyzing social phenomena. From its founding on July 5th of the 35th year [of the Republic], it has now reached the third issue of the second volume. Looking at the contents of each issue, I deeply feel that this "Social Monthly" is worth reviewing.</p>
<p>Social administration is a new administration in our country; social undertakings are a kind of modern undertaking; and social problems are varied and complex, and are also the most important problems that cause cutting pain to everyone today. However, publications that review social administration, social undertakings, and study social problems are uniquely lacking today. In the past, there were research magazines on sociology, but they had too much of an academic flavor and rarely discussed practical issues. And the "Social Monthly" is indeed the only publication today that studies social administration, social undertakings, and social problems. Although this monthly is run by the government, it has no official bulletin flavor at all, which is valuable. Therefore, it can always maintain a lively style and a pragmatic attitude.</p>
<p>As for the content, based on the nine issues that I have read, the advantages and disadvantages are equally visible, which are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the advantages of the content of the "Social Monthly": 1. The data value is relatively high. Each issue of the journal has data-based papers, and the materials strive for credibility, and the descriptions are concise and essential. The data value is indeed not bad. For example, the articles "Shanghai Labor Dispute Statistics" each month, "The Trend of the Publishing Industry in Shanghai," "The Past and Present of the Shanghai Manual Labor Mutual Aid Society," and "The Evolution of the Shanghai Social Bureau" are mostly available for sociological researchers to refer to. 2. Business reports and policy guidelines are fully revealed in the journal, which can enable readers to understand the social administration and social undertakings of Shanghai. 3. Laws and regulations and appendices all publish important laws and regulations, with conspicuous compilation and convenient review, without the cumbersome nature of general government gazettes. It is convenient for readers to refer to.</p>
<p>Regarding the disadvantages of the "Social Monthly": 1. Research reports on social surveys in Shanghai are lacking; 2. There is a lack of papers that interpret social administrative laws and regulations. Past social laws, such as the "Social Relief Law," the "National Compulsory Labor Law," and the "Trade Union Law" currently under review, are all worth interpreting, which is very helpful for readers and social administrative personnel to refer to. The lack of these in the journal is indeed regrettable; 3. There is a slight lack of papers on sociological theories and social policies. I believe... a publication with a very high standard that pays attention to the practical effectiveness of social administration should not have this shortcoming.</p>
<p>Based on a review of the overall content, the "Social Monthly" is indeed a valuable publication. Its important features are its rigorous compilation, pragmatic content, and credible data. I would like to recommend it to readers. As for the shortcomings I mentioned, they are just personal opinions. If necessary, I hope the editors will further enrich the content.</p>
<h3>"The Idiot"</h3>
<p>By Shi Pei, written by Fyodor Dostoevsky, translated by Geng Jizhi, published by Kaiming Publishing House</p>
<p>In 1867, Dostoevsky, in order to escape the pursuit of greedy creditors, took his newly married wife on a trip abroad. During the four years of travel, he completed two immortal novels, "The Idiot" and "Demons".</p>
<p>"The Idiot" tells the story of a young Duke Myshkin, who is in love with two young girls. Nastasya, an orphaned daughter of a small landowner, became a pitiful, self-abandoning woman because she lost herself to Rogozhin. This made the Duke develop an almost fateful pity and love for her. At the same time, when the Duke went to General Yepanchin's house, he was also attracted by the charming love of the General's daughter, Aglaya. She was a proud and pure virgin, and they fell in love passionately shortly after meeting. Therefore, Duke Myshkin was caught in the middle of these two women, and he did not know what to do. One was an almost fanatical love, and the other was a warm and considerate love. The twists and turns evolved to the end. Just when the Duke decided to hold a wedding ceremony with Nastasya, the unfortunate Nastasya was kidnapped and murdered by Rogozhin. Before this happened, General's daughter Aglaya had become a madman, and as a result, the Duke completely fell into mental confusion. This tragic ending concludes this story of love and entanglement between hearts.</p>
<p>Although "The Idiot" is a love novel, Dostoevsky does not start from the needs of human carnal love, but extracts the issues of the mutual relationship between people in the world, the pain of life, and the issues of conscience, good and evil as viewpoints, and uses these clues to form another side of real life, deeply and clearly touching on the essence of life. After reading it, we unconsciously develop a deep sympathy for the characters in the book. Therefore, the structure of "The Idiot" can give us a special and high degree of inspiration, which is very different from other ordinary love novels.</p>
<p>In this book, Dostoevsky wrote with brilliant and sharp writing, and there are many scenes that moved me. Among them, the real feeling of facing death on the execution ground, and the inner experience of being attacked by epilepsy, are described in great detail. This is a rare and valuable realistic writing.</p>
<p>Because during 1849, Dostoevsky was arrested for participating in the Petrashevsky Circle with the crime of "ideological conspiracy." In fact, this group did not have any active plans, but was only a combination of some young people for the purpose of studying and discussing general social thoughts. However, the autocratic and tyrannical Nicholas I did not let go of these "free thinkers." At the end of that year, Dostoevsky and his friends who were arrested together were sentenced to death. They had all made a sad decision, thinking that they would die in a few minutes. Just when they were hesitating between life and death, the Emperor's order suddenly changed, and the death sentence was reduced to exile. Dostoevsky personally received this terrible stimulus, and his heart was forever buried with this engraved memory. Moreover, Dostoevsky himself suffered from epilepsy, which was the greatest misfortune that accompanied him throughout his life. "The Idiot" is his way of expressing the above two kinds of unfortunate emotions and feelings by describing the life of the protagonist Duke Myshkin, which is vividly displayed and deeply touches the hearts of readers.</p>
<p>In "The Idiot", Dostoevsky wanted to create Duke Myshkin as a gentle and humble, truly perfect person. He has such a pure soul and such a simple and purified personality, but he is regarded as an idiot by others; even so, his simple, child-like wisdom comforts all those who come into contact with him with a spirit of light and friendship. The author's use of this descriptive technique is very complete and successful.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I have silently been thinking, we live in today's society where deception is trending against the tide. I wonder how many truly kind people are regarded as "idiots" by others; conversely, I wonder how many evil people are worshipped as "saints"? Readers of this immortal masterpiece may always have infinite feelings.</p>
<h3>Free Talk on Dance Ban and Great Prevention</h3>
<p>By Luo Bi</p>
<p>From the opening to the closing of the Political Participation Council, everything is important, but between the tension and solemnity, we once heard a relaxed laugh and saw an interesting scene, that is, the proposal to ban dancing by Senator Zhang Zhijiang.</p>
<p>The discussion of banning dancing and dancing has seemed to last a long time in our country. However, before, some people advocated banning dancing because of frugality and morality. This time, Zhang's advocacy for banning dancing is more serious. It is called: Great Prevention.</p>
<p>The theory of the great prevention between men and women seems to have been a thing of the past for a long time, but those who are as determined as Zhang see that "social dances between men and women are taught and received intimately, and men and women hug and entwine closely when dancing. This not only removes the gradual prevention of society but also opens the door to convenience," which is ultimately difficult to tolerate and unwilling to remain silent.</p>
<p>Dancing in our country flows to the entertainment of sensuality and pleasure, which is a fact. "I don't know how many people are tempted to be fascinated and unable to extricate themselves" is also a true experience. Today, it is a very common phenomenon for underage students to carry their schoolbags to the dance floor. However, "to protect the dignity of the Republic of China, it should be strictly prohibited" is a bit of an exaggeration. This is not only because dancing has nothing to do with the issue of face, but also because social dance between men and women is not a domestic product but one of the European styles that has gradually spread eastward. In jazz music, foreigners are probably more accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Dancing itself is not a sin, so it is okay to correct the bad phenomenon of today's dance style, but it is a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater to block normal social interaction between men and women because of it. Speaking of great prevention, it can be said to have been flourishing a hundred years ago, but how many stories like backyard gardens have been left to us? This is why the theory of separate schools for men and women has also been criticized by experts today.</p>
<p>It is only when there is no prevention between men and women that there can be great prevention. This is a principle that is opposite but complementary. It is also unreasonable to measure today with the moral standards of a hundred years ago. As for criticizing dancing for leading to love, is it still an era when marriage should be based on matchmakers today?</p>
<p>Although it is said that today's dancing and the "dancing with sword" of the past are very different, in terms of dancing itself, it is only a legitimate social interaction, and it does not expect it to be a training of skills. Before the social relationship between our men and women is fully reasonable today, dancing as a legitimate social interaction is still worth maintaining, I think.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Twins</h3>
<p>Translated by Xin Zi</p>
<p>Experts who study twins say that twins are not only similar in body and appearance, but also in the path of life that each of them takes. Although it is very different due to the environment, the reaction to encounters often has amazing and incredible similarities.</p>
<p>We know that the lifespan of each person's organs is already destined in the womb. Some experts have obtained an interesting fact from a group of twins aged from fifty to eighty, that is, the physical changes of each twin are obviously very similar. Even the first gray hair on their heads will be born at the same time and in the same place. As for the shape of baldness, it will also be consistent.</p>
<p>Professor Furt carefully observed the growth of nineteen pairs of twins. He found that the wrinkles on the forehead, cheeks, mouth, and eyes of each pair of twins were the same. Their teeth would deteriorate at the same time. No matter how far apart they lived, if one of them suffered pain or encountered unfortunate things, the other would also be affected at the same time. This often discovered fact has become the most mysterious phenomenon in this question.</p>
<p>The British once reported about the twins Thomas and Stuck. Thomas was a five-year-old child. He lived not far from Manchester. He and a group of children were busy setting up a tent. One of the older children wanted to use an axe to nail the wooden piles into the ground. When he raised the axe to prepare to hammer the wooden piles hard, he unfortunately injured Thomas's left eye, who was standing behind. Immediately he was sent to the hospital, and the doctor performed surgery on his eyes. Unexpectedly, a few hours later, his twin brother William also felt pain in his left eye, and after sleeping he quickly asked the doctor to see him. Later, their father said that the two brothers could get the same ear pain, toothache or other similar diseases at the same time.</p>
<p>Another strange thing is that when a young man was walking at home, he suddenly felt a severe headache. Soon, he fainted. Twenty-four hours later, he learned that when he had a headache, his twin brother in another city had fallen off a horse and suffered a serious head injury.</p>
<p>The Paris newspapers also reported the simultaneous death of a pair of twin brothers. One of the twins was a woodcarver. He suddenly fainted while walking in the forest not far from Paris. And his twin brother also died in the same forest. The three Baldini triplets in Italy gave scientists even more information. One of the brothers died in Rome due to a car accident. One or two hours later, the second brother died of heart failure without knowing that the first brother had died. On the same night, the third brother died in Milan, and it was also heart disease.</p>
<p>The universe is mysterious, and the fact of twins is also mysterious. When will we be able to discover all the secrets?</p>
<h3>Racial Discrimination</h3>
<p>By Wu Derun</p>
<p>The United Press issued the following dispatch from New York: In the case of white people lynching black people in Carolinian, South America, all 31 defendants were acquitted by the local court and released. White people in the southern states of the United States are rejoicing, but the world sees it as a "violent trial."</p>
<p>It is indeed news and an incredible miracle that such a thing has happened in a civilized and advanced country. The defendants have all admitted to the murder, but they are still acquitted and released. Apart from relying on the "unwritten law" of "racial selling", there is really no other explanation.</p>
<p>Of course, these white people will feel happy. But I think that is just the view of a small group of ignorant people, and the rejoicing may be a fluke and daily. Therefore, in addition to the London Daily Express feeling: "violent trial" is still the "unwritten law" of the United States, most of the southern states also expressed dissatisfaction. The Atlanta Report stated: The conscience of the people has been shaken; this is the government's verdict. The District Times stated: The entire country will be stained by this verdict. The Memphis Commercial Appeal stated: This is a tragic day for the judiciary in the southern United States. The Birmingham Pioneer stated: People in the South also have increased feelings about it.</p>
<p>However, in civilized and advanced countries, after class discrimination is eliminated, racial discrimination still exists, and it is grandly used as a judicial verdict. How can it not arouse people's deep thought and lament!</p>
<h3>Japanese Deaths</h3>
<p>By Chen Zhongsheng</p>
<p>The deaths of Japanese people are still bizarre. In Fukushima Prefecture, there was a 53-year-old man named Honichi Morita, who was defeated by a close friend in the election of the Sakazawa Village Council. In order to express his apology, he resolutely committed suicide by cutting his abdomen. In Tanimura, there was a man named Setsu Yotsumura last week, who was overly saddened by the defeat of the local election candidate he supported, and eventually committed suicide by cutting his tongue. In the crime-ridden Tokyo, there was a 24-year-old named Seki Arai, who threw himself under a train because "After enlisting in the police force, he discovered that the world was corrupt, fickle, and it was better to die than to train as a policeman in a chaotic world."</p>
<p>According to the bulletin of the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Transport, 1,241 Japanese people attempted suicide last year for some reason using the same method, of which 970 were successful. In Tokyo, a former paratrooper, Kanzo Kuriyama, was penniless last month and jumped from the 811-foot-high bathroom chimney to seek death. According to the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office: "This person had previously undergone paratrooper training, and the embers under the chimney were gentle, so he failed to achieve his ambition."</p>
<h3>Wen'an Prison - Random Notes on Reading History, Part Four</h3>
<p>By Xiao Dai</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the background of Zhu Yuanzhang, the Ming Taizu.</p>
<p>The History of Ming says:</p>
<p>"Taizu... Emperor Gao's name was Yuanzhang, courtesy name Guorui, surname Zhu. His ancestors were from Pei, moved to Gouke, and then moved to Sizhou. His father, Shizhen, first moved to Zhongli in Haozhou. He had four sons, Taizu being the youngest... In the fourth year of Zhizheng [of Yuan Dynasty], there was drought, locusts, and a great plague. Taizu was seventeen that year, and his parents and brother died one after another... Taizu lost his support, so he entered the Huangjue Temple as a monk. After more than a month, he traveled and ate in Hefei... Three years later, he returned to the temple. At that time, the Yuan government was disorganized, and bandits rose everywhere... In the spring of the thirteenth year... Taizu recruited soldiers from the village and got seven hundred people. Zi Xing (Guo Zixing) was happy and appointed him as Zhenfu..."</p>
<p>It is by no means an easy task for a person who was a monk to unify the world and become the emperor of the Great Ming Empire. After taking power, he naturally wanted to stabilize his supreme position that had been obtained. So on the one hand, he did not allow the princes to have governing power, and at the same time, he tried his best to increase his autocratic authority in the government. Anyone who insulted this authority was killed without mercy.</p>
<p>Ming Taizu's "suspicion and fondness for killing" is appalling. The Twenty-Two History Notes on the Hu-Lan Prison states: "Only Ming Taizu, who used meritorious officials to seize the world, killed all the people who seized the world after the world was settled. His cruelty was unprecedented. His suspicion and fondness for killing were his nature." Ming Taizu not only slaughtered civil and military meritorious officials but also massacred scholars. This can be roughly seen by looking at the literary inquisition in the early Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Ming Taizu avoided the word "Ze" [則] because the pronunciation of Lan [藍] "Ze" is close to "thief" [賊]. He avoided "Sheng Zhi" [生知] because the pronunciation is close to "monk" [僧]. He avoided "Di Fei" [帝扉] because it is similar to "Emperor is wrong" [帝非]. He avoided "Fa Kun" [法坤] because it is similar to "shaved hair" [髮髡]... At that time, it was impossible to count the number of people who were punished on suspicion. Casual Records of Ancient and Modern Times states:</p>
<p>"Xu Yijian, a professor in Hangzhou, had the words 'Light' under heaven and 'Born' saint, making 'rules' for the world in his congratulatory statement. The emperor read it and was furious, saying: 'Sheng' means monk, because I was once a monk; 'Guang' means miscellaneous hair; 'Ze' sounds like thief. So he was beheaded. The officials of the Ministry of Rites were terrified, so they asked to lower the form of the statement, and the emperor personally wrote the article and spread it to the world. Also, the monk Lai Fu's poem of thanks had the line 'Foreign domains and self-shame, I have no virtue to praise Tao Tang.' The emperor said: You use the word 'Shu,' which means that I am a bad Zhu. You also said 'I have no virtue to praise Tao Tang,' which means that I have no virtue, even if I want to praise me with Tao Tang, I cannot. So he was beheaded."</p>
<p>This is very much like Ah Q, who avoided people saying the words "scab" and "light" because he was "scab-headed," and he hated and resented those who said bright and light words. Like this kind of nitpicking and intentional killing, it was even more intensified in the late Qing Dynasty. Literary inquisition spanned several periods.</p>
<p>For example, during the reign of Emperor Tianqi of Ming Dynasty, Li Guozhen of Huzhou wrote the Ming History Summary (also known as the Ming Book), and his review praised Zhu Shishi, which was later obtained by Zhuang Tingfan of the Qing Dynasty and published to the world in the seventeenth year of Shunzhi. In the eighteenth year, it was reported, so all the editors of the book and the children and daughters of the Kun family were beheaded, involving nearly a hundred people. Pingwang Zhi records:</p>
<p>"Guo Kuian's name was Yan, and Pan Litian's name was Zhang. Their talents were comparable. In the second month of the Kangxi Gui Mao year (Yongli seventeenth year, that is, 1663 AD), they were both implicated in the Zhuang family history prison in Nanxun and were sent to the Hulin military camp. On the fifth day of May of that year, Wu and Pan were both executed in Bizhifang in Hangzhou, along with more than seventy others who died. More than a hundred people were exiled."</p>
<p>Another example is Lü Liuliang of Zhejiang, who advocated nationalism and wrote books against the Manchus. His writings contained a poem that said: "The clear wind is too weak to blow me, and the bright moon never fails to shine on people?" In the fifth year of Yongzheng, Yue Zhongqi, the chief constable of Sichuan, reported to the authorities, and a great prison arose. As a result, Lü Liuliang and his eldest son, Lü Baozhong, and his disciple, Yan Hongda, were all punished for exposing their corpses because they had already died. Lü Yizhong, the second son of Liuliang, was beheaded, and the remaining Japanese children and grandchildren were sent to Ningguta as slaves, and the women were sent to the government.</p>
<p>The Ming and Qing dynasties were equally cruel in killing scholars, but their purposes were different. The former wanted to consolidate their autocratic authority, while the latter wanted to eliminate anti-Manchu thoughts. Therefore, scholars who understood "how to protect themselves wisely" simply closed their doors and studied Lao-Zhuang philosophy like in the Six Dynasties. The sudden rise of textual research in the Qing Dynasty was due to this.</p>
<h3>Story of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>By Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"But, don't forget, you are an only child!" The reasons listed by Zhang Chang were actually not unknown to Lao Zhu, and he also admitted that these reasons were correct, but he could not bear to implicate Zhang Chang.</p>
<p>"Life and death are destined, Lao Zhu, don't think of me as so pampered!" Zhang, who was bold and had a big temper, said very excitedly.</p>
<p>"Well, very good, since you don't cherish your life to make me this friend, what else can I say?" Lao Zhu said with a slightly contemptuous look. Fei Fei also had the same stubborn personality as her father. Lao Zhu said many good words to her, but to no avail. Later, Lan called her over and coaxed her for a while before she reluctantly agreed to go with Lao Zhu.</p>
<p>When he was about to get up, Lao Zhu repeatedly urged Zhang Chang, teaching him to pay attention to not getting infected himself. At the same time, he also wrote down the addresses of the correspondence offices that could be used in Dushan, Duyun, and Guiyang one by one, asking him to find a way to make a phone call or ask someone to bring a letter at any time.</p>
<p>Lu Qian also walked over with a sad face, and without saying a word quickly, he just sighed and walked away again. Zhang Chang took it over and looked, and it turned out to be the gold ring that Lu Limper often wore, which everyone often teased him was a wedding ring. Lao Zhu also saw it, and smiled at his back.</p>
<p>"Poor friends are all good!" he said to himself.</p>
<p>Zhang Chang hesitated for a moment, and finally hid the ring in his pocket. "Lu Limper is stubborn, and you can't argue with him. Besides, Mrs. Hu's illness is too severe, and it may take many days to delay. Thank him for me!" he said to Lao Zhu.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu nodded slightly.</p>
<p>Guan was carried by two male team members in a shaking chair. When the driver saw it, he seemed to want to go back on his word again. After Zhu Zhaonian and Zhang Chang repeatedly persuaded him, he reluctantly agreed with the condition that "he would only go to Hechi and would not be allowed to go up again no matter what."</p>

Dai Xiaozhong, head of the Public Service Section of the Post Office, accompanied the vehicle on its tour, explaining the services and conveniences of the mobile post office to the onlookers. Citizens praised the convenience. The services offered by the mobile post office are no different from those of a regular post office branch, including the sale of stamps and the acceptance of various types of mail, as well as small remittances. Two postal workers are assigned to the vehicle, and a representative from the Telegraph Bureau also accompanies the vehicle to receive domestic and international telegrams. Yesterday, the mobile post office received 900 ordinary letters, 40 registered letters, 140 express letters, and 140 airmail letters of various types, totaling 1,220 items, but no remittances. It is reported that starting next week, two more mobile post office vehicles will be added, bringing the total to three, including the one already in operation. At that time, the routes can be extended, the number of stops increased, and the duration of each stop can be increased from 15 minutes to half an hour.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>Xie Yinqiu asks: I have several legal questions and would like you to answer them: (1) According to common custom, children all take their father's surname. Is there an explicit provision in the law regarding this? (2) Under what circumstances can children take their mother's surname to preserve the lineage? (3) What is "surnaming"? Please explain in detail. (4) Under what circumstances can a surname be changed, and what are the legal procedures?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yapu's answer] (1) According to Article 1059, Paragraph 1 of our country's current Civil Code, "Children take their father's surname." Therefore, children taking their father's surname is not only a matter of custom but also stipulated by law. (2) Children may take their mother's surname under the following circumstances: (A) Children born to a husband must take their mother's surname according to Article 1059, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, unless otherwise agreed; (B) Children born out of wedlock all take their mother's surname unless legal procedures have been completed to obtain the status of legitimate children. (3) Adding another person's "surname" to one's own "surname" is called surnaming, such as a wife taking her husband's surname or a husband taking his wife's surname (matrilocal marriage), etc. (4) According to Article 3 of the Regulations for Reviewing Name Changes, Surname Changes, and Surnaming, promulgated by the Ministry of Interior on June 8, 1933, "A request to change a surname may be submitted under any of the following circumstances: (1) inheritance or returning to the clan; (2) non-Han people requesting to adopt a Han surname." The procedure for changing a surname follows the provisions of Article 7 of the same regulations. Those who apply to change their surname according to Article 3, Item 1 must submit a formal and legal written agreement from family members and relatives waiving or acknowledging the inheritance, or acknowledging the return to the clan, stating the age, origin, residence, occupation, and experience, the names of both parents and their ages and occupations, and obtain guarantees from at least two clan elders and two reputable local businesses, along with two 4-inch half-body photos of the applicant and documents proving their qualifications. After the local county or city government investigates and confirms the information, it shall be submitted to the superior government for review and forwarded to the Ministry of Interior. If the inheritance or return to the clan of the applicant mentioned in the preceding paragraph is in another location, it must also be submitted separately to the relevant county or city governments for investigation and joint review for forwarding."</p>

<h3>Assembly Passes Urgent Motion; Attention to Drafting of Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday's Senate Assembly also discussed several temporary motions: (1) The motion proposed by 39 senators including Xu Jiguang and Wang Zhengting, "Telegraph the Central Government to resolutely implement the constitution as scheduled, quickly prepare for elections in various regions, and fully allow the people to freely elect," stated in its rationale that "It has recently been heard that the number of seats in future elections in various regions will be pre-arranged and distributed by various parties, which is alarming. Our country's general election is just beginning, and various parties have no fixed number of National Assembly representatives or legislators on which to base this. Furthermore, this is not a time of war, so the government cannot arbitrarily allocate seats to various parties with sweet talk and limit them. In particular, the people's right to vote must be exercised freely and fully, and the government must not interfere." As a result, the motion was passed by the Assembly. (2) The motion proposed by 36 senators including Xu Jiguang and Tao Baichuan, "Suggest organizing a committee to investigate all activities that violate the interests of the Chinese people to assist the government in stabilizing society," stated the following measures: "(1) The council shall immediately elect several senators to form a "Committee for Investigating Activities that Violate the Interests of the Chinese People" with responsible persons from reputable social figures and major agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic organizations in the city. The main task is to thoroughly investigate all activities within the city that violate the interests of the Chinese people, obtain accurate results, and publish them to the public when necessary. (2) The council shall send telegrams to the central government and civil opinion organs in various provinces and cities to unanimously launch this organization to ensure that elements with international backgrounds who are lurking throughout the country and orchestrating activities that violate the interests of the Chinese people are exposed for who they are." The Assembly resolved to adopt the motion as is and implement it seriously. (3) The motion proposed by 34 senators including Huang Shijin and Ma Junshuo, "Propose launching a Shanghai Municipal Assistance for Education Movement Committee to reduce the number of students dropping out of school and benefit education," was resolved as follows: The council shall send a letter to the municipal government requesting the selection and appointment of social figures to organize the Shanghai Municipal Assistance for Education Movement Committee. Ma Junshuo, Wang Wei, and others proposed a temporary emergency motion: "Propose urgently telegraphing the national government, requesting attention to the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan and resolutely opposing Japan's joint management of the Ryukyu Islands and obtaining special immigration privileges to Taiwan," which was resolved as follows: Passed.</p>

<h3>Fudan to Resume Teaching; No Decision Yet as of Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Fudan University Faculty Association held a general meeting at Xiangbo Hall at the school at 2:00 PM yesterday, attended by over 110 people, including Wu Lifu, Hong Shen, Chen Wangdao, and Pan Zhenya, to discuss the resumption of teaching and the rescue of arrested students.

<h3>Jiaotong University Faculty and Students Will Continue to Request Bail for Arrested Students</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The issue of resuming teaching and classes at Jiaotong University remains in a stalemate. The six opinions proposed by the student union were reported in yesterday's newspaper. In addition to being used to request Mayor Wu's assistance, which was unsuccessful, the union also submitted the opinion paper to the faculty association for reference.

(2) The arrested students will first be bailed out by the school and return to school to continue their studies. (3) The government will present evidence, which will be reviewed by representatives of the faculty association. During the review, the faculty association may consult with the students. (4) Those with minor offenses will be accompanied by the school to report to the authorities and immediately escorted back to school. (5) Those considered to have committed serious offenses will be handled according to item (B) of the Senate resolution. It is reported that the opinions of the faculty and students have become consistent, and they will continue to negotiate with the authorities on the basis of the above items. Furthermore, Wu Baoyan, president of the school, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is heard that Wu has resigned three times to the Ministry of Education, and the students are trying to persuade him to stay.</p>
