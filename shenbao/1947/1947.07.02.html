<h3>中美通話雜記</h3>
<p>電信局於五月下旬即將中美無綫電話機件裝置完竣，一月來日夜試話，其初成績甚好，近日因太陽黑點，影響通話音波之傳遞，故現通話時間暫定為下午九時至明晨一時。</p>
<p>昨日前往電信局掛號者甚擁擠，共計三十七戶，惟昨夜連吳市長之復話禮在內，僅通話九次，丙本報佔二次，其一係美國紐約赫斯德日報編輯傑克德克致本報採訪主任吳嘉棠，亦為中美商用電話之第一次。某二係本報編憐部致中央社駐華盛頓特派員盧祺新。</p>
<p>電信局長途股為籌備昨日之復話儀式，已試話四通宵，股長伍正達，領班浦小姐曁接綫室六位小姐均已四夜不眠。</p>
<p>無綫電話原有二路，同時可有兩對人通話，不料昨日忽有一路臨時障礙，僅一路可通，故昨下午十時以後催詢電話接二連三，掛號處小姐舌敞層然，接應不暇。</p>
<p>無綫電話發話機在眞如，收話機在劉行，終端機及長途台則設於橫浜橋電信局，故與美通話一次輾轉經過連接，多至數十處，服務人員達數十人。</p>
<p>通話三分鐘收費美金十二元，照官定匯率一萬二千元折合，僅法幣十四萬元，較諸電報價廉，惟電信局則虧蝕累累。</p>
<p>如太陽中黑點不退去，每天通話最多十餘次，照契約規定，來去電話必需我國與美國雙方輪流使用、（即每天通話十次，其五次係我國致美，餘五次係美致我國），照目前登記用戶·已「客滿三日」矣。</p>

<p>强調世界不可分割十時十分，吳市長與舊金山市長拉伯漢開始通話，吳氏首請：「我是吳市長，我要同舊金山市長通話」·擴音機上傳來美方女接綫　員之聲音：「他來了」。隨聞拉伯漢沉重而帶鼻音之「哈囉」聲。吳市長笑謂一拉伯漢市長嗎？你好嗎？天氣怎樣」？拉答：「很好」，吳市長即宣讀賀詞稱：「拉伯漢市長，在這中美復話之時，我能與你通話實感榮幸。茲謹代表上海市民向閣下及舊金山市民致賀。一星期以前，我在上海與閣下相見談話，幾天之內閣下已經過半個世界而飛回美國。此即為科學的進步！幾天以內能遊遍世界，幾分鐘以內能完成上海與舊金山間無綫電話之聯繫。信譽與友誼建築於相互了解上。中美友誼向極濃厚，自帆船行駛時期以來美國即與中國友誼交往，雖在交通尙極遲緩，自新大陸至東方需費時數月甚至數年之時，美國即對中國衷心關懷。現則迅速之運輸與便利之交通將更增進不少此種關懷及兩國人民間之相互了解。尤有進者，世界不能分割，任何一國之問題亦為其他國家之間題，任何一國之苦難將立刻影響於別國，而任何一地之和平與秩序亦能使別地共享。中美關係最為密切，在我們太平洋比方所設法解決之間　，必須獲得太平洋彼方之帮助，今夜中美無綫電話之開放，可謂在中美友誼及合作上進人一新階段。此為又一種工具能使友誼堅固，合作有效，能使通訊及消息傳遞迅速，因而增加了解，天下有如一家我們將以上海與舊金山聯繫如一大城，自太平洋之一岸伸展至太平洋之另一岸」，吳市長宣讀畢，拉伯漢告以：「非常淸楚」。繼即拉伯漢對中美友誼亦致頌詞。是時舊金山為淸晨四時許，故吳市長對拉伯漢祝「早安」，而拉伯漢則回祝吳氏「晚安」。在笑聲中互道再會。</p>
<p>市長與大使　互表慰勞</p>
<p>兩國友誼益臻密切</p>
<p>十點二十三分，吳市長續與在華盛頓之顧維鈞大使通話，顧：「你那邊是夜晚，我這裏却是淸早，你為市民服務辛苦苦」。吳：「不，大使才是為國宣勞」。吳氏繼即寬讀談話稿·略云：</p>
<p>顧大使：現在我們分處華盛頓與上海，中間隔着遙遠的大海與陸地，想不到今天居然能够面對着無綫電講話，又好像覺得近在咫尺了。近代的科學，把時空的距離越縮越短，簡直使我們忘記了天高地遠，渺視了宇宙之廣闊。此刻我們好像置身一室之中，促談談心一般。</p>
<p>有人歌頌科學的萬能，也有人咒咀科學的萬惡。今天我們面對這個傳音器，親聽着遠方好友的話語，却不能不向科學致農誠的崇拜與敬仰了，或許我們可以說，科學的本身，是沒有付麽善惡的。</p>
<p>顧大使：當我們今晚在這裏面對着無綫電話談天說地時，一定有不少的中美人士，於茶餘餐後，閒話中美國際無綫電話恢復通話的新聞。他們也許會覺得中美兩國的入民，從今天起又增加了一種交換消息的方法。中美兩國傳統的友誼，又多了一層聯繫了</p>
<p>不錯。中美國際無綫電通話恢復後，非僅減少了兩國人民的隔膜，增加了彼此之間的友誼。還有那旅美的華僑，他們對於祖國素切關懷，而祖國對於他們也同致想念。現在憑着無綫電話，可以互致慰勉之忱。</p>
<p>世界本是一家，戰後的新世界更無庸我們否認這個事實。這種新式電信設備，無疑將使兩國間友誼與合作發揚光大，邁進不止，最後，希望顧大使時常把華府的好消息帶給我們，同時請轉告美國人士以及旅美僑胞，多多地跟我們通話，敬祝顧大使健康。</p>
<p>讀畢大使對無綫電話之清晰極表欣慰，並請吳市長便時向蔣主席及孫副主席等致意，並詢問上海情形，吳市長告以上海甚為安定，轉詢大使何時可回國一遊？大使答稱須俟工作告一段落始能返國小憇，談話至十時三十分完畢。</p>
<p>其次郁局長及國際電台宗管理工程師，復先後代表中國交通部與美國電報電話公司代表湯姆遜通話，最後放映電信局業務電影，電信局並以茶點招待來賓，復話典禮深晚始結束。（本報與美國通話　載見第二版）</p>

<p>本報記者與德克君之問答</p>
<p>來話</p>
<p>來自美國的電話，在晚上十一時接通，乃田紐約美國日報編輯傑兄。德克（Jack　Tncder）打給本報採訪主任吳嘉彙君。吳君在前晚接到電訊局通知，說有一位德克君將打電話給他，果然在昨日按時通話。</p>
<p>原來德克君並不認識吳君，僅在外國報上看到他發出去的電稿，所以在通話前，先問他會不會說英語。</p>
<p>接着德克君問他的第一句話是：「上海美金黑市價格多少？」當吳君告訴他這是遠犯法律的，不便奉告。德君不禁大笑。下面是他們的對話：</p>
<p>德克：「美國兵在上海還有多少？」</p>
<p>吳：「人數很少，約在二百左右。」</p>
<p>德克：「他們行為如何？」</p>
<p>吳：「很好。」</p>
<p>德克：「日本兵還有沒有？」</p>
<p>吳：「差不多都回去了，僅有少數技術人員留着。」</p>
<p>德克：「今天上海各報上所載的最大的新聞是什麼？」</p>
<p>吳：「中政會及中常會聯席會議，決定加強剿共軍事。」</p>
<p>德克：「上海氣候怎樣？」</p>
<p>吳：「最一高八十二·三度。」</p>
<p>後來因吳君問他今天紐約的氣候怎樣？德克回答是八十度。</p>
<p>這時，接綫生報告通話時間已到，談話就終止。</p>
<p>盧祺新與本報記者之問答</p>
<p>去話</p>
<p>本報與中央社駐華盛頓特派員盧祺新之通話，於今晨零時十七分開始接通。亦係中國打往美國之第一隻電話。記者在總編輯室內與遠在七千五百零九哩外之盧氏談話時，語音淸晣，有晤談一室之感。談話前後歷時十一分鐘始畢。當盧氏與記者談話時，係在華盛頓中央社辦事處內，時値中午，陽光普照，暑氣逼人，寒暑表上正高掛九十度。</p>
<p>盧氏於電話中首先對本報總編輯陳訓　及同仁致意。繼之正式開始談話。記者首先問及關於中常會中政會聯席會議中所決定加強剿共軍事一點，美國方面有何反響？處氏稱：「美國各大報本日曾各以大字刋出，但無反應」。記者又問：「目前美國一般人士對中國問題之看法如何」？盧稱：「此次美國報界巨擘乘汎美機週遊世界歸來後，曾對中國問題發表談話甚多，因此美國人士對遠東及中國問題又發生了興趣。譬如說：克利扶蘭正言報發行人白樂明的意見：認爲美國在共產主義與民主主義之間，　　一定要選擇戰略上重要的及能够復興的國家加以支助；他以為美國在中國，日本和菲律濱能够有所致力。他說，中國是遠東最危險的地方，</p>
<p>基督敎嚴言報總主筆凱能氏說：印度和中國都面臨了很嚴重的崩潰的危機。中國的國民政府正遭遇到嚴重的困難。但是中國並沒有必然要崩潰的理由。如果能以國民黨當年從事革命時候的精神來代替今日政府官吏的自私和貪汚，則許多當前的困難，就都可以迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>最後，盧氏復稱：「今晨　維鈞大使和奧市長通話後，到渠談稱：此次中美無綫電話通話，是重新開展過去經常的通訊綱，並從此更可建立戰後國際通訊的機構。中美兩國位於太平洋東西兩岸，對樹立世界和平，與爭取國際間安定，皆有共同及互惠之目標，同時中美兩國對商業之復興，及謀求人民間之繁榮，亦皆抱同一之旨趣。是以今日通話最重要之一點，可增進兩國人民問之瞭解」。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>日本紡織業不應擴充！</h3>
<p>中國紡織學會以麥帥偏護日本本織工業，不允列入賠償拆遷之列，且復有擴充日本紡錘至六百萬錠之說，以爭取國際貿易市塲，該會特於會員大會後，向麥帥提出抗議書，原文刊載六月二十九日本報。此項抗議書為我國工業學術團體，直接向麥帥所指出，並不代表政府意見，純係我國民間意識，亦可謂我國輕工業學術界，對於麥帥管制日本政策之反響。這一反響，究是「強烈的」，抑「微弱的」反響，要看麥帥的回聲，此際為時尙早，我們不便遽然推斷。但這一關係我國紡織工業前途的大事，輿論界物不能沉默無言。</p>
<p>日本是由輕工業躍進為重工業的國家，資本的集中，經營的獨佔遂以武力攫奪原料市塲，並獨占商品市塲，結果爆發了侵略戰爭。波茨坦宣言規定：「日本應以工廠設備，作為賠償，其保留之工業，以維持其平時經濟生活為限」。此項規定的精神，是為了限制日本的工業，從而以賠償來控制日本經濟發展，頗有遠識。日本接受波茨坦宣言將兩年。關於賠償問題，迄今尙懸而未決，各國均有其個別的計劃，意見未趨一致；而最受注意和衆所週知的為美總統賠償專使鮑萊氏報告書，及美軍部賠償委員斯特萊克氏報告書。該報告書等，對於日本紡織業之保留，鮑萊主張紡錘維持三百萬錠，日人也說並不苛刻；斯特萊克計劃則略示寬大，並提出意見說：「日本戰後喪失了東北，台灣，朝鮮等她，已付代價至鉅，日本工業水準及保留的工廠設備，應使之提高」。遠東委員會以此為根據於今年四月通過決定維持日本一九三〇至一九三四年工業水凖。查一九三〇年為日本資本主義飛躍之年，「九一八」事變卽於翌年發生：一九三三年為日本代替英國為世界第一紡織工業國家之年，一九三四年工業貿易之猛晋，更由紡織工業重心的時代，進入五金機器化學物品等重工業為重心的時代。</p>
<p>我國對於遠東委員會之決定，甚表扼腕，識者認係美國武裝了日本，曾於輿論方面表示抗議　　。所謂「履霜則堅泳至」，遠東委會旣開其端，麥帥復創其制，除放任日本恢復工業及貿易活動外，近更允於南極捕鯨，帛琉羣島採磷，逆料對日和會召開前，日本經濟發展，可能蔚成大觀。至於日本紡錘之保留，依鮑萊之調查，戰後日本現存紡錘二·七一八·〇〇〇錠，將來最多維持三百萬錠足矣，但麥帥則以日本紡織業，並非軍需工業可比，擬令擴充至六百萬紡錠，除百五十萬錠生產維持日本人民需要外，過剩生產悉數輸出，藉以活潑日本貿易。此項消息尙未完全證實，如果確成事實，中·英·印·澳各國紡織工業，又將重逢強敵，前途堪虞，想明快的麥帥，或不致陷此錯誤，而搖動波茨坦宣言的精神吧！</p>
<p>事實上，日本紡織工業，如和平的發展，並不需要以龐大紡錠數字為基礎，以美國工業眼光，衡量日本工業設備，結論是錯誤的。第一，據中國紡織學會計算：日本全國人口七千萬，以每人每年棉布二十碼計，至多有紡錠百三十萬錠供給有餘，不需維持三百萬錠以上：第二，日本因棉花原料之不足，戰後二百七十餘萬紡錠多未開工，據我國紡建公司所獲報告，日本現已由二百五十萬錠减為二百十萬錠，可能再降百九十萬錠。如強欲擴張生產，必進而覬覦華北及印澳棉花原料，未來糾紛必演國際禍亂無疑；第三，戰後日本之復興，正作多方面的努力，熟練工人已感不够。紡織機器於戰時多改為重工業，生產軍需品，改裝甚不易。如紡錘擴充至六百萬錠，日本必將進而要求美國的借款，及技術的機器的援助。今天美國的政策，能援助戰敗國的發展，而坐視同盟國失去復興機運麼？第四，我國紡織生產不能與日競爭，需要與日維持平衡發展關係。日紡錠每分鐘可轉動一萬次，我國僅能轉運六七千次：日本每日工作廿四小時，現為十六小時，其勞動力之緊張，蘭開夏亦望塵及。如六百萬紡錠，在優良管理技術下活動，世界紡織業莫敢與之對壘，所以說日本紡織業的再發展，實為世界和平的威脅。現在中英澳等國，惶惶不安者卽在此。</p>
<p>以上論證說明日本現有紡錠，已到達了飽和點，并不需龐大的數字；如不衡量世界局勢，遽然准其過度過高之擴充，必重演遠東的紛亂，而威脅世界和平。我們對美國管制日本的政策，不願作感情的批評，不過我們要聲明，所謂工業水準是比較的，美國人不能以美國標準去看日本，更不應以戰前水準去衡量一切。戰後各國家的經濟，很少恢復到戰前，尤難够美國標凖，這是事實。希望美國朝野，正視此一事實。東京盟軍總部如稍不察，一口氣就准日本紡錘擴充至六百萬錠，或多或少未顧慮同盟國的死活，迫使遠東國家岌岌不可終日，的確是可憂慮的事。　　　　中國舫織學會的抗議書，乃此種憂慮情緒下的呼聲，且為英澳等國之共鳴，對於麥帥是一種友愛的希望，於事於理，并非張皇其說，希望麥帥作明智的抉擇，而以事實告慰於盟國人士！同時我們必須指出，對日和會應早日召開，合理解決這些懸而待決的問題。我國與日本，應速樹立和平經濟關係，將中日兩國可能衝突的生產，成立協定，藉以恢復正常貿易，建立和平生產關係，這纔是中日兩國前途之幸。</p>

<h3>外長會議似秒殺有轉機　皮杜爾提新方案　內容與蘇建議略見接近　今日將繼續舉行會議作最後嘗試</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎廣播：三外長今日第四次會晤減亦即最後一次會臨，　西兩大　團之破裂，殆已無可避免，因對於實施爲歇爾計劃，英蘇之意見極爲　殊也。開會地點仍在法外交部，貝文先到，笑容可掬，一分鐘後，莫洛托夫亦蒞臨，極爲嚴肅，莫氏原有顧問七人偕同前來，但今日則僅三人而已。又訊：外長會議今日開會後。討論一小時另四十分，即吿峻事，莫洛托夫步出法外部，照情形觀之，會議殆已完全失敗。莫洛托夫步出會塲後九分鐘，貝文亦隨之離塲。記者詢以會議是否已吿終，貝文答謂「尙未」」，旋據正式消息，外長會議明日仍蔣</p>
<p>又訊：在今日外長會議時，皮杜爾會有新建議，據莫洛托夫表示，此項新建議並無特殊之點，但願予以考慮。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎一日廣播：外長會議，今日因法方甚出折裏方案，而免於破裂。法外長之折衷方案，計有兩點與前不同。（一）在若干方面，與莫洛托夫昨日之提案相似。（二）歐洲生產之調査，決不干涉會員國之內政或侵害其主權。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎卅日電〕具文，皮社爾，莫洛托夫今日下午舉行第三次會議，開會三小時之久，據可靠方面息，三强會議預料當不待協定之成立，於星期二宣吿結束。可靠方面謂：今日開會時，貝文會事槪述執行馬歇爾計劃各機構之建議，莫洛托夫亦提出反建議，內容與莫氏在前次會議中提出之意見，無甚出入。三强外長於星期二當繼續開會，屆時莫洛托夫可能將再發表聲明，但一般人士今夜咸覺會實際上已吿結束。目前三外長已不復有議定共同經濟計劃之機會。貝文今日概述之計劃，規定設立綜合委員會，草具今後四年內之歐洲復興計劃。此外並主張設立四特種委員會，研究煤斤，鋼鐵，糧食，選職等問題，於八月十五日以前提出報吿。各歐洲國家除西班牙外，均將被徵求意見。惟各委員會之人數則將予以限制，例如綜合委員會之委員，以英法蘇及其他至多四國合組而成。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎卅日電〕此間有資格觀察家頃談稱：英國外相具文今日闡明英國對馬歇爾經濟援歐計劃之見解後，益使英法二國之立塲趨於相同，但奧蘇聯則互相縣殊。貝文外相與皮杜　外長皆强調歐洲國家須合作莫擬此項復興計劃，不然難以邀得美國政府或國會予以切實援助。但蘇聯外長莫落托夫則力言無需此類措施，祇須設立一情報機關彙集歐洲各國需要情形之資料已足。並謂蘇聯政府並不反對設立十中央機構成技術委員會，負責調査歐洲各國之需要情形，作爲援助計劃之根據，但不得踰此一任務之範圍，蓋要旨惟在請求援助興取得美元而已，故無擬具類似泛歐洲計劃之必需也。貝文外相認爲莫洛托夫之建議無異向美國要求一張「」空白　票」，結果必爲其拒絕，殆無疑義十。</p>
<h3>蘇如拒絕參與歐洲復興　美不致變更計劃　今後將由英法單獨進行</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓一日電〕國務卿馬歇爾頃已接得關於巴黎歐洲復興會議之正式報吿，該報吿表示蘇聯或將退出會議，但馬帥對此並未發表意見。另悉，蘇外長莫洛托夫之拒絕參與馬歇爾計劃，似不致使美國政府有任何重大改變云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎一日電〕巴黎三國外長會議殆將在完全失敗中結束。鑒於歐洲必將分爲蘇聯治下與西歐經濟兩集團，英法現已加緊連絡西歐各國準備馬歇爾計劃，英法或將出面邀請所有願意參加馬歇爾計劃之國家。外交界訊，英法將定九月一日爲向美國提出整個計劃之最後日斯。外交界建議之所謂西歐集團，應包括英·法·比·荷·盧森堡·瑞典·議大利與德國之西部，北歐諸國因若千在地理上以及經濟上與蘇聯有聯緊，故是否加入西歐集　當不能一定。葡萄牙之是否參加，亦不能一定。致於西班牙則法國已將其除外。而波蘭與南斯拉夫僉信在蘇聯拒絕參加時，彼等亦將撤銷其要求參加之請求也。</p>
<h3>英駐美大使　不談外長會議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅日電〕英國駐美大使印佛傑貝爾勛爵今晨與美國國務卿馬歇爾會晤，對於巴黎三國外長會議之進展情形、有所商談。事後向報界發表談話稱：吾人對於三國外長會議之進展，表示悲觀。據稱：余曾與馬歐爾國務卿討論聲個局勢，吾人對於三國外長會議以少提爲佳，余定於七月二日離此遄返倫敦，勾留數星期，將向政府當局有所請示云。據此間主管方面稱：英國駐美大使現正不斷以三國外長會議之發展情形，通知美國政府，美並未派遣正式視察者出席是項會議云。</p>
<h3>外長會議取消新聞封鎖辦法</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎卅日電〕三强外長會議自於上週五開始後，至今始揭開秘密之幕，此因蘇聯塔斯社兩次破壤秘密協定，遂決予取消云。</p>
<h3>美對外援助　不以歐洲爲限</h3>
<p>美商長哈里曼吿記者稱</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓卅日電〕商務邵長哈里變頃向報界發表談話稱：今“之世界，需要美國援助當，當不以歐洲爲限。美國對於日本，朝鮮黨其他國家，均負有責任。吾人對於歐洲復興所需要之金錢及物資，當以同情態度加以考慮，是否給予，唯有國會始能決定。財長史奈特所主持之全國諸論委員會，對於　　爾國務卿之援歐計劃，並無不同之意見。哈氏即將偕農業部長安特遞赴德視察，大約七月中旬返國。</p>
<h3>美財政盈餘七億五千萬美元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕美口政府頃於本日公佈國家財政情形，計收入四百廿五億美元，支出四百十七億五千萬美元，盈餘七億五千　美元，此爲十七年來之第一次盈餘。</p>
<h3>蘇反對英法建議　謂有干涉小國內政可能　主張設協助委會爭取美援助</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科一日電〕塔斯社今日指責英法欲藉員文及皮杜爾建議之綜合委員會，以控制其他歐洲國家。英法欲以實行馬歇爾援歐計劃之此一執行機構，使歐洲國家之經濟適合英法之需要及美國提出之要求。塔斯社謂蘇聯之計劃，則不能使强國有干涉小國內政之可能性。貝文及皮杜爾提出之建議，意在使小國負担解決英法本身經濟困難之代價。美國之貸款，將用以作餌以艇迫小國。就此點而論，英法之政策正與美國相似。近復有人力言英法建議之全歐經濟計劃，並不在干涉小國之事務，不致影響其主機，但事實顯示正與此等聲明相反。</p>
<p>最近希臘與美國所訂之恊定已經公布，協定之首句幽有承認希臘主權等例有辭句，然於協定成立以後，希臘之生權即一與被侵犯。再如美國對奧之貸款，奧國亦因此成爲美國監督人之附庸。凡此種種，均足釋明蘇聯代表團之何以不贊成英法所提關於執行馬歇爾計劃之建議。負文之建議與法國之計劃相似，着重於設立綜合委員會，以起草今後四年內之歐洲復興計劃，並調和歐洲各國之需要。同時建議由英法蘇三國發動起草整個歐洲之大規模經濟計劃，然後交美國考慮。此舉意義何在，當然不在使英法之經濟置於其他歐洲國控制之下，其意顯然在經由綜合委員會調整其他歐洲國家之經濟，使其適合英法本身之需要及美國所提出之要求。蘇聯之建議乃爲設立協助委員會由三强及其他若干小國調査歐洲國家之需要並助其獲取美國之援助，此一計劃，決無强國干涉小國內部事務之可能性。</p>
<h3>英帝國會議　討論軍事配備　定下週一在倫敦召集</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦三十日電〕聯合王國加拿大，南菲·紐西蘭·澳大利亞·及南羅特西亞等國代表，定於七月七日至廿六日間在倫敦舉行會議，討論軍隊之配備問題。此等會議戰後已曾舉行一次，係本於戰時所得經騐，以討論配備服裝等之改良，俾適應氣候及戰略上之需要。此次討論主題，將爲增加在帝國各部設立熱帶及寒帶試騐站，今在西非洲之拉谷斯，已設有一座熱帶戰術試騐站，在加拿大之邱吉爾，則設有一座北極戰術試騐站，此次會議將不公開。</p>
<h3>國際軍實力問題我贊同英國建議　蘇代表反對遽即提出確定數字</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖卅晶電〕關於國際軍隊實力之估計，五强向聯合國安全理事會所提出之數字，各不相同。中國代表未提出數字，僅謂在原則上贊同英國之提議。蘇聯代表則以時間忽促，未能提出數字。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖卅日電〕聯合國安全理事會本日開會，討論國際軍隊之實力問題，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯對於美國建議主張有陸軍二十師，飛機四千架一事，猛烈加以攻擊，並謂此一重要問題當非三四小時討論所能決定，故余主張由聯合國陸軍參笁委員會正式提出建議云。茲將英美法各國所提出實力分誌如次：（甲）法國提議國際車隊實力包括下列各軍：（一）空軍－轟炸機七百七十五架，戰鬥機三日架，偵察機二百架；（二）陸軍－六師，其中三師爲鐵甲車部隊，三師爲降落傘部隊，十師爲摩托部隊或騎兵；（三）海軍－戰鬥艦九艘，航空母艦六艘，巡洋艦九艘，驅逐艦十八艘至廿四艘，護航船三十艘，水雷掃除艦三十艘，潛水艇十二艘。（乙）英國計劃包括下列各軍：（一）空軍－轟炸機六百架，戰鬥機四百架，其他飛機二百架；（二）陸軍－八師至十二師；（三）海軍－戰鬥艦二艘，航空母艦四艘，巡洋艦六艘，驅逐艦廿四艘，護航船四十八艘，水雷掃除艦廿四艘，潛水艇十二艘。（丙）美國建議包括下十列數安：（一）空軍－轟炸機一千二百五十架，戰鬥機二千二百五十架，其他飛機四百架；（二）陸軍－二十師；（三）海軍－戰鬥艦三艘，航空母艦六艘，巡洋艦十五艘，驅逐艦八十四艘。</p>
<h3>日本新議會昨日復會　片山請早締和約　並望盟國予以經濟協助</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東東一日電〕片山首相一日上午在衆議院致辭，要求早日簽訂斷日和約，並謂日本並不需要領土，但需要盟臘之精神與經濟援助，以復興日本。日本人民已經解除軍　，並正勝利定向民生化大道，日本人民希望日本館儘早加入聯合國。而致力於世界之永久和平。片山認爲盟軍總部重開日本國際私人貿易之決定，有助於日本之復興，殊表欣慰。渠並謂日本目前由於原料之缺乏及工業設備之破損，故經濟極端困難，日本全國必須忍受艱難與犧性，以渡過離關。片山演辭中大部份闡述日本經濟之困難情形，故要求全國支持政府之經濟措　。片山絕萊提及賠償問題，亦未談及對日和約簽訂後之佔領問題。按過去每當國會開幕之際，日首相必先在貴族院政辭，然後再至下議院發表演說，但片山此次破例先在衆院致辭，並定於一日下午在參議院發表間樣演辭云。</p>
<h3>土耳其向美購船</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓一日電〕國務院昨夜宣布：土耳其政府已要求美國以商船十艘售予土國。</p>
<h3>撳鈕戰爭目前尚不可能</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕衆院行政經費委員會頃正討諭海陸空三軍合併之立法案，曾任太平洋艦隊司令之海面航空專家　威爾海軍上將及原子能專家奧斐爾海軍少將卅日在該委員會陳述時、反對空軍之獨立成部。韜氏吿該委員會稱：美國可於數小時內或數日內爲原千彈集團轟炸所消滅一節，「絕對不可能」。韜奧二人並稱：「　鈕」戰爭之發生，至少尙需五年至廿年之久。戰爭一旦爆發，携機原子炸彈者爲重轟炸機而爲高速度之噴射飛機云。</p>
<p>和田發表經濟政策</p>
<p>〔中央社東京一日電〕日本經濟安定本部長官和田雄雄今日下午向日本議會提出報吿，闡邊織復日沐最具體之經濟政策稱，工業增產原於寫制與分配及日本對外貿易之擴展，實爲解決本國日趨衰落之經濟之唯一法門。和田　請日本人民，加倍緊東腰帶，增加輸出。彼鄭重聲明，日本經濟或需煤斤之增產，及其他可資織出之物資。彼稱，日本政府希望以管制原料之分配方法，希望本年內煤斤產量，達到三千萬噸，鍋產量達七十萬噸。日政府預料一九四七年棉紗輸出，可爲往年之兩倍。彼痛斥重要物資流入黑市，並允許對原料加以管制及依優先制加以分配，彼認爲目前日本經濟危機，係由下列原因造成：（一）生產之奇缺，（二）自停戰以來日本消費者需要亟殷，（三）惡性通貨膨脹。</p>
<p>政府徐覆糧食質詢</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京一日電〕日參議院議員市來乙彥曾以書面向政府提出米麥之生產費及主副食品之偸運等七項質詢‘政府亦以書面答覆，其要點如下：（一）糧食徵購價格之提髙，將增加消費者之負担，故不能以生產者片面之立塲決定收購價格。（二）關於（米麥等主要農產物，需在生產計劃，徵購比率，及肥料等生產資財之配給比率之三者形成有機連繫之下，擬定生產計劃。關於此問題，立法方面正硏究中。（三）關於淸滅暗中實買、希國民全體努力，但國民能得有最低限鴨之糧食，實爲先決條件，故須努力糧食之增產。</p>
<h3>北韓會議　賡續舉行</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城一日電〕北韓會議本日下午二時在平壤人民委員會會議應繼績舉行。美蘇代表及北韓人民委員會領袖金日成，金斗鳳，金來，洪　柱等人均出席。會議由勃朗少將主持，舊由蘇代表布鐵科夫中將起立致詞，旋由勃朗少將致詞，說明會議之遺行方式。</p>

<h3>蒙帥抵澳洲　渠不信再有大戰</h3>
<p>〔合衆社參梨一日電〕英國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥昨日抵達爾文港發表演說稱：渠本已「飽嗜戰爭古味」，不信將再有一次大戰。吾人業已受有一次吹遍全世界之暴風，其引起之驚人　浪，須經過長時閒始能平靜。蒙帥之訪澳，目的討論帝國在太平洋之防務問題。</p>
<h3>麥帥對日寬大英國深表不滿　認爲麥帥改革方案保守性太強</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕英外部發言人表示，英國於美國對日之若干方面，不能滿意，致麥帥與其他佔領國間醞釀已久之衝突，更形尖銳化。官方意見如何，此時尙無從獲悉，惟過去數月中之糾紛則可略述如下：（一）據若干國代表稱，麥帥在理論上爲聯合國司令，但不免過於自主，使美國佔領軍處優越地位，而减少外國參加；（二）英蘇兩國發言人嘗一再批評麥帥之改革方案並不完備，其保守性太强，且對一部份日人過於寬大；（三）中，英，澳等國皆謂麥帥欲减輕賠償，許日本維持較高之工業水準。馬來亞英國官吏，因需要日俘恢復戰時損害，曾反對麥帥之遺俘計劃。</p>
<p>麥帥反唇相稽自詡佔領功績</p>
<p>然在另一方面，麥帥對於國際間之猶豫不決，亦已明白表示不耐，謂美國之優勢佔領，使日本情形不致如德國之失調，幷阻遏共產黨攻勢，美國曾出錢維持日本經濟，其他各國則一毛一拔而欲就日本國事發言。凡事貴乎迅速，尤於經濟爲然，麥帥曾一再催促遠東委員會解決日本賠償問題，幷重行決定日本經濟水準，但應保障日入能獲得充分之糧食與其他必需品。麥帥之准許日人二次捕鯨，並開採安加島磷酸鹽礦，即因此決定，否則美國將支出更多金元從事輸入，或引起內部不安，致危害佔領軍隊。日本現欠美國約三百萬美元，而必需品之進口正在迅速增加。</p>
<p>日本民主程度各國尤表懷疑</p>
<p>麥師及其發言人嘗反覆發明民治主義將留在日本，許多外國代表及一部份較公正之觀察員均不以爲然，惟麥帥則謂佔領軍祇能吩咐作若干改革，其餘當由日人自動進行，就此點而論，佔領軍之任務實際上業已完成麥帥主張中庸的政治經濟哲學，此較蘇英澳洲所希望者更偏於保守，三國發言人已屢言之矣。</p>
<p>盟總發表聲明答覆英國抗議</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京一日電〕麥帥總部今日發表特別聲明，答覆最近英國等對於准許日本派遣南冰洋捕鯨隊與開採安加島磷礦工事之抗議，據稱，「如謂此舉威脅盟國中任何」國之經濟或軍事安全，顯甚可美」。至於所稱事先未與英國興澳洲等政府討論一節，亦屬不確。美國政府授檀本部批准該項計劇以前，即已商諸有關各國政府。</p>
<h3>英美銀團對日貸欵盟軍總部已予拒絕　反對原因爲利率過高</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京卅日電〕記者頃自最可靠方面獲悉，英美銀團曾自動提出對日貸款五千萬磅，但盟軍總部已予拒絕。此事係目前提出，數日前盟總宣佈反對，其原因爲利率過髙，及其他條件苛刻。英美銀國欲獲百分之三·五利息，連同其他佣金，年息約共需百分之四，盟總堅持最髙限度應在百分之二·八左右。至貸款之保證及典押，則未經討論，按英美銀團爲各方面所提對　貸款事中之最肯定者，而美國半官方或私人資本對日貸款美金十億元事，刻正在華盛頓與東京進行討論。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社新德里一日電〕印督蒙巴頓今晨與印度各領袖討論英國以主權交與未來印度兩分治國之歷史性的草案，該案或將有若干修正，然後提出英國內閣，再由下院討論之。</p>
<h3>加批准四國和約</h3>
<p>〔路透社滬太華三十日電〕加拿大衆院已於今日通過批准對義·匈·羅·芬等四國和約，討論時加總理金氏對於四張起草和約之際，不使小國有適當之發言權，深致不滿。</p>
<h3>英埃清算倆務成立臨時協定</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社三十日電〕關於英埃兩國淸理英國所負埃及之金鎊償務一事，雙方舉行談判日有多時，頃悉：兩國業已成立臨時協定。其有效期限至本年底爲止。是項協定可使埃及暫時能應付目前之財政淸形，其復雙方當繼續舉行談判，以成立期限較長與包括雙方所保留各項問題之協定。此項臨時協定內容，可望於本月三日公佈。</p>
<h3>美駐印大使昨呈遞國書</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新德里一日電〕第一任美國駐印大使格蘭迪今日假蒙巴頓官邸，在簡單儀式中呈遞國書。格閘迪稱：「六年來美國未曾有代表在此呈滬國書，而自今日起，在印美二國間已建立新的興更直接之關係矣」。</p>
<h3>印尼組閣獲協議　傳夏利福亭將出任總理　美進出口銀行保留對印尼貸款</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴達維亞一日電〕頃悉：印尼共和國新閣名單，或將於本日午後公佈，各政黨對此今已獲致協議。前任國防部長夏利福亭或將出任總理一職，副總理或將有三人之多，前任總理沙利或將被任爲駐英國或美國特使。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞一日電〕據共和國方面訊，今晚新內閣成立時將答覆美國之照會，新內閣將爲聯合政府形式。重要職位均分配予四大黨，次要職位由其他各黨分任。同時前國防部長夏利福亭在新聞招待會上稱：印尼共和政府，願接受一「超機構」，此項機構，將造成一臨時時期，直至一九四九年一月九日。夏氏稱：規定於林牙蒂條約中之共和政價之目標。渠說明「超機構」對於荷蘭即尼聯邦並無關係。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓卅日電〕據美國進出口銀行方面本日談稱，該銀行目前仍指定一億美元之貸款撥給局勢改善〔後之印度尼西亞。據稱，此項貸款在一九四五年九月間早已指定，但印尼情勢不久即吿決裂，故未予撥給。</p>
<p>英報評論印尼局勢</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦卅日電〕關於美國照會印尼共和國，要求印尼與荷蘭合作，迅速組織印尼臨時政府一事，頃由曼徹斯特導報發表一文，加以評論稱：此舉爲防止印尼與荷蘭間發生戰爭之最後一分鐘之努力。目前之局勢，紊亂異常，極爲危險，印尼若認爲荷蘭之建議，不過欲使其在戰爭與無條件投降二者之間，有所抉擇而已，印尼殆將選擇戰爭之路綫，彼等深知戰爭將使荷蘭分裂，與其將使印尼分裂初無二致。反之，印尼若認爲其接受設立臨時政府之議，並不使討論意見紛歧之各點，成爲不可能，則彼等之能度可能略爲妥協。</p>
<h3>猶太伊爾根團體允停止恐怖行動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社耶路撒冷三十日電〕頃自可靠方面探悉：猶太伊爾根恐怖團體，曾與聯合團調查委員會在泰拉維夫進行秘密會議，聞猶太代表已向調查員保證停止恐怖行動。</p>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷一日電〕此間市中心區今晨傳有槍　安發生，軍隊立即馳往彈壓，並鳴汽笛示警。全城頓陷於緊張狀態。但經搜索結果，當局宣布此事係出誤報，二十分鐘後遂予解除</p>

<p>極端右派圖覆政府</p>
<p>法政府在一九四六年炒即獲悉黑林黨之存在，係由極端右派份子保王派，擁護維希政府之人士，以及以前之通敵者組織而成，其目標乃在以武力攻擊共和國，然後以一種性質不明之臨時政體取其地位而代之。旋於本年三月間，送政府獲悉黑林黨已擬定一項攻擊計劉，名爲「藍計劃」，將在七月杪或八月六日付諸實行，陰謀份子擬先在勃里泰尼省之梵納斯聖方劫獄，以釋放黑林黨以前某一領袖（因殺死某職俘之　而劫獄者）。警局於接獲上述種種情報之後，即開始偵査，於本日廿四日派探員前往伏爾班伯爵之寓所搜査，抄出大批作戰命令，秘密訓令及公吿等。伏爾班佰爵本Ｗ　亦就逮，因物證俱在，不容易狡賴，故直認陰謀之存在不諱。伏爾班柏爵在受審時並調，法國憲兵總監季勞杜幽與陰謀有關，警局旋於昨日搜查季勞杜之住宅，並將其人逮捕。</p>
<p>訓令三項嫁禍共黨</p>

<p>由新疆避難來滬之白俄僑民（本報攝）</p>
<h3>新疆邊境白俄不堪威逼出亡　橫貫半中國輾轉到上海　携幼扶老百數十人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕居住於新疆西北邊境之白俄，因長懼某方成迫，不辭長途跋踄，横貫半個中國而走避於上海。據記者調査所得，現已抵達本市之白俄難民已有四十二個家庭，共計一百四十九人。內最幼者爲生甫兩月之嬰兒，最老者達七十二歲。其中一百十七人，由俄僑協會協助，暫時寄居於貝當路俄國商業學校中。難民共分三批抵滬，第一批於五月十日到達，共計五十人。第二批於五月底到達，共計卅五人。最後一批人數較多，於七月中抵滬。渠等離開伊犁時期，爲去年之十月十四日，先乘馬或步行至迪化，再乘卡車經蘭州抵達西安，再取道隴海津浦鐵路抵京轉滬。途中辛苦備　。據難民之代表語記者：彼等居住伊犁，爲時已久，有在十五年甚至廿五年以上者，比次因恐懼大禍將至，不得巴而離去。大宗財物，均忍痛拋棄，僅有一部份　蓄之現款，作爲旅費。沿途除得蘭州敎會之協助外，並得新疆甘肅兩省省政府之補助。旅途中無論官吏及民衆，均以友好同情之態度，處處予以帮助，極可感謝。目前寄居之商業學校，恰値暑假，校方供給十二個大小房間、暫作宿舍，一部份有床位，一部份則席地而臥。飲食則分別由俄僑協會及學校供給，本市白俄僑民激於同情心，慨捐衣履甚多，均陳列於校舍前石級上。一部份難民之兒童雖跣足行走，但於夕陽下歌唱遊戲，似已忘却旅途之艱苦。惟無論大人取小孩，對拍照均無興趣，因過去在新省邊疆時，被人攝影爲一危險之事也。</p>
<p>據難民吿記者：我等均有謀生能力，非游民可比，希望能在滬尊得工作，以維生計。惟以不通華語英語，不無困難。渠等能做之工作，不外製皮鞋修鐘錶木匠及汽車按工等。截至此時爲止，一部份年輕難民，已在商店與學校中謀得工作。又白俄難民中，一部份來自伊犁，原因爲要求其接受蘇聯護照，另一部份則來自迪化，該處目前尙無危險，但深恐將來爲伊犁之續，故亦決定遷居。目前已有另一羣難民，爲數約有二百人，已行抵哈密至肅州途中。記者詢以伊犁有無蘇軍，雖民答謂，不穿制服之蘇軍到處可見。</p>
<p>白俄難民過去生活史</p>
<p>此類難民過去之生活歷史，與中蘇邊境上之種族糾紛與衝突，共產黨之宣傳，以及蘇聯控制伊犁河流域之企圖，不可分割。最初移殖於此區者，爲在蘇聯革命中戰敗之哥薩克人，於一九一七至一九二三年間居於庫爾佳一帶。至一九二九及一九三六年時，因蘇聯新憲法之頒佈，陸續有不滿現狀之民族至新疆移殖。估計當時在庫爾佳及迪化之白俄，爲數約二萬人左右，其中不少爲手工業者及技術人員，生活頗爲安定。以後蘇聯之勢力在盛世才之同意下，逐漸侵入新疆，彼等在新省建築機塲，並在省政府谷部門中廣設顧問。至一九四〇年時，省府突命令留居難民出示蘇聯之登記證書。當時難民深感無國籍者在邊境種族衝突中之危險，加以蘇聯顧問乘勢勸誘，結果有四分之三之人數登記，餘者則在任何威脅之下，堅持不屈。至一九四二年時，因英美領事已抵達迪化，及蘇聯忙於對總戰爭，難民之恐懼稍减。比時蘇聯在新省勢力似在衰退之中，白俄難民精神上稍感自由。至一九四四年十一月，種族戰爭爆發，據白俄難民表示：經蘇聯登記之白俄及蘇軍，此次均參加進攻迪化之省主席官邸電力廠及監獄。至一九四五年時，蘇聯對伊犁區控制已吿恢復，此時又要求白俄登記，但庫兒佳縣城之二百白俄家庭堅決拒絕。以後隨即發生所謂「東土而其斯坦共和國」之成立事件。至去年九月時，當地警察開始逐戶盤問白俄。據難民稱：過去有白俄拒絕登記者，常指有與日本通謀之罪名加以拘捕。若輩以遠在一九三三年時，即有大批白俄軍官被捕，禁囚至一九四一年時即行失踪，鑒於危機之日迫，於是遂開始大親模逃進。在最初五個月中，約有三百人逃亡，至今年一月時，當地政府即禁止居民離境，據最近白俄雞民得信：在兩個月前，該區已在戒嚴狀態中。</p>

<p>廣州天津漢口等地　紡調會籌設公棧　負責配銷棉紗運額將不加限制　　〔本報訊〕經濟部次長劉泗英，昨於紡調會會議室，接見記者，就目前紡調施策，答覆記者問，茲摘誌大要如次；　　（一）目前紡調會對紗布調節施策，本市方面，已確立共同配夠制。外埠方面，將計劃先在廣州天津兩地，籌設紗布公棧，漢口亦擬籌設中。各公棧之棉紗，由紡調會及廠商運銷。惟廠商運銷須先向紡調會取得運銷證。稅紗運到各地後，即集中存於各地公棧，由各公棧負責各地之共同配銷，配價以參照上海棉紗議價爲基準。　　（二）將來各地公棧設立後，現有之南運北運辦法，即等於無形廢止。蓋運往各地之數額，可無限止，視各地需要而定。　　（三）棉紗之外銷，將來亦擬設置聯合外銷機構。除國營廠將以其目前生產量百分之二十提供外銷外，亦望民營廠能照目前產量增產百分之二十提供共同外銷。　　（四）經部擬在南洋一帶，設置若干調査機構，俾先調査南洋各地需要棉紗，及其製品之種類式樣，俾供國內外銷之參考。　　（五）査目前國民營紗廠產紗，百分之七十俱屬廿支紗，至少該部份之棉紗，將全部提供紡調會，作共同配銷之用。　　（六）現以國民營紗廠產紗，均已提供共同配銷，過去政府收購棉紗，可不再續辦。　　（七）自棉紗有議價後，其他各種棉紗複製品，亦需根據棉紗之議價，議定合理價格。　　〔又訊〕據茶紡織權威觀察：目前政府對紗布調節施策，首要在爭取合理及有效之分配。蓋合理之分配，較抑低紗價尤屬切要，故產生共同配銷制。此制實施無效，或將進而考慮代紡代織劍。再不然，則將進而舉辦產銷登記，實行全面統購統銷政策。至收購棉紗，以政府供給外匯關係，恐仍將繼辦。渠指出目前政府對共同配銷制之執行，希望澈底實施共同議價，共同配銷。盼各紗廠以國家社會福利爲重，勿斤斤唯一己私利是圖。惟聞民營廠之意見，希望共同議價，個別配銷，以維持民營廠之營業自由權。　　〔又訊〕某民營廠首腦昨語記者：邇來棉紗市價波動，紡調會爲平穩紗價，臨時權宜之計，乃與各紗廠協議，先試辦共同配銷制，分由國民營紗廠，各提供棉紗一萬件，限本月十五日前繳淸，以供共同配銷。至一萬件以外之棉紗，則仍由各廠自由運銷。且所提供之一萬件，性質係屬供給試辦，並非謂此後每半個月，規定需供紗一萬件云。梧州衡陽匯款亦將加以限制　　近來資金逃避香港及商人套利關係，華南匯率又迭成激劇之波動。國家行局已實行緊縮，中央銀行並限制各商業行莊匯往粤閩兩省款項，每週祇匯五千萬元。是項規定以後，一般不肖商人，又設法匯至梧州，衡陽等處，轉匯華兩，以遂其份外之目的。中央銀行方面，正注意此項事態之發展，亦將加以嚴格限制。青食油運滬辦法定週六開會商討　　關於靑島食油運滬問題，靑市社會局長曹沛滋氏，曾於前日晋京向經濟糧食社會等各有關部院請示，茲曹氏已於昨晨返滬，承向記者表示稱：靑島月產食汕約三千餘噸，而以荳汕爲大宗，當地消耗每月祇須六十噸之譜，如能解決運輸上困難，按期定量運出，足以抑制滬市目前之食油漲風。此次晋京，中樞對原則上已表同意，運輸問題亦允蓋力協助。現曹氏已與本市社會局糧政科長吉明齊商妥，定本星期六召集有關方面，商討如何將靑鳥食油運出供給京滬一帶，屆時對有關各項問題，將作具體之決定。香烟初堅後挫　　昨日捲烟市况，初開納胃尙健，門莊帮需求不寂，嗣聞永泰和對本外埠同行，將派給十支廿支大英與老刀烟，而外埠尙有哈德門烟派配，塲內轉賣者驟衆，十支大英烟上午曾做髙至七百六十九萬，吐售一多，乃挫至五十三萬。　　午後塲上供多求少，市氣步軟，最後低至七百三十五萬五千元，比上日回瀉二十四萬五千元。老刀烟亦跌二十七萬元，爲六百三十五萬元？五華哈德門兩烟脚地較穩，只挫五萬元。髙等燜大南宋三砲台走化轉淸，市亦回小一千餘元。全日情形除美貨條烟，及五十支聽裝烟，市而挺俏外，其餘華商廠烟市勢頗呆。棉織業產銷聯營公司代表　傳良駿等晉京請示　發展我國棉織品南洋市塲　　自美國務院與陸軍部宣佈日本對外貿易，將於下月十五日開放後，我國工業思權威人士傅良駿。徐文照。徐志超。許資新等三十餘工廠負責人，鋻於日本對外貿易，一旦開放，必以其成本低廉而採取低價傾銷政策，與我國競爭南洋市塲。屆時，國產棉織品將於國外無挿足之餘地，不但我國工業，至感威脅，即政府外匯損失必巨。爲擬挽回我國垂危之經濟，爰發起組織「中國棉織業產銷聯營公司」，並已舉行成立大會。聞該公司董事長傳良駿·徐文照二氏，業於昨晚十一時，搭京滬夜快車晋京，面謁經濟部陳啓天部長有所報吿。並望政府領導與協助，俾保持我國棉織品國外市塲，爭取外匯，藉以平衡購入外棉之支出，挽回我國經濟之頹勢云。食糖市勢堅定　　昨糖市趨勢堅定，間有續升。公會劃盤，秘魯砂初爲六十六萬六千元，後爲六十七萬元。二〇中砂白六十萬元，台赤五十七萬五千元，升萬五千元。汕提靑開四十三萬六千元，升六千元。順德靑四十二萬五千元，計百數包。刁靑仍開三十八萬五千元，計一百七八十包。興化白高貨五十八萬五千元，升萬元，次之五十七萬元。興赤四十八萬五千元，升萬餘元，次之四十六萬元，計二百數十裏。東北經委會說明　物資交換辦法　三角鐵電銅板均有商人可向該會申請　　〔本報訊〕工商輔導處頃得東北行轅經濟委員會來函，略謂：經委會並未如外傳之存有大批器材，日前輸出者多由商人自行收購。物資交換辦法分交貨交款兩種，商人可逕向本會申請云云。物資交換辦法，茲舉兩例說明如下：（一）三角鐵每應售價十七萬元，可交換下列物資中之一種：二十支大女紗〇·一七三八件，大五福布四·八一三疋，麵粉五·六一五袋，美孚火油一·七八三桶，美孚汽油二·〇二一桶，白報紙四三三·二磅，麻袋三九·九條。（二）電銅板每團售價三十萬元，可交換下列物資中之任何一稱：二十支大女紗〇·三八四八件，大五福布一〇·四七疋，麵粉一二·七九八袋，美孚火油四·〇六五桶，美孚汽油四·六〇七桶，白報紙九八七·二磅，麻袋九〇·九三條。蠶絲產銷協導委員會　江蘇區督察團報吿　　蠶絲產銷協導委員會爲抽査江蘇省本年春季聯合收繭實施情形，並注意貸款運用及蠶繭處理是否適當，特組織江蘇省督察團，該團係由中議公司李秘書化鯨領導，團員四人，配備技術會計人員，於上月初旬出發，至六月十八日督察完了，業於日前返滬。據發表視察報吿如下：　　（一）收繭量　（甲）無錫區——截至六月八日止，統計約六萬担，預計　續收購數量，約一萬担，共約七萬担。　　（乙）武進區——截至六月十一日止，統計約一萬三千餘担，預計繼續收購，可達一萬四千餘担。　　（丙）吳縣區——截至六月十三日止，統計約一萬六千五百餘担。　　以上全省共計約十萬祖，惟各繭商自款收蘭及合作烘藕者，估計約二萬担，未計在內。　　（二）繭質　蘇省本春，一般成績均佳，每張蠶種收蘭量平均約三十五市斤，最多者達五十餘斤，故繭質今甚優良。除金壇·丹陽·宜興·溧陽一帶，間有少數土種及改良土種之蘭質較遜外，其餘均品質優良，估計烘折約二百七八十斤，繅折約四百一二十斤，其中最優良可達三百七十斤。　　（三）繭價　蘇省本春蘭價，較浙省爲髙。按全省分區論，以武進區較廉，每担平價扯價約一百十七八萬元。宜溧一帶，因地方情形特殊，扯價較髙。其中最髙扯價曾達一百卅一萬元，因繭質尙佳，與規定標準價尙無大差。　　（四）感想　（甲）本春各區收購，均以環境關係，影響收蘭數量，佔計未能收到繭量，約達二三成。此等達繭量，蠶農或自行繅製土絲，或行零烘，或晒繭等處理，大好原料而致淪失，殊爲可惜。　　（乙）本會實施聯合收繭，可以避免廠商競租繭行，及相互抬價競收之流弊。　　（丙）繭行陋習，一時未能完全消除。增加繭行開支，是爲憾事。亟待將來中央蠶絲監管機構成立，依法監管，俾易就範。　　（丁）蠶農因本屆一般繭價提髙，增加收益，刺激農民養蠶心理，故各處桑園，均已翻土，準備施肥，對於盤業復興，大收成效。　　（戊）各參加收滿廠商，均能共體蠶絲產銷計劃之方針，恪遵規定辦理，甚爲難得。聯總棉花　尚有六萬包未到　易得棉紗供救濟之用外一部份助當局抑平紗價　　行總各倉庫現存棉花六六·三八四包，以易紗方式，配售予各紗廠。茲據該署某負責人吿稱，聯總運華棉花，共有十八萬包，除已配售及擬配而尙未配出，現存倉庫者外，尙有六萬包未到。此項棉花，以後陸續裝船，運來，俟到滬後，將繼續配售。記者詢以棉花易得之棉紗，將如何分配，是否裝運出國銷售。據稱：本署棉花過去每担以國幣七十五萬元售與紗廠，原有收購棉紗產量一成之規定，此項收購之紗，作爲救濟之用。此番新辦法雖規定配售棉花完全易紗，但絕對不運銷國外。一部份將擴充救濟之用，一將份將攷慮供當局抑平紗價，或配售，或出賣，究用何種方式，尙在計劃中。紡建循例售布　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日術例售布，共售三三七五〇疋，被單一六六〇條。廠商申購共二四戶，共購布九六〇疋。布號申購單共一四一〇張，共購布三二七九〇疋，被單一六六〇條。　　龍口粉步昂　　線粉干茲以靑島來訊，一日數漲，合價日髙，申市亦逐步上展。如龍口粉行　昨市已近一百八十萬元，可見髙昻一斑。肥皂火柴挺俏　　昨日雖値銀錢業結息休假，皂燭市塲仍照常開市，塲中業外拉提甚勁，兼以原料報漲，廠家派貨拖延，市上籌碼頗形枯竭，在貨主居奇之下，市勢飛黄騰達。下午因有獲利吐售，市價乃步見下挫。但收後塲外市氣仍挺，照掛牌加價有成交，故脚地頗硬。　火柴市勢亦以原料價貴，塲上求多供少，做價節節上漲。美麗鳳凰兩牌銷路特暢，每箱猛漲十三萬至十萬元。美麗收價爲二百九十五萬元，鳳凰脾昂至三百萬大關。其餘南京寗波玫瑰等牌，亦跟升二三萬至七八萬元不等。　　皂燭原料軋升　　皂燭原料市面，近因各方進取頗強，行情挺升。月牌燒碱每桶價爲一千萬元，軋升五十萬。美燒碱爲九百八十萬元，挺升三十萬元。司的令亦漲三十萬，每担價爲四百五十萬元。髙度白臘軋升十萬元。司馬担價爲一百七十萬元。椰子油現交升一百八十萬元，惟香草油N松香仍維原盤。　　油臘類本街吸納亦勁，市勢續挺。本淘油漲至司馬担一百廿五萬元，禾本油自九十萬步昻至一百〇五萬元軋升十餘萬元，尖麻插雪津市荆油等價，俱升七八萬元。米心牙口每担均昂至六百五十萬元，軋升七十萬元。平水茶農請求救濟　　紹縣平水，王壇，王化，湯浦等各區茶農茶廠，不能開展業務，毛茶未得出路，多數茶農飢餓交迫，乃於六月二十七日推舉代表冀南榮·宋順源。宋干生·宋念吾·周光仁等，具文向各方謂顧，略謂戰前平水綠茶，譽滿國際，去年五月間，中國農民銀行貸款茶廠，收購毛茶，市價僅每担九萬元，（合米一担半）與戰前相較，减低三分之二弱，（戰前毛茶一担，可換米四担）當時茶價雖賤，銷路尙靈，茶農不够成本，至迫不得巳時，亦願賤售兌現。本年春學，中國農民銀行，辦理茶廠登記，派員調査，組織茶廠，風起雲湧，就茶區附近新舊茶廠之設置，約有百家左右。南榮等以茶廠突然增加，勢必國外茶銷開展，俱忻忻然有喜色，不惜髙利借貸，採製毛茶，待沽至今，無一家茶廠開門，先後探詢原因，據吿三十五年箱茶，政府迄未收購，以致茶廠炎金凍結。三十六年度茶貨方案，無毛茶貸款之規定，因此茶廠無炎力收貸，遂成僵持局面。茲代表三十萬茶農，瀝陳苦情，極請迅予設法救濟云云。</p>

<p>美國電影界的「大觀園」二十世紀　福斯公司　採訪實錄  本報好萊塢航訊　駐美特派員毛樹清　　好萊塢有大大小小十多家電影公司，資格最老的是『實球影片公司』據好萊塢的人說：在一九二八年以前，電影的『無聲片』時代，寰球公司曾經出過大風頭。但是，時代過去了，今天雄踞在好萊塢的，是Big　Three：米髙梅，二十世紀福斯公司，華納兄弟公司。論資本，論塲面，論人才的集中，他們都一致公推米髙梅，雖然米髙梅的歷史最短。　　除了所謂『三巨頭』以外，派拉蒙和哥侖比亞，都比較有相當的規模。有時候，也稱作Big　Five。我在好萊塢的短短幾天停留中，參觀了福斯，華納，和哥侖比亞三家，派拉蒙和米髙梅，也替我排好了日子，但是，因爲急於要離開，也就祇能『割愛』了。　　三家之中，以二十世紀福斯公司的塲面最大公司國際宣傳部的職員約翰福耳，開了汽車在廠內團團轉，我祇是聽他一邊說，一邊看，完全迷失了方向和路徑。看電影製片廠，我本來還是生平第一次，第一次就關進了「大觀園」。　　讓我來依稀描寫一下罷，福斯公司的製片廠，全部佔地三百英畝，像一座中古時代的『莊園』，坐落在好萊塢鎭的西南角，在碧蕪山的山麓，洛杉磯開關以前，那兒是鄰近太平洋海濱的荒地，現在全部給福斯公司買了過來。製片廠的大門，是四根大石柱子，比重慶中央訓練團的石柱大門，還要雄偉得多。進大門向右轉，一條寬暢的柏油甬道，一邊是樹林，另一邊是大理石的建築，那是福斯公司的辦公室，辦公室門前，停着一字長蛇陣的漂亮汽車，都屬於寫字間的先生們的　　傳達處有穿警察服裝的司閣司閣雄踞着的客堂裏，掛着十六張第一流明星的照片，有大明星蓓蒂葛蘭寳和泰隆寳華都是福斯公司的臺柱。據約翰福耳說：全部辦公室，有同樣的四十五幢樓房。職員人數共計三千五百人。　　二十世紀福斯公司分南北兩製片廠。他們自己的標語是：『世界最大的製片廠』，『世界最美的攝影塲』。辦公室和行政中心多半在南廠，我走馬看花地坐着約翰福耳的汽車，巡迴一週，化了三個多鐘點。　　我問過很多的人，都有同樣的經騐：看了攝影塲以後，减少了對電影的神秘性，甚至對着電影不發生興趣。美國電影中的『百老匯路』，紐約時報廣塲，幾乎全是他們自己假造的，妙處是在他們假造得一模一樣，一樣寬闊的馬路，一樣髙聳的樓房，一樣的電綫桿子和路燈，一樣的旅館大門。馬路是眞的，他那個『大觀園』裏，到處錯綜複雜的全是馬路。旅館的鋼骨水泥建築，是木板釘的　品，經過油漆粉飾，粗看上去像水門汀一樣。最妙的是那些髙聳着的假樓房，祇有『半幢的』甚至衹有一扇大門，再加一二英尺進深的門面，後邊全用木板粗製濫造的釘着。從前面看，是一排整齊的樓房，從佈景背後看，像一排排髙大的衣櫥。　　立體佈景，堆砌成一座座城鎭和村落，三百英畝的攝影塲內，有紐約的百老匯路轉角，有北菲洲的沙漠城市，有中古時代羅馬敎堂前面的一隅，有凱撤大帝時代古羅馬的宮殿，有西班牙街頭風量綫，有長滿着棕欄樹的南美村落，右墨西哥的滿街的攤販，也有一座四百米長的中國農村。約翰福耳說：那座中國佈景，是很早以前建的，專爲拍攝琪恩泰妮的「中國女郞」而造。「木匠們忙，他們還沒有拆去」！　　每一座佈景，都隔得相當遠，避免攝片時候，彼此的干擾。整個大觀國裏，有好幾百名木匠和泥水匠，這邊拆屋，那邊造屋，他們都是常年職員。這些半頓的建築，城牆，牢獄，路燈，在不攝片的時候，都露天站立在大觀園內，一旦工作的時候，臨時再加上頂蓬，加上燈光，加上收音的設備，然後請演員們工作。　　有一個原則，他們是堅持不變的，便是同一佈景，決不能在兩齣不同的戲裏重復出現，換句話說，就是一個佈景，祇演一劇戲。譬如：演「中國女郞」的那幅鄉村佈景，在另外一個關於中國的劇本之中，決不能偷工减料再用。縱然還需要一幅中國農村社會的背景，他們也得請藝術家先設計，然後再另外建造。有時候，門窗牌坊等等可以移用，但必須重行裝置。　　福斯公司北廠內有精美的游泳池，游泳池畔經常有世界聞名的美女。南廠中間，有大規模的「運河」，有海邊碼頭的建築，河裏有十八世紀的「漂洋船」；有風蓬髙扯的中國帆船，有古羅馬威尼斯河上的小舟，也有一九四〇年敦克爾克撤退時候的小型「救生汽艇」。可惜我沒有看見他們攝製河上的片子，不然，像「梅尼佛夫人」一類的片子，那個熱鬧的攝影塲面，眞够醉人！　　約翰福耳帶我在南廠裏看馬，大大小小有四五十匹，都養得光澤照人。他帶我汽車大隊，從南北戰爭時代的車子，二十世紀初年的車子，到一九四七年的新車，琳瑯滿目，各色都有，他說：他們有時拍關於英國人的片子，常常故意用古老的汽車來陪襯，因爲英國人保守，而且節儉。　　然後，我們繞道室內攝影塲，那是像「健身房」一樣的建築，方方的髙大的房屋，裏邊陳列着各種古往今來的傢俱。在戲劇名目中，呌做「大小道具」，一間「健身房」，可以同時作好幾個佈景，有時候，一塲佈景，祇佔了「健身房」的二十分之一的面積。　　我參觀那天的節目單上，福斯公司有五張片子在攝製，「凱斯蒂船長」全部人馬在墨西哥拍攝外景，不在好萊塢。其餘四張：「琥珀永存」，由「胭脂淚」「英雄美人」的主角林達黛妮兒，和「一曲難忘」的主角康納徵爾德合演的，另一張「野薔薇」，潘琪兄明主演的；那天都臨時改期。我看了一塲室內攝影「三十四號街奇事」，約翰潘恩主演的，在一間精美的臥室內，佈影非常小，水銀燈祇照着那一角，整個健身房都鴉雀無聲，祇聽見男女演員的對白。　　另外一張是室外攝影：「摩兒太太見鬼」，是「胭脂血」的主角喬治山德和琪恩泰妮合演的，佈景是一家小市鎭的雜貨店門口兩個導演曼克威洽和　司頓（助理導演）都在那兒。琪恩泰妮穿一件皮大衣，滿不在乎的抽着烟捲。　　約翰福耳說：二十世紀福斯公司，全年拍製影片的資本，大約是三千萬元。我間他影片的收入？他說：祗有老闆知道。　　老闆是誰？達萊，碩納克。　　沒有一個福斯公司的職員，不敬佩碩納克的才能與遠見，這一位貧寒出身，曾經在加利福尼亞當過『碼頭工人』的電影界名人，是自我奮鬥的一個典型的英雄畫像。他做任何一件事，從來不呌苦，從來不灰心，而且永遠帶着一顆愉快的進取的心。好萊塢許多人說他年靑，（其實也不太年輕），說他幼稚。他的回答很乾脆：『二十世紀福斯公司之所以有今天，就憑這一份年靑的朝氣幹出來的』！　　碩納克今年四十五歲，珍珠港事變以後，他的年靑稚氣，促使他『從軍』，他參加北非登陸，軍隊生活，增加了他電影的材料，同時，也使他增加了電影與社會的新體騐。　　碩納克是美國奈布拉斯加州人，父親在一座呌做『華和』的小城市裏，經營一家小客棧。幼年時代，他隨父親旅行到加利福尼亞，在那兒，他知道了電影事業，他一個人偸偸的跑進電影廠去，被父親抓回來。第一次歐洲大戰的時候，他繞祗十八歲，他從軍參加陸軍第三十七師。　　他的寫作天才，使他在軍隊中編『星條旗報』，但是不久，戰爭結束，他退伍了，回到美國，因爲失業和飢餓，他在加利福尼亞的輪船碼頭上當力伕，憑着節省，他積了一點錢。　　碩納克然後組織一片小規模的廣告公司，他繼續努力於他的電影寫作，但是很多次都失敗了，原因是：他那時不懂得電影。他向別人請敎，學習，最後，舊福斯公司用了他的劇本，第一次，收到了五百元一張支票的稿費。　　一年以後，碩納克初有了一點寫作的小名現。華納公司聘請了他，給他一百五十塊錢一星期的薪水，因爲工作成績好，他又升了助理『製片者』。　　重要的一個關鍵，使碩納克能够成功，那是一九二八年的『有聲電影』的產生。那一年，片上發普，證明已經可能做到，但還沒有絕對把握。華納公司的總經理華納傑克，想拍攝一部默片加上歌唱的影片，片名呌做『爵士音樂家』，跟由國第一張有聲片『歌女紅牡丹』同一道理。華納傑克找碩納克商量，碩納克非常反對，他說：『不幹則已，要幹，來全部有聲對白片』！　　那時候，誰都不相信『有聲片』是那末容易，和現在美國人看『電傳術』一樣，都相當神秘和新鮮。但是，華納傑克授全權給碩納克，碩納克終於成功了。　　一九三一年，碩納克成了華納公司的『製片長』，總經理以下的最重要的執行者，他利用報紙，無綫電，大量的運用他的宣傳才能華納公司的影片廣吿，在全美國各地報紙的封面上見到。　　兩年以後，碩納克退出了華納公司，和約　夫施乃克，合創了二十世紀福斯公司，那是一九三三年的事，『靑出於藍』，二十世紀福斯公司的規模，現在似乎走在華納公司的前面了。　　二十世紀福斯公司的第一張片子是傑克古柏的『街頭巷尾』。十四年來，福斯公司的名片風行全世界。碩納克自己，常常旅行海外，在歐洲，在南美，他被許多人熱烈歡迎着，他接受過法國的文藝獎章，戰爭期間，他是聯邦政府的國防顧問。一九四二年碩納克從軍，在軍隊中當上校，十八個月以後，他又回到美國，他在華盛頓紐約洛杉磯演講，總提到『抗日』的影片太少，而『反納猝』的較多。那一年，他拍製了『黑龍會陰謀』，描寫美國被俘飛行壯士的慘苦，但是片子拍成了，美國政府禁止公映，原因是，刺激日本，深怕日本更虐待美國俘虜。碩納克那時相當着急，他說：『我投資了二百萬哪，這怎麽得了』！　　『黑龍會陰謀』是他自導的傑作，此後，他又導演了一張更成功的片子！"The　RaZor's　Edge"，這張片子在紐約露克賽戲院上演，前前後後，有一百萬以上的觀衆。　　二十世紀福斯公司的蕊礎，已經牢不可拔，碩納克現在不僅是美國電影事業的合柱，而且也是美國社會的一個中堅，他現在提出一句口號：以電影事業增進人類之間的瞭解，爭取世界的和平。　　他說：『如果我們拿這個爲職志，爲目標，那我們今天的規模還不够，還差得很遠』！　　碩納克的瘦長結實的身材，常常在廠裏的各地方出現。每次片子攝成以後的第一次預映，頭納克必定帶着他那漂亮的夫人，坐在中間，他夫人是不輕易露面的，廠裏很多人都從未見過她！　　碩納克是二十世紀福斯公司的副董事長兼總經理，是公司全部計劃執行的『獨裁者』。董事長是斯可拉斯，一位老先生，常常住在紐約，很少到好萊塢來。福斯公司主人碩納約（Zanuck），與導演曼克威治（Mankiewicz）會商攝製工作。（本報特派員毛樹淸奇）　　（上）福斯公司立體佈景一例：木板釘成的假洋房（下）福斯公司辦公室（本報特派負毛樹淸寄）　　（上）中國鄉村，大觀園一景。（下）大觀園內的運河與帆船（本報特派員毛樹淸寄）開導國內學術風氣　福建省研究院　配合本省建設工作  福州廿八日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予　　抗戰時期，沿海各學術文化機關相繼內遷，東南學術頓形偏枯，閩省府乃羅致彼時留處東南之碩彥學者籌設省硏究院，於廿九年一月正式成立，聘請聖聲國內外之名物理學者薩本棟博士任首任院長。閩省硏究院之設立，在各省中尙屬創舉　　從抗戰到勝利，數年來之歲月，幾經變遷，該院乃逐漸擴充而規模漸具。現任院長周昌萊博一，近應邀出長農林部當次，據云周氏仍以學術爲重，將軍返福建主持院務。　　作業　劃分　　該院硏究之目標，以純理與應用並重，應用方面注重雀內特殊切要問題之硏究，期與省內政治經濟文化雖設密切配合。硏究工作之進行，力求與國內外各學術文化機關取得密切聯繫，以收相互切磋交換之效。其研究部門分爲五部：（一）社會科學硏究所，（二）動植物硏究所，（三）農林硏究所，（四）工業硏究所，（五）水土保持實騐區。其中水土保持實騐區之設立，乃研究如何防止土壤沖刷與侵蝕問題，旣不屬於農林範圍、亦不隸於化學肥料之類，其作業在我國尙屬初創。另設評議會，作爲該院最髙學術審議機關，確定硏究方針與論文之發表。　　設備　一斑　　該院於勝利後由永安遷回福州，省府指撥倉前山德國駐榕領事館及德商謙信洋行全部敵產作爲院址。除各部門辦公室外，動植物研究所附設有植物園一方佔地約廿畝，另溫室一座，動物飼養舍二座。農林硏究所租用水田廿五畝，旱地廿畝，作爲實騐之用。工業硏究所附設化工實騐室，機械工塲各一所，動物園在計劃設置中。　　中西文圖書約有二萬册，其中三分之二屬於自然科學方面，三分之一屬於社會科學，此外，有國內外報章什誌百餘種。儀器方面如髙倍顯微鏡，萬份之一精細天秤，分光儀，經緯儀，放射性物質測定儀，農具，工價母機等，各種設備堪稱差強人意。　　研究　課題　　關於農業經濟之硏究：福建仍爲典型之農業地帶，若干地區會因歷史上實行激劇之土地改革，遺有土地改革之痕跡。惟未有澈底之解決，所以，傳統的半封建的生產形態仍然存在，社會生產力無從提髙，該院劉子松氏著有「羅馬尼亞土地政策」一文，含有借鏡之意。此外，章振乾氏之「租佃制度原論」一文亦具有價値。福建土地問題以閩西爲最具特色，如龍岩，上杭，永定等縣土地，歷經共黨沒收分配，十九路軍計口授田，綏靖時期二五减租，以及近年來扶植自耕農諸般鼎革，式樣雖迭經婦演，其特點與跡象仍可窺察，該院正硏究各種土地改革型式問題之取捨，次如閩省地近亞熱帶，外人曾稱之爲「寄生虫之眞正倉庫」，境內繁殖着各種原虫與蠕虫，造成特有之各種熱帶病，瘧疾即爲閩省公共衛生上一個嚴重問題，該院正針對此點作學術上之探討。閩雀山嶺疊嶂，谿堅幽險，且港灝曲折，受南海　流之感應，水陸動物種類繁多，加以純理之硏究，不特於地方富源之開發，饒有意義，即於分類學分布學上亦具價値。該院陳子英博士所著之「長汀虎骨膠硏究」，黄震之「福建省淡永魚類誌」及尊兆鑾之「鯊魚肝提鍊魚肝油之硏究」等文皆屬上選之著述。他如對於閩省特產之硏究，製紙與揉捻毛茶技術之改良，以松根提鍊汽油解決閩省液體燃料缺乏之需要，皆根據科學原理提出硏究意見，以供當局採納。至於該院對於閩省森林之調査，尤多新奇而有價値之發現，如長道鐵杉，金錢松等原始森林，皆從未爲前人所發現者，該院劉業經氏之「福建枕木之調査」一文尤爲福建森林開一新出路。法國友人協助實施　四川工業化  成都六月廿五日航訊　本報駐蓉記者周學端　　六月是成都最鮮明爽朗的季節，月初從上海來了一位受人歡迎的國際佳賓，——法銀行團代表沙班先生，爲貸款協助完成四川工業化計劃，特來蓉與省市政府洽商，並作實地考察，進一步在技術上協助改進，經過數度考察硏究，獲得了圓滿的具體結果。在沙班先生準備帶了四川人殷望下的貸款計劃與協助技術辦法，返上海籌劃貸款前夕，記者和他談到新四川工業化的建設問題。　　建設四川　法國甚願樂助　　沙班先生是中國的忠實友人，他認爲中法兩國在戰時比肩作戰，處境相同，艱危　共，有極可貴的患難友情。戰後中法兩國共同目標在建設世界的和平安定，應該互助互勉，共謀復興。他說：他是四川的愛好者，四川在今日是中國建設模範省，法國尤願多所協助，渠以故友資格萬地重來，更願以最興奮情緒，各方面供獻力量，樂觀四川建設使命的完成。　　鐵路貸款　法國首先簽字　　沙班先生最關心的四川建設，首先是成渝鐵路，而成渝路的法國貸款，也是他始終主持其事。據說：成渝路法貸款事，法國方面渠已簽字，中國方面由交通部兪部長代表，俟行政院核准後即可簽字。貸款總額一千六百萬美金，合一億餘兆佛郞，年利率百分之五，簽字後即可撥付。其次沙班先生認爲四川二大特產——自貢之　與內江之糖——同是最有前途的新工業，法國方面甚願在技術上盡力協助並貸放改進生產資金。據稱：關於川糖與川鹽生產技術改進問題，渠已與專家多人數度硏究，將待彼轉赴自內實地考察後，再作最後決定。　　美化成都　完成四大工程　　成都是沙氏舊遊之地，法國很多人知道成都號構「東方小巴黎」，所以沙班先生對於成都有更深的親切愛好。他這次來蓉目的，即是抱了最大願望來協助建設新成都，經與市政當局旬日懇商，決定貸款協助四大建設；第一，發展交通。除成渝鐵路外，並建築成灈鐵路（或長途無軌電車），由法銀行團貸款購器材，並負責工程。第二，成都市無軌電車，法銀行團決投資六十億元興修，並準備與上海法商電軍公司合作協助工程技術。第三，電化事業，擴充蓉市現有的啓明電燈公司，在成渝路貸款器材內，轉撥五千兛電機及大部材料。第四，環境衛生，完成成都自來水公司全部工程，約貸款五六百億元。　　沙班先生認爲中國最有前途，四川工業化建設極可樂觀，以中法傅統友誼關係，法國協助中國完成模範省的建設，最感榮幸。記者從沙班先生誠摯的語調中，體味到國際友誼的忠誠與可貴。重修南潯綫（上）路工搬運鋼軌（下）釘道情形（本報記者劉蒞攝寄）江西鑛產窺探  鄱陽六月廿六日快訊　本報特約記者愈寧頗　　銀黄黑白晶亮亮的鑛物，很不自傲地說是現代人文一切動態的原動；十九世紀乃至今日的燦爛，無非是由鑛物所燃燒煆煉配合而成，多少國際鬥爭，爲了奪取鑛產開採權；若干萬萬的生靈，直接間接依鑛爲命；祇有中國各種鑛物，却有許多老是聽它長眠地下，常有不得見天日的悲哀！　　記者特就贛省現有的鑛藏，作一個窺探性的報導一些在下面：　　江西鑛產，向來是很著名，儲量尤其豐富；，就中要敦煤·鎢·鐵三鑛的藏量爲最多，其他金·銀·銅·錫·鋁·銻·磁土等，分佈亦很廣。此外更有世界著名的特產鑛物如鋅·錳·　·等尤爲贛省　實藏。　　贛省府爲謀開發本省各種特產。對各縣鑛類，深切注意。經先後派員分往各產區實均調査，結果，金屬鑛已發現的，有　·錫·鉍·鉑·金·銀·銅·鐵·鋁·錳·　·十一艦。　　蘊藏最富　樂煤鑛　　本省煤　，西自萍鄉經新喩·吉安·鹽城·樂平·以至上饒·廣鹽。横峯。横貫全省中部，爲一絕大煤田。此外北部的九江·瑞昌·南部的信鹽·興國·無不產煤。　　據中央地質調査所發行的「中國鑛業紀要」所推測的，約計江西全省煤鑛的儲量爲九八九兆噸，佔全國第七位。再以宜靑·萬載·武寧·上饒·玉山·新喩·髙安·和贛南各縣加入統計，儲藏最約在三千五百兆噸。其中產量最富的，要推萍鄉的安源煤鑛，每月可出洗塊煤三千餘噸，含固定炭百分之六九·四二，爲煉焦和其他燃料的用。產洗粉煤二萬餘噸，含固定炭百分之六二·六五，產機焦煤二千餘噸，含圃定炭百分之八二·六四，專供冶金用。次推樂平鳴山的鄱樂煤鑛，每月可出煤四千八百噸，能用以提煉煤油汽油，每噸含油量百分之五十三。再次爲吉安天河煤鑛，年產量一萬餘噸。　　特產鎢錳世界稀有　　鎢·錳·這兩種稀有的鑛物，是江西特產鑛物，也可說是中國的特產鑛物。分佈於贛南會昌·大庾·安遠·贛縣·南康·蓮花·泰和·興國·上猶·雲都·各縣，在民國初年就佔了世界產額十分之三，到民國十八年佔全世界產額十分之五。其中以會是·大庾·安德·產量篇最多。大庾　鑛，在　華售·漢水　·九龍腦等處，年產量約二萬担，品質最佳，會純錫百分之七二三四。上猶錦鑛在下淸，年產三千担。均運遞港轉銷歐美各國，供獲造鎢鋰之用。抗戰開始二三年中，香港去路最大。　　錳僅戰北樂平　峯一處的獨產，儲量很製，年產約二萬担，含純錳成分百分之　一·三九·運滬轉銷國外，爲　鍋及染料和乾電池原料之用。　　東方特產磁土軟泥　　瓷土·是一種籟物質，和石灰·大理石，樣子相彷彿，狀是片　有灰白兩種顏色，專爲造瓷原料外，並可代替肥皂滌垢，和製粉筆的用。歐西及我國廣東·廣西·湖南·河南·福建·浙江·等省雖亦產生瓷土，其鑛質之適用，都不及祁門贛產之優良。　　景德鎭製磁所用的瓷士，一部份細瓷釉泥，取自安徽的祁門。其餘的多產於本縣浮梁和星子·餘干·臨川·大庾·　峯·宣鹽·太和·萍鄉等縣，土質以浮梁所產爲最優，土質性軟，色帶灰褐，黑云母之含量極多，亦間有少許的白云母，惟粘力較祁門瓷土稍弱，耐火度，爲三角錐熟度計十四號，約攝氏一千四百十度。其他萍鄉·泰和績峯所產的瓷土，質比浮產粗劣，祗可製粗瓷之用。　　其他錫鐵銅金鉑鉍　　錫和鎢共生，贛南大庾·上猶·　都·贛縣·南康·崇義·產鎢的處均產之，年景約一千餘噸，大庾錫鑛產九體　·洪永寨·西華山·潔塘等處。全年產錫砂一萬餘担，含錫或分百分之六十以上。零都鋁鑛產上坪·年產一百七十五担，上猶錫鑛產中梢寺，年產六百担。　　江西鐵續的發現地很多，產量以九江·永新·蓮花·萍鄉·等縣為晨豐。其中最有名的，就是九江城門山·萍鄉山株熱，瑞昌陳家同，三處的赤鐵鑛，年產生鐵和鐵砂約三千餘噸。城門山鐵鑛，質極優良，含鐵成分百分之六十。　　贛東弋陽縣上陽王埠方，發現鑛一產，蓄量頗豐。同邑五十保鐵石地方，有大銅鎭一座，質甚佳。曾由該縣長張搶元呈請省府派員査勘，籌備開採。　　鈷銘，都與鎢共生的，鉑之用途，可製鉑鋼，試藥原料防腐劑，防火劑滅火劑，效力甚宏但產量甚少鄉年產只百餘噸，可製造易溶性合金，電流節制器，印刷活字，鍋爐保險塞，藥劑，顏料，染料諸原料，用途很廣。香港　物價管制　　國內物價，飛一般的上漲。而香港的物價，却不斷的下跌……就一般情勢觀察，今後還是看跌。豐，西貢暹羅米又源源而來，同時每禁米出口，米價看跌，正是自然的趨勢。　　米價是一切日用必需品的指針，米價旣然大跌，其他魚肉蔬菜，也無一不跌，港政府每星期有生活指數公佈，指數的下降，使得薪資階級份子，感到了一陣輕鬆。　　爲什麽香港物價會和國內背道而馳呢？最大的原因是港政府管制　　物價政策　　初步的成功。港政府對於食糧·肉·香烟·鮮菓·成藥·衣服等都規定公價，商店必須將公價表陳列在商店內顯著的地方，凡公價物品，價格均須標明淸楚，如果任意抬髙售價，輕則罰鍰，重則封閉。　　爲了要消滅黑市，港政府派了許多密探到各商店偵査，最初每天報上總有一大批商店被罰，後來商人曉得政府的法令，不是具文，也就不敢輕於嘗試了。　　港政府爲了貫澈公價，自已經常　有大批物資，在黑市商人抬髙價格的時候，他們便大量拋出，使物價不抑自平，過去絨綫每磅售價六十多元　　一個從上海或廣州來到香港的朋友，對於這種矛盾的現象，一定會感到意外的驚奇。似乎是英國人故意對中國經濟現狀的一個尖銳諷刺。　　香港的米在半年前每担平均是一百二十元，現在呢，絲苗米僅賣到六十五元，西貢粘五十七元，差不多已跌了一半。這幾天因爲粤省大水，米價曾一度波動，但經過港政府嚴密査究以後，又迅速回降。港政府存米極，政府規定公價爲十五元，商人最初囤貨不賣，政府便委托各大公司按公價儘量拋售，結果囤戶逼得賤價脫手，不久，市價竟跌到十五元以下，比公價更低了。　　政府規定公價的標準，是按成本再加百分之十　　合法利潤　　計算的。以絨綫而論，成本最多不過十四元，市價竟售六十多元，商人的利潤，是何等驚人，政府爲保障人民，不惜以種種方法來和商人鬥爭，這種措施，是十分値得稱頌的。　　香港物價趨跌的第二個原因，是國幣貶値，照最近的匪率伸算，港紙二元已値國幣八千元了。香港的日用必需品如米麵蔬菜，是從廣東各地運來的，在港幣上漲率比物價上漲率更快的時候，就港幣而言，物價自然是下跌的。反之，外洋進口的貨物，多以國內爲市塲，香港本身的消胃極小，國幣愈跌，國內的購實力愈弱，香港的貨價，也非下跌不可。　　就一般的趨勢觀察，香港今後的物價，依然看跌，人民生活，或可日趨安定。　　香港六月廿六日航訊　本報特約記者程志政</p>

<p>春秋鐵匠  E·左拉著　畢修勺譯　　鐵匠是個大個子，當地最大的大個子，兩肩結實，臉與胳臂，因鐵爐的火燄與鐵鎚的鐵灰而黝黑。在他方的腦蓋與濃密的厚髮之下，有着大而綠的孩子眼睛跟鋼鐵一樣的閃閃發光。他的寬的顎骨轉出笑聲與打鼾的氣息，簡直如他鳳箱的巨人呼吸與歡樂一樣；他雖已五十歲當他以滿意的有力姿態，—這姿態是他平常打鐵時所獲得的習慣—舉起他的胳臂時，他好像比靑年還要有勁地使用他的「小姐」，一個二十五斤重的鐵鎚，他一人能從凡爾農舞動到童昻的可怕工具。　　我在鐵匠家裏，足足住了一年，養病的一年。　　我的心煩躁，我的頭腦昏亂，我出門，向着我的前面走去，我尋找自己，我尋找一個平和與工作的角落，使我能恢復我的壯捷。一天下午，當我越過村莊之後我就這樣瞥見一個打鐵店，孤立地，滿屋紅光地橫在四路的交叉上。火光那樣輝耀，致我從大開着的通車之門，射到外面，使十字路口映着火災一般的赤色，並使對面沿着小河排着的白楊樹，如火炬似的發出耀眼的光亮。遠處，在柔和的暮色之中，有節奏的鎚聲響到數里以外，像是漸漸近來的鐵軍在曠野間奔跑一樣。那裏，在大開着的門下，在鐵爐的光明與這雷也似的震動與喧閙中，我停着，看這工作，注視這些人手在綾曲與寧平赤紅的鐵杆，我已覺得很幸福，精神上也已得到莫大的安慰了。　　秋天的這一晚，我第一次看見鐵匠，他在鍜冶犁顯。襯衫開着，露出粗的胸口他的兩脇，於每次呼吸的時候，顯露鐵也似的筋骨，他向後仰着裝起突擊的姿勢，打下他的鐵鎚。這樣，毫不間斷地以身體的柔軟微動和筋肉的堅靱推撞，繼續着他的工作。鐵鑓在一個合規的圓周裏轉動，帶去許多火花，並把一種閃光留在牠的後面。鐵匠用兩手在舞動的，就是「小姐」　至於他的兒子，一個二十歲的活潑青年，則用火鉗鉗着燃燒的紅鐵，也用他的鐵鎚打在鐵上，發出鈍重的聲音，終於敵不過老頭子的可怕「小姐」的響亮舞蹈。多克，多克，—多克，多克，人們以為是一個母親的嚴肅聲音在鼓勵孩子的最初學話呢。「小姐」仍在作「瓦爾次」舞，搖動她舞衣上的發光鐵石，讓她的後跟，印在紅的犁頭上，她每次重跳在鐵碪之上，就使她脚下的鐵質改變樣式·一種血樣的火燄一直流到地上，照耀兩個工人的突露面骨，他們的互大影子一直伸展在鍜鐵房的陰暗的與糢糊的角上。漸漸紅光消退了，鐵匠也停止了。他黝黑地站着，靠在鐵鎚的柄上，前額流着汗，他並不揩拭牠。我在他兒子用手慢慢抽動的風箱的吼聲中，聽見他還在搖動的胸部的呼吸。夜衷，我睡在鐵匠家裏，我不再離開這裏了。我在樓上鍜鐵房的上面，有一間空的，由他供給我的而我也高興接受的房間。從早晨，天還沒有放光的五點鐘起，我就參與我主人的工作。我由全屋的響聲驚醒，這歡笑也似的快樂響聲，一直活動到夜裏。我的下面，鐵鎚在跳舞。「小姐」連續地，敲着我脚下的天花板，好像喊我起來，把我看作一個懶惰者。整個的可憐房間，牠的大衣橱，牠的白木桌，牠的兩把椅子，都戞戞她饗着，好像催我趕快穿衣。我必須下去。到下面，我看見鍜鐵房已經紅了。風箱轟轟地響着，藍的與玫瑰色的火　從煤炭中升起，星球的圓體在捲擱炭火的風下發光。然而，鐵匠準備他一日的工作。他搬動角落裏的生　，圍繞耕犁，檢查輪盤。待看見我的時候，他即把雨拳放在腰間，這可敬的人，他笑，他的嘴一直裂到耳朶。五點鐘，把我從床上趕起來，這似乎使他快活。他相信他是為敲擊而敲擊，早晨只以他的鐵鎚的可怕的合奏，催醒大家。他把他的巨手放在我的肩上，他俯了身來，如對一個孩子說話似的對我說，從我活在他的爛鐵中間之後，我的身體已比較康健了。每日，我們在一輛翻倒的舊車尾部，一起喝着白的葡萄酒。　　接着，我住在鍛鐵房襄，度過我的一日。尤其是冬天下雨的時候，我全日的鐘點都生活在那裏。我對於鍛鐵的工作發生興趣。鐵匠連續地敲這他所任意揉改的生鐵的鬥爭，終於如一齣有力的悲劇一樣，使我激動。我看着從火爐到鐵碪的金屬，我看牠在工人的勝利的努力之下，如軟臘一樣的購曲，伸展與捲動，不免感　這纖的驚奇。當耕犁裝好的時候，我跪在他的前面，我已不記載前夕的不成形的粗樣，我審察零件。我夢想，我以為是無上強大的手指就這樣　妙地鑄造牠，並不要火的協助。有時，我徽笑，我想瀉從前我曾看見的一個少女，在我窗口的對面，以她　弱的兩手，絞動黃鋼絲，用一根絲綫，把人造的紫羅蘭，紮在這些銅絲的上面。　　鐵匠從來不歎息。我曾看見他，白天打了十四小時的鐵之後，夜間很高興地笑着，以滿意的態度擦洗他的臂胳。他從來不憂悶，從來不疲乏。他可以用他的肩膀支住他的房屋，如他的房屋要坍了來的話。冬天，他說他的鍛鐵房裏很暖和。夏天他讓門大開着，使乾草的氣味可以進來。當夏天到來，太陽將要下山的時候，我到門前，坐在他的身邊。我們是在半山腰上；我們從那裏可以看見山谷的寬廣面積。他默察這無限大的，綠氈一般的耕地，消失於薄暮淡紫色的地平綫中，覺得非常幸福。　　鐵匠時常說笑。他說這一切土地都是屬於他的，他的鍛鐵房，從兩百多年以來，就對附近的整個區域，供給耕犁。這是他的倨傲。如果沒有他，就沒有豐盛的收穫物。平原到五月所以是靑的，到七月所以是黃的，牠所以有這絲絨一般變化的景象，完全是他的功勞。他愛田野的耕作物，如愛他自己的女兒一樣，太陽好的時候，他高興，下雹的時候，他舉起拳來反對天邊的黑雲。往往，他向我指出，遠遠的好像沒有衣背那麽大的一塊土地，他對我敍述他在某一年，曾為方塊的薔麥田或大麥田，造過一具耕犁。遇到耕種的節季，他有時拋開他的鐵鎚，他到路的邊簶，手放在腿上，他注視前面的出畝。他注視許多由他一家出去的耕犁，深入土地，在對面的左邊或右邊，翻出牠們的犁痕。山谷中充滿了他的產物。要見耕馬慢慢地在前進，簡直可以說，是許多軍隊在行走呢。犁頭以銀樣的反光，閃爍於太陽之下。他，舉起胳臂，他喊我，他要我來看牠們所做的是多麽「神聖的事業」　　這一切在我脚下發聲的燦爛的鐵器，使我的血裏也充滿鋼鐵。這比藥房裏的任何藥品，都有價値。我習慣於這騷擾的聲音，我需要這鐵鎚打在鐵碪上的音樂，使我聽到我自己的生命。在我的整個由風箱吼聲激動的房間裏我已重新找到我的可憐的頭腦。多克，多克，—多克，多克，這簡直是規定我工作時間的快樂的鐘擺。工作最緊張，鐵匠發氣，我聽見紅鐵在附着魔鬼似的鐵鎚之下戞戞作響的時候，我的手掌中有着巨人一般的熱度，我想用我的筆頭壓平整個的世界。接着，當鍜鐵房不響的時候，我的腦蓋中也是整個的沉靜；我下去，看見這被征服的，還在發烟的金屬，我就感到我的工作的可恥。　　啊！有時，在天熱的下午，我看見鐵匠是多麽雄偉！他一直裸到腰身，突露與緊張的筋肉，如米開朗琪羅的一個巨像一樣，表現着無上的力量。注視他的時候，我發現到近代的雕刻綫，這是我們的藝術家在希臘的死肉中所費力地尋找的。在我看來，他好像是勞動的偉大英雄，這一世紀的不倦子孫，他不斷地在鐵碪上鍜造我們的分析工具，並用鐵與火，創建我們的未來社會。他，以鐵鎚，作他的玩具。當他要笑的時候，他拿起他的「小姐」並很快地擊着鐵碪。於是他使他的全家，在火爐的玫瑰色的喘息中，充滿雷也似的聲音。我以為聽見勞苦民衆的呻吟。　　就是在那裏，在放滿耕犁的鍛鐵房中，我永遠治愈了我的懶病與懷疑。　　左拉的社會正義　　一提起法蘭西的寫實主義，人們就只會想起福樓拜，莫泊桑，實則左拉纔是這方面的主宰，左拉的方法，是十九世紀法蘭西寫實主義最特異的，也是最激底的方法。他以深邃的觀察力，捉住了一切社會觀象，浪漫主義者描寫英雄美人之餘，稍稍觸到小布爾喬及下層階級，左拉則用最大的精力來描寫他們。他曾經為了要找到他所要描寫的，不惜深入下層社會，不惜替妓女寫傳記，他要為一切被壓迫着的靈魂控訴。　　當有名的德萊福事件發生，左拉為社會正義而被激怒了，他不惜任何犧牲起來斜彈。　　事實經過是這樣的：猶本人德萊福斯，因為在戰爭中被誣為洩漏軍機而遭逮捕入獄。可是實際上他是無罪的。眞的犯人到後來也被查覺出來了。然而一般懷有種族偏見的法國人和軍國主義者，仍然不肯取消德萊福斯的裁判，而且竟然處以流刑。左拉不能忍受這種非正義的行為，便在報紙上，發表了有名的「我控訴」的公開狀，以彈劾軍事當局的不法行為，同時印發了許多小册子，以喚起全國與論界的注意。法國的興論界也確因此騷動了，支特左拉的人，有文豪法朗士，米爾波，克列曼梭，以及後來因反對歐洲大戰被暗殺的約翰，若列斯等。另一派却加諸左拉以界名，駡左拉為賣國賊，並且訴之以誣告罪。　　左拉就在一八九八年二月十二日，竟不得不受法庭的裁判。左拉到了法庭，仍忿然地願以生命和名譽來担保德來福斯的無罪。　　然而毫無正義的法庭，終於對左拉宣布了一年的監禁，和三千佛朗的罰款。使左拉不得不出走英國，過了一年的逃亡生活。　　左拉是無情的在暴露社會的黑暗，在反抗一切非正義的行為。現在我們要研究一下、左拉的暴露黑暗面的種種相，是以怎樣的立塲為他自己的立塲呢。我們由上述這個事實來看。他是一個社會正義之士，他不惜與眾國主義的專制政治鬥爭，雖然身受輿論的指摘受法律的裁判，但他滿腔的憎怒却一直向着那惡辣的榨取者發洩。可是，這畢竟只是一片正義之感，他的立傷也只止於此而已。　　他說：『……如果這樣下去，不免導法蘭西於滅亡，如要改良社會，必須從家族改良起』。從這些話裏，該可以看出左拉的眞相了。　　在目前，單就是這種社會正義，我們也還是需要的，但望我們的作家們，也能像左拉似的發抒正義。伸張正義。紫藤子規  凌虛鄉居小品  高鸞　　夜梟　　第一夜在那麽一座四周皆是湛碧的溪流的小村子裏睡覺，幻想使我感到無邊的恐怖與戰慄。夜，漆黑黑地，大地似乎死去了不知多少年代。我蜷伏在眠床上，深深地悔恨自己，不該吹滅了那盞映着黃色的微光的菜油燈，不該不仔細將茅舍的竹門拴住。平素我本不信那些虛無的水妖木魅一類的東西要攫人，可是到這「鄕村五月闖無人」的時候，像火綫上敗退下來的殘兵，獵戶緊緊地追趕着糜鹿，胆怯就牢牢地一似長春籐之纏繞古柏。夜梟的慘號，魚響的喋唼，使我再沒有一點或半點力量來拒抗牠的脅威。　　也許這是一種變態心理，不過那水鄕的深夜，那批居停在溪畔大樟樹上的夜梟，通常總要尖厲地發出像絞犯臨刑時的悲嗥。鄕間迷信色彩特別濃厚，祗要稍一聯想，陰森森的鬼魂，就彷彿眞的存在於人間。並不是相信「鬼」，實在呢，夜梟的號聲委實凄厲了一點……　　槍聲　　月光下，同那些天眞誠樸的農夫談談天是怪有味的。一個傍晚，我們正在「講笑話」忽然從一畦閣閣的蛙聲中，滲進了那傢伙的聲音。說起那「傢伙」人人要提心吊胆。近來四鄉不寗，從遠處飄來的微風中，常常可以聽到那種隱隱約約的槍聲。農夫們沒有發抒感慨的才能，沉默便是他們唯一的方法。我看着天際那一彎下弦月勾在藍色的背景上，心內也難免有點忐忑。過了一會，犬吠要夾雜了喧嚷的話聲，哭聲，遠遠近近的水田裏返射出閃爍的夜光，我懂得了農民的「血」與「淚」。老魏說：「盜能原是農民之無法生存者」·一次的搶刧，一次的增加，溫柔的水鄉眞怕變成强盜的世界。　　晨霧　　早晨有大霧，遙望對岸的山水草木，都　糢糊糊地好像有什麽全能者替牠們披上了一襲輕巧的鮫綃。這裏的霧朝是很媚人，四山都沒在白茫茫的一片裏，牛羊村舍，在隱約之中使人疑心這是童話裏的境界中。英在溪邊濃蔭下浣衣，我站在她的旁邊，對着這樣的霧裏溪山，不由不馳騁起我追憶往昔的駿馬：往事如霧一般迷濛了我底雙眼，那兒有我底哀慾，我底歡樂。過去的岡畫的色彩，是複雜的。那裏染滿了我無限的「生之顏色」。我有愛和恨，笑和淚。生活的霧，霧的生活，但從沒有像水鄕的霧景似地美麗過。英大槪也為這「霧」所激動，她迴眸對我一笑！　　別再獃在風霧中啦，一回兒陽光出來了，景色固然沒有現在的迷人；可是，牠到底比較光明，像樣，正式。老樹  宣建人　　老樹，烏雀們甜蜜的家。　　我不知道它的出生的年月日，也不曉得它潸磨幾多春，夏，秋，冬。但它的驅幹，給我以老的感覺；當我推開窗門遠眺，它的靑翠的葉子，給我一種美感。當風脚來時，它給我信號，無論淸晨或夜晚。　　太陽剛出山，金鶯鳥的幽美的曲子，輕叩着我的夢門。我翻了一個身，疲倦仍糾纏着我，不想爬起來。聽，聽這優美的曲子。喜鵲不甘示弱，也打開嗓門唱歌，像在競爭冠軍。這只有那麻雀拙劣的歌手，吵得使人難受；這支交響曲，多麽不和諧、然而是靑春的。　　老樹的枝幹上，鳥雀們築了許多窩巢，點綴它的美麗。　　老樹，它像一把綠傘，撐向陽光。一寸山河一寸血　332  葉勁風　　　　W君為這件事十分焦灼，請我和鶴見，上樓密議。這是四日下午的事。其時，鶴見似乎方寸己亂，因這三件不如意的事，都與他有切身關係。同時，他當晚就得動身；松井替他安排了兩條路綫返國；一，走天津乘軍部運輸艦，二十四小時可達東京；二，搭軍用機到潘陽，轉釜山，飛東京，時間較短。　　我們幾個人，商討了一小時，最後決定由我出塲，唱這　大軸子；先到天津，用「十五號」方式，到日方行軍總部活動。同時由W君佈置，呌津地反諜組織中，未遭毒手的人，設法同我發生聯繫，冒險營救　羣和受拘的同志們。　　鶴見因須到潘陽有些佈置，決定採用松井替他佈置的第二條路程。臨別，他緊緊握住我的手：　　一岳大哥，總部移植山西的事，等我到東京來信，再定行止。無論如何，總部的事，是要拜託老大哥的了！……天津方面，耀羣和小老虎的事，還有這方面同志的事，也一總要拜託老大哥了！……還有這邊的事，（指北平W君總部），最近也許不會有大麻煩；萬一有麻煩，也得老大哥煩心，『帮撑』一二；這也是得拜託老大哥的了！」　　這裏一共三個「拜託」；頭兩件拜託，總算在我名分之下，就算不拜託，我旣祖起了這個使命，也得盡力而為。但這第三項拜託，却是哪一檔案的事呢？「帮撑」兩個字，因他所學國語，到底不算透澈，也許是「帮助」的誤用；然而却如何也拜託給我？W君的腦筋和手腕，不知要比較我高明幾十百倍。我算老幾？何須也「拜託」給我？　　最後，他又把握住我的那隻手，加上了幾分力量，狠狠搖了幾下：「我這一次到東京，『生死未卜』，萍子的事，不曉得究竟是什麽一套魔術，我也猜想不出，只好儘命去碰。碰得好，當然都好；萍子是一把好手，應當儘量利用。萬一碰得不好，我們這十二個秘密站的事，也得拜託老大哥了！」他說到這裏，把頭漸漸低下去了。　　他這四項「拜託」，大有「囑咐後事」的意味。我一面勉强應承，一面也感到十分愫惶。　　拜託我之後，他對W君，照樣來了四項拜託，只那第三項，改了一個說法。二十幾歲的人，一直胸襟蕭晒，這時竟如此婆婆媽媽起來。鶴見此時心下的况味，可想而知，好像陡失依據，不禁有些悲愴怳忽了。　　鶴見走後，我和W君把剛才計議過的節目，重又檢討一番，因事關重大，不得不如此審愼。在檢討之下，我們把「十五號一方式，仔細斟酌一番，要看是否能圓滑應用；有無後患。　　什麽呌做「十五號」？這並非鶴見和我的新發明。普通國際最高級情報外勤，都有這種方式的運用。不過把這些方式機械化，列成號碼，却是鶴見的創作；有說不盡的便利。（最高特別外勤，即國際間諜，係「單綫式」，不與其他外勤發生關係，僅受總部指揮。）　　記得從前德國卜托少校的「歐戰回憶錄」中，叙述德皇威廉第三皇子潛踪赴美，混跡碼頭工人中，專在軍工原料堆棧裏，用化學方式放火。好幾個大堆棧，半夜無故自燃起來。美國的損失，非常重大。（此項作風，係單綫式，雖有規定目標，有權獨斷獨行，不與其他間謀聯繫）。　　後來這側放火的神秘皇子，禁美國情報部高手幹員，偵察出來，把臥病在床的皇子也捕獲了。其時就有德國前駐美外交大員，在瑞士出面交涉，願以四位德國所俘的美國將官，走馬換將。美國外交部本有允意，但情報部堅執不可。　　C自德國歸來，他離開祖國怱匆之間已經十來年了。世事多變，白雲蒼狗·尤其是這最動盪得厲害的十年，眞是不禁其滄桑之感·　　乍到上海的前兩天，笑話百出。什末佛郎呀，金鎊呀，美金呀，法幣呀；光是幣制問題獨泊漫談  王聰　　就使這位學貫中西的大博士頭痛不已。我突然想起「車同軌，書同文」的兩句話，　想春秋戰國時的紛　局面，秦始皇的「混一車書」眞是歷史的奇勛。　　有一天，我和C姊乘公共汽車，C姊搶着買票。那神氣好像是要大請客的樣子。　　「你究竟是從德國來的？還是從　太來的？」顯然的，我的話裏滿溢着　嘲的意思。　　C姊笑了，過了一會，她鄭重其事地問我；「現在的公共汽車票很貴吧，，要幾十萬」，　　這句話也許會使民國三十五年六月的上海市民發笑，然而，如果將現在的物價預告十年前的朋友，不是他們也同樣地會引起為荒謬麽？簡直是不可思議的，五十萬元一擔米，人不全都餓死完了麽？可是，奇怪的是我們還沒有餓死。阿門！自由談人物誌　東山再起的蔣廷  平齊　　去年十月八日的晚上，逸園飯店舉行了一個情緒相當熱烈的鷄尾酒會，主人是行總的全體職員，舉行酒會的原因是歡送剛剛辭職的行總署長蔣廷　先生。　　那時候，美國有三家大學來電請蔣先生去執敎；北大校長胡適，淸華校長梅貽琦也搶着來電報羅致。然而，蔣先生却告訴我：他決定無論如何先休息兩個月再說。　　最近，聯合國遠東經濟會議在上海召開了，英美蘇各國的代表團中，大多是和聯總有關的人物—如英國有邢德女士，美國有吉爾配屈律克，蘇聯有塞米那斯。但是，出人意料的是中國的代表團中却並無現任行總署長霍寳樹的名字，倒是蔣延黻在沉默了八個月之後東山再起，出任中國的首席代表，而且是以絕大多數被選為大會的主席了。　　蔣氏的再起並不偶然。事實上，這次會塲上的空氣相當緊張，處理也相當棘手，蘇聯代表一秉他們在一切國際會議中的作風，總是不斷地做偏鋒文章，連外交家的禮貌和涵養都表現得很差，而偏又來了一個桴鼓相應的印度代表，發言特別多，戰鬥性特別强。一度主持會塲的副主席菲律賓代表，就弄得有些進退維谷—可是，在蔣氏主持之下，却一切進行得非常順利，會塲上一切來勢險惡的風浪，終于都能安然渡過。　　處理這種會塲，小有差池，便損害了整個國家的體面·但是蔣氏却正具備了處理這種會塲的一切條件：第一是有魄力；第二是有決斷；第三是他的洽史的修養，使他有把問題條分縷析後很快就歸納出幾個要點的能力，往往別人說了大半天，也祇須兩三句話便不偏不倚地包括了全部要旨；第四，是他的聲望—儘管他在行總任內的工作在國內引起了若干方而的不滿，但是他那種「合則留不合則去」的骨氣，在國際上却祇造成了更高的聲望。　　但是，蔣氏還具備了兩個極優越的條件，這兩個條件將來必然會使他有更輝煌的成就：第一個條件是：他是一個精通蘇聯情形的人。在大戰初期，他就估計蘇聯不會就對日本用兵，當時雖遭許多所謂「親蘇人士」的打擊，但結果證明了他見解之正確。第二個條件是：他同時也是一個眞正了解美國的人。他對美國的估計，正確性也不在對蘇估計之下。他在行總任內，美國報章對他的讚揚是幾乎衆口一辭的，而這次在遠東經濟會議中的成就又博得了無數采聲。無論中國將來是否願意成為美蘇間的橋樑—蔣廷黻這樣的人總不應該再「凍結」起來了。明太祖軼事  季明　　先外祖嘗藏有洪武墨寳一幀，上題：「邵康節推演周易，朕甚寳之」十二字，筆力古拙，雖鍾王不過也。按朱氏為我國平民革命之第二人，幼乏敎育，長而為憎，其不學無術，輕蔑儒生，正與漢高祖同，所稍異者，即高祖之宰輔，類多張良之言黃老，蕭何之重刀筆，無一名實相符之儒者，而朱氏之左右，儘多宋濂，劉羣之輩，潛移默化，敎以儒術，故失氏為吳王時，即能自草救令，此駁奏剳，甚且興之所至，其詩詞亦有足觀者。「虞初續志」載：太祖下江南時徵行至某寺，遍視廊廡，傲然自得，寺僧因出緣簿請題，太祖不答，固請之，遂大書一絕於壁，曰：「殺盡江南百萬兵，腰間寳劍血猶腥，山僧不識英明主，只顧曉曉問姓名。」寺僧大駭，俟其去，然後以水洗凈之，比即帝位，飭使往視，則曩日所題，已不復在焉。帝大怒，盡拘寺僧，擬下於獄，其一僧亦工詩，因奏日；「御筆提詩不敢留，留時常恐鬼神愁，故將法水輕輕洗，猶有毫光射斗牛一。帝回嗔作喜，遂盡赦諸僧，並敕封焉。沉鬱的笑  卜束　　——讀「白季眉敎授」　　前幾期的「人物雜誌」中有一篇文華君的「白季眉敎授」，作者的感慨是深沉的，　後老是使人不能忘懷。他寫出了一個科學家的良心，也寫出了社會對於科學家的壓抑，損害和無視。白季眉敎授的善良，反峽出了社會的殘酷；他的辛勤工作的結果是「工作十年變不富，一朝休息就斷炊」，又反映了一個科學家，一個大學敎授遠不如「改授跳舞」為有出路。　　白季眉敎授的科學著作很不少，算種數，至少十二種；算字數，至少一千萬。這些作品包括普通測量學，高等測量學，大地測量學，平面測量學，水文測量學，鐵路測量學，應用天文學，最小自乘法，地圖學，航海學，航空測量學，礦山測量學，數理地理學等。要是在別的國家，他的社會地位是可想而知的，然而他不幸生在中國，所以直到目前，他的生活和一般小職員相同：　　「家是用手可以探住頂子的平房，一間大房分成五小間，其中有一間是廚房，鴨子有時會飛到客人的背上找吃的，白敎授一面照料孩子，一面用掃簧來　走那些可惡的畜牲，窗子前是另一家人例污水做飯的地方，變黑了的牆上，有夏天的蒼蠅屎，……他有很多的子女，全家大小都指望他，家裏沒有男僕女傭，事無巨細，都是躬自為之。担水，掃地，都由他自己動手，一付對國家極有用的腦子，一身對人類極有用處的精力，就這樣在家中消耗盡了。」（文華君語）　　這就是白季眉敎授辛勤工作數十年的結局。他幾次為出版商所欺，一次由干接恰「復日堰」的事，甚至還被一個無賴（以前還是他的學生）打倒在地，吐了血。為了迫於貧困，他曾經兩次大拍賣衣物，其中包括字與和辭源。一個好人的結局，一個淳厚，善良，衷心想為社會做點工作的人的結局，竟是這樣慘。這樣窘，雖然在英國和印度都有外國記者為他不平，然而請看看中國社會的反響吧：依然是壓抑和無視。　　文華君幾次在文中提到白季眉敎授的微笑：遭了出版商的欺騙，他沉鬱地一笑；當人們為他的遭遇感到不平時，他又沉鬱地一笑。　　多可憫的笑呵！我不敢想像。閉起眼睛，我彷彿看　了這位善良的白髮老人的身影，他苦笑着，無所企求，無所盼望，他的笑顯示了他的無畏，他的笑對於這社會是個無比辛辣的諷刺！　　想想那些囂張的狂呼吧：中國為付麽沒有愛因斯坦？為什麽沒有居里夫人？為什麽沒有愛迪生，為付慶沒有巴爾札克　托爾斯泰？……　　就在這樣的呼聲裏，多少偉大的科學家或藝術家文學家全沒沒無聞地倒斃了，在工作過分的環境中未老先衰了，受了損害　侮辱而化為一絲苦笑，抑鬱以　了。旅美什錦  徐茲園　　美國之輔助敎育　　美國敎育之所以發達，並不在學校之冬，建築之精，設儲之廣，而在制度之善。他們的制度比較富有彈性，適應社會各階層之需要。中國的敎育制度雖然取　美國，却未能取其所長，遂流為形式化的敎育，專以考試約束青年，而且求學成為一種職業，靠津貼和貸金維持，並世界敎育之天荒。　　美國高等敎育取費頗昂，省立大學以每學期計，約在二十五元左右，私立大學以學分計者，每學分約十元至二十元，以學期計者，每學期五百元以上，如哈佛大學，芝加哥大學等，良以普及敎育在小學而不在大學。中國適得其反，小學徵收寶物，大學免費，反有津貼，菲生長中國者不知其吳妙也。　　美國各大學尤設有研究院，恒於晚　七時至十時上課，便利職業者公務員及律師　生等入學研究，其不能列席者可入函授班，但函授班之學分可俳入學士學位所需學分計算，而不適用於碩士及博士學位。　　各大學為便利市區學生計，大卒在市區設有講授班Exeension，凡有志研究某一個問題者，集合若干人即可請求當地大學特設一斑，在指定地點上授，由學校派敎授前往宣講。美國軍部為使被　壯丁在前綫作戰時可繼續求學起見，特設有軍事函授學校一所，附設於明尼蘇陸大學內，所列學科多至數百種，由全美各大學之函授部分担講義及改卷，按期將講義郵寄各戰塲受業人，所得學分與正式入學校上課者同，故多數未在大學畢業之軍人，作戰數年歸來，則大學文憑已穩然到手，故在美國求學之遙殊多，不必坐在課堂裏始可求學，住在家中，躲在戰　內，潛在太平洋潛艇中，均可修成學業，大學敎育既非專家絕業，自應求其普遍，學殖不可風積居奇，大學敎育宜擴展至校門以外。（八）國力外交  苞卿　　國際間的局面，本是力的對峙的局面。國家若有雄厚的國力，造成健全的政治，則反映在外交上，也一定易於掌握勝利的左券了，而發言才不至為人所輕。不然，則雖善蒸使用縱橫捭闔之策略。或小有成功，終歸難免失敗。所以今天的外交，是「國力外交」。弱國要在這個權力政治的世界生存，就惟有講求增强國力之道，或且利用國際均勢，或保持中立，或則結納强鄰以圖存了。　　R.L.　Buell說：「各國為確保其安全，其椎力，及其人民的權利起見，到了萬不得已的時候，總不能訴諸法律，而必須訴諸其自身所有的實力，軍備　以武力為後盾的外交。」（國際關係論）日本政論家稻源治勝且說：「和平的戰爭是外交，不和平的外交是戰爭。」所以外交有「潛在性的戰爭」之稱。因外交之後即為軍力，若國際爭議無法以外交方式解決，繼其後而遂來戰爭。故軍力是解決國際爭議的最重要最常用而且最後的工具。而軍力的充資，則有賴人力健全，財才雄厚了。　　「九一八」時，史汀生氏欲恃強硬外交對付日本，但詢知海軍方面凖備不夠，其政策遂不能生效。此次大戰前之列強爭相擴軍，大戰後的原子彈問題的爭議，也無非爭外交之堅強後盾，在戰爭時，員藉外交運用，而無國力為後盾則殷鋻非遠：大戰初，法國被納粹戰敗、即造因於「法國兒女本少，軍械太少，友軍太少。」（貝常語）而如捷克雖賴外交　存，至危機日重，也積極注意實力之培養，雖國小力弱被浸略而受納粹控制，但已立今後復興之整。納粹麗王希特勒在其「我的奮鬥」中所說：「圖以武力得你所欲，你需要強，圖以交涉得你所欲，作需要更强。」其言確是有部份的至理。　　過去弱國利用特殊的外交方式：如暹羅，波蘭利用列强均勢來維持國家。比利時和瑞士處於軍略要點，列強逐鹿之地，遂得被承認為永久中立國。南美各國到大都結納合衆國，甸爾巴尼亞及奧國在戰前聽命於意德，皆為結納强鄰。但是這些國家，雖採用了特殊外交方式，却處處須仰人鼻息。國家自己旣無實力，因而在戰時因時異境變，輒不崇朝而被蹂躪於鐵蹄下，實是可悲。故弱國祗能利用國際形勢，自强自立，若藉以偸生，則難兔為人附庸，此所以不能不注重國力外交也。　　我國近百年來，因國力微弱，雖地大物博人衆，但未能建立健全的國力政治，遂使外交軟弱無力，而奇恥大辱累累發生。日俄戰爭中，東三省為彼等之戰塲；第一次世界大戰時，日軍攻靑島：我國竟成為別國之交戰塲，可恥可痛可見。民國以來，僅賴美國所力主的「門戶開放」及「九國公約」以圖存。此次大戰中，卒能與美英蘇成為盟國，列入五强之林，開羅會議時之中國聲譽最為高盛，也無非我國堅決抗戰，為民族存亡作殊死戰，忍耐持久而力求自强自立、外交政策遂亦藉國力表現，而能圓滿達成。在此戰後之今日，實不堪回憶旣往。如何以謀我國力之强盛，外交之勝利乎？科學小品夢的科學（三）　我們能解釋自己的夢嗎？  顧均正　　權威者說夢是無法解釋的？因為夢是一種非常雜複的現象，僅僅對於做夢的人才有意義可說。假使張三夢中為一水牛所追逐，意義如彼；而你做這個要，意義却可以完全不同。一個心理學家要正確地解釋一個夢，就首先要研究這做夢的人的人格，然後把夢的要點跟夢者的思想感覺與經騐串聯起來。　　過去的那種「詳夢書」以及其他夢的迷信大都根據着古代占卜的傳說，不但無用，並且若是把牠看得太嚴重了，反而是有害的。　　夢可以由身體上的故障與食物等而引起嗎？　　可以的有些夢確是由這樣的原因所引起。例如，褥墊下陷會引起身體下掉的夢。我們的下意識為了要使身體的感覺合理化，就創造出空想的夢的解釋來。然而由身體感覺所惹起的夢，其性質常受下意識的狀况之影響。有人實騐，用羽毛來搔撤睡者的鼻子，各人所做的夢常常是不同的。　　食物也偶然會刺激起夢，最容易致夢的是新鮮的鳳梨，香蕉，胡瓜與西瓜等。不過大多數的夢都不是由實質的刺激而引起的·　　夢大都有潛在的性的意義，這是眞的嗎？　　許多權咸學者都不同意弗洛伊特學派的觀念。美國塔克塔斯大學克萊英敎授（Prof.D.R.Klein）經周詳的研究，發現與性慾有關的夢不過百分之十.其他研究者也都支持這g　個說法.所以你不用躭心把你的夢告訴別人.　　做一個夢要多少時間　　由電的測量，指出大多數的夢只有兩三分鐘。實際上我們記得起力所有的夢，都是在早上睡醒前幾分鐘裏發生的，一經覺醒，差不多立即就模糊了。　　誰最會做夢？　　由研究指出，女子比男子易於得夢。大槪年齡在二十到三十之間人，也容易得夢；反之老年人則得夢較少。</p>

<h3>Government Statement on the Current Situation to be Announced After Approval by the State Council Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st dispatch] The government's statement on the current situation and policy decisions will be announced after the State Council meeting. It is rumored that after the announcement of this statement, all economic, political, and military affairs will adopt a wartime system, such as strengthening conscription, grain requisition, and price controls. All parties are extremely concerned about this move by the government. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party both intend to conduct research on this matter internally.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st dispatch] After the joint meeting of the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee yesterday, according to well-informed sources, after discussing the methods for dealing with the current situation, it was resolved to request the government to issue a national mobilization order to concentrate all forces to eliminate the Communist Party. This resolution will be passed at the next State Council meeting and announced by the government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Propaganda of the Youth Party, recently told reporters regarding the current situation: "If the country does not suppress the Communists, the Communists will suppress the country." He also stated that the Youth Party, since participating in the National Assembly, is equivalent to having declared war on the Communist Party. However, the most important thing at present is to improve local politics and establish local armed forces to ensure the peace and stability of local order. When the reporter asked about the Youth Party's opinion on the upcoming general election, Zuo said: The Youth Party advocates adopting a business-like approach and electing according to proportions; otherwise, the Youth Party would rather withdraw from the election. The current government has agreed to this in principle and is only studying the procedures for implementation.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Sino-U.S. Phone Calls</h3>
<p>The Telecommunications Bureau completed the installation of Sino-U.S. wireless telephone equipment in late May and has been testing the calls day and night for a month. The initial results were very good. Recently, due to sunspots affecting the transmission of speech waves, the current call time is tentatively set from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the number of people registering at the Telecommunications Bureau was very crowded, totaling 37 households. However, only nine calls were made last night, including Mayor Wu's return call. This newspaper accounted for two calls. One was a call from Jack Deker, editor of the Hearst Daily News in New York, to Wu Jiatang, the interviewing director of this newspaper, which was also the first Sino-U.S. commercial telephone call. The second was a call from the editing department of this newspaper to Lu Qixin, the Central News Agency correspondent stationed in Washington.</p>
<p>The Long Distance Division of the Telecommunications Bureau tested the calls for four consecutive nights in preparation for yesterday's return call ceremony. Division Chief Wu Zhengda, team leader Miss Pu, and six Misses in the switchboard room were all sleepless for four nights.</p>
<p>The wireless telephone originally had two lines, allowing two pairs of people to talk at the same time. Unexpectedly, one line suddenly had a temporary failure yesterday, and only one line was available. Therefore, inquiries about telephone calls after 10:00 PM yesterday came one after another, and the Misses at the registration desk were too busy to respond.</p>
<p>The wireless telephone transmitter is located in Zhenru, the receiver is located in Liuhang, and the terminal and long-distance station are located in the Hengbang Bridge Telecommunications Bureau. Therefore, one call to the United States has to go through dozens of connections, and dozens of service personnel are involved.</p>
<p>The charge for a three-minute call is US$12, which, converted at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, is only 140,000 legal currency, which is cheaper than a telegram. However, the Telecommunications Bureau is suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>If the sunspots do not disappear, a maximum of ten or so calls can be made each day. According to the contract, incoming and outgoing calls must be used alternately by both China and the United States (i.e., ten calls per day, five of which are from China to the United States, and the remaining five are from the United States to China). According to the current registered users, it is "fully booked for three days."</p>

<h3>A World as One Family · Friendly Exchange: Sino-U.S. Wireless Telephone Service Restored; Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Holds Grand Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Sino-U.S. wireless telephone service was restored and officially opened at 10:00 PM yesterday. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau held a restoration ceremony in the conference room on the second floor of the bureau on Sichuan North Road. Mayor Wu, San Francisco Mayor Lapham, and our Ambassador to the U.S., Gu Weijun, held the first conversation. Yu Bingjian, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, and Wu Zhengda, Er Baiyu, and other senior staff were fully mobilized. From around 9:00 AM, guests from all walks of life arrived at the bureau one after another. Those present included Mayor Wu and his wife, Zhang Bide, Director of the Liaison Section of the Municipal Government, Fulmai of China Electric Company, Ashap of the Telephone Company, Weikesen, Wei Jingmeng, and over 50 reporters from various newspapers. The venue was decorated with Chinese and American flags, and in the center was a large silver inscription that read, "Commemorating the Restoration of Sino-U.S. Wireless Telephone Service." A special correspondent from the Central Film Studio was also present to film the news, and the mercury lamps illuminated the venue as bright as day. At 9:57 AM, Mayor Wu and his wife walked into the conference room and were seated by Director Yu and Engineer Zong Zhifa, marking the beginning of the restoration ceremony. Ladies reported the program in Chinese and English in turn. First, Director Yu reported on the process of restoring the service. He briefly stated: "The Sino-U.S. international wireless telephone service began in March of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], with trial calls between Shanghai and San Francisco, USA. In May of the same year, the service was officially opened. However, due to the outbreak of the 'August 13th' incident, it was suspended. After the victory [of the war], due to international circumstances, in February of this year, our bureau, together with the International Radio Station, began preparations for the service. In addition to the original international telecommunications staff, we recruited and trained international telephone operators and installed an international long-distance switchboard. At the same time, the International Radio Station began installing the dual-channel single-sideband wireless telephone manufactured by Western Electric Company. The work was completed and trial calls were made in May of this year. The original trial call time was scheduled from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM. However, after two months of trial calls, we found that the change in the Heaviside layer during the daytime was very large, not as clear and good as at night. After discussion, it was decided to officially open the evening calls between Shanghai, Nanjing, and various parts of the United States starting from today (summer time is from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM)."</p>
<p>After Mr. Yu finished his speech, the "Hello Shanghai" call from San Francisco came from the loudspeaker in the left corner of the venue, which was exceptionally clear.</p>
<p>San Francisco Mayor Lapham</p>
<p>The Two Mayors of China and the United States Communicate First</p>
<p>Emphasizing That the World Is Indivisible. At 10:10 PM, Mayor Wu began to talk with San Francisco Mayor Lapham. Mr. Wu asked first: "I am Mayor Wu, I want to talk to the Mayor of San Francisco." The voice of an American female operator came from the amplifier: "He is here." Then Lapham's heavy and nasal "Hello" sound was heard. Mayor Wu smiled and said: "Is this Mayor Lapham? How are you? How is the weather?" Lapham replied: "Very good." Mayor Wu then read a congratulatory message, saying: "Mayor Lapham, I am very honored to be able to talk to you at the time of the restoration of Sino-U.S. telephone service. I hereby extend my congratulations to you and the citizens of San Francisco on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai. A week ago, I met and talked with you in Shanghai. Within a few days, you have flown back to the United States across half the world. This is the progress of science! You can travel around the world in a few days, and complete the wireless telephone connection between Shanghai and San Francisco in a few minutes. Credibility and friendship are built on mutual understanding. Sino-U.S. friendship has always been very strong. Since the sailing ship era, the United States has had friendly exchanges with China. Even when transportation was very slow, and it took months or even years to travel from the New World to the East, the United States showed sincere concern for China. Now, rapid transportation and convenient transportation will further enhance this concern and mutual understanding between the people of the two countries. What is more, the world is indivisible. The problem of any country is also the problem of other countries. The suffering of any country will immediately affect other countries, and the peace and order of any place can be shared by other places. The Sino-U.S. relationship is very close. In the solution between us on the Pacific, we must obtain help from the other side of the Pacific. The opening of the Sino-U.S. wireless telephone tonight can be said to have entered a new stage in Sino-U.S. friendship and cooperation. This is another tool that can make friendship strong and cooperation effective, can make communication and message transmission fast, thus increasing understanding, and the world is like one family. We will connect Shanghai and San Francisco like a big city, stretching from one shore of the Pacific to the other." After Mayor Wu finished reading, Lapham told him: "Very clear." Then Lapham also delivered a eulogy to Sino-U.S. friendship. At that time, it was about 4:00 AM in San Francisco, so Mayor Wu wished Lapham "Good morning," and Lapham wished Wu "Good evening." They said goodbye to each other in laughter.</p>
<p>Mayor and Ambassador Express Mutual Greetings</p>
<p>The Friendship Between the Two Countries Is Getting Closer</p>
<p>At 10:23 PM, Mayor Wu continued to talk with Ambassador Gu Weijun in Washington. Gu said: "It's night on your side, but it's early morning here. You have worked hard for the citizens." Wu said: "No, the ambassador is working hard for the country." Mr. Wu then slowly read a speech, briefly saying:</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu: Now we are in Washington and Shanghai, separated by a vast ocean and land. I never thought that we would be able to speak to each other through radio today, as if we were very close. Modern science has shortened the distance of time and space, and simply made us forget the height and distance of the sky and despise the vastness of the universe. At this moment, we seem to be in the same room, having a heart-to-heart talk.</p>
<p>Some people praise the omnipotence of science, and some people curse the evil of science. Today, facing this transmitter and listening to the words of friends from afar, we cannot but pay sincere worship and admiration to science. Perhaps we can say that science itself has no good or evil.</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu: When we are talking about the world through wireless telephone tonight, there must be many Chinese and American people who are talking about the news of the restoration of Sino-U.S. international wireless telephone service after tea and dinner. They may feel that the people of China and the United States have added a way to exchange information from today. The traditional friendship between China and the United States has added another layer of connection.</p>
<p>That's right. After the restoration of Sino-U.S. international radio telephone service, it not only reduces the gap between the people of the two countries and increases friendship with each other. There are also overseas Chinese in the United States, who are very concerned about their motherland, and the motherland also misses them. Now, with the wireless telephone, they can express their condolences to each other.</p>
<p>The world is originally one family, and in the new world after the war, we have no need to deny this fact. There is no doubt that this new type of telecommunications equipment will promote the friendship and cooperation between the two countries and move forward. Finally, I hope that Ambassador Gu will often bring good news from Washington to us, and please tell the American people and overseas Chinese in the United States to talk to us more often. I wish Ambassador Gu good health.</p>
<p>After reading, the Ambassador expressed his great pleasure at the clarity of the wireless telephone and asked Mayor Wu to convey his regards to President Chiang and Vice President Sun, and asked about the situation in Shanghai. Mayor Wu told him that Shanghai was very stable, and asked when the Ambassador could return home for a visit. The Ambassador replied that he would not be able to return home for a short rest until his work was over. The conversation ended at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Next, Director Yu and Zong, the managing engineer of the International Radio Station, spoke to Thomson, the representative of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, respectively. Finally, a film about the business of the Telecommunications Bureau was shown, and the Telecommunications Bureau also entertained the guests with refreshments. The restoration ceremony ended late at night. (The conversation between our newspaper and the United States is published on page 2)</p>

<h3>Japanese Reparations Ships Set Sail for Shanghai; Eight Ships, Large and Small, Expected to Arrive Tomorrow Afternoon; Ceremony Scheduled for the 6th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Three Japanese destroyers and five escort destroyers allocated to our country departed Sasebo at noon today for Shanghai, including the 2,490-ton destroyer "Kaze" and the escort destroyer "Yotsushiro." These nine vessels are the first batch of the best Japanese ships out of the ninety-two ships drawn by the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union for distribution. All the eight vessels allocated to our country are being sailed by Japanese sailors and are expected to arrive in Shanghai in forty-eight hours. The Japanese sailors will return to Japan on July 6th. The allocation of the second batch of Japanese ships will be held in Tokyo after the Japanese crew members return from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places. This morning, the reporter visited our representative who attended the drawing on June 28th. He refused to comment on the media reports that the United States would allocate the Japanese vessels it received to our country for use as target ships in Qingdao. It is said that any such arrangement should be based on negotiations between Qingdao U.S. Naval Commander Kirk and our authorities.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The first batch of eight warships and one escort vessel compensated to our country by Japan sailed from Sasebo at noon on the 1st and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 3rd. The First Naval District Headquarters will send the "Meihong" warship and two coast guard boats to the mouth of the Yangtze River to guide the Japanese ships into the port and berth on the Jiangmian River in Shangchangmiao. It is reported that the Japanese warships are flying two types of flags during their voyage to China: one is the Japanese rusty ship flag, and the other is the international E green-edged flag (red on the top and blue on the bottom, which is a symbol of compensated warships). The original names and tonnages of the ships are as follows: the "Kaze" destroyer, 2,490 tons; the "Yotsusaka" destroyer, 1,780 tons; the "Tsuta" destroyer, 1,530 tons; the remaining five are escort destroyers: the "Shizaki" 1,020 tons, "No. 14," "No. 194," both 900 tons, "No. 67," "No. 215," both 810 tons, with a total tonnage of 10,040 tons. All the ships are manned by Japanese sailors, and the liaison officer Zhong Hanbo sent by our country and a U.S. Navy lieutenant are escorting the team. All Japanese personnel will return to Japan on the escort vessel seventy-two hours after the warships arrive in our country.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy has scheduled a formal acceptance ceremony at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy in Gaochangmiao on the 6th, and a solemn flag-raising ceremony will be held at the same time. Fang, Commander of the First District, will host this grand ceremony on behalf of Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing. Leaders from all walks of life in the city and news reporters will be invited to attend the ceremony, and the Central Film Studio will film the news at the time.</p>
<p>Regarding the custody and training after the acceptance of the ships, the Naval Headquarters telegraphed the First Base Command on the 1st to establish a "Ship Reception Office" to be responsible for this work. The office is divided into six sections, including ship affairs, training, and technology, and is headed by Yang Daozhao, director of the Sixth Department of the headquarters, and Mai Shiyao, captain of the "Taiping" warship, also serves as the director. The new names and captain candidates of each ship have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the second batch of 32 warships compensated by Japan to China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, of which our country will receive eight, will be shipped to China before the end of this month, and the third batch of 18 vessels, of which our country will receive seven.</p>
<h3>National Economic Commission Holds Meeting Today to Review Economic Reform Plan; Fifth Meeting Scheduled for Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The National Economic Commission is scheduled to hold a plenary review meeting in the afternoon on the 2nd to review the economic reform plan. The meeting was originally scheduled to be held on the 1st, but was postponed to the 2nd for some reason. The fifth meeting of the commission is scheduled to be held on the 3rd to discuss the following major issues: (1) Economic Reform Plan, which will be formally discussed based on the review opinions and will be legally ratified in principle. (2) The issue of repaying fixed deposits in banks before and during the war. According to the measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance, pre-war deposits refer to those deposited before July 1937 that have not been withdrawn due to the outbreak of the war. As the prices were stable and the interest rates were uniform at that time, the interest for that period will still be calculated on a monthly basis using compound interest at the original interest rate at that time. Wartime deposits refer to deposits made from July 1937 to August 1945 that have not been withdrawn when the area was occupied. The average interest rate of major cities will be used to determine the standard annual interest rate for the years 1937 to 1945, and then calculated on a monthly basis using compound interest (the compound interest of ordinary bank deposits is calculated every six months), with the highest multiplier being 678 times. The small review committee of the former Economic Commission supplemented two points: 1. It is still too low to repay at a maximum of 678 times, and it is planned to find ways to increase the multiplier (some committee members advocated 700 times). 2. The Four Banks Joint Office should conduct a detailed survey of the total amount of such deposits in all state-owned banks, commercial banks, and to inform and calculate before re-approving its repayment method. A concrete decision may be made at this general meeting. (3) The issue of selling state-owned enterprises, the organization of the supervisory committee will be discussed and expanded. (4) Other urgent economic issues.</p>
<h3>News Magazine Registration Cancellation Co-review Method</h3>
<p>Handled Solely by the Ministry of Interior</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] An official from the Ministry of Interior stated that "Regarding the registration and issuance of licenses for news magazines nationwide, the Ministry, and the provincial, municipal, and county governments have always followed Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, and other articles of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Publication Law, and jointly reviewed with the Central Propaganda Department and their respective party departments at the same level. Now, as we prepare for the constitutional period, the current co-review system is no longer necessary. The Ministry has approved the Central Propaganda Department's request to cancel the co-review method. In the future, matters related to the registration of news magazines should be handled solely by government agencies. The Ministry has notified the provincial and municipal governments to comply."</p>

Madame Chiang said in a speech at the meeting that the construction plan for the vast rural areas of China, the welfare, education, and leadership is arduous. The current work is only a drop in the bucket, but we can make the current work "produce the yeast-like action of bread" and make the people spontaneous and automatic. Madame Chiang also said that when she and President Chiang were walking out of the room yesterday, they saw that the rice transplanting work had been completed everywhere, which made them very happy, and said, "Now that the rice transplanting is over, half of the harvest has been obtained!"</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Henan Violates Its Promise and Destroys the River Restoration Work; Forcibly Crosses the River and Occupies Dongkou</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 1st] The Communist army Liu Bocheng's unit, which had gathered in Puyang, Puxian, and Fanxian counties, forcibly crossed the river in Dongkou at 12:00 PM last night with the cover of artillery fire. The defending army did not fight back because military operations were suspended during the construction period. Dongkou was then occupied by the Communist army. Liu Bocheng arrived at Qingzuji in Bandongming Village on the opposite bank yesterday to direct acts of hindering the river restoration and destroying the dikes. His breach of promise, the sudden crossing of the river and invasion in the area where military operations were suspended, and disregard for the lives of tens of millions of people are infuriating. In addition, the Second Column of Liu's unit, which was entrenched in Puyang, also sneaked to the Yellow River bank last night in an attempt to cross the river and invade the south.</p>

<h3>The Water Level of the Qiantang River Rises; The Seawalls on Both Sides Are Safe</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st] Due to the moldy rain, the water level in Zhenjiang rose, and the seawalls on both sides were rumored to be collapsing. This dangerous period can be safely survived. The engineering projects of the 35th year of the Bureau of Hydraulic Engineering have been completed one after another. After the central government approved an appropriation of 8.6 billion yuan for the 36th year of the project, preparatory work has been actively started.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 1st] Guangzhou's conversion to a municipality directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, which was desired by more than one million citizens, was realized on July 1st. People from all walks of life here held a recreational assembly, and all shops in the city celebrated with flags, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic situation. As for the municipal government, no ceremony was held. Mayor Ouyang was originally scheduled to be sworn in on the 1st, but because the supervisor Zhang Fakuai happened to fly to Nanjing, he only took office first today, and will hold the inauguration ceremony later. After the conversion to a municipality directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, the establishment has not yet been approved by the central government, so it will temporarily follow the original establishment. As for future new municipal plans, Mayor Ouyang said that he is a pragmatist and never makes grand statements in advance. In the future, he will give priority to the urgent needs of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for the Reorganization of Local Security Forces in Northern Jiangsu Have Been Established; Approved by the Army Headquarters for Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 1st] The local security and self-defense forces in the counties of northern Jiangsu are in a chaotic state, with uneven quality and lax discipline. Often, due to lack of supplies, they distribute burdens and disturb the people, and cannot fully exert the power to protect the countryside and the people. Li Mo'an, commander of the First Security District, summoned special commissioners and county magistrates to review and research, and formulated guidelines for the reorganization of local troops, which have been submitted to the Army General Headquarters through the provincial government for approval. The summary of the content is as follows: (1) All systems such as organization, equipment, personnel, and management are listed. (2) Each county shall, depending on its economic conditions and the needs of public security, strengthen small units based on the current number of personnel and weapons. When public security is better, they will be gradually demobilized. (3) The unusable weapons will be eliminated and handed over to the militia, and the county will take charge of the distribution. (4) The treatment and meals will be planned and paid together to avoid floating amounts and repeated charges. (5) One or two large teams shall be selected as mobile units, and the county magistrate, party, and agencies may use them in a mobile manner. (6) Cadres shall be promoted and selected from outstanding military officers with pure thoughts and combat experience, and the deputy battalion commander may request the dispatch of assistance from the National Army. (7) Inspection teams and review teams shall be established separately to conduct strict and thorough examinations and rewards and punishments. (8) Generous compensation shall be given for casualties. (9) The reorganization shall be completed by July 15.</p>

<h3>As if Meeting Face-to-Face Despite Being Separated by Vast Oceans: The First Commercial Telephone Calls Between China and the United States Were Both Initiated by This Newspaper</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Yesterday, the first commercial telephone call from the United States to China was received by this newspaper, and the first commercial telephone call from China to the United States was also made by this newspaper. Therefore, it can be said that the opening ceremony of commercial telephone communication between China and the United States was held at this newspaper.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers Between This Newspaper's Reporter and Mr. Decker</p>
<p>Incoming Call</p>
<p>The call from the United States was connected at 11 p.m. It was Mr. Decker (Jack Tncder), an editor at the New York American Daily, calling Mr. Wu Jiahui, the chief of the interviewing department of this newspaper. Mr. Wu received a notice from the Telecommunications Bureau the night before, saying that a Mr. Decker would be calling him. Sure enough, the call came through on time yesterday.</p>
<p>It turned out that Mr. Decker did not know Mr. Wu, but only saw the telegraphic dispatches he sent out in foreign newspapers. So, before the call, he first asked if he could speak English.</p>
<p>Then, the first question Mr. Decker asked him was, "What is the black market price of US dollars in Shanghai?" When Mr. Wu told him that this was a serious violation of the law and he could not reveal it, Mr. Decker couldn't help but laugh. The following is their conversation:</p>
<p>Decker: "How many American soldiers are still in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>Wu: "Very few, about two hundred or so."</p>
<p>Decker: "How is their behavior?"</p>
<p>Wu: "Very good."</p>
<p>Decker: "Are there any Japanese soldiers left?"</p>
<p>Wu: "Almost all have returned, only a few technical personnel remain."</p>
<p>Decker: "What is the biggest news published in Shanghai newspapers today?"</p>
<p>Wu: "The joint meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee decided to strengthen the suppression of the Communist military."</p>
<p>Decker: "How is the climate in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>Wu: "The highest is 82.3 degrees."</p>
<p>Later, when Mr. Wu asked him what the climate was like in New York today, Mr. Decker replied that it was 80 degrees.</p>
<p>At this time, the operator reported that the call time was up, and the conversation ended.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers Between Lu Qixin and This Newspaper's Reporter</p>
<p>Outgoing Call</p>
<p>The call between this newspaper and Lu Qixin, a special correspondent of the Central News Agency in Washington, D.C., was connected at 12:17 a.m. this morning. It was also the first telephone call from China to the United States. When the reporter talked to Mr. Lu, who was 7,509 miles away, in the editor-in-chief's office, the voice was clear and distinct, giving the feeling of a face-to-face conversation in the same room. The conversation lasted eleven minutes before ending. When Mr. Lu was talking to the reporter, he was in the Washington, D.C. office of the Central News Agency. It was noon, the sun was shining brightly, and the heat was oppressive, with the thermometer reading 90 degrees.</p>
<p>In the phone call, Mr. Lu first expressed his greetings to Mr. Chen Xun, the editor-in-chief of this newspaper, and his colleagues. Then, the conversation officially began. The reporter first asked about the U.S. reaction to the decision made at the joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee to strengthen the suppression of the Communist military. Mr. Lu said, "All the major American newspapers published it in large font today, but there was no reaction." The reporter also asked, "What is the general view of the American people on the China issue?" Mr. Lu said, "After the American press giants returned from their trip around the world on Pan American planes, they made many speeches on the China issue, so the American people have become interested in the Far East and the China issue again. For example, the opinion of Mr. White, the publisher of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, is that the United States must choose strategically important and capable of revitalizing countries to support between communism and democracy; he believes that the United States can make efforts in China, Japan, and the Philippines. He said that China is the most dangerous place in the Far East.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennan, the editor-in-chief of the Christian Science Monitor, said: Both India and China are facing very serious crises of collapse. The Chinese National Government is encountering serious difficulties. However, there is no inevitable reason for China to collapse. If the spirit of the Kuomintang's revolution in the past can be used to replace the selfishness and corruption of today's government officials, then many current difficulties can be solved easily.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Lu added, "This morning, Ambassador Wei Daoming talked to Mayor O'Dwyer and then told him that this Sino-American wireless telephone call is a restart of the frequent communication network of the past, and from now on, it can also establish a post-war international communication mechanism. China and the United States are located on the east and west coasts of the Pacific Ocean, and have common and mutually beneficial goals in establishing world peace and striving for international stability. At the same time, China and the United States also have the same goal of revitalizing commerce and seeking prosperity for the people. Therefore, one of the most important points of today's call is that it can enhance the understanding between the people of the two countries."</p>

<h3>Hello, Sir?</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Last night, just as this newspaper was about to call U.S. Republican Senator Vandenberg, the speaker on the other end suddenly had a bright and sweet female voice. She greeted the reporter of this newspaper, saying, "Hello! Sir, how are you?" The reporter hurriedly asked who the other party was. She replied, "I am Tao Luosai!" The voice was very kind, as if she was blaming him for not recognizing her voice. At that time, the telecommunications bureau had also discovered the wrong connection and immediately hung up. Because of these setbacks, the call to Vandenberg was never connected.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Japanese Textile Industry Should Not Be Expanded!</h3>
<p>The China Textile Institute believes that MacArthur is biased towards the Japanese textile industry, not allowing it to be included in the list of reparations and relocation, and there is also talk of expanding Japanese spindles to 6 million to compete for the international trade market. After the members' congress, the Institute submitted a letter of protest to MacArthur, which was originally published in this newspaper on June 29. This protest letter was directly pointed out to MacArthur by Chinese industrial academic groups and does not represent the government's opinion. It is purely the awareness of the Chinese people and can be said to be the reaction of the Chinese light industry academic community to MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan. Whether this reaction is "strong" or "weak" depends on MacArthur's response. It is still too early to make a judgment. However, public opinion cannot remain silent on this major event that concerns the future of China's textile industry.</p>
<p>Japan is a country that has leaped from light industry to heavy industry. The concentration of capital and the monopoly of operations have led to the seizure of raw materials and markets by force, and the result was the outbreak of a war of aggression. The Potsdam Declaration stipulates: "Japan shall use factory equipment as compensation, and its retained industry shall be limited to maintaining its normal economic life." The spirit of this provision is to limit Japan's industry and thereby control Japan's economic development through compensation, which is quite far-sighted. It has been two years since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration. The issue of compensation is still pending, and each country has its own plan, and opinions have not converged. The most noteworthy and well-known are the report of Mr. Pauley, the U.S. President's Special Envoy for Compensation, and the report of Mr. Strike, the U.S. Military Department's Compensation Commissioner. Regarding the retention of the Japanese textile industry, Pauley advocated maintaining 3 million spindles, which the Japanese also said was not harsh; Strike's plan showed a slightly more lenient attitude and suggested: "Japan has lost Manchuria, Taiwan, and Korea after the war, and has paid a heavy price. The level of Japanese industry and the retained factory equipment should be improved." Based on this, the Far Eastern Commission passed a decision in April of this year to maintain Japan's industrial level from 1930 to 1934. 1930 was the year of Japan's capitalist leap, and the "September 18th Incident" occurred the following year; 1933 was the year Japan replaced Britain as the world's number one textile industry country, and the rapid advancement of industry and trade in 1934 marked the transition from the era of textile industry as the center to the era of heavy industries such as metal machinery and chemical products as the center.</p>
<p>China expressed great regret over the decision of the Far Eastern Commission, and those in the know believed that the United States had armed Japan and expressed protests in public opinion. As the saying goes, "Treading on frost indicates that strong ice is coming." Since the Far Eastern Commission has started the trend, MacArthur has created its system. In addition to allowing Japan to resume industrial and trade activities, it has recently allowed whaling in Antarctica and phosphorus mining in Palau. It is expected that before the San Francisco Peace Treaty is convened, Japan's economic development may become a grand sight. As for the retention of Japanese spindles, according to Pauley's investigation, Japan currently has 2,718,000 spindles after the war, and in the future, maintaining a maximum of 3 million spindles will be enough. However, MacArthur believes that the Japanese textile industry is not comparable to the military industry and plans to expand it to 6 million spindles. In addition to 1.5 million spindles producing to meet the needs of the Japanese people, the surplus production will be exported to revitalize Japanese trade. This news has not been fully confirmed. If it does become a reality, the textile industries of China, Britain, India, and Australia will once again face a strong enemy, and the future is worrying. It is hoped that the clear-minded MacArthur will not fall into this error and shake the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration!</p>
<p>In fact, the Japanese textile industry, if developed peacefully, does not need to be based on a huge number of spindles. Measuring Japanese industrial equipment from an American industrial perspective is a mistake. First, according to the calculation of the China Textile Institute: Japan has a population of 70 million, and based on 20 yards of cotton cloth per person per year, a maximum of 1.3 million spindles are more than enough, and there is no need to maintain more than 3 million spindles; second, due to the lack of cotton raw materials, most of the 2.7 million spindles in Japan after the war have not been put into operation. According to the report obtained by China National Construction Corporation, Japan has now reduced from 2.5 million spindles to 2.1 million spindles, and may be reduced to 1.9 million spindles. If it forcibly wants to expand production, it will inevitably covet cotton raw materials in North China and India and Australia, and future disputes will undoubtedly evolve into international disasters; third, Japan is making multifaceted efforts to rebuild after the war, and there is a shortage of skilled workers. During the war, many textile machines were converted to heavy industry to produce military supplies, and it is not easy to refit them. If the number of spindles is expanded to 6 million, Japan will inevitably demand loans and technical and machinery assistance from the United States. Can today's American policy help the development of defeated countries and sit idly by as the allied countries lose their opportunities for recovery? Fourth, China's textile production cannot compete with Japan's and needs to maintain a balanced development relationship with Japan. Japanese spindles can rotate 10,000 times per minute, while China can only rotate 6,000 to 7,000 times; Japan works 24 hours a day, now it is 16 hours, and the intensity of its labor is beyond the reach of Lancashire. If 6 million spindles are operating under excellent management and technology, no textile industry in the world dares to compete with it. Therefore, the redevelopment of the Japanese textile industry is a threat to world peace. This is what is making China, Britain, Australia, and other countries uneasy.</p>
<p>The above arguments show that Japan's existing spindles have reached the saturation point and do not need a large number. If the world situation is not considered and it is suddenly allowed to expand excessively, the turmoil in the Far East will be repeated, and world peace will be threatened. We do not want to make emotional criticisms of the United States' policy of controlling Japan, but we want to declare that the so-called industrial level is relative. Americans cannot look at Japan from an American standard, and should not measure everything by the pre-war level. The economies of various countries after the war have rarely returned to pre-war levels, and it is even more difficult to meet American standards. This is a fact. It is hoped that the American government and the public will face this fact squarely. If the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo is slightly negligent and approves Japan's expansion of spindles to 6 million in one breath, it will more or less disregard the life and death of the Allied countries and force the Far Eastern countries to live in constant anxiety, which is indeed a cause for concern. The protest letter from the China Textile Institute is a cry under this kind of anxiety, and it is a resonance of the voices of Britain, Australia, and other countries. It is a kind of friendly hope for MacArthur, and it is not exaggerated in terms of fact and reason. It is hoped that MacArthur will make a wise choice and use facts to comfort the people of the Allied countries! At the same time, we must point out that the San Francisco Peace Treaty should be convened as soon as possible to reasonably resolve these pending issues. China and Japan should quickly establish peaceful economic relations, and establish agreements on the possible conflicts in production between the two countries, so as to restore normal trade and establish peaceful production relations. This is the hope for the future of China and Japan.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Seems to Have a Turning Point After Almost Being Killed: Bidault's New Proposal, Whose Content Is Slightly Closer to the Soviet Proposal: A Final Attempt Will Be Made at Today's Continued Meeting</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Paris Broadcast: The third meeting of the three foreign ministers today, that is, the last meeting, is about to be held. The split between the British and Soviet groups is almost unavoidable because the opinions of the British and Soviets on the implementation of the Marshall Plan are extremely different. The meeting place is still the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Bevin arrived first, with a beaming smile. A minute later, Molotov also arrived, very serious. Molotov originally had seven advisors accompanying him, but today there were only three. News also said: The Foreign Ministers' Conference ended after discussing it for an hour and forty minutes today. Molotov walked out of the French Foreign Ministry. Judging from the situation, the meeting was almost a complete failure. Bevin also left the venue nine minutes after Molotov walked out of the venue. When reporters asked if the meeting was over, Bevin replied, "Not yet." According to official news, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will still be held tomorrow.</p>
<p>News also said: At today's Foreign Ministers' Conference, Bidault had a new proposal. According to Molotov, this new proposal has nothing special, but he is willing to consider it.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] Paris Broadcast, 1st: The Foreign Ministers' Conference was saved from breaking down today because of the French compromise plan. The French Foreign Minister's compromise plan has two points that are different from before. (1) In some respects, it is similar to Molotov's proposal yesterday. (2) The investigation of European production will never interfere in the internal affairs of member states or infringe on their sovereignty.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 30th Dispatch] Bidault and Molotov held their third meeting this afternoon, which lasted for three hours. According to reliable sources, the Three Powers Conference is expected to end on Tuesday without reaching an agreement. Reliable sources said: At today's meeting, Bevin gave a summary of the suggestions of various agencies implementing the Marshall Plan, and Molotov also put forward counter-suggestions, the content of which was not much different from Molotov's opinions put forward at the previous meeting. The three foreign ministers will continue to meet on Tuesday, at which time Molotov may make another statement, but the general public feels tonight that the meeting has actually ended. At present, the three foreign ministers no longer have the opportunity to agree on a common economic plan. Bevin's plan outlined today stipulates the establishment of an integrated committee to draft a European recovery plan for the next four years. In addition, it also advocates the establishment of four special committees to study coal, steel, grain, and vocational issues, and submit reports before August 15. All European countries except Spain will be asked for their opinions. However, the number of members of each committee will be limited. For example, the members of the integrated committee will be composed of the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and at most four other countries.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Paris 30th Dispatch] Qualified observers here recently said that after British Foreign Secretary Bevin clarified the United Kingdom's views on the Marshall Plan for economic assistance to Europe today, the positions of Britain and France have become more similar, but Austria and the Soviet Union are far apart. Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Minister Bidault both emphasized that European countries must cooperate in drafting this recovery plan, otherwise it will be difficult to obtain practical assistance from the US government or Congress. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov strongly stated that there is no need for such measures, and it is enough to set up an intelligence agency to collect information on the needs of various European countries. He also said that the Soviet government does not object to the establishment of a central agency to form a technical committee to be responsible for investigating the needs of various European countries as the basis for the assistance plan, but it must not go beyond the scope of this task, because the main purpose is only to request assistance and obtain US dollars, so there is no need to draft a similar pan-European plan. Foreign Secretary Bevin believes that Molotov's suggestion is tantamount to asking the United States for a ""blank check"", and the result will undoubtedly be rejected.</p>
<h3>If the Soviet Union Refuses to Participate in European Reconstruction, the United States Will Not Change Its Plan: Future Progress Will Be Made by Britain and France Alone</h3>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall has received a formal report on the Paris European Recovery Conference, which stated that the Soviet Union may withdraw from the conference, but Marshal has not commented on this. It is also learned that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan does not seem to cause any major changes in the US government.</p>
<p>[United Press International Paris, 1st] The Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is likely to end in complete failure. In view of the fact that Europe will inevitably be divided into two economic groups, the Soviet-controlled and Western European, Britain and France are now stepping up contact with various Western European countries to prepare the Marshall Plan. Britain and France may come forward to invite all countries willing to participate in the Marshall Plan. According to diplomatic sources, Britain and France will set September 1 as the deadline for submitting the entire plan to the United States. The so-called Western European group suggested by diplomatic circles should include the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, and western Germany. Whether the Nordic countries will join the Western European group is uncertain due to their close ties with the Soviet Union in terms of geography and economy. Whether Portugal will participate is also uncertain. As for Spain, France has excluded it. And Poland and Yugoslavia believe that when the Soviet Union refuses to participate, they will also withdraw their request to participate.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to the United States: No Comment on the Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 30th] British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel, met with US Secretary of State Marshall this morning to discuss the progress of the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. He told the press afterwards: We are pessimistic about the progress of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is said that I discussed the entire situation with Secretary of State Marshall. It is better for us to mention the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference less. I am scheduled to leave here on July 2 and return to London, where I will stay for a few weeks and will ask the government authorities for instructions. According to the authorities here, the British Ambassador to the United States is constantly informing the US government of the developments of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The US has not sent formal observers to attend this conference.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Cancels News Blackout Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press International Paris, 30th] The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has only now lifted the veil of secrecy since it began last Friday. This is because the Soviet TASS news agency has violated the secrecy agreement twice, so it was decided to cancel it.</p>
<h3>US Foreign Aid Is Not Limited to Europe</h3>
<p>Commerce Secretary Harriman Tells Reporters</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 30th] Commerce Secretary Harriman recently told the press: The world today needs US assistance, and it is not limited to Europe. The United States has responsibilities to Japan, Korea, and other countries. We should consider the money and materials needed for European reconstruction with a sympathetic attitude. Only Congress can decide whether to give them. The National Advisory Committee headed by Treasury Secretary Snyder has no different opinions on Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid Europe. Harriman will visit Germany with Secretary of Agriculture Anderson and return to the United States around mid-July.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Surplus of $750 Million</h3>
<p>[United Press International Washington, 30th] The US government today announced the national treasury situation, with revenues of $42.25 billion and expenditures of $41.75 billion, resulting in a surplus of $750 million. This is the first surplus in 17 years.</p>
<h3>Soviet Opposition to Anglo-French Proposals, Saying They May Interfere in Internal Affairs of Small Countries, Advocates Setting Up an Assistance Committee to Seek American Aid</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] TASS today accused Britain and France of attempting to control other European countries through the composite committee proposed by Bevin and Bidault. Britain and France want to use this implementing body for the Marshall Plan to make the economies of European countries suitable for the needs of Britain and France and the requirements put forward by the United States. TASS said that the Soviet Union's plan would not allow strong countries the possibility of interfering in the internal affairs of small countries. The proposals of Bevin and Bidault are intended to make small countries bear the cost of solving the economic difficulties of Britain and France themselves. American loans will be used as bait to coerce small countries. In this regard, the policies of Britain and France are similar to those of the United States. Recently, some people have strongly stated that the pan-European economic plan proposed by Britain and France does not interfere in the affairs of small countries and will not affect their sovereignty, but the facts show the opposite of these statements.</p>
<p>The recent agreement between Greece and the United States has been published. The first sentence of the agreement includes phrases such as acknowledging Greek sovereignty as examples, but after the agreement was established, Greece's sovereignty was violated. Another example is the US loan to Austria, which made Austria a vassal of the US supervisors. All of this is sufficient to explain why the Soviet delegation did not approve of the proposals made by Britain and France regarding the implementation of the Marshall Plan. Bevin's proposal is similar to France's plan, emphasizing the establishment of a composite committee to draft a European reconstruction plan for the next four years and to harmonize the needs of European countries. At the same time, it is proposed that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union initiate the drafting of a large-scale economic plan for the whole of Europe, which will then be submitted to the United States for consideration. The meaning of this move is certainly not to place the economies of Britain and France under the control of other European countries. Its intention is obviously to adjust the economies of other European countries through the composite committee to make them suitable for the needs of Britain and France themselves and the requirements put forward by the United States. The Soviet Union's proposal is to establish an assistance committee composed of the three powers and several other small countries to investigate the needs of European countries and help them obtain American aid. This plan eliminates the possibility of strong countries interfering in the internal affairs of small countries.</p>
<h3>British Imperial Conference to Discuss Military Equipment to Convene Next Monday in London</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] Representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Southern Rhodesia are scheduled to hold a meeting in London from July 7th to 26th to discuss the issue of military equipment. A similar conference was held once after the war, based on wartime experience, to discuss improvements in equipment, clothing, and so on, to suit climatic and strategic needs. The theme of this discussion will be to increase the establishment of tropical and cold-region test stations in various parts of the Empire. There is already a tropical tactical test station in Lagos, West Africa, and an Arctic tactical test station in Churchill, Canada. This meeting will not be open to the public.</p>
<h3>On the Issue of International Military Strength, I Agree with the British Proposal, Soviet Representative Opposes Immediately Proposing Definite Figures</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] Regarding the estimation of the strength of international armed forces, the figures presented by the five powers to the United Nations Security Council are different. The Chinese representative did not present a figure, but said that in principle, he agreed with the British proposal. The Soviet representative said that due to the urgency of time, he was unable to present a figure.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] The United Nations Security Council met today to discuss the issue of the strength of international armed forces. Soviet representative Gromyko vehemently attacked the US proposal advocating 20 army divisions and 4,000 aircraft, saying that this important issue could not be decided in three or four hours of discussion, and therefore, he proposed that the United Nations Military Staff Committee formally submit recommendations. The strength proposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is listed as follows: (A) French proposal for the strength of the international fleet includes the following forces: (1) Air Force - 775 bombers, 300 fighters, 200 reconnaissance aircraft; (2) Army - 6 divisions, of which 3 divisions are armored vehicle units, 3 divisions are parachute units, and 10 divisions are motorized units or cavalry; (3) Navy - 9 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 9 cruisers, 18 to 24 destroyers, 30 escort ships, 30 minesweepers, 12 submarines. (B) The British plan includes the following forces: (1) Air Force - 600 bombers, 400 fighters, 200 other aircraft; (2) Army - 8 to 12 divisions; (3) Navy - 2 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 6 cruisers, 24 destroyers, 48 escort ships, 24 minesweepers, 12 submarines.

<h3>Japanese New Diet Reconvenes Yesterday, Katayama Requests Early Treaty Conclusion and Hopes for Economic Assistance from Allied Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] Prime Minister Katayama addressed the House of Representatives on the morning of the 1st, requesting an early signing of the peace treaty with Japan, and said that Japan does not need territory, but needs the spirit and economic assistance of the Allied nations to revitalize Japan. The Japanese people have been demilitarized and are victoriously heading towards the road of civil life. The Japanese people hope that Japan will join the United Nations as soon as possible and devote itself to the permanent peace of the world. Katayama believes that the decision of the Allied Headquarters to reopen Japan's international private trade will help Japan's recovery and expresses his pleasure. He also said that Japan is currently facing extreme economic difficulties due to the lack of raw materials and the damage to industrial equipment. The entire Japanese nation must endure hardships and sacrifices to overcome the difficulties. Most of Katayama's speech elaborated on the difficult economic situation in Japan, so he asked the whole country to support the government's economic measures. Katayama did not mention the issue of reparations, nor did he talk about the occupation issue after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. In the past, whenever the Diet opened, the Japanese Prime Minister would first give a political speech in the House of Peers and then deliver a speech in the Lower House, but this time Katayama exceptionally delivered his speech in the House of Representatives first and is scheduled to deliver the same speech in the House of Councillors in the afternoon of the 1st.</p>
<h3>Turkey Purchases Ships from the US</h3>

<h3>Push-Button Warfare Is Not Yet Possible</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The House Appropriations Committee is currently discussing the legislation to merge the three services of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford, a naval aviation expert who served as commander of the Pacific Fleet, and Rear Admiral Parsons, an atomic energy expert, opposed the independence of the Air Force as a separate department when they testified before the committee on the 30th. Radford told the committee that the notion that the United States could be destroyed by a group of atomic bombs in a matter of hours or days is "absolutely impossible." Radford and Parsons also said that "push-button" warfare would not occur for at least five to twenty years. Once war breaks out, the carriers of airborne atomic bombs would be heavy bombers and high-speed jet aircraft.</p>
<h3>Wada Announces Economic Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Japanese Economic Stabilization Board Director-General Wada Hiroo presented a report to the Japanese Diet this afternoon, outlining the most concrete economic policy for revitalizing Japan, stating that increasing industrial production, reforming the system of production and distribution, and expanding Japan's foreign trade are the only ways to solve the country's declining economy. Wada pleaded with the Japanese people to tighten their belts and increase exports. He solemnly stated that the Japanese economy needs to increase the production of coal and other materials that can be exported. He said that the Japanese government hopes to control the distribution of raw materials and hopes that coal production will reach 30 million tons and steel production will reach 700,000 tons this year. The Japanese government expects that cotton yarn exports in 1947 will be twice as much as in previous years. He denounced the flow of important materials into the black market and allowed raw materials to be controlled and distributed on a priority basis. He believes that the current economic crisis in Japan is caused by the following reasons: (1) a severe shortage of production, (2) urgent needs of Japanese consumers since the end of the war, (3) malignant inflation.</p>
<h3>Government Submits Written Responses to Questions on Food</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Ichiki Otsuhiko, a member of the Japanese House of Councillors, submitted seven written questions to the government regarding the production costs of rice and wheat and the smuggling of staple and non-staple foods. The government also responded in writing, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Raising the purchase price of food will increase the burden on consumers, so the purchase price cannot be determined based solely on the producer's point of view. (2) Regarding the main agricultural products such as rice and wheat, production plans should be formulated under the organic linkage of production planning, purchase ratio, and allocation ratio of production materials such as fertilizers. Legislation regarding this issue is currently under study. (3) Regarding the elimination of secret purchases, the entire nation should make efforts, but it is a prerequisite that the people can obtain the minimum amount of food, so efforts must be made to increase food production.</p>
<h3>North Korean Conference Continues</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 1st] The North Korean conference continued this afternoon at 2:00 pm at the meeting of the People's Committee in Pyongyang. US and Soviet representatives and North Korean People's Committee leaders Kim Il-sung, Kim Tu-bong, Kim Chae-geun, and Hong Ki-ju were present.

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 1st] Various groups under the North Korean professional organizations sent letters of appreciation to the US-Soviet Joint Committee through the Cultural Department of the People's Committee and unanimously recommended Kim Il-sung as the leader of the future Korean provisional government. Also, North Korean farmers competed to present gifts to the US and Soviet representatives, including silk fabrics, summer cloth, etc.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Arrives in Australia, He Does Not Believe There Will Be Another Major War</h3>
<p>[United Press, Canberra, 1st] British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery arrived in Darwin yesterday and delivered a speech, saying that he had already "tasted enough of the bitterness of war" and did not believe that there would be another major war. "We have already experienced a storm sweeping across the world, and the amazing waves it caused will take a long time to calm down." The purpose of Montgomery's visit to Australia is to discuss the defense issues of the Empire in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Lenient Policy Towards Japan Causes Deep Dissatisfaction in Britain, Believes MacArthur's Reform Plan Is Too Conservative</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that Britain is dissatisfied with some aspects of the US policy towards Japan, exacerbating the long-brewing conflict between MacArthur and other occupying countries. Official opinions cannot be ascertained at this time, but the disputes in the past few months can be briefly described as follows: (1) According to representatives of some countries, MacArthur is nominally the commander of the United Nations, but he is too independent, giving the US occupation forces a superior position and reducing foreign participation; (2) Spokesmen for Britain and the Soviet Union have repeatedly criticized MacArthur's reform plan as incomplete, too conservative, and too lenient towards some Japanese; (3) China, Britain, Australia, and other countries all said that MacArthur wanted to reduce reparations and allow Japan to maintain a higher level of industrial development. British officials in Malaya, in need of Japanese prisoners of war to restore wartime damage, opposed MacArthur's repatriation plan.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Retorts, Hailing the Achievements of the Occupation</h3>
<p>On the other hand, MacArthur has also clearly expressed impatience with international hesitation, saying that the US's dominant occupation has prevented Japan from becoming as disorganized as Germany and has curbed the communist offensive. The United States has spent money to maintain the Japanese economy, while other countries are reluctant to contribute and yet want to speak on Japanese affairs. Speed is of the essence, especially in the economy. MacArthur has repeatedly urged the Far Eastern Commission to resolve the issue of Japanese reparations and to re-determine the level of the Japanese economy, but it should be guaranteed that the Japanese can obtain sufficient food and other necessities. MacArthur's decision to allow the Japanese to hunt whales for the second time and to mine phosphate ore from Angaur Island was based on this consideration. Otherwise, the United States would have to spend more money on imports or cause internal unrest, endangering the occupation forces. Japan currently owes the United States about $300 million, and the import of necessities is rapidly increasing.</p>
<h3>Various Countries Express Particular Doubt About the Degree of Japanese Democracy</h3>
<p>MacArthur and his spokesmen have repeatedly stated that democracy will remain in Japan, but many foreign representatives and some more impartial observers do not believe so. However, MacArthur said that the occupation forces can only order some reforms, and the rest should be carried out automatically by the Japanese. In this regard, the mission of the occupation forces has actually been completed. MacArthur advocates a moderate political and economic philosophy, which is more conservative than what the Soviet Union, Britain, and Australia hope for. The spokesmen of the three countries have repeatedly stated this.</p>
<h3>Allied Headquarters Issues Statement Responding to British Protest</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] MacArthur's Headquarters issued a special statement today in response to recent protests from Britain and other countries regarding the permission granted to Japan to send whaling fleets to the Antarctic Ocean and to carry out mining operations on Angaur Island, stating that "it is clearly not true to say that this move threatens the economic or military security of any" Allied nation. As for the claim that the British and Australian governments were not consulted in advance, it is also inaccurate. The US government consulted with the relevant governments before MacArthur's Headquarters approved the project.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Banking Syndicate's Loan to Japan Rejected by Allied Headquarters Because of Excessive Interest Rate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] This reporter has just learned from the most reliable sources that an Anglo-American banking syndicate had offered a loan of £50 million to Japan, but it was rejected by the Allied Headquarters. This matter was proposed recently, and the Allied Headquarters announced its opposition a few days ago. The reason is that the interest rate is too high and other conditions are harsh. The Anglo-American banking syndicate wanted to obtain an interest rate of 3.5%, and the annual interest rate would be about 4% including other commissions. The Allied Headquarters insisted that the maximum limit should be around 2.8%. The guarantee and collateral for the loan were not discussed. According to reports, the Anglo-American banking syndicate is the most definite of all the loan proposals made by various parties, and the matter of semi-official or private US capital loans of US$1 billion to Japan is currently being discussed in Washington and Tokyo.</p>

<h3>Agreement Reached on Cabinet Formation in Indonesia, It Is Rumored That Sjahrir Will Serve as Prime Minister, US Export-Import Bank Reserves Loan to Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 1st] It has been learned that the list of the new cabinet of the Republic of Indonesia may be announced this afternoon, and all political parties have now reached an agreement on this. Former Minister of Defense Sjahrir may serve as Prime Minister, and there may be as many as three Deputy Prime Ministers. Former Prime Minister Sjahrir may be appointed as special envoy to the United Kingdom or the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 1st] According to sources from the Republic, the new cabinet will respond to the US note tonight, and the new cabinet will be a coalition government. Important positions are allocated to the four major parties, and minor positions are assigned to other parties. At the same time, former Minister of Defense Sjahrir said at a press conference that the Indonesian Republican government is willing to accept a "super-structure," which will create a transitional period until January 9, 1949. Sjahrir stated the goal of the Republican government as stipulated in the Linggadjati Agreement. He explained that the "super-structure" has nothing to do with the Dutch-Indonesian Federation.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 30th] The US Export-Import Bank said today that the bank is still earmarking a US$100 million loan to Indonesia after the situation improves. It is said that this loan was earmarked as early as September 1945, but the situation in Indonesia soon deteriorated, so it was not granted.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on Indonesian Situation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] Regarding the US note to the Republic of Indonesia, requesting Indonesia to cooperate with the Netherlands to quickly organize a provisional Indonesian government, the Manchester Guardian published an article commenting on this, saying that this move is a last-minute effort to prevent a war between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The current situation is extremely chaotic and dangerous. If Indonesia believes that the Dutch proposal is merely to make them choose between war and unconditional surrender, Indonesia will likely choose the path of war. They know that war will divide the Netherlands no less than it will divide Indonesia. Conversely, if Indonesia believes that accepting the proposal to establish a provisional government does not make it impossible to discuss divergent opinions, their attitude may be slightly compromised.</p>

<h3>French Interior Minister Announces: Inside Story of the Black Market Party Conspiracy, Two Arrested Leaders Begin Trial</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Key leaders of the "Blue Plan" rebellion conspiracy led by the right-wing French Black Market Party, including the French Gendarmerie Inspector General Jilo and the editor of the French Life Weekly, Furban, began trial here today on charges of undermining national security by recruiting armed forces and assembling criminals for robbery. At the same time, there is a new development in the "Blue Plan" conspiracy. Retired officer Lawo was arrested today on suspicion of participating in the conspiracy. Multiple light machine guns were found in the residence of Father Raulde, who was arrested by the authorities but temporarily released on bail.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Regarding the conspiracy of the French Black Market Party to overthrow the French Republic, after Interior Minister Tapoulou held a meeting with the Prime Minister, he issued a statement to the press, clarifying the conspiracy plan of the Black Market Party. It is said that the Black Market Party had planned to rely on the assistance of the armored forces of the French occupation forces in Germany to seize Paris, overthrow the Republic, and establish a political system in accordance with the Vichy government. The conspirators also planned to issue fabricated communist documents to undermine the position of the Communist Party so that the Black Market Party could appear in the guise of restoring order.</p>
<p>Extremist Right Wing Plots to Overthrow Government</p>
<p>The French government learned of the existence of the Black Market Party as early as 1946. It was formed by extreme right-wing royalists, supporters of the Vichy government, and former collaborators. Its goal was to attack the Republic by force, and then replace it with a temporary political system of an unclear nature. In March of this year, the government learned that the Black Market Party had formulated an attack plan called the "Blue Plan," which would be implemented at the end of July or August 6. The conspirators planned to first raid the Vannes Saint-Fange prison in Brittany to release a former leader of the Black Market Party (who raided the prison for killing a prisoner). After receiving the above information, the police station began an investigation. On the 24th of this month, agents were dispatched to Count Furban's residence to search and found a large number of battle orders, secret instructions, and announcements. Count Furban was also arrested. Because the evidence was conclusive, it was not easy to deny, so he directly admitted the existence of the conspiracy. Count Furban also stated during the trial that the French Gendarmerie Inspector General Jilo was also involved in the conspiracy. The police station then searched Jilo's residence yesterday and arrested him.</p>
<p>Three Instructions to Frame the Communists</p>
<p>The meeting place for the conspirators was in the residence of Mrs. Walfur (wife of the writer Walfur). The conspirators received the following three instructions: (1) Prepare a list of names, send obituaries printed with hammers and sickles to the people on the list, informing them that the Communist Party has sentenced them to death and is about to execute them. (2) Leave fabricated communist secret warnings in public places to agitate public opinion. (3) Incite riots, loot banks and farms, so that public opinion believes that this is the Communist Party's preparation to establish a communist regime by force. The "Blue Plan" conspiracy of the Black Market Party has nothing to do with the People's Unity Movement led by General de Gaulle.</p>
<h3>Laumadi Denies Cabinet Reshuffle in France</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 1st] It is rumored here that Prime Minister Laumadi will reshuffle the cabinet to avoid a political storm caused by his resignation. Mr. Xu has denied this today. According to reports, the future of the government depends on the outcome of the National Assembly's vote on the motion of confidence in the government.

<h3>First Economic Council Meeting, City-Wide Survey of Businesses to Begin Tomorrow, Strict Order to Dismantle Intercom Phones, Violators to be Detained and Punished, Measures to Restrict Warehouse Receipt Transactions to be Formulated</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Economic Council held its first meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the City Hall auditorium. Representatives from various units attended, including Yu Shuping from the Police Department, Zhang Yamin from the Garrison Command, Wang Zhaoge, Wang Guanqing, Lin Xiexin, Shen Naizheng, Shen Zude from the City Government, Li Lixia from the Central Bank, Yan Zhuang from the Jiangsu Inspectorate, Xu Yaotian and Zhang Xiwei from the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Gao Bingtai from the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, Ye Xinming from the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse, Zhang Decheng from the Food Oil Committee, Zhang Chude from the Civil Food Allocation Committee, Gu Bingyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhao Zengjue from the Public Utilities Bureau, among others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting. He reported that the significance of the shift in the work of the economic investigation team lies in the fact that the responsible and executing agencies of the past economic supervision work could not be closely linked. The establishment of the Economic Council will take the City Government as the center, and can obtain close and rapid communication with various administrative and executive agencies, which will surely increase work efficiency. It was decided at the meeting to set up five groups: Gold and Banknotes, Gauze, Food, Food Oil, and Fuel. The Gold and Banknotes group will be jointly organized by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the Police Department. Other groups will be responsible by the responsible agencies. The Textile Management Committee will pay attention to the black market situation of cotton yarn, and the Garrison Department will regularly send personnel to the market for monitoring. In terms of fuel and food, the principle is to have sufficient production and sources. The first meeting did not end until 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Reported Six Points</p>
<p>After the meeting, Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers and reported six points: (1) A city-wide inspection will be implemented starting tomorrow. Because banks and money shops often engage in illegal speculation, the Ministry of Finance will send personnel to jointly conduct a general investigation of more than 200 banks and money shops in the city with the city government. The auditing work will be carried out in groups on a rotating basis, and will be repeated continuously. Senior personnel will be selected from the police station to receive specialized training to conduct audit work. (2) It was decided that all intercom telephones in the city will be dismantled starting today. Because intercom telephones have not been legally installed, they are equivalent to privately installed radio stations, disrupting the market and fueling speculation, which is very harmful. The Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Department will carry out the dismantling separately. If there is any resistance, detention and punishment will be imposed in accordance with the law prohibiting violations. (3) Those who are engaged in business but not in their own industry, and who specialize in other industries, and engage in speculative transactions, will be strictly prohibited. The responsible agencies will investigate and the Economic Council will deal with them severely. (4) Warehouse receipt transactions will be restricted. Because buying and selling warehouse receipts has the suspicion of hoarding and manipulation, it was decided that the responsible agencies will jointly formulate effective measures and implement them earnestly. There must be a certain time limit for the time of purchasing and selling goods, and if the time is exceeded, it will be considered hoarding and will be punished. (5) The news media should immediately stop publishing black market prices for gold, U.S. dollars, and Hong Kong dollars. (6) The implementation of economic measures, in addition to the right of the responsible agencies to manage and implement them, will be uniformly handled by the City Police Department. Other agencies can only provide reports and have no right to implement them, so as to avoid abuses such as extortion and blackmail.</p>

<h3>Standard for Settlement Allowance for Conscripts is 50,000 Yuan Per Person Within the Pass</h3>

<h3>Many Problems with Rice Allocation for Poor Households, Two District Chiefs Consult with the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Tang Tian'en, District Chief of North Sichuan Road, and Wu Ying, District Chief of Ti Yan Bridge, visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to raise three points of opinion regarding the allocation of rice for poor households and requested improvements: (1) Ordinary rice bags usually weigh 160 catties, but the subsidized broken rice for poor households weighs only 156 catties per bag. Who will compensate for the missing amount? (2) It is already July, but the rice allocation for poor households in June is still nowhere in sight. (3) Because the rosters of each district have not been submitted, the Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for verifying the allocation volume of each district by the district office. Now, if each district distributes one dou for large mouths and five sheng for small mouths, how will the surplus or deficiency be handled?

<p>White Russian Immigrants from Xinjiang Seeking Refuge in Shanghai (Photo by this Newspaper)</p>
<h3>White Russians on the Xinjiang Border Forced to Flee, Traversing Half of China to Reach Shanghai, Hundreds of People Carrying the Young and Supporting the Old</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] White Russians living on the northwestern border of Xinjiang, fearing some force, have traveled long distances across half of China to seek refuge in Shanghai. According to investigations by reporters, there are now forty-two families of White Russian refugees who have arrived in this city, totaling one hundred and forty-nine people. The youngest is a two-month-old baby, and the oldest is seventy-two years old. Of these, one hundred and seventeen people are temporarily residing in the Russian Commercial School on Beidang Road with the assistance of the Russian Emigrant Association. The refugees arrived in Shanghai in three batches. The first batch arrived on May 10, totaling fifty people. The second batch arrived at the end of May, totaling thirty-five people. The last batch was larger, arriving in Shanghai in mid-July. They left Yili on October 14 of last year, first traveling by horse or on foot to Dihua, then by truck via Lanzhou to Xi'an, and then by the Longhai Jinpu Railway to Beijing and then to Shanghai. The journey was extremely difficult. According to the representative of the refugees, they have lived in Yili for a long time, some for fifteen or even twenty-five years. This time, fearing that a great disaster was imminent, they had no choice but to leave. They reluctantly abandoned most of their belongings, with only a portion of their savings as travel expenses. Along the way, in addition to the assistance of the church in Lanzhou, they also received subsidies from the provincial governments of Xinjiang and Gansu. Officials and civilians along the way treated them with friendship and sympathy, providing assistance everywhere, which is extremely appreciated. The commercial school where they are currently residing is on summer vacation, and the school provides twelve rooms of various sizes for temporary accommodation. Some have beds, while others sleep on the floor. Food is provided separately by the Russian Emigrant Association and the school. The White Russian community in this city, moved by sympathy, has generously donated many clothes and shoes, which are displayed on the stone steps in front of the school building. Although some of the refugees' children are walking barefoot, they sing and play in the setting sun, seemingly forgetting the hardships of the journey. However, neither adults nor children are interested in being photographed, because in the past, being photographed in the border areas of Xinjiang was considered a dangerous thing.</p>
<p>According to the refugees, they all have the ability to make a living and are not vagrants. They hope to find work in Shanghai to support themselves. However, it is difficult because they do not speak Chinese or English. The jobs they can do are nothing more than making leather shoes, repairing watches, carpentry, and auto repair. As of this time, some young refugees have already found work in shops and schools. Also, some of the White Russian refugees came from Yili because they were asked to accept Soviet passports, while others came from Dihua, where there is currently no danger, but they fear that it will follow the example of Yili in the future, so they also decided to move. Currently, another group of refugees, numbering about two hundred, has already reached Hami on their way to Suzhou. When asked by reporters if there were Soviet troops in Yili, the refugees replied that Soviet troops not in uniform could be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Past Life History of White Russian Refugees</p>
<p>The past life history of these refugees is inseparable from the ethnic disputes and conflicts on the Sino-Soviet border, the propaganda of the Communist Party, and the Soviet Union's attempt to control the Yili River Basin. The first people to settle in this area were the Cossacks who were defeated in the Russian Revolution, living in the Kuerjia area from 1917 to 1923. From 1929 to 1936, due to the promulgation of the new Soviet Constitution, ethnic groups dissatisfied with the status quo continued to move to Xinjiang. It is estimated that there were about 20,000 White Russians in Kuerjia and Dihua at that time, many of whom were craftsmen and technicians, and their lives were quite stable. Later, with the consent of Sheng Shicai, the power of the Soviet Union gradually invaded Xinjiang. They built airfields in the new province and established consultants in various departments of the provincial government. In 1940, the provincial government suddenly ordered refugees living in the province to produce Soviet registration certificates. At that time, the refugees deeply felt the danger of stateless people in ethnic conflicts on the border, and Soviet consultants took the opportunity to persuade them. As a result, three-quarters of the people registered, while the rest remained steadfast under any threat. By 1942, the fear of the refugees had subsided slightly because British and American consuls had arrived in Dihua and the Soviet Union was busy with the war. At that time, the Soviet Union's power in the new province seemed to be declining, and the White Russian refugees felt a little more free in spirit. In November 1944, an ethnic war broke out. According to White Russian refugees, White Russians and Soviet troops registered with the Soviet Union participated in the attack on the residence, power plant, and prison of the provincial chairman in Dihua. By 1945, the Soviet Union's control over the Yili region had been restored. At this time, White Russians were again required to register, but 200 White Russian families in Kuerjia County resolutely refused. Later, the so-called "East Turkestan Republic" was established. In September of last year, the local police began to interrogate White Russians from house to house. According to the refugees, those who had refused to register in the past were often arrested and charged with collusion with Japan. As early as 1933, a large number of White Russian officers were arrested and imprisoned until 1941, when they disappeared. Seeing that the crisis was imminent, they began to flee on a large scale. In the first five months, about 300 people fled. In January of this year, the local government prohibited residents from leaving the country. According to the latest news received by the White Russian chickens, the area has been under martial law for two months.</p>

<h3>Shenbao and Relief Hospital Continue to Jointly Offer Trachoma Screening and Treatment, The Seventh Session Will Start on July 1st, Specifically for Students</h3>
<p>The "Trachoma Prevention and Treatment Campaign" jointly organized by this newspaper and the Relief Hospital at No. 547 Xizang South Road has been held for six sessions since it started last August. More than a thousand people have applied for treatment, but general young students have often been unable to receive complete treatment according to the time specified by the hospital due to their studies. In view of this, this newspaper has specially negotiated with the hospital authorities that from July 1st, trachoma screening and treatment will be provided specifically for young students, with a quota of 150 people. All middle and elementary school students suffering from trachoma or showing signs of trachoma can apply by letter. The procedure is to first prepare a detailed application form, have it stamped by the school they are attending, and submit it directly to the department for review. If qualified, a free medical certificate will be sent. In order to avoid overcrowding, face-to-face consultations will not be accepted. It is hoped that this will be appreciated. (The eighth session will start on August 1st, with the same quota and application procedure)</p>
<h3>Reader Consulting - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) "Adopted Son" Dispute</p>
<p>Yan Yansheng asks: My friend Mr. A was adopted by adoptive parents at the age of two and raised to adulthood. Recently, he was excluded from the family tree during genealogy revision. Now I have several questions. Please answer: (1) Does a child adopted and raised by adoptive parents from infancy have the right to inherit the property of the adoptive parents? (2) Do babies from orphanages or baby care centers have legal protection with a certificate? (3) In rural customs, adopted sons are not allowed to be included in the family tree. What methods can be used to remedy this? (4) If the biological parents want to take him back, what legal methods should the adoptive parents use to prevent this? (5) If the two families merge into one, is it legally permissible? (6) If the biological parents die, can Mr. A wear mourning clothes? Is it illegal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) According to Article 1142, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, the inheritance share of an adopted child is one-half of that of a child born in marriage. However, when the adoptive parents have no lineal descendants, their inheritance share is the same as that of a child born in marriage. (2) It can only be used as proof of adoption. (3) There is no legal effect under current law. (4) Adoption of children should be based on careful consideration and can be based on the agreements made by both parties. (5) The meaning of the words is unclear and cannot be answered. (6) "Wearing mourning clothes" is a local custom and has nothing to do with the law.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing an Heir for Inheritance</p>
<p>Chuan Meizhen asks: My father passed away in 1920, leaving a considerable fortune. Later, a certain Mr. A from the clan was established as the heir and inherited two-thirds of the estate. Now I am married. I have several questions. Please answer: (1) After my mother's death, do Mr. A and his son have the right to inherit my mother's estate? (2) If Mr. A has the right to inherit, can Mr. A's inheritance share only be within one-half of the property jointly owned by my mother and me? Can that one-half be considered my personal property? (3) When I got married, my mother gave me one-half of the property as a dowry, and my mother wants to give me the other one-half after her death. After my mother's death, does Mr. A have the right to protest, requesting living expenses or a special reserved portion, and take back some of the inheritance to act as an inheritance share from my mother's gift to me or bequest? (4) If my mother uses the existing property to support my husband, after my mother's death, does Mr. A have the right to protest to my husband and take it back for his inheritance?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Mr. A has the right to inherit your mother's estate after her death (according to Article 7 of the Enforcement Law of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, the inheritance order and inheritance share of heirs established before the implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code are the same as those of children born in marriage for inheritances that begin after implementation). (2) Yes, two-thirds of his one-third can be considered the woman's property. (3) Your mother's one-half of the existing property has already been given to the woman as a dowry, and there is still one-half that can be used as Mr. A's inheritance share. (4) Legal buying and selling are of course effective, but attention must be paid to the disposition of jointly owned property, which should be with the consent of all co-owners.</p>

<h3>Horrific Tragedy at Lingnan University High School: Students Beat the Director of Academics to Death, Judge Visits School to Investigate and Orders Surveillance of Students</h3>
<p>[Report from Guangzhou on the 1st of this Month] Liu Shangzhi, Cen Mingxiao, and other representatives of senior high school students at Lingnan University High School here forced Cai Huinan, the director of academics, to publicly reveal the exam questions. When their purpose was not achieved, they severely beat Cai, who died on the evening of the 29th from serious injuries. Cai Qiu then cried and pleaded with Li Yulin, the president of Lingnan University, to pursue the murderer, comfort the family, and take care of the funeral, and also appealed to the authorities and various agencies. The Guangdong Department of Education sent personnel on the 30th to strictly investigate the truth of the incident. Cai was a Bachelor of Physics from Shanghai University and a Master of Physics from the University of the Philippines. He had taught at Lingnan University for eleven years and left behind three sons and one daughter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st] A horrific tragedy occurred here on the evening of the 28th of last month. At around 7:00 PM that evening, Cai Huipu, director of academics and chemistry teacher at Lingnan University High School, was forced by senior high school students to hand over the chemistry exam questions for the graduation exam. Cai refused to give them, and the students turned off the lights and beat him up before kicking him down from the third floor to the second floor, immediately rupturing a blood vessel in his brain. On the morning of the 29th, Cai was still unconscious and was sent to Boji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 10:00 PM that night. Cai was from Guangdong, 46 years old, with a Master of Physics from the University of the Philippines. He had served as an assistant teacher at Shanghai University and as the principal of Wuchang Bowen Middle School. He had been employed at Lingnan University High School since 1938, for nearly ten years. The judge examined the injuries and visited the school to investigate, believing that the students in the class were highly suspected and ordered the school to place the students in the class under surveillance first.</p>
<h3>Beiyang Ping Department to Start Holiday on the 7th</h3>
<p>[Report from Beiping on the 1st of this Month] The issue of the affiliation of the Beiyang Ping Department is becoming increasingly complex. The school's supporters and those who oppose Peking University's takeover have clearly divided into two factions. The current director, Chen Shoumin, and most of the professors are opposed, while most of the students are in favor of Peking University's takeover. Although Hu Shi initially wanted to take over, he has retreated in the face of this complex relationship. The department held a school affairs meeting today and has decided on the issue of the semester's curriculum under the premise of maintaining the status quo. The holiday will start on the 7th, and enrollment will begin at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Overseas Student Examination for Three Sessions to Be Suspended This Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The College Entrance Examination Board of the United States will ask the State Council to establish examination centers in major cities around the world so that overseas students can take the English exam before going to the United States. According to Liu Yingshi, acting director of the International Cultural and Educational Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, this measure is very reasonable. Chinese university students who intend to study in the United States in the future must make the most adequate preparations in English. However, the matter has not yet been made into a law in the United States, so the departure of the second batch of publicly and privately funded overseas students selected by the Ministry of Education will not be affected. According to reliable sources, the overseas student examination for the third session will be suspended this year.</p>
<h3>Jin Gongliang Returns to Beijing, Hangzhou Art Academy to Start Holiday</h3>

<p>Public School Achievement Exhibition to Be Postponed The first Public School Achievement Exhibition was originally scheduled for July 6th, according to the municipal public school calendar. However, since the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has scheduled a Far East Basic Education Conference to be held in Beijing on September 1st, and because municipal public schools have always placed great emphasis on basic education, it was decided that the best achievements from this exhibition should be sent to UNESCO for display and observation. Therefore, all public schools felt that the original exhibition date was too soon, leaving them insufficient time for preparation. A proposal was made at the 21st Municipal Public School Principals Work Discussion Meeting to postpone the exhibition, which was approved. It is now known that the Municipal Education Bureau recently notified 11 newly appointed district officers, including Bao Changping, from various public schools, that the first preparatory meeting for the first Public School Achievement Exhibition will be held at 3 PM on the 4th of this month in the Education Bureau conference room to discuss matters related to the exhibition and to determine the exhibition date. The new date will be announced in the newspaper once it has been decided.</p>
<p>East China United University to Establish Six Colleges and Twenty Departments, Enrolling New Students Separately at the End of This Month [Our Newspaper] The East China United University, formed by the merger of St. John's University, Hangzhou University, and Soochow University, has been actively preparing for several months through the board of directors and responsible persons from each school. They have now agreed on preliminary cooperative measures for the next semester, namely, jointly recruiting first-year students. It has been decided that entrance exams will be held from the 29th to the 30th of this month. Registration will begin on the 14th in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. Exam locations will also be designated in the aforementioned three cities to facilitate students taking the exam nearby. Entrance examination subjects will follow regulations from the Ministry, and will include Chinese, English, Mathematics, Civics, Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Physics and Chemistry, and Biology. The United University will be divided into six colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, Commerce, Engineering, and Medicine, which will contain the following twenty departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, Education, History, Journalism, Political Science, Economics, Sociology, Law (Law Group, Administrative Law Group, Judicial Group), Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Business Administration, Accounting, Banking, International Trade, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Architectural Engineering, and Chemical Engineering.

<p>Midwifery School Graduates' Qualifying Examination Rescheduled, Nurses School Graduates' Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination for graduates of nursing and midwifery vocational schools never stopped during the Anti-Japanese War. The Municipal Education Bureau has been actively preparing since being ordered to conduct this examination. It began on June 30th at Yucai Middle School and is scheduled to be completed on July 3rd. All nursing school graduates have participated, and the examination hall is orderly. The news of a nurses' school graduate strike reported yesterday is completely inaccurate. However, midwifery school graduates did not attend the examination because the examination subject was originally designated as "Practical Examination," but the Ministry suddenly changed it to "Bacteriology," leaving them unprepared. Xie Engao, Director of the Secondary Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau, believes that passing this examination is crucial for students to obtain practice certificates, which is significant for their future. He convened the principals of each school to discuss rescheduling the examination to rectify the situation. The schools have unanimously expressed their agreement.</p>

Following the games, military instructor Wu Xihong, Physical Education Director of the Suan Qiao Aviation School, eagerly tried to keep the visiting team, in order to hold friendly matches, but the Morning Friends team members, due to work and vacation time reasons, were unable to accept, and all 14 members of the team immediately returned to Shanghai that night.</p>
<p>Dongchang Small Ball League This Week's Schedule Rescheduled The small ball league organized by the Dongchang Sports Association has been proceeding smoothly and has been well received by the local people. However, due to continuous rain recently, it has not been possible to hold the matches. This week, in response to an invitation from the Nanhui Liutuan Sports Association, a charity match will be held to raise funds for the local epidemic hospital. Therefore, all league and exhibition matches this week have been postponed.</p>

<p>Textile Adjustment Committee to Set Up Public Warehouses in Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hankou, Cotton Yarn Allocation Will Not Be Limited [Our Newspaper] Liu Siying, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, met with reporters yesterday in the conference room of the Textile Adjustment Committee. He answered reporters' questions regarding the current textile adjustment policies. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Regarding the current policies of the Textile Adjustment Committee on cotton yarn and cloth adjustment, a joint allocation system has been established in this city. For other areas, it is planned to first set up cotton yarn and cloth public warehouses in Guangzhou and Tianjin, and Hankou is also planned. The cotton yarn in each public warehouse will be transported and sold by the Textile Adjustment Committee and manufacturers. However, manufacturers must first obtain a transport and sales permit from the Textile Adjustment Committee. After tax-paid cotton yarn is transported to various places, it will be stored centrally in the local public warehouses, which will be responsible for the joint allocation in each area. The allocation price will be based on the negotiated price of cotton yarn in Shanghai. (2) In the future, after the establishment of public warehouses in various places, the existing methods of transporting goods south and north will be virtually abolished. The number of goods transported to various places can be unlimited, depending on the needs of each area. (3) A joint export agency will also be set up for the export of cotton yarn in the future. In addition to state-owned factories providing 20% of their current production for export, it is also hoped that private factories can increase their production by 20% of their current output for joint export. (4) The Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to set up several investigation agencies in the Nanyang area to first investigate the types and styles of cotton yarn and its products needed in various parts of Nanyang to provide a reference for domestic exports. (5) Currently, 70% of the cotton yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories is 20-count yarn. At least that portion of the cotton yarn will be provided to the Textile Adjustment Committee for joint allocation. (6) Now that the cotton yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories is provided for joint allocation, the government's purchase of cotton yarn can be discontinued. (7) After the negotiated price of cotton yarn is set, the prices of other cotton yarn-replicated products also need to be negotiated based on the negotiated price of cotton yarn to determine reasonable prices. [Another Report] According to the observation of a tea and textile authority: The most important thing for the government's current cotton yarn and cloth adjustment policies is to strive for reasonable and effective allocation. Reasonable allocation is even more important than lowering yarn prices, so a joint allocation system has been created. If this system is ineffective, then entrusted spinning and weaving Jian will be considered. If this is still not enough, then production and sales registration will be carried out to implement a comprehensive system of unified purchase and unified sales. As for the purchase of cotton yarn, the government's supply of foreign exchange will likely continue. He pointed out that the government's current implementation of the joint allocation system hopes to thoroughly implement joint price negotiation and joint allocation. He hopes that all yarn factories will prioritize the welfare of the country and society and not be solely concerned with their own private interests. However, it is heard that private factories hope to jointly negotiate prices but individually allocate goods in order to maintain the business freedom of private factories. [Another Report] The head of a private factory told reporters yesterday: In order to stabilize yarn prices due to recent fluctuations in cotton yarn market prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee has temporarily agreed with various yarn factories to jointly allocate goods on a trial basis, with each state-owned and private yarn factory providing 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn to be delivered by the 15th of this month for joint allocation. The cotton yarn outside of the 10,000 pieces will still be transported and sold freely by each factory. Moreover, the 10,000 pieces provided are for a trial run and do not mean that each factory is required to provide 10,000 pieces of yarn every half month.</p>
<p>Remittances to Wuzhou and Hengyang Will Also Be Restricted Due to recent capital flight to Hong Kong and arbitrage by merchants, exchange rates in South China have fluctuated drastically. National banks have implemented austerity measures, and the Central Bank has restricted the amount of money that commercial banks can remit to Guangdong and Fujian provinces to 50 million yuan per week. After this regulation, some unscrupulous merchants have found ways to remit money to places such as Wuzhou and Hengyang, and then transfer it to Huayang in order to achieve their goals. The Central Bank is paying attention to the development of this situation and will also strictly restrict it.</p>
<p>Meeting to Discuss Shipping Qingdao Edible Oil to Shanghai Scheduled for Saturday Regarding the issue of shipping edible oil from Qingdao to Shanghai, Cao Peizi, Director of the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau, went to Beijing a few days ago to ask the relevant ministries and courtyards of the Economic, Food, and Social Affairs Departments for instructions. Cao returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and told reporters that Qingdao produces more than 3,000 tons of edible oil per month, with soybean oil being the main product. Local consumption only requires about 60 tons per month. If transportation difficulties can be resolved and a fixed quantity can be shipped out on schedule, it will be enough to curb the current rise in edible</p>

<p>E. Zola, translated by Bi Xiushao</p>
<p>The blacksmith was a large man, the largest in the area, with strong shoulders, and a face and arms tanned by the flames of the forge and the iron dust from the hammer. Beneath his square skull and thick hair, he had large, green, childlike eyes that sparkled like steel. His wide jaw exuded laughter and snoring breath, as immense and joyful as the giant breathing from his bellows; though he was fifty years old, when he raised his arms with a satisfied and powerful posture—a habit he had acquired from his usual blacksmithing—he seemed even more energetic than a youth, using his "Miss," a twenty-five-pound hammer, which he alone could wield from Vernon to Tonon, a terrifying tool.</p>
<p>I lived in the blacksmith's house for a full year, a year of convalescence.</p>
<p>My heart was restless, my mind was confused, I went out, walking forward, searching for myself, searching for a peaceful and working corner where I could regain my strength. One afternoon, after crossing the village, I glimpsed a blacksmith shop, isolated and full of red light, lying across the four-way intersection. The firelight was so radiant that it shot out from the wide-open carriage door, making the crossroads glow with a fire-like red, and causing the poplars lined up along the river opposite to emit a dazzling light like torches. In the distance, in the soft twilight, the rhythmic hammering sounded miles away, like an approaching iron army running across the wilderness. There, under the wide-open door, in the light of the forge and the thunderous vibrations and noise, I stopped, watching the work, watching these hands on the red-hot iron rods, twisting and smoothing them, I already felt very happy and had gained great spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>On this autumn evening, I first saw the blacksmith forging a plow. His shirt was open, revealing his thick chest. His sides, with each breath, revealed steel-like muscles. He leaned back, assuming an attacking posture, and struck down his hammer. In this way, he continued his work uninterrupted, with the soft movements of his body and the firm strength of his muscles. The iron rod rotated in a regular circle, bringing many sparks and leaving a kind of flash behind it. What the blacksmith was wielding with both hands was "Miss." As for his son, a lively young man of twenty, he used tongs to hold the burning red iron and also struck the iron with his hammer, making dull sounds, but ultimately unable to match the loud dance of the old man's terrifying "Miss." Dok, dok—dok, dok, people thought it was a mother's solemn voice encouraging her child's first words. "Miss" was still "waltzing," shaking the shining iron stones on her dance dress, letting her heels imprint on the red plowshare. Each time she jumped heavily on the anvil, she changed the shape of the iron under her feet. A blood-like flame flowed all the way to the ground, illuminating the protruding cheekbones of the two workers, their huge shadows stretching across the dark and blurred corners of the forge. Gradually, the red light faded, and the blacksmith stopped. He stood darkly, leaning on the handle of the hammer, sweat streaming down his forehead, but he did not wipe it away. In the roar of the bellows, which his son slowly pumped by hand, I heard the breathing of his still-shaking chest. That night, I slept in the blacksmith's house, and I never left here again. I had an empty room upstairs above the forge, provided by him and which I was happy to accept. From five o'clock in the morning, when the sky was not yet bright, I participated in my master's work. I was awakened by the sounds of the whole house, this joyful and happy sound, which continued until night. Below me, the hammer was dancing. "Miss" continuously knocked on the ceiling under my feet, as if calling me to get up, regarding me as a lazy person. The whole poor room, its large wardrobe, its white wooden table, its two chairs, all creaked, as if urging me to get dressed quickly. I had to go downstairs. Downstairs, I saw that the forge was already red. The bellows roared, blue and rose-colored flames rising from the coal, and spherical bodies of stars shone under the gusts of the charcoal fire. However, the blacksmith was preparing for his day's work. He moved the raw material in the corner, surrounded the plow, and checked the wheels. When he saw me, he immediately put his fists on his waist, this respectable man, he smiled, his mouth stretching all the way to his ears. Getting me out of bed at five o'clock seemed to make him happy. He believed he was striking for the sake of striking, awakening everyone early in the morning with the terrifying ensemble of his hammer. He put his huge hand on my shoulder, he leaned over and spoke to me as if speaking to a child, saying that since I had lived among his scrap iron, my body had become healthier. Every day, we drank white wine together at the back of an overturned old car.</p>
<p>Then, I lived in the forge, spending my day there. Especially in the winter when it rained, I lived there all day. I became interested in the work of the forge. The blacksmith's continuous struggle of hammering the raw iron that he arbitrarily changed and modified finally moved me like a powerful tragedy. I watched the metal from the furnace to the anvil, I watched it bend, stretch, and roll like soft wax under the worker's victorious efforts, and I couldn't help but feel surprised by this exquisite craftsmanship. When the plow was finished, I knelt in front of it. I no longer remembered the rough appearance of the unfinished product the night before. I examined the parts. I dreamed, I thought that supremely powerful fingers had cast it so wonderfully, and did not need the assistance of fire. Sometimes, I smiled, I thought of a young girl I had seen before, across from my window, using her slender hands to twist brass wire, and using a silk thread to tie artificial violets onto these copper wires.</p>
<p>The blacksmith never sighed. I had seen him, after hammering iron for fourteen hours during the day, laughing happily at night and scrubbing his arms with a satisfied attitude. He never worried, never got tired. He could support his house with his shoulders, if his house were about to collapse. In winter, he said it was warm in his forge. In summer, he left the doors wide open so that the smell of hay could come in. When summer came and the sun was about to set, I went to the door and sat beside him. We were halfway up the mountain; from there we could see the wide area of the valley. He silently observed this infinitely large, green felt-like cultivated land, disappearing into the twilight purple horizon, and felt very happy.</p>
<p>The blacksmith often joked. He said that all this land belonged to him, and his forge had been supplying plows to the entire surrounding area for more than two hundred years. This was his pride. Without him, there would be no abundant harvests. The reason why the plains were green in May and yellow in July, and why they had this velvet-like changing appearance, was entirely due to his efforts. He loved the crops in the fields as much as his own daughter. When the sun was good, he was happy. When it hailed, he raised his fists against the black clouds on the horizon. Often, he pointed out to me a piece of land in the distance that looked no bigger than the back of a coat, and he told me that in a certain year, he had made a plow for that square field of buckwheat or barley. When the planting season came, he sometimes set aside his hammer. He went to the side of the road, put his hands on his legs, and watched the emerging seedlings in front of him. He watched many plows from his family go deep into the soil, turning over their furrows on the left or right of the opposite side. The valley was filled with his products. To see the plowing horses moving slowly forward, one could almost say that it was many armies marching. The plowshares sparkled in the sun with a silver-like reflection. He raised his arm, he called me, he wanted me to see how "sacred" a task they were doing.</p>
<p>All this brilliant ironware sounding under my feet filled my blood with steel. This was more valuable than any medicine in the pharmacy. I got used to this disturbing sound, I needed this music of the hammer hitting the anvil to hear my own life. In my entire room, agitated by the roar of the bellows, I had rediscovered my poor mind. Dok, dok—dok, dok, this was simply the happy pendulum that regulated my working hours. When the work was most intense and the blacksmith was angry, I heard the red iron creaking under the devilish hammer, and I had a giant-like heat in the palms of my hands, and I wanted to flatten the whole world with the tip of my pen. Then, when the forge was silent, there was also complete silence in my mind; I went downstairs, saw this conquered metal that was still smoking, and I felt ashamed of my work.</p>
<p>Ah! Sometimes, on hot afternoons, I saw how majestic the blacksmith was! He was naked to the waist, his protruding and tense muscles, like a colossus of Michelangelo, expressing supreme power. Watching him, I discovered the lines of modern sculpture, which our artists laboriously seek in the dead flesh of Greece. In my eyes, he seemed to be the great hero of labor, the tireless descendant of this century, who constantly forged our tools of analysis on the anvil, and used iron and fire to create our future society. He made his hammer his toy. When he wanted to laugh, he picked up his "Miss" and quickly struck the anvil. So he filled his whole family with thunderous sounds in the rose-colored breath of the furnace. I thought I heard the groans of the working people.</p>
<p>It was there, in the forge full of plows, that I was forever cured of my laziness and doubt.</p>
<h3>Zola's Social Justice</h3>
<p>Whenever French realism is mentioned, people only think of Flaubert and Maupassant. In fact, Zola was the master of this aspect. Zola's method was the most unique and radical method of French realism in the nineteenth century. He captured all social phenomena with deep observation. Romanticists slightly touched on the petty bourgeoisie and the lower classes in addition to depicting heroes and beauties, while Zola used the greatest energy to depict them. In order to find what he wanted to depict, he once went deep into the lower classes and wrote biographies for prostitutes. He wanted to accuse everything of oppressed souls.</p>
<p>When the famous Dreyfus affair occurred, Zola was angered by social justice, and he did not hesitate to launch a fierce attack at any sacrifice.</p>
<p>The facts were as follows: Dreyfus, a Jew, was arrested and imprisoned for allegedly leaking military secrets during the war. But in fact, he was innocent. The real criminal was later discovered. However, ordinary French people and militarists with racial prejudices still refused to overturn Dreyfus's verdict and even sentenced him to exile. Zola could not tolerate such injustice, so he published the famous open letter "I Accuse" in the newspaper to impeach the illegal actions of the military authorities. At the same time, he distributed many pamphlets to arouse the attention of the national opinion circles. The French opinion circles were indeed stirred up by this. Those who supported Zola included literary giants France, Mirbeau, Clemenceau, and Jaurès, who was later assassinated for opposing the European War. The other faction added a bad name to Zola, scolding Zola as a traitor and suing him for false accusation.</p>
<p>On February 12, 1898, Zola had to be judged by the court. When Zola arrived at the court, he was still angry and willing to guarantee Dreyfus's innocence with his life and reputation.</p>
<p>However, the court, which had no justice at all, finally sentenced Zola to one year in prison and a fine of three thousand francs. Zola had to leave England and live a life of escape for one year.</p>
<p>Zola ruthlessly exposed the darkness of society and resisted all unjust acts. Now, let's study what kind of position Zola took as his own position in exposing the various phases of the dark side. We can see from the above facts. He was a social justice fighter who did not hesitate to fight against the autocratic politics of great-power chauvinism. Although he was criticized by public opinion and judged by law, his anger was always vented towards the evil exploiters. However, this was only a sense of justice, and his position was only limited to this.</p>
<p>He said: "...If this continues, France will inevitably be led to destruction. If we want to improve society, we must start with improving families." From these words, we can see Zola's true face.</p>
<p>At present, we still need this kind of social justice, but we hope that our writers can also express and uphold justice like Zola. Purple Wisteria Cuckoo, Lingxu Village Sketches, Gao Luan</p>
<p>Night Owl</p>
<p>The first night I slept in a small village surrounded by clear blue streams, and fantasy made me feel boundless horror and trembling. The night was pitch black, and the earth seemed to have died for countless years. I curled up on the bed, deeply regretting that I shouldn't have blown out the vegetable oil lamp that reflected a faint yellow light, and that I shouldn't have carefully bolted the bamboo door of the thatched cottage. Usually, I don't believe that those ethereal water goblins and tree spirits will grab people, but when it comes to this "May in the countryside, no one breaks in," like the defeated soldiers retreating on the firing line, and the hunters closely chasing the deer, timidity firmly entangles the ancient cypress like a long-lasting ivy. The miserable howling of the night owl and the chattering of fish made me have no strength, even a little bit, to resist its threat.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a kind of abnormal psychology, but in the deep night of that water village, those night owls that usually live on the big camphor trees by the stream always let out sharp howls like those of criminals about to be executed. The superstitious color in the countryside is particularly strong. As long as you associate it a little, the gloomy ghosts seem to really exist in the world. It's not that I believe in "ghosts," but in reality, the howling of the night owl is indeed a bit too mournful...</p>
<p>Gunfire</p>
<p>It's quite interesting to talk with those innocent and sincere farmers under the moonlight. One evening, we were "telling jokes" when suddenly that guy's voice seeped in from a field of croaking frogs. Speaking of that "guy," everyone had to be apprehensive. The surrounding villages have not been peaceful recently, and the faint sound of gunfire can often be heard in the breeze from afar. Farmers don't have the talent to express their feelings, so silence is their only way. I looked at the crescent moon in the sky hooking on the blue background, and I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy in my heart. After a while, dog barks mixed with noisy voices and crying. The shimmering night light was reflected in the far and near paddy fields, and I understood the "blood" and "tears" of the farmers. Old Wei said: "Robbers were originally farmers who couldn't survive." One robbery after another, I was really afraid that the gentle water village would become a world of bandits.</p>
<p>Morning Mist</p>
<p>In the morning there was a heavy fog. Looking at the mountains, rivers, grass, and trees on the opposite bank from a distance, they were all blurred as if some omnipotent being had draped them with a light and delicate gauze. The morning mist here is very charming. All the mountains are submerged in a white mist. The cattle, sheep, and village houses make people suspect that this is a scene in a fairy tale. Ying was washing clothes by the stream under the thick shade, and I stood beside her, facing such a misty stream and mountains, I couldn't help but let the steed of my memories of the past run wild: the past was as hazy as the mist, which blurred my eyes. There were my sorrows and desires, my joys. The colors of the past were complicated. It was dyed with my infinite "colors of life." I had love and hate, laughter and tears. The fog of life, the life of fog, but it has never been as beautiful as the misty scenery of the water village. Ying was probably also moved by this "fog," and she looked back and smiled at me!</p>
<p>Don't stay in the wind and fog any longer. In a little while, the sun will come out. The scenery is certainly not as charming as it is now, but it is still relatively bright, decent, and formal. Old Tree, Xuan Jianren</p>
<p>Old tree, the sweet home of blackbirds.</p>
<p>I don't know its date of birth, nor do I know how many springs, summers, autumns, and winters it has survived. But its trunk gives me a feeling of old age; when I push open the window and look into the distance, its green leaves give me a sense of beauty. When the wind comes, it gives me a signal, whether it is morning or night.</p>
<p>As soon as the sun comes out of the mountain, the melodious songs of the golden oriole gently knock on the door of my dreams. I turned over, fatigue still entangled me, and I didn't want to get up. Listen, listen to this beautiful song. The magpies, not willing to be outdone, also opened their throats to sing, as if competing for the championship. Only the clumsy singers of the sparrows make people feel uncomfortable; this symphony is so discordant, but it is youthful.</p>
<p>On the branches of the old tree, birds have built many nests, adorning its beauty.</p>

<p>Mr. W was very anxious about this matter, so he asked me and Tsurumi to go upstairs for a confidential discussion. This was on the afternoon of the fourth. At that time, Tsurumi seemed to be at a loss, because these three unsatisfactory things were closely related to him. At the same time, he had to leave that night; Matsui had arranged two routes for him to return to his country; one, to take a military transport ship from Tianjin, which would reach Tokyo in 24 hours; two, to take a military plane to Shenyang, transfer to Busan, and fly to Tokyo, which would take a shorter time.</p>
<p>We discussed for an hour, and finally decided that I would take the stage to sing this big final piece; first go to Tianjin, use the "No. 15" method, and carry out activities at the Japanese military headquarters. At the same time, Mr. W arranged for those in the Tianjin anti-espionage organization who had not been poisoned to find a way to contact me and risk rescuing Yaoqun and the detained comrades.</p>
<p>Because Tsurumi had to go to Shenyang to make some arrangements, he decided to take the second route arranged for him by Matsui. Before parting, he held my hand tightly:</p>
<p>Brother Yiyue, the matter of relocating the headquarters to Shanxi will be decided after I send a letter from Tokyo. In any case, the headquarters matter must be entrusted to you, old brother!... Regarding the Tianjin matter, Yaoqun and Little Tiger, and the matter of the comrades in this area, also have to be entrusted to you, old brother!... And the matter here (referring to Mr. W's headquarters in Beiping), there may not be any big trouble recently; if there is trouble, you, old brother, will have to worry and "help out" a bit; this also has to be entrusted to you, old brother!"</p>
<p>There are a total of three "entrustments" here; the first two entrustments are considered to be under my name, so even if he didn't entrust them, since I had taken on this mission, I had to do my best. But what file is this third entrustment about? The two words "help out," because his Mandarin was not thorough after all, may be a misuse of "help"; but how could it be entrusted to me? Mr. W's brain and skills are many dozens of hundreds of times better than mine. Who am I? Why also "entrust" it to me?</p>
<p>Finally, he grabbed my hand again, adding a bit of strength, and shook it hard a few times: "This time I go to Tokyo, my 'life and death are uncertain.' Regarding Pingzi's matter, I don't know what kind of magic it is, and I can't guess it either. I can only try my luck. If it goes well, of course, everything will be fine; Pingzi is a good hand and should be used as much as possible. If it doesn't go well, the matter of our twelve secret stations also has to be entrusted to you, old brother!" Saying this, he gradually lowered his head.</p>
<p>These four "entrustments" have a strong meaning of "entrusting posthumous affairs." While reluctantly agreeing, I also felt very apprehensive.</p>
<p>After entrusting me, he gave Mr. W the same four entrustments, only the third item changed its wording. A person in his twenties, who had always been open-minded, suddenly became so long-winded. Tsurumi's mood at this time was imaginable, as if he had suddenly lost his basis, and he couldn't help but feel a little sad and absent-minded.</p>
<p>After Tsurumi left, Mr. W and I reviewed the program we had just discussed again. Because the matter was of great importance, we had to be so careful. Under review, we carefully considered the "No. 15" method to see if it could be applied smoothly and whether there would be any future troubles.</p>
<p>What is called "No. 15"? This is not a new invention of Tsurumi and mine. Ordinary international top-level intelligence field agents all have this method of operation. However, it was Tsurumi's creation to mechanize these methods and list them as numbers; there are endless conveniences. (The highest special field agent, that is, an international spy, is "single-line," and does not have relations with other field agents, and is only commanded by the headquarters.)</p>
<p>I remember that in the past, in German Major Buto's "Memoirs of the European War," he described how the third Prince Wilhelm of the German Emperor went to the United States incognito and mingled among dock workers, specializing in setting fires in military industrial raw material stacks using chemical methods. Several large stacks burned spontaneously in the middle of the night for no reason. The losses in the United States were very heavy. (This style of work is single-line, although there are stipulated targets, it has the right to act independently and does not contact other spies).</p>
<p>Later, this mysterious prince who set the fire was detected by top-level agents of the US intelligence department, and the prince, who was bedridden, was also captured. At that time, a former German diplomat stationed in the United States came forward in Switzerland to negotiate, willing to exchange four American generals captured by Germany. The US State Department originally intended to agree, but the intelligence department firmly refused.</p>
<p>C returned from Germany. He had been away from his motherland for more than ten years in a hurry. The world is changing, white clouds turn into gray dogs. Especially in these ten years of the most intense turmoil, one can't help but feel the vicissitudes of life.</p>
<p>In the first two days of arriving in Shanghai, many jokes came out. What francs, gold pounds, US dollars, legal tender; just the currency system problem, Dubo Mantan, Wang Cong</p>
<p>made this great doctor who was proficient in both Chinese and Western cultures have a headache. I suddenly remembered the two sentences "Cars share the same tracks, and books use the same script," thinking about the divided situation in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Qin Shihuang's "unification of cars and books" was really a miraculous achievement in history.</p>
<p>One day, Sister C and I took a public bus, and Sister C rushed to buy tickets. Her expression was like she was hosting a big feast.</p>
<p>"Did you really come from Germany? Or from the countryside?" Obviously, my words were full of sarcasm.</p>
<p>Sister C smiled. After a while, she solemnly asked me; "Are the bus tickets very expensive now? Are they hundreds of thousands?"</p>
<p>This sentence may make the Shanghai citizens of June in the 35th year of the Republic of China laugh, but if the current prices were predicted to a friend ten years ago, wouldn't they also find it absurd? It's simply unbelievable, with 500,000 yuan for one load of rice, wouldn't everyone starve to death? But, strangely, we haven't starved to death yet. Amen! Free Talk Biographies, Jiang Tingfu's Comeback, Ping Qi</p>
<p>On the evening of October 8 last year, a rather enthusiastic cocktail party was held at the Yiyuan Hotel. The host was all the staff of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA), and the reason for holding the cocktail party was to bid farewell to Mr. Jiang Tingfu, the director of the RRA who had just resigned.</p>
<p>At that time, three universities in the United States telegraphed inviting Mr. Jiang to teach; Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, and Mei Yiqi, the president of Tsinghua University, also rushed to telegraph him to recruit him. However, Mr. Jiang told me: he decided to rest for two months first, no matter what.</p>
<p>Recently, the United Nations Far East Economic Conference was held in Shanghai. Among the delegations from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, most were people related to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)—such as Ms. Hinde from Britain, Kirkpatrick from the United States, and Semynas from the Soviet Union. However, unexpectedly, the name of Huo Baoshu, the current director of the RRA, was not in the Chinese delegation. Instead, Jiang Tingfu made a comeback after eight months of silence, serving as the chief representative of China, and was elected as the chairman of the conference by an overwhelming majority.</p>
<p>Jiang's comeback was not accidental. In fact, the atmosphere at this conference was quite tense, and the handling was quite tricky. The Soviet representative, following their style in all international conferences, always made eccentric statements, even showing poor diplomatic courtesy and cultivation. And there came an Indian representative who echoed him, speaking especially often and being particularly combative. The Filipino representative, who once presided over the conference as vice-chairman, was somewhat in a dilemma—but under Jiang's chairmanship, everything proceeded very smoothly, and all the dangerous waves on the conference were finally able to be safely overcome.</p>
<p>Handling this kind of conference, even a slight mistake would damage the face of the entire country. But Jiang possessed all the conditions for handling this kind of conference: first, he had魄力 (poqi - courage and decisiveness); second, he had resolution; third, his historical cultivation enabled him to quickly summarize several key points after analyzing the problems in detail. Often, others spoke for a long time, but he only needed two or three sentences to impartially include all the main points; fourth, it was his reputation—although his work during his tenure in the RRA caused some dissatisfaction in some areas in China, his spirit of "staying if we agree, leaving if we disagree" only created a higher reputation internationally.</p>
<p>However, Jiang also possessed two extremely superior conditions, and these two conditions will inevitably enable him to have more brilliant achievements in the future: the first condition is: he is a person who is proficient in the situation in the Soviet Union. In the early days of the war, he estimated that the Soviet Union would not use force against Japan. Although he was attacked by many so-called "pro-Soviet people" at the time, the results proved that his views were correct. The second condition is: he is also a person who truly understands the United States. His estimate of the United States is also as accurate as his estimate of the Soviet Union. During his tenure in the RRA, American newspapers praised him almost unanimously, and his achievements in the Far East Economic Conference this time won countless praises again. Regardless of whether China is willing to become a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future—people like Jiang Tingfu should not be "frozen" again. Anecdotes of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, Ji Ming</p>
<p>My late maternal grandfather once had a framed work of calligraphy by Hongwu, which was inscribed with twelve characters: "Shao Kangjie deduced the Book of Changes, I cherish it very much," the strokes were ancient and clumsy, even Zhong and Wang could not surpass it. According to the Zhu family, he was the second commoner revolutionary in our country. He lacked education in his childhood and became a monk when he grew up. His lack of learning and contempt for Confucian scholars were the same as those of Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty. The slightly different thing was that the assistants of Emperor Gaozu were mostly Zhang Liang's words of Huang Lao, and Xiao He's emphasis on pen and ink, with no Confucian scholars who lived up to their name. But the people around Zhu were mostly people like Song Lian and Liu Qun, who subtly taught him Confucianism. Therefore, when he was the King of Wu, he was able to draft rescue orders himself, as well as refute memorials. Moreover, when the mood struck, his poems and lyrics were also worth seeing. "Yu Chu Xu Zhi" recorded: When Emperor Taizu went to Jiangnan to conscript troops, he went to a certain temple, looked around the corridors and porches, and was arrogantly complacent. The monks in the temple then took out the donation book and asked him to inscribe it. Emperor Taizu did not answer, but they insisted on asking him to do so, so he wrote a quatrain on the wall, saying: "Kill all the million soldiers in Jiangnan, the precious sword at my waist is still stained with blood, the monks in the mountains do not know the wise master, they only care about asking my name." The monks in the temple were greatly frightened. After he left, they washed it off with water. When he ascended the throne, he ordered people to go and see it, but the inscription from the past was no longer there. The emperor was furious and detained all the monks in the temple, planning to put them in jail. One of the monks was also good at poetry, so he reported: "I dared not keep the imperial pen's poem, I was always afraid that ghosts and gods would be worried when I kept it, so I gently washed it with holy water, and there was still a ray of light shooting into the Big Dipper." The emperor turned his anger into joy, so he pardoned all the monks and ordered them to be ennobled. A Depressed Smile, Bu Shu</p>
<p>——Reading "Professor Bai Jimei"</p>
<p>In one of the previous issues of "People Magazine," there was an article by Wen Hua Jun called "Professor Bai Jimei." The author's emotion was deep and always made people unforgettable. He wrote out the conscience of a scientist, and also wrote out the oppression, damage, and disregard of society for scientists. Professor Bai Jimei's kindness reflected the cruelty of society; the result of his hard work was "working for ten years without getting rich, and running out of food as soon as he rested," which also reflected that a scientist and a university professor were far from having a promising future as "teaching dancing."</p>
<p>Professor Bai Jimei has written many scientific works, at least twelve kinds in terms of variety; at least ten million words in terms of word count. These works include General Surveying, Advanced Surveying, Geodetic Surveying, Plane Surveying, Hydrological Surveying, Railway Surveying, Applied Astronomy, Least Squares Method, Cartography, Navigation, Aerial Surveying, Mine Surveying, and Mathematical Geography. If he were in another country, his social status would be imaginable. However, he was unfortunate enough to be born in China, so until now, his life is the same as that of ordinary clerks:</p>
<p>"The house is a flat-roofed house that can be reached by hand, a large room divided into five small rooms, one of which is the kitchen. Ducks sometimes fly onto the backs of guests looking for food. Professor Bai takes care of the children while using a broom to drive away those hateful animals. In front of the window is another family dumping sewage and cooking, and there is fly excrement from the summer on the blackened wall... He has many children, and the whole family relies on him. There are no male servants or maids in the house. He does everything himself. Carrying water and sweeping the floor are all done by himself. A brain that is extremely useful to the country and a body that has a lot of energy that is extremely useful to mankind are consumed at home like this." (Wen Hua Jun's words)</p>
<p>This is the result of Professor Bai Jimei's decades of hard work. He was deceived by publishers several times. Once, because he was involved in the "re-repairing of the Fengdu Weir," he was even knocked to the ground by a rascal (who used to be his student) and vomited blood. Because of poverty, he sold off his clothes twice, including dictionaries and thesauruses. The ending of a good person, the ending of a pure, kind, and sincere person who wants to do some work for society, is so miserable. So embarrassing. Although there were foreign reporters in Britain and India who were unfair to him, please look at the reaction of Chinese society: it is still oppression and disregard.</p>
<p>Wen Hua Jun mentioned Professor Bai Jimei's smile several times in the article: when he was cheated by the publisher, he smiled depressingly; when people felt unfair about his experiences, he smiled depressingly again.</p>
<p>What a pitiful smile! I dare not imagine it. Closing my eyes, I seemed to see the figure of this kind old man with white hair. He smiled bitterly, without any desire or hope. His smile showed his fearlessness, and his smile was an extremely sarcastic satire of this society!</p>
<p>Think about those arrogant shouts: Why doesn't China have Einstein? Why doesn't it have Madame Curie? Why doesn't it have Edison, why doesn't it have Balzac, Tolstoy?...</p>
<p>In such shouts, many great scientists, artists, or writers have died in obscurity, have become prematurely senile in overworked environments, have been harmed and insulted and turned into a bitter smile, and have become depressed. Odds and Ends from America, Xu Ziyuan</p>
<p>America's Auxiliary Education</p>
<p>The reason why education in America is so developed is not the many schools, the exquisite architecture, or the extensive facilities, but the excellence of the system. Their system is more flexible and adapts to the needs of all levels of society. Although China's education system is taken from America, it has failed to take its strengths, and has become a formalistic education, which specializes in using exams to restrict young people, and studying has become a profession, maintained by subsidies and loans, and this is unheard of in world education.</p>
<p>Higher education in America is quite expensive. State-run universities charge about 25 yuan per semester. Private universities charge about 10 to 20 yuan per credit, and about 500 yuan or more per semester, such as Harvard University and the University of Chicago. This is because popular education is in elementary schools and not in universities. China is the opposite. Elementary schools collect treasures, while universities are free and even have subsidies. Chinese people who grow up don't know what's going on.</p>
<p>American universities also have graduate schools, which hold classes from 7 to 10 pm, making it convenient for workers, civil servants, and lawyers to enroll in graduate studies. Those who cannot attend can enroll in correspondence courses, but the credits from correspondence courses can be included in the credits required for a bachelor's degree, but not for a master's or doctoral degree.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate students in the city, each university has extension classes in the city. Those who are interested in studying a certain problem can gather a few people and request the local university to set up a class specifically for them, and the school will send a professor to give lectures at the designated location. The American military department has specially set up a military correspondence school, affiliated with the University of Minnesota, for the purpose of enabling conscripted soldiers to continue their studies while fighting on the front lines. The subjects listed are as many as hundreds, and the correspondence departments of universities across the United States are responsible for the handouts and grading. The handouts are mailed to the students on various battlefields on a regular basis. The credits earned are the same as those who attend classes at school. Therefore, most soldiers who have not graduated from university return after several years of fighting, and their university diploma is already firmly in hand. Therefore, there are many remote ways to study in America. You don't have to sit in the classroom to study. You can study while living at home, hiding in a trench, or in a submarine in the Pacific Ocean. University education is not just for experts, so it should be universal. Scholarship should not be accumulated and hoarded, and university education should be extended beyond the school gates. (8) National Strength Diplomacy, Bao Qing</p>
<p>The international situation is essentially a situation of power confrontation. If a country has strong national strength and creates sound politics, then it will be reflected in diplomacy, and it will be easier to grasp the winning ticket, and the speech will not be taken lightly. Otherwise, even if you are good at using strategies of vertical and horizontal combination, or have minor success, you will inevitably fail in the end. Therefore, today's diplomacy is "national strength diplomacy." If weak countries want to survive in this world of power politics, they can only seek to enhance their national strength, or use the international balance of power, or maintain neutrality, or form alliances with strong neighbors to seek survival.</p>
<p>R.L. Buell said: "In order to ensure their security, their power, and the rights of their people, countries cannot resort to law when they have no other choice, but must resort to their own strength, military equipment, and diplomacy backed by force."</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Graduation Exams to Conclude Today</h3>
<p>Students Staying at School Will Visit Gaoqiao Beach</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The graduation exams for students at Jiaotong University will conclude today. The university president, Wu Baozhen, had consulted with the students on whether or not to hold a graduation ceremony. The students all wished to have this opportunity to say goodbye to their professors, but the date of the ceremony has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The recreation group of the Jiaotong University Student Self-Government Association, in order to regulate the lives of students staying at school during the summer vacation, launched a trip to Gaoqiao Beach for all students staying at school yesterday, the date of which is yet to be determined. Regarding the various summer tutoring classes organized by the association, although the school has publicly stated that they have all been stopped, many students from outside the school still went to the association to register yesterday. The person in charge of the Self-Government Association stated: Their purpose in staying at school during the summer vacation to hold various tutoring classes is solely to serve the graduating high school and junior high school students who are seeking further education and to help them get into schools, which does not conflict with the school's intentions.</p>
