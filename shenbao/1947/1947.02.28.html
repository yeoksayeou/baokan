<h3>長吉共軍攻勢受挫　國軍正布署會戰　普蘭店南共軍傾力北犯</h3>
<p>〔本報潘陽廿七日電〕長吉正面共軍攻勢稍挫原因，在於國軍增援部隊到達。又德惠尚有一部有力國軍。　〔本報長春廿七日電〕東北共軍於十八日渡江南犯以來，為時僅旬，節節南迫，且逼近長春，惟自戰鬥開始以還，迄無激烈接觸，據軍事觀察家指陳，國軍係作戰略撤退，與會戰布署，旨在予來犯共軍以致命打擊。　〔法國新聞社北平廿七日電〕長春來客談：中共在東北之春季攻勢，早在意中，國軍總司令部已作適當準備，中北軍或可獲得初步勝利，但終必失敗。目前共軍在東北攻勢目標有二：軍事方面，意欲支援山東作戰之共軍，政治方面，欲在莫斯科會議前夕顯示中共力量及中共運動之一般的重要性。</p>

<p>〔又電〕軍息：吉長路樺皮廠車站（距吉林七十華里），廿六日晨一時許一度被共軍竄佔，此間軍部獲息後，立派警備列車前往搜剿，截至下午二時，已將共軍擊退。至土們嶺前方情况，現尚不明。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿七日電〕王外長廿七日下午四時一刻乘專機由瀋經平返抵首都，至明故宮機場歡迎者有劉錯，甘乃光，王化成，張沅長等數十人。據王於機塲語本報認者，此次前赴平，潘目的，「僅在看看，並與東北人士接見」。記者詢以外傳此去係與蘇方接洽有關東北之各種問題，是否確實？王答：「並不確實」。按王氏係廿日離京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十七日電〕王外長二十七日下午五時於其私邸接見本報記者，談此行感想稱：瀋陽損機程度，達百分之七十至八十，政府擬利用賠償物資及其他國外物資，使其工鑛能及早復興，並信若能善用此類物資，五年至八年內？必可使整個東北高度工業化。王氏談話時，並未說朋瀋陽等地所受損失究係由於何種原因，對如何取得日本賠償物資及其他國外物資，亦未加以說明。</p>
<p>王氏，三十二年前曾作東北之遊，此次舊地重遊，對東北人力，物力殊為贊揚，據謂：余此次在東北，對該地政治，經濟及其他情形曾作觀察，東北之開放，係一九〇〇年以後之事，在此以前，滿人嚴禁關內人民移殖，惟經國人十餘年之勞力，關內冀魯等地同胞移在者年有增加，每年達一二百萬人，其中有春去秋返者，亦有長　定居者。自庚子以來，已自原有之一千萬人增至四千五百萬之衆，此輩皆為關內年富力強，刻苦耐勞之優秀份子，素質極佳，且富進取精神。經彼等數十年之胼手胝足，已將東北基礎奠定，因之，日人雖曾佔領東北達十四年之久，然余此次北行，殊未見該地人民因受十餘年之壓迫磨折而意志消沉，彼等今日堅強如故，刻苦耐勞如故，較之九一八前，殊無遜色。余往昔即如此相信，此次北行，目睹一切，益證實此種概念之準確。以言東北工業情形，東北土地肥沃，日本在東北之工業建設，極大部份僅有六七年歷史，瀋陽規模殊為偉大，但亦僅六七年歷史，目前損毀程度達百分之七十至八十，政府擬利用日本賠償物資及其他國外物資，早日協助工鑛復興。據專家估計，我人若能善用物資，油田資源及民衆力量，亦可於五年至八年之內，使整個東北成為高度化工業區，並超過日本之標準。</p>
<p>談及在平艱感時，王謂：過去與北大。淸華關係殊密，此次在平目擊兩校職員於艱苦之生活精形下，誨人不倦教學精神，己恢復戰前狀態，殊堪敬佩，且感安慰，兩校設備，兩年後或可恢復戰前標準。</p>
<p>對報載渠此行負有重要使命一節，王謂：並不確實。王氏長途跋涉之後，精神殊佳，對國是前途表示樂觀。記者辭出時，王連連謂：「我們希望和平早日恢復，統一早日完成」。語調鄭重而有力，予人不少信心，</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿七日電〕關係方面消息，王外長北行，內政方面任務居多，與外交實無多大關係。令日本報記者曾於南苑機塲休息室中訪問王氏，王氏答記者問稱：（一）我國並未要求參加莫斯科外長會議，記者詢以接收大　，中長路及盛世才與蘇密約諸事，王氏未作答覆。渠告記者，希望國人對東北及外交問題勿過於不安，並勿作不好之假定。（二）王氏繼述其視察東北感想稱：中國在東北的基礎，建築在勞苦大衆上，我們若用軍事力量而征服東北，則此軍事力量終有崩潰之日，我們若用政治方法統治東北，此政治方法亦必有失敗之時，惟此以勞苦民衆為基礎之東北則係穩固不拔者。（三）西沙羣島問題，余相信終可穫合理之解決、惟目前談判尚在進行，余殊不便發表其他談話。記者詢以西沙羣鳥是否仍有一二孤島尚有登陸法軍未撤，王朱作答。（四）中菲商約問題，如菲方不推翻以前中菲業經商定之事項。並放棄排華行動及立法，則中菲商的談判隨時可恢復。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>現階段中的配給問題</h3>
<p>配給如何實施，一船一狠為屬目，尤其是薪工階級，以生活指數凍結後，希望於此獲得一部份補償，對此更為注意。我有許多問題值得研討，特再分別提人工意見如次：</p>
<p>（一）實物折現問題　生活指數，旣經凍結在一月份上，則自本月份起，便該配給實物，以資補償。據政府宣佈，所有米麵，燃料，布疋等項，均已由主管部分別担任。但物品儲存何處，究儲有多少數目。如何於短期間，轉運至配給地點，由何種機構實行配給。受配的單位與人數究有若干，用何種手續分別發放，受配舉位，到底應準備那幾種表格與單據，款繳何處，配價若干，以及時期，地點等等，管尚待規劃指定。而本月份到今日便己終了，此等準備工作，非但在政府方面，還待分別籌辦起來，便是工廠方面，一時也無從措手。所以本市社會局建議：就二月份與一月份之物價，折發差金，我們認為極合時宜，應該從速核定施行。而且此類日用品來源，如果不發生其他問題的話，便是以後各月的配給物品，也不妨照此辦理。因為（一）政府方面，可以免去無數的勞費與扒負，（二）工廠方面，也可以節省許多麻煩與費用，（三）實際上，薪工階級毫不吃虧，（四）手續簡單，（五）時間容易確定。</p>
<p>（二）物品的種類與數量問題　政府規定，工人每人每几米四斗，煤球一百斤，布每半年二丈，有人認為種類和數量均太少，比照公教人員相差太遠，因而紛紛表示異議。或主張（一）種類和數量均應提高，至與公教人員相等，或謂（二）生活指數內所含的物品，均應包括在內，或竟直捷提議，（三）恢復生活指數。其實第二種辦法如果實行，就無異於恢復生活指數。徒然在計算上另做一套手續，未免有點滑稽。所以第三種辦法如果不能實行，那麼，惟一可行的辦法是第一種，即把工人配給品的種窺和數量，分別增加，悉照公教人員辦理。理由是配給品的實施，原以供應平價的日用必需品，以减輕其負担為宗旨，所以受配人的身份，職業等等，本可毋庸分別。在全面配給的國家，除極少數的特別待遇以外，在工人與公教人員之間，原沒有甚麼分別。而實際上，工人的米，麵，布，臨等消費量，或尚在文人以上。所以這個要求，我們也認為狠合理，而且狠易於實行。聞社會局已准予變通辦理，將種類擴充為米，煤，油，鹽，糖，布六種，即與公教人員所配相等，其數量則定為米八斗，煤一担半，油五斤，鹽五斤，糖一斤，布五尺。除糖布照舊外，食糖一項，已與公教人員相等，煤加五成，油鹽兩項，其數量並在公教人員以上，開係照生活指數所本之家計調查作為依據，自係極合理的措置。</p>
<p>（三）配給機關問題　截至現在止，中央和地方的配給機關，始終還沒有確定。所可知者，（一）中央由經濟，糧食兩部及資源委員會供應物品，（二）地方則責由當地行政機關主持、而由現成的物品主管機構特約商店或合作社等担任其事。我們對於疊床架屋的駢枝機關，向來反對。所以辦理配給這一件事，如果可以因利乘便，不增加機關和人員，在原則上自極贊同。不過配給這一件事，不辦這已，辦則頭緒繁多，事事必須顧到火衆的供應和便利，在時間，地點，種類，數量，手續等方面，允須有簡明劃一的辦法，以昭信守，萬不可東推西諉，亂　圈子，致增加受配人的麻煩，而失去大衆的信用。所以我們認為第一，必須有一個負責的機關統籌主管其事，第二，一應必需的辦事人員和經費，實不宜過於吝嗇。</p>
<p>（四）配給對象問題　經濟緊急措施方案及依此方案所補充的日川品供應細則，所配給的對象，似限於公教人員及產業工人。職業工人，商店職員，及私立學校的教職員都不在內。其實同是教職人員，何分公私？至於職業工人及商店職員，現在照生活指數計算發薪者，不在少數。指數旣經凍結，則配給品自應援例照發，以昭一律。此項適用範圍，已由社會局予以補充，凡向依生活指數發薪者，不問其為何種工人，連商店職員在內，一併准予照辦，此項辦法，可以省去無數葛藤，甚為允當</p>
<p>除掉上述四點以外，還有公務員的待遇間題。在日用品實施配給以後，對於每三個月調整一次的辦法，聞有從此擱起之說。假如所傳非虛，似亦值得考慮。因為公務員的薪津，從未依照生活指數計算，其待遇的菲簿，為共見共聞之事實。姑無論三月十五日起實施配給以後，他們所享受的實惠如何，而現在所得的薪津旣遠不及指數計算之高，那麽，同樣凍結，不再調整，終非事理之乎。或謂緊急方案與當局談話中，並無此種表示，當係傳聞之誤，我們也深信其為傳聞之誤。</p>
<h3>重視人民的精神食糧</h3>
<p>現代報紙素有「精神食糧」之稱，人民不能一天不看報，也就等於人民不能一天不吃飯。現代報紙對於社會的功效，實在太大了；所以歐美各國，咸以各國報業的發達作為權衡其文化水準的尺度。我國報業素稱落後，但經過八年抗戰期間的艱苦奮鬥，在勝利之後，確實獲得了長足的進步；姑以上海一埠而論，今日上海之報業，若與抗戰之前相比較，則不論在內容上形式上，及銷路上，都己有顯著的進步。但是在最近幾個月來，全國報業因為外匯的狂漲，白報紙來源减少，都不得不在那裏减張增價，使我國報業又面臨一重嚴重的難關。</p>
<p>輸入臨時管理委員會於本月十八日公佈今年二月至四月的數人限額，其中關於精神食糧的一部份，政府核准紙類進口的外匯，僅三百四十五萬美元，捲烟紙，紙漿以及其他紙張，還要包括在內，所餘外匯可以購置捲筒紙及平面報紙的，僅有二百萬美元，以比全部外匯購買加拿大紙，僅能購得一萬二千五百噸，供給全國善報業應用，我們覺得政府對於紙類輸人的限額，不但限制過嚴，而且顯欠公平。市接受此種辦法的影響的，雖然僅是中國報業；但　惡果必將影響及中國民族的文化大業。因此我們站在報業的立塲，同時又為了文化大業的前途計，不得不向政府大聲疾呼，請求主管當局立即放寬對於紙類進口的限度！</p>
<p>我們對於目前經濟困難情形，不僅完全明瞭，而且對於政府採取限制進口辦法，也認為確有其必要。在此艱難困苦期間，任何一界任何一業，都有緊縮的必要，報業自然不能例外，也應該各自减少篇幅，收縮發行數量，以免浪廢紙張；但是政府的限額和實際需要的距離，相去實在太遠了。以目前上海一地的報業而論，每月的用紙量就要四千噸左右，在這二月至四月間期，上海報業所需報紙驟然減少一半，敎我們同業如何應付這種局面，政府現正實施經濟緊急措置方案，採取這種辦法，又怎樣能使白報紙的價格回跌？何况白報紙是人民的精神食糧，一日不能中斷，否則人民在精神上就會發生恐慌，其嚴重性，並不下於糧食恐慌。記得在這次大戰期，英國在最危險的一年，四週受德國潛水艇的封鎖，連糧食也發生問題了，但是在這一年丙、報紙輸入英國，仍達五十萬噸之鉅足見英國常局對於精神食糧的重視。英國戰時尚能如此，我國在平時豈可不顧人民的精神食糧！我國人民的觀念，向視「精神重於物質」，政府當局怎能坐視人民的精神食糧發生恐慌呢？</p>
<p>本年度第一季輸入限額的公佈，或因時間的匆促，對於各種貨物的限額，均未能顧及其實際的需要，使我們不能不表示遺憾，對於紙類的處理，失之公平；旣如上述；此外還有一事，因其亦與文化有關者，也不能不指出，就是輸人臨時管理委員會，對於外國製成的影片進口，旣未加以任何限制，但對於製成影片的底片，却加以限制，其影響所及，對於國產電影業，不啻為一大打擊，對於外國影片，反而獎勵其進口。這種辦法的不合理，也就不言可知了。</p>
<p>要之，我們對於政府規定的輸入限額，尤其是有關於文化事業的幾項，不得不向政府請命，請求政府為文化大業的前途着想，多多注意人民的精神食糧，從速放寬對於紙類進口的限度！</p>

<h3>美國提出託管協定草案　蘇建議修正三點　安理會展至下月七日辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿七日廣播：安理會今日開會時，殊聯代表葛羅米柯對於美國要求代管太平洋中前日本委治島嶼所提之條件，立即予以接受。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處成功湖廿六日電〕安理會今開會討論前日本代管島問題，首由美代表奧斯汀申述美方立塲，旋由蘇代表葛羅米柯致詞，葛氏重申前雪，謂各該島嶼之交由美方管理，至為公允。並提出三點要求加以修正。（一）軍的中「成為美國完整的一部份」一句應即劃去；（二）草約中「促進居民自治」一句應改為「促進居民自治或獨立」，（三）安理會有權更改或終止託管協定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖廿六日電〕美代表奧斯汀，本日向安理會提出一項建議，主張將日本前在太平洋內所代管之島嶼，立即交付美國託管，並在馬紹爾羣島，馬里安納羣島，及加羅林羣島設立「軍略區」。但此等島嶼之最後命運，應由對日和的加以決定。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯對此表示贊同，安理會旋即決定即將澳洲之建議，延期至三月七日加以討論，俾各代表獲得充分之時間，向其本國政府請示。</p>
<p>美代表奧斯汀在提出上述建議時發表演說稱：美國之建議足以表示美國人民決意防止此等鳥嶼再度成為對美國或對聯合國其他會員國發動侵略之跳板，美國之目的乃在確保其本國之安全及國際之集體安全。美國現仍信守大西洋憲章，在戰後決不從事擴張領土。美國將依照大西洋憲章之規定，而管理太平洋內以前日本之代管島嶼。今後吾人將設立國際管制制度，籍以管制軍隊與武器，並管制谷該島嶼人民在經濟政治文化及社會上之發展。美國現行託管辦法，決不妨碍國際管制制度所規定一切措置之實施。太平洋內前日太代管島嶼之最後命運，必須由對日和的決定之。美國使提議將其所業己佔領之島嶼，艦速交美國託管，此等島嶼在戰略上極為重要。日本曾違反其所應盡之義務，而將各該島嶼轉變成為防禦極為堅固之壁壘，籍以隔雖美國與關島非律濱羣島曁遠東英荷兩國屬地之聯繫。世上最重要之軍略據點，現均在列強絕對統治之下，但美國僅提議予以託管，並不擬將此等島嶼加以歸併。美國所提託管草案，亦計及聯合國上屆全體大會所通過之託管協定。依照託管憲章，此等島嶼之上應建築基地，美國向有關係各國提出託管計劃，可謂已履行其義務。觀於聯合國其他會員國均不企求管理此等島嶼，故美國此舉，似更為合理。美國相信托管協定可立即付諸實施，母需等待對日和的之簽訂云。蘇聯代表葛羅米柯繼起發言，表示其本國政府贊同美國之計劃，並謂，吾人授權美國管理此等島嶼完全合理，良以戰時美國在此等島嶼曾蒙受之損失，遠較其他盟國為鉅故也云。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿六日電〕共和黨參議員即參議院代理議長范登堡，本日向參議院軍事委員會提出一項草案，其內容依照杜魯門總統之建議，主張將美國海陸空三軍合併，以利統一指揮。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿六日電〕英國出席聯合國機構代表賈德幹爵士，本日與聯合國機構秘書長賴依舉行會談，商討是否可能召開聯合國大會特別會議，以討論巴勒斯坦問題。事後據可靠方面消息，組依秘書長會答曰：召開聯合國特別會議頗多困難，允以費用問題，最難解決，蓋以召開聯合國大會所費約需一百萬美元故也。但英國政府若正式提出此項要求，則余仍準備加以考慮。據非官方人士稱：賴依秘書長與賈德幹爵士對於巴勒斯坦問題將否向安理會或託管理事會提出一節，亦曾加以討論。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦廿六日合衆電〕英政府高級人員頃宣布：英國正研究在聯大九月開會前，將巴勒斯坦問題提交大會之特別會議之可能性。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕白宮今日發表聲明，　英下院辯論巴勒斯坦問題時指責美國對巴勒斯坦及猶太移民之利益，係以美國國內黨爭為動機等語，十分不奉，而足以引起誤解。該聲明並謂：美國對巴勒斯坦，具有遠期之興趣，美國人民不論政治派別如何均表示深切之關注。杜魯門總統於一九四六年十月四日發表之聲明，意僅在重申前此於一九四五年夏季所發表對於巴勒斯坦及對太移民之態度而已。此一態度係以總統之深願提出巴勒斯坦之合理解決辦法為基礎。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿六日電〕政府某高級人員本日談稱：英閣員事前均知貝文外相將發表聲明，譴責杜魯門總統之破壞巴勒斯坦談判。據稱：貝文希望美國能明瞭「如果此後發生同樣性質之談判，當以國際立塲考慮之，美國應避免發表片面聲明，此種聲明，對談判並無有利之影響」云。</p>

<h3>舉世矚目的北極</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室</p>
<p>…希望這裏將成為交換文化和物品的要道，不要將在太平洋扮演過的慘劇，再搬到這裏來扮演，將人類文明的罪惡，糟塌這淸白的所在。</p>
<p>北極，已成為今日各國競爭所注意的焦點，這塊遼遠的雪海，在不久的將來，將成為航空界的逐鹿塲，國際競爭的重心。人類從事於征服兩極的奮鬥，已有一千多年的歷史，最初是為了探求科學的秘密，繼而企圖獲得些寶藏，現在的目的，則轉趨於國防了。</p>
<p>北極探險　史實一斑</p>
<p>遠在第九世紀，挪威的航海家曾到過北極一帶，這是北極探險的先鋒，迨美洲大陸發現以後，許多航海家探險家就認為跨越北極，是從西方到亞洲的捷徑。一五五三年，英國探險家威勞貝從倫敦出發，是想穿越這條捷徑的第一人，不幸被阻於白海之北，全體船員慘遭非命。一八七九年瑞典探險家諾登斯吉爾特，從瑞典的哥德堡出發，到白令海峽，費了一年的時間，才第一次完成了這條航綫。此後又有人繼續前往，至一九三二年，蘇聯破冰船「西伯利亞柯夫」號在希米德教授領導之下，完成了阿欽格爾到海參崴的航程，使北極探險獲得重大的進展。</p>
<p>蘇聯重視北方航路</p>
<p>蘇聯的海疆，大部份是沿靠北冰洋的，所以對於北極也最為關心，成立了北極學院。米希德於一九三二年打通了北冰洋的航路以後，更引起蘇聯探險家的興趣。接着又有破冰船「魯克」號僅在八十三天中，從海參崴到達穆爾門斯基。一九三七年，又有航空探險的壯舉，而獲得成功。從此一向認為是幻想的北極，不再覺得它神秘了。同時經營北極，也格外具體化。蘇聯於是建纂勒奈河葉尼寒河的港口，在北冰洋各島上建立無綫電台，還添設了五十餘所北極站，從事研究和建設的工作。蘇聯對於這塊新土地的發掘和經營，不遺餘力，數年來得到很大的成就。</p>
<p>蘇聯向外的通路，除了西方的渡羅的海，和遠東的鄂霍次克海之外，其餘都是被冰山寒流包圍着。過去蘇聯竭力要尋求幾處和世界通商的港口，東北鐵路的職築，和航終的開關，對土耳其要攫取韃靼尼爾海峽，都是從運貨觀點出發的。日俄戰爭中，俄國的艦隊必須撓道好望角，開到日本悔岸，遠水救不得近火，終於遭遇失敗。從此又要在北方闢一條航行直徑，是故北極的經營，是具有軍事上戰略上重大的意義的。</p>
<p>北極周圍國際形勢</p>
<p>北極是亞·歐·美三洲包圍巾的一區，假使以北極點作為圓心，沿着各國的海岸，畫幾條輻射線，分割這圓形的土地，那末蘇聯正對着圓心成一百六十度的角，佔圓週九分之四的長度。其次是加拿大，佔圓週的四分之一，格林蘭佔六分之一，美國的阿拉斯加佔十二分之一，挪威比阿拉斯加更短些。這一個輻射的圓形，表示着各國在北極逐鹿的形勢。</p>
<p>再就航空的距離來說：從紐約為中心，向西北經阿拉斯加，越西伯利亞而達莫斯科，計萬餘哩。向西經舊金山，橫渡太平洋，抵達東京，將及九千哩，若再東至上海，亦達萬哩航程。今若取道北極，距離便大為縮短。紐約莫斯科間之航程，祇有四千八百哩，紐約至東京為六千九百哩，至南京亦僅七千五百里。較大陸飛行可以减少四分之一，甚至一半以上的航程。</p>
<p>今後將成航空捷徑</p>
<p>空軍在第二次世界大戰中，已發揮了極大的威力，而原子能的發明，更增強了空軍的效用。今後在國防上，戰略上，空軍將更具重要性。這一塊包圍在亞歐美三洲間的領空，是航行捷徑，不久將代替地中海，太平洋，而成為航空網密佈的區域。希望這裏能成為交換文化和物品的要道，不要將在太平洋扮演的慘劇，搬到這裏來扮演，將人類文明的罪惡，汚穢了這淸白的所在。</p>
<h3>胡志明總統　再呼籲和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社西貢廿七日電〕越盟總統胡志明最近致函法總統歐禮和，請渠及法國人民宣布對於此一無意識流血戰爭之意見，該函或將由法國駐東京安南兩省專員聖特尼携返巴黎，函內有謂戰爭不斷增加越南之痛苦，法軍之任務在恢復和平與秩序，實屬慌言，蓋未有法軍之處，即無衝突發生。吾人茲再度鄭重聲明吾人之目的僅為統一及獨立，吾人決尊軍法開之經濟及文化利益。美國固自由之先鋒，豈可向爭取基本權利之民族作戰。法國如立即下令停戰，無數之生命財產可以保全，吾人問之友誼亦可恢復。不然，法國將喪失一切，一無所得。戰爭僅足增加雙方之仇恨。法國難有飛機坦克，但吾人則具有堅定之意志，以為合理要求竹後盾。吾人不信法國願意繼續此一不光榮的戰爭，故請法國政府明白宣布其對越盟之政策。吾人之宗旨至明，即願在法國聯邦內取得統一與獨立，並欲有合理的和平。</p>

<p>物品配售範圍擴大　按指數計薪者　俱得申請供應　種類增為六項數量分別加多　社局今日公佈平均價</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕今日為二月份最後之一日，本月各廠商職工之薪津究應如何計算，昨據社會局吳局長告；「除依一月份之生活指數發給外，並實行「差額貼補制度」，即將政府所定配售之數種必需日用品，以其二月份平均市價與一月份平均市價之差額，由廠方折合法幣發給之。該項配售日用品之數量與種類，本祗規定食米每人每月五市斗，煤球每人每月一百市斤，布每人每半年二丈，且祗以工廠職工為限。此次由吳市長與本人晋京向當局力爭，經　主席許可，已將日用必需品供應之種類與數量，增加為：</p>
<p>（一）米或麵粉—每人每月米八市斗，或麵粉二袋。</p>
<p>（二）布匹—每人每月五尺即每半年三丈。</p>
<p>（三）燃料—每人每月煤球一百五十市斤。</p>
<p>（四）食鹽—每人每月三市斤。</p>
<p>（五）食糖—每人每月一市斤。</p>
<p>（六）食油—每人每月五市斤。</p>
<p>其供應範圍亦擴大為凡以生活指數計算薪津者一律照此辦理。此法試行，暫先以本市為限。社會局定於今日發表上項六種主要必需品之一月份平均價，二月份平均價，差額及折合數。本月份之薪津即照此計算。」末據吳局長稱，此辦法現係試行性質，少則三月，多則五月。</p>
<p>主席授權相機辦理</p>
<p>按自政府公佈經濟緊急措施方案，將一月份生活指數凍結，而供應職工之日用必需品之極類與數量又較公敎人員為少，各地職工聞訊紛表反對。蔣主席於廿五日下午臨時電召吳市長及吳局長晋京商討此事。兩氏即於當晚十一時携所擬建議。搭夜車赴京。廿六日上午晋謁宋院長，中午主席召宴，席間兩氏即將所擬建議，即本市職工日用必需品供應之種類應與公教人員相等，其數量則以編製生活指數時之數量作根據等二點提出。主席認為若上海方面非如此做不可，得依此辦理。兩氏因在京任務完畢，即於常日下午三時四十五分搭快車返滬，晚十一時許抵達。</p>
<p>不欲領配實物者　得實行差額折現</p>
<p>吳局長昨告記者：本人官可不故，政策一定要推行。此次所擬辦法旣蒙政府採納，當盡力先使本市工人生活問題解決，然後再以全力抑平物價。本市產業工人共廿一萬六千七百五十人，此次經變通辦法，規定凡薪津按生活指數計算者（按即不復僅限於公敎人員及產業工人）皆得依上項辦法辦理後，的可包括五十萬人。今後是否實行差額貼補制度抑或供應實物，全視廠方意見。因甚多廠主對供應實牧之品質及領貨分配手續認為過於麻煩者，故勞資雙方如同意實行差額貼補制度，則由廠方以差額折合法幣發給職工。否則若向社會局申請代購實物供應亦可。社會局於每月底公佈六稱日用必需品之平均價及與上一月之差額。其計算係根據一日至廿五日止之平均價格。該項編制係以零售價格作根據，而不以批發價格計算。社會局一定求其合理，務使貼補之數，能在市上買到實物。</p>
<p>關於工人仍望恢復以生活指數計算工資，吳局長對此表示：恐不可能。</p>
<p>下月中旬　可望配售</p>

<p>留英須知　我留英學生函告</p>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕三十四年留英公費生吳傳鈞，在利物浦大學研究地理，並担任我留英學生總會副會長兼對內委員會主席，近以去年考取之留英學生即將出國，特致函敎部，希將「留英須知」發表，原函如下：敎育部留英公費暨中英文敎基金會赴英同學公鑒：適聞諸兄即將首途來英，曷勝欣慰，傳鈞謹代表留英全體同學致歡迎之意，並將此間生活情形，及來此宜有之準備，擇要奉吿以供參考。衣着皆須憑衣券（Coupon）購買，每人每年僅得42個，而各項衣着所需單位甚多，如：襯衣（7），全套西服（26），皮鞋（9），大衣（18），雨衣（8），睡衣每套（8）汗背心（4），襯褲（8），襪子（2）。諸同學宜多帶襯衣襪子等易破損之衣着，否則衣券必將不敷。每一新同學來此，可向貿易局（Board　of　Trade）聲Extra　Coupon每人可得70-150不等。至於各項衣着價格，則均較國內為賤。</p>
<p>食</p>
<p>英國食物貧苦，世所共知，但今日之情形，尤為窘困，祖國之茶葉與各項鹹貨，如可能不妨略帶，俾思家時不供咀嚼，華茶進口免稅，允宜多帶，並可餽贈英國友人，必受歡迎。</p>
<p>各大學宿舍容量有限，十九皆已客滿，必得寄宿在外，可請各地之British　Council代覓，有為Bed　of　Breckfosh僅供宿舍與早飯，有為Board　Residance兼供晚飯，以後者為宜，每週房金約二——三鎊，每月生活費用各地相差無幾，大概至少十八，九鎊，如欲添置衣服及書籍則非二，三十鎊不可。</p>
<p>學</p>
<p>各項硏究資料，凡國內能蒐集者，宜全部帶此，其有已發表之英文作品更為需要。各校學位頒給年限不同，大多碩士二年，博士三年，倫敦大學較寬，二年可穫Ph．D．但倫敦研究生太多，平時不易與敎授會面，故欲獲實益者，宜於倫敦以外選擇。諸同學如欲知某校詳情者，可請來函詢問，常代探復。</p>
<p>其他應携帶之物件（一）祖國風景照片，及各種生活景態，國畫，手工小品。（二）親友家屬照片。（三）郵票及其他小件紀念品。（四）綢面絲棉袍一襲及其他絲織品。最重要者為「較有系統的祖國各項詳細消息一，最為外人所急欲知悉者。</p>
<p>留英中國同學共三百餘人，其中在各校研究者的百餘人，在各工廠實習者約百餘人，餘者皆已畢業在各工廠或機關正式服務。組有留英學生總會，每夏全體集會一次。各城皆有分會，開會决數較多。本年起特成立對內委員會以便與國內各學校取得聯絡，而歡迎新同學亦為本會職旨之一。諸同學首途西來之日，請電吿船名抵英日期及港口，俾便屆時到埠迎接襄助一切。（該電於抵英前一星期在船上發亦可）（又中英間航空的十日——十五日可達，每信貼八百元）附吳君通訊處如下：Julian　c．c．Wu．School　of　Geography．LiverpoolUniversity　England</p>

<p>本年敎育復員費　敎部請政院增撥　預計需欵九百六十五億</p>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕敎部因各省市受戰時損失，尤以校舍多數全燬，或破壞不堪，修復需費至鉅，加以戰後復員還鄕，學生衆多，增級設校，用款甚夥，於三十五年度，曾呈請政院，撥發各省市敎育復員經費五百七十九億元。嗣經政院於發給各省市復員費二百億中，劃撥一百三十七億元，為敎育復員經費，以之分配各省市。因粥少僧多，各省市所得無幾，湖南一省敎育之破壞損失最大，亦僅領得十餘億元，不敷建復之用。今年物價高漲，各省市敎育復員，待款孔亟，敎部今年又呈請政院，撥發九百六十五億元，為各省市本年度力謀恢復敎育之建築校舍，添置設備，及添校增級，以救濟靑年失學之需。現尙在政院審核中。</p>

<p>中學男女分校　原則不能變更　分部分班略可通融</p>
<p>〔本報南京航訊〕敎部對中學男女分校，前已通令施行。各校對此事，有已經遵行，有因困難請求緩行者。本報記者頃訪敎部主管人員，據談，敎部對中學男女分校前已決定，因男女之性情不同，在小學可不分校，在中學則須發揮男女各有之特長，故敎部令中學男女分校。外國實行男女分校者頗多，如德，日，法等國。美國情形不同，因一般人都先受八年之小學敎育，等於我國已受過小學六年，中學二年之敎育，故中學不必男女分校。敎部於中學男女分校，原則不能變更，業己通令實施。惟各校有特殊情形者，可以分設女子部，或女生班，則男校亦可變通，容納女生云。</p>

<p>前國立四川水產職校學生　電請敎部復校改組　繼續培植水產技術人材</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕前國立四川水產職業學校學生黃紹瑀徐順志傳成立等二百餘人，頃聯名電請敎部朱部長，懇將該校改為國立高級水產職業學校，繼續培植水產技術人才，以應社會迫切需要。原電如下：「查本校成立於抗戰初期，初附設於四川合川國立第二中學內，名為國立二中水產部。嗣因參政會及十中全會之提議，始改組為國立四川水產職業學校，校址仍設於四川合川。首由陳謀琅先生充任校長，後由現任校長王剛先生繼任。慘淡經營，始有今日之規模。嗣抗戰勝利，本校奉令遷蘇，初係賡續辦理，後交省接辦。目隷設江蘇省敎育廳以後，公費生膳費每人每月僅發二萬元。校方對生等困難情形，本極明瞭，為維持生等最低限度之膳食，每人每月須虧墊五千元。最近物價暴漲，每人每月虧墊至二萬餘元。其他經費亦屬異常拮据，致本校原有班次一再减縮，一切擴充設備計劃，亦無從進行。生等或為保育生，或為復員靑年軍，或為招訓會分發之流亡靑年，在抗戰中備嘗艱苦，原冀於勝利後能安心肄業，將來獻身社會。不料轉徒八九千里後，反致無法維持生活。去秋上海新聞報載有鈞部擬成立國立高級水產職業學校之消息，生等以為鈞部旣決定恢復國立水產學校，必就歷史較久之本校加以改組。最近本校收到鈞部發下國立高級水產職業學校鈐記及一二三月員工生活輔助費五千萬元，生等異常興奮，深感鈞座提倡水產敎育嘉惠學生之至意。嗣又聞係誤發，則又萬分沮喪，百思不得其解。査本校自創立迄今，業經八載，原已略具規模，與其另行創辦，不如將本校擴充改組，繼續為國家培植人才，使生等不致流離失所。是否可行，理合電請鑒核示遵」。</p>
<p>公敎子女敎貸金　仍循成例續辦</p>
<p>上海市政府為優待同人子女就學，關於敎育貸金，本學期仍循成例，令飭市銀行賡續辦理。聞其辦法，凡無力籌措子女敎育費用者，均得向市銀行申請敎育貸金。本期貸金申請日期，自二月十五日起，至三月六日止，（暫定為二十天）。該行於舉辦敎育貸金期內，在九江路五〇號總行設敎育貸金組，負責辦理貸金一切事宜。淸寒家畏可向市銀行或市行辦事處塡具申請書，速同就學子女之成績單，證件，送交貸金組審核云。</p>

<p>香島球報　光華拉角迎戰　仍遭　〔本報香港航訊〕昨週六銀銀牌戰，星島兄弟同被迫和，今日南華甲乙同出師，戰塲在快活谷香港會塲。</p>
<p>二時一刻，乙組先打頭陣，對手是警察，今年南華乙組陣容，幷不堅挺，能够進入準決賽週，已屬倖運，何况今日所碰，是蠻打硬搶的警察，結果在警察以打鬥的方式下面，慘遭淘汰，結果是二比一，警察搶得決賽權。</p>
<p>心有餘力不足</p>
<p>輪到甲組爭奪戰，南華出戰光華，在會前戰，光華得由南華轉投的郭英祺，林德譜助陣，又在廣州拉得鍾燦光踢右翼，更復朝夕練兵，準備打倒南華，但結果心有餘而力不足，四比一，南華奪得決賽權。</p>
<p>南華陣勢，沒有多大改變，陳德輝帶傷掛帥，只有原來的守門黃華繼，功夫不大可靠，改用新人孫寳安上陣。</p>
<p>南華連中二球</p>
<p>球證英倫，一聲號令，展開戰局，光華先攻，但因為同是華隊，大家對於戰法，相常瞭解，故戰來無法打開僵局。</p>
<p>近廿分鐘內，光華未有正式射過一决門，南華也只得三次虛扣機會，而南華的右後衛林汝順，却在混戰中受傷，—不久帶傷復出。</p>
<p>廿二分鐘時，南華得機反攻，揮軍直進，光華後衛在禁區內，救球犯規，李碩友主踢十二碼，南華乘機先取一球。</p>
<p>接着碩友再得光華一守衛頭頂錯誤之球，一脚拉去，球急而疾，南華遂以二比零領前。</p>
<p>下塲再戰，南華陳德輝脚傷復發，踢來不及初時活躍，最後且與左翼碩友換位。</p>
<p>繼續賽來，光華力謀打破光蛋，南華却要確保勝利，球來球去，全無精彩鏡頭。</p>
<p>總結果四比一</p>
<p>直至最後五分鐘，好戲來臨，四十分鐘南華進攻，球已到底綫，永强只得勉强橫撇，球從光華門前滾過，文治刁鑽，猛奔前來。連人帶球衝入，三比零。</p>
<p>中綫再開，光華乘對方右後衛受傷，輕軍從此路突進，果見左翼景聰將球傳中，英祺迎頭一點，光蛋遂破，成三比一。</p>
<p>但說時遲，那時快，南華一開球，即乘對方陣脚未穩，永强得、球單刀飛進，果也，再奪一球，以四比一終結全塲。</p>
<p>南華就此奪得銀牌決賽權，但全戰幷不佳妙，大有南華踢得不好，光華打得更差之感—觀衆也遠不如昨日擁擠，香港球迷，看球水準實在不錯，是日雙方列陣：</p>

<p>紡管會第廿六次例會決定　調整收購棉紗價格　廿支標準紗每件二百五十萬元</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第二十六次例會，於昨日下午五時許，在市政府會議室舉行。到吳兼主委，李副主委，委員束徽章，王啓宇，吳味經，榮鴻元，唐星海，郭機活，及該會業務處長劉文騰等。討論至七時許，始吿散會。討論經過，決定重要議案兩起：（一）紡管會二月份收購棉紗之價格，規定廿支標準棉紗，每件為二百五十萬元。其他件支棉紗，均依此比例推算。（二）關於附設織機各紗廠，其需用棉紗，超過其棉紗產量之半數，須向紡管會優先購回棉紗之價格問題，席間討論經過，認為本年因第一個月初辦收購事宜，致各方在手續上，不無延冗情事。現為顧全情理計，決以一月份之收購價格，與各廠出售棉紗通知書送到紡管會之日起第四日之紡建公司售價，以該兩項之差價，由紡管會及購回棉紗各廠，各負担半數，以示公允。</p>
<p>紗市好轉</p>
<p>昨日紗市略見轉機，晨初粵帮稍有買入，同業亦吸，廿支特雙馬回升至三百八十萬，迄收市時終因購買力有限，供售頗不乏人，價復見軟，然終較前日好起五萬左右，惟特雙馬獨漲廿萬之譜。</p>
<p>棉紗交易市場　闢客幫買賣處</p>
<p>棉紗市塲自經濟監察團前往澈査後，塲外交易業吿絕跡，外悉該所為便於外埠客商購貨便利起見，特開放二樓，闢為客帮買賣臨時接治處，並限制買賣貨價不得超過市價，至經紀人之利潤問題，聞在縝密商討中。</p>
<p>棉布挺秀</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况本客兩帮俱有進胃，故市氣甚俏，十二磅龍頭細布每疋步升七千元，價為十四萬九千元，五福細布亦好五千餘元，為十四萬五千元，其他各檔及士林布色布等市亦挺秀，紡建公司照例開售，藍鳳細布為十三萬五千元。</p>
<p>人造絲四千箱　下月可由日運滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局向日本　帥總部易貨之人造絲，本年度第一批四千箱，預計可於下月廿日運滬。聞日本陳貨人造絲，刻巳全部用罄。新貨以囿於原料，其中尤以食一項，最感缺乏，致生產量一時不敷需要量。又該局以大豆對義大利易取人造絲一事，茲以義方對人造絲開價，每逢達美金四百廿元，價格尙未能接近，故一時尙無端倪。</p>
<p>又該局本週以配價問題，本週一及週四之人造絲，未能循例配售。茲聞該局下週一召開之代理政府物資委員會席上，對下週一　織廠及下週四織帶廠之配絲，大致可無問題云。</p>
<p>黑市回疲</p>
<p>昨市人造絲因悉配售已有望不過配售價略予提高，故黑市價亦稍呈疲軟，一二〇號高山有光晨開八百〇五萬元，最小曾喊七百八十萬元，後因實銷戶乘低吸收，又回高喊八百十萬元收盤，下午堅持，無甚交易。廠經洋行無吸意，實銷戶略有採辦，價與上日相仿，杭州客採辦零担陳絲，做價七百卅萬元。綢貨因連朝原料高漲，廠方無售意，故喊價略提高。被面昨大十萬元，格子璧縐大五百元，華錦縐大工百元，但因與成本相去甚遠，故無人肯賣出，盛杭各貨，仍喊上日原盤。</p>
<p>台糧公司配售　第八期食糖</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕台灣糖業公司，昨循例開售本年度第八期食糖。該公司為避免各糖商作不合理之申請計，本期之配糖量，係按各糖商在本年第五六七三期中，平均之實購額配售，以示公允。昨日剛售廿二號粗砂白糖共二四七一五包，配價每市担為二十萬元。另配冰糖四三〇包，配價每市祖三十萬元。廿二號粗砂白糖，尙係初决發配，議價亦甫於本過三在市社會局議價會上決定。</p>
<p>糖價轉軟</p>
<p>昨糖市以北客有來電止貨者，去化頓見淸淡，故昨日雖値台公司標價已有調整，趨勢仍軟。公會劃盤，各檔白糖回小萬元之譜，號貨如順德靑呌十四萬元，未成交。興化白為二十萬〇八九千元，興赤十五萬元至十四萬六七千元，成交百數十件。刁靑亦僅呌價，行方觀望少進。</p>
<p>新買不繼空頭施威　華股多以低價結束　美亞水泥均告跌停板</p>
<p>華股昨隔前買戶盡屬浮多，一經空方施展壓力，近午不支而竭，午後雖有小波動，無如新買不繼，終見怯疲，美亞水泥同吿跌停。</p>
<p>晨開見昂，遞交上塲即充份被空方所迫低，塲內二二號二號一三號一七一號一三七號一五一號五七號均售，遞永紗又降為二二七〇元。一九二號二一五號二二四號均進，升為二三〇〇元，一四五號九七號一三七號一九九號紛加供售，成交不多，缺乏維持，逐步盤低至二一九五元。掉期貼息由銀行帮四五號三一號二二〇號一一〇號五六號等貼進而見低，日息不過一角四左右，人心尙定，經二二號一四一號一七三號一七七號七六號來進，逐漸拉上，二三五號八五號一八四號亦納，遞永紗回升至二二八〇元。九七號二〇六號趁高脫手，降為二二四〇元。二二四號八五號一五二號尙來買進，曾升至二二九〇元。一四五號二二二號一八四號一七九號等均售，浮多連袂斬售，現交亦低，套賣紛紜，維持缺乏，乃終不支。美亞斬售之風更烈，迫低至跌停，人心不支而疲。近午浮戶恐慌，終以低價結束。結果較前收計永紗信和華豐新光勤興各跌一成左右，美亞景福中法迫近跌停，新華漲後回低，軋升少許。遞交因前日祗半天交易，是以比較之下，永紗信和華豐新光均見平定，美亞升一成，冷股統益升一成弱，火柴徵升，餘微降迄跌半成不等。</p>
<p>午後二三五號上場曾進遞永紗升為二一九九〇元，一五一號則賣，退至二一六〇元。此時徘徊不定，成交有限，後以美亞由八四號賣到跌伴，一七八號二二號售出，退至二一五〇元。此後謠言又引起小波動，一七七號二一八號進至二二三〇元，二二二號進後忽出二二三號一七七號一三號二二四號一五三號八四號一四五號一五二號紛售再吿不支。水泥由一四九號賣到停板，美亞重又跌停，人心大虛。八四號一三號賣胃甚濃，面以低價結束。結果較前收計永紗華豐新光跌半成强，景福勤興美亞中法各挫成半光景，新華徵升，遞交永紗信和微降，華豐新光小升，美亞雖吿跌停，但較前日千收尙升一成。冷股火柴微升，水泥跌停，中紡統益內衣景綸平平，餘徽挫迄跌半成不等。塲外各股微跌。</p>
<p>畢聯代職綢貨　各國紛電訂購</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕絲織聯營公司代織之綢，第一期出品為八萬疋，下月內可交貨，以原料品質甚高，故成品亦屬上選。中蠶於週前巳分電各國求售，現加電已絡續收到，印度瑞士南美諸國均願購買，價格俟出貨時另議。據有關人士估計，的可售四百萬美金，較之以生絲出口，更覺合算。至於外傳國絲輸美，因品質低劣而不受歡迎一節，記者曾詢諸有關人士，據云：並無所聞。惟抗戰八年之中，蠶絲備遭摧殘，對品種頗有影響；而去年出口之絲，因抗戰方吿結束，絲業元氣未復，品質及標準化略遜，容或有之，相信經一年休養補充後，今年必有改善。至於我國出口時之商品檢査，素甚嚴格，評績時往往有意减少一二分，以期提高在國外市塲上之信用。</p>
<p>全國行莊戰前未提存款　總額一億五千萬元　如何償付國防會研究辦法中</p>
<p>據商業行莊權威方面統計，全國行莊戰前客戶未提存款，目前總額尙有一億五千萬元。因行莊方面對存款之貶値，難負其責，故對過去法院判決，戰前存款以千倍付給，頗難遵辦。茲悉：對戰前存款增値付還一事，業已由本市銀行公會具文呈請財政部，轉送最高國防會議，該會刻正在研究辦法中。聞短期內即可公佈。</p>
<p>限制增設行莊　財部有新規定</p>
<p>廿六日以前未開業　一律撤消核准原案</p>
<p>財政部為配合經濟緊急措施方案，除規定本市等各指定地區不得再仃增設銀錢行莊外，現為澈底整飭商業金融機構起見，已採取進一步之措置，几本市業經奉准復業之銀行錢莊，及增設之分支行號，至（廿六）日止，尙未開業者，其核准原案，應即予以撤銷，不得再行開業云。</p>
<p>統債盤穩</p>
<p>公債昨盤穩少許，統丙晨開六六〇〇元，五五二室五四四室有納，高價六八〇〇元，三六〇室六〇四室五〇三室脫手，低價六三〇〇元，最後在六五〇〇元關掙扎，結果較前收甲乙升二百元，丙升四百元，丁種平平，統戊好六百元，成交約三百萬元。</p>
<p>外股交易仍少</p>
<p>外股昨交易仍少，熱股有較多之存多了結，是以續降較多，小股反形平定，結果較前收計怡紗英聯各跌一成，會德豐業廣各降半成，紙業怡啤航業鋼業各跌少許。</p>
<p>零售油價已定　每市斤二千七百元</p>
<p>吳市長對本市食油問題，至為重視，為抑平食油市價，曾數度召集食油廠商會談，除決定供給各油廠需用生產原料外，並由食油聯配處恢復分配零售油號食油，配價核定每擔二十五萬元，各區已分別辦理申請配購，昨日浦東區及市中心區業已開始出貨，茲悉吳市長對該批配油，限定門市零售價每市斤二千七百元，今日全市可照上項售價應市。</p>
<p>工商押匯銀團　第一組籌組竣事　即與中央銀行簽訂合約</p>
<p>中央銀行，為鼓勵物資流通，及輸出起見，特以押匯方式，貸放工商貸款，此項辦法，早經四聯總處理事會核定，由商業行莊，組織工商押匯銀團，向中央銀行轉抵押。據悉：本市國貨，市民，等十家銀行，業經商得同意，組織第一組工商押匯銀團，刻始竣事，已推代表向中央銀行正式接洽，日內即可成立，與中央銀行訂立轉押匯合約，每一團員提交銀團之債權，以國幣四億元為最高額，向中央銀行轉押匯，則以七五折計算，計為國幣三億元。各商號向團員申請之押匯，每戶總額，以一億元為限，押匯及轉押匯期間，至多為三十天。據中央銀行負責人談：申請押匯之貨物，必須為（一）民生日用必需品，（二）當地特產，（三）出口物資，除此之外，任何貨物，均不得接受押匯。其他各行莊亦在洽商籌組押匯銀團，第二第三等組，不久即將出現。</p>
<p>木材市況趨緊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：福州方面，金融業頭寸奇緊，滬市對福州匯款限制頗嚴，故木材市塲，以最近閩木來滬堪慮，人心頓轉緊張，各貨蠕蠕欲漲，杉木大條每尺仍站一千以內，但甚少賣出。松板，三夾板略漲，杭木則到源充沛，實銷亦繁，每兩（大碼子）為二六萬元，（小碼子）為三〇萬元，脚地頗為堅俏。</p>
<p>又訊：杉本市氣尙穩，洋松前决定貨有到埠，質料比美松次劣，價在四千元內。</p>
<p>台茶取沙出口禁令　烏龍茶四萬公斤輸美</p>
<p>〔台灣廿六日電〕省行政長官公署自昨日起，取消茶葉出口蔡念，第一批商人李錫揚申請出口之烏龍茶四萬餘公近，已由貿易局批准，將於明日直接運往紐的。</p>
<p>英糧食部採購　本年所需茶葉</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕糧食部頃宣佈：該部廖正進行購買聯合五國一九四七年份所需之茶葉。據稱關於錫蘭茶之購買，凡屬錫蘭茶商均有資格參加云。　　外銷紅茶活躍　昨成交九百餘箱　　　銷英國各地之大宗洋莊紅茶，連日因賣買雙方態度各自堅持，致交易缺乏。昨日在吐納談判再度展開下，忽豁然開朗。計由英商仁記洋行吸進卅四年份陳中祁門六十餘箱，價每担自五十四萬元至六十萬元。同時協和，怡和，錦隆，等洋行，共扒取卅五年度寗州紅茶八百六十四箱，價每担俱為六十一萬元。以上係安徽茶葉公司，及震和茶棧售出，市氣殊形堅定。他若抽珍，珍眉等綠茶，進出均有，過程活躍。至於各式內銷花色，本街店莊及蘇州帮雖猶擬添置，惜貨方不前，趨勢逐仍閑散。　　米市無變化　豆餅現貨軋升　　昨南北米市到源共計一萬二千四百石左右，市勢南市來貨稀寥，市形挺堅。北市厚粳來源尙多，價格平正。白元去化活靈挺升一二千元，秈米穩固之局。　　油市生油俏　，蔴油彷彿，淸油略緊，豆油見懈，鐵桶價昂，故桶油見升。豆餅汕頭船期已屆，急於待裝，軋現關系回漲千餘元。黃豆油廠採納，客帮動辦，重見轉挺，市勢趨堅。</p>
<p>麵粉下降千餘元，麩皮微升三五百元，勢則乍升乍降。蠶豆去化淸淡，回挫八九千元，綠豆南洋猛吸，飛漲萬餘元。赤豆胃呆低落三千元。紅糧萎靡不振，苞米靑島續動，形勢轉定。缸豆俏俐，生仁伕然呆滯，步削五六千元，不脫疲境。</p>
<p>漢口開出新鬃價　國外傳來緊俏聲</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕漢口猪鬃，自滬市前日開出新價後，漢口產地昨日亦開出新價，每箱為五百萬元，遙相呼應，頗有亦步亦趨之槪。昨市行商方面，以國外傳來好音，紐約行市俏升，且成交甚旺，市况趨緊，故一般心怯者精神為之一振。各業成交甚繁，市貨又轉緊俏。</p>
<p>較戰前少十之七　湘省桐油減產</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中國桐油之中心產區湖南，减產至為驚人，戰前湘產桐油年產為八百五十七萬担，現已减至六十萬祖，計减少百分之七十。浙皖產區使及戰前百分之廿，川區减少百分之五十，故各產區地方政府，對於戰後之植桐，非常重視。</p>
<p>又據某大出口商稱：最近各地桐油價格，已與紐約行市脫節，故紐約市况之高下，實亦無足輕重。現輸往歐洲英屬各地，每噸價為二百二十至二百四十英磅，而黑市外匯，以香港方面結匯易易，故最近紐約方面若不提高價格，勢必無法取得中國之桐油。　日來滬市桐油到貨，仍有小數接踵而至，市塲成交每日亦少，數量均在一二千担，成交價無桶四十六萬元，連桶四十八萬元。又據有關方面探悉：紐約桐油市况，頗為　淸，每磅巳跌至美金三角七分，尙無受主。</p>
<p>日用品下跌</p>
<p>邇來肥皂捲烟等日用品，因各廠紛紛出龍，致市上現貨充沛，各貨價格均趨下跌，昨日捲烟燭皂火柴市塲，交易不旺，一片喊賣，市勢甚為萎靡云。</p>
<p>皮毛出口業緊急會議　要求取消結匯期限</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕皮毛出口公會頃以出口貨期限及結匯兩間題，亟待籲請當局改善辦法，爰於昨日召開緊急會議，並決定下月三日推派代表，向中央銀行轍出推廣委會請願兩點：（一）關於出口貨結售外匯不得超過九十天一節，決請取消期限。（二）關於十一月七日以前啓運貨物，要求一律依現行法定匯率結售。</p>
<p>又訊：我國黃狼皮目前在美市價，每對的値美金三元。戰前皮貨年銷約一百六十萬張，而今年則僅及三十萬張。據該業業中人談：去年皮張輸出，的値美金一千餘萬元，而今年則因在蘇聯與澳洲競銷之下，致景况不佳，總數僅及去年之什一云。</p>
<p>工業貸款新趨勢</p>
<p>注重機動處理不作硬性規定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：四聯今後對於工業貸款，將根據工業之實際需要及物便情形，作機動之處理，而不作本年內擬貸款若干之硬性規定。去年一年內之貸款成績，正在愼密檢討之中。以本市而論，電力公司可望獲得貸款，淮南路礦有關公共福利，亦將續予協助。棉紡工業則因本身獲利已多，應有餘力自行擴充設備，故只允許押匯，以購買國棉；因此舉對於棉農，裨益甚多。至於其他一般工業之貸款，寨核將極端嚴格，對於申請工廠之歷史，過去貢獻，及廠主之立身行事等等，均將逐一考慮；新開之廠，原則上應自力更生。以借款之抵押而論，原料成品與機器廠房各搭數成，但並不規定比例，須視工業之性質而異，例如重工業，資產大部份為固定資本，故抵押品以機器廠房為主；反之，輕工業之固定設備甚少者，抵押品以原料成品為主體。</p>

<p>醫政論壇</p>
<h3>由醫師換證談到醫師法　並質詢最高衛生行政當局</h3>
<p>— 花新人</p>
<p>衛生署最近登報，舉行醫師及成藥從新登記換領執照。這種工作是很需要的。因為，我國究竟有多少醫師？連最高的衛生署恐怕都沒有一個正確的答案，這原因，當然是反映到衛生署對於醫藥管理的鬆懈。在人事上說這是表示着一種紊亂，在管理上說，是一種不科學。這種換領執照，內在還有一個自身的矛盲，那就是衛生署在過去沒有把握住醫師法所訂定的規條。同時，還有一個苦悶。就是過去的簽發執照證書，多少有點人情上的毛病。因此，現在就藉換領執照來彌補這缺陷。若果，現在能眞正的做得好，那也就是一種成功。因為亡羊補牢，還不算晚吧。</p>
<p>衛生署，是全國最高的衛生神經中樞。自民國十七年至現在，我國政府部門中，能有衛生的獨立機構，總算是當局特垂靑眼。可是，所表現的政績在那兒呢？瘟疫到處流行，死亡率是百分數的增加。衛生人員缺乏，縣級衛生人員更是濫竿充數。醫院設備不全，病床太少……這些，難道衛生當局，不承認是失敗麼？也許，衛生當局自認成功的地方，或者，更以為對今天的醫政建設有所貢獻的恐怕就是民國卅二年九月廿二日國府公佈的醫師法。實際言之，這個醫師法的結果，弄得醫政管理解體，分崩離析，更攪出一個五胡十六國的中西醫不平衡的局面。若果，我們加以科學的分析，這種法規祗能適合於戰時的組織。今天，衛生署，必須會感覺到。醫藥人才缺乏的嚴重性，公醫建設為什麼推不動？不在於從新登記換領證書加以統制。要做的事很多，而第一件，便是修正醫師法。按照現在的實情，和社會背景，及對中國人民眞正有助的地方，加以修正。換句話說，就是要將醫師法修正成為一個適用於中國的法規，不要好高務遠，不要緣木求魚，而要脚踏實地去看遠景，配合今天人民的需要，參照蔣主席的中國的命運中所指示的範圍，是擬訂一個好的醫師法否則，科學醫必然要垮台，衛生行政的政治壽命也必然要終結。</p>
<p>我國的醫師法規，第一次是在民國十八年一月十五日衛生部公佈的醫師暫行條例，計共五章廿五條，那時醫師資格的審查，是由衛生部組織審查委員會，審査給證。其中對於醫師資格之限制共分四項，除考試及格與在外國領有證書者外，最主要的是　年在廿歲以上，在國立或政府立案的私立醫學專門學校以上畢業領有畢業證書者。也許，當時，醫學院很少，畢業者寥寥可數，故有上面的規定。可是，對於中醫的領證却隻字未提，第二次，是在民國卅二年九月廿二日由國民政府公佈。這次公佈的醫師法，是正式的法規，因為牠經過了立法院的立法手績，交由行政院執行公佈的。這次的醫師法，計共六章四十條，將十八年公佈的總綱刪去了，將衛生部審查委員會修改為，「中華民國人民經醫師考試及格者，得充任醫師」，無形中，减弱了衛生署獨立審查權，間接也是給醫政機構一個打擊。同時，更加强了資格的限制。即關於醫師檢　考試由考試院會同行政院辦理。這意思就是說，醫師的證書，必定先要通過考試院，然後再由衛生署完成一下手續。這個醫師法，對於西醫是極盡嚴格管理之能事，而對於中醫却是卑躬屈膝的處處讓步。舉一個例吧，在醫師法第三條第一類的規定如：「曾向中央主管官署或省市政府領有合格證書，或行醫執照者」，但；我們要問，中央主管官署，或省市政府，憑什麽根據發給「合格證書」。「或行醫執照」？換句話說，這類「合格證書」和「行　執照」，又是依據那一條法規訂定的，我們以公民的身份，有權向衛生署控訴，責問，何謂「合格」，這種「合格的規定」，又是從什麼地方生根落足的？又如，第二款：在中醫醫學校修習醫學並經實習成績優良，得有畢業證書者。所謂中醫醫學校修習醫學，不知是否與西醫的規定（公女或經敎部立案者）相同？記得，去年敎育部曾訓令各省市取締不三不四的中醫學校，足見中醫學校辦理欠善，設施簡陋。試問，道種實習，是否能算成績優良？敎育當局能洞悉中醫敎育內情，為民族健康前途計，乃加以取締。這種處置是頗為適當的。但，當初，衛生署擬訂醫師法時，為什麽沒有想到這一點？是對西醫憎恨抑對中醫送禮？最荒謬的，莫過於醫師法第三條第三款訂定的：「曾執行中醫業務五年以上，卓著聲望者」，明顯的說，這硬是給科學醫的一種侮辱，一種摧殘，中醫行醫祗要「五年」，而西醫為什麽又不可呢？是否西醫的學理經騐趕不上中醫的科學？同時，「卓著聲望」更難給予一個界限，登報鳴謝，自吹自擂，是否就算卓著聲望？拉人介紹，又是是否算卓著聲望？稍通人情者，皆知這是變戲法的過門。够了，這一部戰時衛生署擬訂的醫師法，已是百分之百地證明了領導科學開倒車，徒然刺激中西醫之紛爭，紊亂了醫政制度。澈底的說，是完全失敗了。</p>
<p>醫字證書，總計可分四類，最早的是一種「特字」，領的人祗有幾個人，第二種是「醫字」，多半是正式醫學院畢業的，第三類是「通字」，就是在民十八年衛生部舉行考試之一種變通辦法及格的證書。第四類，是「甄字」，在戰時因須人念用，衛生署乃另想他法，將一些學歷不足者，徵調服務二年再發證書，因着有這四個字的分別，在醫界乃有淸白之區分，同樣的，更分了個「我上你下」。身份有了證明，選拔眞才也較容易。但，最近，衛生署，不顧原來政策，即一視同仁，發給統一醫字證書，這樣，將來勢必使整個的醫藥制度管理更加煩難。那就是，正式出身學歷資歷均足的科班醫師，和一些半路出家，投機取巧者在身份上怎樣去區分？難道正式醫學院畢業者，又願和一些無學歷享受同等待遇？因此，這次的換新執照，除增加人事上的糾紛外，實足的表示了衛生署的醫政是一種非科學的管理。這一點，我覺得醫師公會是當加以討論的。</p>
<p>因着醫師法的規定，窒息了科學醫藥的進行，目前，擺在衛生當局面前的一個嚴重事實，就是，在戰時，參加了服役，而有正式醫院以醫師委任，因學歷不符，而沒有領到醫師證書者頗不乏人，衛生署當如何處置以善其後？參加考試乎？這就是表示不承認資歷。但，為什麽戰時可以任醫師職位呢？是否是利用一下？最低限度，總比「行醫五年」，要「卓著聲望」？同時，這次的從新登記換照，衛生署並沒有指出參加「敵偽工作者」應如何處理？我們有點懷疑。偽組織的衛生署長呢？偽中央醫院院長呢？可是，我們不要忘了衛生界人士是有「氣節的呀」，參加八年的抗戰，臥薪嘗胆的生活。勝利後，實應與一些參加偽組織貪生怕死的奸醫之流，當有所區別。否則，我們怎樣對得住犧牲生命的醫藥界同志？要保全我們的「正氣」，奸醫決不能與我們為伍。</p>
<p>衛生行政當局，不能像駝鳥樣的把頭鑽進沙堆裏，逃避現實，而勇敢地正視現實。因為，我國同胞迫切需要的是一種實際的保健事業。巧妙的理論，動聽的計畫，掩蓋不住人民雪亮的眼睛。佛克林說：「一個人要克盡其公民的責任，第一是要能俎白地承認其責任上的錯誤」，因此，希望衛生當局，能知所改進，古語云，以直道使人雖勞不怨，物不平則鳴，這是作者撰著此文的本意。</p>
<p>編者按本文作者是一位比較前進的醫師也是在公共衛生機關裏供職的一位工作者。木文純客觀地對於醫師法之一部作一批評，眞是智者見智仁者見仁之論。尤其是在衛生署方面最近又頒佈了「醫事人員從新登記換領執照」的命令，則實有一讀之價値。因特刊登於此，並希海內醫界同仁共同加以討論。</p>
<h3>循環器的生理衛生（上篇）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>「循環」二字，照字面上說，就是住迴不息，周轉不停的意思。那末，這「循環器」，豈不就是體內往環不息，周轉不停的器官嗎？我們要向，在人體中，這往環不息，周轉不停的東西，究竟是什麼？牠是為誰在那裏這麽往環不息，周轉不停的呢？在人體中，日夜不息的周轉着，往環着的東西，說出來，大家都明白，就是「血液」。這項血液的局轉不息，往迴流動，是有一定的軌道的，這軌道，就呌做「血管」。所以血管裹的血，就好比河流裏頭的水。這類血管在體內又有動脈血管及毛細血管等等的分別。居留在這血管裏頭的血液，是替誰在那裏往環不息的流着動着呢？換句話說，就是牠的流着動着的工作任務是什麼呢？</p>
<p>肌肉的運動，是靠着拿取食物的滋養質和空氣中的養氣，來調換積聚於肌肉中的殘廢物質，這種工作，也有個學名，呌「新陳代謝」。但，主食物營養的器管是消化器，主交換空氣的器管，是肺臟一類的呼吸器，如果這中間沒有器管，在作相互聯絡，相互貫通的工作，那末，這肺臟中的空氣，這胃腸中的滋養物質，便沒有方法可以分配到全身中去，這血管中的血液的流着動着的循環任務，就是專在作着肺臟的交換空氣與胃腸的滋養物質到全身中去的一種聯絡工作，貫通工作。</p>
<p>我們再米打個比方來說說，這全身血液循環的工作情形，就好像一個國家的鐵路公路，一個國家靠着有作為交通的鐵道公路，才可以把東邊的物品，輸送到西邊，甫方的人馬搬運到北方；不然的話，如果一個國家沒有鐵道公路，便會感到交通的不方便。這個國家，尤其是在二十世紀的現代，便不成其為一個國家了。同樣地，人體中有血液循環這項工作，才能使體內物質營養有活動的工作，才能維持一個人的生活命脈；要是人體一日沒有這一項血液的循環工作，其結果，大家都很明白的，就得馬上壽終正寢的死掉。這理由，其實是粗淺到用不到我來說明的。</p>
<p>回頭，我們來說幾句這作為循環工作的主體的血液的話吧。</p>
<p>血液是佈滿於人體的任何部份的；所以任何部份的肌膚體的量的比例：普通成人的佔全體重十三分之一；初生的嬰兒比較多一點，大的佔十九分之一的樣子。血液的組成，由於液體的「血漿」和固體的「血球」。這固體的血球。分為「紅血球」和白血球」的兩種。白血球比紅血球大得許多，但數量沒有紅血球的那麼多：大約五百與一之比，就是五百個紅血球　頭，有一個白血球的樣子。這血白血球的壽命，都很短促：天約二十天的左右，就要死掉；老的血球死掉以後，再由血球的製造廠—骨髓，淋巴腺，脾臟等幾個廠家，陸續的製造出新生血球來補充來代替。</p>
<h3>用「斯脫來多滿新」治療　結核的檢討（二）</h3>
<p>— 楊士達</p>
<p>從五位尙生存的病人中，所感到最有興趣的一點，是其先前進行性的病症，已由「斯股來多滿新」所阻止，至少是暫時性的。其中一位祗患果粒狀結核無腦膜炎微兼的，經兩個月治療後，不輪臨床方或X光方面都有顯著的進步。其他四位患有顯著的腦膜炎徵象的包括日常　候（寒熱，昏迷，頭痛，頸柱强直）及脊髓液的病態並找着結核菌，皆能得「斯脫來多滿新」良好的效果。這種事實似可證明「斯脫來多滿新」有相當效力，不致有錯誤。從前H．Corwin　hinsc-haw氏曾用其他的藥物，試騐治療本症，從未發見這樣的效果。</p>
<p>徵候方面的减輕，大的經過一至二里期的治療，就可以發見；經過二至三星期，體溫漸退，從治擦開始，四至八星期後，體溫能復常態。同時病人感覺一般的舒適，昏迷，頭痛，項頸强直，也相繼消失，脊髓液方面的現象，病態的解除很緩慢，在治療期中，臨床徵候雖逐漸消失，可是脊髓液始終呈着多少不芷當的狀態。應曉氏所治的病人中，祗有二位的脊髓液幾乎恢復常態，但結核菌經過幾星期治療後，就絕跡，沒有方法證明牠的存在。這種脊髓液的病態，不能全部失消（細胞及蛋白量增多與糖貨呈减低）的事實，雖然用接種方法，也不能證明有結核菌的存在，當認為傳染尙有存在的可能。應　氏的五位病人中，三位已經六個月的治療，正在嚴密的觀察中，二位保持着良好的狀態已二個月及三個月，有一位在治療停止一個月後，病症復發，治療重新繼續進行。此病人自復發後，已多活二個月，由治療開始算起，已多活十個月。但是所有現今的痊態，仍舊不很可靠，再要經過長時間，在可列入這些病人為「痊愈者」。</p>
<p>神經系方面所遺留的病態，四個病人有腦膜炎徽象的，三個病人都有，一個成盲目，原因是結核性視神經炎，另一個成聾子，造成聾的原因，是否「斯脫來滿新」的關係，尙成問題，（因「斯脫來滿新」在聽覺器官方面常有副作用）第三個病人在小腦方面有深刻的病態。其餘的病人巳受五個月的治療，保持着良好狀態，能來門診治療。在治療之前，確是呈着嚴重的腦膜炎徽候。</p>
<p>Cooke氏及其合作者曾報吿用「斯脫來多滿新」使腦膜炎停止進行，尙其他六個同樣的報吿，私人曾提供與應曉氏。</p>
<p>應陳氏治療他的四位病人的方法，是用腰或或小腦延　池穿刺注射，　二十四小時或四十八小時注射一百至二百公　，約二至六星期。同時行肌肉注射，每日二至三公分，　績着六個星期。以後就加以長期的觀察。所有死亡的，都沒有受脊髓注射，所有受脊髓注射的，都沒有死亡。</p>
<p>在結核性腦膜炎的治療中，極　的「斯脫來滿新」都用肌肉與脊髓分途進長期注射，往往這樣的療法，臨床方面可以得到至少幾個星期或幾個月的効果。關於粟粒狀結核早期的診斷，與旅用極量的「斯脫來多滿新」山肌肉注射是必要的。臨床的，X光的與病理組織的痊愈，有可以得到的可能，但據應曉氏等治療經騐中，尙不能證實。關於別種結核型的治療結果，以後有機會再談吧！（未完）</p>
<h3>關於種牛痘幾種問題</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>有好幾位來信詢問關於接種牛痘的手術及其利弊的情形，我覺得很有加以總答覆的價値，所以在許許多多的來信中最先提出來答覆。而且外面的天花正在盛行，衛生當局又三令五申地去催促大家去種痘，那末這種工作也可以算是應時貨吧！</p>
<p>我們大家都曉得種牛痘是一種很稀鬆平常的事情，以為隨便種種是不要緊的。可是有些新做父母的讀者們總覺得不放心，不免要來問長問短，「幾時可以種牛痙」？「第一次牛痘是否在生下來之後就要種的？」「種了牛痘有什麽副作用？」「牛痘種過之後是不是可以預防其他一切的傳染病？」「種了牛痘之後要不要吃發的東西帮助牠的過程？」這些問題看來有些瑣碎，其實眞有道理。我今逐條答覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）「幾時可以種牛痘？」有許多醫師主張在生下來之後就得把小孩接種牛痘，以期預先防範天花的傳染。這種理由當然是對的。可是，我們應該明白，接種牛痘（尤其是第一次的種痙）並非是稀鬆平常的事情。從牠的接種的頭一天起一直到牠結痂脫落痊愈為止整整要經過十天或則半個月呢，而且，牠的第一次接種，簡直就像是敎小孩生了一次不大不小的不會致死的傳染病。如果小孩身體不康健，或則小孩身上已經有了病症，那末種牛痘是可以引起一種不良的意外呢。所以我得勸勸第一次做人父母的護者，如果你們的小孩要種牛痘，那末先要看看自己的小孩身體好不好。如果有傷風咳嗽或則腹瀉以及皮膚上患有濕疹等症，那末只有等待牠痊愈了才好接種的。否則徒然增加了小孩的負担，使他的病症加重或則使他容易發生其他病症。有人在息濕疹的小孩身上種牛痘，結果那個小孩全身都發濕疹及痘瘡危險極了，這是不可不知的。</p>
<p>（二）「第一次牛痘是否在生下來之後就要種的？」在德國的地方，他們的醫師都主張在小孩生下來後四個月以內絕對不種牛痘，一則因為小孩的本身得着母親方面傳來的免疫力量很少患着天花的病症，二則因為恐怕小孩的抵抗力太弱，不容易担負接種牛痘的一種艱苦工作。這種理由是相當合理的。不過，如果在某一區城內盛行着天花，那末這一區裏的小孩（除了病孩以外）就得全部種痘，不能再給他延緩了。</p>
<p>（三）「種了牛痘有什麼副作用？」在普通的牛痘的經過情形中，會有些發熱，不安及瀉洩，道是不足為奇的。在接種的地方有些紅腫及水泡，膿疱以及結痂，這都是正常的情形，不必顧慮。但是，如果接種牛痘之處腫漲異常，或則紅腫至於發紫黑色甚而至於化成很大的膿瘡，以及於發高熱之類，那就是不良的副作用了。牠多半是種痘時消毒不完全，因此傳染有別種毒菌（例如連鎖菌或葡萄菌之類）在內，必須延醫診治才好。</p>
<p>有些小孩在種牛痘後發生高熱及痙攣現象，這許是腦炎的症象，也必須延醫診治才好，因為牠是最危險的病症呢。</p>
<p>（四）「牛痘種過之後是不是可以預防其他一切的傳染病？」有許多人以為種了牛痘之後就可以防止其他的傳染病，這是絕對不可能的。可是，我得吿訴讀者，種牛痘雖然不能直接防止其他的傳染病，然而牠可以增强人身的免疫作用，因為經騐吿訴我們，種了牛痘之後，往往有許多小毛病是因此减少了的。</p>
<p>（五）「種了牛痘之後要不要吃發的東西」？在民間往往有一種習慣，在種了牛痘之後給予一種所謂「發」的東西希望牛痘可以早點發出來。其實這是多餘的，縱使吃了發的東西，也不見得就會早點發出來。我們沒有給他吃發的東西，結果往往也發得很好。所以這個發的東西是可以不必吃的。</p>
<p>不過，我得提一點來說明，或許因為以前的接種牛痘手術不完全，牛痘苗不純淨，或則因為種牛痘時有瀉洩現象，所以特地選出某些容易消化的食物來减輕小孩的負担吧。</p>
<p>關於牛痘的幾種問題，就此為止。</p>

<p>徒文化人的角度　看杭州　熊面對報者：州該文都　佛氏本記稱杭真是化城</p>
<p>春，效雖已為人發覺，早早悄悄地來臨到了西子湖濱，但她又故作嬌羞半掩半露若即若　起來。這幾天，她似乎再也耐不住了，顯出了淸麗可愛。漫天的好太陽披滿了湖而山谷，野花滿滿地開着，溫暖的風裏帶來了泥土的香味。溪流和，雀鳥合奏着「回春之曲」。</p>
<p>車，載來了從上海，蘇州，南京等地探春的男女們，戲劇家熊佛西先生和葉子小姐也適時來了。他們是來看看記者的，僅有一天半的逗留。我們便去三　印月玩水，白堤漫步，淨慈寺探聖，虎跑　泉，六和塔俯瞰錢江，並且也謁了岳王墳。為了梅，會去孤山，但效猶羞答答的不肯見人，浙大教授張君川兄說：「靈峯的梅花已開了。」於是我們又上靈峯去。它位於王泉寺的路上，我們趕急步行前進，繞過了小小的山坡，一抹翠竹露出了紅牆半角，拾級而登，進廟門左側，有一片小小的梅林，確已開放了數枝，芬芳佈滿着整個的庭園。</p>
<p>幾許文人　為西子傾倒</p>
<p>熊佛西先生對記者說：「杭州眞是太秀麗了，她應該是文化的都城。」是的，杭州眞該是文化的都城哪！她位置在滬杭綫上，每天有直達車金陵號上南京，她被錢江環抱，運河護衛，效是魚米之鄕，也是水菜的故里，她有良田與桑槐萬頃，她保持着質樸敦厚的風範。</p>
<p>幾許文人，曾為杭州的西子而拜倒。唐代的白居易，曾在這裹建堤灌漑水利，後人為紀念他，特在西子湖上建了一條白堤。唐末宋初的錢繆，他得湖山的靈秀之氣，在戰亂的時候，竟保持了兩浙的安全；至今錢公祠尚屹立湖濱，即是柳浪聞鶯的勝蹟處。宋代蘇軾在湖上築一蘇堤，春時六橋烟柳，風景宜人。林和靖在孤山放鶴，梅妻鶴子的故事也就產生在西子湖上，南宋時，詩妓蘇小小，她的香骨就埋葬在西泠橋邊，至今猶有很多人傾倒憑吊。宋時葛洪煉丹於葛嶺初陽台上，明時莊烈帝（即崇禎）寄居於西子湖邊，至今杭州的「朱大天君菩薩」香烟最為鼎盛，就是紀念他的意思。淸時俞曲園講學在蘇堤白堤之間，康有為曾逗留在小瀛洲三潭印月處，民國以來，蘇曼殊就葬在孤山脚下，吳昌碩等發起建立西泠印社於外西湖，秋瑾也葬在岳王墓畔，即是聞人葉楚傖先生，他臨終的遣囑，也是要卜葬於西子湖濱。</p>
<p>文風稱盛　如今殘敗了</p>
<p>在從前，杭州的文風也算稱盛，有崇文，敷文，紫陽書院，還有詁經精舍考古，孝廉堂論文章，即現在省立圖書館保藏的四庫全書，也是很多有毅力的人在西子湖上抄繕成就的。</p>
<p>杭州，她在歷史上是文物之邦，現在她的內容，反感到凋零殘敗。有人說：「這是政治的因素。」又有人說：「這是景物太柔麗，使人缺乏了開拓的勇氣。」我曾為此事與熊佛西先生等討論良久，所得的結論：政治與景物都不是重要的因素。杭州，還是可以作為中國的文化的都城的。因為效安靜，適宜於文入的寫作，她秀麗，沒有市俗之氣，她交通便利，可以溝通外面的一切文化。並且杭州市有數十家的印刷所，雖然印刷技巧不如上海高明，但如果眞的文化人留住在杭州，經過他們的指導，也許會凌駕上海而上之的。同時杭州生活費用雖然也一般的高，但由於市民的淳樸，開支常比上海省得多，房屋雖也鬧恐慌，其程度也比上海輕得多。她是一個大公園，閒來無事，可以盪舟湖上，或是漫步堤邊。貧窮而又淸高的文化人士，他們雅愛自然，需要精神的慰藉，應該以杭州作為他們自已的家園。</p>
<p>學術機構　盼大量移設</p>
<p>熊先生因着我們誠摯的熱情，他將於仲春時節率領他劇校的同學來杭州作一度公演屆時他還想的文化界一些知名之士到杭州來。這當然不過是一種文化的活動而已。距離建設為文化都城，正還有着漫長的路途。但是，我們必須這樣熱烈的企盼淸，我們必須這樣熱烈的呼喊着，由於我們的企盼呼喊，我們相信一定會激起人家的注意的。</p>
<p>我們還希望領導全國。領導浙江，領導杭州的人士們，必須要透視杭州在文化價値上的地位，我們認為，建設為花園都市是不够的，建設為東方好萊塢也是不够的，應該建設為文化的城市，在這一方面，拼命努力才使杭州能够充實飽滿，使人留戀不忍離去。因此，國家要建立的許多新的學術機構，應該設在杭州，許多名義上沒有地域區別的學府，應該遷到杭州來，甚至最近要設置的鑼斯福圖書館，我們也有請求常局加以移設杭州的考慮之必要。</p>
<p>舉目全國，北平本來有文化城之稱的，但這是在北方，而且當時因為政治建都的關係，才使文士薈萃於此。現在，北平很多文人都到東南來了，他們侷促在事子間　籠式的房屋中，每天飽吸煤灰，聽熟了經紀人的算盤　。他們的思想領城是被一家生計困纏得透不過氣來。他們即使有偉大的抱負與偉大的寫作，也被現實環境所限制住了。</p>
<p>文化人士是人類靈魂的工程師，也是國家皇冠上的寳石，我們要珍視他們，我們要選　良好的地方，為他們佈置家園。</p>
<p>浙贛鐵路　修復工程近況　十七日婺源訊</p>
<p>浙贛路全長一〇〇八里，連南潯綫共長一一三〇公里，在戰時僅有上饒，江山一段可勉通車，勝利後杭州至該暨一段，已接收通車。全綫百分之八十，還未修復，此項修復工程，前經交部核准，先修金華至該暨，株州至萍鄉，僅成三分之一，前撥的經費，已竭不敷，並續請追加預算。</p>
<p>修復該路所需主要物資是列車，鐵軌，枕木，三項，列車一項，將由津浦路拔運來贛，其工程進行步驟，先興修株萍，南潯，諸金三段，曲綫過速及不利行車的路面，均予改修，至橋樑涵洞，則儘先利用原有基礎。</p>
<p>聯總駐華辦事處，為協助修腹浙贛路，須先行勘察全綫路面，俾明實况，該處工業善後工程師何益爾（K．V．Hoyer）等，已擬訂善後計畫，由該處協助修復，如材料工程供應不缺，可望於年內完成全錢通車。（寗頗）</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>述貓篇</h3>
<p>— 鳴春</p>
<p>二月七日，我在某報讀到一篇「貓的故事」，有獲悉闊別多年老友消息的歡喜。可惜內容全屬洋貓故事，如什麼拿破崙恨貓，威靈頓愛貓之類；美中不足的，那文中還保留了些連英文字典總找不到的生字。我是愛過這小畜生的，讓我談談我所知道的貓故事吧。</p>
<p>討經有云：一有虎有貓。」這畜生和中國人發生關係頗有悠久歷史。說也奇怪，「馬牛羊鵝犬豕」的六畜，貓不與焉。而王充曾討論過的子鼠，丑牛，寅虎，卯兎……的十二屬，又沒有她的地位。所以我們沒有屬貓的人。不但此也，「鷄犬不寗，」說明被憐憫的對象無貓。一聲色犬馬一，說明被寵愛的對象無貓。　固不能與龍虎爭雄，但十二生肖反有可惡之鼠，可怕之蛇，可憐之豬的地位，而獨無貓，未免冤屈。若說貓之有無，無關人生，只要想像她們來個半年總請假，那猖在的老鼠豈僅將在你的枕畔玩著捉迷藏而已？</p>
<p>淸儒劉獻廷謂仙佛鬼神運氣，也有幸與不幸，認為理不可解，尚不知畜類命運亦復如此也。</p>
<p>貓確實能與人發生感情，但絕不如忠實走狗的一步一趨，聽人頤指氣使。所以世多義犬而少義貓。她們個性倔強，酷愛自由，捕鼠工作，半田興趣。往往食主人之飯，捕鄰家之鼠。美於人類的自私觀點，所以難討主子的歡心了。</p>
<p>許多貓和我發生過感情。我容許她們睡在我的榻旁「念經」。我常把手指伸入她們的嘴裏，讓她們儘量咬，她們蹲着，仰著，坐着，咬出各種方式，可是她們所用的力量，輕重適度，齒鋒從未刺入我的皮膚，她們也讓我撫摸舌上的細刺。</p>
<p>她們是可以訓練的。一次，我在水鄉散步，發現湖邊上泊了一艘江湖賣藝的船，船頭上立着一隻美麗的花貓。我問船主人：「你們有時船泊水，貓子的大小便不是難題嗎？」船主人得意的指着船梢後掛著的一隻大毛竹筒子道：「那就是貓子的厠所。」他按着說：「貓子在船上決不隨地大小便，總歸上她專用的厠所，從不有誤，這是經過長期訓練的結果。」又一次，我在一座有名的富庶的尼庵裏吃素席，客人尚未入座，一隻小花貓，突然躍上桌角，聲色不動，痴坐着凝視桌上的食碟，並不前進一步，大有特來參觀神氣。我從碟中取了一塊花生糖贈送，她便在桌角文雅的吃下。「二珠，唔，好了，下來！」一個尼姑喊着她的名字，她果然應聲蹤下。</p>
<p>這尼庵的貓，統有名字、尼姑們能隨便呼喚某一隻貓做某種動作。譬如說，「三實，上我的肩頭，」那呌三實的就一躍而上了呼喚者的肩頭了。</p>
<p>還有個特點，這尼庵的貓子全是茹素的。</p>
<p>白居易說得好，「物情小可戀。」眞的，一切動物，迎人在內，幼小時期，總是可愛。貓在不會捕鼠以前，最愛遊戲，她能向階下搖風的一朵殘花，迂廻捕捉，七擒七縱，繼續跳盪一小時以上。可惜一會捕鼠，就遊興全懶，正如一個孩子長到懂事年齡，另起慾望，就不願意為遊戲而遊戲了。</p>
<p>我觀察過很多貓的天性，發覺她們和人類一樣，也有天賦腎愚之分。有的生性貪得，不守本分。合食的時候，毫無禮貌，連前足都一齊爬進食盆，拚命擠軋，呌同伴無法插入。甚至攫走了飯裏的拌魚，閃躱到書案下，獨自大嚼，嘴裏還鳴鳴示威，強呌別的貓莫近飯碗。那樣子比希特拉還要帝國主義。有的貓吃品很好，愛乾净，不搶食，頗有紳士風度。</p>
<p>貓子好鬥，尤其殘冬臘底，往往為性愛吃醋，鬥得毛飛皮破，兩敗俱傷。她們不共戴天，死硬到底，不像人類打打和和。有的貓因與別的貓子隔絕，自成勢力範圍，相遇即生疑忌，往往惹起鬥爭。推知人類與外界少接觸的民族，是不祥的現象。</p>
<p>貓也注重血親感情，但子女一能單獨生活，即互不聞問，頗類工業社會的家庭制度。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，愈好看的如三色的獅子貓之類愈不能捕鼠。這與人世問體面的「公僕」或「花瓶」之不能担任繁劇正復相同。</p>
<p>貓捕鼠的技巧，大有不同，人類有「刻舟求劍」的笨伯，也有「守穴待鼠」的痴貓。神氣的貓，能在一丈以外，監視跳梁的醜類，只消挺直的尾巴，悄悄　幾個圈兒，再作縮身欲躍姿態，那老鼠就嚇昏自墜了。其道理頗類強國的軍事大操演。</p>
<p>親親而仁民，仁民而愛物，養貓消遣，兼用捕鼠，本是一舉兩得。可嘆據亂時代，人們自身的生存都感威脅，眼看世人，都漸已視親人如路人，視百姓如草芥，犬貓異類，久在關心的圈子以外了。</p>

<h3>憶念</h3>
<p>— 尹雪曼</p>
<p>一九三八年夏天，我逗留在陝南的一個小城裏。這個小城因為是夾在秦嶺與巴山之間，所以氣候很有點像江南。在六七月，忽陰忽晴的日子，是常有的。但是像我們這羣無覊而放蕩的年靑人，誰又有心情肯在這上而打算呢。因此，在出門不到一刻，我就挨到傾盆的大雨，雖然躲在人家屋簷下，却仍不免淋得像一隻落湯鷄。</p>
<p>記不淸是為了什麼，我需要到校長家裏走一趟。這時，雖然我不曾考慮模樣和禮貌，而毅然大踏步地來進一條巷子裏，却不料當我快到校長門前時，我却被突然的模樣和禮貌問題給擋住了。</p>
<p>在濛濛的細雨中，前面走着兩個美麗的背影，雖然她們的面貌和頭髮，都影在紫色的小雨傘下，可是我卻能够推斷出，她倆是美麗的。尤其是那件绛紅色旗袍，更給我無限的吸引。</p>
<p>我望見她們站在一家門前了，這門正是老校長家的門。</p>
<p>嗒塔…………</p>
<p>敲門聲使我站住了，我望望自己，望望她們，於是毫不猶疑地，轉身逃出那條深巷。</p>
<p>一直到三九年春天，我才又有機會碰見她，那穿絳紅色旗袍的姑娘，她是我同學×底妹妹。×介紹我們相識，我便提起三八年夏天那一幕。她說：</p>
<p>「是嗎？我眞不曉得！否則倒要欣賞欣賞尊容」。</p>
<p>好厲害的嘴！我心裏說。險上却還向她笑了笑。</p>
<p>那一次，是我們初决相識。</p>
<p>此後時光帶走五個春天。五個春天裏我們不曾相忘。卻不料當第六個春天來時，我卻都做了父母。</p>
<p>是有些什麽感慨嗎？年紀靑靑的，感慨自然是不應該有。但如果說一個人，對過去竟毫無眷戀和憶念，那亦不是不近情理嗎</p>
<p>因此，使我想到理想和現實，是怎樣不同的兩回事。</p>
<p>年靑的孩子們，誰沒有理想呢？但錯誤的却不是我們，雖然我們沒有把理想建築在現實上。同於理想和現實相距太遠了，結果不免使理想成為幻想，但想想看，幻想會帶給我們多大創傷呢</p>
<p>過去，我們曾在月色皎潔的夜晚，畫山我們理想的美圖。但可悲的是這個社會，竟然拒絕理想畫出的美國！使理想和生命成為相尅之物，因此貪戀生命的人，結局總是相同的，那便是把理想的美國，摔在現實的塵埃中，讓它　封和粉碎！</p>
<p>她是先我離開那座使人迷惑，亦使人厭倦的小城。那時正是四〇年的夏天，槐花餘香還飄留在靑色原野裏的時候。分離雖使我們黯然神傷，但因為要追求那一點點，帶着濃厚幻想色彩的希望，我們終於含着眼淚，笑着握手，互道珍重，便在塵埃蔽天的公路上分別了。</p>
<p>但正像一篇傳奇式小說所描述的一樣，她的經過是一篇動人的故事。戰爭使效獻出無比的熱情，使她逃出溫馨的家庭，加入一羣年靑人組織的工作隊，餐風宿露，嚐到多少夢想不到的苦頭。但長後却不料又受到迎頭打擊！工作隊因無人支持，經濟枯拮而解散了；她只好帶着一顆創傷的心，來到後方這個小城。</p>
<p>我永遠懷念那一羣年靑人，她帶著沈思和回憶的音調，低低地說：「他們年靑，熱情，勇敢而可愛；但是社會卻不要他們！」</p>
<p>我默默無語的倚在她的身邊，悵望着夜空。</p>
<p>「將來」，她忽的一把抓住我，大聲地說。「喂，你怎麽啦？」</p>
<p>我望她笑笑，她又繼續說下去。「我想到鄉下教書去，做些切切實實的事，你說呢？」她說罷愉快地望着我。</p>
<p>「我就是鄉間長大的，鄉裏的人飯都沒得吃，那有功夫來讀書。」</p>
<p>「有辦法」，她充滿自信地說：「一邊工作一邊讀書呀！我希望以小規模的化學工業，來支持我的計劃。」</p>
<p>「你眞的要如此作嗎？」我有點不敢盡信。</p>
<p>忽的，我看到她的臉色變了，她氣冲沖地說：「你還不相信我」？說過，她一把推開我，不顧一切地跑走了。</p>
<p>比起從前，我們今天目然堅實得多了。不是嗎，一個年靑人在起初是只有無限的熟情，像任何一個人一樣，社會的折磨，會使他逐漸堅實起來，不再像以前那麽空洞。但是當六年後的今日，我們偶然在街頭相遇，驚悉大家都作了父得，相對啞然的時候，想一想那些月夜，那些淸談，不都像夢一樣的渺茫和幽隔嗎？</p>
<p>怪誰呢，目己的毅力不够，志向不堅嗎？還是怪從前不該那麽傻裏傻氣地，描出自己的理想圖畫；致使今天啞然相對，臉色漲得飛紅呢？</p>
<p>「你看，我老了吧？她說</p>
<p>我笑笑。「還年靑得很！」</p>
<p>她狠狠地瞪我一限。「瞧我的孩子都多大了呢？」</p>
<p>「那麽，瞧他們吧！」我摸摸她孩子的頭。</p>
<h3>惠特曼手冊</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>新近艾藍（Gay　Wllson　Allen）出版了一本「惠特曼手册」（Walt　Whitman　Handbook）。現在連美國本國，恐怕讀惠特曼詩的人都很少，家庭中藏有惠特曼「草　集」的人就不多。愛倫坡甚至愛瑪生的詩都有人重印，惟獨惠特曼只有選家偶然選錄幾首。</p>
<p>自然，他是應該列入名作家之林的。但除了熱情的住事子間的靑年喜愛他的詩以外，誰還肯去讀它呢！只有作曲家還採用他的詩來歌唱，大學詩選班上還讀到他的詩。</p>
<p>艾藍在這惠特曼手册中提起，惠特曼實是世界的詩人，他對於各國的影響很大，無論英法德俄南美的詩人都受他的影響。他在美國以外的聲譽是與哥德，囂俄或托爾斯泰相等的。法國的象徵主義者也祟拜他。紀德感謝他拯救了他的精神分裂，使他感到一切創造的合一。在德國第一次大戰前，惠特曼幾成為文化界的偶像。托馬斯曼一九二〇年說他的作品受了叔本華和尼采的影響。</p>
<p>將惠特曼與羅賽諦，史文朋對比，大家是都知道的。像陶登和散芝巴里也稱讚惠特曼，人家就想不到了。王爾，羅曼和紀德的稱頭也是可理解的，至於拉弗格，杜哈美爾之類也是惠特曼派，就誰也想不到了。</p>
<p>昨第六章「惠特曼與世界文學」寫得最好，其餘五章亦可讀。參考書極多；名為手册，價值實在手册之上。從一八六六年的阿康諾（Oconnor）起，到一九四三年的堪員（Canby）止，所有的傳記他都搜集了來作一比較。他還譯用了丹麥作家許倍格（Frederik　Schyberg）的評論，經他第一次介紹過來，尤覺名貴。他還採用了不少的草葉集的版本，直到一八八二年的第七版為止。</p>
<p>艾藍對於惠特曼的基本觀念和社會思想也有叙述，不過他很當心，不讓他思想家的叙述占的篇幅過多。他把惠特曼寫成許多力量的總和，這就是無論唯物論者，理想家，自然主義者，國家主義者，社會主義者，象徵主義者全都讚美他的原故了。他鼓動他人的愉悅和勇敢。</p>
<p>在韻律方面，惠特曼跟隨十九世紀的作家，實騐有機的韻律，如安諾德，丁尼生等人所當試的一樣。他的詩，如白拉德萊（Bradley）所示，節奏是諧和的，不像近來目由詩那樣的過於放縱有好多方法這是從聖經學來的。較長的詩甚至用到歌劇的手法，幾乎他目己成了一個作曲家。艾藍論惠特曼的技巧一章也寫得不壤。可惜有兩點被艾藍忽略了：其一是象徵，又其一是想像。</p>
<h3>雙玉軒詞賸</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>人物菰產裏，山河角鼓中；好吟梁甫莫書空，眼底嫣紅柔綠是春風。衷曲惺惺惜，行藏種種同，離愁不似水流東。為問月圓幾度更相逢？</p>
<p>一斛珠</p>
<p>枕邊閑覷晨曦，漸向窗懦聚，今朝風雨應無據；檢點奚囊，收拾春遊句。酤酒漫尋溪畔路，春波碧過前時渡，水田漠漢飛鷗鷺；我也忘歸，不醉母歸去。</p>
<p>生查子</p>
<p>風露望中宵，朝日驅昏夜，多少惜春人，縱浪光天下。閑覓舊遊踪，景色都如畫，楊柳漫婆娑，處處忘言者。</p>
<p>眼兒媚</p>
<p>梧桐秋老點棲鴉，冷月浸黃花；夜闌不寐，東離延佇，可奈芳華！　艱難苦恨繁霜髮，，無賴是悲笳；春風幾日，江南又綠，綠到天涯。</p>
<p>鷓鴣天用稼軒韻</p>
<p>一疊淸波一疊愁，却教別後憶溫柔，錦鱗潛隱無消息，漫指天南海北頭。金鼓震，幾時休，相思都付最高樓，扁舟也欲尋芳躅，水遠山長不自由。</p>
<h3>孔雀</h3>
<p>— 張書旂</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血185</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>命令剛剛頒佈完畢，各小組的領袖，逐漸退出，只賸有一兩位担任臨時「突　」負責調度的工作者，還有一點計設的當口，忽然看見門一開，一位當值突地進來，報告「來客請見」，正說着姓名，只見鶴見，已經匆匆跨進了房門，舉動沒有平日那麽安祥，並且面容蒼白；</p>
<p>「失禮得很……」見的字音裏，帶著很濃厚的日本語腔調。這是人在勿忙皇遽中。當有的現象——神思不屬，把外鄉語調，臨時弄得三不像——僅僅說了這四個字，一眼看見座上有兩位特別打眼的人物，立刻把要說的話，又嚥下去了。　　W君何等機警，察言觀色，他早知道鶴見如此匆遽，必是局勢有變，也知道鶴見為何把話嚥下，當即把部下那兩位同志，打發出去，一面對鶴見和我們幾個人，笑着點頭：</p>
<p>「給您幾位介紹一下……」</p>
<p>那坐在一邊，似乎是來賓的兩位，立刻站了起來；我們連鶴見四人，也走上前兩步。W君用手虛邀着一位身量較矮的，對我們說：</p>
<p>「敝局總主任——戴先生！」</p>
<p>這叫我們都大吃了一驚。戴先生的聲望，在我們一羣人中，可說如當貫耳。他的行動，一直是如神龍一般，變化莫測；這時明明含著微笑，站在我們面前，我却元自有些信不過似的。</p>
<p>「這一位是戴先生的英文秘書馬先生。」W君介紹了另外一位身量較高的來客。</p>
<p>我們每個人都同兩位互相握手問好，W君也把我們的姓名都說明了。</p>
<p>「虛奪我們都免了罷，古先生似乎有芷事商量，請照常進行。」</p>
<p>戴先生除了會議和報告之外，普通塲面上，少有一氣速說三句話的時候，這是W君後來閒談時告訴我的。</p>
<p>他雖不愛交際應酬上的白捺，甚至在某種會議塲上，始終一言不發，但您如留心的話，他却時時在傳遞他的思想。在必要時的時候，他那精光閃爍的眼睛也會「說話」，手一揮，頭一側，甚至完全的沉默，都是一種無聲的言語。</p>
<p>沉默的人，我也見過很多很多，那僅僅是一些光天的冷靜，或後天的乖巧；他們給人的印象，只是一種沉悶，叫人惑覺得異常不敢親近，這些人，嚴酷些評判起來，只能說他們是孤僻，或能說話的啞吧。</p>
<p>戴先生却不然；他雖不多說話，但在人羣之中您一點也不曾覺得他冷靜；反之，他很熱鬧；因為代表他發揮或傳達他的思想的工具，雖不是言語，却是多方面的示意。他雖不發聲，却已答覆了你的問題。對於你的意見，他或贊成，或不接受，只用眼睛一瞬，或有意義的看了你一眼，你就能明白，比較總了長篇大論的解釋還要淸楚明白。他有時吐出了一個字，或兩三個字組織的短句，就可把你心事需要說而說不淸楚的要點，開門見山似的一語中的。</p>

<h3>少年立志</h3>
<p>— 梅白</p>
<p>京戲中有一齣「少年立志」，其實就是「投軍別　」的別名，薛平貴和孔門高弟顏回的志趣大不相同，不甘再在寒　中過清苦的生活，於是就毅然和年輕美麗的太太告別，出去當兵，結果是衣錦回鄉，大團圓。</p>
<p>現在的少年們倒也着實志不在小。孔夫子長十有五而志於「學」，現在的少年們的志氣，却與孔夫子不同——和學問毫無關聯。</p>
<p>他們的「志」是什麼呢？君不見中正大學生們打傷了校長蕭　，而一向以出產「文　　生」著名的蘇州，也有大隊中學生，浩浩蕩蕩地搗毀了「蘇報」館嗎？</p>
<p>故曰：現在的少年志於「打」！此亦時代進步之一例也。</p>
<h3>剩餘之剩餘</h3>
<p>— 雷克</p>
<p>自從勝利以來，我是一個大量購食美軍剩餘罐頭食品的人，沒有別的什麽理由，祗是為了經濟。</p>
<p>剩餘這名稱自然不大好聽，正像穿了人家的舊襯衫，或者吃了人家的「飯脚水」一樣。然而我們就是這樣一個用舊貨，玩骨董，講國粹的國家，用用人家的剩餘大概也不增加羞恥。</p>
<p>多年以前，曾經有人報導過，說上海有些人買了外國輪船上吃剩下來的殘羹冷菜，重新興成西餐出售。可是這種消息並不阻止我上小餐館去，也不阻止其他的同胞，我們需要這樣的廉價。我們要生活，就像垃圾桶裏的老鼠，和那些翻檢垃圾的大小叫化</p>
<p>最近的新聞，說聯總所購得的霉壞物品，在傾倒海中的時候，被人偷去在市塲上公開出賣了。這種剩餘物資之剩餘，據說食之有毒，當然是危險的東西。可是直到現在為止，我從未中斷康價罐頭食物的購買。我差不多天天要像老鼠一樣孤寂而貪婪地吃着這些罐頭食物，吃剩了丟在牆角裏，讓貓和老鼠再吃。直到現在，我還沒有中過毒，也沒看見那頭貓打過一個　噁，至於老鼠的屍體，也沒有見過一只。</p>
<p>我們大概都已經有一個消毒的胃了，正像能吃蜈蚣。蜘蛛的</p>
<p>在我的記憶裏面，曾經有兩個人送過我「剩餘」的東西，一個是一瓶凝結如鐵的什麽「麥精」之類，一個是上面開了一片綠花的兩塊高橋鬆餅。前者我無法吃得動。後者那一層綠花使我見了害怕。結果是一個進了收舊貨的手裏，一個在窗檻上晒了許多日子的太陽，被原送的人收回去了，至今我想想，懊惱當時沒有吃下肚去，我並不怪那兩個好意的人，因為他們本來都是吃人剩餘的同胞，焉知那兩樣東西不也是剩餘之剩餘呢？</p>
<h3>百尺樓</h3>

<p>昔日漢奸常，今日忠監住，歡動高樓設備佳，賽過居公寓！</p>
<p>只要有才能，不要愁工作，多少人隨勝利還，失業無居處！</p>
<p>註：滬市漢奸將給予工作，及移居六層樓的新看守所，均見近幾日本報新問。</p>
<p>蒙赦後的罪犯</p>
<p>赦出苦飢寒，跌進成貪愛，不自由還可惡生，犯罪何妨再！</p>
<p>判決不容情，作孽蒙優待；不見洋房設備全，逆賊心歡快？</p>
<p>註：滬語入獄叫跌進去。</p>
<h3>聽戲與看戲</h3>
<p>— 松</p>
<p>北人曰聽戲，南人曰看戲。余以為必聲容並茂，方是好戲，耳目二官，何偏廢其一。京朝派講究聽戲者，不登樓座，不入池座，惟靠大牆而坐，瞑目靜聽，推為最上乘。所謂大牆者，乃樓下兩廊最後一排，距上下塲最近之座，伊等或只聽某一人，或只聽某一戲，甚至只聽某戲之某一段；生角如「洪羊洞」之自那日，「昭關」「捉放」之一輪明月，「汾河灣」「武家坡」之　前，「探母」之坐宮，「空城」之城頭；旦角如玉堂春，祭江，祭塔，六月雪等戲，皆擇其最精彩之一段，聽畢即掉頭不顧而去。同日同塲，雖有其他佳劇，必　聽也。</p>
<p>其次一等則必坐上下塲之小池子，樓上上下塲之第三官，此等地位，往往有人包去，或戲院為大勢力者留定。山東館之大飯莊如某堂某居，亦能代定。若靠大牆，則不必要此處榮架子，隨到隨坐，來得最晚，走得最早，凡坐正面樓官座，及兩廂其他樓座，皆老土也。惟正面樓正中一間，乃留備都察院之總副憲，及五城中之南城巡城御史，或請客，或自用，是日上午，不遺紀綱交派，亦可售出，非如近日京津之樓下正面最後一排，必有警察座也。京曹官及子弟老於京師，號稱戲迷者，必親聽兼用，亦不，染都市聽戲習氣，入池座後排，為最多數。余性嗜戲，必坐正中最前池座，到院最晚，到座最佳，其實無他謬巧，不過對於看坐老，（即上海劇塲之案目）不惜小費耳。友人詫以為奇，有效予所為者，乃不能如予之得法，董先君任副憲總憲為時甚久，院方亦特別優待。社會無時無地，不有內幕，區區觀劇小事尚如此，可勝歎哉。</p>
<h3>新論語</h3>
<p>— 袁琴孫</p>
<p>子曰：非利勿視，非利勿聽，非利勿言，非利勿動。（而今之世，惟利是圖）。</p>
<p>子曰：放於利而不行，多怨。（高利貸，放拆息，有本利不還者，焉得不怨？）</p>
<p>子之燕居，伸伸如也，縮縮如也。（房荒時期，祗能鴿龍內縮縮也。）</p>
<p>子貢曰：有黃金於斯，求善賈而沽諸，子曰沽之哉，沽之哉，我待沽者也。（中行收金僅四十八萬，藏金者，不得善價而沽矣。）</p>
<p>子譾：黨存，不讓於師。（大學罷課風潮，復毆校長，學生亦存黨派之意見也。）</p>

<h3>邱吉爾和鯉魚</h3>
<p>— 陳湘</p>
<p>當法國淪陷之後，在這個戰敗的國度中，充滿著希望的人民，竊竊的遍傳着一個有意義的寓言。這個寓言的「英雄氣概」的幽默，證明法國人對海峽隔岸的頑固的人民，對他們最後解放的深切寄予信仰這則寓言說：</p>
<p>在一九四〇年的七月，當英國正在單獨抗戰時，希特勒邀請邱吉爾到巴黎來開秘密會議。邱吉爾乘飛機到達巴黎後，就被護送到封騰布羅保，在那裏，希特勒利墨索里尼圍着茶桌等著他，茶桌剛好擺在聞名的鯉魚塘的旁邊。</p>
<p>希特勒毫不浪費時間：「這裏就是我要對你說話的地方，邱吉爾！英國是完了。簽署這張和約，承認英國已經戰敗了罷，整個的歐洲明天就可以獲得和平了。」</p>
<p>「我抱歉，我不能夠簽字。」邱吉爾安靜的回答說：「我不同意我們已經戰敗了。」</p>
<p>「可笑！」希特勒拍着桌子怒吼了，「看看顯明的事實！」</p>
<p>邱吉爾啜著他的茶。「在英國」，他說，「我們對於歧異的意見，時常以打贈來解決。你願意和我賭一下子嗎？輸的人要同意；他戰敗了。」</p>
<p>「怎麽賭法呢？「希特勒疑惑的問。</p>
<p>「你看到池塘裏的那些大鯉魚嗎？好，就讓我們賭：誰第一個不用任何通常捕魚的器具而捕獲一尾鯉魚的，他就是戰爭的勝利者。</p>
<p>「賭一下！」希特勒噘叫地說，他急速的拔出一把連發手槍，朝著最近的鯉魚迎續射擊」，手槍空了，但是塘水使搶彈偏折，鯉魚未受驚擾的繼續游泳着。</p>
<p>「輪到你了，老墨！」希特勒咆哮起來，「他們對我競：你是一個大游泳家！你跳下去！」</p>
<p>墨索里尼脫下了他的衣服，跳入池塘，但是他一捉住鯉魚，鯉魚就從他的掌握中滑了出去。最後，他筋疲力竭，喧噪著帶了一雙空手爬了上來。</p>
<p>「輪到你了，邱吉爾！」希特勒咬牙切齒的說，「讓我們看看，你怎麽做法！」</p>
<p>邱吉爾平靜的將他的茶匙伸入池塘，盛起一茶匙塘水，曰個來，越過他的肩膀向後　　　。他重覆繼續的這樣做着。</p>
<p>希特勒張着嘴瞧着，「你在地上幹什麼？」他不能忍耐的問</p>
<p>「這需要一個長時間。」邱吉爾看着盛水回答說，「但是我們正在進行打勝仗！」</p>
<h3>賣文杞憂</h3>
<p>— 魯思齊</p>
<p>賣文本來是件苦事，特別是今天。舊年後物價像旋風似的往上漲，可是賣文人的唯一進款；稿費，部屹然不動！所以，我常對我的老婆說：「幾時物價能像稿費價格那樣穩定，你就可以不必發愁日子難過了！」</p>
<p>前兩天詩人臧克家先生，為了增稿費的問題，曾寫過一篇吶喊似的文章，編輯先生也很凑趣，寫了幾個字的按語，說是應該加二成。</p>
<p>其實加二成也幷不算多，就拿稿紙說吧，兩三個禮拜以前，一千多元四十張的稿紙，規在居然漲到五千多了。其他如賣文人離不開的墨水，香烟，筆……無一不在漲價，而且都漲得相常兇</p>
<p>若照物價的比例來說，稿費加二成確是公道的要求。可是就連這樣公道的要求，也不知道何年何月才可以實現。</p>
<p>物價高，稿費低，固然是賣文人的厄運，但，目前，　文人最大的厄運還不單獨是稿費的間題，而是，報紙篇幅緊縮，雜誌停刊，書店老悶不接受稿件……。假如出版界常此下去，即使稿費增高了，我們的厄運依然沒有解除。</p>
<p>我是個　文人，當我希望提高稿費，而且越高越好。可是，假如我們的文章的出路越來越狹，甚至於根本斷了出路，連最低的稿費都拿不到的時候，那才是賣文人的最大厄運呢。</p>
<h3>又一勇士　——記見義勇為迪克生</h3>
<p>— 丁安康</p>
<p>憶「呂宋小姐」號飛機失事後，各報咸競載多情舞女李素蘭照片，以其搶救同行受傷舞客羅君，不幸本人慘遭滅頂，其情節亦壯烈亦香艷也。頃有友人盛樹珩君，亦該機乘客之一，昨自馬尼刺脫險返申，據談：該機失事後，機中一片呼救聲，幸乘客中有美籍海員迪克生者，見狀一躍入水，發揮其博愛精神，不問國籍，不分男女，先助各人登橡皮救生艇，計獲救者運迪氏共二十人，然後將三艇用繩索連連之，但以各人不諳打氣術，氣不足，艇幾下沉，連氏又一手　繩，往返遊泳三艇間，逐一打氣，至是三艇始得轉危為安，自下午三時登艇至次日中午遇救止，其間艇上諸人，有焦急萬狀者，有泣不成聲者，迪氏除打槳外，　低首為人禱告，其義勇熱忱，令人感奮，及各人脫險登陸，有贈以金者，拒下受，是又非常人所可及，爰補誌之，以告當世。</p>
<h3>談不用典——聯語新話之三</h3>

<h3>National Army in Shandong Province Rapidly Advances on Multiple Routes, Threatening Qufu in the North and Pointing Towards Sishui in the West, Situation Around Jinan Gradually Improves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 27th Dispatch] The war in central Shandong will take a sharp turn for the better in the coming days. Strong reinforcements of the National Army were airlifted from Qingdao to Jinan on the 27th. The situation outside Jinan has already improved. The National Army forces in Weixian and Jinan are currently encircling and annihilating Yidu from the east and west. The National Army forces in Zou County continued their relentless pursuit of the Communist forces retreating towards Qufu on the 27th, reaching the outskirts of the city in the afternoon, and Qufu is expected to be recovered soon. Military sources stated that the remnants of Chen Yi's Communist forces, who broke through to the northern foot of the Yimeng Mountains, are now trapped in a large National Army encirclement and will be easily annihilated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 27th Dispatch] Fierce fighting continues around Jinan. The National Army is defending Yancheng in the north, Qihe and Changqing in the west, Zhonggong Village in the south, and Guodian on the Jiao-Qi Railway in the east. On the 27th, at dawn, more than 3,000 Communist troops fiercely attacked Yancheng, and the battle was still raging at noon. On the evening of the 26th, 3,000 Communist troops fiercely attacked Guodian, but were repelled by the National Army's counterattack by the morning of the 27th. Longshan was abandoned on the 26th, and over 20,000 troops of Liu Bocheng's Communist forces fled north from Feicheng overnight, attempting to attack Changqing and infiltrate Jinan. The Fifth Division of the Communist forces in eastern Shandong has fled south of Gaomi to regroup and plans to attack Gaomi. The National Army is strictly defending against them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th Dispatch] The National Army, entering southern and western Shandong, is rapidly advancing on multiple routes, developing along the Jinpu Railway on the front line. On the 27th, they broke through the strong resistance of the Communist forces in the central Shandong military region, entered Zou County, and joined forces with the National Army in Ziyang in the afternoon, advancing north and reaching the southern outskirts of Qufu that day. After recovering Fei County, the eastern route of the National Army is actively searching the mountainous areas. A part of the force recovered Qingtuofeng (over 40 kilometers north of Linyi) on the 26th. Another part is pointing west towards Sishui, and will join forces with the National Army south of Qufu beneath the city of Sishui. After defeating Liu Bocheng's forces and recovering Youcheng in western Shandong, the western route of the National Army has recovered all counties south of the Yellow River and west of the Grand Canal. In the future, the main force will develop towards the north bank of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Army's Wu Huawen's column, which has bravely defended Yanzhou for one year and three months, came south to Zou County on the afternoon of the 27th and joined forces with the National Army advancing north.

<h3>Situation in Western Henan Suddenly Tense, National Army in Shanxi Recovers Fujiatang Coal Mine</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 27th Dispatch] Following the great battle in eastern Henan, the situation in western Henan suddenly became critical. According to people coming from Shanxian, the river defense line of over 200 li from Xinan to Zhaoli River in Shanxian has been controlled by the Communist forces. Several ferry crossings, including Kuang Kou, Bailang, Nancun, and Zhaoli River, are also in the hands of the Communist forces. About 7,000 Communist troops are gathered in this area, and heavy Communist forces are also entrenched on the opposite bank of Yuanqu, with unclear intentions. Mianchi is now in a state of terror, and the city gates are blocked. Shanxian and Xinan are also under serious threat, and the situation in western Henan has suddenly become tense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces on the north bank of the Yellow River are colluding north and south with Li Xiannian's forces entrenched in Lushi, occupying four northern townships in Xinan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 27th Dispatch] After recovering Luyi, the National Army continued to expand its gains to the southwest, searching and suppressing the Communist forces in Wutaimiao and Xuanchengji. The remaining Communist forces who fled from Boxian and Jigang County are now scattered in various directions towards Siling and Mengyin, and local militias are preventing them from regrouping. In addition, the Communist forces on the border of Henan appear to be attacking the Dabie Mountains.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces that retreated north from the Tongrunzhen area on the north bank of the Luo River once gathered near Malan, but have now retreated further to the Jushui River basin and the Juyuanguan area, hastily building fortifications.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] On the 24th, the National Army in Shanxi recovered the Fujiatang coal mine south of Lingshi County on the Tongpu Railway. Communist forces in Xiaoyi are dismantling the city walls to transport materials out.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces' Offensive in Changji Frustrated, National Army Deploys for Decisive Battle, Communist Forces South of Pulandian Exert All Efforts to Invade North</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The reason for the slight setback of the Communist forces' offensive on the Changji front is the arrival of National Army reinforcements. There is also a strong National Army force in Dehui.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th Dispatch] Since the Northeastern Communist forces crossed the Songhua River on the 18th to invade south, it has only been ten days, but they have been pressing south step by step and approaching Changchun. However, since the beginning of the fighting, there has been no fierce contact. According to military observers, the National Army is conducting a strategic retreat and deploying for a decisive battle, aiming to deal a fatal blow to the invading Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] A visitor from Changchun said that the Chinese Communist Party's spring offensive in the Northeast was expected long ago, and the National Army Headquarters has made appropriate preparations. The central and northern armies may achieve initial victories, but will ultimately fail. Currently, the Communist forces have two objectives in their offensive in the Northeast: militarily, to support the Communist forces fighting in Shandong; politically, to demonstrate the strength of the Chinese Communist Party and the general importance of the Communist movement before the Moscow Conference.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces are close to Changchun, and gunshots could be heard in the eastern suburbs last night. The Changshi line retreated to Xinglong Mountain (20 li from Changchun) to the southwest, the Changde section retreated to Yijianbao (28 li north of Changchun), and the Changtao Road retreated to the southeast of Xiaohelong. The situation is becoming tense. Traffic to the suburbs has been cut off, and the streets are heavily guarded by military police, indicating that a major battle is about to begin in the suburbs. Military sources also confirmed that the National Army in Jiutai withdrew yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces attacking Jilin are advancing from Huapichang. Liang Huasheng flew back to Jilin a few days ago to take command. While in Shenyang, he said that Yongji could hold out for more than half a month without reinforcements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 26th Dispatch] Li Hong, commander of the New Eighth Army, told reporters at 5:00 PM on the 26th that the Communist forces' claim of launching 200,000 troops to attack Jilin and Changchun is nothing more than an attempt to cover up their repeated defeats. Judging from their forced withdrawal from Huapichang, it is clear that their forces are dispersed and unable to hold their ground. The National Army has made strategic adjustments in line with the actual situation, so sometimes retreating from a certain location is not due to the Communist forces' offensive.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Military news: Huapichang Railway Station on the Jichang Road (70 li from Jilin) was briefly occupied by the Communist forces around 1:00 AM on the 26th. After receiving the news, the military headquarters immediately sent a patrol train to search and suppress the Communist forces. By 2:00 PM, the Communist forces had been repelled. The situation at the front of Tumenling is currently unclear.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The 3,000 men of the First and Second Regiments of the Independent Division of the Communist forces harassing the west side of the Zhongchang Road are now near Dashicao and Nangou, 30 kilometers north of Wafangdian, and appear to be advancing eastward.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th Dispatch] The Communist forces south of Pulandian and Piziwo are exerting all their efforts to invade north in response to the Communist forces' offensive on the Changji front. A certain unit of the Sixth Army Group is intercepting them everywhere.</p>
<h3>Zheng Dongguo Arrives in Nanjing</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo arrived in Beiping from Shenyang at 11:20 AM on the 27th. After resting briefly at Nanyuan Airport, he continued to fly to Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo said that over 100,000 Communist forces have crossed the Songhua River to invade south, with tens of thousands more in the follow-up units. In order to consolidate the major strongholds of Changchun and Jilin, the National Army has planned to withdraw from smaller strongholds. Currently, the Communist forces are closest to Changchun at 20 kilometers. The National Army is continuously sending reinforcements north, and Changchun can be defended without worry. Regarding the situation in southern Liaoning, he said that the takeover of Dalian must be based on orders from the central government. Pulandian has not been lost. Recently, the Communist forces have increased their troops in Dalian by about 40,000. If the takeover is carried out immediately, a battle will be unavoidable. He also said that Lin Biao is still commanding in Harbin, and the rumor of replacing Zhang Xueshi is not accurate.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo arrived in Nanjing around 4:00 PM on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Government Officials and Families in Changchun Retreat to Shenyang, Provisional Consultative Council and Party Headquarters Discuss Rewarding the Troops</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 27th Dispatch] Prices in Changchun are soaring due to the impact of the current situation. The Garrison Command announced a special martial law yesterday, stating that anyone who leaks military secrets, sabotages transportation, spreads rumors to confuse the public, raises market prices, or hoards goods for profit will be subject to the death penalty.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 26th Dispatch] Du Yuming has recently been starting his day at dawn, and inspections are also very busy. The operations department of the Command Headquarters is very tense. Military vehicles traveling north and south on the Shenchang Road are frequent, and passenger and freight trains are still suspended.</p>
<h3>Gendarmerie Headquarters Directly Under the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The Gendarmerie Headquarters will be directly under the Ministry of National Defense from March 1st.</p>
<h3>Agreement Reached with the United States on the Sale of Surplus Materials, Difficulties in Shipping Vessels to China Also Resolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th United Press Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, the difficulties in delaying the shipment of surplus merchant ships to China under the US Surplus Materials and 1946 Ship Sales Act are expected to be resolved soon. Under the Ship Sales Act, China will receive 14,000-ton Liberty ships and 3,000- to 5,000-ton coastal vessels. A large amount of surplus US military materials on Pacific islands has been agreed upon by both parties to be shipped to China before August 30th. The current difficulty is the transportation issue. According to the agreement, all materials will be transported by US ships. China now plans to transport some materials by Chinese ships.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 26th Dispatch] Morrison, Chairman of Morrison Construction Company, said that his company has conducted extensive surveys throughout China for the Chinese government to carry out reconstruction efforts. China's reconstruction expenses will be paid under the future $500 million loan.</p>
<h3>Youth Party Submits List, Formally Delivered to the Government by Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang Says Decision Made to First Participate in Four Institutions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] The list of the Youth Party's representatives to participate in the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, Political Consultative Council, and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has been personally delivered to Chen Lifu and Lei Zhen by Zuo Shunsheng of the party to be forwarded to the government. Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and Liu Dongyan arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai yesterday. At 9:00 AM on the 27th, the three men met with Chairman Chiang, providing opinions on the reorganization of the government and also making contributions on financial and monetary issues. The Youth Party has proposed the following number of representatives to participate in the four institutions: 13 Legislative Yuan members, 6 Control Yuan members, 40 Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association members (including 16 Standing Committee members), and 11 Political Consultative Council members. It is also reported that the Central Standing Committee will hold its 57th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, at which time it will decide on the Kuomintang's candidates to participate in the four institutions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, and others are scheduled to attend the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council on the 28th and will return to Shanghai that evening. Li visited Zhang Qun today to discuss the Sichuan-Xikang issue.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] A reporter inquired with Li Huang about the Youth Party's submission of the list. He said that the party had already discussed the issue of submitting the list to a mature stage while in Shanghai. However, after arriving in Nanjing, they re-negotiated with government officials for several days before making a decision. The reasons for this are: first, the issue of the number of members in the Standing Committee, Propaganda Committee, Research Committee, and Supervisory Committee of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has recently been decided to be 16; second, after the participation of various parties in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the organizational law should be revised to adapt to party politics; third, the two parties hope that the government can issue a statement indicating that the government is moving towards democratic politics. After several days of consultation, an agreement was finally reached. The government has already expressed its agreement to issue a statement. Li also told reporters that his opinions on the reorganization of the government are as follows: first, a comprehensive reorganization, focusing on the reform of local politics; second, the Youth Party has decided internally that it cannot participate alone, so it has only now submitted the list for the four institutions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] When Li Huang, Zuo Shunsheng, Liu Dongyan, and others met with the Chairman, in addition to briefly discussing the reorganization of the government, they also discussed current financial and monetary policies. Li Huang and others also expressed their hope that they could restore order as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Dispatch] Luo Longji and Ye Duyi of the Democratic League arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 27th, carrying a letter signed by Zhang Lan to Chairman Chiang, over a thousand words long, focusing on calling for peace, stopping the civil war, and explaining various economic and political points.

Dawangdian (northwest of Baoding), an important stronghold of the Communist forces, was captured by the National Army yesterday afternoon. About three regiments of Communist forces in that area retreated towards the vicinity of Mancheng. The tug-of-war in Mancheng is approaching a decisive stage.

<h3>Using Reparations and Foreign Materials to Assist in the Restoration of Northeast China's Industry and Mining: Foreign Minister Wang's Remarks in Shenyang En Route to His Ancestral Home</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang, accompanied by his wife and others, departed from Pan [Shenyang] at 8:45 AM on the 27th aboard a special plane. Du Yuming, along with the chairmen and mayors of various provinces, were all present at the airport to see him off. The plane will briefly stop in Ping [Beiping] before continuing to Beijing. Before departing from Shenyang, Wang had a lengthy discussion with Xiong Shihui at his official residence on the afternoon of the 26th.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang has cancelled his trip to Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang arrived in Ping [Beiping] at 11:20 AM on the 27th aboard the "Ziqiang" plane from Shenyang. After having lunch at Nanyuan Airport, he flew back to Beijing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang returned to the capital at 4:15 PM on the 27th via special plane from Shenyang via Ping [Beiping]. Those welcoming him at Ming Palace Airport included Liu Cuo, Gan Naiguang, Wang Huacheng, Zhang Yuanchang, and several dozen others. According to Wang's remarks to our newspaper at the airport, his purpose in going to Ping [Beiping] and Pan [Shenyang] "was merely to take a look and meet with people from the Northeast." When asked by reporters whether the rumors that this trip was to negotiate various issues related to the Northeast with the Soviet side were true, Wang replied, "That is not true." It is noted that Wang departed from Beijing on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Foreign Minister Wang received our newspaper's reporter at his private residence at 5:00 PM on the 27th, and spoke of his impressions of this trip, stating: The extent of damage in Shenyang has reached 70% to 80%. The government intends to use reparations materials and other foreign materials to enable the early restoration of its industry and mining. He believes that if these materials can be used wisely, the entire Northeast can be highly industrialized within five to eight years. During his talk, Wang did not specify the reasons for the damage suffered by Shenyang and other places, nor did he explain how to obtain Japanese reparations materials and other foreign materials.</p>
<p>Wang once traveled to the Northeast 32 years ago. This time, revisiting the old place, he highly praised the human and material resources of the Northeast. He said: "During this trip to the Northeast, I observed the political, economic, and other conditions there. The opening up of the Northeast occurred after 1900. Before that, the Manchus strictly prohibited people from within the Guannei [China Proper] from migrating there. However, after more than ten years of labor by the Chinese people, the number of compatriots from Guannei, especially Hebei and Shandong, migrating there has increased year by year, reaching 1 to 2 million people annually. Some go in the spring and return in the autumn, while others settle there permanently. Since the庚子 [Gengzi] Year [1900], the population has increased from the original 10 million to 45 million. These people are all outstanding individuals from Guannei, who are young, strong, hardworking, and resilient, with excellent qualities and a strong spirit of enterprise. After decades of hard work, they have laid the foundation for the Northeast. Therefore, although the Japanese occupied the Northeast for as long as fourteen years, I did not see the people there become discouraged due to more than ten years of oppression. They are as strong and hardworking as ever, and no less so than before the September 18th Incident [Mukden Incident]. I believed this in the past, and this trip to the north has confirmed the accuracy of this concept. Speaking of the industrial situation in the Northeast, the land there is fertile. The industrial construction of the Japanese in the Northeast has only been around for six or seven years in large part. The scale of Shenyang is very impressive, but it has only been around for six or seven years. The extent of damage currently reaches 70% to 80%. The government plans to use Japanese reparations materials and other foreign materials to assist in the early restoration of industry and mining. According to experts' estimates, if we can make good use of materials, oil field resources, and the strength of the people, we can also make the entire Northeast a highly industrialized area within five to eight years, surpassing the standards of Japan."</p>
<p>Speaking of his feelings in Beiping, Wang said: "In the past, I had a close relationship with Peking University and Tsinghua University. This time, witnessing the tireless teaching spirit of the staff of the two universities under difficult living conditions, which has restored to pre-war state, is admirable and comforting. The facilities of the two universities may be restored to pre-war standards in two years."</p>
<p>Regarding the newspaper reports that he was carrying an important mission on this trip, Wang said: "That is not true." After a long journey, Wang's spirits were good, and he expressed optimism about the country's future. When the reporter took his leave, Wang repeatedly said: "We hope that peace will be restored and unification will be completed as soon as possible." His tone was solemn and forceful, giving people much confidence.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] According to sources, Foreign Minister Wang's trip to the north mainly involves domestic affairs, with little to do with foreign affairs. A Japanese reporter interviewed Wang at the Nanyuan Airport lounge. Wang answered the reporter's questions, saying: (1) "Our country has not requested to participate in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference." When asked about the takeover of Dalian, the China Changchun Railway, and the secret agreements between Sheng Shicai and the Soviet Union, Wang did not respond. He told reporters that he hoped the Chinese people would not be too anxious about the Northeast and foreign affairs, and not make bad assumptions. (2) Wang continued to describe his impressions of inspecting the Northeast, saying: "The foundation of China in the Northeast is built on the working masses. If we use military force to conquer the Northeast, then this military force will eventually collapse. If we use political methods to rule the Northeast, these political methods will also inevitably fail. Only the Northeast based on the working masses is solid and unshakeable." (3) "Regarding the Xisha Islands [Paracel Islands] issue, I believe that a reasonable solution can ultimately be obtained. However, negotiations are still in progress, and I am not in a position to make other remarks." When asked by the reporter whether there were still one or two isolated islands in the Xisha Islands where French troops had not withdrawn, Wang remained silent. (4) "Regarding the Sino-Philippine Commercial Treaty issue, if the Philippine side does not overturn the matters already agreed upon by China and the Philippines and abandons anti-Chinese actions and legislation, then the Sino-Philippine commercial negotiations can be resumed at any time."</p>

They should also provide as much assistance as possible based on the production, manufacturing, and marketing conditions of various industries, using methods such as mortgage loans, overdraft loans, and packaging loans, to cooperate with government policies. However, for the production and marketing businesses of loans, the responsible authorities and the lending banks and bureaus should send personnel to audit the accounts at any time, and strictly comply with the following points:</p>
<p>(A) Production Businesses: (1) The quantity and quality of production must meet the predetermined plan; (2) The selling price of products must not violate the regulations of the responsible authority; (3) Loan funds must be used exclusively for production turnover and must not be transferred for other operations; (4) Products must not be hoarded for speculation.

<h3>Premier Song Explains the Key Points of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, Hosting a Tea Party for Senators Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Premier Song Ziwen held a tea party at the Executive Yuan at 4:30 PM on the 27th to entertain all senators from the Senate Standing Committee. Bei Fengyi, Weng Wenhao, Wang Yunwu, and Yu Hongjun attended and answered questions. The event adjourned at 6:00 PM. All reports and inquiries focused on the economic emergency measures plan, without involving other matters, so the tea party went well. A total of twelve senators attended, including Wu Yifang, Wang Puhan, Fan Yu, Mo Dehui, Li Huang, and Chen Qitian. Fu Sinian, Luo Heng, and Yin Shuxian did not attend. First, Premier Song reported on the formulation and implementation of the economic emergency measures plan and explained two key points of the plan: (1) The immediate goal is to crack down on speculation; (2) The fundamental goal is to balance revenue and expenditure. The measures include tightening expenditures and making public utilities self-sufficient or privatizing them to reduce the burden on the national treasury. Then, various senators raised inquiries, which are briefly noted as follows:</p>
<p>Inquiries and Responses</p>
<p>Xue Mingjian asked: (1) Public utilities are the first to raise prices, affecting commodity prices; (2) The issuance of large amounts of fiat currency causes public panic and misunderstanding, and it is best to avoid inflation. Wang Puhan asked: (1) What are the measures in the plan to stabilize the currency system? (2) Conscription in various places has caused harassment to the people. How will this be handled? Song replied: The conscription issue can be addressed by the Ministry of National Defense. Su Ting asked: Prices increase with the US dollar exchange rate, while wages are based on a monthly index. What are the measures to flatten prices? Song replied: Daily necessities can be controlled, so efforts are being made to supply goods at fixed prices. Wang Yunwu added in reply: Workers' wages have been based on the cost of living index since before the war, so wages are very high. Wages are now uniformly issued according to the cost of living index in January, but daily necessities are rationed and priced through negotiation, which is handled by various factories. Wu Yifang asked: Can private schools be rationed with in-kind goods? Wang replied: No. Gan Jiaxin asked: When implementing the plan, attention should be paid to: (1) Balancing revenue and expenditure; (2) Whether production loans are being recovered; (3) Gold smuggling to Hong Kong; (4) In-kind rationing should be flexible; (5) Effective measures should be adopted to use the deposits of Chinese citizens abroad; (6) The Shanghai Economic Supervisory Group only handles small matters and not big ones; (7) The plan should be implemented carefully step by step, otherwise the government's credit will be bankrupt. Song replied: (1) Production loans that have not yet matured have not been recovered; (2) The price of gold in Hong Kong has fallen, and there is currently no smuggling to Hong Kong; (3) The Ministry of Finance has drafted measures for using deposits abroad, which will be announced soon. Xi Zhenduo asked: (1) Attention should be paid to gold price fluctuations; (2) The adjustment of the US dollar exchange rate and the price increases of public utilities affect commodity prices. How can this be suppressed? A response is needed; (3) The handling of enemy and puppet properties should be clarified; (4) Attention should be paid to the lives of people in the border areas to ensure their stability. Song immediately instructed Jiang Menglin to respond on behalf of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. Mo Dehui said: The current measures are measures of desperation. He hopes that they will not be empty words and hopes that Song can meet with senators from time to time. Approaching the government with public opinion can resolve many difficulties. Song expressed, "Very good."</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] During Premier Song's tea party, a senator asked whether Song's frequent presence in Shanghai would prevent him from addressing the country's overall issues. Song replied that Shanghai is an important area for our country, and 50% of the country's income is in Shanghai. As Minister of Finance, I would go to Shanghai two or three times a week.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Senate Standing Committee will hold a regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, with Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, reporting.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Rationing Issues in the Current Stage</h3>
<p>How rationing is implemented is attracting attention, especially from the working class, who hope to obtain some compensation from it after the freezing of the cost-of-living index, and are paying even closer attention to this matter. There are many issues worthy of discussion. We hereby raise further opinions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Issue of Converting Goods into Cash: Since the cost-of-living index has been frozen at the January level, in order to compensate for this, goods should be rationed starting from this month. According to government announcements, all rice, flour, fuel, cloth, etc., have been separately undertaken by the responsible departments. However, where are the goods stored? What is the total quantity stored? How can they be transported to the rationing locations in a short period of time? Which organizations will implement the rationing? How many units and people are entitled to receive rations? What procedures will be used for distribution? What forms and documents should the recipients prepare? Where should the payments be made? What are the rationing prices, and the time periods, locations, etc.? All these details still need to be planned and designated. However, this month is already ending today. These preparations not only need to be organized separately by the government but also by the factories. Therefore, the suggestion from the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to convert the difference between the prices of February and January into cash is very timely and should be promptly reviewed and implemented. Moreover, if there are no other problems with the source of these daily necessities, then the rationing of goods in subsequent months may also be handled in this way. This is because: (1) The government can avoid countless labor and expenses; (2) Factories can also save a lot of trouble and costs; (3) The working class will not actually suffer any losses; (4) The procedures are simple; (5) The time is easy to determine.</p>
<p>(2) The Issue of the Types and Quantities of Goods: The government stipulates that each worker receives 4 dou of rice, 100 catties of coal briquettes, and 2 zhang of cloth every six months. Some people believe that the types and quantities are too small, and the difference compared to civil servants and teachers is too large, so they have expressed their dissent. Some advocate (1) that both the types and quantities should be increased to be equal to those of civil servants and teachers, or (2) that the items included in the cost-of-living index should all be included, or even directly propose (3) restoring the cost-of-living index. In fact, if the second method is implemented, it would be no different from restoring the cost-of-living index, merely adding a set of procedures in the calculation, which would be somewhat comical. Therefore, if the third method cannot be implemented, then the only feasible method is the first one, that is, to increase the types and quantities of rations for workers separately, in accordance with the standards for civil servants and teachers. The reason is that the implementation of rationing is originally intended to supply daily necessities at affordable prices to reduce their burden, so the identity, occupation, etc., of the recipients do not need to be distinguished. In countries with comprehensive rationing, there is originally no difference between workers and civil servants and teachers, except for a very small number of special treatments. In fact, the consumption of rice, flour, cloth, etc., by workers may even be higher than that of intellectuals. Therefore, we also believe that this request is very reasonable and very easy to implement. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau has approved a flexible approach, expanding the types to six: rice, coal, oil, salt, sugar, and cloth, which is equal to what civil servants and teachers receive. The quantities are set at 8 dou of rice, 1.5 dan of coal, 5 catties of oil, 5 catties of salt, 1 catty of sugar, and 5 chi of cloth. Except for sugar and cloth, which remain the same, the sugar item is already equal to that of civil servants and teachers, coal is increased by 50%, and the quantities of oil and salt are even higher than those of civil servants and teachers, based on the household survey from the cost-of-living index, which is certainly a very reasonable measure.</p>
<p>(3) The Issue of Rationing Agencies: To date, the central and local rationing agencies have still not been determined. What is known is that (1) the central government will supply goods through the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Food, and the Resources Committee; (2) the local government will be responsible for managing the matter through local administrative agencies, and existing goods management agencies, special stores, or cooperatives will handle the actual work. We have always opposed overlapping agencies. Therefore, if the matter of rationing can be handled conveniently without increasing agencies and personnel, we will naturally strongly support it in principle. However, once the matter of rationing is undertaken, it will involve many complexities, and everything must consider the supply and convenience of the public. The procedures for the time, location, type, quantity, etc., must be simple and uniform, in order to establish credibility. It is essential to avoid shifting responsibility and creating confusion, which would increase the burden on recipients and lose public trust. Therefore, we believe that firstly, there must be a responsible agency to take overall charge of the matter, and secondly, one should not be too stingy with the necessary office personnel and expenses.</p>
<p>(4) The Issue of Rationing Targets: The Economic Emergency Measures Program and the Detailed Rules for the Supply of Daily Necessities supplemented to this program seem to limit the rationing targets to civil servants and teachers and industrial workers. Occupational workers, store employees, and private school teachers and staff are not included. In fact, since they are all teachers and staff, why differentiate between public and private? As for occupational workers and store employees, there are many who are currently paid according to the cost-of-living index. Since the index has been frozen, rationing goods should also be issued in accordance with the example, to ensure uniformity. The Social Affairs Bureau has supplemented this scope of application, stipulating that anyone who is paid according to the cost-of-living index, regardless of the type of worker, including store employees, should be allowed to handle the matter together. This method can save countless hassles and is very appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four points, there is also the issue of civil servants' salaries. After the implementation of rationing of daily necessities, there are rumors that the method of adjusting salaries every three months will be shelved. If the rumors are true, it is also worth considering. This is because civil servants' salaries have never been calculated according to the cost-of-living index, and the fact that their salaries are low is a well-known fact. Regardless of the benefits they will enjoy after the implementation of rationing starting from March 15th, the current salaries they receive are far below the calculations based on the index. Therefore, freezing salaries and not adjusting them is ultimately unreasonable. Some say that there was no such statement in the emergency plan and the discussions of the authorities, and that it is just a rumor. We also deeply believe that it is just a rumor.</p>
<h3>Valuing People's Spiritual Food</h3>
<p>Modern newspapers are often called "spiritual food." People cannot go a day without reading the newspaper, which is equivalent to people cannot go a day without eating. The function of modern newspapers for society is really very significant. Thus, Western countries all use the development of each country's newspaper industry as a measure to assess the level of its culture. Our country's newspaper industry has been known to be backward. But after eight years of arduous struggle during the Anti-Japanese War, it has indeed made significant progress after the victory. Taking Shanghai as an example, today's newspaper industry in Shanghai, when compared with before the Anti-Japanese War, has made obvious progress whether in content, form, or sales. But in recent months, the national newspaper industry, because of the sharp rise in foreign exchange rates and the reduction in the source of newsprint, has had to reduce the number of pages and increase the price, so that our country's newspaper industry is facing another serious crisis.</p>
<p>The Import Temporary Management Committee announced on the 18th of this month the import quota for February to April this year. Among them, regarding the portion of spiritual food, the government approved only 3.45 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange for paper imports, and cigarette paper, pulp, and other paper must also be included. The remaining foreign exchange that can be used to purchase newsprint rolls and flat paper is only 2 million U.S. dollars. If all the foreign exchange is used to purchase Canadian paper, only 12,500 tons can be purchased for the use of the national newspaper industry. We feel that the government's quota for paper imports is not only too restrictive but also obviously unfair. Although those affected by this approach are only the Chinese newspaper industry, the bad consequences will inevitably affect the cultural undertaking of the Chinese nation. Therefore, standing in the position of the newspaper industry, and also for the sake of the future of the cultural undertaking, we have to appeal loudly to the government, requesting the responsible authorities to immediately relax the limits on paper imports!</p>
<p>We not only fully understand the current economic difficulties, but also recognize that the government's adoption of import restrictions is indeed necessary. During this difficult period, any sector or industry must tighten its belt. The newspaper industry is naturally no exception and should also reduce the number of pages and reduce the circulation to avoid wasting paper. However, the distance between the government's quota and the actual needs is really too far. Taking the newspaper industry in Shanghai as an example, the monthly consumption of paper is about 4,000 tons. During this period from February to April, the amount of paper required by the Shanghai newspaper industry suddenly reduced by half, how can our colleagues cope with this situation? The government is now implementing an economic emergency plan. How can this approach reduce the price of newsprint? Moreover, newsprint is the spiritual food of the people, which cannot be interrupted for a day, otherwise, the people will panic spiritually, and the severity is no less than a food panic. I remember during this war, in the most dangerous year for Britain, when it was surrounded by German submarines, even food became a problem. But in this year, the amount of paper imported into Britain still reached 500,000 tons, which is enough to show the importance that the British authorities attached to spiritual food. Britain could do this during wartime, how can our country ignore the spiritual food of the people in peacetime! The concept of our people has always been that "spirit is more important than matter." How can the government authorities sit idly by and watch the people's spiritual food panic?</p>
<p>The announcement of the import quota for the first quarter of this year may be due to the urgency of the time. The actual needs of various goods could not be taken into account, which makes us unable to express our regret. The handling of paper is unfair, as mentioned above. In addition, there is one more thing, because it is also related to culture, that we cannot but point out. That is, the Import Temporary Management Committee did not impose any restrictions on the import of foreign-made films, but restricted the film negatives used to make films. The impact of this on the domestic film industry is no less than a major blow, and it encourages the import of foreign films instead. The unreasonableness of this approach is self-evident.</p>
<p>In short, we have to petition the government regarding the import quotas stipulated by the government, especially several items related to cultural undertakings, requesting the government to think about the future of the cultural undertaking, pay more attention to the people's spiritual food, and promptly relax the limits on paper imports!</p>

<h3>The United States Proposes a Trusteeship Agreement Draft; The Soviet Union Suggests Three Revisions; The Security Council Postpones the Debate Until the Seventh of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: At the Security Council meeting today, the Soviet representative Gromyko immediately accepted the terms proposed by the United States for the trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Central Pacific.</p>
<p>[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 26th] The Security Council met today to discuss the issue of the former Japanese mandated islands. First, the US representative Austin stated the US position, followed by the Soviet representative Gromyko. Gromyko reiterated the previous position, saying that it was fair to hand over these islands to the United States for management, and proposed three requests for revision: (1) The phrase "become an integral part of the United States" in the draft should be deleted; (2) The phrase "promote the self-government of the residents" in the draft should be changed to "promote the self-government or independence of the residents"; (3) The Security Council has the right to change or terminate the trusteeship agreement.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, New York, Lake Success, 26th] The US representative Austin submitted a proposal to the Security Council today, advocating that the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific should be immediately handed over to the United States for trusteeship, and that "military strategic areas" should be established in the Marshall Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands. However, the final fate of these islands should be decided by the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet representative Gromyko expressed his support for this. The Security Council immediately decided to postpone the Australian proposal for discussion until March 7, so that the representatives could have sufficient time to consult with their respective governments.</p>
<p>The US representative Austin stated in his speech when submitting the above proposal that the US proposal is sufficient to show that the American people are determined to prevent these islands from becoming a springboard for launching aggression against the United States or other member states of the United Nations. The US aim is to ensure its own security and international collective security. The United States still adheres to the Atlantic Charter and will not engage in territorial expansion after the war. The United States will manage the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific in accordance with the provisions of the Atlantic Charter. In the future, we will establish an international control system to control the military and weapons, and to control the economic, political, cultural, and social development of the people of the islands. The current US trusteeship method will not hinder the implementation of all measures stipulated by the international control system. The final fate of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific must be decided by the peace treaty with Japan. The US proposal to quickly hand over the islands it has already occupied to the United States for trusteeship is strategically important. Japan violated its obligations and turned these islands into heavily fortified fortresses, thereby isolating the United States from Guam, the Philippine Islands, and the territories of the British and Dutch in the Far East. The most important military strategic locations in the world are now under the absolute control of the great powers, but the United States only proposes to grant trusteeship and does not intend to annex these islands. The US trusteeship draft also takes into account the trusteeship agreement passed by the last General Assembly of the United Nations. According to the trusteeship charter, bases should be built on these islands. The United States has submitted a trusteeship plan to the relevant countries, which can be said to have fulfilled its obligations. Considering that other member states of the United Nations do not seek to manage these islands, the US action seems more reasonable. The United States believes that the trusteeship agreement can be implemented immediately without waiting for the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. The Soviet representative Gromyko took the floor and expressed that his government supported the US plan, and said that it was completely reasonable for us to authorize the United States to manage these islands because the United States suffered far greater losses on these islands during the war than other Allied countries.</p>

<p>Scope of Goods Rationing Expanded, Those Paid According to Index Eligible to Apply for Supply, Six Types Added, Quantities Increased Separately, Social Bureau Announces Average Prices Today</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Today is the last day of February. How should the salaries and wages of employees of various factories be calculated for this month? Yesterday, Director Wu of the Social Bureau stated: "In addition to being paid according to the January cost of living index, a 'differential subsidy system' will be implemented. That is, the difference between the average market price of several essential daily necessities determined by the government for rationing in February and the average market price in January will be converted into legal tender and issued by the factory. The quantity and types of daily necessities for this rationing originally only stipulated 5 'shi dou' of rice per person per month, 100 'shi jin' of coal briquettes per person per month, and 2 'zhang' of cloth per person every six months, and were limited to factory employees only. This time, Mayor Wu and I went to the capital to strongly advocate to the authorities, and with the approval of Chairman Chiang, the types and quantities of daily necessities supplied have been increased to:</p>
<p>(1) Rice or flour - 8 'shi dou' of rice per person per month, or 2 bags of flour.</p>
<p>(2) Cloth - 5 'chi' per person per month, i.e., 3 'zhang' every six months.</p>
<p>(3) Fuel - 150 'shi jin' of coal briquettes per person per month.</p>
<p>(4) Salt - 3 'shi jin' per person per month.</p>
<p>(5) Sugar - 1 'shi jin' per person per month.</p>
<p>(6) Cooking oil - 5 'shi jin' per person per month.</p>
<p>The scope of supply has also been expanded to include all those whose salaries and wages are calculated based on the cost of living index. This method will be implemented on a trial basis, limited to this city for the time being. The Social Bureau is scheduled to announce today the average price for January, the average price for February, the difference, and the converted amount for the above six major essential commodities. This month's salaries and wages will be calculated accordingly." Director Wu finally stated that this method is currently a trial, for a minimum of three months and a maximum of five months.</p>
<p>Chairman Authorizes Handling as Appropriate</p>
<p>Since the government announced the Emergency Economic Measures, freezing the January cost of living index and providing fewer types and quantities of daily necessities to employees than to civil servants and teachers, workers in various places have expressed opposition upon hearing the news. Chairman Chiang summoned Mayor Wu and Director Wu to the capital on the afternoon of the 25th to discuss this matter. The two immediately took the night train to Beijing at 11 p.m. with their proposed suggestions. On the morning of the 26th, they paid a visit to President Song, and at noon, the Chairman hosted a banquet, during which the two presented their proposed suggestions, namely that the types of daily necessities supplied to workers in this city should be equal to those of civil servants and teachers, and that the quantity should be based on the quantity used when compiling the cost of living index. The Chairman believed that if Shanghai had no choice but to do so, it could be handled accordingly. The two completed their mission in the capital and took the express train back to Shanghai at 3:45 p.m. on the afternoon of the 26th, arriving at around 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Those Who Do Not Wish to Receive Rations in Kind May Implement Differential Cash Payments</p>
<p>Director Wu told reporters yesterday: I can give up my official position, but the policy must be implemented. Now that the proposed method has been adopted by the government, I will do my best to solve the living problems of the city's workers first, and then do my best to suppress prices. There are a total of 216,750 industrial workers in this city. This time, through a flexible method, it is stipulated that all those whose salaries and wages are calculated according to the cost of living index (that is, no longer limited to civil servants, teachers, and industrial workers) can be included in this method, which can include 500,000 people. Whether to implement the differential subsidy system or supply goods in kind in the future depends entirely on the opinion of the factory. Because many factory owners believe that the quality of the goods supplied and the procedures for receiving and distributing goods are too troublesome, if labor and management agree to implement the differential subsidy system, the factory will issue the difference to the employees in converted legal tender. Otherwise, it is also possible to apply to the Social Bureau to purchase goods in kind for supply. The Social Bureau will announce the average price of the six major essential commodities at the end of each month, as well as the difference from the previous month. The calculation is based on the average price from the 1st to the 25th. The compilation is based on retail prices, not wholesale prices. The Social Bureau will definitely strive for reasonableness, ensuring that the subsidy can buy the goods in kind on the market.</p>
<p>Regarding the workers' hope to restore the calculation of wages based on the cost of living index, Director Wu expressed: It is feared that this is impossible.</p>
<p>Rationing Expected by Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu told reporters yesterday after returning from Nanjing the night before: The cost of living index issue is a matter within the purview of the Social Bureau, and the detailed content will be fully published by the Social Bureau today. As for the Civil Servants and Teachers Daily Necessities Allocation Committee, it is organized by 15 institutions including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Department, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Materials Supply Bureau, Taiwan Sugar Company, China Textile Company, Salt Affairs Bureau, China Grain Company, China Vegetable Oil Factory, and Fuel Management Committee. Mayor Wu serves as the chairman, but it must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before it can be established. The central government's order has not yet arrived, but it is believed that it will arrive within days. After the allocation committee is formally established, it will actively carry out the allocation matters, striving to start distributing rations separately from March 15th. Regarding the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index, it is said that the central government is considering it, but the outcome is still impossible to predict at this time.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Representatives Return to Shanghai, Petition Has Yielded Results [Report from Our Newspaper] Shui Xiangyun, Wang Zhenbai, and other nine members of the Standing Committee of the National Postal Workers' Union, who went to Beijing to petition regarding the freezing of the cost of living index for postal workers, returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Shui, he and representatives of postal workers from Beijing, Hankou, Henan, Anhui, and other places stated their opinions to Acting Director Huo of the Directorate General of Posts. Mr. Huo stated that he was restricted by laws and regulations and could not grant their request, but he was sympathetic to the difficult living conditions of postal workers and approved the issuance of differential cash payments according to the method of rationing goods in kind for civil servants and teachers. The representatives accepted this.</p>
<p>Surplus Materials Sold in Large Quantities</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan has recently ordered the rapid sale of surplus materials in order to implement the emergency measures to ration and suppress prices.

<p>No Explicit Instructions from the Central Government Regarding Differential Cash Payments for Civil Servants and Teachers</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] A reporter asked Director Wu of the Social Bureau yesterday: The method of supplying goods in kind will be implemented from March. Civil servants and teachers have not yet been issued this month. Will the central government also implement a "differential subsidy system" to subsidize civil servants and teachers with cash? Director Wu replied: After the method of supplying daily necessities to civil servants and teachers was announced, a committee has been organized by 15 agencies in this city to handle it. However, no orders have arrived from the Executive Yuan so far, and this matter should await instructions from the central government.</p>

<p>Yellow Goods Fly Everywhere, Efforts to Investigate Intensively, Future Work of the Economic Supervisory Team Will Be Conducted in Secret</p>
<p>The Economic Supervisory Team is scheduled to end its external facade tomorrow, and the actual work will continue and expand in a purely secret manner. This is in accordance with the Chairman's instructions to make meticulous arrangements for the "economic detection network" in order to eliminate and prevent possible man-made pathologies in the economic field in the future, and to ensure the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures.</p>
<p>Among the three groups of the Economic Supervisory Team, the Gold and Currency Group is the most difficult. The general report of the group is being personally drafted by Xu Youzuo, the head of the group. All parties attach great importance to this report. As for the unfinished work of the group, it will continue to intensify in the future. It is currently working hard to investigate the use of aircraft to transport gold to other places for profit in Lizhou. It is said that some speculators used special methods to transport gold by plane to Beijing, Chongqing, Xi'an, Kunming, Lanzhou, Qingdao, and other places, in considerable quantities.</p>
<p>As for the rumour that soldiers used military funds to purchase gold, it is reported that no evidence has been found so far.</p>

<p>Embezzlement of Public Funds for Gold Purchases, Related to Huangzhong Company</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the embezzlement of public funds by Zhao Pei, director of the Qinghai Provincial Government's Office in Beijing, it is reported that the Qinghai-Gansu and Qinghai-Tibet Highway Bureaus applied to the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transport for 1 billion yuan in engineering funds in December of last year to improve the two highways. Zhao Pei was responsible for receiving the funds. When the National Treasury Bureau notified the payment, Zhao entrusted the Shanghai Office of Huangzhong Company to receive the funds on his behalf. Huangzhong Company is nominally a private business organization engaged in the cotton cloth business. It was established in Xining in November of the 44th year. The Shanghai Office was opened in September of the 35th year, located at No. 7 Tongan Lane, Hankou Road. The manager is Wu Ziming. This time, the supervisors and the Economic Supervisory Team found that Huangzhong Company purchased a large number of gold bars from Tongfengyu Gold Shop. Wu Ziming was summoned and reportedly admitted that he had been entrusted by a friend in Qinghai to buy gold, and that the gold had been taken to other places by this friend. The supervisors believe that Zhao Pei entrusted Huangzhong Company to receive public funds, and Huangzhong Company happened to buy a large amount of gold with huge sums of money. The subtle clues are clearly visible. Therefore, various evidence has been collected and an impeachment will be filed soon.</p>
<p>Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory Purchases Gold, Investigation Shows It Was Not Speculative</p>
<p>The Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory, which was involved in the gold rush, is run by professors from various universities. It is reported that: (1) the fact that the factory purchased gold was publicly recorded in the books; (2) the date of purchase was the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve, and the gold rush occurred two weeks later; (3) the purpose of the purchase was indeed to repay debts, and the four creditors have names and addresses; (4) the auditors of the Four Banks also believe that it was not speculative, but to repay debts. Based on the above circumstances, it is unlikely to constitute a crime of disrupting finance.</p>
<p>China Industrial Bank Declares It Did Not Buy U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the Economic Supervisory Team's investigation into the China Industrial Bank's trading of U.S. dollars, the bank declared yesterday that it was inconsistent with the facts. It is said that the bank sold a factory last year and signed a contract. The contract price was based on U.S. dollar cash. If the transaction could not be completed, the refund would still be based on U.S. dollars. Because the factory to be sold still had to be returned by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau and other procedures, the proceeds received could not be processed immediately and were stored in the warehouse without being moved, but they were recorded in detail in the books without concealment. When the auditors came to the bank to audit the accounts, they were told the truth and the relevant documents were checked. The auditors verified that it was consistent and indicated that it was not related to the Emergency Economic Measures.</p>
<p>Silver Shops Hopeful to Resume Business</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau, told reporters yesterday: Because the government restricts the buying and selling of gold ornaments, silver shops in this city have closed down one after another. If not properly resolved, the lives of the workers and their families in the silver shop industry, totaling 70,000 to 80,000 people, will be quite problematic. During this trip to Beijing, I suggested a compromise to the central government, hoping to allow workers to have jobs and prevent gold from flowing into the black market. The central government stated that it could continue to operate as long as it did not violate these two principles.</p>
<p>Principles for Supplementary Payment of Deed Tax Determined for Land Transfers in Huangpu and Other Districts</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Deed tax should be levied on land transfers according to law. Land transfers in this city have been very complicated from the period of the occupation to the present. When the Land Administration Bureau started land registration after the victory, it temporarily postponed the collection in order to reduce procedures. Now that the land registration procedures in Huangpu and other six districts have been completed, the arrangement of the deed tax cannot be delayed any longer, so it has been decided to pay the deed tax retroactively. The principles are: The transfer of land owned by foreigners will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the treaty if they are treaty nationals. For land deeds owned by Chinese citizens, if the transfer of property rights occurred on December 8 of the 31st year, deed tax should be supplemented. The tax rate is 6% for sales deed tax, 4% for pawn deed tax, and 2% for exchange deed tax. For land in registered areas after the victory, the transfer must also be supplemented before applying for registration. The starting standard for supplementary deed tax is based on 500 yuan per lot, and those less than 500 yuan are exempt. If several lots are calculated together and the tax amount is more than 500 yuan, it should still be paid according to the regulations.</p>

<p>Wusong Shipyard徵民徵民地,市府請可請市府會</p>
<p>The Central Shipyard plans to build a new Wusong shipyard. It has been approved to requisition private land and houses. The Land Administration Bureau has been ordered to start surveying and appraising and notifying the deadline for relocation. The parties concerned believe that the appraisal is not fair and the relocation deadline is too urgent. Representatives were elected to appeal to the Municipal Council for relief. After the council submitted an inquiry to the municipal government, a reply has now been received. According to the reply, the Land Administration Bureau has carefully handled the land appraisal in accordance with the prescribed procedures and there are no unfair circumstances in the review. If the owners believe that the appraisal is unfair, they can file an objection with the bureau in accordance with the law. According to the provisions of the Land Law, it shall be submitted to the Municipal Standard Land Price Assessment Committee for assessment. However, the Central Shipyard is deeply sympathetic to the situation of the people whose land and houses have been requisitioned. Once the new shipyard of the factory starts construction, they can use the available energy at that time to find ways to employ them as soon as possible to provide relief.</p>

<p>Paris New Village Robbery, Thieves Wear Civilian Police Uniforms, Victim Calls for Help and Arrests Them, Recognizing Friend's Son-in-Law</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The apartment at No. 49 Chongqing South Road, Lane 169, namely Paris New Village, is where Jin Wenchao, who does business with a certain bank, lives. At around 7 a.m. yesterday morning, a bandit suddenly invaded the bedroom on the second floor under the pretext of inquiring about Ni Peiqing (Ni is Jin's nephew-in-law), threatened with a gun, and handcuffed the victim Jin Wenchao with his hands behind his back. He caught sight of his wife Yu's wearing a diamond ring and a red gem ring, and forced her to take them off, and asked where other ornaments were hidden? Ms. Yu replied that there were none, which angered the bandit. The bandit took out another pair of handcuffs, handcuffed her, and hit her on the head with the butt of the gun, causing her to bleed profusely. Jin Wenchao pleaded with the bandit, saying that if he wanted ornaments, he could allow her to borrow gold bars from Maochang Silver Shop at No. 505 Sichuan Road and pay him. The bandit ignored him and held on for an hour. Jin suddenly had an idea and pretended to run to the window and shout for robbers, fearing that the street police would arrive. Jin Wenchao followed and chased out, calling for help along the way. Seeing that the incident was exposed, the bandit quickly hired a rickshaw and headed east on Fuxing Middle Road. Coincidentally, there were patrol police officers at posts No. 4478 and 4967 at the entrance of Fuxing Park. Upon hearing the alarm, they bravely pursued and arrested the suspect at the entrance of No. 55 on the same road, seized a pistol with six bullets inside, and found the original stolen goods. The bandit was wearing a civilian police uniform and was taken to the Lujiwan Sub-bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, his name is Ni Pengqing, 29 years old, a local. According to the victim Jin Wenchao, he had just returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the night before, and the bandit had been brought to his residence once by his nephew-in-law Ni Peiqing last June. Afterwards, Section Chief Hao led Inspector Ni's family, Police Chief Ma Bingzhang, to the scene of the incident to investigate. One side of the injured woman was accompanied by the police officer in charge to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Due to the blood concentration on the police armband, there were rumours of a policeman being shot.</p>
<p>Sulphur Explodes on the Wharf, Affecting the Gold House</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] At 11:10 a.m. yesterday, a batch of sulfur, a total of 100 barrels of cargo, was being loaded onto the No. 1 Wharf Warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau at No. 880 Dongdaming Road (i.e., Broadway Road). The warehouse manager designated it to be stacked in a mobile gold house shipped from the United States in order to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, the porters did not understand the principles of chemistry. During unloading, they allowed the flammable material to come into contact with the air, causing a fire and explosion shortly after entering the warehouse. For a time, the flames soared into the sky and were beyond control. In addition to all the sulfur and a mobile gold house being burned down, the adjacent Warehouse No. 17 was also affected. Fortunately, the Fire Department was informed and immediately sent a large number of vehicles to the scene to isolate and extinguish the fire, so no major disaster was caused. The fire was extinguished at 1 p.m. It is also reported that a leather shoe workshop at No. 22, Lane 155, Chengdu Road, caught fire at 8:50 a.m. yesterday due to carelessness.

<h3>Completion of Japanese Inspection Tour, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Arrives in Honolulu</h3>
<p>[United Press, Honolulu, 27th] U.S. Secretary of the Interior Krug, after touring Japan and the Pacific, briefly stopped in Shanghai and is now en route to Washington via Honolulu. In a statement released today, he said that as soon as he arrives in Washington, he will immediately urge the transfer of Guam and other Pacific islands from military to civilian rule. Krug stated, "The Navy's performance is highly commendable," but "we feel that military rule is incompatible with the fundamental principles of American self-governance." He continued, "In Guam, I found that there were few remedies or avenues of appeal against naval administrative decisions, creating a sense of mistreatment among American civilian personnel and the indigenous population." He pointed out that this change will be gradual, as it involves Congress drafting legislation authorizing the government to administer the island and selecting a civilian administrative body. However, Krug also urged the Navy to continue providing practical assistance in maintaining transportation, health, and communication services, noting that the Army is also cooperating in the same mission in Alaska. Secretary Krug also stated that he was not surprised that the Soviet Union agreed to the U.S. trusteeship of former Japanese mandated territories, because while in Japan, MacArthur told him that "if we are firm and confident in our position in any region, the Soviet Union will accommodate us."</p>

<h3>U.S. Should Establish Department of Defense; Truman Formally Submits Proposal to Congress</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] President Truman today submitted a plan to Congress to merge the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, requesting the establishment of a Department of Defense headed by a civilian secretary who would be a member of the Cabinet. The Army, Navy, and Air Force would be separately administered, but their respective secretaries would not be members of the Cabinet. The President's plan, entitled "National Security Act of 1947," includes several thorough revisions of the original plan, such as: (1) establishing a Department of the Air Force, headed by a civilian secretary appointed by the President; (2) authorizing the Secretary of Defense to transfer Army aviation units to the Department of the Air Force when deemed necessary or appropriate; (3) renaming the "Secretary of War" and "Department of War" as "Secretary of the Army" and "Department of the Army"; (4) establishing a Military Council to advise the Secretary of Defense on military policy issues; (5) establishing a Joint Chiefs of Staff as the President's principal military advisory body; and (6) establishing a Munitions Board, headed by a civilian chairman, to plan for industrial mobilization.</p>

If the proposal is passed, stationing or sending military missions to China would not require special legislation.</p>
<h3>Stalemate in Palestine Difficult to Break; Britain Considers Submitting to the UN General Assembly; White House Issues Statement Clarifying U.S. Position</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 26th] Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative to the United Nations, held talks with UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie today to discuss the possibility of convening a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue. Afterward, reliable sources said that Secretary-General Lie replied that convening a special session of the UN General Assembly would be difficult, with the issue of expenses being the most difficult to resolve, as convening the UN General Assembly would cost approximately one million U.S. dollars. However, if the British government formally submits this request, he is still prepared to consider it. Unofficial sources said that Secretary-General Lie and Sir Alexander Cadogan also discussed whether to submit the Palestine issue to the Security Council or the Trusteeship Council.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 26th, United Press] Senior British government officials recently announced that Britain is studying the possibility of submitting the Palestine issue to a special session of the General Assembly before the UN General Assembly convenes in September.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The White House issued a statement today, stating that the accusations made during the British House of Commons debate on the Palestine issue, which alleged that the United States' interests in Palestine and Jewish immigration were motivated by domestic partisan strife, were extremely disrespectful and likely to cause misunderstanding. The statement also said that the United States has a long-term interest in Palestine, and the American people, regardless of political affiliation, express deep concern. President Truman's statement on October 4, 1946, was intended only to reiterate his previous stance on Palestine and Jewish immigration, which he had expressed in the summer of 1945. This stance is based on the President's deep desire to propose a reasonable solution to the Palestine issue.</p>
<p>British Government Officials Explain Bevin's Motives</p>

It is reported that Bevin hopes the United States will understand that "if negotiations of a similar nature occur in the future, they should be considered from an international standpoint, and the United States should avoid issuing unilateral statements, as such statements have no beneficial impact on the negotiations."</p>
<h3>Demonstrations by Belgian Soldiers Captured During the War Demand Pensions; Parliament Surrounded All Day, Situation Tense</h3>

The demonstrators carried banners with slogans such as "Enlisted in 1940 - Deceived in 1947" and "Down with Freha." Some also carried photographs of the exiled King Leopold and two captured soldiers, with the inscription: "All Forgotten."</p>

<h3>The World's Attention on the Arctic</h3>
<p>— This Newspaper's Research Department</p>
<p>...It is hoped that this place will become a major thoroughfare for the exchange of cultures and goods, and that the tragedies that have been played out in the Pacific will not be re-enacted here, defiling this pristine place with the evils of human civilization.</p>
<p>The Arctic has become the focus of attention for various countries competing with each other. This vast snowy sea will soon become a hunting ground for the aviation industry and the center of international competition. Humanity has been striving to conquer the two poles for over a thousand years. Initially, it was to explore scientific secrets, then to attempt to obtain some treasures, and now the purpose has shifted to national defense.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Arctic Exploration History</p>
<p>As early as the ninth century, Norwegian navigators had visited the Arctic region, pioneering Arctic exploration. After the discovery of the American continent, many navigators and explorers believed that crossing the Arctic was a shortcut from the West to Asia. In 1553, the English explorer Willoughby set out from London, intending to be the first to traverse this shortcut, but unfortunately, he was blocked north of the White Sea, and all the crew members perished. In 1879, the Swedish explorer Nordenskiöld set out from Gothenburg, Sweden, and reached the Bering Strait, taking a year to complete this route for the first time. Afterward, others continued to venture there. In 1932, the Soviet icebreaker "Sibiryakov," led by Professor Schmidt, completed the voyage from Arkhangelsk to Vladivostok, marking a major advance in Arctic exploration.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Emphasizes Northern Sea Route</p>
<p>Most of the Soviet Union's coastline borders the Arctic Ocean, so it is most concerned about the Arctic. The Arctic Institute was established. After Schmidt opened up the Arctic Ocean route in 1932, it further aroused the interest of Soviet explorers. Subsequently, the icebreaker "Ruk" reached Murmansk from Vladivostok in just 83 days. In 1937, another feat of aviation exploration was successfully achieved. From then on, the Arctic, once considered a fantasy, no longer seemed mysterious. At the same time, the management of the Arctic became more concrete. The Soviet Union then built ports on the Lena and Yenisei Rivers, established radio stations on various Arctic islands, and added more than 50 Arctic stations to carry out research and construction work. The Soviet Union spared no effort in the excavation and management of this new land, achieving great success in recent years.</p>
<p>Apart from the Baltic Sea in the West and the Sea of Okhotsk in the Far East, the rest of the Soviet Union's access to the outside world is surrounded by icebergs and cold currents. In the past, the Soviet Union had been striving to find several ports for trade with the world. The construction of the Northeast Railway and the opening of the shipping route, and the attempt to seize the Dardanelles Strait from Turkey, were all based on the perspective of transporting goods. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian fleet had to detour around the Cape of Good Hope to reach the Japanese coast, a case of distant water being unable to put out a nearby fire, and ultimately suffered defeat. Since then, a direct navigation route must be opened up in the north, so the management of the Arctic has major military and strategic significance.</p>
<p>International Situation Around the Arctic</p>
<p>The Arctic is an area surrounded by the three continents of Asia, Europe, and America. If the North Pole is taken as the center, and several radiating lines are drawn along the coasts of various countries, dividing this circular land, then the Soviet Union is directly facing the center at an angle of 160 degrees, occupying four-ninths of the circumference. Next is Canada, occupying one-quarter of the circumference, Greenland occupies one-sixth, the U.S. state of Alaska occupies one-twelfth, and Norway is even shorter than Alaska. This radial circle represents the situation of various countries competing in the Arctic.</p>
<p>In terms of aviation distance, the distance from New York as the center, northwest through Alaska, across Siberia to Moscow, is over 10,000 miles. Westward through San Francisco, across the Pacific Ocean to Tokyo, it will be nearly 9,000 miles, and if you go east to Shanghai, it will also reach 10,000 miles. If you take the Arctic route, the distance will be greatly shortened. The distance between New York and Moscow is only 4,800 miles, New York to Tokyo is 6,900 miles, and to Nanjing it is only 7,500 miles. Compared with continental flight, it can reduce the journey by a quarter or even more than half.</p>
<p>Will Become an Aviation Shortcut in the Future</p>
<p>Air power has exerted tremendous power in World War II, and the invention of atomic energy has further enhanced the effectiveness of air power. In the future, air power will be of greater importance in national defense and strategy. This airspace surrounded by the three continents of Asia, Europe, and America is a navigational shortcut and will soon replace the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean and become a densely populated area of ​​aviation networks. It is hoped that this place will become a major thoroughfare for the exchange of cultures and goods, and that the tragedies that have been played out in the Pacific will not be re-enacted here, defiling this pristine place with the evils of human civilization.</p>
<h3>President Ho Chi Minh Renews Call for Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 27th] Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh recently sent a letter to French President Auriol, asking him and the French people to declare their opinion on this senseless, bloody war. The letter, or perhaps Mr. Sainteny, the French Commissioner for Annam and Tonkin residing in Tokyo, will bring the letter back to Paris. The letter stated that the war is constantly increasing the suffering of Vietnam, and the French army's mission to restore peace and order is a lie, because there is no conflict where there are no French troops. We once again solemnly declare that our purpose is only unification and independence, and we are determined to respect the economic and cultural interests of France. America, as the pioneer of freedom, cannot fight against nations striving for basic rights. If France immediately orders a ceasefire, countless lives and property can be saved, and our friendship can be restored. Otherwise, France will lose everything and gain nothing. War only increases hatred on both sides. France may lack planes and tanks, but we have the firm will to back our reasonable demands. We do not believe that France is willing to continue this dishonorable war, so we ask the French government to clearly declare its policy towards the Viet Minh. Our purpose is clear, that is, to achieve unification and independence within the French Union, and we want a reasonable peace.</p>
<h3>International Monetary Fund to Begin Operations in March; Member Countries May Apply for Loans</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] IMF Managing Director Gutt announced today that the $7.5 billion International Monetary Fund will begin operations on March 1 to stabilize world currencies. Since May 6 of last year, the organization has established a secretariat, a review department, and a research department to study the economic conditions of member countries in detail. All member countries must pay their allocated amounts before March 1. Gutt will travel to London on March 22 to discuss plans for the Board of Governors meeting to be held in London in September with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton. It is reported that the IMF has 260 employees from 24 countries, including 176 from the United States and 6 from China.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] IMF Managing Director Gutt said yesterday that the Board of Directors' responsibilities, which are to maintain contact with member countries and guide them on the tasks they should fulfill to world organizations, are more important than managing the fund itself. He also said that member countries can borrow from the fund if they encounter urgent needs, but he hopes that borrowing will be kept to a minimum.</p>
<h3>McCloy to Succeed as President of the World Bank</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 26th] According to the Howard newspaper, former U.S. Assistant Secretary of War McCloy has accepted the position of President of the World Bank. The World Bank is composed of 40 countries, and the bank's former president, Meyer, resigned at the end of last month, so the bank has refused to issue any loans before a new president is appointed.</p>
<h3>American Scientists Discover the Secret to Longevity</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 27th] Kemp, director of Winthrop Laboratories, and Tanenbaum, director of the laboratory's research institute, jointly announced that their research on improving blood may extend human life to 125 or 150 years.</p>
<h3>To Our Readers</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's special New Medicine Supplement dates back fourteen years, named the Medical and Pharmaceutical Weekly. At that time, society and the medical community competed to expect this publication, and the contributors mostly wrote elaborate works. The author was fortunate to be associated with it. Later, it was edited by the Shanghai Medical Association and renamed "New Medicine and New Drugs," in order to standardize the name, until the war started and it was suspended. This is a brief history of this publication. Since the victory, the Medical Association has already been in charge of the People's Medical Journal. Now the Shen Bao has entrusted the responsibility of New Medicine and New Drugs to the Association, so it seems appropriate to call it a post-war restoration.</p>
<p>Having received this commission, we dare not fail to exhaust our thoughts to maintain the past honor and standing of this publication, and not to disgrace our mother publication. This is a wish that we share with all of you gentlemen.</p>
<p>Looking back at these fourteen years, the country has been tempered by the flames of war, and the people have learned from the lessons of war. To what extent has the promotion of scientific construction reached? What is the state of the scientific concepts that have been established and awakened? After examining this, one cannot help but feel saddened, and the duties of this publication are felt to be ten or a hundred times greater than in the past. This is a wish that we share with all of you to be vigilant about.</p>
<p>As for academic studies, they have no national boundaries, and culture should not be affected by partisan figures. We cherish the creations and efforts of the past, and we hope that those in the world who love this publication will continue to support it, and we further seek the resonance of all parties related to this publication. Sincerely written by Pang Jingzhou on February 19, the 36th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Medical Administration Forum</p>
<h3>Discussing the Physician Certification Renewal and Physician Law, and Questioning the Highest Health Administration Authority</h3>
<p>— Hua Xinren</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health recently published a notice for the re-registration and license renewal of physicians and prepared medicines. This work is very necessary. Because, how many doctors are there in our country? Even the highest Ministry of Health probably doesn't have an accurate answer. The reason for this, of course, reflects the Ministry of Health's lax management of medicine. In terms of personnel, this represents a kind of disorder, and in terms of management, it is unscientific. This license renewal also has its own internal contradiction, that is, the Ministry of Health has not grasped the regulations set by the Physician Law in the past. At the same time, there is also a sense of distress. That is, the issuance of license certificates in the past had some problems related to personal connections. Therefore, the current license renewal is used to make up for this defect. If we can really do well now, then it will be a success. Because it’s never too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost, right?</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health is the highest health nerve center in the country. Since the 17th year of the Republic of China to the present, it can be considered that the authorities have paid special attention to the fact that there is an independent health institution in our country's government departments. But where are the political achievements? The plague is prevalent everywhere, and the mortality rate is increasing as a percentage. There is a lack of health personnel, and the county-level health personnel are even more filled with incompetent people. The hospital equipment is incomplete, and there are too few beds... Does the health authority not admit these failures? Perhaps, the health authorities consider their success, or even think that they have contributed to today's medical and political construction, is the Physician Law promulgated by the National Government on September 22nd, 32nd year of the Republic of China. In fact, the result of this Physician Law is that the medical and political management has disintegrated, fragmented, and even stirred up an unbalanced situation between Chinese and Western medicine like the Sixteen Kingdoms of the Five Hus. If we analyze it scientifically, this kind of law can only be suitable for wartime organizations. Today, the Ministry of Health must feel it. The seriousness of the lack of medical talents, why can't the construction of public doctors be promoted? It is not about controlling it by re-registering and renewing certificates. There are many things to do, and the first thing is to revise the Physician Law. Revise it according to the current situation, social background, and what is truly helpful to the Chinese people. In other words, the Physician Law should be revised to become a regulation applicable to China. Don't aim too high, don't look for fish on trees, but look at the long-term perspective in a down-to-earth manner, and meet the needs of the people today. Refer to the scope indicated in Chairman Jiang's "Destiny of China" to formulate a good Physician Law. Otherwise, scientific medicine will inevitably collapse, and the political life of health administration will inevitably come to an end.</p>
<p>The first physician regulations in our country were the Provisional Regulations for Physicians promulgated by the Ministry of Health on January 15th, 18th year of the Republic of China, with a total of five chapters and twenty-five articles. At that time, the review of physician qualifications was conducted by a review committee organized by the Ministry of Health, which reviewed and issued certificates. Among them, the restrictions on physician qualifications are divided into four categories. In addition to those who passed the examination and those who obtained certificates abroad, the most important thing is that those who are over 20 years old and graduated from national or government-registered private medical colleges or above and obtained graduation certificates. Perhaps, at that time, there were very few medical schools, and the number of graduates was very small, so there were the above regulations. However, there was no mention of the certification of Chinese medicine practitioners. The second time was on September 22nd, 32nd year of the Republic of China, when it was promulgated by the National Government. The Physician Law promulgated this time is a formal law, because it went through the legislative procedures of the Legislative Yuan and was executed and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. This time, the Physician Law, with a total of six chapters and forty articles, deleted the general outline promulgated in the 18th year of the Republic of China, and changed the review committee of the Ministry of Health to "Citizens of the Republic of China who have passed the physician examination may serve as physicians," which invisibly weakened the Ministry of Health's independent review power and indirectly dealt a blow to the medical administration institutions. At the same time, it strengthened the restrictions on qualifications. That is, the examination for physicians is handled by the Examination Yuan in conjunction with the Executive Yuan. This means that the physician's certificate must first pass the Examination Yuan, and then the Ministry of Health completes the formalities. This Physician Law does everything possible to strictly manage Western medicine, but it humbly concedes to Chinese medicine everywhere. Let's take an example, the regulations in the first category of Article 3 of the Physician Law, such as: "Those who have obtained qualified certificates or medical practice licenses from the central competent authority or provincial and municipal governments," but we want to ask, on what basis did the central competent authority or provincial and municipal governments issue "qualified certificates" or "medical practice licenses"? In other words, according to which laws and regulations are these "qualified certificates" and "medical practice licenses" formulated? As citizens, we have the right to sue and question the Ministry of Health, what is "qualified," and where does this "qualified regulation" come from? Also, in the second paragraph: Those who have studied medicine in Chinese medicine schools and have excellent internship results and have graduation certificates. I don't know whether the so-called Chinese medicine schools studying medicine are the same as the regulations for Western medicine (public women or registered by the Ministry of Education)? I remember that last year the Ministry of Education instructed provinces and cities to crack down on Chinese medicine schools that were neither fish nor fowl, which shows that the operation of Chinese medicine schools is not good and the facilities are simple. May I ask, can this kind of internship be considered excellent results? The education authorities can understand the inside story of Chinese medicine education and take measures to crack down on it for the sake of the nation's health future. This kind of treatment is quite appropriate. However, when the Ministry of Health formulated the Physician Law in the first place, why didn't they think of this? Is it hatred for Western medicine or giving gifts to Chinese medicine? The most absurd thing is the third paragraph of Article 3 of the Physician Law: "Those who have practiced Chinese medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputation." Obviously, this is an insult and destruction to scientific medicine. Chinese medicine practitioners only need "five years," but why can't Western medicine practitioners do the same? Is it that the theory and experience of Western medicine cannot catch up with the science of Chinese medicine? At the same time, it is even more difficult to give a boundary to "outstanding reputation." Is posting thank-you notes in newspapers and bragging considered outstanding reputation? Is introducing people considered outstanding reputation? Anyone with a little bit of common sense knows that this is a trick. Enough, this Physician Law drafted by the wartime Ministry of Health has 100% proved that it is driving the leadership of science backward, merely stimulating the disputes between Chinese and Western medicine, and disrupting the medical and political system. Thoroughly speaking, it is a complete failure.</p>
<p>Medical certificates can be divided into four categories in total. The earliest one is a "Special" certificate, and only a few people have received it. The second type is a "Medical" certificate, and most of them are graduates of formal medical schools. The third category is a "General" certificate, which is a kind of expedient measure for those who passed the examination held by the Ministry of Health in the 18th year of the Republic of China. The fourth category is a "Verified" certificate. During the war, because people needed to read and use it, the Ministry of Health came up with another method, recruiting some people with insufficient academic qualifications to serve for two years before issuing certificates. Because of the difference between these four words, there is a clear distinction in the medical field. Similarly, there is also a distinction between "I am above you." With proof of identity, it is easier to select true talents. However, recently, the Ministry of Health, regardless of the original policy, issued uniform medical certificates, treating everyone equally. In this way, it will inevitably make the management of the entire medical system more difficult in the future. That is, how to distinguish between formal doctors with sufficient academic qualifications and some parvenus and opportunists in terms of identity? Are graduates of formal medical schools willing to enjoy the same treatment as those without academic qualifications? Therefore, this time's license renewal, in addition to increasing personnel disputes, actually shows that the Ministry of Health's medical administration is a kind of unscientific management. I think the medical association should discuss this point.</p>
<p>Due to the provisions of the Physician Law, which stifled the progress of scientific medicine, the serious fact currently facing the health authorities is that during the war, there were quite a few people who participated in the military service and were appointed as physicians in formal hospitals, but did not receive physician certificates due to insufficient academic qualifications. How should the Ministry of Health deal with this matter to properly settle it? Should they take the exam? This means that their qualifications are not recognized. But why could they hold the position of physician during the war? Is it just to take advantage of them? At the very least, it's better than "practicing medicine for five years" and having an "outstanding reputation," right? At the same time, in this re-registration and license renewal, the Ministry of Health did not point out how to deal with "those who participated in enemy and puppet work"? We have some doubts. What about the Minister of Health of the puppet organization? What about the president of the puppet Central Hospital? However, we must not forget that people in the health field have "integrity." They participated in the eight-year war of resistance and lived a life of enduring hardship. After the victory, there should be a distinction between them and those treacherous doctors who participated in the puppet organization and were afraid of death. Otherwise, how can we be worthy of the medical colleagues who sacrificed their lives? To preserve our "righteousness," treacherous doctors must not be our companions.</p>
<p>The health administration authorities cannot bury their heads in the sand like ostriches to escape reality, but bravely face reality. Because what our compatriots urgently need is a practical health care undertaking. Clever theories and pleasant plans cannot cover up the people's discerning eyes. Franklin said, "One way a man may be sure he is neglecting his civic duty is when he begins to whitewash his public blunders." Therefore, I hope that the health authorities can know where to improve. As the saying goes, it is not annoying to use a straightforward way to make people work hard. If things are not fair, they will make a sound. This is the original intention of the author in writing this article.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The author of this article is a relatively progressive physician and also a worker working in a public health agency. This article purely objectively criticizes a part of the Physician Law. It is really a discussion of "the wise see wisdom and the benevolent see benevolence." Especially in the Ministry of Health, which recently issued the order of "re-registration and license renewal of medical personnel," it is really worth reading. Therefore, it is specially published here, and I hope that medical colleagues at home and abroad will discuss it together.</p>
<h3>The Physiology and Hygiene of the Circulatory System (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>The word "circulation," literally, means continuous dwelling and revolving. Then, isn't this "circulatory system" the organs in the body that are constantly dwelling and revolving? We want to ask, in the human body, what exactly is this thing that is constantly dwelling and revolving? Who is it for that it is dwelling and revolving so constantly? In the human body, the thing that revolves and dwells day and night, to say it, everyone understands, is "blood." The revolving and continuous flow of this blood has a certain track, and this track is called "blood vessels." Therefore, the blood inside the blood vessels is like the water in the river. These kinds of blood vessels in the body are also divided into arteries, capillaries, and so on. Who is the blood residing in these blood vessels constantly dwelling and flowing for? In other words, what is the working task of its flowing and moving?</p>
<p>The movement of muscles relies on taking the nourishing substances of food and the oxygen in the air to exchange the waste substances accumulated in the muscles. This kind of work also has a scientific name, called "metabolism." However, the organ that mainly nourishes food is the digestive system, and the organ that mainly exchanges air is the respiratory system, such as the lungs. If there are no organs in the middle to perform the work of mutual contact and interconnection, then the air in the lungs and the nourishing substances in the stomach and intestines will have no way to be distributed to the whole body. The circulating task of the flowing and moving blood in the blood vessels is to specialize in a kind of contact work and interconnection work that carries the exchange of air in the lungs and the nourishing substances in the stomach and intestines to the whole body.</p>
<p>Let's use a metaphor to talk about the working condition of the whole body's blood circulation. It's like the railways and highways of a country. A country relies on the railways and highways as transportation to transport goods from the east to the west and move people and horses from the south to the north; otherwise, if a country does not have railways and highways, it will feel the inconvenience of transportation. This country, especially in the modern 20th century, will not be a country. Similarly, the human body has the work of blood circulation, so that the material nutrition in the body can have active work, in order to maintain a person's life. If the human body does not have this work of blood circulation for a day, the result, as everyone knows, is that it will immediately die. The reason is actually so simple that it doesn't need me to explain it.</p>
<p>Let's go back and say a few words about the blood, which is the main body of the circulation work.</p>
<p>Blood is spread throughout any part of the human body; therefore, the proportion of the amount of skin and body in any part: for ordinary adults, it accounts for one-thirteenth of the total weight; newborns have a little more, and the larger ones account for about one-nineteenth. The composition of blood is due to the liquid "plasma" and the solid "blood cells." These solid blood cells are divided into two types: "red blood cells" and "white blood cells." White blood cells are much larger than red blood cells, but the number is not as large as red blood cells: about the ratio of five hundred to one, that is, for every five hundred red blood cells, there is one white blood cell. The lifespan of these white blood cells is very short: about twenty days or so, they will die; after the old blood cells die, the blood cell manufacturing plants—bone marrow, lymph glands, spleen, and other manufacturers—will continue to manufacture new blood cells to supplement and replace them.</p>
<h3>Review of the Treatment of Tuberculosis with "Streptomycin" (2)</h3>
<p>— Yang Shida</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things felt from the five surviving patients is that their previous progressive symptoms have been prevented by "Streptomycin," at least temporarily. One of them, who only suffered from miliary tuberculosis without minor meningitis, showed significant progress in both clinical and X-ray aspects after two months of treatment. The other four who had significant signs of meningitis including daily symptoms (fever, coma, headache, neck stiffness) and pathological spinal fluid and finding tubercle bacilli, all got good effects from "Streptomycin." This fact seems to prove that "Streptomycin" has considerable efficacy and is not prone to errors. In the past, H. Corwin Hinshaw had tried to treat this disease with other drugs, but had never found such an effect.</p>
<p>The relief of symptoms can be found after one to two weeks of treatment; after two to three weeks, the body temperature gradually decreases, and from the start of treatment, the body temperature can return to normal after four to eight weeks. At the same time, the patient feels generally comfortable, and coma, headache, and neck stiffness also disappear one after another. The phenomenon of spinal fluid, the relief of pathological conditions is very slow. During the treatment period, although the clinical symptoms gradually disappear, the spinal fluid always presents a more or less improper state. In the patients treated by Ying Xiao, only two spinal fluids almost returned to normal, but tubercle bacilli disappeared after a few weeks of treatment, and there was no way to prove its existence. This pathological state of spinal fluid, the fact that it cannot be completely eliminated (increased cells and protein and decreased sugar), although the existence of tubercle bacilli cannot be proved by the inoculation method, it should be considered that the infection may still exist. Among Ying’s five patients, three have been treated for six months and are under close observation. Two have maintained a good condition for two and three months. One patient relapsed one month after the treatment was stopped, and the treatment was continued again. This patient has lived for two more months since the recurrence, and has lived for ten more months since the start of treatment. However, all current cures are still not very reliable, and it will take a long time before these patients can be listed as "cured."</p>
<p>The pathological conditions left in the nervous system, three of the four patients with meningitis symptoms had it. One became blind due to tuberculous optic neuritis, and the other became deaf. Whether the cause of deafness is related to "Streptomycin" is still questionable (because "Streptomycin" often has side effects on the auditory organs). The third patient had a deep pathological condition in the cerebellum. The remaining patients have been treated for five months, maintaining a good condition, and can come to the outpatient clinic for treatment. Before the treatment, they did show severe meningitis symptoms.</p>
<p>Cooke and his collaborators have reported that "Streptomycin" stopped the progress of meningitis. There were six other similar reports, and private individuals have provided them to Ying Xiao.</p>
<p>The method Chen used to treat his four patients was to inject one hundred to two hundred cc through lumbar or cerebellomedullary cistern puncture every twenty-four or forty-eight hours for about two to six weeks. At the same time, intramuscular injections were performed, 2-3 cc per day, continuing for six weeks. After that, long-term observation was added. All those who died did not receive spinal injections, and all those who received spinal injections did not die.</p>
<p>In the treatment of tuberculous meningitis, extremely large doses of "Streptomycin" are injected intramuscularly and spinal cord in separate ways for a long time. Often such therapy can achieve at least several weeks or months of clinical effects. Regarding the early diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis, it is necessary to travel with extremely large doses of "Streptomycin" for intramuscular injections. Clinical, X-ray, and pathological tissue cures are possible, but according to the treatment experience of Ying Xiao et al., it cannot be confirmed. The treatment results of other types of tuberculosis will be discussed later when there is an opportunity! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Regarding Several Questions About Smallpox Vaccination</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Several people have written to inquire about the procedure, advantages, and disadvantages of smallpox vaccination. I feel it is valuable to provide a comprehensive response, so I am addressing these letters first among the many received. Moreover, as smallpox is currently prevalent, and health authorities are repeatedly urging everyone to get vaccinated, this work can be considered timely.</p>
<p>We all know that smallpox vaccination is a very common thing, and we think it doesn't matter if it's done casually. However, some new parents are always worried and can't help but ask many questions: "When can smallpox vaccination be done?" "Should the first smallpox vaccination be done immediately after birth?" "What are the side effects of smallpox vaccination?" "Can smallpox vaccination prevent all other infectious diseases?" "After smallpox vaccination, should 'heating' foods be eaten to help the process?" These questions may seem trivial, but they are actually reasonable. I will answer each item as follows:</p>
<p>(1) "When can smallpox vaccination be done?" Many doctors advocate vaccinating children immediately after birth to prevent smallpox infection in advance. This reason is certainly correct. However, we should understand that smallpox vaccination (especially the first vaccination) is not a trivial matter. From the first day of vaccination until the scab falls off and it heals, it takes a full ten days or half a month. Moreover, the first vaccination is simply like causing a child to have a non-fatal infectious disease. If the child is not healthy, or if the child already has a disease, then smallpox vaccination can cause an adverse accident. Therefore, I must advise new parents: If you want your child to be vaccinated against smallpox, then first see if your child is healthy. If there is a cold, cough, or diarrhea, as well as eczema and other symptoms on the skin, then only wait for it to heal before vaccinating. Otherwise, it will only increase the burden on the child, worsen his condition, or make him prone to other diseases. Someone vaccinated a child with eczema, and as a result, the child developed eczema and pox all over his body, which was extremely dangerous. This must be known.</p>
<p>(2) "Should the first smallpox vaccination be done immediately after birth?" In Germany, doctors advocate that smallpox vaccination should absolutely not be done within four months after a child is born. First, because the child gets very little immunity from the mother and rarely suffers from smallpox. Second, because they are afraid that the child's resistance is too weak and cannot bear the arduous work of smallpox vaccination. This reason is quite reasonable. However, if smallpox is prevalent in a certain area, then all children in this area (except for sick children) must be vaccinated and can no longer be delayed.</p>
<p>(3) "What are the side effects of smallpox vaccination?" In the normal course of smallpox vaccination, some fever, restlessness, and diarrhea are not surprising. Some redness, swelling, blisters, pustules, and scabs at the vaccination site are all normal conditions and do not need to be worried about. However, if the vaccination site is abnormally swollen, or the redness and swelling turns purple-black and even forms a large abscess, and there is a high fever, then that is an adverse side effect. It is mostly due to incomplete disinfection during vaccination, resulting in the transmission of other germs (such as streptococcus or staphylococcus, etc.), and a doctor must be consulted for treatment.</p>
<p>Some children develop high fever and convulsions after smallpox vaccination, which may be a symptom of encephalitis and also require medical treatment, because it is the most dangerous disease.</p>
<p>(4) "Can smallpox vaccination prevent all other infectious diseases?" Many people think that smallpox vaccination can prevent other infectious diseases, which is absolutely impossible. However, I must tell readers that although smallpox vaccination cannot directly prevent other infectious diseases, it can enhance the body's immunity. Because experience tells us that after smallpox vaccination, many minor ailments are often reduced as a result.</p>
<p>(5) "After smallpox vaccination, should 'heating' foods be eaten?" In the folk, there is often a custom of giving so-called "heating" foods after smallpox vaccination, hoping that the smallpox will come out sooner. In fact, this is superfluous, and even if you eat "heating" foods, it does not necessarily come out sooner. We did not give him "heating" foods, and the results were often very good. So, this "heating" food can be avoided.</p>
<p>However, I must mention one point for clarification, perhaps because the previous smallpox vaccination procedure was incomplete, the smallpox vaccine was not pure, or because there was diarrhea during smallpox vaccination, so certain easily digestible foods were specially selected to reduce the burden on the child.</p>
<p>That's all for several questions about smallpox vaccination.</p>

<p>Viewing Hangzhou from a Purely Cultural Perspective - A Reporter Asks Mr. Xiong Foxi: Hangzhou Should Be a Cultural Capital - Buddhist Texts Truly Call Hangzhou a Transformation City</p>
<p>Spring, although its effects have already been noticed, quietly and secretly arrived on the shores of West Lake, but it pretends to be shy, half-covered and half-revealed, appearing and disappearing. These few days, it seems it can no longer bear it, revealing its clear and lovely self. The good sun covers the lake and valleys, wildflowers bloom in abundance, and the warm wind brings the fragrance of the soil. Streams and birds play together "the Song of Spring's Return."</p>
<p>Cars bring men and women from Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, and other places to explore the spring, and playwright Mr. Xiong Foxi and Miss Ye Zi also came at the right time. They came to see the reporter and only stayed for a day and a half. We went to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon to play in the water, strolled along Bai Causeway, explored the sacredness of Jingci Temple, tasted the spring at Hupao, overlooked the Qiantang River from the Liuhe Pagoda, and also paid respects at the Tomb of Yue Fei. To see the plum blossoms, we went to Gushan, but the effects were still shy and unwilling to be seen. Professor Zhang Junchuan from Zhejiang University said: "The plum blossoms in Lingfeng have already bloomed." So, we went to Lingfeng again. It is located on the road to Wangquan Temple. We hurried forward, bypassing a small hillside. A hint of green bamboo revealed half a corner of the red wall. Climbing the steps, we entered the temple gate on the left. There was a small plum grove, which had indeed bloomed with several branches, and the fragrance filled the entire courtyard.</p>
<p>Many Literary Figures Captivated by West Lake</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong Foxi said to the reporter: "Hangzhou is truly too beautiful; it should be the cultural capital." Yes, Hangzhou should truly be the cultural capital! It is located on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, and every day there is a direct train to Nanjing. It is surrounded by the Qiantang River and guarded by the Grand Canal. It is a land of fish and rice and also the home of aquatic vegetables. It has vast acres of fertile land and mulberry trees. It maintains a simple and honest style.</p>
<p>Many literary figures have bowed down for the beauty of West Lake in Hangzhou. Bai Juyi of the Tang Dynasty built a levee here to irrigate water conservancy. Later generations built Bai Causeway on West Lake in memory of him. Qian Miao of the late Tang Dynasty and early Song Dynasty gained the aura of the lake and mountains and maintained the safety of Liangzhe during the war. To this day, the Qian Gong Temple still stands on the shores of the lake, which is the scenic spot of Orioles Singing in the Willows. Su Shi of the Song Dynasty built Su Causeway on the lake. In spring, the six bridges are filled with misty willows, and the scenery is pleasant. Lin Hejing released cranes on Gushan, and the story of the plum blossom wife and crane son also originated on West Lake. During the Southern Song Dynasty, the poet prostitute Su Xiaoxiao's fragrant bones were buried by the Xiling Bridge, and even today, many people are captivated and pay their respects. During the Song Dynasty, Ge Hong refined elixirs on the Chuyang Terrace of Ge Ling. During the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Zhuanglie (i.e., Chongzhen) lived by West Lake. To this day, Hangzhou's "Lord Zhu Da Tianjun Bodhisattva" incense is most prosperous, which is to commemorate him. During the Qing Dynasty, Yu Quyuan lectured between Su Causeway and Bai Causeway. Kang Youwei once lingered in the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon of Xiaoyingzhou. Since the Republic of China, Su Manshu has been buried at the foot of Gushan. Wu Changshuo and others initiated the establishment of the Xiling Seal Carving Society on the Outer West Lake. Qiu Jin is also buried next to the Tomb of Yue Fei. Even the late Mr. Ye Chucang's dying wish was to be buried on the shores of West Lake.</p>
<p>Literary Style Once Flourishing, Now Decayed</p>
<p>In the past, Hangzhou's literary style was considered flourishing. There were Chongwen, Fuwen, and Ziyang academies, as well as the Gujing Jingshe for archeology and the Xiaoliantang for discussing articles. Even the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, preserved in the current Provincial Library, was copied and completed by many persevering people on West Lake.</p>
<p>Hangzhou has been a land of cultural relics in history, but now its content feels withered and decayed. Some say: "This is a political factor." Others say: "This is because the scenery is too gentle and beautiful, which makes people lack the courage to explore." I discussed this matter with Mr. Xiong Foxi and others for a long time. The conclusion we reached is that politics and scenery are not important factors. Hangzhou can still be the cultural capital of China. Because it is quiet, suitable for writers to write. It is beautiful, without the atmosphere of the market. It has convenient transportation, which can communicate all outside cultures. Moreover, there are dozens of printing houses in Hangzhou. Although the printing skills are not as good as Shanghai's, if true cultural people stay in Hangzhou and guide them, they may surpass Shanghai. At the same time, although the cost of living in Hangzhou is generally high, due to the simplicity of the citizens, the expenses are often much lower than in Shanghai. Although there is also a housing panic, the degree is much lighter than in Shanghai. It is a large park, and when you have nothing to do, you can row a boat on the lake or stroll along the causeway. Poor but noble cultural figures who love nature and need spiritual comfort should take Hangzhou as their home.</p>
<p>Academic Institutions - Hoping for a Large-Scale Relocation</p>
<p>Because of our sincere enthusiasm, Mr. Xiong will lead his theater school students to Hangzhou in mid-spring for a performance. At that time, he also wants to invite some well-known figures from the cultural world to Hangzhou. Of course, this is just a cultural activity. There is still a long way to go to build a cultural capital. However, we must have such a passionate expectation, we must shout so enthusiastically. Due to our expectations and shouts, we believe that we will definitely arouse people's attention.</p>
<p>We also hope that those who lead the whole country, lead Zhejiang, and lead Hangzhou must see through the position of Hangzhou in cultural value. We believe that it is not enough to build a garden city, and it is not enough to build an Oriental Hollywood. It should be built as a cultural city. In this regard, hard work will make Hangzhou full and rich, making people reluctant to leave. Therefore, many new academic institutions that the country wants to establish should be located in Hangzhou. Many universities that have no regional distinctions in name should be moved to Hangzhou. Even the Roosevelt Library, which is to be set up recently, we also have the necessity of requesting the Changju to consider relocating it to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Looking around the country, Beijing originally had the reputation of a cultural city, but this was in the north, and at that time, it was only because of the political capital that literati gathered here. Now, many Beijing literati have come to the southeast. They are cramped in cramped rooms, breathing coal ash every day, and are familiar with the abacus calculations of brokers. Their thinking territory is so constrained by a family's livelihood that they can't breathe. Even if they have great ambitions and great writing, they are limited by the real environment.</p>
<p>Cultural figures are engineers of the human soul and jewels on the crown of the country. We must cherish them. We must choose good places and arrange homes for them.</p>
<p>Recent Developments in the Repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway - A Report from Wuyuan on the 17th</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is 1,008 li long, and with the Nanchang-Xunyang Line, it is 1,130 kilometers long. During the war, only the section from Shangrao to Jiangshan could barely be used. After the victory, the section from Hangzhou to Gaixia has been accepted and opened to traffic. Eighty percent of the entire line has not yet been repaired. This repair project was previously approved by the Ministry of Communications to repair Jinhua to Gaixia, Zhuzhou to Pingxiang first, but only one-third has been completed. The previously allocated funds have been exhausted and are insufficient, and a supplementary budget has been requested.</p>
<p>The main materials required to repair the railway are trains, rails, and sleepers. For the train item, it will be transported from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Jiangxi. The steps for the project are to first repair the Zhuzhou-Pingxiang, Nanchang-Xunyang, and Zhuji-Jinhua sections. The road surfaces with excessive curvature and unfavorable driving conditions will be renovated. As for bridges and culverts, the original foundation will be used as much as possible.</p>
<p>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Office in China, in order to assist in the repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, must first survey the entire line to understand the actual situation. The industrial rehabilitation engineer of the office, He Yier (K.V. Hoyer), etc., have drafted a rehabilitation plan, which will be assisted by the office. If the supply of materials and engineering is sufficient, it is expected to complete the entire line by the end of the year. (Ning Po)</p>

<h3>A Discourse on Cats</h3>
<p>— Mingchun</p>
<p>On February 7th, I read a "Cat Story" in a certain newspaper, and I was delighted to learn about the news of an old friend I hadn't seen for many years. Unfortunately, the content was all about foreign cat stories, such as Napoleon hating cats and Wellington loving cats. The only flaw was that the article still retained some unfamiliar words that could not be found in the English dictionary. I used to love these little animals. Let me talk about the cat stories I know.</p>
<p>The Book of Odes says: "There are tigers and cats." This animal has had a long history with the Chinese. It is strange that cats are not among the six domestic animals of "horses, cows, sheep, geese, dogs, and pigs." Moreover, the twelve zodiac animals discussed by Wang Chong, such as "rat for Zi, ox for Chou, tiger for Yin, rabbit for Mao…" do not have their place. So, we don't have people born under the sign of the cat. Not only that, "chickens and dogs are restless," indicating that cats are not the object of pity. "Singing, dancing, dogs, and horses" indicates that cats are not the object of love. While cats certainly cannot compete with dragons and tigers, the twelve zodiac animals have the status of hateful rats, scary snakes, and pitiful pigs, but no cat, which is somewhat unjust. If it is said that the presence or absence of cats is irrelevant to life, just imagine if they take a half-year vacation, wouldn't the rampant mice only be playing hide-and-seek by your pillow?</p>
<p>The Qing scholar Liu Xianting said that even immortals, Buddhas, ghosts, and gods have luck and misfortune, and that the reason is incomprehensible. He did not yet know that the fate of animals is also the same.</p>
<p>Cats can indeed develop feelings for people, but they are definitely not as loyal as dogs, following every step and listening to people's orders. Therefore, there are many loyal dogs but few loyal cats. Their personalities are stubborn, they love freedom, and catching mice is only half-hearted. They often eat the owner's food and catch the neighbor's mice. It is beautiful in the selfish view of human beings, so it is difficult to please the masters.</p>
<p>Many cats have developed feelings for me. I allow them to sleep next to my couch and "recite sutras." I often put my fingers into their mouths and let them bite as much as they want. They squat, look up, and sit, biting in various ways, but the force they use is moderate, and their fangs never pierce my skin. They also let me touch the fine thorns on their tongues.</p>
<p>They can be trained. Once, I was walking in a water town and found a boat of river and lake performers parked by the lake. A beautiful calico cat stood on the bow of the boat. I asked the boat owner: "When you dock in the water, isn't it difficult for the cat to urinate and defecate?" The boat owner proudly pointed to a large bamboo tube hanging at the stern of the boat and said: "That is the cat's toilet." He continued: "Cats on the boat never defecate anywhere; they always go to their special toilet and never make a mistake. This is the result of long-term training." Another time, I was eating a vegetarian banquet in a famous wealthy nunnery. Before the guests were seated, a small calico cat suddenly jumped onto the corner of the table, without making a sound or moving, and stared at the food dish on the table, without moving forward a step, as if it had come specially to visit. I took a piece of peanut candy from the dish and gave it to her, and she ate it elegantly at the corner of the table. "Er Zhu, um, good, come down!" a nun called her name, and she responded and jumped down.</p>
<p>The cats in this nunnery all have names, and the nuns can casually call a certain cat to do a certain action. For example, "San Shi, come up on my shoulder," and the cat named San Shi would jump onto the shoulder of the caller.</p>
<p>Another feature is that the cats in this nunnery are all vegetarians.</p>
<p>Bai Juyi said it well, "One can love small things." Indeed, all animals, including people, are always cute when they are young. Before cats learn to catch mice, they love to play the most. They can chase a withered flower blowing in the wind on the steps, catching it back and forth, seven times captured and seven times released, and continue jumping for more than an hour. Unfortunately, once they learn to catch mice, they become lazy in playing, just like a child grows up to an age where he understands things, has other desires, and is unwilling to play for the sake of playing.</p>
<p>I have observed the nature of many cats and found that they, like humans, also have innate intelligence and stupidity. Some are greedy by nature and do not keep to their duties. When eating, they are rude, and even climb into the food bowl with their front feet, desperately squeezing, making it impossible for their companions to insert. They even grab the fish mixed in the rice, dodge under the bookcase, and chew alone, making a whining demonstration in their mouths, strongly telling other cats not to get close to the rice bowl. That look is more imperialistic than Hitler. Some cats have very good eating habits, love cleanliness, and do not snatch food, and have a gentlemanly demeanor.</p>
<p>Cats are fond of fighting, especially in the cold winter, often fighting for love and jealousy, causing their fur to fly and their skin to break, resulting in mutual injury. They are irreconcilable and die hard to the end, unlike humans who fight and make peace. Some cats are isolated from other cats, forming their own sphere of influence, and suspicion arises when they meet, often causing fights. It is inferred that nations with little contact with the outside world are an ominous phenomenon.</p>
<p>Cats also pay attention to blood relations, but once their children can live independently, they no longer ask each other, which is quite similar to the family system of an industrial society.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the more beautiful ones, such as the tricolor lion cats, are less able to catch mice. This is the same as the fact that decent "public servants" or "vases" in the human world cannot take on complex tasks.</p>
<p>The skills of cats catching mice vary greatly. There are stupid people who "carve a boat to seek a sword," and there are silly cats who "guard the hole and wait for the mouse." The spirited cat can monitor the jumping clown from more than ten feet away. With only a straight tail, it quietly draws a few circles, and then makes a shrinking and jumping posture, and the mouse is frightened and falls on its own. The principle is quite like the military exercises of a strong country.</p>
<p>To love the people by cherishing one's own relatives, to love things by being kind to the people, raising cats for leisure and catching mice at the same time is a win-win situation. It is a pity that in an era of chaos, people's own survival is threatened, and seeing the world, people have gradually regarded relatives as strangers and people as grass, and cats and dogs of different kinds have long been outside the circle of concern.</p>
<h3>Snippets on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Lanben</p>
<p>Poetry may be an art of gaming, but at least it is a serious game, a game of truth, goodness, and beauty.</p>
<p>The method of creation is to constantly select, constantly allocate, and constantly update.</p>
<p>The process of creation is the completion of self-criticism, self-expression, and self-experience.</p>
<h3>Remembrance</h3>
<p>— Yin Xueman</p>
<p>In the summer of 1938, I stayed in a small town in southern Shaanxi. Because this small town was nestled between the Qinling and Bashan Mountains, its climate was somewhat like that of Jiangnan. In June and July, days of intermittent sunshine and rain were common. However, we group of unrestrained and carefree young people, who would have been in the mood to plan for this? Therefore, within a quarter of an hour of leaving the house, I was caught in a downpour, and although I took shelter under someone's eaves, I was still drenched like a drowned chicken.</p>
<p>I can't remember why, but I needed to take a trip to the principal's house. At this time, although I hadn't considered my appearance or manners, and resolutely strode into an alley, I didn't expect that when I was almost at the principal's door, I was stopped by the sudden issue of appearance and manners.</p>
<p>In the misty drizzle, two beautiful figures walked ahead, and although their faces and hair were shadowed under a purple umbrella, I could deduce that they were beautiful. Especially that crimson cheongsam, it gave me infinite attraction.</p>
<p>I saw them standing in front of a door, the very door of the old principal's house.</p>
<p>Tap tap...</p>
<p>The sound of knocking on the door made me stop. I looked at myself, looked at them, and without hesitation, turned and fled from that deep alley.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the spring of 1939 that I had another chance to meet her, the girl in the crimson cheongsam. She was the younger sister of my classmate ×. × introduced us, and I brought up that scene from the summer of 1938. She said:</p>
<p>"Really? I didn't know! Otherwise, I would have taken a good look at your honorable appearance."</p>
<p>What a sharp tongue! I thought to myself. But I still smiled at her.</p>
<p>That was our first official meeting.</p>
<p>After that, time carried away five springs. In those five springs, we didn't forget each other. But unexpectedly, when the sixth spring came, I had already become a parent.</p>
<p>Are there some emotions? Being young, it's naturally not right to be emotional. But if someone has no longing or memory of the past, isn't that also unreasonable?</p>
<p>Therefore, it made me think about how different ideals and reality are.</p>
<p>Which young people don't have ideals? But the mistake isn't ours, even though we didn't build our ideals on reality. Because ideals and reality are too far apart, the result is inevitably that ideals become fantasies. But think about it, how much trauma can fantasies bring us?</p>
<p>In the past, we used to draw beautiful pictures of our ideals on moonlit nights. But the sad thing is that this society actually rejected the America drawn by ideals! Making ideals and life mutually destructive, so the ending for those who cling to life is always the same, and that is to throw the America of ideals into the dust of reality, letting it seal and shatter!</p>
<p>She left that small city that was both enchanting and tiring before I did. It was in the summer of 1940, when the fragrance of locust flowers still lingered in the green fields. Although separation made us sad, because we were pursuing that little bit of hope with a strong sense of fantasy, we finally held back our tears, smiled, shook hands, and said goodbye, parting on the dusty highway.</p>
<p>But just like a legendary novel describes, her experience is a moving story. The war made her dedicate unparalleled enthusiasm, making her escape her warm family and join a youth-organized work team, enduring the wind and dew, tasting unimaginable hardships. But unexpectedly, she was hit head-on! The work team disbanded due to lack of support and financial exhaustion; she had no choice but to come to this small city in the rear with a wounded heart.</p>
<p>I will always remember that group of young people, she said softly with a tone of contemplation and recollection: "They were young, enthusiastic, brave and lovely; but society didn't want them!"</p>
<p>I leaned silently beside her, gazing sadly at the night sky.</p>
<p>"What about the future?" she suddenly grabbed me and said loudly. "Hey, what's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>I smiled at her. She continued, "I'm thinking of going to the countryside to teach, to do something practical, what do you think?" She looked at me happily after speaking.</p>
<p>"I grew up in the countryside. People in the countryside don't even have enough to eat, how can they have time to study?"</p>
<p>"There's a way," she said confidently, "work and study at the same time! I hope to support my plan with small-scale chemical industries."</p>
<p>"Do you really want to do that?" I was a little incredulous.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I saw her face change. She said angrily, "You still don't believe me?" After speaking, she pushed me away and ran away regardless.</p>
<p>Compared to the past, we are much stronger today. Isn't it true that a young person initially has only unlimited enthusiasm, like anyone else, the tribulations of society will gradually make him stronger, no longer as empty as before. But when we accidentally meet on the street six years later and are shocked to learn that we have all become fathers, when we look at each other silently, those moonlit nights, those Qing talks, aren't they all as vague and distant as dreams?</p>
<p>Who is to blame? Is it that one's own willpower is not strong enough, one's aspirations are not firm enough? Or is it that one shouldn't have been so foolish in the past to draw one's own ideal picture; causing us to face each other silently today, our faces flushed red?</p>
<p>"Look, am I old?" she said.</p>
<p>I smiled. "Still very young!"</p>
<p>She glared at me fiercely. "Look how old my kids are!"</p>
<p>"Then, look at them!" I touched her child's head.</p>
<h3>Whitman Handbook</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Recently, Gay Wilson Allen published a book "Walt Whitman Handbook." Now, even in the United States, I'm afraid few people read Whitman's poems, and not many families have Whitman's "Leaves of Grass." Poe and even Emerson's poems have been reprinted, but Whitman is only occasionally selected by anthologists.</p>
<p>Naturally, he should be included in the ranks of famous writers. But besides young people with passionate interests, who else would be willing to read it! Only composers still use his poems to sing, and university poetry classes still read his poems.</p>
<p>Allen mentions in this Whitman handbook that Whitman is truly a poet of the world, and he has had a great influence on various countries. Poets from England, France, Germany, Russia, and South America have all been influenced by him. His reputation outside the United States is equal to that of Goethe, Hugo, or Tolstoy. The French symbolists also worshipped him. Gide thanked him for saving his mental breakdown, making him feel the unity of all creation. In Germany, before the First World War, Whitman almost became an idol in the cultural world. Thomas Mann said in 1920 that his works were influenced by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.</p>
<p>Everyone knows to compare Whitman with Rossetti and Swinburne. But people wouldn't think of Tawden and Sanjivali praising Whitman. Wang Er, Romain, and Gide's praise is also understandable, as for Laforge and Duhamel being Whitmanesque, no one would think of it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chapter 6, "Whitman and World Literature," was the best written, and the other five chapters are also readable. There are extremely many reference books; named handbook, its value is really above the handbook. From Oconnor in 1866 to Canby in 1943, he collected all the biographies for comparison. He also translated and used the comments of the Danish writer Frederik Schyberg, which are especially valuable after he introduced them for the first time. He also used many versions of Leaves of Grass, up to the seventh edition in 1882.</p>
<p>Allen also narrates Whitman's basic concepts and social thoughts, but he is very careful not to let his narrative of thinkers take up too much space. He wrote Whitman as the sum of many forces, which is why materialists, idealists, naturalists, nationalists, socialists, and symbolists all praise him. He motivates the joy and courage of others.</p>
<p>In terms of rhythm, Whitman followed the writers of the nineteenth century, experimenting with organic rhythms, as Arnold, Tennyson, and others tried. His poems, as Bradley showed, have a harmonious rhythm, unlike recent free poems that are too indulgent. There are many ways to do this, which is learned from the Bible. Longer poems even use operatic techniques, and he almost became a composer himself. Allen's chapter on Whitman's skills is also well written. Unfortunately, two points were overlooked by Allen: one is symbolism, and the other is imagination.</p>
<h3>Remaining Words of the Double Jade Studio</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Figures are like water plants on the bank, the mountains and rivers are in the sounds of drums of war; It is good to chant "Liangfu Yin", but do not write in vain, the charming reds and tender greens are the spring breeze before the eyes. Appreciate the intimate feelings, the conduct is all the same, the sorrow of parting is not like the water flowing east. May I ask how many times the moon will be full before we meet again?</p>
<p>A Ladle of Pearls</p>
<p>Leisurely watching the morning sun beside the pillow, gradually gathering towards the window, today's wind and rain should have no basis; Check the kit, pack up the spring travel phrases. Buy wine and leisurely search for the path by the stream, the spring waves are greener than when I crossed before, the water fields are vast and the seagulls fly; I also forget to return, not drunk and not going home.</p>
<p>Sheng Zha Zi</p>
<p>The wind and dew look into the night, the morning sun drives away the dark night, how many people cherish the spring, indulge in the light of heaven. Leisurely searching for old travel traces, the scenery is all like paintings, the willows are swaying, everywhere are those who forget words.</p>
<p>Eyes of Charm</p>
<p>The old paulownia trees in autumn are dotted with crows, the cold moon soaks the yellow flowers; Unable to sleep late at night, lingering in the east, how can I bear the beauty of spring! Difficult to hate the gray hair, helpless is the sad flute; In a few days of spring breeze, Jiangnan will be green again, green to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>Partridge Sky Using Jiaxuan Rhyme</p>
<p>One layer of clear waves, one layer of sorrow, but teach to miss the tenderness after parting, the brocade scales are hidden and there is no news, pointing to the south and north of the sky. The golden drums are vibrating, when will they rest, the longing is entrusted to the highest building, the flat boat also wants to find the fragrant traces, the water is far and the mountains are long and not free.</p>
<h3>Peacock</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shuqi</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 185</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>As soon as the order was issued, the leaders of each group gradually withdrew, leaving only one or two workers in charge of temporary "突" dispatch, and there was still a bit of planning, suddenly seeing the door open, a duty officer came in suddenly, reporting "A guest is asking to see you," just saying the name, only to see Tsurumi, already hurrying into the room, his movements not as peaceful as usual, and his face pale;</p>
<p>"Very rude..." The sound of the word "见" carried a very strong Japanese intonation. This is the phenomenon when people are in a hurry - their minds are not on, and they temporarily make a foreign accent that is neither fish nor fowl - just saying these four words, seeing two particularly eye-catching figures in the seat, he immediately swallowed the words he was about to say. Mr. W was so alert, observing his words and expressions, he already knew that Tsurumi was so hurried, there must be a change in the situation, and he also knew why Tsurumi swallowed his words, and immediately sent out those two comrades of his subordinates, nodding and smiling at Tsurumi and several of us:</p>
<p>"Let me introduce you..."</p>
<p>The two who were sitting on the side, seemingly guests, stood up immediately; the four of us, including Tsurumi, also took two steps forward. Mr. W used his hand to invite a shorter one, and said to us:</p>
<p>"Our Bureau's Chief Director - Mr. Dai!"</p>
<p>This surprised us all. Mr. Dai's reputation can be said to be like thunder to our group of people. His actions have always been like a dragon, unpredictable; at this time, he was clearly standing in front of us with a smile, but I couldn't quite believe it.</p>
<p>"This is Mr. Dai's English secretary, Mr. Ma." Mr. W introduced another taller guest.</p>
<p>We all shook hands and greeted each other, and Mr. W also explained our names.</p>
<p>"Let's skip the formalities, Mr. Gu seems to have something to discuss, please proceed as usual."</p>
<p>Mr. Dai rarely said three sentences in one breath in ordinary situations other than meetings and reports, Mr. W told me this later in a casual conversation.</p>
<p>Although he doesn't like social interactions, he never utters a word even at certain meeting occasions, but if you pay attention, he is always conveying his thoughts. When necessary, his gleaming eyes will also "speak", a wave of his hand, a tilt of his head, even complete silence, are a kind of silent language.</p>
<p>I have seen many, many silent people, that is just a cold calmness, or an acquired cleverness; they give people the impression of only a kind of dullness, making people feel unusually unapproachable, these people, judged harshly, can only be said to be lonely, or speaking mutes.</p>
<p>Mr. Dai is not like that; although he doesn't talk much, you never feel that he is calm among the crowd; on the contrary, he is very lively; because the tools that represent him to express or convey his thoughts are not words, but multifaceted hints. Even though he doesn't make a sound, he has already answered your question. Whether he approves of your opinion or does not accept it, he only needs to glance at you with his eyes, or look at you meaningfully, and you can understand, which is clearer than a long explanation. Sometimes he spits out a word, or a short sentence composed of two or three words, which can pinpoint the key points that you need to say but cannot say clearly, like opening a door to see the mountain.</p>
<p>Freedom Talk</p>
<h3>A Young Man's Ambition</h3>
<p>— Mei Bai</p>
<p>There is a play in Beijing opera called "A Young Man's Ambition", which is actually another name for "Bidding Farewell to His Wife to Join the Army". Xue Pinggui and Confucius's highly accomplished disciple Yan Hui have very different interests. He is unwilling to live a poor life in the cold kiln, so he resolutely bids farewell to his young and beautiful wife and goes out to join the army, resulting in a triumphal return and a happy ending.</p>
<p>The ambitions of today's young people are indeed not small. Confucius at fifteen was determined to "learn", but the ambitions of today's young people are different from those of Confucius - having nothing to do with learning.</p>
<p>What are their "ambitions"? Don't you see that the students of Zhongzheng University beat up the principal Xiao, and Suzhou, which has always been famous for producing "literary ruffians", also has a large group of middle school students who stormed and destroyed the "Su Bao" hall?</p>
<p>Therefore, it is said that today's young people are determined to "fight"! This is also an example of the progress of the times.</p>
<h3>Remainder of the Remainder</h3>
<p>— Lei Ke</p>
<p>Since the victory, I have been a person who buys a lot of surplus canned food from the US military, for no other reason than for economy.</p>
<p>The name "surplus" is naturally not very pleasant, like wearing someone else's old shirt, or eating someone else's "leftover rice water". However, we are such a country that uses old goods, plays antiques, and talks about national essence, using other people's surplus probably doesn't increase shame.</p>
<p>Many years ago, someone reported that some people in Shanghai bought the leftover food from foreign ships and resold them as Western food. But this news does not prevent me from going to small restaurants, nor does it prevent other compatriots. We need such low prices. We need to live, like rats in garbage cans, and those big and small beggars who rummage through garbage.</p>
<p>Recent news says that the moldy and spoiled goods purchased by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) were stolen and sold publicly in the market when they were dumped into the sea. This remainder of surplus materials is said to be poisonous to eat, and of course it is dangerous. But until now, I have never stopped buying cheap canned food. I eat these canned foods almost every day like a lonely and greedy rat, and throw the leftovers in the corner, letting the cats and rats eat again. Until now, I have not been poisoned, nor have I seen a cat retch, as for the corpses of rats, I have not seen one.</p>
<p>We probably all have a disinfected stomach, just like being able to eat centipedes and spiders</p>
<p>In my memory, two people once gave me "surplus" things, one was a bottle of something like "malt extract" that had solidified like iron, and the other was two slices of Takahashi muffins with a layer of green flowers on top. I couldn't eat the former. The layer of green flowers on the latter scared me. As a result, one went into the hands of a recycler, and the other was dried in the sun on the windowsill for many days and taken back by the original sender. Even now, when I think about it, I regret not eating it, I don't blame those two well-intentioned people, because they were originally compatriots who ate the leftovers of others, how would they know that those two things were not also the remainder of the remainder?</p>
<h3>Hundred-Foot Building</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Former traitors often live, today's loyal supervisors live, happily moving into the tall building with good equipment, better than living in an apartment!</p>
<p>As long as you have talent, don't worry about work, how many people returned with victory, unemployed and without a place to live!</p>
<p>Note: It is seen in recent news in this newspaper that traitors in Shanghai will be given jobs and moved to the new six-story detention center.</p>
<p>Convicts after being pardoned</p>
<p>Pardoned from suffering hunger and cold, falling into love and greed, being unfree is still abominable, what's wrong with committing crimes again!</p>
<p>Sentencing is not allowed, but evil deeds are treated preferentially; Don't you see the foreign-style house is fully equipped, the traitor's heart is happy?</p>
<p>Note: In Shanghai dialect, going to prison is called "falling into it".</p>
<h3>Listening to Opera and Watching Opera</h3>
<p>— Song</p>
<p>People in the north say "listening to opera", people in the south say "watching opera". I think that only when sound and appearance are both excellent is it a good opera, why should the ears and eyes be partial to one or the other? The Beijing court faction emphasizes those who listen to opera, not going to the balcony seats, not going to the ground floor seats, but sitting against the large wall, listening quietly with their eyes closed, which is considered the best. The so-called "large wall" is the last row of the two corridors downstairs, the seats closest to the stage, they may only listen to a certain person, or only listen to a certain opera, or even only listen to a certain section of a certain opera; male roles such as "Hong Yangdong" from that day, "Zhaoguan" and "Catching and Releasing" of a round moon, "Fenhe Bay" and "Wujiapo" , "Visiting Mother" of Sitting in the Palace, "Kongcheng" of the City Gate; female roles such as Yu Tangchun, Sacrifice to the River, Sacrifice to the Pagoda, June Snow, etc., all choose the most exciting section, and leave without looking back after listening. On the same day and at the same venue, even if there are other good dramas, they must not listen.</p>
<p>The second best is to sit in the small pool in the upper and lower stages, the third official in the upper and lower stages upstairs. These positions are often contracted by someone, or reserved by the theater for powerful people. The large restaurants in Shandong Pavilion, such as a certain hall and a certain residence, can also make reservations. If you rely on the big wall, then you don't need to set up this shelf here, you can sit as soon as you arrive, coming the latest and leaving the earliest, all those who sit in the front balcony seats and other balcony seats on both sides are old-fashioned. Only the middle room in the front balcony is reserved for the censors of the Metropolitan Procuratorate and the Censor of the Southern City Patrol in the Five Cities, either to invite guests or for their own use. On the morning of that day, if the discipline is not assigned, it can also be sold, which is not like the front row in the Beijing and Tianjin downstairs in recent days, which must have police seats. Beijing officials and their children who are old in Beijing, known as opera fans, must listen and use them personally, and they are not infected with the urban opera listening habits, and they are the most numerous in the back rows of the pool seats. I am very fond of opera, and I must sit in the front pool seat in the middle, arriving at the theater the latest and arriving at the seat the best. In fact, there is no other trick, but I am not stingy with tips for the seat master (that is, the usher in Shanghai theaters). Friends are surprised and think it is strange, and those who imitate what I do cannot get the same results as I do. Dong Xianjun served as the vice-censor and censor for a long time, and the theater also gave special preferential treatment. There are inside stories everywhere in society, even such a small matter as watching a play is like this, it is worthy of叹.</p>
<h3>New Analects</h3>
<p>— Yuan Qin Sun</p>
<p>The Master said: Do not look at anything without profit, do not listen to anything without profit, do not say anything without profit, do not do anything without profit. (In today's world, only profit is sought).</p>
<p>The Master said: To let go of profit and not act will cause much resentment. (High interest rates, lending at a discount, and some borrowers do not repay the principal and interest, how can one not resent?)</p>
<p>The Master's leisure living is stretched and shrunk. (In the era of housing shortage, one can only shrink in the pigeon cage.)</p>
<p>Zigong said: If there is gold here, seek a good merchant to sell it. The Master said, "Sell it, sell it! I am waiting for someone to buy it." (Zhonghang only collected 480,000 gold, those who hide gold cannot sell it at a good price.)</p>
<p>The Master said: The party exists, not yielding to the teacher. (In the university strike wave, the principal was also beaten, and the students also had party opinions.)</p>
<p>Once Zengzi had no illness, he summoned his disciples and said: "Disable my feet, disable my hands, the Book of Songs says 'Be cautious and apprehensive, as if facing a deep abyss, as if treading on thin ice', and now and hereafter, I know I am exempt from labor." (A certain villager cut off his feet to avoid military service, which is also pitiful.)</p>
<h3>Churchill and the Carp</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiang</p>
<p>After the fall of France, in this defeated country, a meaningful fable was whispered among the hopeful people. The "heroic" humor of this fable proves that the French people deeply believed in the stubborn people across the English Channel and their final liberation. The fable said:</p>
<p>In July 1940, when Britain was fighting alone, Hitler invited Churchill to Paris for a secret meeting. After Churchill arrived in Paris by plane, he was escorted to Fontainbleau, where Hitler and Mussolini were waiting for him around a tea table, which was placed right next to the famous carp pond.</p>
<p>Hitler wasted no time: "This is where I want to talk to you, Churchill! Britain is finished. Sign this treaty, admit that Britain has been defeated, and the whole of Europe can have peace tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I can't sign." Churchill replied quietly: "I don't agree that we have been defeated."</p>
<p>"Ridiculous!" Hitler roared, slapping the table, "Look at the obvious facts!"</p>
<p>Churchill sipped his tea. "In England," he said, "we often resolve disagreements with bets. Would you like to bet with me? The loser has to agree; he has been defeated."</p>
<p>"How to bet?" Hitler asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Do you see those big carp in the pond? Well, let's bet: whoever is the first to catch a carp without any normal fishing gear is the victor of the war."</p>
<p>"Bet!" Hitler yelled, he quickly pulled out a volley pistol and continued shooting at the nearest carp. The pistol was empty, but the water deflected the bullets, and the carp continued swimming undisturbed.</p>
<p>"It's your turn, Old Mo!" Hitler roared, "They all say you're a great swimmer! You jump down!"</p>
<p>Mussolini took off his clothes and jumped into the pond, but as soon as he grabbed the carp, the carp slipped out of his grasp. Finally, exhausted, he climbed up noisily with empty hands.</p>
<p>"It's your turn, Churchill!" Hitler said with gritted teeth, "Let's see how you do it!"</p>
<p>Churchill calmly dipped his teaspoon into the pond, scooped up a teaspoon of pond water, and then threw it over his shoulder. He repeated this continuously.</p>
<p>Hitler stared with his mouth open, "What are you doing on the ground?" he asked impatiently</p>
<p>"This will take a long time." Churchill looked at the water and replied, "But we are on the way to victory!"</p>
<h3>The Worries of Selling Writing</h3>
<p>— Lu Siqi</p>
<p>Selling writing was originally a painful task, especially today. Since last year, prices have been rising like a whirlwind, but the only income for writers, the manuscript fees, remain stagnant! Therefore, I often say to my wife, "If only prices could be as stable as manuscript fees, you wouldn't have to worry about making ends meet!"</p>
<p>A few days ago, the poet Zang Kejia wrote a rallying article about the issue of increasing manuscript fees. The editor also chimed in with a few words, saying that it should be increased by 20%.</p>
<p>In fact, an increase of 20% is not much. Take manuscript paper as an example, two or three weeks ago, a ream of forty sheets of paper that cost a little over a thousand dollars has now risen to over five thousand. Other things that writers cannot live without, such as ink, cigarettes, pens… all are increasing in price, and the increases are quite fierce.</p>
<p>If we look at it in proportion to the price increases, a 20% increase in manuscript fees is indeed a fair request. But even such a fair request, who knows when it can be realized.</p>
<p>High prices and low manuscript fees are certainly the misfortunes of writers, but currently, the biggest misfortune for writers is not just the manuscript fee problem alone, but rather the shrinking newspaper space, magazine closures, and bookstores refusing to accept manuscripts…. If the publishing industry continues like this, even if manuscript fees increase, our misfortune will still not be resolved.</p>
<p>I am a writer, and I hope to increase manuscript fees, and the higher the better. However, if the outlets for our writing become narrower and narrower, even to the point of completely cutting off the outlets, and we cannot even get the lowest manuscript fees, then that is the greatest misfortune for writers.</p>
<h3>Another Hero – A Record of the Righteous Act of Bravery by Dickson</h3>
<p>— Ding Ankang</p>
<p>I remember after the "Miss Luzon" plane crash, newspapers competed to publish photos of the affectionate dancer Li Sulan, because of her rescue of fellow injured dancer Luo Jun, unfortunately she herself tragically drowned, her story was both heroic and poignant. Recently, a friend, Mr. Sheng Shuhang, also a passenger on the plane, returned to Shanghai after escaping from Manila. According to him, after the plane crashed, there were cries for help in the cabin. Fortunately, among the passengers was an American sailor named Dickson, who, seeing the situation, jumped into the water and displayed his spirit of universal love, regardless of nationality or gender. First, he helped everyone onto the rubber lifeboats. A total of twenty people, including Dickson, were rescued. Then he connected the three boats with ropes. However, because people were not skilled at inflating, there was not enough air, and the boats almost sank. Dickson then held the rope in one hand and swam back and forth between the three boats, inflating them one by one. Only then did the three boats turn from danger to safety. From the time they boarded the boats at 3 p.m. until they were rescued the next day at noon, some people on the boats were extremely anxious, and some were sobbing uncontrollably. In addition to rowing, Dickson lowered his head and prayed for others. His righteousness and enthusiasm were inspiring. When everyone escaped danger and landed, some offered him money, but he refused to accept it, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. Therefore, I supplement this record to inform the world.</p>
<h3>Discussing Not Using Allusions – New Words on Couplets, Part Three</h3>
<p>— Tingsong</p>
<p>A couplet that integrates idioms is, of course, superior. Using allusions is secondary. If it is based on a specific matter and must use common words, but can still be elegant and generous, it can also be called a master in this field. There is a certain bureau in Beiping, with an extremely lucrative position. The director, a certain person, was quite fond of doing good deeds. In a certain winter, it was extremely cold, and those freezing and starving were visible everywhere on the roads. In addition to generously assisting various warm food centers, the director also independently opened a porridge distribution center, donating 300,000 yuan. The more than 3,000 employees in the bureau also donated as much as they could, raising another 300,000 yuan. Among the twenty-odd centers in the city, this center, with its abundant funds and diligent staff, was considered the most successful.</p>
<p>That year was the director's fiftieth birthday, and his birthday was on December 27th. The employees in the bureau jointly wished him a couplet. The wording was very elaborate, but a certain chief secretary was very frugal and insisted on using the words "porridge distribution", saying that the director prided himself on this as a heroic deed and should not be written vaguely, and that his birthday at the end of the year should also be relevant. There was a scholar in the bureau who was also a respected elder from the south. He created a couplet that said: "Distributing porridge saves ten thousand people, this is benevolence and longevity; celebrating the year three days early, first obtaining the spring of energy." This couplet used common words and was accurate to the three days before New Year's Eve, and was truly a work that could be appreciated by both the refined and the vulgar. The tone was also very grand, and it was widely circulated as a famous couplet. This matter was told to me by the late Zhao Jianqiu. Jianqiu also said that the director was not very familiar with writing, but liked to embarrass people with difficult questions. If common words were not used, he would consider it not good. One of his relatives, a certain lady, had many children and grandchildren. She passed away at the age of sixty-nine at the end of the year, just one day before the beginning of spring. It was proposed to give a mourning couplet, and it was indicated that he did not want to use allusions. The elder also created a couplet that said: "Tomorrow is the new spring, why does Heaven begrudge an ancient rare age; the elevated age set an example, all praise the person of great fortune." Although this couplet is not as elegant and generous as the previous one, Jian Lao said that the subject matter was already old-fashioned, and it had to be a straightforward description, without using allusions, and it was surprisingly able to express the meaning in plain language. There was also no trace of artificiality, and the matching of "Heaven's heart" and "public opinion" was extremely meticulous. It can be said to be very rare. Jian Lao regarded the elder as a lonely person in the world and expressed deep sympathy, so he refused to reveal his name.</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of the Newspaper Industry</h3>
<p>— Ma Jin</p>
<p>Some time ago, the national newspaper industry, burdened by the sharp increase in telegram costs, made repeated appeals and pleas, begging the government to consider the plight of the newspaper industry for the sake of culture and to formulate a special preferential measure for news telegrams. In fact, these appeals did not produce satisfactory results. Who knew that not long after, the government would issue a decree restricting the import of paper, which is tantamount to giving the already precarious newspaper industry another dose of tiger-wolf medicine.</p>
<p>The result of the sharp increase in telegram costs and the restriction on paper imports is that, in order to cope with the crisis, newspaper offices with a more stable foundation have been forced to adopt unfortunate measures such as reducing space, raising newspaper fees, and massive layoffs; while newspaper offices that were already struggling to survive have simply closed down; as a result, newspaper sales have decreased, and a group of outstanding individuals have become unemployed.</p>
<p>If China still needs culture, then the new and nascent newspaper industry should only be helped and not destroyed; if China still needs education, then newspapers are the most convenient way of social education and mass education; if the government still remembers public opinion, newspapers are reliable and the most representative public opinion organs; if the government still plans to implement constitutionalism, then the democratic tasks undertaken by newspapers cannot but be promoted.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Shanghai Newspaper Association has already sent representatives to petition the authorities. I hope they are tough!</p>
