<p>答，國軍已於十九日晨十時進入延安，今後局面仍繁於中共之方針，中共向來不顧人民之痛苦，堅持武力政策，政府之態度，將視中共是否欲對國家對政府叛亂到底而決定。前週其他各綫情形大略如下：</p>
<p>（一）在東北共軍再度攻德惠·農安，於三月九日渡松花江南犯，國軍於十二日開始反攻，戰鬥在農安方面較德惠方而爲烈，共軍在農安附近及其南部損失共達二萬餘，十六日共軍開始潰退，現松花江南已吿肅淸。</p>
<p>（二）山束方面無重要變化。</p>
<p>問，台灣目前之情况如何，政府着手改革該地行政之計劃如何？</p>
<p>答，台灣已完全平靖，行政改革計劃，白部長已於蒞台之日，即秉承中央意旨，明白宣示。</p>
<p>美元法幣匯率不變採新幣制尚非其時</p>
<p>問，謠傳即將改訂美元與法幣之匯率，以法幣八千元對美金一元，是否屬實，政府是否擬將台灣及東北流通券與中國內地之幣制改爲劃一？</p>
<p>答，改訂匯率謠言完全不確，劃一幣制，將來必可實現。</p>
<p>問，京滬各報盛傳三中全會有改取金本位新幣制之提案，此種報道是否屬實，政府是否計劃採取謠傳已久之新幣制？</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕記者昨爲外傳新幣制事，訪問財政當局，據答：此僅爲三中全會關於經濟問題之某提案中之一種擬議，但經交付經濟審委會審查時，僉認爲茲事體大，目前絕非共時，必俟預算有平衡可能，物價業已穩定，方可考慮。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕最近滬上謠言甚多，據悉：政府對於黃金及外匯問題，牌價未必有所改動，惟對於黃金利用一層，聞中央正在考慮適當辦法，或使黃金可以申請機器及必需原料進口貨法購外匯，或在政府出售敵僞產業時，可以容其購買工廠。另一說謂：現時政府正在考慮舉辦黃金公債或黃金存款，並延聘工商界人士，組織基金監察委員會，以爲公債或存款之監督機關。對私人存放國外之外匯，政府將頒訂一辦法，用以訂購機器及國內必需原料物品之輸入。至於金融界所主張復興金融公司之組織，全會已在研討中。</p>

<h3>黃河水道復舊　平漢路汴新綫開始拆除薛篤弼返京謁主席報告</h3>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕，水利委會委員長薛篤弼，十九日抵京，即日謁主席報吿視察花園口合龍工程。本報記者特請就此項工程經過發表談話，據談：黃河自廿七年六月在花園口潰決後，迄今已九載，本會於上年二月設立黃河堵口復堤工程局，於三月二十開工，承聯總，行總，交通，財政及軍事當周與地方政府之義讓協助，動員三萬餘工人，在黃沙，烈日，寒風，冰雪之下，不分晝夜艱苦奮鬥，於本年三月十五日上午四時幸吿合龍。此次全賴羣策羣力，與友邦人士之協助，在進行期中，雖備受波折，今幸能底於成。惟雖已合龍，僅爲初步，此後仍須進行之工作，一爲口門閉氣與加强，一爲下游復堤工程及整理汛區之工作，閉氣工程約需時二月，五月初旬可成，整理工作則將與農林部地政署方面會商決定方策辦理。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>延安的光復</h3>
<p>延安已於昨日光復了，這一消息的傳來，眞使我們威角多端；萬言千語，不知道從何說起。本來，延安爲陝北貧瘠之區，此一城市的命運，原無關整個民族的生命。可是自共黨以延安爲根據地以後，此一在延水河畔的丘陵城市，突然在中國乃至世界政局上顯出了它所處地位的重要。中國有無數相等於延安的城市，而延安之听以爲世人屬目者，實因爲它是中共的根據地。在過去十年來，儼然爲國內政治一中心，甚至有人稱之爲「赤都」。這一個稱謂之不能成立，稍有常識的人，類能道之。一國之都，原只有一個；豈能於一都之外，再有「赤都」？「赤都」，這無異承認延安之爲都。此在有常識的人是不願爲的。再講到延安的光復，有人也稱爲「收復」，這也有語病。延安原爲中國國土，旣不曾淪陷敵國，自夫從說是收復。它不曾淪陷，所以也不能說是收復。祗因近十年來延安爲共黨所踞，而共黨又蓋意謀叛，一切中央政令，均未能在延安執行；這是一種竊據局面。昨天國軍的入城，使延安得以重見天日，重見光明，這是光復，而不是收復，這是我們省先不能不指出的一點。</p>
<p>如今我們要談一談我們對於延安光復的觀戚，我們所不能不指出的就是延安的光復，還得憑籍於兵力，實在是一件不幸的事。可是，中國值長期抗戰之後，民生凋敝，社會不安，政府明知兵是兇事，原無用兵之意。在日本投降後的一年間，政府爲了蔪致中國的和平統一，不惜一再與中共協商，期於相見圓桌之間，一切問題能夠和平解決。因爲希望達成和平統一，政府曾一再相忍相讓。凡此種種，只要稍稍留意國事的人，率能道之。但是共產黨不是不明暸政府的苦心，因爲他們將黨的利益置在民族利益之前之所，所以政府不惜以忍讓而成立的協議，在他們卻視爲具女；而且又復變本加厲的得寸進尺，貪望無窮。在共黨，本來以協商爲兒戲，其目的原在統治整個中國；所以協議之墨藩未乾，便又花樣翻新，其欲摧毀我國戰後元氣未復之民族生命，昭然若揭。數月以來，共黨甚至否認國大所制定之憲法，否認國民政府及對外所簽訂之條件，是蓄意與國民爲敵，與政府爲敵，同時於國內各地全面進攻，破壞統一，政府被迫用兵，實在是一種不得已的舉措。</p>
<p>但我們終還覺得兵是兇事，最好不用兵。中國在經過了長期抗戰以後，瘡痍滿目，實在不堪再有兵戈之爭。所以當延安光復的捷報傳來之際，我們痛定思痛，覺得延安旣已光復，我們此後最好不再用兵。以武力來解決紛爭是最原始的方法；政府之不欲以武力來解決中國的共產黨問題，已如上述。祗因共產黨以爲它有武力可以憑藉，一再作亂，所以政府不得不以武力對付；此在正府，原非得已。如今延安旣下，我們至少應該有一個表示，就是以後不再用兵。我們應該再給共產黨一個機會，使它能够顧全到民族的利益，放棄它的武力，來謀中國的和平統一和復興。可是依據過去二十餘年來，中國共產黨的一貫作風，無論中共有怎樣誠懇的表示，它裏面的另有鬼胎，又是衆所咸知的事；則應吾有這樣不再用兵的一筆，自然又不無問題。我們應該將我們的信任放置在政府肩上；政府有什麼決策，當然是經過再番考慮的。</p>
<p>我們於此要提高國人警覺的；就是延安雖下，而中國共產黨的問題，却依舊存在。延安的光復，並不是中共問題的解決。延安在過去已經成爲一個目標；旣成了目標之後，未必對於共黨的行動是有利的。如今延安光復，對於共產黨，因爲他們已不再有一個視綫所集的目標，或許正是他們原來戰略計劃的一部：他們隨處可以有「延安」。我們對於中共旣訴諸武力，勢非將他們的武力全部擊潰不可，使他們再不能以武力爲憑藉，和平的獲致是有代價的；不經過流血，軍閥的日本和納粹的德國又如何會乞降？所以在這個時侯，中共如不欲自絕於國人，應該自動地將武力交出來，以一個普通政黨地位，參加政府，共同實施憲政，我們相信政府定能寬大容忍，予以自新的。中國正向憲政之道遇進，我們不否認有政治鬥爭的存在。但以武和來作政爭的工具，那是不能見諒於國人的。</p>
<h3>進出口聯銷制度的重提</h3>
<p>進出口聯銷制度，曾經市商會兩度建議，未荷採納，頃又向三中全會及院部，作第三次建議。</p>
<p>藉出口外匯，以抵充進口外匯，在國家的外匯資金上，旣毫無損失，而以進口需要之故，不得不推動出口，復以出口發展之攻，足以彌補進口上殷切之需要。此等辦法，在資金匱乏，出口呆滯，與原料等進口未能獲得及時的與充分的匯款之時，似沒有加以漠視的理由。</p>
<p>然而中央對此，始終還沒有確切的表示。旣未明白贊成，亦未斷然駁斥。揣其用意，不外兩端：</p>
<p>一，對於外匯及進出口貿易，已定有辦法，或認爲無此必要　美匯率提高至一萬二千元·這對於出口的鼓勵，和進口的限制，確已採取切實的措施，而且對於出口貿易，正在極力推廣。除掉特設委員會以外，其於收買，押匯，貸款等項，復作多方面的扶助。至於惟口方面，則分別種類，實行禁止，限額，重稅等種種限制辦法，其於外匯之申請，審核，辦理尤為嚴格。就大體說來，其於獎勵出口，限制進口之方針，確與工商界意見，無大出入。所成爲問題的，就是以種種故障，一切出口貨之行銷，還不如理想之順利。而以外匯申請極度困難之故，有許多必要的洋貨，如生產工具，機器原料等，却已遭受到限制的影響，致垂危中之民族工業，無從復蘇，並加深其發展和經營上之困難。此次三中全會，對於這一點，也已鄭重提及，可知現行辦法，其效力顯然還嫌不够。</p>
<p>二，原則雖然可採，辦法上頗多問題，不得不愼之又慎　如果單爲慎重起見，那是十分合理的。茲事體大，又屬創舉，在工商界的意見，也謂見仁見智，不免有所偏重。政府統籌全局，自不得不兼籌並顧，熟權利害，以期事出萬全，毫無遺憾，不過第一步對於原則上，如果確認爲有可採之處，那麽，對於辦法，手續，這些技術上的問題不妨邀集有關方面，和進出口業，及專家，縝密商討，另製方案。卽或商討結果，發見流弊太多，或事實上確屬窒礙難行，無可補救。到那時，利弊昭然，得失共見，也自然可以間執人口，示人以大公了。</p>
<p>經濟問題，本極複雜，在這工商業十分不景氣之秋，其複雜性與嚴重性，允過於平時。我們不相信：可以用一個單純的辦法來，解決一切的問題。不過任何辦法，如果言之成理，持之有故，那就該加以虛心考慮，慎加取去。這次聯鎖辦法的建議，已經是第三次了，至少限度，也足以見工商界對此的重視。政府方面，完全採納也好，予以駁斥也好，至少限度，似乎也應該給他們一個明白的答覆。</p>

<h3>蘇聯要求德巨額賠款　馬歇爾嚴予拒絕　促蘇提供所獲德工業秘密</h3>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科十八日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾十八日在外長會議中拒絕蘇聯要求德國賠償一百億美元之議，並稱：「吾人決不能跟隨莫洛托夫自波茨坦再　回耶爾　」。蓋此言係指故總統羅斯福在耶爾達會議時，對於德賠款總數以二百億美元作爲討論之標準，及蘇聯可得一百億元之事，雖允加以考慮，但以後在一九四五年之波茨坦會議中，三强並未決定德賠款之總數。莫洛托夫復指「英美國國在德國取得之專利特許，各項發明，船舶，黃金及國外之德國資產等，已値一百億美元。」關於此點，馬歇爾斥爲全屬荒　。並稱，美國已向全世界公布在德所取得之科學及技術情報，故蘇聯亦應公佈此項情報。會議至此並無結果而散。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十九日廣播：今日四强外畏恢復對德和約之初步礎商時，美方要求蘇聯提供自據人獲得科學及工業秘密。上午十一時四國外次在航空俱衆部舉行會議，由英外次擔任主席，研究盟國代表參加德國賠償委會之技術問題，並討論對　和約之政治條款。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十九日電〕此間觀察家今日聲稱：四外長最初數次會議時，氣氛尚穩平靜，惟日來美國務卿馬歇爾及英外相貝文對蘇外長莫洛托夫連續衝突，足見平靜氣氛，已形淡薄。據外交觀察家意見，蘇聯對總國賠償問題，處境困難，如果德國依然分裂，則蘇聯將於德西部取得之賠償，爲數甚徵，或竟毫無所得。如果依照廣泛總解決辦法，使德國統一，則蘇聯欲取得德國大量產品，以充賠款之要求，勢必予以放棄，更須與西方國家共同補助德國開支不數之數。</p>
<h3>蘇外長莫洛托夫宣布　雅爾達又一密約　有關德戰後賠償事項</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕莫洛托夫昨在莫斯科外長會議中宣布雅爾達協定又一密的之內容，係有關德國賠償之事項，其中一項規定得以德國工業隨時之出品作爲賠償。英外交部發言人今夜證實確有此項密約之存在，美國迄尚未曾省表示證實。如經證實以後，對於莫斯科之討論必有重大影響，蓋蘇聯之農取工業出產作爲賠償，遭英美之堅決反對，此固討論德國經濟統一問題時最主要之障碍。</p>
<p>密約內容</p>
<p>據塔斯社宣布莫洛托夫所發表之密約內容如下：英美蘇三國政府領袖於克里米亞會議中，就德國實物賠償之問題成立協議如下：（一）德國應以實物賠償戰爭時德國對盟國所造成之損失，賠價物應先行付給負擔作戰主要責任之國，受最重損失之國及同謀勝利之國。（二）自德國提取之賠償物資，分下列三種形式：（甲）於德國投降或停止有組織的抵抗以後兩年以內，自德國國內或國外之德國資產，提取主要賠償物資（如配備，機械，船舶，車輛，國外投資，德境工業運輸業航運業及其他企業之股權等等）；（乙）於戰爭結束後在尙待規定之期限內，每年得以德國工業之出產品作爲賠償；（丙）德勞工之使用。（三）就前項原則成立提取賠償物之詳細計劃後，由蘇美英三國代表在莫斯科設盟國賠償委員會。（四）美蘇代表團就確定賠償總額，及向被德侵略各國分配事議定如下：莫斯科賠償委會在初步階段，應以蘇聯政府之下一建議，作爲討論基礎，即賠償總額依據前條甲乙兩款規定，應定爲二百億元，其中百分之五十應歸蘇聯。英國代表團則認在莫斯科賠償會議討論以前，不應提及賠償數字，前述美蘇代表團之建議，當交莫斯科賠償委會作爲提案予以審查。協定簽字人邱吉爾，羅斯福，史達林。</p>
<p>待決問題</p>
<p>莫洛托夫旣已發表雅爾達之密約，今後應決定之問題，乃爲該一准許以德國工業出品作爲賠償之密約，將視爲波茨坦協定之補充部份歟，抑將因波茨坦協定之產生而作廢。蓋波茨坦協定並未述及以德國工業之出品作爲賠償也。莫洛托夫認爲該兩協定應同時通用，良以波茨坦協定關於賠償一章之首句，即爲「根據克里米亞之決議」。波茨坦協定雖僅規定以工業配備之移除作爲賠償，但亦未嘗禁止以工業出品作爲賠償，僅曰賠償物之支付，應使德國本國保留適當之資源，俾得毋須外界援助即可生存。而德國進口物之支付，應爲德國經濟之首要責任。據權威方面稱，英國反對以工業出品供作賠償，係因提取工業出品將損及對主要進口物之支付，結果不啻使英國人民負担英佔領區之費用。按雅爾達之第一密約，乃關於蘇聯向日宣戰之密約，前已於一九四六年二月十一日公布。倫敦觀察家對此次第二密約之公佈，均感覺異常驚異，猶憶一九四六年三月四日，英外次麥克尼爾曾在下院答覆員，表除二月十一日公布之密約外，不知尙有其他密的存在，並曰若果有之常予以公布。</p>
<h3>衆院外交委會通過　美對外救濟經費　我國亦可能獲得接濟</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕美衆院外委會本日暫時通過一項議案，規定聯總結束工作時，得撥三萬萬五千萬元援濟歐洲國家，中國可能包括在內。該案可望於明日由外委會正式通過，其中並未特別指出何國可獲得接濟，然委員會對衆院之報吿，將指明代理國務卿交克遜所指定之若干國家，即希臘，奧地利，匈牙利，波蘭及義大利，中國亦有被列人之可能。該案對可能獲得接濟各國之需要，有嚴格規定，</p>
<p>援助希土案即提付討論</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十八日電〕衆院外交委員會主席伊頓今日要求立即討論援助希土法案。據悉，或將於明日開始，屆時出席陳述者右代理國務卿艾克遜，陸軍部長柏德遜及海軍部長福萊斯泰等。立法草案除將軍事援助限制於顧問性質外，授　政府監督援助用途，並規定美國報　及無綫電各界代表可自由報道，不受檢查。該案賦予總統之廣泛權力凡五：（一）以貸款，賒貨及補助金等方式給予財政上之援助；（二）派遣文官協助希臘與土耳其；（三）指定有限數目之軍人以「顧問資格」擔任工作；（四）供給物資，服務及情報；（五）訓練希土兩國人員？惟此項援助不得轉讓予另一政府。該案倘獲通過，復興財政公司將先付一億美元以利進行。政府在共和黨領袖積極支持下，擬儘本月底英國停止援助以前完成立法手續。</p>
<p>范康兩議員曾發生衝突</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕共和黨參議員范登堡主張在國務院答覆渠尙在草擬中之許多問題以前，參議院暫經討論杜魯門援助希土兩國之事。范氏因此與民主黨參議員康納利發生衝突。范登堡否認渠擬妨礙該法案之進行，幷稱：渠以爲參院於本週內當可開始在希臘之英軍撤退回國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十八日電〕英外交方面十八日晚透當稱：英國於三月卅一日後不致絕對撤盡在希人員，英國仍將繼續雜質軍事經濟，法律，及警察使團以協助希臘政府。</p>
<h3>法對德經濟計劃　反對提高德工業水凖　同意經濟統一但附有條件</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科十八日電〕法外長皮杜爾今日在外長會議中就德國未來之經濟發表意見，其所提之經濟建議，對於歐洲經濟可能造成基本上的改革。皮杜爾所述之意見以銅鐵及煤斤兩項佔主要部份，渠主張不再以德國勞蘭省之鐵，供給魯爾煉鋼，應將魯爾之煤供給法國，使法國製造鋼鐵，而令德國集中於輕工業。渠主張無限制增產魯爾區之煤斤，但德國本國煤斤消費量應予限制，餘者每月規定數量悉供輸出。德國之鋼鐵產量應予嚴格限制，其生產能力之限定，倘須予以特別研究。法國認爲德鋼鐵產量，決不可超過一年前盟管會所定年產五百八十萬噸之限額。關於經濟統一問題，皮杜爾謂在德國疆界未定以前，法國反對設立德國之中央行政機構，但法政府相信不妨依其於本年一月所提備忘錄之規定，實施經濟統一。其他三外長對於皮杜爾之建議，一時尙無反響，惟其限制德鋼鐵達量之議，則顯然與莫洛托夫昨日之建議相衝突。莫洛托夫昨宣布願提高德鋼鐵產量至每年一千二百萬與一千四百萬噸之間，英美對莫氏此一建議已表同意。</p>
<h3>杜魯門返華府</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十九日廣播：杜魯門鑒於國內外局勢之迅速發展，已於止其假期，準備今日飛返華盛頓。按自杜魯門總統離華府後，兩黨外交政策已發生變化，若任其惡化，勢將影響杜氏阻遏赤潮在希土蔓延之外交政策一致，其二爲說服參院一部份議員，蓋後者認爲杜魯門之對希土政策，乃條侵越聯合國極限也。</p>
<h3>法共黨對政府不信任傳賴瑪迪內閣將辭職　總理在密議後稱政府無危機</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十九日電〕法議會昨經徹夜辨論，共黨對政府之越南政策信任投票棄權。政府對越南政策案終以多數通過，惟據今晨消息，法總理賴瑪迪可能於今午前向總統歐禮和提出辭職。共產黨之棄權，乃由該黨領袖副總理陶來士下令所致，此純爲對政府不信任之表現，在此種情形之下，根據法國政治傳統，無異明白表示，總理必須提出辭職。多數觀察家相信，如賴瑪迪政府不辭職，歐禮和將邀請賴瑪迪謀組不容納共黨之新閣。共黨之拒絕贊同政府之越南政策，乃由於政府拒絕共黨之主張，與胡志明談判而起。</p>
<p>退出法國實際政治以後之　高樂將軍，一向保持沉默，今日突宣佈渠將在出席四月七日史特拉斯堡自德人手中解放之二週紀念會時，發表重要演說云。</p>

<h3>西班牙擬具計劃　改君主政制</h3>
<p>〔路透社馬德里十八日電〕親弗朗哥政府之消息靈通人士稱：由關員四人組成之小組會，已擬具宣布西班牙爲執政團所統治之君主國之計劃，將交西內閣賽查。執政團由弗朗哥任團長，此一步驟乃復辟之第一步行動。該案經內閣通過後，將交起軍委會草成正式之憲法，再交國會通過，衆後由公民票決。預料全部手續須數日始能完畢。</p>
<h3>「工作圖存」英相勗勉國人</h3>

<h3>美對歐亞政策不一致　議員將提質詢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕若干北和黨議員本日已開始發問，美國爲何將撥款協助近東以阻遏共產主義而扣住中國與朝鮮之間樣款項？據不頤被露姓名之參衆兩院外交委員會若干高級委員吿本社記者稱：「在國會討論杜魯門總統提議以四億美元援助希士兩國之時，當以此點爲主要問題。美國旣擬撤離中國，亦未阻止中國及朝鮮之共產主義，但爲何又覺非援助希士兩國不可？此爲當局應圓滿答覆者。」共和黨　議員華雷及其他議員均認爲中國之情况與希土兩國無異，而美國竟拒絕援助蔣主席，此事殊屬費解。據衆議員伏萊斯吿稱：　曾與各議員談及此事，大部份意見均認爲「如果美國有所作爲，則美國對國外之一切行動必須符合吾人今後所採取之政策。」在馬歇爾赴莫斯科出席會議，及杜魯門休假期際，國務院對於此項矛盾之處，顯然無以解釋。代理團務卿文克遜被問及此點時答稱：國務院亦已察知此項矛盾之存在，但目前想不出答覆耳。國務院中若干人士則滙爲並無予盾之處，蓋希臘之遊擊隊顯有外援，在中國則尙無明證。一般議員均認爲美國阻遏共產主議之政策如欲予以合理之施行，則中國應得美國之援助云。</p>
<p>聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕美，國會共和黨議員今日堅持先須廣泛檢討政府外交政策，以及對中國，翰鮮，伊朗，巴勒斯坦，匈牙利與法國之各項計劃，然後方許用美元在希臘與土耳其築起屏障，對抗共產主義。</p>
<h3>英海軍建設計劃　將致力於應付原子戰爭　巡艦「震旦」號將交我國</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕海軍部次官杜格台爾今日向下院提出海軍預算一九六·七〇〇·〇〇〇鎊時，並宣布巡洋艦「震旦」號，不久即可移交中國。此外巡洋艦數艘，小型母艦二艘，驅逐艦數艘及小型艦若干均已或即將移交各自治領，英國之盟邦及印度，其中有係贈與者，有係出售者，亦有借用者。渠又云：海軍飛機之產量在增加中，本年度僅有驅逐艦數艘下水，不擬有其他大規模之造艦工程，經費當用於研究方面，尤其是原子彈對於海軍戰術之效果。英國不能再望有世界最大的海軍，但希望能有配備最精良之海軍。</p>
<h3>讚揚麥帥所持主張　吉田茂發表見解　和約簽字後希望美軍不撤退</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕吉田首相今日向聯合社記者發表談話稱：正式和約簽訂後，美國如欲確保世界和平，則美軍必須無限期留駐日本。吉田預測對日和約可在年內訂立，其後渠寗願美國而不願聯合國機構保護日本。吉田並稱：「吾人亦在對共產黨作戰。北方且有一極危險之敵須愼防。美總統杜魯門最近演說，可認爲美國擬領導世界與共產主義作戰。余茲敢大膽聲明，世界大局混亂一日，美國必須繼續監護日本一日，此與美國及日本均屬有利，否則使日本民主化之一切工作，勢必全功盡棄。」</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕吉田首相今日發表聲明，讀美麥帥早日訂立封日和約及恢復日本對外貿易主張，據稱；「本月十七日麥帥向各國駐東京記者所發表之言論，對於日本前途，關係甚大。舉世皆知麥帥忠實執行佔領政策，此次言論足見其充分認識日本現狀並完金了解日本人民。余敢向麥帥對日本之同情，表示深切敬慕之忱。日本全國人民亦有同感。」</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓十八日電〕國務院發言人頃向本社記者談稱：麥帥對於各項日本問題所持見解，國務院完全贊同。</p>

<h3>廿餘被告罪嫌不足　勸工大樓血案偵查終結　一律不訴處分　陳施君亦無預謀打人之企圖梁仁達部份俟緝獲兇手再辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕哄動一時，且為社會人士關懷之「勸工大樓血案」，茲經地檢處偵查終結，檢察官本司法獨立之精神，以毋枉毋縱之態度，公允裁量，認為被吿曹振坤，沈俠峯，王玉祥，王福根，蔡裕田，陳恂貫，社學三，劉宗德，徐偉成，李瑞椿，李拔雄，李　康，楊俊，沈世魁，孟智盛，曾永全，朱勇，奧佩坤，董啓鼎，姜來順，楊曉初，陳施君等二十三人（內梁仁達已死，故不列入），雖警察局目為犯有妨害秩序，或敎唆傷害等罪嫌，但經偵訊結果，毫無佐證，殊難成立，故予不起訴處分。劉用之檢察官之不起訴處分書中，將該案分二部份說明：</p>
<p>（一）關於曹振坤等二十一名被訴控吿妨害秩序部分。曹振坤·沈俠峯等二十一名均屬上海新新，先施，永安，中國國貨，中紡或其他紗廠等處職員機工，同時亦多為百貨業職業工會會員，於民國卅六年二月九日上午九時，分別參加三區百貨業工會全體理監事所負實召集之「愛用國貨抵制美貨籌備會主持之「演講會」。當尙未正式開會之際，即在南京東路中華勸工大樓三樓會址內發生糾紛事件，經市警局認為被吿曹振坤等二十一名，不無互毆成傷，在塲助勢情事，涉有刑法第一百五十條前段妨書秩序罪嫌，移送到處偵查。</p>
<p>本處按妨害秩序，係指妨礙或擾害國家所維持之安謐狀態，而刑法第一百五十條犯罪之構成，應具備公然聚衆及實施强暴脅迫兩種要件，缺一</p>
<p>不能成立。卷查「愛用國貨抵制美貨會」之籌備，係三區百貨工會理監事陳施君·丁盛雅·韓成武·劉才章·摩步雲·呂培裕·朱維仁·凌元　·陸恒孚等九人所共同負責，在籌備期間係採連帶責任，分担工作，並未推選何人綜理會務。二月九日召集百貨職工在勸工大樓三樓開會，聘請名流羅隆基·馬叙倫·馬寅初·郭沬若·鄧初民諸名流</p>
<p>到會演講，（該會是否呈准當地主管黨政機關或備案，係屬行政問題，）究其組織之意義，係響應上海市參議會發動之愛用國貨運動，意欲號召各業職工及廠商參加，共策進行，而當日被邀到會之名流，僅有郭沫若·鄧初民二人，餘皆因事不到，開始演講前，其內容主張如何，誰能</p>
<p>妄敢臆斷，是其無妨害秩序之意思，與強暴脅迫之行為，灼然可見。嗣演講會尙未開始，外面突來百餘人，會塲遂開始混打，被吿中王玉祥等十六人均當塲橫遭打傷，被吿等對於實施强暴脅迫以及互打各節，固矢口弗承，而此等被吿旣係均被打傷之人，且迄無佐證以確定被吿等之參與互毆或打人情事，即被吿等自己究被何人加害，亦屬不能指出，僅謂有工人裝束之人百餘，自外</p>
<p>奪門闖進，見人就打而已。其後黃浦，老閘兩警察分局據報遲至三四十分鐘始能趕到解救，只見被吿等受傷或乘亂逃走，將其拘局，其打手一無所獲。查本處傳訊警局人員，據供：無法證明本件下手毆打確為何等人氏，被吿等之所以被拿，因其分逃或有受傷，要不過一種援救時</p>
<p>緊急處分，經參照社會，警察兩局之調查報吿，談話記錄，訊問筆錄等等，被吿等旣爲被打受傷之被害人，又查無帮唆，共同，或公然聚衆，實施强暴脅迫或有其他助勢首謀行為之罪證，可資參證、衡情審酌，顯難問以</p>
<p>任何罪名，依刑事訴訟法第二百三十一條第十款處分不起訴，以求情法之平。</p>
<p>（二）關於孟智盛·陳嗣鴻·王玉祥訴陳施君（三區百貨業工會理事長）敎唆傷害罪嫌部分，吿訴人以無辜被打，陳係開會召集人，難辭其咎。查當塲混打情形以及陳施君尙未入塲即被哄迫出走，旣為事實，縱使開會通知為該會所發，初無</p>
<p>預謀打人之企圖，更無事據之證明，吿訴人之被混打成傷，自非陳施君所應負之刑責，吿訴人指摘殊非有理，爰依刑事訟訴法二百卅一條第十款不起訴處分。</p>
<p>至於梁仁達（永安公司職員）當日出席開會，被人打傷，傷重致死部份，應至兇手緝獲另行依法懲辦。</p>

<h3>謀刺汪逆不成陳三才殉難案　白俄密告人判刑十五年</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前北極公司總經理陳三才，抗戰期間在滬祖任地下工作，因計劃謀刺汪逆兆銘，事機不密，被白俄陶决出賣，被捕後在京罹難。勝利後該白俄經當局捕獲，清華同學會等迭請予以嚴懲。茲悉：陶次已於本月十五日由高院判處徒刑十五年，按陳三才氏隸屬軍統局，當時與該白俄陶次等密謀行刺汪逆，因拒絕陶次需索鉅額款項，遂被出賣報吿偽方。陳氏寓所在大西路美麗園，當時所謂「歹土」區域內。二十九年七月中，陶次引領偽方人員將陳捕去，解送南京。汪逆初尙不擬加害，而以外交部上海辦事處處長及交通部次長等偽職利誘，但陳不為所動。後汪逆再度遇剌，遂遷怒於陳，於該年十月二日綁赴雨花台槍決。當陳被捕之時，其表經湯恢宇亦一併被綁，旋即獲釋。渠在獄中時聞　此事全係白俄陶决所暗害，故出獄後曾報請工部局將陶次一度拘捕監禁於靜安寺捕房，旋因受七十六號之壓力而釋放，但曾秘密為陶次攝下一影作證。勝利後據情呈報戴笠將軍，不料陶次於抗戰後期又轉變担任忠義救國軍工作，故最初未予法辦。後經被害人親友力請　寃，始於去年一　將陶次及其弟拘捕最近淸華同學會及聯靑會復呈請當局迅予判罪，本月十五日晨經高院以通謀敵國罪處有期徒刑十五年，其弟則宣吿無罪。</p>

<h3>從世運談到全運（下）</h3>
<p>— 王微君</p>
<p>今年舉行全運，至少有下列兩重大意義：（一）明年八月在英倫舉行的世運會、是此次聯合國勝利後的第一次，有深長之意義，不但是恢復戰前國際性的體育活動，而且關係着國際間聯繫合作邦交的作有，我國已因此次勝利踵列四强之林，國際地位已大為增高，一切不能落後，體育亦然，自應挑選各項運動選手代表參加，而將所派往出席的代表，人數是多多益善，倘若限於人才的缺乏，所派往的代表人數，亦不應少於上屆參加世運的代表人數，（我國參加上屆世運代表總數為，一二〇人），至少應該不少於上屆的人數。至於成績的好壞，得分與否，都可不必計較的。我們可以藉派代表參加明年世運的大好機會，觀摩借鏡，以作他山之助。我們要產生參加世運的代表，亦惟有舉行整個性質的全國運動會一次，籍此挑選優良選手人才作為代表，再予以一個時期的各種技能的訓練與修養。</p>
<p>（二）我國因受八年抗戰的影響，全國運動會停開多年，今獲得全面勝利已近兩載，不但國際地位已日見增高，而全國亦因勝利得到更鞏固的累壞，（自然除了違背良心的少數叛國的人外）更進而努力於今後的復興建國工作，而體育事業關係建國的前途和整個民族的健康至鉅，自應速謀恢復全國運動會，以示倡導普遍地注重體育的風氣。最重要者，爲了顯示勝利後全國各地底統一和平與團結的象徵，表現於體育活動之中，更有舉行全運會的必要。至於舉行這次全國運動會的地點問題，筆者認為就勝利與團結的意義方面來說，自以在首都舉行為最適宜；倘若顧全事實為了稍减經費方面的困難，利用曾經用過的塲地稍事修葺補建，以節省開支，再注意交通招待最便利的問題等等，則上海亦為適宜於舉行這次全國運動的地點。更可有收獲的，上海觀衆必多，藉此增加收入彌補支絀，較其他各地尤有把握。</p>
<p>綜上兩點，雖屬個人的管見，我相信全國體育界都有同樣的感覺，一致願望本年的全國運動會能夠舉行，並且在最短期內，從速做起各項準備的工作。我們希望政府當局能顧及上述兩點重大的意義，設法排除經費方面的困難，於最短期內實現之。（完）</p>

<h3>證交運用所謂「臨時措施」今又徵收賣方特證　照成交價徵一成且須繳現金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所決定自今日後市起，對各經紀人所做遞延交割賣方之交易，亦依照成交價銀，徵收特別證據金百分之十，且槪徵現金。據證交某發言人談稱：該所前會增收邊交貿方特別證據金一成，蓋以不久以前，證券行市　漲所致。近來行市巳漸趨平穩，故再增收賣方特別證據金一成，以示公允。惟此係應付證券行市作不規則漲落時之臨時措施，一俟行市趨勢正常，即將取消云。該所開做遞交，本有週二週五兩種。前者以交易淸淡，已自上週六起，宣告停做，故現在只做週五　交一種。至鉅額交易，仍按預定計劃進行，並未中輟，現正待號置電話，一旦工竟，即可開做。鉅額交易證券，決定先開拍永紗，信和，新光，華豐擠瓷四種。交易單位，除華豐搪瓷為十萬股外，其餘均為五萬股。經營鉅額交易之經紀人，目前暫定仍以在證交交易最多之前卅九家經紀人為限云。</p>
<h3>華股交易寥落</h3>
<p>華股昨起仆雖不甚巨，但以消息雜沓，變幻多端，乍起乍落，今日午後起，增收賣方特證一成，買戶　動後，終吿潰散，反以低價結束。晨開　平疲，交易廖落，難以振作。開後暹永紗由二二四號七六號一三三號二號一二一號三二號一八八號一〇四號紛售而降為二六三〇元。七六號一二號一四號二一八號一一二號趁低維持而漸回升。迨四號八九號一七一號六八號一八〇號一九八號一四九號均進，始逐步扳高至二七七〇元左右。六一號四號一九七號二一八號一〇一號一一七號逢高脫手，近午曾回人二七〇〇元。一七七號一七一號一一二號有所維特，午收升至二七三〇元以上。結果較前收計永紗美亞華幾新光景福微降，信和中法勸興新華微升。遞交永紗信和微升，華豐新光微降，美亞跌半成弱。冷股榮豐有求少供，獨昂一成有零，麗安中紡各漲半成强，餘者升降俱見。</p>
<p>午後　祗做交易，夜報新幣消息又引起浮動，二一八號九九號均進，扳高至二八三〇元。榮豐由一〇四號一九八號掛高至漲停，永紗因一八五號九七號二二六號二二三號一七二號四號六一號咸售，回降至二七三號。一九八號出後即進，市塲通吿，二十日午後起，增收賣方特證一成。立起蠢動，漲到二八二〇元。二〇五號一五六號二二三號二二號一九八號脫手，降為二六四〇元。一五二號維持之下，稍有掙扎，無如大勢已去，二三一號一一二號一四號成售而降至二五九〇元。美亞迫停，新亞跌停，臨收稍盤，結果較前收計永紗信和華豐新光景福中法各跌半成，美亞跌一成，新華勤興微降。塲外各股大生平，餘者升降殊微。</p>
<h3>外股盤低</h3>
<p>外股昨略盤抵，怡紗自一八二五〇元起，逐步盤小至低價結束，洋商陸續吸收，紙業怡啤兩者頗見生色，結果較前收計紙業升半成，怡啤鋼業微升，業廣回小半成弱，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>統價交易平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨甚為平庸，起仆較窄。統丙晨開一〇五〇〇元，低價曾見九八〇〇元，始有補空活動，升為一〇八〇〇元，而以盤局結束。收後暗市喊高至一一八〇〇元。結果較前收計甲乙丁戊各低七百元，丙跌八百元，成交約五百餘萬元。</p>

<h3>美國亟需桐油售價距離尚遠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查：最近美國桐油之生產量，年僅一千萬磅，而美國之油漆工業，需要桐油允股，故極感短細。我國於一九四一年以前，桐油輸美數量，年達八千萬磅，戰後一度停頓，惟去年即吿恢復。單以一月至六月間，我國桐汕輸美之數量言，已達五千萬磅。目前唯一困難，即在雙方價格未能接近。據調查：去年十二月份美國之桐油價格，每磅約合美金三角九分半。最近價格，漸趨下游，每磅約合三角六分。而本市每磅價格，亦已合三角四分。如加上運費，保險費，關稅等，運美銷售，勢必虧蝕。現該處正擬調查本市實際可供外銷之桐油數量，同時調查美國與本市洞油之實在價格，以便覓求合理解決辦法。</p>
<h3>棉市去胃平淡</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開承隔日之餘威，價頗堅昂，嗣以幣制改革之請風平息，人心頓現軟化，新買頻有吐售。又聞近日粵漢等地價格仍有倒掛現象，致辦胃式微。迨至收盤時，各路吸胃不動，本街實銷亦平淡，故其結果，十二磅龍頭細布價做小至十五萬九千元，軋小三千五百元。藍鳳藍　五　陽　彩球等牌，亦均軋落自二千元至四五千元。惟漂布及斜紋府　，因　令關係，市獨搜俏，其餘色布及士林布，則仍鮮變化。</p>

<h3>支出悉依預算執行　國庫情形頗良好　改革幣制目前尚非其時</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕央行國庫局長夏晋熊氏昨日接見記者稱：目前國庫之支出，悉依預算執行，情形頗為良好。以收入部份而論，如國營事業出售及對外借款順利，則情况將大有改善。軍政機關公款存放辦法，自去年十一月份實施後，匯款幾已全部做到，存款則因各機關不乏與其他國行有長期往來者，未能全部提出，改存央行，須至提完之後，始能改存。目前一般經濟情况，自實施經濟新方案後，已收成效，惟自長期看來，尙需有其他揹施配合。以游費而言，尙無正當之出路，即使用之於生產，尙需三五個月之過程。今日之證券市塲，其中一部份證券，作用等於籌碼，不能解釋為投資。幣伽改為金本位，目前尙非其時，因改革之前提為財政上之收支平衡。第一次大戰後，英法之改革幣制，在一九二二及一九二五年，其間均有一準備時期。參加國際貨幣基金之國家，亦不必採用金本位，因今日國際間之支付，乃採取貿易之形式，而並不輸送黃金，至於四聯總處之存廢問題，頗值得研究，理論上此制度之存在，有利亦有弊，在央行實力不夠强化之際，四聯仍應保留。關於征用在美存款一節，夏氏認爲美國之政制與國情下，難成事實。又夏氏因財部電召，聞已於昨夜搭車晋京。</p>
<h3>二月份僑滙數額增五倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行二月份各地之僑匯數字，合計共達國幣八，二七五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。較之一月份之數字，超過五倍有奇；，即以匯率减低三倍計算，亦可見二月份之匯額超過一月份。至於各地之詳細數字，現尙在結算中。惟悉二月份以南洋之僑匯增加最為顯著，而菲律賓之有款匯來，亦自二月份始。</p>
<h3>茶市脚地鬆軟</h3>
<p>查各式內銷茶，除龍井·珠蘭·兩項花色，本街及無錫帮，微有去化外，餘均寂寞，故人心欲好無力，終吿平定。至於洋莊茶市，祁門紅茶，市勢續趨疲憊，蓋因一般調劑資金之貨主，依然吐出，故仍造成買戶　壓之機會，結果行情多再下游。他若外銷綠茶，交易尙可，惟過程則顯呈軟弱之態，照此情形，茶市脚地已頻露鬆象。</p>
<h3>絲綢喊價堅穩</h3>
<p>絲綢昨市頗形靜寂，喊價大致堅穩。人造絲一二〇號高山有光，上午六百四十五萬元開盤，迄午喊價五十萬元收盤。下午喊四十五萬元賣出，終日在四十五萬至五十萬元之間盤旋，無多大上落。產上西洋人絲如七五號半光及一〇〇號無光等，到貨甚多，均係簡十貨，每　二百磅凈絲，前者喊價一千一百萬元，後者價在八百二三十萬元之　。廠經喊價與前昨相仿，D字等級昨七百〇五萬元有成交。　貨稍見活躍，大誠格十璧　喊價一萬七千元，六千八百元有成交。人絲羽紗做價五千四百元，去胃頗好。</p>

<h3>王耀武將軍在山東的作風</h3>
<p>— 濟南十四日航訊　本報特派員麗天</p>
<p>是去年二月，原來在湖南擔任第四方面軍司令官的王耀武將軍奉會訓任第二綏靖區司令官，指揮山東戰事，由前中國陸軍總司令何應欽親自送他到濟南。當時的山東，除掉濟南，靑島，　縣，袞州，德縣，泰安等較大據點外，全省面積百分之八十五在共軍手中。王耀武到濟南時，除掉前第四方面軍司令部的幕僚以外，爲了那時正當國共和談高唱入雲之際，軍隊調動爲協定所不許，不僅他自己過去所謂練的部隊不能帶來，就是他在第四方面軍時代的警衛部隊特務團也不准入魯。</p>
<p>其時在濟南的只是舊裝備的十二軍和九十六軍的兩個師，在濰縣靑島的只是第八軍（新裝備）和九十六軍的一個師，另外還有少許旣無糧餉又乏械彈的地方團隊，其戰鬥力的脆弱，以致中共山東野戰軍區司令員兼新四軍軍長陳毅於三月一日奉延安之命來濟與王司令官洽商如何執行停戰令時，竟就開門見山，老實不客氣和王司令官說：</p>
<p>「你的部隊都是二三流部隊，戰鬥力完全不足恃。我們如要準備軍濟南，是隨時可以拿下來的。」</p>
<p>陳毅的態度相當傲慢。王司令官當時不假思索，並很明快地回答他：「誠然，我的部隊是也許是二三流部隊，但你要知道這二三流部隊經我王耀武訓練後，一個月內就已成爲第一流部隊了！」</p>
<p>山東局勢四個主要成因</p>
<p>整個山東，以演變到目前這種難以收拾的局勢，其主要原因，固由于：（一）共軍自七七戰起，即開始經營，迄勝利前夕，除交通綫及城市爲日僞控制外，全省整個的面，幾盡入其掌握，在這時共軍的兵力，即已擴充至近二十萬人。（二）勝利後中央派李延年將軍率十二軍九十六軍由皖北阜　　道入魯，因爲道途的遙遠，加以沿途須排除共軍的障碍，於三十四年雙十節始抵濟垣，在此以前，各地地方團隊游雜部隊羣爭接收，約略計之，雖也接收了百分之八十，但因指揮旣不統一，更談不上協同合作，共軍以其所處優越態勢，自有近水樓台先得月的便利。於是以各個擊破的手段，從接收者手中再接收，遂致從敵偽手中所接收的土地物資，除了濟青濰等少數城市外，又淪入了共軍的掌握。（三）李延年執行中央縮編政策過於嚴格，將原有八年來輾戰山東各地被共軍鯨吞蠶食下所遺留下的游擊隊及地方團隊縮編得一乾二凈相反地，年餘以來，山東共軍正規軍，則已由二十萬人擴編至四十三萬九千三百人，如將東北調魯部隊併計入內，當不下五十萬人。（四）尤爲重要的就是三十五年一月十三日，六月八日及十一月十一日的三次實際上只是國軍片面義務的停戰令，使國軍錯過了許多可貴的戰機，而成了一種坐着挨打的局勢。相反地，共軍　趁此將國軍各孤立據點，硬打軟吃，各個擊破，其中尤以得州，泰安，大汶品諸要點，即於去年六月八日第二次停戰令後十天以內被共軍攻佔的。假使該三要點始終在國軍手中，今天打通津浦綫，眞不知要減低多少不必要的犧牲和揭失。</p>
<h3>陳毅攻濟南不下自認「硬碰硬」王耀武一百天內打通了膠濟路</h3>
<p>王司令官耀武是在這樣一個熊勢之下來到濟南，這樣一個前題之下來處理山東局勢的。其任務的艱苦，担子的繁重，在國內卅八省中，誰又能找出第二個省份比此局勢更爲嚴重的呢？但五司令官對此並不呌苦，相反地，他默不出聲，率領着他的優越幕僚，首先就相織幹部訓練班，分期調訓各部隊團長以下中下級官長，每期十天，着重政治認識，從而提高士氣，已受訓的官長，回到部隊後，更轉而訓練部屬，政治訓練中，還有軍事訓練，從訓練中，王認識了各個部隊的主要官長，了解各部隊的能力，於是在部署時便擇其所長，予以適當的任務。訓練的效果很大，不到兩個月，原來士氣消沉的部隊都變成生龍活虎，戰　力至少此以前增加了五倍。五月底至六月中，陳毅發動十餘萬兵力圍攻濟南，滿以爲對此二三流部隊是可以手到巡拿，初不料圍攻廿餘日，除了損兵折將外，毫無所獲，陳毅這時也才認識了王耀武的厲害，認爲山東確已到了「硬碰硬」的局面，而一個以「不攻堅」爲作戰最高指導原則的共軍陳毅，此時自然也就知難而退了。</p>
<p>六月下旬，五十四軍在青島登陸，七十二軍由空中運來濟南。七月初起王司令官奉命開始作自衛性反缶。他憑原有的三個軍加上了這兩個軍共五個軍，予以最靈活，也是最巧妙的運用，使山東共軍如處五里霧中，正不知他有千軍萬馬，於是他展開了他的雄才大略，從孤立的濟靑　昌（業）四個據點中在一百天以內（雙十節前）打通了三九四公里的　濟全綫，織路局也隨着加緊擒修，於十二月十六日完成全綫通車的奇蹟。</p>
<p>戰績輝煌　明令兼主魯政</p>
<p>十月廿二日，正是王司令官督師濰縣，進軍掖縣的時候，行政院例會通過了他繼何思源兼任山東省主席。在事前，王司令官毫無所知。廿五日他由濰縣返回濟南，十一月一日正式舉行就職典禮。同月底，他赴京述職並請示，省府改組事宜，結果，改組後的魯省府王耀武並未引薦一個私人，民廳長劉翔原任國防部民事局長，爲陳總長介紹，財廳長爲財政部所推薦，敎建兩廳未動，即連秘書長一職亦以與他並無綠源的舊民應長劉道元調任。不僅如此，普通省主席上檯第一砲至少要把不被人注意而事實上最實惠的省金融機關如省銀行總經理之類位置私人，但王對此最起碼的一點亦未更易。在就職第一天，他所發表的施政三大目標，就是：（一）人才主義，（二）滅私奉公：（三）以「即知即行，任勞任怨，成已成物，有始有終」精神爲施政圭果。</p>
<p>作風明快　官兵一致簡樸</p>
<p>他原有司令部內各省人都有，相反地，山東人倒很少而以湖南人爲最多，這與何前主席注重同鄕派系所謂「曹家班」（何係曹州即荷澤縣人）「四中北大哥倫比亞」（何之學歷）的作風恰成爲一最强烈的對照。爲了王本人也是山東人，山東人總希望多用幾個本地人，於是有一次一位本地長者就為樣問他：「爲什麽湖南人用得這樣多？」王當時就笑着答覆他：「山東人只要行，我一樣用。」</p>
<p>王司令官不愛錢。不愛綫並不就是說不要錢，應該要的錢他照樣要向上面要，他說沒有錢不能辦事。但要來的錢每一個都要用在部下和事業上。普通一般部隊的積餘都是少數王官的當然專有品，但王耀武却把這筆錢作爲部隊或機關的公積金，用來辦子弟學校，遺族學校，遺族工廠，用來作爲過年過節部下的特賞費，貧病部下的補助費。</p>
<p>王司令官給人的印像是明快熟誠有禮，他個人的生活是簡單樸實嚴肅，他沒有一點嗜好，經常以散步和讀書來消磨他公餘的時間。他最恨貪汚，當他初到濟南時正是接收人員忙着「刦收」的時候，他却嚴令所屬，不准參與。他對於一切事情的處理着重實際，對於工作，尤最會支配時間，每天從早到晚，時時有事做，並且能把事情的緩急先後安排得很得要領。自從兼主省政以後，每日改爲上午治政，下午治軍，他喜歡發問，也喜歡學習，他的幕僚中就有很多專家學者，隨時</p>
<p>供他諮詢請敎，他的部下，受了他的感染和燻陶，都與王氏抱着同一作風，中低級不談，即就高級論：武的方面，由羅幸理，趙汝漢，吳鳶，，龍出雲，錢柏英至李昆治，文的方面由劉翔鄭希冉范奇浚至劉茂華，所給人的印像，亦一樣地是待入熱誠有禮，毫無官僚作風，生活簡單嚴肅，毫無頹　風氣，工作緊張踏實，毫無推拖習氣。這種作風日子久了，就很自然地蔚成一種風氣，這種風氣在記者十餘年來所接觸到半個中國的大小機關中尙爲見所未見。</p>
<p>三年政綱　奠定民主基礎</p>
<p>對於王耀武在山東的政續，由於軍事局勢尙未全盤開展，目下如談表現，似尙言之過早，但就今年元旦王氏所頒佈的山東省政府三年施政綱領來說，不僅奠定了山東在政治上的民主基礎，並且同時也奠定了山東在經濟上的民主基礎，劃領中第廿二條；「解決土地料紛，保護佃農，扶助自耕農，切實執行减租辦法，實現耕者有其田，」便是最有力例證。</p>
<p>配合着施政綱領，王耀武在本年元月八九日又召開了一個山東省綏靖區政務會議，所有黨政軍團縣級以上負責人均出席，會議中對於如何開展今後綏靖工作，如何與共黨在政治上競賽，已有一具體而詳盡的決定，爲着還沒有到可以發表時期，這裏不能詳爲介紹，但有一點値得一提的，就是在這次會議中，把過去按人口賦稅收入等將縣級單位分爲五級等的辦法廢除，而重行劃分爲下列五等，即（一）控制區域，（二）半控制區域，（三）據點區域，（四）機動區域，（五）淪陷區域。所有地方行政人員，除在省幹訓團受訓者外，一律不准如過去逗留在濟南附近安全區域，每到月底，等着來省府拿薪水，而必須至其工作崗位所在地，展開工作，這樣才能與軍事相配合。爲了執行和貫澈此項決議，兩個月來，就已有一位專員，四個縣長光榮殉職了。</p>
<h3>「山東人的牛馬喫了劃·擠了奶」</h3>
<p>上（二）月廿日起魯中大戰發生，因某一方面決策的錯誤，對共軍兵力估計失之過低，及部隊長過於輕敵，疏於戒備，種種因素的巧合，使共軍在魯中佔了若干小便宜，國軍爲了保全力量，除了確保濟靑濰三戰略要點外，對此膠濟綫大部份不得不作戰略撤退，而王司令官一年來所辛苦經營的膠濟綫廿四縣市只剩了八縣市，這個責任，實際上雖然不在王司令官，但王司令官還是把他記在自己帳上，相反地他對確保濟南的英明措軒，並不引以爲功！當魯中情勢緊張時，濟南實際上只是一個空城計，但陳毅鋻於王司令官聲威及過去教訓，其北西南三面大軍雖都已到了距濟垣不過廿公里左右，但必待淄博方面共軍將王司令官僅餘的一點本錢十二軍及九十六軍一部消化以後始敢作正而攻擊，也就在陳毅的過分愼重將事下，王司令官以制敵機先，果敢神速的姿態，（此時因已面臨最危急關頭，再也不能也無時間向上面請示了。）將淄博及張店一帶的軍隊，於廿四小時內全部撤至濟南外圍，如此旣保全了十二軍和九十六軍，同時又穩住了濟南，陳毅在淄博方撲了一個空，後始知道上當，但已不及，而只可眼巴巴看着躺在千佛山下的濟南城，聊以解嘲地說：『「硬碰硬」的局面又到了！』</p>
<p>津浦綫徐濟段雖可在很短期內全部打通，但對山東全局的沉淸似尙還有一個比較遙違的距雕。徐濟段打通了雖暫可使閉塞在濟南的人們透一下新鮮空氣，但由更全省大部份人民固仍尙在水深火熱之中，山東全局一日未沉淸，山東人民一日未獲眞正解放，王司令官是一日不得高眠安枕的。王司令官平時每晚只睡五小時，戰事緊張時只睡四小時，而此僅有的四小時中也時爲電話所干擾。他個人並沒有一點非分的享受，在有客人時是四菜一湯，沒有客人時只是一菜一湯，因此他自己講話時常說：「我到山東來，是替三千八百萬人民做牛馬的，不是來做官僚的。」山東老百姓在其精誠感召埋頭苦幹的作風下，也都異口同聲地說，「王耀武確是山東人的牛馬，牛馬終日操作，吃的是草，但擠出來的是奶。」</p>

<p>記者卡車過了長春外圍，直抵米沙十，該地是接通長春的一個有力據點，此次共軍足跡亦曾一度路過。米沙子車站和米沙子車站四周所有建築物，畫被共軍焚毀。據當地老百姓說，共軍僅留此一二日，便燒毀房屋四百間，拉走大豆十五火車。沿米沙子前行，一路火車軌道，盡被拆毀，電綫杆殆被截斷。自老家竄至希海間，七十華里許，鐵路和電綫，破壞殆盡。其破壞技術，實爲奇妙，將原來路基上的鐵軌，翻一個身，枕木便朝了上，倒在一旁，此外更有將枕木焚毀的，大小橋梁，全被炸毀，約七座。哈拉哈亦遭同樣的命運，大豆被拉走十五火車，房屋被焚五百餘間。</p>
<p>此次戰役，共軍佔據德惠周邊的各村莊，佈置砲兵陣地，意在使德惠變成焦土，發動所謂春季攻勢，但此一企圖業已幻成泡影。</p>

<h3>關於寫書評</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>近來和朋友們在一起，常常談到「怎樣寫書評」的問題。我們要求出版事業發達，就得要求有優秀的書評家給讀者寫好書評。文無定法，這是誰都知這的，寫書評又豈能例外？大抵一篇好書評必須做到克盡書評家任務的地步。因此評判一篇書評的好壞，就看那書評是不是能做到書評家應盡的任務。</p>
<p>有人說，一個文學家必須具有充分的表現思想的能力，一個科學家在他的著作裏一定要把他所研究約有系統的問題或結論很淸晰地整理出來，而書評家却不必有這種修養。這種看法實在是不正確的，文學批評人生，而文學書評家乃批評文學，一為直接的批許人生，一為間接的批評人生。文學書評家常將作品中作者的個性表達出來，與文學創作家將作品中人物的個性表現出來，並沒有兩樣。至於科學家的主要任務在提示眞理，供給正確的知識，而科學書評家乃在批評原作者所提示的眞理和所供給的知識，一為直接的提示眞理，供給知識，一為間接的提示眞理，供給知識。科學書評家常將原作者所提示的眞理所供給的知識作槪括的介紹，與科學家將自己研究所得的眞理和知識寫出來，也並沒有兩樣。眞正的文學書評，在另一方面亦可稱為一種文學創作。眞正的科學書評，在另一方面亦可稱為一種科學著述。文學書評最初用為研究文學的一種工具，後來却不僅限於作工具，竟成為文學作品的一種形式。科學書評最初用為研究科學的一種工具，後來却不僅限於作工具，竟成為發表科學知識的一種形式。</p>
<p>無論文學書評家或科學書評家，他自己應該是一個良好的讀者。要使自己成為一個良好的讀者，就得且備　讀的能度，明瞭內容及價值，求得結論。但又不能稍存偏見，應視批評為一種試騐的，客觀的，相對的結論，決不可以主觀的思想，强令讀者信服。要寫好的書評，必先澈底的了解原書的作者及其思想，認自己的研究和論述為一種不絕進步的過程。書評家應該堅守正確的評述能度，將自己對於某一書的意見提供出來，藉以激勵別人閱讀原書。</p>
<p>一副明徹的敏銳的鑑賞眼光，更是書評家所應且備的。特別是文學批評，必須充分地表現出藝術欣賞的能力。布魯克（Brook）說：「文學批評家應該把整個的心浸透在作者的心中，並且要眞正做到對作品確能欣賞的地步，決不能體察到作者的思想及其作品的眞髓。」現代文學批評中有　賞批評（RppreclativeCriticism）一種，即以竭力認識及玩味作品的性質功績價值為中心，不受倫理的，敎訓的限制，遠離實際利害關係的觀點。一個優秀的書評家於科學的方法，哲學的精神以外尙須經過一番藝術的修養。不用說文學作品要用鑑賞的態度去研讀，就是對於某種科學名著的發見，也須以鑑賞的態度出之。</p>
<p>美國作家馬岡（Leo　Markun）說：「寫書評的人應該用盡他的心力，包括他的風趣，記憶以及想像在內。」可見一篇好的書評必須寫得自然而明快，否則將使讀者感到沈悶枯澀。馬氏又力戒書評「公式化」，實在，我們常見的那些書評，眞枯燥無味極了，老是那一套形式和格調，引不起讀者的興趣。我想，任何一篇書評，如能出之以活潑流麗淸新簡潔的筆調，一定會誘發讀者的興味的。記着：好的書評本身就是一篇好文章，本身就有一種獨特的價值，書評家決不能忽略這一點。</p>

<p>乙　一般的檢討</p>
<p>（一）總類臺的圖書，數量旣少，而比較重大的親著，像百科全書或辭書等，在在民卅五內一册也沒有出版。</p>
<p>（二）哲理科學類中的倫理學項下，缺少關於兒童生活指導的著述。</p>
<p>（三）敎育科學類中對於大學敎授，中小學以及幼稚園或家庭敎師的師資參考書也沒有一册，要否做敎員是另一問題。當了敎師，做了世界强國的敎師，這種敎師應該有怎樣一個頭腦，怎樣一個良心，怎樣一張嘴，怎樣一雙手。這些問題，好像需要請老資格的老師寫些出來給我們懺悔懺悔。可是在八十七種敎育科學圖害中四分之一是球類比賽規則。</p>
<p>（四）本年內社會科學方面的著作數字，雖然比文學的少，但著述人材比文學衆幾多至一倍。關於理財學及公共財政學的著述，這一年內沒有精詳的著作，要是拿國情來講，似乎頗有需要。</p>
<p>（五）藝術方面的著述，關於雕刻，建築，印刷等專書，竟付闕如，就是音樂方面，也並無一册比較費工作的著作。</p>
<p>（六）自然科學方面著述，感到貧乏。天文方面缺少指導書，博物圖書一太也不出版。絕無僅有的一册植物學是譯本。物理化學方面有十五種，大都關於高初中用的，沒有一種是和國防有關係的。</p>
<p>（七）醫藥書籍在這種當口裏有廿六種出版，不算太少了。關於DDT的研究看不見。實業和小工藝書籍，祗等政治稍微上一點軌道，一定還能數量大增的。</p>
<p>（八）英文和俄文的比數相差很多，但由此可以　還國人的聽　了。</p>
<p>（六）文學類裏的圖書，缺少民間文學。我們經過這一次患難，南北東西的同胞，交流得像穿梭一樣。生活能安定一點的話，自有閒情來寫些出來給國人欣賞的。出版者每不註明書的體例，那是與營業有關係的。</p>
<p>巴金和茅唐二位是有創作能力的。但在民三十五年之內他們是否各有十種以上的作品，那是筆者不得而知了。上列一個統計內，他們各有道個數量，好像是發行人一再拿舊書當新書來哄大衆。</p>
<p>（十）史地學一類的圖書共有一八八種，在數量上，在百分比中不能算少了。年譜和中西偉人傳記都有貢獻。所缺者祗是考古學圖書。關於這次大戰的史料，有着相當的圖盡出版，可惜的獨多抄人家的，而對自身的如何抗戰，如何向西移動，如何勝利，反而沒有專書。</p>
<p>丙　出版物的比率</p>
<p>現在再談一談出版者的成就。以上一四六一種岡書，是由八十餘家書店出版的。其中最上軌道的發行者，要算商務和正中，商務的新書佔總數中百分之十一强，名列第一。</p>
<p>最後將各科圖書百分比數列表於后，作爲結束：</p>
<p>總類圖書　二八種　2％</p>
<p>哲理科學　九二種　6％</p>
<p>敎育　八七咱　5％</p>
<p>社會　三四三種　23％</p>
<p>藝術　三八種　3％</p>
<p>自然科學　六四種　4％</p>
<p>應用科學　一四六種　10％</p>
<p>語文學　五五種　4％</p>
<p>文學　四二二種　29％</p>
<p>史地　一八八種　14％</p>
<h3>美國外交政策論</h3>
<p>— 新俊</p>
<p>李普曙著　羅吟圃譯　大時代書局發行</p>
<p>在今日，中美的關係是如此密切，隨時隨地，都可以遇見美國的貨物和駐軍。但，關係雖是這麽密切着，而一般人對於美國的認識，那是太缺少了，或者可以說大半的中國人民都認不淸楚。這現象，身為中國人民，是極爲可恥的。</p>
<p>一個國家的外交政策，是它對外關係的方針，因此，要認識美國，必需先瞭解其外交政策。擺在我們面前的美國對華政策，當然尙無專書，而且也頗難看淸。對於其基本的正常的外交政策，在這本書裏，可以看到一個輪廓。</p>
<p>這一本書，主要是給美國人民看的書，被稱為美國外交政策的基礎讀物，李普曼在這本書中，很精心地，用嚴謹的筆調，指出了美國人民應該如何來建立一種「實力」與「責任」相均稱的外交政策。</p>
<p>作者的計劃，是美國人民所需要，亦更為我國人民所希期—美國有了優良正常的外交政策，對於我們是很有裨益的。</p>
<p>譯者說明，李普曼的主張是「在戰後由英，蘇，美，華（假如中國强大了的話），組織一個核心的同盟，而把其他的國家集結在這個同盟約週遭，形成一個普遍的國際新秩序。在這個秩序底下，各個弱小國家都享有安全自由，各國間免除引起衝突…」</p>
<p>這樣一個國際新秩序，非但中國希望，全世界的人民都等待着呵！</p>
<p>雖然，作者有許多地方尙有缺憾，譯者是把它指出了，所以，明白了它底缺憾，再讀這本書，其價值是仍然存在的。</p>
<p>作者自己說明：「我的主要的論旨是這樣，在十九世紀的大部分期間大體上很健全的美國外交政策，到了一九〇〇年以後，就危險地不健全了。……我的論點，一如讀者所見到的，成為對這一時期的美國外交政策底嚴酷的批評。……」</p>
<p>誠然的，作者是站於批評的立塲，來處理他的這本論著。</p>
<p>在這册論著中，作者先說明了本書的目的，次述到外交政策的基本原則。這二項，吿訴了讀者對於他的著書和外交政策的一個認識。</p>
<p>接着，它泛論：（一）美國的「國外責任」—美國的大陸邊界，西半球，太平洋，新舊世紀的轉換期；（二）美國外交關係的破產—狄奧多，羅斯福總統的外交政策，威爾遜的外交政策，美國外交政策的崩潰，羅斯福在戰前的地位；（三）幻景—「和平」，「裁軍」，「反對牽累的聯盟」，「集體安全」；（四）美國的地位；（五）大西洋集團勝利的國家，英美聯系，份子；（六）蘇聯與美國—過去，未來，利害，及太平洋上的二國間關係；（七）中國與美國—中美的聯系，東亞的不穩定；（八）普遍的國際秩序—核心同盟，及其理由，條件。</p>
<p>以上八項，作者均以其豐富的經騐而寫，讀後，對已往的美國外交政策，可瞭然其大概。</p>
<h3>遲開的薔薇</h3>
<p>— 忽然</p>
<p>斯托姆著·巴金譯·文化生活社版</p>
<p>巴金選譯了斯托姆（Theoder　Storm）所寫的三篇小說；以其中篇喚作「遲開的薔薇」為書名，列入他自己主編的文化生活叢書之一；此外一篇是「馬爾特和她的鐘」，以及中篇小說「蜂湖」；「蜂湖」在多年前曾被郭沫若譯述，呌作「茵夢湖」，這篇小說，就很受一般靑年讀者的歡迎。</p>
<p>斯托姆的作品，以前我沒有多讀過；可是在已經翻閱的幾篇中，他給人的印象就是淸麗和簡明；他不像英他的作家那樣，喜歡把塲面弄得緊張熟閙，或是多穿插小技節的插寫；單就情節而言也是夠平淡的；加之他的筆調舒緩，讀起來最覺輕鬆；可是也就為了這個原因；以致他的作品缺乏鼓舞生命的力量，斯托姆在「遲開的薔薇」內，所表現的就是這樣，有點像黃昏的夕陽，映射在憶念中的事物上，美雖美，然而畢竟是落輝了，一種遲暮的惆悵，一種恍悟，往往給憂　和易感的心，更添一段新愁。</p>
<p>他在「馬爾特和她的鐘」裏面，描寫一個老處女，孤單地居住在自己的小屋子裏，沒有人伴着她，除了一座「會講話」的鐘之外，就是一些古舊的家具，馬爾特在這裘度過悠長的歲月，她並未感受到寂寬和無聊，他和善忠實，愛護她所認識的親戚和房客；可是，直到一個聖誕節的晚上；她突然感到兩樣了；她在答的鐘聲裏，回憶到自已一生所經過的事物，她的哀愁；她小小的觀樂，一些美的東西驀然湧入那已經蒼老的頭腦裏，抬起頭來；她覺得：「四周差不多全黑了，外面祗有凄凉的月光，躺在積雪上面。除了鐘聲之外，家裏是死一般的靜寂。小屋子裏沒有孩子們的歌聲，廚房裏沒有煎烤的聲音，祗有她一個人留在家裹，別的都走了。」馬爾特這才茫然了。</p>
<p>「遲開的薔薇」中，叙述一個「陷落在事業網」裏的中年人，機械地度着日子，疏忽掉其他的東西；在不經意的時候：他年靑的的妻子，己在自已身旁漸漸萎謝了，雖然她依舊非常溫良和諧；直到有一天，他生日的那天，他忽然發覺他妻子送他的一件禮物，是幅少女的側影；也就是她自己年輕時的肖像；那驚人的嬌艷和珍貴的靑春，使道個粗魯的丈夫感到內疚；感到自己漢視妻子的殘酷；這時候他才懂得靑春是短促的，遲開的薔薇，原祗有瞬息的鮮艷；他彷彿覺得自己失掉了些什麽——因為愛情的懷底，賸下最後一點甘露了，已經夠遲的了。</p>
<p>這兩篇小說毫無曲折的情節，結構也簡單得很，組看起來，往往連主題也難捉摸似的；愛看故事的人，實在在這裏找不到故事，祗可於讀後的思沉裏，才能體會到作者所佈置的某種氣氛，含有着什麼眞義。</p>
<p>然而在「蜂湖」裏；我們可以看到較動人的畫面，描摹細賦，部局亦極淸晰；故事開始的時候，來因哈德已經很衰老了；有一天晚上，他在從前的戀人靑像前，重溫了一次年靑時的葡潔：他小時候，在家鄉和美麗的伊利沙白相愛着：之後，為了要求深造，就到城市裏去求學，二年中間，也曾回來一次，伊利沙白依舊是他唯一的伴侶；可是當他重新到城市後不久，也得到伊利沙白訂婚的消息，她已經依了母親的意思，答應埃利克的要求了，而埃利克却是來因哈德的好朋友，他為人忠實，也極富有，蜂湖一帶的宅子，就是他所主管的。幾年以後，來因哈德經過這片美好的國地，並且遇見埃利克，埃利克高興極了，立刻請他回家，殷動招待視為上賓；當然，他必定會遇到那位，使他永遠神往和感傷的情人的——依利沙白與從前毫無改變，一樣的輕盈柔美，可惜她的心却已黯澹無光了；在重逢幾天中，他們也曾有過歡愉的担聚；他們同在春天的傍晚合唱着民歌，即湖濱淺綠的芳草中，也曾留下了漫步的踪跡；雖然現在沒有兒時嬸戲中，所能尋覓得到的楊梅，雖然依利沙白已成為別人的妻子，雖然來因哈德再也寫不出一句詩了；那縱情的暢聚舉竟是芬芳的；他們也算度過了一個短促的春天——在節季尙未變換以前，來因哈德不得不離開了美麗的蜂湖，回到自己孤獨的歸途上去。</p>
<p>像斯托姆所寫的這一類作品，是很難為一般讀者所接受的；巴金在「後記」就提起過：「我不想把牠介紹廣大的讀者，不過對一些勞瘁的心靈，道清麗的文筆，簡樸的結構，純眞的感情，也許可以帶來少許安慰。」事實上，也確是如此，現在我們把這本小書介紹在讀者限前，也自有其用意的；創作的取材，原不允許我們滯留在狹小的囚籠內，憑着離奇的幻想與花巧的詞藻，取悅於一般有閑階級的讀者羣，可是，我們却不能一筆抹殺流露眞情的作品，認為牠無聊膚淺而不足道；這個世界儘管荒謬，究竟還是「人」的世界，我們需要一切充滿「人情味」的東西，我們的情感更需要多方面的溉灌與滋長；雄壯的合唱或是交響曲，可以帶來滂礴汹湧的情潮，可以使人在昏迷的時候，感受到一次大的激蕩；然而，一支小夜曲，幾聲低微的獨唱，却自有一種雋永的價值，往往令人低徊無限，沉思反覆。</p>
<p>生命需要火的鍛鍊；靈魂需要火的洗禮；但斯托姆這種近似散文的小說，正如一彎小小的溪水，在你脚下　流而過，你會聽到了麽？</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>上海市民的習慣，喜歡走後門，，前門的門可以說是門雖設而常關。或問：「何故也？」我說：「所謂」與其媚於吳，寧媚於　」是也。此時此地想找一個行不由徑的君子人，的確是一件難事。</p>
<p>從走後門——屈原所謂的「捷徑窘步」一點看來，可以推想到更大的政治方面。</p>
<p>試稽歷史上之變亂多　自宦客外戚，有自來矣。</p>
<p>論語載季康子問政於孔老二：</p>
<p>「如殺無道，以就有道，何如？」問題問得很暢快。如果是張獻忠一定直截了當地說：「殺！殺！殺！」</p>
<p>可是口口聲聲講大學諭中庸的孔老二却板着敎師爺的面孔說：「子為幾，焉用殺？子欲善，而民善矣。君子之德風，小人之德草；草上之風，必便。」</p>
<p>這論調似乎不失爲進步，好像說社會的風氣繫於政治制度。</p>
<p>然而，孔老二走到了封神榜下，也不禁合南唸道：「老二要開殺戒了」。於是，上任不到幾天，就殺掉了他的政敵少正卯。老二之德，未嘗如草上之風焉。</p>
<p>自然，衛道諸公會解釋為「替天行道」。</p>
<p>一面小小的杏贊旗，能遮蓋盡宋公明「仁義」的鬼險麽？</p>
<p>恐怕是英國維多利亞女皇的故事，如果記憶沒有錯誤的話。鈕這樣靑訴我。</p>
<p>英明的女皇，因爲勤於政治，滐夜才回到她的臥房。她的丈夫某親王，巳經睡了，而且臥房的門也關閉了。</p>
<p>敲門的聲音——</p>
<p>「誰？」親王睡在床上問。</p>
<p>「女皇陛下！」女皇在門外回答。</p>
<p>「親王壓煩地翻了一個身，再開始他的睡眠。等了半　，女皇又在敲門—</p>
<p>「你是誰呀？」</p>
<p>「女皇陛下！」</p>
<p>彼此的聲音都放大了。</p>
<p>「我問你是誰？」厭煩充　於言表。</p>
<p>聰明的女皇，突然用她輕　的　予溫柔地說：</p>
<p>「我？你的妻子。」</p>
<p>接着，門很快地開了。親王擁抱着這一代的英主，有力地說：「這麼夜深的時候，我不願意為任何人開放臥室；如有，那僅只是我的妻子。」</p>
<p>我不禁聯想到三國演義中的故事：</p>
<p>好像是劃玄德求見司馬徽的時候，向看門的小童子報了一大串官銜。可惜此小童子並無祿　的修養，他只是忠實，而且不介意地說：「先生！我記不淸那麽嚕蘇的一大串。」</p>
<p>只此一句話，看門的小童子就比這蓋世的梟雄高明。</p>
<p>一天到晚照鏡子，只知有己不知有人的王爺們，不要向苦難的人民，得意地背誦愈的高官厚祿吧。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>世界職業婦女節　記她們「三·一八」慶祝會</h3>
<p>— 黑星</p>
<p>這是一個華貴的集會，由於那個華麗·絢爛的燈光，與那些高貴底太太小姐們洒脫，貴族式底服裝，我嗅到了一種貴族婦女客廳裏應有的豪華，而又優美的氣息。</p>
<p>我幷不曾過份誇張，那個貴族式底夜會；她們，都受過很好的敎義，有着很好的社會地位，她們犬部份能說一口流利的英文，一身幷不能算太鮮艷而又極優美的裝飾；她們，包括了近十個國籍底婦女—那裏有英國的，美國的，德國的，俄國的，自然，大部份還是中國的，用着國際底語言，聲訴着和平，聲訴着維持中美友誼。</p>
<p>笑聲，充滿着整個禮堂。　　服裝的色澤與鬢髮的美好，在這一種純粹是高級女性表現自己的敎養與思想的國際集會的塲合裏。顯露出她們窈窕修美的身影。</p>
<p>她們把身心都浸潤在這一個一年一度的「世界職業婦女廿週年紀念會」甜蜜歡愉的氛圍裏。一部份人準備了歌唱舞蹈，一部份人準備了她的長篇演講詞。</p>
<p>這些，都是要經過長時期的敎養，才能夠顯露出自己的才華的。</p>
<p>我以一個記者的身份，坐在她們坐位的後面，這些個包括各種不同國籍底婦女，在那些一輕裘濃裝之外，都是極雍容富貴的。</p>

<h3>苦工的供詞</h3>
<p>— 楊思</p>
<p>高院更審赴日苦工處殺同伴一案，報載被吿及證人叙述當時受日人虐待的慘酷情形，正如被吿律師所說，是一幅活生生的圖書，道是電影的好材料，也是裁判日人罪行的好證據</p>
<p>被吿說他「被日方運至日本鹿兒島作苦工，帶領同伴廿三人，每人每日祗有吃飯七兩，其中且無米，大部為豆餅　葡等雜物。又因北海追酷寒，積雪達二尺許厚，同伴均宿於敗絮及柴草之內。同伴苦工在此饑寒交迫之下，死亡達十之五六。」</p>
<p>有一個證人說：「苦工在日，看見日人吃剩的魚骨和肉骨，都要搶着吃。彼此苦工，均不堪受日虐待，那有再自己人打自己人之理。」</p>
<p>單是上面這兩段話，看了已經夠使人心頭覺得沉重，在遙遠的北地這許多同胞在日人的皮鞭下坐着苦工，饑寒使他們陸續死亡，其慘酷有甚於戰地，他們默默地被拖去，默默地死亡，幸而活着的又一聲不饗地被送了回來，他們不會控訴，終將帶着這份意外的苦難而長眠地下，做一個無知無識的中國人，當此亂世，其苦難也不爲人所知，不爲人所識。</p>
<p>然而苦難並沒有使他們麻木，相反地，他們已經得到相當的警覺、如那個證人所說的話，就是一句有知識的話，而且廣泛地來看，也是一句事實。</p>
<p>可憐的是畢竟『同病不相憐』，且不管在日人壓迫之下到底被吿曾否殺害同胞，總之回來以後他被同伴控吿却是眞的了。這個事實，却也可以廣泛地來看，看了更足以使人心頭感到沉重。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「好好依你」！徐紹明用筷子在碗上敲了幾下。「我這就呌阿史去拿！你請坐下，咱們再談談」！。</p>
<p>老祝點點頭，依舊坐了下來，湊徐紹明在跟阿史說話的時候，又回頭去向蘭笑了一笑；蘭對他搖搖頭，神氣不大高興，似乎很不贊成他對老徐用這種手段。他當然不能立刻就告訴她這是哄着老徐玩的，祗能再對她笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「可是，老祝，你不能開我玩笑」徐胖子也未嘗沒有戒心。「今天晚上金愛麗不來，明兒我的支票退下來你別怪我」！</p>
<p>其實祝兆年早就胸有成竹。</p>
<p>「行！可是，你得注意」：他用手在桌子上敲了兩下。「今晚我祗能伴她來跟你談一下。什麽時候讓她住到你這兒來，還是你們自己決定的好」！</p>
<p>徐胖子大為高興，立刻又喝了一大口茅台；跟着阿史拿了一本交通銀行的支票簿進來，祝兆年一下搶在手裏，又掏出自己的筆，授給徐胖子，像逼債似的逼他簽了一張四十五萬元的支票。中間少不得還經過幾度討價還價以的爭執。</p>
<p>「好，好，拿去吧」！最後，胖子把支票授給了老祝，一面不勝遺憾地說：「你就是這一點不及老鍾！他跟我也是好朋友，可從不勸我化這類沒有名色的錢」！</p>
<p>「對，對，你這話一些不錯」！老祝藏起了支票，滿不在乎地說：一所以，老鍾也能開電影院，跟你一樣的做老板」。</p>
<p>「老鍾道幾年倒眞了幾個錢。哈哈哈！誰像你道個獃子」？徐紹明笑得眼睛瞇成一綫，同時急急端起酒杯來，喝了一大口。四五十萬塊錢對於他畢竟是件小事，支票一出手，心裏也就不再肉痛了。</p>
<p>現在，祝兆年的心思遷是非常的亂。捐款的事雖己圓滿解決，但劇團全體職員撤退的準備却至今還沒有着手，而他和蘭的突然在這個時候異地重逢，更給他增加了一個大問題；還有金愛麗的應該怎樣安置，也相當的使他感到棘手。（二十）</p>

<h3>National Army Recaptures Yan'an Yesterday Morning; Captures Over 10,000 Communist Soldiers; Remainder Flees in Disarray Towards Qingjian</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, Urgent Telegram, 4:00 PM, 19th] Since the Communist army in northern Shaanxi attempted to invade southward, the National Army has launched a fierce counterattack. On the afternoon of the 18th, they advanced to a location 10 kilometers from Yan'an. After a fierce battle, Yan'an was recaptured at 10:00 AM on the 19th, and the Pagoda Hill in the southeast suburbs of the county was also occupied. The battle results are currently under investigation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, Urgent Telegram, 5:00 PM, 19th] The large-scale offensive launched by the Communist army towards Xi'an to coincide with the Moscow Conference has now been completely crushed by the National Army. Yan'an, the old nest of the Chinese Communists, was recaptured by the National Army at 10:00 AM on the 19th. Since the Communist army entrenched in the areas of Yanchang and Kuangxian began their southward invasion on the 11th of this month, the National Army, in order to defend itself and thwart their conspiracy, launched a two-pronged counterattack. The fighting has been exceptionally fierce in recent days. The Communist army, under the overall command of He Long, included the most elite units of the CCP, such as the 1st Teaching Brigade, 2nd Teaching Brigade, 358th Brigade, 359th Brigade, 27th Division, 120th Division, 1st Police Brigade, 2nd Police Brigade, 3rd Police Brigade, 4th Police Brigade, 1st New Brigade, 4th New Brigade, 8th New Brigade, 9th New Brigade, 11th Brigade, and 6th Cavalry Division, totaling over 100,000 men. After a valiant attack by the National Army, they completely collapsed. According to preliminary statistics, the Communist army suffered approximately over 10,000 casualties, with over 2,000 surrendering. The National Army completely occupied Yan'an at 10:00 AM on the 19th, and is currently comforting and resettling refugees.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Xi'an, 19th] Elite units of the National Army entered Yan'an on the 19th, and are vigorously clearing obstacles within the city. National Army aircraft are constantly flying low over the roads outside Yan'an, disseminating over a dozen types of easy-to-understand proclamations urging surrender and reassuring the people. It is reported that the Communist army's organization has retreated to a certain village in the An'sheng area in the northwest. Xi'an was filled with the cries of newsboys selling extra editions at noon on the 19th, and the people's spirits were high.</p>

When the National Army completely occupied Yan'an at 10:00 AM and cleared the battlefield, they discovered over 4,000 Communist army corpses and captured over 10,000 Communist soldiers.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense stated that the first National Army unit to enter Yan'an was a certain division of Hu Zongnan's troops. They first broke into the Yan'an urban area from Jinpenwan, 30 kilometers southeast of Yan'an, yesterday morning. Subsequently, another division attacked from the north of Ganquan and also entered the city one after another. After merging with the first unit to enter the city, they began a mopping-up operation. After a period of street fighting, the Communist army was unable to resist and began to flee into the nearby mountainous areas. Currently, the National Army, with the exception of a portion left in Yan'an, is tracking and pursuing them. It is claimed that the National Army annihilated over 10,000 Communist army soldiers in this battle. The National Army is currently expanding the battle results.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that Mao Zedong was not in the city when the National Army occupied Yan'an.</p>
<h3>People in Beijing, Pingjin, Changchun, and Other Places Rejoice Upon Hearing the News; Newspapers Issue Extra Editions That Sell Out</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The National Army entered Yan'an, which had been occupied by the Chinese Communists for over ten years, at 10:00 AM on the 19th (note: this newspaper received the news and relayed it to the entire country through various radio stations in Shanghai at 6:00 PM last night). This battle report spread quickly after it arrived in the capital at 5:00 PM this afternoon. All sectors of society expressed their joy upon hearing the news. The Central Daily News and Peace Daily News both issued extra editions. A reporter interviewed a certain military observer, asking for his views on this. The observer said: "Yan'an is a stronghold that the Communist army has occupied for twelve years. The Communist army uses this as a basis for international propaganda. Now that their old nest has been lost, their international propaganda effectiveness will also be completely lost, and the Communist army's way out will become that of roaming bandits."</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 19th] After the news of the National Army's recapture of Yan'an reached Ping City, the Jishi News first issued an extra edition, which immediately sold out.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 19th] Upon learning that the National Army had recaptured Yan'an at 6:00 PM here on the 19th, the Central News Agency immediately distributed extra editions and broadcast the news to the citizens. All 620,000 residents of the city were overjoyed.</p>

<h3>Wang Hongshao Speaks: The Chinese Communists Should Be Aware</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 19th] Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, said that the National Army's rapid recapture of Yan'an proves that the Communist army does not have much strength. The Chinese Communists should realize that using military force to seize political power is not necessarily more advantageous than using political methods. Wang Hongshao judged that the CCP may be isolated into the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan border regions in the future, and its main force will tend towards Shanxi, but it may also cross the Ping-Sui Railway, passing through Chahar North and Jehol North, and fleeing to the Northeast.</p>
<h3>National Army in Zhangjiakou Moves West to Prevent Communist Army from Fleeing</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 19th] Passenger transport between Zhangjiakou and Datong on the Ping-Sui Railway will be temporarily suspended from the 20th.

(3) Tax collection procedures will be simplified as much as possible. At the same time, the tax collection mechanism will be adjusted and long-standing malpractices will be eliminated.

(5) The military reorganization plan will still be followed, with priority given to reorganization, reducing expenditure, and selling enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Plenary Session Reviews Military Affairs Yesterday; Chief of General Staff Chen Attends and Answers Questions; Today's Session Reviews Politics and Economics</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Third Plenary Session held its fourth plenary session at 9:30 AM on the 19th. 262 members attended. Zou Lu chaired the session. First, the secretariat reported on the minutes of the third session, and then began questioning Chen Cheng's military report. Those who raised questions included Cheng Zhonghang, Shu Haosen, Gu Zhengding, Ma Chaojun, Li Wenfan, and Li Zhongxiang. The questions focused on three points: (1) strengthening military service, (2) treatment of soldiers, and (3) morale. The above questions will be summarized and handled together within the Military Proposal Review Committee. The session recessed at 11:00 AM. After 25 minutes, Wang Jun continued with oral questioning, and Yao Dahai submitted written questions. Chen Cheng answered the questions raised by the members of the Central Committee one by one. Chief of General Staff Chen stated that the morale of the front lines was very good and there was no fundamental problem. From the previous battles in southern and central Shandong, it was learned that the Communist army had no political training or party will. The Communist Party often drove captured National Army soldiers and militia to act as vanguards. Most of the Communist soldiers did not understand the mission and goals of their operations. As for the treatment of National Army soldiers, it was the government's duty to improve it, but the National Army's mission was not only to eliminate the Communist army but also to provide relief to the people in the pacification zone, so this issue needed to be considered. The session adjourned at 12:10 PM.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng reported to the plenary session at 10:30 AM on the 19th, while answering questions on military issues, that he had received an air force inspection report from the front lines at 8:00 AM that morning, stating that the vanguard of the National Army had advanced to a location eight li from Yan'an. At that time, the participants also knew that Yan'an, the Communist Party's military and political center, would be captured soon, but they did not expect the National Army to advance so quickly. According to Chief of General Staff Chen's response to questions at the plenary session, after the Communist army launched its spring offensive, the National Army began its advance towards Yan'an on the 14th. The battles have been very fierce in recent days. It is reported that the Communist army on that line was under the command of He Long, gathering no less than 100,000 troops, attempting to capture Xi'an in one fell swoop, but after the National Army launched a counterattack on three routes, east, south, and west, they were unable to resist and retreated. It is reported that after the Communist army launched its spring offensive, it openly denied the National Government and engaged in military operations, causing the government to be forced to begin its advance towards Yan'an. The fourth plenary session today had a lively discussion of military issues. It is expected that the plenary session will have an important and solemn expression on this issue.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Third Plenary Session held its fifth plenary session at 9:00 AM on the 20th to continue the review of economics and politics. Dai Chuanxian will chair the session.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] Members of the Central Committee continued to report their attendance at the Third Plenary Session. Today, five executive committee members, Zai Kuisheng, Li Shuhua, Miao Peinan, Xue Dubi, and Zhang Jia'ao, one alternate executive committee member, Deng Longguang, and two central supervisory committee members, Lei Zhen and Zhang Fakui, reported, for a total of eight people. Including the previously reported members of the Central Committee, there are a total of 308 people.</p>
<p>[Another telegram] The Third Plenary Session's review committees on the afternoon of the 19th, the Party Affairs, Economic, Political, and Military groups, reviewed proposals separately. The Military Group, chaired by Lu Zhonglin, passed a draft resolution on the military report, which was submitted to the plenary session for discussion. The Economic Group, chaired by Chen Lifu, held a general discussion on the resolution of proposals. The Party Affairs Group, chaired by Zhang Daofan, discussed the reports of the various groups within the group. The Political Group was divided into a Political Reform Proposal Sorting Group and a General Proposal Sorting Group, which held separate meetings for review. The latter was convened by members Lu Dangping and Liu Keshu, and the former was convened by members Hu Ciwei and Li Zhongxiang. All review groups except the Military Group have completed their review, and the rest need to continue to meet for review.</p>

When the reporter asked about the Communist radio station accusing Du of boasting, Du smiled and said, "We show it with facts, so there is no need to boast. What about Lin Biao personally commanding the Communist army to take Changchun?" Du also said that in the Communist army's four invasions, claiming 200,000 troops, many Korean Communist cadres were discovered among those captured and killed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Andong, 19th] The Shenyang-Andong Railway will officially start direct express trains on the 20th. The entire journey is 522 Chinese li, arriving in the evening after departing in the morning. When the good news came, all sectors here cheered.</p>

<p>[This newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] Regarding the reception of Jinzhou and Dalian, the relevant departments here have suddenly taken a silent attitude and are unwilling to release information, but they are actively preparing and holding meetings to discuss it.</p>

<h3>Minister Peng Talks About the Government's Attitude: The Future Situation Is Still More Difficult Than the CCP's Policy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at the National Goods Building at 4:00 PM on the 19th. Minister Peng Xuepei answered the following questions:</p>
<p>Q: What is the military situation? What is the government's outlook? What is the situation around Yan'an and on other fronts?</p>
<p>A: The National Army entered Yan'an at 10:00 AM on the 19th. The future situation is still more complicated than the CCP's policy. The CCP has always disregarded the suffering of the people and insisted on a policy of force. The government's attitude will depend on whether the CCP wants to rebel against the country and the government to the end. The situation on the other fronts last week was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In the Northeast, the Communist army attacked Dehui and Nong'an again, crossing the Songhua River southward on March 9. The National Army began its counterattack on the 12th. The fighting was fiercer in the Nong'an area than in the Dehui area. The Communist army suffered more than 20,000 casualties in and around Nong'an. On the 16th, the Communist army began to collapse. The Songhua River south has now been cleared.</p>
<p>(2) There are no important changes in Shandong.</p>
<p>Q: What is the current situation in Taiwan? What are the government's plans to reform the administration of the region?</p>
<p>A: Taiwan has been completely pacified. Minister Bai has clearly stated the administrative reform plan on the day of his arrival in Taiwan, in accordance with the intentions of the central government.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate Between the US Dollar and Legal Tender Will Not Change; It Is Not Yet Time to Adopt a New Monetary System</p>
<p>Q: Is it true that there are rumors that the exchange rate between the US dollar and legal tender will be revised soon to 8,000 legal tender per US dollar? Does the government plan to unify the currency system of Taiwan and the Northeast with that of mainland China?</p>
<p>A: The rumors of revising the exchange rate are completely unfounded. Unifying the currency system will definitely be realized in the future.</p>
<p>Q: It is widely rumored in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai that the Third Plenary Session has a proposal to adopt a new monetary system based on the gold standard. Is this report true? Does the government plan to adopt the long-rumored new monetary system?</p>
<p>A: The government does not intend to adopt a new monetary system and has repeatedly denied this. As for changing to the gold standard, although some scholars advocate it, today is clearly not the time.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Regarding the rumors of a new monetary system, the reporter interviewed the financial authorities yesterday. According to the reply, this is only one of the proposals in the Third Plenary Session regarding economic issues, but when it was submitted to the Economic Review Committee for review, it was unanimously believed that the matter was too important and it was definitely not the time to implement it. It will only be considered when the budget can be balanced and prices have stabilized.</p>
<p>Production Loans Will Not Stop; The Use of Gold Is Being Considered</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The rumor in Shanghai newspapers that production loans have been suspended has now been proven to be untrue. According to reliable sources, the plenary session attaches great importance to loans. In the future, a system of fixed orders will be adopted, and factory fixed assets can be used as collateral. A new long-term lending financial institution is currently being planned, and the Central Bank has been designated to handle re-mortgages. As for absorbing floating capital, the method of raising deposit interest rates by national banks may be adopted to solve it.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] There have been many rumors in Shanghai recently. It is reported that the government may not change the official price of gold and foreign exchange, but the central government is considering appropriate measures for the use of gold, or allowing gold to be used to apply for foreign exchange for the import of machinery and essential raw materials, or allowing it to purchase factories when the government sells enemy and puppet industries. Another saying is that the government is currently considering issuing gold bonds or gold deposits, and is hiring people from industry and commerce to organize a fund supervisory committee to act as the supervisory body for bonds or deposits. The government will promulgate a method for private individuals to deposit foreign exchange abroad, which will be used to order machinery and import essential raw materials. As for the financial community's proposal to reorganize the financial company, the plenary session is studying it.</p>
<p>The Four Joint Offices Issued a Total of Over 700 Billion Yuan in Various Loans Last Year</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The authorities attach great importance to various loans to assist the development of industry, agriculture, and commerce.

<h3>Restoration of the Yellow River Channel; Dismantling of the Bianxin Line of the Pinghan Railway Begins; Xue Dubi Returns to Beijing to Report to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th] After the gap in the Huayuankou levee was closed, the Yellow River channel returned to its old course. The north and south ends of the Bianxin branch line of the Pinghan Railway, which originally passed through the old course, have already begun to be dismantled. The Zhongmou Bridge of the Longhai Railway, which is built over the new Yellow River, has also been abandoned and dismantled after a temporary road was built on the side of the bridge recently.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, arrived in Beijing on the 19th and immediately reported to the Chairman about the inspection of the Huayuankou closure project. This newspaper's reporter specially asked him to comment on the progress of this project. According to him: The Yellow River has been breached at Huayuankou since June of the 27th year (1938), which has been nine years. The commission established the Yellow River Closure and Embankment Restoration Engineering Bureau in February of last year and started work on March 20th. With the righteous assistance of the United Relief Association, the Executive Relief Administration, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, and the military authorities, as well as the local government, more than 30,000 workers were mobilized. Under the yellow sand, scorching sun, cold wind, and ice and snow, they struggled hard day and night and fortunately completed the closure at 4:00 AM on March 15th of this year. This time, it relied entirely on the collective wisdom and efforts and the assistance of friendly countries. Although there were many twists and turns during the process, it was fortunate to be able to succeed. However, although the closure has been completed, it is only a preliminary step. There is still work to be done in the future, one is to seal the gap and strengthen it, and the other is the downstream embankment restoration project and the work of reorganizing the flood area. The sealing project will take about two months and can be completed in early May. The reorganization work will be decided in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Land Administration Department.</p>
<h3>Egerton Actually Sent a Letter to Xue Dubi Protesting the Closure</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Huayuankou levee closure project was originally scheduled to be completed on the 15th, but Egerton, the head of the United Relief Association's office in China, sent a letter to Xue Dubi on the 14th, protesting that the closure work was accelerated without prior consultation. However, according to Xue Dubi's conversation with reporters today: This protest is actually a one-sided statement, because in the meeting with the Communist Party and the Executive Relief Administration on February 8th, although the Communist Party requested a postponement of the closure, I solemnly stated that it was impossible to stop work and could only notify in time. Mr. Egerton also expressed his agreement at that time. The protest now is obviously caused by the pressure from the Communist Party. Mr. Xue has replied to Mr. Egerton, with some corrections, detailing the course of the meeting. And after receiving a telegram from Director Huo of the Executive Relief Administration on March 8th inquiring about the situation of the closure, he telegraphed back that it could be completed within ten days from March 9th, and asked him to notify the Communist Party, so Mr. Xue has fulfilled his responsibility. In addition, the reply letter was delivered to Mr. Egerton in Shanghai on the 19th by Wu Youxin, an employee of the association.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Recovery of Yan'an</h3>
<p>Yan'an has been recovered yesterday. The arrival of this news truly makes us feel various emotions. With countless words, we don't know where to begin. Originally, Yan'an was a barren area in northern Shaanxi. The fate of this city was not originally related to the life of the entire nation. However, since the Communist Party established Yan'an as its base, this hilly city on the banks of the Yan River suddenly showed the importance of its position in the political situation of China and even the world. China has countless cities equal to Yan'an, but the reason why Yan'an attracts the attention of the world is because it is the base of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past ten years, it has儼然become a political center in the country, and some people even call it "Red Capital." The establishment of this title cannot be established, and people with a little common sense can say it. The capital of a country originally has only one; how can there be a "Red Capital" outside of a capital? "Red Capital" is tantamount to admitting that Yan'an is the capital. This is what people with common sense are unwilling to do. Speaking of the recovery of Yan'an, some people also call it "recapture," which is also a misnomer. Yan'an was originally Chinese territory, and since it has never fallen into enemy hands, how can one talk about recapture? It has never fallen, so it cannot be said to be recapture. It is only because Yan'an has been occupied by the Communist Party for nearly ten years, and the Communist Party has intentionally plotted a rebellion, and all central government orders have not been able to be implemented in Yan'an; this is a situation of usurpation. Yesterday, the entry of the National Army into the city allowed Yan'an to see the sun again and see the light again. This is recovery, not recapture. This is a point that we cannot but point out first.</p>
<p>Now we want to talk about our views on the recovery of Yan'an. What we cannot but point out is that the recovery of Yan'an still depends on military force, which is really an unfortunate thing. However, after China's long-term war of resistance, the people's livelihood is declining, and society is unstable. The government knows that soldiers are fierce, and originally had no intention of using troops. In the year after Japan's surrender, in order to achieve China's peaceful reunification, the government did not hesitate to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party again and again, hoping that all issues could be resolved peacefully at the round table. Because of the hope of achieving peaceful reunification, the government has been tolerant again and again. All of these, as long as people who pay a little attention to national affairs can say it. However, the Communist Party does not understand the government's good intentions, because they put the interests of the party before the interests of the nation, so the agreement established by the government at the cost of tolerance is regarded by them as a piece of paper; moreover, they have intensified their efforts to gain an inch and are endlessly greedy. For the Communist Party, consultation is originally a child's play, and its purpose is to rule the entire China; therefore, the ink of the agreement is not dry, and new tricks are renewed, and its desire to destroy the vitality of our nation after the war is undisguised. In recent months, the Communist Party has even denied the constitution formulated by the National Congress, denied the National Government and the conditions signed with foreign countries, and deliberately opposed the people and the government. At the same time, it has launched a full-scale offensive in various parts of the country and destroyed unity. The government is forced to use troops, which is really a last resort.</p>
<p>But we still feel that soldiers are fierce, and it is best not to use soldiers. After China has undergone a long-term war of resistance, it is full of scars and is really unbearable to have another war. Therefore, when the good news of the recovery of Yan'an came, we felt deeply that since Yan'an has been recovered, we should not use troops again in the future. Using force to resolve disputes is the most primitive method; the government's unwillingness to use force to resolve the Communist Party issue in China has been described above. It is only because the Communist Party believes that it has military force to rely on and has repeatedly caused chaos, so the government has to deal with it with force; this is not the case for the government. Now that Yan'an has fallen, we should at least have an indication that we will not use troops again in the future. We should give the Communist Party another chance so that it can take into account the interests of the nation, abandon its military force, and seek China's peaceful reunification and revival. However, according to the consistent style of the Chinese Communist Party in the past twenty years, no matter how sincere the Communist Party's expression is, there are other ghosts in it, which is also a well-known thing; then, we should have such a stroke of not using troops again, which is naturally not without problems. We should place our trust on the government's shoulders; the government's decisions are certainly made after repeated consideration.</p>
<p>What we want to raise here is the vigilance of the people of the country; that is, although Yan'an has fallen, the problem of the Chinese Communist Party still exists. The recovery of Yan'an is not the solution to the CCP problem. Yan'an has become a target in the past; after becoming a target, it may not be beneficial to the CCP's actions. Now that Yan'an has been recovered, for the Communist Party, because they no longer have a target for their sight, perhaps it is part of their original strategic plan: they can have "Yan'an" everywhere. Since we have resorted to force against the CCP, we must defeat all their military force so that they can no longer rely on military force. Peaceful attainment is costly; without bloodshed, how would the warlord Japan and Nazi Germany beg for surrender? Therefore, at this time, if the CCP does not want to isolate itself from the people of the country, it should automatically hand over its military force, participate in the government as an ordinary political party, and jointly implement constitutional government. We believe that the government will be able to be tolerant and give it a new life. China is advancing towards the path of constitutional government, and we do not deny the existence of political struggle. However, using military force as a tool for political struggle cannot be forgiven by the people of the country.</p>
<h3>The Re-mention of the Import and Export Joint Sales System</h3>
<p>The import and export joint sales system has been suggested twice by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, but it has not been adopted. Recently, it has made a third suggestion to the Third Plenary Session and the Yuan Department.</p>
<p>Using export foreign exchange to offset import foreign exchange, there is no loss in the national foreign exchange funds. Due to the need for imports, it is necessary to promote exports, and the attack of export development is enough to compensate for the urgent need for imports. Such measures, in the case of scarce funds, sluggish exports, and the failure to obtain timely and sufficient remittances for raw materials and other imports, seem to have no reason to ignore.</p>
<p>However, the central government has not yet made a definite statement on this. It has neither clearly approved it nor categorically refuted it. Its intention is nothing more than two points:</p>
<p>1. There are already established methods for foreign exchange and import and export trade, or it is considered unnecessary. The US exchange rate has increased to 12,000 yuan. This has taken concrete measures to encourage exports and restrict imports, and is making every effort to promote export trade. In addition to the special committee, it is also providing multi-faceted assistance in terms of collection, remittance, and loans. As for the oral side, it implements various restrictions such as prohibition, quota, and heavy tax according to the types. The application, review, and handling of foreign exchange are particularly strict. Generally speaking, its policy of encouraging exports and restricting imports is indeed not much different from the opinions of the industrial and commercial circles. The problem is that due to various obstacles, the sales of all export goods are not as smooth as ideal. Due to the extreme difficulty in applying for foreign exchange, many necessary foreign goods, such as production tools and machine raw materials, have been affected by restrictions, so that the ethnic industry in a critical condition has no way to recover, and its development and operation are deepened. The difficulty. This Third Plenary Session also mentioned this point solemnly, which shows that the effectiveness of the current measures is obviously not enough.</p>
<p>2. Although the principle can be adopted, there are many problems in the method, so we must be cautious and cautious. If it is only for the sake of caution, it is very reasonable. This matter is of great importance and is also an innovation. In the opinion of the industrial and commercial circles, it is said that everyone sees benevolence and wisdom, and it is inevitable that there will be some emphasis. The government plans the overall situation and has to take care of everything, familiar with the advantages and disadvantages, in order to ensure that everything is foolproof and there is no regret. However, if the principle is confirmed to be adoptable in the first step, then the methods and procedures of these technical problems may invite relevant parties, import and export industries, and experts to discuss and develop another plan. Even if the result of the discussion finds too many malpractices, or it is indeed difficult to implement in fact, and there is no remedy. At that time, the advantages and disadvantages are obvious, and the gains and losses are seen by all, and it is natural to be able to stop people's mouths and show people the public.</p>
<p>Economic problems are extremely complicated. In this autumn of industrial and commercial depression, their complexity and severity are more than usual. We do not believe that a simple method can be used to solve all problems. However, any method, if it makes sense and has a reason to hold it, should be considered with an open mind and carefully taken away. This proposal for a chain method has already been the third time, at least to see the importance of this to the industrial and commercial circles. It is okay for the government to adopt it completely, or to refute it. At least, it seems that they should be given a clear answer.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Demands Huge Reparations from Germany Marshall Strictly Refuses Urges the Soviet Union to Provide German Industrial Secrets</h3>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 18th] US Secretary of State Marshall refused the Soviet Union's proposal for Germany to pay 10 billion US dollars in reparations at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 18th, and said: "We can never follow Molotov from Potsdam back to Yalta." This statement refers to the fact that the late President Roosevelt, at the Yalta Conference, used 20 billion US dollars as the standard for discussion on the total amount of German reparations, and the Soviet Union could get 10 billion yuan. Although he agreed to consider it, the three powers did not decide on the total amount of German reparations at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. Molotov again pointed out that "the British and American countries have obtained patents, inventions, ships, gold, and German assets abroad in Germany, which are worth 10 billion US dollars." Regarding this point, Marshall denounced it as completely absurd. He also said that the United States has announced to the world the scientific and technical information obtained in Germany, so the Soviet Union should also announce this information. The meeting ended without results.</p>
<p>[This newspaper] London, broadcast on the 19th: When the four foreign ministers resumed the preliminary foundation discussion on the German peace treaty today, the US requested the Soviet Union to provide scientific and industrial secrets obtained from the captives. At 11 am, the four foreign secretaries held a meeting at the Aviation Club, chaired by the British foreign secretary, to study the technical issues of the Allied representatives participating in the German Reparations Committee, and to discuss the political terms of the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 19th] Observers here claimed today that the atmosphere at the first few meetings of the four foreign ministers was still stable and calm, but in recent days, US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin had continuous conflicts with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, which shows that the calm atmosphere has faded. According to the opinions of diplomatic observers, the Soviet Union is in a difficult situation regarding the issue of general national reparations. If Germany remains divided, the amount of reparations obtained by the Soviet Union in western Germany will be very small, or even nothing. If a broad general solution is followed to unify Germany, then the Soviet Union's desire to obtain a large number of German products to fill the demand for reparations will inevitably be abandoned, and it will have to jointly subsidize Germany's expenses with Western countries.</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov Announces Another Secret Agreement in Yalta Regarding Post-War Reparations in Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 18th] Molotov announced the content of another secret agreement in Yalta yesterday at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow, which is related to German reparations. One of the provisions stipulates that German industrial products can be used as reparations at any time. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office confirmed tonight that this secret agreement does exist, and the United States has not yet expressed its confirmation. If confirmed, it will have a significant impact on the discussions in Moscow, because the Soviet Union's pursuit of industrial production as reparations has been firmly opposed by Britain and the United States, which is the main obstacle to discussing the unification of the German economy.</p>
<p>Contents of the Secret Agreement</p>
<p>According to Tass, the content of the secret agreement announced by Molotov is as follows: The leaders of the British, American, and Soviet governments reached an agreement on the issue of German in-kind reparations at the Crimean Conference as follows: (1) Germany should compensate for the losses caused by Germany to the Allied countries during the war with in-kind, and the compensatory goods should be paid first to the country that bears the main responsibility for the war, the country that suffered the most losses, and the country that conspired to win. (2) The compensation materials extracted from Germany shall be in the following three forms: (a) Within two years after Germany's surrender or cessation of organized resistance, extract the main compensation materials from Germany's domestic or foreign German assets (such as equipment, machinery, ships, vehicles, foreign investments, equity in German industrial, transportation, shipping, and other enterprises, etc.); (b) Within a period to be determined after the end of the war, the products of German industry can be used as compensation every year; (c) The use of German labor. (3) After the detailed plan for extracting compensatory materials is established in accordance with the foregoing principles, the Allied Reparations Committee shall be established in Moscow by representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. (4) The US and Soviet delegations agreed on the determination of the total amount of compensation and the distribution to the countries invaded by Germany as follows: In the initial stage, the Moscow Reparations Committee should use the following suggestion of the Soviet government as the basis for discussion, that is, the total amount of compensation should be set at 20 billion yuan according to the provisions of Articles A and B of the previous article, of which 50% should be returned to the Soviet Union. The British delegation believes that the amount of compensation should not be mentioned before the Moscow Reparations Conference is discussed. The suggestions of the aforementioned US and Soviet delegations should be submitted to the Moscow Reparations Committee for review as proposals. The signatories to the agreement are Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.</p>
<p>Outstanding Issues</p>
<p>Since Molotov has published the secret agreement of Yalta, the question to be decided in the future is whether the secret agreement that allows German industrial products to be used as compensation will be regarded as a supplementary part of the Potsdam Agreement, or will it be abolished due to the emergence of the Potsdam Agreement. The Potsdam Agreement did not mention the use of German industrial products as compensation. Molotov believes that the two agreements should be used at the same time, because the first sentence of the chapter on compensation in the Potsdam Agreement is "According to the resolution of Crimea." Although the Potsdam Agreement only stipulates the removal of industrial equipment as compensation, it does not prohibit the use of industrial products as compensation. It only says that the payment of compensation should allow Germany to retain appropriate resources so that it can survive without external assistance. And the payment of German imports should be the primary responsibility of the German economy. According to authoritative sources, the United Kingdom opposes the use of industrial products as compensation because the extraction of industrial products will damage the payment of major imports, and the result is that the British people will bear the cost of the British occupation zone. According to the first secret agreement of Yalta, it was the secret agreement on the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan, which was previously announced on February 11, 1946. Observers in London were all surprised by the announcement of the second secret agreement this time. It is still remembered that on March 4, 1946, British Foreign Secretary McNeil answered the members of the House of Commons, expressing that in addition to the secret agreement announced on February 11, he did not know that there were other secrets, and said that if there were any, they would often be announced.</p>
<h3>The House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes US Foreign Relief Funds Our Country May Also Receive Assistance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington, 18th] The US House Foreign Affairs Committee temporarily passed a bill today stipulating that when the United Nations ends its work, it can allocate 350 million yuan to aid European countries, and China may be included. The case is expected to be formally passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee tomorrow, and it does not specifically indicate which countries can receive assistance, but the committee's report to the House of Representatives will specify the countries designated by Acting Secretary of State Jackson, namely Greece, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Italy. China may also be listed. The case has strict regulations on the needs of countries that may receive assistance.</p>
<p>Aid to Greece and Turkey to be Submitted for Discussion</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 18th] Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, today requested an immediate discussion of the bill to aid Greece and Turkey. It is reported that it may start tomorrow, and those who will attend the statement are Assistant Secretary of State Axon, Secretary of the Army Patterson, and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal. In addition to restricting military assistance to advisory nature, the legislative draft authorizes the government to supervise the use of aid, and stipulates that representatives of the US newspapers and radio industries can freely report without inspection. The case grants the President five broad powers: (1) to provide financial assistance in the form of loans, credit sales, and subsidies; (2) to send civil officials to assist Greece and Turkey; (3) to designate a limited number of soldiers to work in "advisory capacity"; (4) to supply materials, services, and information; (5) to train personnel from Greece and Turkey? However, this assistance shall not be transferred to another government. If the case is passed, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will pay 100 million US dollars first to facilitate the process. With the active support of Republican leaders, the government plans to complete the legislative procedures before the end of this month when the UK stops providing assistance.</p>
<p>Senators Vandenberg and Connally had a Conflict</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 18th] Republican Senator Vandenberg argued that the Senate should temporarily discuss Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey before the State Department answers many questions that are still being drafted. Vandenberg therefore clashed with Democratic Senator Connally. Vandenberg denied that he intended to obstruct the progress of the bill, and said: He believes that the Senate can begin the withdrawal of British troops in Greece this week.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 18th] The British Foreign Office revealed late on the 18th that the UK will not absolutely withdraw all personnel in Greece after March 31. The UK will continue to assist the Greek government with military, economic, legal, and police missions.</p>
<h3>France's Economic Plan for Germany Opposes Raising Germany's Industrial Level Agrees to Economic Unification but with Conditions</h3>
<p>[Reuters Moscow, 18th] French Foreign Minister Bidault expressed his views on the future economy of Germany at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today. His economic proposals may cause fundamental reforms to the European economy. The opinions stated by Bidault are mainly composed of copper, iron, and coal. He advocates that the iron in the Loraine province of Germany should no longer be supplied to the Ruhr steelmaking. The coal in the Ruhr should be supplied to France to enable France to manufacture steel, and Germany should focus on light industry. He advocates unlimited increase in coal production in the Ruhr region, but Germany's domestic coal consumption should be restricted, and the remaining quantity should be exported in a specified quantity every month. Germany's steel production should be strictly restricted, and the limitation of its production capacity must be specially studied. France believes that Germany's steel production must not exceed the limit of 5.8 million tons per year set by the Allied Management Committee a year ago. Regarding the issue of economic unification, Bidault said that France opposes the establishment of a central administrative body in Germany before Germany's borders are determined, but the French government believes that economic unification can be implemented in accordance with the memorandum it submitted in January this year. The other three foreign ministers had no response to Bidault's proposal for a while, but his proposal to limit Germany's steel production was clearly in conflict with Molotov's proposal yesterday. Molotov announced yesterday that he was willing to increase Germany's steel production to between 12 million and 14 million tons per year, and the United Kingdom and the United States have agreed to Molotov's proposal.</p>
<h3>Truman Returns to Washington</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] San Francisco, broadcast on the 19th: In view of the rapid development of domestic and foreign situations, Truman has ended his vacation and is preparing to fly back to Washington today. Since President Truman left Washington, changes have taken place in the diplomatic policies of the two parties. If it is allowed to deteriorate, it will affect Truman's consistent diplomatic policy of preventing the spread of the red tide in Greece and Turkey. The second is to persuade a part of the senators, who believe that Truman's policy towards Greece and Turkey is violating the limits of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>The French Communist Party's Distrust of the Government Rumors that the Ramadier Cabinet will Resign After Secret Discussions, the Prime Minister Said that the Government is Not in Crisis</h3>
<p>[United Press Paris, 19th] The French Parliament debated all night yesterday, and the Communist Party abstained from the vote of confidence in the government's Vietnam policy. The government's Vietnam policy bill was finally passed by a majority, but according to this morning's news, French Prime Minister Ramadier may submit his resignation to President Auriol before noon today. The Communist Party's abstention was due to an order from Deputy Prime Minister Thorez, the leader of the party, which was purely a manifestation of distrust of the government. Under such circumstances, according to French political traditions, it is tantamount to clearly stating that the Prime Minister must submit his resignation. Most observers believe that if the Ramadier government does not resign, Auriol will invite Ramadier to form a new cabinet that does not accommodate the Communist Party. The Communist Party's refusal to endorse the government's Vietnam policy arose from the government's rejection of the Communist Party's proposal to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>General de Gaulle, who has withdrawn from French practical politics, has been silent. Today, he suddenly announced that he will deliver an important speech when he attends the two-week anniversary of Strasbourg's liberation from the Germans on April 7.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Paris, 19th] Prime Minister Ramadier declared after a confidential cabinet meeting today: "The government has no right." The meeting lasted for hours, exchanging views on the political situation caused by the debate on the Vietnam situation at the General Assembly last night.</p>
<h3>Spain Plans to Formulate a Plan to Change the Monarchical System</h3>
<p>[Reuters Madrid, 18th] Well-informed sources close to the Franco government said: A small group of four officials has formulated a plan to declare Spain a monarchy ruled by an executive group, which will be submitted to the Spanish Cabinet Cesar. The executive group is headed by Franco. This step is the first step in the restoration. After the case is passed by the cabinet, it will be submitted to the Military Committee to draft a formal constitution, and then submitted to the Congress for approval. After the public votes, it is expected that all the procedures will take several days to complete.</p>
<h3>"Work to Survive": British Prime Minister Encourages the Nation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a broadcast address to the nation tonight, titled "Work to Survive," urging the people to exert their utmost effort to overcome the current planting difficulties. It is said that the British people have never been dismayed by difficulties. The greater the crisis, the stronger their desire to serve the country. We should strive for victory in peace, just as we strive for victory in war.</p>
<h3>U.S. Policy Inconsistency towards Europe and Asia: Congressmen to Raise Questions</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Some Republican congressmen have begun to question why the United States is allocating funds to assist the Near East to deter communism while withholding funds from China and Korea. According to several senior members of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees, who did not want to be named, they told this agency that "when Congress discusses President Truman's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, this point will be a major issue. The United States intends to withdraw from China and has not prevented communism in China and Korea, so why does it feel it is absolutely necessary to aid Greece and Turkey? This is something the authorities should answer satisfactorily." Republican Congressman Judd and other congressmen believe that the situation in China is no different from that in Greece and Turkey, and it is incomprehensible that the United States refuses to aid President Chiang Kai-shek. According to Congressman Vorys, he has discussed this matter with various congressmen, and most opinions believe that "if the United States is to take action, all of the United States' actions abroad must conform to the policies we adopt in the future." While Marshall is attending the meeting in Moscow and Truman is on vacation, the State Department clearly has no explanation for this contradiction. When acting Secretary of State Wilkinson was asked about this, he replied that the State Department was also aware of this contradiction, but could not think of an answer at the moment. Some people in the State Department, however, argue that there is no contradiction, as the guerrillas in Greece clearly have foreign aid, while there is no clear evidence of this in China. Generally, congressmen believe that if the United States' policy of deterring communism is to be implemented rationally, China should receive American aid.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Republican congressmen insisted today that the government's foreign policy, as well as its plans for China, Korea, Iran, Palestine, Hungary, and France, must be extensively reviewed before allowing the use of U.S. dollars to build a barrier against communism in Greece and Turkey.</p>
<h3>British Naval Construction Plan: Will Focus on Coping with Atomic Warfare; Cruiser "Aurora" to be Delivered to China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] Naval Undersecretary Dugdale presented the naval budget of £196,700,000 to the House of Commons today, and announced that the cruiser "Aurora" would soon be handed over to China. In addition, several cruisers, two small aircraft carriers, several destroyers, and several small ships have been or will soon be handed over to various self-governing dominions, Britain's allies, and India, some as gifts, some as sales, and some as loans. He also said that the production of naval aircraft is increasing, and only a few destroyers will be launched this year. There are no plans for other large-scale shipbuilding projects. Funds will be used for research, especially the effect of atomic bombs on naval tactics. Britain can no longer hope to have the world's largest navy, but hopes to have the best-equipped navy.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Shigeru Expresses Views, Praising MacArthur's Stance; Hopes U.S. Troops Will Not Withdraw After the Signing of the Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prime Minister Yoshida told United Press reporters today that if the United States wants to ensure world peace after the formal peace treaty is signed, U.S. troops must remain in Japan indefinitely. Yoshida predicted that a peace treaty with Japan could be concluded within the year, after which he would prefer the protection of the United States rather than a United Nations organization. Yoshida also said: "We are also at war with the Communist Party. There is an extremely dangerous enemy in the north that must be guarded against. President Truman's recent speech can be regarded as the United States' intention to lead the world in fighting communism. I dare to boldly declare that as long as the world situation is chaotic, the United States must continue to supervise Japan, which is beneficial to both the United States and Japan. Otherwise, all efforts to democratize Japan will be completely abandoned."</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prime Minister Yoshida issued a statement today, reading U.S. General MacArthur's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Japan and restore Japan's foreign trade as soon as possible. It is said that "MacArthur's remarks to reporters stationed in Tokyo on the 17th of this month are of great importance to the future of Japan. The world knows that MacArthur has faithfully implemented the occupation policy. These remarks show that he fully understands the current situation in Japan and fully understands the Japanese people. I dare to express my deep admiration for MacArthur's sympathy for Japan. The entire Japanese people feel the same way."</p>
<p>Acheson's Remarks</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Regarding the statement issued by General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, advocating for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the withdrawal of the occupation forces, and the transfer of Japan to the control of the United Nations, the State Department expressed a surprising reaction. Acting Secretary of State Acheson declared at a press conference that the State Department had not heard of MacArthur's statement beforehand, that it was purely his personal statement, and that for various practical reasons, the United States should deal with the European peace treaty before deciding on a peace treaty with Japan.</p>

<h3>Over Twenty Defendants Lacked Sufficient Evidence: Investigation of the Connaught Building Bloodshed Case Concluded; All Given Non-Prosecution Disposition; Chen Shijun Also Had No Premeditated Attempt to Assault People; Liang Renda's Part Awaits the Arrest of the Culprit for Further Handling</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "Connaught Building Bloodshed Case," which caused a stir and was of concern to the social community, has now been concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor, based on the spirit of judicial independence, fairly measured with an attitude of neither letting off the guilty nor wrongly accusing the innocent. It was believed that the defendants Cao Zhenkun, Shen Xiafeng, Wang Yuxiang, Wang Fugen, Cai Yutian, Chen Xun Guan, She Xue San, Liu Zongde, Xu Weicheng, Li Ruichun, Li Baxiong, Li Ruikang, Yang Jun, Shen Shikui, Meng Zhisheng, Zeng Yongquan, Zhu Yong, Ao Peikun, Dong Qiding, Jiang Laishun, Yang Xiaochu, Chen Shijun, etc. (including Liang Renda, who is deceased and therefore not listed), although the police bureau identified them as having committed crimes of disrupting order or abetting injury, etc., there was no corroborating evidence after investigation. It was difficult to establish them, so a non-prosecution disposition was granted. Prosecutor Liu Yongzhi's non-prosecution disposition document explained the case in two parts:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the part where Cao Zhenkun and other twenty-one defendants were sued for disrupting order. Cao Zhenkun, Shen Xiafeng, and other twenty-one defendants are all employees and machinists of Shanghai's New New, Sincere, Wing On, China National Products, China Textile, or other yarn factories, and are also mostly members of the Department Store Trade Union. On the morning of February 9, 1947, they participated in the "Speech Meeting" convened by the full board of directors and supervisors of the Three Districts Department Store Trade Union, which was responsible for the "Preparatory Committee for Loving National Goods and Resisting American Goods." When the meeting had not yet formally begun, a dispute occurred at the meeting site on the third floor of the China Industry Building on Nanjing East Road. The Municipal Police Bureau considered that the defendants Cao Zhenkun and other twenty-one defendants were not without brawling and injuring each other, and assisting the situation on the scene. They were suspected of violating the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 150 of the Criminal Law on disrupting order and were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>
<p>This office believes that disrupting order refers to hindering or disturbing the state of tranquility maintained by the country, and the constitution of the crime in Article 150 of the Criminal Law should have two essential elements: publicly gathering a crowd and implementing violence and coercion, lacking one</p>
<p>cannot be established. The investigation of the preparation of the "Love National Goods and Resist American Goods Association" was jointly responsible for by the directors and supervisors of the Three Districts Department Store Trade Union, Chen Shijun, Ding Shengya, Han Chengwu, Liu Caizhang, Mo Buyun, Lu Peiyu, Zhu Weiren, Ling Yuandi, Lu Hengfu, and other nine people. During the preparation period, they adopted joint responsibility, shared the work, and did not elect anyone to manage the association affairs. On February 9, department store employees were convened to meet on the third floor of the China Industry Building, and famous figures Luo Longji, Ma Xulun, Ma Yinchu, Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, and other famous figures were invited</p>
<p>to attend the speech (whether the association was approved or filed with the local competent party and government authorities is an administrative issue). Judging from the meaning of its organization, it was responding to the Love National Goods Movement launched by the Shanghai Municipal Council, intending to call on workers and manufacturers in various industries to participate and jointly plan the progress. On that day, only Guo Moruo and Deng Chumin were invited to attend, and the rest were absent due to various reasons. Before the start of the speech, no one could</p>
<p>dare to speculate what the content advocated. It is obvious that they had no intention of disrupting order and no act of violence and coercion. Subsequently, before the speech meeting had even begun, more than a hundred people suddenly arrived from outside, and the meeting place began to brawl. Sixteen of the defendants, including Wang Yuxiang, were all injured on the spot. The defendants firmly denied the implementation of violence and coercion, as well as the mutual fighting. Since these defendants were all injured people, and there was no corroborating evidence to confirm the defendants' participation in mutual fighting or assaulting people, the defendants themselves could not even point out who had harmed them. They only said that there were more than a hundred people dressed as workers, who came</p>
<p>bursting in through the door from outside and started hitting people when they saw them. Later, the Huangpu and Laoza Police Sub-bureaus, after being reported, arrived forty minutes late to rescue them. They only saw the defendants injured or fleeing in the chaos and arrested them. The assailants were nowhere to be found. This office summoned police personnel. According to their statements, it was impossible to prove who exactly committed the assault in this case. The reason why the defendants were arrested was because they were scattered and injured, which was just an emergency measure during the rescue.</p>
<p>After referring to the investigation reports, interview records, interrogation records, etc. of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau, the defendants were the victims who were beaten and injured, and there was no evidence of aiding, conspiracy, or publicly gathering a crowd, implementing violence and coercion, or other acts of assisting the masterminds that could be referred to. After considering the circumstances and deliberations, it is obviously difficult to question them with</p>
<p>any crime. In accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a non-prosecution disposition is given to seek fairness in the law and circumstances.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Meng Zhisheng, Chen Sihong, and Wang Yuxiang's accusation of Chen Shijun (Chairman of the Three Districts Department Store Trade Union) for the crime of abetting injury, the accusers were innocently beaten, and Chen, as the convener of the meeting, could not shirk his responsibility. The investigation revealed that the situation of the melee on the spot and Chen Shijun's leaving after being coerced out of the meeting place before even entering the meeting place were facts. Even if the meeting notice was issued by the association, there was no</p>
<p>premeditated attempt to assault people, and there was no factual basis to prove it. The accusers being injured in the melee was not Chen Shijun's criminal responsibility. The accusers' accusations were unreasonable, so a non-prosecution disposition was granted in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>As for Liang Renda (employee of Wing On Company), who attended the meeting on that day, was beaten and injured, and died from serious injuries, the culprits should be arrested and punished separately according to law.</p>

<h3>Chen Sancai's Martyrdom Case for Plotting to Assassinate Traitor Wang Jingwei: White Russian Informant Sentenced to Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Chen Sancai, former general manager of the North Pole Company, was engaged in underground work in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the plan to assassinate traitor Wang Zhaoming, the opportunity was not secretive, and he was betrayed by the White Russian Tao Jue. After being arrested, he died in Nanjing. After the victory, the White Russian was arrested by the authorities, and the Tsinghua Alumni Association and others repeatedly requested that he be severely punished. It is now learned that Tao Ci has been sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment by the High Court on the 15th of this month. According to Chen Sancai, who was affiliated with the Military Statistics Bureau, he secretly plotted to assassinate Wang Jingwei with the White Russian Tao Ci and others. Because he refused Tao Ci's request for a huge amount of money, he was sold out and reported to the puppet government. Chen's residence was in Meiliyuan on Daxilu Road, which was then called a "bad area." In mid-July of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Tao Ci led puppet government personnel to arrest Chen and escort him to Nanjing. Wang initially did not intend to harm him, but lured him with false positions such as Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications, but Chen was unmoved. Later, Wang was assassinated again, and he resented Chen, so he was tied to Yuhuatai and executed by shooting on October 2 of that year. When Chen was arrested, his cousin Tang Huiyu was also arrested and released soon after. He heard in prison that the whole incident was secretly harmed by the White Russian Tao Jue, so after he was released from prison, he reported to the Engineering Bureau to detain Tao Ci once in the Jing'an Temple Police Station, but he was released due to the pressure from the 76th. However, he secretly took a photo of Tao Ci as evidence. After the victory, he reported the situation to General Dai Li. Unexpectedly, Tao Ci turned to work for the Zhongyi Salvation Army in the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, so he was not prosecuted at first. Later, at the strong request of the relatives and friends of the victim, Tao Ci and his brother were arrested in January last year. Recently, the Tsinghua Alumni Association and the United Youth Association requested the authorities to quickly convict him. On the morning of the 15th of this month, the High Court sentenced him to 15 years of imprisonment for the crime of colluding with the enemy country, and his brother was declared innocent.</p>
<h3>Wu Yimin Denies Serving as Enemy Secret Agent in Retrial</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Wu Yimin, who had served as an enemy military police secret agent, was accused of being a traitor. The High Court had previously sentenced him to life imprisonment. Wu was dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which remanded the case for retrial. The High Court reopened the investigation court yesterday for questioning. During the occupation of Shanghai, Wu worked in the telegraph bureau managed by the enemy army. Later, due to his acquaintance with Sasuke Saeki of the Shanghai Kempeitai, he served as a secret agent for the team. In May of the 34th year of the Republic of China, he learned that Wang Jianying, a neighbor of his friend Yang Qigao, was serving in the Southeast Training Class of the Zhongyi Salvation Army in Quzhou. He came to Shanghai, and soon he would accompany Bian Qigao to Quzhou. Wu secretly reported it to the enemy military police team, and Yang Zhu and others were arrested and detained for more than a month before being freed. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Yang Wang reported to the police bureau, and Wu was arrested and brought to justice. Wu argued in court yesterday that he admitted that he had worked as a telegraph bureau employee, but denied that he had served as an enemy military police secret agent. Regarding the arrest of Yang Wang, he also claimed that he did not know about it. The court interrogated him for a long time, and because further investigation was needed, he was ordered to reschedule the trial.</p>

<h3>Puppet Agent Lü Fugang's Crimes Confirmed, Two Victims Jointly Report His Treachery to the Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] After puppet agent Lü Fugang was arrested by the Lao Zha Police Bureau, he was taken to Madunhe Hat Shop on Wangping Street and Jigeng Lane the day before yesterday for identification, as detailed in yesterday's report. Yesterday, Zhu Guangyuan (30 years old, from Xuzhou, residing at 105 Yükang Road, currently a captain trainee in the palace corps of the 29th Army of the Central Training Corps) and Xu Zhaogui (from Xinghua, 37 years old, residing at 5 Lane 5, Yongqingli, Xiaosadu Road, currently a worker at the Asia Oil Drum Factory in Pudong) went to the branch bureau together to report.</p>
<p>They claimed that in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938], they were ordered by the Military Intelligence Bureau to come to Shanghai from Hankou to undertake underground work. In September of the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941], they were ordered by their superiors to recruit patriotic elements as much as possible. At that time, a friend of Xu introduced Lü Fugang to them, and Xu then recommended him to Zhu for enrollment as a team member. Unexpectedly, Xia Zhongming, the chief of the puppet investigation and statistics department, learned of this and sent his henchmen to lure Lü with benefits. Lü eventually betrayed them and even colluded with the Japanese military police to raid the residence of an old woman in Meifangli, Roberts Road, seizing a list of names of Zhu and Xu. On October 18 of the same year, Lü also led the Hongkou Military Police Corps and personnel from the Fourth Road Patrol to Xu's residence at 5 Lane 5, Yongqingli, Xiaosadu Road. Xu happened to be out, so they arrested his wife, Xiao Lanhua. Xiao Lanhua, unable to endure the torture, was forced to lead them to the residence of their friend Zhao Laimin on Wuding Road, where they arrested Zhu and Xu. They were taken back to the military police headquarters and subjected to all kinds of torture. Later, they were transferred to the No. 76 headquarters, where they were again beaten and forced to confess. In February of the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942], they were transferred to the puppet "Rehabilitation Institute" in Nanjing, where they were detained until they were released in March of the 33rd year of the Republic of China [1944]. Now, having read in the newspaper that Lü Fugang has been arrested, they have come to the bureau to report and request severe punishment according to the law. Branch Chief Shi immediately brought Lü to confront them, and Lü admitted that the facts were true and did not deny anything.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Advisor</h3>
<p>Inheritance Dispute</p>
<p>Zhang Rulin: A's son, B, was adopted into the clan of C when he was young (registered with the county government). C later died of illness, and B was still taken back by A to raise. At the same time, C's mother wrote a will stating that all of C's property belonged to B. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China [1944], B died of illness in Sichuan, and C's sister took the opportunity to overturn the previous case, wanting to divide C's property equally with B (after B's death, A adopted his nephew as the heir). At that time, A was intimidated by the power of B's sister (her husband held a position in the puppet government and had considerable influence), and had to sign his name to acknowledge it, but he was not satisfied. He asks: (1) Can C's mother's will, witnessed and written by clan relatives and friends, take effect? (2) Is a document forcibly signed under duress during the enemy-puppet period valid? (3) Does B's nephew have inheritance rights after B's death? (4) Does C's sister's husband have inheritance rights to her property? (5) Can A file a case with the court to request the maintenance of the original case?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) Valid, (2) There must be evidence of reliance on enemy-puppet power, (3) No, (4) Illegal, (5) It depends on the interpretation of the situation.</p>

<h3>Overview of Education in Suzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou, 19th dispatch] Wang Zhirui, Director of the Wu County Education Bureau, met with our reporter and provided the following comprehensive overview of the current state of education in Suzhou: Education in the county has improved significantly compared to the past. According to statistics, there are a total of 31 public and private middle schools in the county, with 186 classes and approximately 8,300 students. There are 290 national schools with 772 classes. There are currently 345 classes in people's education, with a total of more than 38,000 students. In addition, there are 59 private primary schools with 267 classes and approximately 14,500 students. There are approximately 2,000 teachers and staff, with monthly expenses exceeding 289 million yuan, exceeding 30% of the county's expenses. However, such a large figure can only cover salaries and benefits, with not a penny left for operational expenses. Although the locality has 16,000 mu of academic land and dozens of properties, the income is extremely meager, less than 30%. The future direction for developing national education is to tentatively maintain the status quo in urban areas while expanding it to rural areas.

<h3>From the World Games to the National Games (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Wang Weijun</p>
<p>Holding the National Games this year has at least two major significances: (1) The World Games, to be held in England next August, is the first after the victory of the United Nations, and has profound significance. It is not only a restoration of pre-war international sports activities but also related to international relations, cooperation, and diplomacy. Our country, having joined the ranks of the four major powers as a result of this victory, has greatly increased its international status. We must not lag behind in anything, and the same goes for sports. We should select athletes from various sports to represent us in the Games, and the more representatives we send, the better. If limited by a lack of talent, the number of representatives sent should not be less than the number sent to the previous World Games (the total number of representatives sent by our country to the previous World Games was 120). At least it should not be fewer than the previous number. As for the quality of the results, whether or not we score points, we need not worry about that. We can use the great opportunity of sending representatives to next year's World Games to observe and learn from others, using it as a way to gain assistance from others. We can only produce representatives to participate in the World Games by holding a National Games of an overall nature, using it to select outstanding athletes as representatives, and then providing them with a period of training and cultivation in various skills.</p>
<p>(2) Our country has been affected by the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and the National Games have been suspended for many years. Now that we have achieved complete victory for nearly two years, not only has our international status increased day by day, but the whole country has also gained more consolidated benefits from the victory (naturally, except for a small number of traitors who have betrayed their conscience). We are making greater efforts to promote the future of reconstruction, and the sports industry is of great importance to the future of reconstruction and the health of the entire nation. We should quickly seek to restore the National Games to demonstrate and promote the widespread emphasis on sports. Most importantly, in order to show the symbolism of national unity, peace and solidarity after the victory, manifested in sports activities, there is even more need to hold the National Games. As for the location of this National Games, I believe that in terms of the significance of victory and unity, holding it in the capital is most appropriate. If, in order to take care of the actual situation and reduce financial difficulties slightly, we make use of previously used venues, slightly repairing and rebuilding them to save expenses, and pay attention to the most convenient issues of transportation and hospitality, etc., then Shanghai is also suitable for holding this National Games. Even more fruitfully, there will certainly be many spectators in Shanghai, thereby increasing revenue to make up for deficits, which is more certain than in other places.</p>
<p>In summary, although these are just my personal views, I believe that the entire sports community in the country has the same feeling and unanimously hopes that this year's National Games can be held, and that preparations for all aspects can be started as soon as possible. We hope that the government authorities can take into account the above two major significances and find ways to overcome the financial difficulties and realize it as soon as possible. (End)</p>

<h3>The Stock Exchange's So-Called "Temporary Measures" Now Also Levy a Special Margin on Sellers, Collecting 10% of the Transaction Price and Requiring Cash Payment</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Stock Exchange has decided that, starting from today's market, it will also collect a special margin of 10% of the transaction price for deferred delivery transactions made by brokers on the seller's side, and all will be collected in cash. According to a spokesperson for the Stock Exchange, the Exchange previously increased the special margin for border trade by 10% because of the recent surge in the stock market. Recently, the market has gradually stabilized, so the special margin for sellers has been increased by 10% to show fairness. However, this is a temporary measure to cope with irregular rises and falls in the stock market and will be canceled once the market trend returns to normal. The Exchange originally offered two types of deferred delivery, Tuesday and Friday. The former, due to sluggish trading, was announced to be suspended from last Saturday, so now only Friday delivery is offered. As for large-scale transactions, they are still proceeding according to the pre-determined plan and have not been interrupted. The telephone is now being set up, and once the work is completed, it can be started. The securities for large-scale transactions have been decided to first open for auction Yongsha, Xinho, Xinguang, and Huafeng Enamel. The trading unit is 50,000 shares for all except Huafeng Enamel, which is 100,000 shares. The brokers engaged in large-scale transactions are currently limited to the top 39 brokers with the most transactions on the Stock Exchange.</p>
<h3>Sparse Transactions in Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Although the fall of Chinese stocks was not very large yesterday, due to mixed news and many changes, rising and falling suddenly, after the increase of a special margin of 10% for sellers starting this afternoon, buyers panicked, and the market finally collapsed, ending at low prices. The morning opened flat and sluggish, and it was difficult to cheer up. After the opening, Siam Yongsha was sold off by numbers 224, 76, 133, 2, 121, 32, 188, and 104 and fell to 2630 yuan. Numbers 76, 12, 14, 218, and 112 took advantage of the low price to maintain and gradually rebounded. When numbers 4, 89, 171, 68, 180, 198, and 149 all entered, they gradually pulled up to about 2770 yuan. Numbers 61, 4, 197, 218, 101, and 117 sold off at high prices, and near noon, it once returned to 2700 yuan. Numbers 177, 171, and 112 maintained it somewhat, and the afternoon closed rose to above 2730 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Maya, Huaji, and Xinguang Jingfu fell slightly, while Xinho, Zhongfa Quanxing, and Xinhua rose slightly. Deferred delivery Yongsha and Xinho rose slightly, Huafeng and Xinguang fell slightly, and Maya fell by half a percent weakly. The cold stock Rongfeng had little demand and little supply and rose alone by more than 10%, Lilian and Zhongfang each rose strongly by half a percent, and the rest saw both rises and falls.</p>
<p>Only odd-lot trading was done in the afternoon, and the news of new currency in the night report caused fluctuations again, and numbers 218 and 99 both entered, pulling up to 2830 yuan. Rongfeng was priced high by numbers 104 and 198 to the limit up, Yongsha fell back to 273 yuan because numbers 185, 97, 226, 223, 172, 4, and 61 all sold. Number 198 immediately entered after exiting, and the market announced that starting from the afternoon of the 20th, a special margin of 10% would be increased for sellers. It immediately stirred, rising to 2820 yuan. Numbers 205, 156, 223, 22, and 198 sold off, falling to 2640 yuan. Under the maintenance of number 152, there was a slight struggle, but as the general trend was gone, numbers 231, 112, and 14 were sold off and fell to 2590 yuan. Maya was forced to stop, and Xinya fell to the limit down. There was a slight consolidation near the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Xinho, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Zhongfa each fell by half a percent, Maya fell by 10%, and Xinhua and Qinxing fell slightly. Off-market stocks Dasheng was flat, and the rest saw very slight rises and falls.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Decline</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks declined slightly yesterday, and Yisha gradually declined from 18250 yuan to end at a low price. Foreign firms successively absorbed, and Paper and Yibei were quite colorful. As a result, compared with the previous close, Paper rose by half a percent, Yibei Steel rose slightly, Yeguang returned slightly by half a percent weakly, and the rest were slightly frustrated.</p>
<h3>Mediocre Uniform-Price Transactions</h3>
<p>Public bonds were very mediocre yesterday, and the rises and falls were narrow. Tongbing opened in the morning at 10500 yuan, and the low price was seen at 9800 yuan before short covering activities began, rising to 10800 yuan and closing in a stalemate. The after-hours dark market called high to 11800 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu each fell by 700 yuan, and Bing fell by 800 yuan, with a turnover of about 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Small-Loan Committee Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>Maximum Loan Amount of 500,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Small-Loan Committee held its first meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attending were Cai Dianrong, Sun Yongyi, Jiang Jianhou, Wang Xianqing, and several others. The chairman, Cai Dianrong, reported, stating that the Shanghai Winter Relief Association had allocated 100 million yuan as funds and had elected colleagues to organize the Shanghai Small-Loan Committee to handle small-loan affairs. The association's charter was then revised and passed. The loan amount was temporarily decided to be divided into three levels: 200,000, 400,000, and 500,000 yuan. The loan term was stipulated to be four months each time, with monthly interest payments and four installments to be paid off in full. Each person was limited to one loan and could not apply for renewal. The loan guarantee was based on one shop guarantee or two personal guarantees, and the interest rate was stipulated to be 2% per month. The meeting decided to hold a meeting on March 25, at which time the director of the Public Pawnshop would also be invited to attend. Furthermore, it was decided that small loans would be handled regularly in the future, and after the end of this Winter Relief Association, the association would be responsible for handling it, and all matters would be reported in detail to the next Winter Relief Association on the handling process.</p>
<h3>Stabilized Grain and Rice Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The total amount of rice from the north and south markets arriving yesterday was 8,000 piculs. The southern market's japonica rice was firm in the early morning and slack in the afternoon, and the result was stable. Indica rice had little fluctuations. The northern market was dull and had little energy, and a drop of 1,000 yuan was seen.</p>
<p>There was still a lot of inland flour arriving. Local flour was stable and fair, and foreign flour was still popular. Bran fell sharply after opening, plunging 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake customer sales turned active, and it was stable in the morning and firm in the afternoon, with a slight upward trend.</p>
<p>There were both rises and falls in soybeans. Northeastern soybeans and Nanyang purchases saw a rise of 1,000 yuan. Local absorption of Duzhou and Han soybeans was not strong and remained mediocre. Nanyang picked high-quality tea beans, and the shape was commercially fixed and dull. Red beans were widely sold and very fine, with a flat pattern.</p>
<p>Red sorghum was in a dull and flat situation, and corn was sluggish and stagnant, with a drop of 1,000 yuan. Broad beans were firm, raw kernels were rising, sesame was trending upward, and cylinder beans from Shantou continued to sell, rising continuously by 1-2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Qingdao goods continued to arrive in the sleeve market. Crude oil was exhausted again by 3-5,000 yuan, and the remaining goods were flat.</p>
<h3>The Local Money Supply Has Shown Signs of Loosening</h3>
<p>Recently, the local money supply has shown signs of easing. Yesterday, the exchange house's exchange notes before number 50 were 4,872, with a total amount of 283.75 billion, 17,100 yuan. Exchange notes after number 50 were 56,688, with a total amount of 306.689 billion, 317,772 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen. The head-to-head position of the four banks and two bureaus was 1.8 billion, while the highest peak of passing the head-to-head position during tight money was 210 billion. According to senior figures in the financial community, the inherent reasons are nothing more than: (1) the accelerated implementation of the emergency economic measures plan has been effective. (2) Recently, the government's absorption of money supply in the market has actually decreased, and the most prominent is the suspension of gold sales, which is about the active aspect. The lack of price increases for public utilities on the negative side is not irrelevant. (3) General speculators and hoarders have a sense of caution. (4) The Strengthening Control of the Import Management Committee has designated banks to purchase little foreign exchange. (5) Commercial firms abide by laws and regulations to reduce fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Cedar Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>The market price of cedar continues to weaken. It is heard that a large Chinese ship continues to arrive, but due to cost considerations, the market price is not easy to return to a large extent. Due to the difficulty of importing and the difficulty of replenishing, foreign pine is still at the 4,000 yuan level.</p>
<h3>Bill Acceptance Fee Should Not Exceed 1/1000th of Face Value</h3>
<p>The Joint Office of the Central, Agricultural, Communications, and Farmer's Banks stated that at present, in addition to mortgages, most banks adopt the discount method for handling industrial and commercial loans, and four brand names, namely the drawer, acceptor, discounter, and guarantor, must be issued, and the bank must accept them. The procedures are extremely complicated, and the accepting bank must also charge a handling fee of 1/1000th to 1.5/1000th due to liability reasons, which is equivalent to increasing interest and increasing the burden on industrial and commercial operators. It has telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance to find a way to improve the situation. It is known that regarding this matter, the Ministry of Finance has recently telegraphed the audit office of the Central Bank, stating that the handling fee charged by banks for accepting or guaranteeing bills of exchange shall not exceed 5/1000th of the face value in accordance with Article 9 of the Measures for Acceptance and Discount of Bills of Exchange. However, due to the recent surge in market interest rates, bank operating expenses have also increased significantly compared with the past. In order to take into account the facts and bank operating income and to prevent extra demands, the handling fee should be appropriately increased to 1/1000th. The Ministry of Finance has revised Article 9 of the Measures and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. In the future, the handling fee charged by various firms for acceptance shall not exceed 1/1000th of the face value, and it is hoped that they will pay attention to reporting at any time and transfer it to the department for verification, so as to investigate and handle the matter. The audit office of the Central Bank has sent a circular to various firms, earnestly complying with the above.</p>
<h3>Sugar Falls Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded to be soft, and white sugar saw a fall. The guild's planned disk, such as 22 Zhongsha white, was 216,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan, a drop of nearly 10,000 yuan. The drop in 24 coarse white was greater, at 225,000 yuan to 218,000 yuan. Semi-four-wheeler white was a small 5,000 yuan, and semi-three-wheeler white was a small 10,000 yuan. Peruvian fine sand was initially 203,211,000 yuan, and later 199,000 yuan, a small 4-5,000 yuan. The rise and fall of Taiwan was also slight after the initial exhaustion. In the morning, it was 143-4,000 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was 8,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan. Shantou Qing opened at 131-2,000 yuan, Shunde Qing at 128,500 yuan, Diao Qing at 124,000 yuan, Xinghua White at 191-2,000 yuan, Xing Chi at 131,000 yuan, and a total of 6-700 pieces were traded.</p>
<h3>U.S. Acutely Needs Tung Oil, Price Distance Is Still Far</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office: the recent production of tung oil in the United States is only 10 million pounds per year, and the U.S. paint industry needs tung oil, so it feels extremely short. Before 1941, the amount of tung oil exported from our country to the United States reached 80 million pounds per year, and it was once suspended after the war, but it was restored last year. In terms of the amount of tung oil exported from our country to the United States from January to June alone, it has reached 50 million pounds. The only difficulty at present is that the prices between the two sides have not been close. According to the survey: the price of tung oil in the United States in December last year was about 3.95 U.S. dollars per pound. Recently, the price has gradually moved downstream, to about 3.6 dollars per pound. The price in this city is also 3.4 dollars per pound. If shipping costs, insurance costs, tariffs, etc. are added, selling in the United States will inevitably result in losses. The office is now planning to investigate the actual amount of tung oil that can be exported in this city and at the same time investigate the actual prices of tung oil in the United States and this city in order to find a reasonable solution.</p>
<h3>Weak Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions initially inherited the remaining power from the previous day, and the prices were quite firm and expensive. However, as the wind of currency reform subsided, people's hearts suddenly softened, and new buyers frequently sold off. It was also heard that the prices in Yuehan and other places still had an inversion phenomenon, resulting in a decline in buying power. By the time the market closed, the buying power of various roads did not move, and the actual sales in this street were also mediocre. Therefore, as a result, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth fell to 159,000 yuan, a reduction of 3,500 yuan. Blue Phoenix, Blue Yang, and Color Ball and other brands also fell from 2,000 yuan to 4-5,000 yuan. However, bleached cloth and twill poplin were popular due to the order relationship, and the rest of the colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Yarn and Cloth Shipped South</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Hanmin transport sailed to Guangdong yesterday, loaded with 1,850 pieces of cloth, more than 460 pieces of cotton yarn, more than 5,960 bags of raw kernels, 220 bags of beans, and more than 2,000 pieces of groceries, which were transported to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Fall, Transactions are Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market began to decline. In the initial outcry to sell, the 20 count yarns of various brands fell in a straight line, but buyers still could not muster interest, resulting in sparse transactions. Both 20 count yarns and group yarns fell 100,000 to 150,000, and people's hearts turned weak again.</p>
<h3>Fangjian Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>Also reported: yesterday, the Yarn Construction Company routinely sold various cotton yarns, with 42 count Maodie listed at 6.15 million, 20 count Jinshuangma at 3.2 million, and Jinji at 3.04 million. The market was very rare, and manufacturers were sluggish in absorption. Customer groups also cleared slowly. Moreover, Jinbang temporarily stopped transporting north due to the fact that the transfer of funds to set yarn was not profitable. The intention to enter was weak, so 42 count Blue Phoenix shouted 7.2 million yuan, and 32 count shouted 5.5 million yuan, a decrease of 2-300,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Transactions were also only 22 packages.</p>
<h3>Fangjian Sells Yarn as Usual, Totaling 2,682 Pieces</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company routinely sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee, selling a total of 2,682 pieces, including 2,325 pieces from manufacturers and 357 pieces of yarn numbers. A total of 1,246 households applied, including 890 manufacturer households and 356 yarn number households.</p>
<h3>Expenditures are Executed in Accordance with the Budget, the National Treasury is in Good Condition, Currency Reform is Not Yet the Time</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Xia Jinxiong, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, told reporters yesterday: At present, the expenditures of the National Treasury are executed in accordance with the budget, and the situation is quite good. As for the income part, if the sale of state-owned enterprises and foreign borrowing are smooth, the situation will be greatly improved. Since the implementation of the measures for the deposit of public funds of military and political organs in November last year, remittances have almost all been done, but deposits have not been fully withdrawn and deposited in the Central Bank because various organs have long-term relationships with other national banks, and they must be withdrawn before they can be deposited. At present, the general economic situation has been effective since the implementation of the new economic plan, but from a long-term perspective, it still needs to be coordinated with other measures. In terms of travel expenses, there is no proper outlet, and even if it is used for production, it still requires a process of three to five months. In today's securities market, some securities play a role equivalent to chips and cannot be interpreted as investment. It is not yet the time to change the currency system to a gold standard, because the prerequisite for reform is a balance of financial revenue and expenditure. After the First World War, the currency reforms of Britain and France had a preparation period between 1922 and 1925. Countries participating in the International Monetary Fund do not have to adopt the gold standard, because today's international payments are in the form of trade and do not transport gold. As for the abolition of the Four United Offices, it is worth studying. In theory, the existence of this system has both advantages and disadvantages. While the strength of the Central Bank is not strong enough, the Four United Offices should still be retained. Regarding the requisition of deposits in the United States, Xia believes that under the political system and national conditions of the United States, it is difficult to become a reality. Furthermore, Xia was summoned by the Ministry of Finance and was heard to have boarded a train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittance Amounts Increase Fivefold in February</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The total amount of overseas remittances from all parts of the Bank of China in February reached 8,275,000,000 yuan in national currency. This is more than five times the figure for January. Even if the exchange rate is reduced by three times, it can be seen that the amount of remittances in February exceeded that of January. As for the detailed figures for each place, they are still being settled. However, it is known that the increase in overseas remittances from Nanyang was the most significant in February, and the remittance of funds from the Philippines also started in February.</p>
<h3>Tea Market is Loose</h3>
<p>It has been found that various types of domestic sales tea, except for Longjing and Zhulan varieties, have little sales in this street and in Wuxi. The rest are quiet, so people's hearts are powerless to be good, and the market is flat and stable. As for the foreign firm tea market, the market situation of Qimen black tea continues to be exhausted, because the owners of general adjustment funds are still selling, so it still creates opportunities for buyers to suppress prices, and as a result, the market is mostly downstream again. Other export green teas are still tradable, but the process is obviously weak. In this case, the foot of the tea market has frequently revealed a loose appearance.</p>
<h3>Silk Calling Prices are Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>The silk market was quite quiet yesterday, and the calling prices were generally firm and stable. No. 120 High Mountain Glossy Rayon opened at 6.45 million yuan in the morning and closed at 500,000 yuan at noon. It shouted a sale of 450,000 yuan in the afternoon and revolved between 450,000 yuan and 500,000 yuan all day without much rise or fall. There were many arrivals of Western silk from the place of origin, such as No. 75 semi-gloss and No. 100 non-gloss, all of which are simply ten goods, each with 200 pounds of net silk. The former called a price of 11 million yuan, and the latter was priced at 8.2-300,000 yuan. The calling price of the factory Jing was similar to that of the previous yesterday, and D grade was traded at 7.05 million yuan yesterday. The second-hand goods were slightly active, and the Dachenggeshibi was called for 17,000 yuan, and traded for 6,800 yuan. The price of rayon feather yarn was 5,400 yuan, and the sales were quite good.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Situation of Chinese Merchants Improves</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] It is understood that recently, the smuggling situation on the Chinese side has gradually improved since the authorities dispatched two more teams of military police to patrol the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and two patrol ships to take charge of the sea inspection work. It is understood that in the past, smuggled goods in that area mostly relied on armed protection and were mostly equipped with sophisticated weapons. Now, as the authorities have increased the strength of the anti-smuggling team, the wind of smuggling has gradually disappeared.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Discuss This Year's Tea Loan Today</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank will hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today to plan this year's tea loan, inviting the China Tea Association, the Tea Export Association, and the Southeast Tea Area United Association to listen to opinions and conduct preliminary discussions. According to tea merchants, the highest peak of this year's production is expected to be 1.4 million dans, and the number of tea merchants in various places will also increase to 1,600.</p>
<h3>Gallnuts are Firm</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Due to frequent price increases in the place of origin and scarce arrivals, the market for Du Wu and Tong Pei rebounded again yesterday. Tong Pei was 350,000 yuan per Sima Dan, and Du Pei was 360,000 yuan, an increase of about 40,000 yuan compared with the previous week. According to industry insiders, Pei Fen cannot be exported recently because domestic sales are widespread and the price difference between domestic and foreign prices is too large.</p>

<h3>Enemy Property Management Bureau Announces Statistics on Total Value of Seized Enemy Assets</h3>
<p>The Enemy Property Management Bureau recently announced that from its establishment in December of the 134th year of the Republic [1945] to December of the 135th year of the Republic [1946], the total value of enemy and puppet assets seized amounted to 1,202,477,415,210 national currency. Broken down by the source of seizure, those seized from the Japanese enemy accounted for 868,348,350,481 national currency, approximately 72.24% of the total. Those seized from various puppet organizations accounted for 295,853,840,265 national currency, approximately 24.61%. Those seized from German enemy organizations accounted for 38,275,224,463 national currency, approximately 3.5% of the total. In addition, enemy and puppet properties and materials discovered based on confidential reports amounted to 17,626,554,614 national currency. Furthermore, factories and real estate, etc., that were investigated and returned to their owners, still contained assets and equipment enhanced by the enemy and puppets, which should be nationalized, amounting to 44,704,804,568 national currency. The total value of all the above-mentioned properties is approximately 1,264,808,774,393 national currency. If categorized by the type of asset, factories held the greatest value, followed by raw materials and finished products. Other categories, in descending order of value, included gold and silver jewelry, real estate, docks, warehouses, ships, vehicles, grain, fuel, currency, farms, schools, aquatic products, securities, and furniture, etc. The bureau has been progressively handling these assets according to law. The value of the various assets already processed and the estimated value of the remaining assets are listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Value of Assets Processed　Estimated Value of Remaining Assets</p>
<p>Materials　190,435　128,954</p>

<h3>General Wang Yaowu's Style in Shandong</h3>
<p>— Jinan, 14th, Air Dispatch, Our Special Correspondent, Li Tian</p>
<p>In February of last year, General Wang Yaowu, who had been serving as the Commander of the Fourth War Area in Hunan, was appointed by the conference as the Commander of the Second Pacification Zone, commanding the Shandong battles. He was personally seen off to Jinan by He Yingqin, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army. At that time, in Shandong, apart from larger strongholds such as Jinan, Qingdao, Weixian [Weifang], Gunzhou, Dexian, and Tai'an, 85% of the province's area was in the hands of the Communist army. When Wang Yaowu arrived in Jinan, apart from the staff of the former Fourth War Area Command, it was a time when the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks were loudly advocated. Military movements were not permitted by the agreement. Not only could he not bring his so-called well-trained troops from the past, but even the special service regiment of his guards from the Fourth War Area era was not allowed to enter Shandong.</p>
<p>At that time, in Jinan, there were only the two divisions of the 12th Army and the 96th Army, which were equipped with old equipment. In Weixian and Qingdao, there were only the 8th Army (newly equipped) and one division of the 96th Army. In addition, there were a few local teams that lacked both supplies and ammunition. Their fighting power was so weak that Chen Yi, Commander of the Shandong Field Army District of the Communist Party and concurrently Commander of the New Fourth Army, who was ordered by Yan'an on March 1st to come to Jinan to negotiate with Commander Wang on how to implement the ceasefire order, bluntly and impolitely said to Commander Wang:</p>
<p>"Your troops are all second- and third-rate troops, and their fighting power is completely unreliable. If we want to prepare to attack Jinan, we can take it down at any time."</p>
<p>Chen Yi's attitude was quite arrogant. Commander Wang replied without hesitation and very clearly: "Indeed, my troops may be second- or third-rate troops, but you must know that after being trained by me, Wang Yaowu, these second- or third-rate troops will become first-rate troops within a month!"</p>
<p>Four Main Reasons for the Shandong Situation</p>
<p>The main reasons for the entire Shandong situation evolving to the difficult state it is in today are due to: (1) The Communist army began operating in Shandong since the July 7th Incident [1937]. Until the eve of victory, except for the transportation lines and cities controlled by the Japanese puppets, almost the entire province was in their grasp. At this time, the Communist army's strength had already expanded to nearly 200,000 men. (2) After the victory, the central government sent General Li Yannian to lead the 12th Army and the 96th Army from Fuyang, Anhui into Shandong. Because of the long journey and the need to remove obstacles from the Communist army along the way, they only arrived in Jinan on the Double Tenth Festival of the 34th year of the Republic [October 10, 1945]. Before this, local teams and miscellaneous troops in various places competed to take over. Roughly calculated, although they took over about 80%, because the command was not unified, there was no talk of cooperation. The Communist army, with its superior position, naturally had the advantage of being the first to take the spoils. Thus, by means of individual attacks, they took over again from the takeover units, resulting in the land and materials seized from the enemy puppets, except for a few cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang, falling into the hands of the Communist army again. (3) Li Yannian implemented the central government's downsizing policy too strictly, reducing the original guerrilla teams and local forces that had been eroded by the Communist army in Shandong for eight years to nothing. Conversely, in the past year or so, the regular Communist army in Shandong has expanded from 200,000 to 439,300 men. If the troops transferred from the Northeast are included, it would be no less than 500,000 men. (4) Most importantly, the three ceasefire orders on January 13, June 8, and November 11 of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], which were actually only unilateral obligations of the National Army, caused the National Army to miss many valuable opportunities and become a situation of passively taking beatings. Conversely, the Communist army took the opportunity to isolate the National Army's strongholds, hard-attack and soft-eat, and defeat them one by one. Among them, the key points of Dezhou, Tai'an, and DaWenkou were captured by the Communist army within ten days after the second ceasefire order on June 8 of last year. If these three key points had remained in the hands of the National Army, it is unknown how much unnecessary sacrifice and loss would have been reduced today in opening up the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi Failed to Capture Jinan and Admitted "Head-on Collision"; Wang Yaowu Opened Up the Jiaoji Railway in 100 Days</h3>
<p>Commander Wang Yaowu came to Jinan in such a grim situation and handled the Shandong situation under such a premise. The difficulty of his task and the burden on his shoulders, in the 38 provinces of the country, who could find a second province with a more serious situation than this? But Commander Wang did not complain about it. On the contrary, he silently led his excellent staff, first organized a cadre training class, and trained middle and lower-level officers below the regimental commander in stages, ten days per term, focusing on political awareness, thereby improving morale. The trained officers, after returning to their units, further trained their subordinates. In political training, there was also military training. From the training, Wang recognized the main officers of each unit and understood the capabilities of each unit. Thus, in deployment, he chose their strengths and assigned them appropriate tasks. The effect of the training was great. In less than two months, the original demoralized troops became vigorous, and their combat power increased at least five times compared to before. From the end of May to mid-June, Chen Yi launched more than 100,000 troops to besiege Jinan, fully believing that these second- and third-rate troops could be easily captured. Unexpectedly, after besieging for more than 20 days, apart from suffering losses, he gained nothing. Chen Yi then realized Wang Yaowu's prowess and believed that Shandong had indeed reached a "head-on collision" situation. Chen Yi, a Communist army commander whose highest guiding principle for combat was "not attacking fortified positions," naturally retreated in the face of difficulty.</p>
<p>In late June, the 54th Army landed in Qingdao, and the 72nd Army was transported by air to Jinan. From the beginning of July, Commander Wang was ordered to begin a self-defensive counterattack. He used his original three armies plus these two armies, a total of five armies, with the most flexible and ingenious deployment, making the Shandong Communist army feel like they were in a fog, not knowing that he had thousands of troops. Thus, he unfolded his grand strategy, opening up the 394-kilometer Jiaoji Railway from the isolated strongholds of Jinan, Qingdao, and Changyi within 100 days (before the Double Tenth Festival). The railway bureau also stepped up repairs, completing the miracle of opening the entire line to traffic on December 16.</p>
<p>Brilliant Achievements; Explicit Order Concurrently in Charge of Shandong Administration</p>
<p>On October 22nd, when Commander Wang was supervising the troops in Weixian and advancing into Yexian, the Executive Yuan passed his concurrent appointment as the Chairman of Shandong Province, succeeding He Siyuan. Commander Wang had no knowledge of this beforehand. On the 25th, he returned to Jinan from Weixian, and on November 1st, he officially held the inauguration ceremony. At the end of the same month, he went to Beijing to report on his work and seek instructions on the reorganization of the provincial government. As a result, Wang Yaowu did not recommend a single private individual to the reorganized Shandong Provincial Government. The Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Liu Xiang, the original Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, was introduced by Chief of Staff Chen. The Director of the Finance Department was recommended by the Ministry of Finance. The Directors of the Education and Reconstruction Departments were not changed. Even the position of Secretary-General was reassigned to Liu Daoyuan, the former Director of Civil Affairs, who had no connections with him. Not only that, but the first move of an ordinary provincial chairman would be to place a private individual in the most practical and inconspicuous position of the provincial financial institution, such as the General Manager of the Provincial Bank, but Wang did not change even this most basic point. On the first day of his inauguration, the three major goals of his administration were: (1) Talentism, (2) Selflessness for the Public Good, (3) Using the spirit of "Knowing and Acting Immediately, Bearing Hardship and Resentment, Achieving Oneself and Others, and Finishing What is Started" as the guiding principle for administration.</p>
<p>Clear and Decisive Style; Officers and Soldiers United and Simple</p>
<p>His original command had people from all provinces, but Shandong people were few, and Hunan people were the most numerous. This was in stark contrast to the style of former Chairman He, who emphasized local factionalism, the so-called "Cao Family Gang" (He was from Caozhou, i.e., Heze County) and "Four Central, North, and Columbia" (He's academic qualifications). Because Wang himself was also from Shandong, Shandong people always hoped that he would use more local people. Thus, one time, a local elder asked him, "Why are you using so many Hunan people?" Wang smiled and replied, "As long as Shandong people are capable, I will use them just the same."</p>
<p>Commander Wang does not love money. Not loving money does not mean that he does not want money. He still wants the money that should be wanted from above. He said that without money, things cannot be done. But every penny he asks for must be used on his subordinates and on the cause. Usually, the surplus of ordinary troops is the natural possession of a few high-ranking officers, but Wang Yaowu used this money as a public accumulation fund for the troops or institutions, used to run children's schools, veterans' schools, and veterans' factories, used as special rewards for subordinates during the New Year and festivals, and subsidies for poor and sick subordinates.</p>
<p>Commander Wang gives people the impression of being clear, sincere, and courteous. His personal life is simple, unadorned, and serious. He has no hobbies and often spends his spare time walking and reading. He hates corruption the most. When he first arrived in Jinan, it was when the takeover personnel were busy "robbing and taking over," but he strictly ordered his subordinates not to participate. His handling of everything emphasizes practicality. For work, he is especially good at managing time. Every day, from morning to night, he always has something to do and can arrange the urgency and priority of things very well. Since taking over the administration of the province, he has changed to governing in the morning and managing the military in the afternoon. He likes to ask questions and learn. There are many experts and scholars among his staff, who are always available for him to consult and ask for advice. His subordinates, infected and influenced by him, all have the same style as Wang. Not to mention the middle and lower levels, even at the high level: in the military, from Luo Xingli, Zhao Ruhan, Wu Yuan, Long Chuyun, Qian Baiying to Li Kunzhi; in the civilian field, from Liu Xiang, Zheng Xiran, and Fan Qijun to Liu Maohua, they all give the same impression of being warm, sincere, and courteous, without any bureaucratic style, living a simple and serious life, without any decadent atmosphere, working diligently and practically, without any procrastination. Over time, this style naturally becomes a trend. This trend is unprecedented in the large and small institutions in half of China that the reporter has come into contact with in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Three-Year Program; Laying the Foundation for Democracy</p>
<p>Regarding Wang Yaowu's political achievements in Shandong, because the military situation has not yet fully unfolded, it seems too early to talk about performance. However, the three-year administrative program of the Shandong Provincial Government promulgated by Wang on New Year's Day this year not only laid the democratic foundation of Shandong in politics but also laid the democratic foundation of Shandong in economy at the same time. Article 22 in the outline: "Resolve land disputes, protect tenant farmers, support owner-farmers, earnestly implement rent reduction measures, and realize land to the tiller," is the most powerful example.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the administrative program, Wang Yaowu also convened a Shandong Provincial Pacification Zone Political Affairs Conference on January 8th and 9th of this year. All responsible persons at the county level and above from the Party, government, military, and groups attended. The conference made concrete and detailed decisions on how to carry out pacification work in the future and how to compete with the Communist Party in politics. Because it has not yet reached the time when it can be published, it cannot be introduced in detail here. But one thing is worth mentioning is that at this conference, the past method of dividing county-level units into five levels based on population, tax revenue, etc., was abolished, and it was re-divided into the following five levels, namely (1) Controlled Areas, (2) Semi-Controlled Areas, (3) Stronghold Areas, (4) Mobile Areas, (5) Occupied Areas. All local administrative personnel, except those trained in the provincial cadre training corps, are not allowed to stay in the safe areas near Jinan, as in the past, waiting to come to the provincial government to collect their salaries, but must go to their work posts to carry out their work. This is the only way to coordinate with the military. In order to implement and carry out this resolution, in the past two months, one commissioner and four county magistrates have gloriously sacrificed their lives.</p>
<h3>"The Cattle and Horses of Shandong People Eat Grass and Squeeze Out Milk"</h3>
<p>From the 20th of the previous month, the great battle in central Shandong broke out. Due to an error in decision-making on the part of someone, the estimation of the Communist army's strength was too low, and the commanders of the troops were too careless and lacked vigilance. A coincidence of various factors allowed the Communist army to gain some small advantages in central Shandong. In order to preserve their strength, the National Army, in addition to ensuring the three strategic points of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang, had to make a strategic retreat on most of the Jiaoji Railway. The 24 counties and cities on the Jiaoji Railway that Commander Wang had worked so hard to manage for a year were only left with eight counties and cities. Although this responsibility was not actually Commander Wang's, Commander Wang still recorded it in his own account. Conversely, he did not take credit for his brilliant measures to ensure Jinan! When the situation in central Shandong was tense, Jinan was actually just an empty city plan. But Chen Yi, based on Commander Wang's prestige and past lessons, although his large army on the north, south, and west sides had all reached within about 20 kilometers of Jinan, he had to wait until the Communist army in Zibo had digested Commander Wang's only remaining capital, the 12th Army and part of the 96th Army, before daring to attack frontally. It was also under Chen Yi's excessive caution that Commander Wang, with a preemptive and decisive attitude (at this time, because he was facing the most critical moment, he could no longer and had no time to ask for instructions from above), withdrew all the troops in the Zibo and Zhangdian area to the periphery of Jinan within 24 hours. In this way, he not only preserved the 12th Army and the 96th Army but also stabilized Jinan. Chen Yi found nothing in Zibo and then realized that he had been fooled, but it was too late. He could only watch the city of Jinan lying at the foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain and comfort himself by saying, "'Head-on collision' has arrived again!"</p>
<p>Although the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be completely opened up in a very short period of time, the cleansing of the overall situation in Shandong still seems to have a relatively distant distance. Although opening up the Xuzhou-Jinan section can temporarily allow the people confined in Jinan to breathe some fresh air, most of the people in the entire province are still in dire straits. If the overall situation in Shandong is not cleared up for a day, and if the people of Shandong are not truly liberated for a day, Commander Wang will not be able to sleep soundly for a day. Commander Wang usually sleeps only five hours a night, and only four hours when the war is tense. Even these few hours are often disturbed by the telephone. He personally has no extravagant enjoyment. When there are guests, it is four dishes and one soup. When there are no guests, it is only one dish and one soup. Therefore, he often says when he speaks, "I came to Shandong to be a cattle and horse for the 38 million people, not to be a bureaucrat." Under his sincere inspiration and hard work, the people of Shandong also said in unison, "Wang Yaowu is indeed the cattle and horse of the Shandong people. The cattle and horse work all day long, eat grass, but squeeze out milk."</p>

<h3>Dehui After the Disaster</h3>
<p>— 16th Dispatch</p>
<p>On February 21, the Communist army began to launch 200,000 troops, taking advantage of the unfrozen ice, to cross the river and invade, attempting to control the stronghold and threaten Jilin and Changchun. Therefore, they attacked with four divisions of troops, and then with four infantry regiments, two artillery regiments, and eleven tanks, and more than 80 mountain and field guns of "75" and "88" caliber, launching a fierce attack.</p>
<p>The reporter's truck passed through the periphery of Changchun and went straight to Mishazi, which is a powerful stronghold connecting to Changchun. The Communist army had also passed through here once. Mishazi Station and all the buildings around Mishazi Station were burned down by the Communist army. According to the local people, the Communist army only stayed here for one or two days, but burned down 400 houses and pulled away fifteen trains of soybeans. Along the way from Mishazi, all the railway tracks were torn up and the utility poles were mostly cut off. From Lao Jia to Xi Hai, about seventy li, the railways and utility lines were almost completely destroyed. Their destruction technique is truly amazing. They turned the rails on the original roadbed upside down, the sleepers facing up, and falling to the side. In addition, there were also some sleepers burned, and all large and small bridges were blown up, about seven of them. Hala Ha also suffered the same fate, fifteen trains of soybeans were pulled away, and more than five hundred houses were burned down.</p>
<p>In this battle, the Communist army occupied the villages around Dehui and set up artillery positions, intending to turn Dehui into scorched earth and launch a so-called spring offensive, but this attempt has already become a bubble.</p>

<h3>On Writing Book Reviews</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Recently, when I've been with friends, we often discuss the question of "how to write book reviews." We demand the flourishing of the publishing industry, so we must demand that excellent book reviewers write good book reviews for readers. There are no fixed rules in writing, which everyone knows, so how could writing book reviews be an exception? Generally, a good book review must reach the point of fulfilling the task of a book reviewer. Therefore, judging the quality of a book review depends on whether that review can fulfill the duties that a book reviewer should perform.</p>
<p>Some say that a literary person must have the ability to fully express their thoughts, and a scientist must clearly organize the systematic problems or conclusions of their research in their works, but a book reviewer does not need to have such cultivation. This view is indeed incorrect. Literary criticism is about life, while literary book reviews are about criticizing literature, one being a direct criticism of life, and the other being an indirect criticism of life. Literary book reviewers often express the author's personality in the work, which is no different from literary creators expressing the personality of characters in their works. As for the main task of scientists is to reveal the truth and provide accurate knowledge, while scientific book reviewers are to criticize the truth revealed and the knowledge provided by the original author, one being a direct revelation of truth and provision of knowledge, and the other being an indirect revelation of truth and provision of knowledge. Scientific book reviewers often make a general introduction to the truth revealed and the knowledge provided by the original author, which is no different from scientists writing about the truth and knowledge they have gained from their research. A true literary book review can also be called a form of literary creation on the other hand. A true scientific book review can also be called a scientific work on the other hand. Literary book reviews were initially used as a tool for studying literature, but later became not only limited to being a tool but also a form of literary work. Scientific book reviews were initially used as a tool for studying science, but later became not only limited to being a tool but also a form of publishing scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Whether a literary book reviewer or a scientific book reviewer, they themselves should be a good reader. To make oneself a good reader, one must have the ability to read, understand the content and value, and seek conclusions. However, one cannot harbor any prejudice and should regard criticism as a tentative, objective, and relative conclusion, and should never force readers to believe with subjective thoughts. To write good book reviews, one must first thoroughly understand the author of the original book and their thoughts, and recognize one's own research and discussion as a continuous process of progress. Book reviewers should adhere to the correct level of commentary, provide their opinions on a certain book, and use it to encourage others to read the original book.</p>
<p>A clear and keen eye for appreciation is what book reviewers should also possess. Especially for literary criticism, one must fully express the ability to appreciate art. Brook said: "Literary critics should immerse their entire heart in the author's heart and truly achieve the point where they can appreciate the work, and must not fail to understand the author's thoughts and the essence of their work." In modern literary criticism, there is a type of appreciation criticism, which focuses on striving to understand and savor the nature, achievements, and value of the work, not subject to ethical or instructive restrictions, and far from the perspective of actual interests. An excellent book reviewer must undergo a certain amount of artistic cultivation in addition to scientific methods and philosophical spirit. Needless to say, literary works should be studied with an appreciative attitude, and even the discovery of certain scientific masterpieces must be approached with an appreciative attitude.</p>
<p>American writer Leo Markun said: "The person who writes book reviews should use all their heart and soul, including their humor, memory, and imagination." It can be seen that a good book review must be written naturally and clearly, otherwise it will make readers feel dull and boring. Markun also strongly warned against the "formulaic" nature of book reviews. Indeed, those book reviews we often see are extremely boring, always with that same set of forms and styles, failing to arouse readers' interest. I think that any book review that can be written in a lively, fluent, fresh, and concise style will surely arouse readers' interest. Remember: a good book review is itself a good article, and it has a unique value in itself. Book reviewers must not ignore this point.</p>

<p>B. General Review</p>
<p>(1) The number of books in the General Category is small, and there are no major original works, such as encyclopedias or dictionaries, published in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(2) In the Ethics category of Philosophy and Science, there is a lack of writings on children's life guidance.</p>
<p>(3) In the Educational Science category, there is not a single reference book for university professors, primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, or home teachers. Whether to be a teacher is another matter. As a teacher, and as a teacher in a world power, what kind of mind, what kind of conscience, what kind of mouth, and what kind of hands should this teacher have? It seems necessary to ask experienced teachers to write something out for us to repent. However, a quarter of the eighty-seven educational science books are rules for ball games.</p>
<p>(4) Although the number of works in social science this year is less than that of literature, the number of writers is several times that of literature. There are no detailed works on financial management and public finance this year, which seems to be quite necessary considering the national conditions.</p>
<p>(5) In terms of artistic works, there are no special books on sculpture, architecture, printing, etc., and there is not a single relatively laborious work in music.</p>
<p>(6) Writings in natural science feel scarce. There is a lack of guidance books in astronomy, and no natural history books are published at all. The only book on botany is a translation. There are fifteen types of physics and chemistry, mostly for high school students, and none of them are related to national defense.</p>
<p>(7) Twenty-six types of medical books have been published in this juncture, which is not too little. There is no research on DDT. Once politics is slightly on track, the number of books on industry and small crafts will definitely increase greatly.</p>
<p>(8) There is a big difference between the number of English and Russian books, but from this, we can also see the nation's ...</p>
<p>(6) There is a lack of folk literature in the literature category. After this disaster, compatriots from the north, south, east, and west have been exchanging like shuttles. If life can be a little more stable, there will be leisure to write something out for the people to appreciate. Publishers often do not indicate the style of the book, which is related to business.</p>
<p>Ba Jin and Mao Dun are creative. However, it is unknown to the author whether they each have more than ten works in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China. In the above statistics, they each have a certain number, which seems to be that the publishers repeatedly take old books as new books to fool the public.</p>
<p>(10) There are a total of 188 books in the history and geography category, which cannot be considered small in terms of quantity and percentage. Chronicles and biographies of Chinese and Western great men have made contributions. The only thing missing is archeology books. There are considerable historical materials about this war being published, but unfortunately, most of them are copied from others, and there are no special books about how we resisted, how we moved west, and how we won.</p>
<p>C. Proportion of Publications</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the achievements of the publishers. The above 1,461 books are published by more than 80 bookstores. Among them, the most on track publishers are Commercial Press and Zhengzhong, with Commercial Press accounting for more than 11% of the total number of new books, ranking first.</p>
<p>Finally, the percentage of books in each subject is listed below as a conclusion:</p>
<p>General Books 28 Titles 2%</p>
<p>Philosophy and Science 92 Titles 6%</p>
<p>Education 87 Titles 5%</p>
<p>Social Science 343 Titles 23%</p>

<h3>On American Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>— Xinjun</p>
<p>Written by Lippmann, Translated by Luo Yinpu, Published by Da Shidai Bookstore</p>
<p>Today, the relationship between China and the United States is so close that American goods and troops can be encountered anytime, anywhere. However, although the relationship is so close, the general public's understanding of the United States is too lacking, or it can be said that most of the Chinese people do not recognize it clearly. As a Chinese person, this phenomenon is extremely shameful.</p>
<p>A country's foreign policy is its guiding principle for foreign relations, so to understand the United States, it is necessary to first understand its foreign policy. The American policy toward China in front of us certainly does not yet have a special book, and it is also quite difficult to see clearly. For its basic and normal foreign policy, an outline can be seen in this book.</p>
<p>This book is mainly for the American people and is known as the basic reading material for American foreign policy. In this book, Lippmann carefully and rigorously points out how the American people should establish a foreign policy that balances "strength" and "responsibility."</p>
<p>The author's plan is needed by the American people and even more hoped for by our people—it is very beneficial for us if the United States has an excellent and normal foreign policy.</p>
<p>The translator explains that Lippmann's proposition is "to form a core alliance after the war by Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China (if China becomes strong), and to gather other countries around this alliance to form a universal new international order. Under this order, all small and weak countries enjoy safety and freedom, and countries are free from causing conflicts..."</p>
<p>Such a new international order is not only hoped for by China, but also waited for by the people of the whole world!</p>
<p>Although the author still has many shortcomings in some places, the translator has pointed them out, so understanding its shortcomings and then reading this book, its value is still there.</p>
<p>The author himself explains: "My main argument is that the American foreign policy, which was generally sound for most of the nineteenth century, became dangerously unsound after 1900... My argument, as the reader will see, becomes a harsh criticism of American foreign policy during this period..."</p>
<p>Indeed, the author is standing from a critical standpoint to deal with his treatise.</p>
<p>In this treatise, the author first explains the purpose of the book, and then describes the basic principles of foreign policy. These two items tell the reader an understanding of his book and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Then, it broadly discusses: (1) America's "Foreign Responsibility"—America's continental border, the Western Hemisphere, the Pacific, the transition period of the new and old centuries; (2) The Bankruptcy of American Foreign Relations—The foreign policy of President Theodore Roosevelt, the foreign policy of Wilson, the collapse of American foreign policy, Roosevelt's position before the war; (3) Illusions—"Peace," "Disarmament," "Opposition to Entangling Alliances," "Collective Security"; (4) America's Position; (5) The Victorious Countries of the Atlantic Group, the British-American Connection, elements; (6) The Soviet Union and the United States—past, future, interests, and the relationship between the two countries in the Pacific; (7) China and the United States—the connection between China and the United States, the instability in East Asia; (8) A Universal International Order—the core alliance, and its reasons, conditions.</p>
<p>The author wrote the above eight items with his rich experience. After reading it, one can clearly understand the general outline of American foreign policy in the past.</p>
<h3>Late-Blooming Rose</h3>
<p>— Huran</p>
<p>Written by Storm, Translated by Ba Jin, Published by Wenhua Shenghuo She</p>
<p>Ba Jin selected and translated three novels written by Theodor Storm, using the medium-length novel called "Late-Blooming Rose" as the book title, and included it in one of the Culture and Life Series he edited himself. The other piece is "Malte and Her Clock", and the medium-length novel "Bee Lake". "Bee Lake" was translated by Guo Moruo many years ago, called "Inmeng Lake", and this novel is very popular among young readers.</p>
<p>I haven't read many of Storm's works before. However, in the few articles that have already been read, the impression he gives is Qingli and concise. He, unlike British and American writers, likes to make the scene tense and lively, or insert small, detailed descriptions. In terms of plot alone, it is also quite plain. In addition, his writing style is slow, which makes it feel the most relaxed when reading. However, it is also for this reason that his works lack the power to inspire life. Storm expresses this in "Late-Blooming Rose", which is a bit like the evening sun, reflecting on things in memory. Although beautiful, it is, after all, a falling glow, a kind of twilight melancholy, a kind of realization, often adding a new sorrow to the worried and sensitive heart.</p>
<p>In "Malte and Her Clock", he describes an old maid who lives alone in her small house. There is no one to accompany her except for a "talking" clock and some old furniture. Malte spends a long time in this cloak. She did not feel lonely or bored. He was kind and faithful, and loved the relatives and tenants he knew. However, until one Christmas night, she suddenly felt different. In the clock sound of answering, she recalled the things she had experienced in her life, her sorrow, her little Guangle, some beautiful things suddenly poured into her already old mind, raising her head. She felt: "It was almost completely dark all around, and there was only a dim moonlight outside, lying on the snow. Apart from the sound of the clock, the house was as quiet as death. There were no children's songs in the small house, no frying sounds in the kitchen, only she was left in the house, and everyone else was gone." Malte was at a loss.</p>
<p>"Late-Blooming Rose" tells the story of a middle-aged man "trapped in a network of careers", mechanically passing his days, neglecting other things. Inadvertently, his young wife is gradually withering beside him, although she is still very gentle and harmonious. Until one day, on his birthday, he suddenly discovered that a gift his wife gave him was a profile of a girl; that is, a portrait of herself when she was young; that amazing coquettishness and precious youth made the rude husband feel guilty; he felt that he had neglected his wife. At this time, he realized that youth is short-lived, and the late-blooming rose only has a moment of beauty. He seemed to feel that he had lost something—because at the bottom of love, there was only the last bit of nectar left, it was already too late.</p>
<p>These two novels have no tortuous plots, and the structure is also very simple. When viewed as a group, it is often difficult to grasp the theme. People who like to watch stories really can't find stories here, but only in the afterthoughts can they appreciate what kind of atmosphere the author has arranged, containing What is the real meaning.</p>
<p>However, in "Bee Lake", we can see more moving pictures, detailed descriptions, and the arrangement is also very clear. At the beginning of the story, Reinhard is already very old. One night, in front of the bronze statue of his former lover, he relived the simplicity of his youth: when he was a child, he fell in love with the beautiful Elizabeth in his hometown; later, in order to seek further study, he went to the city to study, and during the two years, he also returned once, and Elizabeth was still his only companion; but shortly after he returned to the city, he also got the news of Elizabeth's engagement, she had agreed to Eric's request according to her mother's wishes, and Eric was Reinhard's good friend, he was honest and extremely rich, and the houses in the Bee Lake area were managed by him. A few years later, Reinhard passed through this beautiful land and met Eric. Eric was very happy and immediately invited him home, enthusiastically treating him as an honored guest. Of course, he would definitely meet the lover who would always fascinate and hurt him - Elizabeth has not changed from before, still light and soft, but unfortunately her heart has become dull and dull; in the few days of reunion, they also had a pleasant gathering; they sang folk songs together in the spring evening, and the green grass by the lake also left traces of walking; although there are no bayberries that can be found in the children's games, although Elizabeth has become someone else's wife, and although Reinhard can't write a single poem anymore; the indulgent gathering is still fragrant; they can be regarded as spending a short spring - before the seasons have changed, Reinhard had to leave the beautiful Bee Lake and return to his lonely journey.</p>
<p>Works like those written by Storm are difficult for ordinary readers to accept. Ba Jin mentioned in the "Postscript": "I don't want to introduce it to a wide audience, but for some tired souls, Da Qingli's writing style, simple structure, and pure emotions may bring a little comfort." In fact, it is indeed the case. Now that we introduce this small book to readers, it also has its own intentions; the choice of materials for creation does not allow us to stay in a small cage, pleasing the general idle class of readers with bizarre fantasies and flowery rhetoric, but we cannot erase the works that reveal true feelings with one stroke, thinking that they are boring, superficial, and unworthy. This world, despite being absurd, is still a "human" world. We need everything that is full of "human touch", and our emotions need more irrigation and growth in many aspects. A majestic chorus or symphony can bring about a surging tide of emotions, which can make people feel a big shock when they are in a coma; however, a serenade, a few low solos, has a unique value, often making people linger endlessly and contemplate repeatedly.</p>
<p>Life needs the tempering of fire; the soul needs the baptism of fire; but Storm's novels, which are similar to prose, are like a small stream, flowing past under your feet, will you hear it?</p>
<h3>Random Chats from Solitude</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>The habit of Shanghai citizens is to like going through the back door. The front door can be said to be a door that is set up but rarely opened. Someone might ask: "Why is this?" I say: "This is the so-called 'Rather flatter the King of Qin than the King of Chu.'" At this time and in this place, finding a gentleman who doesn't take shortcuts is indeed a difficult task.</p>
<p>Looking at going through the back door—what Qu Yuan called "the narrow path of expediency"—one can extrapolate to larger political aspects.</p>
<p>If we examine history, many upheavals have originated from eunuchs and relatives of the emperor. This has been the case since ancient times.</p>
<p>The Analects record Ji Kangzi asking Confucius about governance:</p>
<p>"If one were to kill the wicked to promote the virtuous, what would you say?" The question was asked very straightforwardly. If it were Zhang Xianzhong, he would definitely say directly: "Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p>
<p>But Confucius, who constantly spoke of the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean, put on the face of a schoolteacher and said: "If you desire good, the people will be good. The virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, the virtue of a commoner is like grass; when the wind blows over the grass, it will surely bend."</p>
<p>This argument seems progressive, as if the social atmosphere depends on the political system.</p>
<p>However, when Confucius reached the end of the Investiture of the Gods, he couldn't help but chant in a low voice: "Confucius is about to start killing." So, within a few days of taking office, he killed his political opponent, Shaozheng Mao. Confucius' virtue was not like the wind over the grass.</p>
<p>Naturally, righteous gentlemen would explain it as "acting on behalf of Heaven."</p>
<p>Can a small apricot-yellow banner completely cover up Song Jiang's "benevolent and righteous" cunning?</p>
<p>I'm afraid it's like the story of Queen Victoria of England, if my memory serves me correctly. Niu told me this way.</p>
<p>The wise Queen, because she was diligent in politics, only returned to her bedroom late at night. Her husband, a certain prince, was already asleep, and the bedroom door was also closed.</p>
<p>The sound of knocking on the door—</p>
<p>"Who's there?" the prince asked from the bed.</p>
<p>"Her Majesty the Queen!" the Queen answered from outside the door.</p>
<p>The prince turned over impatiently and started sleeping again. After waiting for a while, the Queen knocked on the door again—</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Her Majesty the Queen!"</p>
<p>Both voices were louder.</p>
<p>"I'm asking who you are?" Annoyance filled his tone.</p>
<p>The clever Queen suddenly used her light and gentle voice to say:</p>
<p>"Me? Your wife."</p>
<p>Then, the door opened quickly. The prince embraced this wise ruler of the generation and said forcefully: "I am unwilling to open the bedroom for anyone at this late hour; if I do, it is only for my wife."</p>
<p>I can't help but think of the story in Romance of the Three Kingdoms:</p>
<p>It seems that when Liu Bei sought an audience with Sima Hui, he recited a long list of official titles to the young gatekeeper. Unfortunately, this young gatekeeper did not have the cultivation of an official. He was just loyal and said indifferently: "Sir! I can't remember such a long and rambling list."</p>
<p>With just this one sentence, the young gatekeeper was wiser than this peerless hero.</p>
<p>Those lords who only know themselves and not others, who look in the mirror all day long, should not proudly recite their high positions and generous salaries to the suffering people.</p>

<h3>World Professional Women's Day – A Record of their "March 18th" Celebration</h3>
<p>— Hei Xing</p>
<p>This was a magnificent gathering. Due to the splendid and dazzling lights, and the elegant, aristocratic attire of the noble ladies and misses, I sensed the luxurious and graceful atmosphere that should be present in the salon of aristocratic women.</p>
<p>I am not exaggerating excessively about that aristocratic-style evening party; they had all received a good education and had a good social standing. Most of them could speak fluent English and wore decorations that were not too flashy but extremely elegant. They included women of nearly ten nationalities—there were British, American, German, Russian, and, of course, mostly Chinese. Using an international language, they spoke of peace and of maintaining Sino-American friendship.</p>
<p>Laughter filled the entire auditorium. The colors of the clothing and the beauty of the hair, in this kind of international gathering where high-class women purely express their education and thoughts, revealed their graceful and beautiful figures.</p>
<p>They immersed themselves in the sweet and joyful atmosphere of this annual "World Professional Women's 20th Anniversary Celebration." Some people prepared songs and dances, and some prepared their long speeches.</p>
<p>These are all things that require a long period of education to be able to show one's talent.</p>
<p>As a reporter, I sat behind their seats. These women of various nationalities, beneath their light furs and heavy makeup, were all extremely elegant and wealthy.</p>
<p>Male guests were extremely rare. I only saw an American military photographer, two or three Chinese police officers, and a few laborers and servants. They all stood by the wall, without seats.</p>
<p>The memorial ceremony that day began with a dinner, followed by speeches. The chairman was Dr. Ma Yueqing, and there were about two speakers, Dr. Ma Zhu Juefang and Mrs. Bai Yuehan.</p>
<p>There were several entertainment segments, including a chorus of "The Mountain is in the Vague Distance," Miss Yang Xiaoyan's dance, Miss Qi En Geng's solo, Miss Zhang Renqing's solo, and so on.</p>
<p>A list of the classifications of professional women who attended that day is attached here: Customs had the most, with thirty-one people. The post office was second, with thirty people. Y.W.C.A. had twenty-nine people, banks had nine, musicians had eight, the Executive Yuan had seven, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) teachers, the United States Information Service, and nurses all had five people, oil companies had four people, import and export firms had four people, the Central Trust of China had two people, the Young Women's Christian Association had two people, and doctors and accountants each had two people, the water company had two people, and more than ten other people.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that World Professional Women's Day is March 18th, and the professional women of Shanghai usually hold a celebration. This year's venue was the Bank of China Building.</p>
<p>It is hoped that future Professional Women's Days will be able to more broadly absorb women from all walks of life and allow them to speak out about their inner pain and difficulties in life, and that they can receive practical help.</p>
<p>Only then can this conference truly be in-depth and universal, and also contribute to mutual understanding and the establishment of world peace.</p>
<h3>Drinking Fire Order</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Fire City</p>
<p>Formerly called Foreign City, today transformed into Fire City, the sound of alarm bells is heard from time to time, the more housing is scarce, the more disasters occur!</p>
<p>The stench of charred corpses is everywhere, every household is frightened, continuous disasters have ruined myriad homes? The poorer you are, the more merciless it is; the more broken the fire equipment, the more powerful the god of fire!</p>
<h3>In Memory of Grand Master Taixu</h3>
<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>Grand Master Taixu, whose ancestral home was Chongde, Zhejiang, with the surname Lü in secular life, understood the Four Emptinesses in his youth and took refuge in expounding Buddhism. As he grew older, he developed a spiritual connection, diligently studied the Vinaya, and researched the teachings and views of the Tiantai and Huayan schools, achieving profound mastery. Subsequently, he traveled around the world, traversing the globe. He had just arrived from Yin County at the beginning of the month and suffered another stroke on the 12th. After all medical treatments failed, he passed away at one hour and fifteen minutes in the afternoon of the 17th, at the age of fifty-nine.</p>
<p>The Grand Master was an eminent monk of the present age. In addition to Buddhist studies, he was also proficient in Western philosophy and literature. With insightful vision and foresight, he pioneered the great and lofty ideas of reforming Buddhism and religious friendship, and his writings numbered over a hundred.</p>
<p>The Grand Master cultivated himself with a breadth like the sea, possessing kindness and gentleness. The pine breeze and water moon were insufficient to compare to his purity. He devoted himself to learning all day long, meditating and returning to emptiness, transcending the world. He was truly a living Buddha of this age.</p>
<p>The Grand Master propagated the doctrines and teachings throughout the country and abroad. In his life, he had traveled to Japan, the United States, England, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, India, Myanmar, and other countries. Wherever he traveled, various universities invited him to lecture, and newspapers and magazines competed to publish his words and deeds. He was the first person to transmit Chinese Buddhism to Europe and the United States. Moreover, he had extensively propagated the Dharma and transformed beings in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Tibet, with disciples throughout the world, both Chinese and Western. Contemporary scholars and famous figures such as Kang Youwei, Zhang Taiyan, Zhang Jian, Wang Yiting, Zou Haibin, Grand Master Yinguang, Grand Master Panchen, Zhang Yiceng, Li Genyuan, Dai Chuanxian, Liang Hancao, Yu Bin, Tagore, Gandhi, Nehru, and others often associated with him.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang and the Grand Master were friends of transcendence, and their friendship was deep. Amidst his myriad tasks, they had mutual exchanges, discussing learning and studying scriptures, enjoying their conversations, and occasionally sharing vegetarian meals, accompanying each other on mountain and river tours, discussing the world and the nation's affairs intimately. In the 17th year of the Republic [1928], he followed Chairman Jiang's invitation to Beijing to lecture on Buddhism, which was well-received by the government and the public. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he moved with the government, calling on Buddhist youth to rise up and protect the country. He also formed the Buddhist International Visiting Delegation to promote the central government's policies of resistance and nation-building, gaining praise and sympathy from the Allied nations. Furthermore, he used Buddhist power to transform border residents to be inward-looking. On New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], the National Government awarded him the Victory Medal as the leader of religious figures.</p>
<p>The Grand Master was currently the President of the Paris World Buddhist Academy, a Director of the Chinese Buddhist Association, the President of the Shanghai Buddhist Academy, a Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Buddhist Association's Rectification Committee, and the President of the Sound of the Sea Tide Monthly Magazine. Throughout his life, he presided over famous mountains and monasteries, and the Buddhist academies he founded in various places were also famous far and wide. His outstanding disciples, such as Dharma Master Daxing, Dharma Master Zhifeng, and Dharma Master Fushan, were all well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning, with excellent insights.</p>
<p>Now that the Grand Master has returned to the Western Paradise, his legacy will last forever. The Buddhist community has lost a teacher, and the academic community has lost a master. I am deeply saddened by the Grand Master's passing, but the world's admiration for him is a cause for celebration for China.</p>
<h3>Confession of a Coolie</h3>
<p>— Yang Si</p>
<p>The High Court re-examined the case of coolies sent to Japan killing their companions. According to reports, the defendant and witnesses described the cruel treatment they suffered at the hands of the Japanese. As the defendant's lawyer said, it was a vivid picture, good material for a film, and good evidence for judging the crimes of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The defendant said that he "was transported by the Japanese to Kagoshima, Japan, to work as a coolie, leading twenty-three companions. Each person only had seven ounces of rice to eat each day, and there was no rice, mostly bean cakes, potato skins, and other miscellaneous things. Also, because the North Sea was extremely cold, with snow more than two feet thick, the companions all slept in tattered cotton and straw. Under these conditions of hunger and cold, five or six out of ten companions died."</p>
<p>One witness said: "The coolies in Japan had to scramble to eat the fish bones and meat bones left over by the Japanese. The coolies could not bear the abuse of the Japanese, so there was no reason for them to beat each other."</p>
<p>Just reading these two paragraphs is enough to make one's heart feel heavy. In the distant North, so many compatriots were working as coolies under the whips of the Japanese. Hunger and cold caused them to die one after another. The cruelty was worse than in the battlefield. They were silently dragged away and silently died. Fortunately, those who survived were sent back without a word of complaint. They will eventually take this unexpected suffering and sleep peacefully underground, as ignorant Chinese people. In this chaotic world, their suffering is neither known nor recognized.</p>
<p>However, suffering did not make them numb. On the contrary, they have gained considerable awareness. The words of that witness are knowledgeable, and broadly speaking, they are also a fact.</p>
<p>It is a pity that "those with the same illness do not sympathize with each other." Regardless of whether the defendant killed his compatriots under the oppression of the Japanese, it is true that he was accused by his companions after returning. This fact can also be viewed broadly, and it is enough to make one's heart feel heavy.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Circles</h3>
<p>— Feng Qian</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the writer Li Liewen resigned from his position as the president of the Fujian Reform Publishing House and went to Taiwan to serve as the deputy editor of the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily. In the autumn of last year, he was dismissed by Chen Yi for some reason, and lived in leisure in Taipei, focusing on translating foreign literary works. During the "February 28th" incident, he suffered from false alarms, but fortunately was not injured.</p>
<p>The Japanese novel "Newspaper Seller" by Yang Da, which exposes the Japanese oppression of the Taiwanese people, has been translated into Chinese by Hu Feng. Recently, a Chinese-Japanese bilingual edition has been printed in Taiwan, which is very popular among readers and has been reprinted three times.</p>
<p>Taiwanese writers mostly write in Japanese due to educational reasons. After the victory, a Japanese-language novel was published, "Ho Chi Minh" by Zhang Luoyin, which describes the distress of a Taiwanese youth who was educated in Japan and turned to the embrace of the motherland. It is aimed at the current problems of Taiwanese youth. Others, such as "A Taiwanese Youth's Last Cry" (the author's name has been forgotten), are angry accusations against the current situation in Taiwan, which have been well received by readers in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Cultural groups organized by Taiwanese writers and cultural figures include the "Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association," which is located in the Taipei Zhongshan Hall and publishes a monthly magazine called "Taiwan Culture." The association is abbreviated as "Taiwan Wenxie."</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Mysterious Lady."</h3>
<p>This film will soon be released at the Cathay Theatre. The entire film depicts the scandalous and secret life of a beautiful woman.</p>
<h3>Record of a Dangerous City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"I'll do as you say!" Xu Shaoming tapped the bowl a few times with his chopsticks. "I'll tell Ah Shi to get it right away! Please sit down, let's talk more!"</p>
<p>Old Zhu nodded, still sat down, and while Xu Shaoming was talking to Ah Shi, he turned back to smile at Lan again; Lan shook her head at him, her expression not very happy, as if she very much disapproved of him using this method on Old Xu. Of course, he couldn't tell her immediately that he was just teasing Old Xu, he could only smile at her again.</p>
<p>"But, Old Zhu, you can't joke with me," Fatty Xu was not without vigilance. "If Jin Aili doesn't come tonight, and my check bounces tomorrow, don't blame me!"</p>
<p>In fact, Zhu Zhaonian had already been confident.</p>
<p>"Okay! But, you have to pay attention," he tapped the table twice with his hand. "Tonight I can only accompany her to talk to you for a while. When to let her come live with you here, it's better for you to decide for yourselves!"</p>
<p>Fatty Xu was overjoyed and immediately drank another big gulp of Moutai; then Ah Shi brought in a book of Bank of Communications checks, Zhu Zhaonian immediately snatched it into his hand, and took out his own pen, handing it to Fatty Xu, urging him like he was pressing for debt to sign a check for 450,000 yuan. In the middle, he couldn't avoid several rounds of bargaining.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, take it!" Finally, the fat man handed the check to Old Zhu, saying regretfully: "It's just that you are not as good as Old Zhong in this point! He's also a good friend of mine, but he never advises me to spend this kind of unseemly money!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, you are absolutely right!" Old Zhu hid the check, saying nonchalantly: "That's why Old Zhong can also open movie theaters and be a boss just like you."</p>
<p>"Old Zhong has really made some money in recent years. Hahaha! Who's like you, a fool?" Xu Shaoming smiled so that his eyes narrowed into a line, and at the same time quickly picked up his wine glass and drank a big gulp. After all, four or five hundred thousand yuan was a small matter for him, and once the check was handed out, his heart no longer ached.</p>
<p>Now, Zhu Zhaonian's thoughts were very chaotic. Although the donation matter had been satisfactorily resolved, the preparations for the retreat of all the staff of the theater troupe had not yet begun, and his sudden reunion with Lan in a different place at this time had added a big problem to him; also, how Jin Aili should be settled was also quite thorny for him.
