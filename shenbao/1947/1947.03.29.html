<h3>中樞紀念革命烈　主席發表告青年書　勉獻身報國謀統一安定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕中樞為紀念國民革命先烈紀念日及靑年節，定廿九日上午九時在國府舉行紀念典禮，蔣主席主持，十一時起在靈谷寺致祭，在京中委及黨，機關人員，陸海空軍人員均將參加。下午七時至十時，京支團部及政大舉辦世界靑年敎育晚會，參加者有十四國靑年代表。又靑年團京支團部於廿九日午舉辦春季旅行，以湯山為目的地。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕廿九日為第四屆靑年節，蔣主席發表告全國靑年書，原文如下：　今天是黃花崗七十二烈士殉國紀念日，亦就是為求得中華民族之平等自由，為完成中華民國之統一獨立，為實現民有。民治。民享之三民主義而奮鬥，而犧性的革命紀念節。七十二烈士的慷慨赴義，奮勇成仁，實為我中華民族建立永久不滅之光熒，更為我中華民國創造萬世不拔之基礎。我們為紀念先烈，策勵靑年，所以在四年以前，特定今天為中國靑年節，全國愛國靑年子弟們，大家臨此光熒紀念日，應如何景仰革命先烈，愛護革命歷史，共同一致，積極努力，使我先烈所創造的中華民國及其所復興的中華民族發揚光大，庶幾不悚為我國父革命的信徒，以慰我革命先烈的英靈。今年的靑年節，正是我們民主憲法頭布以後，統一工作積極推進的時候，我們靑年自然更要鼓舞奮發，來紀念革命先烈奮鬥光榮的史績，勉為我們中華民國建國的幹部。但是省察國內的現勢，這一年來國家統一備受被壞，人民生活倍感痛苦，我相信我們有血性，有志節的革命靑年，又必以沉痛的心情來紀念這一個令節，我們常說「先烈之血，革命之花」，回憶我們靑年節創始的一年，正是對日抗戰最激烈，而且最嚴重的一年，全國愛國靑年，繼承黃花碧血的芬芳，效法先烈獻身報國的奮鬥，就在靑年節創始以後，即有十萬知織靑年從軍的壯舉，使世界對中國靑年刮目相看。後來，靑年軍在縝緬戰場上艱苦光榮的戰績，達成抗戰勝利的任務，說明了我們中國知識靑年的力量一經集合發揮，便可對國家作無限的貢獻，緊接着對日抗戰的勝利，我們國家最迫切的需要，為統一安完，為復員建國，這次大戰，是空前朱有的大規模戰爭，也是空前未有的殘酷戰爭，我們中國作戰的時間最長久受禍的程度最慘烈，其需要統一安定與復員建設，也最為殷切。我曾經設過，「要提高同胞的生活在於建設，要克服經濟的困難在於建設，要消弭失業的痛苦在於建設，要鞏固國家的基礎，保持勝利的光榮，也在於建設」，為了使得我們參後復員與建設得以順和推行，所以中央政府不惜竭盡全力來求取和平統一的基礎，不惜多方參曲求全，來促起製造分裂破壞統一者的覺悟。不幸一切和談都被共產黨拒絕，抗戰勝利以後一年半的種稱努力，都歸泡影，使得各地秩序日加紛亂，人民生活更為困苦，抗戰勝利的光熒，將為此而消失，國家民族獨立平等的地位，也因此受到莫大的影響，共產黨這種行為，破壞了國家的統一，阻礙了建設的進行，不僅為我革命先烈的罪人，且為我國家民族的蟊賊，我全國愛國靑年，在此局勢之下，要為國家，為民族而作有效的貢獻，就必須抉擇自身應處之道、</p>
<h3>堅持純潔立塲</h3>
<p>靑年報國的道路，固然不止一端，但是國家和人民最迫切的需要，在於建設，抗戰勝利後，我們最大的任務，即為建國，而建國的基礎，在於統一，沒有統一，則國家即不能進行建設，人民即不能安居樂業，國家民族更不能獲得平等自由的地位，所以今天我們靑年報國的要務，首先要努力造成統一的環境，所謂統一的環境，在秩序上必須是安定的，而不是紛亂的，在思想行動上，必需是積極的、而不是破壞的，我們在抗戰勝利後，國家獨立平等和尊嚴，還不能得到普遍的尊重，就是因為共產黨武裝叛亂，割據地盤，擾亂社會，殘害人民，破壞統一。因之，國家民族要蒙受了今日這樣的奇恥大辱，現在我們靑年要洗刷這個恥辱，決不是祇憑一時的感情衝動所能濟事，我們要針對「反統一一，，反建設」的力量而奮鬥，我們要以全力促成國家的統一，造成社會的安定，要堅特我們純潔的立場，要發揮我們愛國的德性，杜絕政治野心家利用學校，利用工廠作鬥爭的堪所，因之，我們必須為國家，為民族，尊重學術自由，維護社會秩序，增進國家生產，首先使我們自身成為獨立不搖的靑年，使我們的敎育機關造成眞正求學的良好環境，不因剌激而妄動，不為煽惑而盲從，學校是社會的表率，學校能够安定，乃可進而助成社會的安定，必定要有了這樣積極安定的力量，而後乃能建立統一的環境，必如此，我們國家方不致受人家的輕侮，我們建國纔可以順利進行，我們靑年乃有了就業報國的途徑。</p>
<p>其次，我們靑年要努力求學，作建設工作的充分準備。國父常說「立志做革命要有高深的學問做根本」，國父一生領導革命，其偉大的成就，無不是得力於高深的學問。今天我們國家需要的建設，眞是千端萬緒，範圍非常的廣大，現代各國科學技術工業的突飛猛晋，一日千里，我們無論在生產建設上講，在社會進步上講，都是瞠乎其後，我全國有志靑年，要知道論國恥這就是國恥的根源，論責任這就是靑年最大的責任，我們必須乘此靑年期間，急起直追，努力向學，求得了高深的學問，然後我們對國家建設纔　有眞正的貢獻。更要知道，尊師重道，是獲得學問實益的基礎者，而扶特良好的校風勿　時廠日，忽　佚矜張，又為同學之間切磋琢磨進德修業的根本，我們要不事負這一個偉大的時代，不自誤其極可寶貴的人生，必須有舍我其誰的氣概來作迎頭趕上的努力。</p>
<h3>認識時代責任明辦是非利害</h3>
<p>為自救救國而奮鬥</p>
<p>全國愛國的靑年子弟們，靑年是創造時代的先　，是國家民族的新生命，我們中國首先倡導革命的，自國父以次，如陸皓東。史堅如諸先烈，都是靑年，黃花崗七十二先烈，也多是靑年，辛亥革命，十五年北伐以及這次對日抗戰，其貢獻生命力量最多的，大多數也是靑年，中國靑年在歷史上已經寫下了光榮紀錄，足與我中華民族共埀不朽。現在抗戰雖已結束，而建國猶未成功，當前的時代是建設時代，國家需要你們去建設，需要你們在建設上去建立輝煌的功績，開創來日的光明，你們必須振作精神，積極奮鬥，萬不可隨俗浮沉，妄自菲薄，更要知道國家已進入民主憲政的初期，必定要保障學術的獨立，來繼護靑年求學良好的環境，所以你們更不可把你們大好的年華，豐富的精力耗費於徬徨煩悶的悲觀情緒與空煞無益的政治鬥爭，你們應當認識時代，認識責任，凡是擾亂社會，殘書人民的，就是我們國家的叛徒，凡是破壞統一，阻碍建設的，就是我們民族的敗類，誰搗亂我們的秩序，窒息我們的生機，使我們學生不得求學，農民不得耕種，工人不能做工，商人不能經商的，　就是我們全國人民的公敵。必須明辨是非，分析利害，要為國家担負責任，要為時代承常使命。我們　此光榮的紀念日，更應迫念革命先烈生死不渝的人格，效法革命先烈為國犧牲的精神，來改造建設的環境，扶植安定的力量，完成統一，効忠國家，這纔無負於我們創立靑年節的意義。全國靑年們，我們在國家如此紛亂殘破的環境之中，來舉行靑年節，我希望你們都能夠立定志顯，抱定決心，共同努力，為自救救國而奮鬥。</p>

<h3>國代選舉罷免法草案　立法院修正通過　邊地及僑民代表均增加</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕各方注意之國民大會代表選舉罷免法草案，經立院兩日討論後，已於廿八日例會完成立法程序，俟國府四月一日正式公布後，各地熱心憲政人士，即可進行競選準備。廿八日立院會義，仍由孫院長主持，僑務委長陳樹人亦列席說明，會中爭執最烈者，仍為代表名額分配間題，陳安仁，王泉笙等委員，對僑胞代表名額提出增加請求，廣錄，吳雲鵬等則為蒙古，西藏爭執席次，發言踴躍。鐘天心認邊地代表要求增加名額，係一稱好現象、應予支持，全院鼓　擁獲。結果西藏代表由卅名增至四十名，各民族在邊張地區選出者，由十名增至十七名，僑民代表由五十七名增至六十五名。討論選舉人與被選舉人資格時，若千立委認應將犯刑法內亂外患罪及曾服公務而有貧污行為判決確定者等款刪去，辯論殊烈，最後仍維持原案。關於候選人提名人數目限制，劉克備認有一百選舉人簽署即得提名，數目太少，簡貫三稱推一人為主席，以代替原定之監督灰委員員採制度。王師曾舉出三點理由，說明新辦法較原案為佳，（一）委員制不能與監督制並存，（二）若由內政部或民應主持，一切委諸幕僚，過於草率，（三）行憲　　協力進行，各方皆應有參與機會，表決採取委會制度。討論廿八條時，呂復認候選人依照法定　選名額，以得票比絞多數者依次當選易有徼倖情事，應仿效法國以觔所行辦法，遇不能獲得過半數情形時，舉行第二次選舉。狄膺，劉克儁僉認此事辦理不易，決議仍維原案。最棧討論罷免問題，對罷免盤請人數目及能免次數辯論亦烈，決議將「罷免案如經否決對於同一代表在原任期內不得再為罷免之聲明」一條刪去，全案於下午四時半討論竣事，並於全體肅立中，正式通過。（全文見明日本韜第八版）</p>

<h3>革命青年所負的時候責任　——迎青年節紀念黃花崗烈士</h3>
<p>今日為黃花崗七十二烈士舉義殉國紀念日，同時又為靑年節。往歲是日，各地均有隆重盛大的紀念會，對於革命先烈之殉國，深致其敬仰哀悼之誠；對於今日靑年之努力奮鬥，莫不寄予至大至遠的策勵。尤其是今年，當國家在抗戰勝利之後，向憲政建國的大道邁進之會，我們緬懷先烈的光熒成仁，對於我們此次抗拒暴日而獲得勝利，固然可以告慰先烈，然而盱衡國內外當前的局勢，却益足以增我們的警惕；是則本屆靑年節日的來臨，其意義尤為深長。</p>
<p>迥憶三十六年前的今日，正值淸政不總虛　肆虐之時，舉國人民方憔悴呻吟於異族統洽淫威之下，雖其前各地義士舉事達九次之多，不幸一一挫敗，天下惶惶。在此危亡之秋，賴各先烈抱定了不屈不撓的精神，殺身成仁捨身取義的決心，在孫總理偉大的領導下，於辛亥三月二十九日，發動圍攻廣州兩廣總署的義舉，以英勇旁礴的氣概，與淸吏作浴血搏戰，致林覺民等七十一烈士慷慨成仁。是役也，雖未能實現推翻淸廷的希望，但七十二烈士壯烈的犧牲，是偉大的：鮮紅的血開還了自由之花，革命的種子播到廣大的人民隊伍中，因而肇造了雙十革命成功的基礎。國民黨人三十年來的奮鬥，發動北伐，完成統一，抵拒侵略，實行抗戰，卒打倒日寇，都靠了這股革侖的活力。所以今日追悼革命先烈，必　　　取；先烈精神之所以振發國族，昭垂千古而不替者，此七十二位靑年英豪之具有革命的精神，革命的智慧，并且具有解放人民爭取獨立的革命目標，實為一種典型。辛亥雙十革命的成功，及其後北伐與抗戰的成功，又是此種革命精神，革命智慧的特續。所以今日的國民黨人，為國家努力建設，為新中國前程奮鬥，應該具有先烈的精神，隨時代而益新，纔能繼續滋長革命創造的活力，纔能繼續發揚黨的光輝，纔能荷負建國的重大責任。因之，今日紀念革命先烈，不僅要在形式上紀念，并且要在精神上追求，把先烈的革命精神和智慧，發揚光大起來。</p>
<p>靑年節之定於此日，確宣有重大的意義。第一，因為辛亥三月二十九日，七十二位靑年英豪的壯烈犧牲，是中國靑年為民族革命自由而發軔的一次偉人運動，其精神值得效法，其智慧值得學習。所以將「三·二九」作為責年節日的意義，實在深遠。再則，一九四二年十一月在倫敦舉行的國際靑年會議，為促進世界和平及世界靑年團結，選定了三月二十一日至二十八日為世界靑年週，中國為國際靑年會議的參加國，中國靑年為國際靑年的一員，所以中國靑年節定於三月二十九日，緊接着國際靑年週而發展，又具有世界的意義。今年的國際靑年週，為世界各國靑年的「和平週」，今日之前，各國靑年莫不為世界和平而宣勞，莫不為消滅侵略思想而奮鬥，莫不為人類幸福而努力。中國靑年不是孤立的，所以在今日紀念靑年節，我國靑年應認淸時代，應與國際青年的行動配合，應該爭取世界知平，反對侵略思想的再危害世界和平，同時，在國內為了和平，允須對憑藉武力，蓄意叛亂之徒，加以正義的聲討，這是革命靑年所負的時代任務，所負的對世界的任務。</p>
<p>中華民國三十六年的歷史，是一部飽經憂患的歷史。辛亥雙十革命前，中國靑年迭舉義旗，再番流血。民國肇建以後，中經二次革命之役，反對袁世凱之役，護法之役，以至十五年出師北伐之役，迄十七年始統一全國。常國家甫安定，內憂外息又復加緊，二十六年舉國奮起抗戰，至三十四年日寇始投降。勝利以後，政府正準備復員後的建設，期以竟七十二烈士未竟之志，不幸共黨復破壞統一，於是兵連禍結，民生凋敝，國無寗日。今天我們敬悼七十二烈士殉國紀念，同時迎接偉大的靑年節日，撫今思昔，深覺心情無限沉重；策往勵來，深覺責任無限重大。眼前的國家，需要和平統一的成功，需要民主意法的實施，需要人民生計得到保障，需要社會秩序得到安寗，是以今日和今日之後，我們靑年為了當起建國救國的大任，人人必須回復三十六年前革命黨人的心境與精神，起而維護國家的統一，努力於各種的建設，創造三民主義的新中國，必如是中華民國方有光明燦爛的前程，革命成績，方可長保，而黃花崗七十二烈士，乃眞為不死，亦必如是中國靑年方盡了時代的責任，七十二位靑年英豪寄予我們的事業，乃眞獲成功，願我們靑年其共勉之！</p>

<h3>莫斯科政治空氣陰沉　外長會議遭遇難關　馬歇爾否認將提前歸國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿八日電〕本星期杪對於莫斯科外長會議，具有決定的性質。各方面對於最後一期會議，期待股切。當前兩大難關，（一）關於奧境德國資產問題，（二）德國經濟的統一問題。關於前一問題之討論，巳於昨日形成僵局，將於今日恢復討論。除非今日能覓致解決辦法，則對奧和的之草擬，勢將延綏。以對德和的而論，調整委員會經澈夜工作後，其報吿書幾近完成，故外長會議至少可以涉及德國間題。各外長討論雖歷時半月，迄無解決之象，此種討論僅許將各種意見相比較，結果對於經濟統一事大相逕庭，會議之迫切危機是否可以避免，來日自見分曉。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科廿七日電〕觀察家頃以莫斯科街道上之行人，與四國外長會議相比較，謂莫斯科街道上之積雪業已開始融解，但在政治氣氛尙無春到人問之消息。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科廿八日廣播：在四外長會議中蘇聯方面己開始一種「討價還價」之妥協運動，其目的乃企圖自目前德國生產中獲得賠償，但英美仍堅特原來立堪。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕調整委員會終於今晨十時（格林威治時間）完成其分析此次會議各外長「同意」與「不同意」各點之工作。根據該委員會之最後起草書，截至目前為止，凡關於德國之經濟及政治之每一重要問題，各外長均未有協議。</p>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿七日合衆電〕馬歇爾之報界聯絡秘書，頃否認英廣播公司所傳馬歇爾定四月六日離蘇消息。按英廣播公司稱，馬歇爾曾吿貝文謂，渠定四月六日離蘇，惟馬卿之秘書否認此事。渠稱，法代表團定四月七日舉仃招待會，英代表國定九日舉行招待會，美代表團則繼英之後舉行招待會，刻各界揣測四月初外長會議可閉幕云。</p>
<h3>奧境德資產處置問題　四強起重大爭執　訓令外次會確立定義</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科廿八日廣播：莫洛托夫昨日在外長會議中對確立奧境德盜產問題之定義，曾提出修正案，據可靠消息，馬歇爾對此極表不滿，決予以拒絕。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿七日電〕蘇聯在今日之外長會議中仍要求有決定澳境德國資金定義之自由權，英美法三國要求由四强成立此等資金之定義，並設立適當之公斷機構，以便於發生爭執時實行公斷。皮杜爾並提出包含三點之決議案，但莫洛托夫又立即提出修正決議案，外長會議當於明日繼續討論奧境德國資金之問題。外長會議今日並議決拒絕南斯拉夫之聲請，不許其就特里埃斯特財政委會之報吿書向外長會陳述口頭意見，但准許義南二國提出書面意見醫，蘇聯此外並提出錯忘錄，宣佈決定一九四七年八月以前全部銷毀三强分配德國海軍協定中被列入「丙」類之德國軍艦。</p>
<p>奧境德國資金之定義，乃最棘手之問題，今日之辯論充分暴露蘇聯與其他三國觀點之不同。莫洛托夫表示，英美政府旣已宣佈放棄對奧國蘇聯區內德財產之要求權，則蘇聯當局自有自由處置此等財產之權。莫洛托夫復認英美法建議由四强規定具體定義，並於發生爭執時實行公斷之點為不必要。渠認祗須在保證管制此等財產之條約中，多加一款規定即可。馬歇爾强調聲明盟國之目的，在建立獨立的奧國，使其有適當之財產可以維特生存，員文亦謂，波茨坦會議從未議決被德國所竊之財產亦可供作賠款。皮杜爾所提之建議案，主張訓令外長代表（一）根據波茨坦決議，起草分配奧境德財產之條款，以列入奧國和的以內；（二）確立奧境德產之定義，凡因種族宗敎或政治原因被德國以武力奪取之吳國國民或聯合國國民之財產，不得包括在內；（三）根據奧和的草案第五十條起草公斷以解決爭執的條款。獎洛托夫表示願接受其由第一款，不能接受其中第三款，而對於第二款則主張修正如下：「外長代表應確立奧境德資金之定義，凡被德人以直接强暴行動奪取之財產，或未曾向奧國或聯合國國民給付補償而被征之財產，不得包括在內」。四强外長會議至此宣告延會，以審查莫洛托夫之修正案。</p>
<h3>奧斯汀在安理會解釋　美援助希土眞義　要求聯合國長期巡邏希北疆</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿八日電〕美代表奧斯汀本日在聯合國安全理事會發表演說，要求聯合國長期巡邏希臘北疆，並草擬援助希臘之遠大計劃。但在聯合國開始行動之前，美國有單獨援助希臘之必要。奧斯汀並稱：杜魯門總統要求國會撥款四億美元援助希土兩國以遏阻共產主義式之發展時，不僅包括希土兩國而已。但奧氏之演辭中，並未引用「共產主義」等字樣，亦未說明杜魯鬥語氣中之其他國家究係何國。奧氏續稱：美國擁護聯合國所右會員國有自己選擇政治制度之權利，但須有自由而不受威脅之選擇方法，且此等國家亦須不妨害別國之權利或自由。美國援助希臘之舉，加以聯合國之長期巡邏希臘北疆，必能促進和平之實現。美國渴望聯合國在受威脅地區採取有效行動，希望聯合國完成援助希臘之遠大計，但此種行動不能救目前燃眉之急。奧斯汀演辭對於土耳其部份甚為簡略，僅稱：在英國表示於三月底後不得不停止援助土耳其以前數月中，土國曾屢次要求美國給予經濟援助。美國在戰期內及大戰結束後會給予九千五百萬美元之租借物資，但以後則朱曾允許此項要求。杜魯門在國會演說時，曾謂必須在軍事上與經濟上同樣予以援助，以遏阻共產主義之統治希土兩國。但奧斯汀則僅引用「極權主義」，且從未引用「軍事」兩字。按杜魯門撥款四億美元援助希土兩國以遏阻共產主義之計劃，會引起許多聯合國外交家之不安，致使美國不得不有所解釋。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿七日屬〕美國代表奧斯汀將於星期六在安全理事會發表演說，闡明美國對希臘與土耳其問題之政策，演說長達三千言，原稿副本已於今日預先交蘇聯及安全理事會其他理事國參閱，可見其重要性。　〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿七日電〕消息靈通人士頃談稱：參議院外交委員會均贊成將美國援助希土兩國一項問題，提交聯合國機構討論。</p>
<h3>華萊士反對　軍事援助希土</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿七日電〕關於杜魯門總統援助希土二國一項計劃，「新共和國雜誌」主筆華萊士頃發表其主張稱：美國援助希土二國應在聯合國監督之下，以非軍事性質為限，對於希臘之援助，應屬救濟性質，並需該國澈底實行經濟與社會之改革。對於土耳其則不宜貸予借款云。衆議院領袖對此問題則認為參院所知美國外交政策之情形，較衆院為詳，故己決定先由參院加以定奪。參院外交委員會主席范登堡現正力促早取行動，聞最早或可於四月七日開始辯論云。</p>
<h3>蘇法秘密妥協說　法外部發言人予以否認</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿七日電〕法外部發言人否認法國與蘇聯在莫斯科有秘密約定之說，美謂外傳副總理代理外長泰特强昨會吿國民議會外委會之秘密會議，謂史達林向皮杜爾建議法蘇秘密約定，互相支持對德政策之說，並不確實。法蘇之問並無任何秘密約定之建議。按人民共和黨發言人昨日曾曰：泰特強曾吿外委會，據皮杜爾報吿，史達林建議由蘇聯支持法國對薩爾區之要求，以交換法國之支持蘇聯對德計劃，包括建立德國中央集權之政府，增加銅鐵產量以供賠償等。</p>
<h3>柏德遜告衆院外委會　蘇大軍雲集土邊　援助希土可避免戰爭</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕陸長柏德遜告正在討論社魯門總統援助希土計劃之衆院外交委員會稱：大量蘇聯軍隊，現在集於土國邊界，余個人以為援助希臘土耳其兩國，其所形成之趨勢，非偽向戰爭方面進展而為避免戰爭的發生。一委員問：「假定吾人之目的在設法阻止蘇聯之侵略，本案所要求之款項是否得在他處作更有效之利用」。柏德森簽稱：「該區（希臘及土耳其）在戰略上具有極重要之地位，在該處所耗費之金錢，決不致虛擲」。另一委員建議美國何不考慮「担保土國之疆界」。柏德森謂，渠覺此一步驟，猶不如財政援助計劃之有效。柏氏又謂，美政府對於土國軍事設備所知之情報，不如對於希臘之詳盡，但美國派往希臘之軍事國，人數亦僅擬以十至四十人為限。共和黨議員孟特建議派至每一國之軍事團人數以百名為限，柏氏表示並不反對此議。另一委員詢問土國邊界蘇軍實力如何，柏氏謂實力可觀。該委員又詢蘇聯是否有任何移入土國之意。柏氏謂閣下之判斷不亞於我。柏氏又謂：希臘陸軍所用係英國配備，故零件等仍宜繼續向英添購。</p>
<h3>價値百萬鎊之剩餘物資　英決定讓予希臘　兩國已正式簽訂協定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿八日電〕英外交部廿八日宣稱：英希已成立一恊定，英國以價値一百萬鎊之英國陸空軍之軍需剩餘物資移讓予希臘，共中大部份為民用者。移讓之物資中，並無軍器在內。廿八日之恊定僅為正式履行前所締結協定之原則云。</p>

<p>公債司長陳炳章來滬　籌商推銷美金債券　上海將設立推銷委員會　保障可靠認購必極踴躍　　國府發行美金庫劵及公債四億元，業已經過立法程序，定四月一日起各先發行半數。此項債劵發行動機，前者爲穩定金融，鼓勵儲蓄。後者爲充實外匯基金，調整對外貿易。而最大之目的乃爲吸收泛濫之游資。此間金融工商各界人士，對於此舉均表示不失爲吸收通貨解決財政困難之良好措施，故一般反響頗佳，物價債券均已普遍下跌。　　基金監理　會設上海　　按照發行美金庫券第十條及美金公債第九條之規定，各債劵均將設立基金監理委員會，負責辦理基金之監理事項，其委員人選除財政部，審計部，全國商會聯合會，銀行業公會及錢業公會推派代表祖任外，並由財部另行聘請人員共同組織之。據兪財長表示，監理會之組織，必力求公開及健全，且祖保將來對美金公債一定以美金償還，以示信於人民。據金融界消息，該監理委員會日內將在上海正式成立。　　組債券推　銷委員會　　財部公債司長陳炳章，以美金債券四月一日即吿發行，已奉兪部長之命於昨日由京來滬，會晤中央銀行總裁張家璈氏，會商推銷辦法。蓋此項債劵之發行，當局決勵行四大特點。（一）自由買賣，不採取若過去發行公債時之攤派方式。（二）委託銀行大公司及殷實商號公開發售，不准黑市交易，以期普及於各鄕鎭。（三）全部公債收入掃數用以建設，絕不移作他用。因此陳司長來滬後，將籌備組織推銷委員會，負責籌劃推銷工作。　　印製不及發預約券　　發行此項公債之議，時間頗爲匆促，且以債券票面共分五千元，一千元，五百元，一百元，五十元，十元等六種。（美金公債票面祗有五種）印製費時，四月一日前不及趕印就緒，故決先行發給預的券，俟栗面印就後再行公吿掉換。　　上市開拍　頗有可能　　據金融界人士觀察，政府此次發行美金債券，曾一再宣佈決把握此一時機，取信於天下，必使人民對該項債券確信有保障而樂予認購及收儲。故預料金融工商各界及一般人民必能踴躍認購，依照該項庫券及公債發行條例第十二條與第十一條之規定，人民可自由買賣，故證交方面亦希望其能早日上市，流通買賣，以適應需要。且能在推行方面能得更大之効力，是於政府考慮該項債券之上市頗有可能。米糧市銷平　　昨南北兩米市共到七千四百餘石，市銷平淡，粳米早緊午懈，無所榮辱。秈米亦無波動，白元高貨見挺千元，中下平平少神，陰元彷彿。　　麵粉供求兩稀，依然平正。麩皮受主稀少，呆平之格。油市動盪尙少，適因封關二天，店方零星添補，塲外生油略升三四千元，豆油亦加三四千元。淸油穩定，蔴油站立。豆餅油頭納胃不多，廠方供應接續，再疲三五百元。　　黃豆客銷不振，油廠亦懈。大豆漢黃均見挫落一二千元，杜黃暫無軒輊。菉豆南洋消化蟬聯，高貨挺昂二三千元，中下定局。赤豆香港搜購，收吸甚力，賡續上升，再加二三千元，芝蔴牢硬，生仁洋莊不動，步削五六千元。苞米沉悶不動，呆木之狀。紅糧回小一二千元，形則忽上忽落，蠶豆平衡。人絲交易寥寥　　昨市人造絲初因有人問訊，開盤時較昨喊高十萬元。一二〇號高山有光六百十五萬元，但乏成交，卒退至六百〇五萬元收盤。下午稍好，六百〇五萬元有人要，持貨者扳住十萬元肯脫手。廠經昨市比較上日稍靜，各檔貨均喊上日原盤，交易甚鮮。綢貨仍乏生氣，喊價價因廠方成本關係，類皆堅定。吳市長昨招待各　勸募同盟勝利公債　各業當場認定三萬萬餘元　　吳市長國楨於昨（二十八）日下午四時爲勸募同盟勝利公債，在市府舉行茶會招待各界，到市商會徐寄廎，市參議會潘公展（何西亞代），紡織業榮鴻元，錢業徐文珍，化學原料業王守恒，染織業潘士浩，毛紡織業楊立人，紙業詹沛霖，化工業吳蘊初，捲菸業戴耕莘，銀行業王志莘，進出口業張煥章。葉序馨，棉紡業劉靖基，銀樓業馮淸庵等，由吳市長親自主持。財政局副局長胡文元秘書唐性一等均參加，首由吳市長叙述本市籌募三十三年同盟勝利公債總額爲五億元，係財政部規定，現因限期即屆，特邀請各位商討如何認購，繼由財政局副局長胡文元及市商會理事長徐寄廎先後報吿勸募經過，最後經到會各公會代表認購數額如下，計棉織業一萬萬元，銀行業五千萬元，證劵業四千萬元，化工業二千五百萬元，紙業二千五百萬元，毛紡織業二千五百萬元，錢業二千萬元，染織業二千萬元，橡膠業二千萬元，餘如輪船業。顏料業。麵粉業。信託業。因無代表到會，尙未認定。除上項認購數外，餘數由各該業等籌募，以期足額，並悉三十三年同盟勝利公債，前經中央規定滬市應於本年三月底以前募足。決定由市府電請中央准予展至四月底爲止。飾金外加營業費　當局核定每兩准加九萬元　　〔本報訊〕本市銀樓業公會爲請求增加營業費用爲每兩十萬〇六千八百元，前日曾向社會局請願，昨日吳局長轉與吳市長商討結果，暫核定每兩准加九萬元。（內包括合法利潤四萬八千元，耗金，提煉費。利息，包紮，捐稅及其他共四萬二千元），正式價格，須呈請財政部核定。此項決定，吳局長已在昨日市政會議中提出報吿，並已通知該公會知照，着即促該業會員從速全部復業。據悉，該業十八家大號定於下月一日起復業，其於前日已復業之各小號，日來營業淸淡進出不大。封關影響市氣　證券交易清稀　　華股昨交易更見寥寂，封關前大戶不欲多事活動，空方逢低有補，臨收見穩少許。晨開平穩，二二三號二三一號一九七號一〇六號一四號均購，遞永紗盤高至二二七〇元。一三七號六一號四七號二一九號八八號四號三二號一五六號均加了結，又逐漸回降至二一五〇元。二一五號二〇三號五七號有納，八三號一八〇號一五二號則賣，稍呈盤旋。交易不多，徘徊至十一時十五分後，始轉盤堅。七六號二二三號一八五號九七號一四號六一號俱進，臨收形勢見堅。遞永紗升至二二八〇元高價結束。結果較前收計永紗信和新光動興微升，美亞景福新華各升半成，中法漲一成弱，遞交計永紗信和美亞新光各升半成弱，華興景福微升，冷股中紡火柴大通水泥內衣各漲半成强，國貨新亞平平，餘吿微升。塲外各股除閘北水電外，餘均微挫。　　公債昨業中人以封關在邇，咸不作活動，交易减少至五百萬元。統丙晨開一三〇〇〇元，散買略來活動，加以補空見殷，曾扳高至一五〇〇〇元大關而後轉盤。結果較前收計甲乙各降五百元，丙丁跌六百元，統戊亦挫八百元。　外股昨並無正常交易，封關之故，僅塲外暗市稍有做開，市價初低繼回，結果較前收各股均見微升，但乏多大成交。輸管會改組　已漸次就緒　　〔本報訊〕輸管會自張嘉璈兼任主委委員以來，內部改組漸次就緖。中央銀行外匯審核處裁併，其原有審核附表（三）物品輸入之工作，經已歸併非限額進口審核處辦理。其處長一職，由秘書處處長余英傑承缺。所遺秘密書處處長一乏，則另調資源委員會專門委員楊恒遞補云。焦作白煤　　京滬區不得自由運銷　　經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會，聞以所有國內白煤暫准商民自由運銷，現因焦作白煤業經指定供應京滬區公敎人員配給煤球原料之用，若任令商民自由運銷，勢必减弱煤源，該會當經呈奉經濟部指令，准將焦作白煤在京滬區域暫行取消自由運銷辦法，如有擅自購運者，一律按照該會進價，予以收購云。紗市穩定　　昨日紗市轉趨穩定，因市塲內浮根經昨日之斬售，已漸殺盡，益以紡建公司開價續見提高，而業中人略有吸納。二十支紗回好六七萬元，三十二支以上細紗，亦跟漲四五萬，然交易清淡如故，仍是盤旋之局。紡建售紗　　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例代紡管會售紗，共售一七五七件，內廠商一三九六件，紗號三六一件。申請共一三〇九戶，內廠商九四九戶，紗號三六〇戶。配售食油一再減少　　食油聯配處以六家民營榨油廠，未能及時將食油交與該處配售，故已於二十六日（星期三）起核减配額。原定由該處配出食油五百担，二十六日僅一百担，及至前昨二天（二十七日二十八日）實配數額再度減少，已不足五十担。此數與民生需要量相較，所差甚鉅，如市府當局日內無適當辦法，解決榨油原料大豆之困難者，配油勢將停止。現本市尙能維持供應者，爲經濟部中植油廠，日配七千担，乃免市塲發生恐慌。昨據油業負責人談該業支持維艱之情形，略謂週內大豆市價一再騰漲，每担越九萬元關，豆油每祖成本在三十七萬元以上，配價規定最高二十五萬元，此中差額，如各廠存底豐富，尙能勉爲其難。惟目前各廠因以往配售損失不貲，資金周轉極感因難，六廠存油合計二百担，原料存底最多者五天，少則一天，均無法延續。本星期初，平均各廠開工三分之一，維持五百担產量，現幾陷於悲慘境地。各廠曾於一上月杪向東北收購大豆若千車，爲便利運滬起見，托中植油廠設法代運。惟接東北行轅經濟委員會函稱，經濟緊急措施期間，未經特許者一律不准運往任何地點，故民營廠商自購原料，供應民一需，希望亦吿幻滅云庫券公債必須保守信用　對外輸出前途亦甚樂觀　匯豐銀行總裁之談話　　〔路透社香港廿八日電〕匯豐銀行總裁莫爾士，頃在該行年會報吿席上，檢討遠東局勢稱，撇開一切希望不談，中國國內情形之演變，已令人大失所望，故檢討其外匯情勢，徒費唇舌，然以多數國家之財政，已陷於危險境地，故應竭力設法避免此項局勢之惡化。問題本身，仍在中國，國民政府及中國人民，均應共盡最大努力。一俟時機到來，外援雖不必要，但無疑仍有其價値。關於中國政府發行金庫券及美金公債，莫氏謂在國內政治及通貨情形明朗之前，冀其能採取有效之行動，應付此等債券。若政府對債劵所有人之權利，能給予若干公開保證，則一般對之，當表滿意。即如債劵持有人之應得權利，須予以維護，不能爲疇昔政府或半官方性質之各種公債或信用券之陋習敗壞。莫氏强調中國對外貿易之重要稱：中國東九省及台灣省之輸出遠景，至為樂觀，但須在各該地能有滿意恢復之後。關於印度，莫氏稱：去年討論一俟過渡政府成立，即將政權交出，其卓越價値，當歷久不墜，雖然政局倐忽不定，但印度之貿易，至稱良好。輸廣執委昨日開會　商討加緊推廣外銷　　〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，於三月廿八日上午十一時，在中央銀行舉行第七次會議，出席者張嘉璈，劉攻芸，沈熙瑞等，由張主任委負主席。會中討論要案多起：（一）我國在國際緊急糧食會議中，同意於一九四七年提供油脂一案，會中曾加討論。除桐油因不供食用，可以劃出配額，自由輸出外。其餘大豆油，花生油，菜籽油等，如何供應，經決定交小組即速研擬具體意見。（二）中國蠶絲公司提議：以運美日絲影響我國出口生絲價格，會中亦加討論，極表重視，決定下週召開絲綢小組會，連同生絲根本間題，澈底商討。（三）猪鬃，草帽鞭，刺繡，紡織品，及桐油等小組會，分別擬送會議紀錄到會，對於各該項出口貨物，加緊生產，推廣外銷之辦法，曾加討論，即將陸續實施。（四）畜產品小組會及蛋品小組會委員名單，經提會通過。畜產品小組會召集人A.E.Marker，委員武立侯，張玉延，張眙志，A.C.Baylin，P.Huet，委員兼秘書袁家麟。蛋品小組會召集人劉攻芸，委員鄭源興，王品藻，邱良榮，P.Huet，G.La　Paire，委員兼秘書方善桂。今日青年節　各市塲停業　　今日爲黃花崗七十二烈十紀念及靑年節，本市米市，油市。紗市。公債股票各市塲均停業一日，卅一日起照常開市云。轉抵押重貼現　央行定新辦法　　〔本報訊〕商業行莊過去向中央銀行辦理轉抵押，重貼現，原係按組織銀團辦法，每家以二億元爲限。將押匯每家則以三億元爲限，兩共五億元。茲悉：該項辦法，最近即將取銷。按照新辦法，中央銀行對每一商業行莊辦理轉抵押，重貼現，及轉押匯之額度，將改爲不超過該一行莊實收資本，及上月底存款總額，减去法定存款準備金總數爲標準。辦理對象，仍將以生產事業，出口業，日用品運銷事業等爲主。中央銀行爲辦理此事，將於下週內設置貼放委員會，委員將聘請本市商業銀行家擔任之，聞主委將由秦潤卿擔任云。自由買賣不得超過紡管會限制紗價　經紀人酌加合法利潤　　〔本報訊〕紡管會於日前分別致函第六區棉紡公會及紗業市塲，對紗廠自由買賣部份之開售價，及紗業市塲經紀人加合法利潤（百分之五）後之自由交易價，最高不得超過下開標準：　　紗廠自由買賣之開售價　　經紀人之目由交易價</p>

<p>春秋	三·二九起義黨人詩札  陸丹林　　黃花崗烈士殉國紀念，是指民國前一年夏曆三月二十九日（一九一一年四月二十七日），革命黨人在廣州起義失敗殉難的紀念日。在當時說是七十二烈士，這一個數目，恰合地然星的數。可是，在最近的十年來，經過了幾度的詳細考查，這次殉難的烈士，實際的人數是八十六。不過為了七十二烈士成了歷史的定名，還是照常稱謂，等於三月二十九日的日子，也由陰曆改做陽曆，便於記憶了。　　關於三月二十九，廣州之役的壯烈史事，三十六年來，報章刋物，已經速篇累牘的記載得很詳盡。現在不想贅說他的史事，却尋覓關於此役的黨人詩文，摘錄一些。言為心聲。浩氣萬丈沖霄漢，也可以知道當年黨人們懷慨悲歌，氣吞胡虜的壯志雄心的一斑。　　發動的日子決定了，在這一天的早晨，黃克強（興）特寫絕筆信，寄給南洋同志。第一封是給鄧澤如的，信云：　　「澤如先生大鑒：事冗，未獲時通音問，罪甚，罪甚！本日親赴陣地，誓身先士卒，努力殺賊，不敢有負諸賢之期望。所有此次出入款項淸冊，雖細數亦有登記，當先寄呈各埠宜布，决荷屬决南北美洲各埠，無論成敗，俾其曉然此次之款，涓滴歸公。弟等不才，預備或有未周，用途即因之不當，負咎殊深！所冀漢族有幸，一舉獲捷，吾則寸鑠吾軀，亦不足以蔽罪。惟此心公明，足以對諸公耳。絕筆。弟黃興頓首。在劍拔弩張般誓師出發的緊要關頭，念念不忘用款的瑣屑，所說「此心公明」，便是一切事業成功的基礎。黃氏還有給培臣，螺生，源水，孝章，應章五同志的絕命書云：　　一事冗，無暇通候，罪過，罪過！本日馳赴陣地，誓身先士卒，努力殺賊。書此以當紹筆。即頌籌安！弟黃興頓首。」　　斬釘截鐵約有力語氣，勇往直前的氣概，雖寥寥幾句話，充分的表露出來了。　　方子明（聲洞）赴義前一天寫給他的父親絕筆信有云：　　「邇者，海內外諸同志共謀起義，以撲滿淸政府，以救祖國；祖國之存亡，在此一舉。事敗，則中國不免於亡，四萬萬人皆死，不特兒一人。如事成，則四萬萬人皆生，兒雖死亦樂也。祗以大人愛兒者，故臨死不敢不為稟告。但望大人以國事為心，勿傷兒之死，則幸甚矣。……　　為國即以為家，死中求生而救祖國，半命黨人的志大願宏，活躍在字裏行間。數十年後讀之，愛國精神，突然興奮。　　林意洞（覺民）從容就義之日，年纔二十五歲。當他殉國後，他的父親接着他的絕筆書，斬截幾句話：　　「兒死矣，淮果大人吃苦，弟妹缺衣食耳，然大有補於全國同胞也。大罪，乞恕之！」　　婉轉哀壯，如聞其聲。林氏還有給他的夫人陳意要女士一信，眞是纏綿悱惻，血淚交并，其性戀愛的眞諦，分別的很淸楚，林氏此信，可以代表了。　　李炳輝由南洋歸國從事實際行動時，他的母親譚氏寫信勸他回家，他覆信詳告不能回家的理由，並附了七絕一首云：　　「回頭二十年前事，此日呱呱墮地時。慚愧劬勞恩未報，只綠報國誤烏私」。　　看他這二十八個字，摯性決心，兼而有之。　　趙百先（聲），文韜武略，三月二十九之役失敗逃港，後二十一日吐血死，他的遺詩，慷慨激越，如登越王臺云：　　「七雄兼并　無謂，劉項紛爭祗自殘；堅向南天開版籍，能將文化服夷蠻。公眞矍鑠威千古，我尚飄零姓氏慚。今日登樓頻北望，中原妖霧正漫漫。」他還有集古詩：「汲古得修中如云：　　「……吾至愛汝，即此愛汝一念，使吾勇於就死也。吾自遇汝以來，常願天下有情人都成眷屬，然遍地腥雲，滿街狼犬，稱心快意，幾家能　？司馬春衫，吾不能學太上之忘情也。語云，仁者『老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼」。吾充吾愛汝之心，助天下人愛其所愛，所以敢先汝而死，不顧汝也。汝體吾此心於啼泣之餘，亦以天下人為念，當亦樂犧牲吾身與汝身之福利，為天下人謀永福也，汝其勿悲。……」　　認識主義的革命靑年能够判別大我小我的區分，人生觀和兩綆，交情脫寶刀」的聯語，豪情一俠氣，不作頭中語。　　林南散（文），刻有「進為諸葛退淵明」印章，可以知道他的抱負了。他有秋聲五古一首云　　　「蒞葉聞歸雁，江帆起暮鴉；秋風千萬戶，不見漢人家。我亦傷心者，登臨夕照斜；何堪更啣血，墮作自由花。」末兩句，和朱執信（大符）的詩：「水流還朝宗，葉落還肥根，」此物此志，是相同的。林氏又有朋友一萬云：　　「秦始河山百二重，如今何處覓堯封？鄭洪義舉斜陽冷，葛岳奇才碧水空；世事何曾哀樂盡，野花依舊寂寞紅。魚龍殘月誰能嘯？只此傷心萬古同。」吐屬不凡，和歎老嗟貧的呻吟，自然是兩樣的。　　國父說是役集各省革命之精英，與彼虜為最後之一搏，事雖不成，而黃花崗七十二烈士轟轟烈烈之慨，已震動全球，而國內革命之時勢，賴以造成。意義的重大，可以知道了。所以參加此役黨人的詩句信札，都有時代價値，殺身成仁的心志，大義皎然，確是革命青年的本色。梅花  王作舟黃花崗憶舊錄  許士騏　　距今三十七年前，當淸宣統三年，三月二十九日，革命黨人，謀攻督署，事敗，殉難者七十二人，計有喻培倫，林文，宋玉琳，饒國棟，林覺民諸烈士，卜葬於廣州北門外，白雲山之麓，猶憶當年黃克強烈士弔黃花岡詞一首（蝶戀花）　　「轉眼黃花看發處，為囑西風暫把香籠住；待灑滿校淸豔露，和香吹上無情墓。回首羊城三月暮，血肉紛飛氣直吞在虜，事敗垂成原鼠子，英雄地下長無語。」　　宋敎仁烈士詩，七律一首：「孤月殘雲了一生，無情天地恨何平？常山節烈終呼賊，崖海風波失援兵。特為兩間留正氣，空敎千古說忠名；傷心漢室終難復，血染社鵑淚有弔黃花崗  太虛　　人間源署又嚴寒，易葛移裘總覺難；劍作龍吟亦徒爾，夢如螺旋未能殘；一天星斗明明見，滿地胭脂點點看；萬種愁懷誰遣得？曉猿啼徹大江干。　　紫楓謹案；太虛和尚，在民國前一年，寄寓廣州白雲山寺院。三月二十九日之役，清吏緝捕黨人，因太虛時與黨人往還，言論思想，迥異普通僧侶。事涉嫌疑，太虛即離粵北上。前月，余為編寫黃花崗詩話，去函徽集材料，承其寫示舊作一首。詎知太虛怛化旬餘，又為黃花佳節。墨瀋未乾，斯人竞寂，執筆錄詩，撫時感事，不勝今昔之感。悼太虛上人並序  成惕軒　　三十六年三月十七日，太虛上人以腦溢血症，在滬示寂。龍華霜委，遽登選佛之塌；塵尾麋封，誰續高僧之傳。因憶十五年前（民國廿一年），避地漢皋，曾隨唐先生大圓，與上人共遊武昌之東湖；於時武漢大學校舍初告落成，東湖縈帶其下，澄被鏡平，風景如畫，余賦詩紀事，有「妙論直敎頭點石，淸談眞覺腋生風」，及「山色靜含金粟影，溪流如帶海潮音」之句，迄今思之，歷歷如昨。島倭變作，襥被東川，上人亦卓鍚縉雲，惜阻一衣帶水，莫由展晤。還都踰歲，噩耗驚傳，竟壞金剛之身，曷盡人天之感。電光石火，瞬息便已千秋；鴻爪雪泥，前塵付之一夢。　　吳蜀都虛再貝緣，剎那成佛便生天。神遊正竺三千界，夢客東胡十五年；歷切鶯花終是幻，談經龍樹更誰賢。慈航已共春波逝，望斷申江一　然黃花祭  呂白華　　粵崗的黃花，　　劃下了「三，一一九」　　這革命先蘿的旗影，　　偉大的烈士之碧血。　　對的，這節日的詔示，　　黃花蘊孕靑年的怒潮，　　為中國之命運而奮鬥，　　十年，廿年，三十年。　　尤其是三十年的前後，　　在大地每一角，　　千萬靑年繼承着碧血，　　黃花是不孤寂的。　　現在，應該向粵崗薦一瓣心香了！　　可是，為什麼還聽炮吼？　　黃花在濺淚，　　我悵望四邊的烽火！青年頌  蕭亢石　　——為黃花崗卅六週年紀念日作——　　靑年如起日初升，　　光芒萬丈，　　應該緬懷着先烈，　　抱着純潔的思想，　　但流光如機，　　稍縱即逝，　　維護着先烈創造的——　　自由之花！　　勤劬地灌溉，　　不使它憔悴，枯萎，　　使它更光明燦爛，　　普照着世界！一寸山河一寸血207  葉勁風　　前情節略　　八年抗戰，我國千百萬英勇的中華兒女，為了守衛祖國，拿鮮紅的熱血，洒遍了每寸山河。我們收集了這些悲壯的　實，來紀念恢復失土的艱苦。　　第一個故實——「七封秘緘」——記載倭寇勾結了歐陸幾個戰麾，訂定了七紙秘密文件，要蹂躪世界，毀滅一切，來滿足他們的私慾。　　青年鶴見玉，從搖籃起到陸大畢業止，受的是「侵略敎育」。也許由於血統純正，主張乃富於正義感，看不慣倭寇那種破落戶的作風——奸，擄，燒，殺，放賭，販毒，敲詐，勒索，種種罪犯犯為。下在起了返感當口，偶然發見他本人原是一位中國老同盟古繼漢先生的嫡親骨血。同進又風聞「七封秘緘」的消息，於是徵集同志，設了十二座秘密電臺，並且設法參加了黑籠會，要把這秘密文件揭露，來挽回這生靈塗炭的大刦。　　他傾心自己造就的東北女兒紀耀羣，同時為了探取七封秘緘，衝入魔窟的時候，又被黑龍會的健將中村萍子，跟蹤糾纏。他知道沒有萍子合作，無法獲到秘緘。萍子却透給他一個「八的秘密」；這「八」的秘密計劃，即世界大戰的眞正導火綫，如不冒險在四十八小時內設法破壞，雖然揭露七封秘緘，亦無功效。鶴見玉見事機已迫眉睫，同意飛滬，進行破壞工作……　　第一卷　七封秘緘　第八章　「零九一五」　　晨曦初上，時間約莫六點卅分左右，一隻小型油艇，船尾懸着一面太陽小旗，衝風破浪，其快有如弩箭離弦，把黃浦的江水，刺成一條槽一般，兩邊捲開，騰潘滾，變作兩三尺高的浪花；那皯順水或逆水慢慢划着的舢舨，也只好逆來順受，把船身調得斜些，迎着浪頭，或背着浪頭，任牠一上一下的顧播着可見這隻小油艇的勢派，確能影響水面的大局哩。　　油艇快到匯山碼頭，這才放緩速度，揀了最低的一隻小躉船，靠了攏去。艇上兩個水手，剛剛用銅挽鉤，把艇身定住，就見船艙裏，走出了一雙靑年男女，一律吳服，都長得那般英姿颯爽，服裝整潔，兩個水手，一手把住挽鉤，一手齊眉，行着軍禮。兩人相將上了躉船，一個水手忙着拋去挽鉤，鑽到艙繪裏，提出兩隻西式旅行箱，送到躉船上。　　這時天亮不久，岸上行人稀少，只見沿岸一個號衣勤務模樣的人，順着木級跳板，飛奔下來。到了這雙靑年男女面前，還隔着三五尺遠近，急忙煞住脚步，行了敬禮，一面喘氣，一面嘰哩咕嚕，大的是說，車十就在碼頭上，勞動貴步，走了上去的意思。　　勤務伺候二人上車，剛把兩隻旅行箱，一隻一隻安放在前市廂裏的時候，那個女的問着男的：　　男的正在燃着姻捲，還沒來得及答應，只見車外，轉過一個衣衫襤褸，乞丐一般的少年，一手搭住車窗，露出一口雪白的牙齒，笑着點頭：　　「這就是上海！」說着一口流利的日語。自由談	年輕的毒犯  月鳳　　經高院覆判死刑的販毒犯徐光和，於日節在提籃橋上海監獄內執行槍決了。據說這是勝利以來實行禁毒以後滬市販毒犯被判死刑而執行槍決的第一人。以一個販毒犯而論，其毒害種族的行為，自屬罪大惡極，雖槍決而仍舊可說他一聲死有餘辜。然而增了報上所載這個年輕的毒犯就戮時情形，眞令人不能沒有感觸。　　此人祗有二十三歲，實在是一個年輕小夥子。在他父母的心目之中，應該還是一個孩子吧。他還有一個哥哥，因而他在家庭中可能格外獲得父母的寵愛，如果他有機會受高等敎育的話，那末在老敎授們的　堂上，他不過是一個未脫稚氣的少年，可是他却因販毒而犯了死罪而被槍決的。　　從他們就刑的情形來看，他並不是一條「硬」漢。換句話說，他對自已的生命，心腸沒有那些「硬」漢那樣地狠。他「淚如雨下」了他還有一顆稚嫩的心。　　在「騐明正身」的時候，除了要求法官通知其兄前來收屍以外，他還要求迭官千萬不要使他的生母知悉，以免傷心。他知道他的母親愛他，他也愛他的母親，所以在萬事絕望的最後一剝那，還想從消極方面給他母親一點愛護。這句話出之於一個二十三歲的少年，更增加了刑場的悲劇氣氛。　　凡是愛惜靑年的成年人，對此沒有不感到痛心的吧。這個少年的罪狀是「生前並無正當職業，專事販賣毒品」。這不是他的罪狀，這是成年人的社會的罪狀。我們沒有好好愛護他，反而將他生生地殺了！「特別謹慎」  季水　　中國航空公司外總專家應特Bond氏，認為過去歷次飛行機失事，由於設備不良者少，而最主要的實因大意疏忽的緣故。所以氏特提出一個唯一有效的方法，即為「特別謹慎」四個很簡單明瞭的字　　這眞是一句一針見血的話，一個對症下藥的方法。試想去年龍華上空失事的三機，在這樣的大霧天裏，竟敢冒着險起飛，或維續航行，其負責和駕駛的人員的大意疏忽，即外行人如筆者，亦能知道。故龐特氏此語，凡我航空界同志，都有時時刻刻引以為警惕自已，要時時刻刻問問自己，有否奉行此一方法的必要，則飛行機失事的減少可期。　　不但飛行機為然，環顧半年來，即上海一隅，火警時有所聞，汽車撞死個把人，日必一起，一大者如卡軍和火車相撞，此次伏一波號和商輪相撞，竟使此一百六一七十個如何艱辛訓練出來的海軍一，慘遭滅頂，凡此種種，何一非一負責或駕駛人員大意疏忽所致，故龐特氏此語，雖專對航空界言，即甩以減少所有不幸事件，亦為一最重要最精確的方法，甚願我各界同胞三復斯言。自費留學生及其他  陸沉　　報載：「自費留學生雖欲照現行官價結匯赴美深造者，外交部亦暫不擬簽發護照，特准行文交辦者例外，良以外部近對護照申請審核極嚴，故簽發極少」。又云：「外部頃據舊金山總領事來函稱：以我國留美學生多希望半工半讀以撙節開支，惟照美國移民規律：（一）凡持普通護照而美領事以游歷簽證來美者，照例不能留居一年，且不得受僱於任何工作；（二）凡以學生簽證來美求學者，亦不得兼受僱用，故希望來美學生勿存過高理想」云云。「據此」，我們可以看出世界上任何一個非殖民地形式的國家，不論其是「強」是「弱」，是「大」是「小」，對於「外國人的進口」，是絕對沒有像那般「未來的留學生」想像中的「如入無人之境」　　　兄弟之邦儘管理兄弟之邦，駢肩作戰儘管是駢肩作戰，手續自有交代，不能把中美合為一體，「留學」當然可嘉，但是入國問禁，「出國明律」，三分顏色開染坊，川人曰：「要不得，要不得」也。　　大票，決議停止發行，其所與承印廠商之合同，將「着即」取消，然而除乘電車公共汽軍之外，銀行出納的櫃台上，你要「大票」，他要「大票」之聲，此起彼伏，一如「非大票過不去」之勢者，可是「眞正大累」一箱箱的發出來，則各惶惶不可終“‘斯之謂；「矛盾一元化」。　　擊斃臧大二子兇手案，樂經美軍「駐滬」軍法庭宜判，「被告無罪，釋放歸國」矣。美國是民主先進國家，而我們正在「氏主的萌芽時期」，那末幼稚的氏主當然要跟先進的「學」「學」，「宣判無罪，釋放歸國」入個大字，「硬是要得」！天使乎  果　　甲女：「她嫁給他眞要怨死了，我敢祖保。」　　乙女：「奇怪，你怎麽能說這個話！他將她看作一個十全十美的天使，因此——」　　甲女：「——因此他眞把她當作天使看待。他半點兒穿的戴的都不買給她了。」影譚「慾海潮」  無邊　　看了「慾海潮」使我們感到庸俗的劇作者，永遠在廉價的拍賣女人，尤其在作者不健全的變態心理下，色情的故事在他們筆尖下飛舞，封建餘孽的毒　素在影片中傳播。　　「慾海潮」的編導老楊小仲悲劇，他告訴觀眾任何事情都是「善有善報，惡有惡報」的，可的研究一下這故事，那可以找得出它是從曹禺的「雷雨」改編而來的。但是「雷雨」中魯媽這個人物是封建社會下的犧牲者，本劇中的郭王氏（交際花林冰靑的母親）都是一個不安份的女人。她本身的行為已經失掉了觀眾的同情，作為悲劇人物的主角，已經是成了問題，而那個交際花林冰靑與她的愛人（也是弟弟）郭人駿更是莫明其妙的人物，他們的正義感與進步行為是從那裏來的？實在想不出一點生活上的根據，尤其是那幾個低能的地下工作者，竟去要求於一個陌生的交際花，請她擔任這樣一件重大而秘密的任務，這實在是作者的白日說夢，否則，那只有是對地下工作者的諷刺了。　　這劇本的情節確實是編造得曲折離奇的，但這不是一個眞實的故事，只是一段虛構到荒謬的劇情。全片中找不出所企岡表達的主題是什麽？有的，那只是一些誇張的色情描寫，玩弄女人，拍翼女人罷了。　　導演的處理手法，是陳舊而庸俗的，他只注意了那些低級的趣味與色情的無聊噱頭，郭和尚強姦交際花，撕去她的旗袍，不惜用特寫來暴露女人的肉體，取得色情觀眾的滿足，那是十足的下流與卑劣。「鬍子和駝子」——中少劇團首次演出　　　　在劇運低潮中，却有許多人在埋頭從事兒童戲劇，但作為正式演出，目前祗看到中國少年劇團，於三月廿三日上演了「鬍子和駝子。」　　中國少年劇團為陳鶴琴先生領導，成立以後，積極排演了幾個戲，但為了减低票價，與接近兒童，這次的演出決定借座愚圍路市立女師大禮堂，上下午共演兩場。　　「鬍子和駝子」是三幕劇，為包蕾編著，頗有敎育意味，導素演英郁，以手法穩健活潑著稱，這次導演兒童劇，非常成功。演負是成人和兒童一同參演出，加約有舞台名演員仲夏·陳朋·由於經騐和修養的豐富，他們提供了兒童劇演技的方式。這是值得注意的。　　兒童演員陳一新和秀蘭以他們天其活潑獲得觀眾一致好評。陳鶴琴先生在他的揭幕致詞中說：「兒童劇在世只各國都有　……中國少年劇團也終於演出了希望大家予以鼓勵。」一張王牌  馬進　　「沒收貪官污吏財產」，是國民黨三中全會的決議案之一誠如與論所指，這是一件「革命性的決議」；惟其具有革命性，故實行起來便絕不簡單。　　揆之目前經濟情形，所以搞到工商凋敝民生府有無實行的魄艱困的境地，官力和勇氣；「打僚豪門資本實難空砲」或者「決辭其咎；這種官而不行」都切切僚豪門資本的由要不得了，因為來，幾乎全部是人民已再不能忍貪官污吏的財產耐。。正本淸源，這欲挽經濟之件決議案該是必狂瀾，欲救吾民須實行，而且急於水火者，我想待實行的，，這算是一張王　　問題只在政牌。危城記  秦瘦鷗　　「不要急」，二表姐！老祝這個人活得很，保管會把排排找回來的」徐胖子很輕飄地說，他覺得這時候做一個現戚的至少總該勸慰幾句了。　　蘭理也不理他。　　小沈也竭力帮着動　，可是他，一個吃慣，玩慣，胡鬧慣的大少爺，在這種時候，眞覺得空有了一身本領，無處施展。他又不敢像老祝那樣的拼着性命跑出去找人。　　「小第弟，別哭！兎子多得很，明兒我再給你買幾個來！」想了好一會，才給他想出了幾句話，打算先把榮兒逗得歡憲起來；雖然他自已也很糢糊，不知道這孩子所說的兎子爸爸究竟是個什麼東西。　　榮兒簡直像沒有聽見，還是哭個不　　　「別睬他，沈先生。他說的不是兎子。」小沈總究是很客氣的生人，蘭不能不勉強定一定心，敷衍他幾句。　　「不是兎子！那是什麽東西啊？」徐胖子也感覺興趣起來。　　「是一個玩具。」冷然的回答。　　洞口又進來了三四個人蘭竭力睜大眼睛，打　淡的燈光下望過去，可是來的全是大人，沒有孩子，也不見那一條她看熟了的瘦長的身影。　　炸彈的爆炸聲和機關槍聲息而復作、好些人在議論着今晚這次空襲的嚴重。　　蘭的身體開始有一些顫抖。　　「奇怪！一個玩具？我怎麽沒見過」徐紹明的好奇心還沒有滿足，他覺得熒呌那個玩具為兎子爸爸，眞是一件思議的怪事。　　蹲踞在靠壁的地上，奉命專給他七　照管一大箱現鈔和貴重物品的阿史，對於這個兎子爸爸倒還見渦幾面，這時便插嘴出來解釋；一半是淺薄的賣弄，一半身　討好徐胖子。　　「不錯的，那是一頭銅做的兎子。怪好玩兒的！「他點頭播腦地打着全部廣市音的上海話說：「弟弟妹妹都歡喜它。有一些像一個人，穿着工裝，後腿直立着·右邊的前腿像人的手一樣的抓着一枝樹枝做的手杖，背上抗着一大梱木柴，也是　刻成的，染的靑色。哈！那個刻工眞好！兔子跟木柴全像眞的一樣！還有兩……」（二八）兩小無嫌猜　你牙齒痛我嚼給你吃  　　堂</p>

<h3>Central Government Commemorates Revolutionary Martyrs; Chairman Chiang Publishes Letter to Youth, Encouraging Dedication to National Salvation, Unity, and Stability</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The central government, in commemoration of the National Revolution Martyrs' Memorial Day and Youth Day, will hold a memorial ceremony at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Chairman Chiang will preside. Starting at 11:00 AM, sacrifices will be made at Linggu Temple. Central Committee members in Nanjing, party and government personnel, and personnel from the Army, Navy, and Air Force will all participate. From 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, the Beijing branch of the Youth League and the National Chengchi University will host a World Youth Education Evening, with representatives from fourteen countries participating. Furthermore, the Beijing branch of the Youth League will organize a spring outing on the 29th, with Tangshan as the destination.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The 29th is the fourth Youth Day. Chairman Chiang published a letter to the youth of the nation, the original text of which is as follows: Today is the memorial day of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and it is also a revolutionary memorial day for striving for the equality and freedom of the Chinese nation, for the unification and independence of the Republic of China, and for the realization of the Three Principles of the People: of the people, by the people, and for the people. The martyrs' heroic sacrifice and courageous dedication established an eternal and imperishable glory for our Chinese nation, and created an unshakable foundation for our Republic of China for all ages. We commemorate the martyrs and encourage the youth, so four years ago, we specifically designated today as Chinese Youth Day. All patriotic Chinese youth, on this glorious memorial day, should admire the revolutionary martyrs, cherish revolutionary history, and work together with a united and active effort to carry forward and expand the Republic of China created by our martyrs and the revitalized Chinese nation, so that we may not be unworthy of being revolutionary followers of our Founding Father, and to comfort the heroic spirits of our revolutionary martyrs. This year's Youth Day is precisely when our democratic constitution has been announced and the work of unification is being actively promoted. Our youth must naturally be encouraged and inspired to commemorate the glorious achievements of the revolutionary martyrs' struggle, and strive to be the cadres who build our Republic of China. However, reflecting on the current situation in the country, in the past year, national unity has been greatly damaged and the people's lives have been greatly distressed. I believe that our revolutionary youth with courage and integrity will commemorate this festive day with a heavy heart. We often say, "The blood of the martyrs is the flower of the revolution." Recalling the year when our Youth Day began, it was the most intense and critical year of the war of resistance against Japan. Patriotic youth across the country inherited the fragrance of Huanghua’s green blood and emulated the martyrs' dedication to national salvation. Immediately after the establishment of Youth Day, there was the great event of 100,000 educated youth joining the army, which made the world look at Chinese youth with new eyes. Later, the Youth Army's arduous and glorious achievements on the battlefields of Yunnan and Burma fulfilled the task of winning the war of resistance, demonstrating that once the strength of Chinese educated youth is gathered and brought into play, it can make unlimited contributions to the country. Immediately following the victory of the war of resistance against Japan, the most urgent needs of our country were unity and stability, and post-war reconstruction. This war was an unprecedented large-scale war, and it was also an unprecedentedly brutal war. China fought for the longest time and suffered the most severe damage, and its need for unity, stability, and post-war reconstruction is also the most urgent. I once stated that "To improve the lives of our compatriots lies in construction, to overcome economic difficulties lies in construction, to eliminate the pain of unemployment lies in construction, to consolidate the foundation of the country, and maintain the glory of victory, also lies in construction." In order to ensure that our post-war reconstruction can be carried out smoothly, the central government has spared no effort to seek a foundation for peaceful unification, and has tried in every way to compromise in order to awaken those who create division and destroy unification. Unfortunately, all peace talks have been rejected by the Communist Party. A year and a half of efforts after the victory of the war of resistance have all come to nothing, causing chaos to increase daily and the people's lives to become more difficult. The glory of the victory of the war of resistance will be lost because of this, and the independent and equal status of the nation will also be greatly affected. This behavior of the Communist Party destroys the unification of the country and hinders the progress of construction. It is not only a criminal against our revolutionary martyrs, but also a traitor to our nation. Under this situation, our patriotic youth must make effective contributions to the country and the nation, and must choose their own path.</p>
<h3>Adhere to a Pure Stance</h3>
<p>The path for young people to serve the country is certainly not just one, but the most urgent need for the country and the people lies in construction. After the victory of the war of resistance, our greatest task is to build the country, and the foundation of building the country lies in unification. Without unification, the country cannot carry out construction, the people cannot live and work in peace, and the nation cannot obtain equal and free status. Therefore, the primary task for our youth to serve the country today is to strive to create an environment of unification. The so-called environment of unification must be stable in order, not chaotic. In thought and action, it must be active, not destructive. The reason why the independence, equality, and dignity of our country have not been universally respected after the victory of the war of resistance is because the Communist Party has launched an armed rebellion, occupied territory, disrupted society, harmed the people, and destroyed unification. Therefore, the nation has suffered such great humiliation today. Now, if our youth want to wash away this shame, it cannot be achieved by a momentary emotional impulse alone. We must fight against the forces that oppose unification and construction. We must make every effort to promote national unification and create social stability. We must adhere to our pure stance and develop our patriotic virtues. We must prevent political careerists from using schools and factories as places of struggle. Therefore, we must respect academic freedom, maintain social order, and increase national production for the sake of the country and the nation. First of all, we must make ourselves independent and unwavering youth, and create a good environment for genuine learning in our educational institutions. Do not act rashly because of stimulation, and do not blindly follow incitement. Schools are the model of society. If schools can be stable, they can further help to achieve social stability. Only with such active and stable forces can a unified environment be established. Only in this way can our country not be despised by others, our national construction can proceed smoothly, and our youth will have a path to employment and service to the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, our youth must strive to study and make full preparations for construction work. The Founding Father often said, "To be determined to make a revolution, one must have profound knowledge as the foundation." The Founding Father's leadership of the revolution throughout his life, and his great achievements, were all due to his profound knowledge. Today, the construction needed by our country is truly complex and extensive. The rapid progress of science, technology, and industry in modern countries is happening at an astonishing pace. Whether we talk about production and construction or social progress, we are far behind. Patriotic youth across the country must know that if we talk about national humiliation, this is the root of national humiliation. If we talk about responsibility, this is the greatest responsibility of the youth. We must seize this youth, catch up quickly, and strive to learn. Only by acquiring profound knowledge can we make genuine contributions to national construction. Furthermore, it is important to know that respecting teachers and valuing the Way is the basis for obtaining practical benefits from learning, and fostering a good school spirit by constantly improving and not being complacent is the foundation for students to learn from each other and improve their morals. We must not fail this great era, and we must not waste our extremely valuable life. We must have the spirit of "If not me, who?" to make the effort to catch up.</p>
<h3>Recognize the Responsibilities of the Era, Clearly Distinguish Between Right and Wrong, and Understand Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Strive for Self-Salvation and National Salvation</p>
<p>Patriotic youth across the country, youth are the pioneers who create the era, and they are the new life of the nation. In China, the first to advocate revolution, from the Founding Father onwards, such as Lu Haodong and Shi Jianru and other martyrs, were all youth. The 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang were also mostly youth. The Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition of the 15th year, and this war of resistance against Japan, most of those who contributed the most lives and strength were also youth. Chinese youth have already written a glorious record in history, enough to be immortalized with our Chinese nation. Now, although the war of resistance has ended, national construction has not yet succeeded. The current era is an era of construction. The country needs you to build it, and needs you to establish brilliant achievements in construction and create a bright future. You must rejuvenate your spirit and strive actively. You must never drift along with the crowd or belittle yourselves. Furthermore, it is important to know that the country has entered the early stages of democratic constitutionalism and must guarantee the independence of academia in order to maintain a good environment for youth to study. Therefore, you must not waste your good years and abundant energy on pessimistic emotions of wandering frustration and fruitless political struggles. You should recognize the era, recognize your responsibilities. Those who disrupt society and harm the people are traitors to our country. Those who destroy unification and hinder construction are the scum of our nation. Whoever disrupts our order, stifles our vitality, prevents our students from studying, prevents our farmers from cultivating, prevents our workers from working, and prevents our merchants from doing business, is the public enemy of our people. We must clearly distinguish between right and wrong, analyze advantages and disadvantages, shoulder responsibility for the country, and bear the mission for the times. On this glorious memorial day, we should also remember the unwavering character of the revolutionary martyrs and emulate the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country, in order to transform the environment of construction, support the forces of stability, complete unification, and be loyal to the country. Only in this way will we not be unworthy of the meaning of establishing Youth Day. Youth across the country, as we hold Youth Day in such a chaotic and devastated environment in the country, I hope that you can all set your ambitions, make up your minds, work together, and strive for self-salvation and national salvation.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang received the Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ismail, at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 28th. He inquired in detail about the recent situation in Egypt and expressed regret that he did not meet with the King of Egypt when he went to Egypt to attend the Cairo Conference in 1943.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Minister Zhang Lisheng recently told our reporter about the principles of reorganizing the government, saying: It is rumored that a certain party wants a certain department of the government, but nothing has been decided yet. However, in terms of the principles of reorganization, whether in the UK or the US, the entry of political parties into the cabinet involves changes in political officials, not changes in administrative officials. If a country's civil service system is well-established, there is no need to change it due to changes in political parties. Therefore, the reorganization of the government only involves political officials and does not involve administrative officials.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] A certain government official revealed that the reorganization of the State Council Committee is waiting for the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to be submitted before it can be announced. The 17 members of the Kuomintang Committee have not yet been fully decided. After the State Council Committee is reorganized, the Executive Yuan will immediately follow. The candidates who have already been decided are Sun Ke concurrently as the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun as the President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao as the Vice President, Gan Naiguang as the Secretary-General, and Pu Xuefeng as the Deputy Secretary-General.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association will hold its first standing committee meeting in Nanjing on the 29th.

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party held a central standing committee meeting at Fan Garden at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the list of members of the State Council Committee. There were different opinions at the meeting. As a result, it was decided to postpone the submission and to send Xu Chuanlin, Jiang Yuntian, and other members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association to Nanjing by car yesterday to meet with the central government and discuss everything in person while attending the meeting of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. Li Daming and Hu Haimen are scheduled to go to Nanjing today. Secretary-General Lei Zhen visited Zhang Junmai after the Democratic Socialist Party meeting yesterday to urge him to submit the list of State Council Committee members first. He also visited the Democratic Socialist Party office in the evening to visit the standing committee members, indicating that he was willing to convey all opinions, but hoped that the list of State Council Committee members could be submitted first. Lei Zhen was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing last night, so he postponed it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Hu Haimen, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party in the north, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and told reporters that Liang Qiushui had asked him to represent him and brought a "verbal message," the content of which he did not want to disclose. When asked whether the Northern Party members opposed participating in the State Council and the Executive Yuan, he did not reveal this, saying that the local party departments did not make any claims on this major plan. A reporter asked whether he could accept Liang Qiushui's appointment as a member of the State Council. He replied: It can be discussed. Liang Qiushui can come to Shanghai if necessary. It is rumored that Hu's visit to the south this time brought the opinions of the Northern Democratic League. Hu strongly denied this, saying that he had met Zhang Dongsun twice in the north, but it was a long time ago, and he had not seen him recently. What is rumored outside has no basis at all.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th Dispatch] The Communist troops in the Dalian area have now added a special division, with a total of 45,000 troops including the original forces.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan to Continue Discussion on Law of Election and Recall of Legislators Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The draft Law of Election and Recall of Legislators was submitted at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the afternoon of the 28th. The legislators spoke enthusiastically on the issue of the number of seats and electoral districts, and the entire Yuan was filled with dissatisfaction. The meeting will continue on the 29th for the Huanghuagang Memorial, with the aim of completing all work before the 31st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th, the draft Law of Election and Recall of Legislators has begun to be discussed. Members Jian Guansan, Peng Chunshi, and others believed that the population statistics were inaccurate. It was decided to wait for the representative of the Ministry of Interior to attend the meeting on the morning of the 29th to explain before further discussion.</p>
<h3>Law of Election and Recall of the President and Vice President Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The draft Law of Election and Recall of the President and Vice President was also completed by the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the afternoon of the 28th. The full text of the law has only fourteen articles, which is much simpler than the draft Law of Election and Recall of the National Assembly. After the bill was submitted, Liu Kedu, Chairman of the Constitutional Law Committee, explained it first, and then it was discussed article by article. Zhong Tianxin believed that the provision in the fourth article that a presidential candidate must be jointly signed by 50 National Assembly delegates to be nominated was too few, and that dozens of candidates would be generated in the future. He advocated increasing the number to 150. Zhang Zhaoyuan believed that the reason why 50 people were stipulated at the time was to give small parties the opportunity to nominate presidential candidates, because small parties do not have many National Assembly delegates. If the number of co-signers is too large, small parties will have no possibility of nominating presidential candidates. Jian Guansan proposed a compromise, changing 50 people to 150 people. The resolution was amended and passed. When discussing the election method, Wang Changxiang advocated changing to a vote, but other committee members believed that the handwriting of the vote was easy to recognize, and it was easy to write incorrectly. It was resolved to maintain the original plan. Article 9 stipulates that a statement of recall of the President must be signed and sealed by one-quarter of the total number of National Assembly delegates before it can be submitted. Li Qingxun and others believed that one-quarter would reach 750 people, which was too restrictive and would be difficult to submit in the future. It was advocated to change it to one-sixth, which was passed by a vote. The entire bill was formally passed at 5:15 PM.</p>
<h3>The Third Plenary Session Examines and Approves the Full Text of the Economic Reform Plan (Continued from the 27th)</h3>
<p>(5) The Absolute Majority of the Population is Engaged in Agriculture. Agriculture is the backbone of China's economy. Only with developed agriculture, prosperous rural areas, and farmers possessing purchasing power can industry have a foundation and society be stable. Therefore, developing agriculture and promoting rural prosperity are the main objectives of future economic policies. The measures include: 1. Reforming the allocation of agricultural land to ensure its full improvement and utilization. Land tenancy relations should be thoroughly implemented according to the principle of "25% Rent Reduction," and efforts should be made to realize "Land to the Tiller" as much as possible, so that farmers can fully engage in production. 2. Establishing collective farms, utilizing new-style machinery and methods to increase production as a demonstration for farmers, and expanding agricultural experiment and research stations to enhance production technology. 3. In agricultural reform, water conservancy is paramount. The construction of large-scale water conservancy projects and main canals should be actively undertaken by the state. The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and branch canals should be supervised by the central government and handled by the provinces and counties. The issuance of water conservancy bonds should be permitted. Local governments should be responsible for the maintenance of completed projects. 4. Expanding the organization of cooperatives and mutual aid societies to genuinely facilitate agricultural loans and alleviate the pressure of high-interest loans on farmers. 5. Actively and universally establishing a warehousing system to protect the interests of people's production. 6. Widely establishing nurseries, promoting afforestation, and ensuring their growth through effective measures. 7. Utilizing slack farming seasons to train farmers in civil engineering, stonework, and other technologies, and developing rural side occupations to improve farmers' lives. 8. Developing animal husbandry and providing assistance and protection. 9. Encouraging fisheries and protecting their development.</p>
<p>(6) Industry Must Be Self-Sufficient for People's Livelihood. Civil Industry serves as a protection for agriculture, ensuring mutual support and benefit between agriculture and industry. Only then can the foundation of China's economy be established. Therefore, the current development of industry should prioritize civil industries. The government must urgently improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and provide the greatest convenience for industrial loans. At the same time, a comprehensive construction plan should be formulated, defining the scope of state-owned, locally-owned, and privately-owned enterprises, categorized, regionally divided, and clearly stipulated. Implementation should be supervised, and annual production targets should be predetermined, with the government and the people jointly establishing them in phases. The measures include: 1. In the first phase of developing the machinery and chemical industries, efforts should be made to meet the needs of agriculture and forestry, and to solve problems such as water conservancy projects, chemical fertilizers, agricultural tools, granaries, and transportation equipment. 2. Industrial construction should be distributed as much as possible in inland areas where fuel and raw materials are cheaper. 3. If industrial development starts with equipment engineering, some parts should be purchased from abroad, gradually developing into industries capable of manufacturing everything. 4. Except for railways, large-scale hydroelectric power generation, steel plants, and mining industries, which are stipulated to be state-owned or locally-owned, other industries should be encouraged as much as possible to be operated by private individuals in a cooperative manner. 5. Encouraging certain manufacturing enterprises to simultaneously focus on industrial experiments and geological surveys to achieve progress and new inventions. 6. Paying special attention to utilizing slack farming seasons to develop rural handicrafts to meet the needs of both urban and international markets. 7. Developing various mineral resources to meet the needs of industrial development and export goods. 8. The government should gather public and private banks to organize a reconstruction financial company, investing long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and utilize overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in the company to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad. 9. Banks should ensure that loans for industrial and mining enterprises are used for production, and accept fixed assets such as factory buildings and machinery as collateral, without limiting the loan standard to half the value of raw materials and finished products. Unreasonable methods such as pre-deducting interest and arbitrarily charging handling fees to increase the burden of industrial costs should not be allowed. 10. Equipment from factories dismantled in Japan, except for those that must be state-owned, should be handled by various industries responsible for dismantling, transporting, installing, and starting operations. Existing enemy and puppet industrial and mining enterprises that are not easily sold through bidding should be leased to private enterprises. 11. Wages should be reasonable. All provinces and cities should universally implement a wage evaluation system to stabilize production order, with labor and management working together to increase production.</p>
<p>(7) Commerce. A huge excess of imports over exports is a major disease of the national economy. The government should encourage exports through effective methods to gradually balance foreign trade. The measures include: 1. Domestic trade should make full use of the adjustment of financial institutions and the convenience of land, sea, and air transportation to encourage commodity circulation, increase the total volume of national trade, and promote balanced development. 2. In international trade, imports should be strictly limited, except for production tools, raw materials, books, and instruments, to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditure. Trade and financial institutions should be utilized as much as possible to encourage and assist private enterprises. Foreign exchange deposits of Chinese citizens abroad should be implemented quickly in accordance with the emergency economic measures plan. 3. Export businesses should be actively encouraged. The foreign exchange earned can be used with import and export license linkage methods to develop import and export businesses. Consideration should be given to improving and expanding various special products to standardize them for major export goods. Rural handicrafts should also be organized and improved in a cooperative manner and centrally exported to balance the trade surplus. 4. The National Federation of Cooperatives should be responsible for contacting the International Cooperative Trading Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance and wholesale cooperatives in various countries and trying the barter system.

<h3>Draft Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates Amended and Passed by the Legislative Yuan; Number of Delegates from Border Regions and Overseas Chinese Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 28th] The draft law on the election and recall of delegates to the National Assembly, which has drawn attention from all parties, has completed the legislative process after two days of discussion by the Legislative Yuan. After its formal promulgation by the National Government on April 1st, constitutional enthusiasts throughout the country can begin preparations for the elections. The Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th was still presided over by President Sun, with Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioner Chen Shuren also attending to explain. The most intense dispute during the meeting was still the issue of delegate quota allocation. Commissioners Chen Anren, Wang Quansheng, and others requested an increase in the quota for overseas Chinese delegates, while Guang Lu, Wu Yunpeng, and others actively spoke in support of seats for Mongolia and Tibet. Zhong Tianxin believed that the request for increased quotas from border region delegates was a good phenomenon and should be supported, which was overwhelmingly approved by the entire Yuan. As a result, the number of Tibetan delegates was increased from 30 to 40, those elected by various ethnic groups in border areas increased from 10 to 17, and the number of overseas Chinese delegates increased from 57 to 65. During the discussion of the qualifications of electors and candidates, some legislators believed that clauses such as those who had committed crimes of internal rebellion and external aggression under the Criminal Law and those who had been convicted of corruption while serving in public office should be deleted. The debate was particularly fierce, but the original proposal was ultimately maintained. Regarding the limitation on the number of candidates nominated, Liu Kebei believed that requiring the signatures of 100 electors for nomination was too few. Jian Guansan proposed replacing the originally planned supervisory committee system with a chairman elected by everyone. Wang Shizeng cited three reasons to explain why the new method was better than the original proposal: (1) The committee system cannot coexist with the supervisory system, (2) If the Ministry of Interior or the people preside, everything will be entrusted to staff, which is too hasty, (3) All parties should have the opportunity to participate in the constitutional process. A vote was taken on adopting the committee system. When discussing Article 28, Lv Fu believed that it was easy to have opportunistic situations when candidates are elected in order based on the number of votes, based on the legal number of elected quotas. He argued that the method used in France should be emulated, where a second election is held when a majority cannot be obtained. Di Ying and Liu Kejun both believed that this matter was difficult to handle, and it was decided to maintain the original proposal. The discussion on the issue of recall was the most intense, with fierce debate over the number of people required to initiate a recall and the number of times a recall could be initiated. It was decided to delete the statement "If a recall motion is rejected, no further recall may be made against the same delegate during the original term of office." The entire case was discussed at half past four in the afternoon and formally passed while everyone stood at attention. (Full text on page eight of tomorrow's edition)</p>

<h3>Meeting of the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council; Chief of Staff Chen Reports on Military Affairs; Army Reorganization and Construction Continue Actively</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council held its 19th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng reported on the recent military situation. Chen gave a concise explanation of the demobilization, reorganization, construction, and recent military developments of the army over the past year. According to him, the government's administrative policy this year will continue to actively implement the plans for demobilization, reorganization, and construction of the army. In terms of army reorganization, 89 divisions have been reorganized, eliminating a total of 5 corps, 15 divisions, and 180 regiments. The number of personnel serving in military organs, originally more than 730,000, has been reduced to 300,000. If the national army can continue to be reorganized, the number of personnel in military organs can be further reduced. As for the demobilized officers and soldiers, efforts will be made to properly resettle them and engage in production work. Those who wish to retire will be provided with resettlement funds. In terms of army construction, the main tasks are to improve the quality of the army, adjust the military structure, establish a supply system, and establish a naval, land, and air force education system. Other aspects, such as the adjustment of the conscription system, the establishment of military industry, and the construction of barracks and fortresses, are also being implemented step by step. Regarding military affairs, due to the communist troops' deliberate disturbances, the National Army had no choice but to make necessary counterattacks. Yanan in northern Shaanxi has been recovered, and the remnants of the communist troops are fleeing in disarray. More than 10,000 communist troops surrendered in this campaign. It has been discovered that the communist troops in the Northeast have a Korean-Chinese mixed division, which is clear proof of the communist collusion with foreign powers and their lack of military capability. In Shandong, the National Army is actively clearing the Jinpu Railway. In total, over the past year, 130,000 communist troops have surrendered, more than 74,000 have been captured, and a large number of light and heavy weapons have been seized. More than 240 county towns have been recovered by the National Army. After Chen's report, Councilors Xue Mingjian, Yin Shuxian, Su Ting, Luo Heng, Xiang Kuiyi, Qian Gonglai, and Xu Xiaoyan raised questions, which Chief of Staff Chen answered one by one. The main points are as follows: (1) Military discipline will be strictly enforced.

<h3>General Association of Social Welfare Meeting Concludes Successfully Yesterday Afternoon; Madam Chiang Kai-shek Attends and Delivers Encouraging Remarks</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The General Association of Social Welfare Work Conference, which had been held for five consecutive days, concluded successfully at 5:00 PM yesterday. Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, specially attended and delivered a speech yesterday morning accompanied by Dr. Wu Yi-fang. Yesterday's meeting discussed the connection between social welfare organizations in the morning and social welfare administration in the afternoon, passing several motions respectively. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Madam Chiang's Speech: Madam Chiang stated in her speech that social welfare workers in China, if they wish to complete their tasks, should focus on the following points: (1) Moral courage and an upright purpose; (2) Imagination and understanding; (3) Imaginative moral courage. These are essential. However, we must clearly recognize that in Chinese history or in world history, there has never been such large-scale international cooperation. Therefore, it is very difficult to fully meet the expectations of the people. We have been on the road for nine hours, have arrived safely, and appear very tired. However, we have an upright purpose. If we feel that we have made the greatest effort under difficult circumstances, then we can be free from guilt, no matter how the people criticize. External accusations are very easy to incur, because the general public does not understand the difficulties we face.</p>
<p>She also said: I mentioned before that those engaged in social welfare work must have imagination, meaning that we should think for the people and consider how to inform them of our assistance measures. We must have this imagination in order to have great sympathy and understanding for those suffering masses. Finally, I mentioned that in order to complete our task, we must have imagination. Sometimes we are troubled by many obstacles and difficulties, and feel worried and disappointed. But if we pay attention to the long-term goal and make imagination a reality, then all obstacles will become stepping stones to success.</p>
<p>Madam Chiang Kai-shek also cited the example of the fall of the Roman Empire, saying, "Deception and speculation" can often destroy great undertakings. Madam Chiang pointed out: "The huge task before us is how to deal with the social situation so that China can make a positive contribution to the world community."</p>
<p>Motions Passed in the Morning</p>
<p>The motions passed in the morning were: Connection of Welfare Organizations: Provinces without a connection institution should establish one immediately, and those that have already established one should expand it to mobilize the broad social forces. Also, before such liaison committees have actively taken effect, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) and the Ministry of Social Affairs should utilize the experience and assistance of social organizations.</p>
<p>Transfer of Welfare Responsibilities to Permanent Institutions: (1) The implementation of the existing welfare programs of the CRRRA at the central level and the distribution of related materials should be transferred to the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs. (2) The Ministry of Social Affairs should instruct the social affairs bureaus in each province and city to, when necessary, consult with provincial-level liaison institutions to prepare for the completion of CRRRA facilities and hand them over to appropriate public and private institutions for management. (3) Before the end of CRRRA's work, the CRRRA and the General Association should, in consultation with the social affairs bureaus and social organizations of provinces and counties, transfer welfare responsibilities to appropriate institutions.</p>
<p>Sources of Funding for Social Organizations: Each region should launch joint fundraising campaigns, and the government is requested to do its best to encourage local fundraising.</p>
<p>Social Welfare Conference: National or provincial welfare work conferences should be held regularly. The National Promotion Association and its provincial-level similar organizations should be responsible for convening such conferences.</p>

<p>The motions on social welfare administration passed in the afternoon are as follows:</p>
<p>Execution of Resolutions of Social Welfare Work Conferences: (1) When long-term social welfare programs of the CRRRA are transferred, the Ministry of Social Affairs and social affairs bureaus at all levels should strive to earnestly implement the various resolutions of this conference. (2) In the future, when national or international organizations hold any welfare work in China, similar consideration should be given to the various resolutions of this conference. (3) Within two years, the Ministry of Social Affairs and various institutions should convene a conference to discuss social work.</p>
<p>Improvement of Administrative Efficiency: (1) Implement stratified responsibility, strengthen connections, and simplify procedures to enhance administrative efficiency.

If necessary, special meetings will also be convened, and the social affairs bureaus of each province and city should also convene annual meetings and</p>
<p>Transfer of CRRRA's Work: (1) In order to ensure that the work partially or fully assisted by the CRRRA can be transferred in an orderly manner and continued, the CRRRA should immediately consult with the Ministry of Social Affairs to formulate a complete transfer plan. (2) The CRRRA should immediately obtain from each branch office a list of existing relief and welfare materials, as well as the time, cost, and methods required to fully distribute the materials. (3) Various welfare materials and equipment (including office and transportation equipment), as well as a portion of the welfare program, and other materials should be transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the social affairs bureaus of each province and city. (4) The Ministry of Social Affairs and social affairs bureaus should do their best to assist private organizations that cooperate with the CRRRA in promoting welfare programs.</p>
<p>Guidance and Training: Recommendation: (1) The Ministry of Social Affairs should select experienced personnel as soon as possible to promote the on-site guidance system that has already begun in cooperation with foreign experts.</p>
<p>Fundraising: (1) In order to continue to promote the original plan of the General Association, funding sources should be planned to the greatest extent possible according to the scope of work and the national economic situation, or the remaining welfare funds when the General Association ends or is transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs, or the Executive Yuan should allocate sufficient funds in proportion to the increased work of the Ministry of Social Affairs and its bureaus. (2) Provincial-level institutions are responsible for promoting actual business, and the central government should provide practical subsidies. The costs of expert design and on-site guidance should be raised by the Ministry of Social Affairs. (3) Please ask the National Welfare Promotion Association to study the fundraising of social organization business funds, so as to provide host agencies with sources of increased funding.</p>
<p>Chinese Staff: (1) The director of the CRRRA branch office should investigate the qualifications and experience of the social welfare staff under his jurisdiction, select those who are willing to continue serving welfare work and are capable of doing so, and send the list of names and detailed resumes to the social affairs bureaus and social organizations that intend to use them.

<p>Foreign Personnel: (1) This conference recommends to the CRRRA and the General Association to extend the retention of a small number of foreign personnel for six months to assist central and provincial government agencies and social organizations during the transition period. (2) When government agencies and social organizations wish to extend the employment of foreign experts, they should first consult with the Welfare Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Social Affairs so that the selection of personnel in various departments can be properly coordinated.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Revolutionary Youth Today—Commemorating the Huanghuagang Martyrs on Youth Day</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the righteous martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and also Youth Day. In past years, grand commemorative meetings were held in various places, expressing sincere respect and mourning for the martyrdom of the revolutionary martyrs, and giving great and far-reaching encouragement to the efforts and struggles of today's youth. Especially this year, when the country is advancing on the road to constitutional construction after the victory of the War of Resistance, our remembrance of the glorious sacrifice of the martyrs can reassure them of our victory in resisting the brutal Japanese, but also greatly increases our vigilance in the face of the current domestic and international situation; thus, the arrival of this year's Youth Day is of particularly profound significance.</p>
<p>Recalling this day thirty-six years ago, when the corrupt Qing government was wreaking havoc, the people of the country were suffering and groaning under the tyrannical rule of foreign races, although before that righteous men had risen up in various places as many as nine times, unfortunately all were defeated, and the world was in panic. In this time of crisis, relying on the indomitable spirit of the martyrs and their determination to sacrifice themselves for righteousness, under the great leadership of Premier Sun, on March 29th of the Xinhai year, the righteous act of attacking the Liangguang Governor's Office in Guangzhou was launched. With heroic and overwhelming spirit, they fought a bloody battle with Qing officials, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of seventy-one martyrs including Lin Juemin. Although this battle failed to realize the hope of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs was great: fresh red blood bloomed into flowers of freedom, and the seeds of revolution were sown in the vast ranks of the people, thus creating the foundation for the success of the Double Tenth Revolution. The Kuomintang's thirty years of struggle, launching the Northern Expedition, completing unification, resisting aggression, and carrying out the War of Resistance, finally defeating the Japanese invaders, all relied on this revolutionary vitality. Therefore, today's memorial to the revolutionary martyrs must absorb. The reason why the spirit of the martyrs inspires the nation and lasts forever without waning is that these seventy-two young heroes possessed a revolutionary spirit, revolutionary wisdom, and a revolutionary goal of liberating the people and striving for independence, which is a model. The success of the Xinhai Double Tenth Revolution, and the success of the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance that followed, were also continuations of this revolutionary spirit and revolutionary wisdom. Therefore, today's Kuomintang members, striving for national construction and struggling for the future of the new China, should possess the spirit of the martyrs, become more new with the times, continue to nourish the vitality of revolutionary creation, continue to promote the glory of the party, and shoulder the major responsibility of national construction. Therefore, today's commemoration of the revolutionary martyrs should not only be a formal commemoration, but also a spiritual pursuit, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit and wisdom of the martyrs.</p>
<p>The setting of Youth Day on this day is indeed of great significance. First, because the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two young heroes on March 29th of the Xinhai year was a great movement initiated by Chinese youth for national revolution and freedom, their spirit is worthy of emulation, and their wisdom is worthy of learning. Therefore, the meaning of taking "March 29th" as Youth Day is indeed profound. Secondly, the International Youth Conference held in London in November 1942, in order to promote world peace and world youth unity, selected March 21st to 28th as International Youth Week. China is a participating country in the International Youth Conference, and Chinese youth are members of the International Youth, so the Chinese Youth Day is set on March 29th, following closely the development of International Youth Week, and also has world significance. This year's International Youth Week is the "Peace Week" for youths of all countries in the world. Before today, youths of all countries are working for world peace, fighting against the elimination of aggressive thoughts, and working for the happiness of mankind. Chinese youth are not isolated, so in today's commemoration of Youth Day, Chinese youth should recognize the times, cooperate with the actions of international youth, strive for world peace, and oppose the re-harming of world peace by aggressive thoughts. At the same time, for the sake of peace at home, it is necessary to justly denounce those who rely on force and deliberately rebel. This is the era task and the task to the world that revolutionary youth bear.</p>
<p>The history of the Republic of China for thirty-six years is a history full of sorrow. Before the Xinhai Double Tenth Revolution, Chinese youth repeatedly raised the flag of righteousness and shed blood again and again. After the founding of the Republic of China, through the Second Revolution, the anti-Yuan Shikai campaign, the guardianship campaign, and the Northern Expedition launched in the fifteenth year, the country was finally unified in the seventeenth year. As soon as the country was stable, internal and external troubles intensified again. In the twenty-sixth year, the whole country rose up to resist the war, and the Japanese bandits surrendered in the thirty-fourth year. After the victory, the government was preparing for post-war construction, hoping to fulfill the unfinished ambitions of the seventy-two martyrs. Unfortunately, the Communist Party destroyed unity again, so wars continued, people's lives were devastated, and the country had no peaceful days. Today, we respectfully mourn the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs and welcome the great Youth Day. Looking at the present and thinking about the past, we deeply feel an infinitely heavy heart; planning for the future and encouraging the past, we deeply feel an infinitely important responsibility. The current country needs the success of peaceful reunification, the implementation of democratic law, the guarantee of people's livelihoods, and the stability of social order. Therefore, today and after today, in order for our youth to shoulder the great task of national construction and salvation, everyone must restore the state of mind and spirit of the revolutionary party members of thirty-six years ago, rise up to maintain the unity of the country, work hard on various constructions, and create a new China of the Three People's Principles. Only in this way can the Republic of China have a bright and splendid future, and the achievements of the revolution can be preserved for a long time, and the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang will truly be immortal. Only in this way can Chinese youth fulfill their era's responsibility. The cause entrusted to us by the seventy-two young heroes will truly be successful. May our youth encourage each other!</p>

<h3>The Political Atmosphere in Moscow is Gloomy; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Encounters Difficulties; Marshall Denies He Will Return Home Early</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] The end of this week is of a decisive nature for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. All parties are looking forward to the final session. The two major difficulties at present are (1) the issue of German assets in Austria, and (2) the issue of German economic unification. Discussions on the former issue reached a stalemate yesterday and will resume today. Unless a solution can be found today, the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty will be delayed. As for the German peace treaty, after working all night, the Adjustment Committee has almost completed its report, so the Foreign Ministers' Conference can at least touch on the German issue. Although the Foreign Ministers have been discussing for half a month, there is still no sign of a solution. This discussion only allows for a comparison of various opinions. As a result, opinions on economic unification differ greatly. Whether the imminent crisis of the conference can be avoided remains to be seen.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 27th] Observers recently compared the pedestrians on the streets of Moscow with the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, saying that the snow on the streets of Moscow has begun to melt, but there is still no news of spring in the political atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Moscow Radio, 28th: During the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet side has begun a "bargaining" compromise movement, the purpose of which is to attempt to obtain compensation from the current German production, but Britain and the United States still firmly adhere to their original position.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Adjustment Committee finally completed its work of analyzing the points of "agreement" and "disagreement" of the Foreign Ministers at this conference at 10:00 AM this morning (Greenwich time). According to the final draft of the Committee, as of now, the Foreign Ministers have not reached an agreement on every important issue concerning Germany's economy and politics.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 27th, United Press] Marshall's press liaison secretary recently denied the British Broadcasting Corporation's report that Marshall was scheduled to leave the Soviet Union on April 6. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, Marshall told Bevin that he was scheduled to leave the Soviet Union on April 6, but Marshall's secretary denied this. He said that the French delegation is scheduled to hold a reception on April 7, the British delegation is scheduled to hold a reception on the 9th, and the US delegation will hold a reception after the British delegation. It is speculated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference may close in early April.</p>
<h3>The Four Powers Have Major Disputes Over the Disposal of German Assets in Austria; Instructions to the Deputy Foreign Ministers to Establish a Definition</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Moscow Radio, 28th: Molotov proposed an amendment to the definition of German assets in Austria at yesterday's Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to reliable sources, Marshall expressed great dissatisfaction with this and decided to reject it.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 27th] The Soviet Union still demanded the freedom to determine the definition of German funds in Australia at today's Foreign Ministers' Conference. Britain, the United States, and France demanded that the four powers establish the definition of these funds and set up appropriate arbitration institutions to implement arbitration in the event of disputes. Pidu also proposed a three-point resolution, but Molotov immediately proposed an amendment to the resolution. The Foreign Ministers' Conference will continue to discuss the issue of German funds in Austria tomorrow. The Foreign Ministers' Conference also resolved today to reject Yugoslavia's request to present oral opinions to the Foreign Ministers on the report of the Trieste Finance Committee, but allowed Italy and Yugoslavia to submit written opinions. In addition, the Soviet Union also submitted a memorandum announcing its decision to completely destroy all German warships listed in Category "C" in the Three Powers' Agreement on the Distribution of German Navy before August 1947.</p>
<p>The definition of German funds in Austria is the most thorny issue. Today's debate fully exposed the differences in viewpoints between the Soviet Union and the other three countries. Molotov stated that since the British and American governments have announced their abandonment of the right to claim German property in the Soviet zone of Austria, the Soviet authorities have the right to dispose of such property freely. Molotov also believed that the suggestion of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to stipulate specific definitions by the four powers and to implement arbitration in the event of disputes was unnecessary. He believed that only one more clause needed to be added to the treaty guaranteeing the control of such property. Marshall emphasized that the purpose of the Allies was to establish an independent Austria, so that it had appropriate property to maintain its survival. Bevin also said that the Potsdam Conference never decided that property stolen by Germany could also be used as reparations. The proposal put forward by Pidu advocated instructing the representatives of the Foreign Ministers (1) to draft the provisions for the distribution of German property in Austria based on the Potsdam resolution, and to include them in the Austrian Peace Treaty; (2) to establish the definition of German property in Austria, and the property of Wu nationals or United Nations nationals that was forcibly seized by Germany for racial, religious or political reasons should not be included; (3) to draft arbitration clauses based on Article 50 of the Austrian Peace Treaty to resolve disputes. Jiang Luotofu expressed his willingness to accept the first clause, but could not accept the third clause, and proposed to amend the second clause as follows: "The representatives of the Foreign Ministers should establish the definition of German funds in Austria, and the property seized by the Germans by direct violent action, or the property that was conquered without paying compensation to Austrian or United Nations nationals, should not be included." The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference then adjourned to review Molotov's amendments.</p>
<h3>Lai Yi Goes to Norway, Hu Shize Temporarily Assumes Duties [United Press, Chenggong Lake, 27th] United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi flew to Norway today to report to the national parliament.

<p>Trusteeship Council Chinese Representative Advocates [United Press, Chenggong Lake, 27th] The United Nations Trusteeship Council, based on the suggestion of Chinese representative Liu Chuo, adopted in principle today the first procedural regulation, stipulating that regular sessions be convened twice a year. Mr. Liu then urged that the agenda be passed first, so that it could be finally approved during the amendment. Mr. Liu, along with the representatives of Australia and New Zealand, advocated that the Trusteeship Council should determine its meeting dates so that the representatives of all countries can prepare reports and that millions of people who are paying attention to this work can know about its progress. Mr. Liu also said: This move is of great significance, and the regulations can determine the course of the entire trusteeship system, and its importance should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Soviet Refuses UN Interference in German Economy [Reuters, Chenggong Lake, 27th] The Soviet representative today in the United Nations Economic and Social Council opposed allowing the newly established European Economic Commission to interfere in Germany's economy. He believes that the handling of the German economy is the responsibility of the occupying powers. Representatives of Britain, the United States, and France believe that the German economy is closely related to the European economy and should be considered by the European Economic Commission.</p>
<p>US House Passes Income Tax Reduction Bill [United Press, Washington, 27th] The House of Representatives today passed the Republican-proposed income tax reduction bill by a vote of 273 to 137 and sent it to the Senate. The bill stipulates a 30% tax reduction for those with incomes under $1,000 and a 20% tax reduction for those with incomes above $1,000. It will be implemented from January of this year. President Truman opposes the tax cut and may veto the bill. Republican Congressman Engel was the only speaker against the bill, arguing that it gives the largest tax cuts to those who made the most money during the war.</p>
<p>Bevin Resigns from a Concurrent Post, Public Believes British Cabinet Will Be Reorganized Sooner or Later, Government Appoints Key Officials to Implement Economic Plan [Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] It was announced here recently that British Foreign Secretary Bevin has resigned from his concurrent post as Chairman of the Cabinet Manpower Committee. This has no political significance and is purely due to the excessive workload of the Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] People close to Prime Minister Attlee said today that they believe the cabinet may be reorganized "sooner," but they do not attach importance to the rumor that Bevin will resign as Foreign Secretary. At the same time, Labour MPs who oppose the current government's foreign policy insist that the Prime Minister should transfer Bevin to another position to prevent the party's internal division from expanding. These MPs launched opposition to Bevin's policies last autumn. It is said that the government denies any changes to Bevin's position because it does not want to weaken his position in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, but because British foreign policy endangers the survival of socialism, Bevin will inevitably be dismissed sooner or later.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] British Prime Minister Attlee recently declared in the House of Commons that the government has appointed Sir Plowden to implement the British economic plan, which is similar in some respects to France's Monnet Plan. Plowden served as a key official in the Ministry of Aircraft Production during the war.</p>
<p>Italy Formally Joins International Finance [Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Italy today signed the membership agreement of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund here, formally joining the two financial organizations.</p>

<p>Another message: Vishinsky reiterated today that the Soviet Union opposes the economic unification of Germany unless the four powers' control over the Ruhr has been established.</p>
<p>Our Former Deposits in Japan Will Be Repaid in Gold [United Press, Tokyo, 28th] A spokesman for the Civilian Property Administration disclosed today that China, Italy, Vietnam, and Siam, among other Western countries, may receive 73 million grams of Japanese gold, worth US$81.8 million.

<p>Marshall's Meeting Still Not Confirmed [This Newspaper News] London, 28th broadcast: Marshall has been in Moscow for three weeks and has not yet proposed a meeting with Stalin. According to Marshall's advisor, Marshall has no plans to initiate such a meeting at this time. At the same time, although Marshall has discussed with Bidault and Bevin on several occasions outside the conference, he has not had a private conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Most of Marshall's advisors are against him meeting with Stalin, and some people believe that Bevin's request to meet with Stalin was a mistake. It is reported that during the Bevin-Stalin meeting, Stalin suggested providing economic assistance from the Soviet Union to Britain to alleviate the current crisis. American sources believe that Stalin's proposal is intended to win over Britain, but Britain will be in a dilemma of accepting or rejecting it. Marshall hopes to meet with Stalin once before leaving the Soviet Union, but should avoid discussing Truman's new policy.</p>

There were also 4 or 5 residents who were burned and later went to various hospitals for treatment. At No. 67 Yunnan South Road, the basement of the Fuxingzhai Tangyuan shop used kerosene for its stove. Yesterday, ten jin of gasoline were purchased. At around 9:30 pm, the owner, Wu Longyuan (38 years old, from Anhui), was using a scale to check whether the weight was sufficient when the gasoline overflowed and touched the stove fire, causing a sudden fire that could not be controlled. Soon, the handrail of the staircase broke, and six men and women upstairs were burned to death, including the owner's wife, Wu Qiang (35 years old), Wu's daughter, Yin Di (4 years old), Gui (45 years old), niece Wang Wenzhen (8 years old), niece-in-law Wu Wang (21 years old), and old clerk Li Daozhou (21 years old).

The charred bodies were found in the rubble, their faces unrecognizable, looking like black charcoal, a tragic scene. The Songshan Road Police Precinct sent Inspector Ha and police officers to investigate the incident. It was learned that the shop had no back door, resulting in the tragedy.

<p>Subsidies for Eight Major Public Utilities Approved for March, Nineteen Units to Receive a Total of Over 15 Billion, Shanghai Electric Power Company Declares Waiver [This Newspaper News] Shanghai's eight major public utilities, including water, electricity, gas, telephone, tram, city public buses, ferries, and small railways, have recently suffered significant losses. It has now been decided by the central government that prices will not be increased for the time being, and the shortfall in revenue will be subsidized by the government. The total subsidy for March (totaling 15,170,053,700 yuan) has been approved by the Executive Yuan to be allocated in full.</p>
<p>The subsidized units include four in the electricity sector: French, Chinese, Zhabei, and Pudong. There are five in the water sector: Mainland, Zhabei, British, French, and Pudong. There are two in the gas sector: Shanghai and Wusong. There are two in the tram sector: British and French. There are two in the public bus sector: French and municipal. In addition, there are the Shanghai Telephone Company, the municipal ferry company, and the Shangchuan and Shangnan small railways, totaling 19 units. Among them, French companies receive the most because they include four units: electricity, water, tram, and public buses. The US-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company and Huxi Electric Power Company, however, have expressed their disagreement with the government's subsidy policy and have waived the subsidy for March. It has not yet been decided whether to apply for subsidies in April. Yesterday, the Public Utilities Bureau notified the subsidized companies separately and, to avoid difficulties for the companies in receiving funds, has agreed with President Zhang of the Central Bank to have each company open a special account at the Central Bank. Within the monthly subsidy amount, they can withdraw funds from the Central Bank at any time as needed, even before the state treasury funds arrive, and the Central Bank will advance the funds.</p>
<p>Price Adjustments for Four Types of Businesses, including Ferries, Under Review Yesterday, according to Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, the subsidized funds from the state treasury are paid by the majority of citizens. Therefore, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed that the scope of subsidies should be limited to those enjoyed by the majority of citizens. As for small-scale public utilities such as ferries, barges, suburban temporary buses, and long-distance buses, as they are enjoyed by fewer people, reasonable adjustments will still be allowed to maintain operations and avoid increasing the burden on the state treasury. It is reported that the prices for the above four types of businesses, including ferries, barges, suburban temporary buses, and long-distance buses, are scheduled to be adjusted starting in early April, and the amount of adjustment is still under review.</p>

The most important items include Sun Yat-sen's handwritten biography (i.e., autobiography), his handwritten oath, and letters to overseas Chinese and revolutionary comrades. Revolutionary publications such as the Su Bao, Min Bao, Min Hu Bao, Min Yu Bao, and The True Solution of the Chinese Revolution are mostly unique copies in the country.

Zhang Taiyan's manuscript of "Essay on the Martyrs Who Died Since the Year Gui Chou," Chen Ying Shi's military action orders, and Chen Ying Shi's military flag and blood-stained mourning stool are all extremely rare. In particular, the handwritten letters from Huang Xing and Zhao Sheng reporting to their comrades at home and abroad about the failure of the Huanghuagang Uprising are of great historical value. It is reported that to maintain order at the exhibition, a nominal entrance fee of 500 yuan per person will be charged, and detailed catalogs will be printed for visitors' reference.</p>

Seeing this, the court could not bear to continue the questioning and scheduled the case for sentencing on the 31st.</p>

<p>Gang of Outlaws Ravaging the Seas Captured [This Newspaper News] Sun Xinmin, the head of the sand bandits (one of the names for pirates) who claimed to be the commander of a guerrilla force during the Anti-Japanese War, and his accomplices Zhao Jinshan, Liu Hanchen, and 13 others, hid in the Chuansha Chongming area of Pudong after the victory, engaging in business as a cover while continuing to commit murder and robbery at sea. A few months ago, the Transportation Police Headquarters, together with the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, arrested them at No. 3, Zhongnan New Village, Linsen Road. At the same time, the remaining members of the Sun bandit gang, Zhao Jinshan, Liu Hanchen, Liu Yiting, Kong Xianming, Li Maorong, Li Xuexun, Ding Jiapu, Zhang Fuhai, Meng Zhaogui, Zhu Luosheng, Huang Simao, Yu Jinyang, and Zhu Liang Gou, a total of thirteen people, who were robbing on the sea off Chongming Island, were surrounded and captured by Guo Luzhou, captain of the 18th Transportation Police Brigade, Zhang Weibang, captain of the Shengsi District Fishery Protection Police in Jiangsu Province, and the Pudong Inspection Brigade. One carbine, two Thompson submachine guns, two short guns, and a large amount of stolen goods such as salted pork, tung oil, Western medicine, and tea were seized at the scene. After interrogation, the bandits confessed to the following crimes: (1) On the seventh day of the twelfth lunar month last year, they robbed a Shandong boat carrying salted pork off the coast of Chongming Dongyantou, stealing 220 pieces of salted pork, sinking the boat, and detaining the boat owner and 21 passengers. Then, on the sixteenth of the same month, they followed Sun Bandit's orders to use their own sailboat to transport the detainees to the sea off Chongming Island and threw them into the sea to eliminate traces. (2) On the same day, they also intercepted a Shandong boat, stealing 360 pieces of salted pork, capsizing the boat, and sinking all thirteen crew members. (3) On the seventh day of the first lunar month this year, they intercepted a cotton boat off the coast of Chongming, stealing 40 bales of cotton, tea, matches, tung oil, and Western medicine. However, this time they exceptionally released the people and the boat. They then encountered a Jiangbei boat and stole more than 800 pieces of salted pork, then sank the boat again, throwing all sixteen crew members into the sea. In total, as many as 50 people were thrown into the sea and drowned. The case has been transferred by the Transportation Police Headquarters to the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation and reported to Chairman Chiang. It is reported that the Chairman has sent a telegram to Shanghai instructing that the stolen goods should be returned to the owners or their families by the Transportation Police Headquarters and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. If no one claims them within six months, the stolen goods will be sold, and 30% of the proceeds will be used to reward the personnel involved, and the remainder will be turned over to the national treasury. Tao Yishan, director of the Inspection Department of the Headquarters, Zhang Weibang, captain of the Jiangsu Shengsi District Fishery Protection Police, and the personnel involved in the Transportation Police Headquarters and the 18th Transportation Police Brigade have each been commended.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Deposits at China Finance Bank, 200 Silver Dollars Judged to be Worth 500,000 [This Newspaper News] The Civil Court of the High Court announced yesterday the judgment of an appeal case regarding a bank deposit dispute before the war, ordering a payment of 500 times the original amount, creating the lowest record in deposit disputes.

This judgment is provisionally enforceable."</p>
<p>Managers of Four Companies Interrogated in Case of Collusion and Manipulation of Gold, Procedures for Receiving Allotment Gold, Feng Qingan and Others Claim to Have Nothing to Do with Zhan Liansheng [This Newspaper News] The first "gold rush case" after the victory that shocked the national financial community and affected the entire national economy and people's livelihood was heard in court yesterday afternoon. The court summoned Feng Qingan, manager of Yang Qinghe Faji Silver Shop, Ni Zuguang, manager of Fang Jiuxia Changji Silver Shop, Xie Bingquan, manager of Dakangyuan Gold Shop, and Zhang Baiyuan, manager of Dafengheng Gold Shop, to testify. Zhan Liansheng, manager of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, who was in custody, was not brought in for cross-examination. He Qishen, a consultant from the Ministry of Finance specially sent to Shanghai to reinvestigate the "gold rush case," and auditor Fan Shiyu from the Audit Department were present to observe. The audience seats in the Eighth Criminal Court were full. After Judge Wang Jiazuo called the roll, he questioned them one by one in order. According to Feng Qingan, he has no family or business relations with Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, the director and deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Zhan Liansheng. Because Yang Qinghe is an old store with more than 50 years of history and excellent credit, the Central Bank designated it to distribute gold and represent the silver shop industry to receive gold bars from the Central Bank or Tongfengyu Gold Shop, and then distribute them to the industry. When receiving gold, there is no need for Zhan Liansheng to stamp it. The Central Bank sold gold in two ways: open distribution and secret distribution. The price of open distribution was determined daily at 10 am by Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, but the market conditions were provided by the chairmen of the silver shop and gold shop industries. The purpose of secret distribution was to suppress gold prices, and he only did about 40 bars. The court then asked that on January 24 this year, the Central Bank sold a total of 300 gold bars, including 15 bars under the name of Fang Jiuxia, but there were only 10 bars on Fang Jiuxia's account. Since you received allotment gold on behalf of the silver shop industry, you should know. Feng thought for a moment and replied: I don't remember clearly, please ask Fang Jiuxia. He also said: Because our store's overnight funds are not abundant, the application for allotment gold is also uniquely small. Ni Zuguang said that Fang Jiuxia's funds were 12 million yuan. From April to August last year, Fang Jiuxia represented the silver shop industry in receiving gold from the Central Bank. The representative of the gold shop was Zhan Liansheng of Tongfengyu. Open distribution can be received directly, but secret distribution requires Zhan's stamp before it can be received. At the same time, he also said: If the cash is not counted, it can be temporarily owed, but it cannot be owed until the next day, and it must be cleared in the afternoon. As for the difference on the account on January 24, it was probably recorded on the second day's account. Xie Bingquan said that Dakangyuan Gold Shop's funds were 2.4 million yuan at the time of victory. The Central Bank designated the allotment gold, which has nothing to do with Zhan Liansheng. A total of 65 companies applied for the distribution, but only five were designated later. Because he is an old store with more than 30 years of history, the Central Bank trusted him, so he was designated. Zhang Baiyuan said that Tongfengheng was designated by the Central Bank for entrusted distribution, and Zhan Liansheng informed him by phone. Gold was received sometimes from the Central Bank and sometimes from Tongfengyu. The prices of open distribution are the same for all banks, and the commission can be slightly increased during secret distribution.</p>
<p>Five Committees of the Council Re-elect Conveners, Threshold for Banquet Tax Changed from "Pieces" to 10,000 Yuan [This Newspaper News] The Land Administration, Public Works, Education, Finance, and Social Affairs committees of the Municipal Council held meetings separately yesterday afternoon.

<p>Also, the important proposals passed by the committees yesterday include: (1) The Shanghai Western Coffee Industry Association and the Catering Industry Association jointly submitted a proposal stating that the starting point for the banquet tax is no longer applicable to noodles and music equipment halls, etc., and collecting taxes is illegal. It was resolved to change the starting point from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, and the rest of the original decision will be maintained, but it still needs to be approved by the general meeting. (2) The tax on private cars and heavy vehicles should be based on the central government's regulations on the multiple of pre-war taxation. (3) Regarding the issue of handling civilian land used for airport construction, the Land Administration Bureau should first clarify the area of the airport and the land to be enclosed before further discussion. (4) Private primary school principals should enjoy the right to government-distributed daily necessities. It was resolved to ask the municipal government to handle it. (5) Regarding the Executive Yuan's disapproval of converting Hongqiao Airport into an education zone, it was decided to send another telegram to request it. (6) To suggest that the central government and the municipal government reorganize various old debts and determine reasonable repayment methods, it was decided to invite Wang Weisi, Wang Yansong, and Xu Guomao to invite representatives from the financial community to discuss solutions at the Council on the afternoon of April 10.</p>
<p>Xia Zhongming's Case Continues, Denies Persecuting Patriots [This Newspaper News] The case of Xia Zhongming, former Deputy Director of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, suspected of being a traitor, continued in the High Court yesterday afternoon.

All arrests and persecution of underground comrades were done by these two, and he did not participate in any of them. Because there were illegal acts among the secret service personnel, he reported to Li Shiqun and fired many people, fearing that this was the reason for the resentment and accusation. Subsequently, defense lawyer Chen Zhen presented many pieces of evidence favorable to the defendant. The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<h3>Austin Explains at the Security Council the True Meaning of US Aid to Greece and Turkey; Requests Long-Term UN Patrol of Northern Greek Border</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 28th] US Representative Austin delivered a speech today at the United Nations Security Council, requesting long-term UN patrols of the northern Greek border and drafting a far-reaching plan to aid Greece. However, before the United Nations begins to act, the United States must independently aid Greece. Austin also stated that when President Truman requested Congress to allocate $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey to contain communist expansion, it was not limited to just Greece and Turkey. However, Austin's speech did not include words like "communism," nor did it specify which other countries Truman hinted at. Austin continued, stating that the United States upholds the right of all members of the United Nations to choose their own political system, but that this choice must be free and unthreatened, and that these countries must not infringe upon the rights or freedoms of other countries. The United States' aid to Greece, coupled with the long-term UN patrol of the northern Greek border, will certainly promote the realization of peace. The United States hopes that the United Nations will take effective action in threatened areas and that the United Nations will complete a far-reaching plan to aid Greece, but such actions cannot solve the immediate crisis. Austin's speech on Turkey was very brief, only stating that Turkey had repeatedly requested economic aid from the United States in the months before Britain announced that it would have to stop aiding Turkey after the end of March. The United States provided $95 million in lend-lease materials during the war and after its end, but had not subsequently approved this request. During his speech to Congress, Truman stated that military and economic aid must be provided equally to contain communist rule in Greece and Turkey. However, Austin only used the term "totalitarianism" and never mentioned the word "military." It is reported that Truman's plan to allocate $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey to contain communism has caused unease among many United Nations diplomats, forcing the United States to offer an explanation.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 27th] US Representative Austin will deliver a speech at the Security Council on Saturday, clarifying the United States' policy on the Greek and Turkish issues. The speech will be 3,000 words long, and copies of the original manuscript have already been provided to the Soviet Union and other member states of the Security Council for review today, demonstrating its importance. [Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Well-informed sources recently stated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously supports submitting the issue of US aid to Greece and Turkey to a United Nations body for discussion.</p>
<h3>Wallace Opposes Military Aid to Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 27th] Regarding President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey, Henry Wallace, editor of "The New Republic" magazine, recently stated his opinion that US aid to Greece and Turkey should be under the supervision of the United Nations and limited to non-military purposes. Aid to Greece should be of a relief nature and require thorough economic and social reforms in the country. Loans should not be granted to Turkey. Congressional leaders believe that the Senate is more knowledgeable about US foreign policy than the House of Representatives, so they have decided to let the Senate make the decision first. Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is currently urging prompt action, and it is rumored that debate may begin as early as April 7th.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Secret Compromise Between Soviet and France; French Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Denies</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] A spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry denied rumors of a secret agreement between France and the Soviet Union in Moscow, saying that reports that Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister Thadé Terk yesterday told the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee in a closed-door meeting that Stalin suggested a secret agreement between France and the Soviet Union, supporting each other's policies towards Germany, are untrue. There are no proposals for any secret agreements between France and the Soviet Union. It is reported that a spokesperson for the Popular Republican Movement said yesterday that Thadé Terk told the Foreign Affairs Committee that, according to a report by Georges Bidault, Stalin proposed that the Soviet Union support France's claims to the Saar region in exchange for France's support of the Soviet Union's plan for Germany, including establishing a centralized German government and increasing copper and iron production for reparations.</p>
<h3>Patterson Tells House Foreign Affairs Committee That Large Numbers of Soviet Troops are Assembled on the Turkish Border; Aid to Greece and Turkey Can Avert War</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Secretary of War Patterson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is discussing President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey, that a large number of Soviet troops are now concentrated on the Turkish border. He personally believes that aiding Greece and Turkey is more likely to prevent war than to promote it. One committee member asked, "Assuming our goal is to prevent Soviet aggression, could the funds requested in this case be used more effectively elsewhere?" Patterson signed, "That region (Greece and Turkey) is of extreme strategic importance, and the money spent there will certainly not be wasted." Another committee member suggested that the United States consider "guaranteeing Turkey's borders." Patterson said that he felt this step would not be as effective as the financial aid plan. Patterson also said that the US government's intelligence on Turkish military equipment is not as detailed as that on Greece, but that the number of military personnel the United States plans to send to Greece is limited to only ten to forty people. Republican Congressman Munt suggested limiting the number of military personnel sent to each country to one hundred, which Patterson said he would not oppose. Another committee member asked about the strength of Soviet forces on the Turkish border, to which Patterson replied that the strength was considerable. The committee member also asked if the Soviet Union had any intention of moving into Turkey. Patterson said that the congressman's judgment was as good as his. Patterson also said that the Greek army uses British equipment, so parts should continue to be purchased from Britain.</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Grant Surplus Materials Worth One Million Pounds to Greece; Two Countries Have Formally Signed an Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 28th] The British Foreign Office announced on the 28th that Britain and Greece have reached an agreement in which Britain will transfer surplus materials from the British Army and Air Force worth one million pounds to Greece, most of which are for civilian use. The transferred materials do not include weapons. The agreement on the 28th is only the formal implementation of the principles of the previously concluded agreement.</p>
