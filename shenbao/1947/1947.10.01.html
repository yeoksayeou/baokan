<p>，預定一日即可全部到達。聞此批艦</p>

<h3>美陸軍部提出計劃　助我練新軍十師　俟華府批准後即可實施</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京卅日電〕權威方面稱：美陸軍部爲答覆蔣主席美軍是否可協助訓練國軍之要求</p>
<p>，已提出一訓練，配備及接濟十師國軍之計劃。孫立人將軍已在台灣建立一訓練校，一　華</p>
<p>府對此計劃批准後，即可予以實施。</p>
<p>傳美陸軍部會告蔣主席稱：十師美式訓練軍隊可使國君制止共軍及控制所有重要地區。據古</p>
<p>計，此一計劃須費時一年可完成，雖十師軍隊不足「消滅」共軍，但十萬人員必能防止共軍對</p>
<p>中國經濟及政治復興之嚴重千擾。據悉：此一計劃將與魏德邁之報告同時在華府發表。</p>
<p>根據此一計劃，每一師團須受三個月訓練，蓋每一師團已有若干戰鬥經驗。其後每師實力于</p>
<p>以提至一萬五千人，幷調赴後方，再經三個月之嚴格訓練，由美敎官訓練美式武器之使用，一</p>
<p>俟訓練完畢後，配以美國武器，調往前綫作戰。</p>
<p>建議中計劃之主要程序之一，指導由空軍運輸及給養此項軍隊。美陸軍顧問曾申言，中國</p>
<p>政府與共軍作戰，最需要者厥爲遝輸機，並不是戰鬥機，故不應以重武器，而應以輕武器給予</p>
<p>中國，蓋彼等相信：國軍在東北之缺點，爲共軍之流動性較大，職是之故，國軍並不需要重砲</p>
<p>·巨型坦　車以及大型卡車，蓋中國之地形皆爲崎嶇小路及稻田，故需要輕運輸工具。</p>
<p>該方未說明關於實行此訓練計劃之美軍軍事顧問團需要多少人，但信，將予以大量擴充，蓋</p>
<p>目前駐華美軍官約僅四百人，其中百分之廿五係屬行政工作。</p>
<p>據悉：美陸軍官員相信，訓練人員至少應普遍至每營皆有，以保證此一計劇能獲得成功。</p>

<h3>對於商業登記法草案的意見</h3>
<p>經濟部擬重訂商業登記法，其草案重點及條文大綱業載本報。査現行法係於廿六年六月廿八日公佈施行，其施行細則則於廿七年五月十九日公佈施行；事隔十年，客觀條件諸多變更，且衡其內容，先天上即有許多欠缺之處，自應加以及時的修正。</p>
<p>此項草案，據聞曾經社會·經濟·財政·司法等部共同審査，一致認爲「甚爲切要，均表贊同」。我們亦認爲後法確勝前法，其中頗多優點，尤以加入外國人經營之商業一章最爲應時。不過綜觀全文，尚待商榷與補正的地方，也還不少。試爲分別列舉，用備參酌。</p>
<p>商業範國不採用列舉法。現行法第三條列舉十六種營業，稱爲商業，非但多所掛漏，而且所分種類，亦　過於　統，自不如改用定義式的規定，較爲乾凈。但第四條亦有補充，視爲商業，」則實際上並無出入，惟重訂草案在形式上較爲簡括而已。</p>
<p>現行法第廿一條規定：「在同一縣市，不得用他人已登記之商號名構，爲同一營業之登記。」此在取案，未見有何歧異。良以商業登記之目的，端在於商號權之保護，這是舉辦商業登記之精神所在，自無所用其變更。其問題乃在同一營業這一點上，即何者謂之同一營業，何者不得謂之同一營業？道却與是否列舉，大有關係了。就上海而論，因為商業特別繁盛。分業特別詳細，所分的十六種商業，實際上早已不適用，而有許多商業，其營業對象，又往往分屬於兩個乃至兩購個以上之行業，同時即分屬於兩個乃至兩個以上之同業公會。例如工業原料，當然是化工原料業所經營的，而西藥行却亦兼營此業，國產顏料亦有一部份是這一類貨物，於是困難問題便發生了。如果說牠是同一營業，則他們振振有詞，辯稱；乃原屬兩個行業，兩個公會，不承認是同一營業，因而使用他人已登記的商號並不算違法。但如准其使用，則其所經營的，至少一部份是工業原料，實際即是同一營業。這個問題，現行法未解決，草案亦仍未解決。我們認爲商業分類的列舉，確實在其必要。但如由中央來統一規定，則各地情形不同，難免削足適歷，多所杆格，似不如授機各地主管官應、按照當地實際情形，愼重斟酌，報部核定，較爲妥善。</p>
<p>同一名稱商號的登記問迎。　事實上自有許多商號，於有意無意間，使用他人同一的名稱，如陸稿　，老大房，張小泉之類，其例不勝枚舉。施行細則第卅四條規定：一他人登記前業經使川之商號，不受本法第廿一·廿二條之限制；但須有創設在前之證明」。這可算解決了一部份的爭執。又以同一縣市，同一名稱的事實太多，前條辦法，不够應付，於是又由部令補充了一個辦法，即許多同一名稱的商號，如果互相同意，具書證明，概許呈請登記，這可造成了糾紛了。因爲已經登記的，和資格較老的，往往不肯具書證明，其已加入公會爲會員的，尤其不肯爲未入會的非會員證明，這問題使無法解決。而草案於此，並未觸及，這顯然是一價大缺點。</p>
<p>舊習慣本有加記的辦法，却爲現行法令所不許；其實遷就事實，要不失爲一折衷之道。例如上文所舉陸稿荐之類，如果原已創設在前，即准許加記，分別准予登記，似比互相同意證明的辦法較爲便利。</p>
<p>還有一類特殊的事實，即祖傳下來的老商號，如果營業發展，由其弟兄　於互相同意或先人遺囑之下，沿用同一牌號，各自營業；在這種塲合，如許其加記登記，於情於理，似都狠說得過去。但在現行法下，此路却反而走不通。</p>
<p>一個商業使用數個商號名稱。　就是一家總店，分設了幾處營業，雖使用了好幾個名稱，其資本部並有分割。這種孳生出來的商號，如果分別准予登記，則無資本額可塡，其條件未曾具備；如果不准登記，則此類商號機，便無從取得法律上的保障。而現行法以無明文規定，主管官應一概予以批駁，未知草案對此，有無補救？</p>
<p>登記的限制。　施行細則第六條：「依本法第四條，視爲商業之營業，以不背於公共秩序，善良風俗者爲限」。照此規定，凡是不背於公共秩序和善良風俗的，祇須手續完備，自可一概准予登記，原沒有其他任何限制。但是按餚現實，確也有許多不得不酌予限制的。　例如某稱貨物，實行平價配售時，往往有許多投機商號如雲而起，大家獵取暴利。如果一概准予登記，不靑獎勵投機，擾亂市面；不許登記。於法何機？上項條文，是否足够爲拒絕登記之依據？草案對此，有何補充？</p>
<p>登記的强制。現行法原採自由登記制度，並沒有任何條文堪資爲强制登記之依據。現行的强制登記辦法，係根據卅二年的部令，即是以命令變更法律，在法律上原有問題。草案改採强制主義，可以補救上項的缺陷，在立法上亦算一種進步。所可商討的，是這種措置，在事實上究竟是否必要？於公於私，究竟有何意義？上文說過：商業登記原是以商號權之保護爲目的。那麼，商人自己不需要這種保護時，他們原可以自由裁量，不需要加以强迫。草案說明：「改爲强制登記主義，使政府對於商業，能利用登記制度，而予以合理之管理，使趨正常發展。」其旨趣固如此。但我們很懷疑：商號是否必須登記了，政府才可以管理？才可以使趨正常發展？不登記時，便不能達到上述的目的嗎？舉事賞來爲證，現在政府的管理辦法，無過於限價，議價，取締投機國積等等，那就要問：是否不登記的，可以不遵守此等法令？政府要實施此等法令時，是否對於已登記的上好有按圖索駿，先行檢查的必要？假如上文所說，一般投機商號，琅得了登記資格，便可由請配售，那麽，强制登記了，是否倒反使宜了他們，使他們可以依法獵取暴利？如果爲防止上項流弊起見，可以酌加限制，則在現行的自由登記主義之下，已無足夠的條文堪資引用，何況於強制登記以後？</p>
<p>上文一再說過：商業登記的目的，無非爲保護其商號權，至於是項商業是否可以合法經營，有許多種尚待主管事業機關之核准，例如必須領得種稱牌照，執照等。但許多商人，知識知潛，往往誤登記爲營業之核准，讓登記證爲牌照或執報，他們認爲政府旣經許可登記，便可自由營業，以至引起了許多麻煩。其明文事理的，亦為嘗不以分別申請，多費手續爲多事。所以就事論事，改採强制登記這辦法，實際上乃是多餘。</p>
<p>他若創設登記費，定爲照資本額收千分之一，這比上海現行的費率增加了一倍，也未免加重高人的負擔。又草案附則規定：在新法施行前，已依現行法所爲之登記，雖與照新法所爲之登記，有同一效力，但原登記事項，依照新法有不符或缺少者，應於一年內聲請變更登記。照此辦理，賞際上，又須使商人重做一套手續。我們認爲：這都是可已而不已之事，可省而不省的工作。</p>
<p>經濟部公佈是項草案，意在徵求公私法人意見後，再提出政務會議討論。我們希望，以上所陳各點，還有斟酌補救的餘地。又部方所公佈的，原祇是草案的要點，並非全文，我們更希望，上面所陳種種缺點，或統統規定在內了。</p>

<h3>聯大批準巴基斯坦奮鬥　正式加入聯合國　安理會非常任理事改選　五軸心附庸國入會案仍未有所決定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三十日廣播：成功湖訊，由於美蘇兩國之一致支持，捷克之被選爲安理會非常任理事國，殆已不成問題，惟捷克本身殊不願担任此項重要任務，良以在此東西衝突方興未艾之際欲求應付得當，實非易事故也。捷克除由美蘇兩國贊成外，中國，英國及拉丁美洲二十國亦表贊成，法國亦有採取同一態度之可能。安理會其他兩非常任理事國，阿根延與加拿大當選殊有把握。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約三十日電〕聯大會今日除討論批准巴基斯坦與葉門兩國加入聯合國機構外，並將辦理安理會三理事國改選事宜。據外交界預測，捷古本身雖殊不願，料將被選爲安理會理事，否則蘇聯在該會勢必陷於孤立。</p>
<p>〔路透社成功湖三十日電〕聯合國今日之全體大會，將選舉安理會因巴任磷所世之一席理事。在四十八小時前，一般咸信阿根廷在美洲國家之有力支持下，可望當選，然至選舉前夕，形勢突變。拉丁美洲國家因不滿貝隆政權及阿根廷之不顧上屆聯大決議，拒不召冋其駐西班牙之大使，已準備選舉烏拉圭。此項選舉定今日標準時間下午四時舉行。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿九日電〕安理會今繼續討論義匈保羅芬蘭申請獲得聯合會員國籍案，惟對任一申請案，均未獲得正式決定。美英代表宣稱，不支持匈羅之申請，蓋該兩國之現政府對於民權及基本自由加以壓迫。蘇聯亦明白表示，倘安理會對於匈保羅芬四國之申請，作不利之決定，蘇聯亦將否決義國之申請。英國斥蘇聯之立塲，爲試圖作「不正當之交易」，澳比亦責其聲明與聯合國憲章精神不合，蓋憲章規定對於每一申請案，應依照其本身之得常與否而決定。</p>
<h3>巴基斯坦代表　首次發表演說　願協力促進國際有利合作</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗魯辛草地三十日電〕巴某斯坦首席代表克漢，今日在聯大曾准許巴基斯坦正式加入聯合國爲會員之儀式中發表演說，對於列强之未能協議，曾表示不滿。渠云，二次世界大戰結束已有兩年，而世界仍在覓取和平中，且有不易抓得之勢。黨集中其資源及智力以獲得戰爭勝利之各大國，對於和平的基礎，似竟不能成立坦白　誠的協議。余謹代表我政府向聯合國機構保證巴基斯坦之決將盡其力量，以促成國與國間更佳的諒解，獲致並維護持久的和平。渠繼云，就實際上言，巴基斯坦乃印度之一部，而後者固曾爲凡爾賽和約之簽字國，亦爲國聯之創立國。故巴基斯坦並非聯合國之新會員，而爲一創立國之繼承者。巴某斯坦之參加聯合國，雖僅爲形式上之程序，但吾人認爲此乃表示巴茶斯坦之信任聯合國之主義。</p>

<h3>杜魯門敦促國會援歐　范登堡首先響應　決即召開參院外交委會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約卅日廣播：華盛頓訊，參議員范登堡將於十一月十日召開參院外交委員會，考慮緊急援歐問題。范氏稱：當前之問題，實爲人類能否繼續自由生存之間題，杜魯門所建議之救濟歐洲計劃，與馬歇爾計劃有別，但兩者之間具有種種相同之因素，僅緩念稍有不同耳。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿九日電〕杜魯門總統今日呼籲國會諸領袖推動援歐計劃，但稱召開國會特別會議問題尚待決定。總統與國會諸領袖在白宮舉行會議後，即匆匆召集記者團，發表聲明如下：　渠已請參衆兩院度支及外交委員會儘速會議，討論援助西歐迫切需要。　各委員會如一致贊成召開國會特別會議，則召開自無問題。無論如何，渠立塲不變，即在必要時將召集之。</p>
<p>援歐欵項　瞬將告竭</p>
<p>現有援歐款項，僅可支持至十二月一日，且爲最低數目，此後援助款項即將告罄。　明年三月三十一日以前，須續撥五億八千萬元，以接濟法義奧三國，此數亦已少至不能再少。渠不能用任何行政權力撥發此款。　目前英國情形，似不若上述三國之嚴重。總統並答復某記者問稱：比利時與荷蘭過去能自力應付其需要，今後似仍能爲之。</p>
<h3>埃及等三國建議　禁猶人移入聖地</h3>
<p>（本報訊）紐約三十日廣播：成功湖訊，今日埃及·伊拉克·及黎巴嫩等三國突向聯大提出建議，主張禁止猶太移民繼續進入巴勒斯坦。此三個國家認爲移民之繼續進入，足以擾亂國際間之友好關係。該項建議之提出，適在截止期限之前，過期之後，即不能要求將新議案列入議程矣。</p>
<p>法義二國　危機最迫</p>
<p>（合衆社華盛頓卅日電）杜魯門總統與國會領袖會商時，曾公開其隱憂稱，除非法國及義大利能自美國得到緊急援助，否則將爲共產主義所呑噬。然在先期取得擁護其計劃之保證前，召開國會實屬勞而無功。國會領袖懷疑參衆二院之撥款及外交委員會能否在十二月一日前完成必需之硏究，蓋各委員現下散處各地，多人在歐洲親自考察，彼等能否在十二月十五日前被召回，尚屬疑問。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿九日電〕據參與白宮會談各議員談稱：杜魯門並未能獲得共和黨領袖肯定的支持。</p>
<p>馬卿曾作　詳細報告</p>
<p>民主黨參議員魯加斯稱白宮會議中曾由正副國務卿馬歇爾及洛維德詳細報告歐洲經濟局勢。衆院共和黨領袖哈萊克則力言共和黨在今日之會議中，並未接受任何特定的協定。馬歇爾繼各議員後出白宮，精神似頗興奮，但渠對記者之一切問題，均拒絕作答。</p>
<h3>英內閣局部改組　克里浦斯任經濟部大臣　格林伍特退休由莫理遜繼替</h3>
<p>（路逐社倫敦廿九日電）艾總禮首相於今日午夜宣布任命商相顆粒浦斯爲新設經濟事務部大臣，調國外貿易大臣威爾遜繼任商務大臣。唐寗街十號同時並宣布不管部大臣格林伍特之辭職，克里浦斯當接替樞密大臣莫理遜前此所擔任之指揮國內經濟政策之責任。</p>
<p>經濟事務大臣下，僅有少數幕僚，在工作方面將由原有之中央計經濟設局，經濟情報處，內閣秘書處經濟科等輔佐之。此外將另設內閣經濟設計委員會，由艾德禮苜相親任主席，處理國內外經濟政策之重大問題。關於格林伍特之辭職，乃文德禮首相欲以少壯派參加內閣，以替年逼閣員之結果。格林伍特所遣不管部大臣一職，將由莫理遜繼任。其他閣員之更動，包括若干年逼閣員之退休，週末當可宣布。</p>
<p>據本社政治記者稱，克里浦斯出任經濟事務大臣，負經濟政策統一指揮之責，有權對商務，供應，勞工，燃　，常力及運輸等部，實施監督管制，渠並將與財相道爾頓密切合作，但與財相爲平行職位。迄至目前爲止，英國之經濟設計，係由兩個委負會負責，其中負責國內經濟者，由莫理遜主持，負責國外經濟者由艾德禮親自主持。今後此兩委會技術上仍由艾德禮主持，而實際上通常均由克里浦斯主持，貝文外相亦將加入爲設計委會之委員。</p>
<h3>蘇作家文侮辱杜魯門　美對蘇提出抗議　莫洛托夫已予率直駁覆</h3>
<p>〔聯合社業盛頓廿九日電〕國務部今日宣布：蘇聯某作家撰文侮辱杜魯門總統，以總統與希特勒相比擬，美國提出抗議，已被蘇聯政府駁回。該文稱杜魯門爭取慕尼黑伍長（指希特勒）之桂冠，並代表垣街財　，從事一制　世界」運動。該文並譏杜魯門爲「信差，銀行夥計，及貪汚黨之工具」。</p>
<p>美國向蘇抗議係駐蘇大使史密斯提出，謂美國人民不問政見如何，對於此種誹謗，深以爲憾。蘇外長莫洛托夫復文稱，蘇聯政府對於此種文字，不能負責，更不能接受閣下所提出之抗議。</p>
<h3>麥帥指令煤炭增產　日閣擬就具體辦法　五年後擬年產四千萬噸</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京三十日電〕接受麥帥總部關於煤炭增產指示之日本政府，於本日閣議上，會協議具體化方策，結果決定：　禁止生產者暗中直接售與消費者；　煤炭價格不擬變更；　對能率優良之生產者，特別配以物資，以資鼔勵；　勞動時間採用二十四小時三交替制。</p>
<p>此外勞動省主張减免由生產增產之勤勞所得稅之增加部份，而使企業者負担之，但商工省則反對由企業者負抵，而主張免稅，此項意見不能爲大藏省所接受，乃決定延至下次閣議，再行協議。又商相水谷就麥帥總部之指令談稱：一九五二年之產量以四千萬噸爲目標，每年增產二三百萬噸，但爲增加煤產，則國家管理殊爲必要，其理由如下：　計劃生產實屬必需；　可深知實際情况；　政策興實際情形可獲一致，物資之配給及勞動力之配置亦可圓滑。</p>

<h3>信用合作社不發支票　即喪失其存在之特性　余楠秋蔣建白普京訴願</h3>
<p>上海市各信用合作社，昨集議對報載財政部不准信用合作社發行支票一節，一致表示反對，時推派代表余楠秋·蔣建白赴京交涉及準備行政訴願，據蔣建白談：信用合作社依法得發行支票，査：　合作社法第三條第四款「信用合作社爲謀金融之流通，貸放生產上或製造上必要之資金於社員，並收受社員之存款」。</p>
<p>銀行法第二條「本法稱銀行業務爲左列各款：（1）收受各種存款，（2）……（3）辦理各種放款……，參照以上兩法之規定，足證信用合作社爲法定經　銀錢業務者，僅信用合作社之銀錢業務限於所屬之社員而已，其爲銀錢業之身份，則已完全確定。　銀行法第十八條規定「凡以收存貨幣或款項爲常業者，不論其收存方法爲給予支票或存單或收據或簿摺或期票或其他類似之證明文件，均視爲銀行業務」，則支票存單收據簿摺期票均視爲銀行業務，即使信用合作社不用支票，亦必須用存單簿摺等，亦仍爲銀行業務，故無論如何解釋，均不能否認信用合作社爲銀錢業者，旣爲銀錢業者，自可發行支票。　信用合作社發行支票，有關合作社法·銀行法·票據法三種，財部不能不顧信用合作社所根據之合作社法，而遽認信用合作社爲非銀錢業，不能發行支票，况支票爲現代金融流通之重要工具，金融信用愈大，則支票之使用愈廣，而愈有其必要性。如信用合作社不能發行支票，則信用合作社即喪失其存在之特性，而合作社法對設立信用合作社之規定，豈非形同具文云云。</p>

<p>光陰消逝得　快，四十天一轉瞬就過去了，「讀者助學金」微募捐款的限期終於屆臨，但是審核和頒發的工作還將繼續一個相當的時期，同時也得檢討過去的成績，作爲未來的借鏡。</p>

<h3>參議大會休會　·一月後在續開·　參議員意見分歧　哈同花園案保留</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會此次第四次大會舉行會議七日，已於昨晚八時休會。休會一月後將舉行延會，主要工作爲審核三十七年度本市預算。至此次大會朱及討論與決議案件，如不甚重要而有時間性者，則先行交有關各機關辦理，俟延會時追認。如麗重要而無時間性者，則留待延會時討論。</p>
<p>昨日大會第七次會議討論提案，最熱烈者爲徵借哈同花園改關公園問題。關於該提案，可分二部分，一爲市長交議「大衛喬治哈同呈捐不動產先行函請審議見復案」。另一爲方如升等五十八參議員所提「征用該園爲本市永久之公園案」。參議員對此案意見分歧。首由張迺作代表四小組說明徵借理由，謂：　根據國家土地政策，私人實不應有有如此寬大花園。　土地法第二○八條規定，凡國家因交通事業，公用事業，公共衛生等之需要，得依本法之規定征收私有土地。　征用哈同花園，費用少，成功易。該園佔地一百七十畝，僅需一百二十億元。路式導繼稱，市參議會對本案不應貿然負責，　哈同夫人遺囑究竟如何說法，本曾尚未看到。　假如喬治哈同捐捐十五畝後，是否不再向其微借。吳正矱反對全部徵收，謂土地法上雖有規定，但應注意「應以其事業所必需者爲限」一點。徵收哈同花園是否「必需」？鄧傳　贊成以十五畝地設一圖書館。姜毫建議將處理辦法保留。最後</p>
<p>市長解釋</p>
<p>稱，市府爲執行參議員決議案，會興喬治哈同商議，但對方旣不肯出租，本人不得不向市參議會報告請決定。本人認爲　治哈同既願捐地，且自動建造圖書館，市府可謂毫不費力，故可集中力量以交涉徵收跑馬廳，實於吾人更爲有利。後潘議長袖充報告謂，本會始終未通過「徵借」之決議案，第一次大會決議爲「租借」，第三次大會係提案。案由中有「微借」二字，但決議爲照第一次大會決議。結果，經大會付表決，對市長交議及議員臨時提案一概「保留」。</p>
<p>遴選敎局長案保留　市立師專再遭抨擊</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕參議會昨日又討論臨時提案數件，陳伯良陳保泰等提「請市長迅即　選本市敎育局長以改進本市敎育案」，據陳伯良說明理由，謂二年來本市敎育行政異常忽略，請市畏迅即遴選德高望重富有敎育行政經騐之人士充任。</p>
<p>陳保泰除提及此案外，復提交證據再度揭發市立師專虛報學生名額班級　事，態度相當激昂。後吳市長說明關於敎育局長任命事，應由行政院交敎育部辦理。至檢舉貪汚，市府有責任辦理，如能查實，保證澈底嚴辦。對本提案則請撤銷。</p>
<p>李代敎育局長　謀承認二年來本市敎育確有弊病，但謂，有若干事件，不能將責任全推之於敎育局，本人對於新局長之職，絕不競爭。末對於市立師專一案，再三說明董任堅校長並無貪汚行爲。</p>
<p>最後決議：對陳伯良所提案予以「保留」，對市立師專案則送請市府査明依法嚴辦。</p>
<p>汽油加油辦法通過　今日起先試辦一月</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕汽車加油辦法於昨日上午由參議會公用小組及下午大會修正通過如下，決自今日起先行試辦一個月：　各種機動車輛每次加油必須加入油箱，至多每三天加油一次，或每月加汕十次。機器脚踏車每次加油不得超過一介侖，小汽車每次加油不得超過十介侖，貨車每次加油不得超過二十介侖，貨車及營業汽車用油數量如有不足時，車商得根據實際情况申敍事實，經同業公會證明，呈請公用局另組委員會詳加審核。加油站及　駛人等如有囤積汽油及黑市買賣行爲，除立即停止供應外，視情節輕重送法院究辦。</p>

<p>又通過臨時動議案　陸蔭初等提「請對本市志願兵以精神上，物質上之援助，以資勸勉」案。　陶百川等提請函市政府迅速切實執行中央最近頒布之處置後方共黨辦法以　亂　而安地方案。</p>

<h3>常州破獲奸匪秘密機關　密室重疊·啟閉自如·彷彿紅蓮寺　鷄籠內檢出大宗文件·現正按圖索驥</h3>
<p>〔本報武進廿八日訊〕本邑東鄕六區區長　潔，最近率同自衛隊員在該區小留鄉孫文軒家，破獲奸匪秘密機關一所，情簡曲折，一如傳奇中之紅　寺，茲將經過情形記述如下：</p>
<p>緣該區平日匪患不靖，同是為匪偽武南留守處主任陸道南經常出沒駐地。區公所最近據密報及眼綫，得悉小留鄕孫文軒家有窩廠匪偽情事，當於本月廿五日夜十二時親率自衛中隊部暨特務人員廿餘人，武裝按址馳赴小留鄕住基上村，其時村民盡入睡鄕，即不動聲色，將屋內佃農禁閉一室，進屋四處搜查，該屋內僅住有老翁一人，名孫貴富，年已七旬，眼花耳聾，餘悉為佃農。房屋一大所，十餘間，布置曲折，經查一小時久，了無可疑痕跡，漸至廚房下，發見內有側門一所，啓之則通小弄，咫尺間有　室一，雙房緊鎖，破　入，室內床櫉俱全，旋從床後發覺密室，啓閉機關繩索一根，牆上置有類似門窗木板一條，用力拉啓，僅可容一人進出。室內漆黑無光，僅一床一凳，床帳用全紅色。加以搜査，獲得縱火用物及槍彈等物。並檢用組索收　，密室門板，可啓閉自如，一如紅運寺中之靈活機關。至午夜三時，遂傳喚當地保甲長，鄕民大半從夢中驚醒，齊來一覘，咸表驚奇不置。廿六日，復加派人員將室內所有傢具，盡行搬掛，逐一檢査，當於一鷄籠內，檢得大宗秘密文件，及大批徵收公糧名册單據，另有抗幣，步槍子彈等物甚多，據傳屋內尚有秘密地窖一處，內　軍用品槍械甚多，區公所正按圖索驥，廿七，廿八日尚在繼續搜査中。</p>
<h3>巡視杭州灣</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿九日訊〕一個偶然的機會，記者和田漢洪先生得識交通部公路總局第一區局杭州工程處長徐匯濬先生，又承他的介紹，認識了第一區局長梁强，公路總局技正程璘，區局主任工程師陳祖鈞，工程科長彭樹德，工程師賴子述諸先生，他們要去視察整個杭州灣的公路，田漢先生首先願意參加這個旅行，記者也被邀加入。</p>
<p>公路總局第一區局是掌管蘇，浙，皖三省的公路，南京，上海，杭州間的公路交通，全仗他們的努力。杭州灣正常在滬杭公路上的金絲娘橋起，經乍浦，海　，海寗，杭州，蕭山，紹興，百官，而至觀海衛。翻開中華民國的地圖來，齊巧在這瓣秋海棠葉東端下面一隻小小缺角的邊緣。這就是中山先生計劃中的東方大港，敵人——日本侵入華東，華中最先的缺口，也是民間商運的吐納地。我們先從杭州出發</p>
<p>過錢江大橋</p>
<p>經蕭山到紹興。錢江大橋的汽車道，有兩節是以林來塡補的，富有經驗六十一歲高齡的梁強局長，他認爲應該多加柏油塗漆，以免陷於毀壞。我們走的是蕭山舊道，有一些頭　。過蕭山後，路就比較平坦得多，蕭紹公路原本是有名的良好公路，可是橋樑還都是臨時用木做的。在路上時，我們看見農胞們還是爬在水車上踏着，把水灌到他們的田裏去，我再看看乾渴的田禾，再看看並着公各的一條河，像這樣的環境，田禾應該得救的，可是因爲人力供應不够，需水太多的緣故，這些稻禾的收成也不會怎麽好。現在紹興正在修石縴塘，是便利舟楫拉縴的。到了紹興以後，記者曾和田先生二人對古越城加以訪問。</p>
<p>紹興三名產　　之一，錫箔，走私之風還是很熾，不由車上帶，便由船上帶，眞是防不勝防。據說這些走私的人大半都是穿軍服的。另一名產，老酒，近來因爲酒稅重，製造的比較少了，又因爲各地都有紹興人製紹酒，所以外銷也受了影響。再談淡水魚，近來是比較淡月，到冬天和春天，才是興旺的時期。田先生和記老在街上巡禮一番，竭力像追尋古寶一樣，想看一看從前曾經臥薪嘗胆的越王　踪，也想看一看這人才輩出的名域，看一看大敎育家蔡元培先生和大文豪魯迅先生的故里。在街上，僅有幾家小書店，裏邊的書不算多，想買一些土產，除了香糕以外，其餘一無可買，許多物品都是外來的，價錢要比上海杭州貴。著名的越劇，這裏却比不上上海的演技。曾去東湖遊玩，田先生搶着要划船，這種船的底很窄，是用手脚並划的，一不小心，就要翻，聽說東湖很深，幸虧他技術高明，遊了陶公洞，復遊仙桃洞，雖然多半是人工，但那削壁數十丈，到也很有風趣，可惜臨湖建築的房屋，多憶毀損了。</p>
<p>田漢（左中）洪深（右中）與本報記者在杭垣留影（徐伯川攝）</p>
<p>從紹興又去百官，公路還是很好。</p>
<p>錢江鳥瞰（徐伯川攝）</p>
<p>到百官渡口</p>
<p>便是曹　江的曹　鎭所在。曹娥江原名舜江，即是堯舜之「舜」，　當時治水，把此江江流疏入杭州灣海中，因以之紀念，後因孝女曹　，投江救父，又改今名，渡江即為百官鎭，鎭上有大　　，屋宇多用石柱支撐，想見建築年代的久遠，惟廟內未加整理，淩亂慘敗，不是紀念先　所應該有的現象，百官鎭計長三華里許，也有許多店舖賣洋貨的，大多數店舖都是賣鹹海味之類，因爲這裏已近海邊了。工程師們正計劃恢復</p>
<p>百官至周巷</p>
<p>的公路，如果道公路一通，不必再借用杭　鐵路舊通，而且此路可通往觀海衛，由觀海衛可通往鄞縣，對商運上有很多便利，對國防上也有很多　値。他們精心的在計劃如何使此公路標準化，如何使公路不必遷就橋樑而减少彎道。</p>
<p>由百官渡江返歸紹興，我又關心到紹興今年的糧食，我問當地的老百姓，他們告訴我紹興木爲缺糧之縣，今年亁旱，靠河的田還好，不靠河的田就完了。紹興，沒有一家新式的旅館，旅店裹有蚊虫，又有臭虫，田先生和記者兩人一夜沒有好睡。</p>

<h3>麵粉組昨連開兩次會議　議價採機動方式　廠粉每包議定為十八萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨日發表談話稱：二月間本市麺粉價格發生彼動，社會局曾將本市物價評議委員會麺粉組議價予以恢復，原定每週舉行評價一次，惟本市非產麥區，所有製粉工業需用原料，均係仰給外埠，故對於粉價之評定，悉以產地應聚處之麥價爲根據。乃日來產地藝價波動甚烈，如仍以定期性之評議，配合上落靡定之麥價，則粉麥兩項價格易致脫節。如產地麥價高而木市粉價低，廠商即無法　進原料。爰定自木週起，對於粉價評議採取機動方式，隨時作合理之調整，以期原料與成品價格不致脫節。</p>
<p>物價評議會麵粉組昨日上午及下午，在社會局分別舉行第三及第四次評議會。均由糧食科長吉明齋任主席。上午第三次會，評議事項：　第四區麺粉工業同業工會提為麥價上漲，議價不敷成本，在木市小麥來源未暢及內地麥價未平之前，擬請暫停麺粉議價案，決議爲適應時宜，此後採機動性議價，由本會隨時按照成木並酌加利潤作合理之評定。　評定粉價案，決議廠粉每包十八萬元，零售價格不得超過十八萬七千元。</p>
<p>下午四時續開第四次粉價評議會，主席報吿：　上午第三次評議會評議價格業已公吿實施，而市塲價格且低於限價。故情形良好，此次召開第四次評議會藉以決定明日（即今日十月一日）之市價。　零售商進銷麵粉應作日報表，藉防流弊。評議事項：　今日（十月一日）粉價廠粉每包十八萬元，零售不得過十八萬七千元。　如麥價發生變動時，隨時召集會議評定粉價。</p>
<h3>多空爭逐激烈　永紗形勢飄忽</h3>
<p>華股昨頗多掙扎，永紗在多空火併下，形勢不定。晨收時與後市收盤前，雙方爭執甚烈。終以銀根奇緊，易遭質風所迫低，惟小型股頗有生氣。結果較前收計永紗信和美亞華豐中法內衣景綸統益榮　中與恒　微降，新華漲停，新光景福漲停後有　，較增資前各漲一成，勤興火柴尙平，閘北中絲跌半成，中紡跌一成弱，商務小升。遞交股計永紗華豐信和美亞微降，後市證金傳說又多，　氣稱蘇。永紗漲到即交二七五元遞交二七七元。終以國行交換差進甚多，大戶紛紛賣出，又被迫低至即交二六六元，遞交二七○元。是時紗廠櫃　前，多空爭執甚烈。經三六號一一六號維特，收市以二七○元及二七一元之價結束。收後喊價平平，結果較　收計即交股永紗美亞新光景福中紡勤興微升，閘北統益火柴景綸微挫，華豐信和恒豊平平，新華漲停。遞交股計永紗信和美亞微降，華　平。塲外各老股形勢尙形平定。</p>
<p>證交暫行營業細則第七七條轉讓預約辦法，施行期限屆滿，部令准予展延至本年十二月底止，明年元旦起，各上市之公司廠商，即應以正式股票上市，不得再行稽延。</p>
<p>第四十八期遞延交易交割日，適逢國慶例假，應提前於十月九日辦理，是期遞交做至十一月七日前市止，下期遞交提前於十月八日前市開始，仍於下週五辦理交割。</p>
<p>遞延交易試辦期滿，財經兩部令，在未奉行政院指令以前，暫准繼續開拍。</p>
<h3>統債外股均疲</h3>
<p>公債昨疲態　露，五〇三室五五五室五三八室買進，三六〇室五五二室二三〇室則出，統丙晨開一三三〇〇元，低價一一一七〇〇元，高價一三七〇〇元，而後轉盤。結果較前收計甲乙跌六〇〇元，統丙降低九〇〇元，統丁低八〇〇元，統戊微挫二〇〇元，成交約五百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨平　而恍惚，各股形勢呆滯。銀行帮買進，證券帮則出。港申電續縮，尙見穩定。怡紗長開一二九五〇〇元，高價不過一三三五〇〇一元，而後轉平。結果較前收計紙業怡啤航業尙平，鋼業怡紗小升，英聯會德豊業廣小挫。</p>
<h3>行莊存款增加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行稽核處發表，木年八月份上海商業行莊存款及準備金總額，計存款總額爲一四一，三九四，二七七，三六三，〇九三元，較七月份增加三八，二〇三，五九一，九四九，八六六元。已繳存款準備金二〇，九五九，三一四，三〇六，五三九元，較七月份增加五，五九一，一五六，三五八，二六七元。存款總額中，活期存款佔一三二，四九五，八五二，〇八七，四三九元，定期存款佔八，八五三，四二五，二七五，六五四元，均較七月份有顯著之增加。</p>
<h3>食糧湧到　粳米回跌</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧二萬三千九百餘石，銀根緊迫，散戶吐售，到貨湧塞，粳米回跌萬餘元，秈米早疲午定，略帶軟化，白元平平。</p>
<p>麵粉配價調整，市場交易不多，微升二三千元。統粉洋粉均升三四千元，審議價格，評定配價，不得超越十八萬元。麩皮存貨不多，執貨者甚堅，漲無止境，再騰三五千元。豆餅汕頭見懈，回挫千元。黃豆廠方納胃平淡，本街揀高拾取，市况高定次呆。荼豆南洋去化淸淡，平疲之格。蠶豆另化尙可，挺升三五千元，客帮依然不動。元麥步砌三五千元，紅糧客心堅挺，盤升二三千元。苞米北洋依然選高納取，見挺三五千元，中次仍懈。生仁華南暢納，飛奔二三萬元。芝蔴廣帮猛吸之下，奔騰三萬餘元。</p>
<p>油市猛漲不已，生油供不應求，續見飛奔三四五萬元不一。豆油亦然，再高一二萬元。淸油菜油跟漲一二萬元，蔴油亦升二三萬元。上海食油公司計劃存油配售，零售商正在辦理之中。</p>
<h3>銀根緊勢依舊　國家行局繼續差入</h3>
<p>〔木報訊〕國家行局昨在票據交換所繼續差入六九七億元，銀根緊勢依舊，惟暗息略降，二角二分。差出入細數中，中央獨家差入一三二七億元，直接交換行莊差入一三六億元，洋商差入八五億元，代理交換行莊差出一二四億元。其他各行局全部差出，中國出一二四億元，交通出四○七億元，中農出三四二億元，中信出二二四億元，郵匯出三三二億元，合作金庫出入○二億元。</p>
<h3>存貨已消耗殆盡　毛紡業搶救原原原料</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市毛紡織工業同業公會，爲原料短絀，生產不繼，昨特召開理事會，並招待記者。席間該會常務理事葛傑臣，葉弗康等，相繼致詞，略以政府每次羊毛配額，僅敷該業所需要百分之十五。而各廠所存原料，刻已消耗殆盡。故亟望政府對：　已到埠且已付款之羊毛，　已訂合同且已付款之羊毛，准予發給許可證。同時寬放以後羊毛輸入限額，免該業陷於停工之危局。該會刻已成立搶救原料委員會，決定推派代表，於日內晋京，分向有關院部會呼　解救原料，恐慌問題云。</p>
<h3>紡建公司停配棉布　布商請求恢復配售　經布商解釋紡建允予復査</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國紡建公司吳副總經理語記者，紡建此次停止布商二百餘家配布權，於布商同業，實屬有利。設對已停止配布權之布號，不分靑紅皂白，堅持一體恢復配布權，實有背政府維持正當合法商人之主旨。且停配布商中，果自認爲有正當理由，不應停配者，儘可另再申請，由紡建儘運復査。如布商對維持正當商人之主旨，仍堅持反對，則紡建勢將以配布權，分配予全國各埠之布商云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡織建設公司於上星期六，宣布停止棉布商號二零五家配售棉布，羣情憤激，集議反對呼繃。昨日適逢紡建開貨之期，一致停止開貨。原有之標貨，亦連帶停止。上午九時許，棉布公會恐事態擴大，召開理監事緊急會議，商討辦法。議決向紡建解釋，並推派常務理事高藹周，理事江兆祖王實祥等，陪同停配同業代表吳振珊，　芝慶等五人，前往該公司要求迅予恢復配售，以免糾紛。當由紡建吳副經理味經接見，吳氏對於調査，容有失實之處，表示歉意，聲明可申叙事實，迅即復査，以資補救。並希望公會能多與協助，代表等回至公會，又列席同業之會議，多數同業仍表不滿，各代表尙擬分訪同業諸領袖，再作呼籲云。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司於昨日下午四時，發表通吿一則如下：「木公司二十八日公吿停止配售紗布之各商號，如自認爲有正當理由，不應停配者，可詳叙一切，並檢同證件，即函送本公司，當儘速復査。倘合於規定者，即予恢復，特此公吿」。</p>
<h3>棉紗布下挫</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開因銀根仍緊，本客兩帮納意甚懈，市上吐多吸少，市勢虛軟。旋有客帮見價低吸收，價稍回挺，結果四二支籃鳳紗比週六低一百五十萬元，二十支雙馬軋降九十萬，十六支光明軋小一百十萬元，其餘各支粗細紗，則都下挫三四五十萬至百餘萬元。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開一度喊高，旋以銀根仍緊迫，吐售甚多，客帮亦轉賣，市面遂吿下挫。最後能頭細布比週六下瀉一萬六千元，五福彩球藍　等各細布，亦回降二三四萬元，其他漂布粗布嘩嘰等，亦一致下挫。</p>
<p>又訊：紡建公司照例關售陽　細布，價五十二萬元，跳鯉元光斜五十萬元。</p>
<h3>棉市續疲</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况，因銀根仍緊，買戶稀少，價格再見下挫，人心軟弱，交易淸淡，成交五百包左右。送廠價，靈實做開三三五萬，大中集三三〇包，成交一七五包，棧交價靈寳三二三萬至三三〇萬，成交三一五包，周浦籽花五一萬。</p>
<h3>行莊繳有準備金　美金庫券不適用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財部前准各行莊，以短期庫券存國行，抵充存款準備金百分之五十。茲以庫券改按市價折算後，價値時有變動未能適用於固定之準備金額，故自昨日起，該項庫券抵充準備金之辦法，已吿取銷，對已繳存部份，即日退還云。</p>
<h3>煤價再予調整</h3>
<p>關於煤斤價格再度調整一節，卅日下午，據經濟部燃料管理委員會負責人稱：基於近來遝輸人力費用不斷上漲，及外匯價格之變動，致煤價不得不作合理之調整。對於上項問題，業經呈請經濟部核示，預料十月一日即可正式發表。</p>
<h3>食鹽停止輸日</h3>
<p>（本報訊〕我國對日易貨，向以食鹽爲大宗。自鹽政局爲减少鹽稅而呈准停止以食鹽作易貨物資後，中信局之易貨業務，已大受影響。目前可用以易貨者，僅餘食糖及礦砂兩項。惟悉我國工業所需要之人造絲原料，仍可向麥帥總部以記賑方式取得，故供應不致斷絕。</p>
<h3>脫貨求現者多　人造絲價疲落　廠經喊價亦頻頻下降</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市上午慘跌，因同業中銀根奇緊，紛紛脫貨求現，以致一二○號雜牌有光，開盤時初喊六百五六十萬元，後竟降至四百六七十萬始有成交。迄中午續挫至三百二三十萬元收盤，下午銀根軋齊後，持貨者即不頤廉售，五百萬元有做開。最後行情，又升至六百萬元賣出，結果較上日短去一百五十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>昨市　聲充斥，喊價頻頻下降，但仍乏交易做開。下午稍定，喊價比上午大起五十萬元，C字喊六百萬元，D字五百萬元，均比上日短五十萬元之譜。另担成交價在三百萬至四百萬元之間。千經更滯，戒價跌勢較厲。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市堅穏，同業中銀根雖緊迫，但因各廠埃在怠工或罷工中，生產日减，故人心較好。大誠與華强眞絲被面開市在六百八十萬元左右，節節上升，最大做過七百三十萬元，後因原料告跌，漸見下退，收市時七百○二萬元即期價，隔日期喊廿四五萬元。格子　縐喊價仍站六萬一千元之左，華錦縐因人絲慘降，故昨市高檔貨三萬八千元有成交，各貨均稍露軟意。</p>

<h3>紀酒泉飛機失蹤罹難之藝術家韓樂然</h3>
<p>— 敬齊</p>
<p>三十五年夏六月，余隨于院長巡視新疆，識韓樂然先生於迪化。右公特器識樂然，許其對於吾國藝術將有大貢獻也。時樂然方自南疆拜城一帶返迪北，發現唐代佛畫及古蹟特多；邀其再往南疆，欣然許諾。在南疆越半月，歷十餘縣區，時聆其津津道年來尋覓佛洞，發掘古蹟之經過。至其忍受凍餒，盡歷艱險；有時迷涂於戈壁中，餐雪飲風，駝騎四出探路途，終得出險。如聽探險故事，爲之神往者再。在旅次中嘗爲同人寫照，有時數筆即成，神態百出。尤以過天山機中所繪同人合影，最爲逼眞。返迪化後，樂然展　其在南疆作品百餘幀。其所臨摹佛洞壁畫數十幅，悉爲唐人所繪；明證中西藝術交流之始。初油畫與水彩畫則寫各族人物與風尙，維妙維肖，多嘆觀止。此種展覽在迪化尙　創舉，地方人士往觀者數千人，洵盛事也。右公且委之爲新疆區監察使署專門委員，資鼓勵也。去冬自蘭州遺書，謂擬於今春再至南疆，繼續未竟之功，作有系統之硏究。前月中得六月廿二日拜城克孜爾千佛洞來　，詳敍此次工作收穫概况，及今後志趣。詎報載於卅一日搭機自哈密至酒泉中途失踪，至今未獲。以之告知右公，俱爲痛悼不已。蘭州昨來電，樂然携南疆畫稿與俱云。</p>
<p>樂然籍東北，留學法國習繪事。抗戰軍興歸國，參加政治工作，奔馳冀晋陝等省有年；勝利後始婚聚。繼張大千赴敦煌硏究佛畫，又數赴南疆，吐魯番，庫車，拜城等處，研摹佛洞唐畫；並發掘西夏丹書墓誌多方。以其有藝術天才，深遠學藝，研究志趣，堅強毅力，而又能耐勞苦，不畏艱險，以爲必有助於西北文化之發塲；不意所志未竟，罹此浩刧！西北文化之不幸，亦吾國藝術界之一大損失也。今以其來書供諸有心人古代藝術者之參考，用餐數言於聞首。</p>
<p>附刊</p>
<h3>韓樂然先生遺書</h3>
<p>（上略）去歲從新疆返蘭後，即作準備工作，到本年一月，始有頭緒。因車子諸問題，於二月廿二日由蘭來新，擁助手二人，學生五人，及一切所用器材，三月十二號抵迪化。本擬在吐魯蕃作長期工作，適逢當地時局紊亂，祗好改作西行。</p>
<p>四月二號由迪化動身，十九號安抵拜城境的克孜爾千佛洞，沿途發現很多古城遺蹟。因爲有預定工作，不能即刻挖掘。經庫車逗留六天，十六號往古木吐拉考察。道是二次重來了。此地離坐車五十萬里，兩面都是高高的山，佛洞馨在右邊的山崖上；因爲該山是砂礫的冲積而成，風化也是長易，所以當日的聖境，都一蹋糊塗了。洞前的渭干河水，在嗚鳴地悲嗚，像是弔古傷感，此時的弟也有些唏噓。</p>
<p>這兒佛洞，還看見壁畫的寥寥無幾，最多不過二十座；比較究整的更是少見，所餘都是破爛不堪了。壁畫損失大半是人爲的。一部爲老百姓和遊人破壊的，一部是外國考古隊剝走的；並且將所有漢字作有計劃破壊，想毀滅我國文化，强調都長他們的文明。但是他們做的不够澈底，好多佛的名稱和古時的解說，都還能模糊的看見漢字。據弟各方考察，確爲我國唐代作品。我們文終化歸我們的，他們怎能毀滅的了呢？</p>
<p>克孜爾千佛洞，是弟現在工作的地方，也是去年工作過的。在我國除去敦煌佛洞，是沒有能同它相比的。不唯洞廟多，而作品年代也較久，最低在一千三百年與兩千年左右。據整理編號的結果，總計有畫的七十五座，比較古木吐拉却完整多了。但是被外國攷古隊剝走的更厲害，有的完全被拿光。在所剩的殘缺畫面上，仍可看出當時的繪寶精神，不但構圖精密，施色絢爛，就是人體解剖，光暗對比，也都很注意。幷且他們的宗敎思想，和哲學基礎，也都表現出來。可證明那時畫畫的人，不是普通的畫匠，而是有思想有訓練的專家們。有一座沒畫佛畫的洞裏，搶有人體解剖圖，更可證明有類似美術學校的設備。</p>
<p>上月二號於第一號洞前，發現唐代開元錢一枚，可知那時漢人在這裏交往很密了</p>
<p>因所用器材將完，擬於六月十九日返回蘭州。弟來一次工作檢討，共臨大小油畫三十餘幅，差不多各時期的代表都臨了。其他助手學生們臨有圖案畫三十餘種，及攝影記者等工作。最後兩星期以有限經濟，作挖掘工作。因爲有很多洞，都未曾挖掘過的。找了十三個工人，挖了十天，才淸理好一個洞。這次試挖，收獲很大，壁畫新奇，爲他洞所沒有，除一少部分被地震所損，餘皆完整。幷且畫上有許多古代文字，像是畫題人名之類。這是弟所渴望的，也是有價値的。此外古代飾物褪色的木板畫，和部份的雕像，也得到不少。爲了要把新洞壁畫臨完，祗好延長一星期。弟恐怕新洞再被人破壊，特找木匠，做了一個門鎖上，交給一個老百姓管理。拜城縣政府也有通令，想以後一定好的多了。</p>
<p>回去後把這次工作加以整理，即充實準備下期工作。可能今冬入新，擬從庫車以西，錢往喀什和聞婼羗一帶。（下略）</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>耀羣把暗記地位相度好了，立即穿過街來，只作閒看街景似的，把背貼牆一站，很敏捷熟讀地，周圍打量了一眼，回手背後，早用鉛筆，把暗記劃在相中的地位上了。</p>
<p>暗記做好之後，耀羣順便在這飯店左右，來回躊躇了一下，爲的是要檢査這暗記做得是否完整合式。就在這一蹓躇回到旅舍門口的時候，忽然發現南頭二三十碼外，迎面來了五六個年齡不等的少壯，二十歲左右到三十左右的都有。這幾個少壯，雖說前前後後，各不相聯，散開走着：但從步伐統一速率上看去，在許多行人中，凸現出了一個小團體的聯繫。用這同一的觀察點看去，見對街那邊，也有三四個少壯，路着一致的步伐。</p>
<p>在耀羣的眼光下，這一羣少壯的標識，比較一隊穿着制服的軍隊，混跡在普通人群中的標識，還要明顯。她猜想這一個少壯團體中，說不定就有一位是駐津支隊的同志；於是一回身跨上了旅舍大門口的兩磬石階，面外站　；還樣，她把本身的地位，目標，也表觀得非常　出；別說有心的同志，不會漏掉這個目標，連不相干的路人，也被她的顯著地位所吸引，百忙中也要對她投一個好奇或審美或無聊的眼、、</p>
<p>經羣測　來人的距離，到了相常的地步，趕緊送出了暗號——一種極普通的動作；外人，任是如何神經過敏，也絕對不致猜疑的動作，却是同志探詢同志的暗號。她閃鑠着一雙亮晶晶地眼珠，像掣電一般，對這羣散漫的少壯行列掃射着。她希望收到反應。</p>
<p>果然，這少壯行列頭邊走着的一人，約莫三十歲左右，穿着普通西服，中等身個，白皮膚，瘦長臉蛋，最特別的標識是　一雙吊梢長眉，即普通書中說的「雙眉入鬢」，像舞台上的化裝眉毛，表現一個强烈的抗拒個性；他一眼瞧見耀羣，當然也看出她的暗號，先是眼光突地一亮，表示驚異，立即隨意舉起右手來，在自己頭髮上拂抹了一下，答覆了罐羣的暗號；同時、雙眉忽地　了起來。</p>
<p>「怪！...車也這麼難」。耀羣趁這領隊還離開五六步的當口，這麽悄聲自言自語。這是探索同志的第二步「隱語」。（這一類隱語，並無規定字句，只是見眼生情的平常話，如有同伴對語時，則以重複一句爲符號）。</p>
<p>照規定辦法，來人如屬同志，聽了這隱語，當時即須用「射覆」或「猜謎」式的語句答覆，所答僅須與對方發出語意，略有關通即成。但這位同志似乎看出某種警兆，並未開口，僅拿眼睛在「中國飯店」的市招上，略一注視，代替答語，（耀羣的「雇車」是表示此處到某處的行動性，或表示預備要到目的地去，來人目視飯店市招，表示「地址」與「　車」針對，或答覆耀羣不必上目的地去，似乎說，他已經知道「地點」，可以到「中國飯店」來）·答覆之後他同時又用姆指與中指一彈，「匹」地一響，發出一個「特別危險」警貨</p>
<p>以機智見長·這時旣然收到隱語的答覆，同時又收到特殊危險的警號，就應該迅速注意環境，暫時中止探尋同志的其他步綫，小心檢點自己的動作，留意觀察危險在什麽地方，以備趨避。但這時耀羣不知爲了什麽，好像失去理智似的，也許過於大　，並不重視對方的警吿，只微微一笑，便舉步跨下台階，預備追隨那位領　，再作探詢。</p>

<h3>悼亡之痛</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>紫羅蘭盒雜碎</p>
<p>悼亡之痛，非過來人不能知，奉倩神傷，無怪其然；尤其是中年與老年悼亡，最難爲懐，因爲多年老伴，厮守已慣，一且死別，這打擊實在太大了。丙戌春四月二十三日，我婦鳳君以肺病倂發心臟病去世，三十年相依爲命，突然間永隔人天，就是我國古詩人所謂「腸斷」，西方人所謂「心碎」，也比喻不上我那時的苦痛；後來曾寫了一封「寄亡婦鳳君書」，又塡了「羅敷媚」「醉花陰」等小詞三十餘關，總算發洩了一下。可是一年以來，餘哀未盡，觸緒紛來，木想再寫一封萬言書，寄亡婦於地下，向她訴說這一年來的種種，偶然和朋友們提起，他們說：算了吧，死者已矣，何必作此無益之事，多惹一番傷感呢？我一想不錯，因此騰欲動筆，而終於擱了下來；但是平日每讀昔人詩詞，總留心着他們的悼亡之作，挑選那些情文兼至的，一一摘錄下來，也是借他人酒杯，澆自己塊壘之意。就中如厲樊榭元夕悼亡姬調寄淸平樂云：「春衫淚淙，誰問春寒淺？依舊去年正月半，錦瑟華年未滿。重來徑曲苔荒。一屏梅影凄凉。疑在小樓前後，不知何處迷藏？一末二語想入非非，愈見沉痛。納蘭容若霄衫濕悼亡云：「近來無限傷心事，誰與話長更，從敎分付，綠窗紅淚，早雁初蔦　當時領略，而今斷送，總負多情。忽疑君到，漆燈風點，痴數春星。」南鄉子爲亡婦題照云：「淚咽却無聲。祗向從前悔薄情。憑向向向丹靑重省識，盈盈。一片傷心畫不成。別語态分明。午夜鶼鶼夢早醒。卿自早醒儂自夢，更更。泣盡風檐夜雨鈴。」金縷曲亡婦忌日有感云：「此恨何時已！滴空階寒更雨歇，葬花天氣。三載悠悠魂夢杳，是夢久應醒矣。料也覺人間無味。不及夜台塵土隔，冷淸淸一片埋愁地，釵鈿約，竟拋棄。重泉若有雙魚寄，好知他年來苦樂，與誰相倚？我自終宵成轉側，忍聽湘絃重理。待結個他生知已。還怕兩人俱總命。再緣慳賸月零風裏。淸淚盡，紙灰起。」此外還有幾　，俱見通志堂詞中，也足見他當時的痛切心腑了。洪北江因夫人蔣氏之崁，也在詩詞中一唱三歎，十分眞摯，詩如悼亡七律八首，有「偶思卿語閒中涕，頻把生魂暗裏招，何堪枕冷衾寒夜，重聽兒啼女哭聲，」「隻影更誰憐後死，遺言先已訂他生」等句，都很悲切動人。詞如浪淘沙云：「夢入小紅扉。露　簾衣。錢匳殘月影微微。偏是獨眠人帳外，胡蝶雙飛。小膽更多疑。怕踏層梯。畫屛灤處認依稀。七尺紫檀香案上，誰共扶乩？「斜照鬼門關。落月彎環。夜台可有望夫山？生怕瘦魂扶不上，添箇紅闡。推枕漏初殘。朱淚斑斑。寒宵何止夢能還？地下若無埋恨處，仍到人間。」又云：路遠小樓低。花朶分飛。依然銜恨上重梯。何止舊人尋不見，梁燕都非。愁裏闢會扉。殘月剛剛剛西。畫簾風破鏡台欹。只有曲屛風六扇，猶罩羅衣。」八聲甘州夢亡婦云：「向空房盡處瓦燈昏，缺月影橫陳。算傷離感逝，殘冬旣爾，何况經春？打疊半牀衾枕，時爲拂纖慶。匬鏡都安好，與照歸魂。畢竟瞞卿何事？只夜台相値，間尙殷勤。歎襄王孤館，久已斷行雲。想闌干東西十二，便夢回總欲一周巡。梅花句，從今不賦，防要含顰。」其浪淘沙詞中「夜台可有望夫山」句，與拙作悼念亡婦詩中「九泉應有望夫山一句約略相似，可見悼亡者的癡想，也會不謀而合的。</p>

<h3>Relevant Authorities Discuss Detailed Measures, Executive Yuan to Expand Powers, Draft of National Assets Declaration and Registration Overseas Passed, Awaiting Completion of Legislative Procedures Before Promulgation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Reliable sources confirm: The Executive Yuan will expand its powers, possessing a more decisive significance than at present.</p>
<p>The methods for expansion are being carefully discussed by relevant authorities. It is said that the reason is that although the current Executive Yuan appears in the guise of a "responsible cabinet," many actual government affairs decisions still require the final decision of the State Council. The State Council functions as both a policy-making body and an actual government affairs decision-making body, while the Executive Yuan becomes merely a transitional organization responsible for relaying information, which violates the true meaning of a responsible cabinet. Therefore, the expansion of its powers is inevitable.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Draft Regulations on the Declaration and Registration of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China has been passed by the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on [blank] day, and by the [blank] National Government Committee. It will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures before being promulgated and implemented. It is understood that the draft regulations include the following main points: Registration period: All Chinese citizens, except those who resided abroad before July 7, 1937, or those who legally operated businesses abroad before the same date, shall declare and register their foreign exchange assets deposited abroad on the date the regulations are promulgated and implemented, within 30 days of the promulgation and implementation of the regulations, according to the prescribed forms, to the National Bank. Foreign exchange obtained after the promulgation of these regulations shall be registered within 30 days from the date of acquisition. Registration authorities: Consulates in the locations of overseas Chinese residents. Applicable objects: Including natural persons and legal entities. Foreign exchange assets to be declared: Including cash, current and fixed foreign currency deposits, foreign gold coins, raw gold, and any payment rights obtained from foreign countries (such as foreign currency securities, stocks, bonds, land deeds, insurance policies, annuities, etc. issued by the Chinese or foreign governments). Furthermore, for foreign exchange assets that are jointly owned or co-managed with foreigners, the portion owned or managed by Chinese citizens shall be declared and registered. For foreign exchange assets applied for registration, the income or changes obtained from deposits and foreign currency assets may be retained according to the following provisions, except for a certain amount: The remaining amount shall be transferred to the National Bank account under the original contract holder's name. 1. Daily living expenses for the individual or their family residing abroad. 2. Medical expenses for the individual or their family for treatment of illnesses abroad. 3. Daily living expenses for children residing abroad during their study period. 4. Travel expenses for the individual or their family traveling abroad and returning home. 5. Funds necessary for operating legal agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining businesses. The above items are limited to those who have already gone abroad before the promulgation of these measures. The retained amount will be determined separately by the Ministry of Finance. Deposits transferred to the National Bank account, in addition to being exchanged for legal tender at the individual's discretion, may, with the approval documents based on import permits for purchasing permissible imported materials or for other legitimate uses, be used to draw from the original currency deposits. If there are any production tools among the encouraged imported materials, the government should provide facilities for establishing factories and transportation. After the promulgation of these regulations, except for those handled in accordance with the methods stipulated in the preceding two articles, Chinese citizens shall not transfer foreign exchange assets in any way to any natural persons or legal entities at home or abroad. Any Chinese citizen who fails to declare and register their foreign exchange assets in accordance with the regulations, or who makes false declarations, shall be severely punished and their foreign exchange assets confiscated. These regulations shall be implemented immediately upon promulgation.</p>

The report will also be submitted to the State Council for reference. Furthermore, the information obtained by Zhang during this trip to the Northeast mostly consists of requests and instructions submitted by local military and political authorities regarding urgent issues such as military and political affairs, refugee relief, school funding, grain administration, and military rations.

<h3>Plan to Establish Police in the National Border, The Ministry of Interior Has Drafted it and Submitted it to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Ministry of Interior believes that since our country has never established national border police, and at a time when the international situation is tense and there are many troubles on the border, it is necessary to establish them. The ministry has conducted a long-term study, drafted a plan, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The principle is: the national border police is the national police, which will be handled by the General Police Department of the Ministry of Interior. It will be divided into sections according to the natural conditions of the national border, and the National Border Police Bureau will be established. In areas where the border situation is special, national border police preparatory offices may be established in neighboring areas. Expenses will be paid by the national treasury, and equipment will be supplied by the central government. The first batch of police officers will be trained with 200 people. A. Land border: Establish at Jiangkou, Establish at Harbin (or Bei'an), and govern the old Qigan from the Tumen River estuary to the border between Heilongjiang and Xing'an provinces. Establish at Hailar, and govern Qigan to Dong'ermiao. Establish at Cangjiang, and govern Dong'ermiao to Yingen. Establish at Juyan, and govern Yingen to Chahantonggu. Establish at Wuzhen, and govern Chahantonggu to Osten Tagh. Establish at Shule, and govern Osten Tagh to the border between Xinjiang and Tibet. Establish at Jiang [blank], and govern the border between Xinjiang and Tibet to Mongolia. Establish at [blank]chong, and govern Mongolia to Cheli. Establish at Mengzi, and govern Cheli to Ba'ai. Establish at Longzhou, and govern Mian'ai to Beihekou. B. Sea border: Establish at Guangzhou, and govern the coastline of the southeast, west, and central archipelagoes of Hainan Island.

Establish at Tianjin, and govern the coastlines of Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Foreign Exchange Usage, Report of the Supervisory Committee About to be Completed, Over 10,000 Words and to be Submitted to the President</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The four members of the Supervisory Committee who went to Shanghai to investigate the use of foreign exchange have returned to Nanjing and are carefully drafting the report. After several days of careful discussion, the full text was completed on [blank] day, with a length of 14,500 words, and is expected to be submitted to President Yu in the next day or two. It is said that the main [blank] will be submitted separately in the future. According to a member of the Supervisory Committee who participated in the investigation, "We have drafted this report entirely objectively, and every word and sentence is carefully considered, and there is absolutely no prejudice involved." When asked by the reporter what the difference between this investigation and the first investigation was, he replied: "This investigation is much more extensive than before."</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] Well-informed sources claimed today that the report on the investigation of foreign exchange transactions by the four members of the Supervisory Committee is as long as 10,000 words, stating that the government, due to its reliance on US loans, failed to utilize the assets obtained from the victory over Japan. At the time, there were an estimated 58 million taels of gold, with a total value of hundreds of millions of US dollars. Some officials believed that economic aid from the United States could be obtained, resulting in the waste of foreign exchange, and blamed the government for mistakenly believing that the civil unrest would not be prolonged.</p>
<h3>Opening Up Political Power in Guangdong, Hubei, and Anhui, The Government has Notified the Min and Youth Parties that they Can Nominate Three Provincial Committee Members to Participate Separately</h3>
<p>[News from this newspaper] Reliable sources say that the government has agreed to [partially] open up local political power in Guangdong, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. The Min and Youth parties can each nominate three provincial committee members to participate in the administrative organizations of the three provinces. Both parties have received notification from the government. The Youth Party's response to this will be decided by the Central Standing Committee within a few days. The Min She Party's position is that [they will] participate in local public opinion institutions, but are temporarily unwilling to assume actual responsibilities. Therefore, they are taking a non-contending attitude on the point of opening up local political power. If the government invites them to serve on the provincial committee, they are willing to consider it, but they are unwilling to concurrently serve as the head of any department. Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's opposition to the parties' request to appoint councilors, a spokesman for the Min She Party said: Shanghai councilors are indeed elected, but councilors in other provinces and cities are appointed. In fact, they are designated by the government as a temporary public opinion institution, and the [nomination] requests of the parties are aimed at this. The party does not intend to give a formal response to the statement of the speaker and deputy speaker of the municipal council.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Opinions on the Peace Treaty with Japan, Ye Gongchao Invites Representatives from All Parties in Shanghai to a Discussion and Makes a Record to Send to the Peace Treaty Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Since its establishment, the Secret Committee on the Peace Treaty with Japan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has held several meetings to listen to the opinions of the participants on issues related to the peace treaty with Japan. In order to solicit more opinions, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao specially came to Shanghai with Huang Zhengming, Director of the East Asian Department, yesterday. In the afternoon, at 4 pm, he invited more than 20 representatives from all relevant parties in the city, including the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the press, representatives from industry and commerce, and social celebrities, to hold a symposium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China to listen to their opinions, so that a record can be made and sent to the Peace Treaty Review Committee for reference. It is understood that the purpose of this meeting, in addition to listening to the opinions provided by all sectors, is also to make all parties understand the government's attitude and position on the peace treaty with Japan. Ye told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that our country has always maintained a consistent attitude on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. All claims are based on safeguarding our country's position. Because our country's position is not entirely the same as that of other countries, our claims and capabilities have our own reasons. In his recent speeches, Foreign Minister Wang has clearly explained this point.</p>
<p>According to relevant sources, the Chinese side absolutely insists on retaining the right of veto, and China's attitude is determined by China's own needs. Some foreign opinions misunderstand that our country is influenced by the Soviet Union, but the attitude held by our country has sufficient reasons.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon's symposium was chaired by Ye Gongchao. The meeting lasted for two hours and ended at six o'clock. The list of participants and the content of the discussion will not be announced for the time being.</p>
<h3>Problem of Packaging the First Batch of Japanese Reparation Machines Unresolved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th, United Press] Among the machine tools and precision tools in the first batch of emergency reparations from Japan to China and other countries, 51% are first-class tools that can be used with only minor repairs. According to the current reparations plan, China can obtain 50% of the total amount of this batch of materials, while the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Nations of the British Empire can evenly divide the remaining 50%. This batch of machines, from small precision tools to hydraulic presses, has a total of 19,500 machines, of which 43% belong to the second class, including drilling machines, chiseling machines, drilling machines, lathes, textile machines, and other secondary tools for processing metals. Among them are bending machines, hydraulic presses, mechanical presses, and trimming [blank] machines. This batch of machines varies in age, but more than half are classified as "usable after minor repairs." The question of which country should bear the cost of collection and packaging has not yet been decided, but some experts believe that the cost of packaging will seriously hit Japan's reconstruction plans.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Sources in diplomatic circles: Regarding the opening of private trade with [blank], the Far Eastern Commission approved a quota of 400 private individuals and merchant representatives from various countries to go to Japan in July.

Recently, according to a notification from the US State Department, the allocation method for the remaining quota has been re-[revised]. Among them, six places were reserved for the member state, the Soviet Union. The remaining 39 places have been allocated to non-Far Eastern Commission countries. The numbers are as follows: Belgium and Luxembourg 3 places, Sweden 3 places, Egypt 3 places, Switzerland 2 places, Norway 2 places, Argentina 2 places, [blank]roa 2 places, South African Federation 2 places.

<h3>Six Japanese Ships Compensating Our Country Arrive at Qingdao Port</h3>

<h3>US Army Department Proposes Plan to Help Us Train Ten New Divisions, Awaiting Approval from Washington Before Implementation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] Authoritative sources claim that in response to Chairman Chiang's request for whether the US military can assist in training the National Army, the US Army Department has proposed a plan to train, equip, and supply ten divisions of the National Army. General Sun Liren has established a training school in Taiwan. Once Washington approves the plan, it can be implemented.</p>
<p>It is said that the US Army Department will tell Chairman Chiang that ten divisions of American-trained troops can enable the National Army to contain the Communist Army and control all important areas. It is estimated that this plan will take one year to complete. Although ten divisions of troops are not enough to "eliminate" the Communist Army, 100,000 personnel will definitely be able to prevent serious interference by the Communist Army with China's economic and political recovery. It is understood that this plan will be released in Washington at the same time as the Wedemeyer report.</p>
<p>According to this plan, each division will receive three months of training, as each division already has some combat experience. Afterwards, the strength of each division will be increased to 15,000 people, and they will be transferred to the rear for another three months of rigorous training, during which American instructors will train them in the use of American weapons. Once the training is completed, they will be equipped with American weapons and transferred to the front lines for combat.</p>
<p>One of the main procedures in the proposed plan is to guide the air force in transporting and supplying these troops. US Army advisors have stated that what the Chinese government needs most in fighting the Communist Army is transport planes, not fighter planes. Therefore, China should be given light weapons rather than heavy weapons, as they believe that the weakness of the National Army in the Northeast is that the Communist Army has greater mobility. Therefore, the National Army does not need heavy artillery, giant tanks, or large trucks, as the terrain in China is rugged roads and rice paddies, so light transportation vehicles are needed.</p>
<p>The party did not specify how many US military advisors would be needed to implement this training plan, but it is believed that it will be greatly expanded, as there are currently only about 400 US military officers stationed in China, of which 20% are engaged in administrative work.</p>
<p>It is understood that US Army officials believe that training personnel should be widespread, with at least one in each battalion, to ensure the success of this plan.</p>

<h3>Grain Market Commotion in Wuxi, Grain Ministry Urgent Telegram for Investigation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 30th] The Ministry of Food learned that the Wuxi warehouse of the China Grain Company of Xi Grain had entrusted four grain firms, Chang Yutai, Taiheng, Xinmao, and Yixinhan, to purchase a large amount of grain at high prices in the city, causing a commotion in the market, and the market price soared and could not be suppressed. Therefore, it urgently telegraphed the magistrate of this city, Xu, today to investigate and report the facts for verification. Xu reported the facts after receiving the telegram. The rice price rose again today, and miscellaneous grains rose by 10,000.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Opinions on the Draft Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs intends to revise the Commercial Registration Law. The key points and outline of the draft have been published in this newspaper. The current law was promulgated and implemented on June 28, 1937, and its implementing regulations were promulgated and implemented on May 19, 1938. After ten years, many objective conditions have changed, and judging from its content, there are many inherent shortcomings, so it should be revised in a timely manner.</p>
<p>It is reported that this draft has been jointly reviewed by the Ministries of Social Affairs, Economy, Finance, and Justice, and it was unanimously considered "very important and agreed upon." We also believe that the latter law is indeed better than the former, with many advantages, especially the addition of a chapter on businesses operated by foreigners, which is very timely. However, considering the entire text, there are still many places that need to be discussed and revised. We will list them separately for reference.</p>
<p>The scope of commerce does not adopt a listing method. Article 3 of the current law lists sixteen types of businesses as commerce. Not only are there many omissions, but the classification is also too broad, so it is better to change to a definition-based provision, which is cleaner. However, Article 4 also has a supplement, "considered as commerce," so there is actually no difference. However, the revised draft is more concise in form.</p>
<p>Article 21 of the current law stipulates: "In the same county or city, the name of a business that has already been registered by another person shall not be used for the registration of the same business." No difference is seen in this draft. The purpose of commercial registration is to protect the rights of business names. This is the spirit of commercial registration, so there is no need to change it. The problem lies in the "same business" point, that is, what is considered the same business, and what is not considered the same business? This is closely related to whether it is listed or not. Taking Shanghai as an example, because commerce is particularly prosperous and the division of industries is particularly detailed, the sixteen types of commerce are actually no longer applicable. Many businesses' target customers often belong to two or even two or more industries, and at the same time belong to two or even two or more trade associations. For example, industrial raw materials are of course operated by the chemical raw materials industry, but pharmacies also concurrently operate this business. Some domestic pigments are also this type of goods, so a difficult problem arises. If it is said that it is the same business, then they argue forcefully, claiming that it belongs to two industries and two trade associations, and do not recognize it as the same business, so using a business name already registered by another person is not considered illegal. But if they are allowed to use it, then what they operate, at least in part, is industrial raw materials, which is actually the same business. This problem has not been solved by the current law, and the draft still has not solved it. We believe that the listing of commercial classifications is indeed necessary. However, if the central government uniformly stipulates it, the situations in various places are different, and it is inevitable that it will be like cutting the feet to fit the shoes, with many inconsistencies. It seems better to authorize the local competent officials to carefully consider and deliberate according to the actual situation in the local area and report to the Ministry for approval.</p>
<p>Registration of business names with the same name. In fact, many businesses use the same name as others, intentionally or unintentionally, such as "Lu Gao Jian," "Lao Da Fang," "Zhang Xiao Quan," and so on. There are countless examples. Article 34 of the implementing regulations stipulates: "A business name that has been used before another person's registration is not subject to the restrictions of Articles 21 and 22 of this law; however, there must be proof of prior establishment." This can be considered to have resolved some of the disputes. Also, because there are too many businesses with the same name in the same county or city, the previous method is not enough to cope with it. Therefore, the Ministry supplemented another method, that is, if many businesses with the same name mutually agree and provide written proof, they are all allowed to apply for registration, which may cause disputes. Because those who have already registered and those who are more qualified often refuse to provide written proof. Those who have joined the trade association as members are especially unwilling to provide proof for non-members who have not joined the association. This problem cannot be solved. The draft does not touch on this, which is obviously a major flaw.</p>
<p>The old custom had a method of adding a record, but it is not allowed by the current laws and regulations; in fact, accommodating the facts is not without being a compromise. For example, if the "Lu Gao Jian" mentioned above was originally established earlier, it should be allowed to add a record and be allowed to register separately, which seems more convenient than the method of mutual agreement and proof.</p>
<p>There is also a special fact, that is, old business names passed down from ancestors. If the business develops and the brothers use the same brand name under mutual agreement or the will of the ancestors, each operates their own business; in this situation, if they are allowed to add a record and register, it seems reasonable. However, under the current law, this path is blocked.</p>
<p>A business uses several business names. That is, a head office has several branches, although they use several names, but their capital is not divided. If these newly created businesses are allowed to register separately, there is no capital amount to fill in, and their conditions are not met; if they are not allowed to register, then these types of businesses have no way to obtain legal protection. The current law has no explicit provisions, so the competent officials reject them all. I wonder if the draft has any remedy for this?</p>
<p>Registration restrictions. Article 6 of the implementing regulations: "The business of being considered a business according to Article 4 of this law is limited to those that do not violate public order and good customs." According to this provision, as long as it does not violate public order and good customs, and the procedures are complete, it can be approved for registration without any other restrictions. However, in reality, there are indeed many that have to be restricted. For example, when a certain type of goods is implemented at a parity price, there are often many speculative businesses that spring up like clouds, and everyone seeks windfall profits. If they are all allowed to register, wouldn't it be encouraging speculation and disrupting the market? If registration is not allowed, what is the basis in law? Is the above article sufficient as a basis for refusing registration? What supplements does the draft have for this?</p>
<p>Mandatory registration. The current law originally adopted a free registration system, and there are no articles that can be used as a basis for mandatory registration. The current mandatory registration method is based on the Ministry's order in 1943, which is to change the law by order, and there are legal problems. The draft changes to mandatory registration, which can remedy the above defects and is a kind of progress in legislation. What can be discussed is whether this measure is necessary in fact? What is the meaning to the public and private? As mentioned above: Commercial registration was originally for the purpose of protecting its business name rights. Then, when businessmen themselves do not need this protection, they can freely decide and do not need to be forced. The draft explains: "Changing to a mandatory registration system enables the government to use the registration system to reasonably manage commerce and make it develop normally." This is the purpose. But we are very skeptical: Is it necessary for businesses to register before the government can manage them? Can they develop normally? If they don't register, can't they achieve the above purpose? To give an example, the government's current management methods are nothing more than price limits, price negotiations, cracking down on speculation and hoarding, etc. Then, we must ask: Can those who do not register not comply with these laws and regulations? When the government wants to implement these laws and regulations, is it necessary to first check the registered businesses according to the map? If, as mentioned above, speculative businesses obtain the registration qualification, they can apply for allocation. Then, is mandatory registration turning against them and allowing them to legally seek windfall profits? If, in order to prevent the above malpractices, restrictions can be added as appropriate, then under the current free registration system, there are not enough articles to cite, let alone after mandatory registration?</p>
<p>As repeatedly said above: The purpose of commercial registration is nothing more than to protect its business name rights. As for whether the business can be legally operated, there are many types that still need to be approved by the competent authority, such as obtaining a license, permit, etc. However, many businessmen, knowing little, often mistake registration for approval of operations, and regard the registration certificate as a license or permit. They believe that since the government has allowed registration, they can freely operate, which has caused many troubles. Those who understand the matter clearly also dislike applying separately, which is considered troublesome. Therefore, on the merits of the case, changing to the mandatory registration method is actually superfluous.</p>
<p>If the initial registration fee is set at one-thousandth of the capital amount, which is double the current rate in Shanghai, it will inevitably increase the burden on businessmen. Also, the supplementary provisions of the draft stipulate: Before the implementation of the new law, the registration made according to the current law, although having the same effect as the registration made according to the new law, if the original registered items do not conform to or are missing according to the new law, an application for change of registration should be made within one year. According to this, businessmen have to redo a set of procedures. We believe that these are all things that can be avoided and work that can be saved.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced this draft to solicit opinions from public and private legal persons before submitting it to the Executive Yuan for discussion. We hope that the above-mentioned points still have room for deliberation and remedy. Also, what the Ministry announced was originally only the key points of the draft, not the full text. We hope that the various shortcomings mentioned above are all stipulated in it.</p>

<h3>The United Nations Approves Pakistan's Efforts Officially Joins the United Nations The Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council are Re-elected The Membership Applications of the Five Axis Satellite States Have Not Yet Been Decided</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Lake Success, 30th Broadcast: Lake Success News, Due to the unanimous support of the United States and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia's election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council is almost a certainty. However, Czechoslovakia itself is unwilling to take on this important task, because it is not easy to deal with properly at a time when the conflict between East and West is on the rise. In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and 20 Latin American countries have also expressed their support, and France may also take the same attitude. Argentina and Canada are almost certain to be elected as the other two non-permanent members of the Security Council.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 30th Dispatch] In addition to discussing and approving the accession of Pakistan and Yemen to the United Nations today, the General Assembly will also conduct the re-election of the three members of the Security Council. According to diplomatic circles' predictions, although Czechoslovakia itself is unwilling, it is expected to be elected as a member of the Security Council, otherwise the Soviet Union will inevitably be isolated in the Council.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly today will elect a member of the Security Council to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of Bajimlin. Forty-eight hours ago, it was generally believed that Argentina was expected to be elected with the strong support of the American countries, but the situation changed abruptly on the eve of the election. The Latin American countries, dissatisfied with the Peron regime and Argentina's disregard for the previous General Assembly resolution, refused to recall its ambassador to Spain, and are prepared to elect Uruguay. This election is scheduled to be held at 4 p.m. today, standard time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 29th Dispatch] The Security Council continued to discuss the applications of Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland for membership today, but no formal decision was made on any application. Representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom stated that they did not support the applications of Hungary and Bulgaria, because the current governments of these two countries suppressed civil rights and basic freedoms. The Soviet Union also clearly stated that if the Security Council made an unfavorable decision on the applications of Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, and Finland, the Soviet Union would also veto Italy's application. The United Kingdom criticized the Soviet Union's position as an attempt to make an "improper transaction," and Australia also criticized its statement as inconsistent with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, because the Charter stipulates that each application should be decided according to its own merits.</p>
<h3>Pakistani Representative Delivers First Speech Willing to Cooperate in Promoting Favorable International Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 30th Dispatch] Pakistani Chief Representative Khan, in a speech at the UN ceremony authorizing Pakistan's formal accession to the United Nations today, expressed dissatisfaction with the major powers' failure to agree. He said that two years have passed since the end of World War II, but the world is still seeking peace, and it seems difficult to grasp. The major countries that concentrated their resources and intelligence to win the war seem unable to establish a frank and sincere agreement on the basis of peace. On behalf of my government, I assure the United Nations that Pakistan will do its utmost to promote better understanding between countries, to achieve and maintain lasting peace. He continued that, in fact, Pakistan is a part of India, and the latter was a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles and a founding member of the League of Nations. Therefore, Pakistan is not a new member of the United Nations, but a successor to a founding member. Although Pakistan's participation in the United Nations is only a formality, we believe that this represents Pakistan's trust in the principles of the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Eastern European Exiled Leaders Petition the United Nations</h3>

<h3>Southern Anti-Communist Elements Active Holding Hong Kong District Situation Chaotic</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Trieste, 29th Dispatch] The situation here is extremely chaotic. Except for the absence of civil war, all kinds of unrest are almost completely present, and it is further complicated by the new political movement of White Slavs. The Pan-Slavic movement was launched by local democratic groups and Yugoslavs who fled from the territory of the Tito government, and its only concrete policy is to oppose the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>US Senate Armed Services Committee Sends Personnel to Europe for Inspection Will Hold Important Consultations with British Dignitaries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Robertson revealed that members of the Committee may request to meet with British Prime Minister Attlee and others to discuss plans for Germany, Palestine, and the Mediterranean region. These personnel are scheduled to depart for Europe on Tuesday to inspect the US troops stationed in Europe.

<h3>Truman Urges Congress to Aid Europe Vandenberg Responds First Decides to Convene the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Immediately</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York, 30th Broadcast: Washington News, Senator Vandenberg will convene the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 10 to consider the urgent issue of European aid. Vandenberg said: The current issue is actually the question of whether mankind can continue to survive freely. Truman's proposed European relief plan is different from the Marshall Plan, but there are various similar factors between the two, only the emphasis is slightly different.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] President Truman today called on congressional leaders to promote the European aid plan, but said that the issue of convening a special session of Congress remains to be decided. After the President and congressional leaders held a meeting at the White House, they hurriedly summoned a group of reporters and issued the following statement: He has asked the Appropriations and Foreign Relations Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to meet as soon as possible to discuss the urgent need to aid Western Europe. If the committees unanimously agree to convene a special session of Congress, there will be no problem in convening it. In any case, his position remains unchanged, that is, he will convene it when necessary.</p>
<p>European Aid Funds Will Soon Be Exhausted</p>
<p>The existing European aid funds can only support until December 1, and that is the minimum amount. After that, the aid funds will be exhausted. Before March 31 next year, another 580 million US dollars must be allocated to assist France, Italy, and Austria. This amount is already so small that it cannot be reduced any further. He cannot use any administrative power to allocate this money. The current situation in the United Kingdom does not seem as serious as in the above three countries. The President also replied to a reporter's question that Belgium and the Netherlands were able to cope with their needs in the past, and it seems that they can still do so in the future.</p>
<h3>Egypt and Two Other Countries Suggest Banning Jewish Immigration into the Holy Land</h3>
<p>(This Newspaper News) New York, 30th Broadcast: Lake Success News, Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon suddenly submitted a proposal to the General Assembly today, advocating that Jewish immigration continue to be banned from entering Palestine. These three countries believe that the continued entry of immigrants is sufficient to disrupt friendly relations between countries. The proposal was submitted before the deadline. After the deadline, it is not possible to request that the new proposal be included in the agenda.</p>
<p>France and Italy Face the Most Urgent Crisis</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch) President Truman openly expressed his concerns when discussing with congressional leaders, saying that unless France and Italy can get emergency aid from the United States, they will be swallowed up by communism. However, it is futile to convene Congress without first obtaining a guarantee of support for his plan. Congressional leaders doubt whether the Appropriations and Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives can complete the necessary research before December 1, because the members are now scattered all over the world, and many are personally investigating in Europe. It is questionable whether they can be recalled before December 15.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 29th Dispatch] According to the members who participated in the White House talks, Truman failed to obtain definite support from Republican leaders.</p>
<p>Secretary Marshall Gave a Detailed Report</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Lucas said that Secretary of State Marshall and Undersecretary Lovett gave detailed reports on the European economic situation at the White House meeting. House Republican Leader Halleck strongly stated that the Republican Party did not accept any specific agreement at today's meeting. Marshall left the White House after the members, and seemed very excited, but he refused to answer all questions from reporters.</p>
<h3>Partial Reorganization of the British Cabinet Cripps Appointed Minister of Economic Affairs Greenwood Retires, Morrison Succeeds Him</h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch) Prime Minister Attlee announced at midnight today the appointment of President of the Board of Trade Cripps as the new Minister of Economic Affairs, and transferred Secretary for Overseas Trade Wilson to succeed him as President of the Board of Trade. 10 Downing Street also announced the resignation of Minister Without Portfolio Greenwood. Cripps will take over the responsibility of directing domestic economic policy, which was previously held by Lord President of the Council Morrison.</p>
<p>The Minister of Economic Affairs has only a few staff members. In terms of work, he will be assisted by the original Central Planning Economic Bureau, Economic Intelligence Office, and the Economic Section of the Cabinet Secretariat. In addition, a Cabinet Economic Planning Committee will be established, chaired by Prime Minister Attlee, to handle major issues of domestic and foreign economic policy. Greenwood's resignation is the result of Prime Minister Attlee's desire to have younger members participate in the cabinet to replace older cabinet members. Morrison will succeed Greenwood as Minister Without Portfolio. Other cabinet changes, including the retirement of some older cabinet members, are expected to be announced on the weekend.</p>
<p>According to this agency's political reporter, Cripps' appointment as Minister of Economic Affairs, responsible for the unified command of economic policy, has the power to supervise and control the departments of commerce, supply, labor, fuel, power, and transportation. He will also work closely with Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, but he is in a parallel position to the Chancellor. Until now, the United Kingdom's economic planning has been the responsibility of two committees, one responsible for the domestic economy, chaired by Morrison, and one responsible for the foreign economy, chaired by Attlee. In the future, these two committees will technically still be chaired by Attlee, but in practice, they will usually be chaired by Cripps. Foreign Secretary Bevin will also join the Design Committee as a member.</p>
<h3>Soviet Writer Insults Truman The United States Protests to the Soviet Union Molotov Has Given a Straightforward Reply</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The State Department announced today that a Soviet writer wrote an article insulting President Truman, comparing the President to Hitler. The United States protested, but was rejected by the Soviet government. The article stated that Truman was vying for the laurels of the Munich Corporal (referring to Hitler) and represented Wall Street financiers in engaging in a "one-world" movement. The article also mocked Truman as a "messenger, bank clerk, and tool of the corrupt party."</p>
<p>The United States' protest to the Soviet Union was lodged by Ambassador Smith to the Soviet Union, saying that the American people, regardless of their political views, deeply regretted this kind of slander. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied that the Soviet government could not be responsible for this kind of writing, and could not accept the protest lodged by the Ambassador.</p>
<h3>MacArthur's Directive for Increased Coal Production; Japanese Cabinet to Formulate Concrete Measures; Aiming for an Annual Production of 40 Million Tons in Five Years</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Japanese government, having received directives from General MacArthur's headquarters regarding increased coal production, convened a cabinet meeting today to discuss concrete measures. The results of the meeting included decisions to:  prohibit producers from secretly selling directly to consumers; maintain coal prices without change; provide special allocations of materials to highly efficient producers as an incentive; and adopt a 24-hour, three-shift system for labor.</p>
<p>In addition, the Ministry of Labor proposed reducing or waiving the increased portion of income tax from increased production labor, to be borne by businesses, but the Ministry of Commerce and Industry opposed the burden being borne by businesses and advocated tax exemption. This opinion was not accepted by the Ministry of Finance, and it was decided to postpone the matter to the next cabinet meeting for further discussion. Furthermore, Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani, speaking on the directives from General MacArthur's headquarters, stated: The goal is to reach a production of 40 million tons by 1952, with an annual increase of 2 to 3 million tons. However, to increase coal production, national management is absolutely necessary, for the following reasons: planned production is essential; the actual situation can be fully understood; policy and actual circumstances can be aligned; and the allocation of materials and labor can be smoothly executed.</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Expand Labor Unrest; Ten Arrested; Order to Reorganize the Department Store Union in Three Districts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The public security authorities discovered that there were hidden elements of a criminal gang within the department store worker's union in the three districts. These elements were colluding with criminal gangs within the electricity and French-owned power unions to expand the situation. Recently, they were instigating New Sun Sun Company employees, exploiting the Lee Chak case to incite a general strike. As a result, yesterday morning, personnel were dispatched to arrest the main members of the union, including Chen Shih-chun (National Goods Worker), Ting Sheng-ya (Wing On Worker), Wang Shou-quan (National Goods Worker), Liang Ren- (Wing On Worker), Bu Bu-yun (Sincere Worker), Ma Chia-ching (Sincere Worker), Sun Shou-kang (Sincere Worker), Chou Heng (Little Luzon Worker), Mi Ren (Great New Worker), and Yao Chu-ming (Union Secretary), totaling ten people. They will be interrogated and dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Police Bureau issued an order to the department store worker's union in the three districts late last night, instructing them to immediately cease activities and send personnel for reorganization. The original order stated: "It has been discovered that since the cracking down of the communist bandit organization in this city, according to investigation results, many responsible persons of the union are also colluding with the bandit party, frequently causing disturbances.

We are dispatching Hsiang Sheng and 25 others as reorganization personnel, and designating Bureau Specialist Fang Min as the reorganization instructor. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are attaching a copy of the list of reorganization personnel, ordering you to comply and await reorganization. This order is issued."

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Refuses the Union's Demands; French Tramway Leaves the Factory Last Night; Partial Work Stoppage by Employees of the Electric Power Company</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] British trams resumed full operation yesterday. Under the persuasion of some union directors and supervisors, French-owned water and electricity workers also dispatched one red public bus and two Route 2 trams at 8:30 last night, but they were immediately driven back. According to the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, French companies may resume work today.</p>
<p>There are a total of seventeen directors and supervisors in the French-owned Water and Electricity Company's industrial union, twelve of whom the Social Affairs Bureau considers to be instigators of the labor unrest and has requested the company to dismiss. There are also four other workers whom the company has been requested to dismiss. The Social Affairs Bureau will also reorganize and restructure the union within days. French-owned water and electricity workers held a general meeting in the Lu Chia Wan factory yesterday morning, attended by more than 400 workers. The four directors and supervisors ordered to be dismissed, namely Ma Kuo-hua, Chang Hua-lin, Chou Feng-lin, and Liu Chen-ming, also attended. A joint declaration of the sixteen dismissed employees was also posted in the factory. Union Chairman Chu Chun-hsin, who had already gone into hiding, also had a letter to the workers posted on the wall. As a result of the meeting, the workers submitted the following conditions for resuming work to the Social Affairs Bureau: Release the three arrested workers, Tsou Pao-jung, Hsiung Tao-hung, and Tao Ah-er; guarantee not to reorganize the union; and rescind the dismissal order for the sixteen employees. The Social Affairs Bureau did not accept this. Director Wu stated that the Social Affairs Bureau has no power to release the arrested workers. Regarding the non-reorganization of the union, it can be considered if the workers resume work immediately.</p>
<p>The families of the arrested workers of the electric power company went to the old factory on Fei Lun Road, the Hai Fang Road substation, and the Yangchow Road substation yesterday to cause a commotion. Workers there gradually staged partial work stoppages. By 2:00 PM, more than 600 people had stopped working. The Yangpu General Factory was not affected. At 5:00 PM, union advisor Fan Tsai-kuei, along with union leader Wu Shih-shen, visited the director of the Social Affairs Bureau to report the situation and discuss countermeasures. According to Director Wu's statement to reporters: This worker's work stoppage was caused by someone deliberately spreading rumors that the government would continue to arrest workers. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately posted a notice at the company stating that, except for those listed in the previously announced list who have not yet been arrested, all other workers are protected and can work with peace of mind, and should not believe the rumors.</p>

<h3>Partial Work Stoppage and Strike in the Silk Weaving Industry in Districts Two and Three</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] The silk weaving industry in Districts Two and Three of this city previously implemented slow work due to dissatisfaction with the discount method determined by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee. However, yesterday, in addition to slow work, there were also partial work stoppages and strikes in each district. Some workers continued to work as usual, so the situation was not serious. Because the situation at the factory has improved, the workers are now demanding an adjustment in the discount. The Evaluation Committee will provide guidance to reach an agreement.</p>
<h3>Alleged Underground Bank; Hong Da Company's Accounts Confiscated</h3>

<h3>Four Public Utility Unions Resolved Yesterday to Demand Changes to the Index Calculation Method</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] Four of the six major public utility industrial unions in this city held a joint meeting yesterday. Those present included Chou Chang-chiang and Cheng Yang-tien from British Tramway; Chou Fu-chiang, Chang Yi-kang, and Yang Chung-fang from British Waterworks; Chang Tzu-heng, Chang Sen, Yueh Chia-chin, Chin Yu-lin, and Lu Tsung-jun from British Gas; and Liang Yung-chang, Ni Hsi-jung, Chang Wan-kang, and Chou Chung-ching from American Telephone, totaling more than ten people. American Power and French Water and Electricity did not participate due to recent labor unrest. The meeting was chaired by Liang Yung-chang and resolved: Express dissatisfaction with the September worker's cost of living index published by the municipal government. The cost of living index should not be based on the prices of rationed goods, as workers cannot rely entirely on rationed goods to live. For example, coal briquettes and cooking oil have never been received. The rationed rice is not only insufficient in quantity but also of extremely poor quality, mixed with a lot of powder and bran. Therefore, it is requested that the municipal government and the Federation of Labor Unions use actual market prices when compiling the index. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, half-month's wages were issued in advance, originally scheduled for one-time deduction. However, because the cost of living index was unexpectedly low, it is requested that the company management, based on the spirit of labor-management cooperation, deduct the amount in two installments. Regarding the proposal to establish joint worker welfare programs among the six public utility companies, a written request was sent to the company management last week to send representatives to discuss the matter together with the union. However, the company management has not yet responded. It was decided that the responsible persons of each union will submit a request to the relevant company authorities separately tomorrow. Expressing regret that the labor unrest at American Power and French Water and Electricity has affected the entire union organization and the welfare of all workers due to a few bad elements, expressing great sympathy for the workers.</p>
<h3>Credit Cooperatives Lose Their Essence Without Issuing Checks; Yu Nan-chiu, Chiang Chien-pai, and Pu Ching File Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Shanghai's credit cooperatives gathered yesterday to unanimously express their opposition to the reported Ministry of Finance ban on credit cooperatives issuing checks. They elected Yu Nan-chiu and Chiang Chien-pai as representatives to go to Peking for discussions and prepare for administrative litigation. According to Chiang Chien-pai: Credit cooperatives are legally entitled to issue checks. According to Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Cooperative Law: "Credit cooperatives, in order to promote the circulation of finance, shall lend necessary funds for production or manufacturing to members and accept deposits from members."</p>
<p>Article 2 of the Banking Law states: "The term 'banking business' as used in this law refers to the following items: (1) Receiving various types of deposits, (2) ... (3) Handling various types of loans...." Referring to the provisions of the two laws above, it is sufficient to prove that credit cooperatives are legally engaged in monetary business. Only the monetary business of credit cooperatives is limited to their members. Their status as a monetary business is completely certain. Article 18 of the Banking Law stipulates that "Anyone who regularly receives currency or funds, regardless of whether the method of receiving is by issuing checks, deposit slips, receipts, account books, promissory notes, or other similar evidentiary documents, shall be deemed to be engaged in banking business." Checks, deposit slips, receipts, account books, and promissory notes are all considered banking business. Even if credit cooperatives do not use checks, they must still use deposit slips, account books, etc., which is still banking business. Therefore, no matter how it is interpreted, the fact that credit cooperatives are monetary businesses cannot be denied. Being monetary businesses, they can naturally issue checks. The issuance of checks by credit cooperatives involves three types of laws: Cooperative Law, Banking Law, and Negotiable Instruments Law. The Ministry of Finance cannot disregard the Cooperative Law on which credit cooperatives are based and hastily assume that credit cooperatives are non-monetary businesses that cannot issue checks. Moreover, checks are an important tool for modern financial circulation. The greater the financial credit, the wider the use of checks, and the greater the need for them. If credit cooperatives cannot issue checks, then credit cooperatives will lose their essence, and the provisions of the Cooperative Law regarding the establishment of credit cooperatives would be meaningless.</p>
<h3>More Than Decade-Old Lost Child Case; Orphanage Requests Retrial</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] More than a decade ago, the orphanage association took in a lost child who had come to Shanghai from Kiukiang. The child stayed at the association for less than half a year and was then taken away by someone to be raised.

<h3>Li Ze Still Sentenced to Three Years; Expressed Disagreement in Court</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Li Ze, the General Manager of the New-New Company, was accused of serving as a director of the puppet merchants' association and suspected of being a traitor. He was previously sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court. After the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial, he was sentenced again by the High Court yesterday. More than one hundred employees of the New-New Company arrived in court to listen to the proceedings around 9:00 AM. At 9:20 AM, Judge Xiao, along with two judges, Chen Zhensheng and Han Shuzhi, took their seats and brought Li Ze to the court. Li was wearing a light gray "派力司" (Pallis) long gown and glasses on his nose. Judge Xiao stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Li Ze, colluding with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to three years in prison, deprived of civil rights for three years, and property confiscated, except for a reasonable amount for the family's necessary living expenses."</p>
<p>Judgment Rationale</p>
<p>After sitting down, he briefly stated the reasons for the judgment: "The enemy established the Merchants' Association to purchase and control materials. The defendant's position as a director of the association was clearly detrimental to this country and beneficial to the enemy. As for the contact with the Military Intelligence Bureau, why was it not stated in the first trial, but only after the retrial? This raises doubts. The original sentence of three years is appropriate, so the original sentence is upheld. If you disagree, you can apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment." After hearing this, Li expressed his disagreement. The defense attorney requested the court to allow bail, submitting a written request for a ruling. Li was still taken back into custody.</p>

<h3>Shooting Fights on Nanjing Road; One Robber Killed, Two Children Injured</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Jin Xingyuan, the old clerk of the Da Mao Textile Enterprise Company at 264 Beijing Road, second floor, was ordered to withdraw 10 million yuan in legal tender from the An Yu Qian Zhuang in Xingren Lane, Ningbo Road, around 3:00 PM yesterday. He took it to Zhang Bingfa's tin shop at 139 Tianjin Road to buy tinplate. While he was inquiring about the price, two robbers jumped out from behind, trying to seize the legal tender. Jin struggled and was hit in the back of the head with a pistol butt. The robbers then fled with the money. Despite his injuries, Jin followed closely behind. When they reached the entrance of Xiangkang Lane, a news vendor, Feng Guanlong, tried to stop the robbers. The robbers fired a shot into the sky. When they fled to the vicinity of the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road, a car transporting money from the Foch Road branch of the Guangzhong Bank happened to be there. The bodyguard, Hu Longfu, saw the situation and jumped down to chase them. The robbers fired two shots in a row, but fortunately, they all missed. When they reached the intersection of Shanxi Road and Nanjing Road, one robber fled south on Shanxi Road, while the other fled west along Nanjing Road. The bodyguard, together with the police officer from post number 1542 nearby, fired three shots in front of the Guanxin Hat Shop at 460 Nanjing Road. The robber also fired two shots in return, but none hit. At the same time, the patrol police chief number 2044 from the Lao Zha sub-bureau also joined the battle, firing two shots in a row, hitting one robber in the left chest and right waist. He fell to the ground and died. Five million yuan of the original stolen money was found in his possession. When the bullets were flying, two apprentices, Chen Bajin (17 years old, from Changzhou) and Xin Xiaogou (18 years old, from Changzhou), from Liu Yongxing's engraving shop at 777 Fangbang Road, were hit by stray bullets in their right and left calves, respectively. They, along with the injured victim Jin Xingyuan, were sent to the hospital. The robber's body was taken to the coroner's office for examination, and the other robber is still being pursued.</p>
<h3>Yuan Ludeng's Retrial Sentence; Reduced to Seven Years; Smiles Upon Hearing the Verdict</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Old Men of Shanghai," was accused of serving as the director of the puppet Rice and Grain Control Committee and other positions. He was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court, but the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial, which has now concluded. The case was sentenced again in the High Court yesterday. At 9:40 AM, Judge Liu Yugui, along with two judges, Chen Zhensheng and Qiu Huanying, and prosecutor Yang Shoucheng, took their seats and brought Yuan to the court. Yuan was wearing a dark gray "派力司" (Pallis) long gown and round-rimmed tortoiseshell glasses on his nose. Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Yuan Ludeng, colluding with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to seven years in prison, deprived of civil rights for seven years, and property confiscated, except for a reasonable amount for the family's necessary living expenses." Then he sat down and explained the reasons for the judgment: "The defendant served as the director of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, which he himself admitted, and the Supreme Court has no doubts about this. The reason for the reduced sentence on retrial is that the defendant rescued many underground workers during the occupation of Shanghai, and Huang Hanzhi, Yu Bingjian, and others testified in court, which can be believed. Furthermore, the defendant has been engaged in charitable work in Shanghai for many years, and the circumstances warrant a reduction. If you disagree, you can apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment." Yuan smiled and nodded upon hearing the verdict, saying "Good, good!" After requesting permission to see his family, he was taken back into custody.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Fund; Fundraising Period Expires</h3>
<p>This time, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this newspaper and the publication of the 25,000th issue, we specially organized the "Reader Scholarship Fund." On the one hand, it is for celebration, and on the other hand, it is for relief. Celebration is "adding flowers to the brocade," and relief is "sending charcoal in the snow." Now, we are combining these two extremes, merging them into the same goal, that is, we are celebrating our anniversary by "rescuing those who are out of school," and at the same time, we are rescuing a large number of out-of-school youth by "celebrating our anniversary." From August 22nd to September 30th, we worked hard for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" for forty days. Every day, we appealed in the newspaper and ran around in the scorching sun, but we had a common goal, which was to rescue those who are out of school.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and forty days passed in a blink of an eye. The deadline for raising donations for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" has finally arrived, but the work of reviewing and awarding will continue for a considerable period of time. At the same time, we must also review the past achievements as a reference for the future.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish many young people who have received our help that they can work harder to study and research, so that morality, intelligence, and physical fitness can leap forward!</p>

<h3>City Council Adjourns; Will Reconvene in One Month; Councilors' Opinions Differ; Hatton Garden Case Reserved</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Municipal Council's fourth general meeting held a seven-day meeting, which adjourned at 8:00 PM last night. The adjourned meeting will be held in one month, and the main task is to review the city's budget for the 37th year.

The other is the "Proposal to requisition the garden as a permanent park for the city" submitted by Fang Rusheng and 58 other senators. Councilors have different opinions on this case. Zhang Nai first explained the reasons for the requisition on behalf of the four groups, saying: According to national land policy, private individuals should not have such a large garden. Article 208 of the Land Law stipulates that the state may expropriate private land in accordance with the provisions of this law for the needs of transportation undertakings, public utilities, public health, etc. Requisitioning Hatton Garden requires less cost and is easier to succeed. The garden covers an area of 170 acres and only requires 12 billion yuan. Lu Shidao continued, saying that the City Council should not rashly take responsibility for this case. We have not yet seen how Mrs. Hatton's will actually states. If George Hatton donates 15 acres, will he no longer be asked to lend any more? Wu Zhengque opposed the entire requisition, saying that although there are regulations in the Land Law, attention should be paid to the point that "it should be limited to what is necessary for its business." Is it "necessary" to requisition Hatton Garden? Deng Chuan praised the establishment of a library on 15 acres of land. Jiang Hao suggested that the handling method be reserved. Finally,</p>
<p>The Mayor Explained</p>
<p>That the municipal government had consulted with George Hatton in order to implement the councilors' resolution, but the other party refused to rent it. Therefore, I had to report to the City Council for a decision. I believe that since George Hatton is willing to donate land and automatically build a library, the municipal government can be said to be effortless, so it can concentrate its efforts to negotiate the requisition of the racecourse, which is more beneficial to us. Later, Speaker Pan reported that the council had never passed a resolution on "requisitioning." The resolution of the first general meeting was "leasing," and the third general meeting was a proposal. There are the words "requesting a loan" in the proposal, but the resolution was in accordance with the resolution of the first general meeting. As a result, after the General Assembly voted, all the Mayor's submission for deliberation and the Councilors' temporary motions were "reserved."</p>
<p>Case of Selecting Education Director Reserved; Municipal Teachers College Attacked Again</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The council yesterday discussed several more temporary proposals. Chen Boliang and Chen Baotai proposed "Requesting the Mayor to quickly select a Director of Education for the city to improve the city's education," according to Chen Boliang's explanation, that the city's educational administration has been abnormally neglected for two years. Please ask the Mayor to quickly select a person of high moral standing and rich experience in educational administration to take office.</p>
<p>In addition to mentioning this case, Chen Baotai also submitted evidence again to expose the Municipal Teachers College's false reporting of the number of students and classes, with a very激昂 attitude. Later, Mayor Wu explained that the appointment of the Education Director should be handled by the Executive Yuan through the Ministry of Education. As for the investigation of corruption, the municipal government has a responsibility to handle it. If it can be verified, it guarantees a thorough and severe investigation. The withdrawal of this proposal is requested.</p>
<p>Acting Education Director Li said that he admitted that there have been problems with the city's education in the past two years, but that some events cannot be blamed entirely on the Education Bureau. I will never compete for the position of the new Director. Finally, regarding the case of the Municipal Teachers College, he repeatedly stated that Principal Dong Renjian did not engage in corruption.</p>
<p>Final Resolution: Chen Boliang's proposal was "reserved," and the case of the Municipal Teachers College was sent to the municipal government for investigation and severe punishment according to law.</p>
<p>Gasoline Refueling Method Passed; Trial Implementation for One Month Starts Today</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The gasoline refueling method was amended and approved by the City Council's Public Utilities Committee yesterday morning and the General Assembly in the afternoon as follows. It was decided to start a trial implementation for one month from today: All types of motor vehicles must fill up their fuel tanks each time, at most once every three days, or ten times a month. Motorcycles must not exceed one gallon of gasoline per refueling, small cars must not exceed ten gallons, and trucks must not exceed twenty gallons. If the amount of gasoline used by trucks and commercial vehicles is insufficient, the car dealer may state the facts according to the actual situation, and after certification by the industry association, submit a request to the Public Utilities Bureau to form another committee for detailed review. Gasoline stations and drivers who hoard gasoline or engage in black market transactions will be immediately suspended from supply and will be sent to the court for investigation according to the seriousness of the circumstances.</p>
<p>Demolition of Houses on Tianmu Road; Decision to Implement in Stages Within Six Months</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the demolition of old houses along Tianmu Road to widen the road, it was originally decided to demolish them before the 15th of October. Chen Baotai and others temporarily proposed "Extending the demolition by six months," which was resolved by the General Assembly yesterday as "Maintaining the original intention and implementing it in stages within six months by the municipal government."</p>
<p>Also passed a temporary motion: Lu Yinchu and others proposed "Please provide spiritual and material assistance to the city's volunteers to encourage them." Tao Baichuan and others proposed that the municipal government promptly and effectively implement the central government's recently promulgated measures to deal with the Communist Party in the rear to end chaos and secure the area.</p>

<h3>Changzhou Uncovers Secret Bandit and Communist Organizations; Overlapping Secret Rooms, Freely Opening and Closing, Like Honglian Temple; A Large Number of Documents Found in Chicken Coops; Now Following Clues</h3>
<p>[Reported from Wujin on the 28th] The district chief of the sixth district in the eastern township of this county, Guan Jie, recently led self-defense team members in the village of Xiaoliu, uncovering a secret organization led by Sun Wenxuan and Communist forces. The simple, twisted story reads like a legend of Honglian Temple. Here is an account of what happened:</p>
<p>Bandit problems have been common in the area, the local office of the director of the Bandit and Puppet Wu Nan Garrison, Lu Daonan, frequents the area. The district office recently received reports and clues, learning that Sun Wenxuan in the village of Xiaoliu was harboring Bandit and Puppet forces. On the night of the 25th of this month, he led over 20 members of the self-defense squadron and special agents, armed, to the village of Zhuji on Xiaoliu. The villagers were all asleep. Without a sound, they confined the tenant farmers in one room and searched the house. Only an old man lived in the house, named Sun Guifu, who was already seventy years old, with poor eyesight and hearing. The rest were tenant farmers. The house was large, with over ten rooms, arranged in a winding fashion. After searching for over an hour, there were no suspicious signs. Gradually reaching the kitchen, they found a side door. Opening it led to a small alley. There was a locked double room a short distance away. They broke in. The room was fully furnished with a bed and cabinet. Then, behind the bed, they discovered a secret room with a rope mechanism to open and close it. There was a wooden board similar to a door or window on the wall. Pulling it open allowed only one person to enter. The room was pitch black, with only one bed and one stool. The bed curtains were all red. After searching, they found items for arson and ammunition. They also found assembly rope. The secret room door could be opened and closed freely, like the flexible mechanism in Honglian Temple. At 3 a.m., they summoned the local Baojia head and most of the villagers woke up from their dreams, coming to witness. They were all amazed. On the 26th, more personnel were dispatched to move all the furniture in the room and inspect it one by one. They found a large number of secret documents and a large number of grain requisition lists in a chicken coop. There were also anti-currency and many rifle bullets. It is said that there is still a secret cellar in the house, containing a lot of military supplies and firearms. The district office is following the clues. The search continued on the 27th and 28th.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Hangzhou Bay</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 29th Dispatch] By chance, our reporter and Mr. Tian Han were introduced to Mr. Xu Huijun, the chief of the Hangzhou Engineering Office of the First District Bureau of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications. Through his introduction, we also met Mr. Liang Qiang, the director of the First District Bureau, Cheng Lin, a technician of the Highway Administration, Chen Zujun, the chief engineer of the District Bureau, Peng Shude, the chief of the Engineering Section, and Mr. Lai Zishu, an engineer. They were going to inspect the entire highway of Hangzhou Bay. Mr. Tian Han was the first to volunteer to join this trip, and the reporter was also invited to join.</p>
<p>The First District Bureau of the Highway Administration is in charge of the highways of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The highway transportation between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou depends entirely on their efforts. Hangzhou Bay normally starts from the Jin Sinang Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, passing through Zhapu, Haiyan, Haining, Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Baiguan, and reaching Guanhaiwei. Opening the map of the Republic of China, it happens to be on the edge of a small corner at the bottom of the eastern end of this begonia leaf. This is the Oriental Grand Port planned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the gap where the enemy - Japan - first invaded East China and Central China, and also the trading ground for civilian commerce. We first depart from Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Crossing the Qiantang River Bridge</p>
<p>Passing through Xiaoshan to Shaoxing. Two sections of the Qiantang River Bridge's motor vehicle lane are filled with wood. Director Liang Qiang, a highly experienced 61-year-old, believes that more asphalt and paint should be applied to prevent it from being destroyed. We are taking the old Xiaoshan road, which has some bumps. After passing Xiaoshan, the road becomes much flatter. The Xiaoshao Highway was originally a famous and good highway, but the bridges are still temporarily made of wood. On the road, we saw the farmers still climbing on the waterwheels, stepping on them to pump water into their fields. I looked again at the parched crops, and then at the river next to the road. In such an environment, the crops should be saved, but because the supply of manpower is insufficient and the water demand is too large, the harvest of these rice crops will not be very good. Shaoxing is currently building a stone towpath to facilitate boats pulling cables. After arriving in Shaoxing, the reporter and Mr. Tian Han visited the ancient Yue city.</p>
<p>One of Shaoxing's three famous products, tin foil, is still being smuggled very actively. If it is not carried on the car, it is carried on the boat, which is really difficult to prevent. It is said that most of these smugglers are wearing military uniforms. Another famous product, rice wine, has been produced less recently due to heavy wine taxes. Moreover, because Shaoxing people are making Shaoxing wine everywhere, foreign sales have also been affected. Speaking of freshwater fish, it is relatively quiet recently; winter and spring are the prosperous periods. Mr. Tian and the old reporter toured the streets, trying their best to look for traces of the King of Yue who once slept on firewood and tasted gall, just like searching for ancient treasures. They also wanted to see this famous area where talents are born, and the former residences of the great educator Cai Yuanpei and the great writer Lu Xun. On the street, there were only a few small bookstores with not many books inside. If you want to buy some local products, apart from fragrant cakes, there is nothing else to buy. Many items are foreign, and the price is more expensive than in Shanghai and Hangzhou. The famous Yue Opera here is not as good as the performances in Shanghai. We went to East Lake for a遊玩. Mr. Tian抢着 wanted to row a boat. The bottom of this kind of boat is very narrow and is rowed by both hands and feet. If you are not careful, it will capsize. I heard that East Lake is very deep. Fortunately, he is skilled. He visited Tao Gong Cave and then Xiantao Cave. Although most of it is man-made, the cliffs are tens of feet high, which is quite interesting. It is a pity that the houses built by the lake are mostly damaged.</p>

<p>From Shaoxing, we went to Baiguan, and the highway is still very good.</p>
<p>An aerial view of the Qiantang River (photo by Xu Bochuan)</p>
<p>Arriving at the Baiguan Ferry</p>
<p>is the location of Cao'e Town in Cao'e River. The Cao'e River was originally called Shun River, which is the "Shun" in Yao and Shun. At that time, he controlled the water and diverted the river flow into Hangzhou Bay, so it was used to commemorate him. Later, because of the filial daughter Cao E, who threw herself into the river to save her father, it was renamed to its current name. Crossing the river is Baiguan Town. There is a large temple in the town, and many houses are supported by stone pillars, which shows the long history of the building. However, the temple has not been整理, and it is凌乱 and惨败, which is not the phenomenon that should be present when commemorating the ancestors. Baiguan Town is about three miles long, and there are also many shops selling 洋货. Most of the shops sell salty seafood, because it is near the sea. The engineers are planning to restore</p>
<p>Baiguan to Zhouxiang</p>
<p>The highway. If the road is通, it will no longer be necessary to borrow the old Hang甬 Railway, and this road can lead to Guanhaiwei, and from Guanhaiwei to Yin County, which will bring many conveniences to commercial transportation and also have great values for national defense. They are carefully planning how to standardize this highway and how to reduce curves without the highway having to accommodate bridges.</p>
<p>Returning to Shaoxing from Baiguan渡江, I also cared about Shaoxing's grain this year. I asked the local people, and they told me that Shaoxing is a grain-deficient county. This year is乾旱. The fields near the river are fine, but the fields not near the river are finished. Shaoxing does not have any new-style hotels. There are mosquitoes and bedbugs in the旅店, and Mr. Tian and the reporter did not sleep well all night.</p>

<h3>NANTUNG NOTES: THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATES LOANS OF 400 TO 500 MILLION YUAN; THE TEMPORARY CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY ORGANIZES AN INSPECTION TEAM; REPORTER ADOPTS AN ANTI-BLOCKADE APPROACH</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nantong 27th Dispatch] County Magistrate Shen Naigeng is extremely busy since taking office. Autumn grain urgently needs funds, so he personally issued orders to speed up the collection of donations and taxes, and personally negotiated loans of 400 to 500 million yuan with Dasheng Textile Mill, the Chamber of Commerce, and the County Bank.

<h3>JINGJIANG LACKS ACCUMULATED GRAIN ORDER COUNTY MAGISTRATE TO COMPENSATE</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 30th Telegraph] Zhang Zhuan, the Magistrate of Jingjiang County, levied a 10% surcharge on grain during the 1946 land tax collection. Without approval, he arbitrarily converted it into cash. After the collection, he did not purchase grain for storage in a timely manner but instead deposited the cash in commercial firms to earn interest. Later, due to severe price fluctuations, it was impossible to replenish the grain, resulting in a shortage of several hundred shi of the collected amount. After an investigation by the Jiangsu Provincial Land Tax and Grain Management Office, Order No. 2758 from the 36th Army was used to quickly purchase and store the grain, and the County Magistrate Zhang Zhuan was held responsible for compensating the missing amount. Furthermore, Zhang Zhuan recently ordered the departments of the County Government not to directly release news but to have the news liaison officer be solely responsible. He has appointed Zhang Lintang as the news liaison officer of Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province. This person published an advertisement in the Jingjiang Daily (September 25th), which roughly stated: "To the special correspondents of various newspapers outside the county: The news liaison mechanism of this county has been established under orders. In addition to establishing close contact with various newspapers, news agencies, and news practitioners in this county, all special correspondents of various newspapers outside the county, whose names and addresses are unknown, have not yet been contacted. To promote the development of the news industry and establish contact, it is hoped that the special correspondents responsible for various newspapers outside the county will come to the Personnel Office of the County Government for a discussion or inform us of their names, addresses, and the newspapers they are responsible for so that we can contact them. Zhang Lintang, News Liaison Officer of Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province." It is learned that local news circles believe that this measure has the suspicion of blocking news from the County Government, so they have unanimously expressed great dissatisfaction.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau and Other Institutions Collaborate with Major Universities to Plan the Establishment of Student Cafeterias, Aiming to Provide Affordable Goods to Benefit 30,000 Students</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, most colleges and universities in the city had economic cafeterias attached to them by the Executive Yuan, which greatly benefited impoverished students. Now, due to the Executive Yuan's closure, the economic cafeterias have successively shut down. At a time when prices are soaring, students' financial burdens are limited. Mayor Wu, recognizing this, decided that the local government should find ways to remedy the situation and plans to establish "Youth Cafeterias" in colleges and universities throughout the city, with the Social Service Department of the Social Affairs Bureau taking charge. These cafeterias will offer affordable supplies such as rice, coal, oil, salt, vegetables, fish, and meat to the schools, so that they will not face increased difficulties due to price fluctuations, and students will not face increased burdens due to expensive goods, preventing malnutrition and ensuring that over 30,000 college and university students in the city receive real benefits. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Shen Naizheng, Counselor of the Municipal Government, and Li Ximou, Acting Director of the Police Bureau, jointly convened responsible persons from colleges and universities in the city at the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss implementation matters. Those in attendance included representatives Peng Zhenqiu from the Director, Counselor Shen, and Acting Director Li, Xie Dahuang from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Cao Jun from the Youth League, as well as representatives from the Municipal Physical Education College, Shanghai Law College, Wuxi National College, Southeast Medical College, Shanghai College of Law and Politics, Wusong Merchant Marine Vocational School, National Kindergarten Normal School, Nantong College, Shanghai Art College, Tongde Medical College, Shanghai Business College, Jiaotong University, Zhen旦 University, Soochow University, Daxia University, Guanghua University, Tongji University, Datong University, and Fudan University, totaling 26 individuals. Director Wu, as chairman, elaborated on the importance of establishing Youth Cafeterias, after which representatives from each school successively expressed their opinions. After discussion, the "Brief Rules for Service of the Shanghai Social Service Department's Special Distribution Stations for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias in Colleges and Universities" and "Measures for Distributing Affordable Goods" were approved. Within three days, each school will designate one staff member and student representatives to be responsible for cafeteria matters and will notify the Social Service Department of this list. The Department will then convene the responsible personnel from each school's Youth Cafeteria to discuss all implementation methods. The affordable supplies will be distributed according to a quantitative allocation method, and the local government will be responsible for subsidizing the transportation costs required for the government to purchase supplies from the market. The approved Brief Rules for Service of the Distribution Stations for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias and Measures for Distributing Affordable Goods are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Measures for Distributing Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias: This department, for the sake of assisting impoverished students, has specifically established distribution stations in colleges and universities to handle the sale of affordable goods through Youth Cafeterias. Each school's service distribution station is limited to establishing one Youth Cafeteria, except for cases where the various colleges and departments are not located in the same place and are far apart, in which case separate facilities may be established. Schools requesting the allocation of affordable goods must submit a roster of students who will participate in the dining program and must be certified by the school authorities. The distribution methods for various affordable goods will be determined separately by this department. The required quantity of affordable goods for each school's Youth Cafeteria should be calculated based on the need for affordable goods. For the sake of affordable goods, distribution stations will be temporarily established in suitable locations in Huxi, Hongkou, and Jiangwan. It is stipulated that each recipient unit purchase and receive the allocated goods from the designated distribution station from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM daily. If there are adjustments to the prices of affordable goods, notices will be posted at the distribution stations. Each school's Youth Cafeteria must submit a monthly report to this department on the financial situation, purchasing standards, and other items for verification. Those that are poorly managed will be ordered to rectify the situation or may be reorganized by this department in consultation with the school authorities. If necessary, the allocation may be suspended. The reporting format will be determined separately. These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Brief Rules for Service of the Distribution Stations for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias: Each distribution station will be managed by one employee assigned by the nearest service distribution station. The station address will be based on the principle of utilizing public spaces. The entrance of the distribution station must be marked with the words "Shanghai Social Service Department Special Distribution Station for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias in Colleges and Universities," and the prices of affordable goods must be posted inside the venue. The distribution time is from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM every day. For the allocation of rice, coal, and other items, payment must first be made to this department to obtain a certificate, which is then used to collect the goods from the distribution station. For the allocation of vegetables, meat, and other items, the goods must be purchased from the distribution station daily using a three-part certificate. The distribution station will stamp the connection lines and the quantity of goods and amount paid on each part, retaining the first and second parts. The first part will be kept at the station for verification, and the second part will be sent to this department weekly along with the payment. The third part will be retained by the purchasing cafeteria as a record. This department will settle accounts with the suppliers of affordable goods once a week. These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Flour Group Held Two Meetings in a Row Yesterday; Price Negotiation Adopts a Flexible Approach; Factory Flour Agreed to Be 180,000 Yuan Per Bag</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that when the price of flour in the city fluctuated in February, the Social Affairs Bureau restored the negotiated price of the flour group of the Municipal Price Review Committee. It was originally scheduled to hold a fair price evaluation once a week, but this city is not a wheat-producing area, and all raw materials required by the flour milling industry are dependent on other provinces. Therefore, the evaluation of flour prices is based on the price of wheat at the place of origin. However, the price of wheat at the place of origin has fluctuated greatly recently. If the evaluation is still carried out on a regular basis, coupled with the fluctuating price of wheat, the prices of flour and wheat may easily become disconnected. If the price of wheat at the place of origin is high but the price of flour in the city is low, manufacturers will not be able to import raw materials. Therefore, it has been decided that starting this week, a flexible approach will be adopted for flour price evaluation, and reasonable adjustments will be made at any time to ensure that the prices of raw materials and finished products are not disconnected.</p>
<p>The flour group of the Price Review Committee held its third and fourth review meetings at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively. Both were chaired by Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Department. The matters discussed at the third meeting in the morning were: The Fourth District Flour Industry Trade Union proposed that due to the rising price of wheat, the negotiated price was not enough to cover costs. Before the source of wheat in the city is unblocked and the price of wheat in the interior is not stable, it is proposed to temporarily suspend the flour price negotiation. It was resolved that in order to adapt to the times, flexible price negotiation will be adopted in the future, and this committee will make reasonable evaluations at any time according to the cost and a reasonable profit. Regarding the evaluation of flour prices, it was resolved that the factory flour price would be 180,000 yuan per bag, and the retail price should not exceed 187,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The fourth flour price review meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The chairman reported: The prices evaluated at the third review meeting in the morning have been announced and implemented, and the market price is lower than the limit price. Therefore, the situation is good. The purpose of convening the fourth review meeting this time is to determine the market price for tomorrow (ie, today, October 1st). Retailers should make daily reports on the purchase and sale of flour to prevent malpractices. Matters for discussion: Today (October 1st), the price of factory flour is 180,000 yuan per bag, and the retail price should not exceed 187,000 yuan. If the price of wheat fluctuates, a meeting will be convened at any time to evaluate the price of flour.</p>

At this time, there was a fierce dispute between bulls and bears in front of the yarn factory's counter.

<h3>Inventory Has Been Depleted; Wool Textile Industry Rushes to Rescue Raw Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association, due to the shortage of raw materials and the interruption of production, specially convened a board meeting yesterday and invited reporters. At the meeting, Ge Jiec臣, Ye Fokang, and others, standing directors of the association, gave speeches one after another, stating that the government's wool quota each time only covers 15% of the industry's needs. The raw materials stored in each factory have now been depleted. Therefore, they urgently hope that the government will: Grant licenses for wool that has arrived at the port and has been paid for. Grant licenses for wool that has been contracted and paid for. At the same time, they want to relax the future wool import quota to avoid the risk of the industry shutting down. The association has now established a raw materials rescue committee and decided to send representatives to Beijing within days to appeal to the relevant ministries and commissions to solve the raw materials crisis, creating panic.</p>
<h3>The Textile Construction Company Suspends Cotton Cloth Allocation; Cloth Merchants Request Reinstatement of Allotment; Textile Construction Agrees to Reconsider After Explanation from Merchants</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to Vice General Manager Wu of the China Textile Construction Company, suspending the allocation rights of over two hundred cloth merchants is actually beneficial to the entire cloth merchant industry. Indiscriminately reinstating the allocation rights of cloth businesses that have already been suspended, without distinguishing between right and wrong, would run contrary to the government's aim of supporting legitimate merchants. Furthermore, if any of the suspended merchants believe they have legitimate reasons for not being suspended, they can reapply, and the Textile Construction Company will expedite a review. However, if the cloth merchants continue to oppose the principle of upholding legitimate merchants, the Textile Construction Company will allocate the distribution rights to cloth merchants in various ports across the country.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company announced last Saturday that it was suspending the cotton cloth allocation of 205 cotton cloth businesses, causing widespread indignation and calls for opposition. Yesterday, coinciding with the Textile Construction Company's cargo release date, all merchants unanimously ceased taking delivery. Existing marked goods were also stopped as a result. Around 9 AM, the Cotton Cloth Association, fearing escalation, convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss solutions. It was decided to explain the situation to the Textile Construction Company and to dispatch Standing Director Gao Aizhou, Director Jiang Zhaozu, Director Wang Shixiang, and representatives of the suspended merchants, including Wu Zhensan and Zhi Ziqing, among others, to the company to request a prompt restoration of allotments to avoid disputes. Deputy Manager Wu Weijing of the Textile Construction Company received them, expressing regret for any inaccuracies in the investigation, stating that facts could be appealed and quickly re-investigated for remedy. He also hoped that the association could provide more assistance. After the representatives returned to the association, they attended a meeting of fellow merchants. Many merchants remained dissatisfied, and the representatives planned to visit the leaders of fellow merchants to appeal again.</p>
<p>Further news: The Textile Construction Company issued the following notice yesterday afternoon at 4 PM: "Merchants whose yarn and cloth allocation has been suspended according to this company's announcement on the 28th, if they believe they have legitimate reasons for not being suspended, may provide full details and relevant documents and send them to this company. We will expedite a review. If they meet the requirements, they will be reinstated. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw sluggish initial trading due to tight credit, with both local and out-of-town buyers showing little interest. More sellers than buyers resulted in a soft market. Later, some out-of-town buyers saw the low prices as attractive and bought, causing prices to recover slightly. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was down 1.5 million yuan compared to Saturday, 20-count Double Horse yarn dropped 900,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming yarn was down slightly at 1.1 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn all fell by 3-400,000 yuan to over 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially saw prices rise, but then declined as tight credit led to many sales and out-of-town buyers also became sellers. Ultimately, fine-headed cloth fell by 16,000 yuan compared to Saturday, and fine cloth such as Five Blessings Colored Balls and Blue Flannel also dropped by 2-3-400,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, coarse cloth, serge, and other items also uniformly declined.</p>
<p>Further news: The Textile Construction Company sold its usual Yang Flannel at 520,000 yuan, and Jumping Carp Yuan Guang twill at 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market saw scarce buyers due to tight credit, causing prices to decline further. Sentiment was weak, and trading was light, with around 500 bales changing hands. Delivered to factory prices: Ling Shi traded at 3.35 million yuan, Da Zhong Ji 330 bales, 175 bales traded. Delivered to warehouse prices: Ling Bao 3.23 million to 3.3 million yuan, 315 bales traded. Zhou Pu seed cotton 510,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Financial Firms Must Pay Reserve Funds; U.S. Treasury Bills Not Applicable</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance previously permitted financial firms to deposit short-term treasury bills in state banks to offset 50% of their deposit reserve requirement. However, since the value of treasury bills fluctuates according to market prices after conversion, they are not suitable for fixed reserve amounts. Therefore, starting yesterday, the measure of using treasury bills to offset reserve requirements has been canceled, and the previously deposited portion will be returned immediately.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices to be Adjusted Again</h3>
<p>Regarding the further adjustment of coal prices per catty, a responsible person from the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated on the 30th that, based on recent continuous increases in transportation labor costs and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, coal prices must be reasonably adjusted. The above matter has been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and is expected to be formally announced on October 1st.</p>
<h3>Salt Exports to Japan Suspended</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] In our country's barter trade with Japan, salt has been a major commodity. Since the Salt Administration submitted and received approval to cease using salt as barter goods in order to reduce salt taxes, the Central Trust Bureau's barter business has been greatly affected. Currently, the only remaining items for barter are sugar and mineral sands. However, it is understood that artificial silk raw materials needed by our country's industries can still be obtained from MacArthur's headquarters on a credit basis, so the supply will not be cut off.</p>
<h3>Many Seek Cash for Goods; Rayon Prices Decline; Factory Representatives' Asks Also Frequently Lowered</h3>
<p>The rayon market plummeted yesterday morning due to unusually tight credit among fellow merchants, who were selling goods to obtain cash. As a result, 120-count miscellaneous brand bright rayon, which initially asked for 6.5-6.6 million yuan at the opening, eventually sold for 4.6-4.7 million yuan. By noon, it had fallen further to 3.2-3.3 million yuan at closing. In the afternoon, after credit stabilized, those holding goods were no longer willing to sell cheaply, and some trading occurred at 5 million yuan. The final price rose again to 6 million yuan for sale, resulting in a loss of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory Representatives</p>
<p>The market was filled with cries yesterday, and asks were frequently lowered, but there was still a lack of trading. In the afternoon, prices stabilized slightly, with asks up 500,000 yuan from the morning. C-brand asked for 6 million yuan, and D-brand 5 million yuan, both down 500,000 yuan from the previous day. Traded prices ranged from 3 million to 4 million yuan. Thousand-count rayon was even more sluggish, with a sharper price decline.</p>
<p>Silk Goods</p>
<p>The market was steady yesterday. Although credit was tight among fellow merchants, the mood was better because various factories were either idling or on strike, reducing production daily. Da Cheng and Hua Qiang's silk quilt covers opened around 6.8 million yuan and rose steadily, with the highest trade at 7.3 million yuan. Later, due to falling raw material prices, they gradually retreated, closing at 7.02 million yuan for the immediate price, and 2.45 million yuan for deferred delivery. Checkered crepe asks remained at 61,000 yuan. Hua Jin crepe saw trading at 38,000 yuan for high-end goods yesterday due to the sharp decline in rayon. All goods showed some softness.</p>

<h3>Wang Xueliang Died at the Hands of the "Changshu Wolf"; Widow Cries for Information on the Time and Place</h3>
<p>To the Editor: On July 9, 1943, the enemy, led by the captain stationed in Changshu, "Mimura Haruki," simultaneously massacred civilians in the towns and villages of Taicang, involving Shanghai, Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Songjiang, Wujiang, and other places, totaling four to five hundred people. Among them, Wu Yufang and five others were shot first. Zheng Peiyun was released but then pursued and killed. My late husband, Wang Xueliang, and seventeen others have been missing ever since, their whereabouts unknown. Although the murderer has been brought to justice, and the accomplice Zheng Fengshi has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Jiangsu High Court, the date and place of martyrdom for my late husband and the other seventeen victims remain unknown. Some say it was at Dachang, others say it was at Gaojing Temple in Jiangwan, but these are just rumors with no supporting evidence. My late husband was born with completely white hair and was nearsighted. He was probably killed after March 2, 1944. If there is any kind person nearby who can remember the year and month and indicate the location, so that his bones can be returned, not only will the deceased rest in peace, but future generations will be eternally grateful. Correspondence address: "Wang Xuejun, Shanghai Telecom Bureau, corner of Sichuan Road and Fuzhou Road, Shanghai" or "Wang Ouyang Yunfang, Shatou Town, Taicang." I implore your public consideration.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Artist Han Leran, Who Died in a Plane Crash in Jiuquan</h3>
<p>— Jing Qi</p>
<p>In the summer of 1946, I accompanied Dean Yu on an inspection tour of Xinjiang and met Mr. Han Leran in Dihua. Dean Yu especially valued Leran, predicting that he would make a great contribution to our country's art. At the time, Leran had just returned to Dihua from the Baicheng area of southern Xinjiang, where he discovered many Tang Dynasty Buddhist paintings and historical sites. He was invited to go to southern Xinjiang again and readily agreed. For over half a month in southern Xinjiang, we traveled through more than ten counties and districts, often hearing him talk about his years of searching for Buddhist caves and excavating historical sites. He endured freezing cold and hunger, braving all kinds of dangers. Sometimes he got lost in the Gobi Desert, eating snow and drinking wind. Camel riders searched in all directions to find the way, eventually getting out of danger. It was like listening to an adventure story, and I was captivated. During the journey, he would often paint portraits of his companions, sometimes finishing them in a few strokes, capturing their essence perfectly. The group photo of his companions taken from the plane over the Tianshan Mountains was especially lifelike. After returning to Dihua, Leran exhibited over a hundred of his works from southern Xinjiang. The dozens of copies he made of the murals in the Buddhist caves were all painted by Tang Dynasty artists, clearly demonstrating the beginning of artistic exchange between China and the West. His initial oil and watercolor paintings depicted the people and customs of various ethnic groups, capturing them vividly, drawing sighs of admiration. This kind of exhibition was unprecedented in Dihua, and thousands of local people came to see it, making it a grand event. Dean Yu also appointed him as a specialist member of the Xinjiang District Supervisory Envoy's Office to encourage him. Last winter, he wrote from Lanzhou, saying that he planned to go to southern Xinjiang again this spring to continue his unfinished work and conduct systematic research. Last month, I received a letter from the Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves in Baicheng, dated June 22, detailing the general situation of his work and future aspirations. Unexpectedly, news reports stated that he went missing on the 31st while on a flight from Hami to Jiuquan. The news was reported to Dean Yu, who was deeply grieved. A telegram from Lanzhou yesterday stated that Leran was carrying his paintings from southern Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Leran was from the Northeast and studied painting in France. He returned to China after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and participated in political work, traveling to Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces for many years. He married after the victory. He then went to Dunhuang with Zhang Daqian to study Buddhist paintings and went to southern Xinjiang, Turpan, Kuqa, Baicheng, and other places to study and copy Tang Dynasty paintings in the Buddhist caves. He also excavated many Western Xia inscriptions. Because of his artistic talent, profound knowledge, research interests, strong will, and ability to endure hardship and danger, it was believed that he would contribute to the development of culture in the Northwest. Unexpectedly, his ambition was not fulfilled, and he suffered this disaster! This is not only a misfortune for the culture of the Northwest, but also a great loss for the art world of our country. I am now offering his letter for reference to those who are interested in ancient art, and I end with a few words in memory.</p>
<p>Attached</p>
<h3>Mr. Han Leran's Last Letter</h3>
<p>(Omitted above) After returning to Lanzhou from Xinjiang last year, I began preparations, which began to take shape in January of this year. Due to transportation issues, I left Lanzhou for Xinjiang on February 22, with two assistants, five students, and all the necessary equipment, arriving in Dihua on March 12. I originally planned to work in Turpan for a long time, but the local situation was chaotic, so I had to change my plans and go west.</p>
<p>I left Dihua on April 2 and arrived safely at the Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves in Baicheng on the 19th, discovering many ancient city ruins along the way. Because I had pre-arranged work, I could not excavate them immediately. After staying in Kuqa for six days, I went to Kumtura on the 16th for inspection. This is my second time coming here. This place is fifty miles away from the car, and there are high mountains on both sides. The Buddhist caves are on the right side of the mountain cliff. Because the mountain is formed by alluvial sand and gravel, it is easily weathered. Therefore, the sacred site of that day is a complete mess. The Wei Gan River in front of the cave is weeping, like mourning the past and feeling sad. At this time, I also felt a little sentimental.</p>
<p>Very few murals can still be seen in these Buddhist caves, no more than twenty at most. Even fewer are relatively intact, and the rest are broken and dilapidated. Most of the mural losses are man-made. Some were destroyed by the common people and tourists, and some were stripped away by foreign archaeological teams. They also systematically destroyed all Chinese characters, trying to destroy our culture and emphasize their own civilization. But they did not do it thoroughly enough. Many of the names of the Buddhas and the ancient explanations can still be seen vaguely in Chinese characters. According to my investigation, they are indeed works from the Tang Dynasty in our country. Our culture will eventually return to us, how can they destroy it?</p>
<p>The Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves, where I am currently working, are also where I worked last year. In our country, apart from the Dunhuang Buddhist Caves, there is nothing that can compare to it. Not only are there many caves and temples, but the works are also older, dating back at least 1,300 to 2,000 years. According to the results of sorting and numbering, there are a total of seventy-five caves with paintings, which are much more complete than Kumtura. But the stripping away by foreign archaeological teams is even more severe. Some have been completely taken. On the remaining incomplete paintings, one can still see the artistic spirit of the time. Not only is the composition precise and the coloring gorgeous, but attention is also paid to human anatomy and light and shadow contrast. Moreover, their religious thoughts and philosophical foundations are also expressed. This proves that the painters at that time were not ordinary craftsmen, but experts with thoughts and training. In a cave without Buddha paintings, there were anatomical drawings, which further proves the existence of art school-like facilities.</p>
<p>On June 2nd, a Kaiyuan coin from the Tang Dynasty was found in front of the first cave, indicating that the Han people had close contacts here at that time.</p>
<p>Because the equipment I am using is about to run out, I plan to return to Lanzhou on June 19th. I will conduct a review of this work, and I have copied more than 30 large and small oil paintings, almost all representing different periods. My other assistants and students have copied more than 30 kinds of patterns and paintings, and there are photographic reporters and other work. In the last two weeks, with limited funds, I have been excavating. Because there are many caves that have never been excavated. I hired thirteen workers and spent ten days cleaning up one cave. The harvest from this trial excavation was great. The murals were novel and not found in other caves. Except for a small part damaged by the earthquake, the rest were intact. Moreover, there are many ancient characters on the paintings, like the titles of the paintings and the names of people. This is what I have been hoping for, and it is valuable. In addition, I have also obtained many ancient decorations, faded wooden panel paintings, and partial sculptures. In order to finish copying the murals in the new cave, I had to extend it by one week. I am afraid that the new cave will be destroyed again, so I hired a carpenter to make a door and lock it, and handed it over to a local to manage. The Baicheng County Government also issued a notice, and I think it will definitely be better in the future.</p>
<p>After going back, I will sort out this work and make preparations for the next phase of work. I may enter Xinjiang this winter and plan to go west from Kuqa to Kashgar and Ruoqiang. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>— Song Xunlun</p>
<p>Expressing My Feelings</p>
<p>Not staying at Wenlang's Jade Mirror Terrace, how is it related to emotions resembling wind and thunder? The fairy dream on the Luo River has become a relic, and the tender feelings of spring orchids have turned to ashes. The jade tree and bright pearls are empty and lingering, and the falling flowers and flowing water wander alone. The cold plum's temperament resembles Vimalakirti's, only suitable for hiding this talent in West Lake.</p>
<p>Second Poem After thirty years, a child's heart is impossible to find, poetry enters a state of decline from splendor. Regretting joining the Gaha girl in understanding emotions, I wish to play the zither to Zhong Ziqi. Who under my eyes can be my phoenix mate? The sword in the box serves as a dragon's roar. The sound of autumn arises in Jiangcheng overnight, suppressing the mournful strings to play ancient sounds. (Recently studying music and frost songs with Ling Rumei's sons)</p>

<h3>One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yaoqun determined the location of the mark and immediately crossed the street, pretending to be casually looking at the street scene. She stood with her back against the wall, quickly and skillfully surveying the surroundings. With a swift movement of her hand behind her back, she used a pencil to draw the mark in the corresponding position on the photograph.</p>
<p>After making the mark, Yaoqun casually lingered around the hotel, checking to see if the mark was complete and correct. Just as she was loitering back to the entrance of the inn, she suddenly noticed five or six young men of different ages, ranging from about twenty to thirty years old, approaching from twenty or thirty yards to the south. Although these young men were walking separately, not connected to each other, the uniformity of their pace and speed made them stand out as a small group among the many pedestrians. From the same point of view, she saw three or four young men across the street also walking with a consistent pace.</p>
<p>In Yaoqun's eyes, the identification of this group of young men was even clearer than the identification of a uniformed army unit mixed in with ordinary people. She guessed that one of the young men might be a comrade from the Tianjin Detachment. She turned and stepped up the two stone steps at the entrance of the inn, facing outwards. In this way, she made her own position and target very prominent. Not only would a comrade not miss this target, but even unrelated passersby would be attracted by her conspicuous position and give her a curious, appreciative, or bored glance in their busy lives.</p>
<p>Yaoqun estimated the distance of the approaching men and quickly sent out the signal - an extremely ordinary action that no outsider, no matter how nervous, would suspect, but it was a signal for comrades to inquire about each other. Her bright, sparkling eyes swept over the scattered line of young men like lightning. She hoped to receive a response.</p>
<p>Sure enough, one of the young men walking at the head of the line, about thirty years old, wearing an ordinary suit, of medium height, fair-skinned, with a long, thin face, and the most distinctive mark was a pair of long, drooping eyebrows, like the "eyebrows reaching the temples" mentioned in common books, like the stage makeup, expressing a strong rebellious personality. He saw Yaoqun at a glance and recognized her signal. His eyes lit up suddenly, expressing surprise. He immediately raised his right hand casually and stroked his hair, replying to Yaoqun's signal. At the same time, his eyebrows suddenly twitched.</p>
<p>"Strange! ...It's so hard to find a car." Yaoqun muttered to herself quietly while the leader was still five or six steps away. This was the second step in exploring a comrade: "Hidden Words." (There were no fixed words for this type of hidden language, just ordinary words that were seen and felt. If there were companions speaking to each other, repeating the sentence would serve as the sign.)</p>
<p>According to regulations, if the person who came was a comrade, after hearing this hidden language, he should immediately reply with a "guessing game"-style sentence. The reply only needed to be slightly related to the meaning of the other party's utterance. But this comrade seemed to see some warning signs and did not open his mouth. He only glanced at the "China Hotel" sign, replacing his answer (Yaoqun's "hiring a car" indicates movement from this place to a certain place, or indicates the intention to go to a destination. The person looked at the hotel sign, indicating "address" is targeted with "hiring a car", or replying to Yaoqun not to go to her destination, seeming to say that he already knows the "location" and can come to "China Hotel"). After answering, he also snapped his thumb and middle finger together, making a "crack" sound, sending out a "particularly dangerous" warning.</p>
<p>Known for her resourcefulness, since she had received a reply to the hidden language and also received a special danger signal at the same time, she should quickly pay attention to the environment, temporarily suspend other steps in searching for comrades, carefully examine her own actions, and pay attention to where the danger was, in order to avoid it. But at this time, Yaoqun, for some unknown reason, seemed to have lost her mind. Perhaps she was too careless and did not value the other party's warning. She only smiled slightly and stepped off the steps, preparing to follow the leader and inquire again.</p>

<h3>The Pain of Mourning a Deceased Wife</h3>
<p>— Lean Oriole</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Pieces from the Violet Box</p>
<p>The pain of mourning a deceased wife is something only those who have experienced it can truly understand. Feng Qian's grief is not surprising. In particular, mourning a wife in middle or old age is the hardest to bear, because one has grown accustomed to living with a long-time partner. The blow of being separated by death is simply too great. On the 23rd day of the fourth month of the Bingxu year, my wife, Feng Jun, passed away from lung disease complicated by heart disease. We had depended on each other for thirty years, and suddenly we were separated forever. Even the "broken intestines" described by ancient Chinese poets, or the "heartbreak" described by Westerners, cannot compare to the pain I felt at that time. Later, I wrote a "Letter to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun," and also filled out more than thirty stanzas of short poems like "Luo Fu Mei" and "Zui Hua Yin," which finally allowed me to vent some of my grief. However, for the past year, the remaining sorrow has not faded, and various emotions arise. I thought about writing another ten-thousand-word letter to my deceased wife in the afterlife, to tell her about the various things that have happened this past year. I mentioned it to my friends, and they said: "Forget it, the dead are gone. Why do something so useless and cause yourself more grief?" I thought they were right, so I intended to put down my pen, and eventually I did. But usually, whenever I read the poems and lyrics of people in the past, I always paid attention to their works mourning the deceased, selecting those that were both emotionally and literarily moving, and copying them down one by one, as a way of using other people's wine glasses to pour out my own sorrows. Among them, like Li Fanxie's "Mourning My Deceased Concubine on the Lantern Festival," set to the tune of "Qing Ping Yue," it says: "Tears soak my spring clothes, who asks how shallow the spring cold is? Still the same as last year's Lantern Festival, the brocade zither's beautiful years are not yet full. Coming again to the winding path, the moss is desolate. A screen of plum shadows is desolate. Suspecting she's before and behind the small building, not knowing where she is hiding?" The last two sentences are fanciful and all the more poignant. Nalan Rongruo's "Xiao Shan Shi Mourning the Deceased" says: "Lately, there have been countless sad things, who can I talk to about the long nights? Just let them go, the green window, red tears, the early geese first cry... At that time, I understood, but now it's all lost, I've been unfaithful to my feelings. Suddenly I suspect you've arrived, the painted lantern flickers in the wind, foolishly counting the spring stars." "Nan Xiang Zi" inscribed on a photo of his deceased wife says: "Tears choke me, but no sound comes out. I only regret my indifference in the past. Depending on the portrait to try to recognize you again, delicate and beautiful. A piece of heartbrokenness cannot be painted. Separate words, the state is clear. At midnight, the mandarin ducks' dream wakes up early. You wake up early, I dream, again and again. Crying until the night rain bell on the wind eaves is exhausted." "Jin Lü Qu, Feeling on the Anniversary of My Deceased Wife's Death" says: "When will this hate end! Dripping in the empty courtyard, the cold rain has stopped, the weather for burying flowers. Three years have passed, my soul and dreams are distant, if it's a dream, it should have woken up long ago. I expect you also feel that the human world is tasteless. It can't compare to being separated by the dust of the night terrace, cold and desolate, a piece of land burying sorrow, hairpin agreement, completely abandoned. If there are paired fish to send in the underworld, let them know whether the years to come will be bitter or joyful, who will you rely on? I toss and turn all night, enduring to hear the Xiang zither re-tuned. Waiting to make an acquaintance in another life. I'm still afraid that both of us will have short lives. There will be little chance of meeting again in the wind and moon. Clear tears are exhausted, paper ashes rise." There are several other pieces, all found in the Tongzhitang Lyrics, which also show how painful he was at the time. Hong Beijiang also sighed deeply in his poems and lyrics because of the death of his wife, Jiang Shi, which were very sincere. Poems like "Seven-Character律 Poems Mourning the Deceased Wife," eight in total, contain lines like "Occasionally thinking of your words, I weep in my leisure, frequently summoning your living soul in secret, how can I bear the cold pillow and cold quilt at night, hearing again the cries of my children?" "Who pities the lonely shadow of the one who dies later, your last words have already arranged for another life," and other lines that are very sad and moving. Lyrics like "Lang Tao Sha" says: "Dreaming of entering the small red door. Dew wets the curtain. The shadow of the waning moon on the money box is faint. It's just that outside the tent of the lonely sleeper, butterflies fly in pairs. With even more suspicion. Afraid to step on the stairs. Vaguely recognizing you in the painted screen's Luanchu. On the seven-foot sandalwood table, who is performing spirit writing?" "The setting sun shines on the ghost gate pass. The crescent moon is curved. Can one see the Husband-Watching Mountain from the night terrace? Afraid that the thin soul cannot be supported, adding a red post. Pushing the pillow, the drip pot is about to run out. Vermilion tears are spotted. How can the cold night only be returned in dreams? If there is no place to bury hate underground, I will still come to the human world." Also says: "The road is far, the small building is low. Flowers scatter and fly. Still holding hatred, climbing the heavy stairs. Not only can't I find the old person, even the swallows on the beam are not the same. Opening the meeting door in sorrow. The waning moon is just setting in the west. The wind breaks the painted curtain, the dressing table is askew. Only the six-panel folding screen still covers the silk clothes." "Eight-Sound Ganzhou, Dreaming of the Deceased Wife" says: "Towards the end of the empty room, the tile lamp is dim, the crescent moon's shadow is horizontal. Calculating the pain of separation and the passing away, the end of winter is already like this, how much more after spring? Folding the half-bed of quilts and pillows, often brushing away the fine dust. The mirror is all well, to shine on the returning soul. After all, what am I hiding from you? Only when we meet on the night terrace, the intervals are still attentive. Sighing at King Xiang's lonely lodge, the flowing clouds have long been cut off. Thinking of the twelve railings east and west, even in dreams, I want to patrol around. Plum blossom verses, from now on, I will not write them, lest they contain a frown." The line "Can one see the Husband-Watching Mountain from the night terrace" in his "Lang Tao Sha" is roughly similar to the line "The nine springs should have a Husband-Watching Mountain" in my poem mourning my deceased wife, which shows that the foolish thoughts of those who mourn the deceased can coincide without prior consultation.</p>
