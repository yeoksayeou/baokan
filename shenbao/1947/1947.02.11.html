<p>〔中央社太原九日電〕據此問軍事當局談稱：延安連日廣播，謂一月二十九日共軍侵佔定襄縣境，三十日在靈石殲滅並俘虜國軍保安副團長以下五百餘（後又改稱九百九十餘人），文水俘國軍團長以上二千餘等語，純屬揑造。蓋定襄上月平靖無事，縣境始終在國軍手中，致所謂俘虞國軍若千云云，更屬荒謬。查靈石之役，國軍與進犯共軍作正面接觸者為一個連，文水城亦僅三個運，何來數百數千之國軍為其俘虜，實際亦即此大部戰士亦多突圍而出，歸返部隊矣。</p>

<h3>民社黨參加政府人選　本週常會可決定　左舜生否認已提出名單</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨參加政府之民單以及赴京代表團之人選，目前尙在交換意見之階段，本週常會中可望能有決定。據該黨某要員吿記者：張君勱氏因身爲參政員，故不能參加改級後之立法院及監察院。對於參加政府，黨內有兩種意見，一爲參加立法。監察兩院，從事行憲工作，而不參與行政機構，理由爲當前戰禍延長，經濟凋疲，民社黨如全面參加政府後，旣屬無補時艱，且勢將負連帶責任，張君勱氏即如此主張。另一派則主張不參加則已，要參加則須全面參加，獲得一部份權力，負起實際責任。目前政府之改組，事實上爲一種「擴大」依目前情勢推測，民社黨之參加立。監兩院，可能僅爲參加政府之第一步，三中全會後，民社黨內部可能有人認爲政府結束訓政有高度誠意，而要求作全面參加者。</p>

<h3>丁逆默判決理由原文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十日電〕丁逆默邨八日經苜都高院宣判死刑，因丁逆案情重大，高院方面對整理該案判決書頗爲愼重，茲將判決理由原文發表如下；</p>
<p>所任僞</p>
<p>本件被告丁默邨，對擔任為特工總部主任，為全國代表大會代表，僞中央執委會常委，僞中央黨部社會部長，僞行政院社會部長，偽中央政治委會委員，僞交通部長，僞社會福利部長，僞最高國防委會秘書長，僞政治保衛部副監，及僞浙江省長兼僞省黨部主委，僞駐杭綏靖主任，僞省保安司令等職，在偵察及審理中，迭經自認不諱，核與前軍委會調查統計局偵訊筆錄中被吿之陳述，及被吿自白書中所述相吻合，並有調案之僞行政院公報（第六十二號至第七十號內有被吿以偽部長職銜出席之各會議錄）可供參證，被吿參加僞組織之事實極爲明顯。</p>
<p>擊殺郁華</p>
<p>查京滬淪陷後，上海因租界關係，前江蘇高等法院第二分院尚能行使其職權，僞特工總部因該院職員忠心黨國，執法如山，不願參加和運，並有碍其工作，遂於民國廿八年十一月廿三日上午八時許，密派行動人員，預伏於法租界善鍾路二〇二號該院刑庭庭長郁華住宅門前，乘其赴院辦公，將其擊殺，以示警戒，不僅被害人之妻郁陳蔭到案指體如繪，並有該院密呈司法行政部。同年十一月廿九日第五三四九號曁陷第五三五〇號代電（見前上海江蘇高等法院第二分防行政文卷），及同年二月卅一日中美日報（見郁陳蔭貼報木第十一頁），及廿九年三月二十日珠江日報（見上開貼報本第十九頁），同年三月廿四日，香港星島日報（見上開貼報本第十八頁）之記載，可資作證。</p>
<p>鄭蘋如案</p>
<p>又鄭頻如係前上海江蘇高等法院第二分院首席檢察官鄭鉞之女，於民國廿六年參加中國國民黨中中央執委會調查統計室工作，民廿八年春，該室密派潛入為特工總部，並飭乘機制裁諸逆，鄭蘋如利用與丁逆默邨師生關係，佯與親近，爰於同年二月廿一日午後五時，亦以購買大衣爲名，將丁默邨誘至靜安寺路戈登路口西比利亞皮貨店，由預伏該處之行動人員開槍射擊，因被吿機警，所謀未遂，鄭蘋如因事敗露，於同月廿六日被僞特工總部逮捕，不久即被處死，此種加害經過，業經被害人之弟鄭華君及證人潘三省到案供證明確，（見上海高院三十五年十二月十一日囑託訊問筆錄），核與中國國民黨中央執委會調查統計局民三十五年十二月九日勝「三五九」指字第五一六七號公函內容所載符合，至可認爲眞實，</p>
<p>殺害志士</p>
<p>又前軍委會調查統計局上海區之地下工作人員情報第一組組員許克，於民廿八年五月廿四日，在滬被槍殺情報第五組組長李楚琛，在滬制裁丁默邨李士羣未成被捕，於同年二月二十五日被害；情報第五組組員陳兆慶，制裁李士羣失敗被捕，於同年二月二十五日被害；電訊督察徐壽新，因與中央通報，於同年三月二十七日被害；行動第五隊長余延智，暗藏軍火，於同年十二月二十七日被害；通訊員周希良，因竊重要文件，於同年十二月二十七日被槍決；直屬通訊員徐阿梅，於同年十二月間亦遭受槍決；彭福戎因在滬執行行動案件被捕，於同年四月十三日被害。以上八員，均係被僞特工總部逮捕殺害，有前國府軍委會調查統計局民三十五年十月二十二日京偵護字第四七三一號代電證明確實，所開以上被難中央工作人員，均係在被告在為特工叫部主任時期內慘遭殺害，筱吿當負全責。</p>
<p>通敵言行</p>
<p>再查僞中央政治，委員有爲僞組織之最高機構，凡有關政治，經濟，外交及軍事等僞國策，無不取決於該會，被吿於該會成立之始，即由汪逆兆銘指定爲委員，直至勝利爲止，被吿在該會任職多年，旣爲被吿所自認，對該會一切之決議，自應共同負責。雖被吿對該會各種重要議案，如中日基本條約，中日滿同盟條約，對英美宣戰等等，或　「記不得」，或稱「未參與」，或稱「曾加反對」，顯係狡賴之詞，殊難容其空言諉卸，復查被吿於僞社會福利部長任內，曾發表「歲首感言」一文（見民卅三年二月僞中央日報社出版卅三年新歲特輯第卅五頁），主張「惟有大東亞戰爭勝利，東亞民族才得解放」。誇張日寇戰力，鼓吹整軍建軍，加緊訓練靑年，企圖與敵寇並肩作戰，擊滅英美，以使實現大東亞主義，其通敵謀叛，溢於言表，無可掩飾。（未完待續）</p>
<h3>社論　金潮中的政治因素</h3>
<p>金鈔在漲風潮，自過了廢曆新年以來，突趨瘋狂；到了昨天黃金已叩七百萬大關，美鈔黑市亦已上漲至一萬三千元，且復有價無市，形勢至爲混亂，人心亦均惶惶；蓋以金價上漲，必然牽連到一般物價的上漲，使工商趨於萎縮，人民生計益困。對於此一風潮之掀起，本報曾著論闡述所見，認爲人民應有健全心理，政府應闡明並執行堅定政策。其時金價尙盤旋於四百八十萬左右，事隔五天，金價竟狂漲到叩七百萬的大關，距二月一日的三九六·五，僅短短的幾天工夫，而金價上漲已達百分之七十六左右；漲風之狂，可以想見。此次金價漲風之所以如此狂漲，投機作祟，固然是一個重要因素，但其中也有値得我們注意的若干點。</p>
<p>首先我們所要指出的就是上海的金價，本來低於平津華北各地。二月一日當上海的金價還擊旋於三九六·五之際，天津的金價已在五四〇。七，北平在五二·五，西安在五〇〇·五，就中以太原的金價爲最昂。商人從上海搬運黄金到華北可以獲巨利；而華北金價之所以比較京滬爲昂，除了地理的因素以外，不免還有其它的原因。「抗幣」在「解放區」調換了物資以後，於是復以物資換取法幣，換取黄金，於是使華北的金價抬高，商人以有利可圖，於是競運黄金北去。最近由天津海關查獲的一批黄金，就是黄金北運的一個顯著例子。所以此次上海金價的狂漲，似乎不單純是一個經濟問題，這裹而還存着很大的政治作用。</p>
<p>惟恐中國不亂，使中國經濟趨於崩潰全民不安，原是共產黨一貫的策略；此在以調人自處的馬歇爾元帥，亦曾言之，促使中國經濟崩潰的一條捷徑，便在使物價提高，迫使得工商業無法維持，人民無法生活。欲達到此目的，鼓動黄金風潮是一個最快捷的手段。所以從使中國趨於經濟崩潰爲共產黨一貫策略方面看，此次的金潮，不免又有共產黨在起作用。一般投機商人顧了目前利益，或不曾想到金市塲的掀風作浪，如果造成了經濟恐慌，促成了經濟崩潰，則正墮了共黨的術中，論其終極，倘使經濟果眞崩潰，共黨的策略完成，對於他們本身亦不是一件有利的事。</p>
<p>所以我們要於此籲請一般從事淤黃金買賣的人要以民族利益爲重，不要祗顧到目前一時的利益。中國的經濟如再惡化而不可收拾，現在所贏得的利益勢必不保，此其結果，諒非他們所樂見。我們願再申我們的前論，我們必須建立我們健全的心理，重建我們對於自己及我們民族的自信。爲了我們民族的前途，同時，也是爲了我們各自的前途，我們不能讓我們的經濟形勢再惡化下去：我們要竭其全力來挽救各種頹勢。</p>
<p>但我們於此又不得不指出政府對此次金潮所負的責任。此次金潮之所由發生的一個近因，無疑地，由於大額紙幣的發行，金價的狂漲正値大額紙幣發行之後，其間的因果關係，自至明顯·大額紙幣的發行，表示政府本身對於自身所發行的紙幣似已失去其自信；遂致促成一般價格的上騰。論到它的遠因，應該上溯到黄金儲蓄按六折實發的往事。政府創辦黄金儲蓄？原期法幣回籠；人民信賴政府，於是出其儲蓄購買黃金，且在當時，政府又從而多方鼓勵。孰料人民以其辛勤所得之儲蓄交予政府；而政府於發給黄金之時，突然下令打了一個六折。這表示政府自身的不重諾言；反而像是一種欺騙手段來詐取人民的儲蓄。坐是人民對於政府漸失信任，不敢再以儲蓄所得交予政府，於是競購黄金美鈔，致造成今日的局勢。我們經濟則政局勢之到今日的境地，政府本身實在應該負大部的責任。不是人民自動地對政府失信，而是由於政府的種種舉措迫使人民放棄對政府的信任。所以在此次金潮，人民固應重建自信，最要緊的還是在政府如何取信於人民。政府必首先建立自信，然後人民對於政府的信任纔能重建起來。政府應該趕快拿出辦法來。</p>
<p>要之，目今中國經濟界的種種現象，總逃不了穹勿的政治因素。目前中國經濟的頹勢，主要由於共產黨的作崇。因為有共產黨的武力乃至經濟鬥爭的存在，所以勝利後的一年多時間，政府對於我國經濟局勢的改善不能為澈底的措施。同時，政府所有的措施，又未必能收它們預期的目的。當茲經濟惡化之會，我們要籲請政府採取斷然的措施，來迅速防制局勢的再惡化。</p>

<h3>沙市囚徒暴動越獄　脫逃要犯百十二名</h3>
<p>大部為漢奸及判處列刑無期徒刑者</p>
<p>〔本報漢口訊〕關於沙市地方法院看守所要犯百餘人大越獄案，記者頃晤沙市來人，談及當時越獄詳情，頗多突元之處，究竟此案係犯人有計劃行動，抑係由看守人員縱放，各方甚爲注意，茲略記內容如下：緣該院看守所設於沙市三民街，所長李某於月前赴漢未返，在此期中，該所主要負責人僅一所官及戒護主任，所中戒備，是否即因此而有疎怠，頗滋疑問。同時據該所看守兵對人宣稱：</p>
<p>此案未發生前，該所禮字第一第二兩號內囚犯，常以</p>
<p>日語通話</p>
<p>守兵不謂日語，故未察覺有他。迨至元月二十九日晚十一時三十五分，該所職員俱已就寢，僅有看守兵三名輪値夜班，內有二名戒護第三監獄，另一名則特槍守於大門之內，擔任看守勤務，正巡梭間，忽有禮字二號監內漢奸犯王述耀，</p>
<p>聲言口渴</p>
<p>要求値夜看守兵萬國華給予冷水一碗，萬即允諾，以冷水由木栅遞進，壬犯接水後，突將萬手猛力拖住，並呼另一囚犯扼住萬之咽喉，使其不能動彈，而盜匪犯聶鵬等亦立即響應，一時數十囚犯，協同拆毀木柱，相繼</p>
<p>蜂湧而出</p>
<p>先將守兵萬某綑綁，再由王述耀聶鵬二犯率領，將正在打瞌睡之守兵二名一併綑縛，奪取該兵等長槍二支，並强迫交出鑰匙，於打開禮字三號監後，復齊向前面職員宿舍撞去，逼迫戒護主任打開獄門，刦奪衛兵長槍一支，並將所中職員，一一綑綁，丢進禮字第二號木　內，用棉被掩蓋，致無人敢於聲張。一面又强迫四五兩號囚犯合流，幷派人至前後門守衛，不許啓鎖，以待其解除鐐銬，歷時的一小時以上，該犯等始解脫刑具，飛備集體脫逃，臨行時，犯人方超等且</p>
<p>主張殺死</p>
<p>戒護主任及該所所官，嗣爲他犯所阻未果，直至次晨一時四十分，乃從容開放大門，由靑運閣經塔兒橋，向草市方面逸去，而此一羣巨奸大愁，遂得以暴力脫離法網。據事後調查，總計該所此次越獄囚犯，共一一二名，其中以犯漢奸罪者最多，的佔總數百分之八十以上，經處死刑曁無期徒刑者，亦近三十人，可謂空前一大越獄案。又據談稱：「該所在押之犯人共爲一七五人，此次尙未隨同越獄者有六十三人，皆係罪刑甚輕，故不願合淡」云</p>

<p>在德蘇戰事初期，紅軍在數量上所佔的優勢有一部份爲技術上的困難所抵消，大半依靠在歷史上久著威名的砲隊，來阻遏德軍的進展，使蘇軍有機會來訓練和裝備足够的坦克車隊。</p>
<p>在戰時，雖然有許多最重要的工業區域爲敵軍佔領，蘇聯仍能提供相當的配備，來配合她大事擴充的軍隊。這種配備大部份依仗美國的租借物資。</p>
<p>紅軍的訓練計劃基於一種假想，以爲將來的戰爭當是一種馬托和機器的戰爭，需要大量曾受各種軍事技術訓練的人員。史達林元帥曾指陳，凡是受過訓練的人員（就是熟習各種專門技術的人），在各方面都是決定的因素。依照這種指示，紅軍曾設立各種學校，敎授各種軍事學議。</p>
<p>特種政治敎官，常常跟着士兵們深入戰綫，爲士兵們解釋最近的重要事時新聞，傳達情報局的每日公報，使士兵們都熟悉國內外的局勢。紅軍還辦有各種研究會，敎授各種行業，設立許多種科目。</p>
<p>蘇聯公共衛生次長普遼洛夫博士宣稱，二次大戰中紅軍在軍醫方面的成續超過任何參戰國家——在紅軍後方醫院中的死亡率祗有百分之一·一，傷兵治愈後重回戰塲的達百分之七十三。</p>
<p>普遼洛夫博士根據何種材料來作這個比較的，我們不知道。美國軍部正在編製二次大戰中前後方軍醫院裹的死亡紀錄。美國陸軍傷兵中有百分之七十三仍舊回到戰塲上去服役。</p>
<p>最近幾年內，蘇聯軍中已經有一　特殊階級出現。紅軍正在沿着一條新的路綫發展，和舊俄以及別的資本主義國家的軍隊十分相似。兵士和軍官的界限一天比一天分得淸楚。跟着赤衛軍的得勢，崛起了一種貴族化的軍人階級，他們享受着特殊的權利，支領着超過別種部隊的薪餉。</p>
<p>共產黨現在操縱着最高軍事機關。黨和軍的領導權混在一起，幾乎分不淸楚，然而在一切之上，站在最高地位的是史達林，各種領導權都　集在他一個人身上。</p>

<h3>愛迭生百年年誕辰　十六年前似曾以鈾作試騐</h3>
<p>〔合衆社新澤稷州西奧林奇八日電〕此間頃發現：大發明家愛迭生在十六年以前似曾以鈾作試騐，緣其書桌內發現一貯有硝酸鈾之試騐管。惟愛氏試騐此放射性物質，其目的何在，則尙不可知，或可由其書桌內所藏之大量紙片獲得綫索。星期二（十一日）爲愛迭生百年誕辰。美海軍透露：第一次大戰時，美海軍曾使用愛氏之發明物三十九種，其中飛機測向器一種，英軍曾於第二次世界大戰時使用於對德戰爭中。</p>
<h3>英政府斷電計劃　伯明罕不予服從</h3>
<p>下院即獎展開激烈辯論</p>
<p>〔路透社會倫敦十日電〕在政府斷電計劃定期開始前之數小時，工業大城伯明罕認為政府之計劃不能實行，已決定不予服從，然全城之卅一萬家庭用戶，則將各憑信用，自動於規定斷電時間，即每日上午九時至十二時，下午二時至四時，停止用電，良以工業用電與家庭用電來源相同，工業用電旣決定照常供應，家庭用電自無法單獨切斷也。倫敦若干區因有不在斷電之列之主要工業，故亦決定由家庭用戶自動停止使用電流。與煤斤及電力有關之各內閣閣員，今日繼續討論此事並硏究各方面之批評，燃料及電力部之各部職員，並忙於簽覆國各處之抗議書及質詢，辛威本人自早至晚未離其辦公室。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕倫敦巴特西發電廠已於今日起由管制電力供應之四人撥動機件，將每一小站之電力供應量逐漸减少，半小時內，每小時供應量達廿五萬瓩之電力，即被减至十萬瓩，估計每小時可節省之煤斤，可達十三萬五千磅。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十日電〕艾德禮首想定今日向下院發明聲明，閘述於今日午夜起開始實行之斷電措施，邱吉爾屆時當親自到會，其先保守黨幹部及其燃料委員會將召開特別會議，預料辯論將在一二天內展開。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕蘇格闌塲警局於星期六接獲自倫敦南端打至該局之電話，謂燃料及電力大臣辛威爾之住宅，今晨將有定時炸彈爆炸，警察於搜查並戒備後，並無事件發生。</p>
<h3>越盟約態度</h3>
<p>胡志明總統聲明：法國若不能以和平方法解決目前的爭執，維明政府即將聲請聯合國機構仲裁……</p>
<p>〔路透社新加坡九日電〕由於西貢法當局採取「新聞檢查制的鐵幕」，故本社駐越南記者廿培爾，不得不派專差携維明共和國總統胡志明之重要聲明送至本社新加坡社發表。胡志明係自越南某地（其所在非法方所知）函甘培爾，聲明法國若不能以和平方法解決目前之爭執，維明政府即將聲請聯合國機構仲裁。</p>
<p>法當局對一切發往國外之電報，均施軍事檢查制，此雖尙屬合理，然以撿查過於嚴格，故無一記者，即使於付淸發電費後，能知其所發電報之命運。撿查當局如有删减或禁發等情，亦從不通知發電人，此種情形，實爲世界檢查制所未有。（按本社總社已於今夜根據甘培爾之報吿，就越南之新開檢查制，向法政府提出嚴重抗議）以下乃甘爾派專差送至新加坡之電報：</p>
<p>西貢電：（遲到）維明政府總理兼外長胡志明自河內附近某處致函記者，答覆記者向其所提之若干問題。胡氏聲明若法國不能以和平方法解決目前爭執，維明準備聲請聯合國機構仲裁，其他問答如下：</p>
<p>問：維明政府準備在何種條件下停止戰爭，恢復與法政府談判？</p>
<p>答：維明人民所願者惟國家統一（所括操安南語之交趾支那，安南東京三省）及獨立，並無其他要求，此一目的達到後，即準備立即停戰議和。</p>
<p>問：若法方不能接受此等條件，擬採何種行動？</p>
<p>答：若法方不能以和平方法解決科紛，維明政府將向聯合國機構聲請仲裁—或許四强最宜於擔任此一任務。</p>
<p>問：目前之戰爭對於越南經濟影響如何？</p>
<p>答：全國經濟已受戰爭嚴重影響，生產銳减至十分之一，煤斤產量减至五分之一，米糧產量减至四分之一，其他被法方轟炸而死亡之平民，破壊之城鎭，更無從估計其損失。</p>
<p>問：維明當局對法國人民有適當之照顧吾？</p>
<p>答：然此等法人之待遇遠較法當局治下維明人民所受之待遇爲佳，法人來函向我方道謝者殊不少。</p>
<p>胡志明繼謂：余願將下列事實上諸被法方宣傳所欺矇之各位記者前，法方稱維明爲日本人之工具，完全出諸揑造，曾在雲南昆明之美國人，可以作證，蓋此等美國友人，遲至一九四五年八月底，尙爲我抗日遊擊隊之賓客故也，彼等當能以眞相吿知各位記者。　法方又稱維明爲共產黨，查維明之全名乃爲維明獨立同盟。係由各不同之政黨，包括社會黨，民主黨，國民黨，馬克斯黨。及無黨派組織如天主教，佛敎，儒敎及地主等合組而成，其百分之九十之會員，完全爲本於愛國熱忱而參加獨立奮門，在維明政府內亦有各然派及無黨派人士參加，例如七十高齡之內政部長黄陶康，即爲曾被法國人放逐於波洛孔達達十四年之久之無黨派人士，吾人之政策決非共產甚至無社會主義之色彩。</p>
<p>胡志明繼謂：法方又稱此次戰爭係維明預　　動，欲明事實眞想，必須回述云年三月六日以來法方之政策，如法維協定之未付實行，交趾支那之大規模恐佈活動，安南南部巴寗之被佔，海防港之被封鎖，諒山之被圍，法軍之增加不已，法士兵之日有挑業行爲，及去年十二月十七日河內法軍之屠殺及搶劫等，本人曾向法政府呼籲迄未獲有答覆，最近隨法殖民部長慕台來越視察之杜培恩氏，近在巴黎「直言報」爲文，其中雖有若干錯誤，然越南事件之眞正原因不難自其中窺見之。吾人深知法人武器優於我方，且不論戰爭結果如何，我國人民之生活不免受其糜爛，然則吾人何能首先發動戰爭？總之吾人之要求，僅統一獨立與和平而已。</p>

<h3>日政局再陷混亂　進步黨積極謀組新黨　吉田仍謀組聨合內閣</h3>
<p>〔改造社東京十日電〕日本政局自吉田內閣安然渡過二月一日的大罷工難關後，未到十天，又陷入極端混亂局面，不滿吉田改組內閣之</p>
<p>進步黨　一週來提倡組織聯合內閣後，最近忽提出組織新黨口號。該黨今晨舉行最高幹部會議，決定以下各項：（一）組織聯合政權工作，因自由黨內部意見分歧，難望迅速具體化，故此際應組織新黨，以突破目前危局；（二）組織新黨，並非以打倒吉田內閣為目的，其第一目的是重建日本；（三）參加新黨各派，連進步黨在內，須各自解散，以謀團結一致；（四）進步黨與自由黨內贊成新黨人士，密切提携，而向各黨派呼籲，迅速組成新黨；（五）呼續範圍，只限於協同民主黨，國民黨與無黨派俱樂部；共產黨及社會黨不在其內，尤其是對後者，因爲恐給人以分化社會黨的印象。下午，進步黨又召開緊急幹部會，決定了以下三原則：（一）排斥以維持現養為原則之一切政治行動；（二）促使一大革新政黨之實現，新聯合內閣必須樹立在此一精神的基礎上；（三）新黨成立機會一日成熟，進步黨立即解散。</p>
<p>自由黨　今日向進步黨建議由自由進步黨總裁，河合厚想（進步黨）石橋藏想（自由黨）及兩黨幹事長共商時局問題，但遭進步黨拒絕，因自由黨目前之政治行動，乃以維持現狀爲前提。目下各小黨派對團結保守陣營「革新」政黨一事，相當感興趣，因此參加成分較多。</p>
<p>社會黨　對進步黨的新黨工作，暫抱靜觀態度，認爲新黨工作乃「聯合」工作變相發展之結果，新黨決非社會主義之政黨。現在自由黨中贊成新黨運動者，乃是以蘆田均爲中心之一派，渠仍在與進步黨暗中聯絡，以便脫離自由黨。當進步黨大嚷新黨運動之時，吉田首相又開始其第三决聯合內閣工作，今天下午召集幣原國務相，石橋藏相，河合厚生相，內閣書記官長林讓治，自由黨幹事長大野，總務大久保，北聆吉等，再度協議聯合工作，石橋，河合兩人根據兩日來暗中與社會黨某方面交涉之結果，提出新方案，其內容與上兩次之條件相差不多，即（一）石橋留任；（二）讓三個在野黨入閣；（三）閣席的分配方法是自由黨六，進步黨五，社會黨五。但此次會議，進步黨幹事長田中並未出席。且進步黨主張組織新黨，十分彈硬，故對此一方案，不一定贊成。此際問題在吉田，幣原雨人對新黨運動之態度，究竟如何，進非黨方面，內內心預料吉田，幣原最後亦得參加新黨。總之，自由，進步，兩黨爲「聯合」問題，感情大不如前，在十四日復會之議會中，能否保持友黨態度，頗或疑問</p>

<h3>美農業部發表　世界產米狀況</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓九日電〕美農業部今日發表每月報吿，預料在一九四六—四七年內世界米糧產量，可望恢復至約等於戰前之產量。中國，印度，日太爲世界最大之米糧消費國，在本年內預料產量可以增加，使其糧况得以改善。惟以緬暹越等米糧出國之國內局勢，尙未復正常，故世界米糧出口供應，尙不致較去年有大量之增加，據最近情報稱，一九四六—四七年之總產量，可望達七十一億，布許爾，較去年增百分之十一，較戰前每年七百四十萬，布許爾之平均產量，僅低百分之四·中國之收穫本年可望達廿三億一千萬布許爾，較去年的增二億布許爾。三大轍出國中，緬甸本年僅有的十億可供輸出，暹羅越南可供輸出之量甚微。</p>

<h3>勸工大樓鬥毆事件　市長發表談話　陰謀份子亂秩序　於法於理咎無可辭　用意端在擴大反美宣傳　罪惡重大政府必須嚴辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕為勸工大樓集會發生鬥毆事件，吳市長特於昨午五時，在市府會議室接見各報記者，報告其處理經過。略稱：今午十二時十分，有本市棉紡業等各同業公會十九單位，計代表十九人，赳市府求見本人，分別叙述當時經過悄形，並望求主持公道，飭查禍首，並嚴辦兇手。本人當時即表示願意接受，彼等並出示當日大會之傳單及散發之歌曲等證明文件，內有「趕不走那美軍心不甘」，「美國貨害人精」，及「製造內戰的混蛋」等，其通知書上則為：「逕啟者，茲為推行國貨挽救工商業之危機起見，特定本月九日上午九時假廣西路天津路口新都劇塲，（即新新公司六樓，電梯直上）招待全體廠商，討論進行方針，屆時務請光臨指敎，此致××同業公會。愛用國貨抵制美貨籌備委員會」</p>
<p>利用名議欺騙大眾</p>
<p>本人閱後，感到數點疑惑：（一）該會旣無組織，又無負資人，亦未公開徽求會員，利用愛用國貨名義，而進行反美工作，實堪研究。（二）現今為民主時代，凡談民主者原為合理，而該會應屬例外。凡民主之集會，理應由大衆公開推舉主席，且開會討論者，必須與發出之通知相符。現會議名稱及內客旣不相同，則可推想其必屬有人操縱，盜用名義，以引誘各同業公會，凡不幸受騙而參加者，則即謂擁護其主張，且可增加羣衆；凡不參加者，則即謂早經默認，此係有計劃之陰謀，用意在擴大反美宣傳，其罪惡實為重大，政府必須嚴辦。</p>
<p>飭查清楚依法嚴辦</p>
<p>最穢吳市長發表結論三點：（一）此番事件中，無辜死傷之市民，皆係會議主持者之罪惡，因若無此「掛羊頭賣狗肉」會議之召開，即不致發生此流血事件。對此事件政府有權澈查，不但在法律上，道義上，此輩陰謀份子均無法辭其咎。（二）對於此番事件，各報均應拿出正義感來，務使民衆辨明何者係眞民主，何渚係假民主，伺者屬眞自由，何者屬假自由。如今在英美民主國家中，凡人民有公開集會者，事先亦須報告所在地政府，蘇聯人民有公開集會，亦須由政府核准。對於不法之集會，深望市民儘量檢舉之。（三）勸工大樓之集會，事先並未告知社會局與警察局，於情於理，皆為不合法，顯然係有人搗亂，企圖　擾本市社會秩序，本人希望此　搗亂份子拿出良心來，饒饒上海市民！此番事件，本人已令社會局警察局迅連飭查清楚、依法嚴辦，將陰謀份子之搗亂價相公諸社會，使受肚會之制裁。</p>

<p>又市黨部於聞悉勸工大樓不幸事件後，昨晨由謝書記長仁釗，陳處長保泰，親至醫院慰問傷者，並至死者梁仁達家慰問。頃據談稱：此次事件，市黨部於事後方始開悉，方主委晋京未返，此事將提本週執委會討論，希望當局瀲查責任，嚴懲禍首，對於被難員工深為痛悼，當向社會呼籲救濟妥籌善後。</p>

<h3>筆路藍縷艱苦卓絕　兩孤兒院敎養兼施　黑暗中放出了聖潔的光芒　予不幸的孩童以溫情安慰</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕幾年以前，正當戰爭激烈進行，人民流離失所的時候，有兩位眞正的基督敎徒受了聖經偉大的啟示。聖經中說：「上帝在聖所中做孤兒的父」，又說「眷顧貧窮約有福了，……你擺設筵席，倒要請那貧窮的，殘廢的，瘸腿的，瞎眼的，你就有福了，因為他們沒有什麼可以報答你。」道兩位虔誠的基督敎徒，他們眼看到那時候有多多少天眞無辜的孩予在戰爭中變成了無父無母的孤兒，流落街頭，失去了人間的愛，失去了人間的溫暖。他們惻然心動，認為這是應該執行上帝意志的時候了。他們要給這些孤兒以幸福，給這些孤兄以安慰。雖然他們的力量有限，救不了天下所有的孤兒，但是一個，兩個，八個，十個……們視力所及，從街頭收領回家，給以愛撫，授以敎育，一天，兩大，一月，一年……筆路藍縷，堅苦卓絕，這偉大的工作，一直繼續了幾年。到現在「伯大尼孤兒院」與「以馬內利」孤兄院己蔚為大觀，近四百個孤兄孤女在那裏遊息，歌唱，生活任愛的樂園之。</p>
<p>伯大尼孤兒院博得廣大同情</p>
<p>「伯大尼孤兒院」的創辦人錢團運收師原在仁濟醫院隔壁的天安堂中傳敎。一九四〇年十二月八日太平洋戰爭爆發以後，日本人的魘爪伸入租界，連敎會也不能避免受它的統制，錢牧師因此退出了天安堂，說在這時他記起「上帝在聖所中做孤兒的父」的理言，就開始做收容孤兒的工作。他自己並沒有很多的錢，但是他不願意向外界募捐，僅僅　賣字所得來維持，與孩子們同甘共苦。漸漸的為外界知曉了，社會上原不乏有良心的人士，他所得的同情與援助一天天增加。</p>
<p>預見備開辦農塲領導鄕村工作</p>
<p>他在以前的台斯德朗路借了一所房子作為院址，往往有不知道是誰送的東西從牆上丟進來，有不知道是誰送的鈔票從信筒裏題進來，更有不相識的人親自送錢送金條來。就這樣他所收容的孤兒一天天增加，又有兩位熱心的敎友賣去了自己的房產帮助他買進座落在閘北交通路以前正風文學院的院址，達到孤兒院現有的規模。</p>
<p>錢牧師說：一我不承認這祗是一種慈善救濟工作，我想這是一個理想的試騐，集學校與家庭於一處的實騐，我要給他們受到高中敎育，還預備開農科辦農塲，讓他們滿二十歲後出去領導鄉村的農產工作。」他所敎養下的二百個孤兒都過着有規律的生活，活潑，健康，非常有禮貌。</p>
<p>以馬內利院內充滿慈愛氣氛</p>
<p>「以馬內和孤兒院」在愚園路上的漁光邨以內，小小的兩幢洋房更令人有家庭的溫暖親切之感。一幢內全是女孩子，一色的藍布旗袍，一式的頭上擊着一朶紅花，整齊極了，也美麗極了。另一幢是男院，小孩子們也一律穿着藍布長衫，他們看到參觀的人來到，齊聲唱了一首讚美詩，歌聲那樣隙區淸脆，洋溢着世間眞正的善與美的情緒，眞是天使般的音樂。</p>
<p>「以馬內利院」是中華神學院的畢業生胡蘊琳小姐所創辦，是在抗戰初起的時候，她從一所難民所看到了一個父母雙亡的孤女，深深地同情愛憐，想到聖經中「眷顯貧窮約有福了」，她就從收容這個孤女開始，一步步擴展工作，到現在以馬內利院內也有近二百個孤兒孤女，受着寇備而慈愛的敎育。</p>
<p>這兩所孤兒院默默無聞的存在於這黑暗混濁的大都市的郊區，似乎是兩朶污泥中的荷花，發出聖潔的光芒，它告訴我們：人間總究還有愛！</p>

<h3>市塲情況混亂已極　金價狂漲百萬元有零　美鈔港票一路扳高　錢兌交易已受監視</h3>
<p>燴赤昨在崩漬之情形下，混亂已極，十時半後，已無法展開正常交易，晨開五五〇萬至五五五萬，開後即現　忽，曾降落至五四三萬左右，即起買風，回升至五七〇萬，紗花帮中有所脫手，再向跌至五五五萬，此後即扶搖直上，十時後，央行以五六二萬之價，配給銀樓業一一八條，與登記數相差甚多，人心更爲恐慌，羣起爭買，立即穿越六〇〇萬大關，經過一度盤旋後，即吿有買無賣，正常之交易，無法展開，銀樓亦吿停市，午刻竟喊至六六〇萬，始吿回落，午後隔日交割，初開尙平，聞有大員蒞滬，乃在六六〇萬左右徘徊，惟人心仍俏，復哄高至七一五萬新高價，始有多方出籠而回小至六四〇萬以下，結果較上週六竟暴漲一百萬有零。飾金有限價關係，仍掛五十八萬，有行無市。銀元亦昂，暗息銀根仍鬆，息價不過一角半左右。</p>
<p>外幣亦混亂異常，美鈔暗市晨開一一〇〇〇元至一一三〇國〇元，此後即一再拉高，缺乏成交，午刻迫一三五〇〇元，午後再見二三八〇〇元高價而後轉盤，結果較上週六再漲二千元，港票自二千二起，一路扳高至二千八，而後稍回，結果較上週六漲起四五〇元，港匯自二二〇〇元起，盤高至二三〇砍刀左右，印匯二八三〇元，英匯三七二〇〇元左右，仍僅港匯有成交，錢兌交易已受當局監視。</p>
<h3>金號抬價投機　央行春令停配</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日金市一再猛漲，南京當局，認爲本市金業公會若干會員金號，向中央銀行申請領配黄金，有失原意，且有抬價投機之嫌，故昨特訓令中央銀行，暫行停配。惟對銀樓業方面，仍照舊配售，以應門市實銷。各銀樓門售價格，仍規定每兩不得超過中央銀行配售價二萬元。昨日中央銀行配售各銀樓價格爲每兩五十六萬二千元，故昨日各銀樓掛牌價，每兩爲五十八萬元。惟爲普遍應付門市顧客計，兌出飾物重兩，已有限制云。</p>
<h3>公債增多　市價節節進展</h3>
<p>公債昨亦趨活躍，統丙晨開二八〇〇百是元，由五四〇室五五二室進至三六八〇元高價，六〇四室等均售，而回降至三一五〇元，最後尙穩，收後復喊三三〇〇元有求，較上週六計漲起四百元，甲乙各升四五〇元，丁升三五〇元，戊升五五〇元，成交的一千萬元左右。</p>
<h3>紡建循例售紗　但以廠商爲限</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，惟悉數配售廠商，紗號未能分得杯羹。昨日共售紗一〇七四件，配售戶數共一〇一五戶。聞申請共達三四千件云</p>
<h3>棉布價格審議會　第三次臨時會議</h3>
<p>紡建提議隨時掛牌　決議呈請市府核示</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕棉布價格審議委員會於昨日下午三時假社會局召開第三次臨時會議，出席社會局經濟行政處長顧炳元，機器染織業公會代表潘士浩，棉布商業同業公會代表　久峰，市參議會代表劉靖基，中國紡織建設公司代表吳叔方等，席間紡建公司代表提議，審議棉布價格原以棉紗，（原料），製迆，事務及其他等四項費用爲基準。今因本市物價波動劇烈，紗價亦不能例外，故定期性之棉布議價，收效甚微。復查紗價旣由本公司隨時掛牌，則棉在市價，似可由木公司統盤籌劃，作適當處置，以收穩定之效。經決議呈請市政府核示。</p>

<h3>社局拋售暹米六萬餘包　米糧黑市依然猖獗　雜糧粉油均見新高價</h3>
<p>昨日米糧雜糧兩市塲，在買氣籠罩下，漲勢愈演愈烈，加以金鈔再度猛騰，人心浮動，銷路旺盛，兼之一部份投機份子，推波助瀾，暗中哄抬，各貨莫不競見新價，形勢至爲惡劣，茲分述如后：</p>
<p>食米</p>
<p>來源幾於吿絕，兩市僅到糯米二百八十三石，雖有社局繼續大量拋售二號西貢米六萬七千七百包，仍難抑平黑市，陰變元猛升二萬元上下，塲外因米店急於添購，貨主視粳秈爲寄貨，仰天討價，頓呈有市無貨之狀，非正式行情各貨飛跳二萬元有奇，常熟粳竟達十一萬五千元，薄稻及洋秈亦達十一萬元，早稻則叩十萬大關，漲勢之速與巨，實出乎意料之外</p>
<p>麪粉</p>
<p>早開僅有篩統二號粉一百包，價三萬九千元，較前市猛升三四千元，又有恩特洋粉（百磅）二百元，價八萬七千元，其後，即依然呈求過於供情勢，喊價逐步挺升，無貨應市，直至午收止，猶無做開，最後開有某洋行開售加拿大洋粉（百五十磅），價尙在討論中，的爲十二萬元。麩皮竄勢允烈，棧單貨踢皮球，大包開盤即爲三萬二千元，後直升至五千元，小包由二萬元直升至二千元，大的在升一成半之巨。小麥未聞交易。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>因原料昂貴，產本欠划，執貨者心思趨昂，扳持頗勁，故供源寥寥，塲外市勢飛騰，簍生油由廿二萬飛升至廿三萬五千元收盤，桶生油上騰三萬至三萬五千元不等，豆油亦昂三萬元，小車蔴油，本係花色，漲勢允俏，狂升五六千元，淸油價達廿萬元大關。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>各貨齊步飛揚，黄豆供樣稀少，價再漲三五千元不等，赤豆客本互納，勁升三四千元，芝蔴菉豆無不追綜而上，豆餅客銷仍暢，投機份子亦衆，漲勢若在，猛跳五千元，生仁則猛跳二萬餘元。</p>
<h3>維持本市民食　市府自有辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據社會局糧食科長士明齊稱：本市現存洋米充沛，民食不用顧慮。目前制止本市白粳黑市賣買，則產地價自會低落。對食米問題，吳市長自有辦法。現社會局正派員會同警局行政處便衣人員，嚴厲取締黑市情形。米號如被查獲者，先吊取賬册審核，然後移送法院辦理。但一般米商皆狡猾多計，如晋盛昌米廠之賬册，祗寫有一頁，且係活頁云。</p>
<h3>各地金價</h3>

<h3>華股買風強烈　紛紛宣告漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨飛黄騰達，幾乎全部漲停，若永紗等竟有貼價至七十元者，亦有成交，惟漲後隨金市之進退，而現　忽。晨開見疲，一三三號一七一號供，先高後低，　永紗退至一〇五五元，　父一〇六〇元。金價大漲，二二四號七六號等猛進，軋空勢成，遞交突盤漲至一一六〇元，一二號二〇號七九號二〇七號九七號三六號有售，曾迫低至一一三五元，無如金市狂跳，漲停板者累累，買氣逾恒，一四五號二三六號八五號八三號二〇七號二二四號七六號二八號均進，三六號大事補空，於是永紗現遞同吿漲停矣。塲內各股漲停者達十分之九，暗市貼價遞永紗達照加三十元，一七一號四九號一八〇號逢高紛紛脫手，近午曾起回跌，遞永紗降爲一二八〇一元，但午收仍在漲停限度以上。結果較上週六計永紗景福華與勤與均漲成半，美亞信和新光均漲一成强，而接近停板。冷股除中紡國貨內衣景綸升一成，　安水泥升半成左右，餘均漲停。　交（週五交割〕永紗華　漲停，美亞信和新光升一成强，週二交割之遞交，無甚成成交，故略。午後傳有大員蒞滬，不無戒心，遞永紗上塲曾退至一二七五元，七一號八三號二三五號等均進，復吿漲停。二八號一一七號二三二號均進，曾照停板加七十元有成交。此時塲內除景綸新亞國貨麗安商務外，均吿漲停。旋因一九八號一九七號二二號八五號一一二號一再供售，金價亦回，終於步退至漲停以下。四九號一四五號一九八號一四號九九號再售，場外亦小，遞交亦降至一一二元，是時漲停者亦次第减少。惟二一九號二八號一八八號一七九號七九號二一八號紛紛補進，最後復迫近停板價。結果較上週六計永紗華　景福各漲成半光景，美亞信和勤興各升一成有零，新光一成弱，遞交（週五交割）永紗華豐漲成半，美亞信和升一成强，新光一成弱，（週二交割）成交有限。僅華豐永紗吿漲停外，餘均無市。冷股中絲永公五和永業內衣漲停，商務火柴水泥九福統益中紡曾吿漲停，最後稍回。麗安景綸國貨各升一成左右，新亞平平。塲外各股中法世界尙平，餘均挺昇。</p>
<p>外股昨西商樂團仍納，證劵帮則有脫手，高後轉盤，怡紗高價一四四〇〇元，而後小盤，英聯會德豐業廣恰啤等均以高價結束，結果較上週六計航業鋼業漲三成弱，會德豐英聯紙業怡啤升二成强，怡紗漲二成弱，餘升一成有零。</p>

<h3>注視今日和今後的山東戰局</h3>
<p>— 济南五日航訊　本報特派員麗天</p>
<p>一般說來，共軍的主力是集中在三個要點：一是陝北，二是東北，三是山東，而由於地形，物產，歷史，人文諸因素，在這三個要點中，尤以山東最為頑强，遠在上月八日，記者在「山東之　」一文中，即已指出：山東可能成為抗戰前北伐後的江西第二，它將成為中共最頑强，最有力，同時也是最後的根據地，政府還是任令坐大，養　貽患呢？還是乘其根基初固，「攻其所必守」？依據目下事實演變情形看，無疑義的，政府也正遵循着後一條路綫。</p>
<h3>陳毅部隊　一鉗三路</h3>
<p>這裏的所謂山東，就中共的政治區劃說，應陳毅的山東軍區和圍繞在其附近的劉伯誠的冀魯晋豫邊區及粟裕的蘇魯邊區。蘇魯邊區到去年年底，除　榆郝鵬舉部及宿遷以北鐵路以南，運河以西三角地區內所殘存的粟裕主力一部外，其餘大部已流竄入魯，故蘇魯邊區在實際上可說已經不存在。</p>
<p>本年一月，共軍曾在山東南部發動了空前未有的大攻勢，集中了新四軍六個師，解放師七個師，新編師五個師，徐向前的第一一五師，劉伯誠的六個縱隊（每個縱隊六個團）及警備旅獨立團，基幹團子弟兵等總數不下四十萬人，以徐州為目標，陳毅劉伯誠為首腦，分自魯南魯西以鉗形攻勢姿態向國軍猛烈攻擊，陳毅的一鉗計分三路：</p>
<p>第一路由臨沂經向城，蘭陵，下嶧縣，佔棗莊後，復興滕縣南下共軍會攻臨城。</p>
<p>第二路由臨沂南下邳縣後，回師西北，側攻台兒莊。</p>
<p>第三路由臨沂南下奪郯城，侵砲車，越隴海路，與集結在宿遷以北共軍會師於窰灣。至此，年前打通的隴海路徐海段遂又開了個大缺口。</p>
<h3>劉伯誠部　侵攻魯西南</h3>
<p>另外，在共軍中素有「獨眼龍小諸葛」之稱的劉伯誠的一鉗，乃自冀魯晋豫邊區分若干股南下魯西南，下城武，佔定陶，陷曹縣，侵單縣，至一月底，除金鄉，濟寗，魚台，菏澤，仍在國軍手中外，其餘鐵路以西，黃河以南，整個魯西南皆入共軍之手。不僅如此，劉伯誠部且跟蹤直下，一度鑽隙佔領了商邱以東的小壩車站，同時，永城，民權，碼山及徐州西南　縣附近地區也傳來了槍聲，蘇皖豫邊區的張太生等部亦分向渦陽，毫縣，鹿邑，柘城等地肆擾，渦陽於一月初且一度被共軍佔領，於是隴海綫鄭徐段也被逼着不得不停駛。徐州的局勢至此亦呈緊張。</p>
<p>這正是陰曆年前後的情形：國軍扼守徐州，東西兩面的隴海路都在癱瘓狀態中，津浦路南段雖可能浦口，而北段則僅至臨城。共軍此種鉗形攻勢，很明顯地已收到若干分攻夾擊之效，而接近成功的邊緣，這種惡劣的態勢一不改善，即令徐州仍能保持光榮的孤立，無奈宿遷一日後威脅，蘇北便一日不得寗靜，魯南魯西南一日不收復，津浦路臨濟段也便打通無望。</p>
<h3>國軍爭收主動　共軍腹背受創</h3>
<p>國軍處在這種極其不利的地位，直到一月廿十八日徐海段鐵路重又打通，郝鵬舉部反正，緊接着蘇北最後一縣贛榆的收復，徐州東側的威脅一掃而光，共軍的兩鉗已被解決了一鉗，不利的局勢才逐漸地被扭轉過來。</p>
<p>繼續下來，國軍為爭取主動，於本月一日起向魯南共軍正式發動反攻，當日下午四時王耀武舊部的張靈甫師首傳捷報，克復郯城，至三日該部已越城北四十五華里的李家莊，直撲魯共陳毅最高司令台的臨沂，同時另一支郝鵬舉部，亦已渡過沂河，到達指定地點，待命前進，臨沂共軍顯已動搖，臨沂之攻克可計日以待。同時魯中國軍霍守義部亦自博山南下，於四日收復萊無，襲擊共軍側背。無疑義的，共軍此時已又由作戰初期的優勢轉為劣勢，而陷於首尾不相顧腹背全受敵的慘境。</p>
<h3>戰事重心　打通津浦綫</h3>
<p>不過，問題又須向西看：魯南戰事的發展，對國軍雖已由劣勢而日趨於有利形態，然如劉伯誠所部在蘇魯皖豫邊區竄擾所給予徐州西側的威脅一天未消除，魯南的國軍也便一天不能長驅北進。加以地形的限制，臨沂以北沂蒙山區，崗　起伏，難攻易守，因此，即使國軍底定臨沂，　縣，棗莊後，亦很可能暫緩北進，而以主力協同徐州外圍國軍，由濟寗魚台直搗魯西大平原，然後沿運河兩岸，齊頭北進，直抵黃河邊，再轉斾東向將共軍　　泰山山脈而入沂蒙山區，如此，臨濟段鐵路的打通才是真正的打通，其安全也才可確保無虞。</p>
<p>這一個戰略的連用，從表面上看去似乎太迂遠，實質上只有這樣做才是對國軍最為有利。花園口堵口以後，黃河河水循故道已越濟南東流入海，這由魯西南橫貫魯東北的滔滔黃水，無異橫插入魯共胸部的一柄利劍，生生地把魯境共軍截成兩段，予共軍運動調遣上一個最大的障碍，共軍的反對花園口堵口，並非真正有愛於黃河故道的少數居民，相反地，國軍正應提防着在他日河水高漲，國軍前進時，共軍的決堤，以阻遲國軍前進。</p>
<p>總括整個大局看起來，魯南的戰事應該暫止於臨沂　縣和棗莊的收復。此後戰事的重心就將移至魯西南和魯西，直到津浦路徐濟段打通為止。臨蒙山區和山東半島的共軍可能暫被阻遏在一邊，（如於此時同時解決，則非以壓倒的優勢兵力自南北西三面包圍襲擊不為功。）這樣北上的國軍，使可與天津南下的部隊會師滄州而打通全部津浦路。</p>
<h3>平漢北段一而壯史　定縣兩萬軍民　突圍北撤</h3>
<p>— ·保定一日航訊　本報保定記者楊炳森·</p>
<p>農歷除夕前夜，冀境共軍復發動平漢北段保定石家莊間攻勢，一月二十日晚侵陷望都後，即分由南北夾擊定縣。守軍苦戰八日，終因衆寡不敵，被共軍攻佔。該城軍官民兩萬餘人，突圍北退保定。記者今晨赴保定省立醫院訪問負傷之安平縣長劉家秀，得悉定縣血戰詳情，目怵心傷，令人唏噓不置。</p>
<p>苦鬥了八晝夜　抗拒十萬共軍</p>
<p>此次發動保石段攻勢之共軍，為盤踞冀西聶榮臻指揮之楊蘇縱隊一部，及各軍分區正規軍已兵，并傳有劉伯誠部等共達約十萬人，且裝備精良，自陷望都後，相繼侵佔清風店，明月店，寨西店，新樂，東長壽等各重要據點，而實行以三萬餘主力軍對定縣之包圍戰。</p>
<p>定縣為平漢北段重鎮，戰前係河北省一等模範縣。晏陽初先生曾於此地辦理平民教育多年，文風頗盛。城垣週圍達四十里，并以出產鴨梨，松椒酒著稱。</p>
<p>一月二十日晚，望都失守後，當時定縣方面，即急派援軍兩個中隊北上接應，中途遭十倍之共軍截擊，致全軍覆沒，共方則順勢急馳南下，砲毀清風店至定縣間之國軍碉堡，遂包圍車站，展開城郊猛烈攻防戰。</p>
<p>兩軍死拚數日夜，至廿七日共軍繼續由平漢路側增達三萬餘名，兵臨城下，車站告陷。至圍攻之第八日（一月廿八日）晨，共軍集中萬餘兵力猛攻城東南角，連射五十餘砲未逞，嗣又全力進攻城西北角，砲擊十餘發後，城牆被毀，共軍乘勢一擁而入，縣城遂告失陷。</p>
<p>守軍三千　各剩子彈八顆</p>
<p>縣城甫被圍攻時，全城人士，莫不期盼援軍早臨，以解危難，對空運補給，尤望眼欲穿，指揮官冀省第九區專員崔子信，曾向保定方面連發數電請援，其緊急可知。</p>
<p>共軍砲火，日益猛烈，直到城內守軍三千餘名，每人祗能分得八顆子彈時，始接到二十七日飛機空運不給，務在城西側用紅布舖地為信號，以便投送之命令，當時實已四面楚歌，瀕最危險階段，且石家莊北上援軍，又受阻未進，新樂亦告失陷，大勢已去，挽救也來不及。</p>
<p>突圍途中　婦孺哭聲震天</p>
<p>二十八日午，共軍侵入縣城後，城內軍官民約兩萬餘人，紛向城外逃奔，彼時最高指揮官崔子信氏，發令掩護撤退，於是武裝人員，整頓槍枝，準備突圍。</p>
<p>共軍惴測守軍突圍，決向石家莊方面撤退，故北部砲火特別猛烈，密如雨點。衝圍人員，臨時決定向保定方面退却。兩萬餘人，出城北行十餘里時，即遭共軍首次堵擊，傷亡大半，老少婦孺哭聲震天，慘不忍聞。</p>
<p>崔專員殉難前　高呼同志前進</p>
<p>渡過首次難關時，夜幕已下，全隊繞望都縣側面，繼續北進，但沿途共軍一望無際，寸步難移，到處遭受截擊，旋進旋退，徬徨莫定。行經望都縣城西劉屯時，又遭共軍萬餘包圍，瀕臨絕境。在共軍機槍　形　蕩下，又死亡大部。崔子信專員身受數處重大創傷，猶在忍痛高呼：「同志同胞，請速突圍前進！」時共軍遍野而來，崔氏不甘為敵俘，假衛兵不防，自戕殞命。定縣縣長賈濟川，亦以身殉。至廿九夜逃來保定者，軍民人等仍源源不絕。刻官方正予收容，力謀善後決策。</p>
<h3>粵省積極展開　五年建設計劃　第一期決自本年度實施</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風　·四日廣州航訊·</p>
<p>經過八個月時間草擬，參加專家達二百餘人研討的粵省五年建設計劃，已全部脫稿了，而且決定第一期計劃由本年度開始實施，其重心側重於建設生產部門。這一消息，誠然是三千五百萬粵人的福音，因為粵省在戰時淪陷逾七年之久，淪陷面積在三分之二以上，所有富庶地區，無不受敵偽蹂躪損失慘重，所以復興建設實為當前的急務，也就是根本解決本省民生大計最重要的課題。</p>
<p>廣東是糧食不足自給的省份，若言建設，當以農業增產為整個建設事業之首要，其次那為交通之復員，因如目前交通之困難，亦足以影響一切事業的發展，所以復員後本省省政當局，在「從整理中求復員，從復員中求建設」這一原則之下，積極興辦農田水利，使糧食生產得以增加，同時急謀公路的修復，使社會的脈絡貫通。在過去一年間，粵省建設當局即以此為中心工作，而且曾收到相當的成果，這實足作為建設新廣東的石基。</p>
<p>水利工程　查勘設計</p>
<p>先說農田水利建設，在當局積極推行之下，曾先後在省內四十六個地方組成洋洋水利協會，和二百廿九灌溉生產合作社，並派出查勘隊兩隊，測量隊十隊，負責各個水利工程的查勘和設計。計已查勘完竣的，有茫化·溫泉等九區，面積二七二·五〇〇市畝，水電三千五百匹馬力。測量完竣的，有花縣灌溉區等十六區，面積共二四四·〇〇〇市畝，水電六萬七千匹馬力，排水道四十公里。設計完竣的，有梅縣等十二區灌溉工程，面積共二六三·五〇〇市畝，水電四百匹馬力。已施工完竣的，有要明十三圍防潦工程，受益田畝達十二萬市畝，及各縣方面完成塘渠堤圳等小型水利工程一千零六十宗。</p>
<p>除上述外，目前在鳩工中者，尚有惠陽馬鞍圍，曲江楓灣水與老　水庫，東莞懷德鄉等灌溉工程。其中最大的惠陽馬鞍圍工程，現已每日動員萬餘人工作，預算需一百多個睛天才能竣工，完成後受益田畝達二十餘萬市畝，能增產米糧四十餘萬担。其餘曲江及東莞兩縣水利工程完成後，亦可使三萬餘畝農田受益，這些工程一經完成，當然大有助於粵省糧食問題的解決。</p>
<p>徵工修路　獎勵民營</p>
<p>至於交通方面，建設當局首謀搶修公路。戰前粵全省原有公路一萬四千五百一十八公里，惟戰時破壞甚多，勝利復員時僅存四百一十七公里。如要將全部公路恢復戰前狀况，曾預計需款達三千餘億元，這是省當局無從負担的數目。所以當局曾訂定了兩個辦法：一是在各縣徵工修路，利用國民義務勞動，並計值給股，以維護他們勞動的利益；二是獎勵民營公路路權人修復原築路段，並保障其路權。在這兩個辦法推行之下，果然收到很大效果，計目前已搶修通車的公路有廣紹，廣九，韶小，官興，湛石，廣花等綫，共長五千一百八十公里。同時，本省由廣州至汕頭與廣州至梅菉之東南兩大幹綫，現在積極修復。計東綫的廣增公路，長七十五公里，早已修復通車。其餘由增城至汕頭長四四八，五公里，正在興工修築中。南綫廣雲公路等長一八六·五公里已修復通車，並修復路基約有化廉路等共長一九八·四公里，已興工修築的，有新開路等共長一〇九〇·一公里。這兩大幹綫是由粵建廳向粵善救分署領得賑米三千四百噸，以工代賑招集民工修建，大約在今年兩季之前，即可全部完成通車了。</p>
<p>工業危機　急圖解救</p>
<p>在工業方面：由於洋貨傾銷，走私猖獗等原因，致民營工業一蹶不振；當局曾針對着現實問題，而替他們解決了若干困難。至省營工廠，亦在陸續着手恢復；現已復工的，計有西村士敏土廠，飲料廠，製冰廠，釀造廠，紡織廠，順德糖廠等。在遷移中的，有信宜蔴織廠，樂昌交通器材廠，機器廠，印刷廠等。籌備復員中的，有西村硫酸廠，茂名糖廠及揭陽糖廠等。其中規模較大的西村士敏土廠，在戰前每天產量達六百噸，但淪陷後一部份機器被搬走東北，其餘一部份亦損壞不堪，後將局部機器修復，暫時開工僅能日出二百噸。最近善救分署答允配售二千五百　瓦（KW）發電機一套及製土機一套，預算在今年六月間，即可恢復戰前的產量。以外粵省原有一省營紙廠，亦是國內規模較大的紙廠之一，因淪陷時被敵人將機器全部拆運至北海道勇沸設廠開工，現省當局正請中央與盟軍總部交涉運回，可是還沒有結果哩。</p>
<p>促進礦業　爭取投資</p>
<p>其次關於礦業方面：粵省礦藏，本甚豐饒；總計全省新舊礦區達一千二百八十餘處，總面積達七萬四百餘公頃，礦產種類有金，錫，鐵，鋼，鎢，　，鉏，鉛，　，錳，煤，石墨，砒，磁土，雲石，雲母，硫磺，石膏，石棉，重質石等，分佈於七十餘縣。現省當局推進礦業的第一步驟，是整理原有礦區，經整理保留的礦，設法予以促進；並為獎助民營礦業，曾請中央舉辦礦業貸款；至粵建廳最近決定規復的工礦，計有乳源八字嶺狗牙洞的煤礦，英德八寶山硫磺山鐵礦，雲浮烏石嶺等處鐵礦，合浦金牛山及防城大直墟等猛礦，茂名公館墟及電白羊角墟油灰岩礦，翁源始與從化樂昌雲浮五縣之鎢猛銅礦，花縣石灰石礦，曲江樂昌乳源陽山等處　礦，西沙羣島的磷礦等。開發此項礦藏，實為奠定現代化工業的基礎，當局曾已組織若干礦區調查隊分別普查，而且已定了開採的辦法，不過目前成問題的，恐怕還是開發的資本問題；所以現在極力爭取僑胞投資歸國，使能地盡其利，物盡其用，這對新廣東的建設，自然會縮短了不少的路程吧。</p>

<h3>從光榮的船廠　進向吉林</h3>
<p>— 永吉二日航訊　胡景文</p>
<p>號稱三省之一的「吉林」，雖已成為歷史上的名字，然而那山川廻抱的氣勢，肥美豐饒的寶蔵，却不能由此而泯滅了她底身價，十四年的壓榨，兩次嚴重的剝削，曾使這碩大疆域消瘦了不少，然而她却能在困難中重新健壯起來。</p>
<p>「船廠」，是吉林的舊稱呼，我們却不能因她腐舊，而忘了順治十五年，因防俄羅斯進犯，遂在這個地方造戰船一而富有意義的史實，後來置了省會，改為「吉林」，在民國二年時改縣，十九年因為省縣同名，遂又呌做「永吉」。</p>
<p>九一八事變，「吉林」在日人統制分分割下，為了地勢的構成，把她縮减了，依着天然的賜與，人力的挽救，使日人獲得了無數利益，於是邊區重鎮，又負起了中心担子，形成了東北的活血大動脈。</p>
<p>河山光復，政府為了配合政治·經濟·軍事·地理等要求，把東北劃成了九省二市，於是屢經滄桑的「吉林」，又有了一個新姿態。</p>
<p>輸血路</p>
<p>「吉林」市內唯一的交通工具，除了各都市所有的三輪車，馬車而外，要算是由車站開到省政府門前的公共汽車了，然而這好像是「有名無實」的，因為時常等了半天見不到汽車影子，遂造成了馬車生意蓬勃現象。據當地人說：「過去日本鬼子，不但專輛分配得當，而且完成了主要市內幹綫，穿越臨江門可達最高學府的吉林師大，交通是很方便的。」</p>
<p>吉長，吉海，吉敦，三條掌握「吉林」命脈的鐵路幹綫，現在除了共軍控制和破壞的以外，僅有吉海，和吉長兩條路可能，然而吉海又因為　海綫的滯阻，僅僅的使它行駛到梅河口車站吧了。</p>
<p>吉長路全長一百二十七·七四一公里，它今年已是三十六個週歲了，正是雄赳赳的時期，沿綫主要車站有樺皮廠，土們嶺，下九台等，並且過都是溝通吉長間的商場，政府為了保護這吉長輸血動脈，沿綫派了許多英勇國軍，築了好些堡壘，給了軍民許多便利。</p>
<p>蜿蜒二百四十華里的吉長公路，已在困難中完成了，每日對開汽車，又給與了人們一些幫助，使吉林在交通梗塞的時期裏，由沉寂，枯竭，而喘出了一絲氣息。</p>
<p>文化圈</p>
<p>由於過去位處邊陲，少有智識分子來往的原故，給「吉林」形成了腐舊拘泥的形態，雖然國家在這裏也曾花費了好多金錢，建設學校，培植英才，但終較落後，不幸，後來又遭到了日人的蹂躪，受創受毒益深。</p>
<p>政府收復「吉林」以來，先後重使它們揚起樹人的旗幟，一掃過去頹廢學氣，恢復學制，尊重實學，陶冶師資，提高教育，擴大充初等學校，設立民衆教育館，更移思想，徹底撲滅文盲，成立青年補班習，補救敵偽的荒謬愚塞教育，領導民智的報館，也像雨後春筍般地生根起來，計有長白，吉林等報成立，有這許多培植民衆的圓　，吉林的文化不難迎頭趕上了。然而，我們若看一看最高學府「師大」內的教學設備，怕又會引起失望吧！</p>
<p>在吉林西關臨江門外十五華里，有一個地方，呌做八百壠。遼闊的廣場當中，屹立着數座以石疊成的樓房，那便是國立長白師範學院了。</p>
<p>九·一八後，日人在這成立「吉林師道大學」，那時僅有學生二三百人，校舍尚稱够用，現在舊生及新生的人數，已超過了五百人，而依然在兩座側廳內上課，仍然在一座宿舍裏面食住，這未免令許許多多的莘莘學子担心了。</p>
<p>新展望</p>
<p>「吉林」雖我不負有瀋陽和長春的大希望，然而我們若以地勢看來，却不能把她忽略了。她是具有東邊防務屏障責任的也是東邊政治中心的重鎮，更是吉敦，吉同，東部中的商業吐納口，即以一度稱做首都的長春，又何嘗不是仰仗它的供養？</p>
<p>我們如果再進一步檢討到它底本身，那麼請看看內部的情形，由於天然賦與它的多山體態，於是在植物方面，擁有人參，木材，大豆，豆油，豆餅，米，麥，木耳，黃　等龐大的生產，動物方面，像貂，狗熊，狐狸，馬，牛，羊，猪等也繁殖頗多，據民三十年關於荒地的統計，有着九·〇九六·三五　之多，由於這個廣大數目字看來，其待墾之地正多。我們為了經濟繁榮，生產向上，應當盡力來培植耕耘，使瘠土變成肥田，童山變成森林，在這事事建設的口號下，若再能使交通綫，織成交通網，那麼未來的吉林，當更有無窮的希望！</p>

<h3>你的孩子是神童麼？　孩子入學問題</h3>
<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>近來在報上常看到發現「神童」消息，在廣西有一個，在江蘇有一個，什麽一歲識字，二歲能讀文，三歲能寫字，四歲能作文，五歲能咏詩等等，是眞是假，還在其次，却有多少作父母者羨慕着，以爲天賜麟兒，無論際此原子時代，談不到迷信與封建思想，便是對孩子的入學求知，也是値得討論的一個問題。筆者前服務小敎凡十餘年，對此問題，略有見解，敢爲貢獻一點意見，作凡爲父母者之參考。</p>
<p>白居易生七月，便識之無二字，其實不希罕。筆者亡兒生六月，也能認識一「上」字，固然敏於常兒，但爲不壽之相。因孩子智力有限，爲父母者宜保養其腦力，勿使過用爲要。往往有爲父母者，在孩子呀呀學語時，便敎孩子識字，甚有說我的孩子只五歲，能識幾百字爲誇耀，其實無異新傷孩子的腦力，摧殘孩十的生命。</p>
<p>人之智愚天賦各有不同，但有比較聰明，比較　　，甚少絕頂聰明和絕頂愚魯的。因此有些父母，爲孩子過早入學，可是成績惡劣，看去天資遲鈍，以爲不堪造就，頗感灰心，這也大可不必。因有人知識開早，有人知識開遲，往往見有些兒童，在七八歲時，成績優異，試輒名列前茅；可是入中學反見退化，實爲幼年用腦太過，正同「江朗才盡」以後反成愚魯，也是有的。但也有在七八歲時，成績低下，試列榜末；但進了中學，反進步奇速，這正是爲他智力方開，初試身手也。因此爲父母者，應注意孩子的智力，切勿望之太奢，督之太嚴。</p>
<p>王勃作勝王閣賦，才華橫溢，一賦成名，可是終於短命；民初徐血兒，不上二十歲，便當了報館主筆，文思超羣，一筆通天，但也不壽。可見人之智力，到底有限，如一缸之水，先挹先涸，凡爲父母者，大可不必希望自己的子女當個神童，連孩子識字入學諸問題，也要酌量年齡纔好呢！</p>
<p>兒童入學年齡，按照敎育部規定，以足六歲入小學爲合格，前二年入幼稚園，實具至理。方今開學期近，有些父母急急乎想送子女入學，不能不顧到年齡問題。若未足六齡實以不送入學爲是，只送入幼稚園。</p>
<p>不過，要附帶提及的！有些學校設有所謂預備班，旣無正式授課，惟以敷衍爲事；而爲父母者，亦以爲兒實在家吵鬧，不妨去「關蠻」。其實孩子活潑好動，吵鬧是其天性，若說「關蠻」，竟把兒童當犯人看待怎麽說呢，父母對子女固不可望之太切，但如實行「關蠻」消沉他的志氣，受不正常的敎育，反使他馬覺入學之無趣，由是年齡漸長，但　求學之念，印象惡劣，也許他本來是神　却被斷傷。</p>
<h3>也談瞎眼奶</h3>
<p>— 泉</p>
<p>二月四日本擒，籃　君，「勝眼奶古醫法，」不無懐疑，不得不再來一點補充，好在我人爲真理的討論，想　　君當不以</p>
<p>所謂瞎限奶，殆即奶頭平陷，致嬰兒不易吮吸之謂，這是初產婦常有之現象。乳部發達不健全雖是一部分的原因，但在懐孕期的衣服緊束，不加注意，則爲最大之一因。我人應知造化神奇，不可患議，當女人懐孕後，由內分泌刺激素的關係，自然而然的乳部發達，預備爲嬰兒製造　食糧，同時乳頭色素增進，褐疉加深。初姙婦女在分娩之前，應時常以淸水或淡酒精洗滌乳頭，並以指頭輕輕撿弄，一以使乳頭血液循環良好局部發育完全，一以使該部組織鬆軟，以免娩後嬰兒吮吸時疼痛脫皮或乳法鬱積脹痛化膿等痛苦。</p>
<p>如果未曾如此預防，而娩後不能吮乳，仍應用矯形的方法補救，即溫洗溫罨捻弄，再令較大兒，或成人輕輕口吮。黄省肉棒當歸等藥，是補藥，有促進乳汁分泌作用，其功不容泯滅，若施用於衰弱體質之乳汁不足，而乳房平塌者，自當大有著效，如用於乳頭平陷不能吮吸，致乳房脹痛者，恐不能獲預期之功。氳　君之經騐，殆屬諸前者，希望讀者加以鑒別。（却酬）</p>
<h3>適應妳的年齡</h3>
<p>— 鋼人</p>
<p>這裏有一句話，可以永遠地去掛在一個女子所不能離開的鏡子旁邊，每天給他的女主人，一個提示：「要適腦妳的年齡！」</p>
<p>這短短的七個字，已包括了一個女子要永遠地保持她的動人的姿態的一切原理和方法；但是相信的女子太少了，她們祗醉心於這樣的觀念，就是說祗有年靑是女子最重要的東西。所以她們在她離開衰老還很還時，就認爲自己已經枯萎了。</p>
<p>這就給女子們戴上一副悲哀的眼鏡，縱然她們有豐富的知識去斷定她是在什麼時代；但在她們看來，不把自己裝飾得像她女兒樣地年輕，盡各方面的努力來掩飾她的年齡，是不能表現出她的美來的。</p>
<p>年齡是在亮不留情地召喚，帶來了年老的姿態。一個女子，她不能用特效的粧品·藥物來改造她的老態，正和她不能使靑春永駐一樣。</p>
<p>這樣最可惜的。她祇在找回靑春的岐途徘徊，悲哀和煩惱，而忽略了她應走的大道。</p>
<p>年齡，祗有當妳和他固執和盲目地爭鬥時，才是一個不可克服的敵人；如果妳能適應他，可能是一個良好的友人。</p>
<p>有許多到了中年的女子，她依，像少女樣地美麗，動人，就是她能適應她的年齡，她的時代，在熟鍊和均衡的方法下，盡量地發揮好的美點。</p>
<p>要使三四十歲的女子和十八歲少女一樣甜美，那是不可能的；而極力在顏面上用化壯品來文飾，也是最愚蠢的事。</p>
<p>一個美好·幽雅·平靜的美的面容，屬於那一個時代的女子；一個活潑·天眞的儀態，屬於那一些年齡的女子是不能互換的。一個時代，就是一種美。</p>
<p>祗有那些自尋煩惱的女子，她堅決地否定她的時代，走上那錯誤的道路，在年靑的時候，放棄她的靑春的美，而在年長的時候，去裝少女的儀容，做出嬌羞的行動，和一切年青人的動作；沒有人會不覺得的她醜惡吧？</p>
<p>她忽略了一種必能成功的方法，無論是她的美，夫妻間的感情，總是一個能適應她的年齡，發揮她個性的美的女子。最能保持。</p>
<p>要知道，每一時期的女子，有她特定的個性，特定的美；要有眞正永恒的美，惟有正視現實，適應她自己的年齡！（本文根據狄斯女士Beyour　age作）</p>
<h3>使用經濟油爐</h3>
<p>— 歸燕</p>
<p>勝利後，火油從美國源源運輸而來，所以通商大埠人民所用的燃料，也大部取給於牠了。</p>
<p>戰前會經發明的「經濟油爐」，到了今天，也應運復生。不過這十幾年裏面，國人還沒有把　製成合乎保險的標準，所以常有因此而造成火災的事情。</p>
<p>筆者根據了多年使用的經騐在該項油爐，沒有澈底改善之前，特地羅列若干種，可以避免災禍的要點，指陳出來，以期可以减少一些福患。同時希望襲造的商人們，也能够根據了吾的下文，加以盡善盡美的改進。</p>
<p>經濟爐肇事，十分之九是爲了下部儲油器的爆裂。因爲這儲油器是銅質的，大槪因了成本關係，並不是整塊軋成，而在鑲口處，却用錫焊的。因此耐不住長時間的熱力烘灼，傳到了底層，　錫漸漸熔解，那儲油器便自行解體，於是油淌了出來，直觸着火勢，就不可收拾了。</p>
<p>但是使用人切不可驚慌，假使旁邊有空鉛桶的話，赶緊合覆上去。或用被絮掩蓋上去，也同樣能够遏熄火焰的。有黄沙當然更好了，牠能把火勢消滅個淨盡，不過用水燒，似乎力量最薄弱了。</p>
<p>要防止儲油器炸裂起見，燃燒的時間，應有節制；夏天至多用兩小時，備油器已經發燙，須要休止了。冬季却可以用到三小時。製造者的說明書，雖說在燃火時，也可以加注火油的。但是爲了議愼起見，最好在燃點時，中途不要加油。萬一必須加油，應該熄滅了火，再加注進去。還有在燃點時，使用人切不可走開，應該當心切不可把油點乾。因爲點乾了，熟度膨脹，也容易使爐底脫焊，雖不致釀成災禍，但是又要使上面筒子，多担負一次高熟度的摧燬，和下面燈芯的多半枯焦，就不經濟了。</p>
<p>因爲這爐子　舉鐵架的三根柱子，便插在備油器的本身上，支持力量，常然也有限得很，所以過份重量的鍋子等類，切莫加上去，因爲聽說出事的原因，也有就爲了這三根柱子，不勝載重，而把儲油器的焊錫　裂了，那麽火焰却倒向下面竄去，便立即發生危險了。</p>
<p>在熄火的時候，變壓火力的筒子，須要先行用金屬的撬子取去。（金屬撬子，是該爐的附屬品）。然後輕輕用扇子（不可用口吹）在爐底下，向上揮動，便安全地熄滅了並且一些沒有火油氣味的。假如連筒子在上面，把管制燈芯的旋子旋熄的話，那一股惡臭的味兒，簡直要半小時才消散。侵襲到食品和東西上面以後，一時無法祛除的。</p>
<p>在使用時，火　主低不勻，便要冒烟，且有臭味噴出，宜用金屬撬子在變　壓筒子橫邊的四個小鈎上，帶住了儘量旋轉，到火燄勻均，便沒有上項弊病了。</p>
<p>最後得吿訴使用這東西的諸位家庭主婦們，務須保持牠的淸潔，儲油器外面的殘餘油漬，尤其應該擦淨。</p>
<h3>徵妻</h3>
<p>— 乘之譯</p>
<p>假使尊夫人突然失踪，而你決意登載廣吿，以徵求別人來代替她，那末你的措詞大概是這樣的：「徵求婦女，佐理家務，每星期工作七天，每天工作十八小時，須住宿。並須熟諳烹飪，縫織，醫藥，兒童健康，簿記，初步電學及男子心理。應徵者必須身體强健和自願，能帮助園藝者更佳，沒有工資但供給必需品。」（譯者按：「妻」原來是如此可憐的工作者。）</p>

<h3>再惜周作人</h3>
<p>— 張鳴春</p>
<p>抗戰期間，每當有人告訴我周作人快要附逆的時候，我始終不相信，義務律師似的總替他辯證道：「你們放心，我對他雖素昧平生，這個人無論如何不會做漢奸的，欲問何以見得，因為我讀其書，知其人，信其言。」結果，唉，那知結果出人意表，他真的下海了！</p>
<p>筆者不願惋惜任何漢奸，事實上亦無可惋惜的漢奸，一是一，二是二，漢奸便是漢奸，不能亦不准有任何藉口與托詞；然而我却心惜周作人而口不敢言。</p>
<p>過去讀到周報十九期上鄭振鐸先生的惜周作人，頗有同感。筆者仍覺周氏另有可惜的地方，拉雜書出，以就正於有覽斯文者。</p>
<p>就周氏的文化地位說，他的附逆，給予中國文化人心理方面的惡影響，實在不小；惟就他作惡的行為說，也許抵不到一個偽鄉長一個月的「胡來」，一個偽軍准尉副官一星期的「亂攪」，或由天空飛來大員的一次接受！又查他在附逆後的著作，如「風雨後談」，「秉燭後談」，「書房一角」，「苦口甘口」，「立春以前」諸書看來，却沒有阿諛過日本，嘲諷過中央。在他的演講詞裏，（就南方偽報所發表的說）就連「同生共死，同甘共苦」，「國必統一，黨不可分」，「與友邦携手邁進，共同完遂大東亞聖戰」這一類肉麻話，也少發現。但是他是華北教育總監，道地漢奸，為了國家民族前途計，只有懲治他。十四年徒刑，實是活該。周氏還說：「量刑未免過重，畫餅豈可充飢」，老先生你要知道這已經相當客氣了。「一失足」並不是作冲談小品題目呀。</p>
<p>鄭先生說：「他後來已經是顯得落伍了」。誠然他是落伍了，但他的言論，確也有明智可取的地方，現在積隨便的舉一個例罷。他的「道義要事功化，倫理要生物化」的主張，是很精粹的。關於後一句話的意義，他申述道，世上沒有一部經典，可以千百年來當做人類的教訓的，生物學的知識，可以作為整個人生問題這參考，藉定人類行為的標準。在「談中國的思想問題」中，他更地一步說，飲食以求個體之生存，男女以求種族之生存，這本是一切生物的本能，進化論者所謂意志。人也是動物，所以這本能自然也是有的，不過一般生物的求生是單純的只要達到生存的目的，便不問手段，只要自己能够生存，便不惜危害別個的生存。人則不然，他與生物同樣的要求生存，但最初覺得單獨不能達到目的，須得與別個連絡，互相扶助，方能好好的生存；隨後又感到別人也與自己同樣約有好惡，設法圓滿的相處。前者是生存的方法，動物中也有能够做到的；後者乃是人所獨有的生存道德。古人云「人之所以異於禽獸者幾希」蓋即此也。接着他說，中國國民的中心思想之最高點為仁，即是此原始的生存道德所發達而成功，如不從生物學的立脚地來看，不能了解其意義之深厚，這些都是很明凈的雅言，我恐怕他諸如此類不可勝舉的議論，將隨他漢奸的污名而遭唾棄，隨時間而漸　沒。中國的古訓「不人以廢言」，而歷史上的事實正相反不僅以人廢言，並將廢及其人之其他長處的。朱　臨模曹操的字，頗遭友人的議刺。蘇州黃門弟子鐘某，欲印行嚴高的鈐山堂　子，同門反對，至於互毆。興化有嚴世蕃所書「狀元境」三字大匾，字體高妙，後人因不值世蕃其人，就將下款鋸去，若非長老提示，已不知為淮人手筆了。</p>
<p>至於王覺斯，阮大　，趙文華輩，皆以其人格有缺，而縮小了他們藝術文章應得的流播範圍。最顯著的，今日鄭孝胥的字，已恥懸壁上；汪兆銘的書，都羞置案頭；同佛海在江蘇各校所題碑匾之類，其本人姓字蓋遭磨洗了。周作人的著作與書法，自非汪周諸人所能望其項背，然而其命運是可以想像的這，不是值得我們可惜的事嗎？</p>
<p>依鄭先生的漢奸分類法，周作人應屬於教育文化漢奸。教育文化漢奸，除去陳彬　，袁殊，沈啓先等，比較其他政治的，軍事的，經濟的漢奸，都一般的可憐。他們做漢奸後的生活，並不若何優裕，有的且照常貧困。他們決不比其他方面的漢奸，能享富貴榮華，招搖過市。天日重光後，而首遭檢舉與抨擊的是教育文化漢奸，因為教育文化界最講是非，專好議評，而首中筆端與舌端的則是本界的敗類。這是教育文化界值得驕傲同時也是可憐的地方，實在這一類的漢奸，自動的搖身一變的法術較差；被動的被庇護着的機會較少；非常易於措置。試問那些政治上，軍事上，經濟上的，到目前還未落網的漢奸，與正被有力者包庇着的漢奸，徒抱正義感的文化人能奈何他們什麽呢？</p>
<p>所以文教界的人，只能拔去自己眼中的刺，不能拔去別人眼中的梁木，不亦大可哀乎！</p>
<p>至於如何處置周作人，我是非常同意鄭先生的主張的，就是「用一個特別的辦法，囚禁着他，但使他工作着，從事翻譯希臘文學什麽的。」周作人在三十三年八月，在其所作希臘神話引言中有云：「不佞少時，喜弄筆墨，不意地墜入文人道中，有如墮民，雖欲歇業，無由解免，念之痛心，歷有年所矣。或者翻譯家可與文壇稍遠，如真不能免為白丁，倒顯折筆改業為譯人，亦彼善於此，完成神話的譯註，為自己的義務工作，自當儘先做去。此外東西賢哲，嘉言懿行，不可計量，隨緣抄錄，一章半偈，亦是法施。」據此以觀，鄭先生的提議，也許是很適於周氏的罷。</p>
<h3>九妹</h3>
<p>— 秦嶺</p>
<p>舊曆年近的日子，整天淅淅瀝瀝的雨，泥灣處處，土地給揉得滿臉的縐紋，在行路難的嘆息裏，我漸漸走近家，跨進客堂第一個感覺是空落得難受，天色太暗；木被樓房遮往的客堂更有點昏沉沉的。往日，一跑進來，坐在客堂一角的九妹總會低低喚着「姊姊」，然而今天沒有了她的聲音，僅剩一張椅子靜躺在牆角裏。</p>
<p>跑上樓去，一面呌着媽，却不見回答，弟弟躡手躡足從書房裏跑出來。</p>
<p>「媽呢？」</p>
<p>「病着躺在裏邊。」</p>
<p>「九妹那兒去了。」</p>
<p>「死了……」</p>
<p>「死了？」</p>
<p>那個蒼白色的病態的小臉龐立即在我淚水裏浮了上來。九妹不幸生在這苦難的時代裏，事變的第一年隨着奶娘逃避到鄉間，與家內完全隔絕了。等我們回到故鄉再領她來城的時候所見的九妹已患了脊柱性TB。就這樣惡運緊跟住她連續了九年。</p>
<p>我們是個孩子衆多的家庭，作父母的為了照顧太多的孩子而感到不勝疲憊時，孩子們還有因被忽略而致的苦痛與過失，這真是一個綜錯複雜的小社會，能力的强弱在這裏展開了很明顯的競爭。所以，漸漸養成了九妹離羣索店的習慣，她不愛吵，當小哥哥們聚在一起玩笑時，她總默默在帝瞅着，有時候也為他們的喜樂露出點笑容，但不多時候又讓陰霾罩住了，即使爸媽時時護着她，總不免受到男孩子們偷偷的欺侮，結果，在她的性格裏就有着成人氣息的憂鬰。她是個非常倔强的女孩子，受了他人的欺侮便輕輕哭了，然而我們走近時她又抹乾眼淚不響，即使用盡方法詢問她哭的原因，她總是不睬。因為她的孤僻失去了家人的喜愛，因為缺乏家人的溫情她變得更孤僻，就這樣她與我們相隔得日形疏遠了。但即使我們比較生疏，可沒料到上次返家竟是最後的見面，那天她的臉有些腫，精神却還好，匍在凳上獨自折紙兔子玩，時隔半月，我們竟永遠分別了。</p>
<p>在這風雨之夕我回到家裏，已不再看見她孤憂的小面龐，甚至連靈柩也因時近年關而早早埋葬了。除了媽給她收拾起的幾件舊了的小玩具與牆角那只　子外，已不再留有什麽痕跡。她悄悄地把一切屬於她的都帶走了。</p>
<p>活在這苦難的時代裏本不是幸福多活一天不過多遭一點刧難，一點煎熬。但她畢竟活得太短促了，僅是十一年的歲月呵！入世不多時她使負上了極重的病痛，一直讓它磨折到死。在她的一生裏，沒有陽光，沒有歡笑，當她閉上小眼的時候曾憎恨過世間，憎恨過人們麽？母親為她的死而病了，孩子雖多，她老人家總是痛惜的。小哥哥們因往昔的欺侮她今天也流下了悔過的淚，他們低低問我：「九妹現在不恨不恨我們？」</p>
<p>在×鄉的祖瑩帝孤獨的躺着，凄厲的冬風下，墓地是荒寂寥落的，她會不會因這些冷酷的景色而苦着小臉呢……</p>
<h3>小窗</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>沒有綠色的　蘿，沒有精緻的窗紗，也沒有紫絨的帘幕，而却有藍天的白雲，夜的星月點綴了這灰褐的小窗，不要笑我貧乏，我的小窗是矞皇的。</p>
<p>每當寂寞的時候，是黃昏或者是夜晚，總默然的對着這方小天地，這時候，那被遺忘了許久的　色的記憶，又引起我的親切感了，許多懷想，許多憧憬，那此朦朧的感情又偷偷的綴成了一些影像，美麗又眩惑我了！</p>
<p>如今我生活在寂寞裏，而被昨昔的記所眩惑了，那些影像，那無數片段的夢的彩色，確是瑰麗的，然而疊積起來又是一副沉重的担子呢！可是別盡嫌它沉重，它也會給予一點苦難的歡悅，一些懷楚的笑……因此，有時也就忘却了那份莫名的沉重，而愛着那點彩色的瑰麗了。</p>
<p>小窗給了我太豐富的玄想，是當獨自對着小窗沉默的時候，當使我緬懷於煇煌的昨昔，彷彿結成了網的蜘蛛，再循着故舊的軌跡走回去，慢慢的，細心的領略着生命的歷程中以往的悲歡，雖然記憶在眩惑我，但，我並不誇耀記憶的琦豐與豪華，（當然也有辛酸與眼淚的。）修長的人生道路上我只不過走了短短的一程，現在暫時停歇在道旁，只儘儘是想舒一舒些微的喘息，我坐在我的小窗之前，讓自己靈魂獲得圖片刻的休憇。</p>
<p>停留在這兒却有着無邊的寂寞，然而感謝小窗給予的溫馨，我默的領受這點恩寵，如同停留的旅人，回首着自己已走過的一段路程，多少有點安慰，在寂寞裏我正懷着這點心情，溫習着青春的夢華，可是這段路程里我未抬得一莖花草，空虛的。該會有人笑我貧乏吧！</p>
<p>真的，除了這扇小窗，除了這扇小窗所給我記憶的陽光之外，我是一無所有，我失去童稚與天真，失去所有的一切，不，我還留下了一份智慧，憑着這點，使我還能够領略這小窗的溫柔。</p>
<p>我珍惜那逝去的歲月，更珍惜那未來的，我愛戀這灰褐的小窗。</p>
<h3>觀音香市　——揚州續夢之九</h3>
<p>— 洪為法</p>
<p>揚州西北的平山堂是遊曁之區，靠近平山堂的觀音山，便是香拜佛之地。每年從農曆六月初一開始，到十九日為止，例有香市。在這十幾日之中，進香的善男信女是特別多。山下沿河，大小遊船，往來如織，多是香客們乘坐的。也有不乘船遵着陸路走的，因此岸上的香客亦復熙來攘往。從山頂到山脚，兩旁都搭着蘆棚，或是賣香燭，或是買玩具，又或是賣食品，既五光十色，也應有盡有，進香原是大人的事，小孩子却要隨去看熱鬧，這正是捕捉機會。小孩子到了觀音山，見到食品要吃，見到玩具要要，糾纏哭鬧，終於使得大人不容不解囊破費，購買少許。因此，一般賣東西的人便想出種種方法來逗引孩子，提高他們購買的慾念。</p>
<p>這香市在十五日以後最為熱鬧。十九日是觀音聖誕，此日一過，山門關了，也就驟形冷落。現時想來，在過去香市期間最能令人回味的，蓋有兩事。第一事是十八日夜，北門和天寗門多是通夜不閉。進香的人們　暮出城，一舟蕩漾，慢慢的向觀音山進發，進香以後，欲歸便歸，不歸便留在舟中，向瘦西湖駛去，看看月夜的湖山。清歌一曲也好，賦詩幾首也好，更或謔浪嘯傲也好，到了翌晨，才在　風殘月中又復進城。此外亦有慘綠少年或斗方名士趁此良宵，携帶歌妓，羣聚在觀音山一帶　舫中，　板金樽，猜拳行令，盡情歡樂一夜的。　舫之中，燃着汽油燈，遙遙看去，像是一顆顆晶亮的行星，倒映在水裏，閃閃爍爍，更像是一朵朵怒放的銀花。</p>
<p>另一事是在香市時，許多青年學生在山脚下作露天講演，竭力宣傳破除迷信。儘管聽者藐藐，却仍言者諄諄。這種情形，在五四運動時，尤其顯得熱烈。更有基督教的傳教士也在山脚下散佈福音，勸人不要相信泥塑木雕的偶像。因為他們是上帝的子孫，便希望一切人都是上帝的子孫。這對於觀音山的寺院裏和尚們，看似一種打擊，可是香火還是很盛旺，因此他們對於反對者除了唸幾聲阿彌陀佛，也就本着我佛慈悲的精神，寬大為懷了。</p>
<p>不過這香市在抗戰以後便衰落下去。到了抗戰勝利，正好恢復　觀，却又因花符不靖，山上駐了軍隊，進香的人不能任意進出。和尚們也曾想請觀音下山，在山脚下受善男信女的膜拜，終因環境特殊，無法挽回頹勢了。倒是使得另外一處的觀音，因此受到意外的供奉。原來五亭橋畔，有一座陳姓的私人別　，名為　莊。臨河山石下，有一座白石觀音，平時翠竹捷映，凡是遊人舟過此地，多會發生　登彼岸的玄想，自經亂離，　莊的房屋，倒塌不堪，觀音像也便不蔽風雨。不知誰個信徒，將觀音移到鄰近的蓮性寺去。於是過去觀音山的香市，便也隨着到蓮性寺來。一時這白石觀音大受善男信女的膜拜，香火鼎盛，遠非留在　莊時祗是看着往來遊客所可比了。有人說，各地觀音大概也須信賴命運，想來觀音山的觀音在近十年中正是命運多舛哩。</p>

<p>作家趣事</p>
<h3>赫茲力</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>英國詩人批評家兼論文家赫茲力（William　Hazlitt　1778－1830），有一次因事和藍姆（John　Lamb）爭吵，藍姆氣得把赫茲力推倒在地上。後來友人來安慰他，他却說：「他並沒有傷害我，拳頭我也不在乎，况且他並沒有傷害或破壞我的思想。」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　165</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「隊長已經計劃過了」：耀羣答着，隊長即是w君，「要人，要子，要傢伙，都行，只等這邊發動」。</p>
<p>我一聽了這話，心下感到痛快，也着實佩服w君如此爽快果斷；並不像其他中國機關，一個小問題，哪怕請求幾張草紙，幾兩花葉，幾番批駁，幾番加印，而批准與否，還是問題。一件公文出場，就像出場的花旦，先在門簾裏面批起，直到批出了門簾，還要　　嫋嫋，三進三退，做足了張致，直到鑼鼓催到她頭，才肯邁進這們小半步。</p>
<p>鶴見在一旁，靜心聽我問耀羣談話，一雙劍眉，雖很舒坦，兩隻虎目，却是楞着。我怕他心下事多，一時找不清頭緒，便重新把他的密令，和我們計劃過上山西移植辦事處的事，簡略說了幾句。</p>
<p>「老大哥，你別躭心我不懂話」；鶴見似乎在打趣我了；「我些事，哪一個時辰都要在我心下翻騰幾次，還能不明白你二位討論的問題」？</p>
<p>「對！」小老虎忽地來了這麽一聲，好像聽戲的在喝采捧場；可我就不明白他這個「對」字指的什麽，目標在那裏。</p>
<p>「早不成問題。」鶴見對小老虎點了點頭，表示接受他的采，一面繼續說，「我的經濟，現在又多了一個來源，是老頭兒供給的，儘管用。器械更不成問題，儘管揀精　的問我要。只這「人」的問題，那要請耀小姐和小老師（批虎城）費心一二了」。所說的「老頭兒」，乃是指的近衛。</p>
<p>「對」！小老虎又來了一個采，「不，……我是說「人」的話，　子裏可以搬些來，問我大伯要，他不能不給。反正在哪兒也是打鬼子。」</p>
<p>「對！……」鶴見也看虎城捧場了。「不過我很奇怪，」鶴見單瞧着我，「現在的小姐們，怎麼都這們厲害起來了！」鶴見說到這裏，臉頰又有些漲紅了。「我是說，山西那個地方，有些怪討厭。呌我去，我就不大願意；地方又　，交通又困難，…還有什麽紅槍黑槍！……」</p>
<p>我這才明白鶴見為什麽楞着眼睛呆想，原來他在替耀羣設身處地打算，聽他的口氣，大概也很佩服耀羣如此的勇敢。</p>
<p>電話玲響了，又是耀羣取下了聽筒；</p>
<p>「日本話」。她失意地瞧着我。</p>
<p>鶴見接過了聽筒，給耀羣點了頭，點得那麼低，好像鞠躬一樣，嘴裏還要連聲「謝謝」。</p>
<p>「您大家猜是誰來的電話？」鶴見接完電話，掛上了聽筒，轉身來問我們。他接話的時候，只哼了幾個「好」字，是日本語。要想猜測，毫無根據，頗不容易。</p>
<p>「松井？」我從日本語上　想。</p>
<p>鶴見哈哈大笑起來，笑得那麼天真。</p>
<p>「呌您真猜不着，是我們的「老四」。他也　到駐軍支部裏去了；要求他們軍部也派人一路去追尋奧先生。這一着我認為辦得太好了，我剛才簡直想不到」。所說「老四」，即「〇四」號。</p>

<h3>光榮歸於人類　愛迪生百歲誕辰紀念</h3>
<p>— ·心·耳</p>
<p>一八六一年四月十二日，美國爆發了一次內戰：著名的南北美之戰。那時愛迭生正十四歲，這位少年愛迭生，在美國內戰進行得如火如茶的時候，獨力刋行一張小型報紙，公開在火車上發售。</p>
<p>那時全美的人口不足三千萬，那時美國總統是林肯林肯領導着美國前進，開拓了一個世界空前的政治局面。南北美戰爭的政治口號是解放黑奴，而實際的意義是現代美國的抬頭。這次內戰的結束，使美國在社會制度和生產組織中完成了一種革命運動。工業生產的迅速發展，遂使這位少年愛迭生踏上一條光輝燦爛的道路。</p>
<p>歷史家往往說：南北美戰爭產生了英雄林肯。却很少有人說：產生了愛迭生。</p>
<p>在近代史中，我們幾乎可以不提任何一個政治家，却不能不提瓦特和愛迭生。瓦特的蒸汽機排斥了手工業，引起了社會的革新運動，而愛迭生的一千一百五十一種發明，却促成了各種各樣的新興工業，使世界的工業時代的文化急速發展。比較起來，愛迭生對於人類生活水準的提高，有了最豐富的供獻。</p>
<p>「愛迪生與人們走同一條路。但是結果呢，她走到別人所不能到的處女地。」</p>
<p>南北之戰產生了許多發戰爭財的百萬金元富翁，這些富翁在戰後投資於工業。同時西部開始開發。一頁愛迭生的年譜，幾乎可以等於一部近代美國富强史。縱然愛迭生的發明品成為少數人的發財工具，但愛迭生的光輝永遠不可磨滅。</p>
<p>愛迭生產生在一個廣大的背景上，他在牛頓時代的物理原則上開出了奇葩，以美國的立場看，固然是美國的光榮，但也是全人類的光榮。</p>
<p>我相信每一個讀者一定瞭解：一個破碎的中國，科學家決不可能在任何物理原則上獲得重大的成就。</p>

<h3>電碼新編</h3>
<p>— 一丁</p>
<p>因為工作的關係，每天總要翻一次以上「電碼書」，每翻一次，頭痛得很。</p>
<p>首先，我懷疑這本漢文電報工具書最初編製，對於字的選擇，是出自幾個人主觀的擬定，抑或是由許多電報稿作歸納的統計，才獲到最常用字的字彙。擺在我們眼前：大概有四分之一的僻字，怪字，破體字，變體字，……混在「7902」以前的正編，（例如「1427」的「朶」，「0027」的「、」，或「0054」的「亅」……）而相反的許多最常用字却放在「8001」以後的「補遺」，和「9687」以後的「補遺之補遺」（例如「8082」的「偷」，「8705」的「煙」……），難道「偷」字比不上「朶」字的常用麽？難道「、」或「亅」比「煙」字更常用麽？</p>
<p>漢文部首檢字法雖然有先天的缺點，但部首排列上，却並不一定要墨守「康熙字典」的「不成文法」，而儘可以把有關的相近似的部首排在一起。比方說：四畫部首吧，「心」「毛」「爪」和「父」「母」就可以連成一串，六畫部首的「行」「竹」「　」「舛」也可以儘量靠攏。這不是比現在的够「有機」一些麽？</p>
<p>說起「電嗎書」，我們總想到「韻目代日序」的三十個詩韻韻目，例如「東」代表「一日」，「冬」代表「二日」。這方法雖比原字省一些，但依然笨得很，也不易記憶。近年頒定以「99××」代表日序，（如「9915」代表「十五日」）確是進步得多，與比相倣的尚有「98××」代表時間（如「9814」代表「下午二時」），都是很好的活辦法。不過我們還感到不够，例如每年十二個月的「月序」，至今在公文電報上例用「十二地支」即「十二時辰」來依次代替（例如「寅」代表「三月」），既不好記憶，用起來要細數一番，而普通的電報書裏既未列入，這當用通例似亦尚欠「立法手續」。</p>
<p>近代人生活愈來愈緊張了。從前說「卯時升堂」，現在非說「上午八時正上班」不可了。事實上，由兩小時作一單位雖縮成一小時，但猶未為足，我們不是當在新聞電報上看到這種語句麽：「歷時三十九分鐘完畢」「十時五十五分起航」……？像這些數字，我們很希望也弄一　像「99××」和「98××」般易記易用的數碼來代表。或者規定一「語首」，其後的四位數字代表「時」與「分」，例如「1431」代表「下午二時三十一分」。</p>
<p>前次報業同人要求交通部减低新聞電報報費時，曾一併提到編輯「新聞電略語彙」這一點，我們急切需要遵個語彙，同時也希望乘機將現行的「電碼新編」澈底修正一次。</p>

<p>在學校裏愛迪生被教師罵為糊塗蟲，市鎮上的醫生武斷他正患着腦病。只有他的母親發現了他的天才，由她自己來教育他，還不滿十二歲，愛氏已讀完了吉朋的「羅馬之　亡」，休謨的「英國史」。巴頓的「憂鬰之解剖」，及「科學　典」等巨著了。</p>
<p>第一本啓導愛迪生研究科學的書籍是伯加著的物理學。</p>
<p>愛迪生一生由最得意的發明是留聲機。他在發明以後，又化了十年功夫去研究改良，他學習起曲　來，研究人類的聲音，又調查了各種管弦樂的效果，作用與界限。並且顧了許多音樂師來聽他們奏音樂。十年中他層聽的音樂，不下兩萬五千種，他都一一收到留聲機中去，他的實騐室中，是世界上最完美的「音樂圖書館」。</p>
<p>愛迪生用留聲機從人們的耳朶裏去安慰他們的心，又發明了電影，從人們的眼睛裏，使人們的心靈快樂。</p>
<p>一九三一年二月十一日，愛迪生夫婦舉行八十四歲誕辰大典，並參加加路沙哈支河愛迪生大橋開幕禮。當新聞記者詢問他「人生成功的要素是什麽？」的時候，這位慈祥的老人說着</p>
<p>「野心和志願工作。」</p>
<p>「什麽是天才？」</p>
<p>愛迪生說：</p>

<h3>National Army Begins Large-Scale Sweep on Both Sides of Dangshan-Shangqiu Railway, Part of Communist Army Near Linyi Captured</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army is now launching a large-scale sweep of Liu Bocheng's forces who are roaming between Jieshan and on both sides of the Longhai Railway in Shangqiu. According to preliminary reports, about 5,000 members of Liu's forces have been eliminated in Zhouzhai, north of Dangshan, and Huizheji, south of Shangqiu. Liu's forces are showing a trend of being forced to flee back to western Shandong.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Bengbu, 10th] The main force of Liu Bocheng's army has been defeated north of Hao County. The remaining troops, about 10,000 strong, crossed the Longhai Railway northwest of Shangqiu and fled north. Wei Fenglou's 10,000 troops still occupy Hao County.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 10th] The communist troops who crossed the Longhai Railway and fled south in eastern Henan are being encircled and monitored by the National Army, and they are in a situation of being annihilated individually. Since the National Army's powerful forces moved into Shangqiu, an indestructible barrier will be formed on the Longhai route, cutting off contact between the communist troops fleeing south and those in western Shandong. Their Third Column attempted to flee north from near Xiaoba on the 9th, but was intercepted and forced to retreat by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th] The Longhai Railway east of Zhengzhou Station is currently only accessible to Yejigang in Minquan West. Huang Shousong, Deputy Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, said after returning to Zhengzhou from an inspection in Minquan on the 10th that the fighting in Minquan was quite fierce.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 10th] Since the National Army moved into Laiwu and Xintai, the communist troops in Tai'an have been extremely panicked. They suddenly destroyed the Lizhu Church outside the West Gate of Tai'an the day before yesterday and burned the Catholic Church in the city. They have also been burying landmines on the Tai'an Railway Station and the Tai-Lai Highway for days, and requisitioning a large number of civilians to completely destroy the section of the Tai-Xin Highway from Tai'an to Cuijiajia Village.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 10th] The National Army, which recaptured Xintai, was engaged in sweeping operations in the suburbs and foreign areas on the 9th and 10th. The remnants of the communist army's 4th Division, which retreated westward from the city on the evening of the 8th, counterattacked the northwestern outskirts of the city after reinforcement on the morning of the 9th, but were repelled by the National Army. In addition, the National Army advancing towards Mengyin has also reached the area five kilometers east of the city. Within a ten-kilometer diameter around the city, no trace of the communist army has been found after two days of clearing by the National Army. The National Army is currently not only rushing to repair the highway from Xieshan to Xintai, but also strengthening the fortifications on both sides, so that this more than 100-kilometer-long communication line deep into the mountains can be ensured to be safe.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 9th] The National Army, advancing south from Zhai in Mengyin, took advantage of the victory and broke into Xintai City on the 8th. After clearing the battlefield, on the morning of the 9th, in addition to continuing to advance towards Mengyin along the highway with a part of its forces, it also used a part of its forces to intercept the communist army coming to reinforce from Sishui and Tai'an five kilometers north of the city. As of noon on the 9th, the two sides were still in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 9th] The National Army, advancing north from Tancheng in southern Shandong, had crossed Mazhan and approached Lijiazhuang by noon on the 9th. Liu Bocheng's communist troops in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan are still dividing into several small groups between Hao County and Shangqiu, harassing everywhere. The National Army is encircling and pursuing them separately.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 10th] The National Army in southern Shandong continued to advance north on the 10th and stationed near Huabu, Lijiazhuang, south of Linyi at noon, capturing and executing part of the communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 10th] The main force of the communist army on the outskirts of Jinan has transferred part of its troops to southern Shandong and concentrated some in Guangrao and Shouguang, attempting to attack the middle section of the Jiaoji Railway and threaten the flanks of the National Army advancing south from central and southern Shandong. On the Jiaodong front, more than 10,000 communist troops also crossed the railway and marched south on the evening of the 8th. The communist troops near Jimo on the outskirts of Qingdao have now gathered to more than 10,000 people, attempting to advance into Jimo and cut off the railway between Chengyang and Nanquan. Therefore, general observations suggest that the pressure exerted by the communist army on the outskirts of Qingdao has not diminished, while the situation on the outskirts of Jinan has tended to ease.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 9th] The communist army's 7th and 9th Divisions, entrenched in Yucheng and Jiyang, crossed the Xiaoqing River east on the evening of the 7th, attempting to harass Zhangdian, Changshan, and Hucun, cut off the Jiaoji Railway, and threaten the flanks of the National Army advancing south. The National Army has been strictly on guard, and the safety of the rear can be ensured.</p>
<h3>Communist Troops Harass Outer Areas of Beiping, Invade Tong County Yesterday Morning But Were Repelled, Guxingyuan Convenes Meeting to Discuss Ensuring Security</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] Tong County City and the two railway stations east and west of Beiping were besieged at zero o'clock on the morning of the 10th by more than 3,000 communist troops who had sneaked in from Xianghe. Because the defending forces were only a security squadron, the West Railway Station was captured and completely burned. A part of the communist army broke into the North Gate of the county seat, and parts of the county government, the Youth League Headquarters, and the Beiping Tram Company's power plant were burned down. The defending forces concentrated on the ancient pagoda in the city, and from the high ground, they killed more than 300 communist troops. Armored vehicles arrived at dawn and shelled the two railway stations, and the communist army retreated at 7 o'clock. The communist troops in the city retreated at the same time. As of the evening, the two armies were still fighting fiercely near the No. 1 Shuangqiao Station of the Beiping Broadcasting Station between Beiping and Tong County. The broadcasting station has stopped broadcasting today due to power outage. Only a small part of the Beiping tram is in operation. Trains and telecommunications to Tong County have been interrupted all day. At the same time, the Niulanshan and Zhangxin railway stations of the Ping-Gu Railway also suffered a feint attack by the communist army, which retreated shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beigu, 10th] The foreign countries outside Beiping are nervous. The communist army besieged the Shahe Railway Station of the Ping-Sui Railway last night, and two groups broke into Shahe Town, set fires, and then retreated. The various military outposts of the National Army along the Nai Zifang and Sun River in northern Beiping are constantly being attacked by the communist army. The Daxing County Government has implemented a curfew throughout the county starting at 7:00 a.m. on the 10th. There are more than 1,000 communist troops active between Weishanzhuang and Lixian Town in southern Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] The Beiping Pacification Headquarters convened a meeting of military leaders in Beiping on the afternoon of the 10th to discuss the security of the outer areas of Beiping in response to the attack on Tong County.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] Zhou Kefeng, the magistrate of Tong County, is missing due to the communist attack. The prison was robbed, and all the prisoners escaped. Forty trucks in Tong County were also driven away by the communist army. A dozen station employees were captured, and daring people escaped and returned.</p>
<h3>Tight Encirclement of Baoding's Outer Areas, Garrison Forces Implement Alert</h3>
<p>Song Kentang Goes to Bao to Command Military Affairs</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 10th] The outer areas of Bao are still tense. The communist army failed to attack Nandaran and attempted to attack the railway station again. Song Kentang, Chief of Staff of the 11th War Zone, went to Bao by special train on the morning of the 10th to command. All civil servants of Hebei Province have been undergoing military training since the 10th. In order to prevent the communist army from mingling with the city gates of Bao, five military-civilian cooperation stations have been set up to unify defense.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Military news: The communist army's Nie Rongzhen's First, Second, Third, and Fourth Columns, about 100,000 people, have been frequently moving around Baoding for days, spying on the city walls. Bao Zibin, the garrison commander of Baoding, has personally led his staff to implement vigilance since the 4th of this month, and the city defense of Bao has become more consolidated. In addition, the communist army between Gaobeidian and Baoding is still three columns, including nine brigades, of Nie Rongzhen's troops, and there has been no contact with the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 10th] The passenger train from Ping to Bao on the 8th derailed 112 kilometers north of Gucheng and was not repaired until 9:00 p.m., a delay of six hours. In addition, the Ping-Bao passenger train has been shortened by two hours since the 9th. Train No. 4412 will depart from Bao at 10:00 a.m. every morning.</p>
<h3>Communist Personnel of Military Mediation Department Scheduled to Leave Beiping Today</h3>

<h3>Legislators Suggest That the Executive Yuan Should Nationalize Gold, Proposal to Be Discussed at Legislative Yuan General Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 10th] Legislators Lou Tongsun and Jian Guansan, in view of the recent fluctuations in the gold market affecting the entire financial situation, suggested that the Executive Yuan should nationalize gold. If this cannot be done, please stop gold trading. It is reported that this case will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan General Assembly on the 14th.</p>

<h3>Gold, Banknotes, and Commodity Prices Rise Sharply in Various Places, Tianjin, Hankou, and Kunming Adopt Measures to Suppress Them</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] Tianjin has taken emergency measures since the 5th to ban the black market in gold and U.S. dollars and prohibit food speculation. However, the runaway prices have not yet been completely curbed. The municipal government has now received an order from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters to hand over illegal merchants to the Garrison Headquarters and punish them in accordance with the emergency measures in times of emergency. Mayor Du Jianshi inspected the gold, banknotes, and food markets on the morning of the 10th and instructed merchants to assist the government in stabilizing prices and not to test the law.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] After Mayor She Jianzhi personally inspected the food market on the morning of the 10th, food prices in Tianjin have generally fallen on the afternoon of the 10th. A large bag of American flour has fallen by 3,000 to 7,000 yuan per bag, corn has fallen by 800 yuan per 100 jin, wheat has fallen by 500 yuan per 100 jin, beans have fallen by 3,500 yuan per 100 jin, and sorghum has fallen by 4,000 yuan per 100 jin.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Fuzhou, 10th] Commodity prices in Rong have risen sharply in a whirlwind. U.S. dollars are 14,000 yuan, gold prices are 740,000 yuan, and rice has jumped out of the 160,000 yuan mark. The market situation is chaotic. Although the authorities are determined to stabilize prices by selling flat-rate rice, the quantity is small and the effect is negligible.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] Commodity prices here have risen sharply in recent days, especially food prices. The Provincial Council asked the Provincial Government to take measures and convened a symposium today, deciding to borrow food from the Bank of China, sell it at flat rates to public educators and students, and send money to the food production areas to purchase food and implement flat-rate sales.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 10th] Commodity prices in Taiwan Province continue to rise. Gold ornaments cost 1.2 times more per tael, and the market price is 38,000 yuan, which is 1.33 million legal tender based on the official exchange rate of 1 to 35 between Taiwan and Shanghai. U.S. dollars cost 500 yuan, which is 17,500 legal tender. The black market exchange rate between Taiwan and Shanghai has fallen again, and today it is 1 to 23. The Food Bureau continues to sell flat-rate rice at 22.2 yuan per catty, but the black market is thriving, and rice prices are still hovering above 24 yuan. Food merchants dare not lower rice prices, apparently still hoarding. Official regulations require food merchants to sell all their hoarded goods in four phases, but this has not been seen.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kunming, 10th] Kunming City was stimulated by the skyrocketing gold prices and chips this week (3rd to 8th), and commodity prices changed with time. The entire market was in a chaotic state, and there was an unreasonable phenomenon: the price of gold in Kunming was more than 100,000 yuan higher per tael than in Shanghai. Provincial Chairman Yu Hanzeng once summoned Li Zhuo'an, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to inquire about the reasons for the skyrocketing gold prices in order to seek stability.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] Due to recent financial fluctuations and soaring gasoline prices, Guangzhou Public Transportation has suspended 90 buses on the 9th due to excessive losses, and another part will be suspended on the 10th. Currently, only 100 buses are available in the city (less than one-third of the original total), which is far from meeting the needs, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. Military and business officials said that if the government does not allow price increases and does not find a way to solve the gasoline problem, all buses will be suspended within days. (More news on gold market movements and price suppression can be found on pages 5 and 9)</p>

<h3>China Trust Bureau Distributes 500 Boxes of Rayon Yesterday</h3>
<p>(From our City News) The China Trust Bureau distributed more than 500 boxes of rayon to various factories yesterday, with the price still being 2.8 million.

It has never distributed rayon to merchants to avoid raising prices. The bureau currently has enough inventory to continuously distribute to various factories.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Forest Railway Dug Up and Transported Away</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The northeastern forest area is vast and the logging is endless. It has always been known to the world as the land of forest sea. During the enemy and puppet period, in order to facilitate the convenience of logging and transportation, forest railways were laid in the central and northern forest areas of the Northeast, with a total length of 1,676 kilometers, including 21 narrow-gauge lines with a length of 1,260 kilometers, 6 broad-gauge lines with a length of 416 kilometers, and 264 German-made locomotives and 1,0114 combined vehicles. After the restoration, most of them were moved away by the Soviet army, leaving very little. According to those who escaped from the northern communist area, the remaining road rails were dug up last summer and all transported to a certain place for the purpose of opening up forests. This is a fatal blow to the development of northeastern forests in the future.</p>

<p>[Our News] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held its second meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 10th on the third floor of the Central Bank.

The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. Regarding the recent announcement issued by the U.S. Consul General that import taxes will be increased to counteract China's export subsidies, it is reported that this is a routine matter for the consulate and not a policy decision of the U.S. government towards China. Currently, U.S. Consul General Weituo is requesting instructions from the U.S. State Department in Washington. It is reported that a favorable reply to our country can be obtained soon.</p>
<p>In addition, the reporter inquired with U.S. Consul General Davis in this city about the truth of the matter and whether our country could obtain exceptional treatment.

<h3>Work of Receiving Dalian is in Progress</h3>
<p>Military Authorities Deny Advancing Towards Dalian</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Jinyang, 10th] Huang Guangdou, Secretary-General of the Dalian Municipal Government, said that the preparatory work for the reception of Dalian is in active progress. Recently, it will recruit former Dalian policemen or Northeastern youths to train for more than three months at the 6th Police School in order to receive the city. As for the future unified reception of Dalian, both Nanjing and Shenyang are discussing with various agencies to avoid confusion and disputes.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 10th] Military authorities here stated that no order to advance towards Dalian has been issued.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 10th] The National Army on the front line in Pulandian is still in its original position. Gong Xuesui telegraphed here saying that the reception of Dalian is waiting for the opportunity. He himself cannot come to the Northeast in the short term, and the foreign reports are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 10th] The Soviet army stationed north of the Xie Ding Xian in Shihe has not yet withdrawn. Xizidian, southwest of Piziwo, is the water source of Dalian and is still outside the Xie Ding Xian and is also stationed with Soviet troops. Generally, people say that this is actually convenient for the chaos caused by the communist army south of Pulandian. According to Jiang Tian, a communist army squad leader who surrendered to the National Army, the communist army south of Pulandian is quite scorned by the Soviet army.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Sichuan-Kang Defense, Zhang Qun Presides Over Pacification Conference in Chengdu</h3>

<h3>Northeastern Communist Army Transportation is on the Eve of Collapse, Railway Employees Flee to National Army Area</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] Railway employees in the northeastern communist-occupied area have fled into the National Army area one after another. Zhang Lianju, the general affairs officer of the Qian Gorlos Banner Station, and Gu Shijie, the stationmaster of the Baichengzi Station, and 15 other people fled to Nong'an in groups. It is reported that the railway in the communist area lacks the necessary materials, and the supply has been cut off. The number of locomotives is decreasing day by day due to insufficient parts. All bridges on the railway are buried with explosives, ready to be destroyed when retreating. The treatment of railway employees is extremely harsh, with no wages or body protection. At present, the transportation in the northeastern communist area can be said to be on the eve of total collapse.</p>
<h3>Taipingshao in Liaodong Recovered</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 10th] The National Army in Liaodong recovered Taipingshao on the morning of the 5th. The main force of the communist army's 11th Brigade and the 10th Brigade fled to the vicinity of Huanren (Note: Taipingshao was invaded by the communist army on the 31st of last month). On the 6th, they gathered the remnants of their troops and attempted to attack Huanren but were repelled.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in Southern Shandong Issues Large Denomination Banknotes Again</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nantong, 10th] In order to disrupt the national finance, the communist army once abused the issuance of a large number of anti-currency banknotes. Recently, it has manufactured a large number of 2,000-yuan face value banknotes in southern Shandong. The banknotes were printed by the Central Printing Factory in 1945 and are cyan in color. These counterfeit banknotes have been discovered in the Donghai area. Except for the slightly inferior paper quality, they are almost indistinguishable. The authorities in northern Jiangsu are closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<h3>Taiyuan Military Authorities Refute Yan'an Broadcasting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th] According to the military authorities here, Yan'an has been broadcasting for days that the communist army invaded the territory of Dingxiang County on January 29, and annihilated and captured more than 500 National Army security deputy regimental commanders and below in Lingshi on the 30th (later changed to more than 990 people), and captured more than 2,000 National Army regimental commanders and above in Wenshui, which is purely fabricated. Dingxiang was peaceful and uneventful last month, and the county territory has always been in the hands of the National Army, so the so-called capture of so many National Army troops is even more absurd. In the battle of Lingshi, the National Army had a direct contact with the invading communist army as a company, and Wenshui City also had only three companies, so how could there be hundreds or thousands of National Army troops captured by them? In fact, most of the soldiers also broke through and returned to their units.</p>

(Note: There are 52 new legislators, 25 supervisors, and 44 political councilors.) (2) Regarding the issue of the number of standing committee members of the Kuomintang Selection and Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, it was decided that the Kuomintang and social elites should jointly occupy three-quarters, totaling 93 members. (Note: There are a total of 125 standing committee members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, and the remaining one-quarter, namely 32 members, will be elected by the Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Central Standing Committee today approved the principles for the allocation of seats for Kuomintang members and non-party members as standing committee members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, and for the newly added legislators, supervisors, and political councilors.

<h3>People's Socialist Party Candidates for Government Participation: Decision Expected at this Week's Standing Committee Meeting; Zuo Shunsheng Denies Submitting List</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The People's Socialist Party's list of candidates for participation in the government and the selection of delegates to go to Beijing are currently in the stage of exchanging views, and a decision is expected at this week's standing committee meeting. According to a senior member of the party who told reporters: Mr. Zhang Junmai, as a senator, cannot participate in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan after the reorganization. There are two opinions within the party regarding participation in the government. One is to participate in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan to engage in constitutional work, but not to participate in administrative agencies, because the current war has prolonged, and the economy has declined. If the People's Socialist Party fully participates in the government, it will not help the current difficulties and will be jointly responsible. This is what Mr. Zhang Junmai advocates. The other faction advocates that if we don't participate, we don't participate. If we want to participate, we must participate fully, obtain a portion of power, and take actual responsibility. The current reorganization of the government is in fact a kind of "expansion." Based on the current situation, it is speculated that the participation of the People's Socialist Party in the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan may only be the first step in participating in the government. After the Third Plenary Session, some people within the People's Socialist Party may believe that the government has high sincerity in ending political tutelage and demand full participation.</p>
<p>[Our Report from Nanjing, 10th] Zuo Shunsheng returned to Beijing at 2 PM on the 10th. Regarding the list of names for participation in the government and legislative and supervisory committees, Zuo firmly stated that he had not made this preparation. The rumor that he brought a list is not accurate. However, he said that the Young China Party's principle of participating in the reorganized government has long been determined and has not changed. Zuo will not leave Beijing for the time being. Chen Qitian went to Shanghai at 3 PM on the 10th to attend the Young China Party's weekly meeting.</p>

It is heard that the British side still hopes that the steamships of Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire can sail on our inland rivers, but this request will inevitably be difficult for us to accept.

<h3>National Government Commends Song Chunting</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Government ordered: Song Chunting joined the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League) in his early years and ran around for the revolution, not avoiding difficulties and dangers.

His ambition was not fulfilled, and he was killed halfway. Recalling the past deeds, we deeply regret his loss. He should be commended by explicit order to recognize his past achievements.</p>

Bi Zeyu received reporters this afternoon and said that the election was extremely legal and explained his ambitions after being elected. The election supervisor, Shang Chuan Dao, said afterward that he believed that the candidates who withdrew lacked democratic demeanor.</p>

People in the judicial circles here believe that this order from the central government is actually a supplement to the amnesty order and can be called benevolent governance.</p>
<h3>The Wreckage of a Missing Aircraft on the Guangzhou-Chongqing Route of China National Aviation Corporation Was Found on a Mountain in Guizhou Province. A Ground Search Team Will Go to Investigate the Truth Today.</h3>
<p>[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation's Guangzhou-Chongqing Flight 138 went missing on the way to Chongqing on the 26th of last month in the area where Sichuan and Guizhou provinces meet. After the company authorities sent a plane to search for it, the wreckage of a destroyed aircraft was found on a high mountain between Zunyi and Tongzi in Guizhou Province, but because the deep mountains were shrouded in clouds and fog, it was not possible to determine whether it was Flight 138. The Chongqing branch of China National Aviation Corporation has organized a ground search team, which will depart for the Guizhou border today to search for the wrecked aircraft. The mission of this ground search team will be one of the most difficult and arduous in history, because the aircraft is far away on a barren mountain 6,000 feet above sea level, a place rarely visited by people. The search team will first advance along the Chongqing-Guiyang Highway, and then turn into no man's land led by orientation personnel. It is estimated that if there are no other unexpected obstacles on the road, it will take at least two days to reach the location of the destroyed aircraft. The search team will carry enough tools, food, etc. The number of people is ten, in addition to technical personnel, it is said that there are also several family members of the passengers on the plane.</p>

<h3>Original Reason for Ding Ni Mo's Judgment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Ding Mocun was sentenced to death by the Capital High Court on the 8th. Due to the significance of Ding's case, the High Court took great care in preparing the judgment. The original reasons for the judgment are published below:</p>
<p>Regarding the False Positions Held</p>
<p>The defendant in this case, Ding Mocun, served as the director of the Special Operations Headquarters, a representative of the National Congress, a standing member of the Central Executive Committee of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Social Affairs of the Central Party Headquarters of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Social Affairs of the Puppet Executive Yuan, a member of the Central Political Committee of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Transportation of the Puppet Government, the Minister of Social Welfare of the Puppet Government, the Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council of the Puppet Government, the Deputy Director of the Political Security Department of the Puppet Government, and the Governor of Zhejiang Province concurrently as the Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters of the Puppet Government, the Director of Pacification in Hangzhou of the Puppet Government, and the Commander of the Provincial Security of the Puppet Government. During the investigation and trial, he repeatedly admitted these facts without denial. These admissions are consistent with the defendant's statements in the interrogation records of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the former Military Affairs Commission, as well as the defendant's confession. Furthermore, the public gazettes of the Puppet Executive Yuan (issues 62 to 70, which contain records of the defendant attending various meetings in his capacity as a puppet minister) can be used as evidence. The fact that the defendant participated in the puppet organization is extremely clear.</p>
<p>Killing Yu Hua</p>
<p>After the fall of Beijing and Shanghai, due to the concession system, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai was still able to exercise its functions. The Puppet Special Operations Headquarters, because the staff of the court were loyal to the party and the country, enforced the law impartially, were unwilling to participate in the "peace movement," and were an obstacle to its work, secretly dispatched operatives at approximately 8:00 AM on November 23rd of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), ambushing them in front of the residence of Yu Hua, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the court, at 202 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. They shot and killed him as he was on his way to the court to work, as a warning. Not only did the victim's wife, Yu Chenyin, provide a vivid description of the events, but the court also secretly submitted a report to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Furthermore, there are records in telegrams No. 5349 and No. 5350 dated November 29th of the same year (found in the administrative files of the former Shanghai Jiangsu High Court Second Branch), as well as in the Sino-American-Japanese Daily News dated February 30th of the same year (found on page 11 of Yu Chenyin's scrapbook) and the Pearl River Daily News dated March 20th of the 29th year of the Republic (found on page 19 of the aforementioned scrapbook), and the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily News dated March 24th of the same year (found on page 18 of the aforementioned scrapbook), which can be used as evidence.</p>
<p>The Zheng Pingru Case</p>
<p>Zheng Pingru was the daughter of Zheng Yue, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), she joined the Investigation and Statistics Office of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. In the spring of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), the office secretly dispatched her to infiltrate the Special Operations Headquarters, instructing her to seize opportunities to sanction the rebels. Zheng Pingru used her teacher-student relationship with Ding Mocun to feign closeness. Therefore, at 5:00 PM on February 21st of the same year, she also used the excuse of buying a coat to lure Ding Mocun to the Siberia Fur Store at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road. The operatives who were ambushed there opened fire, but the plot failed because the defendant was alert. Zheng Pingru was arrested by the Puppet Special Operations Headquarters on the 26th of the same month and executed shortly afterward. The details of this attack have been clearly testified to by the victim's brother, Zheng Huajun, and the witness Pan Sansheng (see the interrogation record entrusted by the Shanghai High Court on December 11th, 1946). The content of the public letter No. 5167 of the "Three-Five-Nine" Directive dated December 9th, 1946, from the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang is consistent with this, and can be considered true.</p>
<p>Killing Patriots</p>
<p>Xu Ke, a member of the First Intelligence Group of the underground workers of the Shanghai District of the former Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau, was shot and killed in Shanghai on May 24th of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). Li Chuchen, the leader of the Fifth Intelligence Group, was arrested for failing to sanction Ding Mocun and Li Shiqun in Shanghai and was killed on February 25th of the same year. Chen Zhaoqing, a member of the Fifth Intelligence Group, was arrested for failing to sanction Li Shiqun and was killed on February 25th of the same year. Xu Shouxin, a telegraph inspector, was killed on March 27th of the same year for communicating with the Central Government. Yu Yanzhi, the captain of the Fifth Action Team, was killed on December 27th of the same year for hiding military supplies. Zhou Xiliang, a communicator, was executed on December 27th of the same year for stealing important documents. Xu A'mei, a direct communicator, was also executed in December of the same year. Peng Furong was arrested for carrying out an action case in Shanghai and was killed on April 13th of the same year. All eight of the above were arrested and killed by the Puppet Special Operations Headquarters, as evidenced by the telegram No. 4731 from the former National Government Military Affairs Commission's Investigation and Statistics Bureau on October 22nd, 1946. The above-mentioned deceased Central Government personnel were all brutally murdered during the defendant's tenure as the director of the Special Operations Headquarters, and the defendant must bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>Acts and Words of Collusion with the Enemy</p>
<p>The Puppet Central Political Committee was the highest organ of the puppet organization. All puppet national policies related to politics, economy, diplomacy, and military affairs were decided by the committee. The defendant was appointed as a member of the committee by the traitor Wang Zhaoming at the beginning of its establishment and remained in office until the victory. The defendant served on the committee for many years and, as he himself admitted, should be jointly responsible for all decisions of the committee. Although the defendant claimed to "not remember," "not participate in," or "oppose" various important proposals of the committee, such as the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Alliance Treaty, and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States, these are clearly evasive words and it is difficult to accept his empty words of denial. Furthermore, during his tenure as the Minister of Social Welfare of the Puppet Government, the defendant published an article entitled "New Year's Sentiments" (see page 35 of the New Year's Special Edition of the Puppet Central Daily News published by the Puppet Central Daily News Agency in February 1944), advocating that "only with the victory of the Greater East Asia War can the East Asian nations be liberated." He exaggerated the war power of the Japanese invaders, promoted military build-up, and intensified the training of young people, attempting to fight alongside the enemy to defeat Britain and the United States in order to realize Greater East Asiaism. His collusion with the enemy and treasonous intentions are evident and cannot be concealed. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Editorial: Political Factors in the Gold Rush</h3>
<p>The gold and currency surge has suddenly become frenzied since the Lunar New Year. Yesterday, the price of gold knocked on the door of seven million, and the black market price of US dollars also rose to thirteen thousand yuan, and there was no price for the market, the situation is extremely chaotic, and people are panicking; because the rise in the price of gold will inevitably involve the rise in general prices, making industry and commerce shrink, and people's livelihood is more difficult. Regarding the emergence of this trend, this newspaper has written articles to expound its views, believing that the people should have a healthy mentality and the government should clarify and implement firm policies. At that time, the price of gold was still hovering around 4.8 million, but only five days later, the price of gold soared to knock on the door of seven million, only a few short days away from 396.5 on February 1st, and the price of gold has risen by about 76%; the madness of the surge can be imagined. The reason why the current gold price surge is so crazy is that speculation is certainly an important factor, but there are also several points that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>First of all, what we want to point out is that the price of gold in Shanghai was originally lower than in Tianjin and North China. On February 1st, when the price of gold in Shanghai was still hovering around 396.5, the price of gold in Tianjin was already at 540.7, Beijing was at 52.5, and Xi'an was at 500.5. Among them, the price of gold in Taiyuan was the most expensive. Merchants can make huge profits by transporting gold from Shanghai to North China; and the reason why the price of gold in North China is more expensive than in Beijing and Shanghai, in addition to geographical factors, there must be other reasons. After "anti-currency" exchanged for goods in the "liberated areas," they then exchanged goods for legal currency and gold, thus raising the price of gold in North China. Merchants found it profitable, so they competed to transport gold north. A batch of gold recently seized by Tianjin Customs is a significant example of the northward transportation of gold. Therefore, the recent surge in gold prices in Shanghai seems to be not simply an economic problem, but there is still a great political effect here.</p>
<p>Fearing that China will not be chaotic and that China's economy will collapse, causing national unrest, is a consistent strategy of the Communist Party; this was also mentioned by Marshal Marshall, who regarded himself as a mediator, that a shortcut to promoting China's economic collapse is to raise prices, forcing industry and commerce to be unable to maintain and people unable to live. To achieve this goal, promoting a gold rush is the fastest means. Therefore, from the perspective of the Communist Party's consistent strategy of making China trend towards economic collapse, the current gold rush inevitably has the Communist Party playing a role. General speculative merchants are concerned about current interests, or have not thought that the storm-raising in the gold market, if it causes an economic panic and promotes economic collapse, will fall into the trap of the Communist Party. In the final analysis, if the economy really collapses and the Communist Party's strategy is completed, it will not be a beneficial thing for themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to appeal to the general people engaged in gold trading to put national interests first, and not just consider current temporary interests. If China's economy deteriorates again and becomes irreversible, the benefits that have been won now will inevitably be lost. They should understand that this is not a result they would like to see. We would like to reiterate our previous argument that we must establish our healthy mentality and rebuild our confidence in ourselves and our nation. For the sake of our nation's future, and also for the sake of our individual futures, we cannot allow our economic situation to deteriorate further: we must do our best to save all kinds of declining trends.</p>
<p>But here we must also point out the government's responsibility for the current gold rush. One of the immediate causes of the current gold rush is undoubtedly the issuance of large-denomination banknotes. The surge in gold prices is taking place after the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, and the causal relationship between them is self-evident. The issuance of large-denomination banknotes indicates that the government itself seems to have lost confidence in the banknotes it issues, which led to the rise in general prices. Speaking of its distant cause, it should be traced back to the past when gold savings were actually issued at a 60% discount. The government established gold savings in the hope of recalling legal currency; the people trusted the government, so they used their savings to buy gold, and at that time, the government also encouraged it in many ways. Who knew that the people handed over their hard-earned savings to the government; and when the government issued gold, it suddenly ordered a 60% discount. This shows that the government does not value its promises; instead, it is like a fraudulent means to defraud the people's savings. As a result, the people gradually lost trust in the government and dared not hand over their savings to the government again, so they competed to buy gold and US dollars, resulting in the situation today. The government itself should bear most of the responsibility for our economic and political situation reaching today's state. It is not that the people automatically lost faith in the government, but that the government's various measures forced the people to abandon their trust in the government. Therefore, in the current gold rush, the people should rebuild confidence, and the most important thing is how the government can gain the trust of the people. The government must first establish confidence, and then the people's trust in the government can be rebuilt. The government should quickly come up with a solution.</p>
<p>In short, the various phenomena in China's economic circles today cannot escape the political factors. The current economic decline in China is mainly due to the actions of the Communist Party. Because of the existence of the Communist Party's military and even economic struggles, the government has not been able to take thorough measures to improve our country's economic situation in the year or so after the victory. At the same time, all the government's measures may not achieve their expected goals. At the time of economic deterioration, we want to urge the government to take decisive measures to quickly prevent the further deterioration of the situation.</p>

<h3>Riot and Jailbreak by Prisoners in Shashi, 112 Fugitive Major Criminals</h3>
<p>Most are traitors and those sentenced to death or life imprisonment</p>
<p>[Report from Hankou by this newspaper] Regarding the jailbreak of more than 100 major criminals from the Shashi District Court Detention Center, the reporter recently met with someone from Shashi who spoke about the details of the jailbreak at the time, with many prominent points. Whether this case was a planned action by the criminals or a release by the guards, all parties are paying close attention. The content is briefly recorded as follows: It is said that the detention center of the court is located on Sanmin Street in Shashi. The director, Mr. Li, went to Hankou a month ago and has not returned. During this period, the main person in charge of the detention center was only a prison official and a security director. Whether the guard in the center was therefore negligent is questionable. At the same time, according to the guards of the detention center:</p>
<p>Before this case occurred, the prisoners in the first and second cells of the detention center often used</p>
<p>Japanese to communicate</p>
<p>The guards did not know Japanese, so they did not notice anything else. Until 11:35 PM on January 29th, all the staff of the detention center had gone to bed, and there were only three guards on night duty. Two of them were guarding the third prison, and the other was specially guarding inside the gate, on duty. While patrolling, the traitor Wang Shuyiao from the second cell,</p>
<p>Claimed to be thirsty</p>
<p>Requested the night watchman Wan Guohua to give him a bowl of cold water. Wan immediately agreed and handed the cold water through the wooden fence. After receiving the water, Wang suddenly grabbed Wan's hand and called another prisoner to strangle Wan's throat, making him unable to move. The bandit Nie Peng and others also immediately responded. For a time, dozens of prisoners worked together to dismantle the wooden pillars and</p>
<p>Swarmed out</p>
<p>First, they tied up the guard Wan, and then, led by the two criminals Wang Shuyiao and Nie Peng, tied up the two guards who were dozing off, seized two rifles from the soldiers, and forced them to hand over the keys. After opening the third cell, they rushed to the front staff dormitory, forcing the security director to open the prison gate, robbing a rifle from the guard, and tying up all the staff in the center and throwing them into the second wooden cell, covering them with quilts, so that no one dared to speak out. On the other hand, they forced the prisoners in the fourth and fifth cells to join them, and sent people to guard the front and back doors, not allowing them to be unlocked, waiting for them to remove their shackles. After more than an hour, the criminals began to free themselves from their shackles and prepared to escape collectively. Before leaving, the criminal Fang Chao and others</p>
<p>Advocated killing</p>
<p>The security director and the prison official, but were prevented by other criminals. Until 1:40 AM the next morning, they calmly opened the gate and escaped through Qingyun Pavilion and Ta'er Bridge towards Caoshi. This group of great traitors and villains was able to escape the law by force. According to a subsequent investigation, a total of 112 prisoners escaped from the detention center this time. Among them, those convicted of treason were the most numerous, accounting for more than 80% of the total. Those sentenced to death and life imprisonment also numbered nearly 30. It can be called an unprecedented jailbreak. It is also said that "there were a total of 175 prisoners in custody in the detention center, and 63 of them did not escape with them this time, all of whom had very light sentences, so they were unwilling to join in."</p>

<h3>Dredging the Minjiang River Channel, Jianxi Launches Large-Scale Blasting of Shoals</h3>
<p>[Report from Fuzhou by this newspaper] The Minjiang River is the largest river basin in Fujian Province and the lifeline of transportation in northeastern Fujian. The section of the Minjiang River from Shuikou to Nanping is called Jianxi, which is 89 kilometers long. The entire section is full of reefs and shoals, which greatly affects the safety of transportation. There are more than 20 dangerous shoals. In November last year, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau sent an engineering team to carry out construction and surveying, and in December, it jointly established a work-relief engineering office with the Min Office of the Provincial Government to select and carry out construction separately. The important shoals and stones that have been blasted are Tiger Mother Shoal and Longmai Shoal. The ones that are being planned to be blasted are Lotus Shoal, Broken Finger Shoal, Three Handles of Lotus, Scale Hook Shoal, Kirin Horn, Folded Paper Port, and Scissors Port. It is expected that the project will be completed before April this year, at which time water transportation from Nanping to Fuzhou will be convenient. In order to dredge the Jiang River waterway from Taijiang to Mawei in Fuzhou, so that giant ships of more than 1,000 tons can directly reach the Taijiang urban area and increase the convenience of navigation, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has requested the Provincial Construction Department to order a large dredging vessel from the United States. The Construction Department has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau's branch office to loan 1 billion yuan to order the vessel from the United States.</p>

<p>[Reuters, Rome, 9th Dispatch] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, in a talk with reporters today, stated that the strengthening of international relations must begin with neighboring countries, and one of our important neighbors is Great Britain. Great Britain has significant influence in the Mediterranean, therefore it is our neighbor. I deeply understand the importance of international cooperation and deeply resent the jealousy between countries. Only after international cooperation is established can war be sanctioned by the entire world. Regarding the Peace Treaty with Italy, Sforza stated that Italy's contribution to the Allied war effort seemed to have been completely disregarded, which is disappointing. He has protested to the Allied governments about this. Sforza concluded by saying that he has telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Bevin to explain the future relationship between the two countries. Italy knows that only in a peaceful framework can Italy have a chance to be reborn, and the basic condition is the restoration of traditional friendship between Great Britain and Italy.</p>

<h3>Palestine Conference on Verge of Collapse Again; Arabs Resolutely Oppose Judaization of Holy Land; Jewish Underground Party Will Continue Anti-British Efforts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 9th Dispatch] The London Palestine Conference is on the verge of collapse again. It is reported that the Arab representatives will submit a strongly worded note to the British side tomorrow, rejecting the British new proposal.

The committee enjoys semi-autonomous status under British trusteeship, and once the five-year trusteeship period expires, Palestine can gain complete independence. The above plan was originally intended to reconcile the differences between Arabs and Jews, but now it is difficult to please either side.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Cairo, 9th Dispatch] The Mufti of Jerusalem, Husseini, met with 250 Palestinian Arab soldiers today and addressed them, saying that if Britain insists on the Judaization of Palestine, then any attempt to resolve the issue of the Holy Land through conferences will be futile.

<h3>A Serious Report by the U.S. Government: An Analysis of Soviet Strength (Middle)</h3>
<p>Stalin Assumes Great Power in Raising the Quality of the Red Army</p>
<p>The organization and strength of the Red Army are kept highly secret. Although the Red Army suffered significant losses in the early stages of the German-Soviet war, they were still able to absorb a sufficient number of reinforcements to rebuild their peak strength, reaching approximately 20 million. This number has been reduced somewhat during postwar demobilization.</p>
<p>According to an Associated Press dispatch, a senior Allied officer stated on June 2, 1946, that the Soviet Union had 6 million armed personnel at that time and was preparing to reduce its army to a standing strength of 4.5 million.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the German-Soviet war, the Red Army's numerical advantage was partially offset by technical difficulties. It relied heavily on its historically renowned artillery to deter the German advance, giving the Soviet army the opportunity to train and equip sufficient tank forces.</p>
<p>During the war, although many of the most important industrial areas were occupied by the enemy, the Soviet Union was still able to provide adequate equipment to support its greatly expanded army. Most of this equipment relied on U.S. lend-lease materials.</p>
<p>The Red Army's training program is based on the assumption that future wars will be wars of machines and machines, requiring a large number of personnel trained in various military technologies. Marshal Stalin pointed out that trained personnel (i.e., those proficient in various specialized skills) are the decisive factor in all aspects. According to this instruction, the Red Army has established various schools to teach various military subjects.</p>
<p>Special political instructors often go deep into the front lines with the soldiers to explain recent important news, convey daily bulletins from the intelligence bureau, and make the soldiers familiar with the domestic and international situation. The Red Army also runs various research associations, teaching various industries and establishing many subjects.</p>
<p>Soviet Deputy Minister of Public Health Dr. Pliarov declared that the Red Army's medical achievements during World War II exceeded those of any participating country - the mortality rate in the Red Army's rear hospitals was only 1.1%, and 73% of wounded soldiers returned to the battlefield after treatment.</p>
<p>We do not know what materials Dr. Pliarov based this comparison on. The U.S. military is compiling mortality records in front and rear military hospitals during World War II. 73% of wounded U.S. Army soldiers returned to duty on the battlefield.</p>
<p>In recent years, a special class has emerged in the Soviet army. The Red Army is developing along a new path, very similar to the armies of old Russia and other capitalist countries. The line between soldiers and officers is becoming clearer every day. Following the rise of the Red Guards, an aristocratic military class has risen, enjoying special privileges and receiving salaries higher than those of other troops.</p>
<p>The Communist Party now controls the highest military organs. The leadership of the Party and the military are mixed together, making it difficult to distinguish them. However, above all, standing in the highest position is Stalin, and all leadership powers are concentrated in his person.</p>

<h3>Edison Centennial: Uranium Seemed to Have Been Used for Experiments Sixteen Years Ago</h3>
<p>[United Press, West Orange, New Jersey, 8th Dispatch] It has been discovered here that the great inventor Edison seemed to have used uranium for experiments sixteen years ago, as a test tube containing uranium nitrate was found in his desk. However, the purpose of Edison's experiment with this radioactive material is still unknown. Clues may be found in the large number of papers contained in his desk. Tuesday (the 11th) is Edison's centennial. The U.S. Navy revealed that during World War I, the U.S. Navy used 39 of Edison's inventions, including an aircraft direction finder, which the British army used in the war against Germany during World War II.</p>
<h3>British Government's Electricity Rationing Plan: Birmingham Refuses to Comply</h3>
<p>Fierce Debate to Unfold in the House of Commons</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] Hours before the British government's electricity rationing plan was scheduled to begin, the industrial city of Birmingham, deeming the government's plan impractical, decided not to comply. However, the city's 310,000 household users will automatically stop using electricity during the prescribed rationing hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily, based on their goodwill. Because the source of electricity for industrial and household use is the same, and industrial electricity has been decided to be supplied as usual, household electricity cannot be cut off separately. Some areas of London, due to the presence of major industries not subject to rationing, have also decided that household users will voluntarily stop using electricity. Cabinet members related to coal and electricity continued to discuss the matter today and study criticisms from various aspects. Officials from the Ministry of Fuel and Power were busy signing and replying to protests and inquiries from all over the country, and Shinwell himself did not leave his office from morning to night.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] The Battersea Power Station in London started today to have four people controlling electricity supply by moving the machinery to gradually reduce the amount of electricity supplied to each small station. Within half an hour, the hourly supply of 250,000 kilowatts of electricity was reduced to 100,000 kilowatts, and it is estimated that 135,000 pounds of coal can be saved per hour.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 10th Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to make a statement to the House of Commons today, explaining the electricity rationing measures that will take effect at midnight tonight. Churchill will personally attend the meeting at that time. Prior to that, the Conservative Party's leadership and its Fuel Committee will convene a special meeting. It is expected that the debate will unfold in a day or two.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th Dispatch] Scotland Yard received a telephone call from the southern end of London on Saturday, stating that a time bomb would explode at the residence of Fuel and Power Minister Shinwell this morning. After searching and preparing, the police found no incident occurred.</p>

<h3>Viet Minh's Attitude</h3>
<p>President Ho Chi Minh declares: If France cannot resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, the Viet Minh government will request arbitration from the United Nations…</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 9th] Due to the "iron curtain of press censorship" imposed by the French authorities in Saigon, our correspondent in Vietnam, Mr. Ganpeier, had to send a special messenger to deliver an important statement from President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic to our Singapore office for publication. Ho Chi Minh, from a location in Vietnam (the whereabouts of which are unknown to the French), wrote to Ganpeier stating that if France cannot resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, the Viet Minh government will request arbitration from the United Nations.</p>
<p>The French authorities impose military censorship on all telegrams sent abroad, which is somewhat reasonable, but the censorship is so strict that no journalist, even after paying the telegraph fees, knows the fate of their telegrams. The censorship authorities never notify the sender of any deletions or bans, a situation unprecedented in the world of censorship. (According to Ganpeier's report, our headquarters has already lodged a serious protest with the French government tonight regarding the newly implemented censorship system in Vietnam.) The following is the telegram sent by Ganpeier via special messenger to Singapore:</p>
<p>Saigon (delayed): Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh government, from a location near Hanoi, wrote to the reporter in response to several questions posed by the reporter. Ho Chi Minh stated that if France cannot resolve the current dispute through peaceful means, the Viet Minh is prepared to request arbitration from the United Nations. Other questions and answers are as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Under what conditions is the Viet Minh government prepared to cease hostilities and resume negotiations with the French government?</p>
<p>Answer: The only desire of the Viet Minh people is national unification (including Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin, where Annamese is spoken) and independence. We have no other demands. Once this goal is achieved, we are prepared to immediately cease hostilities and negotiate peace.</p>
<p>Question: If the French side cannot accept these conditions, what action will be taken?</p>
<p>Answer: If the French side cannot resolve the dispute peacefully, the Viet Minh government will request arbitration from the United Nations—perhaps the Four Powers would be best suited to undertake this task.</p>
<p>Question: What is the impact of the current war on the Vietnamese economy?</p>
<p>Answer: The national economy has been severely affected by the war. Production has sharply declined to one-tenth of its former level, coal production to one-fifth, and rice production to one-quarter. The number of civilians killed and towns destroyed by French bombing is impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>Question: Does the Viet Minh authorities provide adequate care for French people?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the treatment of these French people is far better than the treatment of the Viet Minh people under French rule. Many French people have written to thank us.</p>
<p>Ho Chi Minh continued: I wish to present the following facts to the reporters who have been deceived by French propaganda. The French claim that the Viet Minh is a tool of the Japanese is completely fabricated. Americans in Kunming, Yunnan, can attest to this, as these American friends were guests of our anti-Japanese guerrillas as late as the end of August 1945. They can tell the reporters the truth. The French also claim that the Viet Minh is a Communist Party. The full name of the Viet Minh is the Viet Minh Independence League. It is composed of various political parties, including the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, the Nationalist Party, the Marxist Party, and non-partisan organizations such as Catholics, Buddhists, Confucians, and landlords. Ninety percent of its members are participating in the struggle for independence based entirely on patriotic fervor. There are also members of various factions and non-partisans participating in the Viet Minh government, such as the Minister of the Interior, Huang Tao Kang, who is seventy years old and was exiled by the French to Poulo Condore for fourteen years. Our policies are by no means communist, nor even socialist.</p>
<p>Ho Chi Minh continued: The French also claim that this war was initiated by the Viet Minh. To clarify the truth, one must recall the French policies since March 6 of this year, such as the failure to implement the Franco-Vietnamese agreements, the large-scale terrorist activities in Cochinchina, the occupation of Ba Ninh in southern Annam, the blockade of Haiphong Harbor, the siege of Lang Son, the continuous increase of French troops, the daily acts of provocation by French soldiers, and the massacre and looting by French troops in Hanoi on December 17 of last year. I have appealed to the French government without receiving a response. Recently, Mr. Dupeyrat, who accompanied the French Minister of Colonies, Moutet, on a visit to Vietnam, wrote an article in "Le Figaro" in Paris. Although there are some errors, the true cause of the Vietnam incident can be gleaned from it. We know that the French have superior weapons, and regardless of the outcome of the war, the lives of our people will inevitably be devastated. Why would we initiate the war? In short, our only demands are unification, independence, and peace.</p>
<h3>Kesselring on Trial</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Venice, 10th] Field Marshal Kesselring, former German commander-in-chief in Italy and Chief of Staff of the German Air Force during the Battle of Britain, is on trial here today before a British military court as a war criminal. The defendant is charged with two counts: (1) For the March 23, 1944 reprisal for the bombing that killed thirty-one German policemen, 335 Italian civilians were killed in the Ardeatine Caves near Rome. The defendant, as the superior officer, cannot be excused from responsibility. (2) He ordered his subordinates to kill Italian civilians in June and July of the same year in retaliation for the activities of Italian guerrillas. The defendant pleaded not guilty in court today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Situation Falls into Chaos Again; Progressive Party Actively Seeks to Form New Party; Yoshida Still Seeks to Form Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 10th] The Japanese political situation, after the Yoshida Cabinet safely navigated the February 1st general strike, has fallen into extreme chaos again within ten days. The Progressive Party, dissatisfied with Yoshida's cabinet reshuffle, after advocating the formation of a coalition cabinet for a week, has recently put forward the slogan of forming a new party. The party held a meeting of its top leaders this morning, deciding on the following: (1) The work of organizing a coalition government is unlikely to materialize quickly due to internal divisions within the Liberal Party. Therefore, a new party should be formed at this time to break through the current crisis. (2) The purpose of organizing a new party is not to overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet, but its primary goal is to rebuild Japan. (3) All factions participating in the new party, including the Progressive Party, must dissolve their respective organizations to achieve unity. (4) The Progressive Party will work closely with those within the Liberal Party who support the new party and appeal to all parties to quickly form a new party. (5) The scope of the appeal is limited to the Cooperative Democratic Party, the Nationalist Party, and the Independent Club. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party are excluded, especially the latter, because it is feared that it would give the impression of dividing the Socialist Party. In the afternoon, the Progressive Party held an emergency executive meeting, deciding on the following three principles: (1) Reject all political actions based on maintaining the status quo; (2) Promote the realization of a major revolutionary party. The new coalition cabinet must be established on the basis of this spirit; (3) The Progressive Party will dissolve immediately when the opportunity for the establishment of the new party matures.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party today suggested to the Progressive Party that the presidents of the Liberal Party and Progressive Party, Kawai Atsushi (Progressive Party) and Ishibashi Tanzan (Liberal Party), and the secretaries-general of the two parties should jointly discuss the current situation, but this was rejected by the Progressive Party because the current political actions of the Liberal Party are premised on maintaining the status quo. Currently, various small parties are quite interested in the "revolutionary" party that unites the conservative camp, so there is more participation.</p>
<p>The Socialist Party is taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the Progressive Party's new party work, believing that the new party work is a transformed development of the "coalition" work, and the new party is by no means a socialist party. Currently, the faction within the Liberal Party that supports the new party movement is the faction centered around Hitoshi Ashida, who is still secretly contacting the Progressive Party in order to leave the Liberal Party. While the Progressive Party is loudly proclaiming the new party movement, Prime Minister Yoshida has begun his third attempt to form a coalition cabinet. This afternoon, he summoned Minister of State Kijuro Shidehara, Minister of Finance Tanzan Ishibashi, Minister of Welfare Atsushi Kawai, Chief Cabinet Secretary Joji Hayashi, Liberal Party Secretary-General Ono, Director-General Okubo, Kita Reikichi, and others to discuss the coalition work again. Ishibashi and Kawai, based on the results of secret negotiations with certain aspects of the Socialist Party over the past two days, put forward a new proposal, the content of which is not much different from the previous two conditions, namely (1) Ishibashi remains in office; (2) Three opposition parties are allowed to join the cabinet; (3) The distribution of cabinet seats is Liberal Party six, Progressive Party five, Socialist Party five. However, the Secretary-General of the Progressive Party, Tanaka, did not attend this meeting. Moreover, the Progressive Party advocates organizing a new party with a very tough attitude, so it is not necessarily in favor of this proposal. At this time, the question is what is the attitude of Yoshida and Shidehara towards the new party movement. The Progressive Party secretly anticipates that Yoshida and Shidehara will eventually have to join the new party. In short, the feelings between the Liberal and Progressive parties regarding the "coalition" issue are not as good as before. It is questionable whether they can maintain a friendly attitude in the parliament, which will reconvene on the 14th.</p>

<h3>U.S. Department of Agriculture Releases Report on World Rice Production</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture released its monthly report today, forecasting that world rice production in 1946-47 is expected to recover to approximately pre-war levels. China, India, and Japan are the world's largest rice consumers. Production in these countries is expected to increase this year, improving their food situation. However, because the domestic situations in rice-exporting countries such as Burma, Siam, and Vietnam have not yet returned to normal, the world's rice export supply is not expected to increase significantly compared to last year. According to recent information, the total production in 1946-47 is expected to reach 7.1 billion bushels, an increase of 11 percent compared to last year, and only 4 percent lower than the pre-war average annual production of 7.4 million bushels. China's harvest this year is expected to reach 2.31 billion bushels, an increase of 200 million bushels compared to last year. Among the three major exporting countries, Burma will have only 1 billion bushels available for export this year, while Siam and Vietnam will have very little available for export.</p>

<h3>Gold Rush; Public Welfare a Concern; Exercising People's Power; Councillors to Discuss Countermeasures; Finance and Social Welfare Committees to Convene Meetings</h3>
<p>[Our Report] City Councillors Bu Yongsheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, and Yang Fusheng, in view of the recent soaring prices, jointly wrote to Chairman Pan, stating in brief: "The soaring price of gold is having a huge impact on prices, and people's livelihoods are in a precarious situation. Even if the government cannot prevent it, it should be regulated. The city of Tianjin has already banned the trading of gold and US dollars since the day before yesterday. Our city has also had precedents of intervening in speculation in the past. Why is it so laissez-faire? The City Council has an unshirkable duty to intervene and make effective measures. We urge the City Government to quickly add regulations so that prices can fall back, and the ordinary people can recover." According to Chairman Pan, he will convene the Finance and Social Welfare Committees to jointly discuss the problem. It is now known that the Secretariat of the Council has decided to convene a meeting on February 14.</p>

<h3>Mayor Speaks on the Fight at the Quan Gong Building "Conspirators Disrupted Order;" "Legally and Morally, There is No Excuse" "The Purpose is to Expand Anti-American Propaganda" "Serious Crime; Government Must Punish Severely"</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the fight at the Quan Gong Building, Mayor Wu met with reporters at the City Government conference room at 5 pm yesterday to report on the handling of the incident. He said in brief: At 12:10 pm today, 19 units of various trade associations such as the city's cotton textile industry, totaling 19 representatives, came to the City Government to see me. They separately described the situation at the time and asked me to uphold justice, order an investigation into the culprits, and severely punish the murderers. At that time, I expressed my willingness to accept. They also presented promotional leaflets and distributed songs from the conference that day, containing evidence such as "Can't drive away the American army, unwilling", "American goods are harmful" and "Bastards who create civil war". The notice stated: "Dear Sirs, In order to promote domestic goods and save the crisis in industry and commerce, it has been decided to invite all manufacturers to the New Capital Theater, Guangxi Road and Tianjin Road (6th floor of the New World Department Store, elevator straight up) at 9:00 am on the 9th of this month to discuss the way forward. Please be there to give your valuable advice, this is addressed to ×× trade association. The Organizing Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Restricting American Goods."</p>
<p>Deceiving the Public Using False Pretexts</p>
<p>After reading it, I felt several doubts: (1) Since the association has no organization, no responsible person, and has not publicly solicited members, it is worthy of study that they use the name of promoting domestic goods to carry out anti-American work. (2) Now is the age of democracy, and all those who talk about democracy are reasonable, but the association should be an exception. All democratic gatherings should have a chairman publicly elected by the public, and the discussions must be consistent with the issued notices. The name and content of the meeting are different, so it can be inferred that it must be manipulated by someone, using the name to lure various trade associations. All those who are unfortunately deceived and participate are said to support their claims and can increase the crowd; all those who do not participate are said to have already acquiesced, this is a planned conspiracy, the purpose is to expand anti-American propaganda, and its crime is serious. The government must severely punish it.</p>
<p>Investigate Clearly and Punish Severely in Accordance with the Law</p>
<p>Finally, Mayor Wu issued three conclusions: (1) The innocent deaths and injuries of citizens in this incident are all the fault of the conference organizers. If it were not for the convening of this "selling dog meat while hanging up a sheep's head" conference, this bloody incident would not have occurred. The government has the right to investigate this incident thoroughly. Not only legally but also morally, these conspirators cannot escape blame. (2) For this incident, all newspapers should show a sense of justice, so that the public can distinguish between true democracy and false democracy, and which is true freedom and which is false freedom. Now in democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, anyone who has a public gathering must report to the local government in advance, and the people of the Soviet Union must have their public gatherings approved by the government. For illegal gatherings, I hope that citizens will report them as much as possible. (3) The gathering at the Quan Gong Building was not informed to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau in advance. Both emotionally and rationally, it is illegal. It is obvious that someone is causing trouble, trying to disturb the social order of the city. I hope that these troublemakers will show their conscience and spare the people of Shanghai! For this incident, I have ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to quickly investigate the matter clearly and punish it severely in accordance with the law, and to expose the conspiratorial price of the troublemakers to the public and subject them to social sanctions.</p>
<h3>General Union Emergency Meeting; Decided to Thoroughly Investigate the Facts</h3>
<p>The City General Union convened an emergency standing committee meeting at 3 pm yesterday, attended by Shui Xiang , Liang Yongtai, Fang Rusheng and more than ten others, to discuss the Quan Gong Building incident. They unanimously believed that the facts should be thoroughly investigated immediately for verification and resolution. The following decisions were made: (1) Appoint three directors, Gui Fusheng, Tang Genbao, and Qin Yulin, to be responsible for handling the matter. (2) Appoint Chairman Shui, Secretary-General Liang, and Executive Director Qiu to visit the family of Comrade Liang Renda and send them 1 million yuan for funeral expenses. (3) Launch the Shanghai industrial community to raise condolences for the family of Liang Renda's death and publish it daily in the Li Pao to show the credibility. (4) Appoint all standing directors to visit Mayor Wu and request that the culprits in this case be severely punished in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The workers' representatives of various industry unions who were deceived into participating in the "Promote Domestic Goods and Restrict American Goods Conference" went to the General Union at 2:30 pm yesterday. Regarding the Quan Gong Building fight incident, they requested that the murderers be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Responding to Fundraising; Consoling Liang Renda's Family</h3>
<p>Since the Quan Gong Building tragedy occurred, the City General Union has reportedly begun raising condolences for the family of the deceased Liang Renda. Various industry unions responded one after another. As of last night, more than 3 million yuan has been received. After the amount is rounded up, it will all be delivered to Liang Jun's family. It is also heard that the General Union has accepted the request of various industry unions to form a Liang case compensation committee to speak out in support and handle funeral and post-mortem matters on the same day.</p>
<p>Also, after learning about the unfortunate incident at the Quan Gong Building, the City Party Department, yesterday morning, Secretary-General Xie Renzhao, Director Chen Baotai, went to the hospital to comfort the injured and to Liang Renda's house to offer condolences. According to the conversation, the City Party Department only learned about this incident after it happened. Chairman Fang Jinjing has not returned from Jinjing. This matter will be submitted to this week's Executive Committee for discussion. It is hoped that the authorities will investigate the responsibility and severely punish the culprits. The deep condolences were offered to the employees who were killed, and an appeal will be made to the society for relief and proper arrangements for the aftermath.</p>
<h3>The Workers Who Were Deceived Into Participating Issued a Statement Proposing Requirements</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The workers' delegation from various industry unions in Shanghai who were deceived into participating in the "Promote Domestic Goods and Restrict American Goods Conference" issued a statement yesterday, saying: "Since the Quan Gong Building tragedy occurred, most newspapers in the city have been able to record the incident fairly. However, a very small number of newspapers with ulterior motives have distorted the facts and reversed right and wrong, which is quite confusing to the public. This delegation, on behalf of all the deceived and beaten workers, hereby solemnly declares and proposes the following requirements: (1) It is clear that we were invited to participate, but it is said that we were forced to enter. (2) It is clear that we are truly kind people, but it is said that we are "special elements". (3) It is clear that songs such as "American troops are going to run away quickly", "Can't drive away the American army, unwilling", "Bastards who create civil war" were loudly sung, but it is said that this is "promoting domestic goods". (4) It is clear that "Down with the National Government" was shouted, but it is said that this is "absolute patriotism". (6) It is clear that guards wearing red flowers and holding wooden sticks, who were arranged in advance, were the first to strike, but it is said that others beat them. (6) It is clear that they are the creators of the tragedy, but they claim to be "persecuted". (7) It is clear that Liang Renda sacrificed himself in opposing the fraud, but it is said that he is their comrade. Our requirements are: (1) We want to avenge the deceased. (2) We want to ask the government to investigate the culprits and punish the murderers. (3) We want to comfort the family of the deceased. (4) We want to help the injured. (5) We want to ask the government to protect good workers.

<h3>Workers Representatives Who Were Deceived Into Participating Went to the City Council to Petition Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The workers of various industry unions in the city who were deceived into participating in the so-called "Organizing Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods and Restricting American Goods" were beaten. The workers selected representatives Hu Kun, Zhang Jian and others. Yesterday, they went to the City Council in Fuming Village to petition where they were received by Secretary-General Xiang of the Council. Hu Kun reported the situation that the workers were deceived into participating in the meeting and were beaten, resulting in deaths and injuries. He asked the City Council to uphold justice. The representatives made three demands: (1) Who was the convener of the meeting? Because the notice of the meeting did not have the name of the person signing, nor did it specify the location, what was the purpose? The singing at the meeting not only called out against the US military, but also against the government. (2) Severely punish the perpetrators. (3) Demand compensation for the medical expenses of the injured workers and the compensation for the families of the deceased. In addition, he hoped that the Council would forward a letter to the Council and take the lead in advocating the promotion of domestic goods as soon as possible. Secretary-General Xiang replied that the matter of severely punishing the culprits will be discussed at the meeting. As for the leadership of all sectors to promote the movement of domestic goods, the Council has already made a resolution, and it is hoped that all sectors will work together for greater effectiveness. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>The Arduous and Extraordinary Beginning: Two Orphanages Combining Education and Care, Shining a Holy Light in the Darkness, Offering Warmth and Comfort to Unfortunate Children</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Several years ago, at the height of the war, when people were displaced and homeless, two true Christians received a great revelation from the Bible. The Bible says, "God is the father of orphans in his holy dwelling," and "Blessed are those who consider the poor...when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you.” These two devout Christians, seeing so many innocent children become orphans in the war, wandering the streets, deprived of human love and warmth, felt a pang of compassion. They believed it was time to carry out God's will, to give these orphans happiness and comfort. Although their power was limited, they could not save all the orphans in the world. But one, two, eight, ten... as far as their eyes could see, they brought them home from the streets, gave them affection, and educated them. One day, two days, one month, one year... the beginning was arduous, and the struggle was extraordinary. This great work has continued for several years. Now, the "Bethany Orphanage" and the "Immanuel Orphanage" have become quite a sight, with nearly four hundred orphans playing, singing, and living in a paradise of love.</p>
<p>Bethany Orphanage Wins Widespread Sympathy</p>
<p>The founder of "Bethany Orphanage," Pastor Qian Tuan Yun, originally preached at the Tian'an Church next to Renji Hospital. After the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, 1940, the clutches of the Japanese reached into the concessions, and even the church could not avoid being under their control. Pastor Qian therefore withdrew from Tian'an Church. He said that at this time, he remembered the biblical teaching "God is the father of orphans in his holy dwelling," and began the work of taking in orphans. He himself did not have much money, but he was unwilling to solicit donations from the outside world. He only maintained the orphanage with the proceeds from selling his calligraphy, sharing the joys and hardships with the children. Gradually, the outside world learned about it, and there was no shortage of conscientious people in society. The sympathy and assistance he received increased day by day.</p>
<p>Envisioning Opening a Farm to Lead Rural Work</p>
<p>He rented a house on the former Route des Soeurs as the orphanage's address. Often, things sent by unknown people were thrown over the wall, and banknotes sent by unknown people were put into the mailbox. Even strangers personally sent money and gold bars. In this way, the number of orphans he took in increased day by day. Two enthusiastic church members sold their own properties to help him buy the former Zhengfeng College site on Jiaotong Road in Zhabei, reaching the current scale of the orphanage.</p>
<p>Pastor Qian said: "I don't recognize this as just a charitable relief effort. I think this is a trial of an ideal, an experiment that combines school and family. I want them to receive a high school education, and I also plan to open an agricultural department and a farm so that they can go out and lead rural agricultural work after they turn twenty." The two hundred orphans he cared for lived a disciplined life, lively, healthy, and very polite.</p>
<p>The Immanuel Orphanage is Full of Loving Atmosphere</p>
<p>The "Immanuel Orphanage" is located within the Yuguang Village on Yuyuan Road. The two small Western-style buildings give an even warmer and more intimate feeling of home. One building is full of girls, all wearing blue cloth cheongsams, each with a red flower pinned on their heads, very neat and beautiful. The other building is for boys, who are also all wearing blue cloth long gowns. When they saw the visitors arriving, they sang a hymn in unison. The singing was so clear and crisp, filled with the world's true emotions of goodness and beauty, truly angelic music.</p>
<p>"Immanuel Orphanage" was founded by Miss Hu Yunlin, a graduate of the China Theological Seminary. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, she saw an orphaned girl with both parents dead in a refugee camp and felt deep sympathy and love. Thinking of the Bible's teaching "Blessed are those who consider the poor," she started by taking in this orphaned girl and gradually expanded her work. Now, the Immanuel Orphanage also has nearly two hundred orphans, receiving careful and loving education.</p>
<p>These two orphanages exist silently in the suburbs of this dark and turbid metropolis, seemingly like two lotus flowers in the mud, emitting a holy light. It tells us that there is still love in the world!</p>

<h3>The Love of Domestic Products Movement Is Not a Boycott of Foreign Goods: Initiator Hu Boxiang Issues a Statement; Absolutely Unrelated to the Quanggong Building Incident</h3>
<p>Following the unfortunate incident at the Quan Gung Building on Nanjing Road yesterday morning, where some people, falsely claiming to be on behalf of the “Preparatory Committee for Loving Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods,” gathered and resulted in a brawl among the crowd, Mr. Hu Boxiang, the initiator of the Love of Domestic Products Movement Committee in this city, issued a statement yesterday, saying: "The Love of Domestic Products Movement, which I proposed at the General Assembly of Members of the Machine Industry Federation on June 15 last year, aims to arouse the psychology of Chinese people to love domestic products, in order to correct the erroneous concept of taking pride in using foreign goods. Those of us who are engaged in national industries hope that domestic industry can develop day by day, and that domestic goods should be given priority whenever they are available. Therefore, the only slogan we proposed at that time was 'It is most honorable to use domestic goods,' which absolutely does not contain any political effect. At that time, we proposed two regulations for this movement: (1) The Love of Domestic Products Movement uses propaganda methods to correct the psychology of taking pride in using non-essential foreign goods. In addition to propaganda, no action should be taken to interfere with or obstruct the freedom of others. (2) The Love of Domestic Products Movement is not a boycott of foreign goods. When promoting propaganda, attention should be paid to avoid confusion. At that time, this proposal was unanimously approved, and it was supported by the Shanghai Association of Domestic Goods Factories, the Shanghai Press Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Branch of the National Industrial Association, the Shanghai Office of the Labor Association, the Shanghai General Labor Union, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai Education Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association, and other organizations, as well as various factories and newspapers, to expand propaganda work and remind Chinese people of the psychology of 'loving domestic goods.' The 'Preparatory Meeting for Loving Domestic Goods and Boycotting American Goods' held at the Quan Gung Building the day before yesterday is absolutely unrelated to the Love of Domestic Products Movement Committee initiated by me. I still have great hope for the Love of Domestic Products Movement and am willing to make the greatest effort. However, I hope that our industrial and commercial circles must pay attention to the correct path when launching this movement, so that this movement can spread to the whole country through long-term efforts and struggles, and generate a great effect, and not fall into a wrong path."</p>
<h3>Student Circles are Indignant</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Since the "Preparatory Meeting for the Movement to Love Domestic Products and Boycott American Products" was convened by the labor circles of this city at the Quan Gung Building the day before yesterday morning, and a bloody conflict suddenly occurred, the Student Federation specially convened a meeting of representatives from various schools at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures. It was decided that the attitude that the student circles should take is as follows: (1) The representatives of various schools all believe that the government authorities cannot shirk their responsibility for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident. According to reports, the municipal government and the police bureau did not make any prior arrangements for the meeting, and after the incident occurred, they failed to stop it in time, allowing the situation to escalate. It is regrettable that they failed to protect the people's assembly. (2) Secondly, the person in charge of the meeting failed to report the meeting location, number of people, and other items to the government in advance to apply for protection, which made it impossible for the police to send personnel to protect it, resulting in the tragedy. The person in charge should be reprimanded by the government. (3) The government authorities should thoroughly investigate the truth of the case, severely punish the principal offenders, investigate responsibilities, and provide compensation to the victimized workers and their families. (4) In the future, the government should try to protect the gatherings of people's organizations and effectively prevent the occurrence of similar incidents. All gatherings of people's organizations should also request government protection in accordance with the law to prevent unscrupulous elements from wantonly disrupting them. The meeting then decided to launch donations from students in various schools to express their condolences to the victimized workers and their families.</p>
<h3>Case Files of the Mutual Assault Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>Commander Xuan Issues a Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the mutual assault case at the Quan Gung Building yesterday morning, at 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the Huangpu Branch Bureau transferred the interrogation records of the detainees to the Criminal Division of the General Bureau. After reviewing the records, the Criminal Division returned them to the Huangpu Branch Bureau at about 6:00 p.m. yesterday. The branch is scheduled to send them to the District Prosecutor's Office this morning for handling. In addition, Xuan Tiewu, who is also the commander of the garrison, specially issued a statement yesterday on this case, saying: "The police department and the police bureau did not receive any notice of the gathering at the Quan Gung Building the day before yesterday morning. It was not until the crowds at the meeting assaulted each other that the headquarters and the police bureau rushed to the scene, arrested the crowds involved in the mutual assault, and sent them to the police bureau for handling in accordance with the law." Xuan also said that we are in a turbulent situation today, and most people need to live and work in peace and contentment. We really do not want a few people to sow discord and increase social unrest.</p>

<h3>Glass Stockings Carried in a Parcel; Returned to the Sender</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] It has recently been reported that people often carry glass stockings in parcels. The customs authorities return them to the sender after they are discovered, which has attracted much attention from the outside world. The reporter therefore specially visited Mr. Wu Chuanze, the director of the postal parcel taxation department of the customs. He informed us that since March of last year, glass stockings have been listed as prohibited imports. Since then, the number has gradually decreased each month. Although a small number of glass stockings have recently been found in packages from abroad, most of them are夹入其地items as Christmas gifts to relatives and friends, which are obviously not smuggling in nature.

<h3>An Old Father Breaks Off an Engagement, a Young Girl Elopes, a Married Man Commits Assault After a Love Affair Fails</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Zhixu, 27 years old, from Funing, who lives in a shanty in Dapuqiao and works as a rickshaw puller, and his wife Sun Wu, 21 years old, twisted up a woman, Ju Fushi, at around 5:20 p.m. on the 7th and brought her to the Lujiawan Police Station. They claimed that Ju Fushi and her husband, Zhou Renxiang, had beaten them for no reason. According to the plaintiff Sun Zhixu: He claims that on the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month of the year, he became engaged to Wu Zhangbao, the daughter of Wu Shunji, through a matchmaker. The engagement gift was 1 million yuan, of which 400,000 yuan had already been paid. At that time, it was agreed that the wedding would be held on February 6th in the Gregorian calendar. However, due to economic reasons, it was impossible to hold the wedding, so the matchmaker was unable to inform the bride's family of the wedding date. Unexpectedly, Wu Tongbao came to my house on the afternoon of the 5th of this month and eloped to get married. His father-in-law, Wu Shunji, was very angry and led Zhou Renxiang and his wife Zhou Fushi to my house on the afternoon of the same day. Without asking the reason, they punched and kicked us, causing both the newly married couple to be beaten. According to Sun Wu, the assailant Zhou Renxiang had wanted to know her for a long time. Before she married Sun Zhixu, he had pursued her many times, but she knew that he already had a wife, so she strictly refused him. Zhou therefore harbored resentment. This time, she married Sun Zhixu, and her father was very dissatisfied because he disliked Sun for being poor and had wanted to renege on the engagement for a long time. Because she married a chicken and followed the chicken, and married a dog and followed the dog, she firmly opposed it. So, on the day before the wedding, she went to Sun's residence herself and agreed to hold a simple wedding. Her father was even more angry when he heard the news, so on that day, he brought Zhou Renxiang and his wife to her home to commit assault. However, her father did not动手. According to Ju Fushi, she did not participate in the beating and only tried to persuade them from the side. Neighbors proved that she did not take action and had no criminal behavior, so she was released immediately. The injured Sun Zhixu and his wife were sent to the hospital for examination. Because the injuries were minor, they bandaged their heads and were discharged. The police also sent police officers to arrest the fugitive Zhou Renxiang and bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Third Temporary Meeting of the Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee</h3>
<p>Construction Company Proposes Listing Prices at Any Time; Resolution Submitted to the Municipal Government for Approval</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee held its third temporary meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday. Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, Pan Shihao, representative of the Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, Jiu Feng, representative of the Cotton Cloth Commercial Association, Liu Jingji, representative of the Municipal Council, and Wu Shufang, representative of the China Textile Construction Company, attended. During the meeting, the representative of the Construction Company proposed that the review of cotton cloth prices was originally based on four items: cotton yarn (raw material), manufacturing, affairs, and other expenses. Now, because the price of goods in this city is fluctuating drastically, the price of yarn is no exception, so the regular price negotiation of cotton cloth has little effect. Furthermore, since the price of yarn is listed by this company at any time, the market price of cotton cloth can be planned and appropriately disposed of by this company to achieve a stabilizing effect. It was resolved to submit it to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>Timber Strong</h3>
<p>The timber market situation yesterday was encouraging, and the asking prices for foreign pine were inconsistent. Because the producing area raised prices, the market price of fir wood increased.</p>

<h3>Social Bureau Sells More Than 60,000 Bags of Siamese Rice; Rice Grain Black Market Still Rampant; Coarse Grains and Oils See New High Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, under the cover of buying, the market rose more and more fiercely, and the gold and banknotes soared again. The sales were brisk, and some speculators added fuel to the fire and secretly raised prices. Each commodity saw a new price, and the situation was extremely bad. As follows:</p>
<p>Rice</p>
<p>The source is almost over, only 283 stones of glutinous rice arrived in the two markets. Although the Social Bureau continued to sell 67,700 bags of Saigon No. 2 rice in large quantities, it was still difficult to suppress the black market, and the black market increased sharply by about 20,000 yuan. Outside the market, rice shops are eager to add to the purchase, and the owners regard rice as consignments, asking for prices, and there is no market for a cargo of goods. Informal quotations for each commodity have risen by more than 20,000 yuan, Changshu Jing has reached 115,000 yuan, and Bo Dao and Yang Xian have also reached 110,000 yuan. Early rice then knocks on the 100,000 mark. The speed and size of the increase are really unexpected.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Only 100 bags of screened No. 2 flour were opened early, priced at 39,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 3,400 yuan compared to the previous market. There were also 200 yuan of Inter Yang flour (100 pounds), priced at 87,000 yuan. After that, the situation was still that demand exceeded supply, and the asking price gradually increased. There was no goods on the market. Until the end of the lunch collection, there was still no opening. Finally, a certain foreign company opened for sale of Canadian Yang flour (150 pounds), and the price was still under discussion, which was 120,000 yuan. Bran is surging, and the document goods kick the ball. Large bags opened at 32,000 yuan, and then rose to 5,000 yuan. Small bags rose from 20,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan. The big one increased by 15%. Wheat has not heard of any transactions.</p>
<p>Cooking oil</p>
<p>Because the raw materials are expensive, the output is not suitable, and the holders are thinking of increasing, so the supply is scarce. The market outside the market is soaring. Lou Sheng oil rose from 220,000 to 235,000 yuan at the close. Barrel Sheng oil rose by 30,000 to 35,000 yuan. Soybean oil also rose by 30,000 yuan. Small cart sesame oil, which is a variety, has a pretty increase, soaring by 5,600 yuan, and the price of clear oil reached the 200,000 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>Each commodity has risen sharply. Yellow soybeans are scarce, and the price has risen by 3,500 yuan. Adzuki beans are mutually accepted by customers, rising by 3,400 yuan. Sesame green beans have all risen. Soybean cake sales are still smooth, and there are also many speculators. If the increase is still there, the sudden jump is 5,000 yuan, while the raw kernel is a sudden jump of more than 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Has Its Own Way to Maintain the City's Food Supply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Shi Mingqi, chief of the Food and Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, the city has sufficient foreign rice reserves, so there is no need to worry about food. At present, stopping the black market selling of white rice in the city will reduce the price of the producing area. Mayor Wu has his own way to solve the food problem. The Social Affairs Bureau is now sending personnel to work with plainclothes personnel from the Police Department's Administrative Office to severely crack down on the black market. If rice shops are caught, their accounts will be audited first and then transferred to the court for handling. However, most rice merchants are cunning and resourceful. For example, the accounts of Jin Shengchang Rice Mill only have one page, and it is a loose-leaf page.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The price of gold in Kyoto fell sharply on the 10th. As of 6:00 PM, the jewelry was sold at 722,000, and the purchase price was 695,000. The US dollar black market followed the price of gold. Most of them only bought and did not sell. The selling price reached 12,500, and the buying price was 15,000.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 10th] The market in Suzhou City was in chaos today. The listed price of jewelry was 600,000 yuan, and the dark market was approaching the 700,000 mark. White newsprint reached a high point of 150,000 yuan per order. The retail price of white rice broke through the 100,000 mark. The Suzhou Gold and Silver Industry Association specially convened an emergency general meeting, and unanimously decided to wait for the evening market in Shanghai. If the situation is still chaotic, all members will not list prices and close the market on the 11th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 10th] The price of gold continues to rise, and the market is even more turbulent. Gold shops here are restricted by the city government, and the listed price is still 620,000. In fact, the actual selling price exceeds 700,000 in the name of adding two.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Trend in Chinese Stocks Leads to Widespread Limit-Up Declarations</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks soared yesterday, with almost all reaching their daily limit-up. For example, Wing On Silk and Cotton Spinning Co. reached a premium of 70 yuan, and transactions occurred. However, gains fluctuated with the gold market's ups and downs. The morning opened weakly, with numbers 133 and 171 being offered, showing a high-low pattern. Wing On Silk retreated to 1055 yuan, and Hua Feng to 1060 yuan. Gold prices surged, pushing numbers 224 and 76 sharply higher, creating a short squeeze. For delivery, a sudden surge to 1160 yuan occurred. Numbers 12, 20, 79, 207, 97, and 36 were available for sale, forcing the price down to 1135 yuan at one point. Nevertheless, the gold market's frenzied jump led to numerous limit-ups, with persistent buying interest. Numbers 145, 236, 85, 83, 207, 224, 76, and 28 all advanced, and number 36 heavily covered its short positions. Consequently, Wing On Silk's delivery shares all declared limit-ups.

Numbers 171, 49, and 180 were actively sold at high prices.

Numbers 71, 83, and 235 all advanced and declared limit-up again. Numbers 28, 117, and 232 all advanced, with transactions occurring at a premium of 70 yuan above the limit-up. At this time, except for Jinglun, Xinya, Guohuo, Li'an, and Shangwu, all other stocks declared limit-up. Subsequently, due to repeated offerings of numbers 198, 197, 22, 85, and 112, and a decline in gold prices, prices eventually retreated below the limit-up. Numbers 49, 145, 198, 14, and 99 were resold, and the off-exchange market was also small. Delivery shares also fell to 112 yuan. At this time, the number of stocks reaching limit-up gradually decreased. However, numbers 219, 28, 188, 179, 79, and 218 actively covered their positions, eventually pushing the prices back near the limit-up level. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Wing On Silk, Hua Feng, and Jingfu each increased by about half. Mei Ya, Xinhe, and Qin Xing each rose by slightly over 10%, and Xinguang by slightly less than 10%. Delivery shares (Friday delivery) Wing On Silk and Hua Feng increased by half, and Mei Ya and Xinhe rose by a strong 10%, while Xinguang rose by slightly less than 10%.

<h3>The Ministry of Education Especially Encourages In-Service Training for Secondary School Teachers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing News] In order to provide in-service secondary school teachers with opportunities for further study, the Ministry of Education has long stipulated special measures to encourage secondary school teachers to take sabbatical leave for further study. Secondary school teachers who have continuously served in a school for more than nine years can take sabbatical leave for one year and still receive their original salary. Later, measures for in-service training of teachers in secondary schools affiliated with normal colleges were also stipulated. The duration of the training class is one year. Students in the training class are selected and recommended by the education departments of provinces and cities within the normal college's guidance area from full-time teachers in senior and junior high schools with more than two years of teaching experience who should be tested and qualified. Priority should be given to recommending teachers who have undergone such testing but have not passed.</p>
<h3>Fifty-Two Chinese Students Will Go to England for Further Studies</h3>
<p>[British Information Service, London, 10th] According to recent statistics, 53 Chinese students will come to England for further studies this academic year (1947-48). They are selected by the British Council and the Sino-British Cultural Education Fund, and many others hold scholarships from the Chinese government. The 52 Chinese students will be distributed among universities and educational institutions throughout the UK to study in more than 33 different fields, with economics being the most popular, with five students. Literature and textiles each account for four students. Physics, mechanical engineering, and history each have three students. Law, biochemistry, neurology, chemistry, zoology, local government, metallurgical engineering, pharmacology, and politics each account for two students. Educational institutions in the UK have rarely been as crowded as they are today. The number of young people returning from the military in the UK who want to re-enter university to complete their unfinished courses is exceptionally large, and the number of foreign students coming to the UK has also broken previous records. As a result, British universities are currently full, and the waiting lists are alarming.</p>

<h3>110th Anniversary of Pushkin's Death: Sino-Soviet Cultural Association Holds Commemorative Meeting, Donates 1 Million Yuan to Build a Bronze Statue</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 110th anniversary of the death of the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and seven other organizations held a solemn commemorative ceremony at the Guanghua Grand Theatre on Zhongzheng East Road at 2 p.m. yesterday. A total of more than 500 people, including representatives from various organizations and guests from all walks of life, attended. The meeting was chaired by Professor Zhang Ximan, vice president of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, who gave an opening speech, saying: "Today, we are holding a grand commemorative meeting here to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the death of the great world poet Pushkin. First of all, I would like to express my gratitude to the staff for their hard work. For the sake of permanent commemoration, our association has donated 1 million yuan in national currency to the Pushkin Memorial Committee as funds for the construction of a bronze statue. Pushkin's life and works have been widely recited by the vast masses of people all over the world, so there is no need to say more. In fact, the name Pushkin in China has become a great name, just like Gorky, Ostrovsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov. I remember ten years ago, with the help of the Commercial Press, our association held a centennial memorial ceremony for Pushkin's death here. The enthusiastic and exciting scene is still vivid today. Ten years later, we are holding another grand commemorative meeting here. We hope that literary workers in China and the Soviet Union will work more closely together to accept Pushkin's literary legacy and his revolutionary spirit." Then, Rogov, the Soviet representative of the Literary Association, delivered a speech, giving a brief introduction to the life and works of the poet, and said: "Countless people all over the world are enthusiastically commemorating Pushkin today, as if they were praising a living person. Pushkin not only lives in the hearts of millions of people in our century, but he will also live forever in countless generations to come." Afterwards, Guo Moruo, a member of the Literary Association, and Fu Shengjing, the representative of the Soviet Foreign Cultural Association stationed in China, delivered speeches, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. After the commemorative ceremony, the entertainment program began, including poetry recitations, singing, violin solos, and dance dramas, all of which were famous works by Pushkin. The meeting adjourned at around 5 p.m.</p>
<h3>Many Chinese Scientists Serve as Professors at American Universities: The Weak Scientific Atmosphere in China Leads to the Waste of Talent</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Many scholars studying modern science in the United States from China have recently been invited by American universities to serve as professors, and the number of people is increasing daily. As far as the reporter knows, the professors in the Aeronautics Department of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include Qian Xuesen, Gu Peimu, and Liu Yijin. Zhu Lancheng is a researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the same school. Researchers in the Chemistry Department of the University of Michigan include Fu Ying. Zhang Jin is in the Department of Biochemistry at the same school. Sa Bentie is a researcher in the Biochemistry Department of the University of Utah. Fu Chengyi is a professor in the Department of Geophysics at the California Institute of Technology. Ge Tingsui is a professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. Wang Qide is a professor in the Department of Aeronautics at New York University. Lin Jiaqiao is a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at Brown University. In addition, there are many others not known to the reporter. Classifying their teaching courses, such as emerging departments such as aviation, if talents can be concentrated in China, a complete department can be established. However, due to the weak scientific atmosphere and the harsh research environment in China, talent is wasted. This situation deserves attention. However, it also shows that China is not lacking in modern scientists. For example, in the list of 250 papers submitted by the US Atomic Energy Commission delegation, there are seven papers by Chinese people, including Zhang Wenyu's "Low-Energy Spectrum of Alpha Emission and the Situation of Beta Emission" and "Radiation Produced by Beryllium," Sun Guanghan's "The Mass of the Neutron," Qian Sanqiang's "Gamma Emission of Radium" and "Precise Organization of the Alpha Emission of Determination," Wang Xianrang's "Estimating the Energy of Heavy Nuclei and Neutron-Proton Pair Combinations Using a New Potential," and Wu Jianxiong et al.'s "Neutron Scattering and the Range of Nuclear Forces." According to reports, Zhang Wenyu is currently a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.</p>

<h3>Paying Close Attention to the Shandong Situation Today and in the Future</h3>
<p>— Jinan, 5th (Air Mail) Our Special Correspondent, Li Tian</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the main forces of the Communist army are concentrated in three key areas: first, northern Shaanxi; second, the Northeast; and third, Shandong. Due to various factors such as terrain, resources, history, and culture, Shandong is the most resilient of these three key areas. As early as August 8th, this reporter pointed out in an article "Shandong's": Shandong may become the second Jiangxi after the Northern Expedition before the Anti-Japanese War. It will become the most resilient, most powerful, and last base of the CCP. Will the government continue to allow it to grow and create future troubles, or will it take advantage of its initial consolidation and "attack what it must defend"? Based on the current state of affairs, there is no doubt that the government is following the latter path.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi's Troops: A Three-pronged Pincer Movement</h3>
<p>The so-called Shandong here, according to the CCP's political divisions, refers to Chen Yi's Shandong Military Region and the Jilu-Yu-Wan Border Region of Liu Bocheng and the Sulu Border Region of Su Yu, which surround it. By the end of last year, the Sulu Border Region, except for the remaining main force of Su Yu's troops in the triangular area north of Ganyu, Hao Pengju's troops, and south of the railway and west of the canal north of Suqian, had largely fled into Shandong. Therefore, the Sulu Border Region can be said to no longer exist in practice.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the Communist army launched an unprecedented offensive in southern Shandong, concentrating six divisions of the New Fourth Army, seven divisions of the Liberation Army, five divisions of the Newly Organized Army, Xu Xiangqian's 115th Division, Liu Bocheng's six columns (six regiments per column), and garrison brigades, independent regiments, militia, etc., totaling no less than 400,000 men, with Xuzhou as their target, and Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng as the commanders, launching a fierce attack on the Nationalist army from southern and western Shandong in a pincer-like offensive. Chen Yi's pincer movement was divided into three routes:</p>
<p>The first route passed through Linyi via Xiangcheng, Lanling, Xia Yixian, occupied Zaozhuang, and then went south to Tengxian to join the Communist army attacking Lincheng.</p>
<p>The second route went south from Linyi to Pixian, and then returned northwest to attack Taierzhuang from the side.</p>
<p>The third route went south from Linyi to seize Tancheng, invade Paoche, cross the Longhai Railway, and join forces with the Communist army gathered north of Suqian at Yaowan. At this point, the Xuzhou-Lianyungang section of the Longhai Railway, which had been opened before the New Year, was breached again.</p>
<h3>Liu Bocheng's Troops: Invade Southwestern Shandong</h3>
<p>In addition, Liu Bocheng, known as the "One-Eyed Dragon Little Zhuge" in the Communist army, led a pincer movement from the Jilu-Yu-Wan Border Region, dividing into several groups to the south to southwestern Shandong, taking Chengwu, occupying Dingtao, capturing Caoxian, and invading Shanxian. By the end of January, except for Jinxiang, Jining, Yutai, and Heze, which were still in the hands of the Nationalist army, the entire southwestern Shandong west of the railway and south of the Yellow River had fallen into the hands of the Communist army. Not only that, Liu Bocheng's troops also followed closely, once seizing the Xiaoba station east of Shangqiu by exploiting gaps. At the same time, gunshots were also heard in the vicinity of Yongcheng, Minquan, Mashan, and Zhaoxian southwest of Xuzhou. Zhang Taisheng's troops in the border area of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan also raided Woyang, Haoxian, Luyi, and Zhecheng. Woyang was once occupied by the Communist army in early January, and as a result, the Zhengzhou-Xuzhou section of the Longhai Line was also forced to suspend operations. The situation in Xuzhou became tense.</p>
<p>This was the situation around the Lunar New Year: the Nationalist army held Xuzhou, and the Longhai Railway on both the east and west sides was paralyzed. Although the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway could reach Pukou, the northern section only reached Lincheng. This pincer offensive of the Communist army had clearly achieved some effects of division and encirclement, and was close to succeeding. If this unfavorable situation was not improved, even if Xuzhou could maintain its glorious isolation, Suqian would threaten it one day, and Su North would not be peaceful for a day. If southern and western Shandong were not recovered in a day, the Linji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway would be hopeless.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Army Strives to Regain Initiative: Communist Army Suffers on Both Front and Rear</h3>
<p>The Nationalist army was in this extremely unfavorable position until the Xuzhou-Lianyungang section of the railway was reopened on January 28, Hao Pengju defected, and the last county in northern Jiangsu, Ganyu, was recovered. The threat on the eastern side of Xuzhou was swept away, one of the Communist army's two pincers had been resolved, and the unfavorable situation was gradually reversed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, to gain the initiative, the Nationalist army launched a formal counter-offensive against the Communist army in southern Shandong on February 1. On the afternoon of the same day, Zhang Lingfu's division, formerly under Wang Yaowu, first reported victory, capturing Tancheng. By the 3rd, the unit had crossed the village of Lijiazhuang, 45 li north of the city, and headed straight for the highest command post of Chen Yi, the Shandong Communist Party in Linyi. At the same time, another unit under Hao Pengju had also crossed the Yi River and arrived at the designated location, awaiting orders to advance. The Communist army in Linyi was clearly shaken, and the capture of Linyi could be expected soon. At the same time, the Nationalist army under Huo Shouyi in central Shandong also went south from Boshan and recovered Laiwu on the 4th, attacking the flanks of the Communist army. Undoubtedly, the Communist army had once again turned from an advantageous position at the beginning of the war to a disadvantageous one, and had fallen into a miserable situation where it could not take care of its head and tail and was attacked on both its front and rear.</p>
<h3>Focus of the War: Opening the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</h3>
<p>However, the problem must be viewed westward: although the development of the war in southern Shandong has shifted from a disadvantageous to an increasingly favorable situation for the Nationalist army, the threat posed by the harassment of Liu Bocheng's troops in the border area of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan to the western side of Xuzhou has not been eliminated for a day, and the Nationalist army in southern Shandong cannot advance north for a day. In addition, due to the limitations of the terrain, the Yimeng Mountains north of Linyi are hilly and difficult to attack but easy to defend. Therefore, even if the Nationalist army settles Linyi, Zhaoxian, and Zaozhuang, it is very likely that it will postpone the northward advance and use its main force to cooperate with the Nationalist army on the periphery of Xuzhou to directly attack the great plain of western Shandong via Jining and Yutai, and then advance northward along both banks of the Grand Canal, directly to the banks of the Yellow River, and then turn eastward to drive the Communist army into the Yimeng Mountains via the Taishan Mountains. In this way, the opening of the Linji section of the railway is truly open, and its safety can be ensured without worry.</p>
<p>This strategic use seems too roundabout on the surface, but in essence, only doing so is most beneficial to the Nationalist army. After the Huayuankou Dam was breached, the Yellow River water has flowed eastward into the sea through the old channel, and this torrential Yellow River, which runs across southwestern Shandong and northeastern Shandong, is like a sharp sword inserted into the chest of the Shandong Communist Party, dividing the Communist army in Shandong into two sections, creating the greatest obstacle to the Communist army's movement and deployment. The Communist army's opposition to the breaching of the Huayuankou Dam is not truly out of love for the few residents of the old Yellow River channel. On the contrary, the Nationalist army should be wary of the Communist army breaching the dikes in the future when the river water is high and the Nationalist army advances, in order to delay the Nationalist army's advance.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire situation as a whole, the war in southern Shandong should temporarily stop with the recovery of Linyi, Zhaoxian, and Zaozhuang. After that, the focus of the war will shift to southwestern and western Shandong until the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is opened. The Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains and the Shandong Peninsula may be temporarily blocked on one side (if they are to be resolved at the same time, it will not be successful unless they are surrounded and attacked from the north, south, and west with overwhelming superior forces). In this way, the Nationalist army advancing north can join forces with the troops advancing south from Tianjin in Cangzhou and open the entire Tianjin-Pukou Railway.</p>
<h3>A Heroic History of the Northern Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway: 20,000 Soldiers and Civilians in Dingxian Break Through and Retreat North</h3>
<p>— Baoding, 1st (Air Mail) Our Reporter in Baoding, Yang Bingsen</p>
<p>On the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve, the Communist army in Hebei Province launched an offensive on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. After invading Wangdu on the evening of January 20, they split up and attacked Dingxian from the north and south. The defending troops fought hard for eight days, but were eventually outnumbered and Dingxian was captured by the Communist army. More than 20,000 military officers and civilians in the city broke through and retreated north to Baoding. This morning, the reporter went to the Baoding Provincial Hospital to visit Liu Jiaxiu, the wounded magistrate of Anping County, and learned the details of the bloody battle in Dingxian. The sight was shocking and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Fighting Bitterly for Eight Days and Nights: Resisting 100,000 Communist Troops</p>
<p>The Communist troops launching this offensive on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section were part of Yang Su's column under the command of Nie Rongzhen, who was entrenched in western Hebei, as well as regular troops from various military sub-districts. It was rumored that Liu Bocheng's troops and others totaled about 100,000 men, and they were well-equipped. After invading Wangdu, they successively occupied Qingfengdian, Mingyuedian, Zhaixidian, Xinle, Dongchangshou, and other important strongholds, and implemented an encirclement war against Dingxian with more than 30,000 main force troops.</p>
<p>Dingxian was an important town in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Before the war, it was a first-class model county in Hebei Province. Mr. Yan Yangchu had been running civilian education here for many years, and the literary atmosphere was strong. The city wall was 40 li in circumference, and it was known for its production of duck pears and pine pepper wine.</p>
<p>On the evening of January 20, after Wangdu fell, Dingxian urgently dispatched two companies of reinforcements to the north to meet them. They were ambushed by ten times the number of Communist troops, resulting in the annihilation of the entire army. The Communist forces took advantage of the situation to rush south, destroying the Nationalist army's bunkers between Qingfengdian and Dingxian, and then surrounding the station and launching a fierce defensive battle in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The two armies fought to the death for several days and nights. On the 27th, the Communist army continued to increase by more than 30,000 men from the side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, approaching the city and capturing the station. On the morning of the eighth day of the siege (January 28), the Communist army concentrated more than 10,000 troops to attack the southeast corner of the city, firing more than 50 shells without success. Then, they concentrated their efforts to attack the northwest corner of the city, firing more than ten shells, destroying the city wall. The Communist army took advantage of the situation to rush in, and the county town fell.</p>
<p>Only Eight Bullets Left for Each of the 3,000 Defending Soldiers</p>
<p>When the county town was first besieged, all the people in the city hoped that reinforcements would arrive early to relieve the crisis. They especially longed for supplies to be airlifted. The commander, Cui Zixin, commissioner of the Ninth District of Hebei Province, sent several telegrams to Baoding for assistance, which shows the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>The Communist army's artillery fire became increasingly fierce. It was not until the more than 3,000 defenders in the city were only able to get eight bullets each that they received the order on the 27th that the aircraft would not provide air support and that they should use a red cloth on the west side of the city as a signal for delivery. At that time, they were already surrounded on all sides and were in the most dangerous stage. Moreover, the reinforcements going north from Shijiazhuang were blocked and could not advance, and Xinle had also fallen. The overall situation was lost, and it was too late to save it.</p>
<p>Cries of Women and Children Shook the Sky During the Breakthrough</p>
<p>At noon on the 28th, after the Communist army invaded the county town, about 20,000 military officers and civilians in the city fled to the outside of the city. At that time, the supreme commander, Mr. Cui Zixin, issued an order to cover the retreat. Therefore, the armed personnel reorganized their guns and prepared to break through.</p>
<p>The Communist army speculated that the defending troops would break through and retreat towards Shijiazhuang, so the artillery fire in the north was particularly fierce, as dense as raindrops. The personnel breaking through the encirclement temporarily decided to retreat towards Baoding. More than 20,000 people were ambushed by the Communist army for the first time more than ten miles north of the city, suffering heavy casualties. The cries of the old, young, women, and children shook the sky, which was unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>Commissioner Cui's Last Words Before Martyrdom: Comrades, Advance!</p>
<p>When crossing the first difficulty, night had fallen. The entire team bypassed the side of Wangdu County and continued to advance north, but the Communist army was boundless along the way, and it was impossible to move an inch. They were ambushed everywhere, retreating and advancing, and were at a loss. When passing through Liutun, west of Wangdu County, they were surrounded by more than 10,000 Communist troops, and were on the verge of despair. Under the sweeping of the Communist army's machine guns, most of them died again. Commissioner Cui Zixin suffered several major injuries, but still endured the pain and shouted: "Comrades and compatriots, please break through and advance quickly!" At that time, the Communist army came from all directions. Mr. Cui, unwilling to be captured by the enemy, took advantage of the guards' lack of vigilance and committed suicide. Jia Jichuan, the magistrate of Dingxian County, also died in the line of duty. By the night of the 29th, military and civilians continued to arrive in Baoding. The authorities are now providing shelter and striving to make appropriate follow-up decisions.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Actively Launches Five-Year Construction Plan; First Phase Determined to Commence This Year</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Liang Feng of this Newspaper, Guangzhou Airmail Dispatch on the 4th —</p>
<p>The Guangdong Province Five-Year Construction Plan, drafted over eight months and discussed by over two hundred participating experts, has been finalized. It has been decided that the first phase of the plan will commence this year, with its core focus on developing production sectors. This news is truly a blessing for the thirty-five million people of Guangdong.  Having been occupied for over seven years during the war, with more than two-thirds of the province under enemy control, all prosperous areas suffered severely from enemy and puppet forces' devastation, making reconstruction and development the urgent priority, the most crucial task to fundamentally resolve the province's people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Guangdong is a province that cannot produce enough food to feed itself. Therefore, in terms of construction, increasing agricultural production should be the top priority of the entire construction effort, followed by the restoration of transportation.  The current difficulties in transportation are sufficient to affect the development of all industries. Therefore, after the restoration, the provincial government should actively undertake farmland water conservancy projects under the principle of "seeking restoration through consolidation and seeking construction through restoration" to increase food production. At the same time, it should urgently repair roads to connect the arteries of society. In the past year, the Guangdong construction authorities have focused on this as their central task and have achieved considerable results, which is a solid foundation for building a new Guangdong.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Projects, Surveys, and Designs</p>
<p>Firstly, regarding farmland water conservancy construction, under the active promotion of the authorities, forty-six local water conservancy associations and two hundred and twenty-nine irrigation production cooperatives were established in the province. Two survey teams and ten surveying teams were dispatched to be responsible for surveying and designing various water conservancy projects.  Of these, the survey of Manghua, Wenquan, and nine other districts, covering an area of 272,500 mu, with hydroelectric power of 3,500 horsepower, has been completed. Surveying of sixteen districts, including the Huaxian Irrigation District, covering a total area of 244,000 mu, with hydroelectric power of 67,000 horsepower, and drainage channels of 40 kilometers, has been completed. The design of irrigation projects in twelve districts, including Meixian, covering a total area of 263,500 mu, with hydroelectric power of 400 horsepower, has been completed. The Yaoming Shisanwei flood prevention project, benefiting 120,000 mu of farmland, and 1,060 small-scale water conservancy projects such as ponds, canals, embankments, and irrigation ditches completed in various counties, have been completed.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the Huayang Ma'anwei, Qujiang Fengwan Water and Laozhai Reservoir, and Dongguan Huaide Township irrigation projects are currently under construction. Among them, the largest project, the Huiyang Ma'anwei project, currently mobilizes over ten thousand people to work every day and is expected to require more than a hundred sunny days to complete. Once completed, it will benefit over 200,000 mu of farmland and increase rice production by over 400,000 dan. After the completion of the water conservancy projects in Qujiang and Dongguan, over 30,000 mu of farmland will also benefit. Once these projects are completed, they will greatly contribute to solving the food problem in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>Conscripting Labor to Repair Roads, Rewarding Private Operation</p>
<p>Regarding transportation, the construction authorities first focused on urgently repairing roads. Before the war, there were 14,518 kilometers of roads in Guangdong Province. However, much of it was destroyed during the war, and only 417 kilometers remained when the war ended.  Restoring all roads to their pre-war condition was estimated to cost over 300 billion yuan, a figure that the provincial authorities could not afford. Therefore, the authorities established two methods: first, conscript labor in various counties to repair roads, using national compulsory labor and calculating its value to give shares to protect their labor interests; second, reward private road rights holders to repair their original road sections and protect their road rights. Under the implementation of these two methods, significant results were achieved. It is estimated that the Guangshao, Guangjiu, ShaoXiao, Guanxing, ZhanShi, and Guanghua lines, with a total length of 5,180 kilometers, have been urgently repaired and opened to traffic. At the same time, the two major trunk lines in the southeast of the province, from Guangzhou to Shantou and from Guangzhou to Meilu, are now being actively repaired. It is estimated that the Guangzeng Highway on the eastern line, which is 75 kilometers long, has already been repaired and opened to traffic. The remaining 448.5 kilometers from Zengcheng to Shantou is under construction. The Guangyun Highway and other roads on the southern line, with a length of 186.5 kilometers, have been repaired and opened to traffic. The roadbed of Hualian Road and other roads, with a total length of 198.4 kilometers, has been repaired. The new road and other roads, with a total length of 1,090.1 kilometers, are under construction. These two major trunk lines are being built by the Guangdong Construction Department, which received 3,400 tons of disaster relief rice from the Guangdong Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, to employ laborers to build the roads as a form of work relief. It is expected that they will all be completed and opened to traffic before the two seasons this year.</p>
<p>Industrial Crisis, Urgent Solution Sought</p>
<p>In terms of industry, due to the dumping of foreign goods and rampant smuggling, private industries have suffered a setback. The authorities have addressed the practical problems and solved some difficulties for them. The provincial factories are also being gradually restored. The factories that have resumed operation include the Xicun Cement Factory, Beverage Factory, Ice Factory, Brewery, Textile Factory, and Shunde Sugar Factory. The factories being relocated include the Xinyi Ramie Weaving Factory, Lechang Transportation Equipment Factory, Machine Factory, and Printing Factory. The factories preparing to resume operation include the Xicun Sulfuric Acid Factory, Maoming Sugar Factory, and Jieyang Sugar Factory. Among them, the larger-scale Xicun Cement Factory had a daily output of 600 tons before the war. However, after the occupation, part of the machinery was moved to the Northeast, and the rest was damaged. After partially repairing the machinery, it can only produce 200 tons per day for the time being. Recently, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration agreed to allocate a 2,500 KW generator and a soil-making machine, which is expected to restore pre-war production levels in June this year. In addition, Guangdong Province originally had a provincial paper mill, which was also one of the larger paper mills in the country. During the occupation, the enemy dismantled all the machinery and shipped it to Hokkaido, Japan, to set up a factory and start production. The provincial authorities are now asking the central government to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters to ship it back, but there have been no results yet.</p>
<p>Promote Mining, Seek Investment</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding mining, Guangdong Province is very rich in mineral resources. In total, there are more than 1,280 old and new mining areas in the province, covering a total area of over 70,400 hectares. The types of minerals include gold, tin, iron, steel, tungsten, antimony, lead, zinc, manganese, coal, graphite, arsenic, magnetic clay, marble, mica, sulfur, gypsum, asbestos, heavy stone, etc., distributed in more than 70 counties. The first step for the provincial authorities to promote the mining industry is to reorganize the original mining areas. After the reorganization and retention of the mines, efforts will be made to promote them. In order to reward and assist private mining industries, the central government was asked to provide mining loans. The Guangdong Construction Department recently decided to restore the industrial and mining enterprises, including the coal mines of Baziling Gouyadong in Ruyuan, the iron mines of Babao Mountain and Sulfur Mountain in Yingde, the iron mines in Wushiling in Yunfu, the manganese mines of Jinniushan in Hepu and Dazhixu in Fangcheng, the oil shale mines of Gongguanxu in Maoming and Yangjiaoxu in Dianbai, the tungsten-manganese-copper mines in Wengyuan, Shixing, Conghua, Lechang, and Yunfu, the limestone mines in Huaxian, the zinc mines in Qujiang, Lechang, Ruyuan, Yangshan, and other places, and the phosphate mines in the Xisha Islands. Developing these mineral resources is the foundation for establishing a modern industrial base. The authorities have organized several mining area survey teams to conduct general surveys and have determined the mining methods. However, the current problem is probably still the capital for development. Therefore, they are now striving to attract overseas Chinese investment to return to the country, so that the land can be used to its fullest extent and resources can be used to their fullest extent. This will naturally shorten the journey for the construction of a new Guangdong.</p>

<h3>From the Glorious Shipyard to Jilin</h3>
<p>— Yongji Airmail Dispatch on the 2nd, Hu Jingwen</p>
<p>Although "Jilin," known as one of the three eastern provinces, has become a historical name, its mountainous embrace, fertile and rich treasures, cannot diminish its value. Fourteen years of exploitation and two severe periods of plunder have thinned this vast territory, but it can regain its strength in the face of difficulties.</p>
<p>"Shipyard" is the old name of Jilin. We cannot forget the meaningful historical fact that in the fifteenth year of the Shunzhi era, warships were built in this place to defend against Russian invasions. Later, it was established as the provincial capital and renamed "Jilin." In the second year of the Republic of China, it was changed to a county. In the nineteenth year, because the province and county had the same name, it was renamed "Yongji."</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, "Jilin" was reduced by the Japanese under their control and division due to its topography. Relying on natural gifts and human efforts, the Japanese gained countless benefits, and the important border town once again took on the central task, forming the active blood artery of the Northeast.</p>
<p>After the restoration of the territory, the government divided the Northeast into nine provinces and two cities to meet the requirements of politics, economy, military affairs, and geography. Thus, "Jilin," which had experienced many changes, took on a new appearance.</p>
<p>Blood Transfusion Road</p>
<p>The only means of transportation in Jilin City, apart from the rickshaws and horse-drawn carriages found in other cities, is the bus that runs from the railway station to the front of the provincial government. However, this seems to be "nominal only," because you often wait half a day without seeing the shadow of a bus, which has led to a booming horse-drawn carriage business. According to locals, "In the past, the Japanese devils not only allocated special vehicles properly, but also completed the main urban trunk lines, and traffic was very convenient through Linjiangmen to Jilin Normal University, the highest institution of learning."</p>
<p>The three railway trunk lines that control the lifeline of "Jilin," namely Jichang, Jihai, and Jidun, are now only possible with Jihai and Jichang, except for those controlled and destroyed by the Communist army. However, Jihai is only able to travel to the Meihekou Station due to the stagnation of the Dunhai Line.</p>
<p>The Jichang Road is 127.741 kilometers long and is already thirty-six years old this year, which is the prime of its life. The main stations along the line are Huapichang, Tumenling, and Xiajiutai. They are also commercial centers connecting Jilin and Changchun. In order to protect this blood transfusion artery of Jichang, the government has sent many brave National Army soldiers along the line and built many bunkers, providing many conveniences to the military and civilians.</p>
<p>The Jichang Highway, which winds for 240 li, has been completed with difficulty. Daily buses have also provided some assistance to the people, allowing Jilin to breathe a sigh of relief from the silence and exhaustion of the traffic congestion period.</p>
<p>Cultural Circle</p>
<p>Due to its past location on the border, there were few intellectuals coming and going, which gave "Jilin" a corrupt and rigid form. Although the country had spent a lot of money here to build schools and cultivate talents, it was still relatively backward. Unfortunately, it later suffered from the ravages of the Japanese, and the damage and poisoning were even deeper.</p>
<p>Since the government recovered "Jilin," it has successively raised the banner of educating people, sweeping away the decadent academic atmosphere of the past, restoring the academic system, respecting practical learning, cultivating teachers, improving education, expanding primary schools, establishing mass education centers, changing ideas, completely eradicating illiteracy, and establishing youth supplementary classes to remedy the absurd and ignorant education of the enemy puppets. Newspapers that lead the people's wisdom have also taken root like bamboo shoots after a rain. There are Changbai, Jilin, and other newspapers established. With so many circles for cultivating the people, it will not be difficult for Jilin's culture to catch up. However, if we look at the teaching equipment in the highest institution of learning, "Normal University," we may be disappointed again!</p>
<p>There is a place fifteen li outside Linjiangmen in Xiguan, Jilin, called Babailong. In the vast square, there are several buildings built of stone, which are the National Changbai Normal College.</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese established "Jilin Shidao University" here. At that time, there were only two or three hundred students, and the school buildings were still sufficient. Now the number of old and new students has exceeded five hundred, and they are still attending classes in the two side halls and still eating and living in one dormitory, which cannot help but worry many students.</p>
<p>New Outlook</p>
<p>"Jilin" does not bear the great hope of Shenyang and Changchun, but if we look at the topography, we cannot ignore it. It has the responsibility of being a defensive barrier on the east side, and it is also a major town in the political center of the east side. It is also a commercial hub in Jidun and Jitong in the east. Even Changchun, which was once called the capital, is not relying on its supply?</p>
<p>If we further examine its own situation, then please look at the internal situation. Due to its naturally endowed mountainous form, it has a large production of ginseng, timber, soybeans, soybean oil, bean cakes, rice, wheat, fungus, astragalus, and other plants. In terms of animals, mink, bears, foxes, horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, etc. also breed in large numbers. According to the statistics on wasteland in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, there are as many as 9,096,357 mu. From this vast number, it can be seen that there is much land waiting to be reclaimed. For the sake of economic prosperity and increased production, we should do our best to cultivate and cultivate, turning barren land into fertile fields and barren mountains into forests. Under the slogan of building everything, if we can weave the traffic lines into a traffic network, then the future Jilin will have endless hope!</p>

<h3>Is Your Child a Prodigy? Problems with Children's School Enrollment</h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>Recently, news of the discovery of "prodigies" has been frequently seen in newspapers. There is one in Guangxi, one in Jiangsu, some recognizing characters at the age of one, reading texts at the age of two, writing characters at the age of three, composing essays at the age of four, and writing poems at the age of five, etc. Whether it is true or false is secondary. However, how many parents are envious, thinking that they have been blessed with a gifted child. Regardless of this atomic age, it is not about superstition or feudal thinking, but the pursuit of knowledge for children's enrollment is also a problem worthy of discussion. The author has served in elementary education for more than ten years and has some insights into this issue. I dare to offer some opinions for the reference of parents.</p>
<p>Bai Juyi recognized the characters "zhi" and "wu" at the age of seven months, which is not uncommon. The author's deceased son could also recognize the character "shang" at the age of six months. Although he was smarter than ordinary children, it was a sign of a short life. Because children's intelligence is limited, parents should protect their brainpower and not overexert it. Often, some parents teach their children to recognize characters when they are babbling, and even boast that their children can recognize hundreds of characters at the age of five. In fact, it is no different from injuring the children's brainpower and destroying their lives.</p>
<p>People's intelligence and foolishness are innately different, but there are those who are relatively clever and relatively dull, and very few who are extremely clever and extremely foolish. Therefore, some parents enroll their children too early, but their grades are poor and they appear to be mentally slow, thinking that they are not worthy of being educated and feeling quite disheartened. This is also unnecessary. Because some people's knowledge opens early, and some people's knowledge opens late. It is often seen that some children have excellent grades at the age of seven or eight, and their test scores are always at the top of the list; however, they regress when they enter middle school. This is because they overused their brains in their childhood. It is also possible that they become foolish like Jiang Lang after his talent has been exhausted. However, there are also those whose grades are low at the age of seven or eight and whose test scores are at the bottom of the list; but they make rapid progress when they enter middle school. This is because their intelligence is just beginning to open and they are trying their hand for the first time. Therefore, parents should pay attention to their children's intelligence and should not expect too much from them or supervise them too strictly.</p>
<p>Wang Bo wrote the Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng, which was full of talent and made him famous with one preface, but he ended up with a short life. In the early Republic of China, Xu Xue'er became the chief writer of a newspaper at the age of less than twenty. His writing was outstanding and his pen was omnipotent, but he did not live long either. It can be seen that people's intelligence is limited after all. Like a tank of water, the first to draw is the first to dry up. As parents, there is no need to hope that their children will be prodigies. Even the problems of children recognizing characters and enrolling in school should be considered according to their age!</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, the age of children's school enrollment is qualified at the age of six in elementary school, and entering kindergarten two years earlier has its principles. Now that the start of the school year is approaching, some parents are eager to send their children to school, and they cannot but consider the age issue. If they are not yet six years old, it is better not to send them to school and only send them to kindergarten.</p>
<p>However, it should be mentioned in passing! Some schools have so-called preparatory classes, which do not have formal lessons and only serve to muddle along; while parents think that their children are noisy at home and may as well go to "guan man" [term for children being rowdy]. In fact, children are lively and active, and being noisy is their nature. If they say "guan man," how can they treat children as criminals? Parents should not expect too much from their children, but if they implement "guan man" and depress their ambition and receive abnormal education, it will make him feel that school is uninteresting. As a result, as he grows older, he lacks the desire to study and has a bad impression. Perhaps he was originally a genius but was injured.</p>
<h3>Also Discussing Blind Nipples</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>On February 4th, the newspaper captured, Mr. Lan, [疑: I doubt] "Sheng Yan's ancient medical method for nipples," cannot help but be skeptical, I have to make some more additions, fortunately, I am for the discussion of the truth, I think Mr. [疑: Lan] will not mind.</p>
<p>The so-called blind nipples are probably the nipples that are flat and inverted, making it difficult for infants to suck. This is a common phenomenon among primiparas. Although incomplete development of the mammary glands is one reason, the tight clothing during pregnancy and lack of attention are the biggest causes. We should know the magic of creation and not doubt it. When a woman is pregnant, due to the relationship of endocrine stimulants, the mammary glands will naturally develop, preparing to make food for the baby, and at the same time, the nipple pigment increases and the brown color deepens. Before giving birth, primiparous women should often wash their nipples with clean water or diluted alcohol, and gently pick them with their fingers, so that the nipple's blood circulation is good and the local development is complete, and so that the tissue is soft, so as to avoid pain, peeling, or milk accumulation, swelling, and pain, suppuration, and other pains when the infant sucks after delivery.</p>
<p>If you have not taken such precautions, and you cannot suckle after delivery, you should still use corrective methods to remedy it, that is, warm washing, warm compresses, and twisting, and then let older children or adults gently suck it with their mouths. Huangqi Rougui Angelica and other medicines are tonics and have the effect of promoting milk secretion, and their function cannot be obliterated. If they are used for those with weak constitutions and insufficient milk and flat breasts, they will naturally be very effective. If they are used for those with flat nipples that cannot suckle, resulting in breast swelling and pain, I am afraid that they will not achieve the expected results. Mr. Wen's experience probably belongs to the former, and I hope readers will distinguish it. (In response)</p>
<h3>Adapt to Your Age</h3>
<p>— Gang Ren</p>
<p>Here is a sentence that can be hung forever next to a woman's mirror, giving her mistress a reminder every day: "Adapt to your age!"</p>
<p>These short seven words already include all the principles and methods for a woman to maintain her moving posture forever; but too few women believe it, they are only obsessed with the idea that youth is the most important thing for a woman. So they think they are already withered when they are still far from aging.</p>
<p>This puts women in a pair of sad glasses, even though they have rich knowledge to determine what era she is in; but in their opinion, not dressing up like her daughter and making every effort to cover up her age cannot show her beauty.</p>
<p>Age is relentlessly summoning, bringing the appearance of old age. A woman cannot use special cosmetics or drugs to transform her old age, just as she cannot make youth last forever.</p>
<p>That's the saddest thing. She is only wandering in the wrong path of finding youth, sad and troubled, and neglecting the avenue she should take.</p>
<p>Age is only an insurmountable enemy when you fight him stubbornly and blindly; if you can adapt to him, he may be a good friend.</p>
<p>There are many middle-aged women who are as beautiful and moving as girls, because they can adapt to her age and her era, and give full play to the good beauty points under skilled and balanced methods.</p>
<p>It is impossible to make a woman in her thirties or forties as sweet as an eighteen-year-old girl; and it is the most foolish thing to try to beautify her face with cosmetics.</p>
<p>A beautiful, elegant, and peaceful face belongs to women of that era; a lively and innocent demeanor belongs to women of those ages and cannot be interchanged. An era is a kind of beauty.</p>
<p>Only those women who create trouble for themselves, resolutely deny her era, and go on the wrong path, abandoning the beauty of her youth when she is young, and dressing up as a girl and making coy actions and all the movements of young people when she is older; no one will not find her ugly, right?</p>
<p>She ignores a method that can be successful, whether it is her beauty or the relationship between husband and wife, it is always a woman who can adapt to her age and develop her personality. The most can be maintained.</p>
<p>Know that women in every period have their own specific personality and specific beauty; to have truly eternal beauty, you must face reality and adapt to your own age! (This article is based on Ms. Diss's "Be Your Age")</p>
<h3>Using the Economic Oil Stove</h3>
<p>— Gui Yan</p>
<p>After the victory, kerosene oil flowed in from the United States, so the fuel used by the people in major trading ports was mostly supplied by it.</p>
<p>The "economic oil stove," which was invented before the war, should also be revived today. However, in the past decade or so, the Chinese have not yet manufactured it to meet insurance standards, so fires often occur as a result.</p>
<p>Based on my years of experience using this type of oil stove, I would like to specifically list several key points that can avoid disasters before the oil stove is thoroughly improved, in order to reduce some potential hazards. At the same time, I hope that the manufacturers can also make comprehensive improvements based on what I have written below.</p>
<p>Nine out of ten accidents with economic stoves are due to the bursting of the lower oil storage container. Because this storage container is made of copper, probably due to cost considerations, it is not formed from a single piece, but is soldered at the joints with tin. Therefore, it cannot withstand long-term heat, which is transmitted to the bottom layer, and the tin gradually melts. The storage container then disintegrates on its own, causing the oil to spill out and come into contact with the fire, making it impossible to control.</p>
<p>However, users must not panic. If there is an empty lead bucket nearby, quickly cover it over the stove. Or cover it with a quilt, which can also extinguish the flames. Yellow sand is even better, as it can completely extinguish the fire. However, using water seems to be the least effective method.</p>
<p>To prevent the oil storage container from bursting, the burning time should be controlled. In summer, it should be used for a maximum of two hours, and it should be stopped when the oil container becomes hot. In winter, it can be used for up to three hours. Although the manufacturer's instructions say that kerosene can be added while burning, it is best not to add oil in the middle of burning, for the sake of caution. If it is absolutely necessary to add oil, the fire should be extinguished before adding it. Also, the user must not walk away while burning the stove. Be careful not to let the oil burn dry. Because if it burns dry, the heat expands and it is easy to cause the bottom of the stove to desolder. Although it may not lead to a disaster, it will cause the upper cylinder to bear the brunt of high heat destruction, and the wicks below will become mostly charred, which is uneconomical.</p>
<p>Because the three iron frame pillars of this stove are inserted into the oil storage container itself, the supporting force is naturally very limited. Therefore, do not add overly heavy pots or similar items, because I have heard that some accidents have occurred because the three pillars could not bear the load, causing the solder of the oil storage container to crack, and then the flames rushed downwards, immediately causing danger.</p>
<p>When extinguishing the fire, the pressure-adjusting cylinder must first be removed with a metal pry bar. (The metal pry bar is an accessory of the stove.) Then gently fan upwards from under the stove with a fan (do not blow with your mouth) to safely extinguish the fire without any kerosene smell. If you extinguish the fire by turning the wick control knob while the cylinder is still on top, the foul odor will take nearly half an hour to dissipate. It will invade food and objects, and it will be impossible to remove it for a while.</p>
<p>During use, if the fire is uneven or too low, it will emit smoke and a bad odor. Use a metal pry bar on the four small hooks on the side of the pressure-adjusting cylinder, holding it and rotating it as much as possible until the flames are even, and then the above problems will disappear.</p>
<p>Finally, I must tell the housewives who use this product that they must keep it clean, and the remaining oil stains on the outside of the oil storage container should be wiped off in particular.</p>
<h3>Wife Wanted</h3>
<p>— Translated by Cheng Zhi</p>
<p>If your wife suddenly disappears and you decide to place an advertisement to find someone to replace her, then your wording would probably be like this: "Woman wanted to assist with household chores, working seven days a week, eighteen hours a day, must live in. Must be proficient in cooking, sewing, medicine, children's health, bookkeeping, basic electricity, and male psychology. Applicants must be physically strong and willing, and it would be even better if they could help with gardening. No wages, but necessities are provided." (Translator's note: "Wife" is originally such a pitiful worker.)</p>

<h3>Lamenting Zhou Zuoren Again</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingchun</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, whenever someone told me that Zhou Zuoren was about to become a traitor, I never believed it. Like a volunteer lawyer, I always defended him, saying: "Don't worry, although I have never met him, this person will never be a traitor, no matter what. If you ask how I know, it is because I have read his books, know his character, and believe his words." As a result, alas, who knew that the result would be unexpected, and he really went down to the sea!</p>
<p>I do not want to lament any traitors. In fact, there is no traitor worth lamenting. One is one, two is two. A traitor is a traitor, and there can be no excuses or pretexts. However, I feel sorry for Zhou Zuoren, but dare not speak it.</p>
<p>In the past, I read Mr. Zheng Zhenduo's Lamenting Zhou Zuoren in Zhou Bao issue 19, and I felt quite the same way. I still feel that Zhou has other regrettable aspects. I am writing it down haphazardly to seek correction from those who have read this article.</p>
<p>In terms of Zhou's cultural status, his defection has had a significant negative impact on the psychology of Chinese cultural figures. However, in terms of his evil deeds, it may not amount to a pseudo-village chief's one month of "acting recklessly," a pseudo-military lieutenant's adjutant's one week of "stirring up trouble," or a senior official's one-time acceptance of something that flew in from the sky! Also, looking at his writings after his defection, such as "Talking After the Wind and Rain," "Talking After Holding a Candle," "A Corner of the Study," "Bitter Mouth Sweet Mouth," and "Before the Beginning of Spring," he did not flatter Japan or mock the central government. In his speeches (according to what was published in the Southern puppet newspapers), even the sickening words "Sharing life and death, sharing joys and sorrows," "The country must be unified, the party must not be divided," and "Joining hands with friendly nations to advance together and jointly complete the Great East Asia Holy War" are rarely found. But he was the Director-General of Education in North China, a thorough traitor. For the sake of the future of the country and the nation, he can only be punished. Fourteen years of imprisonment is what he deserves. Zhou also said: "The sentence is too heavy, can painting a cake fill the stomach?" Old sir, you should know that this is already quite polite. "One wrong step" is not the title of a light essay.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng said: "He later seemed to be lagging behind." Indeed, he was lagging behind, but his remarks did have some wisdom that could be adopted. Now I will give a random example. His proposition that "morality should be made functional, and ethics should be made biological" is very insightful. Regarding the meaning of the latter sentence, he elaborated that there is no classic in the world that can be used as a lesson for mankind for thousands of years. Biological knowledge can be used as a reference for the entire life problem, so as to determine the standard of human behavior. In "Talking About Chinese Thought Problems," he further said that eating to seek the survival of the individual, and men and women to seek the survival of the race, are the instincts of all living things, which evolutionists call will. Humans are also animals, so this instinct is naturally present, but the survival of ordinary organisms is simple, as long as the purpose of survival is achieved, the means are not questioned, and as long as they can survive, they do not hesitate to harm the survival of others. Humans are different. They also require survival like organisms, but at first they feel that they cannot achieve their goals alone, and they must contact others and help each other in order to survive well. Later, they also feel that others have the same likes and dislikes as themselves, and try to get along with each other satisfactorily. The former is the method of survival, which some animals can also do; the latter is the moral of survival unique to humans. The ancients said, "What distinguishes humans from beasts is very little." This is it. Then he said that the highest point of the central idea of the Chinese people is benevolence, which is the development and success of this primitive survival morality. If it is not viewed from the standpoint of biology, the depth of its meaning cannot be understood. These are all very clear and elegant words. I am afraid that his countless similar arguments will be spurned along with his traitorous stigma and gradually disappear with time. The ancient Chinese训 (xùn) "do not abandon words because of people," but the historical facts are just the opposite. Not only are words abandoned because of people, but also other strengths of that person are abandoned. Zhu Yunlin's imitation of Cao Cao's calligraphy was quite criticized by his friends. A disciple of the Huang family in Suzhou, Zhong Mou, wanted to print Yan Gao's Qianshan Hall Calligraphy, but his fellow disciples opposed it to the point of fighting. In Xinghua, there is a large plaque with the three characters "Zhuangyuanjing" written by Yan Shifan. The calligraphy is superb, but later generations removed the inscription because they did not value Yan Shifan, and if it were not for the elders' reminder, they would not know that it was written by a Huai person.</p>
<p>As for Wang Juesi, Ruan Da cheng, and Zhao Wenhua, their personal flaws have all reduced the scope of dissemination of their art and articles that they deserve. Most notably, today Zheng Xiaoxu's calligraphy is ashamed to be hung on the wall; Wang Zhaoming's books are ashamed to be placed on the desk; and the inscriptions and plaques inscribed by Tong Fohai in various schools in Jiangsu have had his name erased. Zhou Zuoren's writings and calligraphy are by no means comparable to those of Wang Zhou and others, but his fate can be imagined. Isn't this something worth our regret?</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zheng's classification of traitors, Zhou Zuoren should belong to the educational and cultural traitors. Educational and cultural traitors, except for Chen Binyin, Yuan Shu, and Shen Qixian, are generally more pitiful than other political, military, and economic traitors. Their lives after becoming traitors are not very affluent, and some are still poor as usual. They are definitely not as capable as traitors in other fields, who can enjoy wealth and glory and swagger through the streets. After the restoration of peace, the first to be reported and criticized are the educational and cultural traitors, because the educational and cultural circles emphasize right and wrong the most and like to comment, and the first to be targeted by pen and tongue are the scum of this circle. This is something that the educational and cultural circles can be proud of, but it is also pitiful. In fact, this type of traitor has a weaker ability to automatically transform; less opportunity to be passively protected; and is very easy to deal with. May I ask what can the cultural people who hold a sense of justice do to those political, military, and economic traitors who have not yet been caught and the traitors who are being protected by powerful people?</p>
<p>Therefore, people in the cultural and educational circles can only remove the thorns in their own eyes, but cannot remove the beams in others' eyes, isn't it very sad!</p>
<p>As for how to deal with Zhou Zuoren, I strongly agree with Mr. Zheng's proposal, which is "to imprison him in a special way, but to make him work, engage in translating Greek literature or something." Zhou Zuoren said in the introduction to his Greek Mythology written in August of the thirty-third year: "When I was young, I liked to dabble in writing. Unexpectedly, I fell into the path of a literati, like a fallen citizen. Even if I wanted to retire, I could not be exempted. Thinking about it makes my heart ache for years. Perhaps a translator can be slightly farther away from the literary world. If I really cannot avoid being a commoner, I might as well change my career from writing to being a translator. It is better for me to do this and complete the translation and annotation of myths, which is my duty, and I should do it first. In addition, there are countless good words and deeds of sages and philosophers in the East and West. I will transcribe them as I have the opportunity, a chapter or half a verse, which is also a Dharma gift." According to this, Mr. Zheng's proposal may be very suitable for Zhou.</p>
<h3>Ninth Sister</h3>
<p>— Qin Ling</p>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approached, it rained drizzlingly all day long. The mud was everywhere, and the land was crumpled all over. Amidst the sighs of difficult walking, I gradually approached home. The first feeling upon entering the living room was an unbearable emptiness. The sky was too dark; the living room, which was shaded by the wooden building, was even more dim. In the past, whenever I ran in, Ninth Sister, who always sat in the corner of the living room, would always call out softly, "Sister." But today her voice was gone, and only a chair lay silently in the corner.</p>
<p>I ran upstairs, calling out "Mom," but there was no answer. My younger brother tiptoed out of the study.</p>
<p>"Where's Mom?"</p>
<p>"She's sick and lying inside."</p>
<p>"Where did Ninth Sister go?"</p>
<p>"She's dead..."</p>
<p>"Dead?"</p>
<p>That pale, sickly little face immediately floated up in my tears. Ninth Sister was unfortunate to be born in this era of suffering. In the first year of the incident, she fled to the countryside with her nanny, completely isolated from the family. When we returned to our hometown and took her back to the city, Ninth Sister was already suffering from spinal TB. In this way, bad luck followed her continuously for nine years.</p>
<p>We were a family with many children. When parents felt overwhelmed by taking care of too many children, the children also suffered pain and made mistakes due to being neglected. This was truly a complex little society, where the strength and weakness of abilities were clearly displayed in competition. Therefore, Ninth Sister gradually developed the habit of being lonely and withdrawn. She did not like to quarrel. When the older brothers gathered together to play, she always watched silently. Sometimes she would show a little smile for their joy, but soon the gloom would cover her again. Even if Mom and Dad always protected her, she was still inevitably secretly bullied by the boys. As a result, her character had the melancholy of an adult. She was a very stubborn girl. She cried softly when she was bullied by others, but when we approached, she would wipe away her tears and remain silent. Even if we tried our best to ask her why she was crying, she would always ignore us. Because her loneliness lost the love of her family, and because of the lack of warmth from her family, she became even more lonely. In this way, she became increasingly estranged from us. But even though we were relatively estranged, we never expected that the last time I returned home would be the last time we met. That day her face was a little swollen, but her spirit was still good. She lay on a stool and folded paper rabbits by herself. Half a month later, we were separated forever.</p>
<p>On this rainy evening, I returned home and no longer saw her lonely and worried little face. Even the coffin had been buried early because the New Year was approaching. Apart from the few old little toys that Mom had packed up for her and the chair in the corner, there were no traces left. She quietly took everything that belonged to her away.</p>
<p>Living in this era of suffering is not happiness. Living one more day is just suffering a little more calamity and a little more torment. But she lived too short after all, only eleven years! Not long after entering the world, she had to bear extremely severe pain and let it torment her to death. In her life, there was no sunshine, no laughter. When she closed her little eyes, did she hate the world and hate people? Mother was sick because of her death. Although there were many children, she always felt sorry for her. The older brothers also shed tears of remorse today because of their past bullying. They asked me in a low voice, "Does Ninth Sister hate us now?"</p>
<p>She lies alone in the ancestral grave in × village. In the mournful winter wind, the cemetery is desolate and lonely. Will she frown her little face because of these cold scenes?</p>
<h3>Small Window</h3>
<p>— Su Dan</p>
<p>No green ivy, no exquisite window screen, no purple velvet curtains, but blue sky, white clouds, night stars and moon embellish this gray-brown small window. Don't laugh at my poverty, my small window is resplendent.</p>
<p>Whenever I am lonely, be it dusk or night, I always silently face this small world. At this time, those long-forgotten colorful memories arouse my intimacy again. Many memories, many dreams, those hazy feelings secretly weave into some images, beautiful and dazzling me!</p>
<p>Now I live in loneliness and am dazzled by the memories of the past. Those images, the countless fragments of colorful dreams, are indeed magnificent, but when stacked up, they are also a heavy burden! But don't just dislike its heaviness, it will also give a little joy of suffering, some humorous smiles... Therefore, sometimes I forget that inexplicable heaviness and love that bit of colorful splendor.</p>
<p>The small window has given me too much fantasy. It is when I am silently facing the small window alone that it makes me reminisce about the brilliant past, like a spider that has formed a web, and then follow the old tracks back, slowly and carefully appreciating the past joys and sorrows in the course of life. Although memory is dazzling me, I don't boast about the richness and luxury of memory (of course, there are also hardships and tears). On the long road of life, I have only walked a short distance. Now I am temporarily resting on the side of the road, just trying to relieve some slight panting. I sit in front of my small window and let my soul have a moment of rest.</p>
<p>Staying here, however, has boundless loneliness, but I thank the small window for the warmth it gives. I silently accept this bit of grace, like a traveler resting, looking back at the road I have traveled, somewhat comforted. In loneliness, I am holding this mood, reviewing the dreams of youth, but in this journey I have not lifted a single flower or grass, empty. Someone should laugh at my poverty!</p>
<p>Really, except for this small window, except for the sunlight of memory that this small window gives me, I have nothing. I have lost my childhood and innocence, lost everything. No, I still have a bit of wisdom left, and with this, I can still appreciate the tenderness of this small window.</p>
<p>I cherish those lost years, and cherish the future even more. I love this gray-brown small window.</p>
<h3>Guanyin Temple Fair – Yang Zhou Continued Dreams Nine</h3>
<p>— Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Ping Shan Hall in northwest Yangzhou is a scenic area for excursions. Guanyin Mountain, close to Ping Shan Hall, is a place for incense and worship of Buddha. Every year, from the first day of the sixth lunar month to the nineteenth day, there is a regular temple fair. During these dozen days, there are particularly many devout men and women who come to offer incense. Along the river at the foot of the mountain, large and small tourist boats come and go like weaving, mostly carrying the pilgrims. There are also those who do not take boats and follow the land route, so there are also many pilgrims on the shore coming and going. From the top of the mountain to the foot of the mountain, reed sheds are built on both sides, selling incense and candles, or buying toys, or selling food, which are both colorful and have everything. Offering incense is originally a matter for adults, but children want to follow to see the excitement, which is exactly seizing the opportunity. When children arrive at Guanyin Mountain, they want to eat the food they see, and they want the toys they see. They pester and cry, finally making the adults unable to avoid loosening their purse strings and spending money to buy a little. Therefore, the general people who sell things think of various ways to tease the children and increase their desire to buy.</p>
<p>This temple fair is most lively after the fifteenth day. The nineteenth day is the birthday of Guanyin. After this day, the mountain gate is closed, and it suddenly becomes deserted. Thinking about it now, the two things that are most memorable during the past temple fair period are the following. The first thing is that on the night of the eighteenth, the North Gate and Tianning Gate are mostly not closed all night. The people offering incense leave the city at dusk. A boat sways slowly towards Guanyin Mountain. After offering incense, they can return if they want, or stay in the boat if they don't want to, and sail to the Slender West Lake to see the moonlit lakes and mountains. It is good to sing a song, or to compose a few poems, or to joke and boast. By the next morning, they re-enter the city in the morning breeze and waning moon. In addition, there are also young people or famous scholars who take advantage of this good night to bring singers and gather in the boats around Guanyin Mountain, striking the deck, drinking from golden goblets, guessing punches, and enjoying themselves all night. The boats are lit with gasoline lamps, which look like bright planets from afar, reflected in the water, shimmering, and even more like blooming silver flowers.</p>
<p>Another thing is that during the temple fair, many young students give open-air speeches at the foot of the mountain, trying their best to promote the abolition of superstition. Although there are few listeners, the speakers are still earnest. This situation was especially intense during the May Fourth Movement. There are also Christian missionaries who spread the gospel at the foot of the mountain, persuading people not to believe in clay and wood idols. Because they are the children of God, they hope that everyone is the children of God. This seems to be a blow to the monks in the temples of Guanyin Mountain, but the incense is still very prosperous. Therefore, they also follow the spirit of compassion of the Buddha and are generous to those who oppose them, except for chanting a few Amitabha Buddha.</p>
<p>However, this temple fair declined after the War of Resistance. By the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, it was just right to restore the grand view, but due to the unrest of Huafu, troops were stationed on the mountain, and people offering incense could not freely enter and exit. The monks also wanted to invite Guanyin down the mountain to be worshipped by devout men and women at the foot of the mountain, but due to the special circumstances, it was impossible to reverse the decline. It made another Guanyin receive unexpected offerings. Originally, beside the Five Pavilion Bridge, there was a private villa owned by the Chen family, called Yu Zhuang. Under the riverside rocks, there is a white stone Guanyin. Usually, the green bamboo reflects it, and tourists passing by this place on a boat will often have the fantasy of reaching the other shore. Since the turmoil, the houses of Yu Zhuang have collapsed, and the Guanyin statue has been exposed to wind and rain. I don't know which believer moved Guanyin to the nearby Lianxing Temple. Thus, the past Guanyin Mountain temple fair also followed to Lianxing Temple. For a time, this white stone Guanyin was greatly worshipped by devout men and women, and the incense was prosperous, far from being comparable to just watching the passing tourists when it was left in Yu Zhuang. Some people say that Guanyin in various places must also rely on fate. It seems that Guanyin on Guanyin Mountain has had a lot of fate in the past ten years.</p>

<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>The English poet, critic and essayist Hazlitt (William Hazlitt 1778-1830) once argued with Lamb (John Lamb) over something, and Lamb was so angry that he pushed Hazlitt to the ground. Later, a friend came to comfort him, but he said: "He didn't hurt me, I don't care about punches, and he didn't hurt or destroy my thoughts."</p>
<h3>An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 165</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"The captain has already planned it out": Yaoqun replied, the captain being Mr. W, "People, ammunition, equipment, all are ready, just waiting for us to launch here."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, I felt relieved and truly admired Mr. W's decisiveness; unlike other Chinese organizations, where even a small matter, like requesting a few sheets of draft paper or a few ounces of tea leaves, would go through several rounds of criticism and reprinting, and whether it would be approved was still uncertain. A public document coming out was like a performing actress, first scrutinized behind the curtain, and even after being approved, it would still move slowly, taking three steps forward and three steps back, making a big show of it, only stepping forward when the gongs and drums urged her on.</p>
<p>Tsurumi was quietly listening to my conversation with Yaoqun, his eyebrows relaxed, but his eyes were staring blankly. I was afraid he had too many thoughts and couldn't sort them out, so I briefly explained his secret mission and our plan to establish an office in Shanxi.</p>
<p>"Old brother, don't worry that I don't understand": Tsurumi seemed to be teasing me; "These things, they churn in my mind several times every hour, how could I not understand what you two are discussing?"</p>
<p>"Correct!" Little Tiger suddenly shouted, like an audience member cheering at a play; but I didn't understand what his "correct" referred to, or what the target was.</p>
<p>"It's not a problem at all." Tsurumi nodded at Little Tiger, acknowledging his support, and continued, "My finances now have another source, provided by the old man, use it as you see fit. Equipment is even less of a problem, just pick the best and ask me for it. Only the 'people' issue, that will require Miss Yao and the little teacher (Pi Hucheng) to put in some effort." The "old man" he referred to was Konoe.</p>
<p>"Correct!" Little Tiger cheered again, "No... I mean, regarding 'people,' we can move some from the prisons, ask my uncle, he can't refuse. Anyway, they're all fighting the Japanese devils."</p>
<p>"Correct!..." Tsurumi also saw Hucheng's support. "But I'm very surprised," Tsurumi looked directly at me, "How have the young ladies become so formidable!" As Tsurumi said this, his cheeks flushed slightly. "I mean, Shanxi, that place is quite annoying. If you asked me to go, I wouldn't be willing; the place is remote, the transportation is difficult... and there are those Red Spears and Black Spears!... "</p>
<p>I now understood why Tsurumi was staring blankly, he was considering Yaoqun's situation from her perspective, and from his tone, he seemed to admire Yaoqun's courage.</p>
<p>The telephone rang, and Yaoqun picked up the receiver again;</p>
<p>"Japanese." She looked at me disappointedly.</p>
<p>Tsurumi took the receiver, nodded to Yaoqun, bowing so low it was almost a bow, and repeatedly said "Thank you."</p>
<p>"Can you all guess who called?" Tsurumi hung up the receiver after the call and turned to ask us. When he answered, he only hummed a few "good" sounds, in Japanese. It was difficult to guess without any basis.</p>
<p>"Matsui?" I guessed from the Japanese.</p>
<p>Tsurumi burst into laughter, laughing so innocently.</p>
<p>"You really wouldn't guess, it was our 'Fourth Brother'. He also went to the garrison branch; asking their military headquarters to send someone to pursue Mr. Ao as well. I think this move is excellent, I just couldn't think of it myself." The "Fourth Brother" he mentioned was "Number 04."</p>

<h3>Glory Belongs to Humanity: Centennial Memorial of Edison's Birth</h3>
<p>— ·Xin·Er</p>
<p>On April 12, 1861, a civil war broke out in the United States: the famous American Civil War. At that time, Edison was fourteen years old. This young Edison independently published a small newspaper and openly sold it on trains while the American Civil War was raging.</p>
<p>At that time, the total population of the United States was less than 30 million. The American president at that time was Lincoln, who led the United States forward, pioneering an unprecedented political situation in the world. The political slogan of the American Civil War was the emancipation of black slaves, and its actual significance was the rise of modern America. The end of this civil war brought about a revolutionary movement in the social system and production organization of the United States. The rapid development of industrial production enabled this young Edison to embark on a glorious path.</p>
<p>Historians often say: The American Civil War produced the hero Lincoln. But few people say: It produced Edison.</p>
<p>In modern history, we can almost omit any politician, but we cannot omit Watt and Edison. Watt's steam engine displaced handicrafts, causing social innovation, while Edison's 1,151 inventions promoted various emerging industries, accelerating the development of the world's industrial age culture. Comparatively, Edison made the most significant contribution to improving human living standards.</p>
<p>"Edison walks the same path as people. But what is the result? He goes to the virgin land that others cannot reach."</p>
<p>The American Civil War produced many millionaires who made fortunes from the war, and these millionaires invested in industry after the war. At the same time, the West began to be developed. A page of Edison's biography is almost equivalent to a modern history of American prosperity. Even though Edison's inventions became tools for a few to make fortunes, Edison's brilliance will never be erased.</p>
<p>Edison was born in a vast background. He blossomed on the physical principles of Newton's era. From an American perspective, it is certainly American glory, but it is also the glory of all mankind.</p>
<p>I believe every reader must understand: In a fragmented China, scientists can never achieve significant achievements in any physical principles.</p>

<h3>New Compilation of Telegraph Codes</h3>
<p>— Yi Ding</p>
<p>Due to the nature of my work, I have to look up the "Telegraph Code Book" more than once every day. Every time I look it up, I get a headache.</p>
<p>First of all, I suspect that the initial compilation of this Chinese telegraph tool book, regarding the selection of characters, was based on the subjective formulation of a few people, or was it obtained through statistical summaries of many telegram drafts to obtain the vocabulary of the most commonly used characters. What is placed before us is: approximately a quarter of the obscure characters, strange characters, broken-style characters, variant characters, ... mixed in the main compilation before "7902" (for example, "1427" "朶", "0027" "、", or "0054" "亅"...) while, conversely, many of the most commonly used characters are placed in the "Supplement" after "8001", and the "Supplement to the Supplement" after "9687" (for example, "8082" "偷", "8705" "煙"...), is it really that the character "偷" is not as commonly used as the character "朶"? Is it really that "、" or "亅" is more commonly used than the character "煙"?</p>
<p>Although the Chinese radical character search method has innate shortcomings, the radical arrangement does not necessarily have to adhere to the "unwritten law" of the "Kangxi Dictionary," and related similar radicals can be arranged together as much as possible. For example, for four-stroke radicals, "心," "毛," "爪," and "父," "母" can be strung together, and "行," "竹," "　," "舛" of six-stroke radicals can also be brought as close as possible. Isn't this more "organic" than the current one?</p>
<p>Speaking of "telegraph codes," we always think of the thirty poetic rhyme categories of the "Rhyme Category for Date Sequence," such as "東" representing "the first day," and "冬" representing "the second day." Although this method saves a little compared to the original character, it is still very clumsy and not easy to remember. The recent promulgation of using "99××" to represent the date sequence (such as "9915" representing "the fifteenth day") is indeed much more progressive. Similarly, there is "98××" representing time (such as "9814" representing "2 pm"), which are both very good and flexible methods. However, we still feel that it is not enough. For example, the "monthly sequence" for the twelve months of each year still uses the "Twelve Earthly Branches," that is, the "Twelve Time Periods," to replace them in official telegrams (for example, "寅" representing "March"). It is not easy to remember, and it takes a lot of counting to use. Moreover, it is not included in ordinary telegraph books. This common practice seems to lack "legislative procedures."</p>
<p>Modern people's lives are becoming more and more tense. In the past, people would say "attending court at the Mao hour," but now they have to say "starting work at 8 am sharp." In fact, even though the unit of two hours has been shortened to one hour, it is still not enough. Don't we see such phrases in news telegrams: "Completed in thirty-nine minutes" "Set sail at ten fifty-five"...? We very much hope that we can also create an easy-to-remember and easy-to-use code like "99××" and "98××" to represent these numbers. Or stipulate a "prefix," with the following four digits representing "hour" and "minute," such as "1431" representing "2:31 pm."</p>
<p>When colleagues in the newspaper industry requested the Ministry of Communications to reduce news telegram fees last time, they also mentioned the point of compiling a "News Abbreviation Vocabulary." We urgently need to follow this vocabulary, and at the same time, we also hope to take the opportunity to thoroughly revise the current "New Compilation of Telegraph Codes."</p>
<h3>Young Edison on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>The illustration shows Edison selling newspapers on the train.</p>
<h3>King of Invention</h3>
<p>— Jin Xia</p>
<p>The life of the "King of Invention" Edison is full of amazing stories. He achieved the greatest achievements for mankind from a humble background. He invented and improved no fewer than 1,151 items and equipment.</p>
<p>In addition to the well-known electric light, phonograph, and moving pictures, Edison's inventions include: automatic number recorder, automatic sequence machine, duplex telephone, carbon transmitter, Capon news delivery machine, micro-manometer, alkaline storage battery, magnetic ore separator, trackless tram, electric railway, loudspeaker... and so on.</p>
<p>His contribution to scientific culture can be described as unparalleled in ancient and modern times; and Edison was humble, honest, diligent, sincere, and full of compassion. He is not only a gifted genius, but also a complete person.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Everything to Science, Forgot His Own Name</h3>
<p>— Qing Huang</p>
<p>Edison focused all his thinking and memory on scientific research; therefore, he was often forgetful about other things that were not related to his work.</p>
<p>Once, Edison was standing in line, waiting to pay taxes. His mind was focused on an invention. When the tax collector asked him for his name, Edison couldn't answer. He intended to fumble for a business card, but he had forgotten to bring it. Later, it was a acquaintance standing behind him who answered for him, and the matter was resolved.</p>
<h3>Edison in his youth.</h3>
<h3>Edison is a Great Genius</h3>
<p>— Lu Dunfu</p>
<p>But he said that the definition of genius is: "One percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."</p>
<p>Edison's family, generation after generation, lived to old age. His great-grandfather lived to one hundred and four years old, and his grandfather lived to one hundred and two years old. Although he himself was "slightly inferior," he also lived to eighty-four years old, without any illness.</p>
<p>At school, Edison was scolded by teachers as a muddlehead, and the town's doctor arbitrarily diagnosed him with a brain disease. Only his mother discovered his genius and educated him herself. Before the age of twelve, Edison had finished reading Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," Hume's "History of England," Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy," and the "Scientific Encyclopedia" and other great works.</p>
<p>The first book that guided Edison to study science was Ganot's Physics.</p>
<p>The invention that Edison was most proud of in his life was the phonograph. After inventing it, he spent ten years studying and improving it. He studied records and human voices, and investigated the effects, functions, and limitations of various orchestras. He also hired many musicians to listen to them play music. In ten years, he listened to no less than 25,000 kinds of music, all of which he recorded on the phonograph. His laboratory was the most perfect "music library" in the world.</p>
<p>Edison used the phonograph to comfort people's hearts from their ears, and also invented movies, making people's hearts happy from their eyes.</p>
<p>On February 11, 1931, Edison and his wife held a grand celebration for their 84th birthday and participated in the opening ceremony of the Edison Bridge over the Caloosahatchee River. When reporters asked him "What are the elements of success in life?" the kind old man said</p>
<p>"Ambition and voluntary work."</p>
<p>"What is genius?"</p>
<p>Edison said:</p>
<p>"Genius refers to one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."</p>
