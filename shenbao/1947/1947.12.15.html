<h3>美兩院聯席委會商定我國列為受助國家法案今提參衆兩院討論</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十三日電〕參·衆兩院聯席委員曾，十三日商定緊急援外法案，包括政府要求之全數五億元千七百萬元，併援助中國在內。參院外交委員會主席范登堡稱：此項折衷援助案，將於十五日提出參院討論，衆院亦可能於同日加以批准。按參院曾通過杜魯門總統要求之援助總額五億元千七百萬元，僅用於法，義，奧三國。衆院旋削去七百萬元，並規定五億九千萬中，應提出六千萬元給予中國。聯席委員會除對撥給總數協議外，並須解決若干修正點，大部份爲衆院所提出。范登堡向報界稱：各參議員經過長時間討論後，同意包括援助中國在內，四國應得款項之分配，日後在撥款法案中規定之。好在中國所得之任何款項，必自其餘三國分出，一部份參議員原以爲中國不應列入特別規定援助西歐之法案內，但因衆院「開門」，故參院不擬「關門」。</p>
<p>〔又電〕參·衆兩院聯席委員會又商定下列諸點：　規定一九四八年三月底爲援助之終止期。　美國明年度應保存小麥及麵粉一億五千萬蒲式耳，除非杜魯門總統在三月一日時認爲無此必要。　取消直接提及共產黨，共產主義及蘇聯，但對共產黨獲得控制之任何國家，得停止其援助。　准許政府所設之商品貸款公司依照救濟計劃，供應任何過剩食物如水果，蕃　及一部份烟葉。　取消衆院之修正案，即設立特別委員會監督對外援助計劃一案。　准許復興銀公司在撥款案通過前，　款一億五千萬元，使援助計劃得以開始。</p>
<h3>美將與受助國訂立雙邊協定</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十三日電〕美衆院撥款委員會，刻正草擬法案，以自財政部方面獲得款項，履行應急援助方案，鑒於在聯總結束後，救濟法案下尙有未撥出之一千八百萬美元，故甚可能此款額將於未來撥款法案下，指撥予中國。事實上，此即在减少中國在應急援助法案下所獲得之款額，而以此减除之額外款額，畀予歐洲三國。最後法案授權復興銀公司，於國會撥款之前，提前撥出一億五千萬美元，以履行法案，並規定明年三月卅一日爲截止日期，屆時此項款項將不復有任何束縛。美國並將與各受助國訂立雙邊協定，特別規定此等國家，獲得救濟之條件及誓遵協定各條款等，此種條款，將甚類似聯總結束後救濟協定之現行條款。聯總結束後，救濟中國方案下之二千七百五十萬美元，僅係在其初步階段，故據估計，此項款額在國務院提出援華方案前，當可使中國渡過時艱，此項款額，將不在應急援助方案下之將來撥款中扣余。</p>
<h3>簡貫三談旅美觀感　物價上漲美元價值必低落</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十四日電〕立法委員簡貫三，於十月初赴美考察，現已返國，頃就記者所詢，述其旅美觀感於次：美國自一九三九年至本年九月底之物價，如食物，衣服，房屋，工資，煤斤，木料，平均漲至百分之九九點九，本年最後三個月，將比去年同期上漲百分之十，本年全年之物價，可能漲至百分之十五至廿。據美全國製造家協會報吿，現在美國貨幣流通量，三倍於一九三九年，而工業生產量，只達到百分之七十，此項差額，實係美國物愧上漲之主因。至於戰後援助國外之款，在一百六十二億五千萬元以上，以及本年六月底止，銀行貨款總數在三百九十億元以上之信用擴張，爲其次要因素，以現在美國內外情勢觀察，此類因素，一時不易消除，故今後美國物價勢必繼續上漲，美元價値，勢必隨之低落，我國投機商人擅自將美金繼續抬高，無異掩耳盜鈴，况我國經濟情况如此艱難，少數富戶豪商若再執迷不悟，依然　得無饜，必有同歸於盡之時，屆時雖腰纏萬貫美鈔黃金者，亦有不能獨享共福之痛。美國物價旣係繼續上漲，故若干物品價格，較之中國猶高，且中國之輕工業如襯衫，襪子，被單，手帕等，以及中國之毛紡織品，並不比美國之質料低劣，更何必歡迎外貨而輕視國貨。總之，美國有其長處，亦有其短處，我國對於美國之態度，應以批評者客觀的立塲，隨時硏究其得失，指陳其是非，方顯出自立自重而取得美國人之信服，否則適足以發生相反之結果。</p>

<h3>公務員指數發薪　能否實行難預料</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕文武職公敎人員待遇按照生活指數發給之辦法，原定自明年一月起實施，且由主計處召集之調整待遇委員會亦對調整原則討論決定，頃聞主管財政部份認爲如按此辦法發薪，則國庫負担將過重。據徐堪談：調整之辦法實施後，國家預算將大爲增加，故此辦法是否能如期實行，尙難逆料。參政會駐委會將於本週之例會中提出討論。</p>
<p>〔又電〕卅七年度上半年度國家總預算，業經國務會議通過，其編製之原則爲按照卅六年十一月份伸算。按卅六年十一月·十二月兩個月份之經常費，係依照原預算不分等級及追加預算伸算併計，追加八成者。又悉：十一·十二兩月份追加八成後，國家總預算共追加一九〇二億一九二九萬二千元。</p>
<h3>經部協助貸款發展淮南路礦謀京滬燃料供求適應</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十四日電〕經濟部爲謀京謀，滬各地工業燃料之供求適應，以求達到生產之增加起見，特　重於皖省淮南鐵路淮南煤礦之發展，頃悉：淮南礦路公司現已在開關鳳合縣八公山新礦，並着手修復由水家湖至裕溪口之鐵路，經部並協助其向四聯總處貸到建設費一二〇億元外，並函請續貸一二〇億，以完成全部工程。至關於由水家湖至裕溪口之鐵路，其原有路基及橋樑業已修復，僅鋼軌·枕木尙未數設，現枕木已向加拿大訂購，即可陸續交貨，鋼軌需款一五〇萬美元，已由央行先爲担保，故該路可望於明年下半年恢復通車</p>
<h3>美加華僑選舉監委　國府准變通辦理　八省國民黨立委候選人審査竣事</h3>

<h3>蘇聯延不遣返日俘　盟總部會提抗議　被蘇羈留日俘達七十萬</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日合衆電〕盟軍總部會抗議蘇聯以「氣候關係」爲藉口，宣布北部各港之遣返日俘工作，在明年四月以前將暫行停止。盟總幷曾建議派遣破冰船前往淸除海道，以使遣俘船隻通過。盟總於對蘇聯遣返日俘工作進行太慢之另一次抗議中，曾致函蘇聯代表團長克斯林科，指出一九四六年同期之數月中，蘇聯曾從相同之二港：西伯利亞之奈霍德卡，與庫頁島之眞崗，遣俘二萬二千人。盟總派遣破冰船之建議，未被接受，乃又建議蘇方可自校溫暖之海港遣俘。函中又稱：「盟　最高統帥部準備予蘇方以一切可能之協助，以維持原經議定每月自蘇聯統治區遣俘五萬名之進度。」蘇聯當局於宣布暫停遣俘時，曾援引一九四六年十二月原協定之條款，該條款說明如週末可逆料之情況發生，則雙方保留有暫停遣俘活動之權。過去六月來，遣俘問題，已成盟國對日管制委員會之一大困難，而盟總責迄在對蘇聯之拖延策略作有力之抗議，蓋事實上原押其他盟國之母一日俘，皆早已遣返日本也。根據最後報告。被　留於蘇聯控制地區之新戰俘與平民，仍在七十萬人以上。</p>

<h3>英國不應再堅持！</h3>
<p>當　世渴　對日和會早日召開之際，英國政府於十三日分別照會中蘇兩國，事　拒絕蘇聯所提中英美蘇四國外長於明年一月在中國舉行會　起草對日和約的　議，並堅決反對中蘇兩國所提四　代表在未來對日和會保留否決權的要求，使遠東的僵局，經中國調和美蘇兩國的意見獲有轉機之後，又復陷於僵局了。凡是渴望遠東締造和平早日成功的人們，對於英國致中蘇兩國的照會，實在不能不表示失望與扼腕。</p>
<p>自日本投降迄今，已逾兩年又三個月；但是對日和約的起草工作，至今尚未開始進行，怎教與遠東有關各國不表示焦急不安！戰敗後的日本，雖在盟軍的佔領與　師的管制之下，但是日本復興的神速，使任何一國不感受到日本侵略勢力行將東山再起的威脅；就是美國當局，甚至在　師本人，也無不盼望對日和約早日締結。所以在今年的八月間，美國會提議召開對日和約初步會議；我國不論爲本身的利益計，或爲遠東和平的百年大計著想，始終是希望對日和約能早日商談早日締結的，所以對於任何建議，凡足以促成對日和約的，無不表示歡迎；對於美國的建議，更願其早日實現。惟美國的建議，不論對於召開和會的程序或對於四強否決權問題，均與蘇聯的意見相左。雙方的意見如果不能調和而獲致妥協，則對日問題的僵局，終是無法打開的。因此我國政府乃於十一月十七日，提出一個調和美蘇雙方意見的建議，要點有二：﹫對日和約初步會議應由遠東委員會全體會員國組成之，但由中英美蘇四國從早商定召開日期，以便起草對日和約，並商決與召開對日和會有關之專項；　對日和約初步會議之表決，以全體委員國之多數爲之，（過去所提爲三分之二的多數，而今則爲過半數之多數），但在該項多數內，必須包括中英美蘇四國之同意票。</p>
<p>我國的建議，不僅能調和美蘇的意見，而且對於其他八國的地位，也無不予以非常的尊重，實在是一個合理的具有建設性的建議，如果其他各國都能本著忍讓的精神，以中國建議作爲談判的基礎，則對日和約的僵局自不難打開，而獲得急轉直下的發展。所以從那一天起，我們就引領等待英美蘇三國的切實答覆。</p>
<p>蘇關的覆文首先於二十八日送達我國，其內容雖仍與美國的意見大相逕庭，但倒與我國建議比較接近，足見蘇聯對於日本問題，決非無妥協的餘地。蘇聯的覆文除建議四國外長於明年一月在中國舉行會議起草對日和約而外，並堅決要求四強保留否決權。我們不論根據現實，或以法現的觀點而論，蘇聯的建議實有其充分的理由，而不﹫一種強詞奪理的主張，英美兩國自應予以縝密的考慮，尤應在互忍互讓的原則之下，謀取雙方意見的妥協。</p>
<p>但是我們看了英國的覆文，可知英國政府不特反對四強否決權，而且依舊反對由四國外長會議起草對日和約，甚至對於在華開會亦表示冷淡。英國的態度是如此，美國的態度亦必如此，自不待言，對日問題的僵局打不開，也是顯而易見的了。</p>
<p>我們平心而論，英國的外交跟了美國跑，唯美國的馬首是瞻，對於英國本身固　有益，但是放大眼光，瞧瞧目前遠東的危局，列強對於日本問題，實在不應該再堅持成見了。我們要具文外相明瞭這一個事實，四強意見分歧，打不開遠東的僵局，對日和會就無法召開，其結果所　，徒有利於戰敗的日本　而已。倫數泰晤士報十一日社論，亦以日本禍　　伏爲　英國外交當局，對於日本問題應該採取什麼態度？　有　加考慮的必要。</p>
<p>從史的立場觀察新疆　（下）</p>
<p>續昨日星期論壇</p>
<p>三·研究新疆史的態度</p>
<p>從世界文明的總立場去看新疆文明，可以使人發生人類進化是通體相關的博大感想，也會使一般社會覺行進化的意義，而知有所抉擇。今天是原子能革命時代，站在此進化的分水嶺上，引領四望，心中是如何　之激越與自負，不但限底所收之新疆史觀已　陳腐，即一切所謂新興的文明，亦無不顯得陳舊。就事實論，則對於各種現存的史觀仍須加以耐心的檢討，虛心的其望，及熱心的策　，我認爲編新疆史必須如此，編中國史或世界史，亦須要如此，也衹有如此，　是健全的知識權力，才有一股原子能時代的道德精神上的力量！</p>
<p>自空間言，世界文明之擴大，大致是由點而綫而面而　而球，而新疆文明所處之地位，自時間言，則新疆史料之形成，我們建議分爲兩階段以便檢討，一是古典的史料，一是近代的史料，在處理古典史的階段中，我們要注意的是中國，回教諸國，西方，及蘇聯各種史料之歸納與分析，及其相互比較的成績，在處理近代史的階段中，我們要注意的則是上列各種史料之綜合與演繹，及其各自綜合的出路。然後再從這些基礎上，去建立更高的世界精神，而賦於新疆其所應得的世界地位。</p>
<p>四·從中國歷史看新疆</p>
<p>在古典史料中，中國的古典史料是最古典的史料，要研究新疆的古典史而不明中國的古典史料，必等於瞎人說夢，這是無可爭辯的一點。但是中國的古典史料不是沒有缺點，最大的缺點就是在時間的順序上往往中斷，衹在盛世時才有比較充實的內容，在衰世時就變成支離，斷續，以至完全空白或脫節，這是必須特予揭發的現象。</p>
<p>因爲中國人是世界上最重視歷史錄的民族，所以我們可以很幸運地把這些時間上的毛病找出，讓今後注意中國古典史者有所警惕：即中國古典史之內容，皆隨中國歷代西漸勢力之消長而決定其內容的詳略，故此很明顯地形成了漢唐元淸四個中心，而中心與中心之間，便常被忽略跳過或僅存極微細的聯　。大體上從公元前一二六年（元朔三年）到公元後七九○年（貞元六年），那自張　甘父東返到唐失西域的九一六年間，雖有一小半時間，情況不甚明瞭（共四二入年　即自一七六年—　平四年—于　叛東漢強大到六○六年－大業二年－裴炬重新經略西域的前一年爲止，因爲這時多數應史家都逃到長江去了。）便大致上各種紀錄選算　　，可以摸得到線索，這是中國古典史對新疆的最大貢獻。次之，從七九一年（貞元七年）起至一二○八年（宋寗宗嘉定元年，成吉斯汗於次年侵入新疆，開展元史）間，則是一個四百零七年的空白，資料特別稀少，簡　　　其妙再次從一三三一年起（察合台汗　開始內亂，情況混　）到一七一四年（淸　康安入　巴　　之前一年）的三八三年間，又是一個空白，　　大　不少，並且在上列的丙個空白當中（即一二○九至一三三○間的一二一年）的資料，是　　本位的元史，內容亦不大淸算而且不受一般中國史家的　視，故從七九一年直到一七一四年間的一○二三年，前後約有十個世紀，可說都是若斷若續的空白，綜括起來，則是比較明白的時間佔一半（一○三七年），而不淸　或根本脫節的時間亦佔一半，　　內容就是中國史家研究西域的主要根據</p>
<p>次之，中國的古典史家　於張　的探險傳統，所最感興趣的差不多都在地理方面，如歷代正史的地理志，僧人及使臣的旅行紀事，以及「西域　志」「新疆　志」，「西域水道志」之類，其重心均以地理之考證爲主要任務，都在地理的立志上去敘述歷史，故缺乏聯　的見地，亦由此而無法打破新疆綠州的孤立性，他們好像始終不能擺脫一個三十六國的傳統觀念，更沒有能力在文化上將其分類，這種以地理爲中心的觀念流　所及，是中國近代史家不能明瞭新疆文化的主要原因之一，也是衹注意土地不重視人民的原因之一。</p>
<p>在這個殘缺不全的史料及地理觀的基礎上，中國的近代史家們企圖綜合出一個系統來，此一學術上的運動開始於　　禹　亭林等的啓示，而發達於道光以後流行的邊　地理學（如徐松·方秋　·張石洲·　定　·魏源諸氏），他們的努力雖有綜合過去的古典史料之功，但是他們不能超過他們的限度，而由於不明世界情況而自然發生的錯誤亦在意中，不幸這些似是而非的考據，至今天　　許多人認爲天經地義似的運用著，毛病便從這襄出來。</p>
<p>西方學部來到後，綜合工作　　正開始，　正具有科學頭腦和客觀態度的史學家出現了，他們翻譯西作，考據民族·宗教·及文化，和西人一同考古，發掘高昌·樓蘭·北庭·但是他們的注意也受了古典史限度的影響，他們多數衹在做古典中具有豐富內容之古代部份中的專精工作，而尚未發揮其能力去做大　的補白工作（一千年的空白！）因此中國近代化的綜合工作也可說尚未開始，比較已經具體化的，惟曾向吾氏的「中國經營西域史」而已。</p>
<p>基於上述的中國方面情形，我的結語是；中國方面的新疆通史做法，如果草率地依據目前的基礎來做，是不容易避免不受傳統的影響的。這種影響便是漢唐盛世時代之地理的，國防的，盲目自大的傳統觀念。</p>
<p>五·蘇聯的影響</p>
<p>此在加一方面也很重要的，則是蘇聯方面的努力。</p>
<p>蘇聯文明的傳統，雖僅不過百年；但是他的影響則是空前的，規模是世界性的，全人類性的，全社會和全文化性的，所以蘇聯方面的史學工作，其抱負之大，力量之集中，以及與現實關係之密切，亦非其他方面之歷史工作所能比擬，我們出於多種原因，雖不能充份明了蘇聯研究新疆史的底蘊，而且蘇聯目前的一些現象來加以研究，尤其希望與蘇聯方面的學者，共同合作，來解決許多在中國·向教諸國，以及西方的古早傳統努力下所不能解決的史料問題。</p>
<p>第一；我們知道蘇聯在中亞一帶的大規模發掘工作，已經超過目前世界的總成績，而且間接上對於新疆各地的考古調查，亦非西方學者的零星努力所趕得上，我們知道在盛世才時代，中亞的考古工作，已深入到石器時代，靑銅器時代文明普遍調查更有新的貢獻，所以蘇聯雖是一個新的國家，蘇聯的學者雖屬於最新的學派，但是他們所　的基礎工作卻是　　的，因此我們要研究新　石器時代的　史，及其一切　　民族社　關係，蘇聯方面的資料一定　有　　。</p>
<p>次之，在文　的史料方面，蘇聯的列寗格拉科學院上承帝俄時代努力之傳統，加上新的眼光及技術，對於新疆史料之綜合分析整理，必又達到某種成績，而爲吾人之所樂聞，而且蘇聯方面治學的觀點比較上要偏搬弄是非於社會學，經濟學，和政治學，也正好和西方之偏重於人類學，民族學，語言學作一對照。</p>
<p>又次，我們聽說新疆有許多手抄本的原始資料，目前都被收藏在烏孜伯克首都塔什子的博物館裏，供人展覽，據該國出版專門研究新疆維吾爾族文史的雜誌「東方眞理」所載，該項珍貴的中亞手抄本，竟達數萬卷之多，其中自然有極多是新疆的無名史家的成績，關於這一種情形，我們衹能怪過去中國官吏的愚蠢頑固與無知，而不能怪蘇聯學者之擅自取用。因爲就新疆文明必須世界的童言立場去看，就　用誰家保管都無所謂。</p>
<p>六·結論</p>
<p>綜觀中國，與蘇聯各種史觀本身之進化歷程，我們到此可以作一結論：即是世界文明之演進，促成各種原始孤立文明本身之演進，這種演進到科學時代之今日，又促成他們的史觀必須要走上現代化與世界化的道路，但其結果則由於傳統環境之不同，而產生不同觀點及內容的中國—回教諸國，西方諸國，及蘇聯的綜合成績，彼此到今日仍然不能融洽，因此一部新疆通史也就無從說起，除非我們惡意僅僅要據一些還是不脫主觀的結論：如中國方面的邊　地理學形太的綜合，回教土爾其國家史形態的綜合，西方文化史形態的綜合，與蘇聯的社會史形態的綜合，或是以一種形態爲主而參與一二　種其他形態　及資料的綜合。</p>
<p>我們建議即在那些麗於過去的道光年間的邊徼學派，土爾其的民族學派，西方資本主義性的文化學派，蘇聯革命性的社會學派的滾滾征　之後，加外發起一種新疆歷史的最後綜合運動，而以全人類文明進化之大道，一以貫之，這就是知識權力蕭鼓奏兮的進軍，無形之中，可以　　去腐，可以轉移風氣，可以旋轉乾坤！我誠敬地祝　海內高明的學者能以科學與民主的精神，依國際文化合作的方式建立之，我更　請全國有志的靑年，能以拓荒者的決心，在風沙烈日下奮鬥。</p>
<p>要之，以新疆現狀講，就是從實地去研究新疆文史，人皆導流，我獨溯源，然後源在握，而流益壯，終成汪洋之大流，可以兼容並蓄，與天地齊壽，目前走這條路的人，據我　得也不算少，如李帆羣以一年功夫，單騎環　繞塔克拉馬干大戈壁一週，著成五十萬言的一部巨著，可是無力出版，如擅長哈語的　桂森從祁連山到天山逐個賬幕去採訪遊牧民族的資料，如　北海深入牧地衷去和哈族學者探討歷史；如慕地依之多年致力突厥語文；如哈吉牙合甫的專　考據史料，如倪　　對於自己民族（哈族）史所持之科學態度；如莫罕默德，　　，鮑爾　，劉效　，迪迓　　等對於治史的孜孜不倦，提　　進，再如靑年史家劉克　之殉身沙　，　家　樂然之　　　航，在　家齊　的熱閙　氣中，帶上那一點悲凉的　　，這一點　　，雄壯的風　，都足以　起　　　　　　的精神。　（完）</p>

<h3>德賠償問題僵持　外長會成敗繫於蘇態度　莫洛托夫向政府請示中</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十四日電〕外長會議週五之會議在警風駭浪中結束後，本屆外長會議之命運顯然已在　搖之中，莫洛托夫利用外表長公之休會期間，已急意莫斯科請示，此乃一重受之先驟。蓋就過去數日之發展觀，克林姆宮近來對莫洛托夫之訓令，顯然為否定性質。莫洛托夫在週五會議中之作風，使會議不得不鄭重考慮短時間之休會，除非馬　爾踵意任莫洛托夫閃避賠儅問題，則逕行討論議程之其他項目，亦殊無益。然從一切指示觀，馬歇爾殊不願　莫洛托夫閃避此一重大問題。則逕行討論議程之其他項目，亦殊無益。然從一切指示觀，馬歇爾殊不願　任莫洛托夫閃避此一重大問題。馬歇爾在週五之會中，故憲重申美國立塲，設明經濟統一之協定，包括充分解決賠償問題及自各區移運德物資之問題，乃任何政治解決之條件，因此除百莫洛托夫能於週一之會議中提出處理賠償問題之方式，則外長會議至少在目前將陷入僵特局面。預料外長會議陷入僵局以後，在德國之下一步驟將為韋固現存之各區經濟機構，馬歇爾貝文在週五之會中，已表示在此種局勢之下，英美區合併協定將繼續執行，但將保持門戶之開放，　時進備他强之參國，以最後建立德國經濟之統一。莫洛托夫週五之演說，雖極盡指責之能事，然　亦未表亦願在完成議程其他事項之討論前，即使會議体會。　於週一若拒絕將賠償問題導入更具體的階段，或接受英美之意見，承認若不解決賠　問題，繼續討論亦屬徒然，則外長會議或不免進入類似一九四五年第一屆外長會議最後一週之狀態。當曉中國及西方强國堅決絕蘇聯之程序方面的意見，莫洛托夫在最後一週內，逐日提出新類建議，以示世人以會議之失敗不能歸咎蘇聯。近來蘇聯之宣傳已開始預光為莫洛托夫及其代表團解脫造成本屆外長會失敗之責任。於托値得重視者，乃為蘇聯「消息報」之言論，該報暗示本屆外長會之結果，有賴於四外長在會外所採取之政策。</p>
<h3>美蘇關係陰影日深　遠東問題難望協調</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十四日合衆電〕美蘇關係如仍循目前趨勢而突然急遽之轉變，則蘇美間之「假戰」於今後數月中即可益趨緊張之可能。一般人士言及蘇美在全世界政治經濟及意識形態方面之爭持，通常均稱之為「假戰」，然此一名詞，問或不能說明其實際情形。最近種種發展，使此間負責人士恐懼蘇美關係不久可能在東方朝鮮中國及日本三方面益趨緊張。</p>
<p>蘇方辛辣指　聯合國朝鮮委會乃美國之工具，該委會現定於明年一月初旬飛往漢城，聞如蘇聯拒其進入北　，該委會即在南韓執行其任務。美官員顯然相信在南韓建立之政府，今後與北韓之統一爭持中將有撑持之力。另一方面，蘇聯亦顯然相信其所培植之共產主義力量，可使北韓於所有美蘇駐軍撤退後，管治整個朝鮮，不論孰是孰非孰勝孰幾，此間甚多負責方面人士終恐美蘇關係將益趨惡化。美共和黨操從之國會，有意確使中國獲大量經濟援助，以協助國府坻禦共產主義，此種心理亦可望為促成美蘇關係再趨緊張之另一因素。至於日本方面，則閏蘇兩國分歧之點，即在對日和約如何簽訂，如何管制日本等。總之，兩國布世界一般問題之爭執陰影日深，在遠東方面兩國關係之緊張亦將與日俱烈。</p>

<h3>指揮飛行重要機構　空中管制站　任何一架飛機動靜完全清楚　任何一種空中事變立刻覺祭</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕能華機塲中有一間小小平房，室內裝有機架無綫電通訊的工具，壁上滿掛着地圖與記錄板，十機位穿空軍制服的靑年忙碌地工作着。這小小的間屋子，這少少的十來位工作者，却控制住整個中國天空的飛行交通，任何一架飛機的動靜位置，他們完全清楚；任何一種可能發生的空中事變，他們立刻可以覺察。這一個雖小而重要的機構就是交通部民航局的空中管制站。</p>
<p>空中交通管制在中國還是一種剛剛開始在做的工作，對於大多數人猶為陌生的名詞，但隨着航空事業的日益發展，航空時代的來臨，乃為迅速而必然之事。所以，空中交通管制的重要，猶如今日南京路上紅綠燈控交通一樣的不可缺少。</p>
<p>所謂空中管制究竟是怎麼一回事呢？以能華機塲為例，任何一架飛出去的飛機在起飛之前，先要塡一份飛行計劃表，送交管制站審查。計劃表中應塡明的包　飛機類別，飛機號碼，駕駛員·電報員姓名，電訊器日補類，飛行路綫，　飛時間，　計飛行時間，所載油量，軸助機塲他點等等。</p>
<p>觀察各地氣候　決定是否起飛</p>
<p>管制站根據這張計劃表詳細　查，對於油量及輔助機塲兩項尤為注重。大凡一架飛機所戴油量，除足够飛　目的地，以及萬一目的地不能降落而　飛至輔所機塲以外，尙須多備飛行一小時以上的油量，以備應付其他的突變。</p>
<p>計劃表各項通過以後，就要考慮氣候是否可以飛行。管制站所得氣候情報的來源有兩種，一種是天氣報告，由全國各地的中央氣象台和中國航空公司的各地氣象台供給，每半小時報吿一次。一種是天氣預測，由美海軍氣象台（共中一部份是從前的中美合作所氣象台）供給。每日報吿四次，包括風向雲高能見度等等。管制站就飛機飛行路綫所經各地的氣候作通盤觀察，根據規定的標凖，以決　該機是否可以飛行。</p>
<p>飛行准許書中　載明種種指示</p>
<p>一切「O·K」了，管制站始　　飛行准許書，這一架飛機就可以起飛。飛行准許書中並載明種種必要的指示，便如應在何種高度飛行或在何處將過某機之類。准許書並非直接交與駕駛員，而係交由機塲中的指揮搭用無綫電通知。</p>
<p>指揮搭負　的是半徑三英哩圈內的飛　進出，它用無綫電指揮飛機如何起飛，如何　免危險，並將准許書中批指示，亦用無綫電，通知駕駛員。，駕駛員聽到之後必須複述一遍，以遭免錯誤。</p>
<p>飛機旣已起飛，在離開指揮塔的控制範團以後，尙須與「近進管制台」聯絡，該台地點在江灣，目前因時制宜由美軍負責，其管制的範團為五十英哩。在此區域以內，任何飛機都要受它的指揮。</p>
<p>地圖記錄板上　位置瞭如指掌</p>
<p>五十英哩以外，巳區　上海區域。驚駛員根　管制站　　示向目的鍾前進，　　出電報與電報　電台聯絡，報吿書飛行位置及沿運氣候。每經過一站都康該發電報報吿　　及　計何時可以　違下一站。民報局電台接到比項報吿，即以電　打　或其他　迅捷方法，通知管制站，管制站的値勤人員就在記　板上註明。知果一架飛機超過了相當時間　沒有電報柏來，可能它已發生了變故，管制站根據它最近一次電報所報吿的位置，可以推測它失事的大約他點而作種種必要措施。</p>
<p>以上所說的都是以自上海飛出的飛機為例。反之，從各地飛來的飛機，其情形亦完全粗同。所以在管制站的記錄與地圖上隨時可以說出某一架飛機飛行在某一個空區，隨時可以知道全中國上空有多少飛機在飛行。</p>
<p>大部工作人員　在美實習多時</p>
<p>交通管制站目前已成立的還祇有上海一處，民航局原定計劃在上海，漢口，廣州，北平，西安，昆明，重慶，　陽設立八處，但因器材缺乏，後四處祇好暫綏，漢口，廣州，北平三地的管制站則在景知期內就可成立了。</p>
<p>上海站中的空中管制工作人員，現有二十八人，大部份都是在美國民航局實習多時的空軍人員，其餘則為交大淸華等畢業的工程學士。他們現在正在虹橋機塲設立一個空中管制訓練班，以訓練更多的專門人才來担負這重要的工作。希望在他們的努力之下，從此以後我們再也不會聽到或看到空中失事的悲劇！</p>

<h3>牌價與黑市相去甚遠　僑匯收入仍無起色</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕目前僑匯收入，因掛牌價格與黑市相去甚遠，仍無起色。據有關人士之估計，戰前我國每年之僑匯收入，可折合美金三億元，惟當時國際問對匯款並無限制，戰後形勢丕變，外匯統制之國家甚多，例如新加坡即規定每人每月之國外匯款不得超過四十五新幣，南洋其他各地，亦有類似之限制。據官方之估計，每年大約仍可達一億美元，但因走私之損失，國家之實際所得遠不及此數。</p>

<h3>香港日貨漸活躍　呢絨最受歡迎玻璃來價亦低</h3>
<p>〔港訊〕自從十一月間，英國和日本正式恢復貿易以後，香港的對日貿易，雖仍受兩地政府所控制，但最近較前已有顯著的發展。私人間的貿易普遍展開，若干商行已開始接受訂購日貨的合約。在雙方簽訂手續完畢，經過工商供應處徵得駐日盟軍總部同意後，日貨即可自日運港。在這種情形之下，輸入的日貨，並可獲得政府的外匯供給。</p>
<p>目前可以公開接受訂單的貨物，計有棉織品布疋，毛織品各種織料，絲織品富士絹，花綢，紙張，洋雜各項用品及玩具，化學染料，化學製品，玻璃，瓷器，文具用品，鋼筆，鉛筆，計算尺，海產等，種類極其繁複。上述各種商品，樣品均具備齊全，且有一定價格。其中最近選港暢銷者爲各種絨料，款式多至八十餘種，質料尙可，較佳者都被冒充英國貨發售。價格每碼僅售港幣十三元，旦係雙幅，故極受歡迎。來貨及時者均有三四分錢利潤。其次來價低而合算者，則爲玻璃。由於目前日貨價格，駐日盟單總部仍係規定以美元爲單位，同時係根據世界各地市價而決定，而可供訂購輸出的日貨，其中不能一律適宜於外銷，再加以來貨的洶湧關係，過去各方所訂購者，即時有　折。例如不久以前，有鉛筆一批運抵港埠，當訂貨時，香港鉛筆價每羅為二十元。該批日貨運港後，價即狂瀉，現在每羅跌到五元，還不易脫手。商人所受損失，由此可見。故目前各式日貨在港，雖可隨意訂購，唯一般商人均不願大量訂購。其中且多購買現貨而不願訂購期貨者，因恐訂購期貨後，隨時可能有大批現貨湧到，且對日本貨疑慮亦多，爲免招致意外損失起見，自不得不採取此項政策云。</p>
<p>最近抵港的沙遜爵士，對於整個香港對外貿易的前途，發表意見稱：「香港在戰後取得上海的地位，　而中國的紛亂，亦促進了香港的繁榮。華人不斷從北方來港，其對於香港的注意和投資，現正方興未艾。香港成為遠東主要轉口港埠，所有機會，甚為獨特。在戰後二年中，香港與遠東及西太平洋的貿易，進展程度頗足驚人，祗要看看出入口輪船及航空交通運輸數字，即可獲得明證。不僅如此，在中國的日前情况之下，將來英美及海外華僑資本，定必日漸南移，廣東與鄰近各省勢必逐漸繁榮，從而香港亦必受惠不淺。」</p>
<h3>七千萬元美棉貸欵　尚在接治談判中　國行顧問楊格已由滬飛美</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外傳美棉貸款美金七千萬元，將近成熟。記者曾向關係方面探詢，據悉：該項棉貸，刻尙在接洽談判中，係由美進出口銀行經手。惟該案尙須經美國務院最後通過，方能核貸。一般觀感，認爲希望甚濃·蓋該項貸款，期限不長，且係治定由我輸入貸款美棉，產製紡織品外銷後，以所得美匯，分期償付。聞中央銀行顧問楊格博士，十二日由滬飛美，與該項美棉貸款之談判，不無關係云。</p>
<h3>肥皂場外回鬆</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂市况，初開本街銷路尙活，門莊納意仍股，價仍俏俐。旋因價高，乘機出籠，市氣回軟。最後固本皂掛價九十九萬元，塲外價則較上日回跌三四萬元。箭刀皂一百零七萬有成交，黃祥茂七十五萬，牛牌亨利八十八萬，有人買進。光華皂七十八九萬有交易，火柴堅機，洋燭微挫萬元。</p>
<h3>許州薰菸葉　稅額再調整</h3>
<p>財政部上海貨物稅局，奉貨稅署電，以河南區第四期　菸葉稅額，業經據第二次調整爲甲級一，一四五，○○○元，乙級爲八七三，○○○元，丙級爲五四五，○○○元。嗣後上海區稅局補征許州需菸葉稅額，即此照該區甲級稅額一，一四五，○○○元計征。茲將本年度第四期第二次許州黨菸葉稅額自十二月十一日即行開始實施改征，計許州甲級　菸葉每百市斤自七九三，○○○元調整至一，一四五，○○○元。按　於棄稅額本年第四期第一次之調整，在十一月廿五日經已實施，計許州棄每百市斤自六四〇，○○○元調整至七九三，○○○元，　陽葉自三一五，○○○元調整至四二九，○○○元，靑州　自五○○，○○○元，調整至七二二·○○。十五日之問，甲級許州業之稅額，自六四○，○○○元，關整至一，一四五，○○○元，每百市斤達五十萬元云。</p>
<h3>擴充羊毛配額　通知尙未發出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：有關機關因目前羊毛之進口限額過小，僅敷實際需要之百分之十五，故決定將收購之自備外匯到埠貨物中，提出一百五十萬美元之羊毛，加入原定每季二可萬美金之進口限額中。惟此事雖經決定，正式通知則尙未發出。據此業中人吿記者：羊毛之國外價格，目前尙無波動，因澳洲所產之羊毛原大星供給母闕，但英國今日正在節衣縮食，勉渡難關，故需要最小。且目前正爲收成羊毛時期，供應最多，故售價穩定。但就長期趨勢而言，因澳洲羊之生產，戰後較之戰前爲少，故價格將日益昂貴。</p>
<h3>紗布掉換印棉　規定補充辦法</h3>

<h3>絲織業訂購意大利人造絲　四千餘箱日內抵滬　爲第三季限額輸人貨品</h3>
<p>據絲織業公會消息：意大利人造絲四千餘箱，日內即可港滬。該項人造絲爲第三季限額輸入貨品，係由絲織業所訂購，該業將按將各廠實際需要比例分配。據稱：該業自戰後以來，大部仰給於中信局對日易貨人造絲之配售，惟時斷　　，配量亦不敷需要。輸管會自第三季起，將人造絲列入輸入限額。規定數額為五十六萬五千美元，其餘由　帶業及人造絲商分配。又此次訂購之意大利造絲，係戰後最大之一批，過去僅有少量輸入云。</p>

<h3>科學之提高與普及</h3>
<p>— 屛溪</p>
<p>通常人們講到中國文化的落後，或社會進步的遲緩時，每舉出一項從未遺忘過的理由，說這是因爲中國科學的不發達，不够水準的緣故。其實這話應該這樣說：這是中國的科學不曾提高，不曾普及的緣故。</p>
<p>關於科學智識在建國復典大業上的需求，提高和普及是兩條康莊大道，不可偏廢，我們不能祗企望科學的提高，或只期待科學的普及，而必須同時從雙方面去完成此一迫切的任務，才算是問題的解決。</p>
<p>科學的提高和科學的普及，前者要着重專門人材的培養和特殊技術的訓練，後者要努力將一般科學知識，滲透到國民日常生活裏去。科學的提高，不只是國家的榮譽，同時也是對於世界學術有所貢獻；科學的普及，似與別的國家無甚關係，但爲提高國民知識程度，了解世界文化不可分割之意義上，自亦有其不可不力行的理由。這二者之間，不容分別先後，不容比較緩急，亦不能選擇輕重，必須同樣地被提出和同等地被注意。</p>
<p>從「五四運動」到現在快，三十年了，「科學」的呼聲，也曾被人喊得很響亮，可是成績是不能令人滿意的。說提高罷，我們有些什麼重要的發明或發現貢獻於世界呢？說到普及，我們的人民大衆與科學却仍舊是大多無緣。這都是由於我國政府和社會對於科學的努力不够。</p>
<p>科學的提高與普及，雖各有其任務與領域，然實一物而二面，因爲只有科學已經普及了的國家，科學才能有輝煌的成績；也只有科學已提高到了相當程度的國家，才能使他們的國民都普遍地接受科學的洗禮，旣無脫節之虞，亦看不出有什麽先後次第的痕跡。所以說科學的普及與提高，祗是一個綜合的課題，其發展的程度是互相配合着的。</p>
<p>爲什麽美國的科學能這樣的登峯造極呢？爲什麽他們能首先發掘「原子能」這一偉大的創舉呢？那就是因爲他們科學程度高，人才多，硏究深，和科學知識很普及了的緣故。在美國，差不多任何職業任何年齡的人們，都有了相當的科學認識和科學訓練，大都對於科學發生了與趣，因此從事科學工作的人也格外多，在多數的手腦活動下，真理自然易於被發掘了，科學也自然進步得很快了。</p>
<p>這說明了，科學的提高與科學的普及，必須是並進的，程度旣高，普及自易，唯能普及，方可提高，二者的關係，是相輔相成的。我國過去的科學工作迄未能雙方兼籌並顧地計劃過，以致進步滯緩，不能應時代的需求。</p>
<p>今後爲發展吾國科學計，提高與普及是不可徧廢的，造就高深的科學專門人才，必須先打好一個完善的科學社曾基礎；要使科學能在民間起普及的作用，必須將科學的浮標再提高一層。國家應該化費大宗的物力財力，來建立高深的，完美的硏究機關，然而也不能忽略那深入民間的灌輸科學工作。我們若用大部的力量去推廣一般人民的科學知識，但也不能就此忘懷了培植專門人材。這是一種敎育任務，更是科學工作者的責任。</p>
<h3>睡眠的科學</h3>
<p>— 郁</p>
<p>人類生命的過程中，當然以睡眠爲最重要。一個人缺不了睡眠，也不願意不睡眠，因爲睡眠對於人類恰有極大的好處與帮助，它能調劑精神，恢復腦力，使身心健康，這些都是睡眠的效能，所以睡眠就無可避免地被人們承認爲一種必要的事。</p>
<p>假使你願意作試驗的話，你就一整夜不上床去睡，當時你或許還不覺得怎麽樣，但是第二天，你就會感到頭軍，筋酸，四肢無力，昏昏沉沉的，眼睛也失去了神，好像是在你的頭上壓了一樣東西似的，終日精神不振，這麽看來，一陲眠是人類所不可缺少的事。</p>
<p>現在我們先看每人的睡眠時間，各各長短不同，大概幼童在二歲以下的，普通超過十五小時，三歲至六歲在十小時以上，六歲以上的，大約在十小時左右，成年人則可以减至八小時，年老的更减少至六小時，七十歲以上的睡了五小時已很足够了。所以我們得到一個結論，就是人類睡眠時間的多寡，是與年齡成反比</p>
<p>但是又爲什麼年齡增大，就可以减少睡眠時間呢？那又爲什麽不完全廢了它不睡呢？按理論，確可成立。不過事實上又不然，所以問題就來了，睡眠對於人類究竟是不是必要的。</p>
<p>據美國華盛頓大學馬司敎授（Prof.　Frde　A.　Mass）以男女學生八人作實驗，繼續六十小時不睡，但是他們的工作效率及身體的健康，都沒有絲毫减退。</p>
<p>由上述的實驗，雖然不能够確定睡眠是可以廢除的，但是至少可以推知睡眠爲一種習慣，並不是人類所必需的。還有其他許多科學家，認爲睡眠是人類祖先所養成的習慣，後來就把這個習慣漸漸的遺傳給後代的我們，至一種不可更改的程度。</p>
<p>然而我們將睡眠時間一天一天盡量地减少，那末終有一天那天可以整夜不入睡。這事並不是不可能，祇是吾人不去實行罷了。上面我們已經知道成年人的睡眠時間爲八小時，假使我們能上床即入睡，以及廢除一切不必要的荒廢時間，那末睡眠時問，就可以减少至六小時，這樣不就是比平常少了二小時，但春效力却不减於八小時。</p>
<p>美國哥侖比亞大學心理學敎授何林烏（D.H.L.Hollinworth）說，廢除睡眠是極可能的。他並且有一個方法，就是睡八小時的人，如果每月以五分鐘短時間的依次减少，在十六年後，即可完全除掉，因爲每月减以五分鐘那麽短的時間，是不被一般人所覺到有什麼妨碍的。</p>
<p>睡眠實爲人類之第一大悲事，因爲它不特剝奪你的自由，而且還荒費了你最愛惜而寶貴的時光，我們如以一個四十歲的人來計算，那末他已把十數年的好時光棄去於黑暗之鄉，　不可惜，甚至可痛。</p>
<p>那末我們的祖先又是怎樣養成這種惡習慣的呢？這是因為上古時科學當然談不到，但是又沒有火的發現，所以一切都得靠藉日光的照明，才可開始他們的工作，黑夜中他們當然不能繼續下去，然而又沒有一點事情可做，因為那時生活極簡單，於是就昏昏然的將身子躺下來，久而久之，遂形成了一種睡眠狀態。他們繼續這種狀態，直至炎的發現，但是那時已經成了習慣不可更改，他們也就不去改他，因為那時的人根本就沒有知道睡眠是一種習慣，於是這種惡習遺傳下來，一直到現在。</p>
<p>還有許多科學家，認爲欲硏究替代睡眠，其最主要的就是恢復腦細胞的活動力，如此人們不再須要藉睡眠以恢復他們的腦力</p>
<p>腦細胞是一種復雜的結合機構，人類的一切為它所主宰，所以恢復了腦細胞，就是恢復了整個人，假使吾人能够發明一種機械，藉此種機械之作用，或者用電流使腦細胞起變化，而回復原來的狀態，如此睡眠就不需要了</p>
<p>到那時，「睡眠」二字將成為歷史上的陳蹟，而生命也就被憑空的拉長了一半，一個三歲孩子就可以送他進學校去讀書，一個十歲的人就有成年人一般的閱歷與經驗，床則成為吾人片時休息之所了。</p>
<p>編者按：睡眠是一種自然的生理現象，疲勞的恢復，全靠睡眠。將來能不能因爲科學的進步，而有法免除，到是一個很有趣的問題，且有若干事實根據，特爲刋</p>

<p>無綫電影在美國中上級家庭可以說是很普通的了，但是彩色的無綫電影最近方才公開　實成功。美國無綫電公司（RCA）因此特地製就一副新式電視照相機，用以廣播全真自然色彩無綫無綫電影，該機係全部電于管設備，光綫先聚焦在照片上，然後分成三色，攝入鏡頭，以高速的電干掃描　無綠三色，所以每秒每色能够掃描三十次。接收機便將該三色重又合成全震天然色彩。普通黑白無錢電影接收機如裝一換流機，亦能接收該種未來的彩色電影，但色彩仍僅黑白兩色而已。所以未來之彩色無綫電影之普遍應用，據該公司高級職員聲稱，猶待相當時日云。</p>
<h3>木材漫談</h3>
<p>— 唐燿</p>
<p>硬材類的木材，還有一類特殊的管狀細胞，呌做「木織維」（WoodFiber）在多數硬材中，木織維是主要的部分。這些纖維的功用，是以力學的支持爲主，它的長度，平均約一耗（1/25吋）。木織維的紋孔，有多種的不同，也可有多種專門的名詞，來形容它。大體說起來，它們的結構是介於上面所述的「管胞」與下面所談到的「木薄膜組織」之間。</p>
<p>以上所談到的木材細胞，都是沿樹木縱軸排列的，還有一類的木細胞，是很短的管狀細胞，呌做「木質線薄膜組織」（Wood　Ray　Parenchyma）。它們的長軸是延木材的徑向（即延橫面半徑的方向）排列。它們的鄰壁間有單紋孔；此等細胞，仍有生機，以儲藏食物爲主。若是薄膜組織的細胞，它們的長軸也是軸向排列，那就稱爲木薄膜組織（Wood　Parenchyma，）。這兩種組織，完全是因爲細胞排列的方向不同，但不可不分別淸楚。</p>
<p>各種木材的結構，大別可以分爲兩型：就是「軟木類」，以管胞爲主體，此等細胞，旣司傳導（早材或春材部分），又兼支持（遲材或秋材部分）；到了「硬木類」，則分功較精；導管（橫切面稱管孔　Pore）專門適于輸導，纖維則以力學之支持爲主。至于薄膜組織（包括木薄膜組織及木質線），均以儲藏食物爲主。</p>
<p>木材內橫列的組織，是延着木材的徑向（即橫斷面上延直徑之方向）排列，所以木材組織的對稱性，僅由三個：就是1橫切面（Cross　or　TangentialSection），指與主幹或中軸成直角之面；2徑切面（　RadialSectino），指切面之可含木材中心之髓（Pith）者；3弦切面（Tangential　Sectino）指切面之與生長輪成直角者，或與髓成平行者。木材內的各種細胞旣然是立體的，因此要觀察到任何一種木材的結構，看到細胞壁縱橫高三方面，非得把這木材依照橫切縱切（包括徑切弦切）等三方面所得到的結果，聯合起來，不能得其全貌·上面所述徑向排列的木材線（WoodRay），在木材的橫切面上看，是放射形；倘若把樹皮剝開，有時可以看得出這些線的高度；在徑切而上（就是延木段中心鋸開），是許多帶狀細胞（Tibbon-like）的集合體蹤列的管狀細胞，在木材橫切面，僅僅看到這些管子的橫面（Cross　Surface），同徑壁及弦壁（Radial　and　Tangential　Wall）（因爲切開的部分不一樣，同一細胞的大小，在橫切面上可以不同）。必須聯合起徑切面及弦切面，才可以明白全部胞壁上的結構。</p>
<p>木段鋸板的方法，可以大別爲二式：1弦鋸板（Flator　slash　sawn　oi　glat　grain，指木段弦面或與半徑成直角之方向鋸成板狀者。２徑鋸板（Quarter　or　fift　sawn，指木段沿徑面，或近于木材線之方向，鋸成板狀者。此兩種鋸板法，雖不能究全正確；因炫鋸之板，由外而內，漸近于徑，至延中心部分，即成爲徑鋸。大槪說起來，在板之　面，與生長輪小于15度者，仍稱弦鋸板，反之得稱徑鋸板。木材鋸板之法，不但影響於人工及材料，同性質及美觀上都有關係·譬如　木甚其寬之木質綫，在延徑鋸之面，始可現出美麗之銀色光澤·其次木段因鋸板之方法不同，與木材收縮的關係亦很大。同樣寬度之木板，在弦鋸時，乾後的收縮，可較徑鋸時約大一倍。譬如某種　木，經弦鋸者濕時寬8.6公分，乾後縮爲7.9公分，收縮率爲8％；同樣寬度的木板，若係徑鋸者，乾後爲8.1公分，收縮率爲5％（原因詳木材之收縮）。此外，木材因為是弦面或徑面，也影響他的性質；如木材的力　抗强，在延縱向橫向（包括徑面弦面），亦大有差異。即此可見木材的性質，與細胞排列的方向，實大有關係。</p>
<p>結論：　木材是有機體，須數十百年始可成熟。在它攸久的生長季節，日日年年，無時不受到外界的影響，因此各種樹木的木材，是極實於　異性。譬如有關用途重量紋理顏色等，莫不如此。　各種木材，都是細胞狀的結構物（Cellular　structure），它們的組成與排列，有種種的不同，所以各種木材，有各種的結構。一種木材的好藝，多半要看它的性質如何。可是木材的材性，多半由於木材結構上及物理化學上之不同，所以把各種木材看做材料（Material，到不如把木材看做一種結構（Strucnur。）來得確當。（續完）</p>

<h3>華盛頓挨駡</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>華盛頓於第二任總統任滿吿老選鄕之際，有一報紙著論痛駡，其言曰：「現在才是興高彩烈拍手稱快的時候了—凡與人民之自由幸社息息相關之人，此刻應該心花怒放，因為而今而後，華盛頓這個大名不再散佈政治腐敗與公認貪汚無能了。」</p>
<p>在此以前，華盛頓早給異黨駡得要命，禁不住口出怨言：「他們駡得我狗血噴頭駡流氓　三剪綹小偸也不是這樣駡法的。」</p>
<p>大家知道華盛頓是美國革命元勛之一，盡瘁國事多年，勳業彪炳，誰知道常他任滿吿退之日，竟有堂堂報紙以他的「滾蛋」為人民之目由幸福稱慶。可見無論什麼人物，一時毀譽在所在免，是非功罪究竟如何，實非蓋棺之後不能論定；不，甚至蓋棺之後也難論定。</p>
<p>而且人物愈大，挨駡之機會愈多。譬如當我僅有一個孩子而他又只有三歲時，我就極獲他的受戴，每當問他「爸好不好」，他的回答一定是「好！爸好！好爸爸！現在這孩子已經十三歲，弟妹成羣，我就不敢再以「爸好不好」相詢，有時乘機一間，十九笑而不答。這不能怪他，一則我再不能滿足他的欲望，即使物價不漲，我的收入不减，買來一包水果糖他也至多只能得到五分之一，不能如三歲那時候的一人　得；再則我對於他的學業品行不覺日關心，難免時有勸導，他就受不大了，因為我的諄諄之言，在他也許認為瞎三話四。而且事實上不但他慢慢的不敬，連小的機個孩子也何嘗對我一致擁護。這也難怪他們，因為一方面我以養育管敎他們為已任，一方面對於他們的需要在頗難盡責。因此我頓悟要做一個好爸爸，決不能多生兒女，因此我深感家且難齊，遼論治國了。</p>
<p>大人物必大挨　的原因之二，是無論那個夫人物很難「衆望所歸」。我就當想我與希特勤或墨索尼的本領一定不相上下，因為我如做了第三德國元首，或穿了黑衣做今羅馬商國宰相，至不濟也不過弄得國破身亡罷了，還會有什麼比們更糟的！故我就看不起古往今來的大人物，我如此，世界上當然也有千萬人如此。不過我脾氣好，又謙遜為懷，故不駡大人物，更決不想取而代之。但倘有人一面與我同樣看不起大人物，一面却比我志高氣大，那就自然不免天下大亂了。</p>
<p>故大人物之挨駡是必然的。應付之法是：好，你駡得我够兇，那末，我讓你來做大人物，你讓人去駡。史稱華盛頓的不願競　第三任總統，就為的不願再挨臭駡，而他的後任約翰亞當，果然更給台下駡得要死云。</p>
<h3>生日</h3>
<p>— 吉爾</p>
<p>每天早上起身後，妻照例要間我吃些什麼菜，以便在中午做幾樣可目的菜肴，小餐一頓，這也算在目前過窮苦公務員生活下的一縣自慰，因為我可算是講究吃的信徒。今天妻忽然對我說用什麼菜下　，才恍然想着我的生日又到了。</p>
<p>眞的，不是妻　起，我是不會記得我的生日。我對生日素不關心，我想目下大多數人都有此同感吧，生日而必須吃　，不知是何根據，大約南方人平時多吃杜米，吃久了缺乏維他命B易患脚氣病，所以就借生日換換口味，這與我鄕每年陰歷六月六日的吃　，　飩，水餃筆或有同樣作用，但或許後者還含有夏令衛生，取其易於消化，亦不一定</p>
<p>生日而必依陰歷的日子，又不知何所根據。儘管現在陽歷早已明定為國歷，現在生的孩子，依國歷算生日也很方便，但　依國歷的日子而做生日的孩子又祗有幾個？有不少倒是陰陽二歷都計，那末這孩子有福了，可以做二個生日。</p>
<p>每逢生日，自然有人是開堂祝壽，大慶華誔，大大地　　一番的，也有人就呑蛋一枚，算是一年「滾」過。但若心情不佳，生活栗六，那就乾脆記記掉，生日也有等於無。凖此，則我的有人提醒，還算是運的了。</p>
<p>有種人逢生日就吃素，如吃　亦吃素　，說該日是「母難日」，吃素所以「報娘恩」。雖然是有點釋氏思想，倒也言之成理。現在的人與父母的關係，恐怕大部份只是錢的關係，倘能够一年一度用心記記，為母親吃一天素，那倒很有意思。等到人人能依國歷計算生日，人人能將生日呑作是「母以人日」的時候，也許天下就可太平了。</p>
<h3>越人談酒</h3>
<p>— 亦存</p>
<p>平公寫飲酒篇（六日自由談），可以說是「酒逢知已」了，為之　大白！的確，酒在由陰道上，是一個很重要的因子，不過刼後的山陰，却不如理想或憧憬中的美好。八載　獄，不但樹木被砍得由不成「陰」，就是「這」路也破壞得難以涉足；差堪慰的，僅有這釀酒事業，在一天一天復興起來。</p>
<p>紹興不愧是個酒鄕，不但每一個鄕村有人釀酒，而且十有六七的農戶都有家釀，釀酒多的到幾千缸，少的一缽頭也可以釀得。黃酒不一定紹興可釀，偈蘇州和其他好些地方，也有很多紹興人在設坊釀造，可是總不及紹興的產品為佳，其原因是在乎天然的水。鑑湖依由蜿蜒三十里，清澈甘肥到異常，釀酒的水，都取諸鑑湖，但也限於幾個地段才有用，據試驗結果，兩地取同樣容時的水來過磅，在重量上要相差好些，這大槪是某幾個溪流含有礦質之故。</p>
<p>紹興產酒著名的有三太處，就是阮社（際籍的故鄕），東浦，和湖塘。那襄有無數酒坊，每當初春煎酒時期，空氣中充滿酒香，使人呼吸了就有點黨黨然之感。</p>
<p>論出品，外地人只知「京裝」和「花彫」。其實不能算最好。在紹興有的是「竹葉靑」（不加　色的純酒），「趕陳」（新酒加上　色），「狀元紅」（陳酒），「加飯」（原料加重的一種）等，這些是普通的；較好的是「善釀」（用酒代水的再釀酒），「福橋酒」，以及非　品專用以送禮或　紀念的特釀。陳酒有陳到幾十年，已變成清水那樣的東西；更有一種以燒酒當水重料釀成的「酒雪」，淺碧甘醇，一標醉倒，那更是酒鄕中人難得到的珍品。</p>
<p>論飲酒，倒不因是產地而便善飲，無非是比較普遍一而已。有很多的酒坊主人是涓滴在飲的，農工們一天喝四五次，在他們已成為恢復疲勞的藥品。有很多自朝到晚只喝酒，少吃飯，長酸不醒的，雅號是「醉暇」；至於可稱「牛飲」的，好要算酒坊中的工人了，他們忙碌感到口喝，飢俄，或疲勞時，便在隨便那一缸裏浸下頭去咽咽一通，用不到下酒品，袖子抹抹嘴臉，及去工作，這個呌做「照大鏡」。</p>
<p>最後說買酒。山陰道上是到處不用愁的，價錢又便宜，可是買不到好酒，因為這裏買酒的　頭全靠在　水（喝的人慣了是不以為奇的），要買好酒得用點心思。「那家好」？「那家新開　」？紹興人都如此相問。到麼到山陰道上來「擁擠一番」的貴資們，更須「入境問俗」呢！</p>
<h3>頭髪辦認法</h3>
<p>— 禾止</p>
<p>人的面貌雖是不同，然辦認起來很多困難，所以有人發明手指的紋路來辦認。現在司法界頗採用此法，凡過盜賊和犯罪的人，呌他印一個手模，按照紋路種類，編成號目，記在簿上，凡是已犯過罪的只消把他的手模號目按簿查對，任憑他怎樣抵賴，怎樣化裝，也是無可逃避的了。</p>
<p>和指模有同等效力的便是頭髪。猛罪學專家，早巳採用這個辦認的方法，來輔助指模的不足，增加辦認的效用。按科學學的硏究，人們的頭髪，在極强的顯微鏡下君來，都有極細的鱗片，和魚鱗相似。髪的中心是空的，內有有色的物質。</p>
<p>據科學家說，頭髪的組織從沒有兩個人完全相同的。頭髪的辦認之點，在髪的粗細，中心管的大小，鱗片的大小，髪面的性質。司法界因此多了一個處理罪犯的工具。</p>
<h3>畫像</h3>
<p>— 天</p>
<p>女客：「誰呌你把我畫得這樣難看的？你看，這張畫像簡直是畫的一只大河馬！我不能付錢。」</p>
<p>畫家：「太太，你為甚麼不在呌我畫之前想一想呢？」</p>
<p>歡迎新疆歌舞訪問團　張一渠</p>
<p>一昨陰晴，承公展月笙寄　學禹諸公邀宴於江亞輪，歡迎新疆歌舞訪問團，甚盛事也，率成一律誌之。</p>
<p>黃浦江頭半日航，盛筵勝會不尋常：風清雲淡歌聲遠，海闊天空笑語凉；萍水相逢疑舊雨，河山無恙祝新疆，他年西出陽關地，便有故大共舉觴。</p>
<h3>論小不如意</h3>
<p>— 何苦</p>
<p>失意的人往往有一句成語掛在心頭，呌做「不如意事常八九」，未免把人生看得太悲觀一點。有百分之八十以上的不如意事，還能視是人定勝天嗎？譬如前面有兩條路：一條是快樂的路，一條是悲哀的，在你選擇的時候，當然你不會走悲哀的路。又如放在你前面的是兩碗湯，一碗是苦的藥汁，一碗是甜的牛奶，當然你歡喜喝牛奶。當我們在開始走路或喝湯的時候，就已經決定了揀歡喜的，如意的事物着手，則「不如意事常八九」的成語，是不成立的，因為人們決不會先揀不如意的事做，除非這個人是白癡。</p>
<p>然而在你的生活中多少會遇到一些小不如意的事情，無可避免地在追　着你，使你感到煩惱，發生憂慮，你或許把　在口袋裏的一枝自來水筆，不愼在上公共汽車的時候給聶手暗暗偸了去；或許在你興高彩烈持　　菊之餘，感到自己的肚子已經吃壞，因而瀉了一夜；或許你把一件心愛的禮物，托人送給遠人的時候，被託帶者中途遺失於旅次……凡此等等，都屬人生小不如意的一類事，無可避免，雖是不致使你感到劇烈的懊喪，其情形正類被黃蜂之一刺，有點疼痛，有點腫脹，但決不會損害你整個的健康一樣。</p>
<p>據說這是人生的波折。一帆風順的理想境界，往往難以遠到，一定要有一點波折，而波折也就是經騐，使你的生活更其可以圓滿與如意——你一定要在第一枝鋼筆失落，買進了第二枝時才懂得「惜物」眞正的意義；一定要在第一次吃蟹鬧肚子以後，才知道怎樣去細嚼和飲食的適可而止。可恨的是人生經騐的累積果然很多，然而新奇的的遭遇更多，因為麈務之繁複，更求不到一個經騐的「常數」，可以適用於種種遭遇，因此小不如意的事是不一見而屢見了。</p>
<p>今天妻很高興地為我賣了兩磅絨綫，預備為我做一件絨衫，結果忘記在三輪車上沒有帶回，因而感到懊惱。我只有用上面的意思去安慰她。</p>
<p>新春的頌語中，有一句是「萬事如意」，眞正能有如意的萬事嗎？此所以頌語之終為頌語而已，鳴呼。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第三章　台上與台下　（一五）</p>
<p>得到五點下班時候，渚齋才下了決定，旣然答應，便應前去，僱車到華北番菜館，一路上心裏打疊許多話，預備見面時好應付。不想到華北番菜館時，綺紈早在雅座內等候，一見面祗笑道：「你眞忙，我來了好一會了。你今天早上，為什麼不上我家去？」渚齋正要支吾，接着綺紈又問道：「昨晚坐的靠東邊那位就是你的太太嗎？」渚齋心頭和打鼓一般，深怕她質問，很忸怩道：「是的，她平日不大出門，是一位舊式太太，外面一切塲面全不知道。昨晚因為你吩咐呌她去，我才把她拉出。」綺紈道：「我理想你的太太一定很漂亮，很美匯的，想借此機會見見。」渚齋道：「什麼漂亮：她連一點常識都沒有，太不懂事了」。渚齋說這幾句，意在解釋鳳笙昨晚失言之過，不想綺紈聽了，轉眉頭一縐，把頭微微一搖道：「天下事眞是沒有閏滿的，這也是你一種遺憾。當日怎麼會識她」？渚齋道：「她是我姨母第三女兒，當日和我提親的，是她的大姊姊，並不是她。她的大姊受過相當敎育，人極活潑，長的也漂亮，後來到上海讀書，突然變卦，跟別人走了。她父親因為我們親事，親友都知道，傳出去不大好聽，想把他第三女兒，就是現在我的太太嫁給我，我當我不願意，却是我父親一力主張。我為這事，反對過幾次，曾一度避到濟南，給我叔叔勸回來，說我再反對，要把父親氣死，我為家庭壓力所迫，終於屈伏了。」綺紈點點頭，很感慨道：「中國這種舊禮敎觀念，如果再打破，眞是誤人不淺！，你的婚姻遭遇。和我的父親一樣。我父親原聘定我大姨母，後來我大姨母出走，我外祖母為顧全體面，把我母親充當大姨母嫁過來，後來我父親知道，對我母親就沒好感，動不動就借題發揮。我母親有了詵兒女，為了這個芥蒂，我父親仍是不斷和母親生氣。夫婦之間，始終不能和睦，氣得我母親不願和父親在一起，終年避到上海，信佛念經，到老感情，還不能融洽。這樣一來，我們做兒女的，在家庭之間，太為難了」！渚齋聽了，大有同病相憐之槪，默默地心上祗是難過，　着杯中剩餘的白蘭地，一時什麼話也不好出口，接着綺紈又說道：「今天我聽你這一番話，大有同感，希望你不要像我父親那樣脾氣。我母親的遭遇是很可憐的」！渚齋聽了，默然不語。</p>
<h3>談石家莊</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>自從石家莊警訊傳到平律，半月以來，華北一帶，顯著的變態是物價猛漲，金鈔黑市猖獗，謠言多。一般人張口「石門！」閉口「石門！」實在有些張皇達度。究竟石門於華北大局居何地位，有何關係，他們並無系統硏究，而祇是無意識的徬徨。</p>
<p>石家莊雖屬於獲鹿縣而近依正定（在正定之正南不足二十里，西距獲鹿則四五十里），舊時雖相當　鬧，不過地方性質之大村鎭，雖當北京到武漢之　路，而正站在正定，次站在欒城，界「正」「樂」兩者之間只一站相距僅六十里，石莊介乎其間，不過「茶尖」小憇之地，無人注意。淸代建設京漢（平漢）鐵路，乃沿舊驛路而造成。石莊是由正定南下之一小站，惟對於西路，則此莊恰當娘子關之正東，自正太鐵路成面頓形重要。蓋正定至石莊一段，仍是平漢綫，自石莊以西而獲鹿，而非陘，而娘子關，以達太原，故所謂「正太」實即「石太」。「石太」與「平漢」成「丁」字形，石莊在交叉點，為晋冀煤運之中心站。</p>
<p>石莊與大局關係之印象，發生於辛亥之冬，武漢革命軍起，吳祿責屯兵此，阻淸軍之南下，又與　州張紹曾相呼應，誠所謂綰　中樞，舉足輕重。袁世凱遺人刺殺吳氏，而後第三鎭之兵得以長驅攻入娘子關。被時石家莊在軍事上之重要，無與倫比。此地名乃漸為世所熟知。</p>
<p>北平向南兩大幹綫，一津浦一平漢，皆蜿蜒數千里，形若平行，中間需要一橫貫之聯絡綫，是以前淸之郵傳部即有建造「滄石路」之預計。（津浦綫之滄州西行至石莊），後因蘇北之　海路已性徐州鄭州，故而延　。直至「九一八」事變後，日寇向華北侵略，以把握鐵路為控制北五省之「國策」，値　察政委會成立，標榜經濟合作，第一重大要求，即建造滄有鐵路。宋哲元氏雖百般敷衍，獨於此事堅持不可，避居樂陵，「七七」事變於以爆發。</p>
<p>華北淪陷，僞「臨時政府」成立，敵方則由其南滿鐵路一般怪物，設立所謂「華北交通株式會社」，立時著手建築「德石鐵路」「滄石」之變更為「德石」的原因，是德州在由東之北與河北省交界，在滄州之南三百八十里，津浦綫上更為衝要，且南行二百餘里即是濟南，銜接膠濟鐵路，以　靑島海口，至為便捷。</p>
<p>日人之所以亟亟於此之目的，仍以經濟為主，蓋石莊之西鄰即河北著名之井陘煤礦，再西則由西之白烟煤，炸子煤，而濟南以東之淄博煤礦鐵礦，皆聯為一氣，華北資源，全盤在握，數十年之野心，如願以償，不料惡貫滿盈，八年之後，全面投降，聯喪所有。中國接收後，「共」字號的人們又繼之而起，其日的則在破壞。兩年以來，節節而拆之，段段而毀之，日人全力經營之德石路，固體無完國，即多年老幹綫之平漢路亦狼藉不堪。先則石家莊與保定軍不駝，繼則北平與保定間亦仗飛機往來，所謂四通八達綰　中傴的石門，早已成為預露無依，四肢皆斷的一朶「光桿牡旦」。前之守者旣不能保持，則現在之得而據之者，又焉能用作進攻他處之根據地！</p>
<p>可笑的是平津一帶「神經」論者，動色相吿，不是輿對方得此，西可入晋，北可攻保，東可如何，南可如何，就是說，保定已失屛障，岌岌可危。這些冬烘頭腦，刻板的議論，可謂全無意識。此種揣測，若在吳祿貞時代，還有可說，因為那時的鐵路是完整的，戰爭是直綫的，吳氏據石莊則北攻保，西取晋，是可能的。而今之對方一向用的游擊戰術，散漫的多方面的陣勢，並不須先占了石莊面後進攻保定。况石莊未失以前，保定四周早巴時時作攻防戰了，平保的車早已不通了，那與石莊孤城之得失，有何關係？而且有莊南北東西鐵路公路，早巴被他們毀滅，則此時又　能有現成的交通工具，供其運輸！故石莊之得失，在近兩年中（即四面交通已斷之後），任何方面皆無決定性的勝負可言。</p>
<p>然石莊之失，刺激一般人的神經，亦自有其故。因石莊經日　仝力經營數年，已成現代化之大都市，工廠，報館，商塲，機塲，戲院，公署，學校，銀行，皆是新式建築。以彼榨取之資財，使市街寬整，樓閣宏滙，四方商賈雲集，假繁榮的氣　萬千。平津之名伶亦常往應演，各大商號派設分號者絡經不絕。往年河北省都市以「平津保」為「三大」，而今以北平為中心，東路則天津仍居首位，次則唐山，西路則石莊居首，保定反在其下。平漢綫上惟一之大都市，一旦失守，又據說受了砲火圍攻之洗禮，而成為廢墟，此種消息刺激北方羣衆神經，自與其他一城一邑之攻防出入者不同，亦　當然。</p>
<p>然而事實上在對方策略，只算是一種神經的攻勢。若看作吳祿貞時代之石莊而作北可以進取某地，西可以攻略某地，東可以怎樣，南可以怎樣之史論家之常套，則完全不合現實的事態之冬烘學究的論式矣。</p>
<p>試取傳作義去年收復張家口，作一反證。其所以右軍略上之重大關係，乃因　　由歸綏東進，一向是「穏打穏紥」，以綫形進取之姿輦，而　以進一步建設一步之主略。而其取得張壇之價値，並不在此一地之收　而是由此而安定了平綏鐵路，靈活了西北全面之脹胳而成高屋建　之優勢。換過來說，假使僅軍亦是散的游　戰，破壞的焦土戰，則此一地之佔領，亦不過一孤城廢墟，　能如現在之儼然薪的長城璧　乎？</p>

<p>[United Press International, Washington, 13th] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives agreed on the 13th on an emergency foreign aid bill, including the full $570 million requested by the government, and including aid to China. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated: This compromise aid bill will be submitted to the Senate for discussion on the 15th, and the House of Representatives may also approve it on the same day. The Senate had previously passed President Truman's requested total aid amount of $570 million, solely for France, Italy, and Austria. The House of Representatives subsequently reduced it by $7 million and stipulated that $60 million of the $590 million should be allocated to China. In addition to agreeing on the total amount to be allocated, the joint committee must also resolve several amendments, most of which were proposed by the House of Representatives. Vandenberg told reporters: After lengthy discussions, the senators agreed to include aid to China, and the allocation of funds to the four countries will be stipulated in a future appropriations bill. Fortunately, any funds received by China will necessarily be taken from the shares of the other three countries. Some senators originally believed that China should not be included in a special bill providing aid to Western Europe, but because the House of Representatives "opened the door," the Senate does not intend to "close it."</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives also agreed on the following points: Stipulating the end of March 1948 as the termination date for aid. The United States should preserve 150 million bushels of wheat and flour for the next year, unless President Truman deems it unnecessary on March 1st. Removing direct references to the Communist Party, communism, and the Soviet Union, but assistance may be terminated to any country that comes under the control of the Communist Party. Allowing the Commodity Credit Corporation established by the government to supply any surplus food, such as fruits, tomatoes, and some tobacco, in accordance with the relief plan. Cancelling the House's amendment to establish a special committee to oversee the foreign aid plan. Allowing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to allocate $150 million before the appropriations bill is passed so that the aid plan can begin.</p>
<h3>US to Sign Bilateral Agreements with Recipient Countries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] The US House Appropriations Committee is currently drafting a bill to obtain funds from the Treasury Department to implement the emergency aid program. Given that there is an unallocated $18 million under the relief bill after the end of UNRRA, it is very likely that this amount will be allocated to China under a future appropriations bill. In effect, this would reduce the amount China receives under the emergency aid bill, and this extra amount deducted would be given to the three European countries. The final bill authorizes the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to advance $150 million before congressional appropriations to implement the bill and stipulates March 31st of next year as the deadline, at which time these funds will no longer be bound by any restrictions. The United States will also sign bilateral agreements with each recipient country, specifically stipulating the conditions under which these countries receive relief and their commitment to abide by the terms of the agreement. These terms will be very similar to the existing terms of the relief agreement after the end of UNRRA. The $27.5 million under the UNRRA relief program for China is only in its initial stage, so it is estimated that this amount can help China through its difficult times before the State Department proposes an aid to China plan. This amount will not be deducted from future appropriations under the emergency aid program.</p>
<h3>Jian Guansan Discusses Impressions of Trip to the US: Rising Prices Will Cause Dollar Value to Decline</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Legislative member Jian Guansan, who went to the United States in early October for observation, has now returned to the country. He discussed his impressions of his trip to the US with reporters as follows: From 1939 to the end of September of this year, prices in the United States for things like food, clothing, housing, wages, coal, and lumber, have risen by an average of 99.9%. In the last three months of this year, they will rise by 10% compared to the same period last year. Prices for the whole year may rise by 15% to 20%. According to a report by the National Association of Manufacturers, the amount of currency in circulation in the United States is now three times that of 1939, while industrial production has only reached 70%. This difference is the main reason for rising prices in the United States. As for postwar aid to foreign countries, it is over $16.25 billion, and the credit expansion of bank loans totaling over $39 billion by the end of June this year is a secondary factor. Observing the current internal and external situation of the United States, these factors will not be easily eliminated for a while, so US prices will inevitably continue to rise in the future, and the value of the dollar will inevitably decline accordingly. Our country's speculators arbitrarily continue to raise the price of the US dollar, which is tantamount to burying one's head in the sand. Moreover, our country's economic situation is so difficult. If a few wealthy households and merchants remain deluded and still seek endless gain, there will be a time of common ruin. At that time, even those with millions of US dollars and gold will not be able to enjoy the pain of shared misfortune alone. Since US prices continue to rise, the prices of some items are even higher than in China. Moreover, China's light industries, such as shirts, socks, sheets, and handkerchiefs, as well as China's woolen textiles, are not inferior in quality to those of the United States, so why welcome foreign goods and despise domestic goods? In short, the United States has its strengths and its weaknesses. Our country's attitude toward the United States should be from the objective position of a critic, constantly studying its gains and losses, and pointing out its rights and wrongs. This will demonstrate our self-reliance and self-respect and gain the trust of the American people, otherwise it will only lead to the opposite result.</p>
<h3>Britain's Reply on the Peace Conference: We Are Considering Countermeasures</h3>

<h3>Will Public Servants' Salaries Based on Indexation Be Implemented? It Is Difficult to Predict</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The method of paying civil and military officials and teachers according to the cost of living index was originally scheduled to be implemented from January next year, and the adjustment principle was also discussed and decided by the salary adjustment committee convened by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. It has recently been heard that the department in charge of finance believes that if salaries are paid according to this method, the burden on the national treasury will be too heavy. According to Xu Kan, the national budget will increase greatly after the implementation of the adjustment method, so it is still difficult to predict whether this method can be implemented as scheduled. The Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council will raise it for discussion at this week's regular meeting.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The national general budget for the first half of the 37th year has been approved by the State Council. The principle of its compilation is based on the extension and calculation of November of the 36th year. According to the current expenses for November and December of the 36th year, it is calculated based on the original budget, regardless of grade, and the supplementary budget is combined, with an additional 80%. It is also learned that after the additional 80% for November and December, the national general budget has a total additional amount of 190.219292 billion yuan.</p>

The sleepers have been ordered from Canada and will be delivered one after another. The steel rails require 1.5 million US dollars, which has been guaranteed by the Central Bank in advance. Therefore, the road is expected to resume traffic in the second half of next year.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Postpones Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners; Allied Headquarters to File Protest; Number of Japanese Prisoners Detained by Soviets Reaches 700,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, United Press] Allied Headquarters will protest the Soviet Union's excuse of "climatic conditions" to announce that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in northern ports will be temporarily suspended until April next year. Allied Headquarters has also suggested sending icebreakers to clear the waterways so that prisoner repatriation ships can pass. In another protest against the Soviet Union's slow repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war, Allied Headquarters sent a letter to Kesslinko, head of the Soviet delegation, pointing out that in the same months of 1946, the Soviet Union had repatriated 22,000 prisoners of war from the same two ports: Nakhodka in Siberia and Zhengang in Sakhalin. The Allied Headquarters' suggestion to send icebreakers was not accepted, so it suggested that the Soviet side could repatriate prisoners of war from warmer seaports. The letter also stated: "The Supreme Command of the Allied Forces is prepared to provide the Soviet side with all possible assistance to maintain the originally agreed-upon pace of repatriating 50,000 prisoners of war per month from the Soviet-controlled areas." When announcing the temporary suspension of prisoner of war repatriation, the Soviet authorities cited the terms of the original agreement of December 1946, which stated that if unforeseen circumstances occur, both parties reserve the right to suspend prisoner of war repatriation activities. Over the past six months, the prisoner of war repatriation issue has been a major difficulty for the Allied Control Council for Japan, and the Allied Headquarters has been protesting vigorously against the Soviet Union's delaying tactics, as the fact is that prisoners of war held by other Allied countries have long been repatriated to Japan. According to the latest report, the new prisoners of war and civilians held in Soviet-controlled areas still number over 700,000.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain Should Not Persist!</h3>
<p>At a time when the world is eagerly awaiting the early convening of the peace conference with Japan, the British government notified both China and the Soviet Union on the 13th, refusing the Soviet Union's proposal for a meeting of the foreign ministers of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to be held in China in January of next year to draft the peace treaty with Japan. It also firmly opposed the demand by China and the Soviet Union that the four powers retain veto power at the future peace conference with Japan, thus plunging the Far East into a stalemate again after China had mediated between the United States and the Soviet Union and brought about a turning point. All those who yearn for an early success in establishing peace in the Far East cannot but express disappointment and dismay at the British note to China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>More than two years and three months have passed since Japan's surrender; however, the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan has not yet begun. How can the countries concerned with the Far East not feel anxious and uneasy! Although defeated Japan is under the occupation and supervision of the Allied forces, its rapid recovery has made every country feel threatened by the resurgence of Japanese aggression. Even the American authorities, and even General MacArthur himself, are hoping for an early conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, in August of this year, the United States proposed convening a preliminary meeting for the peace treaty with Japan. Whether for its own interests or for the long-term peace of the Far East, our country has always hoped that the peace treaty with Japan can be discussed and concluded as soon as possible. Therefore, we welcome any proposal that can promote the peace treaty with Japan; we are even more willing to see the American proposal realized as soon as possible. However, the American proposal differs from the Soviet Union's opinion on both the procedures for convening the peace conference and the issue of the four powers' veto power. If the opinions of both sides cannot be reconciled and a compromise reached, the stalemate on the Japanese issue will ultimately be impossible to break. Therefore, on November 17, our government put forward a proposal to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, with two main points: ① The preliminary meeting of the peace treaty with Japan should be composed of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission, but the convening date should be agreed upon by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as soon as possible in order to draft the peace treaty with Japan and to decide on special items related to the convening of the peace conference with Japan. ② The voting at the preliminary meeting of the peace treaty with Japan should be by a majority of all member states (formerly proposed as a two-thirds majority, but now a simple majority), but this majority must include the concurring votes of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Our country's proposal not only reconciles the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, but also gives great respect to the status of the other eight countries. It is truly a reasonable and constructive proposal. If other countries can all act in a spirit of tolerance and use the Chinese proposal as the basis for negotiations, then the stalemate on the peace treaty with Japan will not be difficult to break, and a rapid turnaround will be achieved. Therefore, from that day on, we have been eagerly awaiting the practical replies from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet reply was the first to be delivered to our country on the 28th. Although its content is still quite different from the American opinion, it is closer to our country's proposal, which shows that the Soviet Union is by no means without room for compromise on the Japanese issue. In addition to suggesting that the foreign ministers of the four countries hold a meeting in China in January of next year to draft the peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet reply also firmly demanded that the four powers retain veto power. Whether based on reality or on legal considerations, the Soviet proposal has its full reasons, and it is not a far-fetched argument. Britain and the United States should give it careful consideration, and in particular, seek a compromise between the two sides' opinions under the principle of mutual tolerance and mutual concession.</p>
<p>However, after reading the British reply, we know that the British government not only opposes the four powers' veto power, but also continues to oppose the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan by a meeting of the four foreign ministers, and even expresses indifference to holding the meeting in China. Since Britain's attitude is such, the United States' attitude must also be the same, which goes without saying. It is also obvious that the stalemate on the Japanese issue cannot be broken.</p>
<p>In our opinion, British diplomacy follows the United States and looks to the United States for guidance. While this may be beneficial to Britain itself, if we broaden our horizons and look at the current precarious situation in the Far East, the great powers should no longer cling to their prejudices on the Japanese issue. We want to make it clear to the Foreign Secretary that the divergence of opinions among the four powers is preventing the breaking of the stalemate in the Far East and the convening of the peace conference with Japan. The result of this can only benefit the defeated Japan. A Times of London editorial on the 11th also warned of the hidden danger of Japan. What attitude should the British diplomatic authorities adopt toward the Japanese issue? There is a need for further consideration.</p>
<p>An Observation of Xinjiang from a Historical Perspective (Part Two)</p>
<p>Continued from yesterday's Sunday Forum</p>
<p>III. The Attitude Toward Studying Xinjiang History</p>
<p>Looking at Xinjiang civilization from the overall perspective of world civilization can inspire the profound feeling that human evolution is universally interconnected. It can also make the general public aware of the significance of evolutionary progress and know how to make choices. Today is the era of the atomic energy revolution. Standing at this watershed of evolution, looking around, one's heart is filled with excitement and self-confidence. Not only does the narrow and limited view of Xinjiang history appear outdated, but all so-called emerging civilizations also seem old-fashioned. As a matter of fact, all existing historical views still need to be carefully examined, humbly hoped for, and enthusiastically encouraged. I believe that compiling Xinjiang history must be done in this way, and compiling Chinese history or world history must also be done in this way. Only in this way can sound intellectual power possess a moral and spiritual force in the atomic energy era!</p>
<p>In terms of space, the expansion of world civilization roughly progresses from points to lines to planes to surfaces to spheres. The position of Xinjiang civilization is in this context. In terms of time, we suggest dividing the formation of Xinjiang historical materials into two stages for examination: classical historical materials and modern historical materials. In dealing with the classical historical stage, we should pay attention to the collation and analysis of various historical materials from China, Islamic countries, the West, and the Soviet Union, as well as the results of their mutual comparison. In dealing with the modern historical stage, we should pay attention to the synthesis and deduction of the above-mentioned historical materials, as well as their respective comprehensive outlets. Then, from these foundations, we can build a higher world spirit and give Xinjiang the world status it deserves.</p>
<p>IV. Looking at Xinjiang from Chinese History</p>
<p>Among classical historical materials, Chinese classical historical materials are the most classical. To study the classical history of Xinjiang without understanding Chinese classical historical materials is undoubtedly like a blind man talking in his sleep. This is an undeniable point. However, Chinese classical historical materials are not without their shortcomings. The biggest shortcoming is that the chronological order is often interrupted, with relatively substantial content only during prosperous times, while in times of decline, they become fragmented, intermittent, or even completely blank or disconnected. This is a phenomenon that must be specifically exposed.</p>
<p>Because the Chinese are the nation that attaches the greatest importance to historical records in the world, we can fortunately identify these chronological problems and alert those who pay attention to Chinese classical history in the future: the content of Chinese classical history is determined by the waxing and waning of Chinese dynasties' westward influence, thus clearly forming four centers: Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing. Between these centers, there are often neglected gaps, discontinuities, or only very subtle connections. Generally speaking, from 126 BC (the third year of Yuanshuo) to 790 AD (the sixth year of Zhenyuan), during the 916 years from Zhang Qian's return to the east to the Tang Dynasty's loss of the Western Regions, although there is a small portion of time when the situation is not very clear (a total of 42 years, namely from 176 AD—the fourth year of Xiping—when Yanqi rebelled and the Eastern Han Dynasty was strong, to 606 AD—the second year of Daye—the year before Pei Ju re-established control over the Western Regions, because at this time most historians had fled to the Yangtze River), various records are generally available, and clues can be found. This is the greatest contribution of Chinese classical history to Xinjiang. Secondly, from 791 AD (the seventh year of Zhenyuan) to 1208 AD (the first year of Jiading during the Song Ningzong reign, when Genghis Khan invaded Xinjiang in the following year and initiated Yuan history), there is a 407-year gap with particularly scarce materials, simply and vaguely. Again, from 1331 AD (when the Chagatai Khanate began internal turmoil and the situation was chaotic) to 1714 AD (one year before the Qing Kangxi army entered Tibet), there is another 383-year gap with not much material. Moreover, among the aforementioned two gaps (i.e., the 121 years from 1209 to 1330), the materials are focused on Yuan history and are not very clear and not regarded by general Chinese historians. Therefore, for the 1023 years from 791 AD to 1714 AD, roughly ten centuries, it can be said that they are all intermittent gaps. In summary, the time with relatively clear records accounts for half (1037 years), while the time that is unclear or completely disconnected also accounts for half. These contents are the main basis for Chinese historians to study the Western Regions.</p>
<p>Secondly, Chinese classical historians, influenced by Zhang Qian's exploration tradition, are almost all most interested in geography, such as the geographical treatises in successive official histories, travelogues of monks and envoys, and works such as "Records of the Western Regions," "Gazetteer of Xinjiang," and "Records of Waterways in the Western Regions." Their focus is on geographical research as the main task, and they describe history from a geographical perspective. Therefore, they lack connected insights and cannot break the isolation of the Xinjiang oases. They seem unable to break away from the traditional concept of the Thirty-Six Kingdoms and lack the ability to classify them culturally. This geographically centered view has led to one of the main reasons why modern Chinese historians cannot understand Xinjiang culture, and it is also one of the reasons why they only pay attention to land and not to people.</p>
<p>On the basis of this incomplete historical data and geographical view, modern Chinese historians attempted to synthesize a system. This academic movement began with the inspiration of Gu Yanwu, Huang Zongxi, and others, and developed into the frontier geography popular after the Daoguang period (such as Xu Song, Fang Qiu, Zhang Shizhou, He Qiutao, and Wei Yuan). Although their efforts have contributed to synthesizing past classical historical data, they cannot exceed their limitations, and errors that naturally occurred due to a lack of understanding of the world were inevitable. Unfortunately, these seemingly correct textual researches are still used today by many people as if they were indisputable truths, and the problems arise from here.</p>
<p>After Western scholars arrived, the work of synthesis was just beginning, and historians with scientific minds and objective attitudes appeared. They translated Western works, researched ethnicity, religion, and culture, and conducted archaeological excavations with Westerners in Gaochang, Loulan, and Beiting. However, their attention was also affected by the limitations of classical history. Most of them only did specialized work in the ancient parts of classical history that had rich content, and have not yet exerted their ability to do large-scale gap-filling work (a thousand years of gaps!). Therefore, the modern Chinese work of synthesis can be said to have not yet begun. The only relatively concrete example is Zeng Wenwu's "History of Chinese Management of the Western Regions."</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned situation in China, my conclusion is: If the compilation of a general history of Xinjiang in China is hastily based on the current foundation, it will be difficult to avoid being influenced by tradition. This influence is the traditional concept of geography, national defense, and blind self-confidence in the prosperous eras of the Han and Tang dynasties.</p>
<p>V. The Influence of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Also very important in this regard is the effort of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Although the tradition of Soviet civilization is only a little over a hundred years old, its influence is unprecedented, its scale is global, humanistic, social, and cultural. Therefore, the Soviet Union's historical work, its ambition, its concentration of power, and its close relationship with reality are also incomparable to historical work in other fields. For various reasons, although we cannot fully understand the Soviet Union's study of the history of Xinjiang, and study some of the current phenomena in the Soviet Union, we especially hope to cooperate with scholars from the Soviet Union to solve many historical problems that could not be solved under the early traditional efforts of China, Islamic countries, and the West.</p>
<p>First, we know that the Soviet Union's large-scale excavation work in Central Asia has exceeded the current total achievements in the world. Indirectly, the archaeological investigations in various parts of Xinjiang are not comparable to the sporadic efforts of Western scholars. We know that during the Sheng Shicai era, archaeological work in Central Asia penetrated into the Stone Age. The general investigation of Bronze Age civilization has made new contributions. Therefore, although the Soviet Union is a new country, and Soviet scholars belong to the newest school, the basic work they have built up is very solid. Therefore, if we want to study the history of Xinjiang in the Stone Age and all its ethnic social relations, the Soviet Union's data must be very helpful.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of textual historical materials, the Leningrad Academy of Sciences in the Soviet Union inherited the traditions of the efforts of the Tsarist Russian era, and with new perspectives and technologies, its comprehensive analysis and collation of Xinjiang historical materials must have achieved certain results, which we are pleased to hear. Moreover, the Soviet Union's academic point of view is comparatively biased towards sociology, economics, and politics, which is a good contrast to the West's emphasis on anthropology, ethnology, and linguistics.</p>
<p>Again, we have heard that many manuscript copies of original materials in Xinjiang are currently collected in the museum in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, for public exhibition. According to the magazine "Oriental Truth," published in that country, which specializes in the study of the history and culture of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang, there are as many as tens of thousands of these precious Central Asian manuscripts, among which there must be many achievements of anonymous historians in Xinjiang. Regarding this situation, we can only blame the stupidity, obstinacy, and ignorance of past Chinese officials, and cannot blame Soviet scholars for using them without authorization. Because from the perspective of Xinjiang civilization, which must be viewed from a global perspective, it does not matter who keeps them.</p>
<p>VI. Conclusion</p>
<p>Looking at the evolutionary processes of various historical views in China and the Soviet Union, we can draw a conclusion: The evolution of world civilization has promoted the evolution of various original isolated civilizations themselves. This evolution, in today's scientific era, has also promoted their historical views to embark on the road of modernization and globalization. However, the results are due to the different traditional environments, and the comprehensive achievements of China, Islamic countries, Western countries, and the Soviet Union, which produce different viewpoints and contents, still cannot be reconciled with each other today. Therefore, a general history of Xinjiang is also impossible to talk about, unless we maliciously want to rely only on some conclusions that are still subjective: such as the comprehensive forms of border geography in China, the comprehensive forms of Turkish national history in Islamic countries, the comprehensive forms of Western cultural history, and the comprehensive forms of Soviet social history, or a synthesis that focuses on one form while participating in one or two other forms of materials.</p>
<p>We propose that after the rolling campaigns of the frontier scholars of the Daoguang era in the past, the Turkish ethnological schools, the Western capitalist cultural schools, and the Soviet revolutionary sociological schools, we should launch a final comprehensive movement of Xinjiang history, and unify it with the great road of human civilization evolution. This is the advance of intellectual power singing and dancing. Invisibly, it can eliminate corruption, shift the atmosphere, and reverse the world! I sincerely wish that accomplished scholars at home and abroad can establish it in the spirit of science and democracy and in the mode of international cultural cooperation. I also earnestly ask all ambitious young people in the country to fight in the wind, sand, and scorching sun with the determination of pioneers.</p>
<p>In short, speaking from the current situation of Xinjiang, it is to study the history and culture of Xinjiang from the actual situation. Everyone is guided by the flow, but I trace back to the source. Then, when the source is in hand, the flow will be stronger, and it will eventually become a vast ocean, which can be inclusive and live as long as heaven and earth. According to my understanding, there are not a few people currently walking this path. For example, Li Fanqun spent a year cycling around the Taklamakan Desert, writing a monumental work of 500,000 words, but lacks the ability to publish it. For example, He Guisen, who is proficient in the Kazakh language, went from the Qilian Mountains to the Tianshan Mountains to interview nomadic peoples to collect data. For example, Li Beihai went deep into the pastures to discuss history with Kazakh scholars. For example, Mudiyi has devoted himself to Turkic languages for many years. For example, Haji Yahefu specializes in textual research. For example, Ni Yue holds a scientific attitude toward the history of his own nation (the Kazakh nation). For example, Muhammad, Alimuji, Paul, Liu Xiaoshan, and Di Yabin, etc., are tireless in studying history. The advancements, and then, like the youth historian Liu Kegu, who died in the desert, the scholar Wang Lairan, and the enthusiasm of the scholar Qi Guang, bring a bit of sadness to the lively atmosphere. This bit of sadness, the magnificent scenery, are enough to arouse the spirit of pioneering. (The End)</p>

Only more than 600 people are currently being accommodated and managed, and they are unable to receive treatment due to a lack of funds.</p>
<h3>Disturbance at the Wuhu Zhongshan Memorial Hall Cinema</h3>
<p>Conflict Between Students and Employees, Military Police</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Wuhu, 14th dispatch] During the 6:00 PM screening at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall Cinema in Wuhu on the 13th, a student from Anhui College was pushed out of the gate by a ticket inspector. After being humiliated, dozens of classmates from Anhui College came to question the staff, resulting in a conflict. A staff member was hit on the head, and one student was detained by the military police. Another student went on stage and ordered the students from Anhui College watching the movie to gather. That student was also arrested. Upon hearing the news, the students from Anhui College on Zheshan Mountain gathered at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall. Seeing that four students had been taken away, they shouted that four more had been arrested, believing that three had been arrested first and then four more, totaling seven. The situation became increasingly agitated. They questioned the military police as to why they were only arresting students. Fortunately, Division Commander Lin Zhan heard the news and immediately ordered the release of the four students and instructed the military police present not to use force. Although the students knew that those arrested had been released, they thought that three were still being detained, so they mistakenly destroyed films and other items in the cinema. The military police, having received orders in advance, allowed them to do as they pleased, so there was no bloodshed. Today, Division Commander Lin Zhan and Commissioner Yang Jixun received reporters and stated that although they cherish the students in this chaotic situation, they also hope that university students will set an example for the people, abide by the law, and not resort to violence. The case is currently being handled carefully by Division Commander Lin.</p>

<h3>Stalemate on German Reparations: Fate of Foreign Ministers' Conference Hinges on Soviet Attitude; Molotov Consults Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 14th] After the Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded its Friday session amidst turbulent storms, the fate of this session appears to hang in the balance. Molotov has urgently consulted with Moscow during the extended recess, a crucial preliminary move. Based on developments in recent days, the Kremlin's instructions to Molotov have been distinctly negative. Molotov's demeanor during Friday's meeting forced the conference to seriously consider a brief recess, as proceeding to discuss other items on the agenda would be futile unless Marshall intended to allow Molotov to evade the issue of reparations. However, all indications suggest that Marshall is unwilling to permit Molotov to avoid this significant matter. At Friday's meeting, Marshall reiterated the U.S. position, stating that an agreement on economic unity, including full resolution of reparations and the transfer of German resources from various zones, is a condition for any political settlement. Therefore, unless Molotov can propose a method for handling reparations at Monday's meeting, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will, at least for the present, enter a state of impasse. It is anticipated that after the Foreign Ministers' Conference reaches an impasse, the next step in Germany will be to consolidate the existing economic structures in each zone. Marshall and Bevin indicated at Friday's meeting that under such circumstances, the Anglo-American zone merger agreement will continue to be implemented, but will remain open for other powers to join, with the ultimate goal of establishing German economic unity. Although Molotov's speech on Friday was highly critical, he did not express a willingness to terminate the meeting even before completing discussion of other items on the agenda. If, on Monday, he refuses to move the reparations issue to a more concrete stage or accept the Anglo-American view that continued discussion is futile without resolving the reparations issue, the Foreign Ministers' Conference may inevitably enter a state similar to the final week of the first Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1945. At that time, China and the Western powers firmly rejected the Soviet Union's procedural objections, and Molotov presented new suggestions daily during the final week to show the world that the failure of the conference could not be attributed to the Soviet Union. Recent Soviet propaganda has begun to foreshadow the exoneration of Molotov and his delegation from responsibility for the failure of this session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is noteworthy that the Soviet "Izvestia" newspaper hinted that the outcome of this session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference depends on the policies adopted by the four foreign ministers outside the conference.</p>
<h3>Shadow Deepens on U.S.-Soviet Relations; Difficult to Coordinate on Far East Issues</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th, United Press] If U.S.-Soviet relations continue on their current trend and undergo a sudden, sharp shift, the "cold war" between the Soviet Union and the United States may intensify further in the coming months. People generally refer to the political, economic, and ideological rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States worldwide as a "cold war," but this term may not fully describe the actual situation. Recent developments have led responsible officials here to fear that U.S.-Soviet relations may soon become increasingly strained in the three areas of Korea, China, and Japan in the East.</p>
<p>The Soviet side has sharply criticized the United Nations Commission on Korea as a tool of the United States. The Commission is scheduled to fly to Seoul in early January next year. It is rumored that if the Soviet Union refuses it entry into North Korea, the Commission will carry out its mission in South Korea. U.S. officials apparently believe that the government established in South Korea will have the strength to withstand the unification struggle with North Korea in the future. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also apparently believes that the communist forces it has cultivated can govern all of Korea after all U.S. and Soviet troops withdraw, regardless of who is right, who wins, or what the outcome is. Many responsible figures here ultimately fear that U.S.-Soviet relations will worsen. The U.S. Congress, controlled by the Republican Party, intends to ensure that China receives substantial economic aid to help the National Government resist communism. This sentiment can also be expected to be another factor contributing to further strain in U.S.-Soviet relations. As for Japan, the points of contention between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are how to sign a peace treaty with Japan and how to control Japan. In short, as the shadow of the conflict between the two countries on general world issues deepens, the tension in their relations in the Far East will also intensify.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Agreement on German Territory to Be Announced This Week</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 14th] It is reported that the Anglo-American agreement on financial and economic policies for the Anglo-American merged zone in Germany, which was recently concluded in Washington, may be announced simultaneously in Washington and London on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Greece Achieves Results</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 13th] The U.S. Aid to Greece mission released its five-month progress report today, stating that the aid plan has saved Greece from disaster, but time is still needed to improve the precarious situation and economic situation.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Considers Appropriate Measures to Safeguard Italy's Independence and Freedom; Last Batch of U.S. Troops Withdraw from Italy Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London, 14th Broadcast: Rome Report, the last batch of U.S. troops stationed in Italy returned home today aboard the transport ship "Admiral Sims", nine hours earlier than the withdrawal deadline stipulated in the peace treaty. At present, according to the treaty, only a small number of British and American registration personnel and winding-up personnel remain in Rome, but they are not performing occupation tasks.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman issued a statement today regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Italy, stating that although U.S. troops will soon be completely withdrawn from Italy, the United States will still consider appropriate measures to prevent Italy's independence from being threatened in the future and to maintain the country's peace, freedom, and independence.</p>
<p>Truman's statement said, "The United States, in fulfilling its obligations under the Italian peace treaty, has withdrawn its troops stationed in Italy. However, the United States continues to maintain an interest in safeguarding Italy's freedom and independence. If developments indicate that Italy's freedom and independence, as stipulated in the Italian peace treaty, are under direct or indirect threat, the United States, as a signatory to the treaty and a member of the United Nations, will have to consider appropriate steps necessary to maintain peace and security."</p>
<h3>Rumors of Intercepted Secret Moscow Order; Anti-Communist Movement Sweeps Through Turkey</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ankara, 13th] As the martial law in the northwestern province of Turkey is about to be lifted and U.S. military assistance is continuously flowing in, the Turkish anti-communist movement has suddenly erupted. This new movement is led by students, intellectuals, and the opposition Democratic Party, but the Turkish government remains silent. The influential non-partisan Turkish newspaper "Fatherland" recently published a report stating that the Turkish government has obtained special instructions from Moscow for its agents in Turkey. It is claimed that the main points are to use money to buy off agitators, hoping to stimulate public sentiment throughout Turkey so that people cannot clearly distinguish right from wrong," and then foment civil war. The newspaper also urged the Turkish government to publish this secret order.</p>
<h3>French Government Takes a Hard Line; Resolutely Rejects Soviet Union's Repeated Protests; Head of Soviet Diaspora Group Also Detained</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Franco-Soviet relations deteriorated further today. The Soviet Embassy in Paris sent two strong protests to the French government yesterday and today, demanding the immediate release of Soviet citizens arrested in France, but the French Foreign Ministry resolutely rejected them. Since the French authorities took over the Soviet diaspora group near Paris last month, the French authorities have arrested 32 Soviet citizens, who have been or will be deported. Twelve of them are members of the Soviet diaspora group.

<h3>Construction of Oil Pool in Donggou Town; Zhong Yuliang Asks for Speedy Demolition and Relocation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] During Zhang Qun's tenure as mayor, the area of the oil pool in the city was determined to be Jiangkou Laoshusha after long-term discussions with local gentry. No other areas may build oil pools, and those that have already been built must be ordered to relocate. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, Donggou Town in Pudong had a small-scale oil depot, which was a temporary storage place.

Therefore, please demolish and relocate as soon as possible to maintain political order and ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Garbage Contractors Seeking Advantage, Illegally Dumping at Wangjiadu; Shanghai Dredging Bureau Requests Crackdown</h3>
<p>The city has a dense population, and daily garbage production is no less than several thousand tons. If not properly disposed of, it will not only affect public health, but also affect the navigation of the Huangpu River. In order to prevent garbage contractors from arbitrarily dumping garbage into the Huangpu River and hindering the current, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau previously obtained the consent of the Health Bureau to set up a garbage dump at Longhua Mouth, Yangsi Port, and erected signs along the dredging line for identification. Since its implementation, it has achieved temporary results. Recently, the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department discovered that all garbage boats did not sail to the above-mentioned designated locations, but gathered near Wangjiadu River Dun Port and Xinjing Port in Shanghai to dump garbage, which has been confirmed by the Dredging Bureau's dispatched personnel. The Bureau believes that garbage contractors are not only failing to move garbage from outside the boundary to inside the boundary, but are deliberately seeking advantage by dumping at Wangjiadu in order to avoid scrutiny. If no action is taken, the garbage will be washed into the center of the river along the coast with the tide, blocking the waterway, affecting water quality and cleanliness, and seriously affecting public health. The Bureau further believes that dredging the Huangpu River is to maintain the waterway, and to achieve this task, it relies on the cooperation of all parties. The Bureau has sent a letter to the Health Bureau at the end of last week regarding the above-mentioned facts.</p>

<h3>Seven Measures for Year-End Bonuses; General Labor Union Requests Maintenance of Original Proposal; Petition to the Municipal Government and Social Bureau Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses for workers this year, seven measures were passed by the Municipal Government meeting last week, generally stipulating that the bonus amount should be one month's salary, and if the employer cannot afford it, it may be shortened. The labor side agrees with some parts of these measures, but expresses disagreement with the stipulated staggered payment and the measure of being able to reduce it appropriately in January. The General Labor Union is currently holding a meeting to discuss practical measures. However, the Industrial Association also opposes the Municipal Government's resolution, expressing disagreement with the issuance of year-end bonuses, which has caused great indignation among colleagues in the labor community. At the temporary meeting convened by the General Labor Union yesterday morning, it was resolved that the reasons are insufficient, and that at this time of national mobilization to suppress the rebellion, social needs must be stable. Now that a precedent has been set, it cannot be overturned by the opinions of a few people. The following three measures were unanimously adopted: The entire Standing Council will be delegated to go to the Municipal Government and Social Bureau at 10 am on the 16th to request the maintenance and earnest implementation of the original proposal, and the consent of the labor side must be obtained for the staggered payment and reduction measures. Regularly invite reporters. The points made by the Industrial Association are inconsistent with the facts and will be publicly stated on a regular basis. After the case was discussed, and regarding the case of Yang Zhao, Chairman of the Rubber Industry Union in the Fourth District, who was inexplicably threatened by hooligans, it was decided to delegate Standing Council members Gui Fusheng, Qiu Changjiang, and Council member Zhou Yunjiang to investigate the truth and report it to the competent authorities for severe punishment.</p>

Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jishun, Xu Xueyu, and others accompanied the ship and warmly received these distant guests from the high mountains and deserts of the Northwest. All the men and women of the song and dance troupe were extremely excited. Most of them had never boarded a steamship before and had no sailing experience, so they expressed great interest in this water trip. The Jiangya steamship is a new and excellent commercial steamship in our country. Yesterday, Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, personally led the troupe to visit various facilities on the ship and explained them in detail. At around 12 noon, they had lunch on the ship. Senator Zhang Yiqu composed a poem on the spot, with the lines "Meeting by chance like old friends, Wishing Xinjiang well," to express his welcome. After the meal, a song and dance performance was held, with performances by the troupe and the coming reality. At 1 pm, after arriving at the river near Chongming, they stopped briefly. The wind was calm, the sea and sky were the same color. The members of the troupe scrambled to board the deck to look into the distance, and occasionally played musical instruments in the breeze. The Jiangya steamship returned to Shanghai at 1:10 pm and returned to Shanghai at 4 pm. They went with excitement and returned with joy. Kangbarhan, the flower of the Uyghur people, expressed special satisfaction, believing that in terms of personal experience, she gained a new understanding of "riding the wind and waves."</p>
<p>Kangbarhan Talks About Her Impressions of This Trip</p>
<p>[Also reported] Miss Kangbarhan, the "Flower of the Uyghur People," at the request of reporters on the Jiangya steamship, expressed her impressions of this trip, saying that in the past, ethnic minority compatriots in the border areas had little contact with inland culture, and the people in the border areas had mixed good and bad imaginations of the inland. Since the central government cared about Xinjiang and specially sent General Zhang Zhizhong to govern Xinjiang, the relationship between the border province and the central government has been strengthened. General Zhang's wise and resolute governance has further increased the faith of the people in the border areas in the central government. Therefore, we often hope to visit the inland. I am deeply gratified to be able to visit the mainland this time under the leadership of General Zhang Zhizhong. She continued that the troupe has been warmly welcomed by inland compatriots in Beijing and Shanghai, which fully reveals the feelings of inland compatriots, and they feel very happy. As for what she is most interested in in Shanghai, it is movies, singing, and dramas. Finally, she said that the troupe's dance can only represent the life and customs of the ethnic minorities in the border areas. She hopes to have the opportunity to learn more in Shanghai and to reduce the impact.</p>

<h3>Inheritance Tax Dispute After the Death of Xiao Dangui</h3>
<p>Shaoxing Direct Tax Branch Sends Letter to Local Court to Investigate Information</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] After Xiao Dangui's suicide, her inheritance will be subject to inheritance tax by the Direct Tax Bureau. However, both the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau and the Shaoxing Branch of the Direct Tax Bureau intend to carry out the collection procedures. The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has sent personnel to investigate the exact amount of Xiao's inheritance. At the same time, the Shaoxing Branch of the Direct Tax Bureau also sent a letter to the local court of this city, entrusting it to check and reply on relevant information. The official letter from the Shaoxing Branch of the Direct Tax Bureau is recorded as follows: In order to inquire about the quantity of Qian Chunfeng's inheritance in Shanghai and related information, and to determine who is the designated legal administrator, the Jingxian Tax Collection Office reported: "It has been found that Qian Chunfeng (Yueling Xiao Dangui) committed suicide by taking poison in Shanghai on October 23 this year. Qian Chunfeng is a native of Changle Town in the jurisdiction of this office. After her suicide, she left a huge amount of property, which should be declared by the legal heir Qian Boquan in accordance with the law regarding the fact of death and the status of property in order to levy inheritance tax. In addition to the part of the real estate in Changle, he has been ordered to fill out the report. There are many houses, real estate, and movable properties in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Please check with the relevant agencies in the above-mentioned two places for verification and inform them to facilitate simultaneous taxation." According to this, Article 16 of the Inheritance Tax Law stipulates: "If the deceased has property that should be taxed in accordance with this law, the taxpayer, inheritance administrator, or will executor shall report the fact of death and the list of inheritance to the local inheritance tax collection agency within two months from the date of the commencement of the inheritance." Now it has been found that one and a half months have passed since Qian Baifeng's death, and the person receiving the inheritance should be notified to declare in accordance with the law for verification and taxation. However, the case of Zhang Chunfan, a person involved in the case, has been investigated and sued by the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, and he obviously has no right to inherit the inheritance. Also, the Shanghai newspaper on November 14 carried a piece of news that a part of Qian Chunfeng's inheritance in Shanghai had been taken back to Changle Town, Sheng County, by her brother Qian Boquan, and it was stated that the lawyer Mao Xianren proved it and a contract was signed at that time. As for the actual situation, the Benyi Sheng County Tax Collection Office has been ordered to investigate it. In addition to the part of the inheritance in Hangzhou, which has been sent to the Hangzhou Direct Tax Bureau for verification, the amount of inheritance in Shanghai and related information are available for inspection in your court. Please grant an inquiry and reply.</p>

<h3>Important Institution for Directing Flight - Air Traffic Control Station - Movements of Any Aircraft Completely Clear - Any Kind of Aerial Incident Immediately Detected</h3>
<p>[Special Report from this Newspaper] In Nanhua Airport, there is a small bungalow. Inside, there are machines and radio communication tools. The walls are covered with maps and record boards. Ten young men in Air Force uniforms are busy working. This small room, these few dozen workers, control the entire flight traffic in Chinese airspace. They are completely aware of the movement and location of any aircraft. They can immediately detect any possible aerial incident. This small but important institution is the Air Traffic Control Station of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>Air traffic control is still a nascent field in China, a term unfamiliar to most. However, with the increasing development of the aviation industry, the arrival of the aviation age is rapid and inevitable. Therefore, the importance of air traffic control is as indispensable as traffic lights controlling traffic on Nanjing Road today.</p>
<p>What exactly is air traffic control? Taking Nanhua Airport as an example, any aircraft flying out must first fill out a flight plan form and submit it to the control station for review. The plan should include details such as aircraft type, aircraft number, pilot and radio operator names, radio equipment type, flight route, estimated departure time, estimated flight time, fuel load, alternate airport, and other information.</p>
<p>Observing Weather Conditions in Various Locations - Deciding Whether to Take Off</p>
<p>The control station reviews the plan in detail, paying particular attention to the fuel load and alternate airport. Generally, an aircraft's fuel load must be sufficient to fly to its destination and, in case it cannot land there, to fly to the alternate airport, with an additional hour's worth of fuel as a reserve for unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>After all items on the plan have passed inspection, the weather conditions for flying are considered. The control station obtains weather information from two sources: weather reports provided every half hour by central meteorological stations across the country and local meteorological stations of the China National Aviation Corporation; and weather forecasts provided four times a day by the US Naval Meteorological Station (part of which was the former Sino-American Cooperative Organization meteorological station), including wind direction, cloud height, visibility, and other data. The control station conducts a comprehensive observation of the weather conditions along the aircraft's flight route, and decides whether the aircraft can fly according to established standards.</p>
<p>Flight Permit Contains Various Instructions</p>
<p>When everything is "OK", the control station issues a flight permit, and the aircraft can take off. The flight permit also specifies necessary instructions, such as the altitude to fly at or where to pass a certain aircraft. The permit is not given directly to the pilot, but to the control tower at the airport for radio transmission.</p>
<p>The control tower is responsible for flights within a three-mile radius, using radio to instruct aircraft on how to take off, how to avoid danger, and transmit the instructions from the permit to the pilot via radio. The pilot must repeat the instructions to avoid errors.</p>
<p>Once the aircraft has taken off and left the control tower's area of control, it must contact the "Approach Control", located in Jiangwan. Currently, due to temporary measures, it is operated by the US military, and its control area extends to fifty miles. Within this area, all aircraft must be under its direction.</p>
<p>Position Clearly Displayed on Maps and Record Boards</p>
<p>Beyond the fifty-mile radius is the Shanghai Area. The pilot proceeds toward the destination according to the instructions of the control station, sending telegrams to radio stations to report the flight position and weather conditions en route. After passing each station, a telegram must be sent to report the departure time and estimated time of arrival at the next station. Upon receiving this report, the Civil Aviation Bureau's radio station immediately notifies the control station by telegraph or other rapid means. The duty personnel at the control station note this on the record board. If an aircraft exceeds a reasonable amount of time without sending a telegram, it may have encountered an incident. Based on the last reported position, the control station can estimate the approximate location of the accident and take necessary measures.</p>
<p>The above description is based on aircraft flying out of Shanghai. Conversely, the situation is entirely similar for aircraft flying in from various locations. Therefore, the records and maps at the control station can indicate the airspace in which a particular aircraft is flying at any time, and the number of aircraft flying in the airspace over China at any given moment.</p>
<p>Most Staff Members Have Interned in the United States for an Extended Period</p>
<p>Currently, the only established air traffic control station is in Shanghai. The Civil Aviation Administration originally planned to establish eight stations in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Beiping, Xi'an, Kunming, Chongqing, and Guiyang, but due to a lack of equipment, the latter four stations had to be temporarily suspended. The control stations in Hankou, Guangzhou, and Beiping are expected to be established within the near future.</p>
<p>The Shanghai station currently has twenty-eight air traffic control personnel, most of whom are Air Force personnel who have interned at the US Civil Aeronautics Administration for an extended period. The rest are engineering graduates from Jiaotong University, Tsinghua University, and other institutions. They are currently establishing an air traffic control training class at Hongqiao Airport to train more specialized personnel to undertake this important task. It is hoped that with their efforts, we will never again hear or see the tragedy of an aerial accident!</p>

<h3>Bandit Leader Sun Jiugui from Lincheng Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi Office, 13th] Sun Jiugui, from Zhangjiazhuang Village, Bazhuang Township, 13th District, Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu, currently serves as the Foreign Affairs Director of the bandit army's cooperative. He occasionally sneaks into Wuxi, disguising himself as a merchant, to purchase supplies and gather military intelligence. In the spring of last year, Sun Jiugui and his brother Jiugen murdered Zhao Guoxing, a fellow villager, and strangled Zhao's second son, Xiujian. Zhao's eldest son, Xiuming, seized the opportunity to escape to Wuxi and makes a living by selling groceries. In addition, two brothers, Sun Mingzheng and Sun Mingzhi, also from Yancheng and residing near Wuqiao in this city, recently returned to their hometown with the returning home corps. However, they were discovered by the treacherous bandit Sun Jiugui and others, who led their troops to attempt to kill them. Fortunately, the Suns were alert and fled in the night, returning to Wuxi. Their mother (who is seventy years old) was unfortunately subjected to brutal torture by the bandit army, leaving her with numerous scars. At the same time, the bandit criminal Sun Jiugui and his brother led their henchmen Zhu Baoyu, Zhu Baocai, Zhu Baoxiang, Ling Fengqi, Zhu Songhua, and others to murder villager Zhu Yindong and extorted 30 dan of rice from Zhu's wife, Sun. On the 12th of this month, the treacherous bandit Sun Jiugui, due to a shortage of military supplies for the bandit army, chartered a boat from Jiangbei, which sailed from Yancheng to Wuxi and docked at the Wuqiao River. This was discovered by the victims Sun Mingzheng and others, who reported it to the criminal police team. They went to arrest him, and on the 13th, he was escorted to the police headquarters. After questioning by Section Chief Zhang of the Judicial Section, Sun confessed to the above atrocities without denial. He was ordered to be detained for strict investigation.</p>
<h3>Bandits Demand 30 Million - Kidnapped Victim Escapes and Returns to Cheng</h3>
<p>[Report from our Jiangyin Office, 13th] The Beiwai Land and Water Transportation Cooperative used a special vehicle to transport mandarin oranges and other fruits from Shanghai to Cheng the other day. At around 9 PM on the 8th, while traveling through the Hujia Ferry area on the Xicheng Road, the vehicle broke down and stopped for repairs. Suddenly, seven or eight bandits appeared, kidnapped the escort, Zhu Mingxun, and immediately forced him to write a note, which was handed to the driver to take back, demanding 30 million in ransom to be paid at a designated location near Tangtou Bridge on the 7th in order to redeem him. Zhu Mingxun escaped danger and returned to Cheng on the 11th. The police station had already received a report, but fearing for the hostage's life, they did not make it public. They are now devising ways to hunt down the criminals. It is also rumored that the Xicheng Company was extorted for 50 million by bandits. The victim, fearing retaliation, has not made a public statement.</p>

Gu presented the "Renaissance" topic that he had previously spoken about at the Chinese Education Society in Nanjing, stating that he believes that "political revolution," "social transformation," and "cultural renaissance" are extremely important when studying the issue of national revival movement in recent years. We must have three critical standards when discussing the Renaissance today: 1. National culture must be full of creative vitality and seek its cultural roots; 2. National culture must have the spirit of the times and pay attention to cultural exchange; 3. Select excellent culture as its core value and spread it abroad, as part of the legacy of world culture. Subsequently, Li Ximou, the acting director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Chief Wu, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered speeches.</p>

<h3>Ordnance Automobile Fought Vigorously but Lost to Dagon: 67 to 57, a Difference of Ten Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After arriving in Shanghai, the basketball team of the 16th Ordnance Automobile Regiment won three games, defeating Ren Ji Xu Shan Qingbai. Last night, they encountered their first strong opponent and were defeated by the new army Dagon team by 67 to 57, losing by ten points. In the first half, Dagon led with 29 to 17. Dagon assembled the elite of the crowd and Zheng Han, and its appeal was very strong. The competition between the two sides was extremely fierce, with non-stop fierce battles from beginning to end, but in terms of excitement, it was still difficult to satisfy.</p>
<p>The visiting army was inevitably flustered in the face of a strong enemy. At the beginning of the game, Ti Hang, Cao Zhiji, and Zheng Dagang missed four consecutive free throws, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, Wen Huazhongqiang and Huang Boling scored one after another, taking a 6-2 and 8-3 lead. The visiting army chased to 7-8 and 10-3. Dagon's performance was awkward and lacked tacit understanding. Cai Wenzhang replaced Cai Zhongqiang, and Dagon sent a smooth journey, scoring 16 consecutive points, making it 29-12, which laid the foundation for victory. The first half ended 29-17.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Ordnance Automobile Regiment switched to man-to-man defense, and the defense improved greatly. The strength was still abundant, and they were unyielding. Dagon's vigor was frustrated, and the situation became more balanced, with both sides scoring points. In the last four minutes, Kui Wenhua was fouled out, and the score was 61-50. The Ordnance Automobile Regiment continued its efforts and chased to 63-57, only six points behind. Unfortunately, they fell short of success because time had run out. Zhongqiang and Wenlong scored another four points, resulting in a final score of 67-57. Although the Ordnance Automobile Regiment lost, it was indeed not easy.</p>

In the end, Xinhua won the first victory of the finals by one valuable point, 25 to 24, over Industrial and Mining.</p>
<h3>Basketball Committee Donates 25 Million Yuan to the Sports Reporters Association</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Although the ticket prices for last night's basketball game between the 16th Ordnance Automobile Regiment and Dagon were raised to 50,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, the Municipal Gymnasium was still packed.

<h3>Official Exchange Rate Far from Black Market Rate; Overseas Remittance Income Still Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Currently, overseas remittance income still shows no improvement due to the large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate. According to estimates by relevant sources, before the war, China's annual overseas remittance income could be converted to US$300 million. However, at that time, there were no restrictions on international remittances. The situation has changed dramatically after the war, and many countries have foreign exchange controls. For example, Singapore stipulates that each person's monthly overseas remittance shall not exceed 45 Singapore dollars. Other parts of Southeast Asia also have similar restrictions. According to official estimates, it can still reach approximately US$100 million per year, but due to losses from smuggling, the actual income of the country is far less than this amount.</p>
<p>Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association Hosts Banquet for Director of Textile Adjustment Committee</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] On the evening of the 13th, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association hosted a banquet for Yuan Liang, Director of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the directors and deputy directors of the committee. All members of the Sixth District Association attended. It is reported that Director Tang Shangyuan briefly reported on the outline of the draft of the flower yarn and cloth management implementation plan that had been completed. The general principle is still to purchase national cotton in a unified manner and distribute it to various factories for processing and weaving, and then sell it in a unified manner. After Director Yuan finished his report, the members of the Sixth District Association expressed their opinions on the main points that had been reported, and Director Yuan expressed his willingness to accept them for consideration. It is said that the draft of the implementation plan will be personally presented to Beijing for review by Yuan himself in the coming days.</p>
<p>Hangzhou's Monetary Market Is Extremely Tight; Commodity Prices Are Expected to Return to Normal</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th Dispatch] Since the issuance of the Gold Yuan, commodity prices in Hangzhou have also fluctuated. The list price of No. 1 rice is 780,000 yuan, and 1.36 million yuan for twelve pounds of Longtou fine cloth. However, the monetary market has been extremely tight recently. On the 13th, the China Trust Bureau threw out 14 billion yuan of rayon, totaling about 20 billion yuan including the amount due, and could not balance it out until 9:00 p.m. According to people familiar with the financial community, the monetary market is still extremely tight, so commodity prices in Hangzhou are expected to be slightly lower.</p>
<p>Stopping Remittances to Other Ports Affects the Business of Cigarette Factories</p>
<p>After the government recently issued a new order to stop remittances to other ports, the cigarette factories have suffered a lot of losses as a result. This is because most of the cigarette factories in this city focus on business in other ports, and raw materials must also be transported from other ports. The receipt and payment of goods must rely on remittances. Now that the government wants to stop remittances to other ports, it will inevitably put the factories in a state of contraction or stagnation. The Cigarette Factory Association, keenly aware of the real situation of its members, decided to submit a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce through the board of directors to appeal to the Ministry of Finance to improve this measure.</p>
<h3>The Cigarette Market Is Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened in the morning because the colleagues' monetary market was still tight, and it was rumored that the authorities would inspect the warehouse, and people's minds were weak. There were still many resales in the market, and the market was low. By the time of the midday closing, someone was searching for low prices, and as a result, ten large British and Lao Dao cigarettes were reduced by a small amount of 500,000 yuan each. The remaining Beautiful Golden Mouse Brandy and 20 Big Three Cannon Qianmen, etc., were each reduced by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, after the closing, scattered households outside the market absorbed ten large British cigarettes, and the transaction was completed at a price of 200,000 yuan above the list price. Lao Dao was also 100,000 yuan more expensive, and the owner was willing to sell.</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods in Hong Kong Are Gradually Becoming Active; Woolen Cloth Is the Most Popular; The Price of Glass Is Also Low</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong News] Since the United Kingdom and Japan officially resumed trade in November, Hong Kong's trade with Japan, although still controlled by the governments of both places, has recently shown significant development compared to before. Private trade has been widely launched, and some commercial firms have begun to accept contracts for ordering Japanese goods. After the procedures are completed by both parties and approved by the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan through the Industrial and Commercial Supply Office, Japanese goods can be transported from Japan to Hong Kong. Under this situation, imported Japanese goods can also obtain foreign exchange supply from the government.</p>
<p>Currently, the goods that can be publicly accepted for orders include cotton textiles, woolen fabrics, various woven materials, silk fabrics, Fuji silk, printed silk, paper, various miscellaneous goods and toys, chemical dyes, chemical products, glass, porcelain, stationery, fountain pens, pencils, slide rules, seafood, etc. The types are extremely complex. The samples of the above-mentioned commodities are complete and have fixed prices. Among them, the best-selling goods in Hong Kong recently are various woolen fabrics. There are as many as eighty styles, and the quality is acceptable. The better ones are sold as British goods. The price is only 13 Hong Kong dollars per yard, which is double width, so it is very popular. Those who arrive in time have a profit of three or four cents. The next lowest price and cost-effective is glass. Because the current price of Japanese goods is still stipulated by the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan in US dollars, and is determined based on market prices around the world, and the Japanese goods that can be ordered for export cannot be suitable for export, and the surge in arrivals has caused the previous orders to be discounted immediately. For example, not long ago, a batch of pencils arrived in Hong Kong. When the order was placed, the price of pencils in Hong Kong was 20 yuan per box. After the batch of Japanese goods arrived in Hong Kong, the price plummeted. Now it has fallen to 5 yuan per box, and it is still difficult to sell. The losses suffered by merchants can be seen from this. Therefore, although various Japanese goods can be ordered at will in Hong Kong, general merchants are unwilling to order in large quantities. Among them, many buy spot goods rather than order futures, because they are afraid that a large number of spot goods may arrive at any time after ordering futures, and there are many doubts about Japanese goods. In order to avoid unexpected losses, they have to adopt this policy.</p>
<p>Recently, Sir Sassoon, who arrived in Hong Kong, expressed his opinions on the future of Hong Kong's foreign trade as a whole: "Hong Kong has taken the place of Shanghai after the war, and China's chaos has also promoted Hong Kong's prosperity. Chinese are constantly coming to Hong Kong from the north, and their attention and investment in Hong Kong are now in full swing. Hong Kong has become the main entrepot port in the Far East, and all opportunities are very unique. In the two years after the war, the progress of Hong Kong's trade with the Far East and the West Pacific has been quite amazing. Just look at the numbers of import and export ships and air traffic to see the proof. Not only that, under the current situation in China, British, American, and overseas Chinese capital will gradually move south, and Guangdong and neighboring provinces will inevitably prosper, and Hong Kong will also benefit a lot."</p>
<h3>70 Million US Dollar Loan for American Cotton Is Still Under Negotiation; National Bank Advisor Yang Ge Has Flown to the US from Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is rumored that the US$70 million US cotton loan is nearing completion. The reporter inquired from relevant parties. It is learned that the cotton loan is still under negotiation and is being handled by the US Export-Import Bank. However, the case still needs to be finally approved by the US State Department before it can be approved. The general perception is that the hope is strong. The term of the loan is not long, and it is stipulated that China will import loaned American cotton. After producing and exporting textiles, the resulting US foreign exchange will be used to repay in installments. It is reported that Dr. Yang Ge, Advisor to the Central Bank, flew to the US from Shanghai on the 12th, which is not unrelated to the negotiation of the US cotton loan.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Ease Outside the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soap market for daily necessities opened. Sales on this street were still active, and retailers were still interested, so prices were still good. Later, because of the high prices, people took the opportunity to sell, and the market softened. Finally, the listed price of Gu Ben soap was 990,000 yuan, while the market price was 30,000 to 40,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Arrow Knife soap was sold for 1,070,000 yuan, Huang Xiangmao for 750,000 yuan, and Bull Brand Henry for 880,000 yuan. Someone bought it. Guanghua soap traded for 780,000-90,000 yuan. Matches were firm, and foreign candles fell slightly by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tax on Xuzhou Cured Tobacco Leaves Adjusted Again</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance received a telegram from the Goods Tax Department that the amount of tobacco leaf tax in the fourth phase of the Henan region has been adjusted for the second time to 1,145,000 yuan for Grade A, 873,000 yuan for Grade B, and 545,000 yuan for Grade C. Subsequently, the Shanghai District Tax Bureau will levy a supplementary tax on Xuzhou tobacco leaves based on the Grade A tax amount of 1,145,000 yuan in the region. It is hereby announced that the second Xuzhou tobacco leaf tax for the fourth phase of this year will be re-levied from December 11. The tax amount for Grade A Xuzhou tobacco leaves will be adjusted from 793,000 yuan to 1,145,000 yuan per 100 market catties. It is noted that the first adjustment of the tax amount for the fourth phase of this year was implemented on November 25. The tax amount for Xuzhou was adjusted from 640,000 yuan to 793,000 yuan per 100 market catties, Xiangyang leaves were adjusted from 315,000 yuan to 429,000 yuan, and Qingzhou was adjusted from 500,000 yuan to 722,000 yuan. Within 15 days, the tax amount for Grade A Xuzhou leaves was adjusted from 640,000 yuan to 1,145,000 yuan, a difference of 500,000 yuan per 100 market catties.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Wool Quota; Notice Has Not Been Issued Yet</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It is reported that relevant agencies believe that the current import quota for wool is too small, only accounting for 15% of the actual needs. Therefore, they have decided to take 1.5 million US dollars of wool from the goods arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange to add to the original import quota of 2 million US dollars per quarter. However, although this matter has been decided, the official notice has not yet been issued. People in the industry told reporters: The foreign price of wool has not fluctuated at present, because the wool produced in Australia is mainly supplied to the motherland, but the United Kingdom is currently tightening its belt and struggling to overcome difficulties, so the demand is minimal. Moreover, it is currently the wool harvesting season, and the supply is the largest, so the price is stable. However, in the long term, the price will become more expensive because the production of Australian wool is less after the war than before the war.</p>
<h3>Regulations Supplementing the Substitution of Gauze for Printed Cotton</h3>
<p>The Textile Export Committee, in the past, stipulated that printed cotton could be substituted for gauze, with a conversion rate of "1130 pounds of printed cotton for one piece of 20-count yarn or 24 bolts of 10-pound fine cloth." This calculation was based on L.S.S. printed cotton as the standard. However, there are many types of printed cotton, and the name is not limited to this one. The quality varies, and from a trade standpoint, it is inconvenient to have rigid regulations. Now, to promote the export of gauze, facilitate international trade, and reduce all difficulties in transactions, a flexible standard is adopted. In the future, if manufacturers use gauze to substitute for printed cotton, and the grade is higher or lower than the L.S.S. standard, the conversion rate can be freely determined by both parties. However, it must be approved by the committee to inform the Export-Import Control Board for the issuance of export-import licenses.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Northeast Coal Production</h3>
<p>[Via Yang Hang News] In May of this year, the total monthly coal production from the seven mines in Fushun, Zao Xin, Benxi, Yantai, Beipiao, Yingchengzi, and Xi'an exceeded 400,000 tons. After the Communist bandits launched five offensives, in August, the five mines in Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, Yantai, and Yingchengzi were still able to maintain a total monthly production of 300,000 tons. Currently, only Fushun, Yantai, and Benxi are producing, with a total monthly production of only about 150,000 tons, a decrease of 250,000 tons compared to May.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Orders Italian Rayon Over 4,000 Cases to Arrive in Shanghai Soon as Third Quarter Quota Import Goods</h3>
<p>According to sources from the Silk Weaving Industry Association, over 4,000 cases of Italian rayon will arrive in Shanghai soon. This rayon is a quota import commodity for the third quarter and was ordered by the silk weaving industry. The industry will allocate it according to the actual needs of each factory. It is reported that since the war, the industry has largely relied on the allocation of rayon from the China National Trust Corporation's barter trade with Japan, but the supply has been intermittent and the quantity insufficient. The Export-Import Control Board has included rayon in the import quota starting from the third quarter, with a prescribed amount of US$565,000. The remainder is distributed by the industry and rayon merchants. Furthermore, this order of Italian rayon is one of the largest since the war, with only small quantities imported in the past.</p>

<h3>The Improvement and Popularization of Science</h3>
<p>— Pingxi</p>
<p>When people talk about the backwardness of Chinese culture or the slow progress of society, they invariably cite the underdevelopment and inadequate level of science in China as a reason. In fact, it should be said that this is because Chinese science has not been improved or popularized.</p>
<p>Regarding the demand for scientific knowledge in the great cause of national reconstruction, improvement and popularization are two broad avenues that cannot be neglected. We cannot only hope for the improvement of science or only expect the popularization of science, but must simultaneously complete this urgent task from both aspects to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The improvement of science emphasizes the cultivation of specialized talent and the training of special skills, while the popularization of science strives to permeate general scientific knowledge into the daily lives of the people. The improvement of science is not only a national honor but also a contribution to global academia. The popularization of science seems to have little connection with other countries, but in order to improve the national knowledge level and understand the indivisible significance of world culture, there are reasons why it must be vigorously pursued. Between these two, there should be no distinction between priority, no comparison of urgency, and no selection of importance. They must both be proposed and given equal attention.</p>
<p>It has been almost thirty years since the May Fourth Movement, and the call for "science" has been shouted loudly, but the results are unsatisfactory. Speaking of improvement, what important inventions or discoveries have we contributed to the world? Speaking of popularization, the majority of our people are still largely unacquainted with science. This is because the Chinese government and society have not put enough effort into science.</p>
<p>Although the improvement and popularization of science each has its own task and field, they are actually two sides of the same coin. Only in a country where science has been popularized can science achieve brilliant results. And only in a country where science has been improved to a considerable extent can their people universally accept the baptism of science, with no risk of disconnection and no trace of any order of priority. Therefore, the popularization and improvement of science are merely a comprehensive issue, and their degree of development is mutually coordinated.</p>
<p>Why can American science reach such heights? Why can they be the first to discover the great creation of "atomic energy?" It is because their level of science is high, there are many talented people, the research is deep, and scientific knowledge is very popular. In the United States, people of almost any profession and any age have a considerable scientific understanding and scientific training, and most are interested in science. Therefore, there are more people engaged in scientific work, and truth is naturally easier to discover and science naturally progresses quickly with the activities of the majority of hands and brains.</p>
<p>This shows that the improvement and popularization of science must go hand in hand. The higher the level, the easier the popularization. Only with popularization can there be improvement. The relationship between the two is mutually reinforcing. In the past, our country's scientific work has failed to plan for both aspects, resulting in slow progress and failure to meet the needs of the times.</p>
<p>In the future, to develop our country's science, improvement and popularization cannot be neglected. To cultivate highly specialized scientific talents, we must first lay a solid foundation of scientific society. To enable science to play a popularizing role among the people, we must raise the floating standard of science to a higher level. The country should spend a large amount of material and financial resources to establish advanced and perfect research institutions, but it cannot ignore the work of instilling science deep into the people. If we use most of our energy to promote the scientific knowledge of the general public, we must not forget to cultivate specialized talents. This is an educational task and even more so a responsibility of scientific workers.</p>
<h3>The Science of Sleep</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In the process of human life, sleep is of course the most important. A person cannot do without sleep, nor does he want to not sleep, because sleep is of great benefit and help to mankind. It can regulate the spirit, restore brainpower, and make the body and mind healthy. These are the effects of sleep, so sleep is inevitably recognized by people as a necessity.</p>
<p>If you are willing to experiment, you will not go to bed all night. At the time, you may not feel anything, but the next day, you will feel dizzy, sore muscles, weak limbs, and drowsy. The eyes also lose their vitality, as if something is pressing on your head. You will be listless all day long. From this, it can be seen that sleep is indispensable to human beings.</p>
<p>Now, let's first look at the sleep time of each person, which varies in length. Generally, children under two years old usually exceed fifteen hours, three to six years old are over ten hours, and those over six years old are about ten hours. Adults can reduce it to eight hours, and the elderly can reduce it to six hours. Five hours of sleep is sufficient for those over seventy years old. Therefore, we arrive at a conclusion that the amount of sleep time for humans is inversely proportional to age.</p>
<p>But why can you reduce sleep time as you get older? Then why not completely abolish it and not sleep? Theoretically, it can be established. But the reality is not so, so the question comes up: Is sleep necessary for humans?</p>
<p>According to Professor Mass of the University of Washington in the United States, an experiment was conducted with eight male and female students who did not sleep for sixty consecutive hours, but their work efficiency and physical health did not decrease in the slightest.</p>
<p>Although the above experiment cannot determine that sleep can be abolished, it can at least be inferred that sleep is a habit and not necessary for humans. Many other scientists believe that sleep is a habit developed by human ancestors, and later this habit was gradually passed on to us descendants to an unchangeable degree.</p>
<p>However, if we gradually reduce sleep time day by day, then one day we can stay awake all night. This is not impossible, it's just that we don't put it into practice. Above, we already know that the sleep time for adults is eight hours. If we can fall asleep as soon as we go to bed and eliminate all unnecessary wasted time, then sleep time can be reduced to six hours. Wouldn't that be two hours less than usual, but the efficacy is not less than eight hours.</p>
<p>Professor Hollinworth of Columbia University in the United States said that abolishing sleep is very possible. He also has a method, which is that a person who sleeps for eight hours, if they reduce it in short increments of five minutes per month, can completely eliminate it after sixteen years, because such a short time of five minutes per month is not perceived by most people to have any hindrance.</p>
<p>Sleep is really the greatest tragedy of mankind, because it not only deprives you of your freedom, but also wastes your most cherished and precious time. If we calculate it for a forty-year-old person, then he has abandoned ten years of good time in the land of darkness, which is not a pity, even painful.</p>
<p>Then how did our ancestors develop this bad habit? This is because in ancient times, science was certainly out of the question, but there was no discovery of fire, so everything had to rely on sunlight for lighting to start their work. Of course, they could not continue in the dark night, but there was nothing to do, because life was very simple at that time, so they drowsily lay down, and over time, a state of sleep was formed. They continued this state until the discovery of fire, but by that time it had become a habit that could not be changed. They did not change it because people at that time did not know that sleep was a habit, so this bad habit was passed down to the present.</p>
<p>Many other scientists believe that the most important thing to study in order to replace sleep is to restore the activity of brain cells. In this way, people no longer need to use sleep to restore their brainpower.</p>
<p>Brain cells are a complex combination mechanism, and everything in humans is dominated by it, so restoring brain cells is restoring the whole person. If we can invent a machine that, through the action of this machine, or use electric current to change brain cells and restore them to their original state, then sleep will not be needed.</p>
<p>By that time, the word "sleep" will become a historical relic, and life will be lengthened by half out of thin air. A three-year-old child can be sent to school to study, and a ten-year-old person will have the experience of an adult. The bed will become a place for us to rest for a while.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Sleep is a natural physiological phenomenon, and the restoration of fatigue depends entirely on sleep. Whether it can be avoided in the future due to the progress of science is a very interesting question, and there are some factual bases, so it is published here.</p>
<h3>Atomic Dry Battery</h3>
<p>— Who</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with wartime applications, allied scientists devoted themselves to improving ultra-small dry batteries. The most glorious and successful is the Mini-Max dry battery of the American Carbon Company, which has extremely small volume and extremely large power.</p>
<p>The structure of this type of dry battery is different from ordinary ones. The positive electrode is an extremely thin carbon sheet, the negative electrode is a zinc sheet, and there is a pure steel square container containing a mixture of electrolyte and depolarizer. A group of Mini-Max batteries are stacked together and then sealed with thick wax paper into a strip, which becomes a 103-volt atomic dry battery sold on the market.</p>
<h3>Color Wireless Movie</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zuoqing</p>
<p>Wireless movies can be said to be very common in middle and upper class families in the United States, but color wireless movies have only recently been officially and successfully produced. The American Radio Company (RCA) has therefore specially manufactured a new type of television camera to broadcast full-real natural color wireless movies. The machine is all-electronic tube equipment. The light is first focused on the photo, and then divided into three colors and captured into the lens. Scans the three colors of green at high speed. Therefore, each color can be scanned thirty times per second. The receiver then recombines the three colors into full-real natural colors. Ordinary black and white wireless movie receivers can also receive this future color movie if they are equipped with a converter, but the colors are still only black and white. Therefore, the widespread application of future color wireless movies, according to senior officials of the company, still requires considerable time.</p>
<h3>Talking About Wood</h3>
<p>— Tang Yao</p>
<p>Hardwood also has a special type of tubular cell called "Wood Fiber." In most hardwoods, wood fiber is the main part. The function of these fibers is mainly for mechanical support. Its length averages about 1 hao (1/25 inch). The pits of wood fiber have many differences, and there can also be many specialized terms to describe it. Generally speaking, their structure is between the "tracheid" mentioned above and the "wood parenchyma" discussed below.</p>
<p>The wood cells mentioned above are all arranged along the longitudinal axis of the tree. There is also a type of wood cell that is a very short tubular cell called "Wood Ray Parenchyma." Their long axis is arranged along the radial direction of the wood (that is, along the direction of the cross-sectional radius). There are simple pits between their adjacent walls. These cells are still alive and mainly store food. If the cells of the parenchyma are also arranged axially, then it is called wood parenchyma (Wood Parenchyma). These two types of tissues are completely different due to the different direction of cell arrangement, but they must be distinguished clearly.</p>
<p>The structure of various woods can be roughly divided into two types: "softwood," which is mainly composed of tracheids. These cells perform both conduction (earlywood or springwood) and support (latewood or autumnwood). In "hardwood," the division of labor is more precise. Vessels (cross-sectionally called pores) are specially suitable for conduction, and fibers are mainly for mechanical support. As for parenchyma (including wood parenchyma and wood rays), they are mainly used to store food.</p>
<p>The horizontal tissues in the wood are arranged along the radial direction of the wood (that is, along the direction of the diameter on the cross-section), so the symmetry of the wood tissue is only three: 1. Cross section, refers to the surface perpendicular to the main trunk or central axis; 2. Radial section, refers to the section that can contain the pith (Pith) in the center of the wood; 3. Tangential section, refers to the section that is perpendicular to the growth ring or parallel to the pith. Since the various cells in the wood are three-dimensional, in order to observe the structure of any kind of wood and see the longitudinal, transverse, and high aspects of the cell wall, it is necessary to combine the results obtained from the three aspects of the wood, including cross-cutting and longitudinal cutting (including radial cutting and chord cutting), to obtain the whole picture. The wood rays arranged radially, when viewed on the cross-section of the wood, are radial. If the bark is peeled off, you can sometimes see the height of these lines. On the radial cut (that is, sawing open along the center of the wood section), there are many collections of band-like cells (Tibbon-like). When viewed on the cross-section of the tubular cells, only the cross-surface of these tubes is seen, along with the radial wall and tangential wall (because the cut part is different, the size of the same cell can be different on the cross-section). It is necessary to combine the radial and chordal sections to understand the structure of the entire cell wall.</p>
<p>The method of sawing wood sections can be roughly divided into two types: 1. Plain-sawn (Flator slash sawn oi glat grain, refers to sawing the chord surface of the wood section or the direction perpendicular to the radius into a plate shape. 2. Quarter-sawn (Quarter or fift sawn, refers to sawing the wood section along the radial surface, or in a direction close to the wood ray, into a plate shape. These two sawing methods are not completely accurate; because the plates of the plain saw gradually approach the radial from the outside to the inside, and the central part becomes the radial saw. Generally speaking, those on the surface of the plate with a growth ring less than 15 degrees are still called plain-sawn boards, otherwise they are called quarter-sawn boards. The method of sawing wood not only affects labor and materials, but also has a relationship with the same nature and beauty. For example, the wood with very wide wood rays can show a beautiful silver luster on the radially sawn surface. Secondly, the relationship between the method of sawing wood sections and the shrinkage of wood is also very large. For wood panels of the same width, the shrinkage after drying during tangential sawing can be about twice as large as during radial sawing. For example, for a certain wood, the width of the one that has been tangentially sawn is 8.6 cm when wet, and shrinks to 7.9 cm after drying, with a shrinkage rate of 8%; the same width of wood panel, if it is radially sawn, is 8.1 cm after drying, with a shrinkage rate of 5% (the reason is detailed in the shrinkage of wood). In addition, the nature of the wood is also affected by whether it is a chord surface or a radial surface; for example, the force and strength of the wood are also very different in the longitudinal and transverse directions (including the radial and chord surfaces). It can be seen from this that the nature of the wood is greatly related to the direction of cell arrangement.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Wood is an organism that takes decades or hundreds of years to mature. In its long growing season, day after day, year after year, it is constantly affected by the outside world, so the wood of various trees is extremely heterogeneous. For example, the relevant uses, weight, texture, color, etc. are all like this. All kinds of wood are cellular structures. Their composition and arrangement have various differences, so there are various structures for various woods. The good art of a kind of wood mostly depends on its nature. However, the properties of wood are mostly due to the differences in the structure and physical chemistry of wood, so it is better to regard various woods as structures rather than as materials.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Washington is Scolded</h3>
<p>— Zeshi</p>
<p>When Washington retired to his hometown at the end of his second term as president, a newspaper published an article scolding him, saying: "Now is the time to rejoice and clap hands—all those who are closely related to the freedom and happiness of the people should be ecstatic at this moment, because from now on, the name Washington will no longer spread political corruption and publicly recognized incompetence."</p>
<p>Before this, Washington had been scolded to death by the opposition party, and couldn't help but complain: "They scolded me so badly that I was bleeding from the head. Even scolding a rogue, a thief, or a petty thief isn't like this."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Washington was one of the founding fathers of the American Revolution, and devoted himself to national affairs for many years. Who knew that on the day he retired, a dignified newspaper would celebrate the people's freedom and happiness with his "get out." It can be seen that no matter what kind of person, praise and slander at the moment are inevitable. It is difficult to determine what is right and wrong until after the coffin is closed; no, it is difficult to determine even after the coffin is closed.</p>
<p>Moreover, the bigger the person, the more opportunities to be scolded. For example, when I only had one child and he was only three years old, I was very well received by him. Whenever I asked him "Is Dad good?", his answer must be "Good! Dad is good! Good Dad!" Now this child is thirteen years old and has a group of younger siblings. I dare not ask "Is Dad good?" anymore. Sometimes when I ask, he usually just smiles and doesn't answer. This cannot be blamed on him. First, I can no longer satisfy his desires. Even if prices do not rise and my income does not decrease, he can only get at most one-fifth of a bag of fruit candies, which is not as much as he got all of it when he was three years old; second, I am increasingly concerned about his studies and character, and inevitably have to offer advice from time to time, which he cannot accept, because my earnest words may be seen as nonsense to him. And in fact, not only does he slowly disrespect me, but even the younger children do not consistently support me. This is also understandable for them, because on the one hand, I take it as my responsibility to raise and discipline them, and on the other hand, it is difficult for me to fully fulfill their needs. Therefore, I realized that to be a good father, one must not have too many children, so I deeply feel that it is difficult to manage a family, let alone govern a country.</p>
<p>The second reason why great people are necessarily greatly scolded is that it is difficult for any great person to "live up to everyone's expectations." I would even think that my skills are no different from Hitler or Mussolini, because if I were the leader of the Third Reich, or wore a black shirt and became the prime minister of the Roman Empire today, at worst, I would only end up with the country broken and myself dead. Could there be anything worse than them? Therefore, I look down on great people of the past and present, and of course there are millions of people in the world who do so. However, I have a good temper and am humble, so I don't scold great people, and I certainly don't want to replace them. But if someone looks down on great people as much as I do, but is more ambitious than me, then chaos will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is inevitable that great people will be scolded. The way to deal with it is: Okay, you scold me fiercely enough, then I'll let you be a great person, and you let people scold you. History says that Washington's unwillingness to run for a third term as president was because he didn't want to be scolded again, and his successor, John Adams, was indeed scolded to death even more.</p>
<h3>Birthday</h3>
<p>— Jill</p>
<p>Every morning after getting up, my wife asks me as usual what dishes I want to eat, so that she can make a few palatable dishes at noon for a small meal. This can be considered a little consolation for living a poor civil servant's life, because I can be considered a believer who is particular about eating. Today, my wife suddenly asked me what dishes to use, and then I suddenly realized that my birthday had arrived again.</p>
<p>Really, if my wife didn't remind me, I wouldn't remember my birthday. I don't care about my birthday. I think most people feel the same way now. I don't know what the basis is for having to eat on a birthday. Perhaps people in the south usually eat rice, and eating it for a long time can easily lead to beriberi due to a lack of vitamin B, so they use birthdays to change the taste. This may have the same effect as eating taro, dumplings, or wontons in my hometown on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month every year, but perhaps the latter also contains summer hygiene, taking it easy to digest, it is not necessarily.</p>
<p>I also don't know what the basis is for having to celebrate a birthday according to the lunar calendar. Although the solar calendar has long been designated as the national calendar, it is very convenient for children born now to calculate their birthdays according to the national calendar, but how many children celebrate their birthdays according to the national calendar? On the contrary, many children count both the lunar and solar calendars, so this child is blessed and can celebrate two birthdays.</p>
<p>Whenever it is someone's birthday, there are naturally people who hold banquets to celebrate, wishing them a long life, and having a big celebration, but there are also people who just swallow an egg, counting it as a year "rolling" by. But if you are in a bad mood and life is tight, then just simply forget about it, and the birthday is equal to nothing. Accordingly, I am still lucky to have someone remind me.</p>
<p>Some people eat vegetarian food on their birthdays, such as eating vegetarian noodles, saying that the day is "Mother's Day," and eating vegetarian food is "repaying mother's kindness." Although it is a bit of Buddhist thought, it is also reasonable. The relationship between people and their parents is probably mostly just a financial relationship. If they can remember it once a year and eat vegetarian food for their mother for a day, then that would be very meaningful. When everyone can calculate their birthday according to the national calendar, and everyone can regard their birthday as "Mother's Day," perhaps the world can be at peace.</p>
<h3>Talking About Wine in Yue</h3>
<p>— Yicun</p>
<p>Mr. Ping writing about drinking wine (Six-Day Liberty Forum) can be said to be "wine meets a kindred spirit," for which, a big cup! Indeed, wine is a very important factor from the beginning, but Shaoxing after the disaster is not as beautiful as imagined or longed for. Eight years in prison not only resulted in the trees being cut down so that they were no longer "Yin" (shady), but "this" road was also damaged to the point of being difficult to travel; the only thing that is somewhat comforting is that the winemaking business is recovering day by day.</p>
<p>Shaoxing is indeed a wine country. Not only does every village have someone making wine, but also six or seven out of ten farmers have home-brewed wine. Those who brew a lot of wine have thousands of jars, and those who brew little can even brew a bowlful. Yellow wine is not necessarily only brewed in Shaoxing. Places like Suzhou and other places also have many Shaoxing people setting up workshops to brew wine, but it is still not as good as Shaoxing's products. The reason is the natural water. Jian Lake meanders for thirty miles, and its clarity and sweetness are exceptionally good. The water for brewing wine is taken from Jian Lake, but it is limited to a few sections to be useful. According to experiments, taking water from two locations at the same time to weigh it, the weight will differ by a lot. This is probably because certain streams contain minerals.</p>
<p>The famous Shaoxing wine-producing areas are the three "Tai" places, namely Ruanshe (the hometown of Ji Kang), Dongpu, and Hutang. There are countless wineries there. Every time during the early spring winemaking season, the air is filled with the aroma of wine, making people feel a little tipsy just by breathing it in.</p>
<p>Speaking of products, outsiders only know "Beijing-packaged" and "Huadiao." In fact, they cannot be considered the best. In Shaoxing, there are "Bamboo Leaf Green" (pure wine without added color), "Gan Chen" (new wine with added color), "Zhuangyuan Hong" (aged wine), "Jia Fan" (a type with heavier raw materials), etc. These are common; better ones are "Shan Niang" (re-brewing wine using wine instead of water), "Fuqiao Wine," and special brews specifically for non-official use as gifts or commemorative items. Some aged wines have been aged for decades and have become like clear water; there is also a type called "Jiu Xue" (Wine Snow), which is brewed with liquor as water and heavy materials, light green, sweet, and mellow. One small cup will make you drunk, making it an even more rare treasure for people in the wine country.</p>
<p>Speaking of drinking wine, it is not necessarily because it is a producing area that people are good at drinking; it is just more common. Many winery owners only drink a tiny bit, while farmers and workers drink four or five times a day, which has become a medicine for them to recover from fatigue. There are many who only drink wine from morning to night, eat little rice, and are perpetually drunk, who are nicknamed "Drunken Idlers"; as for those who can be called "Bull Drinkers," it is the workers in the wineries. When they feel busy, thirsty, hungry, or tired, they dip their heads into any vat and swallow a mouthful. They don't need any appetizers; they wipe their faces with their sleeves and go back to work. This is called "Looking in the Big Mirror."</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about buying wine. On the roads of Shanyin, you don't have to worry about finding wine everywhere, and the prices are cheap, but you can't buy good wine because the selling point here depends entirely on added water (people who are used to drinking it don't find it strange). If you want to buy good wine, you have to put in some effort. "Which one is good?" "Which one is newly opened?" People in Shaoxing ask each other like this. Those wealthy people who come to Shanyin Road to "crowd around" even need to "ask about local customs upon entering the area!"</p>
<h3>Hair Identification Method</h3>
<p>— Hezhe</p>
<p>Although people's faces are different, it is often difficult to identify them, so someone invented the fingerprints to identify them. The judicial circles are now quite using this method. All the thieves and criminals are called to print a hand mold. According to the type of texture, compiled into the number, recorded in the book, where has committed a crime only need to put his hand mold number on the book to check, let him how to deny, how to disguise, also can not escape.</p>
<p>Hair has the same effect as fingerprints. Experts in criminal science have long adopted this identification method to supplement the lack of fingerprints and increase the effectiveness of identification. According to scientific research, people's hair, under a very strong microscope, has very fine scales, similar to fish scales. The center of the hair is hollow, containing colored substances.</p>
<p>According to scientists, no two people have exactly the same hair structure. The points of hair identification are the thickness of the hair, the size of the central tube, the size of the scales, and the nature of the hair surface. Therefore, the judicial circles have one more tool for dealing with criminals.</p>
<h3>Portrait</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>Female customer: "Who told you to paint me so ugly? Look, this portrait is simply painting a hippopotamus! I can't pay."</p>
<p>Painter: "Madam, why didn't you think about it before you told me to paint it?"</p>
<p>Welcoming the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was partly cloudy, and I was invited by Mr. Zhan Yuesheng and others to a banquet on the Jiangya Wheel to welcome the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe. It was a grand occasion, so I wrote a poem to record it.</p>
<p>Half a day sailing on the Huangpu River,</p>
<p>A grand banquet is extraordinary:</p>
<p>The wind is clear and the clouds are light, the songs are far,</p>
<p>The sea is vast and the sky is wide, the laughter is cool;</p>
<p>Meeting like old friends for the first time,</p>
<p>Wishing Xinjiang safe and sound;</p>
<p>In the future, when we go west of Yangguan,</p>
<p>We will raise our cups together.</p>
<h3>On Minor Disappointments</h3>
<p>— Heku</p>
<p>Disappointed people often have an idiom in their minds, called "Things in life are seldom completely satisfactory," which is a bit too pessimistic about life. If more than 80% of things are unsatisfactory, can it still be considered that humans can conquer nature? For example, if there are two roads ahead: one is the road to happiness, and the other is the road to sorrow. When you choose, of course, you won't take the road to sorrow. Also, if there are two bowls of soup in front of you, one is bitter medicine and the other is sweet milk, of course, you like to drink milk. When we start walking or drinking soup, we have already decided to choose the happy and satisfying things to start with. Then the idiom "Things in life are seldom completely satisfactory" is not valid because people will never choose to do unsatisfactory things first, unless that person is an idiot.</p>
<p>However, in your life, you will inevitably encounter some minor disappointments, inevitably chasing after you, making you feel annoyed and worried. Perhaps the fountain pen in your pocket was inadvertently stolen by a thief when you were getting on a public bus; perhaps after happily holding chrysanthemums, you feel that your stomach has been upset and you have diarrhea all night; perhaps when you entrusted someone to send a beloved gift to a distant person, the entrusted person lost it on the way... All of these belong to the category of minor disappointments in life, which are unavoidable. Although they do not cause you to feel intense frustration, the situation is similar to being stung by a wasp, a bit painful and a bit swollen, but it will not harm your overall health.</p>
<p>It is said that this is the twist and turns of life. The ideal state of smooth sailing is often difficult to reach. There must be some twist and turns, and the twist and turns are experience, making your life more complete and satisfactory. You must lose the first fountain pen and buy the second one to understand the true meaning of "cherishing things"; you must have an upset stomach after eating crabs for the first time to know how to chew carefully and eat in moderation. It is regrettable that the accumulation of life experience is indeed a lot, but there are more novel experiences because the complexity of dusty affairs makes it impossible to find a constant "constant" of experience that can be applied to various encounters. Therefore, minor disappointments are seen repeatedly, not just once.</p>
<p>Today, my wife was very happy to have sold two pounds of wool, ready to make a wool shirt for me, but she forgot to bring it back on the rickshaw, so she felt annoyed. I can only use the above meaning to comfort her.</p>
<p>Among the New Year's greetings, there is a sentence "May all your wishes come true". Can all things truly be as one wishes? Therefore, the end of the greeting is just a greeting, alas.</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Onstage and Offstage (15)</p>
<p>It was not until he got off work at five o'clock that Zhuzhai made a decision. Since he had agreed, he should go. He hired a car to the North China Restaurant. On the way, he thought of many things to say, preparing to deal with the meeting. He didn't expect that when he arrived at the North China Restaurant, Qiyun was already waiting in the private room. When she met him, she only smiled and said, "You are really busy. I've been here for a while. Why didn't you come to my house this morning?" Zhuzhai was about to stammer when Qiyun asked again, "Was the lady sitting on the east side last night your wife?" Zhuzhai's heart was pounding like a drum, afraid that she would question him. He said awkwardly, "Yes, she usually doesn't go out much. She is an old-fashioned wife and doesn't know anything about the outside world. Last night, because you asked her to go, I pulled her out." Qiyun said, "I thought your wife must be very beautiful and very refined. I wanted to take this opportunity to meet her." Zhuzhai said, "What's so beautiful about her? She doesn't even have any common sense and is too ignorant." Zhuzhai said these words to explain Fengsheng's slip of the tongue last night. Unexpectedly, Qiyun frowned when she heard this and shook her head slightly, saying, "Things in the world are never perfect. This is also a regret for you. How did you get to know her in the first place?" Zhuzhai said, "She is the third daughter of my aunt. The one who proposed marriage to me back then was her eldest sister, not her. Her eldest sister was well-educated, very lively, and also beautiful. Later, she went to Shanghai to study and suddenly changed her mind and ran away with someone else. Her father thought that everyone knew about our marriage, and it wouldn't sound good if it got out, so he wanted to marry his third daughter, who is now my wife, to me. I didn't want to, but my father insisted on it. I opposed this matter several times and even hid in Jinan once. My uncle persuaded me to come back, saying that if I opposed it again, I would make my father angry to death. I was forced by family pressure and finally surrendered." Qiyun nodded and said with great emotion, "These old ethical concepts in China, if they are not broken, will really mislead people! Your marital experience is the same as my father's. My father was originally engaged to my maternal aunt. Later, my maternal aunt ran away. To save face, my maternal grandmother had my mother play the role of my maternal aunt and marry him. Later, my father found out and had no good feelings for my mother. He would make an issue out of everything. Even after my mother had children, my father was still constantly angry with my mother because of this problem. The couple could never be harmonious, which made my mother unwilling to be with my father. She hid in Shanghai all year round, believed in Buddhism, and chanted scriptures. Even when she was old, her feelings could not be reconciled. In this way, we children are too difficult in the family!" Zhuzhai listened and felt a sense of mutual sympathy. He felt sad in his heart, holding the remaining brandy in his glass, and didn't know what to say for a while. Then Qiyun said again, "Today, I heard you say these words, and I feel the same. I hope you don't have a temper like my father. My mother's experience is very pitiful!" Zhuzhai listened and remained silent.</p>
<h3>Talking About Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Since the news of the police in Shijiazhuang reached Pingjin, for half a month, the obvious changes in North China have been the soaring prices, the rampant black market for gold banknotes, and many rumors. Generally, people open their mouths "Shimen!" and close their mouths "Shimen!" It's really a bit of panic. What is the status and relationship of Shimen in the overall situation in North China? They have no systematic research, but just unconscious hesitation.</p>
<p>Although Shijiazhuang belongs to Huolu County and is close to Zhengding (less than twenty miles due south of Zhengding, and forty or fifty miles west of Huolu), it used to be quite lively, but it is a large village town in terms of local characteristics. Although it is located on the road from Beijing to Wuhan, it is standing in Zhengding, followed by Luancheng. The distance between "Zheng" and "Le" is only one stop, only sixty miles apart, and Shizhuang is located in between, but a "tea tip" is a small place to stay, and no one pays attention to it. When the Qing Dynasty built the Beijing-Hankou (Pinghan) Railway, it was built along the old post road. Shizhuang is a small station south of Zhengding. However, for the west road, this village is just due east of Niangziguan. Since the formation of the Zhengtai Railway, the face has become important. That is, the section from Zhengding to Shizhuang is still the Pinghan Line, from Shizhuang to the west to Huolu, not Xing, but Niangziguan, to reach Taiyuan, so the so-called "Zhengtai" is actually "Shitai". "Shitai" and "Pinghan" form a "T" shape, and Shizhuang is at the intersection, which is the central station for coal transportation between Jin and Hebei.</p>
<p>The impression of the relationship between Shizhuang and the overall situation occurred in the winter of Xinhai. When the Wuhan Revolutionary Army rose, Wu Luzhen stationed troops here to prevent the Qing army from going south, and echoed with Zhang Shaozeng in Qizhou. He was really so-called "绾　中樞", which was crucial. Yuan Shikai sent someone to assassinate Wu, and then the soldiers of the Third Town were able to drive straight into Niangziguan. At that time, the military importance of Shijiazhuang was unparalleled. The place name is gradually known to the world.</p>
<p>The two major trunk lines south of Beiping, one Tianjin-Pukou and one Pinghan, are winding for thousands of miles, shaped like parallel lines. A transverse connecting line is needed in the middle. Therefore, the Ministry of Posts and Communications of the former Qing Dynasty had a plan to build the "Cangshi Road". (Cangzhou of Jinpu Line travels west to Shizhuang), and then because the Shanghai Sea Road of northern Jiangsu has been Xuzhou Zhengzhou, it has been extended. Until the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese invaders invaded North China and took holding the railway as the "national policy" to control the five provinces in the north. The Chahar Political Affairs Committee was established, advocating economic cooperation. The first major requirement was to build the Cangyou Railway. Although Song Zheyuan perfunctory in every way, he insisted that it was impossible on this matter and avoided living in Leling. The "July 7th" Incident broke out as a result.</p>
<p>After the fall of North China, the puppet "Provisional Government" was established, and the enemy established the so-called "North China Transportation Co., Ltd.", a monster like its South Manchurian Railway, and immediately began to build the "Deshi Railway". The reason why "Cangshi" was changed to "Deshi" was because Dezhou was on the northeast side of the east and bordering Hebei Province. It is more important to be on the Jinpu Line 380 miles south of Cangzhou, and more than 200 miles south is Jinan, which connects to the Jiaoji Railway to link to the Qingdao port, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Japanese people in doing this is still mainly economic. The western neighbor of Shizhuang is the famous Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei. Further west is the Baiyan Coal and Zhazi Coal from the west, and the Zibo Coal Mine and Iron Mine east of Jinan are all connected. The resources of North China are completely in control. The ambition for decades has come true. Unexpectedly, evil is full, and after eight years, it surrendered completely and lost all. After China took over, the people with the "共" brand continued to rise, and their goal was to destroy. In the past two years, it has been dismantled section by section and destroyed segment by segment. The Deshi Road, which the Japanese people had worked hard to build, has no complete country, and even the Pinghan Road, an old trunk line of many years, is in a mess. First, Shijiazhuang and Baoding were not camel-like, and then the planes between Beiping and Baoding were also flying back and forth. The so-called Shimen, which connects the four directions, has long become a "light pole peony" that is exposed and has no support and whose limbs are all broken. Those who guarded it before could not keep it, so how can those who have it now be used as a base for attacking other places!</p>
<p>What's ridiculous is that the "nervous" theorists in the Pingjin area tell each other in a moving way. It's not that the other side has obtained this, can enter Shanxi to the west, can attack Baoding to the north, and can do something to the east and south. That is to say, Baoding has lost its barrier and is in danger. These dull brains and stereotyped arguments can be said to be completely unconscious. This kind of speculation, if it were in the era of Wu Luzhen, would still be possible, because the railway at that time was complete and the war was linear. Wu's occupation of Shizhuang would make it possible to attack Baoding to the north and take Shanxi to the west. But now the other side has always used guerrilla tactics, a scattered and multifaceted formation, and does not need to occupy Shizhuang before attacking Baoding. Moreover, before Shizhuang was lost, Baoding had already been in a battle of offense and defense all around. The car between Ping and Bao has long been out of service. What does it have to do with the gains and losses of Shizhuang's isolated city? Moreover, the north-south and east-west railway and highway in Zhuangzao has been destroyed by them, so at this time, how can there be ready-made transportation tools for them to transport! Therefore, the gains and losses of Shizhuang, in the past two years (that is, after the four-sided traffic has been cut off), are in no way a decisive victory or defeat.</p>
<p>However, the loss of Shizhuang has stimulated the nerves of ordinary people, which has its own reasons. Because Shizhuang has been painstakingly managed by Japan for several years, it has become a modern metropolis. Factories, newspaper offices, shopping malls, airports, theaters, government offices, schools, and banks are all newly built. With the money they squeezed, the streets are wide and tidy, the buildings are magnificent, and merchants from all directions gather, creating a false prosperity. Famous actors from Pingjin also often go to perform, and the major merchants send branches one after another. In the past, the cities in Hebei Province were "Pingjinbao" as the "three major ones", but now with Beiping as the center, Tianjin still ranks first in the east road, followed by Tangshan, and Shizhuang ranks first in the west road, while Baoding is below it. The only large city on the Pinghan Line, once lost, is said to have been baptized by artillery fire and become a ruin. This kind of news stimulates the nerves of the northern masses, which is naturally different from the offense and defense of other cities and towns.</p>
<p>However, in fact, in the other party's strategy, it is only a kind of nervous offensive. If you look at it as Shizhuang in the era of Wu Luzhen and make the routine of historians that you can take a certain place to the north, capture a certain place to the west, how to do something to the east, and how to do something to the south, then it is completely in line with the dull scholars' discussion of the real situation.</p>
<p>Let's take Fu Zuoyi's recovery of Zhangjiakou last year as a counter-evidence. The reason why the right is of great importance in military strategy is that Suichang is advancing eastward from Gui. It has always been "steady and steady", with a linear advancing posture, and it is based on the main strategy of building one step at a time. The value of obtaining Zhangtan lies not in the recovery of this one place, but in stabilizing the Ping Sui Railway, flexing the muscles of the overall northwest, and forming a high-level advantage. In other words, if the army is also scattered guerrillas and scorched earth warfare, then the occupation of this one place is just an isolated city ruin. Can it be like the current dignified new Great Wall wall?</p>
