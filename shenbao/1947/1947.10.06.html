<p>〔央社南京五日電〕據悉，關於少數黨派參加大選及地方民意機構兩問題，民社。靑年兩黨刻正與國民黨方面繼續協商中。此事迄今雖尙未獲得全部協議，惟其　結並非原則的，而乃按術方面之困難云。（民靑兩黨書面談話內容見第二版第七欄）</p>

<h3>推行睦鄰政策　中蒙國境平靜　傳作義稱榆林亦安謐</h3>

<p>〔本報北平五日電〕傅作義巡視楡林歸來稱，楡林目前尙安謐，惟陝北共匪根據地移葭縣後，楡林自當提高警覺。八月上旬共匪全力攻楡，傷亡達萬餘人，最近是否有再犯楡林企圖，不得而知。另據楡林來平高級將領談，楡林外　據點陸續收復，國軍兵力雖單薄，而士氣則極旺盛，神木始終由國軍堅守，惟高家寨在匪軍手中，故仍感受威脅。寗夏國軍刻在三邊一帶，月前楡林之戰，匪軍兩度衝入，戰况之烈可與龍潭之役相比。匪軍裝備頗優，除山砲，泊　砲，平射砲外，尙有蘇式機槍，砲火聲明晰可辨。</p>

<h3>監察院正式公布　外滙使用報吿書</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕監察院五日公布長達一萬五千餘字之「外匯使用及各公司　業報吿情形報吿書」，對於卅四年八月十九日以迄本年八月底，我國外匯使用及全國人士所矚目之各大公司經營進出口貿易情形，均有一詳盡而確實之前列。按本年三月間，國內外各報會不斷　有「官辦商行」，如一統公司，孚中公司，中國建設銀公司等，有利用「特權」結購鉅額外匯，輸入大量　禁品情事，引起中外商人不滿及各方之指摘，嗣經國民黨中央執行委會及中監委會函監察院澈查，經該院派監察委員杜光　，何漢文，谷鳳翔，王冠吾，審計部審計萬　斌，協審陳華元，向京滬有關機關及公司調査，費時二十餘日，大體完竣，擬具報吿書呈院，並已由監院轉呈國府核辦。該報吿書首先追溯卅四年八月十九日起，以迄卅六年八月十七日止之政府關於外匯管制及機構之演變情形，繼乃報吿各期使用外匯之數量，計：　卅四年八月十九日至卅五年三月三日，為美金六千四百二十萬零八百四十五元九角五分（各種外幣折合數）。　卅五年三月四日至卅六年二月十五日，爲美金四億零一百六十六萬三千五百零一元九角三分，英金一千七百六十三萬五千五百六十四鎊，港幣二千七百八十七萬四千七百六十九元一角三分。　卅六年二月十六日至同年八月卅日，為美金一億五千萬元。　　三公司結購外匯及經營貿易情形</p>
<p>報吿　　乃逐一按陳各大公　結購外匯及經營進出口貿易之情形　訐：，　孚中公司結匯，計美金一百五十八萬五千零八十六元零九分，自　外　十三萬七千八百十七元四角三分，但進口物資有半牧均爲汽車，並認該公司與紐約分公司職權不淸，頗滋　　。　揚子公司已結購外匯美金二百八十二萬零四百十一元零三分英金二萬一千零四士一鎊，瑞　　四萬五千三百卅三法郞，未結外　　金九十萬三千六百八十四元七角二分，英金一千三百八十六鎊。其進口物資，雖多爲棉花及藥品，但該公司與美國揚子貿易公司間名義上分立之關係，　費硏究。　中國建設銀公司結購外匯八百七十七元六角二分，確係購置公司日常辦公用具，尙無浪費鉅額外匯情事，惟　吿　中透路一饒有趣味之消息，即該公司本期營業虧損達國幣一億四千二百七十萬零一千七百八十一元。宋子文氏名　之投資，計為戰前幣値廿五萬元。至是，報吿書並指出上述公司負責人員利用外交護照，在美從事貿易活動之價相，列舉孚中公司總經理宋子良，會以考察交通專使名義，該公司協理沈鶴年，曾以宋前外長隨從秘書名義，中國銀公司總經理宋　安，會以軍事委員會侍從室侍從秘書名義先後出國，迄今未歸。</p>

<p>此長篇報吿　於詳舉上述調査所得之　　後，提出下列八點結論及建議，提供政府　處之根據，採擇之參考：　政府原存黃金六百萬盎斯，美金九億元，乃不二年而大半消耗於非建設物資之進口，幣制旣未能改革，物價亦未能穩定，其措施乘方處，應由宋前院長子文負其責。　外匯管制機構及辦法，朝令夕改，使人民無所適從，今後應有更周密之決策。　今後進口應擴大日用品，而嚴禁消費品。　國外興論對我進出口貿易辦法之指　，或由於不明　相，或由於惡意誇張，考諸實際，所謂排斥外商，實無根據。　工商企業界，’士參加中央最高經濟決策機稱，洩　國策，今後殊應注意。　交通，金城，中國國貨三銀行，投資經營中國建設銀公司，有　銀行業務規章，財部應予分別議處。　各大公司負責人利用名義，在外國從事貿易，應吊銷其護照。　未准進口而刻已到埠之進口物資，應從速處理。（報吿書全文見二版第一　）</p>

<h3>否決權與我國的外交政策</h3>
<p>據報傳消息，我國代表團已向聯合國大會提出建議：「凡當和解國際爭執時，安全理事會應卽自動放棄其否決權，但不主張修改聯合國憲章，而僅要求明定自動放棄否決權之性質。」另據中央社電訊，則謂我國建議，料將遭蘇聯之反對，因蘇聯堅決拒絕考慮「無權而變更」安理會否決權，其餘三强代表則至今未加正式評論。此項消息的傳來，與我國主張對日和約保留否決權的要求，似乎不免有些矛盾。我國對日和約主張保留否決權，似與蘇聯的觀點較爲接近，而此次向聯大所提的建議，限制否決權使用的範圍，則又與蘇聯的政策相左；因而若干政論家以爲我國沒有明確的外交政策。我們認爲在這個時候，對於我國的外交國策，確有約略闡明的必要。</p>
<p>首先我們要指出的就是對日和約否決權的保留，和聯大安理會否決權使用的限制　，根本的兩事。對日和約的發訂，非聯合國組織分內事，故對日和約否決權的保留，與聯大安理會否決公使用的限制，決不能混爲一談。關於對日和約，國民參政會及外交部的對日和約審議委員會，都曾經過愼重的考慮，均認爲對日和會須有蘇聯參加，和會中四强並須保留否決權。因爲中國與日本地域接近，遭受日本軍閥之侵略，歷時旣久，爲害尤烈，爲了自身安全，不容日本侵略主義的再燃，故於對日和約特別關心，而中蘇之間還有許多問題待決，更不能讓蘇聯置身於和約之外。中國對日和約決策，在外形上雖或與蘇聯相近似，郤完全基於獨立的立塲，其意義未必同於蘇聯。至關於否決權問題，張行政院長於本年九月九日在國民黨四中全會席上就指出：「中國主張不應根本修改憲章，取消否決權，但認爲應設法成立一合理之解釋，限制其濫用。」五外長於飛美出席聯合國大會所發表之聲明，關於聯合國安理會的否決權問題，亦曾指出：「我政府以如此一重要問題之解決，在於就憲章中所定之否決權設法成立一般合理之解釋，取得各方協議，而不在憲章本身之修正，且修改憲章在目前亦殊鮮實現可能。」可見我國不主張修改聯合國憲章，但採取對安理會否決權使用的限制，原是一貫的政策。我們於此要特別指出的就是：安理會否決權使用的限制，與安理會否決權的廢止是兩事。我們主張的是：安理會强國否決權的使用應受限制，以防其濫；這不是說我們主張廢棄安理會的否決權制度，也不是說我們主張在安理會放棄否決權的使用。這是很重要的一點。</p>
<p>講到我們的對外國策，則自有其一貫的主張和堅定的立塲。它可以歸納到四個大字，就是中正和平。王外長於去年二月在渝參政會席上，曾指出我們的對外國策：「在盡我們的力量，增進聯合國的團結，尤其諸大國的團結。爲達到這個目的，第一我們不蹈襲傳統的外交策略，聯絡任何一國或任何集團，以對抗其它國家。第二，我們遇事嚴守正義的立塲，是則是，非則非。」張行政院長於國民黨四中全會席上，亦曾指出：「我國外交基本要求是爭取世界和平，使中國獲得安定與建設的機會；政府一面要盡力維持自身和各主要盟邦的友好關係，另一面要擁護聯合國來促進主要列强的合作。」惟其因爲我們的對外國策爲中正和平，所以我們一方面擁護聯合國這一國際組織，促進主要列强的合作，以維繫世界的和平，一方面要盡力維持自身和各主要盟邦間的友好關係。基於此一國策，中國的對外關係無所謂親蘇，無所謂親美，更無所謂反蘇或反美，尤其不會今天好像親美反蘇，明天又像親蘇反美。最近若干美國政論家或以爲中國將以親蘇姿態對美有所「嚇詐」「要挾」，這種論調，固然或係因孫副主席的個人談話而引起的誤會，但也可以看出他們對於中國的對外國策，似乎還沒有正確的認識。同時蘇聯方面的論調，則以爲中國親美反策：我們願站在中正的立塲，以謀世界的和平。在講到中國的對外政策時，本報社論曾經指出：「凡與我友好的各民族，我們都與之爲友。中國二千年來的儒家傳統，祇知道忠信篤敬，親仁善鄰……。」這就是我們中正的立塲。</p>
<p>至於維護領土和主權的完整，這是任何獨立國家所必具的決策，它本身並不足爲構成對外政策的主體。在過去，因爲有不平等條約的存在，我們民族運動的一個目的，便在廢除這些不平等條約，以確保我領土和主權的完整。故在一九一九年的巴黎和會和一九二一年的華盛頓會議，我國的努力都朝着此一方向。目前因爲中蘇友好條約未曾忠實招待，所以關於此一方面，尚有待於我們的繼續努力。我們一向維護條約的尊嚴，所以我們要求中蘇友好條約的實現，中國固願遵守條約的義務，但如果蘇聯有不遵守，我們必定據理力爭。這是我們對蘇政策的骨幹。至於中國對美，更不必說，自願鞏固而且增進兩國傳統的友誼。美國在戰時與我並肩作戰，戰後遺俘受降，更給我不少幫助，今後在國際政治上，中美互相合作的機會必到處可遇，我們斷無輕易受人離間之理。惟美國盟友好華情形，有些看法相當正確，可爲我自反自動的藥石，但對於中國戰時勝利以還所遭遇之困難，往往因別有用心者的誇大宣傳，未必完全了解。故中國對美必須更有求兩國間之相互了解，以加强其合作的盟誼，尤無待言，在美國方面，其對華政策如何，是否將杜魯門主義及馬歇爾援歐計劃的精神延展到中國，那是美國自身的事，美國的政府和人民，在經過了世界第二次大戰以後，必定能根據經騐，知所抉擇，我們無須在此作越俎庖的策劃。</p>

<h3>監院報告書全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕監察院五日公布之監察委員杜光塤等及會同審計部審計萬榮斌等所呈「外匯使用及各公司營業情形調查報告書」，全文如下：</p>
<p>我國自抗戰勝利以後，對外交通及貿易關係，均告恢復，且戰後百廢待興，而政府財政極爲困難，物價日高，通貨膨脹，因此，外匯問題逐成爲國民經濟及財政金融上之一重大問題，各方人士均極爲注意，而財政當局不惟對於外匯之設施管理迭有變更，且於外匯之使用實况與數字，又始終保持秘密，不能使外界了解。因此，傳說紛紜，責雖日起，本年三月初，國防最高委員會第二二三次常務會議，因張委員繼等之提議，決議「凡已經政府核准之外匯案件，交監察院飭審計部詳　其報」，當由院令審計部及監察委員杜光塤等審查，當以未能調聞金　，無法詳查，致本案情形未獲充備之公開報告。本年三月十三日合眾上海訊稱：中國國營　　，頃購有價值數十萬美元之　口費，而絕不中美私人間　自美　十一月以來所受結匯限額及進口條例等限制。據悉：一統公司，中央信託局及中國供應局現正在大量「奢侈品」搬運進口，如高價汽車·無綫電機·冰　及其他中國當避忌所嚴厲禁止進口之　　。而私人商行數千件進口許可證及結匯之請求書，擬以急需之合法進口貨如重工業器材等物，則爲當局置之不理。又據航運界人士證實，此項奢侈品，大部份爲政府有關之商行所定購，供應私人買戶，且傳係爲政府機關人員所定購，獲利以飽私囊。中國商界人士指稱，一統公司係中央信託局之代理人，以低價定購外國貨物，轉售予私人商行時，徵收佣金百分之一，中美商行因此獲利甚微，不敷開支，致難於「官辦」商行競爭。中美商人對們宋子良所支持之孚中公司，宋子安之中國建設銀公司及孔令侃之揚子建設公司，皆可利用「特權」經營商業等情，尤多指摘之詞，例如孚中公司有代表一人，利用中國外交官之護照，現正在美國從事商業上之旅行，而一般有經驗之中國商界領袖欲赴美國，則常不能獲得准許，最近華盛頓與紐約之美國商行，對上述「特權商行」已曾向國務院提出抗議，指斥彼等利用政治及其他壓力，欲將外商排出中國。在華之美國商界領袖，雖多不願公開加以討論，但多襲亦承認一月前所抵抗議情形現仍存在，并認爲改善之希望極微云。本年七月一日，紐約下午報復刊載合眾社中國區經　倫　爾通訊，對我國進口貿易情形，亦有類似之指摘（見觀察第二卷第廿二期），同時，國內各報紙雜誌，更相競刊載關於政府使用外匯浪費及孚中，揚子等進出口貿易公司利用特權，套取外匯，購買奢侈品消息，委員等奉命澈查，經向各院部調閱本案有關卷宗，并赴上海向銀行，進出口貿易公司及海關分別搜集資料，稽核賬目，并徵詢各方意見，茲將調查所獲各項情形及根據各項材料加以分析研究所得之結論，分別報告如下：</p>
<p>第一　調查事實</p>
<p>（甲）外匯管理機構之演變</p>
<p>國民政府管理外匯機構，自廿七年三月中央銀行開始成立外匯審核處以來，其組織屢有變遷，廿七年七月財政部貿易委員會設立外匯處，廿八年四月財政部復成立外匯審核委員會，廿八年十月四聯總處又設匯兌處，三十年九月行政院設置外匯管理委員會及平準基金委員會，卅二年一月外匯管理委員會改隸財政部，卅四年四月十六日，外匯管理委員會奉令撤銷，原有該會職掌，除一部份仍歸財政部辦理外，關於申請購買之審核，出口結匯之處理，外匯市塲之控制，及外匯管理之調查研究等事項，均移交中央銀行辦理，於該項業務局內，設置外匯科及外匯管理科。關於申請購買外匯案件，初由該行總裁孔祥熙親自核辦，計自同年五月十四日至六月八日，先後由孔氏自美電令核准外匯案件三〇二件，共合美金二·六九〇·一〇四·九三元。嗣電呈主席核准，於該行內另設外匯審核委員會，卅四年六月十六日成立，由孔祥熙，俞鴻鈞先後擔任主任員，在此期間，審核標準及核准手續規定甚嚴，故核准外匯數額亦爲數甚少。抗戰勝利後，交通恢復，國際貿易頻繁，宋子文出任行政院長後，乃於卅五年三月四日公布中央銀行管理外匯暫行辦法，及進也口貿易暫行辦法，於中央銀行成立外匯審核處，並指定廣東銀行等廿九家銀行爲指定銀行，經營外匯業務，對於政府機關申請外匯案件，由行政院或財政院核准，通知中央銀行照售，所有進口僑匯及個人申請，均有指定銀行辦理，每週外匯收支數日及個人申請，均由指定銀行辦理後，將其遐以數目連同申請書，報呈中央銀行牙匯審核處，多餘外匯售與中央銀行，不敷之數則隨時由中央銀行以官價供給。當時國際交通恢復，限制進口貨品種類甚少，中央銀行對於外匯進出差額旣儘量供應，所有商民外匯核結權限，事實上修操之於各指定銀行之手，中央銀行外匯審核處不過事後審核各該銀行之週報而已，是爲外匯使用最自由之時期，亦即用費外匯最多時期（詳附件一·二·）。嗣以外貨輸入過多，中央銀行所有外匯繼續無限制供應市面，亦有匱乏之處，且官價外匯與黑市外匯之差價日鉅（詳附件三），國家所受損失日大，中央乃於卅五年十一月十七日公佈修正進也咪貿易暫行辦法，設立輸入臨時管理委員會，採用輸入許可制，並實施外匯事前申請審核辦法，進口貿易，遂受一定限制，（詳附件四）。至本年二月，以黃金風潮發生，外匯黑市更形猖獗，乃由政府公布經濟緊急措施方案，對於外匯，採用更嚴厲之管制，輸入貨品更加嚴格，對黑市外匯，復予取締，於是外匯管理由極度放任進入極度控制之情况，其外匯支出，已較卅五年三月四日至十一月十七日之外匯使用數額，乃大見緊縮。惟以政府對於外匯價格，限以一二·〇〇〇之固定官價，而黑市蒸蒸日上，以致僑匯及其他外匯收入日少，出日貿易無法經營，政府把握之外匯日少，於是乃更有本年八月十七日公布於固定一二·〇〇〇官價外匯之外，同時視市塲情形而逐日決定外匯市價之辦法，以期澈底消滅外匯黑市，增進外匯收入，更於八月十八日停止一切自備外匯貨品之准許入口，以期作更嚴峻之緊縮，此抗戰以來我政府對於外匯管理之經過槪况也。</p>
<p>（乙）外匯使用情形</p>
<p>在上述各時期中之外匯使用手續，及外匯使用情形：（一）計自卅四年八月十九日至卅五年三月三日，爲央行外匯審核委會時期，其審核之標凖法規，有個人申請購買外匯辦法，保險事業申請外購買外匯辦法，保險事業申請外匯辦法，政府機關及事業機關請購外匯辦法，及戰時工商業購外匯辦法，其時限制甚嚴，交通亦極困難，除主席特准及財政部先予核准補行提會之案件外，個人申請外匯限於留學生申請出國旅學費，患病在國內無法醫治者之出國治療費，國內無法購得之自用藥品購置費，政府出國人員之旅費，生活費，及人壽保險費等，工商業僅限於保險，影片公司，及戰明生產局核准之器材原料，且實際申請者不多，大部份均屬政府機關申請案件，計在此期中共售出美金八·九九七·〇八二·〇二元，英金二·〇一〇·三七四鎊，印幣二三·三九五·一〇〇盧比·共折合美金六四·二〇〇·八四五·九五元，其中機關申請佔百分之八十七，個人申請僅佔百分之二，工商業申請佔百分之十一，足見當時對於政府機關之使用外匯，並未嚴格限制，而受極度管制者，僅爲一般工商業及個人而已（詳本年三月審計部呈院報告）。在此期中，全部二千件外匯申請案件，經審計部於本年三月奉院令派員核閱結果，經發現個人申請案件不符規定，破例核准者，有八案，原案爲私人申請，而列入政府機關申請案件且不合規定有二案，共計僅美金三萬三千餘元，印幣一萬另六百盧比（詳審計部呈本院報告）。</p>
<p>（二）自卅五年三月四日至十一月十六日，爲央行外匯審核處時期，其審核之標準法規，有央行管理外匯暫行辦法及進出口貿易暫行辦法，政府機關申請外匯，其初一部份由財政部核准，嗣後統歸政院核准，指定銀行經營之外匯業務，除出口貨物僑匯個人申請等外，以進口貿易爲大宗，且英行對於外匯申請，儘量供給，而當時黑市匯價與官價相差尚徵，若干貨品不易申請外匯者，廠商每自備外匯購辦進口，故進口數值實遠較各指定銀行核准者爲多。九月以後，中央銀行對進口貨品逐漸加緊限制，結果，外匯黑市高於官價百分之五十，而申請核准進口之貨品數值反日形增加，於是逐有十一月十七日事先審核之嚴格限制。在此期中，據審計部於本年三月派員審核結果，除發現各指定銀行遇有特別情形之申請案件，未經英行之核准而遽行售與外匯者，及未領輸入許可證而擅售與外匯者，經央行外匯審核處函知糾正，尚未全部遵照辦理外，關於政府機關申請外匯案偵探，以當時政院主管外匯審核工作旣無一定審核機構，又無詳細法規，核准時或由政院行文，或由宋前院長個人決定，以使條手論英行撥售外匯，其未經正式程序，顯有未合之處甚多，茲舉要例數則如下：一·卅五年四月五日，央行業務局外匯日記帳，列有宋前　長交下手條云：「政府撥給郭世五家屬美金十萬元，以酬獎郭世五有家屬捐獻所藏磁器，已由院會通過，茲請即由央行開美金一萬元紐約中國銀行支付之支票十張，即將郭昭俊君領取」等語（原條存央行）。查郭氏家屬是否在美獻捐磁器？究作何用？歸何處保存？經詢政院，均無案可稽，而費此鉅量外匯，并非軍政急需，又未照正常手續辦理，實屬難解。二，卅五年四月十一日，宋前院長致貝祖貽英文條論稱：「宋子　代政府向加拿大政府購買四七〇〇噸之船隻三艘，價款加幣，五七五，〇〇〇，〇〇元，已電席德懋（紐約中國銀行）先付宋子良加幣一五七，五〇〇，〇〇元，並於準備啓運時　付全部，囑付還席德懋。」（原英文條論及譯文存央行）。央行當即與席德懋接洽結果，於四月廿三日函財政國庫署，請准撥歸墊，並呈報政院，但卷內未准國庫署歸墊及政院關於購船全案之正式文卷，計三船共付加幣一，五八〇，〇二八，七八元，先墊加幣三一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇元折合國幣五六九，二七二，七二三，六〇元，於卅五年四月廿三晶請國庫署撥還歸墊，七月十五日再付加幣一，二七〇，〇二八，七八元，折合國幣二，五六五，四五八，一三五，六〇元，於七月二十日列入財政部欠賬內，三，自三十五年三月四日至三十六年二月十五日租用外輪自秦皇島運送　煤炭至滬，其運費均外匯支付，共費美金八，四五四，二九〇，〇〇元，又英金四九七，四三一鎊，佔此期中個人及非進口外匯總額美金全部幾達二分之一，英金全部超過二分之一。據三十五年八月政院通令，所有中國境內不論貨物買賣或工作報酬之費用，除政府特准者外，一律以法幣計算，不得以外幣支付，前項鉅額外匯之支付，宋前院長於外匯來源困難之際，即使特准，亦嫌浪費。此外，一切商品，如罐頭·果品·玻璃物品等之進口過於自由，故在此期中，外匯消耗最鉅。</p>

<h3>英訪華團日程表</h3>
<p>英訪華團日程表如次：十月六日至十一日南京·十月十一日至十四日（下午）北平，十月十四日至十七日（上午）潘陽，十月十七日（上午）至廿日天津，十月廿日（上午）青島，午餐後起飛赴上海。十月廿日至廿五日上海，十月廿五日至廿八日淡水，十月廿八日至卅日漢口，十月卅日至十一月一日重慶，十一月六日廣州——香港。又該團在京日程：十月六日下午三時半抵京下機，即廣播錄音，五時拜會外交部劉葉二次長，六時拜會行政院張院長及王副院長，六時半舉行記者招待會。十月七日上午九時拜訪孫副主席，繼出席立法院例會旁聽，十時一刻訪沈市長，十一時訪參政會邵秘書長，午間沈市長歡宴，下午謁陵及遊名勝，五時半至七時半英大使酒會，晚孫副主席歡宴。十月八日上午赴交通部，由三部長招待參觀統計表室　及郵電機構，午應俞部長宴，下午參觀五洲公園，首都電廠，自來水廠及工人福利社，五時半至七時半參政會酒會，晚張院長宴，十月九日上午參觀中央大學，金陵大學，金陵女大，午間市參議會陳議長宴，下午參觀中央醫院，兒童福利社，五至七時中英文協酒會，晚八時主席接見並賜宴。十月十日上午參觀全國國貨展覽會，赴國府簽字致賀國慶，下午參觀馬術會及全國美術展覽會，中央農林實騐所，五至七時半外交部酒會，晚英大使宴，十月十一日離京赴平。</p>
<h3>民靑兩黨談話內容</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨發言人崔心一五日發表書面談話時稱，關於政黨提名參加大選事，現以種種困難，尚未獲政協議。民社黨之意，倘將業不由政黨提名，而成爲個人自由競選之局，則本黨有無黨員當選，以有究有幾人當選，均非所計。果取此一方式，本黨即不擬參加聯合政府，而將以純粹在野黨之姿態，對於國是表示其意見。至於少數黨要求參加地方參議會事。外間似有誤解，甚至有人謂爲違反民主原則，實則遴選少數議員參加民意機構，匪特選少數議員參加民意機構，匪特絕無不民主之嫌，且正符合民主之斟酌精神；則以一黨訓政廿年之久，他黨絕無其他機會表達其所代之若干民眾之意見故也。少數黨對於參加地方議會一舉，異常重視，設無所成，旣無由表白其見解，參加政府大可不必。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中國青年黨中央黨部於五日開中常會後，由發言人王師曾就青民黨參加省縣市參議會及對於大選之政黨協商提名的問題，再發表書面談話略云：「此次國務會議決議遴選青民兩黨代表參加地方民意機構，乃根據共同施政方針之規定。國務會議依據共同施政方針之規定而作決議，不能謂爲違法。現在中國尚未進入到眞正民主的階段，所有許多有關促進民主的政令，都是過渡時期因時制宜的辦法，即以各省縣市參議會爲例，到其任期屆滿，應即改選之際，政府亦可以命令延長一年。青民兩黨此次提出參加地方民意機構的近因，即以各省市縣參議會之任期，旣已延長，無從配合大選而參加地方民意機關之競選也。關於遴選代表與民選，是否可以共處的問題，有制憲的國民大會及國民參政會之事實可解答。本黨相信國民黨當能一本其第六屆三中全會通過之憲政實施準備案第六項的原則，眞誠與其他和平合法之政黨互相提挈，以利於憲政之合理的推進」云云。</p>

<p>主席訓詞全文</p>
<p>中國工程師學會第十國屆年會全體會員鑒：貴會此次年會，集全國工程界之碩彥，相聚於首都，研計今後建設之大計，其意義旣極重大，其責任尤爲艱鉅，所望諸君，一本過去，在抗戰期中，英勇奮鬥之精神，得益加發揚光大，體察當前民生之急需，配合各地資源事業之實况，先求有效之整理，兼奠發展之基礎，本末先後，悉切機宜，脚踏實地，步步成功，使農村工業化，日有進展，工業現代化，啓其楔機，庶地克盡其利，人克盡其才，則以我國天賦之厚，必能渡過經濟難關，而使舉國民生，進於康樂之域，甚冀本屆年會，於此獲得特殊之成就，政府必當盡最大之努力，以致其實現，惟加勉之。中正。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕「加緊建設挽救當前社會經濟危機」專題，五日在工程師年會中通過，其中對於當前需要加緊進行之建設，分列四點：（一）以增產物資，增加就業爲主要之目標。（二）在現狀下，工業建設應看重一，直接有關增加農業生產之工程及工業，如農產水利，農具製造，及肥料等。二·民生日用必需品之製造工業。三·配合以上兩項之交通事業，公共工程，動力及燃料工業（三）凡合乎上述條件之生產建設事業，政府對其經費，金融界對其貸款，不宜藉口通貨膨脹，而採取過去之緊縮政策，一·在軍事尚在進行之地區，應全力保守，以經濟據點與軍事據點同等重視。二·收復地區應立即恢復其經濟。三當不受軍事影響之地區，更應盡其力之所能，建設其經濟。今日會中討論時，對經濟據點與軍事據點，仍作愼重之研究，原文係以經濟據點作軍事據點，現改爲「同等重視。」</p>

<h3>我國對希臘問題　蔣廷黻重申立塲　美願考慮比所提折衷案　但以南保阿履行聯大建議為條件</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖四日電〕中國代表蔣廷黻今日在聯大政委會中堅强　護美國，請大會阻止蘇聯衛　國在希臘邊境之暴行。蔣氏直接指責南保阿三國，應負近數月中希臘邊界暴行之責任，並謂此等行動　無正當理由。如謂英會援助希臘政府，希臘之鄰邦即可予反對派以援助，此言爲吾人所不能接受，若予以承認，必將引起國際無政府狀態。蘇聯及其巴爾幹衛星國曾反對安理會之干涉，實則凡自命坦白之國家，不應反對國際調査與觀察。安理會如欲執行任務，必須有椒派遣觀察員至和平遭受威脅之世界任何地點。安理會若無此權，必致變質而僅成爲一辭論會，和平之全部機構即將崩潰。中國在希臘並無直接利益，但因此一問題於和平前途非常重要，故擁護美國決議案，請南保阿三國停止及勿再援助希臘游擊隊。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖四日電〕如蘇聯支持下之南保阿三國接受聯合國委員會所建議之大規模國境巡邏，美國對於巴爾幹糾紛解決所提出之嚴峻建議，將加以放寬。美國此項條件，由美代表詹森今日在聯大政委會提出。據詹森稱，如三巴爾幹國家同意此事，則美國願接受比總理史巴克三日所提出之妥協建議，根據此一妥協建議，美國將在聯大不再直接譴責南保阿三國對希內戰之責任。史巴克之建議，將使美國能貫澈其以前在安理會所提之建議，肌成立一半永久性之聯合國邊境監察，以便監視希臘北境地帶。希臘間題辯論定週一繼續舉行。</p>
<h3>國際新聞自由會議　我反對外蒙參加　蘇代表指摘羅福夫人言論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖四日電〕中國代表張彭春今日在聯合國社會委員會中，反對蘇聯　請外蒙參加聯合國新聞自由會議且可投票之主張。張氏稱，此項邀請曾屢次被經社理會所否決，「外蒙絕非係」愛好和平之國家，而可立於其他聯合國家之林」，外蒙顯然無資格參加新聞自由會議。</p>
<p>蘇聯爲外蒙緩頰時，曾稱外蒙與蘇聯合作有素。張氏稱，「本人對蘇聯如此明白證實外蒙紅軍合作一事，表示欣悅。本人對蘇聯明白宣稱外蒙在建設新軍隊一節，更感欣悅。此項新軍隊數週來，已對鄰國顯示其威力，是否此即外蒙愛好和平之謂？」蘇代表佐靈控訴羅斯福夫人以浮而不實及跡近反動之言論，反對蘇聯主張聯合國處罰美國「戰爭阪子」之建議。佐靈演說長達一小時，力稱羅斯福夫人之觀點，與事實不符。「羅斯福夫人何故反對議程上反對法西斯主張，以維護新聞自由之每一字句？何故吾人不坦率公開提出對抗各種法西斯主義之眞正目標」。佐氏重行譴責美國報紙受壟斷性企業操縱，「對社會性事項不屑一顧。中英法附和美國反對蘇聯之建議，印代表班湼冠則同意「報紙之弊端應予阻止」，惟警告稱，完成此目標應以不妨害新聞自由之基本權利爲前提。</p>
<h3>羅夫人播講新聞自由意義</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約四日電〕菲列賓羅慕洛准將及羅斯福夫人，將於五日中午播講新聞自由之意義。羅斯福夫人將先行廣播，然後將向羅慕洛詢問有關新聞自由及聯合國大會中蘇聯所提販賣戰爭諸間題。按羅氏已提出動議，要求聯大於明年在日內瓦召開新聞自由會議。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日電〕羅斯福夫人今日於其每日專　中指稱，蘇聯係使用希特勒之宣傳伎倆。並稱，蘇聯之宣傳技術，爲一—說謊之技術」此篇論文之刋出，適與其在聯大會中與蘇聯辯論新聞自由之意義之時間相同。</p>
<h3>令人感失望</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約五日電〕聯合國第二屆大會開會以來已三星期，各代表對於議程所列各主要事項進展之遲緩，以及大會之可能超過原定六星期之期限，均多感覺失望。若干官員甚至預料俟四强外長會議於十一月底在倫教召開時，聯大可能尙未結束。本屆聯大自開幕以來，舉行之全體大會已達十六次，各委員會及小組會之會議已逾七十次，然除程序事項外，各委會均尙未通過一則決議案，而全體大會對於選舉安理會及託管理事會理事之工作，竟亦禾曾完成。究其原因，尙不外下列諸端：　代表仍圖作宣傳性之演說。　安理會及其他機構理事及委員之選舉旣尙未完成，故各代表均欲利用辯論，以引起對本國之注意。　集團投票制度爲安理會及託管理事會理事難產之原因。　小國對於基本問題，尙不敢貿然採取親美或親蘇之立塲，此蓋由於大會開會之初，美蘇兩強互柑抨擊過甚之故。</p>
<h3>蘇代表主張擴大　遠經會會員範圍</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖四日電〕蘇聯在聯大經濟委員會中提出決議案，要求擴大亞洲及遠東經委會之會員資格。其所提決議案有云，該委會原定之會員資格，應增加包括遠東及亞洲區之一切其他聯合國會員國區內非自治土地，亦應被邀以諮詢身份參加工作。</p>
<h3>伊政府獲信任票</h3>
<p>〔合衆社德黑蘭五日電〕伊朗總理蘇丹納五日在議會秘密會議中，允許解釋蘇伊石油談判之全部過　後，始獲得議會延遲一多時之信任票。反對黨攻擊蘇丹納過去十九個月中之行動，均未得　會授權，應屬非法。投信任票時，九十三票擁護政府，十二票反對，十一票棄權。國票空白，最後結果揭曉時，蘇氏徒衆高呼「好預兆」不巳。</p>
<h3>蘇技術師八名　在美失踪不確</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕前誤傳來密歇根硏究美國生產方式之蘇聯技術師八人失踪事不確。移民局委員密勒稱，此事純爲「誤傳」，移民局確知該八名技術師現在何處。</p>
<h3>義境美軍開始撤退</h3>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬四日電〕美國地中海區司令部今日宣布：美國佔領軍定下週一開始退出義大利，除少數淸理部隊外，其最後一批將在十二月二日出發。按義和約已於九月十五日批准，佔領軍應在九十日內退出義境。</p>
<h3>左翼不信任動議遭否決　義政府地位穩固　外長宣布美允放棄義賠艦</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬四日電〕左翼社會黨領袖納尼提出不信任加斯貝利總理領導下之無共黨政府案業被義制憲會議以二七一對一七九票打消，共黨領袖托格里亞蒂迅即將其不信任動議撤回。六月間制憲會議以四十三票之差通過信任加斯貝利案，四日之差額九十三票，超過一倍有餘。納尼旣失敗，托格里亞蒂又撤回動議，故極左派參加政府之企圖已吿失敗。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬四日電〕外長史福柴今日向制憲議會宣布，美國已允放棄其名下應分得之義艦隊，全塲一致歡呼，甚至共黨議員亦不得不附和。史氏繼稱，義代表團不久將赴蘇聯，進行貿易談判</p>
<h3>英內閣改組　日內即將宣布</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕艾德禮首相週末將完成內閣改組之最後計劃，新陣容於下週一或二即可宣布。迄至目前爲止，關於被更動之人，仍嚴守秘密中。在各種猜測中，比較最有價値者當如下述：國防大臣亞歷山大爲最可能退出內閣之人，渠之參加內閣大部份係由於渠之在經濟合作運動中之政治領導地位，渠年已六十二，就年事方面言，已宜參加上議院。共和邦關係部大臣艾迪生勳爵年已七十八歲，且已嘗一再表示願意退休，故在此次改組中，其出　內閣已爲必然。燃料大臣辛威爾由於去冬之燃料危機以及渠之得罪支特政府之中等階級，極可能退出內閣，然一說辛威爾將繼艾迪生接掌共和邦關係部供應大臣維爾莫特，傳維氏即係促使內閣決定延期實行鋼鐵國營之人，故為工黨左翼份子所不喜，亦有相當被拙之可能。果爾，則可　職位，最可能由內閣急進派領袖現任衛生大臣倍文接替，然以倍文決心使政府之住宅建築計劃獲得成功，故渠或不擬放棄衛生部大臣之職。糧食大臣史特萊契處理最難討好之事務，居然獲有相等成功，故可能晋昇爲屬於機要內閣之國防大臣。</p>
<h3>菲代表向聯大建議　發動新馬歇爾計劃　歐亞兩洲不應有所偏廢</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖四日電〕菲律實代表葛台諾在聯大經洛委員會中建議發動又一「馬歇爾援助計劃」，以調查未盡發展之區域若亞洲等。渠對馬歇爾計劃之報吿，祇涉及歐洲而不涉及後進區域，表示遺憾。蓋若有全世界需要美元數額之報吿，即可明瞭世界之需要，而有系統地計劃分配全球之資源。葛氏支持印度代表之言，認爲對於未盡發展之區域，應多加注意。</p>
<h3>英將在東非　建供應基地</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕英陸軍本月內即將在非洲建立近年來規　最大之供應基地其主要基地設在東非根雅之　巴　港，適在赤道之下，位於開　與開普鎭間之半途，建築費將達千百萬　，需時當許多年之久。此一基地將爲英陸軍在海外之主要基地，現存埃及印度之英軍物資，以及英軍撤出巴勒斯坦後在　地之英軍用物質，均將移　此一所基地。</p>
<h3>英公主結婚蛋糕　糕分四層矞皇富麗　圖案複雜寓意深長</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕全國製餅公會公報稱：伊麗莎伯公主結婚蛋糕之式樣，已經公主問意。糕分四層，第一層爲新夫婦之徽章，溫莎別　，波爾莫洛爾別　及白金漢宮圖樣；第二層為公主　溫莎自由巿民銜時所獲之手　箱，公主以衛隊長身份閱兵，馬泰本角戰役，各種音樂符號及各種體育運動之圖案；第三層為一愛神手持上書新夫婦名字縮寫之盾牌，　家海軍徽章，輔佐隊及婦女隊之徽章及蒙特巴頓上尉所畫服役以參加馬泰本角戰役之主力艦勇敢號等圖案；第四層將為自治領之國徽，即澳洲，加拿大，南非，紐西蘭，印度及巴基斯坦。</p>
<p>〔聯合社雪梨四日電〕澳洲鄕婦協會致送伊　莎伯公主與蒙巴頓中尉之結婚蛋糕，今日由尋梨寬運倫敦。經糕計分六層，重一百三十磅，底層　以澳洲徽章，每層代表一邦。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾建議　向印埃等國索款　保守黨年會宣吿閉幕</h3>
<p>〔合衆社勃萊登四日電〕保守黨年會四日晚在此間閉幕，邱吉爾在五千代表歡迎聲中，要求英國向印度，埃及及若干其他盟國紫取英國助其防禦德日義侵略之費用。英國在戰時扶助他國，致負債累累，國外投資之半數亦吿變賣，故今日英國之經濟危機，泰半種因於此。英國援助埃及，印度及若干盟國抵抗軸心國而負擔債款，致年須支付數百萬磅，「故余以為吾人應提出扶助彼等之反要求，蓋事實上負債者爲彼等，而非吾人」。</p>
<h3>華萊士定期　赴聖地考察　不在國外作公開演講</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約四日電〕前美國副總統華萊士在此稱，渠定十月十七日偕渠所主編之「新共和雜誌」發行人史屈萊特等，搭飛機前往已勒斯坦，與阿拉伯及猶太族懇談，並調査聖地之農業資源。渠不擬在國外公開演說，但將以此行所得，在其主編之雜誌中絡續發表。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾被包圍　愛犬死於非命</h3>
<p>〔聯合社英國勃萊登四日電〕此間歡迎羣衆星期六終日追隨及包圍邱吉爾，邱氏之法國鬈毛種愛犬，在勃立登海濱離開邱氏隨從，竟被公共汽車碾斃。</p>
<h3>法經濟危機日亟　擬支用全部可動用美元</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓四日電〕法官方人士透露：彼等已在討論利用美進出口銀行及世界銀行對法貸款之所餘部份，以購買必需的美國聯入品之可能性。</p>
<p>世界銀行對法貸款二億五千萬美元中，尙餘四千萬元，而進出口銀行貸款亦尙餘約一億八千萬元。此等款項均已指定作購買專供間設用物資之用，法官員對於世界銀行之是否允許將款移作「救急」之用，尙表懷疑，惟進出口銀行貸款中至多六十萬元，可望移作支付自美採購之　物及煤斤之刖。法國「救急」用之其他款項，尙有：　布魯塞爾三國委員會分配法國之德國所刧黃金價値約九千三百萬元，　美國所付各種戰時補償費共約五千萬元；　再向國際貨幣基金會購置美元。過去法國會向基金會以其所存基金易得美元二千五百萬元。法官方預料美國國會在十二月底以前不致通過任何救援款項，而法國每月最低限度需要一億二千萬美元，故法國至少尙需二億美元，以支付急需之煤斤及穀物。</p>
<h3>韓右翼靑年團體大示威　要求美軍繼續留駐朝鮮　示威羣衆提出激烈反蘇口號</h3>
<p>〔合衆社漢城五日電〕韓國右派大韓靑年協會會員約六萬　人，五日在漢城運動塲集會，反對美軍自韓撤退之可能性，大韓靑年協會由各極右派靑年團體合組而成，最大之單位爲沙埠協　，原係北韓流亡靑年之團體。示威靑年行伍整齊，自漢城各區魚貫進入運動塲，美憲兵亦全體出動，且奉令必要時在散會時全力援助朝鮮警察。示威者高舉旗幟，如「打倒行戰，造成混亂局面。互鬥中至少有卅人被捕，受傷人數尙不明。五日之示威原亦定四日舉行，後以天雨順延一日。美憲兵則嚴密圍守希鐵柯夫之官邸，以防類似四日之不測。</p>
<h3>我駐漢城總領事　昨啟程飛美</h3>
<p>〔聯合社漢城四日電〕中國駐朝鮮總領事劉馭萬，定五日乘西北航空公司飛機赴成功湖，向出席聯大會中國代表團供給資料，準備討論朝鮮問題。</p>
<h3>吧城中華總會大聲疾呼　印尼僑胞遭虐待　備忘錄一件呈安理會及領事團</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞四日電〕此間中華總會在其主要遞呈於安全理事會及本地領事團之備忘錄中，對印尼共和國領袖為印尼虐待華僑所通常舉出之「內在原因」不予重視。此文件之文字及照片，說明均一致强調印尼華僑並未存有任何政治或領土野心。</p>
<p>該備忘錄稱：雖則有數百華僑能積聚資財，然如謂華僑爲一般「富有集團」，則爲無稽之談。此種謬論，如以賦稅統計數字加以駁斥，當可推翻。若干印尼共和國領袖毫不知辨別，而竟認少數華僑之錯誤爲代表華僑全體者，並認爲居住於盟國領土上之華僑「非爲中立」。該備忘錄並批評戰前之荷蘭經濟制度，蓋當時荷蘭當局曾降低工資至最低限度，俾使輸出之產品，得在世界市塲中竸爭，且仍能為資本家及行政當局獲得利潤。此種制度之存在，外加印尼人民本身之缺乏精力及自動力，遂致使印尼人民經濟落後。該備忘錄指稱：「如將印尼窘困歸咎於華僑之剝削，似屬不公。」事實上在經濟各種阻礙下，如有無權擁有土地等規定。華僑主要因勤勞節儉及智慧，遂能維持生計。該備忘錄繼稱，在日軍佔領時期，印尼人曾獲得與華僑在經濟方面競爭之充份機會，並甚至可能奪佔華僑之經濟地位。彼等雖會有日本方面之援助，然終致失敗。該備忘錄末稱，華僑方面實不明瞭印尼共和國於七月廿一日「警察行動」開始前後，以對付敵人之手段，而對華僑所加之虐待之意義何在。同時印尼共和國實不能謂對此虐待情　，絕無所聞。</p>
<h3>歐洲共產黨員成立反美組織</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦五日廣播：據息，蘇，南，保，羅，匈，波，法，義，捷等九個歐洲國家之共產黨員，本月初在波蘭開會，當即通過決議案一項，主張對美國「帝國主義」，決不妥協，並決定在南斯拉夫京城成立一機關，負責指導。</p>
<h3>日修改刑法　不敬罪通姦罪廢止</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京五日電〕日衆院司法委員會自開會以來，經三個月長時間之審議，已將刑法修改竣事，現已決定删除舊刑法中之「不敬罪」及「通姦罪」。所謂不敬罪，係依據舊憲法中日本天皇有神聖不可侵犯之權利而規定者，新憲法已將此項删除，故刑法之規定已無根據。</p>
<h3>希魔未死　獲更確鑿證據</h3>
<p>〔路透社華沙四日電〕盟國當局移交波蘭之戰犯嫌疑犯前德空軍駕駛員蒲姆迦特上尉今日稱，渠於一九四五年四月廿六日即外傳希特勒自殺後之數日，曾駕駛飛機載希特勒及其情婦伊娃勃勞恩前往丹麥。</p>

<h3>萬里長征·　·忽傳失踪　兩環球小型機北來　途遇暴風迫降厦門</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕週遊世界之兩單翼小型訓練機，此次飛來遠東，因運日氣候不侍，滯留香港已有三日之久，昨晨七時二十分，始起飛來滬。但起飛一小時後，即與地面失去喧囂絡，一時本巿航空界盛傳兩機業已失踪。原定抵滬時間約在下午三時左右，屆詩本市龍華，江灣，虹橋三機場，均一無消息。雖經民航局上海辦事處迭　　海各地電台查詢，結果依然不知下落。當時各地氣象報吿，均謂沿海氣候惡劣，且風速在下午最高會達每小時二十八哩，迄至傍晚更高至每小時六十哩。故當時爲預防萬一計，民航局即電知美軍方面，派出海面搜索隊，在沿海一帶四出偵査，冀有所獲。</p>
<p>迄至夜九時半，正當各地電台互相査詢，意爲兇多吉少之際，忽然民航局接獲厦門方面來電，謂兩機業已降落厦門，人機均安。至此，失踪之謎，始吿打破，但各地電台之工作人員已爲此而忙碌終日矣。</p>
<p>按此次週遊世界之兩單翼訓練機，各有駕駛員一人駕駛，一爲特魯門，一爲伊文斯。機上僅有之一空座，須携帶多量之汽油，準備作長途飛行，故並無助手同行。昨晨在香港起飛時，兩機曾各裝載足够飛行十八小時之汽油，當飛至福州境內，卒因不堪高速度逆風所　擊，始就近被迫降落於　門機塲。</p>
<p>至該機今日是否續飛上海，仍須視天氣之好壤而定。其「飛行計劃」今旅可能與上海方面取得蓮絡，如天氣轉佳，則今日到滬時間，約在下午二時二十分左右。</p>
<p>昨日該機在半途失去蓮絡之主要原因，事後偵悉，機上所裝設之無錢電，係一小型僅重二十六磅之無綫常機，爲美國Bendix廠出品，其通報範圍在良好之環境下可達八十哩，如遇天氣不佳，則僅能及五十哩。故昨日該機飛出一小時後，各電台即無從與之取得連絡也</p>

<h3>從工業用煤需要上　看出日本復興可怕　侯德榜為永利交涉收回設備歸來談</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕有世界聲譽的我國化學家侯德榜氏，最近由日本回到平津，前犬到了上海。他兩週以後要到印度去設計燒堿廠，然後赴美爲湘廠訂購新機器。記者昨大拜訪他，談起在日本的見聞，他感慨頗多。</p>
<p>他這次去日本，是爲永利公司交涉收回戰時被日人拆去的硝酸製道設備。日本人取得這批設備後，運回本國的工廠使用，損毀的不少，增添的亦多。屢次和盟軍總部交涉無成，　結所在是盟總堅　戰時損失須在賠償項內淸算，而日人增添的設備不能收回。永利公司不答允，認爲賠償問題的全盤解決，眞是遙遙無期，他們不能「守株待兎」。侯氏這次在日本的努力，使盟總讓了步，允許永利公司是例外，同意他們收回日人增添的都份。但是這條歸還的原則，盟總仍不允變更。這套價值五十萬美金的設備，現在正在裝包中，三個月後可運回祖國。</p>
<p>日工業恢復迅速</p>
<p>侯氏順便參觀了日本的工業，復元的迅速使他驚奇。大部份的工業巳經恢復了戰前三分之一甚至二分之一的生產，化學肥料工業走得最快，不久司和戰前相等。盟　超越戰前水準。一般而言，除了重工業之外，工業恢復得很快。我們可以工業用煤為尺度，看出日本復興的可怕。他們現在月產煤二百萬噸，全　的自標是三千萬噸，但由於工業恢復之迅速，煤斤不够需要。日本人是全國在苦幹，而且是有組識有政策的幹，他們的官民是上下配合，作風一致的。</p>
<p>美對賠償主寬大</p>
<p>我提醒他在天津對新聞記者的談話裏，把賠償問題看得很悲觀。他笑着否認：「這是事實」。他認爲先期拆遷是有把握的，但是分配時間要延長到一年半。我國可分到的是一萬八千件的零碎機器，而不是整套的工廠設備，賠償機器的品質尙好，他希望政府能配給民廠。至於總賠償，他認爲靠不住，因爲以美國的觀點，支配一切。美國斯瑞克視察　，背景是美國的商業利益，他們希望日本早日恢復，和美國大親模的通商，所以在賠償問題上，力主寬大，如何管制日本使永不為遠東的侵略勢力一節，却沒有想到。</p>
<p>最好本身能自給</p>
<p>日本未來的工業水　，遠東委員會提出了一九三一到一九三四的標準，但尙未通過。侯氏說：「我主張以一九三〇爲標準，那是日本發動侵華的前一年，同時這一年日本是不景氣。一九三四年日本的生產因軍事需要，已提得很高了」。</p>
<p>這位工業家對抵制日貨持一種特別的見解。他說：「將來日貨和美貨會分不淸楚，美國以原棉供給日本，而」收其成品紗布，用美貨的名義，推銷各國。所以硬性的抵制日貨，根本是不可能的。站在中國的立場上，最好本身生產能自給，否則打經濟算盤，揀便宜合算的買，不管印度或日本，都是中國的勁敵，因為印度紗布的查量，目前是亞洲第一啊！」</p>
<h3>圖絕情婦謊稱被綁　保險商怪函　自謂願撕票</h3>

<h3>丁文淵博士應邀播講　靑年應走之路　必須遵守法紀為民表率　始能享受民主自由幸福</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報昨假座上海電台，舉行第廿七次星期日特別廣播，請國立同濟大學校長丁文淵博士播講一靑年應走之路」。茲紀錄其演講大意如左「中國經八年抗戰之後，一切建設經過極度的破壞，勝利以後國內又遭逢變亂，以致復員的工作，受到嚴重的阻撓。靑年學生生活於此動盪不安的大時代，自不免有徬徨苦悶，無所適從的痛苦。因此「靑年之路」這一問題，雖係老生常談，於此時此地提出，亦司謂切全需要。</p>
<p>圖為丁文淵博士播音時姿態（本報攝）</p>
<p>中國今日正進入民主時代，憲政時代。靑年學生每爲共產黨宜傳所迷惑，以爲共黨爲一民主的政黨。共黨亦以「新民主主義」爲號召，事實有大　不然者，共黨乃一極端專制獨裁的政黨。在共　盤踞之區械，決無自由民主之可言。故吾人對於政府之總動員運動，　亂剿匪建國政策，認爲極其正確，應善導靑年擁護此一政策，傳能實現民主，實旅憲政。</p>
<p>靑年　學生欲事受民主自由，其重要前提爲必須具有守法精神。中國與歐美各國相比，一切均感落後。惟法律方面，則較歐美各國毫無遜色，中國已有完備之法典，果全國民衆人人能守法重紀，則中國社會必上軌道。惜國人智識程度大都不合水準，以致雖有完備之法律，而犯法者仍比比皆是。靑年學生於此須能爲一般民衆之表率，以守法的精神影響一般民衆，造成良好風氣，將來出了學校之後，纔能領導民衆改造社曾。</p>
<p>遵守　法紀的基本原則，爲培養道德觀念，養成良好習慣，重禮貌，守秩序，使守法重紀不至成爲空洞的口號，必須使每一靑年能躬行實踐。近來靑年學生風氣囂張，蕩法踰矩，以致研究學術空氣日趨淡薄，此實爲現代中國之敎育危機。鄙人服務敎育界時閒稍久，對此現象，心所謂危，不敢不大聲疾呼，促起敎育界人士與靑年學生之覺悟。此時挽救敎育危機的方法，惟有靑年學生認淸道路，能守法者始能享受民主自由的幸福，當此社會秩序紊亂之時，靑年須能以守法重紀的舉動，以作民衆的模範，進而培養淳　的學風，加強硏究學術的工作，在學校中為好學生，到社會上纔能成爲好公民。當此中國進人民主憲政的新時代，希望靑年能走上守法的大道，共同　　設新中國而努力。」</p>

<h3>東北的動力　三大發電策源地　鏡泊湖孤懸絕塞　小豐滿密佈硝烟　水豐陷微妙狀態</h3>
<p>〔本報　陽二日航訊〕長江三峽水力工程停頓了，黃河水力工程，更不知何年何月有實現的希望？在這　置天予力量而無力利用的當兒，大家對於東北水力發電事。業，又加重了懷念。</p>
<p>東北的水利，在航運和灌溉上，尙待逐步發展，在水力利用上，「水豐」「小豐滿」「鏡泊湖」的水力發電事業，巳經有了很好的規模，並已聞名國內外了。</p>
<p>這三個水力策源地，在國際上聞名，也在國際上　着酸，甜，苦，辣的滋味，鏡泊湖孤懸塞北，水體在中·韓·蘇三國微妙關係上打轉，小　滿又在硝烟中，不能放出全部力量來。</p>
<p>東北的眼睛，東北的光明，東北的動力，全國人的關切，都在這東北三個水力發電策源地上。</p>
<p>吉林，小豐滿，是這三個水電策源地中唯一在收復區域裏的一個，它原來是一個半樵半晨的小村落。</p>
<p>地當第二松花江上游，離開永吉二十四公里，這就是東北域內第二松花江最大水力發電所之所在了。第二松花江發源在中韓分界綫上的長白山，流經深淵狹谷，崇山峻嶺，蜿蜓曲折，到了豐滿，豁然開朗，形成一大深淵，然後向北流入平原，豐滿正在江流變換地點上。</p>
<p>右岸呌做猴嶺，沿江西行，標高九百米，屹立江面部份，高達七百米，左岸是摩天嶺支脈的喇姑塔　、高七百七十米，迫近江流，和猴嶺隔岸對峙，形成天然關門。</p>
<p>關門的江面上，建造混凝土重力式堤壩，橫斷江流，造成世界第四位人造大湖。今天，聞名的小豐滿發電所，就是利用這個</p>
<p>人造湖水</p>
<p>的落差和水量，發出豐富而低廉的電力。</p>
<p>小豐滿水力堤壯觀（東北社攝）</p>
<p>原計劃裝設八台電機，設備容最計爲五十六萬瓩，量大出力爲四八〇·〇〇〇，可達二十六億KWH，用這項龐大的電力，開發東北各地的實業，並供照明。</p>
<p>當時電力的分配計劃，大約以一二〇·〇〇〇輸往吉林地區，用以掘發電石礦。（年產約三十萬噸），開採木材，以及製紙工業，人造石油，煤礦等所需電力的供應。</p>
<p>以二四〇·〇〇〇瓩輸往撫順方面，供應撫順，西安，遼寗等地採煤動力，以及東邊道和長白山附近煤，鐵的探發，鉛·鎂等輕金屬的製造，鞍山冶金，煉鋼等重工業所需動力。</p>
<p>另以一二〇·〇〇〇瓩輸往長春哈爾濱兩處，供應中小型工業用電，以及一般照明用電，其計劃二回綫的一回綫路，輸電容量也僅爲原計劃的半數。</p>
<p>八月二十日，蘇軍進駐，九月二十日起，鳩工拆卸，於是原有八台水車發電機中僅僅剩下了二台。</p>
<p>現存設備</p>
<p>僅有二台機器，勉強運輸，每台最大容量以七〇·〇〇〇KVA計，合計不過一四〇·〇〇〇KVA、前發電最高時已達一三四·〇〇〇瓩、復興豐滿，實爲解決東北電力，以及促成東北工礦復工的先決條件，也是當前東北經建的主要關鍵。</p>
<p>小豐滿經梅河口輸潘錢路，今年夏天，大部份落在了匪軍手裘，這條高壓綫路，可以輸電七八萬基瓦，被切斷了以後，遼　發生了很大的電荒問題，電力局爲了解決遼潘用電嚴重問題，經過七拼入凑，在撫順等火力發電上多方努力，獲得電力十二萬基瓦，遼　工礦業和照明用電，纔得大部份的解決，現在又從長春沿着中長路輸來小豐滿四千多的電力，情形又可好些。</p>
<p>遼南工礦用電，自從北票電廠出了毛病，完全靠着錦西石油公司發出八千至一萬一千的電力來維持，過去日人是以水力發電爲主的、火力發電是站在輔助地位，現在，眞是無從說起了。</p>
<p>鏡泊湖水力發電所的建設，是偽滿產業開發五年計劃之一，預計牡丹江水系，如能</p>
<p>全部運用</p>
<p>可行三十萬的電力。鏡泊湖發　所，是運用牡丹江水力的第一步建設。</p>
<p>民國二十八年三月動工修建，經三年的時間、三十一年大月二十五日，開始發電，爲東北水力從兩江合流點，上溯約三六〇公里，在　安縣屬東京城阿堡村，四季都利用鏡泊湖的貯水和隧道、得落差五十七米，湖水面積約等於小豐滿人造湖六分之一。大湖面結冰時，標高三五〇米，夏季增水時，僅漲二米左右，湖長約四萬二千米，寬由五千至四萬三千米不等，周圍計十八萬米　，湖的最深部份，達五〇米，著名的東京城吊水樓大瀑布，高一三米，瀑坑成馬蹄形，水深約三十米，鏡泊湖在地質時代，由西方山地所噴出的溶岩，將收丹江閉塞，成爲火山性天然建設的堤壩。</p>
<p>當地氣溫，最高達攝氏三十三度，最低零下四十度，寒暖相差七十三度、冬期四個月，湖水上面結冰厚達三尺餘，夏季七·八·九三個月間降水量，爲全年百分之七十。</p>
<p>發電工程</p>
<p>在鏡泊湖北端，水面下十八米處，設取水口，挖掘長達三，〇〇三米的圓形隧這一條，直徑五，四米，北導至牡丹江本流接近地點，蓮接調壓水槽，從此分接水壓鐵管兩條，長約二二〇米，直徑平均二·三米，導入水車。</p>
<p>使用過的水，仍舊放流牡丹江裏，發電所內，水成傘狀，幻奇，壯麗，引人入勝。勝利後，發電所被匪軍控制，因爲遠在寒北，一切都在「情况不明」狀態中。</p>
<p>鴨綠江水　發電所，在朝鮮平安北道朔州郡九曲面「水豐洞」，從水豐洞到安東省寬甸縣碑碣子，建造重力式混凝土堤壩，橫斷鴨綠江本流，是高一〇，四米，滿水位標高一二二，五米，路及寬甸，桓仁，　安等縣，以及朝鮮的朔州，　城，碧　，　山，渭原等郡。</p>
<p>鴨綠江是中韓的界河，經僞滿和朝鮮方面，在民國二十六年四月交換共同經營鴨絲江水力發電合同，由滿鮮雙方各投資五千萬元，組織「朝鮮鴨綠江水力發電株式會社」，及「滿洲鴨綠江水力發電株式會社」，開發後所發電力，滿鮮各佔二分之一，平均分配。</p>
<p>水力發電全部計劃，是從鴨綠江本流，朝鮮新義州的上流，十七公里處做起點，到達新義州上流四百八十公里處爲止，在這中間，共築</p>
<p>水閘七處</p>
<p>全　　面積四五·五三五平方公里，總貯水量為二〇四億立方公尺。</p>
<p>水豐水力發電工程，民國二十六年秋，興工修築，民國三十年八月完成一部份，開始發電，民國三十二年秋，全部完成，這是東亞最大的水力發電工程。</p>
<p>鴨綠江水豐發電所，所發電力，應以二分之一輸送東北境內，當時「滿電」修建二二〇K超高壓輸電錢二條，一個從水豐到鞍山，一個從水豐經安東到大連。</p>
<p>水豐電源，中鮮兩國合用，本應沒有問題，但事實不然，電廠在江對岸朝鮮土地上，堤壩在我岸上，　北光復後，安東區械尙有電，收復鞍山鋼鐵冶煉城後，水豐直達鞍山綫路，遭到了殘酷破壞，安東收復之後，安東電力反需人民以糧米換來，安東非產米區，於是大家遭遇到了相當的困難。</p>
<p>安東我軍事當局，去冬派員過江會晤北鮮蘇軍當局，交涉結果，是我方</p>
<p>護堤有責</p>
<p>產權，供電，選待硏究，現在安東情形怎樣？因爲國軍今夏撤離，已經沒法知道，鞍山去水豐綫路，雖然巳將破壞段落修復，但是電在那裏？</p>
<p>資源委員會東北電力局，曾在民國卅六年元月，致函北朝鮮電力總局，說明民國二十六年四月二十一日「滿」鮮所訂鴨綠江發電事業共同經營的合同織續有效——原合同有效期間爲卅五年，並對產權和供電兩點，有所說明，所得到的是等待！</p>
<p>東北電力資源，永力可供發電的地方，前經日本勘測結果，除了豐滿，水豐，鏡泊湖三處外，所有東北境內鴨綠，松花，遼河，圖們，龍江等水系，所供發常的地方，尙有五十餘處，發電能力，共計可達七百餘萬瓩。</p>
<p>水利發電，無論就為力的生產，或是在消費方面，都有它的獨特優越條件，只要政局安定，政府作有計劃的開發，那麼事北全境電氣化和工業化的時候，也正是東北負起全國經濟建設「總工廠」重任的日子！（韓淸濤）</p>

<h3>紡調會劉代主委談　最近紗布漲價原因　日後產量增加必可趨於正常　聯合配銷希望廠商合作推行</h3>
<p>紡調會代理主委劉泗英，頃對紗布價格不斷上漲，及聯合配紗等問題，向肥者發表談話稱：最近棉紗漲價原因，主要在於電力燃料不足，致生產大受影響。月前每家紗廠平均每星期僅開工四日，倘其餘三日究全開工，即可增加紗布生產量三分之一以上。劉氏繼稱：政府對此極爲注意，決設法節省不必要之電力，移充生產事業。本市參議會亦已通過此項決議，同時政府正協助紗廠自力發電·所需三千噸燃料（煤斤）亦已如數充份供應。故今後紗廠現有紗錠，可全部開工，生產量當能大增。據渠觀察，目前紗布漲風爲一時之象，日後產量增加，供銷必可趨於正常。關於聯合配銷，劉代主委稱：在實行之前，決先舉辦存紗登記。登記辦法，正由小組會審議中，俟委員會議通過後實行。據劉氏解釋、聯合配紗與存紗登記，爲政府旣定政策。惟爲取得廠商合作，共同推行此項政策，決廣　廠商方面意見，俾實施時能順利推行云。</p>

<h3>無許可證抵埠貨物　約値七千萬美金　有關人士表示兩種意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於無許可證之抵埠貨物之數量，迄未確定，但據有關人士表示：「內中准許進口類之貨物約四千萬美金，蓮同限額進口品在內，約七千萬美元。外傳在一億美元以上者，當係指包括一部份汽車在內。關於此筆物資之處理，官價收購之說已成過去，除奢侈品外，其餘均將以加稅代替罰金，惟盼政府能將貨物之性質分類，然後分別處理，對於生產工具及原料，應酌予優待」。</p>
<p>又某商界領袖稱：「本人主張原則上政府可准許此批商品，因畢竟爲中國人之財產，但因數月來物價之激變，　有此物資之商人巳獲利無算；間時物價仍在波動中，商人取得入口許可後，極可能將其囤積而不顯出售。故玫府在允許進口後，應强制商人將此批物資即刻出售於消費機關，例如原料費給工廠、白報紙售與報館，如此對於生產事業及物價穩定，方有良好影響」。</p>

<h3>港粵通天證宣布解凍　影響本巿原料漲　進出口業盼望開放無證進口物資</h3>
<p>港粤貿易，自粤九龍關於九月廿二日宣布「通天證」凍結後，一般商業均已趨於極度袞落狀態。因九龍關發佈取銷之命令，過於忽促，以致商人均未及準備。據悉已報關而未能完稅輸入國內之物資，達百餘萬港幣之多。另在商人手中尙未報關之「通天證」票面額，亦達港幣三百餘萬元以上。故港粤商人因損失過鉅，曾向港稅務署及九龍關方面請願。昨據本市某進出口業方面消息，九龍關爲體卹商艱起見，業於本月二日宣布，九月廿二日以前所發出之「通天證」，恢復通用。此項消息公佈後，港地「通天證」之市價即由三成半高漲至五成七。至九月廿二日以後之「通天證」，因仍須有票面金額及貨品之種種限制，而無人過問。同時港地之工業原料，亦即隨「通天證」之解凍而高漲。例如工業原料之月牌哥士的，二日上午之市價爲港幣八九〇元，下午即昂達九二〇元。英國哥士的亦由八四〇元漲至八七〇元。英國硫化靑由六二〇元漲至六五〇元。美國紅底硫化元靑且已漲至五四〇元。漲風之熾，爲近月來所僅見。據本市某進出口業鉅子表示，港粤「通天證」之恢復使用，對活潑港粤二地之貿易，固可見效一時。然因港地工業原料之狂漲，而本市工業原料存底極度空虛之時，必然將隨之上漲。故亟盼政府能從速開放自備外匯到埠無證之輸入品，旣可解救本市工業原料之恐慌，且可抑平市價。</p>

<h3>分子之速度</h3>
<p>— 曾石虞</p>
<p>吾人對於分子之概念可藉亞伏格鉅羅定律－即氣體在相同之情况同發積內皆含同個數之分子－以確定之（參看本刋第一期）。惟各氣體之分子果皆具若何之特性乎？氣體之公子並非吾人可以目見，但最使人可以體識分子之性質者即英擴散之作用。例如以有色或有香之氣態物質置於一處，不久其色即漸淡而終消，其香亦四散而無跡。其所以如此者，乃由於氣體之分子具有向各方竄進之運動。緣此運動，故聚有色有香之氣體於一處，此氣體即愈久愈散，卒至於原來之地點不能更察覺其存在。</p>
<p>分子旣有運動，則每一分子之速度果可知之乎？今設想於室之一端忽有一　花之美眷徐來，吾人若位於室之另一端，於微聞衣香或花香之頃，常須歷時至數分鐘，是以氣體乃顯然爲一進行甚緩之作用，果氣體分子之速度亦迂遲若是乎？吾人若念，一室之內，氣體之分子其爲數之多，乃一極大而不易想像之數値，當一具有香味之分子，於室之一角脫離此美眷之衣襟，而卒達於室中另一角之立者之嗅官，其間不知曾經歷若干次與其他分子之碰學。此類碰擊或使之前進或使之後退，或使之趨右，或使之傾左，當其於室中移動徑寸之距離，必受千迴百折之打擊，故氣體之擴散乃一速度甚小之作用，但擴散之速度不可即視之爲氣體分子自身運動所具之速度也。</p>
<p>分子散於空中旣有碰擊，取同一類氣體之分子，於同一之情况下（如同溫同壓）果其速度亦皆相同乎？分子問因有相互之碰擊，吾人縱取同類之分子置於同一之情况下，然其速度決不易一望其皆相等也。今設想有氧氣甲乙兩分子，以相同之速度，且幾乎取相同之方向，將會於一點同時適有一丙分子亦有相同之速度，但乃自對面而來，亦欲於此點與甲乙兩分子相碰遇。在碰擊之時，甲乙兩分子共以兩倍之動量作用於丙，而丙僅能以一倍之動量作用於甲乙，根據作用與反作用相反而相等之定律，則丙之反作用必等甲乙之作用，故丙於碰擊後必以更多之動量向其原來之方同而退，其速度必較其原來之値幾爲倍增。循此，甲乙兩分子於碰擊後退回時之速度亦必比其原來之速度，將折半矣。是以各氣體分子之速度，縱原爲相等者，於屢經碰擊，必迅即變而各具一特異之速度突。根據概算機率（Probability）之定律，在數目極多之氣體分子巾，速度極大而幾近於無窮之分子其個數必極少；反之速度極小而幾近於零之分子其個數亦極鮮也。故大多數之分子其速度即分配於此兩極限之中。英國物理學家馬克士威耳（Maxwell）依據物理之條件，利用數學之方法，曾推演而求得一分子述度分配之公式。此公式所指示者，即任何氣體之分子，於一定量氣體中其速度可落於一定速度範圍內之機率，乃一包括溫度，分子質量，及速度之函數－惟非一簡單之函數。</p>
<p>取一定量之氣體，其中各分子雖幾乎各有不相同之速度，然一給定之情况下，各氣體之分子皆有一平均之速度也。此亦猶聚衆人於一堂，雖高低各殊，但必有一平均之體高。各氣體與分子之平均速度，吾人若承認馬克士咸耳之公式爲　確者，用歟學之計算固可以求得其値。但吾人若對此全憑理論推得之公式，不欲即信賴者，即須尋問果有較爲簡捷明療之方法，可以推知其平均之速度否？最早作此努力者即爲焦耳（Joule）。彼之出發點，即爲以氣體密閉於一盛器中，盛器上下左右各面，皆受有相等之壓力。此壓力即由於氣體分子密密相續碰擊於此盛器之壁上而復被反擊所起也。根據此壓力之大小，與器內氣體總共之質量，遂可計算其中氣體分子之平均速度。例如通常空氣之分子，循此方法即知其平均速度落於每秒四百公尺與五百公尺之間。此數値即大過氣體擴散之速度，亦遠過人類所習見之速度也。</p>
<p>分子之速度根據推算之方法旣得一如此超異尋常之値，在吾人無法可以直接測量分子速度之前，果有其他已被觀測確定之現象，可用以佐體此非常之速度以與實事相遠乎？物理學者久已測知聲音在空氣之傳速爲每秒三百四十公尺。空氣乃密度極小之物質，此即謂其分子與分子間尙有空曠甚大之距離。聲波之震動乃籍空氣分子之運動與分子間之碰擊以傳遞之，是以吾人可以想像聲波在空氣中傳播之速度必與空氣分子平均之速度相近，且必宜比之爲較小，因藉分子碰擊而傳之聲波其速決不能如分子不受阻碍時可直飛行之快也。聲速旣爲每秒三百四十公尺，則空氣分子平均之速度，旣推知其在每秒四百公尺與五百公尺之問當可信也。更有，以口徑較大之砲彈發射於戰塲，射擊者久有一常遇之經騐。砲彈之初速若未超過每秒四百公尺之時，則砲彈因空氣之阻力而失去其速度也較緩，若砲彈之初速，大過每秒四百公尺以上，則此砲彈於甚短之時問內，即失去此過量之速度。解釋此現象者，則謂當砲彈之初速超過每秒四百公尺時，砲彈之底部即有眞空構成，此眞空對於砲彈即產生吸阻與羅留之作用，因之乃極能減少砲彈過分之速度。砲彈底部之所以有眞空構成者，則由於砲彈飛行之速度已超過空氣分子之平均速度，因之空氣之分子即不能追至砲之底部以充塞其於飛行時在底部後所遺留之空隙也。就此實事，亦可見空氣分子平均之速度，由前所計算而得者實爲不誣。」</p>
<p>近二三十年來因實驗方法之進步，對於氣體分子速度分配之定律及其速度之平均値亦有實驗以驗證之。最初作此實驗者即爲德國之史特恩（Stern）。繼之而起者亦不乏人。所得之結果皆足以證明馬克士威耳之公式與初由氣體壓力所推算之數値均無誤也。</p>
<h3>沙漠動物的習性</h3>
<p>— 觀潮</p>
<p>有些動物，能節制體內水分的損失，來適應乾燥的環境。其適應的方法的一種，就是夜作日息的習性，因爲沙漠裏日間異常乾熟，夜間溫度驟降。如獅子，沙漠狐狸鬣狗（Hyana），以及大多數昆蟲若蠍蜘蛛等，在畫間躱藏於陰處，减少身體的蒸發，夜間出來活動，旣可减少水分的消耗，並且得到露水的濕潤。或有些動物的皮　特別厚，或被有保護皮層，不受强烈日光的影響，好像植物具很厚的角層一樣，也能减少水分的損失。所以沙漠裏的甲壳蟲，照常不畏日光，在畫間隨處飛翔，因牠們有厚的翅鞘來保護的緣故。又如沙漠裏的四脚蛇大多具有鱗甲，也有同樣的功用。北菲和亞洲的沙漠裏的刺甲四脚蛇名爲飛龍（Agamas）體被刺狀的鱗甲，好像披上一襲堅强的戰鬥衣。在澳洲有一種奇異的四脚蛇，體上的鱗甲，還能吸收水分，這顯然的不是保護却是貯藏水分的功用。</p>
<p>有些動物具休眠的習性，很像沙漠裏若干植物能賴種子或潛芽休眠經月或經年，渡過不良的環境。沙漠裏的蝸牛在乾燥的時候，也能停止活動，好像死去。一遇濕潤的空氣就會復活，牠的休眠往往經數年之久。有些蝸牛開始休眠的候，把螺壳的口用泥封閉來保護內部的器官。這種休眠的能力，在沙漠裏水族動物更爲常見。當沙漠上池穴積水時有好些介壳類或蝦蟹類就會出現，過牠們短期的活動，牠們用卵渡過乾燥和缺乏食料的日子。在澳洲有些沙漠的蝦蟹，由卵發生長成，達到二吋半長度之動物體，祗需半個月的時間。這種極度迅速的生長，是沙漠裏一般較簡單動物所通有現象，來適應這乾燥的沙漠環境。</p>
<p>在這裏我們想到一個問題，就是這些生活於沙漠裏動物，如果過到另一個環境，雨量豐富而且分配均勻，那末牠們豈不是繁殖得更快？生長得更好？何以這些動物總是生長於不良的環境，而不能傳佈或蔓衍到沙漠隣近的那些生活條件較好的地方？實際觀察起來，我們不難知道几蛟適合於沙漢環境的動物，是最不適宜生長於多雨的地方。譬如就沙漠植物性質，尤其是散落分佈的情况而言，並不僅因少雨的直接，影響，同時因沙漠的地勢單純，旣無流水使地形起了若何變化，有時風力雖能移動沙邱或雨水構成暫時的河流，決不像多雨區域的地勢那樣複雜，所以沙漠植物在沙漠裏可任意分佈於廣漠之上，而在多雨區域是受到極度的限制了。比較高等動物一樣地亦受僅適應於沙漠的生活。最顯著的是行動極爲迅速，因爲地面平坦而且乾燥，如大戈壁裏野驢，蒙古的野馬，幾和沙漢同樣的顏色，往往聚羣而居，因牠們行動極快，所以在廣漠上露宿，不易受其他兇猛野壽的傷害。甚至那些翅膀發達的鳥類在沙漠裏行走較飛翔爲多。那些善善行走的鳥，翅膀很退化，專適應沙漠的環境，如非洲的鴕鳥是很好的例子。還有許多甲壳虫失去飛揚的能力，祗會很快爬行。還有些不善爬行的動物，往往適於穴居的生活，牠們的四肢恒適於發掘疏鬆的沙土，如非洲的斯秉克蜥蜴（Spink　Lizard）是一種最著名掘穴動物，有時稱爲沙龍。以上種種習性，如果在多雨的和地形複雜的區域不但不能適應，而且受到相當的害處。例如駱駝腿長趾平，祗能很快的行走於沙上，如地面滬濘，則行動極爲困難，且潮濕的空氣，使其失去健康。還有沙漢裏一種小穴鼠，後肢很長，行動健步如飛，牠並無自衛的利器，日間息居於穴，在間出來覓食，有敏捷的聽覺和視覺，能以很短的前肢送食人口，用後肢坐立，因此視錢可達較遠之處，探視敵害。如果這種動物生活於植物豐富的地方，旣難察覺敵害，又不能自由迅速行　，以逃避災難。埃及的小穴鼠並且祗能生活於乾燥的地方，如遇濕潤的空氣，就會渡休眠的生活。另一種適應的性質，往往也使動物不能生活於其他環境。就是動物的顏色常呈黃色，和沙的顏色相似，可以作掩護之用。如在植物豐富的地方，很容易被敵覺察或有殺身之禍。不過也有少數例外的，如獅子的毛色與無特殊攫取食物的性能，原是適應於沙漠的生活，不過牠的强悍和智慧無疑地能使牠生存於其他環境。有些食物物的動物，牠們的適應力很强，原亦能生活於沙漠以外的環境，可是事實上因敵害的普遍或過多，使牠們的分佈受到相當的限制。如沙漠的蝗蟲或蝸牛等動物，在植物豐富時候能迅速繁殖，向沙漢以外區域分佈，但一到新區域，經多數食蟲動物的捕捉，很少的能保留下去。這事實可以說明沙漠裏若干種類的昆蟲，始終不能繁衍到沙漠附近區域的理由</p>
<h3>落棄的話</h3>
<p>— 萬鵬</p>
<p>在雨量充足的熱帶，樹本生長不受阻礙，所以永無落葉現象，可是在溫帶地方，每當秋深，氣溫轉凉的時候，多數植物不能充分營炭素同化作用，和蒸騰作用，而它的生機又不能一時休止，因此就有落葉的現象。有許多植物落葉之後，葉柄脫離的部份非常平滑，如梧桐無花果等。這是因爲葉柄在枝上尙未脫離之前，在葉柄附近就發生了一種特別組織，那就是離層組織，使得葉與枝的交通斷絕了。</p>
<p>普通離層組織生於葉柄基部與枝幹之間，已生離層的葉，因養料缺乏而凋萎，所以切傷正在盛營生活的枝的一部，使其水份的供給停止，葉自然凋萎，於是由離層而落葉了。在葡萄科的地錦，其葉與葉柄身之間；葉柄基部與枝幹之間，均生離層。</p>
<p>離層由數層柔細胞組成，細咆內含有光澤的物質。這就是脂肪，加上銀酸就變爲褐色，在離層未脫離的時候，在它附近的兩側面，可以見其色彩不調和，尤其是肥大的葉柄上更爲明顯。如欲試騐離層是否生成，可以附近組織中之澱粉試騐之，若已生離層，在加碘化鉀液時，葉柄部份不變色，這是證明已生離層了。</p>
<p>這種葉柄的柔細胞是針狀的結晶，所以脫離之後很華潤；落葉後留在痕上的細粒斑點，是經管東的遺痕。</p>
<p>節屆中秋，落葉紛飛，應該識得是什麽緣故了。</p>
<h3>談香烟</h3>
<p>— 忠愷</p>
<p>最近倫敦某醫學雜誌發表化騐香烟氣的報吿說，『其間所含毒品，除尼古丁　　（Nicotine外，尙有一氧化碳（CO），　類（Aldchyde），及麩醛（Furural）等毒品。』　通常烟葉中的尼古丁是與　米酸（Malic　acid）檸檬酸（Ciuic　acid）結合狀態中，但當加熱和還原壓力（Reduced　presure）下（或吸取），它就能分解而出。一氧化碳是由不完全的燃燒所致，至於醛類和麩　是從焚燒那些製烟時爲調整烟味而加入的甘油，甘草精以及其他東西而生成。我們知道一滴尼古丁，可呌貓抽筋而死，三克的尼哥丁可以使人致命。其實一氧化碳亦正不弱，它能立刻與血裏面的血色素作用，使其無力再傳遞氧氣到體素裏面去。酸類是最強烈的刺激品，對於肺葉黏膜，均呈刺戟作用。而微量的　醛，更能引起震顫，顫抽等症。</p>
<p>一枝紙烟，暫時雖能舒展有烟癖者的心神，但更影響其體質健康外，更麻痹他的靈　感覺性。不吸烟的人們切莫輕易惹上了烟癮。</p>
<h3>最新肺病預防苗</h3>
<p>— 惠世</p>
<p>繼BCG之後，最近美國公共健康部國立健康研究院之細菌學家皮加德及海貝爾和阿爾法兩博士等三人宣稱，又有一種新的肺病注射苗出現，對於豚鼠來說，這種新型注射苗之於肺病，其效力與BCG不相上下，而且可能新注射苗有取而代之而廣泛應用之勢。</p>
<p>此種新注射苗係由死者之肺病菌造成，它們係取自田納西州之一肺病者身上，生前是一種極毒惡之病菌；取出後，用一種秘密方法利用紫外光將其殺死。因爲它們是死去的，所以醫生們敢大胆地用它，但在施之於人類以前，仍須經精密小心之研究。</p>
<p>試騐中之豚鼠於服用長後一次注射苗之後一星期，即被施入大量之肺病菌；於是它們都患上肺病，但彼等較未服注射苗而被施肺病菌之豚鼠，生命延長時間要長一倍！</p>
<p>萬能的「飛馬」　鮑忠祈</p>
<p>一個硏究直昇飛機的專家，最近著了一本書，題目是：「萬能的馬」。他以爲直昇飛機就是一隻空中的飛馬，它的性能是驚人的：能帶五百磅重的航空快遞郵件迅速地飛往指定地點；能擔任高空測量的任務；還能將重二千四百磅的吉普車運往他處；而量奏奇效的是代替人力，舖設輸油管，或引導水源，據美國試騐的結果，直昇飛機能够在二十五秒鐘內放下橡皮管四百呎之多呢！</p>
<h3>電視的將來</h3>
<p>— 萬功禹</p>
<p>愛因斯坦—現在世界上最偉大的數學家——是以他的相對論而著名的，他這個學說進確地指示了原子能的原理，他還有另一個很大的成就，就是電視攝影器（Television　camera）的一個新的「眼睛」。（好比是照相機的鏡頭）這個新的眼睛有從前的一千倍的靈敵，我們知道電視攝影器的主要作用是靠一個光電池的光電效應，而這光電池假使很是零　，攝影器就能將極弱的光綫或是極微細的動作傳給收影器。愛因斯坦早在一九〇五年就說過光電效應的定律是同當時一般人所假定者大不相同的，而現在這種新的發明就是他的一九〇五年的指示的直接結果。愛因斯坦的光電效應方程式差不多在實際工作情形之下被應用了四十年之久，終於現在電視有了新的視覺，即使比人眼的視覺還要靈　些－牠的精細的程度，已經能使攝影裝置在黑暗中工作。</p>
<p>對於戰後的一個電視收影機的所有者而言，這等於是一架新的收音機，牠能在任何氣候之下，以燭光或微弱的火柴的閃光，報吿各種運動或新聞，您甚至能用牠看見在下雨時的大水，火災時的熊熊的大火，甚至晚上警察們在街燈之下捕人。</p>
<p>在電視娛樂方面也將有新的發展，你用不着再在許多水銀燈的集中的光綫下很費力地看那小而綳緊的景物，你可以看到舞合上的戲劇，就像在戲院裏一樣，每個細小的動作及景都很完全，這個新的「眼睛」能傳給你在愛情塲面中的溫柔的燈光，或一個謀殺的秘密的塲面中恐怖黯淡的氣氛；即使是一枝紙烟的光亮，在牠的後而有一個大的抽烟者的輪　。換句話說，所有微細的人類的動作－。這結果，就是愛因斯坦在四十年前，恐怕也沒有夢想到吧！</p>

Mrs. Chiang wore a black-bottomed blue flower cheongsam with a light brown毛背心. She frequently talked to female students along the way and looked very happy. The Chairman and his wife left the city at 12:15 PM, accompanied by Yu Jishi and more than ten guards. There were no guards along the eighteen-li route from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace. Farmers and farmers' wives continued their farming without interruption because they did not know that the car traveling on the road was carrying Chairman and Mrs. Chiang. At 12:55 PM, they arrived at the Summer Palace. Mayor He, along with his French wife and Xu Xinyuan, director of the Summer Palace Office, greeted them respectfully at the entrance.

(For the content of the written statements from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, see the seventh column on page two.)</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Province Commissioner Elections; Only Kashgar Region Has Not Yet Been Held</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 4th dispatch] The Xinjiang Provincial Government Propaganda Committee held a press conference on the 4th, hosted by Chairman Liu Mengchun, answering inquiries, stating that Usmani is the Commissioner of Altai appointed by the government. The government's attitude towards him is no different from its attitude towards commissioners in other regions. Not a single soldier from the National Army followed Usmani into Altai. The government deeply sympathizes with the suffering of the people of Altai, who have been in war for seven or eight years, and is considering a third round of relief. Regarding the election of commissioners throughout Xinjiang, elections have already been held in the five districts of Aksu, Yanqi, Shache, Hotan, and Dihua. Elections will be held in the Hami district in the short term. Only in the Kashgar district, because malpractices have occurred in the elections of county magistrates and county councilors, can the commissioner election be held only after the county elections are completed, which will require considerable time.</p>

<h3>Promoting Good Neighborliness; Sino-Mongolian Border Tranquil; Rumor Fu Zuoyi Says Yulin is Also Peaceful</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 5th dispatch] The northern border line of Inner Mongolia is peaceful and uneventful. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi said that the reports of recent intrusions by the Outer Mongolian army are inaccurate. He is promoting a policy of good neighborliness on the border line. Last year, he issued a notice that no matter whether they are Han or Mongolian soldiers and civilians, they are not allowed to carry weapons when traveling to and from the northern border line. If any soldiers or civilians from Outer Mongolia cross the border, they will only be escorted out of the country and will not be punished.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 5th dispatch] Fu Zuoyi said after inspecting Yulin that Yulin is currently peaceful, but since the Communist bandit base in northern Shaanxi moved to Jia County, Yulin should be more vigilant. In early August, the Communist bandits attacked Yulin with all their strength, suffering more than 10,000 casualties. It is not known whether they have any intention of attacking Yulin again recently. According to senior generals from Yulin who came to Beiping, the outposts outside Yulin have been recovered one after another. Although the strength of the National Army is thin, their morale is extremely high. Shenmu has always been firmly defended by the National Army, but Gaojiazhai is in the hands of the bandit army, so there is still a sense of threat. The National Army in Ningxia is currently in the Sanbian area. In the battle of Yulin a month ago, the bandit army broke in twice. The fierceness of the battle can be compared to the Battle of Longtan. The bandit army is well-equipped. In addition to mountain guns, mortar, and flat-trajectory guns, there are also Soviet-style machine guns, and the sound of artillery fire can be clearly heard.</p>
<h3>Distinguished Guests Fly in from Ten Thousand Miles Across the Sea; The Capital Welcomes the British Delegation to China</h3>

Beiping, Shenyang, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Tamsui, Hankou, Chongqing, and Guangzhou will also share the friendship and goodwill they bring from the British Isles in the coming month. Recalling the first British Parliamentary Delegation to China, which visited Chongqing, China's wartime capital, on November 10, 1942, it opened a new page in the history of Sino-British relations and laid the foundation for Sino-British joint operations, which achieved brilliant victories. At that time, Chairman Chiang said when welcoming the delegation: "You have taken the trouble of a long journey to visit our country, bringing us the friendship of the great British nation, and will understand the Chinese people's expectations for the people of your country in the future, thereby strengthening the alliance between our two countries in the same boat through thick and thin.". Subsequently, on December 3, 1943, our country's delegation to Britain was invited to visit Britain, further promoting understanding and cooperation between the two countries. Borrowing the words of the British Foreign Minister Wendeng at the time: "Our two peoples have many things in common, and these many, many unlimited commonalities will further promote our cooperation in the important years to come." It also explains the achievements of our country's delegation to Britain. (The itinerary of the delegation to China is in the sixth column on page two)</p>

<h3>Formal Announcement from the Control Yuan: Report on Foreign Exchange Usage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Control Yuan formally announced on the 5th a "Report on Foreign Exchange Usage and Business Reporting of Various Companies," exceeding 15,000 characters. This report provides a detailed and factual account of the use of foreign exchange in our country and the operation of major companies engaged in import and export trade, which has been the focus of national attention, from August 19, 1945, to the end of August this year. According to reports in domestic and foreign newspapers around March of this year, there were continuous reports of "government-run commercial enterprises," such as Yitong Company, Fuzhong Company, and China Construction Bank Company, taking advantage of "privileges" to settle and purchase large amounts of foreign exchange and import large quantities of prohibited goods. This aroused dissatisfaction from Chinese and foreign merchants and criticism from various parties. Subsequently, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Central Supervisory Committee sent letters to the Control Yuan requesting a thorough investigation. The Control Yuan dispatched supervisory committee members Du Guang, He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Guanwu, auditor Wan Bin from the Auditing Department, and co-auditor Chen Huayuan to investigate relevant agencies and companies in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. After spending more than twenty days, the investigation was largely completed, and a report was drafted and submitted to the Yuan. The Yuan has forwarded the report to the National Government for review. The report first traces the evolution of the government's foreign exchange control and institutions from August 19, 1945, to August 17, 1947. It then reports the amount of foreign exchange used in each period, calculated as follows: From August 19, 1945, to March 3, 1946: US$64,200,845.95 (combined value of various foreign currencies). From March 4, 1946, to February 15, 1947: US$401,663,501.93, £17,635,564, HK$27,874,769.13. From February 16, 1947, to August 30 of the same year: US$150 million.</p>
<p>Settlement of Foreign Exchange and Business Operations of the Three Companies</p>
<p>The report then individually presents and exposes the circumstances of major public companies settling foreign exchange and engaging in import and export trade. The Fuzhong Company settled US$1,585,086.09, with a foreign exchange income of US$137,817.43, but nearly half of the imported materials were automobiles. It was also noted that the company's responsibilities with its New York branch were unclear, which caused much concern. The Yangzi Company had settled US$2,820,411.03, £21,041, and Swiss Francs 45,333. The unsettled foreign exchange was US$903,684.72 and £1,386. Although most of its imported materials were cotton and medicines, the nominally separate relationship between the company and the American Yangtze Trading Company needs further investigation. The China Construction Bank Company settled foreign exchange of US$877.62, which was indeed used to purchase daily office supplies, and there was no waste of large amounts of foreign exchange. However, an interesting piece of news revealed in the report is that the company's operating loss for the period reached National Currency $142,700,178. Song Ziwen's nominal investment was valued at $250,000 in pre-war currency. Furthermore, the report pointed out that responsible personnel of the above-mentioned companies used diplomatic passports to engage in trade activities in the United States, listing Song Ziliang, general manager of Fuzhong Company, who used the title of special envoy for transportation investigation; Shen Henian, assistant manager of the company, who used the title of accompanying secretary of former Foreign Minister Song; and Song Zi'an, general manager of China Construction Bank Company, who used the title of attendant secretary of the Military Affairs Commission's attendant office, all of whom went abroad one after another and have not yet returned.</p>
<p>Eight Conclusions and Recommendations Provide Basis for Punishment</p>
<p>After detailing the above-mentioned investigation results, this lengthy report puts forward the following eight conclusions and recommendations to provide the government with a basis for punishment and a reference for selection: The government originally had 6 million ounces of gold and US$900 million in reserves, but most of it was consumed in the import of non-construction materials within two years. Since the currency system has not been reformed and prices have not been stabilized, former President Song Ziwen should be held responsible for the inappropriate measures taken. The foreign exchange control agencies and methods have been changed frequently, leaving the people at a loss. In the future, more comprehensive decisions should be made. In the future, imports should expand daily necessities and strictly prohibit consumer goods. The criticisms from foreign countries regarding our import and export trade methods may be due to a lack of understanding of the facts or malicious exaggeration. Based on actual investigations, the so-called exclusion of foreign merchants is unfounded. Industrial and commercial enterprises and individuals should not participate in the Central Supreme Economic Decision-Making Authority, as this could lead to the leakage of national policies. The Ministry of Finance should investigate and deal with the Traffic, Jin Cheng, and China National Goods Banks separately for investing in and operating the China Construction Bank Company, which violates banking regulations. The passports of responsible persons of major companies who engage in trade activities abroad under false pretenses should be revoked. Imported materials that have not been approved for import but have already arrived at the port should be processed promptly. (The full text of the report can be found on page 2, section 1.)</p>

<h3>Veto Power and Our Country's Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>According to reports, the Chinese delegation has proposed to the United Nations General Assembly: "Whenever international disputes are being resolved, the Security Council should automatically waive its veto power, but it does not advocate amending the United Nations Charter, but only requests that the nature of the automatic waiver of veto power be clarified." According to a Central News Agency dispatch, the Chinese proposal is expected to be opposed by the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union firmly refuses to consider "unauthorized changes" to the Security Council's veto power. The representatives of the other three powers have not yet made any formal comments. The arrival of this news seems somewhat contradictory to our country's request to reserve veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan. Our country's advocacy of retaining veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan seems to be closer to the Soviet Union's viewpoint, while the proposal submitted to the General Assembly to limit the scope of the use of veto power is contrary to the Soviet Union's policy. Therefore, some political commentators believe that our country does not have a clear foreign policy. We believe that at this time, it is indeed necessary to briefly clarify our country's foreign policy.</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that the reservation of veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan and the restriction on the use of veto power in the General Assembly and Security Council are fundamentally two different matters. The drafting of the Treaty of Peace with Japan is not within the purview of the United Nations organization. Therefore, the reservation of veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan and the restriction on the use of veto power in the General Assembly and Security Council cannot be confused. Regarding the Treaty of Peace with Japan, the National Political Council and the Foreign Ministry's Treaty of Peace with Japan Review Committee have both given careful consideration and believe that the Soviet Union must participate in the Treaty of Peace with Japan, and the four powers in the peace conference must retain veto power. Because China and Japan are geographically close and have suffered from the aggression of Japanese warlords for a long time, causing severe harm, in order to ensure its own safety, it cannot allow the resurgence of Japanese aggression. Therefore, it is particularly concerned about the Treaty of Peace with Japan. Furthermore, there are still many issues to be resolved between China and the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union cannot be excluded from the treaty. Although China's decision-making on the Treaty of Peace with Japan may outwardly resemble that of the Soviet Union, it is entirely based on an independent position, and its significance may not be the same as that of the Soviet Union. As for the issue of veto power, Premier Zhang stated at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee on September 9 this year: "China believes that the charter should not be fundamentally amended to abolish veto power, but it believes that a reasonable interpretation should be established to restrict its abuse." Foreign Minister Wang, in his statement before attending the United Nations General Assembly in the United States, also pointed out regarding the issue of veto power in the United Nations Security Council: "My government believes that the solution to such an important issue lies in establishing a general and reasonable interpretation of the veto power stipulated in the Charter through agreement among all parties, rather than in the amendment of the Charter itself, and amending the Charter is currently unlikely to be realized." It can be seen that our country does not advocate amending the United Nations Charter, but adopts restrictions on the use of veto power in the Security Council, which has always been a consistent policy. What we want to particularly point out here is that the restriction on the use of veto power in the Security Council and the abolition of veto power in the Security Council are two different things. What we advocate is that the use of veto power by powerful countries in the Security Council should be restricted to prevent its abuse; this does not mean that we advocate abolishing the veto power system in the Security Council, nor does it mean that we advocate abandoning the use of veto power in the Security Council. This is a very important point.</p>
<p>Speaking of our foreign policy, it has its own consistent principles and firm stance. It can be summarized into four characters, which are: impartiality, righteousness, and peace. Foreign Minister Wang pointed out at the Chongqing National Political Council session in February last year, our foreign policy: "To do our best to enhance the unity of the United Nations, especially the unity of the major powers. To achieve this goal, first, we do not follow the traditional diplomatic strategy of allying with any one country or group to confront other countries. Second, we adhere to the position of justice in all matters, right is right, and wrong is wrong." Premier Zhang also pointed out at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee: "The basic requirement of China's diplomacy is to strive for world peace so that China can obtain stability and opportunities for construction; the government must strive to maintain its friendly relations with its major allies on the one hand and support the United Nations to promote cooperation among the major powers on the other hand." Because our foreign policy is impartial, righteous, and peaceful, we support the United Nations as an international organization, promote cooperation among the major powers to maintain world peace, and strive to maintain our friendly relations with our major allies. Based on this national policy, China's foreign relations are neither pro-Soviet nor pro-American, let alone anti-Soviet or anti-American, and especially not like being pro-American and anti-Soviet today and pro-Soviet and anti-American tomorrow. Recently, some American political commentators have thought that China will use a pro-Soviet stance to "intimidate" or "coerce" the United States. This argument may be due to misunderstandings caused by Vice President Sun's personal remarks, but it can also be seen that they do not yet have a correct understanding of China's foreign policy. At the same time, the Soviet Union's argument is that China is pro-American and anti-Soviet. We are willing to stand on an impartial position to seek world peace. When talking about China's foreign policy, the editorial of this newspaper once pointed out: "We are friends with all nations that are friendly to us. The Confucian tradition of China for two thousand years only knows loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, respect, kindness, and neighborliness..." This is our impartial position.</p>
<p>As for safeguarding the integrity of territory and sovereignty, this is a decision that any independent country must have, and it in itself is not enough to constitute the main body of foreign policy. In the past, because of the existence of unequal treaties, one of the purposes of our national movement was to abolish these unequal treaties to ensure the integrity of our territory and sovereignty. Therefore, at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and the Washington Conference in 1921, our country's efforts were directed in this direction. Currently, because the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship has not been faithfully implemented, there is still room for our continued efforts in this regard. We have always maintained the dignity of treaties, so we demand the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. China is willing to abide by its treaty obligations, but if the Soviet Union does not comply, we will definitely argue on the basis of reason. This is the backbone of our Soviet policy. As for China's policy toward the United States, there is no need to say more that it is willing to consolidate and enhance the traditional friendship between the two countries. The United States fought alongside us during the war, and after the war, it left prisoners of war to accept surrender, which gave us a lot of help. In the future, there will be many opportunities for Sino-American cooperation in international politics, and we have no reason to be easily alienated by others. However, some American allies have quite correct views on the situation in China, which can serve as a medicine for our self-reflection and self-improvement, but regarding the difficulties China has encountered since its victory in the war, they may not fully understand them due to the exaggerated propaganda of those with ulterior motives. Therefore, China must seek mutual understanding between the two countries to strengthen its alliance of cooperation, which goes without saying. On the American side, how its China policy is, whether it will extend the spirit of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan for European aid to China, is a matter for the United States itself. After the Second World War, the American government and people will definitely be able to make choices based on experience. We do not need to make plans here that exceed our responsibilities.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Supervisory Yuan Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Supervisory Yuan released today the "Investigation Report on the Use of Foreign Exchange and the Business Operations of Various Companies" submitted by Supervisory Committee members Du Guangxun and others, together with Wan Rongbin and others from the Audit Department. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the victory of our country in the War of Resistance, foreign communication and trade relations have been restored, and after the war, everything is waiting to be rebuilt. However, the government's finances are extremely difficult, prices are rising daily, and there is currency inflation. Therefore, the foreign exchange issue has gradually become a major issue in the national economy and financial sector, attracting great attention from all parties. Not only have the financial authorities made repeated changes to the management of foreign exchange facilities, but they have also consistently kept the actual situation and figures of foreign exchange use secret, preventing the outside world from understanding. As a result, rumors abound, and criticisms are increasing daily. In early March of this year, the 223rd Standing Committee Meeting of the National Defense Supreme Committee, based on the proposal of Committee member Zhang Ji and others, resolved that "all foreign exchange cases approved by the government shall be handed over to the Supervisory Yuan to order the Audit Department to investigate in detail and report." The Yuan then ordered the Audit Department and Supervisory Committee member Du Guangxun and others to investigate. However, due to the inability to access banking records, a detailed investigation could not be conducted, resulting in a lack of comprehensive public reporting on the situation of this case. On March 13th of this year, United Press Shanghai reported: "China's state-owned enterprises recently purchased tens of thousands of U.S. dollars worth of import fees, completely ignoring the exchange restrictions and import regulations imposed on private Sino-American individuals since last November. It is understood that Yitong Company, Central Trust Bureau, and China Supplies Bureau are currently importing large quantities of 'luxury goods,' such as high-priced cars, wireless radios, iceboxes, and other items that China should avoid and strictly prohibits importing. Meanwhile, thousands of import permits and exchange requests from private businesses for urgently needed legitimate imports such as heavy industrial equipment are being ignored by the authorities." Furthermore, sources in the shipping industry confirmed that most of these luxury goods were ordered by government-related businesses for supply to private buyers, and it is rumored that they were ordered by government officials to profit from them. Chinese business figures pointed out that Yitong Company is an agent of the Central Trust Bureau, ordering foreign goods at low prices and charging a 1% commission when reselling them to private businesses. As a result, Sino-American businesses make very little profit, insufficient to cover expenses, making it difficult for them to compete with "government-run" businesses. Sino-American businessmen also voiced numerous criticisms of Fuzhong Company, supported by T.V. Soong, China Construction Bank Company of T.A. Soong, and Yangzi Construction Company of H.H. Kung, for being able to use "privileges" to engage in commerce. For example, one representative of Fuzhong Company is currently traveling commercially in the United States using a Chinese diplomat's passport, while experienced Chinese business leaders who wish to go to the United States are often unable to obtain permission. Recently, American businesses in Washington and New York have protested to the State Department about the aforementioned "privileged businesses," accusing them of using political and other pressures to exclude foreign merchants from China. While many American business leaders in China are unwilling to discuss this publicly, most also acknowledge that the situation that prompted the protest a month ago still exists and believe there is very little hope for improvement." On July 1st of this year, the New York Evening Post reprinted a dispatch from the China correspondent of the Associated Press, Ren Earl, which also contained similar criticisms of our country's import trade (see Observation, Volume 2, Issue 22). At the same time, domestic newspapers and magazines competed to publish news about the government's wasteful use of foreign exchange and the use of privileges by import and export trading companies such as Fuzhong and Yangzi to obtain foreign exchange and purchase luxury goods. The committee members were ordered to thoroughly investigate. After consulting relevant files from various Yuan and departments, and going to Shanghai to collect information, audit accounts, and seek opinions from banks, import and export trading companies, and customs, the various situations obtained from the investigation and the conclusions drawn from the analysis and research based on various materials are reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>First, Investigated Facts</p>
<p>(A) Evolution of Foreign Exchange Management Institutions</p>
<p>The National Government's foreign exchange management institutions have undergone numerous changes since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department by the Central Bank in March of the 27th year [1938]. In July of the 27th year, the Foreign Exchange Department was established under the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance. In April of the 28th year [1939], the Ministry of Finance re-established the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee. In October of the 28th year, the Joint Treasury also established the Exchange Department. In September of the 30th year [1941], the Executive Yuan established the Foreign Exchange Management Committee and the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. In January of the 32nd year [1943], the Foreign Exchange Management Committee was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. On April 16th of the 34th year [1945], the Foreign Exchange Management Committee was ordered to be abolished. The original functions of the committee, except for a portion that remained under the Ministry of Finance, regarding the examination of purchase applications, the handling of export exchange settlements, the control of the foreign exchange market, and the investigation and research of foreign exchange management, were all transferred to the Central Bank. Within the Bureau of Business, the Foreign Exchange Section and the Foreign Exchange Management Section were established. Regarding applications for the purchase of foreign exchange, initially, the President of the Bank, H.H. Kung, personally reviewed them. From May 14th to June 8th of the same year, Kung approved 302 foreign exchange cases via telegram from the United States, totaling US$2,690,104.93. Subsequently, a telegram was presented to the Chairman for approval to establish a Foreign Exchange Examination Committee within the Bank, which was established on June 16th of the 34th year. H.H. Kung and Yu Hongjun served as directors successively. During this period, the examination standards and approval procedures were very strict, so the amount of foreign exchange approved was also very small. After the victory of the War of Resistance, transportation was restored, and international trade was frequent. After T.V. Soong became the President of the Executive Yuan, he promulgated the Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management of the Central Bank and the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on March 4th of the 35th year [1946]. The Foreign Exchange Examination Department was established in the Central Bank, and 29 banks, including Guangdong Bank, were designated as designated banks to engage in foreign exchange business. For government agencies applying for foreign exchange, the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Finance approved and notified the Central Bank to sell accordingly. All import remittances from overseas Chinese and individual applications were handled by designated banks. The weekly foreign exchange income and expenditure figures and individual applications were handled by the designated banks, who then reported the total amounts along with the applications to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. Surplus foreign exchange was sold to the Central Bank, and any shortfall was supplied by the Central Bank at the official price. At that time, international transportation was restored, and the types of imported goods restricted were very few. The Central Bank supplied the difference between foreign exchange inflows and outflows as much as possible, and the power to approve foreign exchange settlements for merchants and individuals was in fact exercised by the designated banks. The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank merely reviewed the weekly reports of these banks afterward. This was the most liberal period for foreign exchange use, and also the period with the highest foreign exchange expenditure (see Appendices 1 and 2). Subsequently, due to excessive imports of foreign goods, the Central Bank's unrestricted supply of foreign exchange to the market was also running low, and the difference between the official foreign exchange rate and the black market foreign exchange rate became increasingly large (see Appendix 3), the losses suffered by the country became greater. The Central Bank then promulgated revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on November 17th of the 35th year, establishing a Provisional Import Management Committee, adopting an import permit system, and implementing a prior application and examination method for foreign exchange. Import trade was thus subject to certain restrictions (see Appendix 4). By February of this year, due to the gold rush, the foreign exchange black market became even more rampant. The government then announced emergency economic measures, adopting stricter controls on foreign exchange, tightening restrictions on imported goods, and suppressing the foreign exchange black market. Thus, foreign exchange management transitioned from a situation of extreme laissez-faire to one of extreme control. The foreign exchange expenditure has been greatly reduced compared to the amount of foreign exchange used from March 4th to November 17th of the 35th year. However, because the government limited the price of foreign exchange to a fixed official price of 12,000, while the black market flourished, overseas remittances and other foreign exchange income decreased daily, and foreign trade could not be conducted. The foreign exchange held by the government decreased daily, so on August 17th of this year, a method was announced to determine the market price of foreign exchange on a daily basis, in addition to the fixed official price of 12,000, in order to thoroughly eliminate the foreign exchange black market and increase foreign exchange income. Furthermore, on August 18th, the permission to import all goods with self-provided foreign exchange was suspended in order to make even more stringent restrictions. This is a general overview of our government's foreign exchange management since the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>(B) Foreign Exchange Usage</p>
<p>The procedures and situation of foreign exchange usage during the above periods: (1) From August 19th of the 34th year [1945] to March 3rd of the 35th year, was the period of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Committee. The standards and regulations for its examination were the Measures for Individuals Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange, the Measures for Insurance Businesses Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange, the Measures for Government Agencies and Business Agencies Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange, and the Measures for Wartime Industrial and Commercial Businesses Purchasing Foreign Exchange. At that time, restrictions were very strict, and transportation was also extremely difficult. Except for cases specially approved by the Chairman and cases approved by the Ministry of Finance and then submitted to the committee for retroactive approval, individual applications for foreign exchange were limited to tuition fees for students studying abroad, medical treatment expenses for those who could not be treated in the country, expenses for purchasing self-use medicines that could not be purchased in the country, travel expenses and living expenses for government personnel going abroad, and life insurance premiums. Industrial and commercial businesses were limited to insurance, film companies, and equipment and raw materials approved by the War Production Bureau. Moreover, there were not many actual applicants, and most of them were applications from government agencies. During this period, a total of US$8,997,082.02, GBP 2,010,374, and INR 23,395,100 were sold, totaling US$64,200,845.95. Among them, applications from agencies accounted for 87%, individual applications accounted for only 2%, and industrial and commercial applications accounted for 11%. This shows that the use of foreign exchange by government agencies was not strictly restricted at that time, while general industrial and commercial businesses and individuals were subject to extreme control (see the Audit Department's report to the Yuan in March of this year). During this period, of all 2,000 foreign exchange application cases, the Audit Department dispatched personnel to review them in March of this year under the order of the Yuan. As a result, it was found that there were eight cases where individual applications did not comply with regulations but were approved as exceptions. There were two cases where the original applications were from private individuals but were listed as applications from government agencies and did not comply with regulations. The total was only over US$33,000 and over INR 10,600 (see the Audit Department's report to this Yuan).</p>
<p>(2) From March 4th to November 16th of the 35th year, was the period of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department. The standards and regulations for its examination were the Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management of the Central Bank and the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. Government agencies applying for foreign exchange were initially approved in part by the Ministry of Finance, and later all were approved by the Executive Yuan. The foreign exchange business operated by designated banks, in addition to export goods, overseas Chinese remittances, and individual applications, was mainly import trade. Moreover, the bank supplied foreign exchange applications as much as possible. At that time, the difference between the black market exchange rate and the official rate was still small, and for some goods for which it was not easy to apply for foreign exchange, manufacturers often purchased and imported them with their own foreign exchange. Therefore, the value of imports was actually much higher than that approved by the designated banks. After September, the Central Bank gradually tightened restrictions on imported goods. As a result, the foreign exchange black market was 50% higher than the official price, and the value of goods for which import approval was applied for increased daily. Therefore, there were strict restrictions on prior examination on November 17th. During this period, according to the Audit Department's review by personnel dispatched in March of this year, in addition to finding that designated banks had sold foreign exchange directly without the approval of the bank in cases of special circumstances, and had sold foreign exchange to those who had not obtained import permits, and the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank had sent letters to correct them, but not all of them had complied. Regarding the investigation of foreign exchange applications from government agencies, because the Executive Yuan's foreign exchange examination work had no fixed examination institution at that time, and there were no detailed regulations, the approval was either done by the Executive Yuan's official documents or decided by former President Soong himself, instructing the bank to allocate and sell foreign exchange. There were many cases where the formal procedures were obviously not followed. Several examples are listed below: 1. The foreign exchange diary account of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank on April 5th of the 35th year, lists a handwritten note from former President Soong saying: "The government allocates US$100,000 to the family of Guo Shi Wu as a reward for the family's donation of the porcelain collection, which has been approved by the Yuan meeting. Please immediately issue ten checks for US$10,000 each from the China Bank in New York, to be collected by Guo Zhaojun" (the original note is kept at the Central Bank). Was the Guo family donating porcelain in the United States? What was it used for? Where was it kept? Inquiries to the Executive Yuan revealed that there were no files to be found. To spend such a large amount of foreign exchange, which was not a military or political emergency, and to not follow normal procedures, is truly perplexing. 2. On April 11th of the 35th year, former President Soong sent an English note to Bei Zuyi stating: "T.V. Soong on behalf of the government purchased three ships from the Canadian government for CAD 5,750,000.00. I have telegraphed Xi Demao (China Bank in New York) to first pay T.A. Soong CAD 1,575,000.00, and pay the full amount when preparing to depart. Please also instruct Xi Demao to reimburse." (The original English note and translation are kept at the Central Bank). The Central Bank immediately contacted Xi Demao, and as a result, on April 23rd, sent a letter to the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, requesting permission to allocate funds for reimbursement, and reported to the Executive Yuan. However, there was no formal document in the file from the Treasury Department approving reimbursement or from the Executive Yuan regarding the entire ship purchase. A total of CAD 1,580,028.78 was paid for the three ships. The advance payment of CAD 310,000.00 was converted to CNY 569,272,723.60, which was requested from the Treasury Department for reimbursement on April 23rd of the 35th year. Another CAD 1,270,028.78 was paid on July 15th, converted to CNY 2,565,458,135.60, which was listed as a debt of the Ministry of Finance on July 20th. 3. From March 4th of the 35th year to February 15th of the 36th year, foreign ships were chartered to transport coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. The freight was paid in foreign exchange, totaling US$8,454,290.00 and GBP 497,431, accounting for almost half of the total US dollars and over half of the total British pounds of individual and non-import foreign exchange during this period. According to the general order issued by the Executive Yuan in August of the 35th year, all expenses within China, regardless of the sale of goods or compensation for work, should be calculated in legal tender, except for those specially approved by the government, and should not be paid in foreign currency. The payment of the aforementioned large amount of foreign exchange, even if specially approved by former President Soong at a time when foreign exchange sources were difficult, is still wasteful. In addition, the import of all kinds of goods, such as canned goods, fruits, and glassware, was too free, so foreign exchange consumption was the highest during this period.</p>

<h3>Content of Talks Between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Cui Xin, a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, stated in a written statement on the 5th that, regarding the nomination of political parties to participate in the general election, a consensus has not yet been reached due to various difficulties. The Democratic Socialist Party believes that if the elections are not nominated by political parties but become a situation of free individual competition, then whether any members of this party are elected, or how many are elected, is not a concern. If this method is adopted, this party does not intend to participate in a coalition government, but will express its views on national affairs as a purely opposition party. As for the minority parties' request to participate in local councils, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the outside world, and some even say that it violates democratic principles. In fact, selecting a small number of members to participate in public opinion institutions not only does not have any undemocratic implications, but also conforms to the deliberative spirit of democracy. This is because one party has been under tutelage for 20 years, and other parties have no other opportunities to express the views of some of the people they represent. Minority parties attach great importance to participating in local councils. If it is not achieved, they will have no way to express their views, and participating in the government is unnecessary.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] After the Chinese Youth Party's Central Headquarters held a Central Standing Committee meeting on the 5th, spokesman Wang Shizeng issued a written statement on the issue of the Youth and Democratic Parties participating in provincial, county, and municipal councils and the nomination of political parties for the general election, stating: "The State Council's decision to select representatives from the Youth and Democratic Parties to participate in local public opinion institutions is based on the provisions of the Common Policy Guidelines. The State Council's decision based on the provisions of the Common Policy Guidelines cannot be said to be illegal. China has not yet entered a truly democratic stage, and many of the political orders related to promoting democracy are expedient measures for the transitional period. Taking the provincial, county, and municipal councils as an example, when their term expires and they should be re-elected, the government can also order an extension of one year. The immediate reason for the Youth and Democratic Parties' request to participate in local public opinion institutions is that the term of the provincial, municipal, and county councils has already been extended, and it is impossible to coordinate with the general election to participate in the election of local public opinion organs. Regarding the issue of whether selected representatives can coexist with elected representatives, the facts of the constitutional National Assembly and the National Political Council can answer this question. This party believes that the Kuomintang will be able to uphold the principle of Item 6 of the Constitutional Implementation Preparation Plan passed by its Sixth National Congress, Third Plenary Session, and sincerely support other peaceful and legal political parties to facilitate the rational advancement of constitutionalism," and so on.</p>
<h3>Case of Corruption in the Handling of Enemy Property in Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Continued from page one] It is reported that the secret reports include a total of twelve items: (1) From last year to April of this year, a total of 9,000 tons of unsold materials were transported away. Who handled them and how were they disposed of? (2) Over CNY 7 billion in national taxes were owed for the transported materials. (3) How much enemy and puppet property was taken over in Qingdao? Why were different discounts applied when applying to purchase enemy property, reducing them again and again? (4) How much property was transferred by the enemy, how much was auctioned, how much was lost, and how much remains? (5) How much property and enemy property was seized due to secret reports? Were the whistleblowers rewarded in accordance with regulations? (6) How much was the total assets of the enemy naval food factory on Guancheng Road? How were they handled? (7) The base price of the total assets of the enemy exchange was CNY 3 billion. Why was it sold for CNY 200 million? (8) What is the relationship between the Aquatic Products Company and Yizhong Company and the director? (9) How much was the total amount of materials and assets of the enemy North China Fisheries Association? (10) How was the Yinzhong Warehouse on Jiaozhou Road managed and disposed of? (11) Where were the enemy's leftover oak wood from the backyard of No. 23 Chengkou Road transported? (12) The enemy's leftover lumber at No. 19 Jinkou Road was discovered due to a secret report. Why was no reward issued in accordance with regulations? It is said that there is solid evidence for all of the above items. In the midst of the crackdown on corruption, all parties attach great importance to this.</p>

<p>Full Text of the Chairman's Address</p>
<p>To all members of the 10th National Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers: Your association's annual meeting this time gathers prominent figures from the engineering field nationwide, convening in the capital to discuss major plans for future construction. Its significance is extremely important, and its responsibility is even more arduous. It is hoped that you will, based on the spirit of courageous struggle in the War of Resistance, further promote and expand it, understand the urgent needs of the current people's livelihood, coordinate with the actual situation of resource undertakings in various regions, first seek effective consolidation, and lay a foundation for development. Prioritize the essentials and pay attention to the order of things, be practical and successful step by step, so that rural industrialization will progress day by day, and the modernization of industry will be initiated. Then, land can fully utilize its benefits, and people can fully utilize their talents. With our country's abundant endowment, we will surely overcome economic difficulties and bring the people's livelihood to a realm of prosperity and happiness. It is deeply hoped that this annual meeting will achieve special accomplishments in this regard, and the government will make its best efforts to realize it. I urge you to work harder. Zhongzheng.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The topic "Intensify Construction to Save the Current Social and Economic Crisis" was passed in the engineers' annual meeting on the 5th. It listed four points regarding the construction that needs to be intensified currently: (1) Focus on increasing material production and employment as the main goals. (2) Under the current situation, industrial construction should prioritize: 1. Projects and industries directly related to increasing agricultural production, such as agricultural water conservancy, agricultural tool manufacturing, and fertilizers. 2. Manufacturing industries for daily necessities for the people's livelihood. 3. Transportation, public works, power, and fuel industries that coordinate with the above two items. (3) For production and construction projects that meet the above conditions, the government's funding and financial institutions' loans should not use inflation as an excuse to adopt the past austerity policies. 1. In areas where military operations are still ongoing, efforts should be made to protect them, treating economic strongholds with the same importance as military strongholds. 2. The recovered areas should immediately restore their economies. 3. Areas not affected by military operations should do their best to develop their economies. During the discussions in the meeting today, the economic strongholds and military strongholds were still carefully researched. The original wording was to treat economic strongholds as military strongholds, but it has now been changed to "equal importance."</p>
<p>Also: The Institute of Engineers believes that there is a need to revise the current auditing system. This was specifically raised in the special discussion on "Review of Obstacles Imposed by the Current System on Construction Undertakings" before, and it was specifically raised again on the 5th. The conclusions of the case are noted as follows: (1) Change from pre-audit to post-audit. Chairman Chiang had ordered this to be done in November 1945 and March 1946, and the Executive Yuan had also discussed implementation methods in May of this year, so the government should be urged to implement it as soon as possible. (2) In the future, when the government creates management regulations related to economic construction undertakings, it should invite various technical experts with experience to participate in the work, so that it is in line with reality.</p>

<h3>Our Country's Stance on the Greek Issue Reaffirmed by Chiang Tingfu; The U.S. is Willing to Consider the Compromise Proposal Submitted by Belgium, but Conditioned on South, Bulgaria, and Albania Implementing the UN General Assembly's Recommendations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Chinese representative Chiang Tingfu strongly defended the United States in the UN Political Committee today, requesting the General Assembly to stop the Soviet Union's satellite states' violence on the Greek border. Chiang directly accused South, Bulgaria, and Albania of being responsible for the recent months of violence on the Greek border, stating that such actions had no justification. If it is said that since Britain is aiding the Greek government, Greece's neighboring countries can provide aid to the opposition, this statement is unacceptable to us. If it is recognized, it will inevitably lead to international anarchy. The Soviet Union and its Balkan satellite states have opposed the Security Council's intervention. In fact, any country that claims to be honest should not oppose international investigation and observation. If the Security Council wants to carry out its mission, it must be able to dispatch observers to any location in the world where peace is threatened. If the Security Council does not have this power, it will inevitably degenerate into a mere debating society, and the entire mechanism of peace will collapse. China has no direct interests in Greece, but because this issue is very important to the future of peace, it supports the U.S. resolution requesting South, Bulgaria, and Albania to stop and not provide further aid to the Greek guerrillas.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 4th] If South, Bulgaria, and Albania, under Soviet support, accept the large-scale border patrol recommended by the United Nations Committee, the United States will relax its harsh proposals for resolving the Balkan dispute. This condition of the United States was proposed by U.S. representative Johnson in the UN Political Committee today. According to Johnson, if the three Balkan countries agree to this, the United States is willing to accept the compromise proposal submitted by Belgian Prime Minister Spaak on the 3rd. According to this compromise proposal, the United States will no longer directly condemn South, Bulgaria, and Albania for their responsibility for the Greek civil war in the General Assembly. Spaak's suggestion will enable the United States to implement its previous proposal in the Security Council, namely, to establish a semi-permanent United Nations border surveillance to monitor the northern border area of Greece. The debate on the Greek issue is scheduled to continue on Monday.</p>
<h3>International Conference on Freedom of the Press: We Oppose the Participation of Outer Mongolia; The Soviet Representative Criticizes Mrs. Roosevelt's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 4th] Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun today opposed the Soviet Union's request for Outer Mongolia to participate in the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press and be allowed to vote in the UN Social Committee. Zhang said that this invitation had been repeatedly rejected by the Economic and Social Council, and that "Outer Mongolia is by no means a peace-loving country that can stand among other United Nations countries." Outer Mongolia is clearly not qualified to participate in the Conference on Freedom of the Press.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union spoke up for Outer Mongolia, it stated that Outer Mongolia had a long history of cooperation with the Soviet Union. Zhang said, "I am delighted that the Soviet Union has so clearly demonstrated the cooperation between Outer Mongolia and the Red Army. I am even more delighted that the Soviet Union has clearly declared that Outer Mongolia is building a new army. This new army has shown its power to neighboring countries in recent weeks. Is this what is meant by Outer Mongolia being peace-loving?" Soviet representative Zorin accused Mrs. Roosevelt of using frivolous and near-reactionary remarks to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal for the United Nations to punish American "merchants of war." Zorin's speech lasted an hour, forcefully stating that Mrs. Roosevelt's views were not in line with the facts. "Why does Mrs. Roosevelt oppose every word in the agenda opposing fascism to protect freedom of the press? Why do we not openly propose the true goal of combating all forms of fascism?" Zorin reiterated his condemnation of American newspapers being manipulated by monopolistic enterprises, and "disregarding social issues." China, Britain, and France echoed the United States in opposing the Soviet Union's proposal, while Indian representative Bannerji agreed that "the abuses of newspapers should be prevented," but warned that achieving this goal should be conditional on not harming the fundamental right to freedom of the press.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt Broadcasts the Meaning of Freedom of the Press</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 4th] Philippine Brigadier General Romulo and Mrs. Roosevelt will broadcast the meaning of freedom of the press at noon on the 5th. Mrs. Roosevelt will broadcast first, and then ask Romulo about issues related to freedom of the press and war-mongering raised by the Soviet Union in the United Nations General Assembly. According to reports, Luo has proposed a motion requesting the General Assembly to convene a conference on freedom of the press in Geneva next year.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] Mrs. Roosevelt pointed out in her daily column today that the Soviet Union is using Hitler's propaganda tactics. She also said that the Soviet Union's propaganda technique is a "technique of lying." The publication of this article coincided with the time of her debate with the Soviet Union in the General Assembly on the meaning of freedom of the press.</p>
<h3>Disappointing</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] The Second United Nations General Assembly has been in session for three weeks, and representatives are generally disappointed with the slow progress of the major issues listed on the agenda, and that the General Assembly may exceed its original six-week deadline. Some officials even predict that the General Assembly may not have ended when the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference is convened in London at the end of November. Since the opening of this General Assembly, there have been 16 plenary sessions and over 70 meetings of various committees and subcommittees, but except for procedural matters, no committee has passed a resolution, and the plenary session has not even completed the work of electing members of the Security Council and the Trusteeship Council. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: 1. Representatives are still trying to make propaganda speeches. 2. Since the election of members of the Security Council and other institutions, directors, and committee members has not been completed, representatives want to use the debate to draw attention to their country. 3. The bloc voting system is the reason for the difficult birth of members of the Security Council and the Trusteeship Council. 4. Small countries are still afraid to rashly adopt a pro-American or pro-Soviet stance on fundamental issues. This is probably due to the excessive mutual attacks by the United States and the Soviet Union at the beginning of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Advocates Expanding the Scope of Membership of the Far East Economic Commission</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] The Soviet Union has submitted a resolution in the UN Economic Committee requesting to expand the membership qualifications of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The resolution stated that the original membership qualifications of the committee should be expanded to include all other United Nations member states in the Far East and Asia, and non-self-governing territories in the region should also be invited to participate in the work in a consultative capacity.</p>
<h3>The Iranian Government Obtains a Vote of Confidence</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tehran, 5th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultana obtained a delayed vote of confidence in a secret parliamentary session on the 5th, after being allowed to explain the entire process of the Soviet-Iranian oil negotiations. The opposition party attacked Sultana's actions over the past nineteen months, arguing that they were illegal because they had not been authorized by Parliament. When the vote of confidence was taken, 93 votes supported the government, 12 voted against, and 11 abstained. The national ballots were blank. When the final results were announced, Sultana's supporters shouted "A good omen" repeatedly.</p>
<h3>The Disappearance of Eight Soviet Technicians in the United States is Not Accurate</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The previous false report that eight Soviet technicians who were studying American production methods in Michigan had disappeared is inaccurate. Immigration Commissioner Miller said that the matter was purely a "misunderstanding" and that the Immigration Bureau knew exactly where the eight technicians were.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops Begin to Withdraw from Italy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 4th] The U.S. Mediterranean Command announced today that the U.S. occupation forces will begin withdrawing from Italy next Monday. The last batch, except for a small number of cleanup units, will depart on December 2. The Italian peace treaty was approved on September 15, and the occupation forces should withdraw from Italy within 90 days.</p>
<h3>The Left-Wing Motion of No Confidence is Rejected; The Italian Government's Position is Stable; The Foreign Minister Announces that the U.S. Agrees to Give Up the Italian Warships Allotted for Reparations</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 4th] The motion of no confidence in the non-Communist government led by Prime Minister Gasperi, proposed by Left-Wing Socialist Party leader Nanni, was rejected by the Italian Constituent Assembly by a vote of 271 to 179. Communist Party leader Togliatti immediately withdrew his motion of no confidence. In June, the Constituent Assembly passed a vote of confidence in Gasperi by a difference of 43 votes. The difference on the 4th was 93 votes, more than double. With Nanni failing and Togliatti withdrawing his motion, the attempts by the extreme left to join the government have failed.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 4th] Foreign Minister Sforza announced to the Constituent Assembly today that the United States has agreed to give up the Italian fleet allotted under reparations. The entire place cheered unanimously, and even the Communist Party members had to join in. Sforza continued that the Italian delegation will soon go to the Soviet Union to conduct trade negotiations.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Reshuffle to Be Announced in Days</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Prime Minister Attlee will finalize the final plans for the cabinet reshuffle this weekend, and the new lineup will be announced on Monday or Tuesday of next week. So far, those who will be changed remain a closely guarded secret. Among the various speculations, the most valuable ones are as follows: Defence Minister Alexander is the most likely to leave the cabinet. His participation in the cabinet is mostly due to his political leadership in the economic cooperation movement. He is 62 years old, and in terms of age, it is appropriate for him to join the House of Lords. Commonwealth Relations Secretary Lord Addison is 78 years old and has repeatedly expressed his willingness to retire, so his departure from the cabinet in this reshuffle is inevitable. Fuel Minister Shinwell is likely to leave the cabinet due to last winter's fuel crisis and his offense to the middle class who support the government. However, it is said that Shinwell will succeed Addison as Commonwealth Relations Secretary. Supply Minister Wilmot, who is said to be the one who prompted the cabinet's decision to postpone the nationalization of steel, is disliked by the left wing of the Labour Party and is likely to be dismissed. If so, the position may be taken over by Bevin, the current Health Minister who is a leader of the radical faction in the cabinet. However, since Bevin is determined to make the government's housing construction plan a success, he may not want to give up his position as Health Minister. Food Minister Strachey, who handles the most difficult affairs, has surprisingly achieved equal success, so he may be promoted to Defence Minister, which belongs to the inner cabinet.</p>
<h3>Philippine Representative Suggests to the UN General Assembly Launching a New Marshall Plan; Europe and Asia Should Not Be Treated Unfairly</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] Philippine representative Quinto suggested in the UN Economic Committee that another "Marshall Aid Plan" be launched to investigate underdeveloped regions such as Asia. He expressed regret that the report on the Marshall Plan only involved Europe and did not involve underdeveloped regions. Because if there is a report on the amount of dollars needed worldwide, the needs of the world can be understood, and global resources can be systematically planned and distributed. Quinto supported the statement of the Indian representative, believing that more attention should be paid to underdeveloped regions.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Build a Supply Base in East Africa</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The British Army will establish the largest supply base in Africa in recent years this month. The main base will be located in Mombasa, Kenya, East Africa, just below the equator, halfway between Cairo and Cape Town. The construction cost will reach millions of pounds and will take many years. This base will be the main overseas base of the British Army. The British military supplies currently in Egypt and India, as well as the British military supplies in Palestine after the British army withdraws from there, will be moved to this base.</p>
<h3>The British Princess's Wedding Cake, a Luxurious Four-Layer Cake with Complex Designs and Deep Meanings</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The National Confectioners' Association bulletin said that the design of Princess Elizabeth's wedding cake has been approved by the princess. The cake is divided into four layers. The first layer has the badges of the new couple, the Windsor badge, the Borough badge, and the Buckingham Palace pattern; the second layer has the handbag obtained by the princess when she was granted the freedom of the city of Windsor, the princess inspecting troops as the captain of the guards, the Battle of Cape Matapan, various musical symbols, and patterns of various sports; the third layer has a cupid holding a shield with the initials of the new couple, the naval badge of the House of Mountbatten, badges of auxiliary teams and women's teams, and the patterns of the battleship Valiant, drawn by Captain Mountbatten, which participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan; the fourth layer will be the national emblems of the self-governing colonies, namely Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>[United Press, Sydney, 4th] The wedding cake sent by the Australian Country Women's Association to Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten was shipped to London today. The cake is divided into six layers, weighing one hundred and thirty pounds. The bottom layer is decorated with the Australian emblem, and each layer represents a state.</p>
<h3>Churchill Suggests Requesting Money from India and Egypt; The Conservative Party Annual Meeting Announces Its Conclusion</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Brighton, 4th] The Conservative Party Annual Meeting closed here on the evening of the 4th. Amidst the cheers of 5,000 representatives, Churchill demanded that Britain request from India, Egypt, and several other allied countries the expenses for Britain's assistance in defending them from the aggression of Germany, Japan, and Italy. Britain's assistance to other countries during the war resulted in heavy debts, and half of its overseas investments were also sold, so the current economic crisis in Britain is mostly due to this. Britain assisted Egypt, India, and several allied countries in resisting the Axis powers and incurred debts, resulting in the need to pay millions of pounds annually, "Therefore, I think we should raise a counter-claim for assistance, because in fact they are the debtors, not us."</p>
<h3>Wallace Is Scheduled to Go to the Holy Land for Inspection and Will Not Give Public Speeches Abroad</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 4th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace said here that he is scheduled to travel by plane to Palestine on October 17 with Schuyler, the publisher of the "New Republic Magazine" that he edits, to talk with Arab and Jewish groups and to investigate the agricultural resources of the Holy Land. He does not intend to give public speeches abroad, but will publish his findings in his magazine.</p>
<h3>Churchill Is Surrounded; His Beloved Dog Dies</h3>
<p>[United Press, Brighton, England, 4th] Crowds followed and surrounded Churchill all day on Saturday, and Churchill's French poodle dog, which left Churchill's entourage on the Brighton beach, was crushed to death by a bus.</p>
<h3>France's Economic Crisis Is Increasingly Urgent; It Plans to Use All Available Dollars</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] French officials revealed that they are discussing the possibility of using the remaining portion of the U.S. Export-Import Bank and World Bank loans to France to purchase necessary U.S. imports.</p>
<p>Of the $250 million in World Bank loans to France, approximately $40 million remains, and approximately $180 million in Export-Import Bank loans also remain. These funds have been designated for the purchase of materials specifically for construction. French officials are doubtful whether the World Bank will allow the funds to be transferred for "emergency" use, but up to $60 million of the Export-Import Bank loans can be transferred to pay for wheat and coal purchased from the U.S. Other funds for France's "emergency" use include: 1. Approximately $93 million, the value of German plundered gold allocated to France by the Brussels Tripartite Commission. 2. A total of approximately $50 million in various wartime compensation fees paid by the United States; 3. Purchasing dollars from the International Monetary Fund again. In the past, France was able to obtain $25 million in dollars from the Fund in exchange for its reserves. French officials expect that the U.S. Congress will not pass any aid funds before the end of December, and France needs a minimum of $120 million per month, so France needs at least $200 million to pay for urgently needed coal and grain.</p>
<h3>South Korean Right-Wing Youth Groups Hold Large-Scale Demonstrations Demanding That U.S. Troops Continue to Be Stationed in Korea Demonstrators Raise Fierce Anti-Soviet Slogans</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 5th] Approximately 60,000 members of the right-wing Korean Youth Association gathered at the Seoul Stadium on the 5th to oppose the possibility of U.S. troops withdrawing from Korea. The Korean Youth Association is composed of various far-right youth groups, with the largest unit being the Seobuk Youth Association, originally a group of exiled North Korean youths. The demonstrators entered the stadium in orderly rows from various districts of Seoul. U.S. military police were also fully mobilized and ordered to provide full assistance to the Korean police during the dispersal if necessary. The demonstrators held up banners with slogans such as "Down with the Soviet Union" and "Oppose the withdrawal of U.S. troops." According to a report, the U.S. military police have been ordered to use force to suppress any participants who attempt to cause chaos. At least 30 people were arrested in the fighting, and the number of injured is unknown. The demonstration on the 5th was originally scheduled to be held on the 4th, but was postponed by one day due to rain. U.S. military police closely guarded Stikov's residence to prevent accidents similar to those on the 4th.</p>
<h3>Our Consul General in Seoul Departed for the U.S. by Plane Yesterday</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 4th] Liu Yuwan, Chinese Consul General in Korea, is scheduled to fly to Lake Success on a Northwest Airlines plane on the 5th to provide information to the Chinese delegation attending the UN General Assembly to prepare for discussions on the Korean issue.</p>
<h3>The Chinese General Association of Batavia Issues a Strong Appeal: Indonesian Overseas Chinese Suffer Abuse; Memorandum Submitted to the Security Council and Consular Corps</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 4th] The Chinese General Association here, in its main memorandum submitted to the Security Council and the local Consular Corps, dismisses the "internal causes" usually cited by Indonesian Republican leaders for the abuse of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The text and photographs in this document consistently emphasize that Indonesian Overseas Chinese have no political or territorial ambitions.</p>
<p>The memorandum states: Although hundreds of Overseas Chinese have been able to accumulate wealth, it is absurd to say that Overseas Chinese are a generally "wealthy group." This fallacy can be overturned by refuting it with tax statistics. Some Indonesian Republican leaders, unable to distinguish, actually regard the mistakes of a few Overseas Chinese as representative of all Overseas Chinese, and consider Overseas Chinese residing in Allied territories as "not neutral." The memorandum also criticizes the pre-war Dutch economic system, as the Dutch authorities at that time had lowered wages to the minimum to allow exported products to compete in the world market and still generate profits for capitalists and the administration. The existence of this system, coupled with the Indonesian people's own lack of energy and initiative, led to the economic backwardness of the Indonesian people. The memorandum asserts: "It seems unfair to blame the Indonesian predicament on the exploitation of Overseas Chinese." In fact, despite various economic obstacles, such as regulations prohibiting land ownership, Overseas Chinese have been able to make a living mainly through diligence, frugality, and intelligence. The memorandum continues, stating that during the Japanese occupation, Indonesians had ample opportunity to compete economically with Overseas Chinese, and even to seize the economic position of the Overseas Chinese. Although they had assistance from the Japanese side, they ultimately failed. The memorandum concludes by stating that the Overseas Chinese truly do not understand the meaning of the abuse inflicted on Overseas Chinese by the Indonesian Republic with means to confront enemies, both before and after the commencement of the "police action" on July 21st. At the same time, the Indonesian Republic cannot claim to have been completely unaware of this abuse.</p>
<h3>European Communists Establish Anti-American Organization</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] London, 5th (Broadcast): According to news, communist party members from nine European countries, including the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia, held a meeting in Poland earlier this month and passed a resolution advocating uncompromising opposition to American "imperialism." They also decided to establish an organization in the Yugoslav capital to be responsible for guidance.</p>
<h3>Japan Revises Criminal Law; Abolishes Lèse-Majesté and Adultery Crimes</h3>

The so-called lèse-majesté crime was stipulated based on the inviolable right of the Japanese Emperor under the old constitution. The new constitution has removed this provision, so the provision in the criminal law no longer has a basis.</p>

<h3>National Defense Ministry Interprets Whether or Not to Postpone Conscription of Drivers and Others of Private Cars of Various Agencies</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Civil Affairs Bureau previously requested the Ministry of National Defense to interpret whether or not drivers, cooks, handymen of private cars of various agencies, ticket sellers, ticket signers, ticket inspectors, etc. of public transportation agencies should be included in the National Defense Technical Employees, and whether or not conscription should be postponed, in order to facilitate review. The Ministry of National Defense recently replied to the Civil Affairs Bureau with the following interpretation: Drivers of private cars of various agencies who hold driver's licenses may be deemed as specialized technicians, but their service place is not related to national defense industrial departments, which does not comply with Item 5 of the "Scope of Application for Postponement of Conscription for Specialized Technical Employees Related to National Defense Industry" promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Postponement of conscription should not be granted. Cooks in factories only add coal and are considered handymen, not technicians, and postponement of conscription cannot be granted. Ticket sellers, ticket signers, and ticket inspectors of public transportation agencies, although serving in departments related to national defense industry, are only ordinary employees and not irreplaceable specialized technical employees, and should also not be granted postponement of conscription. The reply concluded by saying: In terms of the Conscription Law, postponement of conscription is not appropriate for the aforementioned employees. In terms of conscription of volunteers, this year can be temporarily handled in accordance with the separate measures formulated by Shanghai. The person in charge of the Civil Affairs Bureau added an explanation to the end of this document, stating that the conscription-age men and those applying for exemption or postponement of military service investigated this year are for conscription use next year. Whether or not the city will universally conscript soldiers next year or only conscript volunteers, and whether or not the separate measures formulated by the city will be revised, cannot be determined at present, so whether or not the aforementioned sections can be applied to next year cannot be determined.</p>

<h3>Ten Thousand Mile Long March; Sudden Report of Disappearance; Two Globe-Trotting Small Aircraft Forced to Land in Xiamen After Encountering Storm on Way North</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The two single-wing small training aircraft touring the world flew to the Far East this time. Due to unfavorable weather in Japan, they have been stranded in Hong Kong for three days. At 7:20 AM yesterday morning, they finally took off to come to Shanghai. However, one hour after takeoff, they lost contact with the ground. For a time, rumors were rife in Shanghai aviation circles that the two aircraft had disappeared. The estimated time of arrival in Shanghai was around 3:00 PM, but there was no news at all at the three airports in Shanghai: Longhua, Jiangwan, and Hongqiao. Although the Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration repeatedly inquired with radio stations in various coastal areas, the result was still unknown. At that time, weather reports from various places all stated that the coastal climate was bad, and the wind speed would reach a maximum of 28 miles per hour in the afternoon, and even higher to 60 miles per hour by evening. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, the Civil Aviation Administration telegraphed the U.S. military to send a maritime search team to investigate along the coast, hoping to find something.</p>
<p>Until 9:30 PM, just as radio stations in various places were inquiring with each other, assuming the worst, the Civil Aviation Administration suddenly received a telegram from Xiamen stating that the two aircraft had landed in Xiamen and the people and aircraft were safe. At this point, the mystery of the disappearance was finally broken, but the staff of radio stations in various places had been busy all day because of this.</p>
<p>The two single-wing training aircraft touring the world this time each had one pilot, one named Truman and the other Evans. The only empty seat on the aircraft had to carry a large amount of gasoline, prepared for long-distance flight, so there were no assistants accompanying them. When the two aircraft took off from Hong Kong yesterday morning, they each carried enough gasoline to fly for eighteen hours. When flying into Fujian Province, they were forced to land at the Xiamen airport nearby due to the high-speed headwinds.</p>
<p>Whether the aircraft will continue to fly to Shanghai today will depend on the weather. Their "flight plan" this time may contact Shanghai to coordinate. If the weather improves, the estimated time of arrival in Shanghai today is around 2:20 PM.</p>
<p>The main reason why the aircraft lost contact halfway yesterday was, after investigation, that the wireless device installed on the aircraft was a small wireless station weighing only 26 pounds, produced by the American Bendix factory. Its communication range can reach 80 miles in good conditions, but only 50 miles in bad weather. Therefore, one hour after the aircraft flew out yesterday, the radio stations were unable to contact it.</p>
<h3>Madame Wellington Koo Raises Funds in the United States to Support the Reconstruction Service for the Disabled</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Reconstruction Service for the Disabled, affiliated with the Chinese Vocational Education Society and commissioned by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, was established on June 1st of this year. More than 40 disabled citizens of the city have registered. In addition to the Municipal Health Bureau and various municipal hospitals providing free physical examinations, the service introduces disabled people who can be treated to various municipal hospitals for preferential or free treatment and rehabilitation. The service recently received a letter from Honorary Chairman Madame Wellington Koo from the United States, stating that she has established a special committee in the United States to expand fundraising for the service, intending to use the proceeds to expand the service's operations so that all disabled people in the city have a place to turn to. Madame Koo also said that the work of reconstructing the disabled is still a pioneering effort in our country. She hopes that people in our country who are enthusiastic about social work will provide assistance to enable its operations to develop even further.</p>

<h3>Hou Debang Returns After Negotiating the Recovery of Equipment for Yongli: Seeing the Fearful Reconstruction of Japan from the Needs of Industrial Coal</h3>
<p>[Special Article] Hou Debang, the world-renowned Chinese chemist, recently returned to Tianjin from Japan, and then arrived in Shanghai. In two weeks, he will go to India to design a soda ash plant, and then go to the United States to order new machinery for the Xiang Factory. I paid a visit to him yesterday and talked about his experiences in Japan, which evoked many emotions in him.</p>
<p>His trip to Japan this time was to negotiate the recovery of nitric acid manufacturing equipment that had been dismantled by the Japanese during the war for the Yongli Company. After the Japanese obtained this equipment, they transported it back to their own factories for use. Much of it was damaged, but much was also added. Repeated negotiations with the Allied Headquarters were unsuccessful. The crux of the matter was that the Allied Headquarters insisted that wartime losses must be settled within the compensation items, and the equipment added by the Japanese could not be recovered. The Yongli Company did not agree, believing that a complete settlement of the compensation issue was truly far off, and they could not "wait for a rabbit to run into a tree stump." Hou's efforts in Japan this time made the Allied Headquarters relent, allowing the Yongli Company to be an exception, agreeing that they could recover the parts added by the Japanese. However, the Allied Headquarters still refused to change this principle of return. The equipment, worth $500,000, is currently being packed and will be shipped back to the motherland in three months.</p>
<p>Rapid Industrial Recovery in Japan</p>
<p>Hou took the opportunity to visit Japanese industries, and he was surprised by the speed of recovery. Most industries have already recovered one-third or even one-half of pre-war production. The chemical fertilizer industry is moving the fastest and will soon be equal to pre-war levels. Allied countries are surpassing pre-war levels. In general, except for heavy industries, industrial recovery is very fast. We can use industrial coal as a measure to see the fearful reconstruction of Japan. They now produce 2 million tons of coal per month, and the national goal is 30 million tons, but due to the rapid recovery of industry, coal is not enough to meet needs. The Japanese are working hard across the country, and they are doing so in an organized and policy-driven way. Their officials and people are cooperating from top to bottom, and their style is consistent.</p>
<p>United States is Magnanimous on Reparations</p>
<p>I reminded him that he had been very pessimistic about reparations in his conversation with reporters in Tianjin. He smiled and denied it: "This is the truth." He believes that early dismantling is guaranteed, but the allocation time will be extended to a year and a half. What our country can be divided into is 18,000 pieces of scattered machinery, not complete sets of factory equipment. The quality of the reparations machinery is still good, and he hopes that the government can allocate it to private factories. As for total reparations, he believes it is unreliable, because the American point of view dominates everything. US Inspector Stryker's background is American commercial interests. They hope that Japan will recover as soon as possible and trade with the United States on a large scale, so they strongly advocate magnanimity on the reparations issue, but they have not considered how to control Japan to prevent it from becoming an aggressive force in the Far East.</p>
<p>Best to be Self-Sufficient</p>
<p>The future industrial level of Japan, the Far Eastern Commission proposed the standard of 1931 to 1934, but it has not yet been passed. Hou said: "I advocate using 1930 as the standard, which was the year before Japan launched its invasion of China. At the same time, Japan was in a recession that year. In 1934, Japan's production had been raised very high due to military needs."</p>
<p>This industrialist holds a special view on boycotting Japanese goods. He said: "In the future, it will be impossible to distinguish between Japanese and American goods. The United States supplies raw cotton to Japan and collects its finished yarn and cloth, which are sold to various countries under the name of American goods. Therefore, a rigid boycott of Japanese goods is simply impossible. From China's standpoint, it is best to be self-sufficient in production, otherwise, when doing economic calculations, choose to buy what is cheap and cost-effective, regardless of India or Japan, are China's strong competitors, because the inspection volume of Indian yarn and cloth is currently the first in Asia!"</p>
<h3>Woman Falsely Claims Kidnapping Out of Desperation; Insurance Agent Sends Strange Letter Claiming He's Willing to Be Killed</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the 24th of last month, the city police department's detective division received a kidnapping report. The informant was a Mrs. Hu, a young woman from Jiangsu province, who stated that her live-in boyfriend, He Yucheng, an insurance agent in his twenties from Ningbo, had brought six million yuan in cash from Suzhou to Shanghai to purchase ink and paper. However, he was allegedly abducted by armed men as soon as he arrived at the North Station, who then demanded a ransom of 100 million yuan. He, lacking such wealth, supposedly wrote to Mrs. Hu, saying he was willing to be killed. Police Chief Li, seeing the seriousness of Mrs. Hu's account, immediately launched an investigation and discovered two suspicious points:</p>
<p>According to normal circumstances, a hostage held in a bandit's den, sending out a desperate plea, would never express a willingness to be killed.</p>
<p>After observing the situation from all sides, He was not a wealthy man, and while his disappearance was possible, it was unlikely he was kidnapped. Therefore, Mrs. Hu was questioned again about whether He had any relatives in Shanghai. She stated that he had an older sister, He Li, living at No. 6, Tongxing Lane, Bansongguo Road, in the southern part of the city. Section Chief Zhu Mengwei was dispatched with officers Ma Pei and Mu to investigate at the address. Her brother-in-law, Li Furong, 48, denied that He had come to Shanghai. However, the room contained many items He had brought with him to Shanghai, which Mrs. Hu identified on the spot, realizing He's deliberate plan to sever the relationship and to make her give up hope by faking a kidnapping. Fearing there might be other aspects to the case, Section Chief Zhu took Li Yanrong and Li Genqing, father and son, to the station for questioning while also issuing a warrant for He Yucheng, who falsely claimed to have been kidnapped, to be brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Dr. Ding Wenyan Is Invited to Broadcast "The Path Young People Should Take" Must Abide by the Law and Be a Model for the People to Enjoy Democratic Freedom and Happiness</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held its 27th special Sunday broadcast at the Shanghai Radio Station yesterday, inviting Dr. Ding Wenyan, President of National Tongji University, to broadcast "The Path Young People Should Take." The essence of his speech is recorded below: "After eight years of war, all construction in China has been severely damaged. After the victory, the country suffered chaos again, which severely hindered the work of reconstruction. Young students living in this turbulent era cannot avoid the pain of being at a loss and aimless. Therefore, the question of 'the path of young people,' although a cliché, is particularly relevant and needed when raised at this time and place.</p>
<p>[Picture of Dr. Ding Wenyan broadcasting (taken by this newspaper)]</p>
<p>China is now entering an era of democracy and constitutionalism. Young students are often misled by communist propaganda, believing the Communist Party to be a democratic party. The Communist Party also advocates "New Democracy," but the reality is quite different. The Communist Party is an extremely authoritarian and dictatorial party. In areas occupied by the communists, there is no freedom or democracy. Therefore, we believe that the government's general mobilization movement and the policy of suppressing bandits and building the country are extremely correct. We should guide young people to support this policy to realize democracy and constitutionalism.</p>
<p>If young students want to enjoy democratic freedom, an important prerequisite is to have a spirit of abiding by the law. Compared with European and American countries, China lags behind in everything. However, in terms of law, it is in no way inferior to European and American countries. China has a complete code of laws. If the people of the country can abide by the law and value discipline, Chinese society will surely get on the right track. Unfortunately, the intellectual level of most Chinese people does not meet the standards, so even with complete laws, lawbreakers are still everywhere. Young students must be able to be a model for the general public in this regard, using the spirit of abiding by the law to influence the general public and create a good atmosphere. Only then, after leaving school, can they lead the public to transform society.</p>
<p>The basic principle of abiding by laws and regulations is to cultivate moral concepts, develop good habits, emphasize courtesy, and maintain order, so that abiding by the law and valuing discipline will not become empty slogans. Every young person must be able to practice it personally. Recently, young students have become arrogant, violating laws and regulations, so that the atmosphere for academic research is becoming weaker. This is truly an educational crisis in modern China. Having served in the education field for a long time, I feel concerned about this phenomenon and dare not help but loudly call on people in the education field and young students to awaken. At this time, the only way to salvage the educational crisis is for young students to recognize the path they should take and to understand that only those who can abide by the law can enjoy the happiness of democratic freedom. At this time of social disorder, young people must be able to act as role models for the public by abiding by the law and valuing discipline, further cultivating a pure academic atmosphere, and strengthening academic research. In school, they should be good students; in society, they can become good citizens. As China enters a new era of democratic constitutionalism, it is hoped that young people can embark on the path of abiding by the law and work together to build a new China."</p>

<h3>The Power of the Northeast: Three Major Power Generation Bases – Jingpo Lake Isolated in the Remote Frontier, Xiaofengman Enshrouded in Gunsmoke, Shuifeng in a Delicate State</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangxun, 2nd Day of the Solar Calendar] The Three Gorges hydroelectric project on the Yangtze River has been halted, and the Yellow River hydroelectric project is even more uncertain as to when it will be realized. At a time when we are unable to harness the power bestowed upon us by nature, everyone's longing for the hydroelectric power industry in the Northeast has intensified.</p>
<p>While the Northeast's water resources still await gradual development in terms of navigation and irrigation, the "Shuifeng," "Xiaofengman," and "Jingpo Lake" hydroelectric power projects have already achieved a good scale in terms of hydropower utilization and are known both domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>These three power generation bases are known internationally, but they also carry the flavors of sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness. Jingpo Lake is isolated in the northern frontier, its waters caught in a delicate relationship between China, Korea, and the Soviet Union. Xiaofengman, furthermore, is enshrouded in gunsmoke, unable to unleash its full power.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Northeast, the light of the Northeast, the power of the Northeast, and the concern of the entire nation are all focused on these three hydroelectric power generation bases in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Jilin, Xiaofengman, is the only one of these three hydroelectric power bases located in a recovered area. It was originally a small village, half rustic and half dawn.</p>
<p>Located in the upper reaches of the Second Songhua River, 24 kilometers from Yongji, it is the site of the largest hydroelectric power plant on the Second Songhua River within the Northeast region. The Second Songhua River originates in the Changbai Mountains on the Sino-Korean border, flowing through deep canyons and towering mountains, winding and twisting. Upon reaching Fengman, it suddenly opens up, forming a large abyss, before flowing north into the plains. Fengman is located at the point where the river's course changes.</p>
<p>The right bank is called Monkey Ridge, which stretches along the river, with an elevation of 900 meters, and a portion rising as high as 700 meters above the river surface. The left bank is the Laga Tower, a branch of the Motian Ridge, with a height of 770 meters, approaching the river flow. It stands opposite Monkey Ridge, forming a natural gateway.</p>
<p>A concrete gravity dam is built across the river at the gateway, cutting off the river flow and creating the world's fourth-largest artificial lake. Today, the renowned Xiaofengman Power Plant utilizes this</p>
<p>artificial lake water</p>
<p>'s head and volume to generate abundant and inexpensive electricity.</p>
<p>Spectacular Xiaofengman Hydroelectric Dam (Northeast News Agency Photo)</p>
<p>The original plan was to install eight generators with a total installed capacity of 560,000 kilowatts, a large output of 480,000 kilowatts, and a potential of reaching 2.6 billion KWH. This massive amount of electricity would be used to develop industries throughout the Northeast and provide lighting.</p>
<p>The power distribution plan at the time was roughly as follows: 120,000 kilowatts would be transmitted to the Jilin area for the exploitation of calcium carbide mines (annual production of approximately 300,000 tons), timber harvesting, as well as supplying electricity for the paper industry, synthetic petroleum, and coal mines.</p>
<p>240,000 kilowatts would be transmitted to the Fushun area, supplying power for coal mining in Fushun, Xi'an, and Liaoyang, as well as for the exploration and development of coal and iron in the eastern border region and near the Changbai Mountains, the manufacturing of light metals such as lead and magnesium, and the power needed for heavy industries such as metallurgy and steelmaking in Anshan.</p>
<p>Another 120,000 kilowatts would be transmitted to Changchun and Harbin, supplying electricity for small and medium-sized industries, as well as general lighting. However, the transmission capacity of one of the two circuits was only half of the original plan.</p>
<p>On August 20th, Soviet troops entered, and on September 20th, construction was dismantled, leaving only two of the original eight water turbine generators.</p>
<p>Existing Equipment</p>
<p>There are only two machines remaining, barely functioning. With a maximum capacity of 70,000 KVA per machine, the total is only 140,000 KVA. The highest power generation previously reached 134,000 kilowatts. Restoring Fengman is a prerequisite for solving the Northeast's electricity problem and promoting the resumption of industrial and mining operations in the Northeast. It is also a key to the Northeast's current economic reconstruction.</p>
<p>Xiaofengman, via the Meihekou-Shuanggqian Road, mostly fell into the hands of bandit forces this summer. This high-voltage line, which can transmit 70,000 to 80,000 kilowatts, was cut off, causing a major electricity shortage in Liaoning. To solve the serious electricity problem in Liaoyang and Shuanggqian, the electricity bureau made various efforts to obtain 120,000 kilowatts of electricity from thermal power generation in Fushun and other places. The industrial and mining operations and lighting electricity in Liaoning and Shuanggqian were largely resolved. Now, with the transmission of over 4,000 kilowatts of electricity from Xiaofengman along the China Chang Railway, the situation may improve somewhat.</p>
<p>Since the Beipiao power plant malfunctioned, the electricity supply for industry and mining in southern Liaoning has been entirely dependent on the 8,000 to 11,000 kilowatts generated by the Jinxi Petroleum Company. In the past, the Japanese relied primarily on hydroelectric power, with thermal power playing a supplementary role. Now, it is truly indescribable.</p>
<p>The construction of the Jingpo Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant was one of the five-year industrial development plans of the puppet Manchuria. It was predicted that if the Mudanjiang River system could be</p>
<p>fully utilized,</p>
<p>300,000 kilowatts of electricity could be generated. The Jingpo Lake Power Plant is the first step in utilizing the hydropower of the Mudanjiang River.</p>
<p>Construction began in March of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), and after three years, power generation began on August 25th of the 31st year (1942). It is approximately 360 kilometers upstream from the confluence of the two rivers in the Northeast, in Abao Village, Dongjingcheng, Ning'an County. The power plant utilizes the water storage and tunnels of Jingpo Lake throughout the four seasons, obtaining a head of 57 meters. The lake's water area is approximately one-sixth of the artificial lake of Xiaofengman. When the large lake surface freezes, the elevation is 350 meters. During the summer when the water rises, it only increases by about two meters. The lake is approximately 42,000 meters long, and the width varies from 5,000 to 43,000 meters, with a perimeter of 180,000 meters. The deepest part of the lake reaches 50 meters. The famous Diaoshuilou Waterfall in Dongjingcheng is 13 meters high, and the waterfall pit is horseshoe-shaped, with a water depth of approximately 30 meters. Geologically, Jingpo Lake was formed when the lava erupted from the mountains in the west during the geological age, blocking the Mudanjiang River, forming a volcanic natural dam.</p>
<p>The local temperature reaches a maximum of 33 degrees Celsius and a minimum of minus 40 degrees Celsius, with a temperature difference of 73 degrees Celsius. During the four winter months, the lake surface freezes to a thickness of more than three feet. The rainfall during the three summer months of July, August, and September accounts for 70% of the annual rainfall.</p>
<p>Power Generation Project</p>
<p>At the northern end of Jingpo Lake, an intake is set up 18 meters below the water surface, and a circular tunnel, 3,003 meters long, is excavated. This tunnel has a diameter of 5.4 meters and leads north to a point close to the main stream of the Mudanjiang River, connecting to a surge tank. From here, two penstocks, approximately 220 meters long and with an average diameter of 2.3 meters, branch off and lead into the water turbines.</p>
<p>The used water is still discharged into the Mudanjiang River. Inside the power plant, the water forms an umbrella shape, creating a fantastical and magnificent scene that is captivating. After the victory, the power plant was controlled by bandit forces. Because it is far in the cold north, everything is in a state of "unknown situation."</p>
<p>The Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant is located in Shuifengdong, Gugokmyeon, Sakju County, North Pyongan Province, Korea. A gravity concrete dam is built across the main stream of the Yalu River from Shuifengdong to Bijiadzi, Kuandian County, Andong Province. It is 10.4 meters high, and the full water level elevation is 122.5 meters, benefiting counties such as Kuandian, Huanren, and Jian'an, as well as counties such as Sakju, Changseong, Pyokdong, Chosan, and Wiwon in Korea.</p>
<p>The Yalu River is the border river between China and Korea. In April of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the puppet Manchuria and Korea exchanged a joint operation agreement for Yalu River hydroelectric power generation. Manchuria and Korea each invested 50 million yuan, organizing the "Joseon Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Co., Ltd." and the "Manzhou Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Co., Ltd." The electricity generated after development was equally divided between Manchuria and Korea.</p>
<p>The entire hydroelectric power plan starts from 17 kilometers upstream of Sinuiju, Korea, on the main stream of the Yalu River and extends to 480 kilometers upstream of Sinuiju. In this middle section, a total of</p>
<p>seven sluice gates</p>
<p>are built, with a total water storage area of 45,535 square kilometers and a total water storage capacity of 20.4 billion cubic meters.</p>
<p>The Yalu River Shuifeng Hydroelectric Power Project began construction in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and a portion was completed and began generating electricity in August of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941). It was fully completed in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943). It is the largest hydroelectric power project in East Asia.</p>
<p>One-half of the electricity generated by the Yalu River Shuifeng Power Plant should be transmitted to the Northeast region. At that time, "Manchukuo Electric" built two 220KV ultra-high-voltage transmission lines, one from Shuifeng to Anshan and one from Shuifeng via Andong to Dalian.</p>
<p>The Shuifeng power source was jointly used by China and Korea and should not have been a problem. However, this was not the case. The power plant is on Korean soil on the opposite bank of the river, and the dam is on our bank. After the recovery of the Northeast, the Andong area still had electricity. After the recovery of Anshan, a city of steel smelting, the Shuifeng direct line to Anshan was severely damaged. After the recovery of Andong, the electricity in Andong had to be exchanged for grain by the people. Andong is not a rice-producing area, so everyone encountered considerable difficulties.</p>
<p>Last winter, our military authorities in Andong sent personnel across the river to meet with the Soviet military authorities in North Korea. As a result of the negotiations, it was determined that our side</p>
<p>was responsible for dam protection,</p>
<p>and the issues of property rights and power supply would be studied. What is the situation in Andong now? Because the National Army withdrew this summer, it is impossible to know. Although the damaged sections of the Anshan to Shuifeng line have been repaired, where is the electricity?</p>
<p>The Northeast Electricity Bureau of the Resources Commission sent a letter to the North Korean Electricity Bureau in January of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), stating that the joint operation agreement for the Yalu River power generation project signed by "Manchukuo" and Korea on April 21st of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) remained valid - the original contract was valid for 35 years, and clarifying the issues of property rights and power supply. The response received was waiting!</p>
<p>According to a survey conducted by the Japanese in the past, in addition to Fengman, Shuifeng, and Jingpo Lake, there are more than 50 places in the Northeast region with permanent locations suitable for power generation along the Yalu, Songhua, Liao, Tumen, Longjiang, and other river systems, with a total power generation capacity of over 7 million kilowatts.</p>
<p>Hydroelectric power generation has its unique advantages in both power production and consumption. As long as the political situation is stable and the government develops it in a planned manner, the electrification and industrialization of the entire Northeast will be the day when the Northeast assumes the responsibility of the "general factory" for the national economic construction!

<h3>Liu, Acting Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, Discusses the Reasons for the Recent Rise in Yarn and Cloth Prices, Stating That Increased Production Will Inevitably Lead to Normalization and Hoping That Manufacturers Will Cooperate in Implementing Joint Distribution</h3>
<p>Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, recently spoke to reporters about the continuous rise in yarn and cloth prices and the issue of joint yarn distribution, stating that the main reason for the recent increase in cotton yarn prices is the shortage of electricity and fuel, which has greatly affected production. A month ago, each yarn factory only operated for an average of four days a week. If they were to operate fully for the remaining three days, the production of yarn and cloth could be increased by more than one-third. Mr. Liu continued, "The government is paying close attention to this and is determined to find ways to save unnecessary electricity and transfer it to production enterprises. The Municipal Council has also passed a resolution on this matter, and the government is assisting yarn factories in generating their own electricity. The required 3,000 tons of fuel (coal) have also been fully supplied as needed. Therefore, in the future, all existing yarn spindles in yarn factories can be put into operation, and production will be greatly increased." According to his observation, the current rise in yarn and cloth prices is a temporary phenomenon. In the future, as production increases, supply and demand will inevitably tend to normalize. Regarding joint distribution, Acting Chairman Liu stated, "Before implementation, we will first conduct yarn inventory registration. The registration methods are being reviewed by a subcommittee and will be implemented after being approved by the committee." According to Mr. Liu's explanation, joint yarn distribution and yarn inventory registration are established government policies. However, in order to obtain the cooperation of manufacturers and jointly promote this policy, we are determined to solicit opinions from manufacturers in order to ensure smooth implementation.</p>
<h3>The Textile Adjustment Committee Supervises Factories to Purchase Domestic Cotton and Plans to Formulate Unified Purchase Methods, Establishing Price Negotiation Committees in Various Cotton-Producing Areas</h3>
<p>The Textile Adjustment Committee has decided to start cotton registration today. All yarn factories or cotton merchants in the city must register their inventory to prevent hoarding and speculation. Those who fail to register before the 15th of this month will be punished according to law once discovered. The registration of yarn and cloth inventory has also been decided in principle and will be announced and implemented once detailed methods are determined. In the future, non-industry merchants will be strictly prohibited from storing or selling cotton yarn, cloth, and other goods, as well as warehouse receipts. Violators will be punished according to law. As new cotton has been listed in various places, the committee has formulated unified purchase methods. State-owned and private yarn factories will be supervised by the committee to purchase domestic cotton, organizing institutions and handling it by region and group in accordance with regulations. The committee will collect opinions from all parties and submit them to the ministry for record before implementation. Regarding the purchase price of domestic cotton, cotton price negotiation committees will be established in important cotton-producing areas, jointly organized by local government representatives, cotton farmer groups, cotton industry associations, and representatives of the committee. The price will be determined through consultation, taking into account the cotton production cost, plus reasonable profits, market cotton prices, and general price levels. The committee will determine the maximum purchase amount for each yarn factory based on its production capacity. If the limit is exceeded, the excess portion should be resold to the committee at the original price for necessary adjustment and distribution. Factories requiring funds to purchase cotton can apply to the committee, which will introduce them to the competent financial institutions for financing. However, the cotton used for financing must be manufactured in accordance with the committee's specified cotton yarn standards. In order to promote cotton seed improvement and improve yarn and cloth quality, and in order to trace the source of raw cotton, the committee may purchase high-quality American varieties for distribution to factories that imitate and produce fine yarn. Each factory's purchase quantity, unit price, and amount should be reported to the committee on a ten-day basis for verification.</p>

<h3>Prices Soar, Guangzhou Market in Chaos</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Yanzhou 5th Telegram] The Hong Kong dollar has soared rapidly here in recent days. Yesterday, it opened at 9,830 and soared throughout the day, closing at 10,400. This morning, it opened at 10,300 yuan, a 50% increase in the past twenty days. Other prices have also risen accordingly, and the market is extremely chaotic. Rice prices have also increased by 10,000 yuan in two days.</p>
<h3>Thirty-Five Silver Shops in Guangzhou Request Registration Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 5th Telegram] The Guangzhou Money and Silver Industry Association recently applied to the Ministry of Finance for the registration of its fifty-six member silver shops. Only twenty-one have been approved, and the remaining thirty-five have been denied registration and ordered to cease operations within two months. The silver industry has been sending representatives to the provincial and municipal authorities for several days to appeal, requesting that they forward a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to revoke the decision. They have also decided to send representatives such as Guan Nengchuang to Beijing to appeal.</p>
<h3>300,000 Yards of Japanese Woolen Fabric Still Stored in Warehouses in This City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to people in the woolen textile industry, "The 300,000 yards of woolen fabric obtained by the China Trust Bureau through barter trade with Japan were previously recommended by the textile industry to the authorities for export, but they are still stored in warehouses in this city. It is reported that Southeast Asia does not need woolen fabric due to the climate, and negotiations with the Near East and Middle East are still pending. This 300,000 yards of woolen fabric was originally surplus material from Japan. There were initially 700,000 yards, but after a portion was used by the United States, this amount remained. The British originally planned to transport it to Hong Kong and import it into our country at an opportune time, but this was prevented after our strong efforts. The quality of the woolen fabric is very good, and the current selling price per yard is probably over 700,000 yuan. Because it has stripes, it is not suitable for military use, but it is very suitable for allocation to public educators."</p>
<h3>Italy Invites Our Country to Participate in the World Commodity Exhibition, to Be Held in Milan Next April</h3>
<p>The World Commodity Exhibition, organized by the Italian Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is the only organization in the country to promote the prosperity of commercial markets and develop foreign trade. The first post-war exhibition was held by the association in July of this year, with the participation of as many as forty-four countries. It is now known that the second exhibition of the association has been scheduled for April next year, still to be held in the commercial center of Milan. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is actively carrying out preparations and will expand its invitation to countries around the world to participate. Our country will also be invited. It is reported that the invitation letter has been sent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to our ambassador to Italy, who will forward it to the relevant authorities of our government to solicit preparations from domestic manufacturers to go abroad and participate in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>Goods Arriving Without Import Licenses Valued at Approximately 70 Million US Dollars, Concerned Individuals Express Two Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The quantity of goods arriving without import licenses has not yet been determined, but according to relevant individuals, "The goods that are permitted to be imported are worth approximately 40 million US dollars, and the total value, including limited import goods, is approximately 70 million US dollars. Rumors of over 100 million US dollars probably include a portion of automobiles. Regarding the disposal of this batch of materials, the idea of official price acquisition has become a thing of the past. Except for luxury goods, the rest will be replaced by taxes instead of fines. It is hoped that the government can classify the nature of the goods and then handle them separately, giving appropriate preferential treatment to production tools and raw materials."</p>
<p>Another business leader said, "I believe that the government can, in principle, allow this batch of goods because they are, after all, the property of Chinese people. However, due to the drastic changes in prices in recent months, merchants with these materials have already made countless profits. As prices are still fluctuating, merchants are likely to hoard them and not sell them even after obtaining import licenses. Therefore, after allowing imports, the government should force merchants to sell this batch of materials immediately to consumer organizations, such as raw materials being sold to factories and newsprint being sold to newspapers. This will have a good impact on production and price stability."</p>
<h3>National Bank Auditing Office Announces Statistics on Domestic Remittances for August</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to statistics on the total amount of domestic remittances for August by various banks and firms in the city, released by the Auditing Office of the Central Bank, the total amount of remittances received was 1,730,241,455,234.06 yuan.

<h3>Limited Supply and High Demand Drive Up Fresh Meat Prices</h3>
<p>The price of meat in this city has risen sharply in recent days. Economic police officers from the police station have been ordered to investigate various vegetable markets and crack down on illegal activities at any time. It is reported that the biggest reasons for the rise in meat prices are: The severe reduction in pig production due to the floods in northern Jiangsu; Difficult transportation and increased railway freight rates, which have increased costs; Cooler weather, which has led to an increase in the number of people eating meat and a corresponding increase in demand. This has created the current price surge.</p>
<h3>The Announcement of the Thawing of Hong Kong-Guangdong "Through-Heaven Permits" Affects the Rise in Raw Material Prices in This City, and Import and Export Industries Hope for the Opening of Goods Imported Without Permits</h3>
<p>Hong Kong-Guangdong trade has been in a state of extreme decline since the Guangdong-Kowloon Customs announced the freezing of "Through-Heaven Permits" on September 22. Because the Kowloon Customs issued the cancellation order too hastily, merchants were unable to prepare in time. It is reported that materials worth more than one million Hong Kong dollars have been declared but have not been able to be taxed and imported into the country. The face value of "Through-Heaven Permits" still in the hands of merchants but not yet declared also exceeds three million Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, Hong Kong-Guangdong merchants have suffered excessive losses and have petitioned the Hong Kong Tax Office and the Kowloon Customs. According to a source from the import and export industry in this city, the Kowloon Customs, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, announced on the 2nd of this month that the "Through-Heaven Permits" issued before September 22 would be restored to use. After the announcement of this news, the market price of "Through-Heaven Permits" in Hong Kong soared from 35% to 57%. As for "Through-Heaven Permits" issued after September 22, because they are still subject to various restrictions on the face value and types of goods, no one is interested in them. At the same time, the prices of industrial raw materials in Hong Kong have also risen with the thawing of "Through-Heaven Permits". For example, the market price of industrial raw material "Moon Brand Caustic Soda" was 890 Hong Kong dollars on the morning of the 2nd, but it rose to 920 Hong Kong dollars in the afternoon. British Caustic Soda also rose from 840 Hong Kong dollars to 870 Hong Kong dollars. British Vulcanized Green rose from 620 Hong Kong dollars to 650 Hong Kong dollars. American Red Bottom Vulcanized Green has even risen to 540 Hong Kong dollars. The intensity of the price surge is unprecedented in recent months. According to a leading figure in the import and export industry in this city, the restoration of the use of Hong Kong-Guangdong "Through-Heaven Permits" can effectively revitalize trade between Hong Kong and Guangdong for a time. However, because the prices of industrial raw materials in Hong Kong have soared, and the inventory of industrial raw materials in this city is extremely empty, prices will inevitably rise accordingly. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the government can quickly open up imports of goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange and without permits, which can not only alleviate the panic of industrial raw materials in this city but also suppress market prices.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Both Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Daily Necessities: In the soap market, the price of caustic soda, a raw material, has soared to 2.9 million yuan per barrel, causing the market to prosper. Rumors of profitable buying are spreading, and the market is rising. At noon, each case of "Guben" soap was 700,000 yuan, and there was still a shortage of supply. Deals were made at 500,000 yuan for "Huang Xiangmao" soap, a further increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. "Guanghua" and "Henry" soap also rose accordingly. The price of matches also rose by about 10% following the soap market.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Trade Agency Announces Detailed Rules for Trade Procedures</h3>
<p>[Tokyo, September 30th, Aviation News] The Japanese Trade Agency announced "Emergency Measures for Private Trade Procedures" as follows: Foreign traders may freely discuss matters such as the quantity, quality, shape, loading time, and packaging form of relevant commodities with Japanese traders, but everything should be reported to the F.O.B., and the price should be calculated according to the US dollar price indicated by the Trade Agency. When starting negotiations, the content should be reported to the Trade Agency by the Trade Corporation as soon as possible. The formal contract of the Trade Agency with foreign traders should only be established after the export preparation application has been approved by the Foreign Trade Section of the Headquarters. Those preparing to export should submit the export preparation application together with the material conversion table and the necessary cost calculation form to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. The corporation and the Trade Agency will then review the trader's ability, quality, etc. If it is deemed excessive, it will be submitted to the Headquarters in the name of trade to request approval. When negotiations are concluded, foreign traders should submit sixteen copies of the sales contract to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. At the same time, Japanese traders should submit an application for concluding a formal contract to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. After the corporation and the Trade Agency have reviewed it and deemed it appropriate, a representative of the Trade Agency and the foreign trader will jointly sign it. The Trade Agency will send ten copies to the Foreign Trade Ankle of the Headquarters to request approval. The contract will only take effect after approval by the Headquarters. After the formal contract is established, foreign traders should issue a confirmed letter of credit within ten days and submit it to the Trade Agency. When Japanese export traders have prepared the goods and are waiting for export, they should submit an export license to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. After the corporation and the Trade Agency have reviewed it and deemed it appropriate, they will sign it and submit it to the Headquarters. When the Trade Agency ships the goods, it must prepare the following documents: 1. Business license, 2. Consular verification license, 3. Bill of lading, 4. Packing certificate, 5. Inspection certificate, 6. Weight and quantity table, 7. Health certificate, food declaration. After shipment, the Trade Agency will review it again, and then the Trade Corporation will submit three copies of the shipping documents, including two copies of the note payable in three months and two copies of the signed circulation shipping bond, to the Foreign Trade Section of the Headquarters. Another copy of the shipping documents and one copy of the export license will be sent to the Eighth Army. After the Foreign Trade Section of the Headquarters inspects the above shipping documents, it will issue them to the bank designated by the Allied Commander-in-Chief together with the check.</p>

<h3>The Velocity of Molecules</h3>
<p>— Zeng Shiyu</p>
<p>Our concept of molecules can be determined by Avogadro's Law—that is, under the same conditions, equal volumes of gas contain the same number of molecules (see the first issue of this journal). But do molecules of each gas have the same characteristics? Gaseous molecules cannot be seen by the human eye, but the most enlightening phenomenon regarding the properties of molecules is diffusion. For example, when a colored or fragrant gaseous substance is placed in one location, its color soon fades and eventually disappears, and its fragrance dissipates without a trace. The reason for this is that gaseous molecules possess motion that propels them in all directions. Because of this motion, when colored or fragrant gases are gathered in one location, the gas disperses over time, until its presence is no longer detectable at the original location.</p>
<p>Since molecules possess motion, can the velocity of each molecule be known? Imagine a beautiful lady suddenly arriving at one end of a room. If we are at the other end, it often takes several minutes to faintly detect the scent of her clothing or perfume. Thus, gas diffusion is apparently a very slow process. Is the velocity of gas molecules also this slow? We must remember that the number of gas molecules inside a room is an extremely large and unimaginable value. When a fragrant molecule detaches from the lady’s clothing at one corner of the room and finally reaches the olfactory organ of a person standing in another corner, it undergoes countless collisions with other molecules. These collisions may cause it to move forward or backward, to the right or to the left. When it moves a mere inch in the room, it is subjected to thousands of twists and turns. Therefore, gas diffusion is a slow process, but the speed of diffusion should not be directly equated with the velocity of the gas molecules themselves.</p>
<p>Since molecules in the air experience collisions, do molecules of the same type of gas, under the same conditions (i.e., same temperature and pressure), also have the same velocity? Because of the mutual collisions between molecules, even if we take molecules of the same type and place them under the same conditions, it is not easy to ensure that their velocities are equal. Imagine two oxygen molecules, A and B, moving at the same speed and in nearly the same direction, meeting at a point where a third molecule, C, also with the same speed, approaches from the opposite direction, intending to collide with A and B at the same point. During the collision, A and B together exert twice the momentum on C, while C can only exert one unit of momentum on A and B. According to the law of action and reaction being equal and opposite, the reaction force of C must equal the action force of A and B. Therefore, after the collision, C must retreat in its original direction with more momentum, and its velocity must nearly double its original value. Similarly, the velocity of A and B upon retreating after the collision will be halved compared to their original speed. Therefore, the velocities of gas molecules, even if originally equal, will quickly change and become distinct after repeated collisions. According to the laws of probability, in a large number of gas molecules, the number of molecules with extremely high speeds approaching infinity will be very small; conversely, the number of molecules with extremely low speeds approaching zero will also be very small. Therefore, the velocities of most molecules are distributed between these two extremes. The British physicist Maxwell, based on physical conditions and using mathematical methods, derived a formula for the distribution of molecular velocities. This formula indicates that the probability of any gas molecule in a given amount of gas having a velocity within a certain range is a function that includes temperature, molecular mass, and velocity—though not a simple function.</p>
<p>For a given amount of gas, although each molecule has a nearly different velocity, under given conditions, the molecules of each gas have an average velocity. This is similar to gathering a crowd of people, where heights vary, but there will be an average height. If we accept Maxwell’s formula as accurate, the average velocity of gas molecules can be calculated using mathematics. But if we do not want to immediately trust this formula, which is entirely derived from theory, we must ask whether there are simpler and clearer methods to infer the average velocity. The first person to make this effort was Joule. His starting point was that when a gas is sealed in a container, each surface of the container is subject to equal pressure. This pressure is due to the continuous collisions of gas molecules against the walls of the container and their subsequent rebounding. Based on the magnitude of this pressure and the total mass of the gas inside the container, the average velocity of the gas molecules can be calculated. For example, the average velocity of molecules in ordinary air, as determined by this method, falls between 400 and 500 meters per second. This value is much greater than the speed of gas diffusion and far exceeds the velocities commonly observed by humans.</p>
<p>Since the velocity of molecules, as calculated, is such an extraordinary value, before we can directly measure the velocity of molecules, are there other observed and confirmed phenomena that can be used to verify whether this extremely high velocity is far from reality? Physicists have long known that the speed of sound in air is 340 meters per second. Air is a substance of very low density, which means that there is a large distance between its molecules. The vibration of sound waves is transmitted through the movement of air molecules and the collisions between them. Therefore, we can imagine that the speed of sound waves propagating in the air must be close to the average velocity of air molecules, and should be somewhat smaller, because the speed of sound waves transmitted through molecular collisions cannot be as fast as molecules flying straight without obstruction. Since the speed of sound is 340 meters per second, it is reasonable to believe that the average velocity of air molecules, as previously calculated to be between 400 and 500 meters per second, is correct. Furthermore, those who fire large-caliber shells on the battlefield have long observed a common phenomenon. If the initial velocity of the shell does not exceed 400 meters per second, the shell loses its velocity more slowly due to air resistance. If the initial velocity of the shell exceeds 400 meters per second, the shell loses this excess velocity in a very short time. The explanation for this phenomenon is that when the initial velocity of the shell exceeds 400 meters per second, a vacuum forms at the base of the shell. This vacuum creates suction and drag on the shell, greatly reducing its excessive velocity. The reason a vacuum forms at the base of the shell is that the velocity of the shell exceeds the average velocity of the air molecules, so the air molecules cannot follow the shell to fill the void left behind it as it flies. This fact also shows that the average velocity of air molecules, as calculated earlier, is indeed accurate.</p>
<p>In the last two or three decades, due to advancements in experimental methods, there have also been experiments to verify the law of gas molecule velocity distribution and its average value. The first to conduct these experiments was Stern of Germany. Many others followed suit. The results all sufficiently prove that Maxwell’s formula and the numerical values initially calculated from gas pressure are correct.</p>
<h3>Habits of Desert Animals</h3>
<p>— Guanchao</p>
<p>Some animals can adapt to dry environments by regulating the loss of water in their bodies. One of the ways they adapt is through nocturnal habits, because deserts are extremely hot and dry during the day, and temperatures drop sharply at night. Animals such as lions, desert foxes, hyenas, and most insects like scorpions and spiders hide in shady places during the day to reduce body evaporation. They come out to forage at night, which not only reduces water consumption but also allows them to benefit from the moisture of dew. Some animals have particularly thick skin or are covered with a protective layer, protecting them from the strong sunlight, much like plants with very thick cuticles, which also reduces water loss. That is why beetles in the desert can still fly around freely during the day, unafraid of the sunlight, because they have thick elytra to protect them. Similarly, many lizards in the desert have scales, which serve the same purpose. Spiny-tailed lizards, called Agamas, in the deserts of North Africa and Asia, have bodies covered in spiny scales, resembling strong battle armor. In Australia, there is a peculiar lizard whose scales can even absorb water, which is obviously not for protection but for storing water.</p>
<p>Some animals have the habit of hibernation, much like some desert plants that can rely on seeds or dormant buds to hibernate for months or years, surviving unfavorable conditions. Desert snails can also stop moving when dry, as if dead. They revive when exposed to humid air, and their hibernation can often last for several years. Some snails close the opening of their shells with mud to protect their internal organs when they begin to hibernate. This hibernation ability is even more common in aquatic animals in the desert. When pools of water accumulate in the desert, many crustaceans and shellfish appear, living out their short period of activity. They use eggs to survive the dry and food-scarce periods. In some Australian deserts, shrimps and crabs can grow from eggs to animals two and a half inches long in just half a month. This extremely rapid growth is a common phenomenon among simpler animals in the desert, adapting to the dry desert environment.</p>
<p>This makes us think of a question: if these animals living in the desert were to move to another environment with abundant and evenly distributed rainfall, wouldn't they reproduce even faster? Wouldn't they grow even better? Why do these animals always live in harsh environments and cannot spread or proliferate to the neighboring areas of the desert with better living conditions? In actual observation, it is not difficult to see that the animals most suited to the desert environment are the least suitable for living in rainy areas. For example, considering the nature of desert plants, especially their scattered distribution, it is not only due to the direct impact of low rainfall. It is also because the terrain of the desert is simple, without flowing water causing any changes in the topography. Although wind can sometimes move sand dunes or rainwater can form temporary rivers, it is nothing like the complex topography of rainy areas. Therefore, desert plants can be freely distributed across the vast desert, while they are extremely restricted in rainy areas. Higher animals are similarly restricted to a desert life. The most obvious is their extreme speed, because the ground is flat and dry. Animals like the wild donkeys of the Gobi Desert and the wild horses of Mongolia, which are nearly the same color as the sand, often live in groups because they move so quickly that they can sleep in the open without being easily harmed by other fierce predators. Even those birds with developed wings walk more often than they fly in the desert. Birds that are good at walking have very degenerate wings, specifically adapted to the desert environment, such as the African ostrich, which is a good example. Many beetles have lost their ability to fly and can only crawl quickly. Animals that are not good at crawling often adapt to a burrowing life, and their limbs are always adapted to digging loose sand, such as the Spink Lizard of Africa, which is a famous burrowing animal, sometimes called the sand dragon. These habits would not only be unsuitable in rainy and topographically complex areas but would also be detrimental. For example, the camel's long legs and flat toes only allow it to walk quickly on sand, and it has great difficulty moving on muddy ground, and humid air is detrimental to its health. There is also a small burrowing rat in the desert with very long hind legs that moves quickly, as if flying. It has no weapons of self-defense, lives in burrows during the day, comes out to forage at night, and has keen hearing and vision. It uses its short front limbs to bring food to its mouth and sits on its hind legs, so it can see farther and detect enemies. If this animal lived in a place with abundant plants, it would be difficult to detect enemies and would not be able to move freely and quickly to escape danger. The Egyptian burrowing rat can only live in dry places. If it encounters humid air, it will go into hibernation. Another adaptive trait that often prevents animals from living in other environments is that their color is often yellow, similar to the color of the sand, which can be used as camouflage. In places with abundant plants, they are easily detected by enemies and may be killed. However, there are a few exceptions, such as the lion, whose coat color and lack of special food-grabbing abilities are originally adapted to desert life, but its strength and intelligence undoubtedly enable it to survive in other environments. Some animals that eat food have strong adaptability and can live outside the desert, but in fact, their distribution is quite limited due to the prevalence or overabundance of enemies. Animals such as desert locusts or snails can reproduce rapidly when plants are abundant and spread to areas outside the desert, but once they reach new areas, they are caught by many insectivorous animals, and few can survive. This fact can explain why certain types of insects in the desert never proliferate to areas near the desert.</p>
<h3>Words of Fallen Leaves</h3>
<p>— Wan Peng</p>
<p>In the tropics, where rainfall is abundant, trees grow without obstruction, so there is no leaf-fall phenomenon. However, in temperate regions, when autumn deepens and the temperature turns cold, most plants cannot fully carry out carbon assimilation and transpiration, but their vitality cannot stop immediately, so there is the phenomenon of leaf fall. After many plants shed their leaves, the part where the petiole detaches is very smooth, such as with the Chinese parasol tree and the fig. This is because before the petiole detaches from the branch, a special tissue forms near the petiole, which is the abscission layer, cutting off the connection between the leaf and the branch.</p>
<p>The ordinary abscission layer grows between the base of the petiole and the trunk of the branch. Leaves that have grown an abscission layer wither due to lack of nutrients, so cutting a part of a branch that is actively living and stopping the supply of water to it will naturally cause the leaves to wither, and thus leaf fall occurs through the abscission layer. In the Virginia creeper of the grape family, the abscission layer grows between the leaf and the petiole itself, and between the base of the petiole and the trunk of the branch.</p>
<p>The abscission layer is composed of several layers of parenchyma cells, with shiny substances inside the cells. This is fat, which turns brown when silver nitrate is added. When the abscission layer has not yet detached, the colors are inconsistent on the two sides near it, especially on the enlarged petiole. To test whether the abscission layer has formed, the starch in the surrounding tissue can be tested. If an abscission layer has formed, the petiole part will not change color when potassium iodide solution is added, which proves that an abscission layer has formed.</p>
<p>These parenchyma cells of the petiole are acicular crystals, so they are very smooth after detachment; the fine granular spots left on the scar after leaf fall are traces of vascular bundles.</p>
<p>Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived and fallen leaves are flying, we should know why.</p>
<h3>Talking About Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Zhong Kai</p>
<p>A recent report in a London medical journal analyzing cigarette smoke stated, "The poisons contained therein, in addition to nicotine, include carbon monoxide (CO), aldehydes, and furfural." Nicotine in tobacco leaves is usually combined with malic acid and citric acid, but when heated and under reduced pressure (or smoking), it can be decomposed. Carbon monoxide is caused by incomplete combustion, while aldehydes and furfural are produced from the burning of glycerin, licorice extract, and other substances added during cigarette manufacturing to adjust the flavor. We know that a drop of nicotine can cause a cat to convulse and die, and three grams of nicotine can be fatal to humans. In fact, carbon monoxide is no less potent; it immediately interacts with hemoglobin in the blood, rendering it unable to transport oxygen to the body. Acids are the strongest irritants and have an irritating effect on the mucous membrane of the lungs. Trace amounts of aldehydes can cause tremors and convulsions.</p>
<p>Although a cigarette can temporarily soothe the mind of a smoker, it affects their physical health and numbs their spiritual sensibilities. Those who do not smoke should never easily become addicted to smoking.</p>
<h3>Latest Tuberculosis Prevention Vaccine</h3>
<p>— Hui Shi</p>
<p>Following BCG, three bacteriologists from the National Institutes of Health of the US Public Health Department, Dr. Picard, Dr. Heber, and Dr. Alpha, recently announced that a new tuberculosis vaccine has been developed. For guinea pigs, this new type of vaccine is as effective as BCG in preventing tuberculosis, and it may replace BCG for widespread application.</p>
<p>This new vaccine is made from the bacteria of deceased tuberculosis patients, taken from a patient with a highly virulent strain of tuberculosis in Tennessee. After extraction, the bacteria are killed using ultraviolet light in a secret method. Because they are dead, doctors are bold enough to use them, but precise and careful research is still required before they can be administered to humans.</p>
<p>In the experiment, guinea pigs were administered a large dose of tuberculosis bacteria one week after receiving a single injection of the vaccine. They all contracted tuberculosis, but their lifespan was twice as long as that of guinea pigs who had not received the vaccine before being exposed to tuberculosis bacteria!</p>
<h3>The Almighty "Pegasus" — Bao Zhongqi</h3>
<p>An expert in helicopter research recently wrote a book titled "The Almighty Horse." He believes that the helicopter is like a Pegasus in the sky, with amazing capabilities: it can quickly fly to designated locations with 500 pounds of air express mail; it can perform high-altitude surveying tasks; it can also transport 2,400-pound jeeps elsewhere; and most miraculously, it can replace manpower in laying oil pipelines or guiding water sources. According to American experimental results, helicopters can lay as many as 400 feet of rubber pipe in 25 seconds!</p>
<h3>The Future of Television</h3>
<p>— Wan Gongyu</p>
<p>Einstein—now the world's greatest mathematician—is famous for his theory of relativity. This theory accurately indicated the principles of atomic energy. He has another great achievement: a new "eye" for the television camera (similar to the lens of a camera). This new eye is a thousand times more sensitive than before. We know that the main function of a television camera relies on the photoelectric effect of a photocell, and if this photocell is very sensitive, the camera can transmit extremely weak light or extremely subtle movements to the receiver. Einstein said as early as 1905 that the laws of the photoelectric effect are very different from what people generally assumed at the time, and this new invention is a direct result of his 1905 instructions. Einstein's photoelectric effect equation has been applied in practical work for almost forty years, and now television has a new vision, even more sensitive than human vision - its precision has made it possible for photographic equipment to work in the dark.</p>
<p>For a television receiver owner after the war, this is equivalent to a new radio that can report various sports or news in any climate, with candlelight or the weak flash of a match. You can even use it to see floods during rain, raging fires during fires, and even police arresting people under streetlights at night.</p>
<p>There will also be new developments in television entertainment. You no longer have to struggle to see small and tight scenes under the concentrated light of many mercury lamps. You can see the drama on stage as if you were in a theater, with every small movement and scene perfectly displayed. This new "eye" can convey the gentle lighting in a love scene, or the terrifying and dim atmosphere in a secret murder scene; even the light of a cigarette, behind which is the silhouette of a large smoker. In other words, all the subtle human movements - the result is something that Einstein probably never dreamed of forty years ago!</p>
