<h3>社論　憲政的光榮開始</h3>
<p>中華民國憲法於本日起開始實行，去歲的制憲國民大會旣有決議，國府亦經頒有明令。從此國家入於憲政的常軌，在國民黨旣得以實現其還政於民的宿願，在人民亦足以償喁喁望治的殷望。中華民國三十六年十二月二十五日這一天，因之，在中國民族的歷史上實是一個重要的分界。茲當行憲開始之日，回顧以往，展望將來，誠有不能已於言者，謹申數端，藉以祝頌：</p>
<p>我們首先於此不能不指出的是中國憲政的開始，正値公元一九四七年的耶穌聖誔。此其意義，自極深長。主席於聖誔前夕的廣播辭內，已經很明顯地指出，他說：『當我想到今年耶穌聖誔節的時候，我就想念到我們中國在這個令節的一天就要開始實施民主新憲法了。這個紀念，我認為是十分寶貴的。中華民國三十六年　就是耶穌降生一九四七年的聖誔節，將是我們中華民國和全體人民統一獨立平等自由新生機運肇始的一天，我們新憲法特點，就是它保證要把基督敎理的基本要素，卽個人尊敬與自由，普必由之路的給予我們全國的同胞。』我們不行憲開始之日，正値耶穌聖誔，這意義實在重要，不特在我國歷史是劃期的，且在人類歷史上亦是劃期的。中國的開始實行憲政，沒有比十二月廿五日這一天更適當的了：這是耶聖誔，又是雲南起義紀念日，這眞是我國憲政光榮的開始。</p>
<p>重建後之臨沂城南門與城上指揮所側影（本報特派員麗天寄）</p>
<p>中國不是一個以基督敎為國敎的國家，而且我們也沒有國敎；但我們憲政的開如郤在耶穌聖誔。以一個非基督敎的國家，而擇定耶穌聖誔節為開始行憲之日，這在人類史上是劃斯的。耶穌基督的誔生，使人類遭逢了新生。自其誔生以後，人類可期臻入永生之境。因耶穌的寶血，使人類得以淸除罪惡：從信仰而產生希望，從信仰而產生仁愛。人類因耶穌的誔生而進入一種新境域，得到超脫，得到解放。中國憲政的開始在耶穌聖誔這一天，亦正是以表示由於憲政的開始，可以使中國得到解放，得到超脫，進入一種新的境域。我們的國家超脫解放了的新境域是什麼？就是國民黨還政與民。此後中華民國眞正到達了民有民治民享的全民政治的境域；國家根本大法旣經實施，從此實行「憲法之治」可期。正如耶穌的誔生，堅定我們的信仰，由信仰而產生希望和仁愛一樣，我國行憲的開始，亦應堅定我們對於民族國家，乃至整個世界的信心，更由此信心而產生新的希望。這信心是什麼？就是無論當前的情景如何陰晦，秩序如何紊亂，局勢如何動盪，中國民族的前途還是有希望的，世界的前途也還是有光明的。</p>
<p>我們更應該指出的是中國的憲法內蘊着豐富的基督敎精神。主席在他的廣播詞裏旣指出：「我們新憲法的特點就是它保證要把基督敎理的基本要素，卽個人的尊嚴與自由，普遍的給予我們全國的同胞，」可知我國的憲法，實具有基督敎理的成分很多，為一都符合基督敎理的法典，足以反映基督敎精神的法典。以一個非基督敎的國家而有這樣一種根本大法，實為我民族之福，此實不能不說由於　主席的精神感召。我們肝衡世界大局，如果世界眞有分裂，則此一分裂，決不是東方與西方的分裂，而將是基督敎世界與非基督敎世界的分裂。非督敎的勢力也許能稱覇一時，然其結果，却沒有不失敗的。基督敎信衆在我國全人口中的比例雖還不高，但有此具有基督敎精神的憲法很明顯地指示給我們此後應走的方向。我們雖在東方，但我們不承認有東西的分裂。由於此一憲法的施行，我們在國家民族的根本法方面，幾乎已經基督敎化了。此一大法的開始施行能再有比耶穌聖誔更好的日子嗎？</p>
<p>我們回想過去三十餘年來的慘痛經騐，當茲行憲之日，誠如　主席所云，這是我們所必須償付的代價。「如果沒有這苦痛和黑暗的一面，人生也就無所謂快樂和光明了。我們知道國家和人民在這樣慘痛的煎熬之中，得到了眞正的提鍊，我們的痛苦給我們以新生的活力與經騐，將使我們國家民族克服當前的一切艱難，必須達到勝利的終點。我們有了這種認識，這種信仰，我們就能望見歷盡艱苦終獲勝利的耶穌基督，站在我們前面，做指引我們國家的明燈，鼓勵我們的新生。」以耶穌基督來做我們的明燈，此後我們不愁有黑暗，不愁有艱苦，這實是我們憲政的光榮開始！</p>
<h3>一年來民航　李景潞發表談話</h3>

<h3>滬西報與公會爭執　與新聞自由無關　董顯光在記者會解釋</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿四日電〕黃顯光廿四日在記者招待會稱：關於海兩西報與報業公會因紙張限額分配之爭論，國外若干評論家，不明眞相者，遽作違反事實之斷語，頗為遺憾。本人今獲悉：紐約某日報社評有謂「中國當局對抨擊政府之報紙，實行限制其紙張配額，以為限制新聞自由之一種途徑」，復稱「大美晚報設一旦被迫停刋，則中國實無最少限度之出版自由可言」，香港報紙亦以同樣論調批評此事。此種評論全由誤解，蓋紙張分配之爭論，起因於上海報業公會之一項決議，中國政府墍新聞自由之問題，固與上項爭論毫無關聯。按現行制度，政府核定各大城市之紙張限額，然後由各地報業公會議定各報配額。公會為各報社之自由組織，不受政府之支配或影響，各會員報社如對公會決義發生爭執，則可申請輸出入管理委員會限額分配處作最後決定。此次上海發生爭論，乃紙張分配制度實施以來之首宗事件。政府於獲知是項爭論以後，即由輸管會張主委嘉　確吿兩家西報，即飭該會限額分配處進行調查，以謀事件之公平解決。事件之發生，決非政府　　新聞自由之結果。此點大美晚報當知之最騐。本人茲引該報社評「草率論斷」一文，以資佐證。該報稱：「吾人與報業公會爭論之時，對於香港報界支持吾人立塲之善意，表示殊深感奮。同時，吾人必須指出香港報界認為中國政府居心不善一點，料屬錯誤。吾人兩對中國政府施行挾擊，然吾人必須同時注意中國政府頗有接受批評之雅量，而無管制言論之意圖」。大美晚報對於此事爭論在海外所造成之錯誤觀念勇於紏正，本人出頗感欣慰！</p>

<h3>東北共匪竄擾無碍剿匪軍事</h3>
<p>東北匪軍為率制國軍兵力的調動和策應中原陳毅劉伯承匪部的流竄，於未及整補完　，便輕率發動竄擾，其主要目的在破壞交通及煤礦，阻獲國家補究調練；自十二月十三日起，匪軍先以李遷呂部人八九兩縱隊，破壞北寗鐵咱，威脅錦州，同時以遼西黃克誠部的二七兩縱隊接近康平·彰開以北地區，至下六日到處過實就虛，開始鑽隙進擾，十七日後，中長路與北寗路兩面的匪軍，先後竄抵黑山，白旗堡·新立屯·彰武·法庫和　陽北的看佛寺附近；在中長路東側的匪軍一·三·四·八各縱隊，及由吉長綫南竄的第六續隊，先後陷昌圖，烟台煤礦及大石橋，圍攻新開原·鐵　北的中固·遼陽東北的華溝夫等國軍陣地，並於昌國附近開原和遼陽北的烟台各空隙地點，越過議路西竄，企圖先攻陷法庫，新民·破壞交通，　　　軍　陽西北外國的兵力，以作孤立潘陽的準備。國軍對於共匪此項冒驗竄犯的行動，除開頭便在法庫南的三家子沙後所和遼南大石橋兩地給予迎頭打擊，傷斃匪軍第二·第八兩縱隊官兵約六千人外，還由四平·遼陽·開原·錦州·彰武各地加以反擊，至二十日，國軍已光復了遼西的石山·北鎭·遼陽的烟台·灌北的石佛寺·而錦州·義縣·北票·彰武·康平·開原·鐵嶺各要地，仍在國軍控制中，雖然匪軍用了十多萬人，向法庫·新民製擊擾亂，甚至屢販屢攻，但除了破壞交通及人民生活秧序安寗與陰止國軍整補訓練中，並不足以影響全國剿匪軍事</p>

<h3>酣舞高歌聖誕節　幾家歡樂幾家愁　富有的盡情陶醉貧苦的喘息不遑</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕聖誕節，多少人沉醉鼓舞的日子！寒流暫時離開了人間，瘋狂的米價却又替這都市劃出鴻溝。富有的人盡情歡樂，貧苦的大眾在米價下喘息。中正西路福特公司的大橱窗中，兩隻鹿拖着一輛新型「福特」，車帝聖誕老人背負了滿滿一布袋的鈔票，穩窗外面的人都給這綺麗的恩物吸引住了，一批一批地圍上來，但有什麼呢？那不過是廣告啊！</p>
<p>聖誕老人今年究竟能帶給我們一點什麼呢？庇寒所內外成千成萬的難民每晚做着遼遠的幻夢。從街頭橋堍，從路邊弄底，他們期待收容車能杷他們裝進庇寒所。在聖誕的前夕，所裏發覺到剛收容進來的一羣中，有一個身上藏着九張當票；有一個熬不住飢餓，吃了攤頭上十六塊豆腐乾，沒有錢付賬，給攤販扭住了；還有一個呌張玉書的，據說做過南京大衆日報的記者，因爲失業狠久，到上海來訪友未遇，被警局懊認爲難民，給强制收容進來了，他含着一泡眼淚向人說：「外面面在該正在熱烈的狂歡着吧？」</p>
<p>可貴的溫情　瑟縮的一羣</p>
<p>狂歡何嘗不是事實？舞廳樂台上奏着最剌激的旋律，二十萬元一杯茶，五十萬元一客聖誕大菜，每家舞池裏祇看見高高低低的紙帽子興奮地轉動；十一點鐘了，舞塲營業的限制怎能約束攀情，尋酒吧，找朋友，易地婆娑，有聖誕樹，火鷄，銀鈴，氣球的地方便有溫暖，這可貴的溫暖啊！天際一勾上弦殘月，正同時徹夜淸冷地照臨着踡伏在路邊的一羣！</p>
<p>失事的餘悸　保證了安全</p>
<p>月明星稀，長空萬里，聖誕夜的旅客們該是最幸運的。去年今日三隻客機同時失事的餘悸猶存，但今年散華機塲的大跑道和指揮燈已保證了這厄運的不會再來，是上帝祝福這些營營逐逐於千里關山之間的可憐的人羣吧？沒有霧，沒有風，好一個明凈的聖誕前夜！去年墮機倖存的王小弟弟，已在愉快地渡越了他蒙難的一週紀念日了。</p>
<p>聽祝福鐘聲　慶民族復興</p>
<p>客居在這異鄉已經近月的新疆歌舞團，他們也以愉快的心情迎接着這個並不屬於他們宗敎的節日。他們在十月廿三那天，已在南京渡過「犧牲節」，也就是已渡過了伊斯蘭敎的新年。當初他們由京來滬，車車剛進北站，第一個使他們　到驚奇的是止海「人的密度」。他們　想假如在一個盛大的節日裏，這人的密度不知將會發展到怎樣程度？聖誕終於到來了，他們決定　此機會，到各處細心觀光。這狂熱的日子在邊疆同胞的眼中將更是値得驚異的吧？</p>
<p>敎堂中祝福的鐘聲響起的時候，你會否知道今天除了聖誕之外，也是我們自己的民族復與節，行憲開始的日子！</p>

<h3>花紗布管理辦法通過後　袁主委返滬籌備　管委會決定明年新正成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國花紗布管理辦法，業經廿三日行政院第卅五次例會通過，全文已見昨日。本報。花紗布管理委員會主委袁良，當於昨日下午二時四十五分，携同通過之管理辦法返滬，即驅車赴紡調會，召集紗管會各主管處室負責人談話，（計秘書，採運，製造，配銷，財務，會計六處，人事，督察，稽核三室）。商討各種辦事細則，及一應單據之印艱等事務，並對原紡調會全部人事，作最後之甄審，以定去留，而便交替。</p>
<p>袁氏於昨日下午五時，在紡調會接見記者。承告：花紗布全面管制政策之施行，係奉中樞最高當局親筆手論。綠中樞鑒於邇來各地物價波動，爲安定民生計，首要在掌握物資管理游資。故首以花紗布之全面管制，總以全國金融之管理。</p>
<p>新管理辦法通過後，原鵝紡調會，將儘本年底前辦理結束。紡管會則定明年一月二日正式成立。</p>
<p>紗管會成立後，第一步工作，將辦理普遍之登記。計包括：　登記紗廠存棉數量，每日產紗數量，現在存紗數量，今後消費棉花數量。　登記複製業存紗數量俾便辦理以紗易布事宜。　登記棉商存棉數量，定價收購。以上登記日期，自明年一月二日起，本埠至同月十日截止，外埠至同月十五日截止。一方面令行，一方面公告。如逾期不辦理登記，將予適當之處份。</p>
<p>對收購國棉一事，袁氏表示，處此兵慌馬亂時期，軍運浩繁，交通情形不常，未能斷言把握。惟將視原棉實際供需情形，而轍入適量之外棉，以資調度。</p>
<p>袁氏旋出示紡調會所編本市廿五種主要物價上漲比較及位次表，以本年一月五日及本年十二月十一日之市價相比較，則美棉漲百分之二〇三〇，佔第十一位。沙市棉漲百分之一九九八，佔第十二位。廿支時雙馬漲百分之一二一〇，佔第十九位。龍頭細布漲百分之一一二九，佔第廿一位。四十二支雙股藍鳳漲百分之八三七，佔第廿五位。可見花紗布之漲勢，仍慶平穩。而原料所漲，較成品爲多，亦足顯示一般購買力之減縮。</p>
<p>目前全國棉紡工業，共有紗錠四五〇萬枚，而實際運轉數，僅三百六十餘萬枚。渠望能在一年半敝之內，全部開足，俾增加棉紗生產，推廣外銷。</p>
<p>袁氏最後表示：此次花紗布管理政策之實施，深望人民與政府取得澈底之合作，一掃以前之觀望踟蹰態度。渠舉登記爲例，如申報登記數字翔實者，將來定必反沾便宜。故切望官民能赤誠合作，俾花紗布管理政策，能發揮最大之功能云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國花紗布管理辦法經行政院通渦後，記者特向六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇氏徵詢意見。王氏表示不願發表任何意見，僅靜候辦法之執行耳。惟渠個人有一建議，即執行辦法之人事，無論上至各主管處室負責人，下至各地實際執行工作之人員，務求對花紗布各關係部門，須有完整純熟之經驗。換言之，須爲花紗布各部門之內行人才，庶執行辦法時，可省除許多不必要之虧損及延擱。</p>
<h3>永紗俏後步回　小型股多漲停</h3>

<h3>「史學家與科學學」</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>（Gaetano　Salvemini原著，周謙冲敎授譯，商務印書館出版。）</p>
<p>在未介紹這本畫之前，我們先把原作者沙爾非米尼敎授（Prof．Gaetano　Salvemini）介紹給讀者，他是當代義大利最偉大的史學家，對義大利文明史有着獨特的造詣詣。一九二五年當惡魔索里尼和其法西斯黨徒剛開始呌喊聲，這位一代史學大師，不思坐視這些作賤人民的惡貨猖獗，他第一次在佛羅侖斯大學的講座上向全義大利人民和全世界揭發這個集團的獨裁和危險；因而遭捕。出獄後亡命於英國，繼而到美國，在這個新大陸上他講學於耶魯大學和哈佛大學，並盡力暴露墨魔的獨裁罪行，與同時在美國的大作曲家托斯十尼尼（義人）此唱銜和，鼓動義人起來反抗法西斯。</p>
<p>這本書是沙氏在芝加哥大學的講演集，所以文詞淸淡，保持着談話的格調，閱讀起來倍加親切。並且術語很少，由淺入深，加之譯者周謙冲敎授的淸趣筆調，使這本巨著絕沒有板起一副莊巖面孔好像道德家在講道說經的那樣苦澀，因之我們特向讀者們推薦：這是最近出版的一本很難得的書。</p>
<p>近一二十年任何國家的人都盲目的信從着一些自然科學家關於政治的經濟的和文化的意見，這使沙爾非米尼敎授惑到很憤慨，以他的淵博的學問來反駁那些認爲「歷史就是常識」或者「歷史就是藝術」的論調，史學本身就是一門科學，史學家也是一個科學家，不過不是自然科學家而已，（沙氏稱自然科學爲「物理世界的科學」，人文利學爲「人類世界的科學」）。史學和物理對科學而言並不是一「是」和一「非」之差別，而是」「多」一「少」之差異，因爲史學上的一切結諭和論據不能和物理一樣有百分之百的眞實性，因之，史學家「喪失了很多信仰者」。史學家所研究的事實必然是帶有惟一性和複雜性的，他不能用客觀標準去測量其所硏究的孫象，他不能把已經過了兩三百年的歷史再來重複一次，使他經無次的試騐後，像物理家一樣以尋求因果關係。因之，史學家的結論是允許有偏見和錯誤的，而且是需要時時修改的。但這不能說史學家不是科學家；假使如此，我們可以宣佈巴斯德（Pasteur）不是科學家，因爲他認爲一切疾病皆由於病菌，但今天醫學界已證明疾病是由於某種維他命的缺少，或者器官的失常，因爲巴斯德有錯誤，所以不是科學家能講的通嗎？同樣也可用到人文科學上。還有史學界中許多比較單純的部門如古文字學，錢譜學，牠的眞實性和有系統性並不遜色於任何自然枓學。這是說現象愈簡單，就愈接近枓學的範疇。反之，在化學中，愈複雜的變化中愈不接近眞實性，迄今尙有許多無法證明其眞實與否的假說。</p>
<p>摹於許多討諭後，原作者認爲史學家甚至社會科學家沒有是完全無錯誤的，而且允許有偏見的，他之用偏見去尋求一件歷史現象的因果關係正如一個自然科學家用假說去企圖解釋一件物理現象一樣。「在解決社會問題上，既沒有人是無錯誤的，那末，解決社會問題的惟一途徑，就在嘗試各種解決辦法……，我們沒有把握，在社會問題上擁有絕對眞理。因之，我們必須勿蔑視與我們站在反對地位的種種觀點；我們沒有權利去用暴力手段來滅他人的意見。」這是沙翁全書的精華，也就是他的自由民主思想的理論根據，誠如他說，「只有法西斯主義者才說「索里尼永遠是對的」，天主敎信徒才去服從「一個上帝，一個眞理，一個耶穌敎會」和那些固持的共產主義者才認爲「馬克斯的資本論永遠是沒有錯誤」」，自由主義者應當有「謙德和恕道」，在解決社會問題上有嘗試與可能有錯的態度——就像英國人所說的「暗中摸索」（"Muddling　the　rough"）一樣；不尊重敵方的意見和發言權就是非科學精神，那種史學家我們不承認是眞正史學家，更不能爲科學家了。</p>
<p>在討論哲學和歷史的關係上，我們有點不敢茍同於沙翁的意見，他說「哲學家的著作似乎是雲霧的製造廠，會把我的觀念變混亂……我沒有歷史哲學。」但是作者却忘了自己爲什麼謳歌民主自由，反對法西斯獨裁，那不就是他的歷史哲學嗎？也許這是他在過分謙虛呢。</p>
<p>在這本書的後面又附一篇極有價値的論文「何謂文化？」大致說和前面不太有連貫。文中沙爾非米尼敎授對近代的敎育制度有中肯的攻學，「許多敎師認爲讀書治學，必須博聞强記，具備百科全書的知識；這種疾病就是「食古不化」。使敎師和學生兩方面的思想健康損壞了」，「學校不能灌輸的知識——爲人生所必需的，有用的或愉樂的知識。學校所能供給的，是少數淸楚明白，組織有條不紊的事實和觀念，能够作爲一種結構，把將來更多的人生經驗配置於其中。」作者這種論調和蕭伯納的論調有許多相同之處，因之這最後的一篇論文也許對學校的敎師和學生更是値得一畫了。</p>
<p>通讀全書後，我還認爲一個健全的史學家對自然科學也應有良好的基礎，看沙氏的許多引證到物理，天文學和醫學的文句，使我們知道他對「物質世界的科學」並沒有放鬆，而有極高深的造詣的，與那些光向舊紙字簍　的史學家大爲不同。</p>
<h3>新三角學講義</h3>
<p>— 索伊</p>
<p>（朱鳳豪編著，能門聯合書局發行。）</p>
<p>中學敎科書的採用最令人感棘手的便是科學敎科書。國人自編的多嫌蘭陋，而完全採用原版書又不實用，因此一般學生們多感不便。就筆者所知，朱先生所著的新三角學講義實在是目下數學敎科書中最完備而又最實用的一本。</p>
<p>朱先生憑了數十年敎學的經驗，又採合了歐美諸數學家的精華，經過了數十次的實地敎授，最後才完成了本書。雖然作者自謙「遺漏謬誤之處尙多」，但就筆者所知，除了第二十二頁習題四第二題漏去」已知X爲銳角」，和一二七頁習題十三第一題第二條「一」應改爲「十」外，簡直找不着錯誤之處。可說是敎科書中錯誤最少的一本。</p>
<p>筆者所最要推崇的便是本書具有幾特點：第一，關於恒等式（第三章和第七章），方程式，測量問題（第四章和十一章）反三角函數（第八章）及消去法（第十二豎）都列爲專章，每章分類再加以充分的討論。關於解題的各種方法都有詳細的說明，尤其是「一之代用法」。第二，全書中所有的重要例題，都列有不同的解法多種，可使讀者研究的興趣因以提高。第三，本書在例題之旁都加劃方框，註明該題解法上的特點，以醒眉目而加深學習者的影像。第四，三角在解析幾何上的應用，也選例很多，可使讀者將三角解幾合爲一體而收觸類旁通之益。</p>
<p>尤其是第七章的證題雜例最令讀者歡迎。在這裏舉了各種的證法，如棣美弗（Demcivre）的引用，特種角函數的化法，有限積式和有限級數諸問題的解法以及等差級數，等比級數等問題。並舉了一百個各種解法的習應，讀者解去如嚼橄櫝，愈做愈感到興味。關於消去法（Eliminaion）方法，作者本人認爲還不够完備，尙擬再予增加。那末，本書可說是盡善盡美的了。</p>
<p>最後，我謹引作者的一句銘言作爲結束：「多一次校勘，少貽誤讀者」。我希望全國的作家們多多爲自己的著作下一翻校勘的苦功，這才是最神聖的工作！</p>
<h3>一部研究日本的參考書</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>「日本研究資料」中華學藝社編　大成版</p>
<p>戰爭已經結束了兩年，對德和約尙在磋商中，對日和會還不知如何解決。第二次世界大戰，日本可算是罪魁禍首，但因爲國際間的予盾，致使戰敗的日本，能够從容地從事於善後復興的工作。雖然處於盟軍管制之下，然其堅忍努力的精神，正顯示勃勃的野心，大有東山再起之勢。反觀戰勝的我國，田於烽烟未息，人民尙不能安享太平。</p>
<p>過去我們所遭到日本的苦痛，已經够受了，看到目前日本的情形，實不勝隱憂。乘對日和約尙未解決以前，我們必須解除日本的戰爭因素。這不懂是爲了中國，對於遠東的和平，世界的安全，都有關係的。要解除日本的作戰因素，必須先得明瞭日本的情況。</p>
<p>中華學藝社編了一部日本硏究資料，是戰後最新的有系統的研究日本問題的書。將日本戰後的情形，當前的問題，分別地來叙述。全書共十册，每一册單獨論述一個問題。「戰後日本與盟國」，「對日管制概說」，「戰後日本的財政經濟」，「戰後日本的業來狀况」，「戰後日本的文敎」五種已經出版，尙有「投降前後的日本政局」，「戰後日本的政黨與議會」，「戰後日本憲法與皇室」，「戰後的日本社會」，和「戰後日本的文藝」則正在排印中。從他的題目來看，已經是把我們所需知道的日本情形，都包括了。</p>
<p>再從已出版五種的內容來說：「戰後日本與盟國」和「對日管制概說」，是報導兩年來對於多人說美國國縱容日本，但縱容到如何的程度呢？這裏可以得到一個解答。今後在和約中對日本應如何處理，也可以作一參考。</p>
<p>在和約中，有一個重要的議題，今後日本的工業水準，應如何規定。由於各國的處境不同，各人的見解不同，故有不同的意見。在「戰後日本的財政和經濟」與「戰後日本的實業狀况」兩書中，詳細地叙述了現今日本的經濟情形。我們可從這裏，知道那許多廠應該拆除的，那許多生產應該限制的。賠償物資如何決定，財閥解散，執行到如何的程度，對外貿易，應採取何種政策，都可以得到一個答案。</p>
<p>要解除日本作戰的因素，最要緊的，是改造日本人的思想。過去日本所宣傳的軍國民主義，和施行的武士道敎育，是使今後日本走向民主的最大障礙。所以要解除日本的戰爭威脅，要保障遠東以及世界的永久和平，日本的敎育必須加以一番改造。「戰後日本的文敎」，叙述日本敎育的現狀，兼及宗敎，思想，科學等等，兩年來日本再敎育收到怎樣的後果，我們可以知道了。</p>
<h3>學習心理之話</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>傅彬然着　開明書店出版　定價一元九角</p>
<p>這裏沒有學習的方法，講的只是學習的方向；假使拿一艘船來譬喻，這不是使船進行的槳，而是定船左右的舵。</p>
<p>全書十二章，並不連貫銜接，每章都有其自己的獨立性，但是大體上仍舊有系統可尋。有不少關於新的心理衛生見解，著者用淺易通常的例子把它引出來，然後再參述可靠的實騐，旁徵博引淸楚地給刻劃出一個鮮明的輪廊來，使讀者能深印不忘。</p>
<p>「學習就是個人對於環境的刺激去作適當的反應的一種活動」，著者在第一章里先將這最流行的學習的解釋解釋了二遍。所以在接下去的幾章里一再强調環境對學習的影嚮，根據遺傅論和環境論歸納的結果，著者詔爲「遺傳所賦給我們的只是各種特定的能力而非內容；而能力也只是可能的傾向，一種可塑性的出發點而已」，是以從敎育的立塲來看，遣傳能力的能否充分發展既然端賴乎環境之優劣，環境對個人發展的影饗自比遺傳重要得多。即由於此，除了僅佔百分之二的天才與白癡之外，通常中人之資的命運，均得由個人自身努力的程度來決定的。而所謂天才，也只有通過社會，通過羣衆，才得發揮，不然，「聰明反被聰明誤」，歷史上多少輝煌一世的天才們，最後却是英雄末路，爲天下笑；這便是最好的殷鑒。</p>
<p>然而個人的成敗固然得冀自已努力的程度，但是努力却也得有努力的方針與方法。技能與知識的學習，重在應用與瞭解，我們應該探求合於現實的，科學的，民主的；非空想的，玄學的，少數人獨佔的眞知識，活知識；而剔除食而不化，無稗實用的死東西這道就是我們所以要推翻從前的科舉制度，改進目前的敎育制度的理由。學習的方針既定，方法也得確當，「只要工夫深，鐵杵固然可以磨成針，然而如果能够想法子先把鐵杵分成許多鐵錢，然後再來磨針，豈不事半功倍？」（二十三頁）由此可知學習固需埋首苦幹，也得運用技巧，本書的最後一章最後一段話，著者綜合了「學習方法論」與「學習論」的精髓，頗足發人猛省：</p>
<p>「……學習方法原是前人從辛苦中得來的經騐，這種經騐……足使我們增加學習的効率……學習是「實踐」，學習方法是「理論」，理論經實踐中產生，然後又轉而去指導實踐……學習是主，學習法是從；學習在前，學習法在後。因此……大家得應用了最好的方法去作最善的努力。只是「臨淵羨魚，不如退而結網」，假使侈談方法而不肯認眞下工夫去學習，則毋寗先學習而把方法丟開！」</p>
<p>這實是對在學習道路上行進的朋友們幾句極好的箴言。</p>
<p>由於偭人自私心的驅使，就有許多不良的心理的產生，這些不良心理，往往都是學習上的蟊賊，著者在第六章「酸葡萄與甜。檸檬」中例舉了幾種牢牢大者：除了推諉掩飾自欺欺人的强辯或託詞心理外，他如阿Q吃了趙公子一杖而與王　尋　，打王友　不過乃跟尼姑開玩笑的「代巷」；侏儒走路挺胸突肚，醜婦化粧塗脂抹粉的「補償」；明明物質文明落後却侈言祖先精神文明的「退轉作用」等，都是極通常而又極要不得的心理。要免除這些不良心理，便需常保樂觀的心境，客觀的態度與良好的環境，這也就是講求心理衛生的三要素。</p>
<p>對於學習曲線，一通百通說的謬論記誦之學的流毒，本書都有充分的闡發。並且還糾正了平常蔑視成人學習能力的錯誤觀念—認爲人生一過兒童與靑年時代，就喪失了好奇心，腦力，同化力而不再有學習的能力。固然從上流社會年長者口裏的「世風日下」「人心不古」這一類的嘆息中可以表明這一羣老先生不再在繼續向新的事物學習而終日迷戀在往日的骸骨裏，然而這一種觀念只是一種積非成是，習焉不察的見解，根據現代心理學的實騐，從二十歲到五十歲，這期間人的學習興趣均未减低，俗語「學到老學不了」，列寧的「學習學習再學習」，再徵之許多「大器晚成」的偉人們，更可見得成年學習的能力不衰落。多少社會上往往聽到年未四十的人，都滿口老了不中用了，這種惡現象，實非　除不可，著者在本書裏告訴了我們這種惡現象的不可靠找到了科學根據。</p>
<p>總之，本書確是一本有益於心地的好書，可是書中雖然引了不少淺近的例子，但仍舊有太多的敎育上心理學上的專門名詞，開明書店既然把它編爲靑年叢書的一種，通常的中學生對於這些不兌稍微要惑到頭痛，因而减低對本書閱讀的興趣，希望著者在第五版時能加以改進。</p>
<h3>談「戰綫」裏的將軍</h3>
<p>— 若非</p>
<p>「戰綫」，是久已聞各了的一個劇本，記得還是兩年前吧，邵力子先生使蘇歸國，就爲何應欽將軍帶來了這本書，前者是受了後者之託的，當時戰事還在全國蔓延，敵人在各地集結重兵，頗有打通亞洲大陸之企圖。「戰錢」這本書在當時中國是應該有點敎育作用的吧？惜乎在那時候我們還看不到譯本。</p>
<p>柯爾納楚克是蘇聯著名劇作家，他的處女劇作是「烏克蘭草原」，一本喜劇，描寫烏克籣鄉村生活，少男少女的牧歌式的戀愛。「戰綫」是他的第四個劇本，主題是在暴露蘇聯舊式軍閥的剛愎自用，與若干低級戰鬥員與指揮員的英勇。</p>
<p>這是一個對照；一方面是鬥士們的勇敢地克服死之恐懼，一個強固集團所籠罩着的同志協和的精神，新的將領奧格烏夫是如何地戰鬥過來，終於取沒落者而代之；另一方面則是不知抓住時代，不知學習，保守自私，有強大的誇張癖的戰綫司令——伊凡，戈凡戈爾洛夫——他的「健談」無補於戰鬥，甚至造成了種種錯誤和犧牲，結局是是被命撤職，將司令印緩移交給他所最看不起的越級擢昇的奧格烏夫。</p>
<p>柯爾納楚克所寫的是典型人物，他並不是以一個特定的人，特定的的境爲描對象，他的模特兒是衆多的，不過經過了他的刪節，强調，整理，他於是創造出若干典型人物：如沒落的舊式將領戈爾洛夫，如機警明敏的軍事委員蓋達爾，如新一代的人物奧格烏夫，如懦弱誤事因循坐待的偵察部部長吳奇維兒利達，如好誇大的新聞記者克利孔等。</p>
<p>「戰綫」的出版，在蘇聯也頗轟動一時，因爲它大阻地抨擊了舊式的將領，而這些將領却是往年久經戰陣，有赫赫功績的人物。因此在蘇聯，對「戰綫」的看法也分成了兩派，一派是贊同作者的看法，認爲合理的批評較之掩飾與選而不談爲佳，盧那卡爾斯基說：「能批評自己的，決不會有由於批評而招致毁滅的命運」，這是他們所服應的眞理；另一派則責備作者過分誇張，似乎他太誇張了否定人物的無知，懦法，盧僞。這情形大約各國皆然，問題只是一個：「黑暗應不應該暴露」。有人反對，以爲家醜不可外揚，有人贊成，以爲不暴露也無從改革。從文藝工作者說，他無論所站的是什麼立塲，他是應該贊同後者的。老舍說：「一提起筆就得像一個小偷似的東張西望」，在這樣的寫作情形下，就根本不可能產生「戰綫」似的作品。</p>
<p>故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>戈爾洛夫是舊時代的英雄，在蘇聯建國時代頗立下了些汗馬功勞，德蘇戰爭爆發，他自然照樣祖起重任，當了戰綫司令。然而無可懷疑的，這老人的腦袋多少有點毛病，他好回憶過去，常常對年靑人說：「你認爲什麼？你對於軍事速二乘二都不知道，當我們在輾轉打仗的時候，你還在吸你媽的奶奶呢。……」之類的話。</p>
<p>戈爾洛夫是一個老英雄，我們是承認的。可是「老」不是一種戰退敵人的武器，唯有自强不息，時時前進，學習，這才是擊退敵人的唯一武器。戈爾洛夫的失敗處是他太剛愎自用。知道兒子戰死了，他沒有哭，這是他的英雄性格的流露；但知道奧格烏夫因不邀守他的命令而獲勝了時，他反暴跳如雷，這也是個人英雄主義者必然有的現象。</p>
<p>在討論戰略和戰術時，戈爾洛夫好大言，說空話，每當被奧格烏夫成其他的人駁倒了時，他的唯一辦法便是維持自己戰綫司令的尊巖，不顧一切，斷然下一些莫明其妙的命令。</p>
<p>戈爾洛夫在劇尾終於道出一句眞實話：「我要改正奧格烏夫們的腦袋」。是的，「改正腦袋」是一切創造的根基，不過，這所謂應加改造不是奧格鳥夫，倒是保守自私的好說大話的戈爾洛夫自己。</p>
<p>全劇用的是諷刺喜劇的手法，續後的印象很深，演起來也許更會感動人吧。</p>

<h3>聖誕與世風</h3>
<p>— 疚堂</p>
<p>歲望云暮，聖　已屆，火鷄入市，禮品　窓，炫耀奪目之銀屑銀星，與數十百千萬之標價，並足以怵目驚心，歡悅之情，實在抵不住艱難之歎。大公司之聖誕發票，不能售至千五百張，因而有點不寫意，固尙其次者也。</p>
<p>爲什麼必須過聖誕？孔子的誕辰，屈原殉國，乃至觀者菩薩生日，好像都沒有這麼熱鬧，然則十里洋塲之遊當中心，固可謂無往而不洋矣。就是在觀音大士面前燒香念大悲咒的朋友，只要心有餘而力尙非不足，亦必徜徉於三大公司，買聖誕禮物以敬其所不能不敬之朋友或上司，耶穌地獄之說，富人難進天國之論，殆根本不必計及。這也就是說，聖誕在中國之意義，與中秋新年將毋同，作生意的賺錢，有錢的大老官花錢，而其對象有二，自己的肚皮和要拍的馬屁。</p>
<p>我不反對聖誕，反對者，連Santa　Claus也是勢利小人耳。戰爭的結果，必是生計困難，因而引起道德的普遍淪喪，造成一切都反常的現象。在中國這也是數見不一見了，不過學了聊齋志異的說法，「自古已然，於今爲甚」，這程度可眞正空前了。張端義貴耳集有云：</p>
<p>「古今治天下多有所尙，唐虞尙德，夏尙功，商尙老，周尙親，秦尙刑法，漢尙材謀，東漢尙節義，魏尙辭章，晋尙淸淡，周隋尙族望，唐尙制度文華，本朝尙法律議論。」</p>
<p>此所云雖有的不合邏輯，但說秦漢以來的特色是很不差的，吳哈君引用此文於他的論「社會風氣」一文，隨後就說民國以來所尙在「革」，晚近十年來，所尙在「利」，自然這是很感慨，然也是事實。不過就我的看法，「革」只是少數人的事，而利則自淸代中華以來，業已蔚然成風，不可救藥了。只是這利字還嫌不够具體，因爲還可以包括了功利主義Pragmatism及利他精神在內，中國完全是自私自利，與其說是利，還不如改爲「私」字。</p>
<p>童話中聖誕老人乃是賞善罰惡的，並不專找那有壁爐有溫暖的烟囪冉冉而下，像中國這許多造孽的人，正該在他們的襪子裘擺兩只靑蛙或老鼠。至於第二代的小兒，往往不出家庭即已薰了銅臭與權勢，聖誕老人不來倒也罷了，不要讓風和雪專門打擊賣火柴的小女兒，公子哥兒也該嚐　才是。</p>
<h3>聖誕老人的來源</h3>
<p>— 維我</p>
<p>一八二二年十二月二十四日下午，摩爾博士（Dr．Clement　ClarkeMoore）很高興地急急回家。那天他很早就離開了他所執敎的紐約神學院，因爲他將要爲孩予們寫一首「聖誕幻想詩」，那時候，皚皚白雪正飛舞着。</p>
<p>他愉快地自言自語的說：「今天看來的確像是聖誕節的氣景。我要央求凱塞玲和孩子們讓我一個人靜思一個鐘頭，來完成那一首幻想詩。」</p>
<p>於是一個鐘頭以後，那首詩便寫好了。</p>
<p>大家祈　完畢，接着便是一頓豐美的晚餐。慘後，摩爾坐在火爐勞的皮椅裏，孩子們爬上他的滕　。他的太太凱塞玲坐在近旁一張算背睡椅上－正是一個完美的聖誕夜！</p>
<p>「我爲了你們帶來一個小玩意兒－一篇聖誕故事。」摩爾向孩子們說：</p>
<p>「這是聖誕節的前夜，整個屋子沒有一點聲響。那時，許多長統襪子都掛在烟囱邊上，</p>
<p>在等候聖尼古拉的來臨。……</p>
<p>孩子們屛息地傾聽他們父親響亮而沉重的聲音。他說：</p>
<p>「——這是一個從睡夢中被驚醒的孩子所講的故事；他跳下了床，伸目張望着月光皎潔白雪皚皚的窗外：</p>
<p>眼簾中隱約出現了</p>
<p>一個小老兒。</p>
<p>他驅着八隻小馴鹿拉的小　車，</p>
<p>又迅速又活潑地進來。</p>
<p>我知道，這就是聖尼古拉！</p>
<p>他眞是一位令人驚異的朋友呵！他竟能帶着許多玩具飛過屋頂，又從陝隘的烟囪裏下來。</p>
<p>「從有一張圓圓的臉，一個隆起的肚皮，</p>
<p>當他笑的時候，肚子像鉢頭裏的漿液在攪動。」</p>
<p>孩子們請求摩爾再重覆地給他們聽；他們似給這「聖尼古拉的拜訪」AVisit　from　StNicholas）所迷惑了。</p>
<p>然而，次日　位可敬的教授便把它塞進抽屜，和舊文稿混在一塊，早已遺忘了它。但他的太太暗暗地把牠抄下來，去寄給了特洛衛報的編輯，次年十二月二十三日，這首詩被刋載出來了。</p>
<p>全世界所有的報章雜誌都爭着刋載這首詩。兒童書籍，學校敎本也選用了牠。這一種讀者的反應使摩爾驚駭不置。比這更動人的是，它已變了聖誕節慶典的習俗。</p>
<p>小馴鹿，聖尼古拉，長統襪……這些眾人所熱知的聖誕節特色，都是處於摩爾奇妙的詩篇。他似給了世人一幅愉快的圖畫，他使成千成萬的孩子們起了夢幻，引起了他們童年的回憶。</p>
<p>直到現在，出版者都認為「聖尼古拉的拜訪」是不朽之作。</p>
<p>摩爾所認為不足道德詩，卻在其後一百二十五年中被孩子們　美着。雖然他他不曾因此一點點的酬報，然而那快樂的聖誕老人卻與世不朽，永遠是孩子們的朋友了！</p>

<h3>開拓生路</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>一九四七年的日曆，很快就要撕完了，這一年，世　紛紜，驚心動魄，我已疲勞於應付，失去沉思的閒暇，不僅不能記得那些事不關已的瑣事，就是自己曾做過些什麼，也都茫茫然了。在我的生命歷程裘，又算是留下一頁空白。</p>
<p>閒來每事，翻翻秦本紀，看到贏政在滅六國，一四海之後，便建築奢華絕代的阿房宮，當自已還在盛年，即預吿　山的墳墓，並假托方士盧生的神話：「亡秦者胡也」，以訛傳訛，說是北胡人要來滅亡中國，馬上頒發天下壯丁，實施空前的國防計劃－趕　萬里長城。他爲什麼要在六國剛剛蕩平，不與民休息，就來大興土木呢？實在是由於無法收拾六國的兵馬。六國雖然滅亡，而六國爭戰動員的壯丁，已到飽和點，這在秦國也是一樣，不得不想想主意，於是，祗有大興土木之一法了。</p>
<p>在這一段史實中，可以看出先秦的政治家們，的確是聰明的，他們知道戰後失業問題的重要，知道這些退伍的兵卒，如果無事可做，有力無處用，便可爲少數野心家所利用的，當作爭權奪利的工具。可惜他們不應該大　土木，　宮殿，造　墓，儘管那些成年的壯丁，已精疲力竭，不會造反作亂，可是，消耗國庫，浪費民力，以致陷天下於空前的困窮，也是滅亡的主因。假使，他們能盡驅這些退伍的壯丁於生產的戰綫，屯庄，栽樹，種桑，義蠶，不築長城，而趕修在秦時就開始爲患的黃河，不造阿房宮及　山的墳墓，而專於利用七國的壯丁，開　荒地，那麼，贏秦的國寳，縱不能傳之萬世，但不至於二世而亡，是可以斷言據·</p>
<p>前事不忘，後事之師，從明年起，我希望大家多做有益於「國計民生的工作，廣拓生活的道路，讓大家都能憑自己的能力，找到活命的資源。祗要有一拨一藝的人，都能展其所長，盡其所能，交換應得的代價，支持最低限度的生活，不至於到處碰壁，走頭無路，或被迫走險，跑到死路上去。</p>
<p>從明年起，我希望每一個中國人都能做一件生產的工作，來塡寫自己的生活史，倘不能開礦築路，就是在明年的植樹節大家栽一棵樹，也有四億七千萬株，將來茂樹成蔭，旣可壯觀瞻，也是國家一筆　大的財富，豈不勝於遊手好閒，空言無補－離開生產，便無生路，生產重於一切－萬不可在修衛門，造花園，榮華市容，擴充會塲，娛樂塲，隆重宴請國內外的大賓……等等不生產的工作上，無限止地浪費人力和物力；雖然也能使少數人忙於這些不急之務，吃飽自己的肚，而國家與人民必更趨於可怕的貧困。</p>

<p>林太太一到房內，惡狠狠伸手先打　一耳光。福田見太太一進房便動手，急放下　執把太太攔腰抱住，口襄喊道：「綺紈，快走！快走！」綺紈吃了眼前虧，見林太太蠻不講理，情知不敵，房門首又圍了許多人，怕逃不出，急由洗澡間小門溜出。林太太見綺紈逃走，那肯干休，一時給福田緊緊抱住，掙扎不出，急得張開大口，向福田手臂上猛咬三口，福田似覺得狗咬一般痛，兩手一鬆，林太太竟掙扎出來，隨手拾起一根鷄毛撣，追逐出來，口裏大喊：「那裏跑－你們把大門堵住！」綺紈見大門出不去，急由旁門逃出。林太太率領衆人，也尾逐出來，逼得綺紈走頭無路，要投水自盡，在此千鈞一髮之際，恰遇渚齋前來，解了軍圍。當時渚齋再三問綺紈，「爲的什麼事？」她只哭着不肯說，祗喊「你放我走吧！放我走吧！」渚齋很誠懇地說道：「別說是你，就是一個陌生路人，遇見這情形，我也要援救。」綺紈道：「我不需要援救，我命不好，死了乾凈！」渚齋道：「這種黑暗社會，沒理可講，你不要難過，我送你……」渚齋話還還沒說完，綺紈早喊道：「我不回去，沒臉回去！」渚齋見她額上手臂上，不住沁出鮮血，急改口道：「當然不能回去，我送你到醫院去。」綺紈道：「我也不去！我給人打了，給醫生知道，太難堪了！」渚齋道：「沒有吿訴他必要，祗說在車上摔下受了傷，好嗎？」渚齋一面說，一邊拉着她上土坡，那老車夫，因爲渚齋半路跳下車，沒給車錢，還守在土坡旁邊，見渚齋攙着一人上來，急把車拉近，渚齋挽了綺紈上車，吩咐車夫，拉到仁民醫院，多給車資。車夫一聽多給錢，很興奮地拿起車把，小跑幾步，終因年邁無力，又慢呑吞走着，渚齋扶在車旁，跟着走，吿訴綺紈，仁民醫院有位魏大夫，是他好友，就住在醫院內，先請他看看。這仁民醫院，離十刹海並不遠，不一會工夫，渚齋望見一座小小紅磚砌的小樓，門口那　白色荔枝式的燈泡，上面畫着紅十半，遠晶亮着，在這幽僻的地方，萬　俱寂中，這一　白色紅十字電燈，很是耀眼。渚齋吿訴車夫，往電燈那座小樓拉去，到得門口，渚齋拿出名片，交開門的聽差遞進去，一面攙着綺紈下車，扶進待診室。</p>

<h3>Government Order to Convene the National Assembly - To Be Held on March 29th Next Year - Term of Office for Senators Extended by Three Months</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The National Government issued an order on the 25th: In accordance with the report submitted by the Election Affairs Office, as of December 24th, 2,042 representatives to the National Assembly have been elected, exceeding two-thirds of the total number. This has been reported to the government. Now, in accordance with Articles 5 and 8 of the Preparatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Constitution, the National Assembly will be convened on March 29th of the 37th year of the Republic (1948). All representatives must personally register at the National Assembly in Nanjing before the meeting begins. This order is hereby issued. The term of office for the fourth session of the National Political Council members is extended to March 28th of the 37th year of the Republic (1948). This order is hereby issued.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the General Election Committee, prepared a document on the afternoon of the 24th, compiling and reporting to the National Government the elected National Assembly representatives from various regions. The report reached the National Government at 2 PM, with a total of 2,042 representatives reported.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The National Government has decided to issue the National Assembly Convening Order on the 25th, announcing the date of the National Assembly session and commencing constitutional governance. In addition to issuing a general order for the entire country to raise flags in celebration, the government does not plan to hold any other ceremonies. However, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee, established after the closing of the Constitutional National Assembly, is scheduled to hold its anniversary celebration at 3 PM on the 25th to mark the beginning of constitutional governance. Chairman Sun Ke, Vice Chairman Xu Chuanlin, Mo Dehui, and others will attend. It is reported that the main purpose of the anniversary celebration on the 25th is solely for celebration, but some members may raise questions regarding the future of the committee itself during the meeting. According to the committee's organizational regulations, the committee should conclude its work on the day the Constitutional National Assembly is convened. However, some committee members are currently planning to reorganize it, changing the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee into the Constitutional Advancement Association. Whether this will be approved by the authorities is currently unknown.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Constitutional governance will begin on the 25th, marking exactly one year since the closing of the Constitutional National Assembly. This reporter specifically visited Xu Chuanlin, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party's government, on the evening of the 24th to ask for his views on constitutional governance. Xu stated: "With the beginning of constitutional governance, we deeply hope that all matters can grasp reality and adopt a practical approach to ensure the fundamental success of democratic constitutionalism." Regarding the date of the National Assembly convocation, Xu expressed hope that it could be convened as soon as possible. He also expressed hope for current politics to start with refreshing local politics, thoroughly reforming local government people, and achieving the recovery of people's hearts, so that the country will have its own future.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The National Assembly Candidate Nomination Association held a meeting at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at 10 AM on the 24th, inviting Central Standing Committee members, legislators, senators, constitutional assembly members, and members of the Constitutional Council to report their opinions on the current elections. They also issued a declaration, clarifying the association's position, while expressing support for the leader, upholding the constitution, and protecting civil rights.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Renowned political figure Dr. Wang Chonghui stated when meeting with reporters on the morning of the 24th: "The Christmas season marks the beginning of constitutional governance in our country. This move will be a genuine challenge by the National Government to the Chinese Communists' slogan of a 'democratic government,' because the facts prove that the Chinese Communists' slogan is actually a pretext for their rebellious nature, confusing domestic and international audiences. The only path towards democracy lies in the drafting and implementation of a new constitution, but the Chinese Communists refuse to participate in both of these tasks. They constantly clamor for a democratic government, but in reality, what they are pursuing is the establishment of a communist dictatorship." Dr. Wang, an authority in Chinese law who has shouldered important tasks in the constitutional democracy movement for the past two or three decades, recently arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. Dr. Wang stated: "This new era will guarantee to all citizens the freedoms under the constitution. The people will enjoy these freedoms in accordance with the constitution and within the scope of the law." Wang stated that the current provisional government will be reorganized in accordance with the constitution, and in the future, the two most important departments of the government—the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan—will be entirely elected by the people, so that these two bodies are based on the will of the people. Dr. Wang also pointed out that the future Premier of the Executive Yuan will be responsible to the legislative body, which is the mouthpiece of the people, and that all administrative measures will be guided by the chapter on basic national policies in the constitution. Wang stated: "The most important administrative policy of our country's new constitutional government is to develop local autonomy based on the constitution and relevant laws." After learning about the number of elected National Assembly representatives, Wang expressed deep satisfaction with the results of this election. He said: "On the whole, this election is indeed a success, as this is the first time that our people have used the right to vote to participate in elections."</p>
<h3>First Batch of U.S. Relief Flour - Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of This Year - Full Distribution of Materials to Begin Next Spring</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling U.S. Relief Supplies is actively promoting the distribution of relief materials in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. In addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan for approval to establish U.S. Relief Material Distribution Committees in each of the aforementioned five cities, with the mayors of each city serving as the chairman of the distribution committee and representatives from the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Social Affairs (one person each), and the City Council (two people), the approved distribution methods have been sent to the five city governments for implementation. Relief materials will mainly consist of food. Once this food arrives in China, it will be distributed to the five cities to participate in each city's overall distribution plan. The scope of distribution targets and prices will still be formulated by the five city governments based on environmental needs and submitted for approval before implementation. The first batch of relief flour is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this year. Miu Jiaming, the chairman of the committee, has been in Nanjing and Shanghai for several days to coordinate the various necessary measures. The overall reception of materials upon arrival in Shanghai will be handled by the Shanghai Office established by the committee, while the storage and transportation of materials will be entrusted to the Ministry of Transportation's General Storage and Transportation Office. The Nanjing Municipal U.S. Material Distribution Committee was formally established on the 24th. In the afternoon, a joint meeting was held with the Executive Yuan Committee in the conference room of the National Economic Commission. Attending Executive Yuan Committee members included Chairman Miu Jiaming, Committee members Tao Yuchuan, Zheng Daochu, Huang Bodu, Guan Jiyu, and Jin Baoshan. Municipal Committee members included Chairman Shen Yi, Committee members Jiang Menglin, Zhou Yiguang, and Xie Weifu. They discussed all matters related to the preparation for distribution. It is reported that the committee plans to begin distribution in February of next year, after U.S. materials arrive in succession. [Please refer to page four]</p>
<h3>U.S. Long-Term Aid to China Plan - To Be Submitted to Congress for Discussion Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 24th, Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, U.S. Under Secretary of State Lovett stated at a press conference today that the State Department will submit a long-term aid to China plan when Congress convenes on January 6th.

After the meeting, the board's new chairman, former U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, McNutt, issued a policy statement, stating: "The 1948 plan includes maintaining existing programs in China for child welfare, health, and medicine, and will expand the work of some of the seven agencies. Funding will be raised in February through the American Overseas Aid Campaign and the United Nations Relief for Children Fund, the latter being a new joint organization that includes all aid to China efforts. United China Relief is the largest private aid organization for China in the United States, and its goal is to help China achieve self-reliance."</p>

<h3>Communist Bandits in Central Hubei Flee to the Jingmen Zao City Area - Communist Bandits in Eastern Henan Invade Ningling and Fugou - Remnant Bandits in the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng-Xuchang Triangle Area Under Siege</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] Military News: The Communist 12th Column and Luo Houding's bandit forces in Central Hubei, after being intercepted by the National Army, fled back to the Jingmen Zao City area on the 23rd and destroyed highways east of Zao City. Regrettably, the Communist 10th Column of Zhou Chan in Zaoyang has fled north towards the vicinity of Xinye. The Communist 1st Column that fled back to Xixian County in southern Henan crossed the Ru River and fled north on the 22nd. In addition, the main force of the Communist 3rd Column and a part of the 6th Column are attempting to invade Lihuang. According to the Railway Bureau: The recapture of Zhumadian has been completely secured, and the National Army is advancing towards Suiping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 24th] The National Army in eastern Henan recovered Ningling County and Fugou on the afternoon of the 23rd. In addition, the National Army that was suppressing bandits from the northeast of Suixian County successively captured strongholds such as Diqiumiao, Wangshanmazhuang, and Heshanglou on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] After capturing Ningling on the 22nd, the National Army in eastern Henan continued to pursue and annihilate the remnants of Chen Yi's Communist 10th Column, achieving substantial victories in the past two days, killing nearly a thousand bandits. One table, one local volunteer group person</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 24th] The main force of Chen Yi's Communist 1st and 4th Columns is still in the Zhengzhou-Kaifeng-Xuchang triangle area, and is currently being besieged and suppressed by the National Army attacking from Zhengzhou and the National Army advancing west from Zha County. The bandit forces are showing signs of collapse. The Zhengzhou Special Commissioner's Office ordered the county governments and teams under its jurisdiction to quickly enter the county boundaries. On the evening of the 23rd, the Changge County Magistrate moved into the county seat, and the Weishi and Yuchuan County Magistrates also entered the county boundaries.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Luoyang, 24th] The National Army that advanced east from Lushi arrived in Luoyang on the 20th, and motorcades also arrived in Luoyang from Shaanxi in a steady stream, so that transportation between Shaanxi and Henan was completely unimpeded.</p>
<h3>Authorities Consider Establishing a Structure Similar to the Senate - To Place Unsuccessful Legislative and Supervisory Committee Members, etc.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] It is learned that the authorities are considering providing appropriate placements for incumbent Legislative Committee members, Supervisory Committee members, Senators, and Constitutional Promotion Committee members who have failed in their elections, i.e., establishing a civil constitutional structure similar to but not the same as the Senate. If this method is finalized by the authorities, it can be implemented. To date, the authorities have consulted with members of these four institutions several times and reached tacit agreement, so there is great hope for its formation.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou City Circulating Hong Kong Dollars - Ministry of Finance Orders Suppression</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] Recently, a most absurd trend has become popular in Guangzhou, namely, citizens disregarding domestic currency and favoring foreign currency. Currently, all buying, selling, renting, lending, and other transactions or contracts are calculated and paid in Hong Kong dollars. Even ordinary civil servants are exchanging their salaries for Hong Kong dollars and storing them. The Ministry of Finance has ordered the Guangzhou City Government to strictly prohibit the use of foreign currency, and the City Government has instructed the police bureau to earnestly implement this order. However, whether this can be completely eradicated, given the close ties with Hong Kong, is a real problem.</p>
<h3>Dong XianGuang's Remarks - If Feng Yuxiang is Loyal to the Country, He Should Immediately Obey Orders to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Director Dong XianGuang commented on the news that Feng Yuxiang claimed to the press in the United States that Chairman Jiang ordered him to return home, while President Zhang ordered him to remain in the United States to study water conservancy issues, stating: "Feng Yuxiang had requested the government in May of this year to allow him to continue staying in the United States for another year. The Executive Yuan prepared the necessary expenses for one year, signed and submitted them to the National Government for approval, and paid half of the amount. President Zhang replied to Feng in writing. This happened several months ago. Recently, the government felt that Feng did not need to continue staying in the United States, so it ordered him to return home. The two matters are sequential and do not conflict." Dong also stated that Feng had told American reporters that because the government orders conflicted, he was awaiting further instructions to determine his itinerary. In fact, the government orders did not conflict, as mentioned above. Feng initially went abroad on assignment from Chairman Jiang. Now that Chairman Jiang, as the head of the government, has ordered him to return home, Feng should obey the order if he is loyal to the country.</p>

<h3>Zheng Dongguo Arrives in Beiping from Nanjing - Claims Northeast Situation Will Develop - Zhangwu Unveils the Prelude to a Main Battle</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Zheng Dongguo, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, recently arrived in Nanjing to report on defense matters to the authorities and request instructions. He has now completed his official duties and left Nanjing by special plane at 10 AM on the 24th to fly to Beiping and then to Pan. Before leaving, Zheng told reporters about the war in the Northeast, saying: "The establishment of the North China Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters will greatly help the war effort within the passes. If the communists can be eliminated first, then the National Army can concentrate on the Northeast, and eliminating the bandits in the Northeast will be as easy as turning one's hand." Zheng also said about the current situation of the bandits in the Northeast: "There are approximately 500,000 to 600,000 communists in the Northeast, with approximately one hundred aircraft. However, they have never used aircraft in combat. In addition, the recent seventh communist raid was only to damage the North Manchuria Railway and seize materials and cannot be called an offensive." However, Zheng stated that the Northeast needs more troops and ammunition and that the National Army will strive to take the initiative to attack the communists.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 24th] Zheng Dongguo arrived in Beiping by plane from Nanjing at 2 PM on the 24th. He is scheduled to fly to Pan on the 25th. Zheng visited Li Zongren at 3 PM this afternoon. When he met reporters at the headquarters, he said: "The purpose of going to Nanjing was solely to report on military affairs in the Northeast and to listen to instructions. Chairman Jiang understands the situation in the Northeast in great detail. There is definitely no problem in the Northeast. The communists launching an offensive in the severe winter will benefit them in no way." Zheng then answered two questions from reporters: The Northeast needs troops from within the passes to reinforce it, and the central government is prepared to do so. However, from a military point of view, Jilin and Changchun are not that important. Even if they are abandoned, it will not affect the overall situation, and even if they are abandoned today, they can be recovered tomorrow, but there is no need to abandon them now. Zheng finally said: "The situation in the Northeast is developing in a new way. It is only a matter of time. There will be no shortage of food, and coal can be obtained locally." [Our Newspaper, Luoyang, 24th] The prelude to the main battle in the northwest area of Shenyang began in Zhangwu on the 23rd.

On the 24th, a part of the Communist 9th Column joined forces with the 4th Column harassing the area between Liaoyang and Shahe. The 4th Column also attacked Liaozhong on the 23rd with two divisions and was captured by the bandits at night. The junction of the 4th and 9th Columns, with Shenyang and Xinmin as a triangle, is also of great importance. The reinforcements from within the passes, Hou Jingru's forces, have left the passes and will guard Jinzhou and attack the bandits' rear.

<h3>Communist Bandits Plan to Borrow Soviet Military Force - Secret Plot to Seize Power - "Military and Political Cadre Conference" Agrees on Steps</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 24th] The Communist bandits believe that the Third World War is about to break out and attempt to borrow the Soviet military force to seize power. They are secretly preparing in the base areas. According to Liu Jing'an, a member of the Communist Party's Fengyu County Senate who surrendered to the National Army on the front line in northern Shanxi: On November 18, the Communist Party opened an enlarged meeting of military and political cadres in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in Dongxindian, five miles north of Yuanyuan City, with more than 3,000 people attending. Luo Ruiqing, Dong Biwu, Liu Zihou, and others from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party presided over the meeting, which closed on December 2. The political report stated: "The tide of democratic revolution has arrived. The only thing the Communist Party relies on is the Soviet Red Army. It is estimated that the Red Army can provide 500,000 to 1 million in assistance to the Communist Party. The Third World War will be decided in the Northeast. The first step is for the Soviet army to hide within the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, launching an offensive in the Northeast to defeat the U.S., while simultaneously dispatching troops from Xinjiang and rapidly controlling the entire area north of the Yangtze River. The Communist army crossing south of the Yangtze River will be controlled by the Soviet army. If the situation deteriorates, it will completely control all manpower and materials south of the Yangtze River, implementing a scorched earth policy, making the entire area north of the Yangtze River desolate, even if the U.S. military lands and occupies it, it will make it extremely difficult. We must thoroughly overthrow landlords, rich peasants, and intellectuals. Those who have worked in the government will be purged, and those with errors in their thinking and behavior will also be purged. They have already rushed to build highways and hoard food."</p>

<h3>Direct Tax Threshold to be Raised Next Year</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] According to news from the Direct Tax Administration, the collection of direct taxes this year is proceeding smoothly.

However, in recent years, prices have risen consistently across the country, and the currency has depreciated repeatedly.

<h3>Business Tax Halved for National Defense and Livelihood Manufacturing Industries</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Business Tax and Implementation Rules stipulate that the business tax for manufacturing industries is halved, but only for those related to national defense or people's livelihood. The Ministry of Finance has now listed the manufacturing industries eligible for this halving separately: Those related to national defense include factories for coking coal, petroleum, diesel, spirits, smelting, power, machinery, cement, rubber, chemical products, acids, alkalis, salts, and scientific instruments. Those related to people's livelihood include factories for wheat, flour, cotton, silk, textiles, sugar, leather, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, shipbuilding operations, toolmaking, papermaking, fertilizer, cooking oil, and motor vehicles. The above-mentioned factories should not pay factory exit tax or production tax according to regulations, but if they wholesale their manufactured goods on the factory premises, the wholesale portion of the business tax is still subject to the full tax because it is the same as the retail nature of the manufacturers. In addition, the taxation of cotton yarn was originally based on a unit of 100 kilograms. Now, because the Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulates that the packaging unit is one large package weighing 400 pounds, equivalent to 181.44 kilograms, the Ministry of Finance, in order to facilitate tax verification, has re-stipulated that from the first period of tax assessment in the 37th year, the taxation of cotton yarn will be uniformly changed to a unit of each large package. In special circumstances where the prescribed packaging is exceeded or falls short, those weighing four hundred pounds at the end of the seven-year period must have the exceeded or insufficient portion increased or decreased proportionally according to the tax rate set for each large package. They are still ordered to pack according to the prescribed weight to ensure uniformity within a limited time.</p>

<h3>Editorial: The Glorious Beginning of Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic of China will be implemented starting today. The Constitutional National Assembly of last year has already made a resolution, and the National Government has also issued a clear order. From now on, the country will enter the normal track of constitutional government. The Kuomintang will be able to realize its long-cherished wish of returning power to the people, and the people will be able to fulfill their eager hope for governance. Therefore, December 25, 1947, is an important watershed in the history of the Chinese nation. On the occasion of the beginning of constitutional government, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, there is a sincere desire to express a few points to congratulate:</p>
<p>First of all, what we cannot fail to point out here is that the beginning of China's constitutional government coincides with the Christmas of the year 1947. The significance of this is extremely profound. In his broadcast speech on the eve of Christmas, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has clearly pointed out, he said: "When I think of Christmas this year, I think of the fact that we Chinese are going to start implementing a new democratic constitution on this festive day. I think this commemoration is very valuable. The 36th year of the Republic of China, that is, the Christmas of 1947, the year of the birth of Jesus, will be the day when our Republic of China and all the people will have a new opportunity for unity, independence, equality, and freedom. The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to give all our compatriots the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, personal respect and freedom." The day we begin to implement constitutional government coincides with Christmas, which is of great significance. It is not only an epoch-making event in our country's history, but also in human history. There is no more appropriate day for China to begin implementing constitutional government than December 25th: This is Christmas and the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. This is truly a glorious beginning for our country's constitutional government.</p>
<p>Reconstructed South Gate of Linyi City and Silhouette of Command Post on the City Wall (Special Correspondent Li Tian)</p>
<p>China is not a country that takes Christianity as its state religion, and we have no state religion; but the beginning of our constitutional government is on Christmas. For a non-Christian country to choose Christmas Day as the day to begin implementing constitutional government is epoch-making in human history. The birth of Jesus Christ brought new life to mankind. Since his birth, mankind can look forward to reaching the realm of eternal life. Because of the precious blood of Jesus, mankind can be cleansed of sins: hope arises from faith, and love arises from faith. Mankind has entered a new realm because of the birth of Jesus, gaining transcendence and liberation. The beginning of China's constitutional government on Christmas Day also signifies that the beginning of constitutional government can liberate China, transcend it, and enter a new realm. What is the new realm of transcendence and liberation for our country? It is the Kuomintang returning power to the people. From then on, the Republic of China has truly reached the realm of national politics by the people, of the people, and for the people; the fundamental law of the country has been implemented, and the implementation of the "rule of constitution" can be expected from now on. Just as the birth of Jesus strengthened our faith and gave rise to hope and love, the beginning of our country's constitutional government should also strengthen our confidence in the nation, the country, and even the entire world, and generate new hope from this confidence. What is this confidence? That is, no matter how bleak the current situation is, how chaotic the order is, and how turbulent the situation is, the future of the Chinese nation is still hopeful, and the future of the world is still bright.</p>
<p>What we should further point out is that China's constitution contains a rich Christian spirit. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek pointed out in his broadcast address: "The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to give all our compatriots the basic elements of Christian doctrine, namely, personal dignity and freedom." It can be seen that our country's constitution has many Christian elements and is a code that conforms to Christian doctrine and is sufficient to reflect the Christian spirit. It is a blessing for our nation to have such a fundamental law in a non-Christian country. This must be attributed to the spiritual inspiration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. As we weigh up the overall situation of the world, if the world is truly divided, then this division is definitely not a division between the East and the West, but will be a division between the Christian world and the non-Christian world. Non-Christian forces may be able to dominate for a while, but the result will inevitably be failure. Although the proportion of Christian believers in our country's total population is not high, this constitution with Christian spirit clearly indicates the direction we should take in the future. Although we are in the East, we do not recognize the division between East and West. Due to the implementation of this constitution, we have almost Christianized in terms of the fundamental law of the nation. Could there be a better day than Christmas for the implementation of this great law?</p>
<p>As we recall the painful experiences of the past 30 years, on the occasion of this constitutional government, as Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, this is the price we must pay. "If there were no painful and dark sides, there would be no happiness and light in life. We know that the country and the people have been truly refined in such painful suffering. Our pain has given us new vitality and experience, which will enable our country and nation to overcome all the current difficulties and must reach the end of victory. With this understanding and this belief, we can see Jesus Christ, who has gone through all kinds of hardships and finally achieved victory, standing in front of us, acting as a guiding light for our country and encouraging our new life." With Jesus Christ as our guiding light, we will not worry about darkness or hardships from now on. This is truly a glorious beginning for our constitutional government!</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Over the Past Year - Li Jinglu Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Li Jinglu, Director of the Air Transport Administration of the Ministry of Communications, recently met with reporters and talked about the improvements in civil aviation over the past year, stating briefly: This day last year was the most tragic day in the history of our country's civil aviation. Within five hours, three civil aviation planes crashed near Shanghai, killing 71 people. The Ministry of Communications was deeply saddened and decided to establish the Civil Aviation Administration to actively improve: 1. Unify flight navigation and command; 2. Improve equipment at airports across the country; 3. Improve aircraft radio equipment; 4. Increase weather observation equipment; 5. Stipulate airworthiness standards; 6. Add night navigation and landing equipment at important airports; 7. Strictly inspect aircraft parts; 8. Implement air traffic control for foreign aircraft entering the country; 9. Establish close ties with military airports; 10. Thoroughly reorganize personnel; 11. Train flight personnel and improve flight technology; 12. Increase the amount of passenger compensation and pensions and handle passenger safety insurance. In the future, it is hoped that civil aviation colleagues will continue to work hard to maintain a perfect safety record so that the painful lessons of this day last year will become a thing of the past forever.</p>
<h3>Dispute Between Shanghai Western Newspaper and Guild Unrelated to Freedom of the Press - Dong Xian Guang Explains at Press Conference</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Dong Xian Guang stated at a press conference on the 24th: Regarding the dispute between a Western newspaper in Shanghai and the Newspaper Guild over the allocation of paper quotas, some commentators abroad who do not understand the truth have made judgments that violate the facts, which is quite regrettable. I have now learned that an editorial in a New York newspaper stated that "The Chinese authorities are restricting the paper quota of newspapers that criticize the government as a way to restrict freedom of the press," and also stated that "If the Shanghai Evening Post is forced to stop publishing, then there will be no minimum amount of freedom of publication in China." Hong Kong newspapers also criticized this matter with the same tone. This kind of commentary is completely based on misunderstanding. The dispute over the allocation of paper arose from a resolution of the Shanghai Newspaper Guild. The Chinese government's problem with freedom of the press has nothing to do with the above-mentioned dispute. According to the current system, the government approves the paper quota for major cities, and then the local newspaper guilds decide on the quota for each newspaper. The guilds are free organizations of newspaper companies and are not subject to government control or influence. If member newspapers have disputes over guild resolutions, they can apply to the quota allocation office of the Import and Export Control Commission for a final decision. The dispute in Shanghai is the first incident since the implementation of the paper allocation system. After the government learned of this dispute, Minister Zhang Jia of the Import and Export Control Commission clearly informed the two Western newspapers and ordered the quota allocation office of the commission to conduct an investigation to seek a fair resolution of the incident. The occurrence of the incident is definitely not the result of the government suppressing freedom of the press. The Shanghai Evening Post knows this best. I would now like to quote an editorial from that newspaper, "Rash Judgments," to support my point. The newspaper stated: "When we were in dispute with the Newspaper Guild, we expressed our deep gratitude for the good intentions of the Hong Kong newspaper industry to support our position. At the same time, we must point out that the Hong Kong newspaper industry's belief that the Chinese government is ill-intentioned is probably wrong. We have both attacked the Chinese government, but we must also pay attention to the fact that the Chinese government has a considerable capacity to accept criticism and has no intention of controlling speech." The Shanghai Evening Post bravely corrected the erroneous concepts caused by this dispute overseas, and I am quite pleased!</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Inscribes Plaque and Awards It to Religious and Other Friendship Associations</h3>

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently commended the association and religious believers across the country, and specially inscribed the association with a plaque that reads "Prospering Education and Building the Nation."</p>
<h3>Personnel Choices for Three Post-Relief Institutions of the Executive Yuan Officially Announced</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] After the end of the China National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), the Executive Yuan decided to organize three institutions: the Post-Relief Affairs Commission, the Custody Commission, and the Post-Relief Materials Supply General Warehouse, to handle the unfinished matters of the CNRRA and UNRRA separately. It is learned that the personnel choices for the Custody Commission have been officially announced.

<h3>Reports of Liu's Bandits Fleeing to Sichuan are Inaccurate. The National Defense Ministry's News Bureau Releases Weekly War Situation.</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from Nanjing, this Newspaper, 24th] The spokesperson of the National Defense Ministry's News Bureau stated at a press conference on the 24th that the rumor about a faction of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops fleeing from western Hubei into Sichuan is inaccurate. This is because the number of Liu's bandits fleeing to western Hubei is less than 8,000. With the close cooperation of the national army and local civilian forces, it would be extremely difficult for them to realize their dream of crossing the dangerous Daba Mountains stealthily.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The National Defense Ministry's News Bureau released a statement on the 24th regarding the war situation for the week from December 17th to 23rd:</p>
<h3>Communist Bandit Raids in the Northeast Do Not Impede Anti-Bandit Military Operations</h3>
<p>In order to manipulate the deployment of the national army's forces and coordinate the flight of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Central Plains, the Northeast bandit army rashly launched raids before completing their reorganization and replenishment. Their main purpose was to destroy transportation and coal mines, and to obstruct the country's efforts to replenish and train troops. Since December 13th, the bandit army first used the 8th and 9th Columns of Li Qianlu's forces to destroy the Beining Railway and threaten Jinzhou. At the same time, the 2nd and 7th Columns of Huang Kecheng's forces in western Liaoning approached the area north of Kangping and Zhangwu. By the 16th, they were everywhere, attacking the weak points and exploiting gaps to launch raids. After the 17th, the bandit army on both sides of the Changchun Railway and the Beining Railway successively raided Heishan, Baiqibao, Xinlitun, Zhangwu, Faku, and the vicinity of Kanfosi north of Shenyang. The bandit army's 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 8th Columns on the east side of the Changchun Railway, and the 6th Column fleeing south from the Jichang Line, successively captured Changtu, the Yantai Coal Mine, and Dashiqiao, besieged the national army positions in Xinkaiyuan, Tiebei's Zhonggu, and Huagoufu northeast of Liaoyang. They also crossed the railway west through gaps near Changguo, Kaiyuan, and Yantai north of Liaoyang, attempting to capture Faku and Xinmin first, destroy transportation, and isolate Shenyang with the foreign troops northwest of Shenyang. Regarding the Communist bandits' risky raiding actions, in addition to giving them a head-on blow at Sanjiazi and Shahousuo south of Faku and Dashiqiao in southern Liaoning, killing and wounding about 6,000 officers and soldiers of the 2nd and 8th bandit columns, the national army also counterattacked from Siping, Liaoyang, Kaiyuan, Jinzhou, Zhangwu, and Kangping. By the 20th, the national army had recovered Shishan in western Liaoning, Beizhen, Yantai in Liaoyang, and Shifosi in northern Guan. The important locations of Jinzhou, Yixian, Beipiao, Zhangwu, Kangping, Kaiyuan, and Tieling are still under the control of the national army. Although the bandit army used more than 100,000 men to attack and disrupt Faku and Xinmin, and even repeatedly attacked, it was not enough to affect the national anti-bandit military operations, apart from destroying transportation, disrupting the lives and security of the people, and hindering the national army's reorganization and training.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's Bandit Factions are Defeated and Retreat</h3>
<p>In the Central Plains: The 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops launched a full-scale raid on the Zhengzhou-Xuchang triangle area last week. Under the national army's three-sided encirclement attack, they were forced to flee southeast from Xinzheng, Weishi, Tongxu, Chenliu, Qixian, and Lanfeng from the 15th onwards to avoid the national army's encirclement and suppression. Currently, the 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns have fled to the Liuhe and Minquan areas north of Ningling. The 6th Column fled to the northeast of Taiyuan, and the 1st, 3rd, and 4th Columns fled to the area between Fugou and Ningling. The national army is pursuing them in separate routes. Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Henan-Anhui-Hubei border area, because they are reluctant to leave their new nest in the Dabie Mountains, although they have suffered heavy losses under the national army's fierce attacks, they are still milling around and unwilling to leave the Dabie Mountains area easily. Therefore, after the 20th, they were attacked from the east and west by the national army. Their 2nd and 3rd Columns have retreated to the Lihuang and Yuexi areas. A part of the 6th Column retreated through the Popi River north of Fubei, while the main force climbed over the mountains and retreated to Yingshan. The 2nd Column was relentlessly pursued by the national army and could not return to the Dabie Mountains, so it is still lingering near Runanpu north of Xixian. As for the remnants of their 10th and 12th Columns, after suffering heavy losses, they fled westward in a hurry and retreated to the Dahong Mountains north of Jingshan and Xinye in Henan, wanting to establish the Jianghan Military Region and asking the poor farmers for food and clothing and implementing "liquidation" and "struggle."</p>
<h3>Chen Geng's Bandits in Western Henan are Being Encircled and Suppressed by the Military and Civilians, and Their Collapse is Accelerating</h3>
<p>The main force of Chen Geng's 9th Column in western Henan made a show of force last week to support Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi, wanting to flee from Minggang to Zhengyang. On the 18th, they stole into Queshan, plundered special resources, and kidnapped strong men. On the 20th, they fled west again. Their 4th Column and the 26th Brigade of the 9th Column raided Xuchang and Luohe on the 26th of this month. By the 20th, the national army from Zhengzhou moved south, the national army from southern Shaanxi moved east, and the national army from Luoyang encircled and suppressed them. The bandits had to retreat to their lair in the Funiu Mountains and echo the main force of the 38th Army near Luo, Chuandong, Jiuxian, and Checun. The national army has consolidated its foothold in the mountainous area. It is expected that under the joint encirclement and suppression of the military and civilians in that area, the bandits will inevitably collapse more rapidly.</p>

<h3>US-Iran Conclude New Agreement to Assist in Improving the Effectiveness of the Iranian Army. Agreement is Valid for One Year and Six Months.</h3>
<p>Iran is Not Allowed to Employ Military Advisors from Other Countries During this Period.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, New York, 23rd] According to its "open diplomacy policy," the United States has reported to the United Nations that it concluded an agreement with the Iranian government in Tehran in October of this year, stipulating that a US military team will assist in improving the effectiveness of the Iranian army. The agreement includes a clause stipulating that military experts from other foreign countries may not advise the Iranian army's affairs without the consent of the United States. The agreement is effective from October 6, 1947, to March 20, 1949, but the Iranian government may extend the agreement, and either of the signatory countries may terminate the validity of the agreement by notifying the other party in writing if necessary due to the development of the domestic and foreign situation. The mission of the US military team is to assist or provide opinions to the Iranian Isthmus Military Department and the Iranian General Staff Department on organization, management, and training methods. Strategic planning or combat planning against any foreign country is not within the scope of the mission of that country. US military team members may not hold command or staff positions in the Iranian army, but may, under the guidance of the head of the military team and with the consent of the Iranian Army Department, carry out inspection and investigation missions when necessary. The head of the military team and its members have the right to inspect any part of the Iranian military facilities, and the head of the department should provide inspection facilities and provide its records, plans, and communications. Military team members may not advise on confidential matters without the consent of the Iranian Army Department, and military team members may not disclose the secrets of the Iranian army to any other foreign government. The last clause of the agreement also states that during the validity of this agreement, the Iranian government may not employ personnel from any other foreign government to hold positions related to the Iranian army, unless with the consent of the US-Iranian government.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 23rd] State Department officials said that the agreement between the United States and Iran, which stipulates that the US military team will improve the effectiveness of the Iranian army, is only a continuation of the measures that have been in effect since 1942. The content of the new agreement is not much different from the original measures, and the number of US military personnel stationed in Iran will not increase.</p>
<h3>Agreement on Coal Production and Export Quotas in the Ruhr Area Reached by Britain, the United States, and France. France Obtains Half of the Amount Needed for its Steel Industry.</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Paris, 23rd] The French Foreign Ministry announced that the four allied nations have concluded a three-nation coal agreement, which will increase the amount of Ruhr coal France receives in 1948. The agreement was reached by Britain, the United States, and France in Berlin after the breakdown of the four foreign ministers' conference.</p>
<p>The agreement stipulates that the export of West German coal will continue to be based on the sliding scale method. According to the plan established by the Western powers at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in April of this year, the amount of coal Germany delivers to France and other European industries is directly linked to the daily output of the Ruhr. The French Foreign Ministry's communiqué stated that the sliding scale for German coal exports will continue to be implemented until the end of 1948, but will be modified to increase the proportion of coking coal in the export quota. Official French figures show that France's quota in 1947 was slightly more than 3 million tons, in other words, about half of the amount that French experts say is needed to fully operate the French steel industry. The communiqué also stated that the representatives of the three countries plan to jointly participate in the investigation of the critical situation of Ruhr coal production in the future, so that coal can be exported at 30% of production, instead of the current sliding scale, which at its maximum is only 35%.</p>

<h3>Panama Refuses to Lease Military Bases. US Troops Withdraw from Panamanian Territory. US and Nicaragua Plan to Dig New Canal.</h3>
<p>[News from this Newspaper] Broadcast from New York, 24th: Washington News, the US Caribbean Commission announced that the US military has begun withdrawing from its military bases in Panama this morning. The garrison on Saint Choros Island, which was previously used as a chemical warfare test base, was the first to withdraw. According to an army spokesperson, this withdrawal plan was drafted long ago, because the United States has no right to station troops there.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The State Department announced that the United States will withdraw as quickly as possible from the 14 bases in the Republic of Panama that refused to lease to the United States. Earlier, the Panamanian Parliament had unanimously rejected an agreement that would have allowed the United States to lease these areas for five to ten years. In the future, the United States can only deploy defenses for the Panama Canal within the Panama Canal Zone.</p>
<p>The State Department's statement said: "Based on the verbal statement made during negotiations with the Panamanian government, the US military will immediately take the necessary steps to withdraw from the cities of the Republic of Panama outside the Canal Zone. This withdrawal will be completed as quickly as possible depending on the number of people stationed and the amount of equipment. The State Department also said that the United States believes that these bases are necessary for the canal's defenses, but the United States also does not want to have an agreement that cannot be accepted by the Panamanian people." It is reported that there are about 2,000 US troops stationed at the 14 bases in Panama, among which the B-29 bomber base in Rio Hato is the most important. The Canal Zone is ten miles wide and is leased indefinitely to the United States by Panama for an annual rent of 400,000 yuan, which is not within the scope of the dispute.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 23rd] After the Panamanian Congress refused to ratify the agreement to lease bases to the United States, Angel, chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Committee, said that his committee would immediately begin investigating the possibility of building a new canal connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The US government recently recommended to Congress to allocate 2 billion yuan to make the existing Panama Canal a canal that is level with the sea surface and does not require locks, in order to reduce the effectiveness of atomic bombs on the canal. As for the war to open a canal in Central America, it has often become a topic of discussion here. Nicaragua north of Panama is considered the most likely location.</p>
<p>[Dispatch from United Press, Panama City, 24th] Panamanian Foreign Minister Ford told United Press that he believes that although Panama has rejected the US base agreement, Panama and the United States can still cooperate on defending the Panama Canal.</p>

Furthermore, in compliance with the Executive Yuan's order, it was decided to establish the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies, effective immediately. Mayor Wu will serve concurrently as the chairman. According to regulations, the chairman will appoint one member each from the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Food, the Municipal Council, and the Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies, as well as two members from local voluntary organizations. Until all members are appointed, the operations will be temporarily entrusted to the Civil Food Allocation Committee.</p>
<p>Principles of Handling</p>
<p>The following are excerpts from the Executive Yuan's principles for handling American relief supplies and the measures for distributing American relief supplies in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou for reference. Excerpts from the Principles for Handling American Relief Supplies: Both China and the United States will regularly send personnel to various regions to supervise the progress of the distribution. The first batch of American relief supplies, including approximately 20,000 tons of grain, will arrive soon. The distribution committees in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will, based on the measures passed by the Executive Yuan's executive meeting, expand the scope of distribution, determine the target recipients and prices, and conduct detailed research on how to continue the distribution work in the future, submitting proposals for a decision. After the American relief supplies arrive in China, the overall receiving, storage, and transportation will be the responsibility of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies. Local receiving, storage, and transportation will be the responsibility of the local committees.</p>
<p>Distribution Measures</p>
<p>The measures for distributing American relief supplies in the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou are as follows: The distribution of American relief supplies in each city shall be handled in accordance with the Sino-American Relief Agreement signed by the Chinese and American governments on February 27, 1947, and the handling measures for relief supplies in the third item of the working guidelines of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies (hereinafter referred to as the Yuan Committee). The materials referred to in these measures for distribution are limited to grain supplied by the American government, specifically rice and flour. To implement the distribution plan and supervise existing local organizations in distributing American relief supplies, the Executive Yuan, through the Yuan Committee, will entrust each municipal government to organize a Municipal Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies (hereinafter referred to as the Municipal Committee) to handle the matter. The members of each Municipal Committee shall be appointed by the mayor of each city, including one representative from the Yuan Committee, one representative from the Ministry of Food, one representative from the Ministry of Social Affairs, one representative from the Municipal Council, and one to two members from local voluntary organizations. The chairman of each Municipal Committee shall be concurrently held by the mayor of each city, appointed by the Executive Yuan. Other members shall be appointed by the chairman. The organizational structure, operational plan, and delegation to existing local organizations for handling distribution, as well as the administrative operation budget of each Municipal Committee, shall be drafted by the concurrent chairman and submitted to the Yuan Committee for submission to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Detailed Legislative Election Measures Differ Slightly, According to Chen Minshu</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to Chen Minshu, section chief of the Regional Election Section of the Election Affairs Office, the details of the legislative elections in this city differ slightly from what has been reported: Regarding the legislative elections, the Election Affairs Office's previously proposed improvement plan advocated for abolishing the voter registration certificate and replacing it with the national identification card. However, after reporting, the election headquarters instructed that the voter registration certificate is mandated by law and cannot be abolished, ordering that both be used concurrently. The Election Affairs Office has decided to comply. That is, during the legislative elections, regional voters must bring both their voter registration certificate and national identification card to vote. Failure to provide either will absolutely disqualify them from voting. The municipal government has already announced that all citizens should apply for national identification cards from their respective district heads. With the election still far off, the district heads can certainly process applications before the election, and there should be no situation where processing is delayed. If voters have not obtained their identification cards before the election, they will be considered to have voluntarily forfeited their right to vote. The intention of using national identification cards in the election is to easily verify the authenticity of voters. Therefore, it has been decided that the identification card is a necessary condition for voting. Receipts issued by district heads for national identification card applications will not be accepted as substitutes under any circumstances. The report stating that "receipts issued by district heads can be used as substitutes" is inaccurate. Voter registration certificates are, according to regulations, no longer issued during legislative elections. However, considering that many voters lost their voter registration certificates after the National Assembly elections, the Election Affairs Office has decided to reissue them to regional voters for the sake of expediency. However, the color will be slightly different from the previous ones to prevent abuse. The issuance of voter registration certificates and national identification cards is the responsibility of the election officials. If any district head withholds them during the legislative elections, strict disciplinary action will be taken. Voters must also personally collect and sign for their identification cards and voter registration certificates from the district head to show due diligence. The names of candidates will be printed on the legislative election ballots, and voters only need to circle one. Illiterate voters can still have someone mark the ballot for them, as in the National Assembly elections. The number of regional polling stations has been reduced from 200 to 126. The Election Affairs Office has decided to assign one guide to each polling station, and the personnel selection process has already begun.</p>

<h3>Constitutional Governance Begins Today, Municipal Government Information Office Launches Publicity Campaign</h3>
<p>Today marks the first anniversary of the completion of the Constitution and the day the Constitution of the Republic of China comes into effect. The central government attaches great importance to the commencement of constitutional governance. The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, in coordination with the mobilization for suppression of rebellion and the completion of the implementation of constitutional governance, drafted "Essential Guidelines for Expanding Publicity on the Implementation of Constitutional Governance," which was approved by the Executive Yuan and issued to all provinces and cities for compliance. Yesterday, the Information Office of the Municipal Government received a telegram from the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan instructing it to launch publicity and celebration activities at the appropriate time to facilitate the promotion of constitutional governance.</p>

<h3>Compensation Materials to be Loaded, Two Vessels "Ming Zheng" Bound for Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Liaison Meeting of the Committee for Supervising the Transportation of Japanese Compensation Materials was held yesterday at the China Merchants Bureau. It was decided that the Hai Kang轮 will depart on January 5th of next year, and the first batch of compensation materials is expected to be transported back around January 25th. The Hai Zhe轮 is scheduled to depart around January 15th. However, according to reporters, although the Hai Zhe轮 was repaired at the Keelung Shipyard and completed earlier, it has been grounded at the entrance of the shipyard by the Dingzhou轮 of the Zhoushan Company. Therefore, it must wait for the Dingzhou to be towed away before it can leave the dock. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the Hai Zhe can sail to Japan as scheduled. In addition, the committee recently received a letter from the Tokyo Liaison Committee personnel, stating that due to various restrictions by the Allied Headquarters, the labels for the first batch of materials could not be properly affixed, and the material reception between departments will be chaotic. After receiving the letter, the relevant Chinese authorities have sent a telegram to negotiate. At yesterday's meeting, it was also agreed that at the next meeting, each unit should submit a report on the preparation for the receiving work. The Supervision Committee will also issue a weekly newsletter to inform the work situation. In addition, the receiving warehouse of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has been found to be the seventh terminal of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong, and the warehouse has a large capacity to meet the needs.</p>
<p>[Also reported] More than 100 Japanese residents in the city will return to their country on the Hai Chen or Hai Zhe vessels.</p>
<h3>A Terrifying Memory: Yesterday Last Year, Wang Xiaodidi, Who Survived a Great Disaster, Celebrates a Memorable Christmas</h3>
<p>[Our Report] On Christmas Eve last year, three passenger planes of China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation crashed in the sky above the city. Among the more than 80 passengers who were almost all killed or injured, three-year-old Wang Xiaodidi miraculously survived without any injuries, which was widely regarded as a miracle. This lucky child who was rescued from the disaster on Christmas Day has been healthy and active, and extraordinarily intelligent in the past year, and can already recognize more than 300 characters. He says he never wants to fly again, and often describes to people the tragic scene of the plane crashing to the ground with a loud noise. In his innocent mind, it seems that many terrifying memories still remain. He is quite averse to seeing doctors. Whenever a doctor carrying a medical kit appears, he bows repeatedly and avoids him in every way, fearing that he will be subjected to the painful injections and treatments he received during the emergency rescue after the plane crash last year. His only protector in Shanghai is Ms. Tang Yijun, the sister of his deceased mother. Tang loves him more than anything else. To reduce his terrifying associations with the past, she has specially made several sets of large-scale airplane toys, which are beautiful and clean, for him to ponder and think about, hoping to gradually親 near them and restore his normal psychology. His parents and younger sister, who have said goodbye to him forever, are no longer clearly remembered in his impression. Today, he is getting ready in new clothes, preparing to celebrate the fourth Christmas in his life, which is worthy of memorial. (The attached photo shows Wang Xiaodidi, playing with a model airplane on Christmas Day, taken by our newspaper)</p>

<h3>Posing as a Judge, Lawyer Extorted Money, Court Investigates Thoroughly</h3>
<p>A lawyer named Yang Bopeng was previously entrusted by his friend Mao Qi to purchase a house for his wife, Wang Caiwen. Yang filed a lawsuit against Zhang Ouguo regarding the price increase. Because Yang had a close friendship with Mao, he did not discuss legal fees and instead falsely used the name of Judge Yang Wei of the District Court to demand 10 million yuan from Mao as remuneration. Judge Yang heard about this and signed a request to the court for investigation. According to Mao, the lawyer Yang's extortion did occur. The District Court believes that this matter concerns judicial ethics and, in addition to reporting it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for the record, transferred Yang Bopeng to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.</p>

<h3>Robbery at British Consulate General: Apprehended with Stolen Goods Within 24 Hours</h3>

Given the strict security at the premises, making external entry difficult, the incident was considered suspicious. The Huangpu Branch Bureau was notified to investigate. Branch Chief Zhang ordered section chief Li Yinmin to dispatch Section Members Sergeant George and Shi Xueshan to the scene. They learned that Li Yansheng, a close friend of old steward Xu Jiufeng, had been seen loitering inside and spent a long time in the lavatory before leaving. The police officers inspected the lavatory and discovered a note left behind by Li, which read: "Second Brother Gengsheng, it's been a long time since we communicated." Based on this lead, they apprehended the suspect and recovered the stolen goods within 24 hours.

<h3>Merry Christmas Celebrations: Some Rejoice, Some Grieve; The Wealthy Indulge, the Poor Can Barely Breathe</h3>
<p>[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Christmas, a day of dancing and celebration for many! The cold wave has temporarily left the earth, but soaring rice prices have created a divide in this city. The wealthy revel in joy, while the poor struggle to breathe under the weight of rice prices. In the large display window of the Ford Motor Company on Zhongzheng West Road, two deer pull a new model "Ford," and Santa Claus in the car carries a sack full of banknotes. Passersby are drawn to this beautiful scene, gathering in groups, but to what end? It's just an advertisement!</p>
<p>What will Santa Claus bring us this year? Tens of thousands of refugees inside and outside the shelter dream distant dreams every night. From street corners to bridge piers, from the ends of alleys, they hope that a collection vehicle will take them to the shelter. On the eve of Christmas, the shelter found that one of the newly admitted refugees was carrying nine pawn tickets; another, unable to bear the hunger, ate sixteen pieces of dried tofu from a street vendor without money to pay, and was grabbed by the vendor; and another, named Zhang Yushu, claimed to have been a reporter for the Nanjing Dazhong Daily, who, after being unemployed for a long time, came to Shanghai to visit friends but failed to find them. He was mistakenly identified as a refugee by the police and forcibly admitted. With tears in his eyes, he said to others, "The outside world must be celebrating wildly, right?"</p>
<p>Precious Warmth, a Huddled Group</p>
<p>Isn't wild celebration a fact? The dance hall orchestra plays the most stimulating melodies, tea costs 200,000 yuan a cup, and a Christmas dinner costs 500,000 yuan per person. In every dance floor, you only see paper hats turning excitedly, high and low. At eleven o'clock, how can the dance floor's business hours limit the desire to seek pleasure, find bars, find friends, change places to dance. Where there are Christmas trees, turkeys, silver bells, and balloons, there is warmth, this precious warmth! A waning crescent moon in the sky shines coldly all night on a group huddled by the roadside!</p>
<p>The Aftermath of the Accident Guarantees Safety</p>
<p>With bright stars and a clear moon in the vast sky, Christmas night travelers should be the luckiest. The lingering fear of the simultaneous crash of three passenger planes on this day last year still remains, but this year, the large runway and runway lights at the Sanhua Airport have ensured that this misfortune will not happen again. May God bless these poor people who are busy traveling thousands of miles? No fog, no wind, what a bright Christmas Eve! Wang Xiaodi, a young boy who survived last year's plane crash, has happily passed the anniversary of his ordeal.</p>
<p>Listening to the Blessing Bells Celebrate National Revival</p>
<p>The Xinjiang song and dance troupe, who have been guests in this foreign land for nearly a month, are also welcoming this holiday, which does not belong to their religion, with joy. On October 23, they had already celebrated the "Sacrifice Festival" in Nanjing, which is also the Islamic New Year. When they first arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing, the first thing that surprised them was the "density of people." They wondered, if it was a grand festival, to what extent would this density of people develop? Christmas has finally arrived, and they have decided to take this opportunity to visit various places carefully. This passionate day will be even more astonishing in the eyes of the compatriots in the border area, right?</p>
<p>When the blessing bells ring in the church, will you know that today, besides Christmas, is also our own National Revival Day, the day the Constitution goes into effect!</p>
<h3>"White Tiger Reigns, Disaster is Certain": A Marvelous Confession in a Kidnapping Case; A Diviner Knowingly Committed a Crime</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Tailor Jin Wenbin, Cao Rendang, and Tian Shengde conspired on October 15 to kidnap Tang Xiaoming, the young child of Tang Guyun. However, Jin and the other two were illiterate, so they asked fortune teller Jiang Zhigao to write a threatening letter demanding 50 million yuan, promising to give Jiang 2 million yuan as a reward after the matter was completed. Before writing the letter, they also had a character analyzed and obtained the character "慮" (worry). After the case was discovered, the police arrested Jin and others and transferred them to the District Court for handling. According to Jiang's confession: when analyzing the character "慮", he knew that this matter was ominous, because the character "慮" has a "white tiger" on top, and disaster is certain, but because the income from fortune telling and character analysis was meager, he coveted the 3 million yuan reward and unknowingly fell into the net of the law, requesting the court to be lenient in sentencing. After the trial, the court decided to hold the trial on the 31st of this month.</p>

<h3>Adjusting County Education Funding to Align with Constitutional Implementation: The Ministry of Education is Drafting a Plan and Consulting with the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Education, due to the fact that the education funding in various provinces and counties after the restoration is far from the standard stipulated in the Constitution for the constitutional period (the Constitution stipulates that education and cultural funding in counties should account for 35% of the total county funding, while the education funding in a very small number of provinces is only about 10%, and the rest are even lower), in order to remedy this situation and align local education in various provinces with the Constitution, the relevant departments and personnel have held repeated meetings to discuss and draft a plan, which is currently being consulted with the Ministry of Finance.

<h3>University Entrance Qualifications: Including Equivalent Academic Ability; Liu Yingshi Expresses His Opinion</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] On the 22nd of this month, the Legislative Yuan passed the University Law. Regarding the clause on entrance qualifications, the original draft of the Ministry of Education was limited to graduates of secondary schools and equivalent schools.

<h3>Peking University and Tsinghua University Graduate Students Request Improved Treatment; Entrusting Central University Students to Petition the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping Airmail] Graduate students from Peking University and Tsinghua University recently sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting improved treatment. The original telegram is as follows: "To Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education in Nanjing: The treatment of graduate students in various universities is meager and has long been difficult to maintain. Recently, prices have skyrocketed everywhere, especially in North China. The monthly income of students is not enough to maintain three meals a day. Reading with an empty stomach is beyond our ability, and our work has stagnated, which is contrary to our wishes. Moreover, most of the graduate students currently in school completed their middle school and university studies in the midst of war. After ten years of displacement, their studies have been greatly damaged. If they cannot even get enough to eat or buy a book while they are engaged in research today, what will be the consequences? Your Excellency must be able to see clearly. I believe that the way to build a nation is to first emphasize academic independence. The nature and importance of the work of students engaged in research in domestic universities is no different from that of students studying abroad or teaching assistants in various schools. The government can provide the former with sufficient foreign exchange and the latter with appropriate new salaries, but the treatment of the latter is particularly meager, which seems inappropriate in terms of both reason and emotion. After checking, the number of graduate students in each school is not too large. Even if the treatment is improved, the increase in the burden on the national treasury will be very limited. Central University and other schools previously requested an increase in graduate student stipends to three-quarters of the total income of teaching assistants, which is the minimum standard. Your Excellency is wise and will surely grant our request so that we can concentrate on our work. We are located in North China, and the situation is special, and we are particularly eager. In addition to entrusting Central University students to petition in person, we hereby submit this telegram and respectfully request that you grant it as soon as possible to comfort our hopes and avoid dropping out of school. We await your orders with utmost anticipation! Graduate Student Association of National Tsinghua University, Graduate Student Association of National Peking University."</p>

<h3>After the Passage of the Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Regulations, Chairman Yuan Returns to Shanghai to Prepare; Management Committee Decides to Be Established Next Year</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The National Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Regulations have been passed by the Executive Yuan's 35th regular meeting on the 23rd, the full text of which appeared in yesterday's newspaper. Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Committee, took the passed management regulations back to Shanghai at 2:45 pm yesterday. He immediately drove to the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee and summoned the heads of the various departments of the Cotton Yarn Management Committee (including the six departments of Secretariat, Procurement and Transportation, Manufacturing, Distribution, Finance, and Accounting, and the three offices of Personnel, Supervision, and Auditing). They discussed various detailed rules for handling affairs and the printing of all kinds of documents. He also conducted a final review of all personnel of the original Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee to determine who would stay and who would leave, in order to facilitate the transition.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan met with reporters at the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee at 5:00 pm yesterday. He stated that the implementation of the comprehensive control policy for flower and cotton yarn was based on a handwritten instruction from the highest central authority. The central authorities, in view of the recent price fluctuations in various regions, believed that the primary task to stabilize people's livelihoods was to control materials and manage floating capital. Therefore, the comprehensive control of flower and cotton yarn was the first step, with the overall goal of managing national finance.</p>
<p>After the new management regulations are passed, the original Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee will be closed down before the end of this year. The Cotton Yarn Management Committee will be formally established on January 2nd next year.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Cotton Yarn Management Committee, the first step will be to carry out a general registration. This includes: registering the amount of cotton in stock at yarn factories, the daily output of yarn, the current amount of yarn in stock, and the amount of cotton to be consumed in the future; registering the amount of yarn in stock at weaving factories to facilitate yarn-for-cloth transactions; and registering the amount of cotton in stock at cotton merchants, which will be purchased at a fixed price. The registration period will be from January 2nd next year to January 10th for this city, and to January 15th for other cities. Orders will be issued and announcements will be made simultaneously. Those who fail to register within the deadline will be subject to appropriate penalties.</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase of domestic cotton, Mr. Yuan stated that in this time of war and chaos, military transportation is heavy and traffic conditions are often unpredictable, so it is impossible to guarantee certainty. However, an appropriate amount of foreign cotton will be imported to facilitate allocation, depending on the actual supply and demand of raw cotton.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan then showed a table compiled by the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee comparing the price increases of 25 major commodities in the city, comparing the market prices on January 5th of this year with those on December 11th of this year. American cotton rose by 2030%, ranking 11th; Shashi cotton rose by 1998%, ranking 12th; 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 1210%, ranking 19th; Longtou fine cloth rose by 1129%, ranking 21st; and 42-count double-strand Lanfeng yarn rose by 837%, ranking 25th. This shows that the price increase of flower and cotton yarn is still relatively stable. The fact that raw materials have risen more than finished products also indicates a decrease in general purchasing power.</p>
<p>Currently, the national cotton spinning industry has a total of 4.5 million spindles, but only over 3.6 million spindles are actually in operation. He hopes that all spindles can be fully operational within one and a half years to increase cotton yarn production and promote export sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan concluded by saying that he deeply hopes that the people and the government will achieve thorough cooperation in the implementation of this flower and cotton yarn management policy, and sweep away the previous wait-and-see attitude. He cited registration as an example, saying that those who truthfully declare their registration figures will definitely benefit in the future. Therefore, he earnestly hopes that officials and the people can cooperate sincerely so that the flower and cotton yarn management policy can发挥最大功能.</p>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] After the National Flower and Cotton Yarn Management Regulations were passed by the Executive Yuan, reporters specifically sought the opinion of Mr. Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District. Mr. Wang stated that he was unwilling to express any opinion and would only wait for the implementation of the regulations. However, he personally had one suggestion, namely that the personnel implementing the regulations, from the heads of the various departments to the personnel actually carrying out the work in various regions, must have complete and skilled experience in all relevant departments of flower and cotton yarn. In other words, they must be experts in all departments of flower and cotton yarn so that many unnecessary losses and delays can be avoided when implementing the regulations.</p>

The Hai Xuan vessel left for Bangkok on the 20th of this month to transport rice and has already arrived in Hong Kong. It will soon sail south and is scheduled to transport rice back to Shanghai in mid-January. In addition, the Hai Su vessel is scheduled to sail to Karachi next Tuesday, also calling at Hong Kong, Singapore, and Rangoon, and will transport a large quantity of materials back.</p>
<h3>No Special Restrictions on Industrial and Commercial Remittances</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] As the end of the year approaches, industrial and commercial remittances to Shanghai from various regions will inevitably be higher than usual. Regarding whether such remittances will be relaxed, reporters specifically visited a responsible person from the National Bank to inquire for their opinion. They stated that the National Bank is only restricting domestic remittances and has not stopped them. All industrial and commercial remittances that are genuinely needed and whose account name and source are verified will still be allowed, and there are no other restrictions. When asked about the review process for general industrial and commercial remittances, they stated that the Ministry of Finance is currently drafting regulations, which will be announced soon. They also revealed that the regulations on stopping general loans will not be changed in the short term.</p>
<h3>Term Deposits From Other Banks; National Bank Absorbs Over 100 Billion</h3>
<p>It is reported that the National Bank's term deposits from other banks have absorbed over 100 billion yuan as of recently. National Bank savings departments and commercial banks and firms each account for half of this amount. The interest rate on these deposits remains at 8%, with a term of 10 days, and the fixed amount per unit remains at 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>Spinning Mill Building Allocates Yarn</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company opened sales of jointly allocated cotton yarn yesterday, selling a total of 2,043 pieces of various counts of yarn. There were a total of 144 purchase orders, with six weaving factories from in and out of town, accounting for 315 pieces of yarn. The total yarn sold yesterday was 2,287 pieces of 20-count yarn.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>The rayon market saw a slight recovery yesterday. No. 120 Xu character glossy rayon opened at 76 million yuan in the morning, then rose to 77 million yuan with some transactions. The noon close was 77.5 million yuan, and the final price in the afternoon was 77 million yuan. Futures were around 5 million yuan. As a result, the price rose by 2 million yuan compared to the previous day, and Tianqiao, Dongyang, etc. also rose accordingly.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Recover After Weakness</h3>
<p>The cigarette market saw a steady stream of deliveries, with stores eagerly restocking. New buyers were active in the market, and prices turned from weak to firm. As a result, 10-piece Great Britain and Lao Dao cigarettes each rose sharply by 2.4 million yuan per case compared to the previous day. In addition, Meili brand cigarettes from Chinese manufacturers rose the most, by 12,000 yuan, while other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose by 1,000 to 10,000 yuan. 50-piece tins of cigarettes were in short supply and rose by 12,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>"Historian and Science"</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>(Original by Gaetano Salvemini, translated by Professor Zhou Qianchong, published by Commercial Press.)</p>
<p>Before introducing this book, let us first introduce the original author, Professor Gaetano Salvemini, to the readers. He is the greatest contemporary Italian historian, with a unique understanding of the history of Italian civilization. In 1925, when the demon Mussolini and his Fascist henchmen began their cries, this great master of history did not sit idly by and watch these villains who demeaned the people run rampant. He first exposed the dictatorship and danger of this group to the people of Italy and the world in his lectures at the University of Florence, and was arrested as a result. After being released from prison, he fled to England, and then to the United States. On this new continent, he lectured at Yale University and Harvard University, and tried his best to expose the dictatorial crimes of the demon, echoing the great composer Toscanini (also an Italian) in the United States at the same time, encouraging the Italian people to rise up against Fascism.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of lectures by Mr. Salvemini at the University of Chicago, so the language is light and maintains the style of conversation, making it more intimate to read. Moreover, there are very few technical terms, and it goes from the shallow to the deep. In addition, the translator, Professor Zhou Qianchong's, pleasant writing style ensures that this masterpiece does not have the bitter taste of a moralist preaching and reciting scriptures with a solemn face. Therefore, we especially recommend it to readers: This is a very rare book that has been published recently.</p>
<p>In the past one or two decades, people in any country have blindly believed in the political, economic, and cultural opinions of some natural scientists, which has made Professor Salvemini very angry. He used his extensive knowledge to refute the arguments that "history is common sense" or "history is art." History itself is a science, and historians are also scientists, but not natural scientists (Mr. Salvemini calls natural science "the science of the physical world" and human science "the science of the human world"). For history and physics, science is not a difference between "yes" and "no," but a difference between "more" and "less," because all conclusions and arguments in history cannot have 100% authenticity like physics. Therefore, historians "lose many believers." The facts studied by historians must be unique and complex. He cannot use objective standards to measure the objects he studies. He cannot repeat history that has passed for two or three hundred years to seek causality like physicists after countless experiments. Therefore, historians' conclusions are allowed to have biases and errors, and they need to be revised from time to time. But this does not mean that historians are not scientists; if so, we can declare that Pasteur is not a scientist because he believes that all diseases are caused by germs, but today the medical community has proven that diseases are caused by a lack of certain vitamins or organ dysfunction. Can it be justified to say that Pasteur is not a scientist because he made mistakes? The same can be applied to human science. There are also many relatively simple departments in the history field, such as paleography and numismatics, whose authenticity and systematicness are no less than any natural science. This means that the simpler the phenomenon, the closer it is to the category of science. Conversely, in chemistry, the more complex the changes, the less close they are to authenticity, and there are still many hypotheses that cannot be proven true or false.</p>
<p>After many discussions, the original author believes that historians and even social scientists are not completely error-free and are allowed to have biases. His use of biases to seek the cause and effect of a historical phenomenon is like a natural scientist using hypotheses to try to explain a physical phenomenon. "In solving social problems, since no one is error-free, then the only way to solve social problems is to try various solutions... We are not sure that we possess absolute truth in social problems. Therefore, we must not despise the various viewpoints that stand in opposition to us; we have no right to use violent means to eliminate the opinions of others." This is the essence of Mr. Salvemini's book, which is also the theoretical basis of his free and democratic thought. As he said, "Only fascists say 'Mussolini is always right,' Catholics obey 'one God, one truth, one Church of Jesus,' and those stubborn communists believe that 'Marx's Capital is always error-free.'" Liberals should have "humility and forgiveness" and have an attitude of trying and possibly making mistakes in solving social problems—just like the British say "Muddling the rough"; not respecting the opinions and speaking rights of the enemy is an unscientific spirit, and we do not recognize that kind of historian as a true historian, let alone a scientist.</p>
<p>When discussing the relationship between philosophy and history, we dare not completely agree with Mr. Salvemini's opinion. He said, "The writings of philosophers seem to be factories for manufacturing clouds, which will confuse my ideas... I have no philosophy of history." But the author forgot why he praised democracy and freedom and opposed fascist dictatorship. Isn't that his philosophy of history? Maybe he is being too humble.</p>
<p>At the end of this book, there is an extremely valuable essay "What is Culture?" It generally says that it is not very coherent with the previous content. In the article, Professor Salvemini has a pertinent criticism of the modern education system. "Many teachers believe that reading and studying must be about broad knowledge and strong memory, and having the knowledge of an encyclopedia; this disease is 'stuck in the past.' It damages the mental health of both teachers and students." "Schools cannot impart knowledge that is necessary for life, useful, or enjoyable. What schools can provide are a few clear, well-organized facts and concepts that can serve as a structure to place more life experiences in the future." The author's argument has many similarities with Shaw's argument, so this last essay may be even more valuable for teachers and students in schools.</p>
<p>After reading the whole book, I also believe that a sound historian should also have a good foundation in natural science. Looking at Mr. Salvemini's many citations to physics, astronomy, and medicine, we know that he has not relaxed his knowledge of "the science of the material world," and has a very deep understanding, which is very different from those historians who only look at old paper scraps.</p>
<h3>Lecture Notes on New Trigonometry</h3>
<p>— Suo Yi</p>
<p>(Edited by Zhu Fenghao, published by Nengmen United Bookstore.)</p>
<p>The adoption of secondary school textbooks is most troublesome for science textbooks. Those compiled by Chinese people are often considered crude and simple, while completely adopting original books is impractical. Therefore, most students feel inconvenienced. As far as I know, Mr. Zhu's Lecture Notes on New Trigonometry is actually the most complete and practical mathematics textbook currently available.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu relied on decades of teaching experience, combined the essence of European and American mathematicians, and completed this book after dozens of on-site teaching sessions. Although the author modestly claims that "there are still many omissions and errors," as far as I know, except for the omission of "known X is an acute angle" in Question 2 of Exercise 4 on page 22 and the correction of "one" to "ten" in Item 2 of Question 1 of Exercise 13 on page 127, it is simply impossible to find errors. It can be said that it is one of the textbooks with the fewest errors.</p>
<p>What I want to praise most is that this book has several characteristics: First, identities (Chapters 3 and 7), equations, measurement problems (Chapters 4 and 11), inverse trigonometric functions (Chapter 8), and elimination methods (Chapter 12) are listed as special chapters, and each chapter is classified and fully discussed. Detailed explanations are given for various methods of solving problems, especially "the substitution method of one." Second, all the important example problems in the book are listed with multiple different solutions, which can improve readers' interest in research. Third, a square frame is drawn next to the example problems in this book, indicating the characteristics of the solution to the problem, in order to wake up the eyebrows and deepen the impression of learners. Fourth, there are also many examples selected for the application of trigonometry in analytic geometry, which can enable readers to integrate trigonometric solutions into geometry and benefit from analogies.</p>
<p>In particular, the miscellaneous examples of proof problems in Chapter 7 are most welcomed by readers. It lists various proof methods, such as the application of Demcivre, the transformation method of special angle functions, the solution of finite product and finite series problems, and the problems of arithmetic series, geometric series, etc. It also lists one hundred exercises with various solution methods. Readers chew on them as if chewing olives, and the more they do, the more interested they become. Regarding the elimination method (Eliminaion), the author himself believes that it is not complete enough and plans to add more. Then, this book can be said to be perfect.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to quote the author's motto as the conclusion: "One more proofreading, less misleading readers." I hope that writers across the country will work hard to proofread their works, which is the most sacred work!</p>
<h3>A Reference Book for Studying Japan</h3>
<p>— Bin Zhi</p>
<p>"Research Materials on Japan," edited by the China Academic Society, Dacheng Edition</p>
<p>The war has ended for two years, and the peace treaty with Germany is still under negotiation. The peace conference with Japan is yet to be resolved. Japan can be considered the main culprit of World War II, but due to international conflicts, defeated Japan has been able to calmly engage in post-war reconstruction. Although under Allied control, its spirit of perseverance and hard work reveals its vigorous ambition, showing a strong tendency to rise again. On the other hand, our victorious country is still plagued by war, and the people cannot yet enjoy peace.</p>
<p>We have suffered enough from Japan in the past, and seeing the current situation in Japan, we cannot help but feel deep concern. Before the peace treaty with Japan is resolved, we must eliminate the elements of war in Japan. This is not only for China's sake but also related to peace in the Far East and security in the world. To eliminate Japan's war-making elements, we must first understand the situation in Japan.</p>
<p>The China Academic Society has compiled a "Research Materials on Japan," which is the latest systematic research book on Japanese issues after the war. It describes Japan's post-war situation and current issues separately. The entire book consists of ten volumes, each volume discussing a single issue. "Post-War Japan and the Allied Powers," "An Overview of the Control of Japan," "Post-War Japan's Finance and Economy," "The State of Japanese Industry After the War," and "Post-War Japan's Culture and Education" have already been published. "Japan's Political Situation Before and After Surrender," "Post-War Japan's Political Parties and Parliament," "Post-War Japan's Constitution and the Imperial Family," "Post-War Japanese Society," and "Post-War Japanese Literature and Art" are currently being printed. Judging from its topics, it already includes the Japanese situation that we need to know.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the content of the five published volumes: "Post-War Japan and the Allied Powers" and "An Overview of the Control of Japan" report on how the United States has been condoning Japan for the past two years. To what extent has it been condoning Japan? An answer can be found here. It can also serve as a reference for how Japan should be handled in the peace treaty in the future.</p>
<p>In the peace treaty, one important issue is how to stipulate the future industrial level of Japan. Due to the different circumstances of each country and different views, there are different opinions. The two books, "Post-War Japan's Finance and Economy" and "The State of Japanese Industry After the War," describe in detail the current economic situation in Japan. From here, we can know which factories should be dismantled and which production should be restricted. How to determine reparations, to what extent the dissolution of financial cliques is implemented, and what kind of policy should be adopted for foreign trade can all be answered.</p>
<p>To eliminate the elements of war in Japan, the most important thing is to transform the thinking of the Japanese people. The militaristic democracy that Japan promoted in the past and the Bushido education that was implemented are the biggest obstacles to Japan moving towards democracy in the future. Therefore, to eliminate the threat of war from Japan and to ensure lasting peace in the Far East and the world, Japan's education must be transformed. "Post-War Japan's Culture and Education" describes the current state of Japanese education, as well as religion, thought, science, and so on. We can find out what the consequences of Japan's re-education have been in the past two years.</p>
<h3>Words on the Psychology of Learning</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Written by Fu Binran, published by Kaiming Bookstore, priced at one yuan and ninety cents.</p>
<p>This book does not talk about learning methods but only about the direction of learning. If we use a ship as an analogy, this is not the paddle that propels the ship forward but the rudder that determines the direction of the ship.</p>
<p>The entire book consists of twelve chapters, which are not continuous or connected. Each chapter has its own independence, but generally, there is still a system to be found. There are many new insights on mental hygiene. The author uses simple and common examples to introduce them, and then refers to reliable experiments, drawing on various sources to clearly outline a distinct contour, so that readers can deeply remember it.</p>
<p>"Learning is an activity in which an individual makes appropriate responses to stimuli from the environment," the author explains this most popular explanation of learning twice in the first chapter. Therefore, in the following chapters, he repeatedly emphasizes the impact of the environment on learning. Based on the conclusions drawn from the theory of heredity and the theory of environment, the author believes that "what heredity gives us is only various specific abilities, not content; and ability is only a possible tendency, a starting point of plasticity." Therefore, from the perspective of education, since whether the hereditary ability can be fully developed depends on the quality of the environment, the impact of the environment on individual development is much more important than heredity. Because of this, except for the 2% of geniuses and idiots, the fate of ordinary people depends on the degree of personal effort. The so-called genius can only be developed through society and the masses. Otherwise, "cleverness is often ruined by cleverness." How many geniuses who were brilliant in their lives ended up in a tragic situation, becoming a laughing stock for the world? This is the best lesson.</p>
<p>However, an individual's success or failure depends on the degree of their own efforts, but effort must also have the direction and method of effort. The learning of skills and knowledge focuses on application and understanding. We should seek genuine knowledge and living knowledge that are realistic, scientific, and democratic; not empty, metaphysical, and monopolized by a few. We should eliminate dead things that are indigestible and useless. This is the reason why we want to overthrow the former imperial examination system and improve the current education system. Once the direction of learning is determined, the method must also be accurate. "As long as you put in enough effort, you can grind an iron pestle into a needle. However, if you can think of a way to divide the iron pestle into many iron coins first, and then grind the needle, wouldn't it be more efficient?" (Page 23) From this, we can see that learning requires hard work, but also requires the use of skills. In the last paragraph of the last chapter of the book, the author synthesizes the essence of "learning methodology" and "learning theory," which is quite thought-provoking:</p>
<p>"...Learning methods are originally experiences gained by predecessors through hard work. This kind of experience... can increase our learning efficiency... Learning is "practice," and learning methods are "theory." Theory is produced through practice, and then it turns around to guide practice... Learning is the main thing, and learning methods are secondary; learning comes first, and learning methods come later. Therefore... everyone must use the best methods to make the best efforts. But "it is better to retreat and weave a net than to envy the fish in the abyss." If you only talk about methods and are unwilling to put in the effort to learn, it is better to learn first and put the methods aside!"</p>
<p>These are really a few excellent proverbs for friends who are walking on the road of learning.</p>
<p>Driven by human selfishness, many bad psychologies are produced. These bad psychologies are often moths that eat away at learning. In the sixth chapter, "Sour Grapes and Sweet Lemons," the author lists several of the most common ones: In addition to the strong arguments or excuses of shirking responsibility and deceiving oneself, there are also the "substitution" of Ah Q being beaten by Zhao Gongzi and seeking out Wang Hu, beating Wang You being nothing more than joking with a nun; the "compensation" of a dwarf walking with his chest out and a protruding belly, and an ugly woman applying makeup; the "regression" of clearly being behind in material civilization but boasting about the spiritual civilization of ancestors, etc., which are all very common and extremely undesirable psychologies. To avoid these bad psychologies, we need to maintain an optimistic mood, an objective attitude, and a good environment, which are the three elements of mental hygiene.</p>
<p>The book fully elaborates on the fallacies of learning curves, the saying that understanding one thing leads to understanding everything, and the harmful effects of rote learning. It also corrects the common misconception of despising the learning ability of adults - believing that once people pass childhood and adolescence, they lose their curiosity, brainpower, assimilation ability, and no longer have the ability to learn. Of course, from the sighs of "the world is deteriorating" and "people's hearts are not as good as they used to be" from the mouths of elderly people in the upper class, it can be seen that this group of old gentlemen no longer continue to learn new things and are obsessed with the bones of the past. However, this view is only an accumulation of mistakes, a view that is habitually overlooked. According to modern psychological experiments, people's learning interest does not decrease between the ages of twenty and fifty. The saying "you can never stop learning," Lenin's "learn, learn, and learn again," and the many great men who "bloom late" further demonstrate that the ability of adults to learn does not decline. In society, we often hear people who are not yet forty years old saying that they are old and useless. This bad phenomenon must be eliminated. In this book, the author tells us that this bad phenomenon is unreliable and has found a scientific basis.</p>
<p>In short, this book is indeed a good book that is beneficial to the mind. However, although the book cites many simple examples, there are still too many specialized terms in education and psychology. Since Kaiming Bookstore has compiled it as a type of youth series, ordinary middle school students will feel a slight headache for these and thus reduce their interest in reading the book. I hope the author can improve it in the fifth edition.</p>
<h3>Talking about the General in "The Front Line"</h3>
<p>— Ruo Fei</p>
<p>"The Front Line" is a script that I have heard of for a long time. I remember it was two years ago when Mr. Shao Lizi was sent back to China from the Soviet Union and brought this book to General He Yingqin. The former was entrusted by the latter. At that time, the war was still spreading across the country, and the enemy was gathering heavy troops in various places, attempting to open up the Asian continent. "The Front Line" should have had some educational effect in China at that time, right? Unfortunately, we could not see the translated version at that time.</p>
<p>Korneichuk is a famous Soviet playwright. His debut play was "Ukrainian Steppe," a comedy depicting the pastoral love of young men and women in the Ukrainian countryside. "The Front Line" is his fourth play. The theme is to expose the self-willedness of the old-fashioned warlords in the Soviet Union and the bravery of some low-level combatants and commanders.</p>
<p>This is a contrast; on the one hand, the fighters bravely overcome the fear of death, the spirit of comradeship and harmony shrouded in a strong group, and how the new general Ognev fought his way up, finally replacing the fallen one; on the other hand, the commander of the front line who does not know how to grasp the times, does not know how to learn, is conservative and selfish, and has a strong exaggeration habit - Ivan, Gorlov - his "talkativeness" does not help the battle, and even causes various mistakes and sacrifices. The ending is that he is ordered to be dismissed and the command seal is handed over to Ognev, whom he despises the most and who was promoted out of turn.</p>
<p>What Korneichuk wrote is a typical character. He did not take a specific person or a specific situation as the object of description. His models are numerous, but after his deletion, emphasis, and sorting, he created several typical characters: such as the fallen old-fashioned general Gorlov, such as the alert and intelligent military commissar Gaidar, such as the new generation character Ognev, such as the cowardly and negligent reconnaissance minister Wu Qivielida, such as the boastful journalist Klikun, etc.</p>
<p>The publication of "The Front Line" also caused a stir in the Soviet Union, because it greatly criticized the old-fashioned generals, who were figures who had been in battle for a long time in the past and had made great achievements. Therefore, in the Soviet Union, views on "The Front Line" were also divided into two factions. One faction agreed with the author's view, believing that reasonable criticism is better than concealment and selective silence. Lunacharsky said, "Those who can criticize themselves will never be doomed to destruction due to criticism," which is the truth they agree with; the other faction accused the author of exaggeration, as if he exaggerated the ignorance and cowardice of the negative characters too much. This situation is probably the same in all countries. The question is just one: "Should darkness be exposed?" Some people object, believing that family scandals should not be publicized, while others agree, believing that without exposure, there is no way to reform. From the perspective of literary workers, no matter what position he takes, he should agree with the latter. Lao She said, "As soon as you pick up a pen, you have to look around like a thief." Under such writing circumstances, it is simply impossible to produce works like "The Front Line."</p>
<p>The story is like this:</p>
<p>Gorlov is a hero of the old era. During the founding era of the Soviet Union, he made some great contributions. When the German-Soviet war broke out, he naturally took on the important task as before, serving as the commander of the front line. However, there is no doubt that there is something wrong with the old man's head. He likes to recall the past and often says to young people: "What do you think? You don't even know two times two in military affairs. When we were fighting all over the place, you were still sucking your mother's milk... " and so on.</p>
<p>Gorlov is an old hero, we admit. But "old" is not a weapon to repel the enemy. Only by constantly striving to improve ourselves, constantly advancing, and learning, can we repel the enemy. Gorlov's failure is that he is too self-willed. Knowing that his son was killed in battle, he did not cry, which is a manifestation of his heroic character; but when he knew that Ognev had won because he did not invite him to keep his order, he flew into a rage, which is also a phenomenon that personal heroes must have.</p>
<p>When discussing strategies and tactics, Gorlov likes to make big speeches and empty talk. Whenever he is refuted by Ognev and others, his only way is to maintain the dignity of his front-line commander, regardless of everything, and resolutely issue some inexplicable orders.</p>
<p>Gorlov finally said a truthful sentence at the end of the play: "I want to correct the heads of the Ognevs." Yes, "correcting heads" is the foundation of all creation. However, what should be transformed is not Ognev, but Gorlov himself, who is conservative, selfish, and likes to talk big.</p>
<p>The whole play uses the technique of satirical comedy. The impression after the continuation is very deep. It may be even more touching to perform it.</p>

<h3>Christmas and the State of Society</h3>
<p>— Jiu Tang</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, Christmas has arrived, turkeys are on the market, gifts are in the windows, dazzling silver glitter and stars, and price tags of tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions, are enough to startle and frighten people. The joy is really overwhelmed by the sigh of hardship. The fact that the Christmas invoices of large companies cannot be sold to 1,500 sheets, and thus there is a little dissatisfaction, is still secondary.</p>
<p>Why must we celebrate Christmas? The birthday of Confucius, Qu Yuan's martyrdom, and even the birthday of Guanyin Bodhisattva do not seem to be so lively. Then, the center of the ten-mile foreign market can be said to be everywhere foreign. Even friends who burn incense and recite the Great Compassion Mantra in front of Guanyin Bodhisattva will definitely stroll around the three major companies to buy Christmas gifts for friends or superiors whom they cannot but respect, as long as they have the desire and the strength is not insufficient. The sayings of Jesus' hell and the theory that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven are probably not worth considering at all. That is to say, the meaning of Christmas in China is no different from the Mid-Autumn Festival and the New Year. Businessmen make money, and wealthy officials spend money, and there are two targets: their own stomachs and the flattery they want to pay.</p>
<p>I am not against Christmas. Those who are against it even think that Santa Claus is a snobbish villain. The result of war is bound to be economic hardship, which leads to a general decline in morality, creating a phenomenon where everything is abnormal. This is also a common occurrence in China, but using the saying from "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," "It has always been like this since ancient times, but it is even more so now." This degree is truly unprecedented. Zhang Duanyi's "Valuable Collection of Ears" says:</p>
<p>"In ancient and modern times, there are many things that rulers of the world valued. Tang and Yu valued virtue, Xia valued merit, Shang valued old age, Zhou valued kinship, Qin valued criminal law, Han valued talent and strategy, the Eastern Han valued integrity, Wei valued rhetoric, Jin valued purity and tranquility, Zhou and Sui valued clan prestige, Tang valued institutions and culture, and this dynasty valued laws and arguments."</p>
<p>Although some of what is said here is illogical, it is not bad to say that it is a characteristic of the Qin and Han dynasties. Wu Hanjun quoted this article in his essay on "Social Customs," and then said that what has been valued since the Republic of China is "reform," and in the last ten years, what has been valued is "profit." Naturally, this is very emotional, but it is also a fact. However, in my opinion, "reform" is only a matter for a few people, while profit has been a prevailing trend since the Qing Dynasty, and it is incurable. It's just that the word "profit" is not specific enough because it can also include pragmatism and altruism. China is completely selfish and self-interested. Instead of saying "profit," it is better to change it to the word "private."</p>
<p>In fairy tales, Santa Claus rewards good and punishes evil, and does not only look for those with fireplaces and warm chimneys to come down slowly. For so many evildoers in China, they should have two frogs or mice in their socks. As for the second generation of children, they are often tainted with the smell of money and power as soon as they leave their families. It is better for Santa Claus not to come. Don't let the wind and snow only hit the little girl selling matches, the young masters should also taste it.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Santa Claus</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 24, 1822, Dr. Clement Clarke Moore happily hurried home. He had left the New York Theological Seminary, where he taught, early that day because he was going to write a "Christmas Fantasy Poem" for the children. At that time, the white snow was flying.</p>
<p>He said to himself happily: "Today it really looks like a Christmas scene. I will ask Katherine and the children to let me think quietly for an hour to complete that fantasy poem."</p>
<p>So an hour later, the poem was written.</p>
<p>Everyone finished praying, followed by a sumptuous dinner. After the meal, Moore sat in a leather chair by the fireplace, and the children climbed onto his knees. His wife, Katherine, sat in a reclining chair nearby - it was a perfect Christmas Eve!</p>
<p>"I brought you a little toy - a Christmas story." Moore said to the children:</p>
<p>"It was the night before Christmas, and there was not a sound in the whole house. At that time, many stockings were hung by the chimney,</p>
<p>Waiting for the arrival of Saint Nicholas.……</p>
<p>The children held their breath and listened to their father's loud and heavy voice. He said:</p>
<p>"- This is the story told by a child who was awakened from his sleep; he jumped out of bed and stretched his eyes to look out of the window where the moon was bright and the snow was white:</p>
<p>A little old man vaguely appeared in his eyes.</p>
<p>He drove a sleigh pulled by eight little reindeer,</p>
<p>And came in quickly and lively.</p>
<p>I know, this is Saint Nicholas!</p>
<p>He is really an amazing friend! He can fly over the roof with many toys and come down from the narrow chimney.</p>
<p>"There is a round face and a bulging belly,</p>
<p>When he laughs, his belly stirs like pulp in a mortar."</p>
<p>The children asked Moore to repeat it to them again and again; they seemed to be fascinated by this "A Visit from St. Nicholas."</p>
<p>However, the next day, the respectable professor stuffed it into the drawer, mixed it with old manuscripts, and had long forgotten about it. But his wife secretly copied it and sent it to the editor of the Troy Sentinel. On December 23 of the following year, the poem was published.</p>
<p>Newspapers and magazines all over the world competed to publish this poem. Children's books and school textbooks also selected it. This kind of reader reaction shocked Moore. What was even more moving was that it had become a custom of Christmas celebrations.</p>
<p>Little reindeer, Saint Nicholas, stockings... these well-known Christmas features are all found in Moore's wonderful poem. He seems to have given the world a happy picture, he made thousands of children dream and evoked their childhood memories.</p>
<p>Until now, publishers consider "A Visit from St. Nicholas" to be an immortal work.</p>
<p>Moore thought it was not a moral poem, but it has been praised by children for the past 125 years. Although he has never received any reward for this, that happy Santa Claus will be immortal with the world and will always be a friend of children!</p>
<h3>Three Commemorations</h3>
<p>— Xu Pu</p>
<p>There are many historical events worth commemorating today. In addition to the international Christmas holiday, there are also three major events in China worth commemorating: the Yunnan Uprising; Chairman Mao's escape from danger in Xi'an; and the completion of the National Assembly's constitution-making. Now, I have specially written three commemorative poems to express my sincere joy.</p>
<p>The Yunnan Uprising</p>
<p>The banner to fight the thieves rises from the clouds of Lingnan, The red sun falls in the New China Palace; The theory of national rejuvenation continues, Everyone praises General Cai of Shaoyang.</p>
<p>Chairman Mao's Escape from Danger</p>
<p>The escape from danger in Xi'an is remembered today, The magpies reported the good news in the sound of firecrackers, Never has there been such a day of joy, Even now, the memory is still pleasant.</p>
<p>The Completion of the National Assembly's Constitution-Making</p>
<p>Dignified officials gathered in one hall, The three-chapter covenant was discussed at length; The grand plan for a century is not easy to talk about, This is the beginning of setting the country and stabilizing the nation.</p>
<h3>The Value of a Husband</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In Missouri, USA, a woman hit her family's dog with a baseball bat and was arrested by the police. As a result, the court sentenced her to a fine of one hundred dollars.</p>
<p>A few days later, she hit her husband with the same baseball bat and was arrested by the police again. As a result, the court sentenced her to a fine of twenty-five dollars. (Translated from the New York Herald Tribune)</p>
<h3>Opening Up a Path to Survival</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>The 1947 calendar is quickly coming to an end. This year, the world has been full of disturbances, both startling and soul-stirring. I am exhausted from dealing with it all, and have lost the leisure for contemplation. Not only can I not remember trivial matters that don't concern me, but I am also vaguely aware of what I have done myself. In the course of my life, it can be regarded as leaving another blank page.</p>
<p>In moments of leisure, I often flip through the Annals of Qin. I see that after Ying Zheng extinguished the six states and unified the world, he built the extravagant and peerless Afang Palace. When he was still in his prime, he announced his future tomb on Mount Li. He also fabricated the myth of the alchemist Lu Sheng: "Qin will be destroyed by Hu," spreading the rumor that the northern barbarians would come to destroy China. Immediately, he issued a decree to recruit strong men from all over the world, implementing an unprecedented national defense plan - building the Great Wall for thousands of miles. Why did he start such massive construction so soon after the six states were pacified, without giving the people a chance to rest? It was really because he couldn't manage the armies of the six states. Although the six states were destroyed, the strong men mobilized for the wars of the six states had reached a saturation point. The same was true for the Qin state, and they had to think of a solution. Therefore, the only method was to engage in large-scale construction.</p>
<p>From this historical fact, it can be seen that the politicians of the pre-Qin period were indeed clever. They knew the importance of the unemployment problem after the war, and they knew that if these discharged soldiers had nothing to do and no place to use their strength, they could be used by a few ambitious people as tools for fighting for power and profit. Unfortunately, they should not have engaged in massive construction, building palaces and tombs. Even though those adult men were exhausted and would not rebel, the depletion of the national treasury and the waste of people's labor, which led to the unprecedented poverty of the world, was also the main cause of the demise. If they could have driven these discharged soldiers to the front lines of production, stationed them in villages, planted trees, cultivated mulberry trees, and raised silkworms, and instead of building the Great Wall, they had focused on repairing the Yellow River, which had been a problem since the Qin Dynasty, and instead of building the Afang Palace and the tombs on Mount Li, they had focused on using the strong men of the seven states to open up wasteland, then, it can be asserted that even if Ying Qin's national treasure could not be passed down for ten thousand generations, it would not have perished in the second generation.</p>
<p>Learning from the past is a guide for the future. Starting next year, I hope everyone will do more work that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and broaden the path of life so that everyone can find resources to survive based on their own abilities. As long as people with a skill or art can develop their strengths, do their best, and exchange for the deserved price, they can support the minimum standard of living, and not run into walls everywhere, have no way out, or be forced to take risks and run to their deaths.</p>
<p>Starting next year, I hope that every Chinese person can do a productive job to fill in their own life history. If we cannot open mines and build roads, then if everyone plants a tree on Arbor Day next year, there will be 470 million trees. In the future, the lush trees will be spectacular and a great national wealth. Isn't that better than being idle and saying empty words? Without production, there is no way to survive, and production is more important than everything else. We must not endlessly waste manpower and material resources on non-productive work such as repairing guard doors, building gardens, beautifying city appearances, expanding meeting places, entertainment venues, and hosting grand banquets for domestic and foreign dignitaries... Although it can make a few people busy with these non-urgent tasks and fill their own stomachs, the country and the people will inevitably become more and more impoverished.</p>
<h3>Wandering Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Unexpected Disaster (24)</p>
<p>As soon as Mrs. Lin entered the room, she viciously reached out and slapped her in the face. Seeing that Mrs. Lin started hitting her as soon as she entered the room, Futian quickly put down his things and hugged Mrs. Lin around the waist, shouting, "Qiwan, run! Run!" Having suffered a loss, Qiwan saw that Mrs. Lin was unreasonable and knew she couldn't win. There were also many people surrounding the door, and she was afraid she couldn't escape, so she quickly slipped out through the small door of the bathroom. Seeing Qiwan run away, Mrs. Lin refused to give up. For a moment, she was held tightly by Futian and couldn't break free. In a hurry, she opened her mouth wide and bit Futian's arm three times. Futian felt a pain like being bitten by a dog, and his hands loosened. Mrs. Lin struggled free and picked up a feather duster, chasing after her, shouting, "Where are you running? Block the gate!" Seeing that she couldn't get out of the main gate, Qiwan quickly escaped through the side door. Mrs. Lin led the crowd and followed her out, forcing Qiwan to have no way to go and wanting to drown herself. At this critical moment, she happened to meet Zhuzhai, who relieved the siege. At that time, Zhuzhai repeatedly asked Qiwan, "What's the matter?" She only cried and refused to say, only shouting, "Let me go! Let me go!" Zhuzhai said very sincerely, "Don't say it's you, even a stranger on the road, if I encounter this situation, I will help." Qiwan said, "I don't need help, my life is not good, it's better to die!" Zhuzhai said, "This kind of dark society, there's no reason to talk, don't be sad, I'll send you..." Zhuzhai hadn't finished speaking when Qiwan shouted, "I'm not going back, I have no face to go back!" Zhuzhai saw that her forehead and arms were constantly oozing blood, and quickly changed his words, "Of course you can't go back, I'll send you to the hospital." Qiwan said, "I'm not going either! If I'm beaten and the doctor knows, it's too embarrassing!" Zhuzhai said, "There's no need to tell him, just say you fell off the car and were injured, okay?" Zhuzhai said as he pulled her up the earthen slope. The old coachman, because Zhuzhai jumped off the car halfway and didn't pay the fare, was still guarding the earthen slope. Seeing Zhuzhai helping someone up, he quickly pulled the car closer. Zhuzhai helped Qiwan into the car and instructed the coachman to pull her to Renmin Hospital and give him more fare. Hearing that he would get more money, the coachman excitedly picked up the handlebars and trotted a few steps, but eventually walked slowly because of his old age and weakness. Zhuzhai supported her beside the car, following along, and told Qiwan that there was a Dr. Wei in Renmin Hospital who was a friend of his and lived in the hospital. He would ask him to take a look first. This Renmin Hospital was not far from Shichahai. After a while, Zhuzhai saw a small red brick building with a white lychee-style light bulb at the door, with a red cross painted on it. It was shining brightly in this secluded place. In the silence of the world, this white red cross lamp was very dazzling. Zhuzhai told the coachman to pull the car to the small building with the light. When they arrived at the door, Zhuzhai took out his business card and handed it to the errand boy who opened the door, while helping Qiwan out of the car and into the waiting room.</p>

<h3>Better to Forget Each Other in the Rivers and Lakes</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuwu, Dragon's Birth Painting</p>
<p>Have you been to Jixu Street? There are so few telephones, so many slopes and ridges, and the public buses are so crowded. The people crowded at the bus door are usually pushed into the crowd by the station staff to close the bus door, like a fat, soft book cover being stuffed into a narrow bottle mouth.</p>
<p>Therefore, friends in cultural circles regard visiting friends as a major event, like a country woman with bound feet going to the city to burn incense, requiring courage and spirit.</p>
<p>If it is a friend six or seven miles away, then it is only for the sake of borrowing money to buy rice. People in large cities outside of Chongqing cannot imagine the difficulties of Chongqing's poor people, and they do not understand cultural people walking more than ten miles back and forth to beg for a liter of rice.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, the writer Li Jinming wrote a short story, which is still an excellent masterpiece today, although the title cannot be remembered. The general idea is: a person living in the same house comes to talk to him at night, chatting about many irrelevant things. He leaves, and then comes back after a while, still talking nonsense. He leaves again; only when dawn breaks and he hears the sound of crying from the neighboring room does he realize that the person's child has died. He became seriously ill last night, but had no money to see a doctor, and wanted to borrow money, but he could never bring himself to ask!</p>
<p>Isn't the situation of cultural people in Chongqing the same?</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: "It is better to forget each other in the rivers and lakes than to moisten each other with saliva." However, friends in Chongqing's cultural circles sometimes cannot even use saliva to moisten their companions, because they are already dry-tongued and their gastric juices are exhausted!</p>
<h3>Joint Words</h3>
<p>— Baili</p>
<p>When Mr. Min Zhiting of Gui'an was nine years old, his maternal uncle, Minister Mao, held a banquet for guests at the Yuan Ridge. Mr. Min participated because of his old family connection. Minister Mao composed a couplet and asked the guests to match it, saying: "No moon on the Lantern Festival, how many black lamps, to add color to the rivers and mountains." That day happened to be the day of the Awakening of Insects, and Mr. Min immediately replied: "No thunder heard on the Awakening of Insects, strike several drums, to proclaim authority on behalf of heaven and earth." Minister Mao greatly praised him and married his daughter to him. Xiong Tingbi, the Grand Minister of the Ming Dynasty, first won the first place in the Huguang martial arts examination in the Wanli period, and then abandoned martial arts for literature, and won the first place in the Huguang provincial examination in the Dingyou year of the Wanli period. Therefore, he inscribed on his hall: "Three champions are available in the world, but two top graduates are unique in the world." (Seen in Qing people's notes)</p>

<h3>Reply to a Reader in Wuhu</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Gexin: The China Merchants Bureau does not have a Jiangsheng wheel. There is no "trade office" on any of the China Merchants Bureau's ships. After inquiries, there is no such person named Mao. This matter may be a scam, please do not be deceived!</p>
