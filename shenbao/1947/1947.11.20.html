<h3>我國政府建議召開對日和約預備會議向美英蘇三國提出照會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕外次葉公超，十九日於行政院新聞局主持之記者招待會席上，宣布中國政府致美，英，蘇照會一件，原文如下：「中國政府鑒於遠東之和平及正常狀態亟須早予重建，會就對日和約預備會議之召開，向美，英，蘇三國政府提出如下之建議：</p>
<p>甲，由遠東委員會所有會負國組成對日和約預備會議，該會議應由英國，蘇聯，美國及中國從早商定日期，予以召開，藉以草擬和平條約，並商決與召開最後和平會議有關之事項。</p>
<p>乙，該項會議之表決，均以該會議全體會員國之多數，過去所提爲三分之二多數，現則爲過半數之多數爲之，但該項多數須包括英國，蘇聯，美國及中國之同意票」。該項建議，係以規定遠東委員會之組織及程序之原則爲依據，該項原則曾經構成該委員會之十一個會員國全體贊同。中國政府認爲：擬議中之對日和約預備會議，不應與此原則相違異」。上述建議係由外交部王部長世杰以同樣正式照會分致其他三國外長，該項照會係於本月十七日經由我國駐美，英，蘇三國大使館轉達，照會抄本並經分送美，英駐華大使及蘇聯駐華代辦。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京十九日電〕記者頃向外次葉公超詢問，如初步和會基於中國之建議召開，而蘇聯仍拒絕參加，中國是否出席，葉氏答稱：「由於此問題基於蘇聯之假定熊度，本人碍難答覆」。蘇聯要求由四强起草和約，中國建議與之已有出入，表示中國政府已漸接近美國之立塲，雖中國仍堅持保留四强否決權，一般相信，此點將遭美國之反對。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕王外長十九日上午十一時在外部約晤英大使施諦文，美大使司徒雷登，蘇代辦德林，面致我催促各該國從速考慮我國有關對日和約預備會議主張之正式照會。</p>
<h3>對美國援華計劃主席未發表意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕中央通訊社奉命聲明，合衆社十一月十八日南京電所稱：蔣主席對於美國最近所擬援華計劃會加評論一節，絕無根據。蔣主席對此問題，迄未發表任何意見。</p>
<p>１于斌總主敎訪問美總統美記者呼籲援華</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕天主敎南京總主敎于斌，本日晋謁杜魯門總統，作「禮儀上之訪問」。對總統爲世界和平興繁榮而努力之工作，表示欽佩。（下接二版一欄）</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十八日電〕霍華德系報記者拉摩爾，十八日自華府發出一項消息稱：「國民政府統治下之中國，需要外援，其大部分原因，係由於蔣主席被迫從事恢復東北之消耗戰。東北應爲國民政府所有，係故總統羅斯福在開羅會議時，當向渠保證者也。雖「全部佔有」之條文，未曾列爲開羅協定之一部，但今日華府之官員中，仍有彼時參加締約之人員存在，如國會檢討中國局勢，仍可以令其出席作證。</p>
<h3>魯克斯返京　明日招待記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕魯克斯將軍十九日下午四時半由漢口返京，並即晚證實將於廿一日舉行記者招待會，惟招待會之報告主題仍密不相吿。</p>

<h3>國際銀行官布我未請求貸款</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕國際銀行總裁麥古勞，十八日在記者招待會上稱：中國並未正式向該行請求貸款。渠繩稱：該行行員現正繼續硏究中國局勢，並將其進展情形，非正式吿知中國代表。中國局勢由於財政情形及內亂，極爲複雜。</p>
<h3>中美進行棉貸談判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕中美除正進行大宗貸款之洽商外，正從事棉貸談判，先後已締結者，有三千萬美元及五千萬美元兩筆，物資已分別運華。另一筆數目較鉅之棉貸談判，正由國行與花旗銀行商洽，短期內可望獲致協議</p>
<h3>監委建議國府修正選舉法令</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕監院全體監委十九日午後二時舉行座談會，研討有關監委選舉法令，並提出建議，請求國府予以修正。其建議約爲二點：（甲〕關於設置選舉監督者各監委認爲監委選舉以行政首長爲監督，極易受其操縱，從此選出之委員，恐不易公平行使職權，實違反憲法之本旨，且監委選舉屬於省市議會，事務極簡，議會本身足以辦理，並無特設監督之必要。（乙）關於速署提名之限制各監委以監委選罷法施行條例規定，省市參議員之提名，以一次爲限，使候選人不易得到公平之機會，有妨選賢與能之本旨，故擬請修正爲不限制一次爲限。</p>

<h3>處理日賠償物資史揣克來滬調查　我盼拆卸日發電設備供我利用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕受美國陸軍部委托調査日本賠償問題之史揣克氏，於前晚六時四十分乘美軍專機自韓抵滬，到達後即由此間美軍總部招待，外界知者甚鮮。本市駐日代表團辦事處奉東京商團長來電通知，今晨由莊禺靈會同中國造船廠主任周茂柏及資委會電工專家施洪熙，訪史揣克氏於國際飯店，晤談一刻鐘。周洪兩氏面吿史氏，中國各大城市，包括京。滬，漢口在內，均感嚴重之電荒，目前如向歐美定貨，則交貨及建廠所需之時問，恐需兩三年之久。日本發電設備之性能，恰合我國之需要，希望移一二廠至中國，解決電力之恐慌，特別用於增加煤礦區之電量，以提高其產量。（下接二版一欄）</p>
<h3>我戰時損失船隻已要求日方賠償</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕我政府頃向日方要求賠償戰時船舶損失三二一艘五三〇五〇五噸，造船器材卅萬噸。按我戰前共有輪船三四五七艘，五七六〇〇〇噸，戰時被炸毀及擄捕船隻計江輪二七九〇艘合九九二四七噸，海輪四七艘，合二五〇二七一噸，共二八三七艘，合三四九五一八噸，截至目前止，被擄而經交涉追回者計六艘，餘仍在淸査中。</p>
<h3>立委候選人名額三黨未獲致協議　民社黨監委名單已决定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕民社黨立委候選人名單尙未提出，渠等現堅持與靑年黨相等之名額，故目前備妥之名單，仍爲一二○名。據該黨蔣勻田稱，欲堅持此項名額乃保持將來在立院三分之一否決權之作用，因立委總額七七三名，而民靑兩黨可獲二四〇名，則正爲總數之三分之一。</p>
<p>又余家菊語記者，靑年黨對大選均本一貫方針，故各項候選人名單之提出，極爲順利。至于立委名單至今尙未交出，乃以尙未獲得國民黨對此一二〇名之同意與答覆。</p>
<p>另據閱國民黨頃正擬以現任立院民靑兩黨委員所佔比例，爲下屆民選立委之比例。按現任立委民靑兩黨之和，佔總額六分之一。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國民黨籍現任立委競選問題，有關方面日前曾作商討，決予提名，惟一縣同時有兩現任立委者，其人口若在百萬以上，當可同時提出，但立委在三人以上者，則將由孫院長抉擇。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨於昨日午後召開中常會，審查監委候選人名單，審査完畢後，即交由徐傅霖於昨夜帶京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕靑年黨所提監委候選人名單共卅一名。及本一省一名，一市一名之原則。</p>
<h3>平延慶樓失火選所被焚毀</h3>
<p>卷宗無恙大選照常舉行</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕平市大選前夕，國代·立委選舉事務所，突付之一炬，幸重耍卷宗，均擔運出險，廿一日之平市國代選舉仍可照常舉行。綠北平民政局設於中南海內·其戶政科及臨時成立之國代，立委選舉事務所，即設於懐仁堂背後之延慶樓內。今日該局原定下午三時招待平記者報吿國代選舉籌備情形，不意三時十分延慶樓西樓之二層樓地板下與樓下天花板夾縫巾之電綫突走火，消防隊於起火後十分鐘趕到，惟因該樓全係木製，兼以風大而水源不繼，雖竭力灌救，火勢仍烈，無法遏止，遂將該樓東西走廊及福昌殿一齊燒光。選舉事務所備製之國代投票箱數十個皆被焚毀，幸國代選舉重要卷宗均經冒險搶出故尙不碍廿一日平一六〇萬人之戶口卡片，則均葬火窟。下午五時火勢已殺，惟至發稿時餘燼猶燃。前北京政府時代招待外賓之懐仁堂，適與該處鄰接，經努力阻退，幸未波及。市長何思源曾親臨火塲視察。</p>

<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕中港現正進行兩項協定之商談，一爲中港財政協定，一爲中港關務合作方案，均係針對走私黑市等種種不法事件所提出者，此爲外次葉公超十九日下午三時半在招待會上對記者詢問之答覆。葉氏稱：在我未宣布新的進出口條例前，中港經常保特接觸，自八月十六日新外匯政策公布後，英政府對英鎊集團施以統制，以致財政協定遭受影響而停頓。現悉：英方認爲原則已可接受，技術上則尙待考慮。其次在關務方面者，我方已有提案，惟尙未獲得英方之對案。英大使前曾表示，希望英外部有一對案提出。葉民並稱：現我財部兪某及央行羅吉士已赴港，惟本人不悉是否與此有關。其次葉復就政府對在華韓僑之處置答問稱：凡欲回國者，均協助送渠等返國，否則留我國者，政府亦予以適當之救濟。</p>
<h3>中澳互減關稅澳商長發表報吿書</h3>
<p>〔中央社雪梨十九日電〕澳農商部長鮑拉德，頃發表關于日內瓦關稅協定之報吿書，內稱：中國曾表示願將牛油，乳酪，牛乳，糧食，檀香及檀香粉等物之關稅，减低百分之二至百分之五，中國目前對白蘭地酒之關稅，已减低百分之十，中國並願將羊毛，小麥，麵粉，脂肪，罐頭食物，鐵路枕木，舖砌用之石塊，葡萄乾，及皮革等物之目前關稅，限在百分之五至百分之廿之間：澳洲爲作互惠之表示，乃表示願對在戰前中澳貿易居重要地位之全部商品减低關稅，果爾，則將受影響之主要商品，有桐油，豬鬃，及生絲等，此外，並直接表示願對下列諸物作關稅讓步，即乾蛋白，乾蛋黃，生蛋，製油種子，油餅，髮等及兎皮，草帽辮，銻，爆竹等。該報吿書又稱：由於中國對澳出口之各主要貨物之特別性質，故目前甚難藉適當减低關稅以促進中國對澳之出口，惟澳洲對華貿易，待中國情况較趨正常後可達到互惠發展，而使雙方國家均可獲益。</p>

<p>〔本報蘭州十九日電〕外傳在京召開西北區聯防淸剿會議事，此間迄朱奉到電令，靑省府駐闌辦事處亦未獲得馬主席步芳來闌消息。頃據權威人士語記者，西北聯防淸剿會議似無召開必要，因西北軍權原甚統一，而各將領多在前綫指揮剿匪，將不能分身故也。</p>

<h3>憂患未已的朝鮮問題</h3>
<p>自從期鮮問題列入聯合國第二屆大會議程以後，美國的建議案佔有了優勢，十五日大會通過設立聯合國臨時委員會以監督完成朝鮮獨立一案，便是美國建議案的修正。這個委員會包括八個會員國，除島克蘭拒絕參加外，將以中國，印度，叙利亞，澳洲，加拿大，法國，菲律　，薩爾瓦多爲委員，並規定朝鮮獨立程序：　至遲於一九四八年三月卅一日舉行選舉；　選舉後儘速召開國民議會，以組織統一政府；　由政府自組國軍，並解散不屬國軍範圍內之一切軍事部隊；　與美蘇佔領當局接洽，俾儘可能於政府成立後九十天內完成美蘇駐軍之撤退。根據此項決定，朝鮮的命迷，可算大致已有了眉目。漢城美當局說：聯大決議通過後，美蘇混合委員會及莫斯科協定，已吿壽終正寢。北韓蘇當局則說：聯大決議案是非法的，將拒絕聯合國監察團在朝鮮行使職權。中立觀察家說：由於蘇聯堅持成見的結果，也許韓南將自成一國；北韓如不爲蘇聯所吞併，亦將依　蘇聯而生存。看趨勢，朝鮮問題仍潛在着內憂外患的未來，明年三月前的情况仍禍福難卜。</p>
<p>朝鮮問題，是戰後發生爭執問題之一，也是强　國家角逐塲所之一。强權國家爲什麼角逐朝鮮？地理因素自然大於經濟因素。刺鮮是突出亞洲大陸東南的半島，像一隻巨臂伸向海洋，它曾被認爲通連日本的「陸橋」，與條聯和中國東北接壤，適處於中蘇日之間。它有良好的海空軍基地，從美國軍事地位看，如果控制了朝鮮，日韓地位正如「事軌之相　」；從蘇聯軍事地位看，如控制了朝鮮，「滿」韓地位正如「唇齒之相依」。強練國家的擴張政策，基源於地緣政治，地緣政治決定了朝鮮政治地位的重要性。强權國家自然不能放過朝鮮，於是朝鮮的悲劇開始了。戰後朝鮮之所以有問題，說句老實話，那是閉羅，波茨坦，雅爾達迭次會議及莫斯科的秘密外交，鑄成了的大錯，開羅會議對朝鮮獨立提了有力的保證，但這獨立自由受了「相當時期」的限制。因爲朝鮮獨立尙需「相當時期」，所以彼茨坦會議決定以北緯三十八度爲界，美蘇分別佔領南北；所以一九四五年二月雅爾達會議，羅斯福接受了蘇聯恢復帝俄時代所掠奪得的各權利之要求，損害了朝鮮的完整和生存　益，所以一九四五年十二月莫斯科協定，決定了朝鮮五年託管方案，並設置了美蘇混合委員會來監督朝鮮。這一連串的錯誤，造成了張權國家事後的爭執，把朝鮮人民積年憧憬的獨立自由，變成了不可思議的悲劇。</p>
<p>朝鮮人民本是和藹善良的民族；過去爲反對日本統治，地無分南北，人無分黨派，大家是國結一致的。自日本投降以後，朝鮮新黨粉紛成立，在美蘇兩軍分區佔領之下，形成左右兩大力量，壁壘森嚴，對立尖銳。尤其在北韓，大量軍隊的訓練，隨時堆　　紅色政變，威脋南轉。因而南　不惜對之採取經濟封　，貨物　源，互不通　。　　內部的思想對立，經濟對立，日趨　重，而朝鮮人民尙未能奮起，有所作爲，實爲民族的一大悲劇。這次聯大會議，蘇聯”錢撤軍後再　選舉，美國則深　撤軍後發生紅色政變，使　鮮　爲亞洲之　加利亞。故美國　議先成立民選政府，於國軍解散　　武裝部隊後再撤駐軍；蘇聯則謂外軍佔領之下，進行選舉，似有未　　蘇的爭戰，互相駐辦，都有理由；互不相讓的結果，美國的建議案是佔勝了。但蘇聯集團是以少數而敗北，非謂蘇聯對朝鮮問題有了讓步；事實上蘇聯對朝鮮必更積極，悲痛的仍是朝鮮。</p>
<p>聯大方案的成立，美國在精神上獲得了勝利。美國軍方宣佈美蘇混合委員會及莫斯科協定，從此壽終正寢，這說明了美國將以實際的有效的行動，毀去一九四五年十二月莫斯科外長會議的決定。在法律上，以聯大方案代替五年託管方案，以聯合國臨時委員會代替美蘇混合委員會，從朝鮮獨立前途說，五年託管決定的取消，是有利於朝鮮的；聯合國委員會　較美蘇混合委員會，容易接受朝鮮人民的意志。因此，這一方案自然較莫斯科協定爲合理，並且透過了聯合國公衆意志而產生，自較秘密外交方式爲合法。所可遺憾的，是本方案的成立，未經美蘇協調諒解，尤其蘇聯集團的不合作能度，聲言少數不能服從多數，自必增加聯合委員會許多困難。看莫斯科日來的消息，北韓的行動，朝鮮的新危機，正在滋長，南北的分要，勢難避免。明年三月以前，朝鮮南北是否協調，是否起而團結爲民族自決奮鬥，纔是朝鮮獨立統一前途的一個重大關鏈。</p>
<h3>史揣克來滬調査</h3>

<h3>馬歇爾闡明美外交政策謀恢復歐洲繁榮改造德國防止再起侵略</h3>
<p>〔路透社芝加哥十八日電）馬歇爾國務卿今日向此間外交關係協會發表演說，指責蘇聯從事最無恥而侮辱性的宣傳。並曰，目前已屆應行制止此等刺激性舉動之時期。按馬歇爾兩日後即將啓程赴倫敦出席外長會議，其演說可以透露渠在外長會中所取態度。渠曰，「余將以坦白的頭腦參加此次會議，將盡力覓取協議之完善基堤，不論如何桃撥，余將避免發表僅　宣傳作用之聲明。在重建歐洲安定之整個問題中，德國問題最爲尖銳，但吾人必須審愼，俾使再造後之德國，不致再度威脅歐洲之經濟。德國之絕對必需解除軍備及武裝已無疑義，惟美國前此建議訂立四强四十年公約，以監視德國之不再侵略之建議，迄仍存在。此外，吾人且須確切保證，不使他日之德國政府利用德國之經濟能力，以爲促進純德國政策之武器，此一問題之答案，與魯爾區之未來任務，有首要關係。美國相信必須確立保障，使魯爾區之資源及工業力量，不致由任何德國未來政府所單獨控制，而能用作促進整個歐洲福利之用。在建立適當的保證以後，始可在聯邦制的德國，進行設立臨時中央當局，並最後擬具和約之規定。吾人在倫敦會議中，當依照此等路綫覓取進展。」馬卿繼述及面臨美國之一段外交問題稱，「美國乃歐洲文明之一部。美國及英國正眞誠的努力，求取歐洲之復興。不幸會在世界大戰中有重大貢獻之一第三强國，並不與我分担該一任務，其動機迄尙不明，惟其行爲則雖然在無定期延長當前之不滿意的事態。美蘇間意見之分歧，多數均源出於此，即關於歐洲未來所持目的之不同，並非由於兩國利益之直接衝突，吾人相信欲使歐洲恢復强盛，必須先解決此一問題，然後美蘇間問於歐洲部份之爭執，亦必能减少。</p>

<p>馬卿繼述及美國外交政策及援外計劃之動機，指責蘇聯官員及各地共黨正加緊發動遝動，曲解美國對外政策之用意。渠云，「此等阻撓復興之徒，指責美國具有帝國主義之目標·侵略的意向，並竟欲挑動第三次世界大戰。余欲鄭重聲明，此等指責沒有絲毫的眞實性。吾人並未併吞土地，吾人雖握有最强大的軍力及軍事資源，但並未用以攫取政治上或經濟上之特權地位。美英兩國自戰爭結束以來，已自動减少其在世界各處之主權區，並給予附屬民族以獨立及在聯合國巾之地位。」</p>
<p>馬卿繼曰，「鉅大而複雜之馬歇爾援歐方案，雖尙有未定之因素，然吾人深切了解，苟不冒險以企圖恢復歐洲，實際採取積極行動所冒之危險爲更大。以言馬歇爾方案，决非如外傳之爲推銷美國過剩商品，以防美國之經濟恐慌，此種奇特的指摘，對於渴求生活必需品之歇洲人民，以及手握錢鈔以待購買輸歐物品之美國人民，均異常刺耳。此即宣傳的氣息，本人盼望在外長會議召開以前，能先淸除美蘇間因宣傳而引起的問題。當戰爭結束之初，美國人民對於蘇聯人民陸軍及其領袖，均抱極崇高之景仰態度，今則此種態度已完全變更。蘇聯政府許多挑撥性的行動，均未具任何其他明顯的目標。本人嘗就蘇政府之歷史性質中，企圖求取解釋，結果仍不解何以蘇政府竟故意引起他方憎恨的心理。美國人民忍耐已久，然今則已至忍無可忍，被迫入於積極憤慨之狀態。本人切盼穌聯能制止此種刺激性之手段。」馬卿最後表示，「對本屆聯大中之進展，並不悲觀，聯合國機構雖經過嚴重的掙扎，但余認爲其實力並無嚴重的損失。」</p>
<h3>外長會議程美蘇迄未獲協議</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十八日電〕外長會議於本月廿五日開會時，外長代表尙提出兩個議程表，一爲英美法所提者，一爲蘇聯所提者。前者內容及次序如下：　奧國條約；　德國經濟原則；　德國政治組織；　監視德國非武裝之四强公約；　德國之疆界；　準備對德和約之程序。蘇代表史米諾夫則表示四代表僅須向外長會讀報吿彼等已同意由外長會議討論前述之一·二·三及六項，但並不表示此各項須被採納。</p>
<h3>美蘇外長可能在會外商對日和會程序將正式商談否決權問題</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十八日電權威人士今日語合衆社稱，美國希望在倫敦四外長會議中，能與蘇聯協議舉行對日和會之程序。惟由於中國之不參加外長會議，此問題不能列入議程，然據悉國務卿馬歇爾將與蘇外長莫洛托夫舉行正式談話，力勸蘇聯放棄對和會決議之否決權。但消息靈通之觀察家以爲此事不可能做到，據悉美官員並不特別悲觀，對此問題之美國觀　，據稱根據下列數因素：</p>
<p>聯合國不願蘇聯之抵制通過設立巴爾幹調査國·小型聯大及朝鮮調査團，前車可鑑，如美國不向蘇聯同意參加與否，逕自發出召集和會之請柬，已不再爲創舉，蘇聯業已面臨此局面。　中國至今支持蘇聯對於否決權之立塲，美，官員　認中國顯然有同意吳國立塲之跡象。　美　相　蘇聯不能永不出席和會，如美驪在中國數許後，逕自發生請柬，　聯最後請加以接受在此一方面，美國信賴不列顚聯邦之支持　始終如一。美國最初對此舉棋不定，恐蘇聯抵制會議而決絕分裂，然　於最近之發展，據稱美國相　此事在華盛頓與莫斯一一般分裂上僅爲一小事。無論如何，在馬歇爾與莫洛托夫在倫敦會議之成敗禾卜之前，對日和會請柬不致發生。</p>

<h3>文運會宣似會中　潘議長發表演講　解釋「普選之意義」</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央文化運動委負會上海分會主辦之「潘公展先生競選國大代表宣傳大曾」，於昨日下午五時至八時，在文化會堂分別招待本市文化界人士曁虹口及北四川路區區民代表及保甲長等，由該會副主任委員處文任主席。潘議長蒞臨發表演講，題爲「普選之意義」，略稱：中華民國成立三十六年，但憲政之實施，當自本年即將舉行之國大代表及立委選舉開始，中國國民黨之一黨訓政，亦將因此正式宣吿結束，而</p>
<p>還政於民</p>
<p>此番由人民選擧出來之國大代表及立法委員，即爲將來代表人民來管理國家事務之人物。潘氏又稱：國大代表之任務有二，一即代表人民來保障憲法，二即代表人民選舉大總統。其方式略如一個公司的股東，選出一部份董事來掌握這個公司的大政方針，而由董事會再推選一個總經理出來，執行這個公司的</p>
<p>一切業務。因此凡我國民黨之黨員與信仰三民主義的同胞，如果要想保障我們這部三民主義憲法，而欲推行盡利，則應珍視其選舉權，以良心，以理智，來判斷我理想中能够担當此種責任的人來做我們的代表。繼謂現行的選舉方式是無記名投票，此即絕對民主自由的方式，但應請市民注意者，即不能因此放棄投票，亦不能任意規避，因放棄或規避，在法律上雖不犯罪，但在良心上</p>
<p>有其責任，質言之，如全體選民，皆抱放棄或規避投票之心理，則還談什麽民主，更從何而實施憲政。本人是國民黨員，也是國民黨提名的候選人，各位如若信仰國民黨，而在國民煞提名的候選人中，又看得起本人，則投我的票，但這仍是各位自己的自由。</p>
<p>潘議長講畢，即放映「幸福狂想曲」影片，以娛來賓，又悉：潘議長昨竟日出席各方競選演講，計有六處之多，天蟾舞台昨晚曾邀請潘氏蒞臨演講，潘氏以昨晚夜車晋京，未能出席。</p>

<h3>英雄用形式無地　良駒撫髀興嘆　牠們極願一效犬馬之勞　對主人報恩爲難民盡力</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕上海的先生女士們，咱們一別快三年了。多蒙諸位還沒有忘記，這一時又提起咱來了。當咱第一次聽到市參議會中有人提出「恢復賽馬」時，咱想：英雄又可有用武之地了，虞樂得尾巴兒直翹，可是後來說是咱們　賽屬於賭博的性質，因此作爲罷論，使咱們空歡喜了一塲，結果依舊不能出山。這一回，聽說爲救濟難民的事，又提出咱們來了，但願這次終能成爲事實。咱這多年來閒散無事，眞有脾肉復生之感了；再則瞧那些難民怪可憐的，咱也頗願一盡四蹄之力呢。</p>
<h3>昔日風光而今案在</h3>
<p>咱想起了戰前的風光，不由得　思自嘆了。那時候咱們的夥伴兒有五百多匹，嘯嘯叫叫的在一起多麽有趣，咱的老家原在蒙古，主人把咱買來以後，就在咱屁股上印上年份的記號。所以諸位祗要一望，就可知道咱是那一年到上海的。咱們可並不能濫竽充數，咱們的身高從鬃毛上的山頭量起到前脚的後髁爲止，要在十二呎三吋至十三呎三吋之問，才有資格參加競賽。諸位請勿吃驚，世界上還沒有發現過十二呎高的馬，這裏所謂呎並非眞正的呎，乃是英文叫做Hand，即一隻手從姆指到小指的距離，等於四吋。所以準確的說，咱們的標準高度是十二「手」三吋至十三「手」三吋，祇是習慣上都說作呎罷了。</p>
<h3>養兵千日用在一朝</h3>
<p>身材及格之後，咱們也並不是馬上可以就參加競賽。咱們還得下一番苦工練習。每天淸量，馬夫把咱們牽到跑馬塲，雄赳赳的騎師就騎上咱們跑上半小時一小時，跑得咱們汗流浹背，筋骨可就練出來啦。一方面，咱們吃好的東西，吃大麥，吃麩皮。主人對咱們　以說是愛護備至，這無非是想「養兵千日，用在一朝」而已。</p>
<p>此賽的時候，咱們身上負荷的重量都有規定，咱們高度在十三「手」的，不得少於一百五十二磅，咱的騎師如果祇重一百五十磅，就得加兩磅鉛，上去。咱的夥伴高十二「手」三吋的背上重量不得少於一百四十九磅，十三「手」一吋的，不得少於一百五十五鎊，十三「手」三吋的，不得少於一百六十一磅。這樣咱們的機會均等，跑起來可就毫不含糊。誰奪得頭鰲，誰的主人就可得獎，這正是咱們食祿報恩的時候了。</p>
<h3>希望一日重上賽塲</h3>
<p>除了出售馬票的競賽之外，咱們的主人有時候還舉行純粹競技性的「獵紙競賽。」那可眞是有趣了，所謂獵紙競賽，地點大槪在近郊的鄕區，先有人在起點與終點之間撒佈紙屑，咱門就跟着紙屑的蹤跡前進，有時候需要跳過小浜，有時候需要越過竹籬，有時候撒紙的人故佈疑陣，咱們就得跑寃枉路了。記得有一次咱踐踏了晨田，幾乎引起一塲衝突，後來還是咱的主人賠償了事，報上也有記載呢。</p>
<p>這兩年來馬賽禁止，咱們的命運可就慘了。不少夥伴兒都被主人出賣，「墮落」到去拉馬車，或則供人們騎着玩。咱幸而是「名馬」之一，咱的主人捨不得把咱拋棄，每天早晨還騎了咱上跑馬塲，或則大西路溜上幾圈。可是雖然如此，咱一個月的食用得費去主人二三百萬元，咱心中老是不痛快，總希望有一天能重上競賽塲，好替咱主人掙一個頭獎，揚揚眉吐吐氣。</p>
<p>可是，話又得說回來了，咱希望馬賽重開，可也不全爲了自己，咱也想替難民們盡些力呀！你瞧，西比里亞的寒流不是已經來了嗎！</p>

<h3>蘇北三千里　民衆的心曲　民衆隨駐軍南撤</h3>
<h3>民眾隨駐軍南撤</h3>
<p>由於整個戰略的調整，軍事當風不願意爲了一個　城而拖去了龐大的兵力。十月一日，當局決定了撤退鹽城駐軍。深夜一時，縣政府通知全城民衆，準備撤退，全城除老弱婦孺而外，都不約而同地於黎明集中，由吳文春縣長編隊，隨着駐軍南撤。因爲他們不願意受匪的壓迫，蹂躪，所以這三十餘萬不幸的一羣，不怕飢寒的襲擊，而逃向國軍控制的地帶中來，雖然政府對他們幷沒有一個妥善的安置或救濟。</p>
<p>記者到東台，正是鹽城轉進後的第三天，我看到難胞們領到的那一筆僅有的賑品——蘇寗分署的衣服，拿出來以廉價轉售於人而充盤川的情形，眞令人酸鼻。</p>
<h3>向防務空隙處竄</h3>
<p>目前橫在部隊和民衆內心中的，有一個値得注意的問題，現在國軍採取機動作戰，以擊潰匪的主力爲目的。在現階段部隊不敷分配的態勢下，我們應當相信幷且諒解一個部隊在攻克一個據點之後，是無法久駐的。在短期問內，地方上一切正常了，可是，一等到國軍調走以後，問題就嚴重起來。以奸匪流竄的老套，他是專向空隙處鑽的。他發覺了這裏的防務空虛，沒有正規部隊駐守時，馬上就會集中力量來偸襲。攻陷以後，根據他們的恐怖政策，凡是爲國軍或政府做過一些事甚至和政府人員說過一次話的·就目爲反動份子，殺無赦。雖然，淮海綏區規定了一區或一鄉的自衛隊，在必要撤退之光，應當把婦孺遣送到安全區域，完成</p>
<p>空室淸野工作，可是在情况緊張時，又怎能顧得及？因此，記者聽到很多人的話，他們說：國軍要推進，就務請要久守，否則，爲老百姓着想，不如不推進。事實誠然如是，然而又是怎能辦到？不過，話得說回來，截至現在爲止，說者始終沒有聽說地方上的人不願意國軍推進到他們的家鄕中去的話，他們認爲在政府控制之下的任何情况，總要比奸匪盤踞的時候好上萬倍。所以，只要聽說國軍推進，當地民衆，馬上開始供給情報，協助述輸等工作。</p>
<p>現在記者想轉過筆頭來，談談被脅誘而加入匪羣的民衆。</p>
<h3>目前的感訓工作</h3>
<p>一些肓目無知，被誘惑或脅迫而加入匪羣的民衆，替他們打開一條自新之路，各縣乃有感訓所的設置，負責辦理自新後的感訓工作。</p>
<p>共匪的手段是毒辣的，無情的，他們企圖他們「事業」的成功，企岡爭取廣大的羣衆，於是不惜展開任何手段，來驅使民衆，誘惑民衆，去投入他們罪惡的深淵。可是是非之心，人皆有之，成脅，欺騙，只能收效於一時，只要等到人們發現他們的罪惡的時候，馬上仍然是叵到政府的懐抱中來了，當然，也有極少數是例外。</p>
<p>英國有句諺語：「東好西好，家中最好。」我問過了太多的受着感訓的人們，他們的答覆，千篇一律的都是爲了他們的家，和娘兒們。</p>
<p>很明顯地，在現階段的感訓工作中，存在着一個深刻的矛盾。那就是未附匪的民衆和附匪的民衆彼此問仇視的心理尙未完全消除，因此，有很多內心已　議侮的附匪之人，尙不敢貿然地投向政府的懐抱中來。</p>
<p>在另一方面，感訓的工作很多地方弄得一團糟。由於鄕鎭保長們的敲詐，恐嚇，加深了他們的恐怖心理。一個自新的份子，想要受到「感訓」的道個洗禮，不買通鄕鎭保長這個關節，你今生休想。因爲一般人的心理，好傑經過政府感訓之後，對自己的人格，就多了一層保障。更有一般人民，見到家裏人送到縣城裹去感訓去，以爲等於坐監牢一樣，一家都嚇得哭哭啼啼的。實際上說，有若干縣份的感訓所，也和牢獄相差不了許多。</p>
<p>在幾個月以前的灌雲縣感訓所，因「囚糧」不足，悲劇產生了不少。又因主管人員的行爲不檢，實在人數根本與名册不符，有的在張三的下面註明保釋，結果釋放的却不是張三，而是李四。自鄭森棨縣長接事後，才詳細詢問，將罪嫌較輕的人，立刻釋放。釋放之前，並和他們個別談話，告訴他們：保你們出來的，都是鄕保長，他們對你們很同情，更希望你們出來以後，在工作上多多地協助他們。又介紹他們與當地的區鄕鎭長見面。這樣可以消除他們對鄉保長的隔膜，也可以泯滅他們對鄕保長們的仇恨。這個事實足以說明：感選所不但不能做到感訓工作，並且，速辦得像個監牢都辦不好。在我所看到的縣份中，高郵的感訓所辦得最好。已經辦過好幾期，感訓完畢以後，並協助他們轉業。在高郵受着感訓的自新份子，都長得非常胖，足見他們的營養很好。張冠球縣長問他們：「吃飽飯了沒有？」「吃飽了！」一陣高興的歡呼。</p>
<p>此外，還有一個不可忽視的事實，有若干執迷不悟的人，受了匪軍的麻醉過深·腦筋再也改不過來。有很多的縣份，發現了經過自我或感訓的人，仍舊秘密地與匪互通聲氣，專門供給匪軍以情報。對於這，政府就應當斷然處置，使得人民有所警慯，有匪即無我，有我即無匪。否則，今爲順民；而到了匪軍陣營裏面去的時候，鬥爭，淸算……又無所而不爲了。道樣就足以造成一般人徼倖的心理，他們看穿了政府寬大爲懐的弱點，橫賢被捉去以後，再來一個自新好了，所以今日我們對政府的要求是：有　件的懲兇，有限度的寬大。（特派記者凌松壽）</p>

<h3>京汕等幫力購　華股生氣盎然</h3>
<p>華股昨以圈外黑市狂躍，塲外有京汕兩帮力購，業中大戶雖則進後有出，但空方已有補進，外行游資已有滲入，小股華新景福新光所漲甚速。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>人心平穩，開出榮辱俱微，永紗自三三六元及三三三元開後，曾退至即交三二九元，及遞交三二〇元低價。旋回升至三三八元及三三九元，一七〇號等脫售現永紗，三二號等出　永紗，回低至三三四元左右。中泥掛高至漲停板，塲外息價仍開一角八及二角二分半，一永紗以力售不已，仍被屈居於三三二元光景者殊久，京汕帮在塲外力購，臨收前塲外喊高甚多，業外黑市狂躍，人心又振，升至即交三四二元，遞交三四四元高便，而後經散戶等了結，退至現遞均爲三四〇元收市。結果較前收即交股計中泥漲停後有回，軋升一成。統益永公火柴漲半成，勤興平平，閘北新光景綸景福新華信誼微降，餘均微升。遞交股計新光景福勤興微挫，華豐美亞信和永紗微漲。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>窗外黑市再挺，人心更好，祇做即交，永紗開高至三四四元，夜報載有世界銀行有考慮貸款之訊，開後即低至三四二元，九一號等均進，塲外復有大量買戶爭進，遂漲到三五〇元，七六號等供給而稍回落，國行交換差出，一六號等紛進，永公火柴中泥五和均掛漲停，永紗高價達三五六元，二一三號等趁高出籠，屢次退至三五〇元丙，而後以三五○元之價收市。結果較晨收，即交股計火柴中泥五和永公漲停，華新美亞新光景福內衣升半成，景綸小挫，餘均微漲，塲外各老股計文化股再挺一成，餘尙穩定。</p>
<p>千二百餘石，市討又受塲外物價波動，隨之賡續上揚。粳秈米均見步砌二萬元，白陰元亦升萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉店方納胃加强，客心轉堅，飛騰七八千元。麩皮鄕銷活絡，狂漲萬元。</p>
<p>豆餅廠方心思亦挺，續升二三千元。黃豆客帮油廠繼續收吸，按步挺進，再漲二三萬元。菉豆供求兩少，形勢平定。赤豆續挺萬元。缸豆去化仍活續，漲一二萬元。蠶豆另化轉殷，回高一二萬元。</p>

<p>廠絲</p>
<p>因實銷淸淡，昨日上午甚軟，下午較好，結果與上日喊價無甚上落。C字等級昨做開二檔。七千三百萬元及三百八十萬元，均有成交。高另祖前市做七千一百萬元，下午做七千二百五十萬元，中級另担上午做六千七百萬元，下午九百萬元有成交。干經昨市較硬，普通另担五千萬元有成交。</p>

<p>〔本報訊）中信局對人造絲久未配給，據羅副局長稱：日人造絲五千箱，三二日內即可抵滬，恢復配售。</p>
<h3>外銷綠茶穩定</h3>
<p>內銷茶仍因本街店莊等地之去化，魚貫不絕，故買方猶佔上風，情勢趨秀。至於洋莊茶市，祁門紅茶進出各有，市氣少變。他若向銷非洲之抽珍。珍眉等綠茶，自賣戶鋻於貨稀，售意頻轉堅化以來，出口商雖圖繼續抑價，卒難如願。是以交易迄今陰霾不堪，過程則穩定如故。</p>
<h3>華鋁鋼精廠供應包茶鋼精紙</h3>
<p>華茶出口，對於包裝，通常均用木箱，內襯錫紙。該項錫紙，實係鉛質，並裱以粗劣紙張，不獨有碍衛生，且因人工製成，極易破損，難達防潮之作用，有失美觀，尙其餘事。本市華鋁鋼精廠有鑒於斯，特仿外國包茶方法，創製包茶用鋼精紙一種，以供需求。不獨光輝美觀，輕薄僅及鉛質四分之一，且質堅耐用，可省裱背之費，成本减輕甚多云。</p>
<h3>易貨紙圈第二批中信決統籌辦理</h3>

<h3>說老實話「四强外交秘密」是一部重要文獻</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>聽人家的說話，或者讀人家寫的文章，我往往覺得對於一本新著者的批評，極容易落入兩種日窠，一種是把這本書捧上三十三重天，另一種是把它打入十八層地獄，極少特平的論調。東西各國人士對於貝爾納斯的新著「四强外交秘密」的批評，也不能例外。</p>
<p>讚美這本書的人，認爲它是近年來國際政治方可一本特出的巨著，並且指出了這本書的二大優點：第一，因爲貝爾納斯在羅斯福總統逝世前就參加國際間最機密的政治談判，而在社魯門繼任總統後又是折衝於國際舞台上的美國國務卿，所以他說出了許多一般人所不能說的話；第二，因爲他目前不再與政治發生直接的關係了，以其在野之身良然不必和現在政府擔任要職的人那樣的多所顧忌，所以他說出了許多一般人所不敢說的話。更有人認爲他是爭取全世界民全自由的眞正戰士，一個不屈不撓維護國際正義的巨人，因此他這本著作，也被看作現代外交史中的一本重要經典。</p>
<p>指摘他和他這本著作的人，自然另有一種說法。他們說貝爾納斯是美國資本主義的代言人，說他用一套僞善的語言，歪曲的機密以及他現在已經不再有的地位，來達到他穩藏在內心深處的反蘇目的，說他暗中想和美國國內的主戰派結合預備東山再起，企圖實行制覇世界的政策。世界各國的左翼份子都鵝這種論調，至於蘇聯的報紙和政府高級人員，竟毫不用情地稱呼他是「戰爭販子」。</p>
<p>態度客觀一點的人，對於上面這種趨於極端的說法，是不能隨便加以接受的，因爲這些說話，大都是宣傳家的說話，不是認眞的批評家的說法。宣傳家的主觀成份太重，他們祇知道「黑」和「白」，不知道黑和白之同還有許多深淡不同的程度，祗知這要人家相信他自己相信的，不知道從各種立塲各種角度去接近眞理，更進而去認識眞理。要開卷得益，讀書人非要有從各種角度各種立塲去認識眞理的精神不可。</p>
<p>我時常喜歡從旁觀察人家吵架，然而不願意輕斷是非。根據經驗，大多數的吵鬧，都由立塲不同以致觀點互異而起。「四强外交秘密」一書，其中一大部份，是貝爾納斯和莫洛托夫的幾塲微妙的吵架的記錄。由於美蘇關係的演變是世界局勢的主流，而這幾塲吵架是可以代表美蘇不同的立塲和觀點的，所以內容很可觀，關心世界命運的人應該一讀。事實上，要明際國際政治的眞相，貝爾納斯的著作要讀，莫洛托夫假如有什麽著作也要讀；范登堡和塔虎脫的言論要注意，華萊士和小羅斯福的言論也不肯輕易放過；貝文和艾德禮這輩溫和社會主義者的思想要硏究，保守黨苜領邱吉爾和工黨左翼領袖培文等人的動向也時刻要留心……集台各家的言論，檢討各種政治上的思潮，假如要下判斷，也要在這個時候下判斷才比較切實，才能比較接近眞理。就是拿貝爾納斯的「四强外交秘密」來說，也應該把它和其他各家的說素比較，細心推敲孰是孰非。假如一本書眞有價値，眞正包含着眞理在內，那麼經過道樣比較之後，這價値，這眞理決不會因此而泯滅，反而會更明顯，更具體，更突出的。</p>
<p>美蘇立塲的不同，觀點的互異，是非常明顯的。貝爾納斯在「四强外交秘密」中特別强調一點，就是自從雅爾述會議以來蘇聯的擴張傾向已日趨明顯，共產主義的狂流正以蘇聯爲中心向各方面展開。史述林和蘇方其他要人雖然騰次說兩種不同的經濟是可以並存，甚而可以相互合作的但在美國方面一部份人士看來，「言」是一樁事情，「行」是另一椿事情。蘇聯旣然認爲共產主義爲世界的最後歸宿，那麽就是暫時和資本主義國家合作，也祇不過是一種手段，不是目的，所以美國是不能信任的。此在蘇聯，則以爲美國雖以民主政治和自由競爭爲標榜，但是自由競爭發展到相當程度容易轉成獨佔，經濟上獨佔的結果，對內可能引起自由競爭的日趨衰微，對外可能引起世界市塲的爭奪，甚至戰爭。在「四强外交秘密」這本書中，美蘇間道種基本矛盾，很明顯地表現了出來。</p>
<p>同樣一個形體，從一種角度看或許是方的，從另一種角度看或許是長方的，再從另一種角度看或許又是另外一種形式；同樣一座高山，從地面上看是高　入雲，而從飛機上看又扁平如一個土堆了。立塲不同，所看見的世界萬物也有了出入。美蘇的立塲是不同的，所以衡量對方的尺度也不同，政策的決定也自難一致。由於問題的複雜牽涉的衆多，，草率的下判斷，或者把事情看得太簡單（Oves-simplifica-tion），決不是一個探索眞理的人所應持的態度。眞理不是一舉手一投足可以獲得的，而應該從多讀，多思索，多觀察中得來。牛頓發現了有關動力的三大定律，但是愛因斯坦根據相對論加以修正，於是更接近了眞理一步。科學家這種勇敢的精神，也應該是硏究國際政治者應有的精神。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯是美國前國務鄕，在他任期之內，適逢美蘇阱係從戰時合作轉變到平時反而劍拔弩張的階段，「四張外交秘密」這本書，反映出當時轉變的過程。就事論事，應該是現代外交史中一部份重要資料。</p>
<h3>老實話</h3>
<p>— 鄧樹勛</p>
<p>貝爾納斯的名著「四强外交秘密」，原名「老實話」，在這裏，貝氏自稱已講了老實話。</p>
<p>在他的「老實話」中，貝爾納斯是否巳講了老實話，不得而知，（事實上祗有他自己知道）不過，因爲他强調這次已講了實話，簡接可證明他以節講的並不是老實話，同時更可證明外交家詞令的不可靠。比「美國內慕」更暢銷的</p>
<h3>「四强外交秘密」</h3>
<p>— 勞戚</p>
<p>據美國拍來電訊：前任美國國務鄕貝爾納斯所著「四強外交秘密」一書，（原名老實話）自十月十五日出版以後，銷行驚人，已超過根室所著「美國內幕」一書。</p>
<p>這本書的成功，並不是偶然的，在這本書內，貝氏用老老實査的筆法，老老實實的洩露了四强在勝利前和勝利後歷次外交會談中的秘密。誠如美國一般書評所說，它是現代外交內幕的紀實，同時也暗示今後美國國策的趨向。</p>
<p>這是一本必讀的外交史實。現在把它作一簡單的介紹。全書共三百十六頁，共分五節，每節分四段。目錄如次，　危機的警覺與責任；　雅爾達—三强團結的高潮；　局勢開始轉變；　波茨坦—功敗埀成；　在倫敦的挫折；　莫斯科會議成僵局；　倫敦曾議一次，巴黎兩次；　巴黎和平會議及紐約和會；　中歐—嚴厲的試煉；　行動的途徑；　　向亞洲和平邁進；　　建立人民外交政策；　　原子能的管制；　　蘇聯追求的是什麽？　　我們今後往那裏去？</p>
<p>第三節末段「向亞洲和平邁進」述及中國部份。劈頭一句，貝氏用開門見山的筆法寫：「我們不要忘記第二次大戰是在太平洋爆發的。」他這一句話說明了亞洲在現階段危局的重要性。他接着又說：「假使我們認爲歐洲可能成爲世界大戰的導火綫，那末，我們就必須把亞洲看做一團很大的火熖。這眞是一針見血的中肯之言。</p>
<p>關於中國部份，貝爾納斯寫道：「中國距離和平，依然遙遠；所可言者，即中國已處於互大變化之邊緣上，我們應在可能範圍內，予此項變化以鼓勵及援助。中國需要我們的技術援助，但地中國應負執行的責任，以求達到成功。」在這裏，他說明了美國援華的重要性，，這也是其他美國領袖所瞭解的一點，但是最近的三億貸款，實在是太令人氣短。</p>
<p>員爾納斯又說：中國的重要性，不單是美國所瞭解，即蘇聯也很明白。在這方面，他透露蘇聯對中國的企圖。他證明在雅爾達會議中，史達林表明蘇聯參戰的代價，那就是共同管理東北兩大鐵路，把大連變爲自由港，並在旅順設立海軍根據地。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯並叙述他與史達林直接晤談的情形。關於這方面，貝爾納斯說：「我告訴史達林說：蔣主席的政府是中國唯一可能的政府。中國共產黨並非眞正共產黨。史達林在答覆中承認國民政府是合法的政府。最令人感覺興趣的是史達林認爲毛澤東對共軍實力過份誇張。當貝納爾斯吿訴他說，毛澤東自誇在天津一帶有六十萬兵力的時候，史達林不禁大笑幾聲。」</p>
<p>對於亞洲的結論，貝爾納斯是這樣的看法：「美國本身的安全以及世界和平，都繫於亞洲的進步」。這當然又是非常準確的看法。自對德勝利以後的兩年中，貝爾納斯百折不回的爲和平而奮鬥。他一共走了七萬七千哩的路程，他從一九四五年一月以迄一九四六年十月一共參加過八次重大會議，即：　一九四五年一月廿二日至二月十二日雅爾達三强會議；　七月六日至八月七日波茨坦會議；　九月四日至十月八日倫敦外長會議；　十二月十二日至廿九日莫斯科外長會議，　一九四六年一月七日至廿五日在倫敦舉行的聯合國全體大會，　同年四月廿三日至五月十八日巴黎外長會議；　同年六月十三日至七月十四日巴黎外長會議；　同年七月廿七日至十月十七日的二十一國和平會議。這一部名著，已由申報同人集體編譯完竣，筆者已過目一遍，譯筆思實，琉利，美麗，不日由新聞天地發行，預約處在本報。</p>
<p>我鄭重向關心四强縱橫捭闔的人們介紹這一本名著和優秀譯作。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯的秘密</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>當馬歇爾將軍從中國回去出任國務卿的時候，各通訊社裏傳出了一個很有意思的消息，說是他的前仟員爾納斯已經進備好了厚厚一大本極端秘密的「藍本」，馬歇爾祗要照書行事，決無舛錯。許多新聞記者鑽頭覓縫的想知道這本「藍本」裏倒底說些什麽東西，然而，接一連二的失敗，終於使他們那顆火熱的心冷了下來。</p>
<p>貝爾納斯在外交界本來素有能言善辯，坦白直爽著名，從這本「四强外交秘密」裏，也多少看得出他的個性。常然，這本書未必就是留給馬歇爾的那些材料，但是，他的坦白直爽的個性，倒底使他透露出了許多機密的材料—而且，從這些機密材料裏，我們不難探出了更多機密的綫索。世界政治成爲强權政治（Power　ploitics）的時候，許多弱小的國家和民族就成爲討價還價時的犧牲品，爲了不要損害這些弱小國家民族的自尊心，於是一切都在幕後活動，一切都成爲機密。這些機密一旦大白於天下的時候，人們才恍然是誰散佈了糾紛甚至戰爭的種子，然而，往往已經太遲了。</p>
<p>知道這些機密最多的人，當然是負責國際折衝的外交家，尤其是總綰一國外交的外交部長。貝爾納斯毅然寫下這本書，在後世治史的人看來，是留下了不朽的功績的。我欽佩貝爾納斯的勇氣，因爲，這本書問世以後，他的外交生涯大槪也就永無恢復之一日了。</p>
<h3>「老實話」的作者具爾納斯</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>貝爾納斯原是卡爾萊斯頓律師事務所中的小職員。他利用工作之暇，學速記，讀法律，終於成爲合格的律師。此後，他辦過報，當過法官，慢慢地一步步走上了政治舞台。第一次歐戰期間，他是海軍次長羅斯福最親密最信任的助手。一九三二年羅斯福競選總統，他是幕後的唯一重要人物。他雖不廣播，不演說，不寫文章，很少在公開的塲合露面，但他按着美國政治的脈搏，引導着美國政治路綫的發展。</p>
<p>羅斯福走進白宮以後，貝爾納斯還在參議院。一九四一年，被任爲最高法院院長他和美國其他政治問題的關係，表面上暫時吿別了。其實，他仍是羅斯福最親信的幕僚，許多問題的決定和進行，還諮詢他的意見。一九四三年，貝爾納斯祖任經濟平準局局長，才是他在走向環球戰爭的美國政治舞台上，開始祖任實際的工作。後改任戰時動員局局長，成爲美國國內戰綫上的最高指揮官。一直到勝利以後，他選是由於國務卿的聯務，波奔於大西洋兩岸，在國際壇塲上折衝，來爭取世界的和平。</p>
<p>在以前幾次的國際會議中，僵局是打開了，對立的意見是協議了，貝爾納斯雖可說得到一些成功，這是他無數苦口婆心的結果。「四强外交秘密」，這是貝爾納斯參與列次會議的經過，不僅是會塲中的寫照，會塲以外的秘密，各國玩弄的手段，多有詳細的記載。國際問的關係本來是够複雜的，勾心鬥角，爭奇制勝，戰後的世界，更顯得錯綜玄妙。貝爾納斯如何在國際關係中，打開這僵持的局面，在「四强外交秘密」中，完全把它揭露出來。從「四强外交秘密」</p>
<h3>從「四强外交秘密」看蘇聯的外交作風</h3>
<p>— 君默</p>
<p>二次世界大戰發生後，很出了幾部關於外交內幕方而的書，它們都是親當折衝之任的人所寫的，如英前駐德大使漢德森的「使德辱命記」，美前駐日大使格魯的「使日回憶錄」，以及前駐蘇大使蒲立德的「使蘇記」等等。這些書都寫得文筆生動，各有共價値，不過也都有着一個共同的缺點，就是：那裏面所記述的事情，此時讀來都已成「明日黃花」，使我們覺得難有作爲參考借鏡的價値。只有上月中旬在美出版前國務卿貝爾結斯的「四强外交秘密」（原名「稅老實話」）一書，它記述的人物，如杜魯門·史達林·莫洛托夫·貝文，都是正在政治舞台上執掌樞紐的人物，而書中所描寫的外交秘幕，歷次市要會議中的討價還價，以及對歐善後，對華外交等等問題，都是至今尙在發展巾，沒有得到解決的。國際會議的實際內幕，我們木無緣得知，但讀了這本書，就似自己也和杜魯門，史達林等人同坐在桌前一樣，今天聽他們爭得面紅耳赤，明天又看他們杯酒言歡。而且，也可以由這本書中，瞭解我們今日所面臨的許多外交難題，尤其是對蘇和柬北大連等問題，究竟是怎樣　變得來的。</p>
<p>這本書眞如書名所示，「說老實話」，把一切和盤托出，不帶火氣，不存偏見，但於事實則毫不隱瞞，所以此書出版以後，許多人都批評作者，說不應如此平地把這許多事實洩露出來。但由此，亦可想見這本書的價値如何了。</p>
<p>作爲一個中國人，我們當然對於書中鵝關中國的部分，和蘇聯的外交作風等等，極表注意。要瞭解蘇聯的作風，我覺得這本書倒是極有帮助。我們這裏且隨便舉幾個有趣味的創子，以見一斑。</p>
<p>譬如賠償問題，蘇聯軍隊到了東北，把我們東北的機器和物資搬走了，工廠都剩下空壳。他們却說，這些都是他們的「戰利品」。在歐洲，情形也是如此。蘇軍攻入羅馬尼亞以後，德軍潰退了，羅馬尼亞油田原有很多英美商人的產業，包括極貴重的機器在內，這些機器，德軍佔領之時曾加凍結，後來德國投降，羅馬尼亞解放了，貝爾納斯就向莫洛托夫提及，要索回這些英美人的產業，但蘇聯不肯，他們的理由是很滑稽的，他們說：這些機器許多是戰前英美商人向德國廠家訂購的，所以上有「德國製」的商標。這些機器從前旣是德國製造的，那末就當然不是英美人的，所以是戰利品，可以沒收。戰利品的定義，原以戰爭中所獲得敵人的作戰物資爲限，但結果，柏林屋子裏的傢俱沙發花瓶也全被蘇聯軍官搬走。道樣一來，賠償問題根本就無法計算數目了。美國方面把這事質問蘇聯，但蘇聯却另有一套莫明其妙的說法，竟會把鋼琴·沙發。花瓶之類也會解釋是作戰物資，所以常以戰利品論，弄得美國的賠償專員鮑萊氣得目瞪口呆，半響說不出話來。</p>
<p>還鵝一件事情，舉出來也可見對蘇聯辦外交，應採取怎麼一種態度。波茨坦會議時，爲了好幾個問題，蘇聯堅持已見，不肯讓步，盾來要無結果而散了。貝爾納斯想出了一個辦法，把美國堅持的兩件事情，和蘇聯所希望要解決的賠償問題放在一起，三件事情併成一個議案，並說明了美國所可能接受的最大限度，然後要蘇聯決定，要同意就三事一齊同意，要反對就三事一齊反對。如果反對，則美國代表第二天就離波茨坦返國，會也不開了。史達林起先大不滿意、認爲貝爾納斯不憑「施此狡計」，爛蘋菓好蘋菓一堆賣，所以要求個別討論。但貝爾納斯却堅持定要一併討論，結果，史達林因爲捨不得賠償問題的不解決，所以只好三樣都同意了，會議於是急轉直下，圓滿結束。貝爾納斯起先以爲史達林爲此事一定對他很不高興，却不料剛剛相反，會議結束，雙方舉杯互祝之時，史達林却特別向杜魯門提出，感謝並欽佩貝爾納斯的努力，使事情得以順利解決。</p>
<p>書中還有許多例子，都可證明：俄國人是吃硬不吃軟的。凡是你讓步時，他就得寸進尺，而且永無止境；但到你堅持立塲，不爲動搖時，他就對你欽佩，而自己讓步了。</p>
<p>這是本書作者美前國務卿貝爾納斯在辦理對蘇外交中親身體驗得來的經驗，這個經驗，對我們今日還是極有參考借鏡之價値的。　美蘇英法四強外長，自右至左，美國前國務卿貝爾納斯，蘇外長莫洛托夫，英外相貝文及法外長皮杜爾</p>

<h3>伊麗莎白婚禮珍聞</h3>
<p>— 林林</p>
<p>伊麗莎白公主大婚，行列自白金演宮至威斯敏斯特寺，沿途房屋有窗戶者，供以高價出租，其利益已超過一九三七年加冕大典。</p>
<p>在白廳那邊，能看到行列的二三分鐘，二扇窗的租價，已高至一百鎊。當加冕時全間房間的租價也祗是五十鎊，據一房主估計，地的一間房，年租祗有百鎊。如今以九百鎊高價，租給二十二個人，換句話說，每人四十鎊。窗戶每隻坐位租價也迷七十五鎊。</p>
<p>蘇格蘭塲通知各房東，凡是買到窗戶看行列票子的人，都須　　局留下姓名。</p>
<p>伊麗莎白結婚蛋糕的式樣已經公主同意，糕分四層，第一　是新夫婦的　章，溫莎別　，波爾莫洛爾別數，及白金漢宮圓椽。第二　　公主膺溫莎自由市民銜時所獲的手飾匣。公主以衛隊長身份閱兵，馬泰本角戰役，各種音樂符號，及各種體育運動的圖案。第三層是一個愛神，手特上畫新夫婦名字縮寫的牌盾，皇家海軍徽章，輔佐隊及婦女隊的　章，及蒙巴頓上尉當服役以參加馬泰本角戰役的主力　勇敢號等圖案。第四層是自治領的國徽，即澳洲，加拿大，南非，紐西蘭，印度及巴基斯坦等國。</p>
<p>英國慣例，女王嫁後仍然從父家的姓，但所生子女都從夫家的姓。因此維多利亞成了漢努佛族的最後一人，而她的兒子愛德華第七世却成了撤克西，柯堡，哥德族的第一人。但朝代名號亦可以勒令更改，像一九一七年英王族即改姓爲溫莎。故此，英皇室將依魯姓溫莎，而伊麗莎白的兒女則姓蒙巴頓。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>伊麗莎白——結婚前夕種種</h3>
<p>— 破輪</p>
<p>十一月二十日是英國伊麗莎白公主和蒙巴頓上尉結婚的日期，舉行大典的地點是威斯敏斯特寺。這個婚禮是英國歷史上一件大事；因爲伊麗莎白公主不但是英國王位的繼承人，根據威斯敏斯特法令也是加拿大，澳洲，紐西蘭和南非聯邦各王位的繼承人。</p>
<p>婚禮是相當隆重的，以逢到戰後英國不景氣，一切都撙節了，但已够炫耀了。籌備大典的工作落在職位居宮廷之首的內大臣，工作確實十分繁雜。這位大臣就是年已七十的克拉侖頓勛爵，他曾主持過宮廷典禮幾百次了。在他的朝服後面拖着一把刺繡的鑰匙，表示宮室的鑰匙都歸他掌管。</p>
<p>這次婚禮不能和國家大典相等，是屬於半國家大事。所以王室婚禮的全部儀典雖將予遵行，但比起完全的國家大典，儀式就减少了。這項決定的最重要和顯著的結果，是男賓毋須着起精製金滾邊上衣，　膝短褲和捲邊帽的朝服，無論晨服，軍服或甚至於便服都是合式的；女賓將着下午服，戴帽，衣裙的長短聽各人自便。</p>
<p>但伊麗莎白公主屆時將和英王國家大典儀仗，乘四馬敞車，旁隨全班馬夫，從王宮赴寺行禮；而新郞也將用馬車儀仗，英后和瑪格蕾特公主亦然。至於儀仗啓行和到寺的準確時間，亦是克拉侖頓勛爵要決定的細節之一。約有二千份光景的觀禮請柬正在分發之中。這些請柬頒發給一些人是一件略有困難的事。自然王室和新郞的家屬都得參加，還有英國內閣諸閣員和反對黨各領袖，以示政治的畛域與喜事無關。所有在倫敦的外交使節，無論大使，公使，代辦也必須接到請柬。不列顚聯邦駐倫敦的高級專員亦然，聯邦總理雖未必個個出席，也總有幾個親臨觀禮。歐陸諸王室的請柬已於上月三十一日發表了，名單是挪威國王，羅馬尼亞國王，丹麥國王及王后，南斯拉夫亞歷山大皇后，西班牙歐琴王后，南斯拉夫瑪麗太后。比利時査爾斯王子；荷蘭朱麗娜公主及白赫德王子；瑞典太子及公主；希臘愛屈羅王子，希臘喬治王子及公主，希臘克利斯福王子，希臘歐琴公主，丹麥愛克斯爾公主及伯萬王子及公主，丹麥喬治王子，丹麥費愛王子，盧森堡約翰王子及伊麗莎白公主。至西敎敎堂禮堂新聞記者席殺有一百另三座，其分配是不列　聯邦報紙二十二席，外國報紙十三席，美國報紙十二席，英國報紙五十七席。</p>
<p>因爲缺乏木材，鋼鐵及人工，街頭上將沒有如加冕禮時的華麗的裝飾，沿途也不設看台。威斯敏斯特寺也沒有特別的裝飾。但英國的孩童却能接到一包食物。</p>
<p>大典是一定要舉行宗敎儀式　，主持儀式大槪是坎特布萊大主敎，從旁囊助的是約克大生敎。</p>
<p>慶賀婚禮沒有舞會，因爲糧食部規定社交活動賓客以一百人爲限。爲了加緊出口計劃，至國沒有公開假日，然而學校却放假一日。</p>
<p>國王喬治六世，打破二百五十年來的傳統，決定接受英國的羅馬天主敎會在公主婚禮時所致的效忠之詞。因爲自英王詹姆斯二世（天主敎徒）於一六八九年退位後，羅馬天主敎徒，包括紅衣主敎，生敎等，不能向英王直接致獻詞。</p>
<h3>冬賑感言</h3>
<p>— 聽秋</p>
<p>各界慈善人士和社會局主辦的冬賑勸募，連日遊藝界諸君，正在播音義唱。各盡「出力一的責任；代窮人呼救，求「有錢」的解囊！</p>
<p>社曾局原定在電影票價上，附微百分之二十的冬賑捐。這辦法；原是爲賑濟貧民，使賑款收入增加，使貧苦的人民，可以多喝一杯粥湯！</p>
<p>無奈影片商人，祇圖本身的利益，對附捐竭力反對；雖然社會局長一再堅持，强制徵收。但，那裏鬥得過，握有實權的影片商人？他們竟聯合表示，倘決意徵收賑捐，寗願抽回影片，停止放映，以爲反抗。</p>
<p>電影附收賑捐，已打銷了原議，另訂辦法。賑款的收入上，勢必受到影響。</p>
<p>繼著：冬賑賽馬，定然又是一個不得實行的空議。</p>
<p>瞧吧！萬國體育會，已放出了先聲。托詞：因爲多年的停頓，一時不容易召集和整理。意思就是說：不願幹沒有利益，空是「出力」的賑賽。所以冬賬賽馬，能否果　實行，還是沒有把握。</p>
<p>千苦萬苦，苦了飢寒交迫的窮人，冬賑勸募上，受了雙重打擊，賑款收入，難免不受影響。</p>
<h3>爬樹的魚</h3>
<p>— 林梅</p>
<p>「緣木求魚」，這是中國的一句成語，意思就是我們要捉到魚，必須要到水中去，如果我們攀到樹木上去求魚，這是路走錯了，魚是不會得到的。這話當然是不錯的。然而，要知道世界是一個奇異的世界，你走的路儘不妨是兩條，但達到的目的可以是一個。比方，侵略者用武力可以達到了他侵略的目的，但你用政治的方式，或是經濟的力量去向人侵略，這也可以得到了和武力同樣的目的的。這就叫做「殊途而同歸」。</p>
<p>捉魚必須要向水中，但爬到樹上去也可捉到魚的。朋友，你看了我這樣的話，一定要感到奇怪嗎？不必！天下之大，無奇不有，走在陸上，爬在樹上的魚不是沒有的。比方，我們走到鄕野去，不必談什麼冷僻而大家地圖上不易找到的地方，就以上海的近郊而論，鄉間小河之中，時有一種在水中出來在河邊濕地上跳走的小魚，這種小魚，鄉人稱之爲「鱸河」，而科學名字叫做蠑螈，那麼，陸地行走的魚也不是沒有了。</p>
<p>在西印度羣島，有一種魚叫做「攀魚」，牠有一種特別的習性，每隔了一個相當的時候，就要爬出水面米，走上陸地，散步一回。有時，在河邊的樹根上，也要像頑皮的小貓般向上爬一回。不過，牠爬不多高，僅僅祇有幾英寸，牠和旁的魚一樣的沒有脚，用着牠的　把身子站了起來。</p>
<p>這不是瞎說，這種魚的標本我們在博物館中可以看到的；如果你住的附近有水族館的話，你在水族館中可以看到活動的魚呢！要是你住處沒有水族館，那你在三四月的時候，在上海近郊的小河中，也可以見到一種行走陸地的嶸螈，牠也能爬上樹根幾英寸，不過牠的形狀，和我們平日吃的魚不大相同吧了。然而，這就可以證明魚是可以爬樹的，「綠木」，也許可以「求魚」的了</p>
<h3>燈下雜記　太史公是何科進士</h3>
<p>— 風人</p>
<p>王漁祥香祖筆記有這樣一則</p>
<p>「宋荔裳方伯在熟讀書時，有岸然而來者，則一老榜甲也。問：「小兒讀何書？」以史記對。問：「何人所作？」曰：「太史公」。問：「太史公是何科進士」？日：「漢太史，非今進士也」。遂取書閱之，不數行，輒棄去曰：「亦不見佳，讀之何益？乃昂然而出」。這在今日當然是個笑話，但當時却的確是一個很普通的事實。科舉取士，原是爲的要束縛士人的思想，使之專在子日詩云的所謂經義裏打圈子，而並不是要他們去從歷史裘照出自己的原形來的，所以，進士不讀史，實在亦不足爲怪。</p>
<h3>漢朝的影戲</h3>
<p>— 朱力</p>
<p>漢武帝之妃子李夫人，容貌甚好，故殊得帝之愛幸。李死後，帝時思念不絕。其時，有方士齊人少翁者，言能致其神，帝信之，觀其爲之，而果見美女如李夫人之貌，帝見而更相思悲感，曾作詩日：「是邪？非邪？立而望之，偏何姍姍其來遲！」</p>
<p>至於方士如何爲之，在漢書上有如下之記載：「方士齊人少翁言能致其神，迺夜張燈燭，設帳帷，陳酒肉，而令上居他帳，遙望見好女如李夫人之貌，還幄坐而步，又不得就視……」</p>
<p>看了上面的「夜張燈燭，設帳帷」之句，就可想見其法和影戲之理相同矣。</p>

<p>「勝利花園」Victory　Garden是第二次世界大戰中的產物，美國人民並不是時花民族從事園藝由於「實迫處此」，因爲戰時一切食糧都受到統制，罐頭食物被統制得尤爲嚴格，美也不會餓死，戰事開始，大量罐頭運往前方，老百姓買不到足量的食料，祗好在屋前屋後把土靶鬆了關爲園地，向雜貨舖買回一包一包的種籽，大事墾殖起來，那種籽品類繁多，無慮數百種，每包一角，包面彩色印就內容，任憑挑選，居家通常均種植洋柿子，靑椒，茄子，珍珠米，芹菜，瓜果，兼　雞鴨，如此一方可減輕家庭負担，一方可鼓勵家庭勞作，節省消磨於電影院夜總會酒排間的光陰以從事生產工作。</p>
<p>美國小姐把勝利花園看得非常重要，好得「勝利」二字預示「抗戰必勝建國必成」，勝利花園最重大的意義，乃在使歡十萬抗戰軍人眷屬，當丈夫在海外浴血抗戰，生死存亡莫卜之際，把寂寞空間的哀感光陰可消磨一大部分在園藝方面，藉此可以淸心寡慾，靜候丈夫凱旋團圓。所以勝利在園是戰時道德上建有極大的功　，這種無形的道德關防比「滿口仁義道德」肚皮男盜女娼」的吃道德飯者的宣傳哄騙，要實效得多，一個在海外出生入死的戰士，一旦解甲歸田，所最引爲心滿意足的是兩件事：第一件自己的老婆沒有跟人逃走，還有王田可耕；第二件屋後有　個勝利花園，可以嘗試「採菊東籬下」的幽悠歲月，藉此忘掉前綫劈刺肉搏的慘酷經驗，榮譽軍人的希望寄託在那里呢？他要一個忠貞的老婆，一所安靜的住宅，一個靑靑的菜圃，美國軍人三件事都如願以　了。</p>

<h3>Our Government Suggests Holding a Preliminary Meeting for the Japanese Peace Treaty and Submits a Note to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao, at a press conference held by the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau on the 19th, announced a note from the Chinese government to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The original text is as follows: "The Chinese government, in view of the urgent need to rebuild peace and normal conditions in the Far East as soon as possible, hereby submits the following proposals to the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union regarding the convening of a preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty:</p>
<p>A. A preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty should be composed of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission. The meeting should be convened by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China at an early date to draft a peace treaty and decide on matters related to the convening of the final peace conference.</p>
<p>B. All votes at the meeting shall be decided by a majority of all member states of the meeting. The previous requirement was a two-thirds majority, but now it is a simple majority. However, the majority must include the affirmative votes of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China." The proposal is based on the principles governing the organization and procedures of the Far Eastern Commission, which have been unanimously approved by all eleven member states of the Commission. The Chinese government believes that the proposed preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty should not deviate from these principles." The aforementioned proposals were sent by Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh in the same formal note to the foreign ministers of the other three countries. The note was transmitted through our embassies in the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on the 17th of this month, and copies of the note were also sent to the American and British ambassadors to China and the Soviet chargé d'affaires in China.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] A reporter asked Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao whether China would attend if the preliminary peace conference were convened based on China's proposals, but the Soviet Union still refused to participate. Yeh replied, "Since this question is based on a hypothetical stance of the Soviet Union, I am unable to answer." The Soviet Union's demand that the four major powers draft the treaty differs from China's proposal, indicating that the Chinese government is gradually approaching the position of the United States. Although China still insists on retaining the veto power of the four major powers, it is generally believed that this point will be opposed by the United States.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Foreign Minister Wang met with British Ambassador Steven, American Ambassador Stuart, and Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Derin at the Foreign Ministry at 11:00 a.m. on the 19th, personally delivering our formal note urging their respective countries to consider our position on the preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Chairman Has Not Expressed Opinion on US Aid Plan for China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Central News Agency is instructed to declare that the United Press Nanjing dispatch of November 18 stating that Chairman Chiang had commented on the recent US aid plan for China is completely unfounded. Chairman Chiang has not expressed any opinion on this matter to date.</p>
<h3>Yu Pin, Archbishop, Visits US President and Appeals to US Journalists for Aid to China</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 18th] Yu Pin, the Catholic Archbishop of Nanjing, paid a "ceremonial visit" to President Truman today, expressing his admiration for the President's efforts for world peace and prosperity. (Continued on page two, column one)</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Howard newspaper reporter LaMoore sent a message from Washington today saying: "China under the rule of the National Government needs foreign aid, largely because Chairman Chiang is forced to engage in a costly war of restoration in the Northeast. The Northeast should belong to the National Government, as President Roosevelt assured him at the Cairo Conference. Although the clause of "full possession" was not listed as part of the Cairo Agreement, there are still officials in Washington today who participated in the treaty, such as congressional reviews of the situation in China, can order them to attend and testify.</p>
<h3>Rooks Returns to Nanjing, to Host Press Conference Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] General Rooks returned to Nanjing from Hankou at 4:30 p.m. on the 19th and confirmed that he would hold a press conference on the 21st, but the topic of the conference remains a secret.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 19th] The US military advisory group leader Rooks and Fang Tian of the Ministry of National Defense and others visited Wuhan University this morning, exchanging views with President Zhou on the new military school system, and after a lunch hosted by Director Cheng of the Office of the Commander-in-Chief, they flew to Nanjing on the original plane. It is reported that the new military school trains modern officers for the army, navy, and air force, divided into thirteen departments, with equal emphasis on science, engineering, and military affairs. Students admitted must not have any party affiliation. Upon graduation, they will be awarded a Bachelor of Science degree by the Ministry of Education and become second lieutenants in the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<h3>International Bank Official Announces China Has Not Requested a Loan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] International Bank President McCraw stated at a press conference on the 18th that China has not formally requested a loan from the bank. He also stated that bank staff are continuing to study the situation in China and are informally informing Chinese representatives of their progress. The situation in China is extremely complex due to financial conditions and internal unrest.</p>
<h3>China and the United States Conduct Cotton Loan Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] In addition to ongoing negotiations for a large loan, China and the United States are also engaged in cotton loan negotiations. Two deals have been concluded, one for US$30 million and one for US$50 million, and the goods have been shipped to China separately. Another cotton loan negotiation with a larger amount is being negotiated by the National Bank of China and Citibank, and an agreement is expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Recommends National Government Revise Election Laws</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] The plenary session of the Supervisory Committee held a symposium at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th to discuss relevant election laws for the Supervisory Committee and submitted recommendations requesting the National Government to revise them. The recommendations are roughly two points: (A) Regarding the establishment of election supervisors, the members of the Supervisory Committee believe that using administrative heads as supervisors for the Supervisory Committee election is extremely susceptible to manipulation. The members elected from this may not be able to exercise their powers fairly, which violates the essence of the Constitution. Moreover, the Supervisory Committee election belongs to the provincial and municipal councils, and the affairs are extremely simple. The councils themselves are sufficient to handle it, and there is no need to establish special supervisors. (B) Regarding the restriction on rapid nomination, the members of the Supervisory Committee believe that the regulations in the Implementation Rules of the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law, which limit the nomination of provincial and municipal senators to once, make it difficult for candidates to obtain a fair opportunity and hinder the purpose of selecting the virtuous and capable. Therefore, it is proposed to amend it to not limit it to once.</p>
<h3>Tai Chuan-hsien Sends Letter to Central Authorities to Resign as Candidate for National Assembly</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Tai Chuan-hsien, President of the Examination Yuan, has recently sent another letter to Secretary-General Wu Tieh-cheng, etc., submitting it to the central authorities, requesting to resign as a candidate for the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Chairman and Madame Chiang Send Telegram to Congratulate Elizabeth on Her Wedding</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Diplomatic sources say that Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom and Lieutenant Mountbatten will hold their wedding on the 20th. Chairman Chiang and his wife sent a telegram to King George VI of England on the 19th to congratulate him. The original telegram read: "To His Majesty King George VI, on the occasion of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten, my wife and I extend our deepest congratulations to Your Majesty and the Queen, and wish the Royal Family happiness."</p>
<h3>Mr. Stryker Handles Japanese Reparation Materials to Shanghai for Investigation - We Hope that Dismantled Japanese Power Generation Equipment Will Be Used for Our Use</h3>
<p>[Our report] Mr. Stryker, entrusted by the US Department of the Army to investigate the Japanese reparations issue, arrived in Shanghai on a US military special plane from Korea at 6:40 p.m. the night before. After arriving, he was received by the US military headquarters here, and few outsiders knew about it. The Shanghai Office of the Representative Group in Japan received a telegram from the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce, and this morning Zhuang Yuling, accompanied by Zhou Maobai, director of the Chinese Shipyard, and Shi Hongxi, electrical engineer expert of the National Resources Commission, visited Mr. Stryker at the International Hotel for a quarter of an hour. Zhou and Hong told Mr. Stryker that major cities in China, including Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou, are experiencing severe power shortages. Currently, if orders are placed with Europe and the United States, it may take two to three years to deliver and build the plant. The performance of Japanese power generation equipment is just right for our country's needs. It is hoped that one or two plants will be moved to China to solve the power panic, especially for increasing the power supply to the coal mining areas to increase their production. (Continued on page two, column one)</p>
<h3>Our Ships Lost During the War Have Been Requested to be Compensated by the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Our government has recently requested compensation from the Japanese side for the loss of 321 ships totaling 530,505 tons and 300,000 tons of shipbuilding equipment during the war. According to our pre-war statistics, there were 3,457 steamships totaling 576,000 tons. During the war, 2,790 river steamers totaling 99,247 tons and 47 ocean liners totaling 250,271 tons were bombed and captured, totaling 2,837 vessels aggregating 349,518 tons. As of now, six ships have been recovered through negotiation, and the rest are still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Three Parties Have Not Reached Agreement on the Number of Legislative Yuan Candidates - The List of Supervisory Committee Candidates of the Democratic Socialist Party Has Been Decided</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] The list of Legislative Yuan candidates of the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet been submitted. They are now insisting on the same number of candidates as the Youth Party. Therefore, the prepared list currently remains at 120 names. According to Chiang Yun-tien of the party, the desire to insist on this number is to maintain the role of one-third veto power in the Legislative Yuan in the future, because the total number of Legislative Yuan members is 773, and the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties can obtain 240 seats, which is exactly one-third of the total.</p>
<p>Yu Chia-chu told reporters that the Youth Party has consistently followed a consistent policy for the general election. Therefore, the submission of various candidate lists has been extremely smooth. As for the fact that the Legislative Yuan list has not been submitted so far, it is because the Kuomintang has not yet agreed and responded to these 120 names.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Kuomintang is currently planning to use the proportion of incumbent Democratic Socialist and Youth Party members in the current Legislative Yuan as the proportion of the elected Legislative Yuan members in the next term. According to the current members of the Legislative Yuan, the sum of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties accounts for one-sixth of the total.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Regarding the issue of the Kuomintang incumbents running for the Legislative Yuan, relevant parties had discussed it a few days ago and decided to nominate them. However, if there are two incumbents in one county and the population is over one million, they can be nominated at the same time. But if there are more than three Legislative Yuan members, Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan, will decide.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Democratic Socialist Party convened a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon to review the list of Supervisory Committee candidates. After the review, it was handed over to Hsu Fu-lin to take to Nanjing last night.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] The Youth Party submitted a list of 31 Supervisory Committee candidates. As well as a principle of one province and one city.</p>
<h3>Fire at Pingyanqing Building, Election Site Destroyed</h3>
<p>The Files Are Safe, and the General Election Will Proceed as Usual</p>
<p>[Our Beijing Office, 19th] On the eve of the Beijing general election, the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan election offices were suddenly destroyed by fire. Fortunately, the important files were all transported out of danger, and the Beijing National Assembly election on the 21st can still proceed as usual. The Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau is located in Zhongnanhai, and its Household Affairs Section and the temporarily established National Assembly and Legislative Yuan election offices are located in the Yanqing Building behind Huai Ren Hall. Today, the bureau originally scheduled to host a press conference at 3:00 p.m. to report on the preparations for the National Assembly election. Unexpectedly, at 3:10 p.m., the electric wires in the gap between the second-floor floor of the west building of Yanqing Building and the ceiling downstairs suddenly caught fire. The fire brigade arrived ten minutes after the fire started, but because the building was entirely wooden and the wind was strong and the water source was insufficient, although they tried their best to put out the fire, the fire was still raging and could not be contained. The east-west corridors of the building and the Fuchang Hall were burned out. Dozens of ballot boxes prepared by the election office for the National Assembly were destroyed by fire. Fortunately, the important files of the National Assembly election were rescued at risk, so it did not affect the 1.6 million household registration cards in Beijing on the 21st, which were all buried in the fire. By 5:00 p.m., the fire had been extinguished, but at the time of publication, the embers were still burning. Huai Ren Hall, which used to host foreign guests during the era of the former Beijing government, was adjacent to the scene and was fortunately not affected by the efforts to block the fire. Mayor He Siyuan personally visited the fire scene.</p>
<h3>Details of the Sino-US Air Transport Agreement Still Need to Be Revised</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Since the signing of the Sino-US Air Transport Agreement, there have been difficulties in implementing some of the details. Our diplomatic authorities have asked the United States to send personnel to China to discuss revisions.</p>
<h3>Financial Agreement and Customs Plan - China and Hong Kong Are Conducting Negotiations - Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao Answers Reporters' Questions</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] China and Hong Kong are currently conducting negotiations on two agreements, one is the China-Hong Kong Financial Agreement, and the other is the China-Hong Kong Customs Cooperation Plan, both of which are aimed at various illegal incidents such as smuggling and the black market. This was the answer given by Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao at a press conference at 3:30 p.m. on the 19th in response to reporters' questions. Yeh said: Before we announced the new import and export regulations, China and Hong Kong maintained regular contact. Since the announcement of the new foreign exchange policy on August 16, the British government has imposed controls on the pound sterling group, which has affected and stalled the financial agreement. It is now known that the British side believes that the principles are acceptable, but the technical aspects still need to be considered. Secondly, in terms of customs, we have made a proposal, but we have not yet received a counter-proposal from the British side. The British Ambassador had previously stated that he hoped that the British Foreign Office would make a counter-proposal. Yeh also said: Yu Mou of our Ministry of Finance and Luo Jishi of the Central Bank have gone to Hong Kong, but I do not know whether this is related to this matter. Secondly, Yeh replied to the question of the government's handling of Korean residents in China, saying: "Those who want to return to their country will be assisted in returning to their country, otherwise, those who stay in our country will also be given appropriate relief."</p>
<h3>Australian Chamber of Commerce President Publishes Report on Sino-Australian Mutual Tariff Reductions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Sydney, 19th] Australian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Pollard recently published a report on the Geneva Tariff Agreement, which stated: "China has expressed its willingness to reduce tariffs on butter, cheese, milk, grain, sandalwood, and sandalwood powder by 2% to 5%. China's current tariff on brandy has been reduced by 10%. China is also willing to limit the current tariffs on wool, wheat, flour, fats, canned food, railway sleepers, paving stones, raisins, and leather to between 5% and 20%. As a reciprocal gesture, Australia has expressed its willingness to reduce tariffs on all commodities that played an important role in Sino-Australian trade before the war. If this is the case, the main commodities that will be affected are tung oil, bristles, and raw silk, etc. In addition, it has also directly expressed its willingness to make tariff concessions on the following items, namely, dried egg white, dried egg yolk, raw eggs, oil seeds, oil cakes, hair, etc., and rabbit skins, straw hat braids, antimony, firecrackers, etc." The report also stated: "Due to the special nature of China's major export goods to Australia, it is currently difficult to promote China's exports to Australia by appropriately reducing tariffs. However, Sino-Australian trade can achieve mutually beneficial development after the situation in China is relatively normal, so that both countries can benefit."</p>
<h3>Siamese Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Wang - We Pay Attention to the Development of the Siamese Political Situation</h3>

<h3>The Saying That the Northwest Joint Defense Conference Was Held Is Not Exaggerated</h3>
<p>[Our Lanzhou Office, 19th] The news that the Northwest Joint Defense and Suppression Conference was held in Nanjing has not been received by any telegrams here. The Qinghai Provincial Government Office in Lanzhou has also not received any news of Chairman Ma Bufang's arrival in Lanzhou. According to authoritative sources, it seems that there is no need to convene a Northwest Joint Defense and Suppression Conference, because the military power in the Northwest is very unified, and most of the generals are commanding the suppression of bandits on the front line, so they will not be able to spare themselves.</p>
<h3>National Army That Defended Shouguang Is Requested to Be Commended</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Office, 18th] After the siege of Shouguang County was lifted on the morning of the 18th, the remaining bandits retreated to the northwest. The National Army's army and air force coordinated to pursue and suppress the bandits, killing many bandits. In addition to awarding thousands of yuan, the Shandong authorities also telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense requesting commendations.</p>
<h3>Underground Organizations of Bandits Discovered Near Lingbao and Xia County</h3>
<p>More Than Five Hundred Staff Members Arrested</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th] More than 600 underground workers and party and government workers of the bandits, lurking near Lingbao and Xia County, disguised as merchants, smuggled a large number of weapons and ammunition, and attempted to riot. They were captured by Li Zikui, the captain of our Self-Defense Force, leading armed civilians. More than 500 of the underground workers and party and government workers of the lurking bandits were captured, and more than 5,000 long and short guns were seized. Captain Li of our Self-Defense Force is currently leading the people to cooperate with the National Army to conduct a thorough search for the escaped bandits.</p>
<h3>Chiang Praises Ningxia Corps for Aiding Yulin in Special Telegram</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 18th] The Ningxia Corps, which aided Yulin, has inflicted heavy damage on the bandits in recent days. Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram to Generals Ma Hongkui and Ma Jiajing and all the officers and soldiers to commend them. The telegram said: "This unit's full support for Yulin not only demonstrates foresight in considering the overall situation, but also fully demonstrates the noble spirit and morality of our soldiers, which is extremely commendable" and "The unit's aid to Yulin acted swiftly, repelled the bandit army, and the officers and soldiers used their lives, creating a good situation, which is deeply gratifying." [Our Nanjing Office, 19th] After suffering a severe blow from the bandits who attacked Yulin, the remnants regrouped in the southeast area to make a final stand. The National Army is now taking advantage of the victory to step up the suppression.</p>
<h3>After the Beining Road Is Opened, the People of Shenyang Are Reassured</h3>
<p>Prices Fall, Especially Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 19th] Due to the phased opening of the Beining Road and the lifting of the martial law in Shenyang, the people here are reassured and prices have fallen, especially cloth and incense paper. The Pingjin and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus are currently discussing direct through-train methods. The only difficulty is the time problem, because the Xingfu Valley section outside the customs is being rebuilt, and the train is delayed. It can be connected directly after a solution is found. The bandit eighth and ninth columns in the area west of Jinzhou have not yet moved far away, posing a great threat to transportation.</p>
<p>[Our Taoyang Office, 19th] The Jichang area is calm. All the bridges on the Jichang Railway between Hadawan and Jiuzhan were destroyed. The large and small bridges and communications from Huangqitun to Kouqian in Jinan were also completely destroyed. The rails from Jiangmifeng to Huangshanzuizi in Jidong were taken away by bandits. The bandit trains between Tiangang and Jiaohe run twice a day.</p>
<h3>Northeast Commander-in-Chief Holds Military Review Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 19th] The Commander-in-Chief held a military review meeting after the bandits' sixth offensive, starting at 4:00 p.m. on the 19th. Many senior generals participated.</p>
<h3>Jin Traitor Feng Sizu's High Court's Revised Sentence Is Criticized</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Office, 19th] After the Jin High Court revised the sentence of Feng Sizu, a traitor, to 15 years of fixed-term imprisonment, the sentence was too light, and public opinion was in an uproar. Prosecutor Liu Zihan said that Feng had deployed tens of thousands of youth in the enemy's service and collected a large amount of grain and noodles for the enemy's use, benefiting the enemy and harming the country. He had no fault to offer, and has applied to the Supreme Court for a retrial.</p>
<h3>Northern Sichuan Repairs Roads</h3>
<p>[Our Chongqing Office, 19th] As military progress is made, Zhou Yanshi, deputy director of the Construction Bureau, is inspecting the repaired Northern Sichuan Road. He told our reporter upon his return: "The Hanyu Road passes through Linshui, Dazhu, Daxian, and Wanyuan, and is 417 kilometers long. It is not suitable for military use and has been submitted to the Ministry of Communications for rapid allocation of funds for repair."</p>
<h3>Rumors That Fu Zuoyi Returned to Zhangjiakou from Beijing, Sun Lianzhong Flew to Baoding to Oversee - A Certain Unit Was Internally Transferred from Outside the Customs to Strengthen Hebei's Military Strength</h3>
<p>[Our Beijing Office, 19th] It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi left Beijing by special train at 11:30 a.m. on the 19th to return to Zhangjiakou. Fu Tongri conferred with Li Zongren and Sun Lianzhong in Beijing on the North China military affairs and has achieved results. A powerful unit of the National Army can be transferred back to Hebei. Sun Lianzhong flew to Baoding this afternoon at 2:00 p.m. with Deputy Director Song Kentang and Army Commander Gao Zhuodong to oversee the situation. Sun has been in contact with all parties in recent days and has hosted banquets for members of the Hebei Temporary Advisory Council. Various groups in Hebei hope that the Hebei authorities will ensure Baoding.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Military sources: The strength of the National Army in Hebei will be strengthened. A certain unit that has been on a long expedition outside the customs has decided to move to Hebei. According to military authorities, the tension in the Xushui Caohe area between Beijing and Baoding is not accurate. Most of the bandits attacking Shijiazhuang are reorganizing to the east and west of Shijiazhuang. Another source: About 20,000 bandits were found between Nanbeijianhe in the Cangxian North section of the Jinpu North Line.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beijing, 19th] It is reported that Yuanshi is still in the hands of the National Army. A unit of the National Army broke out of Shijiazhuang and entered Yuanshi. Currently, the Communist bandits are only making tentative attacks on the periphery of Yuanshi.</p>
<h3>UNRRA's Work in China Includes Rehabilitation of Fisheries, Agricultural Modernization, etc., to Be Continued by the Board of Directors of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] UNRRA announced a plan today, saying: The UNRRA work plan in China will be continued by the board of directors directly under the newly established Relief and Rehabilitation Commission in China.

The gains and losses of Hsuchow are related to the livelihood of over 50 million people. Without the complete suppression of bandits south of the Yellow River, Hsuchow will have no peace. The defense fortifications are expected to be completed in ten winters. The people should recognize the long-term nature of bandit suppression, and local self-defense forces should be universally strengthened to protect their homes.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 19th] The Chen Geng bandit forces that invaded Fangcheng, Chenping, and other places in western Honan have suffered a major blow. Over ten thousand bandits were forced to retreat, and the National Army and local militia completely annihilated them in the vicinity of Chenping. As of noon on the 19th, casualties exceeded 5,000. The remaining bandits scattered and fled. Local civilians have unanimously risen up, joining forces with strong militia groups to encircle the scattered bandits in sections. The Wan district has long been known for its local autonomy and self-defense. The Chen Geng bandit forces have followed the same path to destruction as the Li Hsien-nien bandit forces last year. The day of their complete annihilation is not far off.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Still Worrying Korean Problem</h3>
<p>Since the Korean question was placed on the agenda of the Second Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the American proposal has held the upper hand. The General Assembly's passage of the resolution on the 15th to establish a United Nations Temporary Commission to supervise the completion of Korean independence was a revision of the American proposal. This commission includes eight member states, and excluding the Ukraine, which refused to participate, will consist of China, India, Syria, Australia, Canada, France, the Philippines, and El Salvador as members. It also stipulates the procedures for Korean independence: 1. Elections to be held no later than March 31, 1948; 2. A National Assembly to be convened as soon as possible after the elections to form a unified government; 3. The government to form its own national army and disband all military units not belonging to the national army; 4. To liaise with the American and Soviet occupation authorities so that the withdrawal of American and Soviet troops can be completed as far as possible within ninety days after the establishment of the government. Based on this decision, the fate of Korea can be considered to have a general outline. The American authorities in Seoul said: After the passage of the UN resolution, the US-Soviet Joint Commission and the Moscow Agreement have come to an end. The Soviet authorities in North Korea said: The UN resolution is illegal and will refuse to allow the UN supervisory group to exercise its functions in Korea. Neutral observers said: Due to the Soviet Union's insistence on its own views, South Korea may form its own country; North Korea, if not annexed by the Soviet Union, will also depend on the Soviet Union for survival. Looking at the trend, the Korean problem still has potential internal and external troubles in the future, and the situation before March next year is still unpredictable.</p>
<p>The Korean problem is one of the disputes that arose after the war, and it is also one of the battlegrounds for strong countries. Why are powerful countries competing for Korea? Geographical factors are naturally greater than economic factors. Korea is a peninsula protruding from the southeast of the Asian continent, like a giant arm extending into the ocean. It was once considered a "land bridge" connecting Japan and borders Korea and Northeast China, located between China, the Soviet Union, and Japan. It has good naval and air force bases. From the perspective of the American military position, if it controls Korea, the positions of Japan and Korea are like "the spokes of a wheel depend on each other"; from the perspective of the Soviet military position, if it controls Korea, the positions of Manchuria and Korea are like "lips and teeth depending on each other". The expansion policies of powerful countries are based on geopolitics, and geopolitics determines the importance of Korea's political position. Powerful countries naturally cannot let go of Korea, and thus Korea's tragedy began. The reason why there is a problem with Korea after the war, to be honest, is that the Cairo, Potsdam, Yalta, and subsequent Moscow conferences and secret diplomacy created a big mistake. The Cairo Conference made a strong guarantee for Korean independence, but this independent freedom was limited by a "considerable period of time". Because Korean independence still needed a "considerable period of time", the Potsdam Conference decided to use the 38th parallel as the boundary, with the United States and the Soviet Union occupying the north and south respectively; therefore, at the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Roosevelt accepted the Soviet Union's demand to restore all the rights looted during the Tsarist Russian era, harming the integrity and survival of Korea; therefore, the Moscow Agreement in December 1945 decided on a five-year trusteeship plan for Korea and established a US-Soviet Joint Commission to supervise Korea. This series of mistakes caused subsequent disputes between powerful countries, turning the independence and freedom that the Korean people had longed for for many years into an unbelievable tragedy.</p>
<p>The Korean people are originally an amiable and kind nation; in the past, in order to oppose Japanese rule, there was no distinction between north and south, and no distinction between parties, everyone was united as a nation. Since Japan's surrender, new Korean parties have been established one after another, and under the divided occupation of the American and Soviet armies, two major forces have formed, with strict barriers and sharp opposition. Especially in North Korea, the training of a large number of troops is constantly accumulating and threatening a red coup at any time. Therefore, South Korea does not hesitate to adopt economic blockades, cut off cargo sources, and do not communicate with each other. Internal ideological opposition and economic opposition are becoming increasingly serious, and the Korean people have not been able to rise up and do something, which is really a great tragedy for the nation. At this UN conference, the Soviet Union advocated withdrawing troops and then holding elections, while the United States deeply feared that a red coup would occur after the withdrawal of troops, making Korea an Asian Hungary. Therefore, the United States proposed to first establish a democratically elected government, and then withdraw its troops after the national army disbanded its armed forces; the Soviet Union said that elections under the occupation of foreign troops seemed unfair. The Soviet Union and the United States fought each other, and both had their reasons; as a result of not yielding to each other, the American proposal prevailed. However, the Soviet bloc was defeated by a minority, which does not mean that the Soviet Union has made concessions on the Korean issue; in fact, the Soviet Union will be more active in Korea, and it is still the Koreans who are suffering.</p>
<p>The establishment of the UN plan is a spiritual victory for the United States. The American military announced that the US-Soviet Joint Commission and the Moscow Agreement have come to an end, which shows that the United States will take practical and effective actions to destroy the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945. Legally, the UN plan replaces the five-year trusteeship plan, and the United Nations Temporary Commission replaces the US-Soviet Joint Commission. From the perspective of Korea's future independence, the cancellation of the five-year trusteeship decision is beneficial to Korea; the United Nations Committee is easier to accept the will of the Korean people than the US-Soviet Joint Commission. Therefore, this plan is naturally more reasonable than the Moscow Agreement, and it is produced through the public will of the United Nations, which is more legitimate than the secret diplomatic approach. What is regrettable is that the establishment of this plan has not been coordinated and understood by the United States and the Soviet Union, especially the non-cooperative attitude of the Soviet bloc, which claims that the minority cannot obey the majority, will inevitably increase many difficulties for the Joint Committee. Looking at the news from Moscow in recent days, the actions of North Korea and the new crisis in Korea are growing, and the separation of north and south is difficult to avoid. Before March next year, whether North and South Korea can coordinate and rise up to unite and strive for national self-determination is a major key to the future of Korean independence and unification.</p>

<h3>Archbishop Yu Pin's Remarks</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) He stated, "I am a private citizen, but I am the editor of six newspapers and the owner of two radio stations, so I know a thing or two about public opinion. Today in China, we have a very difficult situation. Our war is not one of propaganda or writing, but a large-scale armed conflict. China currently has 20,000 fully armed communists. We fought against Japanese imperialism for ten years, so our economic situation is extremely poor. Today, China is not only fighting against the communists, but also struggling against a difficult economy." He called President Truman's message to Congress on Monday "very exciting."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 18th] Archbishop Yu Pin told reporters on the 18th that China needs economic assistance to curb inflation, which is what the United States means by providing financial aid to China. When asked by reporters how much financial aid China needs, he said he did not know. He also said that he is not an official of the Chinese government and has no right to discuss economic aid to China with President Truman, but he would like to meet with the President again because he had previously had his first meeting with the President in San Francisco.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Dismissal of Charges in the Case of Kuo Shun and Others Published</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Soochow, 19th] The case of Kuo Shun, General Manager of the Shanghai Wing On Textile Company, and managers Kuo Lin-shuang, Kuo Ti-huo, Wen Tuan-chiu, etc., being accused of being traitors was dismissed by the Soochow High Procuratorate yesterday. The reasons are now published as follows: Even if the defendants in this case are guilty of the fourth clause of the first item of Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, as alleged by the plaintiff, and referring to the order of the Judicial Yuan, the plaintiff is not a direct victim, and his report was made after the end of 1946, so it can be waived. Moreover, according to the defendants' defense, although they participated in the Japanese Yufeng Co., Ltd., it was an act of unavoidable resistance under violence, and they did not contribute funds to the enemy. After the victory, the Kiangsu-Chekiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau investigated and found that there was no act of providing funds to the enemy, so the machinery and equipment of the two factories were returned. Moreover, it was found that the defendant Kuo Shun had assisted military intelligence personnel during the war and had made meritorious contributions. The Ministry of Justice had transferred it to the Chairman's handwritten order for protection. In summary, the defendant is clearly not guilty of treason and should be dismissed.</p>

<h3>Marshall clarifies US foreign policy, seeking to restore European prosperity, transform Germany, and prevent the resurgence of aggression</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chicago, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech to the Foreign Relations Association here today, accusing the Soviet Union of engaging in the most shameless and insulting propaganda. He said that the time has come to stop such provocative actions. Marshall will leave for London in two days to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. His speech can reveal his attitude at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He said, "I will participate in this meeting with an open mind and will do my best to find a perfect foundation for agreement. No matter how provocative it is, I will avoid making statements that only serve propaganda purposes. In the entire issue of rebuilding European stability, the German issue is the most acute, but we must be prudent so that the rebuilt Germany will not threaten the European economy again. There is no doubt that Germany must be completely disarmed and demilitarized, but the US proposal to conclude a four-power 40-year treaty to monitor Germany's non-aggression still exists. In addition, we must also ensure that future German governments do not use Germany's economic power as a weapon to promote purely German policies. The answer to this question is primarily related to the future mission of the Ruhr region. The United States believes that guarantees must be established to ensure that the resources and industrial power of the Ruhr region are not controlled solely by any future German government, but can be used to promote the welfare of the entire Europe. After establishing appropriate guarantees, a temporary central authority can be established in a federal Germany, and finally the provisions of the peace treaty can be drafted. We will seek progress along these lines at the London Conference." Marshall then talked about the diplomatic issues facing the United States, saying, "The United States is a part of European civilization. The United States and the United Kingdom are sincerely striving for the recovery of Europe. Unfortunately, one of the three major powers that made significant contributions in the World War is not sharing this task with us. Its motives are still unclear, but its actions are prolonging the current state of dissatisfaction indefinitely. The differences of opinion between the United States and the Soviet Union mostly stem from this, that is, the different goals held for the future of Europe, not due to direct conflicts of interest between the two countries. We believe that to make Europe strong again, this issue must be resolved first, and then the disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union in the European part will inevitably be reduced."</p>
<h3>Soviet Union deliberately distorts propaganda, hoping to stop it in time</h3>
<p>Marshall continued to talk about the motives of US foreign policy and foreign aid programs, accusing Soviet officials and Communist parties in various places of intensifying the movement and distorting the US foreign policy intentions. He said, "These people who are obstructing the revival accuse the United States of having imperialist goals, aggressive intentions, and even wanting to provoke a third world war. I want to solemnly declare that these accusations have no truth whatsoever. We have not annexed land, and although we have the most powerful military and military resources, we have not used them to seize political or economic privileges. Since the end of the war, the United States and the United Kingdom have automatically reduced their sovereign areas in various parts of the world and given dependent nations independence and a position in the United Nations."</p>
<p>Marshall continued, "Although there are still undetermined factors in the huge and complex Marshall Plan for European aid, we deeply understand that the danger of not taking risks to try to revive Europe and taking active action is even greater. As for the Marshall Plan, it is by no means, as rumored, to sell US surplus goods to prevent a US economic panic. This peculiar accusation is extremely harsh to the European people who are eager for necessities of life and the American people who hold money waiting to buy goods imported to Europe. This is the atmosphere of propaganda. I hope that the problems caused by propaganda between the United States and the Soviet Union can be cleared up before the Foreign Ministers' Conference is held. At the beginning of the end of the war, the American people had a very high admiration for the Soviet people, the army, and their leaders, but now this attitude has completely changed. Many provocative actions by the Soviet government have not had any other obvious goals. I have tried to find explanations in the historical nature of the Soviet government, but I still don't understand why the Soviet government deliberately aroused hatred in other parties. The American people have been patient for a long time, but now they have reached the point where they cannot bear it any longer and are forced into a state of active indignation. I sincerely hope that the Soviet Union can stop these provocative measures." Marshall finally said, "I am not pessimistic about the progress in this session of the General Assembly. Although the United Nations organization has undergone severe struggles, I believe that its strength has not been seriously lost."</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Union have not reached an agreement on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 18th] When the Foreign Ministers' Conference meets on the 25th of this month, the foreign ministers' representatives will submit two agendas, one proposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and one proposed by the Soviet Union. The content and order of the former are as follows: 1. Austrian Treaty; 2. German Economic Principles; 3. German Political Organization; 4. Four-Power Treaty for Monitoring German Disarmament; 5. German Borders; 6. Procedures for Preparing a Treaty with Germany. The Soviet representative Smirnov stated that the four representatives only need to report to the Foreign Ministers' Conference that they have agreed to discuss the aforementioned items 1, 2, 3, and 6, but this does not mean that these items must be adopted.</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Foreign Ministers may discuss the procedures for the Japanese Peace Conference outside the meeting, and will formally discuss the veto issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 18th] Authoritative sources told United Press today that the United States hopes to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the procedures for holding the Japanese Peace Conference at the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, due to China's non-participation in the Foreign Ministers' Conference, this issue cannot be included in the agenda, but it is reported that Secretary of State Marshall will hold formal talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to strongly urge the Soviet Union to abandon the veto power over the resolutions of the Peace Conference. However, well-informed observers believe that this is impossible to achieve. It is reported that US officials are not particularly pessimistic. The US view on this issue is said to be based on the following factors:</p>
<p>The United Nations is unwilling to see the Soviet Union boycott the passage of the Balkan Investigation Country, the Small General Assembly, and the Korean Investigation Team. The past is a lesson. If the United States issues invitations to convene a Peace Conference without the Soviet Union's consent to participate, it will no longer be a groundbreaking move. The Soviet Union is already facing this situation. The United States considers China as obviously showing signs of agreeing with Wu Guo's position. It is believed that the Soviet Union cannot not attend the Peace Conference forever. If the United States issues invitations directly in China several times later, the Soviet Union will finally be asked to accept them. In this regard, the United States trusts the unwavering support of the United Kingdom. The United States was initially hesitant about this move, fearing that the Soviet Union would boycott the meeting and break up, but according to recent developments, the United States believes that this matter is only a small matter in the general split between Washington and Moscow. In any case, the invitations to the Japanese Peace Conference will not be issued before Marshall and Molotov's successes or failures at the London Conference.</p>
<h3>Stevenson supports the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Orleans, 18th] Republican presidential candidate Stevenson delivered a speech at the Foreign Affairs Society here tonight, saying that he fully supports the Marshall Plan.</p>
<h3>Princess Elizabeth's wedding today, people wait overnight to see the grand ceremony</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] Today is the eve of the wedding of Crown Princess Elizabeth, and the city is covered in dark clouds and rain. The princess rose at dawn and was busy preparing. According to unofficial sources, the bridegroom, Captain Mountbatten, is expected to be granted the title of Duke of Clarence or Duke of Edinburgh by the King. At the same time, experienced police officers from the police station have completed the security network, and the same measures have been taken from Buckingham Palace to Waterloo Station, the starting point of the honeymoon trip, and the Guangdi Building near Yuen Mengxi, Hampshire, the end point. Thousands of citizens began to gather in the streets tonight, preempting the foremost position behind the police officers and patiently waiting for the passing of the ceremonial guard tomorrow. In a few private buildings near the government agencies, there were even people buying "window rights" to compete for the appearance of the new couple.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 19th] The wedding dress worn by Princess Elizabeth was made of white silk with a veil of fifteen feet long. The embroidery on the dress was meticulously completed by 300 female workers in two weeks. When they worked, they wore cotton paper sleeves and had to wash their hands every half an hour to avoid staining the dress. Because the bridegroom is very tall, the princess will wear higher heels than usual. After the wedding, her gifts will be stored in the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p>
<h3>Amidst the surging national strike in France, Blum tries to form a new cabinet, the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party officially announces</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 19th] The Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mollet, announced at a luncheon of the Anglo-American Press Association today that, due to the surging strike instigated by the Communist Party, former Prime Minister Blum has agreed to try to form a new cabinet and will be completed in the next few days. France is currently divided into two factions. If a civil war breaks out, the situation will be as bad as in Spain. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate forces to resist the Communist Party and de Gaulle's People's Renaissance Party. The Blum Cabinet is the last chance for France to retain freedom, peace, and democratic elements and negotiate with the United States.</p>
<h3>The Northern Legislative Council drafts a provisional constitution with implied hostility to the South Korean government</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The North Korean People's Assembly, a legislative body formed by the North Korean People's Government to confront the South Korean government, continued to hold meetings today, chaired by Speaker Kim Doo-bong, to discuss the speaker's report on the drafting of a provisional constitution. Representative Kim Jeong-ju said in his speech that the fact that the Korean Provisional Constitution does not use the word "North" is of great significance. This is a declaration of war on the "reactionary elements" in South Korea, which will sweep away the reactionary style of the South Korean transitional legislative assembly. In the afternoon meeting, it was decided to draft the Korean Provisional Constitution and elect the members of the Constitution Drafting Committee. Kim Doo-bong was elected as the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and Kim Il-sung Mang Ji-ju Choi Kyung-deok and 31 others were elected as members. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The North Korean legislative body was established on the 18th. 230 people's representatives from each province participated in the ceremony. Eleven people from the local area and the Standing Committee of the People's Committee also attended the meeting.</p>
<h3>China supports US proposal on veto issue</h3>
<p>Wei Jun refutes Soviet group's slander</p>
<p>[Our report] New York Broadcasting on the 19th: Success Lake News, the UN Political Committee met today to discuss the veto issue. Chinese representative Gu Weijun delivered a speech, supporting the US position and agreeing to submit the issue to the "Small General Assembly" for discussion. He refuted the statement by Ukrainian representative Manuilsky that China is the incarnation of the United States. He said that China's votes on any issue are based on a fair position as the standard of judgment, and the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are not enough to influence our attitude. The situation is obviously different in Ukraine. If one country in the Yugoslav group votes in one way, the other countries in the group will inevitably follow suit. Although this is Ukraine's business and has nothing to do with us, it is clearly wrong for Ukraine to accuse China of relying on the opinions of other countries. Gu reiterated his support for the US proposal, and strongly stated that the use of the veto power has shattered the hopes of the world.</p>
<h3>President Truman plans to send another message to Congress</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 18th] White House Press Secretary Ross told reporters that President Truman will issue a long-term revival message to Congress on European aid within the next week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Republican Senator Taft, chairman of the Economic Committee of both houses of Congress, announced today that the two items of loan sales and export control proposed by President Truman are expected to be passed by the special meeting of the Zero Society, but the Republican Party will firmly oppose the President's request for authorization to control prices, wages, and consumer goods rationing. These controls are "a further move towards a completely totalitarian country." At the same time, AFL-CIO Chairman Green delivered a radio speech last night, saying that the labor community will unanimously oppose price and wage controls unless they are used as a last resort during a national emergency.</p>
<h3>US Navy successfully tests defense against atomic bomb radiation</h3>

<h3>The situation in Siam is unclear, the United Kingdom and the United States will recognize the new government later, Swiss police are closely protecting the young king</h3>
<p>[United Press, Success Lake, 18th] People well-informed in the United Kingdom and the United States told United Press today that the United Kingdom and the United States will not recognize the new government of Siam until Luang Phibuns leaves the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army. At the same time, authoritative sources revealed that Prince Swatievat, acting head of the Siamese delegation to the United Nations, has telegraphed Bangkok to urge the new government of Apaiwong and the exiled government of Prime Minister Phraya Phahon to negotiate and reconcile.</p>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 18th] Former Prime Minister Phraya Phahon and Secretary Xue Texivi were reportedly detained in the naval prison tonight. A military spokesman said yesterday that seven suspects have been arrested in connection with the assassination of the late King Mahidol, and one other is at large. Xue Texivi is one of the people at large. The military also stated that the conspiracy to assassinate the late king was intended to change the monarchy to a republic, but no concrete evidence has been presented yet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Zurich, 18th] King Bhumibol of Thailand is currently studying in Switzerland and lives in a villa on the north bank of Lake Geneva.

<h3>The Literary Movement Association Announces the Meeting; Speaker Pan Delivers a Speech Explaining "The Meaning of Universal Suffrage"</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the Central Cultural Movement Committee organized "Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Campaign Rally for National Assembly Representatives." It was held yesterday from 5 PM to 8 PM at the Cultural Center, hosting cultural figures from the city, as well as district representatives and neighborhood heads from Hongkou and North Sichuan Road areas. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Chu Wenren, Deputy Director of the Association. Speaker Pan attended and delivered a speech titled "The Meaning of Universal Suffrage," stating in brief: The Republic of China has been established for thirty-six years, but the implementation of constitutional governance will begin with this year's upcoming elections for National Assembly Representatives and legislators. The Kuomintang's one-party tutelage will thus be formally declared ended, and</p>
<p>Power Returned to the People</p>
<p>The National Assembly Representatives and legislators elected by the people will be the figures who represent the people in managing state affairs in the future. Mr. Pan also said: The National Assembly Representatives have two tasks: first, to represent the people in safeguarding the Constitution, and second, to represent the people in electing the President. The method is similar to a company's shareholders electing a group of directors to control the company's major policies, and then the board of directors electing a general manager to implement the company's</p>
<p>All operations. Therefore, all members of our Kuomintang and compatriots who believe in the Three Principles of the People, if they want to protect our Three Principles of the People Constitution and promote its full benefits, should cherish their right to vote, and use conscience and reason to judge who is the ideal person who can take on this responsibility to be our representative. He continued that the current voting method is anonymous, which is an absolutely democratic and free method, but citizens should note that they cannot therefore give up voting, nor can they arbitrarily evade it, because abandoning or evading it, although not a crime in law,</p>
<p>Carries a responsibility in conscience. In other words, if all voters have the mentality of abandoning or evading voting, then what is there to talk about democracy, and how can constitutional governance be implemented? I am a member of the Kuomintang and also a candidate nominated by the Kuomintang. If you believe in the Kuomintang and think highly of me among the candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, then vote for me, but this is still your own freedom.</p>
<p>After Speaker Pan finished his speech, the film "Happiness Rhapsody" was screened to entertain the guests. It was also learned that Speaker Pan attended campaign speeches in various locations all day yesterday, totaling six places. The Tianchan Stage had invited Mr. Pan to give a speech last night, but Mr. Pan could not attend due to taking a night train to Jinan.</p>
<p>All Sectors Support Mr. Pan</p>
<p>Since Speaker Pan was nominated as a candidate for National Assembly Representative in this city, various sectors have expressed their support: The Shanghai branch of the National Chengchi University Alumni Association held an extraordinary meeting yesterday, unanimously resolving to support Instructor Pan Gongzhan as a National Assembly Representative. All members of the Shanghai Literary and Art Writers Association, with Director Pan Gongzhan's usual efforts to maintain literature and art, unanimously supported and jointly voted for him. More than twenty people, including Xu Wenzhao and others from the city's tourism industry, appealed to more than 390 class B and C businesses in the city to unanimously elect Mr. Pan Gongzhan as a National Assembly Representative for the city. Li Fangzheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Writers Association's Literary Lecture Alumni Association, said that this time Mr. Pan is a candidate for National Assembly Representative in this city, and our cultural and educational circles and students above the specialist level should unanimously vote in support.</p>

This general election is the beginning of the people's exercise of the four rights. He wished the people success in using their voting rights in this election, success in implementing constitutional governance, and success in the Three Principles of the People. Afterwards, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, hoping that citizens would vote enthusiastically. There are currently three million voters in this city. If the number of votes cast is only 400,000, it will become a joke. This matter concerns our country's national dignity. He hoped that all citizens would use their voting rights as much as possible to strive for international national dignity and seek to improve the level of democracy. Finally, Xu Jiguang, Liu Weichi, and others delivered speeches before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Investigation Report States: Seeing a Hand Signal from the Window, Xu Jizhuang's Wife and Others Were Investigated in Court Yesterday</h3>

Shortly after, Cao drove the empty car back to the address. Police bureau personnel searched the premises but could not find Xu Jizhuang. They therefore believed that Xu's wife and others had concealed a criminal and facilitated his escape, so they arrested everyone present.

The interrogation lasted from 3 PM to 8:30 PM, and the three defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Heroes Have No Place to Use Their Skills; Fine Horses Sigh with Regret. They Are Extremely Willing to Be of Service and Repay Their Master by Doing Their Best for Refugees</h3>
<p>[Special Report from our Newspaper] Ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai, it's been almost three years since we last met. Thank you for not forgetting us, and for mentioning us again at this time. When we first heard that someone had proposed "restoring horse racing" in the City Council, we thought: Heroes can finally have a place to use their skills again! We were so happy that our tails were wagging. But then they said that our racing was gambling in nature, so it was dropped as a topic, leaving us with nothing but empty joy and still unable to come out. This time, we hear that we're being brought up again for the sake of refugee relief. We hope that this time it can finally become a reality. We've been idle and doing nothing for so many years, we really feel like we're growing fat from disuse! Also, seeing those poor refugees, we're quite willing to put our four hooves to work.</p>
<h3>Past Glory, But Now Just a Case</h3>
<p>We recall the glory days before the war, and can't help but sigh. At that time, we had more than five hundred partners. How fun it was to be together, neighing and calling! Our old home was originally in Mongolia. After the master bought us, he printed the year on our backs. So as long as you look, you can know which year we came to Shanghai. But we can't just be filling space. Our height, measured from the top of the mane to the back of the front leg, has to be between twelve feet three inches and thirteen feet three inches to qualify for competition. Please don't be surprised, no horse twelve feet tall has ever been discovered in the world. What is called a foot here is not a real foot, but what is called a Hand in English, that is, the distance from the thumb to the little finger, which is equal to four inches. So, to be precise, our standard height is twelve "hands" three inches to thirteen "hands" three inches. It's just that people are used to saying feet.</p>
<h3>Training Soldiers for a Thousand Days, Using Them for One</h3>
<p>After meeting the height requirements, we can't just participate in the competition right away. We also have to put in a lot of hard work to practice. Every morning, the groom leads us to the racecourse, and the heroic jockey rides us for half an hour or an hour, running until we're sweating and our muscles are trained. On the one hand, we eat good things, we eat barley, we eat bran. The master can be said to be taking care of us in every possible way. This is nothing more than wanting to "train soldiers for a thousand days, use them for one."</p>
<p>When the race comes, there are regulations for the weight we carry on our bodies. Those of us who are thirteen "hands" tall must carry no less than one hundred and fifty-two pounds. If our jockey weighs only one hundred and fifty pounds, he has to add two pounds of lead. Those of us who are twelve "hands" three inches tall must carry no less than one hundred and forty-nine pounds, those who are thirteen "hands" one inch tall must carry no less than one hundred and fifty-five pounds, and those who are thirteen "hands" three inches tall must carry no less than one hundred and sixty-one pounds. This way, our chances are equal, and we run without hesitation. Whoever wins the championship, the master of that horse will be rewarded. This is the time for us to repay the kindness of our masters.</p>
<h3>Hoping to Return to the Racecourse One Day</h3>
<p>In addition to the races where tickets are sold, our masters sometimes hold purely competitive "paper hunting races." That's really fun. The so-called paper hunting race usually takes place in the suburbs. Someone first scatters confetti between the starting and ending points, and we follow the trail of confetti. Sometimes we need to jump over small streams, sometimes we need to cross bamboo fences, and sometimes the person scattering the paper deliberately sets up a trap, and we have to run the wrong way. I remember once we trampled on a morning field, which almost caused a conflict. In the end, our master compensated for it, and it was also recorded in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Horse races have been banned in the past two years, and our fate has been miserable. Many partners have been sold by their masters, "falling" to pulling horse carts or being ridden for fun. Fortunately, we are one of the "famous horses." Our master is reluctant to abandon us, and still rides us to the racecourse or circles around the Great West Road every morning. But even so, our food costs our master two or three million yuan a month. We're always unhappy in our hearts, and always hope that one day we can return to the racecourse and win a prize for our master, and get some glory.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, our hope for the reopening of horse racing is not entirely for ourselves. We also want to do our best for the refugees! Look, the Siberian cold current has already arrived!</p>

<h3>Imitating the Trademark of Diederichsen &amp; Co.; The Enemy Assets Clearance Office Requests Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Yan Shouheng, the owner of the Zhida Printing Factory at No. 43, Lane 546, Xinzha Road, imitated the trademark paper of Diederichsen &amp; Co., reaching more than 10,000 reams.

<h3>Strange Incident! Running Out of the House with a Knife for No Reason; Arrested and Confessed to Killing His Wife and Abandoning the Body</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Zhang Qien, 51, from Nantong, residing at No. 11 Yude Lane, Yunnan Road. Yesterday at around 10 AM, his nephew Zhang Guanqing (29 years old) came, and after a few words of conversation, Guanqing suddenly grabbed a kitchen knife and ran outside like he was insane. Qien did not understand the reason and rushed out to chase after him. At the intersection of Yunnan Road and Beihai Road, he restrained him, called the police, and brought him to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau. After interrogation, according to his confession, at around 5 AM on April 9, he stabbed his wife Zhang Xu Yinge in the chest, neck, and head with a knife in the wilderness of South Wharf, Pudong, killing her and abandoning the body by the roadside before fleeing. As for the reason for killing his wife, it was because she often didn't come home and had numerous lovers outside. The most obvious was having an affair with his younger uncle Zhang Taotao, acting like husband and wife. Taotao is now a self-employed tricycle driver serving as the assistant manager of the Siming Bank. Also, his brother-in-law Zhou Xiaoqing, who works as an employee of the bank, colluded to hide Yinge for about three months. After questioning them, he was beaten, and therefore held a deep grudge. So after finding her, he lured her to Pudong and committed this heinous act.</p>

<h3>Shaoxing Seven Counties Association: Wang Xiaolai and Others Write to the Court Regarding Zhang Chunfan's Case, Requesting Impartial Justice; Zhou Jianxing's Bail Request Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] After the District Procuratorate indicted Zhang Chunfan for the crime of instigating suicide, the District Court scheduled the trial to begin on the 27th. It is learned that the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai, represented by Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Vice-Chairman Wang Yansong, and Pei Yunqing, submitted a letter to Judge Meier, who is presiding over the Zhang case, yesterday. The letter roughly stated that the unnatural death of a generation of artists has caused a public outcry, which is understandable, but the cause of death cannot be accurately determined based on post-mortem fabrications. It is hoped that Zhang Chunfan's case will be handled impartially. Therefore, Zhou Jianxing, chairman of the Shanghai Theater Association, on behalf of the association, submitted a petition to the District Procuratorate, requesting bail for Zhang Chunfan. The District Procuratorate, considering that the Zhang case has been fully investigated and transferred to the District Court, forwarded the petition to the District Court. After Judge Mei reviewed it, he considered that the association is neither a relative of the defendant nor the defendant's legal representative, and therefore cannot apply for bail on their behalf, and the request was rejected.</p>

<h3>Director Wu Discusses Winter Relief: Confident in Fundraising</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday about the winter relief work: The location of the Sheng Sheng Pasture First Shelter has been resolved after negotiations and has already accommodated hundreds of people.

Regarding the fundraising issue, Director Wu said that he is confident. The focus of negotiations on the additional donations from the entertainment industry is on the film industry. If the film industry is resolved, there will be no problems with the others. After Mayor Wu's negotiations with the film merchants, it was decided in principle not to use the method of adding donations to ticket prices, but to select about ten good films that have not been shown before by the film merchants for charity screenings and issue joint tickets. Each ticket can watch all the films. According to Director Wu, the price of each joint ticket is planned to be 2 million yuan, which can be realized after negotiation.

<h3>Thirty-Six Gang Leaders Arrested · Son Beaten to Death, Father Asks for Justice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Pengnian, known as "Cowhide Candy," and Lu Ruizhang from Xiaowuxi, Wang Zhang and Shang, Wang Zhizhang, who are known as the thirty-six notorious gang leaders in the Suzhou Creek area, are notorious in the Suzhou Creek area. Earlier this month, they gathered a crowd at 693 South Suzhou Road and stabbed Ji Ruiqing, the owner of the Ruitai firewood shop, with a knife.

He was then beaten to death by Wang Pengnian and his gang. At that time, due to fear of their potential power, he did not dare to report the incident and has been suffering in silence ever since. After reading the newspaper and learning that Wang had been arrested, he came to report the incident and requested that the case be handled together.</p>
<h3>Single Weak Woman Meets Thugs on the Journey: Stalked from Hangzhou to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a stalking case involving a group of thugs targeting a lone young woman occurred on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Gao Meihua, a young woman from Shanghai, lived with her uncle at 44, Lane 121, North Chengdu Road. The day before yesterday, she went from Shanghai to Hangzhou to visit friends and seek a living. However, after arriving in Hangzhou, she learned that her friend had already moved elsewhere. She spent the night in a small hotel near the station, planning to return to Shanghai by train the next day. While Gao was sleeping soundly in the middle of the night, she was suddenly awakened by the sound of the ceiling board being struck and multiple people whispering. When she saw the floorboard lifting up, several pairs of thieving eyes were frequently peering at her. Gao was shocked and quickly pretended to have a stomachache, waking up the tea boy to send boiling water and taking the opportunity to get dressed. She rushed to the station, hastily leaving her mask bag in the hotel. She then saw several thugs also following and teasing her. As she was alone, she did not dare to speak out. She waited until 6:10 and took train 40 to Shanghai. At that time, one of the thugs was also on the train, following her closely. When the train arrived at the North Station yesterday afternoon, Gao quickly got off the train and went to the Chief Station Master's office to ask for protection. Her expression was quite flustered. After the station staff asked about the reason, they ordered the police to arrest the thugs, but nothing was achieved. The woman was then escorted back to her residence by the police sent by the station.</p>

<h3>Three Thousand Miles in Northern Jiangsu: The People's Voices - The People Withdraw South with the Garrison</h3>
<h3>The People Withdraw South with the Garrison</h3>
<p>Due to the adjustment of the overall strategy, the military authorities are unwilling to drag a large force for the sake of one city. On October 1st, the authorities decided to withdraw the garrison from Yancheng. At 1:00 AM in the deep night, the county government notified all the people in the city to prepare for withdrawal. Except for the elderly, weak, women, and children, everyone in the city gathered at dawn and were organized by County Magistrate Wu Wenchun to withdraw south with the garrison. Because they were unwilling to be oppressed and ravaged by the bandits, this group of more than 300,000 unfortunate people, unafraid of the attacks of hunger and cold, fled to the areas controlled by the National Army, although the government did not have a proper arrangement or relief for them.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived in Dongtai, it was the third day after the retreat from Yancheng. The reporter saw the situation where the refugees were selling the only relief items they received - clothes from the Su-Ning Sub-district Office - at a low price to raise travel expenses, which was truly heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>Cunningly Move Towards Defense Gaps</h3>
<p>Currently, there is a noteworthy problem in the hearts of the troops and the people. Now the National Army is adopting mobile warfare with the aim of defeating the main force of the bandits. In the current situation of insufficient troop allocation, we should believe and understand that a unit cannot stay for long after capturing a stronghold. In the short term, everything is normal in the local area, but the problem becomes serious after the National Army is transferred away. With the old trick of wandering bandits, they specialize in drilling into the gaps. When he discovers that the defense here is weak and there are no regular troops stationed, he will immediately concentrate his forces to sneak attack. After the capture, according to their terror policy, anyone who has done anything for the National Army or the government, or even spoken to government personnel once, will be regarded as a reactionary and killed without mercy. Although the Huaihai Pacification Zone stipulates that the self-defense forces of a district or township should send women and children to safe areas when necessary to retreat and complete the "clearing the fields," how can they take care of it when the situation is tense? Therefore, the reporter heard many people say: If the National Army wants to advance, it must stay for a long time. Otherwise, for the sake of the people, it is better not to advance. The fact is indeed the case, but how can it be done? However, it must be said that, up to now, the speaker has never heard anyone in the local area say that they do not want the National Army to advance to their hometowns. They believe that any situation under government control is tens of thousands of times better than when the bandits occupy it. Therefore, as soon as they hear that the National Army is advancing, the local people immediately begin to provide information and assist in transportation and other work.</p>
<p>Now the reporter wants to turn his pen and talk about the people who were coerced and lured into joining the bandit groups.</p>
<h3>Current Re-education Work</h3>
<p>To open a new path for some ignorant and uneducated people who have been lured or coerced into joining the bandit groups, each county has established re-education centers, which are responsible for handling the re-education work after self-renewal.</p>
<p>The methods of the Communist bandits are vicious and ruthless. In order to succeed in their "cause" and strive to win over the broad masses, they do not hesitate to use any means to drive the people and lure the people to plunge into their abyss of sin. However, everyone has a sense of right and wrong. Coercion and deception can only be effective for a while. As long as people discover their sins, they will immediately return to the embrace of the government. Of course, there are very few exceptions.</p>
<p>There is an English proverb: "East, west, home is best." I have asked too many people who are undergoing re-education, and their answers are all the same for their families and children.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the current re-education work, there is a deep contradiction. That is, the psychology of mutual hatred between the people who have not joined the bandits and the people who have joined the bandits has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, there are many people who have joined the bandits whose hearts have already begun to regret their decisions, but they do not dare to rush to the embrace of the government.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the re-education work is a mess in many places. Due to the extortion and intimidation of the village chiefs, their terror is deepened. A self-reformed person, who wants to receive the "re-education" washing, cannot buy through the village chief, you want to forget about it. Because generally people's psychology, get through the government re-education, on his own personality, there will be one more layer of protection. Even some people in general, see the family's people delivered to the county to get re-education, think as if it is going to jail, the whole family is frightened and crying. In fact, some of the counties' re-education centers are similar to prisons.</p>
<p>In the Guanyun County Re-education Center a few months ago, many tragedies were created due to insufficient "prisoner rations." Also, due to the misconduct of the person in charge, the actual number of people did not match the roster at all. Some people had "released on bail" noted under Zhang San's name, but the person who was released was not Zhang San, but Li Si. After County Magistrate Zheng Senqi took over, he inquired in detail and immediately released those with lighter offenses. Before releasing them, he also talked to them individually, telling them: Those who bailed you out are all township chiefs, they sympathize with you very much, and they hope that you will assist them more in their work after you come out. He also introduced them to the local district chiefs. This can eliminate their alienation from the township chiefs and can also eliminate their hatred for the township chiefs. This fact is enough to show that the re-education center not only cannot do the re-education work, but also cannot do it well like a prison. Among the counties I have seen, Gaoyou's re-education center is the best. Several phases have been completed, and after the re-education is completed, they are assisted in changing jobs. The self-reformed people who are undergoing re-education in Gaoyou are all very fat, which shows that their nutrition is very good. County Magistrate Zhang Guanqiu asked them: "Have you eaten your fill?" "Yes!" A burst of happy cheers.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an undeniable fact that some people who are obsessed with their delusion have been too deeply anesthetized by the bandit army and their minds can no longer be changed. Many counties have discovered that people who have undergone self-examination or re-education still secretly communicate with the bandits and specialize in providing the bandit army with intelligence. For this, the government should resolutely deal with it, so that the people can be warned that there is no me with bandits, and there are no bandits with me. Otherwise, today they are obedient people; and when they arrive in the bandit army camp, struggle, purge... and they will do everything. In this way, it is enough to create a fluke mentality among the general public. They see through the government's weakness of being lenient, and they might as well be arrested and then start a new life. Therefore, our request to the government today is: Punish the murderers according to the circumstances, and be lenient to a limited extent. (Special reporter Ling Songshou)</p>
<h3>Enemy-Left Coal Swapped for Soil - Suzhou Nanyang Hotel Manager</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 17th] Bai Futai, the manager of the Nanyang Hotel on Hengma Road outside Lanmen, was previously entrusted by the Central Trust Bureau to keep 49 tons of enemy-left coal. Bai actually swapped 39 tons of it for soil. The above coal was then sold by auction. When it was extracted, it was found to be deteriorated, so the Central Trust Bureau sent it to the Wu District Procuratorate for investigation. The case has now been concluded by the Procuratorate, and Bai Futai has been prosecuted to the Criminal Court for embezzlement.</p>
<h3>Notarized Marriage to be Implemented Soon in Changshu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changshu, 18th] This District Court has specially set up a notary office to facilitate the public in handling notary affairs. Recently, it received a petition, the content of which is a request for notarized marriage. The male protagonist is Chu Mingde, from Fugang, and the female lead is Lu Ruizhen, from Xieqiao. The above request is still a first in this county. The content of the petition is euphemistic and readable; the original is as follows: "For the sake of our affection, we wish to be husband and wife, and jointly request that the marriage be notarized, and we will comply with the instructions after approval. The petitioners live in the same village, and are also related to each other. Although we have never met before, we have known each other for a long time. After the introduction of Tan Shuliang and Feng Guoxiang, we have been in contact from time to time, and we are truly in love and have sworn an oath of love. The male is a widower, and has no wife. The female is unmarried, and is waiting to be married. We could have held a wedding with a matchmaker, but there is a hidden reason that is difficult to say. The petitioner Mingde runs a shop, and can barely support himself. Ruizhen's family has an old mother, who is instigated by others and does not allow her freedom. Therefore, relatives are silent, and neighbors are watching. It is true that the autonomy of marriage has not been implemented in the countryside, and growing old in years is deeply worrying. There is no group wedding here at this time. If we fly away to get married in another place, not only is our ability limited, but we are afraid of being mistaken for eloping. We humbly believe that notarized marriage seems to be personally ordained by law, and we have heard that it has been realized in other counties. After consultation, we jointly submit a petition for implementation. As for the amount of fees to be paid, what items to be prepared, and what procedures to be followed, we earnestly request instructions and will comply, and we are deeply grateful." It is learned that the above petition has been approved by the District Court, and the notarized marriage is scheduled to be held on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Female Thief in Fuling, Crawling on the Eaves, Shadow Fleeting</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 17th] Li Agui, a villager from Yusha Township, Xiangcheng, worked as a helper at the home of Cai Furuo, a farmer in a neighboring village. On October 21st of this year, Agui was chatting and laughing in the room of Cai Furuo's sister-in-law, Shen. Cai Furuo and his brother suspected that there was an illicit relationship and beat Agui with a bamboo shoulder pole, killing him on the spot. In shock and regret, Furuo and his brother warmed the body with a foot stove and wrapped it in a quilt the next day. They used a boat to send the body back to Li's house, falsely claiming that Agui had accidentally eaten Datura stramonium (commonly known as "drunk fairy peach") and was poisoned by alcohol. Later, Li A'wu, Agui's father, discovered the wounds. He negotiated with Furuo and his brother. As a result, the local Deputy Chief Shi Jun took the initiative to mediate a private settlement, and ordered Cai Furuo to subsidize Li A'wu with 100 stones of rice. Unexpectedly, after Cai Furuo's incident, the social expenses were huge, and the promised rice to Li A'wu had not been paid for a long time.

<h3>Woolen Cloth Sales Not Quiet to Customers</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of woolen cloth to customers in Nanjing and Hangzhou have not been quiet. Fancy woolen cloth and Suanni huada cloth have been continuously embellished. There have also been many transactions of dark blue medium-thick serge, and the demand for overcoat woolen cloth is even stronger, with black and gray colors in the price range of about 1 million yuan per yard being in even greater demand. Customers from Sichuan and Anqing also have continued orders. The rest have seen fewer purchases due to the impact of the current situation and transportation relations.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Capital Outflow, The National Bank Limits Remittances to No More Than 20 Million</h3>
<p>To prevent capital outflow, the Central Bank has stipulated that remittances in each location cannot exceed 20 million yuan per transaction. If this amount is exceeded, branches in each location must report to the head office for approval. At present, the water exchange in South China is relatively stable, between 100 and 130 yuan per 1,000 yuan for commercial banks and financial institutions.</p>

<h3>Iron Sand Transported to Japan for Barter Trade, Contract Draft Has Been Prepared</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau recently planned to transport 150,000 tons of iron sand to Japan for barter trade, and the MacArthur Headquarters indicated its willingness to accept the plan.

The price, agreed upon by both parties, is calculated at US$7 per ton, according to the evaluation by the Resources Committee and the Central Trust Bureau.</p>
<p>[Further News] The bureau transported 4,700 tons of soybeans from Shanghai and Qinhuangdao to Japan this month. These were cash transactions, so Japan needs to pay a certain amount of foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Beijing and Shantou Traders Vigorously Buy, Chinese Stocks Full of Vitality</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks surged wildly yesterday in the after-hours black market. Traders from Beijing and Shantou vigorously bought in the after-hours market. Although major firms in the industry sold after buying, shorts have started to cover and outside capital has begun to seep in. Small stocks like China United, Jingfu, and Xinguang rose rapidly.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>Market sentiment was stable. The opening prices of stocks showed only slight changes. Wing On Cotton Mill opened at 336 yuan and 333 yuan, then fell to a low of 329 yuan for immediate delivery and 320 yuan for deferred delivery. It then rebounded to 338 yuan and 339 yuan. Stock number 170 sold current Wing On Cotton Mill shares, while number 32 sold deferred Wing On Cotton Mill shares, bringing the price back down to around 334 yuan. China Cement was bid up to the daily limit. After-hours interest rates remained at 1.8 and 2.25 *jiao*. Wing On Cotton Mill was forced to remain at 332 yuan for a long time due to continuous selling.

Just before closing, after-hours bids rose sharply, the after-hours black market surged wildly, and market sentiment was boosted again, rising to a high of 342 yuan for immediate delivery and 344 yuan for deferred delivery. Then, after retail investors closed out their positions, the closing prices for both current and deferred delivery were 340 yuan.

<p>Flour mills strengthened their stomach-settling intentions, and customer sentiment turned firm, rising by 7,000-8,000 yuan. Bran sales were active in rural areas, soaring by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake factories also had firm intentions, continuing to rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Bean traders and oil mills continued to absorb soybeans, steadily rising by another 20,000-30,000 yuan. Mung beans had limited supply and demand, and the situation was stable. Red beans continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. Cowpeas continued to be sold actively, rising by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Broad beans also became popular, rising by 10,000-20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum retailers rushed to purchase, but supply could not keep up with sales, soaring by 20,000-30,000 yuan. Corn from the northern ports continued to rise in a straight line, increasing by 20,000-30,000 yuan. Sesame sales were brisk, with oil mills and local merchants competing to buy, gradually rising by 20,000-30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Black sesame became a scarce commodity, soaring by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were continuously handled by Guangdong merchants, and local merchants also participated, competing to purchase, rising straight up by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Wheat continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. The oil market had strong buying sentiment, with prices rising across the board. Raw tung oil soared by 100,000 yuan.

<h3>Rayon Opened Steady, Then Rose Sharply at Closing</h3>
<p>The rayon market was very stable yesterday morning, but rose sharply again in the afternoon, resulting in an increase of 6 million yuan compared to the previous day. Article 120, Asahi brand 1A bright, opened at 102 million yuan, once reaching a high of 5 million yuan, and then fell back to close at 3 million yuan at noon. The final asking price in the afternoon was 8 million yuan. Asahi brand 4A was asking for 95 million yuan, and Toyo Station 4A was around 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Silk</p>
<p>Due to sluggish actual sales, the market was very soft yesterday morning, but better in the afternoon. As a result, the asking price was not much different from the previous day. Grade C was traded in two lots yesterday, at 73 million yuan and 3.8 million yuan respectively. Gao Ling Zu was previously traded at 71 million yuan, and was traded at 72.5 million yuan in the afternoon. Medium grade was traded in the morning at 67 million yuan, and in the afternoon at 9 million yuan. Gan Jing was firmer yesterday, and ordinary was traded at 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>The market was expensive yesterday. Zhen Silk, quilt covers, Dachang, and Huaqiang goods were traded in the morning at 69 million yuan for immediate closing, and 70.5 million yuan for deferred delivery. Market sentiment was booming in the afternoon, and prices surged across the board, with the final price reaching as high as 84 million yuan. For other goods, factory prices have recently been insufficient to cover costs. Due to narrow actual sales, market prices have failed to keep up with raw materials. Therefore, factory prices were generally not released yesterday afternoon. Common goods such as Huajin crepe were asking for 67,000 yuan, Minsheng special grade serge was asking for 75,000 yuan, and Lin's waxed feather yarn was asking for 72,000 yuan, all of which were morning market prices.</p>
<p>(Our dispatch) The Central Trust of China has not allocated rayon for a long time. According to Deputy Director Luo, 5,000 cases of Japanese rayon will arrive in Shanghai within 32 days, and sales will resume.</p>
<h3>Stable Green Tea for Export</h3>
<p>Domestic tea sales continue to flow smoothly due to sales in local shops and merchants, so buyers still have the upper hand, and the situation is trending positively. As for the foreign merchants' tea market, there were both inflows and outflows of Keemun black tea, and the market atmosphere changed little. As for green teas such as Chunmee and Gunpowder, which are sold to Africa, since sellers have become increasingly firm in their sales intentions due to the scarcity of goods, exporters have tried to continue to suppress prices, but have ultimately failed. Therefore, transactions have been gloomy so far, but the process remains stable.</p>
<h3>China Aluminum and Steel Factory Supplies Steel-Lined Paper for Tea Packaging</h3>
<p>For tea exports, packaging is usually done using wooden boxes lined with tin foil. This tin foil is actually lead and is lined with inferior paper. It is not only unhygienic, but also easily damaged due to manual production, failing to achieve the effect of moisture resistance and lacking aesthetic appeal. The China Aluminum and Steel Factory of this city, in view of this situation, has imitated foreign tea packaging methods and created a type of steel-lined paper for tea packaging to meet demand. It is not only bright and beautiful, and only one-quarter the weight of lead, but also strong and durable, saving the cost of backing paper and reducing costs significantly.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Barter Paper Coupons Will Be Handled Uniformly by the Central Trust</h3>
<p>The Central Trust of China has entrusted the China Tobacco Company with allocating the paper coupons for barter trade with Japan to various cigarette factories, with 80% allocated to this city and 20% allocated to other cities. When applying, each cigarette factory must submit a tax bill from the Ministry of Finance and be certified by the association. It is reported that the quota for this batch of paper coupons has already been allocated. Factories that have not been allocated will be allocated when the second batch arrives. The current allocation price is under negotiation. It is rumored that it can be hoped to be at least 80% lower than the market price. It has also been decided that the task of allocating the second batch will be handled uniformly by the National Cigarette Industry Association and distributed widely to factories across the country.</p>
<p>Commercial Briefs</p>
<p>Regarding loan collateral and remittance, the salt merchants association will request a loan from the banking syndicate based on the current official price of 260,000 yuan per *dan*, deducting 100,000 yuan for salt tax and using 160,000 yuan for collateral remittance at a 70% discount. The banking syndicate has submitted a request to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval, which is currently under review.</p>
<p>The Four Banks Branch held its 112th regular meeting and approved ten loan applications totaling over 10 billion yuan, which will be submitted to the head office for approval.</p>

<h3>Speaking Frankly, "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" is an Important Document</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>When listening to people talk or reading their writings, I often feel that criticism of a new author easily falls into two clichés: either praising the book to the heavens or condemning it to the depths of hell, with very few balanced opinions. The criticism of Bernays's new book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" by people from various countries is no exception.</p>
<p>Those who praise the book believe that it is an outstanding masterpiece of international politics in recent years, and point out two major advantages of the book: First, because Bernays participated in the most secret international political negotiations before President Roosevelt's death, and was the US Secretary of State who mediated on the international stage after Truman succeeded as President, he said many things that ordinary people could not say; Second, because he is no longer directly involved in politics, he does not have to be as scrupulous as those who hold important positions in the current government, so he said many things that ordinary people would not dare to say. Some even consider him a true warrior fighting for the freedom of the world's people, and a giant who unyieldingly defends international justice. Therefore, his book is also regarded as an important classic in modern diplomatic history.</p>
<p>Those who criticize him and his book naturally have a different view. They say that Bernays is a spokesman for American capitalism, that he uses a set of hypocritical language, distorted secrets, and his current non-existent position to achieve his anti-Soviet goals hidden deep in his heart, and that he secretly wants to unite with the warmongers in the United States to prepare for a comeback, attempting to implement a policy of world domination. Leftists in various countries echo this view, and Soviet newspapers and senior government officials even call him a "war profiteer" without any emotion.</p>
<p>People with a more objective attitude cannot casually accept the above-mentioned extreme views, because these words are mostly the words of propagandists, not the views of serious critics. Propagandists have too much subjective content, they only know "black" and "white", and do not know that there are many different degrees of darkness and lightness between black and white. They only know how to make people believe what they believe, and do not know how to approach the truth from various positions and angles, and even to understand the truth. To gain benefits from reading, readers must have the spirit of understanding the truth from various angles and positions.</p>
<p>I often like to observe people quarreling from the sidelines, but I am unwilling to easily judge right and wrong. Based on experience, most quarrels arise from different positions leading to different viewpoints. "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" contains a large part of the record of several subtle quarrels between Bernays and Molotov. Since the evolution of US-Soviet relations is the mainstream of the world situation, and these quarrels can represent the different positions and viewpoints of the US and the Soviet Union, the content is very informative, and those who care about the fate of the world should read it. In fact, to understand the truth of international politics, Bernays's writings should be read, and if Molotov has any writings, they should also be read. The remarks of Vandenberg and Taft should be paid attention to, and the remarks of Wallace and Roosevelt Jr. should not be easily let go. The thoughts of moderate socialists such as Bevin and Attlee should be studied, and the movements of Conservative leader Churchill and Labour left-wing leader Bevan should also be constantly watched... By collecting the remarks of various experts and examining various political trends, if a judgment is to be made, it should be made at this time to be more practical and closer to the truth. Even with Bernays's "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy," it should be compared with the statements of other experts to carefully weigh what is right and wrong. If a book truly has value and truly contains the truth, then after such a comparison, this value and this truth will not be diminished, but will become more obvious, more concrete, and more prominent.</p>
<p>The different positions and differing viewpoints of the US and the Soviet Union are very obvious. Bernays particularly emphasizes in "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" that since the Yalta Conference, the Soviet Union's expansionist tendencies have become increasingly obvious, and the torrent of communism is spreading in all directions with the Soviet Union as its center. Although Stalin and other Soviet officials have repeatedly said that two different economies can coexist, and even cooperate with each other, some people in the United States believe that "words" are one thing, and "deeds" are another. Since the Soviet Union believes that communism is the ultimate destination of the world, then even temporary cooperation with capitalist countries is only a means, not an end. Therefore, the United States cannot trust it. As for the Soviet Union, it believes that although the United States advocates democratic politics and free competition, free competition tends to turn into monopoly to a considerable extent. The result of economic monopoly may lead to the decline of free competition domestically, and may lead to the competition for world markets, and even war. In the book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy," these fundamental contradictions between the US and the Soviet Union are clearly expressed.</p>
<p>The same shape may appear square from one angle, rectangular from another angle, and yet another shape from another angle. The same high mountain appears towering from the ground, but appears as flat as a mound from an airplane. Different positions lead to differences in the perception of all things in the world. The positions of the US and the Soviet Union are different, so the criteria for measuring each other are also different, and the decisions on policies are naturally difficult to be consistent. Due to the complexity of the problems and the multitude of issues involved, hasty judgments or oversimplification is not an attitude that a truth seeker should hold. Truth cannot be obtained with a mere wave of a hand or a step of the foot, but should be obtained from reading, thinking, and observing more. Newton discovered the three laws of motion, but Einstein modified them based on the theory of relativity, thus moving closer to the truth. This courageous spirit of scientists should also be the spirit that students of international politics should have.</p>
<p>Bernays is the former Secretary of State of the United States. During his tenure, the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union transitioned from wartime cooperation to peacetime antagonism. The book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" reflects the process of this transition. Objectively speaking, it should be an important source of information in modern diplomatic history.</p>
<h3>Honest Words</h3>
<p>— Deng Shuxun</p>
<p>Bernays's famous book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" was originally titled "Honest Words." Here, Bernays claims to have spoken honestly.</p>
<p>Whether Bernays has spoken honestly in his "Honest Words" is unknown (in fact, only he himself knows), but because he emphasizes that he has spoken honestly this time, it can indirectly prove that what he said in the past was not honest, and at the same time, it can further prove the unreliability of diplomats' words. More than "Inside USA" sold</p>
<h3>"The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy"</h3>
<p>— Lao Qi</p>
<p>According to a telegram from the United States: The book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" (originally titled Honest Words) by former US Secretary of State Bernays has seen astonishing sales since its publication on October 15, surpassing the book "Inside USA" by Gunther.</p>
<p>The success of this book is not accidental. In this book, Bernays reveals the secrets of the diplomatic meetings of the four powers before and after victory with an honest writing style. As American book reviews generally say, it is a factual account of the inside story of modern diplomacy, and at the same time, it implies the future trends of American national policy.</p>
<p>This is an essential diplomatic history. Now I will give a brief introduction to it. The book has 316 pages and is divided into five sections, each section is divided into four paragraphs. The table of contents is as follows: The Crisis of Awareness and Responsibility; Yalta - The Climax of Three-Power Unity; The Situation Begins to Change; Potsdam - Failure to Achieve Success; Frustration in London; The Moscow Conference Reaches a Stalemate; The London Conference Once, Paris Twice; The Paris Peace Conference and the New York Conference; Central Europe - Severe Trials; The Path of Action; Moving Towards Peace in Asia; Establishing a People's Diplomacy Policy; Control of Atomic Energy; What is the Soviet Union Pursuing? Where Are We Going From Here?</p>
<p>The last paragraph of the third section, "Moving Towards Peace in Asia," mentions China. Bernays begins by writing in a straightforward manner: "We must not forget that World War II broke out in the Pacific." This sentence illustrates the importance of Asia in the current crisis. He went on to say: "If we believe that Europe may become the fuse of a world war, then we must regard Asia as a very large flame." This is a very pertinent and accurate statement.</p>
<p>Regarding China, Bernays wrote: "China is still far from peace; what can be said is that China is on the verge of great change, and we should encourage and assist this change within the realm of possibility. China needs our technical assistance, but China should be responsible for implementation in order to achieve success." Here, he explains the importance of American aid to China, which is also understood by other American leaders, but the recent $300 million loan is really too disappointing.</p>
<p>Bernays also said: The importance of China is not only understood by the United States, but also by the Soviet Union. In this regard, he reveals the Soviet Union's intentions towards China. He proves that at the Yalta Conference, Stalin stated that the price of the Soviet Union's participation in the war was the joint management of the two major railways in Northeast China, turning Dalian into a free port, and establishing a naval base in Lushun.</p>
<p>Bernays also narrated his direct meeting with Stalin. Regarding this, Bernays said: "I told Stalin that Chairman Chiang's government is the only possible government in China. The Chinese Communist Party is not a real Communist Party." Stalin acknowledged in his reply that the National Government was the legitimate government. The most interesting thing is that Stalin believes that Mao Zedong exaggerated the strength of the Communist army too much. When Bernays told him that Mao Zedong boasted of having 600,000 troops in the Tianjin area, Stalin couldn't help but laugh a few times.</p>
<p>Regarding Asia, Bernays's conclusion is this: "The security of the United States itself and world peace depend on the progress of Asia." This is certainly a very accurate view. In the two years since the victory over Germany, Bernays has fought unremittingly for peace. He has traveled a total of 77,000 miles. From January 1945 to October 1946, he participated in a total of eight major conferences, namely: the Yalta Three-Power Conference from January 22 to February 12, 1945; the Potsdam Conference from July 6 to August 7; the London Foreign Ministers Conference from September 4 to October 8; the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference from December 12 to 29; the United Nations General Assembly held in London from January 7 to 25, 1946; the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference from April 23 to May 18 of the same year; the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference from June 13 to July 14 of the same year; and the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference from July 27 to October 17 of the same year. This masterpiece has been collectively translated by colleagues from the *Shen Bao*. I have read it once, and the translation is accurate, fluent, and beautiful. It will be published by News and World soon, and pre-orders are available at this newspaper.</p>
<p>I solemnly recommend this masterpiece and excellent translation to those who care about the interactions of the four powers.</p>
<h3>Bernays's Secrets</h3>
<p>— Pingzhai</p>
<p>When General Marshall returned from China to become Secretary of State, the news agencies spread a very interesting message, saying that his predecessor, Bernays, had prepared a thick volume of extremely secret "blueprints" and that Marshall only had to act according to the book, and there would be no mistakes. Many journalists tried to find out what was in this "blueprint," but repeated failures finally cooled their burning hearts.</p>
<p>Bernays has always been known in diplomatic circles for his eloquence and frankness, and this can be seen to some extent in his book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy." Of course, this book may not be the materials left to Marshall, but his frank personality did lead him to reveal many confidential materials—and from these confidential materials, it is not difficult for us to find out more confidential clues. When world politics becomes power politics, many small countries and nations become the sacrifices of bargaining. In order not to harm the self-esteem of these small countries and nations, everything is done behind the scenes, and everything becomes confidential. When these secrets are revealed to the world, people suddenly realize who has spread the seeds of disputes and even wars, but it is often too late.</p>
<p>The people who know the most about these secrets are of course the diplomats responsible for international mediation, especially the foreign ministers who oversee the diplomacy of a country. Bernays resolutely wrote this book, which, in the eyes of future historians, is an immortal achievement. I admire Bernays's courage, because after this book is published, his diplomatic career will probably never be restored.</p>
<h3>The Author of "Frankly Speaking," Burnes</h3>
<p>— Bin Zhi</p>
<p>Burnes was originally a junior clerk at the Carletons law firm. He used his spare time to learn shorthand and study law, eventually becoming a qualified lawyer. After that, he ran a newspaper, served as a judge, and slowly stepped onto the political stage. During World War I, he was the closest and most trusted assistant to Undersecretary of the Navy Roosevelt. In 1932, when Roosevelt ran for president, he was the only important figure behind the scenes. Although he did not broadcast, did not give speeches, did not write articles, and rarely appeared in public gatherings, he kept his finger on the pulse of American politics, guiding the development of the American political path.</p>
<p>After Roosevelt entered the White House, Burnes remained in the Senate. In 1941, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, seemingly temporarily ending his relationship with other American political issues. In fact, he was still Roosevelt's most trusted advisor, and his advice was sought on the decisions and execution of many issues. In 1943, Burnes assumed the post of Director of the Economic Stabilization Board, marking the beginning of his actual work on the American political stage as it moved towards global war. Later, he was reassigned as the Director of the War Mobilization Board, becoming the supreme commander on the American home front. After the victory, he was selected to handle the affairs of the Secretary of State, shuttling between the two sides of the Atlantic, and negotiating in the international arena to strive for world peace.</p>
<p>In previous international conferences, deadlocks were broken, and opposing opinions were reconciled. Although Burnes can be said to have achieved some success, it was the result of his countless painstaking efforts. "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" is a record of Burnes' participation in the previous meetings, not only a snapshot of the conference, but also a detailed record of the secrets beyond the conference and the tricks played by various countries. International relations are inherently complex, with intrigue and competition for dominance, and the post-war world appears even more intricate and mysterious. How Burnes broke the deadlock in international relations is fully revealed in "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy."</p>
<h3>Seeing the Soviet Diplomatic Style from "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy"</h3>
<p>— Jun Mo</p>
<p>After the outbreak of World War II, several books about the inside stories of diplomacy emerged, all written by people who personally took on the task of negotiation, such as former British Ambassador to Germany Henderson's "Failure of a Mission: Berlin 1937-1939," former US Ambassador to Japan Grew's "Ten Years in Japan," and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt's "For the President: Personal and Secret: Correspondence Between Franklin D. Roosevelt and William C. Bullitt." These books are all written with vivid prose and have their own value, but they also have a common shortcoming: the events described therein now seem like "yesterday's news," making us feel that they have little value as a reference. Only former Secretary of State Burnes' "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" (originally titled "Speaking Frankly"), published in the United States in mid-October, describes figures such as Truman, Stalin, Molotov, and Bevin, who are all key figures on the political stage, and the diplomatic secrets depicted in the book, the haggling in various important conferences, as well as the post-war settlement of Europe, diplomatic issues with China, etc., are still developing and have not been resolved. We have no way of knowing the actual inside story of international conferences, but after reading this book, it is as if we are sitting at the table with Truman, Stalin, and others, listening to them arguing heatedly one day and seeing them toasting each other the next. Moreover, we can also understand from this book how many of the diplomatic problems we face today, especially the issues of the Soviet Union and Dalian in Northeast China, have come about.</p>
<p>This book is truly as the title suggests, "Speaking Frankly," laying everything out without fire, without prejudice, but without concealing the facts, so after the book was published, many people criticized the author, saying that he should not have revealed so many facts so casually. But from this, we can also imagine the value of this book.</p>
<p>As a Chinese, we are naturally very concerned about the parts of the book that concern China and the Soviet diplomatic style. I think this book is extremely helpful in understanding the Soviet style. Here, let's just cite a few interesting examples to get a glimpse.</p>
<p>For example, the issue of reparations: after the Soviet army arrived in the Northeast, they took away the machinery and materials from our Northeast, leaving the factories empty shells. However, they said that these were their "spoils of war." The situation was the same in Europe. After the Soviet army entered Romania, the German army retreated, and the Romanian oil fields originally had many properties of British and American merchants, including extremely valuable machinery. These machines had been frozen when the Germans occupied them. Later, after Germany surrendered and Romania was liberated, Burnes mentioned to Molotov about reclaiming these properties of the British and Americans, but the Soviet Union refused. Their reason was very ridiculous. They said: many of these machines were ordered from German manufacturers by British and American merchants before the war, so there were "Made in Germany" trademarks on them. Since these machines were made in Germany before, then they are certainly not British or American, so they are spoils of war and can be confiscated. The definition of spoils of war was originally limited to the enemy's war materials obtained in the war, but as a result, even the furniture, sofas, and vases in the houses in Berlin were taken away by Soviet officers. In this way, the issue of reparations could not be calculated at all. The American side questioned the Soviet Union about this, but the Soviet Union had another set of inexplicable explanations, even explaining pianos, sofas, and vases as war materials, so they were often treated as spoils of war, leaving the American reparations commissioner Pauley dumbfounded and speechless for a long time.</p>
<p>Another thing can also be cited to see what kind of attitude should be adopted when dealing with diplomacy with the Soviet Union. At the Potsdam Conference, for several issues, the Soviet Union insisted on its own opinions and refused to budge, and it was about to end without results. Burnes came up with a way to put the two things that the United States insisted on and the issue of reparations that the Soviet Union hoped to resolve together into one proposal, and explained the maximum limit that the United States could accept, and then asked the Soviet Union to decide, to agree to all three things together, or to oppose all three things together. If they opposed, the American representatives would leave Potsdam and return home the next day, and the meeting would not continue. Stalin was initially very dissatisfied, thinking that Burnes was using "this cunning trick," selling rotten apples and good apples together, so he requested individual discussions. But Burnes insisted on discussing them together. As a result, Stalin had no choice but to agree to all three things because he did not want the issue of reparations to remain unresolved, so the meeting took a sharp turn for the better and ended successfully. Burnes initially thought that Stalin would be very unhappy with him for this matter, but unexpectedly, just the opposite, when the meeting ended, and the two sides raised their glasses to congratulate each other, Stalin specifically mentioned to Truman, thanking and admiring Burnes' efforts, which made the matter successfully resolved.</p>
<p>There are many other examples in the book that prove that Russians respond to strength, not weakness. Whenever you concede, they will take an inch and want a mile, and there is no end; but when you insist on your position and do not waver, they will admire you and concede themselves.</p>
<p>This is the experience personally gained by the author of this book, former US Secretary of State Burnes, in handling diplomacy with the Soviet Union. This experience is still of great reference value to us today.</p>

<h3>Rare News of Elizabeth's Wedding</h3>
<p>— Lin Lin</p>
<p>For Princess Elizabeth's wedding procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey, windows in buildings along the route were rented out at high prices, with profits exceeding those of the 1937 coronation ceremony.</p>
<p>On Whitehall, where the procession could be seen for two or three minutes, the rental price for two windows had reached 100 pounds. During the coronation, the rental price for the entire room was only 50 pounds. According to one landlord's estimate, the annual rent for a room there is only 100 pounds. Now it is rented to twenty-two people at a high price of 900 pounds, which translates to 40 pounds per person. Each window seat is also rented for 75 pounds.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard notified all landlords that anyone who bought tickets to watch the procession from the windows must leave their names with the police station.</p>
<p>The design of Elizabeth's wedding cake has been approved by the princess. The cake is divided into four layers. The first layer features the emblems of the new couple, the Windsor crest, the Beaumont crest, and the Buckingham Palace cupola. The second layer features the jewel box the princess received when she was conferred the honorary freedom of Windsor; the princess inspecting troops as the Colonel of the Guards; the Battle of Monte Cassino; various musical symbols; and patterns of various sports. The third layer is a Cupid holding a shield with the initials of the new couple inscribed, the Royal Navy emblem, the emblems of the Auxiliary Territorial Service and the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, and the HMS Valiant, the flagship that Captain Mountbatten served on during the Battle of Monte Cassino. The fourth layer features the national emblems of the Dominions, namely Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Pakistan.</p>
<p>According to British custom, the queen still takes her father's surname after marriage, but her children take their husband's surname. Therefore, Victoria became the last of the Hanoverians, and her son Edward VII became the first of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line. However, the dynastic name can also be changed by decree, as the British royal family changed its name to Windsor in 1917. Therefore, the British royal family will be surnamed Windsor, while Elizabeth's children will be surnamed Mountbatten.</p>

<h3>Elizabeth—Various Things on the Eve of the Wedding</h3>
<p>— Broken Wheel</p>
<p>November 20th is the date of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth of Britain and Lieutenant Mountbatten. The ceremony will be held at Westminster Abbey. This wedding is a major event in British history; because Princess Elizabeth is not only the heir to the British throne, but also the heir to the thrones of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa under the Statute of Westminster.</p>
<p>The wedding is quite grand, although in the face of the post-war British recession, everything has been frugal, but it is still dazzling enough. The work of preparing for the ceremony falls on the Lord Chamberlain, who ranks at the head of the court, and the work is indeed very complicated. This minister is Lord Clarendon, who is already seventy years old, and has presided over hundreds of court ceremonies. Behind his court dress is a embroidered key, indicating that the keys to the palace are under his control.</p>
<p>This wedding cannot be equated with a state ceremony, it belongs to a semi-state affair. Therefore, although all the rituals of a royal wedding will be followed, the ceremony will be reduced compared to a full state ceremony. The most important and significant result of this decision is that male guests do not have to wear the court dress of exquisitely gold-trimmed coats, knee breeches, and cocked hats. Morning dress, military uniform, or even casual wear is appropriate; female guests will wear afternoon dresses with hats, and the length of skirts and dresses is at their own discretion.</p>
<p>But Princess Elizabeth will take the state ceremonial escort of the British monarch in a four-horse open carriage, accompanied by a full complement of coachmen, from the palace to the temple for the ceremony; and the groom will also use a carriage escort, as will the Queen and Princess Margaret. As for the exact time of departure and arrival at the temple, this is also one of the details to be decided by Lord Clarendon. About two thousand invitations to the ceremony are being distributed. The issuance of these invitations is a slightly difficult matter for some people. Naturally, the royal family and the groom's family must attend, as well as the cabinet ministers of the British government and the leaders of the opposition parties, to show that political boundaries are irrelevant to happy events. All foreign envoys in London, whether ambassadors, ministers, or chargés d'affaires, must also receive invitations. The same is true for the High Commissioners of the British Commonwealth in London. Although not all Commonwealth Prime Ministers may attend, there will always be a few who will attend the ceremony in person. Invitations to the royal families of Europe were announced on October 31st. The list includes the King of Norway, the King of Romania, the King and Queen of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia, Queen Eugenia of Spain, Dowager Queen Marie of Yugoslavia, Prince Charles of Belgium, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard, the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden, Prince Axel of Greece, Prince and Princess George of Greece, Prince Christopher of Greece, Princess Eugenie of Greece, Princess Axel and Prince Borghese of Denmark, Prince George of Denmark, Prince Fay of Denmark, Prince John and Princess Elizabeth of Luxembourg. There are 103 seats for journalists in the sanctuary of the Western Church, and their distribution is 22 seats for British Commonwealth newspapers, 13 seats for foreign newspapers, 12 seats for American newspapers, and 57 seats for British newspapers.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of wood, steel, and manpower, there will be no magnificent decorations on the streets as there were during the coronation, and there will be no stands along the way. Westminster Abbey will also not have any special decorations. But British children will receive a packet of food.</p>
<p>The ceremony will definitely be held in a religious form. The ceremony will probably be presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and assisted by the Archbishop of York.</p>
<p>There will be no ball to celebrate the wedding, because the Ministry of Food stipulates that social activities are limited to 100 guests. In order to accelerate the export plan, there will be no public holidays, but schools will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>King George VI broke the tradition of 250 years and decided to accept the words of allegiance offered by the Roman Catholic Church in Britain at the Princess's wedding. Since King James II (a Catholic) abdicated in 1689, Roman Catholics, including cardinals and bishops, have not been able to directly offer tributes to the British monarch.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Winter Relief</h3>
<p>— Listening to Autumn</p>
<p>The winter relief fundraising organized by charitable people from all walks of life and the Social Affairs Bureau, gentlemen from the entertainment industry have been broadcasting charity performances for days. Everyone is doing their best to fulfill their responsibility of "contributing their efforts"; calling for help on behalf of the poor, and asking the "rich" to donate generously!</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau originally planned to attach 20% of the film ticket price to the winter relief donation. This method was originally to relieve the poor, increase the income of relief funds, so that the poor people can drink more porridge!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, film merchants only care about their own interests and vigorously oppose the additional donation; although the director of the Social Affairs Bureau insisted on compulsory collection again and again. But how can they fight against the film merchants who hold the real power? They even jointly stated that if they are determined to collect relief donations, they would rather withdraw the film and stop showing it as a protest.</p>
<p>The additional collection of relief donations on movie tickets has been canceled from the original plan, and other methods have been formulated. The income of relief funds will inevitably be affected.</p>
<p>Following that, the winter relief horse racing is bound to be another empty proposal that cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>Look! The Wanguo Sports Association has already released a statement. Excuse: Because of years of stagnation, it is not easy to gather and organize it at once. The meaning is: unwilling to do unprofitable charity races that only require "effort". Therefore, whether the winter relief horse racing can be implemented is still uncertain.</p>
<p>The poor who are suffering from hunger and cold are suffering bitterly. The winter relief fundraising has suffered a double blow, and the income of relief funds will inevitably be affected.</p>
<h3>The Fish That Climbs Trees</h3>
<p>— Lin Mei</p>
<p>"Climbing a tree to catch fish" is a Chinese idiom, which means that if we want to catch fish, we must go to the water. If we climb trees to catch fish, we are going the wrong way and we will not get the fish. Of course, this is correct. However, you must know that the world is a strange world, and the path you take may as well be two, but the goal achieved can be one. For example, invaders can use force to achieve their purpose of invasion, but if you use political methods or economic power to invade people, this can also achieve the same purpose as force. This is called "different routes to the same destination."</p>
<p>You must go to the water to catch fish, but you can also catch fish by climbing a tree. Friends, are you surprised to see me say this? No need! The world is so big, there are all kinds of wonders, and it is not that there are no fish walking on land or climbing trees. For example, when we go to the countryside, we don't need to talk about any remote places that are not easy to find on the map. Just take the suburbs of Shanghai as an example. In the small rivers in the countryside, there is often a kind of small fish that comes out of the water and jumps on the wetlands by the river. The villagers call this kind of small fish "Luhe", and its scientific name is salamander, so it is not that there are no fish walking on land.</p>
<p>In the West Indies, there is a kind of fish called "climbing fish", which has a special habit. Every once in a while, it has to climb out of the water and walk on land for a while. Sometimes, it also climbs up the roots of trees by the river like a naughty kitten. However, it does not climb very high, only a few inches. Like other fish, it has no feet, and uses its fins to stand up its body.</p>
<p>This is not nonsense. We can see the specimens of this kind of fish in museums; if you live near an aquarium, you can see active fish in the aquarium! If there is no aquarium where you live, then in March and April, you can also see a salamander walking on land in the small rivers in the suburbs of Shanghai. It can also climb a few inches on the roots of trees, but its shape is not very similar to the fish we usually eat. However, this can prove that fish can climb trees, and "green wood" may be able to "catch fish."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes Under the Lamp: What Kind of Jinshi (Successful Candidate in the Imperial Examinations) Was Grand Historian Sima Qian?</h3>
<p>— Feng Ren</p>
<p>Wang Yuxiang's Xiangzu Notes has the following passage:</p>
<p>"When Song Lichang, the provincial governor, was reading a book attentively, there came a dignified old scholar who was a successful candidate. He asked, "What book is the child reading?" The History Records was answered. He asked, "Who wrote it?" He replied, "The Grand Historian." He asked, "What kind of Jinshi (Successful Candidate in the Imperial Examinations) was Grand Historian Sima Qian?" He replied, "The Grand Historian of the Han Dynasty was not today's Jinshi." So he took the book and read it, but after a few lines, he discarded it and said, "I don't see anything good, what's the point of reading it?" Then he walked away in a dignified manner." This is certainly a joke today, but it was indeed a very common fact at the time. The imperial examination was originally intended to bind the thoughts of scholars, so that they would specialize in the so-called classics of the Analects and the Book of Songs, and not to have them find their original shape from history, so it is really no wonder that the Jinshi did not read history.</p>
<h3>Shadow Plays of the Han Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Zhu Li</p>
<p>Li Furen, the concubine of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, had a very good appearance, so she was especially loved by the emperor. After Li died, the emperor missed her constantly. At that time, there was a magician Shao Weng from Qi, who said that he could bring her spirit, and the emperor believed him and watched him do it, and indeed saw a beautiful woman like Li Furen. The emperor saw her and missed her even more sadly, and once wrote a poem saying: "Is it her? Is it not her? Standing and looking at her, why does she come so slowly!"</p>
<p>As for how the magician did it, there is the following record in the Book of Han: "The magician Shao Weng from Qi said that he could bring her spirit, so he set up lanterns and candles at night, set up tents and curtains, arranged wine and meat, and ordered the emperor to live in another tent, and remotely saw a beautiful woman like Li Furen, returning to the tent and walking around, but he was not allowed to approach and see…"</p>
<p>After reading the above sentence "set up lanterns and candles at night, set up tents and curtains," you can imagine that its method is the same as the principle of shadow plays.</p>
<p>Miss America</p>
<h3>Miss America and Victory Gardens</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>"Victory Garden" was a product of World War II. The American people were not a flower-loving nation and engaged in horticulture because they were "forced to do so." Because all food was under control during the war, canned food was especially strictly controlled. Americans would not starve to death, but when the war started, a large number of cans were transported to the front, and ordinary people could not buy enough food, so they had to loosen the soil in front of and behind their houses and turn it into gardens. They bought bags of seeds from grocery stores and started to cultivate them in a big way. There were many kinds of seeds, no less than hundreds of kinds. Each bag cost one dime, and the contents were printed in color on the bag, allowing people to choose. Families usually planted tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants, pearl rice, celery, and melons, and also raised chickens and ducks. In this way, they could reduce the family burden and encourage family labor, saving the time they spent in movie theaters, nightclubs, and bars for productive work.</p>
<p>Miss America attaches great importance to victory gardens. The word "victory" foreshadows "the inevitable victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction." The most significant meaning of victory gardens is to make hundreds of thousands of families of soldiers in the War of Resistance happy. When their husbands are fighting bloody battles overseas, and their life and death are unpredictable, they can spend a large part of their lonely time in horticulture. In this way, they can purify their minds, reduce their desires, and quietly wait for their husbands to return home in triumph. Therefore, victory in gardens has made great contributions to moral construction during the war. This kind of invisible moral defense is more effective than the propaganda and deception of "those who eat moral rice, who have mouths full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but are male thieves and female prostitutes in their bellies." What a soldier who was born and died overseas hopes for when he lays down his arms and returns to the fields is two things that make him feel satisfied: the first thing is that his wife has not run away with anyone, and there is still Wang Tian (land) to cultivate; the second thing is that there is a victory garden behind the house, where he can try the leisurely years of "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence" and forget the cruel experience of bayonet fighting on the front line. Where does the hope of a veteran lie? He wants a loyal wife, a quiet home, and a green vegetable garden. American soldiers have got what they wanted in all three things.</p>
<p>Social Service</p>
<h3>Provisional Measures for Collecting Security Deposits for Public Utilities</h3>
<p>The Social Services Section of your newspaper forwarded a letter from Mr. Wang Fangrui, a citizen, regarding the question of the French Concession Electricity Company's increased water charges before September 1, and requested that we verify it and reply directly. We have checked that the adjustment of water prices in September was approved by the Municipal Government. Starting from the meter reading date of September 1, the new prices are calculated. Therefore, the company's calculation based on the new prices on the meter reading date is in line with the original plan and there is no conflict. As for the section in the original letter involving the increase in security deposits, in order to avoid excessive burden on users, this Bureau proposed the "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Security Deposits for Public Utilities in Shanghai Municipality", which was passed by the 86th Municipal Conference. Accordingly, a copy of the measures is attached and returned to you for reference! This is addressed to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Sincerely, the Public Utilities Bureau of Shanghai Municipality.</p>
<p>Provisional Measures for the Agreement on the Collection of Security Deposits for Public Utilities in Shanghai Municipality. Since July 1947, the increase in security deposits for various public utilities shall be limited to twice a year, with a time interval of six months between the two times. The amount of each increase shall be based on the standard of supplementing the user's one-month consumption cost. For each increase in security deposits, the company may consider the situation and collect it in one or two installments. The security deposit for new users shall be calculated based on the unit price of the month of use and the estimated consumption for one month.</p>
