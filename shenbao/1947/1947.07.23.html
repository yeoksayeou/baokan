<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕美總統私人代表魏德邁將軍一行十人，乘C54第四九一四九號銀色專機，於廿二日下午五時廿分在京大較塲空軍茲地着陸，魏氏身材修長，精神飽滿，衣天藍色白麻點西裝，結絲製藍白花領帶，履黑皮鞋，手持白色寬沿草帽，首先出現於機門，對盛大之歡迎羣領首爲禮，徵笑步下機悌，與司徒雷登大使，凌司長其翰，府委宋子文，吳文官長鼎昌（蔣主席代表），甘秘長乃光（張院長羣代表），白部長崇禧，陳參謀總長誠及翁委員長文灝，沈市長怡等一一握手寒暄，於悠揚樂禮聲中檢閱國府儀仗隊後，即與司使及隨行人等相偕赴上海路美大使官邸休息，並共進晚餐，魏氏留居官邸樓上司使之鄰房，其隨行人等則赴美大使館內預爲布置之房舍安歇。據其新聞顧間華生語記者，渠等於晨六時半飛離關島，一路極平安愉快，在京日程尙未確定，唯將儘速獲得各種有關之資料，作初步之研究。渠等將吾南京爲此行之工作基地，然後赴北方，進行事實調查，如環境許可，蘇軍控制下之韓國北部，亦將爲調查對象。華生確稱：魏氏未携帶任何私人函件，代表團之任務必期於六星期內完成之。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕外交部息：杜魯門總統私人特別代表魏德邁將軍，定廿三日上午十一時赴國民政府覲見蔣主席，下午二時半赴政院，拜會張羣院長，三時半赴外部，拜會王世杰部長，晚應蔣主席夫婦邀宴。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕魏德邁將軍此次來京，擬竭力減少應酬，渠以爲此項應酬可能佔其工作時問，而來華期間又極短暫，絕不容許浪費。行政院畏張羣，廿二日在政院例會中曾對此事提出報吿，謂係魏氏之意見，據目前所知，除蔣主席夫婦之宴會外，美大使館將舉行一感大酒會，我政府方面將由各首長聯合歡宴一次。</p>

<h3>魏特使發表談話</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處南京廿二日電〕魏德邁將軍廿二日抵京，開始對中國與朝鮮之情形作六里期之實地調查，頃向新聞記者發表談話如下：</p>
<p>「余上次在中國榮任蔣委員長參謀長，兼駐華美軍總司令之職，爲時頗久，離華以來，已一年有餘。此番重臨舊地，在此與諸位老友再度聚首，至爲欣慰。余一向期望重領此種友誼之溫情。惜余此次留華時期甚短，余之時間與精神必須不斷致力於對中。美兩國極重要之工作，故余預料彼此把晤之時間不多，未免引爲遺憾耳。</p>
<p>關於未來六星期應做之工作，余僅作一般性之概述。余奉美國總統之命，前來調查中國與朝鮮之一般情形，即最近兩國之現實局勢及其未來復興之能力。余之使命其基本性質爲調查事實，由專家一小隊襄助一切，此等專家對於經濟·財政·工程與政治各方面，均有豐富之經騐，我等所最關切者，爲獲悉中國政府爲期望復興而採取之措施，其效能如何。</p>
<p>完成我等之任務，其期限甚爲短促。我使團中之人員，必須以全部時間致力搜求及評估各種報道，此種報道，不但對於中國，朝鮮及美國至關重要，而且對於全世界亦顯然具有重要之關係。余決定吾人之工作將具有眞正及時之價値。果爾，則吾人必須以毫無成見之態度，負起此項賣任。</p>
<p>由於健全與審愼之籌劃，最可能獲得良好之結果，此種籌劃不但基於吾人所希望爲眞實之事，而且蓋於吾人由於客觀與澈底之老察而確知爲眞實之事。</p>
<p>余此一聲明，說明余何以目下尙不能提出任何期望或意向之聲明，但有一點可以奉吿者，即余將儘余之能力，履行杜魯門總統授余之指令，以確定一切關於政治，經濟與軍事情形之事實，不論有利或不利者，將此等事實彼此互作聯緊，然後加以評估，並在余之使命吿終之時，將此事工作之結果提呈美國總統」。</p>

<h3>經濟改革方案全文</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿二日電〕全國經濟委員會二十一日通過之經濟改革方案，已送由行政院轉呈國府，定二十五日提出國務會議討論，俟國務會議通過後公布施行。該案經各專家研討修正後，已更較原案究密，茲探覓經委會通過之方案全文如次：</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>我國以嚴立國，地大物博，勞力充沛，而目前經濟上之危機，日趨嚴重，亟應先探討其癥結所在，以爲改革之依據。按經濟活動，以生產爲大前提，生產之要素有三：即土地資本勞力，農村所缺者唯資本，而一般金融機構，尙不能接受土地作抵押，亦尙無專業之土地金融機構。目前各銀行之農貸，又爲數甚微，無濟於事，是我國地大物博，勞力充沛之優點未盡發揮，實　於缺乏充足金融之滋養。今後政策，如何從利用大多數人民之能力處着手？金融變講本身如何健全與充實？其資金如何與土地勞力配合得宜？以達到蠱村繁榮，農民購買力提高，而奠定最展國內民生工業之義礎。至於各銀行之業務，均應有明確之分工，各有所專司，各有其使命，互爲發展經濟之一壞，此爲金融上應亟求改革者。其次，如何使農業國趨向於工業化，實爲今後建國最主要之課題。我國各種生產建設事業之發展，應有全盤之計劃，即使合人民與政府之力量，依照計劃，分工合作，以求進展，尙處不足，而事實上，工業則國營民營分際不淸，致一方面力有未逮，一方面瞻顧不前，而政府扶植各種民營企業，未盡其功；至廠房廠地興機器等固定資產，國營民營均未獲得充分作抵押之便利，以作再生產之用，各種金業自難望其有計劃之發展。今後如何以國家資本爲前驅，輔導私人資本之活躍，以國營事業任其難，扶助民營事業任其易，使政府與人民通力合作，並以優惠方式，歡迎外國資本與技術人才，以達到工業化之目的，此爲生產建設上應亟求改革者。再次，財政應自發達各種生　　業備手，方可期收入之比例增加，政府預算一日未能平衡，通貨不免增發，加以　總資金之眞正用於生產者，亦爲通貨膨脹，致生產萎縮，物資缺乏，物價飛騰，利率激漲，因而稅源枯涸，收支益趨懸殊，過去不從增加及監督生產之有效方法以圖解決，而僅顧及一時因難之補救，採取治標之措施，均屬得不償失，今後如何從幣制本身切實老量，如何開源節流，改善征收方針，使財政基礎隨各種生產事業之發展而增厚，以數萬萬人之生產能力及其總收入支持整個國家之財政，此爲財政上應亟求改革者。茲簡述以上三者改革方策要項如左：</p>
<p>（甲）關於金融者</p>
<p>金融制度之改革，必須特別注意爲國家經濟政策服務，以達到地盡其利（農），物盡其用（工），貨暢其流（商），爲其主要之目的，金融機構應各有其主要增進生產之專門業務，使普通商業化之現象，得以消除，公私銀行並須有計劃的分布全國，使之成爲有系統之金融網，不致集中沿海沙數都市，尤其是上海一隅，造成偏頗之現象二關於金融組織與業務之改革辦法，茲列舉於后：</p>
<p>（一）縣銀行爲金融制度之茲府機構，應澈底重建，並扶植其發展，其主要業務爲發展農村經濟，便利地方建設，並配合地方自治之推行，其設置以每縣一行爲原則，其資金由懸政府以縣鄉鎭之公款投資，並可招收民股，同時應由中央銀行及省銀行酌量投資，作爲提倡股，並應供給專門人才及予以業務上之輔導與監督。</p>
<p>懸銀行視其業務上之類別及需要，分別由中國晨民銀行，交通銀行或中國銀行予以協助。</p>
<p>（二）省銀行以調劑本省金融，扶助經濟建設，開發本省生產事業爲其主要業務。</p>
<p>省銀行在省會所在地設置，其分行設置地點，僅以本省重要政治經濟中心地點爲限。</p>
<p>（三）土地金融應由政府指定專款，並發行土地債劵，在適當時期另設專行以司其事。</p>
<p>（四）中國農民銀行以扶助農村繁榮爲其專業之範圍，經營農業生產，農田水利，農產運銷，以及土地金融等貨款，以便利農民。</p>

<p>（八）中央合作金庫以合作貸款扶植各種合作社之組織及發展爲專業之範圍。</p>
<p>（九）中央信託局專司信託再保險及公營事業之保險，並對民營之信託保險業務負輔導之任務。</p>
<p>（十）中央銀行爲銀行之銀行、以調劑全國金融，使金融與經濟密切聯緊以協助經濟建設爲其主要之職責</p>
<p>（十一）四聯總處俟復員完成後，改爲設計與聯緊之機構、或與財政部錢幣司合併，改爲金融管理局，隸屬於財政部，以一事權。</p>
<p>（十二）民營銀行之分類及分佈，由政府于以規定，其資本額度應予提高，各小銀行錢莊應使之合併組織，以充實其資力，其資金運用，由政府規定標準，嚴格管理。</p>
<p>（十三）各國家銀行應依其專業範圍，對性質相同之普通銀行業務負聯緊輔導之任務，其設置分支行處之範圍及地點，並應依其業務對象分別予以規定。（下文轉入第二版）</p>

<h3>經濟改革方案全文</h3>
<p>上文接第一版</p>
<p>（乙）關於生產建設者</p>
<p>目前各種生產事業萎縮，全國人力物力未盡發揮，政府今後所採之方針，應爲：（一）對於現在之生產建設事業儘量予以保護，以安定在業，防止失業。（二）以有效之計劃·使新的生產建設事業逐漸增加，引導游閑坐食之人力，轉而參加生產。（三）獎勵科學發明，提倡勞働服務？以轉移士風，鼓勵創造事業之精神。（四）以計劃敎育配合計劃經濟，使人才之培養與生產之建設打成一片，農工生產增加，輔以交通之便利，激勵創造，歡迎外資，物價自漸趨穩定。關於發電農業工業商業交通及增產物資穩定物價各辦法，茲列舉於後：</p>
<p>一，農業：農民佔國民之絕對之多數，農業爲中國經濟之骨幹，農業發達，農村繁榮，農民有其購買力，然後工業有所憑藉，社會得以安定。故發展農業、繁榮農村，乃今後經濟政策實施之主要對象，其辦法：</p>
<p>（一）改革農地之分配關係，使能充分改良，利用租佃關係，應依「二五减租」之原則，澈底推行，並盡量設法實施「耕者有其田」，使農民能從事生產。</p>
<p>（二）獎勵墾殖，並擇地試辦集體農塲及合作農塲，利用新式機器及方法，增加生產，以示範於農民，並擴充農業試騐研究塲所，以增進生產技術。</p>
<p>（三）農業改革，水利爲重·大型水利工程及幹渠之修築，應由國家積極舉辦，小型水利工程及支渠之修築，應由中央督促省縣辦理，得請准發行水利公債，其己完成之工程，並由地方負保養之責。</p>
<p>（四）擴充並健全農村合作組織，確實便利農貸手續，以减輕農民負担</p>
<p>（五）常平倉制度亟須建立，長江流域各車要地點，必須從速完成初步建倉儲糧計劃，地方積榖，亦應加强推動，普遍實施，以厚儲備。</p>
<p>（六）中國農民銀行對於農倉儲押農產運銷業務，應積極推廣，期以金融力量，協同政府扶助生產，控制糧源，調劑盈虛。</p>
<p>（七）廣設苗圃，提倡造林，並須以有效之辦法，保持其成長。至天然林，保安林，應歸國有與國營，其他宜林荒山與荒地，應督導民營，並應注意薪炭林之經營與獎勵。</p>
<p>（八）利用農暇，訓練農民以土木石工等技術，並發展農村副業，以提高農民生活。</p>
<p>（九）畜牧事業，應注意防治獸疫，改善牲畜品質，增高牲畜種頻，提倡畜產增加，凡農業區域內，應增飼料作物，利用荒地，擴充牲產飼養，凡天然游收區域，仍以發展畜收爲本，並加强收區管理，培養草原，增植改良飼料，以期穩定並增進畜收生產，改善牧民生計。</p>
<p>（十）發展海及江湖之漁業與水產，獎進農家養魚，並提倡水產加工事業。（未完）</p>

<h3>社論　魏德邁來華之後</h3>
<p>魏德邁將軍已於昨日午後五時，自關島飛抵南京，由美國政　經濟問題專家所組成之事實調査團，亦於同時到達我國首都；並自今日起，卽將展開其調査中國政治經濟實際情形的工作。我們站在中國人民的立塲，對於這位「中國之友」魏德邁將軍的東來，不問其所負的任務是否重大，不論其所負的使命能否成功，終不能不表示十二分眞摯的歡迎。茲乘魏將軍卽將開始進行工作之際，一述我們中國人民的共同願望。</p>
<p>第一，我們首先，要向魏德邁將軍指出的，就是中國目前的情形，不論在政治上經濟上，無一不在動亂狀態之中，但是這種紊亂的局勢，只能視爲戰後世界政治的縮影，而不能目爲亞洲或世界的亂源。明瞭了中國政局的此一特質，始能對症下藥，使中國的沉疴得有回春的希望；否則僅靠了魏德邁將軍個人對於中國的感情，促成美國以若干物質的援助，界予中國。不僅對於中國無濟於事，就是杜魯門總統任命魏德邁將軍東來的最終目的，也是不會完全實現的！</p>
<p>第二，我們要進一步說明中國局勢演化到這種地步，決非中國人民或政府一方面的責任。我們不妨回憶一下，自日本屈膝投降以來的遠東局勢，日本雖因戰敗而暫時退出遠東的政治舞台，但是在另一方面，却增加了蘇聯在遠東政治舞台上的重要性；我國外交當局對於戰後遠東局勢的變遷，洞若觀火，故特別重視對蘇外交，甚至不惜重大的代價，以換取蘇聯的友誼，中蘇同盟友好條約的簽字，就是一個絕好的證助；但是我們償付了一筆相當可觀的代價所獲得的結果，却是（一）搬走我國東北的工業設備；（二）阻撓我國接收旅順大連；（三）外蒙軍侵入我國新疆省；（四）韓共與日俘竟參加東北的共軍作亂；試問在這種情形之下，中國在政治上怎能和平統一？在經濟上又怎能安定繁榮？！</p>
<p>第三，不待我們說明，魏德邁將軍就會知道，中國在這次大戰期間所受的損失，較之歐洲任何一國爲大，戰後中國創鉅痛深，欲言復興繁榮，自然需要外來的協助，日本的賠償問題旣一時不能解決：中國人民的希望，自然而然寄託在我盟國的身上。但是右數月之前，馬歇爾國務卿不惜百億鉅款，援助歐洲各國復興，但對於中國，却將已撥出而未放出的五億貸款，竟留着不肯放出來。美國這種仍不脫歐洲第一主義的作風，當然不免要引起中國人民對淤美國政策的懷疑；好在魏德邁將軍現已奉命來華，這些不應有的誤會，自可一掃而空了。我們很願坦白奉吿魏德邁將軍，中美兩國在戰時是駢肩作戰的盟國，曾飽經患難：現在到了大戰之後，中國自仍希望美國的協助，俾使中美兩國，能向着共同的理想邁進。所以中國不忘舊情，竭誠希望美國的協助，絕非出於自私的動機，我們相信魏德邁將軍對於這一點，一定能諒解的。</p>
<p>要之，魏德邁將軍是我們的「中國之友」不僅已認淸中國的政情；而且最能了解中國人民的感情與願望；現在時隔一年又三個月，再度來華，昨日飛抵南京，舊地重遊，一定倍覺親切。我們不願多言，但願魏德邁將軍，多多觀察事實，多多接觸我國朝野，從而理解中國，從而認淸遠東，於六個星期內，完成任務，將其調査所得，一一報吿杜魯門總統，作爲美國改變其對華政策的張本！</p>
<h3>爲基本教育呼籲</h3>
<p>聯合國遠東區基本敎育會議，不久將在我國舉行，敎育部爲了綜合各方的意見，已於本月十日召開了一個預備會議，特請專家六十餘人出　，會期三天，已於十二日閉幕。大會由敎育部朱部長主持，通過了許多關於基本敎育的要案，並預備舉行展覽會。但是我們自己人民的基本敎育狀况是怎樣的呢？在這僩盛會舉行的前夕，我們應先作一下忠實的檢討。</p>
<p>目前全國自六歲至十二歲的學齡兒童，約計六千七百萬。（其中百分之七十五在鄕村，百分之十五在城市，百分之十在邊疆。）而入學的祇有二千七百萬，占全部學齡兒童三分之一强，其餘百分六十左右的學齡兒童還沒有享受到基本的敎育。祇有台灣省的八七八，五八〇名學齡兒童中，已有百分之九十五入學。全國文盲竟占百分之七十二，這是從「量」的一方面看我們人民的基本敎育。</p>
<p>學齡兒童的健康情形，更令人可怕，根據教育部張天麟氏視察京·滬·魯各地國民敎育的報吿，認爲學齡兒童身體健康的僅占百分之十，不健全的占百分之九十，營養不良的占百分之五十，患沙眼者達白分之八十，這實在是觸目驚心的可怕數字，這實在是我們國家最嚴重的問題。國民學校敎師的資格：師範畢業者占百分之三六·三九，其他學校畢業者占百分之四七·五八，非學校出身者百分之一六·三，三十五年五月報載十四個省市三萬小學敎師資格的統計，初中初職畢業者居多，他們都沒有受過健全的師資訓練；至於學校設備的簡陋，敎材敎具的缺乏，敎學方法的墨守成法，都是有目共睹的事實。因此，學生的程度，有人估計比戰前降低了二年。</p>
<p>國民學校的成人部，原爲文盲的補習敎育，更等於虛設，從全國大多數的鄉村看來，這幾乎成了法令上及敎師在講堂上演講的名辭。敎育部根據各地的報吿說三十四年度全國已有七百萬成人，三百萬婦女在受補習敎育，就算這些數字是正確的，以我國的文盲爲比例，也談不上成人敎育的成績。這是從「質」的方面看我國的基本敎育情形。</p>
<p>至於各縣初等敎育的經費，在過去，各地方原有敎育款產委員會等的組織，却有點獨立的性質。自民國三十年新縣制施行以來，縣財政統收統支，國民敎育經費從百分之三四十左右，跌落到百分之五。三十六年縣預算祗列中心國民學校，把一般的國民敎育經費叫鄉保自籌，於是大多數農村裏所謂一保一校的計劃，祗剩了一所空空落落的破廟門前掛上一塊校牌而己。這是基本敎育的經費情形。</p>
<p>我國敎育行政向由中央主辦高等敎育，省主辦中等敎育，縣主辦初等敎育，所以大學經費，敎育部會向行政院力爭，敎授又是文化的領導者，學生又有罷課請願遊行的能力。敎育廳則往往集中力量辦中等敎育，所以大中學的經費儘管困苦，若比起國民敎育來，又要聊勝一籌了。中央和省補助國民敎育的經費都微薄異常。基本敎育經費的來源中央責之省，省委之縣，縣推之鄕鎭保甲，可憐全國大多數鄉鎭保甲連紙張筆墨的辦公經費都成了問題，那裏談得上辦敎育！所以上級訓令到時，呈文復去，滿紙計劃·統計·都成了紙上談兵。人民的基本敎育權利被剝奪了，小學生沒有能力閙學潮，學生家長大多數缺乏知識，祇得聽其自生自滅。有些地方小學敎師月入祗有二斗米，無怪敎師成了失業者的暫時棲身之所。人民的基本敎育眞是從那裏說起！</p>
<p>十九世紀以來，敎育是人民的櫂利，已成定論。我國過去的憲法也好，約法也好，都明明規定基本教育是人民的權利，是免費教育。但事實上，大多數人民沒有享受到這種應享受的權利。卽京滬一帶號稱全國政治經濟文化的中心，學生的入學旣困難萬狀，有些地方免費敎育往往又收起費來了。</p>
<p>總之，我國的基本教育無論從「質」或「量」方面說，都已經快到了宣告破產的地步。這是當前國家莫大的隱憂，沒有健全的子代國民，國家從何談建設！值茲遠東區基本敎育會議行將開幕之際，我們要檢討我們自己的基本敎育實况。我們要賓現民主國家人民基本敎育的權利。希望朝野人士把國民敎育當作建國的重心，努力前進。</p>

<h3>印尼致牒聯合國　請調處荷印戰爭　沙利奉命前往各國游說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿二日廣播：聯合國總部今日接獲印尼共和國備忘錄一件，　請聯合國採取適當行動，干涉荷印方面之戰事。同時，總部並接獲荷政府正式備忘錄，聲明此次荷方在印尼採取「警備」行動之原由。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約廿二日電〕阿剌伯國家代表定廿二日與此間印尼聯盟代表最近之印荷糾紛提交安理會之可能性。至於蘇聯是否將有所行動，尙未有何跡象，而英美代表對印尼事件交與聯合國一事，表示冷淡。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教廿一日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃談稱：遠東或將有一國將印尼問題訴諸聯合國安全理事會，可能中國或印度。</p>
<p>〔路透社新加坡廿二日電〕前印尼總理沙利今日自日惹飛抵此間，沙謂係奉索卡諾總統之命，與世界政治領袖討論制止印尼戰爭最佳之方法。明日將啓程赴印度，並將赴倫敦及華盛頓，請英美領袖利用其勢力，制止此一可恥之殖民戰爭。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕此間人士相信：貝文外相今日接見美大使陶格拉斯時，可能談及由英美調處印荷爭端之問題，然料在荷軍甫開始進攻之目前階段，第三者之調處建議，當不致爲荷政府所接受。英外交部之聲明固已透露英國於本月初建議任派一中立之警察委員，以解決印荷間爭執之合組警察隊問題，已遭荷政府拒絕。印尼則深願任何第三者從事調處干涉。</p>
<p>蘇門答臘戰事方酣</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿二日廣播：印尼共和國發表公報稱：瓜哇西海岸砲隊開砲擊中在海岸以前發見之荷蘭戰艦二艘。印尼軍隊刻正在爪哇東部與荷蘭海軍陸戰隊接觸，蘇門答臘印尼陣地若干處遭荷方砲聶，戰事正酣。據　證實消息稱：荷軍已攻佔茂物以南萬隆以西之蘇卡蒲米。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞廿二日電〕荷空軍廿二日空襲爪哇之共和國機塲，炸燬其飛機十架。荷方第一日之目的已達到，共和軍之抵抗較預料薄弱，荷軍之死傷一部份係地雷及埋伏所致。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿二日電〕荷軍今日在爪哇東岸登陸，已與印尼軍發生接戰。荷軍携有坦克車二輛，卡車五輛，登陸後已推進廿哩。登陸前荷海軍曾向海岸砲轟數小時，以「　化」海岸防綫。該處爲爪哇最富庶之區域，盛產糖，茶，咖啡及橡皮。三寳壠前綫印尼軍仍堅守中，且略獲進展，荷機並以火箭砲射擊吉利汶港。</p>
<h3>荷軍以美機作戰　美官司方極表不滿　認爲荷方實已鑄成大錯</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕關於荷蘭在荷印戰事中使用大量美機事，美官方極表痛惜。某高級官員談稱、自大戰結束以來，荷蘭即不曾接得美國之軍械接濟。在太平洋戰爭期間，爲並肩對日作戰起見，美國曾以四十架戰鬥機租借予荷蘭，但並無一架轟炸機。荷蘭如已獲得美國轟炸機，則必得自其他國家，決非得自美國。另據其他方面意見，認爲荷蘭在印尼竟擁有若干美國租借法案之物資，當歸咎於英國。蓋英國於一九四五年十一月底退出印尼時，雖經美國告以切勿將任何軍械移交於荷蘭，但英國竟將租偕法案物資移交荷蘭。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕關於荷蘭向印尼發動全面戰爭一事，傳此間官方人士咸認爲實爲荷蘭所鑄成之大錯。可靠高級方面皆認爲戰爭之結果殆將與越南戰事相同，陷於僵持狀態中，僅能佔領城區，而鄕區則皆在遊擊隊手中云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕國務院今日與駐英荷二國大使通電洽商後，正式宣佈，美國政府對於最近印尼戰事爆發深表遺憾，但仍準備在臨時政府問題獲致協議時進行談判給予印尼經濟援助。</p>

<h3>蘇代表招待記者　談朝鮮問題</h3>
<p>指美違反莫斯科協議</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿一日電〕美蘇聯合委員會蘇聯代表團長希蒂柯夫，今日首次招待美國與朝鮮記者。席間有人向美國代表團長白朗所謂蘇聯代表擬行使否決權，以阻止朝鮮若干公團對於朝鮮設立臨時統一政府事陳述意見一節一，是否確實。希氏答稱，「並無否決權問題。」或問一九四五年莫斯科協定對於組織朝鮮統一政府一條之解釋，似已成僵局，可否由聯合國機構加以解決。希氏答稱，「並無不能打開之僵局存在」。希氏並宣讀長篇書面聲明，指責美國各代表態度，違反莫斯科決議及馬歇爾與莫洛托夫最近協談。希氏稱，美觀代表意　對工商團體，學術機關，與其他非社會團體，甚至虛構的團體，一體向之徵求意見。蘇聯主張先與美蘇雙方均不反對且每單一位有團員一萬人以上之各團體諮詢，但已遭美方拒絕。</p>
<h3>韓北反託管示威　多人被逮捕</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山二十二日廣播：朝鮮委員會主席丁上校（譯音）今日宣稱，六月三十日韓人在蘇聯佔領區平壤等城市攀行反託管示威，爲蘇方殺死四百人，傷二千人，逮捕一萬人。</p>
<h3>美國務院顧問　柯亨辭職　遺缺由鮑倫繼任</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕美國國務院顧間柯亨頃已辭　，從此故總統羅斯福領導下新政之最後代表，遂亦退出美國政府。據消息靈通人士稱：柯亨因未能解決美蘇二國間之困難而引爲失望、遺缺將由鮑倫繼任。鮑氏係蘇聯問題專家，俄語流利，素以贊成美蘇諒解著稱，曾歷任故總統羅斯福與杜魯門總統之通譯。據鮑氏自稱，渠係非共黨之左翼份子云。</p>
<h3>美注意緬甸局勢　希望能和平解決政治問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕國務院發言人頃向本社訪員談稱；緬甸發生政治暗殺案後之局勢，美國現正在密切加以注意中。盎山亦爲遇難中一人，華府人士素視之爲緬甸之未來總理。但緬甸問題乃英國所特別關切者，故美政府不擬將其列爲美外交政策中之問題，惟對於緬甸之和平與秩序則亦爲美人士所特別關心。美政府現希望緬甸能獲致一和平途徑，解決其政治問題，俾可臻於自治之境。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿一日電〕艾德禮首相吿下院稱，緬甸大血案發生後，已請求印度准許於必要時，得在緬甸使用印度軍隊，迄至目前爲止，尙無此等必要狀態發生。當局已採每一步驟，隨時供給需要之增援部隊，緬甸迄尙未爲自治領政府，故英國在緬仍負有維持法律與秩序之責任。</p>
<h3>被捕嫌疑犯　增至三百人</h3>
<p>〔路透社仰光廿一日電〕仰光警察繼續搜捕內閣血案之兇手，表示「確信必能捕獲各兇手」，迄至目前爲止，被捕之嫌疑人犯已有三百餘人。全緬工會領袖十七人，今日以血書呈反法西斯人民自由聯盟執委會，表示準備犧牲其生命，從殲滅暗殺偉大領袖盎山之兇手及奸賊。當被捕之前總理鄔沙在警察嚴密戒備下，押赴仰光中央監獄時，沿途觀衆在呼「打死他」不已。警察對另一前總理巴莫被捕之說，亦拒不證實或否認，巴莫原爲日人治下傀儡總理，戰後即不問政治，惟自盎山於一日間與英國簽訂協定後，即領導反對盎山之人，組織「獨立第一同盟，並譴責四月間之制憲議會選舉，警察昨日授查其寓邸，捕去其婿包揚南。</p>
<h3>分配原子能原料　美接受蘇聯建議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿一日電〕聯合國原子能委員會工作小組委員會今日開會，美國代表奧斯朋宣稱：美國茲爲謀求解決棘手之原子能問題，使彼此意見趨於接近起見，願在原則上接受蘇聯所提設置國際機構以分配原子能一項建議，藉以成立國際條約，規定各國原料數額及核子燃料數量之管制辦法。至此蘇聯所提國際分配之建議，遂已獲多數之擁護。工作小組委員會繼即討論將來所將設置之國際機構應否擁有充工業或軍用之原子燃料製煉廠，或僅須加以管制一項問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿一日電〕聯合國機構今日動態如下：安理會會員籍審查委會表示阿爾巴尼亞及其他八國申請入會，一時均難核准。　濟及社會理事會以十票對一票，美國棄權，核准匈牙利申請加入文化機構。古巴代表提　將匈牙利列入非民主國一類，與西班牙同樣待遇，由蘇聯反對，未　通過。</p>
<h3>美仍擬邀請英國　會商德煤斤增產　英法意見與美國未一致</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿一日電〕美高級官員談稱：美國現正進行一項計州，擬在華盛頓召開提高魯爾區煤斤產量之會議，據稱除非馬歇爾認爲英國將接受　情，馬氏殆不致發出請柬。倫敦來訊可證實此說，　駐英大使陶格拉斯廿一日訪曾貝文外相時，曾强調此一會議之重要性，仍望英國之參加云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫教廿一日電〕關於美國意欲增加德國工業生產，使其水準遠較波茨坦協定新規定者爲高一事，頃據消息靈通人士談稱：英法兩國對此甚爲焦慮，法國政府最近提交英國政府之照會中，對於美國此種意向表示惶恐。聞貝文外相亦曾將英國焦慮之情緒，告知美國駐英大使陶格拉斯。法國駐英大使馬西格里最近與貝文外相會晤時，曾重申法國對於德國工業水準問題之見解云。</p>
<p>法總理重社　美對德態度</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕關於賴瑪迪總理所發表之聲明，謂當盡力取得蘇聯之經濟合作一節，此間半官方面雖表同意，但亦希望法國制定其將來政策，不能僅以預料蘇聯將參加歐洲復興工作爲依據。賴瑪迪總理所稱「門戶仍對蘇聯開放」，以試探蘇聯之是否願意參加一節，實爲就德國問題向美國所作之警吿，此可由法駐美大使龐萊最近之表示覘知之。即英美二國倘採取提高德國工業水準之步驟而朱經法國同意，則法國對馬歇爾計劃之態度，將大受其影響云。</p>
<p>法駐美大使　會晤馬歇爾</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕法國駐美大使龐萊本日與美國國務卿馬歇爾會晤，相與談話，歷四十五分鐘之久，事後向報界談稱：英美法三國可能就有關巴黎經</p>

<h3>希召開團防會議　美軍事代表團長亦參加　克里特島內戰再度爆發</h3>

<h3>哈里曼談話　闡述美對德政策</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕美國商救部長哈里曼，在歐洲考察歷時二星期，甫於最近返國頃在此間舉行記者招待會發表談話稱：在工業方面予德國以優先權之問題，並不存在，此僅爲依照波茨坦協定恢復德國之正常歐洲生活水準問題而已。目前關於德國工業生產水準之談判其目的乃在穩定德境英美佔領區之進出口貿易，美國國務院一如商務部，亦準備竭盡所能，協助實現英美佔領區進出口貿易之平衡。目下　膩之工業生產僅及戰前水準百分之卅八，此在法國及比利時之工業生產則已達戰前水準百分之九十。德國所面臨之主要問題，厥爲煤斤及糧食問題。英美佔領區目下之人口，較戰前多出八百萬名，自東歐輸人糧食之計劃旣吿失敗，英美佔領區人民大半均賴進口之毅以維持生命以　煤斤問題，德國之煤斤生產已大减少，反之，法比兩國之煤斤產量雖不較一九三九年時爲高，至少亦與一九三九年相等。美國希望增加輸往德國之糧食及物資，其目的乃在提高德國之生產。要之、魯爾區之煤斤匪特代表德國之財產，抑且亦爲整個歐洲之財產云。</p>

<h3>十六舖警匪大格鬥　四盜犯兩死兩就擒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕南市十六舖裏馬路五五號至五七號，係雙開間乾興和菸行，昨晚八時二十分左右，該行門已關閉，突有匪徒四名，一人在門外把風，三匪魚貫入內，一着藍卡其長褲，條子府綢襯衫，手提旅行袋一只，一服條子府綢衫褲，另一服長衫，佯稱購物爲由，袖出槍械。此時該行賬房正在揭賬，所有法幣二百餘萬元，置於賬桌，匪徒等正擬肆刧，幸經隣戶等發覺，亟報吿中華路東門路口六三八四號崗警佟啓遠，裏馬路東門路口六三〇三號·六二六八號崗警殷鳳朝·周康年，由佟首先衝到，將門用足踢開，時適一盜擬衝出門外，並云「先生別弄錯，我們是買貨的」。當時該警並未允其出外，而站於　　內之另一盜匪，突出槍錨準開放一槍，佟營側身躱去，幸未中的，一面亦還擊一彈，命中前額，應聲倒地身死。此時穿條府調短衫褲之一匪，乘子彈紛飛時，向樓上逃去，佟警見一匪已被格斃，奮勇追趕，結果該匪遁入二樓小房間，畏罪用手槍自殺。槍膛留有十彈五粒，身畔尚有十粒。同時門口一匪，正竄至同路楊松記地貨行，而後面六三〇三號，六二六八號兩崗警，據報馳夾，卒將該盜擒獲，斯時邑廟警分局副分局長陳景珊，亦已聞報親率股長周南，巡官謝萬孚，警長崔金川，警員錢蕪敏，李嘉福等，會同義　等乘車趕到。尚有在門外把風之一匪，（名葉海籌，廿四歲，溫州人）見事敗露逃至十六舖外灘市渡輪附近後，被水上警局警士截獲，移送邑廟警局併案究辦。經周股長等在事主家檢獲匪徒手槍三支，子彈數十粒。兩匪屍體，後用車送入警察醫院轉舁騐屍所勘騐，是役所有匪徒四口，兩死兩就擒，可謂天網恢恢，疏而不漏者矣。</p>

<h3>天主教會土地權利　登記問題暫緩辦理　正由外部徵集資料研究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕天主敎會在本市購置地產甚多，該會負責人范爾典前持證件至地政局辦理登記，地政局因天主敎會性質與英美其他敎會不同，天主敎會爲世界組織，屬羅馬敎廷管轄，各國承認其爲國際社會一員、與我國互派使節，但並未訂有條約可取得土地權利，又不能視爲中國教會，故地政局不能予以土地所有權登記，一面請示行政院如何處置。昨行政院已有指令到滬，聲稱關於擬訂天主敎會管理辦法，正由外交部徵集資料，並會同各機關研究辦理中，在該辦法未擬訂核准以前，上海天主敎會土地權利登記問題，應暫緩辦理。</p>
<h3>美西太平洋艦隊司令　柯克上將昨抵滬　定今晨飛京晤魏德邁</h3>

<h3>高空發光體　並非氣球　依舊是謎</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市發現飛盤之說，迄今仍爲一謎。日前有江灣無綫電台報務員范家康君致函本報，證明渠於十九日晚間目賭之發光物體實爲美軍氣象台所發之測候氣球。但在十八日深夜，有外僑亦發現爲飛、盤之物，經査該日美軍氣象台並無氣球升放，然則此放光體究係何物，實難以解釋。記者昨與中央氣象台鄭子政台長談及，渠認爲有三種可能：一爲測候氣球，此物美軍氣象台常有升放。二爲隕星之類，夏令夜間常可看到。三爲一種在試騐中之秘密武器。惟可能性自以前兩者爲大。除此之外，或有若干喜歡凑熱閙者故意揑造目賭飛盤之說，當亦不乏其人也。</p>
<h3>中航平滬客機　零件損壞留靑　專機派往　接客來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中航公司XTT八一號平滬班機，前日由平飛滬，途經靑島時，發覺機內某種零件損壞，必須更換，該機遂留靑停飛，所有乘客由公司照料在靑過夜。昨日該公司特派專機一架，自滬運送零件前往並接飛乘客來滬。據公司發言人談：因目前外匯關係，材料補給困難，各項零件不能充份購進，亦不能於沿綫各站一律配備，放發生此種情形時，須另派一機前往接替，財務方面損失甚多，乘客亦極感不便，由此可見我國民航事業在目前物力維艱下，發展頗爲困難云。</p>
<h3>新麥已登塲　貸欵猶未准　麵粉工業緊急會議　推代表作最後呼籲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第四區麵粉工業同業公會，於兩個月前曾向糧食部四聯總處申請三千億原麥貸款，藉以充實製粉原料，增裕民食緩和糧食恐慌。該項申請雖疊經報載業已提出討論並有核准之說，然該會迄未接獲主管當局任何明令。茲以新麥業已登塲，設主管當局仍由普通公文輾轉傳送，恐即加核准亦將蹈去年三百億原麥貸款之覆轍，失去時機，無所裨益。該會爰於昨日開緊急會議當塲推定楊管北，席德柄，榮毅仁，錢鍾漢，洪其琛，任卓羣，王仲嘉，駱仲鳳等代表，於今日向四聯總處作最後呼籲，早日決定是否貸放，俾可配合政府總動員國策，加强民食生產。否則新麥因蘇浙皖三省各廠資金短　不克收購，致向他區流去，民食即感恐慌，配給無從繼續，且恐慌一經形成，事後即不易補救·</p>
<h3>「西瓜要西瓜」！　今年雨多西瓜質量頗受影響　全滬營業總數可達五百億元</h3>
<p>塘棲瓜著稱一時　平湖瓜繼起於後</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕解暑妙品除冰淇淋，汽水之類人造飲料外，我們一定還忘不了西瓜，今年雨量較多，影響西瓜的質和量很大，然而天氣如此炎熱，它的消耗量依然與日俱增，不多幾天前，塘棲瓜還祇有五萬元一担，昨天已漲到十四萬元了，而且還是求過於供。十六舖與老閘橋南北兩水菓市塲，專營西瓜的地貨行共約一百多家，預計今年每家平均營業數字約五億元，合計約五百億元，假使以十四萬元一担計算，則本市西瓜的消耗量爲三十五萬担，每担平均十二隻，總共四百廿萬隻，本市人口四百二餘萬，那末每個人在一個夏季中，平均可以吃到一隻西瓜。</p>
<p>西瓜的湧潮，還有一個星期，那時候每天可到三四十萬隻，今年的產地收成雖然不豐，可是種植的面積，比去年增多了一倍，所以總產量沒有減少。</p>
<p>選擇西瓜的優劣，誰都知道用指頭彈上二記，然而更重要的在皮色，尤其底皮的黃色濃淡，明顯的吿訴你這個西瓜的年齡，當然越老越成熟的最甜。一位西瓜業的老前輩吿訴記者稱：西瓜的種植地不宜年代過久，從未種植西瓜之生地，第一年種瓜所產必佳。在四十多年前，塘棲小林的三白瓜，曾著稱一時，其後平湖聖塘，戴家浜所產相繼稱雄，尤以戴家浜瓜脆而甜，能以手指劃破之。目前以平湖南門三白瓜被推爲上品，其肉黃而鬆，這幾天已有貨到。可惜不多，南門瓜在近幾年來，亦已逐漸變質，西瓜皇座勢將轉移，不知後繼者何也。</p>

<p>本市營業人力車改裝之單人後座三輪車第一五〇〇〇號後之磁牌，前以不及趕製，由公用局先行核發行車執照，並加蓋「磁牌未發暫准通告「戳記以憑營業，茲聞該項磁牌現已製妥，自即日起可憑行車執照及車主原印鑑向各領照之原車輛登記所具領。車亦未交付，該陳文治張濂生二人謊言車照過戶需時，須今年舊歷正月初十左右捐出，車須同時交付，又要求張參議員變通辦理先付貨款，張當予以拒絕。後陳文治又向張懇求，云年關需款甚急，由伊掉票六百萬元，並由伊友人宋良銳出面說情，張始允掉票。不料時光迅速，該二人一再藉詞延宕，至本年國歷三月間始將車交付，而車照仍未過戶捐出，淮言明一星期內捐好車照。屆時又復託詞稽延。直至上月間，張參議員始發覺車上之舊車照，係屬冒用他車，即能過戶，亦屬非法，當向陳張二人交涉，詎知陳張二人從此避不見面，張參議員始知受騙，且乘坐無照之車，知係違法，迫不得已將原車述同冒用他車之車照呈送老閘警察局究辦。適在老閘警局秉公偵査期間，該陳文治張濂生二人忽向地方法院檢察處控訴張參議員凟職，云要挾需索損失費三千萬元。昨開調査庭，張參議員當庭否認並無三千萬元之需索情事，當經郁檢察官宣吿「飭回」。至某晚報所載「被吿交保」，並非事實</p>

<h3>經濟部定期召開　全國煤斤增產會議</h3>
<p>配合動員令加強煤斤秋制</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部爲配合總動員令，加强全國煤斤管制起見，已定於八月一日，召開全國煤斤增產會議，現全國各大煤礦公司負責人，均陸續報到中。據關係方面息：此次增產計劃，在華北方面，如開灤及東北各煤區域、除一方面計劃增產外，一方面仍應從保路保礦入手，俾增產煤斤，能源源供應全國各地消費。同時，計劃劃黃河以南，應達成維持自給自足之目標。以防在華北供應萬一中斷時·南方用煤，仍母虞匱乏。南方各礎藏增產計劃，主要將集中義洛，華東，淮南，湘潭及台灣等地。義洛煤礦之增產，刻正由資源委員會竭力籌劃中，預計每日可產二千噸。該區產煤，可供隴海路以西各區消費，華東煤礦，目前日產約一千二百噸，茲望積極開發新煤田，則該礦煤斤，仍可望源源供應津浦及隴海兩路沿綫之消費。淮南煤礦，目前日產約二千三百噸，照預定增產計劃，本年底可日產三千噸以上，明年底時可日產五千噸。該礦增產成功　則對南京區及錫常工業，更可望充份供應。湘煤增產重心，在湘潭附近，現亦正由資委會籌劃中。該地煤斤增產成功，則對湘鄂兩省所需之煤斤可望充份供應。台灣增產計劃，近方洽商中，台省自稱年可增產一百萬噸，惟技術問題，仍有待進一步之籌劃云。</p>
<h3>各地煤斤源源裝到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部上海區燃管會，近月來自各地裝到煤斤情形，漸見好轉。六月份在各地裝到煤斤共達十五萬噸，本月份預計自秦皇島可裝到十二萬噸，台灣可到五萬噸，又各煤商自由採購者，亦可達六七千噸。又中信局向加拿大訂購之烟煤，最近亦可到達三萬噸。到煤充沛後，該會緊急用煤之存底，亦可望陸續遞補充實云。</p>
<h3>連跌之後空方紛補　化趨勢已轉好</h3>
<p>華股昨起反動，連跌之後，空方紛補，中途仍無新買參加。信和慘跌多日，昨日顯有維持，頗爲堅定。小型股除新華獨跌一成外，餘者若新光景福亦在軋空情勢中趨俏，大勢已吿改觀，或可蹔獲小蘇。晨開時即交股均穩，遞交股則升降均見，遞美亞以四七七元開後，八九號二三號二二四號一九號一四號一三三號二二六號六〇號二三一號一入〇號一五二號六九號等來進，現美亞升至四九八元，遞美亞漲到五〇六元。一五七號一四二號七六號二三五號一七七號脫手，九時半後，步低至四八八元。此後一五二號一五四號二二四號一〇四號趁低吸收，一五七號二二三號則出，而起盤旋，徘徊至十時二十分，二二四號一九號一五三號七八號六一號買胃見殷，遞美亞升至五一〇元，現美亞達五〇三元。三二號一四二號八五號二二三號進遞信和，亦回好到三一七〇元。二三一號七三號一四〇號九四號五二號六九號二三二號一〇四號一三二號紛紛賣出，二二三號並力售現美亞，近午曾將美亞迫低於四八〇元以下，遞信和由一三一號一六〇號等賣到三〇〇〇元關邊，新光自一八〇元低至一七〇元內，景福由一五四元降至一四六元。嗣後一八〇號七六號一一二號七〇號二二四號來進，二二三號忽來追補，遞美亞臨收時迫五〇〇元關，遞信和由一六九號八四號二〇七號四五號進至三一二〇元，新光景福亦以高價結束。收後遞美亞有二三七號等吸納升高至五〇三元左右。結果較前收即交股計景福獨漲一成弱，新光美亞信和華豐各漲半成，新華慘降一成弱，中法永公勤興雖升而不多，國貨亦然，內衣新亞水泥景綸大通尚平，統益中絲火柴各升半成，　要中紡則漲一成。遞交各股計新光景福信和華豐各漲半成强，美亞永公祗吿微升。塲外各老股計華商微升外，餘均見疲。</p>
<p>永紗場外喊價初開一八二元至一八五元，高價一九三元至一九六元，低價一七入元至一八一元，而以一九〇元及一九三元之價收市。息價一角六分半至二角一</p>
<h3>統債平定　外股呆滯</h3>
<p>公價昨十分平定，統丙起仆甚狹，開價六七〇〇元，自六六〇〇元升至六九○〇元，臨收爲六八〇〇元。三六〇室五〇三室賣出，五五五室五五二室則進，結果較前收計甲乙丙戊各升一〇〇元，統丁回上二〇〇元，成交一百萬左右。</p>
<p>外股昨呆滯萬分，極難獲得成交，十分閑散。怡紗自六六〇〇〇元開後升至六六五〇〇元左右收市。起仆之狹，爲歷來所罕見。散戶雖買，合盛測出，結果較前收計業廣微挫餘均微升。</p>
<h3>同盟勝利公債　有人暗中收買</h3>
<p>際此美公債及美金短期庫劵滯銷之時，日來本市方面若干有資力之公司行號及個人，正在暗中搜購抗戰時期在重慶發行之同盟勝利美金公債。査同盟勝利美金公債之抽籤還本及付息，原定均以美金支付，勝利後政府爲管制及　節外匯，曾明令改以法幣按照美金牌價支付。最近謠傳有關方面爲恢復債信計，對外籍持券人之在國外者，即以美金支付，對國人則仍以法幣支付。因此若干投機者即在市上暗中收買債劵，携往國外，委託外人出面，要求我國政府以美金償付本息。此種逃避資本及巧取外匯之新花樣，殊甚主意。</p>
<h3>全國棉花存量</h3>
<p>一百十四萬二千市擔</p>
<p>據悉農林部棉產改進諮詢委員會，及機器棉紡織業同業公會聯合會，因鑒於全國棉花存量之多寡，足以影響棉市之價價格，與棉紗原料之調節，具有密切之關係。該會等爰於本年三月初，進行全國鄕間有棉調査。因目今烽火遍野，交通常發生阻隔，估計爲難。該會等雖動員四百餘人，從事工作，表面似爲簡單，實極複雜。迄至本年六月二十日以前估計，其間如山東·河北·蘇北·豫北之一部份棉區，以情形特殊，所得數字，極不完全。山西·四川·遼寗三省數字，至今未到，均付缺如。記者茲就該會等已得數字，錄誌如下：河北省存棉數量二一一九〇〇〇市擔，山東省存棉數量一四三〇〇〇市擔，河南省存棉一二〇〇〇〇市擔，陝西省存棉一五〇〇〇〇市擔，湖北省存棉二五八〇〇〇市檐，湖南省存棉二二〇〇〇市擔，江西省存棉五〇〇〇市擔，安徽省存棉二四〇〇〇市擔，江蘇省存棉一六九市擔，浙江省存棉二二〇〇〇市擔、合計存棉數量一一四二〇〇○市擔。</p>
<h3>國行貼放會　十七次例會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼　委員會第十七次例會，於昨日下午三時，在該會會址舉行，到秦潤卿，伍克家等十一人，討論審査各工業貸款申請案件，結果通過二十六件，核准貸款金額二十六億七千萬元。</p>
<h3>代理磨製麥粉　已收麥五萬餘担</h3>
<p>本市福新阜豐等代理政府磨製麵粉，業由中農銀行撥到資金一千三百億元，茲據五廠合組之公記辦事處負責人吿稱，該處於上週開始辦公後，即在滬收購原料，準備大量生產。昨日爲止，已收有小麥五萬餘担。該處第一步擬在上海無錫兩地，先行收麥，然後將擴充至南京蕪湖蘇北揚州泰州等地收購。預計每日將收麥二百萬担，以便每月製粉三百萬包。又各　已開始代磨生產，惟尚未全部復工，一俟各地小麥採　來滬，可經常維持足量原料時，各廠每月可產粉十一萬四千句，將達到戰前生產水準云。</p>
<h3>捲菸市況閑散</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，以各方進意閑散，吸納不一。市上以十支大英烟添辦尚股，價亦堅穩，結果爲八百七十六萬元，比上日跌九萬元。老刀烟走勢較滯，價挫二十三萬元，爲七百三十二萬元。五華哈德門市亦不振。華商烟美麗百萬金白蘭地雙斧等條烟均見下挫，惟然銷貨挺升四五百元。聽經烟船上來貨甚多，去化淸淡，五十支茄力克低至五萬二千五百元，軋跌二千五百元。三五牌猛挫四千元之巨，為四萬二千元，美貨堅疲互見。</p>
<h3>外銷冰蛋　中信局繼續收購</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國外銷冰蛋，曾由中央信託局，於本年五月間，與英簽訂合約，成交一批計五千噸。迄目前爲止，該局已與國內冰蛋商成交三千二百五十噸。內有二千四百六十噸，業已陸續運英。現該局尚在繼續收購中，收購價格，由輸出推廣會決定。聞與英成交價格，每噸價在英鎊二百鎊左右云。</p>
<h3>中信局射與麥帥總部妥　裝運食糖赴日銷售</h3>
<p>本年總額為二萬五千公噸</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中央信託局爲拓展海外貿易，前經向資源委員會所屬合灣糖業公司洽商，積極推動食糖外銷事宜，以爭取外匯。幷鑒于日本對食糖每年消耗數量頗多，國去即取給於台灣者，戰後對食糖需要殊殷。美國素以產糖著名，因受政府限制，亦未能對其有充分供應。中信局有鑒於此，前曾遴選要員，赴日與麥帥總部接洽，茲已獲有結果，核准於本年對日輸出食糖總額爲二萬五千公噸。以年底爲交淸期限，售價每磅一角五分美元，每公噸約值三百餘美元，總值約計一千五百餘萬美元，並規定以「中砂」爲限。茲悉，日內該局即可與台糖公局正式簽約，如船隻無問題，本月底即有第一批食糖約五千噸輸日。又悉：台省今歲甘蔗豐收，預計本年內可產食糖卅萬噸，明年產量爲四十萬噸，再明年至卅八年，植糖面積可擴展至十一萬八千甲（每甲合十六畝）。所需肥料八萬公噸，現向國內外設法洽購，最近已向蘇聯定購硫酸亞二萬五千公噸，不日即可分批運台施用。據最近該公司在台舉行本年度蔗糖事業討論會之決定，將前訂蔗農與公可分糖比率，農民爲百分之四十八，公司爲百分之五十，現改爲一律五十比五十，農民得此鼓勵，對甘蔗生產更饒有興趣云。</p>
<h3>台糖下跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市以業中銀根較緊者，大都傾向售出，台糖遂致下跌三·四·五·萬元不一。公會劃盤如二四粗白爲六十四五萬元，次六十一萬元，二〇中砂白初爲五十三萬元，後爲五十一萬五千元，四半車白六十一萬元。土糖成交仍少，趨勢尚平。汕提靑四十四萬五千元至四十三萬七千元，興化白袋莊高貨五十八九萬元，簍莊次白五十萬元，興赤四十四萬元至四十二萬元，刁靑油包卅七萬元，共開出二百餘件。</p>
<h3>洋莊茶穩俏</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊本市，午昌茶葉公司對於低擋陳紅茶，續與貨方磋商，形勢遂仍不衰。他若非洲　洛哥所需之抽珍珍眉等綠茶，則以貨方力圖堅售，情况依然賢多於賣，成交數量，咸僅零星，而市氣益趨穩俏。至於內銷花色，本街店莊及京杭各路去化猶有，以言趨勢，在此種情形下，經過活潑狀態，多與隔日相仿。</p>
<h3>紗花布一致疲弱</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，塲內人心仍軟，各方需求平庸，客帮實銷亦懈，市勢疲　乏神。四二支藍鳳收價爲一千七百二十萬元，跌進眼價，比之上日續跌四十萬元。二十支時變馬爲一千一百五十萬，輕雙馬一千零五十萬，均跌二十萬元。其餘四二支賓光水月，四十支金城，三十二支藍鳳，及廿支藍鳳紅蜂筒子，十六支光明等粗細紗，一致賡續下挫二十萬至四十萬元不一。</p>
<p>花</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况仍疲，買戶以棉紗再挫，人心軟弱，紗廠雖有吸胃，惟乘疲抑價，致賣戶不　脫手，交易反趨沉寂，市况呆定。靈寶花最高做開二二五萬，最低爲二一二萬。此貨因合紡二十支以上細紗，近日　紗實銷清淡，跌風較粗紗爲厲，故價亦帶小，沙市做開二一八萬，涇陽二二〇萬，該貨因合紡二十支及十六支熱門紗關係，價格疲中獨挺，故連日高檔棉脚地甚軟，普通檔頭趨勢反挺。各檔傲開送廠價計靈寶二一五萬，歸德二一六萬。又棧交價靈寶二一二萬，二二〇萬，二二五萬，冲沙二一八萬，涇陽二二〇萬，况紗市一九六萬，歸德一九七萬五千，火機一七三萬，一七七萬，周浦籽花每擔三一萬五千。</p>
<p>布</p>
<p>棉布晨開時，業中人因欠息過高，均有吐售之意。廣帮仍在逢高脫手，十二磅龍頭細布一度低至布四十二萬八千元，旋以紡建售掛價較高，致塲中人心轉挺，龍頭細布收價回昂至四十三萬二千元，但比上日仍跌四千元。五福彩球藍鷄等細布，亦續挫七八千至　元許，四　子金印元　灣及鈀布，漢口　略進，市裏堅　。其餘瀑布粗布及藍布士林布等，互有升降云。</p>
<h3>新鈔二百餘箱　已由英輪運滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）新紙幣又有到滬，太古監烟囪經理之薩披登號、上星期六由利物淸到滬，除運來大批五金雜貨外又有紙幣二百二十箱，船　公和祥碼頭，該紙幣業由中央銀行提取。</p>
<h3>呢絨夏貨落令</h3>
<p>派力司凡立丁羽紗呢螺四呢胖別取巴勒呢白嘰嘰白直貢紗蔴膠布白帆布百福呢香港羅等諸夏令貨品，市銷茲已落令，本客各帮俱多衹出不進，茶會上趨勢，因此均見疲滯，行情無不縮跌。其定貨後交者，均乏利可圖，甚至計算二角拆息而虧本者亦有之。秋冬需銷之花呢大衣呢等，市氣則頗緊俏，因不久實銷即可發動也。</p>
<h3>人絲同業開會</h3>
<p>討論訂購人造絲問題</p>
<p>人造絲同業公會，於昨日下午二時，在慈淑大樓六樓該會會址舉行全體大會。該會一百另數家新老會員均參加。討論之主要事務爲當局新近核定之六十餘萬外匯限額，供人絲業訂購人絲之用。其中人造絲號同業申請得五萬餘元，該項頭寸如何分配案，其次則爲新會員之人會問題，及權利與義務云。</p>

<p>四聯總處上海區巡迴稽核國，已於廿一日正式成立，昨日已就四聯分處正式開始工作，準備各種資料，日內即分八組出發，分赴各貸款廠商査核其貸款之用途，生產之成效等要點，該團兼主任刁民仁，副主任蔣劍農，襲强，昨晨對於技術問題，復有指示</p>
<h3>新茶陸續到滬　農行分批押欵</h3>
<p>本年度新茶，各茶商精製後，業已裝箱運滬。中國農民銀行遵照四聯總處核定價格，舉辦押款’（一）祁紅每擔作價六十萬元，屯綠五十萬元，平綠四十萬，寗紅四十萬，溫綠閩紅兩湖及其他各種紅綠茶每擔均作價三十萬元，（二）押款時間，茶貸箱茶爲兩個月，自製箱茶三個月。（三）利息三分，現祁紅溫綠·平綠·屯綠·已先後運到五千餘擔，尚有一萬擔，已在途中，其餘亦分批陸續啓運，預計可達十餘萬箱。</p>
<h3>非進口貨外滙申請　由國行審核會核辦</h3>
<p>據國行發表消息稱、査非進口貨外匯申請審核委員會。爲便於處理申請案件起見，經商准市央銀行業務局，核發第一〇四號通函，規定各指定銀行外埠分行應將所收受關於行政院核准範圍以內之非進口貨外匯申請書，一律寄由各該滬行彙送中央銀行非進口貨外匯申請審核委員會核辦。</p>
<h3>圓肉跌一成許</h3>
<p>上檔大片圓肉近來到銷均稀，但以新枝干正值低廉之際，未能獨具穩勢。昨市略有開出，計跌去一成許。</p>
<h3>米市由疲轉定　油價升沉不一</h3>
<p>昨日南北市共到米糧五千零六十餘石，市勢晨開依然懈淡，午時店方乘巧訥取，疲而轉定。結果粳秈米無甚榮辱，北市去化略活，微微帶挺。白元陰元高定次呆，麵粉實消閒散，廠粉回跌一二千元，雜牌粉統粉下挫二三千元，麩皮冒呆少少神，修削三五百元。</p>
<p>豆餅鄕村購買力不强，暑斯正值銷令而交易不旺，仍居平庸，僅營口餅略加一二千元。黃豆消化冷淡，續低二三千元，赤豆步削三五千元，彔豆高料去化亦然見淡，形趨平正，中次乏交，再跌萬元。紅糧挺秀，見升一二千元。生仁廣方洋莊納胃接續，挺進三五千至萬元。芝蔴成交稀寥趨勢暫穩，苞米供求平衡，價無變化。蠺豆去路仍呆，再跌三五千元。莞豆站平，小麥廠方成交尚可，高貨定局，中次回疲千元。油市形勢盤旋之局，生油先疲後俏，軋升三五千元，豆油立定，淸油回低三五千元、菜油亦削三五千元，熟英油消化不振，下挫萬餘元，蔴油乍升乍降，甚難捉摸，今因到多消呆，狂跌三四萬元。</p>

<h3>魏德邁東來途中　訪韓國臨時政府駐華代表團長濮純</h3>
<p>— 本報訊者德玠</p>
<p>南京廿一日快訊</p>
<p>剛剛病癒不久的濮純先生，年齡與積勞在他淸　的面龐上刻劃出舊鬥的紀錄，說話的聲調與語氣充分表示出一個革命者的堅決。五十歲以上的韓國人，亡國的仇恨從小生了根，半生流浪生活使復國之心變得更切，他的談話里沒有一句外交辭令。</p>
<p>「我們韓國對蘇聯的政策的看法是不用說了，對美國的也不能滿意。韓國的善良人民一致反對這種把弱者犧牲在列强矛盾之間的現狀，美國應該儘快改變這種遠東綏靖政策。』</p>
<p>韓國情況　恐怖災難交迫</p>
<p>「從勝利到現在，快兩年了，我們韓國的情况是一天壞似一天。北方不用說了，從延安和西伯利亞過去的韓國共產黨，是蘇聯唯一允許活動的政黨，他們的作風是和中國共產黨一脈相傳的，鬥爭，破壞，武力無限制的膨脹，造成了無限制的恐怖與災難。文敎停廢，工商破毀，被日本擠榨了五十年後僅餘的一點民生憑藉，也都蕩然無存了。這情形影響到了南方，難民羣集，綱紀廢弛，社會不安，百業也頗見凋敝。</p>
<p>「南方是黨派可以公開活動的區域，但是多年犧牲奮門領導革命的團體與個人並沒受到應得的重視。在美國軍政府治理之下抬頭的，是買辦階級和飯店老　，仗着他們會幾句洋涇浜英語，上承美軍意旨，假人威風，魚肉同胞。老百姓和從前差不多一樣苦，韓國的『解放』，祗好傻從屬於一個主人，變成了分屬兩個主人。」</p>
<p>南方韓共　不公平的民主</p>
<p>「南方的韓共活耀嗎？」　「啊！很活躍。其他黨派不能在蘇軍區活動存在，韓共却仍可以在南方爲所欲爲。這就是美國的民主作風，韓共在南方破壞也好，暴動也好，受法律刑罰的只有下層行動的人，首腦份子照樣可以得到各種保障與方便。這種不公平的民主，使南方人民起着英名的憤慨。</p>
<p>「說到聯合政府，目前是沒甚麽希望了。但是幸虧沒了希望，不然，當聯合政府組成功後，蘇聯必完全建議美國一同撤兵，那時北方三十萬武裝韓共會把韓國造成一個甚麽局面，任誰都可以毫不猶預的料想到。南方沒有人在準備內戰，北方確早有了武力打天下的企圖，所以，在美蘇之間和平沒有澈底獲得前，侈談聯合政府是等於開門揖盜。我們韓國的期望是在獨立後對遠東和平有所貢獻，沒想到如今獨立之期旣遠，和平更是無望，韓國如被韓共以武力　括，遠東將水無寗日。」</p>
<p>維持均勢</p>
<p>小國大受犧牲</p>
<p>他對霍奇將軍沒甚麽批評，祗說他是史迪威推荐的。他很遺憾西方人了解東方人如是之少，尤其是美國大對韓國了解的更少。他苛責美蘇的政策：</p>
<p>「美蘇間的矛盾與衝突，是他們本身的思想和制度造成的，但是他們不從自身求改善，想出方法來解決，却在小國與弱國身上剜肉補瘡。東歐的小國一個跟着一個被犧牲了，中國的局防也弄得不尷不尬；說到我們韓國，開羅會議給我們獨立的保證，莫斯科三外長窗議又給了個四國託管五年的處分。這種決定毫無歷史的根據，完全爲了維特他們勢力均衡的現狀，就把韓國給犧牲了。我們有過三千年的獨立歷史，有絕對自主的能力與資格，過去我們爲反抗併吞滅亡而革命，今後我們對共管仍不能接受，我們不是戰收國，我們是被解放的，在對日作戰中我們也流了血。」</p>
<p>他認爲美國在遠東的政策太軟弱：</p>
<p>「我們希望魏　邁將相能在韓國作充分的事實調査，使美國的政策變得積極些，才會眞有益於遠東以至世界的和平。」</p>
<p>復國情殷　將遞交備忘錄</p>
<p>濮純先生是韓國臨時政府駐華代表團團長，他的談話中沒有一點保留，韓國人民的血淚交織成復國的熱切期望，他們攻擊任何阻碍的勢力與不合理的措施、當魏德邁將軍抵京後，他們將遞給他一個包括廣泛內容的備忘錄</p>
<p>權威人士說，魏德邁的任務對中國和韓國是同等重要的。因爲在韓國美軍和蘇軍相互守望在一條綫上，這條綫已被作成兩個思想和制度的分野，甚至兩大衝突矛盾的最前綫。濮純先生說如果韓國問題解決了，至少東北的局勢可因韓共之去而簡單不少，事實上中國問題的焦點早已移到了東北。北緯三十八度不但關係着韓國的命運，也是中國的和平，世界的安定之所繫。</p>
<h3>香港夏景</h3>

<h3>香港人在熱浪裏</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者子健</p>
<p>十七日香港航訊</p>
<p>香港人避署，他們不會上廬山或莫干山；有資格談避署的人，他們在香港的太平山上或半山區，或在市區外風景幽美的海角灣頭，早已築有精舍或別業。當熱浪來襲時，便整家搬過那裏去。夏天是香港人的一個享樂季節。在山嶺海角設有別業的人，甚至一般的薪水階級，他們也三五成隊跑到海濱的公共冰塲去，浸個凉快。游冰在香港，倒算一個大衆化的娛樂，牠和冬季的足球，都是香港特殊的產兒。所以，香港人的游泳和足球技術，也比國內較爲出色。</p>
<p>太平山上或半山區的住戶，不是普通人家；他們至少是「有車階級」，尤其半山區，纜車和公共汽車，都隔離得很遠很遠，出入非有車不可。戰前，中國人是禁止在太平山頂結應的，戰後這條禁例宣佈取銷，山頂區的住客，也不限於碧跟兒。但到了現在爲止，我們的同胞似乎沒有洋人那麽喜歡幽靜，山頂的人家還找不出多少是黃臉的！</p>
<p>香港的山頂區是英人百年來在那個荒島上唯上獲力的經營，我說這句話，因為那裏過去是一個純粹的英人往宅區，他們的經營不論大小，都是爲了自己的亨受而努力。所以，雖在深山重岩之間，水電供給，固不成問題，抑馬路縱橫其間，交互聯絡，極爲便利。環繞山頂，馬路和電力纜車的修築，確是一個規範鉅大而置用的建設，即在遠東，亦負盛名，遠方遊客慕名的來觀光的，大不乏人。但太平洋戰起，山頂區的洋房，給日軍砲兵打垮的很多，環繞山頂馬路亦見彈痕纍纍，創瘐滿目，（也有不少洋房給歹徒拆去木料，只剩一國鋼骨水泥的空架子）。戰前入晚如珠環繞山頂區的路燈，到了現在還未修復。</p>
<p>山頂區拔海一千三百英尺以上。山平山峯高一千七百英尺，峯腰蓋有一個大兵營。登山頂區下望，則整個市區盡入眼底，九龍半岛亦遙遙相對。山後則見水天連接，白雲碧海，令人意遠。山頂區春季多霧，夏日全無著氣。海風陣陣吹來，尤爲其他避暑區所不常有者。</p>
<p>香港四面皆水，天然的海浴塲很多。最有名的要算淺水灣浴塲，而沙灘最美的則是石澳浴塲。夕陽西下，那些浴塲裏充滿了男女。他們下水的固多，但專來納凉看熱鬧的也不少。後者是「沙灘大會」的分子。淺水灣在香港市區的背後，汽車車程約三十分鐘，車費和帳幕費，每次，每人至少花費五元，這個數目約等於一般受薪階級半天的收入。所以他們儘有能力每週到那裏嬉遊一兩回。這是一個風氣朋友見面便問道：「最近可到什麽地點遊泳去？」姑勿論香港的市塲如何不景、廣東的水災如何嚴重，姑勿論是有軍階級或無車階級，在這個熱天，香港人總找機會浸在深綠的海被裏，吸進一口最淸凉的空氣，因爲那是一個他們得天獨厚的一個享樂季節。</p>

<h3>茁長中的湘桂黔鐵路</h3>
<p>— 本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>梧州十七日航訊</p>
<p>戰爭給予人民只有無比的慘酷，一九四四湘桂黔空前的血戰，幾乎掃蕩盡兩千公里土地上一切微弱的生命，這一幕空前浩刧，從衡陽保簡戰開始，繼之全部展開在湘桂·黔桂兩鐵路綫上，當時的流亡奔號，呼兒喚女，嚎天頓地的慘象，不知多少人還能够歷歷訴說，也就在這一次大刦裏，兩道通注西南以生命力的大血管——，湘桂·黔桂鐵路，便在漫天的砲火鐵蹄下，迅息枯萎，至於死亡。可是，人民的有生力量永遠消滅不去，從敵騎潰退，以至戰爭勝利，度過了一塲漫天的風雪，千里長能又在人民的手裏復甤，成長，而且成長得更茁壯，更堅强。</p>
<p>湘桂黔鐵路合併，只是卅四年底，敵寇求降以後的事，湘桂鐵路的興築，遠在抗戰軍興之際，到了卅二年而全綫吿成，自衡陽至桂省來賓，全長六百二十餘公里，築路初意原在經柳州過邕寗出龍州而抵桂越邊境，以期獲得盟國的物資接濟，所以軍事價值高於任何鐵路，可惜不逾年面越南已爲敵寇進佔，桂南戰事隨起，於是自柳州至邊界的舖軌工程遂作罷論。當局爲謀滇緬國際路綫暢通，於是便在廿八年七月興築黔桂鐵路以代轉輸物資之責，自柳州至都匀全長四百六十公里，正計劃貫通都筑工段而洲柱戰起，敵騎沿路乘虛直薄筑垣，桂境亦幾大部陷敵，全綫被毀無遺，連路基都挖得七零八落，待到十一月間，敵寇開始敗退，次年新正，交通部始謀復軌工作，同時派袁夢鴻爲黔桂路局長，直到九月，敵寇投降，當局爲加强復員工作，迅速修復黔桂·湘桂兩路事功，即於十二月合併兩路，改稱爲湘桂黔鐵路，仍以袁夢鴻任工程局長，改組以後，即積極籌劃全綫復軌工作，當時全國失地光復，東南及中原鐵路待搶修者極多，而且更有一部人士認爲兩路沒有甚麼重大經濟價值，所以一再躭擱，其中似乎還有不少不甚愉快的事情，然而，路總不能够不要，便由交部撥過工款七十餘億元，預期兩年修竣，然而一年多來，才修到一半，已經用大槪還非得重重下一注錢，不易講得，光是各式機車，便要近二百個，貸車客車也要三千輛，現在修拼來用的機頭，不過卅多個，從此即可想見費用之大，然而，當局開發西北·西南之聲揭藥入雲之際，又不得不使我們相信政府用兵之餘，必定還顧及建設。</p>
<p>湘桂黔鐵路從復軌工程以至部分通車的過程中，其中多少艱難困苦，一下聽來，彷彿這一條道路的復活，簡直是交通史中的一幕奇蹟，而鐵路員工能够在萬分困難之下，以人力克服物力的缺乏，短短的一年多期間，修復通車軌程近五百公里，軌車近四十台，客貨車達七十輛，並能迅速復建各項房屋機廠等設備。這不能不使人欽敬於勞　英雄的胼手胝足的辛勤，員司的埋頭苦幹精神，和局長袁夢鴻先生的卓絕領導，現在讓我們看一看一些「人怎樣變成巨人」的收事，一定會深深感覺到建設是一件怎樣艱難而可貴的工作，從而勸諌那些一個地雷？　的一聲便斷送了，一次人民血汗的「英雄」們，也應及時而止了。</p>
<p>湘柱黔路全長一千一百餘公里，除了桂衝段東安以東一小段在湖南境，九十公里在廣東外，其餘大部分在桂黔境內，而且可以說大部在廣西省內，然而桂黔兩地的地理環境和人文狀况，早已「地無三里平人無三分銀」著稱，尤其是鐵路所經者如柳州至貴州都勻的四百六十公里間，幾乎盡爲　烟瘴嶺之區，峭壁懸崖之地，物產旣鮮人烟又少，供應大批鐵道工作人員飲食所需，談何容易？加之卅三年黔桂之役，用兵近年，地方精華早己付諸砲火，大兵之後，又復繼以飢饉疫　人民元氣　喪，　符遍地，行旅為艱，所以復軌工程處此凡百困難條件之下，進行極爲不易年來員工死於疫病，死於盜賊者，爲數頗爲不鮮，如桂柳綫初復搶修之際，在脚板洲附近，工程師竟被匪盜慘殺，至今還是一件懸案。而沿綫各段班房工棚孤立荒野，屢受匪盜洗刧者，亦正不知凡幾。一方面是人為的災害，另一方面，而天然環境的限制如材料運輸，公路水運可以利用者，亦非易易，公路運輸車輛缺乏，而且費用昻貴，運輸量不多，至於水運，則鐵道所經河流，大抵鮮有舟楫之便，如柳來段的紅水河，桂柳段的永福河，維容河，柳江上游，大抵河流湍急灘石縱橫，失事者時有新闻，聞路局今春自桂北百壽洽購枕木一批，每根成本五千元左右，而運費竟達千元之巨。至於舟車不通之地，如黔南一帶，則惟有依持牛車而至馬駝運輸，力量更覺微不足這，而且正當搶修工作正當開展的時候，去年今年，都竟適與其會的遇着潦水成災，去歲經柳州至大灣的支綫，原爲搶修成績最佳的地段，然而一切工程就緒之時，却確上一塲大水，搭好的便橋如布遠河橋大溝河橋完全被洪水冲毀，幾至無法通車，幾經復修，延誤近月，始在八月中首先試車成功，完成湘桂黔路在桂境復活的第一聲，至於今年洪氾，爲數十年來所罕有，復路工程，更受掣肘，湘桂綫之重要橋梁如柳江大橋，維容鐵橋，湘江大橋，不但修築困難，連打撈工程也無法進行。記者自桂林到柳州，至雒容河竟需「駁車」始可抵步，維容鐵橋修築半載，至今還是幾個橋墩，說起來眞爲這鐵路嘆一口氣。自廣西河地南丹以北的獨山以至都筑段，程的苦惱，更倍蓗於桂境，　山峻嶺，道路險左，至令境內如東山坪，谷濛關，聞江寺等大隧道，到現在還沒辦法打通，一方面又要限期通車，的確是一件苦差。</p>
<p>另一方面，由於戰爭的禍害，三十三年冬，敵寇沿湘桂綫北搗貴州，直迫筑垣，自衡陽沿鐵路，以至獨山，禍害之烈，舉國罕見，破壞工作，一在於國軍戰略之需，二繼以敵軍敗微之時，兩路橋梁、隧道，涵洞，車站，機車，車皮，以至路軌，枕木，莫不盡量爆炸、一毀無餘，待得光復以後，千餘公里長龍，只餘繼續黃土萬段、偶有器材廢鐵拋棄道左，亦破災民鑒賣過活。而且粤漢路搶修長衝段之際還將湘桂路全州至衡陽碩果僅存百餘公里的道軌器材（比係敵寇佔領期間舖設、以供軍運，故能倖存）全部拆去濟急，因此當袁夢鴻局長先生覆新之際，眞有「光頭土地」之感，連一根道釘也難找的境况下，偉大的人力開始發揮功能，盡量彌補着工具的不足，機廠勞動終日的無名英雄用最簡陋最原始的工具把廢棄荒山的機車，開山機，抽水機，絞車，鋼　一起堆回廠裏，釘釘鑿鑒，裁裁併併，一年來出廠，而在車身上大書「湘桂黔路第X搶修隊」光榮標幟的機頭車身，車皮，有如上述。更有進者，舉如桂柳殺永福及鷓鴣江等地鐵橋，幾乎完全是用手錘和膠鉗在一段漫長的歲月裏以雙手拆卸，以雙手搭架，雙手功能，竟施諸一九世紀原子時代中進步的交通利器，不是奇蹟是啥？</p>
<p>然而，事實上也有多到不能說得出的器材，絕非雙手所可想出辦法的，譬如鐵橋的鋼樑，橋敎的洋灰，鋼軌配件，　機器材，行車設備，甚至小到一根道釘，也非仰求外洋而無以爲策，而外洋材料的遝入，一方面難得，一方而有限，（譬如聯總最近配售的新式機車，湘桂黔路壓根兒就沒份），往往修得路基，沒了鐵軌，有了鐵軌，沒有車輛。說可憐也就可憐到極，復工之初，需要士敏土十萬火急，交通部撥售不來，光是依靠貴州水泥廠一個月出產的二千桶貨，就這末將將就就，因此延誤工作不少，現在雖然可自廣州運來，行總亦有配給，可是輸運需日，輸運需錢，還是一個難題，然而供潦一過，便橋十九不堪使用，又非另築以作長久之計不可，情景至感棘手。</p>

<h3>文藝與政治</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>文藝與政治的關係，自古就挑起文壇的論爭，尚未獲得確實的解答。有些藝術至上主義者想把文藝超越政治的籠罩，純爲文藝的本身利益而服務；但這是可能的嗎？人是政治的動物，孤獨非所願，羣居是本能，人旣不能遺世而獨立，則文藝之爲文藝，也就無法羽化而登仙。不過，政治的理想與現實，是有相當的距離的，人們的政治理想，不妨從遠處大處着眼，甚至可以寄幻想於　渺的烏託邦，借以陶醉現實的苦悶；然在實施中的政治工作，總不免受牽制於現實的環境，紆廻遲緩浪費時力，看不見進步，跳不過必經的階段。臀如說，蘇聯的「國家凋殘說」，中國三民主義的「世界大同論」，可說是遠大的理想。蘇聯當納粹的大軍橫加蹂躪時，就不得不在政府的號召下，進行「愛國大戰」了。中國爲要抗拒日本軍閥的侵略，也祇有被迫着努力於史無前例的民族保衛戰，這完全是接受現實的敎訓。酷辣的現實敎訓，旣臨到我們頭上了，是不容許我們愛惜羽毛，迷戀於虛無飄渺的理想的。</p>
<p>文藝家自然要有遠大的理想；但文藝的迫切的任務，是把握現實，反映現實，所以，文藝的題材，意識，即文藝的內容，是無法游離現實的政治環境，而在自成的小天地內，孤芳自賞。</p>
<p>文藝所要表現的內容，不外乎是現實生活「明與暗」的兩面；不過，我們要嚴格注意的，就是作家們自己的立塲，是不是不　不依，服從眞理，純以效忠於國家民族的利益爲前提？是不是確能執行人民的代言人的任務，大澹地明是非、辨眞僞，指引人民從現實的苦海裏，超登幸福的彼岸，似使文藝工作者絕不爲自己打算，絕不把文藝當作敲門磚，或以之取悅於特權階層的心靈，或甘做少數人的應聲蟲，作欺騙人民的宣傳；那麼，他們的歌頌光明，就是指示出路，他們的暴露黑暗，就是反映光明，像這些善意的建議，友誼的批評，一般從政的人們，應該在鄭重考慮之後，表示誠懇的接受。</p>
<p>政治是衆人之事，政治上每一種新的設施，無不與人民的生活，息息相關；文藝的題材，倘不是像浪漫主義者，象徵主義者的憧憬於夢似的幻想，而是如實地措寫人生的話，則必與政治的實施發生直接或間接的關係，是無須懷疑的。基於這一個決定的判斷，作家們可以不參加政府的工作，更可以保持超然的態度，不掛名於黨團及會社，作爲政治組織中的一個細胞；但不能不以人民的代言人的資格，密切關注政治的實施，留意各　黨的黨綱政策及其作風，大公無私地督促政治的進步；而把自己所能透視的得失，利弊，運用熱練的文藝技術，澈底吿訴民衆，使各黨派的執政者在民衆的嚴密監視下，祗能絕對遵循有利於國家民族的方面，盡量表現工作的成績，來鞏固黨的信譽，博得人民的　議，不敢違背國家民族的利益，自燬政治生命，以便其私。所以，祗有超利害，明眞僞，辨是非，決不阿世從俗的文藝工作者，才是國家的衛星，政黨的諍友，人民的導導師。</p>
<p>文藝工作者的情感是眞實的，天良是純潔的，　別力是正確的，敏銳的，深刻的，時時刻刻不惜耗費全部的心力，巒切關係國家的前途，人民的疾苦。如有這樣的作家，尃於投機取巧，看風轉舵，順應惡劣的傾向，　取個人的虛譽，歌頌害國害民者為「前進」，呾咒愛國愛民者爲」落伍」，一味顛倒黑白，淆亂是非，則他們所寫出的東西，　能獲售於一時，使一般附庸風雅的盲目者嘗　而忘其矣，猶自以舐痂爲榮；但人民的限睛是雪亮的，他們看見「國家」的有機體組織，還沒有到凋殘的時候，他們與生俱來的「祖國國愛」，決不會被這些「前進」的傑作所冲淡，而這些「前進」的傑作，必在又一個大時代所掀起的民族主義的怒潮下，淹沒在海底！</p>
<p>更有進者，作家們實在要有一個政治的理想，作爲尋覓題材的標準的；而在各政黨中選擇其理想相同者正式參加，是爲了加速政治理想的實現，並不妨害寫作的自由；祗要不是利用黨團作背景，爭取個人的富貴，更無損於文藝工作的純潔與尊嚴。這就是說，文藝工作者是人民的訴苦者，是渴求理想的實行者，如在他們參加的黨團中，發生了禍國殃民的勾當，無異是損傷了自己的信仰，更應該仗義執言，予以絕不寬宥的校正與指摘。這才能發揮文藝工作者堅毅不屈的精神，領導人民前進！，領導時代前進！（一九四七，七，十一，於重慶。）</p>
<h3>女科員</h3>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>在山城的時候，我記不起是那一天了，大槪是王科員被斥退後的第三天吧，我們科裏來了一位新人。一個上下部很不相稱的身子，兩眼凹下去像個爛療孔，頫骨高高的聳起成兩座遙遙相對的山峯。頭髮是燙了的，遠遠看去像一堆烏雲，一團黑烟。上身穿着一件粉紅襯衣，下身穿着一條雪白的西裝褲，脚上還穿了一雙最時髦的香港花紋皮凉鞋，總之她的打扮是摩登的，是都市化的。她呌陳艷芳，名字聽起來倒很漂亮，據說她是來塡補王科員的位置的。</p>
<p>當天晚上（就是她來的那天晚上），有些好奇的同事們便悄悄地走到科長辦公室同時又是臥室的窗下竊聽，然而談話的聲音很低徽，低微得幾乎聽不出來。於是同事們一個個又悄悄地像偷兒沒有偷到東西般懊喪的走開了。</p>
<p>第二天，科長便帶了陳小姐到辦公室來同我們簡略的介紹了一下，這一介紹很引起一些同事們的驚訝和注意因爲在我們這科裏從來便沒有過女科員，而今天的陳小姐又打扮得這樣花枝招展。當科長走出辦公室去的時候，同事們頓時彷彿忘掉了眼前的陳小姐便紛紛議論起來；有些說她是個妖精，有些說她是個母夜叉，有些說她很漂亮。我看到陳小姐的臉紅一陣白一陣的變化起來，多量的胭粉仍舊掩不住臉上成堆的雀斑，我眞看不出她的漂亮地方來，我想同事們大槪是說她的裝束漂吧亮！</p>
<p>她恰恰坐在我的辦公桌對面，因此我同她比較有談話的機會</p>
<p>她說她愛好文學，有空的時候也喜歡寫點東西，她說她的文章時常在某日報「文藝副刋」上發表，顯然她有些以作家自豪。同時她說她也愛好音樂，曾參加過幾個盛大的演奏會，她對音樂的宏論是音樂能陶冶人的性情。……她羡慕都市的文明，她首先　儀山城的是，這兒有沒有電影院，有沒有咖啡館，有沒有舞廳，有沒有大酒樓，有沒有……這些我都給了她一個「沒有」的答覆，登時我看她顯得很懊惱的樣子，皺着眉頭，口裏不絕地喃喃着，我彷彿聽到她咒駡自己爲什麽要跑到這荒僻落後的山城來的聲音。最後她淤深地　了一口氣！唉！這樣的生活將是如何的乏味啊！</p>
<p>她說她在重慶的時候，一天也沒有離開過電影，她可以一口氣講出一連串明星如荻安娜寶萍。珍尼麥唐娜·泰隆鮑華·賈利古柏……等人的名字，我看她對這些人的名字有着濃厚的興趣。</p>
<p>上至科長，下至工友，她都一視同仁。無論在什麼時候，臉上總是堆滿了笑容，我從沒有看見她生過氣，我想這個人大槪很樂觀吧！</p>
<p>可是有一次她眞的生起氣來了。</p>
<p>那是一個夏日的傍晚，我們大家坐在院子裏納凉撩天，佻皮的小周同她開了這樣一個玩笑。「陳小姐你今年幾歲了，還沒有結婚吧。」</p>
<p>於是她咆哮起來了，大聲的駡了小周一頓便獨自去睡了。</p>
<p>每天她平均可以收到三四封信，掛號的，快遞的，或是，……因此她每天主要的工作不是科裘的等因奉此……而是親愛的小白鴿呀！她很耐心的分別回答他們的信，有時我看她對着寫好了的信發笑，然而我却不知道她到底笑些什麼。</p>
<p>突然有一天晚上小周跑來對我說陳小姐要走了，至於她爲什麽要走，沒有一個人知道。</p>
<p>「說不定她是回重慶去看電影吧」有些同事這樣揶揄她。</p>
<p>「說不定回重慶去結婚吧」有些同事這樣推測着。</p>
<p>果然第二天她走了，臨走時她來看了我一次，最後她說了一句我不懂的洋話：「So　iong，Ihope　that　I　could　see　youagain」，扭動兩爿肥大的臀部學着外國女明星走路的風度翩翻地去了。</p>
<p>半年後我到重慶，有一天我偶然在街上看到陳小姐同一位上了年紀的老頭子挽着手走着，我看她的肚子高高的凸了起來，我驚訝的間着自己陳小姐幾時結的婚，這末快便懷了孕。她安間的走着八字步子，凸出的肚子像一個輕氣球般飄浮在空中，我故意朝她面前走過去，我看她有點難爲情的想避開我，然而却被我喊住了。</p>
<p>「啊！陳小姐」！</p>
<p>她微微的同我點了點頭，老頭子帶着不高興的神色望着我，我正想走上前去同她說幾句話，却被老頭子像打漁殺家裏蕭恩似的拖着走了。</p>
<p>我眼看着那老頭和少女的兩個不調和的身影漸漸在我面前消失。</p>
<h3>烟雨篇</h3>
<p>— 吕莊</p>
<p>眺望雨景確是够有　的遐思的，</p>
<p>陌上的烟柳風　尤濃…………</p>
<p>我遐思到那陽陽光如酒的日子，</p>
<p>故園練蔭深處杜鵑呼喚出的，</p>
<p>一句急過一句的你我的名字………</p>
<p>我的心靈與眼　浸漏在烟雨中呢，</p>
<p>淡淡的水墨可亂不開太沉重的鄕愁；</p>
<p>今朝我駐足來這罪惡的城市，</p>
<p>時間之流給我帶走的只是一串空白的日子；</p>
<p>春去春來誰也不會有絲毫感應！</p>
<p>眺望雨景確是够有遼遠的遐思的，</p>
<p>我遐思到故園烟雨季節，</p>
<p>莊稼人牽着水牛，布谷島掠過天空</p>
<p>靑靑的稻苗，長長的阡陌</p>
<p>伴着田疇女的風韻全描在烟雨裏。</p>
<p>我該回去呵！我該趁着這烟雨之帆，</p>
<p>來到你們的隊伍裘，穿上昔日的芒鞋，</p>
<p>以貧血的手掌握着貧血的手掌吧！</p>
<p>讓我們並肩倚望那扇山　間，</p>
<p>一角藍天在閃耀；一角旗幟在飄揚！</p>
<h3>歸帆</h3>
<p>— 莫奈</p>
<p>英奈（Claude　Monet　1840－1926）是以「落日的印象」出品於一八六三年的沙龍被落選而出名的畫家。折謂「印象派」的名稱，就是根據他這幅畫來的；而這名稱在當時並不是頌揚，祇是一種無情的　刺。然而莫奈絡於是成功了，而且已被列入美術史光榮的一頁，被譽爲劃時代的革命畫家，印象主義的領袖。</p>
<p>所作以風景居多，此爲代表之作。（劉獅）</p>
<h3>沙士比亞　十四行詩</h3>
<p>— 眞勒試譯</p>
<p>第六十四首</p>
<p>我覓到那墳墓裏的遠代的</p>
<p>貴重的寶物被時間所磨滅；</p>
<p>看時見到高塔被推倒在地，</p>
<p>堅固的銅也做了死底奴隸，</p>
<p>我又見到貧婪的海洋侵佔</p>
<p>那屬於岸陸底王國的領士，</p>
<p>堅土也侵佔了大海底地盤，</p>
<p>雙方加多掠奪，把損失償補；</p>
<p>我見到了這些情境底滄梁，</p>
<p>或本身顛覆滅亡了的情境，</p>
<p>於是殘蹟就敎我這樣默想——</p>
<p>時間總窗來帶走我底愛人：</p>
<p>這念頭像死，敎我毫無別法，</p>
<p>只有哭着把怕失之物緊抓。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　356</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>瞧他走起路來，鶯行　步，前一登，後一拐，確然有些不受看。三者，他這時幹的秘密工作，據他自己說，這一身「行頭」，乃是「化裝」；不岔眼，不惹人注意；日僞特工眼裏看來」，僅僅是側小破落戶罷了；決不能說他是抗日學生。</p>
<p>這幾天來，他吃得如何，睡得如何，都不知道。但那張小長圓臉，仍舊黑裏透紅，一雙小臂仍舊那們圓鼓鼓地，一點也沒瘦下去。面孔上還是帶着些似傻似刁的笑容。</p>
<p>「可找到了你紀姨？」因　君吿訴我，小老虎正在追尋耀羣。</p>
<p>「才從紀姨那兒來，還有吳先生、申隊長。紀姨說她不上這兒來，呌我來陪您去一趟………十來里路，您坐車、步　，都行。」</p>
<p>步踱當然沒有坐車省力。况且，我既以十五號姿態，在這裏出現，步行反較乘車麻煩；因沿路日方「哨卡」太多，經過手續太多，不如乘車橫衝直闖，來得便利。（車上都貼有軍部符號）。</p>
<p>車由我　，路綫却由小老虎指引，左轉，右拐，一　眼就到了一個小村莊模樣地點。由小老虎指導，呌我把車停在一棵大樹脚下。小老虎在車上，一直左右前後不斷地放着「眼哨」，這是他細心謹愼的地方。下了車，他還不放心，回向瞧了又瞧，聽了又聽，斷定沒人追踪，也無崗哨注意，他才命令式的說：「老伯，走！」</p>
<p>「還有多遠？」我隨口問他。</p>
<p>「沒多遠；山路夾田埂，車子不能走，………：再翻過兩個小山頭就到。咱們慢慢走，老伯。」他體量我兩條腿的低能。</p>
<p>好。「沒多遠」一個山頭，又一個山頭；依照我的推算，少說也有五六里，並且都是小路，山徑。</p>
<p>在路上我一再盤問他這幾天「幹些什麽？」「在什麼地方？」「什麽時候找到紀　？」他老是含糊其辭，很巧妙地扯到不相干的事情上。我覺得他有些難言之隱，必是不大得意；於是賴得追問，只把我的經過，吿訴他一些。</p>
<p>「到了！」站在一個小山頭上，小老虎指着小谷底一個叢林；林內似乎有幾間茅廬。「您瞧那兒，老伯。」他抬起手來，指着對面小山包的西頭，遙遠的一點。我盡了我這五百度近視眼的視力瞧去，一點什麽也看不出；這才取出望遠鏡、對上了光點。</p>
<p>原來剛才瞧着一片糢糊的所在，約莫一千多米遠近，沿那北面山脚，有一條公路，蜿蜒到北山脚，近山脚，有一座橋樑。再看山東頭，條公那路，一直通了過去，直到遙遠的山峽內。</p>
<h3>鐘聲</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>在這俗塵喧　的都市裏，住久了總覺得煩悶，這裏最好的最美麗又恬靜的要算是這座敎堂的一角了。</p>
<p>夏季漸深，這襄四週的桐葉，更靑葱茂密了，枝幹警天屹立。旁邊是　着淡綠色的木柵，地上舖着載茸茸的靑草，薔薇和那些小喇叭一般的枝葉窈窕的小花，綴成冠環一般地繞遍了圖地。叢樹的中間，突出一座褐紅色的敎堂，屋頂上竪着白色的十字架，放射出閃爍皚潔的光輝：絲蔭紅屋交映在蔚藍色的天幕下，這一切都是在莊穆中帶着一種被壓抑的憂鬱，和期望的感慨—當凉風吹來時，輕輕的搖動滿樹的桐葉，悉索地搖響着，週圍的曠寂，激起了輕微的震動，這樣便更能加深了這情緒的色彩。</p>
<p>這座敎堂，處在這樣的都市裏—貧　懸殊最顯，利祿爭持最烈，邪惡虛榮最深………的地方。敎堂與此比照，顯然成了銳利的諷刺。可是正因爲是這樣，所以我很愛走過這裏，放慢了我的脚步，在綠鈀的低矮的灡　邊徘徊。我愛看綠蔭中間露出的紅牆，我愛看那十字架放出一簇銀白色的光彩，………</p>
<p>我聽過這敎堂裏的鐘聲，那是淸朗而咬亮的，但也是哀怨隱沉的，每次的鐘聲都是重甸甸的　着我。這本來是引渡衆生走上忠實的慈愛的至善境界；基督曾經爲了想要洗滌人間的罪惡被釘在十字架上，多少的殉道者以此鐘聲得瞑目安息，人們作懺悔禱吿，去創造新的日子，這是鐘聲最早給人的啓示。</p>
<p>聽着鐘聲，我想起數年前一個年老的英國女牧師引導我作祈禱，低聲地唸着美麗的詩句，想起她曾敎我怎樣去聽這鐘聲對人類精神的感召。然而到現在這只是僅能喚起一絲回憶而已了。我眼看着罪惡更在貪婪的滋長，到處是呌囂擾攘；在這都市裏，更暴露了肉慾的兇橫，人們瘋狂地在追求權力和金錢，現實給我太多的鞭笞了，我爲年老的慈靈的收師，和爲那些善良的忍辱的人們嘆息！</p>
<p>自然我還是愛着這座敎堂、也愛聽這鐘聲的。昨天我又在那邊走過，這一次聽着抑揚凄厲的鐘聲，一聲聲的敲起我更多的感喟；我一面走，一面聽着鐘聲慢慢的連續在響。然而在我的眼前，仍擋不住。都市裏的吆喝呌駡，和瀰漫着灰　與惡毒的氣息。從前我曾經寄予無限的想望、期待這鐘聲能嚴　地斥責那罪行者的懺悔，用情感去宣示人性的聖魔，現在我己經暫時擱置了這樣的心願了。</p>
<p>未來的歲月，朝夕相繼，這敎堂的鐘聲，將永遠不斷的　響下去，可是這都市裏的人們，對這鐘聲，不知是怎樣的感覺呢？我希望着終於有一天，在等待鐘聲響時，那悠揚溫和的聲浪，使我的情緒飛揚‘從此能游息在慈愛的互助的人海裏，再沒有陰險和罪惡。</p>

<h3>敎授解聘問題</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>前一時各方都在謠傳某某數大學敎授，將以解聘諭；本市大學敎授聯誼會，爲比亦曾數度舉行會議。</p>
<p>這個謠傳直到目前爲止，已經可以加以否定了。因爲大學爲一學術研究的聖地，敎授一方面爲國家培育人才，著書立論，一方面爲中國文化，科學，奠下神聖的大業。</p>
<p>爲了愛護中國少數學術人才，對於大學敎授，自應培加　護，務使他們能安心敎學；在這兵馬紛亂的年頭，爲中國立下一個學術的氣氛。</p>
<p>證之抗立　　張的談話，更證實我們所見的非謬。</p>
<p>杭次長說，敎部絕對未曾授　各大學解聘教授！</p>
<p>這表白，是多麽直率，多麽坦白。誰還能懷疑敎授解聘是曾受過授意的呢？</p>
<p>杭次長說，各大學校長有全權聘任敎授，各校擬聘請敎授名單，亦無需送敎部看過。意思就是說，各校有聘請敎授的自由，絕對不受任何約束。</p>
<p>這個說明，對於當前各大學所　單的流言，將爲之廓淸一時，這是值得我們欣慰，也值得我們興　的。</p>

<h3>不能目覩的：美國新海軍</h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>美國的海軍現在担任着它有史以來在和平時期的最重大任務，就是與英國合力警備世界上的貿易路綫。據海部長詹姆斯，福萊斯德最近宣稱，參加這非戰鬥行動的「現役」戰艦有三百艘之多——因爲這其實是「不能目覩的海戰」的一番預演。</p>
<p>所謂一不能目觀的海戰」，並不是將來大戰時的一種想像的行動：這詞兒實在代表着今後的美國全部海軍戰略，換言之，美國目前正在實行一大計劃，要把她那支古今最強大的海軍轉變爲一大隊「超級潛水艇。」</p>
<p>這計劃早已越過了「理想」的階段。據華盛頓出版的「美國新聞」報吿，海軍部正在要求國會准許它建造四千噸的實騐潛水艇，且國會己撥款三千萬美金來用在這上面，半打完全新型的潛艇，早已繪好了圖樣；而一九四年度的海軍概算四十四億又二八千萬美金、將有不少聽憑那「海底戰爭調度者」使用。</p>
<p>若要窺見一些正在形成中的「美國新海軍」的眞相，必先破除現有的關於水底下的艦艇的大小，功用，攻擊力量，和巡行範圍——的觀念。第二次世界大戰中所用的潛艇，差不多己陳舊得跟訥爾遜上將用以擊敗拿破崙的法西聯合艦隊的老式戰艦一樣了</p>
<p>新式「戰鬥艦」和航「空母艦」，都將是體積特大的潛艇。前者將裝備得可以放射飛彈，火箭——並執行大規模的海岸轟擊。後者將備有容納飛機的塲所和供幾架　火推進　起飛的甲板，並載送大隊的「陸戰隊」去登陸。</p>
<p>甚至於在海面下輸送噴火推進機的新法，也在被研究着，或有被認爲陳舊的可能，因爲飛彈和火箭之類，日益改進，會使駕駛人成爲無用，或退處於觀測員的地位。</p>
<p>在二次大戰期間由「PT船」祖任的工作——如困擾敵人的運轍艦，偵察，突入海港的襲擊……也將由水底下的船隻來負担。這些將是機動的小型潛艇，可溜進河口或越過了港口的防禦工事，去安置定時性的原子炸彈。</p>
<p>就是那些運輸艦和供應艦，也將航行於水底下，去撈濟遠的根据地。海軍部的設計人員認爲這支生死攸關的重要輔助部隊，如仍舊留在水面上，將成爲原子鐵爭時代攻守之中最弱的一環。</p>
<p>在「不能目覩的海戰」這戰略中，最富於革命性的特點，也許是在它預見到了用原子能來推水底下的船隻，使其速度與目前進最快的水面上艦艇相似。据「支加哥太陽報」駐華盛頓的通訊員G．彭克勞夫德說：這個計劃「早已經過了詳細的研究，据科學家和海界軍領袖們說，它距究全實現之期已不如多數人所想的那樣遠了」。</p>
<p>由於這種詳盡的研究　　子能來推進軍艦的事也許會比那些預言過的「非軍事上的」用處——例如推進火車龍頭啊，做工廠里的原動力啊，爲全市居民煮水發熱啊——實現得更早得多。</p>
<p>據「紐約前鋒論壇報」的記者J，米尼法說，美國「沉沒其海軍」的決心，顯然是由戰後的兩種發展促成的。第一種是發見了大戰末期的德國潛艇模型，比同盟國家當時所有的任何潛艇進步得多。假如敵人更早一些完成了他們那些有「通無筒」的潛艇和新式的魚雷，恐怕戰事的結局會大不相同的。</p>
<p>第二個因子是「比基尼的原子彈試騐」，這些試騐已表明潛艇比水面上的艦艇受害較輕。</p>
<p>此外還有一個因子是這事實：參加作戰的潛艇損失數，少於任何別類的艦艇。</p>
<p>在「比基尼」得到的敎訓，以及由研究俘獲的德國潛艇所得的敎訓，現在都正在編入美國的「超級潛艇」的設計中去—連一種裝有「接近信管」的魚雷在內，這種魚雷即使不射中鵠的也會爆炸的。</p>
<p>據海軍部的「海底戰爭調度者」C．W．史帶安少將說，明日的海底戰艦「將不僅是一種能够沒入水中的水面上船艦，而將是一種十足不扣的眞正海底艦艇。它很可能成爲明日海戰的主要武器。………這原子能的時代，也是眞正的潛水艦艇時代這種潛艇能留在水底下接連達幾個月之久，不需要時時浮到水面上來爲它們的蓄電池充電。」</p>
<p>至於仍將留在水面上的美國艦艇呢，其配備也以偵察潛艇的儀恭和抵禦潛艇的武器爲首要。這表示水而上的艦艇在今後將主要地用以輔助並保護水底下的軍艦。這種水面上的艦艇，在形狀和結構上，也將跟今日的一般軍艦相異得難以認識。它們將更其快速；它們的上層建築將减少到近乎零，使它們比較不易望見；它們的船身將製造得更能抵擋原子彈的煬炸。</p>
<p>傳統的「巨型戰門艦」的鼓吹着，大槪還要在海軍界的領袖們中間呼號幾年。可是各種現象却表示目前的美國海軍計劃大大地貶抑着主力艦在原子戰爭中的用處。現在仍在服役的戰鬥艦只有兩艘：「密蘇里號」在大西洋艦隊中，「衣阿華號」在太平洋艦隊中。</p>
<p>戰鬥艦「肯德基號」和戰鬥巡洋艦「夏咸夷號」，都正在被改造爲放射飛彈，火箭……的軍艦。</p>
<p>當美國海軍發動其「不能目覩的海戰」時，不得不自認「過時」而改造他們的思想的人，將不僅是海軍界的「耆宿」呢。</p>
<h3>徐娘</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>今人每以「徐娘半老，風韵猶存」八字，爲美人　暮之寫照，實則徐娘芳齡，不過二十有四，就昔日而論，固已半老，然就今日而言，則應列入「標梅」之數，未可遽以「半老」言也。又說者每將徐娘誤為駡操之徐母，菲止貽張冠李戴之議，抑且損有賢母之令譽，爲辨正計，謹依南史后妃傳表出之。</p>
<p>南史：梁元帝妃徐氏，美而悍，與帝共起湘東，帝即位，册爲妃，不安於宮，輙與左右及漂陽小吏季江通，帝雖知之，畏其悍，弗敢問也。先是，帝平侯景亂，中流矢，眇一目，徐妃每知帝將至，必爲半面粧以俟，帝覓則大怒而去，或令其歌，　歌「眇眇兮余懷」以應，帝由是不懌，經年不臨幸焉。妃自謂得計，益淫亂，江出語人曰：「溧陽馬雖老猶酸，徐娘雖老，猶尚多情」。旋因忤旨，坐廢。</p>
<p>由是知徐娘元帝非不愛之，特處處忤人意，不得不忍痛絕之耳。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>有不少自命爲中國通的美國人，對於四書五經略有所窺，便大賣其野人頭，竟著書立說起來，提到中國的禮記，一定引證「男子授受不親」，竟有一位女同學在公共汽車中向我提出，如果眞正男女授受不親，那末夫婦之間在做些什麽呢？我說夫婦之間，另有周公之禮，她始恍然大悟，知道中國也有握手擁抱接吻等等。美國也有類乎禮記一類的書，呌做Ettiquette，洋洋大觀，連請客帖的格式也包括在內，如果按書典的規定去做，未必在美國行得通，美國人請客除盛大宴會外，向不發帖子，祗通個電話就算數。有許多習慣不爲美國禮記所備載，謹寫出來給行將出國的自費留學生做個參考：你和女友同行時，你走在沿街的一邊，讓女友走在沿房屋的一邊，越過馬路後改變方向，得馬上調換位置，如果讓女性走在沿街的十邊，她一定認爲你有意侮辱她，因爲那是把她當作妓女看待了，如果你倆走進一家餐館或其他場合，入口有花盆等攔住去路，她走花岔有邊時，你不可走花盆的左邊，這樣個會吵架，美國女性是最迷信不過的，應該特別注意，如果你愛了她，你應該每天對她說愛她，否則她會發脾氣，提出控訴說你忘記了一句話，你在打　或打呵欠時，一定要說一句Excuse　me，不然她會抗議你又忘記了一句話，她和你接吻後，不可馬上當她的面用手帕去拭掉口紅，應當在她不注意時拭去，她走進電影院後說脚走痛了，那時命令你替她把皮鞋脫去的另一種說法，美國女子最喜歡當着其他賓客用自己的叉夾着等送進你的口中，你量得不好意思承受而拒絕不吃，那是極大的失體，美國女人最喜歡罰咒，話說僵了，便會罰咒，你得隨風使舵，快快讓步，否則這得她哭了，還得你賠罪。你到美國須得學會吃口哨，吹口哨和鼓掌同爲稱讚美色的一種表示，被你吹口哨的人非但不怒、反而要回眸一笑，說聲Thank　yon．（二六）</p>
<h3>科學小品　空中碼頭（上）</h3>
<p>— 顧均正</p>
<p>如果人類能够免去原子戰爭，那末我們一定可以造成一個空中碼頭，作爲空間船旅行月球的一個出發點。</p>
<p>空間船中應用了原子能，雖然己無申途添加燃料的必要，然而空中碼頭的本身，自有許多動人的而有用的特點，值得我們去努力。</p>
<p>什麽東西可以把這個空中碼頭支持在空間中呢？這是聽到這個計劃的人一定要首先發問的。驟然一想好像這是不可能的事，但是實際上牠的原理却是非常簡單的。</p>
<p>試設想有一座高山，牠的峯頂矗立在空間之中，在這峯頂上有一個假想的大砲。我們知道大砲的水平射程，隨射出子彈的初速而異，要是這個初速異常巨大，那末牠甚至會沿地球環繞一次，而有回射其自身的可能。這樣的初速約爲每秒五英里，稱爲圓速度（Circular　velocity），因爲射出物有此速度，就能繼續着繞地珠兜圈子，永不停止。</p>
<p>爲什麽這射出物不掉到地面上來呢？回答是這樣：牠並非不掉，只是永遠掉不到地面上來</p>
<p>你不懂這話的意思嗎？那你可以這樣想：任何發射的子彈，必同時作着兩種運動。第一種運動是由於砲口的初速；第二種運動是由於重力的吸引。這兩種運動合併起來，就造成了一條彎曲的彈道。</p>
<p>假使子彈的初速愈大，那末這彈道的曲度就愈爲平坦，芳是初速增大到某一極限，必可使彈道的曲度適與地球面的曲度相合。在這時候，發射物雖然繼績地在向地面下掉，可是因爲地球表面的向下彎曲之率，剛好跟發射物受重力的作用而向下降落之率適相一致，所以就永遠掉不到地面上來了。</p>
<p>當任何發射物沿堆球的切綫方向射出去的時候，如果牠的速度到達了每秒五英里，都可以有上述的現象發生。要使一個大砲造成這樣的初速，是不可能的事，並且即使可能，對於我們也沒一點用處。</p>
<p>然而要使一隻空間船在五〇〇英里的高空中造成這樣一條環繞地球的職道，却是可能的，而且這比之月球旅行要容易得多了。空間船一經到了這個軌道上，就不用再消耗燃料，無論牠繞着地球一次，兩次，十次，二十次、以至無數式、都是一樣，只有在駕駛員要回到地球上來的時候，　需要燃料。這時候所耗的燃料，是供减低空間般的速度，使之下掉到空氣圈以內，並作降落之用的。這樣一個理想將來必先月球旅行而實現、這個理想實現以後，我們就可以化六十八噸的燃料來把一噸的配備帶到這一條軌道上去，然後在那里建築起一個永久的空中碼頭來。</p>
<p>這個碼頭建立了起來以後，那末不但是月球旅行，就是與其他星球間的交通也不是難事了。因爲第一，在五六百哩的高空中，地球的重力作用已非常微小，這對於空間船的進行，是一種特殊的方便。第二，在五六百哩的高空中，空氣十分稀薄，空間船在此差不多無　克服空氣的阻力。第三，碼頭的本身對地球已經具有每秒鐘五哩的速度，所以空間船若從這里出發，比較從地球上出發，就可以增加每秒五哩的速度。</p>
<h3>蘇聯火團</h3>
<p>— 起元</p>
<p>蘇聯是第二次大戰　的世界上的一團火，這團火究竟延燒到如何程度？或而竟蔓延到全大陸的每個角落，或而被更廣大的海水掩沒了！還非今日的聰明人們所能預知的。讀過化學的人，都知道一團火的構成，有三個部份，一個是焰心，一個是內熖，另一個是外熖。所以美國的國際間題作家特爾斯（CFestet　Duller）他把蘇聯這團火，也分爲核心內圍外圍三個部份（地帶）。</p>
<p>核心地帶包括一九一七年蘇聯成立時之土地，及以後加入蘇維埃聯邦的各共和國外，還包括芬蘭北部，芬蘭南部之可以直通波羅的海的地區，愛沙尼亞，拉脫維亞，立陶宛等三小共和國，德國東普魯土之北部，波蘭之東半部，捷克之東部（即所謂Czltpztbo－Uktzide），羅馬尼亞之比薩拉比亞及布庫維亞，岡拉杜凡，亞洲之旅順，庫頁島之南部，千島羣島，連土爾其的卡爾斯及愛爾斯蘭姆兩省，也有接近這個地帶的可能。</p>
<p>內圍地帶包括凡接近核心地帶的雖尚不能稱之爲蘇聯的一部份，而却受蘇聯的軍事支配的，如中歐方面的波蘭，德之東部，奧之東部，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，南斯拉夫，阿爾巴尼亞。亞洲之外蒙古，我國之東北長春鐵路區，大邁，新　及朝鮮北部等。最近還可能擴充到希處、伊朗，土爾其，庫提斯坦及朝鮮南部。</p>
<p>至於外　　帶，因其離核心較遠，不能採取直接行動，故對　　立國家與殖民地，採用三個方法：（一）在殖民地，則鼓動革由及殲立運動。（二）在獨立　家，碼利馬會該　的共產黨。（五）如無共　　　　　左　的存在，　　勵　　　　的　　。</p>

<h3>Helping Me Solve Urgent Problems: Special Envoy Wedemeyer Flies to Beijing; This Afternoon to Meet Chairman Chiang at the National Government</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: Washington officials stated that Wedemeyer's arrival in China will immediately assist China in solving its urgent problems at the highest speed.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] U.S. President's Personal Representative General Wedemeyer and his party of ten, aboard a silver C54 special plane No. 49149, landed at the Beijing University parade ground air force base at 5:20 PM on the 22nd. Mr. Wedemeyer, tall and spirited, wearing a sky-blue white linen suit, a silk blue and white floral tie, black leather shoes, and carrying a white wide-brimmed straw hat, first appeared at the plane door, nodded in greeting to the grand welcoming crowd, smiled as he stepped down the ramp, and shook hands with Ambassador Stuart, Director Ling Qihan, Government Commissioner Song Ziwen, Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang (Chairman Chiang's representative), Chief Secretary Gan Naiguang (President Zhang Qun's representative), Minister Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, Chairman Weng Wenhao, Mayor Shen Yi, and others, exchanging pleasantries. After inspecting the National Government honor guard amidst melodious ceremonial music, he and the Ambassador and his entourage proceeded to the U.S. Ambassador's residence on Shanghai Road to rest and have dinner. Mr. Wedemeyer stayed in the room next to the Ambassador's on the upper floor of the residence, while his entourage stayed in the prepared rooms inside the U.S. Embassy. According to his news consultant, Mr. Watson, who spoke to reporters, they flew from Guam at 6:30 AM and had a very safe and pleasant journey. The itinerary in Beijing is yet to be determined, but they will obtain various relevant data as soon as possible for preliminary research. They will use Nanjing as the base of operations for this trip, and then go north to conduct fact-finding investigations. If conditions permit, northern Korea under Soviet control will also be a subject of investigation. Watson confirmed that Mr. Wedemeyer did not carry any private letters, and the delegation's mission must be completed within six weeks.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: U.S. President's Special Representative General Wedemeyer is scheduled to visit Chairman Chiang at the National Government at 11:00 AM on the 23rd, visit President Zhang Qun at the Executive Yuan at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, visit Minister Wang Shijie at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:30 PM, and attend a dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife in the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] General Wedemeyer intends to reduce social engagements as much as possible during his visit to Beijing, as he believes that such engagements may take up his work time, and his stay in China is very short and should not be wasted. President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan mentioned this matter in the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 22nd, saying that it was Mr. Wedemeyer's opinion. As far as is currently known, in addition to the dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife, the U.S. Embassy will hold a grand reception, and the government will jointly host a banquet once by various leaders.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] The city of Beijing has been sweltering recently, with the room temperature consistently reaching 100 degrees. According to old people, this is unprecedented in seventy years. After General Wedemeyer got off the plane, he and Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang, Chairman Chiang's representative, shook hands and took a photo, jokingly saying, "It's so hot!", which amused the government officials and reporters who braved the heat to welcome him.</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Wedemeyer Issues Statement</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Nanjing, 22nd] General Wedemeyer arrived in Beijing on the 22nd to begin a six-week on-site investigation of the situation in China and Korea. He recently issued the following statement to reporters:</p>
<p>"I previously served in China for quite some time as Chief of Staff to Chairman Chiang and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in China. It has been more than a year since I left China. I am very pleased to return to this old place and meet with all of you old friends again. I have always hoped to relive the warmth of this friendship. Unfortunately, my stay in China this time is very short. My time and energy must be constantly devoted to the extremely important work of both China and the United States, so I anticipate that there will not be much time for us to meet, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Regarding the work to be done in the next six weeks, I will only give a general overview. I have been ordered by the President of the United States to come and investigate the general situation in China and Korea, that is, the current situation in the two countries and their ability to recover in the future. The basic nature of my mission is to investigate the facts, assisted by a small team of experts. These experts have rich experience in economics, finance, engineering, and politics. What we are most concerned about is to learn about the measures taken by the Chinese government to achieve recovery and how effective they are.</p>
<p>The time limit for completing our mission is very short. The personnel in my mission must devote all their time to searching for and evaluating various reports. This kind of report is not only crucial to China, Korea, and the United States, but also obviously important to the whole world. I am determined that our work will have real and timely value. If so, then we must take on this responsibility with an open mind.</p>
<p>Good results are most likely to be obtained through sound and prudent planning. This kind of planning is not only based on what we hope to be true, but also on what we know to be true through objective and thorough observation.</p>
<p>This statement explains why I am currently unable to make any statement of expectations or intentions, but one thing I can tell you is that I will do my best to fulfill the instructions given to me by President Truman to determine all the facts about the political, economic, and military situation, whether favorable or unfavorable, link these facts to each other, and then evaluate them, and at the end of my mission, present the results of this work to the President of the United States."</p>

<h3>Full Text of Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] The economic reform plan passed by the National Economic Council on the 21st has been sent to the Executive Yuan and submitted to the National Government. It is scheduled to be submitted to the State Council meeting for discussion on the 25th, and will be announced and implemented after it is passed by the State Council. After being researched and revised by various experts, the plan has become more detailed than the original plan. The full text of the plan passed by the Economic Council is as follows:</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Our country is founded on strictness, has a vast territory and abundant resources, and abundant labor. However, the current economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious, and it is urgent to first explore the root cause of the problem as the basis for reform. According to economic activities, production is the major premise. There are three factors of production: land, capital, and labor. What the countryside lacks is only capital, and general financial institutions are still unable to accept land as collateral, and there are no specialized land financial institutions. Currently, the agricultural loans of various banks are also very small and do not help the situation. The advantages of our country's vast territory, abundant resources, and abundant labor have not been fully realized. This is actually due to the lack of sufficient financial support. How should future policies start from utilizing the abilities of the majority of the people? How can the financial system itself be sound and substantial? How can its funds be properly coordinated with land and labor to achieve rural prosperity, increase farmers' purchasing power, and lay the foundation for the development of domestic livelihood industries? As for the business of various banks, there should be a clear division of labor, each with its own specialty, each with its own mission, and mutually contributing to the development of the economy. This is what financial reform should urgently seek. Secondly, how to make an agricultural country move towards industrialization is the most important issue for national construction in the future. The development of various production and construction undertakings in our country should have a comprehensive plan, even if the strength of the people and the government is combined, and they cooperate according to the plan, it is still insufficient. In fact, the division between state-owned and private industries is not clear, resulting in insufficient strength on the one hand and hesitation on the other hand. The government has not fully fulfilled its function of supporting various private enterprises. As for fixed assets such as factory buildings, factory land, and machinery, both state-owned and private enterprises have not obtained sufficient convenience to use them as collateral for re-production. It is difficult to expect various financial industries to develop in a planned manner. How to use national capital as a leader in the future, to guide the activity of private capital, to allow state-owned enterprises to take on the difficult tasks, and to assist private enterprises to take on the easy tasks, so that the government and the people can work together, and to welcome foreign capital and technical talents with preferential methods, to achieve the goal of industrialization. This is what production and construction reform should urgently seek. Again, finance should start from developing various production industries, so that the proportion of income can be expected to increase. If the government budget cannot be balanced for a day, the currency will inevitably increase. In addition, the fact that the total funds are truly used for production also causes currency inflation, resulting in shrinking production, lack of materials, skyrocketing prices, and soaring interest rates, thus the source of taxation is exhausted, and the gap between income and expenditure becomes increasingly disparate. In the past, we did not seek solutions from effective methods of increasing and supervising production, but only focused on temporary remedial measures, which were all counterproductive. How can we carefully measure the currency system itself in the future, how can we increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and how can we improve the collection policy, so that the financial foundation can be strengthened with the development of various production undertakings, and the production capacity of hundreds of millions of people and their total income can support the finances of the entire country? This is what financial reform should urgently seek. The following is a brief description of the main points of the above three reform strategies:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Finance</p>
<p>The reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the country's economic policy, to achieve the main goal of making the land fully utilized (agriculture), making the materials fully used (industry), and making the goods smoothly circulated (commerce). Financial institutions should each have their own specialized business for increasing production, so that the phenomenon of ordinary commercialization can be eliminated. Public and private banks must be planned and distributed throughout the country, so that they can become a systematic financial network, and not be concentrated in coastal cities, especially in the corner of Shanghai, creating a skewed phenomenon. The following are the reform methods for financial organization and business:</p>
<p>(1) The county bank is the foundation of the financial system. It should be thoroughly rebuilt and supported for its development. Its main business is to develop the rural economy, facilitate local construction, and cooperate with the implementation of local autonomy. It should be established in each county in principle. Its funds are invested by the county government with the public funds of the county, township, and towns, and private shares can also be raised. At the same time, the Central Bank and the Provincial Bank should also invest appropriately as a leading share, and should provide specialized talents and provide business guidance and supervision.</p>
<p>Depending on the type and needs of its business, the county bank should be assisted by the China Farmers Bank, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China.</p>
<p>(2) The Provincial Bank's main business is to regulate the province's finances, support economic construction, and develop the province's production undertakings.</p>
<p>The Provincial Bank is located in the provincial capital. Its branch locations are limited to important political and economic centers in the province.</p>
<p>(3) Land finance should be designated by the government with special funds, and land bonds should be issued. A specialized bank should be established at an appropriate time to manage it.</p>
<p>(4) The China Farmers Bank's professional scope is to support rural prosperity, and it operates agricultural production, farmland water conservancy, agricultural product transportation and sales, and land finance loans to facilitate farmers.</p>
<p>(5) The Bank of Communications' professional scope is to assist in the development of industries, and it operates loans for industry, mining, transportation, and public utilities.</p>
<p>(6) The Bank of China's professional scope is to assist in the development of domestic and foreign trade, and it operates loans related to domestic and foreign trade and production undertakings, advances, and international remittances.</p>
<p>(7) The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau's professional scope is to absorb people's savings deposits and handle small remittances.</p>
<p>(8) The Central Cooperative Treasury's professional scope is to support the organization and development of various cooperatives with cooperative loans.</p>
<p>(9) The Central Trust Bureau specializes in trust reinsurance and insurance for public enterprises, and is responsible for guiding the trust insurance business of private enterprises.</p>
<p>(10) The Central Bank is the bank of banks, and its main responsibility is to regulate the country's finances, so that finance and the economy are closely linked to assist economic construction.</p>
<p>(11) After the restoration is completed, the Four Joint Offices will be changed into a design and contact institution, or merged with the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and changed into the Financial Administration Bureau, which is under the Ministry of Finance, to unify power.</p>
<p>(12) The classification and distribution of private banks shall be stipulated by the government, and the amount of their capital shall be increased. Small banks and money shops shall be merged and organized to strengthen their capital. The use of their funds shall be stipulated by the government with standards and strictly managed.</p>
<p>(13) Each national bank shall be responsible for contacting and guiding the business of ordinary banks with the same nature within its professional scope, and the scope and location of its branch offices shall also be stipulated separately according to its business object. (The following text turns to page two)</p>
<h3>The President's Intention to Campaign in His Hometown is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Reports in Beijing and Shanghai newspapers that Chairman Chiang intends to run for National Assembly representative in his hometown of Fenghua are inaccurate, according to reporters who have learned from relevant sources.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng to Broadcast Tonight</h3>
<p>Coordinating Communist Suppression and National Construction Propaganda</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Central Broadcasting Station will invite the heads of central organs to broadcast speeches from the 23rd to coordinate the suppression of communism and national construction propaganda. The person invited to broadcast at 8:00 PM on the 23rd is Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters. In addition, the flood in Guangdong Province is serious. Lin Yizhong, Lu Yougang, Hu Mulan, and others, speakers of the Provincial and Municipal Councils of Guangdong Province, are scheduled to broadcast to overseas Chinese at 7:30 PM on the 24th at the Central Broadcasting Station, calling for disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Strengthens Financial Control</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Since the General Mobilization Order was promulgated, the Ministry of Finance has formulated the following measures to strengthen financial control:</p>
<p>1. Control the financial market: (1) Designate areas and strictly manage remittances according to the situation in the financial market in various places. (2) The Central Bank shall supervise the banking industry in various places to carefully review and reasonably control interest rates in accordance with the regulations on loan interest rates for bank management, and supervise their implementation. (3) Supervise the legal circulation of negotiable instruments and impose strict sanctions on the use of illegal negotiable instruments and bad checks.</p>
<p>2. Strengthen the management of banks and money shops: (1) Resolutely implement the measures to strengthen the control of financial business and the Ministry of Finance's bank management methods. Those who violate the provisions of these measures in the handling of bank and money shop funds shall be severely punished. (2) Commercial banks and money shops shall not sell their licenses. When it is necessary to increase capital and reorganize, the total amount of shares of the original shareholders shall be strictly limited. (3) Restrict the establishment of credit cooperatives, and the financial authorities shall cooperate with the cooperative authorities to effectively manage credit cooperative business. (4) The inspection work of banks and money shops in important cities shall be carried out strictly. (5) Strictly crack down on underground money shops and prohibit companies and shops from collecting deposits. Violators shall be punished according to law.</p>
<p>3. Crack down on speculative trading: (1) Strictly crack down on the black market for gold and banknotes, strengthen inspections, and reward informants. After being seized, they shall be severely punished according to law. (2) Strictly crack down on the private operation of goods sales by banks and money shops. Violators shall be punished according to law. (3) Strengthen the supervision of the business of the stock exchange, strictly crack down on speculative manipulation, and strictly prohibit off-site transactions.</p>
<h3>Proportional Number of Seats for Each Party in General Election to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>Reorganization of Local Governments Under Negotiation</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] According to sources: After repeated consultations between government representatives and representatives of the Democratic and Youth Parties on the proportional distribution of seats for representatives of each party in the general election, a conclusion has been reached. Initially, the two parties requested a ratio of 2:1:1. It is reported that the government can currently agree to 3:1:1:1, that is, the total number of representatives of the Democratic and Youth Parties and social elites is equal to the number of representatives of the Kuomintang. As a result of the negotiations, it will be formally announced within ten days. In addition, negotiations on the reorganization of local governments are also underway. In principle, the government agrees, but implementation must be gradually advanced. It is said that the Youth Party is very active in this regard, while the Democratic Socialist Party hopes to first obtain the right to speak and supervise in local politics. The party has already registered those who are willing to participate in local politics in order to recommend them to the government in the future.</p>

<h3>Additional Engineering Funds for Two Ports Reach 120 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Huludao Port is currently the only port for our external transportation in the Northeast. However, the port's original single pier has been in disrepair for years, and the waterway has been silted up, making it necessary to repair it in a timely manner to avoid total collapse. The construction period for the port is from July to October, and it is inconvenient to work after that period. The total engineering cost required is over 400 billion. However, for the sake of the national treasury's expenditures, the Ministry has prepared an estimate for emergency repairs, which can build three piers and requires 42.662 billion National currency. After the completion of this project, ships of 10,000 tons or more can safely enter the port and dock, which will greatly benefit transportation in the Northeast. The Executive Yuan has decided to approve an additional 40 billion yuan, including the previously allocated 2 billion yuan, which will be deducted. The Executive Yuan has also approved an additional 80 billion yuan for the Tanggu New Port project, to be allocated in installments. The following items are planned to be completed by the end of the year: (1) The waterway is clear, and 3,000-ton ships can pass through the locks to Tianjin, and 5,000-ton ships can dock at Tanggu, avoiding the need to wait for tides offshore for lightering. (2) 5 to 7 ships of 3,000 to 5,000 tons can dock in front of the first pier. (3) Complete the railway and warehouses to facilitate coal exports and material storage and transportation. (4) Prepare icebreakers to maintain winter navigation. In terms of its location, the port is quickly connected to Pingjin. In terms of military and economic relations, it is extremely important.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to strengthen air transportation in the Northwest and achieve the goal of regularly maintaining two monthly flights from Shanghai to Hami and Shanghai to Dihua, the government has decided to subsidize fuel and transportation costs totaling 2.5 billion yuan from May to December of this year.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Economic Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Continued from the First Page</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Production and Construction Workers</p>
<p>At present, various production enterprises are萎缩(wēisuō, withered, shrank), and the nation's human and material resources have not been fully utilized. The government's future policy should be: (1) to provide as much protection as possible for existing production and construction enterprises, in order to stabilize employment and prevent unemployment. (2) To gradually increase new production and construction enterprises through effective planning, and guide idle manpower to participate in production. (3) Encourage scientific inventions and advocate labor service, in order to transform the scholar style and encourage the spirit of creative enterprise. (4) To coordinate planned education with planned economy, so that talent cultivation is integrated with production and construction. Increased agricultural and industrial production, supplemented by convenient transportation, will stimulate creation, welcome foreign investment, and gradually stabilize prices. The following are the measures for developing electricity, agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation, increasing production, and stabilizing prices:</p>
<p>1. Agriculture: Farmers account for the absolute majority of the population, and agriculture is the backbone of the Chinese economy. When agriculture is developed, the countryside is prosperous, and farmers have their purchasing power, then industry will have a basis and society can be stable. Therefore, developing agriculture and prospering the countryside are the main objectives of the implementation of future economic policies. The methods are:</p>
<p>(1) Reform the distribution relationship of agricultural land to fully improve it. For the use of tenancy relationships, the principle of "25% rent reduction" should be thoroughly promoted, and ways should be sought to implement "land to the tiller" as much as possible so that farmers can engage in production.</p>
<p>(2) Encourage reclamation and select sites to pilot collective farms and cooperative farms. Using new machines and methods, increase production to demonstrate to farmers. Expand agricultural experiment and research sites to improve production technology.</p>
<p>(3) For agricultural reform, water conservancy is important. Large-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of trunk canals should be actively carried out by the state. The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and branch canals should be supervised by the central government to be carried out by provinces and counties. Permission can be requested to issue water conservancy bonds, and the completed projects will be the responsibility of the local area for maintenance.</p>
<p>(4) Expand and improve rural cooperative organizations, and truly facilitate agricultural loan procedures, in order to reduce the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>(5) The ever-normal granary system urgently needs to be established. The initial plan for building warehouses and storing grain must be completed as soon as possible in the key locations of the Yangtze River basin. Local grain accumulation should also be strengthened and universally implemented to increase reserves.</p>
<p>(6) The Farmers Bank of China should actively promote its agricultural warehouse mortgage and agricultural product transportation and sales business, with the goal of using financial power to assist the government in supporting production, controlling grain sources, and regulating surpluses and deficits.</p>
<p>(7) Establish nurseries widely, promote afforestation, and use effective methods to maintain their growth. Natural forests and conservation forests should be owned and operated by the state, while other barren mountains and wastelands suitable for forestry should be supervised for private operation, and attention should be paid to the operation and encouragement of fuel wood forests.</p>
<p>(8) Take advantage of agricultural leisure to train farmers in techniques such as civil engineering and stonework, and develop rural sideline businesses to improve farmers' lives.</p>
<p>(9) For animal husbandry, attention should be paid to preventing and controlling animal diseases, improving livestock quality, increasing livestock breeding frequency, and promoting increased livestock production. In all agricultural areas, forage crops should be increased, and wasteland should be used to expand livestock breeding. In all natural pastoral areas, livestock breeding should still be the focus, and grassland management should be strengthened, grasslands cultivated, and improved forage planted to stabilize and increase livestock production and improve the livelihoods of herdsmen.</p>
<p>(10) Develop marine and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture, encourage farmers to raise fish, and promote aquaculture processing industries. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Mystery of Flying Saucers Revealed: One Crashed Near Chengdu; Experts Study as Weather Instrument</h3>
<p>[Our Chengdu Dispatch of the 22nd] Recently, a "flying saucer" was also discovered in Chengdu. On the 18th, several silver-gray, circular luminous objects flew over Chengdu from the southeast high altitude, sparkling like meteors. One of them crashed in Zhongxingchang, Huayang County, about twenty miles from the city. It was picked up by local villagers and sent to Sichuan University for research.

<h3>Editorial: After Wedemeyer's Arrival in China</h3>
<p>General Wedemeyer arrived in Nanjing yesterday afternoon at 5 pm from Guam. The fact-finding mission composed of American political and economic experts also arrived in our nation's capital at the same time. Starting today, they will begin their work of investigating the actual political and economic situation in China. We, standing from the perspective of the Chinese people, regardless of whether the task undertaken by this "Friend of China," General Wedemeyer, is significant, and regardless of whether the mission he undertakes will be successful, cannot help but express our heartfelt welcome. Now, as General Wedemeyer is about to begin his work, we wish to state the common aspirations of our Chinese people.</p>
<p>First, we must first point out to General Wedemeyer that the current situation in China, whether politically or economically, is in a state of turmoil. However, this chaotic situation can only be regarded as a microcosm of post-war world politics and cannot be seen as a source of turmoil in Asia or the world. Only by understanding this characteristic of the Chinese political situation can we prescribe the right medicine and give China's chronic illness hope of recovery. Otherwise, relying solely on General Wedemeyer's personal feelings for China to prompt the United States to provide some material assistance to China will not only be of no help to China, but also the ultimate goal of President Truman's appointment of General Wedemeyer to come to the East will not be fully realized!</p>
<p>Second, we want to further explain that the evolution of the Chinese situation to this point is by no means the sole responsibility of the Chinese people or the government. We may as well recall the situation in the Far East since Japan's unconditional surrender. Although Japan temporarily withdrew from the Far Eastern political stage due to its defeat in the war, on the other hand, the importance of the Soviet Union on the Far Eastern political stage increased. Our country's diplomatic authorities were keenly aware of the changes in the Far Eastern situation after the war, so they attached particular importance to diplomacy with the Soviet Union, even at a significant cost, to obtain the friendship of the Soviet Union. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is an excellent testimony to this. However, the results we obtained after paying a considerable price were: (1) the removal of industrial equipment from Northeast China; (2) the obstruction of our country's takeover of Lushun and Dalian; (3) the invasion of our country's Xinjiang Province by Outer Mongolian troops; (4) the participation of Korean communists and Japanese prisoners of war in the communist army rebellion in the Northeast. In this situation, how can China achieve peaceful unity politically? How can it achieve stability and prosperity economically?!</p>
<p>Third, without us explaining it, General Wedemeyer will know that the losses suffered by China during this war were greater than those of any European country. After the war, China was deeply wounded and wanted to revive and prosper, so it naturally needed external assistance. Since the issue of Japanese reparations cannot be resolved for the time being, the Chinese people's hopes are naturally placed on our allies. However, several months ago, Secretary of State Marshall spared billions of dollars to aid the recovery of European countries, but for China, he kept the 500 million in loans that had already been allocated but not yet released. This American approach, which still does not escape European centrism, will inevitably arouse suspicion among the Chinese people about American policy. Fortunately, General Wedemeyer has now been ordered to come to China, and these unnecessary misunderstandings can be swept away. We are very willing to frankly tell General Wedemeyer that China and the United States were allies fighting shoulder to shoulder during the war and had endured hardships together. Now that the war is over, China still hopes for the assistance of the United States so that the two countries can move towards a common ideal. Therefore, China does not forget old friendships and sincerely hopes for American assistance, which is by no means out of selfish motives. We believe that General Wedemeyer will certainly understand this point.</p>
<p>In short, General Wedemeyer is our "Friend of China" who not only understands the political situation in China, but also understands the feelings and aspirations of the Chinese people. Now, after a gap of one year and three months, he has come to China again. He arrived in Nanjing yesterday and revisiting the old place must make him feel particularly cordial. We do not want to say much, but we hope that General Wedemeyer will observe the facts more, have more contact with our country's officials and civilians, thereby understand China and recognize the Far East, complete his mission within six weeks, and report his findings to President Truman one by one as a basis for the United States to change its policy towards China!</p>
<h3>A Call for Basic Education</h3>
<p>The United Nations Far East Regional Basic Education Conference will soon be held in our country. In order to synthesize opinions from all parties, the Ministry of Education convened a preparatory meeting on the 10th of this month, specially inviting more than 60 experts to attend. The meeting lasted for three days and concluded on the 12th. The conference was presided over by Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education and passed many important proposals on basic education and prepared to hold an exhibition. But what is the state of basic education for our own people? On the eve of this grand event, we should first conduct an honest review.</p>
<p>Currently, there are approximately 67 million school-age children nationwide between the ages of six and twelve. (75% of them are in rural areas, 15% in cities, and 10% in border areas.) Only 27 million are enrolled, accounting for just over one-third of all school-age children. The remaining 60% or so of school-age children have not enjoyed basic education. Only in Taiwan Province, 95% of the 878,580 school-age children are enrolled. The national illiteracy rate is as high as 72%. This is how we see the basic education of our people from the perspective of "quantity."</p>
<p>The health condition of school-age children is even more frightening. According to the report of Mr. Zhang Tianlin of the Ministry of Education on his inspection of national education in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, and other places, only 10% of school-age children are considered healthy, 90% are unhealthy, 50% are malnourished, and 80% have trachoma. These are truly alarming figures and are the most serious problem in our country. Qualifications of elementary school teachers: Graduates of normal schools account for 36.39%, graduates of other schools account for 47.58%, and those without school education account for 16.3%. According to statistics of the qualifications of 30,000 elementary school teachers in 14 provinces and cities reported in May 1946, most of them were graduates of junior high schools. They have not received sound teacher training. As for the rudimentary school facilities, the lack of teaching materials and equipment, and the adherence to outdated teaching methods, they are all obvious facts. Therefore, it is estimated that students' level has dropped by two years compared to before the war.</p>
<p>The adult education department of national schools, originally intended to provide remedial education for the illiterate, is even more nominal. From the perspective of most rural villages across the country, this has almost become a legal term and a term used by teachers in the classroom. According to reports from various places, the Ministry of Education said that in 1945, 7 million adults and 3 million women nationwide were receiving remedial education. Even if these figures are accurate, compared to the proportion of illiterates in our country, the achievements of adult education are not worth mentioning. This is how we see the basic education situation in our country from the perspective of "quality."</p>
<p>As for the funding for primary education in various counties, in the past, local educational fund committees and other organizations had a somewhat independent nature. Since the implementation of the new county system in 1941, county finances have been centrally collected and disbursed, and the funding for national education has fallen from about 30-40% to 5%. The county budget for 1947 only listed central national schools, and the general funding for national education was left to the townships and Baos to raise themselves. As a result, the so-called "one school per Bao" plan in most rural areas was reduced to a dilapidated temple with a school sign hanging in front of it. This is the funding situation for basic education.</p>
<p>China's educational administration has always been characterized by the central government running higher education, the provinces running secondary education, and the counties running primary education. Therefore, the Ministry of Education will strive for university funding from the Executive Yuan, and professors are the leaders of culture, and students have the ability to stage strikes, petitions, and parades. The provincial education departments often concentrate their efforts on running secondary education, so the funding for universities and secondary schools, despite their difficulties, is still better than that for national education. The funding provided by the central and provincial governments to national education is extremely meager. The source of funding for basic education is the central government blaming the provinces, the provinces blaming the counties, and the counties pushing it to the townships and Baojia. It is pitiful that most townships and Baojia across the country have problems even with the office expenses for paper and ink, let alone running education! Therefore, when instructions are issued from higher levels, documents are submitted and returned, and plans and statistics fill the paper, all of which become empty talk. The people's right to basic education is deprived, elementary school students do not have the ability to cause school strikes, and most parents lack knowledge and have to let them fend for themselves. In some places, elementary school teachers earn only two Dou of rice per month, no wonder teachers have become a temporary haven for the unemployed. Where can we even begin to talk about the people's basic education!</p>
<p>Since the nineteenth century, education has been recognized as a right of the people. Whether it is our country's past constitution or provisional law, they all clearly stipulate that basic education is a right of the people and is free education. But in fact, most people have not enjoyed this right they should enjoy. Even in the areas of Beijing and Shanghai, which are known as the political, economic, and cultural centers of the country, it is extremely difficult for students to enroll, and in some places, free education often involves collecting fees.</p>
<p>In short, our country's basic education, whether in terms of "quality" or "quantity," is already close to bankruptcy. This is a huge hidden worry for the country. Without healthy future generations of citizens, how can the country talk about construction! As the Far East Regional Basic Education Conference is about to open, we must review the actual situation of our own basic education. We must present the rights of the people of democratic countries to basic education. We hope that people from all walks of life will regard national education as the center of gravity for national construction and strive forward.</p>

<h3>Indonesia Sends Note to United Nations Requesting Mediation of Dutch-Indonesian War; Sjahrir Ordered to Lobby Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 22nd: The United Nations Headquarters received a memorandum from the Republic of Indonesia today, requesting the United Nations to take appropriate action to intervene in the war between the Netherlands and Indonesia. At the same time, the headquarters also received a formal memorandum from the Dutch government, stating the reasons for the Dutch "security" actions in Indonesia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] Arab nations are scheduled to discuss on the 22nd the possibility of submitting the recent Dutch-Indonesian dispute to the Security Council with representatives of the Indonesian League here. As for whether the Soviet Union will take any action, there are no signs yet, and British and American representatives have expressed indifference to the issue of Indonesia being handed over to the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Well-informed sources here recently stated that a country in the Far East may bring the Indonesian issue to the United Nations Security Council, possibly China or India.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Singapore, 22nd] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir arrived here today from Yogyakarta. Sjahrir said that he was ordered by President Sukarno to discuss with world political leaders the best way to stop the Indonesian war. He will depart for India tomorrow and will also go to London and Washington to ask British and American leaders to use their influence to stop this shameful colonial war.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st] People here believe that Foreign Secretary Bevin may have discussed the issue of British and American mediation of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute when he met with US Ambassador Douglas today, but it is expected that at the current stage when the Dutch army has just begun its offensive, the Dutch government will not accept the suggestion of mediation by a third party. A statement from the British Foreign Office has already revealed that the British government's suggestion earlier this month to appoint a neutral police commissioner to resolve the issue of a joint police force between the Netherlands and Indonesia has been rejected by the Dutch government. Indonesia is very willing for any third party to engage in mediation and intervention.</p>
<p>Fighting Rages in Sumatra</p>
<p>[Our Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 22nd: The Republic of Indonesia issued a communique stating that the coastal artillery unit on the west coast of Java opened fire and hit two Dutch warships found off the coast. Indonesian troops are currently in contact with the Dutch Marines in eastern Java. Several Indonesian positions in Sumatra have been shelled by the Dutch, and the fighting is in full swing. Confirmed news reports that the Dutch army has occupied Sukabumi, south of Bogor and west of Bandung.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] The Dutch Air Force bombed the Republic of Indonesia's airport in Java on the 22nd, destroying ten aircraft. The Dutch goal on the first day has been achieved. The resistance of the Republican Army is weaker than expected. Some of the Dutch casualties were caused by landmines and ambushes.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 22nd] The Dutch army landed on the east coast of Java today and engaged with the Indonesian army. The Dutch army carried two tanks and five trucks and advanced twenty miles after landing. Before landing, the Dutch Navy shelled the coast for several hours to "soften" the coastal defenses. This area is the most prosperous region in Java, producing sugar, tea, coffee, and rubber. The Indonesian army on the Sambong front is still holding on and has made slight progress. Dutch aircraft also fired rocket artillery at the port of Cheribon.</p>
<h3>Dutch Army Uses American Aircraft in Combat; US Officials Express Extreme Dissatisfaction, Believing Dutch Have Made a Big Mistake</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] US officials are extremely regretful about the use of a large number of American aircraft by the Netherlands in the Dutch-Indonesian war. A senior official stated that the Netherlands has not received any US military supplies since the end of the war. During the Pacific War, the United States leased 40 fighter jets to the Netherlands for the purpose of fighting Japan side by side, but there were no bombers. If the Netherlands has obtained American bombers, it must have obtained them from other countries and not from the United States. According to other opinions, it is believed that the Netherlands actually possesses some materials from the US Lend-Lease Act in Indonesia, which should be attributed to the United Kingdom. When the United Kingdom withdrew from Indonesia at the end of November 1945, despite being informed by the United States not to transfer any military supplies to the Netherlands, the United Kingdom actually transferred the Lend-Lease materials to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Regarding the Netherlands launching a full-scale war against Indonesia, it is reported that officials here believe that the Netherlands has made a big mistake. Reliable senior officials believe that the result of the war will be the same as the Vietnam War, trapped in a stalemate, only able to occupy urban areas, while the countryside will be in the hands of guerrillas.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The State Department officially announced today after communicating with the ambassadors to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands that the United States government deeply regrets the recent outbreak of the Indonesian war, but is still prepared to negotiate economic assistance to Indonesia when an agreement is reached on the issue of a provisional government.</p>
<h3>Gillean Arrives in India</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 21st] British Special Envoy to Southeast Asia, Lord Gillean, arrived here this afternoon from Singapore. The Indian Governor's Office announced that Gillean's visit here is of a personal nature.</p>
<h3>Dutch Queen Delivers Speech Encouraging Military Personnel and Domestic Relatives</h3>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 21st] Dutch Queen Wilhelmina delivered a speech today to the domestic relatives of the Dutch army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers stationed in Indonesia, saying that you have husbands, sons, or fiancés in Indonesia, and you will face days of great concern and tension. All of our people have recently endured deep sorrow and hardship with a spirit of radiance and courage. I believe that we will pass this new test with the same spirit and courage. May God bless you all and your relatives in Indonesia.</p>
<h3>Australian Dockworkers Decide to Stop Loading Dutch Ships; Indonesian Member of Dutch Parliament Resigns</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 21st] The Secretary-General of the Australian Dockworkers Association said that due to the fierce aggression launched by the Netherlands against the Indonesian people, the ports of Brisbane and Adelaide have decided to temporarily stop loading Dutch ships until the situation becomes clear.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 21st] Indonesian Labor Party member of the Dutch Parliament, Pera, resigned today and announced his withdrawal from the party to protest the development of the Indonesian situation.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Hosts Reporters Talks about Korean Issue; Accuses US of Violating Moscow Agreement</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Head of the Soviet delegation to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, SitiKoff, hosted American and Korean reporters for the first time today. During the meeting, someone asked the head of the American delegation, Brown, whether it was true that the Soviet representative intended to exercise his veto power to prevent some Korean public groups from expressing their opinions on the establishment of a temporary unified government in Korea. SitiKoff replied, "There is no issue of veto power." When asked whether the interpretation of the 1945 Moscow Agreement on the organization of a unified Korean government seemed to have reached an impasse, and whether it could be resolved by a United Nations agency, SitiKoff replied, "There is no impasse that cannot be broken." SitiKoff also read a lengthy written statement, accusing the attitude of American representatives of violating the Moscow resolution and the recent discussions between Marshall and Molotov. SitiKoff said that the American representatives intended to solicit opinions from industrial and commercial groups, academic institutions, and other non-social groups, even fictitious groups. The Soviet Union advocated first consulting with groups that were not opposed by both the United States and the Soviet Union and that had more than 10,000 members each, but this had been rejected by the United States.</p>
<h3>North Korean Anti-Trusteeship Demonstrations: Many Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast: Colonel Ting (transliteration), Chairman of the Korean Committee, declared today that on June 30th, Koreans in Pyongyang and other cities in the Soviet-occupied zone held anti-trusteeship demonstrations, resulting in 400 deaths, 2,000 injuries, and 10,000 arrests by the Soviet side.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Advisor Cohen Resigns; Vacancy to be Filled by Bohlen</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] Cohen, Advisor to the U.S. State Department, has recently resigned.  Thus, the last representative of the New Deal under the leadership of the late President Roosevelt has also withdrawn from the U.S. government.  According to informed sources, Cohen resigned due to disappointment at failing to resolve difficulties between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The vacancy will be filled by Bohlen, an expert on Soviet affairs, fluent in Russian, and known for advocating U.S.-Soviet understanding. He previously served as an interpreter for the late President Roosevelt and President Truman. According to Bohlen, he is a left-wing non-communist.</p>
<h3>U.S. Pays Attention to Situation in Burma; Hopes for Peaceful Resolution of Political Issues</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd Dispatch]  The State Department spokesperson recently told our reporter that the United States is closely monitoring the situation in Burma following the political assassinations. Aung San was also among those killed. Washington officials have long viewed him as the future Prime Minister of Burma. However, the Burmese issue is of particular concern to the United Kingdom. Therefore, the U.S. government does not intend to make it a problem in U.S. foreign policy. However, the peace and order of Burma are also of particular concern to the American people. The U.S. government hopes that Burma can find a peaceful way to resolve its political problems so that it can achieve autonomy.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee told the House of Commons that after the Burmese massacre, he requested India's permission to use Indian troops in Burma if necessary.  So far, there has been no such necessity. The authorities have taken every step to provide reinforcements as needed. Burma is not yet a dominion government, so the United Kingdom still has the responsibility to maintain law and order in Burma.</p>
<h3>Arrested Suspects Increase to 300</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 21st Dispatch] Rangoon police continue to search for the murderers of the cabinet massacre, stating that they are "confident that they will capture all the murderers." To date, more than 300 suspects have been arrested. Seventeen leaders of the All Burma Trade Union today presented a blood letter to the executive committee of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, expressing their willingness to sacrifice their lives to eradicate the murderers and traitors who assassinated the great leader Aung San. When former Prime Minister U Saw, who was arrested, was escorted to the Rangoon Central Prison under tight police guard, the crowd along the way shouted "Kill him!" incessantly. Police also refused to confirm or deny reports of the arrest of another former Prime Minister, Ba Maw, who was a puppet Prime Minister under Japanese rule. After the war, he did not engage in politics, but after Aung San signed an agreement with the United Kingdom in one day, he led those who opposed Aung San, organized the "Independence First League," and condemned the constitutional assembly election in April. Police searched his residence yesterday and arrested his son-in-law, Ba Yan Nan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Accepts Soviet Proposal on Distribution of Atomic Energy Materials</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch]  At a meeting of the working subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today, U.S. representative Osborn declared that, in order to resolve the thorny issue of atomic energy and bring their opinions closer, the United States is willing in principle to accept the Soviet proposal to establish an international agency to distribute atomic energy, in order to establish an international treaty stipulating the regulation of the amount of raw materials and the quantity of nuclear fuel in each country.  Thus, the Soviet proposal for international distribution has been supported by the majority. The working subcommittee then discussed whether the international agency to be established in the future should own atomic fuel processing plants for industrial or military use, or whether it should only regulate them.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch]  The activities of the United Nations agencies today are as follows: The Security Council Membership Review Committee stated that the applications of Albania and eight other countries to join the organization were difficult to approve at this time. The Economic and Social Council approved Hungary's application to join the cultural organization by a vote of ten to one, with the United States abstaining. The Cuban representative proposed that Hungary be classified as a non-democratic country, treated the same as Spain, but the proposal was opposed by the Soviet Union and was not passed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Still Plans to Invite Britain to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; British and French Opinions Not Consistent with U.S.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 21st Dispatch]  Senior U.S. officials stated that the United States is currently pursuing a plan to convene a meeting in Washington to increase coal production in the Ruhr region. It is said that Marshall is unlikely to issue an invitation unless he believes that Britain will accept the situation. News from London can confirm this statement. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas emphasized the importance of this meeting when he visited Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 21st and still hopes for Britain's participation.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st Dispatch] Regarding the U.S. intention to increase German industrial production to a level far higher than that newly stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement, informed sources recently stated that Britain and France are very anxious about this. The French government recently submitted a note to the British government expressing concern about this U.S. intention. It is said that Foreign Secretary Bevin also informed U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas of Britain's anxious mood. French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Massigli reiterated France's views on the issue of German industrial levels when he met with Foreign Secretary Bevin recently.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Emphasizes U.S. Attitude Towards Germany</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st Dispatch] Regarding the statement made by Prime Minister Ramadier that he would do his best to obtain economic cooperation from the Soviet Union, semi-official sources here expressed agreement, but also hoped that France would formulate its future policy and not rely solely on the expectation that the Soviet Union would participate in the European recovery effort. Prime Minister Ramadier's statement that "the door is still open to the Soviet Union" to probe whether the Soviet Union is willing to participate is actually a warning to the United States on the German issue. This can be seen from the recent statements made by French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet. That is, if the United States and the United Kingdom take steps to raise German industrial levels without French consent, France's attitude towards the Marshall Plan will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>French Ambassador to the U.S. Meets with Marshall</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st Dispatch] French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet met with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall today and talked for 45 minutes. Afterwards, he told the press that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France may reach an agreement on various German issues related to the Paris Economic Conference, and the future is promising.</p>
<h3>Jewish Terrorist Groups Clash with Police; Holy City Scene Resembles Battlefield</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 21st Dispatch] After Palestine learned that the 4,500 Jewish illegal immigrants who were attacked in Haifa on Saturday had been sent back to France, the situation became very tense. Terrorists continue to operate throughout the territory, and a major riot seems imminent. It is reported that the unprecedented move to send Jewish refugees back to France has caused friction between the Palestinian authorities and the British Foreign Office. High Commissioner Cunningham strongly opposed this move, knowing that it would cause unrest in Palestine. The Jewish Public Assembly issued a stern declaration accusing France, which calls for equality and fraternity, of colluding with the United Kingdom to engage in such inhumane behavior. It also stated that the Jews will continue to work hard to immigrate to Palestine. Last night, the scene in Jerusalem resembled a battlefield. Thugs planted landmines near the police station and engaged in fierce fighting with the police. An oil pipeline between Haifa and Afula was damaged at noon, but the loss was fortunately not significant.</p>
<h3>Greece to Hold Group Defense Conference; Head of U.S. Military Delegation Also to Participate; Civil War Resumes on Crete</h3>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 21st Dispatch] The Greek National Defense Conference was held with the participation of Major General Leiford, leader of the U.S. military delegation, and Admiral Banaganburg, to discuss the issue of the size of the Greek army. It is also learned that four more members of the U.S. delegation have flown here from Washington, including financial representative Rossman, medical representative Saigel, health representative Heidley, and agricultural representative Holmgrem.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 22nd Dispatch] The government announced today that the civil war has resumed on Crete, while guerrillas are making sporadic attacks in other parts of Greece.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 21st Dispatch] Reports say that guerrillas, under the cover of Yugoslav machine guns, have invaded Greek territory from two places near the southern border. According to news from Thessaloniki, about 400 guerrillas attacked the city of Maurice but were repulsed and fled into Yugoslav territory, abandoning ten corpses. According to news from the Florina area received by the Ministry of Public Security, the guerrillas attacking Meso Horion and Messen Apostos both carried heavy weapons.</p>
<h3>French Compromise Plan Regarding the Balkan Issue</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcast Lake Success Dispatch: Regarding the Balkan issue, France recently proposed a compromise plan to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union. French representative Parodi stated in the Security Council that he had submitted amended provisions regarding the U.S. proposal to set up a semi-permanent border guard on the northern border of Greece, but the nature of the provisions was not disclosed. Prospects are promising that an agreement will be reached at the Economic Conference on various German issues.</p>
<h3>Harriman's Speech Explains U.S. Policy Towards Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman, who recently returned home after a two-week inspection in Europe, held a press conference here and stated that the issue of giving Germany priority in industry does not exist. This is only a matter of restoring Germany's normal European living standards in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The purpose of the current negotiations on German industrial production levels is to stabilize the import and export trade of the British and American occupation zones in Germany. The U.S. State Department, like the Department of Commerce, is also prepared to do everything possible to help achieve a balance in the import and export trade of the British and American occupation zones. At present, Germany's industrial production is only 38% of its pre-war level, while industrial production in France and Belgium has reached 90% of its pre-war level. The main problems facing Germany are coal and food. The current population of the British and American occupation zones is eight million more than before the war. Since the plan to import food from Eastern Europe has failed, most of the people in the British and American occupation zones rely on imports to maintain their lives. As for the coal problem, Germany's coal production has decreased significantly. On the contrary, although coal production in France and Belgium is not higher than in 1939, it is at least equal to that in 1939. The United States hopes to increase the supply of food and materials to Germany in order to increase German production. In short, the coal in the Ruhr region does not only represent German property, but also the property of the entire Europe.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Several Congressmen Discuss International Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st Dispatch] Marshall discussed the international situation with the House Foreign Affairs Committee and several congressmen today.

<h3>On the Eve of the Peace Conference with Japan, Prime Minister Katayama Calls for Unity; Indicates that a New Conservative Party is Not Likely to be Established at Present</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Prime Minister Katayama met with a group of reporters on the 22nd and made the following answers: (Question) With the peace conference approaching, what attitude will the cabinet take? (Answer) It is planned to deal with it with the current three-party cabinet. Because no matter what the opposition party or the people, their hope is to restore international credibility. Therefore, it is necessary to create a national situation in the country, demonstrate the fact of democratization, and welcome the upcoming peace conference. (Question) What are your views on the widespread rumors about a new conservative party, referring to the new conservative party of Yoshida and Shidehara? (Answer) I don't think a new conservative party can be established immediately. What preparations are being made for the peace conference? (Answer) It is necessary to frankly reveal the true situation in Japan and seek the understanding of all countries. (Question) What is your determination regarding the food problem? (Answer) How to make distribution smooth, even without distribution, is what the government is working hardest on. The suffering of a defeated country can be fully expressed in the food problem.</p>

(See photo, taken by this newspaper) Mo briefly stated: Seventeen years ago, the Japanese army invaded our Northeast, and the Northeast heroes organized the Righteous Army, rose up to resist, and laid the foundation for our country's victory in the Anti-Japanese War. The Righteous Army then fought in the Northwest and was also able to quell the rebellion and stabilize the interior. At that time, there were more than 20,000 people, who endured hardships. So far, there are only thousands of people left, which is very emotional. At this point, Mo choked up and shed tears. He continued: Today, the Righteous Army has received preferential treatment from the government, and they have been sent back to their hometowns. Along the way, various places have taken special care of them, which is very grateful. In addition to paying tribute to Chairman Chiang on behalf of the Righteous Army, I would like to thank all places and all sectors three times.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, in his capacity as the host, expressed his welcome to the Righteous Army and said that he had many feelings upon seeing the disabled, old and weak. He and the brave men of the Righteous Army have served the country for a long time and are true national heroes. Chairman Fang delivered a speech, saying that although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the Northeast is still in the midst of continuous warfare. He encouraged the brave men to continue to strive for the permanent stability of the Northeast by using the anti-Japanese spirit of Changbai Mountains and Heilongjiang after returning to their hometowns. Kong Xiangxi encouraged the Righteous Army to give play to the anti-Japanese forces of the past after returning to their hometowns, and to protect the prosperous and beautiful Northeast. Wu Yun Chu, on behalf of the business community, expressed his comfort and admiration. Gu Yuxiu explained the process of borrowing dormitories from Jiaotong University and Fudan University, saying that the teachers and students of the two schools expressed their welcome. Director Li of the Executive Yuan expressed that if there were any shortcomings in the food and accommodation and transportation of the Righteous Army, please forgive them.

The Righteous Army stood up and applauded in thanks. The conference ended at 6:30.</p>

<h3>Major Gunfight Between Police and Robbers in the 16th Ward: Two Robbers Killed, Two Captured</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] At around 8:20 pm last night, at No. 55 to 57 Limalu Road in the Nanshi 16th Ward, which is the Shuang Kaijian Qianxinghe Tobacco Shop, the shop doors were already closed when suddenly four robbers appeared. One was on the lookout outside the door, and three robbers entered in succession. One was wearing blue khaki trousers and a striped poplin shirt, carrying a travel bag. One was wearing a striped poplin shirt and trousers, and another was wearing a long gown. They pretended to be shopping and pulled out firearms. At this time, the accountant of the shop was opening the account, and all the legal currency of more than two million yuan was placed on the account table. The robbers were about to commit robbery when, fortunately, neighbors discovered the situation and urgently reported it to Police Officer Tong Qiyuan at Post No. 6384 at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Dongmen Road, and Police Officers Yin Fengchao and Zhou Kangnian at Posts No. 6303 and 6268 at the intersection of Limalu Road and Dongmen Road. Tong first rushed to the scene and kicked open the door. At that moment, one robber was about to rush out of the door and said, "Sir, don't get the wrong idea, we are here to buy goods." The police officer did not allow him to go out, and another robber standing inside suddenly opened fire with a gun. Tong dodged to the side and was lucky not to be hit. He also returned fire with one bullet, hitting the robber in the forehead. The robber fell to the ground and died. At this time, one of the robbers wearing a striped poplin shirt and trousers took advantage of the flying bullets to escape upstairs. Tong, seeing that one robber had been killed, bravely chased after the robber. As a result, the robber fled into a small room on the second floor and committed suicide with a handgun out of fear of punishment. There were five bullets left in the barrel, and ten more bullets were found next to him. At the same time, a robber at the door was running to Yang Songji's ground cargo shop on the same road, and the two police officers at Posts No. 6303 and 6268 rushed to intercept him after receiving the report, and finally captured the robber. At this time, Chen Jingshan, Deputy Chief of the Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau, also rushed to the scene in a car after hearing the report, leading Section Chief Zhou Nan, Inspector Xie Wanfu, Police Chief Cui Jinchuan, and police officers Qian Wumin and Li Jiafu, along with the righteous . The robber on lookout outside the door (named Ye Haichou, 24 years old, from Wenzhou) fled to the Bund ferry near the 16th Ward after the failure of the robbery and was intercepted by police officers from the Water Police Bureau and transferred to the Yimiao Police Bureau for investigation. Section Chief Zhou and others seized three handguns and dozens of bullets from the home of the victim. The bodies of the two robbers were later sent to the police hospital by car and then to the autopsy center for examination. In this operation, all four robbers were either killed or captured. It can be said that the net of heaven is vast, and no one can escape it.</p>

<h3>Land Rights of the Catholic Church: Registration Issue Temporarily Suspended: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Collecting Data for Research</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Catholic Church has purchased a lot of real estate in this city. Fan Erdian, the person in charge of the church, previously held documents to the Land Administration Bureau for registration. The Land Administration Bureau stated that the nature of the Catholic Church is different from other British and American churches. The Catholic Church is a world organization under the jurisdiction of the Roman Curia. Various countries recognize it as a member of the international community and exchange ambassadors with our country, but there is no treaty to obtain land rights, and it cannot be regarded as a Chinese church. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau cannot grant land ownership registration and has asked the Executive Yuan how to deal with it. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan had an instruction to Shanghai, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is collecting information and consulting with various agencies to study and handle the issue of drafting management measures for the Catholic Church. Before these measures are drafted and approved, the registration of land rights of the Shanghai Catholic Church should be temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>High-Altitude Luminous Body: Not a Balloon: Still a Mystery</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The story of flying saucers being discovered in this city remains a mystery. Recently, Mr. Fan Jiakang, a radio operator at the Jiangwan Radio Station, sent a letter to this newspaper proving that the luminous object he witnessed on the evening of the 19th was a weather balloon launched by the US military meteorological station. However, on the late night of the 18th, foreigners also discovered an object resembling a flying saucer. After investigation, it was found that the US military meteorological station did not launch any balloons on that day. Then, what is this luminous body? It is difficult to explain. A reporter spoke with Zheng Zizheng, Director of the Central Meteorological Observatory, yesterday, and Zheng believed that there were three possibilities: one is a weather balloon, which the US military meteorological station often launches; the second is a meteor, which can often be seen on summer nights; and the third is a secret weapon under testing. However, the possibility of the former two is greater. In addition to these, there may be some people who like to join in the fun and deliberately fabricate the story of witnessing flying saucers.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Shanghai Passenger Plane: Parts Damaged, Left in Qingdao: Special Plane Sent to Pick Up Passengers to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's XTT-81 Shanghai-Shanghai flight, which flew from Shanghai to Shanghai the day before yesterday, discovered that a certain part inside the plane was damaged and had to be replaced when it passed through Qingdao. The plane was left in Qingdao and grounded, and all passengers were taken care of by the company and spent the night in Qingdao. Yesterday, the company sent a special plane from Shanghai to transport the parts and pick up the passengers to Shanghai. According to a company spokesperson, due to the current foreign exchange situation, material supplies are difficult, and various parts cannot be fully purchased, nor can they be uniformly equipped at all stations along the line. When this situation occurs, another plane must be sent to replace it, resulting in a great financial loss and great inconvenience to passengers. This shows that the development of our national civil aviation industry is quite difficult under the current material difficulties.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Has Entered the Market: Loan Still Not Approved: Emergency Meeting of the Flour Industry: Representatives Elected to Make a Final Appeal</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association applied to the Ministry of Food and the Four-Organization General Office for a loan of 300 billion yuan of raw wheat two months ago to enrich the raw materials for flour production, increase public food, and alleviate the food panic. Although this application has been reported many times that it has been submitted for discussion and approved, the association has not yet received any clear orders from the competent authorities. Now that the new wheat has entered the market, if the competent authorities still transmit the documents through ordinary official channels, even if approval is granted, it will repeat the mistakes of last year's 30 billion yuan raw wheat loan, missing the opportunity and not benefiting anything. The association held an emergency meeting yesterday and elected Yang Guanbei, Xi Debing, Rong Yiren, Qian Zhonghan, Hong Qichen, Ren Zhuoqun, Wang Zhongjia, and Luo Zhongfeng as representatives to make a final appeal to the Four-Organization General Office today, to decide as soon as possible whether to lend, so as to cooperate with the government's general mobilization national policy and strengthen public food production. Otherwise, the new wheat will flow to other areas due to the shortage of funds in factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, which will lead to panic among the public, making it impossible to continue rationing, and once panic is formed, it will be difficult to remedy afterwards.</p>
<h3>"Watermelon, Watermelon!" This Year, Abundant Rain Has Significantly Impacted the Quality of Watermelons: Total Sales in Shanghai May Reach 50 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>Tangqi Watermelons Were Once Renowned; Pinghu Watermelons Have Followed</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] In addition to artificial beverages such as ice cream and soda, we must not forget watermelons as a wonderful product for cooling off in the summer. This year, there has been more rain, which has greatly affected the quality and quantity of watermelons. However, the weather is so hot, its consumption is still increasing day by day. Not many days ago, Tangqi watermelons were only 50,000 yuan per load, but yesterday they rose to 140,000 yuan, and demand still exceeds supply. There are about 100 or more watermelon wholesalers in the two fruit markets north and south of the 16th Ward and the Laozha Bridge. It is estimated that the average sales figure for each company this year is about 500 million yuan, totaling about 50 billion yuan. If calculated at 140,000 yuan per load, the consumption of watermelons in this city is 350,000 loads. With an average of 12 watermelons per load, there are a total of 4.2 million watermelons. With a population of over 4.2 million in this city, then each person can eat an average of one watermelon in a summer.</p>
<p>The watermelon rush still has one week to go, at which time 300,000 to 400,000 watermelons can arrive every day. Although the harvest is not abundant this year, the planting area has doubled compared to last year, so the total output has not decreased.</p>
<p>Everyone knows how to choose the quality of watermelons by tapping them with their fingers a couple of times, but more important is the skin color, especially the darkness of the yellow color of the bottom skin, which clearly tells you the age of the watermelon. Of course, the older and more mature ones are the sweetest. An old watermelon industry veteran told reporters that the planting land for watermelons should not be too old. The first year of planting watermelons on land that has never been planted with watermelons will produce the best watermelons. More than 40 years ago, the Sanbai melons of Tangqi Xiaolin were once famous, and later the San Tang and Daijiabang watermelons of Pinghu successively became dominant, especially the Daijiabang watermelons, which were crisp and sweet and could be broken with a finger. At present, the Sanbai watermelon from the south gate of Pinghu is considered the best, with yellow and loose flesh. Some have already arrived in the past few days. Unfortunately, there are not many. The quality of the South Gate watermelons has gradually deteriorated in recent years, and the watermelon throne is about to shift. I wonder who will succeed them.</p>

<h3>Taiwan-Shanghai Flight Detours to Fuzhou to Pick Up the Fujian Provincial Chairman to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hong Kong flights were originally scheduled to stop in Fuzhou twice a week. Recently, due to the newly promulgated inspection measures at Fuzhou Airport, the implementation method is still under discussion, so the company has canceled the stop in Fuzhou for two flights. Yesterday, Fujian Provincial Chairman Zhao Jianxu had to fly to Shanghai and then to Beijing on official business and had no plane to take, so he urgently telegraphed China National Aviation Corporation to send an additional flight from Fuzhou to Shanghai. Because the company's flights no longer stop in Fuzhou, in order to ensure that Liu could make the trip on schedule, it ordered the Taiwan-Shanghai flight to detour to Fuzhou today to pick up Liu to Shanghai.</p>

Car has also not been delivered, Chen Wenzhi and Zhang Liansheng falsely stated that it would take time to transfer the car ownership and that it must be donated around the tenth day of the lunar new year this year, and the car must be delivered at the same time. They also asked Senator Zhang to handle the prepayment of the payment flexibly, which Zhang refused. Later, Chen Wenzhi pleaded with Zhang, saying that he urgently needed funds at the end of the year and would issue a bill of 6 million yuan, and his friend Song Liangrui came forward to intercede, and Zhang agreed to issue the bill. Unexpectedly, time passed quickly, and the two repeatedly delayed on the pretext that the car was not delivered until March of this year, and the car ownership had still not been transferred and donated. Huai Yanming had to donate the car license within a week. When the time came, he again used excuses to delay. It was not until last month that Senator Zhang discovered that the old car license on the car belonged to another car and was an impersonation. Even if the transfer could be completed, it would be illegal. He then negotiated with Chen and Zhang, but Chen and Zhang have since avoided meeting him. Senator Zhang knew that he had been defrauded and that riding an unlicensed car was illegal, and he had no choice but to send the original car and the car license used to impersonate another car to the Laozha Police Bureau for investigation. Just when the Laozha Police Bureau was conducting an impartial investigation, Chen Wenzhi and Zhang Liansheng suddenly filed a lawsuit against Senator Zhang with the District Procuratorate, accusing him of dereliction of duty and demanding compensation of 30 million yuan. The investigation court opened yesterday, and Senator Zhang denied in court that he had demanded 30 million yuan. The prosecutor Yu then announced "release with a reprimand." The "defendant released on bail" reported in a certain evening newspaper was not true.</p>

<h3>Barber Instigates Strike: District Procuratorate to Issue an Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yang Jinsi, a barber at the Red Peony Barber Shop at No. 1513 North Sichuan Road, posing as the head of the barber industry union, arbitrarily increased the price of haircuts at the shop by 40% on May 11, from 7,000 yuan to 9,800 yuan. Yang claimed that the 40% increase belonged to the union, but in fact, he pocketed it all himself.

<h3>British Film Company Plans to Establish Its Own Cinema in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Film industries of various countries have recently launched fierce competition in the Far East region. To resist the dominance of Hollywood films in the Shanghai market, the British Odeon Corporation is planning to establish its own cinema in Shanghai, exclusively showing British-produced films.</p>
<p>According to an article written by Xun Tai'er recently published in the magazine "China of Tomorrow," British films that depict real British life can greatly increase the credibility of the British in China, promote cultural relations, and benefit both countries. Xun Tai'er also pointed out that British films, with their limited production, will focus on quality. It is even more necessary to prevent the export of inferior films to avoid adverse effects on Sino-British relations. In this way, there will be another competitor in the Chinese film market: British films.</p>
<h3>Preview Screening of "Fake Phoenixes and False Dragons" Held to Invite the Press for Observation: Barbers' Guild's Request for Prohibition Fails, Tension Once Rises in Front of the Theater</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The dispute between the Wenhua Film Company's film "Fake Phoenixes and False Dragons" and the barbers' guild is still pending after the Social Bureau invites various agencies to attend a preview screening and jointly review whether it should be revised or deleted. Wenhua Film Company is scheduled to host the press today at 4:00 PM to make a statement.</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation, the Shanghai Journalists Association specially obtained the consent of Wenhua Film Company and borrowed the film "Fake Phoenixes and False Dragons" for a screening at the Guanghua Grand Theater at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, inviting colleagues from various newspapers to attend. The barbers' guild learned of this and immediately sent representatives to the Social Bureau yesterday morning, requesting a prohibition of the screening. The Social Bureau stated that the film was borrowed by the Journalists Association from Wenhua Film Company for screening, and since it was done with the consent of both parties, the Social Bureau had no right to prohibit it.

<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Industrial Association held its twelfth meeting of the first session of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday afternoon to discuss proposals to be presented at the National Industrial Association's general meeting in the capital on the 24th of this month. More than 30 executive and supervisory committee members attended, with Chairman Wu Yun Chu presiding. Several important proposals were resolved, preparing to be submitted to the general assembly for approval: (1) Request to increase the number of National Assembly and Legislative Yuan representatives from the industrial sector to double the original allocation (originally set at 10 Legislative Yuan representatives and 18 National Assembly representatives). The government stipulates that handicrafts and motorized industries should be divided equally, but the Industrial Association believes that there should be no division. All organizations and qualified associations should have the right to be elected, and the government should cancel the restrictions. (2) Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, before the Sino-Japanese peace treaty is signed and the compensation issue is resolved, the government should be requested to suspend negotiations. (3) Regarding the allocation of import quotas, the competent authorities should promptly make rigid regulations on the allocation ratio between the industrial and commercial sectors. (4) Some of the machinery in the Japanese compensation is damaged and unusable. The Industrial Association should request the government to refuse to accept this type of machinery. The compensated factories must be complete sets, otherwise, other production equipment can be exchanged. (5) Regarding the opinions on the Industrial Association Law, a research group should be specially organized, and Ye Fukan, Jin Runxiang, Xue Huichen, Hu Boxiang, and Yu Mingyu, among others, are publicly recommended as members, with Hu Boxiang as the convener.</p>

<h3>Autumn Textbook Estimates</h3>
<p>Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Can Barely Cope: Remote Provinces Even More Deficient Than Before</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Education's statistics and estimates, the number of national standard textbooks needed this autumn is approximately over 80 million copies nationwide. The direct costs such as paper and printing required amount to approximately 100 billion yuan. According to the usual practice in the publishing industry, due to various reasons such as warehouse storage, store storage, book storage among industry peers, and transportation difficulties, if the goal of one copy per person is to be achieved, at least twice as many books must be prepared. The printing costs required will be even greater and must be accumulated year by year in order to gradually expand from near to far and ensure a sufficient supply. Previously, 11 publishers including Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, Zhonghua, World, Datong, Kaiming, Wentong, Children's, Chinese Culture, Duli, and Shengli, due to their responsibility for supply, still have a large number of books in stock. However, with the recent increase in wholesale from foreign ports, there is already a trend of supply falling short of demand. As for other publishing and printing industries with a narrow scope, due to the lack of paper and shortage of funds, no company has yet published any books. According to estimates from those familiar with the publishing industry, the current number of national standard textbooks on the market is less than one-third of the actual demand. Areas near Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang may be able to barely cope, but the shortage of books will be even more serious the further away you go. For places such as Taiyuan and Jinan, they rely on airplane transportation, while for places such as Dihua and Qinghai, they require camel transportation. In the past, during the era of the Seventh Joint Office, due to the responsibility, it was necessary to plan and supply as a whole, which was barely possible. Now that the contract with the Ministry of Education has been terminated, fewer people will pay attention to these remote areas, and the book shortage situation will be even more dire.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Ordered to Organize: School Affairs Reorganization Committee: Wu Baofeng's Resignation Approved</h3>

<h3>Special Points of the New Softball Rules</h3>
<p>- Wu Bangwei</p>
<p>Since the Organizing Committee of the 7th National Games decided to include softball as a men's event and plans to adopt the American "Soft Ball" - Soft Balt rules, the Rules Committee of the All-China Sports Federation has also made the same decision and is currently translating the rules approved by the American Amateur Softball Association in 1947 as a blueprint. Because the Softball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association is about to organize this league, it will first announce the special points of the new rules for practice. Except for the following points, the new softball rules are generally the same as the baseball rules.</p>
<p>(1) The length of the base line in the field is 55 feet, the throwing distance is 43 feet for men and 35 feet for women, the hitting area is a rectangle of 7 feet by 3 feet, and the catching area is a rectangle of 10 feet long and 8 feet 5 inches wide.</p>
<p>(2) The circumference of the ball is 11 and 7/8 inches to 12 and 1/8 inches, the weight is from 6 ounces to 6 and 3/4 ounces, the seams must not protrude, the bat length is at most 34 inches, and the diameter at the thickest part is at most 2 and 1/8 inches.</p>
<p>(3) Players can wear gloves and rubber-studded sports shoes, the length of the studs is at most 3/4 inch, the catcher should wear a face mask, and women should also wear body protection.</p>
<p>(4) The jersey worn by the pitcher should be all black or dark blue, and there should be no words or other decorations on the chest.</p>
<p>(5) Each team has 9 players. If there are fewer than 9 players, the game cannot be played. Replaced players cannot rejoin the game.</p>
<p>(6) The pitching method is underhand. The ball must be released when the wrist crosses the body, and the hand must be lower than the waist when pitching, and the wrist should be closer to the body than the elbow.</p>
<p>(7) If the ball is hit out of the field, if it is a high ball and flies over the fence or into the stands, if the distance from home base is more than 200 feet, it is a home run, otherwise it is a double. If the ball rolls into the stands or through the fence, it is a double.</p>
<p>(8) When a batter has "three strikes": 1. If the ball is caught by the catcher, he is out. 2. If there are fewer than two outs and there is a runner on first base, he is out even if the ball is not caught by the catcher. 3. If there is no runner on first base, regardless of whether there are outs or not, the batter can become a runner if the ball is not caught. 4. If there are already two outs, regardless of whether there is a runner on first base or not, the batter can become a runner if the ball is not caught.</p>

<p>(12) If a runner leaves the base before the pitcher releases the ball, he is out.</p>
<p>(13) From the time the ball is hit, when a runner advances, if there is a wild throw to first base, third base, or home base, and the ball touches an obstacle outside the field, or becomes an obstructing ball, the runner may advance one more base after reaching that base, and other runners may also advance the same number of bases. If the wild throw touches an obstacle or becomes an obstructing ball, each runner may advance as many bases as possible, but there is a danger of being stabbed.</p>
<p>(14) If a player, coach, or manager violates the rules, the referee shall immediately order him to leave the field, and he shall not enter the field for the rest of the game. Violators may also cause his team to forfeit the game.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs to Convene National Coal Production Increase Meeting on Schedule</h3>
<p>Strengthening Autumn Coal Rationing in Coordination with the Mobilization Order</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to strengthen the national coal rationing in coordination with the general mobilization order, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has scheduled a national coal production increase meeting on August 1. The heads of major coal mining companies across the country are successively reporting. According to sources concerned: This production increase plan, in North China, such as Kailuan and the northeast coal areas, in addition to planning to increase production on the one hand, it should still start with protecting roads and mines on the other hand, so that the increased coal can be continuously supplied to various places in the country for consumption. At the same time, it is planned that the area south of the Yellow River should achieve the goal of maintaining self-sufficiency. In order to prevent the coal supply in North China from being interrupted in case of emergency, the coal consumption in the south is still abundant. The main focus of the production increase plan for each base in the south will be in Yiluo, East China, Huainan, Xiangtan, and Taiwan. The production increase of the Yiluo coal mine is currently being actively planned by the Resources Committee, and it is expected to produce 2,000 tons per day. The coal produced in the area can supply consumption in various areas west of the Longhai Railway. The current daily output of the East China coal mine is about 1,200 tons. It is hoped that actively developing new coalfields will enable the coal from the mine to continue to supply consumption along the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. The current daily output of the Huainan coal mine is about 2,300 tons. According to the planned production increase plan, the daily output can reach more than 3,000 tons by the end of this year, and 5,000 tons by the end of next year. If the production increase of the mine is successful, it can be expected to fully supply the Nanjing area and the Xichang industry. The focus of Xiang coal production increase is near Xiangtan, and it is currently being planned by the Resources Committee. If the coal production increase in the area is successful, it can be expected to fully supply the coal needed by Hunan and Hubei provinces. The production increase plan in Taiwan is currently under negotiation. Taiwan Province claims that it can increase production by 1 million tons per year, but technical issues still need to be further planned.</p>
<h3>Coal Arriving from Various Places One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Area Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has seen a gradual improvement in the situation of coal arriving from various places in recent months. In June, a total of 150,000 tons of coal arrived from various places. This month, it is estimated that 120,000 tons can be loaded from Qinhuangdao, 50,000 tons can arrive from Taiwan, and 60,000 to 70,000 tons can be purchased freely by coal merchants. In addition, the bituminous coal ordered by the China Trust Bureau from Canada can also arrive at 30,000 tons recently. After the coal arrives in abundance, the committee's emergency coal reserves are also expected to be gradually replenished.</p>
<h3>After Continuous Declines, Shorts Cover and the Trend Has Improved</h3>
<p>Hua stocks rebounded yesterday. After continuous declines, shorts covered, but no new buyers participated in the middle. Xinyi suffered a sharp decline for many days. Yesterday, there was obvious maintenance, which was quite firm. Except for Xinhua's exclusive 10% decline, the rest of the small stocks, such as Xinguang and Jingfu, also tended to be popular in a short squeeze situation. The general trend has changed, or a small respite can be obtained. When the morning opened, the spot stocks were stable, and the deferred delivery stocks saw both rises and falls. After the deferred delivery of Maya opened at 477 yuan, No. 89, No. 23, No. 224, No. 19, No. 14, No. 133, No. 226, No. 60, No. 231, No. 110, No. 152, and No. 69 came in. Now Maya has risen to 498 yuan, and the deferred delivery of Maya has risen to 506 yuan. No. 157, No. 142, No. 76, No. 235, and No. 177 were sold, and after 9:30, they stepped down to 488 yuan. After that, No. 152, No. 154, No. 224, and No. 104 took advantage of the low price to absorb, while No. 157 and No. 223 sold, and started to spin, hovering until 10:20. No. 224, No. 19, No. 153, No. 78, and No. 61 saw eager buying, and the deferred delivery of Maya rose to 510 yuan. Now Maya reached 503 yuan. No. 32, No. 142, No. 85, and No. 223 entered the deferred delivery of Xinyi, and it also recovered to 3,170 yuan. No. 231, No. 73, No. 140, No. 94, No. 52, No. 69, No. 232, No. 104, and No. 132 sold one after another, and No. 223 even sold the spot Maya, forcing Maya to below 480 yuan near noon, and the deferred delivery of Xinyi was sold by No. 131 and No. 160 to the 3,000 yuan mark, Xinguang fell from 180 yuan to within 170 yuan, and Jingfu fell from 154 yuan to 146 yuan. Later, No. 180, No. 76, No. 112, No. 70, and No. 224 came in, and No. 223 suddenly came to cover, and the deferred delivery of Maya forced the 500 yuan mark near the close, and the deferred delivery of Xinyi was advanced by No. 169, No. 84, No. 207, and No. 45 to 3,120 yuan, and Xinguang Jingfu also ended at a high price. After the close, the deferred delivery of Maya was absorbed and raised to around 503 yuan by No. 237 and others. As a result, compared with the previous close, only Jingfu rose by nearly 10%, Xinguang, Maya, Xinyi, and Huafeng each rose by 5%, Xinhua fell sharply by nearly 10%, Zhongfa, Yonggong, and Qinxing rose but not much, and Guohuo was the same, Neiyi, Xinya, Cement, Jinglun, Datong, Shangping, Tongyi, Zhongsi, and Match each rose by 5%, mainly Zhongfang rose by 10%. For the deferred delivery stocks, Xinguang, Jingfu, Xinyi, and Huafeng each rose by more than 5%, and Maya and Yonggong only rose slightly. Among the old stocks outside the market, Huashang rose slightly, and the rest were weak.</p>
<p>Yongsha's off-site bid opened at 182 yuan to 185 yuan, a high price of 193 yuan to 196 yuan, a low price of 170 yuan to 181 yuan, and closed at a price of 190 yuan and 193 yuan. The interest rate is 1 jiao 6.5 fen to 2 jiao 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Stagnant</h3>
<p>The public price was very stable yesterday. The fluctuations of Tong Bing were very narrow. The opening price was 6,700 yuan, and it rose from 6,600 yuan to 6,900 yuan, and the closing price was 6,800 yuan. Room 360 and Room 503 sold, while Room 555 and Room 552 entered. As a result, compared with the previous close, A, B, C, and E each rose by 100 yuan, and Tong Ding rebounded by 200 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 1 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were very stagnant yesterday, and it was extremely difficult to obtain a transaction, which was very idle. Yisha opened at 66,000 yuan and rose to around 66,500 yuan to close. The narrow fluctuations are rare in history. Although retail investors bought, Hesheng tested, and as a result, Ye Guang slightly fell and the rest rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Allied Victory Public Bonds Are Being Bought Secretly</h3>
<p>At a time when US public bonds and US dollar short-term treasury bills are sluggish, some companies, firms, and individuals with financial resources in this city have been secretly purchasing Allied Victory US dollar public bonds issued in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. The original schedule for the lottery redemption and interest payment of the Allied Victory US dollar public bonds was all in US dollars. After the victory, in order to control and conserve foreign exchange, the government explicitly ordered that it be changed to pay in legal tender according to the US dollar exchange rate. Recently, there have been rumors that in order to restore credit, the relevant authorities will pay in US dollars to foreign bondholders who are abroad, and will still pay in legal tender to Chinese citizens. Therefore, some speculators are secretly buying bonds on the market, taking them abroad, and entrusting foreigners to come forward to request the Chinese government to repay the principal and interest in US dollars. This new trick of evading capital and obtaining foreign exchange by trickery is very thoughtful.</p>
<h3>National Cotton Stock</h3>
<p>1,142,000 Piculs</p>
<p>It is reported that the Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Joint Association of Machine Cotton Textile Industry Trade Associations, because the amount of national cotton stock is enough to affect the price of the cotton market, and the adjustment of cotton yarn raw materials has a close relationship. The association etc. carried out a national rural cotton survey in early March of this year. Because the flames of war are everywhere now, traffic often occurs in isolation, and estimation is difficult. Although the association etc. mobilized more than 400 people to work, the surface seems simple, but it is extremely complicated. Until June 20 of this year, it was estimated that some cotton areas in Shandong, Hebei, northern Jiangsu, and northern Henan were in special circumstances, and the numbers obtained were extremely incomplete. The numbers from Shanxi, Sichuan, and Liaoning provinces have not yet arrived, and all are missing. The reporter now records the numbers obtained by the association etc. as follows: Hebei Province stored cotton 2,119,000 piculs, Shandong Province stored cotton 143,000 piculs, Henan Province stored cotton 120,000 piculs, Shaanxi Province stored cotton 150,000 piculs, Hubei Province stored cotton 258,000 piculs, Hunan Province stored cotton 220,000 piculs, Jiangxi Province stored cotton 5,000 piculs, Anhui Province stored cotton 24,000 piculs, Jiangsu Province stored cotton 169 piculs, Zhejiang Province stored cotton 22,000 piculs, for a total of 1,142,000 piculs of stored cotton.</p>

<h3>Agent for Grinding Wheat Flour: More Than 50,000 Piculs of Wheat Have Been Received</h3>
<p>Fuxin Fufeng and other companies in this city are acting as agents for the government to grind flour, and the China Agricultural Bank has allocated 130 billion yuan in funds. According to the person in charge of the Gongji Office, which is jointly formed by the five factories, after the office started working last week, it immediately purchased raw materials in Shanghai in preparation for mass production. As of yesterday, more than 50,000 piculs of wheat have been received. The first step in the office's plan is to first purchase wheat in Shanghai and Wuxi, and then expand to purchase in Nanjing, Wuhu, northern Jiangsu, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and other places. It is expected to receive 2 million piculs of wheat every day, so that 3 million bags of flour can be produced every month. Each factory has also started agent grinding production, but has not yet fully resumed work. Once the wheat is harvested from all over the country and sent to Shanghai, the factories can regularly maintain a sufficient amount of raw materials, and each factory can produce 114,000 per month, which will reach the pre-war production level.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Cigarette Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw sluggish interest from all parties, with uneven absorption. On the market, ten-piece British cigarettes continued to be heavily traded, and prices remained firm, resulting in 8,760,000 yuan, a decrease of 90,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes were sluggish, with prices falling by 230,000 yuan to 7,320,000 yuan. The Five Flowers and Hademen market was also weak. Chinese cigarette brands such as Meili, Bai Wan, Jin Bailandi, and Shuang Fu all saw declines, but natural sales rose by 400 to 500 yuan. A large quantity of Tingjing cigarettes arrived by ship, but sales were slow, with 50-piece Jialike cigarettes falling to 52,500 yuan, a drop of 2,500 yuan. San Wu cigarettes plummeted by a significant 4,000 yuan to 42,000 yuan, while American goods showed mixed strength and weakness.</p>

To date, the Bureau has transacted 3,250 tons with domestic frozen egg merchants. Among these, 2,460 tons have already been shipped to the UK in succession.

<h3>China Trust Bureau Successfully Negotiates with MacArthur's Headquarters to Ship Sugar to Japan for Sale</h3>
<p>The Total Amount for This Year is 25,000 Metric Tons</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] In order to expand overseas trade, the Central Trust Bureau previously consulted with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, affiliated with the Resources Committee, to actively promote the export of sugar in order to earn foreign exchange. Considering that Japan consumes a considerable amount of sugar annually, which was previously supplied by Taiwan, the post-war demand for sugar is particularly high. Although the United States is famous for producing sugar, it has not been able to provide sufficient supply due to government restrictions. In view of this, the China Trust Bureau previously selected key personnel to go to Japan to negotiate with MacArthur's Headquarters. The negotiations have now been successful, and the Bureau has been approved to export a total of 25,000 metric tons of sugar to Japan this year. The deadline for delivery is the end of the year, and the selling price is US$0.15 per pound, with each metric ton valued at approximately US$300, totaling approximately US$15 million. The agreement stipulates that only "Zhongsha" (medium-grade sugar) is allowed. It is reported that the Bureau will formally sign a contract with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation within days. If there are no problems with the ships, the first batch of approximately 5,000 tons of sugar will be shipped to Japan by the end of this month. It is also reported that Taiwan Province has a bumper sugarcane harvest this year, and it is estimated that it can produce 300,000 tons of sugar this year and 400,000 tons next year. By the year 38 of the Republic, the area planted with sugar can be expanded to 118,000 jia (each jia is equal to 16 mu). The required fertilizer is 80,000 metric tons, which is currently being procured from domestic and foreign sources. Recently, 25,000 metric tons of sulfuric acid have been ordered from the Soviet Union, which will be shipped to Taiwan in batches for application soon. According to the recent decision made at the company's this year's sugarcane business discussion held in Taiwan, the previously agreed-upon sugar sharing ratio between sugarcane farmers and the company, with farmers receiving 48% and the company 50%, has now been changed to a uniform 50/50 split. Farmers are encouraged by this change and are more interested in sugarcane production.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw tighter credit among traders, leading many to sell, which caused Taiwan Sugar to fall by varying amounts of 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 yuan. The association's marked prices were 6.45 million yuan for 24 coarse white sugar, 6.1 million yuan for secondary quality, 5.3 million yuan initially for 20 medium-grade white sugar, and later 5.15 million yuan, and 6.1 million yuan for half-vehicle white sugar. Transactions of local sugar remained low, and the trend was still flat. Shantou Qing was 445,000 yuan to 437,000 yuan, Xinghua white bagged superior goods were 5.8 to 5.9 million yuan, secondary white in baskets was 5 million yuan, Xingchi was 440,000 yuan to 420,000 yuan, and Diaoging oil-wrapped was 370,000 yuan, with a total of over 200 pieces offered.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Teas Steady and Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign firms in the city, Wuchang Tea Company continued to consult with goods suppliers regarding low-grade aged black tea, so the situation remained strong. Other green teas, such as Chouzhenzhenmei, needed by Africa and Morocco, were mainly held firmly by the goods suppliers, so the situation was still characterized by more asking than selling, and the transaction volume was only sporadic, while the market sentiment became more stable and popular. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, street shops and various routes to Beijing and Hangzhou still saw sales, and in this situation, the active state was mostly similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Cloth Consistently Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw continuing soft sentiment in the market, with mediocre demand from all parties and sluggish actual sales from out-of-town merchants. The market was sluggish and lacked vitality. The closing price for 42-count Lan Feng was 17.2 million yuan, a drop to the bottom price, continuing to fall by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Shibi Ma was 11.5 million yuan, and Qing Shuang Ma was 10.5 million yuan, both falling by 200,000 yuan. The remaining 42-count Bingguang Shuiyue, 40-count Jincheng, 32-count Lan Feng, and 20-count Lan Feng Hong Feng tubes, and 16-count Guangming and other coarse and fine yarns, consistently fell by varying amounts of 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market remained weak. Buyers, due to the further decline in cotton yarn, had soft sentiment. Although yarn factories had an appetite for purchases, they took advantage of the weakness to suppress prices, causing sellers to be unwilling to release goods, and transactions became more subdued, with the market remaining stagnant. Lingbao cotton's highest opening price was 2.25 million, and the lowest was 2.12 million. Because this cotton is suitable for spinning fine yarns of 20 counts or higher, and recent actual sales of fine yarns have been sluggish, the price decline was more severe than for coarse yarns, so the price also had a small decline. Shashi opened at 2.18 million, and Jingyang at 2.2 million. Because this cotton is suitable for spinning 20-count and 16-count popular yarns, the price was uniquely resilient amid the weakness, so the high-end cotton prices have been very soft in recent days, while the trend for ordinary grades has been rising. The asking prices for factory delivery were 2.15 million for Lingbao and 2.16 million for Guide. The warehouse delivery prices were 2.12 million, 2.2 million, and 2.25 million for Lingbao, 2.18 million for Chongsha, and 2.2 million for Jingyang. Kuang yarn was 1.96 million, Guide was 1.975 million, Huo Ji was 1.73 million and 1.77 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 315,000 per dan.</p>
<p>Cloth</p>
<p>When the cotton cloth market opened in the morning, traders, due to excessively high interest rates on debts, all had the intention of selling. Guangzhou merchants continued to release goods at high prices. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth once fell to 428,000 yuan, but because the listing price for Fangjian sales was higher, the market sentiment turned stronger, and the closing price for Longtou fine cloth rebounded to 432,000 yuan, but still fell by 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Five-Fu, Caiqiu, and Lanji and other fine cloths also continued to fall by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Si Jia Zi, Jinyin Yuan, Taiwan, and Ba cloth, Hankou, slightly advanced, the market is firm. The remaining Pu Bu coarse cloth and Lanbu Shilin cloth, etc., had mixed rises and falls.</p>

<h3>Summer Fabrics are Falling Out of Favor</h3>
<p>Summer goods such as Palis, Fanliding, Feather Yarn, Nilo, Four-Nilo, Pangbie, Balene, White Giggy, White Straight Tribute, Gauze, Hemp Cloth, White Canvas, Baifu Nilo, and Hong Kong Luo are now falling out of favor in the market. Local and out-of-town merchants are mostly selling but not buying. The trend is sluggish, and prices are falling across the board. Those who have placed orders for delivery are seeing little profit, and some are even losing money after calculating the interest. Winter fabrics, such as flannel overcoats, are quite popular, as actual sales will begin soon.</p>

<h3>Dried Longan Falls by About 10%</h3>
<p>Recent sales of high-grade large-piece dried longan have been sparse, but it has been unable to maintain its stable position because the new branches are currently cheap. The market opened slightly yesterday, falling by about 10%.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Turns from Weak to Stable, Oil Prices Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 5,060 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The market sentiment remained weak when it opened in the morning. At noon, the shops took advantage of the opportunity to take in goods, turning the weakness into stability. As a result, japonica and indica rice saw little change, and sales in the North market were slightly more active, with a slight rise. Baimian, Yinmian, and Gaoding were flat and secondary was dull. Flour sales were sluggish, and factory flour fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands and Tong flour fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bran was stagnant, with little activity, and Xiu Shao was 300 to 500 yuan.</p>

Crude oil was weak at first and then popular, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean oil was stable, Qing oil fell back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, rapeseed oil also fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and digestion of cooked British oil was weak, falling by over 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil rose and fell suddenly, making it very difficult to predict. Because a lot arrived today and sales were stagnant, it plummeted by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Diesel Distribution Committee Begins Handling User Registration Matters</h3>

<h3>Wedemeyer En Route East, Visits Pu Chun, Head of the ROK Representative Group to China</h3>
<p>— A report by this newspaper's correspondent Zedejie</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st Fast Dispatch</p>
<p>Mr. Pu Chun, who has just recovered from illness, bears the marks of age and overwork on his thin face, recording his old struggles. His tone and manner of speaking fully express the determination of a revolutionary. Koreans over the age of fifty have had the hatred of national subjugation rooted in them since childhood. A life of wandering has made the desire to restore the country even more pressing. There is not a single diplomatic word in his conversation.</p>
<p>"Needless to say, our Korean view of the Soviet Union's policies is not favorable. Nor can we be satisfied with those of the United States. The kind-hearted people of Korea unanimously oppose the current state of affairs in which the weak are sacrificed in the conflicts between great powers. The United States should change this Far Eastern appeasement policy as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Korean Situation: Terror and Disaster Intertwined</p>
<p>"It has been almost two years since the victory, and the situation in Korea is getting worse day by day. Needless to say, in the North, the Korean communists who went from Yan'an and Siberia are the only political party allowed to operate by the Soviet Union. Their style is the same as that of the Chinese communists: struggle, destruction, and unlimited expansion of military force, creating unlimited terror and disaster. Culture and education have been suspended, and industry and commerce have been destroyed. The little bit of livelihood that remained after fifty years of squeezing by Japan has also disappeared. This situation has affected the South. Refugees are flocking in, discipline is lax, society is uneasy, and all industries are showing signs of decline.</p>
<p>"The South is an area where parties can operate openly, but the groups and individuals who have sacrificed and struggled for many years to lead the revolution have not received the attention they deserve. Under the rule of the American military government, the comprador class and hotel old-timers have risen to prominence. Relying on their ability to speak a few words of broken English, they take orders from the American military and use their power to oppress their compatriots. The common people are almost as miserable as before. The 'liberation' of Korea is only to sub-subordinate themselves to one master and become subordinate to two masters."</p>
<p>South Korean Communists: Unfair Democracy</p>
<p>"Are the South Korean communists active?" "Ah! Very active. Other parties cannot operate in the Soviet military zone, but the Korean communists can still do whatever they want in the South. This is the American way of democracy. Whether the Korean communists engage in sabotage or riots in the South, only the lower-level actors are subject to legal penalties. The leaders can still enjoy various guarantees and conveniences. This kind of unfair democracy has aroused understandable indignation among the people of the South.</p>
<p>"Speaking of a united government, there is not much hope for it at the moment. But fortunately there is no hope, otherwise, once the united government is formed, the Soviet Union will definitely suggest that the United States withdraw its troops together. What kind of situation the 300,000 armed Korean communists in the North would create in Korea, anyone can predict without hesitation. No one in the South is preparing for a civil war, but the North has long had the ambition to conquer the country by force. Therefore, before peace between the United States and the Soviet Union is thoroughly achieved, talking about a united government is tantamount to opening the door to thieves. Our Korean hope is to contribute to peace in the Far East after independence. Unexpectedly, now that the date of independence is far away, peace is even more hopeless. If Korea is forcibly annexed by the Korean communists, the Far East will be in turmoil."</p>
<p>Maintaining Equilibrium</p>
<p>Small Countries Greatly Sacrificed</p>
<p>He had no criticism of General Hodge, only saying that he was recommended by Stilwell. He regretted that Westerners understood Orientals so little, especially Americans who understood Korea even less. He criticized the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union:</p>
<p>"The contradictions and conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union are caused by their own ideas and systems. But instead of seeking improvement from themselves and coming up with methods to solve them, they are cutting flesh to heal sores on small and weak countries. The small countries of Eastern Europe are being sacrificed one after another, and the situation in China has also become awkward. As for our Korea, the Cairo Conference gave us a guarantee of independence, and the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference gave us a five-year trusteeship. This decision has no historical basis and is entirely for the purpose of maintaining their current equilibrium of power, sacrificing Korea in the process. We have had three thousand years of independent history and have the absolute ability and qualification for autonomy. In the past, we revolted to resist annexation and extinction. In the future, we will still not accept co-management. We are not a conquered country, we are liberated, and we also shed blood in the war against Japan."</p>
<p>He believes that the United States' policy in the Far East is too weak:</p>
<p>"We hope that General Wedemeyer can conduct a full fact-finding mission in Korea so that the United States' policy can become more active, which will truly benefit peace in the Far East and even the world."</p>
<p>Keen on Restoring the Country, Will Submit a Memorandum</p>
<p>Mr. Pu Chun is the head of the ROK Representative Group to China. There is no reservation in his conversation. The blood and tears of the Korean people are interwoven into an eager expectation of restoring the country. They attack any obstructing forces and unreasonable measures. When General Wedemeyer arrives in Beijing, they will give him a memorandum with extensive content.</p>
<p>Authoritative sources say that Wedemeyer's mission is equally important to China and Korea. Because in Korea, American and Soviet troops watch each other on a line, which has been made a dividing line between two ideas and systems, and even the front line of the two major conflicts and contradictions. Mr. Pu Chun said that if the Korean problem is solved, at least the situation in the Northeast can be simplified a lot due to the departure of the Korean communists. In fact, the focus of the China problem has long shifted to the Northeast. The 38th parallel not only concerns the fate of Korea, but also the peace of China and the stability of the world.</p>
<h3>Summer Scenery in Hong Kong</h3>

<h3>Hong Kong Residents in the Heatwave</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Zǐ Jiàn</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 17th Dispatch</p>
<p>Hong Kong residents seek respite from the heat, but they do not ascend Lushan or Moganshan; those who are qualified to speak of escaping the heat have long since built their retreats or villas on Victoria Peak or in the Mid-Levels of Hong Kong, or at secluded and scenic bays outside the city. When the heatwave strikes, they move their entire families there. Summer is a season of enjoyment for Hong Kong residents. Those who have villas on the mountains and coasts, and even ordinary salaried workers, go in groups of three or five to the public ice rinks by the sea to take a cool dip. Swimming is quite a popular form of entertainment in Hong Kong, akin to winter football, both being unique products of Hong Kong. Therefore, the swimming and football skills of Hong Kong residents are superior to those in the mainland.</p>
<p>The residents of Victoria Peak or the Mid-Levels are not ordinary families; they are at least of the "car-owning class," especially in the Mid-Levels, where the cable cars and buses are very far apart, and one must have a car to get around. Before the war, Chinese were prohibited from residing on Victoria Peak, but this prohibition was lifted after the war, and the residents of the Peak are no longer limited to foreigners. However, as of now, our compatriots do not seem to enjoy tranquility as much as foreigners do, and there are still not many yellow faces to be found on the Peak!</p>
<p>Victoria Peak in Hong Kong is the most successful undertaking of the British on that desolate island over the past century. I say this because it used to be a purely British residential area, and their undertakings, whether large or small, were all efforts for their own enjoyment. Therefore, even among deep mountains and rocky cliffs, the supply of water and electricity is not a problem, and the roads crisscrossing and connecting them are extremely convenient. The construction of roads and electric cable cars around the Peak is indeed a large-scale and practical construction project, which is also famous in the Far East, and many tourists from afar come to admire it. However, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, many of the Western-style houses on the Peak were destroyed by Japanese artillery, and the roads around the Peak were also marked with shrapnel, full of wounds. (There were also many Western-style houses that were dismantled by bandits for their wood, leaving only empty steel and concrete frames). The streetlights around the Peak, which resembled pearls before the war, have not yet been repaired.</p>
<p>Victoria Peak is more than 1,300 feet above sea level. The peak itself is 1,700 feet high, and a large barracks is built on its waist. Looking down from Victoria Peak, the entire city is in full view, and the Kowloon Peninsula is also faintly visible. Behind the mountain, one sees the connection between the water and the sky, white clouds and blue sea, which is thought-provoking. Victoria Peak is often foggy in the spring, and completely devoid of heat in the summer. The sea breeze blows in gusts, which is not common in other summer resorts.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is surrounded by water on all sides, and there are many natural beaches. The most famous is Repulse Bay Beach, and the most beautiful beach is Shek O Beach. As the sun sets, those beaches are filled with men and women. Many of them go into the water, but there are also many who come specifically to cool off and watch the excitement. The latter are members of the "beach gathering." Repulse Bay is behind the Hong Kong city area, about a 30-minute drive by car. The cost of the car fare and tent fee is at least five yuan per person each time, which is roughly equivalent to half a day's income for an average salaried worker. Therefore, they are fully capable of going there for fun once or twice a week. It is common to hear friends asking, "Where have you been swimming lately?" Regardless of how sluggish the Hong Kong market is, or how severe the floods in Guangdong are, regardless of whether they are car-owning or car-less, in this hot weather, Hong Kong residents always find a chance to soak in the deep green sea, inhaling the coolest air, because it is a season of enjoyment that is uniquely blessed to them.</p>

<h3>The Growing Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway</h3>
<p>— Staff Reporter Liáng Xiǎo Zhōng</p>
<p>Wuzhou, 17th Dispatch</p>
<p>War brings only unparalleled cruelty to the people. The unprecedented bloody battles of 1944 in Xiang, Gui, and Qian almost swept away all weak life on two thousand kilometers of land. This unprecedented catastrophe, starting with the Battle of Hengyang and Baojian, then fully unfolded on the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui railway lines. At that time, the tragic scenes of refugees running and shouting, calling for their children, wailing to the heavens, and stamping their feet, many people can still vividly recount. It was also in this great calamity that the two major blood vessels flowing into the Southwest with vitality—the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui railways—withered rapidly under the endless artillery fire and iron hooves, until they died. However, the vitality of the people can never be completely extinguished. From the retreat of the enemy cavalry to the victory of the war, after enduring a storm of wind and snow, the thousand-mile-long arteries were revived and grew stronger in the hands of the people.</p>
<p>The merger of the Xiang-Gui and Qian railways only occurred at the end of the thirty-fourth year, after the enemy surrendered. The construction of the Xiang-Gui Railway began as early as the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and was completed in the thirty-second year, running from Hengyang to Laibin in Guangxi Province, with a total length of more than 620 kilometers. The initial intention of building the road was to pass through Liuzhou, cross Yongning, exit Longzhou, and reach the Guangxi-Vietnam border, in order to obtain material assistance from allied countries, so its military value was higher than any railway. Unfortunately, within a year, Vietnam had been occupied by the enemy, and the war in southern Guangxi soon began. Therefore, the track-laying project from Liuzhou to the border was abandoned. In order to ensure the smooth flow of the Yunnan-Burma international route, the authorities began building the Qian-Gui Railway in July of the twenty-eighth year to handle the transfer of materials, running from Liuzhou to Duyun, with a total length of 460 kilometers. It was planned to connect the Duyun construction section, but the Zhouzhu battle broke out, and the enemy cavalry took advantage of the situation to directly attack the construction walls along the road. Most of Guangxi Province also fell to the enemy, and the entire line was completely destroyed, even the roadbed was dug up haphazardly. When the enemy began to retreat in November, the Ministry of Communications began planning the restoration work the following New Year. At the same time, Yuan Menghong was appointed as the director of the Qian-Gui Railway Bureau. Until September, when the enemy surrendered, the authorities, in order to strengthen the recovery work and quickly repair the Qian-Gui and Xiang-Gui railways, merged the two railways in December, renaming them the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, still with Yuan Menghong as the director of the Engineering Bureau. After the reorganization, it actively planned the full-line restoration work. At that time, many lost territories across the country were being recovered, and the railways in the southeast and central plains needed to be urgently repaired. Moreover, some people believed that the two railways had no significant economic value, so the matter was repeatedly delayed. There seemed to be many unpleasant things involved. However, the road could not be dispensed with, so the Ministry of Communications allocated more than 7 billion yuan in construction funds, expecting to complete the repairs in two years. However, after more than a year, only half of the repairs have been completed, and it has already cost a great deal of money. It is not easy to predict how much more money will be needed. Just the various locomotives require nearly 200, and there must be 3,000 freight cars and passenger cars. The locomotives currently being used for repair are only about 30. From this, one can imagine the magnitude of the expense. However, as the authorities are proclaiming the development of the Northwest and Southwest, we cannot help but believe that the government will definitely consider construction in addition to military affairs.</p>
<p>In the process from the resumption of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway's track restoration project to partial opening to traffic, the difficulties and hardships are numerous. Hearing it all at once, it seems that the revival of this road is simply a miracle in the history of transportation. The railway workers were able to overcome the lack of material resources with manpower under extremely difficult conditions. In a short period of just over a year, they repaired and opened to traffic nearly 500 kilometers of track, nearly 40 locomotives, and 70 passenger and freight cars, and were able to quickly rebuild various housing, machine plants, and other facilities. This cannot but make people admire the hard work of the labor heroes, the dedicated spirit of the staff, and the outstanding leadership of Director Yuan Menghong. Now let us look at some stories of "how people become giants," and we will deeply feel how difficult and valuable construction is, thereby admonishing those "heroes" who squander the people's blood and sweat with a single explosion of a landmine, and they should stop in time.</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway is over 1,100 kilometers long. Except for a small section of the Guichong section east of Dong'an in Hunan Province and 90 kilometers in Guangdong, the rest is mostly in Guangxi and Guizhou, and it can be said that most of it is in Guangxi Province. However, the geographical environment and human conditions in Guangxi and Guizhou have long been known for "no three miles of flat land, no three cents of silver for the people." Especially along the railway route, such as the 460 kilometers from Liuzhou to Duyun in Guizhou, it is almost entirely a malaria-infested area of mountains and ridges, with steep cliffs and precipices. The products are scarce and the population is small. How easy is it to supply the food and drink needed by a large number of railway workers? In addition, the Qian-Gui campaign of the thirty-third year saw years of war, and the essence of the local area had long been consumed by artillery fire. After the soldiers, there was famine and epidemic, the people's vitality was lost, corpses were everywhere, and travel was difficult. Therefore, the track restoration project was extremely difficult to carry out under all these adverse conditions. Over the years, many employees have died from disease and bandits. For example, during the initial rush repair of the Gui-Liu line, near Jiaobanzhou, an engineer was brutally murdered by bandits, and it is still an unsolved case. The remote and isolated guardhouses and sheds along the line have been repeatedly plundered by bandits. On the one hand, there are man-made disasters, and on the other hand, there are natural environmental constraints, such as the transportation of materials. It is not easy to utilize roads and waterways. There is a lack of road transport vehicles, and the costs are high, and the amount of transport is not large. As for water transport, the rivers along the railway line mostly lack convenient access for boats. For example, the Hongshui River in the Liu-Lai section, the Yongfu River in the Gui-Liu section, the Weirong River, and the upper reaches of the Liujiang River are mostly turbulent rivers with many rapids and rocks. News of accidents is common. It is heard that this spring, the Railway Bureau purchased a batch of sleepers from Baishou in northern Guangxi, with a cost of about 5,000 yuan per piece, but the freight cost was as high as 1,000 yuan. As for places where boats and cars cannot reach, such as the southern Guizhou area, they can only rely on ox carts and horse transport, and the power is even more insignificant. Moreover, just when the rush repair work was in full swing, last year and this year, they happened to encounter floods. Last year, the branch line from Liuzhou to Dawan was originally the section with the best rush repair results. However, when all the engineering was ready, it was hit by a flood, and the temporary bridges that had been built, such as the Buyuan River Bridge and the Dagou River Bridge, were completely destroyed by the flood, almost making it impossible to open to traffic. After repeated repairs, it was delayed for nearly a month before the first test car succeeded in mid-August, completing the first sound of the revival of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway in Guangxi. As for this year's floods, they are rare in decades, and the road restoration project has been further constrained. The important bridges on the Xiang-Gui line, such as the Liujiang Bridge, the Weirong Iron Bridge, and the Xiangjiang Bridge, are not only difficult to build, but even salvage operations cannot be carried out. The reporter traveled from Guilin to Liuzhou, and had to "change cars" at the Luorong River before reaching his destination. The Weirong Iron Bridge has been under construction for half a year, and there are still only a few piers. Speaking of this, I really sigh for this railway. From the section north of Hechi Nandan in Guangxi to Dushan and Duyun, the troubles of the journey are even worse than in Guangxi. The mountains are steep and the roads are dangerous. So far, the major tunnels in the territory, such as Dongshanping, Gumengguan, and Wenjiang Temple, have not been opened. On the one hand, there is a deadline to open to traffic, which is indeed a difficult task.</p>
<p>On the other hand, due to the scourge of the war, in the winter of the thirty-third year, the enemy invaded Guizhou northward along the Xiang-Gui line, directly approaching the construction walls. From Hengyang along the railway to Dushan, the severity of the disaster was rare in the country. The destructive work was due to the strategic needs of the national army, and then continued with the enemy's defeat and retreat. The bridges, tunnels, culverts, stations, locomotives, cars, and even the rails and sleepers of the two railways were all blown up and destroyed as much as possible. After the restoration, only endless stretches of yellow earth remained along the thousand-kilometer-long dragon, and occasionally discarded scrap iron and equipment were abandoned on the side of the road, which were sold by the disaster victims to make a living. Moreover, during the rush repair of the Changchong section of the Yuehan Railway, the more than 100 kilometers of track and equipment (which were laid during the enemy's occupation for military transport and were thus able to survive) remaining between Quanzhou and Hengyang on the Xiang-Gui Railway were completely dismantled to meet the urgent needs. Therefore, when Director Yuan Menghong resumed the new construction, he truly felt like he was on a "bald land," in a situation where even a single rail spike was hard to find. The great human power began to发挥 功能 [fāhuī gōngnéng] (exert its function), making up for the lack of tools as much as possible. The anonymous heroes working day and night in the machine plant used the simplest and most primitive tools to pile the abandoned locomotives, rock drills, water pumps, winches, and steel together from the barren mountains back to the plant, nailing, chiseling, cutting, and merging. Over the year, they left the factory, and the locomotives, car bodies, and cars with the glorious banner of "Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway No. X Rush Repair Team" written on them were as described above. Furthermore, the iron bridges in places like Guiliu, Yongfu, and Partridge River were almost completely dismantled and erected by hand hammers and pliers over a long period of time with both hands. The function of both hands was actually applied to the advanced transportation tool of the 19th-century atomic age. If this isn't a miracle, what is?</p>
<p>However, there are indeed many materials that cannot be handled by hands alone. For example, the steel beams of the iron bridge, the cement of the bridge piers, steel rail accessories, machine equipment, driving equipment, and even a small rail spike, all require reliance on foreign countries, and there is no other way. However, the import of foreign materials is difficult on the one hand and limited on the other hand (for example, the new locomotives recently distributed by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration [UNRRA] were not allocated to the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway at all). Often, the roadbed is repaired, but there are no rails, and if there are rails, there are no vehicles. It can be said to be extremely pitiful. At the beginning of the resumption of work, 100,000 barrels of cement were urgently needed, but the Ministry of Communications did not allocate them. It was only by relying on the 2,000 barrels of goods produced by the Guizhou Cement Plant in a month that they barely managed. Therefore, the work was delayed a lot. Now, although it can be transported from Guangzhou, and the UNRRA also has allocations, transportation takes time and money, which is still a difficult problem. However, once the floods pass, the temporary bridges are mostly unusable and must be rebuilt for long-term use, which is a very thorny situation.</p>

<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>Evil In-Laws Sow Discord, Loving Couples Find it Hard to Grow Old Together</p>
<p>Wang Xiuzhen, a local woman, was introduced to Li Jun, a fellow villager, for marriage last July. The couple's relationship was quite harmonious after marriage. However, the in-laws were malicious by nature and did their best to sow discord in the relationship between their son and daughter-in-law. They quarreled almost every day under various pretexts and treated her poorly in many ways, even attempting to harm her. Although no bad consequences resulted, there is conclusive evidence. For the sake of her own safety, Xiuzhen plans to return to her mother's home. However, she is constrained by her financial situation and does not understand the legal procedures, so she has to swallow her anger, endure humiliation, and shed tears of resentment, with no joy in life. Recently, her close friend Yuan Hedi sent a letter to this column, raising several legal questions and requesting the legal advisor of this column to answer them so that Xiuzhen can escape from the sea of suffering and regain her freedom. Here are her questions:</p>
<p>(1) Li Jun's parents (Xiuzhen's in-laws) are directly related to Li Jun, but they instigate discord in the relationship between their son and daughter-in-law. Do they bear any legal responsibility? Can a divorce be requested? (2) Li Jun's parents have a murderous intention towards Xiuzhen, but have not caused any bad consequences. Can they be charged with attempted murder? (3) If Xiuzhen wants to request to leave her in-laws' house, must she do so in the court of the place where she lives? (4) Xiuzhen's in-laws have committed heinous crimes. As a daughter-in-law, can she sue them in court? (5) Xiuzhen's in-laws have intentionally defamed her. Can she ignore them?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Ya Xia answers] (1) If Xiuzhen cannot bear the abuse of her in-laws, she can ask the court to order a divorce, and the other party bears the responsibility of "fault." (2) Since the "murderous intention" has not resulted in anything, it is considered an attempt. Unless it is murder or causes serious injury, they will bear the criminal responsibility for attempted murder or attempted injury. (3) Yes, the lawsuit should be filed in the court of the place of residence or the defendant's domicile, residence, or location. (4) If there is indeed such a fact, you can sue them. (5) Yes.</p>

<h3>Responding to the Shen Bao's Organization of a Fund to Aid the Surviving Families of Martyred Journalists</h3>
<p>The Jialin Scholarship Fund Board First Donates One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Reading the section in your newspaper about raising aid for the surviving families of martyred journalists fills us with deep emotion. The government's commendation of loyalty and the one-time issuance of a pension of 30,000 yuan is primarily focused on the spirit, and material assistance seems to depend on those of us who survived. We are now enclosing a check for one million yuan, specifically donated to Mrs. Zhu Xinggong to supplement the needs of her orphaned children, as a small expression of our sympathy, which is certainly insufficient to address the situation. We believe that there were more than just Mr. Zhu among the martyred journalists in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War, and there are many more surviving families in similar circumstances. We believe that there are many benevolent people in the world who can accomplish this righteous cause. With sincere wishes for your well-being.</p>

<h3>Arts and Politics</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>The relationship between art and politics has sparked debate in literary circles since ancient times, and a definitive answer has yet to be reached. Some proponents of art for art's sake want to transcend the political constraints on art and serve the interests of art itself; but is this possible? Humans are political animals; solitude is undesirable, and gregariousness is instinctive. Since people cannot live in isolation from the world, art as art cannot transcend and ascend to immortality. However, there is a considerable gap between the ideals and realities of politics. People's political ideals may well be far-sighted and ambitious, and they can even indulge in fantasies of a distant utopia to alleviate the bitterness of reality; but political work in practice is inevitably constrained by the realities of the environment, characterized by circuitousness, delay, waste of time and effort, lack of visible progress, and unavoidable stages. For example, the Soviet Union's "withering away of the state" and Sun Yat-sen's "Great Harmony" theory can be said to be lofty ideals. When the Nazi army was ravaging the Soviet Union, it had no choice but to launch the "Great Patriotic War" under the call of the government. To resist the invasion of Japanese militarists, China was also forced to strive for an unprecedented national defense war, which was entirely accepting the lessons of reality. Since harsh realities have befallen us, we cannot afford to cherish our feathers and indulge in illusory ideals.</p>
<p>Artists naturally need to have lofty ideals; but the urgent task of art is to grasp reality and reflect reality. Therefore, the subject matter and consciousness of art, that is, the content of art, cannot be detached from the real political environment to be self-admiring in one's own small world.</p>
<p>The content that art wants to express is nothing more than the "bright and dark" sides of real life; however, what we must pay close attention to is whether the writers' own stand is impartial, obedient to the truth, and solely dedicated to the interests of the nation? Can they truly fulfill the role of spokespersons for the people, boldly distinguish right from wrong, truth from falsehood, and guide the people from the sea of suffering in reality to the other shore of happiness, so that art workers never work for their own sake, never use art as a stepping stone, or use it to please the minds of the privileged class, or willingly become mouthpieces for a minority, making propaganda to deceive the people? Then, their praise of the light is to point out the way forward, and their exposure of the darkness is to reflect the light. People in politics should seriously consider and sincerely accept these well-intentioned suggestions and friendly criticisms.</p>
<p>Politics is a matter for all; every new measure in politics is closely related to the lives of the people. If the subject matter of art is not like the dreamy fantasies of romanticists and symbolists, but depicts life truthfully, then it will inevitably have a direct or indirect relationship with the implementation of politics, which is beyond doubt. Based on this decisive judgment, writers can choose not to participate in government work, and can even maintain a detached attitude, not being named in parties, groups, or associations, as a cell in a political organization; but they must closely monitor the implementation of politics as spokespersons for the people, pay attention to the party platforms and policies of various parties and their styles, and impartially urge the progress of politics; and thoroughly inform the public of the gains and losses, advantages and disadvantages that they can see through the use of skilled artistic techniques, so that the rulers of various parties, under the close supervision of the public, can only absolutely follow the aspects that are beneficial to the nation, try their best to demonstrate the achievements of their work to consolidate the party's credibility, and win the public's approval, and dare not violate the interests of the nation and destroy their political lives for their own selfish interests. Therefore, only art workers who transcend self-interest, discern truth from falsehood, distinguish right from wrong, and never cater to the world are satellites of the country, honest friends of political parties, and guides of the people.</p>
<p>The emotions of art workers are real, their conscience is pure, their ability to discern is correct, keen, and profound, and they spare no effort at all times to care about the future of the country and the suffering of the people. If there are writers who are good at speculation and opportunism, watching the wind and steering the rudder, conforming to bad trends, seeking personal false reputations, praising those who harm the country and the people as "progressive," cursing those who love the country and the people as "backward," and reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong, then what they write may be sold for a while, making the general public, who are blind and fond of elegance, taste it and forget its harm, and still take licking their wounds as an honor; but the eyes of the people are sharp. They see that the organic organization of the "country" has not yet withered, and their innate "patriotism" will never be diluted by these "progressive" masterpieces, and these "progressive" masterpieces will inevitably be submerged in the seabed under the tide of nationalism raised by another great era!</p>
<p>Furthermore, writers really need to have a political ideal as a standard for seeking subject matter; and formally participating in various political parties that have the same ideals is to accelerate the realization of political ideals, and does not hinder the freedom of writing; as long as it is not using parties and groups as a background to seek personal wealth, it will not harm the purity and dignity of artistic work. This means that art workers are the complainers of the people and the seekers of the implementation of ideals. If things that harm the country and the people happen in the parties and groups they participate in, it is tantamount to damaging their own beliefs, and they should uphold justice and give absolutely unforgiving corrections and criticisms. Only in this way can they give play to the tenacious spirit of art workers and lead the people forward! Lead the times forward! (July 11, 1947, in Chongqing.)</p>
<h3>Female Clerk</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>When I was in the mountain city, I can't remember which day it was, probably the third day after Clerk Wang was dismissed, a new person came to our section. A body with very disproportionate upper and lower parts, eyes sunken like rotten sores, and cheekbones towering high like two distant mountain peaks. Her hair was permed, and from a distance, it looked like a pile of dark clouds, a cloud of black smoke. She wore a pink shirt on top and a pair of snow-white slacks on the bottom, and on her feet were the most fashionable Hong Kong patterned leather sandals. In short, her dress was modern and urbanized. Her name was Chen Yanfang, which sounds very beautiful, and it is said that she came to fill the position of Clerk Wang.</p>
<p>That night (the night she came), some curious colleagues quietly went to the window of the section chief's office, which was also his bedroom, to eavesdrop, but the sound of the conversation was very low, so low that it was almost inaudible. So, one by one, the colleagues quietly walked away, as frustrated as a thief who had stolen nothing.</p>
<p>The next day, the section chief brought Miss Chen to the office to briefly introduce her to us. This introduction caused some surprise and attention from some colleagues because there had never been a female clerk in our section, and today Miss Chen was dressed so flamboyantly. When the section chief walked out of the office, the colleagues seemed to forget Miss Chen in front of them and began to discuss her; some said she was a vixen, some said she was a female demon, and some said she was very beautiful. I saw Miss Chen's face change from red to white, and the large amount of rouge still couldn't cover the freckles on her face. I really couldn't see where she was beautiful. I thought the colleagues were probably saying that her dress was beautiful!</p>
<p>She happened to sit opposite my desk, so I had more opportunities to talk to her.</p>
<p>She said that she loved literature and liked to write something in her spare time. She said that her articles were often published in a certain newspaper's "Literary Supplement." Obviously, she was somewhat proud of being a writer. At the same time, she said that she also loved music and had participated in several grand concerts. Her grand theory on music was that music can cultivate people's temperament. ... She envied the civilization of the city. What she cared most about the mountain city was whether there were cinemas, cafes, dance halls, big restaurants, or... I gave her a "no" answer to all of these. Immediately, I saw that she looked very annoyed, frowning, and muttering in her mouth. I seemed to hear her scolding herself for why she had to run to this remote and backward mountain city. Finally, she took a deep breath! Alas! How boring this life will be!</p>
<p>She said that when she was in Chongqing, she had never left the movies for a day. She could rattle off a series of stars such as Deanna Durbin, Jeanne MacDonald, Tyrone Power, Gary Cooper... I saw that she had a strong interest in the names of these people.</p>
<p>From the section chief to the workers, she treated everyone equally. No matter when, her face was always full of smiles. I had never seen her angry. I thought this person was probably very optimistic!</p>
<p>But there was one time when she really got angry.</p>
<p>That was one summer evening. We were all sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool and chatting. The mischievous Xiao Zhou played such a joke on her. "Miss Chen, how old are you this year? Are you still unmarried?"</p>
<p>So she roared and scolded Xiao Zhou loudly, and then went to bed alone.</p>
<p>Every day she could receive an average of three or four letters, registered, express, or... Therefore, her main job every day was not the official documents of the section... but dear little pigeons! She patiently answered their letters separately. Sometimes I saw her laughing at the letters she had written, but I didn't know what she was laughing about.</p>
<p>Suddenly one night, Xiao Zhou ran to me and said that Miss Chen was leaving. As for why she was leaving, no one knew.</p>
<p>"Maybe she's going back to Chongqing to see a movie," some colleagues teased her.</p>
<p>"Maybe she's going back to Chongqing to get married," some colleagues speculated.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she left the next day. Before leaving, she came to see me once. Finally, she said a sentence in a foreign language that I didn't understand: "So long, I hope that I could see you again," wriggled her two large hips, imitating the demeanor of a foreign movie star, and left gracefully.</p>
<p>Half a year later, I went to Chongqing. One day, I accidentally saw Miss Chen walking hand in hand with an elderly man on the street. I saw that her belly was bulging high. I asked myself in surprise when Miss Chen got married and became pregnant so quickly. She walked steadily with her legs apart, and her bulging belly floated in the air like a balloon. I deliberately walked towards her. I saw that she was a little embarrassed and wanted to avoid me, but I stopped her.</p>
<p>"Ah! Miss Chen"!</p>
<p>She nodded slightly to me. The old man looked at me with displeasure. I was just about to step forward and say a few words to her, but the old man dragged her away like Xiao En in "The Fisherman's Family".</p>
<p>I watched the two unharmonious figures of the old man and the young woman gradually disappear before my eyes.</p>
<h3>Misty Rain</h3>
<p>— Lü Zhuang</p>
<p>Gazing at the rainy scenery is indeed enough to trigger reverie,</p>
<p>Especially the misty willows by the roadside, the wind is strong...</p>
<p>I dream of the days when the sun shone like wine,</p>
<p>In the depths of the shady garden, the cuckoos call out,</p>
<p>Your and my names, one sentence more urgent than the last...</p>
<p>My mind and eyes are soaked in the misty rain,</p>
<p>A faint ink painting cannot disturb the heavy homesickness;</p>
<p>Today I am stationed in this sinful city,</p>
<p>The flow of time has only taken away from me a string of empty days;</p>
<p>Spring goes and spring comes, no one will have the slightest feeling!</p>
<p>Gazing at the rainy scenery is indeed enough to trigger distant reverie,</p>
<p>I dream of the misty rain season in my hometown,</p>
<p>Farmers lead water buffaloes, cuckoos skim across the sky,</p>
<p>Green rice seedlings, long ridges,</p>
<p>Together with the charm of the field women, are all depicted in the misty rain.</p>
<p>I should go back! I should take advantage of this misty rain sail,</p>
<p>Come to your team, put on the straw sandals of the past,</p>
<p>Grasp the anemic hand with the anemic hand!</p>
<p>Let us lean shoulder to shoulder, gazing at the mountain gap,</p>
<p>A corner of blue sky is shining; a corner of flag is fluttering!</p>
<h3>Returning Sail</h3>
<p>— Monet</p>
<p>Claude Monet (1840–1926) was a painter who became famous for his "Impression, Sunrise," which was rejected from the Salon in 1863. The name "Impressionism" is based on this painting of his; and this name was not a praise at the time, but a ruthless sarcasm. However, Monet eventually succeeded, and has been included in the glorious page of art history, hailed as a revolutionary painter of the era, and the leader of Impressionism.</p>
<p>His works are mostly landscapes, and this is a representative work. (Liu Shi)</p>
<h3>Shakespeare Sonnet</h3>
<p>— Zhen Le Tentative Translation</p>
<p>Sonnet 64</p>
<p>When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced</p>
<p>The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;</p>
<p>When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,</p>
<p>And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;</p>
<p>When I have seen the hungry ocean gain</p>
<p>Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,</p>
<p>And the firm soil win of the watery main,</p>
<p>Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;</p>
<p>When I have seen such interchange of state,</p>
<p>Or state itself confounded to decay;</p>
<p>Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--</p>
<p>That Time will come and take my love away.</p>
<p>This thought is as a death, which cannot choose</p>
<p>But weep to have that which it fears to lose.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 356</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Look at the way he walks, like an oriole hopping, one step forward, then a limp, it really is not pleasing to the eye. Furthermore, the secret work he is doing at this time, according to himself, this "getup" is a "disguise"; inconspicuous, not attracting attention; in the eyes of the Japanese and puppet secret agents, it is just a small, down-and-out household; it cannot be said that he is an anti-Japanese student.</p>
<p>These past few days, how he has eaten and how he has slept, I don't know. But that small, long, round face is still red in the black, and his two small arms are still so round and bulging, not a bit thinner. His face still has a silly and cunning smile.</p>
<p>"Have you found Aunt Ji?" Yin Jun told me that Little Tiger was looking for Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"I just came from Aunt Ji's place, and also Mr. Wu and Team Leader Shen. Aunt Ji said she wouldn't come here, and asked me to accompany you there... It's about ten miles away, you can go by car or on foot."</p>
<p>Walking on foot is certainly not as effortless as taking a car. Moreover, since I am appearing here as number fifteen, walking is more troublesome than taking a car; because there are too many Japanese "sentries" along the way, and the procedures are too many, it is better to drive straight through than to go through the formalities. (The car is affixed with military symbols).</p>
<p>The car was driven by me, but the route was guided by Little Tiger, left turn, right turn, and in a blink of an eye, we arrived at a place that looked like a small village. Under Little Tiger's guidance, I was told to park the car at the foot of a big tree. In the car, Little Tiger kept looking around, checking for "sentries". This is where he is meticulous and cautious. Getting out of the car, he was still not at ease, looking back and listening again and again, determined that no one was following, and that no sentries were paying attention, he then said commandingly: "Old man, let's go!"</p>
<p>"How much further?" I asked him casually.</p>
<p>"Not far; mountain paths and field ridges, the car can't go... We'll be there after crossing two more small hills. Let's walk slowly, old man." He was considerate of the disability of my two legs.</p>
<p>Okay. "Not far," one hilltop, then another hilltop; according to my calculation, it was at least five or six miles, and all of them were small roads, mountain paths.</p>
<p>On the road, I repeatedly questioned him, "What have you been doing these past few days?" "Where have you been?" "When did you find Aunt Ji?" He always answered vaguely, cleverly diverting to unrelated matters. I felt that he had some unspeakable secrets, and must be somewhat disappointed; so I stopped asking, and only told him some of my experiences.</p>
<p>"We're here!" Standing on a small hilltop, Little Tiger pointed to a forest in the small valley; there seemed to be several thatched cottages in the forest. "Look there, old man." He raised his hand and pointed to the west end of the opposite small hill, a distant point. I tried my best with my five-hundred-degree nearsighted eyes, but couldn't see anything; so I took out my binoculars and focused on the point of light.</p>
<p>It turned out that the blurry place I was looking at just now was about a thousand meters away. Along the foot of the north mountain, there was a highway, winding to the foot of the north mountain, near the foot of the mountain, there was a bridge. Looking at the east end of the mountain again, that highway went straight through, all the way to the distant mountain gorge.</p>
<h3>Church Bells</h3>
<p>— Shi Bei</p>
<p>Living in this mundane and noisy city for a long time always feels depressing. The best, most beautiful, and quietest place here is this corner of the church.</p>
<p>As summer deepens, the paulownia leaves around here are even more lush and green, with branches and trunks towering into the sky. Next to it is a light green wooden fence, and the ground is covered with velvety green grass. Roses and those small trumpet-like slender flowers are dotted around the ground like a crown. In the middle of the bushes, a brown-red church stands out, with a white cross erected on the roof, radiating sparkling white light. The silk shade and red house reflect each other under the azure sky. All of this carries a suppressed melancholy and an expectant emotion in its solemnity—when a cool breeze blows, gently shaking the paulownia leaves all over the trees, rustling and resounding, the surrounding vastness arouses a slight tremor, which further deepens the color of this mood.</p>
<p>This church is located in such a city—where the gap between rich and poor is the most obvious, the struggle for fame and wealth is the most intense, and evil and vanity are the deepest... Compared with this, the church is obviously a sharp satire. But precisely because of this, I love to walk here, slow down my pace, and wander by the low green fence. I love to see the red walls exposed in the middle of the green shade, I love to see the silver-white brilliance emitted by the cross...</p>
<p>I have heard the church bells in this church. They are clear and bright, but also sorrowful and subdued. Every chime of the bells weighs heavily on me. This was originally to lead all living beings to the realm of loyalty, love, and supreme goodness; Christ was nailed to the cross in order to wash away the sins of mankind, and many martyrs were able to rest in peace with this bell sound. People made confessions and prayers to create new days. This is the earliest revelation that the bell sound gave people.</p>
<p>Listening to the bells, I thought of an old English female pastor who led me to pray a few years ago, reciting beautiful verses in a low voice, and thinking of how she taught me to listen to the appeal of this bell sound to the human spirit. But now this can only evoke a trace of memory. I watched evil greedily growing everywhere, and there was clamor and noise everywhere; in this city, the ferocity of carnal desires was even more exposed, and people were frantically pursuing power and money. Reality gave me too many lashes, and I sighed for the old kind soul and for those kind and forbearing people!</p>
<p>Naturally, I still love this church and love to hear these bells. Yesterday I walked over there again. This time, listening to the rising and falling mournful bells, each chime evoked more sighs from me. As I walked, I listened to the bells slowly and continuously ringing. However, in front of me, I still couldn't stop. The shouts and scoldings in the city, and the atmosphere filled with dust and malice. In the past, I had placed unlimited hopes, expecting this bell sound to sternly rebuke the sins of the penitents, and to use emotion to proclaim the sacred and demonic nature of humanity. Now I have temporarily shelved such wishes.</p>
<p>In the years to come, day and night will follow each other, and the bells of this church will continue to ring forever, but how do the people in this city feel about these bells? I hope that one day, while waiting for the bells to ring, the melodious and gentle sound waves will make my mood soar, and from then on I can rest in the sea of loving and mutual assistance, with no more treachery and evil.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Dismissing Professors</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>Recently, rumors have been circulating everywhere that certain university professors will be dismissed; the University Professors Friendship Association in this city has also held several meetings for this reason.</p>
<p>This rumor can now be denied. Because the university is a sacred place for academic research, professors on the one hand cultivate talents for the country, write books and establish theories, and on the other hand lay the sacred foundation for Chinese culture and science.</p>
<p>In order to cherish China's few academic talents, university professors should be given extra care so that they can teach with peace of mind; in these years of war and chaos, create an academic atmosphere for China.</p>
<p>The conversation with Vice Minister Hang Zheng of the Ministry of Education further confirms that what we see is not a fallacy.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Hang said that the Ministry of Education has never authorized any university to dismiss professors!</p>
<p>This statement is so straightforward and frank. Who can still doubt that the dismissal of professors has been authorized?</p>
<p>Vice Minister Hang said that university presidents have full power to hire professors, and the list of professors that each school intends to hire does not need to be sent to the Ministry of Education for review. This means that each school has the freedom to hire professors and is absolutely not subject to any restrictions.</p>
<p>This explanation will clarify the rumors that are circulating in various universities at present, which is worthy of our joy and excitement.</p>

<h3>The Invisible: America's New Navy</h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy is currently undertaking its most significant peacetime mission in history, which is to join forces with Britain to safeguard global trade routes. According to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, there are as many as three hundred "active" warships participating in this non-combat operation—because it is, in fact, a rehearsal for an "invisible naval war."</p>
<p>The so-called "invisible naval war" is not an imagined operation for a future great war: this term truly represents the entire naval strategy of the United States from now on. In other words, the United States is currently implementing a major plan to transform its most powerful navy of all time into a large fleet of "super submarines."</p>
<p>This plan has long surpassed the "ideal" stage. According to a report in the Washington-published "U.S. News," the Navy Department is requesting Congress to authorize the construction of 4,000-ton experimental submarines, and Congress has already allocated 30 million U.S. dollars for this purpose. Half a dozen completely new types of submarines have already been designed; and a considerable portion of the 4.428 billion U.S. dollars in the 194_ fiscal naval budget will be at the disposal of the "undersea warfare strategists."</p>
<p>To glimpse some of the truth about the "new American navy" that is taking shape, it is necessary to first dispel existing notions about the size, function, offensive power, and cruising range of underwater vessels. The submarines used in World War II are almost as obsolete as the old warships that Admiral Nelson used to defeat Napoleon's combined French fleet.</p>
<p>New "battleships" and "aircraft carriers" will be extra-large submarines. The former will be equipped to launch missiles and rockets—and to carry out large-scale coastal bombardments. The latter will have spaces to accommodate aircraft and decks for launching jet-propelled planes, as well as carrying large groups of "Marines" for landing operations.</p>
<p>Even new methods of transporting jet-propelled aircraft under the sea are being studied, or may be considered obsolete, because the increasing improvements in missiles and rockets will render pilots useless or relegate them to the position of observers.</p>
<p>The work undertaken by "PT boats" during World War II—such as harassing enemy transport ships, reconnaissance, raids into harbors—will also be borne by underwater vessels. These will be mobile, small submarines that can slip into estuaries or pass through harbor defenses to place timed atomic bombs.</p>
<p>Even transport ships and supply ships will navigate underwater to reach remote bases. Naval Department designers believe that this vital auxiliary force, if it remains on the surface, will become the weakest link in the offensive and defensive strategy of the atomic age.</p>
<p>In the "invisible naval war" strategy, perhaps the most revolutionary feature is its anticipation of using atomic energy to propel underwater vessels, making their speed similar to that of the fastest surface vessels today. According to the Washington correspondent for the "Chicago Sun," G. Penkrowd, this plan "has already undergone detailed study, and according to scientists and naval leaders, it is not as far from full realization as most people think."</p>
<p>Due to this detailed research, the use of atomic energy to propel warships may be realized sooner than those predicted "non-military" uses—such as propelling locomotives, powering factories, and heating water for city residents.</p>
<p>According to J. Minnefer, a reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," the U.S. determination to "submerge its navy" has clearly been spurred by two post-war developments. The first is the discovery of German submarine models from the end of the war, which were far more advanced than any submarines the Allied nations possessed at the time. If the enemy had completed their "snorkel" submarines and new torpedoes earlier, the outcome of the war might have been very different.</p>
<p>The second factor is the "atomic bomb tests at Bikini," which have shown that submarines are less vulnerable than surface vessels.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the fact that the number of submarines lost in combat was less than that of any other type of vessel.</p>
<p>The lessons learned at "Bikini," as well as those from the study of captured German submarines, are now being incorporated into the design of American "super submarines"—including a type of torpedo equipped with a "proximity fuse" that will explode even if it does not hit the target.</p>
<p>According to Rear Admiral C.W. Stayer, the Navy Department's "undersea warfare strategist," tomorrow's undersea warship "will not merely be a surface vessel capable of submerging, but a full-fledged, true undersea vessel. It may well become the primary weapon of naval warfare tomorrow... This is the age of atomic energy, and also the age of true submarines, which can remain underwater for months on end without needing to surface periodically to recharge their batteries."</p>
<p>As for the American vessels that will remain on the surface, their equipment will prioritize submarine detection instruments and anti-submarine weapons. This indicates that surface vessels will primarily be used to support and protect underwater warships in the future. These surface vessels will also be unrecognizable in shape and structure compared to today's warships. They will be faster; their superstructures will be reduced to near zero, making them less visible; and their hulls will be built to better withstand atomic bomb blasts.</p>
<p>The advocates of traditional "giant battleships" will probably continue to clamor among naval leaders for years to come. However, all indications suggest that current U.S. naval plans greatly diminish the usefulness of battleships in atomic warfare. Only two battleships are currently in service: the "Missouri" in the Atlantic Fleet and the "Iowa" in the Pacific Fleet.</p>
<p>The battleship "Kentucky" and the battlecruiser "Hawaii" are both being converted into vessels for launching missiles and rockets.</p>
<p>When the U.S. Navy launches its "invisible naval war," it will not only be the "elders" in the naval community who will have to acknowledge that they are "outdated" and reform their thinking.</p>
<h3>Old Madame Xu</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>People today often use the phrase "Old Madame Xu, still full of charm" to describe the beauty of a woman in her twilight years. In reality, Old Madame Xu was only twenty-four years old. In the past, this would have been considered middle-aged, but today, she would be considered among those "whose plum blossoms are still on the branches," and should not be hastily labeled as "middle-aged." Moreover, some mistakenly believe that Old Madame Xu was the mother of Cao Cao's 徐母. This not only leads to the accusation of misattribution but also detracts from the virtuous reputation of a wise mother. For the sake of clarification, I respectfully present the relevant information from the "Southern History: Biographies of Empresses and Consorts."</p>
<p>Southern History: Consort Xu of Emperor Yuan of Liang was beautiful and fierce. She started with the Emperor in Xiangdong. After the Emperor ascended the throne, he made her a consort. She was ill at ease in the palace and often had affairs with attendants and Ji Jiang, a petty official from Piaoyang. Although the Emperor knew of this, he feared her fierceness and did not dare to ask. Before this, the Emperor was wounded by an arrow in the eye during the suppression of Hou Jing's rebellion, losing sight in one eye. Whenever Consort Xu knew the Emperor was coming, she would only apply makeup to half of her face to await him. When the Emperor sought her out, she would be greatly angered and leave. Sometimes, he would order her to sing, and she would sing "My Vague Sentiments" in response. The Emperor was displeased by this and did not visit her for years. The Consort believed she had succeeded in her plan and became even more promiscuous. Jiang told others, "The horse of Liyang may be old, but it is still potent. Old Madame Xu may be old, but she is still very amorous." Later, she offended the Emperor and was deposed.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Emperor Yuan did not not love Old Madame Xu. However, she constantly offended him, so he had to bear the pain of cutting her off.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>There are quite a few Americans who claim to be experts on China. After gaining a superficial understanding of the Four Books and Five Classics, they start to show off their ignorance and even write books and articles. When mentioning the "Book of Rites," they invariably cite "Men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving." One female student even asked me on a public bus, "If it's really true that men and women shouldn't touch hands, then what do couples do?" I told her that there were separate rituals for couples, and she finally understood that there are also handshakes, embraces, and kisses in China. America also has a book similar to the "Book of Rites," called "Etiquette," which is a grand view of things, even including the format of invitation cards. But if you follow the rules in the book, it may not work in America. Americans usually don't send out invitations for gatherings other than grand banquets; a phone call is enough. There are many customs that are not included in the American etiquette books, so I am writing them down here for self-funded students who are about to go abroad as a reference: When you are walking with a girlfriend, you walk on the street side and let her walk on the side near the buildings. After crossing the road, change direction and immediately switch positions. If you let the woman walk on the street side, she will definitely think that you are intentionally insulting her, because that means you are treating her like a prostitute. If the two of you walk into a restaurant or other place and there are flowerpots or other obstacles blocking the way at the entrance, when she walks on the side with the flowerpots, you cannot walk on the left side of the flowerpots. This will cause an argument because American women are very superstitious and you should pay special attention. If you love her, you should tell her you love her every day, otherwise she will get angry and accuse you of forgetting a phrase. When you sneeze or yawn, you must say "Excuse me," otherwise she will protest that you forgot another phrase. After she kisses you, don't immediately wipe off the lipstick with a handkerchief in front of her. You should wipe it off when she's not paying attention. If she says her feet hurt after walking into a movie theater, that's another way of telling you to take off her shoes for her. American women like to use their own forks to pick up food and put it in your mouth in front of other guests. If you are too embarrassed to accept it and refuse to eat, that is extremely impolite. American women like to swear. When the conversation gets heated, they will swear. You have to go with the flow and quickly give in, otherwise she will cry and you will have to apologize. When you go to America, you have to learn how to whistle. Whistling and applauding are both ways of praising beauty. The person you whistle at will not only not be angry, but will also turn around and smile, saying "Thank you." (26)</p>
<h3>Scientific Essay: The Sky Dock (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Gu Junzheng</p>
<p>If mankind can avoid atomic warfare, then we will surely be able to create a sky dock, to serve as a starting point for spacecraft traveling to the moon.</p>
<p>Even if atomic energy is used in spacecraft, and there is no need to add fuel en route, the sky dock itself has many appealing and useful features that are worth our efforts.</p>
<p>What can support this sky dock in space? This is the first question that anyone who hears this plan will ask. At first glance, it seems impossible, but in reality, its principle is very simple.</p>
<p>Imagine a high mountain, with its peak standing in space. On this peak, there is an imaginary cannon. We know that the horizontal range of a cannon varies with the initial velocity of the bullet. If this initial velocity is extremely high, then it may even circle the Earth and have the possibility of shooting back at itself. This initial velocity is approximately five miles per second, and is called circular velocity, because an object shot out at this speed can continue to circle the Earth indefinitely.</p>
<p>Why doesn't this object fall to the ground? The answer is: It is not that it doesn't fall, it just never falls to the ground.</p>
<p>Don't you understand what that means? Then you can think of it this way: Any bullet that is fired will simultaneously be making two movements. The first movement is due to the initial velocity from the muzzle; the second movement is due to the attraction of gravity. These two movements combine to create a curved trajectory.</p>
<p>If the initial velocity of the bullet is greater, then the curvature of the trajectory will be flatter. If the initial velocity is increased to a certain limit, it will be possible to make the curvature of the trajectory match the curvature of the Earth's surface. At this time, although the projectile continues to fall towards the ground, because the rate at which the Earth's surface curves downward is exactly the same as the rate at which the projectile falls due to gravity, it will never fall to the ground.</p>
<p>When any projectile is shot out along the tangent of the Earth, if its speed reaches five miles per second, the above phenomenon can occur. It is impossible for a cannon to create such an initial velocity, and even if it were possible, it would not be of any use to us.</p>
<p>However, it is possible for a spacecraft to create such an orbit around the Earth at a height of 500 miles, and this is much easier than traveling to the moon. Once the spacecraft is in this orbit, it does not need to consume any more fuel, whether it circles the Earth once, twice, ten times, twenty times, or countless times. Only when the pilot wants to return to Earth will fuel be needed. At this time, the fuel consumed is used to reduce the speed of the spacecraft, causing it to fall into the atmosphere and make a landing. Such an ideal will surely be realized before lunar travel. After this ideal is realized, we can use sixty-eight tons of fuel to bring one ton of equipment to this orbit, and then build a permanent sky dock there.</p>
<p>Once this dock is built, then not only will lunar travel become easier, but also transportation between other planets. Because, first, at an altitude of five or six hundred miles, the gravitational pull of the Earth is very small, which is a special convenience for the spacecraft's progress. Second, at an altitude of five or six hundred miles, the air is very thin, and the spacecraft has almost no air resistance to overcome. Third, the dock itself already has a speed of five miles per second relative to the Earth, so if the spacecraft departs from here, it can increase its speed by five miles per second compared to departing from the Earth.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Fire</h3>
<p>— Qiyuan</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a fire in the world after World War II. To what extent will this fire spread? Will it eventually spread to every corner of the continent, or will it be submerged by the vast sea? This is not something that today's clever people can predict. Those who have studied chemistry know that the composition of a fire has three parts: a core, an inner flame, and an outer flame. Therefore, the American international affairs writer CFestet Duller also divides the Soviet fire into three parts (zones): core, inner perimeter, and outer perimeter.</p>
<p>The core zone includes the land of the Soviet Union at the time of its founding in 1917, and the various republics that later joined the Soviet Union, as well as northern Finland, southern Finland's area with direct access to the Baltic Sea, the three small republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the northern part of East Prussia in Germany, the eastern half of Poland, the eastern part of Czechoslovakia (the so-called Czltpztbo-Uktzide), Bessarabia and Bukovina in Romania, Gangladuvan, southern Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and even the Turkish provinces of Kars and Erzurum are likely to be close to this zone.</p>
<p>The inner perimeter zone includes all areas close to the core zone that, while not yet considered part of the Soviet Union, are under Soviet military control, such as Poland in Central Europe, eastern Germany, eastern Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania. In Asia, Outer Mongolia, the Changchun Railway Zone in northeastern China, Dalian, Xinjing, and northern Korea, etc. Recently, it may also extend to Greece, Iran, Turkey, Kurdistan, and southern Korea.</p>
<p>As for the outer perimeter zone, because it is farther away from the core, direct action cannot be taken. Therefore, three methods are adopted for independent countries and colonies: (1) In colonies, encourage revolution and independence movements. (2) In independent countries, collude with the communist parties of those countries. (3) If there is no communist party or left-wing presence, encourage left-wing factions.</p>
