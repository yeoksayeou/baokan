<h3>參會分組審查提案大部工作今可竣事　和平提案日內開始審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕參政會廿九日竟日舉行分組審查會，並由外長王世杰，財長兪鴻鈞分別在第二·第四兩審委會報吿外交·財政，各組分別草擬審查報吿，同時進行審查提案計七組，一日間共審查提案二七一件。關於軍事國防者十七件，關於外交國際者尙未審查，關於內政者六十一件，關於財政·經濟者五十六件，關於敎育文化者四十四件，關於交通晨林者五十五件，關於救濟者廿四件，關於社會者四件，關於合作者二件，關於醫藥衛生者四件，關於司法行政者四件。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電」參政會廿九日分組審查提案，各組審查委會，廿九日上下午分別召開會議，審查各部會首長之工作報吿及有關提案，茲誌各組廿九日審查情形如次：（一）第一審查委會，王澤民主席，出席委員三十一人，審查行政院工作報吿。關於國防部分，當推定張之江，官褘，梁上棟，趙雪峯，吳滄洲及該組召集人起草審查報吿。下午審查有關軍事國防提案，計十七件。（二）第二審查委會，上午周覧主席，出席委員三十四人，首由王外長世杰報吿外交情形，並推定陳博生（召集人）周議冲，范予遂，張維楨，馮今白，審查外交報吿。下午陳博生主席，到委員廿二人，審查有關外交提案計八件。（三）第三審查委會，上午許孝炎主席，到委員四十三人，審查有關內政，地政，蒙藏等提案計廿四件，下午黃宇人主席，到委員卅二人，審查提案卅八件。（四）第四審查委員會上午鄧飛黃主席，到委員六十二人，審查財政，經濟，糧食等提案，計廿三件，下午陳豹隱主席，到委員卅六人，審查提案卅三件。（五）第五審查委員會上午蕭一山主席，到委員四十四人，審查敎育報吿，推定許紹棣，顧頡剛，雷沛鴻起草審查意見，並審查提案十六件，下午黃炎培主席，到委員四十一人，審查提案十四件。（六）特一審查委會，上午由張振鷺，鄒樹文輸任主席，審查有關交通，農林，水利等提案廿六件，下午甘家馨主席，到委員十八人，審查提案廿九件。（七）特二審查委員會，，江一平主席，到委員十四人，審查關於救濟之提案廿四件，關於社會福利者四件，關於合作者二件，關於醫藥衛生者四件，關於司法行政者四件，共卅八件，該組下午未開會。</p>
<p>〔又電〕參政會各組審查委會，卅日繼續開會，審查提案。據悉：各組審查工作，大部分卅日可望結束。卅一日起將續開大會，討論提案。又關於為審查和平問題提案組設之特種委員會，俟其他各組審查工作吿一段落。即將召開審查會。</p>
<h3>軍事國防工作　參政員提出改進意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕際蘇國家邊疆防務尙未鞏固，地方秩序尙在紛亂之際，若干參政員對於軍事國防工作，已提出重要改進意見，據參加廿九日第一審查委會之某參政員語記者，一般意見着重於下述七點：（一）整軍方針，應予改變，以應目前需要。（二）針對軍隊弱點，力求改善。（三）充實地方武力，力謀與軍政配合。（四）各種撫卹，應切實辦理。（五）對於廿五萬餘之退役官佐，應迅妥善安置。（六）軍校學生應儘量錄用。（七）哈爾濱應迅圖收復。關於第一點，渠稱：彼等咸主整軍方針應為力謀精兵主義之實現，且充實其質量，對於整編之進行，應充實原有部隊，提高素質，加强訓練，以精神·政治·物質之動員，配合軍事力量，而期達成任務，不宜稍存地域派別之觀念，而作整編之取捨。關於改善弱點，咸主增加軍費，改良待遇，剔除積弊，糾正軍風紀，注意指揮官之能力及聲望。軍官佐退役者，均對抗戰有功之將士，應迅予資助回籍，令地方政府予以工作機會或生產之補助。至哈爾濱問題，該地原為我國東北之門戶，現已被共軍佔據，作爲補給之孔道，對東北軍事局勢影響甚大，在審查會上，曾提出詢問並討論，咸盼政府迅謀收復，以斷禍源，而慰人民之渴望，此項意見，即將請大會通過，轉請政府採納施行。</p>
<h3>改革幣制問題　須待大局安定後實行　參政員包一民請辦文化貸款</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕財長兪鴻鈞廿九日出席參會第四審查會報吿政府財政措施時稱：改革幣制，更換幣制單位，須待大局安定之後，惟政府對此已有準備，如冒然改制，將來通貨仍膨脹，政府不能樹立信用，亦無補於事。因改制之先，政府必須換取充足之外匯也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕參政員包一民，頃為當前文化有低落之勢，認為國家亟應辦理文化貸款，扶持出版事業，以提高我國文化水準，促進社會進步。包已擬就提案送參政會，其辦法數點如次：（一）由政府命令國家行局，設置文化貨款。（二）貸款對象分出版界及著作者兩種，以有聲譽及其著作認為有出版價値者，得申請貸款。（三）貸款利率及期限，比率工業貸款或優於工業貸款。（四）著作人出版借款及手讀，應儘量放寬。</p>
<h3>行總中共人員拒轉參會邀電　聯絡中斷說並非確詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕中共派駐行總工作人員，以「解總」駐滬辦事處名義答覆參政會，謂烟台行總電台與任何中共電台並無聯絡，拒絕拍發該會邀請中共參政員赴京之電報，據某政治觀察家語記者，此不過為中共不願出席參政會，拒絕恢復和談之藉口，實際並不如此。因查中共電台近日廣播均有烟台消息，如本月十五日廣播中有「烟台市工商業發展極速報道」，廿二日有「烟台市外匯日來猛烈下跌」及「烟台市工商業」等電訊，無論該項電報自魯境何處發出，可見烟台與中共總台，聯絡迄未中斷，自上海致中共參政員之電報，間接仍可轉達，中共留滬人員所謂轉電一節無法從命之言詞，不帝爲欺人之談也。</p>
<h3>莫德惠仍在休養</h3>
<p>渠希望能赴東北一行</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫德惠仍在中山醫院休養，血壓已見降低，精神尙佳，對記者表示：晋京日期未定，一切取決於健康情形。離京多日，與時事隔膜，須與各方商談後，始能有所主張，但和平與統一不可分，孰先孰後，僅為技術問題。莫氏渴望於體力恢復後赴東北一行。並謂：東北問題關係甚大，二次大戰即發源於東北，致力於內政問題之解決，即可解決東北問題，至以國際關係而論，則國與國之問，有「交」必有「涉」，不必過於重視。論及和談時，莫氏稱：列席參政會為時恐已不及，希望與各參政員在滬一叙，恢復和談事不簡單，並非一人或一方面之事。</p>
<h3>民社黨組織委會推徐傳霖爲府委</h3>
<p>徐氏已表示接受</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨宣傳部長徐傅霖，昨經該黨組織委員會決定，推舉為國府委員，徐已表示接受。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨組織委員會，昨上下午均開會，由戢翼翹，胡海門分別主席，通過刷新黨務，調整人事等提案多件。對於孫寳剛，盧廣聲，在世銘等之破壞黨紀及參加革新委員會之黨員，均一致通過開除黨籍，並根據該黨組織法第五條之規定，交中央監察委員會查明辦理。又關於組織委員會出席法定人數問題，亦經決議依第二屆組織委員會大會之前例，以圍內委風人數之過半數為法定人數。該黨定今日上午召開監察委員會，確定開除之人數，午後續開大會。</p>
<h3>設計考核處組織條例通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕國府設計考核處組議條例，經立院多次審查討論後，終於廿九日立院三二六次例會中通過。此次所通過之條文，其最大更動處，為將原第一條規定該處職掌項下所列關於政治經濟之設計與考核等事宜，改為「國家施政之設計與考核事宜」，法制委會委長劉克儁說明審查經過時，曾謂：該案前在大會及審查會討論時，各立委咸認該處係為主席幕僚機構，且關於經濟政策之設計，另有全國經委會主其事，故有如上之更動。此處較大變改處，為將原來數目相當衆多之職員數，盡量减縮。根據今日通過三組織條例，國府設計考核處將設設計局，考核局，秘書室等二局一室，置設計考核長一人，設計局局長副局長各一人，老核局局要副局長各一人。</p>
<h3>工會法修正通過　對限制罷工一項已刪去</h3>
<p>本報南京廿九日電〕工會法修正案，經廿九日立院三二六次例會激烈辯論後，業已完成立法程序。該法全文六十三條，提出後，首由勞工法委會召集人諶小岑說明本法要旨，略謂，本法經此修正，工會開始有全國性組織，至工人加入工會事，草案不採登記制，而採許可制，對罷工問題，草案規定公用及交通事業工人不得罷工，並親定在罷工期內不給工資。繼即開始討論，多數立委對罷工問題僉認不應限制過嚴，主張將第廿八條最後兩款關於罷工之規定删去，孫院長亦認對公用及交通工人罷工事不應予以禁止，蓋此種規定實與現代潮流不合，且違反民主原則，並舉例說明法律若禁止公用及交通事業工人罷工，則對煤礦等動力工人罷工事應如何處置？若僅禁前者而任令煤礦工人罷工，豈非矛盾？立法貴乎適應時代精神，上述兩款以删去為宜。陳顧遠等亦認罷工人應仍于工資，以示體恤。最後決議將兩款删去，其他各條無大更動，即全案通過。（工會法全文刋卅一日第七版）</p>
<h3>立法院竟日會議　修正內部組織法批准中美空運協定　農長列席報告工作槪况</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院三二六次例會因議案過多爭辯激烈，廿九日竟日舉行，九時半開會至一時散會，下午三時半續開至五時許始散；兩次會議均由孫院長主席，出席立委百餘人。上午會，左部長舜生曾列席答覆有關農林質詢，本日通過要案十件，主要者為：（一）國府設計考核處組織法，（二）工會法修正案，（三）修正印花稅法，（四）修正內政部組織法，（五）中美空中運餘協定，（六）中阿友好條約。會中對立委職業代表名額等問題，亦曾加以討論。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立院廿九日晨舉行第三二六次例會時，新任農林部長左舜生，對該部工作概况，作簡略報吿，略謂農部所附屬機構共有四十餘個，以限於經費人力，工作未能盡如理想，然若干機構，由於人才配合得宜，雖經費支絀，仍有相當工作表現，京滬等地棉業機構，即其例證。左氏認為農林工作，若僅從生產着手，而不注意硏究工作，必致發生凌亂現象，並將影響生產。據渠就任兩週來視察結果，深知硏究工作，雖嫌太迂，然亦未可厚非。若干立委詢問農部機構蕪雜，事權不一，中央地方權限劃分，亦多不合理處，盼能改善。</p>
<h3>立委職代名額交兩委會研討</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立委職業代表名額增加問題，廿九午後於立院例會提出複議，以程序上尙有値得研討之處，決議先交憲法法規委會及法制委會硏討。該案廿九日於會中提出後，首由憲法法規委會委長劉克儁報吿審查經過，略謂：立委選罷法前經本院通過，並經國府公布後，國府以立委職代名額有增加必要，當將該案交付本院複議，憲法法規委會廿七開會討論。會中意見大致可歸納為下列數類：（一）根據立委選罷法第四條規定，立委總額達七百餘人，為數已極衆多，不應再為增加；（二）原條規定職代五六人，係比照區域代表十分之一之比數決定者，現區域代表名額旣增至六百七十名，職代各額可比例增至六十七人；（三）遵照國府命令，將職代名額增至百一十人，（四）按照立委總額六百七十餘人百分之十五之比數，將職代名額增加至一〇二名，（五）視全國職業團體會員名額多寡而定職代名額；（六）暫時不作決定，送交大會商討。最後決定，採取第六種方法。憲法法規委會對該事不作任何決議，僅將該案送大會裁奪。劉氏報吿畢，劉不同委員首起發言，對增加職代名額事，表示不能同意，並舉出五點理由，說明即使增加亦僅能由五十六人增至六十七人。呂復委員指出複議與修改不同之點。據稱，法律於完成立法程序而未公布前，內容有需要改正之處，再交立法機關討論者，謂之「複議」，若法律已完成立法　續並經公布施行，因有再加修正必要，而交由立法機關討論者，則稱之為「修改」，二者性質完全不同，現立委選罷法早經立院完成立法程序，並由國府於本年三月卅一日明令公布，國府近又就立委職代名額交立院「複議」程序上有所不合；抑有進者，即使不作複議，而令立院對該法予以修改，於法亦有不合。根據　國慣例，本屆所通過之法律，不能於同一屆中再為修改，何况立委選罷法自公布以來，尙未發現有何疵點，有需要立院加以修正之處。呂氏結論謂，法律非同兒戲，立法有其尊嚴，職代名額斷不能再為增加。孫九錄等亦各發言，表示名額不能再增。最後決議，該案在程序上旣有問題，立院對立委職代名額事不作任何決議，先將該案交憲法法規委會及法制委會會同研討，再向大會報吿。</p>
<h3>蘇浙湘粵等省立委選區劃定</h3>
<p>又廿九日會中對蘇浙等省立委區域劃分問題，亦已有所決定，蘇省金塘劃入第一區，高淳劃入第二區，浙省仙居移第三區，文成加入第三區，寗海移第二區，分水·桐廬·建德·淳安移第四區。此外，湘·粤劃區問題，亦已解決。至僑民代表問題，僑委會有意　十九名增至廿五名，西藏代表名額問題趙委員珮建議，自十名增至十二名，劉委員家駒主張自十名增至廿名，會中並未加以討諭亦未作任何決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕參政員王曉籟，吳蘊初，江一平等，頃以立院定廿九日召集院會，決定職業團體立委名額，特於廿八日下午五時訪孫院長，希望立法院對此問題暫從緩議，俾得有充分時間考慮參政會之提案。王氏等旋分別向社會部谷部長正綱及組織部陳部長立夫，晨工部馬部長超俊，陳述希望，一致支持此項原則，勿遽作硬性決定。</p>
<p>〔又電〕江蘇省立法委員各額分配及選舉區劃分表，業經廿九日立院會議通過，茲誌如次，總計六十三縣市，應產生立委名額女性三，男性卅五。</p>

<p>第六區，淮陰，淮安，漣水，灌雲，贛楡，東海，沭陽，連雲市四名，選舉事務所設「淮陰」</p>
<p>第七區，徐州市，銅山，碭山豐縣，蕭縣，邳縣，睢寗，泗陽，宿遷，沛縣五名，選舉事務所設徐州市。</p>
<h3>聽取處理學潮經過　立院今聞臨時會　張羣朱家驊等出席報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕立法院三十日晨九時將開臨時會議，總取張羣·朱家驊·張厲生·董顯光等報吿處理學潮，封閉三報館經過及今後應付學生運動辦法。此一決議係立法院廿九日午後例會時，呂復·傅統先等委員提出兩項臨時動議而決定者。呂復所提動議，建議請張院長蒞院答覆有關學潮，治安及封閉三報館事之詢問。傅氏臨時動議，擬請朱部長來院說明處理學潮經過以及今後應付學生運動辦法，以資立法院同人對學潮問題有所建議。若干委員認為上述問題不特與敎育有關，且關係內政及新聞，盼張部長，董局長亦能來院，普決定請張·朱·張·董同來答覆，惟待至下次開會期間尙有半月，間時過久，最好能於六月二日前開會，最後決議臨時會議定三十日晨舉行。</p>

<h3>中大行政會發表勸告同學復課書　北平學生成立復課委會</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕中央大學行政會議，今通過勸吿同學復課書，略謂：中大學生運動曾經有過光榮的表現，去年「一二五」「二二二」兩次運動，以目標公正，遠大，組織嚴密合理，行動恪守紀律，故犧牲甚少的時間，獲得盛大的效果，深得各方的同情與讚許。此次罷課已逾半月，佔本學期授課時間五分之一，使學校陷於停頓混亂之中。學校的建設，與同學的學業，損失甚大。須知要「搶救敎育」必先搶救學校，要搶救學校，必先愛護學校，重視學業。同學在抗戰及復員時期，學業上所受損失已極重大，急謀補救尙感不及，安能長此犧牲。爭取和平本為全國人民一致的要求，欲求其必能成功，須以超然的立塲，提出公正合理，而為各方可能接受的意見與方案。若須有所表示，可在任何時間合理提出，何必早早預定六月二日示威遊行，適與延安方面去年規定反內戰運動的紀念日相同，很易使社會人士懷疑此運動與黨爭的聯緊。須知學校是聖潔的，絕不能使其成為黨爭的塲所，且後罷課的北大·淸華等校，均已復課，最近參政會對同學向政府所提意見，已有答復，務希望同學本愛護學校愛護學業的熱忱，即日復課為要。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿九日電〕平各大學反對罷課學生，頃成立「各大學學生復課委員會」，並發表宣言，揭穿犧牲靑年學業陰謀家的面具謂：「我們絕不反對這次所發動的要求增加公費，增加副食費，提高敎授待遇的學生運，不過我們痛心我們的運動在中途變了質，四億三千六百五十萬元的金錢魔力下變了質。我們純潔的靑年變成別人政治鬥爭利用的工具」，並指出這次學潮經費支出的浩大，足以抵償平市各大學一個月公費而有餘，此外，平各大中學愛護學業同學，亦同時發表聯合宣言，提出三項呼籲：（一）反對各黨派以靑年學生作政爭的工具，（二）我們需要安靜求學反對罷課，（三）一切搗亂份子，從學生羣中滾出去！</p>

<p>英國工黨大會於廿六日在馬蓋特開幕後，連日以來，討論英國當前的內政外交方針；反對派在會外的叫器，以及在會議席上的爭辯，頗有使英國政治引起軒然大波的可能。惟英國人民是一個剛毅沈着的民族，理智重於情感，雖在情緒緊長的關頭，却乃能保持冷靜，立塲縱有差別，而他們的體念時艱，顧全國家大局，彼此仍完全相同。所以這次工黨大會的空氣，雖然非常緊張，反對派的聲勢雖也相當浩大，但始終並未引起英國政治的風浪，這固不能不說是英國工黨政府執政兩年的成功使然，而他們民族的民主風度確也値得欽羨。在戰後舉世擾攘不安的今日，英國工黨執政兩年，有此成就，實在値得世人重視的。工黨的艱苦奮鬥，終於克服了經濟的困難，尤其値得我們中國政府與人民的一致注意。『他山之石，可以攻錯』，中國國民黨的當局更加應該虛心學習的！</p>
<p>第二次世界大戰的砲火，好比是大英帝國日益沒落的象微，多數人都替它憂慮。在大戰期間，英國人自己也在担憂，不論戰爭的結局如何。戰後英國在國際上的地位。終將要一落千丈。及至大戰結束之後，英國一則因印度和各自治領的相繼求去，再則因國內物資的匱乏，使自己的生存也不得不依靠別國的協助與接濟，英國前途的悲慘，使戰後英國第一次普選的結果，對於這次大戰獲得勝利有赫赫之功的保守黨，竟遭到空前的慘敗，而由工黨領袖艾德禮取邱吉爾的地位而代之。一九四五年八月廿八日，艾德禮首相第一天到唐寗街十號去辦公時的心情，誰都知道是一則以喜，從此工黨領袖可以充分發揮其政治智慧了，一則以懼，展望英國的前途荊棘叢生，如何安然渡過横在面前的這許多難關，都是嚴重的問題。所以工黨從執政到現在，將近整整的兩年，沒有一天不在風雨飄搖之中，也沒有一天不戰戰兢兢的在苦幹。以國際局勢而論，締造世界和平，不是一件輕而易舉的事業，甚至其締造和平之非易，超過盟國在戰時獲得勝利的艱難：而戰後因爲美蘇兩國尙未能融洽無間，幾乎不能兩立的兩種勢力，使英國介乎其間，英國當然非常感到不安。英國雖以和平第一爲其外交政策的基調，但是處在美蘇對立的夾縫中，何去何從，外交當局實有不易解決的苦悶。至以國內情形而論，其嚴重性並不亞於戰時，人民日常生活所需的物資，無一不有匱乏之虞，衣食所需，至今還保持着戰時的配給制度。工黨政府爲了應付國內房荒，媒荒，糧荒，常常感到走頭無路。他們有時雖也不免手忙足亂，但經過艱苦奮鬥之後，終於先後安然渡過了難關。我們回憶兩年來英國的內政外交，對於英國工黨政府的苦幹精神，不能不表示萬分的欽佩。</p>
<p>但是由另一個角度去觀察，英國工黨內閣所實施的內政外交政策，並不是完全沒有可以批評的地方。以外交政策而論，工黨政府爲應付印度，巴勒斯坦，曁埃及所採取的辦注，幾無一不爲保守黨所反對，故在下議院中，常常遭到反對派領袖邱吉爾艾登等的非議，但是貝文外相在歷次國際會議中所採取的立塲，常常與美國不謀而合，無形中造成了英美聯合對付蘇聯的形勢，因此又常常遭到工黨中所謂『叛黨議員』的叫囂，指斥工黨的外交政策和保守黨的外交政策並沒有不同的地方。因而在下議院中，工黨政府也時常遭受到叛黨領袖齊里亞古斯與克洛斯曼的冷嘲熱諷。他們右工黨大會開幕的前夕，並曾在各處散發小册子『保持左翼』，要求工黨採取親蘇疏美的外交政策；工黨方面也散發了一種小册子叫做『攤牌』，其意在責蘇聯不能　誠合作，用以答覆『叛黨份子』的質問。關於這個外交政策問題，在工黨大會中還要　出來討論，屆時一塲熱烈的辯論，殆恐無注避免了。</p>
<p>其次，關於國內經濟，工黨政府在這兩年之中，一本其工黨旣定的政綱，不斷推行將全國企業收歸國營的辦法，已由將煤碳收歸國營而推行及運輸事業收歸國營。在工黨而言，這是工黨社會經濟政策的一種，唯有切實施行，以觀其成效；但在保守黨而論，則又視此爲反對工黨內閣的最好資料。所以邱吉爾也常常借題發揮，以工黨的國營政策來攻擊工黨。在另一方面，英國工黨政府格於國內的物質環境，雖欲盡其最大的努力，以改善人民的經濟生活；但是艾德禮首相終苦無法造成奇蹟，一舉而能使英國人民豐衣足食。惟其如此，英人的一衣一食，至今還保留着戰時的配給制度，遂使一般對工黨抱着奢望的人們，不能不表示失望；尤其是工黨內部的激烈份子，頗小以工黨政府的經濟政策爲然。一剖分的工黨黨員，爲了要使英國在經濟上能自力更生起見，已提出六項要求；（一）擬就統一管制勞工及限制次要工業雇用工人之計劃；（二）增撥美元，用以購買美國機器及設備；（二）增添混合生產委員會之委員人數；（四）實行生產津貼制度；（五）修改現行所得稅制；（六）禁止奢侈品進口。預料這個提議提出討論時，必然引起熱烈辯論。但是我們知道，英國在經濟上最重要的間題，一是提高生產量，二是增加出口貿易。惟在目前英國國內物資缺乏的情况之下，欲求生產的增加與出口貿易增加，的確是一件不容易的工作。『巧婦不能爲無米之炊』，此問題尙有待於工黨大會的從長討論。</p>
<p>要而言之，英國工黨政府執政兩年，雖不能謂已有赫赫的政績，但是在這種艱難的環境之中，能正視現實，脚踏實地，埋頭苦幹，不僅替英國斛決了不少的問題，而且到處都能化險爲夷，使英國渡過了許多重難關，究竟楚難能而可貴了。艾德禮首相對於英國復興的貢獻，是不容世人輕視的。英國工黨政府秉政兩年來的政績，足以證明溫和的經濟革命的成功，是最値得我國政府效注的。看看人家，想想自己，不禁感慨萬千！</p>

<h3>印度國大黨通知英政府　分治計劃決難接受　甘地責英蔑視印少數民族</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕印督蒙巴頓偕夫人於今晨七時十五分乘私人專機返新德里，此去携有經英閣批准之移轉印度政權方案。印督參謀長伊斯美，私人秘書華生等同機隨行。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕據此間印度國大黨方面人士談稱：國大黨業已通知英政府，謂該黨無論在何種情形之下，均不能接受印度劃分為印度斯坦及巴基斯坦之計劃。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿八日電〕甘地今晚發表演說稱：英國必須先殺死我甘地，然後乃可劃分印度，英國倘有誠意，自須履行諾言，退出印度，印度在英國退出之後，不問能以和平方式或以內戰方式解決，均與英國無關。又英督謂凡遇舉行重要商討時，輙置基督敎徒及拜火敎徒等少數民族于不　，殊屬不當云。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿八日電〕印度各地仍盛傳印督於六月二日向印度領補提出政權移轉方案後，全境將發生大規模之流血暴動。甘地及錫克族領袖辛格均曾分別提及此事，甘地在祈禱會中，促請人民不必憂慮，不必恐懼，渠日『如回盟表示「不與我巴基斯坦，吾人即將用劍」，吾人當答以「吾人決不奧汝以巴基斯坦，汝儘可將我或國家切成碎片」諸君如有勇氣作此語，則上帝必能擊斷回敎徒之劍』。錫克族領袖辛格，在本哲布省首邑拉　爾致辭，表示六月二日以後本哲布可能發生動亂，但望印督宣布之計劃，能使該省之錫克族獲得公允待遇。本哲布省之回盟國大黨錫克族及其他派別之領袖，今日在拉霍爾召開圓吳會議，討論恢復該省秩序之問題，尼赫魯可望於明日抵拉霍爾。同時據總司令部宣布，印軍第四師即曾隨英第八軍轉戰北非及義大利之一師，已自印南部調至本哲布省以資戒備。英軍總司令歐欽萊克日內可自倫敦趕返印度坐鎭。</p>
<h3>英工黨年會投票表決　擁擠貝文外交　裁减軍額建議遭否決</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：英工黨年會對貝文外交政策，幾乎一致投信任票，在一千二百代表中，投票表示反對者不過數十人。事前貝文曾作九十分鐘之演說，指責國會中工黨左翼份子乘渠與美政府作重要商談之際，向其放射冷箭云。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫數廿九日廣播：在今日英國工黨年會中，反對英美「過份」親近及親蘇之工黨議員齊拉卡斯等，猛烈抨擊貝文之親美外交政策，並提出議案，加强英蘇友好關係，要求大會通過。當貝文步上講合時，大受歡迎，大部份談員對其外交政策，仍將予以支持。</p>
<p>〔聯合社瑪蓋特廿八日電〕工黨年會今日於初步辯論貝文外交政策時，左翼份子要求檢討軍事義務及軍隊分配與組織，俾大量减低政府對於一九四八年三月一日所立目標，此一綜合提案以二十三萬七千票對十萬另九千票彼否決。此外在應付全國經濟危機之經濟設計及電力生產提案方面，政府亦獲勝利，</p>
<h3>英財相主張　自力更生　勿再抑賴外債</h3>
<p>〔合衆社　蓋特廿八日電〕財相達爾頓今日在工黨大會發表演說稱，英國必不能再仰賴美國之借款，關於人力與外交政策問題所提出之反政府決議案，望大會能加以否決或撤消。目前美國借款即將動用吿罄，吾人決不能再依賴外債，須求自力更生。英國之將來全賴增進輸出貿易，然後始可平衡輸入貿易，不然，吾人則將减低進口貨物，此為英國當前所面臨之最重大試騐，國家前途之成敗實繫於此。</p>
<h3>工黨內部裂痕日深　執委會間接予以承認</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社嗎蓋特廿八日電〕關於工黨秘書處數日前向大會所散發之「抬面上之紙牌」一書，工黨執委會頃向大會就該書發表聲明，所言殆已間接承認工黨內部之裂痕。略謂，該賽係工黨所刊行，但並非說明本黨政策之謂，惟為討論外交政策之「貢獻」而已。若千觀察家認為工黨執委今日發表與聲明，實已暴露其窘狀。今日工黨大會有二大重要事實，値得加以注意，即礦工與工程師協會所擁護之工黨黨員，有極多數要求（一）恢復「勢工指導」之制度，及（二）樹立一貫之工資政策。但大會徇反對派協會之要求，將上述二項要求均加以拒絕。</p>
<h3>蘇外次易人</h3>
<p>由鮑格莫洛夫繼任</p>
<p>〔法新聞社巴黎廿八日電〕此間本日接獲莫斯科傳來消息稱：蘇職當局已於本年一月廿四日公佈命令，任命駐法大使飽格莫洛夫為外交部次長，蘇聯當局又於三月十九日公布命令，將外交部次長德康諾索夫免職。上述二項命令，係在五月七日之蘇聯官報中發表，但蘇聯各報迄未加以評論。</p>
<h3>土耳其態度堅定決維護領土完整　國會批准延長土邊境緊急狀態</h3>
<p>〔路透社安加拉廿九日電〕土耳其總理貝克吿國會稱：某一外國藉口共同防務措施，已致牒土政府要求取得土國根據地，土耳其今已面臨幾等於領土的要求。土國雖在充滿危險的空氣中，仍當保持堅決態度。此等土地要求，似無放棄之意，因此土政府於綫密考慮之下乃決定在目前環境下不能實行軍隊之復員。吾人殊不能忽視我國家前途之重大負擔，土國今年成為中東東方及地中海東部之基石。土耳其今尙不知何時將遭逢內部勢力侵略的威脅，此雖僅為一種可能性，但亦不得謂其並不可能云。土總理旋乃要求國會批准延長土國歐洲部份及接近希保兩國區　內自一九四〇年以來所宣布之「緊急狀態」，國會當予批准延長。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕安加拉電台報吿稱：土總理貝克向一美國記者談稱，土耳其願輿蘇聯保持友誼，但決不接受「慕尼黑條件」下的友誼，所幸目前並無張伯倫或達拉第之徒秉政，張迫土耳其接受「慕尼黑型」之條件，以資綏靖蘇聯。土耳其頗願對蘇採取善鄰政策，為恢復兩國問之友誼起見，蘇聯務須放棄其侵犯土國領土完整之用意。土耳其決不願同意甚至討論土地之讓與或准許外國使用土國之根據地。</p>
<h3>四强將在倫敦開會討論　非洲義屬地問題　勢必牽涉各國重要利益</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕四强不久　在倫敦開會，討論義大利殖民地之未來，其主要之困難，乃爲對此等義屬非洲殖民地之任何一地建立託管，均將牽涉重要之戰略利益。其重要究至如何之程度，則須俟下列四問題解決以後始能度量：（一）埃及向安理會申訴以期使英軍退出蘇彝士運河區及蘇丹；（二）聯合國大會就巴勒斯坦問題之討論，最後當能決定英國是否將結束其委治，撤退註在聖地之軍隊；（三）一九二六年蒙德其公約之修正企圖，蘇聯之是否得在韃　尼爾海峽取得軍事茲地，須於修正海峽公約後始能決定；（四）義大利目前之內政危機，其結果可以決定諸強對於議大利要求託管其一部份殖民地事之能度。在前項問題獲得解決以前，英國猶不能擬具近東之最後防務計劃，此項計劃可能牽涉東菲基地之發展，以決定阿比西尼亞對伊里特利亞之要求。在巴勒斯坦及埃及問題獲得解決前，諸强實難以決定阿拉伯國代表北非阿刺伯居民所作之要求。在黑海海峽問題獲得解決以前，蘇聯猶不能快定是否可放棄其單獨託管里比亞之要求。蘇聯於一九四五年九月之倫敦外長會議中，即曾提出此項要求，而英國則以如由蘇聯單獨託管里比亞，將為對蘇彝士運河之最重威脅，故堅決予以反對。自社魯門主義宣佈以後，國際局勢益趨複雜，美國是否將因此反對蘇聯之單獨託管，尙難預測。以言共同託管制施行之初，恐亦有困難，觀乎朝鮮問題之拖延不決，即可明矣。</p>
<h3>美蘇委會談判　依然無成就</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：蘇聯及美國駐韓軍事代表希鐵柯夫及白朗今日恢復有關韓國政體問題之談判，結果未經宣佈，雙方定星期六發表公報。</p>
<p>又訊：今日之談判，未獲任何成就。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿九日電〕美蘇混合委員會美首席代表白朗將軍廿九日晨要求蘇首席代表希鐵柯夫將軍立即重開委員會，討論選擇朝鮮各政黨代表及個人代表，以邀請其參加會議，備諸詢之用。被指定商對選擇朝鮮各政黨代表及個人代表之小組委員會，未能獲致協議。美方代表已於廿九日晚向白朗報吿此項僵局。</p>
<h3>英美佔領區當局宣布　德境設經濟委會　並邀請蘇法參加經濟合併計劃</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：德境英軍事副長官勞勃遜及美軍總司令克萊來今日聯名宣佈成立「全德經濟委員會」，從事計劃兩佔領區之建設，此一委員會成立後，德人本身已獲得戰事結束以來最大之經濟權力。但在本日公報中，英美雙　鄭重聲明：該委員會在採取行動前，必須獲得英美兩方之同意。</p>
<p>〔聯合社柏林廿九日電〕德經濟委員會委員共五十四人，將由德國各邦議會選出。克萊與勞勃遜聯名通吿，再度邀請蘇法兩國參加美英兩區已從一月一日起實行之經濟合併。</p>
<h3>馬歇爾力促參院批准發展聖勞倫斯河條約　目的在加强美加聯防</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕馬歇爾國務卿，前總統胡佛以及其他人等，曾向正在審查五億元國際發展案之參院外交委會提供意見。馬歇爾國務卿於述及美國與加拿大所訂以發展聖勞倫斯河之條約時，力促參院速即批准該約，良以該項發展計劃對於美加聯防北美大陸，具有不可限量之帮助。聖勞倫斯河計劃完成後，可使海洋巨艦在比較安全的內河中建造，對美國之工業心臟區開闢一新的重要交通綫，其水力發電量堪與坦尼西河流域及哥倫比亞柯洛拉杜河流域之發電量相等，此等發展均為發展原子能之先決條件。胡佛之言涉及世界糧食問題。渠云：若海運暢通，美國餘糧可以悉數運往國外救濟災民，目前每日至多僅能以糧食一百五十萬噸供給大西洋彼岸。</p>
<h3>西半球軍事合作　英甚表贊同</h3>
<p>〔中央社倫數廿八日合衆電〕政府高級人士今稱：英國對杜魯門西半球軍事合作之聲明，甚表贊同。關於杜氏向加拿大提出之建議，該官員稱：英國去歲於倫敦召開之自治領會議中，曾議決各自洽領應參與如杜氏所提出之此種區域性防務協定，加拿大之參與此穢防務協定，將可增強英美之軍事連繫，並可使美洲之軍隊與英國與西歐半球獲致調協。</p>
<h3>日三黨內閣漸趨具體　社會黨委曲求全　民主黨所提四條件已全部接受</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿九日電〕政局已步入三黨聯合組閣之階段，社會黨因痛感拉攏民主黨入閣之必要，故對於民主黨今後之交涉，極力求其妥協。將在聲明中表明社會黨與共產黨絕綠，關於閣僚之分配比率，擬為六，六，二。關於具體政策，盡量尊重民主黨之主張。如民主黨仍不入閣時，則擬成立與國協之兩黨內閣，此時閣僚不單限於黨內，將廣求各方面人材，以對抗在野保守黨之攻擊。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿九日電〕據消息靈通人士稱：廿九日舉行之民主黨幹部會議中，大勢所趨，已向三黨組閣之途前進。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿九日電〕片山首相廿九日正午於首相官邸，召見民主黨藘田及幣原，就組閣問題曾要求作最後之協力。對此，民主黨於午後特召開會議，決定接受社會黨之要求，但附有如下之條件：（一）絕對不能洩　閣議之秘密：（二）勿作惹起社會不安之言動；（三）絕對不採極右極左之行動；（四）若有違反以上諸條件者，各黨採取有責任之處置。以上四條件已由一松代表民主黨通知社會黨。社會黨接到民生黨提出之條件後，於下午五時召開中央執行委員會，決議完全接受該四項條件，並即派員前往自由黨，民主黨，國協黨，分別通知社，民兩黨協定之內容。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿九日電〕民主黨接獲社會黨承認該黨所提條件之通知後，於下午七時起召開幹部會議，討論今後對片山內閣應持之能度。黨內以蘆田，幣原，齋籐三人為中心，而形成左，右，中間三派意見之對立，結果未能獲得結論，最後決定留候三十日再討論，九時散會。</p>
<h3>傳蘆田均將被整肅</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿八日電〕據最可靠方面消息：民主黨總裁置田均將遭整黨，並聞整肅令將於當合內閣組成後發表。</p>
<h3>美國軍事代表團第二批顧問赴希</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿八日電〕美陸軍部宣佈：第二批軍官十四人，士兵二名，昨飛往雅典，調查依據對希土援助計劃之軍事援助事宜，第三批最近亦將前往。</p>
<p>〔合衆社安加拉廿八日電〕美土兩國軍事談判可於本月卅日結束，美方奧列佛將軍之代表團即將視察土境，包括若千軍事區域在內。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿八日電〕太平洋艦隊總司令鄧斐爾德上將預定即將訪問澳洲，與英國官方商談太平洋防票問題。海軍部宣稱，鄧氏此行係屬「社交」性質。其他官方人士則謂討論範圍或將包括馬納斯島與西南太平洋美國其他戰時基地之前途。馬島現有美軍駐守，關於繼續使用一節，澳洲已向美國提出問題。</p>
<h3>暹邏內閣總辭職</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷廿八日電〕暹下院經一週來之總辯論後，雖下院已通過信任投票，但政府今仍向攝政會提出總辭職。預料　食隆將奉召組織新閣。</p>

<h3>疏導學潮特種委會議决　慰問學生調查眞相　越軌被捕者擬當局從輕發落　均俟向大會報告後進行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會疏導學潮特種委員會，於昨日下午三時在該會舉行會議，商討疏導辦法，由王正廷任主席。在座十餘位參議員均紛紛發言，結果通過辦法四點，並定今日下午三時織續舉行會議，確定「吿學生書」等，俟向大會報吿後，即行辦理。</p>
<p>王正廷首稱：此次多數學生受少數不良份子之煽動，發生學潮，幸現已漸吿平息，希望學生能善意復課。渠並受靑年會總幹事陸幹臣之囑托，代爲呼籲，近有若干學生被捕，希望政府當局能將大事化小事，小事化無事。陶百川表示目前務使被打學生受到安慰與保障，然後再加以疏導，否則若繼續採用强硬方式，事態蔣更惡化。希望政府當局切忌刺激，即對已被捕學生亦宜减少刺激。葉風虎主張，自根本着手，應設法使純潔善良學生之主張，得到歸宿，導其走向應走之方向，則以後學潮亦可免發生。渠建議參議員以私人資格，尙有關學校調査眞相。王維駰提出治標方法，如組織訪問團，分別至各校調査。治本方法，如由各校產生合法之學生自治會代表，由本會與各該代表直接商討等。龐京周謂，組織訪問團，時間上似太侷促，可否採用緊急方法，邀各校首長與本會作一次座談。在竹一稱，各校發生情事內容因素各各不同，故應針對個別之問題以求解決，政府當局應减少刺激，報章刋動消息亦不宜過於激動。渠提議在今日開始，分別與各校校長交換意見。趙仰雄表示：（一）被捕學生中有主張罷踝者，亦有主張復課者，參議會是否主張釋放，應表示公正態度。（二）受傷學生是否要慰問？（三）若干學校校長及其他負責人均要辭職，是否應予挽留？（四）對學生家長是否應商請勸導及約束子弟？趙君豪建議由本會推派代表慰問受傷學生。黄式金希望當局要懂得靑年心理，切不可火上加油逮捕學生。同意燕大敎授意見，由學生敬崇之敎員開導。</p>

<h3>華鋁廠抗不復業　社局將建議由政府接管</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕瑞士總領事爲瑞商華鋁鋼精廠停業糾紛事，昨日往訪社會局長吳開先。吳局長表示，該廠貿然停業，殊爲不當。廠方所提解僱一二肇事工人，社會局固可同意，但繼之又欲無故解僱一百餘名，殊屬無理。社會局兩次飭令復業，未曾遵命。廠方如有不服，儘可申請市政府仲裁，長此關廠不顧工人，則屬違法。工人若無故罷工，按規定固可不給工資，今廠方無故突然停業，工人工資將請照發。</p>
<p>吳局長嗣對記者談稱：勞資雙方，無論何方如若對調解不服，可聲請仲裁。如旣不履行調解筆錄，逾期又不聲請仲裁，則一方可向法院控吿。社會局對此種達背法令之勞方或資方，亦必予以適當處置。吳局長表示，設若予以解散等處分，徒然引起工人失業恐慌，故渠將建議中央，遇有此種情事時，可仿照美國之辦法，由政府予以接管。</p>

<p>記者於昨午走訪公用局長趙曾珏，叩詢對於解決本市公用事業虧損問題將携帶何種方案晋京。據趙局長表示：自生活指數解凍後，公用事業機關之虧損勢必逐月增加，而中央將不勝其負担，若目前勉爲其難，增加貼補金額，則將來必有無法担負之一天，若待公用事業價格不得不予調整時，上漲之倍數必甚可觀其影響於市民亦鉅，故吳市長及趙局長均認爲本市之公用事業，與目前之物價相絞，確有調整之必要。據趙局長表示：今後公用事業或將准其自動調整價格，惟須根據三項因素，即燃料（煤及汽油），生活指數，及外匯。各公用事業機關於調整價格時，必須根據成本之最低額，呈文公用局，轉請市府核准。又據記者自有關方面探悉，本市各公用事業機關目前呈請市府調整價格之倍數雖不一致，唯平均數則至少在四五倍左右。</p>

<p>在厦戰情</p>
<p>至此次在厦之戰，以第二戰菲僑最稱緊張，上半時爲六比四，第三節各十四，最後一節，華聯始以廿八對十九奏凱，殊屬幸運，菲僑有蔡文章莊玉靈及全菲第一前鋒李世僑等，實力非常雄厚，乃竟受挫，要亦球運耳。在厦承市政府，國民體育會，白馬體育會盛宴招待，廿八日並冒雨游覽名勝及鼓浪嶼，招待股勤，殊屬可感，本人乃於廿八晚在莊友仁寓中，宴請該市機關首長及體壇先進，藉以答謝，至球負方面表演，以吳成章及李震中最佳，市長亦備加讚許，陳學崇亦負傷出傷二次云。</p>

<p>開賽之後，上行王隊長萬春一氣呵成，九對〇佔絕對優勢，旋以周福寬因脚傷離塲，稍見鬆懈，但仍爲上行操縱局勢，上半時十八對五，上行勝。下半時頻頻調生力軍上塲，稍見平衡，而上行之凌克誠則一人天下央行無法阻止其活躍故上行終以三〇　　四，大敗央行。</p>

<h3>收購春蘭廠商貸款　已撥一千二百餘億　與農行簽訂合約者共達六十九家</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國農民銀行息：核定收繭廠商向該行簽訂收商貸款合約者，迄目前爲止，憶達六十九家，收購担數總額達五四五七二担，按每担鮮　貸額三百五十萬元計，再加中蠶公司代收各廠溢贛絲豐遜備款項一百五十億元，折合貸款總額達二〇六〇億元。　廠商方面與中晨行簽訂合約者，前後共達七批。其歷次詳數，有如下列：</p>
<p>（批次）（廠商家數）（收購　額）</p>
<p>第一批　二九　三六七六一担</p>
<p>第二批　二八　一〇七六〇担</p>
<p>第三批　三　一三四四担</p>
<p>第四批　二　一八七八担</p>
<p>第五批　三　一五三六担</p>
<p>第六批　三　一四二七担</p>
<p>第七批　一　八六六担</p>
<p>合计　六九　五四五七二担</p>
<p>又迄目前為止，江浙兩省簽訂合約之廠商，業已備具一應手續，取到貸款者，共達五十四單位。實際貸出之款額，共達一二一三億元。據悉：有若干廠商所以尙未前往領取貸款者，蓋尙待籌措貸款額中之一成墊款，故不無稽延。</p>
<p>至各廠商在江浙各地收繭超過核定之額度時，其溢額由中蠶公司代為收購。收購資金，在二千億元貸額中另撥一百五十億元供用。又中蠶公司在安徽區收繭資金廿億元，現已感不敷，亦在該項另撥之一百五十億元資金中，撥出五億元供用云。</p>
<h3>各地收繭均用現鈔</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕中央銀行副總裁劉攻芸，昨日接見記者，答覆記者所提問題多則，茲摘誌大要如次：（一）平行綫本票，本行並未發行，即在江浙各地收繭，亦全部以現鈔使用。（二）目前茶貸施策，政府對去年度之存茶，以收購方式推動外銷。對本年度之新茶，則採貸款方式，以協助茶葉之產銷。至貸款辦法，現正呈政院核示中，不久即可有具體規定。（三）政府扶助大宗出口物資，主要原則，在扶助出口物資之產銷。蓋近來國內外市價未能協調，商人出口，將遭虧蝕，乃羣請政府收購外銷，以資補救。政府收購後，其盈虧槪歸國庫負擔。惟該項收購絕無統制性。商人如能自運，則仍聽便</p>
<h3>民食調配委員會　下週內可成立　米市行堅後疲粳秈續降</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市民食調配委員會下週內可正式成立。兼主任委員社會局長吳開先昨稱：該會組織草案擬就後，本定送三十日之市政會議討論，現因市政會議暫時停開，故呈奉吳市長審核，待吳市長批准即先行成立，再提市數會議商討。委員會成立後，社會倚原有之糧食科並不撤銷，學校工廠配米事宜，則移交調配會辦理。貧民靦米事，本月內已不及實行，社會局定六月二日邀各區區長及區民代表，開會商討。並已分函詢各區，對該項貧民配米事宜是否有能力辦理，以決定究由市府負責或自治機構主持。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨先堅後疲，開盤後各帮略有去化，情形較好。其後因粳米到貨稍稀，問津有人，且晨問天氣陰霾有雨意，人心趨堅，粳市遂回起數千元。秈米則因持貨者吐出不少，店胃有限，故市呈平定，仍維原價。至收盤前，因銀根關係，收購無力，粳秈米卒見回降，南北市同趨下游。昨市塲登記到貨共四千七百六十八石四斗，白粳高貨做價四十一萬元，薄稻四十萬元至四十萬五千元。</p>
<p>米麥食油充份供應</p>
<p>吳市長日前奉召晋京，已於廿八日返滬。據悉：此次除報吿滬市學潮經過外，對物價問題亦有重要命令撓返，今後對食米，（一）決暢通產區至滬交通，（二）配售米自下月起，由每月十八萬石增至卅萬石。食油，（一）本市繼續向東北區採購大豆，以應廠需。（二）商請其他機構，收購大豆等雜糧時，應依市塲合理價格，以免刺激產區價格上揚。麫粉，因產區麥季缺雨，今年收成恐不能達理想，本市對今後麫粉之原料來源，已考慮補救辦法。</p>
<p>麫粉昨乍升乍降，動搖不定，配粉又將實行，消化轉淡，回跌三五千元。麩皮交易冷淡，形勢平正。豆餅先漲後平，軋升二三千元。黃豆轉成定局。</p>
<p>油市靑島來貨踵接，逐步下游。生油豆油淸油菜油均見　挫萬元，蔴油平疲，菉豆節節下降，再低在二三千元，芝蔴去化動而不旺，高定次疲。生仁跌定，紅糧成交不多，暫少榮辱。苞米消化亦淡，無甚軒輊，赤豆挺立。</p>
<p>審查配米規定標準</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會敎育兩局，日來審查工廠學校之配米工作，異常緊張。公私立學校部份已有二百餘所核定，並已絡續發出繳款通知。工廠部份，則因其中不符辦法者頗多，為求迅速起見，嗣後以執有經濟部所頒之工字工廠登記證，及社會局所掣給管工字之工業登記聲請書臨時收據為限。其餘執有設字新字之公司執照，及商字商業登記證，曁管商字之商業登記聲請書臨時牧據者，一律不予審核，並即批復不准配售。</p>
<p>又本市若千工會，近有通知廠方不准將未入工會之工人列入配米情事，並向社會局請示。社會局昨已釋示：（一）申請配米應以工廠為單位，凡應用之職工童工均可列入證米，並無未入工會之工人不得享受配米權利之親定。（二）凡工廠職工必須持有國民身份證，如尙在請領中者，應俟領到後，開列號碼單於第一次領米時呈騐，如萬一不及在第一次領米時將上項身份證領到，得通融辦理。所有核定配米一律照發，但第二次申請時，則非有身份證不可。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕華綸洋行代理之建新輸，由曼谷運來食米四萬一千二百二十包，前日抵滬，即正起卸中。該項暹米係中信局採購，至建新輪則係益祥船行新由美國　進，兼這至暹羅運米，故該輪尚為首次到滬。</p>
<h3>統債稍見盤升</h3>
<p>公債昨以五〇三室力購二百餘萬，以致人心忽起新的幻想，市况蠢動。統丙晨開一三八〇〇元，低價一三七〇〇元，而後盤升至一四七〇〇元結束。收後喊高至一五三〇〇元左右，結果較前收計甲乙升七百元，丙漲一千元，丁升八百元，統戊微升四百元，成交約六百餘萬。</p>
<h3>外股散買活動</h3>
<p>外股昨平穩而盤，證券帮仍進怡紗，會德豐有銀行帮供售，散買頗為活動。怡紗晨開六八〇〇〇元，自六九五〇〇元盤低至六七〇〇〇元左右，結果較前收計業廣　業升半成，英聯尙平，餘股均吿微漲。</p>
<h3>食糖人心轉佳</h3>
<p>昨糖市以台公司配量减半，而花色又僅兩種，在需要方面，不象有缺乏之感，故人心轉佳，復趨上　。公會　　，秘魯砂升至四十四萬餘元，漲二萬餘元。三半重白四十四萬五千元，　四十五萬元，升二萬元。二〇中砂白三十九萬八千，升二萬餘元。二四組白四十九萬元至四十九萬五千元，升二萬五千元。台赤初為三十四萬元，後爲三十五萬元。汕提靑開二十九萬元，升七千元。黃崗靑貨較次，二十六萬五子元。汕頭赤高貨三十一萬元，成交百數十包。與化白升二萬許，開四十一二萬元至四十一萬五千元。輿赤三十一萬元升萬元，計五百餘簍。刁青初開二十五萬五千元，後開二十六萬二三千元，升萬餘元，成交一二百包。</p>
<h3>香烟賣多價挫</h3>
<p>昨日香烟市氣渡憊無神，乃因月底將　，同業有軋頭寸關係，塲中拋賣不寂，一般囤戶鋻於電訊日近，供售亦多。再加外　團行亦來吐出，塲上形成供過於求，行情遂頻吿下游。</p>
<p>大英牌烟初由六百六十七萬元，步小至五十八萬許徘徊，午後有零星添　，稍見回上，最後為六百七十三萬元，比上日軋升九萬元。老刀烟為五百八十五萬元，亦好五萬元。廿支大英烟拋貨尤多，儥由二萬二千元小至七千五百元，最後回至二萬八千二百元，每條軋降六百元。其餘華商烟及美貨條烟，亦以羣汛期近，進戶不前，致價跌過於漲。</p>
<h3>外埠實銷戶有吸　人造絲喊價堅俏　廠絲奇貨可居又見狂漲</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲因外埠實銷戶稍有吸胃，上午開盤即見漲風，一二〇號高山有光，先喊一千八百十萬元即有成交，後又直綫上升，最大喊過九百萬元，因買戶存觀望而低回，以八百六十萬元收盤。下午無甚交易，最後喊價為八百七十萬元，比上日大一百二十萬元。新天橋及東洋牌子，喊八百八十萬元，七五號半光喊價亦跟上一百萬元之譜。</p>
<p>昨市廠絲又呈狂漲，因傳浙鄕改良種鮮繭收價已提高至一百四十萬元，計算每担成本，需二千五百萬元，且市上存貨極少，一般執貨者，咸視為奇貨可居，一致扳俏。上午B字等級，討價竟喊二千五百萬元，還價四百萬元未成交。D字等級討價二千四百萬元，正式成交價為二千三百萬元。下午還價四百萬元，尙不肯脫手。其餘各級喊價，俱較上日漲起二百萬元之左，市况極形混亂，交易甚為寥落。干經五担頭有檢騐單，價討一千八百萬元，另担喊一千六百萬元左右，零過皆無正式交易。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨隨原料而上進，美亞被面現貨廠方開價九百萬元，塲內　子貨喊價八百八十萬元，大誠格子璧縐先做三萬一千二百元，中途一千五百元有成交，最後喊一千六七百元。下午因絲價高昂，人心更堅，喊三萬二千元賣出。華錦縐一萬四千元正式成交，盛貨價昨亦提高一二萬元不等。羅紡杭市報漲，羅經價一萬一千元，紡價一萬一千六百元，故申市昨亦大起五百元。</p>
<h3>市上傳說紛紜華股趨勢疲軟</h3>
<p>華股昨掉期套利雖賤，但以各種不利於遞交之消息，依然紛至沓來，堅穩之勢，終難支持到底。國際傳說及治安謠言又起，臨收復顯形不穩。</p>
<p>晨開見昂，一四二號九七號一一七號六八號七六號六五號二一五號六一號俱進，一三四號九九號進現永紗，遞永紗乃自七二五〇元開後，升高至七四〇〇元。八九號一二二號力售而稍回。中紡獨吿漲停。此時以掉期貼價小，頗為穩健。迨十時十分後，七一號一七九號一二號一一二號一七一號，永紗賣到七二五〇元，一二二號一二五號九四號九九號一〇六號尙進至七四〇〇元，二二六號一七一號一九三號一九九號一五五號一五四號一六〇號二三二號來售，傳說不利於遞交者甚多，遂起跌風。</p>
<p>二三一號二三五號八四號再賣到七〇五〇元左右，二二四號一二九號七七號一八六號一二號臨收斬售，　永紗乃迫迫低至六九二〇元。一四二號一五七號稍進，收市在六九五〇元左右掙扎，收後平和，結果較前收計新光新華永公平平，永紗信和華　景福微降，中法勤興各跌半成光景。雜股中紡漲停後有回，軋升一成有零。內衣跌一成弱，國貨小半成，火柴商務平平，榮豐統益麗安水泥微升，餘均稍降。遞交各股計新光獨漲半成，永紗升半成弱，信和勤興微升，永公景福則略跌，塲外各老股升降咸微。</p>

<h3>國行派員赴港　商討防止走私　進出口及匯走私數目龐大</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府近因督港走私問題，日趨嚴章，爲商討如何防止或減少走私之嚴重性起見。特由中央銀行派業務局副局長邵曾華，英　顯問羅傑士，及輸出推廣委會派執委沈熙　，聯袂去港，與該地主管當局，共同治商妥善方策。邵氏等一行，業於昨日飛港。預計將在港穗兩地勾留一　至旬日返滬。</p>
<p>據關係方面指出：香港走私之嚴重性有三：（一）出口走私；例如大量桐油，利用港地黑市外匯，走私出口，仍有厚利。（二）進口走私：國內不能核許進口之輸入品，常假道港地為集散轉運之點。（三）僑匯走私：因官價外匯與黑市外匯相差幅度過鉅，僑匯多遁跡香港。以上三項走私之金額，雖無確切估計，惟為數必極龐大。渠稱：港地經濟，與中國　地經濟息息相關，當不能坐視走私之惡化而不顧。故亟盼此次能獲得圓滿之解決辦法云。</p>

<h3>再論葡萄糖酸鈣</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>拙作「葡萄糖酸銬」一文，原　拋磚引玉，自本刋第十期發表後，竟能引起先進賢達，權威學者的注意，至爲榮幸，十三期蒙吳果誠先生用實騐來闡明眞理，無任銘感，十五期又承醫界先進汪企張氏的賜敎，尤爲感激！</p>
<p>鈣素缺乏，必易成結核症，結核病灶因大量消耗鈣索，所以結核病一定缺乏鈣素，互爲因果，這是結核病人，需要補充大量鈣素的主因，即使將來結核病的特效業發明後也許鈣素仍舊有需要相當補充的必要，不過不是需要長期注射吧了，病灶一痊，鈣素再能補充，正如任何大病後，能注射相當鈣素，能使病體早日康復，任何大病後，肺臟必弱，注射鈣素後，不但能强肺，且能健全肌肉神經，所以鈣素也能療治衰弱病人，因此，佝僂及肺病人，孕婦等果然需要大量鈣素，一切虛弱的人，尤其是發育未痊的兒童，更需大量補充，汪氏同情宋國賓氏的主張「老人及梅毒等，不需多鈣」老人肺結核如在發動期內，自宜權衡緩急，先救其急，需要鈣素應即用之，在末有更進步的藥劑發見前，當然無暇考盧「誘發他症」一層，因急需鈣素的病人，雖係年邁，若不補充，本病有增無减奈何？在這種情勢下，「誘發他症」不過次要問題，何况事實上不一定能誘發他症，鈣素究不是劇藥，汪氏亦昭示我們「過量之鈣能自然從　中排出體外，」當然無蓄積之害，年老者不注鈣素，血管也要硬化，如不需鈣素，當然無注射之必要，至梅毒性咯血，未騐血的診斷，大都悮爲結核性，注射鈣素，自然有害無益，反致貽悮病機。</p>
<p>肺結核病人，應用鈣素，經口自然無多大效騐，汪氏以爲「一鈣素經消化器，能起複雜變化」似尙有商討餘地，在鈣素注劑未發明前，結核病也能治愈？如果經口不宜服鈣素，所謂要起「複雜變化」，則內服鈣劑根本要自然淘汰了？事實上內服鈣劑自有其相當效騐；否則，先進各國衛生專家，也不主張由飲食中勸人補充鈣素了，徵之文獻在中國古時也有用鈣劑內服來治愈病肺的例子，茲特以本草上「白芨」（含有鈣質）項中有一段照抄如下：</p>
<p>「台州　吏，憫一重囚，囚感之云：『吾七犯死罪，遭刑拷肺損傷，得一方用「白芨」末，日服其效如神，』後囚凌遲，剖開胸，見肺開　穴數十，皆「自芨」塡補，色猶不變也，」</p>
<p>這段文字想來不致胡說？可以實騐來證明，那麼足徵鈣素在胃腸中分解，變性或與靜脈內血液中分解變性，誠有不同，但有益結核症則一，不過經口效弱力緩而已，靜脈注射其實還不是理想，不久將來，或許有直接注射肺臟病灶的發明，那才是眞正的目標，臨床上用鈣素治療反膚結核，每奏神效，深信能直接注入肺臟病灶，其效一定可意料不到，不過肺臟直接注射，受勿起刺激，那當然還有問題。</p>
<p>病灶自然需要不溶解之鈣，汪氏認爲：「爲使鈣質便入血中，利於輸送，及避免血栓；」所以要「配以各種酸基，便成溶解性之鈣，」達到目的地—病　，「仍是不溶解性之鈣塊而已一但事實上恐不如此，因不配以各種酸基的鈣，照樣可在血中暢通無阻，從未發生血栓，正如編者先生所加在拙作後面的按語所云：「人身本體對於酸質，及鈣質之控制與調度，自有其『轉有』之功能」所以溶解性與不溶解性的鈣質，都是有利結核，正如：果糖與葡萄糖，及服食澱粉質，照樣都能成營養份，「葡萄糖酸鈣與維他命丙」配合應用雖屬合理，有但些特異體質同時用偶有反應，不論併用，或分用，如「鈣」注于靜脈內，「丙」注于肌肉內，同樣有反應，所以遇此特異病人，愚見亦不主張併用，宜隔日交互應用，也許宋國賓氏的不贊成併用，痛心疾首維他命丙，大概曾吃了特異病人的痛苦？</p>
<p>凡是結核病結核菌分泌毒素而起的發熱，沒有其他病源時一律可用鈣素退熱，一般還熱劑，都不是根本之圖，鈣素才是結核熱的眞正的退熱劑。</p>
<p>汪氏三十年的經騐，加以化學硏究，發現「無論何種鈣劑，注入體內，經各組織時，受幾何階段之酸化作用，乃放棄原有之酸　，而與炭酸化合，形成不溶解性炭酸鈣塊，眞理更進一步，大白于天下，足徵鈣棄注入身體，「惟恐其不酸化，不起化學作用」，松敬以探討學術的立塲，請敎宋氏以爲如何？</p>
<p>總之：芻見：對葡萄糖酸鈣與抗報血病酸混用的論列，原屬老生常談，卑之無甚高論，對宋氏檢討的懷疑，也是天下大多數醫師的常情。</p>
<h3>中學衛生敎材重編有感</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>—籲請注重學校衛生敎育—</p>
<p>最近敎育部召開中學課程會議，修訂中學課程標準，這一種揹施，是吻合時代背景，以配合建國歷程，而舉行的，現在衛生課程內容方面，枯燥乏味，將予澈底推翻，另訂新標準，實在値得寄與殷切期望。</p>
<p>大敎育家E.G.Bonser說：「我以爲生活，健康和敎育，三者目標爲一，就是生長，並使得經騐豐富」，本來生活就是敎育，敎人如何生活？敎人如何健康的生活？當然爲苜要，而世事也就再無健康生活的重要，因此，中學生理衛生課程的修正，實爲必要，同樣的加强中學生的衛生敎育，維護學生健康的生活，以增長敎育效能，更爲必要了？</p>
<p>目前，一般學生成績低劣，有人歸咎到學生學習精神不够，馬虎敷衍，取巧爲一般通病，並指責學生不尊師重道，站在敎育的立塲，我們認爲這種看法，不無是處，可惜只雲到病理，未追溯到病原，即究全忽視了學生的健康問題，老實說：今天的學生是負荷這重的變壓器，他們吸取的營養素所轉變的熱量，是小於他們每天消耗的動能，供給四小時所需的營養素，作八小時的工作，勢所不能，正如「吃進靑草，擠出牛奶」，原不能保持身體正常的發育，又不能抵償必需的消耗，如何能有高度的工作能力，正如「要想馬兒好，又要馬兒不吃草」，一樣不可能的事實，呌一個東併西凑的爛機器，有好的工作效能，這是幻想，忽視了畢生的健康，呌學生有學的成續表現，也是不可能的。</p>
<p>今天許多人認爲學校爲傳授智識的塲所，無形把敎育當作商品，更有形無形的幹交易的苟當，除開販售智識外，什麽也不顧及，這是犯了不可原宥的錯誤，若認爲敎育破產與學生健康毫無關係，自然更不能領悟到衛生敎育與敎育的成敗是有關係的，忽視了學校衛生敎育，至少是今日敎育失敗的主要因素之一，因敎育即生活，即是利用生活經騐之總和去適應生活，而生活的主要要素，爲衣，食，住，行，然此四者皆透過健康，始克充實，因健康包括生命的全部，使個人宜於生活，又宜於服務，所以說：健康是功用，是生活的結果，而其本身並不是目的，故哥倫比亞大學J.F.Williams　說：Healthmay　be　defined　as　qualityof　life　that　renders　the　individual　fit　to　tive　most　to　serve　best，」因此今日的學校中必須實施衛生敎育，而學校衛生敎育的目的，應維護並增進敎育比與設敎育者的健康，此不僅是治療或檢査疾病，而此如何積極促進身心的健康，但有學校行政人員所謂的「衛生敎育」往往指學校以內的醫療事業，此皆對於衛生敎育之眞義，未能分解明晣，學校衛生與學校衛生敎育，亦往往混爲一事，甚至以衛生敎育包含學校中的一切衛生事業，並有將衛生敎育與體育認爲一事，即狹養衛生敎育的含義如何？亦各人意見分歧，有謂衛生敎育僅包含學校衛生課程，此均未了解衛生敎育的眞義。</p>
<p>學校衛生敎育是一種有組織的活動與設施，其目的在養成對於人類身心性情各方面健康狀况的習慣態度及智識，所以學校衛生敎育的活動與設施必須連續不斷，分級進行，且隨科學日新月異而共同進步，它的目的，不僅注意生理健康，且要顧及精神及性情的健康，不僅是智識的灌輸，尤宜注意態度及習慣兩方面的養成，近代衛生敎育家認爲衛生敎育應當以行爲爲主要目標，知職次之，我們固希望各個人能維持其健康行爲，並能解決健康上的問題，尤須時授以各種衛生智織，並養成重要的習慣，行爲和態度。</p>
<p>自一八三三年法國政府通過學校當局對於學校健康責任之規定起，至一九二四年美國三十五省對於學校醫藥之設備及健康的訓練，訂有相當的法律爲止，世界各國推行學校衛生敎育甚力，尤以美國積極推廣學校衛生敎育，並視作負敎育責任者，應盡的職責，中國方面，學校衛生以北平爲最早，由第一衛生事務所與協合醫學院合辦學校衛生事業，後來廣州，上海，南京各大埠均先後辦理學校衛生，民十八年國府頒布學校衛生實施方案，衛生部與敎育部組織學校衛生委員會，各省相繼成立衛生敎育處，縣民衆敎育指導員等，尤以江蘇成績最著，抗戰以後，中央衛生實騐院在沙坪壩舉辦學校衛生敎育事宜，惜均多偏重學校衛生，而非完整的學校衛生敎育，前年八月中央設計局，敎育部與衛生署曾聯合召請衛生敎育專家，擬訂全國學校衛生敎靑推行方案，同年九月敎育聯合年會，亦通過實施衛生敎育的五年計畫，並交付敎育部實施，時至今日，方案仍爲方案，計畫仍歸計畫，分毫未見諸事實，我門不無遺憾！</p>
<p>中學課程會議，決定整編衛生敎材，這當然是敎育行政與政策上的一大改革，敎人如何健康的生活？當然爲今後敎育的主官，因此，應該注意那些能够助長心理效能的習慣，與生理健康的行爲，而對身心健康，更注意實際的探討，習慣與健康行爲在目前中國的中學裏，也是十分重要的，我們要使他們根據着衛生原則和個人能力，建立合理的健康行爲。</p>
<p>現在學校敎育正在整頓刷新中，將來定有輝煌的後果，但我們仍過敏地說一句：「不要　　已學生時代的敎育模型，鑄成今日的敎育」，時代是進化的，願敎育界有一大覺悟，今後「敎育的第一任務，在使學生獲得健康」，學校應利用敎育的方法，培養學生正確的衛生觀念，陶鑄正當的衛生行爲，以增進敎育效能，並利用現代科學醫學的設備，預防學生疾病，保障學生健康，使學校環境充分合於衛生條件，全校敎職員及學生生活都有健康的保障，則屬至奉！</p>
<h3>關於醫藥衛生</h3>
<p>— 羅驤文</p>
<p>我國的醫藥衛生事業，近廿年來比校略有進步。但是談起來，實覺可憐。過去就沒有看見一個整個的計劃；就有計劃也沒有看到施行。何况以經費不足，人材缺乏，倡導無人。尤在抗戰時期，一切多以軍事爲前提。比較重要的部門，要興辦的事都未創辦。那有財力人力來辦醫藥衛生行政的事；受戰時環境的影響延吳一直到了今天。</p>
<p>勝利之後，已兩個年前；等待興辦的事，何祗千萬。然而因爲內戰的遷延，一切的一切仍然受着影響，未能加以改進和辦理；那裏還能注意到醫藥衛生行政的改進和建設。</p>
<p>最近政府改組，成立了衛生部；中華醫學會又在南京舉行第七屆會議；及本市衛生當局的醫務人員登記等消息；這些都是我們民族健康保障的福音。雖然我們列爲强國之一，死亡率的增加；公共衛生的落後；恐怕還是佔全世界的第一席吧。相信衛生當局負責調查統計的人，也不會否認的，</p>
<p>根據以上簡單的幾個理由；我們很希望下列的幾點，能引起衛生當局的注意改進；或澈底的計劃實施；以期有良好的收獲。</p>
<p>（一）整個的衛生行政計劃，想來當局早已擬定了，不容多說。我們祗希望如何能保障民族的健康，使死亡率逐漸减低。也就是說怎樣才能提高人民衛生享受的水準。尤其怎樣灌輸人民的常識及如何提倡，如何改進等問題。如果有經費，有人材，有計劃，我們就希望要澈底的做得到。形式上的紙上談兵，儘管有經費，有人材，有很好的計劃，不去做，也是不會收效的。這點我們要爲中華民族的前途而呼籲！</p>
<p>（二）我國現有的醫藥人員，大都是發展個人營業的多。因爲沒有實行公醫制度的關係，所以法弊太多。造成了有錢的人，就可以請醫生，買藥吃；貧苦的人就休想了。以上海一地而論，掛牌執行醫務的不知多少。如果政府有計劃，有組織。在抗戰時期的收獲，早有可觀，不待我們再討論了。現在倘能從此着手，尙不爲晚。將全國的醫藥人員加以統計組織起來，普及分配全國，深入農村。十年廿年之後，民族的健康得到保障。公共衛生能够發達，死亡率减低，不是可以預卜嗎。</p>
<p>（三）本市衛生當局舉行的醫事人員考詢辦法，倒是好的。不過我們可以預言，考詢的給果，是不會有好的成續的。因爲：考試的方法大有問題。若使不注意應考人的學歷服務年資，和臨床的經騐。而祗注意試卷上的答案；不啻忽略了應考人的實在才能，是不公平的。比方考得很好，往往有實地的經騐較差。或者服務多年，考卷不一定會可觀；這是定有的現象。要是現在正式執行業務的醫師，呌他來通通考一次，事質上那裏還會完全考得出。這些事實問題，都有硏究的必要。</p>
<p>（四）吾們認爲現在國內有數年服務的資歷，和相當的學歷，都應該讓他有繼續執行醫務的機會。當局的目光，應該遠大些。醫藥人員在上海是有餘；而全國的城市農村，就可憐了。試看沿長江一帶交通比較發達的縣鎭，醫藥的設備簡陋，人員的缺少，已很可慮。其他腹地，更是不堪設想。當局何勿澈底調配一下？就是上海出身的看護吧，假使他離開上海，以他們的所見所聞，相信也能担負起一個縣鎭或農村醫藥；人民健康的保障的。至少比所謂江湖賣草藥醫病的郞中，好些罷。能給以徵調樓會豈不比取締更好麼。</p>
<p>以上幾點，都是拉雜寫來。我們擁護當局有計劃，有人材，而能切實的去做。使人民的健康得到保障；醫藥衛生能逐漸發展；公共衛生日求進步；醫務人員能普及全國；這些都是極重要而應辦的事。爲中華民族的前途；爲後代子孫的健康，我們應該擁護政府，來倡導，來辦理！</p>
<h3>嬰兒營養</h3>
<p>— 江陽敏閑周德勤</p>
<p>白菜汁或各種靑菜汁作法：將菜葉洗凈切碎，菜二碗加水一碗，置鍋內蓋嚴，煮沸五分鐘，離火在鍋中浸半小時，濾去渣滓，即可。</p>
<p>（B）魚肝油：嬰兒滿月後可開始喂以魚肝油，以補乳中維生素丁之不足。最初一星期每天吃半茶匙，一星期後每天吃二次，每次半茶匙。再過一二星期後每天二次，每次一茶匙，以後維持此量。嬰兒四個月後，如在夏季實行日光浴，體內可自造丁種維生素，則可暫時减少魚肝油量。</p>
<p>（C）蛋黄青菜等：嬰兒在四五個月時，可加煮老之蛋黄，用以補充乳中鐵量之不足。開始時約加八分之一，逐漸增加，以後黄和白都可用。如不足月早產的嬰兒，胎兒期所吸收的鐵質比普通嬰兒少。一二個月內當進食肝湯（肝湯作法—肝三兩加水十兩，以文火燉三十分鐘。煮沸後立刻關火，過遞後用之。）等含鐵質豐富食品。自第五個月起，每日可加靑菜泥二次以供鐵質及其他鑛物質，維生棄等，同時亦有助排泄。初喂以一湯匙，漸增至四湯匙。</p>
<p>菜泥作法：將多葉菜蔬洗凈，切碎，加水少許，煮爛，擦過淸潔之鐵絲籲，除去渣滓後，籍下即爲菜泥。</p>
<p>（A）榖類食物：嬰兒初生時無消化澱粉能力，身體所需的炭水化物，由乳中乳糖供給。口液和腸液中漸漸發生消化澱粉之　。四個月時可給予過　後之粥，每天兩次，每次一湯匙，逐漸增加，至七僩月時，每次可吃四湯匙。在嬰兒初出牙時。應加烤　鏝首或餅乾一片，以磨練牙床。</p>
<p>（E）其他（碎肉末，碎肝，豆腐等）：自第六個月選，每日可喂以煮熟且　之水菓（香蕉不用煮），由二湯匙漸加至一整個，以供維生素。無機鹽及組織維。第九個月時可加入碎肉末，碎肝，豆腐等含有豐富蛋白質食物。歐美各國在八九個月時即開始斷乳，十個月或十一個月時即可完全斷盡。若遇炎夏，常延至秋凉。中國因牛乳缺乏，可延至一週歲後而開始。斷乳應用漸斷方法，先用牛乳或其他代乳品，或補充食物代替一次母乳。隔一星期再减一次，依次减少直至斷盡。有時因特別事故，必須於短期內斷盡者，第一日可用牛乳代替一次，第二日用牛乳代替二次。依次代替直至斷盡。有時必須立划斷乳時，如果嬰兒年齡在五六個月以下者，最好僱用乳母。否則用調製牛乳，起初牛乳含量應少，水量較多，以後牛乳成分日益加濃，至第十日時牛乳應增至應有成分。（續完）</p>

<p>天確實冷，黑妮的臉被風像刀子一樣的刮着，牙齒碰擊得，發出淸脆的聲音，鼻涕老是流淌着，用手擦一把，沒有一會兒，便又出來兩通。</p>
<p>當黑妮快走到車站的時候，迎面走來一羣放學回家的小學生，有的穿着鮮艷的毛衣，有的穿着黑大衣，都顯得像在春天一　的快活神氣。</p>
<p>黑妮是常常碰見這些小學生的，黑妮常常到車站附近拾煤渣。</p>
<p>小學生們看見黑妮凍的那個樣子，一個穿紅毛衣的小女孩便順口嘲笑起來；</p>
<p>「小黑妮</p>
<p>流鼻涕</p>
<p>沒有手絹擦鼻于</p>
<p>……」</p>
<p>黑妮裝作沒有聽見，垂着頭走着，想盡方法想使鼻涕不再流出來，鼻涕偏偏還是流淌着……</p>
<p>害得得黑妮幾乎哭起來。</p>
<p>黑妮曾經在心裏堅決的說：「死也不再上車站！」</p>
<p>但是，爲了吃飯，黑妮不能不硬着頭皮，依舊常常回車站去拾火車頭的排泄物。</p>
<p>春天了。小河的冰都溶化了。大地軟軟的可以踩出油來……黑妮的鼻涕不再流了。在車站上來去的黑妮，不再愁眉苦臉，她的頭抬了起來，而且：滾圓的大眼睛，閃射着光芒，美麗的微笑，一瓣一瓣的開放着，黑妮心頭有說不出的愉快。</p>
<p>這天，黑妮和她哥哥，在噴着濃烟人火車頭旁邊，拾了滿籃子滿破布袋煤渣。她哥哥呌她先把那一籃子煤渣送到家去，黑妮在鐵路旁邊呆了一會，便提起沉甸甸的籃子向家走去。汗水，在臉上湧流出來，愉快的黑妮，並不曾想到黏着滿臉煤灰的，自己的臉，是會那麽難看。但由於溫暖起來的天氣，由於一顆一顆的汗珠在滴落，她的心頭又生長了一個幻想，一個得到了一塊手絹的夢。</p>
<p>「只要一塊布的，能擦汗我就快活了!」黑妮自語着。「小黑妮，不害羞，臉不洗，醜醜醜！」</p>
<p>突然，又是黑妮所熟悉而又討厭的嘲笑聲，無情的匝面向黑妮擲來了……</p>
<p>黑妮身上的破棉　，脫了下來。太陽越來越溫暖，雖然才正是三月，却已有些初夏的味道了。</p>
<p>災人的陽光中，黑妮向車站走去，她的手不再縮在袖筒裏，擺來擺去，而是連蹦帶跳的走着，比冬天活潑得簡直看不出是一個孩子了。</p>
<p>望着這裏突破地売，讀出了一顆嫩芽；望着那裏在春風裏生長起來的一片綠草，黑妮正在走向車站的一條小路上，突然一塊蘋果綠的手絹發現在黑妮——一個渴想着得到一塊手絹的窮苦小女孩的面前，黑妮的突然站住，發呆，她不敢相信自己的眼睛。</p>
<p>「這是眞的嗎？」黑妮的腦子裏躍動着一大堆問號。</p>
<p>她看看四週，四週沒有什麽人，於是，像第一次作賊一樣，黑妮激動的灣壓拾起那塊手絹來，慌慌張張的塞到衣袋裏，黑妮又向四週窺望了一眼，這一次依然沒有看見什麽人，她才稍微安靜了一些。</p>
<p>但是，安靜和喜悅，在黑妮是多麽短暫呵！黑妮的腦子活動起來了：她個憶起來自己的幻想，幻想得到一塊手絹是有的，但却一次也不曾想過將來屬於自己的手絹，要從路上檢來。她回憶起來，在一次鄕　的廟會上，有一個扒手被捉住後，被吊打的慘然。……</p>
<p>黑妮想着走着，越想越覺得不該拾起這塊手絹，實在衣袋裏的手絹，像石頭一樣的沉重，　的黑妮難受；像針刺一樣，扎的心痛。黑妮忽然感到：沒有手絹擦鼻涕擦汗，並不丢人，去拾一塊別人丢掉了的手絹才眞難爲情！自己用時，如果旁人看見，一定會說是自己偸的呢！</p>
<p>於是，黑妮掏出那塊蘋果錄的手絹來，把手高舉起來在頭頂搖　。</p>
<p>「誰的手絹？誰丟的手絹？」黑妮高聲呼喚着。</p>
<p>一個歪戴着舊禮帽的人走來，冷冷的一笑，露出兩顆金牙齒。這鑲金牙的人，仲手把手絹抽走，並不理踩黑　，向車站走去。</p>
<p>黑妮雖然有些懷疑：這塘　果綠的手親，就是這個令人看見厭煩的傢伙丢掉的，但是，像遠邊的躱開了向窮人吠科的狗一樣，當手絹從她的手裏，落到另一個人的手裏時，她心裏得到了眞正的安寗。</p>

<h3>蕪草漫漫掇　書懷六絕</h3>

<h3>孔士當德大帝之首</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>紀元前四世紀之初葉，在羅馬市中心，想來是建立了無數的大小雕像的。兩軀巨像高達廿二英呎至卅二英呎，除去八十軀鍍金神像，七十三軀黄金象牙神像之外，尙有三千七盲八十五軀之銅像；大理石像之多，已不能以數字計。孔士當德大帝石像即爲其中之一。</p>
<p>此首與其他殘缺部份都是在巴芨利卡之南隅發掘出來的。法王英諾欽八世（一四八四——九三）。時收藏子卡比德宮。其頸部下端作成楔形狀，足證此爲一巨大紀念像之頭部。額髮横斷成溝處，可以想象當時尙藏有金屬皇冠。據史家的判斷，此像可能是孔士當德大帝的坐像，首與手足均爲大理石。此作現存羅馬，其高大倘以坐像論，至少應爲三十二英尺，攝影時下坐一少女，其高度尙不及該像面部，全身之高大當可想見矣。</p>
<h3>紫色的螢光</h3>
<p>— 謝紫</p>
<p>我老是想，假如我得到了靈感，我　要寫成一部完美的作品。這作品在我心裏醞釀着，孵育着，却一直沒有具體的形象。我把它當作生命的一部，思想的全部，我把它當作一件永生的贈禮。然而這工作太嚴肅了，太嚴肅了，偶一想及，就不免有一種歡喜而又恐懼的戰慄。</p>
<p>其實這作品是否會產生，倒並不要緊。那靈感到底是怎樣一件東西，我也不大明白；我只是矇職的感覺到，那靈感終有一天會來的。有一天，它會像一道强烈的陽光，射透了我思想的雲層，使我在那璀璨的光華中，重新識自己，重新體騐生命。那時候，我將要寫成一部完美的作品，不，我的生命將要被寫成一部完美的作品。我的生命還有着知許空白，等待那疾風暴雨般的文字！</p>
<p>我不知道在這樣的等待中，在這樣渺渺茫茫的等待中，我的才華是否會枯萎。我甚至於想，一定要到我才華枯萎的時候，這靈感才會來。假如眞是如此的話，我倒情願它早一點枯萎，情願它苗而不秀，秀而不實。我情願用這一點可憐的才華換取靈感，用這一點紫色的螢光，換取燦爛的陽光。我對於生命有一個過分美麗的憧憬，這憧憬迫使我作這一種犧牲，作這一種抉擇，這犧牲不是委曲；這抉擇不是錯誤。我情願在作品中生活，而不願在生活中寫作。</p>
<p>然而我又想，到了才華枯萎的時候，我是否還會認識那靈感呢？滿眼陽光對於一個盲者，是不是一個殘酷的諷刺呢？那時候該是一片迷濛的白光：看不見飛島，看不見花朶，看不見人世的浮華和昇華；一切都看不見。二個才華枯萎的人，即使走到伊甸園中，也找不到他所憧憬的美麗，他所渴望的歡樂的。因爲他連這一點憧憬，這一點飢渴，都統統喪失了</p>
<p>於是我提醒自己，還是快一點，快一點吧！再晚就來不及了。人生禁不起一再跎蹉的，走過這一村就沒有那一店了。我必須立刻決定，火急追趕，我必須把過去的犧牲和抉擇全部改過。可是想來想去，我總覺得缺少一種鼓勵。缺少一種動力。</p>
<p>有時我又想，假如我能够得到一個知己，一個眞實的知己，藉着他的力量，驅除我的懶散；藉着他的明快，趕走我的躊躇；　或者單憑那一點感恩知己之情，我可以得到重生的勇氣，自己慰勉，自己惕勵，馬上呵筆伸紙，舖錦列籲的製作起來。</p>
<p>然而在這世界上，知己是不容易到得的，大家都忙着尋找知已，而却不願去知道旁人。結果大家都找不到知己，也不能做旁人的知己。在孤零無奈中，只有執地着自憐自嘆，自暴自棄！</p>
<p>最後我還是想起了那一點紫色的螢光，只有它是我自己的；在黑暗中照亮了我的路，在寂寞中陪伴着我，我怎忍，我怎忍把它摧毁呢？</p>

<h3>看戲</h3>
<p>— 田濟</p>
<p>「是多少人在做戲，又是多少人專在看戲呵！」從天蟾舞台出來，走在前面的友人不勝感慨地說。</p>
<p>我不知道這感慨是因什麽發的，我也沒去迫　。在細雨中踏着油滑的馬路，走過一段後即揚手吿別了。</p>
<p>回家雖然已是午夜以後了，躺在床上却總睡不着，「是多少人在做戲呵！」沒來由的忽然想起了友人的話，也同情起他的感慨來了。</p>
<p>隔壁的鐘已敲了一下，兩限却越發淸醒，爲了想擠出腦子中一些雜亂的思想，拾起了囊放在床頭上的一本小說，是蒲留仙的「醒世姻緣」，開着的地方正是劉錦衣扭設法使他唱戲的外甥做官的一段：「也是我們做外公做舅舅的一塲，就呌他兩個也就歇了這行生意，喚他進京來，扶持他做個前程，選個州縣佐貳，雖是抵搭，也還强似戲塲上的假官。」</p>
<p>眞湊巧，又是唱戲。劉錦衣的想法也怪，戲塲上的假官竟可做世間的處官。那末，眞是「舞台小乾坤，乾坤大舞台一了。又仔細想想，也不足爲怪，明末唐王在廣州稱帝，一日除官數千，冠服就是全假之優伶的，蓋舞台與乾坤合爲一家已不自今日始了。</p>
<p>「舞台小乾坤，乾坤大舞台」這兩句話不知最初是誰想出來的。今日雖已成濫調，一經細想意味是還頗爲雋永的，不是說從「出將」「入相」兩個門出出進進活像眞事，而舞台的前台和後台，眞也像一個小乾坤的表面和內裏</p>
<p>披紈裹素，嬉笑怒駡，不到後合，不知內幕，是不曉得這裏邊藏着多少血和淚以及犧牲了多少靑春和生命的。</p>
<p>「伐子都」中那個武生爲什麼一個人單獨地演那末許多把式呢？那些拿生命換來的本事，在這裏是顯得這末多多餘，若看戲和看玩把式是兩回事的話，我感覺舊劇中類乎「伐子都」中這些把式就應該取消，那也就是說，可省却若干血淚和生命。</p>
<p>思想漸漸地翻到了一年前在復員途中所見的一幕。那時困在一個縣城中整整一個月的時間，旅館的後院住着一個戲班子。從樓上後窗望下去，可以看到一個肥頭肥腦約四十多歲的男子敎一個八九歲的女孩子在平地上兩脚向天，兩手着地，倒豎了起來。姿勢擺好後，那個大槪屬於老闆一類的人物就端起他的小茶壶去和別人扯淡。女孩子倒豎在那裏，有時半點，一點，或竟一點多鐘。我回頭坐下看一會書，再到窗前看看，常是還在那裏豎着。這來樣，一天幾次，一次幾點鐘，放下來休息不到五分鐘又得再豎起來：這大概就是所謂練功夫了。有時兩條豎着的腿只打頭，倘被老闆瞥到，險立刻變成鐵靑色，隨着籐鞭落在身上，若因被打而倒下來，那籐鞭便會驟雨似地落下去。</p>
<p>以後的姿勢是她豎着兩腿被向背後彎下去，直到兩脚着地。我隔窗看到每天她都有個放手放脚的印子，這印子的距離越來越近，直到差不多銜接了起來。那女孩子也更每次都眼裏噙着淚了。</p>
<p>「還哭呢！這末無用。」一天，我正坐着在看一本小說，這聲音將我引到了窗子上，接着而來的自然是乒乓地籐鞭聲。</p>
<p>我更記起前些年頭看過的幾次其實是祇玩人的馬戲團，得到的是嫩弱的生命的被摧殘被迫害的刺激。我疑心這是只給虐害狂者看的玩藝，普通人是只有帶回不快去的。從那後我就不再看這類無馬的馬戲了。却沒料到「小乾坤」後面也是這末一幕。爲了這事，我終日心理鬱悶着。一天一個新認識的旅伴到我房裏來，我指給他看並說出了心中的感想。</p>
<p>「都是這末着，不練身子不靈活。」奇怪的是他竟一點也不以爲怪。接着哼了起來，也是京戲。</p>
<p>「你奇怪麽？」他歇了唱問我。</p>
<p>我沒有回答。我只想，唱戲眞和人生一樣：唱戲就是人生，學戲也是人生，而整個人生就是在唱戲。</p>
<p>鐘已敲了兩下。那位朋友的話又在耳中響了起來，「是多少人在做戲，又是多少人專在看戲呵！」</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血521</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「噓吁……」守一輕輕放出一個唿哨。</p>
<p>「噓吁吁……？」有人在側邊暗處答應着。</p>
<p>「09……？」守一對準暗號來處問着。</p>
<p>「……15。」答聲未畢，就有一個瘦小個子，一閃身跑近汽車身邊來。</p>
<p>「辛苦辛苦！」守一對來人慰勞着。</p>
<p>「您辛苦，！」來人接腔了；「前面一百碼不到，我們還有一個小哨站，過了那一站，就是一個荒塲；走過荒塲，那座小洋房就是窩子；根據報吿，屋上架着探照燈和輕汽槍。」來人的聲音尖俏，頗像一個女子說話聲音。</p>
<p>『謝謝，……我們這邊可有人來過？』守一顯得有些焦切。</p>
<p>『我這一站，一小時以內，絕對沒有自己人經過。就連對方，或不相干的人，也只有三五個人走過，大槪都是本地人。』</p>
<p>「這裏就是虹鎭嗎」？鶴見探問着。　了上海，他似乎變成了一個鄕下人。</p>
<p>「那荒塲朝北二三百碼，就是虹鎭邊界」。小個子答應了。</p>
<p>「那麼，假使有人繞這從虹鎭那邊過來，進入匪窟，您這一站可能看得出嗎」？鶴見問着虹鎭，原來是有用意的。</p>
<p>「繞道也行，可是比較這條路要遠出三分之一，並且都是小路，不能行車。…但也可以決定沒有咱們自己人，從那邊走入匪窟…」</p>
<p>「怎麽知道」？守一問。</p>
<p>「有兩個簡單理由；第一，咱們那邊也有哨綫，如有自己人過去，必有信號發出。可是我沒有聽見信號。第二，如有人侵入匪窩，恐怕不能那們安靜，連槍聲都聽不到一下。似乎不可能」。</p>
<p>「簡直沒有一點驚動嗎」？守一仍舊有些信不過。</p>
<p>「至少從我這一方說，沒有些微驚動…東頭，在窩子以東二三百碼以外，我們也植下一兩個哨綫，不知道可有什麽消息：因距離這裏太遠，當中又隔着這個窩子，不願驚動牠，所以約定不傳消息，除非過分重要，過分緊急的消息」。…</p>
<p>『難道對方竟不佈置防綫』？鶴見想到了對方的冷靜。</p>
<p>『對方的實力，大槪都在窩子裏；外面沒有崗位，只有流動巡哨，五六個人一組；半小時前巡過一度，態度嘻嘻哈哈地，一些也不嚴重；可以推想窩子要，必也不甚緊張—也許他們認爲沒有人敢來抄査窩子…只是力量却相當厚實」。</p>
<p>『我打算到窩子裏去探査一下」。守一商量鶴見。</p>
<p>「我也去」！鶴見很堅決。</p>
<p>「那麽，同路還是分途」？守一要看看鶴見的胆量。</p>
<p>『都可以吧！只看哪種動作有利益』。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>波歇斯敎授說得好：「這一切華美的新街道和橋樑對我有什麽用呢？假如我在那上面不能照着我所喜歡的去想。」</p>
<p>我覺得思想比呼吸對於人更爲必要。你能想像一個人停止呼吸五分鐘後的模樣嗎？你能想像一個人被禁止自由思想後的痛苦嗎？</p>
<p>我又不禁聯想起一段故事。</p>
<p>恐怕是古希臘的事情。有一個智慧的人，他最早悟到地是圓的，可是這種說法，是違背當時的崇神觀念的。於是掌握生命大權的祭司把這智慧者抓起來。然後用刀架在他的頸上，要他承認自己的荒謬，並且忠實地高呼：「地是方的！」這樣，刀才能離開他的頭，不然，刀就要掠過他的頸；身首異處。</p>
<p>「我可以這樣說，地是方的。」智慧者從容地說。刀剛要離開他的頸時，他又接着坦然地說：「然而，然而事實上地是圓的。」刀終於掠過了智慧者的頭。</p>
<p>荒謬的是那把祭司的刀，誰說那把刀能把眞理殺害呢？</p>
<p>這位智慧者首先燭照了我們黝黯的人類歷史。至於他的死，只是明示我們，一切先知必然的命運而已。</p>
<p>歌德說得好：「對於一切我都太老了，除了對於眞理。」</p>

<h3>血的教訓　為五卅紀念作</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>二十二年前的今日，上海的局面一樣的在動盪，那表面嚴重的狀態，較之今日的上海只有過之。從上海日本內外棉織會社的工頭顧正紅被槍殺到南京路血案的激發，整個的中國立即匯成一道反帝的怒潮。大革命前夜的羣中，不但在行動上作出有力的呼聲，而且在實踐上震驚了帝國主義者的心胆。當時所掀起的對英日的杯葛運動，直使外貨無法在中國各地露見。</p>
<p>五卅事件在外交上我們是失敗的；因爲帝國主義者只不過賠償死難者一筆有限的卹金而已。但從反帝鬥爭這一角度上看，這却是弱小民族第一顆反抗的炸彈。自上海血案以後，接着就有漢口的「六一一慘案」，有「六二三」的廣州沙面血案。帝國主義者固然到處露出他的猙獰面目，施以武力的壓迫，但這却促成中國工人的團結，一九二五—二六年穗港近十萬工人的長期罷工，實可說奠定了中國以後革命統一的</p>
<p>去血的敎訓中，我們知道鬥爭的陣綫必須要求統一；其次，鬥爭的目的，必然是代表多數民衆的利益。要是違反了這兩個基本原則，犧牲的代價旣不値得；自然也講不到成功。五卅事件發生後，所以能立即震動全國，各地各界都起來支援，就是大家基於同一的認識，同一的利害，同一的目標。因此，大家也始終在同一崗位上一致努力。</p>
<p>現在日本帝國主義已經倒下去了，列强在中國的不平等條約也相繼的撤銷。然而中國今日的局面仍未露出一綫光明。南京路上的紅頭巡捕雖已絕跡，可是沒有人敢否認南京路上的空氣是和平的。我們聽到看到的都是一片慘酷的聲色！人心的窒悶與苦痛是二十二年前一樣的深重。</p>
<p>尤其可悲的是，在這苦悶的氣氛中，許多人都已近乎麻木，他們的情緒已走向下坡，雖然憤懣，但只有嘆息。</p>
<p>値茲血的紀念，緬懷先烈的流血，將使我們加倍的警愓里</p>
<h3>兩極只有一個方向？</h3>
<p>— 蔣菊舲</p>
<p>爲了兩極的方向問題，我和友人淡烟君爭論了大半天。我說兩極只有一個方向；（北極只有南，南極只有北）而淡烟君却「聰明一世，慒懂一時』地固執着說也有東西南北，於是爭論就此開始。我用一個皮球來很定甫北兩極，而證明只有一個方向的對，然後淡烟君表示「屈服」，辯論我是勝利了。根據理論，我又說明當一隻飛機飛到南極或北極時，指南針的指向必然有一百八十度的轉變了；淡烟君又大不爲然的加以否認了。但是當我在皮球上畫了在地球反向的上海和紐約兩個地方，飛機從上海經過北極而到紐約，如果指南針不變方向而成爲「指北針」時，淡烟君又認輸了。不過她說，當飛機到兩極的「極點」（註）時，指南針則被停住或旋轉不定，直至飛過「極點」，才有一百八十度的轉變；沒有「飛過」而僅「飛到」時是不可能有正確的轉變的。我仔細想了想，認爲她說的很有道理，因爲那時四面都是南方的緣故。</p>
<p>這都是理論的爭辯，在實際上究竟如何，要待探險家環行地球南北一周而定；况且南極地方究竟有多大，還是一個謎。你只要稍微察看東西兩半球的地圖，注意赤道的南北兩面水陸分佈的遠差，就好懷疑南極可能有極大的一塊陸地了，而且我們只有環繞過地球東西一週，而還沒有經過兩極的南北環行的記錄呀！</p>
<p>（註）這是淡烟君指兩極的</p>
<p>「極端點」，而非幾何學上</p>
<p>「極點」「極綫」的「極點」。</p>

<h3>讀「中國抗戰書史」</h3>
<p>— 風雲</p>
<p>容我爲讀者介紹戰後這一部歷史文獻的巨著：曹聚仁舒宗僑著的「中國抗戰書史」。我們，踏過鮮血砲火連綿的八年戰爭，應該回顧去看看我們過去所走艱辛漫長的道路，那些火光熊熊，血淚悽楚的畫面中間，確蘊藏着多少値得我們借鏡，値得我們敎訓的意義在。</p>
<p>日本是戰敗了，一個想憑藉「强權」「暴力」的法西斯蒂的崇拜者，而今屆服匍匐於世界「正義」「公道」之前，這自然是當然的事；但我們不得不引爲隱憂的，世界和平後才一年多光景，當全他界被戰火灼傷的人民，餘痛尙未消退的今天，而到處又可聞到火藥的氣息；兩大壁壘的對峙；相互間的猜忌和疑懼與戒備；這些，難道就是世界戰爭帶給我們唯一的敎訓麽？</p>
<p>我們且以日本爲例子，在麥克阿瑟元帥養護之下，她的輕工業已逐漸恢復原狀，她的出口貿易又將侵蝕到遠東；而日本國民要求國內最低限度的軍備，也煌煌然地被視爲不足驚奋的事件了。</p>
<p>但在二年中的中國，當我翻閱着包括四十萬字巨著的「中國抗戰畫史」的時候，我不能不慨嘆我們的徬徨與不安了。</p>
<p>中國在遠東，在亞洲，在整個世界的東半球上，她應該是世界和平的定力，當全世界疑懼第三次大戰又將蒞臨人間的時候，全世界人民對於中國的期望多麼殷切，他們不單希望中國走上和平幸福之路，並且希望中國眞正能够做到美國與蘇聯之間的橋樑，使世界許多誤解與紛擾，變成祥瑞與玉帛。</p>
<p>這正如本書着者在「扉頁」裏特別提到的：『我們以長期抗戰的重大犧牲所爭得來的「四强」地位，便在戰爭結束這一年間，由「五强」降而被擯於「四强」之外了，我們看看自己在國際上的地位，想想今後太平洋上正在醖　中的惡局勢，前途黯淡，不堪設想。」</p>
<p>這種慨乎言之的心情，不只是代表本書作者心境之一斑吧。</p>
<p>「中國抗戰畫史」共四百四十八頁，圖片一千餘幅，全書共分十章，所根據的戰史力求眞實，記敍則能做到客觀公正，許多材料，都是引用第三者的記載與著作，盡力避免主觀上的判斷，這一點，應該是全書最可珍貴之處。</p>
<p>附錄中的「抗戰史料述評」，這是著者說明他處理素材的態度與方法，很可作爲一切編篡著作的參考。</p>
<p>這一部包括中國抗戰八年最可珍貴的詩史，每一個讀者，是應該珍藏一部的。</p>

<p>抗戰初，段老太太帶了白象逃難到大後方。勝利後，又帶了牠復員到上海，與我的次女林先及吾婿宋慕法鄰居。不知爲了甚麼原因，段老太太把白象和牠的獨子小白象寄交林先慕法家，變成了他們的愛貓。我到上海，林先慕法又把白象寄交我，關在一隻無錫麵筋的籠裏，上火車，帶回杭州，住在西湖邊上的小屋裏，變成了我家的愛貓。</p>
<p>白象眞是可愛的貓！不但爲了牠渾身雪白，偉大如象，又爲了牠的眼睛一黄一藍，呌做「日月眼」。牠從太陽光裏走來的時候，瞪孔細得幾乎沒有，兩眼竟像話劇舞合上所裝置的兩只光色不同的電燈，見者無不驚奇讚歎。收電燈費的人看見了牠，幾乎忘記拿鈔票；查戶口的警察看見了牠，也暫時不査了。</p>
<p>白象到我家後，慕法林先常寫信來，說段老太太已遷居他處，但常常來他們家訪問小白象，目的是探問白象的近況。我的幼女一吟，同情於段老太太的離愁，常常給白象拍照，寄交林先轉交段老太太，以慰其相思。同時對於白象，更增愛護。每天一吟讀書回家，或她的大姊陳寳敎課回家，一坐倒，白象就跳到她們的膝上，老實不客氣地睡了。她們不忍拒絕，就坐着不動，向人要茶，要永，要換鞋，要報看。有時工人不在身邊，我同老妻就當聽差，送茶，送水，送鞋，送報。我們實在是服侍白象。</p>
<p>有一天，白象不見了。我們征騎四出，遍尋不得。正在躭憂，牠偕同一隻斑花貓，悄悄地回來了。大家驚喜。女　秀英說，這是招賢寺裏雄貓。說過笑起來。經過一個短促的休止符，大家都笑起來。原來牠是到和尙寺裏去找戀人去了，也不關照一聲，害得我們急死。</p>

<p>有一句很自然的答覆湧到了老祝的口邊，結果却沒有說出來，因爲他不愛在這個時候，再用言語去打擊這個已經失敗的發國難財者。</p>
<p>「外行，內行，這時候我們還是不要談的好」。他把諷刺的成份竭力减低，然而徐紹明的臉已經漲紅了。「倒是老兄現在打算怎麽樣？有什麽事要我這個窮光蛋給你跑腿的沒有」？</p>
<p>徐紹明很感慨地苦笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「我現在也沒有什麽打算。反正我已經什麼都完了，逃難不逃難並無關係」。他用力搓着自己的雙手。「只是那許多貨色總不能白丢。方才他們軍隊裏有人來關照過，凡這一次因子彈車爆炸而受到損失的商家，祗要提得出證據，他們可以多少賠償一些。好在我的貨全上帳，帳簿沒有燒掉……」。</p>
<p>老祝也很明瞭他們這些標準商人的心理：「金錢至上，貨色第一」。自己在這方面既沒有可以給他效勞的，還是不加顧問的好。</p>
<p>「我是到鎭上來找車子的，看這情形大槪世得伴老兄在這兒住上幾天咧」！對於這類人，當然祗能隨便敷衍幾句，而事實上，老祝的心裏也眞焦透了；眼看快十一點鐘了，再過兩個鐘點找不到車子，今天就不用想動身。別人還可，害着重病的蘭將如何呢？因此他決定立刻再回公路童站去，等候路過的便車。徐胖子也不留他，將分手時，老祝忍不住補上了一句：</p>

<p>徐紹明沒精打彩地朝他揮揮手，依舊走回他原來所坐的瓦爍堆上去，老祝對他說的話，像沒有聽見一樣。</p>
<p>在心底裏發出了一聲鄒夷的冷笑之發，祝兆年立刻放開脚步急走。</p>

In addition, the special committee established to review the proposals on peace issues will convene a review meeting after the review work of other groups has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Councilor Raises Improvement Suggestions on Military and National Defense Work</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] At a time when the national border defenses are not yet consolidated, and local order is still in turmoil, some councilors have put forward important suggestions for improving military and national defense work. According to a councilor who participated in the first review committee on the 29th, the general consensus focuses on the following seven points: (1) The military reorganization policy should be changed to meet current needs. (2) Efforts should be made to improve the weaknesses of the army. (3) Enrich local military forces and strive for coordination with military administration. (4) Various forms of compensation should be handled effectively. (5) The more than 250,000 retired officers should be properly resettled as soon as possible. (6) Military academy students should be recruited as much as possible. (7) Efforts should be made to recover Harbin quickly. Regarding the first point, he said: They generally advocate that the military reorganization policy should be to strive for the realization of elite troops, enrich their quality, strengthen existing troops, improve quality, and strengthen training, and to coordinate military strength with spiritual, political, and material mobilization in order to achieve the task. There should be no regional factionalism in the selection of reorganization. Regarding improving weaknesses, it is generally advocated to increase military spending, improve treatment, eliminate malpractices, correct military discipline, and pay attention to the ability and prestige of commanders. Retired officers are all soldiers who have contributed to the war of resistance. They should be quickly subsidized to return to their hometowns, and local governments should be given work opportunities or production subsidies. As for the Harbin issue, the area was originally the gateway to northeastern China and has now been occupied by the Communist army as a supply channel, which has a great impact on the military situation in the Northeast. Questions were raised and discussed at the review meeting, and it was hoped that the government would quickly seek recovery to cut off the source of trouble and comfort the people's aspirations. This opinion will be submitted to the General Assembly for approval and forwarded to the government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>Currency Reform Issue to Be Implemented After the Overall Situation Stabilizes; Councilor Bao Yimin Asks for Cultural Loans</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun said when attending the fourth review meeting of the Council on the 29th to report on the government's financial measures: currency reform and changing the currency unit should wait until the overall situation stabilizes, but the government is prepared for this. If the system is changed rashly and inflation continues in the future, the government will not be able to establish credit, and it will not help. Before the reform, the government must exchange sufficient foreign exchange.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Councilor Bao Yimin believes that the current culture has a downward trend and that the country should urgently handle cultural loans to support the publishing industry in order to improve the country's cultural level and promote social progress. Bao has drafted a proposal to send to the People's Political Council, with several methods as follows: (1) The government orders the national banks to set up cultural loans. (2) The loan targets are divided into two types: publishing industry and authors. Those with good reputation and whose works are considered to have publishing value may apply for loans. (3) The loan interest rate and term are equal to or better than industrial loans. (4) The loan and procedures for authors to publish should be relaxed as much as possible.</p>
<h3>The Communist Personnel of the Executive Headquarters Refuse to Forward the Invitation Telegram of the Council, Saying That the Interruption of Contact Is Not an Accurate Statement</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Communist Party personnel stationed in the Executive Headquarters replied to the People's Political Council in the name of the "Relief Headquarters" Shanghai office that the Yantai Executive Headquarters radio station has no contact with any Communist radio station and refused to send a telegram from the Council inviting the Communist councilors to Beijing. According to a political observer interviewed by the reporter, this is just an excuse for the Communist Party to refuse to attend the Council and refuse to resume peace talks, but it is not actually the case. It is found that the recent broadcasts of the Communist radio station all have news from Yantai. For example, the broadcast on the 15th of this month contained "Rapid Development Report of Industry and Commerce in Yantai City", and the 22nd contained "Sharp Drop in Foreign Exchange in Yantai City" and "Industry and Commerce in Yantai City" and other telegrams. Regardless of where the telegrams were sent from within Shandong Province, it can be seen that the contact between Yantai and the Communist Party headquarters has not been interrupted. The telegrams from Shanghai to the Communist councilors can still be indirectly delivered. The so-called inability to comply with the request to forward telegrams by the Communist Party personnel in Shanghai is nothing more than a deception.</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Is Still Recuperating</h3>
<p>He Hopes to Visit the Northeast</p>
<p>[Our Report] Mo Dehui is still recuperating at Zhongshan Hospital. His blood pressure has decreased and his spirits are good. He told reporters that the date of going to Beijing is undecided and everything depends on his health. After being away from Beijing for many days, he is out of touch with current affairs and needs to discuss with all parties before he can make any claims. However, peace and unity are inseparable, and which comes first is only a technical issue. Mo is eager to go to the Northeast after his strength recovers. He also said: The Northeast issue is of great importance. The Second World War originated in the Northeast. Efforts to solve the internal affairs problem can solve the Northeast problem. As far as international relations are concerned, there must be "interactions" and "involvements" between countries, so there is no need to overemphasize it. When talking about peace talks, Mo said: It may be too late to attend the People's Political Council. He hopes to have a meeting with all the councilors in Shanghai. Restoring peace talks is not a simple matter and is not a matter for one person or one party.</p>
<h3>The Organizational Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party Elects Xu Chuanlin as a Member of the Government Council</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Has Expressed His Acceptance</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Xu Fulin, Minister of Publicity of the Democratic Socialist Party, was decided by the organizational committee of the party yesterday to be recommended as a member of the National Government Council. Xu has expressed his acceptance.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The organizational committee of the Democratic Socialist Party held meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, chaired by Ji Yiqiao and Hu Haimen, respectively, and passed many proposals such as refreshing party affairs and adjusting personnel. Sun Baogang, Lu Guangsheng, Zai Shiming, and other party members who violated party discipline and participated in the Innovation Committee were unanimously approved to be expelled from the party membership and handed over to the Central Supervisory Committee for investigation and handling in accordance with Article 5 of the party's organizational law. Regarding the issue of the quorum of the organizational committee, it was also resolved to follow the precedent of the Second Organizational Committee Congress, with more than half of the number of committee members as the quorum. The party is scheduled to convene the Supervisory Committee this morning to determine the number of people to be expelled, and continue the general meeting in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Organization Regulations of the Design and Evaluation Office Are Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The regulations on the organization of the National Government Design and Evaluation Office were finally passed at the 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th after repeated review and discussion by the Legislative Yuan. The biggest change in the articles passed this time is to change the original Article 1, which stipulated the responsibilities of the office, which included the design and evaluation of political and economic affairs, etc., to "the design and evaluation of national administration affairs." Liu Kejun, chairman of the legal system committee, said when explaining the review process: When the case was discussed at the General Assembly and the review committee, the legislators all believed that the office was a staff organization for the chairman, and the National Economic Commission was in charge of the design of economic policies, so there were the above changes. A larger change here is to reduce the number of staff, which was originally quite large, as much as possible. According to the three organizational regulations passed today, the National Government Design and Evaluation Office will set up a design bureau, an evaluation bureau, and a secretariat, with one design and evaluation director, one director and one deputy director for the design bureau, and one director and one deputy director for the old evaluation bureau.</p>
<h3>The Amendment to the Trade Union Law Is Passed; The Clause on Restricting Strikes Has Been Deleted</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The amendment to the Trade Union Law has completed the legislative process after fierce debate at the 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th. The full text of the law has 63 articles. After it was proposed, Chen Xiaocen, convener of the Labor Law Committee, first explained the main points of the law, roughly saying that after this amendment, trade unions began to have national organizations. As for workers joining trade unions, the draft does not adopt a registration system, but a permission system. Regarding the issue of strikes, the draft stipulates that workers in public utilities and transportation industries are not allowed to strike, and it is stipulated that wages will not be paid during the strike period. Then the discussion began. Most legislators believed that the restrictions on strikes should not be too strict, and advocated deleting the last two clauses of Article 28 regarding strikes. President Sun also believed that strikes by public utility and transportation workers should not be prohibited, because such regulations are not in line with modern trends and violate democratic principles. He also cited examples to illustrate that if the law prohibits strikes by public utility and transportation workers, how should strikes by coal mine and other power workers be handled? Is it not contradictory to only prohibit the former and allow coal mine workers to strike? Legislation should adapt to the spirit of the times, and the above two clauses should be deleted. Chen Guyuan and others also believed that wages should still be paid to strikers to show sympathy. The final resolution was to delete the two clauses, and there were no major changes to the other clauses, and the entire case was passed. (The full text of the Trade Union Law will be published on the seventh edition of the 31st)</p>
<h3>The Legislative Yuan Holds All-Day Meeting; Approves the Sino-American Air Transport Agreement After Amending the Internal Organization Law; Minister of Agriculture Attends to Report on the Work Overview</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan was held all day on the 29th due to the large number of bills and fierce debates. The meeting opened at 9:30 am and adjourned at 1 pm. It resumed at 3:30 pm and adjourned at about 5 pm. Both meetings were chaired by President Sun, and more than 100 legislators attended. At the morning meeting, Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng attended to answer questions related to agriculture and forestry. Ten important cases were passed today, the main ones being: (1) the Organization Law of the National Government Design and Evaluation Office, (2) the amendment to the Trade Union Law, (3) the amendment to the Stamp Tax Law, (4) the amendment to the Organization Law of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, (5) the Sino-American Air Transport Agreement, and (6) the Sino-Afghanistan Treaty of Friendship. The issue of the number of occupational representatives among the legislators was also discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] At the 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 29th, the new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, gave a brief report on the work overview of the ministry, roughly saying that the ministry has more than 40 affiliated institutions. Due to limited funding and manpower, the work has not been as ideal as expected. However, some institutions have achieved considerable work performance due to the proper coordination of talents, even though funding is tight. The cotton industry institutions in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places are examples. Zuo believes that if agricultural and forestry work only starts from production and does not pay attention to research work, confusion will inevitably occur and will affect production. According to the results of his inspection in the two weeks since taking office, he knows that research work, although it seems too circuitous, is not to be blamed. Some legislators inquired about the messy organization of the Ministry of Agriculture, the inconsistent authority, and the unreasonable division of power between the central and local governments, hoping to improve.</p>
<h3>The Number of Occupational Representatives Among Legislators Is Handed Over to the Two Committees for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The issue of increasing the number of occupational representatives among legislators was proposed for reconsideration at the afternoon meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th. Since there were still points worthy of discussion in terms of procedure, it was decided to hand it over to the Constitutional Law Committee and the Legal System Committee for discussion first. After the case was proposed at the meeting on the 29th, Liu Kejun, chairman of the Constitutional Law Committee, first reported on the review process, roughly saying that the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators had been passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. The National Government believed that it was necessary to increase the number of occupational representatives among legislators, so it handed over the case to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The Constitutional Law Committee held a meeting for discussion on the 27th. The opinions at the meeting can be roughly summarized into the following categories: (1) According to Article 4 of the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators, the total number of legislators has reached more than 700, which is already extremely large and should not be increased further. (2) The original article stipulates that the number of occupational representatives is 56, which is determined by referring to one-tenth of the number of regional representatives. Now that the number of regional representatives has increased to 670, the number of occupational representatives can be increased proportionally to 67. (3) In accordance with the order of the National Government, the number of occupational representatives will be increased to 110. (4) According to 15% of the total number of legislators, which is more than 670, the number of occupational representatives will be increased to 102. (5) The number of occupational representatives will be determined according to the number of members of national professional groups. (6) A decision will not be made temporarily and will be sent to the General Assembly for discussion. In the end, it was decided to adopt the sixth method. The Constitutional Law Committee did not make any resolution on the matter and only sent the case to the General Assembly for a decision. After Liu finished reporting, Liu Butong, a legislator, first spoke and expressed his disagreement with increasing the number of occupational representatives, and gave five reasons to explain that even if it were increased, it could only be increased from 56 to 67. Legislator Lu Fu pointed out the difference between reconsideration and amendment. It is said that if there are places that need to be corrected in the content of the law before it completes the legislative process and is promulgated, and it is submitted to the legislative body for discussion again, it is called "reconsideration." If the law has completed the legislation and has been promulgated and implemented, it is called "amendment" if there is a need to make further amendments and it is submitted to the legislative body for discussion. The nature of the two is completely different. The Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators has long been completed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government on March 31 this year. The National Government has recently handed over the number of occupational representatives among legislators to the Legislative Yuan for "reconsideration," and the procedure is somewhat inconsistent. Moreover, even if there is no reconsideration and the Legislative Yuan is ordered to amend the law, it is also inconsistent with the law. According to international practice, the laws passed by the current session cannot be amended again in the same session. Moreover, since the promulgation of the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators, no flaws have been found, and there is a need for the Legislative Yuan to amend it. Lu concluded that the law is not a child's play, and legislation has its dignity, and the number of occupational representatives can no longer be increased. Sun Jiulu and others also spoke, expressing that the number cannot be increased again. The final resolution was that since there are problems with the procedure, the Legislative Yuan will not make any resolution on the matter of the number of occupational representatives among legislators, and will first hand over the case to the Constitutional Law Committee and the Legal System Committee for joint discussion, and then report to the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>The Legislative Election Districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong, and Other Provinces Are Determined</h3>
<p>In addition, at the meeting on the 29th, the issue of the division of legislative regions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces has also been decided. Jinshan in Jiangsu Province is included in the first district, Gaochun is included in the second district, Xianju in Zhejiang Province is moved to the third district, Wencheng is added to the third district, Ninghai is moved to the second district, and Fenhui, Tonglu, Jiande, and Chun'an are moved to the fourth district. In addition, the zoning issues in Hunan and Guangdong have also been resolved. As for the issue of overseas Chinese representatives, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission intends to increase the number from 19 to 25. On the issue of the number of representatives from Tibet, Zhao Weipei suggested increasing it from 10 to 12, and Liu Jiaju advocated increasing it from 10 to 20. The meeting did not discuss it and did not make any decision.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Councilors Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunzu, Jiang Yiping, and others, believing that the Legislative Yuan will convene a meeting on the 29th to decide on the number of legislative members of professional groups, visited President Sun at 5 pm on the 28th, hoping that the Legislative Yuan would temporarily postpone the discussion on this issue so that there would be sufficient time to consider the proposals of the People's Political Council. Wang and others then separately conveyed their wishes to Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, and Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization, and Ma Chaojun, Minister of Labor, unanimously supporting this principle and not making a rigid decision hastily.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The list of the number of legislators and the division of election districts in Jiangsu Province has been passed by the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 29th. The details are as follows: a total of 63 counties and cities, and the number of legislators to be produced is 3 women and 35 men.</p>

<h3>Listening to the Handling of Student Protests; The Legislative Yuan Will Hold a Temporary Meeting Today; Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, and Others Will Attend to Report</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The Legislative Yuan will hold a temporary meeting at 9 am on the 30th to hear reports from Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Lisheng, Dong XianGuang, and others on the handling of student protests, the closure of three newspapers, and the measures to deal with student movements in the future. This resolution was decided by the Legislative Yuan at the afternoon regular meeting on the 29th after two temporary motions were proposed by legislators Lu Fu, Fu Tongxian, and others. Lu Fu's motion suggested inviting President Zhang to the Legislative Yuan to answer questions related to the student protests, public security, and the closure of the three newspapers. Fu's temporary motion proposed inviting Minister Zhu to the Legislative Yuan to explain the handling of the student protests and the measures to deal with student movements in the future, so that the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan could make suggestions on the student protests issue. Some legislators believed that the above issues were not only related to education, but also related to internal affairs and news, and hoped that Minister Zhang and Director Dong could also come to the Legislative Yuan. It was decided to invite Zhang, Zhu, Zhang, and Dong to answer together. However, there were still half a months until the next meeting, and the time was too long. It would be best to hold a meeting before June 2nd. Finally, it was decided that the temporary meeting would be held on the morning of the 30th.</p>
<h3>The Issue of US Loans to China; Marshall Urges the Export-Import Bank to Implement Them Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] Sources here say that Secretary of State Marshall believes that it is almost impossible to obtain Congressional approval for economic assistance to China before next year. Therefore, he is currently urging the Export-Import Bank of the United States to lend some loans to China as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs of its recovery work.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the leader of the Chinese supply delegation returned to this place from Nanjing a few days ago, carrying China's plan to use Export-Import Bank loans. The bank now insists that it needs to study and approve its plan before it can withdraw some loans from the $500 million loan.</p>

<h3>Central University Administrative Council Issues a Letter Urging Students to Return to Class; Peking Students Establish a Committee to Resume Classes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Central University Administrative Council today passed a letter urging students to return to class, stating in brief: The student movement at Central University has had a glorious history. The two movements of "January 25th" and "February 22nd" last year, with their just and far-reaching goals, strict and reasonable organization, and disciplined actions, achieved great results with little sacrifice of time, and gained widespread sympathy and praise. This strike has lasted for more than half a month, occupying one-fifth of the teaching time of this semester, causing the school to fall into a state of stagnation and chaos. The school's construction and the students' studies have suffered great losses. It must be understood that to "rescue education," one must first rescue the school; to rescue the school, one must first love the school and value studies. The students have already suffered great losses in their studies during the War of Resistance and the post-war recovery period, and it is already too late to make up for them. How can they continue to sacrifice in this way? Striving for peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. To ensure its success, it is necessary to propose just, reasonable, and acceptable opinions and plans from a detached standpoint. If there is a need to express something, it can be reasonably proposed at any time. Why predetermine a demonstration parade on June 2nd so early, which coincides with the anniversary of the anti-civil war movement stipulated by Yan'an last year, and is very easy to make people in the society suspect that this movement is closely related to party strife? It must be understood that the school is sacred and must never be allowed to become a place for party strife. Moreover, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools that went on strike later have already resumed classes. Recently, the Political Consultative Council has responded to the students' opinions to the government. It is hoped that the students will return to class as soon as possible with the enthusiasm of loving the school and loving their studies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Peking, 29th] Students in Peking universities who oppose the strike have recently established a "Committee for Resuming Classes in Various Universities" and issued a declaration, exposing the faces of conspirators who sacrifice the studies of young people, saying: "We absolutely do not oppose this student movement launched to demand increased public funding, increased food allowances, and increased teachers' salaries, but we are saddened that our movement has changed its nature in the middle, and has been changed by the monetary power of 436.5 million yuan. Our pure youth have become tools used by others in political struggles." It also pointed out that the huge expenditure of funds for this student unrest is enough to offset the public funding of various universities in Peking for a month with surplus. In addition, students who cherish their studies in major middle schools in Peking also issued a joint declaration at the same time, making three appeals: (1) Oppose all parties using young students as tools for political struggle, (2) We need to study quietly and oppose strikes, (3) All troublemakers, get out of the student groups!</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] According to recent reports from various regions, the overall situation nationwide is generally good, except for a few areas where crop growth has been slightly affected by inadequate rainfall. Currently, wheat, broad beans, and peas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in the southeastern and southwestern provinces have mostly headed and formed pods. Harvesting has already begun in areas where planting was done earlier. Spring wheat has been planted in the northwestern and northern provinces, and some areas are already in the tillering stage.

In the double-cropping areas of Taiwan and Guangdong provinces, southeastern Guangxi Province, and southern Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, the first crop of rice was sown in March and transplanted in April. According to reports, rainfall in these areas has been quite even this year, promising a good harvest. In other major rice-producing areas, such as the provinces in the Yangtze River basin and the southwestern rice-growing regions, seedlings are usually sown and cultivated in nursery beds in April, and transplanting is completed around the end of April and early May. Since late April, most areas have received ample rain, saturating the rice fields, allowing timely transplanting.

<h3>We Demand Japan Compensate 1 Million Tons of Ships to Transport Reparations Materials Home</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Officials from the Reparations and Restitution Group of our delegation to Japan told a Central News Agency reporter that given China's current shipping tonnage, port facilities, and transportation equipment, it would take two to three years to transport the 480,000 tons of machinery and industrial equipment Japan owes China in reparations back home. The port facilities capable of unloading reparations materials are inadequate, and floating docks are urgently needed due to the lack of wharves in China. The first step in transporting the first batch of reparations from Japan is to prepare 70 cranes, ranging in capacity from 10 tons to 150 tons. To prevent mishandling or miscalculation of Allied materials, China must acquire transportation equipment and a large number of spare parts and repair materials. China lacks ships, so it is hoped that the work of reparations in the form of Japanese ships can be successful. However, the work here is still disappointing. Although the work has been underway for a year, only four ships have been returned, with two more to be returned soon. Due to this severe lack of ships, the Reparations and Restitution Group recently joined with the Merchant Ship Reparations Committee to propose that our government demand 1 million tons of Japanese ships, of which 500,000 tons should be selected from the existing Japanese fleet, and the other 500,000 tons should be delivered within four years as newly built ships.</p>

Gandhi also asked Ambassador Luo to convey his regards to Chairman Chiang and the Chinese people today.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Gandhi asked Luo Jialun to convey his respect for Chairman Chiang and his prayers for China. Gandhi hinted that if he could travel abroad, he would visit China. The half-hour meeting between Gandhi and Ambassador Luo this afternoon was very natural and without any formality. Their conversation also touched on the current situation in India, but both expressed themselves in highly philosophical and historical terms. Gandhi likened the unrest in the Indian public to the flow of the Ganges River, where the mud and sand on the surface will eventually settle, and the water will eventually become clear. Luo, as a scholar and diplomat, stated in the conversation that if the lessons of history are ignored, history will repeat itself. The Mahatma of India seemed to agree with Luo's view and said that because things are constantly changing, either rising or falling, history should not repeat itself.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Achievements of the British Labour Government</h3>
<p>The British Labour Party conference opened in Margate on the 26th. In the days that followed, the conference discussed current domestic and foreign policy of England. The opposition’s shouts outside the conference and the disputes at the conference might cause a political upheaval in England. However, the British people are a resolute and calm nation, who value reason over emotion. Even in moments of emotional intensity, they can remain calm. Though they have different positions, they are all the same in their care for the country and their understanding of the difficult times. Thus, the air of this Labour Party conference was very tense, and the strength of the opposition was also very great, but it did not cause a storm in British politics from beginning to end. This cannot but be said to be due to the success of the British Labour Government in its two years in power, and their nation’s democratic character is indeed worthy of admiration. In today's turbulent world after the war, the British Labour Party has achieved this in its two years in power, which is really worthy of the world's attention. The Labour Party's arduous struggle has finally overcome economic difficulties, which is especially worthy of the unanimous attention of our Chinese government and people. "Stones from other hills can be used to polish jade." The authorities of the Chinese Kuomintang should be more humble and learn from it!</p>
<p>The flames of the Second World War were like a symbol of the decline of the British Empire. Most people were worried about it. During the war, the British themselves were worried about the future of Britain after the war, no matter how the war ended. After the end of the war, Britain had to rely on the assistance and support of other countries because of the successive departures of India and its dominions and the scarcity of domestic materials. The tragedy of Britain's future led to an unprecedented defeat for the Conservative Party, which had made great contributions to the victory in the war, in the first general election in Britain after the war. The Labour Party leader, Attlee, took Churchill's place and replaced him. On August 28, 1945, everyone knew that Attlee felt both happy and afraid when he went to 10 Downing Street to work for the first time. He could give full play to his political wisdom as the leader of the Labour Party from now on, but he was afraid that the future of Britain would be full of thorns. How to safely overcome the many difficulties in front of him was a serious question. Therefore, the Labour Party has been in power for nearly two years, and there has not been a day without being in a precarious situation, and there has not been a day without working hard in fear and trepidation. As far as the international situation is concerned, creating world peace is not an easy task. It is even more difficult than the Allied forces winning the war. The fact that the United States and the Soviet Union have not been able to get along with each other after the war and the two forces that are almost incompatible have made Britain feel very uneasy. Although Britain regards peace as the keynote of its foreign policy, it is not easy for the diplomatic authorities to solve the distress of where to go and what to do in the cracks between the United States and the Soviet Union. As far as the domestic situation is concerned, its seriousness is no less than that during the war. There is a shortage of all the materials needed for people's daily life. The wartime rationing system is still in place for food and clothing. The Labour government often feels that it has no way out in order to cope with the domestic housing shortage, coal shortage, and food shortage. Sometimes they cannot help but be at a loss, but after hard struggles, they have finally overcome the difficulties safely one after another. When we recall the internal affairs and foreign affairs of Britain in the past two years, we cannot but express our admiration for the Labour government's hard work.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, the domestic and foreign policies implemented by the British Labour cabinet are not completely free from criticism. As far as foreign policy is concerned, almost all the measures taken by the Labour government to deal with India, Palestine, and Egypt have been opposed by the Conservative Party. Therefore, in the House of Commons, it is often criticized by opposition leaders such as Churchill and Eden. However, Foreign Secretary Bevin's position in previous international conferences often coincided with that of the United States, and invisibly created a situation in which Britain and the United States jointly dealt with the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is often criticized by the so-called "rebellious members" of the Labour Party, who accuse the Labour Party's foreign policy of being no different from that of the Conservative Party. Therefore, in the House of Commons, the Labour government is also often ridiculed by the leaders of the rebels, Zilliacus and Crossman. On the eve of the opening of the Labour Party Congress, they also distributed pamphlets everywhere, "Keep Left," demanding that the Labour Party adopt a pro-Soviet and anti-American foreign policy. The Labour Party also distributed a pamphlet called "Cards on the Table," which meant to accuse the Soviet Union of not being able to cooperate sincerely, to answer the questions of the "rebellious elements." The issue of this foreign policy will also be taken out for discussion at the Labour Party Congress, and a heated debate is likely to be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Secondly, with regard to the domestic economy, in the past two years, the Labour government has continued to promote the method of nationalizing all enterprises in accordance with the Labour Party's established program. It has been promoted from nationalizing coal to nationalizing transportation. As far as the Labour Party is concerned, this is a kind of Labour Party social and economic policy, and it can only be implemented to see its effectiveness. However, as far as the Conservative Party is concerned, this is regarded as the best material to oppose the Labour cabinet. Therefore, Churchill often takes the opportunity to attack the Labour Party with the Labour Party's nationalization policy. On the other hand, the British Labour government, constrained by the domestic material environment, although it wants to do its best to improve the economic life of the people, Prime Minister Attlee is ultimately unable to create a miracle and make the British people well-fed and clothed in one fell swoop. Because of this, the British people's food and clothing still maintain the wartime rationing system, which makes people who have high hopes for the Labour Party have to express disappointment; especially the radical elements within the Labour Party, who are not very satisfied with the Labour government's economic policy. A part of the Labour Party members have put forward six requirements in order to enable Britain to become economically self-reliant: (1) Draft a plan to uniformly control labor and restrict the employment of workers in secondary industries; (2) Increase the allocation of US dollars for the purchase of American machinery and equipment; (3) Increase the number of members of the Mixed Production Committee; (4) Implement a production subsidy system; (5) Revise the current income tax system; (6) Ban the import of luxury goods. It is expected that a heated debate will be triggered when this proposal is put forward for discussion. However, we know that the most important issues in the British economy are to increase production and increase export trade. However, under the current situation of material shortages in Britain, it is indeed not an easy task to increase production and increase export trade. "A clever woman cannot cook without rice," this issue remains to be discussed at length at the Labour Party Congress.</p>
<p>In short, although the British Labour government has not achieved brilliant achievements in its two years in power, it has been able to face reality, be down-to-earth, and work hard in this difficult environment. It has not only solved many problems for Britain, but also turned danger into safety everywhere, enabling Britain to overcome many difficulties. It is difficult and valuable. Prime Minister Attlee's contribution to the revival of Britain should not be underestimated by the world. The achievements of the British Labour government in its two years in power are enough to prove the success of the moderate economic revolution, which is most worthy of our government's attention. Looking at others and thinking about ourselves, we cannot help but feel a lot of emotions!</p>

<h3>Invented Internal Medicines for Scrofula and Epilepsy</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Central College of Chinese Medicine Donates Formula</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Scrofula and epilepsy are considered difficult to treat by both Chinese and Western medicine. Recently, medical circles in the country have devoted themselves to research and invented internal medicines, a natural method of dissipating scrofula, and a method of radically curing epilepsy. These methods have been clinically tested in major hospitals and proven effective. The Hong Kong Central College of Chinese Medicine has detailed these two methods and printed them into booklets, which will be distributed to compatriots at home and abroad.

<h3>Indian National Congress Informs British Government that Partition Plan is Difficult to Accept; Gandhi Accuses British of Disregarding Indian Minorities</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th] Viceroy Mountbatten and his wife returned to New Delhi by private plane at 7:15 this morning, carrying a plan for the transfer of power to India approved by the British Cabinet. Ismay, Chief of Staff to the Viceroy, and Watson, his private secretary, accompanied them on the same plane.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] According to sources from the Indian National Congress here, the Congress has informed the British government that it cannot accept the plan to divide India into Hindustan and Pakistan under any circumstances.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 28th] Gandhi said in a speech tonight that Britain must kill him, Gandhi, before it can divide India. If Britain is sincere, it must fulfill its promise and withdraw from India. After Britain withdraws, whether India can resolve the matter peacefully or through civil war is none of Britain's business. He also said that the Viceroy's practice of disregarding minorities such as Christians and Parsees whenever important discussions are held is inappropriate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 28th] Rumors are circulating in India that large-scale bloodshed and riots will occur throughout the country after the Viceroy presents the plan for the transfer of power to Indian leaders on June 2nd. Gandhi and Sikh leader Singh have both mentioned this matter separately. Gandhi urged the people not to worry or fear in a prayer meeting, saying, "If the Muslims say, 'If you don't give me Pakistan, I will use my sword,' we should answer, 'We will never give you Pakistan. You can cut me or the country into pieces.' If you have the courage to say this, then God will break the Muslims' swords." Sikh leader Singh said in a speech in Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, that unrest may occur in Punjab after June 2nd, but he hopes that the plan announced by the Viceroy can ensure that the Sikhs in the province receive fair treatment. Leaders of the Muslim League, Congress, Sikhs, and other factions in Punjab Province convened a roundtable conference in Lahore today to discuss the issue of restoring order in the province. Nehru is expected to arrive in Lahore tomorrow. At the same time, the General Headquarters announced that the Fourth Indian Division, a division that had fought alongside the British Eighth Army in North Africa and Italy, has been transferred from southern India to Punjab Province as a precaution. British Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck will rush back to India from London within days to take command.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Annual Conference Vote: Support for Bevin's Foreign Policy; Proposal to Cut Military Spending Rejected</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 29th (via broadcast): The British Labour Party's annual conference has almost unanimously voted in favor of Bevin's foreign policy. Among the 1,200 delegates, only a few dozen voted against it. Prior to the vote, Bevin delivered a 90-minute speech criticizing the left-wing members of the Labour Party in Parliament for launching "cold arrows" at him while he was engaged in important negotiations with the U.S. government.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 29th (via broadcast): At today's British Labour Party annual conference, Labour MPs such as Zilliacus, who oppose the "excessive" closeness of Britain and the United States and are pro-Soviet, vehemently criticized Bevin's pro-American foreign policy and proposed a motion to strengthen British-Soviet friendship, requesting the conference to pass it. When Bevin stepped onto the podium, he was warmly welcomed, and the majority of the delegates indicated that they would continue to support his foreign policy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Margate, 28th]: During the initial debate on Bevin's foreign policy at the Labour Party's annual conference today, left-wing members demanded a review of military obligations and the allocation and organization of the military, with the aim of significantly reducing the government's goals set for March 1, 1948. This comprehensive proposal was rejected by 237,000 votes to 109,000. In addition, the government also won victories on proposals for economic planning and electricity production to address the national economic crisis.</p>
<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Advocates Self-Reliance; Urges No More Dependence on Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>[United Press, Margate, 28th]: Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton stated in a speech at the Labour Party conference today that Britain must no longer rely on loans from the United States. He hoped that the conference would reject or withdraw the anti-government resolutions proposed on the issues of manpower and foreign policy. With the U.S. loan nearing exhaustion, we must no longer rely on foreign debt and must seek self-reliance. The future of Britain depends entirely on increasing exports to balance imports; otherwise, we will have to reduce imports. This is the most significant test currently facing Britain, and the success or failure of the nation's future hinges on it.</p>
<h3>Deepening Divisions Within the Labour Party; Executive Committee Indirectly Acknowledges It</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Margate, 28th]: Regarding the book "Cards on the Table," distributed by the Labour Party secretariat to the conference a few days ago, the Labour Party's executive committee has issued a statement to the conference about the book, which almost indirectly acknowledges the divisions within the Labour Party. It stated briefly that the book was published by the Labour Party but was not intended to explain the party's policy, only as a "contribution" to the discussion of foreign policy. Some observers believe that the Labour Party's executive committee's statement today has exposed its predicament. There are two major facts at today's Labour Party conference that are worth noting: a large number of Labour Party members supported by the miners' and engineers' associations demanded (1) the restoration of the "Direction of Labour" system and (2) the establishment of a consistent wage policy. However, the conference, following the demands of the opposition associations, rejected both of the above requirements.</p>
<h3>Change of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Bogomolov Succeeds</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th]: News received here today from Moscow states that the Soviet authorities issued an order on January 24th of this year, appointing the Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, as Deputy Foreign Minister. The Soviet authorities also issued an order on March 19th, removing Dekanozov from the post of Deputy Foreign Minister. The above two orders were published in the Soviet official gazette on May 7th, but the Soviet newspapers have not yet commented on them.</p>
<h3>Turkey's Firm Stance: Determined to Safeguard Territorial Integrity; Parliament Approves Extension of State of Emergency on Turkish Borders</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 29th]: Turkish Prime Minister Bayar told Parliament that a certain foreign country, under the pretext of joint defense measures, has sent a note to the Turkish government requesting to obtain bases in Turkey, and that Turkey is now facing demands that are almost equivalent to territorial demands. Although Turkey is in an atmosphere filled with danger, it must maintain a firm attitude. These territorial demands do not seem to be abandoned, so the Turkish government, after careful consideration, has decided that it cannot implement the demobilization of the army under the current circumstances. We must not ignore the significant burden on our nation's future. This year, Turkey has become the cornerstone of the Middle East, the Orient, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey still does not know when it will face the threat of internal forces, and although this is only a possibility, it cannot be said to be impossible. The Turkish Prime Minister then requested Parliament to approve the extension of the "state of emergency" declared in the European part of Turkey and the area near Greece and the islands since 1940, and Parliament approved the extension.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th]: Ankara Radio reported that Turkish Prime Minister Bayar told an American reporter that Turkey is willing to maintain friendship with the Soviet Union but will never accept friendship under "Munich conditions." Fortunately, there are currently no Chamberlains or Daladiers in power to force Turkey to accept "Munich-style" conditions to appease the Soviet Union. Turkey is very willing to adopt a good-neighborly policy towards the Soviet Union. In order to restore friendship between the two countries, the Soviet Union must abandon its intention to infringe upon Turkey's territorial integrity. Turkey will never agree to or even discuss the transfer of land or allow foreign countries to use Turkish bases.</p>
<h3>The Four Powers Will Meet in London to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories in Africa; Inevitably Involving Important Interests of Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th]: The Four Powers will soon meet in London to discuss the future of the Italian colonies. The main difficulty is that establishing a trusteeship over any of these Italian African colonies will involve significant strategic interests. The extent of this importance can only be measured after the following four issues are resolved: (1) Egypt's appeal to the Security Council to have British troops withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone and Sudan; (2) The United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue, which will ultimately determine whether Britain will end its mandate and withdraw its troops stationed in the Holy Land; (3) The attempt to revise the 1926 Montreux Convention, and whether the Soviet Union can obtain a military base in the Dardanelles Strait, which can only be determined after the Strait Convention is revised; (4) Italy's current domestic political crisis, the outcome of which may determine the degree to which the powers are willing to consider Italy's request for a trusteeship over part of its colonies. Until the former issues are resolved, Britain cannot formulate a final defense plan for the Near East, which may involve the development of bases in East Africa to determine Abyssinia's claims to Eritrea. Before the issues of Palestine and Egypt are resolved, it is difficult for the powers to determine the demands made by Arab countries representing the Arab residents of North Africa. Before the issue of the Black Sea Straits is resolved, the Soviet Union cannot quickly decide whether to abandon its demand for a sole trusteeship over Libya. The Soviet Union raised this demand at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in September 1945, but Britain firmly opposed it, arguing that a sole Soviet trusteeship over Libya would be the most serious threat to the Suez Canal. Since the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, the international situation has become more complicated, and it is difficult to predict whether the United States will therefore oppose the Soviet Union's sole trusteeship. To speak of joint trusteeship, it will likely be difficult at the beginning of implementation. The prolonged indecision on the Korean issue makes this clear.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Committee Negotiations Still Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 29th (via broadcast): Soviet and American military representatives to Korea, Shtikov and Brown, resumed negotiations today on the issue of the Korean political system. The results were not announced, and both sides are scheduled to issue a communique on Saturday.</p>
<p>Another report: Today's negotiations did not achieve any success.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 29th]: U.S. Chief Representative to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, General Brown, requested Soviet Chief Representative General Shtikov on the morning of the 29th to immediately reopen the commission to discuss selecting representatives from Korean political parties and individuals to invite to the meeting for consultation purposes. The subcommittee designated to discuss the selection of representatives from Korean political parties and individuals failed to reach an agreement. The U.S. representatives reported this deadlock to Brown on the evening of the 29th.</p>
<h3>Authorities in British and American Occupation Zones Announce Establishment of Economic Committee in Germany; Invite Soviet and French Participation in Economic Merger Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 29th (via broadcast): British Deputy Military Governor of Germany Robertson and U.S. Commander-in-Chief Clay jointly announced today the establishment of the "All-German Economic Committee" to plan the construction of the two occupation zones. With the establishment of this committee, the Germans themselves have gained the greatest economic power since the end of the war. However, in today's communique, both the British and American sides solemnly declared that the committee must obtain the consent of both the British and American sides before taking action.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Berlin, 29th]: The German Economic Committee will consist of 54 members, who will be elected by the state parliaments of Germany. Clay and Robertson jointly notified that the Soviet and French governments were again invited to participate in the economic merger between the U.S. and British zones, which has been implemented since January 1st.</p>
<h3>Marshall Urges Senate Approval of St. Lawrence River Development Treaty; Aims to Strengthen US-Canada Joint Defense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th]: Secretary of State Marshall, former President Hoover, and others provided opinions to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is currently reviewing the $500 million international development plan. When referring to the treaty concluded between the United States and Canada to develop the St. Lawrence River, Secretary of State Marshall strongly urged the Senate to approve the treaty immediately, as the development plan would greatly help the United States and Canada jointly defend the North American continent. After the completion of the St. Lawrence River project, it would allow giant ocean-going ships to be built in relatively safe inland rivers, open a new and important transportation line to the industrial heartland of the United States, and its hydropower generation would be comparable to the power generation of the Tennessee River Valley and the Columbia Colorado River Valley. These developments are all prerequisites for the development of atomic energy. Hoover's words concerned the world food problem. He said: If maritime transportation is smooth, all of the United States' surplus grain can be transported abroad to relieve disaster victims. Currently, at most, only 1.5 million tons of grain can be supplied to the other side of the Atlantic every day.</p>
<h3>Britain Expresses Great Approval for Military Cooperation in the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 28th (United Press)]: Senior government officials today stated that Britain expressed great approval for Truman's statement on military cooperation in the Western Hemisphere. Regarding the suggestion that Truman made to Canada, the official stated that Britain, at last year's Commonwealth Conference in London, had decided to negotiate with the territories on participating in regional defense agreements such as the one proposed by Truman. Canada's participation in this defense agreement would strengthen military ties between Britain and the United States and would allow the armies of the Americas to coordinate with Britain and the countries of the Western European Hemisphere.</p>
<h3>Three-Party Cabinet in Japan Gradually Taking Shape; Socialist Party Compromises; Democratic Party's Four Conditions Fully Accepted</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th]: The political situation has entered the stage of a three-party coalition cabinet. The Socialist Party, keenly aware of the need to bring the Democratic Party into the cabinet, is making every effort to compromise in future negotiations with the Democratic Party. It will state in its declaration that the Socialist Party has severed ties with the Communist Party. Regarding the ratio of cabinet posts, it plans to be six, six, two. Regarding concrete policies, it will respect the Democratic Party's proposals as much as possible. If the Democratic Party still does not join the cabinet, it plans to form a two-party cabinet with the People's Cooperative Party. At this time, cabinet members will not be limited to within the party, but will broadly seek talent from all quarters to counter the attacks of the opposition conservative parties.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th]: According to well-informed sources, at the Democratic Party's executive meeting held on the 29th, the general trend is moving towards a three-party coalition cabinet.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th]: Prime Minister Katayama summoned Democratic Party leaders Ashida and Shidehara at noon on the 29th at the Prime Minister's official residence and requested their final cooperation on the cabinet formation issue. In response, the Democratic Party convened a special meeting in the afternoon and decided to accept the Socialist Party's request, but with the following conditions: (1) Cabinet meeting secrets must never be divulged; (2) Actions that cause social unrest must not be taken; (3) Absolutely no extreme right-wing or extreme left-wing actions must be taken; (4) If any of the above conditions are violated, each party shall take responsible measures. The above four conditions were notified to the Socialist Party by Matsumoto representing the Democratic Party. After receiving the conditions proposed by the Democratic People's Party, the Socialist Party convened a central executive committee at 5:00 PM and resolved to fully accept the four conditions, and immediately sent personnel to the Liberal Party, Democratic Party, and People's Cooperative Party to notify them of the contents of the agreement between the Socialist and Democratic parties.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th]: After receiving the notification from the Socialist Party that it had acknowledged the conditions proposed by the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party convened an executive meeting starting at 7:00 PM to discuss the attitude it should adopt towards the Katayama cabinet in the future. Centered on Ashida, Shidehara, and Saito, three factions with left-wing, right-wing, and centrist opinions formed, and no conclusion was reached. Finally, it was decided to postpone the discussion to the 30th, and the meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Ashida Hitoshi Will Be Purged</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th]: According to the most reliable sources, Democratic Party President Ashida Hitoshi will be purged from the party, and it is rumored that the purge order will be issued after the current cabinet is formed.</p>

<h3>Special Committee for Guidance on Student Unrest Resolves to: Comfort Students, Investigate the Truth; Those Arrested for Overstepping Boundaries to Be Treated Leniently by Authorities; All Actions to Proceed After Reporting to the Assembly</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Special Committee for Guidance on Student Unrest of the Municipal Council held a meeting at the council at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss guidance methods, chaired by Wang Zhengting. More than a dozen councilors present spoke one after another. As a result, four points of action were passed, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM today to finalize the "Letter to Students," etc., and to proceed after reporting to the Assembly.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting first stated: This time, the majority of students were incited by a small number of unscrupulous elements, resulting in student unrest. Fortunately, it is now gradually subsiding. He hopes that students can resume classes in good faith. He was also entrusted by Lu Ganchen, the General Secretary of the Youth Association, to appeal on his behalf that some students have been arrested recently, and he hopes that the government authorities can turn big issues into small issues and small issues into no issues. Tao Baichuan stated that the current task is to ensure that the beaten students receive comfort and protection, and then to provide guidance; otherwise, if strong measures continue to be adopted, the situation will deteriorate further. He hopes that the government authorities will avoid stimulation and that even arrested students should be given less stimulation. Ye Fenghu advocated starting from the root cause, finding ways for the pure and good students' proposals to be realized, and guiding them in the direction they should go, so that student unrest can be avoided in the future. He suggested that councilors, in their personal capacity, investigate the truth in the schools concerned. Wang Weiyin proposed stopgap measures, such as organizing visiting groups to investigate various schools separately. Fundamental methods, such as having the schools elect legal student union representatives, and having the council directly discuss matters with the representatives, etc. Pang Jingzhou said that organizing visiting groups seemed too rushed in terms of time. Could emergency methods be adopted, such as inviting the heads of various schools to have a symposium with the council? Zai Zhuyi stated that the content and factors of the incidents in various schools are different, so solutions should be sought by addressing individual problems. The government authorities should reduce stimulation, and news published in newspapers should not be too激動. He suggested starting today to exchange opinions with the principals of various schools separately. Zhao Yangxiong stated: (1) Among the arrested students, there are those who advocate strikes and those who advocate resuming classes. Should the council express a fair attitude regarding whether it advocates their release? (2) Should the injured students be comforted? (3) Some school principals and other responsible persons are resigning. Should they be retained? (4) Should student parents be consulted to persuade and restrain their children? Zhao Junhao suggested that the council appoint representatives to comfort the injured students. Huang Shijin hopes that the authorities will understand the psychology of young people and must not add fuel to the fire by arresting students. He agreed with the opinion of the Yenching University professor that teachers who are respected by the students should provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Four Points of Action Decided</h3>
<p>As a result of the discussion, four points of action were tentatively decided: (1) Members of the committee who are alumni of the universities concerned will go to the respective schools to comfort the students injured in the incident, regardless of the cause or faction of the injuries. (2) The councilor alumni will go to the respective schools in their personal capacity to investigate the truth. (3) Attitude towards arrested students: (1) Those who have been arrested and found not to have violated the law will be requested to be released by the military camp authorities. (2) Those who have been arrested for violating discipline will also be requested to be treated leniently by the authorities, warned, and released. (3) Those who have been arrested for being deemed to have overstepped boundaries will be requested by the military and police authorities to be handed over to the school principal or professors and parents to be taken back for supervision. (4) Tao Baichuan, Zhao Junhao, and Huang Shijin, three councilors, were appointed to draft a letter to students based on the opinions obtained from today's (29th) discussion, to be submitted for decision at the meeting on the 30th.</p>

<p>The review committee resolved yesterday: (1) The aerial surveying fees and temporary fees for cleaning up accumulated garbage in the first additional budget should be incorporated into the original budget of the respective units for unified management and distribution, and no additional amount should be added separately.

<h3>Improving the Issuance of Subsidies for New School Staff and Employees</h3>
<p>Education Issues: (1) Resolved (1) All school buildings and land occupied by various agencies under the municipal government should be vacated by the municipal government by the end of July this year. (2) For those occupying school buildings and land of central government agencies, the city will電報 the central government to strictly order them to relocate.

(4) Requested the police bureau to revoke the "Prohibition of old goods stalls and pawnshops from selling goods purchased within ten days, and the purchase price may not be paid to the seller within ten days."</p>
<h3>Discussing Housing Allocation and Lease Terms Together</h3>
<p>Land Administration Issues: Regarding the "Request to the authorities to return all land and buildings of the Central Market to restore private property rights," the review result was approved in principle. The method is to send a letter to the municipal government to investigate and return the property to the owners. If requisition is necessary, it should be handled according to legal procedures. Regarding the extension of leases for military, government, and education personnel allocated housing, the proposer, Zhang Zhihan, requested the council to reaffirm the resolution of the second meeting of the first session, ordering landlords to extend the lease term and renew leases with the allocated personnel. Ma Shaoquan (chairman of the Real Estate Association) stated that the reason why general landlords refuse to sign leases is still because the rent has not been legally adjusted. If the Municipal Council can handle this according to Article 90 of the Land Law, allowing landlords to legally increase rent, then this dispute can be resolved. Finally, Chairman Lu Shidao proposed a vote, and the case was transferred to the relevant motion regarding rent review for joint discussion in order to seek a thorough solution.</p>

<h3>China Aluminum Factory Resists Resumption of Production; Social Affairs Bureau to Suggest Government Takeover</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Swiss Consul General visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday regarding the suspension dispute of the Swiss-owned China Aluminum Steel Refinement Factory. Director Wu stated that the factory's abrupt suspension was inappropriate. The Social Affairs Bureau can agree to the factory's proposal to dismiss one or two workers who caused the incident, but it is unreasonable to subsequently dismiss more than one hundred workers without cause. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the factory to resume production twice, but it has not complied. If the factory has any objections, it can apply for arbitration from the municipal government. Continuing to close the factory and disregard the workers is illegal. If workers go on strike without cause, wages may not be paid according to regulations. However, since the factory suddenly suspended operations without cause, workers' wages will be requested to be paid as usual.</p>
<p>Director Wu later told reporters that if either labor or management is dissatisfied with the mediation, they can apply for arbitration. If they neither comply with the mediation record nor apply for arbitration within the deadline, then one party can sue in court. The Social Affairs Bureau will also take appropriate action against labor or management who violate the law. Director Wu stated that if measures such as dissolution are taken, it would only cause panic among workers about job loss. Therefore, he will suggest to the central government that in such cases, the government should take over the factory, similar to the practice in the United States.</p>
<h3>Settlement Reached in British Tram Workers Mediation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The British Tram Company employees' request for improved treatment has been under negotiation for a long time and has not been resolved. Yesterday afternoon, Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened negotiations between labor and management and reached a conclusion, which will be notified to both parties today.</p>
<h3>City to Strengthen Alert Today on May 30th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Today is the 22nd anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. The garrison authorities held a special meeting yesterday afternoon and decided to strengthen alert in the city, dividing it into six districts: Southeast, Northwest, Central, and Water.</p>
<h3>Price Hike of Public Utilities to Be Finally Decided at National Price Conference; Director Zhao Says Adjustment Necessary</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The issue of raising the prices of public utilities in the city has not yet been specifically decided. According to Mayor Wu after returning to Shanghai, whether or not to raise prices depends on the final decision of the National Price Conference to be held in Beijing tomorrow. Due to official duties in the city, Mayor Wu decided to send Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to Beijing to attend the meeting, so that proper decisions can be made regarding rice prices and public utilities in the city.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, reporters visited Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to inquire about the plans he would bring to Beijing to solve the losses of public utilities in the city. According to Director Zhao, after the cost of living index was unfrozen, the losses of public utilities agencies will inevitably increase month by month, and the central government will not be able to bear the burden. If they reluctantly increase subsidies for the time being, there will inevitably be a day when they cannot afford it. If the prices of public utilities have to be adjusted, the multiple of the increase will be considerable, and its impact on citizens will also be significant. Therefore, Mayor Wu and Director Zhao both believe that the city's public utilities, compared with current prices, definitely need to be adjusted. According to Director Zhao, public utilities may be allowed to automatically adjust prices in the future, but they must be based on three factors: fuel (coal and gasoline), cost of living index, and foreign exchange. Public utilities agencies must submit the minimum cost when adjusting prices to the Public Utilities Bureau and forward it to the municipal government for approval. According to reporters' inquiries from relevant parties, although the multiples of the price adjustments that the city's public utilities agencies are currently requesting from the municipal government are not consistent, the average is at least around four or five times.</p>
<h3>Underground Bank Busted; Disguised as a Dentist's Clinic</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway General Union had previously proposed to the authorities to improve the treatment of workers and suggested adjusting passenger fares. The Ministry of Communications approved the case, and the passenger and freight fares of the two railways will remain at the original price. The road workers' treatment will be in accordance with the civil servant salary method from May, with a base of 340,000 per month, a base salary calculated at 1,800 times, plus 30% of the total, a rice subsidy of 30,000 yuan, and a housing subsidy of 25,000 yuan, which will still be issued as before.

The talents are average. Yesterday, the leader Wang Zongmou came to supervise the battle in person, and the morale was greatly boosted. The Central Bank is also a strong team in the silver and money industry, but because of its short stature and lack of confidence in shooting, it cannot cope and is in a following situation.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, Wang Wanchun, the captain of the Shanghai Bank, completed it in one breath, occupying an absolute advantage of nine to zero. Zhou Fukun then left the venue due to a foot injury, which was slightly relaxed, but the Shanghai Bank still controlled the situation. The first half was eighteen to five, and the Shanghai Bank won.

<h3>Acquisition of Spring Cocoon Factory Loans; More Than 120 Billion Yuan Have Been Allocated; 69 Have Signed Contracts with the Agricultural Bank</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] According to the Chinese Farmers Bank, as of now, 69 manufacturers have signed contracts with the bank to acquire merchant loans, and the total number of purchases has reached 54,572 dan. Calculated at 3.5 million yuan per dan of fresh silkworm, plus 15 billion yuan of reserve funds for Yigan Silk Fengxun of various factories collected on behalf of the China Silk Corporation, the total amount of loans amounts to 206 billion yuan. The manufacturers signed contracts with China Morning Bank in a total of seven batches. The details of each time are as follows:</p>
<p>(Batch) (Number of Factories) (Purchase Amount)</p>
<p>Batch 1 29 36,761 dan</p>

<p>Batch 3 3 1,344 dan</p>

<p>Batch 6 3 1,427 dan</p>

<p>When the amount of cocoon collection by each manufacturer in Jiangsu and Zhejiang exceeds the approved quota, the excess amount will be purchased by the China Silk Corporation on its behalf. The purchase funds are allocated from another 15 billion yuan of the 200 billion yuan loan amount for use. Furthermore, the China Silk Corporation's cocoon collection funds of 2 billion yuan in the Anhui region are now feeling insufficient, and 500 million yuan has also been allocated from the 15 billion yuan of funds for use.</p>

(3) The main principle of the government's support for bulk export materials is to support the production and sales of export materials. In recent years, domestic and foreign market prices have failed to coordinate, and merchants will suffer losses when exporting, so they have requested the government to purchase and export them to compensate. After the government purchases them, the profits and losses shall be borne by the national treasury. However, the purchase has no controlling nature. Merchants can still do as they please if they can transport it themselves.</p>
<h3>People's Food Allocation Committee: Formation Possible Within the Next Week; Rice Market Firm Then Weak, Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Municipal People's Food Allocation Committee is expected to be officially established within the next week. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and concurrent Chairman of the Committee, stated yesterday that after the draft of the committee's organization was prepared, it was originally scheduled to be submitted to the municipal meeting on the 30th for discussion. However, since the municipal meeting has been temporarily suspended, it has been submitted to Mayor Wu for review. It will be established first upon Mayor Wu's approval and then submitted to the municipal council for discussion. After the establishment of the committee, the existing Food Section under the Social Affairs Bureau will not be abolished. The allocation of rice to schools and factories will be transferred to the Allocation Committee for handling. The distribution of rice to the poor will not be implemented this month. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to invite district chiefs and representatives of district residents on June 2nd to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. Letters have also been sent to various districts to inquire whether they are capable of handling the distribution of rice to the poor, in order to determine whether the municipal government or autonomous organizations should be responsible for it.</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The rice market yesterday was initially firm but then weakened. After the opening, various trading groups had slightly better sales. Later, due to the limited arrival of japonica rice, there were inquiries, and the morning weather was cloudy with a hint of rain, leading to a strengthening of sentiment. Consequently, the japonica rice market rebounded by several thousand yuan. As for indica rice, due to the considerable release of holdings by holders, and the limited capacity of shops, the market was stable and maintained its original price. However, before the market closed, due to tight credit conditions and lack of purchasing power, the prices of both japonica and indica rice declined, with both northern and southern markets trending downwards. Yesterday, the registered arrivals at the market totaled 4,768 shih and 4 dou. High-quality white japonica was priced at 410,000 yuan, and thin paddy ranged from 400,000 yuan to 405,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sufficient Supply of Rice, Wheat, and Cooking Oil</p>
<p>Mayor Wu recently returned to Shanghai on the 28th after being summoned to Beijing. It is understood that in addition to reporting on the student unrest in Shanghai, important instructions were received regarding the issue of commodity prices. In the future, concerning rice: (1) efforts will be made to ensure smooth transportation from the production areas to Shanghai; (2) the amount of rice allocated for sale will be increased from 180,000 shih to 300,000 shih starting next month. As for cooking oil: (1) the city will continue to purchase soybeans from the Northeast region to meet factory needs; (2) other organizations will be requested to purchase soybeans and other miscellaneous grains at reasonable market prices to avoid stimulating price increases in the production areas. Regarding wheat flour, due to a lack of rain in the production areas during the wheat season, this year's harvest may not be ideal. The city has already considered remedial measures for the future source of raw materials for wheat flour.</p>
<p>The price of wheat flour fluctuated up and down yesterday, and with the impending implementation of flour rationing, demand weakened, causing prices to fall back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Bran trading was sluggish, and the situation was stable. Soybean cake initially rose and then stabilized, with prices increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The situation for soybeans became fixed.</p>
<p>The cooking oil market saw continuous arrivals from Qingdao, leading to a gradual decline in prices. Crude oil, soybean oil, refined oil, and rapeseed oil all saw a price drop of 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil was stable and weak. Mung beans continued to decline, falling to a further low of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were traded actively but not vigorously, with high prices being stable and secondary prices being weak. Raw peanuts stabilized after falling. There were few transactions for red sorghum, so it experienced little gain or loss for the time being. Corn digestion was also weak, without much fluctuation. Red beans stood firm.</p>
<p>Reviewing Standards for Rice Rationing Regulations</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs and Education Bureaus have been reviewing the rice rationing work for factories and schools with great intensity in recent days. More than 200 public and private schools have been approved, and payment notices have been issued successively. As for factories, there are quite a few that do not meet the regulations. For the sake of speed, eligibility is limited to those holding a factory registration certificate with the character "Gong" issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a temporary receipt for the industrial registration application with the character "Guan Gong" issued by the Social Affairs Bureau. All others holding company licenses with the characters "She" or "Xin," business registration certificates with the character "Shang," and temporary receipts for business registration applications with the character "Guan Shang" will not be reviewed and will be immediately rejected for rice rationing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some labor unions in the city have recently notified factories not to include workers who are not members of the union in the rice rationing scheme and have requested instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau clarified yesterday: (1) Applications for rice rationing should be made by the factory as a unit, and all employees, including child laborers, can be included for rice certification. There is no provision that workers who are not members of the union are not entitled to rice rationing. (2) All factory employees must hold a national identity card. If they are still in the process of applying for one, they should submit a list of numbers when they receive them during the first rice collection. If they are unable to receive the identity card before the first rice collection, flexibility will be allowed. All approved rice rationing will be issued as usual, but an identity card is required for the second application.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Jianxin steamship, represented by the Hualun Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Bangkok, carrying 41,220 bags of rice. The unloading is currently underway. This Siamese rice was purchased by the China Trust Bureau. The Jianxin steamship was newly imported from the United States by the Yixiang Shipping Company and went to Siam to transport rice. Therefore, this is the ship's first arrival in Shanghai.</p>

Ewo Yarns opened at 68,000 yuan and ranged from a high of 69,500 yuan to a low of around 67,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the industry-wide general industry rose by half a percent, British-United remained flat, and other stocks all showed slight increases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sentiment Improves</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw improved sentiment and a renewed upward trend due to the Taiwan Sugar Company's allocation being halved and only two varieties being available, leading to a perception of no shortage. The Sugar Association, Peruvian sugar rose to over 440,000 yuan, an increase of over 20,000 yuan. Semi-refined heavy white sugar was 445,000 yuan, reaching 450,000 yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan.

<h3>Cigarette Sales Up, Prices Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market lacked energy because it was the end of the month, and firms were scrambling for funds. Selling was common in the market, and general hoarders, seeing the imminent approach of telegrams, were also offering more for sale. Furthermore, foreign group firms were also releasing their holdings, creating a situation of oversupply, and the market price frequently declined.</p>
<p>Great Britain brand cigarettes initially hovered around 6.67 million yuan, gradually decreasing to around 580,000 yuan. In the afternoon, there were some sporadic purchases, showing a slight rebound, and finally closed at 6.73 million yuan, an increase of 90,000 yuan. Old Knife cigarettes were 5.85 million yuan, also up 50,000 yuan. There was particularly heavy selling of 20-pack Great Britain cigarettes, with the price decreasing from 22,000 yuan to 7,500 yuan, eventually rebounding to 28,200 yuan, a decrease of 600 yuan per carton. Other Chinese and American brand cigarettes also saw prices fall more than rise due to the approaching telegram season and the reluctance of buyers to come forward.</p>
<h3>Outport Sales Agents Have Buying Intentions; Rayon Prices Called Firm; Spun Silk Is a Rare Commodity, Seeing Another Frenzied Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market saw a surge in prices as soon as it opened due to slight buying interest from outport sales agents. No. 120 Gaoshan bright rayon was first called at 18.1 million yuan, which was immediately traded, then rose in a straight line, with the highest bid exceeding 19 million yuan. However, due to buyers remaining on the sidelines, the price fell back, closing at 18.6 million yuan. There was not much trading in the afternoon. The final asking price was 18.7 million yuan, an increase of 1.2 million yuan from the previous day. Xintianqiao and Dongyang brands were called at 18.8 million yuan. No. 75 semi-bright rayon also saw an increase of 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spun silk market experienced another frenzied increase due to rumors that the price of improved silkworm cocoons in Zhejiang had increased to 1.4 million yuan, calculating the cost per dan to be 25 million yuan. Furthermore, market inventory was extremely low, and general holders considered it a rare commodity, unanimously driving up prices. In the morning, B-grade was bid at 25 million yuan, but a counteroffer of 4 million yuan did not result in a transaction. D-grade was bid at 24 million yuan, with the official transaction price at 23 million yuan. In the afternoon, a counteroffer of 4 million yuan still did not result in a sale. The bidding prices for other grades were all approximately 2 million yuan higher than the previous day, and the market situation was extremely chaotic, with very little trading. There was a five-dan lot with an inspection certificate, with a bid of 18 million yuan. Another lot was called at around 16 million yuan, but there were no official transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market rose along with the raw materials. Meiya quilt cover spot prices were quoted by the factory at 19 million yuan. In the market, the sub-goods were bid at 18.8 million yuan. Dachen checkered crepe initially traded at 31,200 yuan, then traded at 31,500 yuan in the middle of the day. Finally, the bid was 31,600 to 31,700 yuan. In the afternoon, the silk price was high, and the sentiment was even stronger, with sellers bidding 32,000 yuan. Huajin crepe officially traded at 14,000 yuan. The price of Shenghuo goods also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Luofang was reported to be rising in Hangzhou, with Luojing priced at 11,000 yuan and Fang priced at 11,600 yuan, so the Shanghai market also rose sharply by 500 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Market Rumors Abound, Chinese Stocks Trend Weak</h3>
<p>Although the drop-period arbitrage on Chinese stocks was cheap yesterday, various unfavorable news for delivery continued to emerge, making it difficult to sustain the firm trend to the end. International rumors and public security rumors resurfaced, revealing instability near the close.</p>
<p>The morning opening saw increases, with Nos. 142, 97, 117, 68, 76, 65, 215, and 61 all advancing. Nos. 134 and 99 advanced for spot Wing On Yarns, which rose from 7,250 yuan to 7,400 yuan. Nos. 89 and 122 were strongly sold and slightly rebounded. China Textile alone reported a limit up. At this time, the drop-period premium was small, making it quite stable. However, after 10:10 AM, Nos. 71, 179, 12, 112, and 171 Wing On Yarns were sold to 7,250 yuan, and Nos. 122, 125, 94, 99, and 106 still advanced to 7,400 yuan. Nos. 226, 171, 193, 199, 155, 154, 160, and 232 came to sell, and many rumors unfavorable to delivery emerged, leading to a decline.</p>
<p>Nos. 231, 235, and 84 were resold to around 7,050 yuan. Nos. 224, 129, 77, 186, and 12 were cut at the close, forcing the drop-period Wing On Yarns down to 6,920 yuan. Nos. 142 and 157 advanced slightly, struggling to close at around 6,950 yuan. The after-market was peaceful. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Xinguang, Xinhua, and Wing On Public were flat. Wing On Yarn, Sino-French, and Wah Fung Ching Fook declined slightly. China Textile, a miscellaneous stock, had a limit up and then rebounded, increasing by slightly over 10%. Underwear fell by slightly less than 10%, domestic goods by slightly less than half a percent, matches and commercial flat, Rong Feng, Tong Yi, Li An, and Cement rose slightly, and the rest declined slightly. Among the stocks for delivery, Xinguang alone increased by half a percent, Wing On Yarn increased by slightly less than half a percent, Sino-French and Qunxing increased slightly, and Wing On Public and Ching Fook declined slightly. The increases and decreases of the old stocks outside the market were all slight.</p>
<p>The spot-drop period trading yesterday saw fewer longs, leading to crowded floating positions. Financial firms also frequently engaged in arbitrage, and the interest rate decreased from 2.5 jiao to 1.5 jiao, finally around 1.7 to 1.8 fen. The Wing On Yarn premium decreased from 450 yuan to below 320 yuan, finally around 330 to 350 yuan, due to the successive advances of Nos. 165, 45, 201, 97, 106, 137, 147, 185, 220, 231, 215, and 49. Small-cap stocks also decreased from 11 or 12 yuan to within 9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Firms Frequently Show Buying Interest; Yarn Prices Up From Previous Day; Various Grades of Cotton Cloth Also Showed Improvement of Several Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market initially opened flat, but then Tianjin and Guangdong firms, which had been quiet for a long time, showed signs of activity, and their buying intentions strengthened. Manufacturers in various locations along the Beijing-Hangzhou railway were actively buying, leading to rising asking prices. The opening price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 12.2 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count special double horse yarn was 7.55 million yuan, double horse yarn was 7.05 million yuan, and 16-count Guangming silk was 5.65 million yuan, all up from 140,000 to 250,000 yuan. The prices of other counts of yarn also increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw scattered holders selling due to the approaching end of the period and tight credit conditions. Longtou fine cloth once fell to 295,000 or 296,000 yuan. Later, hearing that yarn prices had rebounded, local dyeing factories and customers from Tianjin and Hankou seized the opportunity to buy on the dips. Until the end, the price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rebounded to 300,700 yuan, an increase of 9,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortune Blue Chicken, color ball and other fine cloths also increased by about 5,000 to 7,000 yuan. The prices of other materials such as serge, Zhigong silk, bleached cloth, raw cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth all rose by approximately 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Review Committee Decides to Expand Scope of Work</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] It is reported that the Foreign Exchange Review Committee, established by the Executive Yuan, aims to standardize foreign exchange reviews. The original scope of work was to review the foreign exchange required by various government agencies. It has now been decided to expand to include the review of general foreign exchange. Therefore, the committee's structure will include three sub-committees, each responsible for reviewing: (1) foreign exchange for agencies, (2) foreign exchange for imports, and (3) foreign exchange required by individuals. It is reported that the review procedures are awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. Once approved, they will be implemented.</p>
<p>The committee members include: Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Gan Naiguang, Chief Accountant of the National Government Xu Kan, Minister of Audit Lin Yunhai, and Governor of the Central Bank Zhang Jiazhi, with the Minister of Finance serving as the chairman of the committee.</p>
<h3>Caustic Soda Market Price Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for raw materials for soap and candles was stable due to the balance between supply and demand. However, there was a glut of spot goods for Yuet Pi brand caustic soda, with prices called at 7.1 million yuan per barrel, a decrease of 150,000 yuan from the previous day. American caustic soda also showed a weak trend, priced at 6.95 million yuan, also down slightly by 50,000 yuan from yesterday. The markets for other materials such as soda ash, coconut oil, and white wax were stable.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Lack Vitality</h3>
<p>Yesterday, among the daily necessities, Wong Cheung Mau soap fell from around 260,000 yuan to 255,000 yuan before someone was willing to buy. However, there were very few transactions. Then, those who had previously sold short came to replenish their positions, leading to a situation where the price initially dropped and then immediately rose. Finally, the price was 262,000 yuan, only slightly better by 1,000 yuan. Gu Ben and Jian Dao fell by 9,000 to 5,000 yuan. The markets for other Guanghua, Sunlight, Sun-Moon and other brands of soap and matches were all sluggish due to tight credit conditions at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Jiaozuo Lump Coal Price Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Since the price of bituminous coal was bid high, actual sales have been slow. However, there has also not been much supply, so the market situation has been hovering, slightly weak. The Jiaozuo lump white coal that arrived was handled by outsiders, making it difficult to sell immediately, so the market price was praised to fall. Due to the news of increased freight rates next month, which greatly affected costs, the coal briquette factories have been absorbing a lot of Yuanhua white coal dust recently.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Rebounds</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tuber previously declined due to slow sales, with ordinary goods only at 260,000 or 270,000 yuan. Recently, with summer sales picking up, it has become tight, with high-quality goods reaching 400,000 yuan and ordinary goods at 310,000 or 320,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Bank Dispatches Personnel to Hong Kong to Discuss Preventing Smuggling; Large Number of Smuggled Imports, Exports, and Remittances</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Recently, due to the increasingly serious problem of smuggling to and from Hong Kong, the government, in order to discuss how to prevent or reduce the severity of smuggling, has specially dispatched Shao Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, British legal advisor Rogers, and Shen Xihong, Executive Committee member of the Export Promotion Committee, to Hong Kong to jointly discuss appropriate solutions with the relevant authorities there. Shao and his party flew to Hong Kong yesterday. They are expected to stay in Hong Kong and Guangzhou for a week to ten days before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to relevant sources, the severity of smuggling in Hong Kong is threefold: (1) Export smuggling: For example, large quantities of tung oil are smuggled out, using the black market foreign exchange in Hong Kong, still yielding substantial profits. (2) Import smuggling: Imported goods that cannot be approved for import into the country often pass through Hong Kong as a distribution and transshipment point. (3) Overseas remittance smuggling: Due to the excessively large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate, many overseas remittances are routed through Hong Kong. Although there are no precise estimates for the amount of smuggling in the above three categories, the amount must be extremely large. They stated that Hong Kong's economy is closely related to China's mainland economy, and it cannot stand idly by and ignore the deterioration of smuggling. Therefore, they sincerely hope that this trip can achieve a satisfactory solution.</p>
<h3>Bao Da Bank Declares Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Bao Da Bank, located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road in the city, suddenly appointed lawyer Zhang Naizuo yesterday to announce liquidation. According to its liquidation announcement, it stated that it had recently been unable to continue operating due to the government's implementation of emergency economic measures and the unbearable pressure of high-interest loans, and had no choice but to declare liquidation. It also hopes that all debtors will bring funds to Zhang's law firm within seven days to repay their debts. All creditors are also requested to bring their credentials to register within the aforementioned period. It is reported that the bank is a partnership, managed by Chen Shaobo, and was reorganized and established last year, mainly engaged in general currency exchange business. This time, the losses amounted to 1.2 billion yuan, mostly from relatives and friends. The amount of registered creditors who came yesterday was less than 10 million yuan. Furthermore, Tianyu Securities, broker No. 192 of the Stock Exchange, also rented a portion of the bank's premises to operate a medicine market. Due to Bao Da's liquidation, it also hurriedly moved out a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Foreign Sales Peanuts; All Ports Release in Batches</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, presided over by Director Chen Guangfu, to discuss various cases as follows: (1) The principle of facilitating funding for the import of raw materials to manufacture export goods was resolved and passed, and will be sent to the Central Bank and other banks to discuss implementation procedures. (2) The International Emergency Food Committee has determined that China will export 1,000 tons of peanut oil this year, equivalent to approximately 2,240 tons of peanuts. Our country's exports this year have already exceeded the quota, so the customs has been ordered to temporarily prohibit exports, and all foreign sales of peanuts will be stopped. However, the peanuts purchased by the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries at various ports in our country were all released to those countries before the customs ban. The prolonged delay in transportation may cause deterioration. It has been decided to first select peanuts at various ports in the production areas awaiting ships for foreign sales, and release them in batches, followed by Shanghai, in order to increase the country's foreign exchange income, fulfill foreign contracts, and avoid stimulating the city's oil supply. (3) The Executive Committee has now stipulated that regular meetings will be held at the Central Bank every Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Customs Notice on Amendments to Regulations Governing Customs Brokers</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday stating: "Upon investigation, the Regulations Governing Customs Brokers, previously amended by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Customs, were announced in Notice No. 111. Now, Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the above-mentioned amended regulations has been amended and promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and transmitted to the Customs. Hereby, the amended provision is copied and announced for public information." The copied amended provision of Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Regulations Governing Customs Brokers is as follows: "If the applicant for a guarantee deposit from the local legal customs broker association is a member of the local legal customs broker association, the association may issue a guarantee as collateral. However, the association shall pay according to the number of members, with each member's guarantee deposit ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000 national currency units, as the association's guarantee, the amount of which shall be determined by the Customs Commissioner of each Customs."</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Calcium Gluconate</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>My humble article, "Calcium Gluconate," originally intended as a means of eliciting valuable opinions, has unexpectedly garnered attention from advanced thinkers, wise individuals, and authoritative scholars since its publication in the tenth issue of this journal. I am deeply honored. I am profoundly grateful to Mr. Wu Guocheng for using experiments to clarify the truth in the thirteenth issue. I am especially thankful for the guidance from Mr. Wang Qizhang, a senior figure in the medical community, in the fifteenth issue!</p>
<p>Calcium deficiency inevitably leads to tuberculosis, and tuberculous lesions consume large amounts of calcium. Therefore, tuberculosis is always accompanied by calcium deficiency, creating a reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship. This is the primary reason why tuberculosis patients need a large calcium supplement. Even if a special medicine for tuberculosis is invented in the future, perhaps a considerable calcium supplement will still be necessary, but perhaps not long-term injections. Once the lesions are healed, calcium can be supplemented again, just as injecting a sufficient amount of calcium after any major illness can help the body recover quickly. After any major illness, the lungs are inevitably weak. Injecting calcium can not only strengthen the lungs but also fortify the muscles and nerves. Therefore, calcium can also treat debilitated patients. As such, children with rickets, lung patients, and pregnant women indeed need large amounts of calcium. All weak individuals, especially children whose development is incomplete, need even more supplementation. Mr. Wang sympathizes with Mr. Song Guobin's assertion that "the elderly and those with syphilis do not need much calcium." If elderly patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are in the active stage, it is appropriate to weigh the urgency and give priority to the immediate need. If calcium is needed, it should be used immediately. Before more advanced drugs are discovered, there is certainly no time to consider the "induction of other diseases." Given that patients urgently need calcium, even if they are elderly, what can be done if the disease increases without supplementation? Under these circumstances, "inducing other diseases" is only a secondary problem, especially since it is not certain that it will induce other diseases. Calcium is ultimately not a potent drug. Mr. Wang also tells us that "excess calcium can be naturally excreted from the body," so there is naturally no harm from accumulation. If older people do not inject calcium, their blood vessels will still harden. If calcium is not needed, there is naturally no need for injections. As for syphilitic hemoptysis, diagnoses without blood tests are mostly mistaken for tuberculosis. Injecting calcium is naturally harmful and unhelpful, and will lead to misdiagnosis and delays.</p>
<p>For patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, oral calcium intake naturally does not have much effect. Mr. Wang believes that "once calcium passes through the digestive system, it undergoes complex changes," but this seems debatable. Before injectable calcium was invented, was tuberculosis also cured? If oral calcium intake is not suitable, as it is said to cause "complex changes," then oral calcium supplements should be naturally eliminated altogether? In fact, oral calcium supplements do have their own considerable effects. Otherwise, health experts in various advanced countries would not advocate supplementing calcium through diet. According to literature, there were also examples of using oral calcium to cure lung diseases in ancient China. A passage from the "Baji" (containing calcium) section of the herbal classic is copied below:</p>
<p>"A government official in Taizhou pitied a heavily sentenced prisoner. The prisoner was touched and said, 'I have committed seven capital crimes and suffered lung damage from torture. I obtained a prescription for "Baji" powder, which I took daily with miraculous effect.' Later, the prisoner was subjected to slow slicing. When his chest was opened, dozens of holes were seen in his lungs, all filled with "Baji," the color of which remained unchanged."</p>
<p>This passage probably isn't made up? It can be proven by experiments. Then it is clear that the decomposition and denaturation of calcium in the stomach and intestines is indeed different from the decomposition and denaturation in intravenous blood. However, it is all beneficial to tuberculosis, but oral administration has a weaker and slower effect. Intravenous injection is actually not ideal. In the near future, perhaps there will be an invention for direct injection into lung lesions, which would be the real goal. Clinically, calcium is used to treat cutaneous tuberculosis, often with miraculous results. It is believed that direct injection into lung lesions would certainly have unexpected results, but direct injection into the lungs could cause irritation, which is, of course, still a problem.</p>
<p>Lesions naturally need insoluble calcium. Mr. Wang believes that "to allow calcium to easily enter the bloodstream for transport and avoid thrombosis," it is necessary to "combine it with various acid radicals to form soluble calcium" to reach the destination – the lesion – where it "remains an insoluble calcium mass." However, in fact, this may not be the case, because calcium without various acid radicals can still flow freely in the blood without causing thrombosis, just as the editor stated in the comments added to my humble article: "The human body has its own 'controlling' function in controlling and regulating acids and calcium." Therefore, both soluble and insoluble calcium are beneficial for tuberculosis, just as fructose and glucose, and eating starch, can still become nutrients. Although it is reasonable to combine "calcium gluconate and vitamin C" for use, some people with unique constitutions occasionally have reactions when using them together. Whether used together or separately, such as "calcium" injected intravenously and "C" injected intramuscularly, there are similar reactions. Therefore, for these special patients, I do not advocate using them together; it is better to alternate them every other day. Perhaps Mr. Song Guobin's disapproval of using them together, and his vehement criticism of vitamin C, stems from experiencing the suffering of special patients?</p>
<p>For all fevers caused by toxins secreted by tuberculosis bacteria, in the absence of other causes, calcium can be used to reduce fever. General antipyretics are not a fundamental solution; calcium is the real antipyretic for tuberculosis fever.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's thirty years of experience, combined with chemical research, has revealed that "regardless of the type of calcium, when injected into the body, it undergoes several stages of acidification as it passes through various tissues, abandoning its original acid radicals and combining with carbonic acid to form insoluble calcium carbonate masses." This truth has been further advanced and revealed to the world, showing that calcium is injected into the body with the sole purpose of "fear of not acidifying and not causing a chemical reaction." I respectfully ask Mr. Song for his opinion from the standpoint of academic inquiry.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in my humble opinion, the discussion on the combined use of calcium gluconate and ascorbic acid is nothing more than old news, and there is nothing particularly insightful about it. The suspicion of Mr. Song's review is also a common feeling among most doctors in the world.</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Revision of Middle School Health Education Materials</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>—A Call to Emphasize School Health Education—</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Education convened a middle school curriculum conference to revise the middle school curriculum standards. This measure aligns with the background of the times and is being carried out to coordinate with the course of national construction. The current content of the health curriculum is dry and uninteresting and will be completely overturned, and new standards will be formulated separately. This is indeed worthy of earnest expectations.</p>
<p>The great educator E.G. Bonser said: "I believe that life, health, and education share the same goal, which is growth and the enrichment of experience." Originally, life is education, teaching people how to live? Teaching people how to live healthily? Of course, it is the primary goal, and there is nothing more important in the world than healthy living. Therefore, the revision of the middle school physiology and hygiene curriculum is necessary. Similarly, strengthening middle school students' health education and maintaining their healthy lives to increase educational effectiveness is even more necessary.</p>
<p>Currently, the poor academic performance of general students is attributed by some to students' lack of learning spirit, carelessness, perfunctoriness, and a tendency to take shortcuts. They also accuse students of not respecting teachers and valuing the Dao. From an educational standpoint, we believe that this view is not without its merits, but unfortunately, it only addresses the symptoms without tracing back to the causes, completely ignoring the students' health problems. Honestly speaking: Today's students are overloaded transformers. The heat converted from the nutrients they absorb is less than the kinetic energy they consume every day. Supplying the nutrients needed for four hours and expecting them to work for eight hours is impossible. It's like "eating green grass and squeezing out milk." They cannot maintain normal physical development, nor can they compensate for the necessary consumption. How can they have a high working ability? It's like "wanting the horse to run fast but not wanting it to eat grass," an impossible reality. Asking a patchwork, worn-out machine to have good working efficiency is a fantasy. Ignoring lifelong health and expecting students to have academic achievements is also impossible.</p>
<p>Today, many people think of schools as places to impart knowledge, invisibly treating education as a commodity, and even openly or secretly engaging in transactional practices, caring for nothing but the sale of knowledge. This is an unforgivable mistake. If you think that educational bankruptcy has nothing to do with students' health, you will naturally be unable to understand that health education is related to the success or failure of education. Neglecting school health education is at least one of the main factors in today's educational failures. Because education is life, it is the sum of using life experiences to adapt to life, and the main elements of life are clothing, food, housing, and transportation. However, all four of these are fulfilled through health. Because health includes the entirety of life, making individuals suitable for living and suitable for serving, it is said that: health is a function, it is the result of life, and it is not the purpose itself. Therefore, J.F. Williams of Columbia University said: "Health may be defined as quality of life that renders the individual fit to live most to serve best." Therefore, health education must be implemented in today's schools, and the purpose of school health education should be to maintain and enhance the health of both the educators and the educated. This is not just about treating or examining diseases, but about how to actively promote physical and mental health. However, what school administrators call "health education" often refers to medical services within the school. This shows a failure to clearly understand the true meaning of health education. School health and school health education are also often confused. Some even include all health services in the school within health education, and some regard health education and physical education as the same thing. What is the meaning of narrowing the concept of health education? Opinions also differ. Some say that health education only includes school health courses, but this fails to understand the true meaning of health education.</p>
<p>School health education is an organized activity and facility with the aim of cultivating habits, attitudes, and knowledge regarding the health conditions of all aspects of human physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Therefore, the activities and facilities of school health education must be continuous, conducted at different levels, and progress together with the ever-changing advancements of science. Its purpose is not only to pay attention to physical health but also to consider mental and emotional health, not only to impart knowledge but also to pay attention to the cultivation of both attitudes and habits. Modern health educators believe that health education should take behavior as the main goal, with knowledge secondary. We certainly hope that each individual can maintain their healthy behaviors and solve health problems. We must also teach them various health knowledge and cultivate important habits, behaviors, and attitudes.</p>
<p>Since the French government passed regulations in 1833 regarding school authorities' responsibilities for school health, until 1924 when 35 states in the United States stipulated considerable laws for school medical equipment and health training, countries around the world have strongly promoted school health education, especially the United States, which actively promotes school health education and regards it as a duty to be fulfilled by those responsible for education. In China, school health started earliest in Beiping, where the First Health Office and Xiehe Medical College jointly operated school health services. Later, major ports such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Nanjing also successively handled school health. In the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), the national government promulgated the School Health Implementation Plan, and the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education organized a School Health Committee. Various provinces successively established health education offices, county public education instructors, etc., with Jiangsu achieving the most significant results. After the War of Resistance, the Central Health Experimental Institute held school health education events in Shapingba, but they all focused more on school health rather than comprehensive school health education. In August of the year before last, the Central Design Bureau, the Ministry of Education, and the Department of Health jointly invited health education experts to formulate a national school health education promotion plan. In September of the same year, the Educational United Annual Meeting also passed a five-year plan to implement health education and entrusted it to the Ministry of Education for implementation. To this day, the plan remains a plan, and the project remains a project, with not even a fraction seen in reality. We are not without regret!</p>
<p>The middle school curriculum conference decided to reorganize health education materials, which is certainly a major reform in educational administration and policy. How to teach people to live healthily? Of course, it is the main concern of education officials in the future. Therefore, attention should be paid to those habits that can promote psychological effectiveness and behaviors that promote physical health, and more attention should be paid to the actual exploration of physical and mental health. Habits and healthy behaviors are also very important in current Chinese middle schools. We want to enable them to establish reasonable health behaviors based on hygiene principles and personal abilities.</p>
<p>Now school education is being reorganized and refreshed, and there will certainly be brilliant consequences in the future, but we still say sensitively: "Don't model the education of the student era after today's education." The times are evolving. May the education sector have a great awakening. In the future, "the first task of education is to enable students to obtain health." Schools should use educational methods to cultivate students' correct health concepts, mold proper health behaviors, to increase educational effectiveness, and use modern scientific medical equipment to prevent student diseases, protect student health, make the school environment fully meet hygiene conditions, and ensure that the lives of all school staff and students have health protection. This would be perfect!</p>
<h3>On Medicine and Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Luo Xiangwen</p>
<p>My country's medical and health undertakings have made slight progress in the past two decades. But when you talk about it, it really feels pathetic. In the past, I have never seen a complete plan; even if there was a plan, I have not seen it implemented. What's more, there is a lack of funds, a lack of talent, and no one to advocate for it. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, everything was based on military affairs as a prerequisite. More important departments and things to be done were not established. There was no financial or human resources to handle medical and health administration affairs. Affected by the wartime environment, it has been delayed until today.</p>
<p>It has been two years since the victory; there are thousands of things waiting to be done. However, due to the prolongation of the civil war, everything is still affected and cannot be improved or handled; how can we pay attention to the improvement and construction of medical and health administration.</p>
<p>Recently, the government reorganized and established the Ministry of Health; the Chinese Medical Association held its seventh conference in Nanjing; and the health authorities in this city registered medical personnel; these are all good news for the health protection of our nation. Although we are listed as one of the major powers, the increase in mortality rate; the backwardness of public health; I am afraid that we still occupy the first seat in the world. I believe that the people in charge of investigation and statistics in the health authorities will not deny it either.</p>
<p>Based on the above simple reasons; we hope that the following points can attract the attention and improvement of the health authorities; or thoroughly plan and implement them; in order to achieve good results.</p>
<p>(1) A complete health administration plan, I think the authorities have already formulated it, no need to say more. We only hope how to protect the health of the nation and gradually reduce the mortality rate. That is to say, how can we improve the level of public health enjoyment. Especially how to instill common sense in the people and how to promote, how to improve and other issues. If there is funding, talent, and a plan, we hope to be able to do it thoroughly. Formal paper talk, even if there is funding, talent, and a good plan, if you don't do it, it will not be effective. We want to appeal for the future of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>(2) Most of the existing medical personnel in our country are developing individual businesses. Because the public medical system has not been implemented, there are too many abuses. This has created a situation where rich people can hire doctors and buy medicine; poor people can only dream of it. Taking Shanghai as an example, I don't know how many people are licensed to practice medicine. If the government has a plan and organization. The harvest during the Anti-Japanese War was already considerable, no need for us to discuss it again. It is not too late to start from this now. Compile and organize medical personnel across the country, popularize and distribute them to the whole country, and penetrate into the countryside. After ten or twenty years, the health of the nation will be guaranteed. Public health can be developed and the mortality rate can be reduced, can't it be predicted?</p>
<p>(3) The method of examination for medical personnel held by the health authorities in this city is good. However, we can predict that the results of the examination will not be good. Because: there are big problems with the examination method. If you don't pay attention to the examinee's academic qualifications, years of service, and clinical experience. And only pay attention to the answers on the test paper; it is tantamount to ignoring the examinee's real talents, which is unfair. For example, if you pass the test very well, you often have less practical experience. Or if you have served for many years, the test paper may not be impressive; this is a definite phenomenon. If you ask a doctor who is officially practicing now to take the test again, where will he be able to completely pass the test in essence. These factual problems need to be studied.</p>
<p>(4) We believe that those who have several years of service experience and considerable academic qualifications in the country now should be allowed to continue to practice medicine. The authorities should have a broader vision. There are surplus medical personnel in Shanghai; but the cities and villages across the country are pitiful. Just look at the counties and towns along the Yangtze River with relatively developed transportation, the medical equipment is simple and the lack of personnel is already worrying. Other hinterlands are even more unimaginable. Why don't the authorities thoroughly allocate them? Even nurses who came from Shanghai, if they leave Shanghai, based on what they have seen and heard, I believe they can also take on the medical care of a county or village; the guarantee of people's health. At least better than the so-called quacks selling herbal medicine and treating diseases. Wouldn't it be better to conscript and arrange them than to ban them?</p>
<p>The above points are all written in a random manner. We support the authorities to have a plan, have talent, and be able to do it effectively. To ensure the health of the people; to gradually develop medicine and health; to improve public health day by day; to popularize medical personnel across the country; these are all extremely important and should be done. For the future of the Chinese nation; for the health of future generations, we should support the government to advocate and handle it!</p>
<h3>Infant Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Jiang Yang Minxian Zhou Deqin</p>
<p>Making cabbage juice or various green vegetable juices: Wash the vegetable leaves, chop them, add one bowl of water to two bowls of vegetables, put them in a pot, cover tightly, boil for five minutes, remove from heat and soak in the pot for half an hour, filter out the dregs, and it's ready.</p>
<p>(B) Cod liver oil: Infants can be fed cod liver oil after one month to supplement the lack of vitamin D in the milk. In the first week, take half a teaspoon every day, and after a week, take it twice a day, half a teaspoon each time. After another one or two weeks, take it twice a day, one teaspoon each time, and then maintain this amount. If infants are sunbathing in the summer after four months, their bodies can produce vitamin D, so the amount of cod liver oil can be temporarily reduced.</p>
<p>(C) Egg yolk, green vegetables, etc.: When infants are four or five months old, cooked egg yolk can be added to supplement the lack of iron in the milk. Start with about one-eighth, and gradually increase it. Later, both the yolk and white can be used. If infants are premature, the amount of iron absorbed during the fetal period is less than that of ordinary infants. They should eat liver soup (how to make liver soup - three ounces of liver plus ten ounces of water, simmer over low heat for thirty minutes. Turn off the heat immediately after boiling, pass through a sieve and use it.) and other foods rich in iron within one or two months. From the fifth month, you can add green vegetable puree twice a day to provide iron and other minerals, vitamins, etc., which also helps with excretion. Start feeding with one tablespoon, and gradually increase to four tablespoons.</p>
<p>How to make vegetable puree: Wash leafy vegetables, chop them, add a little water, cook until soft, rub them through a clean wire screen, and remove the dregs. The remaining is the vegetable puree.</p>
<p>(A) Cereal foods: Infants have no ability to digest starch at birth. The carbohydrates needed by the body are supplied by lactose in the milk. Saliva and intestinal fluids gradually develop enzymes that digest starch. At four months, you can give porridge that has been filtered, twice a day, one tablespoon each time, and gradually increase it. By seven months, you can eat four tablespoons each time. When infants first start teething, add a piece of toasted bread or biscuits to exercise the gums.</p>
<p>(E) Others (minced meat, minced liver, tofu, etc.): From the sixth month onwards, you can feed cooked and mashed fruits (bananas do not need to be cooked) every day, gradually increasing from two tablespoons to one whole, to provide vitamins, inorganic salts, and tissue maintenance. Most European and American countries start weaning at eight or nine months and can completely wean by ten or eleven months. If it is a hot summer, it is often delayed until the autumn. China can be delayed until after one year old due to the lack of milk. Gradual weaning methods should be used. First, use milk or other milk substitutes or supplementary foods to replace one breastfeed. Reduce it again after a week, and reduce it in turn until it is completely weaned. Sometimes, due to special circumstances, it is necessary to wean completely in a short period. On the first day, milk can be used to replace one time, and on the second day, milk can be used to replace two times. Replace them in turn until they are completely weaned. Sometimes, if you have to wean immediately, if the infant is under five or six months old, it is best to hire a wet nurse. Otherwise, use formulated milk. Initially, the milk content should be small and the amount of water should be large. Later, the milk component is gradually concentrated. By the tenth day, the milk should be increased to the proper component. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Apple Green Handkerchief</h3>
<p>— Gu Zhongliu</p>
<p>Hei Ni mended the cotton wadding that had been torn by the jujube tree, sewing a few stitches. Just as she was about to stick the needle into the thread board, her mother returned.</p>
<p>"Hurry up! I don't feel well..." Hei Ni's mother was shivering all over, her lips dark purple. "Your brother is waiting at the north end of the station!"</p>
<p>"Coming!" Hei Ni stood up, stepped forward to help her mother to the bed, and after her mother lay down, she covered her with the tattered coarse cloth quilt. Then, she hurriedly left the small earthen house, wrapped tightly against the cold wind, and walked towards the station.</p>
<p>The weather was indeed cold. The wind scraped Hei Ni's face like a knife, her teeth chattering crisply. Her nose was constantly running, and after wiping it once with her hand, it would drip again in no time.</p>
<p>As Hei Ni approached the station, a group of elementary school students returning home from school walked towards her. Some wore bright sweaters, others wore black overcoats, all looking lively and cheerful, like spirits of spring.</p>
<p>Hei Ni often encountered these elementary school students. Hei Ni often picked up coal cinders near the station.</p>
<p>When the elementary school students saw how frozen Hei Ni looked, a little girl in a red sweater blurted out a mocking rhyme:</p>
<p>"Little Hei Ni,</p>
<p>Nose running free,</p>
<p>No handkerchief, alas, to wipe it, see..."</p>
<p>Hei Ni pretended not to hear, lowered her head and walked on, trying her best to stop the mucus from flowing, but it just kept running...</p>
<p>Making Hei Ni almost cry.</p>
<p>Hei Ni had firmly said in her heart: "I will never go to the station again, even if I die!"</p>
<p>But, in order to eat, Hei Ni had to bite the bullet and still often went back to the station to pick up the exhaust from the train engines.</p>
<p>Spring has arrived. The ice on the small river has melted. The ground is soft and yielding... Hei Ni's nose no longer runs. Hei Ni, coming and going at the station, no longer looks worried and sad. Her head is held high, and her round eyes gleam with light. A beautiful smile blossoms petal by petal. An indescribable joy fills Hei Ni's heart.</p>
<p>This day, Hei Ni and her brother picked up a full basket and a full torn cloth bag of coal cinders next to the train engine spewing thick smoke. Her brother told her to take the basket of coal cinders home first. Hei Ni stayed by the railway for a while, then lifted the heavy basket and walked home. Sweat poured down her face. The happy Hei Ni didn't realize how unattractive her face, covered with coal dust, must look. But because of the warming weather, and because of the beads of sweat dripping down, a fantasy grew in her heart, a dream of getting a handkerchief.</p>
<p>"If I only had a piece of cloth to wipe my sweat, I would be happy!" Hei Ni said to herself. "Little Hei Ni, no shame, face unwashed, ugly, ugly!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the mocking sound that Hei Ni was so familiar with and hated rang out again, ruthlessly thrown at Hei Ni...</p>
<p>Hei Ni took off the tattered cotton wadding she was wearing. The sun was getting warmer and warmer. Although it was only March, it already felt like early summer.</p>
<p>In the dazzling sunlight, Hei Ni walked towards the station. Her hands were no longer tucked into her sleeves, swinging back and forth, but walking with hops and skips, more lively than in winter; one could hardly recognize her as the same child.</p>
<p>Looking at a tender sprout breaking through the earth here, looking at a patch of green grass growing in the spring breeze there, Hei Ni was walking on a small path to the station when suddenly an apple-green handkerchief appeared before Hei Ni—a poor little girl who longed to have a handkerchief. Hei Ni suddenly stopped and stared blankly; she couldn't believe her eyes.</p>
<p>"Is this real?" A pile of question marks jumped in Hei Ni's mind.</p>
<p>She looked around. There was no one around. So, like a thief for the first time, Hei Ni excitedly bent down and picked up the handkerchief, hurriedly stuffing it into her pocket. Hei Ni glanced around again. This time she still didn't see anyone, and she calmed down a little.</p>
<p>But how short-lived were peace and joy for Hei Ni! Hei Ni's mind started working: she recalled her fantasy, the fantasy of getting a handkerchief did exist, but she had never once thought that the handkerchief that would belong to her in the future would be picked up from the road. She recalled the tragic scene of a pickpocket being caught and beaten during a village temple fair...</p>
<p>Hei Ni thought as she walked. The more she thought, the more she felt that she shouldn't have picked up this handkerchief. The handkerchief in her pocket felt as heavy as a stone, making Hei Ni uncomfortable; like being pricked by needles, her heart ached. Hei Ni suddenly felt that not having a handkerchief to wipe her nose or sweat was not embarrassing, but picking up someone else's lost handkerchief was truly embarrassing! If others saw her using it, they would definitely say she stole it!</p>
<p>So, Hei Ni took out the apple-green handkerchief and raised her hand high, shaking it above her head.</p>
<p>"Whose handkerchief? Whose lost handkerchief?" Hei Ni shouted loudly.</p>
<p>A man wearing an old bowler hat tilted to one side walked over, smiled coldly, and revealed two gold teeth. This gold-toothed man reached out and snatched the handkerchief away, ignoring Hei Ni, and walked towards the station.</p>
<p>Although Hei Ni suspected that this apple-green handkerchief was dropped by this annoying fellow, when the handkerchief fell from her hand into another person's hand, like a dog in the distance avoiding barking at the poor, she felt truly at peace in her heart.</p>

<h3>Rambling Weeds, Six Quatrains Expressing Sentiments</h3>
<p>— Ruo Nan</p>
<p>Thirty years of floating on the sea, my body is light, drifting to the ends of the earth, a sorrowful traveler's feelings; everywhere the passes and mountains are impassable, the proud bones of poetry and books have ruined my life.</p>
<p>My nature is unconstrained and my spirit is bold, I deeply pity the world's current that is surging and vast; who knows me begging for food by the river tide? I entrust a handful of sorrow to the Songs of Chu.</p>
<p>My life is like a tumbleweed, old age in a high hall with white hair; the night watch is exhausted, the residual lamp extinguished, my heart a thousand times weeping in the dawn wind.</p>
<p>I remember the pearl in my palm in the past, half a lifetime of sorrow and joy as faint as smoke; when will I pass through the mountains and rivers after the calamity, my haggard face in the east wind, tears sprinkling on the stationery.</p>
<p>My livelihood is difficult, tied to my heart, I have no good poems to send in a poem tube; now seven things are expensive to plan, I regret reading scriptures with empty sleeves.</p>
<p>My lofty ambition has been worn away, the beautiful years like Lu Du are thrown into the passing waves; I sigh that life is truly a dream, on a clear night I cry sadly when I sing.</p>
<h3>Head of Emperor Constantine the Great</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fourth century BC, in the center of Rome, countless large and small statues were probably erected. Two giant statues were twenty-two to thirty-two feet high, in addition to eighty gilded god statues, seventy-three gold and ivory god statues, and three thousand seven hundred and eighty-five bronze statues; the number of marble statues was too numerous to count. The statue of Emperor Constantine the Great was one of them.</p>
<p>This head and other incomplete parts were excavated from the south corner of the Basilica. During the time of King Innocent VIII (1484-93), it was collected in the Capitoline Palace. The lower end of the neck is made into a wedge shape, which proves that this is the head of a huge commemorative statue. The hairline across the forehead suggests that there was a metal crown. According to historians, the statue may have been a seated statue of Emperor Constantine the Great, with the head, hands, and feet made of marble. This work is now in Rome, and if its height is based on a seated statue, it should be at least thirty-two feet. In the photograph, a young girl is sitting below, and her height is not even as high as the face of the statue. The tallness of the whole body can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Purple Fluorescence</h3>
<p>— Xie Zi</p>
<p>I always think that if I get inspiration, I must write a perfect work. This work is brewing and incubating in my heart, but it has never had a concrete image. I regard it as a part of life, the totality of thought, and I regard it as an eternal gift. However, this work is too serious, too serious, and whenever I think about it, I cannot help but have a joyful and fearful tremor.</p>
<p>In fact, whether this work will be produced is not important. I don't quite understand what inspiration is; I just vaguely feel that inspiration will come one day. One day, it will be like a ray of strong sunlight, piercing through the clouds of my mind, allowing me to recognize myself and experience life anew in that brilliant light. At that time, I will write a perfect work, no, my life will be written into a perfect work. My life still has many blanks waiting for that stormy torrent of words!</p>
<p>I don't know if my talent will wither in such waiting, in such vague waiting. I even think that inspiration will only come when my talent withers. If that's the case, I'd rather it wither sooner, rather it bloom without bearing fruit, or bear fruit that doesn't ripen. I would rather exchange this bit of pitiful talent for inspiration, use this bit of purple fluorescence to exchange for brilliant sunshine. I have an excessively beautiful vision of life, and this vision forces me to make this kind of sacrifice, to make this choice. This sacrifice is not a compromise; this choice is not a mistake. I would rather live in my work than write in life.</p>
<p>But then I think, when my talent withers, will I still recognize that inspiration? Isn't a sky full of sunshine a cruel irony for a blind person? At that time, it should be a hazy white light: you can't see flying islands, you can't see flowers, you can't see the world's extravagance and sublimation; you can't see anything. A person whose talent has withered, even if he walks into the Garden of Eden, cannot find the beauty he longs for, the joy he desires. Because he has lost even this bit of longing, this bit of hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>So I remind myself, hurry, hurry! It's too late if you wait any longer. Life can't stand being delayed over and over again. If you miss this village, there will be no shop in the next. I must decide immediately, chase urgently, I must change all the sacrifices and choices I've made in the past. But thinking it over, I always feel that I lack encouragement. I lack a driving force.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also think that if I could get a confidant, a true confidant, use his strength to dispel my laziness; use his clarity to drive away my hesitation; or just rely on that little feeling of gratitude for knowing a confidant, I could gain the courage to be reborn, comfort myself, encourage myself, and immediately pick up a pen and paper, and create a magnificent work.</p>
<p>However, in this world, it is not easy to find a confidant. Everyone is busy looking for a confidant, but no one is willing to understand others. As a result, everyone cannot find a confidant, nor can they be a confidant to others. In loneliness and helplessness, they can only stubbornly pity themselves, sigh, abandon themselves!</p>
<p>In the end, I still think of that bit of purple fluorescence. Only it is my own; it illuminates my path in the darkness, and accompanies me in loneliness. How can I bear, how can I bear to destroy it?</p>
<h3>Musical Quotations</h3>
<p>— Zhong Qi</p>
<p>Everyone should listen to some music, read some poetry, and look at some good paintings every day. (Goethe)</p>
<p>I have thought so, and dare to say: Apart from theology, music is the highest art. (Selected)</p>
<p>Music is a more practical course than reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, etc. (Dr. P. P. Claxton)</p>
<p>Every well-educated young man and woman should be given correct basic musical knowledge at an early age. (Ruskin)</p>
<h3>Watching a Play</h3>
<p>— Tian Ji</p>
<p>"How many people are acting, and how many people are just watching the play!" Walking out of the Tianchan Theater, the friend in front said with great emotion.</p>
<p>I don't know what caused this emotion, and I didn't bother to ask. Treading on the slippery road in the drizzle, I waved goodbye after walking for a while.</p>
<p>Although it was past midnight when I got home, I couldn't fall asleep after lying in bed. "How many people are acting!" For no reason, I suddenly remembered my friend's words, and I also sympathized with his emotion.</p>
<p>The clock next door struck one, but my eyes became more and more awake. In order to squeeze out some cluttered thoughts from my brain, I picked up a novel that was placed on the head of the bed, Pu Liuxian's "Awakening the World Marriage," opening to the part where Liu Jinyi twisted and turned to make his play-acting nephew an official: "It's also a scene for us grandfathers and uncles, so let them both stop this business, call them to Beijing, support him to make a future, choose a state or county assistant, although it is a stopgap measure, it is still stronger than a fake official on the stage."</p>
<p>It's really a coincidence, it's acting again. Liu Jinyi's idea is also strange, the fake officials on the stage can actually be real officials in the world. Then, it is true that "the stage is a small universe, and the universe is a big stage." Thinking about it carefully, it is not surprising, Tang Wang proclaimed himself emperor in Guangzhou at the end of the Ming Dynasty, removing thousands of officials a day, the crowns and clothes were all fake actors, the stage and the universe have been combined into one family, it did not start today.</p>
<p>"The stage is a small universe, the universe is a big stage" I don't know who came up with these two sentences in the beginning. Although it has become a cliché today, after careful thought, the meaning is still quite interesting. It is not to say that "coming out as a general" and "entering as a minister" are like real events, but the front and back stages of the stage are really like the surface and inside of a small universe.</p>
<p>Dressed in silk and wrapped in white, laughing, scolding, and being angry, you don't know the inside story until you get to the back stage, you don't know how much blood and tears and how many youths and lives are hidden here.</p>
<p>In "The Attack on Zidu," why does that martial artist perform so many styles alone? Those skills that were exchanged for life seem so superfluous here. If watching a play and watching tricks are two different things, I feel that these tricks in old plays like "The Attack on Zidu" should be cancelled, that is to say, a certain amount of blood and tears and life can be saved.</p>
<p>My thoughts gradually turned to a scene I saw on the way back to Shanghai a year ago. At that time, I was trapped in a county town for a whole month, and a theater troupe lived in the backyard of the hotel. Looking down from the back window upstairs, I could see a fat man of about forty years old teaching an eight- or nine-year-old girl to stand upside down on the ground with her feet in the air and her hands on the ground. After the posture was set, the person who probably belonged to the boss picked up his small teapot and went to chat with others. The girl stood upside down there, sometimes half a point, a little, or even more than a little. I turned back to sit down and read a book for a while, and then looked at the window, and she was often still standing there. This way, several times a day, several points at a time, after resting for less than five minutes, she had to stand up again: this is probably what is called practicing kung fu. Sometimes the two standing legs would just hit her head. If the boss caught a glimpse of it, her face would immediately turn iron-blue, and then the rattan whip would fall on her body. If she fell down because of being beaten, the rattan whip would fall down like a rainstorm.</p>
<p>After that, the posture was that she bent her two legs backwards, until her two feet touched the ground. I saw from the window that she had a hand-and-foot print every day, and the distance of this print was getting closer and closer, until it was almost connected. The girl's eyes were always filled with tears every time.</p>
<p>"Still crying! So useless." One day, I was sitting and reading a novel when this sound led me to the window, followed by the ping-pong sound of the rattan whip.</p>
<p>I also remembered the few circuses that I had watched in the past, which were actually just playing with people, and what I got was the stimulation of the destruction and persecution of tender lives. I suspected that this was a plaything only for sadomasochists. Ordinary people can only bring back unhappiness. After that, I stopped watching this kind of circus without horses. But I didn't expect that behind the "small universe" was also this scene. Because of this, I was depressed all day long. One day, a newly acquainted companion came to my room, I pointed it out to him and told him my feelings.</p>
<p>"It's all like this, you can't be flexible if you don't practice your body." The strange thing is that he didn't think it was strange at all. Then he hummed, it was also Peking opera.</p>
<p>"Are you surprised?" he stopped singing and asked me.</p>
<p>I didn't answer. I just thought that acting is like life: acting is life, learning to act is also life, and the whole life is acting.</p>
<p>The clock has struck two. The words of that friend rang in my ears again, "How many people are acting, and how many people are just watching the play!"</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 521</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Whistle..." Shouyi gently let out a whistle.</p>
<p>"Whistle whistle...?" Someone responded from the shadows on the side.</p>
<p>"09...?" Shouyi asked, aiming at the source of the signal.</p>
<p>"...15." Before the reply was finished, a thin, small figure flashed and ran to the side of the car.</p>
<p>"Thank you, thank you!" Shouyi comforted the person who came.</p>
<p>"You've worked hard!" The person responded; "Less than a hundred yards ahead, we have another small sentry post. After that post, it's a wasteland. After walking through the wasteland, that small Western-style house is the den. According to reports, there are searchlights and light machine guns mounted on the roof." The voice of the person was sharp, quite like a woman's voice.</p>
<p>"Thank you... Has anyone from our side been here?" Shouyi seemed a little anxious.</p>
<p>"At my station, no one from our side has passed by in the last hour. Even the other side, or irrelevant people, only three to five people have passed by, most of them are locals."</p>
<p>"Is this Hongzhen?" Hejian asked tentatively. After leaving Shanghai, he seemed to have become a country bumpkin.</p>
<p>"Two or three hundred yards north of that wasteland is the border of Hongzhen." The little guy responded.</p>
<p>"So, if someone detours from Hongzhen and enters the bandit den, can your station see it?" Hejian asked about Hongzhen, which turned out to be intentional.</p>
<p>"Detouring is also possible, but it's a third farther than this road, and it's all small roads, so you can't drive... But it can also be determined that no one from our side has entered the bandit den from that side..."</p>
<p>"How do you know?" Shouyi asked.</p>
<p>"There are two simple reasons; first, we also have a sentry line over there, and if someone from our side passes by, a signal will be sent. But I didn't hear the signal. Second, if someone invades the bandit den, I'm afraid it won't be so quiet, and you won't even hear a gunshot. It seems impossible."</p>
<p>"Isn't there a little disturbance?" Shouyi was still a little unconvinced.</p>
<p>"At least from my side, there is no slight disturbance... To the east, two or three hundred yards east of the den, we also planted one or two sentry lines. I don't know if there is any news. Because it is too far away from here, and there is this den in the middle, I don't want to disturb them, so we agreed not to transmit news unless it is extremely important, extremely urgent news..."</p>
<p>"Doesn't the other side set up a defense line?" Hejian thought of the other side's calmness.</p>
<p>"The other side's strength is probably all in the den; there are no outposts outside, only mobile patrols, in groups of five or six; they patrolled once half an hour ago, with a careless attitude, not serious at all; it can be inferred that the den is definitely not very nervous—perhaps they think no one dares to raid the den... but the strength is quite solid."</p>
<p>"I plan to go into the den to investigate." Shouyi discussed with Hejian.</p>
<p>"I'll go too!" Hejian was very firm.</p>
<p>"So, do we go together or separately?" Shouyi wanted to see Hejian's courage.</p>
<p>"Either way is fine! It just depends on which action is more beneficial."</p>
<h3>Rambling Talks on Solitude</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Professor Borges said it well: "What good are all these magnificent new streets and bridges to me? If I can't think on them the way I like."</p>
<p>I think thought is more necessary for people than breathing. Can you imagine what a person would look like after stopping breathing for five minutes? Can you imagine the pain of a person being forbidden to think freely?</p>
<p>I can't help but think of a story.</p>
<p>It was probably something from ancient Greece. There was a wise man who was the first to realize that the earth was round, but this statement violated the religious concept of the time. So the priests, who held the power of life and death, grabbed the wise man. Then, with a knife on his neck, he was asked to admit his absurdity and faithfully shout: "The earth is square!" In this way, the knife could leave his head, otherwise, the knife would sweep across his neck; his head and body would be separated.</p>
<p>"I can say that the earth is square." The wise man said calmly. Just as the knife was about to leave his neck, he added frankly, "However, however, the earth is actually round." The knife finally swept across the wise man's head.</p>
<p>What is absurd is the priest's knife. Who said that the knife can kill the truth?</p>
<p>This wise man first illuminated our dark human history. As for his death, it only shows us the inevitable fate of all prophets.</p>
<p>Goethe said it well: "I am too old for everything, except for the truth."</p>

<h3>Blood Lessons - Written for the May Thirtieth Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>Today, twenty-two years ago, the situation in Shanghai was also turbulent, and the surface state was more serious than that of today's Shanghai. From the shooting of Gu Zhenghong, a foreman at the Shanghai Japanese Naigaiwata Textile Company, to the outbreak of the Nanjing Road Massacre, the entire China immediately converged into a tide of anti-imperialism. The crowd on the eve of the Great Revolution not only made powerful voices in action, but also shocked the imperialists in practice. The boycott movement against Britain and Japan at that time made it impossible for foreign goods to be seen anywhere in China.</p>
<p>We failed diplomatically in the May 30th Incident; because the imperialists only compensated the victims with a limited amount of pension. But from the perspective of anti-imperialist struggle, this was the first bomb of resistance from a small and weak nation. Since the Shanghai Massacre, there have been the "June 11th Massacre" in Hankou, and the "June 23rd" Shameen Massacre in Guangzhou. The imperialists certainly showed their hideous faces everywhere, and applied military pressure, but this promoted the unity of Chinese workers. The long-term strike of nearly 100,000 workers in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in 1925-26 can be said to have laid the foundation for China's subsequent revolutionary unification.</p>
<p>From the lessons of blood, we know that the front line of struggle must require unity; secondly, the purpose of struggle must represent the interests of the majority of the people. If these two basic principles are violated, the price of sacrifice is not worth it; naturally, there is no talk of success. After the May 30th Incident, the reason why it could immediately shock the whole country, and all circles in various places rose up to support it, was because everyone was based on the same understanding, the same interests, and the same goals. Therefore, everyone has always worked together in the same position.</p>
<p>Now Japanese imperialism has fallen, and the unequal treaties of the powers in China have also been abolished one after another. However, the situation in China today has not yet revealed a glimmer of light. Although the red-headed police officers on Nanjing Road have disappeared, no one dares to deny that the air on Nanjing Road is peaceful. What we hear and see is a tragic scene! The suffocation and pain in people's hearts are as deep as they were twenty-two years ago.</p>
<p>What is especially sad is that in this depressed atmosphere, many people are almost numb, their emotions have been declining, although they are angry, they can only sigh.</p>
<p>On the occasion of this bloody commemoration, recalling the bloodshed of the martyrs will make us doubly vigilant!</p>
<h3>Are There Only Two Directions at the Poles?</h3>
<p>— Jiang Juling</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Danyan, and I argued for a long time about the direction of the two poles. I said there is only one direction at the poles (the North Pole only has south, the South Pole only has north), but Mr. Danyan stubbornly insisted, with "a lifetime of cleverness, confused for a moment," that there are also east, west, north, and south. Thus, the argument began. I used a ball to represent the fixed North and South Poles, proving that there is only one direction. Then, Mr. Danyan expressed "surrender," and I won the debate. Based on theory, I further explained that when an airplane flies to the South Pole or North Pole, the compass needle must rotate one hundred and eighty degrees. Mr. Danyan vehemently denied this again. However, when I drew Shanghai and New York, two places on opposite sides of the Earth, on the ball, and showed that an airplane flying from Shanghai to New York via the North Pole would require the compass to change direction and become a "south-pointing needle" if it were to maintain its original orientation, Mr. Danyan conceded defeat again. However, she said that when the airplane reaches the "polar point" (note) of the two poles, the compass needle would be stopped or rotate erratically until it passes over the "polar point," and only then would it undergo a one hundred and eighty-degree change; no correct change is possible if it only "flies to" and not "flies over." I thought carefully about it and realized that what she said made sense because at that point, all directions would be south.</p>
<p>These are all theoretical debates. What it's actually like in practice remains to be determined by explorers circumnavigating the Earth north and south; moreover, the actual size of Antarctica is still a mystery. If you simply observe the maps of the eastern and western hemispheres and note the significant difference in the distribution of land and water on the north and south sides of the equator, you might suspect that Antarctica might have a very large landmass. Furthermore, we have only circumnavigated the Earth east and west, and there is no record of circumnavigating north and south through the poles!</p>
<p>(Note) This is Mr. Danyan referring to the "extreme point" of the two poles, rather than the "pole" or "polar line" of the "polar point" in geometry.</p>
<h3>Partridge Sky</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>When Councilor Duan Zhuo described the difficulty of transportation on the railway from Xi'an to Tianshui, he specifically cited a popular folk story, saying, "An old man boarded the train with a half-price ticket. When the ticket inspector asked him why, he replied that he was a child when he bought the ticket, but by the time he squeezed onto the train, his beard and hair had turned white," which caused a roar of laughter throughout the hall.</p>
<p>A half-price ticket is undoubtedly for a child.</p>
<p>How does boarding the train transform one into an old man with white hair?</p>
<p>Councilors known for humor all laugh,</p>
<p>But in the end, the road to success still passes through!</p>
<p>Words may be clever,</p>
<p>But the metaphor is loose.</p>
<p>How many refugees long to return home?</p>
<p>Hoping to become wandering souls in a foreign land,</p>
<p>Forever longing for their homes separated by ten thousand mountains!</p>
<h3>Reading "A History of China's War of Resistance"</h3>
<p>— Fengyun</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce to readers this monumental historical document published after the war: "A History of China's War of Resistance" by Cao Juren and Shu Zongqiao. We, having traversed the eight years of war filled with blood and continuous gunfire, should look back and see the arduous and long road we have traveled in the past. In those scenes of raging flames, blood, and tears, there are indeed many meanings worth learning from and lessons worth taking.</p>
<p>Japan has been defeated. A worshiper of fascism who wanted to rely on "power" and "violence" is now submissively prostrate before "justice" and "fairness" in the world. This is, of course, a matter of course. However, what we cannot help but be concerned about is that only a little over a year after world peace, even as the pain of those around the globe burned by the flames of war has not yet subsided, we can hear the scent of gunpowder everywhere again. The confrontation between two major camps; mutual suspicion, fear, and vigilance; are these the only lessons that the world war has brought us?</p>
<p>Let us take Japan as an example. Under the care of General MacArthur, its light industry has gradually returned to its original state, and its export trade is about to erode the Far East again. The Japanese people's demand for the minimum level of military equipment within the country is also brilliantly regarded as an event not worth surprising.</p>
<p>But in China over these past two years, as I leaf through "An Illustrated History of China's War of Resistance," a monumental work including 400,000 words, I cannot help but lament our bewilderment and unease.</p>
<p>China, in the Far East, in Asia, and in the entire eastern hemisphere of the world, should be the force of stability for world peace. When the whole world fears that a third world war is about to descend upon the world, how eagerly do the people of the world hope for China? They not only hope that China will embark on a path of peace and happiness, but also hope that China can truly act as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, turning many misunderstandings and disputes in the world into auspiciousness and jade and silk.</p>
<p>This is just as the author of this book especially mentioned in the "title page": "The 'Big Four' status that we won with the great sacrifices of the long-term war of resistance was reduced from 'Big Five' to being excluded from 'Big Four' in this year of the war's end. We look at our position in the international community and think about the evil situation brewing in the Pacific Ocean in the future. The future is bleak, beyond imagination."</p>
<p>This feeling of lamentation is not just a representation of the author's state of mind.</p>
<p>"An Illustrated History of China's War of Resistance" has a total of 448 pages, with over 1,000 images. The entire book is divided into ten chapters. The war history on which it is based strives for truthfulness, and the narration is able to achieve objectivity and impartiality. Many materials are citations from the records and works of third parties, striving to avoid subjective judgments. This point should be the most valuable aspect of the entire book.</p>
<p>The "Commentary on Historical Materials of the War of Resistance" in the appendix is the author's explanation of his attitude and methods in handling the materials, which can serve as a reference for all compilation works.</p>
<p>This epic, including the most valuable eight years of China's War of Resistance, is one that every reader should treasure.</p>
<h3>Qing Dynasty Physician Ye Tianshi</h3>
<p>— Huiguang</p>
<p>Ye Tianshi was a famous physician of the Qing dynasty, and there are many anecdotes about him. Once a person becomes famous, legendary stories spread, often exaggerating and embellishing, which cannot be easily believed. However, there is one story about Ye Tianshi that is quite interesting, and I will record it below:</p>
<p>After Ye Tianshi became famous, those seeking treatment came in an endless stream. One day, he was being carried in a sedan chair when a villager greeted him on the side of the road and begged him to treat his illness. Ye stopped the sedan chair and examined him, saying, "All six pulses are harmonious. What is the illness?" The villager said, "You are a famous doctor, and you can understand all kinds of difficult and dangerous diseases. What I suffer from is poverty. I don't know if you can cure it?" Ye smiled and said, "This disease is quite easy to treat. Come and get the prescription tonight, and one dose will cure it." At dusk, the villager knocked on his door and begged for medicine to cure his poverty. Ye instructed him to collect olive pits in the city and plant them. When the seedlings grow, come and tell me, and you will get a great profit. The villager did as he was told. After a few days, the seedlings grew vigorously. He ran to tell Ye. Ye said, "From today, when there are people seeking seedlings, raise the price and don't sell them cheaply!" Ye himself used olive seedlings as a medicinal guide in his prescriptions. Those with illnesses vied to buy them. After a few days, the seedlings became scarce, and the number of people seeking them increased. The price increased. The villager made countless money. When the seedlings were gone, the medicinal guide was also removed. Later, the villager prepared a gift to thank him. Ye said, "Is the illness cured?" The villager said, "Thanks to your help, I am completely cured." Ye smiled and sent him away. To this day, the people of Wu still tell this story as a beautiful tale.</p>

<h3>White Elephant (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>White Elephant is my family's beloved cat. Originally, it was the beloved cat of my second daughter, Lin Xian, and even earlier, it was the beloved cat of old Mrs. Duan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the War of Resistance, old Mrs. Duan took White Elephant with her to flee to the rear. After the victory, she brought it back to Shanghai, where it lived near my second daughter, Lin Xian, and my son-in-law, Song Mufa. For some reason, old Mrs. Duan entrusted White Elephant and its only son, Little White Elephant, to Lin Xian and Mufa, and they became their beloved cats. When I went to Shanghai, Lin Xian and Mufa entrusted White Elephant to me, locking it in a cage made of Wuxi gluten, taking it on the train, and bringing it back to Hangzhou, where it lived in a small house by the West Lake and became my family's beloved cat.</p>
<p>White Elephant is truly a lovable cat! Not only because it is snow-white and as grand as an elephant, but also because its eyes are one yellow and one blue, called "sun and moon eyes." When it walks out of the sunlight, its pupils are so narrow that they are almost invisible. Its eyes look like two lights of different colors installed on a theater stage. Everyone who sees it is amazed and praises it. The person who collects electricity bills almost forgets to take the money when he sees it. The police officer checking household registration also temporarily stops checking when he sees it.</p>
<p>After White Elephant came to my house, Mufa and Lin Xian often wrote letters, saying that old Mrs. Duan had moved elsewhere but often visited them to see Little White Elephant, with the purpose of asking about White Elephant's recent situation. My youngest daughter, Yiyin, sympathized with old Mrs. Duan's sorrow of separation and often took photos of White Elephant and sent them to Lin Xian to pass on to old Mrs. Duan to comfort her longing. At the same time, she showed even more care for White Elephant. Every day when Yiyin returned home from school, or when her elder sister, Chen Bao, returned home from teaching, as soon as they sat down, White Elephant would jump onto their laps and sleep honestly and unceremoniously. They couldn't bear to refuse, so they would sit still and ask people for tea, water, a change of shoes, and the newspaper. Sometimes when the workers weren't around, my old wife and I would act as servants, delivering tea, water, shoes, and newspapers. We really served White Elephant.</p>
<p>One day, White Elephant disappeared. We searched everywhere but couldn't find it. Just as we were worrying, it quietly returned with a tabby cat. Everyone was pleasantly surprised. My daughter, Xiuying, said it was a male cat from Zhaoxian Temple. After saying that, she laughed. After a short pause, everyone laughed. It turned out that it had gone to the Buddhist temple to find a lover without telling anyone, causing us to be worried to death.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Only when Old Xu heard the last two sentences did he nod in agreement.</p>
<p>"Is it still possible to replenish the goods now? You are, after all, an amateur!" At this point, he still couldn't forget that business is business.</p>
<p>A very natural reply welled up in Old Zhu's mouth, but he didn't say it because he didn't want to use words to strike this failed profiteer off a national crisis at this time.</p>
<p>"Amateur or expert, it's best not to talk about it at this time." He tried his best to reduce the sarcastic element, but Xu Shaoming's face was already flushed. "So what are you planning to do now, old brother? Is there anything you need this poor man to run errands for you?"</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming gave a bitter, emotional laugh.</p>
<p>"I don't have any plans right now. Anyway, I've lost everything, so whether I flee or not doesn't matter." He rubbed his hands together vigorously. "It's just that I can't lose all those goods for nothing. People from the military came to inform me just now that any merchants who suffered losses in this ammunition truck explosion can receive some compensation, as long as they can provide evidence. Fortunately, all my goods were on the books, and the books didn't burn..."</p>
<p>Old Zhu also understood the mentality of these standard merchants very well: "Money above all else, goods first." Since he had nothing to offer him in this regard, it was best not to give advice.</p>
<p>"I came to town to find a car. Judging by this situation, I'll probably have to stay here with you for a few days, old brother!" Of course, he could only give a few perfunctory words to these kinds of people, and in fact, Old Zhu's heart was also burning with anxiety. It was almost eleven o'clock, and if he couldn't find a car in two more hours, he wouldn't be able to leave today. Others might be able to wait, but what about Lan, who was seriously ill? Therefore, he decided to immediately return to the highway station to wait for passing vehicles. Xu Fatty didn't keep him either. As they were parting, Old Zhu couldn't help but add:</p>
<p>"Your relative, Mrs. Hu, and Feifei are with us."</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming waved his hand listlessly, still walking back to the pile of tiles where he had been sitting. It was as if he hadn't heard what Old Zhu said.</p>
<p>With a cold laugh of mockery from the bottom of his heart, Zhu Zhaonian immediately quickened his pace and hurried away.</p>
