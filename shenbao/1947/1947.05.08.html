<p>〔合衆社南京七日電〕國府委員會復討論物價問題，一致同意解除一月份凍結之生活指數，並交有關各部草擬經濟新措施。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕政院張院長七日在國務會議第二次會議席上，就政府安定全國經濟之原則，提出報告，渠對經濟緊急措施方案，加以檢討，認爲若干點應予加强，若干點應予修正。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕財長俞鴻鈞七日晨在國務會議報吿財政。兪氏謂：財部目前中心工作，係在如何使預算收支接近平衡，故財政上一切措政均以增加收入爲目標，在政策之運用方面而言，一為強化稅制度，一爲配合經濟政策，促進生產之發展；一爲調度金融，以求幣値之穩定；一為控制預算，以減少不必要之支出。同時，更運用公債物資政策，以吸收社會游資，利用國際剩餘經濟力量與敵爲財產售價，以爲收入之補充。繼對於執行本年度國家總預算情形，作一簡單之檢討，原預算列收入七萬三千餘億元，支出九萬三千餘億元，但因年度開始以來，和平統一迄未實現，交通受阻，生產停滯，致財政所憑藉之經濟事業，受重大之影響，國庫收支益難適應。自一月至四月，向爲淡徵時期，又各省表報尙未到齊，根據解庫數字，其收入約共二萬餘億元，至支出則約五萬餘億元，估計五月至年終八個月間，尙須支出約十二萬餘億元，連已支數共約十八萬億元，如再從寬增列預備費二萬億元，共須支出廿萬億元。</p>
<p>國庫存有大量黃金外匯</p>
<p>在收入方面，除整頓稅收等收入可超過總預算三萬億元，共為十萬億元，現在發行之美金公債與庫券，可得四萬八千億元，而剩餘物資之售價及接收敵偽財產，因外匯匯率改訂，可望增加收入二萬餘億元，故收入方面希望可達到十七萬億元，其不敷之數，正在另籌妥善財源，以資彌補。兪氏復指出，近日外界對發行數字每妄事揣測，其實截至四月底，祗有六萬餘億元，國庫存有大量之外匯及黄金，故準備異常充足。</p>
<h3>各機關辦公費　增加比數核定　十二省市補貼費共達千餘億</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕各機關辦公費，經核定增加比數如次：（一）經常費照原額增兩倍至兩倍半，（二）特別辦公費，照現行支給標準增加兩倍，自五月份起實施，所有預支之經費，在各機關追加預算內統籌，事業機關應在原核定事業變內勻支。（三）文職人員特別辦公費增加三倍，計五院院長卅萬元，副院長廿七萬元，府委。文官長各省主席，政委廿七萬元，立委。監委廿四萬元。又關於公用事業及煤斤補貼總數共三千六百十億餘，其中五月份滬市共六十六億八千七百五十八萬三千元。又冀·閩·甘·黔·康·陝·熱·察·綏·京·靑島·重慶等十二省市卅六年度之總預計，歲入共計一千二百六十四億餘，歲出二千一百九十九億餘，政府貼補一千零三十四億餘，此案經七日國務會議通過。又追加駐日代表團經費共美金八五·〇四一。入四〇元，國幣一一三·一四〇·〇〇〇元。</p>

<h3>戰前存款加倍還本</h3>
<p>辦法擬就日內公布</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕戰前存款加倍還本辦法，業經財部與四聯總處會同擬就，並已於日前送呈行政院，短期即公布。按國防會以前討論此一問題時，曾有兩派主張，一派認戰前存款還本應以複利爲計算標準，另一派則主以物價倍數爲準。聞財部與四聯總處硏討此一問題時，雖以銀行存款爲主要對象，然對此一辦法公布後，其對公私債券處理所可能發生之影響，亦曾予以考慮。</p>

<p>〔本報太原六日電〕趙承綬由正太前綫歸來，據談，共軍此次由冀西犯，集中四個縱隊十二個旅，由聶榮臻，蕭克分任正副指揮官，企圖直迫太原，但以國軍奮抗，共軍傷亡達二萬人，攻勢遂暫吿挫阻。現共軍正集中平定，壽陽整理，以消耗共軍之人力物力來說，吾人已獲得成功，以陂壞來說，則共軍達其目的。</p>

<h3>旅大視察團即出發　軍警進駐問題尙待商決　中蘇條約蘇方另作解釋</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕接收旅大問題，大致已解決，現僅一點尙未經蘇方同意，此即我方軍警將隨同接收人員同時進入旅大之問題，外次葉公超七日四時出席記者招待會答記者問時，曾就此强調說明。葉氏稱，蘇大使昨提交外部之覆文，依外部慣例，在交涉期辦竣前，不應公佈，惟我外部曾於四月十七日照會蘇方，內容爲我接收旅大所擬採取之程序及如何進行接收，並涉及依照中蘇條約之規定，共同經營中長路之有關事項。照會中亦提及於接收前派視察團赴旅大，蘇方對此已表同意，惟我軍警同時進入旅大問題，尙未獲致雙方均能滿意之方法。視察團將在最近期間出發，團員中包括董彥平，張劍非等。關於新聞記者是否可隨說察團前往問題，葉氏稱，原則上政府歡迎記者隨往採訪，目前尙無任何報紙向政府提出請求。至是否能隨視察團前往，政府正考慮中。又關於我軍警進入旅大問題，其最大爭議點乃係根據中蘇友好條約中關係旅大駐軍問題一條之解釋。該條文略稱，戰爭時期旅順海軍基地之防區（包括大連在內）蘇方認爲在中日和約未締結前，應仍視為戰爭時期，而我方則認爲戰事早已停止，日本軍事威脅已不存在，故不能仍視爲戰爭時期，而基於蘇方之看法，即我方軍隊不僅不能進入旅順大連，亦不可進駐。</p>

<p>問，軍事情勢如何？山東最近之軍事發展，政府是否滿意？共軍最近對山西之壓迫，其嚴重性如何？</p>
<p>答，昨晨十一時卅分奪回泰安之後，魯南國軍已與濟南區之國軍會師。共軍殘部正向泰安北面及東面之山地逃竄，山東共軍之處境甚爲狼狽，蓋其控制魯南之泰山及徂徠山據點失去之後，無法再在山東立足，且因其部隊之中大部分爲當地所徵募之民兵及民國，咸不欲離開鄕里，故又無法全部撤離山東，頗有進退兩難之苦。山西之軍事情勢，事實上並不如若干報紙所報導之嚴重，雙方主力尙未接觸，晋北僅有共軍一萬左右，正太綫亦不過一二萬共軍而已。</p>

<h3>物價問題再檢討</h3>
<p>昨天上海市塲，股票大跌停板，一般物價也多有下跌趨勢，據傅當是銀根帛緊之故。可見一個月來的物價瘋狂上漲，大概不無與信用膨脹有關。但我們還不能因爲昨天的市况，京可過早樂觀，坐待我們之步步下跌。物價問題依然要特別重視。</p>
<p>抑平物價，原是民衆普遍的要求，也是政府一貫的政策。勝利以來，政府曾經多方努力，並經採取各種手段，而結果還是不斷地上海，至多在某時暫時地緩和一下而已，可知憶往或現在所採行的對策，縱非藥不對症，失去功效，便是執行不力，未能達到預期的目的。今試分別再行檢討一番，以供懲前毖後之助。</p>
<p>一是限價與誶價與談價　勝利之初，本市已有物價評議會的組織，其後一再改組，如食米，食糖，燃料，紗布，食汕等皆經過相當時期的試騐。平心而論，也未嘗沒有收到相當緩和的功效。自經濟緊急措施方案頒行以後，此「議價」之法遂被正式普遍地採用。不過黑市愈形猖獗，物價愈見上升，放多議價，早已告朔　羊，形同具文，到了最近，米的限價終於正式取消，恢復自由買賣。這種痛苦的紀騐，與其說是限價議價本身的失敗，毋寗說是辦理上的未盡妥善反致。其故有三：（一）議價失掉時間性，未能隨時設法調整，致造成了公開的黑市；（二）所定的價格，太不合理，許多商人，認爲賣出以後，未能捕進，未能再生產，致形成了陽奉陰違的惡習；（三）偏於一隅，未能與有關各地，取得密切的聯緊，致　生貸物倒流，或產價超過的現象。這種缺憾如果事前能慎密規劃，事後能悉心彌補，也不是無可挽救的。</p>
<p>二日取締囤積操縱這是平價時必要的手段，也是當局最努力的表現。所惜黑市太普遍，囤風太熾烈，一般商民太不合作，至有官商門法，罰不勝利的景象，而且囤積居廳的取締，依法亦自有種種必經的手續，這在非常時期取締日用重要物品囤積居廳辦法內，規定得十分詳密。現在合法利潤，大都還沒有明白規定，所囤貸物，也沒有規定價格，地點，時期，令其出售，地方官應更沒有代爲出售或收買的準備，甚至所囤的貸物，所銷的貸量，在同業公會與主管官應也俱沒有登記，報告，或檢查的手續。空間何種交易是合法？何種條件始構成劇中廳行爲？多數人還是莫名其妙。大家不過隨心所欲，隨意應付，以求敷衍於一時。所以一部份的正當商業，雖覺左肆支右細，不勝其肆應的艱苦，而真正囤戶奸商，反都漏綱法外，極盡其操縱抬價之能事。這種責任，我們認爲應由多方面共負的。</p>
<p>三日拋售物價　這是抑平物價最切實的辦法。所惜拋售的步驟，所拋的對象，以及事前的審核，事後的檢查等等，手續上的問題，似乎準備欠周，未能盡符理想，致公家蒙受了甚大的犧牲，而距離平價的目的依舊甚重。徒使許多投機家渾水摸魚，獲得種意外的利益。從黃金，人絲，紗布，米，糖這些拋售的事實看來，我們這話，總不見得過甚其辭罷！有人以爲公家拋貨，往往追隨黑市，未免領導漲價，與抑平物價這宗旨根本不合。其實所拋物資，如果連無　考，任其流入黑市，那末，一般用戶與消費者，終不會沾到平價的實惠。換拘話說，物價始終平不下來，因爲廉價上所得的利益，已給許多第三者層剝削去了，與消費者無關！</p>
<p>四是抽緊銀根　銀根抽昆，即是游資回籠，亦即緩和了通貸的膨脹程度。歸理論說，確可以收抑平物價之效。在過去，也有不少實便　可舉的。問題是國家收支未能平衡以前，所謂游資回籠，終不過暫時的性質。即一面收進游資，一面仍不免放出頭寸，於整個的通貸問題上，並不能發生多大的作用，而一出一信之間，在物價上，却不免起了一陣人爲的波動，在生產上，尤不免受到高利的威脅，就物價的觀點而論，這種手段，也未必可說完全成功。</p>
<p>五是限制出境　禁止出境如米麵等，限制出境如紗布等，其目的皆在保持存底，以免物稀爲貴，其用意自屬無可厚非。不過這也是一時權宜之計，未可據爲典要。所以然者，上海原是一個通沒大埠，其重要的功能即在流通受到限制，便會妨礙到了生產。去年，麵粉業曾一度起不到生產過剩，要求解禁，紗布禁止南運以後，爲時不久，也就變通爲限額輸出，這都是很明顯的例子。而且在瘋狂的走私之下，這種限制的實效究有幾何，實在也是個疑問。何況上海可以限制紗布麵粉出境，則他省何甞不曾如法炮製，限制食糧出境，把中國劃爲許多「小」國界，只有更刺激物價的。</p>
<p>以上這幾個辦法，不但在過去施行過，在現在也還是採用着。然而一般物價愈漲愈商，與當局的平價政策，恰巧北道而馳。可知由今之首，無　今之俗，要希望物價就此可以逐漸平落，恐怕過於奢望吧！</p>
<p>當然，高物價要抑平物價，實非專彈藍調所不能濟事了的。我們認爲：就局部　，應不惜勞費，將民生日用必需品，按照戶口，實惠及於消費者，以免流入黑市。就全局論，則除一面汰除冗濫，平衡預算，一面扶植生產，增加供應以外，實無其他途徑可循。倘貪圖簡易，避免合理與合法的手續，而枝枝節節，事從事於「不澈底的管制」，其結果無非造成黑市，助長投機而已！更因不澈底的管制之結果，而或至因　廢夜巡，妨礙正當的生產事業，尤無異引　自殺！</p>

<h3>法社會黨大會表決擁護　賴瑪迪繼續秉政　並通過九項新施政方針</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎七日電〕法國社會黨中央委員會昨夜通宵會議，直至今晨二時二十分始散，當以二·五二九票對二·一二五票，決定擁護該黨領補賴瑪迪之政府留任。事前賴氏致詞稱，「中央會議倘對余有所命令，余將於明日向歐禮和總統提出辭呈。但須聲明者，即余倘簽署辭呈，余將感覺正在簽署共和國之退位書」。賴氏並警告稱，在目前情勢下引起閣漸，將危及貨幣與經濟方面，敵應加以防止。社會黨秘書長莫萊反對賴氏，一再要求政府辭職，但前總理勃魯姆則支持賴氏。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎七日電〕社會黨全國委員會於巴黎時間今晨三時二十分，以二·五二九票對二·一二五票，決定支持賴瑪迪總理之要求，使已無共黨閣員之聯合內閣繼續供職。按上屆社會黨大會曾有社會黨僅能參加有共然員之政府之決議，故今日之決議，實爲法國戰後政治史上之新發展。自今日起，法國政府將在共黨及共黨所控制工會之反對下實行治國。在表決之前，會中曾有十二小時之激辯，賴瑪迪以及勃魯姆均力促大會贊成社會黨之繼續秉政。通過社會黨繼續秉政以後，大會復一致通過社會黨閣員今後施政方針之決議案，莫要點如下：（一）注意共產黨之拒絕同意抑低物價平穩工資之政策；（二）在議會政權制度正遭威脅之際，重申有保持內閣一致行動之必要；（三）社會黨決不參加以反共爲號召將使國家演成分裂之集團；（四）政府若受反動派多數之支持，社會黨即行退出政府；（五）要求社會黨在政府中之代表與工會組織，保持密切接觸；（六）要求社會黨在政府中之代表，設法調整反常之低工資；（七）對糧食之分配作有效之管制；（八）促政府調和歐洲及世界之社會主義派及民主派，以免兩大對立集團之形成；（九）要求越南之和平。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：自法國社會黨全國大會投票支持賴瑪迪之排共政策後，罷工風潮蔓延各地，威脅賴氏之凍結工資計劃。據最近報吿，法國各地爲要求增加工資而罷工之工人至少在五萬人以上。</p>
<p>美申明對法政策不變　義注視法國政局發展</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓六日電〕外傳法國發生政潮，係受美國對法態度之影響所致，此說頃由美國務院發言人予以否認，並謂美國對法政策迄無變更。美國各報駐巴黎記者紛紛來電稱，法國賴瑪迪內閣若能將共黨排斥在外，則美國準備增加對法之經濟援助，又謂法國共黨若企圖奪取政權，美國援助法國即將停止云云，凡此各說均非事實。據美駐法大使賈佛萊來電，凡此各種傳說，均無事實根據，美國駐法大使館並不知之云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕法國社會黨今日舉行秘密會議，討論賴瑪迪內閣逐出共黨閣員後之命運，其決議對於法國甚至西歐政治前途恐有遠大影響。同時羅馬來電稱，義大利政治領袖正密切注視法政局，義總統加斯貝里領導之基督民主黨，一部份黨員籲請加氏步法國後塵，與共黨宣吿決裂。多數法國人認爲義政局頗與法國相似。保守派世界報評稱，社會黨如向共黨投降，此即自身之末日。吾人在法國境內將有兩稱反對集團，如同世界各地久已互相反對之兩集團然</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬六日電〕此間觀察家預料義政府日內將有更動，據悉俟財長康比格里及工商部長莫朗第，於五月十日至十五日間向制憲議會報吿國家之經濟狀况後，加斯貝利總理即將要求制憲議會對政府投信任票。加氏表示希望勞工協會人員之一能出任閣員。</p>
<h3>華萊士著文論　美對法政策</h3>
<p>謂可能造成不幸後果</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約七日電〕華萊士在今日出版之新共和雜誌上著文稱，渠在巴黎獲得此項印象，即美國向法提出貸款方案，以該國自「進步精神」向後倒退爲條件。華萊士稱，如法國選中爲「杜魯門主義」之第二個試騐塲所，此事似屬可能，定可預料其造成不幸之「災禍」。華萊士繼稱，利用美國龐大經濟力量驅使法國向右，加入反蘇集團之任何企圖，可能引起流血。美國觀察家一致同意，「在法國造成如此形式之陣綫，定將引起罷工，暴動，或甚至流血云」。</p>

<h3>聯大政治委會　通過決議三點　阿猶得以同等地位列席陳辭　五強對調查團組織意見分歧</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖六日電〕聯合國大會政治委會今日開會，討論美國之修正案三點：第一，准許猶太公會與阿拉伯高級委會以同等地位陳述意見，此點未經表決，一致通過。第二，政委會在未聽取巴勒斯坦阿猶雙方人民之意見時，不作最後決定，此點稍經討論即予通過。第三，任命調査委會就何種巴勒斯坦團體有陳述意見資格一項問題，提出報吿。此點頗引起爭執，阿根廷代表表示反對。烏拉圭代表稱，鑒於英當局與猶太人民間之摩擦，英國不應參加決定何種團體代表巴勒斯坦人民。蘇聯與南斯拉夫表示附議，最後以三十一票對四票，決定任命五人小組會，由哥倫比亞。波蘭·瑞典·伊朗與英國代表組成，檢討巴勒斯坦各團體陳述意見之聲請。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：英政府方面人士稱：史達林曾向貝文保證，關於修訂英埃條及蘇丹未來　位，英國與埃及兩國間所發生之爭執，蘇聯願始終保守中立。埃及當局曾宣佈：關於談判經年陷於僵局之英埃條約問題，埃及將提付聯合國仲裁。據稱，貝文在莫斯科晤見史達林時，曾討論英國在近東地位問題，史氏似重視英國在中東及埃及之地位，而並不以爲英國在該處之利益與蘇聯之利益相牴觸云。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約六日專電〕聯大政治委會今開始辯論擬議中之巴勒斯坦調査委會之組織與範圍，五强於此，非僅對委會之組織意見分歧，即對其任務之性質範圍亦然。大體言之，中美兩國主張其爲一「中立」之委會，然蘇聯則認爲中立委會，在政治上無力可能性。法國認爲中立委會無何力量，因之主張若非五强全體參加，則由美蘇二者參加。英國爲與調査委會有直接關係之一國，並爲其原有之一會員國，今則持靜觀態度。關於委會之工作範圍，美英中法四國主張盡量廣大，使之可調査巴勒斯坦問題之一切方面，蘇聯尙未表示態度。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕搶米風潮最近兩日巳憂延及於本市。昨日尤多，經記者探悉者，一日間計有六處。（一）滬東哈爾濱路二一七號泰豐米號昨晨八時左右，尙未開門營業，突有羣衆潮湧到來糶米。當被撞開排門，搶去白米四石半。經虹口賽分局街警拘獲李貴生一名帶局偵訊。據供，因見有人往該號搶米，伊亦隨衆入內眉負白米半担而出，致遭拘獲云云。（二）虹口東餘杭路五一六號鼎豐米舖，向社會局領得配給紅糙米十二包，至昨晨八時，已售去七包，因市售配給米須先辦理登記等手續，費時甚久，致遭外面羣衆不滿，一聲喊吶，衝進搶米。結果被搶去白米七担半。當經警察趕到，拘獲六人，計董安甲，戴可榮，陳汝仿，陳阿金，陳阿毛，宋曹餘，帶局偵訊。因宋曹餘家中有吃奶嬰孩，罰鍰二千元釋放，其餘均拘押二天示儆。</p>
<p>（三）海寗路北河南路口六三九號凌萬泰米號，昨晨向社會局領得配給米卅五包，在店中配售。因出貨手練太慢，致引起列隊購米之居民不滿。中午，卅五包食米業已售完，然待米鍋之鄰近居民爲數仍衆，遂大嘩。一聲呼打，該號之門窗全被搗毁。幸北站分局聞訊，派遣大批警員趕到彈壓，然居民仍不散，遂由凌萬泰繼續拋售食米十二包，未及半小時，已吿售罄，羣衆仍不滿，再度起鬨，旋警察總局派遣警備車二輛，到塲彈壓，驅散羣衆，始告無事。</p>

<h3>指數解凍在即　各業喜懼交併　總工會促從速實現　市商會請縝密決定　七工會要求無條件解凍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市勞資雙方對生活指數解凍之事，極表關切。昨日中央印製廠上海廠及上海廠一廠，鉛印業職集工曾，商務印書館產業工會，正中書局職工代表團，世界書局職工代表團，中華書局產業工會等七單位代表五十餘人，於昨日下午分至總工會及社會局請願，要求政府立即無條件解凍生活指數。指數並須切實編製，反對虛造。當由總工會理事長水祥雲及社會局勞工處長趙班斧分別接見，囑各工人安心工作，中央對此，日內即可有決定。總工會亦於午後召開理事聯席會議，決議請政府從速解凍指數。據理事長水祥雲表示：政府雖在原則上通過指數之解凍，但辦法尙未決定，總工會即在討論萬一事實等於指數不解凍時，將採取何種措置。</p>
<p>商會昨分電政院及社經兩部，請到生活指數解凍辦法，於勞資雙方，務須兼籌並顧，縝密決定。原電略稱：「生活指數解凍，工商各業喜懼交併，所喜者，工人最低生活獲得合理保障，則此後安心工作，增進效率，生產前途，同受其利。所憫者，鑒於過去高工資之威脅，於購買力普遍低落之時，而成本陡然高漲，且又無法預計，將使民族工業不勝負荷。應如何兼籌並顧，折衷至當，惟祈中樞周詳硏討，縝密決定，總期公布以後，勞資均得其平，施行不感困難」。</p>
<p>又此次谷部長在滬商定之指數解凍方式，不止一種，除昨日報上發表之兩種外，尙有另外一種。即將工資分成三十元一級，三十元至一百元一級，一百零一元至一百五十元一級，一百五十一元至二百元一級，二百元以上另列一級。除三十元基本數不打折扣外，其餘各予以相當之折扣，依工資之大小累進。有關人士表示：凡此種種方式，目前均非定案，政府自當兼顧勞炎兩方之利益而決定，雙方此時宜靜待結果，不宜先作表示。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕市敎育局局長顧毓琇，及副局長李熙謀，擬將本年暑假本市各大學入學考試與高中畢業生會考聯合舉行，前曾邀集各大學校長初步商談，咸表贊同，惟事屬創舉，諸待繼續磋商，乃於昨日下午三時，邀集專科以上學校校長及公私立高中校長，假康樂酒家舉行茶會。到光華大學朱經農，同濟董洗凡，曁大李壽雍，交大裘維裕，震旦胡文耀，大夏魯繼曾，大同胡敦復，商學院朱國璋等及公私立高中學校校長五十餘人。由顧局畏主席，並說明數點：（一）大學入學考試，戰時在後方曾舉辦全國統一招生及數大學聯合舉行考試，困難雖多，而辦理結果甚佳。（二）中學畢業會考之利弊，討論甚久，迄無結論，今姑勿置論。敎育部今年暑假令上海市舉行高中畢掌會考，可能以上海戰後中學成立甚多，以此測騐各校辦理之成績。（三）吾人本敎育立塲，且並顧政府法令，商得一可行之新辦法，以助上海數千靑年學生之畢業與升學，實屬必要。繼由各大中學校長及代表，就舉行聯合考試之種種技術問題，紛紛提出討論或建議，均經逐一紀錄，作爲將來辦理考試時之參考。旋經通過聯合考試辦法如下：</p>
<p>聯考辦法</p>
<p>（一）本市公私立大學（包括獨立學院及專科學院）三十六年度第一學期新生入學第一次考試與三十五年度第二學期高中畢業會考聯合舉行之。（以下節稱聯考）。（二）聯考由各大學及市敎育局組織聯考委員會辦理之。（三）命題，試卷，監試，試務，計分等事宜，由聯考委員會主持之。（四）考生應于考試前，由原校塡報畢業後升學或就業之志願，如願升學並應塡明第一，第二，第三，第四，第五等所願升入之學校院系，但以參加聯考之大學院系爲限。（五）考試科目，以國文，外國語，算術，理化（生物），史地，五科爲限。（六）命題範圍，遵照部頒課程標準（七）願升學之學生由聯考委員會，依其成績及志願，徵得各大學同意後，分發各大學肄業。（八）凡高中普通科應屆畢業生，參加聯考成績，合於分發各大學標準者，即作爲中學學業會考及格，其成績不及分發各大學面合於最低標準者，亦得計入中學畢業會考成績。此項辦法，須呈經敎育部核准施行。</p>
<h3>英大遷校運動　晉京請願團昨由金首途</h3>
<p>〔本報金華專訊〕國立英士大學全體學生，劇烈發動遷校遝動，二日起，各院一致罷課一節，業誌本報。茲據確悉：該校「晋京請願團」一行五六百人，定七日晨，乘金杭班車赴杭轉滬，直達南京，車上膳食，一律以饅首代餐。聞該校敎授一百七十餘人，爲同情學生是項運動，並爲促進英大發展起見，特對敎育部「分配大學網，英大應在金華」一項規定，擬定數點辯駁意見如下：</p>
<p>（一）以各地區文化發展狀態而分，金華旣非浙東文化中心，更非浙江文化中心。（二）以地圖上幾何圖形劃分大學網，則金華侷促於浙東一隅，絕難發展。（三）以交通而言，金華除浙贛綫金杭一小段外，其他地方往返均不便，例如：浙東溫台寗紹一帶同學須歷時五日始達，蘇皖閩贛各地學生更非繞道滬杭來金不可。（四）金華本身，一切落後，舉凡面積，人口，敎育，風景，社會環境，均不適宜於容納此龐大學府。（五）紀念英士先生，當爲「全國性」的，金華旣非首都，又非省會，更與英士先生一生歷史毫無關係良不足表現其紀念性。（六）要求遷校，於法有據。敎育部三十二年六月二日二六二四七號訓令：令國立英士大學，奉行政院本年一月六目仁嘉字七九〇四號指令，經堤交六〇六次院會通過，「自三十二年四月起，改爲國立，其永久校址，設浙江吳興或上海，戰爭未結束前，暫設浙江泰順」，此令。敎授方面，根據上述理由，認爲有遷校必要，擬指定南京，杭州，寗波三地，作爲敎育部選擇新校址標準。</p>

<h3>銀根突緊市場人心虛怯　華股一致跌停板　惟商務中紡兩種不跌反漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券市塲，連日本已有外强中乾之象。稍受刺戟，便起風波。昨日銀根突緊，傳空頭退票達二十億之鉅。一說中央將有新措置，對付布塲投機。又謂多頭號家咸接到一種警吿函件，遂致人心惶惶。銀行帮更有大量實貨塞出。故開盤即在一面倒之形勢下，紛紛斬殺，跌風悽厲，爲近日所罕見。前市除商務外，一致跌停。美亞塲外有喊低一板，永紗亦降落甚巨。午後為港申匯投縮影響，銀根轉鬆，各股始由疲轉穩。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>人心已疲，各股均低，遞永紗開後，八五號一八三號一〇二號二三一號一六三號一七一號一八六號均售，賣風大盛。美亞由一六九號九一號，火柴由二三五號，中絲由一八九號一六號，榮幾由二二三號，首先掛低至跌停。新華亦達限度。即起賣風。步降至六一〇〇元光景。二三一號九四號一六〇號二一九號六八號二〇五號一二九號四七號趁低有納，曾回升至六二七〇元左右。無如一五二號買胃奇殷，永公大通信和新光華豐景綸等亦紛紛跌停，人心轉虛，各項物價聞亦普遍下降，一一二號一一七號一五四號一、六五號一六七號一五二號八二號七三號一二六號八九號一九七號等均了結，於是永紗亦吿跌停矣。美亞再跌一板有成交。此後塲內除商務外，幾全部跌停。近午永紗低三百元有成交，結果較前收計商務僅降半成，五和跌停後有回，軋低一成弱。遞交計動興跌停後有回，軋低成半不到外，餘股均告跌停。永紗場外有喊低至五五〇〇元者，後聞港匯報漲，喊價急回。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>塲外已高，祗做即交。永紗由一五三號一二六號買進，上塲即升爲六〇三〇元。九七號一二五號賣出，仍吿跌停。一〇五號二二三號四號之供給，曾喊低至五七五〇元，二三五號一五號一四號二一九號二一一號一八三號進胃忽暢，聞銀根見鬆，升爲六〇五〇元。一九六號一二五號一〇五號復賣至五九〇〇元。一八五號一五二號九七號二三一號二〇五號二二五號一四號一一七號連袂購買，商務由二三一號首先掛停，中紡亦由八九號掛紅，反動回漲到六二五〇元以上。一二五號二二三號九七號逢高脫手，曾退至六一〇〇元左右。一一七號一九六號仍買，臨收又升至六二〇〇元外。收後喊價微穩。結果較前收計永紗因全日祗半天交易，跌一成强。華豐增資，後市暫停，與美亞同告跌停，信和新光永公景福勤興新華跌停後有回，軋低各計一成弱迄一成强不等。遞交計半天交易，永紗信和美亞華豐新光永公景福均跌。勤興跌停後微回，低成半弱。冷股計新亞跌停，商務漲停，中紡由跌停變漲停，軋升半成强，餘股跌停後均有回上，各跌半成至一成不等。塲外各股計南洋跌二成弱，中華世界微降，餘尙平和。</p>
<h3>外股初疲後穩</h3>
<p>外股昨初疲後穩，環境不利，證劵帮咸售。怡紗晨開七六〇〇〇元，英聯一一五〇〇〇元。低價達怡紗六九五〇〇元，英聯一一〇〇〇〇元內，午收稍穩。港申電迭次報縮人心一振。廣帮及銀錢業有納，怡紗升至八一五〇〇元，英聯一四二〇〇〇元結束。較前收計鋼業漲一成，英聯升半成，餘者榮辱咸微。</p>
<h3>公債續跌</h3>
<p>公債昨晨俏午疲，業中人五〇三室五五五室俱售，統丙晨開一九〇〇〇元，自一九二〇〇元起，盤跌至一五二〇〇元。午刻略盤，結果較前收計甲乙各降一千八，丙跌二千六，丁挫二千二，戊小二千元，成交約七百萬。</p>
<h3>多頭出籠棉紗傾瀉</h3>
<p>昨日紗市因銀根抽緊，各紗號忙於應付紡建之頭寸，及出貨等事塲中買戶奇稀，更有獲利多頭出籠，致現貨籌碼充沛，價遂下瀉。四十二支藍鳳收價一千二百二十萬元，猛降一百三十餘萬元之鉅。二十支雙馬最小曾至六百十萬元，收價稍形回上爲六百三十萬元，軋小八十萬元。其他二十支以上各紗，亦挫十萬元外，十六支紗軋降三五十萬元。</p>
<h3>紡建售紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售一〇八九件內廠商六五九件，紗號四三〇件。廠商申請單共四二〇張，紗號申請共三五七戶。</p>
<h3>布價回跌</h3>
<p>棉布市况，因連日由業外人收購，價格哄抬甚高。昨爲市上銀根緊迫，更以紡建公司供售頗暢，染廠細布申請者，全數核准照配，布號亦多照申購單供售，塲中浮多吐售，而北帮客人因申請出口困難，在市脫手，是以價遂狂瀉。十二磅龍頭細布由三十萬元小至二十七萬五千元，比上日猛挫三萬八千元，五福爲二十六萬元，亦小二萬七千元，其他藍鷄彩球等牌一致回降，自二萬餘元至三萬元不一，二十支特細布收價廿三萬元，金印元嗶嘰由廿八萬小至廿七萬元，四君子金印直貨呢倒貼三萬元賣出尙乏受戶。其餘色布士林布等，亦一致下降，人心渙散，市氣轉疲。</p>
<h3>已拋出十六萬餘包　社局改訂配米辦法　南北兩市場隔日輪流拋售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米恢復自由賣買後，吳市長識米商：仍應以適度價格成交，不得任意抬價，以維民食。當局每日之配米九千包，則決定實行新辦法，隔日輪流拋於南北市塲，由兩市塲各組米店輪流配供。故昨日之白粳九千包，均拋於南市塲，北市塲一包未拋。該項新辦法係將全市米號業劃分區組，共分組一百八十單位，間日輪配，例假順延。假定配米爲九千包，則每一米店小組得承配五十包。各米行分組經配之地區，及其各區米店小組之單位，均經抽籤認定。</p>
<p>昨據社會局發表：自四月十五日至五月七日止，社會局共拋出食米一六一三六五包。內分白粳，紅秈，暹米及西貢米四號。出倉數量截至五月七日止，已繳款者共計一二八九二六包。其餘尙在辦理出倉手續中。</p>
<p>產區混亂難算成本</p>
<p>又訊：物價評議會米糧小組於昨日開會，米商因產區各地情形混亂，計算成本困難，故討論並無具體結果</p>
<p>籌備平民食糧公賣</p>
<p>社會局昨日召集本市各區公所及警察分局代表，討論籌設平民食糧公賣處。出席吳局長及各區各局代表十餘人，由吳局長主席，即席議定各點如後：（一）下列各單位可直接向社局申請配米，公私立以上學校學生（走讀生在內）及敎職員，市立中等學校寄宿生，市立中等學校（省及國立）學生，私立中等學校學生及敎職員，小學敎職員，產業工人，碼頭工人，慈善團體，囚犯，棚戶貧民，此外各報館通訊社職員，亦由吳局長與中宣部駐滬辦事處主任馮有眞洽定，認係新聞工廠，應予列入，共計一，五〇二，四〇五人。其中學生教員計十萬人。（二）每人每月皆可購置定量米糧或麵粉，成人每月二斗，貧民每月一斗五升，貧苦兒童每月九升。（三）配價依照公敎人員同等待遇。（四）愛民區公賣處，實由閘北，揚樹浦，滬南等九區施行。會後據吳局長稱：此項辦法，擬呈糧部審核後，公吿施行。公賣處成立後，拋米將予伴止，戶口配米亦擬終止，其餘市民可向自由市塲購米云。</p>
<p>米市臨收漸呈回軟</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市昨日到貨仍稀，計南市塲八一六石，北市塲八一〇石。市價交易初頗堅俏，待收市時漸呈回軟。白粳高貨做卅萬元，中貨廿九萬元。薄稻高貨卅萬元，中貨廿九萬五千元。早稻高貨做廿九萬五千元，中貨廿九萬元　　秈　廿九萬元，杜秈廿八蘊元，糙粳廿九萬元，　秞高貨廿八萬元，中貨甘七萬元。白元高貨做卅一萬元，稍次卅萬元。陰元亦做卅一萬及卅萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉雜糧均見低跌</p>
<p>〔又訊〕麵粉雜糧价格昨均見回小。洋粉十五萬八千元，小一千元。本粉十萬五千元，跌去五千元。麩皮七万七千元，疲落六千五百元。豆餅跌四五千元，黄豆下降五六千元，紅糧苞米隨之下挫二三千元，生仁回跌萬元，菉豆交易寥寥。</p>
<h3>捲菸皂燭暴漲　當局派員澈查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來因受米便刺激，百物飛騰，捲烟市塲竟陷混亂狀態，尤以日用品之火柴肥皂，任意狂抬，影響民生至鉅。警務當局甚爲重視，業已派員進行密査，對非法捲於奸商將予嚴緝懲辦。警局經濟科昨傳捲烟·皂。燭業同業公會理事長翁滋有到局訊問。諉稱漲價係出品價高之故，經濟科方面當派員派翁所辦之店內査帳，如獲操縱抬價證據，將予懲辦。</p>
<p>捲菸市塲管理當局爲捲烟皂燭等物品大部份與國計民生攸關，特通吿會員自肅，其通告原文如下：「查本會同業經營之捲烟皂燭火柴等物品，大部份與國計民生攸關，凡各交換人不得在市塲內任意抬高市價或代客買賣，以增市民負担，曾經本會一再通吿嚴禁在案，茲査百物又見飛漲，政府當局在執行經濟緊急措施政策，嚴厲抑制，務希各交換人一體注意。免受輿論之指摘與法令之制裁，合行通吿一體遵照。</p>
<p>同時又爲整頓市塲，加强管理起見，對今後參加市塲交易之會員烟號，嚴限批發商號，其他一概不得入塲。並規定原有之批發商資本額至少一千萬元。如不足一千萬元者，必須在短期實行增資，無力增資者，即取消入塲交易資格。</p>
<h3>絲綢一致挫降</h3>
<p>連日銀根奇緊，昨市絲綢一致挫降。人造絲一二〇號高山有光一千七百萬元開盤，最大喊七百八十萬元，午收盤爲七百五十萬元，塲中一片卖出聲，成交可稱絕無僅有。下午仍喊上午收盤價，結果比上日短一百五十萬元。其他如金三馬東洋等均隨之而降，七五號半光昨亦喊小二百萬元</p>
<p>廠經昨市亦只有喊價而乏成交，E字等級討價一千九百萬元，尙無人過問。高檔另担做開一千九百五十萬元，干經另担討價一千五百萬元，各檔喊價比上日俱小六七十萬元至一百萬元不等。</p>
<p>綢貨亦因銀根關係，成交極稀，且實銷淸淡故廠盤大都低降。被面均小三四十萬元，大誠格子璧縐小二千元，華錦縐喊價一萬三千五百元，尙缺受主。羅紡每兩亦小五百至一千元。</p>
<h3>今起開始申請　糖商恢復配糖　昨日市價已見回跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕物價評議會第二次大會已定十五日召開。今日下午三時燃料小組先開預備會議。</p>
<p>食糖小組於昨日在社會局開會，決定台糖公司自今日起，恢復糖商之配糖。價格爲（一）特號砂白糖配售價每担卅五萬元，（原價廿九萬五千）。（二）一號棉白糖每担配售價卅三萬元，（原價廿七萬五千）。上項價格已經評議會主任委員吳開先與台糖公司總經理沈鎭南會商同意。今日上午十時至十二時。糖滴即可至台糖公司申請。九日向公司領取准購單，十日繳款，十三日起出貨。至直接用戶餅乾，糖果，罐頭食品，製藥，國藥，汽水及茶食各業之用糖，亦經決定根據去年八月三日之配量配給。</p>
<p>昨二四粗白爲三十五萬元，三半車白三十三萬元，故白糖一致回跌。秘魯細砂爲四十萬元至三十九萬五千元，降二萬許。二四組白降四萬元，二〇中砂降萬五千元，台赤降三萬餘元。土糖如提靑刁靑呌原價，均未成交。順德靑廿六萬元，小五千元。興化白四十萬〇五千元至三十九萬元，小五千元。興赤三十萬元至二十九元八千元，小五千元。</p>
<h3>薄嗶嘰軋缺</h3>
<p>草綠元藏灰素薄嗶嘰，邇來頗爲軋缺，喊價已多超過中厚以上。市貨流通祐乏異常，其價上漲之神速，得未曾有。藏靑中厚嗶嘰售價反在薄素嗶嘰之下，因美國貨存底充斥，現在熱天，實銷有限。白嗶嘰需供二寂，售價仍照例高於各種顏色之下。總窺邇日嗶嘰盛銷之顏色，不論厚薄，藏靑色爲最廣暢，灰色殿二，草綠居三，元色末後，價目方面，則以灰色較爲昂貴。申請廠商一一一七九家</p>
<h3>輸往華北紗布</h3>
<p>申請廠商三七九家</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會辦理紗布輸往河北東北各口岸申請審核登記事宜，本市廠商迄已有三七九家，前往由請登記。申請登記之期限，本市至本月十二日截止，外埠至本月廿六日截止。限期屆滿後，審核手續大致尙須一週，即可分發許可證云。</p>
<h3>烘青喊價再挺　新祁門成本不輕</h3>
<p>査徽烘·珠蘭·大方等各種內銷茶自天津帮胃納開朗後，交易步趨佳境，人心亦咸帶堅化。價格方面依然鞏固。惟卅五年徽州烘靑，市上存底業將吿罄，賣戶售意較緊，喊價再向前進，是以市氣獨吿上挺。洋莊茶市進購者賡續袖手旁觀，致過程虛浮如故。茲悉：刻下午昌。華茶等公司對於去年度平水大帮頗有復動之勢，惜出價異常　吝，每担僅爲卅四五萬左右，但貨因成本購係，談判難獲順利。</p>
<p>（又訊）在國際市塲佔有重要地位之祁門紅茶，邇來已屆產新之期。聞產區茶商正在積極佈置中，但今年因一切開支浩大，故貨方由毛茶製就菊茶，再加連滬之水脚等費，成本匪經。頃據業中人云，本市每担至少須售二百萬元，始能微博蠅利云。</p>
<h3>食油賡續下跌</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油市價，昨日賡續下跌，本廠荳油五十五萬至五十五萬五千地，跌四萬元，吉普桶生油五十八萬至五十九萬元，跌二萬元吉普桶荳油五十八萬元</p>
<p>據油業中人談：近來袖價連續騰漲，外埠到貨，油廠榨油，原不够本者，現均已有薄利可圖。昨日營口到貨頗多，荳油到價成本在五十萬元以內，放販賣商採辦轉殷。榨油原料，大連豆仍不廉，價屹立於十八萬五千元，惟芝蔴一項，如今後不再多供外銷，照目前油價，已敷榨油成本，可望油廠採用，榨油供銷云。</p>
<h3>食油調節會成立期未定</h3>
<p>榨油業公會理事長邱良榮昨語記者稱：當局爲供應滬市食油，籌組食油調節委員會，原擬於日內成立，惟以將來配售食油，所有虧賠，由政府負擔一點，中植油廠前曾擬定計算表，呈市府審核後再由中農行貸款進行收購。惟經吳市長考慮後，認謂今後食油如再波動，與配價間之差額，倘由政府每月貼補，爲數極鉅，亟須經當局核實施行，有關方面業已派員晋京，向中樞洽商，數日內當可決定云。</p>
<h3>黃白祥茂日光肥皂　新訂行盤公佈　黑市皂價回跌</h3>
<p>中國肥皂公司因鑒於燒碱禾本荊油等製皂原料在漲，致原定之各牌肥皂行盤，已不敷成本，茲爲維持成本出貨供應市需起見，將肥皂行盤重予調整，一二〇塊黃祥茂皂行盤改爲每箱二五萬元，一六〇塊白祥茂皂行盤改爲每箱三十二萬，二〇〇塊日光皂行盤改爲每箱三十八萬元，該公司自新盤調整後，即實行派貨，計每家經售員得派黄祥茂十箱，白祥茂十箱，日光皂四箱，共計二十四箱，此項派貨消息透露後黑市皂價即吿回疲。</p>

<h3>南京政治問題座談會　新政府的課題　集體意見</h3>
<p>若要政治進步，除了執政者本身的條件以外，還有一個條件，便是建立一種淸新有力的「政治淸議」一方面發出比絞健全的批評，隨時給全國人民一個準確的觀念。另一方面，也可以提供若十有價值的建議，作賓朋雜　案牘勞形者。一種參考。這裏是南京一部份有抱負有才略的中堅幹部的集合，按時以座談會的形式，縱論天下事。最近的一次是五月四日，假座南京黨公巷四號舉行的，參加者，爲毛松年，王述曾，王錫庚，仲肇湘，成惕軒，谷風翔，何曾源，吳興周，金紹先，陳曼若，曹翼遠，楊君勱，趙章輔，錢淸廉，羅萬類等三十餘人，以新政府的課題爲題，談話的綜合內容，簡誌如左：</p>
<p>所謂新政府，係指改組後之國民政府委員會及五院而言，然中央統治權之行使與夫衆人之事之管理，實萃集於行政一院，故舉世所矚目於新政府者爲行政院究將何所作爲，以突破當前之難關而開創今後之新途。此本前政府未完之課題，本質上不因民靑兩黨之參加而有異者也。</p>
<p>行政院長張羣四月二十三日之就任廣播詞，首標試行行政院責任制，繼謂今後八閱月爲由訓政至憲政之過渡階段，而政府之任務，則爲完成憲政之凖備工作，恢復國家統一安定及解決目前財政經濟問題等三大綱，全文盡爲原則式之指陳，從政者類能言之，即其五月一日在立法院之報吿詞，亦未脫此窠臼，若問實現此等原則之有效辦法爲何，則頗費吾人之尋繹推究矣。</p>
<p>張院長曾謂政府今後措施，必着重於根本之圖，凡無關於預算平衡，幣制整理等國計民生迫切重要事項，，絕不輕率行動，其意蓋除此兩端外，餘事皆當暫仍現狀，吾人尙論時政，毋寗認為赫奕之事功，必產生於平凡切實之中，政事雖分別部居，仍有其密切之關聯性，非謂其他庶政皆在停滯堕後狀態，而神功突降，預算及幣制獨可先登彼岸者也。今日新政府之課題首須健全政本，然後尋求績效，利器善事，必也體用雙參，庶乎有濟。</p>
<p>所謂健全政本，其事有六：正觀念，改作　重人才，簡機構，申法紀，課效率是也。新政府之執政者，除必須具備之官吏道德如勤廉公忠等外，尤須有準確之職務觀念。政府之性質雖爲過渡，然施政之動機，不可僅作過渡之打算。旣曰行政院責任制，則當認淸責任，勇於負責，官之去留，繫乎道之通塞，事之成效，不當一仍以往陋習，事事存一依賴主席之心。至於前進觀念，民主法治觀念，均當先立乎其大者，然後處盤根錯節之會，始能定而不惑。此其一。今後政治作風，張院長謂掌屛絕虛浮延宕惡習，樹立崇法務實風氣，此義無諍。然今日政府另有一慣技，一即鴕鳥政策，一切不合理之現象，明知其不合理而故作不見，但求藏頭，不知害身，豈可不痛下針砭？此其二。爲政需人，用人惟才，取才以方，故考試銓叙制度爲人事制度之重心，而執政者之心目中，則每以爲高級政務人才，考試銓叙中必無其人，亦決無於考試銓叙範圍中培植所需要人才之意圖。韓非謂良相必起於州部，猛將必發自卒伍，今日袞袞諸公，起家有術，類多側徑旁門，一步登天，鮮有積功累勞逐漸升遷而至者，以此而侈言人事制度，侈言公務員保障，其將誰欺？且今日國家給與公務員之待遇，已成社會憫憐譏笑之對象，吾人確信改善公務員生活，爲加强行政效率之必要條件，改善方法可依生活指數，定一基本額，超過之數，施行强迫儲蓄，政府旣可延緩支付，公務員亦不致減少收入。更確信於考試銓叙中陶冶人才爲健全政本之中心義諦，而在人事制度尙未眞正建立之現在，多黨政府，易流於分贓局面，亦應嚴防開此惡例。此其三。調整機構之議，年來屢起屢息，中央亦曾多次策劃，迄無所成。機關如機器然，應恰如其分，繁複龐大重疊及系統不明，適足以戕賊政事，妨害效能。今日中央以多設部會爲能事，部會以多設附屬機關爲能事，省市以多設廳處局爲能事，而各機關則槪以擴大編制，多設人員，提高官位爲能事。嘗見有某人少事簡財乏之邊省，民財敎建四慮之外，社會合作農林水利地政田糧衛生會計等局處，可設盡設。又嘗見資源委員會之組織法，簡任薦任委任三等人員之數額，各爲一百餘人又當見國防部之職務，已由各廳處局分掌無餘，竟又設置十司以重複之。又嘗見上海市政府之現行組織，有如中央行政機構之體制，此皆訴諸常識而可怪，按諸法律而不合者也。今後應使組織緊凑。名器鄭重，非經立法院制爲法案，不得妄立機關，妄定官位，妄訂預算，妄支經費，而現行以行政命令設置之機構，一律須經立法審議，各機關過秞之人員應由中央通盤籌劃，使之流向省縣，庶幾人才下移，基層健全。此其四。嚴申法紀，肅淸貪汚，應有積極消極二義：積極義在凡有措施，一以法爲準。官吏之所以不守法，以法律之外，旁徑錯出，法律以內，矛盾孔多，是以利己則揚法以自衛，害已則屈法以自私，或舍法而徇情，亦避法而作弊。應將現行法律作一總檢討，非法律之單行條規，作一總淸除，務使法律疏而不漏，簡而必行。消極義在盡量糾彈遠法及貪汚行爲。懲治貪汚旣法有事條，檢舉抉發，尤應雷厲風行，不稍徇瞻，官吏兼營商業，即爲利用權位封殖資產，特宜懸爲厲禁，且須作一普遍檢査，如有觸犯，即予斥革。上下包庇，故作痴　，非興國之象，此其五。今日政府無能，似已爲中外所一致詬病。實則有能與否，繫於執政當局之是否賢明，設能貫澈上述五端，益以簡化辦事程序，講求機關管理，則行政效率，不期自至，政府有能，無待鞭策。此其六。</p>
<p>政本旣强，然後進求績效，吾人亦願借箸代籌，聊貢一得。目前最急需尋求答案之問題，無過於如何打破目前財政經濟之難關。張院長就職十日，物價即呈現高速度之騰躍，此其反映及結果所屆，爲政府預普愈不平衡，通貨信用愈趨膨脹，生產事業愈入萎縮，商業投機愈形猖獗，經濟心理愈呈病態，人民生活愈不安定，長此以往，前途實不堪設想。張院長廣播詞語，治標方面，當繼續切實執行經濟緊急措施方案，治本方面，當逐步實施旣定方案，其含義似嫌不甚明晰。然張氏前後會數次提及改革幣制或整理幣制，此點實甚重要。吾人認爲改善財政，穩定經濟，整理金融，應各方齊進，奇正並用。吾人確知改善軍事經理爲减少國家財政支出之必要條件，改善稽征剔除中飽爲增加國家財政收入之必要條件，增加農工業生產爲穩定經濟之必要條件，剷除官僚及投機資本爲平抑物價之必要條件，改革幣制爲整理金融恢復信用之必要條件，尤以改革幣制，爲一切條件之先決條件。戰後通貨膨脹，幣制崩壞，本爲各國通常情形，然第一次世界大戰後，各國先謀穩定經濟而後整理幣制，此次戰後一反程序，皆先整理幣制而後謀穩定經濟，蓋其收效較速也。我國現時應即改革幣制，以政府　有之外匯及黄金，並將美國五億元之生產貸款改爲金融貸款，作為發行新幣之準備金，當可足用。此爲國運民命所繫，新政府之成敗功罪所關，執政者盍起圖之。</p>
<p>次一急要問題，爲迅速完成國內之安定統一，政府爲對付中共之全面軍事行動，不得已而採取有效軍事措施，吾人與張院長同其希望，此一適切而有效之措施，能迅速達成統一目的。然無限期之戰鬥，則非今日內外情勢所能堪。吾人主張，前方將士待遇應予提高，軍需械彈供應應予充裕，而綏靖期限則必須尅定，綏靖戰果尤必須嚴課。昔人云，將軍死綏，咫步無却，願望避敵，逕撓有刑。今日自須嚴申軍令，執行軍法。李義山所謂「軍令未聞誅馬　，捷書衹是報孫　」，絕對不可復見於今日。至於綏靖區內，軍事與政治應互相配合，不應偏實一方，綏靖區爲政府與中共自思想文化以至社會制度鬥爭最烈之地，現行政院綏靖區政務委員業已撤銷，然綏靖區之政務，則決不可等閒視之。綏靖區之政治，應繼軍事收復之後，速謀安定秩序，教濟民生，使地方能保能養，而軍事方面，尤須以相當武力與時間，掩護政治上之開展，庶幾隨地即是長城，足以抵禦共黨之流竄，而有助於綏靖時間之縮短。</p>
<p>最次，爲一般政治問題，實施憲政之準備工作，現僅待立法委員監察委員及國民大會代表之遷舉矣。國父孫中山先生之遺規，原藉考試救選舉之窮，今此制已阻格不行，自將完全付諸政黨之競選活動。然選舉如何使之嚴肅，眞正熱心國事與政治能力甚强之人，如何可以當選，人口必須調査淸楚，選權必令親自行使，豪劣必須力加裁抑，賢良必須優予薦揚，希望政府善爲運用，政黨各自省察，母裂凟此神聖之制度。又如各省軍民分治，載在和平建國綱領與國民政府施政方針，雖爲政客之政治資本，然稽諸往史，揆之事實，量其得失，實爲新政府極應奉行之良政，而所謂分治者，應解釋爲文人主持省政，非謂各省軍人主席因已退役，遂謂已與分治之旨相合也。至於敎育，實爲民主政治最有力之保障，苟欲爲民主政治建築百世不搖之基礎，雖方事之股，新政府亦應具大抱負，立大志願，爲普及國民敎育，盡其餘力也。</p>
<h3>陝省參議會三次會速寫</h3>
<p>— 四月三十日西安航訊　本報駐陝記者李馳</p>
<p>陜西省參議會第一屆第三次大會，本月十四日開幕，當時預定會期半月，到今天本應閉幕，而事實上，昨天才聽取完了省府各單位首長的施政報吿，和有關的質詢與建議。這段議程如此延長，正表示出參議員似對施政者有許多貢默與無數希望。閉幕日期恐怕還得在好幾天之後。</p>
<p>減輕負担一致要求</p>
<p>時間是最無情的考騐，從二次會到今回三次會的七個月間，陝西老百姓的生活，果然好轉了麽？——這問題的回答，我們不妨引證一位參議員在頭一天的提議：請檢討上次大會議決案，到底有若干付之實施，行之有效！　是的，十幾天來，我們在會塲中聽到許多動人的未來建設計劃，甚至建議者本人亦不知何時可以實現的美麓「藍圖」。所遣憾的都多少被參議員們訴說人民前當血淚話遮蓋着了！七十五歲老參議員羅世安老淚縱横的說：我由陜南鎭坪來西安開會，城裏老鄉們邊哭邊送的送我出城，要我向本會呼籲救濟，減輕担負。坪鎭人太可憐了！」减輕担負，正是陜西老百姓的一致要求。</p>
<p>會場呼聲要求廉潔</p>
<p>每天在會塲裏眞不知道要聽到多少次這句慣用成語：「老百姓　得辦——法嘛！」於是乎年前第一次參議會提過陝南窮得大姑娘沒褲子穿這椿事，而昨天會裏舊事重提的依然說他們沒褲子，就不甚動人聽聞了！</p>
<p>駭人聽聞的有受檢舉的不法會汚，和歷舉數字說明人民的負担，重到什麽程度。參議員要求廢潔守法的「父母官」。</p>
<p>赤字預算彌補有方</p>
<p>縣級赤字預算「捐獻」來彌補，說穿了還不是「攤派」的別稱？小至如人口不過三萬的麟遊縣，抗戰中抽過三千多名壯本，今年赤字預算六億元中，已實行攤派的有一億元，另縣級公糧六千多石。耀縣在未全部收復前，人口不過四萬，壯丁不及一萬，但負担築碉堡和修石子路的賠累，就有廿多億元。再加上各種臨時供應，每家每年動輒要拿出數百萬！朝邑縣人民化在買壯丁的錢，每月就化三億元。韓城人口九萬，負担的草料，運輸隊驟馬，騾夫及車子，民夫，牲畜損傷等項賠累之有數字可核者，已達三十餘億元。</p>
<p>糧政問題提新建議</p>
<p>糧政的毛病似乎特別多，本來預定三個錄頭即可完結的這一段議程，不能不延長到兩個整天。前後提出質問的參議員多達三十餘位，幾及全體出席者的半數。</p>
<p>針對着當前時弊，參議員仍　出如下要求：糧政人員要淸白，要選任好人，要嚴究中飽。此外還先後通過了四項臨時動議：（一）田賦徵實之超收公糧，撥還地方；（二）電請財糧兩部免除陜省田賦附加百分之五十；（三）電請政院自卅六年度起，停止田賦徵實，軍糧徵購，按實物折徵法幣；（四）電請中央停止在陜徼購軍糧。</p>
<p>爲了扶助和救濟農村，當局在合作事業，農貸，和水利建設各方面，做過好些事情。但來自民間的參議員仍對之都不大滿意，並認爲有若干地方已變了質。農貸，一部份因發放過遲，「遠水不救近火」；另一部份貸款流八高利貸手中，反而嫁禍農村。水利建設雖然有相當的實効，增加農產不少，但水費自從改徵實物後，農民的負担也同時加重。</p>
<p>當前教育三大問題</p>
<p>回頭看敎育。師資，學風，經費，正是當前三大問題。例如「保」設立的「保學」，校長就是目不識丁的保長，試問敎育如何能辦得好？洋縣上月底兩中學比賽籃球，互起衝突，毆傷十六七人，死三人，省立七中的校舍全部焚毁，洋縣省中被搗一空。難道這就是今日應有的「學風」麼？說經費：國民學校有些欠薪，達數月至半年，某高中每月辦公費僅有兩萬，自然談不到敎師待遇如何如何了。</p>
<h3>蔣主席在濟南</h3>
<p>— 濟南四日航訊　何冰如</p>
<p>國民政府蔣主席，於五月三日，由南京飛抵濟南視察，已於五月四日返回南京，蔣主席於魯中萊來蕪吐絲口戰役之後，曾一次蒞臨濟南視察，當時因爲需要秘密的關係，所以濟南市的報紙全未獲透露消息，但是京滬平津，以及其他處所的報紙，還是一樣登出來，因爲一個國家元首的行動，無論如何是不容易守着秘密的，蔣主席這一次到濟南，正是五三紀念日，及五四紀念日，當民國十七年的今天，蔣主席正是北伐軍總司令，統率大軍到達濟南，因爲日寇出兵阻止北伐軍北上發生五三慘案，蔣主席被環境所迫，到了濟南不得停留，即退住党家莊，雖然以後繞道北伐，終於完成了革命統一工作，但是五三慘案的國恥，永留在中國人每一個人的心間，現在擊敗日寇，勝利後的今日，又適當國軍軍事轉入勝利，蔣主席甫到濟南，當然有相當的感慨，也有其歷史上的意義，七十萬市民於蔣主席勝利後來濟南的二次獲得瞻仰國家元首的機會，更是說不出的興奮，和盼望，原因是國家已勝利了，而山東仍是砲火連天，人民在水深火熱之中，大家熱烈的擁護蔣主席，亦盼望早日底定軍事，使地方秩序恢復，人民獲得安居樂業。</p>
<p>到濟　五月三日是一個半陰不晴的日子，大家正祈禱甘霖的時候，約在下午三時半左右，空中用南面飛來了兩架巨型的飛機，他載來了國家元首蔣主席，合他的隨員們，這時候第二綏靖區司令官兼省政府主席王耀武將軍，省黨部主任委員龐鏡塘先生等幾位高級官長，已早到機塲恭迎，首先着地的是美齡機，二六〇號軍用機也隨着落下來，這兩架飛機載來的全是國家的當代人物，除了蔣主席與他次公子蔣緯國外，其他同來的是國防部參謀總長陳誠，國民政府軍務局長兪濟時，及國防部劉維章廳長等，並高級隨員等二十餘人，蔣主席及陳總長是戎裝下機後笑容滿面，當即分乘第二綏靖區預備的汽車，到市內綏靖區司令部休息，這時候市民們只知道戒嚴，還不知道誰來，有說是陳參謀總長，有說是顧祝同司令，但是一班的推測，令知道蔣主席來了，否則用不到如此謹愼戒備，蔣主席重臨濟南的任務，雖然他說是慰勞大家，但是人人知道他關心地方軍事及政治，並更關心地方人民，他當然要問問地方情形，有所指示。</p>
<p>視察　蔣主席到了濟南以後，除向黨政軍首長詢問地方情形以外”並且輕裝減從到省政府省黨部視察，三日晚八點半蔣主席帶侍衛數人，乘車赴城內省政府，到了省政府正是下班的時間，沒有什麼廳長委員在內，只有總務處喬處長在省府以內，這時候王兼主席耀武也隨後趕到省政府，蔣主席在主席辦公室少坐了片刻，便又到西花園視察，旋又往省黨部視察，蔣主席還以爲省黨部在城內，問明了才知道在商埠，這時候省‘’黨部已得了消息，主任委員龐鏡塘，書記長楊鵬飛，及各委員們已經齊集會客室內恭候，蔣主席下車步入會客室，即在南面皮椅上坐了，與大家談起話來，主席首先說大家很辛苦了，我這次來是慰問各位的，現在軍事已進入勝利階段了，大家要繼續努力，旋詢問地方情形，各位委員答覆了一切，設明地方人民困苦情形，請予以救濟，蔣主席聽取了意見並未久坐，便回了第二綏靖區。</p>
<p>訓話　五月四日蔣主席在綏靖區司令部召集黨政軍團及民意機關人員訓話，首先說明這一次來濟南是爲了慰勞大家，現在軍事上已步入勝利的階段，最重要的兩個區域，一個是延安，共軍的主力已大半解決了，一個便是山東，現在沂蒙山區，國軍也獲得勝利，殲滅共軍甚衆，泰安之一時放棄不必爲意，相信收回已在不遠，綏靖區的工作不能全靠軍事，還須黨政團及人民共同協力，盼大家要繼續努力，早使地方秩序恢復，人民安居樂業云云。</p>
<p>歡送　當五月四日的清晨蔣主席到濟南及即回南京的消息已經傳遍市面，同時全市懸掛國旗，並到處萬國旗横過街市，當空飄揚，市民們萬人空巷，恭候歡送地首，並瞻仰豐彩，也不過兩個小時的時問自綏靖區至飛機塲沿途市民不邀而集，達十餘萬人，熱烈情况確是空前未有，十點，蔣主席陳總長一行的人們分乘汽車由綏靖區司令部赴飛機塲，沿途市民跳躍歡呼萬歲之聲，高呼入雲，眞是稀有的盛大和熱烈，可以看到人民對蔣主席愛護與擁戴，當蔣主席乘車到了市郊的時候，他並停車下來看了看防守保衛濟南的工事，因爲他對於濟南人民的安全是十分關心的，停留了約三分鐘，仍然上車前進，十時半到了飛機塲，這時候山東的黨政軍團各機關並各界首長全到了飛機塲列隊歡送，並且山東田各界代表推裴鳴宇呂子人吳錫九周幹庭何冰如楊寳琳張達忱何修甫于樂亭趙明遠等向蔣主席恭獻錦旗一面，上書「民族救星」四字，由吳錫九周幹庭兩位老先生持着旗恭獻，由蔣主席親自接受，蔣主席陳總長並且向歡送的人們寒喧一遍，滿心喜悅的上了美齡號飛機，於十一點正破空飛去，並且在濟南市空繞飛一週，表示他對於濟南市民的感謝，恭送的大家也分別回到市內。</p>

<p>百物飛漲影響房租編輯先生：</p>
<p>我親戚是一個低級公務人員，每月的收入，不過是五十多萬元，在目今生活費用昂高的時期，一家人的生活顯然是相當的貧困，米及日用品漫無止境的高上，眞呌人奈何，可是爲了各物的暴漲，我們的二房東先生又異想天開的，在下月的房租金上漲了二倍，他有他的理由，說是大房東有漲房金的提議，二房東因此亦漲了，對，不過大房東所漲的極徵，而二房東却漲了二倍，增加它幾倍的房金利潤，何况我們的房金也曾在三月以前漲了一次三倍的房租金，而今又漲了，我曉得這是請你搬塲的變相，你搬走了，他才能跟人家談金條，我想在這樣經濟動盪激烈之下，同樣的情形，將不止我親戚一家，希望社會當局對這種風氣，從速確定一效的制裁。（康助）</p>

<h3>紙荒與文荒</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>近來大家都鬧着買不到米，米荒引得在家心慌。可是大家沒有覺得紙荒的嚴重，二十萬一令的紙還不容易買到·這要下去恐怕秋季的教科書要發生問題，整個出版界難以生存。前經濟部長王雲五先生說過英國至今還在管制出版，我國更應如此。所以一方面應該管制洋紙的進口，一方面該鼓勵土紙的生產。土紙的生產並沒有鼓勵起來，洋紙確實限制進口了。以致造成了今日的紙荒。中國外匯的消耗捲烟是必需品呢？還是紙張是必需品？我們真不忍看見國家變到寗願捲烟風行全國而不顧文化破產的這個局面。所以我們再三的希望政府放寬紙張的進口，開放書籍的進口，以挽救紙荒的危局。</p>
<p>王前部長也說過黃色刋物不應如此流行，這又使我們想到中國非但有紙荒而且有文荒，正當的刋物雖然也有，但還不如黃色刋物的風行。上海有些黃色刋物因爲要求得銷路不惜涉及淫穢。市社會局有一度曾經取締過這些刋物，後來又逐漸的出版，但其內容之惡劣，較之過去尤甚，不知道社會局方面對於這類刋物至今是否仍然注意？這種情形使人覺到中國文化水準太低，興趣太低，這種文荒危局尤甚於紙荒。</p>
<p>一般而言，大家見米荒而不見紙荒，見紙荒而不見文荒·但就是整個民族的前途而論，文荒的危險重於紙荒；紙荒的危險重於米荒。</p>
<h3>評「清代名人傅略」</h3>
<p>— 黃維廉</p>
<p>書名：Eminent　Chinese　of　the　Ching　Period.</p>
<p>編著者：Arthur　W.Humnel</p>
<p>出版者：Washington　D.Ｃ.Ｕ.Ｓ.Ａ　Government　Printing　Office</p>
<p>出版年：第一冊一九四三年第二冊一九四四年</p>
<p>溯自十九世紀末，中國四書五經之有英譯本（James　Legges　Chinese　Classics）以來，這兩本新出版的英文「清代名人傅略」，可說是一部溝通中西文化的一大巨著。其文筆之雅，收羅之當，記載之詳，以及參考之廣，勝過任何一種表揚文化的獨立工作；亦可說是近五十年來，對於西方學者研究中國文化書中的偉大著述。</p>
<p>本書純爲一種宣揚中國歷史，而仿傅記；然亦不能因其體裁之異同，而减少其書的重要及價值。法國啓明運動的大著作家伏爾德（Voltaire），當謂歷史是偉的的表演，任何人不否認偉人的生平與事業，是一種時代的反鏡；因此，在這兩本書內所述的八百多人的傅記中，可見到無數的歷史睥表演與事蹟，例如明末的崩裂，及清初的隆盛等等的一切重要記載，及相關的事實。故此書實可供給種種歷史上的綫索，俾使西方學者，對於東方學識，可得到更深切的認識。</p>
<p>國會圖書館　八九年工作</p>
<p>凡是偉大的計劃，固不能於短時期間內實現，亦不是一人所能勝任的；這部書的編製，足足費了八九年無數人的心機，又是代表中日美三國五十餘學者，在華府國會圖書館內的亞洲部下的分工合作者結晶品。但其最大的貢獻是屬於房君兆穎夫婦兩人，他們倆竟寫成了全數八百餘　中的半數。房君的工作，非但佔了數量的偏重，又是盡了物質的優勝，凡是最重要的人物的記載，上自帝皇公卿大臣，下至博學宏懦與一代的詩人，皆出於房君之手；又因爲他的國學根底之深，他的記載如類炎武，載震，及紀　之尖，更是超人一等；他在這部書內指出了無數碩學的偉人與時代的進退，及他們對於當代學術的影響，和中國文化的趨勢。</p>
<p>比之吾國固有的歷史巨著，如「清史稿」之類，「列傅」及別種著名的傅記，這部書的記載方法，可說是進步得多；這是因爲本書的編製，利用了許多地方誌與年譜的資料，及中外人士所編的近代著作；例如一代的逆臣，或是反對政治的，或是反對學術的，向爲正史所不取，今皆收入。再如明末忠臣的事蹟，如朱國楨戴名世等，滿清的逆臣如吳三桂，洪秀全筀產，革命巨子如譯嗣同與康有爲之輩，或爲一時代的特出學者如崔述等等，都記載詳明，又因爲他們利用了無數的秘密本與個人稿件，更採用了向所目爲不正道的資料，致這類偉大的歷史人物，這到了本書中的相當地位。</p>
<p>參考資料浩瀚　譯名上期準確</p>
<p>本書內所收的傅記資料，其範圍又屬浩瀚，而確有參考價值，例如個人的家庭北景等等；且於文學，亦有相當的進步；餘如譯名的準確，生卒日期的可靠，與文筆的一致，都值得抬高全書的價值；其索引的編製，如人名索引，書名索引，與類目索引，更爲精　，每人的傳記之末，更附以個人的書目；為種編製工夫，確增加了全書的參考價值，且切近實用，可謂圖書館參考的一種重要工具。</p>
<p>雖然，這部書的偉大公認的，但亦有他的不能避免的短處，譬如關於材料的選擇，所選的都是大臣，名將，及宿儒之屬，關於文學，藝術，科學及宗教方面的人物，亦佔了想當地位；但關於別種職業方面的領袖人物，竟絕鮮提及，例如商賈方面，如廣州之行商，在十九世紀中，於中外交通史中佔有相當勢力，但祇有少數人的傅記入選。餘如山西之銀行界曁監商，與當代的經濟和政治的活動，頗有關係，但亦未選入。再如近代史學趨勢所重視的時代的社會經濟狀況，亦頗多忽視；因之，吾國的社會與經濟的歷史，成爲研究中國學術史中的蒙蔽角落，且亦優勝劣汰能於此書中大放光明。</p>
<p>人物選定　不無遺漏</p>
<p>關於個別傳記的選擇，亦不免有相當的遣　，例如明代人物如李成梁，　茲，湯顯祖等，及明末清初的人物，其生平大半事業在明代者，如阮大　，范景文，左良玉等，旣有選入，則清末民初的顯著人物，其大半事業在清代者，如盛宴懷，康有爲，梁啓超輩，似不應落選；又如清初之中日外交史中的南明人物，亦應選入。諸如此類，尤其是關於文藝方面的遺漏，不勝枚舉。但關於　炎武，崔述的記載，至爲詳盡，而於孫奇逢的記載，則不能指出他最重要的工作，是在宣揚王守的學說，且同時亦影響了清代的學術；再如明末功臣史可法，逆臣李自成，張獻忠的記載，亦沒有得到相當的敘述；關於鄭成功的記載，亦僅記其在沿海的抗戰事實，而不載其在臺灣的功蹟，亦未失當；換言之，個別傅　記的記載，及所佔的地位，不能相稱而平均；有者失之冗長，有者失之簡略，餘如全書中引用的中文書名僅有譯音之譯名，而未加以英文意譯之名稱，致西國學者使用不使，未免一大缺點。便統觀全書的價值，其佳點脫下過弱點，似有不可厚非之明證；此書於西文中之關於中國史進，可說是得到強有力的地從頭再來　，亦可說是加強了溝通中西文化的一新　綫。</p>
<p>平反舊爭論　發現新證據</p>
<p>胡適在本書的序內說：本書爲近三百年來的一部傅記字典，其包羅之廣，計劃之大，以及用處之事，任何一種已出版的字典，可與之此擬。可見其取材之當，選擇之當，統譯之精，令人欽佩，吾國原有之傳記資料，凡屬兩黨兩派之爭論，向不可自由記載，近今之學者廣收秘本，發現新證券，糾正以往之傅記體裁，將原有之禁書盡量發刋，向日之這禁人物，逐漸表揚，對於改革中國之守舊傅記文體頗有裨益。</p>
<p>綜觀昔日之中國傅記文學，其缺點在不能記載與外國相關的人物，例如十七世紀初之中國傅教徒，又如一八三九至一八四一年之中英戰事中的有關人物，再如太平天國之人物等等的記載，都不能利用外國的資料。本書的編製，可利用國外所藏的中國資料，可謂對於改革中國傳記資料之性質的五貢獻。此書可作爲中國近三百的來的歷史讀，亦可作爲一種中國史料的泉源觀。</p>
<h3>神秘的大衛</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>——我最愛的一本書</p>
<p>小時候，我曾因亞米契斯的「愛的教育」而流眼淚，然而「神秘的大衛」却是一本更好更美的書，動人的故事，動人的筆調，動的情感……即使所有的形容字眼全搬出來，我也無法能多不服水土我喜歡這本書的心情於萬一。</p>
<p>「神秘的大衛」，原名GuitDavid，坡爾特EilenorH.Porter著。敘述一個音樂家的故事，也是教育講座。</p>
<p>大衛在四歲那年失去了母親，他的父親在悲痛之餘，一心一意要好好教育這唯一的孩子，於是，他帶他住在山上的家，那高高的山腰的空地上屹立着孤零零的一所茅屋裏，父子寂寞的度過了六年，六年當中，父親教他的兒子拉琴，諱，念法文和拉丁，認識人生和宇宙的美，大衛十歲了，具有極大的指揮和卓越的音樂天才，却缺乏一切世俗上的普遍嘗試，甚至金塊的用途也不懂，對於他一切疾病，苦痛，死亡都是沒有意義的名詞。－總之，大衛在最真最善最美的崇高教育中長大，他的靈魂裏充滿了良善，美麗，光明的思想。但是在現實的世界裏，他是個小孩子。</p>
<p>當那個父親病得非常厲害，自知快要離開人間的時候，他開始懷疑，自己給孩子的訓練是否是有益的？</p>
<p>父親覺得自己命在旦夕了，忍著病痛，負了行囊，帶著大衛離開了山上的家，他要將他的兒子送到現實的世界裏去。不幸在半途，力不能支的父親丟了行囊，死在一個名呌何西門的農人的牛棚底下了，在那六月天的屯個有月亮的晚上，可憐的大衛天真的拉着琴送他的父親到另一個國度裏去。兩封莫明其妙的信，兩隻梵珂林，一代金塊，是他父親留下的遺產。</p>
<p>何西門不甚情願的留下這孩子，大衛開始了他的厄運，每天，他得爲何西門作許多他不會作也不願作的事情，堆木柴啦，洗刷碗碟啦，拔草啦，割榖啦，當然，大衛是旣不能勝任，又不會愉快的，何西門十分討厭他，全村的人都說這個流浪孩子，不知受的什麼異教。</p>
<p>大衛感到惆悵了，小小的心裏第一次惆悵，想起父親他努力拉着琴，在空閒的時候。</p>
<p>就是那和諧美妙的琴音，合得大衛漸漸的被人愛了，他的朋友一天比一天的多了起來，一個盲小孩，一個患肺病的大學生，以及他的妹妹，還有那個美麗富有却是長年憂愁的小組，全都得着大衛的安慰。</p>
<p>人們漸漸的歡喜他了，這出奇的，動人情感的好孩子。</p>
<p>大衛忘不了他的音樂世界。有一次，他計劃要用那些金塊到音樂血糖裏去求學，好能夠拉得更好的琴、－但是，但是不幸的事情來了，何南門存錢的銀行倒閉了債主要向他們來找麻煩，正在焦急的時候，大衛眼裏露出一綫光，將他所有的金塊給了這一雙牛衣對泣的夫婦，這寄食流浪小孩，替他們解了圍。從此，大衛在何南門家的地位與先前不同了。</p>
<p>大衛不能再夢想他的美麗的世界－音樂前程，但是他仍然拉著琴，爲他的琴音所感動，失和的父子重歸於好，　開了的情人破鏡重圓，　　成美，恨變成愛，病弱變成健康，不美麗的世界也美麗起來了。</p>
<p>歸後，何西門的愛音樂的兒子看到了大衛的父親的遺書，發現死者乃是舉世聞名的大音樂家，大提琴家，於是這孤陋寡聞的鄉村的人們全都震驚起來了，何西門不能私留這孩子，因爲外面有他成千萬的朋友，名譽，地們，聽衆，金錢在等待着他！大衛屬於這美麗的世界了！但是他此後每年還要携一次琴回到這孤寂的小村裏來，拉琴給這一對年老的夫婦聽。</p>
<p>故事就這樣完結，平淡，十分的平淡，滑驚天動地的大犧牲的英烈行爲，但是却有許多愛，也沁有曲折離奇的緊張情節，但是刻刻扣住人的心弦，動人情，　人眼淚。</p>
<p>計完這一冊司，引起人的渴望，渴望真能看到有一個像大衛這樣的孩子，並不一定會拉琴，或是像他一樣秀美有智慧，但必須良善，天真，無知得將強盜拐子也看作聖徒，有清白慈善的心腸……</p>
<p>但是，失望得很，總覺得大多數孩子太聰明了些，其實也許是，大多數的父母太愚蠢了些。我們只要看，那個音樂家給大衛的教育和訓練，他自己雖曾懷疑過不智，事實上他却是大大成功的。大衛縱然也因爲那奇特的教育受過一點疑難，但是這世界本身還是美麗，即使不美麗也會變成美麗，爲捨棄賢明的父母不讓他的孩子們受到一些良好的美麗的訓練和教育呢？</p>
<p>當物每逢看到有些孩子老練得像大人，世故得較他自己的實得他們太苦了，像悲傷一個未老先衰的中的人一樣，代爲惋惜他們失去的天真；同時我又想起了神秘的大衛。</p>
<h3>張大千撫燉煌壁畫</h3>
<p>— 周從</p>
<p>（大風堂彩色版）</p>
<p>（上海漢口路宣和印社經售）</p>
<p>本集共十二幅畫均爲均爲唐代的人物畫。結構謹嚴賦色石艶筆墨俱佳。第二幅夜又所用的組織條，影響現今西洋畫的野獸派與蘇聯之木刻很大，第三幅藻井爲極工整的裝飾圖案，第八幅母女供養像，描寫兩個妓女捨賤從良，點已可證明明唐時的染色技術進步的程度。每十幅托西大王曹議金像，碧眼黃髮，　授朱袍，與十一幅其夫人李氏之翠翹金雀，粉黛　環，都可見到當時人物畫的技巧高妙，正如我們讀白香山的新　府，對唐代女子的奇異裝飾一覽無餘。至於像上之題鋁，又無異看唐人寫經，那更是意外的收穫了！</p>
<h3>方重未之間</h3>
<p>— 東淵</p>
<p>于潮茅盾等著·小雅出版社印行</p>
<p>中國的新文化運動，現正處在「方生未死之間」，其意義之所在，誠然是由於我們過去的新文化運動「幾乎是沒有批判地接受了一切的外來思想，而又是那麼觀念模糊，莫衷一是。」因而造成今日這種狀態。</p>
<p>在這本書裏面，正告訴讀者處此方生未死之間，新文化所應循的途徑，序文中它明確地指出：不再是「一味地抹殺抨擊，而是批判地接受文化遺傳」，從而可以建立「堅實的文化陣容，完整的思想體系。」爲我們的文化運動收穫那　　的鮮果。</p>
<p>歷史的進展不但是在不斷加深人的認識，而且是在不斷擴大人的心胸，八年偉大的民族戰爭，所人從愚昧狀態中漸知自拔，覺醒，生活的鍜　，是最能使人啓示前進的，在這本　面的文章，我敢肯定的說：這全是經過了鍜　的精髓之作。</p>
<p>序文中有這麼一段美麗的言詞：「　原野上怒吼的狂風做我們的教師，讓飄然無心白雲做我們的教師，讓籠罩庭花的多情夜月做我們的教師……」加以於現在，是血淋淋的現實做我們的教師，正因爲「生活是一首偉大的史詩，它雄偉，它也柔媚；它如鏗鏘，亦如幽泉瀉　。」我們該向它學習！</p>
<p>這一冊書裏，是由于潮·項黎·嘉梨·茅盾四位先生合寫的，書名即糧據于潮的一篇「方生未死之間」爲題，于潮先的這篇文章裏，它述出：</p>
<p>人們的麻木·疲倦·消沉·觀望度，幾支配過往的廿五年間，當然這不是會社會的全景，而是代表一個角落，作者就這一點出發，敘述出廿五年間由國新支化始末，雖很簡而覺明確。</p>
<p>項黎的「感性生活與理性生活」，嘉梨的「生活的三度」，是對生活一個很好的啓導，茅盾先生就從他們身上，寫下了「論所謂「生活的三度」」一，對生活提出了很好的態度和應走的道路。</p>
<p>此外，于潮的「論生活態度與現實主義」，項黎的「論藝術態度和生活態度」，對生活更有具體的指示。</p>
<p>我們要向生活學習——尤其是文化工作者，這些文章是不可不讀的。</p>
<p>誠如于潮先生所說：「我們正是處在方生和未死之間：舊傳統的遺毒還沒有死去，新文化還沒有普遍地生根；我們的任務很簡單，呌未死的快死，呌方生的快生。……」</p>
<p>這是今日文化界的明徑，必然地，我們應走上這條路！</p>

<h3>杭市米潮打風有感</h3>
<p>— 逸</p>
<p>杭州的民風，素來是很剛勁的；故外縣人　之曰：「杭鐵頭了上年三月，再度重現，雖說是在「法治」下所不應該有的事情，但那正好表現了杭州人的那股「剛勁」之氣</p>
<p>據說此次事件的起因，是：杭州市民偵知了省田糧處副處長和杭市米業公會理事長合夥囤米，以致十二萬七千元一石的官米，無從購得，黑市米漲到二十六萬元一石，升斗小民，無以爲生，終於在柿市下城慶春街，　集了平民千餘人，展開「打風」！</p>
<p>我不知道市政府平日對於市區食糧是否有個統計，每天需要幾多石？是不是「打風」發生之前，已經知曉了全市米店不售官價米？更是不是平日把「配米」的報告嚴密審查？我相信市政當局一定對於上項三個問題，必是日常核行的；那末，核行的人，也應該負起這次「事件」的一大半責任。</p>
<p>平民肇事，都是激於一時義憤，決非權謀已久，陰圖變亂；而事後市政當局宜如何安撫人心，公佈辦法，更宜如何補草救濟，廣施仁心？今而欲「戒嚴」以資鎮　，其「柔以克剛」，希從政於杭市者借鑒之。</p>
<h3>新聞綱</h3>
<p>— 鐵雲</p>
<p>搶米之風是到荒年才有的。但是今年搶米風潮却受了物價波動的影響。杭州·上海·無錫·成都·都是展開了搶米潮。如若物價是物價未能穩定，米價如再跳出卅萬大關，社會秩序是令人憂慮的。</p>
<p>新聞記者寫社會新聞時，必定自身先　一個大前提，他對讀者的暗示，心理上必須健康，故意把一件普通的影響太大：同時對於一件事情的看法與態度，也是失之公正的。</p>
<p>賢明的社會新聞執筆者，以爲如何？</p>
<p>有人說宗教是政治的兄弟，他能幫助政治家統治他的王國。以世界各國宗教力量之巨大，以及宗教家勸人「安分守已」，就是一句最富有政治意味的口號。</p>
<p>最近上海映過一張「聖女之歌」，有人罵得它「體無完膚」，原因是這影片否定了科學，極力倡導「神說」的靈騐。</p>
<p>而最近羅馬教堂裏，據說耶穌神像的「創口」，居然流出「鮮血」，於是轟動了信徒，前往膜拜。</p>
<p>雖然那教堂的神父曾經很合理的解釋，所謂鮮血，其實只是耶穌創口所繪油彩受光綫反射而已，并不是什麼鮮血，但是「信徒」們，却置之不理。</p>
<p>受了八年敵僞薰陶的人，也懂得在日常生活上，弄弄政治手腕了。比如爲了一點私人間的仇恨，也會向治安當局告一狀，替他「仇家」戴上一頂「帽子」，這風　，戰前上海到還沒有聽見達，現在我們也看到了。</p>
<p>上海人的精神，也是在走向下坡了。</p>
<p>人粗在使用雷達，原子能，而我們這些人，却在高談「宿命論」，這是如何地可怕呵！</p>
<p>日本人有軌律，有計劃的在　展各種建設·貿易，他們的產品，將隨着「山姆叔叔」之後，遠征全世界，中國自然也是其之一，但中國人民，却在忙些什麼呢？</p>
<p>天韻樓攤販張李靜英，因聞當局　解無結果，竟致發　。</p>
<p>其實這年頭，誰不是有點瘋瘋癲癲？</p>

<h3>商業競爭</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>兩個猶太人對街各開一　店，拼命作生意上的競爭。除了大減價之外，還想出種種方法來打倒對方，連晚上睡覺的時候也盤算着惡毒的主意。某日夜裏有一個猶太人仙人走到其中一個的床邊，對他說「你要什麼就可以有什麼。可是你有了什麼，你的同行將得到一倍。」</p>
<p>「有這樣的事麼？」這猶太人說，「那沒有問題，我要瞎掉一隻眼。」</p>
<p>影譚</p>
<h3>「新天方夜谭」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>在戲院裏忍耐地挨過了九十分鐘，才勉強的把「新天方夜譚」看完了，走出戲院，不覺爲這批製片家們感到悲哀，亦爲那幾千尺膠片感到惋惜。</p>
<p>國產電影經廿幾年來的掙扎奮鬥，由「火燒」「武俠」的故事進步到現實的題材，這是時代的力量，也是那些求長進的電影從業員的努力收穫，想不到在勝利的今天，竟還有人來攝製這種無聊的影片，實在不能不爲國產電影痛心。</p>
<p>從任何方面來講，也找不出理由要攝製像「新天方夜譚」這樣一部影片，放眼看去，可取的題材太多了，而「大中華」却不惜浪費人力財力來攝製這部不知所云的片子，除了說明該公司製片路綫的氏誤外，那只有解釋爲企圖賺錢，不擇任何手段的一種可恥的行爲。</p>
<p>這個故事上從「天方夜譚」中抄襲來的，編劇者把它弄得牛頭不對馬嘴，真是莫名其妙，劇情的進展全人生觀劇作者擺佈，人物在這裏沒有思想，個性，生活，像木人頭戲中的傀儡，劇本的主題企圖表現些什麼？恐怕連劇作者都沒有弄清楚，你說如何教觀衆能明白。因此一向鑽在「唯美」裏的「藝術導演」但杜字，企圖以色情塲面來賣弄，滿足小市民的慾望，但是現在可憐他連這一點賣弄也失敗了，這部片子裏的「肉感」「色情」塲面，比起好萊塢的大腿片子來簡直是小巫見大巫，至於那些飛毯飛繩，及大開打塲面，更是讓觀衆們感到滑稽與可笑。也許有人以爲但杜字導演的片子，至少在攝影·書面·光綫·角度上不會太差的，那末這部片子同樣給你一個大大的失望，由此想到一個跟不上時代的藝術工作者的命運是可悲的。</p>

<h3>罪犯請示割腦</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>聯合社有一個匹茲堡的電訊，說有慣於竊盜的罪犯賴德，積案累累，最近請准法庭，自願接受前腦解剖實騐。在手術中由某博士開刀，將前腦自其餘部分分離。現在此人業已精神煥發，健啖如常。至於他是否能從此棄邪歸正，尙等今後的行爲來證明。</p>
<p>按割沼頭腦，早年即有，可是由罪犯自己請求，却是一個創舉。據三月份的生活畫報說，此種手術，雖然猶在試騐時期，却已經有百分之六十的圓滿效果。該罪犯之願意接受割治，充分表示他內心本有一種棄暗投明的傾向，不幸平日此種傾向，却不能阻止他偷雞摸狗的行爲，正如史蒂文孫的著名小說「傑克爾波斯與赫埃德先生」（即化身博士）裏面的主角一般，雖有爲善的心，却不能使自己不做惡事，他一定曾經求助於自己的良心，可是捫心自問，從增自愧，却仍舊不能使他從此不爲非做歹，從賴德以無期徒刑之身而請求割腦的情形來看，可知他對於自己絕未失望。他雖是一個罪犯，却可以作爲亞當後　的代表。我們人類雖然已經惡貫滿盈，可是我們向善的一顆良心，並未死去。我們未來的希望就在這個地方。</p>
<p>有人說過我們這個世界所以如此紛擾，祇因社會科學的進步遠落在自然科學的後在。看了割治腦袋的新聞，我們覺得要救這個世界，似乎還有待於科學。從來爭執不已的人性善惡問題，從此應該得到答案了。我們應該確信人人都有一個善良的靈魂，使他爲惡的是那從來無辦法的皮囊。人的天賦各有不同，祇是不同於他們的肉體，並非不同於他們的靈魂。從這個立塲來看，我們的左親右鄰，處世態度也應該有一些改變了吧。這不是說我們要縱容那些作惡的人，而是說我們要將他們當作我們一樣的人看，將他們改變過來。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>熊處長正在聽電話。</p>
<p>被激怒得忘了一切一句的老祝毫不客氣的走下去，搶下他手裏的話筒。</p>
<p>「熊處長，你答應讓我們明天走，可是我的手續到現在也沒有辦好！因爲你們的余科長要講公事！」他高聲地說，完全像質問。</p>
<p>對方的臉也漲紅了，顯得很不滿意他的無禮。</p>
<p>「起初他要我請示你批，承你幫忙，已經批過了！　是他又要我另辦公事，再加名單，我也依着他一起辦好，　了！可是，最後，他又說我這公函上沒有關防，不能交代！公事！公事！全中國那麼許多人天天在辦公事，才辦到今天這麼一天！這樣的公事要辦下去，中國非亡不可！」他簡直不讓對方開口的機會，一下就發洩了個痛快。「現在請你再說一句，你讓不讓我們走？讓就乾脆關照我們什麼時候，什麼地方上車！不讓，我姓祝的立刻就走！」</p>
<p>少的長熊處長原已給他挺撞得快不能忍耐了，可是聽着他說的給余科長再三留難的經過，再瞧着他那兩條例激得在劇烈地顫抖的手臂，也不由激發了少許人類原有的　　　。</p>
<p>「別生氣！別生氣！」他結　來　　老祝的周膀，像撫慰一個孩子似的說：「公事歸公事，明兒　讓你們走，我送你上車好不好？」（六六）</p>

<h3>Yu Hung-chun Reports on Financial Work: Stabilizing Currency Value, Controlling Budget; Legal Tender Issuance Approximately Six Trillion Yuan</h3>

(2) Regarding the selection of members for the Qualification Review Committee of the National Political Council, it was resolved that Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen, Ji Yiqiao, Mo Dehui, and Wang Yunwu, totaling nine individuals, would serve as review committee members, with Sun Ke as the convener. (3) Legislative member Luo Youren has been absent from the Yuan for a long time and unable to return to office, so he should be dismissed. The vacancy should be filled by Ji Jinmei, the resolution was passed. (4) Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan proposed the general budget for the 36th year of the Republic for Shandong and other twelve provinces and cities, the resolution was passed. (5) More than 20 other financial budget proposals were all resolved to be passed. Furthermore, State Affairs meetings will be changed to Fridays starting from the next meeting.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th] The National Government Committee also discussed the price issue, unanimously agreeing to lift the freeze on the cost of living index from January and instructed relevant departments to draft new economic measures.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan presented a report on the principles of the government's stabilization of the national economy at the second session of the State Affairs meeting on the 7th. He reviewed the emergency economic measures plan, believing that certain points should be strengthened and certain points should be revised.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun reported on finance at the State Affairs meeting on the morning of the 7th. Mr. Yu stated: The central task of the Ministry of Finance at present is how to bring budget revenues and expenditures closer to balance. Therefore, all financial measures aim to increase revenue. In terms of policy implementation, one is to strengthen the tax system, one is to cooperate with economic policies to promote production development; one is to regulate finance to seek currency stability; and one is to control the budget to reduce unnecessary expenditures. At the same time, it will further utilize public debt material policies to absorb social idle funds and utilize international surplus economic power and enemy property sales prices to supplement revenue. Subsequently, he made a brief review of the implementation of the national general budget for this year. The original budget listed revenue at more than 730 billion yuan and expenditure at more than 930 billion yuan, but because since the beginning of the year, peaceful unification has not been realized, transportation has been obstructed, and production has stagnated, the economic undertakings on which finance relies have been greatly affected, and it is even more difficult for the national treasury's revenue and expenditure to adapt. From January to April, it was the off-season for tax collection, and the reports from various provinces have not yet arrived. According to the numbers from the treasury, its revenue is approximately more than 200 billion yuan, while expenditure is approximately more than 500 billion yuan. It is estimated that more than 1.2 trillion yuan will still need to be spent in the eight months from May to the end of the year, and the total amount spent will be approximately 1.8 trillion yuan. If we generously add a reserve fund of 200 billion yuan, the total expenditure will be 2 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>The National Treasury Has Large Amounts of Gold and Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, in addition to the reorganization of tax revenues, revenue can exceed the total budget by 300 billion yuan, totaling 1 trillion yuan. The US dollar bonds and treasury bills currently issued can yield 480 billion yuan, and the sale price of surplus materials and the acceptance of enemy and puppet property are expected to increase revenue by more than 200 billion yuan due to the revised foreign exchange rate. Therefore, it is hoped that revenue can reach 1.7 trillion yuan, and the deficit is being addressed by seeking sound financial resources for compensation. Mr. Yu further pointed out that recently, the outside world has been speculating wildly about the number of issuances. In fact, as of the end of April, there were only more than 600 billion yuan. The national treasury has large amounts of foreign exchange and gold, so preparations are exceptionally sufficient.</p>
<h3>Office Expenses for Various Agencies: Approved Increase Ratios; Subsidies for Twelve Provinces and Cities Total Over One Hundred Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The approved increase ratios for office expenses of various agencies are as follows: (1) Regular expenses will be increased by two to two and a half times the original amount. (2) Special office expenses will be increased by two times the current payment standard, effective from May. All prepaid funds will be integrated into the additional budgets of various agencies, and business agencies should allocate them within the originally approved business changes. (3) Special office expenses for civil servants will be increased by three times, calculated as 300,000 yuan for the presidents of the Five Yuans, 270,000 yuan for the vice presidents, members of the government committee, chief secretaries, provincial chairmen, and political committee members, and 240,000 yuan for legislative and supervisory members. Furthermore, the total amount of subsidies for public utilities and coal is more than 361 billion yuan, of which the Shanghai municipality's share for May is 6,687,583,000 yuan. Furthermore, the total budget for the 36th year of the Republic for Hebei, Fujian, Gansu, Guizhou, Kangding, Shaanxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Beijing, Qingdao, and Chongqing, totaling twelve provinces and cities, has a total estimated revenue of more than 126.4 billion yuan and a total expenditure of more than 219.9 billion yuan, with government subsidies exceeding 13.4 billion yuan. This case was passed by the State Affairs meeting on the 7th. In addition, an additional expenditure of US$85,041.40 and National currency 113,140,000 yuan was added for the delegation stationed in Japan.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Measures for doubling the principal of pre-war deposits have been jointly drafted by the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Offices and have been submitted to the Executive Yuan a few days ago and will be announced shortly.

This is the issue of our military police entering Lüda simultaneously with the receiving personnel. Foreign Vice Minister Ye Gongchao emphasized this point when answering reporters' questions at a press conference held at 4:00 PM on the 7th. Ye stated that the Soviet Ambassador's response, submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, should not be made public according to usual diplomatic practice before the negotiations are completed. However, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Soviet side on April 17th, outlining the procedures we intended to take for receiving Lüda and how to proceed with the reception, as well as matters related to the joint management of the China Changchun Railway in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The note also mentioned sending an inspection group to Lüda before the reception, which the Soviet side has agreed to. However, a mutually satisfactory method has not yet been reached regarding the simultaneous entry of our military police into Lüda. The inspection group will depart in the near future, and the members include Dong Yanping, Zhang Jianfei, and others. Regarding whether journalists can accompany the inspection group, Ye stated that the government welcomes journalists to accompany and report in principle, but no newspapers have yet submitted requests to the government. The government is considering whether they can accompany the inspection group. Furthermore, regarding the issue of our military police entering Lüda, the main point of contention lies in the interpretation of the clause in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance related to the stationing of troops in Lüda. The clause roughly states that the Soviet side considers the defense zone of the Lüshun naval base (including Dalian) during wartime should still be regarded as wartime until the Sino-Japanese peace treaty is concluded. Our side, however, believes that the war has long since ended, and the Japanese military threat no longer exists, so it cannot still be regarded as wartime. Based on the Soviet side's view, our troops not only cannot enter Lüshun and Dalian, but also cannot be stationed there.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 7th] Ye Gongchao stated at a press conference today that the Sino-French air transport agreement will expire on June 30th of this year, and the Chinese government is giving favorable consideration to the revisions and extensions proposed by France. (Note: The original Sino-French air agreement stipulated that aircraft from China and France would fly between Shanghai and Saigon once a week, starting from January 1st of this year, for a term of six months. New negotiations began after the Chinese government notified its termination of the agreement on March 31st.)</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Government Information Office of the Executive Yuan held a press conference at 4:30 PM today. Director-General Dong Xian Guang answered inquiries as follows:</p>
<p>Question: It is rumored that Li Huang of the Youth Party does not wish to assume the post of Minister of Economic Affairs. Is this true, and what is the reason for Li's hesitation? When will Zuo Shunsheng begin his work as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry?</p>

<p>Question: The government's administrative guidelines stipulate that the councils of provinces, cities, and counties should be participated in by various parties as much as possible. What preparatory steps are being taken for this, and are consultations underway? If so, what is the nature of the consultations, and is there an agreement on the scope of participation of various parties? If there is an agreement, what is its content?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the issue of various parties participating in local councils, the leaders of the various parties are conducting step-by-step discussions, and no concrete agreement has been reached yet.</p>

Are there any actual plans to transfer personnel in each province to implement the separation of military and civilian administration as soon as possible?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is gradually implementing the policy of separating military and civilian administration in each province. The recent appointment of Mr. Wei Daoming as Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government is one example. Question: Since the publication of the administrative guidelines agreed upon by the various parties, what steps have been taken to implement the provision to "strictly guarantee" the various freedoms of the people?</p>

<p>Question: What was the purpose of Chairman Chiang's trip to Jinan last week?</p>
<p>Answer: Chairman Chiang's trip to Jinan last week was to understand the local situation. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the Chairman has visited many cities such as Shanghai, Beiping, Shenyang, and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Question: Has the government decided on a method for adjusting the salaries of public school teachers and staff? Will the cost-of-living index be unfrozen soon?</p>
<p>Answer: The government has decided in principle to improve the salaries of public school teachers and staff nationwide, and a precise and appropriate method will be decided in the shortest possible time. The cost-of-living index may also change accordingly.</p>
<p>Measures to stabilize the economy have been formulated in detail</p>

<p>Answer: Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan reported this morning during the State Council meeting, explaining the government's principles for stabilizing the national economy. As for implementation methods, given the vastness of our country and the complexity of economic issues, including prices, the government will formulate specific countermeasures according to the environment and its needs, in order to achieve stability. Illegal transactions in the black market for U.S. dollars have been ordered to be secretly investigated by the competent authorities, and those who are caught will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Question: Can you provide an update on the progress of transferring state-owned enterprises (such as the China Textile Corporation) to private operation?</p>
<p>Answer: Relevant ministries and commissions are discussing concrete measures based on the resolutions of the National Economic Commission.</p>
<p>The military situation in Shanxi is not as serious as reported</p>
<p>Question: What is the military situation? Is the government satisfied with the recent military developments in Shandong? How serious is the recent pressure exerted by the Communist army on Shanxi?</p>
<p>Answer: After regaining control of Tai'an at 11:30 AM yesterday, the National Army in southern Shandong has joined forces with the National Army in the Jinan area. The remnants of the Communist army are fleeing to the mountainous areas north and east of Tai'an. The situation of the Communist army in Shandong is very embarrassing because after losing the strongholds of Mount Tai and Mount Culai in southern Shandong, they can no longer gain a foothold in Shandong. Moreover, most of their troops are local militias and conscripts, who do not want to leave their hometowns, so they cannot all withdraw from Shandong, which puts them in a dilemma. The military situation in Shanxi is not as serious as reported by some newspapers. The main forces of both sides have not yet made contact. There are only about 10,000 Communist troops in northern Shanxi, and only 10,000 to 20,000 Communist troops on the Zhengtai Railway line.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Instructions on Fluctuations in Grain Prices; Strict Prohibition of Hoarding and Manipulation to Harm the People; Four Measures Stipulated for Provinces to Follow</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 7th] After the grain shortages occurred in various places, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the provincial chairman, instructing four measures to be followed immediately. The telegram stated: Grain is indispensable for the people's food, and there must be no hoarding, manipulation, or profiteering to harm the people. In recent times, grain prices in various places have fluctuated greatly, which is extremely harmful to people's livelihoods. Now, four measures are stipulated: (1) All legitimate grain merchants engaged in the purchase and sale of grain should be protected and facilitated by administrative authorities at all levels. Grain merchants who have not been registered and approved shall not hoard grain. (2) Loans and advances approved by banks shall also be limited to legitimate grain merchants who have been registered and approved. For amounts of 100 shi or more of grain, the Grain Department must be notified at any time. For amounts of 200 shi or more, approval must first be obtained from the Ministry of Food. No bank shall privately purchase or store grain. (3) Legitimate grain merchants shall sell and supply grain to the market at any time after purchasing and transporting it, and shall not hoard it or deliberately raise prices. (4) The circulation between rural and urban areas shall be absolutely free, and no local party, government, military organizations, or people's organizations shall obstruct it. If it is necessary to restrict the outflow of grain in cities where the government has designated price controls, the local grain administration authorities shall handle it according to the orders of the Ministry of Food, and no other agencies shall interfere beyond their authority.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Hangzhou People's Food Purchase and Sales Committee and the People's Food Adjustment Committee jointly resolved: "Abolish negotiated prices and allow free buying and selling, but the grain industry and shop guilds must prepare a cost calculation table and submit it to the Price Review Committee for review." The proposed door-to-door selling price is 280,000 yuan per shi for white glutinous rice and 250,000 yuan per shi for steamed glutinous white rice, which has been submitted for approval, but the market still has no quotations.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Hangzhou agencies organized a rice shop investigation team after the disturbances. According to the investigation, 7,195 shi and 3 dou of tax grain were robbed, and 2,377 shi and 5 dou were sold at Kang prices to cope with the emergency situation. According to grain merchants, 136 grain shops in the city were destroyed, and 4,491 shi of rice were lost (urban area), so the city's losses were enormous.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Rice Shops Recalling Resuming Business; Suzhou Market Stops Free Trading</h3>
<p>[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 7th] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Kesu attached great importance to the rice rush that occurred in Wuxi, in addition to sending important officials to Wuxi to carefully handle it, he also telegraphed the post-disaster policy day and night. Now, the rice industry in Wuxi has returned to normal starting on the 7th. At the same time, the provincial government, based on the instructions from the central government, telegraphed the remaining counties to discuss and determine grain prices according to the market situation, encourage grain merchants to purchase from producing areas, transport them themselves, supply the retail market as much as possible, and strictly prevent grain shortages. The rumor that this province prohibits the transportation of rice to Shanghai is absolutely incorrect.</p>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 7th] Today, the rice industry sells rice to each person with a limit of one dou, priced at 180,000 yuan per shi, only one type of rice is available, in order to maintain the people's food supply. In the afternoon, the county chamber of commerce held an emergency meeting and decided: (1) Collect the total number of robberies from various street numbers, describe the process in detail, and submit it to the Executive Yuan, the provincial government, and the county government for relief. (2) Request the government to allocate the balance of the tax grain from Wuxi to alleviate the people's food shortage. (3) Request the provincial government to strengthen police forces, strengthen security, and ensure that such unfortunate incidents do not happen again. (4) Request the command to severely punish the rice robbery offenders. The provincial government also telegraphed the county to instruct and guide grain merchants to sell their grain reserves, maintain the people's food supply, not hoard and raise prices, and strive to reduce the burden on ordinary people. The chamber of commerce and the food industry should purchase from surplus grain areas in other provinces to increase reserves and pay close attention to avoiding rice shortages.</p>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 7th] The Suzhou rice market stopped free trading on the 7th. The county government stipulated that each grain shop must sell 500 dan per day, and the price was set at 220,000 yuan. However, for other merchants to purchase, they must first obtain a purchase certificate from the grain association and then collect it from the designated rice shop, with a limit of five shi at a time. The rice merchants did not follow the above measures, so the market turnover was very low. Grain merchants are now preparing to request a higher negotiated price, but it is heard that the county government has reached an agreement with the Wujiang grain association to supply the needs of the Suzhou market, so people's hearts have improved.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 7th] Grain prices here continue to rise, and each dan has been sold for 180,000 yuan (an increase of 40,000 yuan). In order to curb the rising prices, in addition to prohibiting external transportation, it is also stipulated that grain merchants shall not transport grain.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi Discusses Prices and Living; "A Monthly Salary of Only 30-odd U.S. Dollars, It's Conceivable How to Maintain a Living"</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] Hu Shi talked freely with reporters today about the issue of prices and living. He said, "With prices rising so sharply, not to mention professors, even I, as the president of the university, have no way to deal with it." When the reporter asked how to overcome this difficulty, Mr. Hu said, "Friends in the bank know that I am poor, so they helped me. I value credit, so I will have to pay it back eventually." Speaking of the distance between salary and prices, he said, "When I came to Peking University, I earned 280,000 yuan per month, which was about 100 U.S. dollars. The second time it was adjusted to more than 500,000 yuan, which was still about 100 U.S. dollars. But recently, although I have increased it to more than one million, it only amounts to more than 30 U.S. dollars. I earn 1.2 U.S. dollars a day, which is only 30 or 40 cents an hour. It's conceivable how to maintain a living." He also jokingly said, "I might as well teach in the United States." The whole day Ting interjected from the side and said, "President Hu originally planned to teach in the United States and use the remaining money to subsidize teaching, but now it has already exceeded that amount." But when it comes to the issue of how to curb inflation, Mr. Hu still does not want to express his opinion.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Allocates 3 Billion Yuan to Relieve Housing Shortages in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>[Our City News] UNRRA decided yesterday to allocate 3 billion yuan specifically for relieving housing shortages in Zhejiang Province. According to Branch Director Sun Xiaolou, Zhejiang Province suffered heavy casualties in housing during the war, especially in Xiaoli, Anji, Xiaoshan, Fuyang, Changyu, Wuyu, Haining, Haiyan, and Tonglu, etc. He has been repeatedly requested by local people in Zhejiang to come to Shanghai to appeal to the headquarters, requesting a special fund to build people's houses in order to relieve tens of thousands of people who have nowhere to live. A considerable result has now been obtained. It is estimated that the construction cost of a people's house is about 300,000 yuan, and the total allocation of 3 billion yuan from the headquarters can build about 10,000 houses. As for the regional allocation of people's housing construction, it will be submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Post-War Relief and Review Committee for decision after returning to Zhejiang tomorrow. Sun also said that UNRRA has also decided to establish an agricultural machinery manufacturing factory in Zhejiang Province (the above-mentioned factories have been established in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Shenyang, and Liuzhou). UNRRA will allocate 160 tons of machines and tools, worth about 2 billion yuan, and 300 tons of raw materials, worth about 1 billion yuan. In addition, 1 billion yuan will be invested by four banks and two bureaus, and 1 billion yuan will be invested by local gentry, with a total capital of 5 billion yuan, in order to improve existing agricultural machinery and increase production.</p>
<h3>Shandong Actively Repairs Yellow River Embankment; Mobilizing 1 Million Laborers; Decided to Proceed in Two Phases; Officially Commencing Work the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th] The Yellow River embankment reconstruction project in Shandong Province will mobilize 1 million laborers and require 2 million cubic meters of earth. The Shandong Embankment Repair Office decided to proceed in two phases before the flood season, officially commencing work on the 10th and completing it before July 15th. Kong Lingrong, director of the office, held a meeting with county chiefs of counties near Heze in Heze on the 6th to discuss issues such as hiring laborers and purchasing materials. It is heard that the difficult areas for construction are currently in the 80-kilometer section from Juye to Dongping, because there are still small groups of Communist troops harassing and disrupting, and at the same time, because the river surface is only 100 meters wide, it is easily attacked by Communist troops on the north bank. Fortunately, 70 to 80 percent of the levees near Jinan, for more than 100 kilometers, have already been completed. The Hebei Embankment Repair Office is scheduled to complete the levees within a month. The situation on the north bank of Hebei is the same as that on the north bank of Henan Province, that is, the Embankment Repair Office has not been able to take over due to the war.</p>
<h3>Cleveland Arriving Today</h3>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Wanlong Raise 1 Million Guilders; Plan to Colonize the Xisha Islands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Wanlong, 7th] It is learned that some overseas Chinese here are now initiating a plan to raise 1 million guilders to colonize the Xisha Islands. Related personnel told reporters that the initiators of this plan, in view of the bleak economic future in Indonesia, hope that the Chinese government will seriously consider the colonization of certain areas of the Xisha Islands and give priority to overseas Chinese. A number of doctors, engineers, and economists support this plan, and it is believed that after the government grants special privileges, overseas Chinese in other cities will also support it. Currently, 5,000 overseas Chinese in Wanlong have expressed their willingness to go to the Xisha Islands, and the refugees in Tangkilong can also engage in fishing and agriculture in the Xisha Islands. The people who initiated this plan have already raised 10,000 guilders.</p>

<h3>Our Consul General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, Arrives in Nanjing to Report on His Work</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th) Yuan Zijian, the Consul General in Hanoi, returned to the country a few days ago to report on his work and has arrived in Nanjing. In recent days, he has met with Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Vice Minister Liu Shishun, and Vice Minister Ye Gongchao to report on the recent situation in Vietnam. Yuan said to reporters on the 7th: "After several negotiations between February 18th and 23rd, the Vietnamese army in the overseas Chinese district of Hanoi was finally allowed to withdraw. Prior to this, the French and Vietnamese armies confronted each other on three sides of the district, and there were frequent conflicts. Since then, it has been possible to avoid some almost inevitable loss of life and property." Yuan continued: "Hanoi has lost its old appearance after being destroyed by the war. There are now only 37,000 residents, including 15,000 overseas Chinese. Haiphong, once an important commercial port, now has only 45,000 people, according to official announcements. The railway between Haiphong and Hanoi has long been destroyed. Most of the overseas Chinese in Haiphong and Hanoi are engaged in business, and they have suffered heavy losses directly and indirectly due to the war. The restoration of the Bac Bo region in the future still depends on the early realization of a ceasefire between France and Vietnam."</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of negotiating compensation for losses suffered by overseas Chinese with the French side, Yuan said: The French side has agreed to pay 2,000 Vietnamese dong first, and a detailed compensation plan will be jointly handled by specially established organizations from both China and France.</p>
<p>In addition, Consul General Yuan expressed great concern about the detention of a reporter from the Central News Agency by British and Indian military police in Saigon. Yuan is scheduled to go to Shanghai to see a doctor within a few days and will return to Vietnam within a month.</p>

<h3>Wang Yitang, Traitor, Retried on Hospital Bed in Beiping Prison; No Longer Keeps Silent, Does His Best to Defend Himself</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] The Hebei High Court retried Wang Yitang, traitor, in the First Prison at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Wang's spirit was very good, no longer keeping silent, but avoiding answering questions that were unfavorable to him. The trial lasted for three hours. Wang, lying on the hospital bed, recounted that he was invited by Chairman Chiang in the 22nd and 23rd years of the Republic (1933 and 1934) to go to Lushan and West Lake to discuss the return of the Northeast, and in the 23rd year (1934) he went to Japan to mediate with Takahashi Korekiyo and Inukai Tsuyoshi, but returned without result and wrote a travelogue of his journey to the east. Wang had frequent interactions with the Japanese throughout his life. After the July 7th Incident, Wang Kemin invited him to participate in the Provisional Government, serving in various puppet positions until he resigned in January of the 32nd year (1943). The court accused him of repeatedly launching security enhancement movements during his tenure in the puppet government, and that the measures such as signing a declaration of war against Britain and the United States with Wang Jingwei were arranged by Wang Jingwei and the Japanese and handed over to him for execution. He stammered in response. Until 5:00 PM, the court announced the end of the hearing and ordered him to sign. Wang refused, saying that he would sign only after seeing the record of his confession. Although Wang's voice was low, he did his best to defend himself. Wang said that he would submit a defense within a week.</p>
<h3>Allied Nations' Appraisal of Japanese Looted Property; Soviet Union Refuses to Participate; Eight-Nation Delegation Begins Touring Investigation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Kyoto, 7th] The Soviet Union has temporarily refused to participate in the eight-nation tour investigation delegation that has arrived in Japan to identify Allied property previously looted by Japan in various Japanese warehouses.</p>
<p>The Soviet delegation in Tokyo refused to send a representative to attend the touring investigation team at the last minute. The team is scheduled to quickly identify the looted property within a year. It is learned that the Soviet delegation notified the Allied Supreme Commander that the Soviet Union was "unable to prepare" to participate in this arduous task, but did not elaborate on its reasons. High-level reliable sources expressed the view that the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the touring investigation team would delay the resolution of the issue. Representatives from Australia, Canada, China, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the United States have joined the team, which is headed by Brigadier General Don C. Faith, Director of the Civilian Property Custody Division of the Allied Supreme Commander.</p>
<p>The team inspected a museum on the 7th, which houses more than 210 items, most of which are works of art stolen from China. After the inspection, the Chinese representative hoped that the items would be transported back to China and legally preserved so that the owners could claim them for return.</p>
<p>The Allied Supreme Commander will directly order the Japanese to announce the items they transported from Japanese-occupied areas on May 28.</p>
<p>The purpose of the tour is to enable foreign compensation and for more identification representatives to personally identify the property looted by the Japanese government during the war. It is learned that if the requests of various countries do not conflict, they may be able to request the return of and list the items in the number. At the same time, the deadline for submitting requests will also be determined.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-examining the Issue of Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai market, stock prices plummeted to the daily limit, and general commodity prices also showed a downward trend, which, according to Mr. Fu, was due to tight credit. This shows that the frantic surge in commodity prices over the past month was probably not unrelated to credit expansion. However, we cannot be too optimistic about yesterday's market situation and simply wait for prices to fall step by step. The issue of commodity prices still needs special attention.</p>
<p>Suppressing commodity prices is a universal demand of the people and a consistent policy of the government. Since the victory, the government has made many efforts and adopted various measures, but the result has been a continuous rise in prices, at most only temporarily alleviating them at certain times. This shows that the countermeasures adopted in the past or at present, even if they are not ineffective or misdirected, are poorly implemented and fail to achieve the desired goals. Let us now re-examine them separately to help learn from past mistakes and prevent future ones.</p>
<p>First, Price Ceilings, Price Consultations, and Price Discussions. At the beginning of the victory, the city already had an organization for commodity price evaluation. Later, it was repeatedly reorganized, and things like rice, sugar, fuel, cloth, and cooking oil all went through a considerable period of experimentation. In all fairness, it cannot be said that it did not achieve some degree of mitigation. Since the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, this method of "price consultation" has been formally and universally adopted. However, the black market has become increasingly rampant, and prices have risen even further. Many price consultations have long been a mere formality, like announcing the new moon with a slaughtered sheep. Recently, the price ceiling on rice was finally officially lifted, and free trade was restored. This painful experience, rather than being a failure of price ceilings and price consultations themselves, is more accurately attributed to the fact that the handling was not proper, leading to the opposite result. The reasons are threefold: (1) The price consultation lost its timeliness and failed to adjust at any time, resulting in the creation of an open black market; (2) The set prices were too unreasonable, and many merchants believed that after selling, they would not be able to replenish their stock or resume production, leading to the bad habit of outwardly complying but inwardly disobeying; (3) It was focused on one area and failed to establish close links with relevant regions, resulting in the phenomenon of the reverse flow of goods or prices exceeding those in the production area. If these shortcomings could have been carefully planned in advance and carefully remedied afterward, they would not have been irrecoverable.</p>
<p>Second, Crackdowns on Hoarding and Manipulation. This is a necessary means for price stabilization and also the most diligent manifestation of the authorities' efforts. Unfortunately, the black market is too prevalent, hoarding is too rampant, and the general merchants and people are too uncooperative, leading to the phenomenon of collusion between officials and merchants, and unsuccessful penalties. Moreover, the crackdown on hoarding and cornering is subject to various necessary procedures under the law, which are stipulated in great detail in the measures for cracking down on hoarding and cornering of daily necessities during emergencies. At present, legal profits have not been clearly stipulated in most cases, and there are no regulations regarding the prices, locations, and times for selling the hoarded goods. Local officials should not be prepared to sell or buy them on their behalf. Furthermore, the hoarded goods and the sales volume are not registered, reported, or inspected with the trade associations and the competent authorities. What kind of transactions are legal? What conditions constitute hoarding? Most people are still confused. Everyone is just doing what they want and coping with the situation as they please, seeking to get by for the moment. Therefore, some legitimate businesses, although feeling the hardship of being constrained from both sides, are unable to cope with the difficulties, while the real hoarders and unscrupulous merchants are all slipping through the cracks of the law, doing their utmost to manipulate and raise prices. We believe that this responsibility should be shared by all parties.</p>
<p>Third, Releasing Commodities to Lower Prices. This is the most practical way to suppress commodity prices. Unfortunately, it seems that the procedural issues of the steps of releasing the commodities, the targets of the release, as well as the prior review and subsequent inspection, etc., were not well prepared and failed to fully meet the ideal, resulting in a great sacrifice for the public, while the goal of stabilizing prices remains far away. It only allows many speculators to muddy the waters and gain unexpected benefits. Judging from the facts of releasing gold, rayon, cloth, rice, and sugar, our words are probably not an overstatement! Some people believe that the public release of goods often follows the black market, inevitably leading to price increases, which is fundamentally inconsistent with the purpose of suppressing commodity prices. In fact, if the released materials are allowed to flow into the black market without any investigation, then the general users and consumers will never get the real benefits of lower prices. In other words, commodity prices will never come down because the benefits from lower prices have been exploited by many third parties and have nothing to do with consumers!</p>
<p>Fourth, Tightening Credit. Tightening credit means recalling floating capital, which also eases the degree of currency expansion. Theoretically, it can indeed achieve the effect of suppressing commodity prices. In the past, there have been many practical examples that can be cited. The problem is that before the national revenue and expenditure are balanced, the so-called recall of floating capital is only temporary in nature. That is, while recalling floating capital, it is still inevitable to release funds, which does not have much effect on the overall currency problem. However, between one release and one withdrawal, there is inevitably a wave of artificial fluctuations in commodity prices, and production is particularly threatened by high interest rates. From the point of view of commodity prices, this method cannot be said to be completely successful.</p>
<p>Fifth, Restricting Outbound Shipments. Prohibiting outbound shipments such as rice and flour, and restricting outbound shipments such as cloth, etc., are all aimed at maintaining reserves to avoid scarcity and high prices. The intention is undoubtedly justifiable. However, this is also a temporary expedient and should not be regarded as a principle. The reason is that Shanghai is originally a major port for transit, and its important function is in circulation. When circulation is restricted, it will hinder production. Last year, the flour industry once experienced overproduction and requested the lifting of the ban. After the cloth was banned from being transported to the south, it soon changed to limited exports. These are all obvious examples. Moreover, under rampant smuggling, how effective this restriction is is actually a question. Furthermore, if Shanghai can restrict the export of cloth and flour, why can't other provinces follow suit and restrict the export of food, dividing China into many "small" borders, which will only further stimulate commodity prices.</p>
<p>The above methods have not only been implemented in the past but are still being used now. However, general commodity prices are rising higher and higher, which is exactly the opposite of the authorities' policy of stabilizing prices. It can be seen that from the customs of today, to the customs of the present, to hope that commodity prices can gradually fall from now on, I am afraid it is too extravagant!</p>
<p>Of course, to suppress high commodity prices, it is impossible to solve the problem by simply lamenting and complaining. We believe that, locally, we should not hesitate to spend effort and cost to distribute daily necessities to consumers according to the population, so as to avoid them flowing into the black market. From a global perspective, in addition to eliminating redundancy and balancing the budget on the one hand, and supporting production and increasing supply on the other, there is no other way to follow. If you are greedy for simplicity, avoid reasonable and legal procedures, and engage in "incomplete control" in every detail, the result will only create a black market and fuel speculation! Furthermore, as a result of incomplete control, abandoning night patrols and hindering legitimate production will be tantamount to suicide!</p>

<h3>The French Socialist Party Congress Voted to Support Ramadier's Continued Governance and Passed Nine New Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The Central Committee of the French Socialist Party held an all-night meeting last night, which did not end until 2:20 a.m. this morning. By a vote of 2,529 to 2,125, it was decided to support the retention of the government led by party leader Ramadier. Prior to this, Ramadier stated in his speech, "If the Central Committee orders me to do so, I will submit my resignation to President Auriol tomorrow. But I must state that if I sign the resignation, I will feel that I am signing the abdication of the Republic." Ramadier also warned that causing a change of cabinet in the current situation would endanger monetary and economic matters, and should be prevented. Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet opposed Ramadier and repeatedly demanded the government's resignation, but former Prime Minister Blum supported Ramadier.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 7th] The National Committee of the Socialist Party, at 3:20 a.m. Paris time this morning, by a vote of 2,529 to 2,125, decided to support Prime Minister Ramadier's request to allow the coalition cabinet without Communist Party members to continue in office. According to the resolution of the previous Socialist Party Congress that the Socialist Party could only participate in governments with Communist Party members, today's resolution is a new development in the political history of France after the war. From today onwards, the French government will govern in the face of opposition from the Communist Party and the unions controlled by the Communist Party. Before the vote, there was a 12-hour heated debate. Ramadier and Blum both urged the Congress to support the continued governance of the Socialist Party. After the passage of the Socialist Party's continued governance, the Congress unanimously passed a resolution on the policy guidelines for Socialist Party members in the cabinet in the future. The main points are as follows: (1) Pay attention to the Communist Party's refusal to agree to the policy of suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing wages; (2) At a time when the parliamentary system is being threatened, reiterate the need to maintain the cabinet's united action; (3) The Socialist Party will never participate in a group that calls for anti-communism and will divide the country; (4) If the government is supported by a reactionary majority, the Socialist Party will withdraw from the government; (5) Require the representatives of the Socialist Party in the government to maintain close contact with trade union organizations; (6) Require the representatives of the Socialist Party in the government to find ways to adjust abnormally low wages; (7) Make effective controls on the distribution of food; (8) Urge the government to reconcile the socialist and democratic factions in Europe and the world to avoid the formation of two opposing groups; (9) Demand peace in Vietnam.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 7th Broadcast: Since the French Socialist Party National Congress voted to support Ramadier's anti-communist policy, strikes have spread throughout the country, threatening Ramadier's wage freeze plan. According to recent reports, at least 50,000 workers in various parts of France are on strike to demand wage increases.</p>
<p>The United States Declares That Its Policy Toward France Remains Unchanged; Italy Closely Monitors the Development of the French Political Situation</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] The rumor that the political turmoil in France was caused by the influence of the US attitude toward France was denied by the US State Department spokesman, who said that the US policy toward France has not changed. US reporters stationed in Paris have sent telegrams saying that if the French Ramadier cabinet can exclude the Communist Party, the United States is prepared to increase economic assistance to France, and that if the French Communist Party attempts to seize power, US assistance to France will be suspended. All these claims are not true. According to a telegram from US Ambassador to France Caffery, all these rumors have no factual basis, and the US Embassy in France is unaware of them.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The French Socialist Party held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the fate of the Ramadier cabinet after expelling Communist Party members. Its resolution may have far-reaching implications for the political future of France and even Western Europe. At the same time, a telegram from Rome said that Italian political leaders are closely monitoring the French political situation. Some members of the Christian Democratic Party led by Italian President De Gasperi have called on De Gasperi to follow in France's footsteps and declare a break with the Communist Party. Most French people believe that the Italian political situation is quite similar to that of France. The conservative Le Monde commented that if the Socialist Party surrenders to the Communist Party, it will be its own demise. We will have two opposing groups in France, just like the two groups that have long opposed each other around the world.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 6th] Observers here expect that there will be changes in the Italian government in the coming days. It is reported that after Finance Minister Campilli and Industry and Commerce Minister Merzagora report on the country's economic situation to the Constituent Assembly between May 10th and 15th, Prime Minister De Gasperi will ask the Constituent Assembly to vote on a vote of confidence in the government. De Gasperi expressed his hope that a member of the labor association could serve as a cabinet member.</p>
<h3>Wallace Writes an Article Discussing the US Policy Toward France</h3>
<p>Stating That It May Cause Unfortunate Consequences</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] Wallace wrote in the New Republic magazine published today that he had the impression in Paris that the United States had proposed a loan plan to France on the condition that the country regress from the "progressive spirit." Wallace said that if France is chosen as the second testing ground for the "Truman Doctrine," this is likely to happen and it can be predicted that it will cause an unfortunate "disaster." Wallace continued that any attempt to use the vast economic power of the United States to drive France to the right and join the anti-Soviet bloc could cause bloodshed. American observers unanimously agree that "creating such a front in France will inevitably lead to strikes, riots, or even bloodshed."</p>

<h3>The Italian-Yugoslav Border Survey Committee's Work Is at a Standstill</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Trieste, 6th] It is reported that the Italian-Yugoslav Mixed Border Survey Committee, which is demarcating the temporary border between Italy and Yugoslavia, has come to a standstill due to different interpretations of the terms of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty regarding the border near Gorizia. The Yugoslav representatives insisted that the city of Gorizia must be included within Yugoslav territory. The Border Survey Committee is responsible for demarcating the border between the two countries before the approval of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty and the determination of the final border. According to the treaty, if the committee encounters problems that cannot be resolved, it should submit them to the four ambassadors in Rome for a final ruling.</p>
<h3>The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly Passes Three Resolutions: Allowing the Arabs and Jews to Attend and Present Their Cases on an Equal Footing; The Five Powers Disagree on the Organization of the Investigation Group</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly met today to discuss three amendments proposed by the United States: First, allowing the Jewish Agency and the Arab Higher Committee to present their views on an equal footing. This point was passed unanimously without a vote. Second, the Political Committee will not make a final decision without hearing the views of the Arab and Jewish peoples of Palestine. This point was passed after some discussion. Third, appoint an investigation committee to report on the issue of which Palestinian groups are qualified to present their views. This point caused considerable controversy. The Argentine representative expressed opposition. The Uruguayan representative stated that, in view of the friction between the British authorities and the Jewish people, Britain should not participate in deciding which groups represent the Palestinian people. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia expressed their support. Finally, by a vote of 31 to 4, it was decided to appoint a five-member committee, composed of representatives from Colombia, Poland, Sweden, Iran, and the United Kingdom, to review applications from various Palestinian groups to present their views.</p>
<p>[Our News] London, 7th Broadcast: Government officials in the United Kingdom said that Stalin had assured Bevin that the Soviet Union was willing to maintain neutrality regarding the disputes between the United Kingdom and Egypt over the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the future status of Sudan. The Egyptian authorities have announced that Egypt will submit the issue of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which has been deadlocked after years of negotiations, to the United Nations for arbitration. It is said that Bevin discussed the issue of Britain's position in the Near East with Stalin during their meeting in Moscow. Stalin seemed to attach importance to Britain's position in the Middle East and Egypt, and did not believe that Britain's interests there conflicted with the Soviet Union's interests.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th Dispatch] The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began debating today the organization and scope of the proposed Palestinian investigation committee. The five powers disagree on the organization of the committee, and even on the nature and scope of its tasks. In general, the United States and China advocate that it be a "neutral" committee, but the Soviet Union believes that a neutral committee has no political power or potential. France believes that a neutral committee has no power, and therefore advocates that if all five powers do not participate, then the United States and the Soviet Union should participate. The United Kingdom, as a country with a direct relationship to the investigation committee and as its original member state, is now taking a wait-and-see attitude. Regarding the scope of the committee's work, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and France advocate for it to be as broad as possible so that it can investigate all aspects of the Palestinian issue. The Soviet Union has not yet expressed its position.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] The United States and Argentina submitted proposals today for the organization of the investigation group. The United States proposed that it be composed of representatives from neutral countries such as Canada, Iran, the Netherlands, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Czechoslovakia, and Uruguay. The country is authorized to submit recommendations to the regular session of the United Nations General Assembly in September on the Palestinian issue. Argentina proposed that the investigation team be composed of one country from the Americas (excluding the United States), one from Africa, and one from Asia, with the power to collect information and report to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Jerusalem, 6th] Goldmann, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency, announced that he will fly to New York tomorrow to attend the United Nations conference and present his views on the Palestinian issue.</p>
<h3>Marshall Sends a Letter to Eaton Urging the Speedy Passage of the Aid to Greece and Turkey Program</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The contents of Secretary of State Marshall's letter to Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, are as follows: Before departing for Moscow, I participated in the consultations on the plan announced by Truman to Congress. While in Paris, I also received a telegram from the President informing me of the full text published on March 12. I immediately telegraphed the State Department and expressed my full agreement. The bill was then sent to the Senate and the House of Representatives. I also agree with the amendments proposed by the Senate. I firmly believe that the immediate passage of this bill is an extremely important matter, and its nature is more positive than the recent meetings held in Moscow. I also fully agree with the actions taken by Acting Secretary of State Acheson during my absence, and I maintained constant contact with him at the time. Your committee believes that this bill, by having the United States carry out active security work for Greece and Turkey in the current crisis, can help the United Nations, and this view is extremely correct. I also believe that this move is not only beneficial to our country itself but also related to world peace. I hope that you will take swift action on this bill.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The $400 million aid bill for Greece and Turkey passed its first hurdle in the House of Representatives today. The House voted 168 to 22 on procedural matters, stipulating nine hours of debate and allowing for unlimited amendments.</p>
<h3>Marshall Urges the Senate to Approve the Four-Nation Peace Treaty Soon</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] US Secretary of State Marshall testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, urging the Senate to approve the peace treaties with the four Axis satellite countries, Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, as soon as possible. He stated: Since the four foreign ministers held a meeting in Moscow, I am increasingly convinced that it is necessary to approve these peace treaties as soon as possible. If the approval is delayed, the situation will likely worsen. President Truman once told me: "If we unilaterally refuse to approve these peace treaties, it will be a great misfortune and a serious blow to our country's leadership position in world politics." Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican, also spoke after Marshall, saying: If we refuse to approve these peace treaties, it will make it extremely difficult to make progress on the German and Austrian issues. Observers say that if Italy is allowed to join the United Nations organization and then requests to amend certain provisions of the Italo-Yugoslav treaty, the United States will likely support it.</p>
<h3>Eaton Clearly Expresses That Communism Threatens the World</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Eaton, Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, said today: The implementation of the US aid plan for Turkey and Greece is enough to show the difference between world civilization based on freedom and based on slavery. No pious hope or absurd emotionalism can conceal the obvious fact that communism is advancing towards world domination.</p>
<h3>Gandhi and Jinnah Meet, Discussion of Indian Partition Issue Unsuccessful, British Government to Propose Compromise</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 6th] Gandhi and Jinnah held their first meeting tonight since 1944. Gandhi had expressed his belief that partition was not inevitable. After the meeting, Jinnah stated: "We discussed two matters. One was the partition of India into Pakistan and Hindustan. Gandhi did not accept the principle of partition, believing it was not inevitable, while I believe that not only is Pakistan unavoidable, but it is the only practical solution to India's political situation. The other matter discussed was the previously jointly issued appeal to the people to maintain peace. We both agreed that we must do everything possible to make that appeal effective." This letter was jointly issued by Gandhi and Jinnah on April 15th at the request of the Viceroy, condemning the use of violence to achieve political goals. Today's meeting between the two leaders lasted two hours and forty-five minutes. Jinnah stated that his remarks had been agreed upon by Gandhi.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 6th] Regarding the issue of internal strife in India, sources familiar with the matter state that the British government will propose a compromise solution acceptable to both the Indian and Muslim sides later this month. The Congress Party has already agreed in principle to the partition of India, but with one condition: that the cities of Calcutta and Lahore be included in the Indian region. This is difficult for the Muslim League to accept, so Britain may suggest holding referendums in the provinces of Bengal and Punjab to decide the division of the two provinces. A referendum will also be held in the Northwest Frontier Province, where the situation is also extremely chaotic.</p>
<h3>The Izvestia Criticizes the US Aid Plan to Turkey</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 6th] Moscow Radio, on the 5th, broadcast an article by Soviet commentator Anatolyev published in Izvestia, stating that President Truman's speech regarding aid to Turkey and Greece has encouraged Turkish reactionaries to strengthen their terror policy against democratic elements.

<h3>Britain and the United States Actively Preparing to Restore Trade with Japan, Will Send Delegations to Japan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters announced today that an eight-member US trade delegation will leave the United States for Japan on the 8th to study the issue of opening up private foreign trade in Japan.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The Far Eastern Commission hopes to open up private foreign trade in Japan on July 1st of this year, but it may be implemented slightly later. After the resumption of private trade in Japan, the types, quantities, and prices of Japanese exports will still need to be approved by MacArthur's headquarters. It is reported that about two hundred foreign businessmen will be allowed to go to Japan to operate. On the Japanese production side, the government will monitor its transactions. Foreign businessmen should negotiate prices and quantities with Japanese businessmen and the Japanese government, sign contracts, and submit them to MacArthur for review. Implementation can only begin after approval.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese officials stated today that Emperor Hirohito visited MacArthur yesterday to thank him for the implementation of the new constitution, but told MacArthur that the new constitution prohibits the establishment of armies and renounces war, making the Japanese people feel increasingly uneasy, because the Japanese believe that the United Nations has not yet provided guarantees to protect Japan. MacArthur replied that the United States would provide such a guarantee.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] Social Democratic Party Chairman Katayama will visit Prime Minister Yoshida on the 8th to discuss who should come forward to mediate the convocation of the summit meeting of the four parties: the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, and the National Cooperative Party.

<h3>Rice Grab: Riots Erupt in Six Locations in One Day, Low-Priced Rice Insufficient for Sale, Common People Resort to Violence, Wanxing on Hongqiao Road Suffers the Worst</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The rice grab trend has recently spread to this city for two days and is particularly prominent today. According to investigations by reporters, there were six incidents in one day. (1) At the Taifeng Rice Store at 217 Harbin Road in Hongkou, around 8:00 AM, before the store opened for business, a crowd suddenly surged to buy rice. The shutters were broken open, and four and a half dan of white rice were snatched. Li Guisheng was arrested by street police from the Hongkou Police Sub-Bureau for questioning. According to his confession, he saw people grabbing rice at the store, and he also followed the crowd inside, carrying half a dan of white rice out, leading to his arrest. (2) The Dingfeng Rice Store at 516 East Yuhang Road in Hongkou received twelve bags of allocated red rough rice from the Social Affairs Bureau. By 8:00 AM this morning, seven bags had been sold. Because selling allocated rice required lengthy registration procedures, the crowd outside became dissatisfied and rushed in to grab the rice. As a result, seven and a half dan of white rice were snatched. The police arrived and arrested six people: Dong Anjia, Dai Kerong, Chen Rufang, Chen Ajin, Chen Amao, and Song Caoyu, who were taken to the bureau for questioning. Because Song Caoyu had a nursing infant at home, he was fined 2,000 yuan and released. The rest were detained for two days as a warning.</p>
<p>(3) The Lingwantai Rice Store at 639 Hai'ning Road, North Henan Road received thirty-five bags of allocated rice from the Social Affairs Bureau this morning and sold it in the store. Because the delivery of goods was too slow, it aroused dissatisfaction among the residents waiting in line to buy rice. At noon, all thirty-five bags of rice had been sold, but the nearby residents waiting for rice were still numerous, so they clamored. With a shout, the doors and windows of the store were completely destroyed. Fortunately, the North Station Sub-Bureau heard the news and dispatched a large number of police officers to suppress the riot. However, the residents still did not disperse, so Ling Wantai continued to sell twelve bags of rice, which were sold out in less than half an hour. The crowd was still dissatisfied and rioted again. Subsequently, the Police Headquarters dispatched two armored vehicles to the scene to suppress and disperse the crowd, and the situation finally subsided.</p>
<p>(4) The Wanxing Official Sauce and Grain Store at 249-251 Hongqiao Road in Hongkou, opened by Zhang Jijiang from Pudong, was also stormed by a crowd at 12:20 PM yesterday due to the sale of low-priced rationed rice. The iron gate was pulled down, and people flooded in, smashing jars and sundries. More than a hundred dozen bottles of beer were smashed, and the glass windows upstairs were almost completely destroyed by bricks and stones. Police officers went to suppress the riot, and the crowd dispersed. Only Xia Yumin, a doctor from Changzhou (resident of 37 Haigeli, Haig Road) suspected of inciting the riot, was apprehended. The store suffered a loss of over 20 million yuan.</p>
<p>(5) The Tongtai Rice Store at 96-100 Ninghai West Road in the Eight Immortals Bridge area received twenty-three bags of allocated red rough rice yesterday, which were all sold out by 5:30 PM. Unexpectedly, there were still more than 3,000 people gathered outside the door. The Songchulu Police Bureau dispatched police to disperse them. After the police left, around 8:00 PM, the crowd gathered again. Seeing a large amount of white rice piled up in the store, they destroyed the wooden gate and rushed in. As a result, more than ten bags of white rice and 700 straw bags were snatched.</p>
<p>(6) Around 8:30 PM last night, hundreds of people gathered outside the door of the Yuanyuan Rice Store at 240 Ximen Road, shouting loudly. Fortunately, the Songshan Road Police Sub-Bureau received a report and dispatched a large team of police officers to the scene to suppress the riot. The police ordered the store owner to open the shutters and sell the remaining white rice at the limited price, and the situation finally subsided after all the rice was sold out.</p>

<h3>Yong Sheng Warehouse in Zhabei Hoards Rice, 1,340 Bags Seized, Found to Be Deposited by Several Rice Stores</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Second Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters recently received a secret report that the Yong Sheng Warehouse at 33 Changan Road in Zhabei was hoarding 1,340 bags of white rice. Yin Gongjun, the team leader of the brigade, led officers such as Xu Zhiming to search the premises and confirmed the report.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Both labor and management in this city are extremely concerned about the thawing of the cost-of-living index. Yesterday, representatives from seven units, including the Shanghai Factory of the Central Printing Plant, the Shanghai Factory No. 1, the Printing Industry Employee Union, the Commercial Press Industry Union, the Zhengzhong Book Company Employee Delegation, the World Book Company Employee Delegation, and the China Book Company Industry Union, totaling more than fifty people, went to the General Labor Union and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition the government to immediately and unconditionally unfreeze the cost-of-living index. The index must be compiled accurately, and fabrication must be opposed. The General Labor Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun and the Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau Zhao Banfu received them separately and instructed all workers to work with peace of mind. The central government will make a decision on this matter within a few days. The General Labor Union also convened a joint meeting of the council in the afternoon and resolved to ask the government to unfreeze the index as soon as possible. According to Chairman Shui Xiangyun, although the government has approved the thawing of the index in principle, the specific measures have not yet been decided. The General Labor Union will discuss what measures will be taken in case the facts are equal to the index not being unfrozen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Economics, requesting that the cost-of-living index thawing measures be carefully considered and decided in a way that takes into account the interests of both labor and management. The original telegram stated: "The thawing of the cost-of-living index brings a mixture of joy and fear to various industrial and commercial sectors. What is pleasing is that the minimum living standards of workers will be reasonably guaranteed, so they will work with peace of mind and improve efficiency, benefiting the future of production. What is worrying is that in view of the threat of high wages in the past, at a time when purchasing power is generally low, the cost suddenly rises sharply, and it is impossible to predict, which will make national industries unable to bear the burden. How should we take both into account and make a compromise? We only hope that the central government will conduct thorough research and make careful decisions so that labor and management will be treated equally and there will be no difficulties in implementation after the announcement."</p>
<p>In addition, there is more than one method for thawing the index agreed upon by Minister Gu in Shanghai this time. In addition to the two types published in the newspaper yesterday, there is another type. That is, wages are divided into levels of 30 yuan, 30 yuan to 100 yuan, 101 yuan to 150 yuan, 151 yuan to 200 yuan, and another level for wages above 200 yuan. Except for the basic amount of 30 yuan, which is not discounted, the rest are given considerable discounts according to the size of the wages. Relevant persons said that all these methods are not currently finalized. The government will naturally take into account the interests of both labor and Yan and decide. Both parties should wait quietly for the results at this time and should not make any statements beforehand.</p>
<p>[Further News] According to Wu Kaixian: The thawing plan and implementation details were handed over to Wang Jiashu, director of the Organization Department, on the evening of the 6th to be presented to Minister Gu first. I will go to Nanjing on the evening of the 8th. The administrative meeting in Nanjing on the 9th may discuss the issue of prices and the index. I will personally attend to explain the various clauses of the thawing plan, hoping to make it pass smoothly." According to his observation, the thawing index plan may be passed at the meeting on the 9th.</p>

<h3>Blank Invoices Given to Others, Three Companies Investigated</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Direct Tax Bureau recently found that the invoices used by Xinhua Bakelite Factory at 27 Deyuli, 698 Zhejiang Middle Road, Xushengtai Copper-Tin Hardware Store, and 713 Hankou Road, Shidexing Box Factory, had three types of stamps affixed: five yuan (temporarily acting as 500 yuan), thirty yuan, and fifty yuan (temporarily acting as 1,000 yuan). However, after investigation, the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued this type of "temporary" stamp, so the persons in charge of the three companies were summoned for questioning. According to them, the invoices obtained by the Tax Bureau do belong to the respective companies, but they do not know the authenticity of the stamps. It is said that Pei Shengyang, an employee of the Meihua Company at 335 Hankou Liuyi, came to Shanghai last July to handle goods. After the transaction, he took away blank invoices.

<h3>Residents Allocated Enemy-Rented Houses Organize Fellowship Association; Will Request Confirmation of Priority Right to Continue Renting</h3>
<p>The former "Housing Allocation Committee for Various Agencies of the Executive Yuan" allocated non-enemy property rented by enemy puppets in this city to public school teachers for residence in order to solve the housing problem of public school teachers in this city after the victory. According to the original allocation method, after the term of the unified rental expires, residents may negotiate with the landlord to sign a lease and continue to live there. However, due to the severe housing shortage in this city and the uncorrected bad habit of "gold bars for roof," many landlords and leasing agents are taking the opportunity to refuse to sign leases with the existing allocated residents, attempting to force them to move out and re-rent at high prices to obtain illegitimate profits. In order to fight for the priority right to continue renting, the personnel in the allocated houses of various agencies established the "Fellowship Association of Residents Allocated Enemy-Rented Houses." The first meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the China News Photography Agency on North Sichuan Road. More than a hundred personnel from the allocated houses of various agencies attended. They unanimously held that the allocated houses were obtained by enemy aliens through contracts with the landlords, and the government has the right to take them over and allocate them to public school teachers for renting. Rent is paid in the same way, and the original owner's property rights are not damaged at all. The allocated residents have now obtained legal tenancy rights, and according to the custom of housing rental in this city and the current severe housing situation, they naturally have the priority right to continue renting. The landlords have absolutely no reason to take them back and re-rent for profit. Therefore, the following resolutions were unanimously passed: (1) The China News Photography Agency is designated as the association's office address. (2) All residents allocated houses in this city will be mobilized to register with the association to expand the organization. (3) Several well-known lawyers in this city will be hired as legal counsel for the association. (4) The administrative and judicial authorities will be requested to confirm the priority right of the current residents of all allocated enemy-rented houses to continue renting according to law, and it is strictly forbidden for landlords and leasing agents to privately rent to others or refuse to sign contracts with the current residents for any reason. Violators should be held responsible for harming public interests, affecting social order, and infringing on the state's right to take over (enemy alien tenancy rights). (5) Action steps: 1. Representatives will be sent to the relevant agencies to express their opinions. 2. Representatives will be sent to the central authorities in Beijing to request amendments to the original allocation method and the formulation of supplementary methods. 3. If necessary, all allocated residents will be mobilized to hold large-scale petitions and parades. 4. If any allocated resident has a lawsuit with the landlord, the association will represent all residents and participate in the lawsuit together to strive for legal protection. 5. Expose the various shady dealings of leasing agents.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Hou Huahua, Deputy Director of the Two Railway Bureaus, went to Beijing last Saturday to discuss the organization of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Company and to request Director Chen to ask the Ministry of Communications to adjust employee salaries.

<h3>A Hawker in Tianyun Building Commits Suicide Due to Lack of Means of Survival; Continuing Lease Problem Still Not Resolved</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the problem of the renewal of the lease of the Tianyun Building of Wing On Company, hawker representatives Wang Yiming, Gu Zhensheng, and others visited Mayor Wu at 9:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Permanent Port Affairs Institutions: Two Major Organizational Principles: No Personnel Changes Due to Political Changes; Maintain Independence in Economic Management: Decided at the First Meeting of the Drafting Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Port Affairs Permanent Institution Drafting Committee held its first meeting at the Municipal Government at 5:00 PM on the 6th.

Zhao Zengjue chaired the meeting, and the two major plans for reorganizing port affairs were decided: (1) Continue the current situation, with each department still managing its own affairs, and establish a permanent Port Affairs Committee to strengthen the connection between them and make decisions. (2) According to the Executive Yuan's instructions, the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee will be announced to end in October of this year, and a permanent institution will be established to concentrate power and exercise its functions. As for which method will be adopted, the committee will submit it to the Executive Yuan for selection and decision. After the meeting, reporters interviewed various committee members separately. Summarizing the opinions of all parties, most believed that in order to thoroughly improve the port affairs of this city, it is necessary to concentrate power and establish a permanent institution, with representatives from the Shipping Association, the Shipping Association, the Lighterage Association, the Import Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the relevant bureaus of the Municipal Government, the local public opinion organs, and the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Water Resources.</p>
<p>As for the organization of the permanent port affairs institution, the Drafting Committee has decided on two major principles in its meeting: (1) The permanent port affairs institution will never change personnel due to political changes, (2) maintain independence in business and economic affairs.</p>
<p>The permanent port affairs institution will have a Supreme Committee, under which there will be a Port Affairs Bureau, whose task will be to implement the plans decided by the High Committee. The production of the Bureau Director will not be beyond the following two routes: (A) the supervising authorities, the Executive Yuan or the Municipal Government shall recommend two or three people, whom the Committee shall vote on. (B) By the committee election recommendation, it will be submitted to the supervising authorities for approval. Any director must be replaced by the approval of a majority of the committee members in order to maintain its permanence.</p>
<p>The organizational details of the Port Affairs Bureau. The discussion was cut short on the day before yesterday, and it is hoped that it will continue to be studied on Saturday of this week. After the draft of the permanent port affairs institution is completed, it will be submitted to the Port Affairs Reorganization Committee for approval, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for approval.</p>

<h3>Graduating Students of National Central University and Others Oppose Comprehensive Graduation Examination; Hold Press Conference in Nanjing Yesterday to Explain Reasons</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The Joint Association of Graduating Students of National Central University, Jinling University, and Ginling Women's College held a press conference on the afternoon of the 7th to explain the reasons for requesting exemption from the comprehensive graduation examination this year, and listed various difficulties, the most important of which are: (1) Due to the recovery and relocation in the previous year, the school year ended early, and some courses were not completed or were not opened at all, and were left to be taught this year, so the coursework this year is particularly busy. (2) The school term started too late this semester, and the class time is extremely short. The urgency of the coursework is conceivable. (3) Notes or books have been lost due to the relocation and resettlement, and the library in the school cannot borrow books, so it is impossible to prepare for the comprehensive examination. (4) After the relocation and recovery, the professors have changed a lot, and the teaching materials used by each person are different, which makes the comprehensive examination more difficult. (5) Among the students who returned from military service, some of the courses exempted from credits are subjects that must be tested in the comprehensive examination. They have no notes, cannot borrow books, and do not know what to do.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Invited University and High School Principals Yesterday to Discuss Joint Examination Methods; Draft Approved and to be Submitted to the Ministry of Education for Approval and Implementation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Deputy Director Li Ximou, are planning to jointly hold the entrance examinations for various universities in the city and the high school graduation examinations this summer. They previously invited the presidents of various universities to discuss this matter preliminarily, and all expressed their approval. However, as this is an unprecedented move and further consultation is needed, they invited presidents of colleges and universities and principals of public and private high schools to a tea party at Kang Le Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday. Present were Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua University, Dong Xifan of Tongji University, Li Shouyong of Jinan University, Qiu Weiyu of Jiaotong University, Hu Wenyao of Aurora University, Lu Jizeng of Daxia University, Hu Dunfu of Datong University, Zhu Guozhang of the Business College, and more than 50 principals of public and private high schools. Director Gu presided over the meeting and explained several points: (1) University entrance examinations: During the war, unified national recruitment and joint examinations by several universities were held in the rear. Although there were many difficulties, the results were very good. (2) The advantages and disadvantages of the high school graduation examinations have been discussed for a long time without any conclusion, so let's not discuss it for now. This summer, the Ministry of Education ordered Shanghai to hold high school graduation examinations, possibly because many high schools have been established in Shanghai after the war, and this is to test the performance of each school. (3) From the standpoint of us in education, and also considering government laws and regulations, it is necessary to discuss a new and feasible method to help thousands of young students in Shanghai graduate and enter higher education. Subsequently, principals and representatives from major universities and high schools raised discussions and suggestions on various technical issues related to holding joint examinations, which were all recorded one by one as references for future examination administration. The joint examination methods were then approved as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Examination Methods</p>
<p>(1) The first freshman entrance examination for the first semester of the 36th academic year of public and private universities in this city (including independent colleges and vocational colleges) will be jointly held with the second high school graduation examination for the 35th academic year (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Examination). (2) The Joint Examination will be organized by a Joint Examination Committee composed of various universities and the Municipal Education Bureau. (3) Matters such as question setting, examination papers, invigilation, examination affairs, and scoring will be presided over by the Joint Examination Committee. (4) Before the examination, candidates should fill out their wishes for further education or employment after graduation through their original school. If they wish to pursue further education, they should also specify the schools, departments, and faculties they wish to enter in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth preferences, but only limited to the university departments and faculties participating in the Joint Examination. (5) The examination subjects are limited to five subjects: Chinese, foreign language, arithmetic, physics and chemistry (biology), and history and geography. (6) The scope of the questions shall comply with the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry. (7) Students wishing to pursue further education will be distributed to various universities for study by the Joint Examination Committee, based on their grades and preferences, after obtaining the consent of the universities. (8) Those graduating students of general high schools who participate in the Joint Examination and whose scores meet the standards for distribution to various universities will be considered to have passed the high school academic examination. Those whose scores do not meet the standards for distribution to various universities but meet the minimum standards may also be included in the high school graduation examination scores. This method must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Yingda University Relocation Movement: Petition Delegation to the Capital Set Off from Jinhua Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from Jinhua, our newspaper] All students of National Yingshi University have vigorously launched a movement to relocate the university. The strike of classes by all departments since the 2nd has been reported in this newspaper. According to reliable sources, a "petition delegation to the capital" consisting of 5-600 people will take the Jinhua-Hangzhou bus on the morning of the 7th to Hangzhou and then Shanghai, directly to Nanjing. All meals on the bus will be replaced with steamed buns. It is reported that more than 170 professors of the university, in sympathy with the students' movement and for the sake of promoting the development of Yingda University, have formulated several points of rebuttal to the Ministry of Education's "allocation of university network, Yingda should be in Jinhua" regulation as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Judging from the state of cultural development in various regions, Jinhua is neither the cultural center of Eastern Zhejiang nor the cultural center of Zhejiang. (2) Dividing the university network based on geometric figures on a map, Jinhua is confined to a corner of Eastern Zhejiang and it is extremely difficult to develop. (3) In terms of transportation, Jinhua is inconvenient to travel to and from other places except for a small section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, Jinhua-Hangzhou. For example, students from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing in Eastern Zhejiang have to spend five days to arrive, and students from Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, and Jiangxi can only detour through Shanghai and Hangzhou to reach Jinhua. (4) Jinhua itself is backward in everything. Its area, population, education, scenery, and social environment are not suitable for accommodating this huge university. (5) Commemorating Mr. Yingshi should be "national." Jinhua is neither the capital nor the provincial capital, and it has nothing to do with the life history of Mr. Yingshi, so it is not enough to express its commemorative significance. (6) The request for relocation is legally based. Instruction No. 26247 of the Ministry of Education on June 2, 1943, ordered National Yingshi University to follow the instruction of the Executive Yuan No. 7904 of Renjia on January 6 of this year, which was passed by the 606th Yuan meeting, "to be changed to National University from April 1943, and its permanent site will be set up in Wuxing, Zhejiang or Shanghai, and temporarily set up in Taishun, Zhejiang before the end of the war." The professors believe that relocation is necessary based on the above reasons, and plan to designate Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Ningbo as the standard for the Ministry of Education to choose a new campus.</p>

<h3>Sudden Tightening of Money Supply: Market Panic; Chinese Stocks All Hit Limit Down; Only Commerce and China Textile Rose Instead of Falling</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The stock market has shown signs of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside for several days. A slight stimulus can cause a storm. Yesterday, the money supply suddenly tightened, and it was rumored that bad checks from short sellers amounted to as much as 2 billion yuan. One said that the central government would have new measures to deal with speculation in the cloth market. It was also said that the bulls received a warning letter, which led to panic. The banking group even released a large number of spot goods. Therefore, the market opened in a one-sided situation, with a lot of selling, and the decline was terrible, which was rare in recent days. In the morning, except for Commerce, all hit the limit down. The beauty market outside the market called for a lower board, and Yongsha also fell sharply. In the afternoon, due to the shrinking of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate, the money supply eased, and the stocks began to turn from fatigue to stability.</p>
<p>Morning Open</p>
<p>People's hearts are already tired, and all stocks are low. After Diyongsha opened, No. 85, No. 183, No. 102, No. 231, No. 163, No. 171, and No. 186 were all sold, and the selling trend was very strong. Meiya from No. 169, No. 91, Firecracker from No. 235, China Silk from No. 189, No. 16, Rongji from No. 223, first hung low to the limit down. Xinhua also reached the limit. That is, the selling trend began. Step down to about 6,100 yuan. No. 231, No. 94, No. 160, No. 219, No. 68, No. 205, No. 129, and No. 47 took advantage of the low to accept, and once rebounded to about 6,270 yuan. Unfortunately, No. 152 was very eager to buy, and Yonggong, Datai, Xinguang, Huafeng, Jinglun, etc. also hit the limit down, and people's hearts turned empty. It was heard that the prices of various commodities also generally declined, and No. 112, No. 117, No. 154, No. 1, No. 65, No. 167, No. 152, No. 82, No. 73, No. 126, No. 89, and No. 197 were all closed, and Yongsha also hit the limit down. Meiya fell another board and there was a transaction. After that, except for Commerce in the market, almost all hit the limit down. Near noon, Yongsha fell 300 yuan and there was a transaction. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Commerce only fell by half a percent, and Wuhe rebounded after hitting the limit down, falling by less than 10%. In terms of delivery, Dongxing rebounded after hitting the limit down, falling by less than half a percent, and the remaining stocks all hit the limit down. Yongsha outside the market called down to 5,500 yuan, and later it was heard that the Hong Kong exchange rate rose, and the asking price quickly returned.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>The market outside the market is already high, only doing immediate delivery. Yongsha was bought by No. 153 and No. 126, and immediately rose to 6,030 yuan on the market. No. 97 and No. 125 were sold, still hitting the limit down. The supply of No. 105, No. 223, and No. 4 was once called down to 5,750 yuan, and No. 235, No. 15, No. 14, No. 219, No. 211, and No. 183 suddenly became smooth. It was heard that the money supply was easing, and it rose to 6,050 yuan. No. 196, No. 125, and No. 105 sold again to 5,900 yuan. No. 185, No. 152, No. 97, No. 231, No. 205, No. 225, No. 14, and No. 117 bought in unison. Commerce first hung up at No. 231, and China Textile also turned red from No. 89, rebounded and rose to more than 6,250 yuan. No. 125, No. 223, and No. 97 sold at high prices, and once retreated to about 6,100 yuan. No. 117 and No. 196 still bought, and at the close, it rose again to over 6,200 yuan. The asking price was slightly stable after the close. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yongsha fell by more than 10% due to only half a day of trading throughout the day. Huafeng's capital increase will be suspended in the future, and it will hit the limit down with Meiya. Xinguang, Yonggong, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Xinhua rebounded after hitting the limit down, and each fell by less than 10% to more than 10%. In terms of delivery, there was half-day trading, and Yongsha, Xinguang, Meiya, Huafeng, Xinguang, Yonggong, and Jingfu all fell. Qinxing rebounded slightly after hitting the limit down, falling by less than half a percent. In terms of cold stocks, Xinya hit the limit down, Commerce rose to the limit, and China Textile changed from hitting the limit down to hitting the limit up, rising by more than half a percent. The remaining stocks rebounded after hitting the limit down, each falling by half a percent to 10%. In terms of stocks outside the market, Nanyang fell by less than 20%, China World fell slightly, and the rest were still peaceful.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks Initially Weak and then Stable</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks were initially weak and then stable yesterday. Due to the unfavorable environment, the securities group sold. Yisha opened at 76,000 yuan in the morning, and British Union at 115,000 yuan. The low price reached 69,500 yuan for Yisha and 110,000 yuan for British Union. The market stabilized slightly at noon. The repeated reports of shrinking Hong Kong-Shenzhen electricity boosted people's hearts. The Guangdong group and the silver money industry took in, and Yisha rose to 81,500 yuan, and British Union ended at 142,000 yuan. Compared with the previous closing, the steel industry rose by 10%, British Union rose by half a percent, and the rest were slightly honored or dishonored.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Government bonds were popular in the morning and weak at noon yesterday. People in the industry in Room 503 and Room 555 sold. Tongbing opened at 19,000 yuan in the morning, and fell from 19,200 yuan to 15,200 yuan. It slightly fluctuated at noon. As a result, compared with the previous closing, A and B each fell by 1,800, C fell by 2,600, D fell by 2,200, and E fell by 2,000 yuan. The transaction was about 7 million.</p>
<h3>Bulls Come Out: Cotton Yarn Spills</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the tightening of the money supply, the yarn market was busy dealing with the spinning and construction of the yarn number and the delivery of goods. Buyers in the market were extremely rare, and even more profit-taking bulls came out, resulting in abundant spot chips, and the price fell sharply. The closing price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 12.2 million yuan, a sharp drop of more than 1.3 million yuan. The minimum price of 20-count Double Horse was once 6.1 million yuan, and the closing price rebounded slightly to 6.3 million yuan, a small drop of 800,000 yuan. Other yarns above 20 counts also fell by more than 100,000 yuan, and 16-count yarn fell by 3-500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Construction Sell Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] China Spinning and Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,089 pieces, including 659 pieces from manufacturers and 430 pieces from yarn numbers. There were a total of 420 application forms from manufacturers and 357 households applying for yarn numbers.</p>
<h3>Falling Prices of Cloth</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market had its prices driven high in recent days due to purchases by non-industry individuals. Yesterday, due to tight credit in the market, and because the Spinning and Weaving Company's supply and sales were quite smooth, all applications for dyed fabric from dye factories were approved, and cloth dealers were also supplied according to their purchase orders. Many holders in the market were selling off their stock. Furthermore, as North China buyers faced difficulties in applying for export licenses, they were divesting their holdings in the market, leading to a sharp price decline. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth fell from 300,000 yuan to 275,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 38,000 yuan compared to the previous day. "Five Blessings" cloth was at 260,000 yuan, also down 27,000 yuan. Other brands such as "Blue Chicken" and "Color Ball" all uniformly declined, ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Twenty-count extra-fine cloth was priced at 230,000 yuan. "Gold Seal" Yuan Tweed fell from 280,000 yuan to 270,000 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" Gold Seal direct-sale wool was sold at a loss of 30,000 yuan, and still lacked buyers. Other colored cloths and Shilin cloth also uniformly declined. Morale was low, and market sentiment turned weak.</p>
<h3>Over 160,000 Bags Already Released, Social Affairs Bureau Revises Rice Allocation Method, North and South Markets Rotate Sales Every Other Day</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] After the resumption of free rice trading, Mayor Wu instructed rice merchants to ensure transactions occur at reasonable prices and to refrain from arbitrary price increases to maintain the people's food supply. The authorities decided to implement a new method for distributing the daily allocation of 9,000 bags of rice, rotating sales between the north and south markets on alternate days, with rice shops in each market taking turns to supply. Therefore, yesterday's 9,000 bags of white japonica rice were all released in the south market, with none released in the north market. The new method involves dividing all rice shops in the city into 180 units, which will be allocated rice on alternate days, with postponements for holidays. Assuming the rice allocation is 9,000 bags, each rice shop unit will receive 50 bags. The areas to which each rice shop group is assigned, as well as the units of each rice shop group in each area, have all been determined by drawing lots.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau announced that from April 15th to May 7th, the bureau had released a total of 161,365 bags of rice. These were divided into four types: white japonica, red indica, Siamese rice, and Saigon rice. As of May 7th, a total of 128,926 bags had been paid for. The remaining are still undergoing warehouse release procedures.</p>
<p>Confused Production Areas Make Cost Calculation Difficult</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Price Evaluation Committee's grain group met yesterday. Rice merchants stated that due to the confused situation in various production areas, it was difficult to calculate costs, so the discussion did not yield any concrete results.</p>
<p>Preparing for Public Sale of Staple Food for the Common People</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from various district offices and police precincts in the city yesterday to discuss establishing public sale locations for staple food for the common people. Over ten people attended, including Director Wu and representatives from various districts and bureaus. Director Wu chaired the meeting, and the following points were immediately agreed upon: (1) The following units can directly apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for rice allocation: students (including those who commute) and faculty of public and private schools above the elementary level, boarding students of municipal secondary schools, students of municipal secondary schools (provincial and national), students and faculty of private secondary schools, elementary school faculty, industrial workers, dockworkers, charitable organizations, prisoners, and shantytown residents. In addition, Director Wu also reached an agreement with Feng Youzhen, director of the Central Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, that employees of all newspapers and news agencies should be included as "news factories," totaling 1,502,405 people, including 100,000 students and teachers. (2) Each person can purchase a fixed amount of rice or flour each month, with adults receiving two dou per month, the poor receiving one dou and five sheng per month, and poor children receiving nine sheng per month. (3) The allocation price will be the same as that for public employees. (4) Public sale locations will be implemented in nine districts, including Aiming, Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Hunan. After the meeting, Director Wu stated that the plan would be submitted to the Ministry of Food for review and then publicly announced for implementation. After the establishment of the public sale locations, rice releases would be suspended, and household rice allocation would also be terminated. Other citizens can purchase rice from the free market.</p>
<p>Rice Market Gradually Softens Towards Closing</p>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Rice arrivals in the market yesterday were still scarce, with 816 shi in the south market and 810 shi in the north market. Market prices were initially firm, but gradually softened towards closing. High-quality white japonica rice traded at 300,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan. High-quality Bo Dao rice traded at 300,000 yuan, medium-quality at 295,000 yuan. High-quality early rice traded at 295,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan.

<p>Flour and Coarse Grains All Show Declines</p>
<p>[Further Report] Prices of flour and coarse grains all showed slight declines yesterday. Foreign flour was at 158,000 yuan, down 1,000 yuan. Local flour was at 105,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan.

<h3>Cigarettes, Soap, and Candles Skyrocket, Authorities Dispatch Personnel for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Recently, stimulated by high rice prices, all goods have soared. The cigarette market has fallen into chaos, especially daily necessities such as matches and soap, which have been arbitrarily raised in price, greatly impacting people's livelihoods. The police authorities are taking this very seriously and have already dispatched personnel to conduct secret investigations, and illegal cigarette merchants will be strictly arrested and punished. Yesterday, the police bureau's economic section summoned Weng Ziyou, chairman of the Cigarette, Soap, and Candle Industry Association, to the bureau for questioning. He claimed that the price increases were due to high production costs. The economic section will send personnel to audit the accounts of Weng's stores, and if evidence of manipulation and price gouging is found, he will be punished.</p>
<p>The cigarette market management authorities believe that most cigarettes, soap, candles, and other items are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. They issued a notice to members to exercise self-discipline. The original text of the notice is as follows: "This association's members engage in cigarettes, soap, candles, matches, and other items, most of which are closely related to the national economy and people's livelihoods. All exchangers must not arbitrarily raise market prices or engage in trading on behalf of customers within the market, thereby increasing the burden on citizens. This association has repeatedly issued notices strictly prohibiting such activities. Now, all goods are soaring again, and the government authorities are implementing economic emergency measures to strictly suppress this. It is hoped that all exchangers will pay attention to avoid criticism from public opinion and sanctions from the law. This notice is issued for all to comply with.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to rectify the market and strengthen management, from now on, only wholesale merchants will be strictly limited to participate in market transactions as member cigarette dealers, and all others will not be allowed to enter the market. It is also stipulated that the capital of existing wholesale merchants must be at least 10 million yuan. Those who do not have sufficient capital must increase their capital in the short term, and those who are unable to do so will be disqualified from market transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Unanimously Decline</h3>
<p>Due to extraordinarily tight credit in recent days, silk and satin prices unanimously declined in the market yesterday. Artificial silk 120 High Mountain Gloss opened at 17 million yuan, with the highest bid at 7.8 million yuan. The noon closing price was 7.5 million yuan. The market was full of selling voices, and transactions were almost non-existent. In the afternoon, the asking price was still the same as the morning closing price, resulting in a drop of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as "Gold Three Horses" and "Dongyang" also declined accordingly. 75 Semi-Gloss also asked for a decrease of 2 million yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Factory-reeled silk also only had asking prices but no transactions in the market yesterday. Grade E was asking for 19 million yuan, but no one inquired. High-grade Another Bale opened at 19.5 million yuan, and dried silk Another Bale was asking for 15 million yuan. The asking prices for each grade were all down by 600,000-700,000 yuan to 1 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Satin goods also had extremely scarce transactions due to credit constraints, and actual sales were sluggish, so factory prices mostly declined. Bedding satin was down 300,000-400,000 yuan, Dacheng Plaid Bi Crepe was down 2,000 yuan, and Hua Jin Crepe was asking for 13.5 million yuan but lacked buyers. Luo spun yarn was also down 500-1,000 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>Sugar Merchants Resume Sugar Allocation Starting Today, Market Prices Already Showing Decline Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The second general meeting of the Price Evaluation Committee has been scheduled for the 15th. The fuel group will hold a preparatory meeting first this afternoon at 3 PM.</p>
<p>The sugar group met at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and decided that Taiwan Sugar Corporation will resume sugar allocation to sugar merchants starting today. The prices are: (1) Special grade granulated white sugar allocation price: 350,000 yuan per dan (original price 295,000 yuan). (2) Grade 1 cotton white sugar allocation price: 330,000 yuan per dan (original price 275,000 yuan). The above prices have been agreed upon by Wu Kaixian, chairman of the Evaluation Committee, and Shen Zhennan, general manager of Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Sugar merchants can apply to Taiwan Sugar Corporation from 10 AM to 12 PM today. Purchase permits can be collected from the company on the 9th, payment can be made on the 10th, and goods will be released starting on the 13th. The sugar used by direct users such as biscuit, candy, canned food, pharmaceutical, Chinese medicine, soda, and snack industries has also been decided to be allocated according to the allocation amount of August 3rd last year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 24 coarse white sugar was 350,000 yuan, and three-and-a-half car white sugar was 330,000 yuan, so the price of white sugar unanimously declined. Peruvian fine sand was 400,000 yuan to 395,000 yuan, down approximately 20,000 yuan. 24 group white sugar was down 40,000 yuan, 20 medium sand was down 15,000 yuan, and Taiwan red sugar was down over 30,000 yuan. Local sugar such as Ti Qing and Diao Qing called for the original price, but no transactions occurred. Shunde Qing was 260,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan. Xinghua White was 400,500 yuan to 390,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan. Xing red was 300,000 yuan to 298,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shortage of Thin Serge</h3>
<p>Recently, grass green, yuan blue, grey plain thin serge has been quite scarce, and the asking price has mostly exceeded that of medium-thick serge. The circulation of market goods is exceptionally lacking, and the rapid increase in price is unprecedented. The selling price of dark blue medium-thick serge is actually lower than that of thin plain serge because American goods are plentiful in stock, and actual sales are limited in the hot weather. White serge is in great demand and its selling price is still higher than that of various colors as usual. Overall, the most popular colors for serge in recent days, regardless of thickness, are dark blue, followed by grey, and then grass green. Yuan blue is last. In terms of price, grey is more expensive. Application for manufacturers 11179.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Exported to North China</h3>
<p>Application for manufacturers 379.</p>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Spinning and Weaving Control Committee is handling the registration and review of applications from yarn and cloth manufacturers for exporting to various ports in Hebei and Northeast China. So far, 379 manufacturers in this city have gone to apply for registration. The deadline for application registration is the 12th of this month for this city and the 26th of this month for other cities. After the deadline, the review process will take approximately another week, and permits will be issued.</p>
<h3>Roasted Green Tea Asking Prices Rise Again, New Qimen Costs Are Not Light</h3>
<p>Since Tianjin buyers have become more receptive to various domestic sales teas such as Hui roasted, Zhulan, and Dafang, transactions have improved and morale has generally firmed up. Prices remain solid. However, the market inventory of 1946 Anhui roasted green tea is almost exhausted, and sellers are less willing to sell, so asking prices are moving forward again, and the market is uniquely rising. Foreign traders continue to stand by and watch the tea market, resulting in the process remaining superficially strong. It is learned that companies such as Xia Wu Chang and Hua Tea are showing signs of renewed interest in last year's Ping Shui batch, but their prices are extraordinarily stingy, only around 345,000 yuan per dan. However, due to the cost of purchasing the goods, negotiations are difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>(Further Report) Qimen black tea, which occupies an important position in the international market, is now approaching the new production season. It is reported that tea merchants in the production area are actively preparing, but this year, due to the high costs of everything, the cost from raw tea to finished tea, plus the shipping costs to Shanghai, is not light. According to industry insiders, it must be sold for at least 2 million yuan per dan in this city to achieve a small profit.</p>
<h3>Cooking Oil Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The market price of cooking oil continued to decline yesterday. Local factory soybean oil was 550,000 to 555,000 yuan, down 40,000 yuan. Jeep barrel raw oil was 580,000 to 590,000 yuan, down 20,000 yuan. Jeep barrel soybean oil was 580,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to oil industry insiders, recent continuous price increases and arrivals from other cities mean that oil factories squeezing oil, which was originally unprofitable, now have a small profit to be made. There were many arrivals from Yingkou yesterday, and the cost of soybean oil was less than 500,000 yuan, so vendors are actively purchasing. The cost of Dalian soybeans, the raw material for oil extraction, is still not cheap, standing at 185,000 yuan. However, if sesame is no longer supplied for export, the current oil price is sufficient to cover the cost of oil extraction, and it is hoped that oil factories will adopt it and supply and sell oil.</p>
<h3>Establishment Date of Cooking Oil Regulation Committee Undetermined</h3>
<p>Qiu Liangrong, chairman of the Oil Extraction Industry Association, told reporters yesterday that the authorities are preparing to establish a Cooking Oil Regulation Committee to supply the Shanghai market with cooking oil, originally planned to be established within days. However, regarding the point that the government would bear all losses from future cooking oil allocation, the Central China Vegetable Oil Factory had previously prepared a calculation table and submitted it to the municipal government for review before the Central Farmers Bank could provide loans for procurement. However, after Mayor Wu considered it, he believed that if the government subsidized the difference between future cooking oil fluctuations and allocation prices each month, the amount would be enormous and would need to be verified and implemented by the authorities. Relevant parties have already sent personnel to Beijing to discuss with the central authorities, and a decision should be made within days.</p>
<h3>New Announced Wholesale Prices for Huangbai Xiangmao and Sunlight Soap, Black Market Soap Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>The China Soap Company, in view of the rising costs of soap-making raw materials such as caustic soda and Japanese essential oils, which have made the original wholesale prices of various soap brands insufficient to cover costs, has readjusted the wholesale soap prices to maintain cost-effective shipments and supply to the market. The wholesale price of 120-block Huang Xiangmao soap has been changed to 250,000 yuan per box, the wholesale price of 160-block Bai Xiangmao soap has been changed to 320,000 yuan per box, and the wholesale price of 200-block Sunlight soap has been changed to 380,000 yuan per box. The company is implementing the allocation of goods since the new price adjustment. Each distributor will receive 10 boxes of Huang Xiangmao, 10 boxes of Bai Xiangmao, and 4 boxes of Sunlight soap, totaling 24 boxes. After the news of this allocation was revealed, the black market price of soap immediately fell back.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoon Loan Measures</h3>
<p>This year's spring cocoon loan has been approved by the Four Joint Offices for 120 billion yuan. The loan will be provided by the China Farmers Bank. Regarding all procedural issues, the bank has expedited the process and will implement it once the Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Industry has separately approved the loan amounts for each manufacturer.

<h3>Nanjing Political Issues Symposium: Tasks for the New Government - Collective Opinions</h3>
<p>For political progress to occur, beyond the qualifications of those in power, another condition is needed: establishing a fresh and potent "political criticism," one that issues relatively sound criticisms, providing the nation's people with an accurate understanding at all times. On the other hand, it can also offer valuable suggestions as a reference for those who are burdened with official duties. Here is a gathering of aspiring and capable core cadres in Nanjing, who discuss national affairs in the form of timely symposia. The most recent one was held on May 4th at No. 4, Dangong Lane, Nanjing. The participants included Mao Songnian, Wang Shuzeng, Wang Xigeng, Zhong Zhaoxiang, Cheng Tixuan, Gu Fengxiang, He Zengyuan, Wu Xingzhou, Jin Shaoxian, Chen Manruo, Cao Yiyuan, Yang Junmai, Zhao Zhangfu, Qian Qinglian, Luo Wanlei, and over thirty others. The topic was "Tasks for the New Government." A summary of the discussion is recorded below:</p>
<p>The so-called new government refers to the reorganized National Government Committee and the five Yuan. However, the exercise of central ruling power and the management of public affairs are truly concentrated in the Executive Yuan. Therefore, what the world focuses on with the new government is what the Executive Yuan will do to break through the current difficulties and create a new path for the future. This is an unfinished task of the previous government and, in essence, does not differ due to the participation of the Kuomintang and the Youth Party.</p>
<p>Premier Zhang Qun's inaugural broadcast on April 23rd emphasized the trial implementation of the Executive Yuan's responsibility system. He then stated that the next eight months would be a transitional phase from tutelage to constitutionalism, and the government's task was to complete the preparations for constitutionalism, restore national unity and stability, and resolve the current financial and economic problems – three major outlines. The entire text was a principle-style declaration, something any politician could say. Even his report to the Legislative Yuan on May 1st did not escape this cliché. If one asks what effective methods there are to realize these principles, it would cost us much searching and investigation.</p>
<p>Premier Zhang once said that future government measures must focus on fundamental solutions. Any matter not related to budget balancing, currency system reorganization, and other urgent and important national and livelihood issues will not be acted upon lightly. His intention seems to be that, aside from these two areas, all other matters should temporarily remain as they are. Those of us discussing current affairs should believe that outstanding achievements must arise from ordinary and practical efforts. Although government affairs are divided into departments, they still have close connections. It cannot be said that other general administration is in a state of stagnation and decline, while miracles suddenly descend, and the budget and currency system alone can reach the other shore first. Today, the primary task of the new government is to strengthen the political foundation and then seek performance. A sharp weapon and good work must consider both substance and function to be effective.</p>
<p>The so-called strengthening of the political foundation involves six aspects: correcting concepts, changing work styles, valuing talent, streamlining institutions, enforcing laws and discipline, and evaluating efficiency. In addition to the necessary official virtues such as diligence, integrity, fairness, and loyalty, those in power in the new government must have an accurate understanding of their duties. Although the nature of the government is transitional, the motivation for governance should not be solely for transitional purposes. Since it is called the Executive Yuan's responsibility system, one should recognize responsibility and dare to take responsibility. The retention or departure of officials should be related to the success or failure of the cause, not continuing the old bad habits, and keeping a heart of dependence on the chairman in everything. As for the concepts of progress and democracy and the rule of law, they should first be established in their grandest form. Only then can one remain steadfast and not be confused when dealing with complex and intricate situations. This is the first point. Regarding future political styles, Premier Zhang stated that the bad habits of falsehood, delay, and procrastination should be eliminated, and a work style that values law and practicality should be established. This is undoubtedly correct. However, the current government has another common trick, namely the ostrich policy. All unreasonable phenomena are knowingly ignored, seeking only to hide the head, unaware of the harm to the body. How can we not administer a strong dose of criticism? This is the second point. Governing requires people, and employing people requires talent. Recruiting talent requires methods. Therefore, the examination and selection system is the core of the personnel system. However, those in power often believe that there are no high-level political talents in the examination and selection system, nor do they intend to cultivate the talents they need within the scope of the examination and selection system. Han Fei said that good ministers must rise from the states and departments, and brave generals must emerge from the ranks. Today's officials, with their art of rising in the world, mostly take shortcuts and side doors, reaching the sky in one step. Few gradually rise through accumulating merits and hard work. With this, they boast about the personnel system and the protection of civil servants. Who are they deceiving? Moreover, the current state's treatment of civil servants has become an object of social pity and ridicule. We firmly believe that improving the lives of civil servants is a necessary condition for strengthening administrative efficiency. The method of improvement can be to set a basic amount based on the cost of living. For amounts exceeding this, forced savings should be implemented. The government can delay payment, and civil servants will not reduce their income. We also firmly believe that cultivating talent in the examination and selection system is the central meaning of strengthening the political foundation. While the personnel system has not yet been truly established, multi-party government is prone to becoming a spoils system. We should also strictly prevent opening this bad precedent. This is the third point. The proposal to adjust institutions has been raised and dropped repeatedly over the years. The central government has also planned it many times, but to no avail. Institutions are like machines and should be just right. Complexity, large size, duplication, and unclear systems are enough to harm political affairs and hinder efficiency. Today, the central government takes pride in establishing more ministries and commissions. Ministries and commissions take pride in establishing more affiliated institutions. Provinces and cities take pride in establishing more departments and bureaus. Each institution generally takes pride in expanding its establishment, adding more personnel, and raising official ranks. We have seen a certain remote and sparsely populated province with simple financial affairs, with worries about the people's livelihood, education, construction, and various bureaus and departments such as social cooperation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, land administration, field rations, and health accounting, all established to the fullest extent. We have also seen that the organizational law of the Resources Commission stipulates that the number of senior, recommended, and appointed personnel is over one hundred for each rank. We should also see that the functions of the Ministry of National Defense have already been divided and managed by various departments and bureaus, yet ten departments are still established to duplicate them. We have also seen that the current organization of the Shanghai Municipal Government is like the structure of the central administrative institutions. These are all strange to common sense and inconsistent with the law. In the future, the organization should be compact and the titles should be solemn. No institution should be arbitrarily established, no official position should be arbitrarily determined, no budget should be arbitrarily drawn up, and no expenses should be arbitrarily paid without being enacted into law by the Legislative Yuan. Existing institutions established by administrative orders must be subject to legislative review. The excess personnel of each institution should be planned by the central government as a whole, so that they can flow to the provinces and counties, so that talents can move downward and the grassroots can be strengthened. This is the fourth point. Strictly enforce laws and discipline, and eliminate corruption, should have both active and passive meanings. The active meaning is that all measures should be based on the law. The reason why officials do not abide by the law is that there are side paths and contradictions outside the law. Therefore, when it benefits themselves, they promote the law to defend themselves. When it harms themselves, they bend the law to serve their own interests, or abandon the law to seek favor, or evade the law to commit fraud. We should conduct a comprehensive review of the current laws, and a comprehensive cleanup of the separate regulations that are not laws, so that the laws are sparse but not leaky, simple but must be enforced. The passive meaning is to do our best to correct illegal and corrupt behavior. While the punishment of corruption is already subject to the law, the detection and exposure should be carried out vigorously and without hesitation. Officials concurrently engaged in commerce are using their power to accumulate assets, which should be strictly prohibited. A general inspection should also be carried out, and those who violate it should be dismissed. Upper and lower levels protecting each other and feigning ignorance are not a sign of national prosperity. This is the fifth point. Today, the government's incompetence seems to have been unanimously criticized by both domestic and foreign parties. In fact, the presence or absence of ability depends on whether the ruling authorities are wise. If they can implement the above five points and simplify the handling procedures and pay attention to institutional management, then administrative efficiency will come naturally, and the government will be capable without urging. This is the sixth point.</p>
<p>With a strong political foundation, we can then seek performance. We are also willing to offer suggestions on your behalf and contribute some ideas. The most urgent problem to find an answer to at present is how to break through the current financial and economic difficulties. Within ten days of Premier Zhang's inauguration, prices showed a rapid rise. The reflection and results of this are that the government's budget is becoming increasingly unbalanced, currency credit is becoming increasingly inflated, the production industry is increasingly shrinking, commercial speculation is becoming increasingly rampant, the economic psychology is becoming increasingly morbid, and people's lives are becoming increasingly unstable. If this continues, the future is unimaginable. Premier Zhang's broadcast speech stated that, in terms of symptomatic treatment, the emergency economic measures plan should continue to be implemented effectively. In terms of fundamental treatment, the established plan should be implemented gradually. The meaning seems to be unclear. However, Zhang has mentioned reforming the currency system or reorganizing the currency system several times, which is very important. We believe that improving finance, stabilizing the economy, and reorganizing finance should all be advanced simultaneously, using both extraordinary and ordinary methods. We firmly know that improving military financial management is a necessary condition for reducing national financial expenditures, improving collection and eliminating embezzlement is a necessary condition for increasing national financial revenue, increasing agricultural and industrial production is a necessary condition for stabilizing the economy, eliminating bureaucratic and speculative capital is a necessary condition for stabilizing prices, and reforming the currency system is a necessary condition for reorganizing finance and restoring credit. In particular, currency system reform is a prerequisite for all conditions. After the war, currency inflation and currency system collapse were common situations in various countries. However, after World War I, various countries first sought to stabilize the economy and then reorganize the currency system. This time, after the war, the procedure was reversed, and they first reorganized the currency system and then sought to stabilize the economy, because the effect was faster. Our country should reform the currency system immediately, using the government's existing foreign exchange and gold, and changing the US$500 million production loan into a financial loan as a reserve for issuing new currency, which should be sufficient. This is related to the fate of the country and the lives of the people, and the success or failure of the new government. Why don't those in power plan for it?</p>
<p>The next urgent problem is to quickly complete the domestic stability and unity. The government had no choice but to take effective military measures to deal with the CCP's comprehensive military actions. We share Premier Zhang's hope that this appropriate and effective measure can quickly achieve the goal of unity. However, indefinite combat is something that today's internal and external situation cannot withstand. We advocate that the treatment of soldiers at the front should be improved, the supply of military supplies and ammunition should be abundant, and the time limit for pacification must be specified, and the pacification results must be strictly assessed. In the past, people said that generals died to defend, and they would not retreat even an inch. Those who wished to avoid the enemy would be punished if they acted rashly. Today, military orders must be strictly enforced, and military law must be enforced. Li Yishan's so-called "Military orders have not been heard of killing horses, and the victory reports only report grandchildren," must never be seen again today. As for the pacified areas, military and political affairs should cooperate with each other, and should not be biased towards one side. The pacified areas are the fiercest place for the struggle between the government and the CCP from ideology and culture to the social system. The Administrative Yuan's Pacification Area Political Affairs Committee has been abolished, but the political affairs of the pacified areas must not be taken lightly. The politics of the pacified areas should quickly seek stability and order after the military recovery, and provide relief to the people's livelihood, so that the local area can protect and support itself. In the military aspect, it is especially necessary to use considerable military force and time to cover the development of politics, so that it is like the Great Wall everywhere, enough to resist the CCP's wandering and help shorten the pacification time.</p>
<p>Finally, for general political issues, the preparatory work for the implementation of constitutionalism now only awaits the relocation and election of members of the Legislative Yuan, members of the Supervisory Yuan, and representatives of the National Assembly. Sun Yat-sen's legacy originally intended to use examinations to save the poverty of elections, but this system has been blocked and cannot be implemented, and will be completely handed over to the electoral activities of political parties. However, how to make the election serious, how to elect people who are truly enthusiastic about national affairs and have strong political abilities, the population must be investigated clearly, the right to vote must be exercised personally, the powerful must be suppressed, and the virtuous must be praised. We hope that the government will make good use of it, and the political parties will reflect on themselves and not desecrate this sacred system. For example, the separation of military and civilian affairs in various provinces is recorded in the Outline of Peaceful National Construction and the National Government's policy guidelines. Although it is the political capital of politicians, reviewing past history, considering the facts, and measuring the gains and losses, it is a good policy that the new government should follow. The so-called separation of powers should be interpreted as civilians presiding over provincial administration, not that the military chairmen of various provinces have retired, so it is said to be in line with the spirit of separation of powers. As for education, it is the most powerful guarantee of democratic politics. If we want to build a foundation for democratic politics that will not shake for generations, even in times of difficulty, the new government should have great ambitions and aspirations to do its best to popularize national education.</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of the Third Session of the Shaanxi Provincial Council</h3>
<p>—西安航訊, April 30th. Our Reporter in Shaanxi: Li Chi</p>
<p>The first session of the third meeting of the Shaanxi Provincial Council opened on the 14th of this month. It was originally scheduled to last half a month, and should have closed today. In fact, it was not until yesterday that the administrative reports of the heads of the various units of the provincial government and the relevant inquiries and suggestions were heard. The fact that this stage of the agenda has been so extended shows that the councilors seem to have many taciturn opinions and countless hopes for the administrators. The closing date will probably have to be postponed for several days.</p>
<p>A Unified Demand to Reduce the Burden</p>
<p>Time is the most merciless test. In the seven months between the second meeting and the current third meeting, has the life of the people of Shaanxi really improved? — To answer this question, we may as well quote a councilor's proposal on the first day: Please review the resolutions of the last meeting to see how many have been implemented and effectively implemented! Yes, in the past ten days or so, we have heard many moving future construction plans in the venue, and even the recommenders themselves do not know when the beautiful "blueprints" that can be realized. The regrets are all covered up by the councilors' tales of blood and tears of the people! Seventy-five-year-old councilor Luo Shian said with tears in his eyes: "I came to Xi'an from Zhenping, Southern Shaanxi, to attend the meeting. The folks in the town cried and sent me out of the city, asking me to appeal to this meeting for relief and to reduce the burden. The people of Zhenping are too pitiful!" Reducing the burden is the unanimous demand of the people of Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Calls for Honesty at the Meeting</p>
<p>Every day at the venue, I really don't know how many times I have to hear this common idiom: "The people can't do it!" As a result, the first council meeting years ago mentioned that the girls in Southern Shaanxi were so poor that they had no pants to wear. Yesterday, the old story was brought up again at the meeting, and it was still said that they had no pants, so it was not very moving!</p>
<p>What is shocking is the reported illegal embezzlement and the listing of figures to illustrate the extent to which the people's burden is heavy. The councilors demanded honest and law-abiding "parent officials."</p>
<p>A Clever Way to Make up for the Deficit Budget</p>
<p>Using "donations" to make up for the deficit budget at the county level is, to put it bluntly, just another name for "apportionment"? In a small county like Linyou, with a population of no more than 30,000, more than 3,000 strong men were drafted during the War of Resistance. This year, of the 600 million yuan deficit budget, 100 million yuan has already been apportioned. In addition, the county's public grain is more than 6,000 piculs. Before Yaoxian was completely recovered, its population was no more than 40,000, and its strong men were less than 10,000, but the compensation for building bunkers and repairing pebble roads was more than 2 billion yuan. Coupled with various temporary supplies, each household has to take out millions of yuan every year! The money spent by the people of Chaoyi County on buying strong men is 300 million yuan per month. Hancheng has a population of 90,000, and the compensation for fodder, transportation teams, mules, drivers and carts, laborers, livestock damage, etc., for which there are verifiable figures, has reached more than 3 billion yuan.</p>
<p>New Suggestions on Grain Administration Issues</p>
<p>There seem to be particularly many problems with grain administration. This stage of the agenda, which was originally scheduled to be completed in three recordings, had to be extended for two full days. More than 30 councilors, nearly half of all those present, asked questions one after another.</p>
<p>In response to the current malpractices, the councilors still put forward the following requirements: grain administration personnel must be honest and upright, good people must be selected and appointed, and embezzlement must be strictly investigated. In addition, four temporary motions were passed one after another: (1) The surplus public grain collected from the land tax in kind shall be returned to the local area; (2) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food shall be requested to exempt Shaanxi Province from the 50% surcharge on land tax; (3) The Executive Yuan shall be requested to stop the collection of land tax in kind and the purchase of military grain from the 36th year, and to convert it into legal tender according to the method of real object; (4) The Central Government shall be requested to stop purchasing military grain in Shaanxi.</p>
<p>In order to support and relieve the rural areas, the authorities have done a lot of things in terms of cooperative undertakings, agricultural loans, and water conservancy construction. However, the councilors from the people are still not very satisfied with it, and believe that some places have changed their nature. Agricultural loans, partly because of the delayed issuance, "distant water cannot quench near thirst"; another part of the loan flowed into the hands of high-interest lenders, which instead harmed the rural areas. Although water conservancy construction has had considerable practical effects and increased agricultural production a lot, the burden on farmers has also increased at the same time since the water fee was changed to collection in kind.</p>
<p>Three Major Problems in Current Education</p>
<p>Looking back at education, teachers, academic atmosphere, and funding are the three major problems at present. For example, the "Bao Xue" established by the "Bao" is headed by the Bao Chief, who is illiterate. How can education be run well? At the end of last month, two middle schools in Yang County competed in basketball and clashed with each other, injuring sixteen or seventeen people and killing three. The school building of the provincial No. 7 Middle School was completely burned down, and the provincial middle school in Yang County was looted. Is this the "academic atmosphere" that should exist today? Talking about funding: some national schools have been in arrears with their salaries for several months to half a year. A certain high school only has 20,000 yuan in monthly office expenses, so naturally there is no mention of how the teachers' salaries are.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang in Jinan</h3>
<p>— Jinan, 4th Day Air Dispatch by He Bingru</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the National Government flew to Jinan from Nanjing on May 3rd for an inspection and returned to Nanjing on May 4th. Chairman Chiang had previously visited Jinan after the Battle of Laiwu, Tusi Pass in central Shandong, but due to the need for secrecy at the time, the Jinan newspapers did not disclose the news. However, newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places still published the information. After all, it is not easy to keep the movements of a head of state secret. Chairman Chiang's visit to Jinan this time coincided with the anniversaries of the May 3rd and May 4th Incidents. On this day in 1928, Chairman Chiang was the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Expeditionary Army, leading a large army to Jinan. Because the Japanese invaders dispatched troops to prevent the Northern Expeditionary Army from advancing north, the May 3rd Massacre occurred. Chairman Chiang was forced by circumstances to leave Jinan immediately and retreated to Dangjiazhuang. Although he later detoured north for the Northern Expedition and eventually completed the revolutionary unification, the national humiliation of the May 3rd Massacre remained forever in the hearts of every Chinese person. Now, having defeated the Japanese invaders and in the aftermath of victory, and at a time when the National Army's military operations are turning towards victory, Chairman Chiang's arrival in Jinan naturally evokes considerable emotion and holds historical significance. The 700,000 citizens of Jinan are even more thrilled and hopeful to have the opportunity to see the head of state for the second time after the victory, because the country has won, but Shandong is still ravaged by war, and the people are in dire straits. Everyone warmly supports Chairman Chiang and hopes for an early resolution of the military situation, so that local order can be restored and the people can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Arrival in Jinan. May 3rd was a partly cloudy day. As everyone was praying for rain, around 3:30 PM, two large aircraft flew in from the south, carrying the head of state, Chairman Chiang, and his entourage. The Commander of the Second Pacification Zone and concurrently Provincial Governor, General Wang Yaowu, and the Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Mr. Pang Jingtang, along with several other high-ranking officials, had arrived at the airport early to welcome them. The first to land was the "Meiling" plane, followed by military aircraft number 260. These two planes carried the leading figures of the nation. In addition to Chairman Chiang and his second son, Chiang Wei-kuo, those who came along included Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense Ministry, Chen Cheng, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the National Government, Yu Jishi, and Director Liu Weizhang of the National Defense Ministry, as well as more than twenty senior staff members. Chairman Chiang and Chief of Staff Chen stepped off the plane in military uniform, smiling broadly. They immediately boarded cars prepared by the Second Pacification Zone and proceeded to the Pacification Zone Headquarters in the city for a rest. At this time, the citizens only knew that martial law had been declared, and did not know who was coming. Some said it was Chief of Staff Chen, others said it was Commander Gu Zhutong, but general speculation led people to believe that Chairman Chiang had arrived; otherwise, such cautious security would not have been necessary. Although Chairman Chiang said his mission in revisiting Jinan was to comfort everyone, everyone knew that he was concerned about the local military and political situation, and even more concerned about the local people. He would certainly inquire about the local situation and give instructions.</p>
<p>Inspection. After Chairman Chiang arrived in Jinan, in addition to asking the leading figures of the Party, government, and military about the local situation, he also lightly traveled to the provincial government and provincial Party headquarters for an inspection. At 8:30 PM on the 3rd, Chairman Chiang, accompanied by several bodyguards, went by car to the provincial government in the city. It was after working hours at the provincial government, and there were no department heads or committee members present, only Chief Qiao of the General Affairs Department was at the provincial government. At this time, Governor Wang Yaowu also rushed to the provincial government. Chairman Chiang sat in the chairman's office for a short while, then went to inspect the West Garden, and then went to inspect the provincial Party headquarters. Chairman Chiang thought the provincial Party headquarters was in the city and only learned it was in the commercial port after inquiring. By this time, the provincial Party headquarters had received the news, and Chairman Pang Jingtang, Secretary-General Yang Pengfei, and various committee members had gathered in the reception room to await his arrival. Chairman Chiang got out of the car and walked into the reception room, sitting down on the leather chair on the south side and began talking to everyone. The Chairman first said that everyone had worked hard, and that he had come this time to comfort them. Now that the military situation has entered the victory stage, everyone must continue to work hard. He then inquired about the local situation, and the committee members answered everything, explaining the plight of the local people and requesting relief. Chairman Chiang listened to their opinions and did not sit for long before returning to the Second Pacification Zone.</p>
<p>Instructions. On May 4th, Chairman Chiang summoned personnel from the Party, government, military, and civic organizations to the Pacification Zone Headquarters to give instructions. He first explained that he had come to Jinan this time to comfort everyone. The military situation has now entered the victory stage. The two most important areas are Yan'an, where the main force of the Communists has been largely resolved, and Shandong, where the National Army has also achieved victory in the Yimeng Mountain area, annihilating a large number of Communists. The temporary abandonment of Tai'an should not be taken to heart, and he believed that its recovery was not far off. The work of the Pacification Zone cannot rely entirely on military affairs; it also requires the joint efforts of the Party, government, organizations, and the people. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard to restore local order and enable the people to live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Farewell. On the morning of May 4th, the news that Chairman Chiang had arrived in Jinan and was returning to Nanjing had spread throughout the city. At the same time, national flags were hung throughout the city, and flags of all nations were flying across the streets. The citizens turned out in droves to await the departure of the leader and to see his glorious presence. In just two hours, from the Pacification Zone to the airport, citizens gathered uninvited along the route, reaching over 100,000 people. The enthusiastic scene was unprecedented. At 10:00 AM, Chairman Chiang, Chief of Staff Chen, and their entourage traveled by car from the Pacification Zone Headquarters to the airport. Along the way, citizens jumped and shouted "Long live!" The shouts reached the clouds, creating a rare grand and enthusiastic scene, demonstrating the people's love and support for Chairman Chiang. As Chairman Chiang's car approached the outskirts of the city, he stopped to inspect the fortifications defending Jinan, as he was very concerned about the safety of the people of Jinan. After staying for about three minutes, he got back in the car and continued on. At 10:30 AM, he arrived at the airport. At this time, leaders from the Party, government, military, and various organizations of Shandong had all arrived at the airport to see him off. Representatives from all walks of life in Shandong, including Pei Mingyu, Lu Ziren, Wu Xijiu, Zhou Ganting, He Bingru, Yang Baolin, Zhang Dachen, He Xiufu, Yu Leting, and Zhao Mingyuan, presented Chairman Chiang with a silk banner inscribed with the four characters "National Savior." The two elder gentlemen, Wu Xijiu and Zhou Ganting, held the banner respectfully for presentation, and Chairman Chiang personally accepted it. Chairman Chiang and Chief of Staff Chen also exchanged greetings with the people who came to see them off, and then, full of joy, boarded the "Meiling" aircraft, which took off into the sky at exactly 11:00 AM, circling over Jinan once to express his gratitude to the citizens of Jinan. Everyone who came to see him off then returned to the city.</p>

<p>Soaring Prices Affect Rent Editor:</p>
<p>My relative is a low-level civil servant, with a monthly income of only over 500,000 yuan. In this time of high living expenses, his family's life is obviously quite impoverished. The price of rice and daily necessities is rising endlessly, which is truly frustrating. However, due to the soaring prices of various goods, our second landlord has come up with the whimsical idea of doubling the rent next month. He has his reasons, saying that the main landlord has proposed raising the rent, so the second landlord has also raised it. Agreed, but the main landlord's increase is extremely small, while the second landlord's increase is double, increasing his rental profit several times over. Moreover, our rent was already raised once three months ago by three times the rent. Now it is being raised again. I know that this is a disguised way of asking you to move out. Once you move out, he can talk to others about gold bars. I think that in this turbulent economic situation, the same situation will affect more than just my relative's family. I hope that the social authorities will quickly establish an effective sanction against this trend. (Kang Zhu)</p>

<h3>Paper Shortage and Cultural Famine</h3>
<p>— Caveat</p>
<p>Recently, everyone has been making a fuss about not being able to buy rice. The rice shortage is causing panic at home. But everyone has not noticed the severity of the paper shortage. It is not easy to buy a ream of paper for 200,000 yuan. If this continues, there may be problems with textbooks in the autumn, and the entire publishing industry will be difficult to survive. Former Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu once said that Britain is still controlling publishing, and our country should do the same. Therefore, on the one hand, we should control the import of foreign paper, and on the other hand, we should encourage the production of local paper. The production of local paper has not been encouraged, but the import of foreign paper has indeed been restricted, resulting in today's paper shortage. Is the consumption of cigarettes a necessity for China's foreign exchange? Or is paper a necessity? We really cannot bear to see the country turn into a situation where it would rather cigarettes become popular throughout the country than disregard the bankruptcy of culture. Therefore, we repeatedly hope that the government will relax the import of paper and open up the import of books in order to save the paper shortage crisis.</p>
<p>Former Minister Wang also said that yellow publications should not be so popular. This makes us think that China not only has a paper shortage but also a cultural famine. Although there are also decent publications, they are not as popular as yellow publications. Some yellow publications in Shanghai do not hesitate to resort to obscenity in order to gain sales. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau once banned these publications, but they have gradually been published again, but the content is even worse than before. I don't know whether the Social Affairs Bureau is still paying attention to this type of publication? This situation makes people feel that China's cultural level is too low and interest is too low. This cultural famine crisis is even worse than the paper shortage.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, everyone sees the rice shortage but not the paper shortage, and the paper shortage but not the cultural famine. But in terms of the future of the entire nation, the danger of a cultural famine is greater than the paper shortage; the danger of the paper shortage is greater than the rice shortage.</p>
<h3>Review of "Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period"</h3>
<p>— Huang Weilian</p>
<p>Book Title: Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period.</p>
<p>Author: Arthur W. Hummel</p>
<p>Publisher: Washington D.C. U.S.A. Government Printing Office</p>
<p>Publication Year: Volume 1, 1943, Volume 2, 1944</p>
<p>Since the English translation of the Chinese Four Books and Five Classics (James Legges' Chinese Classics) in the late 19th century, these two newly published English "Eminent Chinese of the Ching Period" can be said to be a great work that bridges Chinese and Western cultures. Its elegance of writing, appropriateness of collection, detail of record, and breadth of reference surpass any independent work promoting culture; it can also be said to be a great work in the study of Chinese culture by Western scholars in the past fifty years.</p>
<p>This book is purely a kind of promotion of Chinese history, and imitates biographies; however, the importance and value of the book cannot be reduced due to the differences in its style. The great writer of the French Enlightenment movement, Voltaire, said that history is a great performance. No one denies that the life and career of great men is a mirror of the times; therefore, in the biographies of more than 800 people described in these two books, countless historical performances and deeds can be seen, such as the collapse of the late Ming Dynasty and the prosperity of the early Qing Dynasty, and all other important records and related facts. Therefore, this book can provide various historical clues, so that Western scholars can gain a deeper understanding of Oriental knowledge.</p>
<p>Library of Congress, Eight or Nine Years of Work</p>
<p>All great plans cannot be realized in a short period of time, nor can they be accomplished by one person alone; the compilation of this book took eight or nine years of countless people's efforts, and is the result of the division of labor and cooperation of more than fifty scholars representing China, Japan, and the United States in the Asian Department of the Library of Congress in Washington. But the greatest contribution belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Fang Zhaoying, who wrote half of the total of more than 800 biographies. Mr. Fang's work not only accounts for a significant amount, but also exhausts the material advantages. The records of the most important figures, from emperors, princes, and ministers to learned scholars and poets of a generation, are all written by Mr. Fang; and because of his deep foundation in Chinese studies, his records such as those of Gu Yanwu, Dai Zhen, and Ji Yun are even more outstanding. In this book, he pointed out countless great scholars and the progress and regress of the times, as well as their influence on contemporary academics and the trend of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Compared with our country's inherent historical masterpieces, such as the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty," "Biographies," and other famous biographies, the recording method of this book can be said to be much more advanced; this is because the compilation of this book utilized many local chronicles and chronicles, and modern works compiled by Chinese and foreign people; for example, traitors of a generation, or those who opposed politics, or those who opposed academics, which were not taken by the official history, are now included. Furthermore, the deeds of loyal ministers of the late Ming Dynasty, such as Zhu Guozhen and Dai Mingshi, the traitors of the Manchu Qing Dynasty such as Wu Sangui, Hong Xiuquan, etc., revolutionary giants such as Tan Sitong and Kang Youwei, or outstanding scholars of an era such as Cui Shu, etc., are all recorded in detail. Also, because they used countless secret books and personal manuscripts, and even adopted materials that were previously regarded as unorthodox, these great historical figures have reached a considerable position in this book.</p>
<p>Vast Reference Materials, Accurate Translation</p>
<p>The scope of the biographical materials collected in this book is vast and has reference value, such as the personal family background, etc.; and there is considerable progress in literature; and the accuracy of translations, the reliability of birth and death dates, and the consistency of writing all deserve to raise the value of the entire book; the compilation of the index, such as the name index, the book title index, and the category index, is even more refined. At the end of each person's biography, there is also a personal bibliography attached; such compilation work does increase the reference value of the entire book, and is practical. It can be called an important tool for library reference.</p>
<p>Although the greatness of this book is generally recognized, it also has its inevitable shortcomings. For example, regarding the selection of materials, the selected are all ministers, famous generals, and old scholars. Figures in literature, art, science, and religion also occupy a considerable position; but leaders in other professions are rarely mentioned. For example, in the commercial field, such as the merchants of Guangzhou, in the mid-19th century, they occupied a considerable force in the history of Sino-foreign transportation, but only a few people's biographies were selected. Furthermore, the banking industry and salt merchants of Shanxi have a great relationship with contemporary economic and political activities, but they were also not selected. Furthermore, the socio-economic situation of the times, which is emphasized by the trend of modern historiography, is also often neglected; therefore, the social and economic history of our country has become an obscured corner in the study of the history of Chinese academics, and the survival of the fittest cannot shine in this book.</p>
<p>Selection of Figures, Inevitable Omissions</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of individual biographies, there are also inevitable omissions. For example, Ming Dynasty figures such as Li Chengliang, Xu Guangqi, Tang Xianzu, etc., and figures in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, whose life and career were mostly in the Ming Dynasty, such as Ruan Dacheng, Fan Jingwen, Zuo Liangyu, etc., have already been selected, then prominent figures in the late Qing and early Republic of China, whose careers were mostly in the Qing Dynasty, such as Sheng Xuanhuai, Kang Youwei, and Liang Qichao, should not have been omitted. Furthermore, Naming figures in the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy in the early Qing Dynasty should also be selected. Such omissions, especially in the arts, are too numerous to mention. However, the records of Gu Yanwu and Cui Shu are very detailed, while the record of Sun Qifeng fails to point out that his most important work was in promoting Wang Shouren's theory, and at the same time influenced Qing Dynasty academics; furthermore, the records of Ming Dynasty meritorious official Shi Kefa and rebels Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong were not adequately described. The record of Zheng Chenggong only records his resistance war on the coast, and does not record his achievements in Taiwan, which is also inappropriate; in other words, the records of individual biographies and the positions they occupy are not commensurate and equal; some are too lengthy, some are too brief. Furthermore, the Chinese book titles cited in the entire book only have transliterations and no English translations, which makes it inconvenient for Western scholars to use and is a major shortcoming. But overall, the value of the entire book is that its advantages outweigh its weaknesses, which seems to be an undeniable proof; this book has gained a powerful and new position in Western books on Chinese history, and can also be said to have strengthened a new line of communication between Chinese and Western cultures.</p>
<p>Reversing Old Arguments, Discovering New Evidence</p>
<p>Hu Shi said in the preface to this book: This book is a biographical dictionary of the past three hundred years, and its breadth, scale, and usefulness are unmatched by any other published dictionary. It can be seen that its selection of materials, its selection, and its unified translation are admirable. The original biographical materials of our country, all disputes between the two parties and factions, could not be freely recorded. Modern scholars have widely collected secret books, discovered new securities, corrected the previous biographical styles, published the original banned books as much as possible, and gradually promoted the banned figures of the past, which is quite beneficial to reforming the conservative biographical style of China.</p>
<p>Looking at the Chinese biographical literature of the past, its shortcoming is that it cannot record figures related to foreign countries, such as Chinese Protestants in the early 17th century, figures related to the Sino-British war from 1839 to 1841, and figures of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, etc., and cannot utilize foreign materials. The compilation of this book can utilize Chinese materials stored abroad, which can be said to be a contribution to reforming the nature of Chinese biographical materials. This book can be used as a historical reader of China in the past three hundred years, and can also be regarded as a source of Chinese historical materials.</p>
<h3>The Mysterious David</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>——My Favorite Book</p>
<p>When I was a child, I shed tears for Amicis' "Cuore," but "The Mysterious David" is a better and more beautiful book, a moving story, moving writing, moving emotions... Even if all the adjectives are brought out, I cannot express my feelings for this book to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>"The Mysterious David," originally named "Guit David," was written by Eleanor H. Porter. It tells the story of a musician and is also an educational lecture.</p>
<p>David lost his mother when he was four years old. His father, in his grief, was determined to educate this only child well. So, he took him to live in their mountain home. Father and son spent six lonely years in a solitary cottage standing on a high mountainside clearing. During those six years, the father taught his son to play the violin, read French and Latin, and recognize the beauty of life and the universe. David was ten years old. He had great conducting skills and outstanding musical talent, but lacked all common sense and worldly experience. He didn't even understand the use of gold nuggets. To him, illness, pain, and death were meaningless terms. In short, David grew up in the most true, most good, and most beautiful sublime education. His soul was filled with good, beautiful, and bright thoughts. But in the real world, he was just a little boy.</p>
<p>When that father became very ill and knew that he was about to leave this world, he began to wonder if the training he had given his child was beneficial?</p>
<p>The father felt that his life was at stake. Enduring the pain, he carried his luggage and took David away from their mountain home. He wanted to send his son into the real world. Unfortunately, halfway there, the father, unable to support himself, dropped his luggage and died in a cowshed belonging to a farmer named Ho Simen. On that moonlit night in June, the pitiful David innocently played the violin to send his father to another country. Two strange letters, two Van Cliburns, and a gold nugget were the legacy his father left behind.</p>
<p>Ho Simen reluctantly kept the child. David began his misfortune. Every day, he had to do many things for Ho Simen that he could not do and did not want to do, stacking firewood, washing dishes, weeding, harvesting, of course, David was neither competent nor happy. Ho Simen hated him very much. Everyone in the village said that this wandering child was educated in some kind of heresy.</p>
<p>David felt sad. It was the first time that his young heart felt sad. Thinking of his father, he worked hard to play the violin in his spare time.</p>
<p>It was that harmonious and beautiful violin sound that gradually made David loved. His friends became more and more every day. A blind child, a college student with lung disease, and his sister, as well as that beautiful and wealthy little group who were always worried, all received David's comfort.</p>
<p>People gradually liked him, this extraordinary, moving, and good child.</p>
<p>David could not forget his world of music. Once, he planned to use those gold nuggets to study at a music school, so that he could play the violin better - but, but unfortunately, something bad happened. Ho Nanmen's bank where he saved money went bankrupt. Creditors were coming to find them for trouble. In his anxiety, a ray of light shone in David's eyes. He gave all his gold nuggets to this couple crying in rags. This homeless wandering child solved their problem. From then on, David's position in Ho Nanmen's family was different from before.</p>
<p>David could no longer dream of his beautiful world - a musical future, but he still played the violin, and because of his violin sound, estranged fathers and sons reconciled, broken lovers were reunited, hatred turned into love, weakness turned into health, and the unbeautiful world became beautiful.</p>
<p>After returning, Ho Simen's music-loving son saw David's father's letter and discovered that the deceased was a world-renowned musician, a cellist. Then, all the ignorant people in the village were shocked. Ho Simen could not keep this child privately, because outside there were tens of thousands of friends, reputation, positions, audiences, and money waiting for him! David belonged to this beautiful world! But after that, he would bring his violin back to this lonely little village once a year to play the violin for this old couple to listen to.</p>
<p>The story ends like this, plain, very plain, without any earth-shattering heroic acts of sacrifice, but there is a lot of love, and there are tortuous and bizarre tense plots, but every moment it grabs people's heartstrings and moves people's feelings and tears.</p>
<p>After reading this book, it arouses people's desire, a desire to see a child like David, who does not necessarily play the violin or is as beautiful and intelligent as him, but must be good, innocent, and ignorant enough to regard robbers and kidnappers as saints, and have a pure and charitable heart...</p>
<p>But, disappointingly, it always feels like most children are too smart. In fact, maybe it is that most parents are too foolish. We only need to see the education and training that the musician gave David. Although he himself doubted its wisdom, in fact, he was very successful. Even though David also suffered some difficulties because of that peculiar education, this world itself is still beautiful, and even if it is not beautiful, it will become beautiful. Why do discerning parents not allow their children to receive some good and beautiful training and education?</p>
<p>Whenever he sees some children who are as experienced as adults and as sophisticated as he is, he feels too bitter for them, like mourning a middle-aged person who is prematurely old, and regrets that they have lost their innocence; at the same time, he thinks of the mysterious David.</p>
<h3>Zhang Daqian Copies Dunhuang Murals</h3>
<p>— Zhou Cong</p>
<p>(Color Edition of Dafengtang)</p>
<p>(Distributed by Xuanhe Printing House, Hankou Road, Shanghai)</p>
<p>This collection of twelve paintings are all figure paintings from the Tang Dynasty. The structure is rigorous, the colors are gorgeous, and the brushwork is excellent. The organization and stripes used in the second painting have greatly influenced the Fauvism of modern Western painting and the woodcuts of the Soviet Union. The caisson ceiling in the third painting is an extremely elaborate decorative pattern. The eighth painting, "Mother and Daughter Offering," depicts two prostitutes abandoning their lowly status to become virtuous. It can already prove the degree of advancement in dyeing techniques during the Tang Dynasty. The image of King Cao Yijin of Khotan in the tenth painting has blue eyes and blond hair, wearing a bestowed vermillion robe. The eleventh painting, his wife Lady Li, with her emerald hairpins and golden sparrows, powder and rouge, all showcase the superb skills of figure painting at that time. It is as if we are reading Bai Juyi's "New Yuefu Poems," gaining a complete view of the strange decorations of Tang Dynasty women. As for the aluminum inscriptions on the images, it is like reading Tang Dynasty handwritten scriptures, which is an unexpected gain!</p>
<h3>Between "Just Born" and "Not Yet Dead"</h3>
<p>— Dong Yuan</p>
<p>Written by Yu Chao, Mao Dun, et al., printed by Xiaoya Publishing House</p>
<p>China's New Culture Movement is currently in a state "between 'just born' and 'not yet dead'," and its significance lies in the fact that our past New Culture Movement "almost uncritically accepted all foreign ideas, and was so conceptually vague and inconsistent," thus creating the current state.</p>
<p>In this book, the reader is told that in this state between "just born" and "not yet dead," the New Culture should follow a path of "no longer blindly negating and criticizing, but critically accepting cultural heritage," so as to establish a "solid cultural front and a complete ideological system," and harvest the rich fruits for our cultural movement.</p>
<p>The progress of history not only deepens people's understanding, but also broadens people's minds. The eight-year great national war has gradually made people aware of self-liberation and awakening from a state of ignorance. The forging of life is most able to inspire progress. I can confidently say that the articles in this book are all quintessential works that have been forged.</p>
<p>The preface contains such a beautiful passage: "Let the roaring wind on the plains be our teacher, let the free-floating white clouds be our teacher, let the affectionate night moon enveloping the flowers in the courtyard be our teacher..." In addition to these, today's bloody reality is our teacher, precisely because "life is a great epic, it is majestic, it is also gentle; it is like a clang, also like a secluded spring pouring out..." We should learn from it!</p>
<p>This volume is co-written by four gentlemen, Yu Chao, Xiang Li, Jia Li, and Mao Dun. The title of the book is based on Yu Chao's article "Between 'Just Born' and 'Not Yet Dead'." In this article, Yu Chao described:</p>
<p>People's numbness, fatigue, depression, and wait-and-see attitude have dominated the past twenty-five years. Of course, this is not the whole picture of society, but represents a corner. Based on this, the author narrates the beginning and end of the New Culture in the past twenty-five years, which is concise and clear.</p>
<p>Xiang Li's "Sensual Life and Rational Life" and Jia Li's "The Three Degrees of Life" are good guides to life. Mr. Mao Dun wrote "On the So-called 'Three Degrees of Life'" based on them, and put forward a good attitude and path to be taken in life.</p>
<p>In addition, Yu Chao's "On Attitude to Life and Realism" and Xiang Li's "On Artistic Attitude and Attitude to Life" provide more specific guidance to life.</p>
<p>We must learn from life—especially cultural workers—these articles are a must-read.</p>
<p>As Mr. Yu Chao said: "We are exactly between 'just born' and 'not yet dead': the poison of the old tradition has not yet died, and the new culture has not yet taken root universally; our task is very simple, to call the 'not yet dead' to die quickly, and to call the 'just born' to be born quickly..."</p>
<p>This is the clear path of today's cultural circle, and inevitably, we should take this path!</p>

<h3>Feeling After the Rice Riot in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The folk customs of Hangzhou have always been very vigorous; therefore, people from other counties ridiculed them saying: "Hangzhou iron heads". Last March, it reappeared, although it is something that should not have happened under the rule of "law", it just shows the "vigorous" spirit of Hangzhou people.</p>
<p>It is said that the cause of this incident was: Hangzhou citizens discovered that the Deputy Director of the Provincial Food Bureau and the Chairman of the Hangzhou Rice Industry Association colluded to hoard rice, so that the official rice priced at 127,000 yuan per picul could not be purchased, and the black market rice rose to 260,000 yuan per picul. Ordinary people had no means of livelihood, and finally gathered more than a thousand civilians in Shishi, Xi cheng, and Qingchun Street, to start a "riot"!</p>
<p>I don't know whether the municipal government has a statistical record of the food supply in the urban area on weekdays, how many piculs are needed every day? Did it already know that all the rice stores in the city were not selling official-priced rice before the "riot" occurred? And did it strictly review the "allocation of rice" report on weekdays? I believe that the municipal authorities must be carrying out the above three issues on a daily basis; then, the people who carried out the review should also bear a large part of the responsibility for this "incident".</p>
<p>The people who cause trouble are all driven by temporary righteous indignation, and are by no means plotting rebellion for a long time with ulterior motives; after the incident, how should the municipal authorities appease the people, announce measures, and how should they provide relief and broadly implement benevolence? Now, to use "martial law" to suppress and deter, "using softness to overcome hardness," it is hoped that those who govern in Hangzhou will learn from it.</p>
<h3>News Summary</h3>
<p>— Tieyun</p>
<p>The rice-snatching trend is only present in years of famine. But this year's rice-snatching storm was affected by price fluctuations. Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuxi, and Chengdu have all opened up rice-snatching. If prices are unable to stabilize, and rice prices jump over the 300,000 mark again, social order is worrying.</p>
<p>When a newspaper reporter writes social news, he must first establish a major premise himself. His implication to the reader must be psychologically healthy, and deliberately exaggerating a common influence is too great: at the same time, one's view and attitude towards an event is also unfair.</p>
<p>What do wise social news writers think?</p>
<p>Some say that religion is the brother of politics, and it can help politicians rule their kingdoms. Given the enormous religious power of various countries in the world, and the exhortation of religious figures to "be content and abide by the law," is the most politically meaningful slogan.</p>
<p>Recently, a film "Song of Bernadette" was shown in Shanghai, and some people criticized it "completely", because the film negates science and vigorously advocates the effectiveness of "God's words".</p>
<p>Recently, in a church in Rome, it is said that "fresh blood" actually flowed from the "wounds" of the statue of Jesus, causing a sensation among believers who went to worship.</p>
<p>Although the priest in the church has reasonably explained that the so-called blood is actually just the reflection of light on the oil paint painted on Jesus' wounds, and is not really blood, the "believers" ignored it.</p>
<p>People who have been influenced by the enemy for eight years also know how to play political tricks in daily life. For example, for a little private hatred, they will also file a complaint with the security authorities, put a "hat" on their "enemy", this trend was not heard of in pre-war Shanghai, but now we have seen it.</p>
<p>The spirit of Shanghai people is also declining.</p>
<p>Humans are busy using radar and atomic energy, but we are talking about "fatalism," how terrible this is!</p>
<p>The Japanese have rules and plans to develop various constructions and trades. Their products will follow "Uncle Sam" to conquer the whole world, and China is naturally one of them. But what are the Chinese people busy with?</p>
<p>Zhang Lijingying, a stall vendor in Tianyun Building, went mad after hearing that the authorities' solution was fruitless.</p>
<p>Actually, in this day and age, who isn't a little crazy?</p>

<h3>Business Competition</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Two Jews opened a store across the street from each other, desperately competing in business. In addition to large discounts, they also came up with various methods to defeat each other, and even planned vicious ideas when sleeping at night. One night, a Jewish immortal walked to the bedside of one of them and said to him, "You can have whatever you want. But whatever you have, your colleague will get twice as much."</p>
<p>"Is there such a thing?" the Jew said, "Then there's no problem, I want to go blind in one eye."</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"New Arabian Nights"</h3>
<p>— Wubian</p>
<p>After patiently enduring ninety minutes in the theater, I barely finished watching "New Arabian Nights". Walking out of the theater, I couldn't help but feel sad for these filmmakers, and also regretted the thousands of feet of film.</p>
<p>After more than twenty years of struggle and hard work, domestic films have progressed from "fire-burning" and "martial arts" stories to realistic themes. This is the power of the times and the result of the efforts of those progressive film practitioners. Unexpectedly, on the day of victory, there are still people making such boring films, and one can't help but feel distressed for domestic films.</p>
<p>From any point of view, there is no reason to make a film like "New Arabian Nights". Looking around, there are too many worthwhile subjects, but "Great China" does not hesitate to waste manpower and resources to make this incomprehensible film. Besides explaining the company's mistaken filmmaking route, it can only be explained as a shameful act of trying to make money by any means.</p>
<p>This story is copied from "Arabian Nights", and the screenwriter has made it completely nonsensical, which is really inexplicable. The progress of the plot is entirely at the mercy of the playwright, and the characters here have no thoughts, personality, or life, like puppets in a puppet show. What does the theme of the script try to express? I'm afraid even the playwright didn't figure it out, so how can you teach the audience to understand? Therefore, Dan Du, an "artistic director" who has always been immersed in "aesthetics," tries to use erotic scenes to sell himself and satisfy the desires of petty citizens, but now, unfortunately, even this point of selling has failed. The "sensuality" and "eroticism" scenes in this film are simply dwarfed by Hollywood's "leg" films. As for the flying carpets, flying ropes, and large-scale fighting scenes, they make the audience feel ridiculous and laughable. Perhaps some people think that the films directed by Dan Du Zi will not be too bad at least in terms of photography, written material, light, and angle. Then this film will also give you a big disappointment. This leads me to think that the fate of an artistic worker who cannot keep up with the times is sad.</p>
<p>None of the actors in the whole film are acceptable. In fact, what can you ask of them for such an incomprehensible script? Even if you hope to get some sensual stimulation and erotic satisfaction from the film, it will also disappoint you greatly. We hope that Great China Film Company will no longer produce this kind of boring film.</p>
<h3>The Difference Between the British and Americans</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Clown A: I would rather perform for the British than for the Americans.</p>
<p>Clown B: What's the reason?</p>
<p>Clown A: When the British watch a performance, they smile for the first time out of politeness; the second time, the emperor has already smiled, and he smiles along; the third time, he understands it himself, and smiles again.</p>
<p>Clown B: Then what about the Americans?</p>
<p>Clown A: Oh, they never smile, pretending they've seen it all before.</p>
<h3>Criminal Asks to Have Brain Cut</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>The Associated Press has a telegram from Pittsburgh saying that a habitual thief, Ryder, who has many cases against him, recently obtained permission from the court to voluntarily accept a prefrontal lobotomy experiment. During the operation, a certain doctor cut the prefrontal lobe from the rest of the brain. Now this person has been refreshed and eats normally. As for whether he can abandon evil and return to righteousness from now on, it remains to be proven by his future behavior.</p>
<p>According to the method of cutting off the head, there were early cases of it, but it is a pioneering act for criminals to request it themselves. According to the March issue of Life Pictorial, although this type of surgery is still in the experimental stage, it has already achieved a 60% success rate. The criminal's willingness to accept the cut fully shows that there is a tendency in his heart to abandon the dark and turn to the light. Unfortunately, this tendency cannot prevent him from stealing chickens and dogs on weekdays, just like the protagonist in Stevenson's famous novel "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", although he has a heart for good, he cannot prevent himself from doing evil. He must have sought help from his own conscience, but asked himself inwardly, from his self-esteem and shame, he still could not stop him from doing wrong from then on. From the fact that Ryder, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, requested a brain cut, it can be seen that he was never disappointed in himself. Although he is a criminal, he can be regarded as a representative of Adam's descendants. Although our human beings have been full of evil, our conscience of doing good has not died. Our future hope lies in this place.</p>
<p>Someone said that the reason why our world is so chaotic is only because the progress of social science lags far behind that of natural science. After reading the news about cutting heads, we feel that to save this world, we still need science. The long-disputed question of the goodness or evil of human nature should be answered from now on. We should be convinced that everyone has a kind soul, and it is the skin that has never had a solution that makes him do evil. People's talents are different, only different in their bodies, not different in their souls. From this standpoint, our left and right neighbors should also have some changes in their attitudes towards life. This is not to say that we should condone those who do evil, but to treat them as the same people as us and change them.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a City in Crisis</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Director Xiong was listening to the phone.</p>
<p>Old Zhu, who had been provoked to forget everything, walked down unceremoniously and snatched the microphone from his hand.</p>
<p>"Director Xiong, you promised to let us leave tomorrow, but my procedures have not been completed yet! Because your Section Chief Yu wants to talk about official business!" he said loudly, completely like an interrogation.</p>
<p>The other party's face also flushed, showing that he was very dissatisfied with his rudeness.</p>
<p>"At first, he wanted me to ask you for approval, and thanks to your help, you have already approved it! But he wanted me to handle official business separately and add a list, and I followed him to do it together! Now! But, in the end, he said that there is no official seal on my official letter and it cannot be accounted for! Official business! Official business! So many people in China are handling official business every day, and they have only handled it to this day! If such official business is to continue, China will surely perish!" He simply didn't give the other party a chance to speak, and vented his pain. "Now please say one more sentence, will you let us go or not? If you let us, just tell us when and where to get on the bus! If you don't let us, I, surnamed Zhu, will leave immediately!"</p>
<p>Director Xiong, who was being rammed by him, was almost unable to bear it, but listening to him talk about the experience of being repeatedly embarrassed by Section Chief Yu, and looking at his two arms that were shaking violently, he couldn't help but evoke a little of the original humanity.</p>
<p>"Don't be angry! Don't be angry!" He stammered and put his arms around Old Zhu's shoulder, saying as if comforting a child: "Official business is official business, I will let you go tomorrow, how about I see you off on the bus?" (66)</p>
